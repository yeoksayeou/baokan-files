Two Days in the Mine
    An E
    Because we were half an hour late, we messed up the traffic schedule that had been arranged for us. A two-hour journey took five hours.
    It was completely dark, and the rain was neither heavy nor light. All the personnel of the Mining Bureau and the Municipal Government were busy with the Labor Model Commendation Conference these days. After getting off the bus, we boarded two passenger cars and arrived at a cadre dormitory in the city. These were two large rooms that the owner of the house had just vacated for us, one for men and one for women.
    Secretary-General Zhang arrived and immediately apologized repeatedly, saying that other houses were being prepared, and that we should go to eat first. Secretary-General Zhang was a very ordinary person, not attracting anyone's attention. If he hadn't given us a short report the day we left, we would never have known this steely old cadre!
    After dinner, we were led to a hotel that looked even better than those in Shanghai and Hong Kong, but the furniture and equipment in the rooms had been ravaged by the Kuomintang military officers.
    　　　×　　　　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　　　　　×
    Today's schedule: visit the open-pit mine in the morning and the vertical shaft in the afternoon.
    While waiting for the light train at the entrance of the open-pit mine, we happened to meet the workers getting off work, so we chatted with them. They felt that everything was good. Food was good, clothing was good, wages were good, medical care was good, children's education was good, their own learning was good, everything was good. Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, New Democracy, Socialism, the Soviet Big Brother, even better. When talking about some areas that were not yet up to par, they said:
    "It's not far off. Anyway, as long as we improve our technology, increase production, and improve quality, the entire mine will be restored, all the reactionaries will be eliminated, and the mine will develop further. In a few years, everything will be good. ... Now that we have the experience and help of the Soviet Big Brother, it will be even faster! Now we don't even use dynamite to mine coal anymore. The higher-ups said that it was too dangerous and didn't guarantee the safety of our workers' lives. We switched to using picks, but that was too slow, and we were really worried. Now that our trade agreement with Northeast China and the Soviet Union has been finalized, new coal mining machines are coming, which will be high in output and safe. How great is that!"
    Their words were so peaceful and confident, showing the demeanor of masters. It made us feel ashamed. "We were so far behind you!" we said in our hearts.
    However, the expression in their speech was not as "lively" as we had imagined. Compared to intellectuals, especially those in the theater, they seemed bland. This made us understand: "Why when we play workers, no matter how hard we try, the expression is 'profound,' but it's never quite right." Today we saw it, their "profundity" and "liveliness" are not in the outward appearance of daily life. Only when they stand in front of the machine do they show their true colors, each one is full of energy, smart, agile, and firm...
    The conversation gave us a conclusion: workers value collective interests above all else. Everything is for the collective interest, not afraid of burying personal credit. In Harbin, Changchun, and Shenyang, it is the same. No wonder a rumor of a ghost once occurred at Anshan Iron and Steel. It happened during a competition, when two workers in a certain group secretly stayed in the factory every night to work overtime. Therefore, the charging car parked on the ground every night would always be suspended at the top of the furnace the next morning when work started. -- There was no ghost, how did he get back up there himself?" The rumor of a ghost in the factory spread.
    Cadres secretly guarded the big furnace in the middle of the night and finally found the two of them. The next day, they explained the situation to the workers, and the ghost stopped haunting. Now, the guards in each factory not only have to prevent fire and spies, but also have to prevent workers from hiding in the corners of the factory after work, fearing that it will affect their health.
    The light train arrived, and our group was the first to board. It was clearly going downwards, but it felt like flying through the clouds. It is said that this was a specially slow train for us intellectuals.
    The feeling was not bad, but I was afraid of the wind and hid in the middle of the crowd, unable to appreciate the full view, only seeing some through the cracks.
    After getting off the train, we sat on the coal to wait for the second batch to arrive. We chatted with the workers again. The impression we got was still: bright, firm, modest, focused on the big picture. They all said that imperialism and their dogs were worthless and would definitely be eliminated! A new society will definitely be realized. They were almost like one person, only able to distinguish their voices and faces, not their thoughts and consciousness.
    "We think this place is really beautiful, do you also think this place is beautiful?" we asked.
    "How can it not be good? Aren't those power poles like a big forest? We workers are the tree planters. This big mine, so many machines, so much coal is under our care."
    "What did you think during the enemy puppet, Kuomintang period?"
    "At that time, we didn't even have enough to eat! Acorn flour was so constipating, we were so hungry that our eyes were dizzy, how could we have time to think about these things! We just thought of ways to steal some coal and sell it for a few pennies to spend. ... Comrades, where are you from?"
    "Beijing."
    "Beijing! Tangshan Mine is also getting close, have you seen it?"
    "We'll see you here first."
    "It's the same everywhere, but the places that were liberated earlier are always a little cheaper. Anyway, sooner or later everything will be done well. As the saying goes: with Chairman Mao and the Communist Party leading, how can it not be done well? Quick! It won't take many years!"
    The second batch of people arrived, and we went to visit the bottom of the pit. Everyone was very excited after coming up.
    In the afternoon, we visited the vertical shaft, but we didn't go down, because for however many of us went down, there would have to be the same number of people to protect us, which would delay production too much. It is said that just going down that hollow elevator is hard for people with bad health to endure, especially our literary group. It's better for the elderly and women to be realistic. Just looking at the machines above was exciting enough. In one part, such a big room of machines was controlled by only one worker, how impressive!
    Originally, there was Peking Opera to watch in the evening, but no one wanted to watch that sing-song anymore, because thinking about it, it was too incompatible with the content and power of the daytime, and we couldn't switch over emotionally.
    　　　×　　　　　×　　　　　×　　　　　　×　　　　　　×
    The next day, we ran down to the garden very early. Cameras were clicking everywhere. Songs rang out, and our "silent" visiting group had a voice from the moment we entered the industrial area. A song from "Liu Hulan" became our group song, "You Are the Beacon," "The Sky of the Liberated Area," "Without the Communist Party, There Would Be No China," "The East is Red," "The Internationale"... one after another...
    We walked into the Labor Model Commendation Conference. The special-class models, wearing big red flowers, were sitting in the first few rows in the middle of the venue. The collective models and models also wore red flowers and filled the entire venue. We were entertained in the first few rows on the right. The special models politely kept giving us cigarettes and tea..., alas! It's even harder to bear than beating us! That great and sincere host demeanor made us flustered!
    "Don't be like this, okay? Comrades! I can't take it!" we said in our hearts, almost shouting it out. Everyone looked at each other, and shame weighed down our hearts!
    This meeting had already been going on for a day yesterday, and the report of the special-class model Zhang Zifu had already passed, regretting not coming yesterday.
    Today, we listened to the reports of a total of five special-class models.
    Their speeches were frank and natural. If it was good, it was good, if it was bad, it was bad, not caring at all, as long as they could convey the content. They described their work, and as they spoke, they became very proud, not hiding the joy in their hearts at all. This is something that we petty bourgeoisie dare not do. I remember once when the shipyard worker Wang Shuiting, who wrote and directed "Er Mao's Merit," laughed heartily and couldn't finish his words when he talked about his work winning an award. Everything they do is for the interests of the class, so they are proud, they dare to speak, and most importantly, they dare to do!
    Special Model Zhu Ying described his mine repair work: "Last year, the mine caved in, right on the throat road. I felt a great responsibility. ... Eighteen of us took on this work. The higher-ups were worried and said, "Stones will fall down!" I said, "I guarantee there will be a way even if they fall!" But the top caved in again after being cleared, and caved in again after being cleared. I was afraid of stones when I saw them. As long as one fell, the top would all collapse. The place was narrow, and everyone could only turn in and out sideways. A two-ton stone really fell down, six meters away from me, and the top really collapsed.
    It was so hot in the pit that we couldn't breathe, and we had to spray it with cold water all the time, making us shiver all over. ... I don't have any special abilities, only courage. I do everything first and take the lead.
    Now the Party is a big lantern, illuminating our future. I hope everyone will be better than me, above me. ... Today's meeting is the greatest glory of my life."
    Carpenter Shen Guochun said: "... The higher-ups gave me the task of completing it in nine months. I said, 'Okay!' Later, the higher-ups saw that I was working fast and asked me to complete it earlier. I said, 'Okay!' In my work, whenever other carpentry groups were worried about work, I would say, 'Okay. If you can't do it, we'll do it.' The higher-ups saw that we were doing it fast and said, 'Put in some more effort! Win the victory flag!' We said, 'Okay! We are determined to win it! And keep it forever! Not let other groups win it!'
    I bragged, but I couldn't do it alone by just working harder, I had to mobilize everyone...
    We learned while working, improving our political awareness. We realized that the New Democratic society is different from the old society of Little Japan and the Kuomintang. We not only want to do well in the New Democratic society, but also want to move towards a socialist society. We thought, 'Not only will this generation be good, but future generations will be even better. Since the Communist Party came, the rice in the box has never been empty, and the working class has been liberated. Shouldn't we put our strength into it?' With this idea in mind, we can overcome any difficulties!"
    Fu Wenzhong, the hero of opening up ×× Gully and model of the security team, said: "... I have never been so happy even when I married my wife! ... When the Kuomintang was in power, they knew they were going to perish. They didn't mine coal under the sand, but dug wherever there was coal. When it rained, the riverbed was filled with water, and they mined coal in the riverbed. The terrain moved, and cracks let in water, and three large floods flooded ×× Gully ... Later, it caught fire again. At that time, I only cared about stealing coal to sell, and the people also stole. The fire burned the power lines, and they blocked it with cement. The Kuomintang officials, being country bumpkins, didn't understand and didn't even bother to ask, leaving it for three or four years.
    In November 1948, the People's Liberation Army came and said they wanted to produce coal ... But there was fire on top of the water, and methane gas on top of the fire. They drilled a hole to try, and there was a whooshing sound inside, with 9.5% methane gas and a temperature of 40 to 49 degrees... According to the regulations of the security section, it was impossible to open it. I thought: 'The mine is ours, it's not enough to just talk, we must do it to prove it ... I led four or five people in, sealing one layer of cave with cement, fearing that the gas would get in. But everyone always carries some gas on their body, and even a little gas is dangerous. We didn't use iron shovels, but copper hammers. We didn't speak, only used hand gestures. We didn't let any wind in. Suddenly, a worker took a breath, and the wooden clip on his mouth fell off, and he immediately fainted. With great difficulty, we carried him out of the cave and revived him with a resuscitator. His mouth and nose were bleeding, and his face was roasted purple and swollen by the gas ... In one section, the temperature inside was as high as 72 degrees, and the coal was roasted to a stinky oil. A 7-meter-long top collapsed, and the temperature increased to 81 degrees, with a slope of 50. Everyone's hands blistered after five minutes and could not continue. We immediately held a meeting to discuss solutions. We carried ice and water back down, dipping ourselves in water when we got burned, and transported the coal that was gushing oil from inside ... The temperature dropped, and the work could be done ...
    In June, we set a competition again. I asked everyone, 'Can we compete?' Everyone answered me, 'Why not? We can!' I asked again, 'If we can, how do we do it?' 'Just compete with each other day and night.' I asked again, 'Is there labor discipline?' 'It's already been set.' 'Who will guard it?' 'Everyone will guard it.' At this time, I rushed to say, 'I'll guard it! I'm good at criticizing people, I'll guard it first!' We work every day and discuss every day.
    We produced coal to supply Anshan Iron and Steel, to make airplanes and cannons, and to liberate all of China. Our workers must share the glory with our People's Liberation Army!"
    Han Shaojiang, the representative of the carpentry commando team, said: "... It's more uncomfortable than being beaten if we don't get the glory flag! At that time, four of us were working in the well, and two of them had their heads smashed open, leaving only two of us. Each piece of wood weighed more than 100 kilograms, and the place was small and we couldn't turn around, and there was half a person's depth of water under our feet. The two of us discussed: "Okay, we'll fall here if we fall, and we'll show our faces here if we show our faces."
    The next day, the two of us went to work very early to catch up. There were only two of us left, and we were afraid that we wouldn't be able to complete the task. Who knew that the two who were injured had the same idea as us. They thought that their heads were broken yesterday and delayed the work, so they had to hurry up. When we went down, they had already carried the wedges and were waiting for us, they were really good! We had only started working for five minutes when the stones started creaking. Think about it! If 96,000 cubic meters of water rushed over, we wouldn't be able to fly away! The guys said to the stones: "Still being idle? Still ringing! In less than three days, we'll finish you!" But the stones are alive, they bumped into each other, and they bumped into each other, constantly. We said: "What's going on? If you want to come down, we few young men will hold you up with our heads!" But if the stones fell, the whole well would be lost! We thought: Would that be worthy of the mine? Would that be worthy of the comrades in the mine? So we can't let it fall down!"
    When it was time, it would take another forty minutes to finish this place. We said: "Come on, otherwise if it collapses tomorrow, won't we be responsible?"
    "That's right! Come on! What we add is still our own!"
    "That's right! If it was the Kuomintang, I wouldn't do it even if they paid me!"
    "Collapse! Collapse his mother! We have to fix you today!"
    But the top is not afraid of being high, but his mother is only half high, and we can't straighten our backs!
    We completed it in seven days, saving ninety-two workdays. Isn't it our own if we waste it? No matter what, as long as the mine produces coal!"
    This meeting gave us all a lesson. It's a pity that I can't write down all their words. In half a day, our thinking changed greatly. We thought, if art workers don't rely on workers, where will the creation come from? When the heroic models on the stage called on us to go down to the factory, many people's hearts were pounding.
    "Comrades! We're coming!" everyone said in their hearts.

　　矿山两日
    安娥
    因为我们的动作迟缓了半个钟头，把给我们调度好了的行车程序搞乱了，两个钟头的路程，走了五个钟头。
    天完全黑了，雨不大也不小。矿局和市府全部人员正忙着这几天的劳模庆功大会。下车后，我们上了两部载客汽车，到了市内一个干部宿舍。这是才由房子主人为我们腾出来的两间大屋，男女同志各一。
    张秘书长来了，一开口道了一连串的歉，说另外在预备房子，先要我们去吃饭。张秘书长完全是最普通的人，不惹任何人的注意。要不是临走的那天，他给我们做了个短短的报告，便会永远不认识这位钢铁般的老干部！
    吃过饭，我们被引进一个旅馆，样子比上海香港的还要好，可是屋里的家具设备，被国民党军官老爷们糟塌得够瞧好半天。
    　　　×　　　　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　　　　　×
    今天的程序，上午，参观露天矿，下午参观竖井。
    在露天矿坑口等轻便车的时候，恰巧遇着下班的工人，就和他们闲谈起来。他们什么都觉得好。吃的问题也好，穿的问题也好，工资问题也好，医药卫生问题也好，子女读书问题也好，自己的学习问题也好，样样都好。毛主席，共产党，新民主主义，社会主义，苏联老大哥，更好。谈到有些目下还不够要求的地方，他们就说：
    “不大离。反正只要提高技术，增加生产，提高质量，矿山全部恢复了，反动派全部消灭了，矿山再发展下山，不几年就都好了。……这会儿有了苏联老大哥的经验和帮助，更快！现在我们采煤，老早就不用炸药崩了。上级说那太危险，对我们工人生命安全没有保障。改用镐子，可是那太慢啊，我们心里直着急。这会儿我们东北和苏联的贸易协定定好了，新的采煤机要来了，产量又大又安全，那有多好！”
    他们的话，说得那么安详，那么有把握，表现出主人的风度。使我们觉得惭愧。“我们原来落在你们后边这么一大截嘛！”我们心里这么说。
    不过他们言谈的表情，并不如想象中的“活跃”。比起知识分子，尤其搞戏的人来说，显得平淡。这我们才明白：“为什么我们演工人，尽管努力，表情‘深刻’，总是不象。”今天我们看见了，他们的“深刻”，“活跃”，不在日常生活的外形上。只有当他们站在机器前面，便显出他们的本色，个个生龙活虎，聪明、敏捷、坚定……。
    谈话给了我们一个结论：工人对集体利益，看得高过一切。一切为集体利益，不怕埋没个人功劳。在哈尔滨，在长春，在沈阳，都一样。不怪安钢曾经发生过一次闹鬼的哄传，那是在竞赛中，某小组的两个工人，每夜偷着留厂赶工。因此每晚放工时停在地面的加料车，第二天早晨上班时总悬在炉顶。——没有鬼，他自己怎么回上去的？”厂里闹鬼的话传开了。
    干部半夜里偷着守在大炉旁边，才把他们两个查住。第二天他们向工人说明经过，鬼就不闹了。现在各厂警卫不但要防火防特，还得防放工时偷着藏在厂中角落里的工人，生怕要影响他们的健康。
    轻便车来了，我们一组第一批上车。明明是向下走，却觉得腾云驾雾。据说这还是特别为我们这些知识分子开慢车的。
    那个滋味不坏，可惜我怕风，藏在人堆中间，不能领略全貌，只在人缝里看到一些。
    下了车，我们坐在煤上等第二批到来。又同工人聊开了。得到的印象依旧是：明朗、坚定、虚心，大处着眼。他们一致说，帝国主义和他们的狗是不值钱的，他们一定会被消灭！新社会一定会实现。他们简直象一个人似的，只能分别他们的声音面貌，不能分别他们的思想意识。
    “我们觉得这地方真好看，你们也觉得这地方好看吗？”我们问。
    “怎么会不好呢？那么些电线杆子不象大树林子吗？我们工人就是种树的。这么大矿山，这么多机器，这么多煤归我们照顾。”
    “敌伪，国民党时期，你们怎么想呢？”
    “那会儿，光想吃饭还来不及呢！橡子面吃得人拉不出屎来，饿得两眼直发花，还有心思想这些！就只想法子偷点煤拿回去卖几个钱花。……同志们，你们这是从哪儿来呀？”
    “北京。”
    “北京啊！唐山矿也搞得不大离了，你们看过了吗？”
    “先看你们这里。”
    “管那儿一样，不过先解放的地方总比较便宜点儿。反正迟早都会搞得好的。话是这么说：有毛主席和共产党领导着，他怎么会搞不好呢。快！不要几年（儿）就行！”
    第二批人来了，我们到坑底去参观。上来后大家很兴奋。
    下午参观竖井，没下去，因为我们有多少人下去，就得多少人保护我们，这太耽误生产。据说就下那趟空心电梯，身体坏点的都难吃得住，尤其我们文学组，老弱妇女还是实事求是的好。在上边看了阵机器，已经够兴奋的。有一个部分，那么一大屋子机器，只一个工人掌握，好不神气！
    本来晚上有京戏看，可是谁也不想看那咿咿呀呀的了，因为想起来，它和白天的内容力量太不调合，情绪上没法转过来。
    　　　×　　　　　×　　　　　×　　　　　　×　　　　　　×
    第二天很早我们就跑下花园去了。照相机到处卡卡的响着。歌声响起来，我们这“沉默”参观团，从进了工业区就有了声音。“刘胡兰”里的一只歌成了我们的团歌，“你是灯塔”“解放区的天”“没有共产党，就没有中国”“东方红”“国际歌”……一只接一一只……
    我们走进劳模庆功大会场，特等模范们戴着大红花，坐在会场中间前几排，集体模范和模范们也戴着红花，坐了满满一会场。我们被招待在右边的前几排。特模们客气地不断给我们送烟，送茶……，唉！比打我们还不好受！那种伟大诚恳的主人气派，把我们弄得慌张了！
    “别这样好吧？同志！受不了啊！”我们心里说，差点儿要喊出来。大家互相望了望，惭愧压住我们的心！
    这个会昨天已经开了一天，特等模范张子富的报告已经过去，后悔昨天没有来。
    今天我们一共听了五个特等模范的报告。
    他们的发言，坦白，自然，说得好就好，不好就不好，丝毫不挂在心上，只要能把内容传达出来就得。他们述说着自己的工作，说着说着非常得意，丝毫不隐瞒心里的喜悦，这是我们小资产阶级所不敢作的。记得有一回自编自演“二毛立功”的船厂工人王水亭，当说到他的作品得奖时，便乐得他哈哈的大笑，话都说不完了。他们一切都是为阶级利益，因此他们得意，他们敢说，主要的，他们敢做！
    特模朱英述说他的修矿工作：“去年矿冒了顶，正在咽喉路上，我感到责任重大……我们十八个人担任了这个工作，上级担心我们说：“石头会掉下来！”我说：“我保证掉下来也有办法！”可是顶，通了又冒，冒了又通。我见了石头就怕，只要有一块下来，顶就全垮。地方窄，大家只能偏着身子翻出翻进。真的一块二吨大的石头掉下来，离我有六米，果然顶垮了。
    坑里热得吐不过气，老得用冷水喷，喷得浑身直打战，……我没有特殊能耐，只有勇敢，凡事在头里干，起带头作用。
    如今党是个大灯笼，照亮我们的前途，希望每个人都要比我更好，都在我以上，……今天这个会是我这一辈子最大的光荣。”
    木匠沈国春说：“……上级给我任务要我九个月完成，我说：‘行’！后来上级见我工作快，又要我提早完成。我说：‘行’！工作中凡是别的木匠组犯愁的活，我就说：‘行。你们干不了，我们来’。上级见我们做的快，又说：‘加把劲儿！夺胜利旗哟’！我们说：‘好呗！我们指定要夺！还要一直夺下去！永远保住它！不让别组夺得去！’
    我大话吹出去了，净我一个人加油也干不了，我得动员大伙儿……
    我们边干边加劲学习，提高政治觉悟。我们觉悟到，新民主主义社会跟小日本和国民党旧社会不同，我们不但要把新民主主义社会搞好，还要走到社会主义社会。我们大伙寻思着：‘不但我们这一个辈子好，后代人更会好，共产党来了，箱子里米没空过，工人阶级可解放了。还不把劲使出来吗？’我们抱着这么个思想，什么困难都克服得了！”
    保安队模范——打开××沟的英雄富文忠说：“……我娶媳妇也没象今天这么高兴过！……国民党在时，知道他们要灭亡，他们采煤不下沙，哪儿有煤哪儿挖，下雨河身积了水，就在河底采煤。地形动了，裂缝流进水，三条大水淹了××沟……后来又着了火，我那会儿只管偷煤卖，百姓们也偷。火烧了电线，用洋灰堵了个死。国民党大员们，土包子不懂，也不来过问，一搁三四年。
    一九四八，十一月解放军来，说要出煤……但水上头是火，火上头是瓦斯，钻了个眼试试看，里头喔喔的响，有９．５％的瓦斯，四十到四十九度的温度……按保安科的规程无法打开。我就想了：‘矿山是我们的，光说嘴不行，必须作出来才能证明……我领了四五个人进去，进一层洞，用洋灰封一层，怕养气进去。可是得个人身上总都带点养气，有一点养气就有危险。我们不用铁锨，用铜锤。我们不开口，只做手势。一点风不给他进来。忽然一个工友，一吸气，嘴上的夹木掉了，立刻晕倒。好容易抬出洞口，用苏醒器救活过来。口、鼻子都流血，脸给瓦斯烤得又紫又肿……有一段里边的温度有七十二度高，煤炭被烤得流臭油。冒了七公尺大顶，温度增到八十一，坡度五十。每人的手做五分钟就起了泡，没法再做下去。我们即刻开会讨论，想办法。背冰和水再下去，烫了就沾水，从里边运出来了呼呼冒着油的煤炭……温度降低了，工作能做了……
    六月间我们又定竞赛书，我问大伙：‘能不能竞赛？’大伙回答我：‘怎么不能呢？能！’我又问：‘能，怎么做呢？’‘日夜的互相竞赛就得了呗。’我再问：‘有劳动纪律吗？’‘已经定好了哇。’‘谁守啊？’‘大伙儿守呗。’这时候我就抢着说：‘我守！我好批评人，我先守！’我们每天工作，每天讨论。
    我们生产了煤供给安钢，做飞机大炮，解放全中国，我们工人要和我们的解放军同受光荣！”
    木匠突击队代表汉少疆说：“……得不到光荣旗，比打一顿还难受！当时我们四人在井里工作，两人的头部被石头打开了花，只剩了两个人。每根木头都在一百公斤以上，地方又小转不过身，脚下还有半人深的水。我们两人就讨论：“好吧，我们垮台也垮在这块地方，露脸也露在这块地方”。
    第二天我们两人很早就去上班赶活。只剩了两个人怕不赶完成不了任务。谁知道他们受伤的两个，跟我们的想法一样。认为昨天头打破了耽误了工，不赶不行。当我们下去的时候，他们已经抬完了楔子等着我们，真是好样的！我们才动手了五分钟，石头就轧轧的响起来。想啊！九万六千方米的水，要是冲过来，飞也飞不了呀！伙计们就向石头说：“还闹闲？还响哩！过不了三天，就完成你！”可是石头是活的，它碰它，它碰它，一个劲的直碰。我们就说：“闹什么邪？你要下来，我们几个小伙子，使头顶也顶住你呀！”不过万一石头落下来，整个井就丢了！我们想：这还对得起矿山？对得起矿山的同志们吗？所以我们怎么也不能让它掉下来呀！
    到点了，要做完这块地方还得四十分钟。我们说：“加油呀，不然明天要是冒了，还不是我们负责？”
    “对呀！加油呀！加点！加的还不是我们自己的吗？”
    “对呀！要是国民党，加钱老子也不干呀！”
    “冒顶！冒他妈的！今天非把你整好不行！”
    可是顶高不怕他高，他妈的偏偏半截高，直不起腰来！
    我们七天就把它完成了，省了九十二个工，浪费了还不是我们自己的？我们不管怎么，只要矿井出煤！”
    这个会给我们大伙儿上了一课。可惜我不能把他们的话全部都写出来。半天的工夫，我们思想上起了很大变化。我们想，艺术工作者不依靠工人，从哪儿来的创作？当台上的英雄模范们号召我们下厂时，许多人心里嘣嘣的跳。
    “同志！我们要来的！”我们每一个人心里都这样说。
