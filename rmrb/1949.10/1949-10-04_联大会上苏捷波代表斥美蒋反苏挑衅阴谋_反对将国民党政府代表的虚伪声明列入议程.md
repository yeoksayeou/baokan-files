Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 3rd: According to a TASS dispatch from New York on the 1st, the UN General Assembly plenary meeting discussed on September 29th the issue of including the Kuomintang government's provocative statement on the "threat" to China's independence, territorial integrity, and peace in the Far East on the agenda.

The purpose of submitting this slanderous trick of the Kuomintang government representative for discussion at the UN General Assembly is to create an anti-Soviet provocative clamor and to conceal the true reasons for the collapse of the Kuomintang clique from world public opinion. The authors of this Kuomintang trick and their American masters are carrying out this conspiracy largely in an attempt to stir up an atmosphere of war hysteria in the region by falsely fabricating a "threat" to peace in the Far East, thereby facilitating their plans to establish a new aggressive Pacific group.

As in the Steering Committee, the Kuomintang government representative, Jiang Tingfu, again failed to present any facts or reasons that could somewhat prove that the UN General Assembly had reason to consider this provocative accusation. Jiang Tingfu spoke in detail about the friendship between the Kuomintang government and the United States and declared that the Soviet Union gave "spiritual and material" support to the Chinese People's Liberation Movement. The Kuomintang representative also claimed that the Soviet authorities prevented the Chinese authorities from using Dalian, and that the Soviet Union violated the 1945 Sino-Soviet Treaty.

　　联大会上苏捷波代表斥美蒋反苏挑衅阴谋
    反对将国民党政府代表的虚伪声明列入议程
    【新华社北京三日电】据塔斯社纽约一日讯：联合国大会全体会议于九月二十九日讨论将国民党政府关于对中国独立与领土完整及远东和平之“威胁”的挑衅声明列入议程的问题。
    国民党政府代表的这一毁谤的诡计之提交联合国大会讨论，其目的在于造成反苏挑衅的叫嚣，并向世界公众隐瞒国民党集团崩溃的真正原因。国民党这一诡计的作者及其美国主子之所以进行这一阴谋，也大部由于力图假借捏造的对远东和平的“威胁”，来在这个地区掀起战争歇斯底里的气氛，借此便利他们实现其建立新的侵略性的太平洋集团的计划。
    和在指导委员会上一样，国民党政府的代表蒋廷黻，这次又没有提出任何可以多少证明联合国大会有理由考虑这一挑衅控诉的事实或理由。蒋廷黻详细地谈到国民党政府与美国的友谊，并宣称苏联予中国人民解放运动“以精神上和物质上的”支持。国民党代表又声言，苏联当局妨碍中国当局使用大连，苏联违反一九四五年的中苏条约。
