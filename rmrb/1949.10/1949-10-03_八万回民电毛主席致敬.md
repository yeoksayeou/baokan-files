　　80,000 Hui People
   　Send Telegram to Chairman Mao to Express Respect
    [Another Dispatch] The full text of the congratulatory telegram from all circles of the Hui people in Beijing to Chairman Mao during the celebration of the founding of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China is as follows: Respected Chairman Mao:
    We, the 80,000 Hui people of Beijing, celebrate the birth of the People's Republic of China and the establishment of the Central People's Government with infinite excitement and joy. The birth of the new China marks that all ethnic groups will gain equality and freedom throughout the country. This is the goal that our Hui people have been striving for for hundreds of years, and now it has been achieved thanks to your wise leadership, the correct ethnic policies of the Chinese Communist Party, and the heroic battles of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. We deeply understand that without the Chinese Communist Party and without you, there would be no common unity of all ethnic groups, and there would be no liberation of the Hui people. Therefore, on the occasion of celebrating the founding ceremony, we pay our highest respects to you, and pay our respects to Commander-in-Chief Zhu and all the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. We guarantee: we will wholeheartedly support the Central People's Government, overcome narrow nationalist tendencies, strengthen the unity of fraternal ethnic groups in the country, and advance side by side with people of all ethnic groups to build a new China.

   　电毛主席致敬
    【又讯】北京市各界回民庆祝中华人民共和国中央人民政府成立大会向毛主席致敬电全文如下：敬爱的毛主席：
    我们北京市八万回民以无限兴奋愉快的心情庆祝中华人民共和国的诞生和中央人民政府的成立。新中国的诞生标志着各族人民即将在全国范围内获得平等与自由。这是我们回族人民几百年来不断斗争所争取的目标，现在由于你的英明领导，中国共产党正确的民族政策和中国人民解放军的英勇作战而获得实现了。我们深切的了解，在没有中国共产党没有你以前，就没有过各族人民的共同团结，也就不会有回民的解放。所以当此庆祝开国盛典的时候，我们向你致崇高的敬礼，向朱总司令及人民解放军全体将士致敬。我们保证：竭诚拥护中央人民政府，克服狭隘的民族主义倾向，加强国内兄弟民族的团结，和各民族人民并肩前进，为建设新中国而奋斗。
