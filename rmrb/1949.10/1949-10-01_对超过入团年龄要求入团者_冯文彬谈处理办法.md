Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 29th. Since the establishment of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League in various regions, it has not only been warmly supported by the broad masses of young people who actively seek to join, but also some people over the age limit for membership (actual age 25) have applied to join. Because the local Youth League committees have no stipulations in the League Constitution regarding this point, they are not able to handle it without authorization. Therefore, a reporter from China Youth Press inquired with Feng Wenbin, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Youth League, who provided the following answers: "We welcome the vast number of young people who enthusiastically request to join or participate in the Youth League, but joining the Youth League should have age restrictions according to the League Constitution. Otherwise, if people in their thirties, forties, fifties, or sixties all join, then the Youth League will no longer be a youth organization. For those over the age of 25 who wish to join, the following three methods can be used: (1) Welcome them to participate in the work and activities of the League, but not to join the organization, as friends of the Youth League. (2) If they are urgently required to join the League organization and genuinely meet the conditions for membership, they may also be admitted; however, according to the League Constitution, they only have the right to speak and be elected, and only have the right to elect and vote when elected to leadership organs. (3) Comrades who are indeed at the level of League members but have not been admitted due to age, if they encounter situations such as work transfers, the Youth League of the original affiliated agency or organization may provide written proof that the comrade does indeed meet the conditions for membership but has not been admitted due to exceeding the age limit, so that the new agency or organization can have a more accurate understanding of him politically."

　　对超过入团年龄要求入团者
  　 冯文彬谈处理办法
    【新华社北京二十九日电】中国新民主主义青年团开始在各地建团以来，不但受到广大青年的热烈拥护，积极要求入团；而且有些超过入团年龄（实际年龄二十五岁）的人，也要求参加。各地团委因为团章对于这一点没有规定，不便擅自处理。中国青年社记者为此特向青年团中央书记冯文彬询问，承解答如下：“对于广大青年群众纷纷要求或参加青年团，我们很欢迎，但是参加青年团，依照团章应有年龄的限制，否则三四十岁或五六十岁的人都参加了，那么青年团就不成其为青年的组织了。对于超过二十五岁的要求入团的人，可以按下列三个办法处理：（一）欢迎他们参加团的工作和活动，但不参加组织，作为青年团的团友。（二）如有迫切要求参加团的组织，并且确实具备入团条件的，也可吸收入团；但必须按团章规定，仅有发言权和被选举权，只有在被选入领导机关时，才有选举权和表决权。（三）确够团员水平，仅仅因为年龄关系未能吸收入团的同志，如果遇到工作调动一类的情形，可由原来所属机关团体中的青年团，以书面证明该同志确具入团条件，仅因年龄超过，未能吸收入团，以便新的机关或团体，对他在政治上能有比较正确的了解。”
