    [Zhangjiakou Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper at 12:00 Midnight on the 28th] This reporter had an exclusive interview with Chairman Zhang Su, who had just returned from Northern Chahar, on the afternoon of the 28th. According to him: (1) Plague Situation: In Chahan Bengbeng Village, Chahar League, 24 residents died consecutively, with the last death occurring on October 19th. The time of the outbreak there has not yet been determined. This plague then spread to Longwangmiao Village, Kangbao County, where four people died before October 20th, and one person died later. One person died in Anjiagou Village in the county, confirmed as plague; two people died in Mujia Gou Village, Baoyuan County, and one person died in Wenjiaying Village, not yet determined whether it was plague. In Beishacheng Village, 60 li north of Kangbao County, a family of seven contracted the plague and all died within three or four days. A small merchant from Inner Mongolia died near Kangbao City. The bodies of the above deceased were not cremated. It is difficult to ascertain how many villages in Northern Chahar have experienced the plague and how many people have died, because the villagers are afraid of burning corpses and mostly conceal the information and bury them secretly, which adds great difficulty to the epidemic eradication work. Residents should be mobilized to report. (2) Epidemic Prevention Situation: The Zhangbei Special District has established a general headquarters for epidemic prevention, and the counties have successively established epidemic prevention headquarters. Two lines of defense have now been established: the first line of defense is along the border between the Zhangbei Special District and Inner Mongolia, and the second line of defense is the Outer Great Wall. The North China Epidemic Prevention Department of the Central Military Commission and the Health Department of the Chahar Provincial Military Region have jointly formed a 20-person epidemic prevention team, carrying radio stations and vaccines, and rushed to Zhangbei. They departed for the epidemic area on the 27th and are conducting north-south patrols along the Tong-Kangbao line with Zhangbei City as the center.
    Chairman Zhang Su made a special trip to Zhangbei County on the 25th and convened a meeting of 200 special and county-level cadres to convey the resolutions of the Provincial Party Committee. Chairman Zhang first explained the seriousness of the plague and called on the Party, government, army, and people to "immediately mobilize, treat it as a combat mission, and eradicate the plague on the spot!" He emphasized the following points: A. Isolate from the epidemic area, and traffic must be more strictly sealed off. B. To eradicate germs, anyone who dies of the plague must be burned. C. Epidemic and non-epidemic areas should launch a cleaning and sanitation campaign to widely eliminate the vectors of germs – rats and fleas. D. In areas where the plague may occur, strictly check the dead and sick. If it occurs in any village, seal off that village; if it occurs in any household, seal off that household, adopt village-to-village blockades, guard posts, and sentry posts. Except for epidemic prevention personnel, no one is allowed to enter or leave.

　　察省张苏主席亲赴察北　
    号召把鼠疫就地歼灭            
    返张家口后对本报记者谈察北疫情
    吕光明
    【本报二十八日晚十二时张家口专电】记者于二十八日午后专访甫从察北归来之张苏主席，据谈：（一）鼠疫情况：察盟察汉崩崩村居民连续死亡二十四人，最后死者是在十月十九日。该地何时发生，尚未查明。此项鼠疫后蔓延到康保县龙王庙村，十月二十日前死四人，后死一人。该县安家沟死一人，确系鼠疫；宝源县木家沟死二人，温家营死一人，尚未判明是否鼠疫。距康保县城北六十里地的北沙城村一家七口患鼠疫，三、四日内全体死亡。从内蒙来一小商死于康保城附近。以上死者尸体均未能烧掉。至察北有多少个村子发生鼠疫，死多少人，很难查清，原因是老乡怕烧尸体，多隐瞒不报便偷偷埋掉，这给灭疫工作增加很大困难，应发动居民检举。（二）防疫情况：张北专区成立了防疫总指挥部，各县相继成立了防疫指挥部。现已建立两道封锁线：察北专区沿内蒙交界处为第一道封锁线，外长城为第二道封锁线。中央军委华北防疫处、察省军区卫生部联合组成二十个人的防疫队，携电台、疫苗赶赴张北后，二十七日出发疫区，并以张北城为中心，在通康保一线上做南北巡查。
    张苏主席系于二十五日专程抵张北县城，召开了二百人的专、县干部会议，传达省委决议。张主席首先说明鼠疫的严重性，号召党政军民“紧急动员起来，当作战斗任务，把鼠疫就地歼灭！”并强调做到下列几点：甲、与疫区绝缘，要更加严密地封锁交通。乙、为根绝疫菌，凡患鼠疫病死者，一定要烧掉。丙、疫区非疫区均展开清洁卫生运动，广泛地消灭疫菌媒介——老鼠、跳蚤。丁、可能发生鼠疫的地区，严格检查死人、病人，哪村发生封锁哪村，哪户发生封锁哪户，采取村村封锁、站岗放哨、除防疫工作人员外，禁止任何人出入。
