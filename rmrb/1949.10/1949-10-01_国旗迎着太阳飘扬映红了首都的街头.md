National Flags Flutter in the Sun, Reddening the Streets of the Capital

September 30th, the day before the grand celebration, the streets of Beijing, facing the sun, were a sea of red. Many doorways displayed one, two, or even five red flags, fluttering in the sky with the wind. Various government offices, factories, schools, and even the staff, workers, and students of Peking Union Medical College, all creatively erected vibrant red arches and wrote huge slogans: "Celebrate the Birth of New China," "Long Live the People's Republic of China," "Long Live the Central People's Government!"... and hung red star lanterns of all sizes. Many people riding bicycles, pedicabs, trams, and cars were rushing home with red star lanterns, eager to hang them up as soon as possible. Small red flags fluttered on the front of vehicles, adding to the sense of urgency. Mounting shops had been working day and night for the past two days, yet they still couldn't meet the demand for lanterns. Consequently, various government offices, organizations, schools, and factories started making them themselves. The post office's slogan was that each of the six hundred employees participating in the grand celebration should have a lantern. The Pingjin Railway Bureau requested one lantern or torch for every two people. The 500 workers of the Huachang Shoe Store stayed up two nights to rush-produce lanterns. Workers in the glassware industry in the Twelfth District were making their own glass flower lanterns. Many workers in various industries were rushing to make new clothes, and many government personnel were buying leather shoes in preparation for participating in the founding ceremony. The street patrol members of each street had changed into new clothes and wore leather shoes, displaying an unprecedentedly neat appearance. Workers at the tram company named two newly built trams "People's Political Consultative Conference Commemorative" and "People's Republic of China Commemorative," and also fitted out four additional floats, one of which was decorated with an arc of twenty-eight red five-pointed star lights, commemorating the twenty-eighth anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party.

　　国旗迎着太阳飘扬映红了首都的街头
    九月三十日，盛典的前一日，北京的街头迎着太阳一片红，许多门前插起了一幅、两幅以至五幅的红旗，随风在空际飘扬。各机关、工厂、学校甚至协和医院的职员工人与学生，都自出心裁地扎了鲜红的彩门，写了巨幅的标语：“庆祝新中国的诞生”、“中华人民共和国万岁”、“中央人民政府万岁”……，挂了大大小小的红星灯笼。骑脚踏车的、坐三轮车、电车与汽车的，许多人都带着红星灯笼在往家跑，准备尽快挂出来。小红旗在车首飞舞，显得格外紧张。裱糊铺两日以来星夜赶做，仍不能供应灯笼的需要。于是，各机关团体学校工厂同样自己做起来。邮局的口号是参加盛典的六百职工，每人要有一个灯。平津铁路局要求每二人有一灯或一个火把。华昌鞋店五百工人为了赶做提灯，有两个通宵没有睡觉。十二区的料器业工人，在自制玻璃花灯。各业中许多工人在赶做新衣，许多机关人员在购买皮鞋，准备参加开国的盛典。各街道的纠察队员都换了新衣，穿了皮鞋，现出从来未有的整洁气象。电车公司工人将新造的两辆新车定名为“人民政协纪念号”、“中华人民共和国纪念号”，并另外装了四辆花车，其中一辆装了二十八颗红五星电灯叠成的弧形灯丛，纪念中国共产党二十八周岁。＊
