How Soviet Friends Help Chinese Female Workers Learn Technology

Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and with the help of Soviet international friends, women in the Luda area after liberation have demonstrated their active creativity and significant progress in political, economic, cultural, and social activities. Especially the women in production and construction are learning heavy industrial technology with great effort and have already shown good results.

From June 1948 to August 1949, for more than a year, under the cultivation of Soviet section chief Lisov, more than 40 female workers in the rolling stock section of the China Changchun Railway were distributed in lathes, electric brazing, electric welding, warehouses, chemical laboratories, light oil depots, boiler factories, rolling stock factories... working in various workshops. In addition, they also serve as drivers of light oil vehicles and carpenters, tinsmiths, etc. There are also female workers in the compressor room repairing locomotive accessories.

In order to help Chinese women learn locomotive driving technology, Section Chief Lisov began to recruit seven women to learn this work from the beginning of June this year. At first, he let them familiarize themselves with railway signals at each station of the locomotive, and then found model drivers to teach them practical skills. Section Chief Lisov also took the time to explain the structure of the locomotive to them, so that they could quickly combine theory and practice. Now, they have made preliminary achievements in railway transportation. By the time of the "March 8th" Women's Day next year, these seven female technicians will be able to fully master the locomotive and work as drivers and stokers. They will use their good results in studying technology as a gift to commemorate next year's "March 8th" festival. The female workers learning to drive locomotives said: In the past, during the Japanese rule, even male workers could not get on the locomotive. Not to mention learning technology, they would not even be allowed to stand on the locomotive for a while—let alone us women. When we first started working, the driver, stoker, and fireman were very concerned about us, afraid that we would fall off when standing at the door of the car when the car turned sharply, and afraid that we would be scalded by the boiler if we were not careful. They stood next to our driver's seat and carefully pointed out: what is this signal, what color of light does it show, how should it be carried out, how to pour oil, ... After get off work, the railway workers also asked us if we were tired from work, and if we were afraid of working on the car. Section Chief Lisov not only carefully cultivated them in their work, but also took care of some small things in their lives. He said: "It has never been heard of in the world that capitalist countries train female train drivers. Only the people's own country can truly train the children of the working people to master technology." This sentence not only revealed his internationalist love for the Chinese working people, but also shows that China has become a people's country today.

Technical teacher Vali of the China Changchun Railway Chemical Experiment Factory is a Soviet woman. At first, Vali and the female workers could not understand each other, and they had to use gestures to teach technology, but she still patiently taught by hand in various ways, and never showed any impatience. Once, during an experiment, the female workers made a mistake in the experimental medicine, and the result of the experiment was incorrect. They were a little flustered, fearing that Vali would blame them, but Vali was not angry, but encouraged them and said: "It doesn't matter, if it doesn't work once, we'll do it a second time." Another time, the female workers were learning to experiment with the firepower of oil and the amount of water and heat of coal. They accidentally broke the measuring scale. Vali hurried over to see if their hands had been cut by the glass. When the female workers were sick, Vali persuaded them to see a doctor, and brought porridge and tea from home for the patients to drink. After work, Vali often enthusiastically taught them Russian, and also told them stories about the liberation of Soviet women in various aspects. The female workers were very active in their work with her help, and their lives were also very happy. They often said: "If it weren't for the leadership of the Communist Party and the help of Soviet friends, not to mention women, even men would not be able to learn technology."

Guo Shuhua, a female comrade from the Luda Ship Canal Section, was originally a female worker who had never even seen design drawings for shipbuilding and engine manufacturing. Now, with the help of Section Chief Ivanov, she can draw drawings of water pumps and has become a good hand at drafting. Therefore, the Chinese and Soviet comrades in the design section call her the "future female engineer." Guo Shuhua said: "Only the socialist Soviet elder brother is willing to teach me technology so enthusiastically and train me to be an engineer. In the era of Japanese devils, let alone training you to be an engineer, you couldn't even touch being a 'tracing' assistant!"

This kind of thing is very common in Northeast China and Luda. It most powerfully illustrates the sincere and lofty love of the Soviet people for the Chinese working people, which is a concrete manifestation of internationalist spirit.

When the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression had just ended, the Kuomintang reactionaries clamored that the Soviet Union had forcibly occupied Dada, but today's facts increasingly prove that it was completely a shameless rumor and slander by the reactionaries.

Chairman Mao once instructed us in " On the People's Democratic Dictatorship": "Internationally, we belong to the anti-imperialist front headed by the Soviet Union. Genuine friendly assistance can only be found in this direction..." He also said that "the CPSU is our best teacher, and we must learn from the CPSU." We have a deeper understanding of Chairman Mao's instructions from practice. Only by getting close to the Soviet elder brother and humbly and diligently learning from them can we build a new China that is independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, and prosperous!

　　苏联朋友怎样帮助中国女工学习技术
    解放以后的旅大地区的妇女，在中国共产党的领导与苏联国际友人的帮助下，在政治、经济、文化和社会各种活动中都表现出了她们积极的创造性和显著的进步；特别是在生产建设中的妇女们，正以高度的努力来学习重工业的技术，而且已经表现出了很好的成绩。
    从一九四八年六月到一九四九年八月的一年多的时间中，中长铁路机务段的女工在苏联籍段长李索夫的培养下，有四十多名女工分布在旋盘、烤电火、烧电火、仓库、化学实验、轻油车库、锅炉厂、对车厂……各个工作间里工作，此外，她们还担任轻油车的司机和木匠、洋铁匠等工作，压缩机室里也有女工在修理机车附属品。
    为了帮助中国妇女学习开机车的技术，李索夫段长从今年六月初开始，前后吸收了七个妇女学习这项工作；起初让她们熟悉机车各站铁路信号，然后找模范司机教给她们实际技术。李索夫段长还抽功夫给她们讲机车构造，让她们很快的把理论和实际结合起来。现在，她们已经在铁路运输上有了初步的成就，到明年“三八”妇女节的时候，这七名女技士就可以完全掌握机车，做司机和司炉等工作了，她们要以努力学习技术的良好成绩，作为纪念明年“三八”节的献礼。学习开机车的女工说：从前在日本统治时代，就是男工也捞不着到机车上来，别说学技术，就连在机车上站一会也都不让——更别说我们妇女了。我们第一天开始工作的时候，司机、司炉、火夫都非常关心我们，怕我们站在车门口，车子拐大弯的时候摔下去，又怕不小心给锅炉烫着。他们站在我们的司机座旁边细心的指点：这是什么信号，显示什么颜色的灯光，应该怎样进行，怎样浇油，……下班以后，铁路工人还问我们干活累不累，在车上干活怕不怕，李索夫段长不仅在工作中细心培养她们，并且连生活上的一些小事情都照顾到了。他说：“在世界上没有听说过资本主义国家培养女火车司机，只有人民自己的国家才能真正培养劳动人民的儿女掌握技术。”这句话，不仅流露了他对于中国劳动人民的国际主义的友爱，同时也说明中国今天已经成为一个人民的国家了。
    中长段化学试验厂的技术教师娃丽是个苏联妇女，起初娃丽和女工们讲话不懂，教授技术的时候只得用手势比划，但是她仍然耐心的用各种方法把着手教，从来也没有表现过一点不耐烦的神情。有一次做试验，女工们把试验药品弄错了，试验的结果不对头，心里有点慌起来了，深怕娃丽责备她们，可是娃丽不但没有生气，反而鼓励她们说：“没关系，一次不成再来第二次。”又有一次，女工们学习试验油的火力和煤的水量与热度，一个不小心把度尺打破了，娃丽急忙跑过来看她们的手，是不是让玻璃割破了。当女工们病了的时候，娃丽劝她们去看病，并且从家里拿来稀粥和茶给病人喝。每当工作完了以后，娃丽常常热心的教她们俄语，还把苏联妇女们在各方面得到解放的故事讲给她们听，女工们在她的帮助下工作都很积极，生活也非常愉快。她们常说：“如果不是共产党的领导和苏联朋友的帮助，别说妇女，就连男人也别想学到技术。”
    旅大船渠科的女同志郭淑华，原来是个对设计造船造机图样连看都没有看见过的女工，现在在科长依万诺夫的帮助下，能画出抽水机的模图，成为制图的好手了，因此，设计科的中国同志和苏联同志都称呼她是“未来女工程师”。郭淑华说：“只有社会主义的苏联老大哥才肯这样热诚的教给我技术，培养我作工程师，要在日寇时代，别说培养你作工程师，就连当个‘描图’助手也摸不着啊”！
    这一类的事情在东北在旅大是很多的，它最有力地说明了苏联人民对中国劳动人民的真诚而崇高的友爱，也就是国际主义精神的具休表现。
    抗战刚刚结束的时候，国民党反动派叫嚣苏联强占施大，而今天的事实日益证明了那完全是反动派的无耻造谣诬蔑。
    毛主席在“论人民民主专政”中就曾经指示我们说：“我们在国际上是属于以苏联为首的反帝国主义战线一方面的，真正的友谊的援助只能向这方面去找……”又说“联共就是我们的最好的先生，我们必须向联共学习”。我们从实际中更深刻的体会了毛主席对我们的指示。我们只有和苏联老大哥接近，虚心的努力的向他们学习，才能建设成一个独立、民主、和平、统一和富强的新中国！
