    【北京讯】国立回民学院六日在该院礼堂举行成立典礼。到有该院师生及来宾高教会张宗麟秘书长、市政府代表佘涤清、市青委代表姚亦沙、人民政协少数民族代表刘格平、吴鸿宾、张冲、天宝、王国兴、金汉文、杨静仁、白寿彝、多杰才旦等共千余人。会议于下午三时半开始，首由该院马院长玉槐致开会词，他指出回民学院的成立标志着我回族人民的光辉地位，并显示出回民及各族人民的团结。这也指明了中国的少数民族只有在马列主义的旗帜下，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，才能得到解放。接着他说明了回民学院的教育方针与教育目的。
    高教会张秘书长在讲话中，除对回民学院的成立表示祝贺外，并且根据中国人民政协共同纲领中所规定的民族政策，说明了发展回民教育的原则。市政府代表佘涤清、市青委代表姚亦沙讲话中表示愿尽一切可能帮助回民学院发展，并勉励同学努力学习。人民政协少数民族代表刘格平等相继致词，一致认为没有中国共产党、毛主席的领导，决没有少数民族的解放。回民学院的成立不仅是回民的，而且也是各少数民族的文化建设的开始，我们一定要紧密团结，携手并进，迎接新中国文化建设的高潮。最后由该院教职员、学生、工友代表致词，他们一致表示：愿在毛泽东旗帜下，加紧学习，为建设回民学院而努力。
