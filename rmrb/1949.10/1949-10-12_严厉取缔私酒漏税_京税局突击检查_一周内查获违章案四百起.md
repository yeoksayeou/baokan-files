　　Strictly Ban Private Liquor and Tax Evasion
    Beijing Tax Bureau Conducts Surprise Inspections
    Uncovers 400 Violation Cases in One Week
    [This City News] Since mid-September, the Beijing Tax Bureau has launched surprise inspections on private liquor, stamp tax, and business tax, achieving considerable results. In the first week of work, as many as 407 violation cases of various sizes were uncovered, including 1769.5 jin and 10 pounds of alcohol, 2976 jin of private liquor, and over 500 jars of imitation Shaoxing wine. This has not only greatly educated illegal merchants but also protected national financial income. After this inspection, the sales volume of the city's liquor monopoly company has increased from less than 20,000 jin per day to around 30,000 jin.
    　　　　Experience: Start with Small Matters, Timely Trace to the Root
    The government explicitly banned the private brewing of local wine and beer in April. However, judging from the daily sales volume of the liquor monopoly company, private liquor still exists in large quantities. In the past, Beijing consumed about 30,000 to 40,000 jin of liquor per day, while the liquor company's daily sales volume in August never exceeded 15,000 jin. This fact shows that private liquor has gone "underground." According to investigations, most of the prevalent private liquor is made by diluting alcohol with water; the methods of hiding it are even more varied. The rampant private liquor has caused great damage to national financial revenue. If the market circulation of private liquor is estimated at 20,000 jin per day, the country's monthly loss would be as high as 400 million yuan, accounting for about one-third of the city's total income. Therefore, in addition to regular comprehensive inspections, it is very necessary to conduct a focused inspection.
    Under the unified leadership of the Municipal Tax Bureau, the inspection work was carried out simultaneously by various tax sub-bureaus in their respective jurisdictions on September 15. In advance, the Investigation Section of the Municipal Tax Bureau convened cadres participating in the work on the 13th to report on the purpose and work arrangements of the inspection, so that cadres could truly recognize in their minds that this work is fighting to protect state property and is very important. The sub-bureaus then divided the participating cadres into groups of two or three on the 14th and held discussion meetings to discuss the specific inspection methods and approaches during the work, based on the actual situation in the region. In general, the method of dividing the area of responsibility by groups with mutual contact was adopted. In terms of the allocation of work cadres, 20 people from the Municipal Tax Bureau and 26 people from the Liquor Company were dispatched to participate, together with cadres from various sub-bureaus, totaling nearly 200 people.
    Because most of the large liquor merchants had undergone a surprise inspection in June, they had carefully arranged the location of disaster relief goods and hidden liquor, so no private liquor was found on the first day of work. In response to this situation, everyone further developed discussions on working methods and concluded that they should start with small problems and trace the root causes in a timely manner. In this way, the fact that the Fuxing Oil and Wine Shop stored a basket of millet led to the investigation of unreported business tax and stamp tax, the content of a letter led to the discovery of alcohol mixed with liquor and the tracing of a part of the alcohol, the uneasy expression of the shopkeeper led to the discovery of a large amount of private liquor buried underground, and other illegal facts.
    This work proves that it is correct for investigation work to not relax on small issues and to get to the bottom of things. Although the surprise inspection has come to an end, comprehensive inspection work must still be paid attention to at any time in the future. As for contact with the masses, it was found in this work that what has been done in the past is still far from enough, and we must strengthen attention to this aspect in the future so that the investigation work to protect state property can be done more thoroughly.

### 严厉取缔私酒漏税　京税局突击检查　一周内查获违章案四百起

　　严厉取缔私酒漏税
    京税局突击检查
    一周内查获违章案四百起
    【本市讯】北京市税局自九月中旬开始突击检查私酒及印花税、行商税的工作，已有相当成绩，工作的第一周内即查获大小违章案件达四百零七起之多，其中查出酒精一千七百六十九斤半、又十磅，查出私酒共二千九百七十六斤、仿绍兴酒共五百余坛。这不但大大教育了不法商人，也保障了国家财政收益。经此次检查，本市酒业专卖公司的销酒量，已从原来每日不到两万斤增加到三万斤左右了。
    　　　　经验　从小事情入手及时追根究源
    本市土酒、啤酒，四月间即由政府明令禁止私酿。但由酒业专卖公司每日销售量来看，私酒仍大量存在。过去北京每天消费酒量在三四万斤左右，而酒业公司在八月间每天售量从未超过一万五千斤。这事实说明：私酒已转入“地下”。据调查，流行私酒大部系以酒精兑水制成；藏匿方法，更是无奇不有。私酒猖獗，给国家财政收入造成的损害是很大的。如以每日市面流行私酒两万斤计，则每月国家的损失即达四亿元之巨，约占全市总收入的三分之一。因此，除经常全面检查外，进行一次有重点的检查，十分必要。
    在市税局统一领导下，检查工作于九月十五日由各税务分局同时在辖区内分别进行。事先，市税局稽查科于十三日曾召集参加工作的干部报告了检查的目的与工作布置，使干部在思想上真正认识此一工作即系为保护国家财产而斗争，十分重要。各分局继于十四日就参加工作的干部分编成三二人的小组，分别举行座谈会，各就地区实际情况，研讨进行时的具体检查方式方法，一般均采以小组为单位，划区负责，相互联系。在工作干部配备方面，抽调了市税局二十人、酒业公司二十六人参加，连各分局干部，总计近二百人。
    由于大部大酒商因六月间曾受过一次突击检查，已把赈货及藏酒地点布置周密，在工作开始第一日，竟未发现私酒。针对此种情况，大家进一步展开工作方法上的讨论，结果认为应从小问题入手，要及时的追根究源。这样，便由福兴油酒店存一篓小米的事实而追究出来漏报行商税和印花税，由一封信的内容而查出酒精兑酒并追查出一部酒精，由店主神色不安而查出地下埋藏大量私酒等等违法事实。
    这次工作证明，稽查工作不放松小问题，追根究底是正确的。现在突击检查虽已告一段落，但今后全面检查工作，仍必须随时注意。至于与群众联系，在这次工作中发现过去做得尚十分不够，今后须加强这方面的注意，才能使保护国家财产的稽查工作做得更严密。
