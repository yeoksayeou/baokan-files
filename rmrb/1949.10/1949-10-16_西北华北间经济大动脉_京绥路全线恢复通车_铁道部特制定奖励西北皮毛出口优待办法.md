　　Economic Artery Between Northwest and North China
  　Beijing-Suiyuan Railway Fully Reopens to Traffic
    Ministry of Railways Formulates Preferential Measures to Reward Northwest Fur Exports
    [This newspaper dispatch] The economic artery connecting the Northwest and North China – the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway – will fully reopen to traffic on October 17th. Direct passenger trains between Beijing and Baotou will also resume service. The Beijing-Suiyuan Railway is 815 kilometers long, passing through 76 stations including Nankou, Zhangjiakou, Datong, Fengzhen, Pingdiquan, and Gui Sui to Baotou. Before the peaceful liberation of Suiyuan Province, it only ran from Beijing to Qixiaying. The section within Suiyuan, from Gui Sui to Baotou, and the section from Qixiaying to Gui Sui, had been out of service for about a year, greatly hindering the export of goods from the Northwest provinces and the exchange of materials from North China to the Great Northwest. After the full opening of the Beijing-Suiyuan line, specialty products from the Northwest such as wool, fur, grain, and medicinal materials can be exported in large quantities, and daily necessities such as paper, cloth, and tea bricks can be imported in large quantities, which will greatly affect the lives of people in the Great Northwest provinces. In order to take care of the lives of herders and encourage exports, the Ministry of Railways has reduced the freight rate for wool, camel hair, tails, manes (excluding horsehair and pig bristles), various animal hairs, horse hair, and livestock down from the fourth class to the seventh class. If the export of wool is certified by a provincial-level government or the Foreign Trade Bureau, the freight rate can be further reduced by 50%.
    Because Suiyuan has only recently been liberated, before the currency system is unified, the Ministry of Railways has specially formulated temporary operating measures for the Baitasi-Baotou section. It is stipulated that the calculation of passenger and freight rates and miscellaneous fees for all stations between Baitasi and Baotou shall be based on the Northern Freight Rate promulgated by the Ministry of Railways. The operating income of each station between Baitasi and Baotou shall be denominated in Renminbi, but silver dollar coupons shall be collected temporarily based on the exchange rate published by the People's Bank of China. There are also restrictions on passenger and freight transport. Passengers traveling from stations between Baitasi and Baotou, as well as luggage and parcels sent, will only be processed as far as Beijing; goods will only be processed as far as Tianjin East Station; however, there will be no restrictions on passengers, luggage, parcels, and goods sent from other operating lines nationwide to stations between Baitasi and Baotou.
    Direct passenger trains on the Beijing-Suiyuan line have been organized, extending the original 421 and 422 trains running between Beijing and Datong to Baotou. Train 421 departs from Beijing Station at 19:30 and arrives in Baotou at 6:43 the next day. Train 422 departs from Baotou at 18:55 and arrives in Beijing at 6:46. In addition, a pair of mixed trains runs between Datong and Gui Sui, with Train 447 departing from Datong at 6:45 and arriving in Gui Sui at 22:15. Train 448 departs from Gui Sui at 7:30 and arrives in Datong at 22:30. Another pair of mixed trains runs between Gui Sui and Baotou, with Train 449 departing from Gui Sui at 15:00 and arriving in Baotou at 19:45. Train 445 departs from Baotou at 7:00 and arrives in Gui Sui at 11:58. Taobqi Station will also begin handling freight operations with the opening of the Beijing-Baotou line.

　　西北华北间经济大动脉
  　京绥路全线恢复通车
    铁道部特制定奖励西北皮毛出口优待办法
    【本报讯】沟通西北与华北间的经济大动脉——京绥铁路于十月十七日全线恢复通车。北京、包头间直达客车亦同时恢复。京绥铁路全长八百十五公里。中经南口、张家口、大同、丰镇、平地泉、归绥等七十六站至包头。在绥远省未和平解放前，仅由北京通至旗下营。绥远境内由归绥通至包头，旗下营至归绥间约有一年未曾通车，大大阻碍了西北各省输出货物，与经由华北运往大西北的物资交流。京绥全线通车后，西北的特产羊毛、毛皮、粮食、药材等即可大量出口，日用必须品纸张、布匹及茶砖等亦可大量输入，对于大西北各省人民生活影响极大。铁道部并为照顾牧民生活，奖励出口，特将羊毛、驼毛、尾、鬃（马鬃、马尾、猪鬃除外）及各种兽毛、马毛、家畜的绒等运价由第四等减至第七等。输出羊毛若有省级以上政府证明和对外贸易局证明者，尚可减运价百分之五十。
    因为绥远解放不久，在币制没有统一之前，铁道部特制定白塔、包头间营业暂行办法。规定白塔、包头间各站客货运价杂费计算，一律依铁道部颁布的北方运费率计算。白塔、包头间各站营业进款以人民券为本位，但暂时依人民银行牌价折合率核收银元券。客、货运方面也有限制，凡由白塔、包头间各站乘车旅客以及发送的行李包裹，最远办理到北京为止；货物则最远办理到天津东站为止；但由全国其他各营业线发往白塔、包头间各站的旅客、行李、包裹及货物则不加限制。
    京绥线直达客车业已编成，以原北京、大同间运行的四二一、四二二次延长到包头。四二一次客车十九点三十分由北京站开出，第二天六点四十三分到达包头。四二二次客车十八点五十五分由包头开出，六点四十六分到达北京。此外，大同、归绥间开混合列车一对，四四七次六点四十五分由大同开出，二十二点十五分到达归绥。四四八次七点三十分由归绥开出，二十二点三十分到达大同。另归绥、包头间开混合列车一对，四四九次十五点由归绥开出，十九点四十五分到达包头。四四五次七点由包头开出，十一点五十八分到达归绥。陶卜旗站也随同京包间通车开始办理货运营业。　　　　　　　　　　　（人民铁道报社）
