This is a skillful symbol, indicating that the great Soviet Union is the first friendly country of the newborn People's Republic of China, indicating that Sino-Soviet friendship will develop with the development of the People's Republic of China."

Some children rushed up, shouting "Hurrah, Stalin!" and presented each representative with a bouquet of flowers.
