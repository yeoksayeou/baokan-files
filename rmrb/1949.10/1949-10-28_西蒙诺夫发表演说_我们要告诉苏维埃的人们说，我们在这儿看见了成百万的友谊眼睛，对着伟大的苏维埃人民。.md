Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 27th. Simonov, head of the Soviet cultural, artistic and scientific workers delegation, delivered a speech at the farewell meeting held by people from all walks of life in Beijing. The full text is as follows:

    Our dear friends, our dear Chinese comrades:

    Our Soviet cultural workers delegation has been in the People's Republic of China, which has warmly welcomed us, for almost a month. In the next few days, we will return to our country, to the Soviet Union.

    Therefore, each of our representatives is now recalling what we have come into contact with, seen and heard here, in the new China, in our memories. At the same time, each of our representatives also wants to return to their homeland and tell the Soviet people about the deeds of the new China and the great, heroic people of the new China.

    What did we see here? Thanks to the warm hospitality of our friends, the warm hospitality of the Chinese people, and the vast joy and sincerity of the hospitality like our own people treat friends, we have seen too much here.

    But when people recall, they always choose the most important and precious from everything they have seen.

    So what precious things did we see here? We saw a great people, a people celebrating their greatest victory, a people fighting to complete their victory. We also saw a people who armed themselves and are eliminating the shameless enemies supported by American imperialism, and at the same time, we saw them engaging in the restoration of the destroyed areas and the peaceful construction of their great country with great enthusiasm.

    We saw workers in factories working enthusiastically, firmly believing that under the new people's regime, everything created by their hands will improve the happiness of their country's people; they also firmly believe that the wealth created by their own labor will never be taken away by the Japanese invaders, and will never be taken away by the shameless, greedy and corrupt Chiang Kai-shek gang.

    We saw farmers in the countryside, preparing to contribute all their strength for the prosperity of their country. We also saw those farmers firmly believing that the people's regime is and will be doing everything to improve their lives, to reasonably solve the land problem, and to improve the domestic agricultural economy.

    We saw the intellectuals of the new China dedicating everything they have to serve their people. We also saw progressive intellectuals who clearly know what the people need, so they also know what they themselves have to do.

    We saw the commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, we saw these children of the people, who are the protectors of the people. We saw an army formed by the best forces of the Chinese working class, peasants and intellectuals. We also saw an army cultivated by the Chinese Communists, an army that is not only a school of courage and victory, but also a school of education and culture.

    We saw Chinese women in factories, rural areas, schools and the army, actively building the new China together with men. We saw the greatness of Chinese women, not only because they are the mothers, lovers and sisters of Chinese defenders and liberators, but also because they have their own creative work in labor and knowledge, and they do not fear hardships.

    We saw the young students of the new China, who fought so long, gloriously and heroically for the freedom and independence of their country against the Japanese invaders and American imperialists as well as domestic reactionaries. And now they are studying so diligently, trying to contribute what they have learned to their people who are building a new society as soon as possible.

    We saw the broad unity of all democratic forces in the country under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, the leader of the great Chinese people, and the Chinese Communist Party. This unity is based on this glorious intention, which is to unite all forces to serve their great country and great people.

    Everything we have seen here, and everything we are now recalling with excitement, we cultural workers, returning to our country, returning to our great Soviet Union, must tell the Soviet people, tell the most simple and most loyal old friends of the Chinese people.

    We will tell the Soviet people: We saw millions of friendly eyes here, shining with lively and passionate love, facing the Soviet Union, facing the great Soviet people, we are here as their humble representatives.

    We will tell the Soviet people: We heard thousands of questions about the friendship between our country and our people. These questions can only be asked by friends, and can only be answered by friends.

    We will tell the Soviet people: When we laid wreaths at the tomb of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, we, together with our Chinese people and friends, once again recalled how sincere and long-standing the friendship between our two peoples is! This friendship was pioneered and spread by the great name of Lenin.

    We will tell the Soviet people: With what deep joy our Chinese friends call our great Stalin the best friend of the Chinese people.

    We will tell the Soviet people: The friendship between our two great peoples has been consolidated and developed. This friendship has a great past, a great present, and it will face an even greater future.

    Our dear friends, our dear Chinese comrades, we are full of gratitude for your hospitality to us - the humble representatives of great Soviet culture. We regard your attention to us as attention to our entire country, to our great people as a whole.

    Long live Comrade Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese nation!

    Long live the great friendship between our two great peoples!

    Long live Comrade Stalin, the leader and guide of our country, and the friend of the working people of the world!

    我们要告诉苏维埃的人们说，我们在这儿看见了成百万的友谊眼睛，对着伟大的苏维埃人民。
    【新华社北京二十七日电】苏联文化艺术科学工作者代表团团长西蒙诺夫，在北京市各界人民欢送大会上发表演说，全文如下：
    我们亲爱的朋友们，我们亲爱的中国同志们：
    我们苏维埃文化工作者代表团，在这热诚招待我们的中华人民共和国里，已经快一个月了。在最近的几天，我们就要回国，回到苏联去。
    因此，现在我们每位代表，在自己记忆中，回想在此地，在新中国，所接触到的，回想所看到的和所听到的。同时，我们每位代表也想回到自己祖国去，想把新中国的和新中国的伟大英勇人民的种种事迹，告诉苏维埃人民。
    我们在这里看到些什么呢？由于我们朋友们的热诚招待，由于中国人民的热诚招待，由于象我们自己国家各民族对朋友招待的那样广大欢欣和真诚的招待，我们在此地看见的是太多了。
    但当人们在回忆的时候，总是从整个所看到的所见到的当中选择最重要的和最珍贵的。
    那么我们在这里看到些什么珍贵的呢？我们看见了伟大的人民，看见了庆祝自己最伟大胜利的人民，看见了为彻底完成胜利而斗争的人民。我们也看到自己亲手武装起来的人民，他们正在消灭着受美国帝国主义支持的无耻的敌人，同时也看到他们以高度的热情从事于被破坏区的恢复工作和从事于自己伟大的国家的和平建设事业。
    我们看到各工厂里的工人，他们热情地工作着，他们坚决地相信，在新的人民政权下，他们双手所创造的一切，将提高自己祖国人民的幸福；他们也坚决地相信，他们自己劳动所创造的财富，将永远不会被日本侵略者夺去，将永远不会被无耻的、贪婪腐化的蒋介石匪帮夺去。
    我们看到农村里的农民，为了繁荣自己的祖国他们准备供献出一切力量。我们也看到那些农民，坚决地相信，人民政权正在和将要进行一切工作，来改善他们的生活，来合理的解决土地问题，来提高国内的农业经济。
    我们看到新中国的知识分子，他们把自己的一切贡献出来，为自己的人民服务。我们也看到前进的知识分子，他们清楚地知道，人民需要些什么，因此他们也知道他们自己要作些什么。
    我们看到人民解放军的指挥员和战斗员，我们看到这些人民的儿女，他们都是人民的保卫者。我们看到了由中国工人阶级、农民和知识分子最优秀力量结成的军队。我们也看到由中国共产党人所培养的军队，这个军队不只是成为勇敢和胜利的学校，而且也是教育和文化的学校。
    我们看到工厂里，农村里，学校里和军队里的中国妇女，她们与男子们在一起积极地建设新中国。我们看到中国的妇女，她们的伟大，不仅是因为她们是中国保卫者和解放者的母亲、爱人和姊妹，而且还因为她们在劳动和知识各方面，有她们自己的不辞劳苦的创造工作。
    我们看到新中国青年学生们，他们为了自己祖国的自由和独立，曾经与日本侵略者和美国帝国主义者以及国内的反动派，那样长久地、光荣地和英勇地斗争。而现在他们则是那样用心地学习，力图尽速地把自己所学的贡献给自己的正在建设新社会中的人民。
    我们看到在伟大中国人民领袖毛泽东同志和中国共产党所领导的国内一切民主力量的广大团结，这种团结是以这种光荣意图为基础，就是联合一切力量为自己伟大国家和伟大人民来服务。
    我们在这里所看见的这一切，和我们每人以兴奋的心情现在回忆着的一切，我们这些文化工作者，回到祖国去，回到自己的伟大苏联去，一定要告诉苏维埃人民，告诉中国人民的最朴实、和最忠诚的老朋友们。
    我们要告诉苏维埃的人们说：我们在这儿看见了成百万的友谊眼睛，闪耀着活泼的热情的爱，对着苏联，对着伟大的苏维埃人民，我们在这儿正是他们的谦逊的代表人。
    我们要告诉苏维埃的人们说：我们听到了成千的关于我们祖国和我们人民的友谊问题，这些问题，只有朋友才能提出，也只有朋友才能回答。
    我们要告诉苏维埃的人们说：当在孙中山博士墓前献花圈的时候，我们随同我们的中国人士和朋友们，再度忆起了我们两国人民间的友谊，是怎样的真诚和悠久呵！这友谊是伟大的名字列宁给我们开路和传布开来的。
    我们要告诉苏维埃的人们说：我们的中国朋友们，以怎样深挚的欢快的心情，称呼我们的伟大的斯大林，为中国人民的最好的朋友。
    我们要告诉苏维埃的人民说：我们两国伟大人民间的友谊，巩固起来了，并发展起来了，这友谊有伟大的过去，有伟大的现在，并且它要面临更伟大的将来。
    我们的亲爱的朋友们，我们的亲爱的中国同志们，我们满心感谢你们对我们——伟大苏维埃文化的谦逊代表人们所表示的招待。我们把你们对我们的重视，看作是对我们的整个国家，对我们的伟大的全体人民的重视。
    中国国家的领袖毛泽东同志万岁！
    我们两国伟大人民的伟大友谊万岁！
    我们祖国的领袖和领导者、全世界劳动人民的朋友斯大林同志万岁！
