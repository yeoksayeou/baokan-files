[Beijing News] German priest Zeng Dewang and Austrian priest Ji Futai illegally detained six students, including He Cong, from Beijing's Furen Middle School for Boys on September 25. After the victimized students He Cong and others filed a complaint on October 1, the Municipal People's Court held an investigation court at the scene of the incident on the 4th and 5th to investigate, and held a court debate on the 8th to conclude the matter. The details have been reported in various newspapers in the city. The People's Court announced its verdict at 10:00 AM yesterday (29th): Defendants Zeng Dewang and Ji Futai were each sentenced to five days of detention for jointly infringing upon the freedom and insulting the personality of He Cong and the other six people. When He Cong and others went to Prince Gong's Mansion to collect branches that day, they met Long Ade, the acting dean of the Society of the Divine Word, and Ning Ziying, the gatehouse worker, at the west gate. After He Cong and others explained their intentions, Ning Ziying said, "You can go through the north gate," and Long Ade also nodded in agreement. Moreover, Prince Gong's Mansion is used by Fu Jen Catholic University. Although the church proposed to the Fu Jen Catholic University Committee to take it back for church use during the summer vacation this year, no decision has been made. Of course, the church has no right to interfere with He Cong and others going to Prince Gong's Mansion to collect cypress branches. As for the lost lock, the defendant Zeng Dewang has admitted: "The lock was lost between 12:15 and 1:00 PM that day, while He Cong and others entered the north gate after 1:00 PM that afternoon." When questioning the defendants and related parties, they could not provide any evidence, which shows that what they said was unfounded. The defendants Zeng Dewang and Ji Futai, without waiting for the official discussion of the Fu Jen Catholic University Committee, arbitrarily planned to assign the address of Prince Gong's Mansion to the church and forcibly interfered with Fu Jen Catholic University High School student He Cong and others collecting cypress branches, which was already inappropriate. Furthermore, priests Long Ade, Zhong Pan Shi, and Guan Demei, along with the defendants Zeng Dewang and Ji Futai, jointly participated in the action in a planned and organized manner, falsely accusing He Cong and others of theft by despicable means. This kind of insulting behavior is obviously a criminal offense. They used the excuse of losing a spring lock and did not report it to the public security organs, but locked up He Cong and the other six people, which constituted a crime of infringing upon freedom. As for the fact that the defendants considered this a trivial matter after the incident occurred, this is because they ignored the fact that the Chinese people have stood up. Such illegal actions of infringing upon personal freedom and insulting young students are absolutely not allowed by the People's Government and must be punished according to law. However, because they showed remorse after He Cong and others filed the complaint, the People's Court has given a lighter sentence of five days of detention each.

　　犯罪捷德籍神甫　
    各判处拘役五天　
    市人民法院昨宣判
    【北京讯】捷籍神甫曾德望、德籍神甫纪福泰于九月二十五日非法扣留本市辅仁男中学生何琮等六人一案，经受害学生何琮等六人于十月一日具呈控诉后，本市人民法院在四、五两日到出事地点开调查庭侦讯，并于八日在法院开庭辩论终结，经过详情已先后分志本市各报。人民法院于昨（二十九）日上午十时宣布判决：被告曾德望、纪福泰共同妨害自由并侮辱何琮等六人人格罪各处拘役五天。何琮等于当日去恭王府采折树枝时，曾在西门遇到圣言会代理院长龙阿德和门房工友宁梓英，由何琮等说明来意后，宁梓英说“可走北门”，龙阿德亦点头允许，何况恭王府是由辅仁大学使用，在今年暑假教会虽曾向辅大校委会提议收归教会使用，但未做决定，当然何琮等去恭王府采柏树枝教会无权过问，至丢锁问题，被告曾德望已承认：“丢锁时间是在当日十二点一刻到一点之间，而何琮等进北门是在当日下午一时以后”，质问被告及被告关系人等，均又不能举出证明，显见所说无稽。被告曾德望、纪福泰等不待辅仁大学校委会之正式讨论，竟将恭王府地址擅拟划归教会所有，硬行干涉辅大附中学生何琮等采柏树枝已属不当，而神甫龙阿德、仲磐石、关德美等复同被告曾德望、纪福泰等有计划的、有组织的共同参与行动，以卑鄙手段将何琮等诬为窃盗，这种侮辱行为显系有犯刑章；他们借口遗失弹簧锁，不向公安机关报告，而把何琮等六人禁闭起来，妨害自由之罪确已构成。至于本案发生后，被告等曾认为是一件小事，这是因为他们忽视了中国人民已经站立起来，象这样妨害人身自由，污辱青年学生的非法行动，是人民政府绝对所不允许的，一定要依法予以制裁，唯以他们在何琮等提起控诉以后，尚有悔过之意，故人民法院特予从轻判决各处拘役五天。
