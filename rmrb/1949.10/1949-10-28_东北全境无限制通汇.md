　　Unlimited Remittance Throughout Northeast China
    [Reported by this newspaper] In order to adapt to the current situation, the Northeast Bank has decided to implement unlimited remittance within the Northeast region starting from November 1st. Except for a few towns where transportation is inconvenient and no banks are established and remittance is not yet possible, in all areas where remittance is already available, both organizations and individuals, public funds or private funds, can freely remit without any restrictions. There are two types of fees required for remittance: one is the remittance fee, which is charged at a rate of one per thousand for general remittances exceeding ten million yuan, and is waived for those less than ten million yuan; the other is the handling fee, which is charged per remittance transaction, with a general handling fee of 20,000 yuan per transaction. However, there are preferential measures for remitting public funds or family support payments: agencies and state-owned enterprises holding letters of proof of public funds, or those with contracts with the Northeast Bank, as well as out-of-town agencies and state-owned enterprises remitting funds to this city, where the recipient is also an agency or state-owned enterprise, are exempt from remittance fees. For remittances for family support by staff and teachers, if they hold a letter of introduction from the trade union or agency, both remittance fees and handling fees will be waived.

　　东北全境无限制通汇
    【本报讯】东北银行适应目前形势，决定自十一月一日起，在东北区内，实行无限制通汇。除少数城镇，因交通不便，无银行设置，尚未通汇外，凡已通汇之地区，不论团体与个人，公款或私款，均可自由汇兑，无任何限制。汇款所要的费用有两种：一种是汇费，凡超过千万元以上的一般汇款，按千分之一收费，不足千万元者免收；一种是手续费，按汇款笔数，每笔一般的征收手续费二万元。但对汇寄公款或赡家费者另有优待办法：凡机关公营企业如持有公款证明之函件者，或与东北银行订有合同者，以及外埠机关公营企业来本埠拨款，其收款人亦为机关公营企业者，均免收汇费。职工及公教人员赡家汇款，如持有职工会或机关介绍信时，汇费手续费均免收。
