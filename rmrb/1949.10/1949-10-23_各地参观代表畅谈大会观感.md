　　Representatives from Various Regions
  　Talk About Their Impressions of the Conference
    [Our Newspaper's Report] At the opening ceremony of the Beijing People's Sports Conference, representatives from various regions expressed their views. Xie Bangding, Chairman of the All-China Student Federation, said: The Chinese People's Liberation Army has liberated vast lands and vast numbers of people, returning everything in the country to the hands of the people, and sports has also returned to the hands of the people. In the people's country, sports is moving in a new direction—the direction of the people. Its purpose is to improve the people's health and cultivate the people's strong character, so as to serve the country's great and glorious national defense construction and production construction. The All-China Student Federation sent a basketball team to participate in the 10th World University Summer Games organized by the International Student Union, and they were warmly welcomed. This shows that our people's sports not only has the guidance and help of the People's Government, but also the expectations and encouragement of international friends. We firmly believe that from this conference onwards, the new mass sports movement will flourish and develop in all schools and factories across the country, and will be able to serve the country's various construction undertakings.
    Wu Bangwei and others from the Shanghai sports community felt that there were two points worth noting at this conference: (1) It pointed out the new direction of sports in the future. The programs performed everywhere showed a close combination with politics, expressing love for the motherland, the people, and their great leader, and expressing the Chinese people's spirit of loving peace. (2) It brought into play the collectivity of sports. In the performance, there were no signs of the past championshipism and vicious infighting, but a unified display of the new atmosphere of unity, emerging, liveliness, and freedom, and the order was good, which was unprecedented.
    Huang Shi and others from the Jinan delegation believed that the conference was well organized, with programs proceeding in a planned and orderly manner, lively and solemn, which was exciting. From this conference, a new direction for sports was pointed out: (1) Collectivity; (2) Unity; (3) Creativity. They expressed that they would humbly learn from the conference and bring this new direction and new spirit back to Jinan. They believed that this conference would be a new beginning and would promote the widespread development of this new sports movement throughout the country.
    Liu Changchun, from the Northeast delegation, was formerly a Chinese sprinter and record holder in the 100 meters. He believed that this Beijing Sports Conference was of unprecedented significance. He said: Sports must be popularized, abandoning individual heroism, so that everyone can regularly participate in sports activities and universally improve the level of sports.
    Xu Yingchao, director of the Physical Education Department of Normal University, said: He is still new to participating in the preparation of such a people's sports conference. Everything is still being done by groping. But he firmly believes that this sports conference will definitely be more successful than any previous sports conference. He recalled that past sports meetings mainly showed personal achievements and encouraged "championshipism"; each unit was also prone to showing "departmentalism," so many unclear disputes often occurred in the competition. This conference is different from the past, focusing on bringing into play the collective spirit. It is not only that the participating units are responsible for themselves, but also that the entire unit is responsible to the conference. This conference does not take personal success as glory, but the victory of the conference as glory. The victory of the conference is the success of the new sports.

　　各地参观代表
  　畅谈大会观感
    【本报讯】在北京市人民体育大会开幕会上，各地代表纷纷发表观感。中华全国学生联合会主席谢邦定说：中国人民解放军解放了广大土地和广大人民，使国家的一切都回到了人民的手里，体育也回到了人民的手里。在人民的国家里，体育正走向一个新的方向——人民大众的方向。它的目的是要增进人民的身体健康，培养人民的坚强品质，以便为祖国伟大光荣的国防建设与生产建设服务。中华全国学生联合会派出篮球队参加国际学联主办的第十届世界大学生夏季运动会，他们受到了热烈的欢迎。这说明了我们人民的体育，不仅有人民政府的指导和帮助，而且有国际友人的期望和鼓励。我们坚信从这次大会起，人民大众的新体育运动将普遍在全国各学校各工厂蓬勃地展开与发展起来，并将能服务于国家的各种建设事业。
    上海体育界吴邦伟等觉得这次大会有两点值得重视的地方：（一）它指出了今后体育的新方向。这次表演的节目处处表现出与政治的密切结合，它表现着对祖国、人民及其伟大领袖的热爱，表现着中国人民热爱和平的精神。（二）发挥了体育的集体性。在表演中看不出过去的锦标主义、互相暗斗的恶劣现象，却一致显现了团结、新兴、活泼、自由的新气象，而且秩序良好，为过去所未有。
    济南代表团黄狮等认为这次大会组织得颇为完善，有计划、有秩序的进行节目，活泼而严肃，令人兴奋。从这次大会里，指出了体育的新方向：（一）集体性；（二）团结性；（三）创造性。他们表示要向大会虚心学习，把这种新方向新精神带回济南去。他们相信，这次大会将是一个新的开始，将推动全国各地普遍展开这种新的体育运动。
    东北代表团的刘长春过去是中国的短跑家、百米记录的保持者，他认为这次北京体育大会具有空前的意义。他说：体育运动必须大众化，抛弃个人英雄主义，使每一个人都能经常参加体育活动，普遍地提高体育运动水平。
    师大体育系主任徐英超说：对于参加筹备这样的一个人民体育大会，他还是一个新的学习。一切都还是摸索着去做。但他坚决地相信，这次的体育大会一定比过去任何次的体育大会开得都成功。他回忆过去运动会中主要是表现个人的成绩，鼓励“锦标主义”；每个单位也多容易表现“本位主义”，因此在竞赛中常常发生许多弄不清的争执。这次大会与过去不同，以发挥集体精神为主，不只是参加各单位自己负责，而且要全体向大会负责。这次大会不是以个人成功为荣，而是以大会的胜利为荣。大会的胜利，就是新体育的成功。
