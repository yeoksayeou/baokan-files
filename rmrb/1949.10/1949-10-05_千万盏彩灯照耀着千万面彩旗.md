    [This newspaper reports] Jinan, the capital of Shandong Province, with a population of 200,000, and Qingdao, with a population of 300,000, held rallies on the 2nd to warmly celebrate the founding of the People's Republic of China and the Central People's Government, as well as the election of the great people's leader, Chairman Mao Zedong, and held demonstrations for the International Day of Struggle for Peace.
    In Jinan, as the sun rose, the sound of gongs and drums reverberated throughout every corner of the city. Workers, soldiers, staff, students, and citizens all happily rushed to the designated assembly points. Every household hung bright red national flags, and the streets were adorned with pine gates and colorful arches, creating a completely new atmosphere, with the entire city rejoicing. At noon, 200,000 organized individuals from various government offices, troops, factories, schools, and civilian groups, holding high the national flag and huge portraits of the people's leader, converged from all directions at Jinan West Suburb Airport. At 3:00 PM, an unprecedented grand celebration solemnly opened with the booming of twenty-eight cannons. At the meeting, Kang Sheng, Secretary of the Shandong Branch of the CPC Central Committee and Chairman of the Shandong Provincial People's Government, Vice Chairman Guo Zihua, Yuan Ye, Deputy Commander of the Shandong Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, Liu Shunyuan, Secretary of the Jinan Municipal Committee of the CPC, and representatives from all sectors of the people delivered speeches successively. They expressed the common will of the people of Shandong and Jinan in a common language. They unanimously stated: resolutely support the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao Zedong; under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, strive to realize the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, to implement the people's democratic dictatorship throughout Shandong, to strengthen economic and cultural construction, to powerfully support the national liberation war, and to build a new Shandong; support the International Day of Struggle for Peace, resolutely stand in the international peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, and oppose the conspiracies of the new war provocateurs. The congress also sent congratulatory telegrams to Chairman Mao Zedong, Vice Chairmen, and all members of the government of the Central People's Government, and to the Chinese People's Congress for the Defense of World Peace. At 6:00 PM, the congress ended, and the demonstration team of torchlight parades entered the urban area in four routes. Thousands of colored lanterns reflected thousands of colored flags. Five-colored signal flares flashed in the air, and military music, slogans, gongs, drums, and songs rose and fell one after another, with the parade team stretching for several miles. All the residents of Jinan poured into the streets, rejoicing until late at night.
    Xuzhou, a military and economic stronghold in northern Jiangsu, also held a demonstration parade of 60,000 people on the 2nd to celebrate the founding of the People's Republic of China and the Central People's Government, the election of Chairman Mao Zedong, and to express their determination to defend world peace. National flags fluttered throughout the city on an unprecedented scale. 360,000 citizens and farmers in the nearby suburbs participated in an unprecedented carnival. The parade was led by huge portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. As the troops of the garrison's infantry, cavalry, artillery, and tank units marched majestically through the crowded streets, shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the People's Liberation Army!" "Defend World Peace!" and applause resounded through the clouds. At the celebration meeting, Mayor Zhang Beihua called on the citizens of Xuzhou to actively engage in production, eliminate bandits and special agents, and celebrate the birth of the new China with practical actions.
