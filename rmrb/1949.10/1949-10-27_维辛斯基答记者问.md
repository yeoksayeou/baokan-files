　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 26th: Moscow Radio broadcast on the 21st: After issuing a statement, Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky answered the following questions posed to him by foreign reporters:

　　Regarding the Eligibility of Yugoslavia for Election to the Security Council

　　National Broadcasting Company Reporter: Two years ago, would the Soviet Union have supported Yugoslavia's eligibility for election to the Security Council, and if so, could you tell us why the Soviet Union does not support this candidate today?

　　Vyshinsky replied: The Soviet delegation two years ago, three years ago, supported and has since continued to support such eligibility, which is proposed by a majority of countries belonging to a particular region. Thus, when Latin American countries proposed Argentina as a candidate in 1947, the Soviet delegation voted in favor of that candidate, although relations between Argentina and the Soviet Union, both then to a considerable extent and now, regrettably, were far from satisfactory.

　　When a majority of countries belonging to a certain region propose a certain candidate, the Soviet delegation, in accordance with the gentleman's agreement it participates in, supports the candidate proposed by the majority of countries in that region. Now, the majority of countries belonging to the Eastern European region—the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Poland, the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic—unanimously propose Czechoslovakia, not Yugoslavia. Therefore, Yugoslavia, if it observes this gentleman's agreement and established practices, has the responsibility to abandon its candidacy and should not compete with Czechoslovakia's candidacy.

　　BBC Reporter: The Deputy Foreign Minister of Yugoslavia declared that Yugoslavia deserves a seat on the Security Council because of its contribution to the cause of liberation of all countries. What is your view on this matter?

　　Vyshinsky replied: Doesn't the BBC reporter really understand the issue related to Yugoslavia's statement? He said: Yugoslavia demands this seat because of its contribution to the cause of liberating democratic countries from Hitler's rule. Didn't Czechoslovakia contribute to this cause? I think the BBC reporter, who also works for a news company, can answer this question himself. Famous company, as they say! Is it correct to say that Yugoslavia made a greater contribution to the cause of liberation from Hitler's rule? What about Byelorussia, Ukraine, Poland, and Czechoslovakia? Their contributions are no less than those of countries that boast about themselves, but much greater.

　　"Montreal Star" Reporter: Did the Soviet Union vote in favor of Canada in 1947?

　　Vyshinsky replied: Yes, it did vote in favor of it. That was in 1947. We voted in favor of Argentina, which was the candidate of the Latin American group of countries, and we voted in favor of Canada, which was the candidate of the so-called British Commonwealth countries, and we voted in favor of Ukraine. We have always voted honestly.

　　Agence France-Presse Reporter: Can it be assumed that your statement means that if Yugoslavia is elected, the Soviet Union will refuse to attend Security Council meetings, and can your attendance at the Security Council be considered recognition of Yugoslavia's election?

　　Vyshinsky replied: I have said that the Soviet Union cannot recognize such a rudely violation of UN practice (about which I have already spoken) and the UN Charter (Article 23) as legitimate or legal. As for what the Soviet Union will do in the future, the esteemed reporter who raised this question should know that the Soviet Union has never spoken before acting. I haven't seen the need to break this good strategic rule yet.

　　Associated Press Reporter: You said that Yugoslavia's election would be a further offensive against the Soviet Union by the United States and Britain, or an action similar to an offensive. How does this align with Britain's determination to vote for Czechoslovakia? Is there a clear division between the United States and Britain on this issue?

　　Vyshinsky replied: I am glad to hear that Britain will vote for Czechoslovakia. If your reporter says that Britain will vote for Czechoslovakia, that's good. If he asks how this position is consistent with my statement that the US-British bloc is engaging in weakening cooperation within the United Nations, then he should ask the British representative about this.

　　I am talking about the fact that some national delegations, led by the United States, decided to support Yugoslavia in the Security Council election, against all other candidates proposed by the Eastern European countries. I said that this is a violation of the gentleman's agreement, a violation of Article 23 of the UN Charter, a violation of the principle of consultation between interested countries on candidates, and a violation of the obligation of all countries' representatives to support this agreed-upon eligibility. And how will Britain act? The reporter probably knows no more about this issue than I do. If Britain votes for Czechoslovakia, that's good. However, I do not believe this, because it is inconsistent with all of Britain's actions on the election issue. Perhaps I am wrong in my estimation. I would be glad if my estimation is wrong.

　　Regarding the Atomic Energy Issue

　　Associated Press Reporter: I would like to ask if Your Excellency is willing to talk about the Soviet Union's proposal on atomic energy, which may have been submitted to the UN General Assembly?

　　Vyshinsky replied: I have already spoken about the Security Council election issue, because I think this issue is particularly noteworthy on the eve of the election. If anyone is interested in the atomic bomb issue, or the atomic energy issue, then I do not refuse to answer this question within my limited time. You ask: Does the Soviet Union intend to submit any suggestions on this issue? Not only does it intend to, but it already has. The Soviet delegation submitted its proposal on this issue on September 23rd. This proposal is mentioned in point two. The Soviet Union suggests that the UN General Assembly request all countries to prohibit the use of atomic weapons and take practical control measures to implement the resolution on the prohibition. According to TASS news, everyone knows that although the Soviet Union has possessed atomic weapons since 1947, when Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov said that the atomic bomb was no longer a secret to the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union now and in the future resolutely and thoroughly advocates the prohibition of atomic weapons and the establishment of strict international control to enforce this ban.

　　National Broadcasting Company Reporter: You talked about practical action issues. Can you talk about why the Soviet government is taking this position, that is, you do not consider the Western countries' proposed agreement on control, that is, the plan regarding the investigation of industrial and other activities. Can you definitively decide what will be done in this regard?

　　Vyshinsky replied: This can be said to be a completely incorrect understanding of the Soviet Union's position. I should express surprise that NBC's representative Pearson appears so ignorant that he can interpret the Soviet Union's position in this way, even with universally known documents as proof. For example, I am referring to the document of June 11, 1947, which mentions that the Soviet Union advocates the implementation of this international control; it is planned to implement inspections and inspection rights on the state of atomic energy production, so that the resolution to ban atomic weapons cannot be violated.

　　To provide proof, I urge you to pay attention to the document of June 11, 1947. This document says:

　　"In order to ensure the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes and in accordance with the international convention on the prohibition of atomic weapons and other important weapons for large-scale annihilation of humanity, in order to prevent the convention on the prohibition of atomic weapons and the protection of countries from being violated, and in order to prevent the terms of the convention from being grossly violated and evaded, strict international management should be established for all enterprises engaged in the mining of atomic raw materials and the manufacturing of atomic materials."

　　Furthermore, in order to implement measures to control atomic energy enterprises, a special international control committee should be established. It should have its own inspection agency. In order to ensure the effectiveness of this control, the convention should be based on the following provisions.

　　The International Control Committee should implement the following controls on atomic energy enterprises: 1. Inspect the activities of enterprises engaged in the mining of atomic raw materials and the manufacturing of atomic energy, and review their reports. 2. Review the existing inventory of atomic raw materials, atomic materials, and atomic semi-finished products. 3. Inspect the implementation of the convention and whether its implementation is correct, formulate rules for the technical operation of the above-mentioned enterprises and rules for the technical control of these enterprises.

　　In this document, there are also five provisions on inspection, and these provisions resolutely refute your own views on the position established by the Soviet Union. However, the Soviet Union cannot agree to the US control plan, because this so-called international control plan is not international control but a US super-trust.

　　National Broadcasting Company Reporter: When you say that the US proposal, if implemented, would infringe upon the sovereignty of the Soviet Union, is that the case, and what do you base that on?

　　Vyshinsky replied: When someone sticks his nose into matters that should be handled by sovereign states themselves, he begins to infringe on sovereignty, but now there are greedy people sticking their noses into other people's business.

　　Regarding the Balkans Issue

　　Domei News Agency Reporter: Mr. Vyshinsky, I would like to move on to another matter and ask you to talk about the Conciliation Committee. Can you briefly talk about the Conciliation Committee on the Balkan issue? Can you give us some explanation of the basis for these negotiations?

　　Vyshinsky replied: Yes, although I am not the chairman of the Conciliation Committee. As far as I know, the negotiations on the so-called "Balkan issue" have not achieved positive results due to disagreements on several issues.

　　One of these issues is the Albania-Greece border issue. The Soviet delegation has suggested writing in the agreement: Albania and Greece declare to each other that the existing Albania-Greece border is the final border. Someone has presented us—the Soviet delegation—with two almost identical options. They suggested that Albania and Greece should not use force or the threat of force when resolving territorial disputes. What does this mean? This means: The issue of the border is disputable, and it may be returned to dispute in the future. The Soviet delegation believes that the issue of the Albania-Greece border is not open to dispute.

　　Everyone knows that Albania will never obtain anything from Greece, while Greece attempts to obtain northern Epirus, and the Greek government has repeatedly issued statements on this. If the Conciliation Committee does not agree with our statement of the issue, it means that the Conciliation Committee is unwilling to express opposition to the territorial demands of the Greek government. We cannot agree with this statement of the issue.

　　New York Times Reporter: According to TASS reports in May of this year, A. Gromyko claimed that there were two unresolved issues. These are the issue of Greek amnesty and the issue of Greek national elections. You say that there is now an Albania-Greece issue. Can it be understood that there are no disagreements on the remaining issues?

　　Vyshinsky replied: Regarding the border, I said that this is one of the important issues of disagreement. Other issues raised by Gromyko in New York on May 20 are still as before. These suggestions have not been adopted by the Conciliation Committee either. This is certainly also a very important disagreement. But I don't know what the Conciliation Committee thinks the deadlock is?

　　Domei News Agency Reporter: What is the Soviet government's view on the necessary basic conditions for establishing peace and democracy in Greece?

　　Vyshinsky replied: This has been explained in our proposal published by TASS on May 20, 1949.

　　Agence France-Presse Reporter: Can it be understood that the Soviet Union's position on the issue of Greek amnesty and elections is final and cannot be changed, or are there ways to reach an agreement on these issues?

　　Vyshinsky replied: The Soviet Union's firm position, as the reporter said, is final. As for the possibility of reaching an agreement, it is necessary to know on what basis an agreement can be reached.

　　Regarding China's Representation in the Security Council

　　Pan-Radio Communications Agency Reporter: May I be allowed to cite your original speech on the Security Council, in which you talked about expressing some concern for the geographical representation of non-permanent members. If you think this is also true for permanent members, and since the Soviet Union has recognized the new government of China, then why does the Soviet Union not demand immediate correction of the geographical representation of China on the Security Council? Why doesn't the Soviet Union raise this issue?

　　Vyshinsky replied: On my part, I would like to ask: Why should the Soviet Union be in a hurry? Everything has its own timing.

　　What Does Optimism Need?

　　International News Service Reporter (female): I am interested in optimism. Can you tell me what the world relies on to lay the foundation for optimism at the present time. I think a certain amount of optimism is necessary for peace.

　　Vyshinsky replied: Of course there is a basis necessary for optimism. And if we talk about the United Nations organization, then optimism here does not require many things, it is enough to fully comply with several basic rules: do not interfere in your neighbors' affairs, abide by the UN Charter, abide by gentleman's agreements, do not plot behind the scenes, and do not harm friends. Isn't that still not enough to be optimistic? I think, on this basis, it is possible to strengthen the United Nations organization and establish reasonable cooperation between countries. I haven't even talked about rejecting the propaganda of new wars, especially the preparations for new wars, and rejecting what is needed to threaten with bombs, especially with atomic bombs. Really, it can now be pointed out that there seems to be some change in this regard.

　　Regarding Italy's Trusteeship of Somaliland

　　Negro News Agency Reporter: This spring and at this session of the General Assembly, the leadership of the Somaliland Youth Organization declared: If Italy obtains the trusteeship of Somaliland, then the people of Somaliland will rise up in opposition and will resist to the last person. Because some members of the Political Committee have declared that they want to give Italy the trusteeship of Somaliland, do you or the Soviet delegation believe that the situation in Somaliland is a threat to peace? If so, does this issue not fall under the jurisdiction of the Security Council but under the jurisdiction of the Political Committee?

　　Vyshinsky replied: The Soviet Union takes a completely clear and definite position in matters related to national liberation movements in this or that country. The issue raised by a member of our conference, that is, the issue that belongs both to the jurisdiction of the Security Council and to the jurisdiction of the Political Committee, of course requires special study. Everyone knows that the oppression of various ethnic groups by colonial powers is often enough to become the spark that can ignite the flames of war.

### 维辛斯基答记者问

1949-10-27

专栏：

　　维辛斯基答记者问
    【新华社北京二十六日电】莫斯科电台二十一日广播：苏联外长维辛斯基在发表声明之后，对于外国记者向他所提出的问题，作了如下的答复：
    关于安理会中南斯拉夫被选资格问题
    国家广播公司记者问：两年以前，苏联是否会支持南斯拉夫在安理会里的被选资格，如果是的话，那末你能不能告诉我们：为什么苏联今天不支持这个候选国？
    维辛斯基答：苏联代表团在两年以前，三年以前曾经支持并且在此后一直支持这样的被选资格，它是由属于某一个地域的多数国家提出的。因而，当拉丁美洲国家于一九四七年提出阿根廷为候选国时，苏联代表团投票支持这个候选国，虽然阿根廷与苏联之间，当时在颇大程度上和现在一样，很遗憾地存在着远非美满的关系。
    当属于一定地域的多数国家提出某个候选国的时候，苏联代表团按照它所参加的君子协定，支持这个由该区域内多数国家所提的候选国。现在，属于东欧区域的多数国家——苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、乌克兰、白俄罗斯共和国一致提出捷克斯洛伐克，而不是南斯拉夫。因之，南斯拉夫如果它遵守这个君子协定以及既定的惯例的话，就有责任放弃自己的候选，不应该与捷克斯洛伐克的候选相竞争。
    英国广播公司记者问：南斯拉夫外交部副部长宣称，南斯拉夫由于它对于各国解放事业的贡献而配得安理会里的席位。你对这个问题的观点如何？
    维辛斯基答：英国广播公司的记者真的不了解与南斯拉夫的声明相联系着的问题吗？他说：南斯拉夫由于它对于使民主国家从希特勒统治之下解放出来的事业的贡献，而要求这个席位。难道捷克斯洛伐克对这个事业没有贡献吗？我想，也是一个新闻公司的英国广播公司的记者是会自己答复这个问题的。有名的公司，怎么说的！说南斯拉夫好象对于从希特勒统治之下求解放的事业有过更大的贡献，这种说法正确吗？而白俄罗斯，乌克兰，波兰和捷克斯洛伐克怎么样呢？它们的贡献并不小于那些为自己吹嘘的国家，而是大得多。
    “蒙特利尔明星”报记者问：苏联曾经在一九四七年投票赞成加拿大吗？
    维辛斯基答：是，投票赞成过它的。那是在一九四七年。我们投票赞成阿根廷，它是拉丁美洲国家群的候选国，我们投票支持加拿大，它是所谓不列颠联邦国家的候选国，我们投票支持乌克兰。我们一向诚实地投票。
    法新社记者问：能否认为你的声明意味着，如果南斯拉夫当选的话，苏联将拒绝出席安理会会议，能否将你的出席安理会认为是承认了南斯拉夫的当选呢？
    维辛斯基答：我说过，苏联不能承认这种粗鲁地违背联合国惯例（关于这一点，我已经讲过）以及联合国宪章（第二十三条）的选举是正当或合法的。至于苏联今后将要怎么做，那末，提出这个问题的可敬的记者先生应该知道，苏联向来不是先说后做的。我还没有看到破坏这个战略上的良好规则的必要性。
    美联社记者问：你说过，南斯拉夫的当选将成为美英进一步的对苏联的攻势，或者类似攻势的行动。这一点怎样和英国投票支持捷克斯洛伐克的决心相符合？在这个问题上，美国和英国之间是不是显然存在着分歧？
    维辛斯基答：我很高兴地听说，英国将投票支持捷克斯洛伐克。如果贵记者说，英国将投票支持捷克斯洛伐克，这很好。如果他问，这个立场怎样和我关于美英集团正在从事削弱联合国的合作这一声明相协调，那末，关于这一点，他应该去问英国代表。
    我谈到这个事实：即以美国为首的某些国家代表团，决定在安理会选举中支持南斯拉夫，来对抗东欧各国所提出的所有其他候选国，我说过，这是破坏君子协定，破坏联合国宪章第二十三条，破坏由利益攸关的国家协商候选国的原则，破坏关于一切国家的代表应支持这个已达成协议的被选资格的义务。而英国将如何行动呢？在这个问题上，这个记者所知道的大概不会比我少。如果英国投票支持捷克斯洛伐克，那很好。然而我不相信这一点，因为这是和英国在选举问题上的一切行动相矛盾的。也许我估计是错的。我很高兴我的估计是错误的。
    关于原子能问题
    美联社记者问：我愿意问，贵部长是否愿意谈谈苏联关于原子能的建议，这个建议也许已经向联合国大会提出？
    维辛斯基答：我已经谈过安理会选举问题，因为我认为，在举行选举的前夕，这个问题是特别令人注意的。如果有谁对原子弹问题，或者对原子弹问题感兴趣，那末，我不拒绝在我的有限的时间之内答复这个问题。你问：苏联是否打算提出关于这个问题的任何建议？不仅是打算，而且已经提出了。苏联代表团已于九月二十三日提出它关于这个问题的建议。这个建议是在第二点里提到的。苏联建议联合国大会要求一切国家禁止使用原子武器并采取实际的管制措施来执行关于禁用的决议。根据塔斯社的消息，大家知道，虽然苏联从一九四七年起就握有原子武器，当时苏联外交部长莫洛托夫说过，原子弹对于苏联已不是秘密，但是，苏联现在和将来坚决和彻底地主张禁用原子武器，主张建立严格的国际管制以执行这个禁令。
    国家广播公司记者问：你谈到实际行动问题。你能不能谈一谈，苏联政府为什么采取这种立场，就是你不考虑西方国家所提的关于管制的协议，即关于调查工业及其他活动的协议的方案。你们能不能确切地决定在这一方面将做什么？
    维辛斯基答：这可以说是完全不正确地了解苏联的立场。我应该表示惊异：国家广播公司的代表皮尔逊显得如此寡闻，以致于在尽人皆知的文件证明之下，竟然能如此解释苏联的立场。譬如说，我指的是一九四七年六月十一日文件，其中提到苏联主张实施这种国际管制；它预定实行检查以及原子能生产状况的检查权，使得禁用原子武器的决议不容违背。
    为了提供证明，我促请你们注意一九四七年六月十一日的文件。这个文件里这样说：
    “为保证利用原子能于和平目的并符合关于禁用原子武器以及其他大规模消灭人类的重要武器的国际公约起见，为防止关于禁用原子武器及保护国家的公约受破坏，为防止公约的条款遭受粗鲁的违背及规避起见，应该对于从事原子原料开采以及原子材料制造的一切企业，同时建立严格的国际管理”。
    更进一步说，为了实行对原子能企业管制的措施，应该设立特别的国际管制委员会。它应该拥有自己的检查机构。为了保证这种管制之有效，公约应以下列的规定作为其基础。
    国际管制委员会应该对原子能企业实施下列管制：一、对从事原子原料开采及原子能制造的企业的活动进行检查，并审查其报告。二、审查原子原料，原子材料及原子半制成品的现有存货。三、检查公约的执行以及其执行得是否正确，制定上述企业的技术上的经营的规则以及对这些企业实施技术上管制的规则。
    在这个文件里，还有关于检查的五项规定，这些条款断然地驳倒你们自己对苏联的立场所建立的观念。然而苏联不能同意美国的管制计划，因为这种所谓国际管制计划不是国际管制而是美国的超级托辣斯。
    国家广播公司记者问：当你说美国的建议如果付诸实行的话就会侵犯苏联的主权，事情是否这样的，你根据什么来证明呢？
    维辛斯基答：当有人把自己的鼻子伸到要由主权国家自己来处理的事情上去的时候，他就开始侵犯主权，然而现在即有贪婪之徒把他的鼻子伸到别人的事情上去。
    关于巴尔干问题
    电通社记者问：维辛斯基先生，我愿转到另外的事，并请您就调解委员会讲一些话。您能简略谈一谈关于巴尔干问题调解委员会吗？您能给我们对这些谈判的根据作若干解释吗？
    维辛斯基答：可以，虽然我不是调解委员会的主席。就我所知，关于所谓“巴尔干问题”所进行的谈判，由于对若干问题的分歧而未获得肯定的结果。
    这些问题当中有一个便是阿尔巴尼亚——希腊疆界问题。苏联代表团曾建议在协议上写着：阿尔巴尼亚与希腊彼此宣告现存阿希疆界是最后的疆界。有人曾对我们——苏联代表团——提出了两个几乎完全一样的抉择。他们建议说：阿尔巴尼亚与希腊应该在解决领土纠纷时不用武力，也不用武力的威胁。这是什么意思呢？这意思是：关于疆界的问题是可以争执的，而且将来还可能再返回来争执。苏联代表团认为关于阿希疆界的问题是无容争执的。
    大家知道，阿尔巴尼亚绝不要自希腊那里取得什么，而希腊却企图取得艾匹鲁斯北部，希腊政府曾对此一再发表声明。如果调解委员会不同意我们这种关于问题的说法，那就说明，调解委员会不愿表示反对希腊政府的领土要求。我们不能同意对问题的这种说法。
    纽约时报记者问：据塔斯社本年五月的报道，Ａ·葛罗米柯声称有两个问题未获解决。这便是关于希腊大赦与希腊全国选举的问题。您说现在有一个阿希问题。能否因而了解为：在其余的问题上没有分歧呢？
    维辛斯基答：关于疆界，我曾说这是重要的分歧问题之一。五月二十日所发表的葛罗米柯在纽约所提出的其他问题，还是以前那样。这些建议调解委员会也并未采取。这当然同样是很重要的分歧。但是我不知道调解委员会认为僵局的究竟是什么？
    电通社记者问：苏联政府对于建立希腊和平与民主的必需的基本条件的看法如何？
    维辛斯基答：这已在塔斯社一九四九年五月二十日所发表的我们的建议中加以说明。
    法新社记者问：是否可以从而了解为：苏联对希腊大赦及选举问题的立场是最后的和不能更改的，还是有方法在这些问题上达到协议呢？
    维辛斯基答：苏联的坚定立场，有如记者先生所说的，是最后的。至于达成协议的可能性，那就必须知道在怎样的基础上可以达成协议。
    关于中国在安理会中的代表性
    泛无线电通讯社记者问：能否允许我援引你原来关于安理会的发言，你在发言中谈到对于非常任理事国的地理上的代表性表示某些关怀。如果你认为这对于常任理事国来讲也是正确的话，而且由于苏联已经承认中国新政府，那么，苏联为什么不要求立即纠正安理会上关于中国的地理上的代表性？苏联为什么不提出这个问题？
    维辛斯基答：在我的一方面我却愿意发问：苏联为什么应该着急呢？一切事情都有它自己的时机。
    乐观需要什么
    国际新闻社记者（女）问：我对乐观感到兴趣。您可否告诉我世界依靠什么便可以在现时奠立乐观的基础。我认为一定的乐观对和平是必要的。
    维辛斯基答：当然有着乐观所必需的依据。而如果讲到联合国组织，那么在这里乐观并不需要许多东西，只要充分遵守若干基本规则就足够了：不插足自己的邻国，遵守联合国宪章，遵守君子协定，不策划幕后阴谋，不去伤害朋友。难道这还将不足以乐观吗？我认为，在这个基础上，是可以加强联合国组织并建立起各国间合理的合作的。我还没有说到拒斥新战争的宣传，尤其是新战争的准备，拒斥以炸弹相恐吓、特别是以原子弹相恐吓所需要的东西。真的，现在可以指出在这方面似乎有了某些转变。
    关于意大利对索马利兰托管问题
    黑人通讯社记者问：在今春和本届大会时，索马利兰青年组织的领导机关宣称：如果意大利将获得对索马利兰的托管权，那么索马利兰人民将起而反对并将抵抗到最后一个人。因为政治委员会若干委员声言要给意大利对索马利兰的托管权，那么，您或者苏联代表团是否认为索马利兰的情势是对和平的威胁呢？如果如此，那么这问题难道不属于安理会管辖而却属于政治委员会管辖吗？
    维辛斯基答：苏联在与这一或那一国家中民族解放运动相关的问题中，采取完全明白而确定的立场。我们此次会议的一位会员所提出的问题，即这个既属于安理会权限之内也属于政治委员会权限之内的问题，当然要求特别的研讨。大家知道：殖民强国对各民族的压迫，经常足以成为可以燃起战争大火的星星之火。
