Vyshinsky's Speech at the UN General Assembly
　　Opposing the Kuomintang's Provocations (Continued from yesterday's second edition)
　　The Kuomintang Bandit Gang is Rotten to the Core; Massive US Aid is Useless
　　The real reason for the collapse of the Kuomintang and its policies is frankly stated in the famous "White Paper" of the U.S. State Department. The statements of other highly authoritative representatives of the American ruling group also prove this point.

　　For example, The New York Times published a message on September 8 this year, relaying the words of Senator Connally, the chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Connally opposed further assistance to the Chinese Kuomintang government, saying that it was the head of that unadulterated Kuomintang government who abandoned the Chinese people, pocketed 138 million U.S. dollars worth of gold belonging to China, and fled to Taiwan. According to The New York Times, these words were indeed spoken by Senator Connally.

　　Let me quote a passage from the letter from the U.S. Secretary of State to President Truman attached to the "White Paper." This letter states that, in the opinion of many observers, the Kuomintang and its government were "corrupt, power-grabbing, and relied on the United States to win victories for them and maintain their own power at home."

　　This letter attached to the White Paper on the China issue states that these observers feared that the Kuomintang government was divorced from the people and proved unable to maintain its authority in the post-war period. The tense situation and war effort—as stated in this letter from the State Department—rapidly weakened the liberal elements participating in this government, while strengthening the reactionary groups indistinguishable from the feudal warlords of the past. The State Department's letter also admits that the Chinese people increasingly distrusted this government.

　　Everyone knows that during World War II, Chiang Kai-shek virtually ceased the war against the Japanese invaders. Because, according to American newspapers, after the United States entered the war, the Kuomintang was apparently convinced that Japan would eventually be defeated, and saw an opportunity to improve its own position in order to conduct a decisive struggle against the Communist Party.

　　Even the famous General Wedemeyer, in his report—also published in the White Paper—criticized the Kuomintang government for implementing autocratic police methods, and for its corruption and incompetence.

　　Are these not self-evident facts? Are they not enough to vividly portray the characteristics of this anti-Soviet "accuser's" camp? Are they not enough to explain what kind of gentlemen these are in terms of their moral traditions, their moral principles, and their political outlook, in terms of the cultural traditions that the Kuomintang representatives have babbled about here?

　　I must also quote The New York Times again, which published an article in April this year entitled "The Ebb in China"? This article stated: The people of Kuomintang China—that is, Chiang Kai-shek's China—have been demoralized after twenty years of war. Inflation has deprived every Chinese person of even the most essential necessities. The people saw that in the three years of war, corruption and reaction had undermined the vitality of their country. During this period, the United States gave the Kuomintang three billion U.S. dollars in military and other aid.

　　The New York Times stated that it believed that 90 percent of the two billion U.S. dollars in military aid ultimately went to the Communist Party.

　　The New York Times wrote that American supplies fell into the hands of the People's Revolutionary Army so quickly that the Chinese Communist Party called Chiang Kai-shek the "transportation captain."

　　In this regard, the New York Herald Tribune was not far behind The New York Times. On April 16 this year, the newspaper published an article stating that Secretary of State Acheson believed that the Communist Party would be able to take all of China. The article stated that it believed that 80 percent of the military supplies sent to China by the United States were now in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party.

　　Such is the situation regarding the source of weapons for the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

　　However, the Kuomintang government, by means of slander, has attempted to make it appear as if the Soviet Union helped the People's Liberation Army in its struggle against the Kuomintang government.

　　In light of the undeniable facts stated above, the question arises: What does all of this have to do with the Soviet Union? What does the Soviet Union have to do with interfering in China's internal affairs? What does it have to do with violating the United Nations Charter? What does it have to do with violating the Sino-Soviet Treaty? What does it have to do with the threat to China's political independence and territorial integrity that the Kuomintang representatives have been chattering about here?
　　　　
　　　The Kuomintang's Despicable Proposal Should Not Be Included on the UN General Assembly's Agenda
　　Even based on the short passage I just spoke, which no one can refute, isn't it clear that this deceptive trick of the Kuomintang is a political ploy? Isn't it clear that this issue, as I have said, has been forcibly brought up and intentionally raised to achieve purposes that are completely different from the tasks and objectives of the United Nations? This deceptive trick has absolutely no logical, factual, or any other legal basis. The Kuomintang government has said a lot of false things here, and the purpose it wants to achieve is not those formally declared here, but some purposes that are completely different from what it has formally stated, as I have already said. The Kuomintang government is desperately trying to show—if not prove, because it will definitely not be able to prove—that this government can still be used, can still be driven by the reactionary aggressive camp to oppose the democratic and progressive camp.

　　The reason why I must stand here to firmly oppose forcing the General Assembly to consider the Kuomintang's thoroughly provocative and defamatory statement is here.

　　I cannot hide some of the anxieties that are occurring here now. Everyone knows, and there has long been private talk circulating in the General Assembly, that there are some tense behind-the-scenes activities regarding the Kuomintang's anti-Soviet remarks, and that the Kuomintang is acting under the protection and direct instigation of certain powerful countries.

　　I must state this publicly so that the General Assembly will not take a credulous attitude towards this matter, towards this provocation, the result of which will be to allow the United Nations to be used as a tool for carrying out political tricks, as a tool for pursuing hidden purposes that are completely different from the purposes of the United Nations.

　　Now, the Kuomintang government, representatives of the declining Chinese warlords, who are still in the hands of a bankrupt ruling group in a part of China, want you to participate in this crude and filthy provocative conspiracy.

　　Including the Chinese proposal on the agenda can have no other meaning than to encourage the anti-Soviet slander campaign.

　　Therefore, I ask the General Assembly to reject this despicable plot by the Kuomintang government representative. I insist that the defamatory and provocative matter proposed by the Kuomintang government and its protectors not be included on the agenda. (The End)

### 维辛斯基在联大演说　反对国民党挑衅（续昨日二版）

　　维辛斯基在联大演说
  　反对国民党挑衅（续昨日二版）
  　国民党匪帮腐烂达极点美帝大量援助也不顶事
    国民党及其政策的垮台的真正原因，在美国国务院的著名的“白皮书”中说得很坦白。美国统治集团其他十分权威的代表们的言论，也证明了这一点。
    举例说，今年九月八日的纽约时报登载一条消息，转述了美国参院外交委员会主席著名参议员康纳利的话。康纳利反对进一步帮助中国国民党政府，他说，正是那位不折不扣的国民党政府的元首抛弃了中国人民，把属于中国的价值一亿三千八百万美元的黄金纳入腰包，逃到了台湾。据纽约时报的消息说，这些话确确实实是参议员康纳利讲的。
    让我引一段美国国务卿附于“白皮书”内致杜鲁门总统的信。这封信说，按照许多观察家的意见，国民党及其政府“贪污腐化，争权夺利，依靠美国为他们取得胜利而保持他们自己在国内的权势”。
    这封附于关于中国问题的白皮书内的信说，这些观察家担心国民党政府脱离人民，并在战后时期中证明不能维持其权威。紧张的形势和战争努力——象国务院这封信内所说的——迅速削弱了参加这个政府的自由主义分子，而加强了与过去封建军阀毫无区别的反动派集团。国务院的信并承认中国人民群众愈来愈不信任这个政府。
    大家都知道，在第二次世界大战期间，蒋介石实际上停止了对日本侵入者的战争。因为，据美国报纸的消息说，在美国参战之后，国民党显然确信日本最后一定失败，看到有了改善本身地位以对共产党进行决定性斗争的机会。
    就连著名的魏德迈将军，在他的报告—也发表于白皮书内——中也责备国民党政府实行专制的警察办法，责备它的贪污腐化和颟顸无能。
    这些难道还不是不言自明的事实吗？难道还不足以生动地刻划出这个反苏“控诉者”的阵营的特色吗？还不足以说明这些绅士们从其道德传统、从其道德原则和他们的政治面貌来看，从国民党代表们在这里胡诌了一通的文化传统来看，是什么样子的吗？
    我还得再引一下纽约时报，该报今年四月不是登过一篇文章，题目叫“中国的高潮”吗？这篇文章说：国民党中国的——即是蒋介石中国的——人民，经过了二十年的战争，民气已经败坏。通货膨胀使每一个中国老百姓丧失了甚至最要紧的必需品。人民看到，在三年的战争中间，贪污腐化和反动已破坏了他们国家的元气。在这个时期，美国给了国民党三十亿美元的军事和其他援助。
    纽约时报说，相信二十亿美元的军事援助中有百分之九十最后为共产党所得。
    纽约时报写道，美国的供应如此迅速地落入人民革命军队之手，以至中国共产党把蒋介石叫作“运输队长”。
    在这点上，纽约先驱论坛报也不落后于纽约时报。该报今年四月十六日登了一篇文章说，国务卿艾奇逊相信共产党能够取得全中国。该文说，相信，美国送到中国去的军事供应中有百分之八十现在在中国共产党手里。
    中国人民解放军武器的来源，情形就是如此。
    但是，国民党政府用诬蔑办法，企图把事情说成好象苏联帮助了人民解放军反对国民党政府的斗争。
    从以上所述无可争辩的事实看来，问题就发生了：所有这一切与苏联何干？苏联与干涉中国内政有什么关系？与违犯联合国宪章有什么关系？与违犯中苏条约又有什么关系？与国民党代表在这里呶呶不休地说对中国政治独立与领土完整的威胁又有什么关系？
    　　　　国民党的卑鄙建议联大不应列入议程
    即使就从我刚才说过的这短短的一段谁也反驳不了的话来看，国民党的这个欺骗勾当是一个政治诡计。这个问题如我所说过的是被牵强附会地提出来的，是为了要达到与联合国的任务和宗旨毫不相同的目的而故意提出来的，难道还不明白吗？这个欺骗勾当绝对没有逻辑的、事实的或其他任何法律的根据。国民党政府在这里说了一通虚妄的话，它所要达到的目的，并不是在这里正式声明的那些，而是我已经说过的和它所正式讲的完全不相同的一些目的。国民党政府拼命地想要表现一下——如果不是证明一下的话，要证明它是一定办不到的——这个政府还能供使用，还能供反动侵略阵营驱使来反对民主进步阵营。
    我所以必须要在这里提出来坚决反对强迫大会考虑国民党澈头澈尾挑衅和诽谤的声明，原因就在这里。
    我不能掩盖现在这里发生的一些焦虑。大家都知道，而且在大会上早已流传着一种私下的闲谈，说关于国民党的反苏言论有一些紧张的幕后活动，说国民党是在某些有势力的国家庇护和直接指使之下行事的。
    我不能不公开这样说明，以便使大会不要对这件事情，对这个挑衅采取轻信的态度，这个挑衅的结果，将使联合国被利用为进行政治诡计的工具，利用为追求与联合国的宗旨毫不相同的不可告人的目的的工具。
    现在，国民党政府，没落的中国军阀，仍然在他们手中的一部分中国的破了产的统治集团的代表，要你们参加这个粗暴而龌龊的挑衅阴谋。
    将中国建议列入议程，除了鼓励仇苏诽谤运动之外，不可能有其他的意义。
    因此，我要求大会驳回国民党政府代表的这个卑鄙图谋。我坚持不要将国民党政府及其保护者所建议增添这个诽谤的挑衅的事项列入议程。（完）
