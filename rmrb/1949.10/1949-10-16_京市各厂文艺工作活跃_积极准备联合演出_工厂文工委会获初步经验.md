　　Active Literary and Art Work in Beijing Factories
  　Actively Preparing for Joint Performances
  　Factory Literary and Art Work Committee Gains Initial Experience
    [Beijing News] The Beijing Municipal Factory Literary and Art Work Committee is intensifying its factory literary and art work. On the one hand, it is cooperating with the Municipal Workers' Club to organize various literary and art activities, organize drama evenings and exhibitions, etc. On the other hand, it has organized more than 60 literary and art cadres from the city to work in factories. Therefore, in the past 20 days, the cultural and recreational work of various factories has been initially developed. The Factory Literary and Art Work Committee is jointly formed by the Factory Literary and Art Work Group of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee's Cultural Committee, the Literary and Art Department of the Municipal Youth Committee, and the Propaganda and Education Department of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions. It unifies the leadership of factory literary and art work and assigns cadres to organize guidance, creation, and performance in a planned and step-by-step manner. The main work plan of the committee is: (1) To cooperate with the work of the Municipal Workers' Club, to run training courses in drama, music, literature, etc., as well as various literary and art lectures and exhibitions, and to organize drama evenings and establish workers' theaters, etc. (2) To allocate a large number of literary and art work cadres to factories to assist in organizing clubs, singing teams, Yangko teams, sports teams, and communication groups, etc. Therefore, at the end of September, 61 literary and art work cadres were assigned to the 70th Arsenal, Clothing Factory, Renli Carpet Company, Xinhua Printing Factory, Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant and Power Plant, Qinghe Woolen Mill, Changxindian Machinery Factory, Housheng Match Company, Mentougou Chengzi Mine, People's Printing Factory, Telecommunications Bureau, and other 12 factories for guidance work. Workers' clubs and singing teams in units such as the 70th Arsenal, People's Printing Factory, Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, and Clothing Factory have been established successively, and the drama troupes of various factories are also actively rehearsing plays in preparation for demonstration performances. For example, the 70th Arsenal has rehearsed a new play "Production is One Inch Longer." Workers' creation and communication are also enthusiastically reorganized under the encouragement and inspiration of factory comrades. They are now actively preparing to participate in the selection competition to welcome the Asian-Australian Trade Union Representative Conference performance. The main experiences gained in this work are: (1) The four aspects of administration, trade union, party branch, and League branch must cooperate appropriately to unify and strengthen the leadership to carry out factory literary and art work. In particular, the cooperation of the Communist Youth League is very important. For example, the Communist Youth League members of factories such as Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, People's Printing Factory, and Qinghe Woolen Mill have played a very important role in the work. Therefore, relying on the Communist Youth League as the center and relying on League members and activists to unite workers is the best way out for factory literature and art. (2) It is necessary to patiently mobilize the masses from the bottom up, encourage and unite the workers, so that they attach importance to cultural and recreational activities and organize them to participate actively. (3) In factories where the administration and trade union do not pay enough attention to cultural and recreational work, the cadres of the Literary and Art Work Committee who go to the factories should use concrete work to actively contact them and gain their trust, so as to develop the work.

　　京市各厂文艺工作活跃
  　积极准备联合演出
  　工厂文工委会获初步经验
    【北京讯】北京市工厂文艺工作委员会，加紧开展工厂文艺工作。一方面配合市工人俱乐部筹办各种文艺活动、组织戏剧晚会及展览会等，一方面曾组织了本市文艺干部六十余人到工厂工作，因此二十余天来，各个工厂的文娱工作，都得到了初步的开展。工厂文艺工作委员会是由中共北京市委文委工厂文艺工作组、市青委文艺部及市总工会宣教部联合组成，统一领导工厂文艺工作，并有计划有步骤地配备干部作辅导、创作、演出的组织工作。该会的工作计划主要是：（一）配合市工人俱乐部的工作，开办戏剧、音乐、文学等训练班以及各种文艺讲座、文艺展览会，并组织戏剧晚会，建立工人剧场等。（二）配备大批文艺工作干部到工厂协助组织俱乐部、歌咏队、秧歌队、体育队、通讯组等，因此在九月底六十一位文艺工作干部分别到七十兵工厂、被服厂、仁立地毯公司、新华印刷厂、石景山炼钢厂及发电厂、清河制呢厂、长辛店机厂、厚生火柴公司、门头沟城子矿、人民印刷厂、电信总局等十二个工厂，作辅导工作。七十兵工厂、人民印刷厂、石景山钢铁厂、被服厂等单位的工人俱乐部、歌咏队均已相继建立，各厂的剧团也积极的排戏，准备示范演出。如七十兵工厂已排好新戏“生产长一寸”。工人创作、通讯也在工厂同志们的鼓励与启发下，热情的重新振奋的组织起来了。现正积极准备参加迎接亚澳职工代表会议演出的选拔竞赛。在这段工作中，所获主要经验是：（一）行政、工会、党的支部、团的支部四方面要适当的配合，以便统一的强有力的领导开展工厂文艺工作。特别是青年团的配合非常重要。如石景山钢铁厂、人民印刷厂、清河制呢厂等厂的青年团员，在工作中起了极大的作用，因此依靠青年团为中心，依靠团员与积极分子来团结工人是工厂文艺的最好出路。（二）要有耐心的自下而上发动群众，鼓励并团结工人，使他们重视文娱活动，并组织他们积极参加。（三）在行政与工会不够重视文娱工作的工厂中，文工会到工厂的干部要用具体工作，主动与他们联系，并取得他们的信任，以便工作的开展。
