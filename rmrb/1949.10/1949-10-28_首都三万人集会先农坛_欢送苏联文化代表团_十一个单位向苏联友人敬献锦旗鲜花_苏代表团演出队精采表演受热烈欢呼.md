Over 30,000 people from all walks of life in the capital held a grand rally at the Temple of Agriculture at 2:00 PM today to warmly bid farewell to the Soviet cultural, artistic, and scientific workers delegation which is about to return home. High above the rostrum were hung the national flags of China and the Soviet Union, along with large portraits of Chairman Mao Zedong and Marshal Stalin. As Simonov led the members of the Soviet delegation into the venue, the entire audience rose to their feet, applauding and cheering enthusiastically. The farewell rally began with the solemn playing of the national anthems of China and the Soviet Union. First, Mayor Nie Rongzhen delivered a farewell speech on behalf of the people of all circles in Beijing. Mayor Nie pointed out: The arrival of the Soviet cultural delegation in our country has enabled the Chinese people to further recognize the profound friendship of the Soviet Union towards the Chinese people and the excellent socialist culture of the Soviet Union. Mayor Nie called for further strengthening the friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union in the future and striving to learn from the Soviet Union. Then, delegation leader Simonov delivered a speech. In his speech, Simonov praised the workers, peasants, intellectuals, commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, women, and students of New China for actively building a new China and warmly expressed that after returning to the Soviet Union, he would tell the Soviet people about the great and heroic deeds of New China. Simonov said: "We want to tell the Soviet people that we saw millions of friendly eyes here, facing the Soviet Union, facing the great Soviet people... We want to consolidate and develop the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people. This friendship has a great past, a great present, and it will face an even greater future." After Simonov finished his speech, the Beijing Municipal People's Government, the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and representatives of various people's organizations, a total of eleven units, presented the delegation with two banners inscribed with "Long Live Sino-Soviet Friendship" and "Long Live Sino-Soviet Cooperation," as well as flowers and various gifts. At that moment, the venue shouted: "Long Live Sino-Soviet Friendship!" "Long Live Sino-Soviet Cooperation!" "Long Live Chairman Mao!" "Long Live Marshal Stalin!" and other slogans, and applauded and cheered to their hearts' content.
