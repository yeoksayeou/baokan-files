Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 17th: Since late September, many cities in North China have held people's representative conferences. Materials received here include those from Qinhuangdao, Tongxian, Handan, and Dingxian in Hebei Province; Xinxiang in Pingyuan Province; Yangquan and Taiyuan in Shanxi Province; and Zhangjiakou and Yanggao in Chahar Province. Among these, Taiyuan and Zhangjiakou held their second conferences. Through these meetings, significant current construction issues in each city were discussed and resolved, strengthening the ties between the People's Government and the broad masses. The Taiyuan conference focused on discussing the issue of strengthening material exchange throughout the province to promote industrial and agricultural development. Representatives provided many valuable suggestions, such as proposing the manufacturing of new agricultural tools and chemical fertilizers, organizing rural inspection groups to understand farmers' needs, and planning organized transportation and sales. The Zhangjiakou conference seriously discussed the three major issues urgently needing resolution in the city: universal household registration and elimination of bandits and special agents, public health, and labor-capital relations. The Yangquan representative conference, based on local characteristics, focused on discussing the restoration of the coal and iron mining industries, passing resolutions to prioritize the restoration of state-owned coal mines while also paying attention to supporting the restoration of private medium-sized coal mines along the railway line, and strictly prohibiting the chaotic opening of small kilns. The Qinhuangdao city conference conducted a lively discussion on labor-capital issues, unanimously passing a draft of measures for handling labor-capital relations and establishing four specialized problem research committees on tax revenue, rent, and other issues, to respectively study various proposals and offer constructive opinions.

　　Generally, the representatives from various regions were able to offer suggestions and ideas in the spirit of "knowing everything and saying everything," and sincerely and frankly offered criticisms and suggestions for improvement regarding certain shortcomings in the government's work and the style of cadres. For example, one representative from Taiyuan suggested: "There is a lack of currency in rural areas, and farmers want to exchange grain for some necessities, but some places do not allow food grains to leave the area, which is very bad." Due to the full promotion of democratic practices, the Taiyuan People's Representative Conference proposed a total of 110 proposals, of which 34 were about unblocking urban-rural trade and promoting economic prosperity. The conference treated these opinions with a serious and responsible attitude, studying them separately and handing them over to relevant departments for processing.

　　The representatives attending the conferences in various regions included people from all classes, industries, and sectors. For example, among the 105 representatives attending the Xinxiang City conference, there were 34 workers, 12 representatives from various industries, 15 representatives of teachers and students, 4 farmers, 8 citizens, 2 Hui people, 21 representatives from Party, government, and military organs, and 4 representatives from the military. The representatives of the current Taiyuan conference were all newly elected, including representatives from various democratic parties, democratic personages, workers, suburban farmers, young students, women, citizens from various districts and streets, industrial and commercial circles, cultural and educational circles, guard troops, ethnic minorities, and representatives from various organizations and groups, totaling 180 people. This situation gave the conferences in various regions extremely broad representation, allowing people from all walks of life to have the opportunity to listen to government reports and express their opinions, and enabling the government to gain powerful assistants in carrying out its work.

　　In order to implement the spirit and resolutions of the People's Representative Conferences, various regions paid attention to organizing post-conference work. After the closing of the People's Representative Conferences in cities such as Zhangjiakou, Tangshan, and Qinhuangdao, the local Party committees, People's Governments, and representatives all seriously cooperated in making arrangements, conveying information, and conducting propaganda. At the closing of the Taiyuan representative conference, specific arrangements were made for post-conference tasks and methods of conveying conference resolutions. After the Zhangjiakou City conference, three districts have separately formulated propaganda plans, and some districts have used various meetings, night schools, literacy classes, and other forms to convey the resolutions of the conference. Wu Wenpu, a military family representative from the third district of the city, and Zhang Haishan, a military family representative from the first district, both convened symposiums for military families in their respective districts to convey the spirit of the People's Representative Conference and unanimously proposed that military families must try their best to support themselves through labor in order to help the public solve difficulties. After listening to the criticisms of the People's Representatives against the government and its staff, the Qinhuangdao Municipal Committee immediately convened a general meeting of all Party members, where the Secretary of the Municipal Committee, Wang Shiyu, personally conducted a self-criticism report. The Municipal Committee also decided that all Party member cadres should carry out a major inspection of policies, ideology, and work style. The Tangshan Municipal People's Government also held a government affairs meeting after the representative conference to discuss ways to implement the resolutions of the People's Representative Conference. Through these propagations, conveyances, and reports, the spirit of the People's Representative Conference has gradually been promoted to the broad masses, strengthening the ties between the People's Government and the people.

　　华北许多城市先后召开
  　各界人民代表会议
    密切人民政府与群众的联系
    【新华社北京十七日电】九月下旬以来，华北许多城市都已经召开各界人民代表会议。此间已收到材料的计有河北省的秦皇岛、通县、邯郸、定县，平原省的新乡，山西省的阳泉、太原、察哈尔的张家口、阳高等城市，其中太原和张家口是二届会议。经过这些会议，商讨并解决了各该城市当前建设上的各种重大问题，密切了人民政府与广大群众的联系。太原的会议，集中讨论了加强全省物资交流以促进工农业发展的问题。代表们提供了许多宝贵意见，如提议多制造新的农具和化学肥料，组织农村考察团，了解农民需要，有计划地组织运销等。张家口的会议，则认真地讨论了该市当前迫切需要解决的普查户口肃清匪特、公共卫生、劳资关系等三大问题。阳泉代表会议根据当地特点着重讨论了煤、铁矿业的恢复问题，会议通过以恢复国营煤矿为主，同时并注意扶助铁路沿线的私人中等煤矿的恢复，严禁乱开小窑。秦皇岛市的会议对劳资问题进行了热烈讨论，一致通过了劳资关系处理办法草案，并成立了税收、房租等四个专门问题研究委员会，分别研究各项提案，提出建设性意见。
    各地的代表们一般都能本着“知无不言，言无不尽”的精神，出主意想办法，并对政府工作中的某些缺点及干部作风等，诚恳坦白地提出批评和改进意见。如太原一位代表提出：“农村货币缺乏，农民想以粮食换些必需品，但有些地方不让食粮出境，这样很不好。”由于充分发扬了民主作风，太原各界代表会议共提议案一百零一件，其中有三十四件都是关于沟通城乡贸易、繁荣经济的提案。大会对这些意见均以严肃负责的态度，分别研究并交有关部门处理。
    出席各地会议的代表，包括了各阶层、各行业、各界的人物。如新乡市到会代表一百零五人中，有工人三十四人，各行业代表十二人，教职员学生代表十五人，农民四人，市民八人，回民二人，党政军机关代表二十一人，部队代表四人。太原这届会议的代表，均系重新选举，包括各民主党派、民主人士、工人、郊区农民、青年学生、妇女、各区街市民、工商业界、文化教育界、警卫部队、少数民族及各机关团体代表共一百八十人。这种情况，使各地会议有了极其广泛的代表性，使各界人民得到了听取政府报告与发表意见的机会，并使政府在进行工作中获得了有力的助手。
    为了把各界人民代表会议的精神和决议贯彻下去，各地都注意组织会议以后的工作。张家口、唐山、秦皇岛等城市，在各界代表会议闭幕后，中共党委、人民政府及各代表，都认真地协同进行布置、传达和宣传。太原代表会议闭幕时，具体布置了会后任务和传达会议决议的办法。张家口市会后有三个区已分别拟定宣传计划，有的区则利用各种会议、夜校、识字班等形式，传达大会的决议。该市三区军属代表吴文普、一区军属代表张海山，都召开了本区的军属座谈会，传达各界代表会的精神，并一致提出：军人家属们一定要尽可能地靠自己劳动过时光，以便帮助公家解决困难。秦皇岛市委听取了各界代表对政府及工作人员的批评后，立即召开了全体党员大会，市委书记王世煜亲自进行了检讨报告，市委并决定全体党员干部开展政策、思想、作风大检查。唐山市人民政府亦在代表会后举行了政务会议，商讨执行各界代表会决议办法。经过这些宣传、传达和报告，使各界代表会的精神逐渐推广到广大群众中去，密切了人民政府与人民群众的联系。
