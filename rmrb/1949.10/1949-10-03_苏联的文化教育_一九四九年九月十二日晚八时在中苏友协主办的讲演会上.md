Friends,

Today is the second day of the lecture series organized by the Preparatory Committee of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and I am asked to talk about the culture and education of the Soviet Union. I must state that the Soviet Union's cultural construction is very extensive in its departments and scope. Today, I can only provide a very simple introduction.

The Soviet Union is a new type of country. It is different from other countries in Europe, Asia, and the Americas in politics, economics, military affairs, and culture. In the Soviet Union, there is no longer a system of people exploiting people or people oppressing people. All oppressors and exploiters have been eliminated. Its politics are not the politics of a few oppressing the majority, but the democratic politics of the whole people; its military is not for the power struggles of a few ambitious individuals or warlords, and not for invading other countries or nations, but for defending all the people and defending against foreign aggression; its economy is not for a few people to make fortunes and money, but for the entire people to seek a happy life of abundance.

The Great October Revolution is now nearly thirty-two years old. The Soviet Union has undergone revolution and the armed intervention and destruction by fourteen imperialist powers, and everything needs to be rebuilt. So, is the Soviet Union's cultural construction lagging behind? No, the Soviet Union's cultural construction was given attention very early on. Lenin, the mentor of the revolution, once said: In the early days of the revolution's success, the main task was to defeat the resistance of the bourgeoisie and smash the armed intervention and sabotage conspiracies of the foreign bourgeoisie. But another task became more urgent with the passage of time, and that was the essential task of building communism, the task of cultural construction. Therefore, after the success of the revolution, the Chairman of the People's Soviet, Lenin, immediately ordered the protection of cultural facilities and historical relics, forbidding destruction. Schools were reopened and transformed. Later, various measures were taken, first to eliminate illiteracy, and then to vigorously develop school education and social and cultural education. Therefore, the Soviet Union's cultural construction was able to develop as rapidly as its military, political, and economic affairs.

Before the war, Stalin's three five-year plans all needed culture as a foundation. Now I will briefly talk about what these three five-year plans were: The first five-year plan was national industrialization, that is, transforming from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country. (Our Chairman Mao has also repeatedly said that if we want China to be independent, progressive, prosperous, and happy, we must also transform from an agricultural country into an industrial country.) The Soviet Union's second five-year plan was agricultural collectivization. Farmers are scattered and unorganized, which is the same in China and foreign countries, but only agricultural collectivization can increase harvests, because collective farms use tractors to cultivate the land, use machines to sow seeds, and use combines to harvest. This not only saves manpower, but also increases yields. The first and second five-year plans are connected. After industrialization, there will be machine tractor stations, which can then have collective farms. But the realization of the two five-year plans equally requires culture as a foundation. If people do not understand culture, to put it simply, how can machines be operated? How can publicity and introduction be carried out?

If there are no measures such as compulsory education to protect culture, it is clear that the five-year plan will be difficult to implement.

If cultural education played a big role in the first and second five-year plans, then the task of cultural construction in the third five-year plan will be even more important. The third five-year plan is to transform the Soviet Union from a socialist country to a communist country. In addition to further increasing productivity, it also requires further improvement in culture, education, science, and art. Because for thousands of years, human society has always been a society of people exploiting people, and the poison in people's minds is very deep. Communist society requires that everyone's minds be transformed, and that the remnants of capitalism be eliminated from psychology, spirit, and ideology, so that everyone becomes a communist. Therefore, the role of cultural education is particularly great in the third five-year plan.

Unfortunately, this third five-year plan was not completed before Hitler's Germany launched the war. At this time, the Soviet Union had to concentrate all its forces to deal with the invaders and defend the motherland. But it should be known that the Soviet Union's cultural education played a great role in winning the great war against the German bandits. The Soviet Union's victory over fascist Germany was due to the bravery of the Soviet army, due to the wise strategic command of Marshal Stalin, but also due to the fact that the Soviet people were different from other people. They received different education, had different minds. Every Soviet person loved their motherland, and their hearts were filled with the enthusiasm of new patriotism. They were able to fight such a victorious battle. On the other hand, Hitler's German army was uncultured, they were just machines, they didn't know why they were fighting. Fascism dislikes culture, hates culture, and even fears culture. After Hitler's Germany was defeated, the Soviet army returned east in a matter of months and defeated the elite of the Japanese army, the Kwantung Army, in one fell swoop. This was also the effect of the Soviet people's education, because the Soviet people and army understood their mission. In addition to eliminating the hotbed of war in the West, they must also eliminate the hotbed of war in the East, Japanese imperialism, so that the world can have peace and mankind can be liberated.

After the end of the war, the Soviet Union began to implement the post-war five-year plan.

I have been to the Soviet Union twice this year. From what I have seen, the Soviet Union has not only completely restored its pre-war construction, but has also greatly exceeded it. Life and culture in all aspects are many times higher than what I have seen before. It can be definitely said that the Soviet Union is now the most culturally and educationally developed country in the world.

The current education in the Soviet Union is for all the people. All school-age children must study, that is to say, education is compulsory. Compulsory education is seven years in cities and four years in rural areas. This means that all Soviet people are at least elementary school graduates or junior high school graduates, and can write letters, read newspapers, and read books. In the old Russia, in 1913, all the higher schools, including universities and colleges, numbered only ninety-one, with only 112,000 college students; now there are more than eight hundred higher schools, with 730,000 college students, more than the total number of college students in other European countries combined. There are more than three thousand middle schools with more than one million students, and more than three thousand elementary schools with more than thirty million students. In addition, there are 270,000 students in correspondence schools.

In addition, many backward ethnic groups in the old Russia, who had no schools or written language at that time, now all speak their own languages, use their own writing, and use it to educate their children. All ethnic minorities publish books in their own languages, and it is completely legal for ethnic minorities to write submissions to the Supreme Soviet in their own languages. National oppression has been completely eliminated, and the culture of all ethnic groups has been fully developed.

Before the Soviet revolution, there were only three thousand natural scientists in all of Russia. Now there are more than 100,000, including 30,000 to 40,000 university professors, doctors, lecturers, and masters. They use Marxist-Leninist viewpoints, the most progressive viewpoints, to study all departments of science, and their achievements are the highest in the world.

Now let's talk about the general culture of the Soviet Union.

The general culture of the Soviet Union is the highest in the world. I can talk about this principle. There is an old Chinese saying: "Only when clothing and food are sufficient will etiquette and righteousness flourish." Now, which country in the world has people who, like the Soviet people, do not worry about the problem of eating, clothing, and working? In the Soviet Union, students do not worry about going to school, college graduates do not worry about work, and everyone does not worry about clothing, food, and housing. On such a material foundation, naturally everyone can learn culture. In the United States and other capitalist countries, only a few people have culture. Having culture is good for getting promoted and making money. Their children are educated also for the purpose of getting promoted and making money again. The working masses, who are called "lower people," are too busy worrying about eating, clothing, and work to have the opportunity to learn culture. At the same time, capitalist countries are afraid of workers having high culture. If workers have high culture, they will become aware and will resist. Capitalists only dare to let workers have a little culture to use machines. Socialist countries are not afraid of people having high culture, the higher the better. The higher the culture, the better the production, the happier the people's lives, and everyone can have a very high culture. The cultural development of socialist countries is unlimited, which is fundamentally different from capitalist countries. Therefore, I say that the general culture of the Soviet Union is the highest, and this is based on evidence.

In addition to schools, there are many facilities for social education in the Soviet Union. Every city in the Soviet Union has a cultural palace, which contains libraries, reading rooms, clubs, concert halls, stadiums, etc. Every worker or student can go in for legitimate entertainment or reading after work and during rest. Every city has a cultural rest park, and there are many libraries and reading rooms. The number of cinemas and theaters exceeds that of any other country. In Moscow alone, there are twenty-one cultural palaces. An open-air theater in Gorky Cultural Learning Park can accommodate tens of thousands of people; there are 152 employee clubs, all of which are inside factories. In the clubs, workers can listen to lectures, watch plays or movies, read books, exercise... There are also 2,300 libraries and sixty museums, and this is only in Moscow. Other cities have such facilities, and even a small station can see library and reading room facilities.

In rural areas, there are a total of 100,000 clubs, 400 cultural palaces, and 20,000 cinemas. The Soviet Union attaches great importance to sports. There are now 600 of the best stadiums in the country, and 17,000 ordinary ones, 9,000 ski resorts, and 500 large swimming pools.

I would like to talk specifically about the culture of Soviet workers.

Every factory in the Soviet Union has cultural facilities, worker's children's schools, and adult worker's remedial classes to improve the cultural level of workers. I have been to the homes of several workers and have seen it, and it is simply hard to believe that these are workers' dormitories. Once, I went to the home of a Stakhanovite worker and saw that his home had three rooms: a bedroom, a study, and a reception room and dining room. I asked him what he did after work, and he said that he watched movies, watched plays, read books, and read newspapers. His monthly income was more than 10,000 rubles, his material life was abundant, and his cultural level was naturally improved. This is a skilled technician. In addition, I once talked to a driver on a long-distance bus. That driver read a lot of books and could talk endlessly about various schools of thought in academia. Another time, I met an old man and a young man on the train arguing about which was the best between Sholokhov's "Quiet Don" and "Virgin Soil Upturned." Later, I learned that the old man was an accountant at the railway bureau, and the young man was a worker at a steel plant. From this, we can see the general cultural level of Soviet employees.

Soviet literature and art are extremely brilliant. Before the revolution, the realism of Russian literature was profound, and its position in the world was very high. After the revolution, Soviet writers inherited this excellent tradition and carried it forward. Soviet literature and art all have deep educational significance, unlike the boredom of bourgeois works. Drama and movies can enable people to discover problems and solve problems, unlike the decadence and corruption of American movies. There are many Soviet writers, especially in recent years many new writers have won Stalin Prizes. We in China have translated many Soviet works. When we were in Yan'an, we investigated a school where the vast majority of more than 500 students went to the revolution because they read works by Russian writers such as Gorky. Now, I think there are also many young people in Beijing who have changed their outlook on life and participated in revolutionary work because they have read the works of Soviet writers. The artistry, political nature, and ideological nature of Soviet literary and artistic works are high. As Stalin said, "The writer is the engineer of the human soul," and this can be known from this sentence.

Summarizing what has been said above, I would like to point out three characteristics of Soviet culture and education:

First, Soviet culture is for the masses, and it is the masses' own. Soviet culture and education are constantly rising. Now the Soviet workers and peasants have become intellectualized. Every Soviet worker and peasant has knowledge, and many university professors and higher intellectuals are of worker and peasant origin.

Second, patriotism. Soviet culture and education oppose cosmopolitanism that forgets its roots, loves and values its own nation's history and cultural heritage, opposes the decadent and corrupt culture of Western Europe and the United States, and opposes blindly worshiping everything foreign. (The Kuomintang reactionaries are a group that slavishly worships the corrupt and foul American culture.)

Third, internationalism. Internationalism opposes narrow nationalism. Narrow nationalism opposes everything of other nations, and also wants to invade and oppress others. Internationalists often regard the governments of imperialist countries and the people of these countries separately, and oppose the governments of imperialism and oppose their aggression. This is patriotism. Supporting the people of all countries who are fighting for democracy and freedom, and treating them as their own brothers, is internationalism. The Soviet government and the people are one, and the people and the government support and assist all oppressed and invaded people, so our attitude towards the Soviet Union and towards imperialist and other countries (separating the people and the government) cannot be the same.

The patriotic spirit of Soviet culture and education enabled it to defeat Germany and liberate itself; the internationalist spirit of Soviet culture and education enabled it to help Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary... gain liberation from fascist German enslavement, and defeated Japan in the Far East, enabling the people of North Korea and Northeast China to be liberated. At the end of June this year, when I passed through Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, I saw several large wooden boards on the streets of Kiev with victory pictures of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The cities that had been liberated were marked with small flags and lit up with light bulbs every day. Many people looked at the map and showed great pleasure. From this, we can also see the Soviet people's concern for the liberation of the Chinese people and the expression of their internationalist spirit.

We must learn Soviet culture, and we must learn the Soviet people's highly conscious, comprehensive, popular, national, scientific, mass, patriotic, and internationalist culture and education.

　　苏联的文化教育
    一九四九年九月十二日晚八时在中苏友协主办的讲演会上
    萧三讲
    各位朋友们：
    今天是中苏友协总会筹委会举办讲演会的第二天，要我来讲讲苏联的文化教育问题。我应当声明，苏联的文化建设，部门非常之多，范围非常之广，我今天只能作非常简单的介绍。
    苏联是新式国家，它无论在政治、经济、军事、文化，那一方面，和欧洲、亚洲、美洲的其他国家不同，在苏联已经没有人剥削人，人压迫人的制度，已经消灭了所有的压迫者和剥削者。它的政治不是少数人压迫多数人的政治，而是全民的民主政治；它的军事不是为了少数野心家少数军阀争权夺利的，不是侵略别的国家民族的，而是保卫全体人民，防御外国侵略的；它的经济不是为少数人发财赚钱，而是为全体人民谋丰衣足食的幸福的生活。
    伟大的十月革命到现在已经将近三十二年了。苏联经过革命和十四个帝国主义的武力干涉、破坏，一切都要建设。那么是不是苏联的文化建设很落后呢？不是，苏联的文化建设很早就被注意了，革命的导师列宁曾说过：在革命成功的初期，主要任务是战胜资产阶级的抵抗，粉碎外国资产阶级的武装干涉及破坏阴谋。但另一个任务随着时间的进展就更迫切地提了出来，这就是建设共产主义的本质的任务，文化建设的任务。所以革命成功以后，人民苏维埃主席列宁立刻命令保护文化设备，文物纪念，不得破坏，学校复课并改造。以后又采取了种种措施，首先是消灭文盲，然后是大兴学校教育，和社会文化教育。因此苏联的文化建设乃能和军事政治经济一样飞快的发展。
    战前斯大林的三个五年计划，都是需要文化作基础的。我现在简单说说这三个五年计划是什么：第一个五年计划是国家工业化，就是从落后的农业国家转变为进步的工业国家。（我们毛主席也多次讲到，我们中国要想独立、进步、富强、康乐，亦必须从农业国变为工业国。）苏联第二个五年计划，是农业集体化。农民是散漫无组织的，这在中国外国都是一样，但只有农业集体化，收获才能提高，因为集体农场使用拖拉机耕田，使用机器播种，使用康拜因收割，这样不仅是节省了人力，而且收获量大。第一第二两个五年计划是衔接的，工业化以后有了机器拖拉机站，才可能有集体农场，但两个五年计划的实现，同样都要以文化为基础，假使人民都不懂文化，最简单地说，机器怎样开动？宣传介绍又怎样进行？
    假若没有强迫教育保护文化等的措施，显然五年计划是难以进行的。
    假若在第一第二个五年计划中，文化教育起了很大作用的话，那么在第三个五年计划与文化建设的任务，就更重大了。第三个五年计划是把苏联从社会主义国家转为共产主义国家。这除了更提高生产力以外，还需要更提高文化、教育、科学、艺术。因为几千年来人类社会一直是人剥削人的社会，人们头脑所中的毒是很深的。共产主义社会就要求所有的人的脑子要改造一下，从心理上、精神上、思想意识上，肃清资本主义的残余，把所有的人都变为共产主义者。所以在第三个五年计划中，文化教育的作用是特别大的。
    不幸这第三个五年计划尚未完成，希特勒德国发动了战争，这时苏联就不能不集中一切力量来对付侵略者，保卫祖国。但应该知道苏联的文化教育，在战胜德寇的大战中发挥了很大的力量。苏联的战胜法西斯德国，是由于苏联军队的英勇，是由于斯大林大元帅的英明的战略指挥，但也由于苏联的人与其他的人不同。他们所受的教育不同，脑子不同，没有一个苏联人不是热爱自己的祖国，新爱国主义的热情充满了他们的心。他们乃能够打这样的一个胜仗。在另一方面希特勒德国的军队是没有文化的，他们只是机器，他们不知道为什么要打仗。法西斯是不喜欢文化，讨厌文化，乃至害怕文化的。在希特勒德国被打垮之后，几个月的时间，苏联军队又回师东向，一举而击溃了日本陆军的精锐——关东军，这又是苏联人民教育的效果，因为苏联的人民和军队懂得他们的使命，除了消灭西方战争的温床以外，他们还必须消灭东方的战争温床——日本帝国主义，世界才得和平，人类才得解放。
    战争结束以后，苏联开始实行战后五年计划。
    今年我曾到过苏联两次，从我看到的苏联不仅完全恢复了战前的建设，而且已经大大地超过了。生活与文化各方面比我以前所见到的不知要高出多少倍。可以确定地说：苏联现在是世界上文化教育最发达的国家。
    苏联目前的教育，是全体人民的。所有的学龄儿童都要读书，就是说教育是强迫的。强迫教育在城市中是七年，乡村中四年。这样就是说，全体苏联人至少都是小学毕业，或初中毕业，都可以写信、看报、读书了。旧俄时代在一九一三年全部的高级学校，包括大学专科学校等只有九十一个，只有十一万二千个大学生；而现在高级学校有八百多个，有七十三万大学生，比欧洲其他国家大学生加起来的总数还要多。中学有三千多，学生有一百多万，小学有三千多万学生，另外函授学校的学生有二十七万人。
    除此以外，旧俄时代很多落后的民族，那时根本没有学校，没有文字的，现在全说自己的话，使用自己的文字，并以之教育自己的儿童。所有的少数民族都用自己的文字出版书籍，少数民族用自己的文字向最高苏维埃写呈文是完全合法的。完全取消了民族压迫，充分发展各民族的文化。
    在苏联革命以前，全俄的自然科学工作者只有三千人，现在已有了十万多人，其中有三四万的大学教授、博士、讲师、硕士，他们用马克思列宁主义的观点，最进步的观点，研究科学的各部门，其成绩在世界上是最高的。
    现在谈谈苏联的一般文化。
    苏联的一般文化在全世界上是最高的。可以讲讲这个道理。中国有句古话说：“衣食足而后礼义兴”，现在全世界那一个国家的人民，能象苏联人民不担心吃饭穿衣作工的问题？在苏联学生不担心升学，大学毕业不担心工作，所有的人不担心衣、食、住。在这样的物质基础上，自然人人都可以学文化了。在美国及其他资本主义的国家里，只有少数人有文化，有了文化，好升官发财，他们的子女受教育，也为了再升官再发财。而被称作“下层人”的工农大众，担心吃饭、穿衣、工作之不暇，那里还有可能去学文化？同时资本主义的国家是害怕工人文化高的，工人文化高了会觉悟，会反抗。资本家只敢叫工人有一点点文化，来使用机器。社会主义的国家不怕人民文化高，越高越好，文化高，生产得更好，人民生活越幸福，每一个人都可能有很高的文化。社会主义国家的文化发展是无限制的，这是和资本主义国家的根本不同点。因此我说苏联一般文化是最高的，这话是有根据的。
    除了学校以外，在苏联社会教育的设施很多。苏联每个城市都有文化宫，文化宫里面有图书馆、阅览室、俱乐部、音乐厅、体育场等等，每一个工人或学生，都可以在工作完毕休息时，进去作正当的娱乐或读书。每个城市都有文化休息公园、都有图书馆、阅览室。电影院剧院之多，超过任何国家。光在莫斯科一城，就有二十一个文化宫。高尔基文化学习公园的一个露天剧场，可以容纳几万人；有一五二个职工俱乐部，这都是在工厂里面的，在俱乐部里工人可以听讲演，看演剧或电影，读书、运动……还有二千三百个图书馆，六十个博物馆，这是在莫斯科一地。其他的城市都有这样的设备，甚至小小的一个车站都可以看到图书馆、阅览室的设施。
    在农村中总共有十万个俱乐部，有四百个文化宫，有两万个电影院，苏联是很注重体育的，现在全国最好的运动场有六百个，普通的则有一万七千个，滑雪场九千个，大的游泳池有五百个。
    我想特别谈谈苏联工人的文化。
    苏联每个工厂都有文化的设备，有工人子弟学校、成年工人补习班，提高工人的文化程度，我到过几个工人家中看过，简直有些难于相信这是工人的宿舍。一次到一个斯达汉诺夫式的工人家里走走，见他家有三间房：一间卧室，一间书房，一间会客室兼食堂。我曾问他工作之后作些什么，他说看电影、看戏、看书、读报。他每月收入有一万多卢布，物质生活优裕，文化程度自然也提高了。这是一个熟练的技术工人。另外我有一次乘长途汽车时同司机谈话。那位司机读书读的很多，对学术上各种派别都能滔滔不绝地谈论。还有一次我在火车中遇到一个老年人和一个青年在争论萧洛霍夫写的“静静的顿河”和“被开垦的处女地”那一部最好的问题，后来我知道了那位老年人是铁路局的会计，青年人是一个钢铁场的工人。由此可见苏联职工文化程度的一般了。
    苏联的文学艺术是极为光辉的，革命以前的俄国文学，其写实主义之深刻，其地位在世界是很高的。革命以后，苏联的作家们，承继了这个优良的传统，并发扬光大。苏联的文学艺术都有很深厚的教育意义，不象资产阶级作品的无聊，戏剧电影都能使人发现问题，解决问题，不象美国影片的堕落腐败。苏联的作家是很多的尤其是近年来有许多新的作家都获得了斯大林奖金，我们中国翻译苏联作品很多。我们在延安的时候，曾经调查一个学校，里边五百多个学生的绝大多数都是因为读了高尔基等俄国作家的作品而走向革命的，现在北京的青年们我想也有很多是因为读了苏联作家的作品而改变自己的人生观参加革命工作的。苏联文学艺术作品艺术性、政治性、思想性之高，拿斯大林所说“作家是人的灵魂的工程师”这句话就可以知道了。
    总结以上所讲，我举出苏联的文化教育的三个特点：
    第一、苏联的文化是为大众的，是大众自己的。苏联的文化教育不断地高涨，现在苏联的工农已经知识分子化了，每一个苏联工人和农民都有知识，而且已有许多大学教授、高等知识分子，都是工人农民出身的。
    第二、爱国主义苏联的文化教育反对忘本的世界主义，热爱并重视自己民族的历史和文化遗产，反对堕落腐败的西欧和美国文化，反对盲目崇拜外国的一切。（国民党反动派正是奴性的崇拜腐臭的美国文化的一群。）
    第三、国际主义。国际主义反对狭隘的民族主义、狭隘的民族主义反对其他民族的一切，还要侵略他人，压迫他人。国际主义者常常把帝国主义者国家的政府和这些国家的人民分别看待，反对帝国主义的政府，反对他们的侵略，这是爱国主义。拥护一切国家里为民主自由而斗争的人民，把他们当作自己的兄弟看待，这是国际主义。苏联政府和人民则是一体的，人民与政府都支持援助一切被压迫侵略的人民，所以我们对苏联和对帝国主义等国家的态度（把人民和政府分开）是不能一样的。
    苏联文化教育的爱国主义精神，使它打垮了德国，把自己解放了出来；苏联文化教育的国际主义精神，使它帮助了捷克、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、匈牙利……从法西斯，德国奴役下获得了解放，并在远东打败了日本，使北朝鲜和中国东北人民得到解放。今年六月底，我从乌克兰首都基辅过的时候，看见基辅大街上有几张大木板制的中国人民解放军胜利图。那上面逐日把已解放的城市都插上小旗子、点亮了灯泡，好多人看了地图都露出很愉快的样子，从这点也可以看出，苏联人民对中国人民解放的关心，及其国际主义精神的表现。
    我们要学习苏联的文化，要学习苏联人民的高度觉悟的、全面的、普及的、民族的、科学的、大众的、爱国主义的、国际主义的文化与教育。
