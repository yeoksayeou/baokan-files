　　Correcting Deviations in Trial Production and Sales
  　Four Beijing Soap Factories Officially Merge
    [Beijing News] The trial joint operation of four soap factories in Beijing, including Lizhong, Xinchang, Dahua, and Youxin, has gained experience and officially started joint operation with centralized production. In September, five factories in the industry, including Lizhong, Xinchang, Dahua, Youxin, and Huaxing, planned to merge due to poor sales, high costs, large expenses, and difficulty in maintaining independent production. However, the capitalists of each factory did not have a sufficient understanding of the advantages of adopting the joint operation method, and most were skeptical and waited and watched. Therefore, at the beginning, the five factories only unified production of soap with the same brand and the same ingredients, but did not centralize production. As a result, the quality could not be unified, sales could not be opened up, and the joint operation work existed only in name. This path was impassable, so they switched to having the five factories jointly contribute funds to concentrate production in two factories; at the same time, the five factories still produced their original brand of soap. Thus, when the interests of this factory conflicted with the overall interests, some factories only cared about themselves and ignored the whole. For example, the Huaxing factory would not sell the jointly operated soap even after its own soap was sold out. After taking this detour, by the middle of this month, the factories were determined to correct the deviations. Except for Huaxing's withdrawal from the joint operation due to internal disputes, the remaining four factories have thoroughly centralized and cooperated their workers, technology, funds, and machinery to form the "Beijing Soap Production Cooperative" to produce "Beijing" brand soap. Each factory stopped its original production and raised a batch of funds equivalent to six hundred boxes of soap as working capital. The manpower saved by the four factories, plus the telephone, water, electricity, rent, and miscellaneous expenses saved by the three factories, can save more than 5,000 jin of millet per month. After the joint operation, the first benefit is that the cost is reduced, and the second is that the quality is improved. Excellent technicians and workers are now being concentrated to improve quality, and raw materials are never adulterated (such as sodium silicate, etc.). The allocation ratio is twelve and a half jin of oil per box of soap (70% tallow, 20% sesame oil, 10% peanut oil) and seven jin of alkali liquor. It is estimated that the pure soap content in one piece of soap can reach 75%, ensuring no free alkali or free oil, and the ingredients are also minimized, containing at most 2% to 3%. It produces more foam when used and has great power to remove dirt. The quality is estimated to be medium or above among the general soap qualities in this city. It is estimated that production can be maintained if 1,000 boxes can be sold each month.
    [Another News] The joint sales organized by the Beijing Soap Industry Guild have been joined by 84 factories in the city. Two locations were opened on Dongdan and Bamiancao on the 15th of this month, and three more locations were added on Qianmen Avenue, Dongsi Chaoyangmen Avenue, and Chongwai Avenue on the 22nd, listing various soaps, which are 10% to 15% cheaper than the market price, making it easy for consumers to choose and buy.

　　纠正试办中产销上的偏向
  　京四家造胰厂正式联营
    【北京讯】京市造胰业利中、信昌、大华、又新等四厂试办联营，获得经验，开始正式联营，集中生产。九月间，该业利中、信昌、大华、又新、华星等五厂，以销路不佳，成本高、开支大，维持单独生产困难，乃计划联营，但各厂资方对采取联营方式的优点认识不够，多存疑虑观望，所以开始时五厂只是统一生产同样牌号同样成分的肥皂，并不集中生产，结果品质不能划一，销路打不开，联营工作有名无实。此路走不通，转而改为由五厂合出资金集中两厂生产；同时五厂仍兼制自己原来牌号肥皂。于是当本厂利益和全体利益冲突时，有的厂就只顾自己忽视全体。象华星厂自己造的肥皂卖完了也不卖联营的肥皂。走过这一段弯路后，到本月中旬，各厂决心纠正偏向，除华星因该厂内部纠纷退出联营外，其余四厂已把各厂工人、技术、资金、机器彻底集中合作，组织“北京肥皂产联社”，生产“北京”牌肥皂。各厂停止原来本厂生产，并筹集了折合六百箱肥皂的一批资金作为流动资金。四厂节省的人力加上三个厂节省的电话、灯水、房租和杂项开支，每月共可节省五千余斤小米。联营之后，第一个好处是成本减低了，其次是品质提高。现正集中优秀技师技工，努力改进品质，原料绝不掺假（如泡花碱等）。配备比例是一箱肥皂十二斤半油（牛油七成、麻油二成、花生油一成）、七斤碱水，估计一块肥皂中的纯皂量能到百分之七十五，保证没有游离碱，游离油，成分也尽量减少，最多含百分之二到百分之三。使用时泡沫多，去泥垢力量大，在本市一般肥皂品质中可居中等以上，估计每月若能销出一千箱即可维持生产。
    【又讯】京市造胰业同业公会主办的联合推销，全市已有八十四厂参加，本月十五日在东单和八面槽开设两处，二十二日起又在前门大街、东四朝阳门大街和崇外大街增设三处，罗列各色肥皂，比市价便宜百分之十到百分之十五，便于消费者选购。
