Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 14th: TASS, Paris, 12th: The French Communist Party's newspaper, l'Humanité, reports: 15,000 people in Mulhouse (south of Strasbourg), Upper Rhine, held a rally demanding the establishment of a democratic and unified government. French Communist Party General Secretary Thorez delivered a speech at the rally, first discussing Daladier's Munich betrayal policy that led to the war and the serious consequences of the war. He then stated: Today, the same threat is menacing our country. Only we communists are warning against this danger. Our country was sold out to Hitler by the Munich elements and the Vichy elements. At that time, only our party, in an underground state, stood up in opposition. Today, new Munich elements are selling out our country to American imperialism. The Marshall Plan and the North Atlantic Treaty are means of colonizing our country. American imperialism is sacrificing French interests to support the revival of German financial groups. Why is such indulgence given to the German reactionaries? Because the American tycoons believe that, in the future, revanchist Germany will be an ally in the anti-Soviet war they are preparing. We oppose the German reactionaries, but we must clearly state: loyal to proletarian internationalism, we support reaching an agreement with the German people. The reactionaries are conducting anti-Soviet slander and propaganda, wanting to make the people forget a simple fact, namely, that socialism is peace, and capitalism is war. They want to make the people forget the great sacrifices of the Soviet army and the Soviet state. They want to make the French people forget that the Franco-Soviet alliance is the most reliable guarantee of peace and security. Precisely for this reason, the French people do not want to fight against their ally, the Soviet Union, against the people of any other country, against the Vietnamese people.

Thorez then discussed the French government crisis, saying: The government crisis is caused by the pressure of the laboring masses who are suffering from this government. From now on, the issue is not merely changing the composition of the government or making some changes in the cabinet. The issue is not about appointing a Moch (formerly translated as Moche), such an appointment is a challenge to the working class. The issue is: changing the national policy, ending the policy of poverty, reaction, and war directed by American capitalists, and pursuing a policy of French progress, freedom, peace, and independence, and to this end, establishing a democratic and unified government.

Thorez outlined the ten-one-point program proposed by the French Communist Party, stating: A democratic and unified government—is the demand shouted in unison by the resolutions passed by thousands of rallies, these rallies demonstrate the great unity of all working people, all republicans. The enemies of the people are forced to admit that the unity between the grass-roots organizations of various groups is becoming increasingly close. Despite the anti-communist and anti-labor people's divisive activities carried out by the Socialist Party leaders headed by Blum, Ramadier, Moch, etc., the Socialist Party workers are increasingly convinced that their leaders have led them astray, causing serious damage to the cause of the laboring people and the cause of the Republic. As for the working Catholics, they do not recognize the right of cardinals to determine the standards of their political actions. We continue to extend our hand of friendship to them. We will continue to call for unity to achieve the welfare of the French working class and the Republic.

Thorez finally called on all working people to support the Communist Party and expressed his firm belief that the struggle would surely be victorious. He said, "We are approaching the decisive battle, and therefore also approaching the victory of the working class. Do not wait for disaster to strike our country again. We must have confidence, we will maintain peace, we will advance along the path of socialism."

At the same time, 10,000 working people in Rouen (northwest of Paris) also held a rally, where French Communist Party leader Duclos delivered a speech. The meeting unanimously passed a resolution demanding the establishment of a democratic and unified government.

　　法共领袖多列士演说
    揭露美帝殖民地化法国的阴谋斥莫克组阁为向工人阶级挑战
    各地工人集会要求建立民主统一政府
    【新华社北京十四日电】塔斯社巴黎十二日讯：法共机关报人道报报道：上莱因省牟罗兹（斯特拉斯堡以南）一万五千人举行大会，要求建立民主统一政府。法共总书记多列士在大会发表演说，首先论及曾经招致战争的达拉第的慕尼黑的叛卖政策和严重的战争后果，继称：今天，同样的威胁正威胁着我国。只有我们共产党人为这一危险提出警告。我国曾被慕尼黑分子和维希分子出卖给希特勒。那时，只有处在地下状态的我党出而反对。今天，新慕尼黑分子正把我国出卖给美国帝国主义。马歇尔计划和北大西洋公约是殖民化我国的手段。美帝国主义正牺牲法国的权益以扶植德国财阀的复活。为什么这样纵容德国反动派呢？因为，美国富豪们认为，今后，复仇主义的德国是他们所正在准备的反苏战争中的盟友。我们反对德国反动派，但我们必须清楚表示：忠于无产阶级国际主义的我们，拥护与德国人民取得协议。反动派们进行反苏污蔑宣传，想使人民忘记一个简单的事实，即社会主义就是和平，资本主义就是战争。他们想使人民忘记苏联军队和苏联国家的巨大牺牲。他们愿意使法国人民忘记：法苏同盟是和平和安全的最可靠保证。正因为如此，所以法国人民不愿对他们的盟国——苏联，对任何其他国家的人民，对越南人民作战。
    多列士继而论及法国政府危机称：政府危机是身受这一政府之苦的劳动群众的压力所引起的。从今以后，问题完全不是仅仅改变政府的成份或在内阁中作一些变动。问题并不在于任命一位莫克（前译摩许），这样的任命乃是对工人阶级的挑战。问题乃是：改变国家政策，结束美国资本家所指挥的贫穷、反动和战争的政策，而奉行法兰西进步、自由、和平和独立的政策，并为此而建立民主统一政府。
    多列士概述法共所建议的十一点纲领称：民主统一政府——是千百个集会所通过的决议所一致喊出的要求，这些集会表现了一切劳动人民、一切共和分子的大联合。人民的敌人被迫承认，各团体的基层组织间的团结正日益紧密。尽管以勃鲁姆、拉马第、莫克等为首的社会党领袖进行反共与反劳动人民的分裂活动，社会党工人却正日益深信他们的领袖已使他们离开正确道路，致使劳动人民的事业和共和国的事业受到严重打击。至于劳动的天主教徒，他们也并不承认红衣主教有确定他们的政治行动的标准的权利。我们继续向他们伸着友谊的手。我们将继续号召联合以取得法国工人阶级和共和国的福利。
    多列士最后呼吁一切劳动人民支持共产党，并表示深信斗争必定胜利。他说：“我们正接近决战，因而也正接近工人阶级的胜利。不要等待灾难再度侵袭我国。我们要有信心，我们将维护住和平，我们将沿着社会主义的道路前进。”
    同时，卢昂（巴黎西北）亦有一万劳动人民举行大会，法共领袖杜克洛在会上发表演说。大会一致通过决议要求建立民主统一政府。
