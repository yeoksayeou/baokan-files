　　"The Nation's!"
　　Yang
　　Last Sunday, we were studying on the highway. While the truck was parked by the roadside, a rickshaw puller told us: "There is also an armored vehicle on the West Suburb Garrison Road, why don't you go and pull it back?"
　　The next day, we went over there to take a look, and sure enough, in a temple, there was an ultra-light tank, covered up well and placed in the courtyard. In the kitchen next to it, an old fellow villager was sifting rice, so we asked him: "Who does this tank belong to?"
　　"The nation's!" He answered matter-of-factly, and went back to his work, head down.
　　"We know it belongs to the nation, but we are asking you who abandoned this vehicle here? Who is in charge of guarding it?"
　　At this point, he looked up, and when he saw it was us, he quickly said: "Oh, it's comrades, please sit down, please sit down. Are you asking about this vehicle? It was during the siege of the city when the reactionaries were fleeing from Fengtai to the city, the armored vehicle broke down here. The people on the vehicle were getting down to repair it, and some child shouted: 'The Eighth Route Army is coming!' Those reactionaries didn't care about the vehicle and fled for their lives.
　　Afterwards, everyone said that it costs a lot of money to build an armored vehicle. A few days ago, some people who drive cars even came to steal parts. So, we decided to take turns to guard it every night. Later, everyone felt that it was not safe to leave it outside, so we used several small donkeys to pull it into the temple. The nation's property, me@①, must be protected by everyone, don't you think?"
　　By this time, many villagers had come, including people from the farmers' association. We told them that we were preparing to pull the vehicle back for repair. I was afraid that they had guarded it for so many days and would be unhappy if we took it away all of a sudden. But they were all very willing. An old man said, "This is the best thing, because we don't have to spend time watching it every day, worrying about bad people coming to steal it. And such a good thing is wasted here. The People's Liberation Army can use it when they repair it." He then turned to ask me: "Comrade, can this armored vehicle still fight?"
　　Two days later, we used a tractor to pull the tank. As soon as the villagers heard the sound of the engine, they all came out and helped us sweep away the grass covering the vehicle. Watching us pull the tank away, everyone smiled happily. Some people were even praising: "Our People's Liberation Army really has a way. It moved as soon as it was pulled. It took us so much effort to move it in that day. This vehicle will definitely be repaired in the hands of the People's Liberation Army."
　　We thanked them for their care of the national property these past few months, and they all repeatedly said: "It's our duty, it's our duty." After getting into the truck, I could still hear the old man shouting loudly: "Comrade, after you repair this vehicle, drive it to our village for a spin!"

　　“国家的！”
    阳
    上星期日，我们在公路上学习。车子在路旁休息的时候，一个三轮车夫告诉我们说：“在西郊警备路也有一辆铁甲车，你们怎么不去拉回来呢？”
    第二天我们到那边去看了一下，在一座庙里果然有一辆超轻坦克，上面盖得好好的放在天井里。旁边的厨房里正有一位老乡在筛米，我们就问他：“这个坦克是谁的呀？”
    “国家的！”他理直气壮的回答了一下，低着头还干着他的工作。
    “是国家的我们也知道，我们是问问你这个车是谁丢在这里的？谁在保管的？”
    这时他抬起头来，一看是我们，连忙说：“噢，是同志，请坐请坐。你问这个车的事情吗？还是围城的时候，反动派由丰台往城里逃，铁甲车到这里出了毛病，车上的人正下来修，不知道谁家的孩子叫了声：八路来了。那些反动派就顾不得要车子逃命了。
    以后大伙说，造一个铁甲车要不少的钱，头几天有几个开汽车的还来偷过零件。就商定每天晚上轮流派人看管。以后大家觉得放在外面总不大放心，又用几条小毛驴把它拉到庙里来了。国家的东西ｍｅ＠①，总得大伙来保护，你说是不是？”
    这时已经来了不少老乡，也有农会里的人。我们告诉他们准备把这个车拉回去修理。我恐怕他们保管了这么多天一下子就拉去会不大高兴。但他们却都很愿意，一位老头儿说：“这再好也没有了，一来是我们不用每天再费功夫看着，担心坏人来偷。二来这样的好东西放在这里也白费了，解放军修起来正用得着。”他又转过来问我：“同志，这个铁甲车还能打仗吧！”
    过了两天我们用一个牵引车去拉这辆坦克，老乡们一听到机器声音就都出来了。并帮着我们扫除车上盖着的草。看着我们把坦克拉动了，大家就高兴的笑了起来。还有人在称赞：“咱们解放军真有办法。一拉就拉动了，那一天我们用多大的劲才搬进来。这车子拿到解放军手里一定能修起来。”
    我们向他们感谢这几个月来大家对国家财产的爱护，他们都连说：“应该，应该。”上了车后我还听到那个老头儿在大声说：“同志，把这车修好后，开到咱村来走走呵！”
