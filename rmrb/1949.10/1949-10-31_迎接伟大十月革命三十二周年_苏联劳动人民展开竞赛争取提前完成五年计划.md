Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 30th: TASS reports: Soviet workers are currently launching a socialist competition to strive for early completion of the Five-Year Plan, welcoming the 32nd anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution. The number of workers and enterprises that have completed the Five-Year Plan or this year's annual plan ahead of schedule is increasing daily. Not only are many outstanding Stakhanovite movement participants making increasingly innovative creations in improving labor productivity, but also the collective Stakhanovite movement (i.e., the production of all workers in a factory or work department exceeding quotas) is also widely unfolding in various places.

In the Moscow Oblast and the city of Moscow, hundreds of enterprises have completed the Five-Year Plan, including the capital's largest "Hercules" machine manufacturing plant. All industries in Moscow's Sverdlovsk district completed the Five-Year Plan in three years, nine months, and three days. In the Urals, the blast furnace workers and rolling mill workers of the Serov Iron and Steel Plant have completed the post-war Five-Year Plan. In Nizhny Tagil, 20,000 Stakhanovite movement participants have completed the Five-Year Plan quota. In the factories and mines of the Donbas, 15,000 people have completed the plan. More than fifty enterprises in Estonia and dozens of enterprises in Lithuania, Latvia, and many enterprises in other allied republics have announced that their Five-Year Plan quotas have been completed. In Almaty, the capital of the Kazakh Republic, more than 3,000 workers have completed the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, and now some factories there are producing goods for 1951. Dozens of factories in Ukraine, Georgia, and other allied republics are welcoming the great October Revolution Day by completing the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

In addition, many enterprises in Moscow, Leningrad, Minsk, and Tbilisi have also completed their annual production targets ahead of schedule. Thirty factories and manufacturing plants in Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine, are already producing products from the 1950 plan, and forty enterprises in Lviv have completed their 1949 plan.

In the competition to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, Stakhanovite movement participants are constantly demonstrating creativity, improving the original capabilities of equipment, and improving production technology. For example, in a machine manufacturing plant in the Stalin Oblast, advanced machine tool managers have successfully achieved unheard-of labor productivity, such as machine operator Kulik, who first used accelerated metal casting in his enterprise and began to manage two machine tools simultaneously, completing a week's work in one day. Machine operator Chiculin of the mining machine tool manufacturing plant also successfully competed with Kulik, completing a month's quota for October within ten days.

Now, collective Stakhanovite work competitions are being organized in countless enterprises. The Moscow "Caliber" factory, which pioneered the collective Stakhanovite movement on the suggestion of Rositsky, has all departments working in a collective Stakhanovite manner. All employees of the Moscow Carburetor Factory have received this glorious title. The same title has also been given to the employees of the Vysokogorsk iron ore mine in the Urals, the seven main departments of the "Plug and Hammer" factory in Kharkiv, and other enterprises. This collective Stakhanovite labor of millions of Soviet people enables the rapid completion of the post-war Five-Year Plan and greatly contributes to the continued growth of Soviet national strength.

    苏联劳动人民展开竞赛争取提前完成五年计划
    【新华社北京三十日电】塔斯社讯：苏联劳动人民现正展开社会主义竞赛，以争取提前完成五年计划，迎接伟大的十月社会主义革命三十二周年纪念。提前完成五年计划或今年全年计划的工人数目和企业的数目，正逐日增加。不仅许多优秀的斯塔哈诺夫运动者，在提高劳动生产率方面有日新月异的创造，同时集体斯塔哈诺夫运动（即一个工厂或一个工作部门的全部工人的生产，都超过了定额），也在各地广泛展开。
    在莫斯科州和莫斯科市，已有数以百计的企业完成了五年计划，其中包括首都最大的“力士”机器制造厂。莫斯科斯维德洛夫斯克区的全部工业，在三年九个月零三天中完成了五年计划。在乌拉尔，谢罗夫钢铁厂鼓风炉工人和辗压机工人已完成战后五年计划。在下塔吉尔，已有两万斯塔哈诺夫运动者完成五年计划的定额。在顿巴斯的工厂和矿坑，已有一万五千人完成计划。爱沙尼亚的五十多个企业和立陶宛、拉脱维亚的数十个企业，以及其他加盟共和国的许多企业宣布它们的五年计划定额都已经完成。在哈萨克共和国首都阿拉木图，三千多个工人已先期完成五年计划，现在那里有若干工厂已在生产着一九五一年的物品。乌克兰、乔治亚及其他加盟共和国的几十个工厂，正在以提先完成五年计划来迎接伟大的十月革命节。
    此外，莫斯科、列宁格勒、明斯克和第佛利斯的许多企业，也已在预期前完成了全年的生产目标。乌克兰首都基辅的三十个工厂和制造厂，已在生产一九五○年计划中的产品了，罗夫的四十个企业，已经完成了它们的一九四九年计划。
    在争取提前完成五年计划的竞赛中，斯塔哈诺夫运动者们不断地表现出创造性，他们提高了装备的原定能力，并改良了生产技术。例如，在斯大林州的机器制造厂中，先进的工作母机管理者，成功地达到了闻所未闻的劳动生产率，如机工库力克，在他的企业中，首先使用加速金属熔铸法，并开始同时兼管两辆工作母机，他一日就完成了一个星期的工作。采矿工作母机制造厂的机工契库连，也成功地与库力克竞赛着，他在十天之内完成了十月份一个月的定额。
    现在无数企业中，正组织着集体斯塔哈诺夫方式的工作竞赛。由罗西斯基的建议而首创集体斯塔哈诺夫运动的莫斯科“加利伯”工厂，所有各部门都以集体斯塔哈诺夫方式工作着。莫斯科碳化器工厂的全体职工，已经获得了这个光荣的称号。同样的称号也已给予乌拉尔的维索克高尔斯克铁砂矿坑，哈尔科夫的“塞子与锤子”工厂的七个主要部门，以及其他企业的职工。这种数以百万计的苏维埃人民的集体斯塔哈诺夫式的劳动，使战后五年计划得以迅速完成，大大地有助于苏联国力的继续增长。
