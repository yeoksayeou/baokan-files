　　[Beijing News] A branch warehouse of a certain warehouse of the North China Military Region was set up in a village in the Fifth District of Hengshui County, Hebei Province. Because the Hengshui County government correctly recognized that the warehouse's assets are the people's assets, and everyone is responsible for protecting the warehouse, they actively assisted and sent people to cooperate with the branch warehouse to quickly and safely put the materials into the warehouse, and sent a public security team to guard around the warehouse. When building the warehouses, the Fifth District Office and the District Party Committee Secretary personally went to various villages to organize villagers with good backgrounds to work in shifts at the warehouse, paying attention to preventing bad elements from sneaking in, and successfully completed the construction task. In order to protect the safety of the warehouse, the militia in each village in the Fifth District were organized, especially the villages surrounding the stationed village, and the Hengshui and Shenxian counties formed a joint defense headquarters to be vigilant against sabotage by special agents. The Hengshui County government and relevant districts and villages, due to their emphasis on protecting state property, were able to strengthen organizational leadership, with responsible cadres personally taking action, actively mobilizing and organizing the masses to help with warehouse work, and safeguarding warehouse safety, thus achieving success. This spirit of cherishing the people's property is worthy of learning from all regions, and the North China People's Government hereby issues a circular of commendation. (China News Agency)
