　　Concentrating Manpower and Resources to Overcome Production and Sales Difficulties
    Beijing's Weaving, Dyeing, and Other Industries Form Joint Ventures
    Greatly Reducing Costs and Striving to Improve Quality

    [Beijing News] Beijing’s private weaving and dyeing, cigarette, soap making, and knitting industries have begun to engage in joint operations, pooling funds, machinery, and technology, improving factory management, and raising the quality of finished products in order to overcome current production and sales difficulties. Factories in the weaving and dyeing industry that currently use manual looms have low output and high costs, making it difficult to develop; a few that are poorly managed are even losing money. The five factories of Xieshengxin, Gongda, Qingfeng, Tianlong, and Xinhua, which in the past were extremely difficult to maintain, have, under the guidance of the government, jointly operated and started work on the 6th of this month. These five factories will select forty of the best manual looms and concentrate them for production, saving a great deal of manpower and financial resources. In terms of manpower: the original managers and staff of the factories totaled twenty people, but now, after the merger, there are only nine people. These staff members also participate in winding bobbins and twisting fringes during their spare time. Eleven workers involved in sizing yarn and cooks have also been saved. In terms of financial resources: electricity, telephones, stationery, rent, etc. have all been reduced by varying amounts of three to four times. In the past, each factory transported yarn and cloth in small quantities; now they are transported in large quantities, saving a lot of freight costs. In this way, costs have been greatly reduced. Technically, everyone is studying technical experience together, striving for excellent quality. At present, the production enthusiasm of all employees is very high. A contract has been signed with the People's Printing Factory to weave 1,000 bolts of wiping cloth, which is expected to generate a net profit of at least 1,600 catties of millet. The cigarette industry is also currently experimenting with joint operations, which are being managed by the Production Guidance Department of the industry association's preparatory committee. Forty households have already participated. The joint operation method is to raise shares, with each share being 10,000 yuan. The first production run of "Great Era" brand cigarettes is twenty boxes, totaling 661 shares. Raw materials such as tobacco leaves and cigarette paper are jointly purchased from Tianjin, which is about 20% cheaper than market prices. The first batch of goods will be manufactured by Xin Yi and Huamei factories and is expected to be fully shipped before the 20th of this month. The sales of finished products will also be handled by the industry association in the future. The joint operation of the soap making industry is divided into two parts: production and sales. Five companies are participating in the joint production, pooling funds together, with two companies manufacturing the product. The first production run of 400 boxes of the new "Beijing" brand soap has already seen 200 boxes shipped. After all the boxes are out they plan to jointly promote and sell the product in the Northwest and Tianjin. After gaining experience, they will decide to pool funds and expand production. The registration for the joint sales in this industry is currently underway. Four locations will be piloted in the city, and the addresses of the two locations in Dongdan and Bamiancao have been selected and are scheduled to open on the 15th. The knitting industry is preparing for joint sales, with more than 200 companies participating. The location is selected in Dongxiaoshi, Chongwai. In terms of joint production in this industry, plans are being made to concentrate some yarn dyeing factories into four factories in order to reduce costs and increase output and quality.
