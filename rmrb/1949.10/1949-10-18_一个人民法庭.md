　　A People's Court
    S·Bo'erjin
    Justice... Nowhere, at no time, have these two words had such a rich and profound meaning as on the land of the Soviet Union.
    Only where the people are truly free, where they themselves hold power, where they themselves make the laws, where they themselves enforce them, and where they themselves are the judges, can justice have the highest authority.
    The great Lenin saw this guarantee of justice long ago. At the beginning of the Soviet Republic, he wrote: "Citizens must all participate in the affairs of the court and the state." This command of Lenin has already been implemented.
    ... The ancient Greeks tied up the eyes of their judicial goddess Themis and placed a scale in her hand, on which she weighed people's good and bad deeds.
    "That blindfold on Themis's eyes is truly an absurd thing!" said Alexandra Porovna (she is a people's judge of the Sixth District of the Moscow Voljski region). "In my opinion, it is not a symbol of impartiality, but rather an expression of indifference. As a people's judge, it is impossible not to deeply understand the judgment of a case. We judges," she continued, "are the true engineers of the human soul. We stand up against those who have gone astray, and our job is to call them back to the right path and prevent others from going astray. We are fighting for humanity... for justice!"
    The person who truly has the power, not just formally, to pronounce judgments in the name of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic must possess legal knowledge, rich experience, and a deep love for his compatriots.
    Alexandra Porovna has this power.
    The school of life has given her much education. She is the daughter of a railway worker, and in 1922, at the age of fifteen, she went to work in a factory, only being able to study in the evenings. Those years were difficult. In this way, Alexandra Porovna grew up with her young Soviet state, she joined the Communist Party, and received the highest education and culture. After graduating from law school, she became an assistant prosecutor and later a judge.
    In the past few years, Porovna has been a people's judge in the Moscow Voljski region of the capital, and she is well-known in this area.
    In court, she wears a tailor-made black dress, and her golden hair is simply braided on her head. She listens thoughtfully to the statements of the witnesses, comparing them with the facts studied during the investigation and the statements of the defendant and the prosecutor. When the verdict is announced, enthusiastic words of praise can be heard in the court: "Yes, this is the correct verdict!"
    While unanimously electing her as a judge, the people of her district also elected Alexandra Porovna as a representative to the Moscow Soviet. Workers from the largest factories, employees from government offices, and housewives all voted for her, which is a manifestation of their highest respect for her.
    ... When the court is called to order, Alexandra Porovna takes her seat, and beside her are the people's jurors. They have the same rights as the judge, and they are also elected by universal, direct, and equal secret ballot.
    The Soviet people have entrusted the right to try violators of the law to the most trustworthy people. The only difference between the people's judge and the jurors is that the latter serve in rotation, only serving in court for ten days a year.
    In some bourgeois countries, jurors have no say in court, but jurors in Soviet courts are as important as judges.
    In the United States, thirteen states do not allow women to serve as jurors. Cabinet member Pettigrew, a person with extremely conservative views, once used the following words to explain American justice: "The American court is the worst enemy of justice, this is an obvious and correct fact." In England, jurors must be people with considerable property.
    In the Soviet Union, each court has fifty to seventy-five people's jurors, which enables hundreds of thousands of people to directly participate in the work of the court. This fact increases the power of the court organization to the greatest extent.
    Among the people's judges and jurors, there are many women. Alexandra Porovna highly praises the women who have worked with her as people's jurors many times. She mentioned Piragiatulina, Fedosia Danilushkina, housewives, and Maria Gurivech, a female factory supervisor, and some others. Enjoying the same rights as judges, they are a few of the many women who are learning to manage the country.
    A judge often says: The court record is like a mirror of the entire trial. This is praise for the work of the court stenographer. This person must have a lot of experience to record concisely and clearly everything that happens in the trial, as well as the excited words of witnesses, plaintiffs, and defendants. Antonina Starostina is a famous court stenographer.
    Finally, let's talk about the bailiff, who seems to be the last fighter in a court's fight for justice. The bailiff in Alexandra Porovna's district court is Mikhail Karasev, an old soldier, wearing several medals and a scar. He is a very silent and calm person and is very trusted.
    Let us go to Porovna's court to take a look. The location is at 41 Bolshaya Ordynka Street. We see a two-story building and a tall and solemn doorway. This house is a specimen of early 19th-century Russian architecture. A wide marble staircase leads us to the second floor. We entered a large room, painted in soft tones. Facing us is a low platform, on which are placed a table and three chairs, and on the platform hangs the golden emblem of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic.
    Now the chairs are empty, because the people in the court are discussing in the next room. There are whispered voices in the court, which then become completely silent when the door opens. When Alexandra Porovna and two people's jurors walk in, everyone stands up. Then the sound of the court is heard: "In the name of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic..."
    After the verdict is announced, a wave of applause sounds in the court.

### 一个人民法庭

　　一个人民法庭
    Ｓ·伯尔金
    正义……没有一个地方，也没有一个时期，这两个字能象在苏联的土地上那样，有如此丰富而深刻的意义。
    只有在人民是真正自由，他们自己掌握了权力，他们自己制定了法律，他们自己来执行，而且他们自己来当法官的地方，正义才能有最高的权威。
    伟大的列宁早就看出来这是正义的保证。在苏联共和国的开始他就写道：“公民们必须都来参预法庭和国家的事务。”列宁的这个命令是已经被实行了。
    ……古时的希腊人把他们的司法的女神提米斯的眼睛缚起来，在她的手里放了一架天平，就在这天平上衡量着人们的好的和坏的行为。
    “那缚在提米斯的眼上的布条真的是个多么荒谬的东西呀！”亚力山德拉波洛夫奈娃说（她是莫斯科沃瑞司基地方第六区的人民法官）：“在我看来它并不是不偏袒的象征，而是表示了它的漠然的态度。作为一个人民的法官是不可能不深刻地了解对一个案件的裁判的。我们法官，”她接着说：“是人类的灵魂的真正的工程师。我们起来反对那些走到歧路上去的人们，我们的工作就是去叫他们回到正路上来，而且防止其他人走上歧路。我们是为了人类而斗争……为了正义！”
    那真正有着权力，而不是形式上的权力，来用俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国的名义去宣布判决的人必须具备法律上的知识、丰富的经验、和对他的同胞们的深深的爱。
    亚力山德拉波洛夫奈娃就有着这种权力。
    生活的学校对她有很多的教育。她是一个铁路工人的女儿，在一九二二年，她才十五岁，就到一个工厂去工作，只有在晚上才能去念书。这些年是很困难的。就这样，亚力山德拉波洛夫奈娃和她的年轻的苏维埃国家一起长大了，她参加了共产党，而且得到了最高的教育和文化。从法律学校毕业之后，她成了一个助理检察官，后来当了法官。
    在过去的这几年里波洛夫奈娃曾经是首都的莫斯科沃瑞司基地方的人民的法官，她在这一带是很有名的。
    在法院里她穿着一件裁缝做的黑衣服，她的金色的头发在头上简单地盘成一个辫子。她深思地倾听着证人们的发言，把它和在考查时研究出来的事实以及被告和检察官的发言来比较。判决宣布的时候，在法院里就可以听见人们的热烈的赞美的言词：“对的，这才是正确的判决！”
    在一致地选举她作法官的同时，她那一区的人民也把亚力山德拉波洛夫奈娃选作参加莫斯科苏维埃的代表。最大的工厂里的工人们、机关里的职员们和家庭里的主妇们都投她的票，这就是他们对她的最高的崇敬的表现。
    ……当宣布开庭的时候，亚力山德拉波洛夫奈娃就了她的席位，在她旁边是人民的陪审官。他们和法官有同样的权利，他们也是用普遍的直接而平等的秘密投票法选出来的。
    苏联人民把审判破坏法律者的权利交给了最可信托的人们。人民法官与陪审官的唯一不同之点就是后者是轮流担任的，在一年之中仅仅在法院里服务十天。
    一些布尔乔亚国家里的陪审人在法庭上是没有什么说话的地方的，而苏联法庭中的陪审官却和法官一样重要。
    在美国，有十三个州不允许妇女担任陪审人。阁员彼蒂格鲁是个具有极端保守的观点的人，他有一次曾用以下的话来解释美国的正义：“美国的法庭是正义底最坏的敌人，这是明显而正确的事实。”在英国，陪审人必须是拥有相当财产的人。
    在苏联，每个法庭都有五十到七十五个人民的陪审官，这就使得几十万人民能够直接参预了法庭的工作。这个事实就增加了法庭组织的权力到最大的限度。
    在人民法官与陪审官之中有许多是女的。亚力山德拉波洛夫奈娃很称赞那些作为人民的陪审官来和她好几次在一起工作的妇女们。她提到了皮拉吉亚图林娜、费道西亚但尼鲁士金娜，她们是家庭的主妇，和玛利亚古力维赤，一个工厂的女监工，和一些别的人。享受着和法官同样的权利，她们是那许许多多的正在学习着管理国家的妇女中的几个人。
    一个法官常常会说：法庭的记录就象是整个审判的一面镜子一样。这是对于法庭的速记员的工作的赞美。这种人必须有很多的经验才能简明而清楚地记下在审判中进行的每一件事，以及证人、原告和被告的兴奋的言词。安东尼娜司塔若斯蒂娜就是个有名的法庭速记员。
    最后要说到那个执行员，他好象是一个法庭的为了正义而斗争的最后一个战士。在亚力山德拉波洛夫奈娃的那个区的法庭的执行员是米海尔卡拉赛夫，他是个老战士，戴着几个奖章和一道伤痕。他是个很沉默而镇定的人，而且很得到信任。
    让我们到波洛夫奈娃的法院去看一看吧。地点是在伯尔沙亚奥尔丁卡街四十一号。我们看见一座两层的楼房和一个高大而庄严的门口。这座房子是十九世纪早期的俄国式建筑的标本。一个宽大的大理石的楼梯把我们引上二层楼。我们走进了一间大屋子，是用柔和的调子的色彩涂刷的。面对着我们的是一个矮矮的台子，上面放着一张桌子和三把椅子，在台上挂着俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国的金色的徽章。
    现在那些椅子是空的，因为法庭上的人们正在旁边的屋子里讨论。在法院里有低语的声音，后来在门开开的时候就完全肃静了。当亚力山德拉波洛夫奈娃和两位人民的陪审官走进来时，每个人都站了起来。于是就听见法庭上的声音：“以俄罗斯苏联埃联邦社会主义共和国的名义……。”
    判决宣布之后，在法院中响起了一片赞许的声音。
