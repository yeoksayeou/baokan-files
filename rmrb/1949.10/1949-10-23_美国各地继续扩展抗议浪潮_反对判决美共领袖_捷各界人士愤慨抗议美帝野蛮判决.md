Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 22nd: According to a TASS dispatch from New York on the 20th: The wave of protests against the "guilty" verdict against the leaders of the Communist Party of the United States continues to expand across the United States.

Thirty senior members of the Democratic Party in California jointly submitted a petition to Truman on the 18th, requesting the revocation of the prosecution of the leaders of the Communist Party of the United States "based on the best principles of Jeffersonian democracy." The petitioners stated: The Democratic Party itself is found to be in an atmosphere of political suppression created by reactionaries, who are trying to destroy Jefferson's democratic principles. The jury's verdict "is only harmful and not beneficial to the Democratic Party." The signatories of the petition include five members of the California State Democratic Committee and several chairmen of local Democratic Party branches.

Twenty-two trade union workers and others jointly submitted a protest to Attorney General McGrath on the 18th. They described the trial as an attempt to establish "thought control." The protest was signed by Mrs. Smith, Director of the Local Branch of the Food and Tobacco Workers Union of the United States CIO, Diggs, a representative of the Bricklayers Union of the American Federation of Labor, Kaupon, Director of the Local Branch of the Furniture Workers Union of the United States CIO, Mrs. Simpkins, leader of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in Columbia, South Carolina (Mrs. Simpkins is also a local leader of the Republican Party), and Hunter, Director of the Progressive Party in North Carolina.

Fujimoto, Chairman of the Communist Party of Hawaii, said: "The verdict against the eleven leaders of the Communist Party of the United States is the greatest blow to the American people. The Communist Party of Hawaii will continue to fight to defend the leaders of the Communist Party and for peace and democracy."

Mrs. Bass, publisher of the black newspaper "California Eagle," said: The jury's verdict "is a trampling on justice and freedom. Black people should be particularly concerned about this because they will be the first to be attacked." Prominent writer McWilliams and Los Angeles pastor Flitt Joman also strongly protested the verdict.

The Civil Rights Congress issued a declaration stating: As expected, thousands of representatives of various organizations and groups will gather in Washington on the 27th to jointly save the Bill of Rights. The declaration continued: "The shameless verdict against the Communist leaders is exactly the same as in Hitler's Germany. The people must express their opinions in time, otherwise, they will be silenced from speaking later."

Many campaign rallies held by the American Labor Party in New York (referring to the by-election after Senator Wagner's retirement; after Wagner's retirement, Governor Dewey appointed Dulles as interim senator, and a by-election will be held on the 8th of next month) have turned into protest demonstrations against the verdict of the trial of the Communist leaders.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 22nd: According to a TASS dispatch from Prague on the 19th: The verdict of the American reactionaries against the eleven leaders of the American Communist Party is arousing the indignation of people from all walks of life in Czechoslovakia. The Red Rights newspaper stated that the American imperialists want to imprison the eleven leaders of the American Communist Party to imprison the thoughts that are winning victories every day all over the world, the thoughts supported by the vast majority of mankind, and the thoughts of all peace advocates. However, the defenders of freedom and peace will not remain silent. Their protest against the American jury's criminal verdict that the eleven leaders of the American Communist Party are "guilty" will be a call to urge the protection of the rights of all American people who are being attacked by the American court.

The Presidium of the Czechoslovak Lawyers Association passed a resolution, representing the Czechoslovak legal community, to protest the verdict of the jury of the Federal Court in New York. The resolution stated that this verdict is unprecedented in legal history because it makes those who study and promote scientific theories criminals.

　　美国各地继续扩展抗议浪潮
  　反对判决美共领袖
    捷各界人士愤慨抗议美帝野蛮判决
    【新华社北京二十二日电】据塔斯社纽约二十日讯：抗议判决美国共产党领袖“有罪”的浪潮，继续在美国各地扩展中。
    加利福尼亚州民主党地方高级人员三十人，于十八日联名向杜鲁门提出一个请愿书，要求“根据杰弗逊民主的最美好的原则”，撤销对美国共产党领袖的起诉。请愿者称：民主党本身即被发现处在反动派所造成的政治压制的气氛中，他们力图毁灭杰弗逊的民主原则。陪审团的裁决，“对民主党只有害而无利”。请愿书的签名者包括加利福尼亚州民主党委员会委员五人及民主党各地方党部的主席若干人。
    有二十二个职工会工作者及其他人士于十八日向司法部长麦格拉斯提出联名抗议。他们形容这次审讯是建立“思想管制”的企图。抗议书由美国产联食品与烟草工人工会地方分会主任史密斯夫人、美国劳联泥水匠工会代表迪格斯、美国产联家具工会地方分会主任考波恩、南卡罗林纳州哥伦比亚全国有色人种协进会领袖辛普金斯夫人（辛普金斯夫人也是共和党的地方领袖）、北卡罗林纳州进步党主任汉特签名。
    夏威夷共产党主席藤本称：“对十一位美国共产党领袖所作的判决，是对美国人民的最大的打击，夏威夷共产党将继续为保卫共产党领袖、为和平与民主而奋斗。”
    黑人报纸“加利福尼亚之鹰”发行人巴斯夫人称：陪审团的裁决，“是对正义和自由的蹂躏。黑人对此应该特别关切，因为他们要首先遭到攻击。”著名作家麦克威廉及洛杉矶牧师福利特乔曼对这个判决也提出强烈的抗议。
    民权保障大会发表宣言称：正如所预料的，各种组织团体的代表数千人，将于二十七日在华盛顿集会，以合力拯救权利法案。宣言继称：“对共产党领袖的无耻判决，与希特勒的德国如出一辙。人民必须及时发表意见，否则，他们以后将被箝制发言了。”
    美国劳工党在纽约举行的许多竞选大会（按即参议员华格纳退休后的补缺选举，华格纳退休后，州长杜威即任命杜勒斯暂充参议员，下月八日举行补选。）已变为对审讯共产党领袖的判决的抗议示威。
    【新华社北京二十二日电】塔斯社布拉格十九日讯：美国反动派对十一位美共领袖的判决，正在激起捷克斯洛伐克各界人士的愤慨。红色权利报称，美帝国主义者要用囚禁十一位美共领袖的办法，来禁闭每天都在全世界各地获得胜利的思想，人类绝大多数所拥护的思想，和一切和平拥护者的思想。但是，自由与和平的保卫者将不会默尔而息。他们对美国陪审团罪恶地判定十一位美共领袖“有罪”的抗议，将是促请保卫美国法庭正在进攻的全体美国人民的权利的号召。
    捷克斯洛伐克律师协会主席团通过决议，代表捷克斯洛伐克法律界抗议纽约联邦法院陪审团的判决。决议称，这一判决是法律史上空前未有的，因为这一判决使研究与宣传科学理论者都成了犯罪。
