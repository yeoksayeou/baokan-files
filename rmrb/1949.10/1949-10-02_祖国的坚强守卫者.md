　　The Motherland's Strong Guardians

　　The magnificent ranks of the People's Liberation Army's special forces were the focus of attention for the 300,000 attendees at the grand ceremony marking the founding of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China in Tiananmen Square, Beijing, on October 1st. From this magnificent procession, people saw the guarantee of carrying the revolution through to the end and thoroughly eliminating the remnants of imperialism and its running dogs, and the guarantee of further consolidating the people's country and the people's regime.

　　Here were motorized artillery units, anti-aircraft artillery units, and tank units... The artillery pieces participating in the review included American-made 15 cm and 10.5 cm howitzers, and 37 mm anti-aircraft guns; there were also Japanese-made Type 90 field guns, Type 38 field guns, and 75 mm anti-aircraft guns (other 15 cm heavy mortars, 82 mm mortars, 60 mm guns, Type 94 mountain guns, Type 14 mountain guns, rocket launchers, and anti-tank guns, etc., were not included). These cannons, all towed by trucks, were completely modernized. The tank contingent included American-made tanks, Japanese-made tanks, and American armored vehicles, etc.

　　Regarding the source of these weapons, the commanders, combatants, and political workers here all said in a humorous tone: "These were equipped for us by American imperialism and Japanese imperialism." Or they said: "This was transported to us by our transport captain, Chiang Kai-shek." That's right; you see, the cannons are from American and Japanese imperialism, the ammunition that comes with the cannons is all American, and the jeeps and other vehicles used for towing are all from America's largest Studebaker motor factory.”

　　The process of this modernized special forces unit going from nothing to something, from small to large, is like that of other units of the People's Liberation Army. It is a process of constantly seizing weapons from the enemy to equip oneself through countless bloody battles. The North China × Artillery Regiment, which participated in this review, is a representative example. They were a small artillery team established when the People's Liberation Army liberated Zhangjiakou in 1945, capturing a few cannons. They were thrown into battle before personnel and horses were trained and the artillery technology was mastered. However, after the Sui-East, Huailai, Zhengtai, Qingcang, and successive Baoding South and North campaigns, Qingfengdian, Shijiazhuang, Mancheng South, Taiyuan, Chahar South, Jidong... and many other campaigns, their cannons increased many times over, and most of them were already equipped with American weapons. There have also been many new creations in tactics. The accuracy of shooting generally reached the point where the first shot hit the target.

　　The 5th Artillery Company of a certain regiment (now called the 1st Company) was established in a similar way. Initially (in 1945), they only had three field guns. However, they used the battlefield as a training ground, quickly mastered new technologies, and developed even higher technologies. Before the decisive battle of the Taiyuan Campaign, they persisted in a hard battle on the Taiyuan front for six months and twenty days, effectively controlling six enemy airfields in Taiyuan, destroying nine enemy planes. In order to escape the bombardment of this company, the enemy successively transferred six airfields, but each time they failed to escape. Our gunners continuously hit them from more than 15,000 meters (30 li) away without moving the gun positions, creating a miracle of artillery warfare. The enemy's forward positions were very close to these three cannons, and they fired hundreds of shells every day; in the most intense three or four days, more than 1,400 shells fell around them every day. However, thanks to the clever use of fortifications and camouflage, they always stood firm on the same position and were not hit. The enemy sent troops to scout at night and sent planes to bomb, all to no avail, and the heroic soldiers became tempered and became more calm and determined. They used the gaps in the war to help the local people harvest autumn crops and carry water, and also study culture; in half a year, the company published 73 issues of small battlefield newspapers, helping soldiers to study hard, and in half a year, illiteracy was eliminated and everyone became literate. Now, these three field guns, battle-hardened and carrying ninety scars, finally form a magnificent procession many times stronger than before, lined up with new guns seized from the enemy in the Taiyuan, Liaoxi, Pingjin, and Shenyang campaigns, to jointly celebrate the grand ceremony of the founding of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China.

　　What use could three cannons be in the hands of the enemy? What use could a hundred cannons be? From large to small, from small to nothing, that is the enemy's law. However, once they are transferred to the hands of the people, they will exert infinite power. From nothing, we can get to something, from small we can get to large, and from large, of course, we can get to even larger. Now we can not only seize weapons from the enemy, but also have many factories manufacturing our own weapons. So, as long as we continue to work hard, is there anything that Chairman Mao and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference have called for and expected in terms of a strong national defense that we cannot achieve?

　　Now, the anti-aircraft artillery units and tank units, which were established relatively late, are also stepping up their study of technology, preparing to meet any domestic and foreign reactionary forces that dare to invade and disrupt our people's motherland. The six-week study movement launched by the anti-aircraft artillery units in March has made technical progress equivalent to a year and a half of the enemy's progress, which surprised even the technical officers who were liberated, these old rough workers and peasants learn faster than educated people. The reason is actually very simple, that is, a highly conscious spirit of learning. In order to quickly master the technology, many people automatically postponed their weddings and refused their parents' urging. They wrote some important formulas and rules on their arms and worked hard day and night in shifts, practicing and discussing. This fanatical, highly conscious, and persistent learning will enable these modern weapons to exert the highest power and constitute an unshakable national defense force for the people's motherland.

　　祖国的坚强守卫者
    人民解放军特种兵部队的雄伟行列，是十月一日在北京天安门广场举行的中华人民共和国中央人民政府成立盛典中三十万到会者集中注目的行列。人们从这个雄伟的行列中，看到将革命进行到底、彻底肃清帝国主义及其走狗的残余势力的保证，看到进一步巩固人民国家与人民政权的保证。
    这里有机动炮部队，有高射炮部队，也有战车部队……参加检阅的大炮中，包括美国造的十五公分口径和十公分五口径的榴弹炮，三七高射炮；也有日本造的九零野炮，三八野炮，七五高射炮（其他十五生的重迫击炮、八二迫击炮、六零炮、九四山炮、一四山炮、火箭炮、战防炮等，均不在内）。这些炮均由汽车牵引，是完全近代化的。战车队，则包括美造坦克、日造坦克、美国装甲汽车等。
    这些武器的来源，这儿的指挥员、战斗员和政工人员都用诙谐的语调说：“这是美国帝国主义和日本帝国主义给咱装备的。”或者说：“这是咱们的运输队长蒋介石运送给咱们的。”一点不错；你看，炮是美国和日本帝国主义的，随炮所带的弹药全部是美国的，牵引用的大小吉普与其他汽车也都是出自美国最大的司多白克摩托厂。”
    这个近代化的特种兵部队的从无到有、从小到大的过程，也和人民解放军的其他部队一样，是经过无数次的浴血奋战，不断地从敌人手里夺来武器装备自己的过程。这次参加检阅的华北×炮兵团，即是有代表性的例子。他们是一九四五年人民解放军解放张家口时缴获了几门炮才成立起来的小小炮队，在人员马匹无训练、大炮技术还不能掌握之时即投入战斗。但是，他们经过绥东、怀来战役、正太、青沧、历次的保（定）南保北战役、清风店、石家庄、满（城）南、太原、察南、冀东……等多次战役，他们的大炮增加了好多倍，而且大部已美械化了。战术上也有了许多新创造。射击的准确性一般都达到了第一发就命中。
    某团的炮五连（现称一连），成立的经过也和上述情形差不多。最初（一九四五年）只有三门野炮。但是，他们以战场为练兵场，迅速地掌握了新的技术，并发展了更高的技术。太原战役决战以前，他们在太原前线以劣势地位坚持过六个月另二十天的苦战，他们有效地控制太原敌之六个机场，前后击毁敌机九架。敌人为逃开这个连的轰击，曾连续转移过六个机场，但每次均未逃掉。我们的炮手，在一万五千多公尺（合三十华里）之外，不移炮位地连续击中了它们，创造了炮战的奇迹。敌人的前沿阵地离这三门炮很近，每天都用几百发炮弹来打；最紧张的三、四天里，每天落在他们前后左右的炮弹达到一千四百多发，而由于工事和伪装的巧妙运用，他们始终屹立于同一阵地，未被击中。敌人派兵来夜摸，派飞机来轰炸，都归失败，而英勇的战士们却百炼成钢，越发沉着坚定了。他们利用战争的空隙帮助驻地群众收秋、担水，也学习文化；连队在半年中出阵地小报出到七十三期，帮战士加紧学习、半年内竟达到了文盲消灭、人人识字。而今，这三门身经百战、带着九十处伤疤的野炮，终于和太原、辽西、平津、沈阳等各次战役中夺自敌手的新炮并排地构成比当时强大许多倍的雄伟行列，来共同庆祝中华人民共和国中央人民政府的成立盛典了。
    三门炮，在敌人手里的时候能顶什么用呢？百门炮，又顶什么用呢？从大到小、从小到无就是敌人的规律。但是，一经转到人民之手，就会发挥无穷的威力。从无可以到有，从小可以到大，从大当然可以到更大。现在我们不仅能从敌人手里夺得，而且有了许多自造武器的工厂，那么，毛主席和人民政协所号召、所预期的强固的国防，只要继续努力，还有达不到的吗？
    现在，成立较晚的高射炮部队和战车部队也已在加紧学习技术，准备迎击任何胆敢侵犯和捣乱我们人民祖国的国内外反动势力。高射炮部队三月份发动的六礼拜学习运动，技术的进展已相当于敌军一年半的成绩，使解放过来的技术军官都感到惊奇，这些老粗工农比有文化的人还学习得快。原因其实很简单，这就是高度自觉的学习精神。他们为了迅速掌握技术，好些人把结婚都自动推迟，拒绝了父母的催促。他们把若干重要的公式与法则写在胳膊上，不分昼夜地轮流苦练，练了又讨论。这种狂热的、高度自觉的坚持不懈的学习，将使这些近代化的武器发挥最高的威力，构成人民祖国不可撼摇的国防力量。
