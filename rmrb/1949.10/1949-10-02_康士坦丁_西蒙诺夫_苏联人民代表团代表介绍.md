Konstantin Simonov

Introduction to the Representative of the Soviet People's Delegation

Compiled by Zhuma

Simonov is a writer who grew up with the Soviet system and now stands at the summit of the world literary scene. He is a famous Soviet novelist, an outstanding playwright, a talented poet, and a tireless war correspondent.

Simonov was born in Petrograd, now Leningrad. He was born in 1915 and attended middle school in Ryazan and Saratov. From 1930 to 1935, he worked as a lathe operator in factories in Saratov and Moscow. In 1930, he was admitted to the evening school of the Literary Institute affiliated with the Soviet Writers' Association, and later transferred to the undergraduate program, graduating in 1931.

Simonov entered the literary world as a poet. As early as 1934, he published his first poems. In 1938, his first major work, "Pavel Chorny," was published, followed by "Modern Man," "Collection of Poems in 1939," "Battle on the Ice" (epic), "Suvorov," "Five Pages," and "First Love."

In 1939, when Japanese imperialism invaded the Republic of Outer Mongolia, he went to the battle of Halhin Gol as a war correspondent. During the war against the Finnish White Army (1939-40), he traveled on the Soviet-Finnish front.

In 1940, he wrote the play "A Lad from Our Town," which caused a national sensation, telling the story of the growth of an ordinary Soviet youth. This work won the Stalin Prize in 1942.

In 1941, the German fascist bandits broke into the Soviet Union. Simonov, like other writers, once again galloped onto the battlefield. His creative talent was fully utilized in this great war, showing that he was not only a poet, playwright, and journalist, but also a novelist.

He served as a special correspondent for the "Red Star" newspaper, traversing various fronts as a lieutenant colonel. His combat novels, essays, poems... were published in various national publications and were later collected into several separate volumes: "From the Black Sea to the Barents Sea," "Yugoslav Notes," "Wartime Poetry," "With You and Without You."

Simonov did not interrupt his work as a playwright during the war. The two plays, "So It Will Be" and "The Russian People," were performed in almost every theater in the Soviet Union. "The Russian People" was even telegraphed to the United States, because the American people were eager to know about the heroic Soviet people's fight to defend their country. In 1942, Simonov won the Stalin Prize for the second time for the play "The Russian People."

Simonov wrote a novella "Days and Nights" based on the fresh wounds of the war, recounting the heroic defenders of Stalingrad. Later it was made into a movie and adapted into a play. Simonov won the Stalin Prize for the third time for this novel.

Simonov followed the army to Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Germany, and Finland. After the war, he also visited Japan, the United States, France, and the United Kingdom. He saw the lives of two societies with his own eyes. His life and experiences abroad were reflected in many of his works and prompted him to write "Under the Chestnut Trees of Prague" (play), "The Russian Question" (play), "Smoke of the Fatherland" (novella), and "Friends and Enemies" (poems).

"Under the Chestnut Trees of Prague" describes the liberation of Czechoslovakia by the Soviets. "The Russian Question" portrays the lackeys of Wall Street's hired newspapers and the real American people. It gave a timely blow to the anti-Soviet clamor of the American tycoons at that time. This play won Simonov the Stalin Prize for the fourth time.

"Smoke of the Fatherland" (written in 1947) depicts a Russian technician who has lived abroad for a long time returning to his hometown. He saw that everything in his motherland was different from before. Simonov used the protagonist's eyes to compare the old society (foreign countries) with the new society of the Soviet Union.

Simonov's last published work is "Friends and Enemies" (written in 1948). Each poem in "Friends and Enemies" explains a small story in a political event, reflecting two irreconcilable hostile worlds.

In these lines of poetry, Simonov praised the working people and the fighters for freedom. Here, there are people of various nationalities, American communists, German actors, fighters of the Spanish International Brigade, and leaders of the Japanese Communist Party. He exposed the high-ranking officials and dignitaries who fled the United States, the war profiteers, and the enemies of the people.

Simonov is a Bolshevik. He once called these poems jottings. He used a clear political mind to analyze all the beasts cloaked in the civilization of capitalism. He said, "Facts are important, but ideas are even more important."

Simonov has extraordinary talents in creative writing. He constantly collects new impressions and responds quickly to urgent current issues. He can grasp the thoughts and emotions of ordinary people at the right time and provide answers immediately with artistic images. His works have played a great role in the education of the people.

Simonov not only has outstanding achievements in literature, but his heroic spirit is also worthy of public admiration. He actively participated in frontline work. The Soviet government awarded him a "Red Banner Medal" and two "First Class Patriotic War Merit" medals as a reward.

Simonov is famous in the Soviet Union as a poet, playwright, novelist, critic, and tireless military special correspondent. Therefore, the Soviet people have a high degree of faith in him. In 1946, he was elected as a representative of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.

The total number of Simonov's works published (1934-1946) - in Russian and other national languages of the Soviet Union - reached more than 11.1 million copies.

Simonov is now the Deputy Secretary-General of the Soviet Writers' Union and the editor-in-chief of the "New World" literary magazine. (Reprinted from the 20th issue of the "Soviet Introduction" monthly)

    苏联人民代表团代表介绍
    竹马编译
    西蒙诺夫是随着苏维埃制度生长起来的作家，如今屹立在世界文坛的上峰。他是苏联著名的小说家，杰出的剧作家，天才的诗人，不倦的战地记者。
    西蒙诺夫是彼得格勒人，即今之列宁格勒人。他生于一九一五年，在梁赞和萨拉托夫市念过中学。于一九三○年到一九三五年，他在萨拉托夫和莫斯科的工厂里当过旋盘工。一九三○年他考入苏联作家协会附属的文学研究院夜校，后来转入本科，直至一九三一年毕业。
    西蒙诺夫以诗人的姿态走上文坛。远在一九三四年，他发表了第一篇诗作。一九三八年他的第一部大作“巴维·乔尔奈”问世了，相继又出版了“现代人”、“一九三九年诗集”、“冰湖之战”（史诗）、“苏沃罗夫”、“五页”、“初恋”。
    一九三九年，日本帝国主义进攻外蒙共和国时，他以战地记者资格，走上哈勒欣湖的战斗。反对芬兰白军时（一九三九年——四○年），他又辗转在苏芬战场上。
    一九四○年，他写成轰动全国的剧本“故乡少年”，叙说一个普通苏联青年的成长。这部作品荣膺了一九四二年斯大林奖金。
    一九四一年，德国法西斯匪帮闯入苏维埃联邦。西蒙诺夫和其他文学家一样，再度骋驰疆场之上。他的创作才能在这次大战里完全发挥出来了。表现出他不仅是位诗人、剧作家、记者，而且还是一位小说家。
    他担负着“红星报”的战地特派员的职务，以中校作身分踏遍各战线。他的战斗小说、散文、诗……发表在全国各种刊物上，后来集成几个单行本：“从黑海到巴伦支海”，“南斯拉夫杂记”，“战时诗抄”，“跟着你和离开你”。
    西蒙诺夫在战时并没有间断作剧本的工作。“就会这样的”与“俄罗斯人”两剧，几乎在苏联每个剧场都演出过。“俄罗斯人”一剧竟是拍电报传到美国去，因为当时美国人民极急知道苏联人民英勇卫国战斗。一九四二年，西蒙诺夫因“俄罗斯人”一剧第二次荣膺了斯大林奖金。
    西蒙诺夫根据战争的鲜痕写了一部倾诉斯大林格勒英勇保卫者的中篇小说“日日夜夜”。后来它被拍成电影，改编成剧本。西蒙诺夫因这部小说第三次膺得了斯大林奖金。
    西蒙诺夫随军到过罗马尼亚、匈牙利、保加利亚、南斯拉夫、奥地利、捷克斯拉夫、波兰、德国、芬兰诸国。战后他又访问了日本、美国、法国和英国。他亲眼看到了两种社会的生活。他在国外的生活、见闻，在许多创作中有了反映，并促使他写成“在布拉格的栗子树下”（剧本），“俄罗斯问题”（剧本），“祖国炊烟”（中篇小说）和“朋友和敌人”（诗）。
    “在布拉格栗子树下”是描写苏维埃人解放捷克斯拉伐克的情形。“俄罗斯问题”刻划出美国华尔街御用报馆的走狗和真正的美国老百姓。它及时地给了当时美国大亨们反苏叫嚣分子一个当头棒。这部剧本使西蒙诺夫第四次荣膺了斯大林奖金。
    “祖国炊烟”（一九四七年著）描写一个久居异国的俄罗斯技士返回故乡来了。他看清祖国的一切和从前不同了。西蒙诺夫用主人翁的眼睛，把旧社会（外国）和新社会苏联作一个对照。
    西蒙诺夫最后发表的作品，是“朋友和敌人”（一九四八年著）。“朋友和敌人”中的每一首诗都说明政治事件中的一个小故事，反映了两个不可妥协的敌对的世界。
    西蒙诺夫在这些诗行中，歌颂了劳动人民和争取自由的战士。这里，有各种民族的人，有美国共产党员，有德国演员，有西班牙国际战线的斗士，有日本共产党的领导者。他暴露了美国逃亡的高官显宦，战争贩子，人民的仇敌。
    西蒙诺夫是一位布尔什维克，他曾把这些诗称为杂记，他用清晰的政治头脑分析了一切披着资本主义文明外衣的野兽。他说过：“事实固然重要，思想尤其重要”。
    西蒙诺夫在创作方面有着非常的才能。他经常搜罗新的印象，对当前急迫的问题反映极快。他能适当其时地把握住一般人的思想情绪，并立刻用艺术的形象提供了解答。他的作品对于人民的教育，起了绝大的作用。
    西蒙诺夫不仅在文学方面有着昭著的成就，他的英雄气魄也是值得大众钦佩的。他积极地参加过火线工作，苏联政府赠予他一枚“红旗勋章”及两枚“一等爱国大战功劳者”勋章，以示褒奖。
    西蒙诺夫是以诗人、剧作家、小说家、评论家、不疲倦的军事特派记者驰名于苏联国内的。因此苏联人民对他有高度的信仰，一九四六年，他被选为苏联最高苏维埃代表。
    西蒙诺夫的作品出版的总册数（一九三四——一九四六年）——俄文的和苏维埃联盟其它民族语言的——共达一千一百余万册。
    西蒙诺夫现在是苏联作家联盟的副总书记，兼任“新世界”文学杂志的主编。（转载自“苏联介绍”月刊第二十期）
