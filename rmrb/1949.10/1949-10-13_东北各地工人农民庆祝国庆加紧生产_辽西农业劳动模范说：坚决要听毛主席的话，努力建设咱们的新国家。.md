Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 11th. Workers and peasants in Northeast China are intensifying their production efforts amidst the wave of celebrations for the founding of the People's Republic of China. All employees of the Fifth Manufacturing Plant of Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Factory used their spare time to produce two six-foot hanging lathes, and engraved the large characters "In Commemoration of the Founding of the People's Republic of China" to show their celebration. Workers at the HuangguTun Railway Factory are also actively repairing and manufacturing two typical locomotives as gifts to the Central People's Government. New record creators and meritorious workers at the Shenyang No. 5 Machine Tool Factory have expressed their determination to use their hands to intensify the transformation of tools, ensure an increase in labor efficiency by two to six times, and complete the production tasks for September and October within half a month as their congratulatory gift. Similar production upsurges have also been launched in Andong, Jinzhou, Qiqihar, Chengde, and other places. Workers of the three major state-owned enterprises in Andong City—paper making, textile, and rubber—have launched a "gift-giving" campaign. Chen Deshun, a weaving worker at the textile factory, wants to increase from watching four machines to watching six machines in half a month, and increase the daily amount of cloth woven from 43 yards to 45 yards. Fifteen members of the Communist Youth League in the factory have organized a "Youth Shock Brigade," with ten skilled workers preparing to lead the other five workers to strive to watch four machines each. Shen Dianxiang, an old worker in the fine yarn cloth workshop, said to the young workers: "My gift is that if you want to learn any technology, I will guarantee to teach you." Li Molin, a first-class labor model at the Qiqihar Sack Factory, resolutely stated that he would repair more than 30 broken spinning machines in the factory within two days to increase production. Workers at the Qiqihar Flour Mill Factory collectively contributed twelve hours of labor. Workers at the Electric Power Bureau guaranteed to reduce coal consumption and increase the power generation of Boiler No. 3 from 1,600-1,700 kilowatts to 2,800 kilowatts.

　　The good news of the founding ceremony of the People's Republic of China has made the farmers, who are busy with the autumn harvest, even more excited. Rural areas in Liaoxi Province have expressed their celebration by speeding up the autumn harvest, developing sideline occupations, and preparing for next year's major production. After hearing the good news of the founding of the country, the farmers in Xiaojiagou Village, Beizhen County, immediately launched a harvest upsurge. One hundred and eight women went to the fields to participate in labor, and manpower was allocated to organize the transportation and sale of sideline products. Cao Guochen, a first-class agricultural labor model in Liaoxi Province, said: "This time, the people have something to rely on and have taken root. We must resolutely listen to Chairman Mao, speed up production, and build our new country." Guo Yulan, a special-class female labor model in Heilongjiang Province who attended the National Youth Congress, wrote a letter to the local newspaper saying: "I am so happy that I don't know what to say. I wholeheartedly support our government. I am still young and strong, and I must work hard to produce and study well, and contribute to building a new China."

    辽西农业劳动模范说：坚决要听毛主席的话，努力建设咱们的新国家。
    【新华社沈阳十一日电】东北各地的工人和农民在连日庆祝中华人民共和国诞生的热潮中，生产工作更形加紧。沈阳第一机械第五制造厂全体职工利用工余时间做出两台六尺吊挂车床，并刻上“中华人民共和国成立纪念”的大字，以示庆祝。皇姑屯铁路工厂工人也正在积极修造两台典型机车，作为送给中央人民政府的礼物。沈阳第五机械厂的新纪录创造者和功臣们则纷纷表示要用双手加紧改造工具，保证提高劳动效率二倍到六倍，在半个月内完成九、十两月份生产任务，作为他们的贺礼。在安东、锦州、齐齐哈尔、承德等地，也掀起了同样的生产热潮。安东市造纸、纺织、胶皮三大国营企业职工，展开了“献礼”运动。纺织厂织布工人陈德顺要在半个月中从看四台机器增加到能看六台机器，每天织布量从四十三码提高到四十五码。该厂十五个青年团员并组织“青年突击队”，其中十名熟练工人准备带领其他五个工人争取一律能看四台机器。细纱布老工友沈殿祥对青年工人说：“我的献礼就是你们要学什么技术，我就保证教给你们。”齐齐哈尔麻袋厂一等劳动模范李墨林坚决表示要在两天内把厂内三十多台坏纺线机修好，以增加产量。齐齐哈尔火磨工厂工人，全体献工十二小时。电业局工人保证减少烧煤量，并使三号锅炉由发电一千六、七百基罗瓦特增至两千八百基罗瓦特。
    中华人民共和国开国大典的喜讯传到农村，正在忙于秋收的农民们加倍兴奋。辽西省各地农村纷纷以加紧秋收，发展副业，准备明年大生产来表示庆祝。北镇县萧家沟村农民听到开国喜讯后，立刻掀起收割热潮，一百零八名妇女下地参加劳动，并抽出人力组织运销副业。辽西省一等农业劳动模范曹国臣说：“这回人民有了靠出，扎下老根了，我们坚决要听毛主席的话，加紧生产，建设咱们的新国家。”黑龙江省特等妇女劳动模范出席全国青年代表大会的郭玉兰写信给当地报纸说：“我高兴得不知说啥是好，我从心里拥护咱们的政府，我还年青力壮，一定要努力生产，好好学习，为建设新中国出力。”
