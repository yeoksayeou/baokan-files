Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 28th: The Shanghai Municipal Women's Congress has passed the "Resolution on Future Women's Work in Shanghai." The resolution first determines that the future Shanghai women's movement should be based on female workers, boldly mobilizing and organizing working women, striving for intellectual women, and widely uniting women from all walks of life to overcome current difficulties, smash the enemy's blockade, support the liberation war, and actively participate in the construction of the new Shanghai as the central task. Mobilizing and organizing women to participate in Shanghai's various production and economic construction efforts is the key to completing the central task and promoting all work.

Shanghai is the most concentrated area of female workers. Female workers in light industry account for nearly 75 percent of the country's total. Therefore, doing a good job in Shanghai's female worker work is equivalent to doing most of the country's female worker work. The key to doing a good job in female worker work is to first conduct class education and gender equality education among male and female workers, breaking the feudal remnants of thought that have been reflected in workers' minds for thousands of years, such as the idea of valuing men over women, and the idea in female workers' minds of relying on men to run trade unions. Gradually improve and organize factory nurseries, laundry services, workers' dormitories, public canteens, and other workers' welfare undertakings to reduce the burden of housework and childcare on female workers. Cultivate and absorb a large number of female worker cadres and activists to participate in trade union work, persuade and solicit a large number or even all female workers to join trade unions.

Regarding women's work in rural suburban areas, the resolution points out: The leadership should consciously and systematically connect urban and rural female workers through the municipal trade unions and suburban farmers' associations to form a solid alliance and create a solid foundation for uniting women from all walks of life. In the early stages of the peasant movement, special emphasis should be placed on the common demands of farmers, and not on the special interests of women, and female farmers should be organized to participate in farmers' associations. After the work is more in-depth and the masses' awareness reaches a certain level, in coordination with the development of the entire movement, the issue of gender equality, freedom of marriage, and special demands of women should be raised.

Regarding the work of intellectual women, the resolution points out: First of all, intellectual women should be organized to transform their thinking and establish a world outlook of serving workers and peasants. They should strengthen their studies, continuously improve their scientific skills, engage in various construction tasks, combine with workers and peasants, serve workers and peasants, improve the cultural, political and technical level of workers and peasants, and cultivate new intellectual women from workers and peasants. Women in Party, government, and military organs should give full play to their strength in their respective work positions. Female comrades who have been engaged in revolutionary work for a long time should play a leading and guaranteeing role, and organize and educate women in their own organs.

Regarding family women's work, the resolution points out: There are approximately one million family women in Shanghai, many of whom are unemployed, out-of-school women and housewives. They must be widely organized. Family women should, under the principle of appropriately taking care of housework and children, combine their intelligence, financial resources, and manpower to participate in various production and construction undertakings as much as possible, improve the social status of family women, gradually solve the problem of unemployment and out-of-school, and enhance the construction strength of the new Shanghai.

Regarding the issue of women's organizations, the resolution points out: The Shanghai Democratic Women's Federation Preparatory Committee is the central hub of various unified organizations of democratic women's groups and women from all walks of life in Shanghai. Women from all walks of life are organized according to their nature, class, and system to avoid duplication and maintain close contact and cooperation with the Women's Federation Preparatory Committee in terms of ideology and work in order to facilitate the use of all forces to promote women's work as a whole.

Regarding future work, the resolution emphasizes: First, strictly prevent closed-doorism. All women in Shanghai, regardless of class, belief, ethnicity, cultural level, degree of awareness, age, experience, or ability, as long as they recognize the purpose and regulations of the Democratic Women's Federation, are willing to implement common resolutions, and participate in various women's organizations under the jurisdiction of the Democratic Women's Federation under the principle of voluntarism. Second, prevent formalism and establish a work style of seeking truth from facts, going deep into the masses, and meticulous work. Third, strictly prevent bureaucratic styles such as monopoly, substitution, coercion, and commandism. Correctly apply the principle of democratic centralism, give full play to the spirit of democracy, widely collect opinions and criticisms from all parties, and establish a regular representative conference system to report on work to everyone on a regular basis.

　　上海妇代会通过　
    今后上海妇女工作的决议
    【新华社上海二十八日电】沪市各界妇女代表会议已通过“今后上海妇女工作的决议”。该决议首先确定：今后上海妇女运动，应以女工为基础，放手发动和组织劳动妇女，争取知识妇女，并广泛团结各阶层妇女，克服当前困难，粉碎敌人封锁，支援解放战争，积极参加新上海建设，作为中心任务；而发动和组织妇女参加上海各项生产经济建设，为完成中心任务和推动一切工作的关键。
    上海是女工最集中的地区，轻工业女工几占全国轻工业女工百分之七十五，因此，做好了上海女工工作，即等于做好了全国女工工作的绝大部分。做好女工工作的关键，首先应在男女工人中进行阶级教育和男女平等的教育，打破数千年来封建余毒反映在工人中的重男轻女思想及反映到女工头脑中的依赖男人办工会的思想；并逐步改善与举办工厂托儿所、洗衣作、工人宿舍、公共食堂等工人福利事业，减少女工家事与育儿的牵累；培养并吸收大批女工干部和积极分子参加工会工作，说服与征求大量以至全体女工参加工会。
    关于郊区农村妇女工作，决议指出：领导上应有意识有计划地通过市内工会和市郊农会，将工农妇女结成巩固联盟，造成团结各阶层妇女的坚固基础。在农民运动初期，要特别强调农民的共同要求，不要强调妇女特殊利益，组织农妇参加农会。待工作比较深入，群众觉悟达到一定程度，在配合整个运动发展的过程中，再提出男女平等、婚烟自由和妇女特殊要求。
    关于知识妇女的工作，决议指出：首先应该把知识妇女组织起来，改造思想，确立为工农服务的人生观；加强学习，不断提高科学技能，从事各种建设工作，并与工农妇女结合，为工农妇女服务，提高工农妇女的文化、政治与技术水平，并培养工农出身的新知识妇女。党政军机关妇女在自己工作岗位上，应充分发挥力量。参加革命工作较久的女同志，应起推动和保证作用，组织教育本机关妇女。
    关于家庭妇女工作，决议指出：上海家庭妇女约有百余万人，其中不少是失业失学妇女和家庭劳动主妇，必须广泛组织起来。家庭妇女应在适当照顾家事与孩子的原则下，结合智力、财力、人力，尽可能的参加各种生产与建设事业，提高家庭妇女的社会地位，逐渐解决失业失学问题，增强新上海的建设力量。
    关于妇女组织问题，决议指出：上海民主妇联筹备会是上海各民主妇女团体和各界妇女的各种统一组织的总枢纽，各阶层妇女均按性质、阶层、系统组织起来，避免重复，在思想上、工作上与妇联筹备会密切联系与配合，以便于运用一切力量全盘推动妇女工作。
    关于今后工作，决议强调指出：第一、严防关门主义，全上海妇女，不分阶层、信仰、种族，不问文化高低、觉悟程度、年龄老少、经验有无、能力强弱，只要她们承认民主妇联的宗旨与章程，愿意执行共同决议，在自愿原则下，一律可以参加到民主妇联所辖的各种妇女组织中去。第二、防止形式主义作风，建立实事求是、深入群众、精雕细刻的工作作风。第三、严防包办、代替、强迫、命令等官僚主义作风，正确运用民主集中制原则，尽量发挥民主精神，广泛收集各方面的意见和批评，并建立经常的代表会议制度，定期向大家汇报工作。
