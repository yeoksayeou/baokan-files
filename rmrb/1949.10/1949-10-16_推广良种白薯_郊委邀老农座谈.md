　　Promoting Improved Sweet Potato Varieties
　　Suburban Committee Invites Veteran Farmers for Discussion
　　[This Municipality News] The Municipal Government's Suburban Work Committee recently decided to call on suburban farmers to purchase and store 195,000 jin of the Victory No. 100 superior sweet potato seedlings, in order to cultivate seedlings next spring and gradually expand the planting area. The required seedlings will be loaned to farmers by the Municipal Cooperative Bank through the cooperative in the form of a realistic loan. The North China Agricultural Science Research Institute is responsible for guiding the cultivation techniques. The "Victory No. 100" yields twice as much as ordinary sweet potatoes, producing 2,000 jin per mu, which is equivalent to the value of five mu of grain. This seedling is extremely popular among suburban farmers. In order to exchange experiences in sweet potato production, the Municipal Government's Suburban Committee, together with the Agricultural Research Institute, convened a symposium on October 10, inviting the heads of the construction sections of various districts in the suburbs and 28 experienced veteran farmers.

  　郊委邀老农座谈
    【本市讯】市府郊区工作委员会顷决定号召郊区农民购存胜利一○○号优良种薯十九万五千斤，以便明春养苗培秧，逐渐推广栽种面积。所需种薯由市合作银行以折实贷款的方式经由合作社贷给农民。栽培技术方面则由华北农业科学研究所负责指导。“胜利一○○号”的产量较普通白薯高出一倍，每亩可产二千斤，与五亩谷子的价值相等，此项种薯极为郊区农民所欢迎。为了交换生产白薯的经验，市府郊委会曾于十月十日会同农研所召集城郊各区建设科科长并邀请二十八位富有植薯经验的老农，举行座谈会。
