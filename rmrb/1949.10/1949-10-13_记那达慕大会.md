Remembering the Nadamo Fair
By our correspondent in Inner Mongolia, Ai Fang

I. With the Communist Party, Life Improves
Traveling southwest by car from Hailar, a small city in the northeastern corner of China, crossing the vast grasslands, after an eight-hour journey, one can see from afar a palace-like temple with glazed tiles shining brightly. This is the Ganjuur Temple of Hulunbuir.

This lonely temple is usually very quiet, but in recent days it has been somewhat different. Cars travel back and forth on the road to Hailar, carrying staff, theater troupe actors, as well as motors, loudspeakers, props, large quantities of cloth, grain, and daily necessities. Even the wooden poles and mats for building sheds are transported from three hundred miles away. Groups of merchants from various places, carrying their goods, and herders, bringing their cattle, sheep, and yurts, drive long strings of carts, moving here from all directions, converging into a lively gathering.

This gathering is a microcosm of Inner Mongolian society. What is displayed here ranges from the nomadic economy of grazing livestock to the commodity trade of furs and groceries in the cities; here young men and women hum Mongolian tunes as they walk by, and there are also open-air theaters and movies. Here, one can clearly see the process of development from simple and backward to progressive and advanced. And the gradual improvement of the Mongolian people's lives is due to the leadership of the Communist Party, which is the unanimous answer I received when visiting yurts.

II. The Road to "Prosperity for People and Livestock"
At the opening meeting on the first day, Comrade Chen Bingyu, the League Leader, called on everyone to achieve "prosperity for both people and livestock" as pointed out by Chairman Yunze, and emphasized promoting labor mutual aid, fire prevention, eliminating traitors, and launching sanitation campaigns. The government is always working to benefit the people and eliminate abuses, and these calls are being translated into concrete actions and implemented among the masses. The Mongolian people are working diligently under the leadership of the government to improve their lives, but some people still hold superstitious ideas, attempting to seek help from gods. The government has not forced them to abandon their beliefs, but during the conference, the government repeatedly conducted propaganda and education among the herders, explaining the way to "prosperity for both people and livestock" and "getting rich," and debunking superstitions. The government commended Mother Uyun, who has many children. This mother, who has raised nine children, was able to do so because she gave birth inside the yurt. She shattered the deceptive and superstitious propaganda promoted by feudal rulers to harm the Mongolian people, which claimed that women could not give birth inside the yurt because it would "offend the gods," resulting in large numbers of deaths of both children and adults. In the exhibition hall of the conference, there was a special exhibition of photographs and drawings on hygiene, which was crowded with visitors every day. Receptionists explained in detail the sources and treatments of various diseases, how to assist in childbirth, and how to care for infants.

Herders love their cattle and sheep; cattle and sheep are their livelihood. Due to backward conditions in various aspects, and being vulnerable to natural disasters, this has resulted in large losses of cattle and sheep. Wolves, epidemics, and sudden climate changes are enemies of cattle and sheep. Taking the Dongxi Sumu of Shengshan in West Xinba Banner as an example, last year, wolf attacks resulted in the loss of 3,000 sheep. In the summer, after shearing the wool, a heavy rain followed by a sudden cold snap froze more than 10,000 sheep to death. However, this year, under the leadership of the government, they have proactively overcome disasters, and the total losses for the year are less than 300. This year, the masses have already killed more than 1,400 wolves and broken the superstitious belief that "wolves are heavenly dogs, and you cannot kill them if they eat sheep." This year, the entire Hulunbuir League has implemented livestock immunization to prevent the occurrence of epidemics. The enthusiasm of the herders for production has generally increased, and as a result, the breeding of livestock is increasing day by day. The number of livestock on the grasslands of the entire Hulunbuir League has increased from more than 660,000 last year to more than 900,000 this year.

The herders love their horses even more. The Mongolian horses and the mixed breeds of Mongolian and Soviet horses exhibited at the conference, as well as the horses participating in the horse race, were all so strong and beautiful. The herders have rich experience in raising horses.

III. Horse Race
During the horse race, more than eighty horses, ridden by more than eighty children around ten years old, galloped from fifty li away, raising a cloud of dust on the grassland. Old people, young lads, and girls all came. As the horses approached the finish line, whistles and shouts erupted. The riders raised their whips, lying on the backs of the saddleless horses, the horses' hooves almost in a straight line with their bodies as they leaped forward. By a hair's breadth, thirteen-year-old Siwen, riding the foal of a Przewalski's horse, took the lead and won first place. This was the most intense scene. Horse riding, archery, and wrestling fully demonstrated the martial spirit of the Mongolian people.

IV. Joy for Improved Life
Throughout the conference, it proceeded joyfully. In addition to meetings and entertainment programs during the day, the herders spent their entire time in the cattle, sheep, and grocery market. Some people walked around smiling, with newly purchased long leather boots under their arms, and others holding various fabrics. In the evening, the lights in the yurts came on, and the mournful sound of the horse-head fiddle and the melodious songs floated from all directions. Later in the evening, people gathered in front of the stage to watch various dances, Mongolian plays, and movies.

Here, the joy of the initial improvement of the Inner Mongolian people's lives permeated everywhere.

　　记那达慕大会
    本报驻内蒙记者  艾方
    　　　　一　有了共产党生活就改善
    从中国东北角上的一座小城——海拉尔乘汽车向西南走，穿过辽阔的草原，经八小时的行程，即可远远了见一所琉璃瓦闪着亮光的宫殿式的庙宇，这就是呼伦贝尔的甘珠尔庙。
    这座孤零零的庙，平常很不热闹，但近些天来却有些不同，汽车往返于去海拉的道上，载着工作人员、剧团的演员、还有马达、扩音器、道具、大批的布匹、粮食和日用品，就是连搭棚的木杆和席子也是远从三百里外运来。各地成群结队的商人们，带了他们的货物，牧民们带了自己的牛羊和蒙古包，赶着长串的勒勒车，从四面八方向这里移动着，汇集成一个热闹的集会。
    这个会，是内蒙社会的缩影。这里所表现出来的，从草地牧畜牛羊的游牧经济，到此地城市的皮毛杂货商品贸易；这里有青年男女哼着蒙古小调来往走过，也有露天剧场和电影。在这里可以清清楚楚的看到，由简单落后的，向着进步高级发展的过程。而蒙古人民生活的逐渐向上，是由于有了共产党的领导，这是记者在遍访蒙古包时，大家一致的答复。
    　　　　二　“人畜两旺”的道路
    第一天开幕会上，盟长陈炳宇同志号召大家，要做到云泽主席所指出的“人畜两旺”，必须提倡劳动互助，防火、锄奸、展开卫生运动。政府是时时刻刻为人民兴利除弊的，并把这些号召变成具体工作，贯彻到群众中去。蒙古人民为了要改善生活，他们在政府领导下，辛勤的劳动着，但仍有少数人存在着迷信思想，企图求助于神，政府并没有强制他们不信神，但政府在大会中，反复向牧民们进行了宣传教育工作，说明“人畜两旺”、“发财致富”之道，并揭破迷信。政府表扬了多子母亲乌云等。这个养活了九个孩子的母亲，她之所以能够养活孩子，是由于在蒙古包内生，她打破了封建统治者陷害蒙古人民的欺骗迷信宣传，说女人生孩子不能生在蒙古包内，“冲了神”不行，因而造成孩子大人大批死亡。在大会的展览室内，有关于卫生的专门照片图画展览，每日拥挤着参观的人们。招待员详细解说着各种病的来源及疗法，如何接生及如何保育等。
    牧民们热爱自己的牛羊，牛羊就是他们的生活。由于各方面条件落后，受自然灾害所侵袭，因而造成牛羊的大量损失。狼、疫病、气候的骤变与牛羊为敌，以西新巴旗圣山东西索木来说，去年狼害损失羊三千只，夏季，剪羊毛后，一次大雨气候骤冷，冻死一万多只羊，但今年在政府领导下主动克服灾害，一年损失总数不到三百只。今年群众已打狼一千四百余只。并打破了“狼是天狗，吃了羊不能打”的迷信说法。在呼纳盟今年全部实行了牲畜防疫注射，防止了疫病的发生，牧民们的生产积极性普遍提高，因此牲畜的繁殖逐日增加，全呼纳盟草地的牲畜，由去年的六十六万多头，增到今年的九十万头以上。
    牧民们更爱他们的马，在大会上展览的蒙古马和蒙古马同苏联马的混合种，以及参加赛马会的马，一个个都是那么膘壮而漂亮。牧民们对养马有丰富的经验。
    　　　　三　赛马会
    赛马的时候，八十多匹马由八十多个十来岁的娃娃驾驭着，从五十华里外奔驰而来，草原上卷起一阵尘土，人和马飞跃前去。无论老年人，年青的小伙子和姑娘们都来了，当群马接近终点的时候，口哨声呐喊声喧嚷起来，骑者扬起了鞭子，伏在没有鞍子的马背上，马的四蹄几乎与身子成一条直线地跃进着。一步之差，十三岁的娃娃斯问骑着普鲁希的马驹跑在了前面，荣获第一名。这是最紧张的一个场面。骑马、射箭、角力，充分表现出蒙古民族英武的气质。
    　　　　四　为生活改善而欢乐
    自始至终，大会是在愉快中进行的。白天开会和游艺节目之余，牧民们整个时间化在牛羊和杂货的市场上，人们有的腋下夹着新购的长筒皮鞋，有的拿着各种布匹，笑嘻嘻地走来走去。黄昏，蒙古包里灯火亮了，马头琴和着悠扬的歌声从各处飘起。再晚一些，人们就都偎在戏台前，去看各种舞蹈、蒙古话戏及电影。
    在这里，到处洋溢着内蒙人民生活初步改善后的欢乐。
