    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 19th] The capital today solemnly and warmly commemorated the 13th anniversary of Lu Xun's death. The commemoration meeting, initiated and prepared by twelve organizations including the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Youth Federation, the All-China Students' Federation, the All-China Women's Federation, and the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, the Beijing Federation of Middle and Primary School Teachers and Staff, and the Federation of University and College Teachers and Staff, was held at the National Grand Theater at 9:00 am. More than 1,000 literary and art workers, workers, youth, and women attended. The conference elected a presidium of 48 people, including Guo Moruo, Nie Rongzhen, Wu Yuzhang, Ma Xulun, Chen Boda, Mao Dun, Zhou Yang, Ding Ling, Feng Xuefeng, Xu Guangping, and Luo Changpei, with Guo Moruo as the executive chairman. After the entire assembly stood in silent tribute to Mr. Lu Xun, Chairman Guo Moruo delivered a speech. He first contrasted the situation where commemorating Lu Xun was prohibited under the oppression of the Kuomintang reactionary rule with today's free and enthusiastic grand gathering to commemorate Lu Xun, expressing boundless excitement. He called on everyone to learn Lu Xun's spirit of "fierce-browed, I coolly defy a thousand pointing fingers, head-bowed, I willingly serve the children." He said: Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the wise leader Chairman Mao, we must learn from Lu Xun's spirit, carry the revolutionary war through to the end, and rapidly build the People's Republic of China well.

    Following him, Wu Yuzhang, Chen Boda, Xu Guangping, Wei Jiangong representing university and college teachers and staff, and Xie Bangding representing the All-China Students' Federation spoke. Wu Yuzhang pointed out: Lu Xun's greatness lies in his firm stance on the proletariat's side, learning and mastering Marxism-Leninism, thus not only exposing the darkness but also pointing out the bright future for humanity. He resolutely trusted and learned from the Soviet Union. Today's intellectuals should deeply learn this spirit and use it to transform themselves. Chen Boda quoted Fadeyev, explaining that Lu Xun loved the Chinese people and used his achievements in combining thought and art to elevate Chinese culture a step further. He called on everyone to learn Lu Xun's down-to-earth and indomitable spirit to overcome difficulties in their work; and to learn from the Soviet Union with Lu Xun's spirit of pursuing truth. Lu Xun's widow, Xu Guangping, said: Lu Xun's life tells us that literary and art workers cannot be separated from the revolution and the leadership of the Communist Party. When we commemorate Lu Xun, we must be as loyal to the leadership of the Communist Party and the leadership of Chairman Mao as Lu Xun was. In their speeches, Wei Jiangong and Xie Bangding thanked Lu Xun for setting a good example for educators and pointing out a bright path for Chinese youth.

    During the meeting, excerpts from "The True Story of Ah Q" and the articles "On Justice" and "Faint Bloodstains" were recited. The conference also unanimously passed a resolution requesting the People's Government to erect Lu Xun bronze statues in appropriate locations in Beijing and Shanghai, and to organize Lu Xun's former residence and establish a Lu Xun Memorial Hall.

    Also: Tsinghua University, Peking University, Normal University, Literary Gazette, and People's Literature Publishing House have all held meetings to commemorate Lu Xun. Lu Xun's former residence is open today, and the Beijing Library is also holding a Lu Xun exhibition. Beijing newspapers have all published special Lu Xun commemoration issues, with Guo Moruo, Mao Dun, Hu Feng, and Li Helin writing poems and articles. The People's Daily also published an article on the front page editorial position written by the famous Soviet writer Fadeyev in Shanghai before returning to his country, entitled "On Lu Xun."

    [Reported by this newspaper] The "13th Anniversary Commemoration of Mr. Lu Xun's Death," jointly organized by the All-China Association of Fine Arts Workers and the National Art Academy, was held in the auditorium of the Art Academy yesterday (the 19th) at 2:00 pm.

    【新华社北京十九日电】首都今天庄严热烈地纪念鲁迅逝世十三周年。由全国的文联、总工会、青联、学联、妇联和北京市的工会、中小学教职员联合会、院校教职员联合会等十二个团体发起筹备的纪念大会，上午九时在国民大戏院举行。到会文艺工作者、工人、青年、妇女等一千多人。大会推选郭沫若、聂荣臻、吴玉章、马叙伦、陈伯达、茅盾、周扬、丁玲、冯雪峰、许广平、罗常培等四十八人为主席团，由郭沫若任执行主席。全体肃立向鲁迅先生默哀致敬后，主席郭沫若致词。他首先把在国民党反动统治的压迫下纪念鲁迅要受到禁止的情况和今天纪念鲁迅自由地热烈地的盛会作一对比，表示无限兴奋。他号召大家学习鲁迅的“横眉冷对千夫指，俯首甘为孺子牛”的精神。他说：我们要在中国共产党和英明的领袖毛主席的领导下，学习鲁迅的精神，把革命战争进行到底，把中华人民共和国迅速建设好。
    接着讲话的有吴玉章、陈伯达、许广平，院校教职联代表魏建功，学联代表谢邦定。吴玉章指出：鲁迅所以伟大，是由于他坚定地站到无产阶级的立场上，学习和掌握了马列主义，因此不仅揭露黑暗，而且指出了人类的光明前途。他坚决地信任并学习苏联。这种精神，今天的知识分子应该深刻学习，用以改造自己。陈伯达引用法捷耶夫的话，说明鲁迅是热爱中国人民，并用他思想上和艺术上互相结合的成就把中国文化提高了一步。他号召大家学习鲁迅踏实和坚强不屈的精神，去克服工作的困难；用鲁迅追求真理的精神，去学习苏联。鲁迅夫人许广平说：鲁迅毕生的生活告诉我们，文艺工作者离不开革命，离不开共产党的领导。我们纪念鲁迅，就要象鲁迅一样地忠诚于共产党的领导，毛主席的领导。魏建功和谢邦定的讲话中，感谢鲁迅给教育工作者立下了好的榜样，并为中国青年指示了光明的道路。
    会中曾朗诵了“阿Ｑ正传”的一段和“立论”、“淡淡的血痕”两文。大会并一致通过决议，请人民政府在北京和上海的适当地点建立鲁迅铜像和整理鲁迅故居、建立鲁迅纪念馆。
    又：清华大学、北京大学、师范大学、文艺报和人民文学社等均曾集会纪念。鲁迅故居今天开放，北京图书馆也举办鲁迅先生展览会。北京各报都出了鲁迅纪念专刊，撰写诗文者有郭沫若、茅盾、胡风、李何林等。人民日报并在头版社论地位刊登了苏联名作家法捷耶夫返国前在上海所写的“论鲁迅”一文。
    【本报讯】中华全国美术工作者协会和国立艺专联合举办的“鲁迅先生逝世十三周年纪念会”，昨天（十九日）下午两点钟，在艺专大礼堂举行，到有艺专师生，美协会员，和外界来宾共三百多人。主席艺专校长徐悲鸿致词后，接着即由李桦、王朝闻、蔡仪、蔡若虹等作专题报告，对于鲁迅先生在文学和美术，以及做人各方面，都有很扼要的叙述。大家一致希望：能从这一个纪念会开始，对于鲁迅先生的著作，生活态度，尤其是战斗精神，要好好地研究，好好地学习。
