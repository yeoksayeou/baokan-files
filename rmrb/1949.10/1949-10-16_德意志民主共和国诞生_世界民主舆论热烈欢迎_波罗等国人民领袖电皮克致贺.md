Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 15th: World democratic public opinion warmly welcomes the establishment of the German Democratic Republic. The French newspaper *l'Humanité* commented: From now on, Germany has a parliament. The young republic will be able to move forward. Seeing the great enthusiasm of the people, who can still doubt its future? The massive demonstration held in Berlin to celebrate President Pieck's election has caused confusion among those who attempt to describe the things happening in Berlin with completely different views. The People's Chamber has received tens of thousands of congratulatory letters from factories, mines, workshops, and villages. People can be sure that the government will take all measures to realize the tasks stipulated in the government declaration: to successfully implement the two-year plan and prepare a broader plan, to eliminate all attempts to revive fascism in Germany, and to insist on fighting to consolidate the world peace camp.

Polish newspapers unanimously emphasized the deep joy expressed in Poland when the news of the establishment of the German Democratic Republic was announced. *Tribuna Ludu* emphasized that it was precisely because the Soviet army defeated the fascist elements of the Hitlerites that it was possible to create conditions for launching a mass anti-fascist movement in Germany. The newspaper pointed out that the revival of German imperialism in the US, British, and French jointly occupied zones threatens the fundamental interests of Germany and its neighbors. To fight against the division of Germany, to fight against the Bonn separatist constitution, and also to fight against imperialism and war—these are the German national interests that are closely integrated with the interests of the entire peace camp.

The Secretary-General of the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Wierblowski, sent a special congratulatory telegram on the establishment of the German Democratic Republic, pointing out that Poland agrees with the idea of a unified Germany as the only sound basis for democratic construction in Germany, and hopes to see Germany eliminate the Junkers and big capitalists throughout the country, develop democratic forces, and eliminate the forces of imperialist reactionaries and revisionism.

The Chairman of the Presidium of the Romanian National Assembly, Parhon, sent a congratulatory telegram to German President Pieck, stating: "Our people are watching with great confidence the struggle of the democratic forces led by the working class of your country against fascism and militarism, which once plunged Europe into a bloody war. We wish you victory in your struggle and sincerely hope that democratic Germany will become a strong fortress in the peace camp led by the Soviet Union, resolutely fighting against the instigators of a new war." All Romanian newspapers welcomed the establishment of the German Democratic Republic and condemned the puppet government in Bonn. *Scînteia* wrote: The Romanian people believe that this republic is an important new force in the peace camp, and it will receive the full support of the Soviet Union, the people's democratic countries, and all peace-loving nations.

　　德意志民主共和国诞生
  　世界民主舆论热烈欢迎
    波罗等国人民领袖电皮克致贺
    【新华社北京十五日电】世界民主舆论热烈欢迎德意志民主共和国的成立。法国人道报评论称：从现在起德国有了一个国会。年青的共和国将能前进。看到人民的巨大热情，谁还能怀疑它的将来呢？庆贺皮克总统当选时在柏林所举行的大示威，已在那些企图以完全不同的看法来述说柏林所正在发生的各种事物的人们中引起混乱。人民议会接到来自各工厂、矿坑、工作间及各乡村的成千成万封贺函。人们可以确信，政府将采取一切措施实现政府宣言中所规定的任务：成功地执行两年计划，并准备更广泛的计划，肃清在德国复活法西斯主义的一切企图，坚持为巩固全世界的和平阵营而斗争。
    波兰报纸社论一致强调当德意志民主共和国成立的消息发表时，在波兰所表现的深切的高兴情绪。人民论坛报强调指出：正是由于苏军击溃了希特勒分子的法西斯主义，才能在德国创造开展群众反法西斯运动的条件，该报指出，在美英法三国联合占领区德帝国主义的复活威胁着德国及其邻邦的根本利益。为反对德国的分裂而斗争，为反对波恩分裂主义的宪法而斗争，而且也为反对帝国主义及战争而斗争——这些就是与整个和平阵营的利益密切结合在一起的德国民族利益。
    波兰外交部秘书长威尔勃洛夫斯基就德国民主共和国的成立特电庆贺，指出波兰赞同统一德国的观念为德国民主建设的唯一健全基础，并希望见到德国全国肃清容克家族和大资本家，发展民主力量，消灭帝国主义反动派和修界主义的势力。
    罗马尼亚国民议会主席团主席巴洪致电德总统皮克的贺电庆贺称：“我们的人民正以极大的信心注视着贵国工人阶级领导的民主力量反对曾把欧洲投入流血战争的法西斯主义和军国主义的斗争，我们祝你们斗争的胜利，并恳切地希望民主德国将成为苏联领导下的和平阵营中的强大堡垒，坚决地与新战争挑拨者战斗”。全罗马尼亚的报刊均欢迎德意志民主共和国的建立，并斥责波恩的傀儡政府。“火花报”写道：罗马尼亚人民认为这个共和国是和平阵营重要的生力军，它将受到苏联、人民民主国家及一切爱好和平的民族的全力支持。
