　　Congratulations to the National Xinhua Bookstore Publishing Conference
　　The opening of the National Xinhua Bookstore Publishing Conference is one of the major events on our country's cultural front. It marks the beginning of the nationwide unification of the national publishing industry in response to the new situation. The people's publishing industry in the liberated areas, which used to operate independently and in a decentralized manner, will gradually become a unified fighting whole of the People's Republic of China, and a strong leading backbone of the people's publishing industry. This conference provides an important guarantee for welcoming the new cultural upsurge of our people, and facilitates the realization of the major task stipulated in the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: "Develop the people's publishing industry, and focus on publishing popular books and newspapers that are beneficial to the people."
　　Vice Chairman Zhu De made a resounding call at the National Xinhua Bookstore Publishing Work Conference, urging everyone to make full preparations to welcome a cultural construction upsurge that is bound to come with the economic construction upsurge, and a vigorous development upsurge of the New Democratic publishing industry. This call should and must become the starting point for publishing work and all cultural and educational work. We must answer this call loudly with full courage and confidence.
　　It is very important to consciously attach importance to publishing work ideologically. Now, the nationwide production and construction undertaking is actively starting, and publishing work must serve the production undertaking. This is the primary task of the publishing industry today. For this reason, we must concentrate all our efforts on publicizing Mao Zedong Thought, publicizing the various basic policies of the Party and the People's Government, disseminating various experiences in production and construction, and carrying out cultural and scientific education around production. The publishing industry must keep pace with the upsurge of production and construction, work diligently, and strive to improve the theoretical and cultural level of cadres and the masses, and overcome the backwardness of our nation in culture, so as to better mobilize the strength of the whole nation and transform an agricultural country into an industrial country. Resolutely oppose the extremely backward and one-sided idea of ​​despising cultural work (including publishing work). We must always remember Chairman Mao's great instruction: "With the advent of the upsurge of economic construction, a upsurge of cultural construction will inevitably appear." We must strive to enable our people to "appear in the world as a nation with a high degree of culture."
　　Organizationally, we must implement the instruction of "uniting all those who are willing to serve the people to work together." The two teams of cultural publishing work in the liberated areas and the past Kuomintang-ruled areas must converge into a huge force to better work for the needs of the people. We must unite well with all private and joint public-private publishing industries that are beneficial to the people, and oppose the tendency of closed-doorism at all times and in all places. On the other hand, after the unification of the national Xinhua Bookstore publishing work, we should pay more attention to correcting the phenomena of disorganization, indiscipline, and acting on one's own that have occurred in the work of bookstores in various places in the past.
　　We hope that the unified Xinhua Bookstore can provide a good example for the national publishing industry in all aspects, establish a national unified modern publishing industry, further improve the organization and leadership of the publishing industry, increase the output of political, scientific, theoretical books, textbooks, and popular reading materials, and systematically meet the ever-increasing needs of cadres and people for cultural food.

　　祝全国新华书店出版会议
    全国新华书店出版会议开幕，是我国人民文化战线上重大的事件之一，它标志着全国出版事业适应着新的情况开始走向全国范围的统一。过去曾经分散地独立作战的解放区人民出版事业，从此将逐渐成为中华人民共和国统一的战斗整体，成为人民出版事业坚强的领导骨干。这次会议为迎接我国人民新的文化高潮提供了重要保证，便于实现人民政协共同纲领所规定的：“发展人民的出版事业，并注重出版有益于人民的通俗书报”底重大任务。
    朱德副主席在全国新华书店出版工作会议上响亮地号召大家，要作好充分的准备来迎接随着经济建设高潮而必然到来的一个文化建设高潮，一个蓬蓬勃勃发展起来的新民主主义出版事业的高潮。这一号召应该和必须成为出版工作以及一切文化教育工作的出发点。我们必须以充分的勇气和信心响亮地回答这一号召。
    从思想上自觉地重视出版工作是十分重要的。现在，全国规模的生产建设事业正在积极开始，出版工作必须为生产事业服务，这是今天出版事业第一位的任务。为此，就必须集中全力宣传毛泽东思想，宣传党和人民政府的各种基本政策，传播生产建设的各种经验，以及围绕着生产进行文化科学教育。出版事业必须紧紧随着生产建设高潮齐步前进，兢兢业业，努力提高干部群众理论文化水平，克服我们的民族在文化上的落后现象。以便更好地动员全民族力量，变农业国为工业国。坚决反对轻视文化工作（包括出版工作）的这一极端落后片面的思想。要时时记住毛主席伟大的指示：“随着经济建设的高潮的到来，不可避免地将要出现一个文化建设的高潮”，我们要努力使我国人民能够“以一个具有高度文化的民族出现于世界”。
    在组织上要贯彻“团结一切愿为人民服务者共同工作”的指示。解放区和过去国民党统治区两支文化出版工作的队伍必须汇合成一股巨大力量来更好地为人民的需要而工作，必须很好地团结一切有利于人民的私营的和公私合营的出版业，随时随地反对关门主义倾向。另一方面，在全国新华书店出版工作统一之后，更应十分注意纠正过去各地书店工作中曾经发生的无组织无纪律与各自为政的现象。
    我们希望统一的新华书店能在各个方面为全国出版事业提供良好榜样，建立全国统一的现代化的出版事业，进一步改善出版业的组织和领导，增加政治、科学、理论的书籍及教科书、通俗读物的产量，有计划地满足干部和人民的日益增长的对于文化食粮的需要。
