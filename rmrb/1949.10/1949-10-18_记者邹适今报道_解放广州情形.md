Reporter Zou Shijin Reports
  The Liberation of Guangzhou
    [Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 16th] Reporter Zou Shijin reported on the People's Liberation Army's liberation of Guangzhou, stating: When a unit of the Second Field Army of the People's Liberation Army moved south along the Yuehan Railway to liberate Qujiang and Yingde, a unit of the Fourth Field Army, in a continuous forced march of three days and nights, liberated Fogang County, north of Guangzhou, on the 11th, completely annihilating two regiments of the defending enemy. On the 12th, they eliminated a remnant bandit force entrenched in the Weigan Market area west of Conghua City, and before dawn on the 13th, they wiped out a battalion of the enemy guarding Aotou Market, north of Huaxian County, and liberated Huaxian City at dawn, completely annihilating the bandits defending the city. On the 14th, the vanguard of the Liberation Army reached the Xin Jie and Ren He Market areas on the outskirts of Guangzhou.

    The bandits Xue Yue, Yu Hanmou, and others, entrenched in Guangzhou, even clamored on the 10th that they were "determined to defend Guangzhou to the death," and on the 11th, they even staged a "mass rally of all circles against communism." However, during this "anti-communist propaganda," the bandit leaders fled in panic to Hong Kong, Chongqing, Taiwan and other places. Chennault's "Civil Air Transport" of the American imperialist elements transported them day and night, with the Chongqing-Guangzhou flights returning to continue the transport after reaching Liuzhou. From the 12th onward, the bandit leaders scattered like frightened birds and beasts. The bandit Li Zongren fled to Guilin, the traitor Yan Xishan fled to Taipei, and the bandits Yu Hanmou and Xue Yue fled to Hainan Island by ship from Huangpu. The bandits said this was to "accelerate the implementation of the decentralized office plan."

    After the Liberation Army learned of the fleeing remnants, they disregarded the fatigue of driving more than 200 li continuously and advanced rapidly along the highways from Huaxian to Guangzhou and from Conghua to Guangzhou in multiple routes at around 3 PM on the 14th. The vanguard reached Shahe Market in the east of Guangzhou city area at around 5 PM.

    At this time, large numbers of enemy troops had fled the city area and were fleeing in the direction of the West River. A remnant of bandits remained in the city to provide cover, carrying out explosions, arson, and destroying bridges, warehouses, and airport facilities. People could see bursts of thick smoke and flames and hear the explosions shaking the roofs dozens of miles outside the city. The vanguard of the Liberation Army, in order to liberate the people and annihilate the remaining bandits as early as possible, and without waiting for the subsequent troops to arrive, immediately launched a fierce advance from Shahe Market through Huanghuagang to the Huiai Road area in the city center. In addition to sending troops to take over important institutions such as the puppet presidential palace, the puppet executive yuan, the puppet ministry of national defense, the puppet pacification headquarters, the puppet provincial government, and the puppet police headquarters, and guarding other important enterprises, they immediately divided their forces into several routes to pursue and suppress the remaining bandits. The Liberation Army intercepted over a thousand men of Liu Anqi's 207th Division of the 50th Army near the Huangsha Railway Station in the western district of the city. After four hours of fierce fighting, they were completely annihilated, and the enemy's ships and dozens of trucks loaded with materials, which had been loaded and were waiting to be transported at the Huangsha ferry, were seized. Another group of more than 500 bandits entrenched on boats on the Pearl River, attempting to resist stubbornly, were also wiped out by the Liberation Army at the same time.

    At this point, the organized resistance of the enemy troops ceased. The subsequent troops of the Liberation Army also poured into the city and immediately deployed, occupying all the main streets of Guangzhou by dawn on the 15th. Guangzhou, the city where the dying soul of the Kuomintang bandit government had lingered for five months, was completely liberated.

  　解放广州情形
    【新华社广州十六日电】记者邹适今报道人民解放军解放广州的情形称：当人民解放军第二野战军一部沿粤汉路南下解放曲江、英德的时候，第四野战军一部以连续三昼夜的奔袭，于十一日解放广州以北的佛冈县城，全歼守敌两团，十二日又将盘据从化城西山区桅杆墟的残匪一部消灭，十三日拂晓前解决了花县以北鳌头墟的守敌一营，并于拂晓时解放花县城，全歼城内守匪。十四日解放军先头部队即进抵广州外围的新街、人和墟一带地区。
    盘据广州的匪徒薛岳、余汉谋等十日那天还扬言要“决心死守广州”，十一日还扮演了一个“各界反共宣传大会”。可是，就在这“反共大宣传”的时候，匪首们即仓皇向香港、重庆和台湾等地逃命了。美帝国主义分子陈纳德的“民航大队”日夜不停地运送，渝穗班机飞到柳州后即折返续运。十二日起，匪首们即纷纷作鸟兽散，李匪宗仁逃往桂林，阎贼锡山逃向台北，余汉谋、薛岳二匪则由黄埔乘舰溜到海南岛去了。匪徒们说这是“加速实行分地办公计划”。
    解放军得知残匪正在逃跑的消息后，不顾连续行车二百多里的疲劳，于十四日下午三时许分路沿花县至广州和从化至广州的公路向前疾进，五时许先头部队即抵达广州市区东面的沙河墟。
    此时大股匪军已逃离市区，向西江方向溃逃，市内留有残匪一部作掩护，并进行爆炸，放火，破坏桥梁、仓库和飞机场等设备。人们在市区数十里外都可以看到一阵阵的浓烟烈火和听到震动屋瓦的爆炸声。解放军先头部队及早解放人民，歼灭残匪，不等后续部队到来，即由沙河墟经黄花冈向市中心惠爱路一带猛烈发展，除沿途派兵进驻伪总统府、伪行政院、伪国防部、伪绥靖公署、伪省政府、伪警察总局等重要机关和看守其他重要企业部门外，立即分兵数路，追剿残匪。解放军在市西区黄沙车站附近截住刘匪安祺所部五十军二零七师千余人，经四小时的激战，将其全部灭歼并缴获黄沙渡口匪军已经装好待运的轮船和满载物资的汽车数十辆。另部匪军五百余人盘据珠江江面船上企图顽抗，亦于同时被解放军扑灭。
    至此，匪军有组织的抵抗即告停止。解放军后续部队亦源源入城，并立即展开，于十五日拂晓占领了广州全部的一切主要街道。曾被国民党匪帮政府的死魂灵寄托了五个月的广州城，遂告完全解放。
