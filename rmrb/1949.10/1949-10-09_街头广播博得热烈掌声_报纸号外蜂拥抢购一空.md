    Street Broadcasts Elicit Enthusiastic Applause
    Newspaper Extras Sold Out in a Frenzy
    [Special dispatch from our Shanghai correspondent on the 3rd] When the news of the Soviet Union's recognition of our country reached Shanghai, people were extremely excited. At 5 p.m. today, just as thousands of workers, staff members, and students were parading and demonstrating to celebrate the founding of the Central People's Government and to support world peace, the extras from the Jiefang Daily and Wenhui Daily were immediately snapped up in a frenzied rush. The propaganda truck behind the Shanghai Municipal Direct Tax Bureau's parade team was specially equipped with loudspeakers broadcasting this good news. When the broadcaster announced in a loud and cheerful voice the news that the Soviet government had recognized our country and established diplomatic relations with us, the audience on both sides of the road and in the windows of the shops applauded in unison, expressing a warm welcome.
    In other news, according to Xinhua News Agency: Representatives from all sectors of Shanghai have successively issued statements expressing extreme welcome for the Soviet Union's friendly gesture. Liu Changsheng, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, said: The establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union signifies the Soviet Union's love and concern for the Chinese people. Today, the friendship and unity between the people of China and the Soviet Union are even more consolidated.

    报纸号外蜂拥抢购一空
    【本报记者上海三日专电】苏联承认我国的消息传到上海时，人们兴奋异常。今天下午五时正当成千成万的工人、职员、学生为庆祝中央人民政府成立暨拥护世界和平而游行示威时，解放日报及文汇报的号外，立即被蜂拥抢购一空。上海市直接税局游行队后面的宣传卡车，特别装置着扩音器广播这个喜讯。当广播员以洪亮而愉快的声音喊出苏联政府承认我国，和我们建立外交关系的消息时，马路两旁和商店的窗户上的观众一致鼓掌，表示热烈欢迎。
    又据新华社消息：上海市各界代表人物纷纷发表谈话，对于苏联的友谊举动备极欢迎。上海市总工会筹备委员会主任刘长胜说：中苏建立外交关系表示着苏联对中国人民的友爱和关怀，今天，中苏两国人民的友爱和团结更巩固了。
