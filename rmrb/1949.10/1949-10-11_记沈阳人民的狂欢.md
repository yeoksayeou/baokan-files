　　A Record of the Revelry of the People of Shenyang
　　By our correspondent in Shenyang, Le Fu

　　　　(1) Heartfelt Support, Glorious Welcome
　　The people of Shenyang City are inspired by constant celebrations and have been immersed in revelry for several days. As the news from the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) kept coming from the capital, the people of Shenyang were sending off their representatives to participate in the first People's Representative Conference of Shenyang City. The representatives sat in horse-drawn carriages, wearing glorious red flowers, driving on the clean streets. Following behind were Yangko dances and drums.
　　At this moment, the beloved Soviet cultural, artistic, and scientific workers delegation arrived. More than ten thousand young men and women, led by Li Fuchun and Lin Feng, went to the station to welcome them. When the train arrived, giant portraits of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin and red flags fluttered in the wind, the military band played the Internationale, and lively children swarmed to offer flowers. After leaving the station, the Soviet representatives declined to take a car and proceeded amidst cheers. Slogans such as "Welcome to the Soviet Delegation" and "Long Live Stalin" rose and fell with the friends' footsteps. The Soviet delegation, headed by Fadeyev, held flowers and waved their hats to respond to the welcoming crowd. At the enthusiastic welcome meeting, Simonov—the outstanding young Soviet writer—gave a warm speech to the Chinese people. He said, "We are very happy to pay tribute to you in Shenyang. This city of Shenyang has a tradition of resisting Japanese aggressors and American imperialists." The people of Shenyang felt proud and supremely honored.

　　　　(2) Lantern Parade
　　On October 1, 1949, on this unforgettable holiday, the entire city of Shenyang was decorated. Everyone wore new clothes, and speeding cars, trams, and carriages were all adorned with colorful decorations. Propaganda trucks and Yangko teams shuttled back and forth. At night, every household hung red lanterns, and a large-scale lantern parade began. The City Hall Square was filled with a continuous stream of people, and Taiyuan Street was so crowded that it was impenetrable. Performers at the South Railway Station Square followed one after another. A neon locomotive with alternating red and green lights was installed on the roof of the building in front of the station. The five-pointed star on the locomotive flickered on and off. On both sides stood two giant oil paintings of workers, peasants, and soldiers, sixteen or seventeen feet high, inscribed with "Eliminate all remnants of the Kuomintang bandits" and, written in both Chinese and Russian, "Defend World Peace Forever." The decorated tram was like a fiery dragon. Look! The long procession of the China Medical University, holding red lanterns in the shape of a Chinese map, sang majestic songs. Look! The workers of the South Station Engineering Section waved sickle lanterns and axe lanterns. Look! The nervous and excited expressions and high-pitched singing of the students of the Shenyang Veterans School. Here is Wang Xifa, who broke a leg in the Battle of Xiushuihezi, and here are many people's heroes from the battles of Jinzhou, Tianjin, Xuzhou, and other places.
　　Darkness was dispelled, and everywhere were lanterns of various colors—five-star lanterns, lotus lanterns, airplane lanterns, tank lanterns, red figure lanterns... The lights shone on the smiling faces of the crowd. The people rejoiced and celebrated because the Chinese people had finally stood up!

　　　　(3) Irresistible Force
　　After a night of revelry, on October 2, the city held an unprecedented grand rally and parade with 500,000 people.
　　With Zhongshan Square as the core, the parade route extended six or seven li along the three main streets radiating from the square. When the parade began at 10:15, magnificent formations passed the rostrum one after another. Six People's Liberation Army aircraft circled in the sky.
　　The stalwart soldiers of the Northeast People's Liberation Army, in neat uniforms, with synchronized steps, shining weapons, upright chests, and a solemn formation, demonstrated the invincible and strong will of the People's Liberation Army.
　　When the workers' contingents appeared before the people, coal miners dressed as if they were going down the mine. Railway workers pushed a wheel representing the history of the railways. The Vehicle Factory carried the award banners won in various campaigns—"Huadong," "Beiping," and "Nanjing"! The farm equipment factory pushed a decorated harvester and tractor. These laborers, who create everything, are the main force in building the new China.
　　In the student procession, the Shenyang Institute of Technology held a large globe on which the Soviet capital, Moscow, was marked with "Bastion of Peace," and the new Chinese capital, Beijing, was marked with a five-star red flag. The students of the Workers' Political University, marching arm in arm, wore red stars on their chests with the inscription "Defend World Peace." Nanchang Elementary School used their formation to spell out the words "Children stand up and create our new life."
　　The citizens' contingents also marched in an organized and orderly manner. People waved hats, shook flags, and roared with cheers. The Yangko team of housewives from Wanquan Street danced to their hearts' content, which was particularly eye-catching. Noteworthy was the contingent of Korean residents, wearing Korean clothes and performing Korean Yangko dances. Men beat hand drums, and women danced, chanting loudly, "Chinese and Korean people unite to defend world peace." Japanese residents held giant portraits of Stalin, Mao Zedong, and Tokuda Kyuichi, shouting: "Long live the People's Republic of China!" "Support the liberation movement of the oppressed peoples of the world!"
　　The procession turned from three lanes into six lanes, then nine lanes, surging forward, and the revelry boiled over throughout the city. This is an irresistible force. Let the imperialists and their running dogs be terrified!

　　　　(4) Step up Production and Learning to Welcome the New China
　　When the CPPCC opened in Beijing, factories, government agencies, and schools in Shenyang decided to step up production and learning to welcome the founding of the new China. Zhang Shuqin and Xi Chunkuai, female workers at the Shenyang Woolen Mill, said, "We must do a good job in production to express our inner joy and celebrate the founding of the new China." These words represent the will of all workers. Factories immediately launched a wave of dedicating their labor. In addition to ensuring the completion of the September work tasks, Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Factory also made collective and individual plans. The workers in the Second Workshop of the Third Machine Tool Factory each volunteered an extra hour. Preparation work was very tense in advance of the International Day for the Struggle for Peace on October 2. Rubber factory workers voluntarily worked two nights to complete a large hydrogen balloon with a diameter of six meters. The Xin Xin No. 1 Factory rushed to make 150 large firecrackers and another 300 to be sent to Beijing as a gift. A rostrum of five zhang high was completed in three days and nights of intensive work by 190 workers and 13 staff members of the Dongda Construction Company. More than a thousand employees of three clothing factories under the Third Quartermaster Bureau volunteered their labor to complete 6,000 national flags. Street cleaners worked day and night to keep the streets clean. A congratulatory letter from more than 7,000 employees of the Third Quartermaster Branch Factory stated: "In order to run the factory well, all factories have launched rationalization proposals, which have brought many improvements to the factory. The working class has grasped the power of the state. We will bravely shoulder this task, strive to develop production, and build a new Shenyang for the people."
　　When the 26th Propaganda Week began, the Shenyang Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and the Municipal Communist Youth League called on the city's 70,000 union members, 7,000 Communist Youth League members, and 70,000 university, middle school, and primary school students to earnestly study Chairman Mao's opening speech and editorials. The Northeast Daily convened its own forums for women, youth, and workers, and government agencies held meetings for cadres and all staff members. The Northeast Federation of Trade Unions and the Communist Youth League also sent people to lecture at various schools. Various training classes, universities, middle schools, and workers' night schools all used the CPPCC as the content of political lessons, holding large lectures and giving reports everywhere, launching enthusiastic learning.
　　The victory of the Chinese revolution has inspired the fighting spirit of the Japanese people. The Japanese residents in Shenyang, with joy, conveyed the news to their relatives, friends, and all acquaintances. Professor Matsubara of China Medical University said, "The Japanese people should learn from this. Without consolidating the people's revolutionary camp, we cannot defeat the reactionary forces and free the Japanese people from the abyss of suffering." Matsueda of the Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University said, "In the near future, that day will also come in Japan."

　　记沈阳人民的狂欢
    本报驻沈记者  乐夫
    　　　　（一）衷心的拥护，光荣的欢迎
    沈阳市的人民被不断的欢庆所鼓舞着，数日来一直沉浸在狂欢中，当人民政协的消息不断自首都传来的时候，沈阳人民正在欢送自己的代表，参加沈市第一次人民代表会。代表们坐在马车上，带着光荣的红花，在整洁的马路上行驶着。跟在后边的是秧歌与锣鼓。
    就在这时候，亲爱的苏联文化艺术科学工作者代表团来到了。万余青年男女在李富春、林枫率领下赴站欢迎。当火车到站时，马、恩、列、斯巨像和红旗迎风招展，军乐队演奏国际歌，活泼的儿童蜂拥献花。走出车站后，苏联的代表们谢绝乘车，在夹道欢呼中前进。“欢迎苏联代表团”、“斯大林万岁”的口号，伴随着友人的步伐起伏着。以法捷耶夫为首的苏联代表团的队伍，持着花，不停地挥动着帽子，来回答欢迎的人群。在热烈的欢迎会上，西蒙诺夫——这位年青的苏联人民卓越的文学家，向中国人民热情的讲话了，他说：“我们很高兴在沈阳向你们致敬礼。沈阳这个城是有反抗日本侵略者和美帝国主义者的传统的”。沈阳人民感到骄傲与无尚的光荣。
    　　　　（二）提灯大游行
    一九四九年十月一日，在这个永远不会忘记的节日里，沈阳整个被装扮起来了，人人穿着新衣，急驰的汽车、电车和马车都配了彩装，宣传卡车，秧歌队，往来如织。入夜，户户挂起红灯，大队的灯火游行开始了。市府广场上川流不息，太原街拥挤得水泄不通，南站广场表演者一起接着一起，站前的房顶上按装着红绿交叉的霓虹灯火车头，头上的五角星忽暗忽明，两旁树立着一丈六七尺高两幅工农兵油画巨像，写着“消灭国民党一切残余匪帮”和中俄合写的“保卫世界永久和平”。彩装电车犹如一条火龙。看！中国医科大学漫长的队伍手擎着中国地图形红灯，唱着雄壮的歌声，看！南站工务段的工友们手里挥动着镰刀灯和斧头灯，看！沈市荣军学校的同学们紧张兴奋的神情和高亢的歌声，这里有秀水河子战斗中打断一条腿的王喜发，这里有锦州、天津、徐州等地战斗中的许多人民功臣。
    黑暗被驱逐了，到处是各色的灯——五星灯、莲花灯、飞机灯、坦克灯、红人灯……，灯光照耀着笑脸盈盈的人群，人民喜悦，人民庆祝，因为，中国人民从此站立起来了！
    　　　　（三）不可抗拒的力量
    经过了一夜的狂欢，十月二日，全市举行了空前的五十万人盛大集会和检阅式的游行。
    以中山广场为核心辐射的三条长街，游行的队伍直排了六七里长。当十点十五分检阅式开始时，雄壮的队伍一队队从主席台通过。六架人民飞机盘旋高空。
    东北人民解放军的健儿们，整洁的服装，合拍的步伐，闪亮的武器，笔挺的胸膛，严肃的阵容，表现出人民解放军不可战胜的坚强意志。
    当工人的队伍，出现在人们的面前时，煤矿工人化装着下井的姿势。铁路工人推着历史车轮。车轮厂抬着历次所得的奖旗—！华东号、北平号、南京号。农具工厂推着彩装的收获机、拖拉机。这些创造一切的劳动者，是新中国建设的主力军。
    在学生队伍中，沈阳工学院举着的大地球仪上，苏联首都莫斯科标写着“和平堡垒”，新中国首都北京市插着五星红旗。挽臂前进的工人政治大学，最前排的胸前都挂着上写“保卫世界和平”的红星。南昌小学用队伍排拼“儿童们站立起来创造我们的新生”的字样。
    市民的队伍也是有组织的整齐的行进着。人们挥着帽子，摇着旗，欢呼雷鸣。万全街的家庭妇女秧歌队，尽情的扭着，特别引人注目的是朝鲜居民的队伍，穿着朝鲜服，扭着朝鲜秧歌舞，男的打手鼓，女的舞蹈，大队喊着“中鲜人民团结起来保卫世界和平”。日本侨民擎着斯大林、毛泽东、德田球一的巨像，高呼：“中华人民共和国万岁！”“拥护世界被压迫民族解放运动！”
    队伍由三路变成六路、九路，汹涌前进，狂欢沸腾了全城。这是不可抗拒的力量，让帝国主义者及其走狗们惊恐吧。
    　　　　（四）加紧生产、学习，迎接新中国
    当人民政协在北京开幕的时候，沈市的工厂、机关和学校就决定以加紧生产、加紧学习来迎接新中国的成立。沈阳毛织工厂女工张淑琴、喜春魁说：“我们要搞好生产，来表示内心的喜悦，庆祝新中国的成立。”这话代表着全体工人的意志。各工厂立即展开了献工热潮。沈阳第一机器厂除保证完成九月份工作任务外并作了集体与个人的计划。第三机器厂第二工作部全体车工献出一小时外，为迎接十月二日国际和平斗争日准备工作是十分紧张的，橡胶厂工友自动献工两夜完成了直径六米的大氢气球。新新一厂赶作好一百五十个大爆竹，又另作三百个，送到北京做献礼。一座五丈高的主席台，是东大建筑公司一百九十个工友十三个职员，三昼夜突击完成的。军需三局三个被服厂千余职工献工完成六千面国旗。清道夫昼夜不停保持街道清洁。军需三分厂七千余职工的贺信里说：“为了办好工厂，各厂都展开了合理化建议，使工厂有了不少改进，工人阶级掌握了国家大权，我们将勇敢的担当起这个任务努力发展生产，建设人民的新沈阳。”
    二十六日宣传周开始的时候，沈阳市职工会与市青年团部号召全市七万工会会员，七千青年团员，七万大、中、小学生，认真学习毛主席开幕词及社论。东北日报自己召开妇女、青年、工人的座谈会，各机关都开了干部及全体工作员会议。东北职工会与青年团并派人到各学校讲课，各种训练班，大、中学校及工人夜校均以政协为政治课内容，到处上大课，作报告，展开了热烈的学习。
    中国革命的胜利鼓舞着日本人民的斗志。沈阳日侨怀着喜悦的心情，把消息传给自己的亲戚朋友和一切熟习的人。中国医大松原教授说：“日本人民应当学习这点，不巩固人民革命阵营，就不会战胜反动势力，使日本人民脱离苦难的深渊。”医大附属医院松枝说：“不久的将来，在日本也会有这一天。”
