　　(I) Advocating New Democratic National Sports
    The Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference includes the cultural and educational policy, Article 48 stipulates "advocating national sports". This is an indispensable and important provision for the development of our people's production and the construction of national defense. The construction of the People's Republic in all aspects is beginning, our task is great and arduous, we must actively promote national sports, so that our people have healthy bodies and strong physical strength to participate in the country's construction.
    In the years of the Kuomintang reactionary rule, the sports of the people were subjected to various kinds of destruction. The Kuomintang government was fundamentally indifferent to the health of the vast majority of the people. The situation has completely changed now, the people's own country and government have given us all the convenient conditions to widely develop national sports.
    The national sports we advocate are new democratic national sports, which are broad mass sports. The content and form of this kind of sports should enable the majority of people to accept, welcome, participate in and enjoy it. The athletes of this kind of sports activities are cultivated on the basis of popularizing national sports, and such athletes will inevitably engage in productive labor, study and work with their healthy bodies, and become models for the masses. That is to say, the sports we advocate are national, scientific, and mass sports, that is, new democratic sports.
    In order to develop new democratic sports and popularize sports to all the people, the subjects and forms of sports must be appropriately improved. This requires us to collect and study the existing experience of the sports circles in the past, whether from schools, the army, or individual experts, whether from the folk, domestic or foreign, to form a complete and brand-new national sports. For example, various obstacle-crossing exercises in the armed forces of the People's Liberation Army are worthy of great promotion; there are also many mass dances and acrobatics in the folk that can be improved and promoted; the Soviet Union's "Sports Parade" has given us many valuable learning materials. In this way, plus some scientific, reasonable, and can be retained and promoted parts of the original sports, a brand-new and complete set of methods may appear in the near future.
    In order to achieve this grand goal, we must rely on the unity of the sports circles. All those who have experience, knowledge, contribution, and interest in sports should unite under the general goal of developing new democratic national sports, work together, constantly learn, learn again, and constantly improve, and improve again.
    The Beijing Sports Conference, which opened today, is a sports conference under the guidance of the principles of new democratic national sports. We wish the conference success, and hope that this will be a guide to develop across the country, so that hundreds of millions of people in our People's Republic of China can join the ranks of building a new China with healthy bodies, and join the ranks of fighting for world peace and democracy.

　　（一）提倡新民主主义的国民体育
    中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领中的文化教育政策部分，第四十八条规定要“提倡国民体育”，这对发展我国人民的生产、建设人民的国防，都是不可缺少的一项重要规定。人民共和国各方面的建设工作正在开始，我们的任务是伟大而艰巨的，我们就必须积极提倡国民体育，使我们的国民，有健康的体格和强壮的体力来参加国家的建设事业。
    在国民党反动统治的年代里，人民大众的体育是遭受着种种摧残的，国民党政府对于最大多数人民的健康是根本漠不关心的。现在的情形已经完全改变了，人民自己的国家和政府给了我们一切便利的条件，可以广泛发展国民体育。
    我们所提倡的国民体育是新民主主义的国民体育，是广大群众性的体育。这种体育的内容与形式，要使大多数人都能接受，都能欢迎，都能参加和享受。这种体育活动的选手是在普及国民体育的基础上培养出来的，而这样的选手也必然会以自己健壮的体格去从事生产劳动、学习和工作，成为群众的模范。这就是说，我们所提倡的体育是民族的、科学的、大众的体育，就是新民主主义的体育。
    为了发展新民主主义的体育，把体育普及到全体国民中去，体育的科目与形式必须有适当的改进。这就要求我们把过去体育界已有的经验，无论是学校的、军队的或个别专门家的，也无论是民间的、本国的以及外国的，普遍加以汇集研究，形成完整的崭新的国民体育。比如人民解放军武装部队中各种各样超越障碍的演习，即值得大大推广；民间的群众性舞蹈与杂耍中，也有不少是可以提高与推广的；苏联的“体育大观”，更给了我们许多宝贵的学习材料。这样，再加上原有体育中若干科学的、合理的、可以保留推广的部分，崭新完整的一套办法就有可能在不远的将来出现。
    为了达到这一远大目标，就必须依靠体育界的一致团结。凡在体育方面有经验、有学识、有贡献、有兴趣的人，都应该在开展新民主主义的国民体育这一总目标下团结起来，共同努力，不断地学习，再学习，不断地改进，再改进。
    今天开幕的北京市体育大会，即是在新民主主义的国民体育的原则指导下的一个体育大会。我们谨祝大会的成功，并希望以此为先导，向全国开展，使我们中华人民共和国的数亿国民都能以健壮的体格加入建设新中国的行列，加入为全世界和平民主而斗争的行列。
