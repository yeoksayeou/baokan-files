The Beijing Labor Production Brigade
Jun Qian

On August 30th and September 2nd, I visited the Beijing Labor Production Brigade on the banks of the Yellow River in Dong'a, which was engaged in labor training to seek ideological transformation.

This group was organized from scattered soldiers, vagrants, and petty thieves from Beijing. When they arrived on the banks of the Yellow River from Tong County and started carrying earth, each person had a cotton pad on their shoulder, their arms were bruised, and their hands were blistered. The wage for each cubic meter of earth was two pounds of rice and two pounds of firewood. At first, due to unfamiliarity with labor, each person could only do a little over one cubic meter of earth per day, and some could only do a fraction of a cubic meter. The wages earned were not enough to cover expenses, and morale was low, with even cases of desertion. After a period of arduous education and labor training, most can now carry more than three cubic meters of earth, and many can carry more than four. They no longer need the cotton pad to protect their shoulders when carrying, and they no longer feel pain!

I followed them to Mazhuang and saw that their living arrangements were well-equipped. The clinic had dozens of kinds of medicines, which were sufficient for general illnesses. The doctor was a team member named Pan Chengrong who had previously worked in medical services. Pan initially performed very poorly, but after repeated education and criticism from the masses, he was determined to reform himself and had already made a plan to perform meritorious service. I saw him patiently diagnosing and treating sores for the team members. The cost of medicines was initially bought from their surplus funds. From August, the public provided them with a monthly medical expense of one and a half pounds of rice per person. In another room, four team members who had previously worked as tailors were busy making clothes. According to the squadron leader Li Chenghua and political instructor Peng Huamin: Most of the team members were barely clothed when they first arrived, but now they have new shirts and underwear, and are now making their second set of long trousers and jackets. Under the principle of self-reliance and more work for more pay, their lives are gradually improving due to their increased work efficiency.

Squadron leader Comrade Li is a twenty-four-year-old youth who joined the revolution at the age of twelve. He was gloriously wounded seven times for the liberation of the people. Last year, he was the machine gun company commander in the Zihongkou battle in Laiyuan. After being wounded in the Zihongkou battle, he had not fully recovered his health, but he took on the arduous task of transforming the old people. Instructor Peng is a loyal middle-aged man who was also wounded four times for the people's liberation cause. There is still a piece of shrapnel in his waist that has not been removed. Although these veteran soldiers have suffered serious injuries, they share the joys and sorrows of the team members and participate in the earth-carrying work to influence and transform this group of scattered soldiers, vagrants, and petty thieves. Now, the vast majority of team members can work with peace of mind, hoping to be assigned work and participate in the construction of the new China after labor training. Since the end of August, the squadron has begun to recommend team members who have been elected as models for jobs (two have already been recommended to work at the No. 4 Repair and Prevention Office Shipyard), which has further encouraged the team members to actively reform themselves.

The First Squadron only had a squadron leader in September. Although only Instructor Li Zhenhuan (who had served as a reconnaissance and communications platoon leader in the People's Liberation Army) was responsible for the past three months, and although his wounded (wounded four times in total) right arm had not yet healed and was still bandaged during the Jinzhong Campaign last year, he achieved great results through his arduous efforts. The squadron has seventy-nine team members, excluding six who deserted and those who were sent home due to special illnesses. The vast majority are scattered soldiers from the Kuomintang army. As a result of the team members' active labor, the squadron has the best living conditions among the four squadrons. The team members not only eat three meals of white flour every day, but also eat pork two or three times a month! Instructor Li said: "The living conditions of our team members have exceeded the level of ordinary people and ordinary organs!" In particular, the team members are wearing neat gray new uniforms, which look very much like a regular troop!

The scattered soldiers, vagrants, and petty thieves of Beijing, such a mixed group, have greatly improved their lives after only three months of the Communist Party's painstaking transformation. The parasitic thoughts left to them by the old society have also been initially transformed, making them know how to seek light, be self-reliant, and be willing to serve the people, and ask to participate in the construction of the new China. The Communist Party saved them, and they gained a new life. Therefore, they sang sincerely.

Team members Dong Huanran, Sun Lizhi, Guo Zhongsen, and others from the First Squadron composed the following song using the "Sun Red" tune:

　　The Yellow River water is truly fierce,
　　It floods the people year after year.
　　To eliminate disasters for the people,
　　Hu—cough ya,
　　We will perform meritorious service before the people.

　　×　　×　　×

　　Building the dam is truly glorious,
　　We learn to work.
　　The People's Government leads us,
　　Hu—cough ya,
　　Everyone works hard to complete it.

　　×　　×　　×

　　Repairing the river embankment is for flood control,
　　Labor production is truly glorious.
　　Strive to be the first and work harder,
　　Hu—cough ya,
　　Strive to be a model and become a hero.

　　北京劳动生产大队
    君谦
    八月三十日和九月二日，我在东阿的黄河岸上，访问了从事劳动锻炼，以求得思想改造的北京劳动生产大队。
    这批队伍，就是北京的流散军人、游民、小偷所组织起来的，他们从通县开到黄河岸上，开始抬土时，每个人的肩上，虽然衬着个棉垫子，膀子也都被压肿了，手也磨出泡来了。每方土的工资是二斤米和二斤柴，开始时，由于不惯劳动，每人每天只能做一方多土，还有做几分土的，所得工资不够开支，情绪不好，甚至发生逃亡。经过一段艰苦教育，和劳动锻炼，现在大多能抬到三方多土，还有不少抬到四方多的，抬时不用那块棉垫子护膀子，也不感觉痛苦了！
    我随他们到了马庄，见他们的家务，已设备得很好，几十种药品的卫生所，一般病症满可以够用。医生是个曾经做过医务工作的队员潘成荣，潘开始时表现很不好，经过群众多次的教育、批评，已下决心改正，并已做了立功计划。我看见他很耐心地为队员们诊病治疮。药品费起初是由他们的节余项下买的，自八月份起，公家发给他们每人每月一斤半米的医药费。在另一座屋里，有四名曾经做过裁缝的队员，正忙着做衣服，据该中队队长李成华和政指彭华民说：队员在初来到时，大多衣不遮体，现在已经穿上了新衬衣，新裤衩，现在又进行做第二身长裤褂。在自食其力，多做多得的原则下，由于他们工作效率的提高，他们的生活，是逐渐在改善。
    中队队长李同志是位二十四岁的青年，十二岁参加革命，他为解放人民，曾七次光荣负伤，去年涞源子洪口战役时任机炮连长，子洪口战役负伤后，健康尚未完全恢复，就又担负了这个改造旧人的艰巨任务。彭指导员是个为人忠实的中年人，也为人民解放事业负伤四次，现在他的腰里，尚有一块炮弹皮没有取出。这些荣军同志，虽然身体都已受了严重的伤损，为了感化改造这批流散军人、游民、小偷，就和队员们共甘苦，同样参加抬土工作。现在队员的绝大多数已能安心劳动，希望经过劳动锻炼后，听候分配工作，参加新中国的建设事业。自八月底起，该中队已开始为民选为模范的队员介绍工作（已有二名被介绍到第四修防处船厂去工作），这就更鼓起了队员们积极改造自己的情绪。
    第一中队，九月份才有了中队长，过去三个月虽然只指导员李振环同志负责（当过人民解放军的侦通连连长），虽然在去年晋中战役时，他那负伤（共负伤四次）的右臂还没有痊愈，还缠着绷带，然而在他的艰苦努力下，却得到了很大的成绩，该中队除去六名逃亡和因特殊疾病介绍回家的外，现尚有队员七十九名，绝大部分是国民党军队的流散军人。由于队员积极劳动的结果，该中队在四个中队中的生活最好，队员不但每天吃三顿白面，每月还吃两三次猪肉！李指导员说：“我们队员的生活，已超过一般群众和一般机关的水平”；尤其队员们穿着整齐的灰色新制服，很象一批正规队伍了！
    北京的流散军人、游民、小偷，这么一批杂乱的队伍，经过共产党的苦心改造，虽然还只是三个月的短时间，已使他们的生活大大改善了。旧社会所遗留给他们的寄生思想也得到了初步改造，使他们知道求光明，自食其力，并愿为人民服务，要求参加新中国的建设事业。共产党挽救了他们，他们获得了新生。因此他们就发出了衷心的歌唱。
    第一中队队员董焕然、孙立志、郭忠森等，用“太阳红”调，作了如下的歌：
    黄河水，真是凶，
    年年要把百姓倾。
    为了人民除祸害，
    呼—咳呀，
    人民面前去立功。
     ×　　×　　×
    筑河坝，真光荣，
    我们学习来劳动。
    人民政府来领导，
    呼—咳呀，
    大家努力去完成。
     ×　　×　　×
    修河堤，为防洪，
    劳动生产真光荣。
    争先恐后加油干，
    呼—咳呀，
    争取模范当英雄。
