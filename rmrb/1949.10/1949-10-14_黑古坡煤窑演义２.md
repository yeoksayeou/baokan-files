　　The Black Ancient Slope Coal Mine Chronicle 2
    Kang Tuo
    Da San treated his fellow craftsmen and workers the same way. When he met someone with better skills than him, he never asked about their position, nor did he care if they paid him any attention. He would run up, pat them on the shoulder, and say, "Buddy! You're good! Please give me some guidance!" If people treated him sincerely, he would definitely acknowledge them as his teacher and learn from them. But if they treated him insincerely, were sweet-talking but malicious, or simply ignored him, he would still submit obediently, swallowing his grievances. However, if he encountered a craftsman who wasn't as good as him, or a worker who was lazy and tried to get away with things, he wouldn't care about your tricks or intentions. If your work wasn't right, he would change his expression and start scolding. If anyone refused to accept it, he would drag them to see the foreman, saying, "Foreman! I can't work with this guy!" If the foreman refused to transfer that person away, he would rather pack his bags and leave than continue to work carelessly.

    Da San was just so straightforward, he didn't know how many people he had offended, how many quarrels he had caused, working here for three days, mixing there for two months, never staying in one place for long. But precisely because of his temperament, he also made many loyal friends. Friends helped each other, cared for each other in the coal pit, and looked after each other in terms of skills. Whenever someone suffered a disaster, everyone would help as long as they had money or rice at home. If they couldn't manage it themselves, they would find someone to ask for help and try everything possible. When work was suspended, they would spend money to buy wine with their friends, get a woman, and chat for a while. When the money was spent, they would endure a few days in the coal pit. Just like that, briskly and happily, Da San, with all his skills, ended up with nothing, having no food to eat if he didn't work for a day. He was almost fifty years old, but he hadn't even married a wife, still a bachelor.

    　　　　II Returning to the Village
    Da San left home at the age of eighteen, drifting around. It had been almost twenty years since he had returned to Black Stone Slope Village.

    One year, he was at the West Mountain Mine in Taiyuan Prefecture, leading some people to dig a new branch off the coal wall of the pit. He was in charge of leading the branch. Because the workers were all to his liking, he worked very hard. At this time, an engineer came to the mine. That person was impressed by his skills and promoted him to be in charge of a pit as a supervisor. That person sometimes listened to a few of his words, and he also felt that the person really had some ability, so he worked even harder. He worked for two years, which was the first time he had worked in one place for so many days in a row. Unexpectedly, one day, the engineer was suddenly leaving! When he left, the engineer shook his head and said to him, "This mining industry is impossible to do!" He didn't quite understand what this sentence meant, but he seemed a little unwilling to let the person leave, but there was nothing he could do. After that, his enthusiasm cooled down a lot. Who knew that the next person to come was a Japanese. It's not to say whether this person had any ability, but he was fierce to the workers. He also demoted Da San to a branch leader and replaced him with a supervisor who was just as fierce as the Japanese. That fellow even bragged to people every day that he had some kind of relative relationship with Military Governor Yan. Because Da San didn't give a gift to this newly appointed person, he was always picking on Da San. Later, he demoted Da San to a digger. Da San couldn't bear it and made a fuss twice. Before long, they fired him. This time, Da San didn't just pack his bags and leave. He couldn't say what kind of feeling it was, but he was reluctant to leave that pit where he had been a supervisor for two years. He, his workers, and the former engineer had worked together to make that pit so good, producing so much coal! However, there was nothing he could do. He had to find a friend to introduce him to a small kiln of a local landlord in the countryside to be a supervisor, thinking that it was not far from West Mountain in the prefecture, and it would be good to hear about the situation of his kiln in the future. Who knew that all these years he had been working on the business of large machine kilns, and he was inevitably a little clumsy with the earth kilns. In addition, he was in a bad mood, and he carelessly dug out a small stream of water at the bottom of the kiln. This was not a big deal. He could quickly find a way to block the water outlet and drain the water that flowed out. Unexpectedly, that landlord was narrow-minded and afraid of the unknown, repeatedly asked if he could block the outlet tomorrow, and urged him to block it by midnight tonight, shouting loudly, which aroused Da San's fiery temper. He endured a breath, fixed the problem, and left the kiln silently, without settling the accounts.

    He went to West Mountain in the prefecture again. There, he heard that more of his old workers had been fired or scattered. He couldn't find work either. Thinking silently, his mind felt a burst of cold. He had no choice but to go to Shouyang to find a friend. He didn't find his friend in Shouyang, but he met a distant brother who was about to return to his village to roll a kiln, and he forcibly pulled him back. He thought that he had been away for many years, ending up with nothing, and he couldn't help but feel a little sad. But he didn't have a readily available path at the moment, and his brother kept pestering him, so he reluctantly returned to Black Stone Slope.

    It turned out that his brother's name was Zhang Xilu. This person had only ten or so acres of land in his early years, which he cultivated himself. He also set up a small stall in the village to sell groceries. But this person was quite capable, especially learning a good abacus skill. He could clearly calculate while looking at the accounts and dialing the abacus, without looking at the abacus. Sometimes, without an abacus, he could clearly calculate while looking at the accounts and virtually dialing the abacus beads on the table or his leg. Speaking of his character, although he had no marriage connection with officials and rich people and could not rely on them, he never妄想要 wanted to rely on them. But he could win over and be close to the figures in the business market, and he also tried to win over and be close to people. In addition, he was peaceful and enthusiastic with those who cultivated the land, went down to the kiln, and ran around selling their strength to make a living. If they met right, he would be willing to take care of them. Therefore, ordinary people said that he had a good personality and were willing to approach him and help him. In this way, he quickly saved some money. Then, he gave the land to his sons to cultivate and went to Yangquan to open a small shop himself. Over the years, he also learned to partner with people to do some "flash trade", seizing any good market opportunity to make some money. Then, he slowly bought more than ten acres of land, and his family also hired a half-time farmhand. He also invested some shares in a friend's small shop in Shouyang City. Recently, he didn't know how he earned some money again. He was very happy. Coupled with other people's persuasion, and also because the suffering people in Black Stone Slope were lacking kilns to work in, he actually learned to be like the local rich people and decided to return to the village to open a coal kiln. So he asked someone to look at the land vein and bought a mining area at the foot of the slope in his village, intending to find his distant grandson Zhang Yubao to be the supervisor. He was planning to do this when he went to the small shop in Shouyang to take back his shares for use. Unexpectedly, he met Da San. He knew that Da San was ten times better than Yubao, so he forcibly pulled him back.

    Da San had been away from the village for so many years, and the village hadn't changed much, but he himself had changed a lot. He wore fine cloth jackets and trousers, wore an old felt hat, had a gold tooth inlaid in his mouth, and washed his hands and face clean every day. He just nodded slightly when he saw people, without smiling, which was considered a greeting. He didn't talk much. People gathered together to talk nonsense, but he just listened on the sidelines. If anyone asked him anything, he wouldn't call himself "I, Da San" or "I, Third Little" like he used to, but changed to an official name that no one could remember, saying, "I, Zhang Yuanlu," blah blah blah, dryly in two or three sentences, without beating around the bush or rambling. His two broken houses had been lived in by his uncle's second son for many years. Now he had vacated one room for him, and he also cleaned it up spotlessly. There were decorations, bedding, and several photos of him and his friends on the small table. No one in the village had a room as beautiful as his when they married a wife. He also ate thick porridge and soup, and he always had to eat white flour. The jade grain noodle porridge and millet soup that almost every family in the village ate every day, he didn't eat much. People felt that he was different from everyone, so they couldn't help but go to his house to see something rare, ask about the length, and gossip about him, guessing that he hadn't even married a wife. He didn't seem to have made a fortune, but he didn't seem to be poor either. What kind of person was he? People compared him from left to right and described him. Later, a young man named Shuan Cheng, who had some knowledge and was very clever, thought of something one time and said to the people, "Da San is like a ticket inspector on a train!" People felt that this was about right, so they asked him again, "What kind of person's house do you think his room is like?" He thought for a while and said, "This is hard to compare. It's like the stationmaster's room at the station, but it's not that strong." At this time, a widow who liked to gossip with men, whose mother's family was from Willow Ditch, was sold to Zhang Jubao, a big landlord in this village, to be a maid when she was young. Later, the landlord married her out, and people still followed the past landlord's name, calling her Willow Ditch's family. Her eyes rolled around and she interjected, "What you said is not right. Who doesn't have a wife for the stationmaster or something at the station? Does he have one?" A fellow sitting next to her, nicknamed Little Foreign Devil, blinked his eyelids twice in a row and said to her with his mouth turned up, "Aren't you also lacking one? I think if you find someone to talk to you, you'll be sure to be Mrs. Da San, the stationmaster!" People laughed, and Willow Ditch's family quickly cursed while raising her pipe to knock on Little Foreign Devil's head. Little Foreign Devil shrank his neck, stuck out his tongue, rolled on the ground, and ran away. Unexpectedly, Da San was coming at this time, and people held back their laughter. Little Foreign Devil, relying on his age, told Da San about their gossip in its original form, wanting to please Da San. But Da San shook his head and said, "Don't compare me to those people! I don't dare to associate with those people! What am I? Anyway, I'm just a kiln black!" People laughed again for a while before leaving separately.

　　黑古坡煤窑演义２
    康濯
    对待同行把式和伙计，大三也是这样。碰见本领比他高的，他从不问人家职位高低，也不管人家搭理不搭理，就跑上去，拍着人家肩膀说：“伙计！有你的！多关照多指教！”人家实心待他，他一定拜人为师跟人学；人家若待他虚情假意，嘴甜心辣，或是干脆不搭理他，他隙也肯服服贴贴，吃了亏往肚里咽。可是，要碰见不如他的把式，或是偷懒卖乖的伙计，他又不管你什么门道什么心眼，反正你营生不对劲，他就变脸张嘴骂人，谁不服，就扭谁去见掌柜，一句话：“掌柜的！咱俩搭不成伙计！”掌柜的若不肯把那人调走，他宁愿自己卷铺盖，决不肯马马虎虎干下去。
    大三就是这样直出直入，真不知得罪了多少人，吵闹过多少蹩扭，这里干三天，那里混两月，从没个固定地势。可也正因为他这个脾气，他也交结下不少患难朋友，朋友间彼此帮助，窑坑里关心，把式上照顾，谁个遭灾遇难，人人只要手头有钱家中有米，一定接济，自己没法，也要寻人托门子想方设法：歇工的时候，他们朋友一道，大伙花钱买酒，交个把女人，捣拉一阵闲话；钱花完了，窑底下闷几天再说。就这么利利索索痛痛快快，大三这人一身本领，到头来只落得两手空空，一天不干就没饭吃；年岁快五十，却连个老婆也没娶，还是一条光棍。
    　　　　二　回村
    大三是十八岁上出门，飘流在外，差不多整二十年没回过黑石坡村。
    有一年，他在太原府西山矿上，领着一些人，从窑坑的煤墙上，刨开一道新岔，他当领岔的；因为伙计们都对他的脾味，他干得很上劲。这时矿上来了个工程师，那人看中了他的把式，就提升他当总管一个窑坑的领事。那人有时也听信他几句话，他也觉着那人果真有点本事，因此干得更有劲，一干干了二年，这是他在一个地方连着干那么些日子的头一回。不想有一天，猛不防地那工程师却要走了！走时，工程师摇着脑袋对他说：“这工矿没法干！”他不大懂这句话的意思，只是好象有些不愿让人家走，可也没办法，此后他的干劲就冷多了。谁知接着来的是个日本人，这人有没有本领倒不说，光是待伙计们就凶虎虎地，还把大三降成个领岔的，换了个领事也跟日本人一球样凶，那家伙还天天跟人吹说他跟阎督军有什么瓜葛亲戚，因为大三没给他这个新上任的送礼，他就成天跟大三碰，后来又把大三降成了个刨头，大三别不住，闹了两回，不久人家就把他开除了。这一回，大三可没有铺盖一卷就走：他说不出是股什么劲，总舍不得他当过二年领事的那个窑坑，他们伙计们和过去那个工程师一道，把那坑打整得多好，出炭正多哩！可是，没办法，他只得找了个朋友，介绍到左近乡下一个土财主的小窑里去当领事，心想离府西山不远，往后能听听他那窑坑是怎么个情由，也是好的。谁知他这些年尽干的是机器大窑营生，对土窑不免有点生手生脚，再加他心情不好，不提防在窑底刨出一小股活水来；这本不算回事，他能很快想法把水口堵死，把流下的水打尽的；不想那个土财主心眼窄，又是头一回滚窑，怕的不行，一会来问问是不是明个堵得住口，一会又来催催今黑家半夜里能堵死不能，还口口声声嚷闹，惹出了大三的火性，他使劲忍住一口气，把营生打整好，就一声不响，帐也没算，一个光人离了窑。
    他又去了府西山。在那里，却听说他的老伙计们被开除的、走散的更多了，他也不好找营生，低头想想，心眼不觉一阵阵发冷，只得到寿阳找一个朋友去。寿阳朋友没找着，却碰见他一个远房哥哥正要回本村滚窑，硬拉他回去，他想想在外多年，落得个甚也不是，不免有些伤心；可一时也没现成路，他哥又死缠住他不放，他这才勉强回了黑石坡。
    却说他这个哥哥名叫张喜禄。这人早些年也不过有十来亩地，自己养种着，捎带还在村里摆了个小摊，卖点杂货。但他这人还算能干，特别是学得一手好算盘，平日一边看帐一边拨算盘子，眼不望算盘，可以打个清清楚楚；有时没算盘，他就一边看帐，一边用手指头在桌上或腿上虚拨着算盘珠，也能算个明明白白。说起他的为人，虽说跟官家财主们没姻缘、靠不上，也从没妄想要靠上去过，但同买卖场中的人物却能拉拢亲近，并且他也一个劲想法拉拢亲近人家；此外，跟那些养种地的、下窑的、跑跑跳跳卖力气混饭吃的受苦人，他也平平和和热热火火，碰对了还肯关照人家，因此平常人都说他人性好，乐意接近他，给他帮忙出力。就这样，他很快便攒了点钱，于是把地搭给家里儿子们养种，自己去阳泉开了个小铺。这些年来，他又学着跟人搭伙干两下“闪商”，猛不防抓住什么行市作一回生意，捞两个子；于是他慢慢又置了十来亩地，家里也雇了半块长工，并且还在寿阳城一个朋友的小铺里入了点股子。最近不知他又怎么挣了俩钱，自己一阵高兴，加上别人的说合，再说黑石坡的受苦人也正缺窑动弹，他就居然也学着本地一般财主的模样，决定回村开煤窑了。于是他找人看了地脉，就在本村坡根买了个矿区，打算找他一个远房孙儿张玉宝当领事，正在筹划的时候，他来寿阳小铺把他那点股子取回去用；不想碰见了大三，他明知大三比玉宝强比十倍，就硬拉他回来了。
    大三离村这么些年，村里倒没什么变，他自己却大变了：他穿的细布袄裤，戴的旧呢礼帽，嘴里镶了颗金牙，手脸也是成天洗得干干净净地，见了人只略一点头，笑也不笑，就算打了招呼；说话不多，人们一圪堆胡说瞎嚷，他只在旁边听，谁要问他个什么，他也不象当年那样自称“我大三”“我三小”的，却换成谁也记不得的官名道：“我张远禄”怎么怎么，干巴巴三两句，不拐弯抹角乱噜嗦。他那两间破房，是他大爷的二小打整着住了多年，这会给他腾出了一间，他也拾掇得干干净净：有摆设，有铺盖，小桌上还搁了几张他和朋友们的像片，村里谁家娶媳妇也没他这房漂亮。他吃饭也是稠的浆的多，短不了要吃个白面的，村里差不多每家每天都要吃的玉菱面稀沙和小米米汤，他却不大吃。人们觉着他跟大伙不一样，就短不了上他家去看个稀罕，问个长短，背后捣拉他估量他，猜想他连个媳妇也没娶，不象是发了财，可又不象穷人，到底是哪一路人物呢？人们左比方右描画，后来有个名叫拴成的青年，还有点见识，心眼本又灵巧，他有一回想起对人们说：“大三象个火车上查票的！”人们觉着这还差不多，就又问他道：“你看他那房象哪一号人住的？”他想了想说：“这可难比方，象车站上站长的房，可又没那强。”这时有个爱跟男人们闲捣拉的寡妇，妈家是柳沟的，从小卖给这村大财主张聚宝家当丫头使女，后来财主把她嫁出来，人们还尽跟着过去财主家的称呼，叫她柳沟家；他眼珠子一溜转就插嘴道：“这说的都不象，人家车站上站长什么的谁没媳妇？他可有？”一个坐在她旁边，外号叫小洋鬼的家伙，眼皮连着扑展了两下，翘着嘴对她说：“你不是也正缺一个？我看寻个人说说，你当个大三站长太太的准行！”人们都笑了，柳沟家忙一边骂着，一边伸出旱烟袋就往小洋鬼脑袋上敲去，小洋鬼脖子一缩舌头一伸，就地一滚往开跑，不想这时大三正走了来，人们才忍住笑：小洋鬼又倚老卖老，噜噜嗦嗦把他们捣拉的原样告给了大三，想讨大三个欢喜，大三却摇着脑袋说：“比那些干球！那些人咱可不敢高攀！咱算个什么？反正是个窑黑！”人们又笑了一阵，才各自走开去。
