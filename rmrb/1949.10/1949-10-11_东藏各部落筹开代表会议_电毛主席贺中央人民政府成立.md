　　Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, October 10th: Late news from Xiahe: Various tribes in Eastern Tibet (including Qinghai, Xikang, southwestern Gansu, the Qilian Mountains area of the Hexi Corridor, and northwestern Sichuan) convened a preparatory meeting for a representative conference of various tribes in Xiahe (i.e., Labrang) in Gansu in early September. Attendees included Huang Xiang (Tibetan), Huang Zhengqing (Tibetan), Wu Zhengang (Tibetan), Huang Wenyuan (Mongolian), Bandida (Tibetan), Ya Hanzhang (representative of Linxia sub-district), Huo Deyi (representative of the Chinese Communist Party of Xiahe), and others. The preparatory committee secretariat has been established, and dozens of Tibetan youths have joined the work. A song and dance troupe of twenty people has compiled the song "Nan Ta Saiwa," which expresses gratitude to the Communist Party for helping the Tibetan and Mongolian people liberate themselves, and includes lyrics such as "A good sun rises in the blue sky, and the sun is the Communist Party." A lecture group uses both Han and Tibetan languages on the streets to explain national equality, freedom of religious belief, and the significance of convening a representative conference of various tribes. The propaganda group publishes the "Voice of Tibetans" bulletin in both Han and Tibetan languages. Han Chinese merchants in Xiahe Street, hearing the news that the conference will be held soon, are also selecting representatives to participate and are spontaneously organizing Yangko dance teams to carry out propaganda activities. The entire Xiahe is filled with an atmosphere of unity and harmony among people of all ethnic groups. Currently, representatives have arrived from more than thirty units, including the Yaoer tribe of Tongde County in Qinghai, twenty-one tribes such as Rang'ao and Te'ao of Tongren County, representatives of the Heshuote Banner of the Mongolian ethnic group in Qinghai, the Maixi tribe of Lintan in Gansu, and representatives of lamas from Songpan in Sichuan, totaling 192 representatives, with more than 100 representatives still on their way.
    Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, October 10th: Xiahe News: Representatives of various tribes in Eastern Tibet sent a telegram to Chairman Mao to celebrate the founding of the Central People's Government.
