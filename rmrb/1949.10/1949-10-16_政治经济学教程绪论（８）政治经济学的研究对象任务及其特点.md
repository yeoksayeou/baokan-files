　　Introduction to Political Economy Tutorial (8)
  　The Object and Tasks of Political Economy Research and Its Characteristics
    Chapter One: Mode of Production
    Section One: Production
    It can improve productivity. In capitalist society, it is originally one of the methods commonly used by capitalists to strengthen the exploitation of the working class's surplus value. Capitalists often increase the speed of machines and expand the scope of machines monitored by the same laborer, that is, expand the labor scope of the same laborer. At the same time, they use special wage systems to stimulate and lure workers to continuously strengthen their labor intensity to improve labor productivity, so as to strengthen the exploitation of workers. However, excessive labor intensity is harmful to the health and life of workers, and will increase danger. Excessive labor intensity, or excessive tension of labor, will quickly cause workers to lose their ability to work, age quickly, easily lead to various diseases, and easily cause various disasters in enterprises, causing workers to suffer injuries. However, on the basis of the working class's consciousness, and with appropriate reforms of labor conditions, appropriately increasing labor intensity can still improve and develop labor productivity, and is also harmless to the working class. For example, in socialist and new democratic enterprises, the reasonable increase in labor intensity in labor competitions will not only not harm the health and life of the working class, but also greatly promote the improvement of socialist and new democratic productivity. At the same time, the lives of workers can be gradually improved and raised under the condition of continuous improvement of productivity. Therefore, it is completely unconfusable compared to the capitalist class in capitalist society who disregard the life and death of workers and force workers to strengthen their labor intensity without limits only to extract surplus value for themselves.
    Labor Organization - Cooperation and Division of Labor Can Improve Productivity
    Finally, labor organization, including cooperation and division of labor. Under the conditions of the development of productive forces to a certain extent, although individual labor can be carried out and will have results if labor is not organized, the results and efficiency of organized labor must be better and greater than the results and efficiency of individual, unorganized labor. Therefore, labor organization is also one of the conditions that can improve productivity. The reason why labor organization can improve productivity is due to the results of labor adopting the form of cooperation and division of labor, an organized form of labor. Cooperation is the form in which the majority of laborers are combined, or labor power is organized, under unified leadership and command, and everyone collectively engages in the same labor. This kind of cooperation is called simple cooperation, such as collective land reclamation, weeding, ditching, river repair, collective moving of things, collective transportation, and so on.
    Collective Labor and Its Benefits
    Collective labor must organize labor power, and organize it well and allocate it well. People can cooperate in the same step and act in coordination, can exert greater power than the sum of individual labor, and obtain greater results than the sum of individual labor. For example, to build houses, if built collectively, they can be built from all directions at the same time, and built quickly. In particular, certain labor operations must be completed collectively. For example, moving a large tree requires fifteen people to move it, and it must be moved by fifteen people, which cannot be reduced. It can never be moved by one person in fifteen times, just as moving small things can be moved by one person in fifteen times. Therefore, a complete thing cannot be used to disperse labor power, and the collective strength must be organized, and labor power must be used collectively to carry out and complete. In addition, some labor must also be done by collective strength. For example, sowing and plowing, which must be completed during the rainy season, and late sowing will not be planted. Harvesting must also be done early, which requires organizing collective strength to carry out shock sowing during the rainy season and organizing collective strength to carry out collective harvesting during the harvest season to achieve "not violating the agricultural season." Especially in the case of war, if the harvest is delayed in the border area, it will be robbed by the enemy. Many people can harvest it in a short period of time, so that losses will not be suffered due to excessive delays.
    Collective labor has many other benefits, because people labor together (i.e., collective labor), the labor enthusiasm, labor initiative, creativity, and even the competitive spirit of the laborers can be greatly improved and brought into play. At the same time, it can also save tools, save labor time, and labor power. First, in terms of saving tools, individual labor requires one person to have a set of tools, or one family to have a set of tools. However, if organized to carry out collective labor, not only can labor power be mutually adjusted, labor can be divided, and each other can be complemented, but tools can also be exchanged and used in rotation, sharing what one has with another. A set of tools can be used by several people, or several families alternately or collectively. The saving of labor time is also the same. The labor that originally took one person several days to complete can be completed in half a day or several hours due to the result of collective labor. Furthermore, due to the improvement of labor enthusiasm, labor initiative, competitive spirit, and creativity in collective labor, efficiency can be greatly improved, and labor time can be saved. The result of the saving of labor time is inevitably the saving of labor power. In short, organizing collective labor can greatly improve efficiency. This improved efficiency is greater than the sum of the efficiency of individual labor. In the past agricultural production in the liberated areas, the result of labor mutual aid and exchange labor could generally increase productivity by 30% to 50%, and in some places even reached 100% and 200%. In the transportation industry, collective labor was often used in the labor process in the past. For example, dock workers moved goods from ships to the shore, or from the shore to ships. Some of them moved individually, and some moved in a collective labor manner, that is, the porters first piled the goods together, and then arranged them in one or two rows at certain intervals to pass them on to each other, and the result was faster than moving them individually. During the Anti-Japanese War, during the Great Production Movement in Yan'an, everyone went to the Yan River to fetch water. At first, one person carried one load at a time. Later, it was changed to queuing for transmission, which was faster. Later, this transmission method was also used for storage, and the efficiency was also accelerated. Because this collective transmission and handling method can save a lot of individual handling round trip time, and can also play a role in mutual promotion, encouragement, and supervision, therefore, the labor efficiency is greater than that of individual labor.
    The Historical Development of Cooperation
    The so-called cooperation (some people call it co-industry, and some people call it cooperation), according to Marx, is "the form in which the majority of laborers carry out labor in the same production process, or in different but interconnected production processes, in a planned, parallel, and mutually assisted manner." It "not only improves individual productivity, but also creates a productive force - collective force." (Capital, Volume 1, Part 4, Chapter 11). This simple form of cooperation, in primitive communist society, is based on the common ownership of the means of production and the relationship of individuals not being separated from the race or primitive communal society, and the scope of cooperation is limited to the scope of primitive clans, families, and races. In ancient society and feudal society, although the scale of cooperation once reached a large scale, it was based on the deprivation of producers of the means of production, and under a subordinate position, that is, the relationship of slaves or semi-slaves. In the economy of independent small producers, the cooperation of self-cultivating farmers and independent handicraftsmen is based on the dispersed individual ownership of the means of production, that is, based on the individual economy. It is a labor organization in which farmers and independent handicraftsmen implement mutual assistance in the production process, and voluntarily combine between people or in units of several households.

　　政治经济学教程绪论（８）
  　政治经济学的研究对象任务及其特点
    第一章　生产方式
    第一节　生产
    它是可以提高生产力的。在资本主义社会里它本是资本家加强榨取工人阶级剩余价值惯用的方法之一。资本家往往提高机器的速度，扩大同一劳动者所监视的机器范围，即扩大同一劳动者的劳动范围，同时又利用特别的工资制度来刺戟饵诱工人不断地加强自己的劳动强度来提高劳动生产率，以加强剥削工人。但过度的劳动强度是有害于工人的健康与生命的，并会增加危险。过度的劳动强度，或劳动的过分紧张，会使工人们很快丧失劳动能力，很快衰老，容易招致各种疾病并也容易使企业发生各种灾害，使工人遭受损伤。但是在工人阶级自觉的基础上，与在劳动条件适当的改造的情况下，适当地提高劳动强度，对劳动生产力的提高与发展还是可以，而且对工人阶级也是无害的。例如在社会主义与新民主主义企业里劳动竞赛中劳动强度合理的提高，不仅不会损害了工人阶级的健康与生命，并对社会主义与新民主主义生产力的提高也会引起很大的作用。同时工人的生活也可在生产力不断提高的条件下，得以逐步地随着改善与提高。故较诸资本主义社会资本家阶级不顾工人死活只为自己榨取剩余价值而强迫工人无限制地加强劳动强度是完全不可混淆的。
    劳动组织——协力与分工可以提高生产力
    最后、劳动组织，包括协力与分工。在生产力发展到一定程度的条件下，劳动不加组织，虽然个别的也可以进行劳动，而且也会有结果，可是，有组织劳动的结果与效率，一定要比个别的、无组织的劳动的结果与郊率来得好，来得大。因此劳动组织也是可以提高生产力的条件之一。劳动组织所以能提高生产力，这是由于劳动采取了协力与分工，有组织劳动的方式的结果。协力是多数劳动者结合起来，或者把劳动力组织起来，在统一的领导指挥之下，大伙儿集体地来从事同一劳动的形式。这种协力叫做单纯的协力，例如集体开荒、锄草、开渠、修河，集体搬运东西、集体运输等等。
    集体劳动及其好处
    集体劳动要把劳动力组织起来，并且要组织得好，配备得好，人们彼此就可以同一步调协同动作，可以发挥比个体劳动总和还大的力量，得到比个体劳动总和还大的效果。例如修盖房屋，如果集体的来盖，就可以从四面八方同时盖拢来，盖得就快。特别是某些劳动作业，必须集体来完成，例如搬一棵大树，需要十五个人来搬，就必须十五个人来搬，不能减少，决不能一个人分十五次来搬，好象搬零碎东西可以一个人分十五次来搬一样。因此一件完整的东西，不能分散使用劳动力，必须组织集体的力量，集体的使用劳动力才能进行与完成。此外还有些劳动，也是必须集体力量才能做的，例如播种耕耘等，在雨水季节必须播种完了，迟了就种不上，收割也须早收，那就需要在雨水期间组织集体力量突击下种，在收割期间组织集体力量集体收割，做到“不违农时”。尤其在战争情况下，边沿区收割迟了，就会被敌人抢走，许多人短时间内就可以割完，不致因为时间拖延过长而遭受损失。
    集体劳动还有许多其他好处，因为人们大伙儿在一块劳动（即集体劳动），劳动者的劳动热忱，劳动积极性，创造性以至于彼此的竞争心，都可以大大提高发挥，同时还可以节省工具，节省劳动时间与劳动力。先就节省工具言，个体劳动时，需要一个人有一套工具，或者一家有一套工具。但是如果组织起来，进行集体劳动，不但劳动力可以相互调剂，劳动可以进行分工，彼此截长补短，工具也可以相互交换轮替使用，互通有无，一套工具可以几个人，或几家人家交替或集体地使用。劳动时间的节省，也是如此，本来一个人几天才能完成的劳动，由于集体劳动的结果，半天或几小时就可以完成了。再由于集体劳动中劳动热忱、劳动积极性、竞争心与创造性的发挥提高，更可以大大的提高效率，节省劳动时间。由于劳动时间的节省，因而劳动力也得以节省，其结果乃是必然而至的。总而言之，组织起来进行集体劳动，郊率可以大大提高，这提高了的效率，比起个体劳动的效率相加起来的总和还要来得大。解放区过去农业生产中，劳动互助变工的结果，生产力一般可以提高百分之三十至五十，有的地方甚至达到百分之百，与百分之二百。在运输业方面，集体劳动在劳动过程中过去也是常常使用的，例如码头工人从船上搬运货物到岸上，或者从岸上搬运货物到船上，有个别地搬运的，也有用集体劳动方式搬运的，即搬运夫先把东西堆在一起，然后排成一条或两条行列相互保持一定间隔来传递，结果比个别地搬运搬的快。抗日时期，延安大生产运动时，大家到延水边打水，先是一个人一个人一担一担的挑，后来改为排队传递，就快了，以后收藏时也是采用这种传递方法，郊率也加快了。因为这样集体传递搬运的方法，可以节省许多个别搬运往返的时间，并且彼此间还可以起相互推动、鼓励、督促的作用，因此劳动效率，此个别劳动就要大了。
    协力的史的发展
    所谓协力（有人叫做协业，又有人叫做合作），依据马克思的说法，是“多数劳动者，在同一生产过程中，或者不同的而又相互联络的诸生产过程中，有计划地，相并地，互助地进行劳动的形态。”它“不仅提高了个别的生产力，并且创造了一种生产力——即集体力。”（资本论第一卷第四篇第十一章）。这种单纯的协力形态，在原始共产社会，是以生产手段的共有与各个人不脱离种族或原始共同社会的关系为基础，协力范围也仅限于原始氏族、家族及种族的范围以内。在古代社会与封建社会里，协力的规模虽然曾经达到了大的规模，但是它是以生产者被剥夺生产手段，处于被支配的地位下，即奴隶或半奴隶的隶属关系为基础的。在独立小生产者的经济中，自耕农民与独立手工业者的协力，则是以生产手段的分散的个体所有，即以个体经济为基础，它是农民与独立手工业者在生产过程中实行互助，在人与人之间或以几户几家为单位自愿结合起来的劳动组织。  （未完）
