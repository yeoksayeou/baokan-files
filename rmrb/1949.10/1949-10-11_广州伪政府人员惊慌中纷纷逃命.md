Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 10th: According to Guangzhou sources, as the People's Liberation Army makes great strides towards South China, officials of the Guangzhou Kuomintang puppet government are fleeing for their lives in panic. As of a few days ago, only a little more than 900 personnel remained in the bandit gang's Guangzhou-based organs. On the 8th, a decision was made to "evacuate" another 500 people. Although the puppet Executive Yuan notified that the "evacuation" would only begin on the 11th, everyone had already started to flee on the 8th.

    【新华社北京十日电】据广州消息：在人民解放军向华南大举进军之下，广州国民党伪政府人员纷纷逃命。匪帮留穗机关人员至日前止仅余九百多人，八日决定再度“疏散”五百人。虽然伪行政院通知自十一日起才开始“疏散”、但八日起大家即已开始逃跑。
