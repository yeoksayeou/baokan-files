　　Prague Dispatch
　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 14th—TASS, Moscow: The Pravda published on the 12th a Prague dispatch by Saslavsky, reporting on Czechoslovakia's economic development and the situation in New Prague, stating: The first year of Czechoslovakia's first Five-Year Plan is drawing to a close. Industrial reports for the first eight months indicate over-fulfillment of the plan. Slovakia is striving to make up for the backwardness of its industry caused by the bourgeois regime. The agricultural plan is being completed, and the production situation is very different from previous years, so Czechoslovakia's rationing system, which has been in place for ten years, is beginning to be abolished. In domestic trade, private capital is continuously retreating. Foreign trade continues to develop, and the attempts by the Marshall Plan countries to jointly resist Czechoslovak exports have failed. The recent industrial exposition showed that Czechoslovakia has found abundant markets for its industries. The Soviet pavilion at the exposition was a great success. Reality shows that the market is by no means limited to Western Europe and the Americas; cooperation with the Soviet Union has opened up broader prospects for international trade. Old Czechoslovakia was often troubled by its proximity to those insatiable imperialist countries. It feared capitalist Germany and was once dependent on capitalist France. The memory of Munich is a brand on the heart of every patriotic Czech. But New Czechoslovakia, New Prague, is tranquil. The warmongering incited by the Anglo-American general staffs has been blocked by the strong border separating the people's democratic countries and the capitalist world. Friendship with the Soviet Union is the main theme of Czechoslovakia's socialist labor symphony. Prague, in the capitalist era, was a capital with a small population; under socialism, it has become densely populated. Walking on the central streets of Prague has become more difficult. The sidewalks cannot accommodate the endless stream of pedestrians, and large groups of vehicles line up in front of traffic lights. Domestically produced trucks, mostly the more powerful Tatra and the smaller Skoda models, are predominant. The development of the automobile industry is obvious even without statistics. People can see many large Czechoslovak-made buses and trucks on the country's good roads. Tractors, more powerful than those before the war, are also ubiquitous. Workers are the new masters of Prague, taking better care of the capital on every occasion. Prague is decorated with new monuments and new buildings. Prague represents the people's heroic struggle for independence and the revolutionary labor movement.

　　新捷克空前繁荣
    萨斯拉夫斯基
    【新华社北京十四日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：十二日真理报刊载萨斯拉夫斯基布拉格通讯，报道捷克斯洛伐克底经济发展和新布拉格情况称：捷克斯洛伐克第一个五年计划的头一年正接近结束。头八个月的工业报告说明了已经超计划地完成。斯洛伐克正努力补救工业在资产阶级政权时代所造成的落后状态。农业计划在完成中，生产状况与前几年大不相同了，捷克斯洛伐克实行达十年之久的配给制度因而开始废除。国内贸易方面，私人资本连续不断地败退。国外贸易继续发展着，马歇尔化国家集团联合抵制捷克斯洛伐克出口的企图已告失败了。最近工业博览会表明捷克斯洛伐克找到了工业所需的丰富的市场。苏联陈列厅在博览会上获得了巨大的成功。现实生活表明了市场决不仅仅限于西欧和美洲，与苏联合作已启开了国际贸易的更广大的远景。旧的捷克斯洛伐克常因邻接那贪得无厌的帝国主义国家而困恼。她害怕资本主义德国，又曾依附于资本主义的法国，慕尼黑的回忆是每一个捷爱国者心上的一块烙印。但新捷克斯洛伐克、新布拉格则是安谧的。英美参谋总部煽动的战争狂，已被分隔人民民主国家和资本主义世界的强有力的边界阻遏住了。与苏联的友谊，是捷克斯洛伐克社会主义劳动交响乐中的主调。布拉格在资本主义时代，是个人口较少的首都，在社会主义之下，它变得人烟稠密了。在布拉格的中心大街上行走，已变得比较困难。行人道容纳不下川流不息的行人，在交通灯之前排着大群大群的车辆。本地制造的卡车，马力较大的塔特拉式和马力较小的斯科达式卡车居多。汽车工业的发展即使没有统计数字也可以显而易见地看到，人们在国内良好公路上可以看见许多捷克斯洛伐克自造的大型公共汽车和大卡车。马力比战前大的拖拉机也随处可见。工人是布拉格的新主人，在任何场合中都把首都照顾得更好。布拉格被新的纪念碑、新的建筑物装饰着。布拉格代表着人民争取独立的英勇斗争，代表着革命的劳工运动。
