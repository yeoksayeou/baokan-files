　　Xinhua News Agency, Central China Front, 13th: A frontline reporter reported on the People's Liberation Army's capture of Anjiang, an important junction on the Xiang-Gui and Xiang-Qian highways, and the pursuit and annihilation of more than 5,000 fleeing enemies, stating: On October 2nd, a unit of the People's Liberation Army spent two days and one night traversing the Luozi Mountains, a sparsely populated area of 180 li from Xupu. The soldiers cut through thorns and braved the rain, advancing with determination. When their shoes were worn out, they ran barefoot, sometimes taking advantage of breaks in the march to repair their shoes and quickly weave straw sandals. They overcame countless difficulties on the march and arrived at Jiangkou Town at the scheduled time, cutting off the remnants' escape route to the east and annihilating more than 300 enemies. The main force of a unit of the People's Liberation Army, starting on the 2nd, marched continuously for 200 li at a speed of eating one meal in one day and one night, relentlessly pursuing the enemy fleeing south from Yuxiewan, south of Huaihua. On the way, the fleeing enemy burned bridges. The commanders and fighters of a reconnaissance company and a spearhead company of a certain regiment, with fearless heroism, rushed through the raging fire of some bridges, chasing after the remnants and forcing the fleeing enemy to be unable to destroy other bridges, enabling our pursuing army to advance smoothly. On the 3rd, when the People's Liberation Army followed the fleeing enemy to the opposite bank of Anjiang, the remnants attempted to stubbornly resist by relying on the natural barrier of the Yuan River. Four soldiers from a spearhead company displayed a high degree of heroism, braving the rain to jump into the Yuan River and seize enemy boats that were fleeing towards Anjiang. The main force then launched a forced crossing under enemy fire. Three soldiers of the People's Liberation Army also forced an entire platoon of stubbornly resisting remnants to surrender and be captured. As the main force landed successively, the remnants set fire to houses along the coast in an attempt to prevent the People's Liberation Army from advancing. The soldiers of the People's Liberation Army then fought while putting out the fire, wiping out more than 600 remnants guarding Anjiang in one fell swoop. After annihilating the remnants in Anjiang, the People's Liberation Army continued to march rapidly at a speed of 12 li per hour, chasing 120 li and catching up with a large group of fleeing remnants in the Jinping and Yanjiao areas between Anjiang and Qianyang. After an hour of fierce fighting, the more than 4,000 fleeing bandits were completely annihilated. The unit of fleeing bandits annihilated was identified as the Fifth Directly Subordinate Assault Column of the Ministry of National Defense, the Directly Subordinate Team of the 100th Army, and parts of the Kuomintang Hunan Refugee Provincial Government and the Joint Logistics Headquarters. In this battle, hundreds of vehicles and countless supplies were captured. The People's Liberation Army has thus reached the border of Guizhou.

　　猛烈追歼南逃残匪五千
    解放军直抵贵州边境
    前线记者报道攻占安江歼敌经过
    【新华社华中前线十三日电】前线记者报道解放军攻占湘桂公路及湘黔公路重要联络点安江，追歼逃敌五千余的经过称：十月二日解放军某部以两天一夜的时间，从溆浦穿越一百八十里罕有人烟的罗子山，战士们披荆斩棘冒雨前进，鞋子爬坏了就赤着脚跑，有时利用行军间隙抢补鞋子和赶打草鞋，克服了进军途中的无数艰难困苦，在预定时间赶到江口镇，截断残匪东逃之路，并歼敌三百余。解放军某部主力，则自二日起，以一昼夜间吃一顿饭连续急行军二百里的速度，穷追怀化以南榆榭湾南逃之敌。途中逃敌焚毁桥梁，某团侦察连及尖兵连指战员们奋不顾身从部分桥梁的熊熊大火中冲过桥去，猛追残匪，迫使狼狈南逃残匪不能破坏其他桥梁，使我追击大军得以顺利前进。三日，解放军尾追逃敌至安江对岸时，残匪妄图凭借沅水天险顽强抵抗，某部尖兵连四个战士发扬了高度的英勇精神，冒雨跳入沅水，夺取了正向安江逃跑的敌船，大军随即在敌人炮火下进行强渡。解放军尖兵三人并迫令正在顽抗的残敌一个排全部缴枪就俘。当大军陆续登陆后，残匪复纵火燃烧沿岸村屋，企图阻挠解放军前进，解放军的战士们遂一面救火，一面战斗，一举将据守安江的残匪六百余人全部消灭。解放军在消灭安江残匪后，接着又以一小时十二里的急行军，猛追一百二十里，在安江、黔阳间的金屏、岩脚地区追上南逃大股残匪，经一小时猛烈激战，即将该股逃匪四千余人全歼。该股被歼逃匪番号为国防部第五直属突击纵队、一百军军直属队及国民党湖南流亡省政府与联勤总部各一部。此次战斗缴获汽车百辆，辎重无数。解放军由此直抵贵州边境。
