　　Short Notes from the Hungarian Capital
　　Zigang
　　On August 9th, as we passed through various stations in Hungary from the Soviet-Hungarian border, we discovered something new and peculiar: heartfelt enthusiasm.

　　This enthusiasm could neither be feigned nor carried out under orders. At that time, Hungary had not seen rain for two months, and the weather was extremely arid and sultry. However, the enthusiasm of the millions of people along the stations moistened the hearts of over a hundred Chinese youths, dispelling the feeling of unfamiliarity in a foreign land.

　　Hungary, with a population of 9.2 million, was completely mobilized for the World Youth Student Festival. Every station was decorated with national flags and red flags, even more beautifully than during the New Year. Young men and women, children, and even the elderly came to greet us, offering flowers and fruits, shaking hands, and blowing kisses. From that day on, we learned to shake hands firmly, learned "Jó napot" (Hello), and learned that when someone kisses you, you have to kiss them back.

　　The Budapest train station is not small, but it could not accommodate so many welcoming crowds. Our small group member, Shang Hongyou, was hoisted onto shoulders and spun around. When we, along with Soviet representatives (a portion) and Korean representatives, exited the station, we had already been enthusiastically welcomed for over an hour.

　　We were like explorers, continuing to discover, and another discovery was the victory of China.

　　The victory of China, discovered abroad, felt fresh. Indeed, it was a discovery. From the faces and mouths of the people of Budapest, from the position where our national flag (temporarily replaced by the military flag) was hung, today's free KÍNA (Hungarian for China) is truly outstanding. Several representatives of the People's Liberation Army attracted even more attention.

　　Those Young Pioneer members in gray cloth shirts and red scarves, those Young Pioneers in white shirts and blue scarves, those Hungarian women skilled at coordinating clothing colors, those men and women, young and old, used every means to get close to the Chinese: signing autographs, taking photos, exchanging commemorative badges, visiting, wanting you to eat a piece of their candy, wanting you to accept their party and youth league souvenirs, wanting you to wear a small trinket. Three daring young girls, around twelve or thirteen years old, came to find us. After sitting down, their first question was: "What is life like in China...?" We were amused by this immensely broad question. So, we started from talking about using chopsticks. Crowds often gathered outside our door to see the Chinese. An old man brought his two daughters to wait specifically for a female member of the performing arts troupe. A few days later, one of his daughters dyed her hair black, wore a cheongsam, tucked a red scarf around her waist, and styled her hair in two small braids. They asked if she looked like she was doing the Yangko dance.

　　Five hundred thousand young people served the World Youth Festival. Starting with carrying luggage at the train station, they were also the ones who carried props to the theater for each performance. In fact, the number of people mobilized was more than that. Factories held labor hero competitions, waiting for youth representatives to listen to their summaries and watch the award ceremonies. The harvest in the countryside was inspired by the World Youth Festival. Farming couples brought their children to the city to participate in the Youth Festival's programs, and the government provided them with accommodation. When our basketball team went to the countryside for friendly matches, the farmers made heart-shaped and circular breads, cut large pieces of pork, and embroidered flower shoes as gifts. One place presented more than forty gifts, and one game attracted six thousand spectators.

　　The Minister of Food said: For the World Youth Festival, they made an extra two hundred kilometers of sausages to entertain the guests. A cartoon showed a pig questioning the price of goods: Why is the price of pork being suppressed so low? The answer was: It's for the World Youth Festival.

　　Hungary has had continuous celebrations in recent years. Last year, it just celebrated the centenary of the 1848 Revolution. Now, it is the second year of the three-year plan after liberation, which should be completed by the end of next year, but preparations are being made in many areas to complete it in two and a half years. The five-year plan has already been drafted.

　　Today's Budapest has risen again from the ruins. The Second World War brought this famous city to the brink of irreversible destruction. All seven major bridges on the Danube River were destroyed. During the last winter, Buda and Pest were separated, with water and electricity cut off. The working people living in Buda could not cross to the other side to work. People risked their lives to walk across the thin ice. Near the museum, there is a row of bungalows and shops, which is extremely conspicuous in this world of western-style buildings. It was also a gift of the war, somewhat reminiscent of the new shops that appeared on the streets of Chongqing after the massive bombings. Even today, the ruins of large buildings that have not yet been repaired can still be seen. The people of Buda like to point them out to us, their voices carrying a tone of accusation.

　　The Royal Palace on Buda Castle Hill was also completely destroyed. After clearing away the broken walls and rubble, archaeologists were given an opportunity to study history.

　　The blue Danube River may just be the illusion of poets and musicians, but the scenery on the Danube River is indeed captivating. The Liberty Statue on Gellért Hill is a shining gem in the hearts of Hungarians. When the tram passes over the bridge and the statue comes into view, a mother teaches her three-year-old child to recognize it: "Beneath the Liberty Statue holding a palm leaf is the Red Army Memorial Tower that liberated us!" The three-year-old child widens his eyes and nods, as if also thanking the Soviet army that liberated his country and compatriots before he was born. Flowers are often piled there, and the heroic spirits of 15,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers live forever in the hearts and on the lips of the Hungarian people.

　　Another gem in the hearts of Hungarians is Petőfi, the national poet who participated in leading the 1848 Revolution. His statues and photos can be seen everywhere, in workers' clubs, on bulletin boards, and in art galleries. His hairstyle is somewhat like Pushkin, with his right arm stretched out, gesturing to summon the masses. His poems once inspired the fighting spirit.

　　The gem in the eyes of Hungarians is Rákosi, the leader of the Communist Party (now renamed the Hungarian Working People's Party), who was imprisoned for fifteen years and is proficient in eight languages. He has been engaged in the workers' movement for forty years of his life. This short, balding, kind-faced little old man is loved by the people of the whole country. He gave a speech at the closing ceremony of the World Youth Festival, welcoming delegations from various countries. He pointed out that Hungary, which had suffered from four hundred years of colonial pain, was still groaning under the iron heels of the Hitler gang five years ago. This is the reason why the Hungarian people particularly love the youth of fighting nations.

　　Today, 73 percent of the members of the Hungarian Parliament are representatives of workers and peasants. Many of the large group of young people who came to visit the Chinese delegation were workers. But apart from the fact that their shirts might be a bit old, we would not be able to recognize them. One worker showed us his hands with thick calluses. When he discovered that few of our delegation members had the same working people's hands as him, he shook his head and smiled.

　　Workers' homes, workers' sanatoriums, workers' clubs, and the forests on Three Peaks Mountain where workers go for holidays are all prioritized for workers. Some houses of landlords and nobles have now become workers' dormitories.

　　The average weekly wage of an ordinary worker is about 120-180 forints, which is not very affluent, so many couples work together. In the town of Budafok, ten kilometers outside of Budapest, we visited the families of alcohol factory workers of three different grades. A family of four with an income of only 120 forints per week lives in a house provided by the factory that is not inferior to that of a Chinese university professor. However, they also admit that they are not very well-off, to the point that their daughter has not yet been able to go to college. Some women also said that it is not so easy to find a job. But they do not complain, and they are still very optimistic, knowing that the regime is now their own, and all construction must be done step by step. Rákosi once said: We must let the youth representatives visit as much as possible, without concealing anything. The more they know our difficulties, the more they will know the value of our success.

　　The number of publicly funded students in middle schools is not small. One-third of the six hundred students in Miss Esther's (our English translator) girls' school are on public funding, and of course, they must also have excellent grades.

　　The happiness of Hungarian children is enviable. White lacquered prams are all over the streets. When closed, they look like small cars, with awnings and glass. When the weather is fine, they can be disassembled, and the children lying in the prams are all so beautiful and healthy. If you praise a beautiful boy or girl to their mothers in Hungarian, they will be extremely happy. Many housewives from families that can afford to maintain their lifestyle still do not work outside the home, but they are also very busy, because too few families can afford a female worker; moreover, the main issue is ideological, as domestic servants will be eliminated. For example, a factory manager with an income of 1,800 forints is considered very high, but if he hires a female worker, it will cost him 400-500 forints, and he will also have to provide food.

　　In a courtyard below the hillside of the Teachers' College where we lived, there was often a group of young children napping in the shade of the wall. Everyone thought it was a nursery. When we stepped in to visit, we learned that it was actually a sanatorium for young children under the age of three with lung diseases. We do not know Hungarian, like blind men, and the sign at the door was useless. The house clearly stated: This is a small design in the three-year plan. It opened in January of this year and currently has 55 children. Some who have been cured have already been discharged. A French female doctor who married a Hungarian knew some English and led me to visit the X-ray room, treatment room, washroom, kitchen... The bedrooms were separated according to the severity of the illness and age. Some children looked even rosier than healthy children in China, but they were also suffering from early-stage lung disease. Some had very obvious symptoms. But the female doctor said that all the children admitted here have a chance of getting better. The youngest patient was only two months old, infected by his mother. He is now being fed milk from another healthy mother.

　　Some of these children are free of charge if their parents cannot afford it. If there were no three-year plan, they would all die.

　　The people of Budapest are proud to have a Young Pioneer station and a Young Pioneer town, which is a transportation organization managed by children themselves. From the locomotive to the train station on the train, they are all managed by boys and girls aged eight to fourteen. They are all top students in their schools. Each person comes to the station twice a week to practice. Only top students have this opportunity. Each of them wears a badge of excellent student. The adults riding the train are very proud. The journey from the station to the town is only five minutes. And the station and the train body are very resplendent.

　　The residents of Budapest like to show people beautiful smiles, but they are also willing to recall history to encourage themselves and others to move forward. Looking at the prosperity and happiness of today's Budapest, they always say:

　　"Budapest was destroyed terribly. It is not a simple matter to rebuild it to this state today."

　　People are beginning to understand the meaning of the most common slogan, "Defend Peace."

　　匈京短简
    子冈
    八月九日，我们从苏匈边境途经匈牙利各站的时候，就发现了一样新奇的东西。那就是出自衷心的热情。
    这种热情既不能矫饰，也不能奉令而行。当时匈牙利正两月未雨，天气很亢旱燠闷，沿站千千万万人民的热情却润湿了一百多中国青年的心，把来到异国的生疏之感消失了。
    九百二十万人口的匈牙利为了世界青年学生节完全动员起来了，每站被各国国旗和红旗装饰得比过年还美丽，男女青年孩子甚至老人也来迎接，送花送水果，握手飞吻，从那一天起我们学习紧紧地握手，学习宾尔布斯（你好），学习当人家吻你时，你也得吻他。
    布达佩斯的车站不小，但是怎样大也装不了那么多的欢迎群众呵。我们的小团员尚鸿佑，被抱在肩上转来转去。当我们和苏联代表（一部分）和朝鲜代表出站时，已在站内被狂热地欢迎了一点多钟了。
    我们象探险家，要继续发现下去，又一个发现即是中国的胜利。
    中国的胜利而在国外发现，透着新鲜。是的，这实在是一桩发现呢，从布达佩斯人民的脸上、口中，从我们的国旗（暂以军旗代）悬挂的位置上，今日的自由ＫＩＮＡ（匈文中国）真是顶括括的呀。几位解放军代表更引人注意。
    那些灰布衬衫红领巾的青年团团员，那些白衬衣蓝领巾的少先队队员，那些善于调配衣服颜色的匈牙利妇女，那些男女老幼，用尽了一切方法来亲近中国人：签字，拍照，交换纪念章，拜访，要你吃他一块糖，要你接受他的党团纪念物，要你佩挂一个小玩意。有三个十二、三岁的大胆小女孩来找我们，坐下来以后第一个问题是：“中国的生活怎么样啊……。”我们都被这大得无边际的问题逗笑了。于是从拿筷子说起。我们门前经常围了些等看中国人的群众，有一个老头领了两个女儿来专门等候文工团一位女团员。过了几天，他的一个女儿也染了黑发穿了一件旗袍来了，腰间塞了一块红巾，梳了两个小辫，他们问象不象扭秧歌的样子。
    五十万青年为世界青年节服务。从车站搬行李做起，每次演戏去剧院搬道具的也是他们。事实上动员的人不止这个数目。工厂里进行劳动英雄竞赛，等候青年代表去听总结，看给奖。农间的收割都受到世青节大会的鼓舞。农民夫妇们带了孩子进城来参加青年节的节目，政府招待他们住宿。当我们的篮球队下乡作友谊球赛的时候，农民作了心形圆圈形的大面包，割了大块猪肉，绣了花鞋来送礼，一个地方献礼四十多件，一场球赛引来六千观众。
    粮食部部长说：为了世青节，他们多作了二百公里长的香肠来待客。漫画上一只小猪在质问物价：为什么把猪肉价格压得那么低？回答是说：为了在开世青节呀。
    匈牙利连年喜庆，去年刚过了一八四八年革命百周纪念，现在正是解放后三年计划的第二年，应该明年年底完成，但多方面已作两年半完成的准备，五年计划已然订好了。
    今日的布达佩斯是从废墟中又站立起来的，第二次世界大战曾使这名城几乎陷于永劫不复的境地，多瑙河上七顶大桥全被破坏，最后一个冬天布达和佩斯两边隔绝，水电皆停，住在布达的劳动人民不能过对岸去作工，人们冒了生命危险从薄冰上走过去。在博物馆附近有一排平房商店，在这洋楼世界中极为触目，那也是大战的赐与，有点象重庆街头大轰炸后出现了些新商店的神气。至今仍可见到还没能修复的大厦残骸，布城人民喜欢地指给我们看，声音中带着控诉的调子。
    布达古堡山上的皇宫也毁坏无遗，打扫掉断墙残瓦以后，考古学家们倒得到了一个机会来研究历史。
    蓝色的多瑙河或者只是诗人音乐家的幻觉，但多瑙河上的景物确实诱人。格勒特山上的自由神像是匈牙利人心头的发亮的宝石，电车经过大桥望得到神像时，一个母亲在教她的三岁孩子辨认：“手擎棕榈叶的自由神像下便是解放我们的红军纪念塔！”三岁孩子张大眸子点点头，仿佛也在感谢那在他出生前解放了他的祖国和同胞的苏军的样子。那儿常堆了鲜花，一万五千苏联红军的英雄长存在匈牙利人民心中唇上。
    匈牙利人心上的另一颗宝石是参加领导一八四八年革命的民族诗人彼多斐，到处可以见到他的塑像和照片，在工人俱乐部里，在壁报上，在美术馆中。头型有些象普式庚，右臂远伸，作向群众召唤的姿态。他的诗篇曾鼓舞战斗。
    匈牙利人眼前的宝石是拉科西，这个坐狱十五年精通八国语言的共产党（现改称劳动人民党）领袖，他一生中有四十年从事工人运动。这后脑微秃、身材不高、满面慈祥的小老头，受到全国人民的爱戴。他在世青节闭幕礼中曾作讲演，欢迎各国代表团外，曾指出受过四百年殖民地痛苦的匈牙利在五年前还在希特勒匪帮铁蹄下呻吟，这是匈牙利人民特别热爱战斗国家青年的原因。
    如今匈牙利国会构成分子百分之七十三是工人农民的代表。几次来访中国代表团的大群青年人中有不少工人。但是除了衬衣也许旧一点而外，我们会认不出来。有一个工人曾给我们看他生着厚厚的茧皮的双手，当他发现我们的团员很少有和他同样的劳动人民的手的时候，他摇摇头笑了。
    工人之家，工人疗养院，工人俱乐部，三峰山上工人假日游览的森林，首先关顾到工人。有些地主贵族的房子，如今成了工人宿舍。
    普通一个工人的每星期工资约一百二三十至一百七八十福林，这不算很充裕，所以夫妇同在作工的很多。在布达佩斯十公里外的布达佛克镇上，我们看了酒精厂三个等级的工人家庭。收入每周才一百二十个福林的一个四口人的家庭，厂中供应的房屋也和一个中国的大学教授不相上下。只是他们也承认并不很宽裕，以至女儿还没有升学。有些妇女也表示求职并非那么容易。但是他们并不抱怨，仍很乐观，知道政权已是自己的了，一切建设得逐步来。拉科西也曾经说：我们要让青年代表们尽量参观，不加掩饰，愈知道我们的困难，愈知道我们成功的价值。
    在中学里公费生的名额并不少。我们的英文翻译爱瑟小姐的女校中有六百学生，三分之一有公费，自然也须成绩优良。
    匈牙利孩子们的幸福是可羡的，白漆的手车满街都是，关起来象辆小汽车，有篷有玻璃，天晴时可以拆卸，而躺在车里的孩子又十九都是那么漂亮健康，你如果用匈语向母亲们赞美一下美丽的男孩或女孩，她们高兴极了。经济可以维持的家庭主妇不在外工作的仍很多，但她们也很忙碌，因为能担负得起一个女工的家庭太少了；而且主要是思想问题，家庭佣仆会被淘汰。例如一个工厂经理收入一千八百福林是很高的了，但他若请一个女工，得四五百福林，另外还得供伙食。
    在我们住的师范学院山坡下的一所庭院里，常有一群幼孩在墙荫下边午睡，大家以为是托儿所，当踏进去访问时，才知道原来是为三岁以下肺病幼儿所设的疗养院。我们不认识匈文，如同瞎子，门口的招牌失去了效用。房子上写明：这是三年计划里的一个小设计，今年一月开办，目前有五十五个小孩，有些治好的已然出院。一位嫁给匈牙利人的法国女医师会一些英语，领我参观Ｘ光室，诊疗室，盥洗室，厨房………卧室是按病情年龄分开的。有些孩子看来比中国的健康孩子还红润，但也在犯初期肺病，有些却病情十分显著了。但这位女医生说凡是收容进来的孩子都是有希望好的。最小的病人才两个月，受母亲传染，现在移用别位健康母亲的奶水来哺养。
    这些孩子们有些是免费的，倘若他们的父母担负不起。假定没有三年计划，他们都会死亡。
    布达佩斯的人很骄傲他们有一个少先车站和少先镇，那是一个孩子们自己管理的交通机构，自机车到车上车站，都由八岁到十四岁的男女孩子们掌管。他们都是各校的高材生，每人每周有两次来到车站实习，只有高材生才有这种机会。他们每人身上佩了优秀学生的证章。乘车的大人们都十分洋洋得意。车站到镇上只有五分钟的路程。而车站和车身都十分锦碧辉煌。
    布达佩斯居民们喜欢给人看美丽的笑脸，但他们也愿意回忆历史，来策励自己和别人前进，看着今日布城的繁荣和幸福，他们总说：
    “布达佩斯被毁坏得惨啊，修建到今天这个样子不是件简单事情。”
    人们开始明了最习见的“保卫和平”那张标语的意义。
