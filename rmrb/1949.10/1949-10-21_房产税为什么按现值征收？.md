Inquiries and Answers

　　Editor:
  I. Regarding the collection of property tax, it would be best to levy it based on the amount of rent (with a reduction of a certain percentage for owner-occupied and owner-operated properties compared to rented properties). Currently, housing rents vary greatly. The same house in the same location may have the same land and property valuation. One room in house A rents for 10 kilograms of millet, while one room in house B rents for 25 kilograms of millet. Moreover, there is a significant difference between old and new rents. Because of the difference in income, it would be unfair to levy the same property tax. Furthermore, as stated in the Xinhua News Agency mailbox article about the nature and policy of urban property and rent, published in your newspaper on August 12th, rental activity is also a commercial activity, and its profit should be equivalent to the legitimate average profit in society. Therefore, property tax should be determined more fairly based on the amount of capital (total value of land and property) and profit (profit from rent after deducting depreciation and necessary repairs). If property tax is levied solely based on land and property valuation (capital) without considering the amount of rent (profit), it would be unfair.
  II. Property tax is divided into four categories: rented, business-occupied, owner-occupied, and owner-operated, and is collected quarterly. For example, if a certain house is rented out for the first month of a quarter and then owner-occupied for the following two months (the owner had not yet moved in during the survey, and the house was vacant), how should the property tax be levied? Should it be levied based on the rental rate or the owner-occupied rate?
  III. The taxpayer is the homeowner. If the lease agreement stipulates that the tenant is responsible for paying the tax, can the lease agreement be followed?
　  Reader He Renxia:
  I. Property tax is a type of property tax, levied on homeowners based on the current value of their properties. If it were levied based on the amount of housing income (rent), the same value of houses would bear different burdens due to different incomes, which would contradict the nature of property tax. Your suggestion to levy tax based on rent falls within the scope of housing rental income tax. However, rental income tax is currently exempt to encourage renting.
  II. If a declaration is made before the tax is levied, and it is verified to be true, then the tax will be assessed separately based on the rental rate for the first month and the owner-occupied rate for the following two months.
  III. It does not matter who the taxpayer entrusts to pay the tax on their behalf; however, if there is a delay in payment, the original taxpayer will still be pursued for the tax.

### 房产税为什么按现值征收？

专栏：询问与答覆

　　房产税为什么按现值征收？编者：
  一、征收房捐，最好依房租多寡而征收（自住自营按出租出营降低百分之几）。因为目前房屋租金很不一致，同样房屋处在同一地点，房地估价亦相等。甲房一间租小米十斤，乙房一间租小米二十五斤，况且新旧租也相差很多。因为收益不同，如征同样房捐，恐失公允。复依八月十二日贵报所载新华社信箱关于城市房产房租的性质和政策一文内说明，房租行为亦即商业行为，其利润要相当社会上正当的平均利润，所以房捐似应依其资本额（房地总值）和利润（房租中除去房屋折旧金和必需的修理费以外的利润）的多少而定较为公平，如仅依房地估价（资本额），不顾及房租多少（利润）而征房捐，恐失公允。
  二、房捐分出租、出营、自住、自营四种，按季征收。例如某处房屋在一季内前一个月系出租，后二个月则为自住（调查时房主尚未迁入，该房为空房），其房捐应如何征收？按出租缴捐呢？还是按自住缴捐呢？
  三、纳捐义务人为房主，如主客契约规定由房客纳捐，可否从其契约规定？
　  读者贺仁侠贺仁侠君：
  一、房产税是财产税之一，向房屋所有权人依其现值分别征税，若以房屋收益（租金）多寡计征，必定会使同样价值的房屋因收益不同而承担不同的负担，且与财产税性质相背。你提按租金征捐一节，应属房屋租赁所得税范围，现因奖励出租，故免征租赁所得税。
  二、如在开征前申报，经查属实时，则前一个月按出租捐率，后二个月按自住捐率分别核捐。
  三、纳捐义务人不论委托何人代缴，均不干涉；但有滞纳情事时，仍向原纳捐义务人追征之。
