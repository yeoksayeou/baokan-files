Organize, Unite All Employees, and Launch a High Tide of Economic Construction
　　Ten Months of Labor Movement in Shenyang
　　By Our Correspondent in Shenyang, Yao Fu
　　Organize, unite all employees, give full play to the leadership role of trade unions in production, launch a mass anti-waste campaign, create new production records, and set off a high tide of economic construction. This was the central issue discussed at the first Shenyang Workers' Congress held in mid-October. It represents the basic experience gained from ten months of the labor movement in Shenyang and marks a new stage in the Shenyang labor movement.
    (I) What Has Been Done?
    The labor movement in Shenyang has been carried out under the direct leadership of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions and the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. Significant achievements have been made in the past ten months. By the end of August, 73,368 workers from public and private factories had joined the trade union, 221 trade unions and 144 branches had been established, and 3,139 trade union committee members had been promoted. The trade union has played a significant role in leading production. In the early days of Shenyang's liberation last year, the preparatory committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions sent a considerable number of cadres to various state-owned and public factories to lead the protection of factories and resumption of work. In February of this year, it launched a campaign to dedicate equipment. Many employees took active responsibility to prevent theft and sabotage by special agents and bad elements, and dedicated many valuable equipment items. In June alone, workers from 74 factories dedicated 73,092 pieces of equipment of various kinds, worth approximately 1.7624 billion yuan (Northeast currency, same below). The three-month production emulation campaign in April, May and June to welcome the "May Day" Labor Day spread to 74 factories. Many model workers and inventions emerged. The city-wide campaign for rationalization proposals and anti-waste movement has recently seen the emergence of Zhang Shangju's model line-drawing group, and outstanding examples of technological improvements such as Zhao Guoyou, Dang Huian, Zhao Fuyou, and Chen Jimin. Trade unions at all levels in Shenyang actively promoted factory labor insurance and organized various necessary welfare undertakings. The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions helped 4,210 unemployed workers find new jobs. By July, 120 factories and 79,107 employees in the city had implemented labor insurance, accounting for 92.8 percent of the city's state-owned and public factories. Since March, organizing worker cooperatives has become one of the central tasks of the trade union. One hundred worker cooperatives have been established in the city, with members accounting for one-third of the employees in state-owned and public factories. According to statistics from 65 cooperatives, workers purchase daily necessities at lower prices, basically eliminating the intermediate exploitation of merchants. 54,833 employees have thus saved 6.320276 billion yuan. Currently, the city has 65 clinics, 94 worker canteens, 82 bathhouses, 83 barbershops, 7 nurseries, and 18 schools for workers' children.
　　The rapid change in the labor attitude of workers in Shenyang is inseparable from the trade union's leadership in carrying out political, cultural, and technical studies for employees. In the early days of liberation, the trade union gave large classes to more than 20,000 workers and opened training courses for more than 3,000 people. Later, it mobilized 18,000 representatives, group leaders, and activists to study in various training courses, worker universities, and worker schools. Currently, the city has 14 worker schools with 1,500 students. Since March, worker night schools, technical research classes, reading groups, correspondence groups, and blackboard newspapers have been organized. Currently, the city has 131 worker night schools (including workers from public and private factories) with more than 9,000 students, 534 correspondence groups, 784 blackboard newspapers, 129 libraries, 106 employee drama troupes, 107 Yangko teams, 30 literary and art groups, 181 basketball teams, and 118 clubs. The literary and art work team of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions frequently performs in various factories. Workers' political awareness has been raised, and they actively participate in various social activities. Currently, 3,574 young workers have joined the Communist Youth League. Among the 428 representatives of the Shenyang People's Representative Conference, workers account for 166.
　　Although the work of employees in private enterprises started later, it has also achieved many successes in organization, education, and learning activities. Labor disputes have been initially resolved and are being gradually resolved, gradually solving problems in wages, working hours, employment, and dismissal. The lives of employees have been initially improved, and their class consciousness has gradually increased. When re-electing neighborhood residents' groups, workers generally actively participated. Ninety percent of the workers in Tiexi District were elected as group leaders. In August, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, in conjunction with the Industry and Commerce Inspection Group, conducted a more in-depth policy publicity in various districts, which gave a new impetus to the work of the trade union. The preparatory committee of the city-wide private hardware industry trade union has been established. The iron industry is brewing the establishment of a collective labor-capital contract, and other city-wide industry trade unions are also being prepared.
    (II) Finding the Direction
　　The development of the labor movement in Shenyang in the past ten months has been tortuous and complex, and has gone through detours, but it has found its direction in the process of exploration.
　　First, the task of the trade union must be production first, facing production, and concentrating its efforts on doing a good job in production. This is the long-term and greatest interest of the working class. For quite a long time, many trade union workers were not clear about this basic idea. Although they gradually recognized the policy of the trade union leading production after May, they still lacked concrete research and failed to summarize experience. Some people still believe that the trade union is a group that leads labor insurance, welfare, and recreational activities. Since June, the general cadres have ideologically admitted that leading production is the criterion for checking the quality of trade union work, and have gained preliminary experience. The responsibility of the trade union lies in collecting mass opinions through its own organization and submitting them to the administration for research. When the administration makes a decision, it turns the administrative opinions into mass opinions through its own organization and implements them in action. Secondly, the trade union must grasp several key points to realize concrete leadership. (1) Grasp the production plan and improve group life. (2) Organize rationalization proposals and introduce advanced experience. Hold forums for advanced workers, organize visits, and hold technical forums, etc. (3) Regularly lead and carry out production emulation campaigns, currently focusing on launching anti-waste struggles and new production record campaigns. (4) Adopt various ways to carry out extensive and timely publicity and mobilization, such as blackboard newspapers, honor rolls, radio, playwriting, etc. (5) Strengthen the education of new labor attitudes and new discipline. Link political education with practice, formulate factory rules, and sign collective contracts, etc. (6) According to the principle of more work, more gain, implement material rewards. The trade union should lead publicity and give play to the enthusiasm of all employees.
　　Second, organize and unite all: Within half a year to a year, all employees who meet the membership conditions should be organized into the trade union on a voluntary basis. In the early days of liberation, there was a more serious closed-doorism tendency, and the understanding of "the trade union is a mass organization of the working class" was not clear. The political conditions of members were emphasized, the complexity within the workers was inappropriately emphasized, and even some exceeded the articles of association, and set their own probationary period, opened training courses, frankness meetings, and found guarantors before joining the union. Although it has been basically corrected from the ideological point of view of the cadres in April, there are still remnants of closed-doorism. Some backward, historically complex and newly arrived workers have not been admitted to the union in time, and the admission of staff members to the union is particularly poor. Up to now, more than 30% of the employees in public factories are still outside the union. Private enterprises that have been working are only a small part of the total number of employees, and have not vigorously organized various industry trade unions. There are still formalistic problems in trade union activities, and the actual problems that could have been solved have not been solved. There are many meetings, and the learning is not in line with the requirements, which makes some people feel troubled, so that some trade unions do not have high prestige. This conference specifically discussed the articles of association of the trade union, reasonably stipulated the conditions for joining the union, and stipulated that various industry trade unions should be established according to the nature of the industry; organize the basic organizations of the trade union, establish democratic life, adhere to the re-election every six months, change the grassroots trade union committee members into committees, and report to the members regularly; promote a large number of cadres, and implement the policy of "everyone runs the trade union."

　　组织起来，团结全体职工，掀起经济建设高潮
  　十个月来的沈阳工运
    本报驻沈阳记者 药夫
    组织起来，团结全体职工，充分发挥工会领导生产的作用，开展群众性的反浪费斗争，创造生产新纪录，掀起经济建设的高潮。这是在本月中旬召开的沈阳首届工人代表大会讨论的中心问题，是十个月来沈阳工运中得出的基本经验，也是沈阳工运走上新阶段的标帜。
    （一）作了什么？
    沈阳的工运工作是在东北职工总会与中共沈阳市委直接领导下开展起来的。十个月来，已获得相当成绩。至八月底止有七万三千三百六十八名公私营厂工人参加了工会，成立了二百二十一个工会，一百四十四个分会，提拔了工会委员三千一百三十九名。工会在领导生产上已起了很大作用。去年沈阳解放初期，市总工会筹委会即派出相当数量的干部，深入各国营公营工厂，领导护厂复工；今年二月又号召发动了献纳器材运动。许多职工积极负责，防止特务与坏分子偷盗破坏，献纳出许多宝贵器材。仅六月份内，七十四个工厂的工人献出各种器材七万三千○九十二件，约值一十七亿六千二百四十万余元（东北币下同）。为迎接“五一”劳动节掀起的四、五、六三个月生产竞赛运动，遍及七十四厂。出现了许多工作模范和创造发明。最近全市展开合理化建议和反浪费运动已经出现了张尚举模范画线小组，赵国有、党会安、赵富有、陈济民等改进技术的出色范例。沈市各级工会积极推动了工厂劳动保险与举办了各种必要的福利事业。市总工会介绍失业工人四千二百十名复业。至七月全市已有一百廿个工厂、七万九千一百○七名职工实行了劳动保险，占全市国营公营工厂百分之九十二点八，三月份以来，组织职工合作社成为工会中心工作之一。全市已组成一百个职工合作社，社员占国营公营工厂职工三分之一。据六十五个合作社统计，工人以较低价格购置生活必需品，基本上免除了商人的中间剥削。五万四千八百三十三名职工因而节省了六十三亿二千○二十七万六千余元。现全市共有医疗所六十五个，工人食堂九十四个，澡塘八十二个，理发所八十三个，托儿所七个，工人子弟学校十八个。
    沈市工人劳动态度的迅速转变，是与工会的领导开展了职工的政治、文化、技术学习分不开的。在解放初期，工会曾给两万多工人上大课，开了三千多人的训练班。以后动员代表、小组长及积极分子一万八千人到各种训练班、工人大学、工人学校学习。现全市已有十四个职工学校，学员一千五百人。三月开始组织工人夜校、技术研究班、读报组、通讯组、黑板报等，现全市已有工人夜校一百三十一个（包括公私营工厂工人），学员九千余人，五百三十四个通讯小组，七百八十四块黑板报、一百二十九个图书馆，一百○六个职工剧团，一百○七个秧歌队，三十个文艺小组，一百八十一个篮球队，一百一十八个俱乐部，市总工会所属文艺工作队，经常到各厂出演。工人政治觉悟提高了，积极参加了各种社会活动。现已有三千五百七十四名青年工人参加了青年团，在沈市人民代表会议四百二十八名代表中，工人占一百六十六人。
    私营企业职工工作虽则开展较晚，但在组织、教育和学习活动上亦收到不少成绩。并初步解决了与正在解决着劳资纠纷，逐渐解决工资、工时、雇庸、解雇等方面的问题。职工生活初步改善，阶级觉悟逐步提高。改选街道居民小组时，工人一般都积极参加了，铁西区百分之九十的工人被选为组长。市总工会于八月份结合工商考查团，到各区进行了较深入的政策宣传，对工会工作有了新的推动。建立了全市私营五金业工会筹备会，铁工业已酝酿订立劳资集体合同，其他全市性的行业工会也正在筹备中。
    （二）摸到了方向
    十个月来沈阳工运的发展是很曲折复杂的，曾经走过弯路，但在摸索中已找到了方向。
    第一，工会任务必须是生产第一，面向生产，集中力量做好生产工作。这是工人阶级的长远利益与最大利益。对于这个基本思想，许多工会工作者在颇长的时期内并不明确，五月后虽逐渐认识了工会领导生产的方针，但仍缺乏具体研究，未能总结经验。有些人还认为工会是领导劳动保险福利和文娱活动的团体，六月以来一般干部思想上都承认领导生产是检查工会工作好坏的标准，并取得了初步经验。明确了工会的责任在于通过自己的组织，搜集群众意见提交行政研究，当行政上有所决定时，又通过自己的组织，将行政意见变为群众的意见，在行动中贯彻起来。其次，工会要实现具体领导必须掌握住几个坏节。（一）要掌握生产计划，健全小组生活。（二）组织合理化建议，介绍先进经验。召开先进工作者座谈会，组织参观，召开技术座谈会等。（三）经常领导开展生产竞赛运动，目前以开展反浪费斗争与生产新纪录运动为中心。（四）采取多种多样方式进行广泛及时的宣传鼓动，如黑板报、光荣榜、广播、编剧等。（五）加强新劳动态度，新纪律的教育。政治教育与实际联系起来，制定厂规，订立集体合同等。（六）按多劳多得原则，实行物质奖励，工会应领导宣传，发挥全体职工积极性。
    第二，组织起来团结全体：在半年到一年内把合乎会员条件的职工，在自愿条件下都组织到工会中来。在解放初期曾犯过较严重的关门主义偏向，对“工会是工人阶级的群众性的组织”认识不明确。强调了会员政治条件，不恰当的强调了工人内部的复杂性，甚至有的超出会章，自定候补期，入会前先开训练班、坦白会、找保人等。到四月虽从干部思想上基本纠正过来，仍有关门主义残余，对某些表现落后，历史复杂和新来工人未及时吸收入会，吸收职员入会尤差，至今公营工厂尚有百分之三十以上职工尚在会外。私营企业已进行工作的，只是职工总数一小部分，没有大力组织起各种产业行业工会。工会活动还存在着形式主义毛病，没有解决本来能解决的实际问题，开会多，学习不切合要求，使某些人感到麻烦，以致有的工会威信不高。这次大会专门讨论了工会组织章程，合理的规定了入会条件，并规定按产业或行业性质，建立各种产业行业工会；要整理工会基础组织树立民主生活，坚持半年改选一次，将基层工会委员改为委员会，定期向会员报告；提拔大批干部，贯彻“大家办工会”的方针。
