　　The Failure of the Marshall Plan and American Agriculture
    By Labofu, translated by Fuying

    When President Truman welcomed the representatives to the last Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations meeting, he spoke extensively about the American Thanksgiving tradition, which began more than three centuries ago. He depicted the earliest colonists of America as people filled with compassion. President Truman told us that the earliest colonists—
    "Invited the Indians to join their celebration. Around the table of the first Thanksgiving feast, people forgot their differences, and enemies became friends. ..."
    This fabricated historical account allowed President Truman to boldly conclude, after announcing the "record-breaking" harvest of 1948:
    "The true spirit of our Thanksgiving is to share this harvest with others, to hold a warm friendship and goodwill towards others less fortunate than we. ..."
    The outcome of the hospitality shown by the earliest American colonists to the Indians is well known in America and throughout the world. Without comparing the present to the past, one can already foresee the future of "those less fortunate than us";—that is to say, the future of Western European countries lingering on the doorstep of the designers of the generously hospitable Marshall Plan is uncertain.
    The Marshall Plan has not benefited Western European countries but has instead enslaved them. This fact can no longer be debated. Attempts to portray the European Recovery Program as a noble act of self-sacrifice are becoming increasingly rare, even in America itself. All the exaggerated rhetoric about moral responsibility, Christian love, sacrifice, etc., has been replaced by vulgar and dirty prose. It wasn't long after Secretary of State Acheson said that the "driving objective" of the Marshall Plan "was not material" that the monopoly newspapers revealed with an impassioned tone:
    "It is at least recognized that Marshall Aid—as it is still called in Europe—is not given purely for charitable reasons, but with the purpose of stabilizing American production and helping American export trade." So wrote the "Northwestern Miller," the organ of the American flour mill capitalists, in May.
    However, not only is the "charitable" aid to Europe a deception, but so is the desired stability of the American economy. The signs of panic in every sector of the American economy are becoming increasingly evident. Even American newspapers can no longer ignore the panic in industry. But they still attempt to conceal the real situation in agriculture. In fact, every sector of American agriculture has experienced a very serious overproduction.
    Here, it is worthwhile to recall the sentiment expressed by the "Minneapolis Tribune" during the peak of the economic panic from 1929 to 1933 (which was more in tune with the times) to contrast with Truman's speech about record-breaking harvests. The "Minneapolis Tribune" said: those who used to pray for their daily bread are now praying that there won't be any bread. The newspaper said that this was equally abnormal theologically and economically.
    This abnormal situation in America's agricultural economy has become particularly serious since the last World War. In the years of widespread economic dislocation in Western Europe, the excessive and harmful development of American agricultural production is a prelude to panic. Now, both domestic and foreign markets are shrinking, leading to panic.
    The shrinking of the domestic market is due to the beginning of the American economic panic and the continued decline in people's living standards. The foreign market for American agriculture is also shrinking as countries importing agricultural products gradually—though very slowly—recover their agriculture, because there is a lack of a solid foundation for mutually beneficial trade between America and Western Europe.
    Anticipating that a large surplus of wheat would be unavoidable, the Washington authorities attempted to salvage the agricultural panic with various "regulatory" measures. For example, in 1947, a widespread campaign called for American agriculture to reduce wheat planting and switch to feed crops, tobacco, fruits, and vegetables. But in the following year, wheat, tobacco, fruits, and several other crops were all listed as surpluses because they could not be sold in large quantities to Marshallized countries.
    Therefore, the American rulers had to appeal to farmers to cut back on wheat production without telling them to switch to other crops to replace wheat. This appeal had no effect, so the government decided to adopt a system of controlling cultivated areas. Congress then passed the Agricultural Act in July 1948. The purpose of this act was to reduce the area sown to wheat in 1950 by 17 percent and greatly reduce loans to farmers secured by future harvests. The monopoly organizations that purchased farmers' agricultural products also artificially created a lack of storage capacity for agricultural products to reduce loans to farmers.
    This spring, the wheat situation clearly showed signs of transformation. The U.S. Department of Agriculture officially estimated that wheat stocks in 1950 would reach 13.6 million tons, an unprecedented record, 30 percent higher than the largest amount during the worst period of the panic from 1929 to 1933.
    A widespread campaign promoted the early shipment of large quantities of wheat to Europe under the Marshall Plan in an attempt to improve the situation on the wheat exchange. This attempt did not produce any results. The wheat exchange saw the large surplus in American wheat production and the reduced opportunities for American grain exports, so the response to all promises that the Marshall Plan would enable large quantities of wheat to be shipped to Europe was a continued decline in value. Even the announcement in July that the wheat harvest would be greatly reduced was met with a further drop in prices.
    It is now clear that the Marshall Plan has not eliminated the countless contradictions within the capitalist world but has instead sharpened them. This is true of the contradictions between America and the Marshallized countries, as well as the contradictions between the Western European countries participating in "European cooperation."
    The apparent intensification of the contradictions between America and other countries in the Western Hemisphere is particularly striking. One of the important things that the authors of the Marshall Plan wanted to accomplish was to consolidate American power in Canada, Argentina, and other parts of the Western Hemisphere. America spent money to enable these countries' agricultural products to be shipped to Western Europe, hoping to strengthen America's control over these countries' economic lives.
    Allocating a portion of the "aid" to Europe to purchase goods from Canada, Argentina, and other Latin American countries to ship to Europe was intended to stimulate these countries to increase their purchases in the United States. In this way, the problem of expanding American exports to countries in the Western Hemisphere—a problem that was extremely difficult to solve due to the lack of dollars—found a seemingly simple solution. At the same time, the dollars taken from American taxpayers' pockets to fund the Marshall Plan eventually flowed back into the coffers of American monopoly companies.
    But the increasing overproduction of American agriculture quickly overturned this clever plan. Dollar funding for Argentine grain exports never went beyond the promise stage. First, the Americans said that Argentina's prices were too high. But when the Argentine government agreed to lower its prices, Dr. Fitz Gerald, Director of the Food Division of the Economic Cooperation Administration, declared that although "the Argentine government has expressed its willingness to sell at competitive prices," the prospect of funding the purchase of grain in Argentina under the Marshall Plan was "not great" due to the expected large grain harvest in the United States.
    As a result, not a single dollar was used to purchase grain in Argentina for shipment to Marshallized countries.
    Canada has such close economic ties with the United States that the Economic Cooperation Administration, which implemented the Marshall Plan, initially could not find a reason to refuse to supply Canada with dollars for its wheat exports to Britain under the Anglo-Canadian Four-Year Agreement. Although the United States promised to provide some funds for these wheat exports, it severely restricted Canada's grain exports as a whole. For example, the Economic Cooperation Administration prohibited Canada from fulfilling Italy's order for Canadian oats because oats were listed as a surplus in the United States. Canada agreed with Italy to sell flour to Italy, but although the United States did not formally declare flour a surplus product, it was also prohibited by the United States. In April 1949, it was announced that Marshall Plan funding for Canadian wheat exports would cease as of March 1 (retroactively!). This meant that Britain had to take money from its meager dollar resources to pay for Canadian wheat. Britain paid 70 million U.S. dollars in cash, accounting for one-quarter of the total decrease in foreign exchange reserves in the Sterling Area from April 1 to June 30, 1949.
    Britain had no choice but to swallow this "Easter egg." (The London "Economist" called the American April announcement an "Easter egg.")
    "U.S. News & World Report" commented on a similar incident, saying:
    "The Economic Cooperation Administration's strategy is slightly fiercer than before. ... Washington's Economic Cooperation Administration is wielding the whip. The Western European countries that are being whipped are very indignant. But in order to obtain dollar aid, they have to swallow their anger.
    "Western European countries are beginning to realize that they have to endure many things put forward by the Economic Cooperation Administration's experts in Washington."
    The United States' decision to stop funding Canada's sale of wheat to Britain was not only to satisfy American wheat monopolists but also to deplete Britain's already dwindling hard currency reserves more quickly. However, this victory of the American grain monopolists over their foreign competitors indicates that the attempt to use the Marshall Plan to strengthen American imperialism's position in the countries of the Western Hemisphere has been declared a failure.
    As economic panic factors become increasingly prominent in the United States, American monopoly enterprises are also competing more fiercely for a piece of the Marshall Plan pie. When the House and Senate committees discussed the second year's funding for the Marshall Plan, 109 monopoly enterprises, even before the total amount of funding had been determined, were desperately trying to secure a larger share for themselves. The struggles between monopoly enterprises in similar sectors were particularly fierce. The struggle between wheat enterprises and flour monopoly companies was especially fierce.
    We must remember that the Foreign Assistance Act passed by Congress on April 3, 1948, stipulated that 25 percent of the wheat exported under the Marshall Plan had to be exported in the form of flour. This provision was added at the behest of American flour monopoly companies because the price of exported flour was much higher than the price of wheat plus milling costs, allowing them to make a fortune.
    Importing American flour was a serious blow to the flour industries of Western European countries. Western European countries worked so relentlessly to get rid of this additional burden that Marshall Plan executor Hoffman had to request a revision of the flour regulations. Wheat enterprises quickly seized this opportunity to get ahead of their flour industry counterparts: they argued for increasing wheat exports and decreasing flour exports on the grounds that with the current funding, wheat exports could sell more than overpriced flour exports.
    The enraged flour monopoly companies attempted to argue that this would only benefit Western Europe. "Northwestern Miller" said:
    "The current problem—protecting and extending the American flour export trade—is complex and cannot be solved by such a simple method as giving away our shirts so that European competitors can be shirtless faster."
    This organ of the American flour monopoly companies could not have portrayed the predatory nature of the American "aid" to Western Europe plan more vividly.
    The dispute between flour companies and wheat merchants was not resolved by the protests of European importers, nor even by the demands of American grain monopolists. The share of flour exports was indeed greatly reduced, but the factor that resolved this dispute was that American wheat stocks had increased to a dangerous level, necessitating the adoption of all measures, or rather remedial measures—because their remedial nature was very obvious.
    Economic panic is intensifying day by day. The Marshall Plan has proven its inability to prevent the development of economic panic, just as all attempts before it to "control" the chaos of the capitalist economy have failed.

　　马歇尔计划失败与美国农业
    拉波夫著  福英译
    杜鲁门总统在欢迎上次的联合国粮食农业组织会议的代表们时，讲了许多关于三百多年前创始的美国感恩节传统的话。把美国底最先殖民者描写成为充满着慈悲心的人们。杜鲁门总统告诉我们说，最先的殖民者——
    “邀请印第安人参加他们的庆祝。在第一度的感恩节的宴会棹子周围，人们忘却了他们之间的参商，敌人变成了朋友。……”
    这篇回忆历史的话是胡编出来的，使杜鲁门总统在宣布一九四八年的收成为“打破纪录的”之后能够下这么大胆的一个结论：
    “我们底感恩节底真精神是与他人分享这收成，是对其他的幸运不如我们的人抱着一种热烈友谊和好意的感情。……”
    美国底最先殖民者对于印第安人所表示的厚待，结果如何，在美国以及世界各处是众所熟知的。用不着将今比古，已可以知道“幸运不如我们的人们”底前途吉凶如何了；——这即是说，西欧诸国如果滞留在待客优厚的马歇尔计划设计者底门口阶石上，其前途吉凶，未卜可知。
    马歇尔计划对西欧诸国并没有什么好处，只是使其陷于奴役地位。这一事实已不能再争辩了。企图把欧洲复兴计划描写成为高尚的自我牺牲之举，甚至在美国本国，也已日益罕见。一切夸张的关于道义上的责任、基督教的爱、牺牲等等的空话，已换成卑污龌龊的散文了。国务卿艾奇逊说：马歇尔计划底“推动的目标”“不是物质的”，这句话没有讲多久。现在，独占报纸已露出激昂语气说道：
    “至少已认识到马歇尔援助——在欧洲大家仍然如此称呼它——并不是纯为慈善理由而给予，而是抱有稳定美国生产与帮助美国出口贸易之目的。”美国大面粉厂资本家底机关报—“西北面粉家”在五月份这样地写着。
    可是，不仅是对欧洲的“慈善的”援助，连所渴望的美国经济稳定，都成骗人的空话。美国经济每一部门底恐慌征候，日益明显。连美国报纸也已不能忽视工业中的恐慌了。但仍然企图掩蔽农业底实在情况。可是，事实上美国农业底每一部门都已发生很严重的生产过剩。
    在这里，值得我们回忆“明尼亚波利斯论坛报”在一九二九至三三年经济恐慌最高峰时所表现出来的情绪（该情绪是比较跟得上时代），来与杜鲁门论及打破纪录的收成的演说相对比。“明尼亚波利斯论坛报”说：那些惯于为他们每日得到吃的面包而祈祷的人们，现在祈祷不要有这面包了。这份报纸说，这在神学上和在经济学上同样是一件反常的事情。
    在美国底农业经济中的这种反常情形，自上次大战以来，变得特别严重。在西欧底广泛经济脱节底年头，美门农业生产底过度的和有害的发展，是恐慌的前奏。现在，不论是国内市场或国外市场，都日益缩小，因而发生恐慌了。
    国内市场底缩小，是归因于美国经济恐慌开始及人民生活程度继续下降。输入农业品的国家，其农业逐渐——虽然是很缓——恢复，美国农业国外市场也就跟着缩小，因为美国与西欧之间缺少进行互利的贸易之巩固基础。
    华盛顿当局预见小麦大量过剩将不能避免，企图以各种“管制的”措施来挽救农业恐慌。例如，在一九四七年，广泛宣传叫美国农业少种小麦，改种饲料作物、烟叶、水果、和蔬菜。但在下一年，小麦、烟叶、水果、和几种其他的农作物，都列于过剩物单中，因为它们不能大量地售给马歇尔化的诸国。
    所以，美国统治者不得不吁请农民削减小麦生产，而没有叫农民改种其他农作物以代替小麦。这种呼吁没有效果，政府因此决定采用管制耕种面积的制度。国会乃于一九四八年七月通过农业法案。该法案之目的，是要把一九五○年种小麦的面积减少百分之十七，并大大减少贷给农民的以未来的收成为抵押的贷款。收购农民底农作物的独占组织，也人工地造成农产品贮藏地位底缺乏，以削减对农民的贷款。
    今年春天，小麦情况显然已有转变兆征。美国农业部官方估计一九五○年小麦存货将达一千三百六十万吨，为空前的纪录，比一九二九至一九三三年恐慌底最坏时期的最大数量尚高出百分之三十。
    广泛地宣传按照马歇尔计划将早日运出大量的小麦至欧洲，企图以此改进小麦交易所底情形。这种企图并没有产生什么结果。小麦交易所看到美国小麦生产底大量过剩，美国谷物输出机会减少，故对于马歇尔计划将使小麦大量输往欧洲之一切诺言的反响，是价值继续不断下跌。甚至七月间宣布了小麦收成将大减的预言，交易所的反响也是价格再跌。
    现在已很清楚，马歇尔计划并没有消灭资本主义世界内部的无数的对立，实反使其更形尖锐。美国与马歇尔化的国家之间的对立是如此，参加“欧洲合作”的西欧各国之间的对立也是如此。
    美国与西半球其他国家之间的对立之显然加剧，特别著目。马歇尔计划底作者所欲完成的重要事情之一，就是巩固美国在加拿大、阿根廷、和西半球其他各地的势力。美国出钱使这些国家底农产品输往西欧，希望借此加强美国对这些国家底经济生活的控制。
    对欧洲的“援助”的拨款，拿出一部分来向加拿大、阿根廷、和其他拉丁美洲国家购买东西，运往欧洲，这是要刺激这些国家增加其在美国的购买。这样，扩大美国对西半球各国输出之问题——因美元缺乏，此一问题是极难解决的——找到了一个好象极简单的解决方法。同时，从美国纳税人底钱袋拿出来供给马歇尔计划的金元，最后又流回到美国独占公司底钱库中。
    但美国农业生产过剩日益增加，很快就推翻了这一巧妙计划。以美元资助阿根廷谷物输出，从没有越出诺言阶段而见诸实行。最先，美国人说阿根廷的价格太高。但当阿根廷政府同意降低其价目时，经济合作总署粮食部主任菲次泽刺德博士宣称，虽然“阿根廷政府表示愿意按竞争的价格售卖”，但由于预期美国将有大量的谷物收成，在马歇尔计划下出钱在阿根廷购买谷物之前途“并不大”。
    结果呢，没有一块钱用于在阿根廷购买谷物以输往马歇尔化的国家。
    加拿大与美国有如此密切的经济联系，执行马歇尔计划的经济合作总署最初找不出理由来拒绝以美元供给加拿大按照英加四年协定的对英的小麦输出。美国虽然应许用一些款项来供给这些小麦输出，但对加拿大底谷物输出整个限制得很严。例如，经济合作总署禁止加拿大履行意大利向加拿大定购燕麦的定单，因为燕麦在美国是列于过剩物单之内的。加拿大与意大利商定，把面粉卖给意大利，虽然美国没有正式宣布面粉为过剩品，也被美国禁止。在一九四九年四月宣布马歇尔计划拨款供给加拿大小麦输出，将自三月一日停止（追溯既往！）。这即是说，英国要从其微小的美元资源拿出钱来偿付加拿大小麦。英国付出现款七千万美元，占金镑地区从一九四九年四月一日至六月三十日外汇准备减少总数底四分之一。
    英国除了硬吞下这个“耶稣复活节蛋”之外，没有别的办法。（伦敦“经济学家周刊”称美国底四月宣告为“耶稣复活节蛋”。）
    “美国新闻与世界报导周刊”评论一同类的事件，说道：
    “经济合作总署底策略是比前稍凶了。……华盛顿经济合作总署大挥着鞭子。被鞭子打着的西欧诸国，十分愤慨。但为要获得美元援助，不得不忍气吞声。
    “西欧诸国开始认识到他们要忍受着华盛顿经济合作总署底专家们所提出的许多事情。”
    美国决定停止拨款供给加拿大卖给英国小麦，不仅是要满足美国小麦独占者，而且是要使英国底已经减少的硬币准备消耗得更快。但美国谷物独占者战胜其外国竞争者的这一胜利，是表示打算利用马歇尔计划以加强美帝国主义在西半球各国中的地位之企图已宣告失败。
    在美国的经济恐慌因素日益显著，美国独占企业也就日益剧烈地互争染指马歇尔计划底油水。当众议院和参议院委员会讨论马歇尔计划第二年拨款时，有一百零九个独占企业，甚至连拨款总额尚未决定，就在拼命想法为它们自己夺得较大的份儿。在相类部门中的诸独占企业之间的斗争，特别来得猛烈。小麦企业与面粉独占公司之间的争斗，尤其凶猛。
    我们要记得，国会在一九四八年四月三日所通过的外国援助法案，规定了在马歇尔计划下所输出的小麦，要有百分之二十五是以面粉底形态输出的。这一条文，是听命于美国面粉独占公司而加上去的。因为输出的面粉底价格，比小麦价格加上磨粉费还要高许多，使它们大发其财。
    输入美国面粉，对西欧各国底面粉工业是一个严重打击。西欧诸国是如此不屈不挠地努力想摆脱这一额外的负担，使得马歇尔计划执行人霍夫曼不得不请求修改关于面粉的规定。小麦企业赶快利用这个机会，比面粉工业的同伴们占先：他们主张增加小麦输出，减少面粉输出，理由是照目前的拨款，小麦输出能比价格卖得过高的面粉输出得多。
    激怒的面粉独占公司企图说明这只对西欧有好处。“西北面粉厂家”说：
    “目前的问题——保护和延长美国面粉输出贸易——是复杂的，而且不是用这么简单的方法，如象把我们的衬衫送掉使得欧洲的竞争者可以更快地不至无衬衫穿，所能解决的。”
    美国面粉独占公司底这份机关报，把美国“援助”西欧的计划底掠夺本质，描写得再活现也没有了。
    面粉公司与小麦商人之间的争执，不是由欧洲输入者底抗议解决之，甚至也不是由美国谷物独占者底要求解决之。面粉输出底份儿，在实际上是大大削减了，但解决此一争执的因素，是美国小麦存货已增至危险的程度，不得不采用一切的措施，或者不如说是弥补的措施——因为其弥补底性质是很显明的。
    经济恐慌，日甚一日。马歇尔计划已证明其不能阻止经济恐慌底发展，正如在它以前的一切想“控制”资本主义经济的混乱之企图都告失败一样。
