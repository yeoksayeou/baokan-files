　　Huada Trade Union Amateur School Opens
    Cheng Fangwu and Nie Zhen Speak
    Calling for Learning from Soviet Experiences and Cultivating a Large Number of Worker-Peasant Cadres
    [Our Newspaper] The North China University Amateur School, after active preparations by the trade union, held a grand opening ceremony at 7 pm on October 10. Four hundred trade union members were elated to be able to study culture. A cook said, "I haven't been to school in thirty years, and today I have the opportunity to study. This is all the happiness given by the Communist Party." The school administration also attached great importance to this work. Vice President Cheng Fangwu and Academic Dean Nie Zhen also took time out of their busy schedules to attend the meeting for guidance. Vice President Cheng emphasized in his speech: This school is actually a workers' supplementary school, which is a very important part of the cultural and educational policy in the Common Program of the People's Political Consultative Conference. The Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government will do everything possible to strengthen the workers' spare-time education, to open a large number of workers' supplementary schools and vocational schools, to help the working class and other laborers improve their culture, and to cultivate a large number of cadres from worker and peasant backgrounds. In his speech, Dean Nie introduced how the Soviet Union attached importance to the education of laborers after the victory of the revolution. Now the Soviet Union has cultivated many scientists, politicians, and thinkers from the working people. In the past, Chinese laborers had no culture because China was a country of landlords and the bourgeoisie; now that the Chinese revolution has been victorious, the working people have become the masters of the new China. We must learn from the Soviet Union to run spare-time schools well, so that everyone has a job and also has culture and theory. The speeches of Vice President Cheng and Dean Nie made people see a bright future and aroused a high level of enthusiasm for learning. The principal of the spare-time school is concurrently held by Bao Jianzhang, the director of the trade union, and the vice principal is concurrently held by Ma Naiguang, the director of the trade union's propaganda and education department. They and all the cadres of the spare-time school have meticulously formulated teaching plans and regular teaching systems. A textbook research group has also been formed by the teachers to study the teaching content. The students have also set up learning plans and will launch a learning competition.

　　华大工会业余学校开学
    成仿吾、聂真讲话
    号召学习苏联经验，培养大批工农干部
    【本报讯】华北大学业余补习学校，经过工会积极筹备于十月十日下午七时举行了隆重的开学典礼，四百个工会会员都因为自己能学习文化而兴高彩烈。一个炊事员说：“三十年没摸着上学，今天也有了学习的机会，这都是共产党给的幸福。”学校的行政也十分重视这一个工作，成仿吾副校长，聂真教务长也在百忙中抽出时间莅会指导。成副校长在讲话中强调指出：这个学校实际上是劳动者的补习学校，这是人民政协共同纲领中关于文化教育政策的很重要的一部分。中国共产党和人民政府要想尽办法加强劳动者的业余教育，开办大批的劳动者补习学校、专科学校，帮助工人阶级及其他劳动者提高文化，培养大量的工农出身的干部。聂教务长讲话中介绍了苏联革命胜利以后如何重视劳动者的教育，现在苏联已培养了许多劳动人民的科学家、政治家、思想家，我们中国劳动者过去没有文化是因为过去中国是地主资产阶级的国家；现在中国革命胜利了，劳动人民成了新中国的主人，我们要向苏联学习办好业余学校，使每一个人都有工作而且有文化，有理论。成副校长、聂教务长的讲话，使人们看见了光辉灿烂的远景，提起了高度的学习热情。业余学校的校长由工会主任鲍建章兼任，副校长由工会宣教部长马乃广兼任，他们和全体业余学校的干部缜密地制订了教学计划和正规的教学制度。并由教员组成教材研究组，研究教学内容。学员们也订出学习计划，将展开学习竞赛。
