The participation of the Soviet cultural, artistic, and scientific workers delegation headed by Fadeyev, Italian people's representative and member of the Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party, Sbarounis, and the Korean people's delegation, Vice-Chairman of the Korean National Committee for the Support of World Peace, Park Jung-ae, and Chairman of the Korean Vocational League, Choi Ho-min, who arrived during the conference, further enhanced the international significance of the conference and the warm atmosphere of international friendship and unity. When the Soviet delegation led by Fadeyev and Simonov, Sbarounis, and the Korean delegation entered the venue, the entire audience stood up and applauded warmly for a long time.
　　The conference venue was decorated in a solemn and simple manner. In the center of the rostrum hung Picasso's famous painting - a dove symbolizing world peace. Above the stage hung a large banner with the words "Defend People's Democracy, Safeguard Lasting World Peace," and opposite the rostrum hung a large horizontal banner with the words "People of the World Unite to Smash the Imperialist Policy of Aggression and the Conspiracy to Provoke War."
　　The congress began with a report by Qian Junrui, Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee of the China Peace Committee, followed by the enthusiastic adoption, amidst enthusiastic cheers from the venue, of Comrade Stalin, Chairman Mao Zedong, and Professor Curie, Chairman of the World Peace Congress, as honorary chairmen of the congress, and Song Qingling, Guo Moruo, Lin Boqu, and 102 others as the presidium, with Liu Ningyi, Huan Xiang, and Ding Zan as the secretary-generals and deputy secretary-generals.
　　Lin Boqu delivered the opening speech at the congress, stating: Today's congress demonstrates to the world that our newly born People's Republic of China is resolutely upholding world peace and resolutely opposing wars of aggression. He said: "The participation of the Soviet cultural, artistic, and scientific workers delegation, the representative of the Italian people, Sbarounis, and the Korean people's delegation indicates that our congress has closely merged with the international peace and democracy movement."
　　After pointing out the conspiracy of US imperialism to actively prepare for aggression against the Soviet Union, New China, and various new democratic countries, he said with fervor: "The Chinese people are by no means mere pacifists. When warmongers and imperialists force us to fight, the Chinese people, relying on the strength grown and developed from twenty-two years of military struggle, and the valuable experience gained from such a long struggle, will not hesitate to contend with them. The Chinese people are deeply convinced that they have full confidence in winning the final victory in the struggle against imperialism." (For the full text of the opening speech, see separate dispatch).

    大会会场布置庄严朴素，主席台正中悬挂着毕加索的名画——象征世界和平的鸽子，台上悬着“保卫人民民主维护世界持久和平”的大字标语，在主席台对面悬挂着“全世界人民联合起来粉碎帝国主义侵略的政策和挑拨战争的阴谋”的大字横幅标语。
    大会首由中国保卫世界和平大会筹备委员会总干事钱俊瑞报告，继即在会场热烈欢呼中通过以斯大林大元帅、毛泽东主席及世界保卫和平大会主席居里教授为大会名誉主席，宋庆龄、郭沫若、林伯渠等一百零五人为主席团，刘宁一、宦乡、丁瓒为正副秘书长。
    大会由林伯渠致开幕词，他说：今天的大会向世界表明了我们这个新诞生的中华人民共和国是坚决拥护世界和平，坚决反对侵略战争的。他说：“伟大的友邦苏联文化艺术科学工作者代表团、意大利人民的代表斯巴诺和朝鲜人民代表团的参加大会，指明了我们这个大会，已经和国际和平民主的运动密切地汇合起来了。”
    他在指出美帝国主义积极准备侵略苏联、新中国和各新民主国家的阴谋后，激昂地说：“中国人民决不是单纯的和平主义者。当战争贩子和帝国主义强迫我们作战时，中国人民凭着二十二年来从军事斗争中成长壮大起来的力量，以及从这样长期斗争中所得到的宝贵经验，将不惜与他们周旋。中国人民深信，有充分把握，可以在反对帝国主义的斗争中赢得最后的胜利。”（开幕词全文见另电）
