　　Taiyuan's Major Public Factories and Mines Exceeded Production Plans Last Month
    [This newspaper's dispatch] The fifteen major public light and heavy industrial factories and mines in Taiyuan City completed and exceeded their original production plans for September. The Iron and Steel Company's original plan for September was to refine 5,000 tons of coke, with quality requirements of no more than 20% ash content and no more than 8% powder content. However, thanks to the efforts of all employees and the result of machine repairs, the output increased to 5,472 tons, the ash content was reduced to 8.24%, and the powder content was reduced to 4%, greatly facilitating steelmaking and ironmaking. The original plan for iron smelting was 1,500 tons, but the actual output was 1,717.25 tons. The original plan for steelmaking was 1,500 tons, but the actual output was 1,673.61 tons. The original plan for rolling steel was 953 tons, but the actual rolled steel was 1,226.57 tons. Other by-products such as gasoline, naphtha, and asphalt also exceeded the plan. All employees of the Coal and Iron Company worked hard to produce under the slogan of "increasing wages without increasing factory costs." The amount of coal mined increased from 0.861 tons per person per day in August to 1.073 tons in September. The original production plan for the mine in September was 29,205 tons. Due to the overproduction of each employee, the total production was 30,976.09 tons. The production of oxygen and other products by the Industrial Chemical Company has reached the highest level during the Japanese and Yan [Xishan]'s rule, and it has also created a new record in raw material conservation. After the Textile Company repaired the machines dismantled by the Yan bandits in September, the yarn spun increased from 501,233 pounds in August to 790,472 pounds, and the cloth woven also increased from 9,371 bolts in August to 17,080 bolts. The Leather Factory focused on producing machine belts. The original plan was to produce 30,000 single-inch feet, but the actual output was 35,443.5 single-inch feet, exceeding the plan by 15%. There are three main reasons for completing the production plan: First, the production plan was formulated from individuals, groups, and classes to the entire factory. This inspired the workers' sense of ownership and initiative, so that the output, quality, and use of materials were generally close to rationalization. Second, a production competition movement was launched. Third, the Party, government, and labor union closely cooperated. After the production plans of coal mines, chemical plants, and other factories were determined, the Party, the Communist Youth League, and the labor union mobilized Party members, League members, and activists to take the lead, promote intermediate elements, and drive backward elements to ensure the completion of the plan. At the same time, the factory established a strict attendance system, ensuring the completion of production tasks from the perspective of strength organization.

　　太原主要公营厂矿上月生产超过计划
    【本报讯】太原市十五个主要公营轻重工业厂矿，九月份完成并超过了原订生产计划。钢铁公司九月份原计划炼焦五千吨，在质量上要求灰分不超过百分之二十，粉末不超过百分之八，但由于全体职工的努力，及改修机器的结果，产量提高到五、四七二吨，灰分减少到百分之八·二四，粉末减少到百分之四，大大便利了炼钢炼铁。炼铁原计划一、五○○吨，实产一、七一七·二五吨。炼钢原计划一、五○○吨，实产一、六七三·六一吨。碾钢原计划九五三吨，实碾一、二二六·五七吨。其他如汽油、那夫撒林、沥青等副产品，也都超过了计划。煤铁公司全体职工，在“增加工资不增加工厂成本”的口号下努力生产，采煤量由八月份每人每天○·八六一吨，增至九月份的一·○七三吨。该矿九月份生产计划原为二九、二○五吨，由于每个职工超产的结果，共产三○、九七六·○九吨。工业化学公司氧气等生产，已达日、阎统治时期的最高额，并在原料节约上创造了新纪录。纺织公司在九月份将阎匪拆散的机器进行修整后，纺纱已由八月份五○一、二三三磅增至七九○、四七二磅，织布亦由八月份的九、三七一匹增至一七、○八○匹。皮革厂着重生产了机器轮带，原计划生产三万单英寸英尺，实产三五四四三·五单英寸英尺，超出计划百分之十五。完成生产计划的主要原因有三：一、生产计划的制订，是从个人、小组、课订起，以至全厂，这样启发了工人的主人翁思想与积极性，因而使产量、质量、使用工料一般都接近了合理化。二、发动了生产竞赛运动。三、党政工密切配合。煤矿、化学等厂，在生产计划确定后，党、工、团都通过组织，动员党团员及工会会员积极分子带头，推动中间分子，带动落后分子，保证计划完成。厂方同时建立了严格考勤制，从力量组织上，保证了完成生产任务。
