    The Object of Study, Tasks, and Characteristics of Political Economy
    　　　　Chapter 1: Mode of Production
    　　　　Section 1: Productive Forces
    Humans rely on their own purposeful labor to transform nature, enabling nature to provide humans with material necessities.
    Animals and plants in the natural world also undergo changes, but these changes are small and do not suit human purposes and requirements. Humans transform nature according to their own purposes and intentions, making nature suitable for human needs. Since the beginning of human history, humans have used their own power to transform nature and make it serve humanity. Human survival depends on production, and production fundamentally involves a relationship with nature, that is, a struggle with nature. Humans apply labor power to nature, or use labor power to process nature, changing its form, position, and properties. As a result, nature provides people with certain material necessities. For example, planting trees and forests, mining coal, and fishing are all ways in which people process nature, resulting in fruits, timber, coal, and fish. This activity of humankind, this use of labor power, is labor. However, this human labor differs from the activities of other animals; it is purposeful and conscious labor. Therefore, Marx said: "Labor is, in the first place, a process in which both man and Nature participate, and in which man of his own accord starts, regulates, and controls the material re-actions between himself and Nature." He also said: "We are not now dealing with those primitive instinctive forms of labour that resemble the merely animal. We pre-suppose labour in a form that stamps it as exclusively human. A spider conducts operations that resemble those of a weaver, and a bee puts to shame many an architect in the construction of her cells. But what distinguishes the worst of architects from the best of bees, is this, that the architect raises his structure in imagination before he erects it in reality. At the end of every labour-process, we get a result that already existed in the imagination of the labourer at its commencement. He not only effects a change of form in the material on which he works, but he also realises a purpose of his own that gives the law to his modus operandi, and to which he must subordinate his will." (Marx, Capital, Volume One, Part III, Chapter 5). Thus, nature can only provide humans with material necessities when humans consciously and purposefully use their labor power, that is, by relying on purposeful human labor.
    Natural forces must be transformed into the productive force of labor through human labor.
    Nature provides us with basic material necessities, such as the animals, plants, and minerals we need, which are originally produced or exist naturally in nature. However, natural objects produced by nature, or natural substances that exist naturally, must be processed by human labor in order to become human property and useful to humans. Therefore, nature must be processed by human labor under certain conditions, that is, when humans interact with nature, in order to become useful to humans, that is, to become the productive force of labor and nature. Therefore, William Petty said, "Labour is the father and active principle of wealth, as lands are the mother," but parents must come together to produce children.
    Labor objects have two parts and their impact on productive forces.
    The object of labor is everything that labor can process, such as land, rivers, mines, and so on. Some of these exist naturally or are directly supplied by nature, while others have been modified by labor or have undergone labor processing. Labor objects that have been processed or filtered by human labor are called raw materials, including auxiliary materials. Therefore, Marx said: "All raw material is an object of labour, but not every object of labour is raw material," because "an object of labour must already be modified by labour before it can function as raw material." (Capital, Volume One, Part III, Chapter 5). The object of labor is one of the essential basic elements of production, as well as an indispensable basic element in the composition and development of productive forces. In agriculture and industrial mining, production cannot proceed without the object of labor. It's like the stage play "Brother and Sister Reclaiming Wasteland," where there is labor power and means of labor, but without an object of labor, no results can be achieved. In industry, if there is no object of labor, machines cannot operate. In mining, if there are no mineral deposits, labor is fruitless. In addition, forestry, animal husbandry, and fisheries cannot proceed without an object of labor.
    These raw materials and auxiliary materials include, in industry, raw materials such as iron for machine manufacturing and cotton for spinning, as well as auxiliary materials such as oil for wheels and fuel for power engines. In agriculture, they are called seeds, such as seeds for grains, vegetables, trees, and flowers. In animal husbandry, there are breeding bulls, stallions, and stud donkeys. The quantity and quality of raw materials and auxiliary materials have a significant impact on production and productive forces. If they are absent, production cannot proceed. If their quantity is insufficient, production will also be inadequate, and productive forces will be lower or inferior. The quality of raw materials and auxiliary materials also affects the outcome of production. High-quality raw materials and auxiliary materials result in better products, reflecting higher productive forces, while poor-quality raw materials and auxiliary materials result in poorer products, reflecting lower productive forces. For example, in agriculture, the yield and quality of wheat, rice, millet, and corn planted with improved seeds are higher. In animal husbandry, calves, foals, and donkey foals bred from excellent breeding bulls, stallions, and stud donkeys are stronger and healthier. In industry, raw materials and auxiliary materials are also subject to similar requirements. Good-quality cotton produces more and better yarn, and good yarn also improves the efficiency of weaving (it is stronger, produces less waste, and weaves smoothly; of course, technical skill also plays a role). The quality of fuel (such as coal, gasoline, and diesel) has different effects on productive forces; good coal and good oil-based fuels produce greater power, while poor-quality fuel produces less. Therefore, the quantity and quality of raw materials and auxiliary materials have different effects on production and productive forces. To improve production and increase productive forces, in addition to the necessary natural conditions, we must also select, process, eliminate, and improve raw materials and auxiliary materials, choosing the good and discarding the bad. As for how to do this specifically, that falls within the scope of natural science research and is the responsibility of natural scientists; it is no longer the scope and task of political economy.
    In short, the object of labor is divided into two parts: one part is natural or supplied by nature, and the other part is obtained from nature through human labor, or raw materials and auxiliary materials that have been processed and manufactured from nature through human labor. These two parts form the object of labor. In primitive times, nature or natural objects were the objects of human labor, and this will not change as long as humanity continues to exist and develop. However, with the development of human society and the increase of productive forces, the things that nature acquires through labor and becomes processed and manufactured into objects of labor are increasing day by day and will continue to increase in the future. This is the result of production and the development of productive forces, as well as the manifestation of production and the development of productive forces.
    The Meaning of Means of Labor
    Above, we have only discussed one part of the elements that constitute productive forces, namely the object of labor. In addition to this, the elements that constitute productive forces also include the means of labor (that is, the means of labor in the narrow sense, also called labor tools or labor materials, while the means of labor in the broad sense has the same meaning as the means of production). In terms of content, the means of labor are tools, machines, and the like. When humans engage in labor, that is, when they apply labor to the object of labor, generally speaking, humans cannot perform labor barehanded, but must transmit labor to the object of labor through the means of labor in order to perform labor. Marx made it clear: The means of labour is "a thing, or a complex of things, which the labourer interposes between himself and the subject of his labour, and which serves as the conductor of his activity directed on that subject. ... He makes use of the mechanical, physical, and chemical properties of some substances in order to make other substances subservient to his aims." (Marx, ibid.).

　　政治经济学教程绪论（３）

    政治经济学的研究对象任务及其特点
    　　　　第一章　生产方式
    　　　　第一节　生产力
    人类依靠自身的合目的性劳动改造自然使自然供给人类以物质生活资料
    自然界中的动植物，它本身也有变化，但变化不大，并且不能适合人类的目的要求。人类改造自然，是可以依据人类自己的目的意图使自然适合于人类的要求。自从有人类历史以来，人类就是这样用自己的力量来改造自然，使自然为人类服务的。人类的生存依靠生产，而生产基本地先要和自然发生关系，也就是要和自然进行斗争。人以劳动力加于自然，或使用劳动力加工于自然改变它的形态、位置、以及它的性质等等。其结果，自然就供给人以一定的物质生活资料。例如：人们植树造林、开矿挖煤、下水捉鱼，都是人们加工于自然，其结果使人们获得果实木材，得到煤炭，捕获鱼类。人类的这种活动，这种劳动力的使用，就是劳动。但这种人类的劳动不同于其他动物的活动，它是有目的意识的劳动，也就是合目的性的劳动。所以马克思说：“劳动最先是人与自然间的一个过程，在这过程中，人由他自己的活动，以媒介、以规划、并且以统制人与自然之间的物质变换。”又说：“劳动过程终结时所得的成果，已经在劳动过程的开始时，观念地存在于劳动者的表象中，他不仅引起自然物的形态变化，同时还在自然物中实现他的目的，他知道他的目的，并以这个目的当作规律来规定他行动的方法样式，并使自己的意志从属于这个目的。”（马克思：资本论第一卷第三篇第五章）由此可见；自然之所以能供给人类以物质生活资料，必须是以人类有意识有目的的使用自己的劳动力作代价的，即依靠人类合目的性的劳动获得来的。
    自然力必须经过人类的劳动才能成为劳动之自然的生产力
    自然供给我们以基本的物质生活资料，例如：我们所需要的动、植、矿物原来都是自然产生出来或者是自然存在的自然物质。但是自然产生出来的自然物，或自然存在的自然物质，必须经过人类的劳动，才能够成为人类的东西，才能够变为对人类的有用物。因此，自然必须是在一定的条件下，由人类劳动加工于自然上，即人与自然发生关系的时候，才能成为对人类有用的东西，即成为劳动之自然的生产力。因此，威廉配第说过：“劳动是物质财富之父，土地是其母”，但是，父母必须结合起来才能生产出孩子来。
    劳动对象有两部份及其对生产力的影响
    劳动对象，就是劳动所能加工的一切对象，如土地、河流、矿山等等。它有自然存在或自然直接供给的，也有经劳动改造过的或曾经劳动滤过的劳动对象。经人类劳动加工改造过或曾经劳动滤过劳动对象，则叫做原料，包括辅助材料在内。故马克思说：“一切原料是劳动对象，但不是一切劳动对象都是原料”，因为“劳动对象，必须已由劳动引起变化，方才成为原料”。（资本论第一卷第三篇第五章）劳动对象是生产所不可缺少的基本要素之一，也是生产力构成与发展的必不可缺少的一个基本要素。在农业和工矿业等生产中，如果没有劳动对象，生产就无法进行，好象舞台上演出的“兄妹开荒”，有劳动力，也有劳动手段，但是没有劳动对象，是开不出结果来的。在工业中如无劳动对象，则机器无法开动，在矿业中如果没有矿藏，只是劳而无功。此外，如林业、牧畜、渔业等等，如果没有劳动对象，是无法进行生产的。
    这些原料与辅助材料，在工业方面如机器制造业的铁，纺纱业的棉花等原料，车轮用的油类、动力机的燃料等辅助材料，农业方面则叫做种籽，即如五谷杂粮的种籽，菜籽、树木花卉的各种种籽是，畜牧方面则有种牛、种马、种驴等等。原料和辅助材料它们数量的多寡，质量的好坏，对于生产和生产力都有很大的影响，如果没有它们生产就无法进行，既如上述，如果它们的数量少了，生产也要感到不足，生产力也就要低落或者差些。他们质量的好坏，生产的结果也不同，原料辅助材料质量好的，生产出来的生产物就好，表现生产力也高，质量差的，生产的结果就差，表现生产力也差。例如农业中小麦、稻米、小米、玉茭用改良种籽种植的收获量大，质量也好。畜牧业中优良的种牛、种马、种驴交配出来的牛犊、马驹、驴驹就壮健。工业中的原料辅助材料，也是一样讲究，优良品种的棉花纺出来的纱就多而且好，好线织布的效率也好（坚实，废料少，并且织的也顺利，当然技术好坏也有关系）。燃料（如煤炭、汽油、柴油等）品质的好坏，对生产力都有不同的影响，如好的煤，好的油类燃料，所发挥的力量就大，反之，则弱。因之，原料、辅助材料，其数量的多寡，质量好坏，对生产和生产力都有不同的影响。所以我们要把生产搞好，要把生产力提高，除了必须具备的自然条件以外，对原料、辅助材料也都必须加以选择，加工、淘汰，改良，选好的，去坏的。至于具体怎样做，那是属于自然科学的研究范围，是自然科学家的事情，已不是政治经济学研究的范围和任务了。
    总之，劳动对象分为两部分，一部份是自然或自然供给的，一部分是经人类劳动由自然获得来的，或者经过人类劳动对自然加工制造出来的原料和辅助材料，这两部份形成劳动对象。在原始时代，自然或自然物就是人类的劳动对象，并且任何时代人类要继续存在发展下去，自然是人类的劳动对象这一点是不会发生变化的。但随着人类社会的发展，生产力的提高，自然经过劳动获得经过加工制造而成为劳动对象的东西，就一天一天的增多起来，以后还要继续不断地增加起来，这是生产与生产力发展的结果，也是生产与生产力发展的表现。
    劳动手段的意义
    以上我们只说到构成生产力要素的一个部分，即劳动对象的部分。除此以外，构成生产力要素的还有劳动手段（即狭义的劳动手段也叫做劳动工具，又叫做劳动资料，广义的劳动手段与生产手段一样意思）。劳动手段，就其内容说来，就是工具、机器一类东西。当人类要从事劳动，即把劳动加到劳动对象上去的时候，一般说来，人类是不能赤手空拳地来进行劳动的，而是要通过劳动手段把劳动传导到劳动对象上去，才能够进行劳动的。马克思说得很明白：劳动手段，是“劳动者把它插在他自身和劳动对象之间，把它用作传导自己的活动到对象上去的传导体。……他利用诸物之力学的、物理的、和化学的诸属性，把它们当做权力手段，加力于物上，使物适应于自己的目的。”（马克思：上揭书）
