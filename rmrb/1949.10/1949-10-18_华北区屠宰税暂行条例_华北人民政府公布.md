    Article 1: A slaughter tax shall be levied locally in accordance with these Regulations on pigs, sheep, cattle, horses, mules, donkeys, camels, and other livestock slaughtered for profit within this Region. Those who slaughter for their own consumption shall be exempt from the tax. Those who slaughter for their own consumption but sell a portion shall still pay tax on the portion sold in accordance with the regulations.
    
    Article 2: The slaughter tax rate shall be 10 percent, calculated ad valorem according to the standard. The standard weights are specified as follows:
    
    1.  Pigs: 80 catties per head
    2.  Wool sheep: 25 catties per head; goats: 15 catties per head (in the provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan, both wool and goats are calculated at 25 catties per head)

    Article 4: Before slaughtering livestock, it is necessary to report to the local tax authority for inspection and pay taxes. The collecting authority shall issue a tax payment certificate and affix an inspection stamp on the meat before it can be sold; otherwise, it will be treated as illegal slaughter. If it is found to be unsanitary after inspection, no tax will be levied, and the sale will be prohibited. Those who slaughter for their own consumption must have a certificate from the local street (village) government to be exempt from tax.
    
    Article 5: It is strictly forbidden to slaughter draft animals (including transport livestock), breeding stock, and pregnant animals. Those that are old, weak, or disabled must be reported to the local tax authority for inspection and approval before they can be slaughtered.
    
    Article 6: In order to protect urban sanitation, slaughterhouses may be established in larger cities, with special personnel assigned to manage tax collection. Those slaughtering livestock shall slaughter at the slaughterhouse. (Muslims may be allowed to set up separate slaughterhouses). The management measures for slaughterhouses shall be specifically stipulated by the provincial (municipal) tax bureau.
    
    Article 7: All meat shops, meat restaurants, and restaurants, etc., that exclusively or concurrently engage in the slaughtering business must apply for registration with the local tax authority before opening for business.
    
    Article 8: Those who violate any of the following provisions shall be subject to penalties:
    
    1.  Those who fail to apply for registration as required shall be fined 2,000 to 20,000 yuan.
    2.  Those who slaughter privately or transport and sell untaxed meat shall, in addition to paying the tax in accordance with the regulations, be fined one to five times the amount of tax evaded.
    3.  Those who forge tax certificates and stamps, or privately slaughter draft animals, breeding stock, or pregnant animals, or cause livestock to become disabled for slaughter, shall be handed over to the judicial organs for punishment.
    
    Article 9: Anyone may report the illegal acts mentioned in the preceding article. After verification, 30 percent of the fines and confiscated amounts shall be awarded. The distribution method shall be determined separately.
    
    Article 10: After the promulgation of these Regulations, all local single tax regulations related to slaughter shall be abolished.
    
    Article 11: These Regulations shall come into effect from the date of promulgation.
