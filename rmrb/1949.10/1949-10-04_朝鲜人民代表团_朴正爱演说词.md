Speech by Park Chung-ae of the Korean People's Delegation

Respected Ladies and Gentlemen:

On behalf of the 30 million Korean people who are striving for world peace and for the unification and independence of their motherland, I extend my brotherly congratulations to all of you who are participating in the inaugural meeting of the Chinese People's Congress for the Defense of World Peace.

At the same time, I pay my highest respects to the heroic Chinese people who, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the great people's leader Mao Zedong, have overthrown the Kuomintang reactionaries of Chiang Kai-shek, who are strongly supported by U.S. imperialism, and established the new Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China.

The great victory won by the heroic Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party and the great leader of the people, Mao Zedong, has strengthened the confidence of the progressive mankind of the whole world who are against the new aggressive war of imperialism, and has given a very strong and decisive force to the progressive mankind of the whole world.

This great victory of the Chinese people has inspired the oppressed nations of the Far East and the world to move towards victory, and will be a powerful guarantee for the speedy demise of the reactionary rulers of the United States, the peddlers of new aggressive wars.

The Korean people, who stood with the Chinese people in the past to fight heroically against Japanese imperialism, and who are still fighting today against the mad aggression of U.S. imperialism, express special joy at the great victory of the Chinese people.

On behalf of the Korean people, it is a supreme honor to come to the new China, which has just announced the People's Republic, and it is even more glorious to be able to introduce to you the struggle of the Korean people for peace and independence.

The Fatherland Democratic United Front, which unites all patriotic and democratic forces in Korea, has issued its declaration, which proposes: "To withdraw the U.S. imperialist aggressor troops and the so-called 'UN Korea Committee' from the territory of our motherland, and to strive for peaceful reunification." However, the Lee Seung-man puppet "government," the running dog of U.S. imperialism, under the instruction of its master, not only rejected the proposal of the Fatherland Unification Democratic Front, which truly represents the will of the entire Korean people, but also intensified its efforts to prosecute and kill many patriotic people in the southern half of the Republic. They sent their so-called "national defense forces" and "guards" assassination squads to invade the northern half of the Republic in an attempt to provoke a fratricidal civil war, but their attempts were each time thwarted by the Republic's brave security forces and failed.

Under the leadership of the wise leader of the Korean people, General Kim Il-sung, the achievements of democratic construction won by the people in the northern half of Korea have given great encouragement to the people in the southern half of the Republic who are fighting against the oppression of U.S. imperialism and the Lee Seung-man puppet government. Therefore, it is inevitable that the vast number of soldiers of the so-called "national defense forces" and the "fleet," etc., in South Korea will revolt and run to the embrace of the people. The people of South Korea, who are unwilling to be slaves, have automatically joined the guerrillas and are attacking the puppet troops equipped with American weapons everywhere. I think that, just as all the aggressions of U.S. imperialism have been driven out under the tenacious struggle of the heroic Chinese people, all the aggressions of U.S. imperialism in Korea will soon be completely driven out.

This is the glorious link in the struggle of the Korean people to defend world peace and democracy against the peddlers of new wars for the progressive mankind of the world. I believe that in this struggle, the friendship between the Korean and Chinese people will be further consolidated. Ladies and gentlemen, at the forefront of our ranks to defend world peace and democracy and oppose the peddlers of new wars is the peace fortress, the Soviet Union. The world peace and democracy camp headed by the great Soviet Union is undoubtedly bound to win.

Long live the Chinese People's Congress for the Defense of World Peace!

Long live the fighting Chinese people under the leadership of Mao Zedong!

Long live lasting world peace!

Long live the eternal friendship between the Korean and Chinese people!

Long live the liberator of the world's weak and small nations and their close friend, the great Stalin!

　　朝鲜人民代表团
   　朴正爱演说词
    【新华社北京三日电】朝鲜人民代表团朴正爱在中国保卫世界和平大会上的演说词全文如下：敬爱的诸位先生：
    我代表争取世界和平并为实现祖国的统一、独立而斗争的三千万朝鲜人民，向参加中国保卫世界和平大会成立大会的诸位致兄弟的祝贺。
    同时，我向打倒为美帝国主义所极力支持的蒋介石国民党反动派，而建立了新中华人民共和国中央人民政府的英勇的中国人民致崇高的敬礼。
    英勇的中国人民在共产党和伟大的人民领袖毛泽东的领导之下，获得了辉煌胜利。这对于反对帝国主义新侵略战争的全世界的进步人类，加强了胜利的信心，并给了全世界进步人类非常强大的决定性的力量。
    中国人民的这一伟大的胜利鼓舞了远东及全世界被压迫民族走向胜利，并将成为促成美国反动的统治者、新侵略战争贩子迅速灭亡的有力的保障。
    过去和中国人民站在一起反对日本帝国主义作英勇的斗争，而在今天还对美帝国主义的疯狂侵略进行斗争的朝鲜人民，对于中国人民的伟大胜利表示特别的欢欣。
    我代表朝鲜人民来到刚刚宣布人民共和国的新中国是无上的光荣，而且向诸位能够介绍朝鲜人民的争取和平与独立的斗争更为光荣。
    团结了朝鲜的一切爱国民主力量所组成的祖国民主主义统一战线，已经发布了它的宣言，宣言中提出了：“使美帝国主义侵略军队及所谓‘联大朝鲜委员团’撤出我们祖国的领土，并争取和平统一”。但是，美帝国主义的走狗李承晚傀儡“政府”受其主子的指示，不但拒绝了真正代表全朝鲜人民意志的祖国统一民主主义战线的提议，反而在共和国南半部变本加厉地检举并杀害了许多爱国人民。他们使他们的所谓“国防军”“警卫队”暗杀团等侵入共和国北半部，企图挑拨同族之间互相残杀的国内战争，可是，他们的企图每一次都被共和国的勇敢的警备队所阻止而失败了。
    在朝鲜人民的英明领袖金日成将军领导之下，朝鲜北半部的人民所争取了的民主建设成果是给与了反对美帝国主义和李承晚傀儡政府压迫而斗争的共和国南半部人民的莫大的鼓励，因此南朝鲜所谓“国防军的广大士兵”以及“舰艇队”等起义而跑到人民的怀抱里来，是很必然的事。南朝鲜的不愿做奴隶的人民，自动参加了游击队，到处打击为美式武器所装备的傀儡军队。我想，如同美帝国主义的一切侵略在英勇的中国人民的顽强斗争之下所被驱逐一样，在朝鲜，美帝国主义的一切侵略不久就要被完全驱逐出去。
    这就是朝鲜人民担负全世界进步人类保卫世界和平民主斗争中的光荣的一环。我相信，在这一斗争当中，朝鲜和中国两国人民的友谊将更加巩固。诸位先生们，保卫世界和平民主、反对新战争贩子的我们的队伍在最前面就是和平堡垒苏联。以伟大的苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营是毫无疑义地一定胜利。
    中国保卫世界和平大会万岁！
    毛泽东领导下战斗的中国人民万岁！
    世界持久和平万岁！
    朝中人民永久友谊万岁！
    全世界弱小民族的解放者和其亲近的朋友伟大的斯大林万岁！
