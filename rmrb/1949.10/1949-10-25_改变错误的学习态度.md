　　Changing Erroneous Learning Attitudes
    Wang Yi
    Since the basic victory of the Liberation War, the broad masses of intellectuals have flocked to revolutionary schools, demanding to transform themselves in order to participate in revolutionary work. They are all humbly studying Marxist-Leninist theory and establishing a new outlook on life. However, there are still a small number of students among them who, although also studying, confuse their understanding of revolutionary schools with that of old schools. They only want to learn a set of Marxist-Leninist theories, preparing to go out and do some leadership work in the future. They believe that being grouped together with people of varying levels of education, collective discussions, and taking on work during the study period only delays learning time.

    Among them, some with higher levels of education always think they are superior to others in the group and cannot learn anything from others. Students with lower levels of education feel that they know less and are always inferior to others in discussions, so they dare not speak. As a result, they feel that group meetings are a burden. Those who take on work during the study (group leaders or club committee members, etc.) feel that their reading time has been shortened and feel that the work they are doing is a burden.

    The erroneous thinking of these students lies in the fact that they have not clarified the difference between new and old learning. They think that learning is simply reading books, and that all activities other than reading will hinder learning. They have not noticed that daily life is a good object for their own learning, a laboratory for combining theory with practice. They do not understand that collective learning can allow them to learn from each other's strengths and make up for their weaknesses. If they do not pay attention to these things and treat our school the same way as old schools in the past, then they are fundamentally wrong.

    Therefore, students who are required to transform themselves should realize that school life itself is learning, and taking on some work even increases learning opportunities. But how to use it? We use it to gain more practical opportunities in the work we participate in. If we hold on to the old learning views and learning methods, theory and practice will never be connected, and we will inevitably fail to do a good job in the future. Therefore, if this kind of erroneous view of learning is not corrected in time, it will not be beneficial to anyone, whether to others or to oneself.

　　改变错误的学习态度
    王仪
    自从解放战争基本得到胜利以后，广大的知识分子，都纷纷投入革命学校，要求改造自己，以便参加革命工作。他们都很虚心地学习马列主义理论，建立新的人生观。可是其中还有一小部分同学虽然也在学习，但他们都对革命学校的认识和旧学校混淆起来，只想自己能学一套马列主义的理论，准备将来出去做些领导工作，而对文化程度高低不齐编在一起、集体讨论、学习期间担任工作等，认为只是耽误学习的时间。
    在他们中，一些文化程度较高的，在小组内总以为自己比别人高一头，向别人学不到什么；文化程度低的同学，则觉着自己知道的东西少，在讨论会上处处不如人家，便不敢发言了，这样，对小组会便感到是个负担；在学习中担任工作的（小组长或俱乐部委员等），自己认为缩短了看书时间，对所担任的工作便觉着是个负担。
    这些同学的错误想法，就在于他们对新旧学习的认识上没有弄清楚，以为学习就是单纯的读书，读书以外的一切活动，都会防碍学习。他们没有注意到日常生活正是自己学习的好对象，正是理论与实际结合的试验室，不明白集体学习，可以彼此去长补短，假使没有注意到这些，把我们的学校和以往的旧学校同样看待，那就根本错了。
    所以要求改造的同学，应当注意到学校生活本身就是学习，担任一点工作那更是增加了学习机会。但怎样运用呢？我们便用在自己参加的工作中，得到更多的实践机会。如果，抱着旧的学习观点、学习方法，理论与实际始终无法联系，将来也必做不好工作，所以这种对学习的错误观点，如不及时纠正，不论对人对己，都是没有好处的。
