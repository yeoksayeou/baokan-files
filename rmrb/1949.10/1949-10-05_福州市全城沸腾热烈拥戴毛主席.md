Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 2nd. When the good news of the founding of the Central People's Government arrived, this provincial capital on the southeast coast erupted. On the evening of the 30th of last month, when the Beijing Xinhua Broadcasting Station reported the list of Chairman Mao Zedong and six Vice Chairmen, including Zhu De, Liu Shaoqi, and Soong Ching Ling, propaganda teams immediately spread the joyous news throughout the city, causing applause and cheers to erupt throughout the streets. On the morning of the 1st, many people came to the Fujian Daily distribution office, waiting to buy newspapers. The people of the city expressed their lofty respect and warm support for Chairman Mao Zedong and the Central People's Government. The workers of the Pingshui Three Steamboat Company in the lower reaches of the Min River unanimously expressed their desire to learn from the spirit of the railway workers in North China and Shanghai, who built railways wherever the People's Liberation Army (PLA) advanced. Wherever the PLA crosses the sea, our ships will sail there to support the front lines and consolidate the People's Republic. Zheng Huang, the manager of the Weiguang Trading Company, who had just returned from Rangoon, believed that the fact that the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) had sixteen overseas Chinese representatives and the Central People's Government had two overseas Chinese committee members meant that overseas Chinese were gaining political status for the first time under the leadership of Chairman Mao. He hoped that the overseas Chinese representatives would fully publicize the CPPCC meeting to the overseas Chinese after returning abroad, so that every overseas Chinese would rise up to assist in building a new China. Other people in industry and commerce expressed their support for the fact that sixteen of the thirty ministries, commissions, administrations, and banks under the People's Government belonged to economic construction departments. They believed that this was a concrete manifestation of the Central People's Government's emphasis on developing production and prospering the economy. The future of national industry and commerce is extremely bright. People from all walks of life advocated taking practical actions to support Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government.

　　福州市全城沸腾热烈拥戴毛主席
    【新华社福州二日电】当中央人民政府宣告成立的喜讯传来后，这个东南沿海的省城沸腾了。上月三十日晚上，北京新华广播电台报告毛泽东主席及朱德、刘少奇、宋庆龄等六位副主席的当选名单时，宣传队立即把这喜讯带到全市各处去，引起了满街的鼓掌和欢呼。一日清晨，就有许多人来到福建日报发行部门口，等着买报。全市人民对毛泽东主席和中央人民政府表示出崇高的敬意和热烈的拥戴。闽江下游平水三个轮船公司的职工，一致表示要学习华北和上海铁道员工在解放军打到那里，就把铁道修到那里的精神，只要解放军渡海到那里，我们船就开到那里，以支援前线，巩固人民共和国。刚从仰光归国的华侨伟光贸易公司经理郑煌，认为人民政治协商会议有十六个华侨代表，中央人民政府有两个华侨委员，这是华侨在毛主席领导下第一次在政治上得到地位。他希望华侨代表回到海外后，应将人民政协开会情况向侨胞充分宣传，使每个侨胞都起来协助建设新中国。其余工商界人士对于人民政府所属三十个部、会、署、行中有十六个部属于经济建设部门，极表拥护。他们认为这是中央人民政府重视发展生产，繁荣经济的具体表现。全国工商业前途是极为光明的。各界人士都主张要以实际行动来拥护毛主席和中央人民政府。
