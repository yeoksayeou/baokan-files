　　“One Third of All Humanity”
  　Swedish Communist Newspaper Cheers Sino-Soviet Handshake
    Norwegian Communist Newspaper Congratulates New China
    [Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 20th] Copenhagen dispatch: The Swedish Communist newspaper "Ny Dag," in an editorial titled "One Third of All Humanity," discussing the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union, wrote: "The Soviet Union's recognition of the Central People's Government of China and the Chinese Central People's Government's gratitude to the Soviet government unite the two governments. This handshake represents 670 million people, one third of all humanity. This is truly the second greatest event in human history. The first greatest event was the October Socialist Revolution. The revolutions in Russia and China are two terrible blows to imperialism, two major rifts in the antiquated capitalist system that has been abandoned by history. From the Pacific to Berlin, all the people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, are victoriously fighting for democracy and socialism. China's entry into the democratic and peaceful camp is a thousand times more powerful than all the atomic bombs that the gold-yuan emperors possess and may possess in the future. The cause of democracy and socialism is indestructible, and the forces of peace are far stronger than the forces of war."
    The Norwegian Communist newspaper "Friheten" commented on the founding of the People's Republic of China, saying: "The Norwegian people have no reason to harbor a hostile attitude towards the new China. The Norwegian people have no special rights or other capital interests in China, nor do they want to have any. Now, the new regime has begun construction work, which will transform the backward, semi-feudal agricultural country into a progressive country with civilized and highly cultured people. If Norwegians, Norwegian sailors, engineers, and other specialists can participate in this work on the basis of equality and mutual respect, as free people should, it will be extremely beneficial to Norway. The Chinese people are a free people, a great people, great not only in number, but also in the amazing heroism and vitality they have shown in the struggle for liberation. This people will certainly demonstrate equally great ability in peaceful work. We Norwegians must maintain friendship with such a people. Therefore, the people must demand that Norway immediately recognize the People's Republic of China and establish diplomatic relations with it."

　　“全人类的三分之一”
  　瑞典共产党报纸欢呼中苏握手
    挪共报纸祝贺新中国
    【新华社布拉格二十日电】哥本哈根消息：瑞典共产党报纸“尼·达格”报在以“全人类的三分之一”为题的社论中，论及中苏建立外交关系时写道：“苏联承认中国中央人民政府和中国中央人民政府对苏联政府的感谢使得两国政府联合起来了。这一握手，代表了六亿七千万人，占全人类的三分之一。这实是人类历史上第二件大事。第一件最大的事情是十月社会主义革命。俄国和中国的革命，是对帝国主义的两个可怕的打击，是陈腐的已为历史所抛弃的资本主义制度的两大裂隙。从太平洋到柏林，全体人民正在共产党的领导下，胜利地为民主和社会主义而战。中国之进入民主和平阵线，胜过金元皇帝所拥有的和将来可能拥有的全部原子弹的一千倍。民主和社会主义的事业是不可破的，和平的力量已远较战争的力量为强大。”
    挪威共产党“佛利赫顿”报评中华人民共和国的成立说：“挪威人民没有任何理由对新中国抱敌视态度。挪威人民在中国没有任何特别权益或其他资本利益，而且也不想有。现在，新政权已开始建设工作，这将使中国从落后的半封建的农业国家变为进步的国家，有文明的和具备高度文化的人民。如果挪威人、挪威的海员、工程师及其他专门人员能够在平等与互相尊重的基础上，象自由人民之间所应有的那样，参加这一工作，当对挪威极为有利。中国人民是自由的人民，是伟大的人民，其伟大不仅是在数量上，而且还在于它在争取解放的斗争中所表现的惊人的英雄主义和活力。这个人民，在和平的工作中一定也将表现同样伟大的能力。我们挪威人必须与这样的人民保持友谊。因此，人民一定要求挪威立即承认中华人民共和国并与之建立外交关系。”
