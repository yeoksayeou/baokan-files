　　Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 18th: The strategically important coastal city of Xiamen Island in southeastern Fujian was liberated at 11:00 AM on the 17th, with the majority of the defending enemy troops annihilated. On the night of the 15th, under the cover of hundreds of artillery pieces, the People's Liberation Army, in a thousand boats like arrows, launched a sea assault on Xiamen Island and its northwestern part, Gulangyu. After two hours of beachhead fighting, they broke through the enemy's modernized steel and concrete fortifications and heavily defended positions, successfully landing. Continuing to advance fiercely into the enemy's territory, they first liberated Gulangyu on the night of the 16th, and then attacked Xiamen city in the early morning of the 17th, liberating the entire island by 11:00 AM. The tens of thousands of enemy troops under Tang Enbo were either annihilated or escaped by sea. We captured countless tanks, fortress guns, and other spoils of war. Detailed battle results are still being tallied.
　　Introduction to Xiamen
　　Xiamen City, formerly known as Siming County, is located on Xiamen Island in Xiamen Port, in the southeastern part of Fujian Province. It is situated in the center of the Shanghai-Hong Kong sea route and has very close ties with Southeast Asia. According to statistics from June of this year, the island has a population of approximately 200,000. Xiamen faces Jinmen Bay, and its port is sheltered by Jinmen Island, making it a strategic military location. It faces Tainan and Penghu in Taiwan across the sea, with a sea route of only 147 nautical miles to Tainan. After the liberation of Fuzhou, the remnants of the Fujian bandit army gathered in Xiamen, and the puppet Fuzhou Pacification Office and the puppet Fujian Provincial Government also fled to the area from Fuzhou. The bandit army vainly attempted to hold Jinmen and Xiamen as a shield for Taiwan. On the 7th of this month, the bandit leader Chiang Kai-shek secretly visited the island to carry out a final struggle. After the liberation of Xiamen, the gateway to Taiwan was opened, and the last nest of the Kuomintang bandit gang was completely exposed under the iron hammer of the People's Liberation Army.

　　打开进军台湾门户
  　我军解放厦门
  　守敌数万大部就歼
    【新华社福建前线十八日电】福建东南沿海军略要地厦门岛，已于十七日上午十一时解放，守敌大部就歼。人民解放军于十五日夜在数百门大炮掩护下，千舟如箭，向厦门岛及其西北之鼓浪屿发起渡海攻击，经两小时滩头战斗，即突破匪近代化钢骨水泥工事与重兵守备的防御阵地，登陆成功。继向敌阵纵深猛烈发展，十六日夜首先解放鼓浪屿，十七日拂晓攻入厦门市区，上午十一时全岛解放，守敌汤恩伯所部数万之众，除一部由海路逃脱外，悉数被歼。我缴获坦克、要塞炮等及其他战利品无数，详细战果正清查中。
    厦门介绍
    厦门市旧为思明县，在福建省东南部厦门港内之厦门岛上。地当沪港航路中心，与南洋关系非常密切。根据本年六月份统计，全岛人口约二十万人。厦门面临金门湾，其前有金门岛掩护港口，为一军事要地。隔海与台湾之台南及澎湖相望，海路至台南仅一四七海里。福州解放后，福建匪军的残部，都麇集厦门，伪福州绥靖公署及伪福建省政府亦由福州逃至该地。匪军妄图坚守金（门）厦（门），以为台湾之掩护。本月七日，匪首蒋介石曾潜赴该岛，进行最后挣扎。厦门解放后，台湾之门户洞开，国民党匪帮的最后巢穴，已完全暴露在人民解放军铁锤之下。
