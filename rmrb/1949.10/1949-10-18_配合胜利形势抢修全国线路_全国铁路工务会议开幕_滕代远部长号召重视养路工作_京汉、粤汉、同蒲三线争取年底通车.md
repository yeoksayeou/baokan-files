Minister Teng's speech first explained that in the rapid development of the victorious situation and the birth of the People's Republic of China, all railway employees must strive to complete the transportation tasks required by the country. He said: "With the efforts of the employees, we have supported the southward march of the Liberation Army, overcome the maritime blockade of American imperialism, and realized the Pinghu through train, which has not been seen for twelve years. Due to the development of the situation, our future tasks are even greater. In terms of repairs, the main lines are required to strive for the Jinghan Line, Yuehan Line, and the Tongpu Line from Fenglingdu in the south to Dingxiang in the north to be open to traffic by the end of this year, the middle section of Longhai (Luoyang to Tongguan) to be completed by November this year, and the Zhangshu and Pingxiang sections of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Line to be open to traffic by December 15th (excluding the Ganjiang Bridge). The Xiang-Gui-Qian Line will be repaired as it is liberated. The tasks for next year are: (1) Complete the Tong-Tang Line (Datong to Tanggu); (2) Complete the double-track of the China-Chang Line and the Shen (Yang)-Shan (Hai Guan)-Jing (Beijing) Line; (3) Restore the former trunk lines such as the Jin (Zhou)-Cheng (De)-Gu (Beikou) Line, etc.; (4) Eliminate slow driving to a minimum, and some bridge and line projects must become permanent; (5) Prepare for the construction of the Yangtze River Railway Bridge and the Yellow River Railway Bridge; (6) Build new lines such as Bao (Tou)-Lan (Zhou) and Tian (Shui)-Lan (Zhou)." Minister Teng pointed out: "The road maintenance work plan and the road maintenance responsibility system are the central issues of this conference. We mainly base our methods on the experience of the Soviet Union and our Northeast in the road maintenance responsibility system and prepare to promote it to the whole country in a planned way. We must eliminate the old view of underestimating road maintenance work and promote the road maintenance movement in which employees and their families in Qinhuangdao, together with the local masses, cherish the people's railway. We call on all employees and railway-related personnel to participate in road maintenance with two hours of voluntary labor each week, and implement the idea of attaching importance to road maintenance work. All roads should formulate next year's road maintenance standards and road maintenance plans, as well as maintenance plans for bridges and buildings, based on this year's line overhaul, and plan the quantity and methods of preparing materials, making material preparations in all aspects. First of all, we must seize the time to strengthen the political, cultural, and professional learning of engineering workers, convey the spirit and content of this conference, and prepare for the glorious task of road maintenance and new railway construction in 1950."
