The Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce Preparatory Committee's Investigation and Research Department released a statistical table on the recovery and progress of 41 private industries in Shanghai during July, August, and September of this month. This statistical table is based on surveys conducted by various trade associations among their member factories. Although the statistics do not include all private factories in the city (factories not belonging to industry associations and those that did not submit survey forms are not included), they generally show that Shanghai's industry is gradually recovering. Shanghai has over 90 types of industries, and these 41 types are mostly industries needed for people's livelihood and industrial construction. Some luxury goods industries are not included in the statistics. The statistics are presented as follows:

(1) Industries operating at 100% capacity in September: 1. Rice milling industry, with 116 factories, operated at 100% capacity in July, August, and September; 2. Acid and alkali industry, with 9 factories, operated at 77% capacity in July, and 100% capacity in August and September; 3.

(8) The soda and juice industry, with 36 factories, operated at 91.66% capacity in July, 20% capacity in August, and was completely shut down in September.

The above statistics show the general trend of industrial recovery in Shanghai. Further analysis reveals that the rapid recovery of these industries is mainly due to the fact that these industries are mostly: (1) Industries essential for people's livelihood. Industries such as rice milling, flour, and coal briquettes operate at 90% to 100% capacity; cultural supplies such as printing ink, color printing, photoengraving, and type and copper molds operate at 90% to 100% capacity, indicating the people's need for new culture in the liberated areas. (2) Industries that support national construction and industrial construction in various regions, such as heavy industries like shipbuilding and machinery industry, are also recovering and improving; the acid and alkali industry's 100% operation proves the need for chemical raw materials due to the improvement of various industries in the city. (3) Industries geared towards the countryside. The ironware industry, which forges rural tools and various daily-use iron products, experienced increased demand in rural areas after the autumn harvest, so their operating rate rapidly increased from 20% to 98%. (4) Industries that are needed by the people and have gradually solved the problems of raw materials and sales. The recent rapid improvement in industries such as cotton spinning, dyeing and weaving, and yarn spinning is due to the resolution of raw material issues with the assistance of the People's Government, the expansion of the South China liberated area, the increasing sales in South China, and the increased purchasing power of the old liberated areas; the bristle processing industry, which used to be shut down in April before liberation, has gradually recovered due to improved foreign export trade.

　　上海市必需工业的恢复　
    上海工商联筹备会四十一行业调查报告
    上海工商联合会筹备会调查研究处，本月二十日发表上海市四十一种私营工业在七、八、九三个月工业恢复进展情况统计表。此项统计表系根据各同业公会向其所属会员工厂调查所得，统计内虽未包括全市全部私营工厂（未加入工业公会的工厂，以及未填调查表者不在内），但大致可以看出上海市工业在逐渐恢复中。按上海市工业共约九十余种，此四十一种工业，多系为人民生活、工业建设需要的工业。若干奢侈品工业未统计在内。兹将该统计分述如后：

    （七）在九月份百分之四十以上开工的工业：一、纺织用品工业共五一家，七月份百分之六四开工，八月份百分之二五开工，九月份百分之四三·五三开工；二、玻璃业共五五家，七月份百分之九·○九开工，八月份百分之二八开工，九月份百分之四二开工；三、制帽业共三六家，七月份百分之一○开工，八月份百分之四一·一八开工；四、调味粉业七月份百分之五○开工，八月份百分之四三开工，九月份百分之四○开工；五、阳伞业共七一家，七月份百分之九一·五开工，八月份百分之三八开工，九月份百分之四一·二○开工。
    （八）汽水果汁业共三六家七月份百分之九一·六六开工，八月份百分之二○开工，九月份全部停工。
    以上统计，可以看出上海市工业一般恢复趋向。如加分析，还可看出以上工业迅速恢复，是由这些工业多半是：（一）为民生所必需的工业。如碾米、面粉、煤球等工业，百分之九十到百分之百开工；文化用品如油墨、彩印、照相制版、铜模铅字等工业，百分之九十到百分之百的开工，说明解放区人民大众对新文化的需要。（二）配合国家建设及各地工业建设的工业，如重工业造船、机器工业，亦恢复好转起来；再如酸碱工业百分之百开工，是证明本市各种工业好转故需要化学原料。（三）面向农村的工业。铁器工业是锻打农村用具及各种日用品铁器的工业，在秋收后农村需要量增加，所以他们开工的百分率迅速由百分之二十增加到百分之九十八。（四）为人民所需要而又逐渐解决了原料销路问题的工业。如棉纺、染织、纺线等工业，最近迅速好转是由于原料问题在人民政府协助下获得解决，及华南解放区扩大，华南销路日益扩大，及老解放区购买力的增高所致；猪鬃整理工业在解放前四月份一向停顿，近因对外出口贸易好转故能逐渐恢复。
