　　Establishing a New Financial Management System
　　National Railway Financial Conference Opens
　　滕Daiyuan Minister Calls for Absorbing Soviet Experience
　　[This dispatch] The first National Financial Conference convened by the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government opened yesterday (the 20th) in the capital. The conference is scheduled to last ten days. The main content of the meeting is to report on the work from January to September of this year, in order to study the issue of national railway financial unification, and to decide on a unified national railway accounting system for the future. The conference began at 8:00 a.m. on the 20th, attended by 53 representatives from the Northern, Southern, and Northeastern Railway Administrations and directly affiliated bureaus of the Ministry of Railways, as well as 47 Soviet railway financial experts and professors from Jiaotong University, totaling 100 people. After Director Zhu Shaotian of the Finance Bureau announced the opening, Minister Teng Daiyuan delivered an important speech in the morning. First, he talked about the tasks of economic construction in the future, and second, he talked about some opinions on the financial conference. He pointed out that in the past, railways were managed independently and fragmented. Now that they have become the people's railways, they should gradually move towards a complete and unified path. Therefore, finance also needs a new system and methods suitable for the financial management of the people's railways. Without sound financial work, it will not be possible to manage the railways well, ensure the completion of tasks, and enable the people's railway cause to develop and expand reasonably. Therefore, this meeting needs to solve the unification of the accounting system, the unification of the budget system, and the unification of finance.

　　Unified Accounting System
　　(1) Unified Accounting System. The old Chinese railway accounting system was drafted by British and American accountants during the warlord era in 1913, and has basically not been revised for more than 30 years. During the Japanese occupation, the Japanese accounting system was implemented, which is still not suitable for needs today. The new accounting system must: First, be suitable for the characteristics of railway enterprises; second, implement the principle of responsibility, with responsibility at each level and inspection at each level; third, require precise cost accounting to understand the correct transportation costs in a timely manner and accurately calculate profits and losses; fourth, require simple procedures, easy recording, and rapid and accurate reports for easy settlement. Since May, the Finance Bureau has adopted the basic principles of the Soviet railway accounting system, and taking into account the current environment and conditions, after five months of repeated research, discussion and revision, a draft of the national railway unified accounting provisional system has been preliminarily drafted, which needs to be carefully studied, revised and passed, and then implemented with the approval of the Central People's Government.

　　Strengthen Budget and Unified Finance
　　(2) Strengthen the budget system. Production without a plan and without a budget is blind and does not meet our economic needs. The old concept of making a budget for the purpose of receiving funds should be overcome. It is hoped that everyone will discuss the provisional regulations on railway budgets, and the spirit of planning and responsibility must be implemented. (3) Unification of railway finance. Without unification, it is impossible to implement the budget, unify the plan, and unify income and expenditure. The steps and methods of unification need to be studied in detail at the meeting. (4) Strengthen the financial inspection system. In order to achieve a high degree of financial centralization and overcome bureaucracy and eliminate corruption and waste, the financial inspection system must be strictly implemented. The prior review, regular inspection and audit of the final accounts must be strict and serious. In addition to the financial organs having to grasp this work, sometimes a certain part of the preliminary and final accounts must be reviewed and decided by the masses. (5) Train financial cadres in a planned way in order to achieve self-reliance and self-sufficiency for the people's railways.

　　Soviet railway financial expert Zosimov delivered a speech, saying that the Soviet Union also encountered various difficulties when reforming financial accounting after the revolution, which were overcome through the efforts of comrades under the leadership of Marshal Stalin. He believes that China will also be able to overcome all difficulties under the leadership of Chairman Mao.

　　Director Zhu of the Finance Bureau Reports
　　Railway Finance Issues
　　Then, Director Zhu of the Finance Bureau of the Ministry of Railways reported on financial work. The first part is an overview of railway finance: (1) Funding and investment allocated by the state to the Ministry of Railways. Including the funding provided by the state to the Ministry of Railways and subsidies for the operating expenses, road construction material expenses, and labor costs of the North China Railway Bureau (excluding the in-kind supply of clothing, food, and fodder for the Railway Corps), as well as investment related to road construction, machine installation in factories, and the revival of dead vehicles, the total allocation is approximately 315 million jin when converted to rice. (2) Railway operating revenue and expenditure. Due to the adjustment of railway freight rates and the increase in the number of loading and unloading vehicles, the operating income of each railway bureau in the Northern and Southern regions has shown a monthly increase. For example, the operating income of the four railway bureaus in the North in June was only 2.6 billion yuan, but in September it increased to 25.7 billion yuan, which is more than three times the rate of rice price increase. The income of the Shanghai Bureau in the South was 4 billion yuan in July and increased to 13 billion in September. Currently, except for the Hengyang and Zhengzhou Bureaus, which have relatively large deficits, and the Taiyuan Bureau, which has a slight deficit, the remaining bureaus have surpluses. The second part of the report is the current existing problems: (1) It is necessary to strictly implement the policy of unification. The newly drafted railway provisional accounting system has the following four characteristics: First, accounting subjects are established by production departments as units, which facilitates the responsibility and inspection of each department at each level, and implements the spirit of the responsibility system. Second, pay attention to cost accounting and calculate depreciation. The transportation cost is calculated in a timely manner every month. Third, the accounting requires accuracy and the procedures require simplification. (2) Implement the idea of enterprise. Enterprise departments must pay attention to reducing costs, overcoming waste, saving materials, and improving labor efficiency. In terms of financial work, it is required to prepare a good budget. The newly drafted railway budget provisional regulations have four characteristics: (1) The operating revenue and expenditure budget and the operating expense budget are separated. (2) The budget preparation must be based on precisely calculated production tasks and standards, and cannot be abstractly based on past experience. (3) The budget is mass-based, comes from the masses, and is compiled from bottom to top. After it is determined, it is sent back to the masses to supervise its implementation. (4) Budget preparation emphasizes hard work and starting a business, and being realistic. (3) Launch extensive savings. For example, the discarding of materials along the line, and the necessary personnel adjustments have not been carried out or have not been carried out enough, resulting in great losses. Attention should also be paid to saving in small aspects, accumulating small amounts into large amounts. Shanghai, Tianjin, Northeast and other places have achieved very good results in saving. (4) Train financial cadres. In particular, everyone is called upon to learn from the advanced railway financial work experience of the Soviet Union.

　　In the afternoon, Hu Zuobin, director of the Finance Department of the Finance Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, made a profound explanation of the new spirit of the accounting system—the responsibility system in financial work, pointing out that the past budget system was only for the purpose of asking for money, and the accounting system was not in line with scientific management. Now, a responsibility system of budgeting and final accounting from bottom to top by various departments and units should be adopted in order to facilitate accurate calculation and scientific management. Finally, Han Bo, Minister of Finance of the Northeast Railway Administration, reported on the financial revenue and expenditure from January to September, the progress of property inventory and inspection, and the issues of anti-corruption and waste, and the meeting adjourned at 5:30.

　　建立财务管理新制度
  　全国铁路财务会议揭幕
    滕代远部长号召吸收苏联经验
    【本报讯】中央人民政府铁道部召集的第一次全国财务会议，已于昨（二十）日在首都揭幕。会期预定十天。会议的主要内容是汇报今年一月至九月份的工作，以便研究全国铁路财政统一的问题，并决定今后全国统一的铁路会计制度。大会于二十日上午八时开始，出席的有北方、南方、东北各管理局和铁道部直属各局代表五十三人，及苏联铁路财务专家、中国交通大学教授等四十七人，共计一百人。财务局朱劭天局长宣布开幕后，上午滕代远部长发表重要讲话。首先谈到今后经济建设的任务，其次，谈到对财务会议的几点意见。指出：过去铁路是各自为政，支离破碎的，现在成为人民的铁路，即应逐渐走上完整统一的道路，因之财务上也需要一套适合于人民铁道财务管理的新制度和办法。如果没有健全的财务工作，就不能很好的管理铁路，保证任务的完成，不能使人民铁路事业合理地发展和扩大。所以这个会需要解决会计制度的统一，预算制度的统一和财政的统一等问题。
    统一会计制度
    （一）统一会计制度。中国旧铁路的会计制度是一九一三年军阀时代请英美会计人员拟定的，三十多年来，基本上未曾修改。日本侵占时期施行了日本会计制度，到今天都不能适合需要。新的会计制度必须：第一、适合铁道企业的特性，第二、贯彻负责的原则，层层负责，层层检查。第三、要求有精密的成本计算，能及时了解正确的运输成本，能精确的计算盈亏。第四、要求手续简便，便于记载；表报迅速准确，便于结算。从五月份开始，财务局即采用了苏联铁路会计制度的基本原则，并照顾目前环境和条件，经过五个月的反复研究、讨论修改，初步拟出了全国铁路统一会计暂行制度草案，需要切实研讨修改通过后，经中央人民政府批准施行。
    加强预算统一财政
    （２）加强预算制度。没有计划没有预算的生产是盲目的，不适合我们经济的需要，并应克服过去造预算是为了领款的旧观念。希望大家讨论铁路预算暂行条例，必须贯彻计划性及负责制的精神。（３）铁路财政的统一。不统一则无法实行预算，无法统一计划，统一收支。关于统一的步骤方式，会上需要加以详细的研究。（４）加强财务检查制度。为了达到财务高度集中与克服官僚主义肃清贪污浪费，就必须严格执行财务检查制度。对于事前的审核，经常的检查与决算的审计都必须严格认真。除了财务机关必须抓紧这一工作外，有时还必须把某一部分预决算经过群众来审查决定。（５）要有计划的培养财务干部。以达到人民铁路的自立更生，自给自足。
    苏联铁路财务专家佐西莫夫致词，说苏联在革命后改革财务会计时也遇到种种困难，在斯大林大元帅领导之下经诸同志的努力才克服了。他相信中国在毛主席领导之下，也一定能克服一切困难。
    财务局朱局长报告
    铁路财政问题
    接着铁道部财务局朱局长报告财务工作。第一部分是铁路财政概况：（一）国家拨给铁道部的经费及投资。包括国家给铁道部的经费及贴补华北两路局的营业费、修路材料费、工费（不包括铁道兵团被服粮秣等实物供给）、以及关系修路的投资、各工厂按装机器，死车复活等费，共拨款分期折米约三亿一千五百万斤。（二）铁路营业收支。北方、南方各路局由于铁道运价调整，装卸车数增加，各路局营业收入逐月表现增加。如北方四路局六月份营业收入不过二十六亿元，九月份则增至二百五十七亿元，与米价上涨率三倍比较还多。南方之上海局七月份收入为四十亿元，九月份增到了一百三十亿。目前除衡阳、郑州两局赤字较大，太原稍有赤字外，其余各局已有盈余。报告的第二部分是目前存在的问题：（一）要厉行统一方针。这次新拟定之铁路暂行会计制度有以下四种特点：第一，以生产部门为单位，分立会计科目，便于各部门层层负责，层层检查，贯彻负责制精神。第二，注意成本核算，计算折旧。每月及时计出运输成本。第三，核算要求精确，手续要求简化。（二）贯彻企业化思想。企业部门必须注意减低成本、克服浪费、节约器材、提高劳动效率。财务工作方面就要求编制好的预算。新拟定之铁路预算暂行规程特点有四：（１）营业收支预算与事业费预算分立。（２）预算编制须根据精密计算之生产任务及标准，不能抽象凭借过去经验。（３）预算群众化，从群众中来，由下而上的编制、确定后，送回群众中监督执行。（４）编制预算强调刻苦兴家，实事求是。（三）广泛展开节约。如沿线抛弃材料，必要的人事调整未进行或进行不够致损失很大。小的方面也要注意节约，积少成多。上海、京津、东北等地节约收效都很好。（四）培养财务干部。特别号召大家学习苏联的先进铁路财务工作经验。
    下午铁道部财务局财务处胡作宾处长对会计制度的新精神——财政工作中的负责制作了深刻的解释，指出过去的预算制度只是为了要钱，会计制度是不合乎科学管理的，现在应该采取各部门各单位自下而上做预算决算的负责制。以便于精确计算，科学管理。最后由东北铁路总局财务部长韩博报告一至九月份财政收支情况，财产清理检查经过及反贪污浪费等问题，于五时半始行散会。
