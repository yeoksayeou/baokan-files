　　Electric Tram Company Repair Factory
    Successfully Self-Manufactures Automatic Brake Boxes and Fire Glass Rings
    [Beijing News] Workers at the Beijing Electric Tram Company Repair Factory, while completing the Second Hundred Vehicle Movement, successfully self-manufactured automatic brake boxes and fire glass rings, overcoming the difficulty of lacking machine parts for many years. Soviet electric tram experts recently visited the factory and highly praised the creative spirit of the factory workers.
    Self-manufacturing automatic brake boxes requires asbestos board, which was previously imported from the West, but the supply was cut off seven years ago, and most domestic products are not suitable, causing difficulties for many years. Before liberation, engineers had tried to manufacture it several times, but were unsuccessful. After liberation, during the First Hundred Vehicle Movement, they were just piecing together some damaged ones for use. At that time, it was the height of the production surge, and case worker Liu Mengxing, electrician Xin Wenshan, Zhang Desheng, riveter Liu Guizhen, etc., in order to compete to be creative heroes, used their rest time after work to study self-manufacturing methods. The first time, they used shredded paper pulp, chicken feather ash, and lacquer powder, and burned it with a gasoline lamp. Although it was made, the cost was too high. So they changed to using asbestos and cement, adding water and pressure to make small pieces of asbestos board. After the experiment was successful, they studied how to use it to make automatic brake boxes. The first step was to make a cast iron mold, but it was put aside because everyone was busy with production. During the Second Hundred Vehicle Movement, the repair factory management committee mobilized the foreman and workers of the case work and lathe work to assist in making the mold. Liu Mengxing and Xin Wenshan studied the ingredients, using three-quarters of cement and one-quarter of asbestos, mixed with water, loaded into the mold and pressed, air-dried, and then soaked in water. After it dries again, it is finished, which is hard, insulated, and fire-resistant, and the cost is extremely low, only one thousand yuan per piece. The problem of automatic brake boxes for many years has been solved.
    Recently, the factory also successfully self-manufactured fire glass rings. Because most of the electric tram's electric rollers have been used for twenty-five years, the fire glass rings inside the commutator (ie, copper head) have been worn and burned out, and for several years they have only been patched with thin fire glass. After the fire in the repair factory in April this year, the fire glass rings in the burned commutators became a pile of fragments, making it impossible to repair. Factory director Huang Bojin designed a six-lobed cast iron mold, and electrician Yuan Fengxiang designed to peel the domestic fire glass into thin slices, cut them into small strips, and paste them one by one around the mold core. Tighten layer by layer, glue sixteen layers, press tightly with the mold cover, and heat to form a seamless fire glass ring. The first test run, because they did not understand the shrinkage of the ring after drying and cooling, the finished product was slightly smaller than the standard size. So they added a hoop around the mold core to increase its outer diameter. And three small wheels were installed under the mold base to facilitate gluing. In this way, the second fire glass ring was successfully made. It can withstand 5,000 volts. This kind of fire glass ring is stronger than the foreign fire glass ring that comes with the electric roller (made of broken fire glass paper).

### 电车公司修造厂  自制自动闸盒、火玻璃圈成功

　　电车公司修造厂　
    自制自动闸盒、火玻璃圈成功
    【北京讯】京市电车公司修造厂职工，在完成第二次百辆车运动中，自制自动闸盒和火玻璃圈，克服了多年来机件缺乏的困难。苏联电车专家最近参观该厂时，非常称赞该厂职工这种创造精神。
    自制自动闸盒，要用石绵板，而过去用的是西洋货，七年前就断了来源，国货多不适用，多年来很感困难。解放前，工程师们曾经试制过几次，都没成功。解放后在第一次百辆车运动中，就是拼补了些残破的使用。当时正值生产高潮，案工刘梦星，电工辛文山、张德胜，铆工刘贵珍等，为了争作创造英雄，利用下班后休息时间，研究自制的方法。第一次用碎纸浆、鸡毛灰和漆片粉作，用汽油灯烧。虽然制成了，可是成本太高。于是改用石绵和洋灰，加水和压力做成小块的石绵板。试验成功后，又研究如何利用它做自动闸盒，第一步先做了生铁闷子，后因大家忙于生产而搁下了。在第二次百辆车运动中，修造厂管委会动员了案工和旋工的领班和工友协助做成了闷子。刘梦星和辛文山两人研究好了配料，用四分之三的洋灰和四分之一的石绵，用水调匀，装入闷子压制，阴干后再用水泡。再干后即成，既坚硬、又隔电、又耐火，而且成本极低，每块才合一千元。多年来的自动闸盒问题得到解决。
    最近，该厂自制火玻璃圈，也获得成功。由于电车的电滚子，大部分已使用了二十五年，整流子（即铜头）内部的火玻璃圈，已经磨损烧坏，几年来只靠用薄火玻璃黏修贴补。今年四月修造厂失火后，被烧的整流子中的火玻璃圈已成一堆碎片，以致无法镶补了。黄伯金厂长就设计了一份六瓣生铁闷子，由电工袁凤祥设计把国产火玻璃揭成薄片，裁成小条，一条一条的贴在闷子心的周围。一层一层拴紧，黏十六层，用闷子盖压紧，加热使结成一个无缝的火玻璃圈。第一次试作，因不了解该圈干燥冷却后的收缩度，以致成品比标准尺寸稍小。于是又把闷子心周围加了一道箍，使它外径加大。并在闷子底座下按了三个小轮子，使便于黏贴，这样，第二个火玻璃圈就顺利的造成了。可以经五千电压。这种火玻璃圈，比起随着电滚子来的外国火玻璃圈（是碎火玻璃纸做的）还结实。
