　　Anshan Iron and Steel Company Workers' Representative Conference
  　Discusses Launching a New Record-Breaking Campaign
    [This newspaper, Anshan dispatch] The first Workers' Representative Conference of Anshan Iron and Steel Company concluded on the afternoon of the 16th, lasting four days. On the first day of the conference, Wang Qun, Deputy Director of the Trade Union, Li Dazhang, Manager of the Company, and Yang Chunmao, Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, reported on the work of the Trade Union, the Company, and the creation of new records. They pointed out that the Trade Union had achieved considerable success in training employees, registering reactionary party and special agent members, handling labor insurance and welfare work, evaluating wages, and launching production merit campaigns. The company had completed 91 major construction projects in the past six months, averaging 33 days ahead of schedule, saving 139,000 workdays. In terms of production, iron products were completed at 104%, and non-ferrous metal products at 115%, which was the result of workers' enthusiastic production and support from all parties. They called for promoting the new heroism of the working class, responding to and implementing the decisions and instructions of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government, and creating a vigorous new production movement in the Anshan Iron and Steel Company. In the speeches of the workers, many concrete suggestions were put forward, such as adjusting unreasonable organizational structures, establishing a system of inspection, summary, rewards and punishments, strengthening the connection between the trade union and the administration, and strengthening workers' technical learning. However, the workers unanimously believed that the biggest obstacle to the future of this movement was the bureaucratic and seriously undemocratic style of leadership of the administration and trade unions in some factories and mines.
    On the last day of the conference, Wang Qun made a summary report, pointing out that the 464 proposals received by the conference had been handed over to the relevant departments for thorough research, processing and adoption. He also admitted that the trade union leadership had been insufficiently clear about the concept of surrounding production in the past, and that it must get rid of the circle of clericalism in the future, study production, lead workers to complete and exceed production tasks, implement everyone running the trade union, overcome the bureaucratic style of the trade union, and launch a new record-breaking movement.

　　鞍山钢铁公司工代会议
  　讨论展开创造新纪录
    【本报鞍山专讯】鞍山钢铁公司第一次工人代表会议历时四天，已于十六日下午宣告闭幕。大会第一日由工会副主任王群、公司经理李大璋和市委书记杨春茂等报告工会、公司工作和创造新纪录等问题。他们指出工会在训练职工、登记反动党团特务分子、办理劳动保险福利工作、评议工资及发动生产立功运动等方面，获得相当成绩，公司半年来九十一件修建大工程，平均提前三十三天完成，节省了十三万九千个工。生产方面，铁制品完成百分之一百零四，非铁制品完成百分之一百一十五，这是工人热烈生产和各方支持的结果。他们号召发扬工人阶级新英雄主义，响应并贯彻中共中央东北局及东北人民政府工业部的决定和指示，在鞍山钢铁公司造成一个轰轰烈烈的新生产运动。在工友的发言中，提出了很多具体建议，如调整不合理的组织机构，建立检查总结奖惩制度，加强工会与行政联系，加强工友技术学习等。但工友一致认为造成这一运动前途的最大障碍，是若干工厂矿山的行政和工会领导作风存在官僚主义及严重缺乏民主。
    大会最后一天，由王群作总结报告，指出，大会收到的四百六十四件提案，已分别交有关部门确切研究处理和采纳，并承认工会领导上对围绕生产的观念，过去不够明确，今后必须摆脱事务主义圈子，钻研生产，领导工人完成并超过生产任务，实行大家办工会，克服工会官僚主义作风，展开创造新纪录运动。
