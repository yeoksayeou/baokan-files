　　On Lu Xun
    Faddeyev
    Faddeyev, head of the Soviet cultural and artistic science workers delegation, wrote an article in Shanghai to commemorate Lu Xun before returning to the Soviet Union. The article is as follows:

    In Western Europe and the United States, there are still writers who are extreme individualists. They are people in the so-called "ivory tower," they are people "for art's sake." These writers are deceptive writers. They know very well who they are serving. Art that does not move people's hearts, art that is inhumane, is a degenerate art. In reality, it is no longer art. And the personality of a true writer is formed by the people who produce him. The clearer the writer is about this, the more consciously he can serve the people, the higher his personality, the more talented he is, and the more outstanding he is as a writer. Lu Xun belongs to this kind of writer. He once said: "I started writing short stories with the aim of describing life and helping to transform it. Therefore, all my ideas are linked to the lives of the unfortunate people in our morbid society. I want to tell the pain and suffering of these people in order to cure them. And I want to use the power of my works to transform society." (Editor's note: The above quotation is a rough summary of Mr. Lu Xun's article.) As a writer, Lu Xun was so profound and knowledgeable that a whole book could be written about him. In the half-century of Lu Xun's life, almost no aspect of the Chinese people's life was not described by Lu Xun with the pen of an artist and critic. It is precisely because of these characteristics of his genius that Lu Xun is a genius thinker and genius writer belonging to the new humanity. I dare not judge Lu Xun as a historian, artist, critic, political commentator, educator, and revolutionary. I will only say a few words about Lu Xun as an artist and writer. Lu Xun's creation is as intimate to us Russian writers as the creation of writers from other countries can only enjoy, except for the writers of our motherland. He is on par with Chekhov and Gorky. The more widely we introduce Lu Xun to Russian readers—and we will do so—the more widespread this feeling of intimacy with Lu Xun will be among the Russian people. On the other hand, it is no accident that Lu Xun himself was so happy to translate the works of Russian classical writers into Chinese. Lu Xun's humanistic nature makes us Russians feel intimate. To be fair, the humanism of the old Russian literature of the nineteenth century came from Gogol's "The Overcoat," from a novel depicting a small Russian figure. Lu Xun's humanism is best explored in his novel "The True Story of Ah Q." This novel depicts a small Chinese figure. However, the protagonist of Gogol's "The Overcoat" is a petty official, while the protagonist of "The True Story of Ah Q" is a small farmhand, which is enough to show Lu Xun's strengths and illustrate Lu Xun's populism. However, do not forget that there is a distance of almost a century between these two writers. All Russian literature after Lu Xun is also primarily concerned with the fate of farmers. Lu Xun makes us Russian readers feel intimate because, like our classical writers, he is a critical realist writer, that is, a writer who exposes and attacks the forces of the old society that oppress the people and exclude the personality of the "little people." Lu Xun is similar to Chekhov in sympathizing with and pitying the "little people" but also understanding their weaknesses. However, Lu Xun's criticism of the old society is sharper than Chekhov's and has a more explicit social nature, and in this respect, it is close to Gorky. Of course, this is because Gorky and Lu Xun combined their writing careers with the vanguard of the liberation movement, with the most conscious and most advanced force in modern society—the Communist Party. Comrade Mao Zedong said very well about this characteristic of Lu Xun: "Lu Xun is the chief general of the Chinese cultural revolution. He is not only a great writer, but also a great thinker and a great revolutionary. Lu Xun's bones are the hardest. He has no trace of servility or flattery. This is the most precious character of the people of colonial and semi-colonial countries. Lu Xun is the unprecedented national hero on the cultural front who represents the majority of the whole nation and charges into battle against the enemy in the most correct, bravest, most resolute, most loyal, and most enthusiastic manner. Lu Xun's direction is the direction of the new culture of the Chinese nation." Lu Xun did not have time to point out the progressive forces of the new China in his literary works, only because he died too early. Everyone knows that he wanted to point out the progressive forces of the new China. In particular, he collected materials on the 25,000-mile Long March of the Chinese Red Army. Precisely as an artist, Lu Xun yearned to seek new figures—actors, fighters, and social reformers—so he loved Soviet art and literature, and he devoted so much effort to this literature that he became its translator and propagandist (for which we Soviet writers will always be grateful to Lu Xun). It was in the Soviet literature that grew vigorously on the soil of the new Soviet life that the new hero—the fighter and social reformer—first appeared after Gorky. Lu Xun had already found this new hero in his own Chinese soil. He found him among the vanguard of the Chinese national liberation movement. Lu Xun is a true Chinese writer, and for this reason, he has contributed many inimitable works of national form to world literature. His language is completely in folk form. His satire and humor, although possessing common human characteristics, also have inimitable national characteristics. Although it is very difficult to translate Lu Xun's works, without these characteristics, it would not be Lu Xun. Lu Xun is the glory of Chinese literature and a well-known representative of world literature. Lu Xun is a master of short stories. He is good at briefly, clearly, and simply visualizing ideas, using episodes to express major events, and using individuals to describe types. For example, "The True Story of Ah Q" is a masterpiece of Lu Xun's short stories. Lu Xun's satire and humor are expressed everywhere. But if in "The True Story of Ah Q," Lu Xun is a narrative writer who seems to narrate events impartially on the surface, then in "Repentance," he is a deeply lyrical writer who touches the heart. In short, Lu Xun is good at touching the main part of mankind in all his short stories—conscience, social conscience. This first of all illustrates the moral strength of his own soul. In commemoration of the thirteenth anniversary of the death of this lofty figure and writer, we Soviet writers pay tribute to him with great piety!

　　论鲁迅
    法捷耶夫
    苏联文化艺术科学工作者代表团团长法捷耶夫返苏前，曾在上海撰文纪念鲁迅，文如下：
    在西欧和美国一直到现在还存在着极端个人主义者的作家。他们是所谓“象牙之塔”里面的人，他们是“为艺术而艺术”的人。这些作家是骗人的作家。他们很清楚他们是为谁而服务。不感动人们心灵的艺术，无人性的艺术，这是一种退化了的艺术，真正讲起来，这个已经不是艺术了。而真正作家的人格则是由产生他的人民所形成的。作家对于这一点认识得愈清楚，他自己就愈能够自觉地为人民服务，他的人格就愈高，他就愈多才多艺，而作为作家来说，他就越发伟大。鲁迅是属于这种作家的。他曾说过：“我开始写短篇小说，其目的就是要描述生活，帮忙改造这个生活。因此我的全部构思是和我们的病态社会的不幸的人们的生活联在一起的。我要讲出这些人们的病痛和辛酸，为的是来治好它们。而且我要用我的作品的力量来改造社会。”（编者按：以上引文系鲁迅先生文章大意）作为作家的鲁迅，他是那样深刻和渊博，关于他本人简直可以写成一整本书。在鲁迅生前所经历的那半个世纪内，中国人民的生活几乎没有一方面不为鲁迅用艺术家和批评家的笔所描写过的。正是因为自己天才的这些特点，鲁迅才是属新人类的天才思想家，天才的作家。我不敢把鲁迅作为历史家，艺术家，批评家，政论家，教育家和革命家来衡论他。我只把鲁迅作为艺术家作家来对他讲几句话。鲁迅的创作对于我们俄国作家的亲切是除开我们祖国作家以外的其他国家作家的创作所仅能享有的那样亲切。他是和柴霍夫及高尔基并列的。我们对于俄国读者愈来广泛地介绍鲁迅——而我们将这样作——，那末这种对于鲁迅的亲切感觉在俄国人民中就愈为普遍。另一方面，鲁迅自己那样高兴把俄国古典作家的作品译成中文也不是偶然的。鲁迅由于他那种人道主义的性质而使我们俄国人感到亲切。平心而论，十九世纪旧的俄国文学的人道主义是由戈哥里的“外套”而来的，由描写一个俄国小人物的小说而来的。鲁迅的人道主义是由他的小说“阿Ｑ正传”最好地发掘出来的。这篇小说是描写一个中国小人物的。但是戈哥里的“外套”的主人翁是小官吏，而“阿Ｑ正传”的主人翁则是小雇农，这一点足以表示出鲁迅的优点，说明鲁迅的人民性。然而不要忘掉这两个作家之间是距离有几乎一个世纪之久的。在鲁迅以后的所有俄国文学也是首先关切农民命运的。鲁迅之所以使我们俄国读者感到亲切，更因为他和我们的古典作家一样，是批评的现实主义作家，也就是揭发并攻击压迫人民和排斥“小人物”个性的旧社会的势力的一个作家。在同情并怜悯“小人物”但同时又了解他的弱点的这一点上，鲁迅与柴霍夫是近似的。但是鲁迅对于旧社会的批评比较柴霍夫来得尖锐，有更明确的社会性质，而在这一点上就与高尔基相近了。当然这是因为高尔基和鲁迅把自己写作的生涯和解放运动的先锋队，和现代社会最觉悟的和最先进的力量——共产党结合在一起的。关于鲁迅这个特点，毛泽东同志说得很好：“鲁迅是中国文化革命的主将，他不但是伟大的文学家，而且是伟大的思想家与伟大的革命家。鲁迅的骨头是最硬的，他没有丝毫的奴颜与媚骨，这是殖民地半殖民地人民最可宝贵的性格。鲁迅是在文化战线上，代表全民族的大多数，向着敌人冲锋陷阵的最正确、最勇敢、最坚决、最忠实、最热忱的空前的民族英雄。鲁迅的方向，就是中华民族新文化的方向。”鲁迅在他的文艺作品中还没有来得及指出新中国的前进力量，这只是因为他死得太早了。大家都知道，他愿意指出新中国的前进力量。尤其是他搜集了中国红军二万五千里长征的材料。正因为作为一个艺术家。鲁迅渴望寻求新的人物——行动家，斗士和社会改造者，所以他热爱苏维埃艺术文学，他对于这一文学尽了如此大的力量，以至于他成为它的翻译者宣传者（对于这点，我们苏联作家永远要感谢鲁迅）。正是在新的苏维埃生活的土壤上茂壮长大的苏维埃文学中，第一次在高尔基之后，出现了新英雄——斗士和社会改造者。鲁迅已经在自己的中国土壤中找到了这一新的英雄，他在中国民族解放运动先锋队中间找到了他。鲁迅是真正的中国作家，正因为如此，他才给全世界文学贡献了很多民族形式的不可模仿的作品。他的语言完全是民间形式的。他的讽刺和幽默虽然具有人类共同的性格，但也带有不可模仿的民族特点。虽然翻译鲁迅作品是非常困难的，但如果没有这些特点，那就不成其为鲁迅了。鲁迅是中国文学的光荣，而且是世界文学的著名代表人物。鲁迅是短篇小说的能手。他善于简短地，明了地，朴素地把思想形象化，以插曲表现大的事件，以个别的人描写典型。例如，“阿Ｑ正传”是鲁迅短篇小说中的杰作。鲁迅的讽刺和幽默到处都表现出来。但是如果说在“阿Ｑ正传”中，鲁迅是一个表面上好象是大公无私地叙述事件的叙事的作家，那么在“忏悔”中，他是一个触动心弦的深刻抒情的作家。总之，鲁迅在他的所有短篇小说中都善于触及人类的主要部分——良心，社会良心。这首先是说明了他自己心灵的道德力量。为纪念这一崇高的人物和作家逝世十三周年，我们苏联作家以十分虔诚的心向他致敬！
