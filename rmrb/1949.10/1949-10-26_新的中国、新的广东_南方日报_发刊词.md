　　"A New China, A New Guangdong"
     ——Inaugural Editorial of "Southern Daily"
    The inaugural issue of the "Southern Daily," the organ of the South China Sub-Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, published an inaugural editorial entitled "A New China, A New Guangdong." After pointing out the great significance of the liberation of Guangzhou, the editorial stated: "Guangzhou was the earliest place in modern China to suffer from imperialist aggression and the starting point for imperialists to invade the Chinese mainland. Therefore, the people of Guangdong suffered the longest and deepest from imperialist oppression and exploitation. In the anti-imperialist struggle of the past hundred years, the people of Guangdong have shown particular bravery and determination. For example, in the struggle against the Opium War manufactured by British aggressors, in the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolutionary movement led by Hong Xiuquan, and in the Xinhai Revolution led by Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the people of Guangdong bravely fought against aggressors and oppressors. After the birth of the Communist Party of China, the people of Guangdong, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, bravely participated in the first Great Revolution of China (the Northern Expedition) from 1925 to 1927, the anti-imperialist land revolution from 1927 to 1936, the War of Resistance Against Japan from 1937 to 1945, and the People's Liberation War for more than three years since the surrender of Japan. For more than a hundred years, the ideals for which the revolutionary patriots and all the people of Guangdong sacrificed their blood and pursued in their dreams have been fully realized today under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, and under the heroic fighting of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Let us pay tribute to the martyrs and congratulate the people of Guangdong!" The inaugural editorial put forward the current and future tasks and missions for the people of Guangdong: "First, under the leadership of the Military Control Commission, assist the takeover work of the Military Control Commissions in various places." "Second, resume work, schooling, and business operations quickly, and restore normal life order." "Third, help the Military Control Commission, the Garrison Headquarters, the Public Security Bureau, and the garrisons in various places to stabilize social order, consolidate public security, and eliminate all the special agent sabotage conspiracies left and arranged by the Kuomintang bandit gang." "Fourth, strengthen the relationship between urban and rural areas and strengthen the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas." "Fifth, an important and long-term fundamental task for the people of Guangdong is to improve industrial and agricultural production and develop economic construction."
    The inaugural editorial said to the overseas Chinese in Guangdong: "Your motherland and homeland have been liberated. The motherland is thinking of you. You have assisted the motherland's revolutionary movements many times in the past, but the results have all failed. Only this revolution is a complete and earth-shaking victory for the Chinese people against imperialism and its running dogs, feudalism, bureaucratic capitalism, and its concentrated representative, the Kuomintang reactionaries. The class basis of all traitorous groups has been or will be eradicated root and branch, and the prosperity of the motherland can be expected soon. Only an independent and strong motherland of the people can protect you far overseas. At the same time, the motherland also expects you to assist in the process of building an independent and strong motherland."
    The inaugural editorial pointed out: "We still have serious tasks to complete and various difficulties to overcome. For example, the war is not completely over. Hainan Island, Taiwan, and the southwestern regions remain to be liberated, and the people of Guangdong must enthusiastically support the war to liberate the above-mentioned areas. Also, on the road to construction, we will certainly encounter various difficulties. Taking Guangdong as an example, after a long period of destruction and plunder by imperialism and its running dog, the Kuomintang reactionaries, it is full of devastation and lack of materials. We must also estimate the imperialist blockade and the sabotage of the remnant bandits, etc. These difficulties are waiting for us to overcome." The inaugural editorial pointed out the conditions for overcoming these difficulties: "We have the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, the experience of overcoming difficulties that are a thousand times greater than the current ones, the natural conditions with abundant resources, and the united cooperation of the 35 million people of Guangdong, who have always been known for their diligence, hard work, and entrepreneurship. Now is the turning point in the historical destiny of our motherland. Every worker, farmer, intellectual, national industrialist and businessman, and all patriotic democratic people should stand firm, clench their teeth, not be afraid of imperialist threats, not be tempted by imperialist interests, endure temporary pain, and overcome the economic difficulties of the current period. We call on the people of Guangdong, who have a glorious revolutionary tradition and a spirit of diligence and thrift, to rise up, economize on food and clothing, work diligently and conscientiously, to build our new China and new Guangdong."

　　“新的中国、新的广东”
     ——“南方日报”发刊词
    【新华社广州二十四日电】中共中央华南分局机关报“南方日报”创刊号以“新的中国、新的广东”为题，发表发刊词。发刊词在指明广州解放的重大意义以后说：“广州是近代中国遭受帝国主义侵略最早的一块地方，是帝国主义据以向中国内地侵略的出发点；因此，广东人民遭受帝国主义的压迫剥削为时最长，痛苦最深，而广东人民在百年来的反帝斗争中也表现出特别的英勇和坚决。如在反对英国侵略者制造的鸦片战争的斗争中，在洪秀全领导的太平天国革命运动中，在孙中山先生领导的辛亥革命运动中，我们广东人民都曾经英勇的对侵略者和压迫者进行了英勇和顽强的斗争。到了中国共产党产生了以后，广东人民更是在中国共产党的领导之下，英勇的参加过一九二五——一九二七年中国第一次的大革命（北伐战争），一九二七——一九三六年的反帝土地革命，一九三七——一九四五年的抗日战争以及日本投降以来三年多的人民解放战争。这一百多年来，广东革命志士和全体人民所牺牲流血，梦寐追求的理想，今天在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的正确领导之下，在中国人民解放军的英勇奋战之下，已经得到了完全的实现。让我们向先烈们致敬，向广东人民致贺！”发刊词向广东人民提出了当前和今后必须做的工作和任务：“首先，是在军管会的领导之下，协助各地军管会的接管工作”。“第二、是迅速的复工，复学，复业，恢复正常生活秩序”。“第三、是帮助军管会、警备司令部、公安局及各地驻军，安定社会秩序，巩固治安，扫除国民党匪帮残留和布置下的一切特务破坏阴谋”。“第四、是密切城乡关系，加强城乡的物资交流”。“第五、广东人民的一个最重要的长久的根本任务，就是提高工农业的生产，发展经济建设。”
    发刊词向广东侨胞说：“你们的祖国和家园都解放了。祖国挂念着你们。你们过去援助过祖国多次的革命运动，但是结果都失败了，只有这一次的革命，才是中国人民对帝国主义及其在华走狗封建主义、官僚资本主义及其集中的代表国民党反动派的翻天覆地的完全胜利的斗争。一切卖国贼集团的阶级基础都已被或即将被连根铲去，祖国的兴隆是可以计日而待的了。只有人民的独立强盛的祖国，才能保护远在海外的你们，同时祖国也期待着你们，希望在建设独立强盛的祖国的过程中，得到你们的协助。”
    发刊词指出：“我们还有严重的任务必须完成，还有种种的困难必须克服，例如：战争还没有完全结束，海南岛、台湾以及西南地区尚待解放，广东人民还要热烈地支援战争来解放上述各地；又如，在建设途中，我们还一定会遇到种种的困难，以广东而论，经过帝国主义及其走狗国民党反动派长期的摧残掠夺之后，满目疮痍，物资缺乏，还必须估计到帝国主义的封锁与残匪的捣乱等等，这些困难都等待我们去克服。”发刊词指出克服这些困难的条件说：“我们有中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导，有克服过比现在的困难超过千百倍的困难的经验，有物产丰富的自然条件，有素以善于刻苦耐劳创业成家著称的广东三千五百万人民的同心合作。现在是我们祖国历史命运的转变关头，每一个工人、农民、知识分子、民族工商业家，和一切爱国民主人士，在这个时机都应该站稳脚根，咬紧牙关，不怕帝国主义的威胁。不受帝国主义的利诱。忍受暂时的痛苦，把目前一个时期经济困难的这一道关口渡过去。我们号召：有光荣革命传统和勤俭创业精神的广东人民，奋发起来，节衣缩食，勤勤恳恳，来建设我们的新中国、新广东。”
