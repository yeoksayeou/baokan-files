　　Former Personnel of the Puppet Government's Embassies and Consulates in France
    United in Patriotic Actions; Gangster Threats and Inducements Fail
    [Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 14th] The news of eleven personnel from the former Kuomintang reactionary government's embassy and consulate in France declaring their support for the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China was widely published in European newspapers on the 11th. The French newspaper *l'Humanité* published most of the declaration. The British *Daily Worker* also published this news. Before the declaration of support for the Central People's Government by former Counselor Ling Qihan, Meng Juru, and others, the Kuomintang puppet government in Guangzhou attempted to suppress them by dismissing them from their positions as counselors and telegraphed its puppet embassy in London to send puppet minister Duan Maolan to Paris to "take over" the affairs of the embassy (because the former Kuomintang ambassador to France, Qian Tai, was injured in a car accident and was receiving medical treatment). This was sternly rejected by all eleven. The Kuomintang puppet government then colluded with the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs to exert pressure, demanding that the French Foreign Ministry announce that it would "no longer recognize those who signed the declaration as members of the diplomatic corps"; on the other hand, it spread rumors to divide the unity of all personnel. On the 9th of this month, the Kuomintang gang sent Dong Lin with a large sum of money to Paris to carry out threats and inducements. After Dong's continuous activities failed, it was heard that he would roll back to London. Note: The former Kuomintang diplomatic personnel in France who participated in this patriotic action were: Ling Qihan, Counselor with Minister's Rank; Meng Juru, Counselor; Xie Dongfa, First Secretary with Counselor's Rank; Wang Sicheng, First Secretary; Geng Chengzhi, Third Secretary; Tang Zupei, Third Secretary; Qian Nengxin, Third Secretary; Gong Chengcheng, Clerk (above are personnel of the former Embassy in France); Hu Youe, Vice Consul; Xiao Junshi, Trainee Consul; Zhang Zuyi, Clerk (above are personnel of the former Consulate in Paris).

　　前伪政府驻法使领馆人员
    团结一致坚持爱国举动
    匪帮威胁利诱均告失败
    【新华社布拉格十四日电】前国民党反动政府驻法大使馆及巴黎总领事馆人员十一人宣言拥护中华人民共和国中央人民政府的消息，十一日普遍刊载于欧洲各地报纸。法国人道报登载了宣言的绝大部分。英国工人日报亦刊载此项消息。在前参事凌其翰、孟鞠如等十一人发表拥护中央人民政府宣言之前，广州国民党伪政府就企图以免除他们二人的参事职务进行镇压，并电令其驻伦敦伪大使馆派伪公使段茂澜前往巴黎“接收”馆务（按前国民党驻法大使钱泰因撞车负伤在医疗中），当为十一人全体严词拒绝。国民党伪政府乃一方面勾结法政府外交部，施行压力，要法外交部宣布所谓“将不再承认那些签署宣言的人是外交团团员”；另一方面散布谣言来分化全体人员的团结。至本月九日，国民党匪帮又派董霖携巨款去巴黎，进行威胁利诱。董连日活动失败后，闻将滚回伦敦去。按：参加这一爱国举动的前国民党驻法外交人员为：公使待遇参事凌其翰，参事孟鞠如，参事衔一等秘书谢东发，一等秘书王思澄，三等秘书耿乘之，三等秘书唐祖培，三等秘书钱能欣，主事龚乘承（以上为前驻法大使馆人员），副领事胡有萼，随习领事萧君石，主事章祖贻（以上为前巴黎领事馆人员）。
