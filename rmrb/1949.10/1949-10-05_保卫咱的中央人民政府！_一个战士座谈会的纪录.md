　　"Defend Our Central People's Government!"
　　—A Record of a Soldiers' Symposium
　　(Recorded by Xiao Zelin and Xu Guangyao)

　　Upon hearing the news of the opening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), the People's Liberation Army soldiers stationed in Qinhuangdao jumped for joy, saying, "The Chinese people finally have their own masters! We must work hard to train and build a regularized national defense force to properly defend our Central People's Government!" The Third Battalion of the 598th Regiment—the very battalion of Special-Class Merit Recipient Li Guoying, who was honorably elected to the presidium of the CPPCC—was particularly high-spirited. When they received a letter from their Battalion Commander Li from Beijing, reporting that he had personally seen Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu and had shaken hands with them warmly, the soldiers cheered enthusiastically, feeling extremely honored. The soldiers of the machine gun and artillery company of the battalion convened a symposium, where they enthusiastically spoke, vying to express their understanding and thoughts. The following is an excerpt of the record of this symposium:

　　Yao Dianping (Second Platoon Leader): I was liberated when we were fighting in Zhangjiakou. At that time, my understanding of the Communist Party was very vague. Later, after various studies, I made some progress. Especially during the advance on Taiyuan, seeing the warm welcome from men, women, old, and young along the way, I felt that the Kuomintang was completely finished. I earned a minor merit during the battle of Taiyuan, and later the leadership approved me as platoon leader. Later, hearing that the CPPCC had opened, I was both happy and ashamed. Ashamed that I joined the revolution too late and didn't contribute much to the new China. Happy that although I didn't attend the meeting, the battalion commander did, which is not only the glory of the People's Liberation Army but also the glory of every one of us in the battalion and company.

　　Yang Haiquan (Sixth Squad Soldier): When I heard that the CPPCC had opened, the joy in my heart was indescribable. In the past, our China was a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country, constantly subjected to bullying and oppression. Now, it is a country of the people, a truly independent, democratic, and unified country, because this government works for the people. I was only liberated in Taiyuan recently, and I have encountered such a good situation. I will use my best efforts to study hard under the task of defending the national defense, strive to earn merit and join the Party, and carry the revolution to the end!

　　Zhang Shiying (Deputy Political Instructor): The CPPCC and the Central People's Government are the result of our decades of arduous struggle, nurtured by the blood of many revolutionary martyrs and the blood and sweat of the Chinese people. We must consolidate and defend it well. For thousands of years, the Chinese people had always been crawling on the ground, and whenever they raised their heads, they would be beaten down. Now, the Chinese people have stood up and can speak in the world. We will no longer be subjected to the imperialists or the reactionaries. I am determined to lead the entire company to train hard, protect national defense, and prevent the disruption of the imperialists!

　　Luo Yuyou (Fourth Squad Leader, Major Merit Recipient): In the past, the Chinese people were like children without a home, subjected to bullying everywhere. This year, we finally have a home. Not only are the Chinese people happy, but the people of all countries are also excited.

　　Mao Qingchun (First Platoon Deputy): That day, when the instructor said, "The CPPCC has opened!" I thought: This is not simple. Ten years of civil war, eight years of resistance war, and three years of liberation war, fighting north and south, only today has the government of the People's Republic been established. However, there is still imperialism in the world, and we must be prepared to fight at all times to defend the fruits of our hard work.

　　Liu Guocheng (Fifth Squad Deputy): Ever since I heard that the battalion commander was attending the CPPCC, I have been going to the company headquarters every day to look for newspapers, hoping that the Central People's Government would appear quickly. That day (the 22nd) when I came back from the exercise, I saw the slogan "Support the Opening of the CPPCC!" and I felt indescribable joy in my heart. The suffering I endured in the Chahar-Suiyuan Campaign was not in vain! It was exchanged for by everyone's blood, sweat, hardship, and struggle. Our regiment is a major merit regiment in the Liberation War, and we must also play the role of a major merit regiment in defending national defense.

　　Meng Xiangyou (Sixth Squad Soldier): For thousands of years in the past, the Chinese people have not had their own government. There have been many times when the people rose up in revolution, but they all failed. This time, with the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, we have the government of today, which is such a joyful thing! But this government did not come easily, so in the future, we must work harder to study and improve our military, political, and cultural skills. There are still imperialists in the world and remaining enemies in the country, so we must properly defend this government and let it build the country with peace of mind, turning an agricultural country into an industrial country.

　　“保卫咱的中央人民政府！”
    ——一个战士座谈会的纪录
    （萧泽林徐光耀纪录）
    一听到中国人民政协开幕的消息，驻在秦皇岛的人民解放军战士们，都一蹦三跳，高兴地说：“中国人民有了当家的了，我们可要努力练兵，建设正规化的国防军，好好保卫咱的中央人民政府！”五九八团三营——就是光荣当选政协大会主席团的特等功臣李国英的营——情绪尤其高涨。当接到他们李营长从北京的来信，报告他亲眼看见了毛主席、朱总司令，并和他们亲切地握了手时，战士们发出了热烈的欢呼，感到十分光荣；该营机炮连的战士们特召开了座谈会，会上都踊跃发言，争着说出自己的认识和感想。下面是这个座谈会的纪录摘要：
    姚殿屏（二排长）：我是打张家口时解放的，当时，对共产党认识很模糊，后来经过各种学习，才有了一些进步，特别是向太原进军中，见到沿途男女老少的热烈欢迎，我就感到国民党根本完了。打太原时我立了一小功，后来领导上批准我当排长。后来听说人民政治协商会议开幕，真是又高兴，又惭愧，惭愧的是自己参加革命太晚了，没有给新中国立下多大功，高兴的是我虽没有去参加开会，营长代表去了，这不光是解放军的光荣，也是我们全营全连每一个人的光荣。
    杨海泉（六班战士）：听到人民政协开幕了，心里的高兴呀，就是说也说不出来。从前，咱中国是半殖民地半封建的国家，尽受人欺侮和压迫，现在是人民自己的国家了，这才真正是独立民主统一的国家，因为这个政府是为人民办事的。我是太原才被解放的，日子不久，就赶上这样好的光景，我要用最大的努力，在保卫国防的任务下好好学习，争取立功入党，将革命进行到底！
    张士英（副政指）：人民政协、中央人民政府，这是我们几十年来艰苦奋斗的结果，也是好多革命烈士的鲜血、中国人民的血汗所培育出来的，我们必须好好的巩固它，保卫它。中国人民几千年以来，始终是在地下爬着，一抬脑袋就叫人打下去；现在中国人民翻身了，在世界上站起来了，我们在世界上能说话了，再也不受帝国主义的气了，不受反动派的气了。我要下定决心带领全连好好练兵，保护国防，防止帝国主义的捣乱！
    罗玉友（四班长、大功臣）：中国人民过去好象没有家的小孩子，到处受人欺侮，今年算是有了家了，这不但中国人民高兴，世界各国人民也都是兴奋的。
    毛庆春（一排副）：那天听到教导员讲：“人民政协开幕了！”我心就想：这可不简单，十年内战，八年抗战，三年解放战争，南征北战，到今天才建立了人民共和国的政府。但是，世界上还有帝国主义存在，我们还须要时刻准备着战斗，来保卫我们艰苦奋斗得来的果实。
    刘国成（五班副）：自从听说营长去参加政协会议，我就每天到连部去找报纸，盼着中央人民政府赶快出现，那天（二十二日）出操回来，看到“拥护人民政协开幕！”的标语，我心眼里就有说不出的高兴。过去在察南战役中吃的苦，真没白受啊！这是大伙流血、流汗、吃苦、奋斗所换来的。我们这一团在解放战争中是大功团，在保卫国防中我们也要起到大功团的作用。
    孟祥友（六班战士）：过去几千年中，中国人民就没有自己的政府，有好多次人民起来革命，可是都失败了，我们这次有毛主席共产党的领导，才有了今天的政府，这是一件多么高兴的大事情呀！但是这个政府来的是不容易的，所以今后我们更要加油努力学习，提高军事、政治、文化；世界上还有帝国主义、国内还有残余敌人，我们就要好好保卫这个政府，让这个政府安心建设国家，把农业国变成工业国。
