　　Launch the Struggle to Prevent Plague

The warning of the plague outbreak in northern Chahar, Inner Mongolia, has drawn widespread attention from various regions. The active struggle to prevent and eradicate the plague has already begun. This should become a current battle task for the people of North China.

According to statistics from Northeast China in 1947, the number of deaths caused by the plague greatly exceeded the total number of casualties in the entire year's Liberation War, and the economic losses were estimated at about 10 billion. Therefore, in order to protect the health of the people, to develop production and various construction undertakings, and to support the victory of the Liberation War throughout the country, we must actively prevent the plague, this fierce enemy. Currently, the plague has been discovered in Chahar, but to prevent and eradicate it, the efforts of a single local area of ​​Chahar Province will not be effective. The entire North China, Northeast China, and other relevant regions, especially the Party, government, army, and people of the capital Beijing and Tianjin, should work together to fight for the prevention and eradication of the plague!

Areas where the plague has already occurred should immediately strengthen epidemic prevention organizations, mobilize the masses, implement large-scale epidemic prevention measures, establish a system of early reporting, early isolation, strict blockade, thorough disinfection, thorough diagnosis, and close epidemic information sharing. Special emphasis should be placed on isolation and blockade methods. Past experience has proven that if isolation and blockade are not thorough, the plague will easily spread. Therefore, we must accept this experience and strictly implement blockade and isolation, so that the plague is limited to the currently occurring local areas and can be quickly eliminated. After establishing epidemic prevention agencies, the Party, government, army, and health departments should systematically mobilize all health personnel, provide them with short-term training in plague prevention and treatment, and extensively carry out publicity and education work to actively improve the public's epidemic prevention knowledge. The masses should be mobilized to catch rats and kill fleas, implement universal preventive vaccinations, strictly prohibit transportation to and from plague areas, prepare necessary medicines and equipment, and prepare for the battle of epidemic prevention.

Regions far from the plague outbreak should also strengthen publicity and education work, raise public awareness, and organize and plan various epidemic prevention facilities. More importantly, great efforts should be made to provide full support in manpower and materials to the plague-stricken areas, so as to complete the tasks of epidemic prevention and eradication as soon as possible.

The establishment of an epidemic prevention command is correct and necessary. Plague prevention and control is a mass work that requires the participation of the broad masses; the government should provide strong guidance from beginning to end. The experience of Northeast China in plague prevention and control over the past three years has been like this. Because Northeast China mobilized the masses, it created more than 70 kinds of rat-catching methods on the issue of rat-catching alone, and this year it has achieved the brilliant achievement of capturing more than 7 million rats, thus coordinating with other epidemic prevention work, so that the occurrence of the plague is only equal to two-hundredths of that in 1947. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government and other regions, because they attach importance to and lead this work administratively, have also made the plague no longer occur in the past two years. These experiences are worth learning from.

Although the plague is a highly contagious infectious disease with a high mortality rate, we should never panic because of this. As long as we carry out prevention and eradication in a timely, prepared, and organized manner, the plague can be completely overcome. Experience tells us that any region that panics and retreats in the work of plague prevention and control will result in the plague spreading even further; any region that takes the lead actively and vigorously prevents and controls the plague will quickly eliminate the plague. The main reason for panic and retreat is not understanding what the plague is, and only feeling that it is very terrible. If the people generally understand the methods of plague prevention and treatment, and know how to protect themselves, then the plague is not terrible. Among the thousands of people who have participated in plague prevention and control in Northeast China for the past three years, not a single staff member who knew how to prevent and control the plague has suffered a sacrifice. From this, it can be seen that the psychology of panic and fear is unfounded. As for superstitious and backward ideas, there should be no slightest accommodation to them; on the contrary, it is necessary to actively raise the awareness of the masses, break superstitious sayings such as "the plague god descends to earth," and superstitious practices such as praying to Buddha for incense and exorcising ghosts. The Northeast epidemic prevention leaders once had the painful experience of complying with the backward demands of the masses, allowing them to "perform plays to drive away the plague god," which resulted in the rapid spread of the plague due to mass gatherings, causing a greater disaster. This is absolutely not allowed to be repeated.

In carrying out epidemic prevention work, attention should also be paid not to simply emphasizing epidemic prevention, affecting production, disaster relief, and other central tasks, so as not to become detached from the masses; but also not to ignore the situation and emphasize production, disaster relief, or other central tasks, and affect epidemic prevention. This requires close contact between administrative personnel and technical personnel, and to decide on methods based on the specific situation to better complete this work task.

### 展开防止鼠疫的斗争

　　展开防止鼠疫的斗争
    内蒙察北鼠疫侵袭的警报，已引起了各地普遍的注意，积极防止和扑灭鼠疫的斗争已经展开了，这应该成为华北人民当前的一项战斗任务。
    根据东北地区一九四七年的统计，因鼠疫死亡的人数，大大的超过了全年解放战争的伤亡总数，经济损失，估计约达一百亿。因此，为了保障人民的健康，为了发展生产和各种建设事业，并支援解放战争在全国的胜利，对于鼠疫这个凶恶的敌人，必须积极预防。目前发现鼠疫的是察哈尔，但要防止和扑灭它，决不是察省一个局部地区所能收效，整个华北、东北及其他有关各地区，尤其是首都北京及天津的党政军民都应该共同努力，为防止和扑灭鼠疫而斗争！
    已经发生鼠疫的地区，应即加强防疫组织，动员群众，实行大规模的防疫措施，建立早期报告、早期隔离，严格封锁，彻底消毒，彻底诊察以及紧密的疫情通报制度。其中应特别强调隔离封锁的方法。过去经验证明，隔离封锁不彻底，鼠疫就易于蔓延，因此，我们要接受这个经验，严格执行封锁隔离，要使鼠疫只限于现在发生的局部地区，并能迅速予以消灭，党政军及卫生机关在建立了防疫机构之后，应有计划地动员所有的卫生人员，给以防治鼠疫的短期训练，并广泛进行宣传教育工作，积极提高群众的防疫知识。应发动群众，捕鼠灭蚤，普遍施行预防注射，严格禁止与鼠疫地区交通，准备必要的药品器材，做好防疫的战斗准备工作。
    距离发生鼠疫较远的地区，也应加强宣传教育工作，提高群众的认识，并有组织有计划地准备各种防疫设施。更重要的是要用大力给予发生鼠疫的地区以人力物力的充分支援，尽速完成防疫、灭疫的任务。
    成立防疫指挥部是正确而必要的。防治鼠疫是一个群众性的工作，需要广大的群众参加；政府应自始至终予以有力的指导。东北三年来防治鼠疫的经验就是这样的。东北因为发动了群众，单只在捕鼠问题上，创造了七十几种捕鼠的方法，今年就造成了捕获七百多万只老鼠的辉煌成绩，因而配合了其他各种防疫工作，使鼠疫的发生只等于一九四七年的二百分之一。内蒙自治政府及其他某些地区，因为在行政上重视并领导这一工作，也使得鼠疫在近两年来不再发生。这些经验，是值得我们学习的。
    鼠疫虽是一种传染极快、死亡率极大的传染病，但我们决不应当因此而惊慌失措。只要我们及时地有准备有组织地进行预防和扑灭，鼠疫是完全可以战胜的。经验告诉我们：哪一个地区在防治鼠疫的工作中惊慌退缩，结果就会使鼠疫更加扩大蔓延；哪一个地区积极带头，大力防治，结果就会很快地消灭鼠疫。惊慌退缩的原因，主要是不懂得鼠疫是什么，只觉得非常可怕，如果使人民普遍懂得对鼠疫防治的方法，懂得如何保护自己，那末鼠疫也就并不可怕了。东北三年来参加防治鼠疫的几千人中间，还没有一个懂得如何防治鼠疫的工作人员遭受了牺牲的。由此可见，惊慌恐惧的心理是没有根据的。至于迷信落后的思想更不应对它有丝毫迁就；相反地必须积极提高群众的认识，打破“瘟神下界”等迷信说法和求香拜佛、跳神驱鬼等迷信的做法。东北防疫领导人员曾有因顺从群众落后的要求，允许他们“唱戏退瘟神”而结果由于群众的集会，使鼠疫迅速传染，造成了更大灾难的痛苦经验，这是绝对不容许再重复的了。
    在进行防疫工作中，还应该注意，不要单纯强调防疫，影响了生产救灾及其他中心工作，以免脱离群众；但也不应不问情况，强调生产救灾或其他中心工作，而影响了防疫，这就要求行政人员与技术人员密切地联系，根据具体情况，决定办法更好地完成这个工作任务。
