　　Soviet Criticism of "Changes in Li Family Village"

　　Zhao Shuli's "Changes in Li Family Village" has recently received international acclaim. The Soviet magazine "New Times" published a book review titled "A Novel About the Chinese Countryside," with critics Svantov and Ukrainian-Jef. They introduced Zhao Shuli to the Soviet Union and the global cultural community (the "New Times" has several language versions), stating that he is a young writer from the liberated areas who has already authored the novels "Xiao Erhei's Marriage" and "Li Youcai Rhymes," and that "Changes in Li Family Village" is his recent successful work. The critics wrote:

　　"Zhao Shuli's new novel encompasses a wide range of issues. It vividly reflects the political, economic, and cultural developments in China over the past fifteen years. Its significance lies not only in its exposure of the reactionary essence of the Kuomintang rule and its expression of the great constructive capabilities of the Chinese Communist Party, but also in its profound depiction of the awakening of the Chinese people and the growth of their political activities. While reading, we gain a clear understanding of the formation process of the morality and thought of the people in democratic China.

　　"The author's intention is to enable readers to see and feel the real situation in China today with the help of this book, and we must say that this goal has been achieved. His novel makes the struggle and life of the Chinese people understandable to the reader. Zhao Shuli exposes the rumors fabricated by reactionary Western European 'experts,' who insist that the Chinese people have 'mystical characteristics,' are traditionally 'conservative,' 'naturally opposed to anything new,' and that the Chinese are forever inert. Now these distorted 'theories' have been swept away.

　　The critics then briefly introduced the story content of "Changes in Li Family Village." They said that Li Family Village is a typical rural village in Shanxi and also in China. The story begins three years before the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, when the poor peasant Zhang Tiesuo is oppressed by the landlord Li Ruzhen and is finally forced to leave and wander. Through various hardships, he meets the young Communist Party member Xiao Chang, who enlightened his thinking. Xiao Chang instructs him on the path for Chinese peasants to liberate themselves from poverty and oppression. After Xiao Chang is arrested and imprisoned, Zhang Tiesuo understands even more why the reactionary Kuomintang government persecuted Communists, because Communists told the people the truth. Zhang Tiesuo returned to his hometown and mobilized the peasants not to participate in the anti-communist security corps. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, he and other poor peasants, Leng Yuan, Bai Gou, etc., participated in the anti-Japanese work. At this time, Xiao Chang also returned from prison to lead the peasant masses to fight against the Japanese invaders and local tyrants.

　　The critics continued:

　　"The author of the novel shows how trampled and uneducated peasants gradually grow into intelligent and confident men and women. In the complex process of the revolutionary struggle to liberate China, Chinese peasants have created their new character. Zhao Shuli's novel powerfully refutes the lies currently spread by foreign reactionaries, that is, that the Chinese people's democracy is a fantasy. The facts are to the contrary: Chinese democracy has firmly taken root among the masses and has won the support of the entire people. Undoubtedly, the most successful chapters are those describing how democracy developed in the villages. It shows how various democratic policies were implemented in the areas ruled by the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, and how the peasants supported the People's Liberation Army. And they are determined to sacrifice themselves to defend this fruit of democracy. The Kuomintang reactionary army, even with the support of American arms and American training, cannot withstand the overwhelming blow of the People's Liberation Army." Finally, the critics said, "Zhao Shuli's novel is equally faithful in its depiction of China's past history and present situation. It uses literature as a tool to reproduce the changes in China over the past fifteen years. This is a story of the Chinese people, which reflects their selfless, day-to-day struggle. This book has great power, and its significance is rich." (Wang Jin)

### 苏联对“李家庄的变迁”的批评

　　苏联对“李家庄的变迁”的批评
    赵树理的“李家庄的变迁”最近获得了国际的好评。苏联“新时代”杂志有一篇“关于中国乡村的小说”的书评，批评者为斯凡特洛夫和乌克兰节夫。他们向苏联以及全世界的文化界（“新时代”有好几种语文版本）介绍了赵树理，说他是一位已经著作过“小二黑结婚”和“李有才板话”两本小说的解放区青年作家，而“李家庄的变迁”是他最近的成功作品。批评者这样写道：
    “赵树理的新作小说包括广泛的各种问题。它生动地反映了最近十五年来中国的政治、经济和文化的发展。其意义不单在于它暴露了国民党统治的反动的本质，表达了中国共产党的伟大的建设能力，并且十分深刻地刻划了中国人民的觉醒和他们的政治活动的成长。我们在阅读的时候，对民主中国人民的道德、思想的形成过程，获得了清楚的了解。
    “作者的企图是使读者借本书之助，能够看到并且感觉到今天中国的实在情况，我们必须这样说，他的这一目的是达到了。他的小说使中国人民的斗争与生活成为读者所能够了解的东西。赵树理拆穿了西欧反动的“专家”们所捏造的谣言，他们硬说中国人民具有“神秘特性”，传统上一直是“保守”的，“天性地反对任何新事物”的，并硬说中国人永远是惰性的。现在这些歪曲事实的“理论”是扫地了。
    批评者随后就扼要地介绍了“李家庄的变迁”的故事内容。他们说，李家庄是一个山西的也是中国的典型农村。故事开始在抗战爆发前三年，故事的主人公贫农张铁锁受到地主李如珍的压迫，终于被逼走，到外面去流浪。在种种艰难困苦的遭遇下，他遇到了启发他思想的青年共产党员小常。小常指示他中国农民应该怎样从贫穷压迫下解放出来的道路。等到小常被捕下狱后，张铁锁更明白了国民党反动政府为什么迫害共产党人的道理，那是由于共产党人把真理告诉了人民。张铁锁回到本乡就发动农民不去参加防共保卫团。抗战爆发后他和其他贫农冷元、白狗等参加了抗日工作，此时小常亦出狱回来领导农民大众向日寇和地主恶霸战斗。
    批评者继续写道：
    “小说的作者表现了受践踏的、知识低的农民怎样逐渐成长为聪明的自信的男性和女性。在解放中国的革命斗争的复杂过程中，中国农民怎样造成了他们的新的性格。赵树理的小说有力地驳斥了目前流行在外国的反动派所制造的谰言，那就是说中国的人民民主政治是空想的。事实则相反，中国的民主已经在人民大众中牢固地扎下根，获得了全人民的拥护。无疑的，最成功的几章是描写村庄中的民主政治如何发展。它显示出在八路军和新四军统治下的地区，怎样推行了种种民主政策，农民们如何拥护人民解放军。而且他们决不惜自我牺牲来保卫这民主的果实。国民党反动军队虽则依靠了美国军火和美国训练，也经不起人民解放军的摧枯拉朽的打击。”最后，批评者说，“赵树理的小说对中国过去的历史和目前的情势是同样忠实地描写着的。它以文学为工具，再现了中国近十五年来的变化。这是一部中国人民的故事，这故事反映了他们的无私的逐日进行着的斗争。这书具有极大的力量，它的意义是丰富的。”　　　（王进）
