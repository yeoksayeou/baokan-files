Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 9th: For a week, the people of Shanghai have been celebrating the birth of the new China. On the 2nd, after the all-circles celebration of the establishment of the Central People's Government and the support of the World Peace Conference held at the Racecourse despite the rain, various institutions, organizations, factories, schools, and people from all walks of life held celebrations, parades, and various recreational performances such as singing and dancing. National flags fluttered in the streets, and colorful signs stood tall. Workers at the Shanghai Electric Power Company, in particular, imitated the style of Qianmen in Beijing and built a majestic paifang (decorated archway) at the intersection of Nanjing Road, reaching a height of 28 feet, a width of 56 feet, and a thickness of 6 feet. On the skyscraper of the International Hotel, two banners of red cloth with white characters, each over ten feet long, hung down like waterfalls: "Long Live the People's Republic of China" and "Support World Peace," each character measuring ten feet square. Although it had been raining for days, the enthusiasm of the masses did not diminish. The streets were crowded with people all day long, with gongs and drums beating and firecrackers exploding everywhere, and singing and cheers merged into one. Parades, yangko teams, waist drum teams, and others were constantly flowing. On the 3rd, despite the rain, the parade reached hundreds of thousands of people, and an average of one parade team passed through the Tilanqiao area of the Suzhou River every ten minutes. At night, more than 20,000 employees of various industries and customs employees held a torch parade along the Bund, and the lights illuminated the Huangpu River. After the news of the Soviet Union's recognition of the new China spread, the people of the city were even more ecstatic, with applause and cheers everywhere. On the 4th, more than 2,500 people from Shanghai's theatrical circles held a celebration meeting, followed by a parade and various exciting performances. The 6th coincided with the Mid-Autumn Festival, and the city was even more lively. More than 30,000 pedicab and rickshaw workers, riding on more than 10,000 pedicabs, held a grand celebration parade. The sound of gongs and drums and firecrackers continued late into the night.
