Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 25th: The Central Finance and Economics Committee, in order to understand the work situation of customs across the country and prepare for the establishment of a new General Administration of Customs, convened a symposium from September 23rd to October 16th, attended by 36 representatives of customs personnel from across the country.

At the opening, the meeting's host, Kong Yuan, explained in detail that the purpose of the meeting was to understand the situation, exchange experiences, discuss the guiding principles and tasks of the people's customs work in the future, prepare for the establishment of new central customs organizations, and enable representatives from various regions to learn from each other, recognize each other, and connect with each other. In addition to reporting, the following issues were to be discussed: (1) the guiding principles, tasks, and scope of business of the people's customs work; (2) the organizational structure and leadership system of customs across the country; (3) the tasks and draft organizational regulations of the new General Administration of Customs; (4) Several customs administrative and business issues, such as inspection and collection, tariff rules, investigation, maritime affairs, statistics, and personnel.

In the work reports, representatives from customs in Northeast China, Lushun-Dalian, Shandong, and other regions reported on how, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, they researched a new set of customs organizational structures, personnel systems, tariff rules and rates, and import and export cargo management methods in the arduous environment of the Anti-Japanese War and the War of Self-Defense, and pointed out that the practice of economic struggle against the enemy proved its correctness. Representatives from customs in newly liberated areas such as Tianjin, Shanghai, and Hankou introduced the old customs' methods and the situation of takeover and preliminary transformation after liberation. Representatives from customs in areas awaiting liberation, such as Kowloon, reported on the corruption and decadence of customs under imperialist reactionary rule. From these reports of various situations, on the one hand, representatives from old liberated areas felt that, due to the transition from war to peaceful construction, from remote and scattered villages to complex and concentrated cities, the relatively simple systems and methods of the past needed to be enriched and improved. On the other hand, personnel from the old customs in newly liberated areas deeply realized that many old regulations and systems were completely in the service of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and it was necessary to reconsider and transform them today. In addition, everyone believed that unified leadership, unified tariff rules and rates, and unified port management were issues that must be resolved to carry out work.

Following this, the meeting divided into groups to discuss five specialized issues: organization, personnel system, tariff inspection and collection, investigation, and maritime and port affairs. First, regional groups discussed and raised questions, and then representatives from various regions were mixed into groups to conduct in-depth discussions according to the questions. The organization group discussed the tasks and guiding principles of the new customs and the draft organizational regulations. The personnel system group studied issues such as personnel establishment and allocation, the unity of new and old cadres, and salary levels. The tariff inspection and collection group exchanged views on unifying tariff rules and rates and revising the old customs' regulations on the management of import and export goods. The investigation group put forward opinions on drafting new anti-smuggling regulations and unified inspection. The maritime and port affairs group discussed whether and how maritime and port affairs work should be managed by customs.

During the group discussions, a Soviet customs work expert, Klieflishnieh, was invited to the meeting to report on the organization and tasks of Soviet customs, giving the attendees important insights. Chen Yun, Director of the Central Finance and Economics Committee, also personally attended the meeting and gave the following instructions: (1) It is a fundamental and major change to transform the customs, which has been controlled by imperialism for a century, into a customs that serves the people, is completely independent, and is beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood of the New Democracy. However, in the transformation, prudent and cautious steps should be taken. Things in the old customs that are useful to the New Democracy, such as organizational techniques and experience, should be accepted. (2) The relationship between the new customs and foreign trade is very close. The People's Government, based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit, is willing to restore and develop trade relations with the governments and people of all countries, and first of all, to trade with the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries. (3) The current disunity in customs management is a temporary phenomenon and will gradually move towards unification. (4) New and old cadres must unite and work together to build a new customs.

After the reports and thematic discussions, each group submitted written reports and proposals as a reference for building the new customs. The meeting concluded with two days of discussion on the tasks and organization of the new General Administration of Customs and drafted the organizational regulations of the new customs. At the closing ceremony, Kong Yuan, based on the situation and problems discovered at the meeting, emphasized the following issues: (1) The historical transformation of customs is not a piecemeal change but a fundamental change, a revolution. Because of the victory of the Chinese people, it is possible to realize this transformation today. The task before us is how to implement cautious reforms in all aspects of the old customs, which were controlled by imperialism and served imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, to make it a customs that serves the people of the New China. Therefore, we must clarify this issue ideologically and in principle. Our direction should basically be the same as that of the Soviet customs, and we should attach importance to the experience of the Soviet customs. (2) The tasks of customs can be roughly divided into three parts: A, protecting legitimate foreign trade of public and private sectors, and cooperating with other government departments to ensure the implementation of foreign trade control policies; B, collecting tariffs in accordance with correct tariff policies; C, handling various customs businesses, such as anti-smuggling, maritime affairs, and other matters stipulated by the central government agencies. Organizationally, we should study how to move from decentralization to unification. Some of the past organizational methods are still useful today and should be adopted. (3) The old personnel system is a systematic, vicious, cunning, and sophisticated method used by imperialism to rule colonies, and it must be fundamentally negated and criticized. The personnel system of the old liberated areas' customs has not yet been fundamentally established, but many experiences and methods can be used for reference. In the future, cadres in the old liberated areas should focus on improving their cultural level and professional knowledge, and cadres in the newly liberated areas should pay special attention to improving their political understanding, transforming their thinking, and establishing the concept of serving the people. Most of the old customs personnel should be retained, but appropriate and necessary reforms should be implemented in the personnel system. In terms of salary, the current living standards of the majority of the people and the financial difficulties of the government should be taken into account. (4) This symposium is a preparatory meeting for building the new Chinese customs, making ideological and organizational preparations for building a new unified customs. This meeting was successful. It not only helped the Central Finance and Economics Committee understand the situation but also helped the representatives who attended the meeting.

Before the closing ceremony, Mr. Ding Guitang from the old General Administration of Customs made a speech, stating: "It is a fact that customs has been ruled by imperialism and served the four major families for a century. I can frankly admit this on behalf of the old employees. The benefits we have gained in these twenty days of meetings are more than the benefits of studying in Shanghai for several months, making the old customs personnel aware that they are still carrying a considerable burden." Regarding the customs personnel in the old liberated areas, Mr. Ding said: "You said that you built the customs using local methods, but I say that it is a new method, not a local method. To be honest, we used to think that customs affairs could not be handled without us, but now we know that they can still be handled without the old customs personnel."

    举行海关人员代表座谈会            
    苏联专家报告苏联海关的组织与任务陈云主任指示努力建设人民的新海关
    【新华社北京二十五日电】中央财政经济委员会为了了解全国各地海关工作情况，并筹备成立新海关总署，在九月二十三日至十月十六日召集了全国各地海关工作人员代表三十六人举行座谈会。
    开幕时，会议主持人孔原，详细地说明了会议召开的目的是了解情况，交换经验，商谈今后人民海关工作的方针任务，准备建立新的中央海关组织机构并使到会各地代表能借以互相学习、互相认识及互相联系。除汇报外，规定研讨下列问题：（一）人民海关工作的方针任务和业务范围；（二）全国海关组织机构及领导系统；（三）新中央海关总署的任务及组织条例草案；（四）若干海关行政的与业务的问题，如验征、税则、查缉、海务、统计及人事等。
    在工作汇报中，东北、旅大、山东等海关的代表报告了在抗日战争及自卫战争的艰苦环境中怎样在中国共产党领导下研究出一套新的海关组织机构、人事制度、税则税率及进出口货物管理等办法，并指出在对敌经济斗争的实践中证明了它的正确性。新解放区的天津、上海、汉口等海关代表的报告中，介绍了旧海关的一套办法，及解放后接管及初步改造的情况。待解放区的九龙等海关代表，报告了在帝国主义反动统治下海关中的贪污腐败的实况。从这各种不同情况的报告中，一方面使老解放区代表感觉到由于从战争到和平建设，从偏僻分散的乡村到复杂集中的城市，过去比较简单的制度办法有加以充实、提高的必要。另一方面，使新解放区旧海关人员深切体会到许多旧的章则制度完全是为帝国主义、封建主义及官僚资本主义服务的，今天有加以重新考虑及改造之必要。此外，大家都认为统一领导、统一税则税率、统一港口管理等是开展工作所必须解决的问题。
    接着，会议即分组讨论五个专门问题：组织、人事制度、税则验征、查缉及海务港务。先由各地区小组讨论并提出问题，然后各地代表按照问题混合编组深入讨论，组织小组讨论了新海关的任务方针及组织条例草案等问题，人事制度小组研究了人员编制配备新老干部的团结及薪津职级等问题，税则验征小组交换了关于统一税则税率，及修改旧海关管理进出口货物章则等问题，查缉小组提出了关于拟订新缉私条例及统一检查等问题的意见，海务港务小组研讨了关于海务港务工作应否及如何由海关管理等问题。
    在小组讨论过程中，曾请苏联海关工作专家克里夫立什内赫莅会报告苏联海关的组织与任务，给到会人员以重要的启示。中央财经委会主任陈云也亲临会场，作了下列的指示：（一）把百年来帝国主义所把持的海关，变为为人民服务的、完全自主的、有利于新民主主义国计民生的海关，是带根本性的大变革。但在变革中应采取稳重审慎的步骤。应当把旧海关内对新民主主义有用的东西，如组织技术，经验等接受过来。（二）新的海关与对外贸易的关系是很密切的。人民政府在平等互利的原则下，愿与各国政府及人民恢复和发展通商关系，首先要同苏联及新民主主义国家做交易。（三）海关管理上目前的不统一是暂时的现象，要逐渐走向统一。（四）新老干部必须团结，共同为建设新海关而努力。
    汇报及专题讨论结束后，各小组均作就书面报告与各项提议，以作为建设新海关之参考。会议最后举行了两天关于新海关总署的任务与组织的讨论，并起草新海关的组织条例。在闭幕时，孔原根据会议的情形和发现的问题，着重说明了以下几个问题：（一）海关的历史大变革，不是枝枝节节的而是根本性的变革，是一个革命。因为中国人民的胜利，今天才有可能来实现这变革。摆在我们面前的任务就是怎样把旧的、掌握在帝国主义手中为帝国主义、封建主义与官僚资本主义服务的海关，实行各方面的慎重的改革，使成为新中国的为人民服务的海关，因此我们必须在思想上、原则上，弄清楚这一问题。我们的方向基本上应与苏联的海关相同，我们应重视苏联海关的经验。（二）海关的任务大体可分为三部分：甲、保护公私合法对外贸易，协同政府其他部门保证实行对外贸易管制政策；乙、根据正确的关税政策征收关税；丙、办理各项海关业务，如缉私、海务、及中央政府机关规定的其他事项。组织上应研究怎样由分散到统一。过去的组织办法，有些今天仍有用，应当采取。（三）旧的人事制度是帝国主义统治殖民地的一套有系统的凶恶狡猾而精细的办法，必须从根本上予以否定，予以批判。老解放区海关的人事制度尚未根本地树立起来，但许多经验办法可供参考。今后老解放区干部应着重提高文化水平及业务知识，新解放区干部应特别注意提高政治认识，改造思想，树立为人民服务的观点。旧海关人员大部分应留用，但人事制度应该实行适当的必要的改革。薪金方面应照顾目前大多数人民的生活水准与政府的财政困难。（四）此次座谈会是建设新中国海关的准备会议，为建设新的统一的海关作思想上及组织上的准备。这次会议是有成绩的。不但帮助了中央财经委员会了解情况，也帮助了到会的各代表。
    在闭幕前旧海关总署丁贵堂先生发表谈话，略称：“海关百年来受帝国主义统治、为四大家族服务，这是事实，本人可以代表老职员坦白地承认。我们在这二十天会里，比在上海学习几个月的益处还要多，使老海关人员知道了自己身上还背着相当重的包袱。”对老解放区海关工作人员，丁先生称：“你们说是用土法建设了海关，我说是新法，不是土法。真诚坦白地说，我们早先以为海关的事没有我们就办不了，现在我们知道没有老海关人员也照样能办。”
