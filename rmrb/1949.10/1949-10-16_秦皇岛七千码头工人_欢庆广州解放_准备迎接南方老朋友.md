　　Qin Huangdao's Seven Thousand Dockworkers
  　Celebrate the Liberation of Guangzhou
  　Preparing to Welcome Old Friends from the South
    [Our Newspaper Correspondent, Qin Huangdao, 15th dispatch] Upon hearing the news of Guangzhou's liberation, the seven thousand Kailuan dockworkers in Qin Huangdao were overjoyed. The trade union immediately broadcasted the news through loudspeakers, ensuring that workers in all workshops, dormitories, docks, and ships were informed immediately. Director Fu Qingyu said: "We have driven away the American imperialist running dog Chiang Kai-shek from the last major seaport in China. From now on, he will no longer have any major ports. Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang is completely finished!" Young worker Chen Zhongliang said: "This time, ships from Southeast Asia will be able to arrive even faster. The sailors and 'foremen' can meet with many old acquaintances and old friends. We have long been preparing to welcome and entertain them well. How happy everyone will be when they meet!" He also said: "Our docks have been built even better than before. The boss has replaced them with new planks. The Shunping and Junping have been digging the docks very deep and flat these days. The coal yard workers have also replaced the new planks. The ship welcoming signal flags have also been replaced with new ones. That day when we had a meeting, everyone said that even if seven or eight ships come together, we will definitely load them on time." Speaking of this, he was extremely happy and said: "From now on, sailors and workers from the north and south can work together again. Tomorrow we will hold a meeting to discuss and definitely celebrate the liberation of this major seaport in China well." He, representing the seven thousand dockworkers, issued a victorious smile.

　　秦皇岛七千码头工人
  　欢庆广州解放
  　准备迎接南方老朋友
    【本报记者秦皇岛十五日专电】听到广州解放的消息，秦皇岛七千开滦码头工人高兴极了，职工会立刻就用扩音器广播起来，让各工房、宿舍、码头、船上的工人都立刻知道。主任傅庆余说：“我们从中国最后一个大海口上，把美帝国主义走狗蒋介石赶跑，从此他再也没有大口岸了。蒋介石国民党是彻底完蛋啦！”青年工友陈忠良说：“这次南洋的船只就能够更快的来了，水手们、‘福尔曼’们可以和许多老熟人老朋友们会会面了。我们早就准备好好欢迎和招待他们，大家见了面该是多么高兴啊！”他又说：“咱们码头上已经修筑的比已往更好了，老板换了新板，顺平号、浚平号这些天来已经把码头挖的很深很平，煤厂工人们也已经换了新板，迎船信号旗也换了新的，那天我们开会时，大家就说今后就是一齐来个七只八只船，我们也一定按时装上。”说到这里他高兴极了，说：“从此南北的水手们工人们又可以一起工作了。明天我们就开会讨论，一定好好庆祝中国这一个大海口的解放。”他代表着七千码头工人发出胜利的微笑。
