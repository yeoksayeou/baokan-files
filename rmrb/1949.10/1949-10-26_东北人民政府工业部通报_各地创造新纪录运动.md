　　Northeast People's Government Industry Department's Circular
　　New Record Creation Movement in Various Regions

　　[Our newspaper's dispatch] The Northeast People's Government Industry Department issued a circular on October 19 regarding the creation of new records, stating:

　　1. Since the Northeast Bureau and the Ministry's "Instructions on Continuing to Implement the Economic Accounting System" (see this newspaper on October 14) and the "Decision on Launching a Mass Movement to Create New Production Records" (see this newspaper on October 15) were announced, this movement is gradually unfolding. In the movement, various regions have created different methods to organize the broad masses of workers and staff to create new records and combat waste. The methods adopted by various regions are now summarized and circulated as follows:

　　(1) Discover and cultivate advanced workers' new records, promptly commend and reward them, introduce their experiences, and call on all workers and staff to learn from them. Extend the new records of one person or one machine to all members of the group, the entire shift, or even the entire factory's workers and staff to create new records. There are not only new records for improving production efficiency, but also new records in all aspects such as improving quality, reducing waste, and saving raw materials. Thus, administrative leadership, combined with mass movements, researches and improves our management system and management methods. The discovery of advanced producers such as Zhao Guoyou and Zhao Fuyou, and the new record creation movement in the First and Third Machinery Factories, are developing in this way.

　　Administrative Trade Union Closely Cooperates

　　(2) The administration proposes a total target for the entire factory. Cooperating with the Party and the Trade Union to call on and organize all workers and staff to create new records to achieve this total target. For example, the Anshan Steel Plant originally produced only about 5,000 tons of steel per furnace per month, with very low efficiency. To improve this, the gas furnace, crane, and repair work often did not coordinate well. Later, the leadership repeatedly researched with the workers and staff and proposed to create a new record of exceeding 5,500 tons in October, while ensuring that 80% of the quality met the standards. Rewards were given according to the size of the new record. Under this call, the open hearth furnace crew, gas crew, crane crew, and repair crew all made demands and guarantees to each other, agreed to supervise and inspect each other, and have begun to create a new record of smelting a furnace of steel in 5.15 minutes (previously it took about 10 hours to produce a furnace, or 48 hours to produce five furnaces). Another example is the Third Machinery Factory, which produced 30 lathes in August and requested 40 in September. As a result, the workers created a new record of 45 lathes. The predetermined target of this overall production new record was handed over to all workers and staff for discussion, divided into shifts and groups, to study how to create production new records for each shift and group to ensure the completion of this overall goal - the new production record of the entire factory.

　　Leading Cadres Personally Take the Lead in Breaking Through a Point

　　(3) Leading cadres personally take the lead in breaking through a point to promote the overall situation. For example, Xu Hongwen, Deputy Manager of Benxi Coal and Iron Company, personally led engineers, technicians, and section chiefs to the rock tunnel on-site, and conducted practical tests based on theoretical research and past experience summaries on issues such as drilling angle, depth, mutual distance, and amount of explosives. Practical examples were used to break down various doubts and obstacles. After averaging more than ten experiments, the result was 147% higher than the pseudo-Manchu per-worker efficiency (0.36 cubic meters), and 51% higher than the total average efficiency in April, May, and June of this year (0.588 cubic meters), reaching a new record of an average per-worker efficiency of 0.89 cubic meters, and also saving a lot of explosives, detonators, and fuses. The total savings per meter advanced were 915,000 yuan compared to May and June (saving 366.6 million yuan in costs if advancing 400 meters in a month). This new record has greatly promoted various units of the company.

　　(4) Commend the new records of advanced parts of the enterprise to promote weak and backward links, call on and organize them to catch up with advanced units, so that the entire enterprise can operate in coordination and cooperate with each other to achieve certain goals. For example, the Fifth Machinery Factory had a lot of work for milling machines, which did not coordinate well with other production. A call was made to catch up, and rewards were given immediately. The milling machine workers immediately held a meeting to find a way to solve the shortage of machines by changing to a three-shift system. In order to overcome the shortage of skilled workers, Xiao Jingming proposed that one person look after three spiral milling machines, and the phenomenon of milling workers not being able to keep up has now been overcome. This method can break through the weak link.

　　Adopting Various Different Methods According to the Different Characteristics of Each Factory and Mine

　　To carry out the new record movement, various different methods must be adopted according to the characteristics of each factory and mine. Moreover, several methods can be used simultaneously in the same factory and mine. Only in this way can all workers and staff of various natures be attracted to the movement. The methods we have discovered are still very few, so the movement is not yet very extensive, and some factories and mines of some bureaus have not yet started. We must create many new methods to promote and organize this movement to move towards comprehensiveness and depth, so that the movement is more extensive. Each factory and mine must summarize experience and report to us at any time.

　　2. Timely rewards are one of the important ways to promote the new record movement. Experience in various regions has proven that only timely rewards (not mechanically stipulating a reward once a month, but immediately studying all aspects of its achievements when discovered, such as quantity, quality, reasons, etc., and making a conclusion and giving rewards immediately) can continuously push the movement forward and enable the movement to persist.

　　Timely Rewards Promote Movement

　　3. At present, the new record movement mostly focuses on individual creations or increases in quantity (of course, this is very important), but there are not enough new records in areas such as reducing waste products, improving quality, saving raw materials, and collective new records. It is hoped that all units will pay attention to discovery and report to the Ministry temporarily. The Ministry will reward those with greater achievements.

　　Strengthen Leadership and Implement Concretely

　　4. Implement the economic accounting system. The new record creation movement is the central task of all factories and mines under the Industry Department at present. All units must strengthen the leadership of this work and not stay at general calls and mobilizations. Concrete steps and concrete methods must be taken in the organization to implement it. What is particularly important to note is that some factories and mines have not yet seriously arranged and led this work, which is not allowed and must be mobilized and specifically arranged immediately. In order to exchange experience, it is specifically stipulated that each factory and mine must report to the Ministry on the situation and experience of this movement every week from now on, writing one item if there is one. The first report should briefly explain: how each factory and mine mobilized and arranged, the emotions of cadres and workers, the list of new record creators (individual or collective) that have been discovered, their deeds and reasons, how they were rewarded, and how to promote organization, etc., and what experience, problems, and biases are there in factories and mines that have already launched new records.

　　5. In order to truly form a broad mass movement for creating new records, in order to organize our hundreds of thousands of workers, technicians, and all personnel into the high tide of economic construction, and to allow this movement to move forward with sufficient time, it is decided to postpone the completion of the new quota standard formulation to late December, so that each factory and mine can concentrate its efforts to lead this movement.

　　东北人民政府工业部通报　
    各地创造新纪录运动
    【本报讯】东北人民政府工业部于十月十九日发出关于创造新纪录的通报称：
    一、自东北局及本部“关于继续贯彻经济核算制指示”（见十月十四日本报）与“开展群众性创造生产新纪录的决定”（见十月十五日本报）公布后，这一运动正在逐渐开展中。在运动中各地已创造了各种不同的方法，去组织广大职工群众，创造新纪录，开展反浪费。现在把各地采用方法归纳通报如下：
    （一）发现和培养先进工友的新纪录，及时的表扬奖励，介绍其经验，号召全体工友向他学习。由一个人、一台机器的新纪录推广到全组，全班甚至全厂工友创造新纪录。不仅有提高生产效率的新纪录，而且有提高质量，减少废品，节约原材料等各方面的新纪录。从而行政领导上结合群众运动，研究和改进我们的管理制度和管理方法。如赵国有、赵富有等先进生产者的被发现和机械一厂三厂的创新纪录运动，就是这样开展起来的。
    行政工会密切配合
    （二）由行政上提出全厂总目标。配合党与工会号召和组织全体工友为达到这一总目标而创造新纪录。如鞍山炼钢厂，原来每炉每月产钢仅五千吨左右，效率很低，如要提高，则煤气炉，吊车，修理往往配合不好。后来领导上反复和职工研究，提出十月份在保证百分之八十质量合规格的条件下，创造超过五千五百吨的新纪录。并按新的纪录大小，给予奖励。在此号召下，平炉班、煤气班、吊车班、修理班，都互相提出要求和保证，约定互相督促检查，并已开始创造了五点十五分钟炼好一炉钢的新纪录（过去约十小时出一炉，或四十八小时出五炉）。又如机械三厂，八月生产车床三十台，九月要求四十台，结果工人创造了四十五台车床的新纪录。把这个总的生产新纪录的预定目标交给全体职工讨论，分班、组，研究如何创造各班、组的生产新纪录，以保证这一总目标——全厂生产新纪录的完成。
    领导干部亲自带头突破一点
    （三）领导干部亲自带头突破一点，推动全盘，如本溪煤铁公司副经理徐宏文同志亲自领导工程师，技师，科股长分班到岩石坑道坑内现场，根据打眼斜度，深度，互相距离，炮药量等问题的理论研究及过去经验总结又进行实际试验。用实际的例子打破了各种怀疑和阻碍。经过十几次试验的平均结果，比伪满的每工能率（○·三六立方米）提高百分之一百四十七，比本年四、五、六月份的总平均能率（○·五八八立方米）提高百分之五十一，而达到每工平均能率○·八九立方米的新纪录，而炮药、雷管、引火线也节省很多，总计每前进一米则比五、六月间节省九十一万五千元（全月如进四百米道就节省三亿六千六百万元成本）。这个新纪录对该公司各单位起了很大推动作用。
    （四）表扬企业中先进部分的新纪录，以推动薄弱与落后环节，号召和组织他们赶上先进单位，以便全企业协同动作，互相配合达到一定的目标，如机械五厂，因铣床的活多，和其他生产配合不好，即提出号召，赶上了即予奖励，铣床工人即全体开会想办法，为了解决机器不够改三班制，为了克服技术工人少的困难，萧景铭即提出一个人看三台螺旋铣床，现在已经克服了铣工赶不上的现象。这种方法可以突破薄弱的一环。
    根据各厂矿不同特点采取各种不同方法
    开展新纪录运动，必须根据各厂矿的特点，采取各种不同的方法。而且在同一个厂矿中也可以同时采用几种方法。只有这样，才能把各种性质不同的全体职工吸引到运动中来。现在我们所发现的方法还是很少，因此运动还不十分广泛，有些局的厂矿还未开展起来。我们要创造很多新的方法去推动与组织这一运动走向全面与深入，使运动更加广泛。各厂矿必须随时总结经验报告我们。
    二、及时进行奖励，这是推进新纪录运动的重要办法之一。各地经验证明，只有及时的奖励（不是机械规定一个月奖一次而是发现了即马上研究其成绩的各方面，如数量、质量、原因等，作出结论即予奖励）才能不断的将运动推向前去，使运动能够坚持下去。
    及时奖励推进运动
    三、目前新纪录运动，多数还是个人的创造或数量的增加（当然这个是很重要的），但在减少废品、提高质量、节约原材料及集体的新纪录等方面的新纪录还不够多，希望各单位注意发现，临时报告本部。有较大成绩者由本部给奖。
    加强领导具体贯彻
    四、贯彻经济核算制。创造新纪录运动，是目前工业部所属各厂矿的中心工作，各单位必须加强对这一工作的领导，不要停留在一般的号召和动员上，在组织上必须采取具体步骤，具体方法来贯彻。特别要注意的是有一部分厂矿至今仍未认真布置与领导，这是不能允许的，必须立即进行动员与具体布置。为交流经验，特规定各厂矿自现在起，每星期必须将各厂矿关于这一运动的情况和经验报告本部，有一条就写一条。第一次报告要简单说明：各厂矿如何动员布置的，干部、职工情绪如何，已发现的新纪录者（个人或集体）名单，事迹及原因，如何奖励的，及如何推动组织等，在已开展了新纪录的厂矿有何经验，问题及偏向等。
    五、为了使创造新纪录运动真正形成广泛的群众性的运动，为了把我们几十万职工，技术人员，全体组织到经济建设的高潮中来，使这一运动有充分的时间向前推进，决定将新的定额标准制定推迟到十二月下旬完成，以便各厂矿能集中力量领导这一运动。
