[Beijing News] The joint operation of the sausage casing processing and manufacturing industry in Beijing has increased both output and quality, but there are still shortcomings in the operation that need to be improved. This industry is mostly a family handicraft industry, with a very small scale, and most of them have financial difficulties and stagnant production. Since the 11th of last month, a joint operation method has been adopted, forming the "Sausage Casing Processing Joint Industrial Cooperative," concentrating production in one place. Sixty-two households participated, accounting for 90% of the city's industry. The capital is raised by all shareholders, with 10,000 yuan per share. Most shareholders participate in labor, and ten cooperative committee members are elected to serve as managers, accountants, and factory managers. A half-month is a period, and the distribution of net profit is 10% for bonuses (awarded to those who participate in labor), 40% for dividends, and 50% for public accumulation fund. In the first period, there were 399 shares, with a dividend of 3,600 yuan per share. In the second period, 93 new shares were added, and the output increased by about 50% compared with the first period. The dividend for old shares was 3,985 yuan per share, and the dividend for new shares was 2,715 yuan per share. By the 16th of this month, 112 new shares were added in the third period, with a total of 605 shares subscribed before and after. It is expected that the output can still be increased. In the past, when producing independently, each household had only one or two workers, and there was no strict division of labor. Now, 53 workers are concentrated, learning from each other's strengths, and dividing into six departments: purchasing, sorting, scraping intestines, filling intestines, tying bundles, and anti-corrosion. They supervise each other, improve technology, and improve quality, striving to make the casing watertight after production. The households have deeply realized that joint operation can increase production, reduce competition among the industry, and reduce the exploitation of exporters. In the past, when there was a lack of funds, they borrowed from exporters, and the exporters set the price after the finished product was made, so they could not be independent. The average profit was less than 10%. Since the joint operation, the exploitation has been reduced, and the average profit has reached 30%. In order to further develop, some operating methods and shareholder thinking still need to be corrected. The first is that dividends are distributed every half month, which affects the expansion of production and makes calculations troublesome. The dividend period should be extended as much as possible, or the proportion of public accumulation funds in net profit should be increased. Secondly, shareholders with production skills should participate in labor, and the few shareholders who have ideological concerns and lack sincerity in cooperation, such as those who are unwilling to absorb more funds to expand production, should be overcome. The output of this industry can be exported in full, and a large amount of capital needs to be absorbed to collect raw materials extensively in the northwest and other places to expand production.

　　有效提高手工业　
    京肠衣业联营　
    产品质量提高盈利增加       
    分红期短等缺点待克服
    【北京讯】京市肠衣加工制造业实行联营，产量和品质均已提高，但经营仍有缺点，尚待改进。该业多系家庭手工业，规模很小，大多资金困难，生产不振。自上月十一日起采取联合经营办法，组成“肠衣整理联合工业社”，集中一处生产。参加者六十二户，占全市该业百分之九十，资金由全体集股，每股一万元，大部股东参加劳动，共选出十名社务委员分任经理、会计和工厂管理，半月为一期，纯利的分配是百分之十为奖励金（奖给参加劳动的），百分之四十为分红，百分之五十为公积金。第一期人三百九十九股，每股分红三千六百元。第二期增加九十三股新股，产量比第一期约增五成，老股分红每股三千九百八十五元，新股分红每股二千七百十五元。到本月十六日，第三期又增新股一百十二股，前后入股共六百零五股，预计产量仍可增加。过去单独生产时，每户仅一两个工人，谈不到严密分工，现在集中了五十三个工人，互相取长补短，分采购、整理、刮肠、灌肠、打把、防腐六部工作，彼此监督，改进技术，提高品质，务求制成后肠衣不渗水。各户刻已深切认识联营能增加产量，减少同业间竞争和出口商的剥削。过去缺乏资金时向出口商借贷，成品做好后由出口商订价格，不能自主，获利平均不及一成，自联营后，剥削减轻了，获利平均已达三成。为求更进一步发展，经营方法和股东思想还有些须待改正，首先是半月分红一次，影响扩大生产，计算也麻烦，应尽可能把分红期间拉长，或增加纯利中公积金的比例。其次是具有生产技能的股东都应参加劳动，存有思想顾虑和缺乏诚意合作的少数股东，如不愿多吸收资金扩大生产等，应该克服。该业产量可如数出口，需大量吸收资金到西北等各地广收原料，扩大生产。
