　　“Celebrating the Birth of the People's Republic of China”
    ——A Record of the Last Day of the People's Political Consultative Conference
    “Celebrating the birth of the People's Republic of China!”
    “Long live Chairman Mao!”
    At yesterday's closing ceremony of the CPPCC, Commander-in-Chief Zhu concluded his closing remarks with the above two powerful slogans. In his closing remarks, he solemnly stated: "We have unanimously declared the establishment of the People's Republic of China." At this moment, all the lights in the venue shone brightly, controlling [the atmosphere] like a sudden storm. A huge national flag was unfurled on the rostrum, its crimson radiating golden light; the band played the national anthem three times, and people held their breath, applauding in response. An indescribable sense of excitement permeated the venue. Was it relief? Was it gratitude? Everyone who had gone through a long and arduous struggle understood. What were we born into and died for, fighting bravely for? It was for the complete emancipation of the people, for a people's republic. Now, our ideals have become a reality, and our efforts have borne fruit. Let every patriotic Chinese sing for the victory of the people!
    When electing the Chairman, Vice-Chairmen, and members of the Central People's Government Committee, Liu Shaoqi served as the Executive Chairman of the meeting. Zhou Enlai gave a concise explanation of the election method, and Liu Shaoqi announced: "There are a total of five hundred and seventy-six representatives with the right to vote present." After the ballots were distributed, the most solemn ceremony in our founding history officially began. Everyone, after a moment of deep thought, immediately expressed their hopes in the ballot. In fact, the representatives were all confident. Who led the Chinese revolution, who rescued the disaster-ridden Chinese people, who would certainly be elected as the Chairman of the Central Committee. He will continue to lead us, forever towards victory.
    The conference elected sixty representatives as ballot supervisors. Nine ballot boxes were guarded by nine supervisors. The supervisors carefully checked the ballot boxes, locked them cautiously, and handed the keys to the Executive Chairman, and then the voting began. The whole process was so solemn and serious, demonstrating the spirit of the CPPCC meeting from beginning to end. Chairman Mao carefully filled out his ballot, and at exactly 4:20 PM, he put the ballot into ballot box number three.
    Five hundred and seventy-six ballots were retrieved from the opened ballot boxes, which exactly matched the number of ballots issued. Executive Chairman Li Lisan said: "All the representatives with the right to vote have voted, and our voting is valid." The people applauded enthusiastically, celebrating the perfect completion of the voting procedure.
    At 7:30 PM, Executive Chairman Liu Shaoqi announced the election results. He said, word by word: "Chairman of the Central People's Government, Mao Zedong, five hundred and seventy-five votes." All the representatives in the hall stood up and applauded warmly. The band played the music of "The East is Red, the Sun Rises, China has produced a Mao Zedong." The representatives applauded along with the rhythm of the music, interspersed with the shouts of "Long live Mao Zedong." As soon as the music stopped, rhythmic applause rose again. The whole venue was in high spirits, rejoicing and cheering. This was what everyone hoped for, and everyone felt honored and proud to have voted for the great leader. Liu Shaoqi announced: "Vice-Chairman of the Central People's Government, Zhu De..." The venue was in high spirits again, and the "March of the Liberation Army" echoed with the applause, very majestic and powerful. Liu Shaoqi then announced: "Vice-Chairman of the Central People's Government, Liu Shaoqi...", "Vice-Chairman of the Central People's Government, Soong Ching Ling"... Until the list of fifty-six government members was announced, the venue was always filled with showers of applause. Indeed, the Chairman, Vice-Chairmen, and members of the Central Government were perfectly elected, the National Committee of the CPPCC was perfectly elected, the declaration of the First Plenary Session of the CPPCC was perfectly passed... The new China has done everything it should do at the beginning of its founding, and the representatives and the people of the whole country should of course celebrate enthusiastically.
    Chairman Mao and the six Vice-Chairmen walked onto the rostrum amidst sustained applause. Chairman Mao announced: "Our meeting has been completely successful, and now we will hold the closing ceremony." Commander-in-Chief Zhu walked to the microphone and read out the closing remarks. Our founding ceremony has come to a successful end, and the great future of the new China is just beginning.

　　“庆贺中华人民共和国的诞生”
    ——记人民政协最后一天大会
    “庆贺中华人民共和国的诞生!”
    “毛主席万岁！”
    在昨天政协闭幕典礼上，朱总司令以上面两句有力的口号，结束了他的闭幕词。在闭幕词中，他郑重的说：“我们全体一致宣告了中华人民共和国的成立。”这时候，会场中各种灯光齐明，掌握，如急风骤雨。主席台上展开一幅巨大的国旗，鲜红中泛着金光；乐队三奏国歌，人们屏息凝神，鼓掌应和。一种说不出的激奋情绪弥漫会场。是欣慰？是感激？每一个经过长期艰苦斗争的人都是懂得的。我们出生入死，英勇奋战，究竟为了什么？就是为了人民的大翻身，为了一个人民共和国。现在，我们的理想已经变成了现实，我们的努力开花结果了。每一个爱国的中国人，都来为人民的胜利而歌唱吧！
    选举中央政府委员会主席、副主席和委员时，刘少奇任大会执行主席。周恩来对于选举办法作了扼要的说明，刘少奇宣布：“到会有选举权的代表共五百七十六人。”如数发下选票后，在我们开国史中最庄严的仪式正式开始。每一个人经过一度深思，立刻在选票中表达出自己的希望。其实，代表们都是胸有成竹的。谁领导了中国的革命，谁把灾难重重的中国人民解救出来，谁一定被选为中央委员会主席。他会继续领导我们，永远走向胜利。
    大会选出六十个代表作监票人。九个票箱由九个监票人监守着。监查人详细检查了票箱，小心谨慎地锁起来，钥匙交给执行主席，然后开始投票。整个过程是那么严肃认真，表现着政协会议从始至终的精神。毛主席仔仔细细写好了自己的票，在四时二十分正，把票投进第三号票箱。
    从开票箱中检出五百七十六票，与发票数目完全相符。执行主席李立三说：“有选举权的代表都投票了，我们的投票是有效的。”人民热烈鼓掌，庆贺投票手续的完美无缺。
    七时三十分，执行主席刘少奇宣布选举结果。他一字一句地说：“中央人民政府主席，毛泽东，五百七十五票。”全场代表一致起立，热烈鼓掌。乐队奏起“东方红、太阳升、中国出了个毛泽东”的乐曲。代表们合着乐声的节拍鼓掌，其中并夹着此起彼伏的“毛泽东万岁”的口号声。乐声刚刚停止，有节奏的掌声又升扬起来。全场情绪沸腾，欢欣鼓舞。这是众望所归，每一个人都为自己投了伟大领袖一票而感到光荣、骄傲。刘少奇宣布：“中央人民政府副主席，朱德……”，会场又沸腾起来，“解放军进行曲”与掌声相合，十分雄伟有力。刘少奇又宣布：“中央人民政府副主席，刘少奇……”，“中央人民政府副主席，宋庆龄”……一直到宣布了五十六位政府委员的名单，会场上始终回响着阵雨一样的掌声。真的，中央政府主席、副主席和委员完满地选举出来了，政协全国委员会完满地选举出来了，政协第一届全体会议宣言完满地通过了……新中国已经作了她在开基立业时所应作的一切，代表们和全国人民当然要欢欣热烈地庆贺了。
    毛主席和六位副主席在持久的掌声中走上主席台。毛主席宣布：“我们的会议已完满成功，现在举行闭幕式。”朱总司令走到麦克风前，宣读了闭幕词。我们的开国盛典至此胜利结束，新中国的远大将来方在开始。
