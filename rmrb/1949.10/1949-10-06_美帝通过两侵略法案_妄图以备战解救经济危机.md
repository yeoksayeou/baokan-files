　　U.S. Imperialism Passes Two Aggression Bills
    Vainly Attempting to Resolve Economic Crisis Through War Preparations
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 5th: Washington dispatch: The United States Congress recently passed two aggressive foreign expansion bills: one is the "Military Aid to Foreign Countries Act" of $1,314,001,000 passed on September 28, and the other is the "Foreign Aid Act" of $5,899,999,000 passed on September 29. This is one of the steps taken by U.S. imperialism to intensify its arms exports, actively prepare for war, and continue its economic aggression, in a vain attempt to achieve its goals of opposing the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries and resolving its own economic difficulties.
    The Truman Military Aid to Foreign Countries Act was passed in accordance with the amendment passed by the US Senate on the 22nd. Its official name is the "Mutual Defense Assistance Act of 1949." Of the total amount of $1,314,001,000, in addition to using $1 billion to arm the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, it is also stipulated that the remaining funds will be used to continue to assist the Kuomintang remnants in Guangzhou and the reactionary forces in Greece, Turkey, South Korea, the Philippines, and Iran. The aid funds for the Kuomintang remnants are $75 million, which Truman can use freely, and it is stipulated that "the nature of the use need not be specified," that is to say, in addition to military aspects, it will be used for unspeakable and despicable activities.
    Of the $5,899,999,000 in the "Foreign Aid Act," $4,852,380,000 is earmarked as the second year's funding for the implementation of the Marshall Plan. The remainder will be used for occupation costs in Germany, Japan, Austria, and the Ryukyu Islands, as well as "non-military assistance" to Greece and Turkey.

　　美帝通过两侵略法案
    妄图以备战解救经济危机
    【新华社北京五日电】华盛顿消息：美国国会最近通过了两件对外扩张的侵略性法案，一件是九月二十八日通过的十三亿一千四百另一万美元的“军事援外法案”，另一件是二十九日通过的五十八亿另九百九十九万美元的“对外援助法案”。这是美帝国主义加紧军火输出、积极备战并继续其经济侵略，妄图以此达到其反对苏联与人民民主国家和解救其本身经济困难的目的的步骤之一。
    杜鲁门军事援外法案是按照美参议院二十二日修正案通过的，其正式名称为“一九四九年防务互助法案”。在其十三亿一千四百零一万美元的总数中，除以十亿元武装北大西洋公约各国外，并规定以余款充作继续援助广州国民党残匪及希、土、南韩、菲律宾、伊朗反动派之用。对国民党残匪的援助款项为七千五百万美元，由杜鲁门自由动用，且规定“不必列明用途性质”，也就是说除军事方面外，将用于不可告人的卑鄙勾当上。
    五十八亿另九百九十九万美元的“对外援助法案”经费中，规定以四十八亿五千二百三十八万美元作为执行马歇尔计划第二年经费。其余则用于德、日、奥及琉球群岛境内的占领费及对希、土的“非军事性援助”。
