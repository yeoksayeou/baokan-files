　　Chahar and Suiyuan Instruct on Frugal Disaster Relief
    Organize disaster victims for production, mobilize donations from various regions, and strictly enforce staffing and expenditure regulations.
    [Our Newspaper Reporter Zhangjiakou Dispatch] Chahar Province's Sihai, Longguan, Chicheng, Kangbao, Huade, Shangdu, and parts of Yanbei areas have suffered severe insect, wind, and hail disasters this year. In order to assist the 300,000 farmers in the aforementioned regions to overcome the disaster through production, the CCP Chahar Provincial Committee issued an instruction on September 26th to launch a province-wide production and frugality campaign: (1) Call on all agencies and troops in the province, starting from September, to launch a universal one or two meters saving campaign for a temporary period of six months (except at the district level). Units should mobilize all staff to donate their surplus clothes, shoes, socks, pocket money, etc., to help disaster victims, without affecting their lives. (2) Compatriots in non-disaster areas throughout the province should show boundless sympathy for compatriots in disaster areas and launch a "handful of rice" disaster relief campaign. Certain areas in Chabei and Yanbei should prepare to resettle disaster area refugees. (3) Compatriots in disaster areas should engage in transportation and develop sideline production, as well as collect wild vegetables and tree leaves, and implement self-reliance through production. It is imperative to overcome the mentality of simply relying on relief. The instruction stated: Leading agencies at all levels must conscientiously organize this movement, and disaster relief materials must be submitted regularly, uniformly distributed, and promptly transported to disaster areas. Appropriate rewards will be given to those who actively respond to the call and make special achievements in disaster relief work. However, forced orders and "desperate measures" must be prevented at the same time.

    [Suiyuan Telegram] On September 21st, the Suiyuan Provincial Government urgently instructed all regions to launch a frugality and disaster relief campaign. The instruction pointed out that Suiyuan had suffered from spring drought and summer floods, as well as wind, hail, insect, and frost disasters this year. Crop losses reached 300,000 mu, with a reduction of approximately 50,000 shi. Leading cadres at all levels must deeply understand that this year's famine is the greatest difficulty in peaceful construction and should immediately lead by example, practice strict frugality, widely mobilize their subordinate cadres, carry forward the traditional spirit of arduous revolution, and resolutely oppose waste and the pursuit of personal enjoyment in material life. The instruction then put forward several specific regulations regarding staffing and expenditures, requiring strict implementation. 1. The number of personnel in county and district agencies and units must be strictly in accordance with the staffing levels stipulated by the provincial government. 2. No unit is allowed to privately feed horses beyond the authorized establishment. 3. The number of service personnel shall not exceed 20% of the existing number of cadres. 4. At the village level, semi-detached production personnel shall be reorganized in accordance with the principle of four people in large villages and three people in small villages. 5. The restoration of complete primary schools and junior primary schools in winter should be carefully considered based on the local financial capacity. Publicly funded primary school students must be re-examined universally, and favoritism and corruption must be avoided. 6. Strictly implement the measures for handling family members of cadres in agencies and rationally handle the existing family members of cadres in agencies. All agencies should mobilize all personnel to carry forward the spirit of overcoming difficulties during the Anti-Japanese War in terms of daily expenses such as stationery and lamp oil, formulate specific frugality measures for the future, and earnestly implement them. Responding to the call of the North China Bureau, a one or two meters saving campaign will be launched in agency meals, and counties and districts will implement it uniformly from October. Each county can form a frugality and disaster relief committee, personally led by the county head, paying attention to in-depth inspections, and reporting to the provincial government at any time.
