　　Xinxiang People Celebrate in the Rain
    [Xinxiang Electric] On the 2nd, 30,000 people from Xinxiang's Party, government, military, and civilian sectors braved the rain to hold a grand gathering to celebrate the success of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the establishment of the Central People's Government. They also held a large-scale demonstration for the International Day of Struggle for Peace. On that day, the whole city was decorated with lanterns and colored streamers, and the five-star red flag was displayed throughout the city. The conference solemnly began with the raising of the national flag of the People's Republic of China, and the eyes of more than 30,000 people in the audience were focused on the slowly rising red flag. Zhao Shizhen, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Pingyuan Provincial Committee, called on the people of Pingyuan Province to support the Central People's Government, support the Common Program decided by the CPPCC, and strive to realize this program, and to unite to defend world peace! The audience immediately responded with warm applause. The peace parade and demonstration began at 4 p.m. Although it was raining continuously on this day, it could not stop people's high enthusiasm. The parade stretched for several miles, and the audience along the street stood by the roadside to watch, regardless of the rain. There was also a torch parade at night.

　　新乡人民冒雨庆祝
    【新乡电】二日，新乡党政军民三万人冒雨盛大集会庆祝中国政治协商会议的成功，庆祝中央人民政府的成立，并举行了国际和平斗争日大示威。这天全市悬灯结彩，五星红色国旗遍布全城。大会在中华人民共和国国旗起升时隆重开始，全场三万余人的目光都集中在慢慢升起的红旗上。中共平原省委副书记赵时真讲话中号召平原省的人民拥护中央人民政府，拥护政协会议所决定的共同纲领并为实现此纲领而奋斗，并团结起来保卫世界和平！全场立即报以热烈掌声。下午四时开始了和平游行示威，此日虽秋雨连绵，但挡不住人们的热情高涨。游行行列长达数里，沿街观众也不顾雨淋的伫立路旁观看，夜晚更有火炬游行。
