[This city dispatch] The disaster relief movement in Beijing is unfolding universally. Various agencies and organizations in Beijing are universally promoting the spirit of mutual assistance and friendship between urban and rural areas, and successively establishing disaster relief sub-committees and branches to actively launch a movement to donate to the disaster-stricken farmers in Hebei Province and the suburbs of this city. As of yesterday (the 12th), the following 21 units have established disaster relief sub-committees: the Municipal People's Government, the Municipal Branch of the China Democratic League, the Democratic National Construction Association, the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Women's Federation, the United Association of Primary and Secondary School Teachers and Staff, the Public Security Corps, the Municipal Business Community, the Municipal Industrial Association, and the twelve districts of the inner and outer city. The disaster relief branches of the various units under the Municipal Government have all been established. The disaster relief branches of the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce will all be established before the 15th. Other units that have not yet established sub-committees and branches will all establish sub-committees before the 15th and branches before the 20th, in accordance with the resolution of the first standing committee meeting of the Beijing Municipal All-Circles Disaster Relief Committee.

[This city dispatch] Cadres and miscellaneous staff of various units under the Beijing Municipal People's Government, responding to the call of the Beijing Municipal Government Party Committee, are enthusiastically launching a one-or-two-liang-of-rice disaster relief campaign, and have established the Beijing Municipal Government Disaster Relief Sub-Committee and disaster relief branches in various units. Under the leadership of the Beijing Municipal All-Circles Disaster Relief Committee, the organization of the Municipal Government Disaster Relief Sub-Committee will regularly handle matters related to disaster relief in the future. In September alone, according to statistics from only eleven units, the donation of millet alone amounted to 42,832 jin. The 274 members of the disaster relief branch directly under the Secretariat of the Municipal Government can donate a total of 2,243 jin of millet per month for the next six months. Li Wei and Cao Yukun, technicians of the Administrative Office, voluntarily saved 30 jin of millet per person per month. In addition, the disaster relief branch has also received many cotton gowns, shoes, shirts, cloths, and so on. In addition to donating 3,959 jin of rice per month for six months, the 1,645 people in the Commercial Bureau also voluntarily donated 5,974 jin of rice in September, 152,880 yuan in People's Currency, and many other items of clothing. In addition to donating 7,342 jin of millet in September, the 1,738 people in the Municipal Construction Bureau also guaranteed that they could donate 7,061 jin per month for the next five months. The cadres of the Municipal Government are also combining the response to the disaster relief movement with economy, and have proposed slogans such as saving electricity, saving water, saving stationery, and saving time. For example, the stationery required for the work of the Secretariat was supplemented by various sections in addition to the monthly allocation in the past, but now it has been achieved that not only is there no need to supplement, but there is also a surplus.

[This city dispatch] Before the establishment of the Beijing Municipal All-Circles Disaster Relief Committee, the Hebei Provincial Disaster Relief Committee had received large amounts of donations from people from all walks of life in Beijing, various agencies, and North China-based agencies in Beijing. For example, the North China People's Revolutionary University donated 30,000 jin of millet, and the North China People's Supervision Institute, the Ministry of Public Security, the Fourth District Office of Beijing, the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau Trade Union, the Rongxun Team, and Donggaofang Elementary School donated a lot of millet and various items of clothing, including gold jewelry and silver dollars. Now that the Beijing Municipal All-Circles Disaster Relief Committee has been established, all donations of grain and money from all walks of life in Beijing can be directly delivered. The Hebei Provincial Disaster Relief Committee sent a letter to the Municipal Government News Agency a few days ago, expressing its gratitude to the enthusiasm of the above-mentioned donors.
