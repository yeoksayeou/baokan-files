    【新华社布拉格二日电】匈牙利民主妇女联盟秘书埃尔齐·麦斯特于九月二十六日写信给中华全国民主妇女联合会主席蔡畅祝贺中华人民共和国的成立，并致姊妹的敬意。信里说：
    我们经常以最深切的同情注视着你们反对美帝国主义及其走卒蒋介石的英勇斗争的消息，并以很大的崇敬与快慰注视着你们的胜利。中国妇女英雄的事迹以及她们在战场与生产上的胜利，将鼓励为和平而工作的匈牙利妇女。
    现在，你们正以你们伟大的领袖毛泽东宣告中华人民共和国的成立来庆祝你们的胜利。值此庄严的时刻，匈牙利民主妇女联盟谨代表数百万匈牙利妇女向你们致衷心的庆贺。由于你们的胜利，愈来愈强大的以苏联为首的和平保卫者的阵线就更加坚固了。
