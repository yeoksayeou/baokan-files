　　The People's Tribune of Poland publishes an article
    Supporting the Polish government's recognition of China, considering it the most important event in contemporary history occurring in East Asia
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 8th. According to the Polish News Agency, Warsaw: The People's Tribune, the organ of the Polish Workers' Party, published an editorial on the 5th supporting the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Polish government and the People's Republic of China. The editorial stated: The Polish people extend their congratulations with great enthusiasm on the founding of the People's Republic of China. The founding of the People's Republic of China is the successful conclusion of a heroic struggle that has lasted for decades. The working masses of Poland realize that since the October Revolution and the Soviet army's defeat of Nazi Germany, the most important event in contemporary history is taking place in East Asia. This is why the Polish nation wholeheartedly welcomes the government's decision to recognize the People's Republic of China. The editorial pointed out: The Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference declares: "The People's Republic of China unites with all peace-loving and freedom-loving countries and peoples in the world, especially with the Soviet Union, the people's democratic countries, and oppressed nations, and stands on the side of the international peace and democracy camp." This is the same as the purpose of the policy of democratic Poland.

    拥护波政府承认我国认为当代历史上最重要的事件正在东亚发生
    【新华社北京八日电】据波兰通讯社华沙讯：波兰工人党机关报人民论坛报五日发表社论，拥护波兰政府与中华人民共和国建立外交关系。社论说：波兰人民谨以巨大的热忱，祝贺中华人民共和国的成立。中华人民共和国成立这一事实，使已进行了好几十年的英勇斗争大功告成。波兰的劳动群众意识到：自从十月革命与苏军击败纳粹德国以后，当代历史上最重要的事件正在东亚发生。这就是波兰民族为什么衷心欢迎政府决定承认中华人民共和国的原因。社论指出：中国人民政治协商会议的共同纲领声称：“中华人民共和国联合世界上一切爱好和平、自由的国家和人民，首先是联合苏联、各人民民主国家和被压迫民族，站在国际和平民主阵营方面。”这是和民主波兰的政策的宗旨相同的。
