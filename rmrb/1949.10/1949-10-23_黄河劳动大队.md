　　Yellow River Labor Brigade
    Jun Qian
    In May of this year, the Beijing Military Control Commission gathered 437 vagrant soldiers, vagrants, and petty thieves, and formed them into a labor brigade. They were sent to the former Hebei-Shandong-Henan area to participate in the Yellow River levee restoration work, in order to reform them through labor. However, initially, they had many doubts, fearing going to the front line, fearing drowning in the Yellow River, and some were afraid of not being able to endure hardship. Therefore, their morale was very unstable. The leaders of the labor brigade, more than a hundred honored revolutionary soldiers, educated the members with kind and sincere attitudes, helped the members cook, and helped carry luggage during marches. These actions greatly moved the members, so the initial anxiety and fear were somewhat stabilized.
    In early June, the labor brigade arrived at the Fourth Repair and Defense Office of the Yellow River in Pingyuan Province and were assigned to Dong'a and other counties to participate in various labor projects for the Yellow River levee restoration. However, because they had not worked in the past, they were unaccustomed to suddenly engaging in carrying earth and stones. Therefore, some had swollen shoulders and broken hands. In addition, various systems had not yet been established, and supplies were sometimes not timely, so their morale fluctuated again. The honored soldier cadres arduously carried out persuasion and education, encouraging them to affirm their determination to seek reform through labor, and urging them not to be afraid of hardship, because without enduring hardship, they could not seek reform. At the same time, they shared joys and sorrows with them, taking the lead in carrying earth and stones to influence them. At the same time, the following measures were taken to gradually normalize life: (1) According to the regulations of the Yellow River Affairs Bureau, each cubic meter of earth was paid two catties of rice and two catties of firewood, affirming the principle of "more work, more pay" to improve life, rewarding members for doing more, and launching competitions between squads and platoons; (2) Deputy squad leaders, economic committee members, and study group leaders of each squad were democratically elected to be responsible for leading the study and managing their own lives. At the same time, recorders were selected to serve as the basis for evaluating merits and demerits on a monthly basis; (3) A bulletin board was established to commend and criticize at any time, and to conduct democratic education for everyone; (4) Strict mass discipline was enforced, and the system of "kind attitude towards the masses, returning borrowed items, and compensating for damages" was resolutely implemented. After the above arduous work, the labor brigade gradually moved towards consciously working with peace of mind, and achieved the following gains: (1) The thinking of the vast majority of members has been initially transformed, realizing the shamefulness of parasitism, and realizing that after labor training, they can obtain legitimate occupations and become good citizens of the new China. For example, Cai Qiong, a model member of the Second Squadron, said: "If we don't work again, the masses at home won't want us!" Cai and Mao Chuquan often competed to carry large baskets of earth, each time carrying more than two hundred catties, and he did not say strange things, persuaded the backward, warmly cared for the sick, and could promptly reflect opinions to the superiors. In the Second Squadron, out of seventy members, there were twenty-two model activists. Qiao Ping'an (who had served as a platoon deputy in the Chiang Kai-shek bandits for many years) in the First Squadron, was forty-nine years old, and not only had he not asked for leave for three months, but also did odd jobs after work without rest. Zhao Yunhe in the Fourth Squadron carried seven or eight bundles of sorghum stalks at a time during the second Yellow River flood rescue, and was so tired that he couldn't eat, but still kept working hard. There are many similar examples. (2) When they first started carrying earth, they could only carry an average of one or two cubic meters of earth per person per day. After labor training, work efficiency gradually increased to more than three cubic meters, and many even did more than four cubic meters. For example, the total average number of the First Squadron in June and July (including cooks who did not carry earth) was 3.26 cubic meters of earth per labor-day and 2 cubic meters of stone per labor-day. In June and July, the entire brigade carried a total of 37,816.7 cubic meters of earth and 2,572.6 cubic meters of stone, earning 75,633 catties of rice and 88,835 catties of firewood. After deducting various expenses, there was still a surplus of 13,770 catties of rice. This active labor resulted in a happy life. Now, not only has life greatly improved, but there are also savings for building homes. The First Squadron has been eating three meals of white flour every day for three months, and also eats pork two or three times a month. When they first arrived, most were barefoot and their clothes were so tattered that they could not cover their bodies. Now they have all put on new clothes and new shoes. The First Squadron is all wearing neat gray uniforms. Each squadron has also established a small hospital, and can receive treatment at any time when they are sick. (3) Due to labor training and good nutrition, some of their bodies have now become fat and strong labor fighters. (4) Due to regular mass discipline education and strengthened mass concepts, almost no incidents of violating the interests of the masses have occurred in the past three months. They can strictly implement the regulations of returning borrowed items, compensating for damages, and having a kind attitude in words and deeds, and help the landlord do work at any time. Therefore, they can establish harmonious feelings with the masses wherever they go.
    They have now been initially transformed.
    The old society harmed them, and the new society helps them transform into useful people. They are on the bright road to a new life.

　　黄河劳动大队
    君谦
    今年五月，北京军管会曾集中了四百三十七名流散军人，游民，小偷，把他们组成了劳动大队，开到原冀鲁豫区，参加黄河复堤工作，以便在从事劳动中，来改造他们。但起初，他们存在着许多疑虑，怕到前线，怕到黄河里淹死，还有的怕吃不了苦，因此，情绪是十分不稳的。领导劳动大队的是百余名荣誉革命军人以和霭、热诚的态度，向队员进行教育，帮助队员做饭，行军帮助扛行李，这些行动给队员以极大感动，因此恐惧不安的情绪，就得到了初步的稳定。
    六月初，劳动大队来到平原省黄河第四修防处，被分配到东阿等县，参加黄河复堤的各种劳动工程。但因为他们过去已是当年不劳动，现在骤然从事抬土，抬石，很不习惯，因此，有的膀子压肿了，手磨破了，加之各种制度尚未建立好，供给有时也不够及时，因此，他们情绪遂又波动起来。荣军干部同志，一面艰苦的进行说服教育，鼓励他们肯定参加劳动求得改造的决心，勉励他们不要怕吃苦，怕吃苦，就不能求得改造；一面也和他们共甘苦，带头抬土，抬石，来感化他们。同时并采取了以下措施，使生活逐渐走上正规：（一）根据河务局的规定，每方土按二斤米、二斤柴发工资，肯定多做多得，多得了才能改善生活的原则，奖励队员多做，并发动了班、排间的竞赛；（二）民主选举了各班的副班长、经济委员、学习组长，负责领导学习与管理自己的各种生活，同时选出记功员，按月作为评功过的根据；（三）建立壁报，随时表扬、批评，向大家进行民主教育；（四）严格群众纪律，坚决贯彻对群众态度和霭、借物送还、损坏赔偿的制度。在经过以上艰苦工作之后，劳动大队内，逐渐的走向了自觉的安心劳动，并获得如下的收获：（一）绝大部分队员的思想，都已得到了初步的改造，了解到寄生的可耻，了解到经过劳动锻炼后，可以得到正当的职业，可以做个新中国的好公民。如第二中队模范蔡琼说：“咱要再不劳动，回到家里，群众也不会要咱的”！蔡和毛楚泉经常比赛抬大筐土，每次要抬到二百多斤，并且他不说怪话，劝说落后的，热心照顾病号，能及时对上级反映意见。第二中队在七十名队员中，就出现了二十二名模范积极分子。第一中队乔平安（当过多年蒋匪排副），四十九岁了，不但三个月没有请假休过工，在每次下工后，还不休息的做零活，四中队赵云和，在第二次黄河涨水运秫秸抢险时，他一次扛七、八个，累的吃不下饭去，仍一个劲的干。类似以上的例子多的很。（二）开始抬土时，平均每人每天只能抬一、二方土，经过劳动的锻炼，工作效率就逐渐提高到三方多，还有不少做到四方多的，如第一中队六、七两月份的总平均数（不抬土的伙夫在内），每工抬土三点二六方，每工抬石二方；六、七两月份，全大队除了病工、阴雨误工等外，共抬土三万七千八百一十六点七方，共抬石二千五百七十二点六方，共得米七万五千六百三十三斤，柴八万八千八百三十五斤，除了各项开支，尚结余米一万三千七百七十斤。这种积极劳动的结果换来了幸福的生活，现在不但生活大为改善，并有了积余建设家务，第一中队三个月来，始终每天吃着三顿白面，每月还吃两三次猪肉；初来到时，大多赤脚，衣服破烂得不能敝体，现在则都已穿上了新衣、新鞋，第一中队则都穿着整齐的灰色制服；各队并建立了小医院，有了疾病，随时可以得到治疗。（三）由于劳动的锻炼，和好生活的营养，现在他们的身体，有些都已成了又胖又壮的劳动战士。（四）由于经常进行了群众纪律教育，加强了群众观念，三个月来几乎没有发生过违犯群众利益的事，他们都能严格执行了借物送还，损物赔偿，言语态度和霭的规定，并随时帮助房东做活。因而每到一村，即能和群众取得融洽的情感。
    他们现在已得到初步改造。
    旧社会坑害了他们，新社会来帮助他们改造成有用的人。他们是走上新生的光明道路了。
