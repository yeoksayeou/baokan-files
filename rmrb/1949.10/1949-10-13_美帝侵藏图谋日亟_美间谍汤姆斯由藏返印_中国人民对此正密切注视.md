Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12th. The Chinese people are closely watching the American imperialist conspiracy to invade our country's territory of Tibet. According to reports from Washington and Calcutta, India, the American spy Thomas, who was dispatched under the guise of a "radio commentator," entered Tibet in August of this year with the help of the reactionary Nehru government's Foreign Minister. After two months of activities, he obtained a letter from the Dalai Lama to Truman on the 10th of this month and flew back to Calcutta from Tibet on a special plane from the American Embassy in India. On the 10th, Thomas made a statement in Calcutta, openly declaring that "the Tibetan authorities' army is poorly equipped and needs outside assistance to stop the progress of the Communists." Thomas's espionage activities and arrogant remarks demonstrate that the American imperialists are also intensifying their plot against Tibet.

　　美帝侵藏图谋日亟
    美间谍汤姆斯由藏返印
    中国人民对此正密切注视
    【新华社北京十二日电】中国人民正密切注视着美国帝国主义侵略我国领土西藏的阴谋活动。据美国华盛顿及印度加尔各答消息透露，美国所派遣以“广播评论员”名义出现的间谍汤姆斯，于本年八月间取得印度尼赫鲁反动政府外交部长帮助进入西藏后，经过两个月的活动，已于本月十日在取得达赖喇嘛致杜鲁门的信件后乘印度美使馆专机离藏飞返加尔各答。汤姆斯十日在加尔各答发表谈话，公开声称：“西藏当局所属军队装备很差，需要外界援助，用以阻止共产党的进展。”汤姆斯的间谍活动和狂妄谈话，说明美国帝国主义对西藏的图谋也日益加紧。
