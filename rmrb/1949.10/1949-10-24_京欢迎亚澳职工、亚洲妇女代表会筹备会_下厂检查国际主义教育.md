[Beijing News] The Beijing Municipality Welcoming Preparatory Committee for the Asian-Australasian Workers' Conference and the Asian Women's Conference held a meeting last night (the 23rd) at the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions. They discussed inspecting the progress of internationalist education in various factories, the establishment of workers' clubs, and the development of labor insurance work. Cadres from units such as the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, and the Women's Committee, totaling more than twenty people, attended. It was decided to form four inspection teams, led by Zhang Hongshun, Zu Tiangong, Zhang Chenggang, and others respectively. Starting today, they will inspect eleven units, including the Tram Company, People's Printing Factory, Telecommunications Bureau, Shijingshan Power Plant, Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, Clothing Factory, and the 70th Ordnance Factory, in order to combine the welcoming of Asian-Australasian worker representatives and Asian women representatives coming to Beijing, to further enhance workers' internationalist education, establish workers' clubs, and appropriately resolve the main issues in labor insurance work.
