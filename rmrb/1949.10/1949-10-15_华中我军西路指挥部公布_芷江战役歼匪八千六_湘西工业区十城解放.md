　　Xinhua News Agency, Central China Front, 14th: The West Route Command of the People's Liberation Army on the Central China Front has announced the results of the Zhijiang Campaign, stating:

　　Our powerful army corps, in order to cut off the westward escape route of Bai Chongxi's bandit troops, launched an offensive from the Fengxian to Changde line on September 13th. Dividing into two routes along the south bank of the Yuan River, they marched directly south. After seventeen days of mountain and river crossings, they arrived in the area south of Xupu and Chenxi on the 30th. Along the way, they engaged the bandits at Guanzhuang, Madiyi, Yuanling, Yanxi, Dizhuang, and other places. The bandit Provisional 1st Division, Provisional 2nd Division, and local bandit armed forces collapsed at the first touch and fled in panic, with a portion intercepted by our army. Our army then divided into three routes to encircle and annihilate the enemy in Zhijiang, Huaihua, Anjiang, and other places. On October 1st, they occupied Huaihua and Huaqiao to its north, completely annihilating the 700th Regiment of the 234th Division of the bandit 103rd Army, capturing over a thousand bandits. The bandit 17th Army Group headquarters stationed at Yushuwawan on the Hunan-Guizhou Highway and the enemy defending Huaihua City all fled south in a panic. The assorted bandit forces gathered in Zhijiang, including the Security Regiment, Garrison Regiment, Military Police Regiment, the puppet Ministry of National Defense Assault Column, the Joint Logistics Headquarters, the Zhijiang Garrison Command, and the Suppression Column, also began to disperse and flee before September 30th. Our army occupied Zhijiang City on the 2nd, and another route occupied Jiangkou Town, pursuing the fleeing enemy and liberating Anjiang on the 4th. The bandit army continued to flee, scurrying towards Hongjiang, and together with the bandit 100th Army in that area, fled to Huitong in succession. Our army followed closely and seized 30 vehicles in the area. They then took vehicles in hot pursuit, and the various bandit forces fled to the vicinity of Yanjiao on the Huitong-Hongjiang Highway, where they were finally captured by our forces, who annihilated most of them, capturing 4,000 bandits and seizing more than 80 vehicles. On the 5th, our army pursued the victory to Jingxian on the Hunan-Guizhou border (incorrectly reported as the 8th in the previous dispatch). At this point, the battle came to an end.

　　Preliminary statistics of the battle results: (1) Liberated ten county towns in the Western Hunan Industrial Zone, including Yuanling, Luxi, Chenxi, Xupu, Huaihua, Mayang, Zhijiang, Qianyang, Huitong, and Jingxian, as well as many towns such as Guanzhuang, Yushuwawan, Pushi, Gaochun, Jiangkou, Yanxi, Dizhuang, Anjiang, and Hongjiang. (2) Annihilated 8,654 bandits, including 6,731 captured bandit officers and soldiers, 427 bandit officers and soldiers killed or wounded, and 1,496 bandit soldiers who surrendered. (3) Seized 78 artillery pieces of various types (including 6 mountain guns, 1 field gun, 4 anti-tank guns, 1 rocket launcher, 5 mortars, and 61 60mm mortars), 57 grenade launchers, 26 heavy machine guns, 83 light machine guns, 88 submachine guns, 2,219 rifles and carbines, 118 short guns, 1,329 rounds of various types of artillery shells, 29,596 rounds of various types of bullets (and another 104 boxes of bullets seized), 127 vehicles, 4 steamships, and 2 wireless telephones.
