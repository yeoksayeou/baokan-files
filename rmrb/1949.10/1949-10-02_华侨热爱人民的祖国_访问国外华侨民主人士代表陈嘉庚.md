Overseas Chinese Love the People's Motherland
——An Interview with Chen Jiageng, Representative of Overseas Chinese Democratic Personages

“We overseas Chinese have always loved our motherland and have great expectations for its future.” This was the statement made by Chen Jiageng on behalf of overseas Chinese democratic personages and patriotic compatriots at the First Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on September 24th.

Chen Jiageng is one of the leaders of overseas Chinese. In Malaya, where he resides, the total population is over six million, and the Chinese account for two and a half million. In the entire Nanyang region, including Annam, Siam, Burma, Malaya, the Philippines, Indonesia, and North Borneo, the total population is 150 million, and the Chinese account for 10 million. Overseas Chinese not only have a large population but also a significant economic presence in the local areas. Most of the rice mills and other factories in various places are operated by overseas Chinese. As for sales and merchants, whether wholesale or retail, coastal or inland, most are handled by overseas Chinese. The remittances sent back to the motherland by overseas Chinese each year amount to hundreds of millions. Since the Xinhai Revolution, the cultural and educational undertakings of overseas Chinese in Nanyang have also developed vigorously. In Malaya alone, the Chinese have established 1,800 schools (excluding English schools) with approximately 200,000 students; all use the national language for instruction, making it prevalent in Nanyang. In Malaya alone, there are more than ten Chinese newspapers (including four or five in Singapore), each publishing two large sheets daily. The New China News Agency's Hong Kong branch sends manuscripts by air from Hong Kong every day, and they can be delivered at the latest the next day. Except for newspapers manipulated by the Kuomintang reactionaries, they are widely published and well-received by overseas Chinese in Nanyang. Overseas Chinese also hope that the New China News Agency can establish branches in Nanyang to introduce more of the actual situation in all aspects of the people's motherland.

However, in the past, although overseas Chinese loved their motherland, they did not receive protection. Most of the overseas Chinese hailed from Fujian and Guangdong provinces. They were oppressed and exploited in their hometowns, and they had no choice but to leave their homes and venture to Nanyang; some were even treated as "coolies" and tricked into doing hard labor in foreign lands. Relying on their diligence and frugality, they struggled hard under the exclusion, restrictions, and oppression of imperialism and became the main force in developing Nanyang. This contains a lot of bitter tears. After the Japanese surrender, China was listed as one of the four major powers in the world, and overseas Chinese were overjoyed. Many overseas Chinese in Siam, who had been assimilated and did not know the language of their motherland, also wanted to learn the language and writing of their motherland. As a result, the Kuomintang government was reactionary and corrupt, which greatly disappointed the overseas Chinese. As Mr. Chen Jiageng said: “In the past twenty years or so, we and our relatives in the country have suffered enough from the Kuomintang reactionary government, which "says all the good things but does all the bad things." We contributed money, soldiers, and technicians, and did our best to serve the motherland, but we overseas Chinese did not receive protection from the Kuomintang government, and our relatives in the country suffered from the exploitation and oppression of this reactionary government. Not to mention that we had no say in domestic politics." Not only that, Chen Jiageng also mentioned that after the end of World War II, national liberation movements in various parts of Nanyang surged, and many overseas Chinese youths in Malaya also participated in the Malayan People's Revolutionary Movement under the leadership of the Malayan Communist Party. The inhuman Kuomintang reactionaries and secret agents even tried to provoke the relationship between overseas Chinese and the Malayan people in various ways, creating blacklists and falsely accusing and informing the local imperialist colonial government. Most of those listed were not spared. Upwards of 20,000 national liberation fighters and overseas Chinese democratic personages were arrested by British imperialism, and thousands were deported. In many villages, as long as one person informed that a Malayan Communist Party member or Malayan Liberation Army soldier had passed through, the British imperialists would evict the residents and burn the entire village. The most tragic thing was that the overseas Chinese who had lived there for generations, and who had no idea of the hometowns of their ancestors, were deported with their entire families, old and young. If they were from Fujian, they were transported to Xiamen; if they were from Chaozhou, they were transported to Shantou, regardless of their life or death. However, the Kuomintang reactionaries were very proud of this and were very popular in the local imperialist government offices. With regard to the people's revolutionary movement in the motherland, the Kuomintang reactionaries wooed and used some hosts of guild halls who did not understand the righteousness or some overseas Chinese merchants with some social status to control some newspapers and cultural groups to carry out slanderous misrepresentation and reactionary propaganda. Local overseas Chinese democratic personages and patriots also published newspapers such as the Nanyang Overseas Chinese Daily and the Modern Daily to confront the reactionaries, trying their best to expose the corruption of the Kuomintang government and support the people's revolutionary movement in the motherland. Although the Kuomintang reactionaries were base and shameless, colluding with the imperialist government to arrest and deport people who advocated democracy and patriotism, the people's resistance struggle has always been maintained. Chen Jiageng told the reporter excitedly: "Almost all of the overseas Chinese in Nanyang, such as youths, workers, and students, can be said to be inclined towards the new China and towards new democracy. Other overseas Chinese, except for the Kuomintang reactionaries, and some feudal diehards who are not easy to see the situation clearly for a while, also support the new China. It is not uncommon for the father to be conservative and the children to be progressive in a family."

Between late June and mid-August, Chen Jiageng spent about sixty days visiting the Northeast, visiting more than ten cities, more than sixty factories, as well as academic institutions, prisons, vegetable markets, and other places. His impression was: "The responsible authorities were sincere, diligent, humble, lived simply, and dressed plainly... The public order and security were well-organized. Illiteracy has been reduced and may soon be eradicated; beggar shelters have turned to production; gambling, prostitution, and dancing girls are about to disappear; the unemployed vagrants of the past now all have something to do. What is especially valuable is that prisons have become schools and factories, arousing their self-esteem to be human beings again, and the future is bright, just like visiting Yan'an in those years." In terms of industry, "Fushun, Benxi, Anshan, Siping, and other places have more than ten coal, iron, oil, and other mines and factories, which are grand in scale, complex in machinery, and stretch for several miles..." "The lives of the employees are stable, and in their spare time, they have organizations such as trade union labor palaces and clubs for reading, seminars, and proper entertainment, so they believe that they are working for the country and for themselves." What he saw of the farmers was "diligent cultivation, weeding out all the weeds and still working hard to cultivate, which I had not seen when I was young in my hometown and when I was growing up in Nanyang, ... also because of the appropriate agricultural policies, the success of land reform, and the farmers' love for their own land is a major factor." In addition, Mr. Chen Jiageng also put forward many valuable opinions on factory management and other construction.

When talking about the future of the people's motherland, Chen Jiageng said: "This time I went to the Northeast and saw the scale and achievements of the industrial construction in the Northeast. With the Northeast as a leader, the future of the motherland is undoubtedly bright!" He expressed satisfaction and warm support for the common program passed by the conference, which stipulates items such as "facilitating overseas remittances" and "making every effort to protect the legitimate interests of overseas Chinese."

At the age of seventy-six, Chen Jiageng cherishes his motherland, travels across the oceans, and returns to investigate the achievements of the people's motherland. Although he is still energetic and tireless in the extremely tense life of the conference. On the night before the reporter's interview, he only went to bed at 2:00 a.m. and got up at 5:00 a.m., and his spirit was as usual. It is said that after the conference, he will also go to Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, and Central China to conduct inspections, and then return to Nanyang to report the facts to the overseas Chinese. He said that the purpose of his return to China is to introduce the general situation of the overseas Chinese in Nanyang to the domestic compatriots, and on the other hand, to introduce the situation of the motherland to the overseas Chinese, so that the motherland and the overseas Chinese can become more familiar with each other.

　　华侨热爱人民的祖国
    ——访问国外华侨民主人士代表陈嘉庚
    “我们海外华侨一向热爱祖国，对于祖国前途抱有很大的期待。”这是陈嘉庚代表海外华侨民主人士和爱国同胞，九月二十四日，在中国人民政协第一届会议上的表示。
    陈嘉庚是海外侨胞领袖之一，他侨居的马来亚，总人口六百多万，华侨就占了二百五十万人。整个南洋，包括安南、暹罗、缅甸、马来亚、菲律宾、印度尼西亚和北婆罗洲，共有人口一万万五千万人，华侨占了一千万人。华侨不仅人口众多，在当地经济上也有很大的力量。各处米厂及其他工厂，大半是华侨经营的。至于售卖商贩，不拘批发或零售，海口或内地，更多是由华侨经手。每年华侨汇回祖国的款项，数以亿计。从辛亥革命以来，南洋华侨的文化教育事业，也有蓬勃的发展。仅马来亚的华侨，就办有一千八百所学校（英文学校在外），二十万左右的学生；都用国语教授，使得国语通行南洋。马来亚一地即有中文报纸十多种（内新加坡有四、五种），每日出两大张。香港新华分社每日由港航寄的稿件，至迟第二天即可送到，除国民党反动派操纵的报纸外，普遍刊用，受到南洋华侨很大欢迎，华侨并希望新华社能在南洋设立分社，和更多的介绍人民祖国各方面实际情况。
    但在过去的日子里，华侨虽然热爱祖国，却得不到保护。侨胞祖籍大多是福建、广东两省，他们在家乡受压迫受剥削，无奈离乡背井，挺走南洋；甚至被当作“猪仔”，拐到异乡做苦工。靠着他们的辛勤节俭，在帝国主义的排挤、限制、压迫下艰苦奋斗，成为开发南洋的主要力量。这中间含着多少辛酸泪。日寇投降后，中国曾列为世界四强之一，海外华侨兴高采烈，暹罗许多被暹化不识祖国文语的侨胞，也纷纷要学习祖国语言文字。结果，国民党政府反动腐化，使侨胞大失所望。正如陈嘉庚先生所说的：“这二十几年来，我们和我们在国内的誊属吃够了“好话说尽坏事做尽”的国民党反动政府的痛苦，我们出钱，出壮丁，出技术人员，尽力替祖国服务，但在海外的我们受不到国民党政府的保护，在国内的眷属受尽了这个反动政府的榨取和压迫，我们更不要说在国内政治上有什么发言权了。”不仅如此，陈嘉庚还说到：第二次世界大战结束后，南洋各地民族解放运动风起云涌，马来亚许多华侨青年，也参加到马共领导下的马来亚人民革命运动中。毫无人性的国民党反动派和特务分子，竟多方挑拨华侨和马来亚人民的关系，造黑名单，向当地帝国主义殖民地政府诬告密告。所列报的多难幸免。民族解放战士及华侨民主人士前后被英帝国主义逮捕的达两万多人，数千人被驱逐出境。有许多村庄，只要有一个人告密，说有一个马共党员或马来亚解放军从那里经过，英帝即把居民驱逐，烧毁全村。最悲惨的是久居数代的当地生长的侨胞，完全不知原籍祖国何乡何里，全家老幼被逐，如是福建人则运交厦门，潮州人则运交汕头，生死不管。但国民党反动派却甚形得意，在当地帝国主义官厅中灸手可热。对祖国的人民革命运动，国民党反动派拉拢利用一部分不明大义的会馆主持人或有点社会地位的侨商，来把持一些报纸和文化团体，进行污蔑曲解和反动宣传。当地华侨民主人士和爱国人士也出版南侨日报、现代日报等报纸，与反动派对抗，尽量揭露国民党政府的腐化，拥护祖国的人民革命运动。虽然国民党反动派卑污无耻，勾结帝国主义政府逮捕驱逐主张民主爱国人士，但人民的反抗斗争还是一直坚持下来。陈嘉庚很兴奋地告诉记者说：“南洋的青年、工人、学生等侨胞，几乎可以说全部都倾向新中国，倾向新民主主义这方面来。其他侨胞，除了国民党反动分子，以及一部分封建顽固守旧的，一时不易看清形势之外，也都是拥护新中国的。一家之中，父亲守旧儿女进步的，很是不少。”
    陈嘉庚在六月下旬至八月中旬之间，曾以六十天左右的时间，到东北参观，前后访问十余城市，六十多处工厂，以及学术机关、监狱、菜市等场所。所得印象为：“各负责当局，态度恳切，勤奋虚怀，生活简约，衣服朴素……。治安秩序，井然可观。文盲减少，不久可能肃清；乞丐收容所转向生产，赌博、娼妓与舞女，行将绝迹；以前失业游民，今已各有所事。尤可贵者，监狱变成学校工厂，唤起其重新做人的自尊心，前途光明气象，宛如访问延安当年。”在工业方面，则是“抚顺、本溪、鞍山、四平等处，煤铁石油等矿厂十余所，规模伟大，机器复杂，绵延数里之长，……”“职工生活安定，业余则有职工会劳动宫及俱乐部之组织，读书、座谈及正当娱乐，故认为是为国家亦为自己而工作。”所见农民，则是“勤奋耕耘，杂草除尽而尚努力勤锄培养，乃余少时在乡及长在南洋对农业所未见之现象，……要亦农业政策得宜，土地改革成功，农民爱护自己田地为一主要因素。”此外，陈嘉庚先生对工厂管理及其他建设等，也提了不少宝贵意见。
    在谈到对人民祖国的远景时，陈嘉庚说：“这次到东北，看到东北工业建设的规模与成绩，以东北为带头，祖国前途的光明是毫无问题的！”对大会通过的共同纲领，规定“便利侨汇”及“尽力保护海外华侨正当利益”等项。陈先生代表海外华侨表示满意与热烈拥护。
    陈嘉庚以七十六高龄眷念祖国，远涉重洋回来考察人民祖国政绩。虽在大会极度紧张的生活中仍精神矍铄，毫无倦容。记者访问的前夜，他午夜二时始就寝，五时即起，精神亦一如平日。闻他在大会之后，还将到内蒙、山西、华中各地考察，然后返回南洋向侨胞作实情报告。他说：他回国的目的，就是一面把南洋侨胞一般情形介绍给国内同胞，另一面，把祖国情况介绍给侨胞，使祖国与侨胞更互相熟悉。
