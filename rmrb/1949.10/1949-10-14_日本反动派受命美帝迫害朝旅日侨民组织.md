　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 13th: TASS Moscow, 12th: Kremnev, in an article in "Labor News," commented on the Yoshida government's dissolution of the Korean Residents Union in Japan and the Korean Youth League, two Korean democratic organizations, stating: This new manifestation of police club politics was adopted by the Japanese reactionaries with the approval of MacArthur Headquarters. This Korean democratic organization, established immediately after Japan's surrender, has been fighting from its first day for the basic democratic rights of Korean residents in Japan. The Korean Residents Union conducted extensive cultural activities among its members. Thanks to the union's efforts, it established 56 Korean elementary schools in Japan, with 60,000 students, as well as 13 secondary schools, 2 higher education schools, and other educational institutions.
　　The author continued: The Japanese government's decision to ban democratic organizations is a new and serious trampling on basic democratic freedoms. According to the Japanese government's orders, the property of the Korean democratic organizations was confiscated, and their leaders were prohibited from engaging in public and political activities. The police are monitoring the activities of all 400,000+ members of these two organizations. Their crime is merely that they sympathize with the North Korean People's Democratic Government and support the establishment of a unified and democratic Korean state. The author concluded: The Korean Residents Union in Japan and the Japanese public are rising up to protest the tyrannical treatment of Koreans by the Japanese reactionary ruling clique.

　　日本反动派受命美帝迫害朝旅日侨民组织
    【新华社北京十三日电】塔斯社莫斯科十二日讯：克列姆尼夫在劳动报上著文评论吉田政府解散朝鲜旅日侨民同盟和朝鲜青年同盟两个朝鲜民主组织称：这种新的警察棍棒政治的表现，是日本反动派在麦克阿瑟总部的批准下采取的。这个在日本投降后立即成立的朝鲜民主组织，从它成立的第一天起，就在为争取旅日朝鲜侨民的基本民主权利而奋斗。朝鲜侨民同盟在其会员中进行广泛的文化活动。由于同盟的努力，它在日本建立了五十六所朝鲜人的小学校，有六万学生，以及十三所中等学校、二所高等教育学校和其他的教育机关。
    作者继称：日本政府禁止民主组织活动的决定，是对基本民主自由的新的严重蹂躏。根据日本政府的命令，朝鲜民主组织的财产被充公，他们的领袖们被禁止从事公众的和政治的活动。警察监视这两个组织全部四十余万会员的活动。它们的罪状仅仅是因为它们同情北朝鲜人民民主政府，拥护建立统一的民主的朝鲜国家。作者结语指出：朝鲜旅日侨民同盟和日本的公众，群起抗议日本反动统治集团对朝鲜人的强横待遇。
