　　Jottings from the Sports Meet
    Feng Zhong
    △ On the second day of the Beijing People's Sports Meet—the 23rd—many workers from factories and trade unions in various districts paraded with large red flags to watch, because it was Sunday. The number of events for workers increased that day; workers from nineteen factories and mines participated in the 800-meter relay race, eighteen units participated in the tug-of-war, and ten factory units participated in ball game performances. Sports are gradually moving from schools to factories. We must continue to popularize sports in the countryside.
    △ Many performances are creative combinations of sports, music, and singing. The Beijing Normal University performed "Defend World Democratic Peace," forming a large red star and the hammer and sickle emblem of the Party, as well as the words "Defend World Peace," accompanied by violin, piano, and drums, which further increased the liveliness. The Second Affiliated Elementary School of Beijing Normal University performed "Eagle Catches Chicks," the Chongci Girls' Middle School performed the change-step dance, the former Yuan'ensi Elementary School performed "Hearing the War Drums," and sixteen elementary schools in the Fifth District jointly performed the "Democratic Youth Dance," all of which were accompanied by music and singing, increasing the vivacity of the content.
    △ The gymnastics performance by one hundred students from the School for the Deaf and Dumb was particularly touching. They overcame their congenital physiological defects, using their eyes instead of their ears, following the gestures of the teachers, and were able to shout "Celebrate the liberation of all of China" and "Long live Chairman Mao."
    △ Children aged five and six from the Yongguangsi Middle Street Kindergarten dressed up as workers and peasants to perform singing and dancing, learning the movements of peasants plowing, sowing, and winnowing, as well as performing the Yangko dance, in an orderly and consistent manner. A Soviet friend took photos of them one after another from the rostrum.
    △ The acrobatics performance by a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army was another outstanding event. The first formation was a four-tiered archway, with the words "People's Army" on the plaque and two "August 1st" red stars, with a portrait of Chairman Mao in the center, and the words "Moving Towards Regularization," "Building National Defense Forces," "Defend the People," and "Defend the People's Republic of China" on both sides. The second formation was a high human mountain, with six machine guns pointing to the sky. On both sides were red banners with yellow characters reading "Defend the Motherland" and "Defend Peace." The third formation was a three-dimensional "People's" warship, as if it were really sailing on the sea, with machine guns on the ship aiming at the enemy, and People's airplanes (paper models) taking off from the ship. The whole audience shouted "Attack Taiwan" and "Capture Chiang Kai-shek alive." Finally, a large five-pointed star five people high was formed, with a giant image of Chairman Mao in the center and the slogan "Chairman Mao, you are the lighthouse" hanging below. Li Kuiyuan, the person in charge of the PLA unit performing the acrobatics, said: "It is unprecedented for us to participate in the Sports Meet. Participating in the performance was the idea of everyone, and the various movements were collectively created, researched and improved bit by bit."
    △ The last program in the morning was the formation change by 2,400 students from Xinsheng Middle School. They entered in step, and the formation first changed into a large five-pointed star, with the national flag in the very center of the five-pointed star. More than a dozen doves, symbolizing peace, were released. The birth of the People's Republic of China has further increased the strength of the world peace camp.
    △ When the Tibetan dance and Mongolian gymnastics from the Mongolian-Tibetan School appeared, the audience immediately erupted in thunderous applause, and the military band specially played the tune "Unity is Strength." From their dances and gymnastics, we can see the living habits of ethnic minorities, deepening our understanding of the close unity between all ethnic groups.
    △ In the Red Flag Dance by the Youth Art Academy, forty-two red flags fluttered across the field, led by the national flag, the Party flag, and the military flag. The military band played the Liberation Army March, and the bugles blew the charge. The young soldiers bravely charged towards the enemy's陣 (zhèn).
    △ The last item was the Great Unity Gymnastics performance by Guanghua Girls' Middle School. The costumes and movements were uniform and consistent, and there were many complicated movements such as "lying down" and "two-person splits." The red star and the yellow hammer and sickle were particularly brilliant. All of the school's four hundred plus students participated in this performance.
    △ Many international friends came to visit. In the afternoon, the representative of the Asian Women's Federation, Chi Luo, also attended the meeting. The "Express News" of the meeting published a paragraph of international friends' impressions of the Sports Meet: "Whether in terms of programs, venues, venue layout, and conference work...etc., all aspects are very exciting and orderly." They were very happy and liked it very much. Among the various performances and track and field events, they liked the tug-of-war, the kindergarten children's games, the obstacle race, and the women's sports, etc. the most. There is a saying in the Soviet Union, "Children are the flowers of life." They have the same feeling about Chinese children. (Photos attached)

　　体育大会杂记
    冯仲
    △北京市人民体育大会第二天—二十三日，因为是星期日，许多工厂和各区工会的工人们都打着大红旗列队去参观。这一天工人的节目增多了，有十九个厂矿工人参加了八百公尺接力，参加拔河比赛的也有十八个单位，另外有十个工厂单位参加了球类表演。体育由学校逐渐走进了工厂，我们还要继续把体育普及到农村去。
    △许多表演是体育、音乐与歌唱结合的创造。师大表演“保卫世界民主和平”，组成大红星和镰刀斧头的党徽以及“保卫世界和平”几个大字，用提琴、钢琴、锣鼓伴奏，更增加了活泼性。师大二附小表演“老鹰捉小鸡”，崇慈女中的换步舞，前圆恩寺小学的“听战鼓响了”，第五区十六个小学联合表演的“民主青年舞”等也都有音乐与歌唱陪衬，增加了内容的活泼。
    △聋哑学校一百个学生表演体操，感人尤深。他们战胜了先天的生理上的缺陷，以眼代耳，听从教员手势指挥，竟能够喊出“庆祝全中国解放”，“毛主席万岁”。
    △永光寺中街幼稚园五、六岁的小孩们化装成工农表演唱游，学习农民锄地、播种、扬场等动作和扭秧歌，次序整齐不乱。一个苏联友人在主席台上一张连一张的给他们拍照。
    △解放军某部的叠罗汉又是一个突出节目，头一个叠成四层高的牌坊，上匾是“人民军队”四字和两个“八一”红星，正中是毛主席像，两侧是“走向正规化”、“建设国防军”、“保卫人民”、“保卫中华人民共和国”。第二个叠成高高的人山，有六挺机枪指向天空。两旁高举着“保卫祖国”、“保卫和平”红底黄色大字。第三个叠成立体的“人民号”军舰，好象真的在海上航行起来了，舰上机枪瞄准敌人，人民飞机（纸模型）由舰上飞起，全场一齐高喊“打到台湾去”，“活捉蒋介石”。最后叠起五人高的大五角星，正中毛主席的巨像下悬着“毛主席，你是灯塔”几个大字标语。表演叠罗汉的解放军某部负责人李奎元说：我们参加体育大会是空前的事，参加表演是大家的意思，各种动作也是集体的创作，一点一滴的研究改进得来的。
    △上午最后一项节目是新生中学二千四百人的变换队形组字，齐步入场，队形先变成一个大五星，五星的正中国旗下。飞出了十几只象征和平的鸽子。中华人民共和国诞生，更增加了世界和平阵营的力量。
    △蒙藏学校的西藏舞和蒙古操出场了，全场立刻爆发雷动的掌声，军乐队特别奏起了“团结就是力量”的曲子。我们由他们的舞蹈和体操中可以看出少数民族的生活习惯。加深了我们对各民族间的亲密团结。
    △青年艺术学院的红旗舞，四十二面红旗满场翻飞，国旗、党旗、军旗前导，军乐奏起了解放军进行曲，军号吹着冲锋号，青年的战士们勇猛地杀向了敌阵。
    △最后一项光华女中的大团结体操，服装动作，整齐划一，而且有许多“卧倒”，“二人平均”等复杂动作，组成的红星和黄色的镰刀斧头，尤为精彩。该校四百多学生全体都参加了这项表演。
    △许多国际友人到场参观，下午亚洲妇联中的迟罗代表也到会。大会“快讯”上登载了一段国际朋友对体育大会的观感：“不论在节目方面、场地方面，会场布置以及大会工作……等各方面，都十分精彩，很有秩序。”他们很高兴，很喜欢。各种表演和径赛的项目中，他们最喜欢拔河、幼稚园小孩的游戏、障碍赛跑，女同志的运动等。在苏联有这样一句话“小孩就是生活花”，对中国的儿童他们也有同感。（附图片）
