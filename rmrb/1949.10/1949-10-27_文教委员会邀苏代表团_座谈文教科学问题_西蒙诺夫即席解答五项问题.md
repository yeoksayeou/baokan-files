Director Guo Moruo first raised the following questions, requesting answers from the Soviet delegation friends: (1) How does the Soviet government uniformly lead the national cultural and educational work? (2) How many departments does the Soviet government have in the cultural and educational field? Besides the Writers Association, does the government have a specialized agency to lead literary and artistic work? How does it work? (3) Is there an organization like a Cultural and Educational Planning Bureau? What are its functions and powers? (4) The research and organizational situation of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. (5) Specific methods for future exchange of cultural, educational materials and experiences between China and the Soviet Union. These questions were answered in turn by Simonov and others from the Soviet delegation. Everyone present concentrated intently, carefully listening to the opinions of the Soviet friends, and the discussion was extremely lively and harmonious.

    In the morning, the delegation's education workers, accompanied by Liu @, Director of the Beijing Municipal Education Bureau, visited the Beijing Municipal Normal School. In the afternoon, the delegation's art performance team performed wonderful programs in Zhongshan Park to entertain various organizations.
