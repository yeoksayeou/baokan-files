Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 14th: The Central Committee of the Korean Fatherland Unification Democratic Front, on October 11th, sent a letter signed by its chairman, Kim Tu-bong, along with a report on the investigation results of the armed conflict along the 38th Parallel, to UN Secretary-General Lie.

On the 13th, Democratic Korea published an editorial entitled "Smash Syngman Rhee's Gang's Atrocities on the 38th Parallel and Strive for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland," saying: The report completely exposed the crime of the Syngman Rhee puppet government illegally invading the area north of the "38th Parallel" with American weapons, proving that the chief culprit was American officers. At the same time, it exposed the fact that the pseudo "United Nations Commission on Korea" went to the "38th Parallel" to instigate provocative actions by the puppet national defense forces and police. The editorial continued: The Korean people clearly know that the US imperialists are hindering and threatening the peaceful reunification and independence of the fatherland, and the "United Nations Commission on Korea" is a loyal lackey of the United States. The just call of the world for handing over the Korean issue to the Korean people themselves and immediately disbanding the illegal "United Nations Commission on Korea" is growing louder and louder. The provocative actions of the Syngman Rhee traitorous gang and the American aggressors along the "38th Parallel" will only further heighten the vigilance of the Korean people and strengthen their determination to fight for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 14th: According to the Central Committee of the Korean Patriotic Support Association’s announcement on the 12th regarding the situation of the Korean people donating funds to defend the fatherland, since the association's establishment, people from all over the country have donated cash and gold and silver worth a total of 28 million won (Korean currency). In the process of donation, workers and farmers demonstrated a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm. Workers at the Pyongyang Cigarette Factory donated all 110,000 won they earned from exceeding the production plan. Farmer Kim Won-ha of Pyongwon County donated forty bags of rice (one stone per bag). National capitalist Park Chung-sam donated 1.5 million won. The Patriotic Support Association has decided to use this huge sum of money to purchase airplanes and tanks and dedicate them to the People's Army to strengthen the defense of the Republic.

　　朝鲜祖国民主战线中央委员会主席
    金枓奉电联合国秘书长
    控告美帝及其忠实走狗李承晚用美式武器非法侵犯“三八”线
    【新华社平壤十四日电】朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会于十月十一日以该会主席金＠奉签署的函件一封，附以北纬三十八度沿线武装冲突调查结果报告书，电达联合国秘书长莱氏。
    十三日，民主朝鲜报以“粉碎李承晚党徒在三八线的暴行，争取祖国的和平统一”为题，发表社论说：报告书完全揭露了李承晚傀儡政府以美国的武器非法侵犯“三八”线以北地区的罪行，证明了罪魁祸首是美国军官，同时更将伪“联合国朝鲜委员会”到“三八”沿线鼓动伪国防军和警察进行挑拨行为的事实，暴露无遗。社论继称：朝鲜人民清楚地知道，妨碍并威胁祖国和平统一独立的是美帝国主义者，而“联合国朝鲜委员会”则是美国的忠实走狗。全世界主张把朝鲜问题交给朝鲜人民自己解决，立即解散非法的“联合国朝鲜委员会”的正义呼声，日益高涨。李承晚卖国党徒和美国侵略者在“三八”沿线的挑拨行为，只有更加提高朝鲜人民的警惕性，更加坚定他们为实现祖国和平统一而斗争的决心。
    【新华社平壤十四日】据朝鲜保卫祖国后援会中央委员会十二日发表朝鲜人民捐献保卫祖国基金的情形称：在该会成立以来，各地人民已捐献总值达二千八百万圆（朝鲜币）的现款和金银。在捐献过程中，工人农民表现了高度的爱国热忱。平壤纸烟工厂工人，已将超过完成生产计划所得的十一万圆，全部捐出。平原郡农民金元河献出大米四十包（每包小斗一石）。民族资本家朴青三捐了一百五十万元。保卫祖国后援会已决定将此巨款购买飞机坦克，献给人民军，以加强共和国的国防。
