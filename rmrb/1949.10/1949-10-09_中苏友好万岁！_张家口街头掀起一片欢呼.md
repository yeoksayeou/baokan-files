　　Long Live Sino-Soviet Friendship!
    Cheers Erupt in the Streets of Zhangjiakou
    [Zhangjiakou, 3rd dispatch] After the news of the Soviet Union's recognition of our country and the recall of its diplomatic representative from Guangzhou reached Zhangjiakou, everyone who heard it was delighted, unanimously believing that this was another extremely vivid demonstration of the eternal friendship between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union. At 2:00 p.m., the Chahar Daily issued a special edition, which was instantly snatched up. The workers, soldiers, students, and other yangko dance troupes and propaganda teams, who were actively celebrating the founding of the Central People's Government on the streets, immediately picked up the special edition and read it aloud to the masses on the spot. Applause and shouts of "Long Live Sino-Soviet Friendship" immediately resounded in unison. The voice of the person reading the special edition at the Telegraph Bureau was interrupted by the applause of the workers after every sentence. The workers of the North China Electric Power Chahar Branch managed to grab a special edition with great difficulty and immediately posted it on the blackboard bulletin. Workers Li Decun, Ding Yi, and others said: This just act of the friendly Soviet Union is another heavy blow to the imperialists. When the news reached the first meeting of the Second Zhangjiakou People's Representative Conference, which was in session, more than 100 representatives from all walks of life immediately responded with sustained applause, unanimously expressing their firm stand on the side of the Soviet Union and their determination to learn from the Soviet Union's experience in nation-building.

　　中苏友好万岁！
    张家口街头掀起一片欢呼
    【张家口三日电】苏联承认我国并召回广州外交代表的消息传到张家口后，闻者无不欢欣，一致认为这是中苏两大民族永恒友谊又一次极鲜明的显示。下午二时，察哈尔日报发出号外，瞬息被争夺一空。正在活跃街头庆祝中央人民政府成立的工人、战士、学生等各色秧歌队、宣传队，马上拿起号外当场向群众朗诵，鼓掌声、高呼“中苏友好万岁”的口号声，立刻响成一片。电讯局朗读号外者的声音，每一句都被工友们的掌声打断。华北电业察中分公司的工友好容易抢得一张号外，马上把它贴在黑板报上。工友李德村、丁义等说：友邦苏联这一正义行为，对帝国主义者是又一次沉重的打击。消息传到正在开会的张市第二届各界代表会首次会议上，包括各阶层的一百余名代表，立刻报以经久不息的掌声，一致表示坚决站在苏联一边，努力学习苏联建国经验。
