　　[Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 20th] The Soviet Cultural, Artistic and Scientific Workers Delegation departed Shanghai on the evening of the 19th to return to Beijing and then to their home country. Rao Shushi, Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Zeng Shan and Pan Hannian, Deputy Mayors of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, held a cocktail party at 2:30 PM on the 19th to see them off. Those invited to attend included representatives from Shanghai's Party, government, and military organs, workers, peasants, youth, students, women, and cultural, artistic, scientific, and industrial circles, as well as Vladimir, former Soviet diplomatic staff in Shanghai, and Tsibunov, President of the Soviet Overseas Chinese Association, totaling over 300 people. During the banquet, the guests and hosts toasted each other. Rao Shushi, on behalf of the East China and Shanghai people, presented the precious local products created by the people themselves as gifts to Marshal Stalin and each of the delegates. He stood up and said, "Now, we, the liberated East China people and Shanghai people, are taking some of the things created by our own laboring hands as our gifts. Please, Comrade Simonov and the delegates, take them back and give them to our beloved Comrade Stalin, to express the East China people and Shanghai people's admiration and gratitude to Stalin, the leader and teacher of the working people of the world!" Rao Shushi also wished the delegates good health and a safe journey. Then, Simonov, the head of the Soviet delegation, delivered a speech. He first expressed his gratitude, saying, "All our Chinese friends have welcomed us so warmly, showing the most beautiful sincere, friendly concern and hospitality. We are deeply grateful, first of all to Comrade Rao Shushi, Comrade Zeng Shan, and Comrade Pan Hannian, the leaders of Shanghai, who have shown us very friendly care. We hope that those meetings in Shanghai between Soviet cultural representatives and Chinese cultural representatives and social organizations will help further consolidate the cause of friendship between our two great nations and consolidate the cause of our cultural ties." When Rao Shushi personally handed the gifts to Simonov and all the members of the delegation one by one, enthusiastic applause and cheers shook the building. Stoletov said emotionally, "Our days in China have left us with unforgettable memories. We will definitely tell the people of our country when we return. The enthusiasm and care that the Shanghai people have shown to our delegation are also shown to the Soviet people. Our meeting is about to end, let us say 'goodbye'. We hope to see you again soon in Moscow, and we hope to see you again in Shanghai soon. These rich gifts you have given us will leave a permanent memorial of our friendship." The banquet of deep friendship between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union ended in joy at half-past five.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 20th] The Soviet Cultural, Artistic and Scientific Workers Delegation left Shanghai last night to return to Beijing. More than 2,000 representatives from various organs, groups, and all walks of life went to the station to see them off. Red flags fluttered and songs rose at the North Station. From the entrance of the Beijing-Shanghai train to the middle section of the platform, many huge banners in Chinese and Russian were hung, reading: "Thank you for comforting Shanghai!" "Welcome to visit China again!" "Wish you a safe journey!" "Please extend sincere and warm greetings to all your friends in your country!" The large banner across the platform entrance read: "Long live Sino-Soviet friendship and cooperation!" As soon as Simonov and his party entered the North Station, the crowd burst into thunderous applause and cheers, and the military band played music. Simonov and others waved their hands and hats in response, and the crowd also waved their hats and flags wildly, with cheers rising and falling like waves. Rao Shushi, Zeng Shan, Pan Hannian and others came out to the platform to greet them and accompanied them onto the platform. Seventeen students from a Chinese and Western girls' middle school presented flowers to Simonov and others. Representatives from all walks of life who had been waiting on the platform shook hands with Simonov and others to say goodbye. At 7:10, the special train started, and the Soviet friends still leaned on the train windows to shake hands with everyone continuously, filled with reluctance. Traveling back to Beijing on the same train as the Soviet delegation were poet Xiao San and Li Bozhao, head of the Youth Art Troupe for Foreign Performances, and all the members of the troupe.
