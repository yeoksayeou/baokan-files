　　Life of Siamese Women
    Siam is an agricultural country in the Indochina Peninsula of southern Asia. The country has a population of fourteen and a half million, and its main agricultural product is rice, producing approximately 4.5 million tons annually. Rice exports account for two-thirds of Siam's total export value each year. Agricultural production in Siam mainly relies on the labor of women. According to official statistics from the Siamese government in 1941, more than half of Siam's agricultural labor force is female. In the eastern, northeastern, and southern regions of Siam, rural production, from cultivation to harvesting, is mostly carried out by women. Among the Lao people in the central region, all farm work is done by women. In the northern region, most women participate in rural sideline production, such as weaving, making umbrellas, and pottery. Besides agricultural labor, Siamese rural women also take care of household chores. Despite their hard work, Siamese women still struggle to get enough to eat under the oppression and exploitation of the landlord class and imperialist forces. In some areas, they cannot even afford clothes.

    Siam has about 130,000 workers nationwide, of which more than 33,000 are female. The number of female workers is increasing daily in many industrial sectors. In recent years, many Siamese women have also been working in the railway transportation sector, such as female workers engaged in transportation at train stations and female carpenters in train repair factories who are responsible for repairing train carriages. In the construction industry, there are female workers engaged in rebar tying for building houses. Female workers account for one-third of all male workers in arsenals, and three-quarters of the workers in cigarette factories are female. The increasing number of female workers indicates the increased exploitation of the Siamese working class by Siamese capitalists, because female workers perform the same labor as male workers but receive much lower wages, sometimes less than half of what male workers earn. As for the intellectual women who work as clerks in Siamese government agencies, they are treated as mere ornaments by the reactionary ruling authorities of Siam. Moreover, the reactionary ruling authorities of Siam have stipulated that married women are not allowed to work in government agencies. Therefore, Siamese women have no political status whatsoever.

    The women's movement in Siam began during World War II. The earliest women's organizations were mostly initiated by upper-class women and university students. The so-called women's work here was nothing more than opposing prostitution, holding group weddings, and beauty contests, etc. Not only did this essentially become a facade for the aristocracy, landlords, and bourgeoisie, and had nothing to do with the fundamental interests of the majority of women, especially working women, but things like beauty contests were vile acts of the Siamese landlord bourgeoisie to play with and humiliate Siamese women.

    However, a conscious struggle for women's liberation also exists in Siam. After the Japanese surrendered in 1945, the forces of American and British imperialism re-entered Siam, and Phibun's fascist group sold themselves out as lackeys to American and British imperialism. In November 1947, a coup d'état took place in Siam. Phibun, a Siamese traitor who had been ousted from power after the Japanese surrender, reorganized a traitorous puppet military government with the support of American and British imperialism and continued his criminal rule of exploiting and oppressing the Siamese people. The reactionary Phibun government of Siam forcibly purchased rice from farmers at 30 percent below market prices, and then exported it abroad at high prices. According to 1948 statistics, Siam exported more than 700,000 tons of rice in a year, and the reactionary Phibun government made a net profit of 1.22 billion baht in Siamese currency, while many Siamese people had no rice to eat as a result.

    In order to suppress the people's resistance to it, and to numb the minds of the Siamese people, the reactionary Phibun government wanted Siamese women to sacrifice their freedom, give full play to their so-called great "motherhood," return to their families, advocate women's beauty contests, specialize in raising children, and not interfere in political and social affairs. In short, they wanted women to obediently be slaves and playthings of the Siamese landlord bourgeoisie. However, after long-term anti-imperialist struggles and the tempering of the Anti-Japanese War, the masses of Siamese women have gradually become stronger. The "Thammasat University Women's Association," established in 1947, was the first to propose fighting for the liberation of oppressed Siamese women and children. Three months before Phibun's November coup, women representing all strata of society organized the "Siamese Women's Federation," calling for the promotion of solidarity among women in Southeast Asian countries and carrying out women's welfare undertakings. Weaving will certainly not be an exception. However, Siamese women have now awakened, and no amount of pressure can stop them from advancing. After being sabotaged by the reactionary government, the "Thammasat University Women's Association" still participated in the Thammasat University strike. They held lectures, calling on Siamese women to actively participate in political movements, carry out anti-imperialist struggles, and oppose the Phibun reactionary government's plot to sell out the interests of the Siamese people. Ms. Cha-em, the chairman of the "Siamese Women's Federation," was recently arrested by the reactionary government. The members of the Siamese Women's Federation have moved underground to continue their activities. The Siamese Women's Federation remains a force leading the struggle of Siamese women today.

### 暹逻妇女生活

　　暹逻妇女生活
    暹逻是亚洲南部印度支那半岛上的一个农业国家，这个国家有一千四五百万人口，出产的农产品主要是大米，大概每年出产四百五十万吨。每年大米的出口占暹逻全部出口总值的三分之二。暹逻的农业生产主要是依靠妇女的劳动。根据一九四一年暹逻政府的官方统计，暹逻从事农业劳动人口有一半以上是妇女、在暹逻的东部、东北部和南部等地区，农村生产，从耕地到收割，大部分都是由妇女担任；中部的佬族，全部农场工作都由妇女担任；北部的妇女多数都参加农村的副业生产，比如织布，做雨伞和烧制陶器等等。暹逻的农村妇女除了从事农业劳动以外，还要料理家务。虽然暹逻妇女这样积极劳动，可是在地主阶级和帝国主义势力的压迫剥削下，一年辛苦到头，还是吃不饱饭，甚至有些地方的妇女连衣服也穿不上。
    暹逻全国共有十三万左右的工人，其中女工占三万三千多人。而在许多工业部门里面，女工还正在一天一天增多，近几年来，暹逻妇女在铁路运输部门从事劳动的也不少，比如有在火车站从事运输工作的女工，有在火车修理工厂担任修理火车厢木匠的女工。在建筑业中，有从事建筑房屋扎铁的女工。兵工厂里的女工占到全部男工的三分之一，卷烟工厂里的工人四分之三是女工。女工的增多，说明了暹逻资本家对暹逻工人阶级剥削的加重，因为女工和男工同样劳动，而工资则比男工的少得多，有的还不到男工工资的一半。至于那些在暹逻政府机关做职员的知识分子妇女，她们完全被暹的反动统治当局当做装饰品看待。而且暹逻的反动统当治局还作了这样的规定：凡是结了婚的妇女就不许在政府机关担任工作。因此，暹逻妇女在政治上也是毫无地位的。
    暹逻的妇女运动开始在第二次世界大战时期，最初的妇女组织差不多都是上层妇女和大学女生搞起来的。这里的所谓妇女工作，不过是反对娼妓，举办集团结婚和赛美会等等，这不仅在本质上成为贵族、地主，和资产阶级装璜门面的东西，和多数妇女群众，特别是劳动妇女群众的根本利益毫不相关，而且象赛美会之类的事情，乃是暹逻地主资产阶级玩弄污辱暹逻妇女的丑行。
    但是在暹逻也同时存在着自觉的妇女解放斗争。一九四五年日寇投降以后，美英帝国主义的势力再度侵入了暹逻，銮披汶的法西斯集团又卖身投靠作了美英帝国主义的走狗。在一九四七年十一月，在暹逻发生了一个政变，曾经因为日寇投降而随着下台的暹奸銮披汶，在美英帝国主义的支持下，重新组织了卖国的傀儡军政府，继续其剥削和压迫暹逻人民的罪恶统治。暹逻反动的銮披汶政府用低于市价百分之三十的价格，向农民强制收买白米，然后再以高价向国外输出。据一九四八年的统计，暹逻一年输出了大米七十多万吨，銮披汶反动政府从中净赚了暹逻币十二亿二千万铢，而许多暹逻人民却因此没有米吃了。
    反动的銮披汶政府，为了镇压人民对它的反抗，为了麻痹暹逻人民的思想，要暹逻妇女牺牲自由，发挥所谓伟大的“母性”，要妇女回到家庭去，提倡妇女赛美，专门养育儿女，不要过问政治和社会的事情。总之，就是要妇女老老实实的作暹逻地主资产阶级的奴隶和玩弄品。可是，经过了长期反帝斗争，抗日斗争锻炼的暹逻的妇女群众已渐渐坚强起来了。一九四七年成立的“法政大学妇女会”，首先提出要为被压迫的暹逻妇女儿童的解放而奋斗。在銮披汶十一月政变的前三个月，就有代表各阶层的妇女组织了“暹逻妇女联合会”，号召促进东南亚各国妇女的团结，进行妇女的福利事业。织当然也不会例外的。但是，今天的暹逻妇女已经觉醒了，任何压力都阻挡不住她们的前进。“法政大学妇女会”，在受到反动政府的破坏以后，仍然参加了法政大学的罢课斗争。他们召开了讲演会，号召暹逻妇女积极参加政治运动，进行反帝国主义的斗争，反对銮披汶反动政府出卖暹逻人民利益的阴谋。“暹逻妇女联合会”的主席差恩女士最近被反动政府逮捕了，暹逻妇女联合会的会员们，就转到地下去活动，暹逻妇女联合会今天仍然是一个领导暹逻妇女斗争的力量。
