	Patient Serum Therapy Proves Effective
	Burning Fleas
	Rat Catching Should Proceed from Near to Far

Since the outbreak of plague in Chahar, it has attracted widespread attention from all sectors of society. Yesterday, the 37-member epidemic prevention team of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government Health Department, at the call of the North China People's Government, rushed from Ulanhot to Beijing overnight, and is about to go to the epidemic area to work. The reporter specifically interviewed their captain, Samubulazhabu, and Deputy Minister of Health, Hu Erqin, on the day the team arrived.

What to fight?
	Rats · Fleas · Plague Bacillus

The Inner Mongolia Epidemic Prevention Team was established in 1947 and has more than 150 members. The 37 members who came to Beijing this time are divided into a laboratory group, a rat-catching group, a disinfection group, and a treatment group. They told me in a firm tone: The objects of the plague struggle are rats, fleas, and plague bacilli. According to Soviet experience, there are an average of fifty or sixty fleas on each rat. Germ-carrying rats generally pose a greater risk from domestic rats than wild rats. There are five types of plague: bubonic plague, septicemic plague, pneumonic plague (i.e., pneumonia plague), cutaneous plague, and ocular plague. In the Northeast, bubonic plague is more common. A person's health condition, the number of bacteria, and the strength of the virulence are also related to whether or not they can recover. Bubonic plague and cutaneous plague, if discovered early (within one or two days), have an 80% or higher chance of recovery. Septicemic plague is more difficult to treat, and pneumonic plague, according to this year's experience, has a phenomenon of death even after being cured. There is currently no good medical way to deal with this disease. When we were in Inner Mongolia, based on Soviet experience, we injected patients with sulfonamides, cardiotonics, and stibamine, all of which had considerable effects. In 1947, a serum therapy using recovered patients was tested in Wangyemiao, that is, the blood was drawn from patients 20 days after recovery, and after testing proved that there were no bacteria and deformed bacteria, the serum was separated and injected into the sick patients. This method unexpectedly received good results. Since the adoption of this patient serum therapy, all patients who developed the disease after August in Wangyemiao have recovered, and no one has died. However, since no plague occurred in Ulanhot in 1948 and 1949, it was not used continuously. This time, we are going to Chahar to prepare to use this therapy again.

Rat catching and flea extermination are very important in prevention work. In Inner Mongolia, wherever this disease has occurred, prevention work began in May and June of each year and did not stop until October and November. But experience has proven that this is still inappropriate and that regular rat extermination and environmental sanitation work should be done all year round. Generally speaking, when we carry out epidemic prevention, the first thing we do is catch rats and kill fleas. There is a kind of large gray rat that likes bright places, so the villagers light torches at night, and the gray rat follows behind, making it very easy to eliminate it. In addition, there are dozens of types of rat traps, which also have some effect. The second is to spray DDT or insecticide powder and sprinkle quicklime to kill fleas. But because the price is more expensive, it is not easy to do under the current economic conditions, so we all use fire to burn them. The method is to move the furniture of each household outdoors and spread four inches of grass on the ground and kangs in the house and burn it with fire, and the fleas will be eliminated. However, be careful not to spread the grass too thinly, because flea eggs are mostly in the soil and are not easily burned to death. This is the valuable experience introduced to us by Soviet epidemic prevention team comrades. Secondly, attention should be paid to wells, cesspools, etc., and it is best to cover them up. In the early days, the villagers did not do a good job of catching rats. Some people went to the fields to catch rats in order to complete the tasks assigned by the epidemic prevention team, while ignoring the rats in their homes. Later, we proposed that rat catching should be from the inside to the outside, from near to far, and repeatedly sweep through.

Urban and rural masses
	Popularize the establishment of health groups to strictly inspect pedestrians

Speaking of this, they said to me seriously: Plague prevention and control is a very arduous mass work. Only by using the power of the masses to protect the health of the masses can we achieve results. In Inner Mongolia, we initially made this work a regular thing, and we must carry out rat catching and flea extermination at any time. We dug large epidemic prevention ditches outside the village and concentrated the livestock outside the village. The crops harvested in autumn were also concentrated outside the village, so that wild rats would not run into the village. Because the masses in all cities and villages are organized into groups of ten households, and a health group leader is selected for each group, the epidemic prevention team convenes the group leaders every night to explain epidemic prevention knowledge and methods, etc. The group leaders then convene each household to convey the information, and the masses gradually raise their awareness, which is of great help in promoting epidemic prevention work. This is an experience of mobilizing and organizing the masses that has been derived from exploration. In some places in Inner Mongolia, everyone must carry out five minutes of cleaning every morning, which has naturally become a habit. All lodgings or transactions must have a vaccination certificate to be allowed to pass. The children's corps are very serious about checking pedestrians, and a person will often be sent for vaccination after being checked station by station. It is impossible to avoid it. In short, this work can only be done well on the basis of universally mobilizing and organizing the masses.

Whether the plague can be quickly eradicated depends on the blockade and encirclement

As for places where epidemics have already occurred, it is necessary to first understand the route of transmission, and secondly, to carry out the environmental cleaning work mentioned above, such as disinfection and vaccination, and to surround and blockade the epidemic area, absolutely not allowing passage. This is the key to whether or not the epidemic bacteria can continue to spread. Patients must be immediately isolated and sealed off, and then treated; the patient's family members must also be isolated separately. In this regard, Soviet friends introduced us to a good experience, that is, the patient's family members should not be concentrated together, but should be isolated separately. All houses where patients have lived or things they have come into contact with must be thoroughly disinfected before they can be used.

Finally, the two comrades of the epidemic prevention team told me that although plague is a terrible disease and deserves our high vigilance, we must not panic and think it is extremely serious. As long as we listen to the guidance of the epidemic prevention team and other relevant departments, do a good job of catching rats, killing fleas, cleaning up hygiene, especially vaccination work, and support the government's measures to blockade and encircle the epidemic area and isolate patients, we will achieve the expected results. The plague in Chahar this time, I believe, under the leadership of the Central People's Government, coupled with the support of the broad masses of people, will definitely be eradicated.

　　访问内蒙防疫队

    患者血清疗法证明效果良好            
    火烧跳蚤　
    捕鼠要由近及远
    察北发生鼠疫后，已引起社会各阶层的普遍注意。昨天内蒙古自治政府卫生部防疫队三十七人应华北人民政府电召，从乌兰浩特星夜赶到北京，即将前往疫区工作。记者特于该队到达的当日，访问了他们的队长萨木卜拉扎布和卫生部副部长胡尔钦。
    和什么斗争？　
    鼠·蚤·鼠疫菌
    内蒙防疫队成立于一九四七年，共有队员一百五十余人。此次到京的三十七人中，共分为化验组、捕鼠组、消毒组和治疗组。他们以坚定的语气向我说：鼠疫斗争的对象是老鼠、跳蚤和鼠疫菌。据苏联的经验证明，平均每只老鼠身上有五、六十个跳蚤。保菌鼠一般以家鼠的危险性比野鼠大。鼠疫共有腺鼠疫、鼠疫败血症、肺鼠疫（即肺炎鼠疫）、皮肤鼠疫和眼鼠疫五种，在东北则以腺鼠疫较普遍。一个人的健康情形、菌的多少和毒力的强弱与能否痊愈也有相当关系。腺鼠疫和皮肤鼠疫若在早期（一、二天内）发现，有百分之八十以上痊愈的机会，败血鼠疫较难治，肺鼠疫据今年的经验是治好后，又有死亡的现象。现在医学上还没有对付这种病的良好办法，我们在内蒙时，根据苏联的经验，曾给病人注射过磺胺、强心针及石美兰，均发生相当效果。一九四七年在王爷庙曾试验用恢复期患者血清疗法，就是将病愈二十几天后的病人的血抽出，经化验证明没有病菌及变形菌，然后将血清分离出来注射到病患者的身上，这一方法意外地收到良好的效果。自采用此种患者血清疗法后，王爷庙八月以后发生的病人都痊愈了，无一人死亡。但自一九四八与一九四九年在乌市没有发生鼠疫，未继续使用。这一次到察北去准备再用这一疗法。
    捕鼠灭蚤在防预工作上是非常重要的。在内蒙凡是发生过这种病症的地方，过去在每年的五、六月便开始进行预防工作，直到十、十一月终了才停止。但经验证明这样还是不妥当的，应当一年四季都要作经常的灭鼠和环境卫生的工作。一般说来，我们进行防疫时，首先是捕鼠灭蚤，有一种大灰鼠，喜欢有亮光的地方，老乡们便在夜间燃着火把，灰鼠便跟在后面，这样甚易将它消灭，此外还有几十种捕鼠器，也有些作用。其次是喷射ＤＤＴ或驱虫粉，撒生石灰，以消灭跳蚤。但因价钱较贵，在现时的经济条件下，还不易作到，因之都采用火烧。办法是将每一人家的家具等搬到屋外，在家里的地上、炕上铺上四寸厚的草，用火来烧，跳蚤便消灭了。不过应注意不要将草铺得过薄，因为蚤卵多在土中，不易烧死。这是苏联防疫队同志介绍给我们的宝贵经验。再其次对于水井、粪坑等处均应注意，最好能盖起来。在初期的时候，老乡捕鼠作得不好，有人为了完成防疫队所分配的任务，到野外去捕鼠，而忽略了家庭的老鼠。以后我们便提出捕鼠要由里向外，由近及远，反复扫荡。
    城乡群众  
    普建卫生小组严密检查行人
    谈到这里，他们严肃地向我说：防治鼠疫是一件很艰巨的群众工作，只有用群众的力量来保护群众的健康，才能收到效果。我们在内蒙初步地把这一工作作成了一件经常的事情，随时要进行捕鼠、灭蚤，在屯外挖大防疫沟，将牲口集中喂在屯外，秋收的庄稼也集中放在屯外，这样才不致使野鼠跑到村子里去。由于在各城市乡村都将群众按十户组织起来，每一组选出一卫生小组长，防疫队每晚召集组长讲解防疫常识和办法等，组长回去后再召集每一户来传达，群众渐渐提高了觉悟，对于推动防疫工作有很大帮助。这是从摸索中间得出来的一条发动组织群众的经验。在内蒙有些地方，人人每日早晨必须进行五分钟的清扫，已很自然地成了习惯。凡投宿或交易等都要有注射证，才可以通行。儿童团执行检查行人，是非常认真的，一个人往往经过一站一站的检查后，一定会把你送去注射，要脱漏是不可能的。总之只有在普遍发动和组织起群众的基础上才能作好这一工作。
    鼠疫能否迅速扑灭关键在于封锁包围
    至于在已经发生疫病的地方，必须先了解传染的经路，其次就要进行上面讲的消毒、注射等环境清洁工作，并将疫区包围封锁起来，绝对不让通行，这一点是疫菌能否继续蔓延的关键。对于患者要立刻隔离封锁，再进行治疗；对于患者的家属也要单独隔离。在这一方面，苏联朋友介绍给我们良好的经验，就是不应将患者的家属集中在一起，而要分别隔离。凡是病人住过的家屋，或接触过的东西都要彻底消毒，才能使用。
    最后防疫队的两位同志告诉我，鼠疫虽然是一种可怕的病症，值得我们高度警惕，但千万不要惊慌失措，认为严重得不得了。只要我们听从防疫队等有关部门的指导，好好进行捕鼠、灭蚤、清洁卫生，尤其是注射的工作，并赞助政府对疫区封锁包围、对患者隔离的措施，就会收到预期的效果。此次察北的鼠疫相信在中央人民政府的领导下，加上广大人民的支持，一定能够扑灭的。
