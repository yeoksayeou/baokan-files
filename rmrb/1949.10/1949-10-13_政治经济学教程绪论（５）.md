  　The Object, Task, and Characteristics of Political Economy Research
        Chapter One: Mode of Production
        Section One: Productive Forces
    People create, use, and improve tools to suit the needs and convenience of various human labors and works, and to improve efficiency. For example, humans initially used hands as natural knives, but the invention of stone knives and later metal knives was a step or several steps more efficient than using hands. However, different labors and different works require different knives as tools, so people create and use all kinds of knives that are suitable and convenient for various different labors and works. For example, a paper cutter is used for cutting paper, scissors are used for cutting clothes, a kitchen knife is used for cutting vegetables, a sickle is used for reaping, a chaff cutter is used for cutting grass, a butcher knife is used for slaughtering cattle, an anatomical knife is used for human physiological dissection, etc. The styles are different, and the uses and effects are different. Therefore, the ancients said: "If a worker wants to do a good job, he must first sharpen his tools." Some people have also said: "Why use a butcher knife to kill a chicken?", which illustrates that the creation, use, and improvement of tools (implements) are prerequisites for doing labor work (things) well, and also illustrates that various different tools have various different functions.
    Therefore, the creation, use, and improvement of means of labor are all adapted to the needs and convenience of people's labor work, and they can all improve and develop productivity and productive forces. They are "realized by people who are related to production, not unrelated to people" (A Short History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), Chapter 4, Section 2).
    Changes and Developments in Production Begin with the Means of Labor
    The creation and use of means of labor enabled mankind to break away from the animal kingdom and enter mankind. Historically, the changes and developments in human society's production have also begun with the changes and developments in the means of labor. From the primitive age of human society to today, humans have used stone tools, metal tools (primitive and improved), simple machines, and even modern precision machines. At the same time, with the development of the means of labor, human society has also experienced from the primitive collection period to the hunting period, from the hunting period to the primitive animal husbandry period of domesticating animals, from primitive animal husbandry to the agricultural production period of planting plants; from agricultural production to the development of handicraft production, handicrafts broke away from agriculture and became independent, forming independent handicrafts and the later factory handicraft production period; and finally from factory handicraft to machine industrial production, and then to the emergence of machine systems and modern mechanized industry. Therefore, the means of labor are constantly changing and developing, the productive forces are also constantly changing and developing, and society is also constantly changing and developing. (Refer to A Short History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), Chapter 4, Section 2)
    Means of Labor are a Sign of the Division of Social Economic Eras
    However, after the means of labor are created, they must be popularized and used in order to improve and develop social productive forces, and in order to have a major promotion effect on society. Therefore, what means of labor humans use, how they labor, what means of labor they use to produce, and under what mode they produce? It is a sign of the division of human social economic eras, and it can be seen the degree, stage, and social productive forces development of human social development. Therefore, Marx once said:
    "The remains of the means of labor have the same importance for judging the economic structures of extinct societies as the structure of skeletal remains for recognizing the organization of extinct animal species. It is not what is made that distinguishes different economic epochs, but how and with what instruments of labor it is made. Instruments of labor are not only a measure of the degree of development of human labor power, but also an index of the social relations under which labor is carried on." (Capital, Volume 1, Part 3, Chapter 5)
    When Tools Develop into Machines, Productive Forces Obtain Unprecedented Development
    When tools develop into machines, productive forces obtain leapfrog development, and the development of productive forces is particularly prominent, increasing productivity by several times, dozens of times, hundreds of times, or even thousands or tens of thousands of times, obtaining unprecedented development. For example, a hand-cranked spinning wheel can only crank one spindle, but the spinning machine of Shijiazhuang Daxing Yarn Factory can drive two hundred and eighty-eight spindles with one spinning machine. For example, comparing the weight carried by shoulder with the load capacity of vehicles, a person can generally only carry fifty or sixty pounds on their shoulders, at most one hundred pounds. However, a human-powered flatbed cart can carry about three hundred pounds. An animal-powered cart, with ordinary livestock and double-harnessed iron-wheeled carts, can carry one thousand to one thousand and two hundred pounds, and good livestock can carry about one thousand and five hundred pounds. A double-harnessed automobile-wheeled cart with better livestock can carry up to two thousand four hundred to two thousand five hundred pounds. The load capacity of automobiles ranges from three tons (such as Japanese small six-wheeled trucks), three and a half tons (small Dodge) to six tons (large ten-wheeled trucks), that is, from about five thousand five hundred pounds to eleven thousand pounds. Railway cars are loaded approximately by 10 tons, 15 tons, 20 tons, 30 tons, 40 tons and 45 tons (all metric tons), i.e., from approximately 20,000 pounds to 90,000 pounds. As for a locomotive's tractive power, the weight of its ordinary accumulative net load of goods is 600 metric tons, i.e., approximately 1,200,000 pounds. Large locomotives can tow up to 1,500 metric tons. As for speed, manpower, tools, and machines are incomparable. For example, a person walking can generally travel 60 Chinese miles (approximately 30 kilometers) a day, at most 120 Chinese miles (approximately 70 kilometers). An iron-wheeled cart can also travel no more than 100 Chinese miles to 120 Chinese miles (approximately 57 kilometers to 70 kilometers). A rubber-wheeled cart with a double team of mules has a normal speed and a top speed of 12 Chinese miles to 15 Chinese miles per hour, with an average of 140 to 180 Chinese miles per day (approximately 80 kilometers to 105 kilometers). An automobile's normal speed reaches 30 kilometers per hour, approximately 52 Chinese miles, and the fastest speed now reaches 50 kilometers, approximately 87 Chinese miles. According to the materials of the Northeast Railway Administration, the daily standard for trains is 422 kilometers, i.e., approximately 734 Chinese miles, and the highest daily speed reaches 748.8 kilometers, i.e., approximately 1,283 Chinese miles. Looking at the results obtained from cultivating land using different means of labor, it can also be seen that the productivity of machines is much higher than that of tools:

　　政治经济学教程绪论（５）
    王学文
  　政治经济学的研究对象任务及其特点
        第一章　生产方式
        第一节　生产力
    人们创造使用与改良工具，都是为了适合人类的各种劳动与各种工作的需要和便利，都是为了提高效率。例如人最初以手为天然的刀子，但以后发明石刀，以至金属刀子就比手的效率进了一步或数步。但各种不同的劳动与不同的工作需要各种不同的刀子做工具，因此人们就创造使用适合于和便利于各种不同劳动不同工作的各式各种的刀子。例如裁纸要用裁纸刀，裁衣要用剪刀，切菜要用切菜刀，刈割要用镰刀，切草要用铡刀，杀牛要用牛刀，人身生理解剖要用解剖刀等等，式样不同，用途功效各异，故古人云：“工欲善其事，必先利其器”。并且也有人这样说过：“割鸡焉用牛刀”，说明着工具（器）的创造使用与改良，是劳动工作（事）做好的先决条件，同时也说明着各种不同的工具都是有着各种不同的功用。
    所以，劳动手段的创造使用和改良，都是适应着人们劳动工作的需要和方便，它们都是可以提高与发展生产率与生产力的。它们是“由与生产有关系的人们所实现，而不是与人们无关”（联共（布）党史简明教程第四章第二节）。
    生产的变更发展首先从劳动手段开始
    创造使用劳动手段，使人类本身脱离动物界而进至人类。历史上人类社会生产的变更发展，也首先是从劳动手段的变动和发展开始。从人类社会的原始时代一直到今天，人类曾经使用过石器工具，金属工具（原始的和改良的），简单机器，以至现代的精密的机器。同时人类社会随着劳动手段的发展，也就经历了从原始的采集时期到狩猎时期，由狩猎时期到驯养动物的原始牧畜的时期，由原始牧畜过渡到种植植物的农业生产时期；由农业生产过渡到手工业生产的发展，手工业脱离农业而独立，形成独立手工业与以后的工厂手工业生产的时期；最后由工厂手工业进为机器工业的生产，再进而过渡到机器体系以及现代机器化工业的出现。故劳动手段不断地变化发展，生产力也不断地变化发展，社会也随着不断地变化发展。（参照联共（布）党史简明教程第四章第二节）
    劳动手段是社会经济时代划分的标志
    但劳动手段创造出来以后，必须能够普及使用，才能够提高与发展社会生产力，才能够对社会发生重大推动促进作用。因此人类使用什么劳动手段，怎样进行劳动，使用什么劳动手段进行生产，在什么方式下进行生产？是人类社会经济时代划分的标志，可以看出人类社会发展的程度、阶段和社会生产力发展的情况。所以马克思曾经这样说过：
    “劳动手段的遗物，对已经灭亡的社会经济构造的判断，和认识遗骨的构造对已经绝灭的动物种属的身体的组织，具有同样的重要。同以划分各种经济时代的，不是制造了些什么，而是怎样地，并用怎样的劳动手段来制造的。劳动手段不仅是人类劳动力发展的测度器，而且是劳动在它下面进行的社会关系的指示器。”（资本论第一卷第三篇第五章）
    工具发展到机器，生产力获得空前的发展
    工具发展到机器，生产力获得飞跃的发展，生产力的发展显得特别的突出，生产力提高到几倍，几十倍，几百倍，以至于几千几万倍，获得空前的发展。例如手摇纺车一个人只能摇一个纺锤，石家庄大兴纱厂纺机，一架纺机可以带动二百八十八个纺锤。又如以肩挑分量与车辆的载重量比较，肩挑一个人一般只能挑五、六十斤，最多一百斤。但人力排子车一人拉的约可拉三百斤。畜力大车，普通牲口双套铁轮车能载重一千至一千二百斤，好牲口约一千五百斤，牲口较好的双套汽车轮大车载重可达二千四百至二千五百斤。汽车的载重量则自三吨（如日本小六轮货车）、三吨半（小道奇）至六吨（大十轮），即约自五千五百斤至一万一千斤。火车载重约计分一○吨、一五吨、二○吨、三○吨、四○吨、四五吨（均为公吨）等，即约自二万斤至九万斤。至一台机车一般的普通的牵引力，其积载净货重量则为六百公吨，即约一百二十万斤。大机车可牵引到一千五百公吨，至于行速，人力、工具与机器比较也都是不可比拟，例如人力步行一日一般为六十华里（约合三十公里），最多一百二十华里（约合七十公里），铁轮大车也不过是一百华里至一百二十华里（约合五十七公里至七十公里），胶轮大车双套骡车每小时普通行速与最高行速为十二华里至十五华里，每日平均为一百四十至一百八十华里（约八十公里至一○五公里）。汽车每小时普通速度即达三十公里，约五十二华里，现在最快速度则达五十公里，约八十七华里。而火车的日行标准，据东北铁路管理局的材料，达四二二公里，即约七百三十四华里，最高日行速度达七四八·八公里，即约达一千二百八十三华里。再从使用不同劳动手段耕地所获的结果来看，也可以看到机器的生产力较诸工具要高出多多了：
