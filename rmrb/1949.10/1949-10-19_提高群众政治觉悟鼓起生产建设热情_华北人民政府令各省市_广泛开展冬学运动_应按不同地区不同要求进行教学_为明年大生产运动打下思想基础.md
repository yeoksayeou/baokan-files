[This report] In order to vigorously launch the winter study movement, the North China People's Government issued an order on the 15th of this month to the people's governments of all provinces and cities and all directly affiliated units, stating: Due to the establishment of the People's Republic of China and the Central People's Government, the People's Liberation Army has continuously achieved new and great victories, and the North China region has already begun peaceful construction work, the enthusiasm of the masses is unprecedentedly high, and there is a universal demand for learning. Now that the slack farming season in winter is approaching, all provinces and cities should vigorously lead the widespread and enthusiastic launch of the winter study movement in rural areas. The central task of this year's winter study is: to universally carry out political education and production education in both old and new areas. Further enhance the political consciousness of the masses, inspire the masses' enthusiasm and confidence in production and construction, successfully complete winter work, consolidate North China, and prepare the foundation for next year's great production movement. Secondly, according to different regions, different key points should be specified in combination with the local central work in winter and the needs of the masses. For example, in areas where land reform has ended, emphasis should be placed on organizing young people to learn literacy and culture, learn scientific knowledge of production and hygiene, and carry out education on the people's democratic dictatorship in combination with the work of building political power. In areas where land reform is being carried out, emphasis should be placed on enlightening the class consciousness of peasants, carrying out education on land reform policies, while grasping production, and in combination with public security work, exposing the conspiracies of the US-Chiang Kai-shek clique, raising the vigilance of the masses, and paying attention to preventing special agents and bandits. In disaster areas, it should be combined with production and disaster relief work, focusing on education on production for self-relief. In addition, various places may put forward different requirements according to different situations and possible conditions, avoiding generalization. The organizational forms and teaching methods of winter studies should be flexible, and the educational content must be combined with work, focusing on practicality. Correctly implement the mass line, organize the masses to attend winter studies, and prevent formalism and coercive command styles. Various places can also select a number of key villages, seize the time to exchange experiences, exchange information, and lead the winter study movement in the whole region in a planned way to seek widespread development. It is hoped that you will quickly make specific arrangements based on the "Outline for the Implementation of the Winter Study Movement" (see another article), and earnestly help the masses solve problems such as teaching materials, teachers, and funding, and vigorously carry out this work.

　　提高群众政治觉悟鼓起生产建设热情
  　华北人民政府令各省市
    广泛开展冬学运动
    应按不同地区不同要求进行教学
  　为明年大生产运动打下思想基础
    【本报讯】华北人民政府为大力开展冬学运动，于本月十五日令各省市人民政府及各直属单位称：由于中华人民共和国及中央人民政府的成立，人民解放军不断取得新的伟大胜利，以及华北区已经开始了和平建设工作，群众情绪空前高涨，普遍有学习要求。现冬季农闲季节就要到来，各省、市应大力领导在农村广泛热烈的开展冬学运动。今年冬学的中心任务是：无论老区新区普遍地进行政治教育与生产教育。进一步提高群众的政治觉悟，鼓舞群众生产建设的热忱和信心，胜利完成冬季工作，巩固华北，为明年的大生产运动准备基础。其次是按不同地区，结合当地冬季中心工作与群众需要，分别规定不同的重点。如：土改已结束地区，应着重组织青年识字学文化，学习生产与卫生的科学知识，结合建政工作，进行人民民主专政的教育。在进行土地改革的地区，应着重启发农民阶级觉悟，进行土改政策教育，同时抓紧生产，并结合治安工作，揭发美蒋阴谋，提高群众警惕，注意防特防匪。在灾区则应与生产救灾工作结合，着重进行生产自救的教育。此外各地可视不同情况与可能条件提出不同的要求，避免一般化。冬学的组织形式和教学方法要灵活，教育内容必须结合工作，着重实用。正确的执行群众路线，组织群众上冬学，防止形式主义和强迫命令的作风。各地并可选择若干重点村，随时抓紧交流经验，互通情报，有计划地领导全区冬学运动求得广泛的开展。望即根据“冬学运动实施纲要”（见另文）迅速分别具体布置，并认真帮助群众解决教材、教员、经费等问题，大力开展这一工作。
