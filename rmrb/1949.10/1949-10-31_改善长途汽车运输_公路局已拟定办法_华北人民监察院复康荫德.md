　　Improving Long-Distance Bus Transportation
　　Highway Bureau Formulates Measures
　　North China People's Supervisory Council Replies to Kang Yinde
　　[This Newspaper] The North China People's Supervisory Council issued a letter on the 28th of this month replying to Kang Yinde regarding suggestions for improving long-distance bus transportation. The original letter is recorded below:

Comrade Kang Yinde:

Regarding your reflection on September 30th concerning the potential dangers of mixing passengers and goods on long-distance buses, this Council has written to the North China Highway Bureau to find ways to improve the situation. The Bureau replied stating that the mixed loading of passengers and goods is due to the current shortage of passenger cars in various transportation companies. Now, the Bureau has put forward specific improvement suggestions based on the actual situation: (1) The existing sedan-style passenger cars of each company should be used exclusively as passenger cars. Except for small pieces of luggage carried by passengers that do not hinder other passengers, no other goods may be loaded; (2) Using trucks for mixed passenger and cargo loading is to reduce empty tonnage, but the number of passengers carried should not be too large, and each should have a seat. The cargo load should be lower than the truck bed, and passengers are not allowed to ride on top of the driver's cab, extend their legs out of the vehicle, or grab onto the side of the vehicle; (3) When loading a full load of goods, the height, width, and length must be handled in accordance with passenger and freight transportation regulations. Except for escorts, passengers shall not be allowed to ride along; (4) Regarding the management of commercial vehicles, there are many problems before unified management is achieved. In addition to drafting implementation measures and submitting them to higher authorities for approval, the Bureau has instructed various transportation companies to separately study improvements and pay close attention.

North China People's Supervisory Council, October 28th

　　改善长途汽车运输　
    公路局已拟定办法　
    华北人民监察院复康荫德
    【本报讯】华北人民监察院于本月二十八日发出答复康荫德关于建议改善长途汽车运输事项的信一件，兹录原信如下：康荫德君：
    你于九月三十日反映长途汽车客货混合装运易遭危险一事，经本院函华北公路总局设法改善。该局来函称，客货混合装载是由于目前各运输公司客车缺乏所致，现该局已根据实际情况，提出具体改善意见：（一）各公司现有轿式客车应专作客车使用，除旅客随身所带小件行李不妨碍其他旅客者外，不得装载其他货物；（二）利用卡车作客货混装，是为了减少空驶吨位，但装载旅客不能太多，应各有坐地，货物载量，应低于车槽，并不准旅客在驾驶室顶上乘坐，或将腿伸出车外，或攀把车旁；（三）装载整车货物时，其高宽长度均须按照客货运输规则办理，除押运人员外，不得附搭旅客；（四）关于商车管理问题，在未取得统一管理前，问题很多，除拟具实施办法呈请上级批示外，已饬各运输公司，分别研究改善，严加注意。
    华北人民监察院十月廿八日
