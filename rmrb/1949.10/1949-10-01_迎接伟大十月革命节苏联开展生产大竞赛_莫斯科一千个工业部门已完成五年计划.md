Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 29th: According to TASS, Moscow: To celebrate the upcoming 32nd anniversary of the Great October Revolution, a broad socialist emulation drive is underway in Soviet industry. The people of Moscow are competing to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule in terms of output and striving to fulfill the annual plan before November 7th. As of August 1st, approximately one thousand industrial departments in Moscow had completed their Five-Year Plan. Moscow's machine tool, machinery and precision instrument, electricity, and metallurgical industries have completed the Five-Year Plan in terms of total output and the most important items. The people of Moscow are using every means to fulfill their guarantee to Stalin—to complete the Five-Year Plan this year, one year ahead of the original date. The entire staff of enterprises in Leningrad is working to improve technology, such as utilizing modern equipment and the latest technological methods. In Riga, the capital of Soviet Latvia, more than 90% of the employees are participating in the socialist emulation. They are also working to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. More than eighty enterprises in Riga have achieved this goal. Workers in industrial centers such as Ukraine, Belarus, the Urals, Siberia, and Kazakhstan are working with all their strength. The entire staff of the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Plant is producing a considerable amount of metal beyond the plan to celebrate the anniversary of the Soviet state. The Stalin Oil Trust in Azerbaijan completed the nine-month plan ahead of schedule. The same is true for the three large-scale coal mining trusts in the Kuznetsk Coal Basin. The miners of the Burvo Maisky Coal Mining Trust in the Donets Coalfield are now producing 30% more coal than they produced last year. On September 21st, they completed the nine-month plan for coal mining and transportation. Twelve coal mines in Stalinino Oblast have completed the Five-Year Plan in terms of total output. Millions of participants in the socialist emulation have set themselves the goal of not only producing as much product this year as originally planned for 1950 (the final year of the Five-Year Plan) but also achieving all major indices in terms of applying new technologies, increasing labor productivity, improving quality, and reducing costs.

According to TASS, Bucharest: Personnel from many enterprises in Romania, including locomotive repair shops, electric motor factories, cement factories, etc., have launched an emulation drive to greet the October Revolution, aiming to complete this year's plan before November 7th.
