Fellow villagers, please listen. I'll tell you about Shanxi. It's surrounded by natural barriers. Taiyuan is at the center of Shanxi. It closely borders the Yellow River to the west. The Great Wall and Yanmen Pass are to the northwest. It reaches Datong Prefecture to the north. Pingxing Pass is to the northeast. There's the Zhengtai Railway to the east. And Niangziguan Pass in the middle. The Taihang Mountains and Zhongtiao Mountains. Mountain ranges connect in the southeast. The Mengjin River and Fen River Bay. Hanxin Ridge is in the south. The Tongpu Railway is in the southwest. Looking across the Yellow River towards Tongguan. Coal and iron are produced in the northwest mines. Luzhou in the southeast produces salt. I won't list all of Shanxi's products. There's a war criminal who can explain it all. Speaking of this person, his surname is Yan. His name is Xishan, courtesy name Baichuan. He lived in Wutai County, Shanxi. His family home was in Hebian Village. He wasn't a high-ranking official during the Qing Dynasty. He was in Taiyuan during the Xinhai Revolution. He was cunning and deceitful, good at pretending. He sided with whoever had power. He became the Grand Marshal in Beiping. After failing, he returned to Taiyuan. He served as a warlord for seventeen years. He sat as chairman for ten years. The people of Shanxi suffered terribly. Taxes and levies were increased again and again. The Tongpu Railway was built by him personally. The tracks aren't as wide as those on other railways. Ordnance factories and steel plants. Shanxi openly sold opium. Cigarette companies and spinning mills. Bureaucratic capital worth tens of millions. When the Japanese invaders entered the country, he didn't resist. He fled across the Yellow River to Yichuan. He sabotaged the anti-Japanese resistance of the Eighth Route Army. He colluded with the Japanese invaders. He joined the Japanese in opposing the Communists. After August 15th, he returned to Taiyuan. He openly committed acts of treason. He incorporated Japanese soldiers into his ranks. He assisted Chiang Kai-shek in opposing the Communists and fighting the civil war. He appointed Japanese commanders. He reached the height of lawlessness. He used poison gas several times. The Chinese Communist Party warned him. The war criminal must be caught and not be allowed to be lenient. Taiyuan was surrounded and liberated. In February, Old Yan left Taiyuan. The liberation army received orders. The commander was Xu Xiangqian. After three days and nights of outer defense battles. One hundred thousand enemies were annihilated. The bandit leader Wang Jingguo was captured. A Japanese prisoner of war named Yantian was captured alive. Taiyuan was liberated on the 24th. Nanjing was liberated on the 23rd. Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang was panicked. Some ran away, others staggered. Chickens flew and dogs jumped over the walls. Old Thief Yan fled to the ends of the earth. Soon the whole country was liberated. There was nowhere to hide, neither on earth nor in heaven. Old Yan was captured and put on trial. The people have the right to judge. The people want to vent this anger. Crush Yan Xishan's bones to dust.
