A Record of the Election of Employee Representatives at the Trolleybus Company
　　Niàn Gāo

The Beijing Trolleybus Company elected employee representatives in August. Because there was sufficient preparation before the election and the method of criticism and self-criticism was adopted during the election, the number of people participating in the election accounted for more than 85 percent of all employees. The elected representatives were all supported by the masses, and through this election, the employees also improved their political understanding.

Before the election work began, the trade union groups were first strengthened. Because the previous trade union groups were relatively lax, some groups had not held a meeting for more than three months, and some group leaders did not know the group members. Therefore, the trade union reorganized according to the principle of production unit and voluntary combination, combining two groups into one to discuss various issues related to the election of employee representatives. The trade union also issued the "Decision on Establishing Factory Management Committees and Employee Representative Conferences" from the North China Workers' Congress. At the joint meeting of group leaders, the significance and role of the Factory Management Committee and the Employee Representative Conference were explained, and the policy of adjusting the organization and personnel was explained to stabilize the employees' emotions. Each group also challenged each other to ensure that the meetings were fully attended and good representatives were elected.

The method of electing representatives was to first nominate candidates, with no limit to the number, and then discuss them in turn. During the discussion, the candidate first made a self-introduction and self-criticism, then the proposer made a supplementary introduction, then everyone criticized, and then the election was held. Cadres from the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and the factory trade union personally went to each group to provide specific guidance, explaining the powers and tasks of the representatives. Responsible cadres of the study class also explained in the class that the elected representatives should not only be able to handle affairs, but more importantly, be active in production and have correct thinking. During the discussion of the election, some people initially felt that it was enough to be able to handle affairs, and didn't care whether the thinking was correct or not. After discussion, everyone had a clearer understanding of the tasks of the representatives. The standards for representatives set by each group were mostly active in production, correct in thinking, upright in style, and clean in history. When discussing candidates, generally, they were carefully and repeatedly discussed several times. For example, when the road workers were electing, six candidates were nominated in Jia Zhonghao's group. During the discussion, everyone pointed out that Jia Zhonghao's shortcomings were his stubborn temper. He would talk to people when he was happy, but ignore everyone when he was unhappy. The advantage was that he was enthusiastic in helping people, cleaning up the house, and teaching people to read. He would be fine as long as he changed his temper. Jia accepted everyone's criticism very sincerely at the time, and hoped that everyone would criticize him at any time. At the same time, another candidate only made explanations and was not humble enough. Thus, the first discussion ended, and three people were selected from the six. The second time, after comparing the conditions of the three candidates, Jia Zhonghao was selected as a candidate. In another group, a candidate had participated in the "Anti-Communist Committee" and suppressed workers. During the discussion, the workers relentlessly exposed him, and as a result, he did not get a single vote.

When the staff members were electing, they generally had more concerns than the workers. Some were afraid of offending people, some wanted to elect those who were "nice" to them, some only elected section and department chiefs, and some units still had factionalism. As a result, during the discussion of candidates, there was more praise than criticism, and it was impossible to conduct a thorough election. After the leadership enlightened and guided them, and talked to everyone individually, everyone had a correct understanding of the election. With the leading role of the backbone members, they broke through the favors and truly launched criticism and self-criticism. Everyone compared the advantages and disadvantages of the candidates one by one. As a result, activists were discovered by the masses and the election was successful.

After the representatives were elected, the elected representatives chaired a meeting, and everyone put forward opinions, pointing out which advantages he should promote, which shortcomings he should correct, and how he should represent everyone to attend the meeting. This not only strengthened the connection between the representatives and the masses, but also deepened everyone's understanding of the Employee Representative Conference.

An important experience that this election tells us is: before the election, there must be sufficient preparation, and cadres must go deep into the groups to explain the powers, tasks, and conditions of the representatives, so that everyone realizes that they cannot only look at whether they can speak well, but more importantly, whether their thinking is correct, their character is upright, and they can correctly represent the interests of the workers. After such enlightenment, everyone gave full play to the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, nominated several candidates within the group, and seriously discussed and compared the conditions one by one. This enabled every employee to receive a vivid and profound democratic education, and greatly improved everyone politically. The unity within the group was also strengthened as a result. On this basis, those who are truly supported by everyone will naturally be elected.

During this election, the staff members of the accounting department realized that criticism and self-criticism is a powerful weapon to help progress, and suggested that those who are not candidates in the group should also be criticized. This shows the significance of this election for employee education.

　　记电车公司职工代表的选举
    念高
    北京电车公司在八月中选举职工代表，由于在选举前有充分的酝酿，在选举时采用了批评与自我批评的方法，所以参加选举的人数占全体职工的百分之八十五以上，选出的代表，都能为群众所拥护，而且通过这次选举，职工们在政治认识上也提高了一步。
    选举工作进行之前，首先是健全了工会小组。因为以前的工会小组比较松懈，有的组三个多月没开过一次会，有的组长不认识组员，所以工会就按生产单位及自愿组合的原则，两组合并一组，重新组织起来，以讨论各种有关选举职工代表的问题。并由工会印发华北工代会“关于建立工厂管理委员会与职工代表会议的决定”。在小组长联席会议上，解释工厂管理委员会和职工代表会的意义与作用，并对调整机构人事的方针加以说明，安定了职工情绪，各组并互相挑战应战，保证开会人齐，选出好代表。
    选举代表的方法，是先提候选人，名额不限，然后依次讨论。讨论时，先由候选人作自我介绍和检讨，再由提议人作补充介绍，再由大家批评，然后进行选举。市总工会与该厂职工会干部，并亲至各小组进行具体领导，说明代表的职权和任务；学习班的负责干部，也在班上说明，选出的代表，不但应该能办事，更主要的是要生产积极，思想正确。在讨论选举时，最初还有人觉得能办事就行了，甭管思想正确不正确。经过讨论后，大家对代表的任务已有较明确的认识，各组订的代表标准多是生产积极，思想正确，作风正派，历史清白。在讨论候选人时，一般的都是认真的反复讨论好几次。如车路工人选举时，在贾中浩小组里，提出了六名候选人。讨论时，大家指出贾中浩的缺点是脾气倔强，高兴时和人谈谈，不高兴就谁也不理。优点是热心帮助人，收拾屋子，教人认字。只要把脾气改改就好了。贾当时很诚恳地接受了大家的批评，并且希望大家随时批评。同时，另一候选人却尽做解释，不够虚心。这样，第一次讨论结束，从六人中选出了三个人；第二次，再经过大家比三个候选人的条件，选出贾中浩为候选人。另一个小组里，有个候选人参加过“清共委员会”，压迫过工人，在讨论时，工人就不留情的予以揭露，结果，未得一票。
    职员在选举时，一般的比工人顾虑多。有的怕得罪人，有的想选跟自己“不错”的，有的只选科、处长，有的单位还有派系门户之见。结果，在讨论候选人时，捧场多于批评，无法进行彻底的选举。经过领导上加以启发诱导，并与大家个别谈话，使大家对选举有了正确的认识，加以骨干分子带头，才打破了情面，真正展开了批评和自我批评，大家把候选人的优缺点一条一条的比较，结果，积极分子被群众发现，选举成功了。
    在代表选出后，再由当选各代表主持一次会议，由大家提意见，指出他应该发扬那些优点，纠正那些缺点，怎样代表大家去开会。这样，不只密切了代表与群众的联系，而且加深了大家对职工代表会的认识。
    这次选举告诉我们的一条重要经验是：选举前，必须进行充分的酝酿，由干部深入到小组中去，说明代表的职权、任务与条件，使大家认识到，不能光看是否能说会道，更重要的是思想正确，为人正派，能够正确的代表工人利益。经过这样的启发后，大家发挥了批评与自我批评的精神，在小组内提出几个候选人，一个一个认真的讨论，比条件，这样使每个职工都得到生动深刻的民主教育，使大家在政治上大大地提高了一步。小组内的团结也因此加强。在这个基础上，真正为大家所拥护的人，就自然被选出了。
    会计处的职员们在这次选举中，认识到批评与自我批评是帮助进步的有力武器，提议小组内不是候选人的人，也最好加以批评。由这件事可以看出这次选举对于职工教育的意义。
