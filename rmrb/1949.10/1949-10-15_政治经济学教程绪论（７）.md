  　The Object and Task of Political Economy Study and Its Characteristics
        Chapter One: Mode of Production
        Section One: Productive Forces
    Because if we simply calculate based on age, we cannot account for the strength of the worker's physique, the different nature of labor (or all kinds of work), the intensity of labor, the size of technical ability, and the level of technical proficiency, which would be a deviation towards egalitarianism. Because in terms of efficiency, some people are equal to one person, some are equal to one and a half or two people, and some are not equal to one person, only half a person or a quarter of a person. Of course, under normal circumstances, this situation can be calculated using a large number of observations to obtain a relatively average standard. Our division and stipulation of various labor forces should also take into account the general social average labor force in terms of both quantity and quality.
    In the industrial sector, the distinction of labor force has its own different standards. It should be examined and distinguished according to the nature of the industry, skilled labor or unskilled labor and the degree of skill, technical labor and non-technical labor and technical ability, labor intensity and other conditions.
    The degree of skill and technical mastery of labor determines the quality of the labor force.
    The degree of skill of labor, that is, whether labor is skilled or unskilled, has different effects on production efficiency. For example, in making nails, a skilled worker can make many in a day, while an unskilled worker makes fewer, and a beginner cannot make any. A skilled worker not only can make them, and make more, but also makes them well. Whether labor is skilled or not depends on the accumulation of years of labor experience, the worker's own efforts, and the learning of historical and traditional knowledge and experience (such as farmers learning from old farmers, and apprentices learning from masters). Skill refers to general events. If special techniques are required, it still depends on the ability to master the techniques and the degree of mastery. For example, if you do not understand the technology of driving a car, you will not be able to drive a car, and if the technology is not good, you will drive into a ditch, or hit people. Not only is driving a car like this, but other industries, handicrafts, and agriculture are also like this. The degree of skill varies depending on the length of time, a few months of learning is one thing, and a few years of learning is another. Machine workers have old workers who have worked for twenty or thirty years, and their labor skills are very skilled. Therefore, the labor force not only has quantitative differences, but also has qualitative differences. The skill level, technical level, intensity, etc. of labor determine the quality of the labor force. This includes the skill of labor, the methods and degree of mastering technology, experience, and efficiency. It also has a great influence and effect on the improvement and development of productive forces.
    Labor Intensity and the Improvement of Productivity
    The so-called labor intensity refers to the density of labor and the degree of tension of labor, that is, under the condition that technology and other conditions remain unchanged, only relying on workers to exert greater labor tension, spend more labor and more energy to expend greater labor volume, increase the density of labor, and produce more products in the same time, that is, to exert greater labor efficiency and obtain more production results.

　　政治经济学教程绪论（７）
    王学文
  　政治经济学的研究对象任务及其特点
        第一章　生产方式
        第一节　生产力
    因为如果单纯依据年龄标准来计算，则劳动者体力的强弱，不同性质的劳动（或各种各样的活）、劳动强度、技术能力的大小、技术熟练与否都不能计算在内，会犯平均主义的偏向。因为就效率来看，有一个人抵一个人的，有一个人抵一个半人或两个人的，也有一个人不抵一个人，只抵半个人或一个人的四分之一的。当然这种情况，在一般的情形下，依据大量观察的方法平均加以计算是可以获得相对的平均标准的。我们划分规定各种劳动力，也是应当照顾一般的社会平均劳动力量与质两方面的情况来定的。
    工业方面，劳动力的区别，自有不同的标准。它应当依据工业的性质、熟练劳动或非熟练劳动及熟练程度、技术劳动非技术劳动与技术能力、劳动强度等：条件来考察区别。
    劳动的熟练掌握技术的程度等，决定着劳动力的质
    劳动的熟练程度，即劳动熟练或不熟练，对于生产的效率不相同。例如造钉，熟练工人一天能造许多个，不熟练的就造的少，才学的也造不出来，而熟练的不只会造，造的多，而且又能造的好。劳动的熟练与否，是要依靠积年累月的劳动经验的积蓄，依靠劳动者自己的努力，与对历史上传统的知识经验的学习（如农民须向老农学习，学徒须向师傅学习）。熟练是指一般事件而言，如需要特别技术的，则还须视对技术的掌握能力，掌握程度而定。例如不懂开汽车技术的，就不会开汽车，如果技术不好会开到沟里去，会撞坏了人，会开的并且技术高的则就开的快，开的稳。不仅开汽车是这样，其他工业手工业以及农业，也都是这样。熟练的程度因年代的久暂而不同，学几个月的是一个样子，学几年的又是另一个样子。机器工人有工作了二三十年的老工人，他们的劳动技术就熟练得很了。所以劳动力，不但有其量的区别，而且还有质的区别，劳动的熟练技术水平及强度大小等等，决定着劳动力的质，在这里包含着劳动的熟练，掌握技术的方法，程度经验与效率等问题。它对于生产力的提高发展也是有很大影响与作用的。
    劳动强度与生产力的提高
    所谓劳动强度，是指劳动的密度，劳动的紧张程度而言，即在技术与其他条件不变的情况下，只依靠劳动者发挥更大的劳动紧张程度，耗费更多的劳动与更多的精力支出更大的劳动量，提高劳动的密度，在同一时间内生产更多的生产物来，即发挥更大的劳动能率，获得更多的生产效果。
