　　Shared Destiny and Invincible Cause
    Czechoslovak Newspapers Support the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations between Czechoslovakia and China
    【Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 7th】Czechoslovak newspapers have warmly endorsed the establishment of diplomatic relations between Czechoslovakia and China. Rudé Právo, the organ of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, published an editorial on the 5th entitled "An Important Decision," stating: "The camp to which Czechoslovakia belongs has been strengthened by China's victory and the participation of hundreds of millions of people; our government's recognition of the Chinese government is an expression of a shared destiny and an invincible cause, for which we are fighting alongside the Soviet Union. At this moment of recognizing the People's Republic of China, we extend our congratulations to the great Chinese nation, its government, the renowned and heroic Chinese Communist Party, and its leader Mao Zedong." "The epoch-making victory of the Chinese working people over foreign imperialists and the reactionary Fifth Column represented by the Kuomintang regime, and the establishment of the People's Republic of China represented by the Central People's Government in Beijing, is a great event that must be fully valued. It has greatly strengthened the world's peace camp, and at the same time, is a new blow to the entire capitalist and imperialist system."
    Lidové Noviny, the organ of the Czechoslovak Writers' Association (whose editor-in-chief is the famous writer Durda), stated in its editorial on the 5th: "The Czechoslovak government, which from today begins to establish diplomatic relations with the new and great People's Republic of China, demonstrates that it maintains a policy of forging alliances that strengthen peace and the independence of all nations. The Czechoslovak people congratulate the Chinese people, because their victory has decisively changed the balance of power in favor of the camp of peace and progress." The newspaper's editorial, after quoting Chairman Mao Zedong's words "Our work will be written in human history," and recalling the events that occurred in China from the Opium War until the founding of the new People's Republic, wrote: "This historically significant victory was achieved due to the great efforts of the Communist Party in faithfully adhering to the principles of Marxism-Leninism, and it was achieved due to the great efforts of the Chinese people. It was achieved because the Chinese people, in addition to using their own experience, also used the experience of the Soviet people. It was achieved because the progressive camp is stronger than the reactionary and war camp."

　　休戚相关和不可征服的事业
    捷克各报拥护捷中建立邦交
    【新华社布拉格七日电】捷克斯洛伐克各报纸均热烈拥护捷中建立外交关系。捷共机关报红色权力报五日发表题为“重要的决定”的社论说：“捷克斯洛伐克所参加的阵营，已因中国的胜利和数万万人民的参加而加强了；我国政府的承认中国政府，是休戚相关和不可征服的事业的一种表示，我们也正为着这一事业而与苏联并肩奋斗。值此承认中国人民政府的时刻，我们谨向伟大的中华民族、它的政府、著名的英勇的中国共产党及其领袖毛泽东庆贺。”“中国劳动人民对外国帝国主义者及国民党政权所代表的反动的第五纵队的划时代的胜利，北京中央政府所代表的中国人民共和国的成立，是一个必须充分重视的伟大事件。它大大地加强了全世界的和平阵营，同时，是对整个资本主义与帝国主义制度的一个新的打击。”
    捷作家协会机关报里都维·诺温尼（其主编为著名作家德尔达）五日的社论说：“自今日开始与新的巨大的中华人民共和国建立外交关系的捷克斯洛伐克政府，表明它保持着一种政策，就是缔结加强和平与各民族独立的联盟。捷克斯洛伐克人祝贺中国人民，因为他们的胜利确定地改变了力量的对比，而使之有利于和平与进步的阵营。”该报社论在援引毛泽东主席的话“我们的工作将写在人类的历史上”，及回溯自鸦片战争直到新的人民共和国成立的时日里在中国所发生的事件之后，写道：“这个历史意义的胜利之所以获得，是由于忠实遵守马克思、列宁主义原则的共产党的巨大努力，它之所以获得，是由于中国人民的巨大努力。它之所以获得，是因为中国人民除运用他们自己的经验外，还运用了苏联人民的经验。它之所以获得，是因为进步阵营较反动与战争阵营更为强大。”
