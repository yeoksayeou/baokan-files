　　Pursue Chiang Kai-shek for Blood Debts
　　You Zhen
　　On September 2nd, Mr. Guo Moruo called upon "Sichuan people, rise up" in the People's Daily to capture Chiang Kai-shek alive and hand him over to the people for public trial. This is the latest task for all Chinese people today. Therefore, I want to present my accusations against Chiang Kai-shek.
　　In 1929, in a small town in my hometown of Southern Fujian, I lost a most respectable teacher. He was from Longyan, named Chen Junchang. He had enlightened my wisdom. He was thrown into Xiamen City Prison for participating in revolutionary activities and was dismembered and displayed as a warning after escaping from prison. In Meiling Village, at the junction of Jinjiang and Nan'an, the Chiang bandits even created a human tragedy of fathers, sons, brothers, and uncles hacking each other to death. In Yong'an and Liancheng in Western Fujian, I discovered "five hundred person pits" and "thousand person pits." This is a blood debt!
　　From 1932 to 1940, in the Southern Fujian area, I saw several "hundred person pits." In Quanzhou, countless corpses were dragged out from a corner of the Chiang bandit headquarters' drill ground all year round. At that time, teachers in the countryside and public employees in the cities who did not join the Kuomintang would be dismissed or laid off without cause. In 1940, there were as many as thirteen systems of secret service agencies in Quanzhou City alone. In the past eight years, it is estimated that no less than 80,000 educated youths in Fujian have been massacred. This is a blood debt!
　　In the winter of 1942, in Guiyang, I personally witnessed a female student from Anhui being shot dead by a secret agent at the school gate. The murderer was arrested on the spot but was released after being submitted to the Security Command. For publishing a "tragedy" news item on the wall newspaper, the school authorities forced the publication to be discontinued, canceled my living allowance, then recorded two major demerits, and then several plainclothes men with guns on Zhonghua Road dragged me into the "Yunnan Guild Hall" concentration camp. Inside, I found many male and female students who had been missing for more than a year. One day, while clearing out the inventory of sundries, I found many car parts in damp and rotten trunks, and hundreds of passports and photos of overseas Chinese returning to the country. I couldn't help but shed tears for these relics. These hundreds of patriotic sons and daughters who returned to the motherland to participate in the War of Resistance ended their lives here silently, murdered by the Chiang bandits. How could their relatives know of their fate! This is a blood debt!
　　In the autumn of 1946, I was imprisoned in a concentration camp in Xi'an for as long as twenty months. There was a 27-year-old Tibetan youth named Wan Lihai who had been living there for nine years. The eighth squadron died ninety-five members in three months. Patients had an average of four taels of lice on their bodies. Outside twenty li to the south of Xi'an, new graves were piled up, and wild dogs could often be seen gnawing on fresh, bloody corpses in the wheat fields, and flocks of crows in the air held intestines several feet long. On New Year's Day evening in 1947, six female warriors with bare legs and arms were hung on trees at Sanmenkou in the southern suburbs of Xi'an for an hour. They were subjected to this humiliation because they refused to toast and sing for the beasts in the concentration camp! Some were kicked and beaten by the secret agents and vomited blood, and some even suffered the tragedy of miscarriage.
　　I want to present these blood debts before all Chinese compatriots and pursue Chiang Kai-shek, this bloodthirsty beast, for blood debts. Today, the task of "capturing Chiang Kai-shek alive and handing him over to the people for public trial" has been put forward by Mr. Guo's loud voice. People of the whole country, it is time to demand repayment of blood debts.

### 向蒋介石追回血债

　　向蒋介石追回血债
    友  珍
    九月二日，郭沫若先生在人民日报上号召“四川人，起来”活捉蒋介石，交给人民公审，这是全中国人民今天最新的课题，因此我要提出对蒋介石的控诉。
    一九二九年，在故乡闽南一小镇上，我丧失了一位极可敬爱的教师，他是龙岩人，名叫陈俊昌，他曾经启蒙过我的智慧，他因了参加革命活动，被投入厦门市监狱，后因越狱而被分尸示众。在晋江、南安交界的梅岭村上，蒋匪竟制造了父子、兄弟、伯叔互相砍杀的人间惨剧，在闽西永安、连城一带，我发现了“五百人坑”，“千人坑”，这是血债！
    一九三二年到四○年间，在闽南一带，我看见“百人坑”数起。在泉州，蒋匪司令部操场的一角，终年拖出数不尽的尸首。那时候在乡下教书的，在城市里当公教人员的不参加国民党的，是会无故的被解聘或裁撤的。一九四○年，单就泉州城里的特务机关就有十三个系统，最近八年间，福建知识青年被屠杀的据估计不下八万人之多，这是血债！
    一九四二年冬，在贵阳，我亲眼看到一位皖籍的女同学在校门口被特务枪杀，凶手当场被捕后被提交保安司令部开释。为了在壁报上登上一篇“惨案”的消息，学校当局强迫停刊并取消了我的生活贷金，然后记两个大过，接着在中华路上几个持枪的便衣，把我架进“云南会馆”集中营去，在里面，我发现许多失踪一年多的男女同学。有一天在清理库存的杂物时，我发现阴湿腐烂的衣箱里，有许多汽车零件，有数百张归国华侨的护照与像片，我对这遗物不禁黯然流泪，这几百满腔热血回到祖国来参加抗战的祖国儿女们竟无声无息地在这儿抱恨终天，被蒋匪暗害了，他们的亲人那能晓得他们的遭遇！这是血债！
    一九四六年秋，我被囚在西安集中营中达二十个月之久，里面有位二十七岁的西藏青年名叫万里浪，已经住上九个年头了。第八中队在三个月中死亡了九十五位队员。病号平均每人身上有四两虱子。西安南郊二十里内外，新冢垒垒，经常可以看到野狗在麦地上啃着鲜血淋漓的尸体，空中的乌鸦群衔着几尺长的肠胃。一九四七年元旦的黄昏，西安南郊三门口树上吊绑着六位光着腿臂的女战士达一小时之久，她们因不肯为集中营的野兽们敬酒与唱歌，而遭此凌辱！有的被特务们踢打而吐血，甚至有的演着小产的惨剧。
    这些血债，我要在全中国同胞前提出，向蒋介石这位嗜血的野兽追回血债。今天“活捉蒋介石，交付人民公审”这课题是被郭先生宏亮的声音提出来了。全国人民，追讨血债，是时候了。
