　　Summary of Afforestation in Sandy Wasteland of Western Hebei During the 1949 Rainy Season
　　Western Hebei Sandy Wasteland Afforestation Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture
　　　　I. Establishing 23,000 Mu of Protective Forest Belts
　　From mid-July to early August 1949, seven counties along the Pinghan Railway in western Hebei, including Quyang, Xingtang, Zhengding, Dingxian, Xinle, Wuji, and Gaocheng, launched a large-scale rainy season afforestation campaign. They completed planting over 1,629,000 wind and sandbreak trees, over 932,000 flood control trees, and over 986,000 other trees and fruit trees, totaling over 3,548,227 trees. This exceeded the original plan (1,720,000 trees) by more than double and surpassed the achievements of the spring afforestation of 2,500,000 trees. A total of 108,800 farmers participated in cooperative or collective afforestation, completing over 23,680 mu of forest belts with poplar, willow, *du* trees, wild jujube, and jujube trees. A fervent afforestation competition swept through the sandy wasteland areas of various counties. Quyang County reached its peak; through the core leadership of the county party committee and thorough deliberation in meetings at all levels, a "Shock Afforestation Week" was held at the end of July. All cadres devoted themselves to this unprecedented movement, deeply organizing the masses and achieving a brilliant result of completing 238 percent of the original plan, with over 1,388,000 trees planted. Xingtang County also completed over 997,000 trees, equivalent to 181 percent of the original plan. Other counties also completed their plans ahead of schedule and exceeded the quotas. Spot checks were conducted on key village afforestation, which accounted for a large proportion of the total. Over 80 percent of the early-planted poplar and willow trees have sprouted and taken root. These achievements greatly boosted people's confidence in rainy season afforestation, reversed backward thinking, such as "trees planted in hot weather cannot survive; the masses are not used to it and cannot be mobilized!" and laid a solid foundation for the future three-season-a-year afforestation movement, providing important inspiration for the current autumn afforestation.
　　　　II. Thorough Implementation of Policies and In-Depth Leadership Are Factors for Success
　　The Western Hebei Sandy Wasteland Afforestation Bureau convened a rainy season afforestation conference on July 8th. More than 70 people attended, including forestry cadres from seven counties (Dingxian, Xinle, Wuji, Gaocheng, Quyang, Xingtang, Zhengding), the Fourth and Ninth Prefectural Administrations, and the Hebei Administrative Office, as well as forestry personnel from the North China Ministry of Agriculture, the Agricultural Science Research Institute, the Beijing Research Institute, the Hebei Agricultural College, and the Baoding Agricultural Vocational School, and local afforestation model workers. They gathered together to study techniques, exchange experiences, and fully recognize the favorable conditions of rainy season afforestation and the importance of seizing the opportunity to prevent disasters. They also resolved various specific issues related to afforestation and forest protection. The spring afforestation was evaluated and awards were given, stimulating competition among the counties. Each county formulated an afforestation plan, focusing on dry sandy wasteland and riverine areas to establish large-scale windbreak, sandbreak, and flood control forest belts.
　　Subsequently, each county and key area successively convened joint village afforestation conferences to expand afforestation propaganda, use afforestation heroes and models to lead villages without the habit of rainy season afforestation, emphasize strengthening forest protection work, break down ideological concerns, commend good examples, and universally launch challenge competitions between villages and groups.
　　After the Western Hebei rainy season afforestation conference, the Afforestation Bureau, together with 70 forestry personnel from various participating units in Beijing and Baoding, organized a work team to participate in the afforestation of various counties. Combined with county and district cadres, they went deep into key villages to carry out propaganda and organizational work, using villages with better conditions as the center to drive a whole area. Comrades participating in the leadership personally got their hands dirty, helping the masses with planning and organization, mastering technology, and planting trees with the masses, which received enthusiastic support.
　　In order to strengthen technical leadership, in addition to over 50 forestry technicians from Beijing, Baoding, and the Afforestation Bureau who went deep into key districts and villages to master afforestation techniques, Xingtang County also transferred 20 local afforestation experts from their production positions and organized a work team to mobilize the masses and master techniques in various places, striving for dense planting, deep burial, tight compaction, and minimal exposure in sandy wasteland afforestation.
　　Most villages in the Fifth District of Wuji County lacked the habit of rainy season afforestation. The work team convened a joint village afforestation conference to study techniques. After introducing the successful experiences of rainy season afforestation in other villages, Village Chief Zhao Zhengsi said: "If other places can make it work, we can definitely do it here too. We must mobilize the masses when we get back." In this way, concrete facts were used at various meetings to break down the backward ideas that "trees planted in hot weather cannot survive" and "the masses are not used to it and cannot be mobilized," explaining the favorable conditions for rainy season afforestation, boosting confidence, and enabling the movement to be carried out quickly.
　　Beiniu Village in Wuji and Jiangu Village in Gaocheng both promoted the "bow-shaped layering method" through old farmers with prestige in the village. Gujun Village in Xingtang organized cooperative afforestation through activists such as Zhao Lojiu, accepted scientific and technological techniques, and systematically used poplar to create a mesh-like protective forest belt on a piece of more than 300 mu of sandy wasteland. *Duli* pears were planted in the gaps between the forest belts to develop orchards.
　　　　III. Advocating Cooperative Afforestation and Collective Afforestation
　　In the afforestation movement, we paid special attention to cooperative collective afforestation. In the past, villages in sandy wasteland and riverine areas of various counties often had the habit of collectively building "village-owned forests" to create larger forests and defend against wind, sand, and floods, but some organizations were not sound enough. In the past, afforestation often resulted in low survival rates and poor protection. This summer, the work team strengthened the organization of small groups and the leadership of the entire village in key villages on the original basis. For example, Jiangu Village in Gaocheng was divided into three sections by street, with five cadres in charge of organizing the work in each section. The labor force participating in tree planting was organized into groups for cutting seedlings, transporting seedlings, digging pits, planting trees, and providing technical guidance. 406 people were mobilized to complete over 12,300 trees in one day, planting them quickly and well.
　　In order to closely link collective afforestation with private interests, key districts promoted cooperative afforestation. Based on the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit, the masses were organized to contribute labor, seedlings, and land as shares, sign contracts, share dividends according to the shares, jointly solve the difficulties in afforestation and forest protection, and create larger and more effective windbreak forest belts. For example, Qin Village in Xingtang established an afforestation committee to organize cooperative afforestation by 135 people in the entire village. Everyone was in high spirits, planting deeply and compacting firmly. In a three-day blitz, three windbreak forest belts were completed, and over 7,000 willow cuttings were planted, stipulating that the proceeds would be shared according to the shares of people, land, and seedlings. Under the mobilization and organization of cadres and party members in Donghuotong Village, more than 120 people voluntarily participated in cooperative afforestation, absorbing over 35,000 catties of seedling shares, with 100 catties of seedlings and three workdays as one share. In a three-day blitz, over 12,000 trees were completed, driving the planting of over 3,000 trees through small-scale cooperative afforestation. For example, on the south bank of the Shahe River in Xinle County, joint village afforestation was organized by three villages. Xiwulou Village provided seedlings and mobilized over 450 people to use the private wasteland of Muyunpu and Sanhepu to build over 23,000 flood control trees, eliminating over 400 mu of sandy wasteland. A contract was signed, with tree shares and land shares equally divided, and a joint village forest protection agreement was established for joint protection.
　　Other counties also saw the emergence of many good examples of cooperative afforestation or collective afforestation. In total, the seven counties mobilized over 108,800 people to participate in this type of more organized afforestation. The number of "village-owned forests" and "cooperative forests" completed by Wuji, Xinle, and Gaocheng counties accounted for 72 percent of the total number of trees planted this summer, and this generally drove private afforestation.
　　Attention was also paid to forest protection during afforestation. The counties in the area began to pay attention to forest protection issues from the spring afforestation. Xinle County formulated interim forest protection measures at the spring production expansion meeting, instructing each village to use this as a basis to specifically discuss and agree on the forest protection conventions of each village. After being filed with the county by the district, they were earnestly implemented. By the time rainy season afforestation began, 78 villages in the county had established conventions that had been approved by the county. Including the old conventions, 80 percent of the villages in the county had established conventions, and the phenomenon of arbitrarily destroying trees had rarely occurred. The Xingtang County government also issued announcements to various villages, strengthening forest protection work. Half of the villages in the county had signed conventions and filed them with the district. Recently, the timely handling of those who destroyed trees in the third and fifth districts further dispelled the ideological concerns of the masses and increased the enthusiasm for afforestation.
　　　　IV. Solving the Seedling Difficulties
　　Over 90 percent of the rainy season afforestation in various places used small-leaved poplar and willow cuttings, in addition to transplanting wild seedlings such as wild jujube, *du* trees, jujube, and elm. Apart from villages with more publicly owned poplar and willow trees using public seedlings to collectively build village-owned forests, for villages and households with seedling difficulties, most of them mobilized the masses to participate in cooperative afforestation, absorbing seedling shares. For example, the Xingtang Donghuotong Village Afforestation Cooperative absorbed 35,000 catties of seedling shares, and the Xinle Xiwulou Village participated in the three-village joint afforestation with seedlings needed for 23,000 cuttings, which are all good examples. The village chief of Nanzijing Village in Dingxian voluntarily lent out over 500 catties of seedlings to five households lacking seedlings, driving the entire village to borrow seedlings from each other, solving the seedling problem and completing four windbreak forest belts with a total of 12,000 trees. Zhongzuo Village in Quyang purchased jujube seedlings from Xinle; Chengxi Township exchanged firewood for two carts of seedlings; Zhao Luofeng, a model tree planter in Zhengding Guanjiaopu, voluntarily supplied seedlings to the village and borrowed seven carts of seedlings from Xibaizhuang to complete more than 20 windbreak forest belts in order to drive the entire village to plant trees and block wind and sand. Other areas also helped the masses solve seedling difficulties in many ways, completing the afforestation plan.
　　　　V. Deviations in the Movement and Matters Requiring Attention in the Future
　　(1) Some cadres neglected afforestation work. Individual county and district leaders in Gaocheng, Dingxian, Xinle, and Zhengding counties did not have a sufficient understanding of the favorable conditions for rainy season afforestation and the importance of leading the masses to plant trees. Some emphasized that the masses were not used to it and could not be led, while others believed that tree planting did not require leadership and did not integrate well with the work team, causing great losses to the work. After reviewing, everyone believed that the Afforestation Bureau should strengthen forestry propaganda and education work in the future, compile various propaganda materials, hold physical object and picture exhibitions, strengthen communication and reporting, and instill forestry knowledge into leaders at all levels, arousing everyone's attention and interest in afforestation work.
　　(2) Not enough technical work was done to improve things. In most areas, the forest belts were planted too sparsely, the branches were exposed too long, and too many branches were placed in each pit. The middle branches could not stick to the soil, causing them to dry out and die from ventilation. In addition, in individual places, very thick poplar and willow poles were planted, exposing three or four *chi*, making it difficult to survive. At the same time, except for the key villages that mastered it better, most of them failed to create a mesh-like forest belt according to scientific principles, so the windbreak, sandbreak, and flood control effects were not great.
　　In order to universally improve afforestation technology and systematically and step-by-step establish forest belts, develop fruit trees and pasture, the Afforestation Bureau decided to set up short-term training courses after autumn to train relevant professional cadres from each county and district and industrial assistants from key afforestation areas. Forestry knowledge will also be implemented in agricultural training courses in various places, or circulating training courses will be conducted to absorb young activists from various places for short-term training. Each seasonal afforestation conference must be combined with training cadres, and then professional cadres from the county and district will convene old farmer forums to exchange experiences and introduce new technologies.
　　(3) Insufficient attention was paid to disputes over land rights in sandy wasteland in leadership. Due to the increased enthusiasm for afforestation, the masses of each village greatly strengthened their desire to occupy sandy wasteland. Long-standing land boundary disputes have broken out again. For example, most of the land rights in the Lao Cihe sandy wasteland are unclear, and there are almost land boundary disputes between villages, constantly causing friction in the mobilization of afforestation, hindering the development of work. If this problem is not resolved in time, autumn afforestation cannot be carried out. The leadership of each county should attach importance to this issue left over from the land reform and resolve it in a timely manner. The wasteland with unclear land rights involving more than two counties should be investigated by the prefectural commissioner's office or the provincial government in conjunction with the Afforestation Bureau, and a thorough treatment plan should be decided through the People's Congress, so as to systematically develop cooperative afforestation.
　　(4) General neglect of mobilizing women's work. Except for Xingtang County, which mobilized more women to participate in afforestation, only individual villages in other counties did a better job. Generally, this work was neglected, or there were only calls without specific organizational work, and they were not mobilized. This should be paid attention to in the future.
　　(5) Insufficient attention was paid to nursery work. It is very easy to survive by sowing tree seeds such as *Zisuìhuái* during the rainy season, but Quyang and other counties have these tree seeds but have not distributed them to the masses for sowing in time, which has damaged the seedling work. At the same time, the public nursery plans of each county failed to complete on time this spring due to insufficient preparation. In order to ensure completion next spring, each county must make preliminary plans before the end of August so that the Afforestation Bureau can provide financial and technical assistance and prepare seeds and land in time.
　　(6) Failure to integrate well with river management work. Afforestation along the river should be closely integrated with the water conservancy department to create effective flood control forest belts according to the river management plan. However, the counties did not pay enough attention to this point. For example, when villages along the Mukudao Ditch in Wuji mobilized the masses to repair embankments, they could have attached willow branches to the sides of the embankments to consolidate them, but they did not do so in practice. At the same time, some of the forest belts built by some villages along the Shahe River blocked the river channel and were washed away in part or in large part within a few days after planting, which was the result of not being well integrated with river management work. In the future, afforestation along the river should be under the unified leadership of the river management department and carried out in a planned manner.
　　(7) No method for distributing income from collective afforestation has been determined. In order to complete the task as soon as possible, some villages gathered the masses to plant trees without sufficient deliberation or agreeing on a method for distributing income. As a result, the masses thought that they were planting for the public and did not care much. Some villages have taken a step forward and organized the masses to participate in cooperative afforestation based on the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit. However, detailed accounts were not kept at that time, and no contracts were written, so there is a possibility of disputes after the trees grow up. Each county should assist each village in clearing procedures with an attitude of responsibility to the masses.

　　一九四九年雨季
    冀西沙荒造林总结
    农业部冀西沙荒造林局
        一、建立防护林带二万三千亩
    冀西平汉沿线沙荒较多的曲阳、行唐、正定、定县、新乐、无极、藁城等七县，自七月中旬发动大规模雨季造林运动，至八月初旬，完成防风防沙林一百六十二万九千余株，防洪林九十三万二千余株，其他造林与栽植果树九十八万六千余株，共计三百五十四万八千二百二十七株，超出原计划（一百七十二万株）一倍以上，并超过了今春造林二百五十万株的成绩。参加合作或集体造林的农民，共达十万八千八百余人，完成小叶杨、柳树、杜树、酸枣、枣等林带二万三千六百八十余亩。各县沙荒地区，普遍掀起热烈的造林竞赛，其中曲阳县更达高峰，该县通过党委的核心领导，经各级会议充分酝酿，于七月底举行造林突击周，全体干部投入这一规模空前的运动中，深入组织群众，获得了完成原计划百分之二百三十八的光辉成绩，全县造林一百三十八万八千余株。行唐县亦完成九十九万七千余株，相当原计划百分之一百八十一。其他各县均按期超数完成计划。占较大数字的重点村造林，大部均进行检查，种植较早的杨柳林，百分之八十以上已发芽生根。这一成绩的获得，大大提高了人们的雨季造林信心，扭转了“伏天栽树活不了；群众没有习惯，发动不起来！”的落后思想，给今后的一年三季造林运动建立了巩固的基础，对目前秋季造林有着重要的启示。
    　　　　二、贯彻政策深入领导是成功的因素
    冀西沙荒造林局于七月八日召开了雨季造林会议，参加的有：定县、新乐、无极、藁城、曲阳、行唐、正定等七县，四、九两专署及冀中行署的林业干部，与华北农业部、农业科学研究所、北京研究院、河北农学院、保定农职等单位的林业人员，及当地造林的英模共七十多人济济一堂，互相研究技术，交流经验，使大家充分认识雨季造林的有利条件及抓紧雨季造林防灾的重要性，并解决有关造林护林的各项具体问题。并对春季造林进行评议发奖，引起各县的竞赛，由各县制订造林计划，以干燥沙荒及沿河地区为重点，大量建立防风、防沙、防洪林带。
    随后各县及重点区，均先后召开联村造林会议，扩大造林宣传，通过造林英雄模范，带动没有雨季造林习惯的村子，并强调加强护林工作，打破思想顾虑，表扬良好典型，普遍的展开了村与村、团体与团体的挑战竞赛。
    冀西雨季造林会议结束后，造林局会同到会各单位林业人员共七十人，组织工作组，分头参加各县造林，结合县区干部，深入各重点村做宣传组织工作，以条件较好的村为中心，带动一片。参加领导的同志，都能亲自下手，帮助群众计划与组织，掌握技术，跟群众一起栽树，得到了热烈的拥护。
    为加强技术领导，除了从北京保定各单位来的与造林局的林业技术人员共五十余人，深入各重点区村掌握造林技术外，行唐县并抽调本县造林能手二十人，临时脱离生产，组织工作组，赴各地发动群众，掌握技术，力求沙荒造林要密植、深埋、紧砸和少露。
    无极县五区多数村子，本来缺乏雨季造林习惯，工作组即召开联村造林会议，研究技术，介绍了外村雨季造林的成功经验以后，赵正寺村长便说：“别处能栽活，咱这地方准也行，回去一定发动群众。”这样在各种会议上，用具体事实打破了“伏天栽树不活”、“群众没习惯发动不起来”的落后思想，说明雨季造林的有利条件，提高信心，使运动能够迅速开展。
    无极北牛村、藁城坚固村，都通过村中有威信的老农，推广了“弓形压条法”，行唐故郡村并通过赵洛九等积极分子，组织合作造林，接受科学技术，在三百多亩的一块沙荒上，有计划的用小叶杨造成网状防护林带，并于林带间隔中栽植杜梨，发展果园。
    　　　　三、提倡合作造林、集体造林
    在造林运动中，我们特别注意合作集体造林。过去各县沙荒与沿河地区村庄，为了造成较大的树林，防御风沙洪水，大部有集体造“村有林”的习惯，但有的组织不够健全，过去造林往往成活少，保护差，今夏工作组在各重点村，于原有的基础上，加强了小组的组织与全村的领导，如藁城坚固村是按街分成三片，每片由五个干部负责进行组织工作，把参加栽树的劳力编成砍树秧、运树秧、刨坑、栽树及技术督导等小组，发动四百零六人，一天完成一万二千三百余株，栽得又快又好。
    为了把集体造林与私人利益密切的结合起来，各重点区提倡了合作造林，根据自愿两利原则，组织群众，以人工、树秧、土地等入股，订立合同，按股分红，共同解决造林护林上的困难，并造成较大的有效的防风林带。如行唐秦村成立造林委员会，组织全村一百三十五人的合作造林，全体情绪很高，栽得又深，砸得又实，突击三天，完成防风林三道，压杨柳条七千余穴，订明有了收益按人、地、树秧股分红。该县东霍同村在干部党员的动员组织下，一百二十余人自愿入股参加合作造林，共吸收树秧股三万五千余斤，以一百斤树秧三个工为一股，突击三天，完成一万二千余株，并带动小型合作造林三千余株。又如新乐县沙河南岸，组织了三个村的联村造林，由西五楼村出树秧，发动群众四百五十余人，利用木运铺和三合铺的私荒造防洪林二万三千余株，消灭沙荒四百余亩，订立合同，树股与地股对半分红，又建立联村护林公约共同保护。
    其他各县也涌现了不少良好的合作造林或集体造林的典型，总计七县共发动十万八千八百余人参加这一类较有组织的造林，无极、新乐、藁城三县完成的“村有林”与“合作林”株数，占今夏造林总数百分之七十二，并由此普遍的带动了私人造林。
    在造林中并注意了护林。该区各县从春季造林便开始注意护林问题，新乐县于春季扩大生产会议上曾制订暂行护林办法，指示各村以此为依据，具体议定各村护林公约，由区转县备案后认真执行。至雨季造林开始，全县已有七十八个村庄订立公约，经县批准，加上旧有公约的，全县已有百分之八十的村庄建立公约，随意破坏林木的现象已很少发生。行唐县府亦曾布告各村，加强护林工作，全县二分之一的村庄，已订立公约，经区备案。最近三、五等区，对破坏林木者的及时处理，更大大的解除群众的思想顾虑，提高造林的积极性。
    　　　　四、解决树秧困难
    各地雨季造林九成以上是用小叶杨和柳枝压条，此外便是移栽酸枣、杜树、枣、榆等野生苗，除了公有杨柳树较多的村，一般的利用公有秧子集体造村有林外，对树秧困难的村与户，多半是发动群众合作造林，吸收树秧入股，如行唐东霍同村造林合作社，吸收三万五千斤树秧入股，及新乐西五楼村以压条二万三千穴所需树秧入股参加三村联村造林，都是很好的例子。定县南子京村长自愿借出树秧五百多斤，给缺乏树秧的五户，带动全村互借树秧，解决树秧问题，完成防风林四道，共一万二千株。曲阳中左村至新乐采购枣苗；城西乡用柴火换树秧两车；正定拐角铺植树模范赵洛峰为了带动全村造林阻挡风沙，自动的供给村里树秧，并从西白庄借用树秧七车，完成二十多道防风林。其他地区亦是这样帮助群众从多方面解决树秧困难，完成造林计划。
    　　　　五、运动中的偏向与今后应注意的事项
    （一）部分干部忽视了造林工作。藁城、定县、新乐、正定等县个别县区领导干部，因对雨季造林的有利条件及领导群众造林的重要性认识不足，有的强调群众没有习惯，领导不起来，有的认为栽树不用领导，没有与工作组很好的结合起来，使工作受到很大的损失。经检讨以后，大家认为造林局今后应加强林业宣传教育工作，编制各种宣传品，举办实物图片展览，加强通讯报导，向各级领导干部贯输林业常识，引起大家对造林工作的重视与兴趣。
    （二）提高技术工作做的不够。大部分地区的林带栽的太稀，枝梢露的太长，每穴条子放得太多，当中的条子贴不上土，以至透风干死，还有个别地方，竟栽很粗的杨柳杆子，露出三四尺，不易成活。同时除了掌握较好的重点村外，一般都未能根据科学原理，有计划的造成网状林带，以至防风沙与防洪效力不大。
    为了普遍的提高造林技术，有计划、有步骤的建立林带，发展果树、牧草，造林局决定于秋后设短期训练班，调训有关各县区专业干部与造林重点区之实业助理员，并于各地农业训练班中，附带贯彻林业常识，或办理巡回训练班，吸收各地青年积极分子，加以短期训练。每季造林会议并须与训练干部结合，再通过县区专业干部，分头召开老农座谈会，交流经验，介绍新技术。
    （三）领导上对于沙荒地权地界纠纷的注意不足。由于造林积极性的提高，各村群众对沙荒地的占有欲大大加强，平静已久的地界纠纷，又纷纷发生，如老磁河沙荒大部地权不明，村与村间几乎都有地界纠纷，在发动造林中不断引起磨擦，妨碍了工作开展，这一问题如不及时解决，秋季造林即无法开展。对于这一个土改遗留问题，各县领导上应加重视，及时给以解决，有关两县以上的地权不明荒地，应由专署或省府派人会同造林局进行调查，通过人民代表会，决定彻底处理办法，以便有计划的发展合作造林。
    （四）一般忽视发动妇女工作。除行唐县发动妇女参加造林较多外，其他各县只有个别村子，做得较好，一般的都忽视了这一工作，或仅有号召而缺乏具体组织工作，没有发动起来，这在今后应很好注意。
    （五）苗圃工作重视不足。利用雨季播种紫穗槐等树籽，本来极易成活，但曲阳等县虽存有这种树籽，都未及时发给群众播种，使育苗工作受到损失。同时各县公营苗圃计划，今春因准备不足，未能按时完成。为了保证明春完成，各县须于八月底以前，作出初步计划，以便由造林局给予经费及技术上的协助，及时准备种籽与土地。
    （六）与治河工作没结合好。沿河造林本应与水利部门密切结合，根据治河计划，造成有效的防洪林带。但各县对这一点的注意都不够，如无极木刀沟沿河各村，发动群众修堤时，本可附带捎上杨柳条，压在堤侧，巩固堤防，但实际没有这样做。同时沙河沿岸部分村子所造林带，妨碍河道，栽后不到几天即被冲去一部或大部，这都是没有与治河工作结合好的结果。今后沿河造林应受治河部门统一领导，有计划的进行。
    （七）集体造林没有确定收益分配办法。有的村子为了争先完成任务，未经充分酝酿，商定收益分配办法，便集合群众造林，结果群众认为是给公家栽，很不关心。有的村子虽已提高一步，根据自愿两利原则，组织群众入股，合作造林。但当时没有详细记帐，写上合同，这样在树长大后，都有引起纠纷的可能，各县应以对群众负责的态度，协助各村，清理手续。
