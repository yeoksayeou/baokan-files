　　American Rulers Tremble Before Their Own Judgement
    He Sijing
    The American Communist Party's reactionary trial is the dark winter of the American people. But a bright spring will surely come, as long as the American people understand that they must use their own hands to take back everything that has been taken away. The unjust verdict of the U.S. Federal Court in New York has aroused the righteous indignation of the people all over the world, especially the indignation of all progressive people in the United States. This indignation will surely incite all Americans to use their own hands to regain the youth of justice.
    The U.S. Federal Court in New York is already trembling before its own illegal judgement, because its judgement has become its own confession of crime.
    Americans were once envied. Some of them did enjoy the happiness bestowed by ancestors like Franklin and Jefferson without much thought. They lived according to customary gifts. They didn't pay much attention to politics and allowed a few millionaires to manipulate politics without vigilance. The millionaires cultivated a group of political illusionists in their own dark rooms to act as cooks of American happiness, cooking up all kinds of low tastes to confuse the people and prevent them from thinking about other real happiness in the world. Then they fabricated all kinds of stinging rumors, as if the cooking of this low taste was about to be threatened. This is American politics.
    This time, the American rulers deprived the most advanced and upright Americans of their constitutional rights as a beginning, and will further deprive the rights of ordinary Americans. Americans can no longer regard the illegal deprivation of the rulers as other people's affairs. Americans must distinguish right from wrong. Americans cannot but pay attention to politics.
    The accomplished fact that has been placed before the Americans is that the U.S. Federal Court has tried the American Communist Party and sentenced it to heavy sentences. However, Americans will surely negate this verdict with the most reckless criticism. First of all, what law did the U.S. Federal Court in New York use? It used the Alien Registration Act or the Smith Act. Is it an anti-fascist law? It was formulated during the anti-fascist war and was also applied to fascist bandits. Then, does the U.S. Federal Court continue to oppose fascist bandits with anti-fascist laws? Since the U.S. Federal Court in New York used anti-fascist laws, then, logically, it should oppose fascism, right? Actually, it is not. The U.S. Federal Court in New York used the Alien Registration Act or the Smith Act to oppose the American Communist Party. Isn't the American Communist Party always an anti-fascist party? The U.S. Federal Court in New York uses anti-fascist laws to oppose an anti-fascist party. Isn't this a strange thing? Which side is anti-fascist? Alien Registration Act, Smith Act, Federal Court or American Communist Party, which side is truly and thoroughly anti-fascist? Only the American Communist Party, which has consistently supported Marxism-Leninism and socialism for thirty years, and was the first to resolutely stand up against fascism in American political life, is a truly and thoroughly anti-fascist party. The American rulers, the Federal Court, the Federal Government, and the Congress and the laws it made are tainted on the point of anti-fascism, whether before or after the war, especially after the war. This is an indisputable and well-known fact.
    The Alien Registration Act or the Smith Act is not a clear anti-fascist law at all, but a law made by the U.S. government for fear of being "overthrown or destroyed," but it was also applied to fascist bandits. This law cannot distinguish between fascist bandits and the truly and thoroughly anti-fascist force, the Communist Party, so this law is not a good law but an evil law. This shows the incompetence of the American rulers to distinguish between right and wrong, good and evil, and also shows their deliberate policy of fooling the people by not distinguishing between right and wrong, good and evil, and even more shows their deliberate and malicious conspiracy not to distinguish between right and wrong, good and evil, and this conspiracy has had the most appropriate expression in the illegal judgement of the Federal Court. The illegal verdict of the U.S. Federal Court in New York is a confession of the reactionary behavior of all reactionaries in the United States.
    In the trial of the American Communist Party leaders, the American reactionaries falsely accused the American Communist Party leaders of "attempting to overthrow the U.S. government by violence," and falsely accused the American Communist Party leaders of "knowingly or deliberately supporting, instigating, advising, or instigating the task, need, desire, or action of overthrowing the various levels of government in the United States or assassinating officials of various levels of government with violence or sabotage." It is a crime to use such provisions to deal with the American Communist Party. According to the statement of American Communist Party leader Foster, "The current central task of the American Communist Party is to protect workers from the ravages of the impending economic crisis by means of social insurance and other methods, to defeat the fascism that is growing in the United States, and to prevent the outbreak of a new world war being plotted by Wall Street tycoons." Who can say that such a just central task of the American Communist Party is a crime? Can "defeating the fascism that is growing in the United States," "preventing the outbreak of a new world war," and "overthrowing the various levels of government in the United States with violence or sabotage" be equated? If they can be equated, doesn't that mean admitting that the various levels of government in the United States are jackals of the same lair as fascism and the Wall Street tycoons who are plotting a new world war? Doesn't that mean admitting that the various levels of government in the United States and fascism and the plotters of a new world war are completely equal? As long as the American reactionaries are willing to equate them in this way, we will never violate the wishes of the American reactionaries and defend them for what they do not want. Although the American reactionaries are willing to equate them in this way, this equation cannot equate the American Communist Party's "defeating fascism" and "preventing the outbreak of a new world war" with the official so-called "overthrowing the government by violence," because these slogans of the American Communist Party have not clearly included all levels of government in the United States as fascism plotting a new world war. Even if the U.S. government is panicked and exposes its true colors and confesses its criminal psychology in the face of slogans such as "defeating fascism" and "preventing the outbreak of a new world war," it cannot arbitrarily conclude that the American Communist Party wants to "overthrow the government by violence" on the grounds of its own criminal psychology. The law never has the right to regard the defendant's non-existent intention as a criminal intention, and even less has the right to regard the defendant's non-existent behavior as a criminal behavior. If the American reactionaries do this, it is the crime of false accusation. However, after all, the American reactionaries use the illusions conceived by their sobs and whimpers to make testimonies. This proves that the political life of the Americans has entered the dark age of the Middle Ages. Let's see how a witness fabricates a terrifying scene! A Charles Nicotemos described in terror:
    "The American revolution is coming soon. This is the result of an invasion by 500,000 Red Army troops marching toward Detroit through Alaska and Canada."
    If this kind of sobbing and whimpering fabrication is regarded as testimony, it is the crime of perjury. However, the American court uses the illusions of lunatics to falsely accuse the most upright people in the United States. Who else do the American rulers want to deceive with "Western civilization"?
    This illegal verdict of the U.S. Federal Court in New York only shows one thing, that is: The American reactionaries are afraid that their fascism and the plot of a new world war will be opposed, prevented, and defeated by the broad masses of the people. Therefore, they strike first and threaten and even defeat the people's anti-fascist behavior with the crime of "overthrowing the government." This is the essence of the reactionary judiciary of the U.S. Federal Court in New York this time. This is a reactionary judiciary that takes the just actions of the American people against fascism as a crime, that is, a reactionary judiciary that is hostile to the American people. The judges will be judged. This is the historical and logical conclusion of this reactionary judiciary.
    The American reactionaries think that as long as a law is made, the government can become the permanent government of the thousand-year kingdom of imperialism, and the people will not think that the government's power is entirely due to the people's authorization. However, the American reactionaries are trembling. Because since capitalism has become imperialism, the broad masses of the people have increasingly suffered from the deprivation and plunder of the imperialists and have become proletarians who have nothing but to sell their labor force. Therefore, it has become increasingly difficult to even sell their labor force. The American reactionaries are trembling before their own criminal acts!
    They personally feel that the illegal verdict of the U.S. Federal Court in New York is another death knell for them, their doomsday is coming soon, the day they will be judged is coming soon; their laws have become illegal, their courts are illegal places, their verdicts will be judged by the people. Therefore, the American reactionaries are trembling.

　　美国统治者在自己的判决面前发抖
    何思敬
    美共之受反动审判是美国人民底阴暗的隆冬。但明媚的春天一定会到来，只要美国人民了解到用自己的双手去夺回曾被夺去的一切。美国纽约联邦法院底不正的判决已激动了全世界人民底义愤，尤其激动了美国一切进步人民底义愤，这义愤必将激动美国一切人民用自己的双手夺回正义的青春。
    美国纽约联邦法院已在自己的不法判决面前发抖，因它的判决已成为它自己的犯罪底供状。
    美国人曾被人羡慕过。他们有些人确曾不费思索地享受过象弗兰克林、杰弗逊那样的祖先们恩赐的幸福。他们依照习惯底恩赐来生活，他们不大过问政治，不加警惕地让少数亿万富翁来操纵政治，富翁们就在自己的暗室中培养了一批政治幻术家来充当美国幸福底烹调人，烹调出一切低级趣味来迷惑人民使人民不再思索人间其他真正的幸福，然后再捏造种种刺人的谣言，好象这低级趣味底烹调将受到威胁一样，这就是美国政治。
    这次美国统治者剥夺了最先进最正直的美国人在宪法上的权利作为开端，将进一步剥夺一般美国人底权利了。美国人对于统治者底不法的剥夺已不能当作别人底事体来傍观了，美国人不能不辨别是非了。美国人不能不过问政治了。
    已经摆在美国人面前的既成事实就是美国联邦法院审判了美共，并且判了重刑。然而美国人必将以最不顾虑的批判来否定这个判决。首先，美国纽约联邦法院用了什么法律呢？用了爱廉登法案或斯密斯法案。它是反法西斯的法律吗？它曾在反法西斯战争时期中被制定、也曾适用于法西斯匪徒。然而美国联邦法院用反法西斯的法律来继续反对法西斯匪徒吗？堂堂的美国纽约联邦法院既用了反法西斯的法律，那末，照逻辑来讲，就应该反对法西斯才对吧。其实不然。美国纽约联邦法院用爱廉登法案或斯密斯法案来反对了美国共产党。美国共产党不是向来反法西斯的政党吗？美国纽约联邦法院用反法西斯的法律来反对一个反法西斯的政党，岂不是怪事吗？究竟那一方面是反法西斯的呢？爱廉登法案、斯密斯法案、联邦法院或者美共，究竟那一方面是真正彻底反法西斯的呢？只有三十年来一贯拥护马列主义与社会主义，而且在美国政治生活中第一个坚决起来反法西斯的美共才是真正彻底的反法西斯的政党，而美国统治者们、联邦法院、联邦政府以及国会和它所制造的法律在反法西斯这点上无论在战前战后，尤其在战后，是有污点的，这是无可争辩的众所周知的事实。
    爱廉登法案或斯密斯法案根本不是明确的反法西斯的法律，只是美国政府唯恐被人“推翻或摧毁”而制造的法律，不过也曾适用于法西斯匪徒而已。这个法律不能分别法西斯匪徒与真正彻底反法西斯的力量即共产党，所以这个法律不是良法而是恶法，这表明美国统治者们不能分别正邪善恶的低能，也表明他们有意不分别正邪善恶的愚民政策，更表明他们故意不分别正邪善恶的恶毒预谋，而这预谋在联邦法院底不法判决中有了最适切的表达。美国纽约联邦法院底不法判决是美国一切反动派底反动行为底供状。
    美国反动派在对美共领袖们的审判中诬指美共领袖们“企图以暴力推翻美国政府”，诬控美共领袖们“明知或故意的拥护、煽动、劝告或者教唆用暴力或破坏来推翻美国的各级政府或者暗杀各级政府官员的任务、需要、愿望或行动”。用这种条文来对付美国共产党，这种使用法本身便是罪恶。根据美共领袖福斯特底声明，“目前美共底中心任务是用社会保险以及其他方法来保卫工人，不使遭受即将来临的经济危机的蹂躏，击溃正在美国增长的法西斯主义，阻止华尔街大亨们正在策动的新的世界大战的爆发”。目前美共底这样一个正义的中心任务谁能说是犯罪呢？难道“击溃正在美国增长的法西斯主义”，“阻止新的世界大战底爆发”和“用暴力或破坏来推翻美国各级政府”可以等同吗？如果可以等同，那岂不是等于承认美国各级政府和法西斯主义、和策动新的世界大战的华尔街大亨们是一邱之貉吗？岂不是等于承认美国各级政府和法西斯主义、和新的世界大战底策动者是完全可以等同吗？只要美国反动派愿意这样等同，我们决不违反美国反动派底这种愿望而替他们作他们所不希望的辩护。尽管美国反动派愿意这样等同，但这种等同还不能把美共“击溃法西斯主义”、“阻止新世界战争底爆发”和官方所谓“用暴力推翻政府”等同起来，因美共底这些口号还没有明确地把美国各级政府都当作策动新世界战争的法西斯主义包含在内。即使美国政府在“击溃法西斯主义”、“阻止新世界战争底爆发”等口号面前惊慌失措，不打自招地暴露了自己的真相，招认了自己的犯罪心理，但还不能以自己的犯罪心理为理由来武断美共要“用暴力推翻政府”。法律总没有权利把被告未有的意思当作犯罪意思，更没有权利把被告未有的行为当作犯罪行为。如果美国反动派竟这样做了，那就是诬告罪，然而，毕竟美国反动派用自己的唏嘶啼泪哑所构想的错觉来做证言，这证明美国人底政治生活已经进入了中世纪底黑暗时代。且看一个证人怎样虚构恐怖的情景吧！一个查尔斯、尼古提沫斯恐怖地描述道：
    “美国的革命即将来到。这是五十万红军经过阿拉斯加和加拿大向第特律进军的一次侵略的结果”。
    如果把这种唏嘶啼泪哑的虚构当作证言，那就是伪证罪。然而美国法院却把疯子底错觉来诬判美国最正直的人们，美国统治者们还要拿“西方文明”来欺骗谁呢？
    这次美国纽约联邦法院底不法判决只说明了一点，就是：美国反动派唯恐自己的法西斯主义与新世界大战底策动受到广大人民底反对、阻止与击溃，故先发制人，用“推翻政府”的罪名来威胁以至击溃人民底反法西斯主义的行为。这就是这次美国纽约联邦法院底反动司法底实质。这就是以美国人民反法西斯主义的正义行动为犯罪的反动司法、也就是以美国人民为敌的反动司法。审判者将受审判，这就是这种反动司法底历史的逻辑的归结。
    美国反动派以为只要制造一道法律，政府就可以变成帝国主义的千年王国底永久政府了，人民就不会想到政府之有权是完全由于人民之授权了。然而美国反动派正在发抖。因为自从资本主义变为帝国主义以来，广大人民越来越遭受帝国主义者底剥夺与掠夺而成为除了出卖自己的劳动力之外一无所有，因而连出卖自己的劳动力都越来越困难的无产者了。美国反动派正在自己的罪恶行为面前发抖！
    他们亲自感觉到美国纽约联邦法院底不法判决是他们底又一次的丧钟，他们底世界末日快到了，他们受审判的日子快到了；他们底法律已成为不法了，他们底法院是不法的场所了，他们底判决将受人民底审判了。所以美国反动派正在发抖。
