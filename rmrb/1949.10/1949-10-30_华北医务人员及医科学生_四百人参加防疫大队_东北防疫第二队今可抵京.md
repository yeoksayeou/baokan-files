　　[This News] The Epidemic Prevention Office of the Central Epidemic Prevention Committee is actively carrying out its work. As of yesterday, nearly 400 on-the-job medical personnel and medical school students had registered with the Epidemic Prevention Office and decided to join the epidemic prevention team. These include 30 members of the Epidemic Prevention Team of the Health Department of the North China People's Government, transferred back from Zhuoxian County, all of whom are key cadres and are expected to arrive in Beijing within three days; 280 students from North China Medical University who are interning at the General Hospital of the Army and in Tianjin and Baoding have decided to participate in full, with the exception of a very few who are physically weak; nine medical personnel from the Hebei Military Region and the Hebei Provincial Health Department arrived in Beijing today; and 45 medical cadres and students from the National No. 1 Midwifery School and 25 doctors and nurses from the People's Hospital are also participating.
