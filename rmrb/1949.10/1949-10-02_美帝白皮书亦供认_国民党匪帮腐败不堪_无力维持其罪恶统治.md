    U.S. Imperialist White Paper Also Admits That the Kuomintang Bandit Gang Was Incurably Corrupt and Incapable of Maintaining Its Criminal Rule
    Vyshinsky also said that, therefore, we can see that even a country like the United States, with billions of dollars, with armaments including the atomic bomb (the monopoly of the atomic bomb has disappeared from the United States), and by no means a weak country, cannot save the thoroughly rotten Kuomintang rule.
    Vyshinsky asked: Why is this? Then he said: Because the root cause of the matter does not depend on external forces, but entirely on the internal forces of China itself.
    Vyshinsky recounted the remarks made by Senator Connally, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee of the United States, which were published in the American newspapers. Connally opposed continued aid to the Kuomintang government, and pointed out that the head of this government had fled to Taiwan with 138 million U.S. dollars worth of gold belonging to the Chinese people.
    One can also cite U.S. Secretary of State Acheson's letter to President Truman, which serves as the preface to the White Paper on China issued by the U.S. Department of State. This letter states that many observers believe that they, that is, the government and the Kuomintang, are hopelessly corrupt, vying for official positions and power, and hoping that the U.S. Congress will win the war for them and maintain their power for them. The letter points out: These observers fear that the Kuomintang government has thus detached itself from the people, making it unable to maintain its power in the post-war competition for power.
    Vyshinsky said, I will not talk about the part of this letter that describes the reasons why the United States believes it may and must provide assistance to the Kuomintang government, but from the above, it is already completely clear that the cause of the Kuomintang government has been a permanent failure, this government has completely gone bankrupt, and it must bear the responsibility for its own bankruptcy. The failure of this government is caused by its entire policy and all its past indecent activities.
    Vyshinsky continued: It is clear that the issue raised by the representative of the Kuomintang is based on purposes and motives that have nothing in common with the purposes of the United Nations, and is artificially far-fetched. The deceptive trick proposed here for consideration by the Steering Committee has no basis in fact, logic, or law. The Soviet delegation firmly opposes the attempt to force the United Nations General Assembly to discuss this deceptive trick. The representative of the Kuomintang government did not attempt to perform here without the support of certain people abroad, or without the direct encouragement of these people. He used clearly provocative and defamatory methods in an attempt to force the United Nations General Assembly to do so through the Steering Committee and with its help.
    If the United Nations General Assembly violates justice and reason and decides to include this issue on the agenda of the General Assembly, this will be an act of anti-Soviet policy, this is a policy of inciting anti-Sovietism, which has nothing to do with preventing the so-called Soviet threat to China's independence and territorial integrity.

### 美帝白皮书亦供认  国民党匪帮腐败不堪  无力维持其罪恶统治

    美帝白皮书亦供认
   　国民党匪帮腐败不堪
   　无力维持其罪恶统治
    维辛斯基又说，因此，我们可以看到，甚至象美国这样的国家，它有着数以十亿计的美元，有着包括原子弹（原子弹的垄断已经从美国手上消失了）在内的军备而绝不是一个弱国，也挽救不了彻底腐烂了的国民党统治。
    维辛斯基问道：这是为什么？接着他说：因为事情的根本原因不是取决于外在的力量，而是完全取决于中国本身内部的力量。
    维辛斯基追述美报章曾经发表的美国参院外交委员会主席康纳利的谈话。康纳利反对继续援助国民党政府，并且指出这一政府的首脑，已经带着属于中国人民的价值达一亿三千八百万美元的黄金逃亡台湾。
    人们还可以援引作为美国国务院所发表的中国问题白皮书的序言的美国国务卿艾奇逊致总统杜鲁门的信。这封信里说，许多观察家认为，他们，即是说政府和国民党，腐败不堪，争夺官职和权力，并且希望美国国会替他们赢得战争和替他们保持权力。这封信指出：这些观察家担心，国民党政府因此使自己脱离人民，以致在战后竞争权力的时期中无力维持它的权力。
    维辛斯基说，我不谈这封信的未尾叙述美国认为可能与必须予国民党政府以援助之理由的那一部分，但是，从上所述，已经完全清楚，国民党政府的事业，已经是永远失败了的，这个政府已经完全破产，而且必须由它自己负破产的责任。这一政府的失败，是它的整个政策、它以往整个不体面的活动所造成的。
    维辛斯基接着说：很清楚地，国民党代表提出的问题，是由于与联合国的宗旨毫无共同点的目的和动机以及人为地牵强附会提出的。在这里，提出要求指导委员会考虑的欺骗勾当，在事实上、逻辑上和法律上都绝无根据。苏联代表团坚决反对，迫使联合国大会讨论这一欺骗勾当的企图。国民党政府代表不是没有得到外国某些人士的支持，或者不是没有这些人士的直接鼓励而企图在这里表演的，他以显然的挑衅毁谤的作法为手段，企图经过指导委员会并借其帮助而迫使联合国大会这样做。
    如果联合国大会违反正义与理智，决定将这个问题列入大会议程，这将是仇苏政策的行动之一，这是煽动反苏的政策，这与防止所谓苏联对中国独立与领土完整的威胁毫无关系。
