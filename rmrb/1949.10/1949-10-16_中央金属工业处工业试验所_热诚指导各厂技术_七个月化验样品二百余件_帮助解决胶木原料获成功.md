　　The Industrial Experiment Institute of the Central Metallurgical Industry Administration Enthusiastically Guides Technical Work in Various Factories
　　200 Sample Analyses Completed in Seven Months
　　Successful Assistance in Resolving Issues with Bakelite Raw Materials
    [Beijing News] The Industrial Experiment Institute of the Central Metallurgical Industry Administration, in response to the lack of technical experimental equipment in various factories, actively carries out various industrial experimental works, and has achieved many results in the past seven months, becoming an enthusiastic technical guide for various factories. The institute was originally under the Enterprise Department of the North China People's Government, and was transferred to the leadership of the Central Metallurgical Industry Administration in September. It currently has 52 specialized technical personnel and has six laboratories, including an industrial analysis laboratory, a fuel laboratory (including dyes), an inorganic chemistry laboratory (including electrochemistry and cloisonné enamel improvement), an oil and fat laboratory (including Bakelite), a fiber chemistry laboratory, and a brewing chemistry laboratory. During this period, the institute's technical assistance to various factories mainly involved analysis and testing and technical guidance. A total of 214 analyses and tests were conducted, with requests coming from public and private factories such as the Telecommunications Bureau, North China Steel Company, Beijing Trading Company, Jidong Mining Company, Datong Coal Mine, 70th Ordnance Factory, Yanjing Paper Mill, Xin Jian Glass Factory, Wanyuan Chemical Industry Cooperative, Zhonghua Chemical Cooperative, and Zhonghe Trading Company. The samples tested were mostly coal, ore, sulfuric acid, and lubricating oil. Recently, the institute also assisted the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce and the Industrial Association in testing 69 kinds of soaps for the soap-making industry, enabling each soap factory to clearly understand the shortcomings in the composition of their products in order to improve technology and enhance quality. The institute will also assist relevant authorities in carrying out inspection of various industrial finished products. Regarding technical consultation and guidance, a total of 14 cases have been handled in the past seven months. Some were answered by the institute, while others involved the institute sending personnel to the factory for on-site guidance. For example, Changxindian Yiheyong Distillery planned to switch industries but did not know what production would be most marketable, requesting guidance from the institute. Based on the distillery's original power machinery and equipment, and in order to meet the current needs of the textile industry for yarn sizing, the institute suggested switching to the production of starch using white corn, changing from a consumption industry to a production industry. All technical work was designed and guided by personnel sent by the institute to the factory, resulting in very good results. Their products are superior to general goods on the market, with a daily output of one ton of starch, which will be entirely supplied to the China Textile Corporation for yarn sizing. Another example is that raw materials for Bakelite have always relied on foreign countries. Tianjin China Vegetable Oil Plant plans to use its own rice husk extract to manufacture Bakelite, and Taiyuan Bakelite Plant also hopes to solve the problem of Bakelite raw materials, requesting the Industrial Experiment Institute to study manufacturing methods. After months of effort by the institute, it has been successful. Rice husk extract can be extracted from cottonseed hulls or made from rice bran, wheat bran, and corn cobs to replace formaldehyde in the production of Bakelite. In this way, China can manufacture completely domestic Bakelite, which can save a large amount of light metal in industrial applications. Other examples, such as Yanjing Paper Mill using rice straw to make paper pulp, Dachang Chemical Cooperative improving the quality of Triangle brand toothpaste, Zhang Wenling Factory improving the manufacture of pure gypsum, and the electroplating and electrolysis problems of the Ge Da Fine Arts Supply Cooperative, have all been successfully guided by the Industrial Experiment Institute. In addition, the institute participated in the evaluation work of the Municipal Industrial Exhibition in June, inspecting 79 samples, which also greatly contributed to the improvement of technology. The institute also participated in technical seminars convened by the former Bureau of Industry and Commerce and the Industrial Association for the soap-making industry, the mechanized flour industry, the soy sauce industry, the kiln industry, specialized handicrafts, the printing industry, and the weaving and dyeing industry, providing many suggestions for improving production technology in each industry.
    In addition, the institute's regular research work has also achieved many successes. Engineer Yin Huaixin has successfully developed an "electroplating pen," allowing electroplating without the need to put items into an electroplating tank, making industrial use more convenient than before. Recently, the research on using glass welding instead of silver welding has also been successful. Worker Ding Yuwen invented the manufacturing of positive blueprints; ordinary blueprints are blue background with white lines and are negative images, while now it is possible to print white background with blue lines, a positive image. The institute is also carrying out many ongoing research projects, such as using sesame stalks and Northwest weaving machine grass to manufacture raw materials for high-grade security paper, modifying vulcanized blue, Haichang blue, and indanthrene dyes, and using various vegetable oils produced in North China to manufacture paints, inks, and lubricating oils.

　　中央金属工业处工业试验所 　 热诚指导各厂技术
    七个月化验样品二百余件
  　帮助解决胶木原料获成功
    【北京讯】中央金属工业处工业试验所针对各工厂技术实验设备缺乏的情况，积极进行各种工业试验工作，七个月来已获不少成绩，成为各工厂热诚的技术导师。该所原属华北人民政府企业部，九月起改由中央金属工业处领导，现有专门技术人员五十二人，设有工业分析室、燃料实验室（包括染料）、无机化学试验室（包括电化学、景泰蓝改良）、油脂试验室（包括胶木）、纤维化学试验室和酿造化学试验室等六个试验室。这一时期中，该所对各工厂的技术协助，主要为分析化验及技术指导。分析化验共有二百一十四件，请求化验的公私营工厂有：电信局、华北钢铁公司、北京贸易公司、冀东矿业公司、大同煤矿、七十兵工厂、燕京造纸厂、新建玻璃厂、万源化学工业社、中华化学社、中和商行等。化验的样品以煤、矿石、硫酸、润滑油为最多。最近该所并协助市工商局、工业会给造胰同业公会化验六十九种肥皂，使各造胰工厂明确了解自己的出品在成分上有哪些缺点，以改进技术提高品质。该所并将协助有关机关对各种工业成品实行检定。关于技术咨询指导工作，七个月来共处理了十四件，有的由该所提出解答，有的则由该所派人到工厂实地指导。象长辛店义和永公记烧锅计划转业，但不了解生产什么最有销路，请求该所指导，该所即根据烧锅原有的动力机器设备，并为适应当前纺织工业浆纱的需要，乃建议改用白玉米生产淀粉，由消费行业变为生产行业。其全部技术工作都由该所派人到厂设计和指导，结果成绩很好他们的出品比市场一般货品优良，每天可产淀粉一吨，将全数供应中纺公司浆纱。又如做胶木的原料一向依赖外国，天津中国植物油料厂拟用自己出产的糠＠制造胶木，太原胶木厂也希望解决胶木原料问题，请求工业试验所研究制造方法。经该所数月努力，已获成功，可用棉子壳提出糠＠或从米糠、麸皮、玉米心制造糠＠代替甲＠生产胶木，这样，中国便可制造完全国货的胶木，在工业应用上能节省大量轻金属。再如：燕京造纸厂用稻草制造纸浆、大昌化工社改进三角牌牙膏品质、张文苓工厂改进制造纯净石膏、革大美术供应社电镀电解问题等等，都是由工业试验所指导成功的。此外，该所六月中参加本市工业展览会评议工作，检定样品七十九件，对改进技术收效也很大。该所并随时参加了前工商局、工业会所召集的造胰业、机制面粉业、酱油业、窑业、特种手工业、印刷业、织染业等技术座谈会，给各业生产技术提出很多改进意见。
    此外，该所经常的研究工作也有很多成就，工程师尹怀莘把“电镀笔”研究成功镀电可无须放入电镀槽，工业使用较前便利；近又研究用玻璃焊代替银焊也告成功；工作员丁玉文发明制造正线蓝图，普通蓝图是蓝地白图是负像，现在则可晒白地蓝图正像。该所正在进行的研究工作也很多，例如用胡麻杆同西北织机草制造高级证券用纸的原料，改造硫化蓝、海昌蓝、阴丹士林染料，利用华北盛产的各种植物油制造油漆、油墨、润滑油等。
