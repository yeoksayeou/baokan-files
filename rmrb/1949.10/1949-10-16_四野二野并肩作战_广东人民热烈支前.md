　　The Fourth and Second Field Armies Fight Side by Side
　　Guangdong People Enthusiastically Support the Front

Our army faced exceptional hardships during the southward advance. All commanders and fighters, encouraged by the proclamation of the Central People's Government, were in high spirits, eager to swiftly strike Guangzhou. Disregarding all fatigue, they advanced bravely day and night, braving torrential rain, covering distances of a hundred to a hundred and fifty li each day. During the valiant advance, a unit of the Fourth Field Army from the banks of the Songhua River fought side by side with a unit of the Second Field Army from the Shanxi Plateau, showing close unity and fraternal affection. A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, forged in the crucible of war, crossed mountains and ridges without fear of long marches in order to quickly liberate their hometown. The people of Guangdong, rich in revolutionary tradition, also welcomed the army with unparalleled enthusiasm and vigorously supported the fighting. The various units of the South China Liberation Army, who had persisted in arduous anti-enemy struggles behind enemy lines for more than a decade, also victoriously joined forces with the southward advancing army on the battlefield amidst jubilation.

Since the 8th of this month, our armies have been advancing south along the Yuehan Railway and the banks of the North River and East River. The western route forces crushed enemy resistance in the Yingde and Qingyuan areas, liberated towns such as Ruyuan, Yingde, Qingyuan, and Sanshui, wiped out the bulk of the 91st Division of the enemy's 39th Army, and routed the enemy's 103rd and 147th Divisions of the 39th Army, and the 211th and 213th Divisions of the 23rd Army. The vanguard reached north of Guangzhou on the 14th. The central route army advanced along the Wengyuan-Guangzhou highway, successively liberating Xinfeng, Fogang, Huaxian, Conghua, and Zengcheng. They also cut the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway at the Shitan Station, repelled enemy ambushes several times along the way, and successively wiped out the 307th Regiment of the 103rd Division of the enemy's 39th Army and the 963rd Regiment of the 321st Division of the enemy's 50th Army, also reaching the northern suburbs of Guangzhou on the 14th. Certain units of the Eastern Route Liberation Army and the various units of the South China People's Liberation Army also successively liberated important towns such as Wengyuan, Heyuan, Longmen, Longchuan, Heping, and Lianping, actively operating on various communication lines, controlling and disrupting the enemy, and sending a part of their forces to the south of Guangzhou, threatening the enemy's rear. At 6:30 PM on the 14th, the vanguard of the left-wing army entered the central area of Guangzhou City from the northern suburbs, and victoriously joined forces with the Liberation Army of ×× unit, which entered the urban area from the eastern suburbs along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, and quickly completely liberated the largest city in southern China.

Under our powerful offensive, the enemy's deployment completely disintegrated, and they fled in disarray. The enemy troops defending Guangzhou began to retreat from the 11th, and began setting fires in the urban area from the 13th, burning warehouses and some factories, and destroying the Zhujiang Bridge in the southern suburbs.

When the Liberation Army entered the urban area, millions of citizens lined the streets to welcome them, with cheers shaking the sky. The Liberation Army is now taking advantage of the victory to pursue and annihilate the fleeing enemy on multiple routes.

　　四野二野并肩作战
  　广东人民热烈支前
    我军在南进中艰苦异常。全体指战员为中央人民政府的宣告成立所鼓舞，士气高昂，渴望迅速直捣广州，不顾一切疲劳，夜以继日，冒滂沱大雨，奋勇前进，每日行程均达百里至一百五十里。在奋勇进军途中，来自松花江岸的第四野战军某部与来自山西高原的第二野战军某部并肩作战，亲密团结，充满手足情谊。在战争中锻炼成钢的解放军某部，为迅速解放家乡而翻山越岭，不怕长途跋涉。富有革命传统的广东人民，亦以无比热情欢迎大军，热烈支援作战。十余年来坚持敌后艰苦斗争的华南解放军各部，亦在狂欢中相继与南下大军在战场上胜利会师。
    自本月八日起，我各路大军分沿粤汉铁路、北江、东江两岸南进。西路连在英德、清远地区粉碎敌匪抵抗，解放乳源、英德、清远、三水等城镇，歼灭敌三十九军九十一师大部，击溃敌三十九军一零三师、一四七师及二十三军二一一师、二一三师等部，先头部队于十四日进抵广州以北。中路军则沿翁源通广州公路前进，连续解放新丰、佛冈、花县、从化、增城，并在石滩车站切断广九铁路，沿途数次排除敌匪阻击，先后歼灭敌三十九军一零三师三零七团及敌五十军三二一师九六三团，于十四日亦进抵广州北郊。东路解放军某部及华南人民解放军各部亦相继解放翁源、河源、龙门、龙川、和平、连平等重要城镇，在各交通线积极活动，控制扰乱敌人，并以一部驰往广州以南，威胁敌背。十四日下午六时三十分，左路军先头部队即自北郊进入广州市中心区，并与沿广九铁路自东郊进入市区的××部解放军胜利会师，迅即全部解放北一中国南部最大都市。
    在我强大攻势之下，敌军部署全部瓦解，纷纷溃逃。广州守敌十一日起即开始撤退，十三日起开始在市区纵火焚烧，爆炸仓库及若干工厂，并破坏南郊珠江大桥。
    当解放军开入市区时，千万市民夹道相迎，欢声雷动。现解放军正乘胜分路追歼溃敌中。
