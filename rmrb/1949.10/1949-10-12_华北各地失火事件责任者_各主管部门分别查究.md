　　Regarding the explosions and fires that have occurred in various parts of North China, the relevant departments have recently conducted further investigations and have taken disciplinary actions. In one case, a fire occurred in the completion department of a certain branch factory under a certain factory affiliated with the Public Enterprise Department's Ordnance Bureau. The factory director, Hao Shuling, received a major demerit, and the foreman, Wang Shuntang, was removed from his position and had his salary reduced for three months. A fire occurred in the drying room of the completion department of a certain branch factory of a certain factory. The factory director, Liu Kan, received a demerit. A fire occurred in the completion department of a certain branch factory of a certain factory. The factory director, Shen Wenkui, received a major demerit, and the deputy factory director, Qin Qiuwen, received a demerit. A detonator explosion occurred in a certain factory. The foremen, Wei Zhenxiang and Huang Fushun, received demerits, and the factory director, Shen Dingxiang, and deputy factory director, Chen Haiqing, were criticized in a circular. A fire occurred in the absorbent cotton drying room of a certain factory, and the worker, Zhang Sanwen, was dismissed. In addition, an underground fire occurred in the Huangtugang coal mine of the Xinhua Coal Industry Company, resulting in numerous worker deaths and injuries. The relevant departments have also investigated these incidents and imposed penalties based on the severity of the circumstances. The main reasons for the continued occurrence of these incidents are the leaders' consistent paralysis of thought, inadequate prevention or inspection, and the failure of staff to comply with work rules. Furthermore, the lack of thorough reviews and corrective measures after the fact has led to repeated incidents. This irresponsible attitude, the failure to seriously value and protect the people's property, deserves punishment and education.

　　华北各地失火事件责任者
    各主管部门分别查究
    【本报讯】华北各地所发生之爆炸失火事件，最近又经主管部门分别查究，予以处分者，有公营企业部兵工局所属某厂某分厂完成部失火，厂长郝书岭记大过，领工王顺堂撤职降薪三个月。某厂某分厂完成部烘房失火，厂长刘侃记过。某厂某分厂，完成部失火，厂长申文魁记大过，副厂长秦秋文记过。某厂雷管爆炸，工长魏祯祥、黄福顺记过，厂长沈丁祥与副厂长陈海清通令批评。某厂脱脂棉烘房失火，工人张三文开除。另有新华煤业公司黄土岗煤窑井下失火，死伤工人多名等事件，亦经主管部门查究，按情节轻重予以处分。这类事情的不断发生，主要原因在于领导者思想一贯麻痹，防范或检查不严，以及工作人员不遵守工作规则所致；加以事后又无深刻检讨与提出纠正办法，致屡肇事端。此种不负责态度，不严肃重视保护人民财产，实应受到惩处教育。
