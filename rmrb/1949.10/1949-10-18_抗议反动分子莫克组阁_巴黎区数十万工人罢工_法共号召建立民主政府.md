　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 17th: According to TASS, Paris: Hundreds of thousands of working people in the Paris area, responding to the call of the Seine branch of the French General Confederation of Labor (CGT), strongly protested the appointment of Mock as Prime Minister and demanded the establishment of a unified democratic government. They held strikes, short work stoppages, mass rallies, assemblies, and demonstrations, and sent delegations to petition the French National Assembly to express their demands. According to newspaper reports, many enterprises in Paris and other towns in the Seine province held strikes or slowdowns on the 13th.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 17th: TASS, Paris, 15th: The Political Bureau of the French Communist Party held a meeting on the 14th, presided over by General Secretary Thorez, and passed a resolution expressing brotherly sympathy to the Seine deputies in the National Assembly, led by Duclos, who are conducting a heroic struggle against the reactionaries. Duclos had fiercely denounced Mock's fascist methods and police repression at a meeting of the National Assembly. The Political Bureau believes that this resolution expresses the sincere feelings of all honest people in France. The French people are indignant at the conspiracies carried out, with the participation of National Assembly Speaker Herriot, to ensure the passage of Mock's regime by a majority of one vote, and warmly salute Duclos, who has been valiantly defending the demands of the working class and the interests of the people and France. The Political Bureau calls on all workers and democrats to unite and demand the establishment of a unified democratic government. Only such a government can realize a program of prosperity, freedom, defense of national independence, and peace that meets the aspirations of the whole country.

　　抗议反动分子莫克组阁
  　巴黎区数十万工人罢工
    法共号召建立民主政府
    【新华社北京十七日电】据塔斯社巴黎讯：巴黎区数十万劳动人民响应法国总工会塞纳省所属工会之号召，强烈抗议任命莫克为政府总理，并要求成立民主统一政府。他们举行罢工、短时停工、群众集会、大会及示威游行，并派遣代表团向法国民议会请愿，以表达他们的要求。据各报消息称，十三日，巴黎及塞纳省其他各城镇许多企业都举行了罢工或怠工。
    【新华社北京十七日电】塔斯社巴黎十五日讯：法共政治局十四日在总书记多列士主持下举行会议，并通过决议，向在国民议会中对反动派进行英勇斗争的塞纳省议员杜克洛表示兄弟般的同情。杜克洛曾在国民议会的会议上，痛斥莫克的法西斯手段和警察镇压。政治局相信这一决议表达了法国一切正直人民的真挚的情感。法国人民对于在国民议会议长赫里欧的参与下，为了保证以一票之多数通过莫克的政权而进行的阴谋诡计，感到愤慨，并向以奋励英勇保卫工人阶级要求，及人民与法兰西的利益的杜克洛热烈致敬。政治局号召一切工人和民主分子团结起来，要求成立民主统一的政府。只有这样的政府，才能实现符合全国愿望的繁荣、自由、保卫民族独立与和平的纲领。
