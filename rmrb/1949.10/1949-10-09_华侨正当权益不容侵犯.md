Under the reactionary policies of imperialism and fascist chauvinism, the Australian government and the British colonial authorities in Malaya are demonstrating their barbarity to the world with their crimes of violently rejecting overseas Chinese. The Australian Minister for Immigration, Calwell, ordered the arrest of 500 overseas Chinese on August 24 and deported them; a few days before that, 25 Chinese sailors were arrested; as early as April this year, many overseas Chinese were detained by the Australian government; now, they have ordered the expulsion of 2,000 overseas Chinese and people of other Asian nationalities who have resided in Australia for many years. In Malaya, overseas Chinese have also been subjected to inhuman treatment for a long time. Overseas Chinese who refused to cooperate with the British colonialists in suppressing the Malayan people's revolutionary movement have been driven out of their villages many times, and entire villages inhabited by overseas Chinese have been set on fire by the British colonialists. Recently, thousands more overseas Chinese have been expelled from Malaya, and many others have been brutally murdered or imprisoned.

The Chinese people cannot sit idly by in the face of these bloody facts. We firmly oppose the imperialist and fascist chauvinist atrocities of the Australian government and the British colonial authorities in Malaya. The people of Australia and Malaya, and the overseas Chinese, should rise up and force the reactionary authorities to abolish all illegal "decrees" that serve as pretexts for these atrocities.

What we oppose is only the atrocities of imperialism. The people of Australia and Malaya are friends we want to unite with. Australian workers have assisted the Chinese people by refusing to transport munitions. The Australian people have continuously supported the overseas Chinese while the Australian government authorities persecuted them. The national liberation struggle waged by the Malayan people is unanimously sympathized with by our people. The people of Australia and Malaya are all good friends of the Chinese people. It is not they who are anti-Chinese, but those who oppress them. Their struggle against the oppressors cannot be suppressed by any reactionary force. The reactionary rulers' barbaric acts of anti-Chinese discrimination will not help their ever-weakening rule. The emergence of the People's Republic of China, the bulwark of Eastern democracy and peace, has opened up a broader path for the people's democratic and national liberation movements throughout the East.

Overseas Chinese had long lost their true motherland. The traitorous Kuomintang bandits not only failed to protect the interests of overseas Chinese, but also colluded with imperialists to persecute overseas Chinese, causing the compatriots in various places to suffer for a long time and unable to hold their heads high. Now, the People's Republic of China has been established, and overseas Chinese have a true motherland. The new China of the people will never allow imperialists to trample on overseas Chinese at will again. Article 58 of the People's New China's Great Charter—the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference—clearly states: "The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China shall do its best to protect the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese." We call on overseas Chinese to unite under this program, support the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, resist the atrocities of imperialism and fascist chauvinism, and fight to protect the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese.

### 华侨正当权益不容侵犯

　　华侨正当权益不容侵犯
    澳大利亚政府和马来亚英殖民当局，在帝国主义与法西斯沙文主义的反动政策支配之下，正在用横暴排斥华侨的罪行向全世界证明他们的野蛮。澳移民部长加尔威尔在八月二十四日就曾下令逮捕五百名华侨，并把他们驱逐出境；在那以前几天，还逮捕了二十五名中国海员；早在今年四月，就有华侨多人被澳政府拘押；现在，他们又下令要把在澳居留多年的两千华侨和亚洲其他民族人民一齐赶出来。在马来亚，华侨也长时期受着非人的待遇，不肯和英国殖民者合作镇压马来亚人民革命运动的华侨，曾多次被从他们居住的村庄赶出来，有的华侨聚居的整个村子被英殖民者放火烧掉。最近，又有数千华侨被驱逐出马来亚，还有许多人惨遭杀害或遭监禁。
    中国人民对这些血腥的事实决不能坐视，我们坚决反对澳政府和马来亚英殖民当局的帝国主义与法西斯沙文主义的暴行，澳大利亚与马来亚的人民和华侨应该起来，迫使反动当局取消那些作为演出这些暴行的借口的一切非法的“法令”。
    我们所反对的只是帝国主义的暴行，澳大利亚和马来亚人民，则是我们所要团结的友人。澳大利亚工人曾以拒绝搬运军火的行动援助过中国人民，澳大利亚人民在澳政府当局迫害华侨的时候不断支援着华侨；马来亚人民所进行的民族解放斗争尤为我国人民所一致同情的；澳大利亚、马来亚人民都是中国人民的好朋友，排华的不是他们，而是压迫他们的人。他们反抗压迫者的斗争是任何反动力量所镇压不了的；反动统治者排华的野蛮行为也决无补于他们的统治的日益削弱；东方民主和平堡垒中华人民共和国的出现，已为整个东方的人民民主与民族解放运动开辟了更为广阔的道路。
    海外华侨曾长时期失去了他们真正的祖国，卖国的国民党匪帮不但不能保护华侨的利益，反而是勾结着帝国主义者迫害华侨，使各地侨胞长期受着苦难，抬不起头来。现在，中华人民共和国已经成立了，华侨有了真正的祖国了，人民的新中国决不容许帝国主义者再把华侨任意践踏，在新中国的人民大宪章——人民政协共同纲领的第五十八条明明白白地写着：“中华人民共和国中央人民政府应尽力保护国外华侨的正当权益。”我们号召国外华侨在这个纲领之下一致团结起来，拥护中华人民共和国中央人民政府，反抗帝国主义与法西斯沙文主义的暴行，为保护华侨的正当权益而斗争。
