　　Struggle to Crush New Schemes of Aggressive War
    Guo Moruo's Report at the Founding Meeting of the China Committee for the Defense of World Peace
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 2nd] Guo Moruo, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the China Committee for the Defense of World Peace, delivered a report entitled "Struggle to Crush New Schemes of Aggressive War" at the founding meeting of the committee on the 2nd. The full text of the report is as follows:
    Today is the International Day of Struggle for Peace, as decided by the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace. The Peace Congress calls on all peace-loving forces in the world to take united action on this day to hold large-scale rallies and demonstrations to defend peace and oppose the danger of new wars, so as to further advance the world people's peace movement. Peace-loving people in all countries of the world have risen up to respond to this call, and the Chinese people have also risen up to respond to this call, and have decided to convene the China Committee for the Defense of World Peace here, to express the firm determination of the Chinese people to defend world peace and oppose new aggressive wars, and to closely connect and cooperate with the peace movement all over the world, to defeat the war policies of the instigators of new wars, and to strive for the victory of peace.
    The people need peace because they are absolutely unwilling to sacrifice for the benefit of a few monopolistic capitalists for no reason. However, the international reactionaries, headed by U.S. imperialism, are all attempting to launch wars to maintain their excess profits and to try to avoid or alleviate the serious economic crisis they are already facing. They have adopted fascist means of intimidation to frighten peace-loving people, dreaming of clearing the way for launching aggressive wars, but this is completely futile. Peace-loving people have not been intimidated, and they can never be intimidated. The movement to defend world peace is growing stronger and stronger day by day.
    Since the World Congress of Supporters of Peace was held simultaneously in Paris and Prague in April this year, it has only been five months, and the great movement to defend peace, under the leadership of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace, has become more developed, stronger, and more organized. Peace committees have been established in the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Romania, Hungary, Finland, the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Italy, France, Germany, Greece, and many other countries, to unify the leadership of the people of these countries in carrying out the struggle for peace. The International Youth and Student Festival and the Second International Youth Congress, held in August and September, demonstrated that international democratic youth are further united in the cause of fighting for peace, democracy, and independence. The movement to defend peace that has been launched in capitalist countries is of great significance and deserves special mention, such as in France, Italy, and Latin America. In France, the French people launched a large-scale peace voting movement in response to the "International Day of Struggle for Peace." Despite the French reactionary government's adoption of various despicable means such as threats, intimidation, and persecution in an attempt to sabotage this movement, the peace voting has become a movement that has spread throughout France. In Italy, the Italian people launched a signature campaign to oppose the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty. The Italian reactionary government used violence to suppress it and threw thousands of Italians into prison, but still seven million people signed the petition against the North Atlantic Treaty. In the Americas, U.S. imperialism regards this place as its base of aggression and its most reliable rear, but facts have proved that U.S. imperialism is still dreaming there. On September 5, the countries of the Americas held the Pan-American Peace Congress in Mexico City, firmly expressing their determination and willingness to oppose war and support peace. The convening of this congress shows that the so-called reliable rear of U.S. imperialism is also shaking at its roots.
    In the face of this unprecedentedly powerful peace movement, the warmongers, headed by U.S. imperialism, are trembling, they are panicking, they are forced to negotiate with the Soviet Union, and they resumed the long-stalled foreign ministers' conference in May of this year, and were forced to make some concessions on the issues of Germany and Austria. Although the American reactionaries are currently attempting to overturn the agreements reached at the foreign ministers' conference and are acting in fundamental violation of the spirit of the foreign ministers' conference, in any case, up to this day, they still have to continue negotiations with the Soviet Union. Here, the weakness and the appearance of being strong on the outside but weak on the inside of U.S. imperialism is fully exposed.
    However, we must not forget that the American imperialist adventurers have not only not given up, but the closer their economic crisis gets, the more frantically they will struggle. They are currently continuing to intensify their evil activities of preparing for war, frantically engaging in an arms race, and the danger of a new war is still actually threatening the peace-loving people of the world. The North Atlantic Treaty, which is a tool of war, has been ratified and is being implemented at an accelerated pace. The "Military Aid to Foreign Countries Plan," which is a supplement to this war treaty, is currently in its final discussion in the U.S. Congress. The conspiracy to revive German and Japanese militarism and make them important accomplices in a new war has become more and more open and more and more unscrupulous. Under the support of U.S. imperialism, the puppet government of Western Germany, filled with Nazi murderers, has been formally established, and a policy of "undeclared peace" is openly implemented towards Japan, and it is doing its best to restore Japan's war industry and rearm the Japanese aggressors. At the same time, U.S. imperialism is also plotting the so-called Pacific Alliance, continuing to support the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous government, attempting to suppress the people's movement in the East, and continuing its crimes against the new China. All this proves that the warmongers are trying to push mankind into an unprecedentedly brutal new war, which makes "peace in crisis."
    However, we firmly believe that this danger can be completely overcome, because the strength of the peace and democracy camp, headed by the Soviet Union, has greatly exceeded the strength of the imperialist aggression camp.
    The national strength of the Soviet Union, the fortress of world peace, is growing unprecedentedly. The recent TASS statement that the Soviet Union already possesses atomic weapons signifies that the strength of the world peace camp is even stronger, and the warmongers' attempt to scare people with atomic bombs has also gone bankrupt. The people's democratic countries of Eastern Europe are further consolidating and growing stronger. The people of capitalist countries are mobilizing, uniting, and organizing under the slogan of striving for peace. In China, our people's revolutionary war has been victorious, the Central People's Government, which the people of the whole country have been eagerly awaiting, has been established, which is a great victory for the world peace camp and a great failure for the imperialist aggressive war. The formal participation of China's 475 million people in the peace camp headed by the Soviet Union has made the strength of the peace camp even stronger and the strength of the aggression camp even weaker. In order to further strike at the imperialist aggressors and consolidate the peace and democracy camp, the Chinese people will continue to work hard to eliminate the remaining forces of the domestic reactionaries, and use their main strength to restore and develop the people's economy and culture. At the same time, we will establish a national committee of the China Committee for the Defense of World Peace at this conference, so as to strengthen the Chinese people's work for lasting world peace in a more planned and step-by-step manner, and establish closer ties with the peace and democracy movements of various countries.
    We firmly believe that as long as the peace-loving people of all countries are vigilant, continue to strengthen the struggle, and closely unite around the powerful peace fortress of the Soviet Union, and unite around the great leader of mankind, Stalin, the plans of the war adventurers will definitely be smashed to pieces; let the call in the declaration of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace become the united action of the people of the whole world to answer the conspiracies of the warmongers! "Fight bravely and confidently for peace!" Here we want to shout:
    We oppose aggressive wars!
    We support world peace!
    Down with the instigators of war!
    Long live the People's Republic of China, the strong supporter of the world peace camp!
    Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people!
    Long live the Soviet Union, the leader of the world peace camp!
    Long live Marshal Stalin, the great leader and teacher of the working people of the world!
    Long live people's democracy and lasting peace!

　　为粉碎新的侵略战争阴谋而斗争
    郭沫若在中国保卫世界和平大会成立大会报告
    【新华社北京二日电】中国保卫世界和平大会筹委会主任郭沫若二日在该会成立大会上作了题为：“为粉碎新的侵略战争阴谋而斗争”的报告，报告全文如下：
    今天，是世界拥护和平大会常设委员会决定的国际和平斗争日，和平大会号召全世界和平力量，要在这一天一致行动起来，举行保卫和平反对新战争危险的大集会和大示威，以便把世界人民的和平运动更进一步地推向前进。世界各国爱好和平的人们，都已经奋起响应这个号召，中国人民也同样奋起响应这个号召，并决定在这里召开中国保卫世界和平大会，来表示中国人民保卫世界和平、反对新侵略战争的坚强决心，并和遍及全世界的和平运动密切联系，互相配合，击破新战争挑拨者的战争政策，争取和平的胜利。
    人民需要和平，因为他们决不愿意为少数独占资本家的利益而无缘无故的牺牲。但是，以美帝国主义为首的国际反动派，他们都企图发动战争，来维持他们的超额利润，并企图避免或减轻他们业已面临的严重的经济危机。他们采取了法西斯的恐吓手段，来吓唬和平的人们；梦想为发动侵略战争，清扫道路，但这是完全无济于事的，爱好和平的人民没有被吓倒，而且也决不可能被吓倒。保卫世界和平的运动，正一天比一天扩大而坚强起来了。
    自从今年四月在巴黎和布拉格两地同时召开世界拥护和平大会以来，到现在还仅仅五个月，保卫和平的大运动在世界拥护和平大会常设委员会的领导下，是更加发展更加壮大和更加具有组织性了。苏联、捷克、波兰、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、芬兰、美国、英国、加拿大、意大利、法国、德国、希腊以及其他许多国家，都已成立了和平委员会，统一领导各该国人民进行争取和平的斗争。八、九月间举行的国际青年与学生联欢大会，和国际青年第二次代表大会，表现了国际民主青年在为和平民主和独立而斗争的事业中，更进一步地团结起来了。在资本主义各国内所展开的保卫和平的运动，是有重要意义而值得特别提出的，是法国、意大利、和拉丁美洲。在法国，法国人民为了响应“国际和平斗争日”，曾展开了大规模的和平投票运动，尽管法国反动政府采取各种威胁、恫吓和迫害等卑鄙手段，企图破坏这一运动，但和平投票已成为遍及全法的运动。在意大利，意大利人民为了反对侵略性的北大西洋公约，曾发动了一个签名运动，意大利反动政府曾用暴力大肆镇压，把数千意大利人投入监狱，但还是有七百万人在反对北大西洋公约的请愿书上签了名。在美洲，美国帝国主义把这里当作是它们侵略的根据地和最可靠的后方，但是事实证明美国帝国主义依然在那里做梦。九月五日，美洲各国在墨西哥城举行了全美洲和平大会，坚决表示了反对战争、拥护和平的决心和意愿，这个大会的召开，表明了美国帝国主义的所谓可靠后方也连根动摇了。
    在这种空前强大的和平运动的面前，以美国帝国主义为首的战争贩子们，它们发抖了，它们惊惶失措了，它们被迫不得不跟苏联进行谈判，在本年五月恢复了停顿已久的外长会议，并被迫在德、奥问题上作了若干让步。虽然目前美国反动派正在企图推翻外长会议所取得的协议，根本违反外长会议的精神行事，但无论如何它们一直到今天为止，还不得不和苏联继续进行谈判。在这里，美帝国主义的软弱和外强中干的真面目是完全暴露出来了。
    但是，我们不能忘记，美国帝国主义冒险家不仅还没有死心，它们的经济危机愈迫近，他们便要愈加疯狂的挣扎。他们目前正在继续加紧备战的罪恶活动，疯狂地进行着军备竞赛，新战争的危险依旧在实际上威胁着世界爱好和平的人民。作为战争工具的北大西洋公约已经批准，并正在加紧实施中。作为这一战争公约补充的“军事援外计划”，目前已在美国国会中作最后讨论。复活德日军国主义而使它们充当新战争的重要帮凶的阴谋，已愈来愈公开，愈来愈肆无忌惮了。在美国帝国主义扶植下。西部德国的充满纳粹杀人犯的傀儡政府已经正式建立，对日本则公开实行“不宣而和”的政策，极力恢复日本的战争工业，重新武装日本侵略者。美国帝国主义同时还在策动所谓太平洋联盟，继续支持蒋介石卖国政府的残余势力，企图镇压东方的人民运动，并继续其反对新中国的罪行。这一切，都证明了战争贩子们正企图把人类推入空前残酷的新战争中去。就使得“和平处在危机之中。”
    但是，我们坚信：这种危险是完全可以被克服的，因为以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的力量，已大大超过了帝国主义侵略阵营的力量。
    世界和平的堡垒苏联的国力正空前增涨，日前塔斯社关于苏联已拥有原子武器的声明，表示着世界和平阵营力量的更为强大，战争挑拨者靠原子弹吓人又破产了。东欧人民民主国家正进一步巩固和壮大。资本主义各国的人民则正在争取和平的口号下动员、团结和组织起来。在中国，我们人民革命战争已经胜利，全国人民所热望的，中央人民政府已经成立，这是世界和平阵营的大胜利，是帝国主义侵略战争的大失败。中国四万万七千五百万人民的正式参加以苏联为首的和平阵营，这使得和平阵营的力量更加增强，使得侵略阵营的力量更加削弱了。中国人民为了进一步打击帝国主义侵略者，巩固和平民主阵营，将继续努力肃清国内反动派的残余力量，并用主要力量恢复与发展人民的经济与文化。同时，我们将在这个大会上成立中国保卫世界和平的全国委员会，以便更有计划有步骤地加强中国人民争取世界持久和平的工作，并与各国人民的和平民主运动建立更密切的联系。
    我们深信，只要各国爱好和平的人民提高警惕，继续加强斗争，紧紧团结在强大的和平堡垒苏联的周围，团结在人类伟大领袖斯大林的周围。战争冒险家的计划，一定会被打的粉碎；让世界拥护和平大会宣言中的号召变成全世界人民的一致行动，来回答战争贩子们的阴谋吧！“勇敢而有信心地为和平而斗争！”我们在这里要高呼：
    我们反对侵略战争！
    我们拥护世界和平！
    打倒战争挑拨者！
    世界和平阵营的强大支持者中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国人民的领袖毛泽东主席万岁！
    世界和平阵营的领导者苏联万岁！
    全世界劳动人民的伟大领袖和导师斯大林大元帅万岁！
    人民民主与持久和平万岁！
