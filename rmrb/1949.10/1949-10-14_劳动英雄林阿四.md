Labor Hero Lin Asi
    Textile Worker Yi Gen
    Lin Asi is a fifty-year-old worker in the material storage of the No. 1 Textile Factory. He is from Shanghai. When he was born, his family consulted a fortune teller, who said that his five elements lacked water, so he was named "Forest." Because he was the fourth child, everyone called him Lin Asi. Asi's childhood was spent in poverty. He attended school for only a year before his family could no longer afford the tuition. At the age of thirteen, he was fortunate enough to be introduced to a tailor shop as an apprentice. At sixteen, he became a worker in the coarse spinning maintenance department of the Japanese-owned Nei Wai Cotton No. 5 Factory, where he only wiped down machines and added oil every day. He worked diligently and studied attentively. Within a few years, he learned to repair machines. Later, he was transferred to work at the Nei Wai Cotton No. 5 Factory. For fifteen years, he lived in the factory, so he felt particularly close to everything in the factory, even a piece of wood!
    In 1931, Asi was introduced by a friend to the Nei Wai Cotton No. 1 Weaving Factory's maintenance department to manage machine materials. Asi initially found this new job very difficult. There were many types of machine materials, the names were complicated, and he didn't know many characters, so he faced difficulties everywhere. However, he was patient and willing to learn, and he was busy in the machine material storage all day long. When the workshop lacked parts, they would ask him for them. Asi would carefully check them out one by one and send them to them.
    After the end of the Anti-Japanese War, the Kuomintang reactionary government took over all enemy property in Shanghai. The Nei Wai Cotton No. 1 Weaving Factory was renamed the China Textile Construction Company No. 1 Textile Factory. Lin Asi did not leave and continued his old job, managing the machine materials in the North Warehouse. In April of this year, Asi heard a piece of news from somewhere that the Eighth Route Army was about to cross the Yangtze River and that workers would be completely emancipated once the Communist Party arrived in Shanghai. Asi was overjoyed and determined to carefully inventory all the materials in the warehouse. "I need to figure out what belongs to me," he thought, "otherwise, how can I be a master?" So Asi secretly began to work hard again.
    There were more than a thousand types of machine materials in the North Warehouse, including various parts used for the 1,008 cloth machines, ten warping machines, six cone winders, four sizing machines, and two quill winders in the North Weaving Department. At first, Asi was secretly busy organizing things alone. Later, two long-term worker colleagues saw him and were willing to cooperate with him. Asi was very happy. He said, "Let's first check the material accounts and card records against each other, then check each category one by one, large and small, and we will carefully count everything." Everyone agreed and decided to do it that way.
    "What about these countless small screws?" one colleague raised a difficulty.
    "Small screws must also be counted one by one," Asi replied affirmatively.
    The three people spent a whole month counting small screws, but the effort was not in vain. The machine materials in the North Warehouse, which used to be messy and disorganized, are now so neat and tidy. The four-layer wooden shelves are arranged in rows, and all kinds of parts, large and small, are secretly placed. In front of each type of part, there is a card labeled with the number in red ink, starting from A and ending at S, divided into a total of nineteen categories. The different parts under each category are further divided with Arabic numerals 1234. The date of when they were received and issued, and the final balance, are noted separately. Asi is very familiar with these machine materials. Without looking at the card records, he can accurately tell you: these parts belong to the cloth machine room and sizing room, and those parts belong to the cone winding room and weft yarn room. The row placed under the wooden shelf are the seldom-used velvet weaving pedals, and the frequently used parts are placed by hand, arranged in the middle of the wooden shelf.
    During this factory's inventory work, everyone thought that the handover of the warehouse would be difficult, but the North Warehouse managed by Lin Asi was completely cleared and handed over in less than half a day. Asi did not participate in the inventory or take responsibility for the handover, but he was very excited and led the inventory personnel to show them each of the thousand-plus machine materials. As a result, it was found that many materials were omitted from the inventory list. Everyone greatly praised Asi's loyal and responsible attitude of working hard to serve the people. Recently, he has been elected as the staff representative of the machine material storage.
    An ordinary old worker who has worked hard for thirty-five years is now standing before us again, becoming a labor hero!

　　劳动英雄林阿四
    中纺工人  一艮
    林阿四，是第一纺织厂机物料间的一个五十岁的老工人。他是上海人，一生下来，家里替他算了一个命，说是五行缺水，因此取名森林，又因为他是排行第四，大家就称呼他林阿四。阿四的童年，度着穷苦的岁月，念上一年书，就无力缴纳学费而失了学。十三岁那年好容易介绍到一个裁缝铺里去当学徒，十六岁时，在日商办的内外棉第五厂粗纺保全部当小工，每天只是揩车、加油。他一面认真工作，一面专心学习，不上几年，他学会了修车。后来又调到内外棉第五厂工作。前后十五年，他生活在工厂里，因此，他对工厂里所有的一切，哪怕是一木，都特别感觉亲切！
    民国二十年，阿四由朋友的介绍，进日商内外棉第一织布厂保全部保管机物料。阿四对这新工作起初十分吃力，机料的种类多，名称又复杂，自己识字不多，处处觉得困难，可是他耐心好肯学习，成天在机物料间忙着，车间里缺少零件，就得向他要，阿四一样样检出来，送到他们面前。
    抗战结束，国民党反动政府接收了所有上海的敌产，内外棉第一织布厂改称为中国纺织建设公司第一纺织厂，林阿四没有离开，依旧干他的老行当，管理着北仓库的机物料。今年四月里，阿四不知从哪里听来一个消息，说是八路军要渡长江，共产党一到上海，工人要大翻身了，阿四满肚子高兴，决心要把仓库里的物料仔细盘出一个清帐。“自己该些什么东西要弄清楚”，他想：“否则，当什么主人？”于是阿四又偷偷地忙起来了。
    北仓库的机物料，有一千多种，包括北织部一千零八台布机，十部络经机，六部筒子车，四部浆纱机，两部纾子车所应用的各种零件。先是阿四一个人偷偷地忙着整理，后来两个长日工同事见了，愿意跟他合作。阿四很高兴，他说：“我们先把物料帐和卡片记录轧对一下，然后逐类盘查，大大小小，一件件，我们要仔细清点。”大家同意，就决定这样做了。
    “这数不清的小螺丝钉怎么办？”一个同事提出了困难。
    “小螺丝钉，也得一个个数。”阿四肯定地回答。
    三个人点小螺丝钉，整整花了一个月的时间，但工夫不是白费的，北仓库的机物料，过去是拉杂凌乱，没有头绪，现在是那么整齐，四层的木架床，一列列接排着，大大小小，各式各样的零件，秘密地安放着，每一种零件的面前，标上一张卡片，用红墨水先编上字号，从Ａ字起到Ｓ止，一共分十九类，每一类下面的不同零件，再用阿拉伯字１２３４分下去，什么时候收进付出，最后结存多少，分别注明了日期。阿四对这些机料，已非常熟习，不用看卡片纪录，他会准确地告诉你：这些零件是属于布机间浆糊间的，那些零件是属于筒子间纡纱间的。这放在木架下面的一列，是不常用的织棉绒的踏脚，经常要动用的零件，则放在手头边，排列在木架的中间。
    这次一厂举行清点工作，大家以为仓库的移交是困难的，可是林阿四管理的北仓库，却不消半天工夫就完全点交清楚了，阿四并不参加清点，也不负移交责任，但是他非常兴奋，带领着清点人员把一千多样机物料，一件件点给他们看，结果查出有许多物资在清册上是遗漏了，大家对于阿四这样忠实负责，努力为人民服务的态度，十分赞扬。最近，他已当选了机物料间的职工代表。
    一个苦干了三十五年的平凡的老工人，今天，又站在我们的面前，成为劳动英雄了！
