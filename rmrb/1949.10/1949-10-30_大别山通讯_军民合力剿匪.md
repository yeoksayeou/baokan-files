　　Dabie Mountain Dispatch

　　Army and People Unite to Suppress Bandits

　　In early September, the People's Liberation Army entered the Dabie Mountains to suppress bandits and was warmly welcomed by the people wherever they went. On the evening of the 4th, people from all walks of life in Mapu Town, Jinzhai County, learned that a certain unit would pass through the town the next morning and discussed welcome plans overnight, making welcome slogans, and washing teapots and teacups in every household. The next morning, the streets were plastered with red and green slogans, red lanterns were hung at the doors of every house, and two to three thousand people, including families of soldiers, workers, students, and citizens, each holding a small flag, drumming and setting off firecrackers, gathered in the streets to welcome them. When the troops entered Dongxiang Ridge, an old grandmother surnamed Zhu, around seventy years old, picked up a pair of bamboo chopsticks with practice marks left by the soldiers after drinking tea, and disregarding the difficulty, chased after the soldiers to return the chopsticks to them. After the troops entered the mountains, they often crossed mountains and ridges to pursue and annihilate fleeing enemies. They were able to brave the rain and go on long-distance bandit suppression in the pitch-black night. They endured cold and heat, hunger and thirst, and some comrades even fainted from the heat because they couldn't find water to drink on the top of the mountain. They often crawled forward on rugged and unfamiliar mountain roads. Their shoes were torn, so they made their own straw sandals or simply walked barefoot on the sharp, rocky mountain roads. They were high in morale, fought hard, and fully demonstrated the heroic nature of the People's Army.

　　The people of the Dabie Mountains not only supported their army with full love, but also supported the army with positive actions. They built roads and bridges, and did transportation work. They knew that the army had come to save them, and they should take active actions. Only when the army and the people are of one mind and work together can they completely eliminate the bandits and live in peace forever. In addition to ensuring the completion of transportation tasks, some also reported information about the bandits, delivered letters and led the way, and stood guard and kept watch. There were heroic deeds in the Yejiaji area where the masses used four red-tasseled spears to force seven fully armed bandits to surrender their weapons.

　　The hard battles of the People's Liberation Army and the active support of the local people have achieved great victories in the suppression of bandits in the Dabie Mountains. They destroyed the "Hubei-Henan-Anhui People's Self-Defense Army Headquarters," the bandit gang's command center in the Dabie Mountains, annihilated more than 2,200 bandits, and captured major bandit leaders such as Wang Xian, the commander of the "Hubei-Henan-Anhui People's Self-Defense Army," Fan Xun, the first deputy commander and chief of staff, Yuan Chengying, the second deputy commander and commander of the first detachment and the fake Lihuang County magistrate, and Ma Junci, the chief of the staff office. People's governments were established in some areas, ensuring that people can live and work in peace and contentment.

　　A month ago, the mountain people who had suffered from the burning, killing, and looting by bandits and special agents often ate boiled pumpkin with clear water, without oil or salt, and were so hungry that their faces were yellow and swollen. Someone hugged the soldiers and cried, "Comrades, if you don't come again, we won't be able to survive!" Now things are better. The People's Liberation Army has brought them vitality. They can make bamboo goods and woodenware. They can send local products such as white hemp and tea to other places to exchange for various things they need. In the future, when all the bandits are completely eliminated, the Dabie Mountains will gradually become a prosperous Dabie Mountains.

### 大别山通讯  军民合力剿匪

    军民合力剿匪
    九月初，人民解放军进入大别山剿匪，所到之处，受到人民热烈欢迎。四日晚，山区金寨县麻埠镇各界人民，获悉某部次日上午要经过该镇，连夜讨论欢迎办法，赶制欢迎标语，各家洗刷茶壶茶杯。次日清晨，街上贴满红绿标语，家家门口挂起红灯，普遍设置茶案，军属、工人、学生、市民二三千人各执小旗，敲锣打鼓，放鞭炮，集结街头欢迎。当部队开入东乡岭时，一个姓朱的七十上下年纪的老奶奶，拾起刚才战士们坐下喝茶遗下的一双带练的竹筷子，不顾艰难的追上战士们把筷子还给他。部队入山后，经常翻山越岭，追歼逃敌。他们能在伸手不见五指的黑夜里，冒雨去长途奔剿。他们受冷受热，忍饥挨饿，甚至因在山顶上找不到水喝而有些同志竟热得昏了过去。他们往往是在崎岖而又不熟悉的山路上匐匍前进。他们鞋子破了，自己打草鞋穿或是就赤着脚走在碎石锋利的山路上。他们士气旺盛，艰苦奋战，充分表现了人民军队的英雄本色。
    大别山人民，不仅是以满心的热爱去拥护自己的军队，而是以积极的行动来支援军队，他们筑路修桥，做运输工作。他们知道军队是为了拯救他们而来的，更应该积极行动起来，只有军民同心合力，才能够彻底剿灭土匪，永过太平日子。他们除保证完成交通运输任务外，有的还报告匪情，送信带路，站岗放哨。叶家集一带群众竟有以四根红缨枪将七个全副武装的土匪，追逼得缴械投降的英勇事迹。
    人民解放军的艰苦作战，当地人民的积极支援，获得了大别山剿匪的巨大胜利。他们摧毁了大别山区残匪首脑械关“鄂豫皖人民自卫军总司令部”，全歼土匪二千二百余名，并活捉到主要匪首“鄂豫皖人民自卫军”总司令汪宪、第一副司令兼参谋长樊迅、第二副司令兼第一支队司令及伪立煌县长袁成英、参谋处长马君慈等。部分地区建立了人民政权，保障了人民的安居乐业。
    一个月以前，惨遭匪特烧杀抢劫的山区人民，在人民解放军未入山时，他们经常吃的是清水煮南瓜，无油无盐，饿得面黄肌肿，有人抱着战士哭诉说：“同志，你们再不来，我们就活不下去啦！”现在是好了，人民解放军给他们带来了生机，他们可以做竹货，做木器，他们可以把当地的土产，如白麻、茶叶等送到外地去换回他们所需要的各种东西。往后土匪全部被彻底剿灭，大别山便会逐渐变成富裕的大别山了。
