　　I Met General He Long

　　On the day the news of the peaceful liberation of Xinjiang reached Beijing, September 29th, I met General He Long. In his profound solidity and abundant spirit, I saw the glory of the Chinese people's great victory after thousands of hardships. He is already fifty-six years old this year, but hearing his loud voice, it seems as if he is only in his thirties or forties. He smiled and said to us, "Xinjiang has returned to the people, has it been published in the newspaper?" He is so concerned about the victory of the people in the Northwest. This victory was hard-won! Just three years ago, the mad enemy launched a large-scale invasion of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. The enemy's strength was absolutely superior, while our strength was in an inferior position. However, our heroic People's Liberation Army, in one year's time, leaped from defense to offense, and has developed to the stage where our army in the Northwest frequently reports victories and sweeps away the remnants of the enemy. When General He Long talked about the reasons why the victory of the People's Liberation War in the Northwest could be rapidly developed, he told the reporter:

　　Although the enemy's beastly hooves have almost trampled the entire border region, they have done everything possible to burn, kill, rob, and rape, destroying the abundant life of the people in the border region, but they cannot destroy the strong will of the people in the border region. They know what methods to use to deal with beasts. At this time, the people in the border region took up arms, launched a wide-ranging guerrilla war, attacked and harassed the enemy everywhere, blocked news, and powerfully cooperated with the field troops in combat. With high enthusiasm, they carried out support work for the front line, transporting ammunition, food, and various necessities to the front line day and night, and rescuing the wounded at the front line. In order to supply food to the front line, the people of Jin Sui carried out transportation work from the distant northern Jin and Taiyue. Although the people encountered natural disasters at the same time as bandit disasters, they did not slacken in the slightest in working to support the front line. This highly conscious enthusiasm for supporting the front is an important factor in the rapid victory of the revolutionary war in the Northwest.

　　When talking about the bravery and hardship of the commanders and fighters of the Northwest Field Army, General He Long said: At the beginning of the battle with the enemy, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Peng personally led the troops, seeking opportunities to annihilate the enemy from the dense enemy deployment. The commanders and fighters annihilated the enemy with a resolute, tenacious, brave, and selfless spirit of sacrifice. The soldiers carried explosives and rushed towards the enemy's bunkers, sparing no effort to seize victory. Such heroic deeds emerged one after another. This endless strength generated by a high degree of class consciousness enabled us to quickly repel the absolutely superior enemy and turn ourselves into an offensive. The poverty of manpower and material resources in the Northwest increased the troops' difficulties greatly. The troops sometimes had no food to eat and had to endure hunger all day long. In the desert areas, they often had no water to drink, but they endured all these hardships and never infringed on the interests of the masses, which further increased the people's love for their own army. The military and the people are always closely united. They also quickly learned to unite, transform, and win over captured soldiers to fight against the common enemy of the people with us, which became the main source of our troop replenishment. Naturally, the assistance given to the Northwest by the people and troops of the brotherly liberated areas in terms of manpower, material resources, and strategic and tactical coordination also played a great role in overcoming the difficulties of the Northwest battlefield.

　　Finally, General He Long said forcefully: The reason why the Northwest battlefield can achieve rapid victory is especially dependent on the wise leadership and personal command of Chairman Mao of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. During the most difficult days of the war, the Central Committee and Chairman Mao spent them with the soldiers and civilians of the border region, and personally led our struggle against the enemy, which gave us a guarantee that we could avoid any detours and quickly defeat the enemy.

　　Today, we have reached the border of Xinjiang. The vast areas of Xi'an, Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia have been liberated. According to today's news, the military and political authorities of Xinjiang announced their secession from the Guangzhou reactionary remnant government and their return to the people's democratic camp. The people in this vast newly liberated area, whether they are the Hui people, the Tibetan people, or the people of other ethnic groups, warmly welcome and assist the People's Liberation Army with high enthusiasm, and once the war there is over, they will help the People's Government with the same enthusiasm to restore social order and restore production. I believe that the entire Northwest will soon be completely liberated and will enter a construction stage. With the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, the efforts of the people with high political awareness who have been tempered in the war, and the strong foundation of the close unity of all ethnic groups, the Northwest will surely achieve brilliant achievements in construction.

### 我见到了贺龙将军

　　我见到了贺龙将军
    在九月二十九日新疆和平解放的消息传到北京的那一天，我见到了贺龙将军。在他厚重笃实和充沛着的饱满精神中，使我看到了中国人民经过千百次艰难困苦而获得伟大胜利的光辉。他今年已有五十六岁，然而听到他的响亮声音，却好象他只有三四十岁。他笑咪咪的对我们说：“新疆归向人民了，报上登载了吧？”他那样地关心着西北人民的胜利，这个胜利是好不容易取得的啊！还在三年前，疯狂的敌人大举进犯陕甘宁边区，敌人的兵力是绝对优势，而我们的兵力则处于劣势地位。但我英勇的人民解放军在一年的功夫，从防御一跃而转入进攻，一直发展到今天西北我军频传捷报扫荡敌人残余的阶段。当贺龙将军谈到了大西北的人民解放战争胜利之所以能迅速展开的原因时，他告诉记者说：
    敌人的兽蹄虽然差不多踏遍了整个边区，烧杀、抢劫、奸淫无所不用其极，破坏了边区人民的丰足生活，但他破坏不了边区人民坚强的意志，他们知道应该用什么方法来对待野兽。在这时边区人民拿起了武器，开展了广泛的游击战争，到处打击骚扰敌人，封锁消息，有力地配合野战部队作战。他们以高度的热忱，进行支援前线工作，不分昼夜地为前线运送弹药、食粮和各种必需品，到前线上去抢救伤员，为了供给前线的食粮，晋绥人民从辽远的晋北和太岳进行运输工作。虽然与匪灾同时，人民又遇着天灾，但他们丝毫没有松懈地为了支援前线而工作着。这种高度自觉的支前热忱，正是西北革命战争取得迅速胜利的重要因素。
    在讲到西北野战军指战员的英勇和艰苦时贺龙将军说：开始同敌人作战，彭副总司令亲自率领着部队，从密集的敌军布署中寻求歼敌机会，指战员们以坚决、顽强、勇敢、忘我的牺牲精神来歼灭敌人，战士们背着炸药冲向敌人的堡垒；不惜粉身碎骨夺取胜利，这种英雄事迹是层出不穷的，这种高度的阶级自觉所产生出来的无穷无尽的力量，使我们很快打退了绝对优势的敌人，并使自己转入了进攻。西北人力物力的穷困，增加了部队很大的困难。部队有时没饭吃，不得不成天的忍受着饥饿，在沙漠地带，还常常没有水吃，但是他们忍受着这一切困苦，从不因此而侵犯群众的利益，这就更增加了人民对自己军队的爱戴，军民永远是密切团结着的。他们并很快的学会了团结改造争取被俘士兵与我一块反对人民的共同敌人，这就成了我们兵员补充的主要来源。自然，各兄弟解放区的人民和部队在人力物力及战略战役配合上，所给予西北的援助，对于克服西北战场的困难也是起了极大作用的。
    最后，贺龙将军有力地说：西北战场所以能迅速取得胜利，特别是依靠了中共中央毛主席的英明领导和亲自指挥。在战争最艰苦的那些日子，中央和毛主席是与边区军民一块渡过的，并新自领导我们对敌人的斗争，这就使我们获得了保证，可以不走任何的弯路，而迅速的战胜了敌人。
    今天，我们已经打到了新疆的边境。西安、甘肃、青海、宁夏的广大地区，均获得了解放，今天消息，新疆军政当局宣布脱离广州反动残余政府。归向人民民主阵营。在这广大新解放区的人民，无论是回族人民藏族人民以及其他民族的人民，都以高度的热情欢迎和援助人民解放军，而当那里战争一经结束，他们即以同样的热情，帮助人民政府进行恢复社会秩序和恢复生产的工作。我相信，整个大西北很快即可获得全部解放，而转入一个建设阶段。我们有毛主席和中央人民政府的领导和从战争中所锻炼出来的具有高度政治觉悟的人民的努力，和各民族的亲密团结的坚强基础，西北在建设工作中必将迅速获得光辉成就。
