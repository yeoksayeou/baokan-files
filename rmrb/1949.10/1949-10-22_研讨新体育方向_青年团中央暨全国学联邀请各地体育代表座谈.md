Discussing New Directions in Sports
　　The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League and the All-China Students' Federation Invite Sports Representatives from Various Regions to a Symposium
　　[Our newspaper dispatch] The Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League and the All-China Students' Federation yesterday (21st) jointly invited sports representatives from various regions who have arrived in Beijing to a symposium on the direction, principles, and implementation steps of sports in the new China. In addition, Mu Zuoyun, the leader of the Chinese basketball team attending the World Student Games, reported on the state of sports in the Soviet Union. Representatives from various regions spoke enthusiastically, first reviewing the past state of sports in our country. Everyone unanimously criticized the past individualistic view of sports and the super-class idea of "sports for sports' sake," believing that this phenomenon objectively served a minority of people and should be transformed and overcome. Regarding the new direction of people's sports in the future, it was unanimously agreed that it should conform to the principles of national, scientific, and mass character of the new China's cultural and educational policies; its guiding principle should be to improve and maintain the people's health, cultivate the people's strong and decisive character, strengthen discipline and the collectivist spirit of unity and friendship, and serve the new China's production and construction and the consolidation of national defense. Speaking of the implementation steps, everyone hoped to quickly establish central and local sports leadership organizations to uniformly lead national sports activities. With the development of production and construction and national defense construction, strengthen the publicity and education of sports, so that the people recognize the importance of sports and increase their interest in sports. Each region should, according to its specific circumstances, launch voluntary labor or other methods to build sports fields and add sports equipment. With emphasis and step-by-step popularize sports to factories and rural areas, develop social sports, uniformly adjust sports work cadres, adjust them to remote areas of the country, so that sports activities can achieve balanced development throughout the country. Raise and cultivate sports cadres, send delegations to the Soviet Union and Eastern European new democratic countries to study, and suggest that local people's governments hold various sports meets seasonally and promote people's sports medals, etc. (Jin Feng)
