　　Young Pioneer Branch Secretary Gu Yancun
　　Wang Shengchuan, Lü Chengyi, Shuncheng Street Elementary School, 7th District
　　Gu Yancun is a fifteen-year-old farm boy, living in Louji Village, Hexi County, Shandong, close to the Yellow River. His second elder brother works in the People's Government, and his father is a peasant who works the land all year round. In 1946, he went to the Seventh Senior Elementary School in a nearby village, but because he hadn't been able to attend school in the past, he couldn't keep up with the class. However, he wasn't discouraged or impatient, studying hard every day, listening attentively in class, reviewing after class, and honestly asking classmates and teachers when he didn't understand. After a month, he caught up with the class. Once, he saw in the newspaper: "Good young people should join the People's Liberation Army." He thought: "Why do good young people have to join the People's Liberation Army?" After thinking about it, he realized that to do things for the people and serve the people, one must study hard, cultivate good thoughts, and actively help classmates progress, in order to become a good young person. His thinking quickly developed, and he became particularly active in both study and work. Therefore, he was democratically elected as the chairman of the student union by the whole school.

　　After being elected chairman, Gu Yancun was not proud at all, and worked and studied even harder. He often talked with each classmate. If a classmate made a mistake and was criticized by the teacher, he would definitely comfort the classmate in private, explain the reasons, until the classmate happily accepted his opinion. This spirit of serving his classmates earned him the love of all the teachers and students. Under his influence, the students all progressed quickly.

　　In 1947, the Chiang bandits on the east bank of the Yellow River, relying on the river's water, constantly strafed and shelled the farmers tilling the land on the opposite bank and the laborers repairing the dikes. For the safety of the students, the school moved to a village four miles away from the river. The chairman of the student union took the group leaders to allocate houses first. The village was small, and only twelve places were allocated. Apart from the kitchen and the school headquarters, each of the ten groups had one place, and the student union chairman's group was assigned a dirty cowshed. This dirty, smelly, and filthy room aroused complaints from the students in the group. When Gu Yancun had settled the students, everyone returned to the group and immediately questioned him: "Chairman! Look at the house you allocated. How can we study here? Why do the other groups live so well? Why did you make us live in a dirty cowshed?" Comrade Yancun said gently: "Comrades, this village is small, and only twelve houses were allocated. We should let the good houses be occupied by other groups. We all have hands and strength, and we can use our hands to remove the manure, sprinkle water, and install boards to study. Besides, the revolution has not yet been completely victorious, and the people have not completely eliminated the Chiang bandit gang, so it's not time to enjoy happiness yet. If it weren't for the reactionaries causing trouble today, we wouldn't be living in this house..." These words convinced all the students in the group, so Gu Yancun first took a shovel and a basket in his hands and worked with all the students in the group. In less than an hour, this dirty and smelly cowshed became a very good study room.

　　Comrade Yancun is still studying and working in this place. Through these years of training, he has become a very experienced person in leading students to progress. Because of his consistent active and enthusiastic work, and his fearlessness of difficulties, he has gloriously joined the Communist Party and serves as the branch secretary of the Young Pioneers in the school's Communist Youth League.

　　少先队支部书记顾延村
    七区顺城街小学王胜川  吕成仪
    顾延村是个十五岁的农家孩子，家住在山东河西县紧靠黄河的楼集村。二哥在人民政府工作，父亲是整年劳动的庄稼人。一九四六年他到附近村第七高级小学念书，因为过去不能进学校，跟不上班。可是他并不灰心，不着急，整天学习，上课用心听，下课就温习，不会就老实的问同学问老师，一个月后他的功课就跟上班了。有一次他看见报上登着：“好青年要参加解放军。”他就想：“为什么参加解放军要好青年，”思索的结果，使他知道给人民办事情，为人民服务，必须好好学习，锻炼好思想，积极帮助同学进步，变成一个好青年才行。他的思想很快的得到了开展，学习工作都格外积极。因此他被全校民主选为学生会主席。
    顾延村自被选为主席后，一点不骄傲，工作学习更前进了。他时常和每个同学进行谈话。如某一个同学犯了错误，受到老师的批评，他一定背地去安慰同学，讲明道理，直到这个同学愉快的接受了他的意见才算完。他这种为同学服务的精神，受到全体师生的爱戴。在他的影响下，同学们都进步得很快。
    一九四七年河东岸的蒋匪，仗着黄水，不时向对岸种地的农民及修堤的民夫　行扫射、炮轰。学校为了学生的安全，便转移到距河四里地的一个村子里。学生会主席带着各小组组长先去划房子，村子小，只划了十二处，除去伙房、校部外，十个小组一组一处，学生会主席这组分了一处脏牛栏。这座又脏又臭、污秽不堪的屋子，引起了小组同学的埋怨。当顾延村把同学安排好了，大家回到组里时，立即被同学质问：“主席！你看你划的房子，怎么学习？其他小组为什么住那么好，为什么叫咱们住在脏牛栏里？延村同学和气地说：同学们，这个村子小，只划了十二处房子，咱们应当让好房子给别组住，咱们都有双手，有力气，我们可以用手将粪弄出去，用水洒洒，按上板就能学习，再说革命还没有完全胜利，人民还没有完全把蒋匪帮消灭，所以还不到享福的时候，今天若不是反动派捣乱，咱们也不会住这房子……”这些话把全组同学说得心悦诚服，于是顾延村首先将锨和筐拿在手里和全组同学一齐干，不到一个钟头这个又脏又臭的牛栏，变成了很好的学习室。
    延村同学现在仍在这个地方，一面学习一面工作。这几年的锻炼，他已成了领导学生进步很有经验的人。由于他的工作一贯积极热情，不怕困难，已光荣的参加了共产党，并担任了学校青年团少先队的支部书记。
