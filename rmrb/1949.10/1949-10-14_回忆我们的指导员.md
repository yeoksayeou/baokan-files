　　Remembering Our Instructor
　　Zhang Ming
　　Last autumn, I was studying in the 7th Company of the 5th Detachment of the North China Military and Political University. Our instructor was Comrade Zhang Jian.

　　Comrade Zhang was a cadre who came from his hometown in Guangdong in 1936, traversing mountains and rivers, overcoming numerous obstacles and dangers, to reach Yan'an and join the revolution. In 1938, he entered the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University (the predecessor of the Military University), and for ten years since then, he has been diligently working in education. During these great ten years of combat, his life has been exceptionally rich. When he had free time, he would tell us stories of his battles during the eight-year War of Resistance and his experiences in the growth of the Military University.

　　He described the educational situation at that time, saying: "Everyone had a small wooden board, a tattered notebook, and a pencil stub. After the battle, we would put our backpacks on the hillside or under the shade of a tree, and the instructor would stand out from the ranks of combatants and start teaching; at the sound of gunfire, we would pack up our backpacks,整理everything, and become a combat team again." In this way, until the victory of the War of Resistance, he was closely linked to school life. The school grew stronger, and he also became stronger.

　　Our 5th Detachment was composed of young students who had only recently been liberated from the Central Plains. The students still had many ideological problems. For example, before entering the Military University, many students imagined that after graduating, they would become a commander or a political commissar. But after entering the Military University and seeing that the school was scattered in the thatched houses of the villagers, they became discouraged. Some students even doubted "this is the Military University." However, after hearing the instructor's stories about the growing combat history of the Military University and many heroic and vivid stories of defeating the Japanese devils, the doubts quickly disappeared.

　　Comrade Zhang's life was very simple. He wore coarse cloth and ate millet, just like the students.

　　When we first entered the school, a classmate once said to me: "The Communist Party is too poor. Look, the instructor has been in the revolution for more than ten years, and he is still an instructor, eating millet just like the students." Because of this, the instructor once said to us: "Making revolution is not to enjoy oneself, nor is it to raise one's own status. To seek enjoyment or status is not called revolution. If we follow some students' saying that revolution is to seek status and enjoy oneself, then that is completely wrong." Then, he explained to us: "Being an instructor is already taking no small responsibility for the people. In the old society, workers didn't work for capitalists their whole lives, and hired laborers didn't work for landlords their whole lives." According to him, he was not willing to do educational work before, but since recognizing the importance of education, he understood that revolutionary work is diverse, and lacking any part is not okay, so he settled down. He worked as a propaganda officer, a deputy instructor, and an instructor. Later, when there were few teachers in the school, he also taught classes. As he lectured for a long time, he developed a great interest in educational work. In addition, with the Party's cultivation of him, he slowly became a political teacher. For ten years, he has been not only an excellent instructor in our Military University, but also an outstanding teacher. Those who have heard him lecture have all said, "Teacher Zhang lectures well!"

　　Instructor Zhang has a tenacious character. He is very proficient in his instructor duties. His work efficiency is fast, accurate, and reliable, like a well-synchronized clock. He is the instructor of our team and also serves as a teacher for two companies. He has to grasp the students' ideological situation, report, conduct individual talks, and prepare lessons. His work is indeed very busy. But he does not become disorganized in the face of so much work. When the students do morning exercises, he does them with us; when the students hold discussions, he participates in them; during extracurricular activities, he either joins the students' activities or tells them stories of combat and production… In short, he rarely misses any of the students' collective activities.

　　He usually educates the students very patiently, always implementing the spirit of persuasive education. He is good at using praise and criticism to promote students' progress. In addition to conducting summaries at each teaching stage, pointing out the students' strengths and weaknesses in all aspects, he also routinely conducts small praises and criticisms concisely during evening roll call. Because his praise is practical and his criticism is appropriate, the students simply regard his praise and criticism as an indispensable part of life; if the instructor does not speak for two days, the students feel as if they have lost something.

### 回忆我们的指导员

　　回忆我们的指导员
    张铭
    去年秋天，我在华北军政大学五大队七中队学习。我们的指导员是张鉴同志。
    张指导员是一个远在一九三六年从他的家乡——广东，翻山涉水穿过了重重的阻碍和艰险到达延安参加革命的干部。一九三八年进入了抗大（军大前身），直到现在十年有零了，他一直辛勤地做着教育工作。在这伟大的十年的战斗中，他的生活是异常的丰富的，他空闲起来便给我们讲他在八年抗战中的战斗故事和军大成长的经历。
    他描述当时的教育情况说：“每个人有一个小木板，一个破烂本本，一支铅笔头，打完了仗，往那个山坡上或者树荫下把背包一放，教员便从战斗的行列里站出来，上起课来了；一听见枪声，背包一背，东西一整理，就又变成了一个战斗队。”就这样，直到抗日胜利，他紧紧地与学校生活在一块，学校壮大了，他也坚强起来了。
    我们五大队都是才从中原解放不久的青年学生，同学们仍存在着不少思想上的毛病。譬如在入军大前，有很多同学幻想着军大毕业后，就可以当一个司令员或者政治委员，但入军大后，看到军大校址零乱的分散在各村庄老乡家的草屋里，便灰心了，甚至有些同学怀疑“这不是军大”，但是，在听了指导员关于军大壮大的战斗史和许多英勇生动的打败日本鬼子的故事后，疑虑就很快没有了。
    张指导员的生活很朴素，穿粗布、吃小米，完全与同学们一样。
    在我们刚入校之际，有个同学曾会向我说过：“共产党太苦了，你看，指导员革命十来年啦，还不是当个指导员，和同学们一样吃小米。”为此，指导员曾向我们说：“闹革命不是来闹享受，也不是用来抬高自己的地位。闹享受、闹地位，那就不叫革命了。假若照某些同学的说法：革命是来闹地位闹享受的话，那就完全错了。”随后，他又向我们解释说：“干个指导员，已经为人民负了不小的责任，在旧社会里工人还不是替资本家作一辈子工，雇工还不是给地主家扛一辈子活。”据他自己说，他以前并不乐意做教育工作，但自从认识了教育的主要性后，他明白了革命工作是多样性的，缺少任何一项，也是不行的，于是他安定下来了。他作宣教干事、作副指导员，作指导员，以后，学校教员少，他又附带着教课，讲的时间长了，他对教育工作，竟引起了很大的兴趣，加之党对他的培养，慢慢地，他又成为一个政治教员了。十年来，他在我们军大，不但是一个优秀的指导员，同时也是一个出色的教员。听过他讲课的同志，没有不说“张教员讲得好！”
    　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　×
    张指导员，有着坚韧的性格。他的指导员的业务非常熟练。工作效率，又迅速，又确实，就象合拍的时钟一样。他是我们队上的指导员，又兼任两个中队上的教员，他要掌握队上学员的思想情况、汇报，个别谈话，准备功课，他的工作的确是够忙的。但他在这样众多的工作面前没有紊乱的现象。同学们出早操，他跟着出早操；同学们开讨论会，他参加讨论会；课外活动时，他不是加入同学们的活动，就是和同学们讲战斗生产的故事。……总之：凡是同学们的集体活动，他是很少不参加的。
    他平常教育同学很耐心，总是贯彻着说服教育的精神，他善于利用表扬和批评推动同学们进步，除了每个教学阶段，进行总结。指出同学们各方面的优缺点外，他又照常在晚上点名时间，突出扼要地进行小的表扬和批评。由于他表扬得实际，批评得恰当，同学们对于他的表扬和批评简直成了一种生活上不可缺少的东西；如果隔两天指导员不讲话，同学们便感觉好象遗失了什么东西似的。
