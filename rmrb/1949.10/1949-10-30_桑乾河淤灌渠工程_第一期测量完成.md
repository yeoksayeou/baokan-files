　　Sanggan River Silt Irrigation Canal Project –
　　First Phase of Survey Completed

　　[From Our Newspaper] The Chahar Sanggan River First Silt Irrigation Canal Project Team, jointly formed by the North China Ministry of Agriculture Water Conservancy Project Team and the Chahar Water Conservancy Bureau, departed on September 27th, passed through Datong to Shanyin County, and began surveying on October 2nd. By October 16th, the surveying of over 80 kilometers of the main and branch canals had been completed. Within the silt irrigation area north of the Huangshui River and south of the Sanggan River, 320,000 mu of land can be entirely silt-irrigated by three branch canals. Funds are now being allocated and materials are being prepared for construction to ensure successful completion by next summer. An average increase of 90 jin of grain per mu per year can increase production by more than 28.8 million jin. The second phase of the survey, covering 260,000 mu, is also underway.
