　　Qinghe Woolen Mill
    Preliminary Experience of Implementing "Piece-Rate Wage System"
    Lu Lai
    After liberation, the Qinghe Woolen Mill implemented a "time-based wage system," while the old wage grades remained unchanged, which hindered the restoration and development of the factory's production. Therefore, the factory leadership decided to start with the cotton weaving department in August to pilot the "piece-rate wage system" to gain experience and promote it throughout the factory, to effectively utilize mechanical efficiency, rationally organize labor, and improve output and quality.
    The cotton weaving department of the factory has ten electric looms and seventeen wooden looms. The standard output is determined as follows: For the electric looms, the hourly efficiency of each machine is multiplied by the daily working hours to obtain the daily theoretical output, and then multiplied by 60% (i.e., deducting time for shuttle change, thread splicing, minor repairs, short breaks, and the difference in actual mechanical efficiency, etc.). For the wooden looms, the standard is determined by the average labor intensity of the workers in conjunction with the actual mechanical efficiency. Each worker looks after two electric looms, and the monthly standard output is 42 bolts (each bolt is 40 yards long) of white cloth. Each worker operates one wooden loom, and the monthly standard output is 11.9 bolts of white cloth. The determination of these two standards was referenced and compared with other cotton weaving factories in the city, and was finalized after being agreed upon by the workers and approved by the administration.
    The calculation of the price per bolt is derived by dividing the monthly wage of a second-grade, second-level weaving worker, which is 363.3 catties of corn, by the monthly standard output: 8.65 catties of corn per bolt for electric looms and 30.5 catties of corn per bolt for wooden looms. Within the standard output, workers are paid by the piece; for the number of bolts exceeding the standard output, the payment is progressively increased at a rate of 1.1557 catties of corn per bolt.
    During downtime due to work stoppage waiting for materials, major repairs, or power outages, each person is paid half of their base salary for the downtime. Although the grades of the workers in the department were adjusted in September through live assessment, divided into second-grade, first-level, second-grade, second-level, second-grade, third-level, and second-grade, fourth-level, the base salaries of each grade remained unchanged, with differences between the grades from top to bottom being: 18, 30, 17 (unit: corn), which is unreasonable. After the factory implemented the "piece-rate system" in August, it basically achieved results. For example, the output in July was only 405 bolts of white cloth. In August, it increased to 669 bolts of white cloth. In September, it further increased to 779 bolts of white cloth, and also produced 1467 yards of colored striped cloth. In terms of labor organization, the factory administration had repeatedly attempted to streamline personnel, but after five or six meetings, they could not find a way to do so. After the implementation of the "piece-rate system," the workers spontaneously offered opinions, pointing out which departments had too many people and which departments should be strengthened. The cotton weaving department originally had 102 workers in July. In August, it was reduced to 91, and by September, the workers proposed that only 81 workers were needed for the original number of machines. This naturally reduces costs. The effect of encouraging workers to improve their skills is also significant. For example, when the workers saw that Nie Kun, a wooden loom worker, had good skills and worked diligently, and his output in September reached 640 yards of white cloth, earning a wage of more than 470 catties of corn, and also received a quality bonus of 10% of his base salary. Therefore, the workers felt that improving their skills and working diligently was the right direction to strive for. It also played a certain role in consolidating production enthusiasm and improving workers' lives.
    However, the factory made a mistake in the area of quality. On August 11, the first batch of 300 bolts of white cloth produced after the implementation of the piece-rate system were transported to the trading company to exchange for yarn, of which 202 bolts were rejected due to non-compliance with specifications. The main reason for this serious deviation was that the factory leadership did not pay enough attention to quality standards in their thinking. They did not set clear quality specifications in advance and lacked timely attention after the implementation of the piece-rate system. As a result, the inspection system was not strict enough, and the old inspectors, out of consideration for personal relationships, were perfunctory in inspecting the finished products. At the same time, the explanation and education work for the staff was not thorough enough before the piece-rate system, and the workers' understanding of the piece-rate system was not improved politically, so as to break the workers' economic view of valuing quantity over quality. The factory leadership accepted this painful lesson, and on the one hand, conducted self-criticism and work inspection, and on the other hand, started to educate the staff ideologically in the worker groups, explaining that the "piece-rate system" is a concrete way to implement "taking into account both public and private interests" and "developing production," and is a true manifestation of workers being the masters of their own affairs. After nearly half a month of research and deliberation, by the beginning of September, the finished product grade specifications of the cotton weaving department were formulated, stipulating the specifications of first, second, and third-grade products from the aspects of injury holes, jump weft, missing warp, oil stains, density, and broken edges as the criteria for inspecting finished products and awarding and punishing. In addition, specific rewards and punishments were formulated and the inspection mechanism was improved.
    After the quality grade specifications and rewards and punishments were formulated, the quality of finished products in September made great progress. Among the 31,960 yards of white cloth finished products, the second-grade products accounted for 150 yards. The third-grade products accounted for 107 yards. The rest were all first-grade products.
    In the process of inspecting finished products, the department changed the individual piece-rate system for yarn-making workers by bundle (each bundle is 20 yards) to a chain piece-rate system with weaving workers, that is, the actual output of weaving workers each month is used as the piece-rate output of yarn-making workers. The more the weaving workers produce, the higher the wages of the yarn-making workers. Conversely, it will decrease accordingly, the purpose is to prevent the yarn-making workers from being careless and rushing to work, thus hindering the production of the weaving workers. And this can eliminate the semi-finished product inspection procedures for yarn-making workers. But this method encountered difficulties in the specific implementation. For example, when the weaving machine malfunctions, or the yarn-making workers encounter a batch of bad yarn, the shutdown of the weaving machine and the increase of temporary workers by yarn-making workers. Both of these situations cause the wages of yarn-making workers to be unreasonably reduced. After accepting this experience, the department immediately re-adopted the piece-rate system for yarn-making workers by bundle, and implemented a semi-finished product inspection system.
    A preliminary summary of the Qinghe Woolen Mill's experience in piloting the "piece-rate wage system": (1) The "piece-rate wage system" is a progressive wage system that can play an active role in promoting the improvement of output and quality, the rationalization of production organization, and the consolidation of production enthusiasm. (2) To pilot the "piece-rate wage system," the primary task is to grasp the quality and output standards of finished and semi-finished products, strictly implement the inspection system of finished and semi-finished products, and all specifications must be clearly stipulated, and the old inspection mechanism must be transformed. (3) It is an indispensable task to conduct an explanation of the "piece-rate system" to the workers in advance, and to cooperate with political ideological education. (4) Establishing a reward and punishment system is complementary to strict quality standards. Otherwise, it is difficult to inspire the production enthusiasm of employees. (5) Individual responsibility should be implemented as much as possible, and yarn-making workers and weaving workers, or other similar situations, should not be held jointly responsible. A semi-finished product inspection system must be implemented.
    Several urgent problems to be solved now: (1) Output standard problem: The factory's piece-rate output standard is determined by multiplying the theoretical output by 60%. However, the reason for multiplying by 60% is based on an abstract estimate of the workers' working hours. The lack of precise scientific calculation makes it difficult to prove whether the standard output is appropriate. Therefore, in this regard, the factory urgently needs to use the method of calculating the labor time of each production process in seconds to scientifically correct the output standard and correctly implement the progressive piece-rate system for overproduction. (2) Wage grade problem: The difference between the piece-rate wage grades in the factory is 18, 30, and 17 (unit: corn) from top to bottom. The difference is too small, and the arrangement of the difference is small at the top, small at the bottom, and large in the middle. Both of these aspects are unreasonable. This needs to be studied and steadily improved by the factory. (3) Reward and punishment measures: In the factory's piece-rate reward measures, one regulation stipulates that the one with the most overproduction is also one of the conditions for winning the award, which is unreasonable. Because overproduction has a progressive piece-rate method to encourage it, the reward measures should focus on quality and love for machines and conservation.

　　清河制呢厂　
    试行“计件工资制”的初步经验
    鲁赖
    解放后，清河制呢厂实行“计时工资制”，而旧的工资等级，仍然保持原状，这对于该厂生产的恢复和发展，是有阻碍的。因之，该厂领导上，决定从八月份起，先从棉织部试行“计件工资制”，以便吸取经验，推行全厂，达到有效的利用机械效能，合理组织劳动力，提高产量和质量的目的。
    该厂棉织部有电机十台，木机十七台。标准产量的订定是：电机部分以每台机器每小时效能，乘每日工时，所得到的每日理论产量，再打六折（即减去换梭、接线、小修、小憩及机械实际效能的差额等时间）。木机则是以人力的平均劳动强度，配合机械的实际效能来订定；电线每人看二台，每月的标准产量是四十二匹（每匹长四十码）白布。木机每人一台，每月的标准产量是十一·九匹白布，这两种标准产量的订定，均曾与本市其它各棉织厂参照比较，经工人同意，行政批准，才确定的。
    每匹单价的计算，是由原订二等二级织布工每月工资三六三·三斤玉米，除以每月标准产量得出来的：电机每匹单价八·六五斤玉米，木机每匹单价三○·五斤玉米。在标准产量以内的，按件计资；超过标准产量的匹数，累进计资，每匹的累进等比一·一五五七斤玉米。
    在停工待料、大修、或停电等时间内，每人发给停工时间底薪的一半。该部工人的等级，虽曾于九月份，考活调整。共分为二等一级，二等二级，二等三级，二等四级。但各等级的底薪，仍然未动，等级间的差额，由上而下为：十八，三○，十七（单位玉米），这是不合理的。该厂在八月份试行“计件制”后，基本上是有成绩的。比如在七月份产量仅达四○五匹白布。八月份即增产至六百六十九匹白布。九月份又增至七百七十九匹白布，另外还出品了花条布一四六七码。在劳动组织上，该厂行政上，曾数度企图精简人员，但开了五六次会，都无从下手，在实行“计件制”后，工人自动的提出了意见，指出那些部门的人过多，那些部门应该加强。棉织部七月份原有工人一○二人。八月份即减至九十一人，到九月份，工人提出就原有机数，只须八十一人就够了。这样成本自然就要降低。在鼓励工人提高技术方面，功效也很显著。比如一般工友见到木机工人聂昆，技术好、认真干，九月份产量达六四○码白布，得到工资四百七十余斤玉米，并获到质量优良奖金底薪百分之十。因之，工人都感到提高技术、认真工作，是一个正确的努力方向。其它如在巩固生产热情，改善工人生活等方面，也都起了一定的作用。
    但是，在质量方面，该厂是犯了偏向的，在八月十一日，该厂计件后第一批出品白布三百匹，运到贸易公司去换纱，其中竟有二○二匹，因不合规格而被退回。造成这一严重偏向的主要原因，在于该厂领导思想上，对质量标准不够重视，事前既没订出明确的质量规格，计件后“又缺乏及时的注意。因之，检验制度不够严密，而旧的检验员，又碍情面，对成品检验马虎过去。同时在计件前，对职工的解释教育工作，做得不够深入，没有从政治上提高工人对计件制的认识，以打破工人重量不重质的经济观点。该厂领导上接受了这一惨痛的经验教训，一方面进行了自我检讨和工作检查，另方面便在工人小组间，着手从思想上教育职工，说明“计件制”，是实行“公私兼顾”、“发展生产”的具体办法，也就是工人当家的真实表现。经过近半月的研究和酝酿，至九月初，即订出了棉织部成品等级规格，从伤孔、跳纬、漏经、油污、密度、破边等方面，订出了一、二、三等品的规格，作为检验成品和奖惩的准绳。另外并具体订出了奖惩办法。健全了检验机构。
    质量等级规格和奖惩办法订出后，九月份的成品质量，有很大的进步。在三万一千九百六十码的白布成品中，二等品连占一五○码。三等品占一○七码。其余均为一等品。
    在检验成品过程中，该部曾将打纱工的个人按捆（每捆二十码）计资制，改变为与织布工连环计资，即以织布工每月的实际产量，作为打纱工的计资产量，织布工产量增多，则打纱工的工资也愈高。反之，就随之减少，目的在于防止打纱工的马虎赶活，因而妨碍了织布工的生产。并可以此免去打纱工的半成品检验手续。但这办法在具体的实施中，遇到了困难。例如当织机发生故障，或打纱工碰上一批坏纱，织机的停工和打纱工的增加临时工。这两种情况都使打纱工的工资时遭到不合理的降低。该部接受此一经验后，立即重新采用打纱工的以捆计资制，并实行半成品的检验制度。
    初步总结该厂试行“计件工资制”的经验：（一）“计件工资制”是一个进步的工资制度，它对于产量和质量的提高，生产组织的合理化，和生产热情的巩固，是能够起积极的推动作用的。（二）试行“计件工资制”，首要的在于掌握成品及半成品的质量和产量标准，严格的执行成品及半成品的检验制度，各项规格，均须明确规定，对旧的检验机构，必须加以改造。（三）事先对工人进行“计件制”的解释，并配合政治的思想教育，是必不可少的一件工作。（四）建立奖惩制度是与严格质量标准，互为配合的。否则是难于启发职工的生产积极性的。（五）应该尽量实行个人负责，不可将打纱工与织布工，或其它类似情况连环负责。必须实行半成品检验制度。
    现在的几个急待解决的问题：（一）产量标准问题：该厂的计件产量标准，是以理论产量打六折而订定的。但是，打六折的理由，却是以对工人劳动时间的抽象估计为根据。缺乏精密的科学计算，这就很难证实标准产量是否恰当。所以，在这方面，该厂急须进行以秒计算生产过程各项劳动时间的方法，科学的订正产量标准，正确执行超产累进计资制度。（二）工资等级问题：该厂计件制工资等级间的差额，由上而下为：十八、三十、十七（单位玉米）。差额过小，差额的排列上小，下小，中间大。这两方面都是不合理的。这是有待该厂研究后，稳步改善的。（三）奖惩办法：在该厂计件制奖励办法中，有一项规定，超产最多者，亦为得奖条件之一，这是不合理的。因为超产有累进计资的方法，加以鼓励，奖励办法应该着重于质量及爱护机器节约等重点上。
