Objectives of the National Front of Democratic Germany

　　In recent months, all parts of our country have been discussing the lofty goals of the National Front of Democratic Germany. In view of the wishes of people from all walks of life, the German People's Council considers it necessary to announce concisely and clearly the purpose of the National Front of Democratic Germany:

　　　　Unification of Germany

　　(1) To abolish the divided West German state, abolish the Ruhr Statute, abolish the autonomy of the Saar, and establish an all-German government of the German Democratic Republic, thereby restoring Germany's political and economic unity.

　　　　Peace Treaty

　　(2) To conclude a just peace treaty with Germany as soon as possible. After the signing of the peace treaty, all occupying forces will withdraw within a clearly defined short period.

　　(3) To fully and unconditionally recognize the Potsdam decisions on the democratization and demilitarization of Germany, and to recognize Germany's obligations to other countries as stipulated in these decisions.

　　　　Sovereignty

　　(4) To restore Germany's full sovereignty, including the right to an independent foreign policy and independent foreign trade.

　　After the conclusion of the peace treaty, the free and independent development of the German Democratic State and the German people.

　　　　Against Warmongers and Splitters

　　(5) To conduct an irreconcilable and active struggle against Germany's new instigators of war. To prohibit war propaganda in newspapers, radio, and gatherings.

　　To conduct an irreconcilable struggle against Germany's joining aggressive military blocs, the European Union, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

　　(6) To conduct a relentless and active struggle against the German traitors—the agents of American imperialism in Germany, the culprits who advocate splitting Germany and enslaving its western regions. To fight against state separatists and splitters who support the imperialist policy of dismembering Germany.

　　(7) To fully and unconditionally support the forces fighting for world peace, equality, and friendship throughout the world. Germany cooperates and maintains friendly relations with all peace-loving nations and countries that recognize the national interests of Democratic Germany.

　　　　Berlin—Capital of Germany

　　(8) To immediately restore unity and normalize life in Berlin, the capital of Germany.

　　　　Planned Recovery

　　(9) To use a unified currency throughout Germany. Trade and economic cooperation should not be hindered. Free movement of people and free flow of goods between the German states and regions.

　　(10) To immediately stop foreign capitalists from enslaving the German economy. Foreign loans can only be accepted on the condition that they do not interfere in Germany's internal affairs and that the German authorities have the right to freely use such loans.

　　(11) To immediately stop dismantling factories and other measures aimed at restricting and stifling Germany's peaceful economy.

　　(12) To remove all restrictions imposed by Western countries on Germany's foreign trade for the sake of competition. To encourage Germany's trade with the Soviet Union and Eastern and Southeastern European countries, which are Germany's natural trading partners. To eliminate obstacles in the development of Germany's peaceful industry and merchant shipbuilding industry.

　　(13) To enact laws to protect the German national economy and private property.

　　(14) To raise the living standards of the German people by developing industry and commerce, to systematically abolish the rationing system, and to eliminate unemployment.

　　(15) To increase agricultural productivity, help poor farmers, and fairly distribute land to farmers and new immigrants from all over Germany.

　　(16) To provide housing and jobs for new immigrants in various regions. To rebuild destroyed towns and villages.

　　　　Equality

　　(17) All German citizens, regardless of their class, political views, and religious beliefs, are equal before the law.

　　　　Develop Culture

　　(18) Freedom of the press, freedom of broadcasting, and freedom of film. Stop the censorship practiced by the British and Americans.

　　(19) To take effective measures to safeguard and develop German technical, scientific, literary, and artistic research. To improve the status of intellectuals throughout Germany.

　　(20) To promote close cultural ties between the German regions, free from any external interference or restrictions.

　　To ensure the victory of the struggle to achieve these goals, the National Front of Democratic Germany specifically defines its task as: supporting any possible forms of cooperation among patriotic forces in the political and cultural fields, and in financial, commercial, and other economic matters. The more flexible the working methods and approaches of the National Front, the richer its work content, and the sooner the great goal of German unification will be realized.

　　The National Front of Democratic Germany has begun to develop into a powerful force. We call on all workers, staff, peasants, technicians, scientists and artists, national youth, patriotic employers, every German woman, and all Germans, regardless of their political views and party affiliation, to stand up and support the goals of the National Front, regardless of their political and social status, and regardless of their personal worldview, all may request to join the National Front of Democratic Germany. In the face of national disaster, it is first and foremost necessary to ensure the militant cooperation between all upright patriots who demand peace, unity, and freedom for the motherland.

　　German men and women! German youth! In accordance with the Third German People's Congress, the German Democratic Republic has been unanimously approved for establishment by the parties and mass organizations within the German People's Council in Berlin, the capital of Germany. The German provisional government established in accordance with the constitution will take the struggle for peace, unity, and sovereignty of Germany as its main task.

　　This government will become a powerful fortress for the struggle to implement the program of the National Front of Democratic Germany.

　　We call on the German people to recognize the current dangers and the possibilities for self-defense.

　　We call on the German people to take on the responsibility of saving the country, and to pave the way for peace, for the establishment of a unified German Democratic Republic, and for national liberation by supporting the struggle of the Democratic United National Front!

　　Long live the National Front of Democratic Germany!
