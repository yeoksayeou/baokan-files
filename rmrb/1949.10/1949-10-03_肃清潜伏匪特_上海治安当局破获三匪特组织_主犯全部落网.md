　　Eliminating Hidden Bandits and Special Agents
    Shanghai Security Authorities
    Crack Three Bandit-Agent Organizations
    All Masterminds Apprehended
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 29th] The Shanghai Municipal Security Authorities recently cracked three more special agent organizations: the Chiang Kai-shek Ching-kuo system's "Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Special Strike Dare-to-Die Corps," the bandit Kuomintang military intelligence system's "National Revolutionary Anti-Communist Salvation Army," and the bandit Ministry of National Defense's Second Bureau special agent organization. All masterminds have been apprehended. The bandit "Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Special Strike Dare-to-Die Corps" was internally divided into action departments such as special strike, demolition, and law enforcement, as well as publicity and intelligence agencies, and had planned to carry out various terrorist methods and assassination plots. After the Municipal Public Security Bureau obtained intelligence, it wiped out the "Special Strike Dare-to-Die Corps" in one fell swoop. A total of more than 20 bandits were captured, including the bandit chief and deputy commander Chen Yuqing, chief of staff Wang Jinhai, detachment leaders Zhou Mengrong and Wei Rushan, deputy detachment leaders Jia Jinchan and Sun Chunrong, and various bandit official seals, stamps, documents, rosters, weapons, and ammunition were seized. The "National Revolutionary Anti-Communist Salvation Army" was organized and led by Wu Zibin, supervisor of the bandit traffic police corps. After the liberation of Shanghai, it remained hidden in the city to continue carrying out counter-revolutionary sabotage activities, and contacted Zang Manya, the captain of the bandit "Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army" (an armed special agent force belonging to the military intelligence system), and An Jianping, the head of armed bandits and special agents in western Zhejiang, to organize a bandit military headquarters in the Pudong, western Zhejiang, and Hang (zhou)-Jia (xing)-Hu (zhou) areas. Recently, special agent leaders from various places came to Shanghai to discuss and arrange sabotage activities. After investigation by the People's Public Security Bureau, the main culprits Wu Zibin, Zang Manya, and dozens of others were all arrested. In addition, the Shanghai Municipal People's Public Security Bureau recently also arrested Jiao Jianhe, the station chief of the bandit Ministry of National Defense's Second Bureau special agent organization Shanghai station, Chen Ping and others, the radio station chiefs, and also seized radio stations, pistols, and many important documents.
