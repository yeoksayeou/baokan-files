　　Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 5th: Berlin Dispatch: The Socialist Unity Party of Germany recently sent a telegram to Chairman Mao with congratulations. The full text is as follows:

　　To Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Communist Party of China:

　　On the occasion of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference establishing the People's Republic of China, we extend our warmest congratulations to you and all the Chinese people. Progressive Germans have always followed with deep admiration and sympathy the selfless and arduous struggle of the Chinese people over the past decades to liberate their motherland from the rule of foreign oppressors, headed by US imperialism, and the Chiang Kai-shek puppet government. The victory achieved by the united front of the entire Chinese people under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party of China will occupy a glorious place in human history. This victory was won by the heroic achievements of the best sons and daughters of China, and the proclamation of the People's Republic of China consolidated this victory. All people who are still under the yoke of imperialism, as well as the German people who have been placed under colonial rule by British and American imperialists and domestic traitors, will, like the Chinese people, resolutely unite all their forces, strengthen their ties with the great socialist Soviet Union and other freedom-loving people, and victoriously complete the struggle for national liberation, regardless of any obstacles. The Socialist Unity Party of Germany is willing to promote the establishment of solid friendship between countries, and wishes the Chinese people to liberate every last inch of their country in the near future.

　　Long live international friendship!

　　Long live friendship with the Soviet Union!

　　Long live the independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, and strong People's Republic of China!

　　Long live the Communist Party of China, the leader of the Chinese national democratic united front!

　　Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany
