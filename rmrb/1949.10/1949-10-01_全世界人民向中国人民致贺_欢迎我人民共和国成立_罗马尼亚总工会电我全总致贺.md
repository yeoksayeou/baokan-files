　　People Around the World Congratulate the Chinese People, Welcoming the Founding of Our People's Republic
Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 30th. The Romanian General Confederation of Labor sent a telegram to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, congratulating the founding of the People's Republic of China. The telegram is as follows:

    To the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Beijing:

    On the occasion of the proclamation of the People's Republic of China, we, on behalf of the workers, staff, and engineers of the People's Republic of Romania organized in the General Confederation of Labor, extend our warm congratulations to the heroic Chinese people. We watch the arduous battles and glorious victories of the People's Liberation Army with boundless admiration, and we wish you complete victory in crushing the remnants of the Kuomintang, the despicable servants of Anglo-American imperialism, under the leadership of the heroic Chinese Communist Party and its fearless leaders. The People's Republic of China will be an important member of the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism, headed by the great, invincible fortress of peace, freedom, and national independence—the Soviet Union.

    Long live the People's Republic of China!

    Long live the heroic Chinese Communist Party, the leader of the struggle for freedom and against imperialist aggressors!

    Long live the world democratic and socialist front headed by the great country led by Joseph V. Stalin, the teacher and friend of all working people in the world—the victorious socialist Soviet Union!

    　　　　　　　　　　　　　People's Republic of Romania

    　　　　　　　　　　　　　Chairman of the Central Committee of the General Confederation of Labor, Apostol

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 30th. The Polish United Workers' Party's organ, *People's Tribune*, published an editorial on September 23rd entitled "The People's Republic of China," the full text of which is as follows:

    "'We announce the founding of the People's Republic of China'"—Comrade Mao Zedong, the leader of the victorious Chinese people, used these words to proclaim the establishment of a new people's state.

    The proclamation of the People's Republic of China is the result of decades of struggle, in which the Chinese people shed a great deal of blood—the struggle for their liberation. The Chinese people fought against their own reactionaries and powerful foreign aggressors, against the conspiracies of imperialist countries. After many victories and defeats, after unprecedented sacrifices, the people finally won their glorious victory. The Chinese people achieved this victory primarily because they have always been led by the working class under the leadership of the fearless, unyielding Communist Party. From the correct theory of Marxism-Leninism, from the lessons of the great socialist October Revolution, from the experience of the advanced revolutionary party, and from their own experience in the Chinese revolutionary movement, this powerful arsenal of revolutionary will, policy, and strategy grew up, and guaranteed the victory of the Chinese Communist Party and the heroic Chinese people in their long struggle.

    The United States' billions of dollars and massive imports of weapons, tanks, aircraft, and ammunition were of no avail, nor were the opinions and assistance of American staff officers—even direct American military intervention was ineffective. For three years, the Chinese People's Army has gone from one victory to another, until the decadent and bribery-ridden, despicable, and vile Kuomintang government—the traitorous government of this agency of foreign imperialism—completely collapsed.

    Four hundred million Chinese stand in the ranks of free countries. The People's Political Consultative Conference, convened in the ancient capital of Beiping, is now laying the foundation for a new, truly free, and independent China. At the same time, the People's Army is wiping out the remnants of the Kuomintang army and liberating other parts of China. The area where the Kuomintang regime still exists in form is shrinking day by day. We say "in form" because this despicable agency of imperialism is, in fact, no longer able to exercise its functions.

    Comrade Mao Zedong said at the Beiping Consultative Conference: "Our nation will henceforth join the great family of all peace-loving and freedom-loving nations in the world." "Internationally, we must unite with all peace-loving and freedom-loving countries and peoples, especially with the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries." These words clearly and concisely point out the role and position of the People's Republic of China in the great struggle for peace and socialism that is taking place around the world today.

    Although the Anglo-American imperialists have suffered a crushing defeat in China, they will still try to play the China card in international policy. On the United Nations stage, they still use the Kuomintang government, and even use Chiang Kai-shek, to put together their "Pacific Pact"; the U.S. Congress is still passing loans to "help" this government. All of this is, of course, a hopeless attempt to challenge the Chinese people on the one hand, and to deceive public opinion at home and abroad on the other.

    The failure of imperialism in China is the greatest failure of capitalism and imperialism since the Soviet Union defeated Hitler. Following the Soviet Union, the first country in the world to establish a socialist state, and following the people's democratic countries that are building the initial scale of socialism within their own borders, the People's Republic of China is now embarking on the same path. When the forces of capitalism are pushed back again, the forces of socialism are advancing invincibly.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 30th. The Korean Central Government's organ, *Democratic Korea*, published an editorial on the 28th entitled "The Korean People Warmly Welcome the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference," which stated:

    The opening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference marks the basic victory of the Chinese people's democratic revolution. The Chinese people have overthrown the feudal forces that have ruled China for thousands of years, the imperialist forces that have invaded China for more than a hundred years, and the rule of bureaucratic capitalism for more than twenty years. The people's democratic China has entered a new historical era.

    This victory is the result of the Chinese people, as early as twenty-eight years ago, uniting under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, which represents the interests of the working people and fights for the liberation of the Chinese people, resolutely carrying out the anti-imperialist, anti-feudal, and anti-bureaucratic-capitalist struggle. It is the result of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, with the support of the people of the whole country, eliminating the imperialist and Chiang Kai-shek Kuomintang reactionary armed forces. It is also the result of the development of the Chinese People's United Front and the close unity with the international democratic forces led by the Soviet Union.

    This conference is a conference of great unity of all democratic and patriotic strata of the people of China. It is a concrete organizational form of the Chinese democratic united front, and at the same time, in terms of its members, it has the nature of the Chinese People's Congress. This is a manifestation of the expansion and strengthening of the Chinese People's United Front. The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, which implements the people's democratic dictatorship, will be established on this basis. The Chinese people's long-cherished wishes have been realized, and this event brings infinite glory to the new China.

    Mao Zedong also said that the state system of the people's democratic dictatorship in China is a powerful weapon to guarantee the victory of the Chinese people's revolution and to oppose the enemy's restoration conspiracy. He emphasized that internationally, we must unite with all peace-loving and freedom-loving countries and peoples, especially with the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries, and resolutely oppose imperialist aggression.

    All the peace-loving, freedom-loving, and happiness-seeking people of Korea warmly welcome the establishment of such a people's democratic country in neighboring China, which has a vast territory of 9,597,000 square kilometers and a population of 475 million. The leap forward of the people's democratic China has greatly encouraged the liberation struggles of the Eastern nations and is a huge force for striving for genuine world peace.

    In order to bury the southern half of the motherland as a colony of American imperialism, the U.S. imperialists and their running dogs, the Syngman Rhee traitorous party, are frantically carrying out cruel massacres and suppressions. The Korean people, who love their motherland, will more closely unite around the Central Government of the Republic, headed by our leader General Kim Il-sung, further strengthen the unity between our nation and the great Soviet Union, strengthen the unity with the people of the world, further expand and strengthen the Fatherland Front, and work hard to carry out economic, cultural, and defense of the motherland work, in order to expel American imperialism, eliminate the Syngman Rhee reactionary forces, and strive for peaceful reunification, to celebrate the victorious success of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, to celebrate the victorious success of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, which is held at this time in our neighboring China, which demonstrates the strong unity of the Chinese democratic forces and strengthens the unity of the international democratic camp, and is convened for the establishment of a new democratic China.

　　全世界人民向中国人民致贺 　 欢迎我人民共和国成立
    罗马尼亚总工会电我全总致贺
    【新华社布拉格三十日电】罗马尼亚总工会致电中华全国总工会，庆贺中华人民共和国的宣告成立，电文如下：
    北京中华全国总工会：
    值此中华人民共和国宣告成立之际，我们谨代表组织在总工会中的罗马尼亚人民共和国工人、职员和工程师，向英勇的中国人民致热烈的庆贺。我们无限钦佩地注视着解放军的艰苦战斗和辉煌的胜利，并祝你们在英勇的中国共产党及其大无畏的领袖们的领导下，在粉碎国民党残余，美英帝国主义的卑鄙奴仆上取得完全胜利。中华人民共和国将是以伟大的不可战胜的和平、自由与民族独立的堡垒——苏联为首的和平、民主与社会主义阵营中的重要的一员。
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    争取自由、反对帝国主义侵略者的斗争的领袖——英勇的中国共产党万岁！
    以全世界一切劳动人民的导师与朋友约瑟夫·维·斯大林所领导的伟大国家——胜利的社会主义苏联为首的世界民主与社会主义阵线万岁！

    波人民论坛报评论
    【新华社布拉格三十日电】波兰统一工人党机关报人民论坛报九月二十三日以“中华人民共和国”为题，发表社论，全文如下：
    “我们宣布中华人民共和国的成立”——胜利的中国人民领袖毛泽东同志用这句话来宣告新的人民国家的建立。
    中华人民共和国的宣告成立，是中国人民流了大量的鲜血，持续了几十年的斗争——争取他们的解放的斗争——的结果。中国人民曾进行斗争，反对他们本国的反动派和强大的外国侵略者，反对帝国主义国家的阴谋。经过了多次的胜利与失败，经过了前所未闻的牺牲，人民终于赢得了他们辉煌的胜利。中国人民之所以获得这一胜利，首先是因为他们一直受着大无畏的、从不退缩的共产党领导之下的工人阶级的领导。从马列主义正确的理论中，从伟大的社会主义十月革命的教训中，从先进的革命的党底经验以及从他们自己在中国革命运动中所获得的经验中，这个革命意志、政策与战略的强大的武库成长起来了，并且保证了中国共产党和英勇的中国人民在他们长时期的斗争中获得胜利。
    美国以数十亿美元以及大量武器、坦克、飞机和军火的输入无济于事，美国参谋们的意见与帮助亦属徒然——甚至美国人直接的军事干涉，也毫无效果。三年以来中国人民的军队从一个胜利走到另一个胜利，直至腐朽的和沉湎于贿赂中的卑鄙下贱的国民党政府——这个外国帝国主义的代理机构的卖国政府土崩瓦解为止。
    四万万中国人站在自由国家的队伍里。在古都北平召开的人民中国的协商会议现在正在奠定新的真正自由与独立的中国底基础。而同时，人民军队正在肃清国民党军的残余，正在解放中国其他地方。形式上仍存在有国民党政权的地区一天天地缩小。我们说“形式上”，是因为这个帝国主义卑鄙的代理机构事实上业已行使不了它的职权。
    毛泽东同志在北平协商会议上说：“我们的民族将从此列入爱好和平自由的世界各民族的大家庭”。“在国际上，我们必须和一切爱好和平自由的国家和人民团结在一起，首先是和苏联及各新民主国家团结在一起”。这些话明确而扼要地指出了中华人民共和国在今天正在全世界进行的争取和平与社会主义的这一伟大斗争中的作用和地位。
    英美帝国主义者尽管在中国已遭到惨败，然而，他们还将试图在国际政策上玩中国的牌。在联合国舞台上，他们还利用国民党政府，而且还利用蒋介石来拼凑他们的“太平洋公约”；美国国会还通过贷款来“帮助”这个政府。所有这些，当然都是打算一方面向中国人民挑战，而另一方面则欺骗中外舆论的无望的企图。
    帝国主义在中国的失败是自苏联击败希特勒以来，资本主义与帝国主义的一次最大的失败。继世界上第一个建立了社会主义国家的苏联之后，继正在其国内建设社会主义初步规模的人民民主国家之后，中华人民共和国现在正走上同样的道路。当资本主义力量又被打回去的时候，社会主义力量则在无敌地向前迈进。
   　民主朝鲜报评论
    【新华社平壤三十日电】朝鲜中央政府机关报“民主朝鲜”二十八日以“朝鲜人民热烈欢迎中国人民政治协商会议”为题发表社论说：
    中国人民政治协商会议的开幕标志着中国人民民主革命的基本胜利，中国人民推翻了数千年来统治中国的封建势力和百余年来侵略中国的帝国主义势力以及二十余年来官僚资本主义的统治。人民民主的中国进入了新的历史时代。
    这一胜利乃是中国人民早从廿八年前，在代表劳动人民利益并为中国人民解放而斗争的中国共产党的正确领导下，团结起来，坚决进行反帝反封建反官僚资本主义斗争的结果，是中国人民解放军在全国人民支援下消灭帝国主义和蒋介石国民党反动武装的结果，也是中国人民统一战线的发展以及与以苏联为首的国际民主力量紧密团结所造成的结果。
    这次会议是全中国民主主义爱国的各阶层人民之大团结的会议，它是中国民主统一战线的具体组织形式，同时就其成员来看，带有中国人民代表大会的性质。这是中国人民统一战线的扩大和增强的表现，实施中国人民民主专政的中华人民共和国中央人民政府即将在这一基础上建立。中国人民多年来的愿望实现了，这一事件给新中国带来无限的光荣。
    毛泽东又说，中国人民民主专政的国家制度是保障中国人民革命的胜利成果和反对敌人的复辟阴谋的有力武器，并强调说在国际上必须与一切爱好和平自由的国家和人民团结在一起，首先是与苏联及各新民主国家团结在一起，坚决反对帝国主义的侵略。
    爱好和平及自由幸福的全朝鲜人民热烈欢迎拥有九百五十九万七千方公里的广大领土和四万万七千五百万人口的邻邦中国建立了这种人民民主国家。人民民主的中国的跃进大大鼓舞了东方各民族的解放斗争，是争取真正世界和平的巨大力量。
    美帝国主义及其走狗李承晚卖国党徒为了将祖国南半部葬送成为美帝的殖民地，正在疯狂地进行残忍的屠杀和镇压。爱护自己祖国的朝鲜人民，将更加紧密地团结在以我国领导者金日成将军为首的共和国中央政府的周围，更加增强和解放我们民族的伟大苏联之间的团结并加强和世界人民的团结，更加扩大和强化祖国战线，并努力进行经济文化及保卫祖国的工作，为驱逐美帝国主义，肃清李承晚反动势力，为争取和平统一而斗争，这样来庆贺中国人民政治协商会议的胜利成功，庆贺在这个时间于我邻邦中国举行的、表现中国民主力量的坚强团结和加强国际民主阵营团结、并为建立新民主中国而召开的中国人民政治协商会议的胜利成功。
