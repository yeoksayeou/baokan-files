　　Long Live Great Chinese Mothers!
   　Also Starting with the Representatives of the CPPCC
    In this People's Political Consultative Conference, there are several great mothers participating, such as the veteran revolutionary He Xiangning, the mother of soldiers Rong Guanxiu, the farmer representative Li Xiuzhen...

    He Xiangning dedicated her sons, daughters, and sons-in-law to the revolution; Rong Guanxiu not only dedicated her own children to the revolution and the War of Liberation but also treated every Liberation Army soldier as if they were her own flesh and blood, like family; Li Xiuzhen, on the other hand, also sent her only son to join the People's Liberation Army, and even when he unfortunately sacrificed himself, she showed no grief, only determined to avenge him; she said, "I only had one son, and he was killed by the KMT reactionaries. I didn't shed a single tear." Because she believes that "my son sacrificed himself to serve the people, which is glorious, and all the comrades are avenging him."

    What great magnanimity, what resolute words! Such resolute words can only come from the mouths of women who are both revolutionary fighters and mothers, and only they possess such great magnanimity. This is because mothers, especially our Chinese mothers, have suffered from long-term oppression, exploitation, and inhuman treatment. Once awakened, their desire for liberation is naturally more urgent and more filled with the spirit of sacrifice; at the same time, it is also because, as Gorky said, they are "the only and inexhaustible force that can replenish the Earth, which has been repeatedly ravaged by death and destruction—whenever death swallows a person, somewhere in the world, a mother overcomes the natural force of death and offers the world a new person." They understand best the value of people, the meaning of labor, creation, life, and happiness, so they are naturally most willing to dedicate themselves to the revolution and the War of Liberation, showing themselves to be even more brave and determined.

    Gorky once praised the greatness of motherhood in this way: "You personally nurture the child, leading him into life and history—like a working laborer who enriches the world, like a hero, a humane warrior, a philosopher, an outstanding thinker… History attributes its glory and brilliant achievements to you, to…your sons…You have the power to make laws…You are the source of life…the permanent enemy of death, you are the great force that is forever fighting and overcoming death…"

    Yes, great mothers have the power to make laws; and haven’t our Chinese revolutionary mothers—He Xiangning, Rong Guanxiu, Li Xiuzhen, etc.—already come to the people's capital, sitting in the people's palace, together with other people's representatives, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, to jointly discuss the great plan of founding the country and jointly formulate the solemn "Organizational Law of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference," "Organizational Law of the Central People's Government," and "Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference"?

    This is the glory of Chinese mothers and the highest reward for their great dedication. Not only should all Chinese sons and daughters rejoice, be inspired, sing praises, and take pride in this unprecedented glory—the honor of our own mothers; but also women all over the world, mothers all over the world, and sons and daughters all over the world should enthusiastically cheer and congratulate the great honor of Chinese mothers, because truth has no national boundaries, and the victory and glory of the real people also have no national boundaries.

    Our great friendly country, the Soviet Union, attaches the greatest importance to motherhood. In addition to the universal establishment of nurseries and kindergartens, its Presidium of the Supreme Soviet also promulgated a special decree to protect motherhood on July 8, 1944. In this decree, specific provisions were made for special assistance and special praise for pregnant women, mothers with many children, and single mothers, expanded the scope of protection for mothers and children, created the title of Mother Hero, and established a system for awarding the Mother's Medal of Honor and the Mother's Medal. In the five years, 2.5 million mothers have received the Mother's Medal and the Mother's Medal of Honor, and thousands of women have been awarded the title of Mother Hero. From July 8, 1944, to May 1 of this year, the Soviet government has allocated 14,311,600,000 rubles in subsidies and allowances to families with many children and mothers who independently raise children. And Soviet mothers are indeed worthy of such respect and love, because they not only actively participated in the revolution and construction themselves but also dedicated the most outstanding children—such as Tanya and her brother Alexander—to the country. As for our China, as Comrade Li Xiuzhen pointed out, Article 6 of the "Draft Common Program of the People's Political Consultative Conference" clearly stipulates that the feudal system that binds women will be abolished forever, and women will have equal rights with men in political, economic, cultural, and educational fields. Although there are no special provisions for the protection of motherhood here, in the near future, after all construction has made considerable achievements, our central government will certainly promulgate special laws to protect motherhood and formulate detailed reward methods (in fact, all liberated areas already take special care of mothers and children, but because the war has not ended and the country's financial resources are not yet abundant, it cannot be as ideal as the Soviet Union), this can be asserted.

    In short, the great contribution of Chinese mothers to the revolution will be written in the most glorious page in the history of China, no, all mankind; their liberation, together with all female compatriots, is indeed a major earth-shaking event. I think that we, the children of these great Chinese mothers, will certainly shout in unison enthusiastically: Long live the great Chinese mothers!

### 伟大的中国母亲万岁！ 　也是从政协的代表们谈起

　　伟大的中国母亲万岁！
   　也是从政协的代表们谈起
    在这次人民政协大会上，是有好几个伟大的母亲参加的，例如革命老人何香凝，子弟兵的母亲戎冠秀，农民代表李秀真………
    何香凝把自己的儿子，女儿，女婿都献给革命；戎冠秀不但将自己的儿女献给革命和解放战争，而且看待每个解放战士都亲如骨肉，视同家人；李秀真呢，则叫自己的独生子也参加了人民解放军，不幸牺牲了也毫不悲痛，只立意报仇；她说：“我只有一个儿子，参了军，给蒋二秃子反动派杀害了，我一点眼泪也没有掉。”因为她认为“我的儿子为人民服务而牺牲，是光荣的，大家同志们都在给他报仇。”
    这是多伟大的心胸，多坚决的言语！这样坚决的言语，实在是只能出之于革命战士而又兼母亲的女性之口，这样伟大的心胸，也只是她们才有。这是因为母亲们，特别是咱们中国的母亲们，由于长期的受压迫，受剥削，受非人的待遇，一旦觉悟，渴求解放的心理，当然也更其迫切，更富于牺牲的精神；同时，也是由于她们正如高尔基所说，是“能把屡遭死亡毁灭的地球重新充实起来的唯一的和始终不竭的力量——任何时候死亡吞食了一个人，在世界的某只角落里，就有一个母亲克服了死亡的自然力，献给世界一个新的人。”她们最懂得人的可贵，最懂得劳动，创造，生活，幸福的意义，因此，自然也最愿意献身于革命和解放战争，表现得更为勇敢和坚决。
    高尔基又曾经这样地歌颂母性的伟大：“你亲自哺养孩子，把他引进生活和历史——好象一个把世界富裕起来的劳动工人，好象一个英雄，一个人道的战士，一个哲人，一个卓越的思想家……历史把它的光荣和辉煌的成就都归功于你，归功于…你们的儿子……你们有权力制定法律……你们是生命的源泉……是死亡的永久的仇敌，你们是永远战斗着而且克服着死亡的伟大力量……”
    是的，伟大的母亲是有权力制定法律的；而咱们中国的革命母亲们——何香凝、戎冠秀、李秀真等等，现在不是已经都来到了人民的首都，坐在人民的宫殿里，和其他的人民代表们一道，在共产党和毛主席的领导之下，共商开国的大计，共同制定了庄严的“中国人民政协组织法”、“中央人民政府组织法”、和“中国人民政协共同纲领”了吗？
    这是中国母亲们的光荣，是中国母亲们伟大献身的最高报酬。不但全中国儿女都应该为这空前的光荣——我们自己母亲们的荣誉而欢欣，而鼓舞，而歌颂，而引为自己的骄傲；就是全世界的妇女，全世界的母亲，全世界的儿女也要为这中国母亲的伟大荣誉而热烈欢呼，同声祝贺，因为真理并没有国界，真正人民的胜利和光荣，也是没有国界的。
    我们伟大的友邦——苏联，是最重视母性的。除了普遍地设立托儿所和幼稚园以外，它的最高苏维埃主席团还在一九四四年七月八日颁布了一个特别保护母性的法令。在这法令中，具体规定了对孕妇、儿女多的母亲，和独身母亲们的特别帮助，特别褒扬，扩大了保护母亲和小孩子的范围，创设了母亲英雄的称号，建立了颁发母亲荣誉章和母亲奖章的制度。五年来，已有二百五十万母亲得到了母亲奖章和母亲荣誉章，成千的妇女荣膺了母亲英雄的称号。从一九四四年七月八日到今年五月一日，苏联政府已拨付给儿女成群的家庭和独立抚养儿女的母亲们以一四、三一一、六○○、○○○卢布的津贴和补助。而苏联的母亲们，的确也是值得这种尊敬和爱护的，因为她们不但自己积极地参加了革命和建设，而且把最优秀的儿女——例如丹娘和她的哥哥亚力山大——献给国家。至于咱们中国，那末，正如李秀真同志所指出似的，在“人民政协共同纲领草案”中，第六条明明规定着从此永远废除束缚妇女的封建制度，在政治、经济、文化教育各方面，妇女都有与男子平等的权利。这儿虽还没有对于保护母性的特别规定，但在不久的未来，在一切建设都有了相当成绩以后，咱们的中央政府一定会颁布特别保护母性的法令，制定详尽的奖励办法（事实上现在各解放区已经对母亲和小孩子特别照顾，只是因战争尚未结束，国家财力尚未充裕，还不能象苏联那样的合于理想罢了），这是可以断言的。
    总之，中国母亲们对于革命的伟大贡献，将在中国的，不，全人类的历史上写下最光荣的一页；她们和全体妇女同胞们的解放，的确是一件翻天覆地的重大事情。我想，我们这些中国伟大母亲们的儿女，一定会同声地热烈地欢呼：伟大的中国母亲万岁！
    九月二十八日，于北京西郊。
