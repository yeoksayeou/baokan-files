　　【Special Dispatch from Tianjin This Paper】Since the scope of the North China Foreign Trade Administration was reduced, the number of export merchants applying for foreign exchange settlement and export has increased significantly. From the 25th to the 27th, the bureau received about 100 applications, averaging more than 30 per day. Exports to the United States included carpets, straw braid, sausage casings, peach kernels, and handicrafts. Exports to Hong Kong were mainly fresh eggs, followed by vermicelli, Chinese medicine, etc. The number of applications for barter trade has gradually decreased, averaging less than 30 per day. Those for the United States were limited to drawnwork products, embroidery, lace, clothing, and raw wool, and the number was small. Chinese medicine was the most frequent for Hong Kong, followed by melon seeds, chestnuts, dates, vegetables, and fresh fruits in small quantities, as well as hemp and ham. Due to the general increase in the price of imported goods, applications for imports were quite enthusiastic. In addition to the 50 self-provided foreign exchange import applications approved by the bureau within three days, totaling US$7,500 and HK$430,000, an average of about 50 applications for foreign exchange settlement and import were received every day. The main imported materials were rubber, dinitro chemical raw materials, and metal products, reaching US$84,000 and HK$910,000 on the 25th alone.
    In addition, barter trade permit applications received by the bureau before the 24th, except for those that have completed the procedures and have been signed, will be issued to merchants as before. The remaining applications that have not yet been reviewed will be returned. However, if the applying merchants can prove that they have reached an agreement and signed a contract with foreign merchants, the import and export trade association can sign and note their opinions, summarize them and submit them to the bureau for consideration.

　　华北对外贸易结汇出口增加
    【本天津报专讯】华北对外贸易管理局缩小范围后，出口商人申请结汇出口者显著增加，自二十五日至廿七日，该局共收到申请书一百份左右，平均每日卅余份。申请对美出口者包括地毡、草帽辫、肠衣、桃仁、手工艺品等。对港出口者主要是鲜蛋，其余为粉丝、汉药等。至于申请易货者已渐减少，每日平均不到三十份，对美者谨挑花品、绣花品、花边、衣饰，及元尾毛，为数不多。对港者汉药最多，次为瓜子、栗子、枣、蔬菜、鲜果等为数不多，此外尚有麻、火腿。进口方面因进口货价普遍上涨，申请进口者颇为踊跃，除该局三日内批准自备外汇进口五十份计美金七千五百元及港币四十三万元外，平均每日申请结汇进口者达五十份左右。主要进口物资为橡胶、二硝基化学原料、金属品等，仅二十五日一日内即达美金八万四千元及港币九十一万元。
    又该局二十四日以前收进易货许可申请书除已办竣手续并已签妥者，照旧将许可发给商人外，其余尚未审核者，具已退还，但申请之商户如能证明已与外国商妥定立合同，可由进出口业公会签注意见，汇总转呈该局予以考虑。
