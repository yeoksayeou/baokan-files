　　"The fortress is most easily captured from within" - this is one of the important lessons pointed out in the epilogue of the "History of the CPSU (B.)". With only a slight familiarity with the history of the Constitutionalist faction, one will find that the enemies of the Chinese revolution have always understood this point, and are quite skilled at it.

　　After 1905, the reactionary and dark Qing government wanted to use the promise of "preparing for constitutionalism" to ease the already very imminent revolutionary crisis. It caused a portion of people who were dissatisfied with the Qing's autocratic backwardness but afraid of revolution to rise up and demand that the "constitutional monarchy" be quickly implemented. They established various organizations, publicized and appealed everywhere, forming a small movement in a certain social stratum. And the people who participated in this movement became a separate political faction - the Constitutionalist faction. Zhang Jian, Tang Shouqian, Xiong Xiling, Wu Tingfang, Tang Hualong, Tan Yankai, and others, who were representatives of the big bourgeoisie and "enlightened" landlords and new-style bureaucrats, were the prominent leaders of this faction.

　　Even earlier than the Constitutionalist faction, there were two groups with the nature of political parties, one was the Tongmenghui, which led the revolution, and the other was the Royalist Party, which opposed the revolution. The Constitutionalist faction differed from the two parties in that it appeared as a "middle" party from the beginning. They opposed the Tongmenghui and also refused to publicly cooperate with the Royalist Party. Especially on the central issue of "implementing a constitutional system," the Tongmenghui believed that "republican constitutionalism" was necessary, that is, first overthrow the Qing dynasty by revolutionary means, and then implement democratic constitutionalism. The Constitutionalist faction firmly opposed this, saying that it was "holding the great weapon upside down" and was too left. At the same time, the Royalist Party believed that only "enlightened despotism should be used as preparation for constitutionalism" because "the people's level has not yet reached the standard". The Constitutionalist faction also disagreed, saying that this would be "enduring forever" and was too right. Therefore, they themselves came to the conclusion: "To sum up, if we want a political system that is beneficial and without disadvantages, the constitutional monarchy system is the most preferable" - with the addition of one point: immediate implementation. However, the Qing government was so weak that it did not dare to firmly adopt even such a moderate policy. After issuing an edict in 1906 to "imitate constitutional government," it continued to perfunctorily deal with the matter until the wave of railway protection movements rose in various places in 1911, causing the Constitutionalist faction to be greatly disappointed after various enthusiastic efforts, and had to consider changing methods to continue maintaining the ruling interests of their class.

　　On October 10 of the same year, the New Army under the influence of the Tongmenghui launched an uprising in Wuchang, quickly forming a surging wave of uprising masses attacking the Qing rule with weapons. However, many shortcomings in the leadership of the uprising were quickly exposed from all aspects, and then the methods that the Constitutionalist faction wanted to re-adopt were found.

　　On the fourth day of the Wuchang Uprising, Tang Hualong, the head of the Constitutionalist faction and speaker of the Hubei Provincial Assembly, first became the Minister of Civil Affairs of the Wuhan Military Government. On October 22, Tan Yankai, the speaker of the Hunan Provincial Assembly, became the military governor of Hunan. Soon, Pu Dianjun, the speaker of the Sichuan Provincial Assembly, and Tang Shouqian of Zhejiang also successively obtained the title of military governor. For a time, many important figures of the Constitutionalist faction hung up the "revolution" banner, and claimed that they had always been "supporting" the "central figures" of the revolution, and began to insert one of their feet into the revolutionary camp.

　　On the same day that Tang Hualong joined the "revolution," Zhang Jian, another important leader of the Constitutionalist faction, rushed from Hubei to Nanjing, and went to see Tie Liang, the Qing "General," asking him to immediately send reinforcements to Hubei. At the same time, he petitioned the Qing court to "quickly issue a discussion on the constitution to be implemented." Tie Liang refused to make a decision. On the 25th, Zhang Jian went to see Zhang Renjun, the Governor-General of Liangjiang, saying that "Wuchang is located upstream, and if the enemy goes down the river, and Anqing responds to it, Jiangning is in danger." Zhang Renjun did not listen. The next day, Zhang Jian ran to Suzhou to find Cheng Dequan, the Governor of Jiangsu, and reiterated his "proposal to quickly issue a constitution and open a national assembly." Cheng Dequan agreed, and Zhang immediately drafted a memorial for Cheng Dequan with two other Constitutionalist faction members, Lei Fen and Yang Tingdong. On November 1, the Jiangsu Provincial Assembly directly telegraphed the Qing government: "Please announce the constitution and open a national assembly." Putting their other foot still standing in the Qing court.

　　By mid-November, the uprisings and independence in various places were still continuing to develop. Under the strict supervision of the imperialist - especially British and American imperialist - representatives in China, such as Zhu Erdian, the Qing central government had to re-appoint Yuan Shikai, who was "in seclusion" in Zhangde. He was to form a cabinet and formally propose to the militia the four conditions of "1. issuing an edict of self-reproach, 2. implementing constitutionalism, 3. lifting the ban on parties, and 4. the imperial family not interfering in state affairs" to seek peace. Tang Shaoyi was sent as a representative to negotiate in Hankou. Zhu Erdian even instructed the British consul in Hankou to come out and introduce the peace talks. And the Qing government's high-ranking officials and battlefield commanders were also at a loss in the face of the uprising army, and fled one after another. The Constitutionalist faction then further emphasized the complete necessity of "republicanism," and advised the Qing court to abdicate immediately. In November, Zhang Jian sent a separate letter to the Qing cabinet saying: "Now the call for republicanism has only been around for a month, and the whole country has been swept away... Only a few officials in the north are attached to their own selfish calculations, forgetting the great danger of the whole country, and still maintaining the constitutional monarchy. However, this kind of fallacy is denied by the whole country." As if they had completely forgotten that only they themselves were the firm advocates and implementers of "this kind of fallacy." On the 14th of the same month, Zhang Jian, Tang Shouqian, Zhao Fengchang, and others even telegraphed the Zhangjiakou Chamber of Commerce to relay to Inner and Outer Mongolia, asking them to also "support republicanism." On the same day, Zhang Jian simply refused the Qing government's attempt to win him over by appointing him as a "comfort envoy" and "Minister of Agriculture, Industry, and Commerce." Other Constitutionalist faction members ran from Shanghai to Hankou, and then from Hankou to Nanjing. They elected Huang Xing as "Grand Marshal" and were also preparing to elect Sun Yat-sen as "President."

　　But at the same time, on the other hand, the Constitutionalist faction put the Qing government aside and began secret negotiations with Yuan Shikai on how to privately transfer the presidency. One of Zhang Jian's many secret telegrams to Yuan Shikai read:

　　"On day A, the Manchus will retreat, and on day B, we will support you. All parties in the southeast have agreed... I hope you will exert your heroic strategy, settle the overall situation in the blink of an eye, bring boundless rest to the people, and also your fame and infinite benefits."

　　Yang Du, the leader of the Constitutionalist faction in the north at that time, even pulled Wang Jingwei, a traitorous member of the Tongmenghui, together and put up the banner of the "National Affairs Remediation Association" in Beijing on November 15, allowing Wang to secretly serve Yuan Shikai from within the Tongmenghui. At this time, Yuan Shikai was still pretending and really had no certainty to agree. Among the many return telegrams received by Zhang Jian from Yuan Shikai, one read: "Kai is weak and sick and has no improper thoughts... It is not easy to speak of republicanism in the north, just as it is not easy to speak of monarchy in the south... Difficulties are immense." But the Constitutionalist faction was not afraid of these difficulties and continued to work hard for Yuan Shikai.

　　This is the main means of the Constitutionalist faction's activities from the Wuchang Uprising to the establishment of the Nanjing government. The Tongmenghui, which led the uprising, not only did not raise its vigilance and expose it, but also went through them to deal with Yuan Shikai, allowing their conspiracy to develop further. By the time Sun Yat-sen returned from the United States to Shanghai on December 25, and the Nanjing government was formed on January 1, 1912, the Constitutionalist faction had cultivated its power very firmly under the cover of a fake revolutionary mask, becoming an invincible opposition faction to the Tongmenghui in the Nanjing government.

　　In the Nanjing government, in addition to Sun Yat-sen and Li Yuanhong serving as President and Vice President respectively, the lineup of the State Council was: Army Minister Huang Xing, Education Minister Cai Yuanpei, Navy Minister Huang Zhongying - Tongmenghui. Industry Minister Zhang Jian, Transportation Minister Tang Shouqian, Justice Minister Wu Tingfang - Constitutionalist faction. Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui, Interior Minister Cheng Dequan, Finance Minister Chen Jintao - bureaucrat politicians, not belonging to either party, but having ties with both parties respectively. Obviously, this was a temporary coalition government of the Tongmenghui and the Constitutionalist faction. The Tongmenghui had military power on the surface, but in reality, it did not have much reliable armed forces. The Constitutionalist faction did not have financial power on the surface, but in reality, it had the financial resources to influence the future of the government. Initially, the Tongmenghui decided to appoint Zhang Jian as the Finance Minister, wanting to rely on him to raise a sum of funds. When Sun Yat-sen returned to Shanghai, he announced that he was penniless, and only after Huang Xing repeatedly requested Zhang Jian did Zhang issue a "guarantee" to borrow 300,000 silver dollars from the Mitsui Bank of Japan for the government's start-up expenses. At this time, Zhang Jian published an "Opinion on the Finances of the New Nanjing Government," saying that there was an astonishing amount of 80 million taels per year that could not be raised, therefore, he "cannot serve as Minister of Finance." This was the first move of the Constitutionalist faction as the opposition.

　　After the Nanjing government was formally established, the Constitutionalist faction nominally served as several "ministers," but they never attended State Council meetings, let alone performed any duties. This was their second move as the opposition.

　　Since the government had very few reliable armed forces, it entrusted many miscellaneous troops with small strength and small names, with the Ministry of the Army responsible for military pay, making Sun Yat-sen and Huang Xing described as "exhausting all means." Huang Xing repeatedly begged Zhang Jian: "I hope you can help me." Zhang expressed his inability to do so. Later, Sun and Huang actually mortgaged the Hanyeping Company to the Japanese to borrow money directly. Zhang Jian said that he "shamelessly served as Minister of Industry and bears full responsibility for this," and insisted on opposing it. Sun Yat-sen, Huang Xing, Hu Hanmin, and others repeatedly explained, he resigned from his position. Sun Yat-sen sincerely tried to retain him, and said, "In times of crisis, leaving one's post is probably not what you would bear," but he resolutely left. This was another move of theirs as the opposition.

　　Zhang Taiyan and others, who originally belonged to the Tongmenghui and simply opposed the Manchus, proposed "when the revolutionary army rises, the revolutionary party should disband" before and after Sun Yat-sen returned to China. Zhang Jian and others in the Constitutionalist faction also proposed to Sun Yat-sen to "eliminate the party name." Now Zhang Jian and Zhang Taiyan, Cheng Dequan, Zhao Fengchang, and others formed the "Unity Party" to implement a new organization to confront the Tongmenghui inside and outside the government. This was yet another move of the Constitutionalist faction as the opposition party of the Nanjing Government.

　　These many opposition activities of the Constitutionalist faction were not only inseparable from their conspiracy to support Yuan Shikai, but also completely consistent with the imperialist policy of disintegrating the Nanjing government. When Sun Yat-sen still had illusions about the US government, and Wang Chonghui, in his capacity as Foreign Minister, twice requested the US government to recognize the Nanjing government, the US government ignored them, and together with the UK, created an atmosphere of "without Yuan, there will be destruction," "no one but Yuan," and "no recognition without Yuan" in China, putting pressure on the Nanjing government. Under the above circumstances, Sun Yat-sen had no choice but to obtain the empty name of "republicanism" and, through the form of "peace talks between the North and the South", vowed to hand over power to Yuan Shikai. By mid-January, the public negotiations between Wu Tingfang of the Southern Constitutionalist faction and Tang Shaoyi, and the secret negotiations between Yang Du of the Northern Constitutionalist faction and Wang Jingwei, had matured the plan for the Qing dynasty to abdicate, Sun Yat-sen to resign as provisional president, and Yuan Shikai to succeed. At this time, Zhang Jian quickly drafted an "abdication edict" for the Qing dynasty in Shanghai, and telegraphed Yuan Shikai to announce it for the Qing court. The most important passage was:

　　"Yuan Shikai was previously elected as Prime Minister by the Consultative Yuan. At this time of the change of the old and the new, there should be a way to unify the North and the South. Yuan Shikai should organize a temporary republican government with full power and consult with the militia on the unified method."

　　This not only gave Yuan Shikai a public handle to receive the two regimes of the North and the South in the name of the Qing imperial family, but also clearly stipulated that the nature of Yuan Shikai's regime was not a continuation of the uprising government, but a continuation of the Qing rule. After the Constitutionalist faction completed all these important processes step by step, Sun Yat-sen was forced to announce his resignation on February 13, the day after the Qing dynasty abdicated, and Yuan Shikai, the concentrated representative of imperialism and feudal forces, sat in the seat of the provisional president.

　　Originally, the Constitutionalist faction echoed the uprising, pretended to be revolutionary, and then withdrew halfway, causing the uprising camp to collapse. This kind of unpredictable behavior was just to take power from the revolutionaries and hand it over to the counter-revolutionaries. After Yuan Shikai succeeded in seizing the position of president, the Constitutionalist faction's task of participating in the "revolution" was successfully completed.

　　In 1913, when some people in the original Tongmenghui launched the "Second Revolution," the Constitutionalist faction threw all the "middle," "revolutionary," and "united" banners to the wind, and Xiong Xiling, Zhang Jian, and Sun Baoqi came out to join the Royalist Party Liang Qichao, organizing the so-called "first-class talent cabinet" to temporarily stabilize Yuan Shikai's rule. A few days later, following the American imperialist apologist Goodnow, Yang Du and Yan Fu, among the Constitutionalist faction, joined several Tongmenghui traitors to launch the "Chou'an Society", transforming "President Yuan Shikai" into the "Emperor of the Chinese Empire" in the three months from August to November 1916. This was the great success of the Constitutionalist faction.

　　There is no doubt that the Constitutionalist faction was able to play a role only because of the weakness of the Chinese bourgeoisie leading the revolution and the Tongmenghui's lack of a mass base. Now, history has long entered a new stage, and all the subjective and objective conditions of the revolution are no longer comparable, but this historical lesson is still worth our review and vigilance.

　　介绍辛亥革命运动中的君主立宪派
    刘大年
    “堡垒是最容易从内部夺取的”——这是“联共（布）党史”结束语所指出的重要教训之一。只须稍微熟悉一下君主立宪派的历史，就会发现中国革命的敌人，也向来懂得这一点，而且还很熟练。
    一九○五年以后，反动黑暗的满清政府，想拿“准备立宪”作为诺言，来和缓一下已经十分迫近的革命危机。使一部分对满清专制落后不满而又对革命害怕的人们，起来要求把“君主立宪政体”赶快见诸实行。他们建立各种组织，到处宣传号召，在一定社会阶层里形成一个小小运动。而参加这个运动的人们在政治上也就单独成为一个派别——君主立宪派。身为大资产阶级与“开明”地主新式官僚代表的张謇、汤寿潜、熊希龄、伍廷芳、汤化龙、谭延＠等等，就是这个派别前后出名的领袖人物。
    比立宪派更早形成的，还有两个政党性质的团体，一个是领导革命的同盟会，另一个就是反对革命的保皇党。立宪派与两党不同，一开始就以“中间”面貌出现。他们反对同盟会，也拒绝与保皇党公开合作。特别是在“实行立宪政体”这个中心问题上，同盟会认为要“共和立宪”，即先用革命手段推翻满清，然后实行民主宪政。立宪派坚决反对，说这是“太阿倒持”，未免过左。与此同时，保皇党认为只能“以开明专制为立宪制之预备”，因为“人民程度未及格”的缘故。立宪派也不赞成，说这将“隐忍终古”，又未免太右。因此，他们自己就作出结论：“要之政体不一，而欲求有利无弊，首推立宪君主之制”——此外附加一点：立即实行。可是，满清政府却衰弱得连这么一个温和政策也不敢坚决采取。自一九○六年下诏“仿行宪政”后，直到一九一一年各地争路风潮已起，还在一味敷衍搪塞，使立宪派在各种热诚努力之后，大失所望，不得不考虑要改变方式，来继续维持它们这个阶级的统治利益。
    同年十月十日，同盟会影响下的新军在武昌起义，很快形成一个起义群众向清朝统治武装进攻的汹涌浪潮。但起义领导上的许多缺点，又从各方面迅速暴露出来，于是，君主立宪派们所要重新采取的方式就找到了。
    武昌起义的第四天，君主立宪派首领之一，湖北咨议局长汤化龙首先变成了武汉军政府的民政部长，十月二十二日湖南咨议局长谭延＠又变成了湘军都督，不久四川的咨议局长蒲殿俊，浙江的汤寿潜也相继取得都督名号，一时君主立宪派的许多重要脚色都挂起“革命”旗帜，并自称一向就是“拥护”革命的“中心人物”，开始把他们的一只脚插在革命阵营中。
    就在汤化龙参加“革命”的同一天，立宪派另外一位重要首领张謇急忙从湖北赶到南京，往见满清“将军”铁良，要他马上派援兵赴鄂，同时；向清室奏请“速颁决行宪法之论”，铁良不肯作主，二十五日张謇往见两江总督张人骏，说“武昌地据上游，若敌顺流而下，安庆又有应之者，江宁危矣”。张人骏不听，张謇又于第二天跑到苏州找江苏巡抚程德全，重申他的“请速颁宪法开国会之议”，程德全同意，张立刻同另外两位立宪派分子雷奋、杨廷栋替程德全起草奏折。到十一月一日江苏咨议局又直接致电清政府：“请宣布立宪开国会”。把他们的另一只脚仍然站在满清朝廷里。
    到十一月中、各地起义，独立还在继续发展，满清中央政府在帝国主义——特别是英美帝国主义的驻华代表朱尔典等严厉督责下，只得重新起用“隐居”在彰德的袁世凯，由他组织内阁，正式向民军提出“一、下罪已诏，二、实行立宪，三、开除党禁，四、皇族不问国政”四个条件求和。派唐绍仪为代表到汉口谈判。朱尔典更训令汉口英领事出来介绍和议。而清政府的封疆大吏与战地指挥官们，在起义军面前也都莫展一筹，相率逃走。君主立宪派遂一面进一步、强调“共和”的完全必要，劝告清室马上退位。十一月间张謇单独致清内阁一信说：“今共和主义之号召甫及一月，而全国风靡，……惟北方少数官吏恋一身之私计，忘全国之大危，尚保持君主立宪耳，然，此种谬论，全国非之。”好象已经完全忘记了，只有他们自己，才是“此种谬论”的坚决倡导者与执行人。同月十四日，张謇、汤寿潜、赵凤昌等更致电张家口商会转内外蒙古，要它们也“赞成共和”。同一天，张謇又干脆拒绝清政府委他做什么“宣慰使”、“农工商大臣”的拉拢。其他立宪派分子则从上海跑到汉口，又从汉口跑到南京。选举了黄兴为“大元帅”，还准备选举孙中山为“大总统”。
    但同时，另外一面，立宪派把满清政府放到一边，开始了秘密和袁世凯谈判如何私相授受总统的问题。在张謇给袁世凯的许多秘密电报中有一个是这样说的：
    “甲日满退，乙日拥公，东南诸方，一切通过……愿公奋其英略，旦夕之间，戡定大局，为人民无疆之休，亦即公声名俱泰无穷之利。”
    在北方当时的立宪派首领杨度更拉着同盟会内叛卖分子汪精卫于十一月十五日在北京打出“国事匡济会”的名义，让汪暗中从同盟会内部为袁世凯效力。这时袁世凯还装腔作势，也确实没有把握就答应下来，张謇接到的许多袁世凯回电中，其一有云：“凯衰病断无非分之想……在北不易言共和，犹之在南不易言君主……困难万分”。但立宪派并不怕这些困难，还是一直为袁世凯努力下去。
    这就是君主立宪派从武昌起义到南京政府成立期间活动的主要手段。领导起义的同盟会，对此不但没有提起警惕，加以揭穿，而且还通过他们去和袁世凯打交涉，让他们的阴谋更得到了发展。等到十二月二十五日孙中山从美国回抵上海，一九一二年一月一日组成南京政府，立宪派已在假革命面具掩盖下，把自己的势力培植得非常牢固，成为同盟会在南京政府中所不可战胜的反对派了。
    南京政府除孙中山与黎元洪分任正副总统外，国务院的阵容是：陆军黄兴，教育蔡元培，海军黄钟英——同盟会。实业张謇，交通汤寿潜，司法伍廷芳——立宪派。外交王宠惠，内务程德全，财政陈锦涛——官僚政客，不属两党，但又分别与两党有联系。很明显，这是一个同盟会与君主立宪派的临时联合政府。同盟会表面上有兵权，但实际上它没有多少可靠的武装。立宪派表面上没有财权，但是实际上它有足以影响政府前途的财力。最初同盟会会内定张謇为财政总长，想借重他筹划一笔经费。孙中山回到上海时曾经宣布，他是两袖清风，一钱不名，只有经过黄兴向张謇再三要求，才由张出具“保证书”向日本三井洋行借得三十万银元的政府开办费。正在这时，张謇发表了一个“对于南京新政府财政意见书”，说每年有八千万两这个惊人数目的款额无处可筹，因此，他“不能担任财政”。这是立宪派作为反对派的第一着。
    南京政府正式成立后，立宪派在名义上担任了几个“总长”，但是，他们从来不出席国务会议，更谈不到执行任何职务。这是他们作为反对派的再一着。
    政府可靠武装既很少，就委任许多实力不大名义不小的杂色军队，由陆军部负责军饷，弄得孙中山与黄兴被形容为“罗掘俱穷”。黄兴几次恳求张謇：“望公有以助我”。张表示无能为力。后来孙、黄竟向日本人抵押汉冶萍公司去直接借款，张謇说他“忝任实业，对此负有全责”，又坚持反对。孙中山，黄兴，胡汉民等再三解释，他提出辞职不干。孙中山竭诚挽留，并说“时危拂衣，想非所忍”，但他坚决拂衣而去。这是他们作为反对派的又一着。
    原属同盟会而只单纯反满的章太炎等，在孙中山回国前后，就提出“革命军起，革命党销”。立宪派中张謇等也曾向孙中山提议“销除党名”。现在张謇与章太炎、程德全、赵凤昌等组成“统一党”，实行用新的组织在政府内外与同盟会对抗。这是立宪派作为南京政府反对派的再又一着。
    君主立宪派这许多反对活动，不但与它们拥戴袁世凯的阴谋分不开，而且与帝国主义瓦解南京政府的政策也完全一致。当孙中山还对美政府存有幻想，由王宠惠以外交总长资格两次请求美政府对南京政府加以承认时，美政府一概不理，反同英国一起，在中国国内制造出“非袁则亡”、“非袁莫属”、“非袁则不承认”的空气，对南京政府施以压力。在上述情形下，孙中山只好以落得“共和”两个字的空名，经过“南北议和”形式，发誓把政权向袁世凯交出去。到一月中旬南方立宪派伍廷芳与唐绍仪之间的公开交涉，及北方立宪派杨度与汪精卫之间的秘密交涉，把满清退位，孙中山也辞去临时大总统，由袁世凯继任的方案谈判成熟。这时，张謇就在上海赶紧起草一个满清退位“诏书”，电达袁世凯替清廷宣布，最重要的一段是：
    “袁世凯前经咨政院选举为总理大臣，当兹新旧代谢之际，宜有南北统一之方，即由袁世凯以全权组织临时共和政府，与民军协商统一办法。”
    这不仅用清室名义给了袁世凯一个接收南北两政权的公开把柄，而且也明白规定了袁世凯政权的性质不是起义政府的继续，而是满清统治的一脉相承。君主立宪派们把所有这些重要过程一步步完成之后，孙中山遂被迫于满清退位的次日——二月十三日宣布辞职，由帝国主义与封建势力的集中代表袁世凯坐上了临时大总统的位子。
    原来君主立宪派附和起义，冒牌革命，又半路拆伙，让起义阵营垮台，这样翻云复雨，就为的是把政权从革命派手里拿过来，再交到反革命派手里去。袁世凯夺取总统地位成功后，君主立宪派参加“革命”的任务也就胜利完成了。
    到了一九一三年，原来同盟会中一部分人发动“二次革命”，立宪派把所有“中间”、“革命”、“联合”的幌子一律抛到九霄云外，由熊希龄、张謇、孙宝琦出来与保皇党梁启超打成一片，组织所谓“第一流人才内阁”，把袁世凯的统治暂时稳定下来。再过几天，跟在美帝国主义论客古德诺后面，君主立宪派中的杨度、严复等联合几个同盟会叛徒发起“筹安会”，从一九一六年八月到同年十一月的三个月中，就把一个“今大总统袁世凯”变成了“中华帝国皇帝”。这就是君主立宪派的大功告成。
    没有疑问，只有由于领导革命的中国资产阶级的软弱，同盟会缺乏群众力量的基础，君主立宪派才能够发生了作用。现在，历史早已走进一个新的阶段，革命的一切主客观条件，已经无法相提并论了，但是这一段历史教训，却仍然值得我们的温习和警惕。
