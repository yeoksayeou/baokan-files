　　Learning Policies and Discussing Land Reform Steps
　　Agricultural Representatives' Conferences Held in Suburban Districts of Beijing, Laying a Good Foundation for Land Reform Work
    [Our Newspaper's Report] Since the conclusion of the Beijing Suburban Work Committee's cadre expansion meeting, the eight districts in the suburbs of Beijing have successively held agricultural representatives' conferences to study policies and discuss land reform steps. Farmer representatives from all districts studied the reports on land reform issues in the suburbs given by Peng Zhen, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Chai Zemin, Secretary of the Suburban Committee, with a serious attitude. The representatives all expressed their heartfelt support for the land reform policies in the suburbs. Han Derong, a farmer representative from Shibalidian in the Fourteenth District, said: "Let's have a good discussion, study the policies, and go back to unite the poor, hired, and middle peasants well, resolutely eliminate the landlord class, and let us peasants stand up straight." Farmer representatives from the Thirteenth District discussed the issues very seriously, getting up before dawn every day and studying until 9:00 PM. Some illiterate representatives also bought diaries and asked literate representatives to help them record the questions.
    Due to the leadership's serious communication and enthusiastic group discussions, the farmer representatives had a deeper understanding of the land reform policies, which laid a good foundation for future land reform work. At the agricultural representatives' conference in the Seventeenth District, farmer representatives from Bajia Village proposed: Everyone should break with sentimentality, get rid of bias, and prevent falling into the landlords' "air raid shelters." Farmer representatives from Changxindian put forward specific opinions on how to start organizing teams, expanding the peasant association, carefully classifying classes, and combining production with engaging in sideline production in winter. The villages of Lishisan and Lujiatan in the district, because there were no landlords or rich peasants, and the existing problems were only among the peasants, determined to focus on organizing production, combined with publicizing land reform policies, strengthening class education, and resolving land disputes among the peasants.
    During this study and discussion, some individual farmer representatives still had "leftist" tendencies in their thinking, such as the idea of ​​struggling against bullies and lackeys regardless of the severity of their crimes, as well as absolute egalitarianism. With the instructions from the Municipal Party Committee's Suburban Committee, most of them have been corrected in time.
    The convening of the agricultural representatives' conferences in the suburbs this time not only raised the awareness of the peasants, but also made full ideological mobilization for land reform in the suburbs. （Leng Lin, Zhao Youfu, Zhang Jinlin, Liu Yi, Propaganda Department of the Thirteenth District, Correspondence Group of the Seventeenth District）

　　学习政策讨论土改步骤　
    京郊各区开农代会　
    打下土改工作良好基础
    【本报讯】自北京市郊区工作委员会扩干会结束以后，京郊八个区先后分别召开了农代大会，学习政策并讨论土改步骤。各区农民代表都以严肃态度学习了中共北京市委书记彭真和郊委书记柴泽民关于郊区土地改革问题的报告。代表们对郊区的土改政策都表示衷心的拥护。十四区十八里店农民代表韩得荣说：“咱们好好的讨论，学习政策，回去把贫、雇、中农团结好，坚决消灭地主阶级，让咱农民直起腰来”。十三区的农民代表们讨论时非常认真，每天天不亮就起来，一直学习到晚上九点钟。有些不识字的代表也都买了日记本让识字的代表帮助自己记上问题。
    由于领导上认真的传达和小组的热烈讨论，农民代表们对土改政策都有了较深刻的了解，这给今后进行土改工作打下了很好的基础。郊十七区在农代会上，八家村的农民代表提出：要大家打破情面，去掉偏心，防止掉进了地主的“防空洞”。长辛店农民代表对如何下手整理队伍、扩大农会、慎重的划分阶级，并结合生产及冬季搞副业生产都提出了具体意见。该区的里十三、鲁家滩等村因为没有地主、富农，所存在的问题仅是农民之间的，所以确定了以组织生产为中心工作，并结合着宣传土改政策，加强阶级教育与解决农民之间的土地纠纷。
    在此次学习和讨论中，个别的农民代表在思想上还存有“左”的偏向，如对恶霸、狗腿不分罪恶大小准备一齐斗的思想，以及绝对平均主义等思想，经市委郊委会指示，大部已及时纠正。
    这次各郊区农代会的召开不但提高了农民的觉悟，而且也为郊区土改作了充分的思想动员。  （冷林、赵有福、张进霖、刘易、十三区宣传部、十七区通讯组）
