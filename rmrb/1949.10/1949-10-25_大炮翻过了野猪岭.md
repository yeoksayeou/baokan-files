　　Cannons Conquer Wild Boar Ridge
    Wang Min
    After a night of mountain marching, the artillery regiment's third and sixth companies of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army arrived at the foot of Wild Boar Ridge.
    It was already dawn, and everyone was hungry. However, Wild Boar Ridge, nestled between Tang Ridge and Mawei, stood in their way. It was 851 meters above sea level, with slopes that consistently angled at 60 degrees. The road was so narrow that even people and horses without loads could barely pass. Now, in order to cooperate with the infantry in annihilating the bandit troops and blockading the estuary to cut off the bandits' escape by sea, the artillerymen were determined to carry mountain gun parts weighing from 90 to over 200 pounds across Wild Boar Ridge.
    The operation began. Comrade Jiang Shuping, the deputy squad leader of the first squad of the third company, took the lead in carrying the large frame weighing 220 pounds together with other comrades, placing the heaviest end on his own shoulder. Other comrades also helped each other, some carrying, some lifting, some pulling, some holding, and some pushing, moving step by step towards the summit of Wild Boar Ridge. Their legs felt like they were carrying hundreds of pounds of weight. Sweat dripped down their faces after only a few steps, and they were soaked through. Some were knocked down by the excessively heavy parts, but without a groan, they grabbed a handful of weeds and stood up to continue forward. Liu Fuwen of the seventh squad of the sixth company was knocked down by the slide, weighing over 190 pounds. His knee was broken, and fresh blood flowed onto the back of his foot, but he ignored it, got up, put the slide on his shoulder, and continued to move forward. Finally, everyone victoriously reached the summit.
    On the summit, the artillerymen wiped the sweat from their faces and shouted happily, "Revolutionary fighters have strong will, working together to move upwards, annihilating the remaining bandits and liberating the great Fujian!" Then, they mustered their courage and carried the guns down the slope. No one complained, because everyone clearly remembered, "Today's hardship is tomorrow's glory." At the foot of the other side of Wild Boar Ridge, the artillerymen looked at the mountain guns, which were almost soaked with their own sweat, and smiled victoriously, saying in unison, "We have conquered the difficulties!"

　　大炮翻过了野猪岭
    王民
    经一夜的山地行军，解放军某部炮团三、六连到达了野猪岭山脚下。
    天已是拂晓时候，大家肚子都饿了，而必须经过的盘踞在汤岭、马尾之间的野猪岭，阻在前面，高出海面八百五十一公尺，山坡是常成六十度的倾斜角，道路狭窄得连空人空马都难通过。现在，炮兵们为着配合步兵歼灭匪军，封锁江口斩断匪军海上逃路，下了决心，要抬着重达九十斤到二百余斤的山炮零件，翻过这野猪岭。
    行动了，三连一班副姜述平同志首先和其他同志抬上了二百二十斤重的大架，并将最重的一头放到了自己的肩上，其他的同志，也纷纷互相抬的抬，扛的扛，拉的拉，拥的拥，一步一步的向野猪岭山顶走去。两腿象压上百来斤的重量，没走几步汗就沿着面颊滴下来，混身上下被汗水湿透了，有的人被过重的零件压倒了，但他们不啃不吭的猛拉一把丛草，又站了起来继续前进。六连七班的刘福文，被一百九十余斤重的滑板压倒了，膝盖碰破了，鲜血流在脚背上，但他没理会这些，爬起来把滑板扛上肩继续的向前走。终于，大家胜利的登上了最高峰。
    在山巅上，炮兵们擦拭着脸上的汗，愉快的高喊着：“革命战士意志坚，同心合力往上搬，歼灭残匪敌，解放大福建！”接着，又鼓起勇气，顺着坡路，抬下山来。谁也没叫苦，因为谁都明确的记得：“今天的艰苦，就是将来的光荣。”在野猪岭的另一山脚下，炮兵们望着几乎被自己的汗沾湿了的山炮，胜利的笑了，异口同声的说：“困难被我们战胜了！”
