The victorious advance into Guangdong
Guan Jun
High mountains cannot stop the iron-like torrent. The powerful People's Liberation Army, stepping over the Five Ridges mountain range and climbing countless cliffs, steep slopes, and deep forests, is victoriously marching into Guangdong.

On the Gan-Yue Highway, dust flies everywhere along the hundreds of miles stretching from Ganzhou to Qujiang, and joyful songs float everywhere. Our troops are heading to Guangzhou, the last major port entrenched by the Kuomintang bandit gang, with rapid strides. American-style trucks, fully loaded with military supplies and heavy weapons, speed past the infantry marching south. The encouraging words broadcast from the propaganda booths along the road and the megaphones mixed in the ranks constantly strike the hearts of the soldiers. In this giant current of hundreds of miles long composed of excitement and strength, every commander and combatant utters a heroic vow from the bottom of their hearts: advance bravely and quickly complete our great historical march!

The southward advancing troops stepped into the gateway of Guangdong – Meiling Pass. When the boundary marker between Jiangxi and Guangdong came into view, a thunderous cheer suddenly erupted in the ranks: "Look! We've reached Guangdong!" Countless flags of the People's Liberation Army and the heroic award flags of various heroic units fluttered in the wind on the summit of Meiling Pass, reddening half of the sky's clouds. Look, there is the award flag of "Three Advances Across the South of the Yangtze River"; "Three Advances Across the South of the Yangtze River," there are the "Heroic Company" and "Steel Company" that fought in the Liaoxi-Shenyang Campaign, followed by "Victorious Entry into the Pass" and "Model for Going South." The combat heroes and people's meritorious servants could not help but excitedly and joyfully stroke the various dazzling medals hanging on their chests. The glory of victory appeared on their resolute faces, and they patted their chests in unison, confidently guaranteeing: "Let us bring glory to Guangdong!"

The megaphone sounded again: "Comrades, please remember! Today is September 30th, and tomorrow will be October. On the first day of heroic October, we entered Guangdong." Everyone listened to this meaningful broadcast and immediately recalled the heroic October of last year, when the People's Liberation Army swept across the Northeast, annihilating the remaining bandit troops of the Kuomintang bandit gang in Northeast China. Heroic October, the enemy trembled upon hearing it, but for the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, it was a force to encourage progress. It is indeed a coincidence that last October we liberated the entire Northeast, laying the foundation for the liberation of the whole country, and the glorious task of marching into Guangzhou and directly attacking the bandit's nest has fallen on the shoulders of the brave soldiers again in this October. The soldiers, full of confidence, encouraged each other: "Advance quickly! The faster we go, the faster we will achieve victory." Many people were counting on their fingers: if we walk twenty more miles each day, Guangzhou can be liberated a week earlier.

When the news of the founding of the People's Republic of China and the appointment of People's Leader Mao Zedong as Chairman of the Central People's Government reached the front, everyone forgot the fatigue of the journey and jumped up with excitement. Applause replaced firecrackers, and the slogans "Support the Central People's Government!" and "Support Chairman Mao!" surged like waves. All commanders and fighters vowed to defend the people's own country and completely annihilate all remaining bandits. A wave of combat competitions immediately unfolded among companies, platoons, and squads. The heroes were determined to celebrate the birth of the People's Republic of China with actual actions of annihilating a large number of enemies and rapidly liberating Guangzhou.

During the march of the army, the people of Guangdong, who had suffered under the Kuomintang bandit army, enthusiastically welcomed the People's Liberation Army with the infinite excitement and joy of being liberated. Women helped carry soil and repair roads. Along the way, every household boiled tea and delivered water, holding the soldiers' hands, accusing the Chiang bandit army of how they robbed their food, killed people, burned houses, and raped women when they fled, demanding that the soldiers quickly liberate the entire Guangdong. The soldiers gave them satisfactory answers. And now, these thousands upon thousands of people's soldiers who have been tempered through trials and hardships are overcoming the hot weather and other difficulties, regardless of fatigue and hardship, continuing to march towards Guangdong, fighting for the liberation of millions of compatriots who are still in dire straits. In carrying out this great historical mission, a soldier from a certain company even persevered through an 800-li march while ill.

Upon reaching Guangdong, our ranks expanded even more. The brotherly troops who persisted in the South China guerrilla war changed into neat uniforms and new weapons, closely joining hands with the field army, and marching shoulder to shoulder. When approaching ××, the commanders and fighters of the Second Field Army beat gongs and drums from afar to welcome the arrival of the Fourth Field Army's brother troops. Bowl after bowl of tea was delivered into the hands of the Fourth Field Army's commanders and fighters, cigarettes were put in their mouths, and bleached towels were used to wipe the sweat off the Fourth Field Army's comrades. The villagers, seeing this scene of friendly unity, revealed their infinite admiration and praise, saying: "Even real brothers are not this good!" These three brotherly troops have merged together, hand in hand, shoulder to shoulder, heading towards Guangzhou with great strength and will.

　　胜利进军广东
    冠军
    高山阻挡不住钢铁般的洪流。强大的人民解放军，踏过五岭山脉，攀越无数悬崖陡岭和深山密林，胜利地向广东进军了。
    赣粤公路上，从赣州到曲江延伸数百里的长途，到处飞扬着尘土，到处飘荡着愉快的歌声。我们的队伍，以迅速的步伐，奔赴国民党匪帮踞盘下的最后一个大港口——广州。美式大卡车满载着军用物资和重武器，从正在迈步向南大进军的步兵身旁飞驰而过。大道两旁宣传队的鼓动棚和夹杂在行列里的广播筒所播送的激励的言词，不断地打进战士们的心坎。每一个指挥员战斗员在这兴奋和力量汇成的数百里长的巨流里，从内心里发出了英雄的誓言：奋勇前进，赶快完成我们历史的大进军！
    南进部队踏进广东的门户——梅岭关。当江西、广东的界碑赫然在望时，行列中突然掀起了一阵巨雷似的欢呼：“看哪！我们打到广东了。”无数面的人民解放军军旗和各个英雄部队的英雄奖旗在梅岭关山颠一齐迎风招展，映红了半个天空的云彩。看吧，那是三下江南的奖旗：“三下江南”，那是辽西会战中打出的“英雄连”和“钢铁连”，跟着而来的是“胜利入关”和“南下模范”。战斗英雄们和人民功臣们不禁兴奋而愉快地抚着挂在胸前各种光耀夺目的奖章，胜利的光辉呈现在沉毅的脸庞上，他们不约而同地拍拍胸膛，满有信心地保证：“让我们把光荣带到广东！”。
    广播筒又响了：“同志们，请记住！今天是九月三十日，明天便是十月。英雄的十月，第一天我们就进入广东。”大家倾听了这意义深长的广播，马上回忆起去年英雄的十月，人民解放军席卷东北，全歼东北国民党匪帮残余匪军的情景。英雄的十月，敌人听了发抖，对于人民解放军的战士，则是鼓舞前进的力量。真凑巧，去年十月我们解放全东北，替解放全国奠定了基础，而进军广州，直捣匪巢的光荣任务，又在今年的十月落到英勇战士们身上来。战士们充满信心互相勉励着：“快前进啊！走的越快，胜利得越快。”不少人在屈指计算：每天多走二十里，广州就可以早解放一星期。
    当中华人民共和国成立，人民领袖毛泽东为中央人民政府主席的消息传到前方时，大家忘掉旅途的疲劳，兴奋得跳了起来。掌声代替鞭炮，“拥护中央人民政府！”“拥护毛主席！”的口号，如波涛澎湃，彼落此起。全体指战员起誓保卫人民自己的江山，彻底歼灭全部残余匪帮。各连队各班排间立即展开战斗竞赛的热潮，英雄们都决心以大量歼敌，迅速解放广州的实际行动来庆贺中华人民共和国的诞生。
    在大军的进军途中，受尽国民党匪军蹂躏的广东人民都以获得解放后无限兴奋愉快的热情，热烈地欢迎着人民解放军。妇女们帮着挑土、修补公路，沿途家家户户烧茶送水，拉着战士们的手，控诉蒋匪军溃逃时怎样抢光了他们的食物，杀人，烧房子，强奸妇女的罪行，要求战士们很快地解放全广东。战士们给了他们满意的回答。而现在，这上千上万的经过千锤百炼的人民战士，就是在克服着天气酷热和其他种种的困难，不顾疲劳和辛苦，在向广东继续进军，为解放千百万尚在水深火热之中的同胞而奋战。在执行这一伟大历史任务中，某连一个战士，甚至带病坚持了八百里的行军。
    到广东，我们的队伍更加扩大了。坚持华南游击战争的兄弟部队，换上整齐军装和新武器，和野战军亲密携手，并肩行进。快到××时，第二野战军的指战员很远就敲打着锣鼓，在欢迎四野兄弟部队的到来了。一碗一碗的茶水送到四野指战员们的手里，香烟送到嘴上，还用漂白的毛巾来给四野的同志们擦汗。老乡们看见这种友爱团结的情形，流露出无限钦佩与赞扬的语调说：“亲兄弟也没有这样好啊！”这三支兄弟部队汇合一起，正在手携着手，肩靠着肩，以强大的力量和意志，奔向广州。　　　　　　　　　　【新华社华中前线十一日电】
