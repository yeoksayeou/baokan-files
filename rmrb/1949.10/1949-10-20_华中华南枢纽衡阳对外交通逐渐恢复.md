　　Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 19th: External water, land, postal, and telecommunications transportation in Hengyang City, the transportation hub between Central and Southern China, are gradually recovering thanks to the active efforts of transportation workers. The Yuehan Railway south of Hengyang has been opened to Guanyinqiao Station, with one train running in each direction daily. The highways from Hengyang to Changsha and Qiyang have been opened to traffic successively. Xiang River shipping has long been unimpeded. Postal and telecommunications services have been restored with various liberated areas, and long-distance telephone service has also been connected with the newly liberated Qujiang, Hengshan, Baoqing, and Shaoyang. Hengyang railway workers waged a heroic struggle against the sabotage and looting conspiracy of the Bai bandit Chongxi against railway equipment, preserving a large amount of railway equipment and materials for the people. After liberation, they immediately launched rescue and repair work. For example, when the bandits were destroying the No. 1170 locomotive shed, stoker Zheng Daofu and locomotive driver Huang Chengdong, deceiving the sappers who were installing explosives, drove the locomotive out of the shed and escaped to a siding on the riverbank. When workshop worker Zhang Qinglu and others were helping the bandits move explosives, they secretly cut the fuse and removed some detonators. As a result, none of the seventeen boxes of explosives in the workshop exploded, and all the machines in the workshop were preserved.

　　华中华南枢纽衡阳对外交通逐渐恢复
    【新华社长沙十九日电】华中和华南间的交通枢纽衡阳市的对外水陆邮电交通，在交通员工积极努力下正逐步恢复。粤汉铁路衡阳以南已通至观音桥车站，每日对开列车一次。衡阳通长沙和祁阳的公路已先后通车。湘江航运则早已畅通。邮电与解放区各地均已恢复，与新解放的曲江、衡山、宝庆、邵阳间的长途电话亦已通话。衡阳铁路工人曾与白匪崇禧对铁路设备所进行的破坏、抢运阴谋，作了英勇的斗争，为人民保存了大量铁路器材设备，解放后并立即展开抢修工作。如一一七○号机车是当匪徒正在进行毁坏车房时，司炉郑道富和机车夫黄承栋朦哄着正在按装炸药的工兵，开出了车房，逃到江岸的岔道上的。车房工友张庆禄等在帮助匪徒搬炸药时，偷偷把导火线剪断并抽掉一些雷管，因而车房上的十七箱炸药一箱也没爆炸，车房全部机器均获保全。
