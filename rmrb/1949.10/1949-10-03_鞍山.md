　　[Our correspondent's dispatch from Anshan, dated the 1st] When the news that Mao Zedong was elected Chairman of the Government and the Central Government was proclaimed reached Anshan last night, the workers immediately took to the streets, beating drums and gongs, shouting "Long live Chairman Mao!" The Municipal Party Committee's propaganda trucks immediately spread the good news throughout the city. More than 600 boarding students at Xinhua Middle School lit torches, raised the newly made five-star national flag, and performed Yangko dances, holding a night parade. Today, before dawn, the sound of drums and gongs resounded everywhere, huge portraits of Chairman Mao were hung everywhere, and words praising Chairman Mao and the Communist Party were written everywhere. People from all walks of life in the city are also actively preparing to participate in the mass rally and torch parade tomorrow to celebrate the victorious success of the CPPCC and to support the International Day of Struggle for Peace.
　　[Second dispatch] Today, on the International Day of Struggle for Peace, more than 30,000 working people in Anshan held a rally at the city stadium to celebrate the victorious success of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the official birth of the Central Government, and to oppose wars of aggression and support world peace. A grand parade was held after the meeting, with the procession stretching for several miles. The slogans "Down with Imperialism," "Oppose Wars of Aggression," and "Long Live the People's Republic" resounded through the sky.
