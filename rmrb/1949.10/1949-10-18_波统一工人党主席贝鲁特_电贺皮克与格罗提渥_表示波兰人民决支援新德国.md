　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 17th. Polish News Agency, 15th: Bolesław Bierut, Chairman of the Polish United Workers' Party, recently sent a telegram congratulating Wilhelm Pieck and Otto Grotewohl, Chairmen of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. The telegram stated: "On the occasion of the establishment of the German Democratic Republic and the election of Comrade Pieck as President and Comrade Grotewohl as Prime Minister, we, on behalf of the Polish working masses, extend our sincere congratulations to you, and wish you success in your work for the benefit of the German people and for the consolidation of peace. The establishment of the German Democratic Republic was made possible by the Soviet Union, led by the great Stalin, eliminating fascism, and by the rise of democratic forces within the German nation. The establishment of the German Democratic Republic is a major event in European history. It is an effective blow to Anglo-American imperialism, which is trying its best to divide Germany and turn West Germany into a military base against peace-loving nations.
    Polish workers remember that German anti-fascists, led by the heroic leader of the German proletariat, Ernst Thälmann, were the first victims of Nazi prisons and concentration camps. The German Democratic Republic is the result of the hard work of the best sons and daughters of the German people, who have never doubted the victory of the ideals of democratic progress over Nazi barbarism. The Polish nation welcomes the establishment of the German Democratic Republic. From now on, it will forever separate itself from the most harmful and shameful tradition of eastward expansion. It regards the Oder and Neisse Rivers as the borders of peace. Good neighborly relations between Poland and Germany are an indispensable contribution to the cause of world peace. They are one of the factors that frustrate the conspiracies of the warmongers who are igniting the flames of revisionism and chauvinism in order to achieve their new aggressive goals. We believe that the new Germany, a democratic and peaceful Germany, will become an important component of the world peace camp, with the invincible Soviet Union as its vanguard. In your struggle against reactionary forces and imperialist warmongers, and in your struggle for a united, independent, peaceful, and democratic Germany, you will surely receive the support and solidarity of the Polish working class and the Polish people."

　　波统一工人党主席贝鲁特
  　电贺皮克与格罗提渥
    表示波兰人民决支援新德国
    【新华社北京十七日电】波兰通讯社十五日讯：波兰统一工人党主席贝鲁特顷电贺德国统一社会党主席皮克与格罗提渥。电文称：值此德意志民主共和国成立及皮克同志当选总统与格罗提渥同志当选总理之际，我们谨代表波兰劳动群众向你们转达热诚的祝贺，并祝你们为德国人民的利益及为巩固和平而进行的工作得到成功。由于伟大的斯大林所领导的苏联消灭了法西斯，由于德意志民族内民主力量的抬头，德意志共和国的成立才有可能，而德意志民主共和国的成立，是欧洲历史上的重大事件。它给予分裂德国统一竭力变西德为反对爱好和平民族的军事基地的英美帝国主义以有效打击。
    波兰工人记得：以德国无产阶级英勇的领袖昂斯特·台尔曼为首的德国反法西斯主义者，是纳粹牢狱与集中营的第一批牺牲者。德意志民主共和国是德国人民最优秀的子孙们努力奋斗的成果，他们从未怀疑过民主进步的理想对于纳粹野蛮的胜利，波兰民族欢迎德意志民主共和国的建立。它从此将永远与最有害的、可耻的向东方推进的传统分家。它把奥德河与尼斯河当作和平的边界。波兰与德国的善邻关系，对世界和平事业是不可或缺的贡献。它们是使战争挑拨者的阴谋破灭的因素之一。这些战争挑拨者为着实现其新的侵略目的而燃起修界主义与沙文主义之火。我们相信，新的德国，民主与和平的德国，将成为以无敌的苏联为其先锋的世界和平阵营内重要的组成部分。在你们反对反动势力与帝国主义战争贩子的斗争中，在你们为统一、独立、和平与民主的德国而进行的斗争中，你们一定会得到波兰工人阶级与波兰人民的支持与声援。
