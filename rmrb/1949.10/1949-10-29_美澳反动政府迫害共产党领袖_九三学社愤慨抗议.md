　　US-Australian Reactionary Governments Persecute Communist Leaders
　　The September 3rd Society Protests with Indignation
　　[Reported by this newspaper] The September 3rd Society issued a written protest against the persecution of Communist leaders by the US and Australian reactionary governments, as follows:
　　On October 14, 1949, the jury of the US Federal Court, following the dictates of Wall Street monopolists, insisted that the Communist Party of the United States was an agent of a foreign power, falsely accusing the Communist Party of the United States of attempting to subvert the government by violence, and sentenced ten members of the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States to five years in prison and a fine of $10,000 each, and one person to three years in prison and a fine of $10,000. The chairman of the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States, Foster, had already exposed the conspiracy of the reactionary US government. Progressive Party leader Wallace also told the press that "the history of Germany, Italy, Japan, and Franco's Spain should have taught us that suppressing the Communist Party is only the first step in attacking labor, minorities, racial minorities, and the democratic rights of political minorities, as well as all those who oppose the policies of the government in power." People all over the United States and the world are lodging stern protests against this atrocity.
　　On October 17 of the same year, the Supreme Court of Melbourne, Australia, also following the dictates of Wall Street monopolists, sentenced Australian Communist leader Sharkey to three years in prison on the charge of so-called treasonous speech, on the grounds that he had made a speech on March 5 of the same year opposing the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty and supporting the anti-war statement of French Communist leader Thorez. This has aroused angry protests from workers throughout Australia. The Central Committee of the Australian Communist Party has issued a special statement calling on the working class and all democrats to demand the release of Sharkey and the cancellation of his unreasonable sentence; pointing out that the sentence against Sharkey is part of the sinister plan to involve the Australian people in the anti-Soviet war being organized by the US ruling clique; this plan constitutes a serious threat to Australian national independence. British Communist Party General Secretary Pollitt has also lodged a strong protest with the Australian reactionary government on behalf of British progressives.
　　The members of the September 3rd Society, based on their consistent desire to safeguard international peace and promote the universal development of democracy and science in the world, cannot but stand on the side of the Chinese people and firmly protest against this shameless atrocity of the US and Australian reactionary governments, and solemnly point out the following:
　　1. The trial of the Communist leaders of the United States and Australia is a replay of the Reichstag fire case by Hitler. Fascism attempts to expand under the guise of anti-communism. It fabricates the non-existent "communist threat" to persecute the broad masses of people. It is now tearing off even the mask of bourgeois democracy, but still pretending to be the defender of the bourgeois democratic system. We must expose this shameless deception of the fascist bandits.
　　2. Organizing an anti-Soviet war has now been openly defined as "national policy" by the reactionary government, and opposing war has been designated as an act of "treason"; defending democracy and peace has now been designated as subverting the government by violence. The reactionary governments of all countries are actually war-mongering groups. The peace-loving people of all countries in the world cannot but be highly vigilant against every move of the reactionary governments of their respective countries, and cannot but further shatter all anti-Soviet and anti-communist conspiracies.
　　3. The criminal activities of the reactionary governments of all countries in opposing communism and the Soviet Union are all in accordance with the dictates of Wall Street monopolists. Wall Street monopolists are the culprits who endanger peace, create wars, destroy democracy, and rebuild the bloody rule of fascism. Wall Street monopolists themselves treat foreign reactionary governments as their agents abroad, but falsely accuse the Communist parties of all countries, who truly love their countries and people and defend peace and democracy, of being agents of foreign countries. They have reached the height of shamelessness. Only by uniting as one and fundamentally shattering this shameless conspiracy of Wall Street monopolists can the people of the world obtain true democracy and lasting peace.
　　Because of the above three points, we have recognized the crimes of the Wall Street monopolists, but we must not be frightened by them. The danger of fascism in power can be repelled by the power of the people, and the criminal activities of organizing an anti-Soviet war can be stopped. The American people's understanding of Wall Street monopolists is clearer than that of the people of any other country, and the people of other countries also understand that only the reactionary governments of their respective countries are Wall Street's agents abroad. The Soviet Union and the new democratic countries have stood firm as bulwarks of world peace and democracy. The Chinese people have stood up, let the Wall Street monopolists tremble! We must also rise up in time, unite and strive to fundamentally shatter the power of Wall Street monopolists. We solemnly warn the US and Australian reactionary governments to immediately cancel the crimes of persecuting the leaders of the US and Australian Communist Parties and any of their members!

### 美澳反动政府迫害共产党领袖  九三学社愤慨抗议

　　美澳反动政府迫害共产党领袖　
    九三学社愤慨抗议
    【本报讯】九三学社对美澳反动政府迫害共产党领袖一事发表书面抗议如下：
    一九四九年十月十四日，美国联邦法院陪审团，遵奉华尔街独占资本家的意旨，硬说美国共产党是外国的代理机关，诬称美国共产党企图以暴力颠覆政府，判处美国共产党全国委员会十人各五年徒刑，一万美元罚金，一人三年徒刑，一万美元罚金。美共全国委员会主席福斯特早已揭破了美国反动政府的阴谋。美国进步党领袖华莱士也向报界发表谈话，指出“德国、义大利、日本和佛朗哥、西班牙的历史，应已教训我们镇压共产党只是进攻劳工、进攻少数民族，少数种族、和政治上的少数派，以及一切反对当权政府的政策者的民主权利的第一步。”全美及全世界人民对于此种暴行正纷纷提出严正的抗议。
    同年十月十七日澳大利亚的墨尔本最高法院，也同样遵奉华尔街独占资本家的意旨，以澳共领袖夏基曾于同年三月五日，发表谈话，反对侵略性的北大西洋公约，支持法共领袖多列士的反战声明为由，按所谓发表叛国言论罪，判处三年徒刑。全澳工人已因此激起愤怒的抗议运动。澳共中央委员会已发表特别声明，号召工人阶级与一切民主人士要求释放夏基，并取消对他的无理的判决；指出对夏基的判决，是将澳大利亚人民卷入正在由美国统治集团组织之反苏战争的罪恶计划的一部分；这个计划，已构成对澳洲民族独立的严重威胁。英共总书记波立特亦已代表英国进步人士对澳大利亚反动政府提出强烈的抗议。
    九三学社社员本其保卫国际和平，促进民主与科学在世界普遍发展的一贯意愿，不能不站在中国人民的立场，对美澳反动政府此种无耻暴行，坚决提出抗议，并郑重指明下列各点：
    一、对美澳共产党领袖的审判，就是希特勒国会纵火案的再版。法西斯主义企图在反共的掩饰下寻求扩展。它虚构了根本不存在的“共产主义的威胁”迫害广大的人民。它现在连资产阶级民主的假面具也要撕毁，却还假装着它是资产阶级民主制度的保卫者。我们要揭穿法西斯匪徒这一无耻的欺骗。
    二、组织反苏战争，现已被反动政府公开定为“国策”，反对战争已被指为“叛国”行为；保卫民主和平，现已被指为以暴力颠覆政府，各国反动政府，实际就是战贩集团。全世界各国爱好和平的人民，不能不对各该国反动政府的每一举动提高警觉，不能不更进一步粉碎一切反苏反共阴谋。
    三、各国反动政府反共反苏的罪恶活动，都是遵奉华尔街独占资本家的意旨的，华尔街独占资本家就是危害和平制造战争，破坏民主，再建法西斯主义血腥统治的罪魁祸首。华尔街独占资本家自己把外国反动政府当作它在外国的代理机关，反而诬称各国真正爱护国家人民保卫和平民主的共产党是外国的代理机关，实已无耻到了极点。全世界人民只有一致团结，根本粉碎华尔街独占资本家这种无耻阴谋，才有可能获得世界真正的民主和永久的和平。
    由于以上三点，使我们认清了华尔街独占资本家的罪恶，却决不能因此骇倒我们。法西斯主义当权的危险，用人民的力量是可能击退的，组织反苏战争的罪恶活动，是可能制止的。美国人民对华尔街独占资本家的认识，比任何一国的人民，都清楚些，其他各国人民，也都懂得只有各该国反动政府才是华尔街在外国的代理机关，苏联及新民主各国已经屹立不摇地成为世界和平民主的堡垒，中国人民已经站立起来，让华尔街独占资本家们发抖吧！我们还要及时奋起，团结努力根本粉碎华尔街独占资本家的势力，我们严正警告美澳反动政府立即取销迫害美澳共产党领袖及其任何党员的罪行！
