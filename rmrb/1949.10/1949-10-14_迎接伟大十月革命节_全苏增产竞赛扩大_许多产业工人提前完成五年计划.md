　　Welcoming the Great October Revolution Day
    All-Soviet Production Increase Competition Expands
    Many Industrial Workers Complete the Five-Year Plan Ahead of Schedule
    【Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 13th】TASS Moscow dispatch: The 32nd anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution is approaching, and the all-Soviet scale socialist competition is expanding more and more. Industrial workers are striving to shorten the time to complete tasks and undertake higher new tasks.
    Personnel from the Podolsk (south of Moscow) cable factory decided to complete the Five-Year Plan in terms of output on October 1st (instead of November 7th), but they fulfilled this guarantee on September 28th. Steelworkers in Moscow, the Urals, Ukraine, and Siberia have increased the number of rapid smelting operations and overproduced thousands of tons of metal beyond the plan. In the steel industry, the original time for melting heavy castings was six hours, but Peter Saika, a famous steel smelter at the Verkhisetsk Steel Plant, now only needs four hours and two minutes, which is an unprecedented new record, and a few days later he shortened the time by another five minutes. Workers and engineers in Leningrad are also working hard to produce a large number of items for the Soviet steel industry and power stations ahead of schedule in commemoration of the October Revolution Day. This year, textile workers in Ivanovo Oblast have also fulfilled their guarantee, saving 860 tons of cotton and 1,600 tons of yarn, and using the saved materials to produce 27 million meters of fabric.
    Many enterprises in Belarus have reported that they have completed this year's plan ahead of schedule. Grigory Klimov (a mechanic at the Vitebsk Machine Manufacturing Plant) has completed 21 years of production quotas since the start of the post-war Five-Year Plan. More than 5,000 youth work teams have completed their Five-Year Plans. Armenian factories and workshops are working with the greatest enthusiasm, and thousands upon thousands of Stakhanovite movement participants have completed their Five-Year Plans. In Lithuania, more than 5,000 working men and women have completed their one-year plans ahead of schedule and are now producing products for 1950. Lithuanian industry has mastered the method of using more than 100 new production systems to engage in large-scale production. All this reflects the patriotism of the Soviet people, reflecting their desire to make their country stronger and more prosperous.

　　迎接伟大十月革命节
    全苏增产竞赛扩大
    许多产业工人提前完成五年计划
    【新华社北京十三日电】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：伟大十月社会主义革命三十二周年纪念即将来临，全苏规模的社会主义竞赛正愈益扩大中。产业工人力求缩短完成任务的时间，并承担起更高的新任务。
    波多尔斯克（莫斯科以南）电缆制造厂的人员曾决定：要在十月一日（而不是十一月七日）在产量上完成五年计划，但他们在九月二十八日就实现了这一保证。莫斯科、乌拉尔、乌克兰、和西伯利亚的钢铁工人已增加了快速熔炼的数目，并超计划生产了数千吨金属。钢铁工业中熔铸重型铸造物，原定的时间是六小时，而维尔契塞茨克钢铁厂有名的熔钢工人彼特·萨伊卡，现在只需时四小时零二十分钟，这已是空前的新纪录，而在几天之后他又缩短了五分钟的时间。列宁格勒的工人和工程师，为了纪念十月革命节，也正努力提早制成供苏联钢铁工业及电力站应用的大批物品。今年伊凡诺伏州的纺织工人也实现了他们的保证，已节省了八百六十吨棉花和一千六百吨纱，并用节省下的材料生产了二千七百万公尺织物。
    白俄罗斯许多企业都已报告提前完成了今年一年的计划。格里哥里·克利莫夫（威得比斯克机器制造厂的机工），自战后五年计划开始以来，已完成了二十一年的生产定额。五千多队青年工作队已完成了他们的五年计划。亚美尼亚工厂与作坊正以最大的热情来从事劳动，成千成万的斯塔哈诺夫运动者完成了五年计划。立陶宛有五千多个劳动男女已提前完成一年计划，现在正生产着一九五○年的出品。立陶宛工业已掌握了用一百多新的生产系统来从事大规模生产的方法。这一切都反映着苏联人民的爱国主义，反映着他们要使他们的国家更加富强的热望。
