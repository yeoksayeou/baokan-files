　　In the square of the industrial section of the Dalian Industrial Exhibition, there is a brand-new 33-ton molded electric boat built by learning from the Soviet Union, as well as sections of ship skin explaining the process of molded shipbuilding. The molded steel cast anchor, first created in Lushun-Dalian, is also on display here. Inside the shipbuilding hall are exhibits of newly built diesel engines of 120 horsepower and 90 horsepower, dissected boilers, ship repair and shipbuilding processes... On the walls are banners high above with the slogan "Learn from the Soviet Union, follow the path of the Russians." All of this shows that the Lushun-Dalian ship repair and shipbuilding industry has been restored and developed with the help of Soviet friends.
　　The shipbuilding industry constitutes a special position in the Lushun-Dalian area. This is because the excellent natural commercial port of Dalian Bay provides good conditions for the development of the ship repair and shipbuilding industry.
　　Starting from the northeast corner of the coast and heading west, many newly repaired and newly built huge merchant ships and electric boats are docked in Dalian Port. Towering chimneys on the shore spew black smoke, huge cranes are moving, and dazzling sparks are flying in the docks and workshops, mixed with the deafening sound of metal clashing. Workers are working with selfless spirit, and with the enthusiastic technical assistance of Soviet friends, new achievements are emerging every moment.
　　Let's take a look at how Dalian's shipbuilding industry has been restored and developed.
　　Let's start with the Dalian Ship Repair and Shipbuilding Plant (Ship Canal). Before August 15th, this factory had a maximum of 5,000 workers, with ten branches including ship repair, shipbuilding, machinery, and boilers. The factory's machinery and equipment were also relatively complete. In shipbuilding, although the factory could manufacture ship skins and over a thousand kinds of machine parts, larger ships could not sail unless they were towed to Japan for final assembly of main engine parts such as cylinders and connecting rods. This is precisely the characteristic of colonial industry. After August 15th, we took over the factory, which was then at a standstill: the chimneys were not smoking, and the machines were not running. Such an industry could not be allowed to stagnate; we had to restore it and develop it. However, at the end of 1946 and the beginning of 1947, a large number of Japanese technicians returned to their country. Old riveting workers with 20 or 30 years of experience still only knew how to handle rivets. From the end of 1946 to the first half of 1948, the Kuomintang reactionaries blockaded the Lushun-Dalian area from the sea and land, and raw materials and fuel could not be brought in for a while. However, difficulties could not overwhelm the brave and hardworking Chinese people. When our great Soviet friends brought raw materials and advanced technology from socialist countries from afar to the factory, the difficulties were solved. In the short span of four years, we have created things that the Japanese invaders had not created in forty years of rule: molded ships, steel cast anchor chains, and other products can also be exhibited at the Industrial Exhibition.
　　Let's take ship repair work as another example. In 1948, the output exceeded the highest output during the Japanese occupation from 1936 to before liberation, and was nearly 200,000 tons higher than the average output of the Japanese invaders. Taking 1946 as 100 percent, the total ship repair and shipbuilding production performance reached 176 percent in 1948, and is expected to reach 260.7 percent this year. Shi Yingzhou, the worker-turned-director of the ship repair branch, explained this issue in terms of the repair progress of each ship. He first used the "Eishun Maru," which had the highest ship repair efficiency during the Japanese administration, to illustrate that when the hull was damaged with four hundred square meters of flat plates (flat plates are easy to repair, curved plates are laborious), more than four hundred people worked day and night, and it took four and a half months to repair. During our administration, when the "Kavkas" entered the dock in 1946, the damaged area was 360 square meters of curved plates, and 200 people repaired it in three and a half months. Later, another ship with 400 square meters of damaged curved plates was repaired by more than 200 people in one month. What a great progress this is! Last winter, the "Stalingrad," which was damaged by 570 square meters, was repaired in nine days with the participation of over a thousand workers. In terms of ship repair quality, Director Shi used the riveted iron plate on the ship to illustrate that according to general specifications, one out of every hundred rivets leaked, while now only seven out of six thousand rivets leak.
　　As for shipbuilding technology, it was very low during the Japanese administration. At that time, it took more than 80 workers three and a half months to build a 20-30 ton iron ship. To manufacture the hull, a trestle frame was erected, and iron plates were pieced together one by one upwards, which was time-consuming and laborious. When Soviet friends brought the drawings of the molded electric fire boat to the factory at the end of 1947, we used the advanced molded shipbuilding method. The efficiency of manufacturing a 33-ton electric boat was 35 times higher than in the past.
　　The steel cast anchor chains displayed in the shipbuilding hall have been manufactured since April last year. Currently, the factory has established a special anchor chain casting branch, and more than 60 workers have completely mastered the technology of making anchor chains. When the drawings for making chains were first shipped from the Soviet Union, veteran foundry workers with 20 or 30 years of experience not only couldn't make them, but hadn't even seen them before. Because during the Japanese administration, anchor chains were always forged one by one (this kind of anchor chain is easy to break because it is fired and has an interface), who would have seen 127 forged anchor chains poured out at once? The Soviet veteran foundry worker Balufinjack designed the sand box and adjusted the molten iron, and the anchor chain was poured out. The workers learned this brand-new technology in surprise. At the beginning, the technology was not skilled, and only six out of 115 anchor chains cast last year were good. This year, more than 90 percent of those made in August alone were good. Production efficiency has also increased sevenfold. The tensile force of the anchor chain has reached 150 tons from the specified 92 tons.
　　Now, the Dalian Ship Repair and Shipbuilding Plant has developed. As of August this year, the number of workers alone has increased to × thousand one hundred, and it will expand to × thousand by the end of this year. There are now 18 production branches. Soviet friends are doing their best to help expand the machinery and equipment. From the end of last year to June this year alone, more than 12,110 working machines of 23 types, including lathes, grinders, electric rollers, pneumatic drills, and electric drills, have been shipped from the Soviet Union, including 52 of the latest automatic lathes. In terms of factory management, 22 factory directors and more than 280 technicians, engineers, and other technical cadres have been promoted from among the workers. According to the factory's machinery, equipment, and manpower, steam engine parts and 10,000-ton ships can be manufactured here.
　　Another factory in the shipbuilding hall is the Lushun-Dalian Shipbuilding Company. It was originally formed by merging ten small ship repair and shipbuilding factories of Japanese merchants such as Morisaki, Suzuki, and Nishimori after we took them over. The factory's machinery and equipment are relatively simple and backward, and there are only × hundred workers. But despite this, in the past two years, thanks to the efforts of the workers, overcoming various difficulties, they have also built 5,000 tons of iron and wooden ships of around 100 tons. This year, 14 new 50-ton fishing boats will be built. The company has also newly established the First and Second Engine Manufacturing Plants. The diesel engines of varying horsepower, first created in Lushun-Dalian and exhibited in the shipbuilding hall, are the machines that these two factories are producing in large quantities. The factory is making plans to expand the factory, and next year it will manufacture cargo ships of over × thousand tons in the newly built factory.
　　In the above description, we have only introduced the outline of the Lushun-Dalian ship repair and shipbuilding industry. In fact, with the help of our Soviet friends, this industry is appearing on the front line of China's industrialization with a sound posture and high-speed development.

　　大连修船造船工业的恢复和发展
    大连工业展览会通讯  谷汀
    大连工业展览会工业门里的广场上，停放着一条崭新的、向苏联学习造成的三十三吨的胎造电船以及分成几段说明胎造船过程的船皮。旅大首创的胎造钢铸锚也排列在这里。造船馆内展览着一百二十匹马力和九十匹马力不等的新造柴油机、锅炉的解剖，修船和造船过程………。墙壁上高悬着“学习苏联，走俄国人的路”的标语。这一切，说明了旅大修造船工业是在苏联友人的帮助下恢复和发展起来的。
    造船工业在旅大地区构成了一种特殊地位。这是由于大连湾这个天然优良的商港，使修船造船工业的发展具备了良好的条件。
    从沿海的东北角起向西，大连港内停着许多新修好的、新造好的巨大商轮和电船。岸上高耸入云的烟囱吐着黑烟，巨大的吊车在走动，坞内和车间飞舞着耀眼的火光，同时又夹杂着震耳欲聋的铁器相击声。工人们以忘我的精神劳动着，在热情的苏联友人先进的技术帮助下，每时每刻都有新的成绩出现。
    请大家看一看大连造船工业是怎样恢复与发展起来的吧。
    我们先从大连修造船厂（船渠）说起。在“八一五”以前，这个厂最多时工人达到五千人，有修船、造船、机械、锅炉等十个分厂，厂内机械设备也比较完善。在造船上，虽然厂内可制造船皮和千余种机件。但是较大的船只如不拖到日本去最后装配汽缸、拉杆等主机件，就无法航行。这正是殖民地工业的特点。“八一五”后，我们接收了工厂，当时全厂是在停顿着：烟囱不冒烟，机器也不转动。这样的工业是不能让它停顿的，我们要恢复，要发展。但是，一九四六年底和一九四七年初，日本技术人员大批回国了。有了二、三十年工龄的老铆钉工人，还只会弄铆钉。一九四六年底到一九四八年上半年，美蒋反动派又从海陆上封锁了旅大地区，原料、燃料一时都进不来。可是，困难压不倒勇敢而勤劳的中国人民。当我们的伟大的苏联友人遥远地把原料、把先进的技术从社会主义国家带进厂来后，困难就迎刃而解了。在短短的四年中间，日寇统治四十年所未曾造出的东西，我们造成了：胎造船、钢铸锚链等制品也能在工展会场里展览了。
    再拿修船工作来说。一九四八年即超过一九三六年到解放前日寇统治时期的最高产量，比日寇的平均产量高出近二十万吨。修、造船总生产成绩以一九四六年作为百分之百，一九四八年就达百分之一百七十六，今年将达百分之二百六十点七。工人出身的修船分厂厂长施英洲，以每只船的修理进度来说明这个问题。他先拿日寇管理时代修船效率最高的“英顺丸”说明，船体坏了平板（平板好修，弯板费工）四百平方公尺，四百余人白天黑夜干，四个半月才修好。在我们管理时代，一九四六年“卡夫卡司号”进坞，破损处是弯板三百六十平方公尺，二百人三个半月就修好。之后，另一只破损弯板四百平方公尺的船，二百余人一个月就修好了。这该是一个多大的进步啊！去年冬天，一只破损了五百七十平方公尺的“斯大林格勒号”，在千余工人参加下九天就修好了。在修船质量上，施厂长用船上的铆铁板说明：按照一般规格，每一百个铆钉有一个漏水的，而现在铆六千个铆钉仅有七个漏水的。
    至于造船的技术，日寇管理时代是很低的。那时造一只二、三十吨的铁船，用上八十多个工人，三个半月才能作成。制造船身，则是竖起一个道梁架，把铁板一张张向上拚凑，耗时又费工。当一九四七年末苏联友人把胎造电火船图样拿到工厂以后，我们就使用了先进的胎造船法。制造三十三吨电船的效率，即比过去提高了三十五倍。
    造船馆内摆着的钢铸锚链，是从去年四月开始制造的。目前该厂已专门建立了铸造锚链分厂，六十余个工人已完全掌握造锚链的技术。当刚从苏联运来造链图样时，二、三十年的老翻砂工人不仅不会作，而且连见都没有见过。因为日寇管理时一直是一个一个＠的打锚链（这种锚链因为是用火烧，有一接口，很容易断），谁又看到一下就倒出一百二十七个＠的锚链呢？苏联老翻砂工人巴鲁芬杰克设计了砂箱，调剂了铁水，锚链就倒出来了。工人们在惊喜中学习着这崭新的技术。开始时技术不熟练，去年铸造一百十五条锚链，仅有六条好的。今年只八月份造的则是百分之九十以上都是好的。生产效率也提高了七倍。锚链的牵曳力由规定的九十二吨达到一百五十吨。
    现在，大连修、造船厂发展了。到今年八月份，仅工人就增加到×千一百余人，今年底将扩大到×千人。现在共有十八个生产分厂。苏联友人正尽力帮助扩大机器设备，仅去年底到今年六月，就从苏联运来车床、砂轮、电滚、风钻、电钻等二十三种，一万二千一百十余件工作机器，其中有最新式的自动车床五十二台。在工厂管理方面，已由工人中提拔了二十二个厂长和二百八十余名技师、技术员等技术干部。根据工厂的机器设备和人力，汽力机件和万吨大船都能从这里制造出来。
    造船馆的另一个厂是旅大造船公司。它原是日商森崎、铃木、西森等十一个小修造船厂被我接收后合并而成的。这个厂机器设备比较简陋与落后，工人也只有×百余人。但是尽管这样，过去两年在工人们的努力下，克服种种困难，也造出百吨上下的铁船和木船五千吨。今年将新造五十吨渔船十四只。该公司并新建立了第一和第二两个造机厂。造船馆内展览的马力大小不等旅大首创的柴油机，就是这两厂正在大量生产的机器。该厂正作着扩大工厂的计划，明年将在新修建的厂内，制造×千吨以上的货船。
    上面的叙述，我们只是介绍了旅大修船造船工业的轮廓。实际上，这一工业在我们的苏联友人的帮助下，正以健全的姿态、高速的发展，出现在新中国工业化的前线上。
