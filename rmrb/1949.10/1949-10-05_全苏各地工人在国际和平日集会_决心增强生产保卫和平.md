In Leningrad, 270,000 people gathered on the streets near the Winter Palace and on the large square across from the Neva River embankment, carrying portraits of Stalin adorned with flowers, and holding high banners defending world peace and democracy, and protesting the American and British warmongers. Workers, students, scientists, literary and art workers, and others successively delivered speeches at the meeting, condemning the instigators of a new war and expressing their determination to defend world peace. This solemn and magnificent square, the historically significant site of the October Revolution, was transformed into a forum for defending peace. The大会 passed a resolution stating: The working people of Leningrad wholeheartedly support world peace and the resolutions of the Soviet Peace Congress, and vow to consolidate the camp fighting for peace with all their strength.

Dubinin, a worker at the Leningrad Burzhets factory and a member of the Soviet Peace Congress, said at the factory's peace rally on the 1st: Stalin's peace policy leads our country forward along the path of constructive labor, and reliably safeguards the Soviet Union, keeping our people free from the danger of war. The more fruitful the labor of the Soviet people, the stronger the socialist Soviet state will be. He said: By International Peace Day, I will have completed my tenth year's production quota.
