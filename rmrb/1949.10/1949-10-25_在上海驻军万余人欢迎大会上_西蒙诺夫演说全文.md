Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 24th. The following is the full text of the speech delivered by Simonov, Acting Head of the Delegation of Soviet Cultural, Artistic, and Scientific Workers, at the welcome rally for over ten thousand representatives of the Shanghai Garrison of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the evening of the 18th of this month:

　　Dear Comrades!

　　I am honored to represent the Soviet cultural, artistic, and scientific workers in paying tribute to you, the commanders and fighters of the Third Field Army present here today! You bravely liberated Shanghai from enemy rule in the struggle for the freedom and independence of the Chinese people. I first mention Shanghai, which you liberated, because I am now with you in this city. But our delegation has been to Nanjing, and we know that Nanjing was also liberated from the enemy through your valiant fighting. We crossed the Yangtze River, and we also know that in April of this year, due to your courageous fighting, you forcibly crossed this great natural barrier in the face of the enemy, shattering all the plans of the enemies of the Chinese people. We have seen the great Chinese film "Millions of Soldiers Cross the Yangtze." We saw how valiantly you completed this historically significant crossing battle, we saw your faces filled with composure and determination to win during the battle, and we are even happier to be able to see you, these heroic comrades, again here today in Shanghai, liberated by your valiant fighting. We Soviets, whether now or in the past, have always been keenly concerned about the great struggle of the Chinese people, who, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, have now achieved such great victories in this long and arduous struggle. We know the entire course of this struggle, we know that in these great difficulties, the Chinese Communist Party has established, strengthened, and tempered its People's Liberation Army in the struggle to defend the interests of its Chinese nation. We know that the reason this army can become such a powerful force is that it truly represents the interests of the people, because it has always fought only for the people. And to fight the enemies of the people for the people – that is to say, to fight the enemies of culture for the people's culture, that is to say, to fight reactionary forces for progress, that is to say, to fight imperialists for equality among nations, that is to say, to protect the right of all mankind to strive for a better future, that is to say, to protect and promote cultural undertakings. That is why we Soviet cultural workers are particularly happy to be able to meet with soldiers like you here. We are particularly happy to meet you because we are deeply convinced that the Chinese People's Liberation Army, by liberating the great Chinese people from the oppression of the warlords and from the oppression of the imperialists who think that nations can never be equal, has not only won brilliant military victories but has also accomplished great cultural undertakings. The ordinary soldier of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, holding a gun, forcibly crossing the Yangtze River under fire, driving the imperialists, that is, the oppressors of the people, out of their country, these people are, in our view, cultural workers. We welcome this ordinary soldier in the great army, just as we welcome someone who is fulfilling a great cultural mission by standing at their small post. But it is not just this kind of wish that makes us Soviet cultural workers regard the Chinese People's Liberation Army as a force for promoting culture. We know that the Chinese People's Liberation Army itself is a cultural school, a school that educates millions of ordinary laborers who have put on military uniforms. We know that the soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army enter schools and training classes in their own ranks. We also know that after receiving this kind of military education, they become advanced people not only in military positions but also in peaceful positions, active participants in the construction of New Democratic China. This is very close and familiar to us Soviet cultural workers. Our Soviet army, which we love and are therefore proud of, has been a school of culture throughout its thirty years of existence. The soldier who is determined to defend the interests of the people should be an advanced person, should be a conscious, cultivated, and principled role model for others. When our Soviet army provides military education to its soldiers, it also constantly cares about improving their common cultural level, cares about them so that when these young people return to peaceful construction work after completing their service, they become people who have improved their culture in the army, who are able to actively build a new society. Therefore, it is not surprising that in our country, demobilized soldiers become representatives of rural soviets, collective farm representatives, tractor drivers, harvester drivers, that is, they become advanced people in the countryside. Therefore, it is not surprising that demobilized soldiers, after returning to factories and manufacturing plants, become excellent workers and technicians, pushing our industry forward. Therefore, it is not surprising that many demobilized soldiers go to technical schools and universities to study, to become teachers, agricultural technicians, and engineers. This is not surprising, because they have already become advanced people in the army, because they have already become accustomed to studying in the army, and after leaving the army, they simply continue what they have already laid the foundation for, continue their studies. In our Soviet society, the army and the people are as closely related as flesh and blood, it is an inseparable part of the people, that is to say, an inseparable part of the people's culture. It is strong because it is a military force; but at the same time, it is strong because it is a cultural force, a force with noble ideals and noble morals, and this is twice as strong as its military power. This is how our great Stalin has cultivated our army. Therefore, we Soviet cultural workers often enthusiastically participate in the life of our army, considering it an honor to help educate this army, because it is the most determined and loyal defender of culture, a flag-bearer who protects the cultural development of all mankind and shatters all attempts by reactionaries to hinder or stop this development. That is why this noble mission of educating a whole generation undertaken by the Chinese People's Liberation Army is close and familiar to us Soviet cultural workers, that is why we Soviet cultural workers, on behalf of millions of Soviet intellectuals, warmly and sincerely pay tribute to our dear comrades.

　　In April of this year, Soviet and Chinese representatives attended the World Congress of Defenders of Peace in Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia. While we were there, it was precisely the time when you comrades present here were crossing the Yangtze River and occupying Nanjing. And when the Prague Peace Congress received a telegram knowing that you had liberated Nanjing here, the chairman of the Congress, the Czech writer Derda, suspended the meeting and announced the news of the Chinese People's Liberation Army's capture of Nanjing. Upon hearing this news, everyone in the entire venue stood up and cheered, and did not sit down for half an hour. The progressive people from the seventeen countries who attended the meeting were so happy to hear this news. They applauded and cheered like this, and warmly congratulated their own comrades, the Chinese representatives. But why are the defenders of peace welcoming you soldiers when you are fighting? They welcome you because they understand that the victory of the People's Liberation Army will enable China to achieve complete liberation as soon as possible, and will enable China to establish a people's democratic regime. And a people's democratic regime is precisely the regime of the people, and the regime of the people truly desires peace throughout the world. The representatives of the Peace Congress celebrated your military victory because they knew that this victory was indispensable to rooting out the imperialists, and that this victory was indispensable to shattering the plans of the war-mongering American imperialists. They celebrate you because they know that your victory will make China a great unified country, bring it into the camp of peace defenders, and also strengthen this peace camp headed by the Soviet Union, making it more powerful and invincible. The representatives of the Peace Congress celebrated your victory because they knew that the victorious army of the Chinese people, the armies of the people's democratic countries, and the great Soviet army would not be tools of war, but a powerful weapon to defend world peace from the encroachments of war-mongers. We Soviets have seen a lot and experienced a lot in our lives. We know that your Chinese comrades have also undergone many trials. We know very well what imperialists are, what reactionaries are, and what war-mongers are. They can never deceive us. We do not believe their nice words, do not believe their so-called good intentions, because we know that if they cannot destroy peace, it does not mean that they have suddenly become peace-loving people. No, it just means that they are afraid to destroy peace. And they are afraid to destroy peace only because the camp of peace defenders is much stronger than the camp that provokes war, only because the people of their own countries have also stood up to oppose the bloody plans of the imperialists, only because when the great Soviet people, the great Chinese people, and the people of the people's democratic countries stand in the same camp to oppose the imperialists, their plans cannot be realized. The imperialists cannot destroy peace because we are stronger than them, because our struggle for peace relies on our firm belief in our own strength, and our firm belief in our own strength relies on our having a great people's army, which has full strength to defend peace. For the development of culture, nothing is more precious than peace. A peaceful life – this is a necessary condition for human survival. Peaceful construction – this is what the people of all countries building new societies hope for. That is why we Soviet cultural workers welcome you, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and regard you as one of the most powerful forces currently defending world peace. Long live the peace defenders and the advanced cultural force of the Chinese people – the Chinese People's Liberation Army! Long live Comrade Zhu De, Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese People's Liberation Army! Long live the Chinese Communist Party and its leader Comrade Mao Zedong, who established the Chinese People's Liberation Army! Long live the friendship between our two great, advanced peoples who promote world culture! Long live Comrade Stalin, the teacher and leader of the advanced people of the world!

　　在上海驻军万余人欢迎大会上
  　西蒙诺夫演说全文
    【新华社北京二十四日电】苏联文化艺术科学工作者代表团代理团长西蒙诺夫本月十八日晚间在中国人民解放军驻沪部队代表万余人的欢迎大会上的演说词，全文如下：亲爱的同志们！
    我很荣幸的能够在今天代表苏联文化艺术科学工作者向你们在座的第三野战军的指战员们致敬！你们在争中国人民自由和独立而进行的斗争中，英勇地从敌人统治下解放了上海。我首先谈到被你们解放的上海，是因为现在我和你们同在这一个城市。但我们代表团到过南京，我们知道南京也是由于你们的奋战从敌人手中解放的。我们渡过了长江，而我们也知道：你们在今年春天四月里由于你们的英勇善战在敌前强渡了这个巨大的天险，粉碎了中国人民的敌人的全部计划。我们曾看过中国伟大的影片百万雄师下江南。我们看到你们如何英勇地完成了这个有历史意义的渡江战斗，我们看见你们在战斗中间充满镇定和必胜决心的面容，同时我们更高兴的能够今天在这里，在由你们的奋战而获得解放的上海，再看到你们这些英勇的同志们。我们苏联人无论是现在或者过去，都经常热切地关怀着中国人民伟大的斗争，他们在这个长期的艰巨的斗争中，在中国共产党领导下，在毛泽东同志领导下，现在获得了如此伟大的胜利。我们知道这个斗争的全部过程，我们知道在这些巨大的困难当中，中国共产党已经在保卫自己中华民族的利益而进行的斗争中建立了、加强了、锻炼了自己的人民解放军。我们知道：这个军队之所以能成为这样强大的力量，是因为它是真正代表人民利益的，是因为它一直只是为了人民来打仗的。而为了人民向人民的敌人作战——这就是说为了人民的文化而向文化的敌人作战，这就是说为了进步而向反动势力作战，这就是说为了民族间的平等而向帝国主义者作战，这就是说保护全人类争取美满的未来的权利，这就是说保护和推进文化事业。这就是为什么我们苏联文化工作者对于能够和象你们这样一些军人在这里见面而特别高兴。我们特别高兴和你们见面，是因为我们深信：中国人民解放军把伟大的中国人民从军阀的压迫之下，从那些想着使民族间永远不能平等的帝国主义者的压迫之下解放出来，这样它就不仅获得了光辉的军事胜利，而且也完成了巨大的文化事业。中国人民解放军的普通战士，手里拿着枪，在火线下面强渡长江，从自己国家里把帝国主义者，也就是把人民的压迫者赶出去，这些人们在我们看来就是文化工作者。我们欢迎伟大军队里的这个普通的战士，就象欢迎站在自己渺小的工作岗位上完成伟大的文化使命的这样一种人一样。但是不仅仅是这样一种愿望才使得我们苏联文化工作者把中国人民解放军视为推进文化的一支力量。我们知道中国人民解放军自己本身就是一个文化学校，就是一个教育几百万穿上军装的普通劳动人们的学校。我们知道中国人民解放军的士兵在自己队伍里就是进了学校和训练班。我们也知道，受过了这种军事教育以后，他们不仅在军事岗位上而且在和平岗位上成为先进的人，成为新民主主义中国建设的积极的参加者。这个对于我们苏联文化工作者是非常亲近和熟悉的。我们所喜爱的，同时因此而感到骄傲的我们的苏联军队，在它存在的整个三十年中间，一直是文化的学校。这个立志要保卫人民利益的战士应当是先进的人，应当是有觉悟、有修养，对于别的人有原则的这样一种模范的人。我们苏联军队在给自己士兵进行军事教育的时候，同时也经常关心提高他们共同的文化水平，关心他们，使得他们这些年轻的人在服役期满回到和平建设工作中去的时候，成为在军队里提高了自己文化的人，成为能够积极建设新社会的人。因此就不必奇怪，在我们国家里，退伍的军人在乡村里成为乡村苏维埃代表，集体农场代表，拖拉机手，收割机手，也就是成为乡村里先进的人。因此就不必奇怪，退伍的军人回到工厂和制造厂以后，就成为优秀的工人和技师，把我们的工业向前推进。因此就不必奇怪，许许多多退伍军人去到技术专门学校和大学里学习，当教员、农业技师和工程师。这个不必奇怪，是因为他们在军队里已经成了先进的人，是因为他们在军队里已经习惯于学习，从军队里出来以后，他们只是继续他们已经有了基础的东西，继续自己的学习。在我们苏联社会里，军队和人民是血肉相关的，他是人民不可分割的一部分，也就是说是人民文化不可分割的一部分。它强大，因为他是军事力量；但同时它强大，也因为它是文化力量，是有高尚理想和高尚道德的力量，而这个还要比它军事的威力强两倍。我们伟大的斯大林就是这样培养我们的军队的。因此我们苏联文化工作者经常热烈地参加我们军队的生活，认为帮助教育这个军队是光荣的，因为它是文化的最坚决和最忠实的保卫者，是保护全人类文化发展而粉碎反动派妨碍或阻止这个发展的一切企图的旗手。这就是为什么中国人民解放军所从事的这种高尚的整代教育的使命，对于我们苏联文化工作者是亲近的、熟悉的，这就是为什么我们苏联文化工作者代表苏联几百万知识分子热烈地衷心地向我们亲爱的同志们致敬的原因。
    今年四月，苏联和中国代表都曾到捷克的京城布拉格出席全世界拥护和平大会。我们在那里的时候，就正是你们在座的同志们渡过长江占领了南京的时候。而当布拉格和平大会得到电报，知道你们在这里解放了南京的时候，大会主席捷克的作家德尔达就中止会议，宣布了中国人民解放军夺取南京的消息。听到这个消息以后，全会场的人都站起来欢呼，有半个钟头没有坐下来。到会的十七个国家的进步人们就是这样高兴地听到这个消息。他们就是这样地鼓掌欢呼，就是这样热烈地祝贺他们自己的同志——中国代表们。但是你们打仗，为什么和平的拥护者反倒欢迎你们这些士兵呢？他们欢迎你们，是因为他们了解：人民解放军的胜利将使中国早日获得全部解放，将使中国建立人民民主政权。而人民民主政权正是人民的政权，人民的政权就是真正热望全世界的和平的。拥护和平大会的代表们庆祝你们军事的胜利，是因为他们知道：这个胜利是根绝帝国主义者所必不可缺的，这个胜利是粉碎美帝国主义者战争贩子的计划所必不可缺的。他们庆祝你们是因为他们知道：你们的胜利将使中国成为一个伟大的统一的国家，使它进入和平拥护者的阵营，同时也将加强以苏联为首的这个和平阵营，使得它更加有力，更加不可战胜。拥护和平大会的代表庆祝你们的胜利，是因为他们知道：获得胜利的中国人民的军队和人民民主国家的军队以及伟大的苏联军队将不是战争的工具，而是保卫全世界和平不受战争贩子侵害的一种强有力的武器。我们苏联人曾看见过很多东西，在自己生活中也曾体验过很多东西。我们知道，你们中国的同志也同样经过许多的考验。我们很清楚地知道，帝国主义者是什么东西，反动派是什么东西，战争贩子是什么东西。他们什么时候也欺骗不了我们。我们不相信他们好听的词句，不相信他们所谓善良的意图，因为我们知道，如果他们不能够破坏和平，这并不是说他们一下子就变成了爱好和平的人。不是的，这只是说，他们没有破坏和平，是因为他们害怕破坏和平。而他们害怕破坏和平，只是因为拥护和平的阵营比较挑拨战争的阵营强大得多，只是因为他们自己国家的人们也站起来反对帝国主义者血腥的计划，只是因为当伟大的苏联人民、伟大的中国人民和人民民主各国的人民站在同一阵营里来反对帝国主义者的时候，他们的计划是无法实现的。帝国主义者不能够破坏和平，是因为我们比他们强大，是因为我们争取和平的争斗是依靠于我们坚信我们自己的力量，而我们坚信我们自己的力量则又是依靠于我们有伟大的人民的军队，他们是有充分力量来保卫和平的。对于文化的发展，没有任何东西比和平宝贵。和平的生活——这是人类生存的必然的条件。和平建设——这是建设新社会的各国人民所希望的。这就是为什么我们苏联文化工作者欢迎你们中国人民解放军，把你们当作目下保卫全世界和平的最强大的力量中间的一个。和平保卫者和中国人民先进的文化力量——中国人民解放军万岁！中国人民解放军总司令朱德同志万岁！建立起中国人民解放军的中国共产党和它的领袖毛泽东同志万岁！我们两个伟大的、先进的、推进世界文化的人民的友谊万岁！全世界先进人民的导师和我们的领袖斯大林同志万岁！
