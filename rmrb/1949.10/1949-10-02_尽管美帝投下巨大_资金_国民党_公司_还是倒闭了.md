Despite Huge "Funds" Invested by U.S. Imperialism, the Kuomintang "Company" Still Went Bankrupt

　　The Kuomintang government is publishing anti-Soviet statements here because it is attempting to deceive its domestic and world public opinion, portraying things as if its collapse and bankruptcy were caused by some external foreign force, rather than by those truly domestic, profound forces determining China's destiny, the conflict of Kuomintang supporters, and the victory of the Chinese people.

　　Vyshinsky said that the Kuomintang representatives attempted to conceal the shameful failure of the Kuomintang warlords with the so-called slander of Soviet interference in China's internal affairs. But who can believe that there is anything serious in these slanders, saying that the great historical process taking place in a large country with nearly 500 million people can be explained as the result of the influence of some external force, due to some so-called reason that put the Kuomintang in a miserable situation? Isn't the absurdity of raising the question like this clear?

　　The Soviet representative then pointed out that the White Paper recently published by the U.S. State Department, which analyzes the reasons for the failure of the U.S. policy toward China, shows that all these aid, all these millions of dollars of U.S. taxpayers' money, resulted in complete collapse. The vast funds invested in the Kuomintang "company" at the expense of the interests of the American people did not save this company from complete bankruptcy.

　　Despite the great efforts and money spent to save the Kuomintang government from failure, this "company" still went bankrupt. This failure was prepared and realized by the Chinese people themselves, who demonstrated their power and deep dedication to the cause of national liberation.

    尽管美帝投下巨大“资金”国民党“公司”还是倒闭了
    国民党政府在这里发表反苏的言论，是因为它企图欺骗它国内的舆论和世界的舆论，把事情描写得好象它的崩溃和破产是由于某些外来的外国的力量所造成，而不是由于那些真正国内的决定中国命运的深刻的力量、国民党支持者的冲突和中国人民的胜利。
    维辛斯基说，国民党代表企图以所谓苏联干涉中国内政的谰言，来掩饰国民党军阀的可耻失败。但是，对于这些谰言，说什么在一个几乎拥有五万万人口的大国所正在发生的伟大历史进程，能够解释为由于某些外来力量的影响，由于某种所谓使国民党陷于悲惨境地的原因的影响所造成的后果的这种谰言，有谁能相信其中还会有什么严肃性呢？这样提问题的荒唐可笑，难道还不清楚吗？
    苏联代表继而指出，美国国务院最近发表的分析美国对华政策失败原因的白皮书显示：所有这些援助，美国纳税人的所有这些多少百万元的款项的花费，结果却是完全的崩溃。牺牲美国人民的利益而投入国民党“公司”的浩大资金，并没有挽救了这家公司，使免于完全破产。
    尽管使用了很大的力量和钱财去挽救国民党政府的失败，这家“公司”还是倒闭了，这个失败是中国人民自己所准备和实现了的，中国人民表现出他们的威力和深深热心于民族解放的主张。
