Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 17th. The Northeast State-Owned Ball Bearing Factory has achieved initial success in researching and manufacturing the round steel balls necessary for general machinery, making a significant contribution to the industrial construction of the Northeast. Since September, the factory has produced more than 26,000 fully qualified steel balls and is now preparing for mass production. During the Japanese puppet regime of Manchuria, the factory was actually only a ball bearing assembly plant, unable to manufacture its own steel balls. Since the People's Government took over, it has mobilized employees to find ways to create them. Starting in April of this year, Jin Deyuan, director of the factory's ball manufacturing plant, and Song Shifa, foreman of the ball grinding team, led workers and apprentices in careful research, undergoing more than 600 repeated experiments before achieving initial success. At the same time, workers Ma Hongtu and Xu Wanjin jointly designed and manufactured the embryos of wave-shaped and basket-shaped ball retainers.

　　东北工业建设一大贡献
  　国营滚珠轴承工厂研究制造钢珠成功
    【新华社沈阳十七日电】东北国营滚珠轴承工厂，研究制造一般机器上所必需的圆形钢珠已获得初步成功，对东北工业建设贡献颇大。该厂自九月份开始已制出完全合乎规格的钢珠二万六千余枚，现正准备大量生产中。该厂在伪满时，实际上只是一个滚珠装配，自己不能制造滚珠，自经人民政府接管后，即发动职工设法创造。今年四月开始，由该厂滚珠厂主任金德源和磨珠班长宋世发两位老工友率领工徒进行精心研究，前后经过六百余次的反复试验，始获初步成功。与此同时，该厂工人马鸿图、徐万金等共同设计与制造了浪形与筐形滚珠保持器的胚胎。
