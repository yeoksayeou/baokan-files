    The Research Object, Task, and Characteristics of Political Economy
    Chapter 1 Mode of Production
    Section 1 Productive Forces
    As for cooperation in capitalist society, it presupposes the concentration of means of production in the hands of capitalists and the existence of free wage labor. The scope and scale of cooperation depend on the degree of concentration of means of production in the hands of capitalists and the size of the capital used by capitalists to purchase labor power. Therefore, under the capitalist mode of production, the productive forces developed by laborers in the form of cooperation, Marx believed, are "expressed as the productive power of capital, and cooperation itself is also expressed as a special form of the capitalist production process, in contrast to the production process of scattered independent laborers and small employers." (Capital, Volume 1, Part 4, Chapter 11). In the new democratic society, simple cooperation is initially based on the principle of voluntary mutual benefit and equivalent exchange, where laborers own the means of production. It is a collective labor organization where laborers voluntarily and equally combine and help each other, and it is the seed of large-scale collective production. In the later stage, it will develop into collective ownership of the means of production due to the improvement of productive forces, and transition to socialism on this basis. In socialist society, it is based on the social or state ownership of the means of production, and follows the principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work," which is the basic form of socialist large-scale collective production. This is a general overview of the development of the history of simple cooperation. The development of cooperation itself, along with the development of productive forces caused by cooperation, also progresses from simple to complex, that is, from simple cooperation to complex cooperation.

    Division of Labor—Complex Cooperation, Can Greatly Improve Productivity

    Division of labor (some call it division of industry or division of work) is another form of labor organization, also a type of cooperation, also called complex cooperation. Because cooperation is the combination of many people to jointly undertake a task. Division of labor is to divide the same labor into several different parts or several different stages, with each person responsible for a part or completing a stage, and finally completing the entire task together. The bourgeois economist Adam Smith once studied an example of a pin manufacturing workshop in the first chapter of *The Wealth of Nations*, which already had the form of division of labor in the early capitalist period: in this workshop, one person takes the wire, one person cuts it, one person does the sharpening work, and there are others who grind the pinheads, polish the pin bodies, and some people who tidy up the unfinished parts. Finally, at the end, there is a person who specializes in inserting the pins. In this way, a pin-making job is divided into several stages or several parts to be completed separately. With more precise division of labor, each division is further divided into several small parts to be completed.

    In this case, if one person does it, on the one hand, his labor may not be proficient in all parts of the entire process, so he may not do it well, or even be unable to do it. Once there is a division of labor, productivity will be greatly improved, it can be increased many times (as in the above example of pin manufacturing, if there is no division of labor, one person can hardly make twenty pins a day, but with division of labor, one person can make 4,800 pins a day).

　　政治经济学教程绪论（９）
    王学文
    政治经济学的研究对象任务及其特点
    第一章　生产方式
    第一节　生产力
    至于资本主义社会的协力，则是以生产手段之集中于资本家，与自由雇佣劳动的存在为前提，协力的范围与规模，取决于资本家手中生产手段集中的程度与资本家购买劳动力的资本之大小，因此在资本主义生产方式下，劳动者以协力的形态所展开的生产力，马克思认为被“表现为资本的生产力，同样协力自身也表现为资本主义生产过程的一个特殊形态，而与分散独立劳动者以及小雇主的生产过程相对立。”（资本论第一卷第四篇第十一章）在新民主主义社会里，单纯的协力，在初期是建立在劳动者自己占有生产手段以自愿两利、等价交换为原则的基础上，劳动者自愿地平等地相互结合、相互扶助的集体劳动组织，它是大规模集体生产的萌芽，后期将因生产力的提高而发展为生产手段的集体所有，并在此基础上过渡到社会主义去。在社会主义社会里，则是建立在生产手段社会公有或国家所有的基础上，按照“各尽所能，各取所值”的原则，社会主义大规模集体生产的基本形态。这是单纯协力史的发展的大概情况，协力本身的发展，随着协力所引起的生产力的发展，也由单纯而进至复杂，即由单纯协力进到了复杂的协力。
    分工——复杂的协力，可大大提高生产力
    分工（有人叫做分业，或分功）是劳动组织形式的另一种，也是协力的一种，又叫做复杂的协力。因为协力是多数人结合在一起，共同负担一个工作。分工乃是把同一劳动划分为若干不同的部分，或若干不同的阶段，每个人担任一部分，或完成一个阶段，最后共同完成整个的工作。资产阶级经济学家亚当斯密曾经在诸国民之富第一章里学过一个制针工场手工业的例子，它已具有资本主义初期分工的形式：在这个工场手工业里，有一个人拿铁丝，一个人切断它，一个人作磨尖的工作，另外有磨针头的，磨光针身的，还有人整理没有做好的地方，最后终结的时候，还有一个人专门管插针，这样子，一个造针工作，是分由若干阶段，或若干部分分别来完成，在更加精密的分工下，就是每一段分工中，都还分的若干小部分来完成的。
    在这样的情况下，如果一个人来做，一方面他的劳动不一定对整个过程的各个部分都熟练，因此不一定做得好，甚至做不出来。如果一经分工之后，生产力就大大的提高，它可以提高许多倍（如上举制针之例不分工，一个人一天难以做出二十枚针，可是一经分工，一人一天可做到四八○○枚）。　　　（未完）
