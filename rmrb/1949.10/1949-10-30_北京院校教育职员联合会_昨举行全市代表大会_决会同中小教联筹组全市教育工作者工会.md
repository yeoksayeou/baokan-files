　　【Beijing News】The Beijing Higher Education Staff Union held a city-wide congress yesterday (the 29th). The meeting decided that the union would jointly initiate the organization of the Beijing Education Workers' Union with the Beijing Secondary and Primary School Staff Union and other groups.
　　More than 290 representatives from 16 units, including North China University, North China People's Revolutionary University, Peking University, Tsinghua University, Yenching University, Normal University, Beijing Management Institute of China Jiaotong University, Fu Jen Catholic University, and Peking Union Medical College, attended the meeting. Wu Yuzhang, President of North China University, Hu Xikui, Vice President of the People's Revolutionary University, Peng Zhen, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Wen Jiasi, representative of the Beijing Branch of the China Democratic League, Xue Chengye, Chairman of the Beijing Secondary and Primary School Education Union, and Li Lisan, Minister of Labor of the Central People's Government, attended the congress and delivered speeches.
　　The meeting began with a speech by President Wu Yuzhang on "The Organizational Problems of School Education Workers." Using North China University's organization of a trade union composed of all education workers, including service personnel, as an example, he called on the Beijing Higher Education Staff Union to expand unity in order to establish a trade union organization for education workers. Then, Luo Changpei, Secretary-General of the Congress, reported on the preparations of the Higher Education Staff Union, saying that the Beijing Higher Education Staff Union was formed by the merger of the Beijing Education and Research Union, the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Staff Union, and the New Democracy Cultural Construction Association. He said that at the beginning and during the preparation of the Higher Education Staff Union, everyone had already prepared ideologically to develop in the direction of organizing a "trade union."
　　In his speech, Comrade Peng Zhen pointed out that mental laborers engaged in school education work should organize a unified trade union. He said that the dispersion and even division among education workers caused by the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang in the past has now been largely eliminated. The faculty, staff, and workers of various universities, colleges, primary and secondary schools have established preliminary organizations and united. The conditions for education workers in Beijing to organize a unified trade union are fully available. This is the only way to better unite all education workers to fulfill their due responsibilities, improve themselves, unite with workers in all industries, and better realize the leading role of the working class. At that time, Xue Chengye, Chairman of the Beijing Secondary and Primary School Education Union, immediately responded to Comrade Peng Zhen's call, emphasizing that primary and secondary school education workers should unite well and organize their own trade unions to integrate mental and physical laborers and advance together.
　　Based on the reports of President Wu Yuzhang and Comrade Peng Zhen, the congress proceeded with group discussions. In the afternoon, the representatives listened to the report of Comrade Li Lisan and accepted his suggestion to organize a national education workers' union.
　　The congress finally unanimously passed the following resolutions: (1) The Higher Education Staff Union will unite with the Beijing Secondary and Primary School Education Union and invite union police officers from various schools to jointly organize the Beijing Education Workers' Union; (2) All the executive committee candidates proposed by the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Higher Education Staff Union will serve as preparatory committee members, and the Beijing Secondary and Primary School Education Union and the union police officers' associations of various schools will nominate preparatory committee members to form the "Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Education Workers' Union"; (3) North China University, Peking University, and Tsinghua University will be selected as conveners of the preparatory committee; (4) After sufficient preparation, a proposal will be made to organize a national education workers' union.

　　北京院校教育职员联合会　
    昨举行全市代表大会            
    决会同中小教联筹组全市教育工作者工会
    【北京讯】北京院校教职员联合会昨（二十九）日召开全市代表大会，会议决定由该会会同北京市中小学教职员联合会等团体共同发起组织北京市教育工作者工会。
    出席会议的有华北大学、华北人民革命大学、北京大学、清华大学、燕京大学、师范大学、中国交通大学北京管理学院、辅仁大学和协和医学院等十六个单位代表二百九十余人。华大校长吴玉章、革大副校长胡锡奎、中共北京市委会书记彭真、中国民主同盟北京市支部代表闻家驷、北京市中小学教联会主席薛成业和中央人民政府劳动部长李立三等均参加大会并先后讲话。
    会议首由吴玉章校长讲“学校教育工作者的组织问题”，他以华大已组织了由全校教育工作者包括勤务人员在内的工会为例，号召北京市的院校教职员联合会要扩大团结，以期成立教育工作者的工会的组织，继由大会秘书长罗常培报告院校教职联筹备经过称：北京市院校教职联是由北京市教研联、北京市教职员联合会筹委会和新民主主义文化建设协会三团体合并组成的，他说：在院校教职员联合会筹备的开始和过程中，大家即已在思想上准备朝着组织“工会”的方向发展。
    彭真同志的讲话中指出：从事学校教育工作的脑力劳动者，应该组织统一的工会。他说：过去在国民党的反动统治下造成了教育工作者间的分散甚至分裂现象，现在已经大部消除了。各院校和中小学教职员及工友已分别建立了初步的组织，团结起来了，我们北京市的教育工作者组织统一工会的条件已充分具备了，这样方能更好的团结全体教育工作者负起自己应负的任务，并提高自己，与各业工人团结一致，更好的实现工人阶级的领导作用。当时北京市中小学教联主席薛成业立即响应彭真同志号召，强调大中小学教育工作者应很好团结和组织自己的工会，使脑力劳动者与体力劳动者结合起来共同前进。
    根据吴玉章校长及彭真同志的报告，大会即分组进行讨论，下午代表们又听取了李立三同志的报告并接受了他所提组织全国教育工作者工会的建议。
    大会最后一致通过决议如下：（一）由院校教职员联合会联合北京市中小学教联，并邀请各校工警参加共同组织北京市教育工作者工会；（二）北京市院校教联筹委会拟定的执行委员候选人全部作为筹备委员，再由中小学教联及各校工警会推选筹备委员，组成“北京市教育工作者工会筹备委员会”，（三）推选华大、北大、清华三单位为筹委会召集人，（四）并准备经过相当筹备后提议组织全国性的教育工作者工会。
