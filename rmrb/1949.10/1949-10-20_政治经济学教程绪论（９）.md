    The Historical Development of the Division of Labor
    Of course, the division of labor (complex cooperation) did not only exist in capitalist society; it had already occurred far back in primitive communist society. Generally speaking, there was no division of labor in the early gathering period of primitive communist society, but sexual division of labor began in the later hunting period, with men undertaking men's labor and women undertaking women's labor. When animal husbandry became independent, it was divided out independently from primitive industry. Later, agriculture and handicrafts also became divided. This is from the perspective of the division of labor of large economic sectors and economic work. As society continues to progress and develop, the division of labor becomes more developed and more meticulous. For example, in agriculture, there is the division of labor for planting grain, planting vegetables, and planting fruit trees. In industry, there are earthworkers, woodworkers, miners, potters, metallurgists, and other kinds of divisions. Further division of labor, like the division of labor in needle-making handicraft workshops, becomes the internal division of labor in factories. But whether it is the division of labor in various industries or the internal division of labor in various industries, they all occur and develop with the development of productive forces. In the future, they will continue to develop with the continued development of productive forces and the specialization and professionalization of human labor technology, and the division of labor will become more and more detailed and stricter.
    The Advantages of the Division of Labor
    After the division of labor, each part of the work can become a specialty. Because of the division of labor, a person can specialize in a part of the work. Because of the specialization, it is easy to learn and easy to refine. On the one hand, it can save learning time, and on the other hand, progress can be faster. The benefits of the division of labor can save time for replacing tools and time for changing places, increasing labor time. This can also be seen from the development of agricultural labor mutual aid in the liberated areas. The internal organization of mutual aid is based on the specialization of labor technology for division of labor. For example, those who are good at plowing are responsible for plowing, those who are good at weeding are responsible for weeding, those who are good at sowing are responsible for sowing, those who are good at harvesting are responsible for harvesting, and handicrafts as agricultural side occupations are independent from agricultural mutual aid and carry out labor exchange mutual aid with agricultural labor. Those who are not good at this aspect of work but are good at other aspects of work will do other work. On the one hand, it increases labor efficiency, and on the other hand, it saves tools and labor time, making surplus labor available in agriculture, developing side occupations in handicrafts and transportation, and preparing a source of labor for industry. At the same time, as a result of the division of labor, people work in a department, which leads to the specialization of tools. A department's work requires a department's special tools to carry out, which must be both specialized and refined.
    Therefore, the result of the division of labor not only promotes the specialization of labor and the specialization of tools, but also promotes the development of productive forces. For example, using different knives suitable for various labor objects to cut grass, kill pigs, slaughter cattle, cut paper, and tailor clothes, etc., will increase labor efficiency. In factories, the division of labor plays a role in mutual supervision and promotion. You do this part, he does that part, one after another, tensely and tirelessly, from here to there, constantly working. If one part interrupts work, all these parts will be affected and stop working. Because the division of labor can improve productivity, capitalists use the division of labor to strengthen the exploitation of workers.

　　政治经济学教程绪论（９）
    王学文
  　政治经济学的研究对象任务及其特点
    第一章　生产方式
    第一节　生产力
    分工的史的发展
    当然，分工（复杂的协力）并不是到资本主义社会才有的，远在原始共产社会里早已发生了。大体说来，原始共产社会的初期采集时期是没有分工的，到以后狩猎时期始有性的分工，男子担任男子的劳动工作，女子担任女子的劳动工作。到了畜牧业独立的时期，畜牧业由原始产业中独立地分工出来了。再以后农业与手工业也分了工，这是从大的经济部门，经济工作的分工来说的。社会不断地向前进步发展，分工也就更加发达，更加细密，例如在农业中就有种粮食，种蔬菜，和种果木等等的分工。工业中也有土工，木工，矿工，陶工，冶工和其他种种的分工，更进一步的分工，就象制针手工业工场的分工一样，成为工厂内部的分工了。但是不论是各行业的分工或各业内部的分工，它们都是随着生产力的发展而发生发展的，今后还要随着生产力的继续发展，人类劳动技术的专门化与事业化而继续不断地发展，并且分工愈来愈细致，愈来愈严密。
    分工的好处
    分工之后，各部分工作就可以成为专业。因为分工的缘故，一个人可以专门做一部分的工作，因为专门的关系，就容易学习，容易精致。它一方面可以节省了学习的时间，另一方面进步也可以快了。分工的好处既可以节省替换工具的时间，又可以节省掉换地方的时间，增加劳动时间。这是从解放区农业劳动互助的发展，也可以看到的。互相组织内部根据劳动技术的专门化进行分工，例如善于犁地的担任犁的工作，善于锄苗的担任锄的工作，善于播种的担任播种的工作，善于刈割的担任刈割的工作，以及作为农业副业的手工业从农业互助中独立出来，与农业劳动进行变工互助。不善于这方面工作的，而长于其他方面工作的，就做其他工作，它一方面既增加了劳动效率，另一方面又节省了工具与劳动时间，使农业中有了剩余劳动力，发展了副业手工业及运输业，并为工业准备了劳动力的源泉。同时，由于分工的结果，人们在一部门工作，因此，又引起工具的专门化，一部门的工作就要有一部门的专门工具来进行，既要专又要精。
    故分工的结果，不但促进了劳动的专业化，促进了工具的专门化，同时，因此也促进了生产力的发展。例如用适合于各种不同的劳动对象的各种不同的刀子来切草、杀猪、宰牛、裁纸裁衣等等其劳动效率就高。在工厂中，分工更起了互相督促推动的作用，你做这部分，他做那部分，接二连三地紧张不懈的由这里传到那里，不断的工作，如果有一部分中断工作，所有这些部分都要受影响而停止工作。因为分工能提高生产力，因此资本家就利用分工来加强榨取工人。
