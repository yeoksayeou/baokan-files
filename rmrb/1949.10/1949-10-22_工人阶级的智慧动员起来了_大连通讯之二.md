　　The Wisdom of the Working Class is Mobilized
  　Dalian Dispatch II
    By Our Correspondent in Dalian, Tian Liu
    In February of this year, the workers of the Dalian Glass Factory became anxious about a major issue. According to the usage period, the factory's large melting furnace should be repaired on February 15th, but the iron bricks for repairing the furnace and the heat-resistant bricks were not fully prepared in time. Should they stop work and wait for the furnace repair materials? The factory has become a state-owned and worker-owned enterprise, who would willingly wait! With hopeful hearts, everyone asked the engineer: "Can the large furnace's lifespan be extended a bit?" The engineer shook his head worriedly: "No, if we only rely on enthusiasm and disregard technical regulations, it will cause immeasurable losses!" The workers returned to the large furnace in disappointment. The more they looked, the more worried they became. The large furnace, which was bombarded by the white-hot glass slurry twenty-four hours a day, had been corroded with a deep groove of more than 200 millimeters at the slurry's water level. The iron bricks, which were originally 300 millimeters thick, were only 20 millimeters thick at their thinnest point. If it continued to be used, the 1600-degree high-temperature glass melt would break through the iron bricks, and then everything would be unimaginable. Everyone was anxious. Liu Maoyou, a veteran worker of twenty-five years and the head of the melting department (large furnace) since liberation, was even more anxious. He knew better than anyone that the large furnace was the soul of the entire factory. If the large furnace stopped, the entire factory could not produce. He was restless and unable to eat or sleep well. He was thinking: "What should I do?" Finally, Lao Liu came up with a solution. After getting the factory director's approval, he started to implement it. First, he appropriately lowered the temperature of the glass slurry in the furnace so that it would no longer corrode the already thinly corroded furnace wall. Then, he broke the old specifications of the Japanese invaders' furnace duct installation, added more air ducts and increased the wind power, so that the corroded iron bricks would cool down rapidly, reducing the erosion of the high temperature. In this way, the large furnace was preserved. February and March passed, and the large furnace remained intact. The workers cheered and increased production. In April, when the Communist Party of Lüda was made public, the entire factory launched an "Emulate the Party" campaign. The workers wanted to complete the year's production tasks by "July 1st" as a gift to their beloved leader Chairman Mao. This task was 63 percent higher than the highest level during the Japanese occupation, and 30 percent higher than last year. Everyone was working hard. The workers arrived at their posts three minutes before their shifts began, familiarizing themselves with the work situation and machine conditions of the previous shift, so that they could immediately take over and continue production as soon as the time came. The phenomenon of unwarranted absenteeism averaged only one in a thousand in half a year. Precisely at eight o'clock on the morning of "July 1st," the annual production task was completed. The entire factory celebrated the Party's birthday in the victorious sound of production, overjoyed. More than a thousand workers signed a letter to Chairman Mao, reporting the unprecedented production miracle created by the liberated working class under the leadership of the Party since the factory was established twenty-five years ago.
    The working class of Lüda is building the people's industry in this way, with the attitude of masters of the country. Everyone is using their brains to improve production technology and eliminate unreasonable phenomena in production. They call their technical improvements or inventions "rationalization proposals" – something the workers learned from their closest friend, the Soviet Union. Soviet comrades shared one of their most successful experiences in building industry over the past thirty years – carrying out a rationalization proposal movement among all employees – to various factories in Dalian. This is the best way to run people's enterprises by relying on the working class. In Sino-Soviet joint ventures, Soviet comrades often explain a clear, but often overlooked or biased issue to our cadres and trade union workers: that is, increasing production mainly depends on improving technology, not on excessively increasing working hours and enhancing labor intensity. They also said: Production should rise in a straight line, not in waves. In this regard, we sometimes praised people who worked three days and three nights without rest for work in the past; competition in some factories reached the point of harming the body, and the result of the competition was often an increase in output and an increase in patients, followed by a relative decline in production. The working class's enthusiasm for production is extremely valuable, but it must be combined with improved production technology. The rationalization proposal movement is the best way to enlighten the broad masses of workers and use their brains to improve technology and eliminate unreasonable phenomena in production, based on the highly production enthusiasm of the awakened working class. Only production upsurge based on technological improvement is the most solid. On the production charts of the industrial exhibition, you can see that the red line representing production performance is rising step by step, and no factory has a wave-like rise or fall. This is of course due to many factors, but the rationalization proposal movement is an important one. From liberation to June of this year, there have been 1185 rationalization proposals in various factories in Lüda, which is undoubtedly a great contribution to the industrial construction of Lüda. In the construction equipment hall of the industrial exhibition, you can see a large oil painting of Lüda's special-class labor hero. He is the melting minister of the glass factory and a glorious Communist Party member. Because of his rationalization proposal, the melting furnace of the glass factory extended its lifespan by seven months, allowing the factory to complete its annual production task in half a year. Due to the implementation of Wang Zhifu's rationalization proposal, the Chuanchu Boiler Factory saved 18 tons of iron, 55 tons of coke, and 1,500 man-days in completing a boiler task.
    When the rationalization proposal movement was first launched in Lüda, there was a tendency to look down on simple improvements and stick to old ways and routines. This July, the Soviet Union awarded Akobav, a worker at the Baku Petroleum Machinery Manufacturing Plant, the "Socialist Competition Laborer Excellence Medal," which greatly inspired Lüda. Akobav suggested using the last few minutes of get off work to adjust the lathe so that the person taking over the shift could start the lathe production from the start. On the surface, what's so great about this suggestion? However, after the factory adopted this suggestion, it saved 1,800 lathe hours a month. Calculated on the basis of each lathe working 24 hours a day and an average of 25 working days per month, the Baku Petroleum Machinery Manufacturing Plant is equivalent to adding three lathes. The Dalian Glass Factory has a similar situation. Because the workers came three minutes early when taking over the shift and familiarized themselves with the work situation of the previous shift (especially the machine conditions), so that they could continue to work immediately after taking over the shift, this saved 50 labor hours a day, which is equivalent to adding more than six workers. It makes sense not to call rationalization proposals "inventions." Because "invention" sounds very famous and easily intimidates the working masses; at the same time, the scope is too narrow. The two examples mentioned above do not seem to be inventions, but they are extremely valuable rationalization proposals. The rationalization proposal movement being carried out in various factories in Lüda includes the following aspects: inventions, technical improvements, improvements in labor organization and production processes, etc. In carrying out the rationalization proposal movement, Lüda gained another important experience, that is, to criticize and punish bureaucrats who ignore or hinder rationalization proposals. In the Soviet Union, a law has been enacted that anyone who suppresses or detains rationalization proposals will be punished by law. Naturally, this does not mean that suggestions should be hastily "adopted" and "implemented" without careful study and consideration, which would produce worse results and even disrupt the production mechanism. Therefore, Lüda's third experience is to carry out the rationalization proposal movement with leadership. The factory administration should provide all conveniences and material assistance to rationalization proposers, and quickly publicize all adopted rationalization proposals and give appropriate rewards. Now, major factories in Dalian have organized rationalization proposal committees as leading institutions specifically for enlightening, leading, approving, promoting, and rewarding rationalization proposal movements. The rationalization proposal committee of the railway factory is composed of the deputy factory director, engineer, technology section chief, technician, etc., with the engineer as the director. After a worker proposes a rationalization proposal, the on-site factory director and technician will study and review it, and submit the results to the rationalization committee, and implement it immediately when it is considered suitable. The "technical bounty" of the China Chang Railway and the "recruiting meritorious service" of some factories are very worthy of attention. This is the most important measure to carry out the rationalization proposal movement with leadership. According to the needs of each site, propose several of the most urgent problems that should be improved, mobilize workers to think of ways to improve and create, and predetermine the amount of bonuses, so that the wisdom of all workers can be mobilized and concentrated on the problems that need to be solved. Not long ago, the locomotive section proposed to the car factory "a reward of 5,000 yuan (Kwantung currency, the same below. The current price is about 12,000 yuan RMB) for those who can test the injector on the ground," because in the past, the test was carried out on the locomotive, which was very slow and laborious. The workers were all thinking about how to do this. As a result, Director Qu Zuofa studied and used the water pressure of the "safety valve" and successfully tested it on the ground and won the prize.

　　工人阶级的智慧动员起来了
  　大连通讯之二
    本报驻大连记者 田流
    今年二月间，大连玻璃工厂的职工们为一件重大的事情焦急起来了。厂里的溶化大窑按照使用的期限，应于二月十五日修理，但没有修窑的铁砖，耐热砖也一时准备不齐。停工等待修窑器材么？工厂已成为国家和工人自己的企业，谁能甘心等待呢！大家怀着一颗希望的心，去请问工程师：“大窑还能延长一点寿命么？”工程师忧愁的摇摇头：“不能，如果只凭热情，不顾技术的规定，要造成不可计量的损失！”工人们失望的回到大窑旁。越看越让人担心。一天二十四小时被发着白光的玻璃浆液激荡着的大窑，在浆液水平线处，已经腐蚀了一道二百多毫米的深沟，总共三百毫米厚的铁砖，最薄处只剩二十毫米厚了。再使用下去，一千六百度高热的玻璃溶浆，势将突破铁砖，那时一切都不堪设想了。每一个人都在着急。二十五年的老工友、解放后升任溶化部（大窑）长的刘茂有更着急，他比谁都清楚，大窑是整个工厂的灵魂，大窑停工，全厂就不能生产。他坐卧不宁，寝食不安。他在想：“到底怎么办呢？”老刘最后想出了办法，得到厂长的赞助后，他便动手实行起来了。他先把窑内的玻璃浆液适当的降低温度，使它不再侵蚀那已被侵蚀得很薄的窑壁，再把日寇装置火炉风管的老规格打破，增添风管并加大风力，使被侵蚀着的铁砖急速冷却，减轻高热的侵蚀。就是这样，大窑被保存下来了。二月、三月过去了，大窑依然无恙，工友们欢呼着增加生产。四月，中共旅大党公开时，全厂掀起“拥党竞赛”，职工们要在“七一”完成全年生产任务，作为对亲爱领袖毛主席的献礼。这个任务比日寇时代的最高水平高出百分之六十三，比去年也高了百分之三十。每一个人都在努力，工人们在接班前三分钟就到了自己的岗位旁边。熟习上一班的工作情形和机器状况，以便时间一到，马上接班继续生产。无故欠勤的现象在半年中只平均千分之一。恰恰在“七一”早晨八点钟，完成了全年的生产任务。全厂工人在生产胜利声中庆祝党的生日，欢欣若狂。千余名工友签名上书毛主席、报告获得了解放的工人阶级在党领导下创造的自从该厂建立二十五年以来所未有的生产奇迹。
    旅大的工人阶级，就是这样以国家主人翁的姿态，建造着人民的工业。每一个人都在为改进生产技术，消除生产中不合理的现象而开动着自己的脑筋。他们将自己这种技术改进或发明创造，叫作合理化建议——这是工人们向自己最亲挚的朋友苏联学来的。苏联同志把他们建国三十年以来，建设工业最成功的经验之一——在全体职工间开展合理化建议运动，传播给大连各个工厂。这是依靠工人阶级办好人民企业的最好方法。在中苏合营的企业里，苏联同志常常向我们的干部和工会工作者、说明一个明显的，但是常常被忽略或产生偏向的问题：即提高生产主要靠改进技术，不是超限度的增加劳动时间和增强劳动强度。又说：生产应斜线上升，不应波浪式的起落。在这方面，我们过去有时歌颂为工作而三天三夜不休息的人；有些工厂里的竞赛达到了损害身体的程度，常常竞赛的结果是产量提高，病员增多，接着而来的是生产相对的下降。工人阶级的生产热情，是极可宝贵的，但一定要使它和改进生产技术相结合。合理化建议运动，正是在觉悟了的工人阶级高度生产热情基础上，启发广大工人，开动脑筋改进技术，消灭生产中不合理现象的最好方法。只有建立在技术改进基础上的生产高涨才是最巩固的。在工业展览会的生产图表上，可以看到表示生产成绩的红线在步步升高，没有一个厂有着波浪式的起伏或下降，这固然有着多方面的因素，但合理化建议运动却是其中重要的一个。从解放以后到今年六月，旅大各工厂中的合理化建议已达一一八五件，对旅大的工业建设，无疑是贡献极大的。在工业展览会建设器材馆内，可以看到旅大工业特等劳动英雄的大幅油画，他是玻璃工厂熔化部长，光荣的共产党员，因为他的合理化建议，玻璃工厂的熔化大窑延长了七个月的寿命，使该厂半年完成了全年生产任务。船渠锅炉工厂由于实行了王智富的合理化建议。在一项作锅炉任务完成时，节省了十八吨铁，五十五吨焦炭和一千五百个人工。
    旅大初行合理化建议运动时，曾发生过看不起简单改进和固步自封墨守成规的偏向，今年七月，苏联赠给巴库石油机器制造厂工人阿柯巴夫以“社会主义竞赛劳动者优胜奖章”的事情，对旅大启示很大。阿柯巴夫建议利用下班的最后几分钟把车床调整一下，以便接班的人一开始就能开动车床生产。表面上看起来，这个建议有什么了不起呢？然而该厂采用了这个建议，一个月就节省了一八○○个车床小时。以每台车床一天工作二十四小时，每月平均二十五天劳动日计，巴库石油机器制造厂等于增加了三台车床。大连玻璃工厂也有同样的情形。因为工友们接班时早来三分钟，熟习上一班工作的情形（特别是机器状况），以便接班后马上继续工作，这就使得每天节省了五○个劳动小时，等于增加了六个以上的工人。合理化建议不叫“创造发明”，十分有道理。因为“创造发明”听起来名声很大，容易吓住工人群众；同时范围也太狭小，象上面举的两个例子，似乎不算什么创造发明，然而却是价值极大的合理化建议。旅大各工厂中开展着的合理化建议运动，包括下述几个方面，即创造发明，技术改进，劳动组织生产过程等的改善……。在开展合理化建议运动中、旅大得到了另一个重要经验，即给予忽视或阻碍合理化建议的官僚主义者以批评和处分。在苏联，已经订有一条法律，凡压抑或扣留合理化建议者，要受到法律的制裁。自然，这不是说不经过慎重研究和考虑，就轻率的“采纳”和“实行”建议，那会产生更坏的结果，甚至打乱了生产机构。因此，旅大的第三个经验是要有领导的开展合理化建议运动。工厂行政上要给合理化建议者一切便利条件和物质帮助，并迅速的进广已采用的一切合理化建议，给予恰当的奖励。现在大连各大工厂都组织起了合理化建议委员会，作为专门启发、领导、批准、推广、奖励合理化建议运动的领导机构。铁路工厂的合理化建议委员会，由副厂长、工程师、技术科长、技师等参加，以工程师为主任。工人提出合理化建议后，即由现场场长、技师研究审查，将结果送交合理化委员会，认为合用时马上实行。中长铁路的“技术悬赏”和有些厂的“招立功”是个非常值得重视的方法，这是有领导的开展合理化建议运动最重要的措置。根据各个现场的需要，提出几个最迫切应该改进的问题，发动工友们想办法改进和创造，并预定出奖金数目，这样便可以把全体工友的智慧动员起来，集中到需要解决的问题上去，在不久以前，机务段对车厂提出“能在平地试验注水器者奖五千元”（关东币、下同。现价约合人民币一万二千元），因为过去都是在机车上试验，很慢很费工。工友们都为这事动脑筋想办法，结果曲作发厂长研究用“安全弁”的水压，在平地试验成功，得了奖。
