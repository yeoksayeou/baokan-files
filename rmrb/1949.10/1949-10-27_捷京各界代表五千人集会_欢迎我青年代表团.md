Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 26th — On the evening of the 24th, 5,000 representatives of youth, soldiers, workers, and civil servants from all circles in Prague gathered at the Lucerna Hall in the center of Prague to welcome the Chinese Democratic Youth Delegation led by Xiao Hua to Czechoslovakia. This was another enthusiastic demonstration of the brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Czech people, following the rally held on the 12th of this month by all circles in Prague to celebrate the founding of the People's Republic of China. After arriving in Czechoslovakia, Xiao Hua and his delegation were received by the Central Committee of the Czech Youth League, and visited factories, youth railway construction teams, and hydropower station construction teams in Brno, Gottwaldov, and Bratislava. They returned to Prague on the morning of the 24th. At the welcoming meeting, Herzler, Chairman of the Czech Youth League, pointed out in his speech the great significance of the founding of the People's Republic of China for consolidating world peace, and the close relationship between the Czech youth and people and the Chinese youth and people who, after a long and arduous struggle, defeated American imperialism and its running dog, the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek. In his reply, Xiao Hua recounted the glorious achievements he had personally witnessed of the Czech youth and people building socialism under the leadership of President Gottwald, and stated: The youth of China and Czechoslovakia, and the youth of the whole world, uniting under the leadership of the human beacon, the Soviet Union, and the great Stalin, to strive for lasting world peace, people's democracy, and a bright future for mankind, victory will surely be ours! At the end of his speech, the audience was filled with shouts of "Long live Stalin, Mao Zedong, and Gottwald".

The welcoming program included a large chorus and folk dance program organized by the Prague District Youth League. A group of forty or so Czech young men and women sang "The People's Liberation Army's Great Counter-Offensive" in Chinese phonetic transcription. The entire audience stood up and enthusiastically shouted "Mao Zedong! Mao Zedong!" for several minutes. Czech young men and women, holding flowers, swarmed around the Chinese Youth Delegation, shaking hands and kissing. They were so enthusiastic that after the meeting ended, a group of young people crowded at the entrance of the venue, shouting "People's China! People's China!" while lifting the car carrying some of the Chinese representatives high in the air.
