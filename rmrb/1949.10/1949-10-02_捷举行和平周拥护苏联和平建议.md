At rallies of manufacturing plant and factory workers in many towns, workers denounced the instigators of new wars and condemned them for betraying the Czechoslovak people in Munich eleven years ago, facilitating Hitler and Mussolini in launching imperialist wars. The working people expressed their wholehearted support for the Soviet Union's peace policy and endorsed the new peace proposals put forward by the Soviet Union at the Fourth Session of the United Nations General Assembly. Resolutions from various places have been sent to the Peace Committee, expressing the working people's willingness to do everything possible to fight for peace and friendship between nations.
