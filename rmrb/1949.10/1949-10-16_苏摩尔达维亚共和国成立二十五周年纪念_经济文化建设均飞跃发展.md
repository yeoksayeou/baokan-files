Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 15th - TASS reports: October 12th marked the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic. The people of Moldavia are celebrating their holiday with brilliant achievements in the restoration and construction of the economy and culture.

The predecessor of the Moldavian Republic was the Moldavian Autonomous Republic within the Ukrainian Republic, which had been established for twenty-five years. In 1940, the Soviet Union recovered Bessarabia from fascist Romania, which it had been invaded and occupied in 1918, and incorporated it into the Moldavian Autonomous Republic, establishing the Moldavian Republic, which joined the Soviet Union. However, from the summer of 1941, the entire republic was occupied by the German and Romanian fascist troops for three years. Under the dark rule of the Romanian landlords and bourgeoisie for twenty-two years, Bessarabia's economy and culture were extremely backward, and the destruction was even more severe during the three-year occupation by the German and Romanian fascist gangs. The brilliant achievements made by the working people of the republic in the restoration and construction in the short years after the war once again vividly demonstrated the superiority of the socialist system.

Now, hundreds of industrial enterprises in the republic are producing various products. The capital of the republic, Chisinau, was 80 percent destroyed by the Hitler bandits. Now, the industrial output of Chisinau alone is more than the total industrial output of the entire Bessarabia before the establishment of Soviet power.

Moldavia's agriculture is also rapidly transforming. The working farmers of Bessarabia are rapidly advancing on the road to collectivization. Eighty percent of peasant households have formed collective farms. For centuries, they had been farming with hoes, but now they have eighty-four machine and tractor stations, using a large number of tractors and agricultural machines to farm the land. The total cultivated area of the republic has exceeded that before the war. These young collective farms have established more than two thousand livestock farms this year alone.

The Moldavian people have also achieved great success in cultural development. The republic has a population of more than three million, but it has opened 1,400 schools, as well as nine higher education institutions and thirty-eight secondary specialized schools, as well as a national university and fourteen research institutes. Literature and art are also developing victoriously. The works of Lenin, Stalin, Pushkin, Lermontov, Chekhov, and Tolstoy have been published in Moldavian. In recent years, more than 1,000 kinds of books have been published, with a total circulation of 11 million copies.

　　苏摩尔达维亚共和国成立二十五周年纪念
  　经济文化建设均飞跃发展
    【新华社北京十五日电】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：十月十二日是苏联摩尔达维亚共和国成立二十五周年纪念日。摩尔达维亚人民以经济文化之恢复与建设的光辉成绩，庆祝他们的节日。
    摩尔达维亚共和国的前身，是乌克兰共和国境内的摩尔达维亚自治共和国，成立已有二十五年。一九四○年，苏联从法西斯罗马尼亚收回它一九一八年被侵占去的比萨拉比亚，归入摩尔达维亚自治共和国而成立摩尔达维亚共和国，加入苏联。但从一九四一年夏起，全共和国又被德国和罗马尼亚的法西斯军队侵占了三年之久。比萨拉比亚在罗马尼亚地主资产阶级二十二年的黑暗统治下，经济文化异常落后，在德、罗法西斯匪帮三年占领期间，破坏更加惨重。战后短短的几年中，共和国劳动人民进行恢复建设所获得的光辉成就，又一次生动地说明了社会主义制度是多么优越。
    现在，共和国已有数以百计的工业企业生产着各种产品。共和国的首都基希尼夫曾被希特勒匪徒破坏了百分之八十，现在而基希尼夫一地的工业产量，比全比萨拉比亚在建立苏维埃政权之前的全部工业总产量还要多。
    摩尔达维亚的农业也在迅速转化中。比萨拉比亚的劳动农民正在集体化的道路上迅速前进。已有百分之八十的农户组成了集体农场。若干世纪以来，他们一直用锄种地，现在却已拥有了八十四个机器与拖拉机站，使用大批拖拉机和农业机器来种地。全共和国耕地面积已超过了战前。这些年青的集体农场，光是今年就建立了两千多个牲口饲养场。
    摩尔达维亚人民在文化发展上也获得了很大的成功，共和国共有三百多万人口，却已开办了一千四百所学校，此外尚有九个高等教育机关和三十八个中等专门学校以及国立大学和十四个研究所。文学与艺术也正在胜利地发展着。列宁、斯大林、普希金、莱蒙托夫、契科夫和托尔斯泰的作品，都已用摩尔达维亚文出版。最近几年中，已出版了一千多种书，共发行了一千一百万册。
