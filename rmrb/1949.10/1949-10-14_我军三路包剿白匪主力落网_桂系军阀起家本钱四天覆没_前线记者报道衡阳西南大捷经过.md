Xinhua News Agency, Central China Front, 13th: A frontline reporter reported on the annihilation of the four divisions belonging to the Seventh and Forty-eighth Armies of Bai Chongxi's bandit troops, saying: After the launch of the full-scale offensive in Central China, the Western Route Army of the People's Liberation Army advanced rapidly along the south bank of the Yuan River in several routes. With the force of a torrential storm, it successively seized the cities of Luxi, Chenxi, Yuanling, and Huaihua on both banks of the Yuan River. In three days, it captured Zhijiang, completely cutting off the Xiangqian Highway. Under this situation, Bai Chongxi hastily transferred the 46th Army stationed in Lechang, northern Guangdong, the 97th Army in Chenxian, southern Hunan, and the 48th Army in Leiyang to the area between Hengyang and Shaoyang. Together with the Bai bandit 7th Army and a division of the 126th Army and a part of the 58th Army in that area, they attempted to contain the advance of the People's Liberation Army. At this time, the Central Route Army of the People's Liberation Army suddenly crossed the Yuehan Railway westward across the Xiang River, forming a pincer attack on the Bai bandits with the Western Route Army of the People's Liberation Army in Zhijiang. Bai Chongxi immediately felt the seriousness of the situation and hastily retreated across the board on the morning of the 7th. At that time, the Western Route Army of the People's Liberation Army immediately turned east after the Zhijiang Campaign, and the Central Route Army broke through the Heng (Yang) Shao (Yang) line and inserted itself into the enemy's formation. At the same time, the Eastern Route Army of the People's Liberation Army also crossed the Yuehan Railway and advanced westward. At this point, the four main divisions of the Bai bandits in the triangular area between Hengyang, Shaoyang, and Qiyang were trapped in the encirclement of our army. The surrounded bandits were the 171st Division and 172nd Division of the Gui Clique's 7th Army, and the 176th Division and 138th Division of the 48th Army. These four divisions were the founding capital of the Gui Clique warlords, painstakingly managed for more than 20 years, and were known as "elite." The Bai bandits were cunning by nature and had always retreated with their main forces in previous battles, thus escaping annihilation. This time, they were finally surrounded by the People's Liberation Army in the overlapping mountainous areas of Huangtupu, Baidishi, Yanjadian and other places, with no way to escape, and were as frightened as homeless dogs. On the 8th and 9th, there was incessant rain on the front lines, and the People's Liberation Army braved the rain to carry out encirclement and annihilation, with fierce fighting all day long. The enemy ran around like headless chickens within the encirclement and attempted to break through many times, but all failed. By the 10th, the bandits had run out of food and ammunition and were in disarray. The People's Liberation Army then launched a prisoner-capture race. The battle ended on the 11th, and the headquarters of the bandit 7th Army and all four divisions were wiped out. Currently, our army is searching the mountains and forests to capture scattered remnants. At night, tens of thousands of torches illuminate the entire Wufeng Mountain area, forming an extremely spectacular picture of capturing prisoners.

　　我军三路包剿白匪主力落网
    桂系军阀起家本钱四天覆没
    前线记者报道衡阳西南大捷经过
    【新华社华中前线十三日电】前线记者报道白崇禧匪军主力第七军第四十八军所属四个师覆灭的经过称：华中全线攻势发动后，解放军西路大军沿沅江南岸分路向芷江疾进，以骤风急雨之势，连续抢占沅江两岸的泸溪、辰溪、沅陵、怀化诸城，三日并一举夺取芷江，完全斩断湘黔公路。白匪崇禧处此情势下，遂于五日仓皇将其驻粤北乐昌之四十六军，湘南郴县之九十七军及耒阳之四十八军等部调集衡阳、邵阳之间，协同该地白匪第七军及一二六军一个师与五十八军一部企图牵制解放军大军前进。此时，解放军中路大军突然越过粤汉路西渡湘江，与芷江解放军西路大军对白匪形成东西钳击之势。白匪崇禧顿感形势严重，乃于七日晨起仓皇全线撤退。其时，解放军西路大军于芷江战役结束后，立即挥戈东进，中路大军则兼程突破衡（阳）邵（阳）线插入敌阵，同时解放军东路大军亦横越粤汉路向西猛进。至此，处于衡阳、邵阳、祁阳间三角地带的白匪主力四个师，乃陷于我大军包围之中。被包围之匪系桂系第七军之一七一师、一七二师及四十八军之一七六师、一三八师，这四个师是桂系军阀的起家本钱，惨淡经营二十余年，号称“精锐”。白匪贼性狡猾，历次战斗中均将该主力部队尽先撤逃，因此得以幸免被歼。此次终被解放军各路大军错杂围困于黄土铺、白地市、严家殿等地岗峦重叠山区，走头无路，惶惶有如丧家之犬。八、九两日，前线霪雨霏霏，解放军冒雨进行围歼，终日激战。敌于包围圈内狼奔豕突，多次企图突围，均不得逞。激战至十日，匪已粮尽弹绝，溃不成军，解放军遂展开捉俘虏竞赛，至十一日战斗即告结束，匪第七军军部及四个师悉数就歼。现我军正搜山探林，捕捉零星溃散的残匪。入夜千万个火把，照亮了整个五峰山区，形成一幅极其壮观的捉俘虏的图景。
