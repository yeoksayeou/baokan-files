Xinhua News Agency, Central China Front, 15th: The People's Liberation Army's various forces, which annihilated the main force of the White bandits' four divisions in the Huangshapu area southwest of Hengyang, are disregarding all fatigue and difficulties, penetrating deep into the dense mountains and forests, clearing out the scattered bandit troops by region, and launching a competition to capture prisoners. After the main force of the White bandits fell into the dense encirclement of the People's Liberation Army's various forces, they fled in all directions and struggled desperately, but were unable to escape the net. By the afternoon of the 10th, they had collapsed and fled in disorder all over the mountains and plains, vainly attempting to escape by dispersing. The various units of the People's Liberation Army immediately launched a large-scale round-up to block, encircle, and search for scattered bandits. Personnel from directly subordinate units and logistics departments also actively participated in this work. A certain unit's leader proposed to the entire army: "Capture one more fleeing enemy, and we will reduce the enemy's strength by one more." A certain unit proposed to its subordinate units to conduct continuous and repeated searches for three days and three nights. Thus, the entire army, from top to bottom, responded enthusiastically to the call of the higher authorities, launching a search and capture campaign to thoroughly and completely eliminate the scattered bandits and consolidate local security, working tirelessly day and night, regardless of hunger and rain. In order to ensure the rapid annihilation of the remaining bandits and prevent any from escaping, the various units specifically divided areas, unified time, coordinated actions, and carried out organized and planned large-scale netting or regional netting operations. During the day, the PLA clearing troops went deep into the mountains and forests, setting up checkpoints at all important road intersections, strictly sealing them off, encircling first and then suppressing, and organizing local people and prisoners to shout to try to persuade the remaining bandits who had fled into the mountains to surrender. At night, thousands of torches were lit in the mountains and fields, illuminating the mountains as bright as day, leaving the scattered bandits nowhere to hide. When searching for scattered bandits, a certain unit's leader specifically requested the troops to strictly prevent accidental injury to the people in the mountains, or to violate mass discipline under the pretext of searching. The scattered bandits, now as panic-stricken as stray dogs, are being captured in large numbers by our forces, and bandit leaders are falling into our hands one after another. In one day alone, the 11th, a certain unit captured more than a thousand bandits. The remaining bandits in the mountainous areas are nearing complete elimination.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China Front, 15th: Following the capture of White bandit Seventh Army Deputy Commander Ling Yunshang and others, the People's Liberation Army search troops captured bandit Seventh Army 171st Division Commander Zhang Ruisheng, 172nd Division Commander Liu Yuejian, and 48th Army 176th Division Commander Li Zulin in the Wufeng Mountain area. These bandits were all trusted henchmen of the White bandit Chong Xi. Zhang Ruisheng was captured on the 12th; Liu Yuejian and Li Zulin were captured one after another on the 13th, after they were driven out of caves in a sorry state due to the autumn rain and the difficulty of hiding in the deep mountains.

　　衡阳西南我军捕捉俘虏
  　白匪三个师长先后就擒
    【新华社华中前线十五日电】在衡阳西南黄山铺一带聚歼白匪主力四个师的解放军各路大军，正不顾一切疲劳和困难，深入丛山密林，分区清剿溃散匪军，展开捕捉俘虏的竞赛。此次白匪主力陷入解放军各路大军密密层层的大包围后，狼奔豕突，进行绝命的挣扎，均不能逃出网罗，至十日下午，即溃不成军，漫山遍野落荒而逃，妄想分散脱逃。解放军各部乃立即展开堵截、围剿、搜索散匪的大围捕。各部直属队、后勤部门等机关单位人员，也积极参加此项工作。某部首长向全军提出：“多捉一个逃敌，就多减少敌人一个力量”。某部则向所属部队提出进行三天三夜的连续反复搜剿。于是全军上下，澈夜不眠，不顾饥饿风雨，热烈地响应上级号召，展开搜捕运动，以彻底、干净肃清散匪，巩固地方治安。各部为保证迅速歼灭残匪，使其无一漏网，更具体划分地区，统一时间，协同动作，进行有组织、有计划的大拉网或分区拉网的清剿。白天，解放军各清剿部队深入山林，在各要道路口遍设卡哨，严密封锁，先围后剿，并组织当地民众和俘虏进行喊话，争取窜入山林的残匪来归。入夜，山野中点起了千万个火把，照耀得遍山明若白昼，使散匪无处藏身。某部首长在搜捕散匪时，特别要求部队严防误伤山地的民众，或借口搜查而违犯群众纪律。现惶惶如丧家之犬的散匪，正陆续为我大批捕捉，匪首相继落网，仅某部在十一日的一天中，俘匪即达千余。山区残匪已近彻底肃清。
    【新华社华中前线十五日电】继白匪第七军副军长凌云上等落网后，解放军搜山部队又于五峰山区捕获匪第七军一七一师师长张瑞生、一七二师师长刘月鉴、四十八军一七六师师长李祖霖。该匪等均系白匪崇禧的亲信爪牙。张瑞生系于十二日捕获；刘月鉴及李祖霖则因秋雨淋漓，深山难于藏身，狼狈窜出岩穴时于十三日先后被擒。
