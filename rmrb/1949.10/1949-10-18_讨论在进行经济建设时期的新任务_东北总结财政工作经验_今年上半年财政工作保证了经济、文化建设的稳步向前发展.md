Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 17th: Shenyang News: The Finance Department of the Northeast People's Government convened a joint conference of the heads of the finance departments of the Northeast provinces and the directors of the municipal finance bureaus last month. The conference focused on discussing the new tasks of financial work in the Northeast during the period of full-scale economic construction, summarizing the experience of financial work over the past three years, and reviewing the financial revenue and expenditure situation in the first half of the year.

The conference summary pointed out that the financial work in the Northeast over the past three years has had three basic experiences: (1) Financial work should have a clear purpose. The main task of financial work in the past was to support the revolutionary war. In the future, in addition to continuing to support the national revolutionary war, financial work should also vigorously serve economic construction. (2) The financial foundation should be based on the development of production. Only by doing a good job in production can social wealth be increased, and the financial situation can be improved. (3) Financial work is a powerful weapon for promoting economic construction.

The national financial budget is a concentrated expression of national economic development, and financial work is a lever that plays a regulatory role in the distribution and redistribution of the entire national economy. Therefore, all policies, regulations, and decrees related to finance have both encouraging and restrictive aspects. The view that financial work only plays a purely negative restrictive role is incorrect.

After reviewing the financial revenue and expenditure situation in the first half of 1949, the conference pointed out that the financial work in the past six months has basically guaranteed the implementation of the original financial plan, increased investment in industrial, mining, and railway construction, and guaranteed the expenses of agriculture, forestry, transportation, and social and cultural undertakings, enabling the economic and cultural construction of the Northeast to develop steadily. However, due to insufficient experience in urban financial work, although there have been improvements in tax collection and other work, they are still far from sufficient; the profit income of public enterprises, especially light industry, has not reached the level it should have. Therefore, in the future, it is necessary to correctly implement the tax policy for industry and commerce in order to increase national income, stabilize financial prices, and promote the development of legitimate industry and commerce. For state-owned and public-owned enterprises, it is necessary to promote the establishment and improvement of economic accounting systems and strengthen financial supervision and management of enterprises.

The conference also discussed in detail the construction of urban finance, believing that the urban financial policy must be suitable for the two characteristics of the city being complex and centralized, and should have precise plans and sound and reasonable systems. At present, the urban economy is still in recovery, and the urban consumption population is still large. Therefore, the task of urban financial work is first to correctly study the income and tax-paying ability of urban people; second, to strengthen the supervision and management of economic accounting of municipal production enterprises and public utilities; other aspects, such as the consolidation of real estate rent tax, deed tax, and slaughter tax, are also very important.

In addition, the conference also drafted the "Provisional Regulations on the Collection of Public Grain in the Northeast Region" and formulated the "Regulations on Village Financial Management in the Northeast Region." The former was drafted based on the principle of cultivating people's strength and gradually improving farmers' lives, and made detailed provisions on burden policies, disaster area reduction and exemption methods, etc.; the latter specifically stipulated the standards for village administrative expenses and education expenses, as well as the management methods for public land and public property, in order to reduce the burden on farmers, save financial and material resources, cultivate people's strength, and develop production.

　　讨论在进行经济建设时期的新任务
  　东北总结财政工作经验
    今年上半年财政工作保证了经济、文化建设的稳步向前发展
    【新华社北京十七日电】沈阳讯：东北人民政府财政部曾于上月召开东北各省财政厅长、市财政局长联席会议。此次会议着重讨论了东北财政工作在全力进行经济建设时期的新任务，总结了三年来财政工作的经验，并检查了上半年度的财政收支状况。
    会议的总结指出：三年来东北的财政工作有三个基本经验：（一）财政工作应有明确的目的性。过去财政工作的主要任务是支援革命战争，今后的财政工作除了继续支援全国的革命战争外，还要大力服务于经济建设。（二）财政基础应建立在发展生产上。只有把生产搞好，社会财富才能增加，财政也才有出路。（三）财政工作是推动经济建设的有力武器。
    国家财政预算是国民经济发展的集中表现，财政工作是在整个国民经济的分配与再分配中起调节作用的杠杆。因此，一切有关财政的政策、条例、法令等都带有鼓励与限制的两个方面。那种认为财政工作只是单纯起消极的限制作用的看法是错误的。
    会议在检查了一九四九年上半年财政收支状况之后指出：半年来的财政工作，基本上保证了原定的财政计划的实施，增加了工矿、铁路建设的投资，保证了农林、交通及社会文化事业的费用，使东北的经济建设及文化建设得以稳步向前发展。但由于城市财政工作的经验不足，以致税收工作等虽有改进，但仍很不够；公营企业特别是轻工业的利润收入，也未达到应有的程度。因此，今后就要正确地执行工商业税收政策，以便增加国家收入，稳定金融物价，并促进正当的工商业之发展。对于国营、公营企业，则要促使其建立与健全经济核算制度，加强对企业财政之监督与管理。
    会议还详细讨论了城市财政的建设问题，认为城市财政方针必须适合城市的复杂和集中这样两个特点，应有精密的计划和健全合理的制度。目前城市经济尚在恢复中，城市的消费人口尚多，因而城市财政工作的任务，首先就是正确地研究城市人民收入及其纳税能力；其次是加强对市营生产企业及公用事业经济核算的监督和管理；其他如房地产的租税、契税、屠宰税等的整理也很重要。
    此外，会议并草拟了“东北区公粮征收暂行条例”和制定了“东北区村财政管理条例”。前者是依据培养民力，逐步提高农民生活的原则而草拟的，对负担政策、灾区减免办法等都做了详细的规定；后者具体规定了村行政费教育费的标准及公田、公产的管理办法，以减轻农民负担，节约财力物力，培养民力，发展生产。
