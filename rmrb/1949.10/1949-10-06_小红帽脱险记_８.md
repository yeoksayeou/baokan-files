　　Little Red Riding Hood Escapes Danger 8
    Mei Zhi
    The old mountain demon,
    Holding a whip in one hand,
    And green grass in the other,
    Hunching his chest,
    Bending his waist,
    Limping and carefully heading up the mountain,
    Shouting loudly:
　
    "Little Red Riding Hood,
    This time you can't escape,
    Quickly and obediently crawl into my stomach,
    So I can go back and sleep soundly."
　
    His voice was so arrogant,
    So confident,
    But also so uneasy,
    Taking a step, looking around,
    Taking a step, then pausing.
    In the distance, he threw the green grass onto the hillside,
    The old white horse jumped up and grabbed it,
    Walked to the side,
    Chewing carefully,
    Lowering its neck,
    Squinting its eyes,
    As if chewing something fragrant and sweet,
    Having a Little Red Riding Hood scared to death,
    He didn't even look at her,
    Didn't even care!
　
    Oh no,
    He's already here!
    Oh no,
    His black demonic hand,
    Is pushing open the wooden gate!
    Oh no,
    …………!
　
    At this moment,
    The old bee,
    Flew down from the tree branch,
    Aimed at the old mountain demon's old eyes,
    Extended a long stinger,
    And stung him hard again and again.
　
    The old mountain demon,
    Stung so badly,
    Covered his eyes with both hands,
    Shouting and screaming strangely:
　
    "I've been hit by an atomic bomb,
    Oh no,
    I must have been hit by an atomic bomb!
    How in a moment,
    I can't see anything?
    Hehehe,
    I'm in so much pain,
    My life is over.
    What a pity for my good appetite,
    What a pity for my good kingdom!"
    The old mountain demon,
    Cried out in a strange voice.
　
    The old bee,
    Happy with his victory,
    Really couldn't help but,
    Flap his wings and twist his waist,
    Singing and dancing:
    Buzz, buzz, buzz,
    I'm sending this big bastard off to his end.
　
    Hey!
    So it's you, little bee,
    Making me think I was hit by an atomic bomb.
　
    "It's you,
    That's really wrong!
    I've always treated you well,
    You can pick any flowers in the garden,
    You can build your hive wherever you want,
    How can you be so ungrateful and turn against me,
    And come and sting me instead?
    And come and sting me instead?"
　
    "You say you've treated me well,
    But you eat too much of the honey I've worked so hard to make,
    You eat too much!
    You drive away my children,
    You overturn my nest,
    I really can't take it anymore,
    I dare not accept your kindness anymore,
    I want to take revenge on you!
    I want to take revenge on you!"
　
    Joke, joke,
    This is really a big joke!
    A bee wants to take revenge on me,
    How can such a thing exist?
    It's you,
    I'm not afraid.
    I'll come again tomorrow,
    I'll bring a bundle of incense,
    And a bouquet of fresh flowers,
    See which one you like, let you choose!"
　
    "Okay,
    Little Red Riding Hood,
    Old man's eyes hurt tonight,
    I'll spare you to live another night for now,
    Tomorrow night I'll definitely come to eat your flesh and drink your blood."
　
    The old mountain demon,
    Covering his eyes with both hands,
    Lowering his head,
    Frowning,
    Groping and feeling his way down the mountain.

　　小红帽脱险记  ８
    梅志
    老山妖，
    一手拿着鞭子，
    一手拿着青草，
    勾着胸，
    弯着腰，
    一步一拐的留心着走上山了，
    口里还大声的喊：
　
    “小红帽，
    这下你可再也逃不了，
    快乖乖的钻进我的肚子里，
    我好回去安安稳稳的睡大觉。”
　
    他的声音那么高傲，
    那么有自信，
    但又那么不放心，
    走一步，张望一下，
    走一步，又停一停。
    远远的，他把青草抛到了山坡上，
    老白马就跳上去衔了起来，
    走到一旁边，
    细细的嚼，
    低着颈子
    眯着眼，
    好象嚼得又香又甜，
    有一个吓得要死要活的小红帽，
    他是看也不看，
    管也不管！
　
    不得了，
    他已经到了！
    不得了，
    他那黑色的魔手，
    正在推开柴门了！
    不得了，
    …………！
　
    这时候，
    老蜜蜂，
    从树枝上飞下来，
    对准老山妖的老眼睛，
    伸出一根长长的刺，
    狠命的叮了又叮。
　
    老山妖，
    被叮得
    双手按着眼，
    怪声的大叫大喊：
　
    “我中了原子弹，
    不得了，
    我一定中了原子弹！
    怎么一下儿功夫，
    我什么也看不见？
    嗬嗬嗬，
    我痛得不得了，
    我的性命完了。
    可惜我的好胃口，
    可惜我的好江山！”
    老山妖，
    怪声怪气的哭起来了。
　
    老蜜蜂，
    高兴着他的胜利，
    实在忍也忍不住，
    就鼓着翅膀扭着腰，
    又唱歌儿又跳舞：
    嗡嗡嗡，嗡嗡嗡，
    我给你这个大混蛋送送终。
　
    呔！
    原来是你这个小蜂子，
    害得我以为中了原子弹。
　
    “是你，
    那太不该！
    我一向待你并不薄，
    园子里的花任你采，
    蜂房做好任你住，
    你怎么忘恩负义倒了戈，
    反而来叮我？
    反而来叮我？”
　
    “你说对我并不薄，
    但是我辛辛苦苦酿的蜜，
    你实在吃得太多多，
    吃得太多多！
    你赶我的小孩，
    你翻我的窠，
    我实在再也忍不住，
    你这种好意我再也不敢受，
    我要向你报仇！
    我要向你报仇！”
　
    笑话，笑话，
    这真是大笑话！
    蜜蜂要向我报仇，
    这样的事情哪里有？
    是你，
    我不怕。
    明天我再来，
    我带来一把香火，
    还带来一把鲜花，
    看你喜欢哪一样，让你选一下！
　
    “好，
    小红帽，
    老子今晚眼睛痛，
    暂且饶你再活一夜，
    明晚一定来吃你的肉，喝你的血。”
　
    老山妖，
    双手按着眼睛，
    低着头，
    皱着眉，
    摸摸索索的摸下山去了。
