Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 5th: The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters held its inaugural meeting this afternoon. The establishment of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and New China, and the attendance of the Soviet delegation of cultural, artistic, and scientific workers, who came to Beijing specifically to participate in this meeting, further intensified the expression of friendship between the peoples of the two countries at the meeting.

    More than a thousand people attended today's meeting, including Zhu De, Liu Shaoqi, Soong Ching Ling, Dong Biwu, Guo Moruo, Wu Yuzhang, Li Jishen, Zhang Lan, Gao Gang, He Xiangning, Chen Yun, Shen Junru, Tan Pingshan, Ma Xulun, representatives from various democratic parties, people's organizations, overseas Chinese, various ethnic minorities, and the general and branch associations of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in Northeast China, Shanghai, Hankou, and other places. Soviet friends attending the meeting included the Soviet delegation of cultural, artistic, and scientific workers headed by Fadeyev, and the new Counselor and Chargé d'Affaires of the Soviet Embassy in China, Tikhvinsky. When they entered, the audience erupted in thunderous applause that lasted for a long time. Italian Senator Spano and the Korean People's Delegation also attended.

    Soong Ching Ling delivered the opening address. In her speech, Soong Ching Ling emphasized the many precious friendships and assistance the Soviet Union has given to the Chinese people since its founding, and quoted Mr. Sun Yat-sen: "With the Russian Revolution, a great hope was born for the people of the world." She said, "Now, with the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution and the united cooperation of the two great peoples of China and the Soviet Union, the hope of all mankind is closer to realization. Let us join hands more closely. Let us fight more resolutely. Our strength is incomparably powerful."

    Liu Shaoqi then delivered a report, using the history of the Chinese revolution over the past 30 years and the facts of today to illustrate that the Soviet Union is the best teacher and friend of the Chinese people in the past, present, and future.

    Fadeyev, the head of the Soviet delegation, took the stage to deliver a speech, and his passionate words were met with enthusiastic applause from the audience (for the full text of the speech, see another article). Then, the Soviet delegation presented gifts to the meeting. Markov, Deputy Minister of the Far East Department of the Soviet Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and a member of the delegation, delivered a presentation speech. Dubrovinina, Deputy Minister of Education of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) and another member of the delegation, introduced the overview of Soviet education in a speech. She presented Soviet primary school textbooks to the meeting, and shouted "Long live Chairman Mao Zedong" and "Long live Marshal Stalin" in Chinese, which aroused applause and cheers from the audience.

    Subsequently, He Xiangning, Italian Senator Spano, Korean representative Choi Ho Min, Zhang Lan, Wu Yuzhang, Shao Lizi, Saifuddin and others delivered speeches. In her speech, He Xiangning could not help but burst into tears when she mentioned that Chinese revolutionary martyrs had shed blood and sacrificed themselves for Sino-Soviet friendship for 32 years. She earnestly and excitedly called on Chinese youth to learn from the Soviet Union, saying: "The younger generation must not waste their time. The Soviet Union is the teacher, and our school is the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. We must use our school and humbly ask our teachers to educate us. Students must study hard."
