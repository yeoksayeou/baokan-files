Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 3rd: TASS, Moscow, 2nd: On October 2nd, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko, on behalf of the Soviet government, issued the following statement to the Chargé d'affaires of the Guangzhou government in Moscow: As a result of the profound changes in China's military, political and social life caused by events in China, the People's Republic of China has been established, and the Central People's Government of China has been formed. The government of Mr. Yan Xishan, located in Guangzhou, has ceased to exercise power in China and has become the Guangzhou Provincial Government, losing the possibility of representing China in maintaining diplomatic relations with foreign countries. This situation has led to the severance of diplomatic relations between China and foreign countries.

The Soviet government, taking all these circumstances into consideration, considers that diplomatic relations with Guangzhou have been severed and has decided to recall its diplomatic representatives from Guangzhou.

　　苏联政府发表声明
   　认为与广州外交关系断绝决定自广州召回外交代表
    【新华社北京三日电】塔斯社莫斯科二日电：十月二日，苏联外交部副部长葛罗米柯代表苏联政府向广州政府驻莫斯科代办发表声明如下：由于在中国发生的事件已造成中国的军事、政治与社会生活的深遂变化的结果，中华人民共和国业已成立，中国中央人民政府已经组成，位于广州的阎锡山先生的政府已停止在中国行使权力，并已变成广州省政府而失去了代表中国与外国保持外交关系的可能性。这一情况造成了中国与外国间外交关系的断绝。
    苏联政府考虑到所有这些情况，认为与广州的外交关系已经断绝，并已决定自广州召回其外交代表。
