　　Qinghuayuan Chengzhi School Prepares to Establish Young Pioneers
　　[Report from this newspaper] The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League has issued a decision to establish Young Pioneer teams, and the children of Qinghuayuan are very happy. Chengzhi School is already making specific preparations for the establishment of the teams.
　　After liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Youth League, Chengzhi School's junior high school department established a Young Pioneers team, which currently has thirty-four members. The primary school department established a Children's Corps, which currently has one hundred and forty-four members (some of whom have been promoted to middle school and are preparing to apply to join the Young Pioneers when the teams are established). It has been half a year since the establishment of the Young Pioneers and the Children's Corps. After a long period of exploration and repeated study, especially in the summer vacation school organized by the Communist Youth League and the Student Union, the members clearly realized that the Young Pioneers and the Children's Corps are organizations for the vast number of children, uniting them to study culture and science, and develop healthy bodies and minds. They have played a significant role in mutual assistance in learning.
　　Under the leadership of the Youth League, the preparatory committee for the Young Pioneers of Chengzhi School has now been established, consisting of representatives from each class (two from each class) elected by the original Young Pioneers and three of the original heads of the Children's Corps, as well as some teachers from the school who have been invited to participate in handling the work of establishing the teams, and leading the students applying to join the teams to study documents, report, or discuss. Now, many students are studying enthusiastically, striving to be good young people and good children of the new China!

　　清华园成志学校筹建少年儿童队
    【本报讯】青年团中央委员会发布了建立少年儿童队的决定，清华园的少年儿童们都非常高兴，成志学校已经具体筹备建队。
    解放后成志学校在青年团的领导下，初中部曾成立少年先锋队，现有队员三十四人；小学部曾成立儿童团，现有团员一百四十四人（有几人已升入中学，准备建队时申请入队）。从建队建团到现在已有半年，经过许久的摸索，多次的学习，尤其在暑假青年团与学联举办的暑期学园中，队员团员明确认识到队与团是广大少年儿童的组织，团结少年儿童，学习文化科学，锻炼健康的身心。在学习互助中，起了很大的作用。
    在团的领导下，成志学校少年儿童队的筹委会现已成立，由原少先队选出的各班代表（每班二人）及原儿童团团长三人，并聘请校中一部分教员参加，办理建队工作。并领导申请入队同学，进行文件的学习，报告或讨论。现在很多同学都在热烈学习，争取做一个新中国的好少年，好儿童！
