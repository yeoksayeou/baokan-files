　　The entire region's Three Autumn Campaign, since the beginning of October, has gradually shifted into the autumn plowing phase from north to south.

　　First, leadership organs at all levels emphasized and put forward the autumn plowing work, and made immediate arrangements. The North China Bureau and the North China People's Government issued instructions on September 1st, requiring to exceed last year's autumn plowing area by 70 percent, and to plow all land in the region once, except for muddy areas, and pointed out the favorable conditions and importance of this year's autumn plowing. Based on specific conditions, all provinces stipulated the requirement of plowing once over all land, and made immediate arrangements. During the campaign, inspections were conducted to correct deviations and solve problems. For example, when Chahar Province discovered the tendency of administrative orders and unequal use of livestock in areas such as Yuxian and Yanggao, it immediately corrected them, so that the campaign developed steadily.

　　Due to the general increase in farmers' production enthusiasm after land reform, the cessation of war service, and the good soil moisture due to abundant rain before autumn, the scale of the campaign, according to available materials, has exceeded that of last year. For example, in Suiyuan and northern Chahar, by mid-October, half of the autumn plowing had already been completed. In southern Chahar, Wanquan, Huai'an, and Xuanhua's third district and twelfth district, also completed 50 percent by October 13th. Chicheng completed two-thirds before the 15th. According to statistics in mid-October, the Pingchuan area of Yanbei generally plowed 30 to 40 percent. Shanxi Province basically completed wheat sowing in early October and shifted to autumn plowing. According to statistics from the fourth district of Heshun on October 5th, more than 11,000 mu of land had been plowed. Hebei and Pingyuan provinces, except for the flood-affected areas, basically completed wheat sowing around mid-October and shifted to the autumn plowing movement. According to statistics from Laishui County in mid-October, more than 56,000 mu of land had been plowed.

　　During the autumn plowing, extensive propaganda movements were carried out in various places. For example, Hebei put forward slogans such as "If one household does not plow in autumn, thousands of households will suffer from pests," "Good autumn plowing this year means a good harvest next year," and "The plow does not stop when the ground freezes." Chahar Province proposed "Plow as you harvest," and Shanxi proposed "Harvest one plot, plow one plot," to motivate the masses. At the same time, the benefits of autumn plowing experienced by farmers were repeatedly publicized to educate and mobilize farmers in depth. For example, the Xingtai Special Zone in Hebei put forward the five major benefits of autumn plowing: it can resist drought, allow the land to rest, eliminate pests, turn grass into the ground to act as fertilizer, and fully absorb sunlight.

　　In the case of livestock shortages, various localities adopted the method of plowing as they harvested to extend the autumn plowing time, and also fully organized human and animal power to invest in the autumn plowing movement. In the mountainous areas of Shanxi, where donkeys do not have the habit of wearing harnesses, the slogan "Donkeys wearing harnesses" was put forward this year to go to the fields for autumn plowing. Wanquan County in Chahar Province adopted human-pulled plows and organized male and female labor to hoe the ground to compensate for the shortage of plowing livestock. More importantly, based on the principle of voluntary mutual benefit, protecting the plowing livestock households and not letting them suffer losses, human and animal labor exchange, cooperative plowing, selling land, and contracting were universally organized. For example, Hebei called for the universal adoption of natural forms that are easily accepted by the masses for free combination. In Lujia Yu, Nanguan, and Mujia Hui villages in Xiyang, Shanxi, after specific accounting and equivalent value education, the masses actively exchanged animal labor with manual labor, grain stalks, and corn stalks, or by finding relatives and friends, solving the autumn plowing problems of more than 300 households without livestock.

　　In the new areas where land reform has not been carried out, landlords and rich peasants do not want to plow the land, and some middle peasants are blinded by rumors and have concerns about autumn plowing, which has become an obstacle to the development of the movement. Chahar Province put forward "Whoever harvests, sows"; Shanxi and Chahar Provinces widely publicized the policy of not touching the middle peasants, so that autumn plowing in the new areas could overcome obstacles and move forward.

　　As of now, the Frost's Descent (October 24th) has passed, and in all areas except the cold regions of Chahar and Suiyuan, there are still half a month to a month before the ground freezes. Time is tight, and various places are launching a crash autumn plowing under the slogan "The plow does not stop when the ground freezes" to ensure the completion of the plan to plow once over all land.

### 华北的秋耕运动

　　华北的秋耕运动
    华北人民政府农业部
    全区三秋运动，自十月初，即由北向南，逐渐转入了秋耕阶段。
    首先，各级领导机关强调的提出了秋耕工作，并即时作了布置。华北局与华北人民政府于九月一日发布了指示，要求超过去年百分之七十的秋耕面积，全区除泥淖地以外，普耕一遍，并指出了今年秋耕的有利条件与其重要性。各省根据具体情况，均规定了普耕一遍的要求，并即时作了布置。在运动中，更进行了检查，纠正偏向，解决问题，如察省发现了蔚县、阳高等地发生行政命令及不等价使用牲口的偏向后，立即纠正，使运动稳步的开展起来。
    由于土改后农民生产情绪普遍高涨，战勤停止，秋前雨多垧土好；所以运动的规模，由现有材料看来，已超过去年。如绥远及察哈尔北部，于十月中旬，即已秋耕过半。察南的万全、怀安及宣化三区、十二区，于十月十三日，亦完成百分之五十。赤城十五日以前即完成三分之二。雁北平川在十月中旬的统计，一般也耕到百分之三、四十。山西省于十月初即基本上完成种麦，转入秋耕。据和顺四区十月五日的统计，已耕地一万一千余亩。河北及平原省除水灾区外，在十月中旬前后，基本上完成小麦播种，转入了秋耕运动。涞水县十月中旬的统计，已耕五万六千余亩。
    在秋耕中，各地均开展了广泛的宣传运动。如河北提出了“一家不秋耕，千家受虫害，”“今年秋耕好，明年好收成，”“地不冻犁不停。”察省提出：“随收随耕，”山西提出了：“收一块，耕一块，”等口号鼓动群众情绪。同时并以农民经验到的秋耕好处，反复宣传，教育农民，深入发动。如河北邢台专区提出了：秋耕能抗旱、憩地、消灭虫害；把草翻到地下，可以顶肥料，及能充分吸收阳光的五大好处。
    在畜力缺乏的情况下，各地一方面采取了随收随耕的办法，延长秋耕时间，另一方面又充分的组织了人畜力，投入秋耕运动。山西山区毛驴没有上套习惯，今年提出了“毛驴上套，”下地秋耕。察省万全县采用了人拉犁，组织男女劳力刨地等，以补耕畜的不足。更重要的是在自愿两利、爱护耕畜不叫养耕畜户吃亏的原则下，普遍的组织了人畜变工、合犋、卖垧、包工。如河北号召了普遍采用群众容易接受的自然形式，自由结合。山西昔阳路家峪、南关、穆家会三村，经过具体算帐，等价教育，群众纷纷以人工、谷草、玉茭杆，或找亲朋等方法变换畜工，解决了三百余没畜力户的秋耕问题。
    新区未进行土改，地主富农不想耕地，部分中农受谣言蒙蔽，对秋耕有雇虑，成为运动开展的障碍。察省提出了“谁收谁种”；山西察省均广泛宣传了不动中农的政策，使得新区秋耕，能以扫除障碍，向前发展。
    就目前来说，霜降（十月二十四日）已过，全区除察绥寒冷地区以外，各地距离封土地冻，尚有半月至一月。时间紧迫，各地正在“地不冻犁不停”的口号下，突击秋耕，保证完成普耕一遍的计划。
