Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 21st: TASS, Washington, 20th: Nourse, Chairman of the US President's Council of Economic Advisers, submitted his resignation on the 19th. The White House released Truman's letter accepting the resignation, but did not release the letter of resignation. According to the letter, Nourse's resignation may involve disagreements with the Truman administration's economic policies. Nourse stated in a statement several months ago that the Truman administration had spent huge sums of money to meet military needs. On the 18th of this month, Nourse again criticized the government's huge expenditures for creating a huge treasury deficit.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 21st: Washington Dispatch: The first session of the 81st US Congress adjourned on the 19th. Since the first session of this Congress convened on January 3, it has fully adhered to the intentions of the American monopoly capitalists. On the plans for foreign aggression and the expansion of armaments, it has successively approved the "North Atlantic Treaty," passed the "Second Phase of Marshall Plan Appropriations," the "Mutual Defense Assistance Act of 1949" (that is, the foreign military aid bill to arm the North Atlantic Treaty signatories), the appropriations for the "Point Four Program Act" (that is, the so-called technical "assistance" to backward countries), and the unprecedentedly huge peacetime defense spending appropriations of more than 15 billion US dollars. Conversely, the Congressional session has done nothing on issues of vital interest to the American people. Truman had promised in his election campaign to abolish the Taft-Hartley anti-labor law and pass other bills related to the people's welfare, but Congress took no action.

  　诺尔斯反对庞大军费向杜鲁门请辞职获准
    美国会第一期会休会
    【新华社北京二十一日电】塔斯社华盛顿二十日讯：美总统经济顾问委员会主席诺尔斯于十九日提出辞呈。白宫发表了杜鲁门接受辞职的信件，但并未发表辞职信。看信，诺尔斯的辞职可能涉及杜鲁门政府经济政策问题上的分歧。诺尔斯于数月前曾在其声明中称，杜鲁门政府为应军事的需要，曾支出巨大的费用。本月十八日，诺尔斯又批评政府的庞大支出造成了巨大的国库赤字。
    【新华社北京二十一日电】华盛顿讯：美国第八十一届国会第一期会议，已于十九日休会。本届国会第一期会议自一月三日开会以来，完全秉承美国垄断资本家的意旨，在对外侵略和扩张军备计划上，先后批准了“北大西洋公约”，通过了“马歇尔计划第二期拨款”，“一九四九年联防互助法案”（即武装北大西洋公约缔约国的对外军事援助法案），“第四点计划法案”（即所谓技术“援助”落后国家法案）的拨款，以及美国和平时期空前庞大的一百五十余亿美元的国防费用拨款。相反地，国会会议对于美国人民的切身利益问题，则毫无作为。杜鲁门曾在竞选诺言中提出废除塔夫脱——哈特莱反劳工法，并通过其他有关人民福利的法案，但国会并没有采取任何行动。
