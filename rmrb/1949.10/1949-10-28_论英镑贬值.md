On the Devaluation of the Pound Sterling
    By Kelekefu, Translated by Wen Lian & Xiao Feng
    Recently, newspapers have reported that Washington is pressuring London to devalue the pound. But I recall that in 1930, the devaluation of the pound was an action taken by British monopoly capitalists in their struggle to compete with the United States. What is happening this time?

    Indeed, the form of trade wars waged by capitalist powers in the world market today is fundamentally different from that of 1930. At that time, capitalist countries devalued their currencies to squeeze out their competitors and maintain their exports during the severe depression. Lower exchange rates often provoked protests from competing countries. In 1934, the United States devalued the dollar in retaliation for Britain's earlier devaluation of the pound.

    Today, the situation is completely different. It is not British monopoly capitalists but American monopoly capitalists who are insisting on devaluing the pound. The United States is not at all afraid of increased British export competitiveness.

    The reason for the fundamental change in tactics in the Anglo-American trade war is that, besides the price of exported goods, many other factors play an important role in today's market competition.

    Wall Street's increased pressure on the pound is just one characteristic of its attack on Britain's tottering production and trade system. In the struggle for the United States to seize new markets abroad, its industry is far more advantageous than Britain's.

    First, the United States has a higher level of technology and labor productivity, so American manufacturers have lower production costs. The fact that American workers produce almost twice as much per hour as British workers has always been envied by the magnates of the City of London.

    Second, the United States has had a near-monopoly on capital exports since the war (mainly paid for by the state). This gives American goods a greater impact in foreign markets. Anyone can see that, for example, in the autumn of 1948, more than forty percent of the United States' exports of goods and services, totaling $3.971 billion, were exported by the U.S. government, with very few by private entities. Britain currently does not have the capacity to keep pace with American expansion.

    Third, the United States has a larger domestic market, enabling American monopoly capitalists to engage in large-scale dumping, which is beyond the reach of British competitors. American monopoly capitalists sell many times more in the domestic market than British monopoly capitalists. At the same time, U.S. exports only slightly exceed nine percent of its total production, far lower than Britain's. Britain exports about twenty-five percent. Therefore, if necessary, American manufacturers can stimulate exports by raising prices in the domestic market and lowering prices abroad. The loss is then compensated by American consumers. British exporters cannot do this.

    However, the peculiar situation now is that some of America's advantages are also the source of its weaknesses. The fatal weakness of the American expansion policy is its huge difference between exports and imports, which causes a long-term shortage of dollars in the capitalist world. Therefore, Britain's import surplus—the reason for Britain's economic fragility—is, in a sense, an asset.

    The United States itself produces an extraordinary abundance of staple foods and raw materials, while Britain buys considerable quantities of both; in fact, Britain is the largest importer in the capitalist world. The United States exports twice as much as it imports. But the situation in Britain is the opposite; it buys far more in foreign markets than it sells.

    The United States ranks first among capitalist exporting countries, far surpassing Britain. In the first three months of this year, the total value of U.S. exports was $3.242 billion, while Britain's was $1.852 billion. At the same time, Britain led in import volume. It bought goods worth $2.168 billion, while U.S. imports were $1.767 billion.

    Britain's fatal trade deficit is inseparable from this disparity in its position in the world market. But it seems hard to believe that this gives Britain a weapon to resist the competitive pressure from the United States.

    The United States is doing its best to restrict the import of goods from countries to which it exports. Britain, on the other hand, is happy to buy the food and raw materials that its industrial customers can supply. In other words, it consolidates its position in the world market with its own imports, and enters into bilateral agreements (such as the recent agreement with Argentina, which displeased Wall Street). The decisive factor that is beneficial to it is not the low price, but the possibility of mutual exports.

    British exporters have consistently taken advantage of this. As a result, British exports have increased by fifty percent in the past two years, while U.S. exports, despite the Marshall Plan and more attractive prices, have fallen by one-third. Even so, in the current export struggle, American monopoly capitalists will eventually win. Earlier this year, U.S. export volume was twice as high as before the war, while Britain's was only half of what it was before the war. As the economic crisis intensifies day by day, Wall Street wants to give a decisive blow to its main rival in the world market.

    This is the purpose behind the current plan to devalue the pound. The basis of Britain's bilateral agreements is the fixed exchange rate of the pound and its non-convertibility. Otherwise, countries that sell food and raw materials to Britain could convert pounds into dollars and buy machinery and industrial products in the United States, because American goods are cheaper and can be granted credit, etc. American monopoly capitalists link the demand for devaluation of the pound with the restoration of convertibility so that they can snatch away Britain's current customers.

    The United States, using the Marshall Plan as a tool, has forced Britain and other Western European countries to only buy American goods, without giving them the opportunity to export an equal amount to the dollar area. The trade relations between Western European countries and Eastern Europe have been destroyed by various prohibitive measures, which have doomed Britain to a long-term shortage of dollars, causing it to suffer increasing economic difficulties, and paving the way for American expansionists to invade Britain's traditional markets.

    The devaluation of the pound and the restoration of its convertibility with gold and dollars will be another big step in this direction. Wall Street wants to have such an arrangement that Britain imports food and raw materials from various countries, while the United States can replace Britain in exporting industrial products to these countries. To achieve this goal, American monopoly capitalists are prepared to risk a certain degree of improvement in the competitiveness of British goods due to the devaluation of the pound. They want to challenge British industry under the so-called multilateral trade conditions; because they are convinced that in any case, they can offer lower prices, thus giving a powerful blow to the entire British export system. At the same time, lowering the prices of British goods imported into the United States, such as rubber and tin, will be a direct benefit to American monopoly capitalists. Only some American businessmen, who are less confident in their own strength, fear the adverse consequences that may be caused by the devaluation of the pound and the resulting increase in British export competitiveness.

    Another very important reason why American financial oligarchs insist on devaluing the pound is that it clears the way for the United States to buy its industries at low prices and further enslave Western Europe economically. In this regard, the devaluation of European currencies has given American usurers unlimited opportunities. (For details, please refer to the article "The Dead End of the Marshall Plan" in the 29th issue of New Era this year.)

    Therefore, the conflict between Britain and the United States over the devaluation of the pound is a prominent manifestation of the intensification of the overall opposition between these two major powers after the war. This is not just an ordinary monetary dispute, but a contradiction of irreconcilable interests, and its outcome will determine whether Britain remains a first-class industrial and exporting power. Both sides are constantly trying to portray the current struggle as a search for new ways of "cooperation," the purpose of which is to deceive British and American public opinion; but the increasingly sharp disputes on both sides of the Atlantic once again illustrate the futility of this attempt.

    The development of the economic crisis is like adding fuel to the fire of the Anglo-American contradictions. As early as the beginning of 1948, that is, even before the industrial production began to shrink, the decline in exports of capitalist countries had already intensified the economic struggle. This has prompted them to become more hostile, and at the same time, it is the main explanation for why the struggle between British and American monopoly capitalists over the devaluation of the pound is so fierce.

    The entire economic foundation of the Marshall Plan is tottering. The decline in British production and the shrinking of the American domestic market have reduced Britain's originally small exports to the United States. And these exports are continuing to decline. In 1948, the average was 5.9 million pounds per month. The total for April, May, and June of 1949 was 3.3 million, 3.6 million, and 3 million pounds, respectively. In order to deal with the expulsion of British goods from the U.S. imperialist market, the British government decided to "delay" the purchase of dollars as much as possible, and to reduce the amount of purchases from the dollar area in 1949-1950 by a quarter, or 100 million gold pounds.

    The trade relations painstakingly established by the Marshall Plan collapsed before the eyes of the world. Trade relations are not developing as loudly publicized, but the disputes between the Anglo-American camps are becoming increasingly fierce. The "Western European Economic Cooperation" plan cannot withstand the first blow of the uncontrollable contradictions of capitalism.

    The American advocates of the Marshall Plan eagerly hoped for unlimited expansion, but their fate is disappointment. Wall Street's "arrogant demands for leadership in the world economic organization" have been proven by facts to be unfounded and ridiculous. This is the first conclusion drawn from the quarrel over the devaluation of the pound.

    The London assistants of the Marshall Plan have also suffered the same disappointment. As British Chancellor of the Exchequer Mr. Cripps announced, the dollar shortfall was 82 million pounds this spring, and reached 157 million pounds in the summer. The hard currency reserves in the pound area fell from 471 million pounds on March 31 to 406 million pounds on June 30. Given the facts, the United States, Britain's benefactor, wants Britain to devalue the pound, just like putting a loaded gun in the hands of a suicide. Britain, in order to escape its difficulties, established an imperialist alliance with the extremely reactionary forces of American financial capital, resulting in Britain falling into a long-foreseen state. This is the second conclusion.

    Britain's imports exceed its exports, so the devaluation of the pound is indeed a "dangerous medicine" for it, as the Conservative Party's "Yorkshire Post" said. The newspaper vividly described the dangers involved in the devaluation of the pound:

    "Currently, one pound is worth about four dollars. Suppose the devaluation is to three dollars; then every American buyer of British goods will not pay more than three dollars instead of four as before. Obviously, it would be much easier to sell goods in the United States. But there are also dangers. The immediate danger is that the cost of imports will increase; goods that are now worth four dollars only cost one pound, but if devalued as above, they will cost one pound, six shillings, and eight pence. Although there is the benefit of selling more goods, there is the drawback of higher import costs."

    From this, the "Yorkshire Post" concludes:

    "After the devaluation, all the inputs used to manufacture export goods (this number is very large) will make these exports more expensive, and therefore more difficult to sell abroad. To overcome this difficulty, there will inevitably be another devaluation. This is a 'dangerous medicine,' and eating it all the time can be fatal."

    Therefore, British capitalists fully understand that the devaluation of the pound is of no benefit to them. It should be remembered that during the economic crisis from 1929 to 1933, the price of raw materials imported from overseas by Britain fell more than the price of its exports; therefore, British monopoly capitalists could take advantage of the lower exchange rates. But the situation is different now, because the increase in raw material prices is greater than the increase in British export prices.

    After the uproar between Britain and the United States over the devaluation of the pound during U.S. Treasury Secretary Snyder's visit to Europe, it temporarily calmed down. The Washington financial conference is expected to be held in September. Judging from all the symbols, the United States will launch another possibly decisive offensive.

    It is worth noting that newspapers reported that British rulers have different opinions on this matter. According to reports, after Snyder's visit, Cripps asked for leave. He was against the devaluation of the pound, but Bevin thought that he could agree to the American demands. Obviously, the policy of surrendering to U.S. imperialism has its own cruel logic and does not allow for halfway measures.

    Our Soviet Union and people's democratic countries, in contrast to the reduction in production and the shrinkage of foreign trade in capitalist countries, are continuously and massively increasing production, and international trade relations are becoming stronger and wider. The trade volume between the United States and the Western European Marshall Plan countries is declining sharply; while the trade volume between Western European countries in 1948 was less than three-quarters (i.e. 72 percent) of what it was before the war. However, the trade volume between the people's democratic countries and between them and the Soviet Union in 1948 was almost three times (288 percent) that of 1938 before the war.

    These facts and figures show how completely bankrupt the reactionary policies of the pitiful rulers of Western Europe are. Due to their mistakes, the trade volume between Eastern Europe and Western Europe in 1948 was less than half (42 percent) of what it was before the war. These rulers, blinded by their narrow, selfish class motives, destroyed the restoration of trade between Eastern and Western Europe under American pressure. However, as a result of this policy, they have given and are giving their own countries enormous damage. (Translated from New Era, issue 35)

　　论英镑贬值
    柯勒可夫著  文涟、小凤合译
    近来报纸上报导华盛顿压迫伦敦贬低英镑价值，但是在我记忆里，一九三○年的英镑汇率降低是英国独占资本家们为了与美国竞争在斗争中采取的一个行动，可是这次又是怎么回事？
    西多洛夫问
    ×　　　　　　×　　　　　　×　　　　　　×
    的确，现在资本主义强国们在世界市场上所进行的贸易战争的形式与一九三○年根本不同。在那时，资本主义国家使他们的货币贬值，借以排挤他们的竞争者而维持他们在严重恐慌中的输出。较低的汇价常常引起竞争国家纷纷抗议。一九三四年美国曾降低美元汇价来报复英国稍先的英镑贬价。
    今天的情景却迥然不同。坚持压低英镑价值的不是英国独占资本家而是美国独占资本家。美国是完全不怕英国出口竞争能力的增加了。
    引起英美贸易战争战术上基本变化的原因，除了出口货物价格外，许多别的因素，在今天市场竞争中，占重要地位。
    华尔街对英镑增加压力，是它对英国摇摇欲坠的生产与贸易制度之打击底一个特征而已。在美国攫取国外新市场的斗争中，它的工业远较英国为有利。
    首先，美国有较高的技术水平和劳动生产力，因此美国的厂商的生产成本较低。美国工人每小时生产几乎两倍于英国的这一事实，一贯是为伦敦城的大亨们所忌羡的。
    其次，美国自战后差不多完全垄断了资本的输出（主要是由国家付出）。因此就使得美货在国外市场上有更大的冲击力量。任何人都可以看到，例如一九四八年秋季，百分之四十以上的美国商品与服务的输出，总值为三十九亿七千一百万美元，除极少数为私人者外，均为美国国家所输出。英国在目前没有能力与美国的扩张并驾齐驱了。
    第三，美国有较大的国内市场，使得美国独占资本家们能进行为英国竞争者们所不及的大量倾销。美国独占资本家们销售于国内市场的，要较英国独占资本家们多数倍。同时美国出口量只不过约略超过它总生产量的百分之九，远较英国为低。英国输出，约占百分之二十五。于是，如有需要，美国厂家是可以借抬高国内市场售价，降低国外售价来刺激输出。其损失，则取偿于美国消费者。而英国出口商们是不能这样的。
    但是，现在的奇特情形是美国某些有利条件却同时又是它弱点的来源。美国扩张政策的致命的弱点，是它输出与输入之间的巨大差额，使得资本主义世界长期缺乏美元。因而英国的入超——使英国经济脆弱的原因——在一定意义上却是一种资产。
    美国本身生产了异常丰富的主要食物和原料，而英国对这两者都买进相当的数量；事实上，英国是资本主义世界中的最大进口国家。美国输出两倍于输入。可是英国的情形正相反，在国外市场购进的远超过售出的。
    美国在资本主义出口国家中占第一位，比英国超过很多。今年头三个月中，美国输出总值三十二亿四千二百万美元，而英国则为十八亿五千二百万美元。与此同时，输入量却以英国为首。它买进的货物达二十一亿六千八百万美元，而美国的输入则为十七亿六千七百万美元。
    英国贸易上致命的入超，与世界市场地位上的这种地位悬殊是分不开的。但是似乎难以相信，这却给英国抵抗美国竞争压力的一件武器。
    美国极力限制本国出口对象国家底货物向美输入。英国却相反，对于购买本国工业的主顾们所能供给的粮食和原料，却是乐于购买的。换句话说，它以它自己的输入，来巩固它在世界市场的地位，订立双边协定（如象最近引起华尔街不高兴的与阿根庭的协定），对它有利的决定性的因素，不是低廉的售价，而是互相输出底可能性。
    英国的出口家们一直成功地利用了这一优点。结果，英国的出口在过去的两年中增加了百分之五十，而美国的输出，虽然有着马歇尔计划以及更能吸引人的售价，却下跌了三分之一。纵然如此，在目前的出口斗争中，美国的独占资本家们最后会赢得胜利，今年初，美国出口量两倍于战前，而英国的却只有战前的一半。由于经济危机日甚一日，华尔街要给予其世界市场上的主要敌手以决定性的打击。
    这就是目前英镑贬值计划背后的目的。英国的双边协定的基础是英镑固定的汇率以及其不能兑换。否则，卖粮食和原料给英国的各国就能将英镑换成美元，在美国购买机器与工业品，因美国货价格较廉，且能给予信用贷款等等。美国的独占资本家把要求英镑贬值和恢复兑换联系起来，使其能把英国目前的主顾抢过来。
    以马歇尔计划为工具的美国，已经强使英国和其他西欧国家只能买美国的商品，而不给它们机会对美元区域做等量的出口，西欧各国与东欧的贸易关系被各种禁止的措施破坏了，这些就注定了英国长期缺乏美元，使它遭到日甚一日的经济困难，而铺平了美国扩张主义者侵入英国传统市场的道路。
    英镑贬值以及恢复它与金元的兑换，将是向这方面走的又一大步骤。华尔街想要有这样的安排，即，英国从各个不同的国家输进粮食和原料，而美国能代替英国向这些国家输出工业品。为达到这目的，美国的独占资本家准备冒险让英国商品竞争能力因英镑贬价而有某种程度上的提高。他们要在所谓多边贸易的条件下，向英国工业挑战；因为确信在任何情况下，他们能提供更低的价格，因而给英国的整个输出体系以有力的打击。同时，降低英国输入美国的货品价格，如橡胶和锡之类，对美国的独占资本家将是一个直接利益。只有某些对自己力量比较无信心的美国商人，惧怕着英镑贬值后以及因此而使英国出口竞争能力提高可能引起的不利的后果。
    美国金融寡头坚持英镑贬值的另一个很重要的原因，是它扫清了道路，使美国能以贱价收买其工业，进一步地在经济上奴役西欧。在这方面，欧洲货币的贬值给了美国高利贷者以无限的好机会。（详情请参阅今年第二十九期新时代“马歇尔计划的死路”一文。）
    因此，英美在英镑贬值事件上的冲突，是这两大强国战后总的对立加剧的突出表现。这不仅是普通的货币的争执，而是不可调和的利益矛盾，它的结局如何，将决定英国是否仍为工业的及输出的头等强国。双方不断努力将目前的搏斗描绘成为找寻新的“合作”方式，其目的在欺骗英国和美国的舆论；可是大西洋两岸争执之日趋尖锐，再一次说明了这种企图的徒然。
    经济危机的发展，对英美的矛盾，有如火上加油。早在一九四八年初，就是说，甚至在工业生产开始缩减以前，资本主义国家输出之下跌，已经使经济斗争尖锐化了。这就促使他们更加敌对，同时是英美独占资本家在英镑贬值问题上的斗争为何如此猛烈之主要解释。
    马歇尔计划的整个经济基础，正摇摇欲坠。英国生产的下降，以及美国国内市场的缩小，减低了英国对美国原来已小的输出。而且这些输出正继续下降。在一九四八年，平均每个月五百九十万镑，一九四九年四、五、六三月的总数，则为三百三十万，三百六十万、和三百万镑。为了对付英货从美帝市场上的被驱逐，英国政府决定尽量“延迟”用美元的购买，并且将一九四九——一九五○年从美元区域的购买数量减少四分之一，或一亿金镑。
    马歇尔计划辛辛苦苦建立起来的贸易关系，在全世界目赌之下垮台了。贸易关系不是象大加渲染那样的发展，而是英美阵营间的争执日甚一日，“西欧经济合作”计划，抵挡不住资本主义的无法控制的矛盾之第一次打击。
    马歇尔计划的美国倡导者们，热切希望无限制的扩张，但他们的命运是失望。华尔街对“世界经济组织领导地位的狂妄的要求，已被事实证明为没有根据的与可笑的。这就是关于英镑贬值的争吵所得出的第一个结论。
    马歇尔计划的伦敦助手们，也遭到同样的失望。如英国财政大臣克利浦斯先生宣布，今年春季美元不敷为八千二百万镑，而夏季即达一亿五千七百万镑。英镑区域的硬币准备，从三月三十一日的四亿七千一百万镑，跌到六月三十的四亿零六百万镑。事实既然如此，英国的恩人美国想法叫英国将英镑贬值，好比是拿一支装好子弹的手枪放于自杀者的手里。英国为了要逃出它的困难，而与美国金融资本极端反动势力建立帝国主义的联合，结果使英国陷于早已料到的地步。这是第二个结论。
    英国的入口超过它的出口，因此英镑贬值对它确是一服“危险的药”，保守党的“约克郡邮报”如是说。该报很生动的描写英镑贬值所包含的危险：
    “目前每英镑大约值四美元。假定贬值为三美元；于是英国货的每一个美国买主，以前每付四元的，现在就不会付比三美元还多。很明显，在美国销货就大为方便。但是也有危险。立即的危险，就是输入品代价将增加；现在价值四美元的货只要一英镑，但如按上述贬值后，就要一镑六先令八便士。虽然有销货较多之利，但却有输入品代价较高之弊。”
    由此，“约克郡邮报”得出如下结论：
    “贬值后，所有用于制造出口货的输入品（这数目是很大的），将使这些输出品价钱更高，因此更难于在国外出售。要克服这一困难，势必将又来一次贬值。这是一服‘危险的药’，老是吃它是可以致命的”
    所以英国资本家们完全明白英镑贬值于他们无益。应当记着：当一九二九年至一九三三年经济危机时，英国自海外输入的原料价格的低落程度比它输出品价格的低落程度要大；因此，英国独占资本家们降低汇率，能占便宜。但现在的情形不同，因为原料价格的提高，比英国输出品价格的提高为大。
    在美国财政部长史奈德访欧时英美间关于英镑贬值问题的喧闹之后，暂时平静下来。华盛顿的财政会议，预计九月举行。据所有的象征来作推测，美国将进行另一个可能是决定性的进攻。
    值得注意的是，报纸报导英国统治人物对于此事意见不一。报载在史奈德访问之后，克利浦斯就请假，他是反对英镑贬值，可是贝文认为可以同意美国的要求。很明显的，投降美帝的政策，是有其自己残酷的逻辑，不许半途而废的。
    我们苏联及人民民主国家，与资本主义国家生产之降低及国外贸易之缩减相反，生产不断大量提高，国际贸易关系日益加强和扩大。美国与西欧马歇尔计划国家间的贸易额，正在急剧下降；而西欧国家一九四八年互相间的贸易额，不及战前四分之三（即百分之七十二）。但是，人民民主国家间以及它们与苏联间一九四八年的贸易额，差不多为战前一九三八年的三倍（百分之二百八十八。）
    这些事实与数字，说明了西欧可怜的统治者们的反动政策如何完全破产。由于他们的错误，东欧与西欧间一九四八年的贸易额，还不及战前的一半（百分之四十二）。这些统治者们为自己窄狭的、自私的阶级动机所蒙蔽，在美国压力下，破坏了东欧西欧间贸易的恢复。但，由于这种政策，他们已经给并正在给自己的国家莫大的损害。（译自新时代三十五期）
