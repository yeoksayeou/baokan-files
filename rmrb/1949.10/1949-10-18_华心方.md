Hua Xinfang
    Slow Flight

　　Years of arduous labor have etched deep wrinkles on his tanned face. Tall and slightly stooped, he has a sturdy and powerful build. Beneath his thick, dark eyebrows, a simple, honest smile often appears.

　　This is Hua Xinfang, a man who loves the People's Liberation Army. He is fifty-four years old this year, with only two *sheng* of mountain land to his name. He ekes out a living for his family by cultivating four *dou* of land belonging to landlords and chopping firewood. For decades, he endured the exploitation and oppression of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, fostering intense class hatred. It wasn't until 1931, when the Communist Party's predecessor, the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, arrived in the Dabie Mountains, that he finally met his kin!

　　When the Red Army was in the Dabie Mountains, they lacked food. He supplied them with all his grain and sought help from relatives and friends to alleviate the army's food shortage. His home was constantly filled with wounded Red Army soldiers. He mobilized his entire family to care for them patiently, tirelessly helping the wounded soldiers change bandages, dress wounds, and feed them. His home became a temporary "supply station" and "sanatorium" for the Red Army.

　　Not only that, but he was also the Red Army's most responsible courier. On one occasion, he delivered a message for the troops in the middle of the night, groping his way over mountains. He fell on a rock, and his head was broken, but he endured the pain and delivered the letter to the designated location.

　　After the Red Army left, the reactionaries came to the Dabie Mountains, trying to extract information about the Red Army from Hua Xinfang. Hua Xinfang endured all the extortion and threats, refusing to utter a single word. In the end, the bandits took away a load of tung oil from him.

　　Two years ago, the People's Liberation Army came to the Dabie Mountains. Many people were afraid that the troops would come and go again, so they dared not approach them. But Hua Xinfang didn't care. When the troops were trapped on the mountain, he carried hot meals and secretly delivered them up the mountain via small paths. When the troops moved again, they left five wounded soldiers in his home. Lacking clothes to change into, he gave his own clothes to the wounded soldiers. He himself, shirtless, gathered medicinal herbs such as daylily roots, safflower grass, and fish mint in the hot sun to treat his comrades. He healed a total of three wounded soldiers, and at night, he collected their urine and feces with a chamber pot.

　　When the grain was used up and he couldn't borrow any, he sold over twenty pounds of piglets without hesitation, using the money to buy rice for the comrades, while his own family ate vegetable gruel.

　　One day, the enemy came to search the mountain, which worried him greatly. He quickly carried the wounded soldiers up the mountain and hid them in the bushes. When carrying the last one, he was exhausted, sweating profusely, and his old eyes blurred, and he fell down. But he quickly turned around, letting the wounded soldier fall on top of him.

　　The cunning enemy heard that the Hua family was hiding People's Liberation Army soldiers. Knowing that they couldn't get anything out of Hua Xinfang, they arrested his wife and widowed sister-in-law. Hua Xinfang solemnly told them, "No matter what, don't say a word!" Sure enough, the enemy interrogated them repeatedly, but couldn't get any information. Finally, the enemy became enraged and ordered Hua Xinfang to be captured and buried alive! But he had already moved the wounded soldiers to another location and had hidden himself in the mountains.

　　Due to his tenacious persistence, he ultimately preserved the lives of the wounded soldiers. It wasn't until the large army crossed the Yangtze River that the people of the Dabie Mountains truly saw the light of day. The Hua Xinfang family was finally able to live in peace.

　　When comrades praised him for his past help to the People's Liberation Army, he said, "It is our duty to help the Communist Party!" He deeply understood that without the Communist Party, the people would never be able to turn over, and neither would he.

　　华心方
    缓飞
    许多年劳碌的生活，在那棕黑的脸上刻划下许多深深的绉纹，高大微伛的身材，结实有力的臂膀，浓黑的眉毛下常常现出一种淳朴的忠厚的微笑。
    这便是热爱人民解放军的华心方。他今年五十四岁了，家里仅有二升种的山地，另外靠着种地主的四斗种与砍山柴来维持他一家的生活。几十年来，在蒋介石匪帮的剥削、压迫下，使他有着强烈的阶级仇恨。直到民国二十年，大别山来了共产党解放军的前身——工农红军，他才遇见了亲人！
    红军在大别山的时候，缺乏食粮，他把自己所有粮食供给部队，并想办法向亲友告借来维持部队的粮荒。家里不断的住着受伤的红军士兵，他动员全家人耐心服侍，日夜不息的帮助伤员换药、包扎、喂饭，他家成了红军的临时“供给处”，“休养所”。
    不仅这样，他更是红军最负责的通讯员；有一次，他半夜替部队送信，摸索着翻山越岭，一交跌在石头上，头碰破了，他忍着痛把信送到指定的地点。
    红军走了，反动派又来大别山，他们想从华心方嘴里掏出一些红军的消息来。华心方忍受着一切敲诈、威胁始终不吐出一个字，最后匪徒们弄走了他的一担桐油。
    前年大别山来了人民解放军，很多人怕部队来了又走，都不敢靠近部队。华心方却不管，队伍被困在山上，他挑了热饭，偷偷的由小路送上山去。部队又移动了，在他家里留下五个伤员，没有衣服换，他拿自己的衣服给伤员换，自己隙光着膊子，在炎热的太阳下采金针根、红花草、鱼心草等草药，替同志们医治，一共医好了三个伤员，夜里拿着尿壶替伤员接屎接尿。
    粮食吃光了，借也借不到，他毫不惋惜地卖了二十多斤的小猪，买了米来给同志们吃，自己家里却吃着野菜糊。
    一天，敌人上来搜山，这可急坏了他，他连忙背起伤员爬上山，藏到草丛里；当背到最后一个时，他累很了，大汗直流，老眼一花倒了下去，可是他急忙一转身，让伤员跌在自己的身上。
    狡滑的敌人，听说华家藏有解放军，他们知道在华心方嘴里问不出的，遂把他的老婆和守寡的弟媳捉去，华心方严肃的告诉她俩：“任死你不要说出一字来！”果然，敌人再三拷打也问不出什么来，最后敌人怒极了，下命令一定要把华心方捉住活埋掉！可是他早把伤员移动了一个地方，而自己也躲到山里去了。
    由于他顽强不屈的坚持，终保全了伤员的生命，一直到大军过江前，大别山人民才真的见了天。华心方家也才安心地过日子。
    当同志们颂扬他过去对解放军的帮助时，他说：“咱们帮助共产党做事是应该的！”他深深的理解没有共产党，人民就永远翻不了身，他也翻不了身。
