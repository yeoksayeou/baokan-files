　　Winter Coal Briquettes for Beijing Cooperative Members
  　New Unified Supply Method
    [Reported by this newspaper] The winter coal problem of more than 200,000 cooperative members in Beijing has been resolved with a unified approach after more than a month of research and preparation, and two days of meetings and discussions. 1. Production and Operation: The method of processing for the general cooperative is cancelled, and each cooperative will operate independently. It is not allowed to sell to non-members, and the municipal general cooperative will coordinate when supply and demand are unbalanced. 2. Supply of Raw Coal: The general cooperative will prepare a three-month coal usage plan and submit it to the Coal and Iron Company for supply. Cooperatives operating coal briquette factories should fill out a coal usage plan and go to the company to obtain coal with an introduction from the general cooperative, paying in cash at a 5% discount, or on credit at a 4% discount, and based on the price seven days before the payment date. Payments can also be made at any time to banks (Cooperative, People's, China), and the bank receipt can be used to register the account with the company. In principle, credit sales are for seven days, with a maximum of one month for settlement. 3. Supply Method: Members of each consumer cooperative can register at a nearby coal briquette factory (regardless of district boundaries) with their membership card to become a coal briquette member. The coal briquette factory will stamp the back of the membership card with a mark, and purchases can be made with the card (membership cards must not be transferred). 4. Supply Quantity: Those with one to three people can buy 300 catties per month, and those with four or more people can buy 90 catties per person per month. All payments must be made in cash, and delivery is provided for purchases of 100 catties or more. 6. Issue distribution maps and tables of coal briquette factories for each grassroots cooperative, as well as "Member Distribution Survey Forms" to facilitate member purchases and strengthen the planning and timeliness of production and distribution.

　　京市合作社员冬用煤球
  　新订统一供应办法
    【本报讯】北京市二十余万合作社员的冬季煤炭问题，经过月余的研究筹备及两天的开会讨论，现已定出统一办法。一、生产和经营：取消给总社加工的办法，改为各社独立经营，不准卖给非社员，供求失调时由市总社调剂。二、原煤之供应：由总社造具三个月用煤计划交煤铁公司负责供给。经营煤球厂的合作社填报用煤计划，经总社介绍到公司取煤，现款购买九五扣，赊购九六扣，并按交款日前七天价格计算，还可随时到银行（合作、人民、中国）交款，持银行收据到公司注帐。原则上赊销七天，最多一月清帐。三、供给办法：各消费社社员，可持自己的社员证到附近的煤球厂登记（不分区界）作为煤球社员。由煤球厂在社员证背面加盖图记，凭证购买（社员证不得转借）。四、供给数量：一人至三人者每月可买三百斤，四人以上每人每月九十斤。一律现款，百斤以上管送。六、制发各基层社煤球厂分布图、表及“社员分布调查表”、以便利社员购买，并加强生产分配的计划性和时间性。
