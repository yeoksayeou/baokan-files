　　On Cigarette Tax Regulations
　　Q&A from the North China Tax Bureau

Editor:
　　We are workers engaged in hand-rolled cigarette production. We have some questions regarding the new cigarette tax regulations and would be grateful for your clarification:
　　1. Previously, for hand-rolled cigarettes, a tax stamp of 1.2 yuan was required for each box of ten cigarettes, and 2.4 yuan for each box of twenty cigarettes, allowing free sale in the market. Now, the local tax bureau is imposing a 60% ad valorem tax before sales are permitted. How does this reconcile with the information published in your "Inquiry and Reply" column on September 4th, which stated that for the August tax rate, each box of twenty cigarettes would be taxed at only 20 yuan, after which a tax stamp and inspection would permit sales?
　　2. Previously, hand-rolled cigarette businesses that complied with registration regulations paid commercial tax (seasonally) in addition to affixing sufficient tax stamps. Will commercial tax still be required after the implementation of the new tax regulations? If not, when will the payment of commercial tax be discontinued?
　　3. In Fuping, a considerable amount of tobacco is produced, which is then made into cigarettes for resale. Many local residents (95% of whom are female workers or elderly women) rely on this for their livelihood. If the cigarette industry is forced to shut down due to tax regulations, farmers will not be able to sell their tobacco for food, and these female workers will lose their jobs without any opportunities for re-employment. Are there any other ways to improve this situation?
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Hebei Province, Fuping, Yuan Yu Fan, Hao Jin He

Mr. Yuan Yu Fan and Mr. Hao Jin He:
　　Your questions are answered as follows:
　　1. In the old liberated areas of North China, cigarette taxes were previously levied on a graduated scale based on quantity. Hand-rolled cigarettes were classified as Class C, with a tax of 1.2 yuan for each box containing ten cigarettes and 2.4 yuan for each box containing twenty cigarettes, paid via tax stamps for sale. This year, it was stipulated that, starting in August, a uniform ad valorem tax rate of 60% would be levied. Now, the North China People's Government has announced in the Goods Tax Regulations on September 22nd that the tax rate for cigarettes is 100% for machine-made and semi-machine-made cigarettes, and 80% for hand-rolled cigarettes. From the date of promulgation, cigarettes within the North China region shall be taxed according to the new tax rates.
　　2. The 60% ad valorem tax mentioned in the first question of the original letter (Note: This was the tax rate in the old liberated areas before September 21st; currently, the rate for hand-rolled cigarettes has been revised to 80%) should be calculated based on the market wholesale price using a formula to determine the tax payable. The formula is: "Wholesale Price ÷ (1 + Tax Rate) = Taxable Price." The taxable price multiplied by the tax rate equals the tax payable. As for the report in the September 4th newspaper that the tax per box of hand-rolled cigarettes was 20 yuan, this was the tax amount in Beijing in August. At that time, the wholesale price for each large case (50,000 cigarettes) was 136,900 yuan, which was calculated using the same formula. The taxable price was 59,524 yuan (Note: At that time, the new regulations had not yet been promulgated, and the old tax rate of 120% was temporarily used. The North China People's Government, in consideration of the circumstances, approved a 30% discount in April of this year, making the tax rate 84%). The tax amount was 50,000 yuan, which, when converted to the tax per small box of twenty cigarettes, is 20 yuan.
　　3. After hand-rolled cigarette businesses comply with registration regulations, the tax they pay for producing and selling cigarettes is a goods tax. There is no "commercial tax" designation within the tax regulations. The "seasonal commercial tax" mentioned is likely the industrial and commercial tax within the direct tax category. Anyone engaged in industrial or commercial activities has an obligation to pay industrial and commercial tax. Goods tax and industrial and commercial tax are two distinct types of taxes. Goods tax is an indirect tax, with goods as the taxable object, and is passed on to consumers. Industrial and commercial tax is a direct tax, with industrial and commercial operators as the taxable object, and is borne by those engaged in industrial and commercial activities. Therefore, they should be paid separately.
　　4. The cigarette industry is not beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood. Under the overall tax policy, it is not to be encouraged. We are preparing to transition hand-rolled cigarette businesses to production activities that are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood as much as possible. However, in order to take care of those who cannot easily transition for the time being, we have not strictly banned it and have stipulated a lower tax rate. Local tax authorities and industrial and commercial authorities will assist them in gradually transitioning (The Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the State Taxation Administration jointly issued instructions on August 20th of this year).

Editor:
I am a small merchant who sells cigarettes. I buy cigarettes with tax stamps already affixed from cigarette manufacturers for retail sale. Do I still need to pay the new 60% ad valorem tax? Please advise!
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Sun Geng Shen

Mr. Sun Geng Shen:
　　If the cigarettes you have in stock are from the old liberated areas and have already had the tax stamps of the old area tax bureau affixed according to the quantity-based tax system, you do not need to pay the 60% ad valorem tax again.

### 关于纸烟税则　华北税务总局答问

专栏：询问答复

　　关于纸烟税则
  　华北税务总局答问编者先生：
    我们是手工卷烟的工人，对于新近纸烟税则有些不明白的地方，请分神给解答一下：
    一、原先手工业烟十支装每盒贴税票一元二角，二十支装每盒贴税票二元四角，即可自由行销于市。现今当地税局按从价要征百分之六十方准销售，怎么贵报九月四日询问与答复栏内刊登本年八月份税额二十支装每盒只征二十元即算完税、发贴查验证就能销售？
    二、原先手工卷烟业者遵章登记，除照章贴足税票外，还得完纳商业税（分季节的）；如实行新税则后，商业税是否完纳？或是在什么时候停止完纳？
    三、在我们阜平多少产一部分烟叶，制成纸烟再行转卖、本地赖此谋生者（百分之九十五，是女工或老妇）不在少数，如果因为税则关系以致卷烟行业停止，农民所产烟叶不能变购食粮，赖此为生的女工们，又没有转业的良机，就要失业，这有没有其他改善办法？
    　　　　　　　　河北省阜平袁玉范郝金和袁玉范郝金和先生：
    所询问题兹分别答复如下：
    一、华北老解放区卷烟过去是从量分级课税，手工卷烟属于丙级，每盒内装十支烟征一元二角，二十支征二元四角，粘贴税证销售，本年又经规定自八月份起，一律改按从价百分之六十税率征收。现华北人民政府于九月二十二日公布货物税条例内，规定卷烟税率，机制半机制烟为百分之百，手工卷烟为百分之八十，此后华北区内纸烟应自公布日起，一律按新税率征收。
    二、原函内第一项所问从价征收百分之六十的税（注：此系九月二十一日以前老区的税率，目前已改订手工卷烟为百分之八十）是应按市场批发价通过公式计算应纳税额，其公式为“批价÷（１＋税率）＝完税价格”，用税率乘完税价即为应纳税额。至于九月四日报载手工卷烟每盒纳税二十元，系北京市内八月份的税额，那时每大箱（五万枝）批发价为一三六、九○○元，是依旧公式计算的，其完税价格为五九、五二四元（注：当时新条例未公布，暂沿用旧税率为百分之一百二十，华北人民政府为照顾计，在本年四月份准以七折计算，则税率便为百分之八十四），税额为五○、○○○元，如果折成二十支每小盒的税即为二十元。
    三、手工卷烟业遵章登记后，其制售卷烟所完纳的税，系属货物税，在税则内并无商业税的名称，其所说分季节的商业税，想系直接税中的工商业税，凡经营工商业的人，即有完纳工商业税的义务。货物税与工商业税，系属两税性质，货物税是间接税，课税对象为货物，是转嫁给消费者负担的。工商业税是直接税，课税对象为工商业者，由经营工商业者负担的，所以应分别完纳。
    四、卷烟工业本非有益于国计民生事业，在总的税政方针下，本不予以鼓励，且准备将手工卷烟业者尽可能转到有益于国计民生的生产方面，但为了照顾一时不易转业，故没有严厉取缔，且规定较低的税率，并由各地税务机关及工商业机关，帮助他们慢慢转业（在本年八月二十日工商部与税总曾发联合指示）。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　华北税务总局编者：
    我是一个行销纸烟的小商人，是先从制烟者购买贴足税票的纸烟来零星售卖，不知还要完纳新税的从价百分之六十的税否？请解答！
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　孙庚申孙庚申先生：
    你所购存的纸烟，如系老解放区从量征税已贴足老区税局之税证的，可不必再纳从价百分之六十的税。
