　　In response to the U.S. Imperialist Persecution of American Communist Leaders
  　The People of Beijing Rise Up in Protest
  The fascist behavior of U.S. imperialism has torn off the last piece of "democratic cloth" of the bourgeoisie.
  [Reported by this newspaper] After the news of the U.S. reactionary government's shameless sentencing of eleven American Communist leaders to imprisonment reached the capital, people from all walks of life expressed their anger and protest. All workers and staff of the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory held a general meeting on the 20th, and workers of the Beijing Telephone Bureau No. 2 held a discussion. At the meetings, workers denounced the atrocities of U.S. imperialism, believing that this was not only a shameless attack on the American working class, but also a shameless attack on the working class of the world. They unanimously expressed their firm support for the American working class. The general meeting of all workers of the North China Agricultural Machinery Factory also issued a declaration protesting to the U.S. government and demanding the unconditional release of the American Communist leaders. Workers of the North China Electric Power Branch and the Dahua Dense Industry Factory also expressed their protests. Wang Jimei of the Electric Power Branch also wrote to American Communist Party Chairman Foster to express his condolences and support. Chai Zemin, director of the Beijing Municipal Farmers Association Preparatory Committee, and committee members Su Min and Liu Gang also issued statements expressing their protest. Chai Zemin said: "U.S. imperialism is repeating the path of Mussolini and Hitler. Our 640,000 suburban farmers have experienced that only the Communist Party is the savior of the people and has true democracy." They called on the working people of the world to unite and "overthrow all bloody fascist reactionaries." Song Guofan, Han Chong, Zhang Wei, Xiao Gang and others of the Third District CCP District Committee, after expressing their protest against the reactionary atrocities of U.S. imperialism, said: This action shows the fragility of U.S. imperialism, they have torn off the last piece of "democratic cloth," and this incident is a good education for democratic individualists who harbor illusions about American-style bourgeois "democracy." The Student Union of Beijing Normal University issued a protest letter, which said: "This is the most shameless page in a series of crimes committed by U.S. imperialism to provoke new wars and infringe upon the interests of its own people. ... We solemnly warn the U.S. imperialist fascist bandits: Your shameful "verdict" will never deter the American Communist Party from fighting for the interests of the working people, on the contrary, it will awaken and excite the vast number of American people who love peace and freedom. Your frantic attack on the American working class will surely fail! The fate of Hitler and Chiang Kai-shek awaits you!"

  美帝法西斯的行为，撕掉了资产阶级最后的一块“民主布”。
  【本报讯】美国反动政府无耻地判处十一位美共领袖徒刑的消息传到首都后，各界人民纷纷表示愤怒与抗议。华北农业机械总厂全体工人职员于二十日举行了全体大会，北京电话二局工人举行了座谈会。在会上工人们控诉了美帝暴行，认为这不仅是对美国工人阶级的无耻进攻，也是对全世界工人阶级的无耻进攻。他们一致表示坚决声援美国工人阶级。华北农业机械厂全体工人大会并发出宣言，向美国政府提出抗议，要求无条件释放美共领袖。华北电业分公司和大华密业厂工人也纷纷表示抗议。电业分公司王继美并致书美共主席福斯特表示慰问与声援。北京市农会筹备会主任柴泽民、委员苏民、刘刚亦发表谈话表示抗议。柴泽民说：“美帝正重复着墨索里尼、希特勒的道路。我们郊区六十四万农民体验到，只有共产党才是人民的救星，才有真正的民主。”他们号召全世界劳动人民团结起来，“把一切血腥的法西斯反动派打倒。”三区中共区委会宋国藩、韩冲、张玮、萧刚等在表示抗议美帝反动暴动之后说：这一举动正表示美帝的脆弱，他们已撕去了最后一块“民主布”，这一事件对于对美国式资产阶级“民主”抱幻想的民主个人主义者是一个很好的教育。北京师范大学学生会发表了抗议书，抗议书中说：“这是美帝为进行新战争挑拨及侵犯其本国人民利益的一系列罪行中最无耻的一页。……我们正告美帝法西斯匪徒们：你们这种可耻的“判决”，决吓不退为劳动人民利益奋斗的美国共产党，相反的更将唤醒激动广大爱好和平自由的美国人民。你们疯狂地向美国工人阶级进攻必遭失败！希特勒蒋介石的命运等待着你们！”
