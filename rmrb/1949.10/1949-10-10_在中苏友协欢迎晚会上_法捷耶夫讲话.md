　　At the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Welcome Reception
    Fadeyev's Speech

    Dear friends!
    Soviet literary and art workers extend warm and lofty greetings to the free Chinese people and the new Chinese intellectual community!
    We, the Soviet people, under the education of Lenin and Stalin, have been concerned with every stage of the Chinese revolution with the greatest sympathy since the first day of the Chinese people's revolution. We were concerned about the Chinese revolution even when the great Sun Yat-sen was leading the revolution.
    We shared with you all the unimaginable difficulties in the revolution, rejoiced together for the victory of the revolution, and now we sing together the cause of the people's revolution and the deeds of the people's outstanding heroes. The names of Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people, and the various generals of the People's Liberation Army led by Zhu De are known to everyone in the Soviet Union, even every primary school student.
    We are also very concerned about the Chinese cultural movement.
    A few days ago, we personally participated in the grand ceremony for the establishment of the People's Republic of China and the Central People's Government! We also rejoiced with you on this historically significant day when the Chinese people defeated imperialism and domestic reactionaries. Especially because the great road of Chinese cultural development has been opened up, which will propel China into the ranks of the people with the highest civilization in the world!
    I hope you will quickly and thoroughly eliminate the reactionary forces and strive for a bright future for China.
    Our purpose in coming to China is to further consolidate our friendship and exchange experiences of cultural achievements between our two countries. We will study with the greatest enthusiasm the best things in ancient Chinese culture, and also study the people's culture that is being created in New China. We will do everything possible to make the Soviet people understand Chinese culture, and we will strive to contribute our experience in cultural construction to the great Chinese people!
    Let our indestructible friendship be consolidated! Develop!
    Long live the independent, heroic, and hardworking Chinese people!
    Long live Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people!

　　在中苏友协欢迎晚会上
    法捷耶夫讲话
    亲爱的朋友们！
    苏联文艺工作者向自由的中国人民和中国新的知识界致热烈的崇高的敬礼！
    我们苏联人民在列宁斯大林的教育下，从中国人民革命的第一天开始就抱着最大的同情关心中国革命的每个阶段。还是在伟大的孙中山领导革命的时候，我们就关心中国革命。
    我们和你们一块儿感受过革命中的一切不可想象的困难，一块儿为革命的胜利而欢喜，现在又一块来歌诵人民革命的事业和人民出色的英雄们的事迹。中国人民领袖毛泽东和以朱德为首的人民解放军的各个将领的名字在苏联，是人人知道的，甚至每个小学生也都知道。
    我们也很关心中国的文化运动。
    前几天，我们亲身参加了中华人民共和国和中央人民政府成立的盛大典礼！我们也同你们一起在这中国人民战胜帝国主义和国内反动派的有历史意义的日子里，高兴得了不得。特别因为中国文化发展的伟大道路是打开了，这就会把中国推进到世界最高文明的人民行列去了！
    我希望你们很快地彻底地肃清反动势力，争取中国光明的未来。
    我们来到中国的目的是为了更加巩固我们间的友谊和交换我们两个国家中间的文化方面成功的经验，我们要用最大的热情来研究中国古代文化里面最好的东西，也要研究新中国正在创造中的人民文化，我们要尽一切力量使苏联人民认识中国文化，我们要努力把我们文化建设的经验贡献给伟大的中国人民！
    让我们不可摧毁的友谊巩固起来！发展起来！
    独立的英勇的爱好劳动的中国人民万岁！
    中国人民的领袖毛泽东万岁！
