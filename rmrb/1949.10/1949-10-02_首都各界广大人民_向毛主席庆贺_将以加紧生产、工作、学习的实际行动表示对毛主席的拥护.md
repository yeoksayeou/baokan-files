　　People from All Walks of Life in the Capital
　　Congratulate Chairman Mao
    Expressing Their Support with Practical Actions of Intensified Production, Work, and Study
    [Our Newspaper's Report] The broad masses of people in the capital are closely following the election news of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference with great enthusiasm and concern. On the evening of the 30th, all the radios in the city's government offices and shops were crowded with people. When the news of the election of Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Communist Party of China, as Chairman of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, was broadcast, cheers like a storm immediately erupted throughout the city, unanimously expressing their strong support. The slogan "Long live Chairman Mao!" resounded through the clouds. Workers at the 70th Ordnance Factory said happily: In the past, Chairman Mao led us to defeat Japan and Chiang Kai-shek. In the future, he will lead us to build a new China well. Hu Quanggui, an employee of the tram repair factory, said: "That's great! Our leader has been elected Chairman of the government. We must work harder to produce in the future to show our support and love for Chairman Mao." Xing Weiqing, a worker at the 7th Telephone Bureau, said: "I had this in mind a long time ago! Only with Chairman Mao's leadership can the revolution be completely victorious." Employees of the Beijing Branch of North China Electric Power Company, Dongshui Plant, North China Construction Company, 3rd Telecommunications Bureau, Dahua Pottery Company, Ci Xing Iron Factory, Sanyang Flour Mill, Jingwei Weaving Mill, Li'an Iron Factory, Huaxing Textile and Dyeing Factory, Kaiyuan Carpet Factory, Yanjing Textile and Dyeing Factory and other factories unanimously expressed their infinite confidence and extremely happy mood: Chairman Mao becoming Chairman is the happiness of the 475 million people of China. We must work harder to produce in the future, respond to all of Chairman Mao's calls, and build the people's capital!
    After the news of Chairman Mao's election spread to major universities and middle schools in Beijing, another wave of revelry among teachers and students was set off. All the teachers and students of North China University were immersed in cheers for a long time because of Chairman Mao's election. They unanimously believed that this was completely in line with the wishes of the Chinese people, and expressed that they would express their sincere support for Chairman Mao with more intensive study in the future. The students of Normal University and Fu Jen Catholic University who heard the news first ran around to spread the news and the election results to every corner. The students who were rushing to make lanterns cheered and applauded, and some students who were already asleep also got up. The students were full of confidence and pride and said: With Chairman Mao, any difficulties can be solved. After hearing the news, the teachers and students of the Hui People's Institute shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" After recalling the oppression of the Hui people under the Kuomintang "government" in the past, they said: Thanks to the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao in the Chinese People's Liberation War and the victory they achieved, we have seen the birth of a new China, and we, the Hui people, have stood up from now on. Comrade Wan Yaobin said: "This is the warmth that Chairman Mao has given us. Our ethnic minorities have come to the big family. Our Hui youth will resolutely complete the task of building the Great Northwest and building a new China under the leadership of Chairman Mao in the future." Su Min, a member of the Beijing Agricultural Preparation Committee, said: Wherever Chairman Mao's army goes, the peasants there will be liberated. Chairman Mao's land policy has relieved the suffering of the peasants and enabled the common people to truly stand up. All the peasants in the country will definitely celebrate Chairman Mao's election! After hearing the news of Chairman Mao's election, the cadres of the District Committees of the Third and Twelfth Districts of the city and the labor union office of the First District firmly believed that, under Chairman Mao's leadership, the complete victory of the revolution will be accelerated, and the construction of a new democratic country will be developed more quickly.
