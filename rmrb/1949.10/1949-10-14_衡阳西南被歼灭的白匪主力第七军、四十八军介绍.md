Xinhua News Agency, Central China Front, 13th: "Introduction to the White Bandit Main Force 7th and 48th Armies." The White bandit main force 7th and 48th Armies, completely annihilated by the People's Liberation Army in the Huangshapu area southwest of Hengyang on the Central China Front, were the forces with which the Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi bandit gangs started and the main capital for their political speculation. The 7th Army was established in the spring of 1926, with Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi serving as commander and chief of staff, respectively. Later, Xia Wei and Zhang Gan successively took over as commanders. The 48th Army was originally the 15th Army of Li Pinxian's department under the Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi bandit gangs, renamed the 48th Army in 1933. In the early stage of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the two armies successively left Guangxi and went to the north bank of the Yangtze River, and then turned to the Dabie Mountains to avoid fighting the Japanese invaders. They specialized in attacking the New Fourth Army, which persisted in the War of Resistance Against Japan, and massacred patriotic people. The people of the Dabie Mountains hated them to the bone. In August and September 1946 and November 1947, when the White bandit 7th Army (then known as the Reorganized 7th Division) attacked the Soviet Northern Jiangsu Liberated Area, it was successively annihilated by the People's Liberation Army in the Sixian and Huaiyin areas, suffering heavy blows with four regiments eliminated. Since then, in battles with the People's Liberation Army, the two armies never dared to confront the People's Liberation Army head-on. They always fled first in case of emergency, thus avoiding complete annihilation. This time, under the powerful and rapid offensive of the People's Liberation Army on the Central China Front, the four divisions of the two armies finally could not escape, were surrounded in the Huangshapu area southwest of Hengyang, and were completely wiped out after fierce fighting in the west.

　　衡阳西南被歼灭的白匪主力第七军、四十八军介绍
    【新华社华中前线十三日电】“白匪主力第七军及四十八军介绍”。在华中前线衡阳西南黄山铺地区被人民解放军全部歼灭的白匪主力第七军及四十八军是李宗仁、白崇禧匪帮的起家部队，也是李白匪帮进行政治投机的主要本钱。第七军成立于一九二六年春，由李宗仁、白崇禧分任军长、参谋长，以后由夏威、张淦先后继任军长。四十八军原即李宗仁、白崇禧匪帮李品仙部之十五军，一九三三年改称四十八军。抗日战争初期，该两军相继离桂开到长江北岸，旋即转入大别山，避免与日寇作战，专门袭击坚持抗日战争的新四军，屠杀爱国人民，大别山人民恨之入骨。一九四六年八、九月间及一九四七年十一月白匪第七军（当时称整编第七师）在进攻苏北解放区时，曾先后被人民解放军在泗县、淮阴地区歼灭四个整团，遭受重大打击。此后，该两军在与人民解放军作战中，始终不敢与人民解放军正面交锋，遇情况紧急时总是首先逃跑，因此得免全部被歼。此次在华中前线人民解放军强大迅速的攻势下，该两军四个师终于逃也逃不及，被包围于衡阳西南黄山铺地区，并在西四激战后全部被消灭。
