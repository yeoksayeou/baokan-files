Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 27th: TASS, New York: Vyshinsky, head of the Soviet delegation, has strongly urged the United Nations General Assembly to save the lives of innocent Greek patriots who have been sentenced to death. Vyshinsky stated at a meeting of the First Committee (Political Committee) of the United Nations General Assembly on the 24th:

	The Soviet delegation has learned that the Athens military tribunals are continuing to sentence Greek patriots to death. For example, on October 13th of this year, the Athens military tribunal sentenced eight outstanding figures who participated in the Greek People's Liberation Movement to death. These eight individuals had bravely fought against the Hitlerite aggressors for freedom and the independence of their motherland. They are: Evangelia Salaghis, Dimitrios Mouratidis, Arterio Ioannidis, Sotirios Balbounakis, Georgios Iliopoulos, Iakovos Famiris, Antonios Stratakos, and Ekaterina Taragani (Zifkos).

	The Athens military tribunal has sentenced them to death two or three times. The verdicts are without any basis, without any proof of any crimes they committed, but solely based on the testimony of police, particularly the testimony of Afavanitis, a special agent of the Piraeus Asfalia (the Greek secret political police department in Piraeus), who, according to the government's official statement, committed suicide. The court handed down this inhuman verdict against the above eight Greek patriots in response to the condemned's exposure of the torture regime of the Piraeus Asfalia. Information obtained from the prisons speaks of the torture suffered by the condemned Greek patriots, who are subjected to all possible tortures, including the so-called "franks," which involves hanging a person with their bound hands threaded through their bound feet. Imprisoned Greek patriots are subjected to burning, hair-pulling, and driven to madness and suicide. It is now well known that the Asfalia agent Afavanitis wrote in a letter to his sister (which was read in court): "I cannot bear the screams of the tortured."

	Athens Reactionary Courts Extremely Brutal, Exhausting Torture of Patriotic Elements
	Soviet People Angrily Protest
	The methods by which the Greek authorities force the defendants to "confess" can be seen from the following brutal facts: For example, forcing the arrested to stand under the scorching sun, wind, and rain for hours carrying sandbags, and other inhuman methods. The patriot and outstanding political leader Taksis died as a result of torture, while Evangelia Salaghis, one of the eight who were convicted together, was subjected to "franks" and burning; every form of torture has been tried on this twenty-five-year-old woman. The names of the butchers who torture Greek patriots are known. Notorious for their ferocity are the butchers operating under the names of Janlis, Qihhe, Mosiqiaos, and Qiqiaosi, whose real name is Joachim. He is an expert in tortures such as squeezing and twisting the genitals.

	The millions of working people of the Soviet Union have learned with deep anger of these new crimes of the Greek royalist-fascist regime, and all honest people in the world cannot but angrily voice their protest against the crimes committed by the royalist-fascist government that madly abuses Greek patriots in these days.

	According to the instructions of the Soviet government (the relatives of the condemned have appealed to the Soviet Union to rescue the innocent from the death penalty), the Soviet delegation urges the United Nations General Assembly to speak out in order to save the lives of the innocent Greek patriots who have been condemned. The Soviet delegation proposes the adoption of the following special resolution: "Be it noted that the Greek military tribunals are now continuing to sentence leaders of the People's Liberation Movement to death, and that on October 13th of this year, the Athens military tribunal sentenced eight outstanding public leaders, heroic fighters against the Hitlerite aggressors—Evangelia Salaghis, Dimitrios Mouratidis, Arterio Ioannidis, Sotirios Balbounakis, Georgios Iliopoulos, Iakovos Famiris, Antonios Stratakos, and Ekaterina Taragani (Zifkos)—to death, the First Committee requests the Greek government to cease the execution of the death sentences of the aforementioned persons, and to annul these verdicts."

	Following Vyshinsky's statement, the First Committee proceeded to discuss the Soviet delegation's proposal.

　　维辛斯基敦促联大 
    拯救希腊爱国者　
    制止雅典保皇法西斯罪行
    【新华社北京二十七日电】塔斯社纽约讯：苏联代表团团长维辛斯基力促联合国大会拯救无辜被判死刑的希腊爱国者的生命。维辛斯基于二十四日在联合国大会第一委员会（政治委员会）的会议上发表声明称：
    苏联代表团获悉，雅典军事法庭仍在继续对希腊爱国者判处死刑。例如本年十月十三日，雅典军事法庭把八个参加希腊人民解放运动的卓越人物判处了死刑。这八个人曾为自由和祖国的独立对希特勒侵略者英勇作战。他们是：埃凡吉利亚·萨拉吉斯，迪米特里奥·穆拉梯迪斯，阿尔特里奥·约安尼狄斯，索梯里奥斯·巴尔布纳基斯，乔治奥斯·伊利奥波洛斯，雅可沃斯·发米里斯，安托尼奥斯·斯特拉科斯，耶卡特里纳·塔拉甘尼（齐夫哥斯）。
    雅典军事法庭两番三次地把他们判处死刑。判决没有任何理由，没有关于他们犯过任何罪名的任何证明，而仅是根据警察特别是比利犹斯阿斯法里亚（在比利犹斯的希腊秘密政治警察部）特务阿法万尼蒂斯的口证，而他，按照政府的官方说法，自杀了。法庭对上述八个希腊爱国者作非人性的判决，以答复被定罪者对于比利犹斯阿斯法里亚的酷刑统治的揭露。自监狱那里获得的消息，谈到被定罪的希腊爱国者所受的酷刑，他们受到一切可能的酷刑，包括所谓“法兰克斯”，就是把人被绑的手穿过被绑的脚吊起。被监禁的希腊爱国者，受到火刑、拔头发，被逼得发疯和自杀。现在人所共知，即阿斯法里亚特务阿法万尼蒂斯在给他姐姐的信（这信曾在法庭宣读）中曾写道：“我受不了受酷刑者的喊叫”。
    雅典反动法庭暴虐已极用尽酷刑折磨爱国分子
    苏联人民愤怒抗议
    希腊当局用什么办法逼使被告“认罪”，可以从下面这些暴虐事实看出来：例如强逼被捕者负着沙袋几小时地站在烈日、风雨之下以及其他非人性的办法。爱国者和卓越的政治领袖塔克西斯，由于受到酷刑而身死，而上述八个一起被定罪者中的埃凡吉利亚·萨拉吉斯，则受到“法兰克斯”和火刑，在这个二十五岁的女郎的身上，一切酷刑都曾试过。折磨希腊爱国者的屠夫的名字是人们知道的。因其穷凶极恶而出名的是以詹利斯、启赫、莫斯启奥斯、启吉奥斯启名字活动的屠夫，他的真名字是约启姆。他在压榨扭曲生殖器官等苦刑方面是专家。
    苏联的千百万劳动人民怀着深深的愤怒获悉希腊保皇法西斯政权的这些新罪行，世界上所有诚实的人民不得不愤怒地声言，抗议那些发狂地虐待希腊爱国者的保皇法西斯政府在这些日子所犯的罪行。
    按照苏联政府的训令（被定罪者的亲属曾呼吁苏联从死刑中援救无辜者），苏联代表团促请联合国大会发言，以便援救无辜而被定罪的希腊爱国者的生命。苏联代表团提议通过下列特别决议：“兹促请注意这一事实：即现在希腊军事法庭继续对人民解放运动领袖判处死刑，且本年十月十三日，雅典军事法庭判处八名卓越的公众领袖、反对希特勒侵略者的英勇的斗士——埃凡吉利亚·萨拉吉斯，迪米特里奥·穆拉梯迪斯，阿尔特里奥·约安尼狄斯，索梯里奥斯·巴尔布纳基斯，乔治奥斯·伊利奥波洛斯，雅可沃斯·发米里斯，安托尼奥斯·斯特拉科斯和耶卡特里纳·塔拉甘尼（齐夫哥斯）以死刑，第一委员会要求希腊政府停止执行上述数人的死刑，并取消这些判决。”
    在维辛斯基声明之后，第一委员会进行讨论苏联代表团的提议。
