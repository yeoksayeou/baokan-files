　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 26th: TASS, The Hague, 24th: The Central Committee of the Dutch Communist Party, regarding the shameless action of the American reactionary court in sentencing eleven leaders of the American Communist Party to imprisonment and fines, sent a telegram to the American Communist leaders, expressing warm support for their heroic struggle. The telegram also stated: "We believe that this sentence by the American reactionaries is an act of war against all freedom-loving and democratic humanity."
　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 26th: TASS, Brussels, 24th: The Belgian newspaper Red Flag stated: The trial of the leaders of the American Communist Party is an ugly incident of "American-style democracy," and pointed out that the "justice" of American trusts treats the Communist Party with Hitler's methods. Red Flag emphasized that the best sons of the American people have dedicated their entire lives to the cause of the working people and their welfare, freedom, and peace, while the American monopolists have imprisoned them. The leaders of the American Communist Party were "convicted" simply because they had voiced opposition to the instigators of a new war.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 26th: TASS, New York, 24th: The Worker's Daily criticized the American bourgeois newspapers and radio stations for adopting a lying offensive out of fear, attempting to conceal the truth of the insane frame-up "trial" of the American Communist leaders from the American public. The Worker's Daily continued: The accusations and "trial" against the American Communist leaders are all fabricated conspiracies. But: "It is impossible to suppress the philosophies of peace, freedom, and socialism through laws without suppressing the entire tradition, constitution, and Bill of Rights."
　　The American Civil Rights Congress issued a statement stating: Medina's refusal to grant bail to the American Communist leaders actually prevents the Communist Party from having the opportunity to bring his case to public opinion and inform the American people of the truth of the "trial". The American reactionaries are afraid of what would happen if the American people heard about the discrimination against blacks and workers by the jury and the judge, heard about the open prejudice, and heard about jurors who admitted to being prejudiced but remained on the jury.

　　荷共中央声援美共领袖　
    美工人日报斥反动派掩盖“审讯”真相
    【新华社北京二十六日电】塔斯社二十四日海牙讯：荷兰共产党中央委员会为美国反动法庭判处十一位美共领袖徒刑及罚金的无耻行动，特致电美共领袖，表示热忱支援他们的英勇斗争，该电并称：“我们认为美国反动派的这种宣判，是反对全世界自由民主人类的战争行动。”
    【新华社北京二十六日电】塔斯社布鲁塞尔二十四日讯：比利时的红旗报称：美国共产党领袖们的受审讯，乃是“美国式民主”的丑事，并指出美国托辣斯的“司法”，以希特勒的手段来对待共产党。红旗报强调指出，美国人民最优秀的儿子把他们的全部生命贡献于劳动人民和他们的福利、自由及和平的事业，而美国的独占资本家却把他们关进监狱。美国共产党领袖们之所以被“判罪”，仅是因为他们曾发出反对新战争挑拨者的呼声。
    【新华社北京二十六日电】塔斯社纽约二十四日讯：工人日报斥责美国资产阶级的报纸和电台因恐惧而采用撒谎攻势，试图在美国公众的面前，掩盖疯狂陷害美共领袖的“审讯”真相。工人日报继称：对于美共领袖的控告和“审讯”全是诬陷的阴谋。但是：“用法令取缔和平、自由和社会主义的哲学思想，就不可能不取缔整个传统、宪法和权利法案。”
    美国民权保障大会发表声明称：麦迪纳拒绝美共领袖保释的行为，实际上就是阻止美共有机会把他的案件诉诸舆论，并把“审讯”的真相告知美国人民。美国反动派害怕着：如果美国人民听到陪审团和法官对黑人和工人歧视的情况，听到关于公开的偏见和自认心怀偏见而仍留在陪审团中的陪审员出庭的情况，会发生怎样的后果。
