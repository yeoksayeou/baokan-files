　　Lu Xun's Illness Suspected to Have Been Delayed by Doctor Suto
　　Zhou Jianren
　　Before Lu Xun fell ill, he often went to Uchiyama Bookstore to buy books, thus becoming acquainted with an old Japanese doctor named Suto. He was very quiet and humble. He knew a little about Chinese history and had read books such as the "Compendium of Materia Medica" (in Japanese translation). After getting to know him, Lu Xun himself, and sometimes others he introduced, would ask Suto to take a look when they had minor ailments. Suto was quite serious when seeing patients and his fees were low. When Lu Xun's lung disease recurred, he also asked him to take a look. Suto said that it was indeed lung disease, but at his (Lu Xun's) age, he would definitely not die from lung disease.
　　According to Lu Xun, Suto was originally a Japanese military doctor. He had contributed during the Russo-Japanese War. Because he treated wounded soldiers day and night, using X-rays to find the location of bullets, his own reproductive glands were damaged, so he never had children. Because he was old and retired, he now worked as a doctor on his own.
　　I also heard from other sources that there was a Japanese veterans' association (i.e., retired soldiers) in Shanghai, which was an aggressive group, and Suto served as its vice president. I also knew that the telephone calls at Suto's house were mostly not about medical matters, but mostly about Sino-Japanese negotiations and conflicts.
　　I then advised Lu Xun not to consult Doctor Suto anymore. But it was to no avail.
　　Lu Xun's illness gradually became serious. But after a period of time, he seemed to get better again. However, suddenly a rapid attack of asthma occurred, and he died quickly. According to Suto, it was because of a perforation of pulmonary tuberculosis, air leakage, and pressure on the heart, which caused asthma. There was no cure, so he died.
　　After Lu Xun passed away, I immediately received a letter from Jiaotong University, from Luo □□ (name forgotten). He suspected that Lu Xun was murdered by a Japanese doctor. And he asked me to keep his secret (not to publicize his speculation) if I found no evidence. After reading it, I burned his letter.
　　But at least one thing is suspicious (there is no evidence in other aspects, so I can't say anything): I suspect that Lu Xun's illness was delayed by Doctor Suto. When Lu Xun was seriously ill, he also saw a specialist in lung diseases. According to that doctor, the disease was already serious, but it could still be treated. The first step was to urgently drain the fluid from the pleura. If delayed, it would be incurable. When asked about Doctor Suto, he replied that there was no fluid in the pleura. After about a month, Suto said that there was indeed fluid and only then did he begin to drain the fluid.
　　Also, after Lu Xun's death, the funeral committee asked Suto to write a report on the treatment process. However, what was said in the report did not quite match the actual treatment. It seemed that the section on draining pleural fluid was moved forward to an earlier period.
　　So at least it can be said that Lu Xun's illness was suspected to have been delayed by Doctor Suto. - Some time ago, when I inquired about Doctor Suto's situation in Shanghai, he had long since disappeared. He may have been withdrawn with the Japanese troops and could not be investigated.
　　I haven't mentioned Mr. Luo □□'s conjecture for thirteen years. I mention it today to show his good intentions in caring about Lu Xun.

　　鲁迅的病疑被须藤医生所耽误
    周建人
    鲁迅病前常到内山书店里去买书，因此认识了一个日本老医生，姓须藤。很沉静而谦和。知道点中国历史，读过本草纲目（有日本译本）等书。认识后，鲁迅自己，有时也介绍别人，有小毛病时叫须藤去看看。须藤看病也还认真，取费也低廉。鲁迅肺病复发时，也就叫他去看了。须藤说，的确是肺病，但象他（鲁迅）的年纪，决不会死于肺病。
    据鲁迅说，须藤本为日本军医官。在日俄战争时曾出过力。因昼夜医治伤兵，用Ｘ光线找寻弹子所在，结果，自己的生殖腺受了损伤，所以一生不曾生过孩子。因年老退休，现在自己做做医生。
    我又从别处听来：上海有一个日本在乡军人（即退伍军人）的会，是一个侵略性的团体，须藤担任副会长。又知道须藤家的电话里所讲的多般不是医药上的事情，却多数是中日之间的交涉与冲突。
    我遂去劝鲁迅不要再请教须藤医生。但结果无效。
    鲁迅的病渐渐沉重起来。但过了一个时期，又好象好起来了。可是忽然急剧的气喘发作，很快的就死去了。据须藤说：因肺结核穿孔，空气外漏，心脏受压迫，所以气喘。无法可治，所以死了。
    鲁迅去世后，我即收到一封交通大学寄来的信，具罗□□（名字已忘记）。他猜疑鲁迅系被日本医生所谋害。并要求我如查无实据，给他保守秘密（不要宣传他的这种推测）。我看后，便把他的信烧掉了。
    但至少有一点是可疑的（别方面没有证据，不能说什么）：疑鲁迅的病被须藤医生所耽误。鲁迅病重时，也曾经看过肺病专门医生，据那医生说：病已严重，但还可医治，第一步须急把肋膜的积水抽去，如果迟延，必不治。问须藤医生时，回答是说：肋膜里并无积水。过了约莫一个月的时间，须藤又说确有积水，才开始抽积水。
    又，鲁迅死后，治丧委员会要须藤写治疗经过的报告。可是报告里所说，与实际治疗不大相符合。好象抽肋膜积水一节移前了一个时期。
    所以至少可以说鲁迅的病疑被须藤医生所耽误。——前一些时，向上海去打听须藤医生的情形时，早已不知去向，可能早随日本兵队撤走无法查考了。
    十三年来没有提起过罗□□先生的猜度，今天提一下，以表明他关心鲁迅的好意。
