Xinhua News Agency, Northwest Front, 12th. A unit of the People's Liberation Army's First Field Army held a grand ceremony for entering Xinjiang on the 5th of this month at a certain location on the front lines. Peng Dehuai, Commander of the First Field Army, Gan Siqi, Director of the Political Department, and Wang Zhen, Commander of the First Army Corps, all attended and spoke. Commander Peng gave a brief introduction to Xinjiang and elaborated on its importance in national defense. In his speech, Director Gan praised the unit's fighting spirit in crossing snow-capped mountains and grasslands and advancing bravely, and extended warm greetings. He then pointed out that among Xinjiang's four million people, who consist of many ethnic groups, the Uyghur compatriots account for three-quarters. Due to the past rule of the Kuomintang reactionary government's Han chauvinism, discord was created between the Han and Uyghur people. This time, we must bring the fine tradition of respecting the customs and habits of all ethnic groups to Xinjiang, unite all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, and build a new Xinjiang. General Wang Zhen called on all commanders and fighters not to relax their fighting will, to be more vigilant, overcome difficulties, enter Xinjiang, and reorganize the uprising troops. All the commanders and fighters of the unit forgot the difficulties and hardships of crossing the snow-capped mountains and grasslands a few days ago and were excited and happy to accept this new glorious mission. Li Deying, a veteran of the Long March, recalled the scene of developing Nanniwan in northern Shaanxi in 1943, saying, "We, the 359th Brigade, turned a barren area like Nanniwan into 'the Jiangnan of northern Shaanxi'; Xinjiang is so large and so rich, as long as everyone rises up to build it, it will surely become a prosperous area in three to five years." All units are making every effort to prepare everything for entering Xinjiang. The Political Department published "Investigation of Xinjiang" for cadres at all levels to read and reference, and rushed to print the Chinese People's Liberation Army Proclamation in Uyghur and a Chinese translation of Uyghur conversation. The logistics department is making every effort to purchase fur and leather, manufacturing large quantities of leather clothing, leather hats, leather gloves, and felt boots, and baking large quantities of beef jerky rations. Doctors are immersed in studying methods for preventing diseases that may occur in Northwest winters and preparing various medicines. More than 180 sewing machines in the clothing factory under the former Joint Logistics Headquarters, which had been taken over in Zhangye City, were running day and night to make winter clothing for the advancing army. Workers in the felt boot section of the clothing factory were rushing to repair workshops and make felt boots. The soldiers are actively practicing and studying methods to overcome all the difficulties in the snow and extremely cold desert areas. All military and commercial vehicles near the garrison have been concentrated at designated locations, awaiting departure.

　　第一野战军某部
    举行进驻新疆典礼
    彭德怀甘泗淇王震均亲临讲话号召团结各族人民建设新新疆
    【新华社西北前线十二日电】本月五日，人民解放军第一野战军一部，于前线某地举行进驻新疆的隆重典礼。第一野战军彭德怀司令员、政治部甘泗淇主任及一兵团王震司令员均亲临讲话。彭司令员对新疆作一简单的介绍，并阐述其在国防上的重要性。甘主任在讲话中，赞扬该部翻越雪山草地，奋勇进军的战斗精神，并致热烈的慰问。接着指出民族众多的新疆四百万人口中，维吾尔族同胞占四分之三。由于过去国民党反动政府的大汉族主义的统治，造成了维汉之间的不合。此次进军，我们要把尊重各民族风俗习惯的优良作风，带到新疆去，团结新疆各民族，建设新的新疆。王震将军号召全体指战员，毫不松懈战斗意志，更加提高警惕，克服困难，进驻新疆，改编起义部队。该部全体指战员，都忘记了日前翻越雪山草地的艰难困苦，为接受此一新的光荣任务而兴奋喜悦。长征老战士李德英，回忆到一九四三年开发陕北南泥湾的情景说：“南泥湾那样的荒草地区，我们三五九旅竟把它开关成‘陕北江南’；新疆那么大，又那么富，只要大家起来建设，管保三五年后就变成富饶地区。”各部各单位均以大力筹备进驻新疆的一切准备工作。政治部出版“新疆调查”，供各级干部阅读参考，并赶印维吾尔文的中国人民解放军布告及维语会话汉译本。后勤部门以全力收购皮毛，大批制造皮衣、皮帽、皮手套及毡靴，并大量烤制牛肉干粮。医生们埋头研究西北冬季可能发生的疾病的预防法及筹备各种药品。张掖城内被接管的伪联勤总部所辖被服厂一百八十余部缝纫机，夜以继日地转动，为进驻大军赶制冬装。被服工厂毡靴部的工人，在抢修工房赶造毡靴。战士们则积极操演，研究克服雪地和沙漠奇寒地带一切困难的方法。驻地附近所有的军用汽车、商用汽车已纷纷集中指定地点，待命出发。
