　　Introduction to the Telecommunications Bureau Choir
    Maple
    In the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau, there is an entertainment organization called the Choir, composed of over three hundred progressive young employees. It has been around for more than two years since its establishment.
    Two years ago, under the rule of the Kuomintang bandit gang, telecommunications bureau employees were silently enslaved day and night. At that time, some progressive young employees were unwilling to endure such inhumane lives in darkness and wanted to find some spiritual entertainment. Based on everyone's needs, the first entertainment organization for the Telecommunications Bureau employees, the Choir, was established on October 8, 1947. At that time, there were two rehearsals every week, and the songs sung were mostly folk songs from the border regions. In an environment where everything was not free, we could only sing these songs, which allowed us to understand the lives of people in the border regions. Sometimes, we also sang some more progressive songs under the radar (at that time, all the songs sung needed to be reviewed by the authorities). In addition to singing, we also learned some music theory.
    In order to promote the rapid progress of the Choir, the organization was strengthened in April 1948, and a large number of members were absorbed. The Choir's constitution was drafted and passed, and executive members were elected through democratic universal suffrage. At this time, some progressive dances, poetry recitations, and living newspapers were introduced to the members. Moreover, the members often went to Peking University and Normal University to learn dancing and recitation, from where they absorbed new culture and new theories, greatly improving the members in all aspects.
    Because of the Choir's activity and progress, the reactionary rulers tried to spread rumors and sabotage it, saying that "the Choir is a mixed bag of men and women," "the Choir is a matchmaking agency," and "the Choir has complex elements," in an attempt to disband the organization.
    Under the rumors and threats of the reactionaries, the Choir not only did not yield but became more active. They organized reading groups, book circulation groups, and mutual aid societies, and often visited various units to teach singing and dancing. During the anti-hunger struggle on October 27, 1948, the Choir members returned to their respective units to organize and lead the struggle, gloriously completing the task of persevering in the struggle. As a result, the reactionary rulers used despicable means to force some members not to go to the Choir and eventually wanted to disband the Choir. After receiving this news, in order to avoid greater harm, the Choir announced a three-month winter break. The slogan at the last evening party read: "Next spring, we will be able to sing freely and happily." In this way, everyone separated, but their hands were tightly clasped, waiting for the arrival of spring.
    This spring, after liberation, the members automatically participated in various propaganda activities, singing, writing slogans, printing leaflets, and performing the Yangge dance. Half a month later, the Choir was restored. After the Choir was restored, it constantly performed to entertain the employees, broadcast on the radio, and participated in the performances of the National Congress of Literary and Art Workers. Recently, it is also preparing to strive for performances at the Asian-Australian Trade Union Representative Conference.
    In the future, we must continue our glorious history, overcome difficulties, and spread our singing to every team, arousing everyone's enthusiasm for production and regular recreational activities. We want to make this organization the center of recreational activities for every employee of the Telecommunications Bureau.

　　电信局歌咏团介绍
    枫
    在北京电信局中，有一个拥有三百余进步青年职工的文娱组织——歌咏团。她自成立到现在，已有两年多的历史了。
    两年前，在国民党匪帮统治下的电信局，职工们整日整夜不声不响的被奴役着，这时有些进步青年职工，不愿长久的过着这暗无天日的非人生活，想找些精神上的娱乐。就根据大家的需要，在一九四七年十月八日成立了电信局第一个职工自己的娱乐组织——歌咏团。那时每周都有两次练习，唱的歌多半是些边疆民谣。在一切都不自由的环境下也只能唱这些歌，从这些歌中使我们了解了边疆人民的生活，有时也在检查漏网下（当时所唱的歌曲均需经当局审查）唱些较进步的歌曲。除唱歌外还学些乐理。
    为了使歌咏团更快的进步，一九四八年四月加强组织，大量的吸收了团员，订出并通过了团章，用民主普选产生了干事。此时并介绍给团员们一些进步的舞蹈、诗歌朗诵、活报剧等。又因团员们常去北大、师大学舞蹈，学朗诵，从那里接受了一些新的文化，新的理论，使团员们在各方面都大大地提高了一步。
    因为歌咏团的活跃和进步，反动统治者们便设法造谣破坏，说什么“歌咏团男女混杂不清”、“歌咏团是婚姻介绍所”、“歌咏团分子复杂”等，企图拆散这个组织。
    歌咏团在反动派的造谣威胁下不仅没有屈服，反而更积极起来了。他们组织了读书会、图书流通小组和互助会，并经常到各单位去访问，教歌教舞。在一九四八年十月二十七日的饿工斗争中，歌咏团员们回到本单位去组织领导斗争，光荣的完成了坚持斗争的任务。于是反动统治者便使用卑鄙的手段，强迫着一些团员不许到歌咏团去，最后便要解散歌咏团。歌咏团得到这消息后，为了避免更大的损害，就宣布冬休三个月。在最后一次晚会的标语上写着：“明年春天，我们就能自由欢乐地歌唱了。”就这样，大家分开了，但他们的手却紧紧的拉着，等待着春天的到来。
    今年春天解放以后，团员们即自动参加各种宣传工作，唱歌、写标语、印传单、扭秧歌。半个月后即恢复了歌咏团。歌咏团恢复以后，不断的演出招待职工，到电台去广播，并参加了全国文代会的演出。最近并准备争取出席亚澳职工代表大会的演出。
    今后我们要继续我们的光荣历史，克服困难，将我们的歌声传到每一小组中去，唤起大家的生产热潮和正规的文娱活动。使这个组织成为电信局每个职工文娱活动的中心。
