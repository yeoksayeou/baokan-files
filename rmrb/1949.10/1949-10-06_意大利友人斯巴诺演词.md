Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 5th. Italian Senator Spano delivered a speech at the founding meeting of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, the full text of which is as follows:

Dear comrades:

Although I am not here as a formal representative, I believe that I actually represent not only the working people of Italy, but all the people of Italy, and also the people in countries around the world that are still under the capitalist system. These people all believe that the friendship between China and the Soviet Union is a great victory for progressive humanity.

Chinese comrades! You are very clear about the significance of the Soviet Union to us who are still under the capitalist system. Because you have only recently emerged from a situation similar to ours. For us, the Soviet Union is the thought of Lenin and Stalin; in the darkest and most difficult moments, as long as we look at the actions of the Soviet Union and see them correctly, we can find the right path in all the wrong roads. The Soviet Union is the realization of the genius of Lenin and Stalin; therefore, the Soviet Union is not only hope and light, but also a clear guarantee of this hope and light. Because today, the Soviet Union is our future. The Soviet Union is peace, is freedom, is culture, is a love for life, because the Soviet Union teaches all free people: there is every reason to love life.

Soviet comrades! You know the significance of the new China to us. The new China is the awakening of a quarter of humanity; the new China is the clarion call of dawn for all nations oppressed by imperialism; the new China is the dying scene of imperialism.

Chinese and Soviet comrades! The friendship between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union has been more solemnly affirmed three days ago because the Soviet Union officially recognized the People's Republic of China. Now let me express in one sentence the significance of the friendship between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union for us: Your friendship is the most sublime and effective expression of the unity of the people of all countries; your friendship is the ideal of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, is the internationalist ideal that has become a great and invincible political reality; your friendship is the guarantee of our future and tomorrow - this tomorrow is about to come, is coming soon, because you are here, because you are united, and united in friendship.

Comrades, long live the eternal friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China! Long live! Long live! Long live!

Long live the People's Republic of China, the inexhaustible source of enthusiasm and confidence for the working people of the world!

Long live the great Soviet Union, the heart and mind of the world!

Salute to Comrade Mao Zedong, the standard-bearer of all nations oppressed by imperialism. Long live!

Salute to Comrade Stalin, our universal teacher, the most affectionate and beloved of us all. Long live! Long live! Long live!

　　意大利友人斯巴诺演词
    【新华社北京五日电】意大利参议员斯巴诺在中苏友好协会成立大会上发表演说，全文如下：亲爱的同志们：
    我在此虽不是正式的代表，但我相信我实际上不仅代表意大利的劳动人民，全意大利的人民，而且还代表全世界还在资本主义制度下的国家中的人民，这些人民都认为中苏两大国的友好，是进步人类的伟大胜利。
    中国的同志们！你们很明了苏联对于还在资本主义制度下的我们的意义。因为你们才从和我们类似的情况脱离不久。对于我们来说，苏联就是列宁、斯大林的思想；在最黑暗和最困难的时刻，我们只要看着苏联的作事，看得对，我们就能在一切错误的道路中找到正确的道路。苏联就是列宁和斯大林天才的实现；因此苏联就不仅是希望和光明，而更是这个希望和光明的明确的保证。因为在今天，苏联就是我们的将来。苏联就是和平，就是自由，就是文化，就是对生活的热爱，因为苏联教给一切自由的人们：有一切理由要热爱生活。
    苏联的同志们！你们知道新中国对于我们的意义。新中国就是四分之一人类的觉醒；新中国就是受帝国主义压迫的一切民族黎明的号角；新中国就是帝国主义死亡的一幕。
    中国和苏联的同志们！中苏两大国家的友好，在三天前因为苏联正式承认中华人民共和国而更加庄严地确定了。现在让我用一句话来表达中苏两大国家友好对于我们的意义：你们的友好是一切国家人民团结最崇高有效的表现；你们的友好，是马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的理想，是已经变成了伟大的、不可战胜的政治现实的国际主义理想；你们的友好，就是我们的将来和明天的保证——这明天，已经要来到，很快来到，因为有你们在，因为你们是团结的，友好团结的。
    同志们，苏联和中华人民共和国永久友好合作万岁！万岁！万岁！
    全世界劳动人民热情和信心不尽的泉源中华人民共和国万岁！
    全世界的心脏和头脑，伟大的苏联万岁！
    向受帝国主义压迫的所有民族的旗手毛泽东同志致敬。万岁！
    向我们全体的导师，我们全体最亲切、热爱的斯大林同志致敬。万岁！万岁！万岁！
