    The Birth of the People's Republic of China is Warmly Celebrated by People All Over the World

    The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, which marks a new era in Chinese history—the era of people's democracy—opened in Beijing on the 21st. This conference is to announce the birth of the people's new China and is the founding ceremony of the People's Republic of China. This ongoing conference is convened on the basis of the decisive victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War and the great unity of the people across the country. It is also convened at a time when the strength of the world peace and democracy camp, led by the Soviet Union, far exceeds that of the imperialist aggression camp, and the movement for peace around the world is surging higher. With the encouragement of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, as well as the progressive people of all countries, the Chinese people have defeated imperialism and its running dogs, the Chinese reactionaries. Today, their victory further strengthens the world peace and democracy camp, especially the confidence of the oppressed nations of the East in their struggle for liberation. Therefore, the victory of the Chinese revolution and the convening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on this basis have great international significance, and the progressive people of the world warmly celebrate it. The British Communist Party, the Czechoslovak Communist Party, the Finnish Communist Party, the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress, the International Democratic Women's Federation, and others have sent telegrams to the Chinese people to celebrate the birth of the new China. Moscow newspapers have published reports on the conference and the full text of Chairman Mao's opening speech. Progressive newspapers in Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary, Britain, France, Denmark, and other countries have also published the news of the founding of the People's Republic of China in prominent positions, with commentaries. The Warsaw People's Forum editorial stated that another gap has been opened in the capitalist and imperialist front. The Warsaw newspaper pointed out that the Chinese people are no longer the object of exploitation by foreign capital. The victory of the Chinese people is the greatest event of this century after the October Revolution in the Soviet Union and the elimination of Hitler's fascism. The London Daily Worker editorial pointed out that the establishment of the new People's Republic of China proves that the U.S. dollar is not omnipotent. The newspaper demanded recognition of the People's Republic of China. The Berlin Soviet Zone Radio stated that the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has attracted great attention from international political circles. Overseas Chinese are even more jubilant, warmly celebrating the rebirth of their motherland.
    　　　　
    The Disgraceful End of U.S. Imperialist Spies: Hungarian Traitors Executed
    After the Hungarian treason case opened in Budapest on the 16th, following the individual interrogation of the defendants and the questioning of witnesses, the debate concluded on the 20th. On the 21st, the prosecutor-general summarized the interrogation, and the eight defendants had no choice but to plead guilty in the face of overwhelming evidence. The People's Court then pronounced judgment on the 24th, sentencing the main culprits, Rajk and two others, to death. Malfer and two others were handed over to the military court, and the remaining two were sentenced to life imprisonment and nine years of imprisonment, respectively. In summarizing the interrogation, the prosecutor-general cited evidence and the testimonies of the defendants and witnesses, proving that the eight criminals were spies of imperialism. They conspired to stage an armed coup, abolish people's democracy, abolish nationalization, cancel land reform, create a restoration of the rule of landlords and capitalists in Hungary, and sell national independence and state sovereignty to the Tito gang and U.S. imperialism. Their crimes were heinous, and they deserved to die. The defendants pleaded guilty not because of remorse, but simply because they could not deny the irrefutable facts. The summary of the interrogation specifically pointed out that the trial in Budapest was not only a trial of Rajk and the other eight, but also a trial of U.S. imperialism and its main accomplice, the Tito gang, for their insidious crimes of espionage and sabotage in the people's democratic countries. The trial revealed that Tito had colluded with imperialism long ago. The Pravda editorial on the 21st explained that after the imperialists' attempt to rely on right-wing political parties in the people's democratic countries failed, they pinned their hopes on conspiracies such as espionage, betrayal, assassination, and intervention. In this, the fascist Tito group played a major role. The trial in Budapest showed that any espionage activity serving imperialism cannot save itself from destruction.
    　　　　
    International Day of Struggle for Peace Approaching: People of All Countries Prepare for Large-Scale Demonstrations
    People of all countries continue to intensify preparations for the "International Day of Struggle for Peace" on October 2nd. This week, the World Federation of Trade Unions issued a call, urging trade unions in all countries to take action on this day to demonstrate their will to uphold international peace and unity and the interconnectedness of the working people of the world, and to redouble their efforts to ensure that the peace movement on this day has the greatest mass character. The Polish Trade Union Federation decided to organize parades and demonstrations in various places from September 27th to October 1st, and to hold mass rallies in Warsaw and other major cities on the 2nd. Peace committees in Britain, Germany, Italy, Israel and other countries have also issued calls, calling for the convening of conferences at that time to oppose the North Atlantic Treaty, oppose the establishment of a divided "state" in West Germany, and oppose plunging humanity into the abyss of a new war. Peace voting is still widely underway in France. The working people in major mining areas and industrial cities such as Montceau-les-Mines and Lyon conducted voting despite police obstruction. Various people's organizations throughout France have announced that they will participate in the demonstrations on the International Day of Struggle for Peace. The Chinese people are also actively preparing for the activities of the "International Day of Struggle for Peace." At that time, rallies and demonstrations will be held in major cities across the country, and the Chinese branch of the World Peace Congress will be officially established in Beijing. The Chinese people's demonstration on the "International Day of Struggle for Peace" will be integrated with the celebration of the birth of the People's Republic of China into a vigorous mass movement.
    The struggle between peace and war is also taking place at the United Nations General Assembly at Flushing Meadows, New York. The Fourth General Assembly opened on the 20th. Under the manipulation and activities of the U.S. representative, Romulo, the Philippine representative who echoes the United States, was elected as the chairman of the General Assembly. At the same time, after the General Assembly elected representatives from the Soviet Union and other countries as vice-chairmen and chairmen of the six committees, it began general speeches on the 21st. Like the previous sessions, the Soviet delegation is still the center of attention. Soviet Chief Representative Vyshinsky delivered a speech at the General Assembly on the 23rd, detailing the facts that the North Atlantic Treaty and the Marshall Plan created by the United States undermined the UN Charter, and made a clear comparison between the construction achievements of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries and their policy of upholding peace and international security, and the war preparation policies of the United States and Britain. Vyshinsky put forward three concrete proposals from the Soviet government at the meeting, namely, the General Assembly should condemn the United States, Britain and other countries for preparing for a new war, unconditionally prohibit and strictly control atomic weapons, and urge all countries to resolve disputes peacefully, and the five permanent members of the Security Council should assume primary responsibility and conclude peace treaties.
    　　　　
    Soviet Union's Peace Proposals to the UN Win Warm Support from People of All Countries
    In his speech, Vyshinsky also denounced Chiang Tingfu, the gangster from Guangzhou, for slandering the Soviet Union on the orders of his American master. He pointed out that Chiang Tingfu's fabrication of history is only enough to prove the bestial hatred of the Chinese reactionary group he represents for all progressive and democratic things. Only the Soviet Union abolished all treaties that violated Chinese sovereignty during the Tsarist era as early as twenty-five years ago, and signed an agreement with China on the basic principles for resolving problems between the two countries. This is the only equal treaty in which a great power respects China's independence. Vyshinsky's speech and proposals were approved and supported by peace-loving countries and people around the world. Chinese progressive newspapers published Vyshinsky's speech in prominent positions.
    While the General Assembly was in progress, Truman announced on the 23rd that an atomic explosion had recently occurred in the Soviet Union, and the bourgeois newspapers of the United States, Britain, Canada and other countries then clamored and spread alarming remarks. On the 24th, TASS issued a statement saying that the Soviet Union is using the latest technology for explosions in large-scale construction work. The Soviet Union had mastered the secrets of atomic weapons as early as 1947, but the Soviet Union "adheres to and will continue to adhere to the position of unconditionally prohibiting atomic weapons." It is not difficult to see that Truman's deliberately sensational announcement was intended to divert world public opinion, while also creating an excuse for the U.S. imperialist conspiracy to intensify the arms race. But the fact that the Soviet Union has long mastered atomic energy shows that the Soviet Union has surpassed the United States in overall national strength, including science and technology, and can therefore more confidently defend lasting world peace together with peace-loving countries and people around the world.
    　　　　
    U.S. Communist Party Warmly Celebrates Party's Birthday: Four Million British Workers Demand Wage Increases
    The Communist Party of the United States commemorates the 30th anniversary of its founding in a determined struggle against the growth of American fascism, the destruction of workers' rights and people's rights by the Wall Street Group, and for peace and democracy. The commemoration held in Madison Square, New York, was attended by 20,000 people. USCP General Secretary Dennis said: "We will block the road of imperialism, fascism and the war camp. To those who want to declare our party illegal, we say 'this road is blocked'." This righteous call of the American working class is sympathized and supported by the working people of the world and all peace-loving and democratic people. Chairman Mao of the Central Committee of the CPC emphasized in his congratulatory telegram to Foster and Dennis that the future of the United States does not belong to the American reactionary forces who are strong on the outside but weak on the inside, but to you and the American people. The Beijing People's Daily published a commentary on the 19th congratulating the 30th anniversary of the U.S. Communist Party, saying, "We Chinese Communists and the Chinese people will work tirelessly with the U.S. Communist Party and the American people to jointly strangle the bloody hands of war mongers on both sides of the Pacific."
    After the pound sterling, the symbol of the British Empire, was devalued by one-third under the pressure of Wall Street financial capital, chaos immediately occurred in the capitalist world market, and the currencies of Western European countries were devalued one after another. The Labor government wants to exchange this great auction of selling out the interests of the British people for further "aid" from the United States. However, the direct result of devaluation will be industrial stagnation and economic decline that will follow Wall Street capital export and dumping of American goods. Therefore, the devaluation of the pound sterling will not only fail to alleviate but will only further deepen the serious economic situation and dollar crisis in Britain and other countries. Because the devaluation of the pound sterling has actually cut wages, the class struggle within these countries is becoming increasingly acute. Britain, France, Italy and other countries are currently facing strong resistance from the working class. At present, more than four million workers across Britain are demanding wage increases.

　　国际一周
    中华人民共和国诞生全世界人民热烈欢呼　
    划出中国历史的新时代——人民民主时代的中国人民政治协商会议，已于二十一日在北京开幕。这个会议是宣告人民的新中国诞生的会议，是中华人民共和国的开国大典。正在进行中的这个会议，是在中国人民解放战争取得决定胜利和全国人民革命大团结的基础上召开的，是以苏联为首的世界和平、民主阵营的力量大大超过帝国主义侵略阵营的力量，全世界争取和平的运动愈趋高涨的时候召开的。中国人民在苏联和人民民主国家以及各国进步人民的鼓励之下，战胜了帝国主义及其走狗中国反动派，今天，又以他们自己的胜利加强了世界和平民主阵营，特别是加强了东方被压迫民族争取解放斗争的信心。因此，中国革命的胜利以及在这一基础上召开的中国人民政协会议，具有伟大的国际意义，使世界进步人类为之热烈欢呼。英共、捷共、芬共、世界拥护和平大会常委会、国际民主妇联等均致电中国人民庆祝新中国的诞生。莫斯科各报均刊登大会报道，并全文登载毛主席的开幕词。捷、波、匈、英、法、丹麦等各国进步报纸亦以显著地位刊载中华人民共和国成立的消息。并著论评述。华沙人民论坛报社论说，在资本主义和帝国主义阵线上又打开了一个缺口了。华沙报指出，中国人民已不再是外国资本剥削的对象了。中国人民的胜利乃是本世纪继苏联十月革命和消灭希特勒法西斯主义之后的最伟大事件。伦敦工人日报社论指出，新的中华人民共和国的成立证明美元不是万能的。该报要求承认中华人民共和国。柏林苏占区电台称，中国人民政协会议引起了国际政界的极大注意。国外侨胞更欢欣鼓舞，热烈庆祝祖国的新生。
    　　　　美帝间谍的可耻下场　匈牙利叛国罪犯处刑
    匈牙利叛国案自十六日在布达佩斯开审后，经过对被告的逐一审讯与对证人的审问，二十日辩论终结，二十一日检察长总结审讯后，八名被告在铁证如山的面前不得不表示服罪。人民法庭乃于二十四日宣判，判处主犯拉伊克等三人死刑，马尔费等二人交军事法庭，余二犯无期徒刑，一犯九年徒刑。检察长在总结审讯时，历举证据及被告与证人的口供，证明八名罪犯是帝国主义的间谍，他们阴谋武装政变，取消人民民主，废除国有化，取消土地改革，造成匈牙利地主资本家统治的复辟，出卖民族独立和国家主权给铁托匪帮和美帝国主义，罪大恶极，死有余辜。被告等之所以服罪，并不是由于悔过，只是因为在证据确凿的事实面前，无法抵赖。讯审的总结特别指出，在布达佩斯的审判，不仅是对拉伊克等八人的审判，也是对在人民民主国家进行间谍、破坏等阴险的罪恶勾当的美帝国主义及其主要帮凶铁托匪帮的审判。这次审判揭发了铁托与帝国主义很早就勾结在一起。真理报在二十一日社论中说明，帝国主义者在人民民主国家中企图依靠右翼政党失败后，就把希望寄托在间谍、叛变、谋杀与干涉等阴谋上，在这中间，法西斯铁托集团就充当了主要的角色。匈京的审判说明了任何替帝国主义效劳的间谍活动，都拯救不了它自身的灭亡。
    　　　　国际和平斗争日即届　各国人民准备大示威
    各国人民继续加紧准备十月二日“国际和平斗争日”。世界工联于本周发出号召，敦促一切国家的工会在这一天行动起来，表现他们维护国际和平与团结以及全世界劳动人民休戚相关的意志，并加倍努力，保证这一天的和平运动具有最大的群众性。波兰工会决定于九月二十七日至十月一日在各地组织游行示威，二日在华沙等大城市召开群众大会。英、德、意及以色列等国和平委员会亦已发出号召，号召届时召开大会，反对北大西洋公约，反对在西德建立分裂“国家”和反对把人类投入新战争的深渊。法国各地和平投票仍广泛进行中。蒙梭、里昂等各大矿区及工业城市的劳动人民不顾警察的阻挠进行了投票。全法各人民团体纷纷宣布将参加国际和平斗争日的示威。中国人民也正积极准备“国际和平斗争日”的活动，届时全国各主要城市将举行集会和示威游行，世界和平大会中国分会将于北京正式成立。中国人民“国际和平斗争日”的示威将与对中华人民共和国诞生的庆祝融成一个轰轰烈烈的群众运动。
    和平与战争的斗争也在纽约佛拉辛草地联合国大会的会场上进行着。第四届联大已于二十日开幕。在美国代表操纵和活动下，仰承美国鼻息的菲律宾代表罗慕洛当选了大会主席。同时，大会在选出苏联等代表任副主席及六个委员会主席等人选之后，于二十一日起开始一般性发言。象上几次大会一样，苏联代表团仍是大家注意的中心。苏首席代表维辛斯基在二十三日大会发表演说，详细分析美国所制造的北大西洋公约和马歇尔计划破坏联合国宪章的事实，并以苏联与人民民主国家的建设成就与坚持和平与国际安全的政策，与美英的备战政策作一显明的对比。维辛斯基在会上提出苏联政府三点具体建议，即大会谴责美英等国进行新战争准备，无条件禁用和严格管制原子武器，以及敦促一切国家以和平方式解决争议，安理会五个常任理事国应担负主要责任，缔结和平公约。
    　　　　苏联向联大和平建议赢得各国人民热烈拥护
    维辛斯基在演说中并痛斥广州匪帮蒋廷黻秉承其美国主子的命令诽谤苏联。指出蒋廷黻伪造历史只足以证明他所代表的中国反动集团对一切进步和民主的事物之兽性的仇恨而已。只有苏联早在二十五年前就废除了沙皇时代一切侵犯中国主权的条约，并与中国签订了关于解决两国间问题的基本原则的协定，这是大国尊重中国独立的唯一平等条约。维辛斯基的演说和建议，得到了世界爱好和平国家和人民的赞同和拥护。中国进步报纸都以显著地位发表维辛斯基的演说。
    在大会正在进行之际，杜鲁门于二十三日宣称最近在苏联曾发生原子爆炸事件，美英加等国资产阶级报纸接着就大肆喧嚷散布惊恐的言论。二十四日塔斯社发表声明说，苏联正在大规模建设工作中使用最新式技术的爆炸。苏联早在一九四七年就握有原子武器的秘密，但苏联“信守着而且今后仍将信守无条件禁用原子武器的立场”。不难看出，杜鲁门故作骇人听闻的宣布，一方面是为了转移世界舆论的视线，同时也是替美帝国主义加紧军备竞赛的阴谋制造借口。但苏联早已掌握原子能这一事实说明苏联在全般国力上，包括科学技术在内，都已超过美国，因此就能与世界上爱好和平的国家和人民一起，更有把握地保卫世界的持久和平。
    　　　　美共热烈纪念党的生日　英四百万工人要求增资
    美国共产党在为反对美国法西斯主义增长、华尔街集团摧残工人权利和人民权利，并为争取和平与民主而进行的坚决斗争中，纪念它诞生的三十周年。在纽约麦迪逊广场举的行纪念会上参加者达两万人。美共总书记但尼斯说：“我们将堵塞帝国主义、法西斯主义和战争阵营的道路。对于那些想要宣布我们的党为非法的人们，我们说‘此路不通’。”美国工人阶级这个正义的呼声，受到全世界劳动人民及一切爱好和平、民主人们的同情和支持。中共中央毛主席在致福斯特与但尼斯的贺电中着重指出，美国的未来，不属于外强中干的美国反动势力，而属于你们和美国人民。北平人民日报于十九日发表祝贺美共三十周年纪念的评论说，“我们中国共产党人和中国人民将以不断的努力，与美国共产党和美国人民一起，在太平洋两岸共同扼住战争贩子的血手。”
    作为大英帝国的象征的英镑，在华尔街财政资本压力下贬值三分之一以后，资本主义世界市场立即发生混乱，西欧等各国的通货都相继贬值。工党政府想以这种出卖英国人民利益的大拍卖行为来换取美国进一步的“援助”。但是贬值国的直接结果将是跟着华尔街资本输出和美货倾销而来的工业停顿和经济的愈益凋敝。因此，英镑贬值不仅不能减轻而且只有更加加深英国等国严重的经济情势和美元危机。由于英镑贬值实际上削减了工资，使这些国家内部的阶级斗争愈益尖锐，英法意等国现正面临工人阶级的强大反抗。目前在英国各地要求增加工资的工人已达四百余万。　　　　　　　　　　【新华社北京二十九日电】
