Simonov's Speech to Shanghai Youth and Students
　　Dear friends!
　　On behalf of the Soviet cultural, artistic, and scientific workers' delegation, and on behalf of Soviet writers, I extend our sincere fraternal greetings to the student representatives of Shanghai and all progressive youth present!
　　We Soviets are well aware of the advanced and progressive traditions that Shanghai students have consistently demonstrated. We remember that Shanghai students, together with the Shanghai working class, carried out the struggle against imperialism on May 30, 1925. We know that Shanghai students participated in the Northern Expedition in 1927. We know how Shanghai students fought against the Japanese invaders. We remember how they opposed American imperialist interference in the Chinese government.
　　Finally, we know that 20,000 Shanghai students have joined the army to work and serve the people since the liberation of Shanghai. On behalf of the Soviet people, and especially the Soviet youth, we sincerely hope that Shanghai and all Chinese students will work and study successfully for the benefit of the great Chinese people.
　　Today I would like to tell you about some of the issues that we Soviets are working on in the cultural field. I hope this will be of interest to Chinese youth.
　　First of all, I would like to talk about how we Soviets understand the concept of a "cultured person." We believe that a "cultured person" is a person with the broadest interests, and everything that encourages progressive humanity around the world should be of concern to us Soviet cultured people. Therefore, a Soviet cultured person is a person who is concerned about the struggle between progressive and reactionary forces that is taking place anywhere in the world. When the progressive forces in Spain fought against the reactionaries supported by German and Italian fascism, this event moved every Soviet cultured person. When the Chinese Red Army completed the 25,000-li Long March through nine provinces to reach northern Shaanxi in the battle with the reactionary armies of the Kuomintang, this event also moved every Soviet cultured person, and every Soviet person was familiar with it. When the Japanese invaders trampled on China, burned Chinese cities and villages, and slaughtered the Chinese people, every Soviet cultured person was filled with righteous indignation and protested against this atrocity.
　　We believe that a cultured person should fight for progress, for culture, for the future happiness of his own people and all mankind. Therefore, he should be clear about everything that is happening in the world, and should have his own clear point of view. He should always be able to understand which side is progressive and which side is reactionary, and should always stand firmly on the side of progress and relentlessly fight against reactionary forces in all circumstances.
　　To support progress and oppose reaction is to support the freedom, independence, and equality of all nations on Earth. Because in our view, every nation—whether the largest or the smallest—has an equal right to demand freedom, independence, equality, and the respect of other nations.
　　From the first grade of elementary school to the last grade of university, we have always educated our Soviet youth in the spirit of love for their motherland, love for their own people, and respect for all other nations and their cultures. We believe that only those who deeply love their own motherland, their own people, their own people's history, and their own people's culture can understand that other people also love their own motherland, their own history, and their own culture in the same way, and can deeply respect their patriotic feelings. Only then can they respect the representatives of other peoples as much as they respect themselves, that is, treat them with equality.
　　American imperialists and those who sometimes carry out the tasks given to them by imperialists in the cultural field in order to earn a lot of money or sometimes to earn a little money, imagine the future of the world in this way: they believe that the world should be dominated by New York, and the whole world should eat, drink, and play like Americans. Only American productions are shown in all cinemas, and only American pornographic films are performed in all theaters. Only American detective novels are sold in all bookstores, and the only first-class people in the world are people with American passports, and only one flag is seen all over the world—the American Stars and Stripes. This is how American reactionaries view the future of the world.
　　We Soviets have a completely different view of the future of the world from all progressive forces in the world. We believe that every country in the world should be ruled by its own people, every country in the world should speak its own mother tongue, improve and advance this language, and at the same time make extensive use of other countries' languages to connect culturally with other friendly peoples. Every country in the world should abide by its own country's reasonable customs. Every country in the world should develop its own progressive films, dramas, and literature, and widely exchange cultural treasures with all other countries on an equal basis. In all remote places and magnificent hotels in the world, people should equally respect the people of every country, regardless of the size of their country or the color of their skin, and the equal flags of all countries should fly all over the world, with each country hanging its own flag.
　　We believe that our view of the future of the world is the view of a cultured person. We believe that the American reactionaries' view of the future of the world is the view of barbarians who do not know what true progress and true culture are.
　　In our country, we are now carrying out huge peaceful construction work. In this construction, cultural construction occupies a huge position. I would like to say a few words about this cultural construction. Now all the people in the Soviet Union are studying. In our country, not only children study in schools, which is compulsory education; in our country, there are also tens of thousands of adults studying. We have many schools for adults, where people who have not caught up with their studies in childhood continue to work during the day and study at night in order to have the opportunity to enter university.
　　In our country, farmers also study, they study in order to be able to use tractors and other agricultural machines. In our country, workers also study, they study in order to become technicians, and technicians study in order to become engineers. We have many large factories where people work during the day and study at night. Every ordinary worker can receive a full education, so that he can become an engineer from a worker and get an engineer's degree. We have millions of intellectuals in our country who study in Marxist-Leninist night schools. They study because they want to become more cultured, highly educated, philosophical people, so that after they have extremely high culture, they can better complete the duties given to them by the state and society.
　　An important position in our education system is occupied by the training and education of literary and artistic workers. As a writer, I would like to talk about this in more detail.
　　We believe that the primary and only responsibility of literary and artistic workers is to serve the people. The happiness of the people can only be achieved through the road of progress and democracy, through the road of protecting the interests of ordinary people, and through the road of equality between people and between nations.
　　Therefore, only those artists who fight against reactionaries, strive for national equality, strive for democracy, strive for progress, and strive for the happiness of the broad masses of people can serve the people. Our entire education system for literature and art is based on this concept of the education of writers and artists. We say: "An artist is a servant of the people." An artist who is unwilling to be a servant of the people will ultimately become a servant of the reactionaries, because there is no middle road. Our education and training of artists has its own purpose, which is to educate young writers, actors, directors, painters, and musicians to serve the people as well as possible and as beneficially as possible. In order to serve the people, one must be familiar with the people's past and future. We cherish and value our centuries of history very much. We know very well that after the revolution, after the people were liberated, it was our people who were the masters of all cultural treasures, which were formed in the many centuries of history of our country. We absorb everything that we consider precious from the cultural history of our people, everything that has overcome evil with good over the centuries, and everything that remains in the memory of the people today due to the strength of the people and the cherishing of the interests of the people. We study the treasures of our old culture, and we demand that our young literary, artistic, and cultural workers study and deeply know all these treasures.
　　In addition to understanding the past, our young literary, artistic, and cultural workers should also have a good understanding of the present. They should know the modern life of their own people. This life is striving forward along the road of progress. Those who do not understand it will fall behind, and truly progressive artists should move forward, not backward. This is the fundamental difference between them and backward, reactionary artists.
　　In our country, those who were illiterate ten years ago have now become engineers and factory managers; those who were shepherds fifteen years ago have now become agricultural technicians. Deserts have become blooming gardens, and villages have become cities—this rapid development has taken place in our country. To write this development in books, to express it in dramas or films, to draw it in books, can only be done by those who move forward as quickly as time itself. Therefore, we believe that knowing the life around us means moving forward in the same way as this life. We ask all artists to do this, we study this, and we educate young art and literature workers with this.
　　We believe in the future, and we know very well that this future belongs to our youth. And the cause of cultivating these youths falls on our shoulders. Therefore, we believe that writers, actors, and artists who only create their own works and do not intend to cultivate young people cannot fulfill their responsibility to society. We believe that an editor of a magazine who does not cultivate some young and talented writers is not a good editor. We believe that a director who does not cultivate a group of young and talented directors and actors is not a good director. We believe that an artist who does not teach young and talented painters from the people on the podium is not a good artist. We believe that in this way, they cannot fulfill their responsibility to society. Then we will represent the people and use all the power of persuasion and education to call on them to fulfill this responsibility to the youth.
　　Our common teacher, Comrade Stalin, is educating us to treat the youth in this way. This is how we are working hard to do it, and this is the spirit in which we are striving to cultivate those who do not yet understand this.
　　Our delegation came to the new democratic and free China in the happiest days of the entire history of the Chinese people. On the first of last month, we personally saw the grand review of the strong people's forces in Beijing, when Comrade Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people, stood on the rostrum and solemnly announced the establishment of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China.
　　We saw how the Chinese people joyfully and solemnly commemorated their own victory, but we Soviets understand more clearly that this victory was won by the people through a long and arduous journey, a great struggle, great sacrifices, and with their heroic spirit and iron will.
　　I am a representative of a generation of Soviet people who were born a few years before our great October Revolution, and who lived their own conscious lives in the years of the establishment of Soviet power. Recalling my own life, and at the same time knowing clearly the lives of my comrades, I can tell you that this generation of young people in the Soviet Union was educated in such a way that they always understood China and the Chinese revolution, so that they were always rejoiced by all the victories that the Chinese people had won in their many years of revolutionary struggle, and at the same time were always distressed by their temporary setbacks in this struggle. From a very young age, we have been your true friends, and the enemies of your enemies.
　　When we were elementary school students, we knew the name of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, and knew that he respected Lenin.
　　When we were second-year students twenty-two years ago, we were happy when we heard that the National Revolutionary Army had liberated Shanghai. I still remember that we were so happy that we recited a poem written by our poet Mayakovsky at that time. In this poem, he narrates how the workers asked him to recite the best of his poems when he read his poems to them. And at this time, Mayakovsky had already received the news that the Chinese National Revolutionary Army had captured Shanghai. At that time, he did not read the poem, but announced loudly in the hall: Shanghai has been liberated. Because he knew that this news was better than his best poem for the Soviet workers who warmly sympathized with the Chinese people's liberation struggle. After hearing this news, the Soviet people jumped up with joy. Mayakovsky wrote about this situation:
　　"As if to roll up the iron leaves,
　　The power of revelry is increasing and increasing,
　　Five minutes, ten minutes, fifteen minutes,
　　The city of Yaroslavl is applauding..."
　　Together with the workers gathered in this hall protesting against those carrying Chiang Kai-shek, and together with the city of Yaroslavl where Mayakovsky read his poem, the entire Soviet people and the entire Soviet youth cheered and applauded for the victory of the Chinese people.
　　Then how deeply did we hate the enemies of the Chinese people? I remember very clearly that when the despicable and shameless Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the people and became a butcher and traitor, 10,000 miles away, in a small city in the Soviet Union, we senior students marched in protest, carrying a figure of Chiang Kai-shek with the words "traitor" written on it, parading through the city.
　　When my comrades and I were studying in the first year of university, it was when the Chinese Red Army completed their 25,000-li Long March through nine provinces. At that time, we knew very little about this, but we clearly remember how we crowded around the Chinese map hanging on the wall of the auditorium after class, how we argued with each other, and how we all cheered for the success of the Chinese revolution.
　　The year we graduated from university was when Japanese imperialism invaded China and occupied all of its major cities. Friends, you will believe me, although we are thousands of kilometers away from you, we hated Japanese militarism as much as you did at that time.
　　And after two years, I myself and many of my comrades personally heard the whistling of Japanese bullets and the roar of bombs. This was in the summer of 1939, when the Chinese people and Japanese militarists were fighting here, and we were fighting them at Nomonhan on the Mongolian border. That is, we and you were destroying the same enemy in the world and the same enemy of our two great nations—Japanese militarism.
　　For four years, the Soviet people, the Soviet youth, dressed in military uniforms, under the leadership of the great Stalin, shouldered the heavy burden of fighting against the fascist forces, and defeated this fascism at the cost of huge sacrifices. Every day, every hour, every minute, during these four years, we were entirely engaged in this struggle. But the characteristic of the Soviet people is that they can always see the prospects of struggle and victory in the most difficult circumstances, and always remember all the advanced forces in the world who are against imperialism and reactionary forces. Throughout the four years of the most cruel but finally victorious bloody war against fascism in human history, we remembered the Chinese people and their struggle under the leadership of the Communist Party and its leader Mao Zedong. We remembered you. Dear friends, when we were fighting in besieged Leningrad, we remembered you. When our enemies were only 100 kilometers away from Moscow, we remembered you. When we defended Stalingrad, we clearly remembered that there was a great Chinese people fighting against the invaders with us; we remembered that there was a revolutionary and fighting Eighth Route Army with us.
　　We know, we have heard from many Chinese comrades, that the victory won by our people and our army in the anti-fascist struggle encouraged our Chinese friends who were fighting against the invaders and against the reactionaries. But dear friends, I would like you to know another thing, that it was not very important and precious for us Soviets, for those who were fighting against the fascists on the battlefield, to know that the soldiers of the Eighth Route Army were fighting against the invaders thousands of miles away from the Soviet-German front? Was it not very important and precious for us to know that the Chinese people were paying attention to our struggle and sympathizing with our struggle?
　　Most of us are still far from being old, but as you can see, we have a very old friendship.
　　Long live the long-standing, faithful and reliable traditional friendship between the two great peoples of China and the Soviet Union!
　　Our two countries' youth, in front of them is placed an endless field of work, in front of them unfolds the most beautiful prospect in the world, we should maintain, consolidate, and develop this great friendship.
　　Long live the youth of two great countries!

### 西蒙诺夫向上海青年学生界的演说

　　西蒙诺夫向上海青年学生界的演说
    亲爱的朋友们！
    我代表苏联文化艺术科学工作者代表团，代表苏联作家，向在座的上海的学生代表和全体进步青年致我们诚挚的兄弟的敬礼！
    我们苏联人很清楚地知道：上海学生所经常卓越表现的那种先进的进步的传统。我们记得：上海学生和上海工人阶级一道，曾在一九二五年五月三十日进行了反对帝国主义的斗争。我们知道：上海学生参加了一九二七年的北伐战争。我们知道：上海学生怎样和日本侵略者进行斗争。我们记得：他们怎样反对美国帝国主义干涉中国政府。
    最后，我们知道现在两万上海学生在上海解放以后加入军队工作，为人民服务。我们代表苏联人民，首先代表苏联青年衷心希望上海和全中国学生，以在学业和工作中的成功，来为伟大的中国人民谋福利。
    我今天愿意告诉你们，苏联人在文化方面工作的几个问题，这个，我希望：对于中国青年是有趣味的。
    首先，我想谈一谈我们苏联人对“文化人”的理解如何。我们认为：“文化人”是有最广泛的兴趣的这样一种人，凡是鼓励全世界进步人类的一切都应当是我们苏联文化人所关心的。因此，苏联文化人是这样一种人：他关心世界任何地方所发生的进步势力与反动势力的斗争。当西班牙进步力量与德意法西斯主义所支持的反动派作斗争的时候，这件事曾激动过每一个苏联文化人。当中国红军在与国民党反动的军队作战中完成二万五千里长征经过九省而进入陕北的时候，这件事也曾激动过每一个苏联文化人，同时每一个苏联人也都熟悉地知道它。当日本侵略者蹂躏中国，烧毁中国的城市和乡村，残杀中国人民的时候，每一个苏联文化人都义愤填胸，抗议这种暴行。
    我们认为：文化人应当为进步，为文化，为自己人民以及全人类幸福的未来作斗争，因此，他应当清楚在世界发生着的一切，应当有他自己明确的观点，应当经常能够明了：进步在那一方面，反动在那一方面，同时应当经常在一切情况下坚决地站在进步方面，无情地与反动势力作斗争。
    拥护进步，反对反动——这就是说拥护地球上一切民族的自由、独立和平等；因为在我们看来，每一民族——无论是最大的或者是最小的——都有同等的权利要求自由独立、平等以及其他民族对它的尊敬。
    从小学一年级起到大学最后一年级止，我们都是一直以对自己祖国的热爱，对于自己人民的热爱的精神，以对其他一切民族和他们文化的尊敬的精神，来教育我们苏联的青年。我们认为：只有深爱自己祖国、自己人民、自己人民的历史、自己人民的文化的人，才能够了解其他人民也同样热爱自己的祖国，自己的历史和自己的文化，才能够深刻尊敬他们爱国的感情，才能够和尊敬自己一样尊敬其他人民的代表，也就是说以平等的精神对待他们。
    美帝国主义者和那些有时为了赚一笔大钱也有时为赚一点小钱而在文化领域中完成的帝国主义者所给予他们的任务的人们，这样来想象全世界的未来，他们认为：全世界要由纽约来支配，全世界都照美国人那样吃喝玩乐。在一切的电影院里只有美国的出品，在一切戏院里只演美国的色情狂的片子。在一切书店里只卖美国侦探小说，在全世界只有一等的人物——也就是带着美国护照的人民，在全世界上只看一种旗帜——美国的星条旗。美国反动派都这样来看世界的未来。
    我们苏联人同世界一切进步力量看世界的未来就完全不同，我们认为：世界上每一个国家由他们本国的人民来统治，世界每一个国家说自己祖国的语言，改善并向前推进这个语言，同时又广泛地利用别的国家的语言来在文化上与其他友爱的人民联系。世界上每一个国家遵守自己国家合理的习惯。世界上每一个国家发展自己进步的电影、戏剧和文学，在平等的基础上广泛地和一切其他国家交换文化珍品。在世界一切偏僻的地方和富丽的旅馆里，人们都同样尊敬每一个国家的人民，不管他的国家大小怎样，不管他的皮肤颜色怎样，同时在全世界飘扬着一切国家的平等的旗帜，每一个国家悬着自己的旗帜。
    我们认为：我们对世界未来的看法是文化人的看法。我们认为：美国反动派对世界未来的看法是不知真正进步和真正文化为何物的野蛮人的看法。
    在我们国内，我们现在正进行着巨大的和平建设工作。在这个建设中，文化建设占着巨大的地位。关于这种文化建设，我想说几句话。现在全苏联人民都在学习。在我们那里，不仅儿童在学校里念书，这是义务教育；在我们那里还有成千成万的成年人学习，我们有许多为成年人而设的学校，在这里没有赶上在儿童时代完成学业的人们，一方面继续日间工作，一方面在晚上学习，以便有机会进入大学。
    在我们那里农民也学习，他们学习是为了会运用拖拉机和其他的农业机器。在我们那里工人也学习，他们学习是为了成为技师，而技师学习则又是为了成为工程师。我们有许多大的工厂，人们在这里白天工作，夜间学习。每一个普通工人可以受到全部教育，使他从工人变成工程师，得到工程师的学位。我们那里有几百万知识分子，在马列主义夜校里学习，他们学习是因为他们想着成为更有文化的，高等教育的，了解哲学的人，成为这样的人，有了极高的文化以后，他们就能够更好地来完成国家和社会所给予他们的职务。
    在我们教育制度中占重要地位的是文学和艺术工作者的培养和教育，关于这个，我以作家的身份愿意更讲得详细些。
    我们认为：文学和艺术工作者首要的和唯一的职责就是为人民服务，人民的幸福只有经过进步和民主的道路，只有经过保护普通人民利益的道路，只有经过人与人之间和民族之间的平等的道路，才能够得到。
    因此，为人民服务，只有这样的艺术家才能作到，他们为了反对反动派，争取民族平等，争取民主，争取进步，争取广大人们的幸福而进行斗争。我们文学和艺术整个教育制度就是建立在作家和艺术工作者这种教育的概念之上。我们这样讲：“艺术家，就是人民的仆人。”而不愿意当人民仆人的艺术家，归根结底总要成为反动派的仆人，因为中间道路是没有的。我们艺术家的教育和培养有它自己的目的，那就是教育青年作家、演员、导演、画家、音乐家，尽可能更好地最有利地为人民服务。为了服务于人民，就必须熟知人民的过去和未来。我们对于我们几世纪的历史非常珍惜和重视。我们很清楚地知道，在革命以后，在人民被解放以后，正是我们人民才是一切文化珍品的主人，这些珍品是在我们国家许多世纪的历史中形成的。我们从我们人民文化历史中吸取我们认为珍贵的一切，吸取几世纪以来以善胜恶的一切，吸取由于人民的力量，由于对人民利益的珍视而今天仍然遗留在人民记忆中的一切。我们研究属于我们的旧文化的宝藏，我们要求，我们年青的文学、艺术、文化工作者研究并深切地知道所有这些宝藏。
    除开了解过去以外，我们青年的文学艺术文化工作者还应当很好地了解现在。他们应当知道自己人民的现代生活。这个生活沿着进步的道路奋力向前迈进，谁不了解它，谁就要落伍，而真正进步的艺术家就应当前进，而不应当后退，他和落后的、反动的艺术家基本上不同的地方就在这里。
    在我们国家里，十年前不识字的，现在已经成了工程师和工厂经理；十五年前是牧童的，现在已经成了农业技师。荒野变成了百花怒放的花园，乡村成了都市——这种突飞猛进的发展就发生在我们国家里。把这个发展写在书里，表现在戏剧或电影里，画在书里，那只有和时间同样迅速前进的人们才能做到。因此，我们认为：认识周围的生活，这就是说同这个生活一样地前进。我们要求一切艺术家这样作，我们学习这个，同时以这个来教育青年的艺术和文学工作者。
    我们相信未来，我们很清楚地知道：这个未来是属于我们青年的。而培养这些青年的事业又落在我们肩上。因此，我们认为：只创造自己的作品而不打算培养青年的这样的作家、演员、艺术家是不能完成他对于社会的责任的。我们认为：杂志的编辑不培养一些年轻的有天才的作家，那他就不是好的编辑。我们认为：导演家不培养一群年轻的有天才的导演和演员，就不是好的导演家。我们认为：一个艺术家不在讲台上教授来自民间的有天才的年轻的画家，那就不是好的艺术家。我们认为：这样，他们就不能完成他们对社会的责任。那样我们就要代表人民用全部说服教育的力量，号召他们完成这个对青年的责任。
    我们共同的导师斯大林同志就是这样教育我们对待青年的。我们也就是这样努力来作，也就是以这样的精神努力培养那些还不了解这个的人们。
    我们代表团在中国人民全部历史过程中最幸福的日子里来到民主自由的新中国。上月一日我们在北京亲眼看到雄厚的人民力量的大检阅，那时候中国人民领袖毛泽东同志站在主席台上，郑重地宣告了中华人民共和国中央政府的成立。
    我们看见了中国人民怎样欢欣鼓舞地隆重纪念他们自己的胜利，但是我们苏联人更清楚地了解这个胜利是人民经过长期艰苦的旅程，伟大的斗争，重大的牺牲，用他们英勇的精神和钢铁的意志争取得来的。
    我是这样一代苏联人民的代表，他们出生在我们伟大的十月革命前的几年，他们在苏维埃政权建立的年代里过着他们自己自觉的生活。回想起自己的生活，同时又清楚地知道自己同志们的生活，因此我可以告诉你们：我们这一代青年在苏联是受着这样一种教育，使他们经常了解中国和中国革命，使得他们经常因为中国人民在他们多年革命斗争中所获得的一切胜利而欢欣鼓舞，同时也经常为他们在这个斗争中一时的失利而苦恼。从很年轻的时候起，我们就是你们真正的朋友，就是你们敌人的敌人。
    当小学生的时候，我们就知道孙中山博士的名字，知道他敬重列宁。
    在二十二年前作二年级的学生的时候，当我们听到国民革命军解放了上海的时候，我们就高兴过。我还记得，我们那样高兴，使得我们朗诵起我们诗人马雅可夫斯基那时所写的一首诗。在这首诗里他叙述：工人如何在他给他们读他的诗的时候，要求他向他们朗诵他所作的诗里面的最好的一首。而在这个时候马雅可夫斯基就已经得到了中国国民革命军夺取上海的消息。当时他不读诗，而高声地在会场里宣布：上海解放了。因为他知道：这个消息对于热烈同情中国人民解放斗争的苏联工人比他最好的诗还要好。苏联人民听到了这个消息以后，就欢跃欲狂地跳了起来，关于这种情形，马雅可夫斯基曾写过：
    “好象要把铁叶揉卷起来，
    狂欢的力量在增涨在增涨，
    五分钟，十分钟，十五分钟，
    雅罗斯拉夫城在鼓掌。……”
    和聚会在这个大厅里的工人抗议抬着蒋介石的人的人们一道，和马雅可夫斯基在那里读诗的雅罗斯拉夫城一道，全苏联人民，全苏联青年都为中国人民的胜利欢腾鼓掌。
    那么我们对于中国人民的敌人怎样深恶痛绝呢？我记得很清楚，当卑鄙无耻的蒋介石背叛了人民，而成为刽子手和卖国贼的时候，在一万里以外，在苏联的一个小的城市里，我们高年级的学生游行示威，表示我们的抗议，抬着蒋介石的人形，上面写着“卖国贼”，在全城游行。
    我和我的同志们在大学一年级读书的时候，正是中国红军通过九省，完成了他们二万五千里长征的时候。那时，关于这个我们知道得很少，但是我们清楚地记得：我们下了课以后大家怎样拥挤在挂在礼堂墙上的中国地图的周围，我们自己又怎样彼此互相争论，我们大家又怎样为中国革命事业的成功而欢欣鼓舞。
    我们在大学毕业的那一年正是日本帝国主义侵入中国，占领了他的所有的大城市的时候。朋友们，你们会相信我，虽然我们和你们相隔几千公里，但我们在那个时候也和你们一样地痛恨日本军国主义的。
    而经过了两年，我本人和我的许许多多的同志们就亲自听到了日本枪弹的呼啸声和炸弹的吼声。这是在一九三九年夏天，那时候中国人民和日本军国主义者在这里作战，而我们和他们又在蒙古边境诺门坎地方作战，也就是我们和你们正在消灭着世界上同一的敌人和我们两大民族的同一敌人——日本军国主义者。
    在四年当中，苏联人民，苏联青年们，穿上军服，在伟大的斯大林领导下，肩负起与法西斯武装斗争的重担，以巨大牺牲的代价战胜了这个法西斯。每一天，每一小时，每一分钟，在这四年当中，我们整个地从事于这一斗争。但是苏联人民的特点，就是他们在最困难的环境里永远能看见斗争和胜利的远景，永远在怀念反对帝国主义和反动势力的全世界上一切先进的力量。在人类史上最残酷的但是终于战胜了法西斯的流血战争整个四年当中，我们怀念着中国人民和他们在共产党和它的领袖毛泽东领导下所进行的斗争。我们怀念着你们。亲爱的朋友们，当着我们在被包围的列宁格勒作战的时候，我们怀念着你们。当我们的敌人离莫斯科只有一百公里的时候，我们怀念着你们。当我们保卫斯大林格勒的时候，我们清楚的记得，有一个为反对侵略者而战的伟大的中国人民和我们在一道；我们记得，有一个充满革命精神的、战斗的八路军和我们在一道。
    我们知道，我们从很多中国同志口中听到了，我们人民和我们军队在反法西斯斗争中所获得的胜利，鼓舞了和侵略者以及和反动派斗争的我们的中国朋友。但是亲爱的朋友，我愿意你们知道另外一件事情，那就是在苏德战线数千里地以外有八路军的战士们和侵略者作战，对于我们苏联人，对于在战场上和法西斯作战的人们，不是很重要而且很宝贵的吗？知道中国人民注意我们的斗争，并且同情我们的斗争，对于我们不是很重要而且很宝贵的吗？
    我们中间大部分还远不是老年人，但是正如你们所看见的，我们已经有了很老的交情了。
    中苏两大人民历史悠久的、忠实可靠的友好传统万岁！
    我们两国的青年们，在他们面前摆着无穷尽的工作园地，在他们面前展开世界上最美丽的远景，我们应当保持、巩固、发展这一伟大的友谊。
    两个伟大国家的青年万岁！
