Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 29th. TASS Moscow, October 27th: *Pravda*'s Paris correspondent Zhukov reports on the shameful failure of the French reactionary group's trial of renowned writer Aragon (director of *Ce Soir*) and André Garaudy, deputy editor-in-chief of *l'Humanité*. The author points out that French reactionary groups are adopting the same strategy in France as the American reactionary groups are widely implementing to suppress progressive forces. Recently, reactionary factions have fabricated numerous trials against progressive public leaders and democratic newspapers. To understand the scale of the movement launched by French reactionaries, it is enough to say that the issue of stripping the privileges of more than twenty People's Representatives—Communist Party members—has been brought before the parliament. The reactionary groups want to try these communists on various pretexts.

Referring to the incident of the accusation against Aragon and Garaudy itself, the author says that on November 11th of last year, Paris police blocked the peaceful demonstration of veterans of the two world wars at the Champs-Élysées, firing on the demonstrators. This bloody act not only aroused indignation among the broad public in France, but newspapers around the world also published reports about the Paris shooting of veterans demonstrating. However, this did not prevent the French authorities from launching accusations and trials against the progressive newspapers *l'Humanité* and *Ce Soir*, accusing them of spreading "false news" and "insulting" French Interior Minister Moch. The reactionary faction's accusations against Aragon and Garaudy were entirely fabricated and exposed on the first day of the trial. Thirty-one witnesses unanimously testified that the reports in *l'Humanité* and *Ce Soir* regarding the police's violence against the veterans' demonstration were consistent with the facts. Because the circumstances of the fabricated charges were so obvious, and because the people's indignation caused by these trials was so strong, the court did not dare to convict anyone and acquitted Aragon and Garaudy. Obviously, the French reactionary faction's plan, instigated by the United States, suffered another shameful failure. In fact, this trial confirmed the correctness of the reports in *l'Humanité* and *Ce Soir*, thereby also confirming the crimes of the police who, under the orders of Interior Minister Moch, fired on peaceful demonstrators.

　　法反动派枪击和平示威者后　
    图嫁罪共产党人遭失败           
    阿拉贡及加里尔均开释
    【新华社北京二十九日电】塔斯社莫斯科二十七日讯：真理报驻巴黎记者朱可夫报道法国反动集团所制造的对名作家阿拉贡（今晚报社长）及人道报副总编辑安德烈·加里尔之审判的可耻失败。作者指出：法国反动集团正在法国采取与美国反动集团压迫进步势力所广泛施行的同样战略。反动派最近制造了许多对进步公众领袖及民主报纸的审判。为了了解法国反动派所发动的运动的规模，说出一点就够了：剥夺二十多个人民代表——共产党议员特权的问题，已提到议会面前。反动集团想借种种口实，来审判这些共产党人。
    作者论及对阿拉贡及加里尔之控诉的事件本身时说，去年十一月十一日，巴黎警察曾在艾利斯广场阻挠两次世界大战退伍军人的和平示威行列的行进，向示威者开枪。这一血腥行动不仅在法国广大公众间引起愤慨，全世界的报纸也都发表了关于巴黎枪击示威的退伍军人的报道。但是，这并未能阻止法国当局发动对进步报纸人道报和今晚报的控诉和审判，这些报纸被控以散布“不真实消息”和“侮辱”法国内政部长莫克的罪名。反动派对阿拉贡及加里尔提出控诉的罪名的全属捏造，在审判的第一天就被揭穿了。三十一个证人一致证明，人道报与今晚报关于警察对两次大战退伍军人示威行列施行暴力的报道与实情相符。由于捏造罪名的情形是如此明显，由于这些审判所引起的人民的愤慨是如此强烈，使得法庭不敢判决任何罪名，而开释了阿拉贡和加里尔。显然由美国授意所促成的法国反动派的计划，又一次遭受了可耻的失败。事实上，这次审判因证实了人道报和今晚报报道的正确，从而也就证实了奉莫克内长之命向和平示威者开枪的警察的罪行。
