　　The Ballad of the Black Stone Slope Coal Mine (11)
    Kang Zhuo
    It is said that Little Foreign Devil liked Da San very much ever since he met him. Although he wasn't like Da San, who wanted to make a friend, he always felt comfortable talking to Da San; besides, since he took Da San to see the play last year and saw Da San staring at the Bai Quan's house absentmindedly, he had wanted to explore Da San's true feelings and find him a good match. However, Da San had been busy at the mine, and Little Foreign Devil couldn't find the time to talk to Da San. These days Da San was free, and he often looked for Little Foreign Devil, so Little Foreign Devil would always go to Da San's house after returning from Yangquan Station, sometimes even bringing his bowl of rice, and the two would talk spiritedly.
    It is said that Little Foreign Devil's talkativeness was like the coal in a large kiln: there was plenty of it. Once he opened his mouth, he'd ramble on about everything under the sun. In the past few days, he had told Da San about the weddings, funerals, family fortunes, bankruptcies, quarrels, temple fairs, and god worship in the village over the past twenty years, one by one. Da San found it very interesting, and later asked him: How did so-and-so's family decline so quickly? How did so-and-so die? He calmly replied, "What's there to say! It's hard to explain! Anyway, they offended Old Man Jubao and Qian Danao! Besides, it's their fate, bad temper, and unpopularity!" Da San asked again, "Are Jubao and Qian Danao so powerful in our village? Why does everyone, regardless of whether they are older or younger than Jubao, call him 'Old Man'?" He said, "He is the head of the village! What's there to say! As for saying that Old Man is powerful, I don't think it's accurate. As long as you behave yourself, you don't have to be afraid of anything. Take me, for example, I'm always useless, and my mouth can't be shut in front of anyone, but when I see Old Man Jubao and Qian Danao, it shuts up. I can't even open my mouth to speak. Haven't I never offended them?" Da San sighed, "Hey! Damn this world, the village is just like the outside!" Little Foreign Devil also sighed, "The world is really not strong! Alas! People, anyway, everyone has their own fate. Aren't the rich also given their blessings by heaven? Every day is half a day less! Who cares!" Da San said, "Speaking of fate, I don't know whether to believe it or not. The rich have great blessings, but these years are different from those years. Even Yan Xishan in Taiyuan is constantly making trouble about preventing and eliminating the communists, so they can't live in peace these years, and they are afraid of some 'communists'! Have you heard of it? But I can't figure out what this 'communist' is." Little Foreign Devil said, "Isn't it said that 'communists kill people like mowing grass, and neither the poor nor the rich can escape'? There has also been anti-communism in the village! Alas! Who can figure these things out? Anyway, when you live to the end, you stretch your legs and it's all over!" Da San said, "But if I die without understanding, I won't be able to close my eyes, I'm not reconciled." Little Foreign Devil said, "Hey! What you said is also true! What can you do if you're not reconciled? People only live one life, no matter how old they get, so what's the point of thinking about those things! We have been doing the same business for generations, Da San, to be frank, why does your mind always seem different from ours?" Da San was talking spiritedly and wanted to continue rambling, but when he heard Little Foreign Devil say this, he felt that he couldn't open his heart and speak frankly to this person, so he decided to shut up. Little Foreign Devil also had a lot to say. The good thing he wanted to arrange for Da San hadn't been mentioned yet! But seeing Da San not speaking, he also felt that the two of them couldn't truly connect. He quickly took back the words that had reached his lips, took out a bag of tobacco, sighed for a while, and went out to find a place with more people to ramble on.
    11. Matchmaking
    After this time, Little Foreign Devil went to Da San's house less often, and he didn't ramble on much anymore. Later, Little Foreign Devil somehow vaguely heard that Yu Bao harbored a lot of resentment towards Da San. He wanted to tell Da San and persuade him to be careful, but when he thought of Da San's stubbornness, he figured that he wouldn't listen to his persuasion, so why cause trouble! As a result, Little Foreign Devil went to Da San's even less. Even the good thing he wanted to arrange for Da San, because of the reasons mentioned above, he thought that even if it was successful, he might not get a good reputation! So he simply gave up on the matter. However, when he saw Da San, he was still as enthusiastic as before. If Da San had any trivial matters, he would still help out, as if he hadn't planned anything against Da San.
    However, the good thing that Little Foreign Devil wanted to arrange for Da San had already been discussed with the Liu Gou family. Liu Gou had served Jubao's father for decades. Later, Jubao married her to one of his errand boys. That guy ate, drank, and had fun, and the couple didn't even raise a child. The man died. Liu Gou had no one to rely on and had also learned to drink and smoke in Jubao's house. Fortunately, she could say a few words to anyone she met, which was a good thing. Her four acres of land were just barely enough to get by with this and that helping out and getting some grain. She cursed Little Foreign Devil whenever they met, but sometimes she would secretly say some serious things. Ever since Little Foreign Devil discussed with her about finding Da San a good match after watching the play last year, she had been very enthusiastic; but since she hadn't found a suitable candidate at the time, she didn't make a sound. Now, she had indeed found two or three candidates, but she couldn't sit or stand still. She immediately wanted Little Foreign Devil to go with her to find Da San; Little Foreign Devil kept making up various reasons to decline, but Liu Gou kept poking him with her finger, scolding, hitting, and pulling him, and he had no choice but to go reluctantly.

　　黑石坡煤窑演义（１１）
    康濯
    却说小洋鬼自从见了大三，就很喜爱他这个人物。他虽不是象大三那样，想交个什么朋友，但他总觉着跟大三说话心眼痛快；再说，自从去年他拉着大三看戏，眼见大三望着白泉家出神，那以后他就想探探大三的虚实，给大三说合一件好事。不过后来大三一直在窑上忙，小洋鬼总没找到工夫跟大三多说话。这些日子大三闲了，大三还短不了找小洋鬼，所以小洋鬼每天从阳泉站上回来，就总是上大三家去，有时没吃饭就端着碗饭去，二人说得真上劲。
    且说小洋鬼这人说话，就象大窑里的炭：多的是。他一张开嘴，山南海北瞎捣拉，几天来把村里二十年的婚丧嫁娶、发家破产、嚷架吵嘴、赶庙敬神……一五一十都告给大三，大三听着很有意思，后来就问他：谁谁怎么一家伙就破落了啊？谁谁又是怎么死的啊？他就平心静气答道：“这有什么说的！说也说不清！反正，他惹了聚宝老人家跟乾大脑呗！再说，也怨他命里该，脾性不好，人缘不对呗！”大三又问道：“聚宝跟乾大脑在咱村就那么厉害？怎么浑村不管比聚宝辈份大呀小的，都叫他‘老人家’？”他道：“人家一村之主呀！那有什么说的！说他老人家厉害吧，我看也不准，只要你安安份份的，也不怕个球。比如我吧，老不成材的，这嘴见了谁也闭不住，可见了聚宝老人家跟乾大脑就闭住了，想说话也张不开嘴了，我还不是没惹过人家？”大三叹息道：“咳！他妈这世道，村里也跟外边一球样！”小洋鬼也叹息道：“世道也真是不强！唉！人嘛，说起来反正是一人一个命，人命由天，老财们不也是天给的福份？过一天少两半天吧！管球它哩！”大三道：“你说这命，我倒是说信不信的。老财福份大么，比方这几年可又跟那几年不同，这会连太原府阎老西也成天闹什么防共灭共的，可见他们这些年也不能安生，要怕什么‘共’啦！你也听说过么？可就是闹不清这‘共’到底是什么。”小洋鬼说：“不是说‘共产杀人如割草，不论穷富皆难逃’么？村里也闹过防共嘛！唉！谁可闹清这些了？反正活到头腿一伸就利索啦！”大三道：“可我一辈子要死个不明不白，我准闭不上眼，不甘心。”小洋鬼说：“嗨！你这话也是！你不甘心有什么法？人活百岁也只一辈子，想那些干球！咱们祖祖辈辈干的一手营生，大三叔，我说句痛快话：怎么你这心眼看着总跟咱们不一样？”大三本来说上了劲，还想捣拉捣拉的，可一听小洋鬼说出这话，又觉着这人也不能掏出心思说个痛快，也就不言声算了。小洋鬼也还有一肚子话，他想给大三说合的那件好事也还没提起哩！但他见大三不言声，也觉着他俩到底不能心碰心，忙把到了嘴边的话便收回去，抽袋烟，唉声叹气一阵，就出去再寻人多的地势捣拉去了。
    十一　说亲
    这一回以后，小洋鬼上大三家去得少了些，也再没有多捣拉过什么了。后来小洋鬼不知怎么隐隐忽忽听到些玉宝对大三仇气不小，他也想去告给大三，打劝打劝他，要他为人当心些；但他想起大三那股劲，盘算着人家也准不听他打劝的，惹那些祸事干什么！这么一来，小洋鬼去大三那就更少了，连他是就想给大三说合的那件好事，也因为上面那些缘由，他思谋着就是说合成了，还不定落上个好不哩！他也就干脆把那事拉倒了，只是他见了大三，倒还跟过去一样热火，大三有什么不痛不痒的小事，他也还去打帮一阵，好象他对大三并没有盘算过什么一样的。
    不过，小洋鬼想跟大三说合的那件好事，却是早就跟柳沟家商议过的。柳沟家这人侍候聚宝他父亲几十年，后来聚宝把她嫁给一个他家跑腿的，那家伙吃喝玩乐，两口子连个孩也没养，男的就死了；柳沟家人没人手没手，还在聚宝家学会了喝酒抽烟，好在她见了什么人也能说上两句，落个好，她四亩地就是这个那个帮两下，打点粮食凑合过。她跟小洋鬼是见面就骂，但有时也悄悄说些正经的。自从去年看戏那回小洋鬼跟她商议，要给大三说合一件好事以后，她就一股热劲；只是当时没寻下合适对象，才没声张。现在，她果真寻下了两三个对象，可就坐也坐不稳，站也站不住，立时就要小洋鬼一道跟她寻大三说去；小洋鬼一个劲编造各种道理，推脱不去，无奈柳沟家便指头逗点着他，又是骂又是打又是拉，他只得勉强去了。
