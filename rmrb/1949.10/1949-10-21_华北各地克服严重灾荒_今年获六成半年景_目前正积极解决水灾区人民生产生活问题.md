Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 19th. This year, the North China region encountered unprecedented droughts, winds, floods, hail, frost, and epidemics, with the floods after July being the most damaging. After the Communist Party committees and the People's Governments at all levels led the masses in rescue efforts, the disasters have now been basically overcome. According to statistics from the end of August, there were more than 40 kinds of pests in the region, spreading across 222 counties. Hailstorms occurred throughout the provinces, with Chahar and Suiyuan being the most severely affected. In Chahar province, over one million mu of land suffered hail damage. This year's floods were the worst in decades. During the floods, many houses collapsed, and farm tools, livestock, and people were washed away. In Tangshan Prefecture alone, incomplete statistics showed that more than 310,000 houses were destroyed. Ninety counties were affected by the floods, with the most severe areas being the northeastern and central parts of Hebei Province, and the areas along the Yellow River breach in Pingyuan Province. In total, various disasters throughout the year, excluding areas where one place suffered multiple disasters, affected approximately 35 million mu of land in North China, accounting for more than 23% of the total cultivated land area, affecting approximately 10 million people, with 3.5 million people being severely affected.

Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, North China carried out a tense struggle to eliminate the famine. During the spring drought, tens of thousands of cadres were organized to go to the countryside to carry out well-digging, canal-opening, water-carrying, and direct-seeding campaigns. According to incomplete statistics, 150,000 earthen wells were dug throughout the region, and 2 million mu of land were directly seeded. Since the beginning of summer, insect, hail, and frost disasters have occurred successively. Under the slogan of "protecting seedlings and saving lives," various localities have launched pest control campaigns. A large number of cadres went to the countryside to assist farmers in killing insects. In Bo Ye, An Guo, and other seven counties alone, 34 members of the Communist Party County Committee and 963 cadres went to the disaster areas to lead the masses in capturing and killing pests. Many areas also universally established pest control headquarters and pest control work teams, mobilizing the broad masses to carry out encirclement and annihilation. In Hebei Province alone, more than 2.48 million people were mobilized, and a total of more than 1.54 million jin of various pests were killed. The pest disaster in the province has basically been eliminated. In terms of preventing floods, before the summer flood season, Party and government organs at all levels convened flood prevention meetings and issued instructions. The North China People's Government allocated 60 million jin of millet and sent water conservancy technicians to various regions to participate in river management projects and step up flood prevention preparations. When the rainy season came and the river water rose sharply, Party, government, military, and civilian personnel in various localities quickly transferred a large number of cadres to participate in and lead the masses in rescue, damming breaches, and flood discharge, patrolling dikes day and night. Approximately 5 million workdays of manpower were invested in flood prevention in Hebei Province alone. Many Communist Party members played exemplary roles in the struggle. For example, Chen Luosan, a Communist Party member from Beizhuang in Changli County, when the water situation was extremely critical and there was no way to stop the breach, wrapped himself in a cotton quilt and bravely drilled into the hole to block the water flow. When everyone dragged him out, he was already unconscious. Tian Shuzheng and Zhu Ruifen, directors of the Beizhuang Women's Federation, shouted "Whoever is not afraid of death, follow me!" during the raging flood, bravely jumped into the water, inspiring more than 2,000 men and women to jump into the water to rescue, and the dangerous project was finally completed. Thanks to the joint efforts of Communist Party members and the broad masses of people, 82 breaches in various rivers have now been blocked, 490 dangerous projects such as collapsed embankments and loopholes have been repaired, 1.25 million cubic meters of soil have been used to rush-build temporary embankments, and 98 li of bank protection have been completed.

This year's disaster relief struggle has gained some experience. The main key to overcoming disasters lies in the strong leadership of Party and government organs, relying on the broad masses of people, and implementing the policy of self-reliance through production. Any prior negligence and complacency, or subsequent panic and forced orders, will suffer significant losses. The most effective way to overcome disasters is to establish various disaster resistance and relief organizations at all levels, such as flood prevention and pest control headquarters, and production and disaster relief committees, and adopt the principle of district and section responsibility, closely connect intelligence, strictly enforce rewards and punishments, and implement joint defense measures. In addition, the favorable conditions of cities should be fully utilized to achieve mutual assistance and support between urban and rural areas. At the same time, the idea of "peasants all over the world are one family" should be promoted, opposing localism, determining that small interests are subordinate to large interests, large interests take care of small interests, and strengthening unity. During the disaster period, all hidden special agents and saboteurs took the opportunity to engage in activities, spreading rumors, inciting the masses, provoking disunity, creating disputes, and committing all kinds of evil. Therefore, it is necessary to be vigilant and promptly expose and eliminate them.

Due to the heroic struggle of the Party, government, army, and people, North China still achieved an average of 65% of a normal harvest this year. At present, the People's Governments at all levels are actively solving the production and living problems of the people in the flood-stricken areas. Among the 10 million disaster victims in North China, approximately 5%, or 500,000 people, need urgent relief. The Communist Party committees and the People's Governments in various localities are now leading the people to drain water and sow wheat on a large scale. According to statistics from 32 counties in the four prefectures of Tianjin, Cangxian, Tongxian, and Baoding in Hebei Province, as of early September, 21.3 million mu of land had been drained. It is estimated that the total area of drained land in the province can reach 80% of the disaster-stricken area. The North China People's Government has allocated 22 million jin of wheat seeds to Hebei and Pingyuan provinces to help disaster victims rush to sow. At the same time, sideline production is being developed, and river management, road construction, canal opening, and land reclamation are being carried out as work relief to solve the current living problems of disaster victims. A rigorous austerity movement is being carried out throughout North China. In all non-disaster areas, a "bowl of rice" (Hebei Province), "handful of rice" (Chahar Province), "one tael of rice" (various organs and troops in North China), and donation and offering campaigns (factories and schools in Beijing, Tianjin, and other cities) have been launched to support the disaster areas with the strength of the entire region. In addition, in terms of passive measures, "not increasing the burden on farmers" and reducing or exempting the burden on people in disaster areas are being implemented. The North China People's Government has promulgated the "Provisional Measures for Reducing and Exempting Agricultural Tax in Disaster Areas in North China" to reduce the burden on people in disaster areas. For disaster victims in need of urgent relief, the North China People's Government has allocated 3 million jin of relief rice to Hebei and Pingyuan provinces and is organizing the relocation of some disaster victims.

　　华北各地克服严重灾荒
  　今年获六成半年景
    目前正积极解决水灾区人民生产生活问题
    【新华社北京十九日电】华北地区今年遭遇了空前未有的旱、风、水、雹、霜、瘟等灾害，尤以七月后的水灾为害最大。经各级中共党委及人民政府领导群众抢救，现已基本上克服了灾难。据八月底统计：全区发生害虫达四十余种，蔓延二百二十二县。雹灾遍及各省，以察、绥最重，察省遭雹灾者达百万余亩。今年水灾，更为数十年所未有。水灾期间，房屋倒塌，农具人畜冲走，为数亦多，仅唐山专区不完全统计，毁房达三十一万多间。受水地区达九十县，最重的是河北省的东北部、中部及平原省沿黄河决口地区。总计全年各种灾害，除一地兼遭数灾者不计外，全华北受灾土地约达三千五百余万亩，占总耕地面积百分之二十三强，受灾人口约达一千万，受灾重的三百五十万。
    在中国共产党和人民政府领导下，华北各地紧张地开展了消灭灾荒的斗争。春旱时，组织了数万干部下乡，开展了打井、开渠、担水、点种运动，据不完全统计：全区打土井十五万眼，点种面积二百万亩。入夏以来，虫、雹、冻灾相继发生，各地在保苗、保命的口号下，先后展开了灭虫运动。大批干部下乡协助农民灭虫。仅博野、安国等七县，即有三十四个中共县委委员和九百六十三个干部，到灾区率领群众捕灭。不少地区并普遍建立剿虫指挥部、灭虫工作队，发动广大群众进行围歼，仅河北省即发动群众二百四十八万余人，共扑灭各种害虫一百五十四万余斤，该省虫灾基本上已被捕灭。在防止水灾方面，夏汛前，各级党政机关，均先后召集防汛会议，发出指示，华北人民政府并拨小米六千万斤，并派出水利技术人员，分赴各区参加治河工程，加紧防汛准备工作。当雨季来临，河水猛涨时，各地党、政、军、民迅速抽调大批干部参加并领导群众抢险、堵口、泄水，昼夜巡堤。河北全省投入防汛人工约五百万工左右。许多共产党员在斗争中起了模范作用，如昌黎县倍庄共产党员陈洛三，当水势十分危急，无法止堵时，便以棉被裹身，奋勇钻进洞口，堵住水流，等到大家把他拖出来时，他已昏迷不醒。倍庄妇会主任田淑正、朱瑞芬在水势汹涌时，高喊：“谁不怕死，跟我来！”奋勇下水，激动二千多男女群众相继下水抢救，险工始得完成。由于共产党员和广大人民的共同努力，现在各河决口已被堵住八十二处，冲塌、漏洞等险工修好四百九十处，临时堤埝的抢筑用土一百二十五万方，完成护岸九十八华里。
    今年的救灾斗争，获得一些经验。战胜灾害的主要关键在于党政机关的坚强领导，依靠广大群众，贯彻生产自救的方针。任何事先疏忽麻痹和事后惊慌失措、强迫命令，均会遭受重大损失。战胜灾害最有效的办法是：逐级建立各种抗灾、救灾组织，如防汛、灭虫指挥部和生产救灾委员会等，并采取分区、分段负责的原则，密切情报连络，严格奖惩纪律，实行连防等措施。此外，要充分利用城市的有利条件，实现城乡互助，互相支援。同时，应发扬“天下农民是一家”的思想，反对本位观点，确定小利服从大利、大利照顾小利，加强统一和团结。在灾害期间，一切暗藏的特务破坏分子乘机活动，制造谣言，煽惑群众，挑拨团结，制造纠纷，无恶不作，因此必须提高警惕，及时加以揭破和扑灭。
    由于党政军民的英勇奋斗，华北全区今年仍获得了平均六成半的年景。目前各级人民政府正积极解决水灾区人民的生产和生活问题。全华北灾民一千万人中，约有百分之五即五十万人需要急赈。各地中共党委和人民政府现正领导人民大量排水种麦，据河北省天津、沧县、通县、保定四个专区三十二县统计，至九月上旬止，已脱地二千一百三十万亩，估计全省脱水地可达受灾地百分之八十。华北人民政府已拨给河北、平原两省麦种二千二百万斤，帮助灾民抢种。同时并开展副业生产和进行治河、修路、开渠、垦荒以工代赈，解决灾民目前的生活问题。华北全区厉行节约运动，在所有非灾区，普遍掀起“一碗米”（河北省）、“一把米”（察哈尔省）、“一两米”（华北各机关、部队）和捐款献物运动（京、津等市工厂、学校），以全区力量支援灾区。此外，在消极方面则做到“不再加重农民负担”及减免灾区人民负担。华北人民政府已颁布“华北区农业税灾情减免暂行办法”减免灾区人民的负担。对于需要急赈的灾民，华北人民政府则已拨给河北、平原两省赈米三百万斤，并正组织一部分灾民外迁。
