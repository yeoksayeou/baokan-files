　　To guarantee the effective elimination of inferior cotton varieties next year,
    Centrally control pure strains of "Si" cotton
    Hebei Provincial Government Issues Instructions on Quality Cotton Procurement and Purity Preservation
    [Baoding Dispatch] To maintain the purity of the "Si" cotton strain, the Hebei Provincial People's Government recently issued instructions "Concerning the Procurement of Quality Cotton and Preservation of Purity." The instructions point out: The main purpose of centrally procuring quality cotton varieties this year (the "Si" cotton promoted in the guidance areas) is to maintain the pure strain of quality cotton, with the aim of universally eliminating native cotton and inferior cotton varieties within five years, so that cotton production in Hebei will be entirely transformed into quality varieties, thereby increasing yield and improving quality. Therefore, the main key to quality cotton procurement and purity preservation this year is to first ensure that this year's quality cotton is completely centrally controlled. Therefore, governments at all levels must pay great attention to this arduous task, and in conjunction with the quality cotton guidance areas, educate farmers to conscientiously carry out seed selection work, and ensure separate harvesting, separate ginning, and separate storage of seeds. The quality cotton procurement work should be closely integrated with and rely on district and village cooperatives. Through the cotton procurement business, cooperatives will gradually develop into sound supply and marketing cooperatives. Ginning mills in each quality cotton guidance area, based on the situation, will entrust the cotton procurement task to district or village cooperatives, sign contracts, provide cotton procurement funds, and establish a legitimate business relationship for cotton procurement; and during the quality cotton procurement period, they will be responsible for technical guidance to the entrusted cooperatives, and provide handling fees to the cooperatives for cotton procurement. This will not only guarantee the task but also develop the cooperative business through cotton procurement, laying the foundation for future supply and marketing operations. Cooperatives should pay attention to the following points when procuring cotton for the ginning mills in the guidance areas: First, our goal is to centrally control quality cotton seeds to avoid affecting the promotion next spring. This point must be firmly grasped and cannot be shaken. This can only be guaranteed by relying on organizational education work; and the freedom of cotton farmers to sell cotton must be carefully respected, and there must be no coercion to sell immediately or store in the cooperative, so as not to increase the concerns of cotton farmers. Second, in accordance with the needs of cotton farmers, in-kind procurement is permissible. Cooperatives can also carry out supply and marketing operations through in-kind barter. Third, carefully identify cotton varieties and grades. To enable village cooperatives to master this technology, prevent disputes, and ensure quality, fixed cotton procurement dates can be set based on the cotton harvest situation in each village, and technical cadres from the guidance area ginning mills and county cooperatives can assist on a regular basis and educate the masses at any time not to mix cotton. Fourth, to ensure that the cottonseeds are well-formed and have good germination, only early-season cotton should be procured. Fifth, if the masses wish to use seed cotton for their own purposes, they can use manual ginning methods to return the seed cotton; but the masses can be educated that quality cotton is more expensive, and it is better to sell quality cotton and buy ordinary cotton cheaper. Sixth, to implement the policy of purchasing quality cotton at high prices, the cotton procurement price will be notified to the cooperatives by the ginning mill at any time according to the company's pricing. Cooperatives can only accept the handling fee given by the ginning mill as operating profit and cannot raise or lower the cotton procurement price on their own. The actual price received by cotton farmers must be guaranteed. Seventh, if the masses want to organize ginning themselves, it is necessary to mobilize and educate them to explain that public procurement is to concentrate seeds to maintain purity, and it is best to have the ginning mill gin the cotton. As for the cotton that the masses retain for seeds, efforts should also be made to have the ginning mill gin it on their behalf. If this is not possible, or if the ginning mill is unable to gin all of it, help them to gin it centrally, strictly ensuring purity preservation. Eighth, to facilitate the cotton farmers' payment of public cotton, the method of using the quality cotton procured from them to buy and pay for ordinary cotton can be used.

　　保证明年有效淘汰劣种棉
    集中掌握斯字棉纯种
    河北省府发布良棉收购保纯指示
    【保定电】河北省人民政府为了保持“斯字棉”纯种，特于日前发出“关于良棉收购保纯”的指示。指示指出：今年集中收购良种棉花（指导区所推广的斯字棉）的主要目的，是为了保持良棉纯种，以期在五年内达到普遍淘汰土棉劣种棉，使河北棉作完全变为良种，以增加产量，提高质量。因此，今年良棉收购保纯的主要关键，就是首先要做到把今年的良棉完全集中掌握。因此各级政府对这一艰巨任务，要十分重视，结合良棉指导区，教育农民，认真开展选种工作，并作到棉花分收、分轧、种籽分存。良棉收购工作要密切结合与依靠区村合作社，合作社通过收花业务，逐渐向健全的供销社发展。各良棉指导区轧花厂根据情况，将收花任务委托区社或村社办理，订立合同，供给收花基金，建立收花的正当业务关系；并在收购良棉期间，对委托之合作社负技术指导之责，给合作社收花的手续费。这样既能保障任务，又能通过收花业务开展合作社事业，为今后供销业务打下基础。合作社在替指导区轧花厂收购棉花时要注意以下几点：第一，我们的目的是要把良棉种籽集中掌握，不误明春推广，这一点必须抓紧，不能动摇。这就只有依靠组织教育工作来保证；并认真掌握卖花时间的自由，对现卖或存社丝毫不能强迫，以免棉农增加顾虑。第二，根据棉花需要，可以实物收购。合作社并可通过实物倒换开展供销业务。第三，认真识别棉花品种与等级。为使村社掌握这一技术，防止纠纷，保证质量，可根据各村棉花收获情形，固定收花日期，指导区轧花厂及县社等技术干部，按期去协助，并随时教育群众不掺杂花。第四，为保证棉籽成实，发芽良好，只收购前花。第五，群众愿自用穰花，可用轧手工的办法把穰花退回；但可教育群众，良棉价贵，不如卖了良花买普通棉便宜。第六，为贯彻良棉高价收买的政策，收花价格由轧花厂按公司定价随时通知合作社。合作社只能接受轧花厂给的手续费，作为经营的利润，不能在收花价格上自行涨落。要保证棉农的实得价格。第七，如果群众欲自行组织轧花，要动员教育说明公家收购是为集中种籽保持纯度，最好由轧花厂轧。至于群众留种籽用的棉花，也要争取轧花厂代轧，不能时，或轧花厂无力全轧时，即帮助他们集中轧，严格做到保纯。第八，为照顾棉花缴公棉的方便，可用收他的良棉花代买代缴普通花的办法。
