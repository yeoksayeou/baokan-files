Soviet Cultural Construction
Fadeyev's Speech at Peking University

Dear friends, on behalf of Soviet cultural workers, I extend brotherly greetings to you and congratulate you on the victory of the People's Republic of China, which opens up unlimited avenues for the Chinese people to develop their national culture.

You have asked me to talk about the nature of Soviet cultural construction. However, due to time constraints, I can only discuss its most important characteristics.

The first characteristic of Soviet culture is that it belongs to the people. Its significance lies in its gradual and extensive absorption of the vast millions of the Soviet Union's various nationalities. Its significance lies in the fact that it is created by the people themselves.

The foundation of our cultural development is universal primary education, that is, primary education for all children. And from this year, we have begun to implement a universal seven-year education system, meaning that every Soviet child should pass through the seventh grade before obtaining a vocation.

In addition to this, on the one hand, there are extensive pre-school educational facilities such as children's palaces and kindergartens, and on the other hand, higher education is gradually expanding, from universities to specialized schools for technology, medicine, education, and so on.

There are also numerous workers' clubs, clubs attached to various institutions, and tens of thousands of reading rooms in the countryside, with even the smallest enterprises and institutions having red corner clubs.

This year, our country's cultural expenditure is 61 billion rubles.

This is the nationwide foundation of Soviet education. On this foundation grow the highest fruits of culture—science, art, and literature. It is no wonder that, based on universal access to education, the Soviet Union has tens of thousands of scholars and thousands of writers. And every city in the country has theaters, as well as mobile theaters that tour the countryside.

The second characteristic of Soviet culture is its multi-ethnic nature. Even those small ethnic groups that were particularly oppressed by the Tsarist government and previously had no written language, after the Great October Socialist Revolution, gained their own writing systems, are taught in their native languages in schools, and are now on par with the most advanced ethnic groups in the Soviet Union. As the great Stalin pointed out, the path of development of the Soviet Union's great multi-ethnic culture—a culture that is socialist in content and national in form—is, without a doubt, far superior to the path of development of capitalist culture. Capitalism strives to keep oppressed nations ignorant, restricts and hinders the development of their cultures, and seeks to impoverish the entire treasure trove of human culture through this method. Socialism, on the other hand, assists in the development of the national characteristics of every nation's culture, thereby enriching the entire human culture.

Now, take the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic as an example. It is one of the Soviet Union's constituent republics, bordering China. Before the revolution, only a very small number of people in Kazakhstan were literate. Now, Kazakhstan is not only a country with universal literacy, but it also has its own Academy of Sciences, and there are opera houses and theaters not only in the republic's capital, Almaty, but also in the provincial centers. Kazakh literature is famous throughout the Soviet Union. The Kazakh writer Mukhtar Auezov's novel "Abai," a work commemorating the great classic writer and people's singer of the Kazakh people, received the All-Union Stalin Prize.

Examples of such cultural development can also be found in the lives of other smaller Soviet nationalities—the Bashkirs, Mordovians, Mari, Oirot, etc., nationalities so small that you may not even know their names. The great Soviet Union is able to unite more than sixty nationalities, large and small, in fraternal friendship. And each of these nationalities can make its contribution to the overall cultural development of the Soviet Union.

The third characteristic of Soviet cultural development is that it inherits, continues, and develops on a new basis all the best and most progressive aspects of the old national cultures and world culture. We proceed from Lenin's principle that there have always been two cultures in every nation: one is the false culture, which often has temporary, accidental, and easily disappearing characteristics of the exploiting classes who create this culture; the other is the true culture, which, although often created by people from the exploiting classes, grows out of large-scale people's movements, utilizes the precious creations of the people, and harbors a great humanitarian purpose. It is precisely this true culture that Soviet culture inherits. We carefully hold all the best things of the past in our hands as masters, making them the wealth of the people. We rely on this treasure trove of past cultures to build the culture of the new society.

The fourth characteristic of Soviet culture is that it is deeply patriotic and possesses a sense of national self-esteem. Its patriotism has nothing in common with those false patriotisms, which should more correctly be called chauvinism, which even try to impose all the backward aspects of their own culture on other nations, because they do not respect and despise other nations and pursue material interests. Our patriotism is true patriotism, progressive patriotism, which stems from the highest aspirations of mankind: the desire to share with other nations the most progressive and excellent achievements that people have created in their own cultural development.

Therefore, the national pride of Soviet people in their cultural development stems from the noble understanding that we are the first in the world to be able to eliminate the exploitation of man by man, eliminate national discrimination, implement universal education, and achieve equality between men and women. Soviet people feel that this is a more just system of life for mankind, and that other nations in the world will also move towards this system of life through their own paths. And this is the reason for the national pride of the Soviet people.

Finally, the fifth characteristic of Soviet culture is that it implements partisanship. Under the partisanship of our culture, we precisely understand that it consciously serves the people, serves their socialist country, and consciously puts forward the goal of educating the people in communism.

The great Lenin and Stalin instructed us that culture has never been and cannot be non-partisan. If one often thinks that literature is non-partisan, then this is only to hide one's own servility to the ruling class. Just as a person has loves and hates in life, the culture that people create also has its loves and hates. It supports something and opposes something else. Our culture supports the Soviet people and their world's first socialist country, and its goal is to educate the people in the spirit of communism. Since this is the case, then every day, every hour, we must expose the false culture of the imperialists to the people, expose the culture of enslaving nations, the culture of war, the culture of hating mankind. Therefore, the communist culture of the Soviet Union is developing under the banner of fighting against its enemies. The great Leninist-Stalinist Party, the Communist Party of Bolsheviks, which leads the entire process of building the new Soviet culture, guides the activities of Soviet cultural workers every day. The Party is most concerned that we can correctly see the road to communism, that we can expose the enemy's conspiracies and tricks in a timely manner, and that, in the daily struggle between the two cultures—the highly communist culture and the cannibalistic false culture of the imperialists—the Party educates us to maintain close ties with the cultural creators—the people—and to clearly realize the highly communist goals of cultural development. These are all important conditions that enable Soviet cultural workers to become the freest workers in the world. They are in no way related to the power of money, individual publishers, government officials, or big capitalist bosses. In this respect, they are spiritually superior to cultural workers in capitalist countries.

I now once again extend warm greetings to the great Chinese people and its cultural workers. We are confident that in another ten or twenty years, China will be completely renewed in terms of culture. The victory of the people's revolution will place the Chinese people among the world's most progressive nations that are showing the way for all mankind.

Long live the Chinese people, the People's Republic of China, and the new culture of the Chinese people!

Long live the Chinese intellectual youth and their future!

　　苏联文化建设
    法捷耶夫在北京大学的讲演词
    亲爱的朋友们，我代表苏联文化工作者向你们致兄弟的敬礼，并祝贺中华人民共和国的胜利，因为它给中国人们开辟了无限制地发扬民族文化的道路。
    大家要我来讲一讲苏联文化建设的性质。但是因为时间的限制，我只能谈谈它的最主要的几个特点。
    苏联文化的第一个特点就是它是属于人民的。它的意义就在于它逐渐广泛地吸收着苏维埃一切民族的最广大的千百万的群众。它的意义就在于它本身就是由人民创造的。
    我们文化发展的基础就是普遍初级教育，也就是所有儿童的初级教育。而从本年起我们已开始实行普通七年制教育，就是每一个苏联儿童都应当在获得职业以前，经过七年级的学校。
    除此以外，一方面有儿童宫及幼稚园等的广泛学校教育前的设施，另一方面高级学校又逐渐广泛地发展，由大学起到技术、医科、教育等专科学校止。
    更有许许多多工人俱乐部，各机关附设的俱乐部，乡村中成万的阅览室，即使在最小的企业与机关也有红色小型俱乐部。
    本年我们国家在文化上的支出有六百一十亿卢布。
    这就是苏联教育的全民的基础。在这个基础上生长起文化的最高果实——科学、艺术、文学。毫不足怪，在普通入学受教育的基础上，苏联有成万的学者，数千作家。而国家内每一个城市都有剧院，另外还有巡回于各乡村的活动剧院。
    苏联文化的第二个特点是它的多民族性。甚至于那些特别受沙皇政府压迫的以往没有自己文字的小民族，在伟大的十月社会主义革命以后，也有了他们的文字，学校中用本族文字教学，并且现在已经和苏联最前进的民族并列了。正如伟大的斯大林所指出的苏联的伟大的多民族的文化——社会主义的内容、民族形式的文化，不用说，这种文化发展的道路就是这样形成的，远超过资本主义文化发展的道路。资本主义努力使被压迫的民族愚昧无知，牵制和阻止他们文化的发展，而想着用这种方法来使人类整个文化的宝库日趋贫乏。而社会主义则协助每一民族的文化的一切民族特点的发展，而由此来丰富整个人类的文化。
    现在把喀萨克斯坦社会主义共和国作为例子来说，它是苏联的加盟共和国之一，接靠着中国。革命前喀萨克斯坦只有极少数的人识字，现在喀萨克斯坦则不仅是一个人民普遍识字的国家，在那里有自己的科学院，不但在共和国首都阿尔本图有歌剧院及剧院，而且在各省中心也有。喀萨克斯坦的文学是闻名于全苏联的。喀萨克斯坦的作家，穆何塔拉·阿马耶作夫的小说“阿别依”是一部纪念喀萨克斯坦人民的伟大古典作家及人民歌手的作品，得到全苏联斯大林奖金。
    这种文化发展的例子，也可以从其他较小的苏联民族——巴什基尔，莫尔多夫，马里也兹，奥依洛特等的生活中找出来，这些民族非常之小，恐怕你们可能连他们的名字都不知道。伟大的苏联能够在兄弟般友谊中团结六十个以上的大小民族。而其中每一个民族都能完成它对于苏联整个文化发展的供献。
    苏联文化发展的第三个特点，是它继承着延续着，并在新的基础上发展着，旧的民族文化和世界文化中一切最优良的前进的东西，我们由列宁的原则出发，就是在以往每个民族都有两种文化，一种是假的文化，经常有创造这种文化的，剥削阶级的临时的，偶然的，易于消失的特点，另一种是真正的文化，虽然往往也是由剥削阶级出身的人所创造，但是在大规模的人民运动中长成的，利用了人民宝贵的创造，抱有一种大的人道主义的目的，苏维埃文化就正是继承着这种真正的文化。所有以往的最好的东西，我们都以主人翁的地位，小心地拿在自己的手里，作成人民的财富，我们就依靠以往文化的这种宝藏来建设新社会的文化。
    苏联文化的第四个特点，是它深切地富有爱国主义，富有民族自尊的感觉，它的这种爱国主义与那些假的爱国主义没有丝毫相同之点的，后者更正确地应当叫作沙文主义，这种沙文主义甚至想把自己文化中的一切落后的东西，强加到其他民族的身上，这是因为他不尊重和蔑视其他民族，和追求物质的利益，我们的爱国主义是真正的爱国主义，是进步的爱国主义，它由人类最崇高的愿望出发的，这种愿望就是要和其他民族共享人民在自己文化发展上，所创造的最进步的和最优秀的成果。
    因此，苏维埃人们在他们文化发展方面的民族骄傲，是从这样一种高尚认识出发的，就是我们在世界上是首先能够消灭人对人的剥削，消灭民族歧视，实行普及教育，男女平等的国家，苏维埃人们感到，这是人类生活中更为公平的制度，世界上其他民族也会经由自己的途径走向这种生活制度，而这个也就是苏联人民民族骄傲的原因。
    最后，苏联文化的第五个特点是它贯彻了党性，在我们文化的党性之下，我们恰恰体会到，它是自觉地为人民服务，为他们的社会主义国家服务，并且自觉地提出共产主义教育人民的目标。
    伟大的列宁与斯大林指示我们，文化从来不是而且也不可能是无党性的，如果常认为文学无党性，那末这不过是为了掩饰自己对于统治阶级的奴性，这正如一个人在生活中有爱恶，人们所创造出的文化也有它的爱恶，它拥护某一种东西，而又反对另外一种东西，我们的文化拥护苏维埃人民和它的世界上第一个社会主义的国家，它的目的是以共产主义的精神，来教育人民，既然是这样，那末就要日日地，时时地，在人民面前，来揭发帝国主义者的假文化，揭发奴役各民族的文化，战争的文化，憎恶人类的文化，所以苏联的共产主义的文化，就是在这和它的敌人作斗争的旗帜下，来发展着的，领导苏联新文化建设全部过程的伟大的列宁斯大林的党共产党——布尔塞维克党，每天都在指导着苏维埃文化工作者的活动，党最关心的是我们能够正确地看到走向共产主义的道路，能够适时揭发敌人的阴谋和诡计，在两种文化——共产主义高度的文化和吃人的帝国主义者的假文化——的每天的斗争中，党教育着我们和文化创造者——人民的密切联系，并明显地觉悟到文化发展的高度共产主义的目的，这都是苏维埃文化工作者，所以能成为世界上最自由的工作者的重要条件，他们是和金钱势力，个别出版家，政府官吏，大的资本家老板是毫不相关的，在这一点上，就是他们在精神上优越于资本主义国家文化工作者的。
    我现在再向伟大的中国人民，和它的文化工作者，热烈的致敬礼，我们确信，再过十年二十年中国在文化方面，将要焕然一新，人民革命的胜利，将使中国人民，列入指示全人类道路的世界最进步的民族之中。
    中国人民，中华人民共和国，中国人民新文化万岁！
    中国知识青年和他们的前途万岁！
