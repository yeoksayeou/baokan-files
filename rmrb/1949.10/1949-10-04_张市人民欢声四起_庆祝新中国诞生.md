　　Zhangjiakou People Cheer and Celebrate the Birth of New China
    [Our Correspondent, Zhangjiakou, 2nd] A grand gathering of 50,000 people in Zhangjiakou warmly celebrated the establishment of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China. The rally was held at Victory Square at 9:00 am. The magnificent ranks of party, government, military, civilian organizations, and schools from all over the city poured into the venue. Each row was preceded by dozens of red flags shining with portraits of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, Chairman Mao, and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. Military music, drums, slogans, songs, and firecrackers reverberated throughout this famous city north of the Great Wall. The conference began amidst dozens of artillery salutes and the sounds of the national anthem and military music. People watched with utmost reverence and excitement as the national flag of the People's Republic of China, the symbol of the great unity of the Chinese people, slowly rose into the sky. The presidium read out the announcement of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and the orders of Commander-in-Chief Zhu. When it was read that "Mao Zedong is appointed Chairman of the Central People's Revolutionary Military Commission" and "Zhu De is appointed Commander-in-Chief of the People's Liberation Army," 50,000 fists were raised in unison, shouting Long Live Chairman Mao, Long Live Commander-in-Chief Zhu. Finally, the conference unanimously adopted a congratulatory telegram to the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao. At 6:00 pm that day, a torchlight demonstration parade of more than 50,000 people was also held for the "International Day for Peace and Struggle."
