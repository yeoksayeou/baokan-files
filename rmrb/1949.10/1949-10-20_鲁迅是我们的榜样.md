　　Lu Xun is Our Example
    Chen Boda
    【Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 19th】"Lu Xun is our example" - Vice Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Chen Boda, made the following speech at the memorial meeting for the 13th anniversary of Lu Xun's death held by people from all walks of life in the capital:
    Our friends Fadeyev and Simonov came to China this time and gave us many good speeches. Comrade Fadeyev said the following:
    "If a person is loyal to his nation, if he loves her, then his greatest happiness is to dedicate his whole heart to her and raise her to the highest peak of human culture."
    This piece of advice is very good.
    Today we are here to commemorate Lu Xun. I think Lu Xun belongs to such a great person. Lu Xun loved China and dedicated his whole heart to the Chinese people, serving the Chinese people, doing his best, and dying only after he had exhausted his efforts. Lu Xun's works are the essence of modern Chinese culture, or rather, the most important part of the essence of modern Chinese culture. His achievements in the combination of thought and art have raised our Chinese culture a step further. But he was never satisfied with himself. He worked hard and tried to do his work better, hoping that China could quickly catch up with the highest peak of human culture. This great prophet understood that the representative of the highest peak of human culture is Soviet culture. He tirelessly introduced the Soviet Union in order to make us learn from the Soviet Union, and he recognized that Soviet culture is the goal we pursue and emulate. Lu Xun had no illusions. He knew that we must go through the victory of the people's revolution to pursue such a goal. Now the victory of the people's revolution is opening up a great path of such possibility for us. Unfortunately, Lu Xun died early. We must now, under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, take up the burden left by Lu Xun. How can we turn Lu Xun's hope into reality and turn the possibility of the Chinese people catching up with the highest peak of human culture into reality? We must dedicate our whole heart to the people like Lu Xun; we must be down-to-earth and work conscientiously like Lu Xun; we must do whatever should be done and must be done quickly, like Lu Xun, and not let time pass in vain, leaving regrets; we must not be satisfied with one success, but strive for further progress like Lu Xun; we must use Lu Xun's spirit of fighting the enemy to the end to overcome all the difficulties we encounter in our work; we must use Lu Xun's spirit of pursuing the truth to learn from the Soviet Union.
    I believe that under the education of Comrade Mao Zedong, countless Lu Xuns will emerge, combining the economic construction and cultural construction of the new China, and fully realize Comrade Mao Zedong's prediction that "we will appear in the world as a nation with a high degree of culture."
    Lu Xun is our example!
    Eternal glory to Lu Xun who served the people!

　　鲁迅是我们的榜样
    陈伯达
    【新华社北京十九日电】“鲁迅是我们的榜样”——中共中央宣传部副部长陈伯达在首都各界人民纪念鲁迅逝世十三周年大会上的演说，文如下：
    这回我们的友人法捷耶夫、西蒙诺夫诸同志来到我们中国，给我们作了许多很好的演说，其中法捷耶夫同志说过以下一段话：
    “如果一个人忠实于自己的民族，如果他热爱她，那他最大的幸福，就是把他整个的心奉献给她，把她提高到全人类文化的最高峰。”
    这一段赠言是很好的。
    今天我们在这里纪念鲁迅，我想鲁迅就是属于这末一个伟大的人物。鲁迅热爱中国，把他整个的心奉献给中国人民，为中国人民服务，鞠躬尽瘁，死而后已。鲁迅的著作是近代中国文化的精华，或者说，是近代中国文化的精华的最重大的一部分。他在思想上与艺术上互相结合的成就，把我们中国文化提高了一步。但他从来没有自己满足过，他努力又努力，希望自己的工作能够做得更好，希望中国能够很快地追上全人类文化的最高峰。这位伟大的先知者了解全人类文化最高峰的代表便是苏联文化。他不疲乏地介绍苏联，就是为的要我们向苏联学习，就是认定苏联文化乃是我们追求和看齐的目标。鲁迅没有空想，他知道我们要追求这样的目标，必须经过人民革命的胜利。现在人民革命的胜利，正给我们开辟了这种可能性的伟大道路。可惜鲁迅是早逝世了。我们现在要在毛泽东主席的领导下，挑起鲁迅所留下的这一个担子。我们如何能够把鲁迅的希望变成实际，把中国人民追上全人类文化最高峰的可能性变成现实性呢？我们就必要象鲁迅一样，把我们整个的心奉献给人民；就必要象鲁迅一样，脚踏实地，认真工作；就必要象鲁迅一样，对于凡是应该做的，要做的，就赶快做，不要让时间空空过去，剩下后悔；就必要象鲁迅一样，不要以一得自满，要进一步又求再进一步；就必要用鲁迅和敌人作战到底的精神，去战胜我们在工作上所遇到的一切困难；就必要用鲁迅追求真理的精神，去学习苏联。
    我相信：我们在毛泽东同志的教育之下，必将出现无数的鲁迅，结合着新中国的经济建设和文化建设，而完全实现毛泽东同志关于“我们将以一个具有高度文化的民族出现于世界”的预告。
    鲁迅是我们的榜样！
    为人民服务的鲁迅永垂不朽！
