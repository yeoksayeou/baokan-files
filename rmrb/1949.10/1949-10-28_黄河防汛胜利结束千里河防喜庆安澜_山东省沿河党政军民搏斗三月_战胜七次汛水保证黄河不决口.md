　　Shandong Province's Party, Government, Military, and People Along the River Fight for Three Months
　　Overcome Seven Flood Peaks, Guaranteeing the Yellow River Will Not Breach

　　[Shandong News] As the Frost's Descent (Shuangjiang) arrives, the river water returns to its channel, marking the victorious end of the Yellow River flood control and celebrating peace and tranquility along thousands of miles of river defense. The 24th of this month, according to the lunar calendar, is the traditional Chinese River Peace Festival. At 6:00 AM on the 23rd, the water level at Luokou dropped to 29.35 meters, indicating that the river water had officially returned to its channel. The Flood Control Headquarters notified that, except for the two dangerous sections at Qianzuo in Kenli and Chaoyangzhuang in Jiyang, which would retain some forces to continue completing the repair work, all other areas would be completely evacuated today. The arduous struggle of the Party, government, military, people, and all river defense personnel for more than three months has come to an end. This year's Yellow River flood season began on July 6th and lasted for 109 days, experiencing a total of seven flood peaks. The secondary flood peak at the end of July was relatively severe. At 24:00 on July 30th, the water level at Luokou rose to 30.76 meters, the highest peak of this year's mid-season flood, and all projects safely weathered it. The autumn flood situation was extremely dangerous, with five, six, and seven floods occurring continuously. The fifth flood was the most severe. At 17:00 on September 22nd, the water level at Luokou rose to 32.33 meters, exceeding the highest flood level of 1937 by 0.21 meters, creating the highest flood record for the Yellow River in Shandong. This year, not only was the water level high, but the duration of the flood was also extraordinarily long. In total, the water level at Luokou remained above 30 meters for 62 days and above the flood level of 31 meters for as long as 29 days. Almost the entire embankment was exposed to the water, and with the full support of the Party, government, military, and people, a comprehensive, sustained, intense, and tense rescue operation was launched along thousands of miles of river defense. More than 210,000 workers, farmers, troops, students, and cadres at all levels formed a living embankment, guarding day and night, fighting tenaciously, and finally overcame the serious dangers at Huiji Gujia, Zhang Xinzhuang, Kenli Qianzuo, Putai Mawan, and Lijin Wangjiazhuang. They plugged every leak on the embankment, firmly defended the thousands of miles of embankment, and earnestly implemented the call of the Party and the government: "Guarantee the Yellow River will not breach!" They created a new miracle in the struggle against the Yellow River. Now, after the evacuation, the Party, government, military, people, and all employees of the river defense will use a spirit of not being arrogant or impetuous, being modest and cautious, to summarize the experience of this victorious struggle and carry forward the spirit of heroic struggle, in order to create greater and newer miracles in the future struggle against the Yellow River.

    【山东讯】霜降来临，河水归槽，黄河防汛胜利结束，千里河防喜庆安澜。本月二十四日为夏历霜降，是中国历代相传的河防安澜节。二十三日晨六时，泺口水位降至二九·三五公尺，表明河水已经正式归槽，防总通知除垦利前左及济阳朝阳庄两处险工仍留一部力量继续完成修工任务外，其余各地于今日全部撤防。党政军民与全体河防员工三月余的艰辛苦斗至此结束。按今年黄河汛期自七月六日即开始，至今已持续一○九天，共经历七次汛水。伏汛以七月底的第二次汛水较严重，七月三十日二十四时泺口水位涨达三○·七六公尺，为今年伏汛的最高峰，各工平稳安渡。秋汛形势极为凶险，连续发生五、六、七等三次洪水，以五次洪水最严重，九月二十二日十七时泺口水位涨达三二·三三公尺，超过一九三七年最高洪水○·二一公尺，造成山东黄河的最高洪水纪录。今年不但水位高，而且洪水持续时间也超乎寻常。总计泺口保持在三○公尺以上高水位，达六十二天，保持在三一公尺以上的洪水位，也达二十九天之久。大堤几乎全部临水，在党政军民的全力支持下，千里河防展开了全面、持久、激烈、紧张的抢护运动。二十一万余工人、农民、部队、学生及各级干部组成了活的大堤，日夜守护，顽强搏斗，终于克服了惠济谷家、张辛庄，垦利前左，蒲台麻湾及利津王家庄等险工的严重险象，抢堵了大堤上的每个漏病，坚守千里大堤，切实执行了党和政府的号召：“保证黄河不决口！”创造了与黄河斗争的新的奇迹。现各河防党政军民与全体员工于撤防后，将以不骄不躁、虚心谨慎的精神，总结这次胜利斗争的经验，发扬这次英勇苦斗的精神，以便在今后与黄水斗争中创造更大更新的奇迹。
