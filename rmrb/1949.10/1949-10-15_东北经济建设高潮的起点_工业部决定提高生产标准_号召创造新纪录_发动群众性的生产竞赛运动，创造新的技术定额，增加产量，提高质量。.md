Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 14th - The Northeast People's Government's Ministry of Industry recently issued the "Decision on Launching a Mass Movement to Create New Production Records," the full text of which is as follows:

(1) Zhao Guoyou, a worker at the Machinery Bureau, created a new record by completing the cutting of a turret wheel in two hours and thirty minutes. Dang Huian and Zhao Fuyou created new records by completing the cutting of lead screws in two hours and thirty-seven minutes and three hours and nine minutes, respectively. The work efficiency was five times higher than the original estimate for the former and ten to twelve times higher for the latter. Zhang Shangju's layout group set a new record for layout on a six-foot lathe, reducing the time from 178 hours in April to the current 11 and a half hours, increasing efficiency by fifteen times. This is a matter of great political significance in Northeast industrial construction. It has profound revolutionary significance, breaking the existing quotas, creating new production quotas, and greatly breaking the puppet Manchukuo quotas. They are models for improving labor productivity. The reason they were able to create new records is: there is no exploitation in state-owned enterprises now, and they are working for their own class. Therefore, the attitude towards labor has fundamentally changed, and labor is an honor. They are working with creative labor, skillfully mastering technology, paying attention to improving tools, and improving operating methods, in order to enhance the heroic spirit of the working class, thus greatly improving labor productivity.

	  It is necessary to break the old "technical viewpoints" and technical quotas to promote new and higher technical quotas and production standards

(2) Based on the new records created by Zhang Shangju, Zhao Guoyou, Dang Huian, Zhao Fuyou, Chen Jimin, and the experience of other factories, we must fully summarize advanced experience when formulating various technical quotas. The view that the "puppet Manchukuo standard" is the highest "technical quota" is completely wrong. Because colonial production relations cannot have higher productivity, whether in the use of production equipment or in labor productivity. It is necessary to break the old "technical viewpoints" and the old technical quotas; we must liberate ourselves from the so-called "puppet Manchukuo standard" so that we can promote new and higher technical quotas and new and higher production standards. Zhang Shangju, Zhao Guoyou, etc., are precisely such representatives. They broke the old records and created new records.

(3) At present, the most important aspect of business management in the industrial sector is to implement economic accounting. We require more products, better quality, faster capital turnover, and lower costs. We demand to break the status quo, and we demand to create all kinds of new records. We want new records for high production efficiency, new records for good product quality, new records for reducing defective products, new records for saving raw materials, new records for increasing recovery rates, new records for increasing the safe operation rate of equipment, new records for reducing and eliminating various accidents, new records for reducing costs, and new records for improving management systems (such as inspection systems, statistical work, etc.). We want all kinds of new records. Through the creation of new records, a mass movement is launched to formulate various quotas from the bottom up, so as to lay a preliminary foundation for our economic accounting system.

All factories and mines under the Ministry of Industry should, without exception, learn from the recent instructions of the Ministry of Industry and the experience of the Machinery Bureau based on the specific environment of each factory and mine, and launch a movement to create new records. Because there are advanced elements working in every factory and mine, the problem lies in whether our leading cadres go deep into the factories and mines to discover them, commend them, and organize them. In production, the broad masses of workers are organized around advanced elements, and the general workers are led by advanced elements, so that the mass competition movement enters a new stage, and strive to create new technical quotas, increase production, improve quality, and reduce costs. In the creation of new records, attention must be paid to preventing possible deviations, such as only paying attention to the new records of a few advanced elements, but not organizing the creation of mass new records, or only paying attention to quantity, regardless of quality, or only paying attention to efficiency, but not paying attention to the safety of the machine.

(4) Comrades Zhang Shangju, Zhao Guoyou, Dang Huian, Zhao Fuyou, Chen Jimin, etc., workers of the Machinery Bureau, created new records in working hours in machinery manufacturing. For this, the Ministry of Industry specially gave them material rewards and presented them with flags and medals for the movement to create new records.

In the future, workers, technicians, and management personnel of various factories and mines who create new records, or make improvements and innovations in production work, should be given material rewards. The general bonus is currently tentatively set at 2% to 3% of the salary. If there is a major innovation, the facts should be explained and reported to the Ministry of Industry for an award. Each unit should study the piece-rate wage system and at the same time implement the excess reward system in the creation of new records.

　　东北经济建设高潮的起点
    工业部决定提高生产标准
    号召创造新纪录
    发动群众性的生产竞赛运动，创造新的技术定额，增加产量，提高质量。
    【新华社沈阳十四日电】东北人民政府工业部最近发布“关于开展群众性创造生产新纪录的决定”，全文如下：
    （一）机械局工人赵国有创造了切削塔轮于二点三十分完工的新纪录。党会安、赵富有创造了切削丝杠于二点三十七分与三点零九分完工的新纪录。工作效率较之原来的估工，前者提高了五倍，后者提高了十倍到十二倍。张尚举划线组六尺车床划线，由四月份的一七八小时减到现在的一一小时半的新纪录，效率提高了十五倍。这是东北工业建设中有重大政治意义的事情，它具有深刻的革命性，打破了现行的定额，创造了新的生产定额，大大地打破了伪满的定额。他们是提高劳动生产率的模范。他们所以能创造新的纪录，原因是：现在公营企业里已没有剥削现象了，他们是为了自己阶级而工作的。因此，劳动态度根本改变了，劳动是荣誉的。他们是以创造性劳动，熟习地掌握技术，注意改良工具，改善操作方法，以提高工人阶级的英雄气概来进行工作的，因此大大提高了劳动生产率。
    　　　　必须打破陈旧的“技术观点”与技术定额推动新的更高的技术定额与生产标准
    （二）根据张尚举、赵国有、党会安、赵富有、陈济民创造的新纪录，以及其他工厂的经验，我们在制定各种技术定额时，必须充分总结先进的经验。那种以“伪满标准”为最高的“技术定额”的观点，完全是错误的。因为殖民地的生产关系，是不可能有更高的生产力的，不论在生产设备的运用上与劳动生产率上都是如此。必须打破陈旧的“技术观点”与陈旧的技术定额；必须从所谓“伪满标准”解放出来，我们才能推动新的更高的技术定额，新的更高的生产标准。张尚举、赵国有等正是这种代表人物，他们突破了旧纪录创造了新纪录。
    （三）目前工业部门经营管理最重要的一环是实行经济核算，我们要求产品多，质量好，资金周转快，成本低。我们要求突破现状，我们要求创造各式各样的新纪录。我们要生产效率高的新纪录，要产品质量好的新纪录，要减少废品的新纪录，要节省原料的新纪录，要提高回收率的新纪录，要提高设备安全运用率的新纪录，要降低与消灭各种事故的新纪录，要降低成本的新纪录，要改善管理制度的新纪录（如检查制度、统计工作等），我们要各式各样的新纪录。经过创造新纪录发动群众性自下而上制定各种定额，以便把我们经济核算制打下初步基础。
    工业部所属各个厂矿，都应毫无例外地根据各个厂矿的具体环境，学习工业部最近的指示与机械局的经验，开展创造新纪录运动。因为各个厂矿都有先进分子在工作着，问题在我们领导干部要深入厂矿去发现他们，去表扬他们，去组织他们。在生产中把广大的工人群众组织在先进分子的周围，经过先进分子把一般工人带动起来，使群众性的竞赛运动进入新阶段，为创造新的技术定额，为增加产量，提高质量，降低成本而斗争。在创造新纪录中，必须注意防止可能的偏向，如只注意少数先进分子新纪录，而不去组织创造群众性的新纪录，或者只管数量，不管质量，或者只管效率，而不注意机器的安全。
    （四）机械局工人张尚举、赵国有、党会安、赵富有、陈济民等同志，在机械制造中创造了工作时间上的新纪录，为此工业部特别给他们以物质奖励，并送给他们创造新纪录运动的旗子与奖章。
    今后各个厂矿的工人与技术人员与管理人员，凡创造新纪录，或者在生产工作上有所改进与创造者皆应给予物质奖励。一般奖励金，目前暂定为工资百分之二至百分之三，如有重大创造者应说明事实报告工业部，由工业部给奖。各单位应在创造新纪录当中，研究计件工资制，同时试行超额奖励制度。
