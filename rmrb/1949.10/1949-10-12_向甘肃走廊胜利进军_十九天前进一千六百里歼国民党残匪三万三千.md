Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 9th: A front-line reporter reports on the People's Liberation Army's advance into the Gansu Corridor and the liberation of Gansu Province, stating: The First Field Army of the People's Liberation Army, disregarding the fatigue of continuous marching and combat, overcame various difficulties, and after liberating Lanzhou and Xining, continued to advance towards the Hexi Corridor in Gansu. From Lanzhou and Xining, via Zhangye, to Anxi, the apex of the Hexi Corridor, they advanced 1,500 to 1,600 li in nineteen days, finally annihilating more than 33,000 Kuomintang remnant bandits remaining in Gansu Province. The first operational goal of the People's Liberation Army was to capture Zhangye, a key city connecting Gansu to Xinjiang, and annihilate the 120th Army of Zhou Jiabin and the 91st Army Corps of Huang Zuxun, Kuomintang remnant bandits in Gansu, in the area east of Zhangye, and then advance victoriously to the west. The People's Liberation Army advanced along the Gan (Su) Xin (jiang) and Qing (hai) Gan (su) highways in two routes, left and right, according to the pre-determined combat plan.

　　　　The Right Route: Crossing Snow Mountains and Grasslands, Advancing Rapidly Northwest
    The right route army set off from the northwest area of Xining on September 10th. After successively capturing the two county towns of Datong and @yuan on the 12th, they continued to advance rapidly to the northwest. Northwest of @yuan are the Qilian Mountains, 5,900 meters above sea level, and a vast grassland of over 220 li with no inhabitants. The People's Liberation Army, marching continuously for twenty-eight hours, braving rain, snow, severe cold, crossed the snow-capped mountains and grasslands, and rapidly arrived at the city of Minle, southeast of the border between Gansu and Qinghai, before dawn on the 17th. After an hour of battle, they captured Minle City, annihilating the Fifteenth Cavalry Brigade headquarters and all of the Thirty-second Cavalry Regiment of the bandit cavalry in one fell swoop. On the morning of the same day, the Northwest Military and Political Office of the bandits transported its guard regiment from Zhangye to reinforce, attempting to stop the People's Liberation Army from advancing. The People's Liberation Army encountered the enemy at Thirty Li Pu, northwest of Minle, at 9:00 a.m. on the 18th and immediately defeated them, and then pursued them to Liuba, where they defeated the 735th Regiment of the 245th Division of Zhou Jiabin's bandits, capturing over 300 bandits including the bandit regiment commander Tang Zhixian, and killing and wounding over 200 bandits. In order to seize a favorable opportunity to capture Zhangye and cut off the escape route of the Zhou and Huang bandits, the vanguard of the People's Liberation Army set off from Liuba at 5:00 a.m. on the 19th, passed through 60 li of desert, and launched an encirclement and attack on Zhangye. In a battle lasting only nineteen minutes, they completely annihilated the 733rd and 734th entire regiments of Zhou's 245th Division, and liberated Zhangye. The People's Liberation Army suffered no casualties. After the liberation of Zhangye, the People's Liberation Army advanced westward overnight, forcing the remnants of Zhou's 173rd Division cavalry regiment and Huang's 91st Army 246th Division 736th Regiment, which had fled west of Zhangye, to lay down their weapons and surrender to us on the 20th.

　　　　The Left Route: Mechanized Units Pursue the Victory; Remnant Bandits Surrender in Large Numbers Due to Overwhelming Power
    As soon as the left route of the People's Liberation Army set out, the cavalry regiment of Huang's 191st Division, with about 800 men and horses each, who had fled to the area north of Yongdeng, immediately staged an uprising on the battlefield under the leadership of Regiment Commander Qu Yi. On the 13th, the People's Liberation Army liberated the city of Gulang. The People's Liberation Army then advanced victoriously, liberating Wuwei, the first important county town in the Hexi Corridor, on the afternoon of the 16th. The direct cavalry regiment of Huang's 91st Army, with about 700 men and horses each, and the cavalry regiment of Huang's 246th Division, with over 1,000 men, surrendered at the same time. Under the awe-inspiring power of our army, the pseudo-Gansu Security Third Regiment, Fourth Regiment, and Wuwei pseudo-Self-Defense Regiment, Self-Defense Team, etc., totaling 5,800 people and over 1,500 horses, surrendered to the People's Liberation Army on the 17th, and quickly organized cavalry units to cooperate with armored rapid units to pursue and advance towards Zhangye. On the 19th, 20th, and 21st, the vanguard of the People's Liberation Army successively captured the cities of Yongchang and Shandan. A unit also moved north and liberated Minqin on the 22nd, clearing out the remnant bandits on the flanks, and the rapid forces.

　　　　The Two Routes Meet: Continuing Westward, Capturing Five Cities in Succession, 20,000 Enemy Surrender; Under the Influence of Victory, the Xinjiang Issue is Resolved Peacefully
    On the 22nd, the left route of the People's Liberation Army advanced to Zhangye and victoriously met with the right route of the army, and continued to advance rapidly, capturing the five county towns of Linze, Gaotai, Jiuquan, Yumen, and Anxi in succession in the week up to the 28th. Along the way, more than 20,000 remnant bandits surrendered one after another. Under the influence of the great victory of the People's Liberation Army, within three days, on the 24th, 25th, and 26th, the Kuomintang army in Xinjiang and the Kuomintang provincial government issued telegrams, expressing their willingness to accept Chairman Mao's eight peace terms and peacefully resolve the Xinjiang issue. The People's Liberation Army, which has advanced to the gateway of Xinjiang, is about to begin stationing in Xinjiang.
