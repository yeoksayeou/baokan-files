　　The Cultivation of Propaganda Cadres
    Our country is confidently walking on a new and great path of ascent, vigorously developing industry, agriculture, culture, and art. Ideological work has reached an even larger scale. In this academic year, the political education of party members and probationary party members has achieved significant improvements.

    Now, the past learning summaries of political schools and groups, and the collective theoretical discussions held by people who independently study Marxism-Leninism, show that the theoretical level of Communist Party members has improved, and knowledge is more extensive and consolidated.

    The Party always considers a high level of ideological understanding in Marxist-Leninist propaganda to be of utmost importance. Lenin and Stalin repeatedly emphasized the high responsibility of propagandists, believing that the work of propagandists should only be entrusted to qualified people who are guaranteed to possess sufficient knowledge to educate our Bolshevik cadres.

    In the process of leading the great work of socialist construction, the Party has cultivated millions of propagandists. They are active guides of Bolshevik ideology among the workers and are militant cultivators who equip cadres with Marxist-Leninist thought.

    The replenishment of the ranks of propagandists with the strength of youth is constantly underway. The improvement of propaganda cadres in the Party's education is one of the most satisfying aspects of the academic year's summary. Approximately half of the propagandists have received higher education or are studying at universities. A large number of Party, Soviet, and economic activists are leading seminars, groups, and political schools. Therefore, in recent times, the propagandist ranks have been filled with some of the most politically experienced and cultivated Communist Party members. This proves that local Party organizations correctly understand their main task in the Party's education sector and regard the constant improvement of propaganda cadres as their important work.

    However, it cannot be said that all propagandists are already able to meet the highest demands placed on them with their knowledge and experience. At the beginning of this year, the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) instructed the Yaroslavl Party organization that the main problem it still needs to solve is to ensure that all groups and schools have highly accomplished propagandists. This instruction is not only directly related to the Yaroslavl Party, but also has the same significance for many other Party organizations.

    In some places, formalism and scholasticism in learning have not been eliminated to this day. Lively discussions are often replaced by the method of explaining topics. This inevitably leads to mechanically memorizing individual facts and circumstances, promoting rote learning instead of creatively discussing and understanding the learning materials. The same shortcomings exist in teaching revolutionary theory: insufficient attention is paid to the selection and education of propaganda cadres, nor is assistance provided.

    That is why, in the preparation for the new academic year, primary attention must be given to the further improvement and cultivation of propaganda cadres. At no time can it be forgotten that the propagandist is the basic figure in the Party's education.

    The decision passed by the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) a few days ago to organize training classes for leaders of political schools and groups in the summer of 1949 to study the biographies of Lenin and Stalin and the history of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) is another manifestation of the Party's concern for raising the ideological and theoretical level and systematic knowledge of propagandists. The Party's municipal committees organized three-month training classes for urban propagandists. Their studies will not be separated from their work. Provincial Party committees, border region Party committees, and the Party Central Committees of the Union Republics all organized one-month training classes for rural propagandists, who will temporarily leave their main work during their studies.

    The study plan for the training classes, in addition to the general theoretical program, also stipulated the topics for lectures and discussions. For rural propagandists, the same plan includes reading a series of lectures and reports on the Party's important decisions on ideological and economic work and the Soviet Union's international situation.

    Holding training classes for propagandists everywhere is of great significance. This is cultivating a large army of ideological front workers. Naturally, this undertaking must be organized with the greatest sense of responsibility.

    First of all, the selection of trainees for the training classes must begin now with careful and deliberate consideration. Trainees should be people who are competent in all aspects of propaganda work and guaranteed to have a high level of scholarship. Leaders of political schools and groups are not cold and ruthless village school teachers, but active propagandists of Marxist-Leninist thought, and fighters of the Party. In order to have principled, competent propagandists, it is necessary to formally and regularly study and collect experience.

    The selection of instructors for the propaganda cadre training classes is also of great significance. This work can only be entrusted to highly accomplished lecturers, Party work leaders, and people who can explain the spiritual essence of revolutionary theory to the students. We have many experienced and well-cultivated Party propagandists who can educate students to love theory and enable students to learn to apply the Party's ideological weapons to practical work.

    Some experience has been gained in organizing propaganda cadre training classes. For example, the Yaroslavl Party organization has implemented the instructions of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and begun to hold propaganda cadre training classes. In Yaroslavl and Shcherbakov cities, five hundred leaders of urban political schools and groups have already begun to study. They were selected from individual secretaries and propaganda ministers of the Party's district committees. Then the list of trainees for the training classes needs to be approved by the Party's municipal committees. The instructors are equipped with the strongest cadres from the local area.

    Party organizations should make the work of the training classes exemplary, so that propagandists can profoundly study their courses and improve their theoretical level. In the training classes, while studying the prescribed materials, the vivid experience of the best leaders of groups and political schools should be effectively applied to the study of discussion meetings. Undoubtedly, this will be of great benefit to the propagandists and can be well transmitted to all of the Party's education.

    The task of Party organizations is to provide propagandists with the necessary conditions to complete their theoretical and teaching knowledge, and to constantly educate and take special care of them.

    As for the propagandists themselves, they must always understand the extremely important political cause that the Party has entrusted to them. Only through hard work is it possible to deeply understand and acquire the spiritual essence of Marxism-Leninism and master more proficient propaganda methods.

    We need such propaganda cadres: based on the solid knowledge of Marxist-Leninist science and the works of Lenin and Stalin, they can freely determine the direction in the domestic and international situation, can answer any political questions of the workers, explain any theoretical topics, and ensure that their students cultivate lofty ideas and Bolshevik convictions and strength.

### 宣传员干部的培养

　　宣传员干部的培养
    我国满怀信心地走着新而伟大的上升道路。坚强地发展着工业，农业，文化，艺术。思想意识的工作，已达到更广大的规模。在本学年内，党员和候补党员的政治教育，获得了显著的改进。
    现在政治学校和小组的过去学习总结，独立地研究马列主义科学的人们所举行的集体的理论漫谈，显示出共产党员的理论水平提高了，知识是更渊博和巩固了。
    党时常认为马列主义宣传的高度思想水平，是最重要的事情。列宁和斯大林屡次地强调宣传员的高度责任心，认为宣传员的工作只能委托给有资格的、保证具备充分的知识以教育我们布尔什维克主义干部的人们。
    党在领导社会主义建设的巨大工作进程中，培养出千百万个宣传员来。他们是劳动者中布尔什维克思想意识的积极引导人，是使干部具有马列主义思想的战斗的培养者。
    以青年的力量补充宣传员的行列时时在进行着。在党的教育中，宣传员干部的改进，是学年总结中最令人满意的一件事。大约有一半的宣传员，是曾受过高等教育或正在高等学校学习。有大批党的、苏维埃的、经济的积极分子做讲习班、小组与政治学校的领导工作。因此，最近时期宣传员方面充实了一些政治上最有经验有修养的共产党员。这就证明了地方党组织正确地了解了自己在党的教育部门中主要的任务，并且把经常的改进宣传员干部做为自己重大的工作。
    然而不能说一切宣传员已经能以他们的知识和经验，负起对他们最高的要求了。联共（布）党中央委员会在本年开始时指示雅罗斯拉夫的党组织说，它尚待解决的主要问题，即是保证一切小组与学校有高深造诣的宣传员，这个指示不仅对雅罗斯拉夫的党有直接关系，而且对其他的许多党组织也具有同样意义。
    在某些地方，直到如今还没有肃清学习中的形式主义与经院学派，生动的讨论，却经常代替以题解的方法。这势必引到机械地记诵个别的事实和情况，助长了死读书，而不是有创造性地讨论与理解学习的材料。在教授革命的理论时，同样的缺点是在于：不注意进行宣传员干部的选择和教育，也不给以帮助。
    这就是为什么在新学年的准备中，必须对宣传员干部进一步的改进与培养，给以首要的注意。任何时候不能忘记，宣传员是党教育中的基本形象。
    联共（布）党中央委员会几天前通过的决议在一九四九年暑期，组织政治学校和小组领导者的训练班，以研究列宁斯大林传记及联共（布）党史是党关心提高宣传员思想理论水平与有系统的知识的又一表现。党的市委会，组织了三个月为期的城市宣传员训练班。他们的学习，将不脱离工作岗位。省党委会，边区党委会，加盟共和国的党中央委员会，都组织了一个月为期的农村宣传员训练班，他们在学习期间，暂时离开主要的工作。
    训练班的学习计划，除一般理论的纲领外，还规定了讲义与讨论会的主题。对于农村的宣传员，同样计划阅读一系列的讲义，与党关于思想意识、经济工作、苏联国际形势等问题的重要决定的报告。
    在各地举办宣传员训练班是有重大意义的。这就是培养一支思想战线工作者的大军。自然，必须以最大的责任心来组织这个事业。
    首先，现在就必须开始仔细地深思熟虑地选择训练班的学员。学员应当是在宣传工作各方面都能胜任、保证有高度学识的人。政治学校及小组的领导者，并不是冷酷无情的三家村教书匠，而是马列主义思想的积极宣传员，是党的战士。为了或为原则上称职的有能力的宣传员，必须正式地时常研究与搜集经验。
    给宣传员训练班选择教员，也具有重大意义。这个工作只能委托给有高深造诣的讲演员、党的工作领导者和能够把革命理论的精神实质讲解给学员的人。我们有许多经验丰富的与各方面有修养的党的宣传员，他们能够教育学员爱好理论，并使学员学会以党的思想武器运用到实际工作中去。
    组织宣传员训练班，已经得到某些经验。如雅罗斯拉夫党组织实现了联共（布）党中央委员会的指示，开始举办了宣传员训练班。在雅罗斯拉夫与什切尔巴克夫城，五百个城市的政治学校与小组领导者，已经开始学习。他们是从党的区委会中个别的书记和宣传部长挑选出来的。然后进训练班的学员名单，需经过党的市委会批准。教员是从地方上最强的干部配备的。
    党组织应当使训练班的工作成为模范性的，以便宣传员能够深刻地研究自己的课程，提高理论的水平。在训练班中，一方面研究规定的材料，同时应当将小组与政治学校最好领导者的生动经验，有效地运用到讨论会的学习中。无疑地，这封宣传员们是有巨大的益处，并能很好地传达到全部党的教育中去。
    党组织的任务，是给宣传员完成理论的与教学知识，建立必要的条件，并要经常地教育与特别关心他们。
    至于宣传员本身，必须时刻了解党付托给他们的极重要的政治事业。只有艰苦地工作，才有可能深刻地理解与获得马列主义的精神实质，精通更纯熟的宣传方式。
    我们需要这样的宣传员干部：依据马列主义的科学的巩固知识与列宁和斯大林的著作，在国内国际形势中自如地判定方向，能够解答劳动者的任何政治问题，解释任何理论课题，保证给自己的学员培植崇高的思想及布尔什维克的确信和坚强。
