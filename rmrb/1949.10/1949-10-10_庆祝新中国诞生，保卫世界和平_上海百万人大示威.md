Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 9th: Shanghai held an unprecedented million-person demonstration and parade on the 8th, celebrating the birth of New China and defending world peace. This was the culmination of the week-long celebrations and jubilation of Shanghai's six million citizens since the 1st, and the largest demonstration in Chinese history. Around 7:00 AM on the 8th, the parade teams gathered in different districts, converging into a sea of people everywhere. More than 600 five-star red flags were raised in the large square of the Racecourse, and a giant red star was placed in front of the tall reviewing stand, which was solemn and majestic, to review the million people.

Throughout the morning, the parade teams converged on the Racecourse from all directions, turning the area around the Racecourse into a sea of people. At 1:00 PM, Rao Shushi, Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Zeng Shan, Pan Hannian, Deputy Mayors of the Shanghai People's Government, Guo Huaruo, Commander of the Songhu Garrison, Liu Changsheng, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, Shu Tong, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, and representatives from farmers, youth, women, cultural and educational circles, business circles, various democratic parties, and Soviet friend Vladimirov, entered the venue amidst thunderous applause and ascended the reviewing stand. After the review began, cannons boomed, and the military band played the new national anthem and the Internationale. The mighty parade teams entered the Racecourse simultaneously in three routes: the first route came from the northeast, led by workers from the Hudong District; the second route came from the due north, led by students from the Huxi District; and the third route came from the southeast, led by the People's Liberation Army. After a while, the three armies converged in front of the central reviewing stand in the Racecourse, and the entire Racecourse became a sea of red flags. In particular, the soldiers had a red flag inserted in each muzzle, fluttering in the wind, resembling a sea of flames from afar. As each parade contingent marched past the reviewing stand in neat steps, they all paid attention and saluted the stand. Rao Shushi, Liu Changsheng, Guo Huaruo, Shu Tong, and others on the stage also waved to the parade teams and used loudspeakers to lead the entire venue in chanting slogans such as "Down with imperialism!" "Defend world peace!" "Strengthen Sino-Soviet cooperation!" "Long live the People's Republic of China!" "Long live the Central People's Government!" "Long live the Communist Party of China!" "Long live Chairman Mao!"

After the review, the parade began, still departing in three routes. This three-pronged army of one million people marched from about 1:00 PM until late at night without finishing. As the parade teams had already filled the main streets of Shanghai, the Racecourse Square was still a sea of people. The parade teams held tens of thousands of red flags, some holding torches high, and others carrying various lanterns. The workers' teams held hammer lanterns and axe lanterns made to resemble their own production tools, and many teams held airplane lanterns, tank lanterns, cannon lanterns, and warship lanterns. Some parade teams carried the goddess of peace, or the fortress of peace, or the black coffin of Chiang Kai-shek. The Yangko teams, waist drum teams, costume propaganda teams, and dragon lantern teams danced as they walked. The city resounded with slogans.

At 2:00 PM, 360 peace doves were released in front of the reviewing stand, soaring in the sunlight. Hundreds of red balloons were released twice at 4:00 PM and 6:00 PM, rising into the sky with the wind. A rainbow appeared in the sky at dusk, adding to the city's magnificent colors. At night, all the lights in the city were turned on, and the parade teams also lit lanterns and torches, illuminating the entire city in a red glow. From 8:00 PM, colored flares were continuously fired from the Racecourse, followed by fireworks. Overlooking the city from the 24th floor of the International Hotel, one could see a scene of brilliance, illuminating the night sky.

　　庆祝新中国诞生，保卫世界和平
    上海百万人大示威
    【新华社上海九日电】上海市八日举行规模空前的庆祝新中国诞生和保卫世界和平的一百万人示威大游行。这是上海六百万市民自一日以来热烈举行的庆祝欢狂周的顶点，是中国人民有史以来最大的一次示威游行。八日早晨七时许，游行队伍即分区集合，到处汇成人的巨海。跑马厅大广场上升起了六百多面五星红旗，检阅这一百万人的高大的检阅台前安置着一颗巨大的红星，气象异常庄严雄伟。
    整个上午，游行队伍从四面八方向跑马厅会合，跑马厅四周顿成人山人海。下午一时正，中共上海市委书记饶漱石、上海人民市政府副市长曾山、潘汉年、淞沪警备司令郭化若、沪总工会筹备会主任刘长胜、中共中央华东局宣传部长舒同及农民、青年、妇女、文化教育界、工商界、各民主党派的代表，和苏联友人符拉基米洛夫等在雷动的掌声中进入会场，登上检阅台，检阅式开始后，礼炮轰鸣，军乐队齐奏新国歌和国际歌。浩浩荡荡的游行队伍分三路同时进入跑马厅：第一路自东北方而来，由沪东区工人带头；第二路自正北方而来，由沪西学生带头；第三路自东南方而来，由人民解放军带头。移时，三路大军一齐在跑马厅中心检阅台前大会师，跑马厅全场顿时成为一片红旗的海洋，特别是军队，每个枪口插着一面红旗，迎风腊腊，远望如烈焰跳跃的火海。当各游行纵队以齐整的步伐走过检阅台时，均向台上注目致敬。台上饶漱石、刘长胜、郭化若、舒同等亦不断向游行队伍挥手答礼，并用扩音器领导全场高呼：“打倒帝国主义！”“保卫世界和平！”“加强中苏合作！”“中华人民共和国万岁！”“中央人民政府万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”等口号。
    检阅后，即开始游行，仍分三路出发。这一支一百万人的三路游行大军从下午一时许出动一直延续到深夜还没有走完，当游行的队伍已排满了大上海的主要市街，而跑马厅广场上仍然是人山人海。游行的队伍持着千万面红旗，有的高擎着火炬，有的则提着各式各样的灯笼。工人队伍举着仿照自己的生产工具所做的锤子灯、斧头灯，还有许多队伍则高举着飞机灯、坦克灯、大炮灯、兵舰灯。游行队伍中也有的抬着和平女神，或抬着和平堡垒，或抬着蒋介石的黑棺材。游行队伍中的秧歌队、腰鼓队、化装宣传队、龙灯队边走边舞。全市口号声震天动地。
    下午二时，检阅台前放起了三百六十只和平鸽子，在阳光下凌空飞翔。四时、六时两次放起数百只红色汽球，随风升向高空。黄昏时天空现出了彩虹，更增加了全市瑰丽的色彩。入夜，全市电灯齐明，游行队伍亦点起灯笼、火炬，照耀全市一片通红。八时起，跑马厅连续放出彩色照明弹，继又燃放焰火。从国际饭店的二十四层楼上俯瞰全市，只见一片光辉，照澈夜空。
