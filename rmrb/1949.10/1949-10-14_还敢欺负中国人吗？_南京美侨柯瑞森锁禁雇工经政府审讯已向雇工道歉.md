Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 13th: The case of American resident Corrison (former military attaché of the American Embassy in the puppet government of Nanjing) violating the laws of the People's Government by infringing on personal freedom and locking up four employees has concluded. Corrison has admitted his mistake, written a letter of repentance, and bowed to each of the four employees to apologize.

On the afternoon of September 9th, American resident Corrison forced his Chinese employees, Wang Songlin, Cai Wenhua, Chen Guangqing, and Jiang Fashan, to receive vaccinations. Wang Songlin and the others refused, stating that they had already been vaccinated and that summer had passed. Corrison seized the opportunity to declare that Wang, Chen, Cai, and Jiang had "disobeyed orders," paid them twenty days' severance pay, and immediately fired them. He then forced Wang and the others to sign a "severance pay receipt," which Wang and the others sternly refused. Corrison then forced Wang Songlin and the others to sign a "proof of refusal to accept severance pay," which was also refused. Corrison then drove the employees out of the residence. Wang and the others argued on the basis of reason and refused to leave. At 6:00 PM, Corrison instructed his wife to lock the gate, and the four employees were immediately illegally detained and completely lost their freedom.

When the employees' families learned of this, they immediately reported it to the Foreign Affairs Management Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. The Foreign Affairs Management Section immediately dispatched two foreign affairs police officers to the American resident's residence at 21 Yihe Road to investigate. At this time, the gate was still locked. Wang, Chen, Cai, and Jiang could only appeal to the foreign affairs police officers from the upstairs window. It was not until the next morning that Wang and the others regained their freedom.

At 10:30 AM on the 10th, the Foreign Affairs Management Section summoned both parties for interrogation. Corrison, knowing that the evidence was conclusive and that he could not deny it, requested to admit his mistake on the spot and issue a letter of repentance. This was agreed to by the employees and approved by the interrogator. The full text of the letter of repentance is as follows: "I, Corrison, admit that on September 9th of this year, from 6:00 PM to 7:15 PM, I locked the gate of my residence (21 Yihe Road) with the purpose of detaining the following individuals within that time: Wang Songlin, Chen Guangqing, Cai Wenhua, and Jiang Fashan, preventing them from leaving, and I admit that this action was a mistake and violated the laws of the Nanjing Municipal People's Government. This is hereby certified. (Signed) Corrison. September 9, 1949."

On the same day, another American resident, Bacon (former US Consul), issued a guarantee to allow Corrison to return to his residence, guaranteeing that he would be available whenever summoned until the case was closed.

After this, although Corrison repeatedly researched, he ultimately failed to find any basis for overturning the case. On the morning of September 17th, at 8:30 AM, he responded to the summons to resolve the matter. After Corrison brought his legal advisor, the American Biham, to argue unsuccessfully, he personally formally apologized to the employees, saying: "Wang, Chen, Cai, Jiang: I locked you up, I am very sorry, I violated the laws of the People's Government. You should leniently punish me, let me begin by apologizing to you." After saying this, he bowed to each of the four employees to apologize.

At this point, the entire case was concluded. The interrogator announced: After investigation, Corrison arbitrarily locked up employees, obstructing their personal freedom, and violating the laws of the People's Government. He should be punished according to law, but considering that Corrison is a first-time offender and has admitted his mistake, he will be treated leniently. Finally, Corrison was asked again if he had any other comments. Corrison said he was grateful, and the interrogation was declared over.

　　还敢欺负中国人吗？
    南京美侨柯瑞森锁禁雇工经政府审讯已向雇工道歉
    【新华社南京十三日电】美侨柯瑞森（前驻南京伪政府的美国大使馆武官）违犯人民政府法令，侵害人身自由，锁禁雇工四名案件，已告结束。柯瑞森已承认错误，书写悔过书，并向四位雇工一一鞠躬道歉。上月九日下午美侨柯瑞森强迫其住宅华籍雇工王松林、蔡文华、陈广清、姜发善四人注射防疫针，王松林等以早经注射，且夏季已过，不愿注射，柯便乘机宣布王、陈、蔡、姜“违抗命令”，发给二十天解雇费即刻解雇，并强迫王等在“解雇费收据”签字，当为王等严词拒绝。柯又逼令王松林等签一“拒绝接受解雇费之证明”，亦被拒绝。柯瑞森便驱逐雇工离开该住宅，王等据理申辩，不愿离去。至下午六时柯瑞森指使其妻将大门加锁，四位雇工即横遭非法拘禁，完全失去自由。该雇工家属得悉，即时向本市公安局外侨管理科报告，外侨管理科当即派外事警察二人赴颐和路二十一号该美侨住宅门口调查。此时大门仍被锁禁。王、陈、蔡、姜四雇工只能在楼窗上向外事警察申诉。至翌日晨，王等始恢复自由。十日上午十时半外侨管理科传双方当事人到案审讯，柯瑞森自知证据确鉴，无法抵赖，遂请求当场承认错误并出具悔过书。当得到雇工同意，审讯人批准。该悔过书全文如下：“本人——柯瑞森，承认在本年九月九日晚六时至七时一刻，将本人住宅大门（颐和路二十一号）上锁，其目的为在该时间内扣留下列各人：王松林、陈广清、蔡文华、姜发善，俾不能离开，并承认此项举动系一错误，违犯南京市人民政府法律，此具。（签名）柯瑞森。一九四九年九月九日。”当日有另一美侨贝肯（前美领事）出具保证书保柯回寓，保证在该案未了结前随传随到。此后柯瑞森虽一再研究，终未找出翻案根据，乃于九月十七日上午八时半应传到案解决。柯在携来其法律顾问美人毕翰约辩护无效后，乃亲自向雇工正式道歉说：“王、陈、蔡、姜：我锁了你们，很对不起，我违犯了人民政府法令，你们从宽地处罚我，让我开始向你们道歉。”言毕，即向四位雇工一一敬礼道歉。至此全案结束，审讯人宣布：查柯瑞森擅自锁禁雇工妨害人身自由，违犯人民政府法令，本应依法治罪，姑念柯系初犯，且已承认错误，故予以从宽处理。最后再一次询问柯瑞森尚有何意见，柯称感激，审讯乃宣告结束。
