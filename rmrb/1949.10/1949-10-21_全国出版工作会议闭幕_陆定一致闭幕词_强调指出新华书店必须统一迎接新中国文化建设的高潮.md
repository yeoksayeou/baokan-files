Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 19th – The National Xinhua Bookstore Publishing Work Conference successfully concluded today. Lu Dingyi, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, personally delivered the closing speech. He pointed out that the achievement of this conference was that it reached unanimous agreement on policies, organization, systems, and operations, laying the foundation for the national Xinhua Bookstore to move towards unification and concentration. He emphasized that the issue of unification is the most important issue for Xinhua Bookstore at present. Only by unifying can Xinhua Bookstore have the strength to welcome the future high tide of cultural construction in New China. Currently, Xinhua Bookstore only has 735 branches, which is far behind the development of the military situation in terms of quantity. There are two thousand counties in the country, countless towns and vast rural areas. The work of eliminating illiteracy will begin in a few years. Therefore, we must now strive for unification in a planned and step-by-step manner to prepare conditions and adapt to this ever-expanding demand. Finally, he put forward five hopes to the representatives present: First, serve the people unconditionally. Publishing undertakings and publishers who do this have a bright future. Second, serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers first, and never forget the workers, peasants, and soldiers after entering the cities. Third, support unification and truly abide by the resolutions of this conference. Fourth, cooperate sincerely and frankly with various public-private joint venture publishing industries and private publishing industries. Fifth, members of Xinhua Bookstore are both revolutionaries and publishers. Personnel who are assigned as publishers in the division of labor of revolutionary work are glorious because they are first and foremost revolutionaries. Therefore, Minister Lu called on all Xinhua Bookstore personnel to work hard to study politics, theory, and business, and never deviate from politics or the people.

The closing ceremony of the conference was held at 3:00 PM. First, Chairman Hu Yuzhi reported on the progress of the conference. The conference opened on the 3rd and held a total of sixteen plenary sessions, as well as various group meetings and preparatory meetings. In addition to solving many problems of Xinhua Bookstore itself and exchanging experiences from branch stores in various regions, a tea party was also held to receive representatives of the Soviet cultural, scientific, and artistic workers delegation, including Deomidov, Chairman of the Soviet International Bookstore, and a lecture meeting was organized for Deomidov, from which much experience was learned. Hu Yuzhi pointed out that the conference had been conducted under the concern of the CPC Central Committee and the direct leadership of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee. Minister Lu Dingyi and Vice Ministers Chen Boda and Hu Qiaomu had all addressed the conference. What excited the representatives the most was that Chairman Mao personally received all the representatives in his busy schedule and Vice Chairman Zhu De came to speak in person. After Hu Yuzhi's report, guests Chen Shaoxian, Fu Binran, and others spoke successively, and finally, Minister Lu delivered the closing speech.

　　全国出版工作会议闭幕
  　陆定一致闭幕词
    强调指出新华书店必须统一迎接新中国文化建设的高潮
    【新华社北京十九日电】全国新华书店出版工作会议今日圆满闭幕。中共中央宣传部部长陆定一亲临致闭幕辞。他指出这次会议的成绩就是在政策上、组织上、制度上、业务上都得出了一致的意见，奠定了全国新华书店走向统一和集中的基础。他强调指出统一的问题是新华书店当前最重要的问题。必须统一，新华书店才有力量来迎接将来新中国文化建设的高潮。现在新华书店只有七百三十五家分店，数量上远远落在军事发展的形势之后。全国有两千个县份，有无数的市镇和广大的农村，几年以后就要开始消灭文盲的工作，所以现在一定要有计划有步骤的力谋统一，才能准备条件，才能适应这个日益扩大的要求。最后，他向到会代表提出五点希望：一、无条件地为人民服务，这样做的出版事业和出版家是有光辉前途的。二、首先为工农兵服务，切不可进了城市，就忘记了工农兵。三、要拥护统一，要真正遵守这次大会的决议。四、诚恳坦白地与各公私合营的出版业和私营的出版业合作。五、新华书店的成员是革命家兼出版家。在革命工作的分工中被分配为出版家的人员是光荣的，因为他首先是革命家。因此陆部长号召所有新华书店的人员努力学习政治、理论和业务，切不可脱离政治，脱离人民。
    会议闭幕式是在下午三时举行的。首由主席胡愈之报告会议经过。会议于三日开幕，共举行大会十六次，还召开了各种小组会和预备会。除解决了新华书店本身的许多问题是交换了各地分店的经验之外，还举行了招待苏联文化科学艺术工作者代表团代表苏联国际书店主席德奥米多夫的茶话会和主办了德氏的讲演会，学习了不少经验。胡愈之指出会议一直在中共中央的关心和中共中央宣传部的直接领导下进行，陆定一部长和陈伯达、胡乔木副部长都曾向大会讲话。最使代表们兴奋的是毛主席在百忙中亲自接见全体代表和朱德副主席亲临讲话。胡愈之报告毕，有来宾陈劭先、傅彬然等相继讲话，最后由陆部长致闭幕词。
