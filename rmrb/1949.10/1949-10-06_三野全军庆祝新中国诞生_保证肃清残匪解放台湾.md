	Vows to Eliminate Remaining Bandits and Liberate Taiwan
    [Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] The entire body of commanders and fighters of the East China Military Region and the Third Field Army of the People's Liberation Army are ecstatically celebrating the founding of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, and enthusiastically participating in the "International Day of Struggle for Peace" grand demonstration. More than 20,000 People's Liberation Army soldiers stationed in Nanjing, including the entire American-equipped howitzer regiment, the People's Navy, and the officers and soldiers of the glorious uprising of the Changzhi warship, participated in the demonstration parade. Barracks everywhere were decorated with lanterns and colored banners, and the sound of gongs and drums filled the air, plastered with slogans like "Long Live Chairman Mao," "Support the Central People's Government," and "Defend World Peace." The commanders and fighters had haircuts and shaves, and changed their clothes, reflecting a joyful and new atmosphere. The People's Liberation Army on the front lines along the coasts of Fujian and Zhejiang held celebrations on the battlefield, and accelerated the offensive against the remaining bandits. More than 450 PLA work teams spread across the mountainous areas of Zhejiang and southern Anhui, as well as along the coast, conducted propaganda activities in the vast towns and villages to celebrate the founding of the Central People's Government. Various corps and armies sent congratulatory telegrams to Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government. A certain army, which was currently engaged in suppressing bandits, said in its congratulatory telegram to Chairman Mao: "We are determined to eliminate banditry and mobilize the masses as a congratulatory gift for the birth of the Central People's Government!" Many soldiers also bought red and green paper to write congratulatory letters and resolutions to Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, and set out plans to Chairman Mao for learning how to fight well and doing a good job in mass work.
