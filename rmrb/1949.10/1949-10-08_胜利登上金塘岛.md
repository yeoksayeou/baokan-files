Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 7th. Frontline reporters Liu Liang and Li Ke reported the People's Liberation Army's victorious landing on Jintang Island in the Zhoushan Islands on October 3rd: On the afternoon of the 3rd, amidst continuous rain and thick fog at sea, the prelude battle for the People's Liberation Army to cross the sea and liberate the Zhoushan Islands began. The commanders and fighters of the Liberation Army have been excited by a series of news items in the last fourteen days, including the opening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the establishment of the Central People's Government, and the glorious election of Chairman Mao as Chairman. Everyone decided to quickly liberate the Zhoushan Islands as a gift to Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government. Requests from various companies to undertake arduous tasks flew to the headquarters like snowflakes. Every commander and fighter regarded it as an honor to strive for the first boat. The high morale of the commanders and fighters is difficult to describe. Before dusk on the 3rd, when the order to cross the sea and attack was issued to the front line positions, it aroused a frenzy of cheers on the vast coast. On the artillery positions spanning 20,000 meters, the artillerymen, from the fortifications affixed with the bulletin "Celebrating the Establishment of the Central People's Government," fired thousands of shells over the 4,000-meter hazy sea surface at the enemy's beachhead positions on Jintang Island, according to the target records that had been aimed at long ago. Thousands of warriors wearing American-made lifebuoys boarded various large and small ships. Red and green flags emblazoned with "Attack Dinghai!" were planted on the bows of the ships. For a time, the coastal sailing boats stood like a forest, with flags fluttering. At 7 o'clock, the heavy rain suddenly stopped, and the previously adverse northeast wind suddenly turned into a favorable south wind. Various colored signal flares from each departure point flew into the sky simultaneously, and immediately thousands of boats set off together, riding the wind and waves towards Jintang Island in the fog. At this time, the artillerymen stared intently at the undulating sea surface, and when another series of colored signal flares rose in the ocean, overwhelming artillery fire bombarded the opposite shore. Flashes of fire flickered, the roar shook the sky, and large and small warships quickly sailed through the rapids and pounced on the opposite shore. The remaining bandits hiding in the fortifications at the foot of the beach hill hurriedly fired their machine guns and rifles, but our heroic fighters, riding fearless warships, sped towards the shore. At exactly eight o'clock, various colored signal flares of victorious landing flew like countless shooting stars in the sky above Jintang Island.

    刘亮　力科
    【新华社南京七日电】前线记者刘亮、力科报道浙东前线人民解放军十月三日在舟山群岛金塘岛胜利登陆的情形称：三日下午，海上淫雨霏霏，云雾茫茫，浙东前线解放军跨海解放舟山群岛的序幕战斗揭开了。解放军指战员们十四日来为人民政协开幕、中央人民政府成立、毛主席光荣当选为主席，……一连串的消息所激动，大家决定以迅速解放舟山群岛作为给毛主席和中央人民政府的献礼。各连队要求担任艰巨任务的请求书，雪片似地飞到指挥部。每一个指战员都以争座第一船为荣。指战员们战斗情绪的高涨是难以描述的。三日黄昏前，当渡海出击的命令下达到前线阵地时，在广阔的海滨上激起了一片狂热的欢呼。在横阔二万米的炮兵阵地上，炮手们从贴着“庆祝中央人民政府成立”的快报的工事里，按照早已瞄好的目标纪录，把数千发炮弹超越四千公尺云雾朦胧的海面，打到金塘岛敌人的滩头阵地上。万千个身带美造救生圈的勇士们，纷纷登上各大小船只。“打到定海去！”的红绿彩旗插上船头，一时沿海帆船林立，旗幡招展。七时，急雨忽歇，原来相逆的东北风，忽然转为相顺的南风。各起渡点的各色信号弹一齐飞向天空，立刻千舟齐发，乘风破浪向雾中的金塘岛前进。此时炮兵们紧瞅着浪涛起伏的海面，当又一连串的彩色信号弹在海洋中升起时，排山倒海的炮火轰向对岸。火光闪闪，咆哮震天，大小战船迅速驶过急流向对岸猛扑。躲在海滩山角下工事中的残匪们，慌忙将机步枪打过来，但我英勇的战士们乘着无畏的兵船，向岸边急驶。首先靠岸的勇士们，纷纷跳下船来，冒着敌人炮火冲上岸去。正八点钟，各色胜利登陆的信号弹，象无数的流星一样飞舞在金塘岛上空。
