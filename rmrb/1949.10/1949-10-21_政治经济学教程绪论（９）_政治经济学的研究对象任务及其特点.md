Political Economics Tutorial Introduction (9)
　The Research Object, Tasks, and Characteristics of Political Economics

    Chapter One: Mode of Production
    Section One: Productive Forces
    Cooperation and division of labor must be well organized to improve productivity.
    Simple cooperation and complex cooperation (division of labor) are two forms of labor organization. Both forms of labor organization can improve productivity. However, the labor force must be well organized, and the labor force (workers) must be properly equipped. For example, in simple cooperation, if only fifteen people (that is, fifteen labor forces) are needed to carry large trees or large stones, but twenty people are used to carry them, the labor force of five people is obviously wasted. In complex cooperation (division of labor), if a certain part of the labor only needs one labor force, but two people are assigned to it, the labor force is excessive; if a certain part of the labor needs two labor forces, but only one person is assigned to it, then the allocation is insufficient. Too much or too little is inappropriate. Furthermore, each part of the labor, not only the labor force (personnel) allocation should be appropriate, but also the order of priority and mutual connection must be clarified in order to truly achieve the effect of division of labor and cooperation. Otherwise, if there is division of labor but insufficient cooperation, or cooperation but unclear division of labor, it will reduce production efficiency and fail to improve productivity.
    The development of labor tools can also lead to the development of labor power.
    In addition, the development of labor tools can also lead to the development of labor power. For example, without the invention of machines, there would be no modern industrial workers; without electric machines, there would be no electrical workers; of course, without trains, cars, and airplanes, there would be no train drivers, car workers, and pilots. At the same time, labor tools can also have a significant impact and effect on the organization and combination of labor power and its development. For example, the invention of iron tools allowed agricultural production to be carried out by individual labor units, instead of the original collective labor; the invention of modern steam engines and working machines triggered the modern industrial revolution, creating the organization of modern capitalist large-scale factory labor. Therefore, the changes and development of labor tools such as tools and machines can also cause changes and development in labor power and labor organization.
    What determines the size of the labor force?
    In summary, the size of the labor force, the amount of labor power exerted, depends not only on its quantity and quality, but also on the degree of labor skill, labor intensity, the appropriateness of labor organization, labor enthusiasm, and the degree of development of labor tools, etc.
    What determines the size of the productive forces?
    Labor power and means of production are combined to become the two elements of productive forces. The size of the productive forces depends on the situation of the means of production and labor power themselves, as well as the combination of the two, that is, on the organization and allocation of the two, and on the magnitude of the power exerted after the two are combined. Specifically, it depends on the allocation of labor power and means of production. Based on the production technology at the time, neither should one side be excessive nor the other side be insufficient, nor should there be excessive or insufficient labor, nor excessive or insufficient use of means of production, but rather appropriate allocation and appropriate use. Furthermore, the ratio of labor power and means of production should be changed with the improvement of labor skills and production technology, so as to continuously improve and develop productive forces. Under the New Democratic economy, we must pay attention to this point in order to develop the social productive forces.

  　政治经济学的研究对象任务及其特点
    王学文
    第一章　生产方式
    第一节　生产力
    协力与分工必须组织得好，才能提高生产力
    单纯的协力与复杂的协力（分工），是劳动组织的两种形式。这两种劳动组织形式，都是能提高生产力的。但是必须劳动力组织得好，劳动力（工人）配备恰当。例如单纯协力中，仍以搬运大树或大石为例，如果只要十五个人（即十五个劳动力），就可以搬运的，结果用二十个人去搬，其中五个人的劳动力显然是浪费了。又如复杂协力（分工）中，如果某部分劳动只需要一个劳动力的，结果分配了二个人去，劳动力就过多了；又如某部分劳动，需要两个劳动力的，结果只分配了一个人去，那就分配的过少了。过多与过少，都是不妥当的。并且每一部分劳动，不单单是劳动力（人员）配备要恰当，而且要分清先后次序，和彼此联系，才能真正得到分工与协力的效果，否则有分工而协力不够或者协力而分工不明确，就会降低生产效率，提不高生产力。
    劳动手段的发展也能引起劳动力的发展。
    此外，劳动手段的发展，也可以引起劳动力的发展。例如：如果没有机器的发明，便不会有近代产业工人，如果没有电力机器，便不会有电气工人，当然如果没有火车、汽车和飞机，也不可能有火车司机、汽车工人和飞行驾驶员。同时，劳动手段对于劳动力的组织和结合的形式以及它们的发展，也能发生重大的影响和作用，例如：铁器工具的发明使农业生产可以由个体为单位的个别劳动来进行，可以不以原始集体劳动的方式来劳动了，又如近代蒸汽机与工作机的发明，引起了近代产业革命，造成了近代资本主义大规模工厂劳动的组织。故工具机器等劳动手段的变化发展，对劳动力与劳动力组织，也都是能引起变化发展的。
    劳动力的大小是由什么来决定的？
    总起来说：劳动力的大小，劳动力发挥的多少，不但要看它的数量与质量，而且要看劳动的熟练程度，劳动强度，劳动组织的恰当与否，劳动热忱以及劳动手段的发展程度，等等，来决定的。
    生产力的大小是由什么来决定的？
    劳动力与生产手段结合起来，成为生产力的两个要素。生产力的大小，要看生产手段与劳动力两者本身的情况，以及两者结合的情况，即要看两者组织配备的情况，看它们两者结合以后，发挥的力量大小来决定的。具体地说来，就是要看劳动力与生产手段两者的配备，在当时生产技术的基础上，既不要一方面过多，另一方面过少，也不要劳动过度或不足，也不要生产手段过度使用或使用不足，而是要适当地配备，适当地使用，并且要随着劳动熟练与生产技术等的提高，而改变劳动力与生产手段二者间的配备比率，这样才能不断地提高与发展生产力。在新民主主义经济下，我们要发展社会的生产力，对于这一点必须注意。
