Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 4th: The people of Korea, Poland, Romania, Finland and other countries held mass rallies for the International Day of Struggle for Peace, expressing their firm will to defend peace and oppose warmongers.

In the capital of the Korean People's Republic, Pyongyang, mass rallies were held in various locations, with a total of 300,000 people participating. The rally in Kim Il-sung Square in the city center was attended by 150,000 people. Kim Sung-hak, Chairman of the Pyongyang People's Committee, delivered the opening speech, saying that the Korean people, who are fighting for the unification and independence of Korea, firmly stand in the camp of all countries headed by the Soviet Union. The Korean people do not want a new war. They are now fighting to oppose a new war, to uphold world peace, and to oppose the conspiracy of the Rhee Syngman clique, the enemy of the Korean people, to launch a civil war. Representatives from all walks of life who attended the meeting spoke enthusiastically, unanimously expressing their firm support for the Soviet representative's proposal at the United Nations General Assembly to condemn the preparation of a new war, unconditionally prohibit the use of atomic weapons, and conclude a convention among the five powers to consolidate peace, and firmly expressed their opposition to the organization of the United Nations Commission on Korea and to overthrowing the Rhee Syngman puppet government. The conference also passed a congratulatory telegram to the Permanent Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace. Mass rallies were also held in the capitals, towns, and villages of each province of North Korea.

In Warsaw, the capital of Poland, a mass rally of 150,000 people was held in Victory Square on the 2nd. Present were Polish Deputy Prime Minister Kociszewski, members of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, representatives of the Polish Army, and Vice Chairman Rabaski of the Polish Committee for the Defense of Peace. Foreign youth delegations, headed by the delegation of the Soviet Communist Youth League, also came to participate in the meeting. Rabaski spoke first. His speech was repeatedly interrupted by cheers for Stalin, Beirut, Mao Zedong, Thorez, and Togliatti. He said: Seven hundred million people, together with Poland, are defending peace, defending Poland's borders and independence. Poland will fulfill its duty to the peoples of all nations who desire peace to answer the call of the world peace camp. Just as the peace camp has grown, Poland's strength has increased several times, so Poland will contribute to the strengthening of the peace camp through its achievements in production. Rabaski finally shouted: Long live the Soviet Union! Long live Stalin! Long live the People's Republic of China! Long live Beirut! Selipin, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Youth League, also delivered a speech at the meeting. The conference finally passed a resolution stating: We are with our great allies and freedom-loving countries. We vow to contribute all our strength to building a people's Poland advancing towards socialism.

In Romania, a mass rally of 150,000 people was held on the 2nd in the square of the University of Bucharest, where speakers and the masses unanimously expressed their support for the peace camp headed by the Soviet Union and their opposition to the American and British warmongers. Slogans and cartoons condemning the warmongers and their lackey Tito were posted everywhere in Romania's capital.

The Finnish National Peace Congress also solemnly opened in Helsinki on October 2nd. Approximately 700 representatives attended the conference, including Soviet Ambassador to Finland Savonenkov, diplomatic representatives from various People's Democratic countries, a Soviet delegation headed by Kuznetsov, Chairman of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, guests from France, Poland, and Sweden, members of the Finnish Permanent Peace Committee, and representatives of domestic peace organizations. Kuznetsov spoke at the meeting, saying that the Finnish Peace Congress would help develop the peace movement in Finland and strengthen the friendly relations between the Finnish and Soviet people. Strengthening good-neighborly relations between the two countries is a great contribution to the cause of peace. The Soviet people believe that the Finnish people will not allow themselves to be dragged into military adventures that will inevitably cost the common people dearly. The conference delegates unanimously passed a resolution welcoming the establishment of international organizations for the defense of peace and urging all Finnish citizens who desire the happiness of their motherland to unite. The conference also sent congratulatory telegrams to the Permanent Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace, the Soviet Committee for the Defense of Peace, and the American Permanent Peace Committee.
