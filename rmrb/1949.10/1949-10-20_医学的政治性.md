　　The Political Nature of Medicine
　　Yu Yidi, Standing Committee Member, Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Medical Workers Association

　　Medical workers are a type of freelance professional. In the old society, it was generally believed that medicine had nothing to do with politics, and that it was somehow detached from classes and parties. Old medical workers themselves often only knew how to treat illnesses and didn't ask about external affairs, considering themselves "spiritually independent" and "noble," not interested in politics and trying to avoid getting involved. They even thought that expressing concern about politics meant losing one's identity as a doctor and having ulterior motives. This ideological bias of separating medicine from politics was quite common. In the half-year since liberation, people in Beijing's medical field have undergone fundamental changes in their thinking, but many old medical personnel still hold the above prejudices.

　　Now we should examine: China has had public health for twenty years, and anti-tuberculosis work for more than ten years, but how much progress has been made? Obviously, it's very pitiful! Is it because there is a lack of talent? No! Is it because there is a lack of equipment? No! Before the War of Resistance, there were five sanatoriums in the suburbs of this city. After the Japanese surrendered, the Kuomintang reactionary government seized and rarely restored them, and they were soon shut down. Why? Is it because there are no patients? No, there are many, many patients. Everyone understands: The failure to promote public health, and the widespread spread of tuberculosis while patients cannot get treatment and isolation, is a result of the extreme hardship in people's lives caused by the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. This is a political issue, a class issue. That is to say: In the past, the object of public health was essentially limited to a small number of upper-class Chinese in a few large cities, that is, only to the bourgeoisie and a portion of the upper petty bourgeoisie. The object was very narrow; coupled with the monopoly and exploitation of imperialism and bureaucratic capital, the entire petty bourgeoisie and a part of the bourgeoisie also declined, so the object of public health became even narrower, and promotion and maintenance became even more difficult. Therefore, without fundamentally changing the socio-economic system, it is impossible to talk about developing health undertakings at all. In the past, this problem was considered to be the business of politicians, not something that medical workers should be concerned with. In fact, this is a very wrong idea that shows no concern for the interests of the people.

　　From the perspective of medical education, the serious problem is the lack of teachers. Our existing medical education institutions are insufficient in number, and almost all graduates each year go into clinical practice, while talents in basic medicine and public health are very scarce. The reason is simple: clinical practice means more income, while teaching or public health work does not provide enough income to make a living. This is another political issue, isn't it clear?

　　Diseases, as natural phenomena, are substantially a social phenomenon to a large extent. In a class society, the oppressed people live in poverty, with malnutrition, anemia, and various acute and chronic infectious diseases impossible to eliminate. For example, with the capitalist system and prostitution coexisting, it is impossible to eliminate venereal diseases. But we medical scientists are fully convinced that, except for hereditary diseases, tumors, endocrine diseases and other few diseases that require long-term efforts to eliminate, the vast majority of diseases can be eliminated by the current power of mankind. Even if some cannot be completely eradicated in a new democratic society or a socialist society, they can be completely eliminated in a communist society where everyone does their best and receives according to their needs. All other diseases can be eliminated due to the endless progress of science and the continuous improvement of people's living standards. In the future, mankind will only have death from aging and no diseases. We medical scientists should strive for such a future life for mankind. Therefore, we must care about politics and transform society. As long as we progress to that ideal and happy world without disease, mankind will no longer need medicine, and medicine will naturally perish. Our efforts today are to promote the elimination of disease and the demise of medicine as soon as possible, so that mankind can truly be free from disease and disaster, and all live long lives.

　　Secondly, the issue of factions within the medical community itself is also a political issue that should be overcome. Doctors originally belonged to the individualistic, freelance professional class, and because of the different countries where they studied, various factions formed among them, which has its social and historical reasons. However, the existence of these factions is a major obstacle to our unity and a major impediment to medical progress. In the past, we have made some efforts to eliminate sectarianism. During the period of occupation, due to national consciousness, its severity has been significantly reduced, but it still exists more or less in fact. Some people think that students who have studied in a certain country are familiar with the language, writing, techniques, and accustomed to the machinery and drugs of that country, and thus form a faction, which seems to be unavoidable. In fact, this is only a superficial view. We must work hard to overcome medical factions, advocate obeying the truth, and break down sectarianism. We must recognize that the existence of sectarianism is a unique phenomenon of semi-colonialism. Because China was a semi-colonial society in the past, there were several imperialist countries pressing down on it at the same time. The forces of these imperialists invaded China, their rise and fall fluctuating, influencing the forces of students who returned to China after studying abroad in domestic politics and society. Imperialists used us as salesmen for their culture and goods, and we also acquired their bourgeois exploitation consciousness and extreme individualism, so that we not only failed to learn from each other's strengths and cooperate with each other, but instead discriminated against each other and despised each other. The sectarianism that exists now is comprador-like, a natural product of a semi-colonial state. This is an undesirable phenomenon in the medical field and harms the interests of our people. Now we should be ashamed of the division of factions and consciously eliminate it. Under the common goal of serving the people, we obey the truth and learn the most advanced human scientific thought and technology in the world. We must abandon all erroneous foreign dogmas. In the past, we blindly worshiped the science of capitalist countries such as Britain and the United States. We prostrated ourselves before capitalist science, swallowing it whole, blindly moving it back unchanged. We failed to select and criticize it, taking its strengths and discarding its weaknesses, taking the part that is suitable for China's objective environment and discarding the part that is not suitable, and even more, we did not chew it, digest it, and transform it into China's own medicine. Extreme worship of capitalism becomes reliance on capitalism. Various drugs, various instruments, and machinery can rarely be manufactured by ourselves, and even there are very few people who can repair them, which needs to be overcome urgently. The ancients said: "A good doctor governs the country." A conscientious medical worker should think about his own country and people day and night, and he should think about issues related to the life and health of the majority of people. We want to make every one of the 30,000 doctors aware of serving the people wholeheartedly. In this way, serving the people and serving politics with medicine is by no means degrading medicine. On the contrary, this makes the original meaning of "benevolent art" more clear and concrete, and infinitely elevates the position of medicine. Only in this way can medicine itself develop. In the past, because we could only serve the interests and needs of a small number of privileged classes, the process of new medical education for more than 40 years only created less than 20,000 doctors. This was already enough for the small number of upper-level rulers, and there was an oversupply. Therefore, in the old society, except for a very small number of famous doctors, most medical personnel had absolutely no future. Now that the anti-people old regime has been overthrown, and power is in the hands of the people, all systems and facilities in this new society are based on the interests of the vast majority of people. Calculated at one doctor per thousand people, China needs 450,000 doctors. At that time, there will be no unemployed doctors. The medical personnel, who are now insignificant in number, will be respected and cherished by the people like treasures.

　　Science is the crystallization of the common labor of the broad masses of the people. Our existing knowledge and technology are the summary of the labor of many predecessors. Medicine can only conform to medical ethics if it serves the people, otherwise it is forgetting one's roots. Only by combining with the people and getting the assistance of the broad masses of the people can medicine progress and individuals develop.

　　Today, the people of our country are fighting heroically to build a new China, from which a bright future for mankind will be displayed. Whoever still holds an attitude of indifference to current politics is essentially maintaining the dark system of the old society. Now the barriers between democracy and anti-democracy are clearly defined between the enemy and us. "There is no exception: either leaning to imperialism or leaning to socialism. Neutrality is disguised, and there is no third way." However, "the imperialists and their running dogs, the Chinese reactionaries, will not be reconciled to their failure on this land of China." Recently, the US White Paper put forward "democratic individualism," in an attempt to alienate Chinese intellectuals, so that we remain a heap of loose sand, and he can divide and rule. Medical workers who have long received capitalist education, in particular, should distinguish between right and wrong and recognize the conspiracy of the imperialists. A patriotic Chinese, faced with this battle concerning the fate of the motherland and the people, should not adopt an indifferent attitude!

　　Now the entire liberated area is swept up in a wave of political study, but some medical workers insist on a purely technical viewpoint and disdain political study. For these people, I would like to make an analogy: a person who has a gun may be a bandit, or he may be a bandit army under Chiang Kai-shek, or he may be a People's Liberation Army soldier. The only difference lies in whether he has a political understanding and who he serves. Similarly, a person who has medical technology cannot be considered a complete medical worker. He must have a political understanding and serve the people to be considered a people's medical worker. How can one be a people's medical worker, and how can one serve better? First, one must step up study, arm one's mind, work hard to transform oneself, and firmly establish a position of serving the people, and then one can become a true people's medical worker.

　　医学的政治性
    北京市医务工作者协会筹备会常委  余贻倜
    医务工作者是一种自由职业者，在旧社会中，一般人都认为医学与政治毫无关系，似乎它是超然于阶级党派之外的，旧的医务工作者自身，也往往只知治病，不问外事，自以为“精神独立”，自命“清高”，对政治既不感兴趣，而且尽力避免牵入政治，甚至于认为对政治表示关心的，就是失掉了医生的身份而别有野心的。这种把医学与政治分离的思想上的偏向是相当普遍的。解放半年来的北京医界的人们，虽在思想上发生了根本的变化，但仍有不少旧的医务人员存在着上述偏见。
    现在应该让我们检讨一下：我国之有公共卫生已二十年，防痨工作也不只十年，这些工作究竟进展了多少呢？显然是很可怜的！是因为没有人才么？不是的！是因为没有设备么？不是的！本市郊区，抗战前曾有疗养院五所，日寇投降，国民党反动政府劫收后很少恢复，不久都就停办了。为什么呢？是没有病人么？不是的，病人是很多很多的。任何人都明白：公共卫生之不能推进，与结核病之普遍蔓延而病人不得疗养隔离，是因为国民党反动统治使人民生活极端困苦的结果。这就是一个政治问题，是一个阶级问题。就是说：过去公共卫生的对象实质上是仅仅限于几个大城市的少数高等华人，也就是仅限于资产阶级与一部分上层的小资产阶级，对象是很狭小的；加上帝国主义与官僚资本的垄断榨取，使得整个小资产阶级与一部分资产阶级也没落了，因此公共卫生的对象愈加狭小，推进和维持越发困难了。因此，不根本改变社会经济制度，开展卫生事业是根本谈不上的。这个问题，过去就被认为是政治家的事，不是医务工作者应该过问的。实际上，这是对人民利益毫不关心的极错误的想法。
    从医学教育上说，严重的问题，是缺乏师资，我们现有的医学教育机构在数量上本不够，而每年造成的毕业生几乎都走入临诊方面，而基础医学与公共卫生方面的人才则十分稀少。原因很简单：就是临症多则收入也多，教书或公共卫生工作的收入则不足维持生活。这又是一个政治问题，难道还不明白吗？
    作为自然现象的疾病，实质上有很大一部分是社会的现象。在阶级社会里，被压迫的人民，生活穷困，营养不良，贫血病、各种急性与慢性传染病是不可能被消灭的。比如：资本主义制度与娼妓并存，就不可能消灭性病。但我们医学家完全相信各种疾病中除了遗传病、肿瘤、内分泌疾病及其他少数疾病要经过长期努力才能消灭以外，绝大多数疾病都是可以由现在人类的力量予以消灭的。即使有些在新民主主义的社会里或在社会主义社会里尚不能完全扑灭，但在各尽所能各取所需的共产主义社会里则是完全可以消灭的。其他一切疾病均可由于科学无止境的进步、由于人民生活水准的不断提高，而被消灭。将来的人类将是没有疾病而只有衰老的死亡。我们医学家应该为着这样的人类未来生活而奋斗，因此，我们就必须关心政治，改造社会。只要我们进步到那样没有疾病的理想的幸福的世界里，人类不再需要医药，医药就自然灭亡了。我们今日的努力，为的是促使疾病的消灭与医药的灭亡早日到来，使人类真正无病无灾，同登寿域。
    其次，医学界本身的派别问题，也是一个政治问题，同样应该加以克服。医生原属于个人主义的自由职业者阶层，又因为留学国别的不同，因此，他们之间形成各种派别是有其社会的与历史的原因的。但，这种派别的存在，是我们团结的大障碍，也是医学进步的大阻力。过去我们已经作过若干努力，企图消灭宗派，在沦陷期间，由于民族的自觉，虽已显著地减轻其严重性，但是事实上还多多少少地存在着。有些人认为某国留学生熟习某国的言语文字、技术方法，用惯了某国的机械、药品，因而形成一种派别，似乎这是不可避免的，实际上这只是表面的看法。我们必须努力克服医学的派别，提倡服从真理，打破宗派。必须认识宗派的存在是半殖民地的特有现象。由于中国过去是半殖民地社会，压在它头上的在同一时间内有几个帝国主义的国家，这些帝国主义者侵入中国的势力，消长起伏，左右留学生回国后在国内政治上社会上的势力。帝国主义者利用我们作为它们的文化和商品的推销员，也习染了它们资产阶级的剥削意识与极端的个人主义，使我们不但不能择长补短，互助合作，反倒彼此歧视，互相轻蔑。现在存在的宗派主义是买办性的，是半殖民地的自然产物，这是医界不应有的现象，是危害我国人民利益的。现在我们应该以派别之分为耻，而自觉的来消除它。在为人民服务的共同目标下，服从真理，学习世界上最先进的人类的科学思想与技术。我们必须抛弃一切错误的洋教条。我们过去盲目崇拜英美等资本主义国家的科学。对资本主义科学五体投地，囫囵吞枣，盲目地把它们原封不动地搬回来。未能加以选择批判，取其长，弃其短，取它适合于中国客观环境之一部而弃其不适合的一部，更没有把它咀嚼消化，加工改造为中国自己的医学。崇拜资本主义的极端化就变为依赖资本主义。各种药品、各种仪器、机械都很少能由自己制造，甚至能修理的人也很少，这是急需克服的。古人说：“上医治国”，一个有良心的医务工作者，他应该日日夜夜为自己的祖国与人民而思虑，他应该想着与大多数人的生命健康有关的问题。我们要使三万人中的每一个的医生都觉悟过来，一心一意为人民服务，这样把医学服务于人民，服务于政治，决不是降低了医学，恰恰相反，这是把“仁术”的原意更明确化，具体化，把医学的地位无限地提高了。也只有这样医学本身才能发展。过去由于我们仅仅只能为少数特权阶级的利益和需要服务，所以四十多年的新医教育过程中，才造就了不到两万医生，这时于少数的上层统治者已经足够，而且供过于求，所以在旧社会里，除去极少数的名医以外，大多数的医务人员是绝对没有前途的。现在反人民的旧政权已被推翻，政权握在人民手中，这个新社会的一切制度设施都是从广大人民的利益出发的，按一千个人一个医生计，中国需要四十五万个医生，那时候不但没有失业的医生，现在在数量上微不足道的医务人员，将被人民当作宝贝一般地尊重和珍惜着。
    科学是广大人民共同劳动的结晶，我们现有的知识技术，都是很多前人劳动的总结，医学只有为人民服务，才能符合医学的道德，否则就是忘本，只有与人民结合，得到广大人民的协助，医学才可能进步，个人才可能发展。
    今天，我国人民正为建设新中国而英勇奋斗，从这里将展现着人类光明的前途。谁要是对现在的政治还抱着漠不关心的态度，实质上就是维护旧社会的黑暗制度。现在民主与反民主的壁垒，是敌我分明的，“不是倒向帝国主义，就是倒向社会主义，绝无例外，中立是伪装的，第三条路是没有的”，但是，“帝国主义者及其走狗中国反动派对于他们在中国这块土地上的失败，是不会甘心的”，最近美国白皮书中提出“民主的个人主义”，就是企图离间中国的知识分子，使我们仍旧一盘散沙，他好分而治之，过去长期接受资本主义教育的医务工作者，尤其应该分别是非，认清帝国主义者的阴谋，一个有正义感的中国人，对这与祖国人民命运攸关的战斗，不应该采取漠不关心的态度！
    现在整个解放区都卷入政治学习的热潮，但是有些医务工作者坚执单纯技术观点，对政治学习是不屑为的，对于这类人，我想作一个比譬：一个人拿一枝枪，他可能是一个土匪，也可能是蒋介石部下的匪军，也可能是人民解放战士，其间的分别只在他是否有政治的认识和为谁服务，同样的，一个有医学技术的人还不能算一个完全的医务工作者，他必须有政治的认识，为人民服务，才能算得一个人民的医务员，如何才能作一个人民的医务员，如何才服务得更好些，首先必得加紧学习，武装自己的头脑，努力改造自己，坚定为人民服务的立场，然后才能成为一个真正的人民的医务员。
