    Xinxiang-Anyang Section Connected
    Masses Donate Materials to Assist in Restoration
    [Xinxiang News] Thanks to the efforts of railway workers and the vast masses along the line, the Xinxiang-Anyang section of the Beijing-Hankou Railway was connected on October 2nd. This section, including sidings, is 115 kilometers long and has 262 bridges of various sizes. Since construction began on August 13th, railway workers have overcome various difficulties, carrying sleepers, lifting rails... Workers in towns along the line hammered spikes, and made fittings, while farmers transported rails and donated materials, without interruption. Finally, on the afternoon of October 2nd, the repair workers from Xinxiang and Anyang victoriously joined forces in Yigou, Tangyin County. Currently, Anyang railway workers are actively rushing to repair locomotives, renovate station buildings along the entire line, and equip station personnel. It is expected that the line will be open to traffic around the 10th of this month.
    [Further News] The masses in southwestern Hebei Province, along the Beijing-Hankou Railway, are enthusiastically donating railway materials to quickly restore the entire line of the Beijing-Hankou Railway. At the end of August, the Handan Special District established a Railway Material Collection Committee, and immediately sent personnel to various places, combining with counties and districts, to strengthen leadership and deepen publicity and mobilization. Under the exemplary influence of Communist Party members and cadres, the masses actively donated materials. The masses on the banks of the Fuyang River sacrificed small interests to serve the overall interests, and automatically dismantled eight bridges built with railway tracks, donating 70 rails. The masses in Dazhongying, Ci County, donated 58 parts. From September 5th, in just 20 days, the special district saw the masses donate more than 3,000 rails and more than 400 other splice plates and other parts. In addition to the fact that various counties are continuing to collect scattered railway materials, there are also 700 rails stored in She County by the former Taihang and Taiyuan Military Region arsenals and paper mills, as well as more than 2,200 rails submerged in the Fuyang River near Matou Town and in the coal mine wells of Ci County, which are also being studied and considered for salvage.
