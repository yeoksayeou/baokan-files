Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 21st — Har Shelirik, a Soviet employee and chief of the Mechanical Section of the Ang'angxi Second Branch of the Qiqihar Railway Administration, recently successfully installed an "automatic air sanding device," which is a major contribution to China's railway construction. Considering that manually sanding locomotives in the past (because locomotives need to sprinkle sand on the rails when going uphill to prevent slipping) was both laborious and slow, and sometimes caused accidents, Har Shelirik, based on his experience, began designing and installing the "automatic air sanding device" in August. After overcoming various difficulties, he finally successfully installed it in mid-September. This type of sander uses a crane to load sand into a dryer for drying (which can dry 20 tons of sand per day), then sends it to a sandblasting box (which can blow one ton per minute), and uses a "wind cylinder" to blow the sand through iron pipes into a sand-leaking box that can hold nine tons of sand (enough for 25 locomotives), which can automatically send sand to the locomotives. Each locomotive stores 330 kilograms of sand, which can be sent in two minutes. It takes 30 minutes with manpower. It also overcomes the phenomenon of sand pipes being blocked by damp sand and the difficulty of manually filling them, which often causes locomotives to run out of sand midway. After the automatic sander was successfully installed, employees of the bureau held a meeting a few days ago to celebrate and presented flowers to Har Shelirik to express their gratitude.

　　对我国铁路建设一大贡献
    东北苏籍铁路职员哈尔谢力装制“空气自动上砂器”成功
    【新华社沈阳二十一日电】齐齐哈尔铁路管理局昂昂溪第二分局苏籍职员机务科长哈尔谢力，最近装制“空气自动上砂器”成功，这是对我国铁路建设的一大贡献。哈尔谢力鉴于过去用人力往机车上砂子（因机车上坡时须用砂子撒在铁轨上，可以防滑），既吃力，又缓慢，有时还要出事故，他根据自己的经验，于八月开始设计装设“空气自动上砂器”，在克服种种困难后，终于九月中旬装造成功。此种上砂器是用吊车将砂子装入干燥机干燥后（每日可干燥砂子二十吨），送入吹砂箱（一分钟可吹一吨），用“风缸”把砂子经铁管吹到能容九吨砂子（供二十五台机车之用）的漏砂箱内，即可自动向机车上送砂。每台机车贮砂量以三百三十公斤计，两分钟即可送完，用人力则须三十分钟，并克服了因砂子潮湿堵塞机车砂管，以及人力难于装满因而往往使机车中途缺砂的现象。自动上砂器装制成功后，该局员工日前曾开会庆祝，纷纷向哈尔谢力献花致谢。
