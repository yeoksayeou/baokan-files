Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 30th -- According to TASS, New York: The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly continued its discussion of the Soviet proposal to save Greek patriots at its meetings on the afternoons of October 25th and 26th. No decision has yet been passed by the meeting. The Soviet proposal has not only gained the support of a considerable number of delegations in the Political Committee, but has also aroused enthusiastic support from progressive American public opinion. On October 25th, a delegation composed of representatives of progressive American labor unions and public groups visited UN General Assembly President Romulo. The delegation requested the United Nations to protect Greek patriots, and in particular to rescue the ten leaders of the Greek Progressive Seamen's Union who had been sentenced to death. The delegation included representatives from local organizations of the American Federation of Teachers, the Electrical Workers Union, the Fur Workers Union, and the Screen Writers Guild. Those who opposed protecting Greek patriots from the brutal Royalist-fascist terror attempted to shorten the discussion and reject the Soviet proposal directly on October 24th, but failed. At the October 25th meeting, they no longer dared to openly defend the Royalist-fascist terror. They pretended to acknowledge the need to eliminate this terror, but at the same time, they contradictorily refused to support the Soviet proposal. The representative of the Athens government attempted to shift the responsibility for the civil war, which was launched with the encouragement and support of the United States and Britain, onto the Greek patriots, and said: The execution of the death penalty has been suspended in Greece; at the same time, he said: A ban on the execution of the death penalty would be of little use. The Ukrainian representative, Manuilsky, immediately exposed the hypocritical tricks of the Athens government representative, saying: "On September 29th, the Polish representative raised the issue of suspending the execution of Taraganis (Zifkos) in the Political Committee. The representatives of El Salvador and Cuba had proposed a motion to stop death penalty sentences. At that time, the representative of the Athens government claimed that an amnesty bill had been submitted to the Greek parliament, and that death penalty sentences would be submitted to the Court of Appeals for review. And the President of the General Assembly, the Philippine representative Romulo, also affirmed that the amnesty mentioned by the Greek representative would be implemented. At a later meeting, the Greek representative insisted that the Athens government had indeed taken "humanitarian" measures aimed at curbing death penalty sentences. Due to this statement by the Greek representative, the representatives of El Salvador and Cuba withdrew their proposals. At a subsequent meeting of the Political Committee, we heard the news: George has been shot in Greece! Zifkos has been sentenced to death again. Is it not an insult that the Political Committee has been deceived by such false guarantees? Here, human rights and freedoms are repeatedly discussed. But today in Greece, precisely now, in October 1949, the most cruel punishments are being used. Defendants, witnesses, and innocent people are subjected to torture. The Political Committee must stop the hands of the executioners. The delegation of the Ukrainian Republic supports the proposal put forward by the Soviet delegation based on humanitarian principles, and requests the Political Committee to support this proposal. I have full moral right to demand this, because I am fortunate to be the representative of one of the republics of that great country that abolished death penalty sentences after the Second World War."

　　营救希腊爱国者　
    联大政委会继续展开讨论　
    苏联建议获重大胜利
    许多代表主张撤消雅典可耻判决
    【新华社北京三十日电】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会政治委员会在十月二十五日及二十六日下午的会议上继续讨论苏联所提拯救希腊爱国者的议案。会议仍未通过决定。苏联的提案不仅在政委会中获得相当多代表团的支持，并且还引起了美国进步舆论的热烈支持。十月二十五日，由美国进步工会及公众团体代表组成的代表团，拜访联合国大会主席罗慕洛。代表团要求联合国保卫希腊的爱国者，并特别营救被宣判死刑的十名希腊进步海员工会的领袖。代表团包括美国教师协会、电气工人工会、皮毛工人工会及电影剧作家协会的当地组织的代表。那些反对保卫希腊爱国者使免于残暴的保皇法西斯恐怖的人们，曾于十月二十四日直接企图缩短讨论并否决苏联的建议，但是失败了。在十月二十五日会议上，他们已不敢冒险公然地为保皇法西斯的恐怖辩护了。他们假意地承认有消灭这种恐怖的必要，但同时却自相矛盾地拒绝支持苏联的建议。雅典政府代表则企图将那因获美英的鼓励与支持而发动起来的内战责任转嫁到希腊爱国者身上，并说：在希腊处决死刑业已中止；同时又说：禁止处决死刑很少会有什么用处。乌克兰代表曼努意斯基当即予雅典政府代表的伪善伎俩以揭发，他说：“在九月二十九日波兰代表就在政治委员会上提出停止处决塔拉甘尼（齐夫哥斯）的问题。萨尔瓦多和古巴代表曾提出了制止死刑判决的议案。当时雅典政府代表声称：大赦法案已向希腊议会提出，并称死刑判决将交上诉法庭复查。而大会主席菲律宾代表罗慕洛也肯定说：希腊代表所说的大赦将会实行。在后来的会议上，希腊代表坚称：雅典政府确已采取了旨在遏止死刑判决的“人道”措施。由于希腊代表的这一声明，萨尔瓦多和古巴的代表便收回了他们的提案。在政治委员会随后的一次会议上，我们便听到几个消息：乔久已在希腊被枪决了！齐夫哥斯再度被判处死刑，政治委员会受到这种虚假保证的欺骗，难道这不是侮辱吗？这里，人权与自由被反复地讨论着。但是今天在希腊，恰恰是现在，在一九四九年十月，却使用着最残酷的刑罚。被告、见证人、无辜的人民都被施以酷刑。政治委员会必须制止刽子手的手。乌克兰共和国代表团支持苏联代表团根据人道主义的原则所提出的提案，而且要求政治委员会支持这个提案。我有着充分的道德上的权利要求这个，因为我很庆幸我是第二次世界大战后取消了死刑判决的那个伟大国家的共和国之一的代表。”
