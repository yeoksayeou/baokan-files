　　Shijingshan Power Plant Experiences Successive Accidents
    Those Responsible Receive Dismissals and Investigations
    North China People's Government Issues Order
    [Our Newspaper's Report] The North China People's Government recently issued the following order regarding the explosion at the No. 6 generator of the Shijingshan Power Plant:
    The Shijingshan Power Plant is the main power plant for the Beijing, Tianjin, and Tangshan areas. Its task is not only to supply electricity to industries and mines and citizens' lighting in and around the capital, but also to assist in the power supply to the industrial areas of Tianjin and Tangshan. However, the plant has experienced a series of serious accidents in recent months. Furthermore, at 17:40 on September 14th, the main No. 6 generator's "Turbine" exploded, suffering severe damage, causing great harm to state property and industrial production. An investigation reveals that the reason for the repeated accidents at the Shijingshan Power Plant is mainly due to the leadership's failure to implement government policies:
    1. Military Representative Li Ping failed to implement the correct instructions of mobilizing the masses, relying on the working class, and uniting the original staff. Therefore, after taking over the old enterprise, he did not carry out appropriate democratic reforms and still maintained the old Kuomintang system. Consequently, the management system and labor discipline are extremely lax or non-existent; at the same time, he did not delve deeply into production, reflecting a serious bureaucratic work style of being divorced from the masses.
    2. Yu Yunhai, the director of the power plant, is the main leading cadre in administration and technology of the power plant. The number and severity of accidents at the Shijingshan Power Plant in recent months are the worst example among power plants in the liberated areas. These serious consequences were caused by the leadership's failure to take any preventive measures before or after the events. Yu Yunhai has been irresponsible for several months, especially in the past two months, residing in Beijing, completely detached from his responsibilities. This is not simply an irresponsible attitude, but an act of sabotage against state property.
    The most fundamental lesson from the Shijingshan accident is the failure to carry out democratic reforms, maintaining the original unreasonable system unchanged for a long time, without mobilizing the masses, relying on the working class, or implementing a policy of uniting the staff. Therefore, it is decided to give Military Representative Li Ping and Director Yu Yunhai the punishment of dismissal from their posts and investigation. The Central Fuel Industry Administration is entrusted to give appropriate punishment to employees who did not fulfill their duties in the No. 6 machine accident, in order to strengthen the staff's sense of responsibility and discipline in production through education.

　　石景山发电厂连续发生事故
    当事人受撤职查办处分
    华北人民政府发布命令
    【本报讯】华北人民政府顷对石景山发电厂六号机发生爆炸事故发布如下命令：
    石景山发电厂为京、津、唐地区之主要发电厂，其任务不仅供给人民首都市内外工矿业及市民照明用电，同时负有补助津、唐工业地区供电任务。但该厂近数月来连续发生严重事故，更于九月十四日十七时四十分钟，发生主力六号发电机“特尔滨”爆炸，遭受严重破坏，给与国家财产及工业生产损害极大。查石景山电厂之所以屡次发生事故，主要是领导上没有执行政府政策所造成：
    一、军代表李平没执行发动群众、依靠工人阶级、团结原来职员的正确指示，因此在接收旧企业后没有进行适当的民主改革，仍保持原国民党旧的一套，因而管理制度、劳动纪律是极端松懈或没有；同时更没有深入到生产中去，是脱离群众的严重官僚主义作风。
    二、发电厂主任于运海是电厂行政与技术的主要领导干部，几个月来石景山电厂事故之多和严重性，是解放区电厂中最坏的典型。造成这些严重的恶果，由于领导上事先事后没采取任何防止措施所造成的。于运海几个月来是不负责任的，特别是近两月来住于北京，完全脱离责任，这不是简单不负责任的态度，而是破坏国家财产的行为。
    石景山事故发生的教训最基本的是没有进行民主改革，与长时期中仍是原封不动，并长期保持了不合理的原制度，没有发动群众，依靠工人阶级，贯彻团结员工的政策。为此决定予军代表李平，主任于运海以撤职查办处分，并委托中央燃料工业处对于六号机事故发生没有尽职的员工给予适当处分，以资加强职工在生产中的专责制和纪律性的生产教育。
