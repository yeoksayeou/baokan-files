Xinhua News Agency, Hami, 22nd. When the People's Liberation Army entered Hami, Xinjiang, Kazakh people from the Tianshan mountain region northwest of Hami and Zhenxi County sent representatives including Wu Shimanfuji, Jianabike, Malasake, Jianabula, Mohabili, and Solun, a total of more than ten people, driving one hundred sheep, trekking more than three hundred li, to Hami to welcome and慰劳 (offer comfort to) the People's Liberation Army. Guo Peng, Commander of a certain army of the People's Liberation Army, Wang Enmao, Political Commissar, Dun Xingqu, Deputy Commander, and others immediately gave them a warm reception. Wu Shimanfuji and others accused the Kuomintang bandit gang of the various oppressions and disasters inflicted on the Kazakh people. They said that the Kazakhs originally scattered around the A'shan area of Xinjiang, living a nomadic life. Thirty years ago, there were very few Kazakhs in the Zhenxi County area with its abundant water and grass. Later, due to the persecution of the bandit leader Sheng Shicai, the Kazakhs from the A'shan area fled to Zhenxi one after another. However, the Kazakhs who moved to Zhenxi still suffered from the looting and massacre by the Kuomintang bandit gang, and had to drive their cattle and sheep to wander in the Qilian Mountains between Qinghai and Gansu. After they arrived in the Qilian Mountains, they discovered that Ma Bufang killed their children and robbed their cattle and sheep just like Sheng Shicai. They said that when the entire Kazakh people heard the news of the People's Liberation Army entering Xinjiang, they were all overjoyed and sincerely grateful to the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army, so they sent them from afar to welcome us.

　　我军进驻新疆哈密时
  　哈族代表远道欢迎
    【新华社哈密二十二日电】人民解放军进驻新疆哈密时，哈密西北天山山区及镇西县哈萨克族人民特派遣乌世满夫极、加拿比克、马拉萨克、加拿布拉、莫哈比立、索伦等十余名代表，赶着一百只羊，跋涉三百余里，至哈密欢迎与慰劳人民解放军。人民解放军某军郭鹏军长、王恩茂政委、顿星去副军长等当即予以热忱招待。乌世满夫极等向人民解放军控诉国民党匪帮统治所给予哈族人民的种种压迫与灾害。他们说，哈萨克族原来散布在新疆阿山一带，过着游牧生活，三十年前在镇西县水草丰盛地带的，只有很少的哈萨克族人，后来由于不堪匪首盛世才的迫害，阿山一带的哈萨克族人才纷纷逃迁镇西。但迁到镇西的哈萨克人，仍然遭受国民党匪帮的抢劫与屠杀，不得不又赶着牛羊流浪到青海和甘肃之间的祁连山中。他们到达祁连山后，发现马步芳和盛世才一样地杀害他们的儿女，抢劫他们的牛羊。他们说，当哈萨克全族人民听到人民解放军进驻新疆的消息后，无不欢欣鼓舞，衷心地感激共产党和人民解放军，所以派他们远道前来欢迎。
