　　The Soviet Social System and National System
    —A Lecture Sponsored by the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association on the Evening of September 13, 1949
    By Zhang Zhongshi
    　　　　I. Social System
    As everyone knows, the Soviet social system is a socialist system. The so-called socialist system is a system where the means of production—land, factories, banks, railways, etc.—are publicly owned, there are no classes, and no exploitation of man by man. Socialism is the first stage of communism. And communism is a society of boundless light, infinite beauty, and the highest ideals for humanity. Humanity's advanced representatives have dreamed of this social system for many years. Under the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party and its leaders Lenin and Stalin, the Soviet people overthrew the rule of the landlords and capitalists in the October Revolution thirty-two years ago, in 1917, abolished the private property system, and established this socialist system. After more than thirty years of intense construction, they have built a glorious socialist society. Now the Soviet Union is gradually moving from socialism to communism. Therefore, in the Soviet Union, there are no more warlords and bureaucrats, no more landlords and capitalists, and no more exploitation of man by man. Society is composed only of workers, peasants, and intellectuals from worker-peasant backgrounds.

    Therefore, the characteristics of Soviet society, that is, its fundamental differences from capitalist society, are as follows:

    First, the public ownership of the means of production. In capitalist society, it is private ownership. The means of production—land, factories, etc.—are privately owned by landlords and capitalists to exploit workers and peasants. In the Soviet Union, after the October Revolution, land, underground mineral resources, water conservancy, forests, mines, factories, banks, state-owned farms, railways, telecommunications, etc., were all nationalized. Later, the constitution explicitly stipulated this point. However, the personal property of every Soviet citizen, such as labor income, savings, housing, household appliances, and daily necessities, is still protected by state law. And the law stipulates that personal property is inheritable, that is, it can be passed on to children, grandchildren, and direct relatives who have lost the ability to work.

    Second, planned economy. In capitalist countries, production is anarchic and unplanned. Because capitalists open factories to make money, they invest wherever there is money to be made. What they produce, how much they produce, or whether they close down, no one can interfere. In the Soviet Union, the entire national economy is operated according to a specific plan. Under the Soviet government, there is a specialized agency—the State Planning Committee—specifically responsible for this planning work. Where to open factories, how much each department or even a certain factory produces, how much raw material is needed, how much the cultivated land area is expanded, and how much livestock is bred are all stipulated in advance. The purpose of the plan is to guarantee the victory of socialism; to continuously increase social wealth and improve people's lives; and to strengthen national defense.

    Third, from each according to his ability, to each according to his work. In capitalist society, landlords and capitalists who own the means of production—land, factories—do not work for a living. In the Soviet Union, it is the opposite, "He who does not work, neither shall he eat." Everyone engages in labor, and labor remuneration is paid according to the quality and quantity of each person's labor. If you work well and produce more, you get more. If you do not work, you get nothing. Therefore, the Soviet constitution stipulates: "From each according to his ability, to each according to his work."

    Because the Soviet Union has eliminated the system of exploitation, workers and peasants are working for themselves and for the whole society. Therefore, the Soviet people are actively engaged in labor and often launch the famous socialist competition, the Stakhanovite movement. Anyone who works hard and contributes to society with their ability is immediately loved and respected throughout the country. Therefore, labor has become an honor and respect in the Soviet Union.

    The Soviet socialist system has many advantages over the capitalist system. It has no economic panic, no unemployment; no class struggle that can develop into armed struggle; its productivity is developing by leaps and bounds every year.

    The experience of Soviet socialist construction has worldwide historical significance. It has proven in practice the correctness of the Marxist-Leninist theory on the laws of social development and the superiority of the socialist economic system.

    　　　　II. National System
    Capitalist countries are states of the dictatorship of the landlords and capitalists. The Soviet state, on the contrary, is a state of the dictatorship of the working class. Its functions are: first, to suppress the resistance of the exploiters, not allowing them to speak or act recklessly; second, to carry out socialist and communist construction; and third, to defend against the aggression of imperialist countries and protect national independence.

    The form of Soviet state power is called the Soviet. Hence the name Soviet state. The so-called Soviet is the People's Representatives Council. It was produced in the 1905 Revolution. After the October Revolution in 1917 overthrew the rule of the landlords and capitalists, it became the organ of power of the proletarian state.

    The Soviet Union's government organs at all levels, whether central or local, are all Soviets. These Soviets are all elected by the entire people. Just as the socialist economy is the economic foundation of Soviet socialist society, the Soviet is the political foundation of Soviet socialist society. Therefore, Soviet society is called Soviet socialist society; the state is called the Soviet socialist state.

    Compared with the state system of bourgeois states, the Soviet state system has the following advantages:

    1. The Soviet is the most mass-based, all-encompassing state organization. Regardless of nationality, race, gender, occupation, party affiliation, education, religion, etc., it can unite all working people. Therefore, it is an organization of the vast majority ruling the tiny minority, the most democratic organization in the world.

    2. The Soviet is a direct organization of the masses themselves. Because it is connected with the broad masses, it is the most prestigious regime among the masses. It enjoys the full trust and love of the people.

    3. The Soviet can enable the broad masses of people to participate in political life and state management. It can select talented people from the masses to serve in administrative, economic, and scientific work. In difficult situations, it can directly call on the masses to help.

    4. The Soviet unites laborers of all nationalities and races, thereby promoting cooperation and unity among all nationalities within the Soviet Union.

    5. It combines legislative and executive powers and replaces electoral districts with production units, linking workers and peasants with state organs.

    6. The Soviet state has created its own people's army, whose commanders are closely connected with the masses. This army suppresses exploiters and defends the interests of the people and national independence.

    Therefore, the Soviet Soviet regime is a new type of state organization, fundamentally different from the old democratic state organization of the bourgeois parliamentary system.

    　　　　III. The Composition of the Soviet Union
    The Soviet Union is a multinational country. There are more than sixty different nationalities within its borders. These nationalities differ in language, customs, history, and level of culture. The people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union have established their own national state organizations according to their own national characteristics.

    The Soviet Union is composed of sixteen Soviet Socialist Republics, hence its name the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, abbreviated as the Soviet Union. These sixteen Soviet Socialist Republics are Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Lithuania, Moldova, Latvia, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Armenia, Turkmenistan, Estonia, and Karelo-Finland. They are combined into union republics.

    Usually, multinational states in capitalist countries, such as Britain, France, the Netherlands, and the United States, are created by forcibly conquering and annexing other nationalities. Conversely, the Soviet Union is formed by the voluntary union of people of all nationalities into a united state. The sixteen union republics that joined it are completely equal. Among them, there is no privileged ruling nationality, and no subordinate oppressed nationality. Each union republic, regardless of which nationality it is composed of, regardless of its population, or how large its territory is, enjoys the same rights as all other union republics. Each union republic retains the right to freely withdraw from the Union, has its own constitution and laws promulgated by the highest state power organ of the republic, retains its own territorial rights, has its own military formation, has its own citizenship, has the right to engage in direct relations with foreign countries, and has its own national emblem and national flag. Therefore, the people of each nationality that joins the Soviet Union enjoy these autonomous rights and feel that they are the masters of their own land.

    In addition, within some union republics, besides the basic residents, some places also have other nationalities residing there. These nationalities account for a minority of the population in these republics and also have their own national characteristics. Therefore, these nationalities also form autonomous republics, autonomous regions, and autonomous districts based on the principle of voluntarism. In the whole Soviet Union, there are sixteen such autonomous republics; nine autonomous regions; and ten autonomous districts.

    The close cooperation among the people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union proves the correctness of Lenin and Stalin's nationality policy.

    　　　　IV. Highest State Power and State Management Organs
    The highest state power organ of the entire Soviet Union is the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.

    The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union is divided into two chambers: the Soviet of the Union and the Soviet of Nationalities.

    Representatives of the Soviet of the Union are elected by all citizens of the entire Soviet Union, with one representative elected for every 300,000 residents. Representatives of the Soviet of Nationalities are elected separately by each union republic, each autonomous republic, each autonomous region, and each autonomous district. Each union republic elects 25 representatives, each autonomous republic elects 11 representatives, each autonomous region elects 5 representatives, and each autonomous district elects 1 representative. The two chambers are equal, and each has the right to raise the issue of formulating new laws and submitting any bill to the Supreme Soviet for review.

    Here is a question: Why does the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union have two chambers, and not one? Because the Soviet Union is a multinational country. Every citizen of the Soviet Union, regardless of nationality and race, has common fundamental interests. The Soviet of the Union represents these common interests of all citizens in the highest state organ. However, the people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union each have their own special interests, each has their own national characteristics, and each has their own language, customs, and culture. The Soviet of Nationalities represents these special interests of the people of all nationalities in the highest state organ.

    This two-chamber system of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union can guarantee that the highest organ of power most fully and effectively expresses the interests of the people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union, and can promote the close cooperation and friendship of the people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union.

    Similarly, each union republic, and each autonomous republic within some union republics, has its own Supreme Soviet—the highest state power organ. The only difference is that these Supreme Soviets are only one-chamber systems.

    The Supreme Soviet of the entire Soviet Union holds plenary sessions twice a year. After the session, the representatives return to their original places to work. In order to handle daily state affairs, it has two organs: one is the Presidium, elected at the joint session of the two chambers; the other is the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, called the Soviet government, which is formed by the chairman of the previous Council of Ministers proposing a list of ministers, which is approved by the joint session of the two chambers of the Supreme Soviet.

    Similarly, the Supreme Soviets of each union republic and autonomous republic also have their own Presidiums and Councils of Ministers.

    All Soviets in the Soviet Union—from the township level to the Supreme Soviet of the entire Soviet Union—are elected on the basis of universal, equal, direct, and secret suffrage. Universal means that all citizens who have reached the age of eighteen, regardless of gender, race and nationality, religious belief, education, origin, residence, property status, and past activities, have the right to participate in elections. Equality means that all citizens can participate in elections according to the same principle, without distinction, and each citizen has only one vote. Direct means that representatives of Soviets at all levels are directly elected by the electors. Secret ballot means that no one should and cannot know who the elector voted for. Therefore, the election law of universal, equal, direct, and secret suffrage is the most democratic and progressive election system in the world.

    Before each election, each agency, enterprise, school, army unit, and village holds an electoral meeting to propose and discuss candidates. Social organizations, workers' organizations, employee congresses in enterprises, collective farms, and village farmers' congresses, army soldiers' congresses, all have the right to nominate candidates. That is, the candidates are nominated by the people themselves. Taking the election of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union in February 1946 as an example, there were a total of 1,339 elected representatives, of whom workers accounted for 38 percent, peasants accounted for 26 percent, and staff and intellectuals accounted for 36 percent. Among them, there were 277 women; 293 were between the ages of 23 and 35. Most of these representatives are labor heroes, combat heroes, and people with the highest prestige among the people. From this, it can be seen who is managing the Soviet Union.

    Summarizing what has been said above, it can be seen that the Soviet socialist society and state are a new type of social system and state system in human history. Facts have proven that this social system and state system are much better than the capitalist social system and state system. The law of social development tells us that all nationalities in the world are bound to move towards this social system. Therefore, we say that the direction of the Soviet Union is the direction that all mankind will take.

　　苏联的社会制度和国家制度
    ——一九四九年九月十三日晚七时在中苏友协主办讲演会上
    张仲实讲
    　　　　一、社会制度
    大家知道，苏联的社会制度是社会主义制度。所谓社会主义制度，就是生产资料——土地、工厂、银行、铁道等等社会公有，没有阶级，没有人剥削人的制度。社会主义是共产主义的第一阶段。而共产主义是人类的无限光明，无限美妙，最高理想的社会。人类的先进代表者梦想这种社会制度已有很多年了。苏联人民，在苏联共产党及其领袖列宁和斯大林领导之下，于三十二年前即一九一七年十月革命的结果，曾推翻了地主资本家的统治，废除了私有财产制度，建立了这社会主义制度。经过了三十余年的紧张建设工作，他们已经建设成了一个光辉灿烂的社会主义社会。现在苏联正由社会主义逐渐进到共产主义。所以，在苏联，已经没有军阀官僚，没有地主资本家，没有人剥削人的事情了，社会只是由工人，农民及工人农民出身的知识分子构成的。
    因此，苏联社会的特征，即它与资本主义社会的基本区别，有以下几点：
    第一是生产资料公有制。在资本主义社会里，是私有制。生产资料——土地、工厂等均为地主、资本家私人占有，用以剥削工人农民。在苏联，在十月革命后，就把土地、地下矿藏、水利、森林、矿井、工厂、银行、国营农场、铁道、电信事业等，都收归国家所有。后来宪法更明确规定了这一点。但是苏联每个公民个人所有的财产，如劳动收入、储蓄、住屋、家庭用具及日常用品，仍受国家法律的保护，并且法律规定，个人财产有继承权，即可遗传给本人儿女、孙儿女及失去工作能力的直属亲支。
    第二是计划经济。在资本主义国家里，生产是无政府的，无计划的。因为资本家开办工厂，是为了赚钱，那里有钱可赚，他就向那里投资。他要生产什么，生产多少，或者关门大吉，谁也不能过问。在苏联，全部国民经济是根据一定计划经营的。苏联政府之下设有专门机关——国家计划委员会，专门主持这个计划工作。在什么地方开办什么工厂；那一部门乃至某一工厂生产多少，需要多少原料；耕地面积扩大多少，牲畜繁殖多少，事前都规定好了。计划的目的，一是在保证社会主义的胜利；二是不断增加社会财富，改善人民生活；三是加强国防。
    第三是各尽所能，按劳付酬。在资本主义社会里，占有生产资料——土地、工厂的地主资本家是不劳而食的。在苏联，适为相反，“不劳动者不得食”。人人都从事劳动，劳动的报酬是按每人劳动的质量和数量来付给的。你工作的好，生产的多，你就得的多。你不工作，就一无所得。所以，苏联宪法规定：“各尽所能，按劳付酬”。
    因为苏联已消灭了剥削制度，工人农民都是为了自己，为了全社会而劳动的，所以，苏联人民都积极从事劳动，在工作中常常展开有名的社会主义竞赛、斯泰汉诺夫运动。谁只要努力工作，以其所能献给社会，他就立刻受到全国的热爱，敬重。故劳动在苏联已成了一种荣誉、尊敬。
    苏联社会主义制度比之资本主义制度，有好多优越性。它没有经济恐慌，没有失业；没有可以发展到武装斗争的阶级斗争；它的生产力每年都是突飞猛进地向前发展的。
    苏联社会主义建设的经验，有全世界历史的意义。它在实践上证明了马列主义关于社会发展规律学说之正确，证明了社会主义经济制度之优越性。
    　　　　二、国家制度
    资本主义国家是地主资本家专政的国家。苏联的国家，正好相反，是工人阶级专政的国家。其职能一是镇压剥削者的反抗，不许剥削者乱说乱动；二是进行社会主义和共产主义建设；三是防御帝国主义国家的侵犯保卫国家的独立。
    苏联国家政权的形式，叫做苏维埃。故称苏维埃国家。所谓苏维埃，就是人民代表会议。它是在一九○五年革命中产生的，在一九一七年十月革命推翻地主资本家的统治以后，它就成了无产阶级国家的政权机关。
    苏联各级政权机关，不论中央的或地方的，都是苏维埃。这些苏维埃都是由全体人民选举出来的。正如社会主义经济是苏联社会主义社会的经济基础一样，苏维埃是苏联社会主义社会的政治基础。故苏联社会叫做苏维埃社会主义社会；国家叫做苏维埃社会主义国家。
    苏维埃国家制度，与资产阶级国家制度比较，有以下优点：
    一、苏维埃是一种最群众化的包揽一切的国家组织，它不分民族，种族，性别，职业，党派，教育，宗教等等，可以把一切劳动人民联合起来。故它是极大多数人统治极少数人的组织，是世界上最民主的组织。
    二、苏维埃是群众本身的直接的组织，因与广大群众相联系，它是在群众中最有威望的政权，它享有人民群众的充分信任和爱护。
    三、苏维埃可以使广大人民群众参加政治生活和国家管理工作。它可以从群众中选拔有才干的人担任行政、经济、科学工作。在困难的场合，可以直接号召群众起来予以帮助。
    四、苏维埃把各民族和种族劳动者联合起来，从而，它就可以促进苏联境内各民族的合作和团结。
    五、它把立法权和行政权结合起来，并以生产单位代替选举区，使工人和农民同国家机关联系起来。
    六、苏维埃国家创造了自己的人民的军队，其指挥人员是与人民群众血肉相联的。这种军队是镇压剥削者保卫人民利益和国家独立的。
    所以，苏联苏维埃政权是一种新类型的国家组织，它在原则上是与资产阶级国会制的旧民主主义国家组织完全不同的。
    　　　　三、苏联的构成
    苏联是一个多民族的国家。它的境内有六十多个不同的民族。这些民族的语言、风俗、历史、文化程度，各不相同。苏联各族人民，都按照自己民族的特点，成立了自己的民族国家的组织。
    苏联是由十六个苏维埃社会主义共和国组成的，故它叫做苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟，简称苏联。这十六个苏维埃社会主义共和国就是俄罗斯、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、乌芷别克、卡萨克、乔治亚、亚才拜疆、立陶宛、莫尔达维亚、拉脱维亚、吉尔吉斯、达吉克、亚美尼亚、土克曼、爱沙尼亚、卡列芬兰。它们合为加盟共和国。
    通常资本主义国家的多民族的国家，如英国、法国、荷兰、美国，是用武力征服和并吞其他民族而造成的。反之苏联是由各族人民自愿联合的办法，组成一个联盟国家。加入它的十六个加盟共和国是完全平等的，它们之中没有享有特权的占统治地位的民族，没有被隶属的被压迫的民族。每个加盟共和国，不管它是由那民族构成的，不管它的人口有多少，它的领土有多末大，都享有与其他一切加盟共和国同样的权利。每个加盟共和国都保留有自由退出联盟之权，都有本共和国最高国家政权机关所颁布的宪法和法律，都保存有自己的领土权，都有自己的军队编制，都有自己的公民籍，都有权与外国发生直接的关系，都有自己的国徽和国旗。因此，加入苏联的每个民族的人民，享有这些自主权，都感到自己是自己国土上的主人翁。
    另外，有些加盟共和国的境内，除基本居民外，某些地方还住有其他民族，这些民族在这些共和国内占人口少数，也有本民族的特点。因此，这些民族又根据自愿原则，组成自治共和国、自治州、自治府。就全苏联说，这种自治共和国共有十六个；自治州共有九个；自治府共有十个。
    苏联境内各族人民的亲睦合作，证明了列宁和斯大林民族政策的正确。
    　　　　四、最高国家政权和国家管理机关
    全苏联最高国家政权机关是苏联最高苏维埃。
    苏联最高苏维埃分两院：一为联盟院，一为民族院。
    联盟院的代表，是由全苏联一切公民选举的，每三十万居民选代表一人。民族院的代表，是由各加盟共和国、各自治共和国、各自治州、各自治府分别选举的。每个加盟共和国选二十五名，每个自治共和国选十一人，每个自治州选五人，每个自治府选一人。两院是平等的，每个都有权提出制定新法律的问题和把任何法案提交最高苏维埃审查。
    这里有一个问题，为什么苏联最高苏维埃要分两院，而不是一院？因为苏联是多民族的国家。苏联每个公民，不分民族和种族，都有共同的基本的利益。联盟院就是在国家最高机关里代表一切公民的这种共同利益的。但是苏联各族人民各有各的特殊利益，各有各的民族特点，各有各的语言、风俗与文化。民族院就是在国家最高机关内代表各族人民的这些特殊利益的。
    苏联最高苏维埃的这种两院制度，就可以保证最高政权机关最圆满最切实地表现苏联各族人民的利益，可以促进苏联各族人民的亲睦合作和友好。
    同样，每个加盟共和国，及有些加盟共和国内的每个自治共和国都有自己的最高苏维埃——最高国家权力机关。所不同的只是这些最高苏维埃只是一院制而已。
    全苏联最高苏维埃一年开全体会议两次，闭会后各代表即返回原地工作。为了处理日常国事，它设有两个机关，一是主席团，由两院联席会议上选出；一是苏联部长会议，叫作苏联政府，由前届部长会议主席提出各部部长名单，经最高苏维埃两院联席会议批准。
    同样，各加盟共和国和自治共和国最高苏维埃也都设有自己的主席团和部长会议。
    苏联一切苏维埃——从乡级起到全苏联最高苏维埃止，都是根据普遍、平等、直接、秘密投票的选举权选出的。所谓普遍，是说凡年满十八岁的公民，不分男女，不分种族和民族，不分宗教信仰、教育出身、居住、财产状况、过去活动，都有权参加选举。所谓平等，是说一切公民，根据同等原则，没有差别，都可以参加选举，每个公民只有一张选票。所谓直接，是说各级苏维埃代表都是由选举人直接选出的。所谓秘密投票，是说任何人都不应当而且不能知道选举人是投了谁的票。所以，普遍、平等、直接、秘密投票的选举法是世界上最民主最进步的选举制度。
    在每次选举之前，每个机关、企业、学校、部队、乡村，都举行选举人大会，提出和讨论候选人。社会团体、劳动者组织、企业中职工大会，集体农场及村镇农民大会，部队军人大会，都有权提出候选人。就是候选人是由人民群众自己提出的。以一九四六年二月苏联最高苏维埃选举说，当选代表共一、三三九名，其中工人占百分之三十八，农民占百分之二十六，职员、知识分子占百分之三六。其中妇女有二七七人；年龄从二十三岁起到三十五岁的有二九三人。这些代表中大半是劳动英雄、战斗英雄以及在人民群众中有最高威信的人。从这里可以看出，苏联是由什么人在管理着。
    总括以上所说的，可以看到，苏联的苏维埃社会主义社会和国家是人类历史上新型的社会制度和国家制度。事实已经证明，这种社会制度和国家制度，要比资本主义的社会制度和国家制度好的多。社会发展规律告诉我们，全世界一切民族都必然要走到这种社会制度的。所以，我们说，苏联的方向就是全人类要走的方向。
