　　Northeast Sanitary Materials Factory Improves Technology
  　Finished Product Quality Improves
  　Motors and Other Factories Produce Inferior Self-Flowing Products
    [Report from this newspaper] The Northeast Sanitary Materials Factory in Shenyang has paid attention to improving the quality of absorbent cotton, gauze, and bandages, and has achieved results. According to the factory's past production of absorbent cotton, not only was the water absorption low, but it also contained black spots; the gauze and bandages also had uncut sections, low quality, and did not meet standards. After the general factory pointed out these problems, the factory immediately convened a joint meeting of the Factory Management Committee, technical personnel, and work group leaders to study the issue. Initially, some comrades believed that the raw materials were poor, so the product quality was naturally low. However, after repeated research, it was felt that the fact that the gauze and bandages were not cut had nothing to do with the raw materials; the slow water absorption of absorbent cotton must be due to insufficient degreasing, and the poor raw materials should not be emphasized alone. Finally, technical personnel used the same raw materials for testing, and the results proved that the slow water absorption of absorbent cotton was due to inappropriate boiling time and heat, and abnormal proportions of caustic soda, sulfuric acid, and bleaching powder, which made it difficult to neutralize, so the fat in the raw cotton was not easily removed. Based on this fact, the work group leaders all seriously reviewed their own work and resolved to establish a system of responsibility for each group to ensure that the size of absorbent cotton, gauze, and bandages would meet standards in the future, and the quality would also be improved. After this meeting, the absorbent cotton produced by the factory not only has a large and fast water absorption capacity, but the pigment is also particularly white; the absorbent cotton and bandages are cut neatly and the size is very accurate, and the quality of the products has been greatly improved.
    [Report from this newspaper] Northeast Daily News: The motor factory and the Third Bureau of Military Supplies and other factories affiliated to the Northeast Electrical Industry Administration, due to the lack of meticulous planning and strict inspection systems in production, as well as emphasizing production quantity and neglecting product quality, have caused serious waste in production. The planning section of the motor factory did not operate carefully in drafting, resulting in most of the products not meeting standard specifications. For example, in the manufacture of large-scale knitting machines, seven became waste products from wooden molds to casting, consuming 807 man-hours. The machine factory of the Third Bureau of Military Supplies only emphasized output and did not pay attention to quality, resulting in some products not meeting standards, insufficient fire resistance, and not durable for use; and some of the finished products sold were returned. The factories have now begun to pay attention to this serious phenomenon and are actively trying to overcome and improve it.

　　东北卫生材料厂改进技术
  　成品质量提高
  　电机等厂生产自流产品低劣
    【本报讯】沈阳东北卫生材料厂注意改进药棉药布和绷带的质量，已获得成绩。按该厂过去所产药棉，不但吸水量小，且杂有黑点；药布和绷带中亦有未切断、质量低、不合标准等现象。这种现象经总厂指出后，厂方即召开了工厂管理委员会、技术人员和各工作组长联席会进行研究。起初一部分同志认为：原料不好，产品质量当然就低。后经大家反复研究，觉得药布和绷带没有切断，与原料没有关系；药棉吸水慢，一定是脱脂不够，不应单独强调原料不好。最后，经由技术员仍用同一原料试验结果，证明药棉吸水分慢，是因为煮棉的火力和时间不适当，使用火碱、硫酸、漂粉的比例数量不正常，不容易起中和作用，故原棉的脂肪质不易脱掉。根据这种事实，各工作组长均联系自己工作情形认真作了检讨，决议确立各组负责制度，保证今后药棉、药布和绷带的尺码要合标准，而且质量还要提高。经此会议后，现该厂所产药棉不但吸水分大而且快，色素也特别白；药棉、绷带，切的既整齐，尺码又极准确，产品的质量提高很多。
    【本报讯】东北日报消息：东北电器工业管理局所属电机厂、军需三局等厂，由于生产无周密计划与严格检查制度，以及强调生产数量，忽视产品质量，致使生产中发生严重浪费现象。电机厂计划科，制图操作不周密，使大部产品不合标准规格。如制造大型编织机，从木型到翻砂就有七台成了废品，耗废人工八百零七个。军需三厂机造厂，只强调产量，不注意质量，致部分产品不合标准，沾火强度不够，使用不耐久；且卖出去的成品，有的被退回来。现各厂已开始注意这一严重现象，积极想法克服改进中。
