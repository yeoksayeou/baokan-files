　　Long Live the Eastern Peace Fortress!
  　 A Record of the China Conference for the Defense of World Peace
    On the second day that the People's Republic of China rose like the sun in the East, all the people of Beijing, together with the people of China and the world, declared to all honest people on earth our determination to defend human peace. All imperialist warmongers will tremble even more at the sound of the radio waves emanating from Beijing. A few days ago, the birth of New China was proclaimed here, and today the outstanding representatives of the Chinese people are holding a conference here to defend world peace.
    In the center of the venue, in the front rows of a row of seats, sat the delegation of our great friendly neighbor, the Soviet Union, and the representative of Italy, distinguished guests of New China. Portraits of Stalin and Mao Zedong were hung high on the stage, and Picasso's famous painting of a dove radiated the light of peace from the rostrum. Outside the red walls of Zhongnanhai, teams of workers and students were beating drums and gongs with a deafening sound, singing heartily for New China, for people's democracy, and for lasting peace.
    At this most sublime moment, we recall the arduous path the Chinese people have traversed in the past three decades. For almost all of that time, we have lived in war. Millions of comrades and brothers have given their blood and lives. What was it for? It was to strive for the people's peace, to build a beautiful New China. Every Chinese person hopes to live in freedom, creating happiness with their own hands. Even this most basic human demand was not allowed by the imperialist aggressors and the counter-revolutionary bandits, who wanted to take up knives to slaughter us. The heroic Chinese people are not sheep. We armed ourselves and fought a long and courageous armed struggle against the counter-revolutionaries. However, the people are inherently lovers of peace, just as Comrade Lin Boqu, who has experienced half a century of revolutionary struggle, said in his opening speech at this conference: "The Chinese people have experienced long years of war and know the cruelty of war. We resolutely support peace and oppose war!"
    In the great cause of striving for peace in the past three decades, in those darkest and most brutal years, our hearts were tightly linked with the great peace-loving people of the Soviet Union. We longed for the day when we could stand shoulder to shoulder with our Soviet comrades and brothers without hindrance to defend world peace.
    This simple and great desire has now been realized through our tireless struggle. In this very venue, the outstanding sons and daughters of the Soviet state have come with equally warm hearts and spoken here.
    This is the voice of Simonov: "Striving for peace is not an easy task, and therefore it must have perseverance, courage, and determination. Have we two great peoples—the Chinese and Soviet peoples—not been persevering enough in the struggle? Have our two peoples not demonstrated the highest examples of heroism in the world?..."
    Fadeyev made the most sublime declaration of friendship before a crowd of 300,000 people: "The Soviet people will devote all their strength to helping the Chinese people with the greatest strength."
    During the conference, people shouted "Long live the Soviet Union, the world's powerful peace fortress!" and "Long live China, the newly born and powerful Eastern peace fortress!" again and again! They shouted "Long live Stalin and Mao Zedong!" again and again! The band repeatedly played music filled with this vigorous confidence and boundless emotion, and waves of applause erupted again and again.
    At 11:30 a.m., the Korean delegation, arriving with the friendship and aspirations for defending peace of 30 million people, entered the venue amidst cheers and continuous applause.
    Listen, the working people of Italy are speaking here. This is the voice of Spano: "...In our country, the forces of peace are greater than the forces of war. The working people of Italy have understood that in order to defend peace, the forces of war must be eliminated... Thank you for the great cause you have undertaken for yourselves, for the Italian people, and for the people of the world! Long live the friendship between the People's Republic of China and the great Soviet Union!"
    This outstanding representative of the Italian people finally shouted in Chinese: "Long live New China!"
    When the Korean delegate, Park Jeong-ae, shouted, "Long live the solidarity between the Korean and Chinese people!" we saw that the day of liberation for the people of the Far East and the world's colonies and semi-colonies from the shackles of imperialism was about to arrive.
    We have joined the powerful ranks of peace-loving people all over the world, and our huge roar of defending peace will be heard in every corner of the earth. History has changed the year, and Asia, which has always been regarded as backward, now stands tall as a vibrant and infinitely promising Eastern peace fortress. On October 2, 1949, the heart of New China—Beijing—representing the will of the people of the whole country, swore here: "Defend people's democracy and safeguard world peace!"

　　东方和平堡垒万岁！
  　 记中国保卫世界和平大会
    当中华人民共和国如旭日高升出现在世界东方的第二天，全北京人民与全中国全世界人民在一起，向地球上一切正直的人们宣告了我们保卫人类和平的决心。一切帝国主义的战争贩子们，将在从北京发出去的电波声音中，更加颤栗起来。前几天，在这里宣告了新中国的诞生，今天中国人民的优秀代表，又在这里举行保卫世界和平大会。
    会场正中一列席位的前数排坐着新中国的贵宾伟大友邦苏联的代表团和意大利的代表，斯大林和毛泽东的画像高悬台上，毕加索的名画鸽子从主席台上放射着和平的光辉。在中南海红色的围墙外，一队又一队的工人们学生们正敲打着震天的锣鼓，为新中国为人民民主和持久和平纵情高歌。
    就在这最崇高的时刻里，我们回想起近三十年来中国人民所经历过的艰巨道路，三十年中几乎全部时间我们是生活在战争中，成百万同志和兄弟付出了自己的鲜血和生命，这是为了什么？是为了争取人民的和平，为了建设一个美好的新中国。每一个中国人民都希望能生活在自由的用自己的双手创造幸福的日子里。就连这一点人类最本分的要求，帝国主义侵略者和反革命的匪帮们也不容许，要拿起刀来屠杀，英雄的中国人民不是绵羊，我们武装起来，长期的英勇的和武装的反革命搏斗。然而人民是和平的天性爱好者，正如经历过半个世纪革命斗争的林伯渠同志在这个大会的开幕词中所说：“中国人民经历过长期战争，深知战争的残酷，我们坚决拥护和平，反对战争！”
    在近三十年的为争取和平的伟大事业中，在那些最黑暗最残酷的岁月里，我们的心紧紧地和伟大的爱好和平的苏联人民联结在一起。我们憧憬着有这样一天，我们能够毫无阻碍的肩并肩和苏联的同志和弟兄站在一块保卫世界和平。
    这个朴素的伟大的愿望，由于我们不倦地斗争现在实现了。就在这个会场中，苏维埃国家的优秀子弟带着同样热烈的心情来了，在这里讲话了。
    这是西蒙诺夫的声音：“争取和平不是一件容易的事情，因此必须要有坚忍、勇敢、毅力。难道我们这两个伟大的人民——中国和苏联人民——在斗争中还不够坚忍吗？难道我们两国人民还没有表现出世界上最高的英勇的范例吗？……”
    法捷耶夫在三十万群众面前作了最崇高的友谊的宣示：“苏联人民对于中国人民将尽其所有力量，用最大力量帮助他。”
    在会议进行中，人们一次又一次的为世界上强大的和平堡垒苏联，为东方新生而强大的和平堡垒中国高呼万岁！为斯大林和毛泽东高呼万岁！乐队一次又一次地为这种旺盛的信心无穷的情绪高高奏起，海浪似的掌声一次又一次的沸腾。
    上午十一点三十分，带着三千万人民友谊与保卫和平的壮志而来的朝鲜代表团，在欢呼与不绝的鼓掌中进入会场了。
    你听听，意大利劳动人民在这里说话了，这是斯巴诺的声音：“……在我们国家中和平的力量大于战争的力量。意大利的劳动人民已经懂得：为了保卫和平，就得消灭战争的力量……感谢你们为你们自己也为意大利人民为全世界人民所作的伟大事业！中华人民共和国和伟大苏联的友好万岁！”
    这个意大利人民的优秀代表最后用中国语高呼：“新中国万岁！”
    朝鲜代表团朴正爱在她高呼“朝中人民团结万岁！”时，我们看到远东和全世界殖民地半殖民地人民，从帝国主义桎梏下解放的日子就要到来。
    我们已经加入了全世界爱好和平人民的强大行列，我们保卫和平的巨大吼声，将传到地球的每个角落。历史已经变了年号，从来被人目为落后的亚洲，现在已经屹立起一座朝气勃勃前途无限的东方和平堡垒。一九四九年十月二日，新中国的心脏——北京，代表着全国人民的意志在这里宣誓：“保卫人民民主，维护世界和平！”
