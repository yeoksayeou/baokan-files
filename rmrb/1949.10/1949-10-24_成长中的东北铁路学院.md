The Growing Northeast Railway Institute
China Jiaotong University, Beijing Management Institute Zhù Yìxīn
After completing our internship in Harbin, we visited the Northeast Railway Institute on September 22nd to observe, learn, and gather experience as a reference for reforming the academic system and learning methods after returning to school. We were honored to have the heads of various departments of the institute introduce the progress made over the past three years.

Since the People's Liberation Army liberated Northern Manchuria and the people began to have railways, the Railway Workers' School was established in October 1946 to strengthen the ideological training of railway workers and establish their perspective of serving the people. At that time, only on-site employees were selected for training, and no new students were recruited. Later, due to the urgent need for railway personnel, the school was expanded and renamed the Northeast Railway Institute, divided into: train operations, engineering, telecommunications, materials, accounting, and station operations classes. The students included young employees from the field and newly recruited young students. This allowed employees with practical experience and students with cultural knowledge to exchange their strengths. Since last year, the revolutionary situation has continued to develop, and the railway lines have been extended. A large number of employees outside the customs were transferred to inside the customs, making it difficult to select employees from the field. Therefore, most of the students recruited young students from various places, adopting a crash training method, and they could graduate after one year of study. In the past three years, 1,500 students have been trained and distributed to various parts of the Northeast Railway. The students fought against the old system in their work and created a labor insurance system. They played a certain role in various movements and completed their specific tasks. In the past six months, hundreds of students have responded to the call of "where the army fights, the railway is built," following the People's Liberation Army and repairing railways in a timely manner, completing the great transportation task of supporting the front lines.

Combining Practical Learning, Moving the Classroom to the Field
The institute currently has more than 1,000 students and 52 teachers. In terms of teaching, it completely broke away from the previous unrealistic teaching methods and adopted a scientific method of "listening," "seeing," and "doing" simultaneously. First, general principles are explained in the classroom. Then, students visit the site of whatever section was just covered in class, and then return to school to discuss together if there is anything they do not understand, so that what they have learned can be understood clearly. In this way, participating in on-site work is naturally easier to grasp. At the same time, this step-by-step teaching method enables the practical and the theoretical to be effectively combined. In the two months before our visit to the institute, some classes moved the classroom to the field according to actual needs, and teachers gave on-the-spot explanations of the project in progress. Teachers and students ate and lived on site. This accelerated the progress of learning and helped students' understanding.

Implementing Teaching Responsibility System to Ensure Teaching and Learning
In order to increase teaching efficiency, the school implemented a teaching responsibility system. That is, the teacher guarantees to teach the students, and those who teach well are praised by the school; if they do not teach well, they are criticized by the school. Therefore, in order to complete the teaching task, some teachers sacrificed their rest time and taught students outside of class.

On the student side, they must also ensure that they learn. For this reason, the students formed mutual learning groups. The group system adopted a system suitable for the objective environment of each period. Their groups had successively adopted a two-person responsibility system: that is, two people in a group, one with a higher level of education and one with a lower level, so that the strong taught the weak. In this way, not only did the stronger have to ensure that they learned well, but also to ensure that the weaker learned well. Secondly, a three-three responsibility system was also tried: that is, three people formed a group, divided into upper, middle, and lower levels, so that the good taught the average, and the average taught the bad. However, both of these systems had biases: those with a lower level of education had a psychology of reliance, not studying hard, and also affecting the upward progress of others. However, these two mutual learning methods were suitable at the time because the students' cultural levels were uneven, the revolutionary situation developed rapidly, and the students' enthusiasm for learning was high, and considerable results were achieved. For example, Cheng Jidong, a 16-year-old student, only scored 45 points in the exam before the two-person responsibility system was implemented, but after implementation, the score reached 91 points. Now they have changed the way of forming groups, putting those with similar levels in a group, so that they can all make progress in discussion and research. However, it seems difficult to avoid having students with poor levels in the group, so a "little teacher" system has been adopted, that is, students with good grades in the group should try their best to help those with poor grades; students with poor grades can ask good students at any time; so that problems can be solved in a timely manner.

In addition to tense study, students often hold parties and sports meetings. Most of the programs and sports methods they perform are combined with what they have actually learned. For example, the train operations group, in sports competitions, performed train marshalling and shunting. When singing and acting, they compiled the content of vehicle allocation and train marshalling into songs or dramas to perform. In this way, extracurricular activities are combined with business studies, which is not only entertaining, but also has unexpected effects on business studies.

Although the time for business studies is very short, students actively participate whenever the government calls or in various movements. Everyone participated in movements such as building airports and the Eight Districts Park, and they all worked very hard. For example, when repairing the airport, female student Sun Muzhen's eyes were very swollen, but she was still unwilling to lag behind and wanted to participate in the work.

In terms of group activities, in addition to the student union, there are also Party and League branches. The main task of the League is to cooperate with and guarantee the completion of the student union's calls and promote various movements. In various movements, many activists have emerged, and some have gloriously joined the League. In June of last year, there were only 300 League members, but in the past year, it has grown to 800. Among these League members, 110 have gloriously joined the Communist Party of China. Among many graduates, the students who are the most responsible and willing to work are mostly Party and League members. From here, we can see again that under the correct leadership and cultivation of the Party, Party and League members, whether in school or after graduation, continue to give play to their creativity and initiative, and play a certain leading role in railway construction.

The Northeast Railway Institute will gradually move from the nature of a short-term training class to a standardized road with the development of the situation and the needs of the revolution!

　　成长中的东北铁路学院
    中国交通大学、北京管理学院  祝怿新
    我们在哈尔滨实习结束后，为了观摩学习，吸取经验，作为返校后改革学制及学习方法的参考起见，在九月二十二日参观了东北铁路学院，并承该院各部负责人介绍了三年来奋斗的经过情形。
    自解放军解放了北满，人民开始有铁路起，为了加强铁路职工的思想训练，确立他们为人民服务的观点，于一九四六年十月成立了铁路职工学校。当时仅抽调现场员工加以训练，不另招收新生。后因铁路需要人员且急，学校随之扩大，改成东北铁路学院，分成：车务、工务、电务、材料、会计、站务诸班。学员有来自现场的青年员工和新招的青年学生。这样，使有实际经验的员工与具有文化知识的学生相互交流所长。去年以来，革命形势不断发展，铁路线随之延长，关外大批员工调至关内，现场抽调员工不易，于是大部分的学员乃招收来自各地的青年学生，采取突击的训练方式，学习一年即可毕业。三年来，培养了一千五百名学员，分布在东北铁路的各部分。学员们在工作中与旧制度斗争，创建了劳动保险制度，在各种运动中，他们起了一定的作用，完成了他们一定的任务。近半年来，有成百的学员随革命形势的开展，响应“军队打到那里，铁路修到那里”的号召，紧跟着解放军前进，及时地修复铁路，完成了支援前线伟大的运输任务。
    结合实际学习课堂移至现场
    该院现有学员千余人，教员五十二名。在教学方面，完全打破以前不切合实际的教学方法，而采用了“听”、“看”、“做”三样同时进行的科学方法。先在课堂上讲解了一般原理，讲那部分便到现场去参观那部分，再回校共同研究一下，是否还有不懂得的，使所学的能弄个明白。这样以后，参加现场工作自然容易掌握；同时，这样有步骤地进行教学，使理论与实际能切实结合。在我们参观该院的前两月，还有些班级随事实上的需要而将课堂移至现场，教员对着正在进行的工程当场讲解。师生食宿都在现场。如此，增快了学习的进度，帮助了同学的了解。
    为了增进教学效率起见，在学校里实行了教学负责制。即是先生保证把学生教会，教得成绩好的受到学校表扬；假使教得不好的则受到学校的批评。因此，为了完成教学任务，有的教员便牺牲了自己休息的时间，在课外来教授学生。
    实行教学负责制保证教会、学会
    同学方面，也得保证自己学会，为此同学们自己组成了互助学习小组。小组的制度依各个时期客观环境的不同而采用适合于当时的制度。他们小组曾先后采用过二人负责制：即二人一小组，一个文化程度较高的与一个较差的编篇一组，使强的教差的，这样，不但程度强的要保证自己学的好，还要保证差的也学的好。其次还试行过三三负责制：即三人组成一组，分为上、中、下三种程度，使好的教次的，次的教坏的。但是以上两种制度都发生过偏向：文化程度较差的存有依靠的心理，自己不好好学习，还影响别人向上的进展。不过这两种互助学习方法，在当时由于同学间文化程度不齐，革命形势发展很快，同学学习的情绪很高，这样作是适合的，曾收到了相当的效果。如十六岁的小同学程吉栋在未实行二人负责制前，考试成绩仅四十五分，实行后成绩竟达到九十一分。现在他们改换了编小组的方式，将程度差不多的编在一组，使互相在讨论研究中都能得到进步。但组内似乎还难避免有程度差的，所以又采用了小先生制，即小组中成绩好的要尽量帮助差的，差的同学可随时去请问好的；使问题能及时得到解答。
    学员们除了很紧张的学习之外，经常举行联欢晚会、运动会，他们所演的节目和运动方式，大多数是结合实际所学的。象车务组，他们在体育竞赛时，便表演编车、调车。在唱歌演剧时，他们便把配车、编车的内容编成歌或剧来演唱。这样，课外活动结合业务学习，不但能娱乐，而且收到业务学习上的意外效果。
    虽然业务学习的时间很短，但他们每遇政府的号召或各种运动时，同学们都踊跃的参加。象修建机场、八区公园等运动，大家都参加了，并且都很努力。如修机场时，女同学孙慕真眼睛肿得很厉害，她还不甘落后，要去参加工作。
    团体活动方面，除学生会外，还有党、团支部。团的主要工作是配合并保证完成学生会的号召，推动各种运动。在各种运动中，涌现出了不少的积极分子，有的光荣地参加了团。去年六月，仅有三百名团员，一年来已发展到八百名，这些团员中现已有一百一十名光荣地加入了中国共产党。许多毕业的同学中，工作最负责最肯干的同学，大多数是党、团员。从这里我们又可以看出来，党、团员在党的正确领导与培养下，无论在学校或毕业出去，都不断地发挥了他们的创造性和积极性，在铁路建设中起了它一定推动的骨干作用。
    东北铁院，它将随形势的发展，革命的需要，日渐由短期训练班的性质向着正规化的道路迈进！
