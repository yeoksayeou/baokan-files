　　Improve Product Quality, Save Raw Materials!
    Now, in our vast territory, it would be difficult to find an enterprise where there are no followers of Alexander Chutkykh (Stalin Prize winner, assistant technician of the "Red Ridge Wool Textile United Factory"). Hundreds of thousands of people are participating in the active struggle to improve the quality of finished products.
    It is enough to mention the following: in the light industry sector alone, about 27,000 production groups and more than 300,000 male and female workers are participating in the competition to manufacture high-quality products. Not only in a few individual enterprises, but also generally in many departments of the Soviet Ministry of Light Industry, the manufacture of first-class products has greatly increased.
    In the machine manufacturing industry, metallurgical industry, food industry, and other industrial sectors, the number of participants in this competition is growing day by day.
    The significance of this fact for the national economy is immeasurable. The extraordinary enthusiasm and creative fervor of the broad masses supporting Alexander Chutkykh's initiative is a most vivid expression of the working people's high socialist consciousness, their sincere Soviet patriotism, and their tireless efforts to increase the glory and power of their beloved motherland.
    In the situation where socialist industry has surpassed pre-war production levels and is rapidly moving towards new victories, quality indicators of work are beginning to have increasing significance. Every enterprise can and should fulfill its plan not only in quantity, but also in the variety and quality of finished products. Manufacturing the best products in the world and more fully meeting the needs of the builders of communist society is the most glorious task of our industrial workers.
    The quality of finished products depends on many basic conditions: good quality of raw materials and semi-finished products, accurate manufacturing and processing throughout the entire production process, adherence to prescribed technical production methods, and the competence and discipline of the staff. Therefore, only with the joint and collective efforts of all workers, production groups, technicians, technical staff, engineers, and leaders of the enterprise can significant improvements in product quality be achieved.
    In this regard, examples such as the Red Ridge Wool Textile United Factory, the Krupskaya Textile Factory in Ivanovo Oblast, and other advanced enterprises in the Ministry of Light Industry are worth learning from. In these places, all production groups, all production teams, and all workshops participating in the competition for the excellent quality of finished products, including engineers, technical staff, technicians, and production team leaders, are tirelessly improving production techniques, teaching new workers, promoting the experience of advanced workers, and creating all the conditions necessary for participants in the competition to successfully complete their assigned tasks. The Party organizations and trade union organizations in these enterprises organized the work of calculating and announcing the results of the competition every day. All of this has unlocked the creative suggestions of the masses, making it possible to quickly integrate valuable opinions and the work experience of Stakhanovite workers into practical work and to correct shortcomings in a timely manner.
    However, there are also enterprises that do not pay due attention to the competition for high quality products. For example, the Volodarsky Garment Factory in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, the Kirov Leather Factory, and the Karpov Factory in Leningrad are drawing righteous and severe criticism.
    The current task is to relentlessly increase the number of production groups producing first-class products everywhere, and to strive to increase the number of production teams, workshops, and enterprises that produce high-quality finished products and have high productivity! In order to successfully achieve this task, it is necessary to more widely promote the socialist competition for the excellent quality of raw materials, secondary materials, semi-finished products, and finished products, and to involve all industrial workers in this competition.
    Supporting and expanding the socialist competition for the production of high-quality products in every possible way means raising requirements and strengthening quality supervision in every enterprise, and giving Bolshevik criticism to those who manufacture inferior products. Party, government, and economic organizations should strictly abide by Comrade Stalin's instruction: "Improve the quality of the goods produced, stop the production of imperfect products, and ruthlessly punish all those who violate or violate the laws of the Soviet regime regarding the quality and integrity of products."
    The better the product, the more reliable it is to use, and the longer it lasts. Therefore, the significance of improving the quality of finished products as much as possible is equivalent to increasing the output of products without consuming more labor, raw materials, or materials. The struggle to improve the quality of products is inseparable and interconnected with the struggle for the rational and economical use of raw materials. This also explains why the patriotic initiative of the Stakhanovite workers who proposed organizing a competition for light industry workers to save cotton, wool, silk, and other raw materials—Mariya Loshnevaia, a spinner from the Kubavna Wool Textile Factory in Moscow Oblast, and Richia Kononinko, a weaver—has received such great support and the widest development. Weaver Comrade Kononinko said in a speech at a factory workers' conference:
    "Our most important task is to improve the quality of products and save raw materials."
    How accurate and profound these words are! While carefully protecting the machines, the textile workers Loshnevaia and Kononinko studied rational methods for splicing broken threads, weaving weft and warp, and other tasks, and finally completely eliminated the production of defective products, reducing the consumption of raw wool by several times. As a result, they produced extra yarn and good tweed.
    This valuable initiative of Comrades Lotunnevaia and Kononinko has been supported in many enterprises in Moscow Oblast. Not only individual Stakhanovite workers, but also entire production groups, production teams, workshops, and factories have taken on this socialist task—to save raw materials and use the saved raw materials to manufacture extra good products for the motherland. The initiative of the Stakhanovite workers of the Kubavna Factory has also been praised by the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Textile Workers' Trade Union.
    There is no doubt that the suggestions of Comrades Loshnevaia and Kononinko will be enthusiastically responded to and supported by all enterprises in our light industry and other industrial sectors, and will be as widely developed as the initiative of Alexander Chutkykh.
    The socialist competition for producing excellent products and saving raw materials, which is becoming increasingly widespread, is a powerful weapon for further improving the quality of work in all our industrial sectors, and is helping the great cause of completing the post-war Stalin Five-Year Plan in four years.

### 提高产品质量，节约原料！

　　提高产品质量，节约原料！
    现在在我们辽阔广大的国土内，恐怕已经找不出一个企业，那里没有亚历山大·丘特基赫（斯大林奖金的得奖者，“红岭羊毛纺织联合工厂”的助理技师）的追随者了。为提高成品质量的积极斗争的参加者，已经有着几十万人的数目了。
    只要说一说下面一点就够了：只是在轻工业部门中，就有两万七千左右的生产组和三十万以上的男女工人参加着为制造优良品质的生产品而斗争的竞赛。不单单在几个个别的企业中，而且一般地在苏联轻工业部的许多厅局的部门中，头等生产品的制造是大大地增加了。
    在机器制造工业、冶金工业、食品工业以及其他工业部门中，这一竞赛的参加者的数目，正在一天天地增长着。
    这一事实对国民经济方面的意义是难以估计的。那种广大群众拥护亚历山大·丘特基赫的发起的非凡的积极性和创造的热情，是劳动人民的高度社会主义觉悟，他们的真诚的苏维埃爱国主义，他们的不知疲倦地增加亲爱祖国的光荣和威力的热情努力的一种最鲜明的表示。
    在社会主义的工业已经超过了战前的生产水准而且正加速度地走向新的胜利的情况中，工作的质量上的指数开始有着越来越大的意义。每一个企业可能而且应该不但要在数量上，而且要在成品的种类上和成品的质量上完成计划。制造出世界上最优良的生产品来和更全面地来满足共产主义社会的建设者的要求，是我们工业部门工作者最光荣的一件任务。
    成品的质量是依靠着下面许多基本条件的：原料和半制品的良好质料，整个成品生产过程中的准确的制造和加工，所规定的技术生产方法的遵守，工作人员的能力和纪律性。因此，只有用企业的所有工人、生产组、技师、技术工作人员、工程师和领导人员的共同的集体的努力，才能够获得生产品质量的显著改善。
    在这一点上，象红岭羊毛纺织联合工厂、伊凡诸夫州的克鲁普斯卡亚纺织工厂以及其他轻工业部中的各先进企业这样的例子，是值得学习的。在这些地方，所有的各生产组、所有的各生产队和各车间的参加了为成品的优良品质而奋斗的这一竞赛的工程师、技术工作人员、技师和生产小组长，都不知疲倦地改进着生产的技术方法，教导着新的工人，推广着先进工人的经验，给参加竞赛的人创造所有那些能用来顺利完成所订任务的一切条件。这些企业的党的组织和职工会的组织，组织了每天计算和每天公布竞赛结果的工作。这一切就开放了群众的创造性建议，使有可能来把有价值的意见和斯塔哈诺夫工作者的工作经验迅速深入到实际工作中去，来及时纠正缺点。
    但是还有着那种对于为生产品的高等质量而斗争的竞赛并没有加以应有的注意的企业。比如说，德涅伯尔彼得洛夫州的沃洛达尔被服工厂、基洛夫皮革工厂、列宁格勒的卡尔波夫工厂等正引起着正义的严厉非难。
    到处不屈不挠地增加出产头等成品的生产组的数目，以及努力使出产优良品质的成品和有着高度生产力的生产队、车间和企业的数目也越来越多，就是目前的任务！为了顺利地实现这一任务，必须更广泛地来展开为原料、次要材料、半制品和成品的优良品质而斗争的社会主义竞赛，必须使所有工业部门的工作人员都参加到这一竞赛中去。
    用一切办法来支持与更广泛地来展开为生产优良品质的成品的社会主义竞赛，这也就是说，要提高要求，要在每一个企业中加强对于质量的监督，对制造出不良生产品的人给以布尔什维克的批评。党的、政府的和经济部门的组织、都应该严格地遵守斯大林同志的这一个指示：“要改善所生产商品的质量，要停止不完善生产品的生产，要不顾情面地去处罚所有那些破坏或者违反苏维埃政权关于生产品的质量和完整性的法律的一切人。”
    生产品越是好，使用它的时候也就越是可靠，使用的时间也就越长。因此，尽可能改善成品质量的意义，就等于不用耗费更多的劳动力、原料、材料而增加了生产品的产量一样。为提高生产品的质量而作的斗争，与为合理地、节省地使用原料而作的斗争，是不可分割而互相联系着的。这也说明着为什么提议组织轻工业部门工作人员为节约棉花、羊毛、丝和其他各种原料而斗争的竞赛的斯塔哈诺夫工作者——莫斯科州的库巴文呢料纺织工厂的纺工马里亚·洛士涅瓦亚和织工里奇亚·柯诺宁柯的爱国的发起获得了如此的最大的拥护和最广泛的开展的这一事实。织工柯诺宁柯同志在工厂工作人员大会上演讲时说：
    “我们最主要的任务，就是提高生产品的质量和节约原料。”
    这是多么准确，多么深刻的话！纺织工人洛士涅瓦亚同志和柯诺宁柯同志一方面小心在意地爱护着机器，一方面研究着断线接头，织完纬线和经线，以及其他各种工作的合理办法，终于完全消灭了次货的生产，把原料羊毛的消耗减少了好几倍，结果，他们额外地生产出了许多毛线和良好的呢料。
    洛土涅瓦亚同志和柯诺宁柯同志的这一个有价值的发起，已经在莫斯科州的许多企业中获得了拥护。不单单是个别的斯塔哈诺夫工作者，而且整个的生产组，生产队，车间和制造厂，都担负起了这一个社会主义任务——节约原料，以及用节约出来的原料给祖国制造出额外的良好的生产品来。库巴文工厂的斯塔哈诺夫工作者的发起，也获得了纺线业工人职工会中央委员会主席团的赞许。
    毫无疑义，洛士涅瓦亚同志和柯诺宁柯同志的建议将获得热烈的响应，将获得我国轻工业和其他工业部门的一切企业的拥护，将获得亚历山大·丘特基赫的发起一样的广泛的开展。
    正在越来越广泛地开展起来的为生产优良生产品和为节约原料而斗争的社会主义竞赛，是进一步提高所有我们工业部门工作的质量的一个有力武器，是帮助着四年完成战后斯大林五年计划这一伟大事业的。
