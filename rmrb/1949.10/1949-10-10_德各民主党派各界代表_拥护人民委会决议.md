Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 5th TASS dispatch: On the afternoon of October 7th, the German People's Council held its ninth session in Berlin, the capital of Germany. In addition to the representatives of the People's Council, representatives from all walks of life in Greater Berlin and the German states, Soviet representatives, and personnel from the Berlin-based missions of people's democracies attended the meeting.

When Wilhelm Pieck, Chairman of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, appeared in the presidium, everyone present welcomed him with cheers. Representatives of various political parties and democratic organizations joined him on the presidium. Pieck announced the opening of the ninth session of the German People's Council. At his suggestion, the delegates adopted the agenda for the meeting as follows: 1. Adopt the declaration of the National Front of Democratic Germany. 2. Review the political situation and adopt necessary measures. Pieck then read out the draft declaration prepared by the Presidium of the German People's Council. Subsequently, representatives such as Grotewohl (Socialist Unity Party of Germany), Professor Kasner (Liberal Democratic Party), and Nuschke (Christian Democratic Union) spoke on behalf of their respective parties, expressing full agreement with the draft declaration. Wang also spoke on behalf of the Free German Trade Union Federation, supporting the draft declaration. The delegates unanimously stood up and passed the declaration. The hall was immediately filled with a prolonged storm of cheers. The historic moment of proclaiming the founding of the German Democratic Republic was thus completed.

Regarding the second item on the agenda, the ninth session of the German People's Council, after discussing the current political situation, adopted a telegram to the Four Power Foreign Ministers, a circular telegram to the state parliaments, and a decision to form a Provisional People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic. The telegram to the Four Power Foreign Ministers stated: The demands of the democratic and peace-loving forces in Germany to restore unity, conclude a peace treaty, and withdraw occupying forces have become the common demands of millions of people in all occupation zones of Germany. As declared in numerous resolutions, the German people do not want to revoke the Potsdam Agreement. The German people therefore demand the establishment of a German democratic government, whose task will be to guarantee the peaceful and democratic restoration of Germany and to support the German people in proposing to the occupying powers the conclusion of a peace treaty and the withdrawal of occupying forces. The German People's Council itself assumes responsibility for informing the foreign ministers, currently meeting in New York, of the German people's determination and resolution. The German People's Council requests the foreign ministers to include the German question on the agenda again and to discuss measures to conclude a peace treaty with Germany as soon as possible.

The circular telegram to the state parliaments stated: The chairmen of the state parliaments should conduct: (1) convening special sessions of the state parliaments on October 10th of this year. (2) holding elections for members of the Federal Council (i.e., the second chamber of parliament). (3) enacting laws by legal majority to extend the term of the state parliaments, originally scheduled to expire this autumn, by one year, so that new elections can be held on October 15, 1950. Elections for the People's Chamber, county councils, and community representative bodies will also be held at the same time. The state parliaments should pass legislative decisions on this matter.

The decision on the formation of the Provisional People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic stated: In accordance with the Constitution of the German Democratic Republic passed by the People's Council on March 19, 1949, and approved by the Third German People's Congress on May 30, 1949, the German People's Council declares itself to be the Provisional People's Chamber of Germany.

Thus, after the meeting on October 7th, the German People's Council has ceased its functions.

　　德各民主党派各界代表
    拥护人民委会决议
    【新华社北京九日电】塔斯社柏林五日讯：十月七日下午德国人民委员会在德国的首都柏林举行第九届会议，除人民委员会的代表外，尚有大柏林市及德国各州各界的代表、苏联代表及人民民主国家驻柏林使团的人员列席会议。
    当德国统一社会党主席皮克在主席团中出现时，一切在场者均以欢呼表示欢迎。同他一同参加主席团的有各政党和民主团体的代表。皮克宣布德国人民委员会第九届会议开幕。在他的建议下，代表们通过会议的议程为：一、通过民主德国全国阵线的宣言。二、检讨政治形势并通过必要的措施。皮克接着宣读了德国人民委员会主席团主席所起草的宣言草案。之后，格罗提渥（德国统一社会党）、卡斯纳教授（自由民主党）及努舍克（基督教民主联盟）等代表各该党派发言，对宣言草案表示完全赞同。汪克也代表自由德国职工会联合会在会上发言，支持宣言草案。代表们一致起立通过了这一宣言。大厅内顿时响起了一片久久不绝的风暴般的欢呼。宣告德意志民主共和国成立的历史性的一幕至此完成。
    对于议程的第二项，德国人民委员会第九届会议在研讨目前的政治形势后，通过了致四强外长的电文，对各州议会的通电与组成德意志民主共和国临时人民议会的决定。致四强外长的电文称：德国民主及爱好和平力量争取恢复统一、缔订和约及撤退占领军队的要求，已成为全德各占区的千百万人民的共同要求。象在无数决议书中所宣称的那样，德国人民并不想取消波茨坦协定。德国人民因此要求建立德国民主政府，其任务将为保证德国的和平民主复原，并支持德国人民向占领国提出缔订和约及撤退占领军的要求。德国人民委员会本身负起责任，将德国人民的这种决心与决议通知现正在纽约集会的各国外长。德国人民委员会要求各外长将德国问题再次列入议程，并讨论各项措施，以便尽早缔订对德和约。
    致各州议会的通电称：各州议会主席应进行：（一）于本年十月十日召开各州议会特别会议。（二）举行联邦院（按即议会第二院）议员的选举。（三）以合法多数颁布法律，延长原定于今秋任期届满的州议会任期一年，以便在一九五○年十月十五日举行新的选举，人民议会及郡议会的选举及社区代表机关的选举亦将于同时举行，州议会应对此通过立法的决定。
    对组成德意志民主共和国临时人民议会的决定称：遵照人民委员会在一九四九年三月十九日通过，而在一九四九年五月三十日被第三届德国人民代表大会所批准的德意志民主共和国宪法，德国人民委员会宣告它是德国临时人民议会。
    这样，在十月七日的会议以后，德国人民委员会已停止其职能。
