　　Xi'an's 120,000 People Enthusiastically Celebrate in the Rain

　　[Report from our correspondent in Xi'an, October 2nd] The 600,000 people of Xi'an, a famous city in Northwest China, celebrated the birth of the People's Republic of China and supported the International Day of Struggle for Peace with unparalleled joy. In the early morning, people braved the continuous rain and joined the grand parade. National flags fluttered along the streets, and firecrackers crackled. The magnificent Bell Tower in the city center was adorned with huge portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and all the wall newspapers, cartoons, and colorful arches illuminated the Bell Tower with a new atmosphere. Various colorful propaganda trucks, dance and music teams, and singing groups passed by in an endless stream. At 4 p.m., 200,000 people braved the rain to hold a grand rally, which opened amidst 48 artillery salutes.習仲勳, Secretary of the Northwest Bureau of the CPC, delivered a speech in a confident tone: "We have never had such a proud day. We, the Chinese people, have endured suffering and torment, and finally stood up." He also said: "We know that the victory of the Chinese people is inseparable from the struggle of the people of the world to defend peace. We must unite with the Soviet Union, with all democratic countries, and with the people of all countries to resolutely defend peace." Mayor Jia Tuofu gave a speech saying: "We wholeheartedly support all the resolutions of the CPPCC and the People's Central Government, and unite as one, unafraid of any difficulties, to resolutely strive to realize all the resolutions of the Central Government!" His words were drowned out by thunderous slogans and cheers. Finally, the conference passed four telegrams, and a huge procession supporting peace surged into the streets at night.

　　西安十二万人冒雨热烈庆祝
    【本报记者西安二日专电】西北名城西安市六十万人民，以无比的欢欣庆贺中华人民共和国诞生，拥护国际和平斗争日。清晨人们冒着连绵大雨，卷入盛大的游行行列。沿街国旗飘扬，鞭炮齐鸣。市中心雄伟的钟楼悬挂着毛主席和朱总司令的巨像，所有的壁报、漫画和那五光十色的彩楼，把钟楼辉映得一片新生气象。各种彩色宣传卡车，各种舞蹈音乐队、歌咏队，络驿不绝。下午四时，二十万人冒雨举行盛大集会，在四十八声礼炮声中开幕。中共西北局习仲勋书记，以充满信心的语调发表演说：“我们从来未曾有过这样可以骄傲的日子，我们中国人民受尽了苦难折磨，终于站起来了。”他又说：“我们知道中国人民的胜利，是和全世界保卫和平的斗争分不开的，我们一定要和苏联联合，和一切民主国家和一切国家的人民联合，坚决保卫和平。”贾拓夫市长讲演说：“我们全心全意的拥护人民政协、人民中央政府的一切决议，并且团结一致，不怕任何艰难，为实现中央政府的一切决议而坚决奋斗！”他的话被雷动般的口号声欢呼声所淹没。最后，大会通过通电四则，入夜拥护和平的巨大行列分向各街头涌去。
