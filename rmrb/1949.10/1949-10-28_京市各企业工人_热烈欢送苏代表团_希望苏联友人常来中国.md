　　Beijing Enterprises Workers
    Warmly Welcome the Soviet Delegation
    Hoping Soviet Friends Will Visit China Often
    [Our Newspaper] Workers from various enterprises in Beijing participated in the rally to welcome the Soviet Cultural, Artistic, and Scientific Workers Delegation held yesterday (27th) with unparalleled enthusiasm. The 70th Ordnance Factory, despite its urgent production tasks, sent 500 people who walked more than ten *li* from Yonghe Temple to the Temple of Agriculture to participate in the rally. After returning, staff member Zhu Jing'an spoke about his feelings: "This time, our Soviet friends gave us a lot of help. This is the first cultural exchange. They are about to return to their country, and we hope they will write to us and keep in touch with the Chinese people." Guo Maolin said: Although the Soviet delegation's visit to China was short, it had a great effect. They were so warm and sincere, promoting the further unity of the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people. He hoped that the Soviet delegation would bring the cheers of the Chinese people's victory and the aspirations of the Chinese people back to the great socialist motherland, the Soviet Union.
    Zhang Zan@, director of the recuperation room of the 7th Telecommunications Bureau, said: "Only the Soviet art performance team can perform such wonderful programs for the Chinese people. I hope that more Soviet delegations will be sent to China in the future to help with China's construction, so that we can have more opportunities to learn from them." Worker Jing Xiu'yuan said: "This time, the Soviet delegation left a good impression on the Chinese people, making the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people even deeper."
    When the workers of the 2nd Telephone Bureau heard that they were going to welcome the Soviet comrades, everyone rushed to finish their daytime work in shifts. Worker Zhou Wenquan was so anxious that he went to the meeting without eating. The enthusiastic atmosphere at the meeting was indescribable. When watching the Soviet dance, Tang Shuqin said: From their healthy, lively, and united performance, we can see that it is a manifestation of socialist art.
    After more than 500 people from the Trolleybus Repair Factory participated in the farewell meeting, Hu Quanggui said: "Now that they are going back, in addition to seeing them off, we earnestly hope that they can come here often to guide us."

　　京市各企业工人　
    热烈欢送苏代表团　
    希望苏联友人常来中国
    【本报讯】北京市各企业工人以无比的热情参加昨（二十七）日举行的欢送苏联文化艺术科学工作者代表团的大会。七十兵工厂虽然生产任务很急，还有五百人步行十多里路，从雍和宫到先农坛参加了大会。回来之后，职员朱静安谈到他的感想：“这次苏联朋友给我们许多帮助，这是初次的文化交流。他们要回国去了，我们盼望给我们来信，与中国人民联系。”郭茂林说：苏联代表团来到中国，虽然时间很短，但收到的效果很大。他们是那么亲热诚恳，促使中苏两国人民的友谊更进一步的团结，希望苏联代表团把中国人民胜利的欢呼，把中国人民的愿望都带回伟大的社会主义祖国苏联。
    电信七局修养室主任张赞＠说：“只有苏联艺术演出队才能给中国人民表演这样精彩的节目，希望以后苏联代表团更多的派来中国，帮助中国的建设，以便利我们有更多的机会向他们学习。”工人景绣瑗说：“这次苏联代表团给中国人民留下良好的印象，使中苏两国人民的友情更深了。”
    电话二局工人听到了要欢送苏联同志，大家争先恐后把白天的工作倒班完毕，工人周文泉急得未吃饭就去开会了。会场上热烈的情绪没法子说出来，看苏联跳舞的时候，唐树琴说：从他们的健康、活泼、团结的表演中，就看出是社会主义艺术的表现。
    电车修造厂五百多人参加欢送会后，胡泉桂说：“现在他们要回去了，我们除了欢送以外，热切的盼望他们能经常的到我们这里来，指导我们。”
