　　Two Million People in the Capital Cheer and Celebrate the Founding of the People's Republic of China and Support Mao Zedong's Election as Chairman of the Government
　　[Our Newspaper News] The founding of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, the first and only truly representative government of the 475 million people in Chinese history, has brought indescribable joy and jubilation to the people of the whole country. The joy and jubilation of the two million people in Beijing, the location of the Central People's Government, is even more difficult to describe. After the newspaper published the design of the national flag of the People's Republic of China approved by the CPPCC, many institutions, organizations, schools, businesses, and even private residences immediately and automatically ordered new national flags. Yongmao Industrial Company alone made more than 4,000 flags in three days. The Xin Jian Garment Factory, which undertook the task of making the national flags, worked day and night, but still could not meet the demands of customers. Customers lined up in front of the door anxiously to buy, determined to hang them up during the grand ceremony of the founding of the Central People's Government on October 1st, or even earlier.

　　首都二百万人民欢欣鼓舞
    庆祝中华人民共和国成立拥护毛泽东当选政府主席
    【本报讯】中国历史上第一个也是唯一的真正代表四亿七千五百万人民的中华人民共和国中央人民政府的成立，给全国人民带来了说不尽的愉快与欢欣。中央人民政府所在地的北京市二百万人民，其欢欣与愉快是更难形容的。报纸上公布了政协通过的中华人民共和国国旗的图样之后，许多机关、团体、学校、商号以至民宅，立即自动去订做新式国旗。光永茂实业公司一家，三天就做了四千多幅。包揽做国旗的新建被服厂各单位，连明连夜的赶，也还是不能满足顾客的要求。顾客们成排地挤在门前急着买，一定要想在十月一日中央人民政府成立盛典时挂出来，或挂得更早一些。
