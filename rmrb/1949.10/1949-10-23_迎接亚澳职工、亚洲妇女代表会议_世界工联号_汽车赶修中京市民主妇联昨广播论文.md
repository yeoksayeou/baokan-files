　　Welcoming the Asian-Australian Workers' Conference and the Asian Women's Representatives Conference
  　"World Federation of Trade Unions" Bus Being Repaired, Beijing Municipal Democratic Women's Federation Broadcasts Essay Yesterday
    [Beijing News] Workers at the Capital Bus Repair Factory are repairing two scrapped buses to welcome the Asian-Australian Workers' Conference. When the news that the Asian-Australian Workers' Conference was planned to be held in the capital reached the Public Bus Company Repair Factory, all the workers in the factory cheered. Engine Department worker Wang Wei issued a call to his production team members Zhang Yingjun, Xu Bingxian, and others to use their spare time (including Sundays and holidays) to repair a broken bus that had been neglected for many years, naming it "World Federation of Trade Unions," as a gift to welcome the Asian-Australian Workers' Conference. Workers Wu Zhiheng, Zhao Fuyu, Huang Fengqi, and others from another production team responded to the call and also repaired a "Federation of Trade Unions" bus, challenging Wang Wei's team, determined not to fall behind. Several team leaders from the Sheet Metal Department, Electrical Department, and Carpentry Department also joined in. From the end of September to the present, the two "Federation of Trade Unions" buses have been mostly repaired, waiting only for painting. They are scheduled to be driven out on the anniversary of the October Revolution. Everyone's spirits are extremely high. Veteran worker Zhang Yingjun said excitedly: "We will repair the 'Federation of Trade Unions' bus beautifully. When the time comes, we will drive it to welcome the workers' representatives from various countries, let them sit in the bus we dedicated and run on the roads of our capital!" (Jia Zhaoji)
    [Beijing News] The Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Municipal Democratic Women's Federation broadcast an essay yesterday (22nd) at 5:15 p.m. on the second station of the Xinhua Broadcasting Station, entitled "Welcoming the Asian Women's Representatives Conference," calling on all women in Beijing to pay attention to this conference and to welcome it with the highest enthusiasm and practical actions. The article first described the reasons and process for the International Federation of Women deciding to convene the Asian Women's Representatives Conference. After analyzing the different positions of women in the three different societies of Asia: socialist, new democratic, and colonial and semi-colonial, it pointed out: "Women representatives from three different societies gather together to exchange experiences of struggle and construction, to encourage and help the oppressed and unliberated people, so as to make Asian women more closely united and push forward the Asian national liberation struggle. This is the most important significance of the Asian Women's Representatives Conference. At the same time, the Asian Women's Representatives Conference has its world significance. The convening of the Asian Women's Representatives Conference will surely make the world peace camp more consolidated and expanded, because world peace is indivisible." The essay also pointed out: "The holding of the conference in Beijing is the greatest glory for Chinese women, especially Beijing women. This is because the great victory of the Chinese people's revolution has created the conditions for the conference to be held in China." Finally, the Municipal Women's Federation issued a call to all women's organizations in Beijing and various organizations including women members: First, to fully support and assist the Democratic Women's Federation in completing the preparatory work and in-depth publicity for the conference, and to carry out internationalist education. Second, strengthen the work in their respective positions and use practical actions to welcome the conference. Third, make some specific preparations, such as collecting exhibits and publicity materials, preparing to hold various mass welcome rallies, and inviting representatives from various countries to visit, etc.

　　迎接亚澳职工、亚洲妇女代表会议
  　“世界工联号”汽车赶修中京市民主妇联昨广播论文
    【北京讯】首都公共汽车修理厂职工修理废车二辆，迎接亚澳职工代表会议。当亚澳职工代表会议拟定于首都举行的消息传到公共汽车公司修理厂后，全厂职工全都欢腾起来，引擎部工友王维一号召他的生产小组张英俊、许炳贤等工友利用工余时间（星期日和休假在内）把多年来未被人理睬过的破汽车修好一部，定名叫“世界工联号”，作为迎接亚澳职工代表会议的献礼。另一生产小组的工友吴志恒、赵福玉、黄凤岐等响应号召，也修一部“工联号”，并向王维一组挑战，决不落后。板金部、电工部、木工部的几位组长也都纷纷参加。从九月底至现在，两部“工联号”车大部已修成，只待喷漆，预定十月革命节开出，大家情绪极高。老工人张英俊兴奋地说：“我们把‘工联号’修理得漂漂亮亮的，到时候咱们开着它去迎接各国职工代表，让他们坐着咱们献的车子在咱们国都的马路上跑跑。”（贾肇基）
    【北京讯】北京市民主妇联筹委会昨（二十二）日下午五时一刻在新华广播电台第二台广播一篇题为“迎接亚洲妇女代表会议”的论文，号召全北京的妇女重视这个会议，并以最高的热情和实际行动来迎接这个会议。该文首先叙述国际妇联决定召开亚洲妇代会的原因和经过。在分析亚洲社会主义、新民主主义及殖民地半殖民地三种不同社会的妇女所处的不同地位之后，指出：“来自三种不同社会的妇女代表，聚首一堂，互相交换斗争和建设的经验，鼓舞和帮助被压迫而尚未解放的人民，从而使亚洲妇女更紧密的团结起来，把亚洲民族解放斗争推进一步，这就是亚洲妇女代表会议最重要的意义。同时亚洲妇代会有它的世界意义，亚洲妇代会的召开，必将使世界和平阵营更加巩固与扩大，因为世界和平是不可分的。”论文又指出：“会议在北京召开是中国妇女尤其是北京妇女最大的光荣，这是由于中国人民革命的伟大胜利造成了会议能够在中国召开的条件。”最后，市妇联向全北京市的妇女团体和包括妇女会员的各团体发出号召：第一，要全力支持并协助民主妇联完成大会的筹备工作与深入的宣传，并展开国际主义教育。第二，加强本岗位的工作，用实际行动来迎接大会。第三，作一些具体的准备工作，例如搜集展览品和宣传材料，准备举行各种群众性的欢迎会，招待各国代表参观等。
