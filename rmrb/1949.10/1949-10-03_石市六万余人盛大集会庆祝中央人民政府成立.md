　　[Our Correspondent in Shijiazhuang, 2nd Dispatch] Today, over 60,000 people in Shijiazhuang City held a grand rally to celebrate the establishment of the Central People's Government and the International Day of Struggle for Peace. For the past two days, the entire city has been decorated with lanterns and colored streamers. People have celebrated with even more joy than during a festival, tidying up their appearances and putting on new clothes. The Yangko teams from all factories, government offices, and schools were dispatched today to perform in the streets and conduct propaganda in the suburbs. A large number of peasants from the suburbs also came to the city. The rally was held in front of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions on Zhonghua Road. Red flags fluttered, forming a red sea, crowding the thirty-meter-wide road. Workers held high the award flags won in the two great production emulation campaigns. Many units held portraits of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, Chairman Mao, and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. Li Yongshun, a sixty-four-year-old veteran worker from the "February 7th" strike, wore a red sash diagonally across his chest, dressed like an old bridegroom, and led the Yangko dance. More than ten people spoke at the meeting, including Mao Duo, Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, Zang Boping, Deputy Mayor, Zeng Yongquan, Deputy Principal of the Military and Political University, representatives of workers, peasants, and business circles, and Ji Dazhuang, a People's Liberation Army soldier who performed three great meritorious deeds and is now studying at North China University. They unanimously expressed their support for the Central People's Government and the resolutions of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and pledged to launch a large-scale production and construction movement. They also resolutely expressed their support for the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union and opposition to the imperialists' conspiracy to create new wars. A grand torch parade was held after the meeting.
