Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 21st: After the list of candidates for various institutions of the Central People's Government was announced, a Guangming Daily reporter from the China Democratic League interviewed Li Jishen, Vice Chairman of the Central People's Government and Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang; Zhang Lan, Vice Chairman of the Central People's Government and Chairman of the China Democratic League; Guo Moruo, Vice Premier of the Government Administration Council and non-party democratic personage; and the spokesperson of the China Democratic National Construction Association, asking them to comment on the establishment of the various institutions of the Central People's Government.

Li Jishen said: The list of the various institutions of the Central People's Government fully demonstrates the gathering of experienced, knowledgeable, and progressive talents from all over the country; it fully demonstrates the spirit of great unity of the people. With this scale of institutions and such talent, it will certainly be able to shoulder the important tasks of the Common Program, and it will certainly be able to handle affairs well for the people. This concentration of talent isolates and suppresses the remnants of imperialism and other reactionaries, thereby reducing many obstacles to national construction and laying the permanent foundation of the People's Republic of China.

Zhang Lan said: This time, with the establishment of the Central People's Government, the division of labor and personnel allocation in all institutions and departments are very appropriate. The division of labor in institutions and departments is meticulous, because the People's Government serves the people, and the work of national construction must be realistic and truly make things happen. The more meticulous the division of labor, the more concentrated the energy, and then things can be done. Secondly, the personnel configuration of each institution and department is very broad, because at the beginning of the founding of the country, coupled with China's large population and vast territory, all construction needs to advance simultaneously, so it is natural to gather talents from all parties to make the best use of their talents.

Guo Moruo said: This is a genuine, unadulterated, people's democratic united government. All aspects have been taken care of very thoughtfully, and the candidates have been carefully coordinated. In the future, in the application of state power and the implementation of the "Common Program," good results will definitely be achieved, and the people's trust will not be disappointed.

The spokesperson of the China Democratic National Construction Association said: This is a further great development of the great unity of the Chinese people; the spirit of "the world is for all" of the Chinese Communist Party can no longer be doubted by anyone. This lineup will shock the imperialists and further shake the remnants of the bandits. Their speculations, fantasies, and rumors have now been shattered by iron-like facts! In the past, we did not work hard enough for the revolution, and we also lacked experience in practical political work. In the future, we must work even harder, learn diligently in our work, and serve the people wholeheartedly. We hope that the national business community can better understand the future political trends, and more actively take on the identity of the masters of the new country, and work together to develop production and prosper the economy. Every effort will get a point of effect.

　　中央人民政府各机构建立
  　民主党派热烈拥护
    认为各部门分工用人都很适当定能负起实现共同纲领的重任
    【新华社北京二十一日电】中央人民政府各机构人选名单公布后，此间民主同盟的光明日报记者分别访问了中央人民政府副主席、中国国民党革命委员会主席李济深，中央人民政府副主席、中国民主同盟主席张澜，政务院副总理、无党派民主人士郭沫若，民主建国会发言人等，请他们对中央人民政府各机构的建立发表谈话。李济深称：中央人民政府各机构的名单充分地显示出网罗了全国有奋斗经验的、有专门学识的和进步的人才；充分显示出人民大团结的精神。有了这个规模的机构和这样的人才，一定能担负起共同纲领的重大任务，也一定能为人民把事情办好。这次人才的集中就孤立了和镇压了帝国主义等反动派的残余，因而减少了建国的许多阻力，奠定了中华人民共和国的永久的基础。张澜说：这次中央人民政府建立，所有机构部门的分工及用人都很适当。机构部门分工精细，因为人民政府是给人民服务的，建国工作要能实事求是，切切实实的真做出事来，则分工越精细，精力越集中，然后才能做得出事来。其次各机构部门负责人员配置很广泛，这是因为在开国之初，加以中国人口之众和幅员之广，各项建设均急待齐头并进，自然要网罗各方人才，使人尽其用。郭沫若说：这是一个货真价实、不折不扣的人民民主的联合政府。各方面都照顾得很周到，人选也配合得煞费苦心，将来在政权的运用上，在“共同纲领”的实施上，一定能够收到很好的效果，不负人民的重托的。民主建国会发言人称：这是中国人民大团结的进一步的伟大发展；中共“天下为公”的精神，从此是再也没有人能够怀疑的了。这一个阵容将会使帝国主义大吃一惊，使匪帮残余进一步动摇。他们这样那样的揣测，这样那样的幻想，这样那样的谣言，现在都给铁一般的事实粉碎了！我们过去对革命努力不够，对实际政治工作也缺少经验，今后更要加倍努力，勤勤恳恳的在工作中学习，切切实实为人民服务。我们希望全国工商界更能了然于今后的政治趋势，更积极的拿出新国家主人翁的身份，一致为发展生产，繁荣经济而努力。每一分努力都会得到一分的效果。
