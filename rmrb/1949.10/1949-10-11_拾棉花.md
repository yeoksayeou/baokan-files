　　Picking Cotton
    Zhong Ling
    Green stalks,
    Snowy cotton flowers,
    A newlywed bride picks cotton.
　
    The flower bolls hang in clusters,
    Plump hands
    Pick a flower, pluck it off,
    Turning back to look at him:
    "Look!
    How big these flowers are!"
　
    He is young, tall,
    This cotton field was grown by him:
    "The flowers are big,
    It's from our labor;
    We missed you in the spring,
    Mutual aid relied on everyone!"
　
    The bride smiles slightly,
    The young man quickly picks two more handfuls,
    He asks her:
    "Can you do farm work?"
    She says:
    "I was born and raised here,
    Crawling in the fields since I was little..."
    She looks up,
    Her sparkling black eyes,
    Make the young man shy.
　
    Her plump face glows red,
    After speaking, they both lower their heads to think -
    The land reform distributed land and houses,
    With food to eat and clothes to wear,
    Organizing together for production,
    We peasants must repay our new country!
　
    Picking one flower after another,
    You a handful, me a handful,
    The young couple,
    Bundle after bundle,
    Picking until the sun sets.

　　拾棉花
    钟铃
    青青的棵子，
    雪绒绒的花，
    新娶的媳妇拾棉花。
　
    花桃结的一挂挂，
    胖胖的手儿
    摘一朵，揪一下，
    回过头来看看他：
    “你瞧！
    这花开的有多大？”
　
    他年青，个子大，
    这块棉花地由他养种大：
    “花儿开的大，
    是咱劳动下；
    春天家里少个你，
    互助点种靠大家！”
　
    媳妇听了微微笑，
    小伙子紧紧又拾两把，
    他问她：
    “你可会务庄稼？”
    她说：
    “咱土生土长这么大，
    从小就在地里爬……”
    她昂起头来看一下，
    滴溜溜的黑眼珠，
    看的小伙子羞答答。
　
    胖胖的脸儿红光光，
    说罢两人低头想——
    土改分了地和房，
    有了吃也有了穿，
    组织起来闹生产，
    庄户人要报答咱新国家！
　
    摘了一朵又一朵，
    你一把来我一把，
    小俩口，
    一包一包，
    摘到太阳下。
