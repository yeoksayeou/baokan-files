    Lists it as One of the Central Tasks, Dispatches Work Teams to Guide Work in the Countryside

The work of seed selection has aroused widespread attention in various regions. There has been universal promotion of the importance of "big mother, fat son" seed selection. Especially in Chahar North, wheat black blight has historically reached 30 to 40 percent, with severe cases reaching 70 percent, causing huge losses. Therefore, Chahar Province emphasizes listing seed selection as one of the central tasks and has dispatched work teams to help carry it out in the countryside. It is reported that over ten thousand shi of seeds have already been selected in Chahar North. The methods of seed selection are roughly three types: plot selection, ear selection, and field selection.
