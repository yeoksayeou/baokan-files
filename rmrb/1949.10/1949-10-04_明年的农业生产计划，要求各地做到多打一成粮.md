    Next Year's Agricultural Production Plan Requires All Regions to Increase Grain Production by 10%
　　  The decision puts forward next year's agricultural production plan, requiring all regions to increase grain production by 10%. The province's cotton planting area should reach 5 million to 7 million mu, and peanut planting 6 million to 8 million mu. Strengthen the technical guidance of agricultural production, help farmers improve farming methods, and experiment with and improve agricultural tools and tractors. Actively prevent pests and diseases, and use the winter slack season to build water conservancy projects.
    In order to coordinate with agricultural production, the decision pointed out that military industrial production should transfer part of its productivity to the manufacture of agricultural tools; state-owned industrial and commercial enterprises should resolutely implement the policy of relying on rural areas and serving rural areas, vigorously help agricultural production, and persuade and help private industrial and commercial enterprises to change their past operating methods and turn to operations that are beneficial to rural production. Secondly, it is necessary to strengthen the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, establish leading organs of cooperatives from top to bottom, develop supply and marketing cooperatives with emphasis, and at the same time transform old cooperatives. Government industrial and commercial trade authorities should regard cooperatives as a powerful assistant to the state-owned economy and vigorously support them.
    The decision pointed out that under the central task of production and disaster relief, it is necessary to focus on solving the land problems that must and can be solved in the recovery and development of production, according to the specific conditions of each region. In old and semi-old areas, the land in 74% of the villages has been equally divided, and the land reform work has been basically completed. Generally, land ownership should no longer be changed. The problems left over from the land reform (such as determining land ownership, correcting wrongly classified components, compensating losses to middle peasants, etc.) must be combined with production and disaster relief, and properly handled under conditions conducive to the recovery and development of production. In newly recovered areas, the central task of production and disaster relief should be resolutely implemented, and combined with the handling of land ownership, crops, and the mobilization and organization of the masses. When dealing with land ownership, the government and representatives of peasant associations should jointly and appropriately deal with the land transferred from landlords and rich peasants to peasants in accordance with government decrees. In the new areas, the current focus is on suppressing bandits and counter-espionage, stabilizing social order, carrying out production and disaster relief, implementing reasonable burdens, mobilizing the masses, and preparing conditions for the future implementation of land reform. The instruction pointed out that in dealing with land issues, no matter what kind of area, it is necessary to resolutely not touch the land of middle peasants (including well-to-do middle peasants). As for individual middle peasants who have hegemonic behavior, it should also be regarded as an internal problem of the peasants and resolved by the peasant association.
    The decision also stipulates that all regions should resolutely implement the repeated instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the East China Bureau, and the Shandong Branch Bureau on quickly convening people's representative conferences at all levels. In the old and semi-old areas where land reform has been implemented, people's representative conferences at the county, district, and township levels should be resolutely convened. At the beginning, people's representative conferences from all walks of life can be convened first to accumulate experience and prepare for the transition to the formal convening of fully elected people's representative conferences. In the counties of the newly liberated areas, people's representative conferences from all walks of life should be generally convened, and peasant representative conferences should be convened in districts and townships, absorbing revolutionary intellectuals to participate. The responsible comrades of the Party and government at all levels must personally lead, create experience, and ensure that the whole Party can learn to unite the broad masses through these conferences, overcome difficulties, and restore and develop production. The instruction finally requires that the Party branches and Party members in the rural areas must establish the idea of long-term leadership of production, must participate in and lead labor mutual aid organizations and cooperatives, and give play to the core role of the branches and Party members.

    明年的农业生产计划，要求各地做到多打一成粮
　　  决定提出了明年的农业生产计划，要求各地做到多打一成粮，全省植棉面积要达到五百万到七百万亩，花生种植六百万亩到八百万亩，加强农业生产的技术领导，帮助农民改良耕作方法，试用和改良农具及拖拉机。积极防止病虫害，利用冬闲期间兴修水利。
    为配合农业生产，决定指出，军事工业生产应将一部分生产力转入制造农具；公营工商业应坚决执行依靠农村为农村服务的方针，大力帮助农业生产，说服与帮助私营工商业改变过去的经营方法，转向有利于农村生产的经营。其次，要加强城乡物资交流，由上而下建立合作社的领导机关，有重点地发展供销合作社，同时改造旧有合作社。政府工商贸易机关应把合作社看做国营经济的有力助手，大力予以扶持。
    决定指出，在生产救灾的中心任务下，要根据各地具体情况，有重点地去解决那些在恢复与发展生产中必须解决与可能解决的土地问题。在老区半老区，百分之七十四的村庄的土地已经平分，土地改革工作已基本上完成，一般地权应不再变更。对土地改革中所遗留下的问题（如确定地权、改订错订成份、补偿中农损失等）必须结合生产救灾，并在有利于恢复和发展生产的条件下，予以适当处理。在新收复区，应坚决贯彻生产救灾的中心任务，并结合进行处理地权、农作物，发动组织群众等项工作。处理地权时，应根据政府的法令，由政府与农会代表共同适当地处理地主富农向农民所倒算的土地。在新区，目前主要是剿匪反特务，安定社会秩序，进行生产救灾，实行合理负担，发动群众，准备将来实行土地改革的条件。指示指出，在处理土地问题时，不论何种地区，均必须坚决不动中农土地（包括富裕中农在内），至于个别中农有霸占行为者，亦应看作农民内部问题，由农会解决。
    决定并规定，各地应坚决执行中共中央、华东局、山东分局关于迅速召开各界人民代表会议的迭次指示。在已实行土地改革的老区、半老区，应坚决召开县、区、乡三级人民代表大会。在开始时可先召开各界人民代表会议，以积累经验，准备过渡到正式召开普选的全权的人民代表大会。在新解放区的县，应普遍召开各界人民代表会议，区、乡召开农民代表会议，吸收革命知识分子参加。各地党政负责同志必须亲自领导，创造经验，务使全党都能学会通过这些会议，团结广大群众，克服困难，恢复与发展生产。指示最后要求在农村中党的支部、党员必须确立长期领导生产的思想，必须参加和领导劳动互助组织和合作社，发挥支部、党员的核心作用。
