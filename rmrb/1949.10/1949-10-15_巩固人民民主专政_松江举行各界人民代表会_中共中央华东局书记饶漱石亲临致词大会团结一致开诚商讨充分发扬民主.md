Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 14th:

　　To consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, Songjiang County held a people's representatives conference from all walks of life.  Rao Shushi, Secretary of the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, attended and delivered a speech.  The conference was united, open-minded, and engaged in thorough discussion, fully promoting democracy.

　　【Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 14th】 Songjiang County's unprecedented event in its history – the County People's Representatives Conference from All Circles, was held on September 30 in the county seat of Songjiang. The meeting was attended by 286 representatives from various districts, towns, various industries and circles in Songjiang County (including 25 women). These included 35 worker representatives, 138 peasant representatives, 13 youth and student representatives, 22 education representatives, 15 other self-employed representatives, 3 women representatives, 30 business representatives, 11 enlightened gentry representatives, and 19 party, government, and military representatives.

　　On the opening day of the conference, after County Magistrate Lu Xunru reported on the preparations and the presidium was approved, Rao Shushi, Secretary of the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, who had rushed from Shanghai to attend the conference, stood up and delivered a speech amidst warm applause (the full text of the speech will be published separately). In the afternoon, Yu Ke, Secretary of the Songjiang County Committee of the CPC, reported to the conference on the future work guidelines and tasks of Songjiang County, and County Magistrate Lu reported on the administrative work in the four months since liberation.

　　　　Group Discussions
　　On the second and third days, group discussions were held, divided into ten groups: one group for workers, one group for peasants in each district (a total of six groups), one group for youth, one group for the self-employed, and one group for industry and commerce and gentry, studying and discussing the three reports, the Provisional Regulations on Rent Reduction and Interest Reduction in Rural Areas of the East China New Area (draft), the Draft Amendment to the Measures for Collecting Public Grain and Public Grass by the Administrative Office of the Southern Jiangsu Administrative Region, and the Shanghai Military Control Commission's Interim Procedures for Mediation of Labor-Capital Disputes in Private Enterprises and the Interim Measures for Handling Disputes over Resumption of Business and Work. The presidium also went to each group to explain the spirit of fully promoting democracy at the conference, encouraging representatives to speak enthusiastically. At the same time, individual conversations and off-site discussions were conducted to ensure that opinions from all parties were expressed without reservation, truly achieving knowing everything and saying everything.

　　During the group discussions, the three reports and several regulations were unanimously endorsed. However, many questions and specific opinions were raised regarding the implementation of rent reduction and interest reduction and the autumn grain burden. For example, how to specifically implement rent reduction in Songjiang, how to distinguish between high and low interest rates, how to distinguish between rich and middle peasants, and how to cumulatively progress with simple progressive rates, which industries and businesses have prospects and which do not, etc. For example, some peasant representatives believed that if the starting point for collection is not determined when the grass-roots government is not yet transformed, the poor peasants would suffer when reducing or exempting autumn grain. Some believed that the progressive rate of twenty catties for every twenty yuan of assessment was too heavy, and the middle peasants would be unable to afford it. Some believed that in the past, tenants did not bear agricultural taxes, but now they have to bear a part. Some gentry representatives believed that "stopping interest" was acceptable, but they were afraid that the capital would not be recovered. Some believed that the burden on large landlords was lighter, while the progressive rate on small and medium landlords was heavier. Both peasant representatives and gentry representatives unanimously advocated that the basic burden of public grain in the autumn of this year should be paid on behalf of the tenants.

　　　　General Discussion
　　On the fourth day and the morning of the fifth day, general discussions were held, and representatives from all walks of life scrambled to sign up and speak enthusiastically. In the speeches of 42 representatives from various circles before and after, everyone unanimously praised the past achievements of the People's Government, supported the future administrative policy, and believed in the necessity of strengthening the democratic unity of the people from all walks of life. For example, business representatives Chen Jialian and Wang Longfan said: The production of representatives from all strata of people, including election and engagement, truly breathed the air of democracy at the meeting. We must implement Chairman Mao's line and distinguish between loyalty and treachery. It was right not to cooperate with the reactionaries before liberation and to be passive; today, we must actively serve the people, not sit on the fence, not speculate, and have a clear stand. Gentry representative Wu Boyang said: "We must be diligent. Only diligence can lead to life. Now that imperialism is declining and socialism is flourishing, everyone should take the bright road." Another gentry representative, Zhu Shujian, refuted some opinions that overly catered to the interests of the landlords themselves in his speech. He said, "In the past, you cruelly exploited the peasants, impoverishing them and shrinking production; now, on the issue of burden, you do not consider the needs of the people's liberation war, but haggle over every ounce!" Cultural and educational representatives Shen Tianmo and Shen Yuruo both said: Only when the lives of peasants are improved can education develop. Teachers should use their spare time to promote compulsory education for peasants and workers. Middle school students and children should serve the peasants under the leadership of the school and the New Democratic Youth League. Self-employed representative Zhang Zhipai said: "Workers and peasants are the creators of all wealth in society, and they are the most knowledgeable, while we who wear long robes and suits are often less knowledgeable. Everyone must learn from the workers and peasants." Women's representative Jiang Zhaolin said: "Women in Songjiang should organize under the leadership of the Communist Party and actively participate in production; educated women should go to the countryside to serve and participate in the peasant emancipation movement." Youth representatives Zhang Liutao and Xu Ruiying said: "The big landlords feel that their lives are hard because their rent rice is reduced, but their lives are not really hard. Rent reduction must be thoroughly implemented so that the children and youth of peasant families can study." Christian Zhao Zongzhu said: "I have personally seen the People's Government respect freedom of religious belief and protect the church, and I am deeply grateful. In the future, I should abide by the laws and decrees of the People's Government." In their speeches, worker and peasant representatives fully demonstrated their great minds and the spirit of being masters of the country. For example, worker representatives Tang Chenggui, Liu Chengsheng, etc. said: "This conference proves that the broad masses of the people have been politically liberated. In the future, everyone must unite to fight for the realization of tasks such as eliminating bandits, eliminating special agents, reasonable burden, production for disaster relief, rent reduction and interest reduction, transforming grassroots power, and strengthening mutual assistance between urban and rural areas." "To turn Songjiang, a consumer city, into a productive city, our working class must endure temporary difficulties and work hard to produce. Capitalists should also actively operate their businesses and jointly overcome the difficulties imposed on us by the imperialists and reactionaries' blockade and sabotage." After a gentry representative expressed the opinion that "the fundamental reason for the bankruptcy and poverty of peasants is that they do not engage in proper work and are lazy and gluttonous," peasant representative Shen Yiqing stood up and replied: "I am a barefoot peasant, representing the peasant class to say a few words. Under the rule of the reactionary government, in addition to heavy rent and high interest, there were also military rice, conscript rice, autonomy fees, gun donations, etc., which exploited us to the point where we could not breathe. We have no money to fertilize, and the harvest has been declining year by year. Prices are soaring, and peasants are losing out everywhere. Please think about it, representatives: How exactly did we become poor?" The representatives in the audience shouted: "Exploited by the reactionaries and landlords!" Shen Yiqing asked: "Who exactly is lazy and gluttonous?" The representatives in the audience shouted: "Big landlords are lazy and gluttonous!" Shen Yiqing continued: "Yes! It is they who really impoverish us, who are really lazy and gluttonous. They live a life of wealth and prosperity, while we toil all year round and cannot get enough to eat. We will no longer care about these things, but this year we must eliminate bandits and special agents, overthrow bullies, and thoroughly reduce rent. We hope that worker brothers, revolutionary intellectuals, and democratic people from all walks of life will assist us."

　　　　Resolutions
　　The meeting continued on the afternoon of October 4th. In addition to unanimously expressing support for the report of Yu Ke, Secretary of the Songjiang County Committee of the CPC, on the future work guidelines and tasks, and the report of County Magistrate Lu on the administrative work of the Songjiang County People's Government in the past four months, the following resolutions were also passed. These included: (1) Supporting the "Southern Jiangsu Administrative Region Administrative Office's 1949 Revised Measures for the Collection of Public Grain and Public Grass," and passing the "Amendment to the Supplementary Measures for the Implementation of the Collection of Public Grain and Public Grass in Songjiang County in 1949." In this case, the conference, based on the opinions of all parties, stipulated the starting point for the assessment: those with less than two yuan would be exempt from the autumn public grain and public grass, and the progressive burden on middle peasants and small and medium-sized landlords would be reduced. (2) The "Draft Provisional Regulations on Rent Reduction in Rural Areas of the East China New Area" was unanimously endorsed, and based on the proposal of all peasant representatives, the "Supplementary Provisions for the Specific Implementation of Rent Reduction and Interest Reduction in Songjiang County" was adopted. In these supplementary provisions, the conference adopted useful opinions from all parties. (3) Supporting the "Provisional Procedures for the Mediation of Labor-Capital Disputes in Private Enterprises" and the "Provisional Measures for the Handling of Disputes over the Resumption of Work and Business" promulgated by the Shanghai Military Control Commission, and suggesting that the government formulate supplementary implementation measures based on the situation in Songjiang and submit them to the next conference for discussion. (4) After the closing of the conference, the presidium would serve as a resident committee until the opening of the second meeting. It was also agreed to establish research committees on issues such as production and disaster relief, culture and education, resumption of work and business and labor-capital relations, and tax consolidation to carry out work under the leadership of the resident committee.

　　During the conference, 165 proposals were received from various representatives, including 32 on culture and education, 30 on production and disaster relief, 20 on labor-capital relations, 18 on medicine and health, 16 on finance and taxation, 14 on industry and commerce, 7 on public security, and 14 others. The last 14 received were not yet classified. After the conference unanimously passed various resolutions, County Magistrate Lu spoke. He expressed his gratitude to all representatives for their trust in the government and sincerely accepted the various resolutions of the conference. Finally, Yu Ke delivered a closing speech on behalf of the presidium. He pointed out that the conference was successful due to the unity of all representatives and open-minded discussions. He hoped that the representatives would go back and widely convey the spirit and resolutions of the conference to the masses of all circles, and turn the resolutions of the conference into the actions of the masses throughout the county. At this point, the unprecedentedly united grand meeting of people from all walks of life in Songjiang, which had undergone five days of heated discussions, was declared a victorious conclusion.

　　　　Reflections after the Conference
　　After the conference, worker and peasant representatives believed: "This conference has five good things: first, it is good that the status of workers and peasants has been improved; second, it is good that people from all walks of life are united; third, it is good to hear the reports of party, government, and military leaders; fourth, it is good that the principles and methods of emancipation have been determined; fifth, it is good that the living conditions during the conference are well taken care of." Gentry representatives said: "Before the meeting, we thought that this meeting would not be the same as the Kuomintang's Senate, where the government first made the framework and then put it on our heads during the meeting; we never expected such democracy." Cultural and educational representatives said: "This conference fully demonstrated the correctness of the leadership of the Communist Party and the greatness of the working class, which is equivalent to giving us a great class."

    在会议开幕的一天，在陆恂如县长报告筹备经过及通过主席团后，由上海赶来参加大会的中共中央华东局书记饶漱石，在热烈掌声中起立致词（讲词全文另发）。下午中共松江县县委会书记余克向大会报告松江县今后工作方针与任务，陆县长报告解放以来四个月施政工作。
    　　　　分组讨论
    第二、第三两日进行分组讨论，共分成十个组，计：职工一组，农民每区各一组（共六组），青年一组，自由职业者一组，工商业及士绅一组，研究与讨论三个报告及华东新区农村减租减息暂行条例（草案），苏南行政区行政公署关于征收公粮公草修正办法草案，上海市军管会关于私营企业劳资争议调处程序及关于复业复工纠纷处理二个暂行办法等。主席团并分头到各组说明大会充分发扬民主的精神，启发代表踊跃发言。同时进行个别交谈及会外座谈，使各方意见无保留地发表出来，真正做到知无不言，言无不尽。
    在各组讨论中对三个报告和几个条例一致拥护。但对减租减息及秋征负担的实施办法提出许多问题和具体意见。如减租在松江如何具体实施，高利与低利如何分界，富农与中农如何区分，简易累进如何累进，工商业那些有前途和那些无前途等。又如农民代表有的认为在目前基层政权未改造时，秋征办法如不确定起征点，则在减免时，贫苦农民要吃亏。有的认为赋额从二十元起累进二十斤是太重了，中农将无力负担。有的认为过去佃户不负担农业税，现在要负担一部分。士绅代表有的认为“停息”可以，但恐本钱收不回来。有的认为大地主负担较轻，中小地主累进较重。又农民代表和士绅代表都一致主张今年秋季公粮的基本负担部分，应采取佃户代缴的方法等。
    　　　　大会讨论
    第四天及第五天上午进行大会讨论，各界代表都争先报名，热烈发言。在前后各界四十二位代表发言中，大家一致赞扬人民政府过去政绩，拥护今后施政方针，并认为加强各界人民民主团结的必要。如工商业代表陈家连、王隆藩等说：这次代表包括各阶层人民代表的产生经过选举、加聘，会议上真正呼吸到了民主的空气。我们必须实行毛主席的路线，分清忠奸。解放前与反动派不合作及消极是对的；今天则必须积极为人民服务，不骑墙、不投机、立场明朗。士绅代表吴伯扬说：“我们必须勤劳。唯勤劳才能生活。现在帝国主义没落，社会主义兴盛，大家要走光明大道。”又一士绅代表朱叔建发言中，批驳某些过于照顾地主本身利益的意见，他说：“你们过去残酷剥削农民，使农民贫穷，生产萎缩；现在在负担问题上又不顾人民解放战争的需要，而斤斤较量！”文教代表沈天默、沈雨若都说：只有农民生活改善，教育事业才能发达。教师要利用余闲时间，推行农民与职工的义务教育。初中学生与小朋友要在学校与新民主主义青年团领导下，为农民服务。自由职业代表张致牌说：“工农是社会一切财富的创造者，他们最有知识，而我们穿长袍、穿西装的却往往是比较没有知识的，大家必须向工农学习。”妇女代表姜兆麟说：“松江妇女应当在共产党领导下组织起来，积极参加生产；知识妇女要下乡服务，参加农民翻身运动。”青年代表张榴桃、徐瑞应发言说：“大地主感到租米减少生活苦了，实在他们的生活并不苦。减租必须彻底实行，使农家的儿童、青年都能读书。”基督教徒赵宗祝说：“我亲眼看到人民政府尊重信教自由，保护教会，深为感激。今后当好好遵守人民政府法令。”在发言中工农代表充分表现了他们的伟大胸怀和主人翁气概。如职工代表汤成贵、刘程生等说：“这次会议证明广大人民在政治上都翻了身，今后大家必须团结一致为实现剿灭土匪、肃清特务、合理负担、生产救灾、减租减息、改造基层政权、加强城乡互助等任务而奋斗。”“要使松江这一消费城市变成生产城市，我们工人阶级要忍受暂时的困难，努力生产，资方也应当积极经营业务，共同克服帝国主义与反动派封锁破坏等所加给我们的困难。”在有一个士绅代表发表了“农民破产，生活贫困的基本原因是农民不务正业，好吃懒做所造成的”的意见之后，农民代表沈一青起来回答说：“我是个赤脚农民，代表农民阶级讲几句话。在反动政府统治下，除重租、高利外，还有军米、壮丁米、自治费、枪捐等等，剥削得我们喘不过气来。我们没有钱下肥，收获逐年减少，物价高涨，农民到处吃亏。请各位代表想想：我们到底是怎样穷的？”台下代表们高呼：“受反动派和地主剥削穷的！”沈一青问：“到底谁是好吃懒做？”台下代表们高呼：“大地主好吃懒做！”沈一青接着说：“对呀！真正使我们穷困，真正好吃懒做的就是他们。他们自己过着富贵荣华的生活，而我们却整年辛苦不得一饱。这些我们都不再计较，但今年却一定要肃清土匪特务，打倒恶霸，彻底减租，希望工人兄弟、革命知识分子和各界民主人士协助我们。”
    　　　　各项决议
    十月四日下午继续开会，除一致表示拥护中共松江县委会书记余克关于今后工作方针与任务的报告及陆县长关于四个月来松江县人民政府施政报告外，并通过下列各项决议。计：（一）拥护“苏南行政区行政公署一九四九年征收公粮公草修正办法”，并通过“松江县一九四九年征收公粮公草实施补充办法修正案”。在该案中，大会根据各方意见，规定了赋额的起征点：不足二元者免征秋季公粮公草，并减轻了中农及中小地主的累进负担。（二）全体一致拥护“华东新区农村减租暂行条例草案”，并根据全体农民代表的提案，通过了“松江县具体实施减租减息补充规定”。在该补充规定中，大会采纳了各方有益的意见。（三）拥护上海军管会所公布的“关于私营企业劳资争议调处程序暂行办法”和“关于复工复业纠纷处理暂行办法”，并建议政府根据松江情况拟定实施补充办法，交下届大会讨论。（四）通过在大会闭幕之后，主席团为驻会委员会，直到第二次会议开幕前为止。并通过设立生产救灾、文化教育、复工复业与劳资关系及税务整理等问题的研究委员会，在驻会委员会领导下进行工作。
    大会期间即收到各代表提案一百六十五件，其中计文教三十二件，生产救灾三十件，劳资关系二十件，医药卫生十八件，财经税务十六件，工商十四件，治安七件，其他十四件。又最后收到的十四件尚未及分类。大会于一致通过各项决议后，由陆县长讲话。他向全体代表对政府的信任表示感谢，并诚恳接受大会的各种决议。最后由余克代表主席团致闭幕词。他指出大会因全体代表的团结一致，开诚商讨，而获得成功。希望代表们回去将大会精神及决议向各界群众普遍传达，把大会的决议变成为全县群众的行动。至此经过五天热烈讨论的松江各界人民空前团结的盛会宣告胜利闭幕。
    　　　　会后反映
    会后，工农代表们认为：“这次大会有五好：一好，是工农地位提高好；二好，是各界人民团结好；三好，是听到党政军首长的报告好；四好，是翻身的道理与办法定得好；五好，是会议期间生活照顾好。”士绅代表们说：“在开会前，我们以为这次会还不是和国民党的参议会一样，由政府先做好了框子，开会时向我们头上一套；真想不到有这样的民主。”文化教育界代表们说：“这次会议充分表现了共产党领导的正确，工农阶级的伟大，等于给我们上了一次最好的大课。”
