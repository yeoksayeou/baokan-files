Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 24th: TASS reports: October 20th marked the anniversary of the Soviet government and the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) Central Committee's decision regarding the "Plan for Creating Forest Shelter Belts and Implementing Crop and Pasture Rotation Systems." This plan, formulated under the great Stalin's initiative and direct guidance, stipulates a fundamental transformation of nature in the steppe regions of the European part of the Soviet Union to guarantee bumper harvests every year. This area encompasses approximately 80,000 collective farms and 120 million hectares of land. The area exceeds the total area of many European countries combined. According to the plan, over fifteen years, eight major state-owned forest shelter belts will be planted in this region, each ranging from over 900 kilometers to over 1,000 kilometers in length. The total length of all state-owned forest shelter belts will be 18,000 kilometers. These forest belts will prevent wind disasters, protect farmland from desertification, and gradually increase soil moisture. Vast forest belts will stretch from the Ural River along the Volga, Don, and Donets Rivers to the shores of the Caspian Sea. In addition, nearly six million hectares of forest shelter belts will be planted on the land of collective farms and state farms. Simultaneously, during this period, it is necessary to develop crop and pasture rotation systems and construct 44,228 ponds and reservoirs.

This year, the immense task of allocating land for the creation of state-owned forest shelter belts has been completed ahead of schedule. All areas prepared for afforestation have been carefully measured and studied. This spring, the first batch of hundreds of hectares of land has already been planted with trees. Autumn afforestation work has now begun. In the past year, one hundred and thirty-six state afforestation stations have been established. These stations are equipped with the latest machinery. They have thousands of tractors, tree-planting machines, and artificial sprinkler trucks. Each station serves one hundred to two hundred collective and state farms. Within a year, they have cultivated more than 1.6 million hectares of land for planting shelter belts and trees on sloping hillsides. These stations also help collective farms build ponds and reservoirs. Soviet scientists have made great contributions to the nationwide movement to complete the plan to transform nature. They have discovered many methods to accelerate afforestation in the steppe region. Academician Lysenko has suggested implementing effective tree-planting methods, which have increased the speed of building forest shelter belts by approximately two times. Now, Lysenko's method has become the main method of afforestation in the steppe regions of the Soviet Union.

Collective farms have also completed and exceeded this year's afforestation plan ahead of schedule. This spring, they planted more than 280,000 hectares of forest and prepared another 540,000 hectares of land for future afforestation. For example, in the Rostov Oblast, last year's afforestation exceeded by 49 percent, and autumn afforestation and planting oak forests in sandy areas have now begun. Afforestation in the Stalingrad, Astrakhan, and Central Asian regions is also progressing smoothly.

More than three hundred ponds and reservoirs have been built in collective farms and state farms. The area planted with perennial grasses has been expanded throughout the country to ensure the rapid implementation of crop and pasture rotation systems.

　　改造欧洲草原区保证年年丰收
  　苏联完成今年造林计划
    百三十座国家造林站业已建立
    【新华社北京二十四日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：十月二十日是苏联政府和联共（布）党中央委员会通过关于“创建森林防护带和实行农作物与牧草轮种制计划”决定的周年纪念，这一在伟大的斯大林的创议和直接指导之下制订的计划，规定要根本改造苏联欧洲部分草原地区的自然，以保证年年丰收。这一区域内约有八万个集体农庄和一亿二千万公顷土地。这一区域的面积超过许多欧洲国家面积的总和。根据计划，在十五年中，将在这一地区植造八条主要的国有森林防护带，每条森林防护带长远九百余公里至一千余公里。全部国有森林防护带的总长共为一万八千公里。这些森林带将防止风灾，保护农田免受流沙侵害，并渐渐增加土壤的水分。广大的森林带将由乌拉尔河沿伏尔加河、顿河和顿尼茨河岸到达里海边。此外，在集体农场和国营农场的土地上，将种植近六百万公顷的森林防护带。同时，在这一段时间内，必须发展农作物与牧草轮种制，建造四万四千二百二十八个水塘和储水池。
    今年，已提前完成了为创立国有森林防护带的分拨土地的巨大工作。一切准备造林的地区已仔细地加以测量和研究。今年春天，第一批数百公顷的土地已经植树了。现已开始秋季植树工作。一年以来，已成立了一百三十六座国家造林站。这些站装置有最新式的机器。他们有数以千计的拖拉机，植树机，及人工洒水车等。每一个站都为一百至二百个集体及国家农场服务。一年之内，他们已经为防护带和在多洞的山坡上植树而耕耘了一百六十多万公顷的土地。这些站也帮助集体农场建筑池塘和蓄水池。苏联科学家对全国性的完成改造自然计划的运动，有很大的贡献。他们发现许多加速草原造林的方法。科学院院士李森科建议实行有效的树种种植法，使建造森林防护带的速度约增加了两倍。现在，李森科的方法，已成为苏联在草原地区造林的主要方法。
    集体农场亦已提前完成并超过今年全年的造林计划。今年春天，即种植了二十八万多公顷的森林，并且又准备了五十四万公顷土地，以便将来造林。例如在罗斯多夫省，去年的造林超过了百分之四十九，现又开始了秋季造林和在沙地中种植橡树林。斯大林格勒、阿斯特拉罕及中亚细亚地区的造林也在顺利地进行。
    集体农场和国营农场中已建筑了三百多个水塘和储水池。种植多年生青草的地区已扩展到各地，以保证迅速实行农作物与牧草轮种制。
