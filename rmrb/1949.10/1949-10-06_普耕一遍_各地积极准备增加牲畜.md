　　Extensive Plowing Once
    Various Regions Actively Prepare to Increase Livestock
    Autumn plowing has begun in some areas. Many places have put forward slogans such as "If one family doesn't do autumn plowing, a thousand families will suffer from pests" and "Plow the land well this year for a good harvest next year." In order to achieve the plan of plowing once extensively, various regions are actively preparing to increase livestock, calling for "sharing yokes" and "selling yokes." In the Chabei New District, to prevent a few landlords and rich peasants from not carrying out autumn plowing, the slogan "Whoever harvests, plows" is proposed. In most areas, due to the confirmation of land rights and the reduction of corvée labor, especially in the arrangement of the "Three Autumns" work in some areas, the experience of summer production has been summarized, and the leadership of the branches has been commended. The enthusiasm of cadres and the masses is very high.

　　普耕一遍
    各地积极准备增加牲畜
    秋耕工作在部分地区已开始。许多地方提出：“一家不秋耕，千家受虫害”，“今年耕好地，明年好收成”的口号。为实现普耕一遍的计划，各地都积极准备增加牲畜，号召“合犋”、“卖犋”。察北新区为防止少数地主富农不进行秋耕，提出“谁收谁耕”。大部地区则由于地权确定，勤务减少，特别是部分地区三秋工作布置中，总结了夏季生产的经验，评奖了支部的领导，干部、群众情绪均极高涨。
