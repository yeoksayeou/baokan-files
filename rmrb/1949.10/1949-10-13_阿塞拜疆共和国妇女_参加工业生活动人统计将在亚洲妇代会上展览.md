Xinhua News Agency, Baku: In preparation for the upcoming Asian Women's Representative Conference, Azerbaijan has created compelling statistics reflecting the participation of women in the republic's industrial life.

Of the tens of thousands of women working in Azerbaijan's factories, one in ten is an engineer, technician, foreman, or laboratory employee. Many women manage enterprises. Among the female engineers, there are specialists in various fields, such as chemical engineers, construction engineers, and design experts. Thirty-seven outstanding female engineers have been recognized for their scientific research. Young women and women in Azerbaijan also constitute a significant portion of the students in technical education institutions.

Talented women are rapidly rising to leadership positions. For example, Manidova, a worker's daughter, became an assistant technician after graduating from a petroleum technology school. After several years of work, she acquired in-depth knowledge of refining petroleum products and is now the director of a large department. Due to her achievements and efforts in production, Manidova has been awarded the Order of Lenin by the Soviet government. As an active social worker, she has been elected as a representative to the Republic's Supreme Soviet. Another Supreme Soviet representative is female engineer-geologist Gusegova, and several representatives to the Baku City Soviet are also female engineers.

　　阿塞拜疆共和国妇女
    参加工业生活动人统计将在亚洲妇代会上展览
    【新华社北京十二日电】塔斯社巴库讯：为了即将来临的亚洲妇女代表会议，阿塞拜疆已制作了反映妇女参加该共和国工业生活的动人的统计。
    在阿塞拜疆各工厂中工作的成千成万妇女中，每十个就有一个是工程师、技师、领班或者是试验室的职员。许多妇女经理着企业。在女工程师当中，有各种不同的专家，如化学工程师、建筑工程师、设计专家等。有三十七个杰出的女工程师已因为她们的科学研究而获得了褒奖。阿塞拜疆的女青年和妇女在技术教育机关中也占学生数目的很大一部分。
    有才能的妇女正迅速跃升至领导地位上。例如马尼多娃，一个工人的女儿，她从石油技术学校毕业后，就当助理技师。经过几年的工作，她获得了制炼石油产品的精深知识，而现在已经是一个大部门的主任了。因为她在生产上的成就和努力，马尼多娃已获得苏联政府颁发的列宁奖章。作为一个积极的社会工作者，她已当选为共和国最高苏维埃代表。另外一个最高苏维埃代表是女工程师地质学者古谢格娃，首都巴库市苏维埃的若干代表，也是女工程师。
