The fifth issue of "North China Literature and Art" contains Yu Pingbo's "Some Problems in New Literature Writing," which mentions that new literature serves workers, peasants, and soldiers. Therefore, it should use their lives as subject matter and be written for them to read. Since it is written for them to read, it must use their language to be more effective, which leads to the issue of "spoken language" (dialect). He cited novels from old liberated areas as examples, saying: Writing in spoken language is inconvenient for reading. For example, in Ouyang Shan's "Xiao Bowen": "Before the Republic of China, his family was still a small landlord. Anyway, after that, for some unclear reason, his family's business 'drummed,' and his parents also died."

The word "鼓" (gǔ, drum) in the text becomes an obstacle to reading because no dictionary or thesaurus defines it as "decline." Mr. Pingbo believes this is a problem. In fact, I think this is not a problem of spoken language but of word usage. According to my reading experience, I believe that every word spoken is bound to have a corresponding character in the dictionary (at least the Kangxi Dictionary). Lao She's "Camel Xiangzi" has several special words that seem awkward, but when read aloud, they are everyday speech, only that he found the "correct characters."

Generally, authors are accustomed to making up words, only seeking phonetic similarity without regard to meaning. For example, "擤鼻涕" (xǐng bí tì, to blow one's nose) is often written as "醒" (xǐng, to wake up). Also, when it comes to "攒钱" (cuán qián, to save money), people always think that adding "立人儿" (lì rén ér, the "person" radical) is incorrect and that "＠手儿" (the "hand" radical) should be added instead, writing it as "攒" (zǎn). These are all instances of "being opinionated!" As in the example cited by Mr. Pingbo, the word "鼓" (gǔ, drum) may very well be "孤" (gū, lonely), "估" (gū, estimate), or "沽" (gū, to buy), as people in rural areas often pronounce level tones as rising tones and rising tones as level tones. For example, in Yang Shuo's recent novel "Northern Line," there is the phrase "压赛" (yā sài). I said it should be written as "亚赛" (yà sài), but the author said that people in that area (near Qinglong Bridge) all say "压赛" (yā sài). Saying it is fine, but writing it is not. For example, Beijing people say "拨落" (bō luò, to peel off) as "巴拉" (bā lā), but can we write it down phonetically? Also, "角落" (jiǎo luò, corner) is pronounced (Gālá), a word transmitted from the south to the north. Northerners still maintain its original characters and have not written it as "嘎拉儿" (gā lā ér). Also, the phrase "没落" (mò luò, decline) is also written into modern articles and not as "梅酪儿" (méi lào ér). Therefore, using spoken language in mass literature is not a problem. The problem lies in whether the author is willing to think about the words before using them.

　　口语用字问题
    青果
    “华北文艺”第五期俞平伯的“新文学写作的一些问题”，里面提到新文艺是给工农兵服务的，因此，要用他们的生活作题材，写给他们看。既然要写给他们看，就必须用他们的语言，才更能发生作用，于是就扯到“口语”（方言）问题。他曾举老解放区的小说为例，说：用口语写，发现阅读上不方便，如欧阳山的“小伯温”：“民国以前，他家还是个小地主。反正以后，说不清什么理由，他的家业就‘鼓’了，爹娘也死了。”
    文中的“鼓”字就成了阅读的障碍，因为查遍任何字典、辞源，鼓字也不作“衰落”讲。平伯先生认为这个成了问题。其实，我认为这个不是口语的问题，倒是用字的问题。据我的阅读经验，觉得凡是口里说出的话，字典（至少是康熙字典）里必定有那个字。老舍写的“骆驼祥子”，里面有几个特别字，看起来显得生硬，其实读出来便是日常所说的话，不过他找到“正字”罢了。
    一般作者用字，惯于瞎造，只求音对，不问字义。如“擤鼻涕”，多半把这个动词写作“醒”，又如“攒钱”（储蓄）人们总以为加“立人儿”不对，应加“＠手儿”，写作“攒”，这都是“师心自用”的地方！如平伯先生所举的例，那个“鼓”字未必不是应写作“孤”字、“估”字或“沽”字，乡间人惯将平声字读成上声字，上声字读成平声字。如最近出版的杨朔的小说“北线”，里面有“压赛”一辞，我说应写为“亚赛”，作者说那地方（青龙桥附近）都说“压赛”。说是可以，写不可以。如北京人对“拨落”说作“巴拉”，我们岂能照音写下来吗？又如“角落”（Ｇａｌａｒ），这是由南方向北传的字，北方人现在仍保持它的原字面儿，并没写成“嘎拉儿”。又如“没落”（Ｍｅｉｌａｏ）一辞，也写入现代文章里，并没写成“梅酪儿”。所以大众文艺用口语写不成问题，问题只在作者肯不肯对文字思索一下再用。
