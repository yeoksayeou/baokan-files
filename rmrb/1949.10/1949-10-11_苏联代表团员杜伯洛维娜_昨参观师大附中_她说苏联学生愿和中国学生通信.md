　　Soviet Delegation Member Dubrovina
　　Visited the High School Attached to the Normal University Yesterday
　　She said that Soviet Students are Willing to Communicate with Chinese Students.

　　[This newspaper reported] Yesterday (the 10th) morning at 9:00 AM, a member of the Soviet delegation, Deputy Minister of the Soviet People's Education Ministry, Dubrovina, visited the High School Attached to the Normal University. The students were extremely excited about the arrival of this international friend. They hung a banner written in Russian that said, "Long Live the Friendship Between the Two Great Nations of China and the Soviet Union," to express a warm welcome.

　　At 10:00 AM, all the students of the school gathered in the auditorium. Dubrovina walked into the venue amidst warm applause. First, Principal Hao delivered a welcome speech, expressing a warm welcome for her guidance. After that, Dubrovina made a short speech to all the teachers and students of the school.

　　She said: "Children, on behalf of the Soviet people, I extend friendly greetings to you. The Soviet people have always loved the Chinese people. Everyone in the Soviet Union knows that the Chinese people are the smartest, bravest, and most fond of labor. In the Soviet Union, from children to adults, everyone respects the Chinese Communist Party and the great people's leader, Mao Zedong. This time, the Soviet delegation arrived in Beijing, the capital of the liberated Chinese people. We are honored to have the opportunity to celebrate the founding of the People's Republic of China with you. Children, you all know that China has about 500 million people, and the Soviet Union has 200 million people. More than 700 million people united together is something that the British and American imperialists never dreamed of." Thunderous applause frequently erupted from the audience, interrupting her speech.

　　She continued: "When the Soviet delegation went abroad this time, the male and female students in our country asked us to tell them how Chinese students live and study after we return. Soviet students asked us to tell you that you must have good discipline when studying revolutionary theory. Because when the Soviet revolution succeeded, there was such a phenomenon, because there was democracy and freedom, they wanted to "enjoy" it for a while, which was wrong. We have stood up, we must have good discipline, do you agree?"

　　The students under the stage immediately replied clearly, "Agree!"

　　"Also, the Soviet people asked us to pay high respect to the Chinese education community and intellectuals. Soviet teachers occupy a very high position, and Chinese teachers are even greater because they are with the Chinese people, fighting together and seeking liberation together!"

　　"Before going abroad, Soviet students asked us to write down your school's address. They want to communicate with you. Do you agree?" The students immediately applauded to show their agreement when they heard this sentence.

　　"If you agree, I will tell them the address of the High School Attached to the Normal University."

　　The students applauded enthusiastically again.

　　"Now, I sincerely congratulate you, children, on studying hard, grasping scientific knowledge, and making yourselves smart and disciplined people. Your fathers and brothers have shed countless blood and sweat. They did it for your happiness. They have raised the flag of China high! Children! The cause left by your parents is for you to complete!"

　　Her every word was full of love and kindness. Finally, she and the students shouted together: "Long live the children of China, the youth of China!" "Long live the great Chinese people!" "Long live the great Soviet people!" "Long live the permanent friendship between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union!" She also shouted in Chinese: "Long live Comrade Stalin!" "Long live Mao Zedong!" Finally, the representatives of the student union presented her with a bouquet of flowers, and everyone walked out of the venue in warm applause.

　　苏联代表团员杜伯洛维娜
    昨参观师大附中
    她说苏联学生愿和中国学生通信
    【本报讯】昨日（十日）上午九点苏联代表团团员，苏联人民教育部副部长杜伯洛维娜，到师大附中参观。同学们为这位国际友人的到来感到莫大的兴奋。他们把用俄文写的“中苏两大民族友好万岁”的标语高悬在门口，表示热烈欢迎。
    十点钟全校同学齐集在大礼堂，杜伯洛维娜在热烈的掌声中走进会场，首先由郝校长致欢迎词，表示热烈欢迎来校指导。其后，杜伯洛维娜向全校师生作了一个简短的讲话。
    她说：“小朋友们：我代表苏联人民向你们致朋友的敬礼。苏联人民一向都是热爱中国人民的，苏联每个人都知道中国人民是最聪明的，最勇敢的，最喜爱劳动的。在苏联，由小孩子到大人都尊重中国共产党和伟大的人民领袖毛泽东。这一次苏联代表团到达解放后的中国人民首都北京，我们有机会和你们一起庆祝中华人民共和国的成立，这是很荣幸的。小朋友们，你们全知道中国约有五万万人民，苏联有两万万人民，七万万多的人民团结一起，这是美英帝国主义者所梦想不到的。”台下不时涌起雷动的掌声，打断了她的讲话。
    她接着说：“这一次苏联代表团出国的时候，我们国家的男女学生让我们回去以后，告诉他们中国学生是怎样生活，怎样读书。苏联学生让我们告诉你们，在学习革命理论的时候，要有好的纪律。因为在苏联革命成功的时候，便有这样的现象，因为民主了，自由了，便要“痛快”一下了，这是错误的，我们站起来了，我们要有好的纪律，你们同意吧？”
    台下同学们立刻清脆的回答“同意！”
    “还有，苏联人民让我们向中国教育界和知识分子致崇高的敬意，苏联教员占着很高地位，中国教员更伟大，因为他们与中国人民在一起共同战斗共同求解放！”
    “出国前，苏联学生让我们把你们学校的地址记下来，他们要与你们通信，你们同意吧？”同学们听到这句话立刻鼓起掌来表示同意。
    “你们同意，我就把师大附中的地址告诉他们。”
    同学们又热烈的鼓起掌来。
    “现在我衷心地祝贺小朋友们好好学习，把握科学知识，把自己造成聪明的有纪律的人。你们父兄曾流了无数血汗，他们就是为了你们的幸福，他们把中国的旗帜举得高高的！小朋友们！你们父母们所留下的事业，要你们来完成！”
    她的每句话充满了友爱和亲切。最后她与同学们一齐高呼：“中国儿童，中国青年万岁！”“伟大的中国人民万岁！”“伟大的苏联人民万岁！”“中苏两大民族永久友谊万岁！”她并且用中国话高呼：“斯大林同志万岁！”“毛泽东万岁！”最后学生会的代表把一束鲜花献给她，大家在热烈的掌声中走出了会场。
