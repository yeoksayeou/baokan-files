Outline for the 1949 Winter Literacy Campaign
    Issued by the North China People's Government, October 15, 1949

    (1) Goals and Tasks of This Year's Winter Literacy Education

    With the end of the war in North China, people's lives are stable, and a period of construction has begun. Most areas are old revolutionary base areas where land reform has been completed. The masses have a high enthusiasm for production and have accumulated some experience in restoring and developing production. This has created objective conditions for the masses' urgent need to learn, acquire culture, and further improve production techniques. There are also some new areas where the masses, after gaining liberation, are highly motivated, actively demanding land, and seeking to learn land reform policies to correctly implement land reform and create conditions for production and construction. On the other hand, there are still some negative factors among the masses. Their understanding of the country's future development after the victory of the revolution and the tasks of New Democratic construction is insufficient. Furthermore, the U.S. imperialism and Kuomintang reactionaries have sent bandits and special agents to carry out sabotage using superstitious sects and hooligans, which hinders the masses' recovery and development of production. These problems not only need to be solved promptly and individually but also require a fundamental solution through education, raising the masses' awareness, and addressing them ideologically and politically. This will more fully enhance their production enthusiasm and enable them to engage in production and construction, consolidate North China, and prepare the foundation for the large-scale production movement next year. Therefore, this entire winter, we must widely launch a fervent winter literacy campaign in rural North China (regardless of old or new areas). The purpose and task of this year's winter literacy campaign is to further enhance the masses' political awareness from a positive perspective, inspire their initiative, ensure the completion of winter tasks, and guide them to actively engage in production and construction, consolidate North China, and prepare the foundation for next year's large-scale production movement.

    (2) Content and Focus of This Year's Winter Literacy Education

    Regardless of old or new areas, this year's winter literacy campaign should universally carry out political education and production education. Old areas should focus on education in production, cultural, and scientific knowledge. New areas should focus on political and ideological education and land reform education.

    Political Education Content: The masses should be universally educated about the birth of the People's Republic of China, fostering love for the People's Republic of China. They should learn to sing the national anthem and understand and cherish the national flag. They should support their own people's government and abide by its laws and decrees. The masses should be educated about the people's congresses and representative conferences of all sectors to be held in various places this winter. Preparations should be made in the winter literacy campaign beforehand, and discussions should be held in the winter literacy campaign after the meetings. Farmers should be educated to understand how to win over, educate, and reform landlords and rich peasants, and strengthen rural unity. They should understand that the enemy is absolutely unwilling to accept defeat, and the U.S.-led imperialist bloc is still helping the remnants of the reactionaries, organizing secret agents and spies, to carry out sabotage. They must raise their vigilance against the conspiracies of the U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries and pay attention to preventing traitors and spies. They should understand that the Soviet Union, the Eastern European New Democratic countries, and the people of all countries are our best friends. Political education should also include ideological education on the prospects of production, and the use of newspapers to organize reading and explain major domestic and international events to the masses. The purpose of this political education is to eliminate ideological obstacles to production.

    Production Education Content: First, production ideological education should be conducted to make the masses understand that the founding of the new China is only the first step in a long march. The unprecedentedly huge production and construction work in Chinese history is still ahead, and now is only the beginning of this construction work. Make the masses understand that our construction goal is to realize industrialization and agricultural mechanization, and truly elevate the country from the past state of poverty and weakness to a state of prosperity and strength. Educate the farmers to have an overall concept, implement mutual assistance between urban and rural areas, and form a worker-peasant alliance. Make the masses understand that only with the development of industry can the countryside obtain machines and industrial necessities; only with the development of agriculture can factories obtain raw materials and food. Encourage the masses to plant industrial raw material crops, making them understand that this is beneficial to the country and also beneficial to themselves. Educate the masses to understand that in a considerably long historical period, China will still implement New Democracy, protect private property, and encourage legitimate private business. The claim that socialism will be implemented in two or three years is completely wrong. Make them understand that socialism is by no means egalitarianism of eating from a common pot. Use this to educate the masses, dispel ideological concerns, advocate production for prosperity, diligent family management, overcome poverty, overcome natural disasters, and oppose the erroneous ideas of "getting rich without getting wealthy" and "producing without thrift." Second, attention should be paid to educating the masses to improve their production technical knowledge. Invite agricultural experts and labor heroes, production models to explain to the masses agricultural scientific knowledge such as protecting and developing livestock, building water conservancy projects, improving agricultural tools, varieties, increasing fertilizers, and preventing diseases and insect pests, as well as improving production experience. Make full use of favorable conditions to educate the masses to increase their technical knowledge of production. Gather masses who are doing well in agricultural production, especially those who have profited greatly from growing industrial raw material crops, hold forums to spread the experience of planting raw material crops, and encourage the masses to plant raw material crops. Gather masses who are doing well in mutual assistance and cooperation, exchange experiences, and promote mutual assistance and cooperation movements that are truly developed on the basis of equivalent mutual benefit. And it is necessary to combine the specific work of winter production to carry out education on sideline production that is beneficial and promising.

    Land Reform Education in New Areas: It should be carried out in conjunction with land reform work. The content of education should be to explain classes to the masses, inspire them to speak out about their grievances, and make them realize that feudal exploitation is the root cause of the masses' inability to produce and become wealthy. Inspire the masses' class consciousness and encourage them to unite to carry out the land reform struggle. Publicize the policy of "leaving the middle untouched and leveling both ends," explain the policies clearly, explain the attitude towards each class clearly, distinguish the boundaries between landlords, old rich peasants, and middle peasants, so that the masses can correctly use the weapons of struggle, and prevent repeating past mistakes ideologically and politically. At the same time, explain clearly that land reform is for production, and only by saving production can life be improved, with both people and wealth flourishing, so as to avoid wasting the fruits.

    Cultural Education: In the old areas, in accordance with the needs and conditions of the masses, they should be educated to recognize and write characters, learn abacus or arithmetic, and explain scientific common sense and hygiene common sense, and gradually overcome the ideas of feudal superstition. We should also select areas with better foundations for winter literacy campaigns and people's schools, and carry out the work of eliminating illiteracy among young people in a planned, focused, and step-by-step manner, creating experience in eliminating illiteracy. In areas that have been determined to eliminate illiteracy, we should strive to ensure that all young people under the age of 25 can recognize 1,000 commonly used characters, can understand ordinary news and popular reading materials in local newspapers, can write simple letters, and can keep accounts and calculate accounts in about three years. New areas should not overemphasize cultural education and should carry it out appropriately according to the needs of the masses.

    In the winter literacy campaign in disaster areas, attention should be paid to production and disaster relief education, and the methods should also be flexible and need to be combined with production and disaster relief work.

    (3) Several Specific Issues

    To run the winter literacy campaign well, it is necessary to seriously solve the following problems based on the experience of running winter literacy campaigns in previous years and the current possible conditions.

    1. Textbook Issues: The first is to prepare textbooks. Literacy textbooks have been uniformly compiled by the Ministry of Education. Political and production textbooks should be compiled by each province and city in accordance with the above content and the specific situation and work steps of the region, with emphasis, and reviewed by each province and city themselves, and can be continuously published in local newspapers.

    2. Teacher Issues: Winter literacy teachers are of decisive significance in running the winter literacy campaign well. In previous years, the quality of winter literacy teachers was poor, and teaching was difficult. This year's winter literacy campaign should select and hire suitable people to take on different roles according to the content of education. Village cadres should take on the political education of the masses, using what they have learned in their own winter training to educate the masses. Each district can regularly convene winter literacy teachers to conduct preparatory lessons, learning before teaching. Cultural classes should be taken by those with higher cultural levels in the village. If no one is available, primary school teachers can preside over the teaching using the "little teacher" system. In order to solve the difficulties of winter literacy teachers' lives and production, the method of exchanging labor production can be implemented. Material or spiritual rewards should be given to winter literacy teachers with excellent results.

    3. Funding Issues: The winter literacy campaign must have some funding. This year's winter literacy campaign should allocate a portion of the county's local education funding as winter literacy bonuses, training teachers, textbooks used by teachers, and expenses such as kerosene and chalk during class. Expenses will be paid for those who have winter literacy teachers. The textbooks and heating costs used by the masses should be solved by the masses themselves. The use of funds should still be based on the principle of thrift and shall not be wasted.

    4. Leadership Issues: Governments at all levels must attach sufficient importance to the important significance of this year's winter literacy campaign. The winter literacy campaign should be regarded as a place for ideological mobilization, eliminating the erroneous view of opposing the winter literacy campaign with central work, and also preventing the erroneous practice of turning the winter literacy campaign into a place for simply arranging work and solving administrative problems. The leadership structure should be as simple as possible and truly play a role. It can be presided over by the education administrative departments at all levels, and relevant parties can be convened to discuss and decide on implementation separately when necessary. It is necessary to be responsible for solving the difficulties in winter literacy work and teaching, responsible for inspecting winter literacy work, and timely organizing reports and exchanging experience in winter literacy work.

    To carry out the winter literacy campaign, it is necessary to correctly implement the mass line. Attention should be paid to closely combining it with the winter activities of the masses, otherwise the winter literacy work will definitely not be done well. We should inspire the masses to consciously enroll in school and strictly prevent coercion and commandism and punishmentism. Winter literacy teaching should strive for practical results, and the methods should be flexible, preventing formalism. In general, in addition to adopting regular collective classes, those who cannot participate in collective classes can be organized to study separately by active members in the study. Study groups can be organized according to production organizations or residential addresses, especially in disaster-stricken areas. And it can use broadcasting, slides, drum lyrics, yangko and other forms loved by the masses to supplement learning.

    Although many areas have suffered disasters this year, the war service task has been cancelled. Regardless of old or new areas, the masses have learning requirements and have past winter literacy experience. We can and should create the winter literacy campaign into a learning movement that runs through the entire winter. [Newsroom, North China Government]

### 一九四九年冬学运动实施纲要

　　一九四九年冬学运动实施纲要
    华北人民政府颁发一九四九年十月十五日
    （一）今年冬学教育的目的与任务
    华北战争结束，人民生活安定，建设时期开始，绝大部分地区为老区，土改完成，群众生产情绪很高，并已有一定的恢复和发展生产的经验，因此造成群众迫切地要求学习，要求文化，要求进一步提高生产技术的客观条件。还有一部分新区，群众在获得解放后，情绪很高，积极要求土地，并要求学习土改政策，以便正确执行土地改革，为生产建设创造条件。另一方面，群众中还存在一些消极因素，对于革命胜利以后国家发展的前途了解不够，对于新民主主义建设的任务了解不够，加以美帝国主义及国民党反动派派遣匪特利用迷信会门及流氓等进行破坏，成为群众恢复与发展生产的障碍。这些问题不仅需要及时地个别地加以解决，更需要从教育着手，提高群众觉悟，从思想上政治上予以根本解决，以便能更充分地提高生产热情，进行生产。因此，今年整个冬季，我们必须在华北农村（不论老区新区）广泛地开展热烈的冬学运动。今年冬学的目的与任务，就在于通过冬学运动，从积极方面进一步提高群众的政治觉悟，启发群众的积极性，保证冬季工作完成，并引导群众积极地去进行生产建设，巩固华北，为明年的大生产运动准备基础。
    （二）今年冬学教育的内容与重点
    无论老区与新区，今年冬学均应普遍的进行政治教育与生产教育。老区应着重于生产与文化科学知识的教育，新区应着重于政治思想教育与土改教育。
    政治教育内容：应教育群众普遍知道中华人民共和国的诞生，热爱中华人民共和国，学会唱国歌，了解与爱护国旗；拥护人民自己的政府，遵守自己政府的法令。应教育群众今冬各地的人民代表大会和各界代表会议，事前应在冬学中酝酿，会后应在冬学中传达讨论。应教育农民懂得如何争取教育改造地主、富农，加强农村团结。懂得敌人绝不甘心失败，以美国为首的帝国主义集团，仍在帮助反动派残余势力，组织特务间谍，进行破坏，必须提高对美蒋反动派阴谋的警惕，注意防奸防特。懂得苏联、东欧新民主主义国家及各国人民都是我们最好的朋友。政治教育还应包括生产前途的思想教育，并利用报纸，组织读报，随时向群众讲解国内外重大事件的时事教育。这些政治教育的目的，在于扫除生产上的思想障碍。
    生产教育内容：第一应进行生产的思想教育，使群众了解新中国的成立，只是万里长征走完了头一步，中国历史上从来没有过的巨大的生产建设工作还在前面，现在只是这个建设工作的开始。使群众了解我们的建设目标是实行工业化与农业机械化，把国家从过去贫弱的状态真正提高到富强的地位。教育农民有整体观念，实行城乡互助，工农联盟。使群众懂得只有工业发展，农村才能获得机器及工业必需品；只有农业发展，工厂才能获得原料及粮食。鼓励群众种植工业原料作物，使其懂得这对国家有利，对自己也有利。教育群众使其了解在相当长的历史时期中，中国还是实行新民主主义，保护私有财产，鼓励私人的合法经营，二、三年后即实行社会主义的说法，是完全错误的。使其懂得社会主义也决不是吃大锅饭的均产主义。以此教育群众，解除思想顾虑，提倡生产致富，勤俭发家，战胜贫困，战胜灾荒，反对“发家不致富”，“生产不节约”的错误思想。第二应注意进行提高群众生产技术知识的教育。邀请农业专家及劳动英雄、生产模范给群众讲解保护与发展牲畜、兴修水利、改良农具、品种、增加肥料及防止病虫害等农业科学知识与改进生产的经验。尽量利用有利条件，教育群众增加生产的技术知识。集合农业生产搞得好的，特别是种工业原料作物获利大的群众，举行座谈，传播种植原料作物的经验，鼓励群众种植原料作物。集合互助合作搞得好的群众，交流经验，提倡真正在等价互利基础上发展起来的互助合作运动。并要结合冬季生产的具体工作，进行有利益有前途的副业生产的教育。
    新区的土改教育：应结合土改工作进行。教育内容，应是向群众讲解阶级，启发诉苦，使群众认识封建剥削是群众不能生产致富的根本原因。启发群众的阶级觉悟，鼓励其团结起来进行土改斗争。向群众宣传实行中间不动两头平的方针，讲清政策，讲清对各阶级的态度，分清地主、旧富农、中农的界线，使群众能正确运用斗争武器，从思想上政策上防止重犯过去的错误。同时讲清土改是为了生产，只有节约生产，才能改善生活，人财两旺，以免浪费果实。
    文化教育：在老区，应按群众需要和条件，教育群众识字、写字，学珠算或笔算，讲解科学常识卫生常识，逐渐克服封建迷信的思想。还应选择冬学民校基础较好的地区，有计划、有重点、有步骤地进行扫除青年文盲工作，创造扫除文盲工作的经验。已确定为扫盲的地区，争取三年左右，使所有二十五岁以下的青年都能认得一千个群众常用的字，能看懂地方报纸的普通新闻和通俗读物，能写简单的信，能记帐算帐。新区不应过分强调文化教育，应视群众要求适当进行。
    灾区冬学，应注意生产救灾的教育，方式也须灵活，需与生产救灾工作结合进行。
    （三）几个具体问题
    要办好冬学，必须根据历年办冬学的经验与当前可能的条件，认真地解决以下几个问题。
    １、教材问题：首先是准备教材，识字课本已由教育部统一编写。政治与生产教材应由各省市根据上述内容与本区具体情况、工作步骤，有重点地编写，由各省市自己审查，并可在地方报纸上连续登载。
    ２、教员问题：冬学教员，在办好冬学上有决定意义。历年冬学教员，质量均差，教学困难。今年冬学应按教育内容，选聘适宜的人来分别担任。村干部应担任群众的政治教育，用自己冬训所学的东西来教育群众。各区可以定期召集冬学教员，进行准备课，先学后教。文化课由村中文化水平较高者担任。确无人担任时，可由小学教员主持，采用小先生制，进行教学。为了解决冬学教员的生活生产困难，可实行换工生产的办法。对于成绩优良的冬学教员，应给予物质的或精神的奖励。
    ３、经费问题：冬学必须要有一部分经费。今年冬学应从县地方教育经费项下拨出一部分经费，作冬学奖金，训练教员、教员所用课本与上课时灯油粉笔等项费用。有冬学者，即予开支。群众所用课本及烤火费用，群众自己解决。经费使用，仍本节约原则，不得浪费。
    ４、领导问题：各级政府对今年冬学的重要意义，必须有足够的重视。应将冬学当做思想动员的场所，消除将冬学与中心工作对立的错误看法，同时也防止将冬学变成单纯布置工作解决行政问题的场所的错误做法。领导机构要力求简单，要真正能起作用，可由各级教育行政部门负责主持，必要时召集有关方面讨论，决定后分头执行。要负责解决冬学工作上及教学上的困难，负责检查冬学工作，并及时组织报导，交流冬学工作经验。
    开展冬学运动，必须正确执行群众路线。应注意与群众的冬季活动密切结合，否则冬学工作一定作不好。应启发群众自觉入学，严格防止强迫命令与惩罚主义。冬学教学，应力求实效，方式务求灵活，防止形式主义。一般除采用定期集体上课外，其有不能参加集体上课者，可由学习中的积极分子分头去组织他们学习。学习小组，可按生产组织或居住地址组织起来，灾荒地区，尤应注意。并可用广播、幻灯、鼓词、秧歌等群众喜爱的形式，补助学习。
    今年虽有不少地区发生灾荒，但战勤任务取消，无论老区新区群众都有学习要求，又有过去冬学经验，我们是可以并应当把冬学造成一个贯彻整个冬季的学习运动。　　　　　【华府新闻室】
