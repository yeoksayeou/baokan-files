　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 12th. The investigation committee, composed of representatives from democratic parties and people's organizations in North and South Korea, has just released a report of over ten thousand words, using irrefutable facts to expose the Syngman Rhee traitorous government's conspiracy, with the support of the United States, to provoke a civil war and undermine the peaceful reunification of Korea along the 38th parallel. The investigation committee was formed based on the decision of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland of Korea on August 1st. For more than two months, the committee went to the area along the 38th parallel to investigate the truth of the provocations by the Syngman Rhee army of South Korea, and visited the affected residents along the line. The report pointed out that from January to September of this year, Syngman Rhee instigated his army and police, numbering more than 49,000, to launch 432 attacks along the 38th parallel, causing innocent residents in 13 counties, 45 subdistricts (areas), and 136 villages (townships) in North Korea to suffer armed aggression. In addition, they suffered 71 air raids and 42 fleet attacks. The report pointed out that the Syngman Rhee reactionary clique systematically provoked armed conflicts, intruded into areas north of the 38th parallel to disrupt the lives of the North Korean people, deliberately created tense situations, and propagated that the People's Army "invaded South Korea," attempting to use this to cover up their conspiracy to obstruct the peaceful reunification movement and launch a civil war. The report sternly denounced US imperialism for doing its utmost to interfere in Korea's internal affairs. US military advisers not only armed the reactionary army of South Korea, but also directly participated in the armed aggression along the 38th parallel.

　　朝鲜各党派委会发表调查报告
    揭露李承晚挑衅罪行  严斥美帝干涉阴谋
    【新华社平壤十二日电】由南北朝鲜各民主党派与人民团体代表组成的调查委员会，顷发表长达万余字的报告书，以无可辩驳的事实，揭露李承晚卖国政府在美国支持下，在北纬三十八度一线挑拨内战、破坏朝鲜和平统一的阴谋。调查委员会是根据朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线八月一日的决定组成的。两个多月来，该委员会曾至“三八”线沿线，调查南朝鲜李承晚军挑衅的真相，访问了沿线的受害居民。报告书指出：从本年一月到九月，李承晚嗾使其军队和警察四万九千余人，在“三八”线沿线发动了四百三十二次的进攻，使北朝鲜的十三个郡四十五个面（区）一百三十六个里（乡）的无辜居民，遭到了武装侵袭。此外，并遭到七十一次的飞机轰炸和四十二次的舰队袭击。报告书指出：李承晚反动集团有计划地挑拨武装冲突事件，侵入“三八”线以北地区扰乱北鲜人民的生活，故意制造紧张情势，并宣传人民军队“侵犯南鲜”，妄图借此来掩盖其妨害和平统一运动和发动内战的阴谋。报告书严正地指斥美帝国主义正竭力干涉朝鲜内政。美国军事顾问不但武装了南朝鲜的反动军队，并且直接参加了“三八”线的武装侵袭。
