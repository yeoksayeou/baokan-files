Mayor Huang Jing first expressed a warm welcome on behalf of the people of Tianjin. He said: We feel very honored to have this meeting today to welcome our Soviet friends. The Chinese people's revolutionary cause has received a lot of help from the Soviet Union.

Mayor Huang Jing then said: The People's Liberation War will soon achieve a nationwide victory. Our people are engaged in restoration and construction work and are in great need of the friendly assistance of the Soviet Union. We firmly believe that this assistance will greatly contribute to the construction of the new China. Then, the representative of the Soviet engineers, Mr. Sidorov, delivered a speech. He said: We cannot express how touched we are by the Chinese friends' warm reception. When we arrived in China, we felt like we were in the home of our own brothers. We have come to China with only one task, which is to learn from our Chinese comrades and at the same time pass on the experience we have in the Soviet Union to China.
    We are confident that we will be able to accomplish this task.

    欢迎苏联工程师参加建设工作
    【新华社天津八日电】天津市人民政府今晚举行招待会，欢迎参加津市建设工作的苏联工程师。黄敬市长首先代表天津人民表示热烈的欢迎。他说：我们今天开会来欢迎苏联朋友，感到很光荣。中国人民的革命事业曾经得到苏联很多帮助。正是因为有了苏联的帮助，中国人民才取得了今天这样伟大的胜利。黄敬市长接着说：人民解放战争很快就要取得全国胜利。我国人民正在从事恢复和建设工作，极需要苏联的友谊帮助。我们深信这种帮助将大大有助于新中国的建设工作。接着，苏联工程师代表希得洛夫致词，他说：中国朋友对我们这样热情，我们的感动是说不出来的。我们到了中国，象到了自己兄弟的家里一样。我们到中国来只有一个任务，就是向中国同志们学习，同时把在苏联的经验传达到中国来。
    我们深信一定能够完成这一任务。
