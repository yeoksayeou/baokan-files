　　Introduction to Suburban Land Situation
　Leng Lin, compiled

　　The land in the suburbs of Beijing is mostly concentrated in the hands of a few landlords, bureaucrats, and warlords, and most peasants have only a small portion of the land. According to a survey of eight villages, these eight villages have a total of 1,683 households and 7,583 people, with a total of 27,361.7 mu of land. Landlords and rich peasants, totaling 154 households, occupy 13,905.4 mu, accounting for more than 50 percent of the total land, with an average of 13.7 mu per person; while poor peasants and farm laborers, totaling 886 households with 2,509 people, occupy only 3,142.0 mu, accounting for 1.6 percent of the total land, with an average of only 1.25 mu per person. Due to the increasing burden placed on peasants by landlords, warlords, and bureaucrats year by year, the peasants are becoming increasingly impoverished, and thus land is being concentrated more rapidly in the hands of landlords, warlords, and bureaucrats. For example, Wu Peifu, Duan Qirui, Feng Zhi'an and others all occupy large amounts of land in the suburbs. The great traitor Jiang Chaozong occupied 1,040 mu of land in Tuanhe, a village in Nan Yuan, and Li Shouxin occupied 2,100 mu in Siyi Zhuang, a village in Nan Yuan. This shows the concentration of land in the suburbs of Beijing and also explains the root cause of the poverty of the peasants in the suburbs. Therefore, when the peasants in the suburbs heard the news that land reform was about to be carried out, they were all overjoyed and actively prepared to carry out this great historical revolution under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, so as to improve the lives of the peasants, develop rural productivity, and change the face of the suburbs of the people's capital through land reform, in order to further move towards collectivization and socialization.

　　郊区土地情况介绍
  冷林整理
  北京市郊区的土地大都集中在少数地主官僚军阀手内，大多数农民只有很少的一部分土地。这由据八个村的调查，该八个村共一、六八三户，七、五八三口人，共有土地二七、三六一·七亩。而一五四户地主富农就占有一三、九○五·四亩，占土地总数百分之五十以上，平均每人一三·七亩；而贫雇农八八六户，二、五○九口人，仅占土地三、一四二·○亩，占土地总数百分之一·六，每人平均仅一·二五亩。由于地主军阀官僚放在农民身上的负担年有增加，因之农民日趋贫困，于是土地便更加迅速地集中在地主军阀官僚手内。如吴佩孚、段祺瑞、冯治安等在郊区都占有大量土地。大汉奸江朝宗在南苑的团河一个村就占有土地一、○四○亩，李守信在南苑四义庄一个村就占有二、一○○亩。这可看出京郊土地集中的情形，也可以说明郊区农民贫困的根源。因此，当郊区农民闻悉即将进行土地改革的消息时，莫不喜形于色，积极准备在中国共产党和人民政府领导下来进行这个历史的大革命。以便经过土地改革，改善农民的生活，发展农村生产力，改变人民首都的郊区面貌，以进一步的走向集体化、社会化的道路。
