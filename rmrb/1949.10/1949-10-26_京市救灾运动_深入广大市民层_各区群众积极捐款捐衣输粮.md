　　Beijing City Disaster Relief Movement
　　Penetrates the Broad Masses of Citizens
　　People in All Districts Actively Donate Money, Clothes, and Grain
　　[Our Newspaper] The disaster relief movement in Beijing City has penetrated the citizens. Mass meetings have been held in various districts and public security stations, where cadres from the CCP District Committees or District Public Offices have publicized the significance of disaster relief to everyone. Since the District Public Offices in the ten districts launched publicity work a few days ago, they have received enthusiastic responses from shops and citizens. On the 21st alone, Chaochang Coal Company and Qingrentang and other merchants donated 250 jin of millet, and Huazhen Company donated 500 jin of millet. Xiesheng donated 50,000 yuan in RMB. Tongquan, Dongmingxiang, Juxinglong, Guangyuanxiang and other merchants donated 40,000 yuan. Stall vendors also responded enthusiastically to the call. Stall vendors in Chongwai, Huashi, Tieba, and the Fahua Temple market also initiated disaster relief challenges to each other. Activists from the 14th and 16th police stations in the 9th district spontaneously organized propaganda teams, explaining the disaster situation in North China and the achievements of the farmers in the eight-year War of Resistance and the three-year War of Liberation, and put forward the slogan "Saving others is saving oneself." After publicity and mobilization, everyone immediately flocked to the police station to donate money and goods. The labor residents of the entire courtyard at No. 1 Sungiayuan, 13th Police Station, decided not to eat vegetables for one day and save the money for disaster relief. An old lady in her fifties or sixties said, "We know the suffering of hunger and cold, we cannot let the farmers who give us the greatest benefit suffer from hunger and cold!" Yan Yunfen, the manager of Tianlizeng Cloth Shop in Guanyin Temple, volunteered to go to various shops to publicize to the managers. Qiandexing Money Shop in Shijia Hutong voluntarily donated 500 jin of millet and 500,000 yuan in people's currency. On the evening of the 18th, the First Police Station of the Fifth Branch also convened a forum with 51 managers and householders from various shops under its jurisdiction. At the meeting, Pang Xiusheng, the owner of Yisheng Wool Shop, introduced the disaster situation he had witnessed in the disaster area and took the lead in donating 100,000 yuan. Under his influence, a total of 1.48 million yuan was donated in just two hours. As of now, citizens within the jurisdiction of the 13th Police Station have donated a total of 720,000 yuan. In the first forum of 23 citizens held by the Fifth Police Station in the Second District, 22 people voluntarily donated money on the spot, donating more than 100,000 yuan and many items such as flour, leather coats, and cotton quilt covers. In the 12th District, cadres and members of the Communist Youth League have been actively rehearsing theatrical programs in recent days, preparing to perform in Tianqiao and donate all ticket revenue to disaster relief.
