Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 24th: The autumn harvest in northern Jiangsu has basically concluded, with an average yield of 60% to 65%. Since the beginning of summer, various regions have suffered from successive wind, rain, and tidal disasters, resulting in approximately 17 million mu of autumn crops, accounting for one-third of the total cultivated land, being flooded. Despite the full efforts of the Party, government, military, and people to rescue the crops, the area of autumn crops with no harvest or reduced harvest still reached 6 to 7 million mu. The counties of Hai'an, Taizhou, Taixian, Sheyang, Jianyang, Fudong (newly established county in eastern Funing), Jiangdu, Yizheng, Chongming, and parts of Nantong have relatively good harvests, generally reaching 80%. The Huaian and Nantong districts suffered more severe disasters. The average cotton yield along the coast is only 30 to 40 jin of seed cotton per mu. Areas with lighter disasters, such as Sheyang, Fudong, Rudong (newly established county in eastern Rugao), and Qidong, can generally yield 70 to 100 jin. During the autumn harvest, Party committees at all levels systematically organized farmers in heavily affected areas to help with harvesting in lightly affected or non-disaster areas, initiated equal-value labor exchanges between early-autumn and late-autumn households, and between dryland and paddy field areas. They also mobilized substitute labor and contracted labor for the families of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, and workers with insufficient labor, promptly assisted widowed, orphaned, and disabled households in resolving difficulties, and urged landlords who had returned to participate in labor. As a result, the harvest time was greatly shortened. Currently, most dryland areas are actively preparing to harvest late-autumn crops. In waterlogged areas of Dongtai, Lianshui, Muyang, Suining, Yancheng, Fudong, Yangzhou, and other districts and townships, active drainage is underway to strive to sow wheat seeds around the time of the Frost's Descent, expanding the cultivated area.
　　
Xinhua News Agency, Taizhou, October 24th: In order to supply the needs for cotton seeds in the vast cotton fields next year and to improve the yield and quality of cotton, northern Jiangsu is now systematically promoting improved cotton seed work. There are more than ten kinds of cotton seeds distributed in the cotton-growing areas of northern Jiangsu. Due to years of cross-breeding and neglect of seed selection, the quality has mostly deteriorated due to hybridization. Next year, the cotton planting area will be expanded to 3.5 million mu, requiring approximately 245,000 dan of seed. Various cotton improvement stations and cotton companies are currently carrying out purchases, setting different prices based on variety and fiber length to encourage cotton farmers to select seeds. It is expected that after focused regional promotion next year, the quantity will increase year by year, and all cotton seeds can be improved in three to four years. Various places have already begun seed selection. The Yancheng Prefectural Commissioner's Office has issued a notice to Sheyang and two other counties to reserve more than 5 million jin of seeds. The Shehai District of Sheyang County also held a forum for cotton farmer representatives and cadres from various townships to conduct research and educate cotton farmers on seed selection methods. Graduates of the Shanghai Cotton Reclamation Training Class will also be assigned to various cotton promotion stations in northern Jiangsu to assist cotton farmers in seed selection.

　　苏北秋收结束　
    明年扩大棉田三百五十万亩
    【新华社上海二十四日电】苏北各地秋收基本上已告结束，平均收成六成至六成半。由于入夏以来各地迭遭风、雨、潮灾，约有一千七百万亩，占全部耕地三分之一的秋禾被淹，虽经党、政、军、民全力抢救，但失收或减收的秋禾仍达六、七百万亩。全区以海安、泰州、泰县、射阳、建阳、阜东（阜宁东部新设县）、江都、仪征、崇明等县及南通部分地区收成较好，一般可达八成。淮阴、南通专区灾情较重。沿海棉产平均每亩只收籽花三十斤到四十斤，射阳、阜东、如东（如皋东部新设县）、启东等灾轻地区一般可收七十斤到一百斤。由于秋收中中共各级党委有计划地组织重灾区农民到轻灾区或非灾区帮收，发动早秋户和晚秋户、旱田区和水田区先后进行等价交换劳动，对缺乏劳动力的烈、军、工属发动代工，包工，及时帮助鳏、寡、孤、独等困难户解决困难，督促回归的地主参加劳动等，收割的时间大大缩短。目前大部旱田地区已积极准备收割晚秋。东台、涟水、沐阳、睢宁、盐城、阜东、扬州等部分区乡积水地区，现正积极排水，争取于霜降前后种下麦籽，扩大耕地面积。
    【新华社泰州二十四日电】为供给明年广大棉田的棉种需要和提高棉花的产量质量，苏北地区现正有计划地推行改进棉种工作。分布苏北棉区内的棉种多达十余种，由于多年杂种和忽视选种，品质大部因杂交而日趋退化。明年植棉面积将扩大至三百五十万亩，约需籽种二十四万五千担。各棉花改良处和棉业公司刻正进行收购，以品种、纤维长度为标准，订出不同价格，鼓励棉农选种。预计明年有重点的分区集中推广后，逐年增加，三四年后可改良全部棉种。各地现已开始选种。盐城专署已通令射阳等三县，留籽种五百余万斤。射阳县射海区并召开各乡棉农代表和干部座谈会，进行研究及教育棉农选种方法。上海棉垦训练班毕业学员亦将分发至苏北各棉业推广所，协助棉农选种。
