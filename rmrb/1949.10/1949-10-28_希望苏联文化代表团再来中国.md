　　Hoping for Another Visit from the Soviet Cultural Delegation to China
　　Zhou Yang
　　The Soviet Cultural, Artistic, and Scientific Workers Delegation is about to return home. During their short stay in China, they have given us much enlightenment. Their profound friendship towards us, a friendship between brotherly nations permeated with the spirit of internationalism, is something we will never forget.
　　They personally told us about the great achievements and rich experiences of the Soviet Union's socialist cultural construction. This culture represents the highest peak that human culture has reached and illuminates the general direction of cultural development for all nations in the world. Molotov said that all roads lead to communism. Comrades Fadeyev and Simonov have also repeatedly reminded us that each nation's culture has its own path of development. We are learning from the Soviet Union on our own national foundation; without this learning, we cannot move forward. The arrival of the Soviet delegation in China is truly a blessing for all Chinese people and intellectuals! We hope they will come again! We hope that a second, a third, and countless more delegations will come continuously! They are our most respected good friends and mentors. They bring us knowledge, confidence, and courage. Their words and deeds are excellent examples of the combination of patriotism and internationalism!

　　希望苏联文化代表团再来中国
    周扬
    苏联文化艺术科学工作者代表团就要返国了，他们在短短的留华期间给予了我们很多的教益，他们对我们所表示的深厚友谊，一种贯串着国际主义精神的兄弟民族的友谊，是我们永远不能忘记的。
    他们亲自告诉了我们苏联社会主义文化建设的伟大成就和丰富经验，这种文化代表着人类文化所已达到的最高峰，照耀着世界各民族文化发展的总方向。莫洛托夫说过，条条道路通向共产主义。法捷耶夫、西蒙诺夫同志也一再提示我们，每个民族的文化都有它自己发展的道路。我们正是在自己民族的基础上向苏联学习，没有这种学习，我们是无法前进的。苏联代表团的来华，实在是全中国人民和知识界的一个福音！我们希望他们再来！希望第二个、第三个、以至无数个代表团源源而来！他们是我们最敬爱的益友和良师，他们带给我们知识、信心和勇气，他们的言行就是爱国主义与国际主义结合的良好榜样！
