The People Rule the World, with Guns as the Backing
    ——A Record of the Celebration Meeting of Meritorious Heroes of the 626th Regiment Celebrating the Birth of New China
    The second day after the good news of the opening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference spread throughout the army, I rushed to the 626th Regiment. In a room hanging with a huge map of China, the meritorious heroes of the entire regiment were enthusiastically holding a meeting to celebrate the birth of New China. They were truly overjoyed!
    Twenty-seven combat heroes, who had shed blood on the battlefield, some wounded several times. They knew that the birth of New China today was the result of yesterday's arduous battles. Squad Leader Meng Xianyi of the 6th Squad, 3rd Company, said: "In the past, we marched at night, couldn't eat when fighting, and fought desperately with the enemy, all to create a New China so that we could have a good life. Today, New China has really appeared, how can I not be happy!" Platoon Leader Yang Baoquan of the 2nd Platoon said: "After hearing this news, I ran through all the squads to tell every comrade about this major event that we have been waiting for for so many years." Squad Leader Xi Daoxue of the 9th Squad, 2nd Company, said: "With the People's Republic, I feel like I have a home!" Yuan En, the flag bearer of the regiment headquarters who had received three major merits, said: "New China is our victory fruit." Yes, they understand very well that the birth of New China today is a victory fruit exchanged for blood and sweat, and they understand even more how to defend this fruit. Everyone expressed that they would still use blood and sweat to defend it. Company Commander Liu Fengwu said: "In the past, to win the world, the guns came first. Today, to rule the world, the guns are the backing." He then said loudly: "No matter which reactionary dares to move, whether openly, secretly, domestically, or abroad, we will eliminate them!"
    In the heated meeting, Political Commissar Peng announced three times that everyone should take a break before continuing, but it never stopped. They were as responsible and serious as if they were discussing their own combat merit plans. Platoon Leader Yan Qinglin of the 3rd Platoon, 8th Company, said: "Intensifying military training and striving for regularization is the practical action to defend New China." Gao Tiancai, Deputy Squad Leader of the 6th Company, pointed to the map and said: "Now the Chiang bandits have not been completely eliminated, and Taiwan and Tibet are still waiting for us to liberate. If the Central People's Government orders us to attack Sichuan or Taiwan, we will set off immediately." Meng Xianyi said: "The weapons have been polished! The bayonets have been sharpened! I will always work in the army! I will not allow any reactionaries to invade the People's Republic."
    During the meeting, everyone was most concerned about whether anyone would be frightened by American imperialism. They said proudly: "We have the experience of fighting Japan, let alone the outwardly strong but inwardly weak America. We will never let him be mischievous." The meeting lasted for four hours. Finally, everyone said: We want to tell all the representatives of the CPPCC that we used to wipe our guns every week when we were fighting, and we still wipe our guns every week now. We are moving towards regularization, awaiting the call of the Central People's Government. If any reactionaries dare to be mischievous, order us to eliminate them. Everyone also hoped that the industrial country would be established quickly so that we could equip our national defense army with the most sophisticated combat weapons.

　　人民坐天下，枪杆作后盾
    ——记六二六团大功功臣庆祝新中国诞生座谈会
    中国人民政协会开幕的喜讯传遍部队的第二天，我赶到六二六团哪里，在一个悬着巨幅中国大地图的房内，全团大功功臣热烈的开着庆祝新中国诞生的座谈会。他们真是太高兴呵！
    二十七位战斗英雄，在战场流过血，有的负伤几次。他们知道今天新中国的诞生是昨天艰苦战斗的结果。三连六班长孟宪仪说：“过去夜行军，打起仗吃不上饭，和敌人拚命，都为打出个新中国来，才有好日子，今天新中国真的出现了，叫我怎能不高兴啊！”二排长杨宝全说：“听到这消息之后我跑遍了各班，把这盼了多少年的大事，告诉每一个同志。”二连九班长习道学说：“有了人民共和国，我觉着是有了家啦！”立过三个大功的团部旗员袁恩说：“新中国就是咱们的胜利果实”。是的，他们很明白今天新中国的诞生是血和汗换来的胜利果实，更明白怎样去保卫这个果实，全体都表示仍要用血和汗保卫他。连长刘凤五说：“过去打天下，枪杆先出头，今天坐天下，枪杆就是后盾。”他接着大声说：“不管公开、暗藏、国内、国外哪一个反动派敢动一动，我们就把它消灭掉！”
    在热烈的会议中，彭政委宣布三次要大家歇会儿再开，但终未停止下来。他们象在讨论自己战斗立功计划那样负责、认真。八连三排长阎庆林说：“现在加紧炼兵，努力走向正规化，就是保卫新中国的实际行动。”六连副班长高天才指着地图说：“现在蒋匪还没消灭完，台湾、西藏，还等我们去解放。中央人民政府下命令叫我们打四川，打台湾，我们马上就动身。”孟宪仪说：“武器早擦亮啦！刺刀磨光啦！我永远就在军队上干啦！不叫任何反动派来侵犯人民共和国。”
    会议上大家最关怀的就是是否有人会被美国帝国主义吓倒。他们骄傲地说：“我们有打日本的经验，何况外强中干的美国，绝不让他调皮。”会一直开了四小时之久。最后大家说：我们要告诉政协全体代表，我们过去战斗时每礼拜擦枪，现在仍是每礼拜擦枪。我们正走向正规化，听候着中央人民政府的调用，任何反动派敢调皮，就命令我们去消灭他。大家还希望把工业国很快建立起来，给我们国防军装备最精锐的战斗武器。
