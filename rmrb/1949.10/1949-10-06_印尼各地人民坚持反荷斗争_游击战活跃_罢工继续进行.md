Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 4th – TASS reports citing a Dutch news agency from Yogyakarta that the Indonesian people’s anti-Dutch struggle continues in various regions. Residents of Solo are demanding the withdrawal of Dutch troops from the city. The general strike in South Borneo continues and is tending to expand. The situation in East Borneo is unstable, with major strikes brewing in enterprises such as the "Royal Interocean Lines" and the "Royal Dutch Shell Oil Company" in Samarinda. At the same time, guerrilla warfare is also continuing in South Borneo.

Under these circumstances, the Dutch ship "Mariner", carrying more than 1,600 officers and soldiers, has sailed to Indonesia to continue reinforcing Dutch troops in Java and intensify the suppression of the Javanese people's resistance movement.

However, according to a letter from Java published in the Dutch Communist Party's "Truth" newspaper, guerrilla warfare is active throughout the island. The conspiracies of Dutch and American imperialism will never be able to destroy the Indonesian people’s will to achieve complete victory. The people are giving the guerrillas their full support.

　　印尼各地人民坚持反荷斗争
    游击战活跃·罢工继续进行
    【新华社北京四日电】据塔斯社电引荷兰通讯社日惹消息，印尼各地人民的反荷斗争仍坚持中。梭罗居民要求荷军自该城撤退。南婆罗洲的大罢工仍继续进行，并有扩大趋势。东婆罗洲形势不稳，三马林达的“皇家轮船公司”、“皇家壳够牌石油公司”等企业正酝酿大罢工。同时南婆罗洲的游击战争也在继续中。
    在此情况下，荷轮“水手”号载官兵一千六百余人开赴印尼，继续增援爪哇荷军，加强镇压爪哇人民的抗荷运动。
    但据荷共“真理”报发表爪哇来函说：全岛各地游击战活跃。荷美帝国主义的阴谋绝不能摧毁印尼人民取得完全胜利的意志人民给予游击队以全力支援。
