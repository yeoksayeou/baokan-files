　　Beijing Municipality's Immigrants to Chahar North
  　First Two Batches Have Set Off
    [Beijing News] With winter approaching, the Beijing Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau, in order to ensure that immigrants to Chahar North arrive in the rural areas of Chahar North before the freeze, to facilitate resettlement, has been actively carrying out work such as registration, organization, transportation, and resettlement in conjunction with the Chahar Provincial Government. The first batch of 179 immigrants departed for Chahar on the 19th, and the second batch of 251 also left Beijing by night train on the 21st. Before their departure, cadres from various districts held symposiums and conducted individual interviews to introduce the situation in Chahar North in detail, strengthening the immigrants' determination to settle and establish a career in Chahar North. A few immigrant households who had ideological concerns, after confirming that the information introduced by the government was consistent with the facts from their friends' conversations and letters, said gratefully: "The government's approach is very good, they are very thoughtful." Some said: "This is a good opportunity, the sooner we go the better, the sooner we go the sooner we will prosper." The number of immigrant households registering in various districts is still increasing daily and will be received by the Chahar Provincial Government in batches before mid-November to settle and establish careers in Chahar North and engage in agricultural production.

　　京市赴察北移民
  　头两批已启程
    【北京讯】冬季将至，本市民政局为使察北移民于冰冻以前到达察北农村，以便安置，特会同察哈尔省政府积极进行登记、组织、输送与安置等工作。第一批移民一七九人已于十九日赴察，第二批二五一人亦于二十一日夜车离京。行前各区干部以召开座谈会与进行个别谈话等方式，详细介绍了察北情况，加强了移民户到察北安家立业的决心。少数思想上有顾虑的移民户，从朋友的谈话与信件中证实政府所介绍的情况与事实相符后感激地说：“政府的办法很好，给人们想的很周到。”有的说：“这是好机会，早去早好，早去早发家。”现在前往各区登记的移民户数每日仍不断增加，将于十一月中旬以前由察哈尔省政府分批接往察北安家立业，从事农业生产。（市府新闻处）
