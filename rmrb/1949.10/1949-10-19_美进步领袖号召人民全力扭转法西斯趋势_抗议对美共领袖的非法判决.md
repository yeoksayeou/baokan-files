Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 18th: TASS, New York, October 16th: The "Worker Daily" of the United States published a special issue on the verdict of the New York Federal Court jury against the leaders of the American Communist Party. Congressman Marcantonio, leader of the American Labor Party, stated in his statement: "This verdict is a sharp challenge to the freedom of every American. It attempts to falsely accuse the American people's basic rights of political opinion, assembly, and association as crimes. It conforms to the traditional format of the rise of fascism – that is, first declaring the Communist Party illegal, and then inevitably proceeding to destroy all minority parties, trade unions, and progressive groups."

Judge Harris of Indiana, chairman of the recently formed "National Non-Partisan Committee for the Protection of the Rights of the Twelve Communist Party Leaders," stated in his statement that the entire "trial" violated the defendants' constitutionally guaranteed rights. "In a place where the jury was selected with prejudice, the judge was biased, the prosecutor was hostile, and informants acted as witnesses, it would be a miracle if the defendants were not 'convicted'."

Robertson, the Washington correspondent of the Workers Daily, reported: The famous democratic fighter Robertson announced that the outcome of the Communist Party "trial" made the 14th "a day of a thousand Peekskill incidents. This verdict clearly proves that large-scale fascist actions endanger every American. There is no time to waste. Efforts must be doubled to fight. Every American must unite with the Communist Party to rescue them from prison, overturn this verdict, and impeach Medina… This is a turning point in American history. The American people must reverse the fascist trend."

Three staff members of the Bakery Workers Union of the American Federation of Labor, Duto, Tedman, and Candell, declared: "We condemn this appalling and brazen lynching. We support future appeals."

Fischer, chairman of the United Cafeteria Workers Union, stated: This verdict endangers every trade unionist, but every trade unionist "must ensure that this serious injustice is corrected and that Medina and Truman are convicted of violating the Constitution and the rights of the people."

Many other trade union leaders similarly condemned the verdict, including Gold, chairman of the Fur Workers Union. He called on all workers, regardless of political affiliation, to support a "movement to help change and overturn this Hitler-style verdict." This verdict is an approval of the action of persecuting progressive leaders.

Linfield, an executive of the American Progressive Youth Association, stated: "American youth will never willingly accept this verdict or this police state."

　　美进步领袖号召人民全力扭转法西斯趋势
  　抗议对美共领袖的非法判决
    【新华社北京十八日电】塔斯社纽约十六日讯：美国“工人日报”为纽约联邦法院陪审团对美国共产党领袖们的判决，刊行专刊。美国劳工党领袖众议员马肯托尼奥在他的声明中称：“这个判决对每一个美国人的自由，是一个尖锐的挑战。它企图把美国人民的政治意见及集会结社自由的基本权利诬为犯罪。它符合法西斯主义崛起的传统格式——这就是：首先宣布共产党为非法，继则不可避免地进而摧毁一切的少数党、职工会及进步团体。”
    最近组成的“维护共产党领袖十二人权利的全国无党派委员会”主席、印第安纳州法官哈里斯在他的声明中称：全部的“审讯”破坏了被告的宪法上所规定的权利。“在陪审团是被拣选出来的、心怀偏见，法官怀有私见，检察官怀有仇视，及告密者充当证人的地方，如果被告们竟不被‘判罪’，那才是一种奇迹呢。”
    工人日报驻华盛顿记者罗布逊报道：著名民主战士罗伯逊宣布，共产党“审讯”的结局，使十四日成为“一千个毕克斯吉尔事件的日子。这个判决明确地证明：大规模的法西斯行动危及每一个美国人，时间不能空度了，必须加倍努力进行斗争。每一个美国人必须与共产党联合起来，从监狱中营救他们，取消这个判决，并弹劾麦迪纳……。这是美国历史的转折点，美国人民必须扭转法西斯趋势。”
    美国劳联的面包工人工会的三位职员：杜托、泰德曼及坎德尔宣称：“我们指责这个惊人的无耻的私刑。我们支持将来提出的上诉。”
    联合咖啡馆工人工会主席费歇尔称：这个判决使每一个职工会运动者陷入危境，但是，每一个职工会运动者“务须使这个严重的不公的裁判得到纠正，并判定麦迪纳及杜鲁门犯了违反宪法和人民权利的罪行。”
    许多其他的职工会领袖们，同样地指责了这个判决，其中包括毛皮工人工会主席高尔德。他号召所有工人，不分政治党派，支持一个“协助改变与取消这个希特勒式判决的运动”。这个判决乃是对于大肆迫害进步领袖们之行动的批准。
    美国进步青年协会干事林费德声称：“美国青年对于这个判决或这个警察国家，绝不甘心接受。”
