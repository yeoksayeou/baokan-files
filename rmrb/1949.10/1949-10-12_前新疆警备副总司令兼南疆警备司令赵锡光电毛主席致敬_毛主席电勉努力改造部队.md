Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 11th: Former Xinjiang Garrison Deputy Commander and South Xinjiang Garrison Commander Zhao Xiguang sent a respectful telegram to Chairman Mao on the 1st. The telegram stated: "To Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central People's Government: Since the Chinese People's Liberation Army victoriously completed the people's liberation cause, and under your leadership, convened the People's Political Consultative Conference to establish a unified, independent, democratic, and free New Democratic Republic of China, the people of the whole country are overjoyed at the birth of the new China. Under the leadership of Mr. Zhang Zhizhong, Xinjiang has laid the foundation for peaceful, democratic, unified, and united nationalities. However, due to the obstruction of a small number of stubborn reactionaries, the ideal task could not be achieved earlier. Now, with the support of the military and civilians of the entire province of Xinjiang and the encouragement of the great friendly country, the Soviet Union, Xinjiang has severed relations with the Guangzhou Kuomintang government since September 25th and sincerely accepts your leadership. From now on, Xinjiang has embarked on a bright and splendid path of peaceful construction. On behalf of the three million soldiers and civilians in southern Xinjiang, I would like to extend the most sincere and lofty national liberation salute to you and all comrades of the great People's Liberation Army.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Zhao Xiguang, Deputy Commander of the Xinjiang Garrison and Commander of the South Xinjiang Garrison

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 11th: Chairman Mao replied to former Xinjiang Garrison Deputy Commander and South Xinjiang Garrison Commander Zhao Xiguang today, saying: "General Zhao Xiguang: Your telegram of the 1st has been received. The peaceful liberation of Xinjiang is gratifying to the whole country. It is hoped that all officers and soldiers of the troops stationed in southern Xinjiang will unite and work hard to transform themselves into a people's army.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Mao Zedong, October 10th"

    毛主席电勉努力改造部队
    【新华社北京十一日电】前新疆警备副总司令兼南疆警备司令赵锡光于一日电毛主席致敬。电称：中央人民政府主席毛泽东先生：自中国人民解放军胜利的完成人民解放事业，并在先生领导下，召开人民政治协商会议，建立统一独立民主自由的新民主主义的中华人民共和国，全国人民都为新中国的诞生而欢欣鼓舞。新疆在张治中先生领导下，已奠定了各民族和平民主统一团结的基础。不过因有少数顽固反动派的阻挠，不能早日达到理想的任务。现在新疆在全省军民的拥护及伟大友邦苏联的鼓励下，已于九月二十五日起，和广州国民党政府断绝关系，竭诚接受先生的领导。从此新疆走上了光明灿烂和平建设的大道。本人代表南疆三百万军民，谨向先生及伟大的人民解放军全体同志致最诚恳崇高的民族解放敬礼。
