　　Carnival Diary
　　October 2nd in the Streets of the Capital
　　[Special Report from This Newspaper] Carnival Day – October 2nd, the second day of the formal establishment of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, the crowds in the streets of Beijing surpassed any other festival. From morning till night, the sounds of gongs and drums, cheers, singing, and speeches continued without end. Workers, students, soldiers, and other men, women, old and young citizens, all released from factories, government offices, organizations, and schools, gathered in the streets all day long, enthusiastically celebrating the establishment of their own Central People's Government. In the bustling urban areas of Dongdan, Xidan, Dongsi, Xisi, East and West Chang'an Avenue, Tiananmen Square, and Qianmenwai, the surroundings were filled with dense crowds of people, except for the center of the roads reserved for parades and propaganda teams. Many elderly people simply sat or squatted in places where they wouldn't obstruct others, because they were unwilling to miss any exciting scenes, unwilling to easily let go of such a significant day, always wanting to see and hear more on this day. Colorful floats, adorned with many red flags, pulled red circles, tied with green cypress branches, and decorated with large red stars, large slogans, and giant portraits of Chairman Mao, slowly passed through the dense crowds from time to time. The trade union system alone dispatched forty to fifty floats. The young men and women in the floats sang the national anthem or other songs, played military music, and shouted slogans in a loud and measured tone through喇叭式扩音器: "Support the Common Program," "Support the Central People's Government," "Support the People's Democratic Dictatorship," "Carry the revolution through to the end"…….
　　Slowly, teams of Yangge dancers came twisting or jumping over, and people immediately focused their attention on them, seeing each of the young people jumping back and forth with such vitality, and everyone responded with warm applause. When a young team member in Xisanmen told the audience, "The People's Liberation Army has already reached Guangdong in the south, and Xinjiang has been liberated in the west, and the day of the complete liberation of the whole of China is just around the corner," everyone applauded and cheered enthusiastically. Dozens of members of the propaganda team of the Guard Brigade of the Public Security Department of the North China People's Government, with guns hanging in one hand and red sickles in the other, vigorously sang and danced in the streets, and a crowd of spectators closely surrounded them. At Xisi Archway, a certain division's training brigade guarding the capital, centered on supporting the Central People's Government and eliminating counter-revolutionary forces, compiled several Yangge dances, which were greatly welcomed by the audience. Many ordinary people brought boiled water to慰劳 them. More than four hundred students from the Municipal Third Middle School came from Huguosi to Pinganli, each raising their voices to give speeches to the ordinary people. Hui Muslim students from Yanshan Middle School, a private school in Huangsi, also rushed into the city to participate in the citywide Hui Muslim celebration.
　　The propaganda teams became more and more numerous, one team coming out of this street and another team coming out of that street. Red flags slowly fluttered forward in the middle of the streets, merging with the national flags on both sides to form a giant red torrent. The sounds of slogans, singing, gongs and drums, and people's cheers made every street boil.
　　In front of Tiananmen Square, more than eight hundred Yangge and flower drum teams and many floats gathered, red flags like clouds, flying all over the field, surrounded by more than 20,000 spectators. The Yangge procession of the Third Division of North China University and the China Youth Art Theater took the lead from the east and west roads. Thirty to forty red flags, each more than ten feet long, fluttered in the wind, and red drums with diameters of more than three feet and three to four hundred waist drums beat out the sounds of battle. Hundreds of young men and women danced vigorous Yangge dances. When the "Victory Flower Drum" of the People's Art Troupe appeared in front of people, thunderous applause erupted from the crowd. From both sides of the giant portrait of Chairman Mao, the waist drum team of the Third Literary and Art Troupe of North China University涌出, "Hey! Hey! Hey!" shook the heavens and the earth. When they jumped around four red flags, the new China's national anthem was played on the rostrum. In the singing of "Ten thousand years of hope realized today" and "The people united as one," they immediately merged together, and large red silks connected into "Long Live the People's Republic of China,"彩花缤纷, ten thousand people laughed. The China Youth Art Theater's "Red Flag Flying, Victorious Advance" was performed by twenty young soldiers holding red flags, the People's Liberation Army advancing forward, fighting with the enemy, climbing mountains and crossing bridges, sweeping and pursuing, or lying down, or bowing their heads, or leaping forward, killing and charging, and wiping out the enemy cleanly. The Yangge dance of the Third Division of North China University appeared in the center of twenty-three red flags, sometimes forming "People," "Republic," and sometimes showing "Long Live," "Red Star." Workers, peasants, and soldiers, all "advancing under the banner of Mao Zedong."
　　At night, fireworks were set off in Beihai Park, and遊艺晚会 in Zhongshan Park and other places also began.
　　The Beihai Park fireworks gala was held at 7 o'clock. Twelve different kinds of fireworks successively sprayed out brilliant sparks on the海中平台上. Every time a cluster of sparks rose into the sky, the masses responded with warm applause and cheers. What could make the masses most jubilant and excited was the large characters of "Long Live the People's Republic of China" and "Long Live the Central People's Government," etc., that fell from the花盒 one after another, especially when the five characters "Long Live Chairman Mao" appeared, tens of thousands of people shouted the same slogan loudly. Finally, a long piece of cloth fell in the flames, and under the national flag and the portrait of Chairman Mao on the cloth were written twelve large characters: "Support World Peace, Oppose Aggression and War," which represented the power of the new China and the direction of the Chinese people.

　　狂欢日记
    十月二日的首都街头
    【本报特写】狂欢日——十月二日，中华人民共和国中央人民政府正式成立的第二日，北京全市街头的拥挤超过任何其他节日。从早晨到夜晚，锣鼓声、欢呼声、歌唱声与讲演声竟日不断。所有工厂机关团体学校放假出来的工人学生士兵与其他男女老幼市民，都竟日云集在街头，热烈地庆祝自己的中央人民政府的成立。在东单、西单、东四、西四、东西长安街、天安门、前门外等热闹市区，除大路中心留给游行与宣传队伍的行进外，四周全是黑压压的人群。有许多老者干脆在不妨碍别人的地方坐起来或蹲起来看，因为他们不愿意放弃任何精彩的场面，不愿意轻易放过这样一个意义重大的日子，总想在这一天看得更多些，听得更多些。插了许多红旗，扯着许多红园，扎了绿色柏枝，装着大红星、大标语与毛主席巨像的彩车，不时从黑压压的人群中徐徐穿过。仅工会系统出动的彩车即有四五十辆。彩车里的男女青年们有的在唱着国歌或其他歌曲，有的在吹奏着军乐，有的在用喇叭式扩音器一字一板的喊：“拥护共同纲领”，“拥护中央人民政府”，“拥护人民民主专政”，“将革命进行到底”……。
    慢慢地，一队一队的秧歌扭着或跳着过来了，人们便立刻把目光投射在他们的身上，看见一个个的青年人都那样生气勃勃地来回的跳动，大家便报以热烈的掌声。一位青年的队员在西安门向听众讲到：“人民解放军在南边已经打到了广东，在西边已解放了新疆，全中国全部解放的日子就在眼前”的时候，大家便热烈的鼓掌和欢呼。华北人民政府公安部警卫大队的宣传队的几十个队员，一手挂着枪，一手拿着红色的镰刀在大街上有力地歌舞着，一群观众紧紧地包围着他们。在西四牌楼有警卫京都的某师教导大队，以拥护中央人民政府和肃清反革命势力为中心，编了几个秧歌舞，大大的受到观众的欢迎。许多老百姓提了开水来慰劳他们。市立第三中学的四百多学生从护国寺来到平安里，一个个提高了嗓子向着老百姓讲演。黄寺私立燕山中学的回民学生，也赶进城来参加全市回民的庆祝会。
    宣传的队伍愈来愈多了，从这一条街出来一队，从那一条街又出来一队。红旗在街道的中间徐徐地飘动着前进。和两旁的国旗在一起汇合成了一股红色的巨流。口号声、歌唱声、锣鼓声和人们的欢呼声，每一条街道都沸腾了。
    在天安门前，有八百多个秧歌花鼓队和许多彩车汇集起来，红旗如云，满场翻飞，四周围拢了两万多观众。华北大学第三部和中国青年艺术剧院的秧歌行列从东西两路带头前进，三四十幅一丈多长的红旗迎风飘展，三尺多直径的红鼓和三四百个腰鼓敲起了战斗的声音，几百个青年男女跳起了矫健的秧歌舞。人民文艺工作团的“胜利花鼓”出现在人们面前的时候，人群中爆发出雷鸣般的掌声。从毛主席巨像的两侧，涌出了华大第三文工团的腰鼓队，“嘿！嘿！嘿！”震动天地，当他们围绕着四幅红旗跳跃时，主席台奏起了新中国的国歌，在“万年希望实现在今天”“人民团结一条心”的歌声中，他们又立即汇在一起，大红绸缎连成了“中华人民共和国万岁”，彩花缤纷，万人欢笑。中国青年艺术剧院的“红旗飘扬胜利进军”，由二十个青年战士手擎着红旗，人民解放军向前，和敌人搏斗，翻山过桥，扫荡追击，或卧倒，或俯首，或跃进，杀呀冲呀，消灭敌人干净。华大第三部的秧歌舞，在二十三面红旗中央出现，他们时而摆成“人民”，“共和国”，时而现出“万岁”，“红星”。工人、农民、战士、一齐“在毛泽东旗帜下前进”。
    夜间，北海公园的焰火升了起来，中山公园等处的游艺晚会也开始了。
    北海公园焰火晚会，在七时举行。十二种不同的焰火，先后在海中平台上喷射出灿烂的火花。每当一簇火花腾向天空时，群众都报以热烈的掌声和欢呼声。最能使群众欢腾和兴奋的，是花盒里先后落下的“中华人民共和国万岁”，“中央人民政府万岁”等火焰熊熊的大字，尤其是当“毛主席万岁”五个字显现时，千万群众大声的喊出了同样的口号。最后，一片长布在火焰中落下来，布上的国旗，毛主席像的下面写着：“拥护世界和平，反对侵略战争”十二个大字，它表示着新中国的力量，和中国人民的方向。
