　　The Great Plan of the Soviet Union to Change Nature
    In October 1948, upon the suggestion of Stalin, the Soviet government and the Central Committee of the Communist Party adopted a plan to enable the grassland and forest-grassland areas of the European part of the Soviet Union to obtain abundant and stable harvests. This plan designed the planting of protective forest belts, the implementation of pasture rotation, and the construction of artificial lakes, ponds, and reservoirs.
    This huge undertaking, which will take more than fifteen years to complete, will be of great value in promoting socialist agriculture. The droughts that occur from time to time in the grassland and forest-grassland areas of the European part of the Soviet Union have caused terrible disasters to the country's agriculture. In the past sixty-five years, the Volga region has experienced more than twenty droughts, the Voronezh and Rostov regions have experienced fifteen, and the Kursk, Kaluga, and other regions have experienced more than ten. Low and extremely unstable harvests were indeed a terrible scourge for grassland agriculture in the past.
    Now science has proven a principle, and the implementation of collective farms, state farms, and machine and tractor stations has also confirmed this principle: that with appropriate agricultural systems, it is entirely possible for arid areas to obtain large and stable harvests and to establish a strong supply base for agricultural development.
    The scale of the planned project is indeed enormous. One figure is enough to illustrate this fact. In fifteen years, more than six million hectares of land (sixty thousand square kilometers) will be prepared for afforestation.
    The planting of national protective forest belts is unprecedented in scale. Their total length will exceed 5,300 kilometers. In addition to their moisture-retaining effect, their arrangement will act as a powerful barrier against the hot and dry southeasterly winds, which often damage the harvests of the Volga, North Caucasus, and Don grassland areas. Perennial trees, especially oak, will be planted in large quantities within these protective forest belts. Trees will be planted in large numbers around collective farms and state farms for wind protection, to supplement the national protective forest belts.
    The effect of protective forest belts and windbreaks on harvests can be expressed in scientific figures. Compared with unprotected areas, the average increase in yield in protected areas is as follows: grains – 25 to 30 percent, vegetables – 50 to 75 percent, forage – 100 to 200 percent.
    The offensive against drought has been launched by the Soviet people. This offensive includes the systematic adoption of a series of programs that make up the well-known Tulayev agricultural system, which was painstakingly drafted by renowned Soviet scientists Dokuchaev, Kostychev, and Williams. This agricultural system contains a complex set of programs: such as planting trees in river basins, riverbanks, lake shores, pond banks, reservoir banks, valley slopes, and shifting sand areas, and planting windbreak dikes to protect reclaimed areas; such as rational management and reclamation of soil, which is particularly effective when applied to ordinary fallow land and winter fallow land; and such as the scientific use of organic and mineral fertilizers, so that selection and high-yielding varieties can be adapted to local conditions; such as water conservancy programs, utilizing the construction of ponds and reservoirs to eliminate waterlogging.
    The great work of changing nature was begun by the Soviet Union many years ago. During the First Stalin Five-Year Plan, the Soviet people greatly changed the geography of their country. New and broad waterways appeared – the Moscow Canal, the White Sea-Baltic Canal, and the Stalin Fergana Canal in Central Asia. Tens of thousands of hectares of swamps were drained and cultivated. The planting of grains and fruit trees began to advance northwards and eastwards. For example, wheat crossed from the 56th parallel to beyond the 60th parallel, and orchards spread from Central Russia to the Urals, Siberia, Sakhalin, Kazakhstan, and elsewhere. Before the war, 30,000,000 hectares of barren and depleted land had already been developed and reclaimed.
    Far-reaching programs proceeding along these lines are all contained in the post-war Five-Year Plan for the revival and development of the Soviet economy. The land reclamation program alone prepares to reclaim 1,300,000 hectares of land in five years. This land is mainly the deserts and wastelands of the Central Asian republics, the vast swamps of Belarus, and the Baraba Steppe of Siberia. In order to ensure reliable harvests, water conservancy is being carried out on a large scale in the arid areas of the Central Russian Uplands, the Volga, the North Caucasus, and the Crimea.
    The publication of the resolutions of the Soviet Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the Communist Party has been warmly embraced by collective farm peasants. They have a deep understanding of the political importance of the resolutions, and they are determined to cooperate with the resolutions through their labor.
    This sentiment is fully expressed in the countless letters to Stalin from collective farms, machine and tractor stations, state farms, and forest conservation workers. The farmers of the Tambov region wrote in a collective letter: "This wise resolution has given us boundless joy and pride. It has opened a broad path for peasants to abundance, happiness, and prosperity."
    The Soviet people, with the help of the government, have launched a decisive attack on drought, which is a war to obtain large and stable harvests.
    Last year, collective farms, state farms, and forest management offices (most of which belong to the grassland area, and some of which belong to the forest-grassland area of the European part of the Soviet Union) planted protective forest belts and windbreaks in a cumulative area of 1,989,000 hectares.
    Within the first two months after the publication of this historic resolution, preparations were made to plant trees on 270,000 hectares in 1949. In order to plant trees and care for tree seedlings, collective farms organized more than 20,000 work teams. State farms, collective farms, and state farm nurseries prepared 1,868,500,000 seedlings. New nurseries have been set up in vast areas. 7,825 tons of seeds of fruit trees, industrial trees, shrubs, and other colored trees have been collected. Among these seeds are 6,225 tons of acorns, because oak trees are most valuable for grassland afforestation.
    The movement to adopt scientific harvest rotation is gathering increasing strength; 60,553 collective farms have planned their rotation sites or have completed plans for adopting pasture rotation.
    Last year, collective farms in the grassland or forest-grassland areas built 2,812 ponds and reservoirs using on-site natural drainage methods. Another 4,300 are planned to be built this year.
    A scientific expedition and groups of many experts are planning future national protective forest belts. Along these forest belts, fifty forest management offices and two hundred forest protection stations are being set up to supplement the original ones. Thousands of forestry experts have been ordered to county central areas, collective farms, and state farms.
    Led by the Communist Party and their government, the Soviet people are victoriously solving the task of establishing a stable and highly agricultural production system that ensures that drought will no longer come.
    Until now, no country in the world has attempted such a large-scale plan to change nature. Clearly, only the socialist system can give full scope to the development of national productive forces.

　　苏联改变自然的伟大计划
    一九四八年十月，由于斯大林的建议，苏维埃政府与共产党中央委员会，采取了一个计划，使苏联欧洲部分的草原与森林草原区，能获得丰富而稳定的收获。这个计划设计了防护林带的种植，牧场循环的实施，与人工湖、塘和蓄水池的建筑。
    这个需要十五年多去完成的巨大工作，在促进社会主义农业上，将有着很大的价值。苏联欧洲部分的草原与森林草原区不时发生的旱灾，对国家的农业曾产生过可怕的灾害。过去六十五年中，伏尔加区有过二十次以上的旱灾，浮罗列兹与罗斯托夫区域有过十五次，可斯基、卡多夫与其他区域，也有过十次以上。低额而极度不稳定的收获，对于草原农业，从前确是个可怕的祸患。
    现在科学业已证明了一个原则，同时，集体农场、国家农场、机器与拖拉机站的实施，也证实了这个原则，这就是：有了适当的农业制度，干燥区域得到大量而稳定的收获，为农业的发展而建立坚强的给养基地，都是很可能的。
    计划中的工程，规模确是巨大。一个数字足够说明这个事实。十五年中，有六百万海克塔以上的土地（六万平方公里）准备植林。
    种植国家防护林带，规模之大是史无前例。它们的总长将超过五、三○○公里。除保留湿气的效能外，它们将此种布置以对付热而干燥的东南风，这是个强有力的阻碍物，这种风对于伏尔加、北可卡沙斯和邓等草原地带的收获，时常在损害着。能多年生的树株，尤其是橡树，将大量种植于这些防护林带内。集体农场与国家农场的周围，将大量种植树株，以作防风之用，以补国家防护林带之不足。
    防护林带与防风林对于收获的效果，可用科学数字表示。用这种方法保护的区域与未保护区比较，产量平均增加额如下：谷类——百分之二十五到三十，蔬菜类——百分之五十到七十五，刍粮类——百分之一百到二百。
    对旱灾的攻势已被苏维埃人民进行。这攻势包括一批方案的系统采用，这些方案组成人所共知的吐拉发泼利农业体制，这些体制是苏联名科学家它科沙也夫、科斯梯写夫与威廉所辛勤拟就的。这个农业体制包含一套复杂的方案：如植树于河道流域、河岸、湖岸、塘岸、蓄水池岸、山谷斜坡、流沙区域，植阻风堤保护开垦区域；如合理管理与开垦土壤方案，这方案施于普通休作地与冬季休作地尤为有效；又如科学的使用有机物与矿物肥料，使选种与高度产量的变种能适合当地情况；如水利方案，利用塘与蓄水池的建筑以排除积水。
    改变自然的巨大工作，许多年前苏联即已开始。第一次斯大林五年计划期中，苏维埃人民即已大大改变了他们国家的地理。新而广阔的水道出现了——莫斯科运河、白海波罗的海运河与中亚的斯大林否加那大运河。成万海克塔的沼泽被排水而耕种了。谷物与果树的种植开始向北向东推进。例如，麦子从第五十六条纬线越过第六十条纬线，果园从中俄罗斯到乌拉、西伯里亚、沙哈林、卡沙卡和拉卡等地。在战前，即有三○、○○○、○○○海克塔不毛之地与地利已竭地区今已被开拓而垦殖了。
    沿着这些线索前进的远大方案，皆包含于复兴与发展苏维埃经济的战后五年计划之中。仅开拓方案一项，就准备在五年中开垦一、三○○、○○○海克塔土地。这些土地主要的是中亚共和国的沙漠和荒地，必也罗那西亚的广大沼泽，和西伯里亚的吧那宾斯基草原。为了保证有可靠的收获，中俄罗斯高原、伏尔加、北可卡沙斯和克里米亚的干燥区，水利在大规模修筑着。
    苏联部长会议与共产党中央委员会决议案的发表，得到集体农场农民们的热烈拥护。他们对决议案的政治重要性是有深刻了解的，他们决心以劳动去配合这个决议案。
    从集体农场、机械与拖拉机站、国家农场和森林保养工人们，给斯大林的不可胜数的信中，这种情绪充分表现了出来。塔姆播夫区的农人们在一封集体信中这样写道：“这个聪明的决议案，给予了我们无限的快乐与骄傲。它为农民向丰富、快乐与繁荣打开了一条宽广的道路。”
    苏维埃人民，得到政府的帮助，已经对旱灾展开了决定性的攻击，这是为了得到大量而稳定收获进行的一个战争。
    在去年，集体农场、国家农场与森林管理处（它们大部属于草原区，也有属于苏联欧洲部分的森林草原区。）在一个一九八、九○○海克塔的积聚区域中，种植了防护林带与防风林堤。
    这个有历史意义的决议案发表后的头两个月内，就预备在一九四九年内植树二七○、○○○海克塔。为了植树与照料树株，集体农场曾组织了二○、○○○多个工作队。国家农场、集体农场、与国家农场苗圃，曾预备了一、八六八、五○○、○○○棵幼苗。新苗圃已经设置于广大区域之中。果树、工业用树、灌木及他色树株的种子，已经收集了七、八二五吨。这批种子中有六、二二五吨橡实，因为橡树对草原植林最有价值。
    为采用科学的收获循环而展开的运动，正在有增无已的聚集力量；六○·五五三个集体农场已经计划好他们的循环场地，或已完成采用牧场循环的计划。
    草原或森林草原区的集体农场，去年以就地自然排水法，建筑了二、八一二个塘与蓄水池。其他尚有四千三百个，计划在今年建筑。
    一个科学远征队与许多专家们的团体，正在计划着未来的国家防护林带。沿着这些林带，有五十个森林管理处，和两百个森林保护站正在设置着，以补原有的不足。几千个森林专家已经命令去县中心区、集体农场与国家农场。
    被共产党和他们的政府领导着，苏维埃人民胜利地解决了这个工作，即建立稳定而高度农业生产的体制，这个体制保证旱灾不再来临。
    直到现在，世界上还没有一个国家尝试过这样大规模改变自然的计划。显然的，仅仅有社会主义制度能为国家生产力的发展，给予充分的活动范围。
