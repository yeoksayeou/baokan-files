Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 6th: The second day of the National Xinhua Bookstore Publishing Work Conference was the 4th. In the morning, Lu Dingyi, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee, delivered a political report. In the afternoon, Hu Yuzhi gave a report on the overview of the national publishing industry. When Minister Lu discussed the international situation, he emphasized that the balance of power between the two major camps in the world after World War II—the world anti-imperialist democratic camp and the world imperialist reactionary camp—had undergone tremendous changes. He said: The world's people's democratic forces, led by the Soviet Union, are entirely capable of preventing the outbreak of a third world war. The victory of the Chinese revolution is the third great victory of the world people's revolution under the leadership of the proletariat, following the victory of the October Revolution and the victory of the anti-fascist war. This victory has greatly strengthened the world democratic camp. However, to prevent war, it is necessary to mobilize the broad masses of the people to fight for lasting peace and people's democracy, to participate in the worldwide movement for peace, to be vigilant, to expose the conspiracies of imperialist war-mongers, and to expose and crush traitors like Tito and imperialist spy gangs like those in the Hungarian treason case. In the ideological struggle, it is necessary to refute all the reactionary propaganda of British and American imperialism, to propagate the inevitable demise of capitalism, and to propagate Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. When talking about domestic issues, Minister Lu emphasized that the success of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference was a great victory for the liberation cause of the Chinese people. He called on members of the Chinese Communist Party and all cultural and publishing workers to study Chairman Mao's opening speech at the CPPCC and the Common Program of the CPPCC, and to strive for their full realization. Regarding future publishing work, Minister Lu pointed out that the compilation and publication of party documents, speeches by responsible comrades of the party, and classical Marxist-Leninist works should be taken very seriously. Xinhua bookstores in various regions should reprint them according to the latest versions of the Liberation Press and the Xinhua Bookstore General Store. Textbooks should gradually be nationalized. Other publishing work should have an overall plan, with division of labor and cooperation. Minister Lu called on Xinhua Bookstore to actively participate in the preparation work of the Central People's Government Publishing Administration, to greatly strengthen the leadership and unity of the national publishing industry, to explain the cultural and educational policies of the Central People's Government to the private publishing industry, and to encourage them to work according to the general policy. We must take the initiative and actively do supply and promotion work, and do not adopt a passive attitude. Publishing and distribution should pay attention to the needs of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and do not forget this point because of entering the city, while also meeting the needs of students and intellectuals.
    Hu Yuzhi's report first discussed the historical development of China's publishing industry. Then, he talked about the people's publishing industry. He said: In the past thirty years, every people's revolutionary movement has brought new development to the people's publishing industry. These people's publishing industries have played a significant role in the revolution. People's publishing workers have worked hard and persevered in their positions despite setbacks. The reactionary forces' attempts to "win with quantity" were in vain. Hu Yuzhi said: One of the characteristics and shortcomings of China's publishing industry is that publishing and distribution are generally not separated. This is an obstacle to the further development of publishing work, and division of labor and specialization should be gradually achieved. He also said: Another characteristic of China's publishing industry is that periodicals are particularly developed. In the case of difficult material conditions and the inability to publish a large number of books, publishing some good magazines is still a good way to provide spiritual food. Therefore, we should still make good use of the weapon of periodicals. Hu Yuzhi raised some issues that urgently need to be resolved in the current publishing work, with particular emphasis on the unity and leadership of the national publishing industry and the establishment of national publishing institutions.

　　新华书店出版会议第二日
    陆部长作政治报告
    胡愈之报告全国出版事业概况
    【新华社北京六日电】四日为全国新华书店出版工作会议第二日，上午中共中央宣传部长陆定一作政治报告。下午胡愈之作关于全国出版事业概况的报告。陆部长论及国际形势时，着重指出第二次世界大战以后世界上两大阵营——世界反帝民主阵营和世界帝国主义反动阵营之间的力量对比已发生巨大变化。他说：以苏联为首的世界人民民主力量完全有可能制止第三次世界大战的爆发。中国革命的胜利，是继十月革命和反法西斯战争胜利之后，在无产阶级领导之下的世界人民革命的第三个大胜利，这个胜利大大加强了世界民主阵营。但要制止战争，就要动员广大人民为争取持久和平和人民民主而斗争，就要参加全世界为和平而斗争的运动，就要提高警惕，揭破帝国主义战争贩子的阴谋活动，揭露和粉碎象铁托那样的叛徒，和象在匈牙利叛国案中那样的帝国主义的间谍匪帮。在思想斗争中，就要驳斥一切美英帝国主义的反动宣传，就要宣传资本主义的必然灭亡，就要宣传马列主义和毛泽东思想。谈到国内问题时，陆部长着重地说明：人民政治协商会议的成功，是中国人民解放事业的伟大胜利。他号召中国共产党党员及全体文化、出版工作者学习毛主席在人民政协会议上的开幕词和人民政协共同纲领等文件，并为其全部实现而奋斗。关于今后的出版工作，陆部长指出：对于党的文件、党的负责同志的言论、马列主义古典著作等的编译出版，应该十分认真和郑重其事，各地新华书店都要根据解放社和新华书店总店的最新版本翻印。教科书应逐渐做到国营。其他出版工作应有全盘计划，分工合作。陆部长号召新华书店要积极参加中央人民政府出版总署的筹建工作，要大大加强领导和团结全国出版业的工作，要把中央人民政府的文化教育政策向私营出版业讲清楚，鼓励他们根据总的政策进行工作。要主动而积极地做供应工作和推广工作，不要采取消极被动的态度。出版发行要注意供应工农兵的需要，不要因为进入城市而忘记了这一点，同时也要供应学生知识分子的需要。
    胡愈之的报告，首先论述中国出版事业的历史发展。接着，他讲到人民出版事业，他说：近三十年来每一次人民革命运动，都使得人民出版事业有一个新的发展，这些人民出版事业，在革命中起着很大的作用。人民出版工作者坚苦奋斗，前仆后继地坚持了阵地，使得反动势力方面虽然企图“以量胜质”，也是枉然。胡愈之说：中国出版业的一个特点和缺点是出版与发行一般不分工，这是出版工作进一步发展的一个阻碍，应该逐步做到分工和专业化。他又说：中国出版业的另一个特点就是期刊特别发达。在物质条件困难不能大量出版各种书籍的情况下，出一些好的杂志还是供应精神食粮的一个好办法。因此，期刊这个武器，我们仍应很好地掌握。胡愈之提出了一些目前出版工作中急需解决的问题，其中特别强调全国出版事业的团结和领导问题，和建立国家出版机构的问题。
