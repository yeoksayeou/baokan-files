　　[Beijing News] Due to an outbreak of plague in the Chahar North region, the Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau has notified district offices to suspend registration for immigration to Chahar North starting yesterday (the 28th). For immigrant households that have already registered, with the exception of the 931 people who arrived in Chahar in four batches before the 26th, those who have not yet departed will be suspended from departure as the Chahar North region will soon enter a freezing period, making resettlement difficult. Immigration to Suiyuan has already reached its quota. The original plan was to depart from Beijing yesterday, passing through Zhangjiakou to Suiyuan. However, due to the epidemic prevention, the railway, highway, and pedestrian routes between Beijing and Zhangjiakou have been completely blocked. It has also been decided to suspend departure. Once transportation is restored, the Suiyuan Provincial Government will send personnel to receive them in the province.

　　赴察移民停止登记
    【北京讯】察北地区发生鼠疫，本市民政局已通知各区区公所自昨（二十八）日起停止移民察北的登记工作。已经登记的移民户，除在二十六日以前已分四批抵察的九三一人外，其余尚未出发者，因察北不久即届冰冻期，安置不便，一律停止出发。绥远移民已经登记满额，原定昨日离京经张家口转赴绥远，现京张间铁路公路与人行路因防疫已全部实行封锁，亦决定暂停出发。一俟交通恢复后，再由绥远省政府派员接赴该省。
