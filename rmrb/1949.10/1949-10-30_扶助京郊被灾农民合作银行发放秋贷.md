　　Helping Disaster-Stricken Farmers in the Suburbs of Beijing: Cooperative Banks Issue Autumn Loans
    [This newspaper] News: The business department of the Cooperative Bank compiled the autumn loan reports submitted by its branch offices in Changxindian, Haidian, Fengtai, and other suburban areas of Beijing this month, and is beginning to summarize the experience of this loan issuance.

    This autumn loan issuance in the suburbs of Beijing focused on supporting the production of disaster-stricken farmers. The loan issuance period started on September 15th and ended on October 5th, with a total of 231,207 catties of wheat seeds loaned out (including more than 28,000 catties of improved varieties) and 497,500 catties of fertilizer. A total of 150 administrative villages and 4,872 farming households received wheat seeds, and 47 administrative villages and 911 farming households received fertilizer. According to the local sowing and fertilization situation, the wheat seeds loaned out this time can be used to sow 18,457 mu of land, and the fertilizer can fertilize 3,227 mu of land. In this loan issuance, government organizations cooperated with farmers to make declarations in order to determine the loan recipients. At the same time, the Beijing Supply and Marketing Cooperative General Agency assisted in completing transportation, procurement, distribution, and other tasks. The wheat seeds were directly loaned in kind, and the manure fertilizer was converted into money based on the actual price. During the issuance, the spirit of "satisfying one household counts as one household, solving one village counts as one village" was implemented for concentrated use.

    According to the preliminary comprehensive reports from various districts, this year's autumn loans in the suburbs of Beijing have basically been completed according to the original plan. Considerable achievements have been made in focusing on supporting the production of disaster-stricken farmers and promoting improved varieties. For example, among the 179 villages affected by the disaster this summer, 150 villages received wheat seeds, accounting for more than 83 percent of the disaster-stricken villages, and 47 villages received fertilizer, accounting for 26 percent of the disaster-stricken villages. During the loan issuance, some work groups in individual districts experienced the phenomenon of dispersed use of loans. For example, in the 17th district, they did not understand the intention of issuing autumn loans and formulated a distribution plan on their own, allocating 15,000 catties of wheat seeds and 100,000 catties of manure fertilizer to 200 natural villages, mainly targeting the families of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, and workers, as well as the elderly, weak, orphaned, and widowed, resulting in egalitarian and dispersed use, and also a paternalistic view. These errors were promptly corrected after they were discovered. In addition, this loan demonstrated that the effect of lending in kind is good. According to post-loan surveys, the wheat seeds loaned out this time have all been used for production, especially the improved varieties, which are most popular among farmers in the suburbs.

　　扶助京郊被灾农民合作银行发放秋贷
    【本报讯】合作银行营业部在本月中汇集了所属京郊长辛店、海淀、丰台等办事处本年发放秋贷报告材料，正在着手总结此次贷放经验。
    此次发放京市郊区秋贷，以扶植京郊被灾农民生产为重心。贷放时间自九月十五日开始，至十月五日结束，共贷出麦种廿三万一千二百零七斤（内有优良品种二万八千余斤），肥料四十九万七千五百余斤。得到麦种者计有一百五十个行政村，四千八百七十二户农民。获得肥料者有四十七个行政村，农民九百十一户。根据当地播种、施肥的情况，此次贷放的麦种可播种一万八千四百五十七亩，肥料可肥田三千二百二十七亩。在这次发放贷款中配合政权组织农民进行自报，以确定贷放对象。同时由京供销合作总社协助完成运输、采购、发放等工作。贷放的麦种是直接贷实，粪肥是按实物折款。在发放时并贯彻了“满足一户算一户，解决一村算一村”的集中使用精神。
    据初步综合各区汇报材料看，本年京郊秋贷基本上已照原定计划完成。在重点扶植被灾农民生产及推广优良品种上，都获得相当成就。如在今夏被灾的一百七十九个村中，获得麦种的有一百五十个村，占被灾村百分之八十三强，获得肥料的四十七个村中，占被灾村百分之二十六。在发放贷款中，有个别区的工作组，曾经发生贷款分散使用现象，如第十七区，不明了发放秋贷意图，自行订定发放计划，将一万五千斤麦种、十万斤粪肥分配到二百个自然村，对象多是烈、军、工属及老、弱、孤、寡等，平均主义分散使用，同时还有恩赐观点。这些错误被发觉后，已及时纠正。另外，此次贷款中证明：贷实的效果是好的。经贷后调查，此次贷出之麦种均已用于生产，特别是优良品种，最受郊区农民的欢迎。
