　　To Chairman Mao, Vice Chairmen Zhu, Liu, Song, Li, Zhang, and Gao, and the Central People's Government:

　　We warmly celebrate the establishment of the Central People's Government and will make our utmost efforts to thoroughly implement the current great charter of the Chinese people—the Common Program of the People's Political Consultative Conference—and defend the victorious achievements gained by our people through decades of struggle. We know that the remnants of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism will not be reconciled to defeat, and they will certainly try every means to undermine our solemn nation-building cause. However, we will absolutely not allow them to undermine it. We will resolutely carry the revolutionary war through to the end and be ready at any time to obey the orders of the Central Government to completely, thoroughly, and decisively eliminate all remaining bandit troops, consolidate national defense, and defend our great motherland.
  　　　Respectfully congratulates all commanders and fighters of the East China Military Region and the Third Field Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army

　　Hearing the news of the successful closing of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the declaration of the establishment of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, the Party, government, army, and people in Central China are all rejoicing and greatly excited. The birth of a new China that is independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, and prosperous not only demonstrates that the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, have achieved unprecedented national unity and have defeated their enemies, but also shows that the new China has entered the international political arena with a brand-new attitude and powerful strength, becoming an important factor in safeguarding world peace. The Party, government, army, and people in Central China are determined to wholeheartedly support the Central People's Government and unite as one to strive to implement the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, carry the revolutionary war through to the end, eliminate the remaining Chiang Kai-shek and Bai Chongxi bandit gangs, liberate the entire national territory, and complete the great cause of unifying China. At the same time, we will overcome all difficulties, restore and develop the economic and cultural construction of the people's motherland, consolidate the national defense of the people's motherland, protect the people's motherland from any foreign imperialist aggression, crush the restoration conspiracy of internal counter-revolutionary remnants, and unite with international friends, especially the Soviet Union and other new democratic countries, to strive for lasting world peace.
