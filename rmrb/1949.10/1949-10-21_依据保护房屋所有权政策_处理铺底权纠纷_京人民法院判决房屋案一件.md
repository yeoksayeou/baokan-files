  Beijing People's Court Rules on a Housing Case
  [Beijing News] The Beijing People's Court recently ruled on a dispute case involving overdue rent and refusal to vacate a house under the pretext of having squatter's rights. The defendant, Liu Binqing, rented a house at No. 28 Qianwai Street, Beijing, from the plaintiff, the Beijing Branch of the Datong Bank, on March 1, 1947, to open a trunk shop. Both parties agreed that the monthly rent would be 100,000 yuan in puppet currency. If there were any arrears, the landlord would be entitled to take back the house. In December of the same year, the rent was increased to 500,000 yuan in puppet currency. Since October of the following year, the defendant had not paid rent. When the rent arrears began, the plaintiff notified the defendant to fulfill the lease, but the defendant ultimately failed to do so. Therefore, the plaintiff requested the defendant to vacate the house. The defendant could not deny the plaintiff's reasons, but claimed that he had squatter's rights and wanted the plaintiff to pay a moving fee of 1,300 bags of flour before he would vacate the house. The court held that squatter's rights were originally the result of a previous business that was failing or unable to repay debts, so the business was sold. This nature is only a matter of rights and obligations between the seller and the buyer and cannot be used to oppose a third party, let alone the property owner. If, because of squatter's rights, the house is seized and held permanently, it would implicitly cancel the owner's ownership, which violates our current policy of protecting housing ownership. Moreover, there was an agreement between the parties when renting the house that "the landlord is entitled to take back the house if rent is in arrears." Therefore, the People's Court ordered the defendant to vacate the house at No. 28 Qianwai Street and return it to the plaintiff, and to pay the arrears from October 1948 until the date of eviction, at a rate of five bags of flour per month. However, in order to ensure that the defendant's business is not affected, the plaintiff should provide a reasonable subsidy for moving expenses.

　　依据保护房屋所有权政策
  　处理铺底权纠纷
  京人民法院判决房屋案一件
  【北京讯】京市人民法院顷判决一件拖欠房租，借口有铺底权而拒不腾房的纠纷案。被告刘彬卿于一九四七年三月一日租到原告大同银行北京分行前外大街二十被号房屋一所，开设箱子铺营业，双方言明每月租金伪法币十万元，倘有拖欠，任凭房主收房。同年十二月增租为伪法币五十万元。自翌年十月份起被告即未交租。在开始欠租时，原告就通知八告履行租约，而被告终未履行，因此原告请求被告腾房；被告对原告所持理由无可否认，惟称他有铺底权，要原告出一千三百袋面粉的搬家费，才给腾房。法院认为铺底权本是当日被接倒的上手商号因为自己无法经营生意或为无力偿债，所以出卖了铺底，这种性质，只是出倒人与倒得人双方的权利义务关系，不能用来对抗第三人，更无权对抗房屋所有人。如果因为有铺底权而竟把房子把持起来，永为己有，无形中取消了房主的所有权，是违反我们今天保护房屋所有权的政策的，何况租房时双方还有“拖欠房租任凭房主收房”的协议，因此，人民法院判令被告将前外大街二十八号房屋腾交与原告收回，并补交自一九四八年十月起至腾房日止之欠租，每月通粉五袋。但为照顾被告的营业不受损失，原告应酌量补助其相当的搬家费。
