Speech at the Inaugural Meeting of the China Written Language Reform Association
    Li Jinxi

    Today, I am honored by the presence of representatives of overseas Chinese. The Chinese written language reform movement and the national language unification movement have always been interconnected. Thirty years ago, taking overseas Chinese in Nanyang as an example, most were from Guangdong and Fujian. Guangdong and Fujian are neighboring provinces, but when they met and talked, it was like foreigners; Chaozhou and Guangzhou were even fellow villagers, but when people from these two places listened to a Northerner's speech, they needed two translators. If they both understood English, they would use English instead of the national language; if they were both scholars, they would use writing to communicate instead of speaking. This situation gradually changed after 1919, when most overseas Chinese primary and secondary schools began to learn the national phonetic alphabet, and gradually most were able to speak or understand the standard spoken language of the motherland. Overseas Chinese and the motherland, by unifying the language, further increased the strength of unity. Especially in Taiwan, since its restoration, although politically it is still under the control of the Kuomintang reactionaries, socially, they warmly welcomed the national phonetic alphabet, considering it the only effective tool to overcome the difficulties of Chinese characters. The national phonetic alphabet is the tool for the first stage of Chinese written language reform. In the future, I hope that overseas compatriots will exchange information on language education and submit better opinions to this association.

    Today, I am also honored by the presence of representatives of domestic ethnic minorities. Our languages and scripts are different from each other. If we want to communicate quickly, the only effective way is to imitate the effective methods of the Soviet Union, which is to "Latinize" the languages and scripts of all ethnic groups, because the pronunciation of Latin Roman letters is uniformly regulated and the same for everyone. With Latinized phonetic script, as long as you pronounce it, you can understand each other. The past national language movement did not take this into account. Only ten years ago, in 1940, we suggested a "blitz" policy for communicating border languages, which was to compile and print "four-line textbooks" with phonetic transcriptions of a certain border language and Chinese for comparison. A sample booklet was published at Northwest Normal College in Lanzhou, Gansu, using the Amdo Tibetan dialect prevalent in Xining, Qinghai, as a trial. This suggestion was opposed by the Kuomintang government. In the future, with the great unity of the people of the whole country, we must first communicate the freely developing languages and scripts that are different from each other. "Blitz" communication and "Latinized" communication, this association guarantees that it can be done.

    Originally, we wanted to invite Soviet representatives from international friends, but we did not invite them because they were too busy and probably could not attend. Soviet scholars have always been very concerned about our written language reform movement. I remember in 1929, several professors from Moscow University came to China, arrived in Beijing, stayed at the Beijing Hotel, and had a meeting with me and Mr. Qian Xuantong, because at that time we had already formulated and announced the spelling method of "National Language Romanization," and they paid close attention to this matter. Unfortunately, the time was short, and at that time we only gave them all the publications and did not have detailed discussions. Two years later, in 1931, the "Latinized Chinese Alphabet" was also formulated and announced. This shows that Soviet scholars have been concerned about our written language reform movement for more than 20 years.

    This China Written Language Reform Association was initiated on May 29th of this year, under the leadership of Chairman Wu Yuzhang, when he and I invited eight or nine linguists in Beijing to hold an initiators' meeting at the Teachers' College, and then continued to hold meetings at Huabei University to discuss preparations. The number of initiators also increased by more than ten. After more than four months, we are holding this inaugural meeting today. This association is a purely academic research group, and the name of the association is "China Written Language Reform Association." Why do we need to reform the fine Chinese characters? The goal is for the masses of the people, for the education of the masses of the people, for the popularization of the education of the masses of the people, and for the popularization and improvement of the education of the masses of the people. At the first initiators' meeting on May 29th, everyone summarized the various issues to be discussed and resolved in this written language reform into four aspects: first, the alphabet problem; second, the Chinese character problem; third, the standardization of dialects; and fourth, the popularization and educationalization of literature and art. Originally, we planned to hold the general meeting in August, but because I have been handling matters related to these issues for more than 40 years, I prepared to write a report, which turned out to be nearly 100,000 words, so I had to print it into a book called "On New Chinese Characters," and present it to you for your guidance. Today, due to time constraints, I cannot speak much. Because I am afraid it is too long and you will not be able to finish reading it, I have added two and a half pages of "outlines" to the beginning, please take some time to browse through them and give your criticism. This "outline" is very simple, but there are also a few simpler explanations, that is, the whole book contains three important documents, which serve as the backbone of the whole book: first, the "Declaration of the National Language Movement Congress" in 1926, distributed on pages 10, 27, and 33; second, the five concluding points of the "Hankou Consultation" between Latinization proponents and National Language Romanization proponents in 1938, on page 48; and third, the declaration on the origin of the "New Script Association" in Yan'an in 1940, on page 25. These three documents can all serve as important references for the future work of this association; because they are all comprehensive opinions and the spirit of agreement. Please note, gentlemen, that this association is named China Written Language Reform Association, and we want to fully implement this word "agreement"! Taking the first aspect of the alphabet scheme as an example, although we advocate using Latin Roman letters as the main basis, and we advocate using the "Latinized New Script of Northern Dialect" as the foundation, if members have new schemes, they can submit them to this association as much as possible, and the board of directors will form a special committee to study them. The result of the research is that even if everyone thinks that the scheme is not convenient to promote, it should be displayed as the association's literature, and the creator's hard work will never be buried. I myself emphasize that in the transitional period when Chinese characters cannot be abolished and the new script is not yet sound, in addition to the new script textbooks for beginners, the announcements of various agencies and the textbooks of various schools and subjects should be printed with a combination of the new script and Chinese characters. Therefore, I have also prepared a new scheme to match the printing of Chinese characters, and I have now printed a notice and presented it to you along with the book, please also give your criticism. Moreover, the printed matter of this kind of "new phonetic Chinese characters" that is being designed does not yet have the material and economic conditions, and cannot be produced in large quantities. Before this, the current old phonetic Chinese characters, which have gradually been completed over the past 20 years, should still be restored and developed, and allowed to temporarily act as agents. Therefore, I have also attached two kinds of printed materials of phonetic Chinese characters, hoping that the education community will consider them. Such gifts seem to have a bit of a commercial suspicion, but this printing factory is not privately run, it is state-owned.

    In short, the goal of this association is for the masses of the people, and the work of this association should be "seeking truth from facts." Everyone should abide by the "scientific attitude and responsible spirit," and jointly study and discuss, and naturally we can come to a "correct" and "suitable for our nation" conclusion. Our hope is that "the internationalized, popularized, and scientific new national language will appear in a revolutionary posture. At present, it must still form a 'united front' with the old script, that is, use the new phonetic Chinese characters to broadcast, promote, and accelerate the construction of new democratic culture; this new script will gradually become popular in all regions of the country, it will gradually be used in all social strata, and then it will be replaced by the old script, and together with the new democracy under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, it will be promoted to the new stage of socialism." We should raise our hands to welcome it!

　　在中国文字改革协会成立大会上的讲话
    黎锦熙
    今天承蒙海外华侨代表光临，中国文字改革运动和国语统一运动，向来是互相联系的。在三十年前，海外华侨，只举南洋为例，广东福建的人居多。广东福建是邻省，见面谈话如同外国人；潮州和广州更是同乡，两处的人听一个北方人演说，就要用两个翻译。彼此懂得英语，就用英语来代替国语；彼此都是读书人，就用笔谈来代口说。这种情形到了一九一九年后，华侨中小学大都学习国语注音字母，渐渐大都能说或听懂祖国普通话了。海外侨胞和祖国，把语言搞通了，所以更增加了团结的力量。尤其是台湾，光复以来，政治方面虽然至今还在国民党反动派势力之下，但是社会方面，曾经热烈地欢迎国语注音字母，认为克服汉字困难的唯一的利器。国语注音字母就是中国文字改革的第一阶段的工具，今后希望海外的同胞们交换语文教育的情报，并提出更好的意见到本会来。
    今天又承蒙国内少数民族的代表光临，咱们的语言文字各不相同，彼此如果要迅速地沟通起来，只有仿照苏联的有效办法，就是把各民族的语言文字一律都“拉丁化”，因为拉丁罗马字母的发音统一规定，是彼此一样的。拉丁化的拼音文字，只要照着念出来，就可以互相了解的。过去的国语运动没有照顾到这一方面。直到十年前，一九四○年，我们曾经建议一种“突击式”的边疆语文沟通政策，就是编印某种边语和汉语对照注音的“四行课本”，在甘肃兰州的西北师范学院曾经出过一册样本，是就青海西宁一带通行的西藏语阿木杂方言试办的。这种建议，国民党政府方面表示反对。今后全国人民大团结，咱们首先要把各不相同自由发展的语言文字沟通起来，“突击式”的沟通，“拉丁化”的沟通，本会保证一定可以办到。
    本来我们想邀请国际友人苏联代表，因为他们太忙恐不能到会，所以未请，苏联的学者们对于我们这个文字改革运动，向来是很关心的。记得是一九二九年，莫斯科大学有几位教授来到中国，到了北京，住在北京饭店，和我，还有钱玄同先生，曾经有过一次接洽，因为那时我们已经把“国语罗马字”的拼音法式制定公布，他们很注意这件事。可惜时间匆促，那时候只送给他们全部刊物，并没有详细的商量讨论。又过了两年，一九三一年，“拉丁化的中国字母”也就制定公布出来了。这是说明苏联的学者们二十多年来一直关心我们的文字改革运动。
    这个中国文字改革协会，是本年五月二十九日，在主席吴老玉章领导之下，我和他两人邀请在北京的语文学者八九位共同发起，在师大开了一个发起人会议，以后继续在华大开会商讨筹备，发起人也增加了十几位，经过四个多月，到今天才开这个成立大会。本会是一个纯粹的学术研究团体，会名就是“中国文字改革协会”。好好的中国文字，为什么还要改革呢？目标就是为人民大众，为人民大众的教育，为人民大众教育的普及，为人民大众教育的普及与提高。在五月二十九开第一次发起人会议时，大家把这文字改革的各种待讨论解决的问题，归纳为四方面：第一是字母问题；第二是汉字问题；第三是方言标准统一化问题；第四是文艺大众化教育化问题。本来是打算在八月里开大会的，我因为自己经手办理关于这些问题的事项经过了四十来年，预备写一点儿报告，写多了，差不多十万字，只好印成一本书，名“国语新文字论”，奉赠各位，请求指教。今天因为时间关系，不能多讲。因为怕长，诸位看不完，所以卷头又安上两个半篇子的“纲目”，务请各位抽点儿工夫一览，予以批评。这个“纲目”很简单，但还有更简单的几句说明，就是全书之中，包含了三种重要文件，做全书的骨干：第一是一九二六年的“全国国语运动大会宣言”，分配在第十页，二十七页，三十三页，第二是一九三八年拉丁化论者和国语罗马字论者的“汉口协商”的总结五条，在第四十八页；第三是一九四○年延安“新文字协会”缘起宣言，在第二十五页。这三种文件，都可作为本会今后工作上的重要参考；因为它们都是综合的意见，协议的精神。请各位先生注意，本会定名中国文字改革协会，我们就是要充分地做好这个“协”字！就以第一方面字母方案问题为例，我们虽然主张以拉丁罗马字母为主，而且主张就把“北方话拉丁化新文字”做个底子，但会员之中如有新的方案，都可以尽量提出，送交本会，由理事会组成专门委员会来研究，研究的结果，就是大家认为不便推行的方案，也当陈列为本会的文献，决不埋没创作者一番心血。我本人是强调在汉字还不能废，新文字还未健全的过渡时期，除初学的新文字课本外，各机关公告各学校各科课本，都应该把新文字和汉字结合起来印刷的，所以也拟了一个新方案配合汉字印刷，现在印了一张启事，随书送呈各位，也请予以批评。并且正在设计中的这种“新注音汉字”的印刷品，还没有具备物质的经济的条件，还不能大量地生产，在这以前，现行的旧注音汉字，是二十年来好容易才逐渐完成的物质供献，还应该设法恢复，发展，让它暂行代理，所以又附赠两种注音汉字印刷的读物，希望教育界予以考虑。这样的赠品似乎有点儿商业化的嫌疑，但这个印刷工厂不是私人办的，是国营的。
    总而言之，本会的目标是为人民大众，本会的工作要“实事求是”，大家遵守着“科学的态度与负责的精神”，共同研究讨论，自然可以得出“正确”而“适合我们民族”的结论来。我们的希望是“国际化，大众化，科学化的国语新文字，将要以革命的姿态出现，目前它还要与旧文字组成‘统一战线’，即用新注音汉字，来广播、推动、并加快新民主主义的文化建设；这种新文字，它将逐渐普及于全国各区域，它将逐渐通用于社会各阶层，然后和旧文字实行禅代，跟着毛泽东主席领导下的新民主主义一同推进到社会主义的新阶段去。”我们应该举起手来迎接它！
