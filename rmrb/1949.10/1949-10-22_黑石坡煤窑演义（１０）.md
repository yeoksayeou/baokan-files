    Over here, Yu Bao was already terrified, his legs trembling uncontrollably. He was utterly at a loss, not knowing whether to leave or stay. After a long while, he stammered, "Your old… your old health is… is important. Don't… don't get angry and hurt… hurt yourself! Rest… rest a bit!" Jubao suddenly darted three steps in front of Yu Bao and shouted, "Yu Bao! Are you here to be a matchmaker for Xilu? Or are you going to spend the next few days with me? Huh? What are you doing?" Yu Bao was drenched in cold sweat. He lowered his head, not daring to look at anyone, and answered through chattering teeth, "I… I wouldn't dare! I… I… obey your old… old… orders… one… one… hundred percent!" Jubao said, "Good! That's the spirit! Yu Bao, Xilu didn't make you a foreman, but I'll make you a 'foreman'! You find a way to get the coal mine into my hands so that Da San will work hard for me too! If you can't, then drive Da San away and sabotage Xilu's operation! I've told Qian Danao all my ideas, so ask him about everything! Ask him for help with the shortfall in supplies. And report any movements to me in person!" After saying that, Jubao turned his head and shouted, "Yan Wan! Are you dead?" Bai Quanjia hurried in. Jubao took the boiling water and the opium pills, swallowed a few with the water, slapped his behind, and went into the inner room without even putting on his shoes.
    At this moment, Yu Bao suddenly felt hot all over, as if the cold sweat had turned into hot sweat. His body was trembling so much that he couldn't even take a step forward. Bai Quanjia in the room didn't recognize Yu Bao, except that she had given him opium pills once a few days ago. This time, she assumed the owner had invited him for a drink and he was drunk. She didn't like Yu Bao at all and thought, what kind of person is this! She pointed for Yu Bao to leave. Yu Bao was shocked to see a young girl standing so close to him. He suddenly sobered up and quickly walked away. Bai Quanjia didn't know what was going on, so she chased him a few steps, wondering if this guy had gone crazy.
    Ten Worries
    Let's return to Da San. Since staying in the village, he had been wandering around every day, looking at the mountain ranges and coal seams, and examining the various small earthen kilns in the village. There were two types of earthen kilns in this area. One type, like the one he had opened for Xilu, was dug horizontally into the base of a slope. After entering the kiln entrance, you would walk down a gentle slope. The smaller ones were for people carrying coal directly up and down, called "carrying kilns." The larger ones, like the one he had opened for Xilu, were large enough for livestock to carry coal directly up and down, called "hauling kilns." The other type was a well dug on flat ground to open a kiln. Since there were no machines in the countryside, a windlass frame was set up at the wellhead, similar to drawing water. Several people would wind the windlass, using thick ropes to haul people and coal up and down. This was called a "winding kiln." Da San had worked in both types of kilns, but of the ones in the village, some he had worked in before, but now they were collapsed or flooded and no one was taking care of them. Others were new kilns that he had never worked in. The only old kiln that he had worked in before and was still operating was one in the village. Da San never failed to ask people about the conditions of each kiln. He also never failed to wander around the new kiln he had opened, chatting with people about how to start construction after autumn. There were also two large kilns in neighboring villages that operated non-stop in summer and autumn. He also went to take a look at them. People even invited him to be a foreman, and he wanted to go, but he knew that they already had foremen, and he couldn't steal a living from his fellow professionals. So he rejected them all, suppressing the urge that made his heart race whenever he saw a coal kiln, and stayed in the village, feeling bored.
    Later, Da San often visited people's homes and gradually became familiar with the villagers. Unfortunately, there were not many people he could connect with. Besides his second brother, Tianlu, and Liugou's family, who often came to his house to sit, only Little Foreign Devil was someone he could talk to and confide in. These days, Da San always looked for Little Foreign Devil to rest and chat with.
    Little Foreign Devil's real name was Zhang Jicheng. He was a generation younger than Da San, but he was older than Da San. His family had been in and out of coal kilns for generations, but his father and brother had unfortunately been killed by coal in the pits. A few years ago, his brother had also died in the same way. He became so sad that he washed his hands and never did that line of work again. He rented a few acres of land from Jubao in the village and, during the off-season, he carried a carrying pole. Not far from this village was a village called Little West Village. Most of the families in that village made clay pots and clay teapots. He was also the son-in-law of Little West Village, so he often carried clay goods to his brother-in-law's house to sell. This man had loved telling jokes since he was a child. People said he was useless, and he often said, "I was born to be so tricky and mischievous, I'm really not material for anything. I've also thought: I'm not young anymore, why can't I ever settle down! My wife has also advised me, but it's always useless! I'm afraid a ghost has possessed my mouth, it's not up to me, I just talk nonsense when I see something!" He had also worked in kilns outside, and he had even met a Japanese mining technician. After returning to the village, he would imitate the Japanese man's speech and walk in front of everyone, making people laugh. He was short and thin, so people called him "Little Foreign Devil." He didn't say anything, he would answer whoever called him that name. Sometimes a three or four-year-old child would call him that, he would answer and make a funny face to scare the child, making them cry. Then he would pick them up and coax them, then take them back home. The child's mother would scold him a few times, and he would argue and laugh with her. Because of this, Little Foreign Devil had good relationships with people and was very familiar with the Yangquan station. Several grocery stores took turns having him deliver various kinds of clay goods. In winter and spring, and when he had nothing to do in the fields in summer and autumn, he would go to Little West Village early in the morning to carry clay goods, and return from Yangquan station before noon. At this time, he would carry a load of salt, oil, thread, shoe cloth... These were things that the villagers asked him to bring back every day. He would deliver them to each house, saying to this house: "For this cloth, I ran out of all the cloth stores at the station, it was so much trouble! You still haven't paid! Hurry up and give me the money! I won't bring anything for you in the future!" To that house, he would say: "This oil bottle almost fell and broke! It's so troublesome! I'll never bring anything for you again!" People took the goods, paid the money, some scolded him, some said a few nice words, offered him a bowl of vegetable soup and a cornbread bun. He wouldn't accept it no matter what, arguing back and forth, and finally he would just take a sip of soup, pick off a piece of cornbread, and run away, cursing, "I've never seen such troublesome people... I'll never bring anything for you again..." But in the late afternoon, a group of men, women, old and young would come looking for him, this one saying: "Little Foreign Devil! Here! This is the money. Bring back two boxes of fireworks tomorrow..." That one saying: "Little Foreign Devil! Bring me half a pound of vinegar, I'll pay you when you get back!" Little Foreign Devil cursed again, pretending not to want to bring them, but he took all the money and things. The next day when he came back, it would be a full load again.

　　黑石坡煤窑演义（１０）
    康濯
    这边玉宝早吓得浑身发凉，腿哆嗦得怎么也制不住，直＠＠地走也不是在也不是，老半天才吞吞吐吐道：“你老人家身……身子要要紧，可……可别动气伤……伤火的！歇……歇歇吧！”聚宝隙忽地三步窜到玉宝跟前，大声嚷道：“玉宝！你倒是来给喜禄当说合人的？还是要跟我过两天？啊？你怎么？”玉宝不觉一身冷汗，低着脑袋不敢看人，嗑碰着牙齿回答道：“可……可不敢！你老……老人家吩咐……咐……我一……一……一百个听……听从！”聚宝道：“好！就这句话！玉宝，喜禄没叫你当上领事，我叫你当‘领事’！你想法把窑闹到我手下，让大三也好好跟我干！要是闹不成的话，就给我撵走大三，拆他妈喜禄的台！我的主意我都跟乾大脑说了，一切你问他去！短花的缺帮手，也问他。有什么动静，给我当面报讯！”说完，聚宝又回头喊道：“烟丸！人死了么？”白泉家忙着赶进来，聚宝接过开水和大烟丸，随水吞下了几颗，屁股一拍，鞋也忘了穿，就进里间屋里去了。    这时玉宝忽地浑身发烫，只觉着冷汗变成了热汗，身子哆嗦得想往外走也迈不开腿；屋里白泉家过去并不认识玉宝，只前几天给了他一回大烟丸，这回又当是东家请他喝酒喝醉了；她看着玉宝这人挺不顺眼，心想这是个什么人啊！一边就手指着引玉宝出去；玉宝一看，见是个年岁不大的闺女紧挨着他，这才大吃一惊，清醒过来，赶忙一个劲走了。后边白泉家不知道怎么回事，就追了他几步，心想；这家伙莫非疯了么？
    十心事
    这里再说大三自从留在村里以后，每天没事，就满村转游，四外里看看山势炭脉，看看村里各个小土窑。这一带土窑有两种，一种是他给喜禄开的那样，在一个坡根平着打一个窑洞，进了窑口就顺行道走慢坡下去，小的是人担炭，直上直下，叫担窑，大的，象他给喜禄开的，牲口也能直上直下驮炭，叫驮窑；再一种是平地打井开窑，乡下没机器，就在井口上安设个辘轳架子，象打水那样，好几个绞辘轳把的人，用大粗绳把人和炭绞上绞下，这叫绞窑。这两种窑大三都动弹过，只是村里这几座，有的是他过去下过，如今塌了或是被水淹了，没人照管；有的隙是他没有下过的新窑；他过去下过、这会还在动弹的老窑，村里只有一个了。大三短不了寻人打问打问各个窑的情形，也短不了在他新开的大窑周遭转转，跟人咯嚷一阵秋后该怎么下手动工；左近邻村还有两座夏秋不停的大窑，他也短不了去看看，人家还来请过他当领事，他倒也想去，但知道人家都有现成领事，不能抢同行把式的饭碗，就都回绝了，把他那股见了炭窑就心眼发跳的劲头，硬压下去，他还是别着闷着在村里住下。
    大三后来也常常窜个门子，跟村里人们也慢慢熟开了，可惜能捣拉上的人并不多，除了他老二天禄和柳沟家短不了上他屋里去坐坐，就还只有小洋鬼算是能多说两句碰心话的人；这些日子大三没事，就总是寻小洋鬼一块歇歇，捣拉一阵。
    小洋鬼本叫张吉成，他比大三小一辈，年岁隙比大三大。他家几辈子也是窑里钻进钻出，但他父亲和他哥碰巧都被炭砸死在煤坑里，几年前他兄弟也那么死了，他一谈起这就伤心落泪，从此自己洗了手再不干这一行，在村里租种聚宝几亩地，农闲时节，他就挑扁担；离这村不远有个小西庄村，那村大半人家烧砂锅砂壶，他又是小西庄的女婿，就短不了上他小舅子家担砂货出去卖。他这人从小爱说个耍笑话，人们说他不成材，他也常说：“我天生就这么鬼鬼捣捣地，真不成个材料。我也想过：年岁不小啦，怎么老不能安安份份啊！我老婆也打劝过我，可总是不行！我这张嘴怕是有鬼给缠住了，不由我作主，见了事就瞎说八道！”他也在外边下过窑，还碰见过一个日本采矿技师，后来回了村，就在众人面前学学日本人说话走道，逗人们笑笑；他长得个儿又小又瘦，因此人们就叫他“小洋鬼”。他也不说什么，谁叫他这名他都答应；有时一个三四岁的小孩也这么叫他，他答应一声，就装扮个鬼脸，吓唬那孩孩，惹得人家啼哭了，他才又上去一把抱起，又逗又哄地送人家回去，回头小孩他妈骂他两句，他也跟人家面对面骂一阵笑一阵。就因为这，小洋鬼人缘很好，阳泉站上也混得很熟，有几家杂货铺就轮着让他送各式各样砂货去，他冬春两季和夏秋地里没事的时候，差不多就是每天大早去小西庄担砂货，不到晌午，就从阳泉站上回来，这时就又担了一担咸盐啦、油啦、线啦、鞋面布啦……这是村里人们每天叫他捎的东西，他回来就一家家送去，到这家说：“为你这布，我跑光了站上的布店，可把人麻烦死啦！你还不给钱！快拿钱来！往后说什么我也不捎办啦！”到那家又说：“这油瓶差点没摔球啦！真他妈噜里噜嗦！往后可再也不捎办啦！”人们接了货，交了钱，有的骂他两句，有的说两句好的，给他盛碗菜汤拿个窝窝，他怎么也不接，争来争去，最后他只好喝一口汤，撇一块窝窝，撒腿就跑，一边骂道：“没见过他妈这么麻烦的…往后说什么再也不给你捎办了…”但到了半后晌，又有一堆男女老少寻他，这个说：“小洋鬼！给！这是钱。明个给捎两盒烟火…”那个说：“小洋鬼！给我捎半斤醋，回来给钱！”小洋鬼又一边骂着，装着不愿捎，隙都把一个个的钱和家具收下；明个回来时候，又是满满的一担。
