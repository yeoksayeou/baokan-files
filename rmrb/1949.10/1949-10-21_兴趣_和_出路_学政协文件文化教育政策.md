　　“Interest” and “Future Prospects”
  　Studying the CPPCC Document on Cultural and Educational Policies
    Beishi (Beijing Normal University) Yimin
    I often think to myself: What "future prospects" does a normal school student have? Although my classmates often explain to me that being an elementary school teacher is serving the people, I always reply with "not interested." Outside of school, I am also reluctant to say that I am a normal school student, thinking that I will be "looked down upon," so I have a "muddling along" attitude towards my studies.
    The Common Program of the People's Political Consultative Conference has been announced. I have carefully read Chapter Five on cultural and educational policies, hoping to find new regulations for normal school students, but it only says: "…The cultural and educational work of the People's Government should take raising cultural standards, cultivating talents for national construction, eliminating feudal, comprador, and fascist ideology, and developing the idea of serving the people as its main tasks" and "Implement universal education in a planned and step-by-step manner." This made me somewhat disappointed! But after detailed discussions in the study group, I realized the importance of my responsibility. Chairman Mao once said that following the economic construction upsurge will be a cultural construction upsurge. Then, the work of popularizing education is very important, and elementary school teachers are the natural executors of this work. Isn't our responsibility important? At the same time, the "interest" issue that I usually emphasize has also been resolved in the discussion: "As long as you work patiently, you will develop an interest in anything. The main thing is whether you sincerely want to serve the people." I understand that being an elementary school teacher is my glorious future prospect.
    My classmates also helped me analyze the reasons for my "dissatisfaction": the "future prospects" I had in mind before were essentially the petty-bourgeois idea of climbing upward, that is, envying those reactionary rulers during the reactionary rule, and being dissatisfied with the "road" on the people's side. My classmate Qi Chunlai said to me: The "glory" of those people is precisely their shame. They suck the blood of the people and still act arrogantly on the people's heads, so we overthrew them. The people of our new China, who have turned themselves over, have a very urgent demand for culture. Is there anything more glorious than us serving them?
    I felt my lack of knowledge and backwardness in thinking. From now on, I will never hold a "muddling along" attitude towards studying. I must seize these two years of study time to complete my professional and political studies. In order to connect with reality, I will also participate in social activities such as "literacy classes" so that I can do my best to contribute to the construction of a new China in my position.

　　“兴趣”和“出路”
  　学政协文件文化教育政策
    北师  毅民
    自己常常想：一个师范生将来有什么“出路”呀。虽是同学们也时常给我解释：当小学教师就是为人民服务，但我总以“不感兴趣”来回答。在校外也总不愿说自己是师范学校学生，以为这将被人“看不起”，因此对学习上也就抱着“混”的态度。
    人民政协的共同纲领公布了，我对第五章的文化教育政策特别仔细的看了，想在那里找出对师范生是否有新的规定，可是那里只写着：“………人民政府的文化教育工作，应以提高文化水平、培养建国人材，肃清封建的、买办的、法西斯的思想，开展为人民服务的思想为主要任务”“有计划有步骤地实行普及教育”。这可使我有些失望！但经过了学习小组的详细讨论，这才使我明白了自己责任的重大。毛主席曾说过，接着经济建设高潮而来的，将是文化建设高潮，那末普及教育的工作是很重要的，而小学教师也就是这一工作的当然执行者，我们的责任还不重大吗？同时自己平常强调的“兴趣”问题，也在讨论中得到解决：“只要耐心工作，什么事情都会产生兴趣的，主要的看你是否真心愿意为人民服务”。我明白了，当小学教师就是我的光荣出路。
    同学们又帮助我分析感到“不满”的原因：我从前所想的“出路”，实质上就是小资产阶级向上爬的思想，也就是羡慕那些在反动统治时的反动统治者们，而对人民这边的“路”不满。同学齐春来对我说：那些人的“光荣”正是他们的可耻，他们吸人民的血，还在人民头上作威作福，所以才把他们打垮了；我们新中国翻了身的人民，要求文化非常迫切，还有比我们为他们服务再光荣的事吗？
    我感到了自己学识的缺乏、思想的落后。从现在起决不再抱着“混”的学习态度了，一定要把握住这二年的学习时间，来完成业务上和政治上的学习，为了联系实际，我还要参加“识字班”等社会活动。以便在自己岗位上，尽出建设新中国的力量来。（附图片）
