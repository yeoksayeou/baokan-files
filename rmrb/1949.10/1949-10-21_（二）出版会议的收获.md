　　(II) Gains of the Publishing Conference

The National Xinhua Bookstore Publishing Work Conference has successfully concluded after seventeen days of discussion. Thanks to the concern of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the direct leadership of the Central Propaganda Department, and thanks to the efforts of all the representatives present, the conference has achieved significant gains.

The first achievement of this conference is the determination of the principle and specific measures for unified concentration and strengthening of enterprise management of the national Xinhua Bookstore. In accordance with Article 49 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the conference regarded the development of the people's publishing industry and the popularization of culture, as well as the publication of more popular reading materials, as important agenda items and conducted repeated and in-depth discussions. The conference clearly stipulated that the publishing industry in the future must first serve workers, peasants, and soldiers, and for this purpose, a large number of popular readings beneficial to the people must be published. In terms of distribution work, the distribution network must be expanded, and books and periodicals must be delivered to the hands of the broad masses of the people through various means. The conference also paid serious attention to the proofreading work of books and periodicals, and regarded proofreading work as a political task.

Resolutions have been made, which is very good. But this is only the first step. There is still a complex process to turn the resolutions into reality. It is hoped that each representative attending the conference will conduct a very good dissemination after returning. Let the staff of Xinhua Bookstores throughout the country deeply understand the resolutions and spirit of the conference, and work together to strive for the realization of the resolutions; at the same time, we must be good at uniting all private publishing industries that are beneficial to the people, and work together for the people's publishing industry of the new China. We believe that in the near future, the publishing industry of the Chinese people will take on a new look and welcome the arrival of a high tide of cultural construction.

　　（二）出版会议的收获
    全国新华书店出版工作会议经过十七天的讨论，业已胜利闭幕。由于中共中央的关心和中央宣传部的直接领导，由于到会全体代表同志的努力，会议得到了重大的收获。
    这次会议的成绩首先是确定了全国新华书店的统一集中、加强企业化经营管理的方针和具体办法。会议根据中国人民政协共同纲领第四十九条的规定，把发展人民的出版事业和普及文化、多出通俗读物当作重要议题，进行了反复深入的讨论。会议明确规定了今后的出版事业首先要为工农兵服务，为此就必须大量出版有益于人民的通俗读物。在发行工作上须扩大发行网，通过各种各样的办法，把书刊送到广大人民的手里。会议还对书刊的校对工作加以严重注意，把校对工作当作政治任务提出来。
    决议是做出来了，这是很好的。但这还只是事情的第一步，要把决议变成事实，还有一个复杂的过程。希望参加会议的每个代表回去之后，要进行很好的传达。让全国各地新华书店的工作人员都能深切理解会议的决议和精神，齐心一致为决议的实现而奋斗；同时又要善于团结一切有利于人民的私营出版业，共同为新中国的人民出版事业而努力。我们相信，不久的将来，中国人民的出版事业就将出现一个新的面目，迎接文化建设高潮的到来。
