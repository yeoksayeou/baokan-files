Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 7th. Progressive newspapers in the United States, Britain, and Denmark have been publishing articles for days, celebrating the establishment of the Central People's Government of China and praising the Soviet Union's prompt recognition of the Central People's Government.

    The editorial of the US Communist Party's organ, the New York Daily Worker, on the 5th, pointed out the great significance of China's liberation, saying: The Soviet Union's recognition of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China is an event of world importance. The Daily Worker emphasized: "The People's China must immediately occupy its seat in the United Nations." The Daily Worker concluded: The American people must force the American government to abandon its current policy of undermining peace in the Far East, force it to recognize New China and establish trade relations with it.

    The British Communist Party's organ, the London Daily Worker, published an editorial on the 5th titled "Hand of Friendship," stating: The Government of the People's Republic of China has formally announced its establishment. This is the only government in Chinese history based on the democratic will of the people. One of the new government's initial actions was to declare its willingness to establish diplomatic relations with any foreign government that respects the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for territorial sovereignty. The Soviet Union and the People's Governments of Eastern Europe have recognized People's China. However, the British government maintains a deathly official silence. The Foreign Office claims it is completely unaware of whether it has received Zhou Enlai's letter announcing the establishment of the new government and proposing the establishment of diplomatic relations. The British Conservative regime refused to recognize the Soviet Union for many years. However, the British labor movement, through its great movement, forced it to recognize it, regardless of the Conservative Party's opposition. When a Labour government is as unwilling to recognize People's China as the Conservative Party was unwilling to recognize the Soviet Union in the past, can the British labor movement stand idly by? There is no doubt that Britain's true interests require the immediate establishment of normal diplomatic and commercial relations. Everyone knows that the main opponent of this step internationally is the US State Department. It refuses to accept the lessons of its crushing defeat and continues to support the morally bankrupt and discredited remnants of the Kuomintang, especially within the United Nations. Will the British labor movement approve of such open American domination of British policy? Or will it demand the recognition of New China now with a firm voice? Some people talk about "some degree" of recognition. This opinion is not worth considering. The only policy is full recognition, and this includes immediately severing relations with the Kuomintang remnants. Non-recognition will not harm New China. It will stand invincible and move forward courageously. It must enjoy its full rights without compromise. Non-recognition will only harm Britain. New China must be recognized now.

    The Danish Communist Party's organ, "People's Ground," wrote in its monthly review of major events: The Soviet Union's possession of the atomic bomb has changed the balance of strategic forces in the world; and the proclamation of the People's Republic of China has changed the balance of reactionary and progressive forces on a global scale.

　　美英丹进步报纸欢呼新中国诞生
    敦促政府与我建立邦交
    【新华社北京七日电】美国、英国和丹麦的进步报纸连日著文，庆贺中国中央人民政府的成立，和赞扬苏联对中央人民政府的迅速承认。
    美国共产党机关报纽约工人日报五日社论在指出中国解放的重大意义时说：苏联对中华人民共和国中央人民政府的承认，是一项具有世界重要性的事件。工人日报着重说：“人民的中国必须立即在联合国中占有它的席位。”工人日报在结语中说：美国人民必须迫使美国政府放弃在远东破坏和平的现行政策，迫使它承认新中国并与之建立贸易关系。
    英国共产党机关报伦敦工人日报五日以“友谊的手”为题发表社论说：中华人民共和国政府正式宣布成立了。这是中国有史以来唯一以人民的民主意志为基础的政府。新政府的初步行动之一，就是宣布它愿意与任何遵守平等、互利及互相尊重领土主权等项原则的外国政府建立外交关系。苏联及东欧人民政府已承认了人民的中国。但是英国政府却保持死一样的官方缄默，外交部声称官方丝毫不知道已否接获周恩来宣布新政府成立和提出建立外交关系的公函。英国保守党政权曾有好几年拒绝承认苏联。但是英国的劳工运动以其伟大的运动，不顾保守党怎样反对，逼它承认。当此一个工党的政府象保守党过去不承认苏联一样不愿承认人民的中国时，英国的劳工运动能袖手旁观吗？毫无问题，英国的真正利益要求立即建立正常的外交和商务关系。每个人都知道，国际上反对这一步骤的，主要是美国国务院。它拒绝接受它的粉碎性失败的教训，仍谋继续支持精神败坏，信誉扫地的国民党残余，特别是在联合国里面。英国劳工运动会赞成美国这样的公开支配英国的政策吗？还是它将以坚决的声音要求现在承认新中国呢？有人谈到“某种程度”的承认。这种意见不值一顾。唯一的政策，是充分承认，而这包含立即断绝与国民党残余匪帮的关系。不承认无害于新中国。它将从此屹立无敌而勇往直前。它非不折不扣地享有其充分权利不可。不承认只会伤害英国。新中国必须现在就被承认。
    丹麦共产党机关报“人民园地”报每月大事栏写道：苏联之拥有原子弹，改变了世界上战略力量的均势；而中华人民共和国的宣告成立，则改变了全世界范围的反动与进步力量的对比。
