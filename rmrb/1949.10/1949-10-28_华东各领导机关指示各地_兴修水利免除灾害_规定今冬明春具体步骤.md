　　East China Leading Organs Instruct Various Regions to Build Water Conservancy Projects to Prevent Disasters, Stipulating Specific Steps for This Winter and Next Spring
    [This newspaper reported] Leading organs in various parts of East China have successively issued and formulated work instructions and plans for building water conservancy projects to gradually reduce water disasters. The Lunan Administrative Office issued instructions on water conservancy construction and afforestation work on the 12th of this month. Based on the waterlogging and drought conditions that occurred in the area this year, it proposed that the future water management policy should focus on both upstream and downstream areas, and both flood discharge and flood control should be emphasized. Afforestation should be carried out upstream to dam mountain gullies and construct flood control reservoirs to conserve water sources. Downstream, rivers should be dredged, canals should be opened, and dikes should be built to ensure smooth flood discharge. However, due to the continuous drought disasters in recent years, it is necessary to simultaneously prevent waterlogging and drought, vigorously construct water conservancy projects, and encourage the masses to dig wells and divert river water for irrigation to prevent drought disasters. The Jiaodong Water Conservancy Bureau has determined to actively complete the main flood discharge in the Xihai and Nanhai areas, the drainage of the great basin, and the experimental construction of valley terraces in mountainous areas, in order to gradually achieve the goal of combining flood discharge and flood reduction. The plan specifies that from early October to late November this year, efforts will be made to have the construction workers dredge the lower reaches of the Wei River, the lower reaches of the Bailang River, the lower reaches of the Shuangshan River to dredge and build dikes, the new river channel for the Guanhe Shortcut, dredge the Longwang River, dredge and build dikes on the Ziyang River, and open canals for drainage in the Xin'anwa, Yong'anwa, Jiangshanwa, Fanglingwa, and Zhuchangwa areas. The Wugu River and Wulong River will be measured and designed this winter in preparation for construction next spring. The Bohai Administrative Office also issued a drainage plan for the second half of this year and the first half of next year, determining to increase the digging of 38 main ditches, dredge the lower reaches of the Xuanhui River and the Tuzhu River, and build three sluice gates, totaling approximately 17 million cubic meters of earthwork, requiring approximately 6.26 million labor days. Among them, the larger Xuanhui River project is estimated to require approximately 6.038 million cubic meters of earthwork, requiring 2.017 million labor days. The river is 400 li long. During the drainage this autumn, it was found that the riverbed was too high and the water flow was not smooth, so the river channel needs to be further deepened. The steps for the project are planned to begin with governments at all levels strengthening water conservancy organizations and enhancing project guidance. Immediately start surveying and designing, and after the autumn harvest, concentrate cadres and laborers to start construction.

　　华东各领导机关指示各地　
    兴修水利免除灾害　
    规定今冬明春具体步骤
    【本报讯】华东各地领导机关为兴修水利逐步减轻水患，曾先后发出与订出了兴修水利的工作指示和计划。鲁中南行署在本月十二日发出关于兴修水利与封山造林工作的指示，根据该区今年发生的水旱灾情形，提出了今后治水方针为上下游兼施，排洪与灭洪并重，上游封山造林，闸山沟、修拦洪水库以涵蓄水源，中下游疏河开渠，筑堤打坝，使洪水顺利排出。但由于近年来不断遭受旱灾，又必须防涝与防旱兼顾，大力兴修水利，推动群众打井引河灌田，以防旱灾。胶东水利局分别轻重缓急，决定积极完成西海、南海区主干的排洪和大盆地的排水及试验山区谷坊建筑，以求逐步达到排洪与减洪相结合的方针。计划中确定今年十月上旬至十一月下旬，争取施工者有潍河下游的锡直，白狼河下游疏浚，双山河下游疏浚筑堤，官河捷水路开挖新河道，龙王河疏浚，淄阳河疏浚筑堤，辛安洼、永安洼、姜山洼、坊岭洼、朱长洼的开渠排水等。今冬测量设计准备明春施工者有五沽河、五龙河。渤海行政公署亦发布了今年下半年与明年上半年的排水计划，确定增挖干沟三十八条，疏浚宣惠河、徒驻河下游，并建水闸三座，共约做一千七百万公方土，约用工六百二十六万余个。其中较大的宣惠河工程，计约挖六百零三万八千公方土，需用工二百零一万七千个，该河全长四百华里。在今秋排水中，发现河底太高，水流不畅现象，因此需将河道继续挖深。工程进行步骤，计划首由各级政府充实水利组织机构，加强工程指导，现在立即着手勘测设计，秋收之后，集中干部民工开始动工。
