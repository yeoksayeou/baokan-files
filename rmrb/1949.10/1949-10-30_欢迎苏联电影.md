　　Welcome Soviet Films
　　Lu Dingyi

　　Film is one of the most important art forms. It has the largest audience, and therefore, it should be valued for the construction of a new democratic China.

　　Soviet film art, both in terms of its ideology and artistry, has long surpassed all capitalist countries. However, in the past, under the rule of American imperialism and its running dogs, the Kuomintang reactionaries, it was very difficult for Chinese film audiences to see Soviet films, especially those films that had the most profound educational significance for the working people. The reactionaries forced audiences to watch decadent, vulgar, and low-grade American films. According to statistics, in old China, about 400 films were shown each year, 300 of which were imported from the United States. The reactionaries' policy in the film industry was, under the guise of "leisure," to instill ideological toxins into the Chinese people and to create profits for the imperialists.

　　The great Chinese people, who are building a new country, have no "leisure" to "kill." What we want is to quickly build a new China that is independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, prosperous, and strong. What we want are the experiences of the people's liberation struggle and construction. What we want is education that inspires labor enthusiasm and strengthens confidence in victory. Those decadent, vulgar, and low-grade films that promote imperialism, feudalism, and fascism will all one day be swept away! In the new China, there is no place for them because the people do not need them!

　　In order to squeeze out those bad films, and at the same time provide sufficient films, we are very eager for domestic and foreign films that serve the people. Thanks to the efforts of progressive filmmakers, our country has begun to produce such films, but the quantity is too small and is not yet sufficient to meet the needs of our great nation. Only socialist Soviet Union can provide us with a large amount of such excellent cultural nourishment. With the help of the Soviet Union, the revolution of China's film industry and the construction of a new people's film industry can be accelerated.

　　Let us open our arms and welcome the large-scale arrival of Soviet films!

　　Please, our artists, widely introduce Soviet films to the people!

　　It is hoped that more Soviet films will be dubbed in Chinese, and that this task will be regarded as one of the most important tasks of our film production industry. Because only in this way can Soviet films be accepted and understood by a wider audience.

　　It is hoped that Soviet films will be shown in large numbers to the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and also widely shown in all cities. Let more and more people be able to enjoy the most progressive Soviet film art.

　　欢迎苏联电影
    陆定一
    电影，这是最重要的艺术部门之一，它的群众性最大，因而，为了建设新民主主义的新中国，它应该受到重视。
    苏联的电影艺术，不论在思想性方面或在艺术性方面，都是老早超过一切资本主义国家的。可是，在过去，在美国帝国主义及其走狗国民党反动派的统治下，我国的电影观众很难得看到苏联电影，尤其是对于劳动人民具有最深刻教育意义的那些影片，更是无法看到。反动派强迫观众去看那堕落的、下流的、低级的美国影片。据统计，在旧中国，每年放映的影片约达四百部，其中三百部是美国进口的。反动派在电影事业方面的政策，是在“消闲”的借口之下，给中国人民灌输思想的毒素，并给帝国主义者制造利润。
    正在建设新国家的伟大的中国人民，没有什么“闲”要“消”。我们要的是迅速建设独立、民主、和平、统一、富强的新中国，我们要的是人民大众解放斗争和建设的经验，我们要的是鼓舞劳动热情和加强胜利信心的教育。那些堕落的、下流的、低级的宣传帝国主义、封建主义和法西斯主义的影片，总有一天要统统滚蛋的！在新中国里，没有它们的地位，因为人民不需要它们！
    为了挤掉那些坏影片，同时又要供给充分的影片，我们对于为人民服务的本国的和外国的影片，是十分渴望的。这类影片，由于进步的电影工作者的努力，我国已开始生产，但数量太少，现在还不足以应我们伟大民族的需要。世界上只有社会主义的苏联，能彀大量供给我们这种优良的文化食粮。有了苏联的帮助，我国电影事业的革命，新的人民电影事业的建设，可以加快速度。
    让我们伸开两臂，欢迎苏联影片的大量到来！
    请我们的艺术家们广泛地向人民介绍苏联的电影！
    希望多多生产用华语配音的苏联影片，并把这个任务作为我国电影制片事业的最重要的任务之一。因为只有这样，苏联影片才能为更广大的观众所接受，所了解。
    希望将苏联影片大量的到工农兵群众中去放映，同时也在一切城市中普遍放映。让更多更多的人能够享受最进步的苏联电影艺术。
    一九四九年十月二十日
