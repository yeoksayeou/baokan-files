　　[This Municipality News] Yesterday (10th) at 5 PM, the 70th Ordnance Factory invited Zhao Zhankui, a worker representative attending the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), to give a speech. Approximately 1,500 employees from the factory and the First Machine Tool Plant attended. After Guo Maolin of the factory's trade union gave a welcoming speech, Zhao Zhankui began his lecture. He said, "We workers were especially happy to see Chairman Mao at the CPPCC conference. The scene of this meeting was magnificent; it's the greatest event in China's history for thousands of years. In the past, no one looked up to workers, only under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party can we workers participate in this meeting." He then said, "Today, workers are masters. We should proactively unite with staff and technicians to build the country together, learn from each other, research together, and improve production. In the past, the Kuomintang separated us; now Chairman Mao tells us to unite!" Finally, he encouraged everyone to improve the mentor-apprentice relationship. Masters should teach their apprentices more; this is serving the people. He also called on Chinese workers to learn from the Soviet Union, our big brother, for construction experience. He said, "We must work hard, research more, create more, and build a new China!" During Zhao Zhankui's speech, the audience applauded thunderously and shouted, "Learn from Comrade Zhao Zhankui!" "Comrade Zhao Zhankui is the banner of the Chinese working class!"
