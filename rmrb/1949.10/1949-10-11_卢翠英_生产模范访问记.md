　　A Visit with a Production Model

　　Lu Cuiying lives in Zhoukou Village, Fangshan County. When she was little, she was born into a poor family that didn't own a single room or a single plot of land. As luck would have it, she had no brothers or younger siblings, only an older sister and parents in their sixties. With no way to make a living, they had to rent a few acres of land from the Zhou family store and the Chen family landlord. After paying rent and taxes every year, they were left with only coarse chaff. The whole family was poor and helpless, so they married off her older sister early. When Lu Cuiying was twelve, she went to the Zhou family store to carry coal and pick up coal cinders. Her father worked as a day laborer for others day and night, sometimes selling fried cakes and peanuts. Her mother made tofu at home to get through the hard times. Regardless of rain or shine, with the river waist-deep, Lu Cuiying had to go to the other side of the river to carry coal and gather firewood. When she was fourteen, she helped her father with planting and weeding. By the time she was sixteen and went to carry coal, people in the village would laugh at her: "Look at how she looks, such a big girl still showing her face in public...". But what could she do if she didn't carry coal? She couldn't get a full meal after working all day. She endured such years for over a decade.

　　On November 13th last year, Fangshan City was liberated. People were jumping and cheering with joy, especially the poor people who felt like they had seen the sun after a long rain. They were all discussing, "Now we can turn over a new leaf!" Lu Cuiying was so happy that she didn't know what to say, thinking, "Now I've finally made it through!". Just in time, the district was opening a training class, and when she heard about it, she immediately asked to be trained. At this time, bad people in the village spread rumors saying, "The Communist Party shares everything, even wives!". A bad woman named Yang heard that she was going to training and secretly went to her house and said to her mother, "Your Cuiying is a nineteen-year-old girl, how embarrassing to attend meetings, it's better to marry her off early these days, and you'll have peace of mind!". After hearing this, her mother vaguely wanted to arrange a marriage for her.

　　When her mother saw her, she said, "People say that if you go to training, you won't come back! I won't let you go to training...". She immediately interrupted her mother, saying, "The People's Liberation Army is so powerful, it's definitely not like what the bad people say, it's all rumors, I must go." Her mother glared at her fiercely and said, "Go! Don't come back to my house in the future...". Lu Cuiying didn't go due to various obstacles in her family.

　　One day, that woman named Yang came to talk to her mother about marriage again. Lu Cuiying knew that the people's government's marriage policy was autonomous and voluntary, so she ran into the house and said angrily, "What are you doing at my house? I don't need you to take care of my affairs."

　　Later, the work team came to her village and mobilized the masses to carry out land reform. She participated in this movement and went to the village to mobilize women to fight against the feudal landlords. From then on, Lu Cuiying could finally speak up. Later, she was elected as a women's representative and the director of the women's federation in the village. The whole family was allocated eight acres of land and two rooms.

　　After the land reform, Lu Cuiying participated in county training classes and production meetings. After returning, she promoted the idea that labor is glorious to the women. And influenced the whole village with her own model actions. This spring, when no one was delivering manure yet, she carried a large basket of manure and drove a donkey to deliver manure. She herself carried 1300 jin of manure this spring. Under the influence of her publicity and practical actions, fourteen women carried and transported manure at that time.

　　This year the harvest is not good, and Zhoukou Village is a poor village, the masses are very difficult, so she and the women in the village organized a labor exchange group, so that the male laborers could go to carry coal to survive the famine year. In this year's production movement, she worked barefoot like the men, and also transformed eleven landlord families' women to participate in labor.

　　Lu Cuiying's labor exchange group is the most active, most hardworking, and most persistent group in the village. They are not only active in production, but also work hard in learning, bringing notebooks to the fields and learning new characters during breaks. Lu Cuiying's labor exchange group has won the praise of the masses in the village and has been praised by the district.

　　This spring she participated in the sub-district production meeting, wearing brand new clothes from head to toe. She spoke at the meeting about her production plan, saying loudly: This new dress I'm wearing was earned from labor, I will work harder in production in the future, have a good life, and lead the women in the village to produce, so that everyone can become rich and live a good life.

    生产模范访问记
    胡立顺
    卢翠英家住房山县周口村，小时生在一个房无一间地无一垄的穷家里，可真碰巧，偏偏自己上无兄下无弟，只有一个姐姐和六十多岁的老爹娘。生活没法，只好租种着周家店陈家地主几亩地，每年交租纳粮，辛苦一年，只落把粗糠。全家贫困没办法，早早就把姐姐出聘了。卢翠英十二岁上就到周家店去背煤、拾煤渣。爹爹没黑没晌的给人家当短工，有时贩卖点炸饼花生仁。妈妈在家作豆腐，来度着这个穷日子。不管阴天下雨，河水齐腰深，卢翠英也得到河那边去背煤、拾柴火。十四岁上，她就帮助爹种地、锄地。到十六岁上，她去背煤时，村里就有人笑话她；“看象什么样子，这么大姑娘了还出头露面的……”。可是不背有什么法？干一天活来吃不上一顿饱饭，她就在这样的岁月中熬过了十来年。
    去年十一月十三日房山城解放了，人们都是蹦蹦跳跳的高兴，特别是穷苦的人们真象见了晴天一样，都议论纷纷说：“这下子可该翻身了吧！”卢翠英更是高兴得不知道说什么好，心里想：“这下子可算熬出来啦！”正好区里要开训练班，她听到后，马上要求去受训。这时村里坏人造谣说：“共产党是共产共妻呀！”一个姓杨的坏妇女听说她要去爱训，便偷偷到她家与她妈说：“你翠英十九岁的大闺女啦，开会多么难看，这年月不如早点出聘了，你老人家就省心啦！”经她这么一说，她妈便糊里糊涂的要给她订婚。
    妈见了她就说：“人家都说你受训去就回不来啦！我不叫你受训去。……”她马上打断妈的话说：“人民解放军力量这样大，决不是象坏人说的那样，净是谣言，我一定要去。”妈狠狠的瞪了她一眼说：“你去吧！今后不用进我的家……”卢翠英终因家庭的各种阻挠没有去成。
    有一天那个姓杨的妇女又来向她妈谈亲事。卢翠英心里早有数，知道人民政府的婚姻政策是自主自愿，就跑进屋里去气冲冲的说：“你到俺家干什么来啦？我的事用不着你来管。”
    从来工作组到了她村里，发动群众进行土地改革。她参加了这个运动，去村里发动妇女，向封建地主开展斗争。从此卢翠英才算抬起头说话了。后来村里又选她当了妇女代表和妇联会主任。全家分了八亩地两间房。
    土改结束后，卢翠英参加了县训练班和生产会议，回来后即向妇女们宣传劳动光荣的思想。并以自己的模范行动影响全村。今年春天，还没有一家送粪的，她就背着一大筐粪赶着毛驴送粪，光自己今年春天背粪也有一千三百斤。在她的宣传和实际行动的影响下，当时就有十四个妇女背粪驮粪。
    今年年景不好，周口村又是一个穷村，群众很困难，她便和村中妇女组织了拨工组，使男劳力好去背煤来度荒年。在今年的生产运动中，她光着脚与男子一样的干，并改造了十一个地主家庭的妇女也参加了劳动。
    卢翠英的拨工组，是全村最活跃最干活多最坚持得久的一个组。她们不光生产积极，对学习也很努力，下地时也带日记本，在休息时学生字。卢翠英的拨工组得到了全村群众的称赞，并得到了区里的表扬。
    今年春天她参加分区生产会议去，混身上下穿的是崭新的衣裳，在会场上讲她自己的生产计划，响亮的说：我这身新衣服是从劳动中挣来呀，我今后要更努力生产，过好光景，并要领导全村妇女生产，大家都能发家致富，把光景过的好好的。
