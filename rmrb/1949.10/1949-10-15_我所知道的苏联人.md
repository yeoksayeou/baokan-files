What I Know of the Soviets
    Xia Yuan
    I lived in Dalian for a year and eight months, where I saw many Soviets.

    I don't speak a word of Russian, so I can only observe them with my eyes, listen to others talk about them, and try to understand them with my heart. What I saw were kind, amiable, warm, and sincere faces. What I heard were stories of heroism, courage, and self-sacrifice.

    I know a famous worker in Dalian, a boiler expert and model factory director of the Ship Canal Factory, named Wang Zhifu. He suffered for half his life, simply because he couldn't pay the rent and was forced to move more than twenty times. Since the liberation of Lüda, his situation has changed completely. Once, he went to a meeting, and after the meeting, the Soviet supervisor from his factory wanted to visit his home. He led the way, and the Soviet supervisor, seeing that his residence wasn't very good, spent a lot of money the next day running around to find him a building, had it cleaned up, and furnished it with complete tables and chairs. He also sent a car to help him move. Now, Lao Wang lives in that building.

    I also know a friend named Kong Yafei, who is the director of the Shahekou Power Plant in Dalian. This factory is a Sino-Soviet joint venture, and I often went to the factory to chat with Lao Kong. One day, I saw workers taking a technical training class when a Soviet technician rushed into the classroom with a stack of drawings. He looked hurried, searching around, and I guessed he must have an urgent matter to discuss with one of the workers. But when he saw the workers concentrating on studying the technology, he quickly slowed his steps, entered the classroom, and quietly sat in the back row, squinting at the drawings on the blackboard. He examined them for a long time, then suddenly stood up, walked to the blackboard, picked up a piece of chalk, and changed a few lines on the drawing. The Chinese technical worker acting as the instructor immediately nodded, indicating agreement with his modification. Then he returned to his original seat, watching and listening. He waited until the workers finished their class before approaching an elderly worker named Qi Fuxiang, who was over sixty years old, and closely discussed the work with him.

    I also have a friend named Fan Shijie. Once, after the autumn harvest, his crops were piled up in the yard, and the house was full of firewood. His mother was cooking in the house, and the fire from the stove spread, burning the walls and reaching the roof. By the time they discovered the danger, the red flames had already licked through the thatched roof, and black smoke billowed upwards. All the neighbors rushed over, but no one dared to step forward. A Soviet Red Army officer and seven soldiers stationed in the village heard the commotion and rushed over. Without hesitation, some went onto the roof, others fetched water. The officer burned his right hand, and one soldier's clothes caught fire. His face was also cut, and blood streamed down. With their wisdom and courage, and fierce struggle against the raging fire, they finally conquered the terrible fire, minimizing the losses for the Lao Fan family. Afterwards, Lao Fan's father bought wine and meat, insisting on inviting the Soviet Red Army soldiers as guests, but the Soviet soldiers refused to go no matter what.

    If you have the opportunity to go to the factories in Lüda, especially the Sino-Soviet joint ventures, and ask our worker brothers and sisters: What are the Soviet factory directors, Soviet technicians, and all the Soviet staff like? They will immediately talk about them with great praise, giving many vivid examples: when a female worker at the canning factory fell ill, the Soviet factory director took her to the hospital by car; when dockworkers wanted to learn technology, the dock chief personally installed a large electric light; ... In all the villages, Soviet soldiers helped with sowing, harvesting, delivering manure, and transporting grain.

    In the fishing villages on the coastline, hungry people who hadn't had enough to eat for decades now have smiles and songs. Poor children are all carrying schoolbags and going to school happily. Those under forty-five who are illiterate are now rare...

    Whenever I stroll along the streets at sunset, I see Soviet women and Chinese women chatting and laughing at the door, as close as family; I see Chinese children and Soviet children playing together happily; I see Soviet technicians and Chinese workers strolling hand in hand...

　　我所知道的苏联人
    夏园
    我在大连住了一年零八个月，在那里，我看见了不少的苏联人。
    我是连一句俄国话也不会的人，只能够用眼睛看他们，用耳朵去听别人讲说他们，用心去揣摩他们，我所看见的，都是和蔼、亲切、热烈、诚恳的面孔，我所听到的都是英勇、果敢自我牺牲的故事。
    我在大连认识一个在旅大有名的工人，他是锅炉健将，又是船渠工厂模范厂长，他的名字叫王智富。受了半辈子的活罪，单是因为缴不上房租，就被赶着搬了二十多回家。自从旅大解放以后，他的光景可就不同了，有一回他去开会，散会以后，他们工厂的苏联监督官要到他家串门，他就领着去了，苏联监督官一看他的住宅不大好，便在第二天东跑西奔给他找妥一座楼房，化了不少的钱给他收拾干净，桌椅板凳，无不齐全，又派汽车帮他搬家，现在老王便住在那座楼房里。
    我还认识一个在大连沙河口发电厂当厂长的朋友孔亚非，这个工厂，属于中苏合办，我常到那个工厂找老孔闲扯。有一天，我看见工友正在上课学习技术的时候，有个苏联技师手里拿着一堆图样跑进教室。他现出急急忙忙的样子，目光向各处搜寻，我猜他一定是要找那个工友有急事商量。可是当他看见了工友们正在聚精会神的研究技术时，就赶紧放轻脚步，走进教室，在最后排的空位上悄悄的坐下，眯着眼睛望着黑板上画的图样。他端详了半天，忽然立起，跑到黑板前面，拿起粉笔，把那图样改了几道线条。当教员的中国技术工友马上点头，表示同意他的修正。于是他重回原处，看着，听着。一直等到工友们下了课，他才过去扶着一个六十多岁的老工友名叫齐福祥的肩膀，亲密地商量工作。
    我还有个朋友名叫范世杰，一次，他的家在秋收以后，庄稼堆在院里，满屋都是柴草，他的母亲在屋里做饭，灶里的火爬了出来，烧着了墙壁，漫延到了屋顶。等他们发现了这个危险，赤红的火舌已经舐透草的房盖，黑烟呼呼上腾。邻居全都赶来，可是谁也不敢上前。驻在该村的苏联红军一个军官，七个士兵，闻声赶到，他们不管三七二十一，上房的上房，打水的打水。军官烧伤了右手，一个士兵衣服都烧起了火，脸也破了，鲜血直流。凭着他们的智慧和勇敢，和激烈的猛火苦斗，终于征服了这场可怕的火灾，使老范一家，损失不大。事后老范的父亲打了酒，买了肉，一定要请那几位苏联红军的客，可是那几位苏联战士，无论如何也不肯去。
    假设你有机会能到旅大的工厂特别是中苏合办的工厂里去问问我们那些工人弟兄姐妹：苏联厂长，苏联技师和一切苏联工作人员怎样？他们马上就会异常赞美的谈起来，说出很多很多生动的例子：制罐工厂的女工病了，苏联厂长用汽车把他送到医院，码头工人要学技术，码头长亲自给按装大个电灯；…………在一切乡村，苏联军人帮助播种、收割、送粪、运粮。
    在海岸线上的渔村，几十年来没有吃过饱饭的饥饿人民如今有了笑颜，有了歌声，穷人的孩子们都背起书包嘻嘻哈哈的上学，四十五岁以下的市民，不识字的已经稀少了………。
    当我每在日落黄昏，顺着街边散步时，看见苏联妇女和中国妇女亲如家人，比比划划的在门口谈笑；看见中国儿童和苏联儿童多么快活的在一起玩耍，看见苏联技师和中国工友拉手闲游……。
