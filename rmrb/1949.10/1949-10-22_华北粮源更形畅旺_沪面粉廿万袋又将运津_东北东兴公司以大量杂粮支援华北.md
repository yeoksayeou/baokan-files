　　North China Grain Supply Further Strengthened
　　Shanghai Flour, 200,000 Bags, Will Again Be Shipped to Tianjin
　　Northeast Dongxing Company Supports North China with Large Quantities of Coarse Grains
　　[Reported by This Newspaper] The 200,000 bags of Shanghai flour ordered by the North China Grain Company were shipped to Tianjin in batches before the 20th of this month. Now, the company has signed an agreement with the Shanghai Grain Company, stipulating that it will guarantee the shipment of another 200,000 bags of flour from Shanghai to Tianjin within the three months from October to December. The quality of this batch of flour is equivalent to two-thirds of Tianjin's Lizi Brand flour and one-third of Hengzi Brand flour. The flour price is flexibly determined according to Tianjin's wholesale price. If the price of Shanghai flour is lower or higher than the Tianjin price, it will be calculated based on the actual cost, and the profits and losses will be shared by both parties. Transportation is the responsibility of Shanghai, while the North China Grain Company is responsible for handling various procedures after the flour arrives in Tianjin. According to representatives from the Shanghai Grain Company, in addition to what is stipulated in the agreement, Shanghai flour will be shipped to Tianjin in large quantities in the future to supply North China.
　　[Further Report] In order to fully supply the grain needs of the North China region, the North China Grain Company previously agreed with the Northeast State-owned Dongxing Company to transfer a large batch of grain from the Northeast to the customs area, planning to transfer 50 million jin of various coarse grains to supply North China in October. In the first week of the month alone, more than 5 million jin of corn, sorghum, millet, and foxtail millet were shipped to Tianjin.
　　Furthermore, after receiving instructions from the Northeast Commercial Bureau to exchange grain for cloth and cash, Dongxing Company actively carried out exchanges in the four provinces of Longjiang, Songjiang, Jilin, and Liaoxi. According to preliminary statistics, in the first ten days of this month (ending on the 13th in Jilin), 25,261 tons of various grains have been purchased. In this purchase, the price ratio of grain to cloth has been quickly and reasonably adjusted, and farmers have not only exchanged grain for high-quality and low-priced cloth but also increased their purchasing power for the means of production and daily life.

　　华北粮源更形畅旺
  　沪面粉廿万袋又将运津
    东北东兴公司以大量杂粮支援华北
    【本报讯】华北粮食公司订购之上海面粉二十万袋，已于二十日前先后运抵津市，现该公司又与上海粮食公司签订协议，规定十月至十二月三个月内，保证再由沪运津面粉二十万袋。该批面粉质量相当天津利字通粉者三分之二，恒字通粉者三分之一。面价按津市批发价灵活规定，如上海面粉较津价低或高时，均依实际成本计算，其盈亏部分由双方分扣。运输由上海负责，到津市后各种手续的办理则由华北粮食公司负责。据上海粮食公司代表谈称：除协议规定者外，今后上海面粉将大量运津，供给华北。
    【又讯】华北粮食公司为充分供应华北区粮食需要，前曾与东北国营东兴公司协议由东北调运大批粮食入关，计划在十月份内调运各项杂粮五千万斤供应华北。仅月初一周中已运津玉米、高粱、谷子、小米等五百余万斤。
    又东兴公司接到东北商业局以布匹现款等换购粮食的指示后，即积极在龙江、松江、吉林、辽西四省进行换购。据初步统计本月上旬（吉林截十三日止）中，已购到各种粮食二万五千二百六十一吨，在此次收购中，并使得粮布的比价迅速得到合理调整，农民不仅以粮食换取了物美价廉的布匹，而且也提高了生产生活资料的购买力。
