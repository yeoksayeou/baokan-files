　　I Learned Teaching Methods
　　织流
　　I had been a technical instructor in the Liberated Area for more than three years. At first, the students in my class were of senior high school to university level; my method was the old one, the teaching materials were also copied from old textbooks. I prepared very thoroughly before class, so there would be no mistakes in the classroom. The students didn't have any complaints about my class, and of course I was very satisfied. But during the summary, the Education Director made two suggestions to me: first, the content of the course was not good enough, some materials would not be used later, and the need for "crash courses" was not considered; second, the arrangement and examples were old-fashioned and did not conform to the new principles. At that time, I certainly could not accept these opinions. I thought the students felt I was good, but you criticized my work as having no merit. After thinking about it, I could only come to one conclusion: the Education Director didn't understand the situation and was shooting randomly; he was irresponsible and didn't care for his subordinates.

　　But when I taught a group of elementary school students from the countryside, I began to feel that my teaching method was not working: I lectured to the students, I thought I was very patient, and I explained things very clearly and simply, but the students just didn't understand. What could I do? I started thinking again, and I came up with a result: my teaching method was still right, the students couldn't understand it, only because they were too stupid. But the students were very serious and gave me many specific suggestions. Such as not to make long speeches, so that everyone can't grasp the center, etc. At that time, I was very skeptical of their opinions, and felt even more headache, thinking that only students can learn from teachers, and teachers can never be assimilated by students. Therefore, I had another reason, regardless of the students' opinions, regardless of the Education Director's advice, I continued my own way, it didn't matter if the students didn't understand, my class was still like a wound-up music box, just going on.

　　But an unexpected thing happened, it woke me up, and made me understand the irresponsibility of the past and the seriousness of being divorced from reality. The reason why there were no opinions when I taught the first class of students was because many of the students in this class were as ambitious and impractical as I was, only wanting more, without asking whether they understood deeply or whether it was applicable.

　　This unexpected thing happened like this: there was a student named Zhao Man, who was originally an elementary school teacher and understood the psychology and understanding methods of elementary school students. Once, when I had explained a problem several times, but everyone still didn't understand, I was sweating profusely; at this time, he helped me out. He raised his hand and said to me politely and confidently: "Teacher Huang, I understand, let me try to explain it to everyone, can they understand it clearly?" I had to reluctantly agree. But he only took a few minutes to explain the problem clearly. He said it much simpler than I did, but it was thorough and vivid, without any far-fetchedness, making me feel new and easy to understand. After class, the students surrounded me and said: "Teacher Huang, Zhao Man's method is right, easy to understand, I hope you will also teach like this in the future." I just smiled and nodded, I had to make up my mind to learn, to learn from my students.

　　From this time on, I no longer put on airs, talked with the students, solicited their opinions, understood their thoughts, learned their vocabulary, paid attention to their methods of explaining problems, and closely integrated with them in life, and at the same time learned about farm tools, labor and customs from the villagers. In this way, my words and actions slowly became consistent with theirs. In the classroom, I used their vocabulary and narrative methods, and used things they often saw as examples as much as possible. For example, to explain the problem of two rotations at the same time, I used pushing a millstone instead of flywheels and belts; when talking about power, I used a hundred li and a hundred jin instead of horsepower, trains and airplanes, etc. In this way, not only did they understand, but they also found it very interesting.

　　From then on, there were fewer opinions, and they were more satisfied. When I taught another new group of students, there were very few opinions. At this time, I realized that the Education Director's opinion was correct, and I was wrong.

　　我学会了教学法
    织流
    我在解放区当了三年多技术教员了。起先，我教的一班学生，是高中至大学程度的；方法是用过去旧的一套，教材也是从旧教本中搬过来，课前准备得很熟练，在讲堂上是不会出岔子的。学员们对我的课并没有什么意见，我当然也很满意。但总结的时候，教育长对我提出两个意见：第一，课程的内容不够好，有些材料以后用不上的，也没有注意到“速成”的需要；第二，编排和例证都是陈旧的一套，不合乎新原则。当时，我对这种意见，当然不能接受。我以为学员还感觉我不错，你却把我的工作批评到毫无可取。我想来想去，我只能得到这样一个结论：教育长不了解情况，乱开炮；对工作不负责任，不爱护下级。
    但当我再教一群农村里来的高小学生时，我开始感觉自己的教学法不灵了：向学员们讲课，我自己认为很耐心，讲得很有层次，又很浅近，可是学员们就是不懂。那有啥办法呢？我又开始想了，而且又想出结果：自己的教学法还是对，学员们听不懂，只怪他们太笨。但学员们却挺认真，向我提出许多具体的意见。如不要长篇大论，使大家捉不着中心等等，当时，我对他们的意见很怀疑，而更感觉头痛，认为只能学生跟教员学，教员绝对不能被学员所同化。因此我又有理由了，不管同学的意见，不管教育长的劝导，我继续我的一套，学员听不懂没关系，我上课仍象上足了弦的戏盒子一样，只管往下开。
    但意外的事情发生了，它使我醒觉过来了，使我明白过去不负责任的态度，和脱离实际的严重性。我教第一班学生时所以没有意见，就是因为这班中的许多学生，也是和我一样好高鹜远，只要多，不问是否深解、适用。
    这件意外的事情是这样经过的，有一位学员叫赵满的，他原先是一位小学教员，懂得小学生的心理和理解方法。有一次，当我把一个问题讲了好几遍，而大家还听不明白的时候，我急得满身大汗；这时，他给我解围了。他举起手，客气而自信地向我说：“黄教员，我听明白了，你让我试试跟大家讲一遍，是不是能够听得清？”我只好勉强答应了。可是他只需几分钟便把问题解释清了。他说得比我简单多了，但周到而生动，没有半点牵强，令我也听得入耳，感觉新颖。课后学员们围拢我说：“黄教员，赵满的办法对劲，容易懂，希望你以后也这样讲。”我只是微笑点头，我得下决心学习了，向我的学员学习。
    由这时候起，我便不再摆架子，和学员们拉话，征求他们的意见，了解他们的思想，学习他们的语汇，注意他们讲述问题的方法，生活上和他们紧密地联成一片，同时向老乡了解农具、劳作和风俗习惯。这样，我和他们的言语和行动慢慢一致起来了。在讲堂上，我使用他们的语汇和叙述方法，举例尽量用他们常见的东西。比方解释两种转动同时进行的问题，我便用推碾子代替了飞轮和皮带；讲功率时，我用百里百斤代替了马力、火车和飞机等，这样，不但他们听明白，而且很够味。
    从这以后，意见少了，他们也比较满意了。我再教另一批新学员时，便很少意见。这时我才明白了教育长的意见是正确的，我是错误的。
