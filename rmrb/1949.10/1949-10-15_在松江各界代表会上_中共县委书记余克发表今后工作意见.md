Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 14th: At the Songjiang County People's Representatives Conference held on September 30th, Yu Ke, Secretary of the Songjiang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, announced the opinions of the CCP Songjiang County Committee regarding the future work guidelines and tasks of Songjiang County. He first pointed out: "It has been more than four months since the liberation of Songjiang County. Before liberation, the reactionaries had planned and left behind a large number of remnant bandits and secret agents to carry out sabotage. After four months of suppression and pacification, the bandits have been largely eliminated, and social order has been basically stabilized. The broad masses of peasants have begun to stand up and become masters, recounting their grievances and establishing their own organizations. During the summer tax collection, preliminary, reasonable, and legal struggles were carried out against the despotic landlords who oppressed the people and shifted the burden. The People's Government has also paid attention from the beginning to maintaining and restoring production, stabilizing finance, and combating speculation. After the typhoon disaster, it also made every effort to lead the people in disaster relief and flood prevention, so that the people's economic life, which was on the verge of collapse and bankruptcy before liberation, began to gain hope of regeneration." Yu Ke then explained: "This is only a good start. Moreover, there are still some shortcomings and mistakes in our past work that need to be corrected urgently. In particular, the situation facing us is still very serious. On the one hand, the Kuomintang reactionaries are still making a dying struggle, blockading and harassing us, and instructing the remaining bandits and secret agents within the territory to carry out various forms of decentralized and hidden sabotage activities. On the other hand, the feudal forces' control in the countryside has basically not changed. Despotic landlords collude with bandits and secret agents to control the Baojia regime, refusing to save disaster victims and continuing to exploit farmers with heavy rents and high interest rates. If this situation is not overcome and changed, rural production and urban industry and commerce cannot be effectively restored and developed." After analyzing the current situation in Songjiang, Yu Ke further pointed out: "The policy of our Party in building Songjiang is to transform the old Songjiang into a new Songjiang, and to transform Songjiang, a consuming city, into a producing city. In order to achieve this goal, we must resolutely implement the work policy of focusing on the countryside while taking into account the cities in the next few years." Speaking here, he further called on all the people of Songjiang to unite and resolutely implement the following six major tasks: (1) Make every effort to eliminate bandits, eradicate secret agents, and consolidate revolutionary order. Resolutely implement the policy of political offensive as the main approach, combined with military suppression, and adhere to the correct policy of "punishing the ringleaders, not questioning the followers, and rewarding those who make contributions." (2) Implement a reasonable burden, complete the autumn tax collection and reorganize urban tax revenue tasks, to ensure the needs of the liberation war and national construction. We must oppose the illegal acts of landlords and despots who conceal land and shift burdens. We must take into account the people's production, life, and ability to bear burdens, and adhere to the principle of reasonable burden. (3) Vigorously carry out production and disaster relief, and do our best to maintain, restore and develop urban production. We must solve the living difficulties of some famine victims in the autumn famine, and try to reduce the difficulties caused by the autumn harvest shortfall in the coming winter and spring. We must develop state-owned enterprises, protect all private industrial and commercial enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and adhere to the policy of "developing production, prospering the economy, taking into account both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital." (4) Implement rent and interest reduction, initially improve the lives of farmers, and actively prepare conditions for land reform. (5) Abolish the Baojia system, transform the grassroots government, hold people's representatives conferences of all sectors regularly, promote democracy, and overcome bureaucratic work styles. (6) Dredge major rivers, organize and establish marketing and supply cooperatives with emphasis, and improve urban-rural relations.
    Yu Ke said at the end of his report: "I hope that all representatives will criticize and correct this proposal. We communists will follow Chairman Mao's exhortations, and work with people from all walks of life outside the Party in a close and open cooperation with a democratic, humble, and modest attitude, and strive together to build a new Songjiang."

　　在松江各界代表会上
  　中共县委书记余克发表今后工作意见
    【新华社上海十四日电】中共松江县委会书记余克在九月三十日召开的松江县各界人民代表会上发表了中共松江县委会对于松江县今后工作方针与任务的意见。他首先指出：“松江县的解放，已经四个多月了。在解放前，反动派曾有计划地布置，留下大量残余土匪和特务分子，进行捣乱。经过了我们四个月来的清剿招抚，股匪已大体被肃清，社会治安已达到基本上的稳定；广大农民已开始翻身作主，诉说自己的冤苦，建立自己的组织，夏征中并对压迫人民转嫁负担的恶霸地主进行了初步合理合法的斗争。人民政府并从一开始就注意维持恢复生产，稳定金融，打击投机。台灾发生后，又全力领导人民救灾防泛，使解放前已濒于凋敝破产的人民经济生活，开始获得更生的希望。”余克接着说明：“这还仅仅是一个良好的开始。而且在我们过去工作中还存在若干的缺点和错误，亟待改正。特别是摆在我们面前的情况，还是十分严重的。一方面，国民党反动派还在作垂死的挣扎，对我们进行封锁、骚扰，指使境内残余土匪和特务分子作分散隐蔽的种种破坏活动。另方面，农村中封建势力的统治情况还基本上没有改变，恶霸地主勾结土匪特务控制保甲政权，对灾民见死不救，对农民仍进行重租高利的剥削。如果此种情况不加克服和改变，则农村生产及城市工商业便无法作有效的恢复和发展。”余克在分析当前松江的情况后，进一步指出：“我党建设松江的方针就是要变旧松江为新松江，变松江这个消费的城市为生产的城市。为要达到这一目标，必须在今后数年内坚决执行以农村为重点同时兼顾城市的工作方针。”讲到这里，他进一步号召松江全体人民一致团结起来，坚决实行下列六大任务：（一）全力剿灭土匪，肃清特务，巩固革命秩序。坚决实行以政治攻势为主，结合军事清剿的方针，坚持“首恶者必办、协从者不问、立功者受奖”的正确政策。（二）实行合理负担，完成秋征与整理城市税收任务，以保证解放战争与国家建设事业的需要。要反对地主恶霸隐报土地和转嫁负担的不法行为。要照顾人民生产、生活及负担能力，坚持合理负担的原则。（三）大力进行生产救灾，并尽力维持恢复与发展城市生产。要解决秋荒中部分荒民的生活困难，并设法减少由于秋季歉收而造成的今冬明春的困难。要发展公营企业，保护一切有利国计民生的私营工商业，必须坚持“发展生产、繁荣经济、公私兼顾、劳资两利”的方针。（四）实行减租减息，初步改善农民生活，积极为土地改革准备条件。（五）废除保甲制度，改造基层政权，经常举行各界人民代表会议，发扬民主，克服官僚主义作风。（六）疏浚主要河道，整理与有重点的建立运销合作社，改善城乡关系。
    余克在结束他的报告时说：“这一建议，希望各代表批评指正。我们共产党人将遵照毛主席的告诫，以民主、虚心、谦逊的态度，来与党外各界人民进行亲密的、开诚布公的合作，共同为建设新松江而奋斗。”
