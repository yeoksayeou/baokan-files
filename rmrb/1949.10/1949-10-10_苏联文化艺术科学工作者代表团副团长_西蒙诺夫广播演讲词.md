　　Broadcast Speech by Simonov, Deputy Head of the Soviet Cultural, Artistic, and Scientific Workers Delegation

　　On the evening of October 8th, Simonov, Deputy Head of the Soviet Cultural, Artistic, and Scientific Workers Delegation, accepted an invitation to deliver a broadcast speech to the Chinese people on the Beijing Xinhua Broadcasting Station. The full text of the broadcast speech is as follows:

　　Dear friends of the free, united, and people's democratic New China, dear comrades radio listeners, on behalf of the Soviet cultural delegation, which has come to Beijing, the capital of free China, to participate in the Chinese Congress for the Defense of World Peace and the inaugural meeting of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, I extend to you friendly and fraternal heartfelt respects.

　　Our delegation has come here to consolidate and develop the great friendship between our two great nations. It represents millions of Soviet cultural workers, scholars, writers, actors, engineers, teachers, and doctors, representing the broadest strata of advanced Soviet intellectuals, to pay tribute to you.

　　Almost twenty-five years ago, Sun Yat-sen, the great activist of China, in his famous letter to the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union, prophetically wrote: "Dear comrades, as I bid you farewell, I wish to express my ardent hope that the dawn is about to break, at which time the Soviet Union will welcome a strong and independent China as a good friend and ally, and the two countries will join hands in the great battle for the freedom of the world's oppressed nations to achieve victory."

　　This prophetic vision has been realized. Its realization is due to the selfless struggle of the Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army over the years against the Japanese aggressors, the American imperialists, and the enemies of the people—the Kuomintang reactionaries.

　　Now that day has arrived, and we Soviets congratulate our friends and allies in a strong and free China, fighting for a bright future for all mankind.

　　It is a great honor for our Soviet delegation to come to China during the days of celebrating the great struggle and great victory of the Chinese people, and during the days of the establishment of the Government Council of the People's Republic of China.

　　We were honored to spend the great national holiday of the Chinese people in Beijing on October 1st. We had the opportunity to hear Comrade Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people, read the historically significant declaration of the establishment of the Central People's Government.

　　We witnessed the grand review of the combat troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, a force that has gained supreme glory in the difficult days of the Long March, in the days of relentless struggle with the Japanese bandits, and in the victorious days of destroying and capturing the reactionary Kuomintang troops. We saw the defenders of the freedom and independence of the Chinese people, riding in tanks and armored vehicles, equipped with automatic rifles and machine guns, possessing artillery and air force.

　　The army that passed before our eyes not only destroyed the Chinese reactionaries but also inflicted a cruel defeat on American imperialism. We saw American-made automatic rifles, mortars, machine guns, and cannons, which the American warmongers had sent here to eliminate the People's Liberation Army and strangle the Chinese people. These were captured by the Chinese People's Liberation Army in battle and turned into weapons against all enemies of the Chinese people in the hands of the Liberation Army.

　　We saw extremely grand demonstrations, with hundreds of thousands of Beijing citizens participating. There were also similarly grand mass rallies in Tianjin. We saw the triumph of the victorious people, and we Soviets deeply understand that superior feeling of being honored and proud of one's victory. This victory was achieved by the Chinese people after such a long and difficult road. We Soviet representatives came to participate in the Chinese Congress for the Defense of World Peace at the most exciting moment when Comrade Zhu De, Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, took the podium. Before he began his speech, he announced that the great Soviet Union was the first in the world to recognize the New China and establish diplomatic relations with the government of the People's Democratic China.

　　The whole audience erupted in thunderous applause. Our Chinese friends, as well as we Soviets, friends of China, joyfully participated in this cheer. At this historically significant moment, we felt proud to be able to represent all Soviet people and shake hands with Chinese comrades and extend our heartfelt congratulations.

　　Our Soviet delegation participated in the Chinese Congress for the Defense of World Peace and also participated in the inaugural meeting of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. We feel that these are very important and grand events. The issue of peace among nations and the issue of friendship with the Soviet Union, the country leading the peace camp, are closely related. Friends of the Soviet Union are forever supporters of world peace; and on the other hand, supporters of world peace are friends of the Soviet Union, friends of its thorough and unwavering peace policy among nations. Conversely, those who declare themselves enemies of the Soviet Union, and governments, are in fact always overt or covert instigators of new wars, and therefore enemies of all nations, including their own.

　　Lu Xun, one of the most progressive and talented people of China, wrote in his article seventeen years ago: "Besides its lackeys, what interests of imperialism are not directly opposed to ours? Our carbuncles are their treasures, so, of course, their enemies are our friends. They themselves are collapsing and cannot support themselves. In order to save their last days, they hate the Soviet Union's progress. Rumors, curses, resentments, nothing is spared, but to no avail. Finally, they have to prepare to strike. They must destroy it before they can sleep. But what do we do? Will we be deceived again?" (This passage is from Lu Xun's "We Will No Longer Be Deceived")

　　Yes, the people of China and the people of the Soviet Union are friends. And the common enemy of our two nations is the imperialists. If these imperialists have been hypocritically hating the Soviet Union for thirty-two years, then undoubtedly, now, after the establishment of the People's Republic of China, they will also violently oppose this republic, this republic's government, which has declared the principles of people's democracy, equality among nations, and peace among nations.

　　Yes, it should be considered that the fury of our common enemy, the warmongers, cannot frighten the great Chinese people, just as it has not been able to frighten the Soviet people led by the great Lenin and the great Stalin for thirty-two years.

　　Our two great nations will despise the vicious conspiracies of our common enemy, the enemies of peace. Our two great nations will quietly engage in consolidating our friendship in all areas of life and culture. We Soviets are deeply concerned about how to enable the broad strata of the Soviet Union to more fully and deeply understand the great ancient culture of the Chinese people, to understand the history of their heroic liberation struggle, to understand their modern achievements in all areas of life, and to understand their modern culture and art.

　　We make a promise to our Chinese comrades that after we return to the Soviet Union, we will do everything in our power to make our Soviet readers and radio listeners aware of all the achievements of the People's Democratic China. During our visit to China, we have personally witnessed these achievements, and at the same time, the broad strata of Soviet society will be greatly interested in these achievements. We, the activists of Soviet culture, are also very happy to introduce to the broad strata of advanced Chinese society the various achievements we have made in the fields of culture, literature, art, and national education in our great country, which is building a new communist society.

　　Dear comrades, radio listeners, my brief speech is coming to an end. Let me, on behalf of Soviet cultural workers, once again extend to you the warmest and most friendly respects, and wish you all success in the great construction of the People's Democratic China, and wish you success in your work in the countryside, in factories, in institutions, in schools, in universities, and in the army.

　　Long live the consolidated, unbreakable, and eternal friendship of the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union with great traditions!

　　Long live our great friendship, which no force in the world can destroy or shake!

　　苏联文化艺术科学工作者代表团副团长
    西蒙诺夫广播演讲词
    苏联文化艺术科学工作者代表团副团长西蒙诺夫十月八日晚应邀在北京新华广播电台向中国人民发表广播演说，广播词全文如下：
    自由、统一、人民民主新中国的亲爱的朋友们，亲爱的无线电听众同志们，我代表来到自由中国的首都——北京，参加中国保卫世界和平大会以及中苏友好协会成立大会的苏联文化界代表团，向你们致友好的、兄弟的衷心敬意。
    我们来到这里的代表团，是为了巩固和发展我们两大民族伟大的友谊的。它代表千百万苏联文化工作者，代表学者和作家演员和工程师、教师和医生，代表先进的苏维埃知识分子最广泛的阶层，向你们致敬意。
    差不多二十五年以前，中国伟大的活动家孙中山，在他给苏联中央执行委员会的著名的信里，预言地写道：“亲爱的同志，当此与你们决别之际，我愿表示我热烈的希望，希望不久即将破晓，斯时苏联以良友及盟国而欢迎强盛独立之中国，两国在争世界被压迫民族自由之大战中，携手并进以取得胜利。”
    这种预言式的预见是实现了。它的实现，是由于中国人民及人民解放军，多年来进行了反对日本侵略者，美国帝国主义者，反对人民的敌人——国民党反动派的奋不顾身的斗争。
    现在这个日子已经来到了，我们苏联人，在强大的自由的中国祝贺自己的朋友和同盟者，为了争取全人类美满的未来而斗争。
    我们在举行庆祝中国人民伟大斗争和伟大胜利的盛典的日子里，在中华人民共和国政府委员会成立的日子里来到中国，这对我们苏联代表团，是莫大的荣幸。
    我们很荣幸地能够在十月一号在北京来渡过中华全国人民伟大的节日。我们有机会听到中华人民的领袖毛泽东同志宣读中央人民政府成立的有历史意义的宣言。
    我们亲眼看到中国人民解放军战斗部队的盛大的检阅，这个部队在长征的困难日子里，在与日本强盗进行无情的斗争的日子里，在摧毁及俘掳反动的国民党军队的胜利日子里获得了无上的光荣。我们看到中国人民自由与独立的保卫者，他们乘着坦克车和装甲车，配备着自动步枪和机关枪，拥有着炮兵和空军。
    在我们眼前经过的军队，不仅是摧毁了中国反动派的军队，而且也是带给美国帝国主义以残酷失败的军队。我们看到了美国制造的自动枪，迫击炮，机关枪和大炮，这些东西曾由美国的战争煽动者们为着消灭人民解放军和绞杀中国人民而送到这里来的，这些东西在战斗中被中国人民解放军夺取过来，并在解放军手里变为反对中国人民的一切敌人的武器。
    我们看到了极盛大的示威游行，有几十万北京的市民参加，在天津也有过同样盛大的群众大会。我们看到胜利了的人民的凯旋，而我们苏联人，深知为自己的胜利而觉得荣幸和骄矜的那种优越的情感。这种胜利是中国人民经历那么长久和困难的道路才达到的。我们苏维埃的代表们，恰在最激动的时刻来参加中国保卫世界和平大会，那时中国人民解放军总司令朱德同志登上会议的讲坛，在他开始讲演之前，宣布伟大的苏联在全世界上第一个承认新中国并与人民民主中国的政府建立外交关系。
    全场对这一消息欢声雷动，我们的中国朋友以及中国的朋友的我们苏联人，同样欢喜地参加这种欢呼。在这一有历史意义的时刻，我们因为能够代表全体苏联人和中国的同志们握手并致衷心祝贺而感到骄傲。
    我们苏联代表团参加了中国保卫世界和平大会，也参加了中苏友好协会成立大会，我们觉得这是非常重要和盛大的事件。各民族间和平的问题以及与领导和平阵营的国家——苏联的友好问题，是相互密切关联的问题。苏联的朋友——永远是全世界和平的拥护者；而另一方面，全世界和平的拥护者就是苏联的朋友，是它在各民族间推行彻底的，不屈不挠的和平政策的朋友。反之，宣布自己是苏联敌人的人们及政府，事实上永远是新战争的公开或暗藏的挑拨者，也就是包括他们自己民族在内的一切民族的敌人。
    进步的、中国最有才智者之一，伟大作家鲁迅，远在十七年前，在他自己的一篇文章里就已写过：“帝国主义和我们，除了它的奴才之外，那一样利害不和我们正相反？我们的痈疽，是它们的宝贝，那么，它们的敌人，当然是我们的朋友了。它们自己正在崩溃下去，无法支持，为挽救自己的末途，便憎恶苏联的向上。谣诼、诅咒、怨恨，无所不至，没有效，终于只得准备动手去打了。一定要灭掉它才睡得着。但我们干什么呢？我们还会再被骗吗？”（这一段话见鲁迅著“我们不再受骗了”一文）
    是的，中国的人民和苏联的人民是朋友。而我们两个民族的共同敌人是帝国主义者。如果说这些帝国主义者们在三十二年中色厉内荏地仇恨苏联，那么，无疑的，目前，在中华人民共和国成立之后，他们也将极端狂暴地反对这一共和国，这一共和国的政府，已经宣布人民民主，各民族平等及民族之间和平的原则。
    是的，应当想一想，我们共同的敌人——战争挑拨者的狂暴，吓不了伟大的中国人民，也如三十二年来它不能吓倒由伟大的列宁和伟大的斯大林所领导的苏联人民一样。
    我们两大民族将鄙视我们共同的敌人，和平的敌人的凶恶的阴谋。我们两个伟大民族在生活及文化一切领域内，将安静地从事巩固自己友好的工作。我们苏联人深切地关怀：如何使苏联全国广泛阶层能够更完全地和更深刻地认识中国人民古代的伟大文化，认识他们的英勇的解放斗争的历史，认识他们在生活各领域中的现代的成就，认识他们现代的文化和艺术。
    我们向中国的同志们作一种诺言，在我们回到苏联之后，将尽我们自己的一切力量，使我们苏联的读者们和无线电听众们认识人民民主中国的一切成就。在我们访问中国的时候，我们亲眼看到这些成就，同时，苏维埃社会的广泛阶层对这些成就也将感到极大的兴趣。我们，苏维埃文化的活动家们，在自己方面也很乐意把我们自己在建设着新的共产主义社会的伟大国家中，在文化、文学、艺术和国民教育领域内所获得的各种成就，介绍给先进的中国社会的广泛阶层。
    亲爱的同志们，无线电听众们，我的简短的讲演要结束了，让我代表苏联文化工作者，再一次向你们致最热烈的、最友好的敬意，并祝你们各位在人民民主中国的伟大建设中的成功，祝各位在农村、在工厂、在机关、在学校、在大学、在军队里工作的成功。
    具有伟大传统的中苏两大民族巩固的牢不可破的、永恒的友谊万岁！
    世界上任何力量不能破坏和动摇的我们伟大的友谊万岁！
