　　Thanking the Soviet Union for Recognizing New China and Celebrating the Establishment of New Diplomatic Relations Between China and the Soviet Union (Two)
　　[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] Following the announcement of the Soviet government's recognition of New China, leaders of various democratic parties and people's organizations have issued written opinions expressing their gratitude and warmly supporting the establishment of diplomatic relations and the exchange of ambassadors. The written opinions of the leaders of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, the China National Salvation Association, the Three People's Principles Comrades Association, and the China Association for Promoting Democracy of the Kuomintang are presented below:
    The Soviet government's formal recognition of the Central People's Government of New China demonstrates the profound friendship of the Soviet government and the Soviet people towards the Chinese people. This friendship is not only built on the basis of the interests of the two peoples, but also on the common task of opposing aggression and defending world peace. This task is sacred, great, and in line with the demands of peace-loving people all over the world. Sino-Soviet friendship has a thirty-year history, and the Soviet Union's sincere friendship and assistance to the Chinese people in the past has been the greatest, especially during the Northern Expedition and the War of Resistance Against Japan. Although the imperialists' agents in China—the Kuomintang reactionaries—did their utmost to undermine and slander it, the Chinese people will never forget their sincere friendship. Today, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great leader Chairman Mao, have finally crushed the reactionary rule and established a government of their own, making the friendship between the two countries consolidated anew amidst cheers of jubilation. This is a matter of great celebration. We shout:
    Long live the friendship between China and the Soviet Union! Peng Zemin
    The people of the whole country are welcoming the birth of the People's Republic of China and the Central People's Government with unparalleled joy. The next day, it immediately received recognition from the government of the great socialist Soviet Union. This shows the sincerity of the Soviet Union's friendship towards the Chinese people and the earnest attitude towards the new Chinese government. This is truly a most congratulatory event that adds even more glory to our brilliant founding history!
    The Soviet government's recognition of our new Chinese government is an unparalleled encouragement to our people across the country. This shows that our new China is not isolated in the world, just as Chairman Mao said, "Our friends are all over the world." The future construction of New China requires the equal and mutually beneficial assistance of international friends. The Soviet Union's recognition first reveals this dawn. We will from now on obtain favorable conditions so that construction can reach a perfect state more quickly and smoothly.
    The establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union will inevitably strengthen the forces of the world's peace and democracy camp, giving the imperialists' aggressive attempts a serious blow. From then on, the balance of power on the international stage will be more conducive to the peace and democracy camp, that is to say, the cause of world peace and democracy will be further guaranteed.
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Sha Qianli
    After the establishment of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, our friendly country, the Soviet Union, immediately established diplomatic relations with us, which makes us extremely happy and encouraged. The Soviet Union has always been extremely concerned about the Chinese revolution. Today, the Chinese people have stood up, established their own new People's Republic, and established their own new People's Government. It is only natural for the Soviet Union to recognize us first, suggest exchanging ambassadors, and deny the pseudo-Guangzhou government. Chairman Mao pointed out to us long ago that our diplomatic policy should consolidate and expand the anti-imperialist united front led by the Soviet Union. Today, the close alliance of the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union is the greatest guarantee for defending world peace and a serious blow to those who instigate war.
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Tan Pingshan
    I feel infinitely happy that our great friendly country, the Soviet Union, was the first to recognize the People's Republic of China.
    The Soviet Union has always maintained a deep and close friendship with the Chinese people. When Mr. Sun Yat-sen opened his government in Guangzhou, the Soviet Union gave great assistance to the revolutionary government at that time, thus enabling the smooth progress of the subsequent Northern Expedition. When Mr. Zhongshan was dying, he still wrote to the Soviet Union, never forgetting the cooperation between China and the Soviet Union. However, Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the revolution and repaid the Soviet Union with ingratitude. But the Soviet Union's friendship with the Chinese people has remained unwavering. In the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Soviet Union provided the most assistance to China, which enabled our country to support the difficult situation. After defeating fascist Germany, the Soviet Union sent troops to defeat the powerful Japanese Kwantung Army and liberate the entire Northeast. The Chinese people are deeply aware of the Soviet Union's deep and close friendship with our people.
    Now, the day after the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet government was the first to recognize our Central People's Government and is willing to establish diplomatic relations with us. Not only am I personally infinitely happy, but also all 475 million people in China are infinitely happy. Because with the deep and close friendship between China and the Soviet Union, not only will the construction of our country advance by leaps and bounds with the help of the Soviet Union, but also, as Mr. Sun Yat-sen said: "In the struggle to liberate the oppressed peoples of the world, these two allies will go hand in hand to victory, and such a day is not far away."

　　各党派团体负责人发表书面意见
    感谢苏联承认新中国  庆祝中苏建立新邦交（二）
    【本报特讯】苏联政府承认新中国的消息发表后，各民主党派及人民团体负责人纷纷发表局面意见，表示感谢，并热烈拥护建立外交关系及互派大使。兹续将中国农工民主党、中国人民救国会、三民主义同志联合会、中国国民党民主促进会负责人的书面意见发表如下：
    苏联政府正式承认新中国中央人民政府，说明苏联政府，苏联人民对中国人民深厚的友谊；这友谊，不仅建立在两国人民利益基础之上，而且在反对侵略保卫世界和平共同的任务上；这任务，是神圣的，伟大的，是符合全世界爱好和平人民的要求的。中苏友谊，有三十年历史，苏联过去对中国人民真诚友谊的帮助，是最伟大的。特别是在北伐，在抗战中。虽中经帝国主义在中国的代理人——国民党反动派，极尽破坏诬蔑之能事，但中国人民对其真诚友谊，是永矢不能忘记的。今天，中国人民终于在中国共产党，伟大领袖毛主席领导之下，摧毁了反动统治，建立了人民自己的政府，使两国友谊在万众欢呼中从新巩固起来，这是何等值得庆贺的大事。我们高呼：
    中苏两国友谊万岁！彭泽民
    全国人民正以无比的欢欣来迎接中华人民共和国以及中央人民政府的诞生。第二天，立刻就得到了伟大的社会主义苏联政府的承认。这表示苏联对于中国人民是具有何等真诚的友谊，对于新中国政府是抱着何等恳挚的态度，这真是我们辉煌的开国史上更增光彩的一件最可庆贺的大事！
    苏联政府的承认我们新中国政府，给我们全国人民的鼓舞是无可比拟的。这表示我们新中国在世界上不是孤立的，真如毛主席所说“我们的朋友遍于全世界”。新中国将来的建设，需要国际友人平等互利的帮助。苏联的承认，首先透露了这一曙光。我们从此将获得有利的条件，使建设事业可以更迅速更顺利地达到完美的境地。
    中苏两国的建立外交关系，必然的壮大了世界和平民主阵营的力量，给帝国主义者的侵略企图以严重的打击。从此国际舞台上力量的对比，将更有利于和平民主阵营，也就是，世界和平民主事业，将获得更进一步的保障。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　沙千里
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府成立后，我们友邦苏联立即与我们建立外交关系，使我们异常欢欣鼓舞。苏联对中国革命，素来是异常关切的，今天中国人民站起来，自己建立新的人民共和国，自己建立新的人民政府，苏联对我们首先承认，建议互派大使，并否认伪广州政府，这是很自然的事。毛主席早向我们指出外交政策，要巩固和扩大以苏联为首的反帝国主义的统一战线。今日中苏两大民族的国家密切联合，这种伟大的力量，是保卫世界和平最大的保证，对于战争的鼓动者一个严重的打击。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　谭平山
    我对于苏联伟大友邦首先承认我中华人民共和国感到无限的欢欣。
    苏联对我中国人民自来保持着深厚亲切的友谊，当孙中山先生开府广州之时，苏联曾给当时的革命政府以极大的帮助，因而使后来之北伐革命战争顺利进行。中山先生临终的时候，犹致书苏联，念念不忘中苏两国携手合作。乃蒋介石背叛革命，对苏联以怨报德，但苏联对中国人民的友谊，还是始终不渝。抗日战争初期，苏联援助中国独多，我国用能支持艰危局面。苏联于击败法西斯德国之后，复出兵击败日本强大的关东军，解放全东北。苏联对我国人民这种深厚亲切的友谊，是全中国人民所深切了解的。
    现在，我中华人民共和国宣告成立第二天，苏联政府又首先承认我中央人民政府，愿与我建立外交关系，这不仅我个人无限欢欣，全中国四万万七千五百万人也无限欢欣。因为中苏两国有了深厚亲切的友谊，不仅我国各项建设事业，将因苏联的帮助而突飞猛进，而且正如孙中山先生所说：“在解放全世界被压迫民族的斗争中，这两个同盟者将手携手的走向胜利，这样的日子已经不远了。”
