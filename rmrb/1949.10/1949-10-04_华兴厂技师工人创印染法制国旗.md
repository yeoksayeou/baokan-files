　　Huaxing Factory Technicians and Workers Create Flag-Making Method Using Printing and Dyeing

　　[Our Newspaper] Recently, technicians and workers at the Beijing Huaxing Textile Dyeing Factory, which had newly added printing equipment, successfully researched and developed a method of manufacturing national flags using printing, celebrating the birth of New China with this practical action. They have already begun mass-producing new national flags according to the prescribed standards to meet the needs of various regions. Shenyang has already sent a telegram ordering 20,000 flags. The red cloth used in this manufacturing method is non-fading Nafutuohong (Naphtol Red) cloth. The national flags produced are not only more complete and beautiful than those made by the ordinary patching method, guaranteeing certain specifications, but also saving materials, reducing manufacturing costs by two-thirds. The manufacturing method uses a special medicine that can absorb part of the color of the Nafutuohong cloth and simultaneously dye it yellow in just one step, without damaging the fabric or causing it to fade. Currently, the factory can produce 3,000 new national flags every day.
