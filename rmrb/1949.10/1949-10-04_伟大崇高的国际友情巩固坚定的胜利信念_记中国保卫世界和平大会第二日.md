　　Great and Sublime International Friendship Consolidates Firm Belief in Victory
    Recording the Second Day of the China Conference for the Defense of World Peace
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] Vice Chairman Zhu De spoke at the China Conference for the Defense of World Peace yesterday. He first reported some good news, saying: The Soviet Union has formally recognized the new China. The venue immediately erupted, with applause, cheers, and music... People rushed to the seats of the Soviet delegation, vigorously shaking hands and tightly embracing them. The entire venue was filled with joy, and the eyes of many were moist with emotion. The great and sublime international friendship seemed especially warm and precious to the already victorious Chinese people.

    Truly, one piece of good news follows another. The new China was proclaimed on October 1st, and as the Chinese people were celebrating enthusiastically, the good news of the Soviet Union's formal recognition of the new China followed closely. Recalling that after the October Revolution, the Soviet Union was the first to abolish the unequal treaties imposed on our country by the Tsarist government, and has since continuously aided the Chinese people, now, the Soviet Union is the first to recognize the new China. Who our good friends are is perfectly clear. More than a thousand people participated in this conference, including representatives from various democratic parties, organizations, ethnic groups, and overseas Chinese in our country, as well as the Soviet delegation, the delegation from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Italian people's representative, Spano. Everyone repeatedly stood up and cheered for the great victory of the Chinese people, for lasting world peace, for Stalin, and for Mao Zedong. Everyone expressed a common belief in different languages: Victory belongs to the peace-loving people of the world, it belongs to us.

    From the day before yesterday to yesterday, ten or twenty representatives spoke at this conference. Chinese, Soviets, Koreans, and Italians all denounced the imperialist war-mongers and expressed their determination and confidence in the struggle for lasting world peace. When Vice Chairman Zhu spoke, he shouted, "Long live world peace!" Simonov sent "fraternal greetings" to the Chinese representatives present, praising us—"The Chinese people are eliminating war-mongers for their own future peaceful life and peaceful construction, and for the peace of the whole world." Park Chung-ae, Chairman of the Korean Democratic Women's League, representing the 30 million people of Korea, paid high tribute to the people of our country, and she firmly believed that relying on the strength of the Soviet Union, China, and the people of the world, the imperialists' conspiracies to provoke war would surely be shattered. Spano said: The Italian people have the power to stop war. In Italy, the forces of peace are also greater than the forces of war. Imperialists are absolutely not allowed to fight against the Soviet Union and the New Democratic countries. When the conference passed the declaration, three international friends of different nationalities applauded with the same fervor as the Chinese representatives, expressing great joy at the solemn declaration made by the Chinese people to the world.

    The Chinese people have always loved peace. The Chinese people fully understand that the strong unity of the world's progressive humanity will be a solid guarantee of world peace. Representatives from all walks of life in our country warmly welcomed the distinguished international guests at the conference with great sincerity. Representatives from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions presented flowers to the conference and the Soviet delegation, as well as Beijing specialties—carpets and cloisonné. Fadeyev, Simonov, and four others then walked onto the stage. After Wang Rui, a representative of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, gave a brief speech, he shouted "Long live the solidarity of the Chinese and Soviet working class" and embraced Fadeyev and Simonov tightly. The representatives of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions also presented the same gifts to the Korean delegation and Spano. Representatives from the Democratic Women's Federation presented Beijing specialties—embroidery and velvet flowers to the international friends. They said: These are gifts made by Chinese women themselves with thousands of stitches, given to our dearest friends. Bright red velvet flowers were pinned on the chests of the international friends, reflecting the red glow on everyone's faces, which was very kind and touching. The gift-giving delegation from the Youth League, the All-China Youth Federation, and the All-China Students' Federation, including young people and children, each held a bouquet of flowers and a white paper dove symbolizing peace. Others held copper seals on trays. Gao Tang addressed the international friends, hoping that the friends would "carry the seals with them, representing the hearts of our Chinese youth, and be closely united with the people and youth of your country," and "even more, we hope that you can often tell us the news of your country's struggle for peace, stamp it with this seal, and sign your glorious names." Fadeyev, Spano, and other friends picked up the children presenting the seals, reluctant to put them down for a long time. A great international friendship filled the entire venue.

　　伟大崇高的国际友情巩固坚定的胜利信念
    记中国保卫世界和平大会第二日
    【本报特写】朱德副主席昨天在中国保卫世界和平大会上讲话。他首先报告了一个好消息，他说：苏联已经正式承认新中国了。会场立刻沸腾起来，鼓掌、欢呼、奏乐……人们纷纷跑到苏联代表团的席位周围，和他们着力地握手，紧紧地拥抱。全场一片欢喜之声，许多人的眼圈被感动得湿润了。伟大崇高的国际友情，在已经胜利了的中国人民看起来，特别温暖和珍贵。
    真是一件喜事紧接着一件喜事。新中国于十月一日宣告成立，中国人民正在欢腾庆祝，苏联正式承认新中国的喜讯即接踵而来。回忆十月革命以后，苏联首先废除了沙皇政府对于我国的不平等条约，以后即一直不断援助中国人民，现在，苏联又第一个承认了新中国。谁是我们的好朋友，真是再清楚不过了。参加这个大会的有一千多人，其中包括我国各民主党派、各团体、各民族和海外华侨的代表，还有苏联代表团，朝鲜人民共和国代表团及意大利人民代表斯巴诺。大家无数次地为中国人民的伟大胜利，为世界的持久和平，为斯大林，为毛泽东而起立欢呼，大家以不同的言语道出共同的信念：胜利属于世界爱好和平的人民，属于我们。
    从前天到昨天，一、二十位代表在这个会上讲了话。中国人、苏联人、朝鲜人、意大利人一致痛斥帝国主义战争贩子，表示了为世界持久和平而斗争的决心与信心。朱副主席在讲话时高呼“世界和平万岁！”西蒙诺夫向到会的我国代表们“致兄弟的敬礼”，他赞扬我们——“中国人民为了自己未来和平生活与和平建设，为了全世界的和平而消灭着战争贩子。”朝鲜人民共和国女性同盟委员长朴正爱代表朝鲜三千万人民，向我国人民致崇高的敬礼，她坚信依靠苏联、中国及世界人民的力量，必可打碎帝国主义者一切挑拨战争的阴谋。斯巴诺说：意大利人民有力量阻止战争，在意大利，和平力量同样大于战争力量，绝不允许帝国主义者同苏联及新民主主义国家作战。大会通过宣言时，三个不同国籍的国际友人，和我国代表同样的狂热鼓掌，他们对于中国人民向全世界的庄严宣告，表示了极大的欢欣。
    中国人民一贯爱好和平。中国人民充分地懂得，世界进步人类的坚强团结，将是世界和平的巩固保证。我国各界人民代表，在大会上十分虔诚地欢迎了国际的贵宾。全国总工会的代表向大会及苏联代表团献花，献北京的特产——地毯和景泰蓝。法捷耶夫、西蒙诺夫等四人这时走上主席台。全总代表王瑞简短致词后，高呼“中苏工人阶级团结万岁”，和法捷耶夫、西蒙诺夫紧紧地拥抱起来。全总代表也向朝鲜代表团及斯巴诺献了同样的礼物。民主妇联的代表向国际友人献北京特产——刺绣和绒花。她们说：这是中国妇女亲手用千针万线绣成的礼物，赠给我们最亲爱的友人。一朵朵鲜红的绒花挂在国际朋友的胸前，映着大家脸上的红色的光采，十分亲切动人。青年团、青联、学联的献礼代表团，包括青年和儿童，每人手持一束鲜花，一个象征和平的白色纸鸽。另有一些人用盘子托着铜质的图章。高棠向国际友人致词，希望友人们“把图章带在身边，表示着我们中国青年的心，和你们国家的人民和青年紧紧地团结在一起”，“更希望你们能经常把你们国家为和平奋斗的消息告诉我们，盖上这个图章，签上你们光辉的名字。”法耶捷夫、斯巴诺等友人把献图章的孩子们抱起来，长时不愿放下，一种伟大的国际友情，充溢着整个的会场。
