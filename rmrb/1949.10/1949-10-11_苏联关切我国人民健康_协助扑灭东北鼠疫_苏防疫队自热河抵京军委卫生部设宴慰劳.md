　　The Soviet Union Concerned About the Health of Our People
    Assists in Suppressing the Plague in Northeast China
    Soviet Anti-Epidemic Team Arrives in Beijing from Rehe, Military Commission Health Department Holds Banquet in Their Honor
　  Soviet Anti-Epidemic Team Diligently Assists for Five Months, Catches Seven Million Rats
    [Reported by this newspaper] At 6 PM on the 9th, the Health Department of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission held a banquet to honor the First Anti-Epidemic Detachment of the Soviet Red Cross and Red Crescent Society, which had just returned from Rehe. After the banquet, Minister He Cheng personally accompanied the team to the Zhongshan Park Music Hall to attend a performance by the Soviet Art Troupe and the Chinese Democratic Youth League Art Troupe.
    The plague in Northeast China has been occurring for years, causing great harm to the people. Since 1947, the Soviet Red Cross and Red Crescent Society has sent anti-epidemic teams every year to guide and assist in the prevention and control of plague. In May of this year, led by Chief Representative Maiyasi and Deputy Chief Representative Strellezov, the team came to China despite their hard work and went deep into the countryside to guide and cooperate with administrative and health personnel at all levels in Northeast China to mobilize the masses to carry out plague prevention and control campaigns. In the past five months, they have captured 7,360,000 rats (each weighing approximately three taels, totaling approximately 2.2208 million catties, equivalent to over 1,100 metric tons, requiring 28 train carriages to transport). As a result of their efforts to improve environmental sanitation, prevent and eliminate fleas, universally implement preventive vaccinations, and strictly implement isolation of patients and healthy individuals, the incidence of plague has been greatly reduced in the past three years. The number of cases fell from 30,326 with 23,171 deaths in 1947, to 5,493 cases with 3,924 deaths in 1948. According to this year's statistics, as of September 10, the number of cases has been reduced to only 144, with 69 deaths.
    At the evening meeting on the 9th, Cao Yu of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association General Council briefly introduced the above situation to the audience and expressed his gratitude. The audience immediately burst into prolonged and enthusiastic applause to thank the Soviet Union for its deep friendship and assistance to the Chinese people and shouted "Long live Sino-Soviet friendship!"

　　苏联关切我国人民健康
    协助扑灭东北鼠疫
    苏防疫队自热河抵京军委卫生部设宴慰劳
　  苏防疫队辛勤协助五个月捕鼠七百万
    【本报讯】九日晚六时中国人民革命军事委员会卫生部，设宴慰劳甫由热河归来之苏联红十字半月协会防疫第一分队。宴后并由贺诚部长亲自作陪，赴中山公园音乐堂参加苏联艺术演出队与中国民主青年代表团文工团之演出晚会。
    按东北鼠疫经年发生，对人民危害甚大，自一九四七年来，苏联红十字半月协会，每年均派防疫队前来指导及帮助防治鼠疫工作。今年五月间在麦亚斯基及斯特莱雷佐夫总副代表率领下，该队不辞劳苦来到中国，并深入农村，指导和配合东北各级行政及卫生人员，发动群众，进行防治鼠疫运动。五个月来，捕捉老鼠七百三十六万只（每只重量以三两计，约有两百二十万零八千斤，折合一千一百余公吨，需要二十八个火车车厢装载）。由于他们努力提高环境卫生防蚤灭蚤，普遍施行预防注射，严格执行患者与健康者隔离等积极治疗的结果，三年来鼠疫发生率已大大下降。由一九四七年发病者三万零三百二十六人，死亡两万三千一百七十一人，一九四八年降到发病者五千四百九十三人，死亡三千九百二十四人，据今年的统计，到九月十日截止已降低到发病者仅一百四十四人，死亡六十九人。
    在九日晚会上，经中苏友好协会总会曹禺，将上略的情形简述向全场观众作介绍并致谢意后，全场立即激起经久不息的热烈鼓掌，感谢苏联对于中国人民的深厚友谊及帮助，并高呼中苏友好万岁！（陈子坚）
