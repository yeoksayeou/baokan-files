Think Less About Personal Matters!
    Lang Zhou
    When the organization assigns work to some comrades, they come up with a pile of personal problems: can't leave their spouse, family life issues, unwilling to go to the countryside, wondering how life will be there, incompatibility with personal interests, inability to handle the physical demands... In short, when it comes to work, they put personal interests first. Only when personal problems are resolved can they work with peace of mind; otherwise, they will become emotional and complain. There are even individual comrades who, after joining the revolutionary ranks, are constantly preoccupied with personal enjoyment, talking about how well they used to eat and how beautifully they used to dress. Here, a problem arises—a class standpoint issue. That is, to which class did you belong in the past? And on whose side are you standing now to serve whom? If you were born into the feudal and decadent class and still do not reject that exploitative, despicable, and shameful life in your thinking, but instead are still nostalgic for the past, then of course it will be impossible for you to see clearly the specific problems placed before you. But conversely, if you used to live under feudal and reactionary rule, working all day just to eat, or even working all day without being able to maintain the most basic living standards, and were often subjected to beatings and scoldings, then today, coming to the revolutionary ranks, you will naturally find everything comforting and everywhere enjoyable. I remember when I was staying at a guest house in a certain school, there was a peasant comrade who had just come from a disaster area. He picked up a bowl of millet rice mixed with red beans and said with great joy: "This millet rice is so good, I can eat my fill even without any side dishes." Another young lady who had just come from a bourgeois family frowned after the same meal and said: "Oh, my God, I can't eat this! Today I only ate half full." Think about how starkly the contrast between the two different class backgrounds is revealed in just eating this one meal!
    Yes, within the possible range, the organization tries its best to take care of the comrades. For example, regarding the spouse issue, the organization tries its best to find ways to assign the two to work together; regarding the burden of family life, the organization also tries its best to take care of it. However, all requests should be based on the principle that they do not exceed the current conditions; otherwise, they become unreasonable demands, and it becomes difficult for the organization to handle.
    The organization is trying its best to care for us, and we individuals should also deeply consider whether we have come to dedicate ourselves to the revolution, or merely to solve personal problems? Have individuals come to make revolution for the sake of hundreds of millions of people, or merely to solve the problems of spouse and family? Look again at our Liberation Army comrades. They live in a long-term cruel struggle. They fight north and south, they have traversed high mountains and great rivers, and they have experienced the hardships that we have not experienced. In battles, they sometimes go several days without food and several nights without sleep. They don't distinguish between day and night and have no holidays or Sundays. They shed their last drop of blood, breathed their last breath, and devoted their lives to the revolution. They not only never complained, but considered it an unparalleled honor. What is their treatment like? It is nothing more than coarse clothes and simple food. Comrades! Standing before these hundreds of millions of heroes today, what should we feel?
    The reason why a person can be called a glorious revolutionary lies in the revolutionary's great outlook on life that puts the worries of the world before their own and enjoys the happiness of the world after the world is happy, the revolutionary spirit of sacrificing oneself to save the masses. These heroes believe that sacrificing the individual self for the cause of liberating mankind and defending peace is the greatest and most glorious thing.
    The current situation is developing rapidly, and the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, who are in dire straits, are eagerly awaiting our liberation. All construction work is waiting for us to work hard. Comrades! Think less about personal matters!

　　少为个人打算点吧！
    浪舟
    有些同志当组织上分配他的工作的时候，就来了一堆个人问题：离不开爱人呀，家庭生活呀，不愿到乡村呀，到那里不知生活怎么样呀，个人兴趣不合呀，身体支持不了呀……总之谈到工作首先就把个人利益放在前头，个人问题解决了，才能去安心工作，否则就要闹情绪，发牢骚；更有个别的同志到革命阵营后，始终斤斤于个人享受，谈起来就是我过去吃多好呀，穿多么漂亮呀，在这里就发生了一个问题——阶级立场问题，就是你以往是属于什么阶级？现在你又是站在什么立场上来为谁服务，设若你是出身在封建的腐朽阶级，目前在思想上仍不否定那种剥削卑鄙可耻的生活，反而仍恋恋不舍于过往，那当然对摆在你面前的具体问题不可能想通。可是反过来，你若是过去是在封建的反动统治下，劳动一天吃一天，甚至劳动一天连最低劣的生活也维持不了，并经常生活在人家的打骂下，那末今天到革命阵营来，很自然的事事会使你安慰，处处会叫你快乐的。还记得当我在某校住招待所的时候，有一位刚来自灾区的贫农同志，端起了掺有红豆的小米饭，就喜不自禁的说：“这小米饭真好，没菜俺也能吃个饱。”另一位刚来自资产阶级家庭的小姐在同一顿饭后却皱着眉头说：“唉，老天爷呀，这饭我可吃不了！今天我只吃了个半饱。”想想看就从吃这一顿饭上两个不同阶级出身的对照是如何的鲜明！
    是的，在可能围范内，组织上对同志们是尽量照顾的，如爱人问题，组织上是尽量想办法把两人分配在一起工作的；家庭生活负担，组织上也是尽量想办法照顾，不过一切要求应以不能超过目前的条件为原则，否则就成了不合理的要求，组织上就很难办了。
    组织上想尽方法的在关心我们，而我们个人也应该深刻的想一想个人究竟是来献身革命呢？还仅仅是来为了解决个人问题呢？个人是为千百万的人民而来革命呢？还仅仅是为解决爱人及家庭问题而来革命呢？再看看我们解放军的同志们，他们长期生活在残酷的斗争中，他们转战南北，他们跋涉遍了高山大川，他们经历了我们所没经历过的艰难困苦，战斗中有几天不吃饭几夜不睡觉的，他们不分白天和黑夜更没有什么假期和星期日，他们流了最后的一滴血，吐出了最后的一口气，鞠躬尽瘁的终生献身革命，他们不但从未叫过苦，却认为是无上的光荣。他们的待遇怎样呢？也不过是粗衣粗食罢了。同志！我们今天站在这成千百万的英雄面前该作何感想呢？
    一个人之所以称得起一位光荣的革命者，就在于他有先天下之忧而忧，后天下之乐而乐的革命的舍己救群的伟大人生观。这些英雄们认为为了解放人类保卫和平的事业而牺牲了小我，是最伟大最光荣的事情。
    目前形势是突飞猛进的向前发展着，水深火热中的蒋区人民急待我们去解放，一切建设工作在等待我们去努力，同志！少为个人打算点吧！
