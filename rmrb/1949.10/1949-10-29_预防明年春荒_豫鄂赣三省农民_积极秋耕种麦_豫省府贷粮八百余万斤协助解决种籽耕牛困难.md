Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 28th: Farmers in Henan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces, under the leadership and support of the People's Government, are intensively engaged in autumn cultivation. Henan suffered from successive floods, droughts, and insect plagues this year, resulting in a poor summer wheat harvest. In the autumn, continuous rain caused significant damage to autumn crops. Hubei also experienced severe flooding. Jiangxi Province's lakeside areas also suffered from floods. To prevent and alleviate famine next spring, local People's Governments are calling on farmers to seize the agricultural season for autumn cultivation and wheat planting. They are also issuing large amounts of loans and seeds to solve the wheat seed difficulties of poor disaster victims. In September, the Henan Provincial Government issued loans for wheat seeds and oxen totaling 8.09 million jin of grain. The Hubei Provincial Government has allocated 2 million jin of wheat for loans. The Central Plains People's Government allocated 1.5 million jin of wheat seeds to disaster-stricken people in Jiangxi for production. At the same time, local banks are implementing low-interest loans, and state-owned stores are also selling wheat seeds at low prices, while also mobilizing farmers to help each other borrow seeds. To solve the problem of animal power, the government is actively providing loans to purchase more oxen and organizing farmers to exchange labor and help each other. For the families of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, and workers who lack labor, local farmers are mobilized to organize cultivation on their behalf. In mobilizing farmers for autumn cultivation, various localities have also exposed and cracked down on the illegal activities of special agents, despotic landlords who sabotage, spread rumors, and threaten farmers in order to relieve farmers' concerns. In Henan, during the anti-despot liquidation struggles and the implementation of rent and interest reduction movements, it has been discovered that landlords are attempting to disperse land or forcibly withdraw land to coerce tenant farmers, rich peasants are neglecting cultivation, eating and drinking extravagantly, and destroying agricultural implements. This has affected the general farmers, who fear that there will be changes in land ownership and are afraid to sow. To this end, the Provincial Government has explicitly proposed "whoever sows, reaps, and bears the responsibility," in order to protect the legitimate interests of working farmers. At the same time, in-depth publicity and explanation are being carried out: if there are changes in land relations, the land distribution households will guarantee compensation to the original farming households for their labor and farming expenses, and it is announced that rich peasants neglecting cultivation is an illegal act, and it is explained that the People's Government firmly protects the interests of middle peasants. This has dispelled the farmers' concerns. After the phenomenon of despotic landlords threatening farmers with eviction occurred in Wuchang County, Hubei Province, the People's Government immediately stated its position that despotic landlords are not allowed to illegally withdraw land. In autumn cultivation, local governments, on the one hand, encourage planting more early-maturing crops such as beans and vegetables in preparation for the spring famine next year. On the other hand, they advocate saving as much as possible for famine prevention, putting forward the slogans "Saving one or two liang of rice today, you will suffer one less meal tomorrow spring" and "Planting one more mu of land this year will reduce one household of disaster next spring." In addition, to prevent floods next year, various localities have formulated winter dike repair plans. The Jingzhou sub-district in Hubei has begun surveying and estimating rivers, and it is expected that the closure and restoration of the embankments will be fully completed by April next spring. In areas where water has not receded, efforts are being made to actively drain water to expand the area for wheat planting.

    豫省府贷粮八百余万斤协助解决种籽耕牛困难
    【新华社汉口二十八日电】河南、湖北、江西三省农民在人民政府领导和扶助下，正紧张进行秋耕。河南今年因连遭水、旱、虫、灾，夏麦歉收，入秋又霪雨连绵，秋禾受损极大。湖北水灾也很严重。江西省滨湖各地也有水患。各地人民政府为防止和减轻明春灾荒，号召各地农民抓紧农时秋耕种麦，并发放大量贷款贷种，解决贫苦灾民的麦种困难。河南省政府九月间已发放麦种及耕牛贷款共合粮食八百零九万斤。湖北省政府已拨小麦二百万斤用于贷放。中原人民政府拨发一百五十万斤麦种贷给江西灾民生产。同时各地银行实行低息贷款，公营商店亦低价出售麦种，并发动农民互助借种。为解决畜力问题，政府一面积极贷款增购耕牛，一面组织农民换工互助。对缺乏劳动力的烈、军、工属，则发动当地农民组织代耕。各地在发动农民进行秋耕中并揭发和打击了特务、恶霸地主的破坏、造谣、威胁农民的不法行为，以解除农民顾虑。河南在反恶霸清算斗争和实行减租减息运动中，已发现地主企图分散土地或抽地威逼佃农，富农怠耕，大吃大喝，破坏农具等现象，影响一般农民恐怕土地有变动，不敢播种。为此，该省府已明确提出“谁种谁收谁负担”，以保护劳动农民的应得利益。同时深入宣传解释：凡土地关系有变化者，将来分地户保证补偿原耕户所出劳力和耕作费用，宣布富农怠耕是非法行为，说明人民政府坚决保护中农利益，这样农民始打破顾虑。湖北省武昌县在发生恶霸地主以退佃威胁农民的现象后，人民政府立即表明态度，不准恶霸地主非法抽地。各地政府在秋耕中一面鼓励多种早熟作物及豆、菜等备明年春荒，一面提倡尽量节约备荒，提出“今天节省一两米，明春少挨一顿饿”、“以今年多种一亩田，明春减少一户灾”的口号。此外，为防备明年水灾，各地均纷纷制订冬季修堤计划。湖北荆州分区已开始江、河测估工作，预计明春四月全部完成堤岸的堵复工程，在积水未退地区则积极排水扩大种麦面积。
