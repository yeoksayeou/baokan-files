Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 18th: The remnant reactionary forces' attempt to hold Xiamen Island to cover Taiwan was liberated at 11:00 AM on the 17th. Less than two days after the liberation of Xiamen is the thirteenth anniversary of Mr. Lu Xun's death.

Twenty-two years ago, from the autumn of 1926 to the spring of 1927, I spent half a year with Mr. Lu Xun at Xiamen University on this island. In this short period, I can point out three great contributions he made to the revolutionary struggle, which are enough for us to learn and be vigilant about:

First, Mr. Lu Xun's resoluteness in the revolutionary struggle: At that time, Xiamen University was full of capitalism, feudalism, and comprador, colonial characteristics. After the "March 18th" revolution in the capital, Mr. Lu Xun and a group of us really couldn't bear the oppression of the dark forces of the Northern Warlords. We wanted to find a quiet place to hide temporarily and do scholarship, so we accepted Lin Yutang's invitation and went to Xiamen together. Who knew that as soon as we arrived in Xiamen, we immediately found that the atmosphere was simply not what we thought. Although a group of bookworms still wanted to shut themselves up to study and teach, ignoring external affairs, Mr. Lu Xun, with his revolutionary nature, couldn't bear it. He believed that we should not learn the compromise of "gentlemen," we must hold the attitude of "befriending those who agree and attacking those who differ" and fight against reactionary forces. He felt that simple and innocent young people were always better than "scholars" full of worldly wisdom. So in this half-year, he completely stood on the side of the youth and waged a resolute struggle against reactionary ideas and obsequious figures. Most of his thoughts at that time were reflected in "Letters Between Two Places," so I won't repeat them. I just want to give two small examples to show his resolute attitude. The first time he received his salary from Xiamen University, a check for four hundred yuan, he went to the "Meifeng Bank" in Xiamen to cash it himself. As usual, the money-grubbing foreigners in the commercial port rolled their eyes upward, how could they look up to an old man wearing a broken gray cloth cotton robe with long hair? One of them asked, "Is this check yours?" Mr. Lu Xun took a puff of his cigarette and gave him a white look, saying nothing; he asked three times, and Mr. Lu Xun took three puffs of his cigarette. The check was finally cashed in the silent protest. When he was about to go to Guangzhou, the president of Xiamen University gave him a farewell dinner, and some capitalists were present. The president introduced one of them, saying: "Mr. So-and-so is our director. Our private university doesn't care about anything else, whoever donates money can be a director." Mr. Lu Xun unhesitatingly took out two mao (ten cents) from his pocket and slapped it on the table, saying: "Can I be a director if I donate two mao?" This was another of his protests with words.

Second, Mr. Lu Xun's persistence in the revolutionary struggle: People familiar with the history of the Chinese revolution know that many advanced fighters were also very enthusiastic about the revolution at first, but because of hesitation and wavering, they could not be firm, and often betrayed midway and could not carry out their original intentions. Although Mr. Lu Xun's revolutionary stages were different, he always held the attitude of fighting against darkness from beginning to end and never compromised. Let me draw another negative example from my memories of Xiamen. Back then, Lin Yutang was still quite open-minded at Xiamen University and stood on the same front as Mr. Lu Xun. So when he was forced to leave Xiamen University, some of us sympathized with him and went with him. In 1927, when he went from Shanghai to Hankou, two or three of us personally went to the Jinliyuan Wharf to see him off. After the failure of the Great Revolution, he made some foreign money by selling "My Country and My People" and lived in Shanghai as a retired scholar. When he met old partners again, he would ask "How is Lu Xun lately?" The tone revealed that he no longer regarded Lu Xun as his revolutionary mentor as he did in Xiamen. At the end of the Anti-Japanese War, he returned to China from the United States once, and when he gave a lecture at the Southwest Associated University in Kunming, he asked people, "Are the students still left-leaning now?" And he published a crooked poem with uneven tones and the same "right-leaning" consciousness in "Cosmic Wind." When I thought back to Xiamen, back to the Jinliyuan Wharf, I decided not to meet him. After he returned to the United States for the second time, he published a book called "Pillow on a Spear, Awaiting Dawn," flattering a group of powerful and treacherous officials in Chongqing, from Kong Xiangxi to Xiong Shihui, to the point of making people's skin crawl. Last year's published "Biography of Su Dongpo" even used the opposition between Su Dongpo and Wang Anshi to praise the Kuomintang and scold the Communist Party. As a result, his exquisite residence on the East River in New York became a place for He Yingqin and C.C.'s henchmen to relax, and a group of people who valued their own purity kept their feet away. Of course, the current Lin Yutang cannot be compared with Mr. Lu Xun, but he once claimed to be a "fighter" back then. His path of betrayal can serve as a mirror for intellectuals with unstable and unsustainable revolutionary character!

Third, the development of Mr. Lu Xun's revolutionary struggle: Mr. Lu Xun's ideological development went through several stages. Qu Qiubai pointed out in the preface to the "Selected Essays of Lu Xun": Lu Xun "advanced from evolutionism to class theory, from the rebellious son and disloyal minister of the gentry class to the true friend and even warrior of the proletariat and the working masses. He has experienced a quarter of a century of battle from before the Xinhai Revolution to the present, bringing valuable revolutionary traditions to the new camp from painful experiences and profound observations." Judging from my few months of living with him in Xiamen, and looking at the time before and after he joined the League of Left-Wing Writers in 1928, one can imagine his arduous ideological struggle and rigorous self-criticism. However, what makes Mr. Lu Xun permanently respectable is precisely his arduous, unremitting, and developing nature of revolution. Mao Dun said: "To be good at learning from Lu Xun, we must first understand the path of Lu Xun's ideological development; there are many things in Lu Xun's thoughts and works that we can learn from, but today, when intellectuals especially need self-transformation, the process that Lu Xun experienced from evolutionism to class theory, from individualism to collectivism, is especially worthy of our attention and learning."

Mr. Lu Xun had a revolutionary endowment and a strong and persistent fighting spirit, but if he could not discover his own mistakes at any time, be brave in transforming himself, and move forward towards the correct goal, he would never be admired by the broad masses today. Intellectuals should always learn from Mr. Lu Xun's unremitting development, and at the same time, they must always use people like Lin Yutang who are content to degenerate to warn themselves!

　　从厦门解放引起的感想　
    为鲁迅逝世十三周年纪念作
    北大教授  罗常培
    据新华社福建前线十八日电：残余反动势力妄图坚守以掩护台湾的厦门岛已经在十七日上午十一时解放了。在厦门解放后不到两天就是鲁迅先生逝世第十三周年纪念日。
    二十二年前，从一九二六年的秋天到一九二七年的春天，我曾经在这个岛上的厦门大学和鲁迅先生同过半年事。在这个短短的期间，就可以指出他在革命斗争上三点伟大的贡献，足以使我们学习和警惕：
    第一、是鲁迅先生革命斗争的坚决性：那时候的厦门大学充满了资本主义、封建主义和买办性、殖民地性的色彩。鲁迅先生和我们一班人，从“三一八”首都革命以后，实在忍不住北洋军阀黑暗势力的压迫，很想找一块清静的地方，暂时躲避起来作学问，于是就接受了林语堂的邀请结伴儿到了厦门。谁知道一到厦门立刻就发现那种氛围简直和我们所想的不对。一班书呆子虽然还想关起门来念书教书，不问外事，富有革命秉性的鲁迅先生可忍不住了。他认为我们不该学“正人君子”的妥协，我们得抱着“党同伐异”的态度和反动势力斗争。他觉得浑朴天真的青年总比一肚子世故的“学者”好的多。所以在这半年里他完全站在青年一方面和反动的思想、委蛇的人物作坚决的斗争。他那时的思想大部分反映在“两地书”里，可以不再赘说。我只想举两件小事来表现他的坚决态度。他第一次拿到厦门大学薪水，四百元的支票，就自己跑到厦门市的“美丰银行”去兑现。商埠的钱鬼子照例眼珠儿往上翻，他们怎看得起一位穿着破灰布棉袍，头发多长的老头儿呢？其中的一个就问“这张支票是你的吗？”鲁迅先生吸了一口烟，还他一个白眼，一语不发；他连问了三次，先生也连吸了三口烟。那张支票倒底在无言的抗议中兑现了。在他将去广州时，厦大校长给他饯行，当时还有些个资本家在座。校长介绍其中一个说：“某某先生是我们的董事。我们私立大学不管别的，谁捐钱谁就可以作董事。”鲁迅先生毫不犹豫地从口袋里掏出两毛钱来往桌上一拍，说：“我捐两毛钱也可以作董事吗？”这又是他一次有言的抗议。
    第二、是鲁迅先生革命斗争的持久性：熟悉中国革命史的人可以知道，有许多先进的斗士起初对于革命也很热烈，可是因为徘徊动摇不能坚定，往往中途变节，不能贯彻初衷。鲁迅先生的革命阶段虽有不同，可是从始至终一直抱着向黑暗斗争的态度，从来没有妥协过。让我再从回忆厦门引一个反面的例。当年在厦大时林语堂还相当的开明，和鲁迅先生站在同一战线。所以当他被迫离开厦大时，我们有些人还对他表同情，和他同去就。一九二七年他从上海到汉口时，我们两三个人还亲自到金利源码头送他上船。大革命失败以后，他因为出卖“吾国与吾民”发了点儿洋财，在上海作寓公，再碰见旧伙伴儿时就问“鲁迅近来怎样了？”词色之间流露着：他已经不和在厦门时一样把鲁迅当作他的革命导师了。抗日末期，他曾从美返国一次，在昆明西南联大讲演时，曾经向人问起：“现在学生还左倾吗？”并且在“宇宙风”上发表了一首平仄不调，具有同样“右倾”意识的歪诗，我回想到厦门，回想到金利源码头，就决定不见他的面。他二次返美以后，发表了一本叫“枕戈待旦”的小书，把重庆一班权奸，从孔祥熙到熊式辉，恭维得叫人浑身起鸡皮疙疸。去年出版的“苏东坡传”甚至于借着苏东坡和王安石的对峙来捧国民党骂共产党。这样一来，他在纽约东河沿上的精美住宅就成了何应钦和Ｃ·Ｃ·走卒的游息之所，一班洁身自好的人更裹足不前了。现在的林语堂当然不能和鲁迅先生相提并论，不过当年他也曾经自命为“斗士”的。由他变节的历程很可给一般革命性不坚定、不持久的知识分子作一面镜子！
    第三、是鲁迅先生革命斗争的发展性：鲁迅先生思想的发展是经过好几个阶段的。瞿秋白在“鲁迅杂感选集”的序言里指出：鲁迅从“进化论进到阶级论，从绅士阶级的逆子贰臣进到无产阶级和劳动群众的真正友人以至于战士。他是经历了辛亥革命以前直到现在四分之一世纪的战斗，从痛苦的经验和深刻的观察之中带着宝贵的革命传统到新的阵营里来的。”由我和他在厦门几个月间的相处，来看他一九二八年加入左翼作家联盟的前后，很可以想见他艰苦思想斗争和严历自我批评的历程。然而鲁迅先生可以永久尊敬的地方，就正在他对于革命有坚苦卓绝、行健不息的发展性。茅盾说：“要善于学习鲁迅，必先明白鲁迅思想发展的道路；鲁迅的思想和作品中，可供我们学习者甚多，但在今天，知识分子特别需要自我改造之时，鲁迅所经历的从进化论到阶级论，从个性主义到集体主义的过程，尤其值得我们注意学习。”
    鲁迅先生是有革命秉赋的，也有坚强持久的斗争性的，可是假使不能随时发现自己的错误，勇于改造自己，朝着正确的鹄的迈步前进，他绝不会在今天得到广大群众的崇仰。知识分子们应该时时学习鲁迅先生行健不息的发展性，同时还得时时拿林语堂一类自甘堕落的人来警惕自己！
    一九四九，十月十九日，参加鲁迅先生逝世十三周年纪念会归来。
