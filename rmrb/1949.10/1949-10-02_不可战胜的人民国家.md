　　Invincible People's Nation
    All the people of China and the world will forever remember October 1, 1949. At the celebration rally in Beijing, the capital of the People's Republic of China, the proclamation of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, announced by Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people, along with the review order of Commander-in-Chief Zhu De of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the grand review of the land, sea, and air forces of the Chinese people, shook the world with unparalleled force. He announced the birth of the People's Republic of China; he announced the establishment of the Central People's Government, the only legitimate government representing the people of the entire People's Republic of China.
    The ideal for which the Chinese people have struggled for a century has become a great reality. The unprecedented great unity of 475 million Chinese people has produced an unprecedentedly strong government of their own. This government, because it was established on the basis of the great victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War and the People's Revolution, led by the Chinese Communist Party, in overthrowing the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang government; because it was established on the basis of the broadest united front formed by all democratic parties, people's organizations, the People's Liberation Army, all regions, all nationalities, overseas Chinese, and other patriotic and democratic elements, and the great unity of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference composed of their representatives; because it is a people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class, based on the worker-peasant alliance, uniting all democratic classes and all nationalities in the country, and adopts a democratic centralism combining legislative and executive powers suitable for the people's democratic dictatorship, it is bound to become the only government in Chinese history that can be warmly supported by the people of the whole country, the only one that can truly unify all of China, the only one that can shoulder the arduous task of building a new China, and the most honest, efficient, and powerful government. The Chinese people have longed for such a government for many years without success, but today they have obtained it. It is only natural that the people of the whole country celebrate the establishment of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China with such joy and excitement. The Chinese people, liberated from the multiple oppressions and long darkness of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, cannot but rejoice to have such a great and wise leader as Chairman Mao Zedong, under whose leadership they will continue to thoroughly defeat all enemies at home and abroad, build an independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, prosperous, and strong new China, and become an important member of the great family of all freedom-loving and peace-loving nations in the world.
    This unprecedentedly popular, unified, and powerful Central People's Government is, of course, the only legitimate government representing the people of the entire People's Republic of China. In the face of the great strength of the Chinese people, who have already achieved great victories and established the nation, any imperialism is powerless. We must immediately warn the political cooks in Washington and London: you no longer need to play with your already tattered diplomatic "menu." Your attempt to use the United Nations General Assembly as your voting machine, indulging the fugitive Jiang Tingfu to rant and rave in the General Assembly, slandering the great Chinese people and their great ally, the Soviet Union, in order to interfere in China's internal affairs and instigate war hysteria, is absolutely not permitted by the People's Republic of China.
    The Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek clique was originally just a theft company in China, and it has now completely collapsed. Who still regards it as some kind of "government," insists on including its absurd "accusations" on the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly and endorses them is deceiving themselves, seeking their own failure, and openly adopting an unfriendly attitude towards the Chinese people, and will bear the consequences arising therefrom.
    Today, with the Central People's Government having been proclaimed established, we, the Chinese people, can be confident that we are now an invincible country. We must quickly mobilize all the forces of the country, implement the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference step by step, realize the great charter of the Chinese people's revolution, strive to consolidate and strengthen the people's armed forces, support the revolutionary war, carry the People's Liberation War and the People's Revolution through to the end, liberate all of China's territory, complete the cause of unifying China, suppress the activities of all counter-revolutionary elements, never slacken our vigilance, and resolutely defend the interests of the people's nation. We must strive to restore and develop existing production, and plan to develop the New Democratic people's economy and cultural and educational undertakings, so as to gradually change the backward agricultural country into a civilized and progressive industrial country. We must closely unite with international friends, learn from the construction experience of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, and actively participate in world political affairs to enhance cooperation between China and the people of all countries and defend world peace.
    Compatriots! The glorious day has arrived, let us contribute everything we have to the great and free motherland!

　　不可战胜的人民国家
    全中国和全世界人民都将会永远记住一九四九年十月一日这一天，在中华人民共和国首都北京的庆祝大会上，由中国人民伟大领袖毛泽东主席所宣布的中华人民共和国中央人民政府公告，与中国人民解放军朱德总司令的阅兵命令和中国人民的陆、海、空军各武装部队的大检阅同时，以无比的巨响震撼着全世界。他宣布了中华人民共和国的诞生；他宣布了代表中华人民共和国全国人民的唯一合法政府——中央人民政府的成立。
    一个世纪以来中国人民奋斗的理想业已成为伟大的现实，四万万七千五百万中国人民的空前大团结已经产生了中国人民自己的空前强有力的政府。这个政府，由于它是在中国共产党领导的中国人民解放战争和人民革命推翻了国民党政府的反动统治、取得了伟大胜利的基础上建立起来的；由于它是在全国各民主党派、各人民团体、人民解放军、各地区、各民族、国外华侨及其他爱国民主分子所结成的最广泛的统一战线及其代表所组成的中国人民政治协商会议大团结的基础上建立起来的；由于它是以工人阶级为领导的、以工农联盟为基础的、团结各民主阶级和国内各民族的人民民主专政，并采取了适合于人民民主专政的议行合一的民主集中制，因此，它就必然成为中国历史上空前未有的唯一能够得到全国人民的热烈拥护、唯一能够真正统一全中国、唯一能够担负新中国艰巨的建设任务的、最廉洁、最有效率和最强有力的政府。中国人民多少年来渴望着这样的政府而不可得，今天得到了。全国人民如此欢欣鼓舞地庆祝中华人民共和国中央人民政府的成立是极当然的，从帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的重重压迫和长期黑暗生活中解放出来的中国人民，不能不庆幸得到毛泽东主席这样伟大英明的领袖，在他的领导下继续彻底战胜一切内外敌人，建设起独立、民主、和平、统一、富强的新中国，成为世界爱好自由和平的各民族大家庭中重要的一员。
    这个空前受人民拥护的统一的强有力的中央人民政府，当然是代表中华人民共和国全国人民的唯一合法的政府。在已经取得了伟大胜利和已经建国立业的中国人民伟大力量面前，任何帝国主义都是无力的。我们要立即警告华盛顿和伦敦的政治厨子们：你们再不必搬弄你们早已破烂的外交“菜单”了，你们妄想把联合国大会作为你们的表决机器，纵容亡命之徒蒋廷黻在大会上胡言乱语，污蔑伟大的中国人民及其伟大的友邦苏联，借以干涉中国内政和鼓动战争的歇斯底里，这是中华人民共和国所决不许可的。
    国民党蒋介石集团本来只是在中国开了一个窃盗公司，现在也已经根本倒闭了，谁还把它当成一个什么“政府”，主张把它的什么荒谬的“控告”列入联合国大会的议程并予以附和，谁就是自欺欺人，自找失败，谁就是公然对中国人民采取不友好态度，并将承当由此产生的后果。
    在中央人民政府业已宣告成立的今天，我们中国人民可以确信：我们已是一个不可被战胜的国家了，我们要迅速动员全国的一切力量，有步骤地实现中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领，实现中国人民革命的大宪章，努力巩固和加强人民武装力量，支援革命战争，把人民解放战争和人民革命进行到底，解放中国全部领土，完成统一中国的事业，镇压一切反革命分子的活动，一刻不要松懈我们的警惕性，坚决保卫人民国家的利益。我们必须努力恢复与发展现有的生产，并有计划地发展新民主主义的人民经济与文化教育事业，以便逐渐改变落后的农业国成为文明进步的工业国。我们必须亲密地团结国际友人，学习苏联及各人民民主国家的建设经验，并积极参加世界政治事务，以增进中国和各国人民的合作，保卫世界的和平。
    同胞们！光荣的日子已经到来了，让我们为伟大的自由的祖国贡献我们的一切！
