　　Starting from "Saving Mom Through Thrift"
    ——Reply to Comrades Tao, Ling, Fan...
    Ya Qun
    I wonder how you feel? After reading the poem "Saving Mom Through Thrift," I not only felt a kind of indescribable and most genuine emotion between working people, but also felt that if I were to write about this subject (saving to help disaster victims), I would inevitably end up with empty, slogan-like content, unable to be intimate and touching. Therefore, doesn't this boil down to a most basic question: Although we also understand the principle of loving working people, our thoughts and feelings are not yet, or not deeply enough, integrated with those of the working people, whereas the author of this poem, because she is a member of the working people herself, plus the progress of her political consciousness, naturally has flesh-and-blood feelings for the peasants, so the voice she emits is so intimate and pure. At the same time, I also feel that the poem "Seeing the People's Republic of China" published in this journal on the 11th is also greatly different from what we write:
    “Under the scorching sun!
    On the freezing snow
    We carry guns on our shoulders
    Just to fight for you.”
    We are all cheering and singing for the birth of the new China, but when we compare ourselves with this commander and fighter of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, how empty and weak our voices seem!
    Of course, I am not saying that because we are not workers, and we have not been soldiers holding guns, we cannot write poetry, or that we cannot write good poetry. I feel that from these concrete examples, it shows that we—aspiring literary workers—still need to go to the workers, peasants, and soldiers more practically to train ourselves, to experience the lives, thoughts, and feelings of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, so that we can more truly, vividly, and powerfully reflect the voice of this great era, and also better serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

　　从“节约救妈妈”说起
    ——并复陶、凌、帆……诸同志
    亚群
    不知你们怎样？我读了“节约救妈妈”一诗，不仅感受到一种难于形容的劳动人民之间的最真切的感情，而且，觉得要是我来写这个题材（节约救灾），一定难免成为空洞的口号化的东西，不能亲切感人。因此，这当中是否存在着这末一个最基本的问题：我们虽然也知道爱劳动人民的道理，但我们的思想感情却还没有，或者还不够深刻地与劳动人民相结合，而这首诗的作者却因为自己就是劳动人民中的一员，加上政治意识的进步，所以她很自然地对于农民有血肉相连的情感，所以发出来的声音是这么亲切，纯真。同时，我还感到十一号本刊发表的“看见中华人民共和国”一首诗，也大大地与我们写的东西不同：
    “在炎热的阳光下！
    在严寒的雪地上
    我们肩上挂着枪
    就是为了你作战。”
    同样是为了新中国的诞生而欢呼，而歌唱，可是我们试与这位中国人民解放军的指战员一比，我们的声音就显得多么空泛无力！
    当然，我不是说，因为我们不是工人，我们没有当过持枪的战士，我们就不能写诗，或者说写不出好的诗，我是觉得从这些具体的例子中，说明了我们——有志于文艺工作者们，还需要更踏实地到工农兵中去锻炼自己，体验工农兵的生活、思想和感情，我们才可能更真切地生动有力地反映出这大时代的声音，也才可能更好地为工农兵服务。
