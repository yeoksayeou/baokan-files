Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 5th -- A Polish patriotic youth rally in support of peace was held in Warsaw on the 1st. Guests attending the rally included delegations from the Soviet Communist Youth League, youth representatives from Czechoslovakia, Romania, Malaya, Iran, Argentina, and Free Germany, as well as the Vice-Chairman of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, Damon. The Vice-Chairman of the Polish Committee for the Defense of Peace, Rabasqui, congratulated the assembly, saying that in the struggle for peace, not only enthusiasm and will are needed, but also wisdom and vigilance. Polish youth defend world peace by defending democracy and their motherland.

　　When the Secretary of the Soviet Communist Youth League, Shelepin, appeared on the podium, the entire audience stood up and cheered "Long Live Soviet-Polish Friendship," "Long Live the Soviet Communist Youth League," and sang the Internationale loudly. Shelepin conveyed the warm congratulations of the Soviet youth to the assembly, and said: "Now, young people all over the world who wish to live and work freely should work even harder to consolidate their ranks and say 'No to War' to the warmongers. We are not begging for peace, but resolutely demanding peace, because we are stronger than ever before."

    【新华社北京五日电】波兰爱国青年拥护和平大会于一日在华沙举行，参加大会的来宾有苏联共产主义青年团代表团、捷、罗、马来亚、伊朗、阿根廷、自由德国的青年代表及世界民主青联副主席达蒙。波兰拥护和平委员会副主席拉巴斯基向大会致贺说：在争取和平的斗争中，不仅需要热情与意志，而且也需要智慧与警觉。波兰青年保卫世界和平，就是保卫民主和他们的祖国。
    当苏联共产主义青年团书记谢利平出现讲坛时，全场起立欢呼波苏友谊万岁，欢呼苏联共产主义青年团万岁，并高唱国际歌。谢利平向大会转达苏联青年的热烈祝贺，并称：现在全世界愿望自由地生活与工作的青年们，应更加努力地巩固他们的队伍，并向战争贩子们说：“不许战争”，我们不是乞讨和平，而是断然要求和平，因为我们比过去更强大了。
