　　Introducing the Beijing Opera Troupe Training Class
　　Meng Geng
　　(I) Overview of the Training Class:
　　The Beijing Opera Troupe Joint Training Class, which began in early August, has now concluded. During this period, it successfully completed its original learning plan. The training class had 502 students from the ballad singing, Ping opera, and national opera (i.e., Peking opera) circles, accounting for 20% of the total number of performers in the city. The vast majority of students were illiterate or had a rudimentary knowledge of writing, but there were also a few who had received university, middle school, or higher elementary school education. These students ranged in age from over sixty to fifty, to thirteen or fourteen years old. There were blind musicians, old literati who wrote scripts and lyrics, front-of-house managers, and shop assistants. Almost all of the students were responsible for supporting their families, working every night, and some even day and night.
　　Due to the uneven levels of education, age, and differences in practical knowledge, the requirements for the course content of the training class also varied; some requested to hear more "political theory," others requested "it's best to be more popular, tell more stories and examples!" Some requested "it's better to talk about materials on how to transform various aspects of the business!" And some requested "in addition to explaining principles, teach literacy!" and so on.
　　Although the training class was organized by themselves voluntarily, and completely voluntary, according to their private discussions and analysis of various reflections, at most a quarter of these students were not truly willing to study. Most came to "check in, get a certificate upon graduation in the future, and make it easier to join a troupe." Some "were afraid of being said to be backward, so they followed along." Some thought "although it's said to be voluntary, I'm afraid I won't be able to get away with not studying in the future, so I'll come to muddle along!" Still others saw that the whole country was about to be liberated "if I don't study here, I'll have to study there; if I don't study now, I'll have to study in the future, so I might as well start early." In short, they were all kinds of different colors, each with their own purpose.
　　Still others were because in the old society, they (performers) had to sing about feudal morality, feudal order, emperors, generals, and ministers in order to eat. Therefore, they were more familiar with the feudal ruling class's set of anesthetizing and deceiving people with the Three Cardinal Guides and Five Constant Virtues, and the Three Obediences and Four Virtues. This bound their minds even tighter, creating a brain full of muddled-along, laissez-faire thinking. The majority did not have a correct understanding of liberation.
　　(II) What to Study and Learning Methods:
　　According to their different levels, different requirements, and their thinking, seeking the opinions of the students, jointly planning and repeatedly researching, it was decided to first break their feudal superstitious thoughts and have a correct view of life: First, talk about the different status of performers in the old and new society, thereby guiding the discussion of outlook on life. To enable them to establish a thrifty and laboring point of view; second, talk about class, enlighten their class consciousness, and from talking about social development, enable them to establish a class point of view. From analyzing "opera," talk about opera for whom? To clarify the policy of opera serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Once the general ideological problem is solved, the knots that bind their thinking are untied, and the direction is clear, then how to rehearse new operas? Learn new lyrics? Adapt old operas? That is just a technical problem of how to do it, and it is easy to solve.
　　For a training class of this nature, the teaching method must first be flexible. Taking lectures as the main method, it is necessary to take care of the overall situation, so that the old, young, high, and low are all interested. Start with analyzing actual examples to lead to the main text, and then from the main text theory to learn the examples. This actually tells us that those with a low level can understand, and those with a high level are also interested, so as not to make everyone distracted in the classroom. The time of each lecture should not be too long, the longest should not exceed one and a half hours. The preparation of materials should be substantial, not only should the outline be researched by several people in advance, but also the specific examples should be thought out. The materials should be concentrated, and many problems should be explained on one point. Do not be verbose, and do not talk too broadly, otherwise the students will sign in and leave without interest, and even "leave the hall" (the jargon means to disperse).
　　In the training class, it is first necessary to discover activists, cultivate backbones, and spend half an hour or several tens of minutes each time to specifically educate group leaders and activists, to give them research on how to conduct the training class, humbly solicit their opinions, from their opinions to understand the situation of all the students, and to give them the core content of the lesson again, so that they can truly understand the core content of the lesson. Each time, call them to take charge of the discussion meeting, and the group leader activists can act as the central speaker, explaining what they understand to the group, so that the discussion meeting invisibly becomes a small lecture hall of "artists teaching artists," so that each student can more deeply understand the problem, and also stimulate the students' enthusiasm.
　　Inviting experts to give special reports, and various agencies sending things and writing letters, also encouraged each student's learning mood. Asking people to teach songs and enliven the classroom were also the main factors for the smooth progress of this training class.
　　(III) Seeing the Harvest of This Training Class from the Students' Learning Experience.
　　Increased class consciousness and clarified the policy of opera serving "workers, peasants, and soldiers":
　　Although the vast majority of the students have very low levels of education, when the study is about to end, those who can write write themselves, and those who can't write dictate to someone to write, all writing their learning experience. Although the writing is almost very simple, they can sincerely say what is in their hearts.
　　Although they didn't have money in the past, they always regarded rich people and readers as superiors and civilized people, and regarded the laboring people and themselves as inferiors, "People respect the rich, dogs bite the poor, whoever has money sings for them." "Practice your voice well, practice your tune well, rich people are willing to watch, and you can earn money." "In order to eat, not afraid of losing face, whoever has money will entertain them, sing opera to earn money to support the family, no matter Zhang San or Li Si, money is good." "People are rich because they cultivated it in their previous life, let's forget about it in this life! Recite Buddha and cultivate the Tao to seek the next life!" and so on. After learning about class issues and the history of social development, they recognized: "After learning, it's like waking up from a big dream. We are all born from poor families. It's really shameful to think about why we are promoting rich people! In the future, we should sing operas about the working people and sing for the laboring people." "I have been singing opera muddledly for decades, and now I understand that we are not toys. Our opera also has a propaganda responsibility. We must make the people look up to us. First, we must eliminate our bad habits and not sing those feudal, superstitious, and lewd operas that are poisonous to the people. Learn new operas, sing for the people, then we are worthy of serving the people, and we will be valued and welcomed by the people." "In the past, we also actively responded to the authorities' call for charity sales to help the victims, but the authorities still called us stinky 'actors,' and being beaten and suffering made people feel disheartened. After liberation, we took a deep breath and called us literary and art workers. There are also our representatives in the Literary Congress. Only under the leadership of the Communist Party will we truly turn over, and there will be such a vigorous and happy new atmosphere. We can only serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers to be worthy of the Communist Party and the people." From the learning experience of hundreds of people, it can be seen that they have almost unanimously recognized the different situations of old and new society old artists, and the direction of personal efforts, and solved the ideological problems that they most urgently need to solve. The majority clarified the policy that opera should serve workers, peasants, and soldiers. Learning changed the style:
　　In the past, when they spoke, they glared and had a bad temper, which caused family discord and quarrels with colleagues on the same stage. They couldn't live a good life and couldn't perform well. After learning, they first reflected on themselves and then criticized others, and then didn't quarrel anymore: "The family colleagues were all happy and harmonious when they met. This is really a good medicine for curing diseases." Many people said this in their learning experience: "Only with criticism can there be unity, and only with joint planning and joint research can the opera be improved and performed well, and there will be strength."
　　From unwilling to learn to willing to learn to helping others:
　　Some students told others what they heard in the training class. They gradually realized: "This training class is not the 'training' of the past. The teachers are all talking from the bottom of their hearts. The more you listen, the more you want to listen."
　　Many students have taken notes from beginning to end, and they have to review and check themselves and correct their mistakes when they get home, and they also tell their neighbors about their learning experience. "Our neighbors also understand new principles." Ma Runshan lived in Tongxian and traveled eighty miles back and forth to listen to the lectures, and then gave a lecture to the Tongxian artists' training class: "Not only did I educate myself, but I also educated others." The father urged his son to listen to the lectures, and after the son finished listening, he advised his father not to be superstitious. This training class has invisibly opened several individual or collective sub-training classes.
　　Learning and business are gradually combined:
　　After liberation, performing old operas gradually became unpopular. I didn't understand why people in Beijing didn't want to watch Beijing operas? After learning, I understood "the principle that people will definitely not want to watch operas that poison the people. After the new opera was performed, there were more seats, proving that the principles of the training class are completely correct." From learning, most students solved this ideological problem. During the learning process, Ping opera and ballad singing circles successively sang many new operas (Peking opera also performed individual new operas); two-thirds of the ballad singing circles have learned new lyrics. Guan Xuezeng already has fifteen or sixteen new tricks, and the Xidan Amusement Center has at least one or two new lyrics every day. The Ping opera troupes are almost the same! It can be said that everyone has performed new operas, and they have put forward the slogan of new opera competition: "See who serves the people well after learning!"
　　When Yin Qingquan compiled the sixth book "Water Margin" after learning, he already saw that the point of view had changed, explaining that the peasant uprisings in history were because the feudal ruling class forced the peasants to have no way to go, there was no place to complain about grievances, and the oppressed peasants united and stood up to justly resist the government. The actual proves that this lecture class did not fall into the air, and some of the students have turned their thoughts into actions, and will play a considerable role in the old opera reform movement.
　　Broke through some sectarian views and presented a united atmosphere.
　　In the past, those who made a living by singing, especially in Beijing, not only between the ballad singing, Ping opera, and national opera industries, but also between the lead roles, supporting roles, and extras, the well water did not violate the river water, and there was no contact. Even among the same opera troupe members, in addition to performing on the same stage, when they arrived backstage, they said "good job," exchanged a few words, and generally left with their boot bags under their arms after the performance. In this training class for two months, regardless of the industry, they were all classmates. Everyone gathered together, and in addition to concentrating on listening to lectures, everyone was very kind to study problems during rest and discussion meetings. Especially when they graduated, Ping opera, national opera, and ballad singing jointly performed, regardless of famous actors, supporting roles, variety shows, and bouncers, they performed on the same stage. Quan Guohua, the head of the ballad singing industry, carried a bench in front of the stage and happily said: "Such a big cooperation is the first time in the history of the Beijing opera industry, and such a grand occasion is also unprecedented!"
　　(IV) A Few Points of Experience
　　Summarizing the two-month artist training class can draw the following points of experience: (1) First, break the artists' muddled thoughts, so that they understand the different status and different tasks of the new and old society, and clarify the policy that opera serves workers, peasants, and soldiers, which is the key to solving the problem. (2) From the shallow to the deep, the materials are concentrated, with many vivid examples and few empty words, and the teaching methods are often changed according to everyone's opinions. (3) Educate and cultivate activists. (4) Write letters of encouragement from all aspects and invite experts to give reports, so that the students can always maintain an excited and happy learning mood. (5) Avoid too long a time, otherwise learning will become a burden. (6) At the end, democratically elect models for continued cultivation, otherwise the lecture will be over after the lecture.
　　No one has experience in starting such a training class. Although there are many gains, it is inevitable that there are many shortcomings. For example, at the beginning, we did not pay attention to cultivating backbones, resulting in a period of slack learning in the middle. Also, most students have gained a lot, but a small number of people still got away with it for these two months. The organization, leadership, supervision, and inspection were also not enough. Although there are these shortcomings, we should pay attention to them when we do it again in the future, but we should definitely say: We have laid a solid foundation for the future reform of opera work. This is just the beginning of reforming the old opera and educating and transforming urban artists. In the future, new literary and art workers and all aspects need to help vigorously. The colleagues in the art world should unite and work hard to continue learning, and everyone should work together to gradually complete the work of reforming the old opera to serve the people.

　　介绍北京戏曲界讲习班
    梦庚
    （一）讲习班情况概述：
    北京的戏曲界联合讲习班从八月初旬开始，至今已结束了。这期间，胜利的完成了原订的学习计划。讲习班有曲艺界、评戏界、国剧（即平剧）界的学员五百零二人，占全市艺人总数百分之二十。学员绝大部分是不识字与粗通文字的，但也有少数受过大学、中学或高小教育的。这些学员有六十多岁的，有五十多岁的，也有十三、四的小孩子。有双目失明的琴师，有编写剧本唱词的旧文人，有前台经理，有小伙计。学员中差不多都是担负着家庭生活，每夜，甚至有的昼夜在工作着。
    由于文化程度不齐，年岁原因及实际知识的差别，对讲习班的课程内容要求也不同；有的要求多听些“政治理论。”有的要求“最好通俗点，多讲点故事例子！”有的要求“还是讲些如何改造业务各方面的材料吧！”还有的要求“除讲道理外，教教识字吧！”等等。
    讲习班虽然是他们自己自动组织的，完全采取自愿；但根据他们的私下议论，各方面的反映分析，这些学员中最多有四分之一还不够真正自愿来学习的，多数是来“点点卯，将来毕业给个证章，搭班好搭。”有的“怕旁人说落后，跟着跑跑。”有的认为“虽然口头说自愿，恐怕将来不学不行，来混混吧！”还有看到全国即将解放“这里不学，那里也得学；现在不学，将来也要学，所以不如趁早吧。”总之是形形色色，各有目的。
    还有是因为在旧社会里，他们（艺人）为着吃饭不得不歌唱封建道德，封建秩序，帝王将相，因此他们对封建统治阶级那套麻醉、欺骗人民的三纲五常，三从四德等，更熟悉。把他们的脑子束缚的更紧，造成满脑子的得过且过糊糊涂涂的思想。大部分对于解放没有正确认识。
    （二）学些什么与学习方法：
    根据他们不同的程度，不同的要求，与他们的思想，征求学员们的意见，共同策划反复研究，决定首先打破他们的封建迷信思想，对人生有个正确的看法：第一步，讲新旧社会艺人不同的地位由此引导讲人生观。使他们建立勤俭劳动观点；第二步讲阶级，启发他们的阶级觉悟，从讲社会发展使他们建立阶级观点，从分析“戏”，讲戏曲为什么人的？使他们明确戏曲为工农兵服务的方针。总的思想问题解决了，解开了束缚他们思想上的扣子，明确了方针，以后如何排演新戏？学新曲词？改编旧戏等，那只是如何做的技术问题，就容易解决了。
    这样性质的讲习班，教学方法首先要灵活。以讲授为主，要照顾到全局，使老、少、高、低都感兴趣，从分析实际例子引上正文，再由正文理论学例说明，这样实际告诉我们程度低的可以听懂，程度高的也感到兴趣，在课堂上不致使大家精神涣散。每次讲课的时间不可太长，最长不要超过一点半钟。准备材料要充实，不但提纲要事先经过几个人研究，具体例子也要想好。材料集中，许多问题集中在一点上说明，不要罗嗦，面不要讲的太宽，否则学员们签个到听着没有趣味就要中途走了，甚至“起堂”（行话即散了之意）。
    在讲习班上首先要发现积极分子，培养骨干，每次抽半个钟头或几十分钟专门进行教育小组长及积极分子，给他们研究讲习班如何进行，虚心征求他们的意见，从他们的意见中可以了解了全体学员的情形，把课的内容中心再给他们讲一遍，使他们可以真正了解课的内容中心，每次讨论会叫他们去掌握，小组长积极分子，可以当中心发言人，把自己了解的，再给小组上讲一遍，这样讨论会无形中变了“艺人教艺人”的小讲堂，使每个学员都能更深刻的了解问题，也能激起学员们的积极性。
    讲专家做专题报告，各机关送东西写信，也鼓舞了每个学员的学习情绪，请人教歌，活跃课堂，这几方面也是使这次讲习班顺利进展的主要因素。
    （三）从学员们的学习心得中看这次讲习班的收获。
    提高了阶级觉悟，明确了戏曲为“工、农、兵”服务的方针：
    虽然学员们绝大部分文化都很低，但学习快结束时会写的自己写，不会写的口述找人写，都写了学习心得。虽文字写的差不多很简单，但都能诚恳的说出自己心里的话来。
    他们过去虽然自己没有钱，但总把有钱人念书人看成是上等人，文明人，把劳动人民与自己看成是下等人，“人敬的是阔的，狗咬的是破的，谁有钱给谁唱。”“嗓子练好，腔调练好，有钱人愿意看，钱就能挣到手。”“为着吃口饭，不怕丢尽脸，谁有钱应酬谁，唱戏挣钱养家吃饭，不管张三、李四，有钱就好。”“人家富是上辈子修下的，这辈子算了吧！念佛修道求下辈子吧！”等等。这些糊涂思想，在学完阶级问题及社会发展史后，他们认清了：“学习后如同大梦初醒，我们都是贫苦子弟出身，想起来真羞耻，为什么给人家有钱的人宣传呢！今后应该唱劳苦人们的戏曲，唱给劳动人民听。”“糊糊涂涂的唱了几十年的戏，现在才了解我们不是玩艺，我们的戏曲还负有宣传责任，我们要叫人民看的起，首先取消自己的坏习气，不唱那些封建迷信淫荡对人民有毒的戏，学习新戏曲，唱给人民听，才佩为人民服务，才会得到人民重视与欢迎。”“过去也积极的响应当局的号召义卖救灾，但当局仍把我们叫臭‘戏子’，挨打受罪真使人寒心，放解后使我们深深的吐了一口气，称我们为文艺工作者，文代会还有我们的代表，只有在共产党领导下我们才会真翻身，才会有这样蓬勃愉快的新气象，我们只有为工、农、兵服务，才对得起共产党，才对得起人民。”从几百个人的学习心得里看出，差不多是一致的认清了新旧社会旧艺人不同的处境，及个人应努力的方向，解决了他们最急须解决的思想问题。大部分明确戏曲应为工、农、兵服务的方针。学习改变了作风：
    过去一说话三瞪眼，脾气暴燥，闹的家庭不合，同台的同行吵嘴，光景过不好，戏演不好，学习后先检讨自己，再批评别人，再不吵架了：“家里同行见了都是欢欢喜喜，和和气气，这真是治病的好药方。”有许多人在学习心得里都这样讲：“只有批评才有团结，只有共同策划、共同研究才会把戏改好、演好，才会有力量。”
    从不愿学到愿学到帮助别人：
    有的同学把讲习班听的讲，讲给别人听。他们逐渐认识到：“这个讲习班不是过去的‘受训’，教员们讲的全是心窝里的话，越听越愿意听。”
    有很多同学都从头至尾的记了笔记，回家后还要复习，检查自己，纠正错误，把学习心得还讲给街房邻居听，“我们的街房也懂了新道理。”马润山住在通县听次讲往返八十里，把听的再给通县艺人讲习班讲一遍：“不但教育了自己，还教育了别人。”父亲督促儿了听讲，儿子听完，劝父亲不要迷信，这个讲习班无形中又开设了若干个人或集体的分讲习班。
    学习与业务逐渐结合起来：
    解放后演旧戏逐渐的不上座，不了解为什么北京人不愿看北京的戏了？学习后明白了“毒害人民的戏，人民一定不愿看的道理。新戏演出后上座多了，证明了讲习班的道理完全是正确的。”从学习中大部分学员解决了这个思想问题。评剧界、曲艺界在学习过程中，相继演唱出很多新的戏曲（国剧也有个别的演出了新戏）；曲艺界已有三分之二的人学会了新词。关学曾已经有了十五六段新玩艺，西单游艺社每天至少有一段至两段的新词，评剧界的班社差不多！可以说是全体都演出了新戏，他们提出新戏竞赛的口号：“看谁学习后给人民服务服的好！”
    尹清泉学习后编第六本“水泊梁山”时已经看出改变了观点，说明了历史上的农民起义，是封建统治阶级逼的农民无路可走，有冤无处诉，被压迫的农民们团结起来挺身而起正义的反抗官府。实际证明了这次讲学班没有落了空，部分的学员已经把思想变成了行动，并将要在旧戏改革运动上起到相当的作用。
    突破了些门户之见，呈现了团结的气象。
    过去，吃饭张口坐艺的，尤其北京，不但曲艺、评剧、国剧各行之间，角、底包（配角）龙套之间，井水不犯河水，素无来往，就是同行艺员除同台演唱外，到了后台“道道辛苦”，寒暄几句，一般的都是胳膊下挟着靴包演完就走，在这次讲习班两个月里，不分行业都是同学，大家同聚一堂，除集中精力听讲外，休息与讨论会上大家都是很亲切的研究问题，尤其表现在毕业时，评剧、国剧、曲艺联合大演出，不分名角、底包、杂耍、蹦蹦，同台演出，曲艺界负责人全国华在前台背凳子，高兴的说：“象这样的大合作是北京戏曲界有史以来第一次，这样盛况也是空前的！”
    （四）经验点滴
    总结两个月的艺人讲习班可以得出下面的几点经验：（一）首先打破艺人的糊涂思想，使他们了解新旧社会不同的地位，不同的任务，明确戏曲为工、农、兵服务的方针，是解决问题的关键。（二）由浅入深，材料集中，多举生动例子，少说空话，根据大家意见经常改变讲课方法。（三）教育培养积极分子。（四）各方面写信鼓励，请专家做报告，使学员们经常保持兴奋愉快的学习情绪。（五）忌讳时间太长，否则学习便变成了负担。（六）结束时民主推选模范继续培养，不然讲完也就完了。
    创办这样的讲习班大家都没有经验，虽然有很多的收获，难免有很多缺点，如开始时没有注意到培养骨干致中途一段学习松懈，还有，是大部分学员有了很大收获，但有少部分人仍是混过了，这两个月，组织、领导、督促、检查也做的不够。虽然有这些缺点，应该今后再办时注意，可是应该肯定的说：我们已为今后改革戏曲工作，奠定了一个坚稳的基础，这还不过是改革旧戏曲，教育改造城市艺人一个开端，今后还须要新文艺工作者及各方面大力的帮助，艺界同人团结一起努力继续学习，大家动手逐步的来完成改革旧戏曲为人民服务的工作。
