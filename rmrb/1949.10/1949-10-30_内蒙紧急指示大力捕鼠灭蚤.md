　　[This News] Since the Inner Mongolia Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government issued an urgent directive on May 28th to strengthen epidemic prevention work in various regions, Inner Mongolia has achieved considerable success in epidemic prevention in terms of improving epidemic prevention institutions, mobilizing the masses to catch rats, preventive vaccinations, and isolation and blockades. However, since August and September, some areas have neglected prevention because they believed that the plague epidemic period had passed; some cadres did not pay attention to epidemic prevention and abandoned leadership; some health cadres relaxed epidemic prevention under the pretext of flood control; in particular, some district and village cadres had serious麻痹 complacency and neither actively took the initiative to carry out epidemic prevention education for the masses, and even adopted a perfunctory attitude towards epidemic prevention work themselves. As a result, the plague occurred successively in Wujiazi, Qianjiadian, Longxingdang, and Dalin districts of Tongliao County, and Naiman Banner and Mingren Banner. In Heitukeng Village, Naiman Banner, 14 people from 7 out of 9 households were infected, and 8 died by September 6. In Longxingdang District of Tongliao County, 29 plague patients occurred in eight villages from September 3 to 19, and 5 died. What is even more alarming is that the spread of pneumonic plague has been found among patients. Now is the season for the prevalence of pneumonic plague in late autumn and early winter, which is likely to cause disaster. To this end, the Inner Mongolia Epidemic Prevention Committee issued an urgent directive on September 23, calling on cadres at all levels to overcome various incorrect understandings of epidemic prevention work, concentrate their efforts on catching rats and eliminating fleas, eradicate the source of infection, and conduct in-depth publicity and education to mobilize the masses in epidemic-stricken villages and villages to make them aware of the seriousness and harm of the plague (especially pneumonic plague), and to admit and isolate patients early to save lives, in order to achieve the purpose of eradicating and stopping the spread of the current epidemic.

　　内蒙紧急指示大力捕鼠灭蚤
    【本报讯】自从五月二十八日中共内蒙党委、内蒙自治政府发出加强各地防疫工作紧急指示后，内蒙各地的防疫工作，在健全防疫机构、发动群众捕鼠、预防注射、隔离封锁等方面均收到相当成绩。但自八、九月以来，因有些地区以为鼠疫流行时期已过，忽略预防；有些干部对防疫工作不重视而放弃领导；部分卫生干部借口防汛忙而放松防疫；特别是部分区村干部存在严重麻痹思想，既不积极主动对群众进行防疫教育，甚而自己对防疫工作也采取应付态度。因而在通辽县五家子、钱家店、隆兴当、大林及奈曼旗、明仁等区鼠疫相继发生。奈曼旗黑土坑屯全屯九户三十七人中，即有七户十四人患病，至九月六日死亡八名。通辽县隆兴当区八个屯子自九月三日至十九日发生鼠疫患者二十九名，死亡五名。更值得警惕的是在患者中已发现肺鼠疫之蔓延，目前又值秋末冬初肺鼠疫流行季节，颇有酿成灾害之虞。为此，内蒙防疫委员会曾于九月二十三日发出紧急指示，号召各级干部克服各种对防疫工作的不正确的认识，集中精力捕鼠灭蚤，根绝病源，深入疫区村屯进行宣传教育发动群众，使之认识鼠疫（特别是肺鼠疫）的严重性与危害性，对患者早期收容隔离，抢救生命，以期达到扑灭及制止目前疫病蔓延之目的。
