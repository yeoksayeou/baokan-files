　　At the Soviet Overseas Chinese Club in Beijing
    The grand ceremony for the establishment of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China had just concluded, and the Soviet government officially established diplomatic relations with our country. Amidst the cheers of the Chinese and Soviet people jointly celebrating friendship and victory, the reporter excitedly visited the Soviet Overseas Chinese Club in Beijing.
    The person in charge, Krachayev, was not at home. A female staff member in the office warmly invited me to sit and chat in the reception room and took me to visit their library and cinema. In a spacious room, she danced happily by herself, which was the place for dancing during festive banquets.
    Another staff member in his thirties cordially shook my hand and said, "The establishment of the People's Republic of China makes us extremely happy. To express our celebration, we drank a lot of wine yesterday."
    At 6:30 in the afternoon, Krachayev and his secretary, Andreyev, arrived in the meeting room on the second floor. The electric lights illuminated the red tablecloth, and the room was filled with an atmosphere of friendship and harmony.
    Andreyev said happily: "The day after the People's Republic of China declared its establishment, the Soviet overseas Chinese in Beijing held a welcome meeting of 150 people to welcome the establishment of the People's Republic of China. That day we shouted many slogans to the Communist Party and Mao Zedong." He continued: "Now there are two major camps in the world, aggression and peace. In the peace camp, the strength of 475 million people has been added. We are really especially happy, especially delighted." Krachayev also expressed his joy at the victory of the Chinese people. He represented more than 250 Soviet overseas Chinese (including children) in Beijing to congratulate the birth of the People's Republic of China. He said: "The Chinese people have suffered from aggression and oppression for a long time. This time, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, they have completed a great revolutionary cause, allowing the deeply troubled Chinese people to gain freedom and liberation. How can we not be particularly happy?" Speaking of the friendly relations between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union, he said: "From now on, the people of our two countries will unite more closely, exert our powerful strength, oppose wars of aggression, and defend world peace." At this point, he repeated that they were particularly happy and particularly welcomed the establishment of the People's Republic of China.
    Also present was Lebeilin, the leader of the Beijing Soviet Overseas Chinese Youth Group, a lively and enthusiastic Soviet youth who is only eighteen years old and speaks fluent Beijing dialect. He said happily: "Our young people are even happier and more delighted. In the past, when we went to school in Beijing, we could not talk freely about the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people. Now we can speak freely." He told reporters that their youth group is preparing to host a certain Beijing literary and art troupe recently. The gifts are some small programs or movies.

　　在北京苏侨俱乐部里
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府成立盛典甫毕，苏联政府正式即与我国建立外交关系。在中苏人民共祝友好共庆胜利的欢呼声中，记者满怀兴奋地访问了住在北京的苏联侨民会俱乐部。
    负责人克拉柴夫不在家，公事房里的一位女职员热情地让我到会客室去坐谈，带我去参观他们的图书馆、电影室。在一座宽敞的房间里，她就独自高兴的舞了起来，那是每逢喜庆筵会时跳舞的地方。
    另一个三十多岁的职员亲切地握着我的手说：“中华人民政府成立了，我们十二分的高兴，为了表示庆祝，我们昨天喝了很多的酒。”
    下午六点半的时候，在二层楼上的会议室里，克拉柴夫和他的秘书安得列耶夫都来了。电灯照耀着红色的桌布，室内充满友谊和谐的气氛。
    安得列夫很高兴的说：“中华人民共和国宣告成立的第二天，我们在北京的苏联侨民就开了个一百五十人的欢迎会，欢迎中华人民共和国的成立，那天我们对共产党、毛泽东喊了很多的口号。”他接着说：“现在世界上有侵略与和平两大阵营，在和平阵营内，现在又增加了四万万七千五百万人的力量，我们真是特别的高兴，特别的欢喜。”克拉柴夫也特别表示了他对中国人民胜利的欢欣，他代表在北京的二百五十余名苏侨（包括小孩子）庆贺中华人民共和国的诞生。他说：“中国人民过去长期受着侵略和压迫，这一次在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，完成了伟大的革命事业，使灾难深重的中国人民获得自由解放，我们怎能不特别高兴呢？”谈到中苏两大民族友好关系时，他说：“从今以后，咱们两国人民将更加紧密的团结在一起，发挥我们强大的力量，反对侵略战争，保卫世界和平。”至此，他又重复了一遍他们对中华人民共和国的成立特别欢喜，特别欢迎。
    同时在座的北京苏联侨民青年组组长列别林，是一个活泼而热情的苏联青年，今年才十八岁，说着一口流利的北京话，他愉快地说：“我们青年更欢喜，更高兴，过去我们在北京上学，不能随便谈中苏人民的友好，现在我们能自由地说话了。”他告诉记者，他们青年组准备最近招待北京某文艺工作团，礼物是一些小的节目或电影。
