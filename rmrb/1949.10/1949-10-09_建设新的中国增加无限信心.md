　　【Beijing News】The joyous news that the Soviet Union was the first to establish diplomatic relations with us has stirred up another wave of cheers in the capital, which has been celebrating wildly for days. At the same time, it has increased infinite confidence in the rapid success of the construction of the new China and the striving for lasting world peace.
　　The Propaganda Department of the 70th Arsenal printed a special edition of the "70th Life Small Newspaper" and distributed it to various departments. People read it one after another during busy production, or several people crowded together to read it. Someone said, "Hey, the Soviet Union is definitely our good friend!" Yang Wenzhi, who had been a hired laborer for many years, said, "This is really a great happy event. The Soviet Union recognized our Central People's Government first. These two great countries, with vast territories and large populations, will surely guarantee world peace when they unite!" Liu Jingyuan, a fitter, filed while saying, "With a good friend like the Soviet Union, the construction of our country is no problem."
　　Upon hearing this good news, all the workers of the Second Telephone Bureau immediately happily sang the national anthem and the Internationale and launched a heated discussion. Old Meng said, "We must work hard to learn from the Soviet elder brother, improve our production, catch up with them, and join hands with them to move towards a bright future and eliminate all reactionary forces."
　　Wang Chengli, a worker in the water meter section of the Water Company, saw the two giant portraits of Stalin and Chairman Mao printed in the newspaper, along with the big headline "The Soviet Government Officially Recognizes Our Country," and danced with joy. When everyone came to ask him, he loudly and happily said, "The Soviet elder brother has recognized our country, and ambassadors will be exchanged immediately." Everyone jumped up with joy upon hearing this.
　　The staff and students of the Revolutionary University were also jubilant. That morning, when Ai Siqi lectured on the history of social development, he announced the news to everyone. Eight thousand cadres and students were overjoyed, and the applause lasted for several minutes. In the evening, a "Celebration of the New Sino-Soviet Diplomatic Relations Conference" was held. At this conference, Vice President Hu first said: The Soviet Union's first recognition of our Central People's Government as the only legitimate government is another great assistance to us in consolidating victory and engaging in construction work. With the world's peace forces led by the socialist Soviet Union, plus the birth of the great People's Republic of China, the close cooperation between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union provides a new guarantee for world peace. In the future, we must work harder to learn from the Soviet Union, quickly do a good job in construction, and move from new democracy to socialism quickly and steadily. Heads of various departments and representatives of students from various departments spoke successively, expressing their gratitude for the friendship of the Soviet Union and their confidence in construction, and wishing the two great leaders of the people, Marshal Stalin and Chairman Mao, good health.

　　建设新的中国增加无限信心
    【京市讯】苏联第一个与我建立外交关系的喜讯，使这几天整日狂欢的首都，又扬起了一片欢呼。同时对新中国建设迅速成功及争取世界持久和平，更增加了无限的信心。
    七十兵工厂宣教部“七十生活小报”曾印出号外，发到各所，在忙碌的生产中一个人看完了又传给下一个人；或几个人挤在一起看。有人说：“嘿，苏联到底是咱们的好朋友！”干了多少年的长工杨文治说：“这真是一件大喜事，苏联先承认了咱们的中央人民政府，这两个大国家地大、人众，团结起来，世界和平一定有保障！”钳工刘景元他拿着锉刀一边锉活一边说：“我们有了苏联这样的好朋友，我国的建设是不成问题了。”
    电话二局全体工友们，一听到这个好消息，马上高兴地唱起国歌和国际歌来，并热烈展开了讨论。老孟说：“我们要努力向苏联老大哥学习，提高我们的生产，迎头赶上他们，和他们手拉着手，走向康庄大道，消灭一切反动势力。”
    自来水公司水表股工人王成立一眼看到报上印着斯大林和毛主席的两幅巨像，和“苏联政府正式承认我国”的大标题，高兴得手舞脚蹈，当大家都来忙着问他时，他大声高兴地说：“苏联老大哥已经承认我国了，马上就要互派大使了。”大家听了都高兴得跳起来。
    革大工作人员和同学们也是欢欣鼓舞。当天早晨，艾思奇讲社会发展史时，把这个消息向全体宣布，八千干部、学员欢欣若狂，掌声雷动，达数分钟之久。晚上，举行了“庆祝新的中苏外交关系大会”。在这个大会上，胡副校长首先讲话说：苏联首先承认我们的中央人民政府为唯一的合法的政府，这对于我们巩固胜利与从事建设工作，又是一种伟大的援助。有以社会主义的苏联为首的世界和平力量，再加上伟大的中华人民共和国的诞生，中苏两大民族的亲密合作，使世界和平得到一种新的保障。今后，我们更要努力向苏联学习，很快地把建设搞好，加快地，稳步地由新民主主义走向社会主义。各部首长和各部学员代表相继讲话，一致表示对苏联友谊的感谢和对建设的信心，并祝福两位人民伟大的领袖、斯大林大元帅和毛主席的健康。
