　　“Ideological Problems”
    Mang Yin
    After more than two months of planning, preparation, and deliberation, our political class has begun.

    Our political class is beginning with a plan, steps, and leadership, with the ultimate goal of transforming ideology and solving problems. Our learning method is not dogmatic, but combines with reality and our own thoughts; our learning style is not singular, but proceeds from various angles at any time and any place.

    Under this policy, our large class began. Our first lesson was not a report, not a speech, but a performance of a play - "Ideological Problems."

    This play narrates that, when Beiping was first liberated, a group of new students entering China University came from various places, possessing various ideological types. These people brought different ideas from various different environments. In order to concentrate revolutionary forces, these ideas must be transformed; and in the three months of life at China University, the facts have proved to us that these ideas can be transformed. The play further illustrates that this kind of ideological transformation needs to be carried out in actual life experience, and more importantly, it relies on the power of the collective.

    This play is a mirror. In the "Ideological Problems" discussion group, students began to bravely confess themselves. In this mirror, the original form of their thinking was pointed out, thereby further realizing the importance of political study and ideological transformation.

    In this discussion, it was discovered that many students still had the idea of ​​"pure technical viewpoint," believing that as long as technology is well learned, it can serve the people, and political study is dispensable. This idea was immediately proven to be wrong. Many students specifically stated that in this year's summer factory internship, many technicians who had not been reformed did not have a correct outlook on life. Therefore, their enthusiasm was not as good as that of the workers, and they could not cooperate with the workers to exert greater power. This is a great loss to the people. If we do not actively improve our understanding now and clarify our thinking, we will make the same mistakes in the future.

    The attitude of belittling labor, the free and undisciplined style, the perfunctoriness of things, the feeling of distress because of being busy or ordinary at work. All these mistakes were brought up in the group meeting. And once they are raised, we will help each other, check each other, and correct them in our daily lives in the future.

    One student was moved after seeing the story of the retired military officer in the play handing over his privately hidden weapons after ideological transformation. He confessed that he had participated in the Three People's Principles Youth League and had been an instructor in the reactionary army. He said, "This time, I handed over a gun hidden in my thoughts."

    Our political class started like this. Although we lack experience, we have plans and confidence. We want to create new learning methods in collective discussions, and cultivate in political classes strong forces to serve the people and build a new democratic country.

　　“思想问题”
    忙音
    经过两个多月的计划准备和酝酿，我们的政治课开始了。
    我们的政治课是在有计划、有步骤、有领导之下开始的，最终的目的，是改造思想，解决问题。我们的学习方法不是教条的，而是和现实和自己的思想结合起来的；我们的学习方式不是一种的，而是由各个角度随时随地进行着的。
    在这样的方针下，我们的大课开始了。我们的第一课，不是报告，不是演讲，而是演出一个剧本——“思想问题”。
    这剧叙述了在北平刚解放时，由各处进入华大的一批新同学中，有着各种各样的思想典型。这些人由各种不同的环境中带来了不同的思想。为了集中革命的力量，这些思想是必须改造的；而在华大三个月的生活中，事实给我们证明了这些思想是可以改造的。剧中更说明了这种思想改造需要在实际的生活体验中进行，更重要的是要靠集体的力量。
    这个剧是一面镜子。在讨论“思想问题”的小组会上，同学们开始勇敢地坦白自己。在这面镜子里指出了自己思想的原形，从而更进一步认识到政治学习、思想改造的重要性。
    这次讨论中发现了不少同学还存在着“纯技术观点”的想法，认为只要技术学好，便可以为人民服务，政治学习是可有可无的。这种思想立刻就被证明了是错误的。很多同学具体地说出了在今年暑假的工厂实习中，许多没有经过改造的技术人员，他们没有正确的人生观，因此，他们的积极性不如工人，同时也不能与工人合作，发挥更大的力量。这对人民是一种很大的损失，我们假若现在不积极的提高认识，将思想搞通，将来是会犯同样的错误的。
    轻视劳动的态度，自由散漫的作风，对事情的敷衍，以为工作繁忙或平凡而感到苦闷。这种种错误都在小组会上提出了。而且一经提出，我们将会在以后的日常生活中互相帮助，互相检查，改正它们。
    一位同学看了剧中退伍军官在思想改造以后交出了私藏武器的故事后被感动了，他坦白地说出了以前曾参加过三青团活动，并在反动军队中当过教官的事情。他说：“我这一次，是交出了思想上暗藏着的一枝枪。”
    我们的政治课就这样的开始了。虽然我们缺乏经验，但是我们有计划，有信心。我们要在集体的讨设中创造新的学习方法，要在政治课中培养起为人论民服务，成为新民主主义国家建设的坚强力量。
