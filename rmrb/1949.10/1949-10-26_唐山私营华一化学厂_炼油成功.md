Tangshan Private Huayi Chemical Plant
	Successfully Refines Oil
	[This Newspaper's Dispatch] The private Huayi Chemical Plant in Tangshan City, after more than six months of research, is now able to refine gasoline, kerosene, and glycerin from vegetable oil. Encouraged by the People's Government's policy of developing industry, young technician Yu Fengwu and others used cottonseed oil and other vegetable oils, lime, "fire soil" (土 produced) and other locally produced raw materials, as well as the convenience of coal and electricity, to refine the above three products starting last December. By October 11th of this year, they had begun shipping their products. The test results show that the quality of the refined kerosene, gasoline, and glycerin is good. In addition, technician Yu Fengwu and others also used cottonseed hulls to manufacture a catalyst for refining crude oil - activated carbon. Activated carbon has many uses and was mostly imported from foreign countries in the past. The factory will manufacture it in large quantities to supply the needs of various regions.

　　唐山私营华一化学厂
    炼油成功
    【本报讯】唐山市私营华一化学厂，经六个多月的研究，已能由植物油提炼汽油、煤油和甘油。青年技师于凤梧等于去年十二月，在人民政府发展工业政策的鼓励下，利用棉籽油及其他植物油、石灰、火土等土产原料及煤、电的便利，提炼上述三种成品，到今年十月十一日都已开始出货。试验结果，炼出的煤油、汽油、甘油质量都好。此外，于凤梧技师等，并用棉籽皮制造了提炼原油用的一种接触剂——活性炭。活性炭用途很大，过去多自外国输入，该厂将大量制造，供给各地需要。
