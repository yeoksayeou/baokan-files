　　Japanese Democratic People
  　Oppose Police Rule in Schools
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 24th] TASS, Pyongyang, 20th: A dispatch from Tokyo indicates that reactionaries are retrogressing within Japanese educational institutions. Japanese Minister of Education Takase stated on the 18th: The Japanese government "will take all necessary measures to restrict political activities within educational institutions nationwide." According to Takase, the Ministry of Education intends to prohibit all student activities. Journalists point out that these measures by the Japanese government and the American occupation authorities are mainly directed at democratic elements among teachers and students in Japanese educational institutions. The Japanese democratic public is resolutely protesting against the reactionaries' attempt to revive the police rule over educational institutions during the Tojo era. Numerous protests of this kind emphasize that the measures taken by the Japanese ruling group and the American authorities regarding the prohibition of political activities by teachers and students constitute a great violation of the Potsdam Declaration and the relevant decisions of the Far Eastern Commission regarding policies toward Japan.

    【新华社北京二十四日电】塔斯社平壤二十日讯：东京消息显示，反动派正在日本教育机关内倒行逆施，日文相高濑十八日说：日本政府“将采取一切必要措施，以限制全国教育机关内的政治活动”。据高濑说，文部省打算禁止一切学生界的活动。新闻界人士指出：日本政府和美国占领当局的这种措施，主要地是针对日本教育机关教职员和学生中的民主分子。日本民主公众坚决地抗议反动派复活东条时期对教育机关实行警察统治的企图。无数这一类的抗议强调：日本统治集团和美国当局关于禁止教师和学生政治活动所采取的措施，乃是对波茨坦宣言及远东委员会对日政策有关决定的极大破坏。
