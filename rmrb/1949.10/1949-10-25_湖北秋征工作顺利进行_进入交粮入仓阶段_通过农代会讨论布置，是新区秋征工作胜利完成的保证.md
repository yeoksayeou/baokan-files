Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 24th: Hubei Province, with the exception of a small mountainous area in Enshi Prefecture still occupied by remnant bandits, has now successfully entered the stage of grain delivery and storage for the autumn grain collection. After the autumn grain collection began, local landlords, despots, and bandits colluded to spread rumors and sabotage, attempting to obstruct the people's government's reasonable burden policy and the peasant movement, and to transfer the burden to the peasants. Therefore, the first step in the autumn grain collection work in various regions was to expand publicity, using local examples familiar to the peasants, and various forms such as distributing leaflets, posting cartoons, and holding mass meetings to explain the reasonable burden policy, so that the landlord power holders could not easily carry out their tricks of deceiving the masses and transferring the burden. At the same time, mass suppression of bandits was launched successively in Huanggang, Daye, Mianyang, Yichang and other prefectures. In Jingshan, Jingzhou Prefecture, militia organizations were established to defend against bandits and ensure the smooth progress of the autumn grain collection.

According to the experience of various regions, conducting autumn grain collection through discussions and arrangements at farmers' representative conferences is an important step to ensure the smooth completion of autumn grain collection. However, the organization of the farmers' congress must be pure, and its representatives should be active elements who are fair and just among the peasant masses. Those peasant activists who have been cultivated patiently by cadres who personally go to the countryside to conduct in-depth publicity, or representatives who have been discovered and selected by these activists, can play an active role in the autumn grain collection. Conversely, those appointed by old Baojia chiefs or elected without leadership are actually controlled by landlords and despots and cannot complete their tasks. After establishing preliminary contact with the masses through the farmers' congress and publicity campaigns, the autumn grain collection work in most areas has adopted a method of focusing on breakthroughs to promote the overall situation. For example, the Mianyang, Huanggang, and Daye special commissioner's offices all designated key villages to arrange the autumn grain collection in advance to gain experience. Before the start of the autumn grain collection in Mianyang, a group of cadres was sent to conduct key experiments, and then they went to work in various villages. As soon as there were results, they widely disseminated the experience through meetings and newspapers, giving full play to the role of key villages.

During the autumn grain collection preparation work in various regions, mobilizing the masses to investigate and uncover a large number of black fields hidden by landlords and despots greatly reduced the burden on the peasants. The black fields investigated in the 25 Bao of the Chengguan District of Macheng County accounted for three times the number reported by themselves. In one Bao in the Chengguan District of Xishui County, more than 12,000 *shi* of black fields were discovered in two days. The amount of public grain to be paid for the concealed fields discovered in one village in the Chengguan District of Anlu County accounted for 60 percent of the total public grain to be borne by the entire village. After the peasants discovered the concealed fields and reduced their burdens, they immediately launched a warm grain delivery movement.

At present, although the autumn grain collection work in Hubei Province has achieved preliminary results, there are still significant deviations: cadres in individual regions are eager for quick results and have a tendency to be impatient in their work. In order to complete tasks and win championships, they use methods of hanging and detaining people, causing serious mistakes of being divorced from the masses. In some places, the policy of reasonable burden is not firmly grasped, or the class division is not clear, and middle peasants are classified as rich peasants, making the burden on middle peasants too heavy. The Hubei Provincial People's Government has issued a notice to various regions to strictly correct these deviations.

　　湖北秋征工作顺利进行
  　进入交粮入仓阶段
    通过农代会讨论布置，是新区秋征工作胜利完成的保证
    【新华社汉口二十四日电】湖北全省，除恩施专区的一小块尚为残匪盘驻的山地外，秋季征粮工作现已胜利进入交粮入仓阶段。秋征开始后，各地地主恶霸与土匪特务勾结一起，造谣破坏，企图阻止人民政府的合理负担政策和农民运动，把负担转嫁给农民。因此，各地秋征工作第一步即进行扩大宣传，从农民熟悉的当地实例，用发传单、贴漫画、开大会等各种形式，说明合理负担政策，使地主当权派不易再进行其欺骗群众转嫁负担的诡计。同时，在黄冈、大冶、沔阳、宜昌等专区，先后展开了群众性的剿匪工作，在荆州专区的京山，民兵组织起防匪自卫，保证了秋征工作的顺利进行。
    根据各地经验，通过农民代表会的讨论布置，以进行秋征，是保证秋征工作顺利完成的重要步骤。但农代会的组织必须纯洁，其代表应是农民群众中为人公正的积极分子。凡是经过干部亲自下乡深入宣传，耐心培养起来的农民积极分子，或经过这些积极分子发现物色的代表，都能在秋征中起积极作用。反之，由旧保甲长指派或无领导选出的，实际上都为地主恶霸所控制，无法完成任务。通过农代会及宣传运动，与群众建立了初步联系以后，各地区秋征工作多半采取了重点突破推动全盘的方式。如沔阳、黄冈、大冶专署都规定了重点村，提前布置秋征取得经验。沔阳开征前就派了一批干部进行重点实验，然后再分赴各村工作，一有成效，即通过会议报纸广泛传播经验，发挥重点村的作用。
    各地秋征准备工作中发动群众查出了大量地主恶霸隐藏的黑田，大大减轻了农民的负担。麻城县城关区二十五保查出的黑田，占自报数的三倍，浠水县城关区一保，两天内查出一万二千余石黑田。安陆县城关区一个村查出的瞒田应缴公粮数，占全村应负担公粮的百分之六十。农民在查出了瞒田，减轻了负担后，马上展开了热烈的交粮运动。
    目前湖北省秋征工作，虽已取得初步成绩，但仍存在着很大的偏向：个别地区的干部急于求成，工作有急性病倾向，为了完成任务，夺取锦标，用吊打扣押的办法造成脱离群众的严重错误。有些地方对合理负担政策掌握不紧，或阶级划分不明确，把中农划成富农，使中农负担过重。对这些偏向，湖北省人民政府已通令各地严加纠正。
