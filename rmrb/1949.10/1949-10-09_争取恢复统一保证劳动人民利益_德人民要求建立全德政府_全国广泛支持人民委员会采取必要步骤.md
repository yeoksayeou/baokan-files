Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 8th: According to a TASS report: Proposals demanding the establishment of an all-German democratic government continue to flow from workers, staff, farmers and intellectuals throughout Germany to the German People's Council. The Central Bureau of the Christian Democratic Union of East Germany held a meeting in Berlin on the 5th, resolving to urge all members to actively participate in the preparatory decisive stage of Germany's post-war development, the purpose of which is: to restore Germany's unity, elect a German National Assembly, form a German government, conclude a peace treaty and withdraw the occupying forces. The Central Committee of the Miners' Union, representing 200,000 East German miners, submitted their demand to the People's Council to establish an all-German government in Berlin, and guaranteed that they "are willing to cooperate with an independent German government and fully support it." The Central Committee of the Metalworkers' Union, representing 2.5 million German metalworkers, submitted their proposal to the People's Council for the establishment of an all-German independent government, and their resolution pointed out: "The Bonn government is not the government of the German people, it is an agency of foreign conquerors. Our metalworkers have restored their enterprises and taken these industries into their own hands, not to send them out to these conquerors. Therefore, we demand the establishment of a real German government, with Berlin as its capital, representing the interests of all Germany, and guaranteeing the fundamental interests of all working people." Ten thousand workers of the Electrical Chemical Company in Bitterfeld declared in their resolution: "Germany should advocate a government that maintains peace, not a government that works for the creation of war. Therefore, we demand the abolition of the government of the Bonn splitters and the establishment of an independent government for all of Germany in Berlin. We request the German People's Council to immediately take appropriate decisions, and we will give it our greatest support." Employees of the Stralsund "People's Shipyard" passed a resolution emphasizing the need to establish an independent and democratic all-German government in Berlin. The German Democratic Women's League recently issued a statement saying: "We women - members of the German Democratic Women's League - advocate the unity of Germany, because only through unity can we have a guarantee of peace. We express our support for the demand of all progressive German people to immediately establish an all-German government in Berlin. We women - members of the German Democratic Women's League - call on women throughout Germany to support the demand for the establishment of an all-German government." In West Germany, according to a DDP report on the 7th, the response to the decision to form an all-German government in Berlin is also increasing day by day. Voting conducted in factories, offices and shops in Düsseldorf shows that not only workers, but also most staff, merchants and even small industrialists are deeply moved by the actions of the German People's Council. Christian Democratic Union staff member Braem said: When the all-German government is established, Adenauer's government of industrialists and bankers will lose its significance. Another spokesman declared: "Germany cannot exist without economic unity, and when the free government in Berlin appears, the German workers will know which side they should stand on." In a large factory in Wuppertal, not a single worker opposed the free government in Berlin. News from West Germany says that there has never been as much attention paid to East German radio as in the past few days.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 6th: TASS, Berlin, 5th: Recently, the demand for the establishment of an independent and democratic all-German government among people from all walks of life in Germany has become more and more prominent and widespread.

Employees of many enterprises in Berlin and the Soviet occupation zone of Germany resolved to demand that the German People's Council, the only legitimate all-German representative body, take all necessary steps for this purpose. These just demands of the working people to prevent the threat to the survival of the German people caused by the divisive policies of the Western occupying countries and the Bonn Quislings have been supported by all democratic parties and mass organizations in the Soviet occupation zone.

The Central Committee of the Free Democratic Party held a meeting in Leipzig on October 3, putting forward the demand for the establishment of an all-German government with Berlin as its capital. The party passed a resolution stating: "Germany has been divided economically and politically for four and a half years, and a peace treaty has not yet been concluded, and it is now in a serious national disaster. The establishment of a separate state in the western part of our country and the implementation of occupation regulations threaten to turn this disaster into a national catastrophe. In order to prevent this, the responsibility of all German people now is to stand up and act for the interests of the whole of Germany, and put forward the demand for the establishment of a unified national state and the German Democratic Republic. Only the all-German constitution drafted by the German People's Council and unanimously adopted by the German People's Congress can become the constitution of a unified Germany. A unified democratic republic will be strong and full of confidence on the basis of this constitution."

On October 3, Heikmann, chairman of the Christian Democratic Union of Saxony, issued a statement in Dresden saying that the Christian Democratic Union supports all efforts to reunify Germany under an all-German democratic government. He also said that if the German People's Council calls for preparations to establish an all-German government with Berlin as its capital, the Christian Democratic Union will do everything possible to facilitate the achievement of this task.

On October 5, the National Daily published a statement by Bolz, Chairman of the German National Democratic Party and Chairman of the Presidium of the German People's Council, saying: "We, the National Democrats, adhere to the goal of achieving unity and independence for our German motherland and our German people, and demand the immediate establishment of an all-German government with Berlin as its capital."

Baum, the first chairman of the Democratic Peasants' Party, declared that the Democratic Peasants' Party supports the establishment of an all-German democratic government. The separate government in West Germany was established by the order of the Western occupying countries, and it does not conform to the interests of the German people. Baum pointed out: "Only by establishing an all-German government can Germany obtain a complete, independent and fair peace treaty."

Dietz, Chairman of the Free German Trade Union Federation of Greater Berlin, and Onnack, Chairman of the Free German Youth League, also demanded the establishment of an all-German government. All the working people in the entire Soviet occupation zone and Berlin have put forward this demand.

According to a DDP report, on the 3rd and 4th, thousands of factories, enterprise workers and democratic organizations in East Germany passed resolutions demanding the unification of Germany and the establishment of an all-German front. These include the German Democratic Women's Federation, the Former Political Prisoners League, etc.

　　争取恢复统一保证劳动人民利益
    德人民要求建立全德政府
    全国广泛支持人民委员会采取必要步骤
    【新华社北京八日电】据塔斯社报道：要求建立全德国民主政府的提案，继续不断地从全德各地工人、职员、农民与知识分子中流向德国人民委员会。东德基督教民主联盟中央局五日在柏林举行会议，决议敦促所有盟员积极参加准备德国战后发展的决定性阶段，这个阶段的目的是：恢复德国的统一，选举德国国民议会，成立德国政府，缔结和约与撤退占领军。矿工联合会中央委员会代表二十万东德矿工，向人民委员会提出他们在柏林建立全德政府的要求，并保证“愿与独立的德国政府合作，并对它全力支持。”金属工人联合会中央委员会代表二百五十万德国金属工人，向人民委员会提出他们建立全德独立政府的建议，他们的决议指出：“波恩政府不是德国人民的政府，它是外国征服者的机关。我们的金属工人恢复了他们的企业，把这些工业掌握到自己的手里，并不是要把它们送出去给这些征服者的。因此，我们要求建立真正的德国政府，以柏林为首都，代表全德国的利益，并保证一切劳动人民的根本利益”。比特费尔德的电气化学公司一万工人在其决议内宣称：“德国应主张保持和平的政府，而不是为制造战争工作的政府。因此，我们要求取消波恩分裂者的政府，而在柏林建立全德的独立政府。我们请求德国人民委员会立即采取适当的决定，我们将予以最大力的支持”。斯特拉尔逊特“人民船坞”的职工通过决议，强调必须在柏林建立独立民主的全德政府。德国民主妇女联盟最近发表声明称：“我们妇女——德国民主妇女联盟的会员主张德国的统一，因为只有统一，我们才能有和平的保证，我们表示支持一切进步德国人民立即在柏林建立全德政府的要求。我们妇女——德国民主妇女联盟的会员号召全德国的妇女支持建立全德政府的要求”。在西部德国，据电通社七日电称，对于在柏林成立全德政府的决定的响应，也正日益增多。杜塞尔多夫的工厂、办公室与商店中所进行的投票显示，不仅是工人，而且大部分职员、商人甚至小工业家，都深深地为德国人民委员会的行动所感动。基督教党职工会人员布来麦声称：当全德政府成立，阿登纳的工业家与银行家的政府就将失掉意义。另一个发言人声称：“德国如果没有经济上的统一就不能存在，同时当柏林的自由政府出现时，德国的工人们会知道应该站到哪一边”。在乌泊特尔的一家大工厂里，没有一个工人反对柏林的自由政府。来自西德的消息称：那里从来没有象过去几天那样注意东德的广播。
    【新华社北京六日电】塔斯社柏林五日讯，最近以来，德国各界人民中间对建立全德独立民主的政府的要求，已愈来愈显著和广泛了。
    柏林及德境苏占区许多企业的员工决议要求唯一合法的全德代表性机构德国人民委员会，为此目的采取一切必要步骤。劳动人民这些防止西方占领国家及波恩吉斯林分子的分裂政策所造成的对德国人民生存威胁的公正要求，已得到苏占区一切民主党派和群众团体的支持。
    自由民主党中央委员会于十月三日在莱比锡举行会议，提出建立以柏林为首都的全德政府的要求。该党通过决议称：“德国在经济与政治上分裂为时已四年有半，仍未订立和约，现已处于严重的民族灾祸中。在我们祖国西部成立分立的国家，实施占领法规，有使这一灾祸变成民族大难之势。为了防止这一点，全体德国人民现在的责任就是起来为整个德国的利益而行动，提出建立统一的民族国家和德意志民主共和国的要求。只有德国人民委员会起草的并经德国人民代表大会一致通过的全德宪法，才可以成为统一的德国的宪法。统一民主的共和国以这个宪法为其基础，将强大而充满信心。”
    十月三日，萨克森州基督教民主联盟主席海克曼在德累斯登发表声明说：基督教民主联盟支持德国重新统一于一个全德民主政府之下的一切努力。他并说，若德国人民委员会号召筹备建立以柏林为首都的全德政府，基督教民主联盟将尽一切办法便利这一任务之达成。
    十月五日，国民日报发表德国国家民主党主席及德国人民委员会主席团主席博尔茨的声明说：“我们，国家民主党人，信守为我们德意志祖国和我们德国人民取得统一与独立的目的，要求立即建立以柏林为首都的全德政府。”
    民主农民党第一主席鲍姆声明民主农民党支持建立全德民主政府。西德分立的政府是奉西方占领国家之命建立的，它不符合德国人民的利益。鲍姆指出：“只有建立全德政府，德国才能得到完整、独立与公正的和约。”
    大柏林自由德国职工会联合会主席狄特及德国自由青年联盟主席昂纳克也要求建立全德政府。全苏占区和柏林的全体劳动人民都提出这个要求。
    另据电通社讯：三四两日东德已有数以千计的工厂，企业的工人与各民主社团通过决议，要求统一德国并成立全德阵线的要求。其中包括德国民主妇女联合会，前政治犯联盟等。
