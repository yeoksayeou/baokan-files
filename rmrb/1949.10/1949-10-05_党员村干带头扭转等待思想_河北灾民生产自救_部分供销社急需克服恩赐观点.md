[Baoding Dispatch] The various disaster areas in this province are making efforts to carry out production for disaster relief. Tangshan Prefecture has transferred more than a thousand cadres to the countryside. Many county and district leading organs have convened symposiums of experienced farmers, or symposiums of labor models and village cadres, to absorb, exchange, and disseminate disaster relief experience. The cadres sent to the countryside to organize disaster relief first fully mobilized village cadres, party members, and activists, and through them reversed the negative and pessimistic emotions of some disaster victims, and quickly carried out various productions. Gradually, they improved their confidence in self-reliance through production. They have come up with ways to solve the current and partial livelihood problems, and on this basis will solve the future and all livelihood problems. For example, in Nancaigakou, Gaoyang, after the village was flooded, the Chinese Communist Party branch of the village grasped the key to self-reliance in production, actively publicized it to the masses, broke the mentality of simply waiting for relief and pessimism, and took the initiative to weave cloth, sell fish, and make shoes with the masses. Therefore, the livelihood of the whole village was guaranteed. In the third district of Hejian, many farmers have launched a mutual aid and mutual assistance movement. At the same time, local governments have loaned a large amount of relief grain and funds to farmers for production, and supply and marketing cooperatives have purchased the finished products produced by disaster victims at high prices and sold raw materials to disaster victims at low prices, opening up a way for disaster victims to make a living. For example, the Anxin Supply and Marketing Cooperative has specially set up a shipyard to manufacture a large number of new ships and repair broken ships to help more than 6,000 fishermen in their production. The Jingxing Supply and Marketing Cooperative helped disaster victims contract to smash stones, solving the livelihood of 10,000 people for more than three months. However, some supply and marketing cooperatives have not exerted their greatest strength in helping disaster victims. They only focus on the supply of daily necessities, and have not done enough to supply raw materials for sideline industries and handicrafts and to promote finished products. Some still have a serious mentality of bestowing favors. For example, in the key supply and marketing cooperative of Boye, there is no limit to the number of purchases by members, forming the situation that one person joins the cooperative and the whole family are members. Some also lack a serious and responsible spirit towards the masses. For example, the Wen'an Supply and Marketing Cooperative purchased 120,000 catties of sorghum, which became hot in the warehouse. Because they were bothered by the trouble of moving the grain, they sold it at 20 percent lower than the market price to everyone regardless of whether they were members, allowing private merchants to make a lot of profit from it.
    Under the leadership of party and government organs at all levels and village cadres and party members, the vast number of farmers in non-disaster areas have launched a "bowl of rice" movement and resettlement of disaster victims with a high spirit of fraternity. For example, Huzhan Town in Tianjin has resettled 64 households of disaster victims, proactively helping them repair houses, borrow furniture, and engage in joint production with them, and letting the disaster victims' products be sold first. Many disaster victims feel that there are relatives everywhere in the liberated areas. In this month, about 150 organs, groups, factories, and schools throughout the province have donated 300,000 catties of rice and 20 million yuan of RMB, and many other materials, all of which have been used to help disaster victims.

  　河北灾民生产自救
    部分供销社急需克服恩赐观点
    【保定电】本省灾区各县正努力开展生产救灾。唐山专区曾抽调千余干部下乡。很多县区领导机关，召开了老农座谈会，或劳动模范、村干座谈会，吸取、交流和传播了救灾经验。下乡组织救灾的干部，到村后首先充分发动村干部、党员和积极分子，通过他们扭转了部分灾民的消极悲观情绪，迅速开展了各种生产。逐步提高了生产自救的信心。想出办法解决了目前的和部分的生活问题，并将在此基础上解决将来的和全部的生活问题。如高阳南蔡家口被水淹后，该村中共支部党员抓住了生产自救的关键，积极向群众宣传，打破了单等救济和悲观情绪，主动与群众插伙织布、卖鱼、做鞋，因此全村生活有了保证。河间三区很多农户开展了互助互济运动。同时，各地政府大批救济粮款已贷与农民生产，供销社以高价收买灾民生产成品，低价售给灾民原料，给灾民开辟生财之道。如安新供销社为扶助六千余户渔民生产，特设了造船厂，大量制造新船与修理破船。井陉供销社帮助灾民包砸石子，解决了一万人三个多月的生活。但部分供销社还没有发挥扶助灾民的最大力量。只偏重于生活必需品的供给，对供给副业手工业原料与推销成品，尚作的不够，有的尚存有严重的恩赐观点。如博野的重点供销社，社员购货没有限制，形成一人入社全家都是社员。有的还缺乏对群众认真负责的精神。如文安供销社所购十二万斤高梁，在仓库中发了热，因嫌倒仓麻烦，就不问是否社员，一律低于市价百分之二十出售，使私商从中取利不少。
    非灾区在各级党政机关及村干部党员的领导下，广大农民以高度友爱精神掀起了“一碗米”运动和安置灾民。如天津糊站镇安置了六十四户灾民，主动帮助他们修房子、借家具，与他们合伙生产，并让灾民的生产品优先出售。许多灾民感觉到在解放区到处是亲人。这一月全省各地机关、团体、工厂、学校，约有一百五十个机关，已捐米达三十万斤，人民币两千万元，其他物资甚多，均已救济灾胞。
