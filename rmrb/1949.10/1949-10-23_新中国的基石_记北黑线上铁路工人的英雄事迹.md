　　The Cornerstone of New China
　　——Remembering the Heroic Deeds of Railway Workers on the Beihei Line
　　Yang Shuo

　　I. A Daunting Task

　　On the northern Manchurian border of Heilongjiang, there is a railway line from Bei’an to Heihe. It runs through the Inner Khingan Mountains, climbing hills and crossing rivers, stretching over three hundred kilometers, and is both treacherous and steep. This was a military line specially built by the Japanese invaders a few years earlier for their invasion of the Soviet Union. After the Japanese defeat, the railway was badly damaged. Bridges were blown up, many steel rails were thrown into the bottom of the Heilongjiang River, and locomotives were overturned on the mountainsides. From Sunwu northward to Heihe, the wilderness was littered with railway materials, buried under thick snow and ice.

　　In early April 1949, just as the ice was thawing and the roads were muddy, more than one hundred railway workers went deep into Heihe. They carried grain and tools on their shoulders, and even more so, a daunting task. At that time, North China had been completely liberated, and there was an urgent need to repair railways and start construction. Further, it was necessary to lay railways forward with the development of the victory, to support the People's Liberation Army's southward advance, and to liberate all of China. But where would the materials come from? The Northeast took on the important task of supporting the interior. Every piece of iron and every screw had a certain weight for the birth of New China. How could so much material on the Beihei Line not be collected? Therefore, the damaged lines had to be repaired first, and then the materials could be transported out. A group of workers started repairing from Bei'an northward. The difficulties were great enough, but the one hundred or so workers who went deep into Heihe to repair from north to south encountered even more thorny problems.

　　II. The Iron in the Heihe Must Also Be Salvaged!

　　Speaking of the Heihe side, the mountains were high and the weather was cold, the population was sparse, and the fields were covered with weeds as tall as a person. The workers cut down the grass and built shacks, sleeping on the grass at night. When it rained, the roofs leaked and the ground was damp, making it impossible to sleep. The horseflies were also numerous, especially large, and could bite through two layers of handkerchiefs covering the face. No one cared about this hardship. The worry was that the materials were difficult to collect. The workers swore as if they were making a vow: "The iron in the Heihe must also be salvaged!" At this time, the river was still frozen, and at noon, when it warmed up, a layer of water would melt, with ice underneath the water and water under the ice. The workers' enthusiasm was like fire, not caring about the cold, they rolled up their trousers and jumped into the water to break the ice. When they first got into the water, they could still feel the pain in their legs from the ice, but after a while, they became numb. When they came up, their legs were pale and white, and it took five or six minutes for the blood to circulate, and they couldn't feel it even when pinched. After breaking the ice, everyone rolled up their sleeves and jumped into the water to lift the iron, one by one, salvaging more than three hundred steel rails.

　　III. Climbing the Mountain Path at Shanshenfu

　　West of Heihe there was a branch line, twenty-eight kilometers long, leading to Shanshenfu. Two very new locomotives were lying there. At first, only two tunnels were seen on this line, and it was thought that the railway could pass through them, but the tunnels were badly collapsed and could not be used. The mountain was quite steep, how could these two locomotives be transported over the mountain? Everyone stared blankly. This was the people's own property, and the country needed it urgently. They could skip meals and sleep, but the locomotives had to be taken out! The workers cherished the property of the country more than their own lives, how could they bow their heads? At the meeting, everyone came up with ideas. After turning around the mountain for three days, they finally found a place where the mountain was relatively low and had a gentle slope, where they could build a railway to transport the locomotives. Without surveying instruments, they only used their eyes to guide them. They drove stakes in the front and started working noisily in the back. In April, the sunny side of the mountain began to thaw, and the ground was muddy, and their shoes were ruined. The grass was deep and the trees were dense on the mountain. Their cotton-padded coats were torn, and the cotton was stuck to their bodies like snowflakes. Everyone took out the clothes and shoes they had brought, and whoever's clothes were torn wore them. In the end, there was not a single pair of shoes left, and they all worked barefoot. The workers did not complain at all, and encouraged each other: "If it's cold, work harder! You won't be cold when you sweat!" Finally, the roadbed was completed. You see, the road rises and falls with the mountain, rising and falling, falling through eighteen bends before crossing the mountain at Shanshenfu.

　　It was time to lay the rails. Sleepers and other materials were all in Heihe, and it was another trouble without flatcars to transport them. The workers' wisdom was like a spring, flowing stronger and stronger. They looked around the mountain and found some car wheels. They tied a few ties between the two wheels and laid the iron rails horizontally, which was just enough to replace the flatcars for transporting things. Everyone worked hard, and in sixteen days, they laid this climbing road. Just as they were about to drive the train, they realized that there was no coal, and the locomotive still couldn't move. To transport coal from Bei'an, the road was muddy and the cars couldn't travel, and it would take half a month for a large cart to make a round trip. There was an old coal mine near Aigun, and some of the workers had worked in coal mines, so they temporarily became the mine managers. With the help of the local garrison and government, more than two hundred soldiers and farmers joined in, and soon a thousand tons of coal were mined.

　　The two dead locomotives were fired up, came to life, and slowly climbed up and down the climbing road. The roadbed was a little sunken, so they used ties to pad it. The driver was afraid of an accident, and said to the people beside him: "If I die, I'll die alone, you all go down!" But who would give up their responsibility and go down casually. In this way, the two locomotives were finally pulled out of the deep mountains. In order to commemorate this arduous project, the workers called this road the "Shanshenfu Climbing Road."

　　IV. Laying the Cornerstone for New China

　　Then they began to repair the road from Heihe to the south. South of Sunwu there was a Zhenqing River, and the railway went around and around the river, with thirteen bridges, and eleven of them were badly damaged. The workers looked for wood in the mountains to repair the bridges. The trees nearby had been cut down, so they had to walk three or four miles to cut wood. They wanted to float the wood down the river, but the new wood was heavy and sank to the bottom of the water. As a result, they had to carry it back one trip at a time. The bridge was repaired, and the road was leveled. The workers who repaired the road swept the road clean, for fear of damaging the bare feet of the comrades who were laying the road. From April 9th, the enthusiasm of all the workers never diminished. They worked in shifts day and night, and finally, on July 18th, the north and south sides were connected, and the vehicles and materials abandoned in the deep mountains were continuously transported out. There were more than 39,000 steel rails, 60 steel beams, 26 locomotives, and 431 passenger and freight cars. All of these supported the front line's advance and the construction of the railways in the interior. By September 22nd, all the materials laid on the road had been withdrawn. The workers returned to Qiqihar, their clothes torn into cotton threads, their hair and beards disheveled, the beards of people in their thirties were more than an inch long, and their hands and feet were covered with injuries. Their spirits were particularly high, as happy as soldiers who had won a battle. This was indeed a victory. They used their labor enthusiasm and wisdom to overcome various difficulties, rescued a large amount of national wealth, and laid a solid cornerstone for the birth of New China.

　　新中国的基石
    ——记北黑线上铁路工人的英雄事迹
    杨朔
    一、艰巨的任务
    北满黑龙江的国境线上，从北安到黑河有条铁路，穿过内兴安岭，爬山过水，三百多公里长，又险又陡。这是早几年日寇为了侵苏，特意修的军用线，日寇一败，把铁路破坏的不成样子。桥梁炸了，好些钢轨扔到黑龙江底，机车翻到山坡上，从孙吴往北顶到黑河，一百多哩的荒山野坡上，遍地扔的是铁路器材，埋着厚厚的冰雪。
    一九四九年四月初旬，刚化冻，路正泞，一百多铁路工人深入到黑河去了。他们肩上背着粮食工具，更背着个艰巨的任务。原来当时华北已经全部解放，迫切需要修复铁路，动手建设，更需要随着胜利的发展，朝前铺设铁路，支援解放军南下，解放全中国。可是器材从哪来呢？东北就负起了支援关内的重要任务。每一块铁，每一个螺丝钉，对新中国的诞生都有着一定的分量。北黑线上这样多的器材怎能不搜集起来呢？这就得首先把破坏的线路修好，然后才能运出器材来。一部分工人动手从北安往北修，困难够大了，但是那一百多深入黑河的工人要从北往南修，遇到的事就更辣手。
    二、黑河的铁也要捞出来！
    单说黑河那面，山高天寒，人烟稀少，漫野净是一人多高的杂草。工人们砍倒草，搭起窝棚，黑夜铺着草睡。一下雨，上漏下湿，就别想睡了，瞎虻又多，特别大，拿两层手巾蒙着脸，也能咬透。这点苦，谁还在意？愁的是器材不好收拾。工人们象发誓似的说：“黑河的铁也要捞出来！”这时大江还冻着冰，晌午头暖和，化一层水，水下面是冰，冰下面又是水。工人们的热情象火，哪管冷不冷，挽起裤子跳到水里刨冰。刚下水还知道冰的腿痛，过了一阵就麻了，上来的时候，腿拔的漂白漂白，五六分钟过不来血，捏也不痛。刨开冰，大伙又挽了衣裳跳进水里抬铁，一根一根，前后捞出三百多根钢轨。
    三、山神府爬山道
    黑河往西有条支线，二十八公里长，通到山神府。山神府那边卧着两台很新的机车。先只看见这条线上有两个山洞，以为铁路可以穿过去，谁知洞子塌的厉害，不能通过。山挺险，怎样才能把这两台车越过山弄出来？大伙瞪眼了。这是人民自己的财产，国家正要用它，饭可以不吃，觉可以不睡，机车却非拿不可！工人们爱惜国家的财产比爱自己的命都厉害，哪肯低头？开会大家出主义，绕着山转了三天，最后发见一块山势比较矮，是个慢坡，可以从那修４铁路，运过机车来。也没带测量镜，光使眼睛照料着，前面打桩，后面闹烘烘地动起工来。四月间，阳坡有点开化，地发泞，鞋插烂了。山上草又深，树又杂，棉袄挂破了，棉花象大雪片子贴在身上，大伙就把带的衣裳鞋子都拿出来，谁破了谁穿，末尾一双鞋也没有，都光着脚干。工人们可丝毫也不叫苦，互相鼓励道：“冷就加紧干啊！出了汗就不冷了！”最后把路基修成。你瞧那路顺着山势上挫下挫，上挫下挫，挫了十八道弯，才翻过了山神府那座山。
    该铺轨了。枕木等器材都在黑河，没有平车运，又是个麻烦。工人们的智慧就象泉水，越流越旺。绕着山找，找到些车轱轳，两个轱轳当间绑上几根道木，横搁上铁轨，正好代替平车运东西。大伙一上劲，十六天工夫便铺好了这条爬山道，正要开车，这时才发现没有煤，机车还是不能动。要从北安运煤去，路泞，汽车不能走，大车来往一趟就得半月。附近瑷珲有个旧炭矿，工人当中又有在煤矿待过的，就临时当了矿长，依靠着当地驻军和政府的帮助，二百多战士和农民加进来，不久便开了一千吨煤。
    两台死机车升上火，活了，顺着爬山道慢慢地爬上爬下。路基有点陷，使枕木垫。司机怕出事，对旁人说：“死就死我一个人，你们都下去！”可是谁肯放弃责任，随便下去。就这样，两台机车到底从深山拉出来了。工人们为了纪念这段艰苦的工程，便叫这条路是“山神府爬山道”。
    四、给新中国奠下基石
    于是开始从黑河往南修路。孙吴以南有条镇清河，铁路顺着河绕来绕去，有十三道桥，当中十一道桥破坏的乱七八糟。工人们可山摸岭找木材修桥，近处的树早砍光了，只好走出三四里地砍木头。想顺着河放，不想新木头重，都沉到水底去了。结果还得一趟一趟往回抬。桥修好，路垫平，修路的工人把路扫的溜干净，生怕搁坏铺路同志们的光脚。从四月九号起，全体工人的热情始终不减，白天黑夜轮着班干，终于在七月十八号南北两边接轨了，丢弃在深山里的车辆器材源源不断地运出来。约有钢轨三万九千多根，钢梁六十孔，机车二十六台，客货车四百三十一辆。……所有这些，全部支援了前线的进军，建设了关里的铁道。赶到九月廿二号连铺在路上的器材也都撤出来了。工人们回到齐齐哈尔，衣裳破成棉花缕，头发胡子乱蓬蓬了，三十几岁人的胡子也有一寸多长，手脚净是伤。他们的情绪却特别高，好象战士们打了胜仗那样高兴。这确实是个胜仗。他们正是用了自己的劳动热情和智慧战胜了各种困难，抢救出了大批的国家财富，给新中国的诞生奠下了一块坚固的基石。
