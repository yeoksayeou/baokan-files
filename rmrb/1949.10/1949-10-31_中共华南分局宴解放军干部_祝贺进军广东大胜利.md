　　Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 30th. The CCP Central South China Bureau and the Guangzhou Military Control Commission hosted a banquet on the evening of the 28th to celebrate the military and political cadres of the People's Liberation Army marching into Guangdong. The banquet was personally presided over by General Ye Jianying, Secretary of the CCP Central South China Bureau and Director of the Guangzhou Military Control Commission, and General Fang Fang, Third Secretary of the Bureau. Those present included: General Chen Geng, Commander of a certain Corps of the Second Field Army, General Deng Hua, Commander of a certain Corps of the Fourth Field Army, Political Commissar General Lai Chuanzhu, and General Lin Ping, Commander of the Guangdong-Xiangxi-Ganbian Column, and more than 200 people. General Ye Jianying delivered a short speech during the banquet. He briefly stated: "Since our army marched south from Jiangxi in separate routes, Guangzhou was liberated in two weeks, the Liangyang (Yangjiang and Yangchun) area was liberated in three weeks, and we reached the edge of the South China Sea, completely annihilating four enemy armies and one corps headquarters attempting to flee to Hainan Island, and quickly achieved a glorious victory. This victory is the result of the wise leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, the leaders of the Chinese people. It is also inseparable from the cadre comrades present today, all of our commanders and fighters who fear no hardships and strive forward, and the military and civilians of Guangdong who have wisely persisted in the struggle and actively supported the southward march!" General Ye raised his glass to celebrate the great victory of this march. Then he pointed out: "We must never be satisfied with the current victory. Today, Guangdong Province has not yet been completely liberated, and Guangxi, Taiwan, as well as Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Kang, and Tibet have not been liberated either. The remaining bandit troops of Jiang, Li, and Bai have not been completely eliminated, and our long-term arduous construction work is just beginning. Furthermore, we must not forget that Guangdong was the first place where imperialism invaded China, and the forces of imperialism entered through the gap in the Pearl River Delta. We must sweep away these remaining evil forces from this gap, consolidate our national defense, and carefully guard the gate of the People's Republic of China. At the same time, we must never be arrogant or lax, but continue to work hard, harder, and carry the revolution through to the end, and move forward to liberate all of China and build a new democratic China."

    祝贺进军广东大胜利
    【新华社广州三十日电】中共中央华南分局、广州市军事管制委员会，于二十八日晚欢宴向广东进军的人民解放军军政干部。宴会由中共中央华南分局书记广州市军管会主任叶剑英将军，分局第三书记方方将军等亲自主持。到会者有：第二野战军某兵团司令陈赓将军，第四野战军某兵团司令邓华将军，政治委员赖传珠将军及粤湘赣边纵队司令林平将军等二百余人。叶剑英将军席间发表简短演辞。略称：“此次我军由江西分路南下以来，两个星期解放了广州，三个星期解放了两阳（阳江、阳春）地区，打到南海边缘，全歼企图逃窜至海南岛的敌人四个军及一个兵团部，迅速地获得了光辉的胜利。这个胜利，是中国人民领袖毛泽东主席、朱总司令的英明领导的结果。也和今天我们在座的干部同志们，和我们全体不畏艰辛奋斗前进的指战员们，和我们英明坚持斗争与积极支援南下大军的广东军民们，是分不开的！”叶将军举杯祝贺此次进军的大胜利。接着他又指出说：“我们绝不要以目前的胜利为满足。今天广东全省还未完全解放，广西、台湾以及云贵川康藏也都未解放，蒋、李、白等残余匪军还未彻底消灭，我们长期的艰苦的建设事业，才正在开始；并且，我们不要忘记：广东是帝国主义侵入中国最早的地方，帝国主义势力就是从广州三角洲这个缺口里打进来的，我们要把这些残余的恶势力从这个缺口扫除出去，要巩固我们的国防，好好地看守这个中华人民共和国的大门。同时我们绝不要有任何骄傲和松懈，要继续努力，再努力，将革命进行到底，为解放全中国，为建设一个新民主主义的新中国向前迈进。”
