Invited to attend were journalists from Beijing newspapers and news agencies, as well as correspondents stationed in Beijing from Tianjin and Shanghai newspapers, and the head of the Soviet TASS News Agency's Beijing branch, Rogov, totaling more than ten people.

In reading the farewell speech to the Chinese people, Simonov sincerely said: In the next few days, we will be leaving the borders of the People's Republic of China, which has treated us so warmly. At this moment, we would like to express our gratitude, through the help of the Chinese press, to the workers, peasants, and People's Liberation Army soldiers who warmly and sincerely welcomed us in various parts of China. We would like to express our gratitude to all Chinese social figures. We express our deepest gratitude to Chairman Mao Zedong of the People's Republic of China. In answering questions from reporters, Simonov repeatedly expressed his deep feelings and confidence in the construction cause of the Chinese people. Most of the reporters asked about the impressions of the Soviet Cultural, Art, and Science Workers Delegation's visits to many cities and rural areas, schools and factories in the new China. Simonov answered these questions very excitedly, saying: The people's democratic culture of the new China has entered the ranks of the world's advanced culture. We are heartily satisfied with the great victory won by the Chinese people. He also said: Although we are about to leave the borders of the new China, we do not think that the mission of our delegation has been completed. We will do everything possible to tell the vast Soviet people about the profound impressions we have gained here.
