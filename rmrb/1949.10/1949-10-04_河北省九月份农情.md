　　Agricultural Conditions in Hebei Province in September
    In September, the main situation in the rural areas of Hebei Province was that the broad masses of farmers victoriously carried out the autumn harvest and prepared for wheat planting in all aspects; in the disaster areas, a production campaign to overcome the famine was launched. Currently, the province is carrying out the autumn plowing and wheat planting campaign.
    In the middle of last month, the Hebei Provincial People's Government issued instructions on autumn harvesting and protection. All counties and districts made specific arrangements, and many counties transferred a large number of cadres to the countryside. Under the leadership of party and government cadres at all levels, the broad masses of farmers widely organized mutual aid, with women and children universally going to the fields, and a mass autumn protection campaign was launched, enabling the autumn harvest work to be completed smoothly in most areas. Except for the disaster areas, the crop yields in most areas were about 70% of a normal year. It is particularly worth mentioning the bumper harvest of the province's huge cotton fields, which exceeded the planting area of the past few years. The cotton harvest in the suburbs of Shijiazhuang was over 80%, and the cotton fields in Gucheng County increased production by more than 340,000 jin compared to last year. The average cotton harvest in the central and southern regions was over 70%. The province's cotton fields, covering 9,926,680 mu, are estimated to produce 720 million jin of seed cotton, excluding the disaster areas.
    During the autumn harvest, party and government cadres and agricultural technicians in various places went deep to mobilize farmers to select seeds in the fields. Ren County used the "comparing harvest" method to promote this work in various villages. In the eighth district of the fourth district, more than 900 households carried out seed selection. In Mancheng's third district, village cadres fully utilized the role of key members in leading seed selection, and more than 1,000 households in 15 villages carried out seed selection. Local experience has proven that fully mobilizing the backbone forces such as village cadres and party members, and using actual examples from the village to mobilize, is the most effective method for leading farmers in seed selection.
    Some areas launched mass production summary campaigns during the autumn harvest. For example, the Handan area universally launched "checking production and comparing crops." Xiaowan Village in Jize County found that Li Jingmei's crops grew the best. His deep plowing, meticulous cultivation, and application of more fertilizer were recognized by the villagers, who pointed out that they should learn from him and compete with him. The Baoding area notified all counties to select excellent agricultural products in order to hold agricultural exhibitions after the autumn harvest. This practice of educating the masses with the masses' production and struggle experience will have a huge significance for launching a large-scale production campaign next year.
    Simultaneous with the autumn harvest, farmers in various places actively prepared for wheat planting in all aspects. In many areas, the universal organization of mutual aid and the participation of a large number of women in the autumn harvest enabled the delivery of manure and plowing to proceed smoothly. For example, in Handan's counties, under the slogan of "compare manure piles this year, compare wheat piles next year," statistics from 33 villages in 18 districts of Jize, Guangping, and Daming counties showed that the number of manure pits increased from 40,600 to more than 54,000, with a total of 160,308 cartloads of manure accumulated. Farmers in various villages in Yi County universally helped military families to compress fertilizer. Farmers in the Xingtai area not only accumulated a lot of fertilizer but also plowed the land an extra time. During the autumn harvest, farmers in various places seized the time to deliver manure, plow the land, and prepare seeds.
    In the disaster areas, wheat planting is one of the central links in overcoming the famine through production. All counties are seizing the leadership in drainage. According to statistics from eight counties including Changping, Tianjin, and Jianguo, a total of 181 drainage ditches and 28 outlets were dug, freeing more than 1.8 million mu of submerged land. In the Cangxian area, the principles of small interests subordinate to large interests, downstream subordinate to upstream, old depressions subordinate to new depressions, and low-lying areas subordinate to high-lying areas were correctly implemented, draining and freeing 4.44 million mu of land, accounting for 85% of the submerged area. To solve the difficulties of wheat planting for disaster victims, most flood-stricken counties universally launched mutual aid, mutual borrowing, mutual exchange, and free lending. For example, the vast majority of disaster victims in the Tongxian area solved the problem of wheat seeds through this method. For a small number of severely affected villages and households in difficulty, the supply and marketing cooperatives lent wheat seeds. Experience has proven that mobilizing the masses for mutual aid, mutual exchange, mutual borrowing, and free lending is the most effective way to solve the difficulty of wheat seeds. Mobilizing mutual aid and mobilizing women to go to the fields are the only effective ways to solve the shortage of manpower and animal power in wheat planting. At the same time, under the help and leadership of supply and marketing cooperatives and party and government cadres at all levels, various sideline productions were launched in the disaster areas to implement the policy of self-reliance through production, and the vast majority of farmers have a high degree of confidence in overcoming the famine. In order to complete wheat planting and increase wheat field production, in addition to leading farmers to work hard from all aspects, governments and supply and marketing cooperatives have prepared a large number of seeds, fertilizers, and arsenic, which are lent and exchanged with farmers. According to incomplete statistics from 11 counties including Wucheng, Boye, and Tang County, as well as the Nangong Office of the Xingtai area supply and marketing cooperative, 580,000 jin of wheat seeds, nearly 5 million jin of fertilizer, and hundreds of jin of arsenic have been prepared. At the same time, the method of exchanging wheat for cotton was adopted in various places, which also solved part of the farmers' wheat seed difficulties. In order to increase wheat field production, in addition to preparing a large number of excellent varieties in various counties, many counties launched seed soaking campaigns. The experience is that village cadres and party members must first learn the seed soaking method, and then take the lead in promoting it, using practical experimental results to educate farmers.
    Currently, the wheat planting campaign in the province has begun. To prevent wheat planting from affecting cotton planting, the Handan Prefectural Party Committee and Commissioner's Office have issued instructions, and counties such as Huolu and Boye have achieved unified planning. However, various places still need to widely publicize and call for more cotton land to be retained; and the cotton price policy should be resolutely implemented to ensure the interests of cotton farmers, so as to lay the foundation for cotton planting next year.

　　河北省九月份农情
    九月份，河北省农村的主要情况，是广大农民胜利进行了秋收，并从各方面准备了种麦；在灾区则开展了生产渡荒运动。现全省正在开展秋耕种麦运动。
    上月中旬，河北省人民政府发出了秋收护秋工作指示，各县区均作了具体布置，不少县份抽调大批干部下乡，广大农民在各级党政干部领导下，广泛的组织互助，妇女儿童普遍下地，并掀起群众性的护秋运动，使绝大部分地区，秋收工作顺利完成。除灾区外，大部地区年景约在七成上下。特别值得提出的，是超过数年来种植面积的全省巨量棉田的丰收。石市郊区棉花收成在八成以上，故城棉田比去年增产三十四万余斤，中南部地区棉花平均可收七成以上，全省棉田九九二六、六八○亩，除灾区外估计可产籽棉七亿二千万斤。
    在秋收中，各地党政干部、农场的技术人员，都深入发动农民进行了田间选种，任县各村用“比收成”办法进行推动，四区八个村有九百余户进行了选种。满城三区由于村干部在领导选种中充分发挥了骨干分子的作用，十五个村有千余户进行了选种。各地经验证明，充分动员起村干、党员等骨干力量，以本村实际例子进行动员，是领导农民选种最有效的方法。
    有些地区在秋收中开展了群众性的生产总结运动。如邯郸专区普遍展开了“检查生产比庄稼”。鸡泽肖湾村比出村民李景梅的庄稼长的最好，他的深耕细作多施肥被全村农民所认识，纷纷指出向他学习和竞赛。保定专区通知各县，选择优良农产品，以便秋收后举办农业展览会。这种以群众的生产、斗争经验教育群众的作法，这对明年开展大生产运动将有巨大的意义。
    与秋收同时，各地农民以各方面积极准备了种麦。不少地区由于普遍组织了互助和广大妇女的参加秋收，使得送粪、耕地得以顺利进行。如邯郸各县，在“今年比粪堆，明年比麦堆”的口号下，鸡泽、广平、大名等县十八个区又三十三个村统计，粪坑由四万零六百个增到五万四千多个，可积粪十六万三百零八车。易县各村农民曾普遍帮助军属压肥。邢台专区农民不但积下很多肥料，并且都做到多翻一遍地。在秋收当中，各地农民都抓紧了送粪、犁地、备种。
    在灾区，种麦是生产渡荒的中心环节之一。各县均抓紧了领导排水。据昌平、天津、建国等八县统计，共挖排水沟一百八十一道、顺水口二十八处，脱出被淹土地一百八十余万亩。沧县专区，正确执行了小利服从大利、下游服从上游、老洼服从新洼、低地服从高地原则，排水脱地四百四十四万余亩，占淹地面积百分之八十五。为解决灾民的种麦困难，大部水灾县份，普遍发动互助、互借、互换和自由借贷。如通县专区绝大多数灾民，依靠这个办法解决了麦种困难。少数重灾村、困难户，由供销社贷放了麦种。经验证明：发动群众互助、互换、互借和自由借贷，是解决麦种困难最有效的办法。发动互助，发动妇女下地，是解决种麦中人畜力缺乏唯一有效的办法。同时，在各级供销社和党政干部帮助领导之下，灾区开展了各种副业生产，以贯彻生产自救方针，绝大多数农民对渡荒具有高度的信心。为了完成种麦和麦田增产，各地除领导农民自己从各方面努力外，政府、供销社均准备了大批种籽、肥料、信石等，贷换给农民。仅据武城、博野、唐县等十一县供销社及邢台专区供销社南宫办事处等不完全统计，就准备了麦种五十八万斤、肥料近五百万斤、信石数百斤。同时各地采用麦子换购棉花的办法，也解决了农民一部麦种困难。为了麦田增产，各县除准备了很大一部分优良品种外，很多县份开展浸种运动。经验是：村干、党员首先须学会浸种方法，然后再带头推动，以实际试验效果，教育农民。
    目前全省种麦运动已经开始，为使种麦不影响种棉，邯郸地委和专署已发出指示，获鹿、博野等县均做到统一计划。但各地尚须广泛宣传，号召多留棉地；并应坚决贯彻棉价政策，保证棉民利益，以打下明年种棉基础。
