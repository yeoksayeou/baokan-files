　　Marxism and Literature and Art
　　Compiled by Zhou Yang
　　This book is compiled according to the spirit of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." This talk constitutes an important part of this book and is also its guiding thread. This book selects comments and opinions on literature and art from Marx, Engels, Plekhanov, Lenin, Stalin, Gorky, Lu Xun, and Comrade Mao Zedong, and divides them into five series according to content: 1. Literature and art of ideology, 2. The nature of literature and art, 3. Literature and art and class, 4. Proletarian literature and art, 5. Writers and critics. A central idea running through the book is: literature and art come from the masses and must go to the masses. This is also the central idea of ​​Comrade Mao Zedong's speech, and his greater contribution is that he has solved the problem of how literature and art should go to the masses in the most correct and complete way. In this reprint of the book, some translated passages have been replaced according to the new version, and some typos in the quotations have been corrected according to the original text. (Basic price: 9.30)
