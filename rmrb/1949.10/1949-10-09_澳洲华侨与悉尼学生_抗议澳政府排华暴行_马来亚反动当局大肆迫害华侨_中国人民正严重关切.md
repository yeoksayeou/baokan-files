Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 7th. Chinese public opinion and returning overseas Chinese are closely watching the development of the Australian expulsion of overseas Chinese. According to a Melbourne dispatch, 48 Australian overseas Chinese filed a lawsuit with the Melbourne Supreme Court on the 4th, requesting a judgment that the Australian Immigration Minister Calwell's order to deport overseas Chinese was unconstitutional, and demanding the revocation of the order. At the same time, the Australian Committee for the Protection of Overseas Chinese has sent a letter to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, accusing the Australian government's anti-Chinese atrocities of violating the Declaration of Human Rights. The Australian wives of overseas Chinese have also signed the indictment, demanding that the United Nations stop Australian Immigration Minister Calwell from any actions that violate the principles of the Declaration of Human Rights. As early as April of this year, the Australian government began its unreasonable atrocities of expelling overseas Chinese, and in August it intensified, forcibly designating a large number of overseas Chinese as "wartime refugees" and detaining and deporting them from Australia. Despite repeated protests from our compatriots and the Australian people, the Australian government has further ordered the expulsion of 2,000 overseas Chinese who went to Australia in the past 25 years under the pretext of so-called "illegal entry." Up to now, many compatriots have been detained, abused and deported, and have fallen into a tragic situation of displacement. People here express concern and indignation at the suffering compatriots and the Australian government's policy of racial discrimination against compatriots.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 8th. TASS Sydney dispatch: More than 700 students from the University of Sydney held a special gathering on October 6 to protest the racial discrimination policy of the Australian Federal Labor Government in forcibly deporting people of Asian nationalities. The conference passed a resolution by an overwhelming majority, strongly protesting the deportation of many Chinese, Malayans and Indonesians who have married Australian women and whose families also live in Australia. Walker, a representative of the Methodist Church, said at the meeting: "The Federal Government's policy of deporting foreigners is a manifestation of ugly racism. Immigration Minister Calwell claims that these deported people are 'undesirables,' which is typical racist propaganda."

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 7th. The bloody anti-Chinese atrocities of the British colonial authorities in Malaya are causing serious concern here. According to a United Press dispatch from Kuala Lumpur on September 29, British High Commissioner for Malaya, Gurney, admitted that nearly 10,000 people have been deported in the so-called "anti-communist cleansing" campaign, most of whom are overseas Chinese. In addition, another 5,000 people have been killed or imprisoned.

    抗议澳政府排华暴行
    马来亚反动当局大肆迫害华侨
    中国人民正严重关切
    【新华社北京七日电】中国舆论与归国华侨正密切注视澳大利亚排斥华侨事件的发展。据墨尔钵消息，澳大利亚华侨四十八人已于四日向墨尔钵最高法院提起诉讼，要求判决澳移民部长加尔威尔驱逐华侨出境令为违反宪法，并要求废除该命令。同时，澳保卫华侨委员会已致书联合国秘书长，控诉澳政府的排华暴行为违反人权宣言。华侨的澳籍妻子亦在控诉书上签字，要求联合国制止澳移民部长加尔威尔违反人权宣言原则的任何行为。澳政府早在今年四月间即已开始无理排斥华侨的暴行，至八月间则更变本加厉，强指大批华侨为“战时难民”而予以拘禁并放逐离澳。虽迭经我侨胞及澳大利亚人民的抗议，但澳政府反进一步借口所谓“非法入境”而下令驱逐过去二十五年中赴澳的两千名华侨。迄今为止，已有侨胞多人横被拘禁、虐待与驱逐，并陷于流离失所的悲境。此间人士对于受难的侨胞和澳政府这种迫害侨胞的种族歧视政策，咸绪表关切和愤慨。
    【新华社北京八日电】塔斯社悉尼讯：悉尼大学学生七百余人于十月六日举行特别集会，抗议澳大利亚联邦工党政府将亚洲民族人民强行驱逐出境的种族歧视政策。大会以绝大多数通过决议，强烈抗议将许多已和澳大利亚妇女结婚并且家属也住在澳大利亚的中国人、马来亚人和印尼人驱逐出境。美以美教的代表华克尔在会上讲话说：“联邦政府驱逐外人出境的政策，是丑恶的种族主义精神的表现。移民部长加尔威尔声称这些被驱逐出境的人是‘不良分子’，这种话是典型的种族主义的宣传。”
    【新华社北京七日电】马来亚英殖民当局血腥的排华暴行，正引起此间严重的关切。据合众社吉隆坡九月二十九日讯，英驻马来亚高级专员格尔奈承认：在所谓“清洗共产主义”的运动中，已有将近一万人被驱逐出境，其中多数是华侨。此外另有五千人已被杀害或遭监禁。
