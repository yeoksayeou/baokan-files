　　A Record of Two Ball Games
    Feng Zhong
    Yesterday (the 24th) the two ball game exhibition matches in the sports meet—the basketball game between the Shanghai visiting group and the Beijing United team, and the football game between the Northeast visiting group and the Beijing United team—were both extremely exciting and intense.

    The basketball game was held at noon. The Shanghai team included two basketball representatives, with the rest being worker representatives and football representatives, possessing famous players such as Wu Chengzhang and Cai Yanxiong; the "Beijing United" team was jointly formed by the "Student Union" team, which had recently been abroad, and the "Mummy" team, mostly university students. Before the game, the "Beijing United" team presented flowers to the visiting team, showing courtesy first. Referees Zhou Chunhong and Li Qingan blew their whistles simultaneously, and the game began. Beijing attacked north, Shanghai attacked south, and for the first two minutes, neither side scored. Deng Huayao of the Beijing United team committed the first foul, and Wu Chengzhang made the free throw, one to zero, with the Shanghai team taking the lead. Then Cai Yanxiong of the Shanghai team fouled, and Wang Qi scored one point from the free throw. He Zeng of the Shanghai team scored two points with a one-handed shot, three to one, with the Shanghai team still leading. The Beijing United team launched a counterattack, with Tang Zhensheng passing to Deng Huayao who scored a goal, and Zhao Zhenmian making a layup, and in the first quarter Beijing United won the game five to three, reversing the defeat. After a one-minute break, the game resumed. The Beijing United team repeatedly got opportunities under the basket. Tang Zhensheng scored two points within the free throw line, and with the help of Zhao Zhenmian, he scored another goal under the basket. Wang Qi scored with a one-handed shot, eleven to three, with the Beijing United team taking a significant advantage. The Shanghai team counterattacked, with Shen Pengju shooting in a turnaround and Wu Chengzhang scoring another goal. Wang Qi of the Beijing United team scored another three points from free throws and shots, and Zhao Zhenmian steadily scored two points with a single dribble. At the end of the first half, the score was sixteen to seven, with the Beijing United team leading all the way. After a break and switching baskets, the game resumed. Zhang Banglun replaced Bai Baohua on the Shanghai team, while the Beijing United team remained unchanged. Not long after the start of the game, the Shanghai team, due to having many veterans, seemed to be running out of stamina. Deng Huayao, Tang Zhensheng, and Zhao Zhenmian of the Beijing United team repeatedly scored, and the score soared. At twenty-four to seven, Wu Chengzhang of the Shanghai team finally scored a goal with a one-handed shot; but Wang Qi and Tang Zhensheng of the Beijing United team continued to score, adding another six points. Later, the game gradually entered a tense stage. The five players of the Beijing United team cleverly passed and scored eight points in a row, and Wang Shengzhi's long shot was also effective again; Shen Pengju, He Zeng, and Wu Chengzhang of the Shanghai team were not far behind, scoring six points in succession. The Shanghai team took a timeout and made substitutions, with Bai Baohua replacing Cai Yanxiong; the Beijing United team also made major personnel adjustments, replacing Cheng Shichun, Chen Wenbin, Wang Pingzhou, and Tan Yijin, and the formation became slightly chaotic. The Shanghai team took the opportunity to counterattack, slightly reversing the downward trend. At the end of the third quarter, the score was forty-six to twenty-two, with the Beijing United team still in the lead. At the start of the last quarter, the two sides were evenly matched, with each side scoring and losing points. The final result was fifty-six to thirty-two, with the Beijing United team winning.

    The football match was held at around 4 p.m., and the two teams ran onto the field. After the Shenyang team presented flowers to the meeting, the game began. Deputy Mayor Zhang Youyu kicked off, and Li Fenglou and Yu Jigang were the referees. The Shenyang team had two Soviet friends, who were physically strong and had brave playing styles. The whole team was full of energy; the "Beijing United" team was formed temporarily and lacked practice, and the coordination was poor. Although they had several opportunities to shoot, they all failed. During the forty-minute game, the ball always hovered in the "Beijing United" team's half of the field, creating many thrilling scenes. Fortunately, Xu Qi, the goalkeeper of the Beijing United team, was "steady and pragmatic" and saved many dangerous shots. In the last few minutes, both sides wanted to make contributions, and the kicking became extremely tense. Until the end of the game, neither side scored, resulting in a score of zero to zero, a friendly tie with no winner or loser. (Attached picture)

　　记两场球赛

    昨（二十四日）天体育大会中的两场球类表演赛——上海参观团对京联的篮球赛及东北参观团对京联的足球赛，均极精彩紧张。
    篮球赛中午举行。沪队中有篮球代表二人，其余为职工代表与足球代表，拥有吴成章、蔡演雄等名手；“京联”由最近曾出国之“学联”队与“木乃伊”队联合组成，多为各大学学生。赛前“京联”队向客队献花，先礼后兵。裁判员周春鸿、李清安双笛齐鸣，比赛开始。京攻北，沪攻南，前两分钟各无所获。京联邓华耀初次犯规，吴成章主罚中的，一比零，沪队首先开张。旋沪队蔡演雄犯规，王琪罚入一分。沪队何曾单手投入二分，三比一沪队仍领先。京联队展开反攻，唐振声外传邓华耀投入一球，赵振绵上篮立功，第一节五比三京联反败为胜。休息一分钟再战。京联屡得篮下机会，唐振声在罚线内投二分，又得赵振绵之助，篮下再进一球，王琪单手投入，十一比三，京联大占优势。沪队反攻，沈鹏举回身射入，吴成章继进一球。京联王琪连罚带投又进三分，赵振绵单身拍入稳进二分。前半时结果十六比七，京联队一路领先。休息换篮再战。沪队张邦纶上，白葆华下，京联仍原班人马。开球未几，沪队因多老将，体力似感不济；京联邓华耀、唐振声、赵振绵屡屡建功，分数扶摇直上，至二十四比七，沪队吴成章始单手托入一球；但京联王琪，唐振声又连连中的，再增六分，以后渐入紧张阶段。京联队五人巧递妙传连获八分，王胜治远投亦再度奏效；沪队沈鹏举、何曾、吴成章亦不落后，接连投入六分。沪队暂停换人，白葆华上，蔡演雄下；京联亦大调换人事，换上程式春、陈文彬、王屏周、谭以津，阵角略乱。沪队乘机反攻，略转颓势，第三节终了，四十六比廿二，京联仍占先。最后一节开始，双方势均力敌，互有得失，总结果五十六比三十二，京联胜。
    足球比赛下午四时许举行，两队跑步入场。沈阳队向大会献花后，比赛开始。张友渔副市长开球，李凤楼、虞积刚裁判。沈阳队员中有苏籍朋友二人，身体健壮，踢法骁勇，全队精力充沛；“京联”队为临时组成，缺乏练习，联络较差，虽也曾数度得射门机会，均功亏一篑。四十分钟比赛中，球始终在“京联”队的半边场盘旋，演出许多惊险场面，幸京联门守徐琪“稳扎稳打”，屡救险球。至最后之数分钟，双方均欲立功，踢来紧张万分，至终场仍均无所获，结果零比零，一团和气，各无胜负。（附图片）
