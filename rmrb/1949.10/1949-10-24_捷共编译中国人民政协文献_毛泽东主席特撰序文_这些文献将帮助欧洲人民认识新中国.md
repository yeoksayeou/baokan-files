Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 23rd. A Czech book entitled "The Victory of New Democracy in China," which includes a preface by Chairman Mao, will be published in Prague on the 25th of this month. This is a collection of documents, including Chairman Mao's "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," Commander-in-Chief Zhu's "The Chinese People's Struggle for Liberation" written for the newspaper "For Lasting Peace and People's Democracy," and all the documents of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

The full text of Chairman Mao's preface is as follows: "The comrades of the Czechoslovak Communist Party are publishing the documents of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and my essay on the people's democratic dictatorship in Czech, which is a source of pride for the Chinese Communist Party. The struggle of the Chinese people and the struggle of the European people are two inseparable and mutually supportive parts of a common cause, although their stages of revolutionary development are different due to different levels of social development. All readers in Europe who are concerned about the fate of Asia will gain basic knowledge about the New China by reading these short documents, especially by reading the sixty articles of the Common Program adopted by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. I believe that the efforts made by the Czech comrades to help European readers understand the New China are a commendable contribution to the international revolutionary movement. Mao Zedong."

This collection was compiled and translated by the "International Politics" monthly, edited by Comrade Jirmindel, one of the secretaries of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party. It will serve as teaching material for the Czechoslovak Communist Party School and as reading material for all party cadres. It is also a necessary book for all institutions, schools, organizations, factories, libraries, and study groups.

　　捷共编译中国人民政协文献
  　毛泽东主席特撰序文
    这些文献将帮助欧洲人民认识新中国
    【新华社布拉格二十三日电】有毛主席序文的捷克文“新民主主义在中国的胜利”一书，将于本月二十五日在捷京出版。这是一本文献汇集，其中包括毛主席的“论人民民主专政”，朱总司令为“争取持久和平与人民民主”报所写的“中国人民的解放斗争”，和中国人民政治协商会议的全部文件。
    毛主席所作序文的全文如下：“捷克共产党的同志们将中国人民政治协商会的文献和我所写的关于中国人民民主专政的论文以捷克文出版，这是中国共产党所引以为荣的。中国人民的斗争与欧洲人民的斗争，是一个共同事业的不可分离和互相援助的两个部分，虽然由于社会发展程度的不同，它们的革命发展阶段也不同。欧洲的关心亚洲命运的一切读者们，由于阅读这些短篇的文件，特别是由于阅读中国人民政治协商会议所通过的六十条共同纲领，将获得关于新中国的基本常识。我相信，捷克的同志们为帮助欧洲读者认识新中国所作的努力，对于国际革命运动乃是一个可感谢的贡献。毛泽东。”
    这本集子是捷共中央书记处书记之一季明德尔主编的“国际政治”月刊辑译的。它将作为捷克共产党党校的教材和全党干部的读物，也是一切机关、学校、团体、工厂、图书馆与学习组所必备的一本书。
