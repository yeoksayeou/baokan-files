The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions' Industrial Workers' Committee
    Arranges for Election of Employee Representatives
    Announces Central Tasks for the Next Two Months
    [Beijing News] The Industrial Workers' Committee of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee convened a meeting of heads of trade unions from various state-owned factories on the 13th to arrange for the election of representatives to the city-wide employee representative assembly, the central work of the trade union for October and November, and disaster relief work through thrift. Zhang Hongshun, director of the committee, reported on several notices regarding the convening of the city-wide employee representative assembly, and explained that each factory should conduct widespread and in-depth publicity before the election, implement the spirit of everyone running the trade union, and elect people who can truly represent the opinions of the broad masses of workers, are active in production and learning, are closely connected with the masses, can take the lead, and are enthusiastic about serving everyone. At the same time, attention should be paid to preventing bad elements from taking advantage of loopholes, and consideration should be given to electing outstanding individuals from various jobs. In factories with many young workers and female workers, the representatives should include a certain number of young workers and female workers.
    Regarding the central tasks of the trade union for October and November, the Industrial Workers' Committee is currently summarizing the experience of democratic management over the past six months. After completion, it will be distributed to various factories for study. Currently, the tram company and the People's Printing Factory are still the key units for carrying out democratic management work. Other factories that meet the conditions must first reach a consensus among the leading cadres, be fully prepared for the central issues to be resolved, and obtain the approval of the higher authorities before convening an employee representative meeting. In terms of production and thrift, the trade union should, on the one hand, cooperate with or suggest that the administration make savings in terms of personnel, organization, and systems, and on the other hand, mobilize workers to save raw materials, water, electricity, fuel, etc., and hold employee forums and other meetings to study how to save and how to develop production on the basis of improving quality. In terms of organization, each factory should further improve the trade union groups so that the trade union work can go deeper. In order to welcome the Asian-Australian Trade Union Representatives Conference, each factory should continue to carry out internationalist education and establish workers' clubs.
    Regarding disaster relief work through thrift: The person in charge of the committee has arranged disaster relief work in various factories according to the plan of the Beijing Municipal Disaster Relief Committee. Workers are called upon to recognize the great role of peasants in supplying the city and industrial production, to learn from the peasants' spirit of self-sacrifice in supporting the Liberation War, and to give play to brotherly love to save and provide disaster relief. Under the Beijing Municipal Disaster Relief Committee, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions has established a disaster relief branch, and each factory has established a branch to be responsible for publicity and mobilization work, and to report to the branch by telephone every other day.
