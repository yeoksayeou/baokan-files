Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 29th—Telecommunications Agency, The Hague, 27th: Thousands of Dutch soldiers, unwilling to fight in Indonesia for the benefit of Dutch imperialism, are being detained in concentration camps in the Netherlands. When the Dutch Commander-in-Chief ordered the Dutch soldiers to be transported to Indonesia last week, two hundred soldiers in the Songgwen Barracks near Utrecht beat officers, wrecked the barracks, and destroyed weapons. Following this incident, fifty-two soldiers in the Nürsnes Barracks also refused to be sent to Indonesia. The head of the barracks summoned the military police. A bloody conflict ensued, and the wounded soldiers were all detained. These situations only became known to the outside world after 1,500 family members of soldiers organized by the Dutch Communist Party's Truth Daily visited the Songgwen Barracks.

　　成千荷军士兵拒赴印尼作战
    【新华社北京二十九日电】电通社海牙二十七日讯：数以千计的荷兰士兵不愿为荷兰帝国主义利益前往印尼作战，而被拘留在荷兰的集中营里。当荷兰总司令上周下令将荷兰士兵运往印尼时，乌得勒支附近松葛文军营中的两百名士兵，曾殴打军官，捣毁兵营和破坏武器。在此事发生后，纽尔斯奈斯军营中的五十二名士兵，也拒绝被派往印尼。该军营负责人召来了宪兵。于是发生了流血的冲突，受伤的士兵，均被拘禁。这些情况，都是在荷共真理报所组织的一千五百名士兵家属前往松葛文军营探望以后，才为外间知道。
