How to Plant Trees After Autumn?
    Jiao Jizhong, Li Ting, Shan Xiwu, Huang Shu, Wu Chengzhang
        I. Willow and Small-leaf Poplar
    (1) Planting cuttings: Use branches about one inch thick, cut into two-foot lengths, sharpen the bottom end, dig a pit and plant it, level the top with the ground, fill with soil and tamp it firmly, and then seal with a one- or two-inch thick soil pile on top. If it is not sandy soil, remove the soil in early spring when it sprouts, so that the cutting is slightly exposed. The small branches on the small-leaf poplar cuttings must be kept for faster sprouting.
    (2) Layering: Dig a pit more than one and a half feet deep, press the bottom of two to four finger-thick branches crossed into the bottom of the pit, fill the soil and tamp it firmly, leaving more than a foot exposed. If too much is exposed, cut off the tender tips with an iron shovel for vigorous growth next year. This is called the "cross method."
    In dry sandy land, it is best to use the "bow-shaped layering method" (pressing a small bow shape). Dig a pit one and a half to two feet deep, with a pit opening eight inches to one foot wide and two feet long. The bottom of the pit is deep at one end and shallow at the other. Align the thick ends of two branches more than three feet long, separate them by two inches, insert them into the deep end of the pit, and then bend the tips downwards and place them in the shallow end of the pit, forming a bow shape (be careful not to break the branches when bending). Level the back of the bow with the ground, fill the soil and tamp it firmly, and then seal with an inch of loose soil. This way, the branches take root at both ends and sprout in the middle, making them easy to grow and vigorous.
    II. Peach and Apricot Trees
    It is best to use one-year-old strong seedlings. Old seedlings have weak rooting and sprouting abilities. Dig a larger pit to allow the roots to spread out when planting. Plant the seedlings one or two inches deeper than the original soil mark. When filling the soil, first fill one or two shovels of fine soil, shake the seedlings up and down to allow the soil to enter the root system, tamp it firmly, and then fill the pit completely and tamp it firmly. Cut off all the upper branches, leaving a three-inch long trunk, and seal it with a soil pile. The new seedlings that grow next year will be particularly strong. Alternatively, some people only prune a portion of the tender branches or do not prune them at all, but bend the seedlings to the ground and bury them. Dig them up again in early spring after they sprout. When planting peach and apricot trees on fire sandy soil (extremely barren coarse sandy soil), a layer of good soil, clay, or a mixture of soil and manure can be laid in the pit first to facilitate sprouting. Plant about thirty peach trees or about twenty apricot trees per mu (approximately 0.16 acres).
    III. Jujube Trees and Pear Trees (Du Li)
    The planting method is the same as for peach and apricot trees. After planting, cover the branches and tips with wet soil. In places with many seedlings, two or three seedlings can be placed in each pit, and the best one can be kept after they grow. When sealing the upper part of the Du Li, interlock the small branches to make the soil more tightly packed. Du Li intended for grafting pear trees should be planted with rows two zhang (approximately 6.6 meters) wide and plants one zhang five (approximately 5 meters) apart. Jujube trees can be planted more densely.
    IV. Willow (Osier, Basket Willow) and Red Tamarisk (Tamarisk, Three-Spring Willow)
    Both willow and red tamarisk are propagated by cuttings. When inserting willow cuttings, one person uses an iron foot pedal to make holes about one and a half feet deep, and another person follows to insert the willow branches, stepping on them with their feet and cutting them off level with the ground. Then insert the second hole, with one long branch inserted into three plants. Finally, one person uses a large lever to tamp them firmly. Before winter, bury them with soil. Plant one plant every foot or so, either in a single row or in double rows (the two rows of parallel planting are more than a foot apart), with rows spaced more than one zhang apart. If there is no foot pedal, the ordinary layering method can also be used.
    Red tamarisk is resistant to alkaline and sandy soil. Cut branches the thickness of a thumb into one and a half foot lengths. Dig pits one foot two or three inches deep and one foot wide, planting three plants in each pit in a triangular shape, which will grow into a large bush. Each bush should be spaced five or six feet apart. Do not prune the branches of red tamarisk and willow that grow in the first year after planting. Start pruning in the second year.
    V. Locust, Black Locust, Elm, and Big-leaf Poplar
    The planting method is the same as for peach and apricot trees. Elm and locust trees are often planted with two-year-old seedlings, as one-year-old seedlings are relatively thin and weak. Big-leaf poplar are planted with this year's wild seedlings. Black locust are planted with one- to two-year-old seedlings. After planting elm seedlings, half of the branches must be pruned. The other three types of seedlings should be cut off two inches above the ground and sealed with soil. They will sprout particularly vigorously next spring. If the seedlings are large, some branches can be pruned instead of cutting the trunk.
    Other seedlings can also be planted after autumn. For small, soft seedlings, bury them in soil to overwinter. For large, hard seedlings, prune more branches and add more soil to prevent them from drying out or freezing to death.
    VI. Other Precautions
    (1) When planting trees, tamp the soil firmly. For seedlings planted and sealed with soil in autumn, dig them up in the Grain Rain season (mid-April to early May) next year. When spring is too dry, remove the soil, water thoroughly, and then seal with loose soil.
    (2) Afforestation in sandy wastelands must be densely planted, with plants spaced three to five feet apart, to quickly provide mutual shade, block the wind, retain moisture, and retain fine sand and soil. This allows them to grow quickly, tall, and straight. When they become too crowded in the future, they can be thinned out for early benefit. If they are planted sparsely, they will be damaged by wind and sand and will not grow. When tree seedlings are scarce, they can be planted in a net-like shelterbelt, with dense planting within the shelterbelt.
    (3) When digging up seedlings, be careful to dig up the roots properly and avoid damaging them in haste.
    (4) When layering willow, put two large branches or four small branches in each pit. Each branch must be in close contact with soil to take root well. Do not squeeze a large bunch of branches together and press them down, as this will cause them to dry out and die in the middle.
    Too long willow branches should be cut into two sections, with the thin end used for layering and the thick end used as cuttings, saving seedlings and making them easier to survive.
    (5) When planting trees in dry sandy land, the pit depth must reach two feet, otherwise they will easily dry out and die in the spring drought.
    (6) For seedlings that are afraid of freezing and cold winds, such as one-year-old or current-year black locust seedlings grown from roots, it is best to dig up the seedlings after leaf fall and bury them completely in the soil. Dig them up and plant them again when they sprout in the spring, so that they will not freeze to death during the following winter.

　　秋后怎样栽树？
    焦济众　李霆　单锡伍　黄舒　武成章
        一、柳树、小叶杨
    （１）栽橛子　用粗一寸左右的枝子，截成二尺来长，下头砍尖，挖坑栽下去，上头和地皮取平，填土砸实，上头再封上一两寸厚的土堆。如果不是沙土，明春发芽时要把土拨开，使橛子微露，小叶杨橛上的小枝须留着，发芽才快。
    （２）压条子　刨一尺半以上的深坑，把二至四根手指粗的条下头交义着按入坑底，填土踩实，上头露出一尺多即可。露的太多时须用铁锨切掉嫩梢，来年生长才旺，这叫“交义法”。
    在干沙地最好用“弓形压条法”（压小弓形），刨一尺半到二尺深的坑，坑口宽八寸至一尺，长二尺左右，坑底一头深一头浅，把两根三尺多长的条子对齐粗头，彼此离开二寸，插入坑底深的一头，再把梢向下弯曲，放入坑底浅的一头，成为弓形（弯弓时别把条折伤了），使弓背和地皮取平，填土踩实，上面再封上一寸厚的松土，这样压的条，两头扎根，当中发芽，易活且旺。
    二、桃杏树
    最好用一年生的壮苗，老苗生根发芽能力都弱，刨坑要大些，好叫根子舒展栽，的深度比原来土印深下一二寸，填土时先填细土一两锨，把小苗上下振动，使土进入根群中，踩紧了再把坑填满砸实。上部枝条全剪去，留下三寸多长的树身，封上土堆，明年新长出来的苗特别壮。此外有仅将嫩枝剪去一部分或全不剪，而把树苗弯到地皮上埋上，明春发芽后再刨开。在火砂土（极瘠薄之粗砂土）上栽桃杏树时，坑里可先铺上一层好土、胶泥或混上点土粪才易发芽。每亩地栽桃树约三十棵，杏树约二十棵。
    三、枣树、杜梨
    栽法和桃杏树相同，栽后用湿土盖上枝梢，树苗多的地方，每坑可以放上两三个苗，长起来后再留个好的。杜梨上部封土时，要把小枝互结成扣，埋土更宜密实。准备接梨树的杜梨，栽时以行宽两丈、棵远一丈五最合适，枣树可以密些。
    四、柳子（杞柳、簸箕柳）、红荆（柽柳、三春柳）
    柳子和红荆都用插条法，插柳子的时候一人用铁脚蹬子穿窟窿，深约一尺半，一人跟着插柳条，用脚踩住，齐地皮削下来，接着插第二个孔，一根长条插三棵，最后一人拿大杠子用力＠，入冬前用土埋上，一尺多远插一棵，单行栽或双行并栽都可以（并栽的两行相隔一尺多），行与行要相隔一丈以外，没有脚蹬时用普通压条法也行。
    红荆耐碱地沙地，将大姆指粗的条截成一尺半长，刨深一尺二三寸、宽一尺左右的坑，每坑栽三棵，摆成三角形，将来长成一大＠，每＠相隔五六尺。红荆和柳子栽后第一年生的条不要削，第二年开始削。
    五、槐树、洋槐、榆树和大叶杨
    栽法和桃杏树同。榆树、槐树常用二年生的苗。一年的较细弱。大叶杨用当年的野生苗。洋槐用一至二年生的苗。榆树苗栽后须剪去一半枝条，其他三种树苗齐地皮以上二寸削去，用土封好，明春发芽特别壮。如果苗子较大，可剪去一部分条子而不去树身。
    别的树苗在秋后都可以栽，苗小条软的用土埋上过冬，苗大干硬的多剪些枝，多培些土，便不会干死或冷死。
    六、其他应注意事项
    （１）栽树要把土砸实，秋后栽了封上土的树苗，到明年谷雨节再刨开，春天过旱时可拨开土，浇透了水，再封上松土。
    （２）砂荒造林必须密植，三至五尺一棵，以求很快互相荫蔽，挡住风，保住水气，留住细沙细土，长的又快、又高、又直，待将来太挤了可以间伐，得利也早。如果栽稀了便叫风沙摔坏，长不起来。树秧缺乏时可栽成网状林带，林带内密植。
    （３）刨树苗要仔细把根刨好，别贪快把根拔坏。
    （４）杨柳压条，每坑大条放两根，小条放四根便足。每根条子周围都要贴上土才好扎根，不要将一大把条子挤在一起压下去，以致当中透风全枯死。
    太长的杨柳条要砍成两段，细头压条，粗头插橛子，又省秧，又好活。
    （５）干沙地栽树，坑深要达到二尺，否则春旱时易干死。
    （６）怕冻、怕寒风的树苗，如一年生的或当年由根长起来的洋槐苗，最好在落叶后把树苗刨下来，完全埋入土内，到春天发芽的时候再刨出来栽，以后过冬就冻不死了。（附图片）法条压叉交    法条压形弓铁角蹬子
