Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 23rd: Most of the industries in Shanghai that are necessary for people's livelihoods have fully or largely resumed operations. According to a survey conducted by the preparatory committee of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce, covering over four thousand private factories in forty-one industries in the city, as of September, the following were fully operational: rice milling, medical equipment, photoengraving, etc., totaling 352 enterprises. Over 90% operational: machinery industry, shipbuilding, vegetable oil refining, cotton spinning, flour milling, etc., totaling over 1,200 enterprises. Over 80% operational: machine manufacturing, bakelite, machine dyeing and weaving, etc., totaling over 1,900 enterprises. The remaining important industries, such as the silk weaving industry with over 300 enterprises, have 70% operational; the steel smelting industry with 30 enterprises, has 18 operational; the pig bristle sorting industry with over 100 enterprises, has half operational. From the statistics, it can be seen that the most essential industries for people's livelihoods, such as grain, rice, and flour, have fully or 90% operational; cultural supplies such as color printing, photography, and photoengraving are also almost fully operational, indicating the people's need for the new culture in the liberated areas. In heavy industry, shipbuilding and the machinery industry are gradually improving in coordination with the requirements of national construction. Due to the increasing demand for machinery in rural areas, the percentage of machinery industry operations has rapidly increased from 20% to 98%. The cotton spinning, weaving, and dyeing industries have also improved recently, as a result of the resolution of raw material issues, the expansion of the South China liberated areas, the increasing expansion of sales channels, and the increased purchasing power of the old liberated areas.

　　沪私营工商业大部恢复生产
  　粮米面粉业近全部开工棉纺染织业产销已增大
    【新华社上海二十三日电】上海市一般为民生所必需的工业，都已经全部或大部复工。根据上海工商联合会筹备会调查本市四十一种私营工业四千多家工厂的结果，到九月份为止，全部复工的有碾米业，医疗器械业，照相制版业等三百五十二家；百分之九十以上开工的有机器工业、造船业、植物油炼制业、棉纺织业、面粉业等一千二百多家；百分之八十以上开工的有机器制造业、胶木业、机器染织业等一千九百多家；其余重要的工业如丝织业三百多家，有百分之七十开工；钢铁炼制业三十家，有十八家开工；猪鬃整理业一百多家，半数开工。从统计中可以看出，民生最必需的粮米、面粉等工业，已经全部或百分之九十开工；文化用品如彩印、照相、制版等，也差不多全部开工，说明解放区人民对新文化的需要；重工业方面如造船、机器工业在配合国家建设的要求下，都已日渐好转。机器工业由于农村对机器的需要量增加，开工的百分率由百分之二十迅速增加到百分之九十八。棉纺染织等工业最近也已经好转，这是由于原料问题获得解决，华南解放区扩大，销路日益扩大和老解放区购买力增高的结果。
