　　Please Take Back Our Love and Respect for the Soviet People and Stalin
　　Guo Moruo
　　Respected friends of the Soviet Cultural Delegation and the Red Army Song and Dance Ensemble, as you are about to return home, we are truly reluctant to part with you. Although the delegation's time in China has been short, its significance in consolidating the friendship between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union and promoting cultural exchange between the two nations is extraordinarily important. During this month, the delegation members have worked tirelessly, holding numerous seminars with our scientific, educational, and literary workers, and giving many speeches at mass meetings of students, workers, and troops, providing us with much valuable knowledge and deepening our understanding of the great Soviet culture. The gifts the delegation has given us are so precious that we are extremely grateful. At the same time, in this short month, the delegation members have also seen how strongly united our Chinese intellectuals are, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people, striving to develop the New Democratic cultural cause, enthusiastically learning from the Soviet Union, and warmly supporting the international peace and democratic movement led by our great ally, the Soviet Union, resolutely adhering to "leaning to one side." If we have any gifts worthy of offering to the delegation to take back, then this enthusiasm and this confidence of ours can be considered the best gifts. Respected friends, please take back our loving enthusiasm for the Soviet people, please take back our sincere respect for the mentor of the world's progressive people and the great leader of the Soviet people, Marshal Stalin! We believe that your visit is a great beginning. We eagerly look forward to closer and more frequent cultural exchanges, and welcome more cultural envoys to come continuously!

　　把我们对苏联人民和斯大林的敬爱带回去吧
    郭沫若
    伟大友邦苏联的文化代表团和红军歌舞团各位敬爱的朋友们现在要归国了，我们真是依依不舍。代表团在中国的时间虽然不多，然而对于巩固中苏两大民族的友谊，促进两大民族的文化交流，其意义是异常重大的。一个月中间，代表团诸位先生不辞辛苦，和我们的科学、教育、文艺工作者举行许多次的座谈会，在学生、工人、部队的群众大会上作过多次讲演，给了我们许多宝贵的知识，使我们对于伟大的苏维埃文化有了更深刻的认识，——代表团给我们的礼物是这样珍贵，我们真是十二分的感谢。同时，在短短一个月中，代表团诸位先生也看到了我们中国的知识分子如何坚强地团结一致，在中国人民伟大领袖毛主席领导之下，为开展新民主主义的文化事业而努力，热烈地向苏联学习，并且热烈地拥护我们的伟大友邦苏联所领导的反法西斯反侵略的国际和平民主运动，坚决地“一边倒”。如果我们有什么礼物值得献给代表团带回去的话，那么，我们这一份热忱，这一片信心，便算是最好的礼物。敬爱的朋友们，请把我们对于苏维埃人民的亲爱的热忱，请把我们对于世界进步人民的导师和苏维埃人民的伟大领袖斯大林大元帅的真挚的敬意，带回去罢！我们相信，你们这次的访问，是一个伟大的开端。我们热烈地期待着更密切更频繁的文化交流，欢迎更多的文化使节源源而来！
