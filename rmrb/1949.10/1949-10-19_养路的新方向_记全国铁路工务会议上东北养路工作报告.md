　　A New Direction for Road Maintenance
  　Report on Road Maintenance Work in Northeast China at the National Railway Engineering Conference
    Chen Ji
    On October 18th, at the Ministry of Railways' National Engineering Conference, I heard a report by Li Junping, Director of the Engineering Department of the Harbin Railway Bureau in Northeast China, on a new road maintenance method. This is a new direction for road maintenance in the people's railways, and it is the path that railway maintenance workers across the country should take.
    The new road maintenance method is an advanced experience from the Soviet socialist countries. After more than 20 years of practice by Soviet railway workers, it has proven to be the most scientific and reasonable road maintenance method. This method was introduced by Iliushen, the Chief of the Engineering Section of the China Changchun Railway in April of this year, and Northeast railway bureaus began to accept this method and gradually promote it in Northeast China.
    What is the new road maintenance method? Director Li Junping explained: The new road maintenance method is to implement a road maintenance method where everyone is responsible, it is the implementation of the "responsibility system" in road maintenance work. This road maintenance method is to prevent the occurrence of adverse conditions on the line in a planned way, to carry out repairs step by step, to ensure good quality, and to continuously ensure traffic safety.
    New Road Maintenance Organization
    The new road maintenance method adopts the "three-package system" in organization, just like the locomotive responsibility system, implementing package repair, package maintenance, and package inspection for the line, which are interconnected, closely coordinated, and strictly divided in labor. The workers in each road maintenance work area can be divided into three shifts: inspection shift, maintenance shift, and repair shift. The inspection shift is responsible for daily patrol inspections. If any problems are found on the line that one person can do, they should be repaired immediately; if one person cannot do it, the maintenance shift is responsible for repair; if it is more difficult, the foreman can be reported to temporarily dispatch more people for repair. They are also responsible for some fixed tasks, such as tightening screws, driving spikes, cleaning crossings, removing weeds, or clearing ditches. The maintenance shift is specialized in maintenance and occasional minor repairs. On the one hand, it accepts the lines repaired by the repair shift after inspection and acceptance, and maintains them; but it can refuse to accept unqualified repair lines. Once accepted, it must pay attention to maintenance to ensure good quality. The repair shift can also check its maintenance work at any time, and if it finds that the quality has deteriorated, it can urge it to repair it to reach the original level. On the other hand, the maintenance shift must ensure the safety of traffic on the lines that the repair shift has not yet done, until the repair shift has completely repaired them. The repair shift is the main force. The entire shift is divided into several groups according to technical level, proficiency, work ability, and the nature of road maintenance work. Each person must be responsible for one or two or three fixed tasks, and each task has a dedicated person responsible for inspection. They repair section by section according to the plan every day, and everything that should be done every day must be completed. After formal inspection and acceptance, a "qualified" certificate is issued before it can be handed over to the maintenance shift.
    According to the results of the implementation in Northeast China, it is believed that such an organization should fix the work undertaken by each worker himself, in order to become skilled and improve work efficiency.
    Repair Method
    Regarding the repair methods of the repair shift, Director Li believes that the situation of all lines within the work area and the nature of the repair must be investigated clearly, and the amount of labor and materials required should be calculated according to a certain work rate, in order to establish monthly and daily repair plans. Then the repair shift repairs section by section according to the plan. Before starting work, careful preparation must be made to avoid temporary confusion. According to the experience of Northeast China, the number of people in the repair shift should not be too large, and 10 to 20 people are most suitable. The division of labor between Suihua and Harbin sections proves this point.
    After the repair shift repairs one kilometer of line, it should promptly notify the engineering section to send a dedicated person for inspection and acceptance. The inspection and acceptance time should not exceed three days, in order to ensure quality. The inspection and acceptance standards are divided into three grades, the lowest grade is qualified, and those who are unqualified will be repaired. The inspectors should be fixed, so that they are familiar with the standards, and the work efficiency can be improved.
    Advantages of New Road Maintenance Method
    What are the differences between the new road maintenance method and the old road maintenance method? Director Li told everyone from his actual experience: The old road maintenance method did not have a strict division of labor, and work was carried out according to the season. When replacing sleepers, only sleepers were replaced, and it was done in isolation without contact. There was no inspection of the daily work, and the quality and work efficiency could not be known until the general inspection at the end of autumn. The work of the old road maintenance method had no fixed location, and it was done in the east and in the west, which was futile and made the workers exhausted. The new road maintenance method has a plan every day, a fixed area, and advances section by section. What to do every day, how much to do, and how well it is done are all clear at a glance. Because it is planned and inspected, the line is therefore good and saves labor. The work of the old road maintenance method is often disconnected, and sometimes it is repeated before and after. For example, only sleepers are replaced when replacing sleepers, and the spikes are nailed. When the gauge is changed, the spikes are pulled out and nailed again. Therefore, it wastes manpower and is thankless. The new road maintenance method does every section thoroughly, and all the problems must be corrected. When replacing sleepers, the direction, screws, and spikes must be done well, and they will never be ignored like the old method. In the old method, when replacing sleepers, the ones near the station are replaced first, and the ones far away are not replaced, and the replacements are not uniform. The new method starts from a distance and works to the place near the station, and no one is lazy. Because the new method has a detailed division of labor, the foreman and supervisor can take time to plan, investigate, and prevent line damage in advance. This is what the old method cannot do. The Suihua Engineering Section's response to the new and old road maintenance methods can best illustrate the obvious differences between the two. They said: "The old road maintenance method lets work dominate people, the line controls people, the work is tiring, and it is not done well; the new road maintenance method makes people dominate work, people manage the line, everyone is responsible, and the line is renewed. Good workers welcome the new road maintenance method; second-rate loafers don't like it, because they can't be lazy."
    In general, the advantages of the new road maintenance method are: it can correctly organize labor, and the work is closely coordinated, like the gears of a clock, one gear tooth connects to another gear tooth, without the slightest confusion. Because the division of labor is reasonable, everyone can do their best and fulfill their responsibilities. However, its most important advantage, Director Li said, is to improve the quality of the line and maintain a good condition for a long time. After the Acheng Engineering Section in Northeast China implemented the new road maintenance method, the line was generally good. Before the Sankeshu Engineering Section implemented the new road maintenance method, the train speed at 42 kilometers to 43 kilometers of the Zhoujia work area was 39 kilometers, the left and right vibration wavelength was 25 millimeters, and the up and down vibration wavelength was 11 millimeters; after the implementation of the new road maintenance method, the train speed increased to 44 kilometers, and the left and right vibration wavelength decreased to 2 millimeters, and the up and down vibration wavelength decreased to 5 millimeters.
    Northeast Pilot Experience
    After the new road maintenance method was implemented in the Northeast Railway, the road maintenance workers were very happy. They cherished this method like a treasure, and they said: "Since we have this new method, when we think back to the old method, we feel a little sick." A foreman from the Boli Engineering Section saw an article about the new road maintenance method published in the Railway Bureau's newspaper, and quickly cut it out and pasted it in his diary, studying it carefully every day. The supervisors went to the site and saw the line conditions after the implementation of the new road maintenance method, and said: "The line is young and strong, and it is no longer like an old man with a bent back in the past."
    However, the implementation of the new road maintenance method in the Northeast Railway was not without twists and turns. Director Li said: The biggest obstacle encountered at the beginning of the implementation was conservative thinking. Many employees are always stuck in the old methods, do not believe in the benefits of the new methods, and are unwilling to reform. Some foremen from the Xiachenzi Engineering Section once said: "I have been driving for more than 20 years, isn't the line still very good? What new method or no new method?" Despite how much ideological obstacles the employees have, Director Li told everyone: "We must firmly and unshakably convince them and prove it to them with facts." The work of Foreman Qi Jia and Foreman Yan Jia of the Boli Engineering Section is both to repair the line. Foreman Yan Jia accepted the new method, and each time the superior checked the work, it was qualified. Foreman Qi Jia was stubborn and refused to use the new method, and as a result, each time the work did not meet the standards, and the workers under his leadership opposed him, and he was finally forced to adopt the new method.
    According to Director Li's estimation, the Northeast climate allows at least six months of road maintenance each year. If road maintenance is carried out according to the new road maintenance method, it will only take four months to complete it once; and for the remaining two months, the second time can be completed. The northern railways have at least seven months of time each year, and it is not a problem to do it twice with the new road maintenance method. The southern railways have at least eight months of time to maintain the road, then it can be done three times. If the northern and southern railways can start to adopt the new road maintenance method from now on, after the northern railways have completed the work of screening ballast and major repairs, the quality of the line will exceed the quality of the Northeast Railway, and the southern railways will also quickly change their appearance, and the line will improve a step.
    Before implementing the new method, it is best to plan and organize a commando team. The employees of the commando team must have a full understanding of the new method and be able to use it proficiently. After the successful trial on a certain line in advance, they can be sent out to help everyone and drive the promotion of the new method on each line. Director Li said: "This experience has been quite effective in Northeast China." But Director Li emphasized to the conference: "To promote the new road maintenance method, the thinking of the cadres must be cleared up first, especially the thinking of the leaders at the section chief level.

　　养路的新方向
  　记全国铁路工务会议上东北养路工作报告
    陈  迹
    十月十八日，在铁道部全国工务会议上，我听到了东北哈尔滨局工务处处长李均平的新养路法的报告，这是人民铁路养路的新方向，是全国铁路养路工作者所应该走的道路。
    新养路法是苏联社会主义国家的先进经验，经过苏联铁路工人二十多年的实践，证明为最科学最合理的养路方法。今年四月经中长路局工务科长衣留申的介绍，东北各铁路局开始接受了这个方法，逐步推行于东北。
    什么叫新养路法？李均平处长解释道：新养路法就是贯彻人人负责的养路法，是“负责制”在养路工作上的实施。这种养路法是要有计划地防止线路发生不良现象，有步骤地进行补修，保证质量良好，不间断地保证行车安全。
    新的养路组织
    新养路法在组织上是采取“三包制”，象机务负责制一样，对线路实行包修、包养和包检，互相联系，密切配合，严格分工。每个养路工区的工人都可分为三班：包检班、包养班与包修班。包检班，每日负责巡回检查，发现线路不良之处，一人能做的，立即修理；一人做不了的，则由包养班负责补修；再困难时，可报告工长，临时多派人补修。他们还要担当某些固定工作，如上螺丝、打道钉、道口清扫、除草或清水沟等。包养班，专门负责养护及随时的零星小补修。一方面接收包修班作完了的经过检收的线路，加以养护；但它可以拒绝接受不合格的补修线路。既经接受后，就要注意养护，保证质量良好。包修班又可以随时检查它的养护工作，如发现质量变坏，可以督促其补修，以达到原先水平。另一方面，保养班要对包修班还未做到的线路，保证维持行车安全，直至包修班彻底补修为止。包修班是主要力量，全班按技术高低、熟练程度及工作能力和养路工作性质，划分为若干小组，每个人必须担当一项或二、三项的固定工作，每项工作都有专人负责检查。他们每天按计划逐段补修，每天应做的都要做完，经过正式检收，发给“合格”证明书，始能交给包养班。
    这样的组织，根据东北推行的结果，认为应该要使每个工人所担当的本身工作固定起来，以资熟练，而提高工作效率。
    包修的方法
    关于包修班补修方法，李处长以为必须把工区管内全部线路的情况、补修性质调查清楚，按一定工率，算出所需要的人工和材料数量，以便订立每月和每天的补修计划。然后包修班按计划一段段去补修。做工以前，必须要有精细的准备，以免临时手忙脚乱。根据东北的经验，包修班的人数不宜过多，以十人到二十人为最适合。绥化及哈尔滨两段的分工，就证明了这一点。
    包修班补修一公里线路以后，应及时通知工务段派专人检收，检收时间，不能超过三天以外，以保证质量。检收标准分三等，最低一等为合格，不合格者重修。检收的人要固定，使其熟悉标准，工作效率才能提高。
    新养路法优点
    新养路法和旧养路法究竟有些什么不同呢？李处长以其实际的经验告诉大家：旧养路法没有严格的分工，是按季节进行工作，换枕木时，光换枕木，孤立去做，没有联系。每天工作，没有检查，其质量如何，工作效率如何，一直要等到秋末总检查时方能知道。旧养路法的工作，无固定地点，东搞一头，西搞一头，往返徒劳，弄得工人精疲力竭。新养路法每天有计划，有固定地区，逐段推进，每天做什么，做多少，做的怎样，一目了然。由于它有计划，有检查，线路因而良好，节省人工。旧养路法的工作经常脱节，有时前后重复，如换枕木就单换枕木，钉上了道钉，等到改轨距时，又拔起道钉再钉上。因此浪费人力，吃力不讨好。新养路法每做一段，工作要彻底，毛病都要改好。换枕木时，方向、螺丝、道钉都要搞好，决不象旧法置之不管。旧法换枕木，先换离站近的，不换远的，换的不匀。新法则从远地做起，做到离站近的地方，没人偷懒。由于新法分工仔细，工长监工员可以抽出时间来计划、调查，预先防止线路损坏。这是旧法所做不到的。绥化工务段对于新旧养路法的反映，最能说明两者的明显区别。他们说：“旧养路法，让工作支配人，线路管人，工作累，作不好；新养路法，使人支配工作，人管线路，人人负责，线路翻新。好工人欢迎新养路法；二流子懒汉才不喜欢，因为他们不能偷懒。”
    总起来说，新养路法的优点是：能正确的组织劳动力，工作配合很密切，如同钟表的齿轮一样，一个轮齿接一个轮齿，没有丝毫错乱。由于分工合理，人人能各出其力、各尽其责。然而它最主要的优点，李处长说，是使线路质量提高，长久保持良好状态。东北阿城工务段实施新养路法以后，线路普遍良好。三棵树工务段未实行新养路法以前，在周家工区四十二公里到四十三公里的地方，列车行驶速度为三十九公里，左右振动波长为二十五公厘，上下振动波长为十一公厘；在实行新养路法以后，行车速度提高到四十四公里，而左右振动波长降至二公厘，上下振动波长降至五公厘。
    东北试行经验
    在东北铁路实行了新养路法以后，养路工们都非常高兴，他们把这个方法当作宝贝似地珍爱它，他们说：“自从有了这个新办法，咱们回想起旧法子，真有点恶心。”勃利工务段有个工长看见了铁路局局报上发表了新养路法的文章，连忙剪下来，贴在自己的日记簿上，每天仔细研究。监工员们到现场上去，看见了实行新养路法后的线路情形，连说：“线路年青健壮了，再不象过去弓着背的老头子了。”
    然而东北铁路实行新养路法，并不是没有波折的。李处长讲道：在开始实行的时候，碰到的最大障碍就是保守思想。有不少员工老是拘泥于旧法，不相信新法的好处，不愿意改革。下城子工务段有些工长曾说：“跑了二十多年车，线路还不是很好吗？什么新法不新法？”尽管员工们有多大思想障碍，李处长告诉大家说：“我们必须坚定不移地说服他们，用事实证明给他们看。”勃利工务段祁家工长和阎家工长的工作，同是补修线路。阎家工长接受了新方法，每次上级检查工作，都合格了。祁家工长顽固，不肯用新方法，结果每次工作不合标准，他领导下的工友都反对他，最后也被迫采用了新法。
    据李处长估计，东北气候，每年至少可以养路六个月，如按新养路法来养路，只要四个月就能作好一遍；还有两个月，可以作完第二遍。北方铁路，每年至少有七个月的时间，以新养路法作两遍，是不成问题的。南方铁路，至少有八个月时间能够养路，那就可以作三遍。南北方各路如能从现在开始采用新养路法，北方各路在做完筛石碴和大补修的工作以后，线路质量将超过东北铁路的质量，南方铁路亦将迅速改变面貌，线路将提高一步。
    在实行新法之前，最好有计划地组织一个突击队，突击队的员工对于新法都要有充分的认识，并能熟练运用，预先在某个线路试验成功以后，就可以派他们出去，到各线路帮助大家，带动推行新法。李处长说：“这个经验，在东北颇为收效。”但是李处长着重地向大会指出：“要推行新养路法，干部的思想必须要先搞通，尤其是段长一级领导人的思想。
