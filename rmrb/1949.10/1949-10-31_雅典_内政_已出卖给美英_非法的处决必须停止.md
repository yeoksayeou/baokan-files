　　Ukrainian Representative Manuilsky emphasized: If the majority of the Political Committee rejects the Soviet proposal, it will mean that the Political Committee approves a policy that further deteriorates the domestic situation in Greece, which is filled with serious entanglements that could threaten peace in the Balkans.

　　Soviet delegation head Vyshinsky, in a comprehensive speech at the end of the meeting, exhaustively analyzed the objections expressed by those who opposed the Soviet proposal and proved that these objections were untenable.

　　Vyshinsky said: "For three sessions, the Greek representative has stubbornly tried to persuade the committee to believe that the Soviet delegation's proposal is a so-called interference in Greece's internal affairs. The Canadian representative said the same today, but in reality, we are not interfering in the internal affairs of a sovereign country here at all. The reason is very simple: what Greece represents now is, unfortunately, only a memory of this country's sovereignty. These people are no longer autonomous, and their internal affairs have been rented out to foreign capital, so there is no question of interference. Mr. Greek Representatives, you were not happy when our colleague Manuilsky, the Ukrainian representative, talked about this. And you are also unhappy when the Polish and Czechoslovak representatives talk about how Greece has lost its sovereignty today. You think Greece is now an autonomous country. But what do you think of what Mr. Porter, the head of the US mission to Greece, said at that time? On September 20, 1947, the American magazine Collier's published an article by Porter, in which the author made a quite realistic analysis of the Greek situation. Porter wrote: 'I believe that it (i.e., Tsaldaris' Greek government) intends to use foreign aid to permanently maintain the privileges of a small group of bankers and merchants who are an insignificant force in Greece. In this case, the British have often relied on the formula of cooperating with the local ruling class to maintain their right to exploit the masses and suppress the people with police and whips, in order to buy them off.' These words written by the former head of the US mission to Greece are fully in line with reality, and several conclusions can be drawn from them: First, Greece does not have autonomy at present, because the Athens government has sold this autonomy to the British and Americans for dollars, and recently, these dollars have been pouring into the pockets of the Greek government in large quantities. Second, in this case, the Greek government is not the master of its country. Third, in this case, there is no question of interfering in the country's internal affairs, because its internal affairs are only 'vain.' Mr. Tsaldaris and Mr. Pipinelis, all your internal affairs are the affairs of the Anglo-American occupation authorities."

　　Vyshinsky continued: "Finally, I would like to remind you that all we are asking for here is one thing: we demand an end to the illegal executions, we demand an end to the execution of nine Greek patriots who have been convicted not for any confirmed crimes, but only because they are outstanding democratic leaders and representatives of the patriotic movement (this patriotic movement fought against the Hitler bandits and is now fighting against foreign occupation, against the Greek terrorist regime built on the bayonets of the US and Britain)."

　　Vyshinsky concluded: "If the Political Committee adopts a resolution that does not explicitly state that the Greek government is responsible for stopping the death sentences and rescinding the executions, these sentences will be carried out."

　　The meeting adjourned temporarily at this point without passing any resolutions.

　　雅典“内政”已出卖给美英　
    非法的处决必须停止
    乌克兰代表曼努意斯基强调地说：如果政治委员会的多数方面否决苏联的提案，那将意味着，政治委员会认可那进一步使希腊国内局势恶化的政策，而希腊国内正充满着能够使巴尔干和平遭受到威胁的严重的纠葛。
    苏联代表团团长维辛斯基在会议将近结束时最后一个起立作综合性的发言，详尽分析那些反对苏联提案的人们所表示的异议，并证明这些异议是不能自圆其说的。
    维辛斯基说：“三次会议以来，希腊代表一直执拗地企图劝说委员会相信，苏联代表团的建议是所谓干涉希腊内政。今日加拿大代表也这样说，但实际上，我们在这里丝毫没有干涉一个自主国家的内政。理由很简单，这就是现在希腊所代表的，不幸得很，不过是这个国家的主权的回忆罢了。这些人们业已不再是自主的，而且其内政已经出租给外国资本了，就谈不上干涉。希腊代表先生们，当乌克兰代表、我们同事曼努意斯基谈到这点的时候，你们并不高兴。而当波兰及捷克斯洛伐克代表谈到今日的希腊丢失了它的主权时，你们也是不高兴的。你们认为希腊现在是自主国。但是，美国驻希使团团长波特尔在他那个时候所说的话，你们如何看法呢？一九四七年九月二十日，美国柯里尔杂志发表了波特尔的一篇文章，作者在文章中对希腊局势作了颇真实的分析。波特尔写道：‘我认为，它（即曹达利斯的希腊政府）意欲利用外国的帮助来永远维持一小撮在希腊是微不足道的力量的那些银行家与商人底特权。在这种情况下，英国经常凭借了与当地统治阶级合作这一套公式，维护它们的剥削群众和用宪兵及皮鞭来镇压人民的这种权利，以此来买好它们’。前任美国驻希使团团长所写的这些话，是充分符合现实的，从这些话当中可以得出几个结论：第一、目前希腊没有自主权，因为雅典政府已为了美元而把这一自主权卖给英国人和美国人，就是近来，这些美元还大批源源不断地流入希腊政府的口袋里。第二、在此种情况下，希腊政府不是它国家的主人。第三、在这一情况下，人们谈不到什么干涉国家内政，因为它的内政只是‘虚妄’的。曹达利斯和比比聂列斯先生，所有你们的内政都是英美占领当局的事务。”
    维辛斯基接着说：“我最后提醒注意，我们在这里所要求的只是一件东西：我们要求停止非法的处决，我们要求停止处决九位不因任何确凿罪状而只因是卓越的民主领袖和爱国运动（这一爱国运动曾为反希特勒匪徒而斗争，而现在正为反对外国占领、反对那在美英刺刀上面建立起来的希腊恐怖主义政权而斗争着）的代表这一点而被判罪的希腊爱国者。”
    维辛斯基最后说：“如果政治委员会通过一项没有明确说出希腊政府有责任停止死刑判决和撤销处决的话，这些判决将被付诸执行的。”
    会议至此暂告休会，未通过任何决议。
