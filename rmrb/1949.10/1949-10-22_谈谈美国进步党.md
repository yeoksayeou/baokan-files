Talking About the American Progressive Party
    Chen Yingfu
    (III)

　　The emergence of the American Progressive Party in 1948 was another great movement by the American people to break away from the reactionary two-party system and strive for democracy and freedom. However, this movement, both in terms of its political significance and the posture and scope it exhibited, was completely different from previous ones. This is because it arose under the aforementioned characteristics of the current American situation; at the same time, the international environment was one of universal weakening of world capitalism and an unprecedented rise and strengthening of world people's democratic forces. It arose in response to the urgent needs of the American people; it will directly engage in struggle with the American reactionary forces, so its task is very arduous; at the same time, it should be a strong component of the international peace and democracy camp, so the international echo of its struggle's appeal is also huge and resounding.

　　The American Progressive Party is not a Labour Party, nor is it a party of workers and peasants, but a new type of people's party against war and against monopolies, a great united front of workers, peasants, black people, urban middle class, small industrialists and businessmen, professionals, ethnic minorities, and other broad masses of people striving for peace, democratic rights, and a reasonable life. This united front is not only very different in meaning and scope from previous third-party movements in the United States, but also completely different from the so-called "Roosevelt, Worker, Progressive Alliance" of the last decade or so. Because: First, the Roosevelt, Worker, Progressive Alliance operated within the Democratic Party; second, while that democratic alliance was externally opposed to the Nazi Axis, internally it only opposed the most reactionary part of monopoly capital, that is, the part that advocated appeasement of fascist states and opposed labor and Roosevelt's New Deal; third, that alliance was led by the anti-Axis part of the bourgeoisie. Conversely, today's people's united front is: first, it has broken away from the "two parties" used by monopoly capitalists and formed a people's mass party itself; second, today's Progressive Party not only opposes the Halssteads and Du Ponts who colluded with Roosevelt and supported the Nazis at that time, but also opposes all monopoly capitalists, because although these monopoly capitalists have some differences in factions, interests, and methods, they are basically the same in endangering peace and democracy and attempting to conquer the world; third, in this new people's united front, the working class will no longer, as in the "New Deal era," follow behind that part of the anti-Axis bourgeoisie, doing some trailing work, but will bravely stand in front of the people, playing a leading and backbone role.

　　At the same time, although the Progressive Party is an anti-monopoly, anti-fascist, and anti-war party, from its fundamental nature, it is not an anti-capitalist party. Of course, it is also not a socialist or communist party. Moreover, American progressives absolutely have no intention of turning it into such a party. However, although it is not a communist party, it absolutely does not oppose communism—or at least it should never oppose communism.

　　Today, there is only one Marxist party in the United States, only one party that fundamentally and thoroughly supports socialism and that capitalism will inevitably be defeated in the United States as well, and that is the Communist Party of the United States.

　　The CPUSA profoundly understands the special circumstances and conditions existing in the United States (the reactionary forces in the United States are still very strong at present; the political awareness of the American people is still not enough; the class consciousness and unity of the American working class are still not enough because they have been influenced by reactionary forces, especially the upper-level bureaucrats of reformist trade unions, etc.); profoundly understands that the United States now not only needs a strong vanguard party of the working class—the Communist Party, but also needs a broader people's party built on trade unions and other mass organizations of the people; this broader people's party will unite workers and progressives of different beliefs and social views to fight for current common interests and the current common goals of anti-monopoly and anti-war. At the same time, the CPUSA also profoundly understands that in the coming years, the political slogans and political goals of the American people should still be: "Elect and form a government that is anti-monopoly, anti-imperialist, and guarantees peace, security, and democracy"; however, this "people's government" is of course different from the Soviet government or the people's governments of the new democracies in Eastern Europe. Because, whether in terms of the objective situation in the United States or in terms of the strength contained in the current people's united front and the balance of power, it is still politically impossible to raise the standard that high; in other words, the task of such a government currently hoped for in the United States should only be and can only be to strongly curb the blind development of monopoly capital, and there is no question of fundamentally destroying the rule of monopoly capital, and therefore even less question of "immediately transitioning to socialism." Of course, the American people must not only maintain existing democratic rights, but should also further develop American democracy, opening the way for new social development.

　　The Communist Party of the United States, like its fraternal parties in other countries, is fighting on the one hand for the fundamental class interests and current interests of the American working class, and on the other hand precisely for the fundamental interests and current interests of the American people. Therefore, the CPUSA supports all progressive movements and all genuine worker and people's organizations. The American Progressive Party has a set of progressive programs, such as: domestically advocating price controls, a minimum wage of one dollar an hour, abolishing the reactionary Taft-Hartley Labor Act, prohibiting discrimination against black people, abolishing the civil service loyalty act and opposing compulsory military training and peacetime conscription, etc., and externally advocating genuine support for the United Nations, establishing world peace, strengthening Sino-Soviet friendship and cooperation, implementing universal disarmament of all countries through the United Nations, and opposing the Marshall Plan, while proposing the Wallace Plan: providing genuine assistance and reconstruction to the European economy through the United Nations, etc. The content of all these programs is broadly consistent and in line with the current program of the CPUSA. The Communist Party of the United States has its own current special tasks, and also has its current common general tasks with the anti-imperialist worker and progressive camp, and this common general task is to oppose war, oppose fascism, and strive for peace and freedom.

　　The CPUSA clearly recognizes the true characteristics of the current situation in the United States, so it uses its own political influence to resolutely launch and fully participate in and help establish a democratic anti-monopoly people's united front led by workers. However, the Wall Street monopoly capitalists then fabricated rumors and slandered that the Progressive Party was "manufactured" by the Communist Party and was a Communist "conspiracy." This is clearly a shameless deception. The Progressive Party was neither manufactured by the Communist Party nor a Communist conspiracy, but basically arose from the universal and urgent demands of the American people. The reason why the CPUSA wholeheartedly participates in and supports the Progressive Party is, on the one hand, because it is the most effective organizational method for the American people to defeat reaction, defeat fascism, and defeat war attempts at present, and on the other hand, because this new people's party can create favorable conditions for the historic struggle of workers leading all the people in the democratic movement. However, the CPUSA never attempts to "dominate" or "seize" this Progressive Party, nor does it hope that the Progressive Party will become a Communist Party, as the ruling class fabricates rumors and slanders. Because it is neither possible nor necessary to do so. Regardless of how the specific relationship between the CPUSA and the Progressive Party develops in the future, the CPUSA will firmly build its own party. The CPUSA soberly recognizes that when the working class enters a great anti-fascist and anti-war people's alliance, enters an alliance with other classes and their political representatives, it needs even more a vanguard party of its own class—the Communist Party—to lead it and organize it more strongly.

　　The CPUSA will never equate itself with the Progressive Party. There are fundamental differences and many tactical differences between the CPUSA and Wallace's Progressive Party. The CPUSA is a Marxist political party and firmly opposes the concept of "progressive capitalism"—as Wallace often touts. Of course, at present it is only a matter of curbing the development of monopoly capital; in the future, it must be a matter of fundamentally destroying the rule of monopoly capital. Returning to the "golden age" of free competition is an illusion. There is no "progressive capitalism" in the age of imperialism. Capitalism can no longer progress, and the United States will be no exception; after the rule of monopoly capital is destroyed, what will follow will be socialism!

　　At the same time, the CPUSA is of course resolutely and thoroughly opposed to imperialism, and it absolutely does not recognize that the Soviet Union should jointly bear responsibility with the United States for the war crisis—as Wallace often mentions.

　　The CPUSA believes that strengthening the Communist Party's own organization and struggle is also strengthening the strength of the people's united front; it believes that carrying out active and constructive criticism and struggle in the people's united front not only does not disperse or weaken the weight of the people's camp, but only makes it more progressive, more united, and more consolidated. The CPUSA is very vigilant to: on the one hand, resolutely fight against its own sectarianism, and on the other hand, never abandon its independent position and tasks and run to the people's camp to drift with the tide. We can always notice the vigorous new posture shown by the CPUSA after climbing up from the struggle with Browder's opportunism. Just to give an example: Last year, Mrs. Kimber, chairman of the National Wallace Women's Committee, once said to someone regarding the incident of a Soviet female teacher jumping off a building in New York: "I am not surprised by this incident. She certainly wanted to live in the United States. Who believes that there is still personal freedom in Russia!" Flynn (a female comrade), a member of the Central Committee of the CPUSA, immediately gave her an impolite head-on blow, pointing out: "Mrs. Kimber, although she is a progressive, she is a very wealthy woman. Her clothing and housing are extremely luxurious, and she has real estate in the countryside, with groups of servants and secretaries serving her; she has no worries about food and clothing, and of course she 'wants to live in the United States.' But she has not realized the real situation and status of women in the United States today, and she has not realized that the status of socialist women in the Soviet Union today, whether in social, economic, or political terms, is far superior to that of any other place in the world...." The words are righteous and stern, and she is not afraid of hurting the harmony of the united front.

    (IV)

　　The Progressive Party is still in the initial stage of vigorous development. There are still many difficulties and reefs ahead of it. Although it was specifically formed due to the most urgent needs of the American election struggle last year, it is of course not just for a temporary election; it will be a new long-term people's political organization in American politics. The American ruling class has spared no effort in attacking, dividing, slandering, and destroying it before the general election; after the general election, it has tried to take advantage of the temporary low tide of the people's democratic movement due to the setbacks suffered by the election results to destroy it in one fell swoop. At the same time, the various constituent parts of the Progressive Party are not all very solid and stable, and once exposed to wind and rain, it is inevitable that they will show wavering and division. Truman's election last year shows that the American people still adhere to the erroneous principle of "choosing the lesser of two evils." However, the undisguised reactionary essence of the Truman Democratic government, as well as its reactionary measures at home and abroad, and its breach of faith in violating the promises made during the general election, will greatly educate the American people. Therefore, as long as the leadership of the Progressive Party resolutely moves forward in several correct directions, then it will surely grow stronger day by day and eventually complete its historical tasks; because the common demands of the American people will only become more and more strong, more urgent, and more specific day by day, and will never cease or diminish. These several correct directions are:

　　First, the Progressive Party is a united front of workers, peasants, black people, urban middle class, small industrialists and businessmen, professionals, ethnic minorities, etc. They have the common goal of anti-imperialism and anti-monopoly; however, the reliability and firmness of these constituent elements are not the same. Therefore, the working class, which is the most determined and thorough in organizing, disciplining, and fighting against imperialism and monopoly, must gradually truly become the central backbone of the Progressive Party, become the cement and leading vanguard of the Progressive Party.

　　Second, do not fall for the trick of monopoly capital, get "communism phobia," and go down the road of anti-communism. Before last year's general election, a major spokesperson for the Progressive Party once said: If the Communist Party really wants to help the Progressive Party, it is best for the Communist Party to nominate its own presidential candidate separately—meaning do not get involved. Some even said that if this is done, the Progressive Party will lose at most 100,000 votes, but on the other hand, it can gain 3 million more votes.

　　This kind of statement is of course completely muddled. The correct direction of the Progressive Party is: not only should it not think or do this way, but it should resolutely reject this kind of rumor and slander, and resolutely welcome the Communist Party, this loyal and strong friendly army, to participate and work together.

　　Third, adhere to the basic line of anti-imperialism and do not go astray. Oppose the foreign aggression of American imperialism and shatter its dream of enslaving the world. Firmly grasp that the domestic policy and foreign policy of American imperialism are inseparable. Do not fantasize that you can compromise with American imperialism on foreign policy and still carry out effective struggles at home.

　　Fourth, adhere to and expand the united front of struggle, and gradually recognize that the basic nature of the people's united front is class struggle, is class struggle against monopoly capitalists, not class cooperation. Talking about "class cooperation" with monopoly capitalists—as the traitor Browder of the CPUSA used to advocate—will only help the tyrant to do evil and lead to war and fascism. So-called class struggle means that every conspiracy and every attack by fascists and warmongers must be exposed and countered; whether political or economic, whether domestic or foreign. The so-called "class cooperation" should be vigilant to its various forms of existence. One of the most dangerous hidden forms of "class cooperation" is when the reactionaries concentrate their fire on attacking the Communist Party or attacking a trade union or a mass organization, while other allies, other trade unions, or other organizations stand by and watch, indifferent, and even have a mentality of watching the excitement. The policy of the united front of struggle should be closely guarded against the enemy's attempts to defeat them one by one; at the same time, all leaders, all groups, all mass organizations, as long as they are anti-war and anti-fascist, regardless of other differences, should be brought in, concentrating firepower to strike the most vicious common enemy—the forces of monopoly capital.

　　These are the specific topics of the American people at present and in the near future.

　　The American Republican Party and the Democratic Party are a pair of twins of monopoly capital. They are parties that are anti-labor, anti-people, anti-Soviet, and anti-all progressive forces in the world. In contrast, the American Progressive Party is a party of the people; it has a progressive program that is anti-war, anti-monopoly, domestically advocates controlling capital profits, improving the people's economic life, maintaining all democratic freedoms and equal rights, and externally insists on friendly cooperation with the Soviet Union, genuinely supports the United Nations, and opposes supporting the reactionary parties of various countries. The emergence of the Progressive Party, on the one hand, shows that: although the strength of monopoly capital and the two parties it uses still seems relatively strong on the surface at present, the emergence of a new mass people's party shows that a big crack has occurred in the political strength of monopoly capital; even if they can achieve temporary victories, they will inevitably accelerate their path to collapse from this crack. On the other hand, as far as the Progressive Party itself is concerned, although it is still a nascent force, although it is still being hit by monopoly capital everywhere and betrayed and obstructed by reformist spies, if it can adhere to the above-mentioned directions, that is, adhere to its progressive program, adhere to the policy of expanding the united front, adhere to the line of striving for labor unity and taking labor as the basic force, and adhere to rejecting the intimidation and threats of "red terror" and other divisive conspiracies, then although it will suffer temporary setbacks and obstacles, it will eventually unite more and broader people and achieve victory tomorrow with the American working class.

　　谈谈美国进步党
    陈英父
    （三）
    一九四八年美国进步党的产生，是美国人民再一次脱离反动的两党制度争取民主自由的伟大运动。但是这一次的运动，无论在政治意义上讲，或在他所表现的姿态与范围上讲，都与以前的几次完全不同。因为它是产生在具有前述特点的美国当前情势之下；同时国际环境，是世界资本主义普遍衰弱，世界人民民主力量空前高涨空前壮大的一个局面。它是适应美国人民当前的急迫需要而产生的；它将与美国反动势力直接展开搏斗，因此他的任务是十分艰巨的；同时，它应该是国际和平民主阵营的一个有力的组成部分，因此它的奋斗的呼吁所得到的国际回声也是巨大而洪亮的。
    美国进步党，不是一个工党，也不是一个工农的党，而是一个新型的反战争反独占的人民的政党，是一个工、农、黑人、城市中产阶级、小工商业者、自由职业者、少数民族等等广大人民群众争取和平、争取民主权利争取合理生活的一个伟大的统一战线。这个统一战线不但与美国以前历次的第三党运动在意义与范围上都十分不同，即与最近十几年以来的所谓“罗斯福、工人、进步分子的联盟”也完全不同。因为：第一、罗斯福、工人、进步分子的联盟是在民主党的范围之内运用工作的；第二、当时那种民主的联盟对外固然是反对纳粹轴心，对内只是反对独占资本中最反动的那部分，即主张绥靖法西斯主义国家并反对劳工反对罗斯福新政的那部分；第三、当时那个联盟是由反轴心的那一部分资产阶级所领导的。反之，今天的人民的统一战线则是第一、脱离了独占资本家所运用的“两党”而自身形成了一个人民的群众的政党；第二、今天的进步党不但是反对当时同罗斯福捣蛋拥护纳粹的哈尔斯特、杜邦等等，而且是反对所有一切的独占资本家，因为这些独占资本家虽也有一些派别、权益、手法的不同，但是基本上危害和平民主，企图征服全世界则是同一的；第三、在这个新的人民的统一战线当中，工人阶级将不再象“新政时期”一样，跟在那部分反轴心的资产阶级的后面，做些尾随的工作，而是要英勇地站在人民的前面，发挥领导的中坚作用。
    同时，进步党虽然是一个反独占、反法西斯、反战争的政党，但是从它的根本性质上讲，却并不是一个反资本主义的政党。当然它也就不是一个社会主义的或共产主义的党。并且，美国的进步人士也绝对无意把它变成这样的一个政党。不过它虽不是共产主义的党，它也绝不反共，——或至少说它也绝不应该反共。
    今天美国只有一个马克思主义的党，只有一个基本上彻底拥护社会主义终必在美国也将战胜资本主义的党，那便是美国共产党。
    美共深刻地了解美国现存的特殊的情形与条件（美国反动势力在当前还是很强大的；美国人民的政治觉悟程度还很不够；美国工人阶级因为受了反动势力的影响、特别是改良主义的工会上层官僚分子的影响以致阶级觉悟与团结的程度还很不够等等）；深刻地了解美国现在不但需要一个强大的工人阶级的先锋政党——共产党，而且也需要一个建筑在工会以及其他的人民的群众组织之上的更广泛的人民的政党；这个更广泛的人民的政党将团结不同信仰不同社会观的工人及进步分子，为当前的共同利益与当前的反独占反战争的共同目标而奋斗。同时，美共也正是深刻地了解到：在未来数年内，美国人民的政治口号同政治目标仍应该是：“选举并组成一个反独占、反帝国主义、保障和平、安全、与民主的政府”；但是，这个“人民的政府”当然也不同于苏联政府或东欧的新民主的人民的政府。因为，无论就美国的客观情形或就目前人民统一战线中所包含的力量以及力量的对比而言，都还在政治上不能提得那样高；换一句话说，目前所期望的这样一个政府，在美国当前的任务，只应该是而且只能是强烈地抑制独占资本的盲目发展，而还谈不到根本破坏独占资本的统治，因此也就更谈不到“马上转变到社会主义”。当然，美国人民不但要维护现有的民主权利，而且应该使美国的民主得到进一步的发展，为新的社会发展开辟道路。
    美国共产党，正如其他国家的兄弟党一样，一方面是为了美国工人阶级的基本的阶级利益与当前的利益而奋斗，一方面也正是为了美国人民的基本利益以及当前的利益而奋斗。因此，美共支持所有的进步性的运动，支持所有的真正的工人以及人民的组织。美国进步党有一套进步的纲领，如象：对内主张管制物价，一小时一块美金的最低工资，取消反动的塔夫——哈特莱劳工法案，禁止歧视黑人，取消公务员忠诚法案并反对强迫军训及和平时期征兵等等，对外主张真正拥护联合国、建立世界和平、加强美苏友谊与合作、通过联合国实行各国的普遍裁减军备，并反对马歇尔计划、而提出了华莱士计划：通过联合国进行对欧洲经济的真实援助与复兴等等。所有这些纲领的内容，大体上是与美共的当前纲领相吻合相一致的。美国共产党有它当前自身的特殊的任务，也有它当前与反帝的工人进步分子阵营共同的一般任务，这个共同的一般的任务便是反战、反法西斯、争取和平与自由。
    美共清楚地认识到当前美国形势的真实特点，于是用它自身的政治影响，坚决发动并且全力参加，帮助建立一个以工人为领导的民主的反独占的人民的统一战线。但是，因此华尔街独占资本家便造谣诬蔑说进步党是共产党“制造”的，是共产党的“阴谋”。这显然是无耻的欺人之谈。进步党既不是共产党制造的，也不是共产党的阴谋，而基本上是从美国人民大众普遍的急迫的要求中产生的。美共所以全心全力参加并且支持进步党，一方面因为它是美国人民当前击败反动击败法西斯与战争企图的最有效的组织方式，一方面也因为这一新的人民的政党，可以为工人领导全体人民进行民主运动的历史斗争，创造有利的条件。但是美共绝不企图“统治”或者“夺取”这个进步党，也绝不希望进步党变成共产党，如象统治阶级造谣诬蔑的那样。因为要这样办，既不可能，也无必要。美共同进步党的具体关系，不管以后如何发展，美共将坚强地建设自己的党。美共清醒地认识到：当工人阶级进入一个反法西斯反战争的人民大联合、进入一个同别的阶级以及它们的政治代表们的联盟的时候，它就更需要一个本阶级的先锋的政党——共产党，来领导它并且将它更坚强地组织起来。
    美共是绝不把它自己同进步党来划等号的。美共与华莱士的进步党是有基本的不同与许多策略上的差异的。美共是一个马克思主义的政党，坚决反对什么“进步的资本主义”的概念——如象华莱士时常标榜的。当然，目前还只是抑制独占资本的发展；而将来则必须是根本摧毁独占资本的统治。再回到自由竞争的“黄金时代”，那是一个幻想。帝国主义时代没有什么“进步的资本主义”。资本主义是再不能进步了，美国绝不能例外；独占资本的统治摧毁之后，接踵而来的将是社会主义！
    同时，美共当然是坚决彻底地反对帝国主义的，它绝不承认苏联应该与美国对战争的危机共同负责——如象华莱士时常提到的那样。
    美共认为加强共产党本身的组织及斗争的力量，也正是加强人民的统一战线的力量；认为在人民的统一战线中进行积极的建设性的批评与斗争，不但不是分散或减弱人民阵营的分量，反而只有使它更进步、更团结、更巩固。美共十分警惕到：一方面要坚决地与自身的宗派主义相斗争，一方面也绝不抛弃自己的独立的地位与任务而跑到人民阵营中去随波逐流。我们随时留意，便可以发现美共从与白劳德机会主义的斗争中爬起来之后所表现的生气勃勃的新姿态。随便举一个例子：去年，美全国拥护华莱士妇女委员会主席靳伯尔夫人某次对于苏联女教员在纽约跳楼事件曾对人说：“我并不惊讶这个事件。她当然愿意生活在美国。谁相信俄国还有个人的自由啊！”美共中央委员弗琳（一位女同志）马上给她一个毫不客气的迎头痛击，指明：“靳伯尔夫人，虽然是一个进步分子，但是她却是一个极富裕的女人。她的衣住都极其豪华奢侈，在乡间还有地产，仆从秘书之流成群伺候；她不愁吃不愁穿，当然是‘愿意生活在美国’的。可是她却没有了解到今天美国妇女的真实情况同地位，她更没有了解到今日苏联社会主义妇女无论在社会上经济政治上的地位，远较世界其他任何一个地方都要优越……”。可谓义正词严，绝不怕伤了统一战线的和气。
    （四）
    进步党还在蓬蓬勃勃发展的初期。它的前面还是有很多困难与暗礁的。它虽然是由于美国去年选举斗争的最紧迫的需要而具体组成，但是它当然绝不只是为了一时的选举；它将是美国政治上一个新的长久的人民的政治组织。美国统治阶级在大选以前对它的攻击、分化、诬蔑、破坏已经不遗余力；大选以后更图借着人民民主运动因选举结果受到一时的挫折而处于低潮的时候，一鼓而摧毁之。同时，进步党内部的各组成部分并不都是十分坚固稳定的，一经风吹雨打，难免不显现动摇分裂。去年杜鲁门的当选，是说明美国的老百姓还关于“两害择其轻”的错误原则。但是，杜鲁门民主党政府的不可掩饰的反动实质，以及它对内对外的反动措施、违背大选时所许下的诺言的背信行为，将大大地教育了美国人民。所以，只要进步党的领导坚决地朝着几个正确的方向向前发展，那么它一定可以一天一天健壮强大，终必完成其历史的任务；因为美国人民的共同要求，只有一天一天更强烈，更急迫，更具体，绝不会中止或消减的。这几个正确的方向便是：
    第一、进步党是一个工、农、黑人、城市中产阶级、小工商业者、自由职业者、少数民族等等的统一战线，他们有反帝反独占的共同奋斗目标；但是这些组成分子的可靠性与坚定性却不是一样的。因此，有组织有纪律反帝反独占最坚决彻底的工人阶级就必须渐渐真实成为进步党的中心骨干，成为进步党的水门汀及领导先锋。
    第二、不要中了独占资本的奸计，犯了“恐共病”，走到反共的路上去。去年大选以前，有一位进步党的主要发言人就曾经说过：如果共产党真想帮助进步党的话，最好共产党另外自己推选一位总统候选人——意思是不要扯在一起。甚至有人说，如果这样办的话，进步党顶多损失十万张票，但是另一方面却可以多得三百万票。
    这种说法当然是糊涂透顶的。进步党的正确方向是：非但不应该这样想这样办，而且要坚决地拒斥这种造谣中伤，坚决地欢迎共产党这一忠实的坚强的友军参加进来，共同努力奋斗。
    第三、坚持反帝国主义的基本路线，不要走到斜路上去。反对美帝国主义的对外侵略，击碎它的奴役世界的梦想。紧紧地掌握住：美帝的对内政策同对外政策是不可分的。不要幻想同美帝在对外政策上可以妥协、而在国内还可以作有效的斗争。
    第四、坚持并扩大斗争的统一战线，并渐渐认识人民的统一战线的基本性质是阶级斗争，是对于独占资本家的阶级斗争，而不是阶级合作。与独占资本家讲“阶级合作”——如象美共的叛徒白劳德以前所主张的，则结果只有助纣为虐，走向战争与法西斯。所谓阶级斗争，就是要向法西斯主义者同战争贩子的每一个阴谋每一个进攻都要进行揭穿进行反击；无论是政治的还是经济的，无论是对内的还是对外的。所谓“阶级合作”，应该警惕它的各种方式的存在。“阶级合作”的一个最危险的隐藏的方式，就是当反动派集中火力进攻共产党或进攻某一个工会某一个群众团体的时候，而别的同盟军别的工会或别的团体却袖手旁观，淡然处之，甚且有看热闹的心理。斗争的统一战线的方针，应该紧防敌人来各个击破；同时，却应该将所有的领袖，所有的集团，所有的群众组织，只要它是反战争反法西斯，不管其他的差别，都网罗进来，集中火力、打击最凶狠的共同敌人——独占资本势力。
    这便是美国人民当前与最近将来的具体课题。
    美国共和党同民主党，是独占资本的一对孪生子。它们是反劳工反人民反苏联反世界上一切进步力量的政党。相反的，美国进步党是一个人民群众的政党；它有一个反战争、反独占、对内主张控制资本利润、提高人民经济生活、维护一切民主自由与平权，对外坚持与苏联友好合作，名副其实地拥护联合国，并反对支持各国反动派的进步纲领。进步党的产生，一方面说明了：尽管独占资本以及它所运用的两党的力量在目前表面上还似乎比较强大，但是一个新的群众的人民政党的产生，是说明独占资本的政治力量发生了一个大大的裂痕；即便他们还可以取得一时的胜利，他们终究不可避免地将从这个裂痕加速地走向崩溃的道路。另外一方面就进步党本身来讲，虽然它还是一个新生的力量，虽然它还到处受到独占资本的打击以及改良主义派奸细的出卖与阻挠，但是它如果能够坚持上述的几个方向，即坚持它的进步纲领，坚持扩大的统一战线的方针，坚持争取劳工团结劳工并以劳工为基本力量的路线，并坚持拒斥“赤色恐怖”的恫吓威胁等分化阴谋，则它虽然受到暂时的挫折与阻难，但终将团结更多更广大的人民随着美国工人阶级取得明日的胜利。
