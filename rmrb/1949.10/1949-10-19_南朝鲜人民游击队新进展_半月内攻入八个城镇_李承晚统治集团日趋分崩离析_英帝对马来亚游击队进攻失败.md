Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 18th: The South Korean people's guerrilla war has made considerable progress in the past half month. People's guerrilla forces in various places have successively captured the towns of Naju, Jangheung, Cheolpyeong, Gwangju, Mojin, Gokseong in Jeolla Province, and Andong, Yeongju in North Gyeongsang Province, and launched street battles with the puppet national defense forces and police in these areas. The People's Guerrilla forces also continuously attacked puppet police stations and district offices. When the Minister of Internal Affairs of the Syngman Rhee government answered inquiries in the puppet National Assembly, he had to admit that the security of the reactionary rule in South Korea was "increasingly chaotic." Inside the puppet national defense forces of the Syngman Rhee government, disintegration is increasing. On the one hand, officers and soldiers of the South Korean puppet army continue to revolt and head north, and on the other hand, senior generals in the puppet army are fighting for power and backstabbing each other. Recently, Chae Byeong-deok, the puppet "Chief of the Army General Staff," and Kim Seok-won, the commander of the 1st Division who provoked the "38th Parallel" incident, were dismissed by Syngman Rhee due to mutual competition for military command.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 18th: Reuters, London, 17th: A report in the London Times on the Malaya war situation clearly illustrates the complete failure of the recent British offensive against Malayan guerrillas. The newspaper's battle report summarized the results of the "campaign" conducted in September by seventeen infantry battalions, one field artillery regiment, and one armored regiment. The newspaper admitted that "the situation is now almost the same as before the campaign began." News dispatches prove that the general situation is "disappointing" for the imperialists. One message said, "There is nothing better to report."

　　南朝鲜人民游击队新进展
  　半月内攻入八个城镇
    李承晚统治集团日趋分崩离析
  　英帝对马来亚游击队进攻失败
    【新华社平壤十八日电】南朝鲜人民游击战争，在最近半月内获得颇大的进展。各地人民游击队曾先后攻入全罗南道的罗州、长兴、哲平、光州、帽城、谷城、庆尚北道的安东、荣州等城镇，并与各该地的伪国防军和警察展开了巷战。人民游击队并不断袭击伪警察署和区公所。李承晚政府内务部长在伪国会答复询问时，不得不承认南朝鲜反动统治的治安“日益陷于混乱”。李承晚政府的伪国防军内部，则日趋分崩离析。一方面是南朝鲜伪军中的官兵不断起义北上，另一方面是伪军中高级将领间的争权夺利，彼此倾轧。最近，伪“陆军总参谋长”蔡秉德和指挥“三八线”挑拨事件的第一师团长金石元，即因互争军事统辖权而被李承晚免职。
    【新华社北京十八日电】电通社伦敦十七日讯：伦敦泰晤士报关于马来亚战况的报道，清楚地说明了最近英国对马来亚游击队攻势的完全失败。该报的战报总结了九月份由十七个步兵营、一个野炮团及一个装甲团所进行的“战役”的结果。该报承认“现在的情况几乎和战役开始以前一样”。新闻电讯证明，一般的情况对帝国主义者说来是“失望”的。有一条消息说，“毫无好转可以报道”。
