　　Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 22nd -- Du Anliang, a technician at the Zhejiang Telecom Bureau, after a month and a half of dedicated research, has successfully modified the bureau's original 3-channel carrier equipment used for long-distance telephone calls into 6-channel carrier equipment, doubling the efficiency of the long-distance telephone equipment and lines. The East China Telecom General Bureau has awarded a special commendation and called on telecom employees to learn from him. Due to a shortage of equipment, the bureau's long-distance telephone lines were very congested; furthermore, the carrier equipment used for long-distance telephone calls were all imported, and China could not manufacture them domestically. After liberation, technician Du Anliang realized that technology should serve the people. Therefore, in response to the higher authorities' call to overcome equipment difficulties, he began to modify the original 3-channel carrier equipment into 6-channel carrier equipment using existing materials a month and a half ago. His enthusiasm and modification plan were immediately approved and encouraged by the bureau's leadership, and he received assistance from technicians at the Hangzhou, Ningbo, and Lanxi equipment stations. During the modification process, he encountered many difficulties and some people's cynicism, but he worked tirelessly and finally succeeded in the experiment. A 3-channel carrier equipment with thirty or forty vacuum tubes and twenty filter sets can be modified into a 6-channel carrier equipment by simply adding six vacuum tubes and twelve filter sets; in the past, one pair of copper wires could only allow four families to talk simultaneously, but after the modification, it can allow seven families to talk simultaneously, and the sound is clear.

    改装三路载波机为六路载波机         
    华东电信局特予嘉奖
    【新华社杭州二十二日电】浙江电信管理局技术员都安良，经一个半月的苦心钻研，已将该局原有的一部长途电话用的三路载波机，改装为六路载波机，使长途电话的机器和线路的效能提高一倍。华东电信总局特予嘉奖，并号召电信员工向他学习。该局长途电话由于机器少，线路十分拥挤；长途电话使用的载波机又全为舶来品，我国不能自造。该局技术员都安良在解放后认识到技术要为人民服务，因此响应上级关于克服器材困难的号召，在一个半月以前利用现有材料着手将原有的三路载波机试行改装为六路载波机。他的热情和改装计划，立刻得到该局领导人员的同意和鼓励，并获得杭州、宁波、兰溪等机务站的技术员的协助。改装中遇到很多困难和一些人的冷嘲热讽，但他毫不灰心地工作，终于试验成功。一部装有三、四十只真空管和二十副滤波器的三路载波机，只须加添六只真空管和十二副滤波器就可改装成六路载波机使用；过去一付铜线只能供四家同时通话，改装后可供七家同时通话，而且声音清晰。
