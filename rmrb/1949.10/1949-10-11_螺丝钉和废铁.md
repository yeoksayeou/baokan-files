　　Screw and Scrap Iron
　　Xia Yuan
　　In a very, very large factory, in the corner of the wall next to the spinning lathe that turned day and night, sat a perfectly good screw, and next to him lay a piece of scrap iron, lazing about.
　　The screw had been abandoned by a careless worker before liberation, and no one remembered him anymore; the same was true of the scrap iron, no one had glanced at him for years.
　　The screw was not so passive. After liberation, he particularly longed for someone to take care of him and assign him to a machine so he could work actively. How much he liked the factory today! After so many years of loneliness and hardship, the factory now had free smiles and happy songs. If he didn't participate in the work now, when would he wait? Alas! The screw was truly impatient.
　　"Look at Little Zhang, who used to make only fifty screw caps a day, now makes two hundred and sixty a day. Old Liu used to doze all day long, but now he's become young, like a tiger! And I'm still sitting here, how anxious I am!"
　　After saying this, the screw sighed deeply.
　　The scrap iron yawned and said with disgust:
　　"It's so boring! So boring! It's best not to meddle in those trivial matters of the world. Nothing is more comfortable than sleeping. I hope no one sees me, let alone moves me..."
　　The electric roller sang his victory tirelessly, the wide, narrow, long, and short belts rotated quickly; the planer and the milling machine shouted loudly. The screw's full of wishes and the scrap iron’s negative complaints, no one heard.
　　The screw eagerly hoped every day that someone would discover him and send him to work on the machine. Whenever a worker approached, he cheered, radiated light, and shouted loudly:
　　"I'm here! I'm not disabled! I'm still good! Give me work quickly..."
　　The sounds of the electric roller, belts, planer, and milling machine were too loud, and his request was not heard by anyone, so he was sad and sighed. But he believed that sooner or later a worker would find him and invite him to go.
　　The old scrap iron often mocked him with a contemptuous tone:
　　"What important work can a small screw do? If you are pressed on a large machine, you won't even show a shadow, and no one will value you, so I say it's better to sleep!"
　　The screw retorted:
　　"Don't look down on me because I'm small, my role is very important!"
　　The stubborn scrap iron snorted disgustedly and continued to sleep.
　　The screw did not wait in vain, his opportunity finally came. One day, a worker who used to refuse to pick up an overturned oil bottle was cleaning the factory very carefully. The screw, under the lively and diligent push of his broom, turned over, rolled a few times, and sat in a place bathed in sunlight. The worker saw him as if he saw a relative, quickly picked him up, brought him close to his nose, blew on him a few times, wiped off the dirt, and placed him on a clean long table, together with a group of fat hammers and pliers. The screw was extremely happy and said to himself:
　　"This time I've got my chance!"
　　From then on, he held even greater hope and waited patiently in the harmonious and uplifting mechanical sound. In about half a month, the worker moved him to a rich material box, and soon after, he moved him to a plate inlaid with iron sheets. After the factory held a meeting on the democratization of production management, the worker gave him a good oil bath, pressed him on the machine, and he worked with a hundredfold enthusiasm.
　　Time passed quickly, and half a year passed in the blink of an eye. The screw had never been uneasy about his work. As long as the worker turned on the power, he would work hard with his other part brothers. During breaks, he greeted the scrap iron who was still sleeping in the corner:
　　"Old Brother Scrap Iron, don't you want to ask for work yet?"
　　The scrap iron glanced at him listlessly:
　　"Nothing is better than sleeping, don't mind me!"
　　"That was right in the past, but now it's different, listen to me..."
　　"No need to tell me, I want to sleep."
　　He started snoring and fell asleep.
　　The lathe that the screw was working on used to be very lazy before liberation and never worked properly. Now the workers give him an oil bath every day, wiping him clean and bright, how can he not work fast? The screw worked with greater enthusiasm, the old workers liked him, the young workers liked him, and the apprentices also liked him.
　　Two weeks ago, a group of students came to visit the factory. They all looked at him with admiration and respect. Some students even carefully touched him with their hands. One student pointed to him and said to other students:
　　"We should learn from the screw and play the role of a screw in the revolutionary work."
　　How happy the screw must have been to hear this! All the machine parts were also happy, and the electric roller and belts sang louder and the sound was more resonant and moving.
　　The old scrap iron, sleeping until recently, was discovered by the workers. When they picked him up and looked at him, they found that he had been sleeping for too many years and was so rusted that he was unrecognizable. He was not qualified for large-scale use, and he himself refused to be used on a small scale. There was no way but to throw him in the scrap iron pile. Sometimes this worker came over to rummage, and sometimes that worker came over to lift him, but no one paid attention to him. He wanted to sleep, but he couldn't sleep comfortably anymore - at this time, he regretted that he was really useless.

### 螺丝钉和废铁

　　螺丝钉和废铁
    夏园
    在一个很大很大的工厂里，在那成天到晚转动着的旋床子旁边的墙角下，坐着一位完好无损的螺丝钉，在他旁边还懒洋洋的躺着一位废铁。
    螺丝钉是从解放以前就被干活不大细心的工友遗弃了的，早已没有谁再惦念他了；那块废铁也是如此，多少年来没有人看他一眼。
    螺丝钉可不是这样消极的，他在解放以后特别渴想着谁来照顾他，把他分配在机器上好积极的工作。他是多么喜欢今天的工厂啊！多少年来都是寂寞苦重的厂子里，现在有了自由的笑脸，有了幸福的歌声。这时再不参加工作，还等待什么时候呢？唉唉！螺丝钉可真急的有些忍耐不住。
    “你看小张，从前一天才干五十个螺丝帽，现在一天能做二百六十，刘老头从前老是成天到晚打瞌睡，现在变得年轻了，就象生龙活虎一般！我还坐在这里，多么着急呀！”
    螺丝钉这样说过以后，就长长的喘着粗气。
    废铁打了一个哈欠，厌恨的说：
    “无聊得很！无聊得很！顶好是不要过问人间那些闲事，干什么也不如睡觉舒服，我盼望谁也不看见我，更不要动我……”
    电滚老是不休不息的歌唱着他的胜利，宽的、窄的、长的、短的皮带风快的旋转着；刨床子、洗床子都拿出很大的声音呼喊。螺丝钉的满腔愿望，废铁的消极的牢骚话，谁也没有听见。
    螺丝钉天天都在热烈的盼望着有人发现他，派他到机器上面去工作。每逢有的工友走近了，他就欢欣鼓舞，光芒四射，大声呼叫：
    “我在这里呀！我没有残废呀！还是好好的呀！快给我工作……”
    电滚、皮带、刨床子、洗床子们的声音太大，他的请求，没有被谁听见，于是他就忧愁、叹息。但是他相信早早晚晚会有工友发现了他，把他请去。
    废铁老先生时常带着轻蔑的口气嘲笑着说：
    “你一个小螺丝钉能干什么了不得的工作呢？把你按在大机器上，连个影子也露不出来，谁也不会重视你的，所以我说还是睡觉的好！”
    螺丝钉反驳他说：
    “别看我小，我的作用倒很大呢！”
    顽固的废铁憎恶的哼了一声，继续睡觉去了。
    螺丝钉是没有白盼望的，他的机会终于到了。有一天，有一个从前看见油瓶子倒了也不肯扶起的工友非常细致的打扫厂子，螺丝钉就在他活泼勤快的帚笤推动下翻了一个大身，滚了几滚，坐到浴着阳光的地方。工友看见了他好象看见了亲人一样，赶紧把他拾起，靠近鼻尖，吹了几吹，抚去泥土，按排在干净的长案子上，和一群肥胖的锤子，钳子靠在一起。螺丝钉快乐极了，自言自语的说：
    “这回我可有了出头的日子了！”
    从此他就抱着更大的希望，在和谐昂扬的机械声中耐心的等着。大概不到半个月的光景，工友把他移到丰富的材料箱里，过了不久，他又迁到镶着铁片的板上。工厂开过生产管理民主化的会以后，工友就把他用油好好的洗了一个澡，按在机器上面，他就百倍兴奋的干起来了。
    时间过的真快，转眼半年过去，螺丝钉从来没有不安心工作的情形。只要工友把电门一开，他就协同其他零件兄弟们埋头苦干。休息的时候，他对着仍在墙角昏睡的废铁招呼：
    “废铁老兄，你还不要求工作么？”
    废铁无精打采的瞥了他一眼：
    “干什么也不如睡觉，不用管我！”
    “从前那样是对的，现在可就不同啦，你听我说……。”
    “用不着你说，我还要睡觉。”
    打起鼾声，睡过去了。
    螺丝钉工作着的那盘床子，解放以前是顶懒惰的，从来也不好好的干活，现在工友天天用油给他洗澡，混身上下，擦的明光钻亮，干起活来，怎能不快？螺丝钉越干劲头越大，老工友喜欢他，年青的工友喜欢他，学徒也喜欢他。
    两个星期以前，来了一队学生参观工厂，他们都用羡慕与尊敬的眼光望着他，有的学生还用手小心的摸摸他，一个学生指着他对别的同学说：
    “我们应该学习螺丝钉，在革命工作中起螺丝钉的作用。”
    螺丝钉听了这话该有多么高兴啊！所有的机器零件也都高兴，电滚、皮带，唱的更响、音韵更加响亮和动人了。
    废铁老兄睡到最近，被工友发现了，拿起一看，睡的年头太多，锈的不成样子，往大处用，实在不够资格，往小处用，他自己又不肯，没有办法，只好扔在破铁堆里。有时这个工友过来翻弄翻弄，有时那个工友过来掀动掀动，谁也不理会他。他想睡觉，也睡不舒服了，——到了这时，他才后悔自己实在没有出息。
