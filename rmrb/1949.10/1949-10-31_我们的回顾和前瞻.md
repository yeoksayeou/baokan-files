　　Our Review and Outlook
    Deng Jixing, Chen Mingde
    (Editor's Note) The General Management Office of Xinmin Daily has moved from Nanjing to Beijing and decided to start working at the new address, No. 34 West Guanyin Temple, Dongdan, from November 1st. Chen Mingde, General Manager of the General Management Office of the newspaper, and Deng Jixing, Assistant Manager and Manager of the Beijing Office, have specially written this article to be published in various newspapers.

    In this great new era of the People's Republic of China, Xinmin Daily can still have the opportunity to serve the people as a private newspaper under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, which is an unparalleled honor.

    Xinmin Daily has a history of twenty years. In these twenty years of its life, it has indeed experienced a period of difficult and arduous struggle. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the traitorous and anti-people behavior of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits intensified. In the past four years, the various newspaper offices of our Xinmin Daily have suffered from the oppression, attacks, and destruction of the reactionary government. In the eyes of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary regime, Xinmin Daily has always been its enemy. After the great victory of the People's Liberation War, the People's Government reviewed the history of Xinmin Daily and believed that Xinmin Daily could still strive for progress. Therefore, it was given the opportunity to innovate, improve, and continue to work hard to serve the people. We are both grateful and deeply inspired. In all fairness, in the past, many colleagues in various offices of Xinmin Daily were indeed progressive in their thinking and had a spirit of struggle. Their many sacrifices have earned the newspaper today's glory. Xinmin Daily has been able to maintain its progressive essence, and this achievement should be attributed to them. On the other hand, Xinmin Daily has also made many major mistakes in its twenty years. In an attempt to prolong the life of the newspaper, we have made many unprincipled compromises with the Kuomintang reactionaries, and our speeches have also echoed reactionaries in many places. Looking back today, we feel that all of this is the responsibility of our short-sightedness and incompetent leadership.

    We have both been in Beijing for nearly half a year. This time we came to the north, and we personally resolved to learn from scratch and thoroughly transform ourselves. After this period of study and self-examination, we dare not claim to have made real progress, but we both have a common feeling, that is, we feel that we have broken away from the fog, seen the light, and found the right path from the maze. Looking back today, some actions that we thought were right in the past, we now know are wrong. For example, Mingde once served as a representative of the pseudo-National Assembly, and Jixing once served as a member of the Legislative Yuan of the Monk. At that time, we still explained it to each other as a cover for the work of the newspaper. Facts have proved that this was an unclear understanding and a completely wrong fantasy at the time. For the extremely vicious reactionaries, just like Wu Song facing the tiger on Jingyang Ridge, what he should do is only how to kill the tiger, and he must not seek its "favor" and deal with it hypocritically. We feel pain and shame for this mistake.

    In this great era of the People's Republic of China, everyone has the opportunity to start anew, which is really fortunate. We are willing to learn and start from scratch. Today, we both feel that continuing to undertake the work of Xinmin Daily is a very important responsibility. We are determined to stand under the banner of New Democracy, absolutely follow the guidance of the People's Government, absolutely grasp and adhere to correct thinking, and run Xinmin Daily well. We must work together with all colleagues of this newspaper to make Xinmin Daily a newspaper that can truly serve the people. This is our only aspiration and way of striving in the future.

　　我们的回顾和前瞻
    邓季惺　陈铭德
    （编者按）新民报总管理处已经从南京迁移到了北京，并决定从十一月一日起，在东单西观音寺三十四号新址开始办公。该报总管理处总经理陈铭德，协理兼北京社经理邓季惺两人，特撰此文送各报发表。
    在中华人民共和国这个伟大的新时代中，新民报仍然能够以私营报纸的身份，在毛主席与中国共产党领导之下，继续得到为人民服务的机会，这真是无尚的光荣。
    新民报有了二十年的历史。在他这二十年的生命中，的确有过一段艰难困苦的奋斗。抗战胜利后，蒋匪叛祖国、反人民的行为，变本加厉。最近四年来，我们新民报的各地报馆，受尽了反动政府的压迫、打击与摧残。在蒋逆反动政权的眼光中，新民报始终是他的敌人。人民解放战争伟大胜利后，人民政府考核新民报的历史后，认为新民报还可以向进步方面努力。因此给以革新改进而继续努力为人民服务的机会，我们庆幸之余，深为感奋。平心而论，以往新民报各地的工作同人中，的确有不少思想进步而具有斗争精神的人士，凭他们的许多牺牲，换来了报馆今天的光荣，新民报得以保持进步本质，这功绩应属于他们。从另一方面来说：二十年的新民报，也犯过许多重大错误，因为企图苟延报纸的生命，我们对于国民党反动派作过不少无原则的妥协，我们的言论中也有不少附和反动的地方。今天反省起来，觉得这一切都是我们两人识见短浅，领导无方的责任。
    我们两人先后来到北京已近半年了。我们这次北来，个人抱定从头学习彻底改造的决心。经过这个学习与自我检讨时期，不敢自认有了真正进步，但我们两人都有了一个共同感想，即感觉着我们已经脱离了迷雾，看见了光明，从迷途中找到了正路。今天回想起来，有些行动，过去或自以为是者，今知其非。举例来说：铭德曾做过伪国民大会的代表，季惺曾做过僧立法院的委员，当时尚以掩护报馆工作自相解释，经事实证明，这是当时认识不清，完全错误的幻想。对于那穷凶极恶的反动派，正如武松面对景阳岗上的老虎，所要作的，应该只是如何能打杀老虎，决不能去求它的“恩惠”而虚与委蛇。对于这种过失，我们内痛，我们惭愧。
    在中华人民共和国这个伟大的时代中，人人有从新做个新人的机会，这真是幸运。我们一切愿从头学起，从头做起。在今天我们两人共同感觉继续担负新民报的工作，责任十分重大。我们下定决心，站在新民主主义旗帜之下，绝对遵循人民政府的指导，绝对把握并坚持正确思想，把新民报办好。我们一定与本报全体同人一致努力，把新民报做成真正能为人民服务的报纸。这是我们今后唯一的志愿与努力的途径。
