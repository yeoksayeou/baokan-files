　　Rationalization Proposals
    An Introduction to the Production Management Experience of the Sino-Soviet Joint Venture Factories in Lüda
    Tian Lin
    Once the working enthusiasm of the masses is combined with scientific organizational leadership, it will radiate the brilliance of wisdom and genius. The "Rationalization Proposals" movement promoted in the Sino-Soviet joint venture factories in Lüshun-Dalian (Lüda) and the major factories under the Lüda Administrative Office's Industry Department is a model of this combination.
    At the Sino-Soviet Changchun Railway factory, thanks to the adoption of worker Bao Shubin's rationalization proposal, the triple valve (braking device for passenger and freight cars), which previously could not be manufactured without Japanese engineers, is now being pushed all over the workshops. Although the construction of the triple valve is so precise that even a hair's breadth difference between the air holes on the valve could cause the entire train to derail, it was finally successfully manufactured by worker Bao Shubin for the first time. At the glass factory of the Far East Electric Power Company, technician Xu Ruijiang's rationalization proposal freed the workers in the gas department from the fate of suffering from lung disease. During the Japanese occupation, the lives of Chinese people were worthless. When the gas department's coal furnace workers started the fire, they lacked safety equipment, and the gas would escape from another observation hole, harming their lungs. As a result, all the workers who worked in the gas department for five years suffered from lung disease. One worker who worked in the gas department for twelve years had completely ulcerated lungs. Now, none of the old workers in the gas department are not hunched over and gasping for breath. Xu Ruijiang's rationalization proposal simply added a steam pipe to the observation hole, preventing gas from escaping when workers started the fire. The health of the gas department workers was thus protected. How significant are rationalization proposals like this that relate to the health and lives of workers!
    There is no need to cite more examples; let us look at the overall achievements of rationalization proposals in the Lüda area. According to incomplete statistics from the Lüda Federation of Trade Unions, in the nine major units including the Far East Electric Power Company factories, the Changchun Railway factories, the Ship Canal Shipyard, the Jianxin Company factories, the Transportation Company, the Fishery Company, the factories under the Lüda Administrative Office's Industry Department, the Jin County salt fields, and the dockworkers' union, there have been 1,185 adopted and effective rationalization proposals over the past three years, including inventions, machine improvements, and raw material savings. These rationalization proposals have played a significant role in improving production efficiency and reducing costs. For example, the 147 rationalization proposals at the shipyard saved over 10 million Guandong currency in raw materials alone, equivalent to approximately 30 million Renminbi. The Sino-Soviet Changchun Railway factory reduced costs by over 100 million Renminbi in the first half of this year due to rationalization proposals.
    Rationalization proposals are not made by luck or inspiration. They are the result of workers using their brains, diligently studying, and combining experience with science. If you want to know how workers come up with rationalization proposals, listen to worker Yang Deming from the Sino-Soviet Changchun Railway factory describe how he started using coal to fire a diesel-fired muffle furnace that had been shut down!
    "I thought about it all day long, when I was eating, when I was in bed, but I couldn't figure it out. I got anxious. One day, after my coworkers had left work, I took a gas lamp and crawled into the furnace to take a look. I crawled back and forth several times before I got a sense of it. My method was to remove the bricks from the bottom of the furnace to make room for iron bars to let coal ash through, and then add a steam pipe to blow air into the furnace. In less than a day, the fire was lit, but it wasn't strong enough! Later, after everyone helped me think and modify it together, the muffle furnace became useful!"
    The enthusiasm of the working masses is precious. However, if there is only the enthusiasm of the workers without scientific organizational leadership to combine with it, then the enthusiasm will be wasted by blind creation.
    In most factories in Lüda, rationalization proposals are carried out under leadership, with planning, and with purpose. Each factory has a rationalization proposal committee. This committee is generally composed of the chief engineer, the factory director, technicians, and union personnel. The committee has divisions of labor for organization, publicity, and inspection. The committee works in two ways: one is to issue "topics," and the other is not to issue "topics." The latter is for workers to conduct research and make suggestions based on on-site needs. The former, such as the method used by the factories under the Far East Electric Power Company, is that on-site workers and technicians first propose the shortcomings in production regarding machinery, tools, and raw material use, and submit them to the rationalization proposal committee. The committee then compiles the current needs and possible improvement problems into rationalization "topics" and publishes them, and points out the possible directions and methods of improvement based on scientific principles. For example, one topic at the Sino-Soviet Changchun Railway factory was: "Using the method of changing the angle of the tool, increase the number of cylindrical materials turned by the lathe from one at a time to several." The purpose of issuing "topics" is to focus the workers' thinking on current urgent and possibly improvable problems, and at the same time point out possible directions for improvement, making it easier for the workers' creative enthusiasm to combine with scientific principles and avoid detours. As long as it is beneficial to production, rationalization proposals outside of the "topics" are also adopted. After the "topics" are announced, workers are given explanations and organized to study how to make suggestions. For example, one of the rationalization "topics" at the glass factory was: "Using the method of reducing the hardness of silica, increase the output of the silica pressing machine." For this "topic," some workers advocated crushing the silica first, some advocated grinding it first, and some advocated burning it first. After reviewing each one, the rationalization proposal committee adopted the method of burning it first, and the suggestion was considered established. The committee then calculated the value of the increased production that the adoption of this suggestion would bring in one year and gave the proposer a bonus of less than 15%. If the suggestion is approved and needs to be experimented with, the rationalization committee or the administrative side will provide the necessary assistance.
    Rationalization proposals use material rewards to encourage workers' creative activities. The proposer can not only receive a bonus calculated according to the value of the suggestion, but also, in factories that implement a piece-rate or progressive piece-rate wage system, wages can increase as output increases. This is one of the most effective ways to encourage workers to seek improvements in their lives from the development of production, and it is also the easiest way to mobilize workers' labor enthusiasm and give full play to their creativity. Since rationalization proposals mainly aim to improve production technology to achieve the goal of increasing the quantity and quality of products, it is more effective and more sustainable than general crash campaigns that increase labor intensity and labor time.
    Only by closely combining the labor creation enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers with a complete set of scientific organizational leadership for rationalization proposals can production efficiency be rapidly improved from the current level.
    Rationalization proposals are one of the main methods and characteristics of Soviet comrades managing factories, and they are also one of the best methods of relying on the working class to run factories well through the mass line. It is a vivid embodiment of democratic factory management.

　　合理化建议　
    旅大中苏合营工厂生产管理经验介绍
    田林
    工人群众的劳动创造热情，一经和科学的组织领导方法相结合，就会放射出智慧和天才的光辉。旅（顺）大（连）中苏合营工厂和旅大行署工业厅所属各大工厂中推行的“合理化建议”运动就正是这种结合的范例。
    在中长铁路工厂，由于采用了工人包树彬的合理化建议，从前离了日本工程师就不能制造的三动阀（客货车制动装置），现在在工场里到处都推满了。虽然三动阀的构造是那样精细，以至于阀上气眼与气眼之间仅差发丝一般的距离就有使整列车翻车的危险，然而终于第一次在工人包树彬手里制造成功了。在远东电业公司玻璃工厂，技师徐瑞江的合理化建议使煤气部工人从此摆脱了害肺病的命运。在日寇统治时期，中国人的生命是不值钱的，煤气部煤炉工人通火时，由于没有安全设备，煤气就从另一个看火的眼孔跑出来侵害他们的肺部。因此凡是在煤气部工作了五年的工人全都害了肺病，有一个工人在煤气部作了十二年工，他的肺叶就完全溃烂了。现在煤气部的老工人，没有一个不是背驼气喘的。徐瑞江的合理化建议，只是在看火孔上面加上一条蒸气管，使工人通火时煤气跑不出来。煤气部工人的健康就由此得到了保障。象这样关系到工人们的健康和寿命的合理化建议，该有如何重大的意义！
    例子不用多举，让我们来看看旅大地区合理化建议的总成绩吧。据旅大职工总会不完全的统计，在中苏合营的远东电业公司各厂、中长铁路各厂、船渠造船厂、建新公司各厂、交通公司、渔业公司和旅大行署工业厅所属各厂、金县各盐场、码头工会等九个大单位中，三年以来，工人合理化建议被采用收效的就有一千一百八十五件，其中包括发明创造、机器改进和原材料节省等建议。这些合理化建议对于提高生产效能，减低成本都起了巨大作用。如造船厂的合理化建议一百四十七件，只是节约原料一项，就节省了关东币一千万元以上，约合人民币三千万元。中长铁路工厂在今年上半年，因为合理化建议而降低的成本即合人民币一亿元以上。
    合理化建议不是凭侥幸，也不是凭灵感就提得出来的。它是工人开动脑筋，苦心钻研，使经验和科学结合的成果。如果你想知道工人是怎样提出合理化建议的，那么请听中长铁路工厂工人杨德明叙述他把停烧的柴油焖炉用煤炭烧起来的经过吧！
    “我成天在心里捉摸它，吃饭的时候捉摸，睡到床上还捉摸，可是，总摸不出一个头绪来。我急了，有一天工友们都下了工了，我拿上瓦斯灯钻到炉里面去看，就这么来回钻了好几次才摸着了边。我的办法是把炉底的砖拆掉腾出铁条漏煤灰，再加一条汽风管子往炉里送风。不到一天火果然点着了，可是火不旺！后来又经过大家伙儿帮着我一起捉摸修改，焖炉才好使唤了！”
    工人群众的热情是宝贵的。但是如果只有工人的热情而没有科学的组织领导工作与之相结合，则热情就会被盲目的创造所浪费。
    旅大大部分工厂的合理化建议都是在有领导有计划有目的的情况之下进行的。各厂都有合理化建议委员会的组织。这个委员会一般地是由总工程师、厂长、技术人员、工会人员等组成。委员会内又有组织、宣传、检查等分工。委员会工作的方法有两种：一种是出“课题”的，一种是不出“课题”的。后者即由工人根据现场需要进行研究建议。前者如远东电业公司所属各厂等所用的方法，先由各现场工人和技术人员把生产中关于机器、工具、原材料使用等方面的缺点提出来，汇交合理化建议委员会，由委员会把当前需要和可能改进的问题作成合理化“课题”公布，并根据科学原理指出可能改进的方向和方法。如中长铁路工厂的一条题目是：“利用改变刀子角度的方法，使车床旋圆筒料子时，由一次一个提高到几个。”出“课题”的目的在于集中工人的思考于当前急需而可能改进的问题，同时指出可能改进的方向，使工人的创造热情易于和科学原理相结合，少走弯路。只要对于生产有利，“课题”以外的合理化建议也同样地被采纳。“课题”公布后就给工人进行讲解，并组织工人研究如何进行建议。如玻璃工厂合理化“课题”中有一条是：“利用减低硅石硬度的办法，提高压硅石机器的产量”。对于这一条“课题”，有的工人主张先把硅石锤碎，有的主张先碾碎，有的主张先用火烧。合理化建议委员会在逐个审查之后，采纳了先用火烧的办法，于是这个建议就算成立。委员会随即计算这个建议采用后在一年中可能增产的价值，发给建议人百分之十五以下的奖金。如果建议被批准需要实验时，合理化委员会或行政方面即给予必要的帮助。
    合理化建议是以物质奖励来鼓励工人的创造活动的。建议人不仅可以得到根据建议价值大小计算的奖金，而且，在实行计件或超额累进奖薪工资制的工厂中，工资又可以随着产量的提高而增加。这是鼓励工人从发展生产中求得生活改善的最有效的方法之一，也最容易动员工人的劳动热忱和发挥其创造性的方法之一。由于合理化建议主要是以改进生产技术来达到提高产品的数量和质量的目的，因而它又比一般的增加劳动强度和劳动时间的突击竞赛等效果更大，而且能保持经常。
    只有这样使广大工人群众的劳动创造热情和合理化建议的一套完整的科学的组织领导紧密结合起来，才能迅速地把生产效能从现在的水平提高一步。
    合理化建议是苏联同志管理工厂的主要方法和特点之一，也是依靠工人阶级办好工厂的群众路线的最好方法之一。它是民主管理工厂的生动体现。
