Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 14th.—The Shenyang factories under the Northeast People's Government's Industrial Department Machinery Administration are achieving great success in a mass movement to create new production records while checking waste. A prominent feature of this movement is the leveraging of advanced workers' experience and innovative spirit to drive the entire workforce to improve overall production efficiency. Since the launch of this movement, the average production efficiency of the Machinery Administration's factories in August exceeded that of July by one-third, and in September, it exceeded August by another third. That is, within two months, it increased by more than 77%. Compared with the Manchukuo period, it has already doubled. Looking at the efficiency of manufacturing certain parts, some have increased by several times to more than ten times. For example, Zhao Guoyou, a young lathe worker at the Third Machinery Factory, created a new record in cutting pulley wheels (multiple wheels of different diameters on a shaft, shaped like a pagoda, used for hanging rotating belts to determine the speed of machine rotation) in two hours and thirty minutes, improving efficiency by more than five times compared to the original sixteen hours. Zhang Shangju, a marker in the factory's marking group, created a new record of eleven hours and thirty minutes for marking six-foot lathes, improving efficiency by fifteen times compared to the original one hundred and seventy-eight hours. Zhao Fuyou, a lathe operator with thirty-one years of experience at the First Machinery Factory, achieved a record of three hours and nine minutes for making a "lead screw," a six-foot lathe part. This reduced the usual time of twenty-three hours by more than six times and reduced the theoretical time of six and a half hours calculated by the engineer based on machine efficiency by more than onefold. Following this, on September 10th, Party member Gong Youan of the Third Machinery Factory created a new record of two hours and thirty-seven minutes for making a "lead screw," using thirty-two minutes less than Zhao Fuyou. Gao Dechao, a lathe operator at the Sixth Machinery Factory, originally planned to spend twelve hours making a bearing, but he made four in one day, averaging two hours each. In the past, seven workers at the Automobile General Factory produced only fifty catties of cylinder gaskets per month using manual methods; after worker Tian Zengfang and others researched and created a set of tools, the output increased tenfold. Many similar examples exist in various factories. In the first ten days of September alone, the First Machinery Factory saw the emergence of more than seventy workers creating new records. By September 10th, more than 150 people at the Third Machinery Factory had been rewarded.

    　　Rewarding Activists and Emphasizing Standardization
    Prior to July of this year, the factories mainly focused on repairing damaged machines left behind by the Japanese invaders and Kuomintang bandits. There was no foundation in various aspects, materials were scarce, equipment was incomplete, and production tasks were constantly changing, making it difficult to grasp the production process and creating some confusion. Factory managers were not only unfamiliar with the extremely complex machine production but also lacked experience in general organization and management. Their understanding of strengthening economic accounting was also vague. Therefore, they could not organize the workers' enthusiasm, resulting in significant waste. For example, the First Machinery Factory's foundry had an average scrap rate of 60% in the first half of the year. At the Fifth Machinery Factory, the labor wasted in the barbershop during daily working hours amounted to seven or eight people. In light of this, the Machinery Administration convened a meeting of factory leaders in late June to review and summarize past work, determining the future direction of "primarily serving industry, mining, and transportation," and significantly increasing the production of machines to enhance the production capacity of the Northeast's mechanical industry. However, due to the complete lack of preserved production record materials from the Manchukuo period, the leadership lacked a clear picture. Beyond the readily apparent waste, it was difficult to accurately determine the extent of other waste, where the waste occurred, where to save, how low production efficiency was, and how much it could be improved. After repeated research, it was decided that each factory should first implement daily work records to understand production conditions. The bureau appropriately adjusted machines based on the equipment of each mechanical factory, uniformly specifying record forms for various products, including machine cycle times, materials, types, cutting standards, and required time. These were circulated among the workers in preparation for launching a new record movement. At the beginning of August, when the wage practice group organized by the Northeast Trade Union Committee came to the bureau to study wages, the leadership decided to coordinate with this work. The Third Machinery Factory was the first pilot project, beginning labor time standardization work. Initially, activists were isolated and often faced exclusion and jealousy. At this time, the leadership provided material and moral rewards to activists on one hand, and on the other hand, convened technical worker symposiums to guide everyone to value standardization work. At the same time, they used various occasions to repeatedly explain that the standard time, materials, and labor quantity obtained from standardization would be used to calculate costs, and then implement piecework wages or bonus rewards, which would benefit both workers and the country. In this way, righteousness slowly rose, and unhealthy tendencies gradually declined. By August 25th, worker Party member Gong Youan made a "lead screw" in three hours and fifty-nine minutes, breaking the new record, and workers replaced jealousy with envy, wanting to catch up. As a result, the factory was filled with an atmosphere of mutual learning and exchange of experience. A large number of activists constantly emerged, and the movement to create new records unfolded enthusiastically.

    　From Factory Director to Workers, All Involved in the New Record Movement
    However, two deviations also emerged during this movement: one was that individual workers had the view of simply creating records for the sake of creating records, and when they focused their energy on creating a certain record, the efficiency of other regular work could not be improved. The second was that some workers, after creating new records, became complacent, believing that since a new record had been created, there was no need to find ways to continue improving. Therefore, the Machinery Administration promptly convened a meeting of factory directors and technicians to discuss continuing to enrich the content of this movement, preventing the above-mentioned deviations in a timely manner; and determined that the future direction would be to continue expanding and developing the movement to create new records, promote the work of bonus rewards, and require trade union work to closely cooperate, striving to initially establish the quality, quantity standards, and the required materials and labor quantity for each product in each factory by the end of October, in order to transition to planned production. The specific tasks are: (1) Expand and enrich the new record movement, making it move from point to surface, from factory director to workers, from technicians to management personnel all transformed into this movement. In terms of job type, it must develop from lathe workers to milling, planing, grinding, riveting, forging, casting, woodworking, electrical, handling, etc. In terms of time, it must expand from temporary record-breaking to regular new records every week and every month. In terms of scope, it must expand from the highest production record to new records such as rationalization proposal effectiveness, material conservation, careful planning, respect for teachers and love for apprentices, high quality with few rejects, and good production organization and leadership. (2) Organize specialized cadres to quickly standardize the products that have not yet been standardized, and conduct detailed reviews of those that have been standardized, initially establishing more comprehensive, detailed, and accurate specific production plans. At the same time, allocate tasks to each workshop, each machine, and each worker; and then ensure the implementation and realization of the plan through various organizational forces. (3) Establish a strict finished product inspection system to prevent the phenomenon of neglecting quality in the movement; and strictly implement a daily production report system so that the leadership can better grasp the specific situation of production and guide production. (4) Based on the situation of each factory and the current temporary quotas, implement partial bonus rewards for exceeding quotas, and gradually move towards comprehensive bonus rewards in combination with continued creation and experimentation.

　　东北机械管理局沈阳各厂
    展开群众性的创造运动  产量超过伪满时代一倍
    第三机械厂一百五十余人受奖
    确定“为工矿交通服务为主”的方针
    【新华社沈阳十四日电】东北人民政府工业部机械管理局所属沈阳各工厂，在检查浪费中开展群众性创造生产新纪录运动，已获得很大成绩。这一运动的明显特点是发挥先进工人的经验及创造精神，带动全体工人提高整个生产效能。机械管理局各工厂自开展这一运动后，八月份平均生产效率超过七月份三分之一，九月份又超过八月份的三分之一。即在两个月之内，提高了百分之七十七以上。若与伪满时期比较，则已提高一倍。如果从制造某些零件的效率来看，则有的提高了数倍至十余倍。如第三机械厂青年车床工人赵国有，以二小时三十分钟的时间，创造了切削塔轮（在一个轴上有数个直径不同的轮子，形如宝塔，挂转动皮带用，可决定机器转动的快慢）的新纪录，比原来做一个切削塔轮费工十六小时提高了五倍多。该厂划线组工人张尚举划六尺车床创造了十一小时三十分钟的新纪录，较原来的一百七十八小时，效率提高了十五倍。第一机械厂三十一年工龄的镟盘工赵富有，做一个六尺车床的零件“丝杠”，达到了三小时零九分钟的纪录。这较过去一般需二十三小时的时间，减少了六倍多；较工程师根据机器效能计算出来的理论时间六小时半，减少了一倍多。在这之后，第三机械厂工友党会安，在九月十日又创造了以二小时三十七分钟做一根“丝杠”的新纪录，较赵富有还少用三十二分钟。第六机械厂车床工人高得超，原计划十二小时做一个轴承，结果他一天做了四个，平均两小时一个。汽车总厂过去七个工人用手工制造汽缸垫，每月只生产五十斤；经工人田增芳与大家研究创造了一套工具后，结果产量增至十倍。诸如此类的例子在各工厂里还有很多，仅第一机械厂在九月上旬，三天内，即有七十余名创造新纪录的工人出现。第三机械厂在九月十日以前，已有一百五十余人受奖。
    　  奖励积极分子重视标定工作 　　　
    各厂在今年七月份以前，主要是修复日寇和国民党匪徒所破坏的残缺机器。各方面没有基础，材料困难，设备不全，生产任务又经常变化，故对其生产进程难以掌握，形成某些混乱状态。工厂的管理人员，对于这种极其复杂的机器生产，不仅外行，即对一般组织管理上，也缺乏经验；对于加强经济核算思想亦很模糊。因此，不能把工人的积极性组织起来，造成了很大浪费。如第一机械厂翻砂场，今年上半年平均有百分之六十的废品。第五机械厂每日工作时间内，在理发室里浪费的人工即有七、八个。机械管理局有鉴于此，遂于六月末召集了各厂负责人员的会议，检查和总结了过去的工作，确定今后“为工矿交通服务为主”的方针，大量生产机器，把东北机械工业生产能力提高一步。但是，由于过去伪满时期的各种生产纪录材料完全没有保留下来，领导机关心中无数，除表面上极易看出的浪费外，其他究竟还浪费多少，浪费在那里，要在那里节约，生产效能低多少，可能提高多少等问题，均难以准确地解决。以后经反复研究，才确定了各厂首先实行每日工作记录，借以了解生产情况。该局按照各机械工厂的设备情况，适当地将机器进行了调整，统一规定了包括机器周转数、材料、种类、切削标准、需要时间等项目的各种产品的记录表格，并在工人中进行酝酿，准备开展新纪录运动。至八月初，东北工薪委员会组织的工薪实习团至该局研究工薪时，领导机关即决定配合这一工作。首先在第三机械厂进行试点，开始了劳动时间的标定工作。当初积极分子很孤立，往往受人排斥和嫉妒。这时领导机关一方面以物质与精神奖励积极分子；另一方面召开技术工人座谈会，引导大家来重视标定工作。同时，又利用各种场合，反复说明标定所得出的标准时间、材料、人工数量，算出成本，而后实行计件工资或超额奖励，对于工人与国家都是有利的。这样正气就慢慢上升，歪风也就逐步下降。至八月二十五日，工友党会安以三小时五十九分做成一个“丝杠”，突破了新的纪录，工人们就以羡慕的心代替了嫉妒，都想迎头赶上。于是，工厂中充满了互相学习，交流经验的空气。大批的积极分子不断地涌现，创造新纪录运动也就热烈地展开。
    　从厂长到工人全部卷入新纪录运动
    可是，在这一运动中间，也曾产生了两种偏向：一是个别工友有了单纯为创造纪录而创造纪录的观点，当其集中精力创造某一纪录时，其他经常工作的效率，就不能提高。二是有些工人创造新纪录后，即表现自满，认为新纪录创造了，就不用再设法研究继续提高了。因此，机械管理局又及时召开了各厂长和技术人员的会议，讨论继续充实这一运动的内容，适时防止上述的偏向；并确定今后的方针为继续扩大开展创造新纪录运动，推动超额给奖的工作，并要求工会工作予以密切配合，争取于十月底前初步订出各工厂每种产品的质量、数量标准，及其所需要的材料和人工数量，以便转入计划生产。其具体工作是：（一）扩大与充实新纪录运动，使其由点到面，从厂长到工人，从技术人员到管理人员都转入这一运动中去。在工别上要由车床工而发展到铣、刨、磨、铆、锻造、翻砂、木工、电气、搬运等。在时间上要由一时突击的纪录，扩大到每周、每月的经常新纪录。在范围上要由生产上的最高纪录，扩展到合理化建议效能、节约原料、计划周密、尊师爱徒、质量高废品少、生产组织领导好等新纪录。（二）组织专门干部，把尚未标定的部分产品迅速标定出来，已标定的则进行详细审核，初步订出较周密、细致、准确的具体生产计划。同时，把任务分配到每个车间、每台机器、每个工人中去；然后通过各种组织力量保证计划的贯彻和实现。（三）建立严格的成品检查制度，防止在运动中忽视质量的现象；并严格实行生产日报制度，以便领导机关更好地掌握生产的具体情况，指导生产。（四）根据各厂情况和目前的临时定额，实行部分超额奖励，并结合继续创造试验，逐步走向全面的超额给奖。
