　　Important Material for Human Evolution Research
    Three Teeth Discovered at Zhoukoudian
    [This newspaper dispatch] This past September 29th, the Beijing Geological Survey discovered three teeth in the Zhoukoudian cave, where "Peking Man" (Sinanthropus pekinensis) was previously discovered. Preliminary identification suggests they may belong to "Peking Man." The Zhoukoudian excavation work by the Cenozoic Research Laboratory of the Institute began on September 27th, and this important discovery was made two days later. Furthermore, two large boxes of "Peking Man" specimens, originally belonging to China, were completely lost during the Anti-Japanese War. The Kuomintang reactionaries never had the courage to investigate their whereabouts in the United States or Japan. Therefore, this discovery may become one of the important materials in future human evolution research.

    周口店发现牙齿三枚
    【本报讯】北京地质调查所上月二十九日在周口店曾经发现过“北京人”（中国原人）的山洞里，发现了牙齿三枚，经初步鉴定，可能是属于“北京人”的。该所新生代研究室之周口店开掘工作，于上月二十七日开始，两日后即有此重要发现。又过去属于中国所有的“北京人”标本共两大箱，抗战时期，完全遗失，在美国抑在日本，国民党反动派一直没有胆量去查明。所以此次发现，在将来人类进化的研究工作上可能成为重要的材料之一。
