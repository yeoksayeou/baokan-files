Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 6th - After the Czechoslovak government decided to recognize the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and sever diplomatic relations with the criminal and bankrupt Guangzhou Kuomintang "government," Viliam Nový, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Czechoslovak National Assembly and member of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, met with a reporter from this agency and issued the following statement:

"The entire people of Czechoslovakia welcome with great joy and satisfaction the Czechoslovak government's recognition of the People's Republic of China and its severance of diplomatic relations with the criminal and bankrupt Guangzhou Kuomintang 'government.'

This is an expression of our people's understanding and solidarity with the fighting Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and its great leader Mao Zedong. Due to this action by the Czechoslovak government, the fact that we, the Czechoslovak people, and the great Chinese people have established very close contact within the great democratic and peaceful camp led by the Soviet Union is now formally recognized. The establishment of diplomatic relations between Czechoslovakia and People's China will be the foundation for the glorious development of economic, political, and cultural relations between the two peoples and countries."
