　　Beijing Soap Industry Improves Quality
　　Inspects Finished Products to Determine Grades
    [Beijing News] Under the leadership of the preparatory committee of the Beijing Private Soap Industry Association, the city's private soap industry is working hard to improve its business practices and product quality. In terms of business operations, in addition to the preparatory committee of the industry association preparing for joint sales, Dahua, Huaxing, Youxin, Lizhong, and Xinchang factories are conducting joint production and sales experiments. The five factories jointly contribute capital, and Huaxing and Lizhong factories produce new brands of soap, which are then jointly promoted in Beijing, the Northwest, and Tianjin. Regarding product quality, the first production run is 200 boxes, with the aim of achieving high quality. The main raw material oil blend consists of 70% tallow, 10% peanut oil, and 20% sesame oil; the ratio of oil to alkali is 56 jin of alkali per 100 jin of oil, and it is estimated that the pure soap content of the finished soap is at least 70%. After gaining experience from this, they plan to jointly purchase raw materials in Zhangjiakou and intend to concentrate machinery and technology to expand production. In order to improve quality, the preparatory committee of the industry association selected samples of 69 brands from 21 member groups and sent them to the Industrial Testing Institute for testing. The results showed that most had a pure soap content of 50% to 60%. The "Five Blessings Brand" produced by the Tianjin Soap Company and the "Golden Toad Brand" produced by the Jinchan Soap Factory had the best quality, with a pure soap content of around 80%; only one had a pure soap content of only about 20%. The preparatory committee of the industry association will announce the city's soap quality in three grades—A, B, and C—based on this test result, to encourage factories to improve product quality and to make it easier for consumers to choose.

　　京市造胰业提高品质
  　检验成品确定等级
    【北京讯】本市私营造胰业在该业同业公会筹委会领导下，正努力改善经营方式与提高产品质量。在经营上，除该业同业公会筹委会正筹办联合推销外，现大华、华星、又新、利中和信昌五厂则进行联合产销试验，五家联合出资金，由华星和利中两厂生产新牌子的肥皂，然后联合在本市、西北和天津推销。在产品质量上，第一次生产二百箱，品质力求精良，主要原料油的配合是牛油七成，花生油一成，麻油二成；油和碱的比例是一百斤油用五十六斤碱，估计肥皂成品的纯皂量至少是百分之七十。这次取得经验后，即计划联合到张家口购买原料，并拟集中机器和技术，扩大生产。为提高品质，该业同业公会筹委会从二十一个会员小组中选出六十九个牌号的样品，送工业试验所化验，结果，大多数含纯皂量在百分之五十至六十，天津造胰公司出的“五福牌”和金蟾造胰工厂的“金蟾牌”品质最好，含纯皂量在百分之八十上下；只有一家含纯皂量仅百分之二十左右。该业同业公会筹委会即将根据这个化验结果，把全市肥皂品质分甲、乙、丙三等公布，一面鼓励各厂提高产品质量，一面也使消费者易于选购。
