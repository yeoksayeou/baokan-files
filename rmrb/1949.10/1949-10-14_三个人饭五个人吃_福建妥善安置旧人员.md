Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 8th. The Fujian Provincial People's Government, the Fuzhou Military Control Commission, and the Municipal Government have separately resettled former personnel from various government organs. All those with a skill who are willing to serve the people are retained. Those who voluntarily return to their hometown to engage in production or seek other employment are seen off with a warm sendoff. Whether they are from this province or other provinces, the government provides travel expenses according to the distance and resolves transportation issues such as vehicles and ships. On the 26th of last month, the Provincial Government, Military Control Commission, and Municipal Government held a meeting to bid farewell to more than a thousand people returning to their hometowns. At the meeting, Shi Ying, Secretary-General of the Fujian Provincial Government, gave a speech, hoping that all personnel would actively participate in the construction of the new China after returning. He said: The People's Government's attitude towards former personnel is: all those who are willing to stay in Fujian to serve the people are welcome and will be retained or given opportunities to study. Even if there are current financial difficulties, we will definitely find a way. The food for three people will be divided and eaten by five, and houses will be crowded, but we will always ensure that everyone has a way to make a living. Those who voluntarily return to their hometown to engage in production or seek other employment will be given a warm send-off and provided with necessary assistance. The personnel returning to their hometowns were extremely grateful for the care of the People's Government and expressed their determination to work hard in production and work after returning to their hometowns.

    【新华社福州八日电】福建省人民政府、福州市军管会、市政府分别安置了各政府机关旧人员。凡有一技之长愿为人民服务的，一律留用。自愿回籍从事生产或另谋职业的欢送回籍，不论本省或外省，政府一律按路途远近发给路费并解决车、船问题。上月二十六日省政府、军管会、市政府开会欢送回乡人员一千多人。会上福建省政府秘书长石英讲话，希望各人员回去后积极参加新中国建设工作。他说：人民政府对旧人员的态度是：凡愿留在福建为人民服务者一律欢迎，予以留用或学习。即使目前财政困难，也一定想办法。三个人的饭五个人匀着吃，房子挤着住，总使大家生活有出路。对自愿返籍生产或另谋职业者，则予以欢送并予以必要的帮助。回籍人员对人民政府的照顾极为感激，纷纷表示回乡后决努力生产和工作。
