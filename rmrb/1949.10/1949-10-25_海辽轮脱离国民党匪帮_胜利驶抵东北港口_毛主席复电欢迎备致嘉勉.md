　　Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 24th: The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's ship "Hai Liao", displacing 3,000 tons, declared its breakaway from the Kuomintang bandit gang while en route from Hong Kong to Shantou and sailed towards a northeastern port. Upon arriving at the northeastern port, Captain Fang Linliu and all the 50-plus crew members were warmly welcomed by the local people.
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 24th: The entire crew of the "Hai Liao" ship, who broke away from the Kuomintang reactionary government to return to the fold, sent a telegram to Chairman Mao a few days ago to express their respect. The text of the telegram is as follows: Respected Chairman Mao:
    Our "Hai Liao" ship was originally a transportation tool for the people, but since the liberation of Shanghai, it has been used by the Kuomintang reactionary government for tasks that violate the interests of the people. All of us crew members were forced to work on the ship for the die-hards, and our hearts were extremely pained. We have longed for liberation for a long time. This time, while on duty between Hong Kong and Shantou, because we had sufficient fuel, water, and food for a long voyage, we resolutely declared our liberation at 9:00 a.m. on September 19th and set sail for our return. On the morning of September 28th, we arrived safely in the Northeast. The "Hai Liao" has now returned to the ownership of the people. From now on, under the wise leadership of the Chairman, we are willing to make our greatest efforts for the overall liberation cause and the people's shipping industry. We respectfully wish you good health.
    The entire crew of the "Hai Liao" ship.
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 24th: Chairman Mao replied by telegram to all the personnel of the uprising "Hai Liao" ship, stating:
    Captain Fang Linliu and all the crew members of the "Hai Liao" ship:
    Congratulations on your successful uprising at sea and sailing the "Hai Liao" ship to a northeastern port. For the benefit of the people's country, you united as one, overcame difficulties, broke away from the reactionaries and stood on the side of the people. This action is welcomed by the people of the whole country and should be emulated by all captains and crew members who are still under the control of the Kuomintang reactionaries and bureaucratic capital.
    Mao Zedong
