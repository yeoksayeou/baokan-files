Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 21st—Aishaiti Iskhakov, acting chairman of the Central Organizing Committee of the Xinjiang Peace and Democracy Protection League, Bao Erhan, chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government, and Ma Liangjun, the chief religious leader of the Hui people in Xinjiang, recently sent telegrams to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu to congratulate them on the founding of the People's Republic of China. Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu replied separately by telegram today. The incoming and outgoing telegrams are recorded as follows:

　　(1) Telegram from Aishaiti Iskhakov

　　To Chairman Mao of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China: I would like to extend my congratulations to you and all the representatives of the New Political Consultative Conference for the victory of the Chinese People's Liberation Army throughout the country, especially in the Northwest recently. Although the people of the Ili, Tacheng, and Ashan regions have laid the foundation for a new democratic life as a result of their armed struggle against the Kuomintang reactionaries, they are still constantly subjected to political oppression, economic sabotage, ethnic humiliation, and cultural destruction by the Kuomintang reactionaries. Thanks to the influence of the People's Liberation Army, the Kuomintang reactionaries in this province have been wiped out. When all of our people heard the news that the provincial government and the Kuomintang army of this province had submitted to the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army, they were all overjoyed and held unprecedentedly grand mass rallies. People marched in demonstrations, resolutely supporting and celebrating this historical event. In addition to expressing our greatest gratitude to you, the people of the three districts hereby state that under your leadership and with the help of the Chinese Communist Party, all the people of the province are willing to work for the establishment of a new life on the basis of equality for all ethnic groups with a solid economic base and a happy cultural progress. Aishaiti Iskhakov, Acting Chairman of the Central Organizing Committee of the Xinjiang Peace and Democracy Protection League, Ili, September 28.

　　(2) Chairman Mao's Reply Telegram

　　To Mr. Aishaiti Iskhakov and all comrades of the Xinjiang Peace and Democracy Protection League, and all compatriots in the Ili, Tacheng, and Ashan regions:

　　Thank you for your congratulations. The struggle of the people in the Ili, Tacheng, and Ashan regions is an important contribution to the liberation of the whole of Xinjiang and the liberation of the whole of China. I wish the people of the three regions and the people of the whole of Xinjiang unite as one, work together with the People's Liberation Army, and strive to build a new Xinjiang of people's democracy together.
