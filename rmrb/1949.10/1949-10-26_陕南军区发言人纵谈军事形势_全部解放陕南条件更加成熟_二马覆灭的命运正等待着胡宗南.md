Xinhua News Agency, Southern Shaanxi, 25th—The spokesperson of the People's Liberation Army Shaanxi South Military Region recently issued a statement on the military victories of the People's Liberation Army in Southern Shaanxi since the westward advance from late May to the end of September, as well as the current military situation. He called on the military and civilians throughout the region to continue their efforts to accelerate the liberation of all of Southern Shaanxi. The spokesperson first explained that the comparison of enemy and our forces on the southern Shaanxi front differs from the situation of fighting against the enemy on the main fronts across the country. The enemy in southern Shaanxi outnumbered our army and continued to increase. When our army began its westward advance along the Han River in late May, the opposing enemies were the 27th Army and the 98th Army. On May 24th, our army captured Baihe in one fell swoop, breaking through the enemy's first line of defense, which stretched 150 li north-south with Baihe City's West Tianchi Ridge as the key point, and then rapidly advanced westward. At the end of May, we liberated Zhuxi and broke the enemy's second line of defense, which stretched 180 li north-south with Ezi between Zhuxi and Pingli as the key point, entering Pingli County. The enemy, with weakened forces and intimidated by our army's momentum, rushed to reinforce with the 3rd Army and the 69th Army in early June. On July 10th, our army launched a strong attack on the enemy who had retreated to Pingli and its eastern regions and re-occupied the Ezi line, completely annihilating the enemy's main force, the 69th Army, and one regiment of the 98th Army, achieving significant results. Then, we advanced westward along the Han (Zhong) Bai (He) Highway, breaking through the enemy's third line of defense west of Pingli, which stretched over 100 li with the large and small Yaoshan and Nüwa Mountain as the key points, pushing the enemy back to the periphery of Ankang. In the fierce battle for Damei Niuti Ridge east of Ankang City, our army repelled eight enemy counterattacks, annihilating a large number of enemies and once entering Ankang County, achieving great victories. Under this situation, the enemy transferred the 111th Army of the Sichuan Army to reinforce defenses near Ankang. The spokesperson said excitedly: Our army, in its brave offensive, contained a total of five enemy armies, accounting for more than one-third of Hu bandit remnants, playing a significant role in coordinating with the Northwest main force to smoothly annihilate and strike Hu bandit forces. This is the glory of all the military and civilians in Southern Shaanxi.

The spokesperson then analyzed the characteristics of the enemy and our operations, saying: In the area of more than 400 li deep from Baihe to Ankang, high mountains stretch, with steep cliffs and forests. The enemy, with superior forces, relied on strategic terrain and solid fortifications to conduct a line-style key defense with vertical and horizontal branches, adopting feigned attacks and harassment to guard and counter our offensive, and also set up supervisory teams to force soldiers to fight us. However, since the enemy was completely in a defensive posture, on several long fronts, their forces were scattered and passive, and with the terrain limited, they could not support each other, and heavy weapons could not be used to their full advantage. This facilitated our army to choose their weaknesses and break them. In total, in the four months from the beginning of the westward advance to the end of September, we annihilated about 10,000 Hu bandit regular troops, captured more than 80 various cannons, more than 400 machine guns, and more than 2,000 rifles, expanded and armed the people's army, and liberated most of the Liangyun Sub-district, the Si Luo Sub-district, and part of the Ankang Sub-district, liberating more than one million people who had been brutally exploited and trampled upon by the Hu bandits, and greatly encouraged the anti-banditry work of the people throughout the region and in the inland.

　　陕南军区发言人纵谈军事形势　
    全部解放陕南条件更加成熟     
    二马覆灭的命运正等待着胡宗南
    【新华社陕南二十五日电】人民解放军陕南军区发言人顷就陕南人民解放军自五月下旬至九月底西进作战以来的军事胜利和目前军事形势发表谈话，号召全区军民继续努力，加速解放全陕南。发言人首先说明：陕南前线的敌我力量对比，与全国各主要战线的对敌作战情势不同，陕南的敌人在数量上比我军占了优势，并且续有增加。五月下旬，我军开始沿汉水西进时，当面敌人是二十七军和九十八军两个军。五月廿四日，我军一举攻克白河，突破敌以白河城西天池岭为重点的南北长一百五十里的第一道防线后，迅速西进。五月底解放竹溪，又打破了敌以竹溪、平利之间阂垩子为重点的南北长一百八十里的第二道防线，进入平利县城。敌以兵力削弱，慑于我军声势，乃于六月初赶调第三军及六十九军增援。七月十日，我军强攻回窜平利及其以东地区再据守阂垩子一线之敌，将敌主力六十九军及九十八军一个团全部击溃，获重大战果后，复沿汉（中）白（河）公路西进，十八日突破平利以西敌以大小药山和女娲山为重点的一百余里的第三道防线，将敌一直逼退到安康外围。在安康城东大嵋牛蹄岭的激烈争夺战中，我军打垮敌人八次反扑，大量歼敌，一度攻入安康县城，取得很大胜利。在这一形势下，敌又抽调川军第一百十一军到安康附近增防。发言人兴奋地说：我军在勇猛的攻势中共牵制了敌人五个军，占胡匪残兵三分之一以上，对西北主力顺利歼灭和打击胡匪，起了很大配合作用。这是我们陕南全体军民的光荣。
    发言人继分析了敌我作战的特点称：在白河到安康纵深四百多里的地区内，高山绵亘，陡壁丛林，敌以优势兵力，凭借险要地形及坚固工事，作支干纵横的线式重点防御，采取佯攻骚扰，以警戒和对付我之进攻，并组有督战队，强制士兵与我拼战。但由于敌人完全处于防御态势，在几条漫长的战线上，兵力分散被动，加以地形限制，不能互相策应，重火器不能尽量发挥作用，这就便利我军选择其弱点，予以击破。总计自开始西进至九月底的四个多月中，共歼胡匪正规军一万人左右，缴获各种炮八十余门，机枪四百余挺，步枪二千余支，扩大与武装了人民的军队，并解放了两郧分区、四雒分区大部及安康分区一部地区，使一百多万惨遭胡匪压榨蹂躏的人民获得解放，并大大地鼓舞了全区人民和内地军民的剿匪工作。
