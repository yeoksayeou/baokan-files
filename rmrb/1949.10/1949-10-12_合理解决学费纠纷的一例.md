An Example of Reasonably Resolving Tuition Disputes
City Government News Office

The tuition dispute at the privately run Beining Midwifery School in this city has been satisfactorily resolved through democratic appraisal with the assistance of the People's Government Education Bureau. Generally speaking, the tuition issue at private schools in this city is not particularly serious this semester. However, in a few schools, although temporary solutions were reached at the beginning of the semester, they were not thorough. If democratic appraisal was not conducted or if the democratic spirit was insufficient during the appraisal, excessive fees would be unaffordable for students, leading to incomplete payments. Conversely, if fees were set too low, the school would not have enough funds for expenses. Both of these deviations have now affected the progress of teaching. The reasonable resolution of the tuition dispute at Beining Midwifery School serves as an example for other private schools in the city to follow in continuing to address tuition issues.

This semester, the tuition and miscellaneous fees at Beining Midwifery School were initially decided hastily by the school, which convened only a small number of faculty and staff, and three representatives designated from the previous semester's student union of fifteen members, under the direction of the school: tuition and miscellaneous fees were set at two and a half bags of flour, and lodging fees at half a bag. They wrote these regulations and several free tuition conditions into a draft proposal. However, the entire student body was not informed of these regulations beforehand, and when the "draft proposal" was published, the school attached a mandatory measure stating "those who fail to pay on time will be expelled." This caused dissatisfaction among the majority of students. Some students questioned the school verbally or through big-character posters, and offered amendments; however, the school not only disregarded these opinions but also reprimanded students, tore down big-character posters, and attempted to expel four students who were dissatisfied with the decision under the pretext of "causing trouble."

After the dispute arose, the People's Government Education Bureau, based on the resolution of the All-Circles Representatives Conference that "private school tuition should be resolved through consultation between the school and students, and the Education Bureau should mediate in case of disputes," instructed the bureau's Supervision Office to understand the situation and assist in resolving it. After the director of the Supervision Office, Wang Xiu, and others exchanged opinions with both the school and the students, they emphasized that the occurrence of this dispute was mainly due to the failure to democratically consult on the tuition issue; and that after the problem arose, the school failed to promptly review its mistakes, leading to the expansion of the situation, causing chaos in the school, and affecting teaching progress; they also urged both the school and the students to comply with the Education Bureau's recent specific instructions regarding the democratic agreement to take care of both sides' spirits for a reasonable solution. At this time, the school invited the board of directors, convened faculty and staff, and student representatives elected from the first and second grades (third-grade students at the school received free tuition and did not need to send representatives) to re-negotiate according to the school's actual situation. First, they discussed the salaries that the faculty and staff should receive, the necessary equipment costs, repair costs, and other recurring expenses for the school in this semester; then, they re-discussed the number of free tuition slots and the application methods; finally, they published the draft agreement reached by all parties and solicited students' opinions for revision. Students in each class then conducted collective review and discussion. During the discussion process, Youth League members and activists played a leading role, overcoming the tendency of some students to demand excessive reductions in tuition and miscellaneous fees, as well as the indifferent attitude of other students. On September 14th, the school convened a general meeting of over two hundred faculty, staff, and students, with the participation of the chairman of the board and representatives from the Education Bureau in attendance. At the meeting, the school presented each item in the draft for discussion and voting by the general assembly. On several important issues, there were heated debates among all parties. Because faculty, staff, and students were able to promote the spirit of running the school well and learning skills, they finally modified the draft proposal and passed it as a formal agreement, in accordance with the principle of private schools charging fees to support the school.

According to the new regulations, various fees were appropriately reduced to two bags and six jin of flour for tuition and miscellaneous fees, and twelve and a half jin of flour for lodging fees. Later, the students, together with the school, quickly reviewed and announced the list of free tuition recipients, which was six names fewer than the stipulated one-tenth of the total enrollment, and ensured the prompt payment of fees. At the same time, the students made requests based on reality and smoothly passed the necessary recurring expenses. For example, to solve the difficulties in teaching, the 106 students in the first and second grades were divided into two groups, two more teachers were hired, and the teachers' teaching hours were reduced; it was decided to repair the school buildings, add classroom seats, wall charts, anatomical models, books, and newspapers, so that all the school's facilities could be gradually enriched from the current poor foundation.

In general, the burden on students at Beining Midwifery School has been reduced this semester, and the school's total revenue from fees is less than last semester, but according to the agreement, the school will be able to make far more achievements than last semester. Facts have proved that when agreeing on fees, students are not simply asking for a reduction in the amount, but are seeking reasonable expenditures, so that the school and students take care of each other to achieve a balance of economic income and expenditure, to avoid difficulties, and to add certain equipment and enhance learning conditions. Facts have also proved that only by adopting a democratic agreement can students fully exert their enthusiasm for protecting the school, plan everywhere to help the school run well, and solve many difficulties.

In order to promote the unity of teachers and students and the smooth operation of school affairs at Beining Midwifery School, the Education Bureau convened a general meeting of all teachers and students after the tuition issue was resolved. Principal Tian and Director Li both made self-criticisms at the meeting, reviewing that their past democratic style was insufficient, which led to the occurrence of disputes and affected students' studies. Student representatives and Youth League member representatives also spoke one after another. The Youth League member representative reviewed that he had failed to closely connect with the masses, did not appropriately put forward opinions, and carried emotions when dealing with problems. Finally, Wang Xiu, director of the Education Bureau's Supervision Office, spoke, explaining the importance of the tasks of midwives and the bright future of midwifery schools. He hoped that both the school and the students could carry out the spirit of today's review and unity in practical work, so that the new Beining School could develop and grow stronger. The meeting was filled with an atmosphere of unity and progress. After the meeting, teachers and students sang "Unity is Strength" together.

　　合理解决学费纠纷的一例
    市府新闻处
    本市私立北宁助产学校的学费纠纷，在人民政府教育局帮助之下，以民主评议方式，已获得圆满解决。这一学期，本市私立学校的学费问题一般地说并不算严重，但是有少数学校在开学时虽然暂时解决，却并不彻底。如未经民主评议、或评议中民主精神不够，订费过多则学生拿不起，缴不齐；订费过低则校方不够开支。这两种偏差发展到现在，全都影响了教学的进行。北宁助产学校学费纠纷的合理解决正是本市其他私立学校今后继续解决学费问题的一个榜样。
    这一学期北宁助产学校的学杂费，最初只是由校方召集了少数教职员及从上一学期旧学生会的十五个委员中指定了三人，在校方主持下匆促地决定的：学杂费面粉两袋半，宿费半袋。他们并把这样的规定以及几个免费条件写成一个草案。但是这样的规定全校同学事前并不知道，而“草案”在公布时又被校方附上了“凡不按期纳费者即除名”的强制办法，因之引起大多数同学的不满。有的同学便以口头或大字报的方式向校方质询，并提出修正意见；但校方对这些意见不唯不加考虑，反而斥责学生，撕毁大字报，并企图以“捣乱”的名义开除四个不满意其决定的同学。
    纠纷形成以后，人民政府教育局根据各界代表会议“私校学费由校方、学生协商解决，如有争议由教育局调处”的决议，责成该局视导室负责了解情况，协助解决。经视导室主任王修等与校方及学生双方交换意见后，便着重指出：这次纠纷的发生，主要是由于对学费问题的决定未经双方民主协商；而问题发生后校方又未能及时检讨错误，致使事态扩大，学校形成混乱，影响教学进行；同时并督促校方与学生双方遵从教育局日前具体指示的民主协议照顾双方的精神进行合理解决。这时，校方才邀请董事会，召集教职员及一、二年级推选出来的学生代表（该校三年级同学免费，无须派代表），重新按照该校实际情况进行协议。首先讨论了教职员应得的薪金，学校在本学期必需的设备费、修缮费以及其它各项经常费的开支；然后重新讨论了免费名额与申请办法；最后，将各方取得的协议草案公布，征求同学的修改意见。各班同学遂进行集体审查和讨论。讨论过程中，青年团员与积极分子发挥了领头作用，克服了某些同学要求过分降低学杂费的偏向以及另一部分同学不关心的态度。九月十四日，由校方召开教职员同学二百多人的全体大会，并有董事长参加及教育局代表列席，校方在会上将草案中的各项逐条提出，由大会讨论表决。在好几项重要问题上，各方曾有热烈争辩，由于教职员和学生都能发扬办好学校、学好本领的精神，终于按照私立学校收费养校的原则，将此草案再加以修改后，通过为正式协议。
    按照新的规定，各项费用很适当地减少为学杂费面粉两袋零六斤，宿费面粉十二斤半。后来同学协同校方迅速地审查公布了免费名单，比规定的十分之一名额还少六名，并保证了费用的迅速缴齐。同时，同学从实际出发提出要求，顺利地通过了必需的经常费用。如为解决教学上的困难，将一年二期一○六个学生分成两组，增聘教员二名，减少教员授课时数；确定修理校舍，增添课堂坐椅、挂图、人体模型、图书报纸等，使学校的一切设备从现有的贫乏基础上渐次充实起来。
    总的说来，北宁助产学校的同学这一学期的负担是减轻了，学校收费总额比上学期要少，但是按照协议，学校将可作出远远超过上一学期的成绩。事实证明，在协议费用的时候，学生并不是单纯要求减少数额，而是求得合理开支，在校方与同学彼此照顾下使经济收支相当，以免发生困难，并可增添一定的设备，增强学习条件。事实同样证明，只有采用民主协议的方式，才能使同学充分发挥爱护学校的积极性，处处为协助校方办好学校打算，使许多困难得以迎刃而解。
    教育局为了促进北宁助产学校师生的团结和校务的顺利进行，曾在学费问题解决后召开全校师生大会。田校长和李主任都在会上作了自我批评，检讨过去民主作风不够，致使纠纷发生，影响同学的学业。学生代表和青年团员代表也都相继发言，团员代表检讨了自己未能密切联系群众，没有适当地提出意见，处理问题时夹带意气。最后由教育局视导室王修主任发言，他说明了助产人员任务的重大和助产学校远大的发展前途，希望校方与同学都能本着今天检讨与团结的精神，在实际工作中贯彻下去，使新北宁学校发展壮大起来。会上充满团结与前进的气氛。会后，师生还在一起高唱“团结就是力量”。
