    【新华社汉口十九日电】武汉市人民政府工商局，为使武汉现有水陆交通运输工具的效率提高，以加强商运，正协助轮船、汽车等行业联合起来，组织规模较大的运输公司。轮船业已发起组织“内河航运联营公司”，经营货运等业务。公司组成后，即将在长江各埠和汉水等各河重要口岸设立码头和货栈，以利客货运输。木船业也正筹组公司，将有二百只大木船参加。工商局正设法消除该业存在的行帮主义和一些妨碍业务发展的陋规。汽车业公会亦已着手征求会员意见，筹建公司。
    【新华社汉口二十三日电】中原临时人民政府交通部，为增加航运力量，清除长江航道，保证航运安全，已指定华中航政管理局、汉口航业协进会、招商局汉口分局、汉阳船舶修造厂、打捞公司等单位组成华中区打捞沉没船舶委员会，着手打捞东自安庆、西至宜昌长江区内的沉没船舶工作。该委员会特为此发出公告，规定各公私营轮船公司，如有在上述区内沉没的船只，均限于十一月一日以前，携带有关证明文件，向打捞委员会申请打捞。逾期不申请者，打捞委员会得按其使用价值与是否障碍江道航行，分别予以打捞或炸除。
