　　[Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 11th] Electric News Agency Rome News: Vittorio, Secretary-General of the Italian General Confederation of Labor, made a report on the activities of the General Confederation of Labor at the Second Congress of the General Confederation of Labor held in Genoa a few days ago. He proposed that the current tasks of the General Confederation of Labor are: to prohibit employers from arbitrarily dismissing workers; to increase wages as much as possible in all industrial and agricultural sectors; to maintain and improve the automatic adjustment of wage standards; to implement a forty-hour work week; to increase unemployment benefits and pensions; to undeniably recognize the power of workers' factory committees; to grant legal recognition to joint management committees; and for workers to enjoy complete freedom to organize trade unions and the right to strike.

　　Vittorio then condemned the Gasperi government's shameful crimes of illegally imprisoning 10,000 Italian workers who exercised their right to strike. He also sharply criticized the government's proposed reactionary legislation restricting trade union rights, declaring: The trade union will conduct an uncompromising battle against this bill. "We must tell the government from this podium that its police methods will not frighten and subdue the Italian proletariat. Italian workers are currently patient, they want their legitimate rights to be respected and avoid the disaster of domestic conflict. But it must be known: patience is limited. Italian workers warn the government: abandon these methods, otherwise the Italian people will rise up and stop the club wielded by irresponsible hands."

　　Vittorio also criticized the government's propaganda that the Marshall Plan brought so-called "stability" to Italy, which is a stability of misery and unemployment. At the end of his report, he proposed a plan to develop public works to absorb two million unemployed workers.

　　意总工会第二届代表大会
    维多里奥报告当前任务
    斥责政府限制工会的反动立法
    【新华社北京十一日电】电通社罗马讯：意大利总工会总书记维多里奥日前在热那亚召开的总工会第二届代表大会上，作了关于总工会活动的报告，提出总工会当前的任务是：禁止资方随意解雇工人；一切工业与农业部门中尽最大可能增加工资；维护并改进自动调整工资标准；实行四十小时工作周；增加失业补助金及养老金；无可争辩地承认工人工厂委员会的权力；予联合管理委员会以法律上的承认；工人享有组织职工会的完全自由及罢工权。
    维多里奥继而斥责加斯贝利政府非法监禁行使罢工权利的一万意大利工人的无耻罪行。并尖锐抨击政府建议的限制工会权利的反动立法，宣称：职工会为反对该法案将进行不妥协的战斗。“我们必须从这一讲坛上告诉政府，它的警察办法不会使意大利无产阶级害怕和驯服。意大利工人目前是忍耐的，他们欲其合法权利得到尊重，避免国内冲突的灾祸。但是要知道：忍耐是有限度的。意大利工人警告政府：抛弃这些办法，否则意大利人民将起来并制止不负责任的手所乱舞的棒棍”。
    维氏并抨击政府所宣传的马歇尔计划给意大利带来所谓“稳定”，乃是悲惨和失业的稳定，他于报告结束时提出应以发展公共工程事业来吸收二百万失业工人的计划。
