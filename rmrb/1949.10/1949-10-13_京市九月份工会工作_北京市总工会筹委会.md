　　Beijing September Trade Union Work
　　—Preparatory Committee of Beijing Federation of Trade Unions
　　[Beijing News] The Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions recently released a briefing on its work in September, stating:

　　In September, the work of the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, in terms of state-owned factories and enterprises, focused on summarizing democratic management, organizational work, and employee education. The summary method adopted was, on the one hand, sending cadres to factories to investigate and assist, and on the other hand, holding symposiums with key factories to summarize experiences and lessons learned and determine the direction of future work through discussions and reviews. At the same time, a production and conservation campaign was launched in the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, Shijingshan Power Plant, and Beijing Automobile Repair Plant. Among them, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant launched a voluntary processing campaign through the trade union administration, rushing to make three large funnels (for sifting stones), and initiated a scrap iron collection campaign outside of working hours, achieving great results, collecting a total of 200 tons of scrap iron. This campaign was also launched in other factories. In addition, units such as the Qinghe Woolen Mill, Yanjing Paper Mill, and Telecommunications Bureau began to pilot "everyone running the trade union," and some have achieved preliminary results.

　　In terms of organizational work, municipal trade unions were established in the knitting industry, Beijing Palace Museum Library, match industry, cleaning team, ironworkers, and sewing industries. Preparatory committees for municipal trade unions were established in the cloth shops, department stores, barber shops, porterage, private hospitals, Western medicine, and oil barrel industries. Special handicraft industries such as bone ware, ivory, carving, and drawnwork embroidery (excluding toys, iron flowers, embroidery, and carpets) jointly formed a unified preparatory committee for the municipal trade union.

　　In implementing the policy of benefiting both labor and capital, collective labor contracts formally signed in September with the approval of the Labor Bureau included the night soil industry and the construction industry; the carpet, flour, and weaving and dyeing industries are awaiting review and approval; the shoe, match, iron, oil, salt, and grain industries are currently under negotiation.

　　In order to raise the political consciousness of the working class and welcome the Asian-Australian Trade Union Representatives Conference to be held in Beijing in November, the focus of propaganda and education work in September was placed on extensively carrying out internationalist propaganda and education among workers. The "Introduction to the Soviet Union," compiled by the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, has been printed in a total of 38,500 copies. The "Introduction to Major Countries in Asia and Australia" has now been printed in 30,000 copies and may be increased to 40,000 copies in the future. The "Introduction to Communist Parties Around the World" is currently being typeset. In addition, "The World's Two Major Camps" and "World Federation of Trade Unions" are also being compiled and reviewed. The above teaching materials are urgently needed by workers, but according to the feedback from workers' night schools and study classes in various factories and industries, the "Introduction to the Soviet Union" is considered to be too deep in content, with too many terms, and lacking materials covering the current social situation of the Soviet Union, and they requested that it be adapted into a popular and concise textbook. Efforts are currently being made in this direction. Regarding the solution to the problem of school enrollment for children of unemployed workers, 890 of the 910 applicants for middle school were admitted; 34 additional classes are planned to be added to primary schools, accommodating 1,700 people. In terms of guiding workers' cultural and artistic activities, a total of 61 cultural and artistic workers were organized to go to factories to help factories organize drama troupes, prepare for the establishment of clubs, and assist in the preparations for celebrating the founding of the Central People's Government. In addition, a music training class with more than 70 workers was held, with classes held every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday without affecting work. They have now learned the simplified musical notation reading method and eight songs such as "The Internationale" and "World Democratic Youth March." Preparations have also been made for welcoming the Asian-Australian Trade Union Representatives Conference and the Asian Women's Congress.

　　　　Preparing to Convene the Municipal Trade Union Congress

　　Preparatory work has also been done for the upcoming Municipal Trade Union Congress. The main contents of this meeting are: a summary report of the work over the past eight months and determination of future work tasks, adoption of the charter of the Federation of Trade Unions, and election of members of the Municipal Trade Union Committee accordingly to formally establish the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and discussion of the interim measures for the collection of membership fees and cultural and educational funds, as well as opinions on the handling of issues such as dismissal and wages in private enterprises. The number of representatives is set at around 500.

　　Generally speaking, the trade union work in September has overcome the chaotic phenomenon in leadership methods. In the past, due to the average allocation of cadres, the progress of the handicraft industry, porterage, and shop assistants in the four working committees was faster, while the work of the industrial trade unions progressed more slowly due to the large number of factories and the small number of cadres. Preparations are being made to transfer some cadres from the handicraft industry, shop assistants, and porterage committees to the industrial work.

　　京市九月份工会工作
    ——北京市总工会筹委会
    【北京讯】北京市总工会筹委会顷发表该会九月份工作简报称：
    北京市总工会筹委会九月份的工作，在公营工厂企业方面，系以总结民主管理，组织工作及职工教育等问题为重点。总结方式，采取了一方面派干部到厂调查协助，另一方面有重点的召集各厂座谈，以座谈检讨的方式，总结经验教训和确定今后工作方向。同时，在石景山钢铁厂、石景山发电厂、北京汽车修配厂等三厂中，开展了生产节约运动。其中，石景山钢铁厂由工会行政发动义务加工，赶制了三个大漏斗（筛石子用），并发起在工作时间以外的拣废铁运动，获得很大成绩，共拣废铁二百吨。这一运动，在其他工厂，亦有开展。此外，清河制呢厂、燕京造纸厂、电信局等单位，开始试行“大家办工会”，有的已获得初步成绩。
    在组织工作方面，各行业中成立市工会的，有针织业、北京故宫博物院图书馆、火柴、清洁队、铁工、缝纫等业。成立了市工会筹备会的有布店、百货店、理发、脚行、私营医院、西药、油篓等行业。特种手工业骨器、象牙、雕刻、挑补花等（玩具、铁花、刺绣、地毯除外）共同组成了统一的市工会筹备会。
    在执行劳资两利的政策上，九月份经劳动局批准正式签订的劳资集体合同，有粪业、建筑业；待审查批准的有地毯、面粉、织染等业；正在协商的，有鞋业、火柴、铁工、油、盐、粮等业。
    为了提高工人阶级的政治觉悟和迎接十一月在京召开的亚澳职工代表会议，九月份宣教工作的中心放在普遍开展工人中的国际主义宣传教育上。由市总工会筹委会编写的“苏联介绍”，先后共印三万八千五百份，“亚洲澳洲各主要国家介绍”现已印了三万份，将来可以增印至四万份，“世界各国共产党介绍”，正在排印中。此外，在编审中的尚有“世界两大阵营”及“世界工联”等。以上教材都是工人迫切需要的，但据各工厂各行业工人夜校、学习班等的反映，对“苏联介绍”认为内容深，名词多，包括苏联现在社会状况的材料少，要求改编为通俗简明的课本。现正往这方面努力中。关于解决工人失学子弟入学问题，报考中学的九百一十名，录取八百九十名；小学准备增设三十四个班，容纳一千七百人。在辅导工人文艺活动方面，共组织了六十一个文艺工作者下厂，帮助各厂组织剧团，筹设俱乐部并协助筹备了庆祝中央人民政府成立的工作。此外，并举办了一个七十余名工人参加的音乐训练班，在不影响工作的原则下，每周星期二、四、六上课。现已学会简谱读谱法和“国际歌”、“世界民主青年进行曲”等八个歌曲。另外，还准备了迎接亚澳职工代表会议和亚洲妇代大会。
    　　　　准备召开市工代会
    对于将要召开的全市职工代表大会，也作了准备工作。这次会议的主要内容为：八个月来工作总结报告及确定今后工作任务，通过总工会会章，并依此选举市工会委员，正式成立市总工会，同时讨论会费征收和文教经费的暂行办法，以及私营企业中关于解雇、工资等问题的处理意见等。代表名额定为五百名左右。
    总的说来，九月份的工会工作，在领导方法上，克服了混乱现象。过去曾因平均配备干部，使四个工作委员会中，手工业、搬运、店员等进度较快，产业工会工作由于工厂多、干部少，进度较慢，正在准备调动手工业、店员以及搬运三个委员会一部分干部到产业工作方面来。
