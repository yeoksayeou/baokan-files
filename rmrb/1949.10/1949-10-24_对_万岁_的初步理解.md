　　A Preliminary Understanding of "Long Live"
　　Yuan Jun

　　I wanted to understand what the two characters "Long Live" really meant. In the Ciyuan dictionary, I found that the words "Long Live" were originally a common term for "celebration." Han Feizi has the saying, "The sorcerer wishes people, 'May your lord live a thousand autumns and ten thousand years.'" Only after the Han Dynasty did it become exclusive to the emperor, and no one else could presumptuously claim "Long Live," nor could they shout "Long Live" to others. My first step was to understand that this term originally had no feudal meaning. However, like land, it originally belonged to the people, but was later plundered by the feudal class, forcing the people to acknowledge that it was their exclusive property. Now that everything belongs to the people, this term used for celebration also belongs to the people. In the past, a few people called the emperor "Long Live" were forced to kneel down and reluctantly shout it. Now, the people are liberated and freely and joyfully jump and shout "Long Live Chairman Mao" to express their heartfelt respect and love for their leader. Especially during this celebration of the success of the People's Political Consultative Conference and the establishment of the Central People's Government, I deeply experienced this point. In Fengzhen, outside the Great Wall, I saw an unprecedented celebratory parade. From seven- or eight-year-old elementary school students to seventy- or eighty-year-old elders, they were all joyfully shouting "Long Live Chairman Mao." The masses on the roadside also followed the parade and shouted slogans. Farmer Song Fuming, who went to the city to buy mats, heard that Chairman Mao had become the Chairman of the Central People's Government, so he carried the mats and squeezed into the parade, shouting slogans with everyone. Wu Fenglin, a sixty-year-old railway worker, sent off the train and didn't even eat, forgetting his leg pain, happily participating in the parade, supporting it to the end. The cries of "Long Live Chairman Mao" submerged all other sounds like a sudden storm. No one forced them to shout; it was entirely the call of the people's hearts. Moreover, the words "Long Live" are not limited to respect for the leader or the Communist Party. Did not Chairman Mao respond to the people's respect for him at the Beijing celebration, shouting, "Long Live the Comrades"? From this, I understand that "Long Live" does not contain any feudal meaning, but is the language of the people themselves!

　　对“万岁”的初步理解
    原钧
    我为了弄清楚“万岁”两个字究竟是什么意思。在辞源中我查出“万岁”两字本是“庆祝”通用之词，韩非子有“巫觋之祝人曰，使君千秋万岁”。汉以后才为皇帝所专有，任何人不得妄称“万岁”，也不能喊别人万岁。我便第一步理解到这一名词本无封建意味，不过也和土地一样，原为人民所有，后被封建阶级所掠夺，强迫人民承认是他专有的。现在一切归人民所有，这一庆祝所用的名词也为人民所有了。过去的少数人呼皇帝“万岁”，是被强迫的下跪低头勉强去呼喊，现在则是人民被解放，很自由愉快跳跃的在高呼毛主席万岁，以表示对自己领袖衷心的尊敬和热爱。尤其在这一次各地庆祝人民政协成功中央人民政府成立的时候，我更深切地体验到这一点。在塞外的丰镇，我看见空前的庆祝游行，从七八岁的小学生，到七八十岁的老人，都在愉快的高呼毛主席万岁，路旁的群众也跟着游行的队伍高呼。农民宋福明，进城买席子，听说毛主席当了中央人民政府的主席，便扛着席子挤进游行的行列中，跟着大家喊口号。六十岁铁路老工人吴凤麟，送走火车连饭都不吃，也忘记了腿疼，高兴的去参加游行，一直支持到最后。毛主席万岁的呼声如骤风暴雨一样淹没了一切声音，这没有谁强迫他们去喊，完全是人民内心的呼声。而且“万岁”两字，也并不限于对领袖或共产党等的尊敬，毛主席不是在北京的庆祝大会上还答复人民对他的敬意高呼着：“同志们万岁”吗？由此，我理解到“万岁”并不含有任何封建意味，而为人民自己的语言！
