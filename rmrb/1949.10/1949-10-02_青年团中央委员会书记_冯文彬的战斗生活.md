　　The combat life of Feng Wenbin, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League

　　The path of thirty-eight-year-old Feng Wenbin is as follows:

　　A child laborer in a match factory, an apprentice in a coal store, a nine-year-old child working ten hours a day, unable to see the sky or the sun, unable to attend school or play; the police near the factory, the small bosses in suits, the spirited managers and factory directors, he would spit and show disgust when he saw them, his young heart filled with rebellious anger, hating all the wealthy people who rode in cars and the police who carried guns – these financial powers and authorities who oppressed the workers. At the age of fourteen, he waited in the rain to hear the news of the May 30th Massacre, and from then on, he knew the workers' enemies also included imperialism. At the age of fifteen, he participated in revolutionary activities, and at the age of sixteen, he participated in the general strike of Shanghai workers to welcome the Great Revolution, holding a small red flag to welcome the National Revolutionary Army. The "April 12th" massacre showed him the bayonets of that "National Revolutionary Army" picking up the blood of his worker brothers, and class hatred made him recognize friends and enemies. In the days of white terror after the massacre, he disregarded the danger and joined the Chinese Communist Youth League and the Chinese Communist Party, thus beginning a life of combat, learning and growing in combat, always going to the most critical places of combat, standing at the forefront of the struggle: when the underground Youth League and Party organizations and the Red Trade Unions in Shanghai were suffering cruel devastation, he persisted in working among the workers, actively participating in marches, demonstrations, general strikes and other struggles. In 1929, he went to the East River and Western Fujian Soviet areas to join the Fourth Red Army and participated in the Long March to Yan'an. Since 1936, he has been engaged in youth work, and now serves as the Secretary of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League and represents the Youth League at the current People's Political Consultative Conference.

　　From a child laborer bullied by small bosses, factory directors, and managers to the leader of organized youth across the country, from only being able to write his name to being able to write specialized papers, from a worker intimidated by the police to becoming a representative of the People's Political Consultative Conference today, discussing the great plan of nation-building, Feng Wenbin's thirty-eight-year path is the path of the fighting Chinese worker-peasant youth. This is, as Feng Wenbin himself said: the result of the Communist Party's training and education. Recognizing the truth – resolutely making revolution, following the Communist Party, constantly striving to work, study, and fight, standing at the forefront of the battle, standing where work is most needed. Serving the working class, peasantry and the broad masses is also the path that every young person should take.

　　He said that before finding the Communist Party, he blindly resisted the factory director, and as a result, his father held his head down to apologize; he went to a civilian night school to study hard, and later became an apprentice in the coal industry, so his opportunity to study was also deprived. Feng Wenbin recalled heavily: "In those times, resistance was powerless, and there was no way out." Only by finding the Communist Party, bravely joining the ranks of the revolution, and working and struggling tirelessly, can one constantly progress and have unlimited future and hope!

　　Feng Wenbin also talked about when he joined the revolutionary work, his parents only had this one only son. They used tears and persuasion to desperately stop him, wanting him to consider the family line and not take such a "dangerous path." At that time, he had sworn to fight for the liberation of the working people for life, so he secretly left home. The revolution was victorious, and this year he returned to his hometown to see his mother, who was still alive and healthy, joyfully welcoming her son's return. The extremely happy mother told him in detail about the miserable situation of the workmates who had worked with him when he was a child over the past twenty years: some dragged their wives and children, prematurely aged, becoming little old men; some were forced to death by life; some had their whole families die. Looking at them, each one was not as good as the path taken by this revolutionary son.

　　Feng Wenbin's path is the right one, a good example for all Chinese youth. It is precisely because countless Chinese youths like him have disregarded sacrifice and feared no danger in the past thirty years, advancing wave upon wave, that the new and beautiful China has shown such glory today, and modern Chinese youth have such happiness to see their independent, peaceful, and democratic motherland appear, and a unified people's central government appear. Under the leadership of such a people's government and the strong Chinese Communist Party and the youth's own organization, the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, young people can freely strive to study and work for the motherland, turn their ideals into reality, and create a better life for themselves in the future. "In our time," Feng Wenbin sighed and said, "young people, to love the country, would be imprisoned, suffer hardships, and even be beheaded." "Therefore, we must cherish the fruits of our victory in this struggle." Feng Wenbin said firmly: "Young people were completely right to oppose the Kuomintang government in the past, because that was a corrupt, traitorous, anti-people, fascist dictatorship government. Moreover, the opposition to the Kuomintang government was for the purpose of establishing an independent and strong new China, establishing a people's own government. Today, the People's Republic of China has been born, and the Central People's Government has been established. This government is completely different from the Kuomintang reactionary government of the past. We young people should recognize this fundamental change: in the past, we were ruled and oppressed, but today we are already a part of the new country and the masters of the new society. Therefore, I hope that Chinese young people will actively support their own people's government, abide by all the laws and social order of the People's Government, abide by labor discipline in factories, participate in mutual aid in rural areas, and abide by learning order in schools. Youth League members should unite, promote, and organize the vast number of young people to recognize such changes and take the above-mentioned various positive actions."

　　Feng Wenbin finally smiled and said: "Our older generation of young people has done the work of paving the way for us and clearing obstacles. The Long March is only the beginning, and the magnificent and beautiful building has only laid the foundation stone. Now we young people must actively participate in various production and construction and national defense construction, and strive to study to transform the old society and build a new society. Young workers and peasants must work hard to develop production, young students and intellectuals must work hard to study and research, and in addition, they must actively participate in the people's air force, navy, and army, and actively respond to the various calls of the People's Government, and actively put forward suggestions for improvement and participate in this improvement for the various tasks of the People's Government. Young people must carry forward our excellent tradition of struggle and progress, and become a shock force in the construction upsurge that will be launched across the country. I will do my best to advance together with the vast and lovely Chinese youth." When he was so enthusiastically encouraging the youth and himself, the reporter saw in Comrade Feng Wenbin the enthusiasm he had when he joined the revolution at the age of fifteen, which is now even more resolute and powerful.

　　青年团中央委员会书记
   　冯文彬的战斗生活
    三十八岁的冯文彬的道路是这样走过来的：
    火柴厂的童工，煤炭店的学徒，九岁的孩子一天顶十小时的工，见不到青天，也见不到阳光，不能上学也不能游戏；工厂左近的警察，穿西装的小老板，神气十足的经理、厂长，他见了就轻视的吐唾沫、讨厌，小小的心里充满了反抗的怒火，那时痛恨着所有坐汽车的阔人和带枪的警察——这些压迫工人的钱势和权力。十四岁时，在大雨中等候着听五卅惨案的消息，从此知道了工人的敌人，还有帝国主义。十五岁时参加革命活动，十六岁时参加了上海工人迎接大革命的总同盟大罢工，拿着小红旗走去欢迎国民革命军。“四一二”大屠杀，看到那“国民革命军”的枪尖挑起了工人兄弟的鲜血，阶级的仇恨使他认清了敌友，在大屠杀以后的白色恐怖的日子里，不顾危险参加了中国共产主义青年团和中国共产党，从此开始了战斗的生活，并在战斗中学习着成长起来，总是到战斗最尖锐的地方去，站在斗争的前列：在上海地下青年团和党的组织和赤色工会遭受着残酷的摧残时，他坚持了工人工作，积极参加了游行、示威、大罢工等斗争，在一九二九年他到了东江和闽西苏区参加了红四军，参加长征到了延安。一九三六年起从事青年工作，现在担任中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会书记，并代表青年团出席这次召开的人民政协。
    从一个受着小老板、厂长和经理欺负的童工到全国有组织的青年的领导者，从仅能写自己的名字到能写专门性的论文，从一个被警察威吓着的工人，到今天成为参加商讨建国大计的人民政协的代表，冯文彬这卅八年的道路是战斗的中国工农青年的道路。这就是如冯文彬自己所说的：这是共产党的培养和教育的结果。认识真理——坚决革命，跟着共产党走，不断地努力工作，学习和战斗，站到战斗的最前线去，站到工作最需要的地方去。为工农大众服务，这也是每个青年应走的道路。
    他说到在没有找到共产党以前，他盲目反抗过厂长，结果被他的父亲按着头去赔罪；他进平民夜校努力读书，后来又进煤炭业做学徒，因此他的学习的机会也被剥夺；冯文彬沉重地回忆着说：“在那些时候，反抗是无力的，出路是没有的”，只有找到了共产党，勇敢地参加了革命的行列，不懈怠的工作和斗争，才能不断地进步，才有无限前途和希望！
    冯文彬又谈到在他参加革命工作时，他的父母只有这一个独养子，他们用眼泪和劝说来苦苦拦阻他，要他顾念家中的一线香烟，不要走这样一条“危险的路”。那时他已宣誓终身为劳动人民的解放而奋斗，因此偷偷地出了家门。革命胜利了，今年他回到家乡去看看，他母亲还健朗地活着，欢笑地迎接儿子的归来，欢喜极了的母亲絮絮告诉他小时同他在一起做工的工友们这二十年来被压榨的惨况：有些是拖妻带儿，未老先衰，成了个小老头儿，有的被生活逼死了，有的全家都死完了，看起来一个个都不如这革命的儿子走的路对。
    冯文彬的道路是走对了，是一切中国青年的好榜样。正由于无数的象他那样的中国青年在以往的卅年来，不顾牺牲，不怕危险，前仆后继，新的美丽的中国才显出今天这样的光辉，现代的中国青年也才有这样的幸福看到自己的独立、和平、民主的祖国出现，统一的人民的中央政府出现。在这样的人民政府和强大的中国共产党和青年自己的组织中国新民主主义青年团的领导下，青年们可以自由地为祖国努力学习和工作，把自己的理想变成现实，为自己创立未来更美好的生活。“在我们那时”，冯文彬感叹着说：“青年们，要爱国，也会坐牢受苦甚至杀头呢”。“因此我们要珍惜我们这斗争的胜利的果实。”冯文彬坚决地说：“青年们在过去反对国民党政府，是完全对的，因为那是腐败的卖国的反人民的法西斯独裁的政府。而且反对国民党政府为的是建立一个独立富强的新中国，建立人民自己的政府，今天中华人民共和国已经诞生，中央人民政府已经成立，这个政府和过去的国民党反动政府是完全不同的。我们青年应该认识到这个根本的变化：过去我们是被统治压迫的，今天已经是新国家新社会的主人的一分子，因此，我希望中国的青年，要积极拥护人民自己的政府，要遵守人民政府所有的法令和社会秩序，在工厂内要遵守劳动纪律，在农村内要参加变工互助，在学校内要遵守学习秩序。青年团员则要团结推动和组织广大青年来认识这样的变化并采取上述的各种积极行动。”
    冯文彬最后笑着说：“我们的先一辈的青年已为我们做了开路的工作，做了扫清障碍的工作。万里长征还只是开始，庄严美丽的大厦还只是奠立了基石，现在我们青年们要积极参加各种生产建设和国防建设，努力学习来改造旧社会，建立新社会。青年工人和农民要努力发展生产，青年学生和知识分子要努力学习和研究，此外并要积极参加人民的空军、海军、陆军和积极响应人民政府的各项号召，积极地对于人民政府的各项工作提出改进的意见并参加这种改进。青年们要发扬我们优良的奋斗前进的传统，要成为将要在全国展开的建设热潮的一支突击力量。我要竭尽自己的力量，和广大的可爱的中国青年一起前进”。在他这样热情地激励着青年和自己的时候，记者在冯文彬同志身上看到了他在十五岁时参加革命的热情，如今是更其沉毅，更其有力了。
