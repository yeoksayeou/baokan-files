　　革大 Second Phase Holds First League Admission Ceremony
    Nearly Four Hundred New League Members Take Oath
    Hu Xikui, Gao Tang, and Others Attend and Speak
    [Our Newspaper] The oath-taking ceremony for the first group of three hundred and eighty-four Communist Youth League members of the second phase of the North China People's Revolutionary University was solemnly held at 2:00 PM on the 28th in the school's East Square. Representatives from the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League and over three thousand students and staff members attended. At the meeting, Vice President of the school, Hu Xikui, representative of the school Party Committee, Hou Weiyu, representative of the Central Committee of the League, Gao Tang, Deputy Secretary of the school League Committee, Zhou Ming, student representatives, League members, and non-League members, ten people in total, gave speeches, and all the new League members of the three departments presented a flag. In his speech, Hu Xikui instructed League members and non-League members to help each other, learn from each other, and work together to complete their learning tasks. Hou Weiyu requested League members to become the core and model for uniting classmates and transforming their thinking in their studies, and to prevent arrogance and a style of work that is divorced from the masses. Gao Tang pointed out: "Joining the League does not mean that we have no shortcomings, it only confirms a correct direction; and there are still many remnants of the old society in our thinking, which must be overcome with greater effort." Zhou Ming hoped that everyone would take the oath as the direction of their actions and use it to examine themselves at all times. In the speeches of the student representatives, League members, and non-League members, they all expressed their infinite love and respect for the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League, and guaranteed that under the leadership of the Party, they would study hard, transform themselves, and strive to build a new China, shouting the slogan "Always follow the Communist Party." The meeting concluded at 5:00 PM with the song "Young people, hot hearts, follow Mao Zedong forward!"
