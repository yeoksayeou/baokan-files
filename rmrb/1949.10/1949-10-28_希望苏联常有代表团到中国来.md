Hoping for Frequent Soviet Delegations to China
    Zhū Kězhēn

　　Since the arrival of the Soviet cultural, artistic, and scientific workers' delegation in the capital, I personally have attended two discussion seminars and five or six lectures, from which I have benefited greatly. I especially admire their spirit of tireless teaching. Even after lecturing for two or three hours, they always answered any questions raised, truly living up to their role as our good teachers and helpful friends. Although there is a language barrier between China and the Soviet Union, the fact that delegation leader Fadeyev can so appreciate Chinese literature is something we should be proud of and celebrate. Whether in the arts or sciences, there is much we need to learn from the Soviet Union. I hope that similar Soviet delegations will come to China frequently in the future, and at the same time, our artists and scientists can also visit the Soviet Union in a constant stream, creating a great exchange of culture between China and the Soviet Union.

　　希望苏联常有代表团到中国来
    竺可桢
    这次苏联文化艺术科学工作者代表团到首都以后，我个人曾经参加过两次讨论座谈会、五六次演讲。获益不浅。尤其佩服他们诲人不倦的精神。虽讲演了两三小时以后，凡是有人提出疑难，总是有问必答，不愧为我们的良师益友。中苏之间虽有文字上的隔阂，而团长法捷耶夫之能如此欣赏中国文学，是值得我们自豪而赞美的一桩事。无论在文艺方面或是科学方面，我们要向苏联学习的地方甚多，希望以后苏联常有类似的代表团来中国，同时我们的文艺家科学家也能川流不息的去苏联观光。酿成中苏两国文化的大交流。
