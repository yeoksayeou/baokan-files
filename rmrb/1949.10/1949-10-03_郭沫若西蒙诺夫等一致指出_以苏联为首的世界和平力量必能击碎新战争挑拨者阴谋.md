Guo Moruo, Simonov, and Others Unanimously Point Out That the World Peace Force Headed by the Soviet Union Will Surely Shatter the Conspiracies of the Instigators of New Wars
	Guo Moruo then delivered a report to the conference as Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the China World Peace Congress.
	He said: In China, the people's revolutionary war has been victorious, and the Central People's Government, which the people of the whole country have been eagerly hoping for, has been established. This is a great victory for the world peace camp. He said: "In order to further strike at the imperialist aggressors and consolidate the peace and democracy camp, the Chinese people will continue to work hard to eliminate the remaining forces of the domestic reactionaries, and at the same time use their main strength to restore and develop the people's economy and culture. At the same time, we will establish the Chinese Committee for the Defense of World Peace at this conference, so as to more systematically and step-by-step strengthen the Chinese people's work for lasting world peace, and establish closer ties with the peace and democracy movements of all countries."

	Simonov After Guo Moruo's report, Simonov, the deputy head of the Soviet delegation, took the stage to deliver a speech amidst enthusiastic applause from the audience. In his speech, he pointed out the great contribution of the Chinese people's victory to world peace, and pointed out that the Soviet Union has been leading the peace front for more than 30 years and has been fighting for world peace. He said: Let everyone know that today the cause of peace is strengthened. We – the advocates of world peace – our strength has never been so great. The conference held here today is a great proof.

	Shen Yanbing Then, Shen Yanbing, vice chairman of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, delivered a speech. He said: "The Chinese people know from their own experience that the aggression of imperialism and its running dogs can be defeated and will inevitably be defeated; as long as the people who love democracy and peace unite and unite around the Soviet Union, the strong fortress of democracy and peace in the world, then the war conspiracies of the imperialist aggressive group to attack the Soviet Union, attack new China and other new democratic countries will surely be stopped, and if they dare to launch a war, they will surely eat their own fruit." He said: "We Chinese literary and art workers, under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong, will do our best to fight against imperialist aggressive wars and strive for lasting world peace through various forms of literature and art."
	Fan Xiaofeng In her speech, Fan Xiaofeng, a representative of Chinese young female workers, said: "I have seen the Soviet film 'Bright Road', which made me yearn for the Soviet Union and hope to live a happy and joyful life like the workers in the Soviet Union. Now the Chinese workers and the Chinese people have stood up together, and today my wish can be fully realized. We must learn from the Soviet Union and build our own country for workers with the help of international friends."
	Wu Yaozong Wu Yaozong, a representative of the religious circles, said: "The birth of new China is an important pillar of world peace. It will enable the world's peace forces headed by the Soviet Union to gain a strong new force. Imperialism is already stretched thin, outwardly strong but inwardly weak, and the birth of new China has made them even more confused and distressed, and they have reached the end of their road. We can guarantee that we have sufficient strength to defeat them."
	Liang Xi Liang Xi, representative of the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Association of Natural Science Workers, said: "Now the war speculators can wake up. The great unity of the Chinese people has established an independent, democratic, peaceful, and unified People's Republic of China. Except for the reactionaries, none of the 475 million people need war."
	Li Dequan Li Dequan, vice chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, said: "We Chinese women have always loved peace, but we know that peace needs to be won through struggle. Therefore, we will never show weakness in front of enemies at home and abroad. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we bravely participated in military work, supported the front line, and worked hard in agricultural and industrial production during the people's great revolution. We resolutely opposed imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. This heroic struggle has been successful domestically."
	Today's meeting was filled with an atmosphere of excitement, joy, and international friendship and unity from beginning to end. During the speeches, the audience stood up and applauded for a long time for the great names of Marshal Stalin and Chairman Mao Zedong countless times. At the same time, the orchestra played the national anthems of China and the Soviet Union, as well as songs such as "March of the Motherland" and "The East is Red." After Guo Moruo's report, youth representatives from Beijing presented flowers to the Soviet delegation and the Italian people's representatives to pay their respects.
	The meeting adjourned after Li Dequan's speech and will continue tomorrow afternoon.
	This afternoon, a part of the Soviet delegation and the Korean delegation went to Tianjin to participate in the mass rally in Tianjin to celebrate the founding of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and the International Day for the Struggle for Peace.

　　郭沫若西蒙诺夫等一致指出以
    苏联为首的世界和平力量必能击碎新战争挑拨者阴谋
    郭沫若继由中国保卫世界和平大会筹委会主任郭沫若向大会作报告。
    他说：在中国，人民革命战争已经胜利，全国人民所热望的中央人民政府已经成立，这是世界和平阵营的大胜利。他说：“中国人民为了进一步打击帝国主义侵略者，巩固和平民主阵营，将继续努力肃清国内反动派的残余力量，并用主要力量恢复与发展人民的经济与文化同时我们将在这个大会上成立中国保卫世界和平的委员会，以便更有计划有步骤地加强中国人民争取世界持久和平的工作，并与各国人民的和平民主运动建立更密切的联系。”
    （报告全文见另电）
    西蒙诺夫　郭沫若报告毕，苏联代表团副团长西蒙诺夫在全场起立热烈鼓掌中登台发表演说，他在演说中指出中国人民的胜利对世界和平的伟大贡献，指出苏联三十余年来一直在领导和平阵线，一直在为世界和平而奋斗。他说：让每一个人都知道，今天和平事业是加强了。我们——世界和平的拥护者——的力量，是从来没有这样强大过的。今天在此地举行大会，就是一个伟大的证明。（演说词全文见另电）
    沈雁冰　继由中华全国文学艺术界联合会副主席沈雁冰讲演，他说：“中国人民由于自己的经验，知道帝国主义及其走狗的侵略是可以战胜的，而且必然能够战胜的；只要爱好民主与和平的人民团结一致，而且要团结在全世界民主与和平的坚强堡垒苏联的周围，那末，帝国主义侵略集团的进攻苏联，进攻新中国及其他新民主主义国家的战争阴谋，一定可以制止，而且，如果他们敢于发动战争，也一定要自食其果的。”他说：“我们中国的文艺工作者在伟大领袖毛泽东主席教导之下，一定竭尽全力，通过各种文艺形式，为反对帝国主义侵略战争，争取世界的持久和平而奋斗。”
    范小凤　中国青年女工代表范小凤在讲话中说：“我看过苏联电影‘光明之路’，就使我向往苏联，希望能和苏联的工人那样过着幸福愉快的生活。现在中国工人和中国人民一起站立起来了，今天完全可以实现我的愿望了，我们要向苏联学习，在国际友人的帮助之下，建设我们工人自己的国家”。
    吴耀宗　宗教界代表吴耀宗说：“新中国的诞生，是世界和平一个重要的支柱。它将使以苏联为首的全世界的和平力量，得到一个强大的生力军。帝国主义已经是捉襟见肘，外强中干，新中国的诞生更使他们徨傍苦闷，到了末路穷途的地步。我们可以保证，我们是有充分的力量，可以把他们打倒。”
    梁希　中华全国自然科学工作者协会筹备会代表梁希说：“现在战争投机者可以清醒了，中国人民大团结，已经成立了独立、民主、和平、统一的中华人民共和国。四万万七千五百万人民除了反动派外，谁也不需要战争”。
    李德全　中华全国妇女联合会副主席李德全说：“我们中国妇女，一向爱好和平的，但是我们知道和平需要从斗争中得来。因此我们在国内外敌人面前，绝不表示软弱。我们在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，在人民大革命中，勇敢地参加了军队工作，支援了前线，努力从事农业工业的生产。我们坚决反对了帝国主义封建主义和官僚资本主义。这种英勇的斗争，在国内已经成功了。”
    今日会议自始至终洋溢着兴奋、愉快和国际友谊团结的气氛。在讲演中，全场无数次地为斯大林大元帅、毛泽东主席的伟大的名字而全场起立作持久的欢呼鼓掌。同时乐队奏起中、苏两国国歌和祖国进行曲、东方红等歌曲。在郭沫若报告后，北京市青年代表并向大会苏联代表团和意大利人民代表献花致敬。
    会议在李德全讲话后宣告休会，明日下午继续举行。
    今日下午苏联代表团的一部分代表和朝鲜代表团均赴天津参加天津市庆祝中华人民共和国中央人民政府成立和国际和平斗争日示威的群众大会。
