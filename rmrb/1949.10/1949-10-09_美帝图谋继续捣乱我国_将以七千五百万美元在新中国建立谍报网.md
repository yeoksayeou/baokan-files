　　U.S. Imperialism Plots to Continue Sabotaging Our Country
    Will Use $75 Million to Establish a Spy Network in New China
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 8th. The purpose of the $75 million granted to the Kuomintang remnants in the aggressive "Mutual Defense Assistance Act" recently passed by the U.S. Congress has been more clearly revealed by the Washington Post, which is close to the State Department. According to a United Press Washington dispatch on the 2nd: "The Post editorial suggests that Truman use the $75 million stipulated by the Congressional Defense Assistance Act for general areas in China to help Americans establish a spy network in 'Communist China and Communist-controlled areas'." In this way, the true purpose of this dirty money, which Truman and the U.S. Congress did not dare to openly propose (according to the Congressional bill, this money can be freely used by Truman "without specifying the nature of its use"), has been openly revealed by the Post. The Post's proposal demonstrates the imperialists' heinous intention to continue sabotaging the People's Republic of China to the very end.

　　美帝图谋继续捣乱我国
    将以七千五百万美元在新中国建立谍报网
    【新华社北京八日电】美国国会最近所通过的侵略性“防务互助法案”中授予国民党残匪的七千五百万美元的用途，已由与国务院接近的华盛顿邮报更明白地透露。据合众社华盛顿二日讯：“邮报社论建议杜鲁门将国会防务互助法案规定用于中国一般地区的七千五百万美元用来帮助美国人在‘共产党中国及共产党控制区’建立谍报网。”这样，杜鲁门和美国会所不敢明目张胆地提出的这笔肮脏款项的真实用途（按国会法案中规定此款可由杜鲁门自由动用，“不必列明用途性质”），已由邮报公然道破。邮报提出这种建议，说明了帝国主义者继续捣乱中华人民共和国到底的罪恶意图。
