　　Planting the New China's National Flag on Xiamen Island
    Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 22nd. The day before the Xiamen Campaign was launched—on October 14th, at the swearing-in ceremony of a certain assault battalion of the People's Liberation Army on the Fujian front, instructor Jiang Yongchang held a bright and magnificent five-star red flag of the New China in both hands. He presented it to the main assault company—the "July 1st Meritorious Company" commander, Gao Jiubao, in front of the entire battalion of assault heroes.

    Amidst applause, Instructor Jiang solemnly said: "Now I present this solemn and great national flag of New China to the comrades of the 'July 1st Meritorious Company,' who have performed meritorious service for the people. We require you to complete this task and plant the national flag of New China on Xiamen Island, at the summit of Shenshan where we make our breakthrough! As a gift to celebrate the founding of New China!"

    As Company Commander Gao solemnly accepted the national flag, a burst of enthusiastic cheers immediately erupted from the ranks: "Resolutely plant the national flag on Xiamen Island!"

    After the national flag reached the "July 1st Meritorious Company," it caused a sensation in every squad and platoon. All the assault team members requested to undertake this glorious mission. Finally, the national flag was handed over to the third squad, and the comrades of the third squad jumped up with excitement. The soldiers said to First Platoon Leader Zhang Yutian: "Platoon Leader, look, the national flag will definitely be planted." Squad Leader Xu Jihe, a warrior who was always as lively and vigorous as a dragon and tiger on the battlefield, patted his chest and said: "Even if a man falls, the national flag must not fall. How can we not complete such a glorious mission!"

    On the night of the 15th, the assault team's boats sailed towards Xiamen Island like arrows. The soldiers of the third squad of the "July 1st Meritorious Company" rowed their boats forward with extra effort, but the boat ran aground on the beach not far from the enemy's position. The enemy's machine guns fired frantically. The assault team's heroes, braving the artillery fire, quickly jumped out of the boat and rushed forward, crawling and rolling in the mud. Soldier Zhang Cunguo, who was carrying the national flag on his back, rushed even faster. He and all the soldiers of his squad were inspired by a great belief: rush to the front and plant the national flag on the summit of Shenshan! While shouting and advancing, he also paid close attention not to let the national flag get stained with mud. When he rushed to about twenty meters from the land, four enemy machine gun bullets hit him in the chest, and he fell. But Zhu Hongsheng from the same squad quickly took the national flag from him and rushed forward.

    A fierce close-quarters battle unfolded at the foot of Shenshan. The assaulting heroes fought bravely and heroically, chasing and killing the remnants of the bandits, and pouncing on the summit of Shenshan like tigers. Before dawn, the heroes completely occupied the summit of Shenshan. In the faint light of dawn, the bright and magnificent five-star red flag fluttered in the wind on Xiamen Island.

　　把新中国国旗
  　插上厦门岛
    厦门战役发起的前一天——十月十四日，在福建前线人民解放军某部突击营的誓师大会上，教导员蒋永昌双手拿着一面鲜艳壮丽的五星红地的新中国国旗，在全营突击健儿面前授给主攻连——“七一功臣连”连长高就保。
    在一阵鼓掌声中，蒋教导员庄严地说：“现在我将这面新中国的庄严伟大的国旗，交给我们为人民立过功的‘七一功臣连’同志们，要求你们一定完成这个任务，把新中国的国旗插上厦门岛，插到我们突破口的神山顶去！来作为我们对新中国成立的贺礼！”
    当高连长严肃地接过国旗时，行列里立即发出一片昂扬的欢呼声：“坚决把国旗插上厦门岛！”
    国旗到了“七一功臣连”后，各个班排都轰动起来了。所有的突击队员们都要求担任这个光荣的任务。终于，国旗交到了三班，三班的同志们兴奋得跳起来。战士们对一排长张玉田说：“排长，你看，国旗一定能插上去。”三班长许纪和，这个在战场上一向是生龙活虎一样的勇士，更拍着胸膛说：“人倒了也不叫国旗倒下，这样的光荣任务还能不完成吗！”
    十五日夜，突击队的船只象箭一样的驶向厦门岛，“七一功臣连”三班的战士们特别用力的划着船向前急驶，但船在离敌阵地不远处的沙滩上搁浅了。敌人的机枪疯狂地扫射着。突击队的勇士们，冒着炮火，迅速地跳下船，在淤泥地里连爬带滚地冲过去。身背国旗的战士张村国冲得更快，他和全班战士一样，被一个伟大的信念鼓舞着：冲到最前面去，把国旗插上神山顶！他一边高呼着向前迈进，一边还十分注意着不使国旗沾上污泥。当他冲到离陆地还有二十多米达时，敌人的四颗机枪子弹打中了他的前胸，他倒了下来，但同班的朱洪生又迅速的取下了他身上的国旗冲了上去。
    神山脚下猛烈的短兵激战展开了。突击的勇士们，奋力英勇地追杀着残匪，猛虎一般地扑上了神山顶。黎明前，英雄们完全攻占了神山顶。在晨光曦微中，那面鲜艳庄丽的五星红旗在厦门岛上迎风地飘扬着。
