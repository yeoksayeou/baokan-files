　　The South China People's Liberation Army
  　Chief Representative Zhang Yunyi
    General Zhang Yunyi took time out from his busy schedule to meet with reporters. He first celebrated the success of the conference with the tone of an old revolutionary fighter who had experienced many hardships: "The CPPCC was very successful, and the Central People's Government has been established. This is the result of the Chinese people's struggle for many years, and this is the happiness of the people."
    General Zhang Yunyi is fifty-eight years old this year. He participated in the Xinhai Revolution at the age of twenty and began to devote himself to the revolutionary struggle, overthrowing the Manchu Qing Dynasty. Later, he participated in the war to protect the constitution and the Northern Expedition in 1926. However, the Kuomintang reactionaries, headed by Chiang Kai-shek, betrayed the revolution and carried out a cruel massacre of revolutionaries. At that time, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, he transferred to work in Guangxi. In southwestern Guangxi, together with General Deng Xiaoping, he created a people's own regime centered on Baise County—the Soviet regime, and established the people's own army—the Red Seventh Army. During the ten years of the land revolution, he always stood with the broad masses of the people, fighting a life-and-death struggle against the reactionary forces, until the Long March to northern Shaanxi. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, General Zhang served as the commander of the Jiangbei Headquarters of the New Fourth Army and the deputy commander of the army, and other important positions. He fought in central China, threatening Nanjing and Shanghai, making the enemy tremble and the people excited. Although the reactionaries launched several anti-communist upsurges, General Zhang always adhered to Chairman Mao's correct line and fought unyieldingly with the enemy and stubborn bandits, consolidating and expanding the forward positions of the anti-Japanese war behind enemy lines in central China. During the three-year War of Liberation, General Zhang served as the deputy commander of the East China Military Region and the commander of the Shandong Military Region. Together with General Chen Yi and General Rao Shushi, he smashed the Kuomintang reactionaries' key offensives against Shandong, annihilated a large number of enemies, and finally enabled the East China Military Region to switch from defense to offense together with the brotherly liberated areas across the country. Now he will take on the responsibility of the second secretary of the South China Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party and return to his long-separated hometown of South China, assisting General Ye Jianying in leading the millions of people in South China to fight to annihilate the remaining Kuomintang bandits. It is believed that before long, the five-star red flag of the People's Republic of China will be widely planted on the southern border of China.
    General Zhang led the South China Liberation Army delegation to participate in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and felt extremely excited. He told reporters: "The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference was convened on the basis of extremely broad unity, including representatives of various parties, people's organizations, the People's Liberation Army, liberated areas and areas to be liberated, various ethnic groups, overseas Chinese, and other patriotic elements, gathered together to discuss national affairs. This shows the great unity of the Chinese revolutionary people. During the meeting, everyone was able to fully express their opinions and get along harmoniously, which was not easy, especially the three major documents of the Organizational Law of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, The Organizational Law of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, and the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, which were successfully and unanimously passed without anyone opposing or doubting, which further proves the great unity of the people of the whole country. This democratic unity is a great revolutionary force, and this force can crush the conspiracies of all enemies at home and abroad and build our independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, and prosperous New China. Such a democratic and united conference has never existed in Chinese history. This is a great and epoch-making conference, and its impact on China and the world will be huge. The broad masses of people at home and abroad are concerned about its success, and our conference has successfully completed its great historical mission."
    Why was the conference so successful? General Zhang pointed out: "This is primarily due to the leadership of the Chinese people's leader, Chairman Mao. He personally participated in and instructed all important issues under discussion, giving direction to the conference. Secondly, it is because the conference highly promoted democracy under centralized guidance, and all representatives expressed their opinions from the standpoint of the people's interests, repeatedly studying and considering the principles and even the wording of each document, gathering wisdom and achieving unified opinions. Our conference is completely different from the bourgeois parliament. We made full preparations before each meeting, brewed them to maturity, and truly achieved knowing everything and saying everything during the discussion, giving full play to the wisdom and opinions of each representative. We not only solved problems at the general assembly, but also solved problems at the group meetings, and truly implemented the essence of democracy in action. We all believe that the three major documents unanimously adopted at this conference fully concentrate and express the will of the revolutionary people of the whole country and reflect the current realistic requirements of the Chinese revolution. We believe that these three major historical documents will surely be supported by the broad masses of the people across the country."
    Finally, the topic turned to the South China Liberated Area. General Zhang said: "The South China Liberation Army delegation has assured the conference that all resolutions will be conveyed to the Liberation Army and the broad masses of people in South China and will become the guiding principles for the actions of the military and civilians in South China. We will resolutely support the Central People's Government headed by Chairman Mao and, under his leadership, fight to eliminate the remaining Kuomintang bandits and build a New South China."
    "At present, many places in South China have not yet been liberated. Therefore, the task of our South China Liberation Army is, first of all, to implement Article 2 of the Common Program: to carry the revolutionary war to the end, to act jointly with the broad masses of the people and all democratic parties, to cooperate with the southward PLA, to actively fight, to completely eliminate the remaining bandits, to liberate the entire South China, and to complete the task of unifying the entire China."
    "South China is the southernmost defense line of the People's Republic of China. Imperialism may invade our borders at any time. Our South China Liberation Army must actively study and train, so that it can become a modern national defense force with a high degree of combat effectiveness, implement the provisions of the Common Program on unified command, unified system, unified organization, and unified discipline, and conduct revolutionary patriotism and internationalism education for the troops, so that our troops can become a strong people's liberation army. Under the leadership of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central People's Government, we will resolutely smash any arrogant aggressive conspiracies of imperialism, consolidate the national defense of South China, and safeguard the completeness of our country's territorial sovereignty. We will also jointly defend world peace with the Soviet Union and other new democratic countries."
    "The people of South China have long suffered greatly under the long-term heavy pressure and exploitation of imperialism, feudal forces, and bureaucratic capitalism. In addition to resolutely carrying out the tasks of a combat team, our South China People's Liberation Army must also resolutely carry out the tasks of a work team, mobilize the broad masses of the people, and organize their own organizations and regimes, especially first mobilize the broad masses of peasants, and implement rent reduction and interest reduction and land reform policies step by step, so as to achieve land to the tiller. We will also call on all officers, soldiers, and staff to actively participate in industrial and agricultural production, increase national wealth, and reduce the burden on the people without hindering the execution of military tasks. We believe that with the leadership of the Central People's Government headed by Chairman Mao, we will overcome any difficulties and complete the glorious task of building a New South China and a New China."

　　华南人民解放军
  　首席代表张云逸
    张云逸将军于会议百忙中，抽暇接见记者，他首先以备尝艰辛的人民革命老战士的口吻，庆祝大会的成功：“人民政协开得很好，中央人民政府成立了，这是中国人民多年来奋斗的成果，这是人民的幸福。”
    张云逸将军现年五十八岁，自二十岁就参加辛亥革命运动，开始献身于革命斗争，推翻满清帝制，嗣后复参加护法战役，和一九二六年的北伐战争。可是，以蒋介石为首的国民党反动派背叛革命，对革命者实行残酷的屠杀，那时他在中国共产党的领导下，转入广西工作，在桂西南与邓小平将军一起，创建了以百色县为中心的人民自己的政权——苏维埃政权，并建立了人民自己的军队——红七军，在十年土地革命当中，他始终与广大人民在一起，与反动势力作着生死的斗争，直至长征到陕北。抗战期间，张将军曾任新四军江北指挥所指挥员及副军长等要职，转战华中，威胁京沪，使敌寇丧胆，人民振奋，虽在反动派几次发动的反共高潮中，张将军一直坚持了毛主席的正确路线，与敌寇顽匪作不屈不挠的搏斗，巩固与扩大了华中敌后抗战的前进阵地。三年解放战争中，张将军任华东军区副司令员及山东军区司令员，跟着陈毅将军饶漱石将军一起，粉碎了国民党反动派对山东的重点进攻，歼灭大量敌人，而最后使华东军区与全国兄弟解放区一道，由防御转到进攻。现在他又将负起中国共产党华南分局第二书记的责任，回到久别的华南故乡，协同叶剑英将军领导华南千百万人民，进行歼灭国民党残余匪帮的战斗。相信不会很久，中华人民共和国的五星红旗，就要普遍地插到中国南部边疆上。
    这次张将军领导了华南解放军代表团，参加中国人民政治协商会议，极感兴奋。他告诉记者说：“中国人民政协是在极广泛的团结基础上召开的，包括了各党派，各人民团体，人民解放军，各解放区与待解放区，各民族，海外华侨及其他爱国分子的代表，共聚一堂，商量国家大事，这表示了中国革命人民的大团结。在会议当中，大家都能充分的发表意见，融洽无间，讨论问题，这是很不容易的，特别是中国人民政治协商会议组织法，中华人民共和国中央人民政府组织法，中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领三大文献，能顺利的完全一致通过，没有一个人反对或怀疑，这更证明了全国人民的大团结，这个民主团结是伟大的革命力量，这个力量就能够粉碎国内外一切敌人的阴谋，就能够建设我们独立、民主、和平、统一、富强的新中国。这样民主的团结的大会在中国历史上是从来没有的，这是一个伟大的有划时代意义的大会，对中国对全世界的影响都将是巨大的，国际国内广大人民都在关心着它的成功，我们的会议已经胜利地完成了它的伟大历史任务。”
    会议为什么会这样顺利的成功呢？张将军指出说：“这首先是在于中国人民领袖毛主席的领导，凡在一切重要问题讨论上，他都亲自参加指示，给大会指示了方向。其次是由于大会高度地发扬了集中指导下的民主，和全体代表都站在人民利益的立场上发表意见，对各个文件的原则甚至文句，都反复研究、考虑，集思广益，取得统一意见。我们的会议，和资产阶级的议会完全不同，我们对于每一个会事前都有充分准备，酝酿成熟，讨论时真正做到了知无不言，言无不尽，发挥了每个代表的智慧和意见，不但在大会解决问题，而且更在小组会解决了问题，真正在行动中贯彻了民主的实质。这次大会一致通过的三大文献，我们都认为是充分地集中表现了全国革命人民的意志，反映了目前中国革命的现实要求，相信这三大历史文件，一定能得到全国广大群众的拥护。”
    最后话题转向了华南解放区，张将军说：“华南解放军代表团已向大会保证，将一切决议传达到华南的解放军及广大群众中去，并将成为全华南军民行动的方针，坚决拥护以毛主席为首的中央人民政府，并在他的领导下为肃清残余的国民党匪帮，建设新华南而斗争。”
    “现在华南尚有许多地方没有解放，因此我们华南解放军的任务，首先就要执行共同纲领第二条：将革命战争进行到底，与广大人民，各民主党派，共同行动，配合南下的解放军，积极战斗，将残余的匪帮全部肃清，解放全华南，完成统一全中国的任务。”
    “华南是中华人民共和国最南部的国防线，帝国主义有随时侵略我边疆的可能，我们华南解放军必须积极学习和训练，使自己成为有高度战斗力的现代化国防军，执行共同纲领中统一指挥、统一制度、统一编制、统一纪律的规定，并对部队进行革命的爱国主义与国际主义的教育，使我们的部队能成为一支坚强的人民解放军，在中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会的领导下，坚决粉碎任何帝国主义一切狂妄的侵略阴谋，巩固华南国防，保卫我国领土主权的完整。并与苏联及各新民主国家共同保卫世界的持久和平。”
    “华南人民久在帝国主义、封建势力、官僚资本主义长期重压与剥削之下，生活非常痛苦，我们华南人民解放军除了坚决执行战斗队任务外，同时又要坚决执行工作队的任务，发动广大群众，组织自己的团体和政权，特别是首先发动广大农民群众，有步骤地执行减租减息及土地改革政策，以达到耕者有其田。我们还将号召全军指战员、工作人员，在不妨碍军事任务的执行下，积极参加工业和农业的生产，增加国家财富，减轻人民的负担。我们相信有了以毛主席为首的中央人民政府的领导，将会克服任何困难，完成建设新华南和新中国的光荣任务。”
