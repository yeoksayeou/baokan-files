　　【Beijing News】After thorough preparation, the Yanjing Paper Mill elected four worker representatives on the 12th of this month to establish a factory management committee. As the factory launched a democratic factory management movement, the factory administration accepted the correct opinions of the workers, dispelling everyone's concerns. Therefore, during the worker group discussions on the establishment of the management committee, everyone paid close attention and overcame the previous attitude of indifference. In the discussions, they also studied the specific situation of the factory and put forward many opinions on the qualifications of the representatives. Based on political performance, work attitude, and work ability, each shift nominated a total of eighteen candidates. From these eighteen, Shi Yuzhen, Chen Shunying, Gang Jixu, and Li Qingquan were elected as representatives to form the management committee together with the factory director Hu Tizhao, the Chinese Communist Party branch secretary Huang Ji, and the trade union director Zhang Zhengang.

    【北京讯】燕京造纸厂经过充分酝酿，已于前（十二）日选出四名职工代表，成立工厂管理委员会。由于该厂展开工厂管理民主化运动，工厂行政上接受职工正确意见，打破大家的顾虑，故在职工小组讨论成立管委会时，大家都很注意，克服了以往漠不关心的态度。在讨论中，并结合工厂具体情况研究，对代表条件亦提出不少意见。各班根据政治表现，劳动态度，工作能力等共提出候选人十八人，由该十八人中选出石玉珍、陈舜英、刚继续、李清泉等四人为代表，同厂长胡体昭，中共支部书记黄纪，工会主任张振纲组成管委会。
