　　The "Long Live People's Victory" large song and dance, created by the Third Department of Hua University to celebrate the People's Political Consultative Conference and the founding of the People's Republic of China, is scheduled to premiere at the Liberation Theater on the 15th of this month. The content is divided into ten sections including war drum dance, marching dance, flower drum dance, worker-peasant dance, flower offering dance, and border dance. The forms mostly adopt folk elements with processing, led by Guang Weiran for creation, and directed by Dai Ailian, Hu Sha, and others. More than two hundred people participate in the performance. The song and dance has been performed multiple times for the People's Political Consultative Conference and the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association welcome reception, and has been well received. (Yu)
　　　　Teachers College
　　Yesterday (12th) evening, Teachers College invited People's Political Consultative Conference representative Li Xiuzhen to speak. Li Xiuzhen very kindly told stories like chatting about family matters, describing how she supported the front lines during the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan and the three-year War of Liberation, sending her sons to join the army, delivering intelligence to the People's Liberation Army, and fighting against beast-like enemy troops under the threat of guns and knives. She said cheerfully and enthusiastically, "Following Chairman Mao will not be wrong, I must always, always follow Mao Zedong." Finally, she earnestly asked the students to go to the countryside after graduation to help illiterate farmers. Her words moved more than a thousand faculty and staff members, who unanimously shouted: "Strive for the people's education cause!"
　　　　Hebei High School
　　The Literary Research Association invited People's Political Consultative Conference farmer representative Li Xiuzhen to the school for a lecture at 2:00 PM on the 12th, with more than five hundred teachers, students, and workers participating. She patiently told everyone about her and women in the liberated areas' struggle history during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the People's Liberation War, and called on students to go to the countryside to work and improve the cultural level of farmers. During this four-hour lecture, dozens of rounds of enthusiastic applause erupted. After listening to the lecture, everyone was very moved and felt that they should learn from Li Xiuzhen's struggle experience and spirit. They believed that this lecture was the most vivid and rich major lesson.

　　　　Gao Gong
　　At the first Mid-Autumn Festival reunion after the founding of the People's Republic of China, more than one hundred interns from the National Advanced Institute of Technology (Gao Gong) in the Taiyuan area held a joint celebration at the Taiyuan Ordnance Bureau Repair Factory. Cao Huanwen, Deputy Director of the Engineer's Office of the Light and Heavy Industry Management Department, and Secretary Guo were invited to speak at the meeting.
　　The celebration venue was simple and solemn, with red and green slogans pasted on the walls, expressing the desire to humbly learn from the workers. Deputy Director Cao of the Industry Management Department said in his speech that there is a lack of industrial talents at present, and the past engineering education was actually disconnected from reality, and the distance between workers and engineers was very large. This defect must be overcome in future industrial construction, and a large number of engineering students are needed to participate. Secretary Guo greatly praised the students for putting down their student airs and enthusiastically helping the workers to engage in cultural and recreational activities, and quoted Mr. Lu Xun's words "willing to be an ox for the children" to encourage the students to integrate with the workers. Finally, he earnestly instructed several key points of the internship, requiring everyone to truly establish a correct viewpoint of serving the people. Internship instructor Li Shimin introduced the internship experience of the repair factory, explaining that the students and workers had a very good relationship this time, and effectively opened amateur learning classes, with a total of one hundred and thirty people signing up, divided into six classes of high and elementary levels, learning technology, Chinese language, politics and other subjects respectively. In addition, Yucai and other factories also introduced that the students helped to establish literacy classes, wall newspapers, singing teams, etc. After the meeting, a grand dinner was held, everyone was enthusiastic, sang to their hearts' content, and dispersed late into the night.

    中华人民共和国成立后的首次中秋团圆佳节，国立高工太原区实习生百余人假太原兵工局修造厂举行联欢会。并请轻重工业管理处工程师室副主任曹焕文及郭秘书莅会讲话。
    联欢会场简单严肃，墙上贴满了红绿标语，表示要虚心向工人学习。工管处曹副主任讲话说明目前工业人材缺乏，过去的工程教育实际是与现实脱节的，工人和工程师之间距离很大。今后的工业建设中要克服这种缺陷，并需要大批工科学生参加。郭秘书对同学们放下学生架子热心帮助工人搞文化娱乐，甚表赞扬，并引鲁迅先生“俯首甘为孺子牛”的话鼓励同学们和工人结合。最后谆谆指示几项实习要点，要大家切实树立为人民服务的正确观点。实习教员李士敏介绍了修造厂的实习经验，说明这次同学们和工人感情搞得很好，有效地开办了业余学习班，共有一百三十人报名，分高初级六班，分别学习技术、国文、政治等课。另外，育才等厂也介绍了同学帮助成立了识字班、壁报、歌咏队等。会后并举行大聚餐，大家热情洋溢、尽情高歌，直至深夜尽欢而散。
