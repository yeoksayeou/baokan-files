	7. The daily activities of the Young Pioneers should be reported to the higher authorities regularly (if you cannot write, please ask the instructor to write on your behalf); lower levels should implement various instructions from higher levels, and if there are different opinions, they should be promptly reflected to the higher levels. Before changes are received from higher levels, they must still be implemented, cultivating in members an organizational concept of obeying leadership and group resolutions.

	1. If one studies or works hard, is able to unite with children, and can quickly correct shortcomings, he/she should be publicly praised by the team and even given material rewards.
