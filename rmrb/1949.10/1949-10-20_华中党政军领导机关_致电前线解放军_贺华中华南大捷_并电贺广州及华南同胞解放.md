Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 19th. After the liberation of Guangzhou, the annihilation of the White bandits' four main divisions, and the victory reports from the People's Liberation Army on the southern front, the Central China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, the Central China Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the Central Plains People's Government jointly sent a telegram to all commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army on the Central and Southern China frontlines and the South China People's Guerrilla Force, expressing commendation and condolences: The telegram is as follows:

To all commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army on the Central and Southern China frontlines and the South China People's Guerrilla Force:

In the month-long operation to wipe out the remnant bandits, you have annihilated more than 50,000 enemies, liberated western Hunan, southern Hunan, and half of Guangdong, and liberated Guangzhou, the largest city in South China. In particular, the battle southwest of Hengyang annihilated the four main divisions of the White bandits in one fell swoop, thereby shortening the duration of the war and accelerating the liberation of the entire Central and Southern China region. All these great victories are due to the loyalty of all our commanders and fighters, who, in order to complete the great cause of unifying the country and liberating all the people, resolutely implement the orders of the Central People's Government, spare no effort, sacrifice, and bravely struggle. We extend our warm congratulations to you.

The remnant Kuomintang bandits have now become roving bandits, but with the shameless aid of American imperialism, they still want to carry out sabotage and disruption against the people's motherland. All our commanders and fighters must wipe out the remnant bandit forces completely, leaving no root of disaster. To this end, you should continue to carry forward the excellent combat style of this campaign, pursue and strike hard when you receive orders, not letting a single enemy escape; unite well with all fraternal units, unite with all the people, unite as one, and work together to accelerate the arrival of final victory.

Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 19th. The Central China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, the Central China Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the Central Plains People's Government jointly sent a telegram on the 15th to congratulate the liberation of Guangzhou and the compatriots in South China. The telegram is as follows:

To all compatriots in Guangzhou and South China:

Warmly celebrate your liberation and extend our heartfelt condolences for your long-term oppression by the Kuomintang bandit gangs.

Guangzhou, the birthplace of the Great Revolution of 1925-1927, the holy land of the Guangzhou Uprising and the Guangzhou Commune, and the largest city in South China, has been liberated. From Heilongjiang in the north to the South China Sea in the south, north-south transportation is now open, marking the appearance of the first truly unified national situation in our country's history. The revolutionary north and the revolutionary south, after more than twenty years of separation, have finally reunited.

The People's Republic of China has just celebrated its founding, and Guangzhou, the gathering place of the remnant Kuomintang bandits, has been quickly liberated, demonstrating the incomparably powerful strength of the Chinese people and the insignificance and fragility of imperialism and reactionary forces. The people of the whole country are cheering for your liberation.

Brave and hardworking compatriots in South China, you must carry forward the traditional revolutionary spirit, actively cooperate with the People's Liberation Army to eliminate the fleeing remnant bandits, and, under the leadership of the Central People's Government, abide by various policies and laws, quickly restore and develop industrial, commercial, and agricultural production, work hard on economic construction, consolidate national defense, and strive to build a new Guangzhou, a new South China, and a new China!

    并电贺广州及华南同胞解放
    【新华社汉口十九日电】广州解放、白匪四个主力师被歼和南线各路解放军胜利捷报传来后，中共中央华中局、中国人民解放军华中军区、中原人民政府特于日前联合电贺华中、华南前线人民解放军暨华南人民游击队全体指战员，表示嘉奖和慰问：电文如下：
    华中、华南前线人民解放军和华南人民游击队全体指战员们：
    在一个月以来扫荡残匪的作战中，你们歼敌五万余，解放了湘西、湘南和半个广东，解放了华南的最大城市广州，特别是衡阳西南一战，一举歼灭了白匪的主力四个师，从而缩短了战争的时间，行将加速华中、华南全部地区的解放。凡此伟大胜利，都是由于我全体指战员赤胆忠心，为了完成统一全国的伟业，为了解放全国人民，坚决执行中央人民政府的命令，不辞劳苦牺牲，英勇奋斗的成果。特向你们致以热烈的祝贺。
    国民党残余匪帮现在已经成为流寇了，但他们在美帝国主义无耻的援助下，还要向人民祖国进行揭乱和破坏，我全体指战员务必要将匪帮残余势力剿灭净尽，不使残留一点祸根。为此，你们应当继续发扬这次战役中的优良战斗作风，接到命令就要穷追穷打，不让一个敌人逃走；要很好地团结各兄弟部队，团结全体人民，万众一心，一致努力，以加速最后胜利的到来。
    【新华社汉口十九日电】中共中央华中局、中国人民解放军华中军区、中原人民政府于十五日联合电贺广州市和华南同胞的解放。电文如下：广州市和华南全体同胞：
    热烈庆贺你们的解放，并对你们遭受国民党匪帮的长年压榨致以亲切的慰问。
    一九二五——一九二七年大革命的策源地、广州起义和广州公社的圣地、华南最大城市广州城获得了解放，从此北目黑龙江南至南海，南北交通贯通，这是我国有史以来第一次的全国大统一的局面的出现。革命的北方和革命的南方，经过二十余年的分离，终于又汇合在一起。
    中华人民共和国刚庆成立，残余国民党匪帮的啸聚之地——广州迅即获得解放，表明了中国人民的强大无比力量，也表明了帝国主义和反动势力的渺小和脆弱，全国人民都在为你们的解放而欢呼。
    英勇而勤劳的华南同胞们，你们要发扬传统的革命精神，积极地配合人民解放军去消灭逃窜无门的残匪流寇，在中央人民政府的领导下，遵守各项政策法令，迅速恢复和发展工商业与农业生产，努力经济建设，巩固国防，为建设新广州、新华南、新中国而奋斗！
