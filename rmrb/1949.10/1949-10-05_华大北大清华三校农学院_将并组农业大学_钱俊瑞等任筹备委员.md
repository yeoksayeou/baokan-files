The Agricultural Colleges of Hua University, Peking University, and Tsinghua University
Will Merge into Agricultural University
Qian Junrui and Others Appointed as Preparation Committee Members

(Our Newspaper) In order to implement the New Democratic educational policy and enable university agricultural sciences to better cooperate with the agricultural construction of New China, the North China Higher Education Committee, accepting suggestions and requests from all parties, has decided to merge the agricultural colleges of Hua University, Peking University, and Tsinghua University into a national agricultural university. After multiple consultations, an agricultural university preparatory committee has been established, with members including Qian Junrui, Zhang Chong, Le Tianyu, Yu Dawei, Tang Peisong, and representatives of professors, lecturers, teaching assistants, and students from the original three universities, totaling seventeen people. Qian Junrui serves as the chairman of the committee, and Le Tianyu, Yu Dawei, Tang Peisong, Huang Ruilun and others serve as standing committee members. The campus will be located at the former site of the Peking University Agricultural College, and a temporary office will be set up in Luodaozhuang (the original Peking University Agricultural College) in the suburbs of Beijing. An inquiry office will be set up at the Jing Sheng Biological Investigation Institute in Beijing city. New agricultural college students admitted by Hua University, Peking University, and Tsinghua University this year will still report to their original admitting schools separately and will be sent to the Agricultural University when they are all gathered. Currently, all faculty and staff of the three university agricultural colleges are actively carrying out the work of preparing for the establishment of the university. This national agricultural university will be officially announced soon, and classes are expected to begin around October 10th.
