[Beijing News] The Mid-Autumn Festival celebration for comforting military families, organized by the Beijing Municipal People's Government Civil Affairs Bureau, was held yesterday (the 5th) at the Daguanlou, China Theatre, National Theatre, Changong Theatre, and Zhonglou Theatre respectively. Starting at 8:00 AM, various districts gathered and arrived at the respective theatres. First, the district heads of each district explained the significance of comforting military families, followed by the screening of the films "Democratic Northeast" and "Leave Him Behind to Fight Old Chiang!". Starting today, the Civil Affairs Bureau will also mobilize citizens to voluntarily donate gifts to military families to show their support.
[Our Newspaper] Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival, and all sectors of the capital will warmly comfort the troops and the families of military martyrs. In recent days, various districts have received a large number of donations and gifts, as well as letters of support, from workers, students, teachers, and citizens. Yesterday morning (the 5th), the First Police Station of the Outer Second Precinct held a mass meeting to convey the significance of comforting the families of military martyrs during the Mid-Autumn Festival. Within four hours, they received over 301,100 yuan in donations from various households, as well as soap, towels, and letters of support. Sun Yuanbin, a worker at Fengzeyuan, said: "Our brothers at the front lines disregard their own safety and are doing everything they can to eliminate the reactionaries and liberate the people of the whole country. They are fighting for all of us! We should do our best to take care of their families here." An old lady Zhao from Yunju Temple said: "The People's Liberation Army fought the Japanese and is now fighting Old Chiang, all for the sake of everyone. This old woman will eat one less steamed bun a day to show my support." Workers in the Third District had been preparing for a long time to comfort the troops. Workers at the Zhirenli Carpet Factory alone collected over 300,000 yuan in People's currency and over 1,000 mooncakes in one day. All workers, staff, and apprentices at Xiangliyong donated half a day's wages to comfort the troops. Workers at the Yanjing Paper Mill in the Fifth District and many rickshaw pullers were enthusiastic about comforting the troops. As of the 4th, they had received over one million yuan in donations and a large amount of flour, daily necessities, and stationery. The Beijing Municipal Joint Association of Primary and Secondary School Teachers and Staff issued a notice a few days ago, in addition to mobilizing members of each school to donate money or goods to comfort the troops, each school will also organize comfort groups to conduct cordial visits to the families of soldiers. Teachers, students, and staff of the Normal University launched a campaign to comfort the troops on the afternoon of the 5th, and within five hours, they received over 470 bars of assorted and combined soap and over 82,500 yuan in donations.
