Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 5th: The whole country continues to be jubilant about the Soviet Union's recognition of our Central People's Government. Students at Fudan University in Shanghai, after hearing that our Central People's Government was recognized by the great friendly nation of the Soviet Union immediately after its establishment, sang the national anthem, the Internationale, and the March of the Motherland, shouted slogans, and set off firecrackers. Chen Baichen, Mei Duo, and 46 other people from the film and theater circles jointly issued a written statement, believing that this proves that only by resolutely "leaning to one side" can world peace be safeguarded. The Student Union and the Education Union also issued statements expressing their congratulations. In Nanjing, when the public-operated wired radio plant's get-together heard the news of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and New China, the whole audience burst into thunderous applause, and the masses present raised their arms and shouted slogans such as "Long live Sino-Soviet friendship!" and "The two great nations of China and the Soviet Union unite to defend world peace!" Many government organizations and groups immediately took to the streets to publicize the news. When the news reached Hangzhou, the people of Hangzhou were holding a grand rally to defend peace and celebrate the establishment of the Central People's Government. The loudspeakers at the rally site loudly reported the good news, winning enthusiastic applause from the thousands of people inside and outside the venue. The conference also passed a telegram of respect to Marshal Stalin and Chairman Mao Zedong. The crowds in the Lushun-Dalian area who were reveling in celebration of the establishment of the Central People's Government shouted "Double happiness!" upon hearing the news. The "Truth News," the organ of the Soviet Army Command in Lushun, published an editorial entitled "A New Page in the History of Sino-Soviet Relations" to congratulate this epoch-making event. Ouyang Qin, Secretary of the CPC Lushun-Dalian District Committee, excitedly pointed out: This is the beginning of the people's China entering the world political arena as a great power.
