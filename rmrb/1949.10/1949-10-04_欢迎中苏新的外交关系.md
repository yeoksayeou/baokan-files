　　Welcoming the New Diplomatic Relations Between China and the Soviet Union
    On the second day of the founding of our People's Republic of China, the Soviet government, which has a deep friendship with the Chinese people, immediately became the first friendly country to recognize our country. This has made the people and government of our country feel infinite joy and encouragement. This proves Chairman Mao Zedong's words in his opening address at the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: "Our revolution has won the sympathy and cheers of the vast people of the world, and our friends are all over the world." We believe that many countries in the world that truly love democracy and peace, like the Soviet Union, will soon recognize the Central People's Government of our own people and be willing to establish diplomatic relations with our country and exchange envoys.
    The people and government of the great socialist Soviet Union have always maintained the most sincere friendly attitude towards the Chinese people during the thirty-two years since its founding, which is a universally known fact. In the past, however, due to the anti-Soviet and anti-people policies of the imperialist Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique, the friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union were constantly undermined. Even so, the Soviet Union overcame all difficulties and repeatedly extended its great enthusiastic helping hand, doing everything possible to assist the Chinese people, while the reactionaries always repaid kindness with ingratitude, doing everything they could to slander and smear the Soviet Union. The most obvious example is that recently at the United Nations General Assembly, the bankrupt Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's thieving company, under the instigation of the imperialist warmongering group, dispatched its exiled politicians such as Jiang Tingfu to carry out its unfounded provocative "accusations" against the Soviet Union, attempting to stir up an atmosphere of imperialist interference in China and war hysteria.
    However, now the situation has fundamentally changed. The Chinese People's Liberation War and the People's Great Revolution have overthrown the internal and external oppressors, and the People's Republic of China has been declared, which enables the Chinese people to establish new diplomatic relations completely different from the past directly and formally with the great socialist Soviet Union, according to their own wishes, through their own Central People's Government.
    Such new diplomatic relations are the most authentic international friendship relations between the people's own countries, completely dominated by their own wishes. This is established on the basis of both countries truly adhering to the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for territorial sovereignty. The new diplomatic relations established today between our country and the Soviet Union are unprecedentedly valuable and unanimously welcomed by the people of both countries because it not only realizes the Soviet Union's "consistent desire to maintain friendly relations with the Chinese people," but also realizes the long-term aspirations of the Chinese people. We are confident that the diplomatic relations established thereby must be unbreakable and permanent friendship relations, and they will inevitably increase day by day in their consolidation and develop increasingly.
    With such a solid relationship between China and the Soviet Union, we can also be confident that not only will the construction undertakings of our people gain extremely favorable conditions for rapid progress, but also the sovereignty of the Chinese people and the peace of the Far East will never again be subject to imperialist aggression and threats. This undoubtedly gives a serious blow to the imperialist plan to establish a new aggressive "Pacific Group."
    The Chinese people should deeply thank the socialist Soviet Union led by the great Stalin for the profound and unparalleled friendship given to us. The Chinese people must, as instructed by Chairman Mao Zedong, "make our nation a member of the great family of peace-loving and free nations of the world, working bravely and diligently, creating our own civilization and happiness, and also promoting world peace and freedom." We believe that "any foreign government willing to abide by the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for territorial sovereignty," as stated in the announcement of our Central People's Government, will be willing to establish friendly diplomatic relations with our country.

### 欢迎中苏新的外交关系

　　欢迎中苏新的外交关系
    在我中华人民共和国宣布成立的第二日，对我国人民具有深厚友谊的苏联政府，立即成为承认我国的第一个友邦，这使我国人民和政府一致地感到无限的欢欣鼓舞。这证明了毛泽东主席在中国人民政治协商会议开幕词中的一句话：“我们的革命已经获得全世界广大人民的同情和欢呼，我们的朋友遍于全世界。”我们相信世界上许多真正爱好民主和平的国家，都将和苏联一样，很快会承认我国人民自己的中央人民政府，愿意与我国建立外交关系并互派使节。
    伟大社会主义的苏联人民和苏联政府，在其建国三十二年来始终一贯地抱着对中国人民最真诚的友好态度，这是举世周知的事实。但在过去，由于帝国主义国民党蒋介石反动集团反苏反人民的政策，不断地破坏了中苏两国的友好关系；虽然如此，苏联仍排除万难，屡次伸出伟大热情的援手，尽一切可能援助中国人民，而反动派则始终是以怨报德，尽其毁谤诬蔑苏联之能事。最近在联合国大会上，已经破产了的蒋介石匪帮的窃盗公司，还在帝国主义战争贩子集团的嗾使之下，派遣其流亡政客如蒋廷黻者，进行其毫无理由的对苏联的挑衅“控诉”，企图掀起帝国主义干涉中国和战争歇斯底里的气氛，这就是最浅显的例子。
    然而，现在情况是根本改变了，中国人民解放战争和人民大革命已经打倒了内外压迫者，中华人民共和国已经宣布成立了，这就使得中国人民可以根据自己的愿望，由自己的中央人民政府，与伟大社会主义苏联直接地、正式地建立与过去完全不同的崭新的外交关系。
    这样新的外交关系，是人民自己的国家相互间完全由自己的愿望所支配的最真实的国际友谊关系。这是两国真正在互相遵守平等、互利及互相尊重领土主权的原则上建立起来的。我国与苏联之间今天所建立的这个新的外交关系之所以空前可贵而为两国人民所一致欢迎，就因为它不但实现了苏联“力求与中国人民维持友好关系的始终不渝的意愿”，并且更实现了中国人民长期渴求的意愿。由此所建立的外交关系，我们可以确信，它必然是牢不可破的永久的友谊关系，它必然会与日俱增其巩固程度，并日益发展。
    有了中苏两国这样巩固的关系，我们也就可以确信，不但我国人民的各项建设事业将从此获得突飞猛进的极为有利的条件，而且中国人民的主权和远东的和平亦将永远不会再遭受帝国主义的侵犯与威胁，这给予帝国主义企图建立新的侵略性的“太平洋集团”的计划无疑地是一个严重的打击。
    中国人民应该深深地感谢伟大的斯大林所领导的社会主义苏联给予我们的深厚无比的友谊，中国人民一定要照毛泽东主席所指示的，使“我们的民族从此列入爱好和平自由的世界各民族的大家庭，以勇敢而勤劳的姿态工作着，创造自己的文明和幸福，同时也促进世界的和平和自由。”我们相信：“凡愿遵守平等、互利及互相尊重领土主权等项原则的任何外国政府”，正如我国中央人民政府公告中所说的，都将会愿意与我国建立友好的外交关系。
