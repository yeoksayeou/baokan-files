Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 13th. Autumn rains have caused disaster in various parts of Henan Province. People's Governments at all levels are leading the masses in their efforts to carry out rescue work. From late August to mid-September, continuous autumn rains lasted for more than twenty days. Rivers in various places flooded and breached their banks due to the surge in floodwaters. In many areas, autumn crops were submerged, and other low-lying areas also suffered from severe disasters due to the accumulation of water that could not be drained. According to statistics from Xuchang and Shangqiu prefectures alone, more than 1,070,000 mu of land have been affected. For example, the Ying River within Xuchang Prefecture was blocked by silt in the riverbed. After the flood broke out, the river channel could not contain the water. On September 17 alone, there were 14 breaches, and the four counties of Yanling, Yancheng, Changge, and Linying were all affected by floods. Five counties in Shangqiu Prefecture also suffered from floods. The Yellow River and Luo River within Luoyang Prefecture also rose in mid-September. The Yellow River breached its banks in several places north of Mengjin City. The flooded area was approximately 25 square li. In Yiyang County, 35 percent of the autumn crops in two districts were affected. The Ying River and Shuangbo River within Huaiyang Prefecture also overflowed due to poor drainage. The disaster situation in other prefectures such as Nanyang and Shanzhou is also very serious. This flood occurred just before the autumn harvest, which has greatly affected the harvest in various places. In addition to the breaches of major rivers washing away autumn crops, sorghum, millet, sesame, beans, and other crops in general areas have universally lost their seeds or sprouted due to continuous rain. It is estimated that the severely affected areas of Xuchang Prefecture will only have an average of 30 percent of a normal harvest, while general areas will only have about 40 to 50 percent. Communist Party committees and people's governments at all levels are currently carrying out emergency rescue work. In areas with standing water, ditches are being dug and channels are being dredged to drain the fields in order to increase the area sown to wheat. At the same time, the masses are being mobilized to harvest or salvage crops in the water in order to increase the harvest. The Xuchang Administrative Office sent hydraulic technicians to the disaster areas on September 30 to conduct surveys and carry out repairs and dredging. The Luoyang Prefectural Committee and Shangqiu Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China also instructed their subordinate Party committees to cooperate with local governments and peasant associations to conduct specific investigations, appropriately resolve the housing problems of the disaster victims, and allocate a portion of the local grain and the grain saved by various organizations for relief. At the same time, the masses should be mobilized to help each other on a voluntary basis. The Shangqiu Prefectural Committee emphasized in its instructions that the masses should be mobilized to save food and be prepared for famine by storing large quantities of all edible substitutes such as tree leaves and wild vegetables in advance for use in the coming year.

　　河南各地秋雨成灾
  　人民政府积极领导抢救
    【新华社开封十三日电】河南省各地秋雨成灾。各级人民政府正领导群众努力抢救中。自八月下旬至九月中旬，秋雨连绵达二十余天，各地河流因洪水暴涨而决口，不少地区秋禾被淹，其他低洼地带亦因积水不能宣泄而酿成巨灾。仅据许昌、商邱两专区统计，受灾土地已达一百零七万五十余亩。如许昌专区境内的颍河，因河床淤泥阻塞，洪水暴发后，河身无法容纳，仅九月十七日即决口达十四处，鄢陵、郾城、长葛、临颍四县均遭水害。商邱专区亦有五个县遭水灾，洛阳专区境内的黄河和洛河亦于九月中旬涨水，黄河曾在孟津城北决口数处。被淹地区约二十五方里，宜阳县两个区受灾秋禾占其总数百分之三十五。淮阳专区境内的颍河、双泊河等也因宣泄不畅而溢水。其余南阳、陕州等专区的灾情也很严重。此次水灾发生于即将秋收之际，对各地收成影响很大，除各大河决口冲走秋禾外，一般地区的高粱、谷子、芝麻、豆子等亦因阴雨连绵，普遍脱粒或生芽。据估计：许昌专区各重灾区平均仅有三成年景，一般地区亦只有四、五成上下。各地中共党委和人民政府刻正进行紧急抢救工作。积水地区正开沟疏渠，排水脱田，以便增加种麦面积。同时发动群众收割或打捞水中的农作物，以求增加收获。许昌专署已于上月三十日派出水利技师，前往灾区勘查，进行抢修和疏导。中共洛阳专区、商邱专区两地委亦分别指示所属党委，协同各地政府、农民协会，进行具体调查，适当解决灾民的住房问题，并可由地方粮和各机关节约粮中抽出一部分进行救济，同时发动群众在自愿原则下互助共济。商邱地委在指示中特别强调：要动员群众省吃俭用，生产备荒，预先将一切可食的代食品如树叶、野菜等大量储存，以备来年渡荒之用。
