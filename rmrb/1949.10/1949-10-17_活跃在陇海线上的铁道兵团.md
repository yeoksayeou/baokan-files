　　The People's Train has already entered Guanyintang, and the railway between Luoyang and Guanyintang is now unobstructed.
　　"With the railway repaired so quickly, Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang cannot escape."
　　"With the railway open, the scattered bandits are gone, and the people's good days have arrived."
　　"The whistle blows, the train arrives, and the working people have support."
　　These are the slogans and banners of the people along the way welcoming the People's Train. They also express the common joy and happiness in the hearts of the people in western Henan.
　　In recent years, the people of western Henan, after liberation, have been concerned about the revival of the Longhai Railway every day, and have hoped every day that this thoroughfare connecting the Central Plains and the major artery supporting the Northwest could take on the great task of supporting the liberation of the whole country as soon as possible.
　　As early as this spring, when the bandit suppression troops cleared the bandits along the line, people were craning their necks and looking into the distance, "We haven't seen a train smoking for three years. When will it be open?"
　　The First Detachment of the Railway Soldier Corps, which had rapidly repaired the Beining Railway and the Luanhe River Bridge, was ordered to advance into the Central Plains.
　　The loud and powerful slogan "Repair the Longhai Road, liberate the Northwest" spread throughout western Henan.
　　In mid-June, the preliminary repair work of the western section of the Longhai Railway began. Overcoming the difficulties of insufficient materials and lack of tools, braving the scorching heat of the Central Plains, under the scorching sun, the soldiers started this great action of supporting the advancing army and building the people's motherland railway with twelve hours of intense work every day.
　　In July, the summer rain brought floods and raging waves. The Luoyang River pontoon bridge was destroyed. The Third Detachment of the Railway Soldier Corps, which had repaired the Jinpu Railway and completed the repair of the Huaihe River Bridge, had no time to rest and immediately headed west. On the banks of the 240-meter-long Luoyang River bridge, they completed this bridge spanning the bottomless river in ten days of round-the-clock intense work, ensuring the continued supply and transportation of road construction materials.
　　In August, the repair work progressed rapidly. In order to respond to the call to repair four kilometers every day, the soldiers waited on both sides of the roadbed before dawn. As soon as the engineering train arrived, they launched a heroic assault repair work, returning to their駐地 only late at night. On the long railway line, they engaged in a fierce battle with hunger, thirst, and sleepiness, and finally ensured the completion of the great task of advancing an average of four kilometers per day (calculated based on an average of twelve hours of work per day).
　　In September, continuous autumn rains swept through western Henan. Rivers rose everywhere, mountain floods broke out, roadbeds collapsed, and bridges were washed away. The soldiers of the Railway Soldier Corps put forward the slogan "Defeat the rain, defeat the flood", braving the torrential rain and stepping on the knee-deep mud to launch an arduous struggle. The sleepers were soaked and weighed more than 150 kilograms. The soldiers staggered and slipped as they carried them and ran. They fell and then climbed up again. Sweat and mud were mixed together. The spikes, decks, and screws were submerged in the rain. The soldiers picked them up with their hands, shook off the mud, and continued to hammer them down. The soaked cloth shoes were rotten by the rain. Everyone took off their shoes and ran barefoot on the uneven rainy road. Their clothes were all wet and there were no replacements, so everyone took off their shirts and wore only shorts, letting the icy rain and the constantly splashing mud pour down their bodies like water, pushing the People's Train forward step by step, repairing through Mianchi, repairing to Yinghao, and entering Guanyintang.
　　The people along the way welcomed their own troops with such jubilation. Every time they arrived at a village or town, people automatically organized rows of welcoming lines. When they repaired to Xin'an, a joint celebration meeting was held. The masses quietly waited in the venue for two hours. When the train arrived at Yima, dozens of bright red welcoming flags fluttered at the station. When they arrived at Mianchi, firecrackers crackled for half an hour. When they arrived at Guanyintang, the masses organized all six large round drums and twelve sets of gongs and cymbals in the town and four surrounding villages to welcome them at the station. Watermelons, cigarettes, and vegetables, one after another of condolences, and bright red congratulatory flags were sent one after another. Everywhere on the walls and on the train were pasted bright red slogans "Pay tribute to the Railway Soldier Corps" and "Pay tribute to the vanguard of the People's construction."

　　活跃在陇海线上的铁道兵团
    吴大中
    人民火车已经开进了观音堂，洛（阳）观（音堂）间铁路，从此畅通无阻了。
    “铁路修通这样早，蒋胡匪帮跑不了。”
    “铁路通了，散匪光了，人民的好日子到了。”
    “汽笛叫，火车到，劳动人民有依靠。”
    这是沿途人民欢迎人民火车的口号和标语。也正道出了豫西人民心里共同的欢欣和愉快。
    年来，解放后的豫西人民，没有一天不在关心着陇海铁路的复活，也没有一天不在希望着这支贯通中原的孔道，支援西北的大动脉，能早一天担负起支援全国解放的伟大任务。
    早在今年春季，当剿匪部队肃清了沿线的土匪的时候，人们就在翘首遥望着，“不见火车冒烟三年了，几时才能畅通呢？”
    迅速修复北宁铁路及滦河大桥的铁道兵团第一支队奉命挺进中原了。
    “修通陇海路，解放大西北。”的响亮有力的口号，传遍了豫西。
    六月中旬开始了陇海西段的初步抢修工程，克服了资材不足与工具缺乏的困难，冒着中原地区的酷暑，在长天无云的炎日下，战士们每天以十二小时的紧张工作，开始了这支援前进大军，建设人民祖国铁路的伟大行动。
    七月，暑雨带来了山洪和怒涛，洛河便桥冲毁了，修复津浦铁路，完成淮河大桥修复任务的铁道兵团第三支队，不得休整，立刻兼程西进，在长二百四十公尺的洛河桥梁两岸上，以十日间日以继夜的紧张工作，完成了这无底河上的横亘桥梁，保证了修路资材的继续供应与运输。
    八月，抢修工程迅速的进展着，战士们为了响应每日抢修四公里的号召，天色未明就守候在路基两侧，工程列车一到，就展开了英勇的突击抢修工作，直到深夜才返回驻地，在漫长的铁路线上，与饥渴和睡眼，展开了残酷的斗争，终于保证完成了每日平均前进四公里的伟大任务（按每日平均工作十二小时计算）。
    九月，豫西地区袭来了连绵的秋雨，到处河流涨水，山洪爆发，路基塌陷了，桥梁冲毁了，铁路兵团的战士们，提出了“战胜天雨，战胜洪水”的口号，冒着倾盆的大雨，踏着没膝的泥水，展开了艰苦的斗争。枕木浸湿了一百五十多斤的份量，战士们一歪一滑的扛起来就跑，跌倒了再爬起来，汗水和泥水混在了一起，道钉、甲板、螺丝沉没在雨水里战士们用手捞起来，甩掉了泥水，就继续打下去。浸湿的布鞋，被雨水泡烂了，大家一齐打赤脚，在凸凹不平的雨路上跑来跑去，衣服全湿了，没有替换的，大家就光膀子穿裤衩，让冰凉的雨水和不断横溅的泥水，从身上水注般的漫流下来，就这样把人民的火车一步步的推进下去，修过了渑池，修到了英豪，开进了观音堂。
    沿途人民是那样狂欢的欢迎着自己的队伍，每到一个村庄和市镇，人们都自动的组织了一排排欢迎的行列，修到新安为开联欢大会，群众静静的在会场里守候了两小时，车到义马，几十面鲜红的欢迎大旗飘扬在车站上，再到渑池，鞭炮断续轰鸣了半小时，到了观音堂，群众组织全镇和四乡所有的六台大圆鼓，十二付锣钹到车站来欢迎，西瓜烟卷蔬菜，一抬抬的慰问品，一面面鲜红的贺旗，接二连三的送过来，墙壁上，火车上，到处都张贴着“向铁道兵团致敬。”“向人民的建设先锋队致敬。”的鲜红标语。
