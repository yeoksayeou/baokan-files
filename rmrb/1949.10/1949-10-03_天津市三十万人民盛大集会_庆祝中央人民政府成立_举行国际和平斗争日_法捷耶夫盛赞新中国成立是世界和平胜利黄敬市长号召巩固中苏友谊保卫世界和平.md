[Special dispatch from our reporter in Tianjin, 3rd, 2:30 AM] Yesterday, all sectors of Tianjin held an unprecedentedly enthusiastic rally to celebrate the founding of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, oppose aggressive war, and support world peace. The People's Square was packed with 300,000 people, with at least tens of thousands more crowding outside the square. Guests attending the conference included the Soviet delegation led by Fadeyev, Italian Communist Party Central Committee member Spano, and the North Korean delegation led by Park Jung-ae.

The conference began in the evening, illuminated by brilliant lights and amidst the continuous sound of firecrackers. Mayor Huang Jing delivered the opening speech, first extending a warm welcome on behalf of the city's 1.8 million people to the Soviet delegation, the Korean delegation, and the Italian representative. He said, "Comrade Mao Zedong's election as Chairman of the Central People's Government is a great joy in the history of the Chinese people. We are willing to cheer for our victory." He then recounted that the victory of the Chinese revolution would not have been possible without the strong role of the Soviet Union in defending peace. "Therefore, we must consolidate the friendship between China and the Soviet Union and defend world peace in the future." He particularly pointed out that aggressors headed by US imperialism are clamoring for war everywhere, but the strength of the world's peace and democratic camp has become unprecedentedly strong and far exceeds the strength of the aggressive bloc. As long as the peace-loving and freedom-loving people of the world unite together, especially the two major nations of China and the Soviet Union, they will surely be able to smash the imperialist war conspiracy and achieve lasting peace. "Today is the day for the people of Tianjin to celebrate the founding of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, and it is also the festival of the world's struggle for peace. We must resolutely participate in the great ranks of the world's struggle for peace, grab the throats of the warmongers, and force them to maintain peace."

When Fadeyev appeared on the podium, which was woven into a silver seat by the lights, the audience cheered "Long live Sino-Soviet friendship" and interrupted his vivid and concise speech with thunderous applause. In his speech, Fadeyev said: "The Chinese people's celebration of the founding of the People's Republic of China and the Central People's Government is a great contribution to the cause of world peace. It is also a great failure for the aggressors. This is a victory for all the Chinese people and world peace. The Soviet people will do everything possible to help China's construction." Spano spoke highly of the heroic struggle of the Chinese people, saying: "The victory of the Chinese People's Liberation Army is a victory for peace, and this road is correct. It should be carried through to the end." Park Jung-ae said in her speech: "The victory of the Chinese people greatly encourages the Korean people who are fighting against US imperialism for unification and democracy. We must oppose the enemies who threaten peace until we win the final victory." Subsequently, Liu Ningyi, head of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Huang Huoqing, representative of Tianjin workers and mass organizations, Li Tianhuan, representative of the army, and Hou Debang, representative of the industrial and commercial circles, also spoke.

At night, a huge parade marched through the city to the accompaniment of gongs and drums. People danced the Yangko tirelessly, continuing throughout the night.

　　天津市三十万人民盛大集会
  　庆祝中央人民政府成立
    举行国际和平斗争日
    法捷耶夫盛赞新中国成立是世界和平胜利黄敬市长号召巩固中苏友谊保卫世界和平
    【本报记者天津三日二时三十分专电】昨天天津各界空前热烈地举行庆祝中华人民共和国中央人民政府成立，反对侵略战争、拥护世界和平大会。人民广场为三十万人所挤满，至少尚有数万人拥挤场外。参加大会的来宾，有苏联代表团法捷耶夫等、意大利共产党中央委员斯巴诺和北朝鲜代表团朴正爱等。
    大会是在傍晚灯火辉煌下及经久不息的鞭炮声中开始。市长黄敬致开会词，首先代表全市一百八十万人民向苏联代表团、朝鲜代表团及意大利代表表示热烈欢迎，他大略说：“毛泽东同志当选中央人民政府主席，这是中国人民在历史上的大喜事。我们愿为我们的胜利而欢呼。”接着他历数没有苏联的保卫和平的坚强作用，中国革命胜利是不可能的。“所以我们今后要巩固中苏两国的友谊，保卫世界和平。”他特别指出：以美帝为首的侵略者正在到处叫嚣战争，但世界和平民主阵营的力量已空前强大，已远超过侵略集团的力量。只要世界爱好和平自由的人民团结一起，特别是中苏两大民族团结在一起，就一定能够粉碎帝国主义战争阴谋，获得持久和平。“今天是我们天津人民庆祝中华人民共和国中央人民政府成立的日子，同时又是世界和平斗争的节日，我们必须坚决参加到世界和平斗争的伟大行列中去，扼住战争贩子的喉咙，强制他们保持和平。”
    当法捷耶夫出现于被灯光织成银座的讲台演讲时，会场欢呼“中苏友好万岁”，并以雷动的掌声打断他每段生动扼要的讲词。法捷耶夫在讲演中说：“中国人民庆祝中华人民共和国和中央人民政府成立，是中国人民对世界和平事业的伟大贡献。也是侵略者的大失败。这是全中国人民和世界和平的胜利。苏联人民一定尽其所能帮助中国的建设。”斯巴诺讲话，盛赞中国人民的英勇斗争，他说：“中国人民解放军的胜利，是和平的胜利，这条道路是正确的。应该把它进行到底。”朴正爱讲演说：“中国人民的胜利，对于为统一、民主而与美帝国主义战斗中的朝鲜人民予以很大的鼓励。我们要反对威胁和平的敌人，直到争取最后胜利为止。”接着，全总负责人刘宁一、天津职工代表及群众团体代表黄火青、军队代表李天焕、工商业界代表侯德榜等相继讲话。
    入夜，极大的游行行列，在锣鼓喧天中走遍全市。人们不疲倦的扭着秧歌，通宵不息。
