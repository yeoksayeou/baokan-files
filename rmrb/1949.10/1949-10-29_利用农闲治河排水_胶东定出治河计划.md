Utilizing Agricultural Slack Season for River Management and Drainage
　　Jiaodong Sets River Management Plan
[Our Newspaper] In order to vigorously carry out water conservancy work and considering the difficulties the masses may face in river management next spring, the Jiaodong Water Conservancy Bureau has formulated a water conservancy work plan for this winter and next spring to actively complete the flood discharge of the main tributaries of the West Sea and South Sea, and the canal drainage of the large basins. The scope of the project and specific requirements are: (1) It is determined that from early October to late November this year, efforts will be made to implement the straightening of the lower reaches of the Wei River, dredging of the lower reaches of the Bailang River, dredging and embankment construction of the lower reaches of the Shuangshan River, and the excavation of a new river channel for the Guan River shortcut. The above projects are relatively large and will be directly managed by the Water Conservancy Bureau. In addition, there will be dredging of the Longwang River, dredging and embankment construction of the Ziyang River, and canal drainage of Mibuwa, Xinanwa, Yong'anwa, Jiangshanwa, Fanglingwa, and Zhuyangwa. Because the projects are relatively small, the Water Conservancy Bureau will be responsible for surveying and designing, and then hand them over to local governments for construction. (2) Survey and design will be carried out this winter to prepare for construction next spring for the Wugu River and Wulong River. This winter, a pilot project will be carried out for the construction of check dams in Dazeshan, and the masses will be organized to prepare stone materials in coordination with local areas for construction next spring. In order to ensure the completion of the above tasks, several important links must be grasped: 1. First, we must recognize the current difficulties and the importance of production and construction, clearly establish the determination to serve the people, overcome the viewpoint of employment and merit, strengthen unity, and resolutely and victoriously complete the task. 2. We must conscientiously master the working method of the mass line, closely contact the masses, absorb the experience of the masses, combine it with scientific knowledge, and cultivate a large number of local water conservancy cadres through practical work. 3. Implement the work style and spirit of simplification and thrift, promoting hard work and burying oneself in hard work, overcome old technical viewpoints, and give play to the spirit of creation in work, in order to improve work efficiency and business capabilities.
