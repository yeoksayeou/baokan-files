[This report] The Rapid Development of Cooperative Undertakings in North China

Establishment of Over Ten Thousand Supply and Marketing Cooperatives in Half a Year

Promoting Stable Urban and Rural Production, Stabilizing Prices, and Ensuring People's Livelihoods

[This newspaper reports] Since the North China Cooperative Conference in January this year established the working principle of focusing on the development of supply and marketing cooperatives, and established leadership organizations from top to bottom, North China has focused on establishing new cooperatives on the one hand, and strived to reform old cooperatives on the other. As of the end of July, the entire region had established four provincial general cooperatives (the Suiyuan Province is under preparation), twelve municipal general cooperatives, nine prefectural cooperatives (five prefectural supervision offices not included), 188 county cooperatives, 469 district cooperatives, with a total of 9,724 cadres and staff, and capital equivalent to 64,131,567 jin of rice. In the whole area grassroots cooperatives were established (that is, cooperatives below the county and city level, including urban factories, institutions, school consumer cooperatives, production cooperatives and new rural market town cooperatives and the old cooperatives). According to incomplete statistics from six cities and 156 counties, there are a total of 9,585 grassroots cooperatives, with 2,231,829 members, with a total capital equivalent to 14,447,072 jin of rice. The number of members accounts for 3.28% of the total population of the region.

The main achievements in more than half a year are in the urban areas.

Ensuring Workers' Lives

Stabilizing Production Sentiment

(1) Organizing consumer cooperatives: Public factories and large private factories in the six major cities of Beijing, Tianjin, Tangshan, Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan, and Zhangjiakou all have employee consumer cooperative organizations, with a total of 204 employee consumer cooperatives and 431,011 members; 92 institutions consumer cooperatives, with 103,457 members; 205 citizen consumer cooperatives, with 300,354 members. Among various types of consumer cooperatives, citizen cooperatives have complex compositions and more problems. Consumer cooperatives rely on the support of state-owned enterprises and trade companies (such as Beijing and Tianjin Trade Companies providing a large amount of food, allowing cooperatives to take goods before paying; Beijing Cooperative Bank handling the cashier business for each cooperative, and ordering overdraft methods with the cooperatives, providing financial assistance, etc.); On the other hand, the cooperatives themselves also implement joint procurement, which has played a certain role in reducing intermediate exploitation and ensuring that wages are not affected by prices. In the five months ending at the end of July, Beijing and Tianjin sold 49 million jin of refined grains and more than 100 kinds of daily necessities worth 426 million yuan. These two items saved members 361 million yuan. Shijiazhuang sold production materials worth 8,102,716 yuan, an average of 3% lower than the market price, and sold living materials worth 3,325,350 yuan, an average of 7% lower than the market price. Since the establishment of the consumer cooperatives, most employees and their families have been given a certain guarantee in terms of living supplies, reducing the loss caused by price fluctuations, and have also played a certain role in stabilizing the production sentiment of workers.

(2) Organizing handicraft production cooperatives. Mainly weaving, knitting, spinning wool, carpets, construction, shoe making, sewing, etc. For example, the cities of Beijing and Tianjin supply raw materials below market prices through the city cooperatives in three ways: loans, exchanges, and purchases. They also try to help promote the sale of products and solve their financial difficulties, to resolve the production problems of the members. Shijiazhuang City organized soil, wood and tile workers' cooperatives, coordinated raw materials, contracted projects, and distributed profits according to labor, breaking the unreasonable phenomenon of foremen exploiting workers in the past construction teams.

Farmers Enter the City Conveniently, Urban-Rural Relations Improve

(3) Establishing cooperative warehouses and farmer hostels. Beijing, Tianjin, Baoding and Shijiazhuang have established a total of ten cooperative warehouses and farmer service stations, which have played a certain role in establishing new urban-rural relations, strengthening urban-rural material exchanges, and solving farmers' difficulties in buying and selling goods and accommodation. According to statistics from Beijing, Zhangjiakou, and Shijiazhuang in three months, farmer hostels accommodated 22,229 passengers, 5,624 carts, 8,719 livestock (statistics from Zhangjiakou City only), and 6,991 carts (statistics from Shimen only). The service stations provided farmers with low-priced accommodation and meals, and stored, transported, bought and sold goods for the farmers. Farmers entering the city were no longer rustic "bumpkins." Some farmers reflected: Having farmer service stations in the city is equivalent to having a home in the city.

The business target of the cooperative warehouse is mainly the cooperatives in various regions (including village and district cooperatives). For example, since the establishment of the Tianjin Cooperative Warehouse on May 21 to the end of July, there have been 56 cooperative units from various places in Tianjin, and the total transaction volume in July was more than 2.142 billion yuan.

In rural areas, the overall business of cooperatives at all levels in the past six months includes the following aspects:

Supporting Rural Production

Signing Production and Sales Contracts

(1) Combining agricultural loans to supply agricultural production materials. This is the main business of the cooperatives, and the results have been relatively large. According to incomplete statistics from ten counties in central Hebei from January to July, a total of 5,695,747 jin of cotton seeds and peanut seeds were loaned and sold, 1,997,153 jin of fertilizers were bought and sold, and more than 1,000 water wheels were loaned and sold in conjunction with water conservancy promotion. It also helped farmers build new wells, repair old wells, and open canals to restore and develop water conservancy; at the same time, a large number of agricultural tools were allocated and manufactured, and a livestock breeding station was set up to solve many difficulties for farmers.

(2) Supplying raw materials, purchasing products and supplying daily necessities. Cooperatives in new experiments mostly adopt this kind of business. For example, Lin Nancang in eastern Hebei supplies reeds and collects mats; Xianxian County in the heavily affected area supplies cotton, grain, coal and daily necessities, and purchases homespun cloth. In addition, businesses such as purchasing cotton with grain and fertilizer in advance directly organized production and solved the difficulties of the people's lives.

(3) Regarding exchanges between urban and rural areas and between regions, they mainly rely on cooperative warehouses in conjunction with trade companies. Recently, the method of signing contracts has been adopted to implement ordering and barter. This makes it easier to plan work, and can organize sporadic transactions into wholesale trade, reduce the impact of price fluctuations, and gradually support cooperatives. This autumn's purchase of cotton and the loan and exchange of wheat seeds will be mainly implemented through contracts. At the recent joint meeting of county and provincial cooperative directors in Chahar Province, 32 contracts were established between counties to solve production and sales difficulties. This is a new business method for organizing and developing cooperative business.

Main Shortcomings in Building Cooperatives in Half a Year

Failure to Implement the Mass Line

At present, there are still several important shortcomings:

1. The method of implementing the mass line in group organizations is insufficient. Generally, they commit the problem of doing everything for the masses, and do not dare to let go of mobilizing the masses and relying on the masses to do it themselves. Some counties do not dare to develop members, fearing that they will not be able to supply if they develop too many; some cadres in counties and urban areas believe that it is troublesome and not easy to do well to mobilize employees to run their own societies, and are willing to do it by administrative means. Cooperative cadres and funds rely entirely on the public rather than the members, and the "official run" atmosphere is very strong. For example, a county established two village cooperatives, one with an investment of 8 million and the other with 9 million, but the members invested very little. As a result, the members believe that the cooperative is a "public business," and of course they will not recognize themselves as the masters of the cooperative.

2. Lack of democratic system. Generally, county cooperatives and some city cooperatives neglect the organizational education of members, and fail to organize members' groups and members' representative meetings in a timely manner to implement the spirit of management and supervision by all members, leaving members in a scattered and disorganized state.

3. There is still a purely profit-making and purely commercial point of view in business operations. Some county cooperatives simply handle loans, or directly purchase and sell goods in the market, and the development of business is not combined with group organizations. As a result, a village cooperative has not developed in more than four months. Some factory employee consumer cooperatives, regardless of the needs of the members, conduct market operations and hoard and speculate in order to achieve profit; some are afraid of losing money when prices fluctuate and dare not operate. This approach must be quickly corrected.

4. Most areas do not pay enough attention to the transformation of old cooperatives, so the results are less; individual places have failed to transform old cooperatives due to eagerness for success, such as Tianjin County, which once required an old cooperative to be transformed within four days.

5. The organizational leadership is unsound, the quality of cadres is low, and there is a lack of business technology; moreover, there are too many redundant personnel and large expenses. The working methods of some county cooperatives still have a "one-size-fits-all" style, and they often give up their own economic work in order to cooperate with the central work. Most cadres still do not know how to do economic work, and replace economic working methods with administrative working methods. As a result, cooperative work is not done well and does not win the support of the masses. Therefore, strengthening cadre training and improving cadre quality are urgently needed.

6. The leadership policies in various regions are still inconsistent. Some areas believe that the policy of not dividing profits to grassroots cooperatives and not doing non-member transactions is "difficult to implement for the time being"; some areas start to build cooperatives and then develop them universally; some do not pay attention to rural cooperatives; these are all inconsistent with the spirit of the North China January Conference.

7. Although the relationship between cooperative and state-owned economic organs has improved, there are still uncoordinated phenomena in some areas. For example, some cooperatives try to take advantage of the public and do not repay debts for a long time; some trade companies cannot guarantee to sell goods below market prices; individual state-owned stores are unwilling to support cooperatives, thinking that "both parties are engaged in business, why low prices?" They still sell goods at high prices in secret, which are all urgently needed to be corrected.

　　华北合作事业迅速发展
  　半年建立万余供销社
    推动城乡生产稳定物价保障人民生活
    【本报讯】自本年一月华北合作会议确定了以发展供销合作为主的工作方针，并由上而下建立领导机构后，华北各地一方面有重点的建立新社，另方面努力改造旧社，截至七月底，全区已成立省总社四个（绥远省正在筹建中），市总社十二个，专区社九个（专区督导处五个未包括在内），县合作社一八八个，区分社四六九个，共干部人员九七二四人，资金折米六四、一三一、五六七斤。并在全区建立起基层社（即县市以下的合作社，包括城市工厂、机关、学校的消费社、生产社与农村新建的集镇社和旧有社），根据六个市、一五六个县不完全统计，共基层社九五八五个，社员达到二、二三一、八二九人，共有资金折米一四、四四七、○七二斤，社员人数占全区总人口百分之三·二八。
    半年多来的主要成绩，在城市方面。
    保障工人生活
  　安定生产情绪
    （一）组织消费合作社：京、津、唐山、石家庄、太原、张家口六大城市公营工厂及大的私营工厂，都有了职工消费合作社的组织，共计职工消费社二○四个，社员四三一、○一一人；机关消费合作社九十二个，社员一○三、四五七人；市民消费合作社二○五个，社员三○○、三五四人。各类消费合作社中，市民社成份复杂，问题较多。消费社一方面依靠国营企业和贸易公司的支持（如京津贸易公司供给大批食粮，允许合作社先取货后交款；北京合作银行代办各社出纳，并与合作社订透支办法，融通资金等）；另方面合作社自己也实行联合采购，在减轻中间剥削，保证工资不受物价影响上起了一定作用。截止到七月底止的五个月中京津两市共经售细粮四千九百万斤，日用品百余种共值四亿两千六百万元。这两项为社员节省了三亿六千一百万元。石家庄经售生产资料价值八、一○二、七一六元，平均低于市价百分之三，经售生活资料价值三、三二五、三五○元，平均低于市价百分之七。张家口市社自三月一日起至六月三十日售货总额一二四、一九七、七五三元，共为社员省钱四、四二九、三○九元。自消费社成立，大多数职工及职工家属在生活供给上给了一定的保证，减少了物价波动的损失，对安定工人生产情绪也起了一定的作用。
    （二）组织手工业生产合作社。主要是织布、针织、纺毛、地毯、建筑、制鞋、缝纫等。如京津两市，均通过市社以贷、换、购三种方式，低于市价供给原料，并设法帮助推销产品，替他们解决资金困难，解决社员生产问题。石家庄市组织土木瓦工人合作社，统筹原料，包揽工程，按劳分红，打破了过去修房班中工头剥削工人的不合理现象。
    农民进城方便城乡关系改善
    （三）成立合作货栈与农民招待所。京、津、保、石共建立合作货栈及农民服务所十处，对建立新的城乡关系与加强城乡物资交流，解决农民买卖货物与食宿困难起了一定作用。据京、张、石三个月统计，农民招待所共住旅客二二，二二九人，大车五，六二四辆，牲口八，七一九个（只张市统计），小车六，九九一辆（只石门统计），服务所低价招待农民食宿，代农民保管、运输、买卖货物，农民进城再不是乡下“老憨”了，有的农民反映：城市有了农民服务所，就等于在城市安了个家。
    合作货栈经营对象，主要是各地区合作社（包括村、区社）。如天津合作货栈，从五月二十一日成立到七月底，各地来津合作社即有五十六个单位，七月份交易总额为二十一亿四千二百三十八万余元。
    在农村，半年来各级社业务总括有如下几方面：
    扶植农村生产
  　订立产销合同
    （一）结合农贷，供给农业生产资料。此为各社主要业务，收到成绩也较大，只冀中十个县一至七月份不完整统计，共贷卖棉籽、花生籽种五，六九五，七四七斤，买卖肥料一，九九七，一五三斤，结合水利推进社贷卖水车千余辆，并帮助农民造新井，修旧井，开渠，以恢复与发展水利；同时调剂修造大批农具，设有种畜站繁殖牲畜，解决农民不少困难。
    （二）供给原料、收购产品及供给日用必需品。各社在新的试验中多采取此种业务，如冀东林南仓，供苇收席；重灾区的献县四十八村供应棉、粮、煤和日用品，收购土布。此外，以粮食肥料预购棉花等业务，都直接组织了生产，解决了群众生活困难。
    （三）关于城乡及地区之间交换，主要是靠合作货栈结合贸易公司进行，最近才开始采取订合同办法，实行订货换货。这样就比较容易计划工作，可以将零星交易组织成批发贸易，减少物价波动影响，并可有步骤的将合作社扶持起来。今秋收购棉花与贷换麦种均将主要通过合同来执行。最近察省县、省社主任联席会上，县与县立了三十二个合同，以解决产销困难，这是组织与开展合作业务的新经营方式。
    半年建社主要缺点
  　没有贯彻群众路线
    目前，还存在几个重要缺点：
    一、组社中贯彻群众路线的方法不够。一般的犯包办代替毛病，不敢放手发动群众与依靠群众大家动手去办。有的县不敢发展社员，怕发展多了供给不上；有的县及市区干部，认为发动职工自己办社麻烦，不易办好，愿从行政方面包办。合作社干部与资金则完全不靠社员而单纯依靠公家，“官办”气很大。如某县建立二村社，一个投资八百万，一个九百万元，而社员入股很少。结果社员认为合作社是“公家买卖”，当然更不会认成自己是合作社的主人了。
    二、缺乏民主制度。一般县社与部分市合作社，忽视社员的组织教育，未能及时组织社员小组、社员代表会，贯彻全体社员管理与监督精神，使社员处于分散零乱状态。
    三、业务经营中仍存在单纯盈利、单纯商业观点。有的县社单纯办理贷款，或直接在市场购销物品，发展业务未曾与组社相结合，结果四个多月，一个村社也未发展。有的工厂职工消费社，不顾社员需要，进行市场经营，囤积倒把，以达盈利目的；有的在物价波动时，怕赔本，不敢经营。这种作法须迅速纠正。
    四、大部地区对改造旧社不够重视，因此收到成绩较小；个别地方改造旧社，因急于求成而失败，如天津县曾要求四天之内改造一个旧社。
    五、组织领导不健全，干部质量低，缺乏经营技术；而且冗员太多，开支大。某些县社工作方法仍存在“一揽子”作风，经常为配合中心工作而放弃本身经济工作，大部分干部仍不懂得怎样去作经济工作，以行政工作方法代替经济工作方法，结果使合作工作搞不好，得不到群众拥护。因此加强干部训练，提高干部质量是迫切需要的。
    六、各地领导方针尚不一致。有的地区对基层社不分红，不做非社员交易的方针，认为“暂难执行”；有的地区开始建社，即普遍发展；有的对农村合作社不加重视；这些都是与华北一月会议精神不符合的。
    七、合作社与国营经济机关的关系，虽有进步，但某些地区仍存在不调协现象。如有的合作社企图占公家便宜，欠款长久不还；有的贸易公司不能保证低于市价售货；个别公营商店不愿扶助合作社，认为“两方都是经营买卖，为什么低价？”暗中仍以高价售货，都是急需纠正的。
