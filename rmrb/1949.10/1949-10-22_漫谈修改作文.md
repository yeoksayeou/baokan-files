　　Rambling Talk on Revising Compositions
    Zhang ＠min
    Regarding the revision of compositions, there are some different opinions within our school's Chinese language research group: some advocate for more revision, while others advocate for retaining more. Regarding writing comments, some want more encouragement, and some want more criticism. Now I would like to offer some preliminary opinions on this issue for discussion with everyone:
    (1) The issue of more revision versus more retention: Generally speaking, I advocate for retaining more and do not agree with excessive deletion and revision. I believe that the following situations are the only ones where emphasis should be placed on revision:
    (1) Inconsistent with facts: For example, if a student writes "The Red Army's 25,000-li Long March" as "45,000-li Long March," it must be corrected. Even in stories, fairy tales, and fables, although the sun, moon, stones, toads... can be made to talk and laugh, they must still conform to the principles of nature. Saying that the sun rises from the west is not acceptable. Similarly, in the new Peking opera "The Zhongshan Wolf," it can only be said that the pale-faced scholar made friends with the wolf; it would be incorrect to say that a farmer made friends with the wolf, because farmers are familiar with the nature of wolves. If this principle is violated, it must also be corrected.
    (2) Full of empty talk and pointless moaning: I remember when reviewing student compositions during this year's "May Fourth" celebration, I saw a composition by a student. He wrote about "building a wall," and before he even started working, he had already written three or four pages. When it came to writing about the actual construction and work, he glossed over it in just a few words. This kind of empty article should be vigorously corrected.
    Some students probably read books like "Model Compositions" from the old days and brought that kind of unhealthy, sentimental tone of "feeling sad at the sight of the moon" and "shedding tears at the sight of flowers" into their own compositions. In a classmate's article about missing friends, it was all clichés like "the moon is never always full" and "no feast lasts forever." Another classmate, in a text examining his own lack of progress in learning, mentioned shedding tears four or five times. This kind of unhealthy emotion is fundamentally opposed to our cultivation of heroic and progressive revolutionary thought and must be vigorously corrected. In addition, issues such as structures that start but don't finish, repetition, disjointed middles, and reversed order must also be noted and appropriately revised.
    For other general issues of wording, as long as it makes sense, I believe we should retain as much of the author's original wording and meaning as possible and avoid deleting too much. Usually, we should just smooth out the sentences or correct typos. If too much is deleted and revised, the author will lose confidence and be afraid to write (some students have reflected this). Compositions by some less proficient students are often clumsy and stiff in wording, reading awkwardly. If you don't consider their level and only pursue the perfection of the article, revising their work to be very beautiful to the point of losing the original meaning and deviating from their cultural level, that is not right. Because that is no longer their own thing, that is "forcing growth," which is of no benefit to them. Therefore, revising compositions must take into account the student's cultural level and avoid deleting too much, and improve them on their existing foundation.
    (2) The issue of more encouragement or more criticism in the comments: Comments should pay attention to appropriate encouragement and avoid solely nitpicking their shortcomings. Beginners in writing often make mistakes such as repetition, redundancy, stiff wording, and imprecise language. Although these things may be numerous for the time being, it must be recognized that these will be overcome in the process of progress. If you only see the shortcomings and not the future development prospects, you are making a mistake. You will dampen their writing enthusiasm and cause them to lose confidence. You must see the good aspects of the article, praise it, and develop it. As long as there is relatively good content, even if the sentences are a bit stiff or repetitive, it should still be regarded as a good article (of course, this does not mean that inappropriate wording should be ignored). Even if most of it is not good, but there is one good point, it should not be completely negated, especially for people who usually don't write well, if they suddenly make progress, they should be heavily praised to stimulate their writing enthusiasm, which will be of great help to their progress.
    The above two points are my personal opinions. In addition, I can also write out the characteristics of Lu Xun's revision of young writers' manuscripts for everyone's reference: "Giving more encouragement than revision to beginners, being more tolerant... Always trying to respect the author's opinions, except for typos and sentences that are not smooth, making slight modifications, generally unwilling to delete too much" ("Researching Lu Xun's Literature, Answering Questions from Soviet Friends" - Jing Song). Although students are not writers, we cannot compare ourselves to Lu Xun, but his spirit of "more encouragement," "respecting the author's opinions," and "unwilling to delete too much" is worthy of our learning.

    Editor's Note: We believe that articles with ideological errors must be well revised, and should be emphasized and corrected in the comments. In this way, it is not only to guide students' writing technically, but also to educate students ideologically, overcome various incorrect thoughts, and enable them to seek progress ideologically, which should be an important task for every Chinese language teacher.

　　漫谈修改作文
    张＠民
    关于修改作文，我们学校的国文研究组里有些不同的见解：有些人主张多修改，有些人主张多保留。对写批语的主张，有的要多鼓励，有的要多批评。现在我就这个问题提出初步意见和大家商榷：
    （一）多修改与多保留的问题：一般来说我是主张多保留，不赞成多删改的。我觉得应当着重修改的只有下列几种情形：
    （１）与事实不符：如一个同学把“红军二万五千里长征”写成“四万五千里长征”了，是必须改正的，即便是故事、童话、寓言，尽管太阳、月亮、石头、虾蟆……可以叫他会说会笑，但也要合乎自然的道理，说太阳从西边出来是不行的。再如新平剧“中山狼”中只能说那白面书生和狼做朋友，若说一个农民和狼做朋友就不对了，因为农民是熟习狼的性质的，如果违反了这个道理，也要改正。
    （２）空话连篇与无病呻吟：记得今年“五四”时评论同学作文，我看见一位同学的一篇作文，他写“修筑围墙”还没有说到动手，已经写了三四张纸，等到写动工及工作情形，却三言两语飞过去了，这种空洞文章，是应该大力纠正的。
    有的同学大概看过旧时代的“模范作文”一类的书，也把那种“见月伤心”“对花流泪”的不健康的伤感情调搬到自己作文上来了。某同学在想念朋友的文章里，全是“月无长圆”“筵席无不散”之类的滥调。另一个同学在检讨自己学习不进步的文字中，光说落泪就说了四五次，这种不健康的情感和我们培养英勇前进的革命思想根本相反，必须大力纠正。此外如结构中有头无尾，前后重复，中间不接，次序颠倒等毛病也须注意，适当的修改。
    其它一般字句上的毛病，只要讲得通，我以为尽量多保留作者原句原意，不要删削太多，普通只给他顺顺句，或修改一下错别字就得了，如果删改太多，他自己就失去信心，不敢动笔了（同学也有这样反映）。有些程度差的同学作文，往往是字句笨拙、生硬，读起来“诘屈聱牙”，你如果不照顾他的程度，光追求文章的完美，把他的作品都修改的很漂亮，以至失去原意，离开了他的文化水平，那是不对的，因为那已经不是他自己的东西，那就是“揠苗助长”，对他并无好处的。所以改文必须注意照顾他的文化水平，不要删改太多，应在他现有的基础上提高一步。
    （二）评语中多鼓励或多批评的问题：评语中应当注意适当的鼓励，不可一味挑剔他的缺点。初学作文的人，往往容易犯重复、累赘、字句生硬、词不达意等毛病，这些东西虽然暂时还不少，但必须认定这些是会在进步中克服的，如果只看见缺点，而看不见将来的发展前途，你就是犯错误，你会打击了他的写作情绪，使他失掉信心；必须看到文章里好的方面，表扬它，发展它，只要有比较好的内容，就是句子生硬一点，重复累赘一点，也还要当作好的文章看（当然不是说不适当的字句就不管了），即便大部分不好只有一处好一点，也不可一概抹煞，尤其是对平常作文不太好的人，忽然有了进步，更要着重的表扬他一番，鼓动他的写作情绪，对他的进步会有很大的帮助。
    以上两点是我个人的意见，此外，我还可把鲁迅批改青年作家文稿的特点写出来供大家参考：“在初学写作者奖励多于修改，比较宽容些……总极力尊重作者意见，除了错字，句子欠顺，稍加修改之外，大约总不肯删削太多的”（“研究鲁迅文学，答苏联友人问”——景宋）虽然学生不是作家，我们不能比鲁迅，但他这种“多鼓励”、“尊重作者意见”、“不肯删削太多”的精神，是值得我们学习的。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    编者按：我们觉得，对于思想错误的文章，必须很好加以修改，而且需在批语中着重指出、纠正。这样，就不仅是在技术上来指导学生的作文，而且必需在思想上教育学生，克服各种不正确的思想，使他在思想上求得进步，这应该是我们每一个国文教师的重要任务。
