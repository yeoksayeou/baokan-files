Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 5th: According to a TASS dispatch from Athens: The Athens royalist fascist government, disregarding protests from democratic organizations around the world, brazenly executed the prominent Greek trade union leader and Chairman of the Electrical Workers' Union, Diostherfinos Giou, who had been sentenced to death, on September 30th. The execution was carried out under the special order of the Athens Minister of Justice. On September 28th, the Athens military court also tried thirty-eight communists from Piraeus, including the prominent Greek women's leader, Katrin Taragani. She had previously been sentenced to death at an earlier trial, but the execution was not carried out because the verdict was not unanimous.

The atrocities of the Athens fascists are increasingly arousing the anger of progressive people all over the world. Recently, the American Committee for Aid to Democratic Greece and the American Women's Assembly have announced that they will soon submit a petition with 200,000 signatures to the US delegation attending the UN General Assembly, demanding a stay of execution for Taragani, the withdrawal of US troops stationed in Greece, and the cessation of interference in Greek internal affairs.

    不顾民主舆论抗议杀害工会领袖乔久
    【新华社北京五日电】据塔斯社雅典讯：雅典保皇法西斯政府不顾世界民主团体的抗议，于九月三十日悍然杀害被判死刑的希腊著名工会领袖电气工人工会主席狄奥斯尔费诺斯·乔久，枪决是奉雅典司法部长的特别命令执行的。九月二十八日，雅典军事法庭又审讯三十八位比里犹斯的共产党人，其中有希腊著名妇女领袖卡特林·塔拉甘尼。她于上次审判时已被判死刑，但因判决不是一致通过的，所以没有执行枪决。
    雅典法西斯的暴行愈益引起全世界进步人民的愤怒，最近又有美国援助民主希腊委员会和美国妇女大会宣布即将向出席联大美国代表团提出二十万人签名的请愿书，要求停止对塔拉甘尼的执刑，要求撤退美国驻希军队，并停止干涉希腊内政。
