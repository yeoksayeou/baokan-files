Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, October 28th: An incident occurred in Shenyang in which American national Wald (former Consul General of the United States Consulate in Shenyang) led a mob to beat worker Ji Yuheng, causing serious injuries, which has aroused the anger of people from all walks of life. The incident is as follows: On September 27th, Wald ordered Chinese worker Ji Yuheng to perform heavy dismantling labor that he was incapable of doing alone, and prevented other workers from helping. He himself ridiculed him from upstairs. Ji Yuheng, feeling excessively humiliated, stated that he could not do it. Wald then took the opportunity to drive Ji out of 38 Sanjing Road (former address of the U.S. Consulate). The next morning, Wald told Ji: "You refused to work, now you are suspended. You are not qualified to stay in the U.S. government building." Ji then stated to Wald that he was not refusing to work, only that he could not do the work that he could not handle alone. Wald ignored him and forcibly pushed Ji outside. Ji had no choice but to request a settlement of his due wages, vacation pay, severance pay, wage deductions, etc., but Wald only agreed to issue wages at his discretion, refusing to pay for anything else. On October 10th, Ji Yuheng went again to request the issuance of his due wages, vacation pay, severance pay, etc. Wald still insisted on only giving wages, firmly refusing to issue vacation pay, severance pay, wage deductions, etc., and pushed Ji out of the room. There was still no result that evening. On the morning of the 11th, Wald saw that Ji had not left the previous night, and immediately found Ji Yuheng and cursed: "Bastard! Get out!" and together with Italian Hickney, pushed and beat Ji from the upper floor of 38 Sanjing Road to the ground floor. At the door downstairs, Japanese-American Isojiro also joined in the beating. At this time, Zhang Zhongying, Fang Pinqing, and Yue Shanyi, three employees of the place, witnessed the event. Around 9 o'clock, Wald asked Ji to go to the accounting room upstairs. An American named Rehberg pressed Ji's hand and forced him to sign for the money. Because the amount was insufficient, Ji demanded that it be fully paid. Rehberg said: "If you don't take it, get out quickly!" and pushed Ji forcefully. At this time, Wald gathered other foreign employees Hickney, Isojiro, Rehberg, and Kritan, and blocked Ji, attacking him with fists and feet, and beating him severely. Ji Yuheng's younger brother, Ji Yufeng, went upstairs to dissuade them, but was also blocked and beaten by Rehberg and Kritan at the stairway entrance. At that time, all the Chinese workers and staff at the place witnessed Wald and others daring to be so barbaric and tyrannical under our people's democratic government, oppressing workers and infringing on human rights. They were extremely indignant and immediately sent people to report to the Shenyang Municipal People's Government. The Shenyang Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau and People's Court immediately dispatched personnel to rush to the scene at about 10 a.m. that day for inspection and handling. After examination by the court's forensic doctor, the results were: Ji Yuheng had a skinned wound on the front of the right side of his forehead, 5 @ long and 4 @ wide, and abrasions on his buttocks. The injured person was suffering from concussion, was unconscious, incontinent, and in life-threatening condition. According to the court's forensic doctor, the injury was indeed caused by violent beating. The injured was immediately sent to the hospital for emergency treatment. The above on-site inspection situation has been witnessed and confirmed to be true by the plaintiff, the defendant, the inspectors, and the witnesses. After the incident, the 35 Chinese workers and staff members of the place have jointly submitted a written accusation to the government against the barbaric act of American national Wald and others for gathering a crowd to beat Chinese workers. The Shenyang Municipal People's Government, in order to maintain the laws and disciplines of the People's Republic of China and protect human rights, has decided to accept this accusation and adjudicate according to law.

    制裁帝国主义分子的横暴行为
    【新华社沈阳二十八日电】沈阳市发生美国侨民瓦尔德（前美国驻沈阳领事馆总领事）聚众殴打工人姬玉衡，造成重伤事件，已引起各界人民的愤怒。该事件经过如下：九月二十七日，瓦尔德令中国工人姬玉衡一人从事力不胜任的繁重的拆卸劳动，并阻止其他工人前往帮助，他本人则在楼上予以嘲笑。姬玉衡受辱过甚，遂表示做不了。瓦尔德则趁机将姬赶出三经路三十八号（前美驻沈领事馆地址）。次晨瓦告姬说：“你拒绝工作，现在给你停职，你无资格再在美国政府厅厦内逗留。”姬当向瓦声述并非拒绝工作，仅是不能做他独自不能胜任的工作。瓦毫未理睬，并以暴力将姬推至室外。姬无奈乃要求结算他应得的工资及休假金、遣散费、工资扣留金等，但瓦只允酌发工资，其他一概不付。十月十日，姬玉衡又往要求发给应得的工资、休假费、遣散费等，瓦尔德仍坚持只给工资，对休假费、遣散费、工资扣留金等项坚不发给，并推姬去室外，当晚仍无结果。十一日晨，瓦尔德见姬昨晚未走，即找到姬玉衡骂道：“混蛋！滚出去！”并与意大利人希克尼将姬由三经路三十八号楼上推打至楼下，至楼下门口时，美籍日人异四郎亦加入殴打。此时有该处职工张仲英、房品卿、岳善义三人在场目睹。九时左右，瓦尔德要姬去楼上帐房。美人雷贝格即按姬手强迫其签字领钱。姬因款数不足，要求全部发给，雷贝格说：“你不领赶快出去！”并用力推姬。这时瓦尔德即纠合其他外籍职员希克尼、巽四郎、雷贝格及克立坦四人将姬堵截，拳脚交加，群起殴打。姬玉衡之弟姬玉峰上楼劝解，亦遭到雷贝格和克立坦堵在楼梯口处拖住殴打。当时该处全体中国工人及职员，目睹瓦尔德等在我人民民主政权下，竟敢如此野蛮横暴，压迫工人，侵犯人权，极为愤慨，当即派人向沈市人民政府报告。沈阳市人民政府公安局、人民法院迅即派员于当日午前十时许赶赴现场检查处理。当经法院法医检验结果：姬玉衡头部右侧额角前有削皮伤一处，长五＠，宽四＠，臀部有擦皮创伤，伤者已因脑震荡，神志不明，小便失禁，有生命危险。据法院法医验明，此伤确系因暴力毒殴所致。伤者当即送往医院实行紧急治疗。以上现场检查情况，已由原告，被告，检查者，旁证者共同亲睹证明属实。事件发生后，该处三十五名中国工人职员，对美侨瓦尔德等这一聚众殴打中国工人的野蛮行为，已向政府联名提出书面控诉。沈市人民政府，为维护中华人民共和国的法纪，保障人权起见，已决定受理这一控告，依法审判。
