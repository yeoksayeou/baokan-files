It is well known that the Communist Party of the United States is the strongest fighter against the Truman reactionary government's war preparations and in defense of the American people's right to life and democratic freedom. For the lofty interests of the American people, it has fought unyieldingly for thirty years. However, now, these finest sons and daughters of the American people, the loyal and glorious fighters for the cause of the working class—the eleven leaders of the CPUSA—have been falsely accused by the U.S. imperialist New York Federal Court of seeking the rights and freedoms of the people, illegally sentenced to five or three years in prison, and fined the maximum amount.

This shameful verdict fully exposes the heinous and ugly fascist face of the Truman reactionary government and its fear and trembling at its own impending doom. When the reactionary judge Medina announced this unjust verdict, he mobilized a large number of police and secret agents to be stationed inside and outside the court. The eleven CPUSA leaders were even taken away in handcuffs. What difference is there between such bloody and brutal methods and the actions of Hitler, Mussolini, and that gang of fascist ghosts? Is this not because the rule of the Truman reactionary government appears too fragile and isolated in the face of the powerful forces of the people and justice, so much so that it has to resort to bloody and brutal fascist means to maintain its increasingly precarious rule? The Truman reactionary government has so thoroughly discarded the tattered cloak of so-called "American-style democracy," which U.S. imperialism habitually boasts of to deceive the people at home and abroad, thereby making it clear to the people of the world that so-called "American-style democracy" is opposition to true democracy and opposition to the basic rights of the American people and the people of the world. This shows how desperately helpless the American reactionary government has become.

This reactionary verdict, on its contrary, precisely proves that the efforts made by the Communist Party of the United States in exposing the Truman reactionary government's preparations for a new war and in combating U.S. imperialist fascist rule have achieved great success and have been enthusiastically responded to by the American people and the people of the world, making the prestige and leading role of the Communist Party of the United States among the broad masses of the people grow more rapidly. Therefore, the Truman reactionary government did not have time to choose means and "sentenced" the eleven CPUSA leaders, launching a desperate and adventurous attack on the American workers' movement, American democratic freedom, and the world's peaceful democratic forces. However, since this attack is so adventurous, it is destined to fail in the end. Facts have already proven that during the nine-month process of "trial" of the eleven CPUSA leaders, the people of the world have shown the greatest concern. A fierce tide of protests and anger has surged throughout the Americas and the world. Telegrams condemning the bloody crimes of U.S. imperialism have poured in like snowflakes. The people of the world have expressed that their interests are linked to those of the American people and that they are closely related to the American people and the CPUSA leaders. This will inevitably make the people of the world and the American people further unite to fight together against the new war conspiracy of U.S. imperialism.

Currently, the movement of the American people to rescue the CPUSA leaders is growing across the country. The people of the world should rise up more bravely to support this movement and use the powerful force of the people to force the American reactionaries to suffer the consequences of their illegal and shameful "verdict"!

### 美国反动派必将自食其果

　　美国反动派必将自食其果
    众所周知，美国共产党是反对杜鲁门反动政府进行备战，保卫美国人民生活权利和民主自由的最坚强的战士。她为了美国人民的崇高利益，坚贞不屈地战斗了三十年。可是，现在，这些美国人民最优秀的儿女，工人阶级事业的忠诚和光荣的战士——十一位美共领袖，竟被美帝国主义纽约联邦法院诬告他们争取人民权利和自由为有罪，被非法地判处五年或三年徒刑，并科以最高限度的罚金。
    这一可耻的判决，充分暴露出杜鲁门反动政府穷凶极恶的法西斯丑恶面貌和对它自己死亡前途的恐惧与颤栗。在反动法官麦迪纳宣布这一违反正义的判决时，竟调动大批警察与特务分布在法庭内外，十一位美共领袖，竟被带上手铐，这样血腥残暴的手法，与希特勒、墨索里尼那一班法西斯死鬼们的所作所为难道还有什么差别吗？这难道还不是因为杜鲁门反动政府的统治，在强大人民力量和正义的面前，显得太脆弱太孤立了，以致不得不借血腥残暴的法西斯手段，来维持其日益摇摇欲坠的统治地位吗？杜鲁门反动政府把美帝国主义所惯常吹嘘的，用来欺骗国内外人民的所谓“美国式民主”的破烂外衣竟然如此彻底地丢弃在一边，从而使全世界人民看得明明白白，所谓“美国式民主”，就是反对真民主，反对美国人民及世界人民的基本权利，这也就可见美国反动政府已经沦落到怎样无可奈何的地步了。
    这个反动的判决，在其相反的方面，恰恰证明了美国共产党在揭露杜鲁门反动政府进行新战争准备和在打击美帝国主义法西斯统治的斗争中所做的努力，是获得了巨大的成绩，受到美国国内以及全世界人民的热烈响应，使美国共产党在广大人民中的威信和领导作用愈加迅速地增长起来，因而使杜鲁门反动政府来不及选择手段，就将十一位美共领袖“判刑”，对美国工人运动，美国民主自由和世界和平民主力量做了绝望的冒险进攻。但是，这个进攻既是这样的冒险，它就注定了一定要最后失败。事实已经证明：在“审讯”美共十一位领袖的九个月过程中，全世界人民都提起了最大的关心，全美洲和全世界激烈的抗议怒潮已经澎湃起来了，反对美帝国主义血腥罪行的文电如雪片飞来，全世界人民都表示了与美国人民的利益是联系在一起的，与美国人民和美共领袖是休戚相关的。这就必然使世界人民与美国人民更进一步地团结起来，共同为反对美帝国主义新战争阴谋而斗争。
    目前，美国人民为营救美共领袖的运动正在全国增长着，全世界人民应该更勇敢地起来，支援这一运动，用强大的人民力量迫使美国反动派自食其非法的可耻“判决”的后果！
