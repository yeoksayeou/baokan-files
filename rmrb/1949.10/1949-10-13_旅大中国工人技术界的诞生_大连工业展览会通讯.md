Professors and experts who visited the Dalian Industrial Exhibition were all delighted by the magnificent creativity of the Chinese working class in Lüda and the superiority of the Soviet Union's advanced technical experience. The entire exhibition tells us that once the heroic and hardworking Chinese people are combined with advanced technology, any industrial miracle can appear at their hands. However, for the workers of Lüda, the process of this combination was extremely tortuous.

Let's look at something as small as rivets!

An old riveter at the Sino-Soviet Railway always had oil tankers leak after he riveted them. A Soviet technician told him: this is because the weather is cold, and the temperature of the tank body is too low, so the rivets suddenly contract when cooled, causing leaks; the temperature of the tank body should be raised with hot air first. But the old riveter said: "The Japanese ran the railway for forty years, even if they didn't do a good job, they couldn't have done worse than you. When did the Japanese ever do it this way?" The Soviet technician patiently explained it more than ten times, but he stubbornly followed the old method more than ten times, until oil tankers with a load of fifty tons were riveted badly, and only then did he begin to consider this most obvious truth. The ideological poison of blindly worshipping capitalism was thus deeply imprinted in the minds of workers like the old riveter, damaging the workers' confidence in their own labor and creation. Only the Soviet friends who sincerely helped rebuild the industry of Lüda would use all kinds of methods to cultivate the Chinese worker brothers' ability to manage their own country's property. Even in complex technical departments such as the electrical communication department of Dalian Port, the "nerve center of the port," which was previously controlled by three hundred Japanese technicians, all the work can now be completely undertaken by the one hundred and fifty Chinese laborers who were there at the time.

Take the large-scale railway factory as another example. After a large number of Japanese nationals were sent back to their country, the number of employees was reduced by almost half, and none of the remaining Chinese workers knew how to manage a workshop or a section. Soviet friends unhesitatingly promoted a large number of Chinese workers to leadership positions and universally established deputy factory directors with positions and powers; in order to train the management skills of the Chinese worker brothers in joint work, some deputy factory directors even numbered as many as three. Secondly, seventeen vocational technical night schools for employees were opened. The workers produced what they learned at night. The teachers of the technical night school answered the difficulties encountered by the employees in their work on the one hand; on the other hand, they taught basic knowledge such as arithmetic. Third, apprentices were cultivated in large numbers by signing contracts. Masters and apprentices voluntarily combined, and the teaching progress to be jointly observed was stipulated in the contract. If the results exceeded the plan, the master could get progressive "teaching wages," and the apprentice could also enjoy worker treatment according to the technical improvement. Fourth, youth technical schools were opened to train a large number of workers' children and outstanding youths for a long time. The factory paid the study wages to maintain their personal lives. Old technical workers who were in great demand in the factory were transferred to serve as internship teachers. Soviet chief engineers and educational technicians regularly guided the study and compiled and distributed teaching materials. This school with eleven practice workshops is the epitome of the railway factory. Students who have studied for one year can at least become technical workers in the factory. Facts have proved that this is a good way to train industrial cadres in large numbers. In just one year and one month, more than nine hundred and forty people have become ten different types of technical workers. And deputy factory directors such as electrical, lathe, fitter, boiler, and foundry workers can also undertake more independent work. However, without a long-term vision and firm determination, this training plan would be difficult to achieve.

When production in Lüda was far from recovering, there was a lack of technical personnel everywhere, and it was difficult for wages to maintain the workers' lives, yet money and cadres were used to run schools and training courses, which was difficult for people at the time who regarded wages as "relief money" to understand. Sino-Soviet enterprises have always adhered to a principle: workers' lives can only be truly improved in the development of production, and the training of cadres is indispensable at any time. Despite not being able to pay more wages for a while, the training expenses are still calculated into the cost. Not only does the enterprise's plan specifically list an "personnel training fee" in the cost, but the factory's planned costs for "general expenses" and "subsidized wages" also include the same purpose. The management system of Sino-Soviet enterprises also widely encourages technical learning. For example, under the seven-level wage system with a large difference, increasing one level of technology will increase the salary by more than 20%, and the salary of the seventh level is 320% of the first level. Another example is the "progressive bonus wage system," which stipulates that when the output exceeds 35%, the cumulative bonus rate is only 40%, but when it exceeds 75%, the cumulative bonus rate increases to 100%. Because the former can generally be achieved by labor intensity, the latter is difficult to achieve without significant technical improvements. After a textile factory implemented the seven-level wage system, the female workers who were originally satisfied with managing two machines demanded to manage six. Technology here is a common sign of national production development and the improvement of workers' lives.

"Rationalization proposals" are one of the main features of Soviet factory management methods. Visiting the industrial exhibition, one can see that the Sino-Soviet joint venture Far East Electric Industry Glass Factory completed its one-year task in half a year, which is inseparable from a rationalization proposal. The large kiln for melting glass raw materials is constantly eroded by the high-heat flowing solution, and the kiln bricks in contact with the horizontal plane are particularly severely worn. Within a year, a deep groove that almost penetrated the kiln bricks was eroded. Therefore, the Japanese spent 70 days every year for major demolition and repairs in the 21 years since the factory was built. However, labor hero Liu Maoyou came up with a way to lower the glass solution, so that the deep groove would no longer be eroded continuously. This is not an invention, nor is it a remarkable creation, but it has extended the life of the large kiln by seven months, which has increased a lot of national wealth.

Mobilizing the workers who are most familiar with every detail of the production process to find ways to improve tools, improve labor organization, and change unreasonable phenomena in production, this kind of suggestion is more capable of universally mobilizing workers to study technology than the invention and creation movement. In order to carry out this movement on a large scale, the railway factory will form a "rationalization proposal committee" composed of the Chinese chief engineer, the Chinese deputy factory director, and two technicians, responsible for researching, helping, and promoting applicable suggestions, and award bonuses of up to 200,000 yuan based on their contribution to production. At the same time, according to the factory's situation and needs, "technical rewards" are proposed, such as "those who can change the manual sand molding machine in the foundry to electric power will be rewarded with 1,000 to 5,000 yuan," etc., to inspire workers to use their brains.

As a result of the widespread rationalization proposals in the Lüda area in the past three years, last year alone created a value of 60,000 yuan in Guandong currency, which is equivalent to 15% of the total value of production in the same year. Among them, there are 449 creations that mark significant technological improvements. Repeatedly inspiring workers' labor creation in production, systematically training technical personnel in large numbers, and implementing various management systems that encourage technical creation, this only opens the door to technology. Without hard work and research, one still cannot master the technology. The young driver Liang Qixiang hated Japan, admired the Soviet Union, and was enthusiastic about political studies, but failed the technical course. Later, he realized that China cannot achieve socialism at present because its industry is too backward, and then he realized how significant "technology" should be. Since then, he has studied technology diligently, and his exam results have been above 80 points. He learned to drive within half a year. But he still studied hard, asking Soviet technicians and old drivers, and reading technical books until late at night when he returned home from work. Under such hard work, he finally created the highest traction record of 2,600 tons in just two years. His technology is so proficient that he can confidently tow a train of ninety-nine cars even when going uphill. This 22-year-old youth from a fishing family, with only two years of work experience, became a labor hero in the entire Lüda area.

How are the awakened workers in the Lüda area learning technology? Illiterate workers learn addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division in two months; workers who have attended school for a few years learn minor algebra in three months. In order to master cultural technology, they would rather have their hair burned yellow and their teeth eroded by oxygen than learn to operate machines. This is not a miracle, but a heroic act of risking one's life. The workers of the steel factory pointed to the miniature model of the rolling mill factory in the exhibition and said: "The Japanese laughed at us for wanting to build a rolling mill. They said: 'We have to come up with a five-year plan to build a rolling mill.' Our workers figured out how to make models, cast sand, install... if it's broken, we do it again, if it doesn't work, we do it again. At that time, the Japanese stood far away, laughing, watching us fail. But in less than a year, we succeeded!" Now, hundreds of new factory directors, tens of thousands of new technical talents, those technical knowledge circles who have been cultivated from workers in the past three years, have mastered the technology that was completely monopolized by the Japanese in the past, such as shipbuilding, railway, machinery, refineries, chemical and other industries, in the hands of Chinese workers. For example, the director of a large shipyard with more than 1,000 workers and thirteen workshops is now a dock worker from four years ago. Although he handles more than ten different businesses every day and accepts emergency strike work that is often urgent, he is organized, meticulous, and accurate in completing the plan without exception, like a Soviet engineer. This achievement is indeed amazing. But he always said: "I can't do anything, just rely on a key, that is 'learning from the Soviet Union'!" Indeed, the newly born Lüda worker technical knowledge circle does not yet have a senior technical expert today, and is only taking the first step towards the door of technology. However, this step is enough to tell us: whoever is good at learning will walk faster.

　　旅大中国工人技术界的诞生
    大连工业展览会通讯
    华山
    参观过大连工业展览会的教授和专家，都惊欢着旅大中国工人阶级的雄伟创造力和苏联先进技术经验的优越性。整个展览会告诉我们：当英勇勤劳的中国人民一旦与先进技术结合起来，什么工业奇迹都会在他们手下出现的。可是，对于旅大工人来说，这个结合的过程是十二分曲折的。
    且看象铆钉那末小的事情吧！
    中长铁路局一个老铆工，第一次铆的运油罐总是漏水。苏联技师告诉他：这是因为天气冷，罐体温度过低，因此铆钉骤然受冷收缩，漏缝了；应该先用热气把罐体温度提高。但老铆工却说：“日本人办铁路好歹办了四十年，办不好也不能比你办坏了。什么时候是日本人这样干过？”苏联技师耐心解释了十几次，他也照老办法蛮干了十几次，直到载重五十吨的油罐都铆坏了，他才开始考虑这个最明显不过的道理。盲目崇拜资本主义的思想毒害，就是这样深刻地印在老铆工这样的工人的脑子里，伤害了工人们劳动创造的自信心。只有赤诚帮助重建旅大工业的苏联友人，才会用尽种种办法，培养着中国工人兄弟管理自己祖国财产的才能。即如象大连码头电气通讯部那样复杂的技术部门，过去由三百名日本技术人员操纵着的“海港神经中枢”，现在全部工作都可由当时的一百五十名中国杂役完全负担了。
    再以规模宏大的铁路工厂为例，大批遣送日侨回国以后，职工人数几乎减少一半，剩下的中国工人没有人会管理一个工场或车间。苏联友人毫不犹疑地把大批中国工人提拔到领导岗位上来，普遍设立有职有权的副厂长；为了在共同工作中锻炼中国工人兄弟的管理才能，有的副厂长竟达三人之多。第二，又开办了十七个职工业余的技术夜校。工人们白天在工厂里生产什么，晚上就学习什么。技术夜校教员一方面解答职工们工作中所碰到的困难；另一方面讲授算术等基本知识。第三，用订立合同的办法，大批培养学徒，师徒自愿结合，在合同中规定共同遵守的教学进度，如果成绩超过计划，师傅可以得到累进的“教徒工资”，学徒也可以按技术提高情形享受工人待遇。第四、开办青年技术学校，长期培养大批工人子弟和优秀青年。由工厂发给维持个人生活的学习工资。抽调工厂中极感缺乏的老技术工人担任实习教员。苏联总工程师和教育技师则经常指导学习并编发教材。这个拥有十一个实习工场的学校，就是铁路工厂的缩影。学习过一年的学生最少可以成为工厂的技术工人。事实证明：这是大批培养工业干部的好办法，仅只一年零一个月的时间，就有九百四十多个人成为十一种不同的技术工人。而如电气、镟盘、钳工、锅炉、翻砂等副厂长们，也能担负起更多的独立工作。可是，如果没有远大的眼光和坚定的魄力，这种培养计划是很难实现的。
    当旅大生产远未恢复，到处缺乏技术人材，工资很难维持工人生活的时候，却拿钱和干部来办学校、训练班，对于当时把工资当做“救济金”的人们说来，是难以理解的。中苏企业却始终坚持一个原则：工人生活只能在发展生产中求得真正的改善，干部的培养却是任何时候都不可缺少的。尽管一时不能支付更多工资，仍然把培养经费计算在成本里面。不但企业的计划在成本中专列一项“人事养成费”，就是工厂的计划成本中的“一般经费”和“补助工薪费”，也包括着同样的用途。中苏企业的管理制度，也是广泛地鼓舞技术学习的。例如，在差额很大的七级工资制度下技术提高一级，工资即增加百分之二十以上，第七级的工资则为第一级的百分之三百二十。又如“超额累进奖薪制”中规定：当产量超过了百分之三十五时，累奖率只是百分之四十，可是超过百分之七十五时，累奖率即增至百分之百。因为前者一般是可以用劳动强度来争取的，后者则没有技术的显著改进，就很难达到。一个纺织厂实行七级工资制以后，本来满足于管理两台机器的女工都要求管理六台了。技术在这里是国家生产发展和工人生活改善的共同标志。
    “生产合理化建议”是苏联工厂管理方法的主要特点之一。参观工业展览会可以看到：中苏合营的远东电业玻璃工厂半年完成一年任务，是和一项合理化建议分不开的。熔化玻璃原料的大窑，由于高热的流动溶液不断侵蚀，和水平面接触的窑砖耗损特别厉害，一年之内即被蚀出一道几乎穿透窑砖的深沟。所以日本人建厂二十一年，每年都花七十天的时间大拆大修一次。但是劳动英雄刘茂有想出降低玻璃溶液的办法，使深沟不再继续被蚀。这不是什么发明，也不是了不起的创造，但却使大窑寿命延长了七个月，该增加了多少国家财富。
    把最熟悉生产过程每个细节的工人发动起来，想办法改进工具，改进劳动组织和改变生产中不合理的现象，这种建议比起发明创造运动来，是更能普遍发动工人钻研技术的。铁路工厂为了大规模展开这一运动，将由中国总工程师、中国副厂长和两个技师组成“合理化建议委员会”，负责研究帮助和推广适用的建议，并按着它对生产的贡献，奖给二十万元以下的奖金。同时，根据工厂的情况和需要，提出“技术悬赏”，如“能把翻砂厂的人力翻砂机改为电力的，奖一千到五千元”等，启发工人开动脑筋。
    三年来旅大地区普遍展开合理化建议的结果，仅是去年一年就创造了关东币六万万元的价值，等于同年生产总值的百分之十五。其中标志着技术显著提高的创造，即有四百四十九件。在生产中反覆启发工人的劳动创造，有计划的大批培养技术人材，实行多种鼓励技术创造的管理制度，这只是打开了技术的大门。没有刻苦奋斗的钻研，还是掌握不了技术的。青年司机梁启祥，痛恨日本，羡慕苏联，热衷政治学习，技术课却考不及格。以后他知道中国目前不能实现社会主义，是因为工业太落后了，这才了解到“技术”这东西该有多大意义。从此，他用心学习技术，考试成绩都在八十分以上，半年内就学会开车。可是他还是苦心钻研着，问苏联技师，问老司机们，下工回家还看技术书籍到深夜。他在这样的苦心钻研下，终于在短短的两年中创造了二千六百吨的最高牵引纪录。他的技术熟练到如此程度，以至在上坡时也能有把握牵引九十九个车箱的列车。这个渔民出身的二十二岁青年，仅仅只有两年工龄，便成为旅大全区的劳动英雄。
    旅大地区觉悟了的工人们，是在怎样地学习技术呢？不识字的工人，两个月内学会加减乘除；上过几年学的工人，在三个月内学会小代数。为了掌握文化技术，宁肯被酸素烧黄头发和蚀掉牙齿，也要学会操纵机器。这不是什么奇迹，而是奋不顾身的英雄行为。钢铁工厂的工人指着展览会里的压延工厂缩型说：“日本人笑话我们想造压延机。他们说：‘我们建设一个压延机，也还得来个五年计划’。我们工人自己捉摸着做模型，翻砂，按装……坏了重来，不行再干。那时候日本人远远站着，笑着，看我们失败。可是，不到一年，我们就成功了！”现在，成百的新厂长，上万的新技术人材，那些过去三年来从工人中培养出来的技术知识界，把过去完全被日本人垄断的技术，如造船、铁路、机械、炼厂、化学等工业，都掌握到中国工人手里了。比方拥有一千多工人和十三个工场的大修船厂，现在的厂长就是四年前的码头工人。他每天虽然处理着十几种不同的业务，接受着经常是紧急的突击工作，但他象一个苏联工程师那样，有条不紊，精细周密，无例外地准确完成计划。这种成绩的确是惊人的。可是他总是说：“我什么都不行，就凭一把钥匙，那就是‘学习苏联’！”的确，刚刚诞生的旅大工人技术知识界，今天还没有一个高级的技术专家，今天还仅只是向技术的大门迈着第一步。不过这一步已经够告诉我们：谁善于学习谁就走得快些。
