Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 6th: Warsaw dispatch from the Polish News Agency: Berlin dispatch: Thousands of people from the Soviet and British occupied zones of Germany participated in the International Peace Day gathering held in Lüneburg, on the border of the two zones. Albin, Chairman of the Communist Party of Germany in Schleswig-Holstein, and Kran, Chairman of the League of Victims of Hitlerism, issued a joint declaration. Bürger, a member of the German People's Council, declared: We are anti-imperialists because the imperialist government endangers the freedom and independence of the people and threatens peace.

On October 2nd, representatives of German and Polish workers gathered in East Frankfurt on the Oder River and held a demonstration to establish friendly relations between the German and Polish people. Two obelisks were erected at the German border exit on the Oder River Bridge, decorated with the black, red, and gold flag and the Polish flag, with the words, "Welcome builders of People's Poland" written on them. Many delegations from Berlin and the Soviet-occupied states arrived one after another, and Soviet Commander Kozlov of East Frankfurt also attended the ceremony. When the Polish delegation arrived, they were warmly received. To the tune of the Internationale, a procession of 20,000 people marched along the crowded streets towards the City Hall. A conference was held in the City Hall, where Herbert Warnke, Chairman of the Free German Trade Union Federation, spoke, stating: Germany has twice plunged the world into the abyss of war in recent decades. The German people have twice allowed themselves to be used to seek the interests of small cliques. Now they must learn a lesson, not allow Hitler's crimes to happen again, and never forget that new wars will take place on German territory. Biwowarska, Secretary of the Central Council of Polish Trade Unions, paid tribute to the representatives of the new Germany and asked them to inherit the noble traditions of Marx, Engels, and Liebknecht. The meeting passed a resolution condemning the imperialist warmongers and German chauvinists, and stating: We stand in the ranks of the world's peace fighters led by the Soviet Union, and believe that the Oder-Neisse border is a border of peace. We guarantee that we will always maintain friendly relations with our Polish neighbors.
