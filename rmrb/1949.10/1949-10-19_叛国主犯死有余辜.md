　　Arch-Traitor Deserves to Die
After the National Committee of the Hungarian People's Court rejected all appeals, the three principal culprits in the Rajk treason case were executed on the 15th. This is the final and shameful defeat of the great conspiracy of American and British imperialism and the Tito rebel group in Hungary. These principal traitors deserved to die.
　　Rajk and other treasonous criminals were arrested by the Hungarian National Security Agency in June of this year. After a detailed investigation by the Hungarian National Prosecutor's Office, a public prosecution was filed with the People's Court in mid-September, and a week-long public trial was conducted. The Special Committee of the People's Court announced the death sentence for the three principal culprits, Rajk, Szőnyi, and Szalai, on September 24th. During the trial, it was fully confirmed that Rajk and others were employed by the spy agencies of American imperialism and the Yugoslav Tito rebel group, engaging in a long-term betrayal of the people's democratic motherland, with the aim of allowing the Tito group to control Hungary, thereby restoring the brutal rule of imperialism in Hungary. Therefore, Rajk and others were sentenced to death entirely deservedly. This is not only to defend the great achievements of the Hungarian people's democratic system but also a significant contribution to the world people's struggle to defend peace and democracy. This proves that traitors who betray the people's motherland are bound to be punished by the people.
　　Although the Rajk treason conspiracy has suffered a shameful defeat, all freedom-loving people around the world must continue to raise their revolutionary vigilance because dying imperialism and its running dogs will not voluntarily abandon their sabotage activities. They will inevitably continue to struggle frantically, using all kinds of despicable methods to attack the peace and democracy camp. Only by bringing out greater strength to shatter all possible conspiracies and poisonous schemes of imperialism to provoke war can we defend lasting peace and the cause of people's democracy.

　　叛国主犯死有余辜
    匈牙利人民法庭国家委员会驳回了一切上诉之后，拉伊克等叛国案的三个主犯，已于十五日被处以死刑。这是美英帝国主义及铁托叛逆集团在匈牙利的大阴谋的最后可耻失败。这些叛国的主犯是死有余辜的。
    拉伊克等叛国罪犯，系于本年六月为匈牙利国家保安机关所逮捕，经过匈牙利国家检察署详尽调查，于九月中旬向人民法庭提起公诉，并进行为时一周的公开审判，人民法庭专门委员会于九月二十四日宣布对拉伊克、佐恩尼、萨莱等三主犯判处死刑。在审讯过程中，完全证实拉伊克等是受美帝国主义及南斯拉夫铁托叛逆集团的间谍机关所雇用，长期进行叛卖人民民主祖国，其目的在使铁托集团控制匈牙利，从而恢复帝国主义在匈牙利的强暴统治。因此，拉伊克等犯被处以死刑，完全是罪有应得的，这不仅是为了保卫匈牙利人民民主制度的伟大成果，而且是对世界人民保卫和平民主斗争的一个重大的贡献。这证明了叛卖人民祖国的奸徒是一定要受到人民的惩罚的。
    拉伊克等叛国阴谋案虽然遭到可耻的失败，但全世界一切爱好自由的人民，必须继续提高其革命警惕性，因为垂死的帝国主义及其走卒们，是不会自行放弃其阴谋破坏活动的，它们必然还要进行疯狂的挣扎，用各种卑劣的方法来进攻和平民主阵营。我们只有拿出更大的力量来，粉碎帝国主义挑拨战争的一切可能的阴谋毒计，才能保卫持久和平与人民民主事业。
