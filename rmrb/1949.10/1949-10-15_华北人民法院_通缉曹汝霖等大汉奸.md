North China People's Court

　　Issues Arrest Warrant for Major Traitors Like Cao Rulin

　　[This newspaper reports] The traitors Cao Rulin, Fu Shuangying, and the secret agents Wu Taixun and Wu Jiyu, among others, committed numerous evils. Before the liberation of Beijing, they all fled in fear of punishment. The North China People's Court hereby issues an arrest warrant to bring them to justice and will first confiscate all their property. Cao Rulin is an old-brand traitor. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he served as a major traitor, holding positions such as Chairman of the Puppet North China Political Affairs Commission, Chairman of the East Asia Economic Roundtable Conference, and Director of the Xinmin Printing House, betraying the country and harming the people. After the surrender of the Japanese invaders, the former Kuomintang government allowed him to go unpunished. Fu Shuangying participated in the puppet Nanjing government of Wang Jingwei, serving as Director of the Political Training Department, Executive Vice Minister, Chief of Staff of the Training Directorate, and Vice President of the Military Advisory Council. The former Kuomintang government declared this type of major traitor innocent. Wu Taixun participated in Chiang Kai-shek's military intelligence bureau in Hong Kong after the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, serving as a secret agent. Later, he was entrusted by the Japanese military police commander in Beijing to collect materials for the enemy to supply their military needs, and he harmed the people by relying on the enemy's power. After the surrender of the Japanese invaders, he continued his secret agent activities. Wu Jiyu was a secret agent of Chiang Kai-shek's military intelligence bureau, serving as a design committee member and an important accomplice of Dai Li, the head of the Kuomintang secret service.

　　华北人民法院
    通缉曹汝霖等大汉奸
    【本报讯】汉奸曹汝霖、富双英及奸特吴泰勋、吴季玉等四人，做恶多端，北京解放前均畏罪潜逃，华北人民法院特予通缉归案法办，并先行没收其所有财产。按曹汝霖为老牌卖国贼，抗战爆发后，充当大汉奸，担任伪华北政务委员会会长、东亚经济恳谈会会长、新民印书馆理事长等职务，出卖国家，为害人民。日寇投降后，前国民党政府任其逍遥法外，不加惩办。富双英曾参加汪逆精卫之伪南京政府，担任政治训练部厅长、常务次长、编练总监署参谋长、军事参议院副院长等职务。前国民党政府对此等大汉奸竟宣告无罪。吴泰勋抗战爆发后，曾在香港参加蒋匪军统局，充当特务，后来北京日军宪兵司令嘱托，代敌搜集物资，供敌军需，并依仗敌势，祸害人民。日寇投降后，仍继续特务活动。吴季玉为蒋匪军统局特务，曾充设计委员，是国特头子戴笠之重要帮凶。
