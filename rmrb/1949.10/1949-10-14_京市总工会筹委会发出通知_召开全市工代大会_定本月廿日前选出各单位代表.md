The notice explained that this is the city's first Workers' Congress, and the main tasks of the congress are: to review and approve the summary report of the work of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee over the past eight months; to determine the guiding principles and tasks for the city's trade union work in the future based on the instructions of the National Trade Union Work Conference and the specific conditions of the city; to adopt the organizational charter of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and, in accordance with this charter, elect members of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and establish the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions.

The number of representatives allocated by the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee based on the current number of trade union members and the status of trade union work is as follows: The total number of official representatives for the city is set at 365, including 183 representatives of industrial workers in public and private enterprises, 44 representatives of handicraft workers, 36 representatives of shop employees, 54 representatives of transport workers, 12 representatives of cultural and educational workers, 2 representatives of staff and worker schools, 2 representatives of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee, and 32 representatives of railway workers.

Regarding the election and review of representatives, the notice stated: (1) Each trade union or trade union preparatory committee should, where possible, convene a membership meeting and elect representatives by means of equal, secret ballot of all trade union members.

(2) Candidates may be nominated by the trade union committee or the trade union representative meeting, or they may be nominated jointly by five members. Both of the above candidate lists must be approved at the election meeting. The number of candidates should preferably exceed the number of elected persons by a factor of one. When nominating candidates, each unit should pay appropriate attention to the proportion of female and young workers among the representatives. During the election, candidates may put forward their own views and openly campaign. When trade union members vote, they may vote according to the list of candidates, but members who do not wish to elect from the list of candidates may also elect other members they wish to elect. However, the total number of those elected must not exceed the legal quota, and any exceeding that will be counted as invalid votes.

(4) The leadership of the election work of each trade union shall be the responsibility of the committee of that trade union. (5) When leading the election, the committee of each trade union must pay attention to the following matters: (1) Accurately investigate the number of members in the unit before the election, and the number of people actually participating in the election. (2) Announce the list of candidates, and have the trade union or candidates report on their work history. (3) When holding membership meetings or membership representative meetings or joint meetings of group leaders to vote, attention should be paid to checking and correcting behaviors that violate the election law. (4) The elected representatives should collect the opinions of the members on the work of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee and proposals for future work to bring to the congress. (6) Regarding the review of representatives, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee shall organize a representative qualification review committee (this committee may absorb people who are familiar with the situation of various trade unions to participate), and after the official representatives and alternate representatives are elected, the committee shall conduct the representative review work, and submit the review results to the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee for approval.
