　　To Greet the October Revolution Festival
    Moscow Workers' Emulation Drive Will Complete This Year's Plan Ahead of Schedule
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 9th] TASS reported: 96 percent of all workers, engineers, technicians, and staff in Moscow enterprises have joined the socialist emulation drive to commemorate the 32nd anniversary of the October Revolution. They are striving to complete this year's plan ahead of November 7th and strive to complete the Five-Year Plan in industrial output this year. The feature of the pre-festival emulation is the further increase in creative initiatives put forward by the working people regarding accelerating the speed of production. The movement for producing high-quality finished products and saving raw materials is being widely promoted. In ten departments of Moscow industry, a total of nine thousand work teams are all manufacturing exquisitely crafted finished products.
    In the movement to strive for accelerated production, a new upsurge can be seen. In the "Red Proletarian" machine tool factory, 300 workers are using the metal cutting acceleration method. In the "Vladimir Ilyich" machine factory, several work teams have been formed in each department, all using the acceleration method. The work completed by the factory's first-class acceleration competitor, machine operator Alexander Smirnov, has exceeded the target of fifteen years.
    Collective Stakhanovite work has also greatly increased. All the workers in the twelve Stakhanovite work departments of the "Caliber" tool factory have exceeded their targets. All the personnel of the factory guarantee to make their factory worthy of being called a Stakhanovite factory before the 32nd anniversary of the October Revolution.
    The workers of the "Paris Commune" shoe factory have exceeded the shoe production tasks stipulated in the plan. Taking September as an example, they exceeded the plan and produced an additional 10,000 pairs of children's shoes.
    Hundreds of Moscow enterprises have completed their respective departments' Five-Year Plans ahead of schedule. In the course of eight months, Moscow industry has saved 450 million rubles by accelerating the turnover of working capital.
