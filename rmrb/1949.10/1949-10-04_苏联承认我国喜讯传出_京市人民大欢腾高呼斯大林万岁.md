　　The Good News of Soviet Recognition Reaches Us
　　The People of Beijing Rejoice and Shout "Long Live Stalin!"
　　[Our Newspaper] After more than two hundred cadres in the twelve districts of Beijing heard the news that the Soviet Union was the first to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China at the celebration party for the establishment of the Central People's Government, the crowd was in a frenzy, and the cheers lasted for ten minutes. After the meeting, everyone gathered around the radio to listen to the Xinhua Broadcasting Station's third news broadcast. After listening to the notes exchanged between Minister Zhou Enlai and Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko, everyone automatically began to discuss. Some said, "I expected long ago that the Soviet Union would be the first to recognize us." Another added, "Marshal Stalin has never forgotten the revolutionary struggle of the Chinese people." Another said, "Just wait and see, the notes from the brother countries in Southeastern Europe and Democratic North Korea will arrive soon."
　　Tonight, in the Fifth Inner District, after more than three thousand soldiers and civilians heard this news at the celebration party, the crowd immediately erupted. People shouted slogans like "Long Live Stalin," "Long Live Mao Zedong," and "Long Live the Central People's Government" with unparalleled excitement and fervent enthusiasm, the sounds rising and falling one after another, lasting for a long time.

　　[Our Newspaper] After the students of Normal University heard the news that the Soviet Union had established diplomatic relations with us, the students who had already gone to bed and were preparing to sleep became active again, some rolling around on the bed without dressing properly, waving their arms and stamping their feet. Professors and students of Tsinghua University were holding a symposium to summarize the experience of this celebration. After hearing the news, everyone hugged each other and shouted, "Long Live Stalin!" "Long Live Chairman Mao!" "Long Live World Lasting Peace!" Everyone couldn't help but discuss in groups of three or five, and received further internationalist education on this issue. Some students pointed out: "The Soviet Union was the first to abolish unequal treaties; the Soviet Union was the first to support the Chinese people during the Anti-Japanese War; and now the Soviet Union is also the first to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. From this, we recognize the true meaning of Chairman Mao telling us to ‘lean to one side.’" In the sound of the national anthem, students and professors shouted: "World peace is guaranteed!" Students from China University and Fu Jen University were so excited after hearing the news that they forgot the fatigue of the day and wanted to go to the streets to perform the Yangko dance. Not a single student or professor who heard the news was not overjoyed. They had more confidence in guaranteeing world peace.

　　苏联承认我国喜讯传出
   　京市人民大欢腾高呼斯大林万岁
    【本报讯】京市十二区二百多干部在庆祝中央人民政府成立联欢晚会上听到苏联首先与中华人民共和国建立外交关系的消息后，群情沸腾，欢呼之声达十分钟之久。会散以后，大家就围在收音机前面收听新华广播电台的第三次新闻。当听完周恩来部长和苏联外交部副部长葛罗米柯相互交换的照会以后，大家都自动地讨论起来，有的说：“我早就料到，苏联是会首先承认我们的。”又一个接着说：“斯大林大元帅从来就没有忘记过中国人民的革命斗争。”又一个说：“等着瞧吧，东南欧的兄弟国家和民主北朝鲜的照会，马上就会到来了。”
    内五区今晚在三千多人的军民联欢晚会上突然听到了这一消息后，人群立刻沸腾起来，人们以无比地兴奋尽情狂热地欢呼着“斯大林万岁”“毛泽东万岁”“中央人民政府万岁”的口号，声浪彼伏此起，经久不息。

    【本报讯】师大同学听到苏联与我建立外交关系的消息以后，已经睡了觉和正准备睡觉的同学们又活跃起来，有的没有穿好衣服便在床上乱滚，手舞足蹈。清华大学的教授和同学们正在一起开总结这次庆祝会经验的座谈会，听到这个消息以后，大家互相拥抱，狂呼：“斯大林万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”“世界持久和平万岁！”大家不由得三五成群展开了讨论，在这样一个问题上又得到了进一步的国际主义的教育，有的同学提出说：“废除不平等条约，苏联是第一个；在抗日时期支援中国人民的，苏联是第一个；现在与中华人民共和国建立外交关系，苏联也是第一个。从这里认识到毛主席告诉我们‘一边倒’的真义。”在国歌声中同学教授们高呼：“世界和平有了保障！”华大、辅大的同学听到这个消息兴奋得忘记了一天的疲劳还要到街上去扭秧歌。听到这个消息的同学教授们没有一个不欢欣鼓舞。他们对世界和平的保障更有了信心。
