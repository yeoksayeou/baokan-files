　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 5th: TASS, Chicago, 3rd—The All-America Labor Conference for Peace, convened on the suggestion of several labor unions in Illinois and Ohio, has opened in Chicago. Despite obstruction by the right-wing leaders of the CIO and AFL, over 1,200 labor union representatives from across various industries attended the conference. Prominent American progressives participated in the work of the conference, including Progressive Party leader Wallace, Paul Robeson, and New York State Assemblyman Marcantonio of the American Labor Party. The U.S. State Department refused to issue entry visas to prominent labor union leaders from other countries who were invited to attend the conference, including Toledano, Chairman of the Latin American Labor Federation, and Quatpont, a representative of the French General Confederation of Labor, who were therefore unable to attend. The conference was opened by Garey, a leader of the Chicago Food Workers Union. When Garey said that the conference must lay the foundation for the organized struggle of American workers to support peace and oppose instigators of a new war, the audience responded with a storm of applause.

　　Several representatives from local branches of the CIO, AFL, and independent unions spoke at the conference. They criticized the reactionary policies of the U.S. government and the open betrayal of the working class interests by the reactionary leading bodies of the CIO and AFL; demanded the abolition of the aggressive Atlantic Pact, the cessation of arms supplies to Western Europe, the cessation of the “Cold War” against the Soviet Union, and peaceful cooperation with the Soviet Union.

　　Grant, Chairman of the Detroit Automobile Workers Union, delivered a long speech, urging American workers to participate in the peace and democracy struggle being waged by the people of other countries, first by trying to stop the Cold War against the Soviet Union, and striving to transform the United Nations into an “instrument of peace and international cooperation” in accordance with the goals and tasks set forth when the United Nations was established. Grant pointed out that a crisis is developing in the United States, war hysteria is being artificially incited, the people's civil rights and trade union rights are being trampled upon, the reactionary leaders of the CIO and AFL are betraying the interests of the working class and openly defending war plans. Grant concluded by saying that the All-America Labor Conference for Peace is of great historical significance to the American people. It has produced a powerful and organized workers' peace movement, the scale and strength of which will continue to grow until the goal of peace based on Soviet-American friendship is achieved.

　　New York labor union representative and prominent progressive Moorhead was warmly welcomed by the representatives when she appeared on the podium. She spoke of the impression the International Women's Congress held in Budapest last December made on her, as she had attended the congress as a member of the American women's delegation. Moorhead called on American women to participate in the struggle for peace waged by women around the world and to oppose American warmongers.

　　After the plenary session, the various committees of the conference began their work, establishing a permanent body for the American Labor Conference for Peace and drafting a program of action for the conference, as well as resolutions on opposing the Cold War and on workers' joint action to defend civil rights, to be submitted to the next conference for adoption.

　　全美职工会和平大会
    强烈抨击美帝制造战争阴谋号召加强斗争制止对苏冷战
    【新华社北京五日电】塔斯社芝加哥三日讯：根据伊利诺斯州和俄亥俄州若干职工会的建议而召开的全美职工会拥护和平大会，已在芝加哥揭幕。虽然有产联与劳联右翼领袖的阻扰，但仍有代表各业工会的全美职工代表一千二百余人参加会议。参加会议工作的并有美国著名进步人士，其中有进步党领袖华莱士、保罗·罗伯逊、美国劳工党纽约州议员马肯托尼奥等人。美国务院拒发入境签证给被邀请出席会议的其他国家的著名职工会领袖，拉丁美洲劳工联合会主席托列达诺及法国总工会代表夸特庞特等，因而没有能到美国出席会议。会议由芝加哥食品工人工会领袖加芮揭幕。在加芮说到大会必须为美国工人拥护和平反对新战争挑拨者的有组织斗争奠定基础时，会场报以暴风雨似的掌声。
    产联、劳联及独立工会的地方分会的若干代表，都在会上发表演说。他们抨击美国政府的反动政策及产联与劳联反动领导机构的公开出卖工人阶级利益；要求废除侵略性的大西洋公约，停止以军备供应西欧，停止对苏“冷战”，并与苏联和平合作。
    底特律汽车工人工会主席格兰特发表长篇演说，敦促美国工人参加世界其他国家人民进行的和平民主斗争，首先设法制止对苏冷战，并力求按照创设联合国时设定的目标与任务，变联合国为“和平与国际合作的工具”。格兰特指出：在美国危机正在发展，战争歇斯底里正被人为地煽动起来，人民的民权与职工会权利正被蹂躏，产联与劳联的反动领袖出卖工人阶级的利益，并且公开地为战争计划辩护。格兰特结语说：全美职工会拥护和平大会对于美国人民有巨大的历史意义。它产生了强大而有组织的工人的拥护和平运动，这一运动的规模和力量将日益增长，直到以苏美友好为基础的和平目标达到时为止。
    纽约职员工会代表与著名进步人士慕尔亥德出现在讲台上时，受到代表们的热烈欢迎。她谈到去年十二月在布达佩斯举行的国际妇女代表大会给她的印象，她曾以美国妇女代表团团员的资格参加大会。慕尔亥德号召美国妇女参加世界各地妇女进行的拥护和平的斗争，反对美国战争贩子。
    全体大会结束后，大会各委员会即开始各项工作，建立美国职工会拥护和平会议的常设机构与起草会议的行动纲领，以及关于反对冷战、工人共同行动保卫民权的决议，以便交下次大会通过。
