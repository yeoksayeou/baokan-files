Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 24th - TASS, Prague: The Czechoslovak Foreign Ministry, regarding the espionage and subversive activities conducted by officials of the US Embassy in Prague against the Czechoslovak Republic, delivered a note to the US Embassy in Prague on October 21st. The note stated: The responsible authorities of the Czechoslovak government, based on irrefutable evidence, have learned that US diplomatic officials stationed in Prague, Isaac Patch and Samuel Malin, officials of the US Embassy, have abused their diplomatic privileges to direct espionage organizations within Czechoslovakia. This espionage organization was formed in March 1948 by Paulhan, a former official of the US Embassy. Paulhan colluded with Czechoslovak citizens Nychansky and Weihrla, ordering them to organize several illegal groups. Paulhan met with them periodically and directed their espionage activities. With Paulhan's help, Spencer Bogart, a former official of the US Embassy, established contact with this espionage organization in July 1948 and began directing it. In the autumn of 1948, Malin used his car to transport two of the latest US-designed and manufactured radio stations to the Slany district and two to the Pisek district, handing them over to the various groups within the aforementioned espionage organization, along with instructions, plans, and codes. Before leaving Czechoslovakia to return to the US, Paulhan left US Embassy official Isaac Patch as his assistant in directing the espionage organization and obtaining intelligence from it. Patch was subsequently replaced by Louis Schaffner, the Third Secretary of the US Embassy, who continued to direct the espionage organization until it was uncovered and its members were arrested. The Czech Foreign Ministry has learned that Louis Schaffner left Czechoslovak territory on October 13th.

Based on the above, the Czech Foreign Ministry has decided: 1. To solemnly protest against the aforementioned US Embassy personnel's abuse of diplomatic privileges and positions to engage in activities aimed at jeopardizing the security of the Czechoslovak Republic. 2. To demand that Isaac Patch leave the territory of the Czechoslovak Republic within twenty-four hours. 3. The Czechoslovak security organs will arrest Samuel Malin, an official of the US Embassy, based on the aforementioned evidence.

　　美外交人员进行间谍活动
  　捷照会美使馆抗议
    并将间谍分子予以驱逐和逮捕
    【新华社北京二十四日电】塔斯社布拉格讯：捷克斯洛伐克外交部为驻布拉格美国大使馆官员对捷克斯洛伐克共和国进行间谍与颠覆活动事，于十月二十一日以照会一件送交布拉格美国大使馆。照会略称：捷克斯洛伐克政府的负责机关，根据无可争辩的证据，得悉美国驻捷外交官员伊萨克·派奇及美大使馆官员山慕尔·马林，滥用外交特权，在捷克斯洛伐克境内指挥谍报组织。该谍报组织系于一九四八年三月由美大使馆前任官员柏尔罕组成。柏尔罕勾结捷克斯洛伐克公民涅昌斯基和魏赫拉两人，命令他们组织了几个非法的小组，柏尔罕按期与他们会见并指挥他们的间谍活动。在柏尔罕的帮助下，美大使馆前任官员斯奔色尔·培加尔特于一九四八年七月与这一谍报组织建立了联系，并开始指挥。在一九四八年秋，马林用他的车子把美国最新设计制造的无线电台两座运到斯兰尼城区，两座运到彼塞克城区，交给上述谍报组织的各个小组，并给予训令、计划与密码。柏尔罕在离捷返美前，曾留下美国大使馆官员伊萨克·派奇作为他指挥谍报组织和从该组织获得情报的助手。派奇随后又为美国大使馆三等秘书路易斯·沙弗纳所代替，后者一直指挥谍报组织，以迄该组织被破获，人员被逮捕时为止。捷克外交部已获悉路易斯·沙弗纳业于十月十三日离开捷克斯洛伐克领土。
    根据上述各节，捷克外交部决定：一、对于上述的美大使馆人员滥用外交特权和官职，以进行旨在反对捷克斯洛伐克共和国之安全的这种活动，郑重地提出抗议。二、要求伊萨克·派奇于二十四小时内离开捷克斯洛伐克共和国领土。三、捷克斯洛伐克保安机关即将根据上述证据逮捕美大使馆官员山慕尔·马林。
