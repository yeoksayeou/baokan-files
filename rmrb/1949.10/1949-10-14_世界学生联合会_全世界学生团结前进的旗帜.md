World Student Union—Banner of Solidarity and Progress for Students Worldwide
Li Tu

The World Student Union is a banner of solidarity and progress for students worldwide. It is also a brother organization to the World Federation of Democratic Youth.

The student conference held in London in November 1945, attended by representatives from thirty-nine countries led by the Soviet Union, opened up new paths and prospects for the unity of democratic students in the post-war world. The preparatory body of the student union, which was produced at this conference, immediately launched extensive organizational work. In August of the following year (1946), the World Student Union solemnly held its founding conference in Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia, with student representatives from forty-three countries, representing 1.5 million organized students. Just one year later, in August 1947, when the World Student Union held its council meeting in Prague, the membership of the student union had rapidly increased to 2.5 million members from fifty-one countries. Before the executive committee meeting of the student union in January of this year, the World Student Union already had the participation of democratic student organizations from fifty-four countries, with a total membership of more than 3 million. Now, as the third meeting of the World Student Union Council takes place, more than twenty student organizations from Latin America, the Netherlands, Sweden, and other countries are requesting to join. All this proves one fact: the solidarity and strength of democratic students around the world are rapidly developing and growing in the common struggle for peace and democracy.

The World Student Union constantly struggles for peace and against the new fascist threats, for the freedom and independence of colonial and semi-colonial nations, for the democratization of education and a better future, and for the close unity of the world's youth. Reviewing the work of the World Student Union over the past few years, it can be proved that it is courageously following the aforementioned path forward and is doing a good job of accomplishing its tasks. Precisely because of this, the World Student Union has won the love and support of the world's democratic public and students from various countries.

During the Student Day in 1948 (November 17), the World Student Union organized various "construction teams" of young experts and sent them to Vietnam to help with the construction of the Vietnamese people. Regarding the heroic struggle of Indonesian youth and students and the people against Dutch imperialism, the World Student Union has repeatedly expressed its support and launched a movement to send ambulance teams and deliver medicines to Indonesia. At the same time, the World Student Union has repeatedly lodged strong protests against the atrocities of reactionary governments in various countries in massacring and persecuting democratic and patriotic students, forcing them to have some misgivings about their mad behavior. This spring, the World Student Union designated April 14 as the Day of Solidarity with Spanish Democratic Youth, calling on students around the world to unite in support of the heroic struggle of the Spanish youth.

After the declaration of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace was issued in May of this year, the World Student Union immediately issued a letter to students around the world, calling on students around the world to support the resolutions of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace and actively participate in the struggle to defend peace and the security of all countries. In June, the Executive Committee of the Student Union formally adopted a resolution to defend peace, urging democratic students from various countries to strengthen unity in the struggle for peace and to widely publicize the resolutions and declarations of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace among students. It also called on democratic students to participate in the establishment of peace committees and the fundraising for the International Peace Prize. And in these works and movements, enhance contact and close cooperation with all youth, women, trade unions and other organizations that aim to strengthen peace. At present: the movement to support and defend peace is being widely carried out around the world, and the World Student Union, which unites democratic student organizations from various countries, will surely play an active role in the movement to strengthen the forces of peace.

　　世界学生联合会
    ——全世界学生团结前进的旗帜
    李突
    世界学生联合会，这是全世界学生团结前进的旗帜。它又是世界民主青年联盟的兄弟组织。
    一九四五年十一月在伦敦召开的以苏联为首的三十九个国家代表出席的学生大会，给战后世界民主学生的团结开辟了新的道路和前途。这次所产生的学联筹备机构随即就广泛展开了组织工作。第二年（一九四六）八月，世界学生联合会就在捷克京城布拉格隆重举行成立大会，参加的有四十三国的学生代表，代表着一百五十万有组织的学生。刚刚一年以后，一九四七年八月，世界学联在布拉格召开理事会时，学联会员已经迅速增加到五十一国的二百五十万会员。到今年一月学联执委开会前，世界学联则已有五十四个国家的民主学生组织参加，共拥有会员三百余万。现在，当世界学联理事会第三次会议时，又有拉丁美洲、荷兰、瑞典等二十多国家的学生组织要求参加。这一切证明了一个事实：世界民主学生在争取和平民主的共同斗争中，他们的团结和力量正迅速发展与壮大起来。
    世界学联经常为和平与反对新的法西斯威胁而斗争，为殖民地半殖民地民族的自由与独立而斗争、为教育民主化与美好前途、为世界青年自身的紧密团结而斗争。检阅一下世界学联几年来的工作，就可以证明它是在勇毅地遵循着前述道路前进，并很好地完成着它的任务。正因为这一点，世界学联才得到世界民主公众和各国学生的热爱和拥护。
    在一九四八年的学生节（十一月十七日），世界学联组织了各种青年专家的“建设队”，派去到越南，帮助越南人民的建设。对于印尼青年学生与人民英勇反荷帝国主义的斗争，世界学联曾多次的予以声援，并发动一个派遣救护队和运送医药到印尼去的运动。同时，世界学联对于各国反动政府屠杀和迫害民主爱国学生的暴行，都一再提出强烈抗议，使他们的疯狂行为不得不有所顾虑。今年春，世界学联定四月十四日为与西班牙民主青年团结日，号召世界学生一致支持西班牙青年的英勇斗争。
    今年五月世界拥护和平大会宣言发出后，世界学联立即发表告全世界学生书，号召全世界学生支持世界拥护和平大会的决议，并积极参加保卫和平与各国安全的斗争。六月学联执委会复正式通过保卫和平的决议，敦促各国民主学生在争取和平的斗争中加强团结，在学生中间广泛宣传世界拥护和平大会的决议和宣言。并号召民主学生参加成立和平委员会和为国际和平奖金募集基金的工作。并在这些工作和运动中增进与一切以加强和平为目的的青年、妇女、职工会和其他团体的联系和与之密切配合。目前：世界各地拥护与保卫和平运动正在广泛开展，团结了各国民主学生组织的世界学联，必将在加强和平力量的运动中起积极的作用。
