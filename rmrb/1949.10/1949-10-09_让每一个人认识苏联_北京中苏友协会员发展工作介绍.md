　　Letting Everyone Know the Soviet Union
　　-- An Introduction to the Membership Development Work of the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association
　　The Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association is about to be formally established today. It has a foundation of 120,000 members. A delegation of Soviet cultural, artistic, and scientific workers will participate as guests. The Red Army Choir and the Outbound Performing Arts Troupe will also perform to celebrate its establishment. This is a rare honor.

　　The inaugural meeting will be held at the Zhongshan Hall in Zhongshan Park. When the First Beijing People's Representative Conference was held here two months ago, the representatives discussed and initiated the organization of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, which was unanimously approved by the conference. Subsequently, a preparatory committee of 105 people was formed through consultation among various parties and circles, and preparatory work began.

　　Before liberation, due to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's distortion of facts, rampant rumors, news blockade, and suppression of speech, the broad masses of people were deprived of not only the freedom to befriend the Soviet Union, but also the freedom to know the Soviet Union. Today, the Kuomintang reactionaries have been defeated, and the biggest obstacle to developing friendship between China and the Soviet Union has been removed. The opportunity to learn from the Soviet Union's revolutionary construction experience is now before every Chinese person. However, the Kuomintang's counter-propaganda still has considerable influence. Therefore, defeating all reactionary propaganda has become a prerequisite for developing Sino-Soviet friendship and a necessary step for developing membership in the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. The preparatory committee of the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association put a lot of effort into this area. The 120,000 members can be said to be the initial result of this work.

　　The conference of Party members, League members, and worker-student activists convened by the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China at the Concert Hall on August 21, where Comrade Peng Zhen delivered a report, and the Soviet Construction Photo Exhibition organized by the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters played a significant role in promoting this membership development. With the leadership of Party members and activists, many factories and schools launched publicity and began to discuss developing membership. Peking University jointly held a large symposium by the Party branch, League branch, Student Union, Faculty and Staff Association, and Security Guard Association. A worker said, "The Soviet Union is the old liberated area of the world, and we should learn from the Soviet Union in every aspect." After publicity and discussion, more than 1,800 members were developed, reportedly accounting for more than 90 percent of the total number of people in Peking University. After organized publicity, the concept of "workers of the world are one family" was established among the broad masses of workers. By mid-September, the city's membership had reached 55,000, which was the first stage.

　　On September 18, the preparatory committee of the Beijing branch invited Comrade Chen Shaoyu to give another lecture on "Understanding the Soviet Union" at the Zhongshan Park Concert Hall, which further clarified many issues in the minds of cadres and the masses. From September 21 to 27, the branch preparatory committee and Xinhua Broadcasting Station jointly organized a broadcast week, including lectures, stories, forums, reports, and music, and organized factory and school groups to listen, which also achieved considerable results. One worker said after listening, "In the past, I didn't understand the Soviet Union, but now I realize that the Soviet Union is our true friend." Gan Xuanli, a worker at the 70th Ordnance Factory, made a more specific proposal: "Our factory should quickly establish a branch and systematically introduce Soviet technology."

　　The development of citizen members was best achieved in the Eighth District. When the district began to mobilize, some people asked whether joining the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association meant they would have to join the army in the future. Some people asked: Would the membership fee increase more and more in the future and become a form of exorbitant taxes? Some people also asked: What are the benefits of being a member of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association? But after they held various large and small forums, led by the neighborhood chiefs and activists, now one out of every five citizens in the Eighth District is a member, not including members in government agencies and schools. This is worth learning from other districts and units.

　　The work of developing membership is not yet over, but 120,000 is already a considerable number. After the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association is established, how to consolidate the foundation of these 120,000 people, serve them well, and make these 120,000 people all promoters, take responsibility among the 2 million people, and let every citizen of the new China's capital have a correct understanding of the Soviet Union, has become an important task of the soon-to-be-formed first council of the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association.

　　让每一个人认识苏联
    ——北京中苏友协会员发展工作介绍
    北京市中苏友好协会就要在今天正式成立了。它有十二万会员作基础，将有远道而来的苏联文化艺术科学工作者代表团以来宾资格参加，还要有红军歌舞团和出国文工团的演出来庆祝它的成立，这是罕有的光荣。
    成立大会在中山公园中山堂举行。当两个月前，第一届北京各界代表会议在这里召开时，代表们酝酿发起组织中苏友协，获得了大会的全体通过。接着由各党派各界协商产生了包括一百零五人的筹委会，开始了筹备工作。
    解放以前，由于蒋介石匪帮颠倒是非，漫天造谣，封锁新闻，箝制言论，广大人民不要说和苏联作朋友，就是认识苏联的自由也给剥夺了。今天，国民党反动派已被打垮，发展中苏两国友谊的最大障碍是扫除了，学习苏联革命建设经验的机会已摆在每个中国人民的面前。但国民党的反宣传还留下不少影响。因此，打垮一切反动宣传，成了发展中苏友谊的前提，也成了发展中苏友协会员的必要步骤。北京中苏友协筹委会在这方面下了一番工夫。十二万会员可以说是这一工作的初步成绩。
    八月二十一日在音乐堂中共北京市委召集由彭真同志作报告的党团员和工人学生积极分子大会，和中苏友协总会举办的苏联建设图片展览会对这次会员发展起了很大推动作用。由于党团员积极份子的带头，许多工厂和学校分别展开宣传，酝酿发展会员。北大由党支、团支、学生会、教职员会和工警会联合举行大座谈会，一位工友说：“苏联是全世界的老解放区，我们处处都应向苏联学习。”在宣传酝酿之后发展了一千八百多会员，据说占北大全人数百分之九十以上。在进行了有组织的宣传之后，广大工人群众中建立了“世界工人是一家”的观念，到九月中，全市会员发展到五万五千人，这是第一阶段。
    九月十八日北京分会筹委会请陈绍禹同志在中山公园音乐堂又讲了一次“对苏联的认识”，使许多问题在干部和群众思想中进一步明确起来。九月二十一日至二十七日分会筹委会和新华广播电台合办了一个广播周，包括讲演、故事、座谈、报告和音乐，并组织了工厂和学校群众收听，也收到相当效果，一般听众欢迎这种灵活多样的广播方式。一位工友听后说：“过去我对苏联不了解，现在才认识苏联是我们真正的朋友。”七十兵工厂的干宣力工友更具体的提议：“本厂要赶快成立支会，有计划有系统的介绍苏联技术才好。”
    市民会员的发展以八区的成绩为最好。在该区开始发动时，有些人问，参加了中苏友好协会是不是将来要当兵？有人问：会费是不是以后越收越多，成为一种苛捐杂税？还有些人问：做了中苏友协的会员究竟有什么好处？但经过他们举行各种大小座谈会，由闾长和积极分子带头，现在八区每五个市民里面就有一个会员，机关学校里的会员还不在内。这是值得其他区和单位学习的。
    发展会员这一工作还没有结束，但十二万人已不是一个小数目，北京中苏友协成立后，如何巩固这十二万人的基础，为他们好好服务，并且使这十二万人都成为宣传员，在二百万人中负起责任，让新中国首都每一个市民对苏联都有正确的认识，这已成为即将产生的第一届北京中苏友协理事会的重要任务了。
