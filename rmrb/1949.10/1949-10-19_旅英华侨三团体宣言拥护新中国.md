Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 16th. London dispatch: The Democratic Front Society of Patriotic Overseas Chinese in Britain, the London Republican Society, and the Liverpool Seamen's Union jointly issued a declaration on the 11th, celebrating the founding of the People's Republic of China. The declaration said: "We patriotic Overseas Chinese workers in Britain have long been convinced that the Chinese Communist Party led by Chairman Mao Zedong will surely succeed in rescuing the people of our motherland from the iron-fisted rule of imperialism and its running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek Kuomintang bandit gang. The time we have long awaited to celebrate the people's New China has now arrived. As the joyful news spreads at home and abroad, the reactionary rhetoric is becoming increasingly bankrupt, and the ending is already disorganized. While celebrating the founding of the People's Republic of China, we express our firm support for the Central People's Government led by the Chinese Communist Party in implementing the people's democratic dictatorship to the end. Long live the People's Republic of China! Long live the Central People's Government! Long live the Chinese People's Liberation Army! Long live the great people's leader Chairman Mao!"

　　旅英华侨三团体宣言拥护新中国
    【新华社布拉格十六日电】伦敦讯，旅英爱国华侨团体民主阵线社、伦敦共和社、利物浦海员工会十一日联合发表宣言，庆祝中华人民共和国成立。宣言说：“我们旅英的爱国华侨工人，久已深信毛泽东主席领导的中国共产党一定会达到把祖国人民从帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石国民党匪帮的铁蹄统治下拯救出来。我们久已盼望的庆祝人民的新中国的时候现已到临了。在此欢欣鼓舞之声传播中外的时候，反动派的滥调愈来愈破产，而调尾已乱得不象样了。我们在庆祝中华人民共和国成立之余，表示坚决拥护中国共产党领导的中央人民政府执行人民民主专政到底。中华人民共和国万岁！中央人民政府万岁！中国人民解放军万岁！伟大的人民领袖毛主席万岁！”
