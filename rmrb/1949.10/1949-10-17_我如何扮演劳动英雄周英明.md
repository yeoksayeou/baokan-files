　　How I Played Labor Hero Zhou Yingming
　　Zhang Ping
　　In January of this year, I received a notice to participate in the performance of "Boundless Radiance," and was assigned the role of the labor hero "Zhou Mingying" in the play. The author, Comrade Chen Boer, told me that the script was based on the materials of Liu Yingyuan, a special-class labor hero from the Harbin Power Plant. She explained in detail Liu Yingyuan's heroic deeds in overcoming all difficulties to restore the Harbin power plant in 1946. Finally, Comrade Boer emphasized that Liu Yingyuan was a typical industrial worker, and Zhou Mingying in the play was created using Liu Yingyuan himself as the main thread, combined with the images and characteristics of many progressive workers. Playing this role requires a great deal of effort.
　　After receiving this task, I felt both happy and afraid. I was happy that I could have an opportunity to learn and be educated, and I was afraid that I could not complete the task. But this was the organization's decision, and I could only do my best to complete this glorious task.
　　Under the Party's cultivation for more than ten years, although I have accumulated a little acting experience, in the past, I was in a rural environment, and most of the roles I have played were peasants and soldiers. I have also played in a few worker plays, but due to my own lack of political cultivation, life experience, and performance skills, I always felt unsatisfied.
　　First, after reading the script several times myself, and discussing it with the author and director several times, and learning about the character's background from them in detail, I began to write a preliminary autobiography for the character, about his origin, experience (suffering), the transformation of his thoughts and feelings, the relationship with other characters in the play...etc. After making a preliminary draft, I visited and listened to Comrade Liu Yingyuan's reports, and enriched my autobiography again. During this time, I also studied the deeds and achievements of labor heroes from various parts of Northeast China, and recalled many materials I had remembered before. In Yan'an, I had collected Zhao Zhankui's deeds, impressions... and the deeds of other model workers. I watched many Soviet films, "The Rural Teacher," "Siberian Symphony," "Government Member," "Edison, the Man"... The deeds in these films absorbed a lot of materials I needed and gave me a lot of inspiration. At the same time, I read Gorky's "Mother" and "Cement"... and other novels and reportage literature describing workers. I studied why Gorky wrote workers so beautifully and lovingly? What are the basic characteristics of the working class?
　　This research and preparation work took a total of more than two months. During this period, I also participated in the director's work of revising the script. This work helped me to understand the script and the role more deeply with the help of the director, so I further created the role.
　　First of all, I must affirm the basic character and thoughts and feelings of Zhou Mingying, this worker labor hero. Vera Maretskaya, the actress who played the "Rural Teacher" in "The Rural Teacher," once had this passage in her actor's notes: "...To achieve consistency with the character's thoughts, you must live and observe with the character you are portraying... The main requirement is to achieve ideological consistency, not just image consistency..." Yes! Only after fully familiarizing yourself with everything about the character can you express his certain ideology in all his words and actions, especially in each period. In this way, I drew up several outlines for myself: 1. How to grasp the thoughts and feelings of the workers? 2. How to grasp the typical feelings of the workers? 3. How to turn this feeling into my own? 4. How to express the character's feelings from myself again? After many researches and careful readings of the script, and many explorations and thoughts, I closed the door of my room and practiced my lines, shouting, speaking, walking, and moving like crazy... Then I looked at the collected and newly collected materials, and comprehensively, the image of Zhou Mingying gradually grew in my mind.
　　Zhou Mingying's background is very touching. He raised pigs for landlords in his childhood, worked as a part-time laborer, and served as a cigarette apprentice. Later, he entered a factory to learn fitter work... Under the devastation and oppression of the puppet Manchuria for more than ten years, he could not hold his head up. Like ordinary workers, he had suffered from the oppression of feudal imperialism, warlords, and capitalists for many years, living a life like cattle and horses. It was not until the Communist Party came that he was liberated. Gradually, he saw that the Communist Party's strength and policies were truly for the benefit of the workers. He was moved. The changes in his living environment also changed his thoughts and emotions. He changed from a working class in itself to a conscious one. When his class consciousness was fully awakened, he regarded the factory as his own life. He stood up as the master of the house, and his true essence and real human character were revealed.
　　This is how I designed his character image. He is a true typical representative of the proletariat. He possesses all the good qualities that the working class should have. He is selfless and fearless for the cause of his class. He has an extremely honest and loyal character. He treats people with enthusiasm and kindness. Because of the habit of working for many years, he is taciturn, but his body is very burly and his voice is loud. He is extremely responsible for his work, willing to use his mind, and does not slack off in the slightest. He is not conservative in technology at all. In order to overcome the difficulties and repair the generator that was destroyed by the Kuomintang, he united all the workers to repair the machine. But soon after it was repaired, it was destroyed and burned by Kuomintang agents. However, the leadership not only did not blame him but encouraged him, which further promoted his enthusiasm. Then, in the second repair, he worked day and night for more than 20 days, forgetting to sleep and eat, and with unprecedented creative labor, he finally combined the two abandoned generators (the two largest ones were considered irreparable during the puppet Manchuria era) and repaired them into good machines, overcoming various difficulties and never giving up. He made a great contribution after the first repair and was selected as a labor hero. When he returned from attending the model worker conference, he felt that this was something he had never experienced in his life. He felt ten years younger in spirit and became as happy and lively as a child. He cried, and tears fell from his eyes....
　　Regarding the workers' feelings, the solution was obtained from Comrade Liu Yingyuan. When I asked him how he felt when he first repaired the generator and when the electricity was first generated, he said, "I was just happy. After working so hard for so long, I finally fixed it (the machine)..." From here, I understood how moved he was in his heart. He told us about his background and how he repaired the machine and became a hero. When talking about his own bitter background, his father died and there was no coffin, and he only wore two pairs of single pants in winter... he couldn't help but cry and stopped speaking. I cried with him at the time, and immediately calmed down and thought that this kind of emotion must be experienced more deeply, because there is a passage in my play where I am also talking to myself, reciting the speech, talking about my own bitter background, and being sad and resentful about the dissatisfaction with the old society. I asked him to take a break and then continue talking. He said: "Damn it, I don't want to talk about this part of my life that wasn't human..." Then he continued...
　　He often talked to me about his bitter background, and I often listened to him intently. Because he was poor, he didn't have the opportunity to go to school, and he hoped that we young people would study hard under the Party's cultivation and do more things for the working people in the future. Yes, I should remember his words and be determined to perform Zhou Mingying's heroic life (although it is not fully shown on the screen, but some of it is introduced to the audience) and how he became a hero truthfully. This was my feeling at the time. In the process of filming, I tried my best to do this. Due to my own cultivation, I am still not completely satisfied, but I have tried my best.

　　我如何扮演劳动英雄周英明
    张  平
    今年一月份我接到通知，参加“光芒万丈”的演出，指定我扮演剧中劳动英雄“周明英”一角，作者陈波儿同志告诉我说：这个剧本是根据哈尔滨发电厂特等劳动英雄刘英源同志的材料创作的。她把刘英源在四六年克服一切困难修复哈市发电厂的英雄事迹详细的序述了一遍。最后波儿同志着重的说：刘英源是一个典型的产业工人，剧中的周明英就是用刘英源本人作主线又结合了许多进步工人的形象与特点而出现的，你演这个角色是需要大大的下一番工夫。
    我接到这个任务以后，感到既高兴又害怕，高兴的是我能得到一次学习与受教育的机会，怕我不能完成这个任务，但这是组织的决定，我只有尽力完成这个光荣的任务。
    在党十多年来的培养下，虽然自己积累了不多的一点演剧经验，但过去是农村的环境，我所演过的角色大多数是农民、士兵，也演过几次工人戏，可是限于自己的政治修养，生活体验与表现技能的不足，总觉得不能满意。
    首先我自己读了几次剧本之后，又和作者、导演研究了几次，从他们口中详细的了解人物的身世，我就开始为人物写了初步自传，关于他的出身、经历（苦难的遭遇）思想感情的转变，与剧中其他人物的关系……等，皆作初步的草拟之后，我又访问与听取刘英源同志的报告，再次充实了我的自传，这当中我又研究了许多东北各地工人劳动英雄的事迹，立功经过，又回忆起不少从前所记忆的材料，在延安曾收集了赵占魁的事迹，印象……以及其他劳模的事迹，看了不少苏联电影，“万世师表”“西伯利亚交响曲”“政府委员”“爱迪生传”（美国片子）……这些影片里的事迹吸取了很多我所需要的材料，给了我很多的启发，在这同时我阅读了高尔基的“母亲”和“士敏土”……等有着描写工人的小说与报道文学，我研究高尔基为什么把工人写得那样美？可爱？工人阶级的基本特点是什么？
    这样的研究酝酿工作，一共有两个多月的时间，这期间内还参加导演修改剧本的工作，这一工作使我对剧本和角色的认识经过导演的帮助更深了一步，于是我进一步地创造了角色。
    首先我必须肯定周明英这个工人劳动英雄的基本性格与思想感情，“万世师表”中扮演“乡村女教师”的演员薇拉玛列茨卡她在自己演员手记中，曾有这样一段话“……要做到与角色思想一致，必须去和你所表现的人物一道生活观察……主要的要求得思想上的一致，不仅是形象上的一致……”是的！也只有全部熟悉了人物的一切之后，才能作到在角色的一切语言行动中表现他的一定思想性，特别是每一个时期的，这样，我给我自己拟出了几个提纲，一、如何把握工人的思想感情？二、如何把握工人典型的感情？三、如何把这种感情变成自己的？四、如何从自己的身上再把角色的感情表现出来？经过多次的研究精读剧本，多次的摸索思考，关住自己的房门在屋里练习自己的戏发疯的叫、说、走、动……再看已搜集的和新搜集的材料，综合起来，周明英的形象逐步的在我心目中成长起来。
    周明英的身世是很动人的，他幼年时给地主放过猪，当过半拉子，当过卷烟学徒，以后又进入工厂学钳工……在伪满十余年与国民党摧残压迫下，他抬不起头来，他和一般工人一样，多年来受尽了封建帝国主义，军阀、资本家的压迫，过的牛马一样的生活，一直到共产党来了，他被解放，逐渐他看到了共产党的力量与政策是真正的为了工人群众谋利益的，他感动了，生活环境的变化，使他思想情绪亦起了变化，他从工人阶级的自在变化到自觉自为，在他的阶级觉悟完全觉醒了时，他把工厂看成自己的生命，他以主人公的姿态站起来了，他的真正的本质真实人的性格显露出来了。
    我是这样设计他的性格形象的，他是一个真正的无产阶级的典型代表，他具备了一切工人阶级应有善良的品质，他为了自己阶级的事业，是奋不顾身的，他有着极其老实忠厚的性格，他待人是热情厚道的，因为多年劳动的习惯，使他沉默寡言，但他的身体是非常魁梧，声音洪亮，他对工作极其负责，肯用心思，丝毫不苟，他在技术上一点也不保守，为了克服困难修复被国民党破坏的发电机，他团结了全体工人修复机器，但刚修好不久又被国民党特务破坏烧毁了，可是领导上不但不责备反而鼓励他，这样更促进了他的积极性，接着在第二次的修复中二十几天以日继夜忘寝废食地以空前的创造劳动，终于在克服各种困难百折不挠的使两台废弃了的发电机（最大两台伪满时都认为无法修理的）结合起来，修成了好机器，经过第一次修复他就立了功，被选为劳动英雄。当他参加劳模大会返来时觉着这是他生平没有经过的事，他精神上年轻了十年，变得和孩子一样的快乐活泼起来，他哭了，他掉下了眼泪……。
    关于工人的感情，从刘英源同志身上得到了解决，当我问他第一次修好发电机，第一次发出电来的时候，他感觉是怎样的，他说“就是高兴，忙了这么久，总算是把它（机器）给整好了………”从这里我了解了他内心的感情，是多么感动啊，他给我们讲他的身世以及如何修机器，当英雄，当谈到他自己的苦身世，他父亲死了，没有棺材，冬天只穿两条单裤子时……泣不成声的说下去了，我也和他一起哭了，当时立即就冷静的想到这样的情感，一定要再更深的体验一下，因为我戏里有一段，也是自言自语的在背演讲词，说到自己的苦身世，又难过又愤恨的对旧社会的不满，请他休息一下再讲下去，他说：“他妈的，不是人的日子我总不愿讲这一段……”他又讲下去了……。
    他常和我谈他的苦身世，我常是入神的听他讲，因穷没有上学的机会，希望我们年青人在党的培养下好好学习将来给劳苦大众多做事情，是的，我应该记住他的话，并决心把周明英这个英雄的一身，（在银幕上虽然没有完全的表现出来，但也有部分介绍给了观众）以及他如何的当了英雄真实的把它表演出来，这是我当时的感情在拍戏的过程中，我尽量努力的做到，这一点，由于自己的修养还不能完全满意，心是尽到了。
