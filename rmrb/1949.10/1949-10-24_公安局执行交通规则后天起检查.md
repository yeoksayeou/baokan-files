　　Public Security Bureau to Enforce Traffic Rules
  　Inspections to Begin the Day After Tomorrow
    [From Our Newspaper] After the Beijing Municipal People's Government announced the "Provisional Traffic Management Rules for Beijing Municipality" on the 10th of last month, in order to allow vehicles of all government agencies, schools, military units, and citizens sufficient time to install the equipment stipulated in the rules, it was announced that all equipment must be installed by the 25th of this month. Starting from the 26th, the Public Security Bureau will implement strict inspections, and any vehicles that violate the regulations will be dealt with severely. The Public Security Bureau once again urges all parties to pay attention and hopes that vehicles that have not complied with the regulations or, for some reason, have not installed all the equipment stipulated in the rules, will install them as soon as possible to avoid violating the regulations.

　　公安局执行交通规则
  　后天起检查
    【本报讯】北京市人民政府于上月十日公布本市交通管理暂行规则后，为使各机关、学校、部队及市民之车辆有充分时间装置条文规定之各项设备，曾通告限期至本月二十五日一律装齐。自二十六日起，公安局即将实施严格检查，对违犯规定车辆一律予以取缔。公安局顷再度促起各方注意，希未照规章或因故尚未按照条文规定装齐各项设备之车辆，及早装齐，以免触犯规章。
