　　Shenyang Holds Grand Rally of 500,000 People
    Celebrating the Establishment of the Central People's Government and Hold Demonstration to Defend World Peace
    [Special Dispatch from Our Correspondent Yao Fu, Shenyang, 2nd] Shenyang, the largest industrial city in Northeast China, held a grand rally of 500,000 people on the 2nd to celebrate the success of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the establishment of the Central People's Government, and to defend world peace. Before dawn, various agencies, organizations, schools, troops, and citizens gathered separately in designated squares. At 8 o'clock, they began to enter the venue in an orderly manner. The venue was located on the clean, radiating roads with Zhongshan Square as the core. The tall, red rostrum, symbolizing a fortress of peace, was repaired by 163 workers in 68 hours. It was decorated with nine huge national flags and 120 small flags, and surrounded by portraits of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and the seven chairmen and vice-chairmen of the Central People's Government headed by Chairman Mao. Looking out from the rostrum, the boundless three streams of people were colorful and filled with the sound of gongs and drums. Under the clear sky, they appeared energetic, enthusiastic, and fervent. At 9 o'clock, with the sound of cannons, exploding firecrackers, and the simultaneous sounding of sirens, forty-seven hydrogen balloons, symbolizing the peace of 475 million people and adorned with bright red national flags, slowly floated into the air. As the entire population paid attention, more than 10,000 national flags were raised throughout the venue. Shenyang instantly became a red sea on land. Mayor Zhu Qiwen, the chairman, announced the opening of the meeting in an excited tone. He said that the Chinese revolution, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, and with the tenacious struggle of the people of the whole country, has been victorious. We now have our own capital—the people's capital, Beijing; our own national flag, symbolizing the great unity of the people of the whole country; our own national anthem, arousing the people's struggle; our own era designation, and we have our own charter, which is an indicator to guide our nation-building. He also said: At this moment, the imperialists are engaging in war, and we must defend lasting world peace, support the world's peace fortress, the Soviet Union, and support the World Peace Congress and the China Peace Committee.
