Xiyang County Government Office Bulletin, Compiled by the Agricultural Department of the North China People's Government

　　Many households in Xizhuang Village, Fifth District of Xiyang, without draft animals wanted to cultivate their land in the autumn, but they felt that since the autumn harvest had just finished, grass and fodder were cheap. They felt that it was not cost-effective to exchange grass and money for animal labor to cultivate the land. They thought it would be better to wait until spring when grass and fodder were expensive, so they could use less fodder. On the other hand, households with draft animals felt that earning wages for odd jobs was higher than earning wages for plowing land, and they were afraid that if they took on land, their animals would be overworked when plowing their own land, so they were unwilling to take on land.
　　In response to the above situation, the leadership immediately led the masses to compare benefits. During the comparison, Zhao Fuyi said: "Wang Yulin from our village did not plow his land in the autumn the year before last. Last year, he sowed the seeds but did not achieve full seedling emergence. The land that others plowed in the autumn not only achieved full seedling emergence but also grew very well. Wang Yulin was so anxious that he slapped his thighs and kept shouting, regretting that he should not have waited until spring when grass and fodder were expensive to plow the cheaper land." Wang Guilin said: "Although the wages for odd jobs are higher in the autumn, if you calculate carefully, it is not really an advantage, because there are few people in the market in the autumn, and goods are difficult to move. It is difficult to carry a load even once in ten days. The result is that you only want to earn big money, but you miss out on earning small money. If you take on land, there is a steady stream of work, and you are guaranteed to have work every day. In the long run, you will not earn less than doing odd jobs. Besides, you earn more grass and fodder by taking on land in the autumn than in the spring." Through such a comparison of benefits, the thinking of both sides was clarified.
　　After resolving the ideological obstacles to autumn cultivation, the leadership immediately organized the masses to adjust draft animals in two ways.
　　First, mobilize the masses to find their own connections and exchange grass and fodder for animal labor, solving the draft animal problem for seven households without draft animals.
　　Second, mobilize the masses to calculate together and exchange manual labor for animal labor. For example, Yang Guibao did not have draft animals but planned to buy cattle next spring and wanted to save grass and fodder for the cattle to eat, so he was unwilling to exchange grass and fodder for labor. Huang Zhen had surplus animal labor but planned to repair his land after the autumn harvest. In this way, Yang Guibao repaired the land for Huang Zhen, exchanged it for animal labor for autumn cultivation, and saved grass and fodder, without affecting his plan to buy cattle next spring.
　　As a result, all thirteen households without draft animals in the village smoothly carried out autumn cultivation.

### 西庄村发动秋耕经验

　　西庄村发动秋耕经验
    昔阳县政府办公室通报华北人民政府农业部整理
    昔阳五区西庄村许多没牲口户，在秋耕中想秋耕地，但是觉得才收了秋，草料贱，出草出钱换牲口工耕地不合算，不如等明春草料贵了再耕，少出草料。另一方面养牲口户觉得揽脚比揽地工资高，又怕揽了地，耕自己地时牲口受紧，因此不愿揽地。
    领导上针对以上情况，即领导群众进行利益对比。在对比中赵福义说：“咱村王玉林，在前年没有秋耕了地，去年养种一年也没有捉住全苗。别人秋耕的地不但捉住全苗，而且长得很好。急得王玉林拍着大腿光喊，后悔不该等春天草料贵了耕便宜地。”王贵林说：“虽说秋天揽脚工资高些，可是仔细算一下，也不占先，因为秋天集上人稀，货下不动，十天也难驮一回脚，结果是光想赚大钱，可误了赚零钱。要是揽地，营生稠，天数保把，日子长了并不比揽脚少赚，再说秋天揽地还比春天揽地多赚草料。”经过这样的利益对比，打通了两方面的思想。
    在解决了秋耕思想障碍后，领导上即以两种方式来组织群众进行牲口调剂。
    一、发动群众自找关系，以草料换牲口工，解决了七个没牲口户的畜力问题。
    二、发动群众，双方计算，以人工换牲口工。如杨贵保没牲口，但计划明春买牛，要留下草料给牛吃，不愿以草料换工。黄桢是牲口有剩余工，却准备秋后修地，这样杨贵宝就给黄桢修地，换了牲口秋耕，留下草料，不误明春买牛。
    结果全村没牲口的十三户，都顺利的进行了秋耕。
