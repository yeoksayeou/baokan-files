Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 1st. Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China announced the Announcement of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China today in the capital of the new China. This was announced at the ceremony celebrating the establishment of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China in Beijing. The ceremony was held in front of Tiananmen in Beijing, and 300,000 people including all the representatives of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and workers from various factories, teachers and students from various schools, personnel from various agencies, citizens, farmers from the suburbs, and city defense troops in the capital participated in this ceremony. The rostrum was set up on the Tiananmen Gate tower, facing the People's Square, which was full of people and fluttering red flags. When Chairman Mao Zedong appeared on the rostrum, the entire venue erupted in cheers and applause.

At 3 p.m., Lin Boqu, Secretary-General of the Central People's Government Committee, announced the start of the ceremony. The Chairman, Vice-Chairmen, and members of the Central People's Government took their places, the band played the March of the Volunteers, and Chairman Mao Zedong announced: "The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China is established today." Chairman Mao personally turned on the button with a wire connected to the national flag flagpole in the center of the square, causing the first new national flag to slowly rise in the capital of the new China. At this moment, amidst the sounds of military music, fifty-four saluting guns fired twenty-eight salvos. Chairman Mao read the Announcement of the Central People's Government (see separate dispatch).

After Chairman Mao finished reading the announcement, the military parade began. The military parade was inspected by Commander-in-Chief Zhu De of the People's Liberation Army, with General Nie Rongzhen, Commander of the North China Military Region and Commander of the Beijing-Tianjin Garrison, serving as the Commander-in-Chief of the parade. Commander-in-Chief Zhu inspected the troops of various services and returned to the rostrum to read the order of the Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army. The reviewed troops then marched in formation past the rostrum from east to west, lasting three hours. The reviewed troops were led by two platoons of the Navy, followed by an infantry division, an artillery division, a tank division, and a cavalry division, successively. The Air Force, including fourteen fighter planes, Mosquito aircraft, and trainer aircraft, flew over the entire venue from east to west for the review. During the military parade, the applause throughout the venue was like waves, one climax after another.

As the military parade neared its end, it was getting late, and Tiananmen Square had turned into a sea of red lights. Countless colorful fireworks were launched from around the venue. The cheering masses began to march after the military parade ended. As the masses passed near the rostrum and exited the venue, shouts of "Long live the People's Republic!" and "Long live Chairman Mao!" resounded to the skies. Chairman Mao loudly replied in front of the amplifier: "Long live the comrades!" Chairman Mao leaned out and repeatedly waved to the masses, who cheered, applauded, danced, and were filled with enthusiasm, unable to control themselves. By the time the marching队伍 (d队伍 - a typo in the original, I presume) had all orderly exited the venue, it was 9:25 p.m. The masses marching with red lanterns passed through the entire city like a fire dragon, immersing the new capital in revelry until late at night.

    【新华社北京一日电】中华人民共和国中央人民政府毛泽东主席，今日在新中国首都宣布中华人民共和国中央人民政府公告。这是在北京庆祝中华人民共和国中央人民政府成立的典礼上宣布的。典礼在北京天安门前举行，参加这个典礼的有中国人民政协全体代表和首都各工厂职工、各学校师生、各机关人员、市民、近郊农民和城防部队共三十万人。主席台设在天安门城楼上，面对着列满群众和飘扬满红旗的人民广场。当毛泽东主席在主席台上出现时，全场沸腾着欢呼和掌声。
    下午三时，中央人民政府委员会秘书长林伯渠宣布典礼开始。中央人民政府主席、副主席、各委员就位，乐队奏义勇军进行曲，毛泽东主席宣布说：“中华人民共和国中央人民政府已于本日成立了。”毛主席亲自开动有电线通往广场中央国旗旗杆的电钮，使第一面新国旗在新中国首都徐徐上升。这时，在军乐声中，五十四门礼炮齐鸣二十八响。毛主席宣读中央人民政府公告（见另电）。
    毛主席宣读公告完毕，阅兵式开始。阅兵式由人民解放军朱德总司令任检阅司令员，华北军区司令员兼京津卫戍区司令员聂荣臻将军任阅兵总指挥。朱总司令驱车检阅各兵种部队回到主席台上宣读人民解放军总部命令。受阅部队随即分列经主席台前由东向西行进，前后历时三小时。受阅部队以海军两个排为前导，接着是一个步兵师、一个炮兵师、一个战车师、一个骑兵师，相继跟进。空军包括战斗机、蚊式机、教练机共十四架在全场上空自东向西飞行受阅。在阅兵式中，全场掌声象波浪一样，一个高潮接着一个高潮。
    阅兵式接近结束时，天色已晚，天安门广场这时变成了红灯的海洋。无数的彩色火炮从会场四周发射。欢呼着的群众在阅兵式完毕后开始游行。当群众队伍经主席台附近走出会场时，“人民共和国万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”的口号声响入云霄。毛主席在扩音机前大声地回答着：“同志们万岁！”毛主席伸出身子一再地向群众招手，群众则欢呼鼓掌，手舞足蹈，热情洋溢，不能自己。当游行的队伍都已有秩序地一一走出会场时，已是晚间九点二十五分。举着红灯游行的群众象火龙似地穿过全城，使新的首都浸在狂欢里直到深夜。（附图片）
