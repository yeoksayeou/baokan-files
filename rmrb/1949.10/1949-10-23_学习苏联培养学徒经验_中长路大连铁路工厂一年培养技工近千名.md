　　China Changchun Railway Dalian Railway Factory Cultivates Nearly a Thousand Technicians in One Year
　　[This newspaper's dispatch] Dalian Truth News reports: The China Changchun Railway Dalian Railway Factory, learning from the Soviet method of teacher-apprentice contracts, has cultivated nearly a thousand technicians in the past year who are participating in the work of the railway. In the past, the factory also implemented a master-apprentice system, but when apprentices arrived, they were casually assigned a teacher, without any plans, supervision, or inspection. As a result, teachers who were paid by the job focused on their own work to earn more money, while teachers who were not paid by the job were afraid that apprentices would ruin the work and were hesitant to let them try. Some teachers even held conservative and backward ideas, so it took two or three years to train a good apprentice. Last March, after learning from the Soviet method of master-apprentice relationships, both the teacher and apprentice signed a contract. Based on different work situations and the apprentice's education level and age, the teacher guaranteed to teach a certain skill within a certain period, and the apprentice guaranteed to learn a certain skill within a certain period. The factory director signed to guarantee this. To this end, the factory launched a "Respect Teachers, Love Apprentices" movement to make the relationship between teachers and apprentices closer and more united. It was also stipulated that if the teacher completed the plan in the contract on schedule, they would receive a reward; if the apprentice was promoted one grade, they would receive a reward of 750 yuan (rewarded once), and if the apprentice was promoted two grades, they would receive a reward of 1,500 yuan (rewarded once). The results were very good: the teachers taught patiently, and the apprentices studied hard. Generally, apprentices mastered the skills of third- or fourth-grade workers within three or four months. From June of last year to the end of July this year, the factory has trained 940 specialized technicians in eleven types of work, including electrical, lathe, and boiler work, and some have been promoted to seventh-grade workers.

　　学习苏联培养学徒经验
  　中长路大连铁路工厂一年培养技工近千名
    【本报讯】大连实话报消息：中长路大连铁路工厂，学习苏联师徒订合同办法，一年来已培养出近千名技工参加该路工作。按该厂在过去也曾实行过师傅带徒弟办法，但徒弟来了，随便找个老师就算了，既不订计划，也不督促检查。因此，干包活的老师，为了多干活多赚钱，光顾自己埋头干；不干包活的老师，害怕徒弟把活干坏了，不敢放手让徒弟干。甚至有些老师仍抱有保守等落后思想，以至教好一个徒弟得二三年工夫。去年三月，学习了苏联师傅带徒弟的办法，师徒双方签订合同。老师根据不同的工作情况，和徒弟的文化水平、年龄，保证在一定时间内教会一定的技术；徒弟在一定时间内，保证学会一定的技术。并由厂长签字做保证。为此，厂方发动“尊师爱徒”运动，使师徒关系更加密切团结。并订出若老师按期完成合同上的计划时，即得奖励，徒弟提升一级者即奖励七百五十元（奖一次），徒弟提升两级者，奖励一千五百元（奖一次）。结果成绩很好，师傅耐心教，徒弟努力学，一般徒弟在三、四个月内就掌握了三、四级工人的技术。自去年六月到今年七月末，该厂已培养出九百四十名电气、镟床、锅炉等十一种专门技工，有的已提升到七级工人。
