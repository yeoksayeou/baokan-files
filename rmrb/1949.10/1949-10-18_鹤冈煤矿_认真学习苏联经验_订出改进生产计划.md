　　Hegang Coal Mine
  　Seriously Studies Soviet Experience and Develops an Improved Production Plan
    [This newspaper Northeast Special News] Reporter Zhao Chun reports: Since June of this year, Hegang Coal Mine has begun to seriously study Soviet experience and has discovered that there are serious rural-style, decentralized and backward management methods within the mine, hindering the development of production. After much research, a plan has been drafted to further concentrate and rationalize mining, transportation, and machinery use in order to improve production efficiency and overcome serious waste. The mine currently has thirty-one pit mouths, and the mining faces within each pit mouth are very dispersed, with as many as dozens of faces in one pit mouth. Because excavation is dispersed, many faces are not fully excavated, and explosives are not used in a concentrated manner, which is very wasteful. According to the Soviet modern work standard, this is a "peasant mine" rather than an industrialized mine. The mine's machinery use is also quite dispersed, with at least one-third of it unable to fully exert its effectiveness. The mine's existing mechanized coal mining equipment, mainly electric picks (coal cutters) and electric chutes, has also failed to be properly equipped according to the different softness and hardness of the coal and the degree of inclination. After seriously studying Soviet experience, it is now planned to reduce the existing 380 faces in the 31 pit mouths to 150 in order to concentrate the use of explosives, increase the excavation speed, and closely coordinate with coal mining. Once a tunnel is completed, it will be mined immediately to avoid leaving them idle after being excavated early, which only increases maintenance costs. Because excavation is concentrated, many excavation workers can be transferred to coal mining, strengthening the coal mining workforce. Transportation work is also more convenient due to the concentration of mining, and efficiency can also be improved. In terms of machinery use, it is planned to equip them according to the softness and hardness of the coal and the degree of inclination: coal that is soft will not be given coal cutters, so as to concentrate them on hard coal; electric chutes will be given to those with an inclination of less than 30 degrees, and heavy chutes will be used for those above 30 degrees. (Of course, this is only determined based on existing mechanical conditions.) This plan will have a trial period within the four months of the end of this year, and will be officially implemented in January next year. Such concentrated coal mining can improve production efficiency and overcome great waste. However, if implemented, it may still be hindered if the decentralism among the cadres has not been completely corrected. Therefore, the mine bureau organized an inspection team a month ago to go to various mine pits to inspect decentralism in order to make ideological preparations.

　　鹤冈煤矿
  　认真学习苏联经验  订出改进生产计划
    【本报东北专讯】记者赵纯报导：鹤冈煤矿自今年六月以来，开始认真学习苏联经验，发现矿内存在着严重的农村式的分散落后经营办法，阻碍着生产的发展。经多方研究。已拟具将采掘、搬运与机械使用进一步集中合理的计划，以提高生产效率与克服严重的浪费现象。该矿现有三十一个坑口，每个坑口内采掘掌子均很分散，一个坑口内掌子多达数十个。由于掘进分散，很多掌子没有掘到头，用炮也不集中，非常浪费。照苏联现代化工作的说法，这是“农民矿”而不是工业化的矿山。该矿机械使用也相当分散，至少有三分之一以上不能充分发挥效能。该矿现有的机械化采煤设备最主要的是电镐（截煤机）和电溜子亦未能按煤质软硬与倾斜度的不同作适当的配备。在认真学习苏联经验之后，现计划将现有三十一个坑口中三百八十个掌子减至一百五十个，以集中用炮，提高掘进速度，并与采煤密切配合，掘好一个跟着就采，免得掘早了放着不采，徒增维持费用。由于掘进集中，可抽调不少掘进工人采煤，加强了采煤人力。运搬工作也因采掘集中而便捷了，效率亦可提高。在机械使用上，计划按煤质软硬、倾斜度多少配备，煤质软的不给截煤机，以集中于硬质煤上，倾斜度在三十度以下者给电溜子，三十度以上者则用笨溜子。（当然，这只是根据现有机械条件决定的。）这一计划，今年年末四个月内为试作时期，明年一月即可正式实行。如此集中采煤可提高生产效率，克服很大浪费。但实行起来，在干部中分散主义思想尚未彻底纠正的情况下，仍可能受到阻碍，因而该矿局月前即曾组织检查组，分赴各矿坑检查分散主义，以期从思想上作好准备工作。
