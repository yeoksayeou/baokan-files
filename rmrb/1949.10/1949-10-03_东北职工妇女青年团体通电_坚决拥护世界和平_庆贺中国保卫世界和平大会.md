Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 2nd: The Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, the Northeast Democratic Women's Federation, the Preparatory Committee of the New Democratic Youth League of the Northeast, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association of the Northeast, and the Northeast Student Federation today jointly sent a telegram to the Chinese People's Congress for the Defence of World Peace, firmly supporting world peace and opposing new war instigators. The telegram stated:

　　We warmly congratulate the convocation of the Chinese People's Congress for the Defence of World Peace. It will unite all Chinese people with the world's peace and democracy-loving forces led by the Soviet Union to act in unison to defend world peace and oppose war instigators. For a century, the Chinese people have suffered deeply from the trampling of imperialism and its running dogs, the domestic reactionaries, and have long held an irreconcilable hatred for these bloodthirsty war makers. We have undergone a century of long and arduous struggle, and only today, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the great people's leader Mao Zedong, have we achieved a basic victory, overthrown the oppressors at home and abroad, and established the People's Republic of China. We must continue to fight, and with the solidarity and mutual assistance of international friends, we will create a new high tide of economic and cultural construction on our own glorious land. The vast numbers of workers, women, youth, and students in the Northeast will further consolidate the unity of the Chinese people, and under the great banner of Mao Zedong, join hands with peace-loving people all over the world! We will use our labor, work, study, and struggle to consolidate world peace and oppose war makers. In addition, the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Shenyang Municipal People's Government, the Shenyang Municipal People's Representative Conference, the Preparatory Committee of the Shenyang Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Preparatory Committee of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the New Democratic Youth League, the Shenyang Municipal Democratic Women's Federation, the Shenyang Municipal Democratic Youth Federation, and the Shenyang Municipal Student Federation also sent telegrams to the Chinese People's Congress for the Defence of World Peace today, expressing their determination to fight for world peace.
