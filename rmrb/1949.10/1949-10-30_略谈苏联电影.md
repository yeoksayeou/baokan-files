A Brief Discussion of Soviet Films
    Liu Nianqu
    From the end of 1919, when Lenin signed the decree nationalizing the film industry, over the past thirty years, under the active leadership and support of Lenin and Stalin, the Soviet film industry, along with the progress of the Soviet economy and culture, has surpassed American films, which some people once considered remarkable, and reached the highest level in the world, with its influence extending to the entire world.
    Lenin pointed out: "Of all the arts, film is the most important to us." Stalin also repeatedly pointed out: "Film is the greatest tool for mass propaganda." "Film is the greatest tool for large-scale propaganda and agitation; our task is to take this cause into our hands." "In the hands of the Soviet government, film is a great value and an unlimited power." Such instructions, thanks to the continuous efforts of Soviet filmmakers, and with the help of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), have been constantly improved and have been fully realized.
    So far, we have not had the opportunity to see all the Soviet films of the past thirty years in their entirety. However, based on what we have been able to see, from the early "A Simple Case," "We Are From Kronstadt," to the great "Lenin in October," "Lenin in 1918," "Peter the Great," "Thirteen," "Volga, Volga" before the Great Patriotic War, to "Six P.M." "No Days Off Until Victory," "Zoya," "The Magic Horse," "The Rainbow," "The Defence of Stalingrad" during the Great Patriotic War, and "The Vow," "The Young Guard," "The Distant Bride," "Michurin," "Lenin's Life," "Pavlov" and so on after the war, it has been proven that Soviet films, from the very beginning, have been taking their own path, showing their own characteristics, establishing their own system, and serving the Soviet people and their own motherland.
    First and foremost, due to the implementation of the "nationalization of the film industry" decree, and because the Soviet Union is a socialist country, there is a fundamental difference between Soviet films and American (and other capitalist countries') films. This is fully reflected in the themes of all Soviet films, which educate the broad masses of people, fight for freedom and peace, and against exploitation and enslavement; it promotes the spirit of proletarian internationalism. Therefore, even works that are light and lively in form, or those that take their subject matter from legends, are equally serious and have positive ideological content.
    Such themes and such ideological content inevitably require forms and techniques sufficient to express them. Thus, from the very beginning, Soviet films completely broke away from the influence of European and American films, pioneered their own creative path, and embodied Stalin's instruction of "socialist content, national form." Moreover, not long ago, a struggle against cosmopolitanism was launched. Only in this way can it fully realize its own tasks and ascend to the pinnacle of achievement.
    In its development, Soviet film art has enriched itself with the outstanding literary and dramatic heritage of old Russia and promoted its excellent traditions. Here, we can briefly point out two points: one is the tradition of realism that began with Gogol and Pushkin, which is embodied in all film script creations and makes Soviet film scripts valuable literary works. The other is the system of realistic directing and acting established by Stanislavsky and Danchenko, which is embodied in all film directing and acting, making it possible for directors and actors to become the greatest and true artists.
    The Soviet Union is a multi-ethnic country. Based on Lenin and Stalin's ethnic policies, the culture of minority nationalities—the film industry—has also been developed. The output of film studios in the various union republics is no less in quality than that of the film studios in Moscow and Leningrad.
    Documentary films have only received unprecedented attention and development in the Soviet Union (and in the future, also in China and the Eastern European people's democratic countries). The achievements of "The Crimea Conference" and "The Fall of Berlin" are brilliant. "Lenin's Life," which won the Stalin Prize in 1948, is an even more concrete and vivid historical record.
    Finally, we can also point out that the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and the Soviet government's emphasis on the film industry is unprecedented. At the central level, there is a Film Affairs Department, and most of the union republics have their own film departments, which are specifically responsible for leading this work. During the difficult years of the Great Patriotic War, it was not set aside. The annual Stalin Prize for Literature and Art has a film section (divided into feature films and documentary films), and many outstanding workers have been awarded the title of People's Artist and have received the Order of Lenin or the Order of the Red Star. Soviet filmmakers have not failed to live up to this leadership and support, dedicating better work achievements to their motherland and people. During the Great Patriotic War, the number of newsreel photographers who died on the front lines was thirty-eight.
    Generally speaking, this is what Soviet film is like. Today, we have the opportunity to fully appreciate Soviet films. The task before us, whether for filmmakers or for the general audience, is to better learn from Soviet films, to learn all kinds of things we need, to enrich ourselves. In the process of learning, we also need to do further systematic introductions and research.

　　略谈苏联电影
    刘念渠
    从一九一九年年底，列宁签署了电影事业国有化的命令起，这三十年间，苏联电影事业，在列宁与斯大林的积极领导与扶植之下，伴随着苏联的经济与文化的进步，已经超过了过去曾被某些人认为了不起的美国电影，达到了在全世界范围内最高的水准，并以其影响及于全世界。
    列宁指出过：“电影是所有艺术中对我们最重要的。”斯大林也一再的指出过：“电影是最伟大的群众宣传工具。”“电影是大规模宣传鼓动的最伟大的工具，我们的任务是要把这事业抓在手里。”“在苏维埃政权手里，电影是一种伟大的价值和无限的力量。”这样的指示，由于苏联电影工作者的不断努力，在联共（布）党的帮助下不断的改进，是已经完全实现了的。
    迄今为止，我们还没有机会较完全的看到三十年间的全部苏联电影。但是，仅就我们能够看到的说，从初期的“生路”、“我们来自克隆斯达特”起，到伟大的卫国战争以前的“列宁在十月”、“列宁在一九一八年”、“彼得大帝”、“十三勇士”、“伏尔加”，到卫国战争期间的“战后下午六点钟”、“日日夜夜”、“丹娘”、“凤羽飞马”、“虹”、“保卫斯大林格勒”，以及战后的“宣誓”、“青年近卫军”、“远方未婚妻”、“米邱林”、“列宁的生平”、“巴夫洛夫”等等，已经证明了：苏联电影从一开始，就走着它自己的道路，显示着它自己的特点，建立着它自己的体系，服务于苏联人民及人民自己的祖国。
    首先第一，由于执行了“电影事业国有化”的命令，由于苏联是一个社会主义国家，澈头澈尾的与美国（以及其他资本主义国家）的电影有着本质上的区别。这充分反映在一切苏联电影的主题上，它教育着广大人民，为争取自由与和平、为反对剥削与奴役而斗争；它宣扬着无产阶级的国际主义的精神。因此，即使在形式上是轻松活泼的作品，在题材上是采自传说的作品，也同样是严肃的，有着积极的思想内容的。
    这样的主题与这样的思想内容，必然的要求着足以表现它的形式与技术。于是，苏联电影从一开头，就完全摆脱了欧美电影的影响，开拓着自己创作的道路，体现着斯大林的“社会主义的内容，民族的形式”这一指示。并且，不久以前，展开了对于世界主义的斗争。只有这样，才可能完完全全的实现自己的任务，才可以走上登峰造极的境地。
    苏联电影艺术在其发展过程中，曾经以旧俄的优秀的文学与戏剧的遗产丰富了自己，发扬了优秀的传统。这里可以约略的指出两点来，一是从果戈里与普希金开始的现实主义的传统，这体现于所有的电影剧本创作之中了，并使苏联电影剧本成为有价值的文学作品。一是由斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基与丹钦科建立的现实主义的导演和表演的体系，这体现于所有的电影导演与表演之中了，而使导演与演员有成为最伟大的、真正的艺术的可能。
    苏联是多民族的国家。基于列宁与斯大林的民族政策，少数民族的文化——电影事业，同样的得到发展。各加盟共和国的电影制片厂的出品，在质上并不亚于莫斯科的和列宁格勒的各电影制片厂的出品。
    纪录电影，只有在苏联（今后还有中国和东欧人民民主国家）才得到空前的重视与发展。“克里米亚会议”、“进攻柏林”的成就是辉煌的。一九四八年获得斯大林奖金的“列宁的生平”更是一部具体而生动的历史纪录。
    最后，我们还可以指出，联共（布）党与苏联政府对于电影事业的重视是史无前例的。在中央有电影事业部，大多数加盟共和国有自己的电影部，专门领导了这一工作的进行。在卫国战争的艰苦岁月中，也没有把它搁在一边。一年一度的斯大林文艺奖金，设有电影部门。（分为艺术电影与纪录电影），多少优秀的工作者获得了人民艺术家的称号并得到列宁奖章或红星奖章。而苏联电影工作者也不曾辜负了这种领导与扶植，以更好的工作成绩献给自己的祖国和人民。在卫国战争期间，牺牲于火线上的新闻摄影师的数目就有三十八人。
    大体说来，苏联电影就是这个样子的。今天，我们有了充分欣赏苏联电影的可能了。摆在我们面前的任务，无论对于电影工作者说，还是对于一般观众说，就是更好的在苏联电影中学习，学习我们所需要的各种各样的东西，以丰富我们自己。在学习中，我们也还有做进一步的系统的介绍与研究的必要。
