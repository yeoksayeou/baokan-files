　　Municipal Industry Bureau Director and Deputy Director
  　Inspect Public Factory Warehouses
  　Instructing Factories to Collect Scrap Materials for Allocation and Use
    [Beijing News] Mu Zexian, Director of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Industry Bureau, and Jia Tingsan, Deputy Director, have been inspecting the warehouses of public factories under their jurisdiction for several days, preparing to improve warehouse management systems and methods, and to establish a cost accounting system. During the inspection, in addition to checking documents and procedures such as finished product delivery notes and material requisition slips, they also inquired about the types and quantities of scrap materials, so as to make appropriate allocations among the factories. They also promptly corrected the phenomenon of individual warehouses not knowing how to properly protect state property. When inspecting the tram company's warehouse, Deputy Director Jia personally counted two "Xiao Bi" (tram parts) that had been newly purchased to see if the numbers matched. An inspection of the Waterworks Company's inventory revealed that, in addition to genuine scrap, there were many useful items. For example, more than four tons of alum stored since the switch to groundwater ten years ago, more than three hundred bicycle tires stored during the Japanese and Kuomintang rule, 1,800 catties of white hemp, more than 2,000 kilograms of vegetable oil, and 1,300 bags of cement had been left unmanaged and damaged, causing huge losses to the people's property. When Directors Mu and Jia went to the warehouses, they personally inspected the stored items and decided to handle them quickly. The bureau has now ordered all factories to collect scrap materials and report them to the bureau for allocation and use among the factories.

    【北京讯】京市人民政府工业局局长牟泽衔，副局长贾庭三，连日检查所属各公营工厂仓库，准备改善仓库保管制度方法，和建立成本会计制度。在检查时，除检查成品交库单、领料单等单据手续外，并询问废品的种类和存量。以便在各厂间作适当的调拨。并及时纠正了个别仓库对国家财产不知妥善保护等现象。在检查电车公司仓库时，贾局长亲自点数两罗新购的“肖鼻”（电车用零件），看数目是否相符。并检查出自来水公司的存品，除真正废料外，有许多有用的东西。例如自十年前改用地下水后存的四吨多白矾，日寇和国民党统治时期存的三百多条自行车带，一千八百斤白麻，两千多公斤植物油和一千三百袋洋灰等，都一直没人管理而捐坏，使人民财产蒙受巨大捐失。牟贾两局长到各仓库去时，都亲手翻检各项存物，决予迅速处理。现该局已令各厂收废料报局，以便在各厂间调拨使用。
