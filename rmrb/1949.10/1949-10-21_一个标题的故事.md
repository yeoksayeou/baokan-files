　　A Story of a Headline
    Xiao Yun
    We run a night school for female workers in Hong Kong, and also publish an irregular newspaper targeting female workers. The source of the articles is to encourage female workers to write themselves. We hope they will truthfully write about their lives, their suffering, and especially their experiences in struggle. We also solicit contributions from female workers with low levels of education, taking oral narrations and recording them for them. We try to publish all submissions that do not have special problems, and give prizes to encourage them. This approach has greatly encouraged the improvement of workers' cultural level.
    The articles rely on the workers to write, and the distribution also relies on them. Before each newspaper is published, we encourage everyone to love their newspaper and to use it to carry out political and cultural education to sisters in other factories, and also to reflect opinions from all sides as a guide for improving our work. Therefore, each night school student has four tasks: writing, distributing, educating, and reflecting opinions.
    The title of the newspaper is also very important. We once made such a mistake: Once, a worker read the story of "Prometheus" and wrote a post-reading reflection, which was vivid and meaningful. I thought it would be welcomed by the students, so I paid great attention to the title of this article. At that time, I thought of such a title: "Unveiling the Dark Canopy of Mankind." I felt that the title was very beautiful. When I asked other colleagues for their opinions, they also praised the beauty of the title.
    As a result, strangely enough, only two of the one hundred and twenty students read this article. When I asked them why they didn't read the article, they all said: We don't understand what "Unveiling the Dark Canopy of Mankind" means. Later, I asked a few students to read this article. They all said: They liked it, but the title was awkward, and asked me why I didn't just call it the story of the thief of fire or some other easy-to-understand title, but wrote one that was difficult for them to understand? This made me suddenly realize that it was too subjective to take the so-called "beautiful" sentences of intellectuals and stuff them into the masses of workers. In fact, that kind of symbolic sentence is not "beautiful" at all. We should try our best to choose lively and easy-to-understand language for the masses, that is the only way to achieve true beauty.

　　一个标题的故事
    小云
    我们在香港办女工夜校，同时还办了一种以女工做对象的不定期报纸。稿子的来源是动员女工自己写，我们希望她们忠实地写自己底生活，自己的痛苦，尤其是写斗争经验。文化水平低的女工我们也征稿，采取口头叙述，我们给她做记录，来稿只要没特殊问题，我们都尽量发表，而且发奖品给与鼓励，这种作法在提高工人文化上起了很大的鼓励作用。
    稿子靠工人写，发行也依靠她们，每次报纸发行前，我们都鼓动大家热爱自己的报纸，而且要通过这报纸向其他厂的姊妹们进行政治和文化教育，同时还要反映各方面的意见，作为我们工作中改进的指南，所以每个夜校的学生，她们有写稿、发行、教育、反映意见四个任务。
    办报纸标题也是很重要的，我们曾经有过这样的错误：有一次有个工人读了“普罗米修士”的故事写了一篇读后感，写得生动而有意义，我想一定会受同学的欢迎，所以我也就很注意这篇文章的标题，当时我想了这样一个题目“掀开了人类黑暗的天幕”，觉得这标题很美，当我去征求其他同事的意见时，她们也同声夸耀这标题的漂亮。
    结果，奇怪得很，这篇文章在一百二十个同学中只有两个人看了，我问她们为什么不看这篇文章时，她们都说：什么“掀开了人类黑暗的天幕”我们不懂。后来我叫几个同学看这篇文章，她们都说：喜欢，就是题目蹩扭，问我为什么不就叫偷火者的故事或是其他容易懂的标题，而写一个使她们不易懂的呢？这才使我恍然大悟，把知识分子所谓“漂亮”的句字拿去硬塞给工人群众，是太主观了。其实那种象征式的句字，也并不“漂亮”，我们要尽量选择生动活泼的大众易懂的语言，那才可能做到真正的漂亮。（附图片）
