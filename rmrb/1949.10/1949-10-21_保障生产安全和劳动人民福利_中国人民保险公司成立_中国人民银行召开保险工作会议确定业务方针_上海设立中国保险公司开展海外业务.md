　　To ensure production safety, improve the welfare of the working people, and protect state property, the People's Bank of China has decided to establish the People's Insurance Company of China. After more than a month of preparation, the head office of the company was officially established in Beijing on the 20th of this month. Regional companies will be established in each region (all located where the regional branches of the People's Bank of China are), and branch companies and offices will be established in major cities. The East China Regional Company in Shanghai, the directly affiliated branch in Tianjin, and the General Company's business department, which was reorganized from the original China Property Insurance Company in Beijing, also opened on the same day. In addition, the Central China Regional Company in Hankou, the Northwest Regional Company in Xi'an, and the Northeast Regional Company in Shenyang are planned to open on November 1st. The Southwest and South China Regional Companies are also in planning. The company's capital is set at 30 billion yuan, allocated by the People's Bank of China in one lump sum, and even greater support can be provided if necessary, so that the insurance company can provide adequate protection for the factories, machinery, raw materials, and products of production organizations, the material warehouses and transportation tools of trade departments, national construction equipment, and the personal welfare of workers. The types of business will initially include fire insurance, transportation insurance (including land, water, inland river, maritime, and air transportation), transportation war risk (such as explosion), group life insurance (i.e., group life insurance for staff of government agencies and enterprises), and planned services include passenger accident insurance, savings life insurance with value preservation, livestock insurance, agricultural insurance, etc. All public and private enterprises, government agencies, organizations, and people from all walks of life can apply for insurance from the company.

　　[Another Dispatch] The People's Bank of China convened a national insurance work conference in Beijing from September 25th to October 6th to prepare for the establishment of the People's Insurance Company of China. Responsible representatives engaged in insurance work from East China, Central China, Northwest China, Northeast China, Beijing, and Tianjin participated. The conference fully discussed the direction of the New Democratic insurance industry and clearly stipulated that insurance must also serve the basic policy of developing production. It also pointed out the three main tasks of the New Democratic national insurance undertaking: First, to ensure production safety, support the development of trade, and promote the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas; Second, to ensure the safety of the lives of the working people; Third, to protect state property. State-owned insurance companies should lead private insurance companies to operate together to achieve the above tasks, transform the purely profit-seeking view of private companies in the past, and various unreasonable business methods, and overcome the comprador nature of relying mainly on foreign imperialist companies in the past. In addition, due to the extreme fragility of China's insurance industry, the bureaucratic capital insurance companies during the Kuomintang's reactionary rule completely served the interests of the four major families, and therefore China's insurance industry was actually controlled by foreign imperialist forces, resulting in a serious outflow of rights and interests. After studying these situations, the National Insurance Work Conference determined that the construction of a strong state-owned insurance company should be the foundation domestically, uniting and transforming private companies. Regarding foreign countries, business should be developed mainly to meet the needs of international trade, and consideration should be given immediately to how to establish relations with the socialist country of the Soviet Union and new democratic countries that have already established diplomatic relations with us, and at the same time learn from their experience in building the insurance industry.

　　[Another Dispatch] In order to cooperate with the development of import and export trade, the People's Insurance Company of China has specially established the China Insurance Company on the basis of the original China Property Insurance Company that was taken over, specializing in handling foreign exchange insurance business. The China Insurance Company is a professional company directly under the leadership of the People's Insurance Company of China. Its institutions are mainly located in coastal ports. If international trade requires it in the future, it is also planned to establish branches abroad. The head office was established in Shanghai on the 20th of this month, and it is planned to establish branches in Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Xiamen, Qingdao, Tianjin, Yingkou, and overseas in Singapore, Manila, etc. The capital is 5 billion yuan, and it has already begun to handle marine transportation insurance business. The establishment of the People's Insurance Company of China and the China Insurance Company marks the construction of our nationwide state-owned insurance company and has established a strong national institution for the development of the New Democratic insurance undertaking.

　　保障生产安全和劳动人民福利
  　中国人民保险公司成立
    中国人民银行召开保险工作会议确定业务方针
    上海设立中国保险公司开展海外业务
    【华北讯】中国人民银行为保障生产安全，提高劳动人民福利，及保护国家财产，特决定设立中国人民保险公司。该公司经过一个多月的筹备，总公司已于本月二十日在北京正式成立。各区设立区公司（均设于中国人民银行区行所在地），各主要城市设立分公司及办事处。设在上海的华东区公司，天津的直属分公司，以及原北京中国产物保险公司改组的总公司营业部，亦于同日开业。此外，汉口之华中区公司，西安之西北区公司，沈阳之东北区公司，计划于十一月一日开业。西南及华南之区公司亦在筹划中，该公司资金定为三百亿元，由中国人民银行一次拨给，必要时还可作更大之支持，以使保险公司能对生产机构之厂房、机器、原料及产品、贸易部门之物资仓库、运输工具等，国家之建筑设备以及劳动者之人身福利有充足的保障。其业务总类，首先办理火灾保险、运输保险（包括陆路、水路、内河、航海、空运等）、运输兵险（如爆炸）、团体人寿保险（即机关与企业单位的工作人员之团体人寿保险），计划中的尚有乘客意外险，折实储蓄寿险，牲畜保险，农业保险等，凡公私企业、机关团体及各界人士均可向该公司投保。
    【又讯】中国人民银行为筹备中国人民保险公司之成立，曾于九月二十五日至十月六日在北京召开了全国保险工作会议。华东、华中、西北、东北、京、津均有从事保险工作之负责代表参加，大会对新民主主义保险事业的方向，作了充分的讨论，明确规定了保险也必须为发展生产服务的基本方针；并指出了新民主主义的国家保险事业的三个主要任务：一、保障生产安全，扶助贸易之发展，促进城乡物资交流；二、保障劳动人民生活之安全；三、保护国家财产。国营保险公司应领导私营保险公司共同为实现上述任务而经营，必须改造过去私营公司单纯的营利观点，与各种不合理的经营方法，必须克服过去主要的是依赖帝国主义外商公司的买办性。此外由于中国保险业的十分脆弱，国民党反动统治时代的官僚资本的保险公司，又完全是为四大家族的利益服务，因之中国的保险事业实际是为外国帝国主义势力所控制，造成严重的利权外溢。全国保险工作会议在研究了这些情况之后，确定国内是以建设强大的国营保险公司为基础，团结与改造私营公司：对国外则主要的服从国际贸易的需要开展业务，目前应即考虑与已经与我建立外交关系的社会主义国家苏联及新民主主义国家如何建立关系，同时向他们学习建设保险事业的经验。　　　　　　　　　（华新室）
    【又息】中国人民保险公司为了配合发展出入口贸易，特以原接收之中国产物保险公司为基础，另设立中国保险公司，专门办理有关外汇保险业务，中国保险公司即为中国人民保险公司直接领导下的一个专业公司，其机构主要是设在沿海口岸，将来国际贸易有必要时，并拟在国外增设分支机构，现总公司已于本月二十日在上海成立，并计划在广州、香港、厦门、青岛、天津、营口及海外星加坡、马尼剌等地设立分公司，资金为五十亿元，目前已开始办理海路运输保险业务，中国人民保险公司与中国保险公司之成立，标帜着我们全国规模国营保险公司的建设，为新民主义保险事业的发展，建立了强大的国家机构。
