Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 6th: The following is the full text of the report delivered by Liu Shaoqi, President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, at the inaugural meeting of the association on the 5th:

　　Fellow representatives, esteemed guests!

　　The people of our two great nations, China and the Soviet Union, have clearly demonstrated through the history of the past thirty years that they love each other like brothers.

　　More than thirty years ago, the Russian Imperial Government's policy of aggression against China aroused resistance from the Chinese people, and this resistance was entirely justified. However, since the overthrow of the Russian Imperial Government and the victory of the October Revolution, the situation has completely changed. Under the leadership of the great Lenin and Stalin, the Soviet people have implemented an unprecedentedly friendly policy towards the Chinese people, and the Chinese people have begun to accept the friendship of the Soviet people and the Soviet government with an unprecedentedly friendly attitude.

　　The success of the great October Revolution gave immense hope to all mankind, including the oppressed Chinese people. As Comrade Stalin said, "The October Revolution greatly promoted the liberation cause of the oppressed nations in the West and the East, ... building a bridge between the socialist West and the enslaved East." It was precisely because of the call of the October Revolution that the advanced elements of China obtained Marxism-Leninism as a weapon from their long exploration, and used this weapon to earnestly analyze and solve the problems of China. Thus, the Communist Party of China was born in 1921, which gave a completely new look to the Chinese revolution.

　　Sun Yat-sen, who led the Xinhai Revolution, understood this historical development. Disappointed by the reality of old China and the old-style Anglo-American democracy, he welcomed the October Revolution and the Communist Party of China, and thus established the three major policies of alliance with Russia, cooperation with the Communist Party, and assistance to peasants and workers in 1924. At this time, the Soviet government automatically abolished all its privileges in China, abolished all unequal treaties concluded between the Tsarist era and the old Chinese government, and gave truly friendly assistance to Sun Yat-sen and the then revolutionary government. Thanks to this assistance, the revolutionary Northern Expedition was victoriously launched. In March 1925, on his deathbed, Mr. Sun Yat-sen left a will to his successors, earnestly admonishing them to "unite with those nations in the world that treat us equally to fight together." This meant uniting with the Soviet Union.

　　However, after the death of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, his will was completely betrayed by his successor, the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique. In 1927, when the Chinese revolution was gaining brilliant victories under the cooperation of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and the assistance of the Soviet Union, Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the Chinese revolution, betrayed the Chinese people, and betrayed Mr. Sun Yat-sen. He transformed the alliance with Russia and the Communist Party into anti-Soviet and anti-Communist activities, and turned the assistance to peasants and workers into the destruction of peasants and workers, and launched a cruel ten-year civil war. The Chiang Kai-shek clique turned into a running dog of imperialism and a representative of the interests of the feudal comprador class. Friendship and cooperation between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union were seriously hindered and damaged.

　　But in 1937, when Japanese imperialism armed invaded China and the Chinese War of Resistance against Japan broke out, the Soviet Union, without bearing old grudges, took the lead in providing manpower and material assistance to China's resistance against Japan. After the victory in the European war, the Soviet Union, despite suffering great damage, quickly joined the war against Japan, eliminated the Japanese Kwantung Army, and helped China liberate the Northeast. During this People's Liberation War, the Soviet Union provided our Northeast Liberated Area with trade convenience. In particular, due to the powerful existence of the Soviet Union and the development of world people's democratic forces, the great strength of imperialism was restrained, which enabled the Chinese People's Liberation War to be won quickly.

　　Now the Chinese People's Liberation War and the People's Great Revolution have achieved basic victory and will soon achieve complete victory. The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has been convened, and the establishment of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China was announced on October 1 this year. The Soviet Union was the first to recognize the Chinese People's Government and establish new diplomatic relations on the second day after the declaration of the establishment of our People's Republic of China.

　　For the past thirty years, the above facts have proven that the Soviet people and the Soviet government's love for the Chinese people has been unwavering.

　　In his will to the Soviet Union on his deathbed, Mr. Sun Yat-sen said: "I hope that dawn is approaching soon, and at that time, the Soviet Union will welcome a strong and independent China as a good friend and ally. The two countries will join hands in the great battle for the freedom of the world's oppressed nations to achieve victory." It can be said that Mr. Sun Yat-sen's hope has not only dawned today, but has also completely become a reality. Chinese history has since entered a completely new era, which has also made the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people enter a completely new era. Now there is no force in the world that can prevent or destroy the friendship and cooperation between our two peoples. The friendship and cooperation between our two peoples can be infinitely developed and consolidated from now on. The close cooperation between our two great nations will be invincible in the world and will have a decisive impact on the future development of the world. Therefore, the close cooperation between our two great nations is one of the greatest interests of mankind in the world, especially the greatest interests of our Chinese people. Therefore, we attach great importance to and cherish this friendship and cooperation. We cannot allow any behavior that destroys or hinders this friendship and cooperation, because this behavior violates the greatest interests of the vast majority of the Chinese people.

　　China is an economically backward country, with industrial production accounting for only one-tenth of total production. Now China's economy has been greatly damaged. The primary task of the Chinese people today is to rapidly restore and develop China's people's economy and industrialize China. However, without the full friendly assistance of the Soviet people and the Soviet government, it would be much more difficult. For example, the rapid restoration of our railways has been aided by the Soviet Union. The restoration of iron and steel industries such as Anshan and Shijingshan will be much faster with the help of the Soviet Union. Therefore, the Soviet Union's sincere friendly assistance to the Chinese people is one of the favorable conditions for restoring and developing China's economy. For this reason, the Chinese people should pay special attention to and cherish friendship and cooperation with the Soviet people.

　　In addition to this, we attach special importance to and cherish the friendship and cooperation between the people of China and the Soviet Union because the Soviet people are people educated and cultivated by the great Lenin and Stalin. These people have infinitely sincere internationalist friendship and love for the Chinese people and even the people of the world. Their help to the Chinese people is unconditional and does not require repayment, just as our Chinese Communists serve the people unconditionally and without asking for reward. This spirit of internationalist friendship and love is incomprehensible to people with old bourgeois viewpoints. For example, when we used to go to factories or rural areas to serve workers and peasants, people often looked at us with strange eyes when they saw us doing things for them without asking for any reward, not afraid of trouble, hardship, or danger, because they had never seen such selfless people who could serve the people unconditionally. The Soviet Communists and the Soviet people, like the Chinese Communists, are selfless and can unconditionally serve the Chinese people. Because the world's Communists, including our Chinese Communists, are a completely new kind of people in the world, people who have never existed in the past, people who have infinitely sincere internationalist friendship and love, and can unconditionally and indiscriminately serve the people anywhere in the world. Comrade Mao Zedong said: True friendly help can only be found from the Soviet Union. This is the reason.

　　For example, the Soviet Union has now sent more than two hundred experts to serve in the Northeast and China. I once asked them about the conditions for serving in China. They said: Stalin, at the request of the Chinese Communist Party, sent them to serve in China and instructed them to tell the Chinese all their knowledge and skills. When the Chinese can learn and manage their factories and enterprises without difficulty and without needing them to serve in China, they will return to the Soviet Union. When they come to China, China assigns them their work. When they are assigned to various factories, enterprises, and economic organs, they work under the leadership of the Chinese负责人 (person in charge) of each factory, enterprise, and organ. They only act as consultants. Their salaries are only the same as those of Chinese engineers, not the very high salaries of British and American engineers. These working conditions in China are unprecedented for foreign engineers in the past. Only Soviet experts automatically propose these conditions. Commerce between the Soviet Union and China has already begun. The trade conditions proposed by the Soviet Union are also completely friendly and self-denying, which are impossible for other capitalist countries. These are some concrete manifestations of the Soviet people's internationalist spirit.

　　We attach special importance to and cherish the friendship and cooperation between the people of China and the Soviet Union because the path taken by the Soviet people is exactly the path that our Chinese people will take. The experience of the Soviet people in building the country is worth learning well by the Chinese people. In the past, our Chinese people's revolution was able to achieve today's victory by learning from the Soviet Union, "taking Russia as a teacher." In the future, we must also "take Russia as a teacher" and learn from the Soviet people's experience in building the country. Now the Soviet Union has many completely new scientific knowledge that does not exist in the world. We can only learn this scientific knowledge from the Soviet Union. For example, economics, banking, finance, commerce, education, etc., all have a completely new set of theories in the Soviet Union that does not exist in other countries in the world. As for the Soviet Union's advanced political science and military science, that goes without saying. Soviet culture is completely new culture. Absorbing Soviet new culture as a guide for our construction of a new China is the current urgent task of the Chinese people. Therefore, we especially need the friendly assistance and cooperation of the Soviet people.

　　Thirty-two years ago, Russia was still a backward country. But now the situation has changed. Russia is no longer a backward country, but an advanced country. Not only is its political system and military system the most advanced in the world, but the Soviet Union's science and technology have also caught up with and surpassed the most advanced countries in the world. The view that some Chinese people believe that Russia is still backward must be corrected. Correcting this view will enable the Chinese people to learn widely from the Soviet Union without hindrance.

　　The industrialization of capitalist countries takes more than a hundred years, but the industrialization of the Soviet Union only takes twenty or thirty years. Because we have the Soviet Union's internationalist assistance to the Chinese people, we can also achieve industrialization in China within twenty years. Therefore, the close friendship and cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet people is a particularly important and precious event.

　　Since the friendship and cooperation between the people of China and the Soviet Union is of such great significance, our enemies—the imperialists and reactionaries—cannot fail to see it. Therefore, they will inevitably focus their attention on destroying this friendship and cooperation. They are using various methods, such as rumors, instigation, enticement, slander, etc., to destroy it, trying to arouse suspicion and division between our two peoples. This is something we must be vigilant about.

　　For these reasons, we, representing the will of the entire Chinese people, have carried out the preparatory work for the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, the purpose of which is to enhance and consolidate the brotherly friendship and cooperation between the people of China and the Soviet Union and promote the exchange of all wisdom and experience between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union. Our General Association has decided to be located in the new people's capital, Beijing, and will establish general branches, branches, and sub-branches throughout the country. The General Association has been prepared and is announced today. Some general branches, branches, and sub-branches in various places have been established, such as in the Northeast, and some are being prepared and will be established soon. The enthusiastic participation of the masses of people in this association proves that the Chinese people very sincerely and urgently need to cooperate closely with the Soviet people.

　　We are very honored to have the Soviet cultural, artistic, and scientific workers delegation led by Comrades Fadeyev and Simonov participating in today's inaugural meeting. This symbolizes that today's meeting is a true "Sino-Soviet Friendship" grand unity. Comrades Soviet led by Comrades Fadeyev and Simonov, you have participated in our founding ceremony on October 1, the Chinese Conference for the Defense of World Peace on the 2nd and 3rd, and today you are honored to participate in the inaugural meeting of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. You are very good international friends during our founding period. You must have seen the common aspirations of our Chinese people: Sino-Soviet friendship and the work of defending world peace are inseparable, and they are also inseparable from our nation-building work. One of the major events during our founding period is to strengthen Sino-Soviet friendship and defend world peace.

　　Here, we respectfully wish the Soviet delegation and other international representatives good helath, and wish the conference success.

　　Long live the great Chinese people!

　　Long live the great Soviet people！

　　Long live the immortal friendship and cooperation between the people of China and the Soviet Union!

　　Long live the great revolutionary teacher of the working people of the world, Marshal Stalin!

　　中苏友好协会成立大会上
    刘少奇会长报告全文
    【新华社北京六日电】中苏友好协会总会会长刘少奇五日在中苏友好协会成立大会上的报告全文如下：
    各位代表，各位来宾们！
    我们中苏两大国的人民，由最近三十年来的历史清楚地证明：是如象兄弟一样地相互友爱的。
    在三十多年以前，由于俄皇政府实行侵略中国的政策，曾经引起了中国人民的反抗，这种反抗是完全正当的。但自俄皇政府被推翻，十月革命胜利之后，情形就完全改变了，苏联人民就在伟大的列宁和斯大林领导之下对中国人民实行了从来未有的友好的政策，而中国的人民也就开始以从来未有的友好态度来接受苏联人民和苏联政府的友好。
    伟大的十月革命的成功，给了全人类同样也给了被压迫的中国人民以极大的希望，诚如斯大林同志所说：“十月革命，大大促进了西方和东方的被压迫民族的解放事业，…………在社会主义的西方和被奴役的东方之间架起了一道桥梁”。正因为十月革命的感召，我们中国的先进分子才从长期的摸索中获得了马克思列宁主义这个武器，并用这个武器来认真地分析与解决中国问题。于是在一九二一年就产生了中国共产党，并使中国革命的面貌为之一新。
    这一历史的发展，领导过辛亥革命的孙中山先生是理解的。他在旧中国的现实和英美式的旧民主主义中感到失望之余，欢迎了十月革命和中国共产党，因而在一九二四年便有了联俄，联共和援助农工的三大政策的建立。在这种时候，苏联政府自动取消了在中国的一切特权，废除了帝俄时代和中国旧政府间缔结的一切不平等条约，并对孙中山及当时的革命政府给了真正友谊的帮助。正由于有了这些帮助，革命的北伐战争乃得胜利的举行。在一九二五年三月孙中山先生临终时留下了遗嘱给他的后继者们，谆谆告诫，必须“联合世界上以平等待我之民族共同奋斗。”这就是说必须联合苏联。
    但是，在孙中山先生去世以后，他的遗嘱便完全被他的后继者蒋介石反动集团所背叛了。在一九二七年，中国的大革命在国共合作与苏联援助之下正获得辉煌胜利的中途，蒋介石出卖了中国革命，出卖了中国人民，出卖了孙中山先生，由联俄、联共一变而为反苏、反共，由援助农工一变而为摧残农工，并举行了残酷的十年内战，蒋介石集团成了帝国主义的走狗，封建买办阶级利益的代表人，中苏两大民族的友谊与合作，受到了严重的阻碍与破坏。
    但在一九三七年，日本帝国主义武装侵入中国，中国的抗日战争爆发，苏联仍是不念旧恶地首先以人力物力援助中国抗战。又在欧洲战争获得胜利以后，苏联尽管遭受了很大的破坏，仍然是很快地参加了对日战争，消灭日本关东军帮助中国解放了东北。在这一次人民解放战争中间，苏联又给我东北解放区以通商的便利。特别是由于苏联的强大存在和世界人民民主力量的发展，牵制了帝国主义很大的力量，因而就使得中国人民解放战争能够很快地获得胜利。
    现在中国人民解放战争和人民大革命已经获得基本的胜利，很快就要获得完全的胜利，中国人民政治协商会议已经召开，在今年十月一日已经宣告了中华人民共和国中央人民政府的成立。苏联在我中华人民共和国宣告成立的第二天，就首先承认了中国人民政府并建立了新的外交关系。
    三十年来，由于以上这些事实，证明苏联人民和苏联政府对中国人民的友爱是始终不渝的。
    孙中山先生在他临终时给苏联的遗书上说：“希望不久即将破晓，斯时苏联以良友及盟国来欢迎强盛独立之中国，两国在争世界被压迫民族自由之大战中，携手并进，以取得胜利”。可以说，孙中山先生所怀抱的这个希望，在今天不独是已经破晓，而且完全变为现实了，中国历史从此已经进入一个完全新的时代，这也就使中苏两国人民的友谊进入一个完全新的时代，现在世界上已经没有一种力量能够阻止与破坏我们两国人民的友谊与合作了，我们两国人民的友谊与合作，从此可以无限量地发展和巩固起来了。我们两大民族的亲密合作，在世界上将是无敌的，对于世界今后的发展方向将要发生决定的作用。因此，我们两大民族的亲密合作，乃是世界人类的最大利益之一，特别是我们中国人民的最大利益。因此，我们十分重视和珍贵这种友谊与合作，任何破坏和阻碍这种友谊与合作的行为，我们是不能允许的，因为这种行为违背中国最大多数人民的最大利益。
    中国是一个经济落后的国家，工业生产只占总生产的十分之一，现在中国的经济又受到了极大的破坏，今天中国人民的首要任务，就是要迅速恢复和发展中国的人民经济，使中国工业化。但是，如果没有苏联人民和苏联政府的完全友谊的帮助，那是要困难得多的。例如：我们铁路的很快恢复，就得到了苏联的帮助。又如鞍山、石景山等钢铁工业的恢复，有了苏联的帮助，就要快得多，所以苏联对中国人民的真诚友谊的帮助，是恢复和发展中国经济的有利条件之一。由于这样的原因，中国人民应该特别重视和珍贵对苏联人民的友谊与合作。
    除此以外，我们之所以特别重视与珍贵中苏两国人民的友谊与合作，还因为苏联人民是在伟大的列宁和斯大林的教育培养之下的人民。这种人民对我们中国人民以至全世界的人民是具有无限真诚的国际主义的友爱的。他们对中国人民的帮助是无条件的，不要求报酬的。正如我们中国共产党人为人民服务是无条件的不要求报酬的一样。这种国际主义的友爱精神，是具有旧的资产阶级观点的人所不能理解的。例如，我们在以前的时候到工厂或农村中去为工人农民服务，人们看到我们那种不怕麻烦、不畏艰苦、不怕危险地替他们办事而不要求任何报酬的时候，人们就常常用一种奇怪的眼光看待我们，因为他们从来没有看见过这样一种大公无私的人，能够这样无条件地为人民服务。苏联的共产党人和苏联的人民也和中国共产党人一样，是大公无私的，能够无条件地为中国人民服务的。因为世界上的共产党人，我们中国的共产党人也在内，是世界上一种完全新的人物，在过去历史上没有过的人物，这种人物是具有无限真诚的国际主义友爱精神的，能够无条件地、无分别地为世界任何地方的人民服务。毛泽东同志说：真正友谊的帮助，只能从苏联这一方面去找。正是这个道理。
    譬如说吧，现在苏联已经派了两百多位专家到东北和中国来服务，我曾经问过他们在中国服务的条件，他们说：斯大林应中国共产党之请派遣他们到中国来服务，指示他们要把他们所有的一切知识和技能告诉中国人，什么时候中国人能够学会，能够没有困难地管理他们的工厂和企业，而不需要他们在中国服务的时候，他们就回苏联去。他们来到中国，由中国分配他们的工作，在他们被分配到各工厂、各企业和各经济机关去的时候，他们在各工厂、企业和机关的中国负责人领导之下工作，他们只做顾问，他们的薪资，只领取和中国同等工程师一样的薪资，而不是如英国美国工程师一样，领取很高的薪资。他们在中国的这些工作条件，是过去外国工程师从来没有过的，只有苏联的专家才自动提出这些条件。苏联与中国的商业，现已开始进行，苏联所提出的通商条件，也是完全友谊的和克己的，是其他资本主义国家所不能有的。这就是苏联人民国际主义精神的一些具体表现。
    我们之所以特别重视与珍贵中苏两国人民的友谊与合作，还因为苏联人民所走过的道路正是我们中国人民将要走的道路。苏联人民建国的经验值得我们中国人民很好地学习。我们中国人民的革命，在过去就是学习苏联，“以俄为师”，所以能够获得今天这样的胜利。在今后我们要建国，同样也必须“以俄为师”，学习苏联人民的建国经验。现在苏联有许多世界上所没有的完全新的科学知识，我们只有从苏联才能学到这些科学知识。例如：经济学、银行学、财政学、商业学、教育学等等，在苏联都有完全新的一套理论，为世界其他国家所没有的。至于苏联进步的政治科学与军事科学那就更不待说了。苏联的文化完全是新的文化。吸收苏联新的文化做为我们建设新中国的指针是中国人民目前的迫切任务。因此我们特别需要苏联人民的友谊的帮助与合作。
    在三十二年以前俄国还是一个落后的国家。但是到现在这种情况变化了，俄国已经不是落后的国家，而是一个先进的国家了，不只是它的政治制度、军事制度是世界上最进步的，而且苏联的科学和技术也已经赶上和超过了世界上最先进的国家。有一部分中国人认为俄国还是落后的观点，必须改正。改正这种观点，才能使中国人民无阻碍地广泛地向苏联学习。
    资本主义国家的工业化，需要一百多年的时间，但是苏联工业化就只需要二三十年。我们中国工业化，因为我们有了苏联对于中国人民的国际主义的帮助，我们也可能在二十年之内达到。因此中国人民和苏联人民亲密的友谊与合作。乃是特别值得重视与珍贵的事件。
    中苏两国人民的友谊与合作，既有如此重大的意义，我们的敌人——帝国主义者和反动派不是看不到的，因此他们就必然要集中注意来破坏我们这种友谊与合作，他们正用各种方法，例如造谣、挑拨、引诱、中伤等等来破坏，企图引起我们两国人民之间的猜疑和分裂，这是我们必须加以警惕的。
    正由于以上这些原因，我们代表全中国人民的意志，进行了中苏友好协会的筹备工作，其目的就是要增进与巩固中苏两国人民的兄弟般的友谊和合作，促进中苏两大民族的一切智慧和经验的交流。我们的总会决定设在新的人民首都北京，并将在全国各地设立总分会，分会和支会。总会已经筹备就绪，在今天宣告成立。各地总分会，分会和支会，有的已经成立，如象东北，有的正在筹备中，即将成立。各地人民群众踊跃参加本会的事实，证明了中国人民非常恳挚而迫切地需要和苏联人民密切合作。
    我们很荣幸，在今天的成立大会上，有了法捷耶夫同志和西蒙诺夫同志所领导的苏联文化艺术科学工作者代表团参加，这就象征了我们今天的大会是真正的“中苏友好”的大团结。法捷耶夫同志和西蒙诺夫同志所率领的各位苏联同志们，你们已经参加了十月一日我们的开国典礼，二日和三日的中国保卫世界和平大会，今天又承蒙你们来参加中苏友好协会总会的成立大会，你们便是我们开国时期的很好的国际朋友。你们一定已经看出我们中国人民的共同志趣：中苏友好和保卫世界和平的工作是分不开的，和我们的建国工作也是分不开的，我们开国时期的大事件之一，便是要加强中苏友好，保卫世界和平。
    在这里我们敬祝苏联代表团和其他国际代表的健康，敬祝大会的成功。
    伟大的中国人民万岁！
    伟大的苏联人民万岁！
    中苏两国人民永远不朽的友谊与合作万岁！
    伟大的全世界劳动人民的革命导师斯大林大元帅万岁！
