　　“Plow the Land This Autumn, Harvest More Grain Next Year”
     Zhai Yuzi
    (I)
    The experience of autumn plowing, accumulated over thousands of years, is widely circulated in rural areas. Agricultural proverbs say: "An eighty-year-old man doesn't forget to plow the land in autumn, and a good woman doesn't forget to add fertilizer during the hot season." "Don't slack off in autumn plowing, slacking off will waste effort." "Autumn plowing an inch deep is better than a layer of manure." "Scratching the surface in autumn is better than plowing several times in the spring." "If you don't plow the land after the autumn harvest, you won't be able to decide what to do in the spring."
    Why do farmers attach so much importance to autumn plowing? Because:
    (1) Autumn plowing can reduce pests - many insects burrow into the soil to pupate, lay eggs, or overwinter as adults; once plowed in the autumn, they are turned to the surface, where sun, wind, birds, and frost can destroy most of them.
    (2) Autumn plowing can reduce weeds and increase soil fertility - after the autumn harvest, there are many weeds. If these weeds are plowed into the ground early, they can increase soil fertility and reduce their consumption of soil nutrients and water. At the same time, in the early-plowed land, some weed seeds and crop seeds can be turned into the soil, germinate, and emerge, and be completely frozen to death by the winter frost, reducing weed damage in the coming year.
    (3) It's easier to plant seedlings next year - autumn plowing allows the underground water and winter rain and snow to be largely preserved, reducing evaporation and loss, which facilitates timely sowing and planting of seedlings in the coming spring. In North China, nine out of ten years are prone to spring drought, so spring sowing and early sowing are often delayed. If the land has been plowed in the autumn, even if there is a spring drought next year, a small rain will allow timely early sowing; if the land has not been plowed in the autumn, we will have to wait for a heavy rain to plow the land, or it will be difficult to sow and germinate after plowing, and we cannot sow in time while waiting for rain.
    (II)
    This year's autumn plowing has unprecedented advantages: the environment is stable, and the rural labor and livestock can be devoted to agricultural production and construction. There has been more autumn rain this year, which is convenient for planting wheat and also facilitates autumn plowing; after the land has been equally distributed, land rights have been determined in most areas, and the people's enthusiasm for production has been unprecedentedly high. As long as we lead properly, it is entirely possible to complete the task of plowing through all the land once this year. However, there are considerable difficulties due to the lack of labor and livestock. The following are some experiences in overcoming the difficulties of labor and livestock for local reference:
    (1) Advocate free "joint plowing" and "selling plowing". Our existing livestock power is not strong enough. To plow deeply, we must implement "joint plowing." For example, several households with livestock can jointly plow, and after their own plowing, they can also sell plowing (that is, use livestock to do short-term work). Many areas have this custom among farmers. This method can be well controlled and led, and forced orders are strictly prohibited.
    (2) Implement the exchange of human and livestock labor: If there is livestock but no people, or people but no livestock, both parties can help each other on a voluntary basis, or exchange work at equal value. In addition, when livestock are weak, they can be combined with a human labor force to plow together to strive for deep plowing.
    (3) Organize human labor to jointly plow: Those who truly have no livestock should combine several households to use human labor for three-way plowing. Farmers in Quyang County, Hebei Province, already have this custom, and the people of Quyang call it "three-in-one." This is naturally much worse than animal plowing, but it is much better than not plowing.
    (4) Vigorously organize and mobilize women and children to participate in autumn plowing, and also organize human power to dig and shovel, and carry out the autumn plowing movement, striving to achieve a complete plowing of all land.

　　“今年秋耕地，明年多打粮”
     翟雨滋
    （一）
    几千年来的秋耕经验，在农村中到处流传着。农谚有：“八十老汉不忘秋耕地，好妇女不忘伏纳底。”“秋耕别放松，放松就费工。”“秋耕深一寸，顶上一层粪。”“秋天划破皮，强如来春犁几犁。”“收秋不耕地，来春不能定主意。”
    为什么农民这样重视秋耕呢？因为：
    （一）秋耕可减少虫害——好多虫子是钻到土里变蛹，产卵或以成虫形态在土里过冬的；一经秋耕，翻上地面，日晒、风吹、鸟食、冰冻，可毁灭大部。
    （二）秋耕可减少杂草，增加土肥——秋田收获后，有不少杂草，这些杂草若很早耕起翻入地里，既可增加土肥，又可减少其消耗土壤养分与水分；同时早耕的地，一些杂草种子和作物种子翻入土中可发芽出土，一经冬霜，全部冻死，减少来年杂草为害。
    （三）明年好按苗——秋耕可使地下水分和冬季的雨雪可以大部的保存起来，减少蒸发流失，便于来年春天及时播种按苗。华北十年有九年要春旱，所以常常误了春播和早播。如秋耕了的地，明年即或春旱，遇有一场小雨，就可及时提早播种；没有秋耕的地，来春非等大雨耕不动，或者是耕后播种也难出苗，为了等雨就不能及时播种。
    （二）
    今年的秋耕，具有十几年来未有的优越条件：环境安定，农村的人力畜力可以专力从事农业生产建设，今年秋雨较多，便利种麦，也便利了秋耕；土地平分后，大部地区地权业已确定，人民生产情绪空前提高。今年的秋耕工作，只要我们领导得当，完成普耕一遍的任务，是完全可能的。但是由于劳畜力的缺乏，也有相当困难。在克服劳畜力困难上有以下几点经验可供各地参考：
    （一）提倡自由“合犋”和“卖犋”。我们现有的畜力，力量是不够强大的，要想深耕，必须实行“合犋”。如有牲口户几户合犋合伙耕，自己耕种后还可卖犋（即以畜力打短工），不少地区农民已有这种习惯，这种办法可很好掌握领导，严禁强迫命令。
    （二）实行人畜力工交换法：如有牲口没人，有人没牲口的户，双方在自愿的原则下，可相互帮忙，或等价换工进行。另外牲口弱小时，可结合上一个人力合耕，力求深耕。
    （三）组织人力合伙合耕：真正无畜力者就要几户合伙用人力三合耕，这种办法在河北省曲阳县农民已有习惯，曲阳人民叫它“三合一”。这自然比起畜耕是差的多，但比不耕也强得多。
    （四）大力组织动员妇女儿童，参加秋耕，还可组织人力镐刨锹翻，开展秋耕运动，力求达到普耕一遍。
