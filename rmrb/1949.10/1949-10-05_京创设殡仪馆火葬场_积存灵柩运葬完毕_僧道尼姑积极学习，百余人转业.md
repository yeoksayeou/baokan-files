[Beijing News] Since June, the Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau has been conducting investigations into temples in the city, clearing accumulated coffins, and establishing funeral parlors and crematories. It has also begun to lead monks, nuns, and Taoists in the city and suburbs in political and cultural studies, while guiding them to gradually transition to labor production. The investigation of temples in the city and suburbs was completed by the end of July. Excluding mosques and Lama temples, there are a total of 654 temples with 1,239 monks, Taoists, and nuns. The investigation of temples in the suburbs began in August and is still ongoing. Concurrent with the investigation of temples in the city and suburbs, the Civil Affairs Bureau investigated the accumulated coffins in temples in the city and suburbs in early June. Subsequently, it mobilized monks, nuns, and Taoists from various temples and persuaded coffin-storing households to begin clearing and burying them. By mid-August, most had been cleared and buried by the coffin-storing households themselves. The remaining 612 unclaimed coffins or those whose owners were unable to bury them were subsidized with 2,000 catties of millet by the Civil Affairs Bureau, which mobilized monks and workers from various temples to bury them. By mid-September, all 2,796 coffins stored in temples in the city and suburbs had been cleared and buried, freeing up 1,290 rooms. This reform of the habit of some citizens keeping coffins for extended periods without burial has had a significant impact on improving public health and the environment. In conjunction with the work of clearing and burying coffins, the Civil Affairs Bureau, in order to facilitate funeral arrangements for citizens, promote thrift and hygiene, and reform the city's funeral customs, drafted the "Provisional Regulations for the Establishment of Funeral Parlors in Beijing" and the "Provisional Regulations for the Establishment of Public Cemeteries and Crematories in Beijing" in early June. After being submitted to the Municipal Government for approval, they were promulgated and implemented by the Municipal Government on August 10th, stipulating that all funeral parlors, crematories, and public cemeteries in the city should be directly managed by the Civil Affairs Bureau, and related health matters should be subject to the guidance of the Health Bureau. In mid-August, the Civil Affairs Bureau, together with the Health Bureau, convened a symposium of abbots of relevant temples to formulate the articles of association for funeral parlors and crematories. At the same time, it approved six funeral parlors, including Bailin Temple, Jiaxing Temple, Fayuan Temple, Xizhao Temple, and Guanyin Temple, and three crematories, including Nianhua Temple, Guangji Temple, and Cihui Temple. In addition, the Civil Affairs Bureau has decided to establish five public cemeteries in the suburbs of the city and is currently actively preparing for them. During the implementation of the above-mentioned tasks, the Civil Affairs Bureau has repeatedly convened symposiums with monks and nuns, calling on them to turn to production and engage in political and cultural studies. Over the past few months, with the assistance of comrades from the Civil Affairs Bureau, most of the monks, Taoists, and nuns in the city have begun to change their views on life and have initially established the concept of labor. The vast majority have participated in production and started studying. As of now, 106 people have voluntarily returned to secular life and changed professions. Fifteen people have been recommended by the Civil Affairs Bureau to enter China University, Revolutionary University, and Military University. Among them, Cong Tang, who returned to his hometown to farm, and Jing Yuan, who independently entered Revolutionary University, have respectively donated approximately 230 rooms of Zhenwu Temple, Xiangjie Temple, Baozhu Cave, Jixiang Nunnery, and Sanshan Nunnery under their jurisdiction to the government. Jing Yuan also donated a rare edition of the Dragon Canon from the four temples she donated, which has been transferred to the Beijing Library by the Civil Affairs Bureau. In terms of production, ten temples have formed formal production units, with about 100 people (including a few workers) participating in this organized production activity. Among them, the Civil Affairs Bureau regularly provides guidance to Changchun Temple, which weaves towels, and Guanghua Temple, which fluffs cotton. In addition, more than 50% of all monks, Taoists, and nuns have participated in various sporadic production activities, such as pedaling tricycles, doing odd jobs for factories, pasting matchboxes, sewing sock tops, and making shoe soles. In terms of learning, Fayuan Temple, Guanghui Temple, Cuifeng Temple, and Hongshan Temple have formed study groups to study "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party" and "A New Outlook on Life." With the assistance of comrades from the Civil Affairs Bureau, the enthusiasm for learning has reached an unprecedented high. Their autobiographies are filled with words expressing their desire for progress, such as: "Now I use my mind every day to study how to reform my way of life and not be a laggard in this great era," "I am willing to go to society to serve the broad masses of the people and not be a parasite on society," "From now on, I am determined to study and must reform our past decadence and establish a new outlook on life."
