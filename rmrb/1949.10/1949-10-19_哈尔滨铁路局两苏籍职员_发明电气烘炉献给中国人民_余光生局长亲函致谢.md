Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 18th—Two Soviet employees of the Harbin Railway Bureau invent electric oven, Dedicated to the Chinese People; Bureau Chief Yu Guangsheng Sends Personal Letter of Thanks.

    【Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 18th】To express the great friendship between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union, Laumanov, the Soviet section chief of the Harbin Inspection Section of the Harbin Railway Administration, and Sjiebanov, the Soviet head of the Electrical Section of the Bureau's Mechanical Department, dedicated the electric oven for heating rivets that they invented to the Chinese people. Now, the Northeast Railway Administration has decided to issue a circular for announcement. It will first be used on a trial basis by the Harbin Inspection Section before being promoted to relevant factories and sections throughout the railway. It has also been decided to award Laumanov and Sjiebanov each a bonus of 5 million yuan and a medal. Yu Guangsheng, Director of the Northeast Railway Administration, also personally wrote to them to express his gratitude.

    After the electric oven was manufactured by the Harbin Railway Factory, the test results were very good. The main features are: it has lightweight wheels and can be pushed at any time; it can be used anywhere with electricity; it saves coal and does not require dedicated personnel to guard it; only one riveter is needed to carry out the work. Rivets with a diameter of 1/2 inch to 1 inch and a length of 1 inch to 3 inches can be heated in 10 seconds to 1 minute. The rivets heated by the oven do not contain slag. The voltage is only 1.5 to 2.5 volts, posing no danger to the workers. Electricity is only used when heating the rivets, which saves a lot of power. At the same time, it does not produce smoke or coal dust, which can ensure the health of the workers. It is equipped with a feedback regulator, which can adjust the heating speed at any time.

　　哈尔滨铁路局两苏籍职员
  　发明电气烘炉
  　献给中国人民
    余光生局长亲函致谢
    【新华社沈阳十八日电】哈尔滨铁路管理局哈尔滨检车段苏联籍段长劳马诺夫和该局机务部苏籍电力课长司结巴诺夫，为表示中苏两大民族的伟大友谊，将他们所发明的铆钉加热用的电气烘炉，献给中国人民。现在东北铁路管理总局已决定通令公布，先由哈尔滨检车段试用后推广全路有关工厂和各段采用，并决定奖给劳马诺夫和司结巴诺夫两人每人奖金五十万元，奖章一枚。东北铁路管理总局局长余光生并亲自写信给他们表示谢意。
    电气烘炉由哈铁工厂制造以后，经试验结果，成绩很好，主要的特点是：带有轻便车轮，随时可以推动，在任何通电地方都能使用，节省煤炭，无须专人看守，铆工匠一人就可以进行工作。烧直径二分之一英寸至一英寸，长一英寸至三英寸以内的铆钉由十秒至一分钟就能烧好。用该炉烧的铆钉不含熔滓。电压只是一·五——二·五弗特，对工作者决无危险，仅在铆钉加热时才用电，很省电力。同时，又不发生烟气及煤炭灰尘，能保证工友健康，设有回节调整器，可以随时调整加热速度。
