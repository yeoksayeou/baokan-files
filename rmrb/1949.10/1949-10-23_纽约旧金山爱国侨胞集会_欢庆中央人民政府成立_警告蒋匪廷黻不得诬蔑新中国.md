　　Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 22nd: New York Air Mail: On the 9th and 10th of this month, patriotic overseas Chinese and students in New York, San Francisco, and other places held consecutive rallies to celebrate the founding of the People's Republic of China. As the participating overseas Chinese said, their gatherings were of historical significance.

　　The participants in the celebration meeting of the New York Chinese Laundry Association on the 9th included not only members and guests of the association in New York City, but also overseas Chinese from as far away as Washington and Philadelphia. So many people came that those who arrived late could not find a seat in the auditorium and had to stand in the reading room, office, corridor, and stairs.

　　Li Bingyue, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Association, and other speakers expressed their heartfelt support for the People's Government led by Chairman Mao, and encouraged each other to "work together to build a new China." Wu Yushu, an old member, excitedly sang at the meeting, earning rounds of applause and laughter. From 3 p.m. until the lights came on, the laundry industry's overseas Chinese were still talking and reluctant to leave.

　　More than 250 representatives from eighteen New York student cultural groups attended the celebration meeting on the 10th. After Chairman Zhu Qixian announced the opening of the meeting, all stood in silence to pay respect to the national flag of the People's Republic of China and the portraits of revolutionary leaders Sun Yat-sen and Mao Zedong. The new national anthem was then sung by all, and congratulatory speeches were delivered by various groups. The meeting also passed two temporary resolutions: First, to issue a "Declaration Celebrating the Founding of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China"; Second, to warn Jiang Tingfu not to continue to use the name of the Chinese representative to make absurd remarks in the United Nations and other places to slander the People's Republic of China.

　　Then, all the representatives raised their glasses to drink "New China's Birth Wine." For a time, under the golden star national flag, hundreds of hands held up red wine, and hundreds of happy faces were blessing the new China. People's enthusiasm grew higher and higher. After the chorus of "The East is Red," there was a shadow play "A Pack of Dogs" depicting the ugly features of Chiang's party's big and small traitors at home and abroad, performing those big and small dogs vividly. Finally, two students led more than two hundred representatives in a Yangge dance.

　　The enthusiastic celebration of the motherland's liberation by overseas Chinese is a thorn in the side of the dying remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek clique. Zhang Pingqun, the pseudo-Consul General stationed in New York, requested the U.S. government to intervene because overseas Chinese were hanging the Five-Star Red Flag, and threatened that hanging the new national flag would "arouse public outrage among patriots and cause serious disturbances of order."

　　Sure enough, at the celebration meeting of the Chinese Labor Cooperative in San Francisco on the 9th, more than forty American strongmen, armed with iron bars, axes, wooden sticks, and blue paint, broke into the meeting place, tore down the new national flag and slogans, and then smeared blue paint everywhere, shouting and hitting people wildly. A student, Wang Jun, and a Western guest were slightly injured. Minutes later, the police arrived, and the thugs had already left.

　　After this riot, more than five hundred overseas Chinese and guests at the venue were extremely indignant. After continuing the meeting, the choir first sang "Yellow River Cantata." The speakers then unanimously expressed that they would take action to resolutely support the newly born motherland's People's Government and strive to build an independent, democratic, prosperous, and strong new China.

　　It is reported that the Kuomintang reactionaries in San Francisco hired a total of forty-five Western thugs to disrupt the celebration meeting. The reward for each thug was ten U.S. dollars.

　　纽约旧金山爱国侨胞集会
  　欢庆中央人民政府成立
    警告蒋匪廷黻不得诬蔑新中国
    【新华社布拉格二十二日电】纽约航讯：本月九、十两日，在纽约、旧金山等地的爱国侨胞和学生，接连举行了庆祝中华人民共和国成立的大会。正如参加的侨胞们所说，他们的集会是富有历史意义的。
    参加九日纽约华侨洗衣馆联合会庆祝会的，不仅是纽约市的该会会员和来宾，连住在华盛顿、费列德菲亚等地的侨胞，也远道赶来了。人来得是这样多，以致迟到的已在礼堂里找不到一个座位，只得站在阅报室、办事处、走廊和楼梯上。
    大会主席该会常委李炳岳和其他讲话的人，都表示对毛主席所领导的人民政府的衷心拥护，并以“一致为建设新中国而努力”来相互勉励。老会员伍玉书，兴奋地一气在大会高歌，博得了一阵阵的鼓掌和欢笑。从下午三时起直到上灯的时候，欢聚一堂的洗衣业侨胞们，还在交谈，留恋不去。
    十八个纽约留学生文化团体十日的庆祝会，到有代表二百五十余人。主席朱启贤宣布开会后，全体肃立，对中华人民共和国国旗及革命领袖孙中山、毛泽东像致敬。全体旋唱新国歌，并由各团体致祝词。会议又通过两个临时决议：一，发表“庆祝中华人民共和国中央人民政府成立的宣言”；二，警告蒋廷黻不得续用中国代表名义在联合国及其他场所发表荒谬言论，诬蔑中华人民共和国。
    接着是全体代表举杯共饮“新中国诞生酒”。一时在金星国旗下，几百只手高举着红色的葡萄酒，几百个喜气迎迎的面孔，在为新中国祝福。人们的兴致越来越高，“东方红”的大合唱后，就是描写蒋党海内外大小卖国贼丑态的影子戏“群狗”，把那些大狗小狗们表演得淋漓尽致。最后，由两个同学领导全体代表二百余人，跳大秧歌舞。
    侨胞们的热情欢庆祖国解放，对于日暮途穷的蒋党余孽们来说，是个眼中钉。驻纽约伪总领事张平群，就借侨胞们悬挂五星国旗而要求美政府出来干涉，并扬言悬挂新国旗将“动爱国者之公愤而引起严重的秩序骚乱”。
    果然，在九日旧金山城华工合作会的庆祝会上，就有四十余名美国大汉，手持铁条、斧头、木械及蓝漆等，闯入会场，将新国旗、标语等扯下，继而四处涂抹蓝漆，狂呼打人。留学生王君及一西人来宾，均受轻伤。数分钟后，警察到来，暴徒们已扬长而去。
    经过这个骚乱，会场上的侨胞和来宾五百余人，莫不愤激异常。在继续开会后，首先就由歌咏团高唱“黄河大合唱”。接着讲话的人们，一致表示更要以行动来坚决拥护新生的祖国人民政府，为建设独立民主富强的新中国而奋斗。
    据悉，此次旧金山的国民党反动派共雇西人打手四十五名，以捣乱庆祝大会。每名打手的酬劳费为美金十元。
