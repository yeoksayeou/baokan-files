　　Moscow Oriental University Vice-President Fusinger and Timiryazev Agricultural Academy Dean Storatov Gave Lectures Upon Invitation Yesterday
        Fusinger Lectures at Revolutionary University on "Political Education of Soviet University Students"
    【Revolutionary University News】Professor Fusinger, Vice-President of Moscow Oriental University, was invited by North China People's Revolutionary University to give a speech at the West Square of Revolutionary University on the morning of the 10th, which was warmly welcomed by all 8,000 faculty and staff. After a brief welcoming speech by Vice-President Hu of the university, Professor Fusinger began his speech entitled "Political Education of Soviet University Students" amidst thunderous applause. He emphasized the importance and prominent position of Marxist-Leninist political education in Soviet university education. He said, "The study of Marxism-Leninism, the science of the laws of social development—the science of the development of proletarian revolution—is extremely necessary. A true Leninist is not only a specialist who loves science but also a politician who constantly cares about the fate of the motherland and actively participates in various construction tasks." He also explained that the Soviet Union has three most basic characteristics in training university students: First, scientific courses that are suitable for society and their own skills. Second, social and political activities. Third, the integration of technical science with Marxist-Leninist theory. All higher education students must study three courses: First, the fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism (mainly based on the Short History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union). Second, political economy. Third, dialectical materialism and historical materialism. In addition, they listen to reports once a month, such as the international situation, industrial and agricultural development, and the progress of the Five-Year Plan. Students ensure the completion of these learning tasks by participating in social and political work of both a school and extracurricular nature. Student organizations are divided according to profession, not by region. Every higher education institution has a Communist Party organization to lead various social and political tasks. Regular work involves participating in the organizations of the Party and the Communist Youth League and conducting professional propaganda; temporary work involves participating in the preparation work for the Soviet elections and propaganda and education work in factories, rural areas, and cities. These students, armed with Marxism-Leninism, play an active role in social politics, become true Leninists, and actively participate in the social politics of national construction. When students learn their specialized technologies, the courses must be taught using the Marxist-Leninist methods of dialectical materialism and historical materialism, giving them a Marxist-Leninist worldview so that they can recognize and improve the regularity of the subjects they study, and providing them with the educational weapon of criticism and self-criticism. University students participate in professional organizations, and every university has organizations similar to "teaching work joint conferences." At the same time, students must read domestic political newspapers and magazines. This ensures that every student is raised to the level required by the great leader Stalin. Professor Fusinger especially pointed out in his speech: This is fundamentally different from bourgeois education. Professor Fusinger's speech was short and pithy, richly introducing the spirit and teaching methods of Soviet education in concise language, and the whole audience responded with warm applause. Finally, children from the school's nursery presented flowers to Professor Fusinger on behalf of all the faculty and staff, and the deep friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people rippled across people's joyful and excited faces, sparking prolonged and enthusiastic cheers from the whole audience.

　　莫斯科东方大学副校长富辛格第米里亚夫农学院长斯托拉托夫 
    昨分别应邀讲演
        在革大讲“苏联大学生的政治教育”　富辛格
    【革大讯】苏联教育家莫斯科东方大学副校长富辛格教授应华北人民革命大学之请，于十日上午在革大西广场发表演说，受到全体八千学工人员热烈欢迎。该校胡副校长致简短的欢迎词之后，在雷动的掌声中，富辛格教授开始了题为“苏联大学生的政治教育”的讲演。他着重指出马列主义的政治教育在苏联大学教育中的重要性和所占的重要地位，他说：“马列主义关于社会发展规律的科学——无产阶级革命发展的科学的学习是极其必要的，真正的列宁主义者，不仅是喜爱科学的专门家，而且是政治家，经常关心祖国的命运，积极参加各种建设工作。”他并说明苏联训练大学生有三个最基本的特点：一、适合于社会与自己技能相符合的科学课程。二、社会政治活动。三、以马列主义的理论贯彻技术科学。所有高等学校学员都要学习三种课程：一、马列主义基础（以联共党史简明教程为主）。二、政治经济学。三、辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义。此外每月听报告一次，如国际形势、工业和农业发展情况，以及五年计划执行的程度等。学生们在保证这些学习任务的完成时是这样作的：很多人都参加校内外社会性质和政治性质的工作。学生的组织按照职业来分，而不按地域来分，每一高等学校都有共产党的组织，来领导各种社会政治性的工作。经常的工作是参加党与共产主义青年团的组织，并作职业宣传；临时的工作是参加苏维埃选举时的准备工作，工厂、农村、城市的宣传教育工作。这些以马列主义武装了的学生们在社会政治中起积极作用，成为真正的列宁主义者，积极的参加国家建设的社会政治家。学生们在学习自己专门技术时，课程的讲法必须是辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的马列主义的方法，使其有了马列主义的世界观，可以认识与提高所学科目的规律性。并加以批评与自我批评的教育武器。大学生参加职业组织，每一大学里都有类似“教学工作联席会”之类的组织。同时学员必须读国内的政治报张杂志。这样就保证了把每一学员都提高到伟大的领袖斯大林所要求的水平。富辛格教授在讲演中特别指出：这就是与资产阶级教育所基本不同的地方。富辛格教授的讲话短小而精悍，把苏联的教育精神和教学方法在简短的文词中丰富的介绍了出来，全场报以热烈的掌声。最后由校托儿所儿童，代表全体学工向富辛格教授献花，中苏两国人民深厚的友情荡漾在人们喜悦而兴奋的面容上，全场激起了长时间的热烈欢呼。
