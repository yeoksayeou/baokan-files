　　Work Summary of the CCP Beijing Municipal Committee Summer School Party Member Training Class

    I
    The total number of trainees in the Party Training Class was 731, with the ratio of Party members, Communist Youth League members, and progressive masses being 6:3:1. Among the Party members, probationary Party members accounted for 72%. The educational level of the trainees was: university students 46%, middle school students 31%, teaching assistants and researchers 13%, middle school teachers 6%, and the remainder were professors, doctors, nurses, and staff. The ratio of men to women was 7:3.

    Most of the trainees had participated in the student movement, possessed high revolutionary enthusiasm, and had some experience in mass work and were familiar with collective life. However, ideologically, they harbored strong petty-bourgeois liberalism, individual heroism, and narrow-minded nationalism. The Party members, being mostly underground Party members and new members, had not received systematic Party education and therefore lacked a clear class consciousness and basic knowledge of the Party. The League members and progressive masses had extremely high prestige for the Party, were eager to learn and hoped to join the Party, and could quickly accept our education.

    The trainees had high expectations for joining the Party Training Class, with most believing they could hear political reports from responsible leaders. Party members wanted to learn a set of skills for school branch work and mass work, while political teachers and the masses wanted to acquire knowledge of the Party's theory and policies.

    II
    Based on the above basic situation, the purpose of the Party Training Class was determined to be the transformation of Party members from intellectual backgrounds, by strengthening the education of the Marxist-Leninist revolutionary worldview and the education of the Party's organizational principles and current policies, in order to improve their political consciousness, strengthen their Party spirit, and improve school branch work.

    The educational policy to adapt to the above purpose was:
    1. Implement the principle of "less but精 (refined/essential)," concentrating efforts to solve some of the most basic positions, viewpoints, and thought methods within a limited time.
    2. Learning must be combined with ideological transformation, emphasizing the need to first review one's own thinking in connection with learning.
    3. Learning should be combined with practical work, and at the same time, the branch work and mass work of the school should be reviewed in connection with learning.

    The learning content was divided into three parts: 1. Historical Materialism; 2. Party Program and Constitution; 3. Part of the Party's current policies. At that time, Chairman Mao's "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" was published and was also included as a learning content.

    III
    After the start of learning, due to the high educational level of the trainees and the influence of bourgeois education, some requested to read more theoretical books. They were not humble and careful enough when reading, did not pay attention to others' speeches during discussions, were accustomed to reasoning and comparing concepts, splitting hairs, or raising issues that either belonged to the past or were very distant in the future; middle school students lingered in explaining nouns. In response to this phenomenon, we strived to emphasize that the purpose of learning was to transform one's own thinking and viewpoints, and to first compare one's past thoughts and viewpoints with the correct viewpoints of Marxism-Leninism in order to recognize the errors and class roots of the old viewpoints. At the same time, we called on everyone to fully expose their thoughts and engage in free discussion, because only in this way can the purpose of ideological transformation be achieved. We also demanded the cultivation of a humble and practical learning attitude, opposing aiming too high and being arrogant. In this way, everyone began to feel that the learning in the Party Training Class was significantly different from the past methods of reading, because this kind of learning and discussion touched their own thoughts and viewpoints every time.

    In order to understand everyone's level, we held a test, which cultivated a humble learning attitude and improved everyone's learning enthusiasm.

    IV
    In the progress of learning, we first spent a week studying historical materialism, mainly studying three issues:
    1. Labor creates the world.
    2. The scientific historical view – Communism will inevitably be realized.
    3. Class struggle and the proletariat leading the revolution.

    This method of first studying historical materialism is very necessary because it is the most basic position and viewpoint and is of great help for the subsequent study of the Party Program and Constitution.

    Secondly, we studied "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," which is the Party's current general policy. In the study, we clarified the state and the regime, clarified our understanding of internationalism, and the reason for leaning to the Soviet Union.

    After that, we studied the Party Program and Constitution, and listened to a report on the history of the Party. In the study, we focused on the nature of the Party, the mass line, Party members, the ideological and organizational cultivation of Party members, Party spirit and individuality, the relationship between Party members and the Party, leadership and being led, and combined this with thought reviews of the motivation for joining the Party and one's own history. Here, we did not study the entire Party Program and Constitution, but only studied several important issues, and finally, in connection with the actual situation of various schools, we studied branch work.

    In the study of current policies, we listened to reports on Party newspapers, security work, higher education policies, school youth work, and the establishment of the League. At the same time, we also listened to a complaint meeting of workers from a cadre training class, which gave everyone a practical lesson in class education.

    In the progress of learning, we basically grasped the principle of "less but精 (refined/essential)." Although we had initially listed too many learning materials and discussion outlines, this was quickly corrected, and we recognized that we should clearly put forward several main issues, and then concentrate our efforts to solve them, both in connection with reality and raising them to the level of theory, rather than systematically conducting theoretical learning or attempting to solve too many problems.

    V
    The organization of the Party Training Class was that the Municipal Party Committee designated six comrades to form the Party Committee, with two sections within it. The Education Section was responsible for guiding learning, preparing discussion outlines, reference books, compiling learning newspapers, understanding the learning situation of each branch, and guiding the reading of Party newspapers. The Organization Section was responsible for the organization of branches and other work. However, the Education Section and the Organization Section were both internal divisions of the Party Committee. The leadership of the branches was directly responsible by the Party Committee. The Party Committee had branches under it, and we formed branches according to the following situations:

    1. Form branches according to the original organization of each school. Students from one school are still in one branch. This is so that they can connect with the actual situation of each school during learning, and they are familiar with each other, making it easier to conduct self-criticism.
    2. One hundred people form a branch, and twenty people form a group. If the number of people is insufficient, it is adjusted according to the strength of the branch work in each school and combined into one branch.
    3. Appropriately send outstanding Party members from the university branches to the middle school branches to help with learning and strengthen the leadership of the middle school branches.
    4. University professors, lecturers, and assistants are grouped into one branch. The original intention was to take care of their lives. Now it seems that it would be better to merge them with the students.

    The appropriate number of people in a branch is an important issue. We carefully considered and discussed it and asked everyone to study it. As a result, the vast majority believed that a branch of one hundred people was the appropriate number for holding large discussion meetings, and a group of twenty people could take care of the lack of cadres (otherwise the candidates for group leader would be weaker), and holding group meetings with twenty people made it easier for the speeches to be enthusiastic and for the discussion to be more in-depth.

    We had no experience in running short-term training classes, so we adopted a leadership method of constantly listening to the opinions of the masses and developing collective creativity: First, the higher-level leadership meetings frequently convened lower-level cadres to participate (such as the Party Committee convening branch secretaries to participate). This not only allowed the leadership to closely connect with the specific situation, but also allowed the decisions to be quickly issued and implemented, which is more in line with the principle of training cadres. Secondly, the leadership frequently studied the learning situation (at least three meetings per week), promptly discovered problems, and could quickly make decisions and immediately implement them. We must be vigilant about the time limit of the short-term training class and not allow delays. In addition, the Party Committee should also appropriately convene enlarged cadre meetings or general meetings of all trainees to strengthen the planning and ideological leadership of learning. In our experience, this leadership method has won the support of the masses and is suitable for the characteristics of the short-term training class.

    VI
    In terms of learning methods, most comrades initially only hoped to listen to large reports. We proposed a learning method of first carefully reading the documents, carefully studying and discovering problems, and then listening to the answer reports. After repeated persuasion and explanation, around the end of the second week, everyone fully accepted this opinion, which was reflected in the fact that each branch could focus on reading the documents, rather than coming to the Party Committee every day to ask if there were any reports.

    In the leadership of collective learning, we believe that it is more appropriate to conduct learning in the following procedure: First, point out the documents that must be carefully read, the number of pages, and the time, and call on everyone to read on their own first, because learning must use one's own thinking ability, and there is no foundation without self-study.

    In self-study, we also advocate mutual assistance, that is, to raise questions to each other, or to answer small difficulties. This is the role that the mutual assistance groups of about five people should play (some people treat the mutual assistance groups as a level of organization, and any questions are first discussed by the mutual assistance group, and then submitted upwards, this method is not correct).

    Before and after self-study and discussion meetings, appropriate casual talks should be organized. Its purpose is to discover problems, cultivate thinking ability, or explain nouns. Casual talks should be appropriate for half an hour to an hour (it is not right to have them for more than three hours).

    After self-study, casual talks, and raising questions, hold group discussion meetings to solve easy problems first. Important issues should be discussed and then submitted to the branch meeting.

    The branch meeting must focus on the common and important issues in the discussions of each group, sort them out, and put them forward for discussion. The leadership of the branch meeting should have a presidium (three to five people). During the discussion, try to connect with the actual thinking, and at the same time, advocate bold suspicion and democratic discussion. Not only are we not afraid of debates, but we should induce debates, because debates are the easiest way to expose thinking and make problems unfold and be able to go deeper.

    Finally, the issues in the debate are collected and handed over to the leading comrades to give answer reports (a total of fourteen large answer reports have been listened to).

    This is our learning method. In the one-month study, everyone was relatively satisfied with this method.

    When using this learning method, it is necessary to strengthen the planning and organization of the leadership (the requirements in this regard are extremely strict for short-term training classes), otherwise, the pace will be disordered and the learning effect will be affected. For example, when studying "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," it was temporarily decided to extend it for three days, and as a result, the general reaction was that the learning in these three days was relatively scattered.

    In terms of theoretical guidance, we benefited greatly from the participation of two comrades from the Marxist-Leninist Academy who helped with learning and gave three small reports.

    VII
    At the same time, we also arranged four internship educations on Party affairs work, which achieved very good results. The content was:

    The first week, elect the branch committee.

    The second week, discuss the conversion of probationary Party members to full members.

    The third week, approve the admission of new Party members.

    The fourth week, the Party Committee convened a general meeting of all Party members to hold an admission ceremony for new Party members.

    These four branch meetings were carefully prepared because they were demonstration in nature. Many comrades only learned some Party affairs work through these meetings. It is also of great significance to the ideological education of Party members. Some Party members believe that after these meetings, he truly joined the Party, felt that he had been too careless in joining the Party underground in the past, requested to rewrite his autobiography, and hoped that the Party would review it. Some comrades saw that others were so cautious when transferring to full membership, so they also reviewed their history and reported to the Party.

    VIII
    In terms of life, we first paid special attention to the arrangement of the schedule. Initially, some comrades felt mentally insufficient in the morning because they were not used to getting up early. We immediately launched a discussion and, after careful research, revised the schedule.

    Secondly, we organized half-day labor on Saturdays, and at the end, we launched a general cleaning. These labors had practical educational significance for everyone.

    The general reaction of comrades is that the life in the Party Training Class is relatively tense. We believe that it is normal for the life in a one-month short-term training class to be tense, but we must pay attention to regularizing life (morning exercises, meals, and sleep) to prevent illness.

    It should be specially pointed out that the general affairs work of the Party Training Class is satisfactory. In a very short period of time, we carefully arranged many temporary learning equipment for everyone (such as installing electric lights in the yard), and the management of meals was also very good. Moreover, there was a surplus of more than 2.75 million yuan, which also greatly helped to complete the education plan.

### 中共北京市委会暑期学校党员训练班工作总结

　　中共北京市委会暑期学校党员训练班工作总结
    一
    党训班学员总数七三一人，其中党员、青年团员、进步群众为六、三、一之比；党员中候补党员占百分之七十二；学员之文化水平大学生为百分之四十六，中学生为百分之三十一，讲助研为百分之十三，中学教员为百分之六，其余为教授、医生、护士、职员；男女为七与三之比。
    学员大部分参加过学生运动，革命热情很高，在群众工作上多少有些经验，也熟悉集体生活，但在思想上存在着浓厚的小资产阶级自由主义，个人英雄思想，狭隘民族观念；其中党员因为都是地下党员，且大多是新党员，未受过系统的党的教育，所以缺乏清晰的阶级观念和党的基本知识；团员和进步群众，对党有极高威信，热望学习，希望入党，能很快的接受我们的教育。
    学员入党训班希望很高，多数认为可听到负责首长的政治报告，党员则想学会一套学校支部工作和群众工作的本领，政治教员和群众则要求获得党的理论和政策方面的知识。
    二
    根据以上基本情况，确定党训班的目的，是改造知识分子出身的党员，从加强马列主义的革命人生观的教育及党的组织原则和当前政策的教育，以提高其政治觉悟，加强其党性，并改进学校支部工作。
    适应上述目的的教育方针是：
    １、贯彻少而精的原则，以有限的时间，集中力量解决一些最基本的立场、观点和思想方法。
    ２、必须使学习与思想改造相结合，强调在学习中首先联系自己的思想进行检讨。
    ３、要求学习与实际工作相结合，在学习中同时检讨学校的支部工作与群众工作。
    在学习内容上规定为三部分：１、唯物史观；２、党纲党章；３、部分党的当前政策。当时又适逢毛主席发表“论人民民主专政”，亦作为学习内容之一。
    三
    学习开始后，由于学员的文化水平较高，并受资产阶级教育影响，于是有的要求多读理论书籍。在阅读时不够虚心、仔细，讨论时不注意听别人发言，习惯与概念的推理与比较，钻牛角尖，或提出一些不是属于过去，便是很远的未来的问题；中学同学则停留于解释名词。我们针对这种现象，便竭力强调学习的目的是改造自己的思想、观点，先把自己过去的思想观点与马烈主义的正确观点作比较，以便认识旧观点的错误及阶级根源；同时号召大家充分暴露自己思想，展开自由讨论，因为只有这样，才能达到改造思想的目的；并要求培养虚心、切实的学习态度，反对好高鹜远，自高自大。这样，大家开始觉得党训班的学习与过去的读书方法有显著的不同，因为这种学习与讨论每一次都触动了自己的思想观点。
    为了了解大家的程度，我们举行了一次测验，结果既培养了虚心的学习态度，又提高了大家的学习热情。
    四
    在学习的进行上，我们首先以一周的时间，学习唯物史观，主要学习三个问题：
    １、劳动创造世界。
    ２、科学的历史观点——共产主义必然实现。
    ３、阶级斗争，和无产阶级领导革命。
    这种先学习唯物史观的方法是非常必要的，因为这是最基本的立场和观点，对以后党纲和党章的学习有极大的帮助。
    其次，学习了“论人民民主专政”，这是党的当前总政策，在学习中弄清楚了国家和政权，明确了对国际主义的认识，以及何以要倒向苏联一边的道理。
    以后便是党纲与党章的学习，并听了党史的报告；学习中，着重党的性质，群众路线，党员，党员思想上与组织上的修养，党性与个性，党员与党的关系，领导与被领导，并联系入党动机和自己的历史作思想检讨。这里，我们没有学习全部的党纲和党章，而只是学习了其中几个重要问题，最后又联系到各校的实际情况，学习了支部工作。
    在当前政策学习上，我们听了关于党报、保卫工作、高教政策、学校青年工作和建团等报告，同时还听了一次干训班工人的诉苦大会，使大家上了一课实际的阶级教育。
    在学习的进行上，基本上是掌握了少而精的原则，虽然开始时曾过多的列出学习材料和讨论提纲，但是迅即得到了纠正，并认识到应明确的提出几个主要问题，然后便集中力量，既联系实际，又提高到理论上加以解决，而不是要系统的进行理论学习，或企图解决过多的问题。
    五
    党训班的组织是由市委指定六个同志组成党委会，内设两个科。教育科负责指导学习，拟发讨论提纲，参考书，编学习报，了解各支部的学习情况，指导读党报。组织科则负责支部的编制等工作。但教育科与组织科都是党委会内部的分工。对支部的领导，则统一由党委会直接负责。党委会下设有支部，我们按以下情况编成支部：
    １、按各校的原来组织编支部。一校同学仍在一个支部，这是为了学习时可以联系各校的实际情况，而且彼此熟悉，易于进行自我批评。
    ２、一百人编一支部，二十人编一小组，如人数不足时按各校支部工作的强弱，加以调节，合成一支部。
    ３、适当的派各大学支部的优秀党员到各中学支部去，帮助学习以加强中学支部的领导。
    ４、大学教授、讲助等合编一个支部，原意是为了照顾他们的生活，现在看来，如果与同学合并在一起，收效会更好些。
    支部人数以多少为适宜，是一个重要的问题，我们曾经仔细的考虑和讨论，并提出大家研究，结果绝大多数认为百人的支部是开大讨论会较适宜的人数，二十人的小组可照顾干部的缺乏（否则小组长人选要弱），而且二十人开小组会，发言容易热烈，并能使讨论比较深入。
    我们都没有办短训班的经验，所以便采取随时听取群众意见，发扬集体创造性的领导方法：首先是上级领导会议经常召集下一级干部参加（如党委会召集支书参加），这样既可使领导上密切联系具体情况，同时决议又能迅速下达执行，更符合了培养干部的原则；其次是领导上经常研究学习情况（每周至少三次会议），及时发现问题，并能迅速作出决定，立即贯彻执行，要警惕短训班的时间性，不容拖延；此外，党委会还应适当召集扩大的干部会议或全体学员大会作报告，以加强学习上的计划性和思想领导，这种领导方法，在我们的经验中，是获得群众拥护，并适合短训班的特点。
    六
    在学习方式上，开始多数同志都只是希望听大报告，我们则提出先精读文件，仔细研究发现问题，然后再听解答报告的学习方式，经过多次的说服解释，约于第二周末，大家才完全接受这个意见，表现在各支部能安心的读文件，而不是每天到党委会来问有无报告。
    在集体学习的领导上，我们认为按照以下的程序进行学习是比较适当的，即是：首先指出必须精读的文件，页数和时间，号召大家先自己阅读，因为学习必须运用自己的思考能力，没有自学就没有基础。
    在自学中又提倡互助，即相互提出问题质疑，或解答小的疑难，这就是五人左右所组成的互助小组应发挥的作用（有些把互助小组当作一级组织，有问题先经互助小组讨论，再往上提出，这种方法是不对的）。
    在自学时和讨论会前后，都要适当的组织漫谈会，它的目的是为发掘问题，互相培养思考能力，或解释名词，漫谈会以半小时到一小时为适宜（有的开三小时以上也是不对的）。
    经过自学、漫谈、提出问题后，再召开小组讨论会，先解决容易的问题。对重要的问题则经过讨论，再提交支部大会。
    支部大会必须集中各小组讨论中具有普遍性的重要问题，加以整理，提出讨论。支部大会的领导应有主席团（三人至五人），讨论时要尽量联系思想实际，同时提倡大胆怀疑，民主讨论，不仅不怕争论，而且应诱导争论的发生，因为争论是最容易暴露思想，而使问题展开并能深入的方法。
    最后把争论中的问题汇集起来，交领导同志作解答报告（共听过十四次大解答报告）。
    这就是我们的学习方式，一个月的学习中，大家是比较满意于这种方式的。
    在运用这种学习方式时，要加强领导上的计划性与组织性（短期训练班在这一点上的要求是极严格的），否则会发生步调紊乱而影响学习效果。例如在学习“论人民民主专政”时，临时决定延长三天，结果普遍反应这三天的学习比较散漫。
    在理论指导上，因有马列学院二位同志参加帮助学习，并作了三次小报告，获益甚大。
    七
    同时我们还布置了四次关于党务工作的实习教育，它获得很好的效果，其内容是：
    第一周、选举支部委员会。
    第二周、讨论候补党员的转正。
    第三周、通过新党员的入党。
    第四周、党委会召集全体党员大会举行新党员入党仪式。
    这四次支部大会，因为是示范性质，都经过慎重准备。许多同志经过这些大会才初步的学会了一些党务工作。它对党员的思想教育也有很大的意义，有的党员认为经过这些大会，他才真正入了党，觉得自己过去在地下入党太马虎，要求重写自传，并希望党审查，有的同志看到别人转正时那样慎重，于是也检讨了自己的历史，并向党报告。
    八
    在生活上，我们首先特别重视作息时间的安排，最初由于起床时间较早，有些同志因不习惯而有在上午精神不足的感觉，我们当即迅速的发动大家讨论，并经过慎重的研究后，修改了作息时间表。
    其次是组织星期六的半日劳动，临结束时更发动了大扫除，这些劳动对大家具有实际的教育意义。
    一般同志的反应，觉得党训班的生活较紧张，我们认为一个月的短期训练班，生活紧张乃是正常的情形，但必须注意生活规律化（早操、伙食、和睡眠），用以防止引起疾病。
    应该特别提出，党训班的总务工作是令人满意的，在极短期间内，为大家用心布置了许多学习上的临时设备（如院中按置电灯），伙食的管理也是很好的。而且还有二七五万余元的节余，对教育计划的完成也有很大帮助。
