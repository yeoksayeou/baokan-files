　　The Yi People Under the Kuomintang's Bloody Rule

　　Landlords, Bureaucrats, and Comprador Groups Create Hatred

　　“Yi Affairs” was a “masterpiece” of the landlord, bureaucrat, and comprador groups' reactionary government in controlling the Yi people under Great Han chauvinism. When we mention the Yi people (the ruling class has always called them "Lolos"), we associate them with the Siamese reactionary group Luang Phibuns' "Greater Thai Doctrine." The so-called "Greater Thai Doctrine" is a theory of national superiority that aims to invade the southwestern provinces of China. The Siamese reactionary group used fabricated anthropological views to classify the Yi people as Thai; in order to achieve the goal of invading the southwestern provinces of China, the Japanese reactionary group launched the Siamese reactionary group to attack Yunnan during World War II. This is something that the Chinese people can never sit idly by and watch.

　　In the border areas of the southwestern provinces of China, there are a considerable number of ethnic minorities, such as the Miao and Yao. Among them, the Yi people are also a large ethnic group, and they live in the large and small Liangshan areas and the mountainous wilderness on both sides of the Jinsha River, bordering the four provinces of Sichuan, Kangding (former Xikang), Yunnan, and Guizhou. There are no accurate statistics on the number of this ethnic group. Some estimate it to be tens of thousands, while others estimate it to be one million six or seven hundred thousand. The Yi's socio-economic system is still in the stage of slave society. The two classes within it are the Black Yi and the Wazi (White Yi). The former are slave owners, and the latter are slaves. Needless to say, their cultural level is low. There are not even wooden stools in their houses. Their agricultural products are mainly miscellaneous grains such as buckwheat. The lives of the Yi people can be imagined. The Chinese reactionary ruling group, like they do with other working people, adopts various methods of exploitation and oppression against the Yi people in order to achieve their goal of "getting promoted and making a fortune."

　　In the early years, opium was imported from India. Although Lin Zexu tried to stop it, poppy plants eventually spread throughout the country. Since the Republic of China, the Kuomintang reactionary government's hypocritical "opium prohibition" was just transplanting opium seedlings to the "barbaric" border areas to facilitate profiting from it. Nowadays, opium has become a special product in the large and small Liangshan areas. Every year during the opium harvest season in spring and autumn, key members of the reactionaries send capable people carrying silver, silver dollars, guns, and ammunition in teams from all over. The reactionary army also does not let go of the opportunity to seek profit, and the bureaucrats are also happy to be in time. The military, government, police, and law all mobilized together, taking advantage of the names of "opium prohibition," "opium inspection," "opium eradication," and "opium suppression" to make a fortune. The direct line of the war criminal Chen Cheng, Fang Jing of the bogus 79th Army, and Xiang Minsi of the bogus 89th Division, began to collude with Liu Ren'an, the bogus Leshan commissioner, in 1946, using the name of opium eradication to collect opium and property in the Lei, Ma, Ping, and E areas, leaving the Yi people bankrupt and unable to make a living, while the Kuomintang reactionary group, from top to bottom, were all stuffed with food and fat. Those Yi people who could get guns would also use these weapons to rob or take private revenge. There was no order in society, and the people could not live in peace.

　　Opium was the main object of plunder by the reactionary group. Secondly, the mountains and fields of the Lei, Ma, Ping, and E areas produced precious mountain delicacies, and the gold of the Jinsha River was coveted by the reactionary group. They cheaply bought labor and instructed bandits and secret agents to organize "reclamation societies" in order to achieve their goals of harming people and seeking profit. Recently, they have even expanded their monopolistic clutches everywhere, devouring the "Yi" people's means of livelihood. For example, Zhangla Township and Jinhe Township, which belong to Songpan County, are famous gold-producing areas in Sichuan. In 1940, there were more than 1,000 gold factories, but now only ten remain, which are related to the warlords and the reactionary government, such as Wei Bingran and Li Rongwu. In addition, there are countless cases of collecting precious medicinal materials, controlling valuable mineral deposits, and forcibly occupying land.

　　The internal contradictions of the bureaucrat, landlord, and comprador reactionary group were fully manifested in the "Yi affairs" work in the border areas. He Guoguang, a direct line of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang, was stationed in Xichang in the name of bogus Southwest Military and Political Deputy Commander to suppress the Yi people. Liu Wenhui was stationed in Ya'an in the name of bogus Xikang Provincial Chairman to suppress the Yi people. Wang Lingji, the bogus Sichuan Chairman, was stationed in Chengdu to suppress the Yi people. Each of them expanded their own power and mutually deployed armed forces to oppress the people. For example, Liu Wenhui appointed Yang Ren'an as the Border Area Joint Defense Commander, under whose jurisdiction were Hanyuan, Yuejun, Jining, and Tuowu; at the same time, Wang Lingji ordered Liu Shucheng, the former commander of the 17th Sichuan Army, to be the garrison commander of the Lei, Ma, Ping, E, and Mu border areas. In short, you stab with a gun, and I slash with a knife, and no one showed weakness, but it was the "Yi" people who were stabbed and shot.

　　The Yi people were squeezed in this way by feudal forces, autocratic bureaucrats, and comprador groups who were running dogs of imperialism. Spontaneous Yi resistance movements also unfolded in the form of anti-Han sentiment. Every time these Yi people appeared with carbines, submachine guns, revolvers, and other sophisticated long and short guns, the reactionary government's army would naturally flee in disarray. The pity was that the neighboring good farmers, both men and women, were captured by the Yi people as spoils of victory and incorporated into the ranks of the Wazi (slaves). Ethnic hatred was gradually formed under the fabrication of the reactionary class.

　　　　Recent Examples of Grievances in Liangshan

　　The grievances in the large and small Liangshan areas are historical events between the Han and Yi peoples. This kind of event continues as long as the reactionary ruling class exists. In order to understand the development of this ethnic event, I will describe a recent and relatively large-scale war between the Yi and Han peoples.

　　This war was triggered by the dispute over the "Ning District Border Pacification Commander"; it began to deteriorate in February of this year; now the scope of the war is large and fierce. In addition to the two regiments of "Yi" soldiers and "Han" soldiers owned by Deng Deliang (Han) and Sun Fang (Yi, styled Ziwu), who were fighting for the "Commander" position, there was also the bogus "Central Army" 136th Division. The war lasted intermittently for half a year and has not been resolved to this day.

　　"Ning District" refers to the eight counties and one administrative bureau that were划去 from Sichuan when Xikang Province was established. The counties are Xiwu, Huili, Yuejun, Mianning, Yanyuan, Yanbian, Ningnan, and Zhaojue, as well as the Ningdong Administrative Bureau. In addition, there are sixteen political districts, bordering Wumeng in the east, Yanjing in the west, the Jinsha River in the south, and the Dadu River in the north, stretching for thousands of miles. Among them are towering mountains, deep ravines and rushing water, dense forests, fertile soil, and abundant mineral resources. This is the Liangshan area, where the Yi people live. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, Deng Xiuting (Deng Deliang's father), a Han Chinese, kidnapped Han people for the Yi people, gathered Han people to penetrate into the "Yi" area, and used force to pacify the Yi people, obtaining the official title of "Border Pacification Commander" and ruling despotically for decades. After Deng's death in August 1944, He Guoguang, the bogus Southwest Deputy Commander, opposed Deng Deliang's immediate succession, and telegraphed Liu Wenhui: "The young prince is young, and the empress dowager is昏庸, cannot interfere in politics. Uncle is loyal and righteous, and can be entrusted with guardianship to exercise regency." "Uncle" refers to the Yi leader Sun Fang. Sun had made a pact with Deng Xiuting and made "meritorious contributions" at the same time as Deng, and was appointed "Deputy Border Pacification Commander." He is now over sixty years old. Sun is highly educated and has an open mind. The reactionary regime also wooed him and led the "Yi Tourist Delegation" to visit Chongqing, Chengdu, Nanjing, and Shanghai the year before last to prepare for running schools and improving the Yi people's cultural level. Deng Deliang, under the instigation of his mother, Lü Xian, constantly squeezed the Yi people. Three years ago, he killed an Yi leader in Tuowu for no reason, and the Yi people had long held a grudge against him. However, Chiang Kai-shek loved "talent" and wanted him to go to the Nanjing Infantry School for training. After graduation, Chiang Kai-shek appointed him to restore his father's position as "Ning District Border Pacification Commander" and appointed Deng's uncle as the commander of the "Yi Soldiers Regiment." When the Yi people in Ning District learned of this order, they felt that the demon king was returning to office and were greatly dissatisfied, and Liu Wenhui also expressed his dissent. In order to appease the people's anger, He Guoguang asked to change the appointment to Sun Fang as "Acting Border Pacification Commander of Ning District," and Deng Deliang was transferred to "Yi Soldiers Regiment Commander." The ambitious Deng Deliang and others refused to accept and summoned their old subordinates. Sun Fang also did not wait and sent troops to meet them. In February, Deng Deliang used the name of "Border Pacification Commander" in his father's old nest, Lugu, to "suppress" Sun Fang, and the two sides fought. Later, Deng Deliang looted the families of Sun Fang's subordinates, and Sun Fang also eliminated one battalion of Deng Deliang's troops. At this time, the Yi people in various places launched attacks on the Han people. He Guoguang was afraid that the "Yi people" would descend from the mountains, so he decided to transfer the bogus 136th Division. This ethnic dispute was also used by the reactionary ruling group as a tool for internal struggle. Wang Lingji and Yang Sen, who were direct descendants of the bogus "Central Government," issued a telegram in the name of the Xikang Chongqing Fellow Association, requesting the bogus Southwest Commander's Office to dismiss Liu Wenhui and investigate him. It is very obvious that the reactionary group is using ethnic disputes to create opportunities to seize power and gain profit.

　　　　Marxism-Leninism Can Reasonably Solve National Problems

　　The above-mentioned Yi issue illustrates how the Kuomintang reactionary group is creating ethnic hatred and using the theory of Great Han national superiority to increase the interests of the reactionary group. This also illustrates the reactionary nature of the old democracy (bourgeois democracy). For example, the old Three People's Principles advocated "opposing the Manchus and revitalizing the Han," that is, opposing the then rulers, the Manchus, while advocating Great Han chauvinism (such as the views of "bloodline" and "national race" and Greater Asianism). Opposing the Manchus certainly had its progressive significance in that era, but Great Han chauvinism pushed humanity back into the abyss of ethnic strife. Generally speaking, this is beneficial to the reactionary ruling class who seek profit and find exploitation, but it is of no benefit to the entire human race and the vast majority of the working class and peasants. As Stalin said: "The system of private property and capital inevitably disunites nations, strengthens discord between nations, and intensifies national oppression, while the system of collective ownership and labor inevitably unites nations, eliminates discord between nations, and destroys national oppression." (Stalin: "The National Question and Leninism")

　　In China, the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang is working hard to create discord internationally. In the national issue domestically, its actions are as described above, clamoring for Great Han chauvinism. The so-called "Five Races Coexisting in Harmony" has been subordinated to the racial superiority theory of "Great Han Chauvinism." Since the "Republic of China," the various ethnic groups in the country have not had a single day of peace. They are either attacking Mongolia, or preparing for the Uyghurs, or excluding the Manchus, or oppressing the Miao. Looking at the liberated areas, they are precisely based on Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, proceeding from the fundamental interests of the people of all ethnic groups in the world (that is, the common interests of all mankind), and proceeding from the common fundamental interests of the people of the whole country domestically. Now, the Chinese Communist Party is precisely uniting the various ethnic groups in the country in this way to eliminate and resolutely oppose any form of national oppression.

　　In the near future, the painful fate of the Yi people will disappear along with the liberation of the whole country. The sun has shone on the Liangshan Mountains.

　　国民党血腥统治下的
　  彝族人民
    地主、官僚、买办集团制造仇恨
    “夷务”是地主、官僚、买办集团反动政府，在大汉族主义下的统制彝族人的“杰作”。提到彝族（统治阶级历来称之曰“猓猓”）这个民族，我们会联想到暹罗反动集团銮披汶的“大泰主义”。所谓“大泰主义”是以中国西南各省为侵略目标的民族优越“理论”。暹罗反动集团以伪造的人种学观点把彝族人列入泰族；日本反动集团为达到侵略中国西南各省的目的，在二次世界大战中曾发动暹罗反动集团进攻云南。这是中国人民所决不能坐视的。
    中国西南各省边区地带，散居着为数不少的少数民族，如苗、摇等。其中彝族人也是一个大族，他们集居在川、康、云、贵四省相临的边界地区的大小凉山区及金沙江两岸的山野莽原。对于这个民族的数目，尚无精确统计，有人估计为十几万人，也有估到一百六七十万的。彝族的社会经济仍停留在奴隶社会的阶段，它内部的两个阶级是黑夷和娃子（白夷），前者是奴隶主，后者是奴隶，文化程度不消说是低的，房子里连木橙都没有，农产品为油麦等杂粮，彝族人的生活可想而知。中国反动统治集团对彝族人民也象对其他劳动人民一样，采用各种各样的剥削压迫方式，借以达到他们“升官发财”的目的。
    早年鸦片由印度输入，虽经林则徐之阻击，但罂花终在全国各地蔓布起来。民国以来，国民党反动政府假惺惺的“禁烟”，不过是把烟苗移植在边“野蛮”区以便利从中渔利而已。如今，鸦片在大小凉山已成为一种特产品，每年春秋收烟季节，反动派的要员们各派干练携带白银、白洋、枪支弹药等，成队结伙纷纷由各地前来。反动军队也自不干放松谋利机会，官僚也庆幸得时，真是军政警法宪一齐出动，假借“禁烟”、“查烟”、“铲烟”、“缉烟”的名义大发其财。战犯陈诚的嫡系伪七十九军方靖，伪八十九师向敏思，在三十五年就开始会同伪乐山专员刘仁庵假借铲烟为名，到雷、马、屏、峨地区收鸦片财物，把彝族人弄得倾家荡产，无生活余地，而国民党反动集团上上下下却都肠满脑肥。那些能得到枪支的彝族也就恃此武器打劫或报私仇，社会自谈不上秩序，人民更不能安居。
    鸦片是反动集团劫掠的主要对象，其次雷、马、屏、峨区一带山野出产山珍奇货，金沙江的金更是反动集团所垂涎的。他们廉价收买劳力指使匪特组织什么“垦社”，而达到他们害入谋利的目的。近来他们更在各地展开他们的独占魔掌，把“夷”民的生财吞蚀，如松潘县属漳腊乡金河乡是四川著名的产金地，民国二十九年有金厂一千余家，目前只剩下与军阀反动政府有关系的魏炳然、李荣武等十家。此外，珍贵药材的收割，宝贵矿藏的把持，强占霸道之事，更是数不胜数。
    官僚、地主、买办反动集团的内部矛盾，无例外的在边区“夷务”工作上也充分表现出来。蒋介石匪帮嫡系贺国光以伪西南军政副长官的名义驻西昌镇压彝族人民，刘文辉以伪西康省主席的名义驻雅安镇压彝族人，伪四川主席王陵基驻在成都镇压彝族人，各人为着扩大自己的权力，而互张压迫人民的武力。如刘文辉委羊仁安为边区联防司令辖属汉源、越隽、冀宁、拖乌；同时，王陵基又命前川军十七师长刘树成为雷、马、屏、峨、沐边区守备司令。总之你一枪我一刀，谁也不示弱，但挨刀挨枪的却是“夷”民。
    彝族人民便是这样在封建势力、专制官僚、帝国主义走狗的买办集团手中被压挤着，自发的彝族反抗运动也在反汉族的形式下展开，每次这些彝族人拿着卡宾枪、冲锋枪、左轮等精利长短枪出现时，反动政府的军队自不待言的逃散，可怜的是临近的良善农民男女、便被彝族人掳去作为胜利品，编入娃子（奴隶）的队伍。民族仇恨就在反动阶级的编造下逐步结成起来。
    　　　　凉山恩仇近例
    大小凉山恩仇，是汉彝两民族的历史事件。这种事件是随着反动统治阶级的存在而不休。为了了解这个民族事件的发展，我记述最近一次相当大的关于彝、汉两族战争的实事。
    这个战争是以“宁属靖边司令”之争导火；至今年二月开始恶化；现在战争范围大而剧烈。参加战争的除有争“司令”的邓德亮（汉人）和孙仿（彝族人字子汶）各拥有的两团“夷”兵“汉”军外，还有伪“中央军”一三六师，战争断续相持达半年之久，至今未能解决。
    “宁属”是指西康设省时由四川划去的八县一设治局而言，属县有西武、会理、越隽、冕宁、盐源、盐边、宁南、昭觉等八县及宁东设治局，此外还有十六个政治区，东连乌蒙、西接盐井，南到金沙江，北至大渡河，长达千余里。其间崇山峻岭，涧深水激，山林茂密，土壤肥沃，矿产丰富，这就是大凉山区域，彝族人就住在这里。清末，汉人邓秀廷（邓德亮之父）为彝族出掳汉人，纠合汉人深入“夷”区，以武力打平了彝族，得了个“靖边司令”官衔，并且专制地统治了几十年之久。三十三年八月邓死后，伪西南副长官贺国光反对邓子德亮马上继任，曾致电刘文辉：“皇儿年幼，吕后昏庸，不可干政，亚父忠义，可托孤以摄政”，“亚父”者系指彝族领袖孙仿而言。孙曾和邓秀廷结拜，和邓同时“汗马立功”，得任“靖边副司令”，现已六十多岁。孙文化程度高，思想还开明，反动政权也因之拉拢他并且在前年率领“彝族观光团”到重庆、成都、南京、上海参观，以作办学校提高彝族文化程度的准备。邓德亮则在母亲吕仙支使下，随时压榨彝族人民，三年前且无故杀死拖乌的一位彝族领袖，彝族人民早已怀恨在心。然而蒋介石爱“才”，要他去南京步兵学校受训，毕业后蒋介石任命他恢复父职“宁属靖边司令”，同时任命邓舅为“夷兵团”团长。这一命令为宁属彝族人知道了，觉得魔王要返任，大起不满，刘文辉也表示异议。为了平民忿，贺国光才请改任孙仿为“宁属靖边代司令”，邓德亮调为“夷兵团长”。野心勃勃的邓德亮等不服，遂召集旧部，孙仿也不稍待，陈兵相候。二月，邓德亮在其父老巢泸沽以“靖边司令”名义“讨伐”孙仿，于是干戈相见，之后，邓德亮抄掳了孙仿部众的家属，孙仿也解决了邓德亮一营兵。此时，各地彝族纷纷发难袭击汉人，贺国光怕“夷人”下山，于是决定调伪一三六师，这种种族纷争；同时又为反动统镇压治集团利用为内部斗争的工具，伪“中央”嫡系的王陵基、杨森等就以西康旅渝同乡会的名义，发出了呈请伪西南长官公署将刘文辉撤职查办的代电。十分明显，反动集团又利用种族纠纷来制造争权夺利的机会了。
    　　　　马列主义能合理的解决民族问题
    上列彝族问题，就说明着国民党反动集团是怎样的在制造种族仇恨，假借大汉民族优越理论来加多反动集团的利益。这也就说明着旧民主主义（资产阶级的民主主义）的反动性。如：旧三民主义是主张“反满兴汉”的，即是反对当时的统治者满族，而同时提倡大汉族主义（如“血统”“国族”观点及大亚细亚主义等）。反满当然有其时代进步意义，但大汉族主义却又把人类推回到种族倾轧的深渊中，一般说这对于以谋利、找剥削的反动统治阶级是有利的；但对于整个人类以及人类绝大多数的劳动工农却一无好处。正如斯大林所说：“私有财产制度和资本不可避免地要拆散民族的团结、加强民族间的不和与加剧民族压迫，而集体所有制度和劳动也同样不可避免地把民族团结在一起，消除民族间的不和和摧毁民族压迫。”（斯大林：“民族问题和列宁主义”）
    在中国，反动的蒋介石匪帮在国际间努力制造不和，在国内的民族问题上，所表现的行径正如上述，叫嚣大汉族主义，所谓“五族共和”已在“大汉族主义”的种族优越论下折腰，国内各民族从“民国”以来就没有一天得安宁，不是进攻蒙古，便是防备维族，不是排斥满族，便是欺压苗族；再看解放区，却正根据马列主义和毛泽东思想，从全世界各民族的人民群众（即全人类共同）的根本利益出发，在国内则从全国人民共同的根本利益出发，现在中国共产党正是这样的在团结着国内各民族，来解除并坚决反对任何形式的民族压迫。
    不久的将来，彝族人民的苦痛运命将随着全国的解放一同绝迹，阳光已射向了大凉山。
