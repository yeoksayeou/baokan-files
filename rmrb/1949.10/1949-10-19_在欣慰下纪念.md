Commemorating Under Gratifying Circumstances
    Xu Guangping

    October, this great day of commemoration in human history. Our motherland, having just celebrated the founding of the People's Republic of China on the first day of this month, is now, in less than twenty days, in this brand-new capital, commemorating the thirteenth anniversary of the death of Mr. Lu Xun, who devoted his life to the literary revolution and used literature as a weapon for political struggle. We feel an immense sense of gratification.

    Because during Lu Xun's lifetime, it was the great era of the Chinese people's anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle. As a member of the struggle, he stood firmly at his post, constantly inflicting merciless blows on the enemy.

    Lu Xun's early literary movement began by introducing the works of oppressed nations in Northern Europe, as well as the voices of other revolutionary poets, while he himself was also "Nahan" (Outcry). However, from his work experience, he understood that fighting alone could not produce great results. While "Holding a Halberd" in pursuit of answers, he felt "Pang Huang" (Hesitation), and then turned to find "new recruits," so he kept approaching young people and striving to find the right collaborators. Therefore, he helped the young people of the Unnamed Society and others to introduce Soviet works, and at the same time, he also read Marxist-Leninist books. As early as before leaving Beijing (1926) to go to Xiamen, from his collection, we saw books such as "Marxism and Jurisprudence," "Tolstoy and Marx," "Proletarian Culture," "Proletarian Culture Theory," "Art and the Proletariat," "Proletarian Art Theory," "Tactics of Literature," and "Literature and Revolution." It can be said that he had already breathed the education of proletarian theory very early on. After coming into contact with the actual lessons of blood from the Great Revolution of 1927, Lu Xun became even more certain of his conviction in the leadership of the proletariat, and his wholehearted loyalty to fight to the end under its leadership! No matter what kind of oppression the enemy gave, he bravely stood up and admitted with his mouth and pen that he was a member of the League of Left-Wing Writers, fearlessly showing the enemy the progress of the struggle work of the League of Left-Wing Writers. In "On Our Current Literary Movement," there are these words:

    "The League of Left-Wing Writers" has been leading and fighting for the past five or six years, and it is the movement of proletarian revolutionary literature. This literary movement has been developing; and now it is developing more concretely and more practically to the mass literature of the national revolutionary war. The mass literature of the national revolutionary war is a development of proletarian revolutionary literature, and will soon be cultivated on this basis by the actual combat life, and open up brilliant flowers... Converging all struggles into the general stream of anti-Japanese and anti-traitor struggle (using the current facts, it is to oppose American imperialism and defeat the Kuomintang reactionaries. - Guangping note)... Making its responsibilities heavier and larger, heavy and large enough to make the entire nation, regardless of class and party, unite to deal with foreign enemies. This national stance is truly the stance of the class.

    This class stance has always been and still is the indicator of revolutionary literature. Lu Xun, as a literary worker at the time, fully accepted the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party through the "League of Left-Wing Writers"; in his article, he made the following statement:

    I have seen and support the policy of the anti-Japanese united front put forward by the revolutionary party to the national people. I unconditionally join this front. The reason is because I am not only a writer, but also a Chinese, so this policy is considered very correct to me.

    With the correct leadership, Lu Xun's work was no longer his own personal expression, but the entire Chinese people were in a common and consistent grand ensemble.

    Who is the conductor of this grand ensemble? Undoubtedly, it is Chairman Mao, the wise leader whom all Chinese people support today. In Lu Xun's reply to the Trotskyists, when the Trotskyists "condemned Mr. Mao Zedong's 'united front against Japan' as a betrayal of the revolution," Lu Xun refuted:

    Those who are practical, standing firmly on the ground, and fighting for the survival of the Chinese people and shedding blood, I have to regard them as comrades, and I am honored. Facts prove that the policies of the Chinese Communist Party under the leadership of Chairman Mao are correct, leading to today's achievements. In his opening speech at the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Chairman Mao instructed us:

    For more than a hundred years, our ancestors have never stopped fighting against internal and external oppressors with unyielding struggles... We united and defeated the internal and external oppressors with the People's Liberation War and the People's Great Revolution, and announced the establishment of the People's Republic of China. Our nation will henceforth be included in the big family of peace-loving and freedom-loving nations of the world, working with courage and diligence, creating its own civilization and happiness, and at the same time promoting world peace and freedom. Our nation will no longer be an insulted nation. We have stood up.

    How gratifying it should be to commemorate the thirteenth anniversary of Lu Xun when we have stood up! Recalling the tenth anniversary, I once wrote: "Democracy and freedom, what I trust, must be achieved before I can rest in peace." Now it is truly possible to rest in peace. At the Shanghai literary and art conference on July 4th this year, a friend told me affectionately: "In this venue, it seems that Mr. Lu Xun is with us." Hearing this sentence, I put away the tears that were almost falling. Indeed, on every great occasion, people will remember Lu Xun and feel that he should be with us at this time. However, "Only ask for cultivation, not harvest." This is the highest virtue of hardworking workers. Now, even if Lu Xun is not with us, the results of the efforts of thousands of comrades, just as Chairman Mao said at the preparatory meeting of the new political consultative conference:

    The Chinese people will see that once the fate of China is in the hands of the people themselves, China will rise like the sun in the East, illuminating the world with its brilliant light, quickly washing away the mud and sewage left by the reactionary government, healing the wounds of war, and building a brand-new and truly worthy of the name People's Republic of China.

    We are gratified that today we are commemorating Mr. Lu Xun, who fought against the enemy and supported this bright future, in the brand-new People's Republic of China. We should also celebrate the great achievements we have obtained by following the banner of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the leader of the People's Republic of China. Let the past be the past! From this year on, under the People's Republic of China, we can commemorate, study, criticize, and learn from Lu Xun as much as possible. The literary heritage and struggle experience can be properly evaluated for absorption or rejection.

### 在欣慰下纪念

　　在欣慰下纪念
    许广平
    十月，这伟大人类历史的纪念日，我们的祖国，刚刚在这个月的第一天庆祝了中华人民共和国的成立，而在不到二十天功夫，我们就在这一个簇新的国都来进行纪念那毕生从事文学革命，以文学这武器进行政治斗争的这位鲁迅先生的逝世十三周年，是感觉无比的欣慰的。
    因为鲁迅活着的时候，正是中国人民反帝、反封建的大时代，作为斗争的一员的他，是坚强地站在自己的岗位上，不断给予敌人以无情的打击的。
    鲁迅初期的文学运动，开始就是介绍北欧被压迫民族的作品，及其他革命诗人的呼声，而自己亦在“呐喊”着。但从工作的经验上，使他明白了单人匹马，独自奋斗是产生不出很大的效果的。在“荷戟”求索中感到“彷徨”，转而寻找“生力军”，于是不断和青年接近，努力觅取正确的合作者。因而帮助未名社等的青年们介绍苏联作品，同时自己也阅读马列主义的书籍，早在未离开北京（一九二六年）到厦门去以前，从他的藏书中，我们就看到有如“马克思主义与法理学”，“托尔斯泰与马克思”，“无产阶级的文化”，“无产者文化论”，“艺术与无产阶级”，“无产阶级艺术论”，“文学的战术论”，“文学与革命”等的书籍。可以说很早他就已经呼吸着无产阶级理论的教育了。待接触到一九二七年大革命血的实际教训，就更加确定了鲁迅对无产阶级领导的确信，和全心全意在它领导下忠诚奋斗到底！不管敌人给予怎样的压迫，还是勇敢地站起来用口和笔承认自己是左冀作家联盟的一员，无畏地昭示给敌人以左冀作家联盟的斗争工作经过，在“论现在我们的文学运动”就有这些话：
    “左冀作家联盟”五六年来领导和战斗过来的，是无产阶级革命文学的运动。这文学运动，一直发展着；到现在更具体底地，更实际斗争底地发展到民族革命战争的大众文学。民族革命战争的大众文学，是无产阶级革命文学的一发展，并且即将在这基础之上，再受着实际战斗生活的培养，开起烂熳的花来罢。……将一切斗争汇合到抗日反汉奸（用现在的事实，是反美帝击溃国民党反动派集团了。——广平注）斗争这总流里去。……将它的责任更加重，更放大，重到和大到要使全民族，不分阶级和党派，一致去对外。这个民族的立场，才真是阶级的立场。
    这个阶级的立场，一直是而且至今还是革命文学的指标。鲁迅当时作为一个文学工作者，通过了“左冀作家联盟”这一机构，全心全意接受中国共产党的领导；在他的文章里，就有如下的表明：
    中国目前革命的政党向全国人民所提出的抗日统一战线的政策，我是看见的，我是拥护的，我无条件地加入这战线，那理由就因为我不但是一个作家，而且是一个中国人，所以这政策在我是认为非常正确的。
    有了正确的领导之后，鲁迅的一切工作，不再是他自己个人的独自表现，而是全中国人民，都在共同一致的大合奏里了。
    这大合奏的指挥者是谁呢？无疑地就是今天我们全中国人民拥护的英明领袖毛主席。在鲁迅答托洛斯基派的信里，对托派“斥毛泽东先生们的‘各派联合一致抗日’的主张为出卖革命”时，鲁迅驳复的话是：
    那切切实实，足踏在地上，为着现在中国人的生存而流血奋斗者，我得引为同志，是自以为光荣的。事实证明着中国共产党的政策在毛主席领导之下的正确，以至有今天的成就。在中国人民政治协商会议上毛主席的开幕辞指示给我们：
    一百多年以来，我们的先人以不屈不挠的斗争反对内外压迫者，从来没有停止过，……我们团结起来，以人民解放战争和人民大革命打倒了内外压迫者，宣布中华人民共和国的成立了。我们的民族将从此列入爱好和平自由的世界各民族的大家庭，以勇敢而勤劳的姿态工作着，创造自己的文明和幸福，同时也促进世界的和平和自由。我们的民族将再也不是一个被人侮辱的民族了，我们已经站起来了。
    在站起来了的时候纪念鲁迅的十三周年，该是多么值得欣快呀！回忆十周年纪念的时候，我曾经写过：“民主自由，我所信赖，必期有成，再行告慰。”现在真是可以告慰的了。在今年七月四日上海文艺界大会里有一位朋友，亲切地告诉我：“在这个会场里，我们好象有鲁迅先生和我们在一起。”听了这句话，我把几乎快要掉下的泪水收起来了。的确，每逢伟大的场合里，人们就会记起鲁迅，就会觉得他这时应该和我们在一起。然而“只问耕耘，不问收获”。这是辛勤的劳动者最高的美德。现在鲁迅即使不和我们在一起了，千千万万同志们所努力的结果，正如毛主席在新的政治协商会议筹备会上所讲的话一样：
    中国人民将会看见，中国的命运一经操在人民自己的手里，中国就将如太阳升起在东方那样，以自己的辉煌的光焰普照天地，迅速地荡涤反动政府留下来的污泥浊水，治好战争的创伤，建设起一个崭新的名副其实的中华人民民主共和国。
    我们欣快于今天在崭新的中华人民共和国来纪念为此战斗过敌人，拥护过这光明的前途的鲁迅先生，则我们更应该庆贺我们由于遵循在中国共产党及中华人民共和国领袖毛主席旗帜之下才获得了这伟大的成果。过去了的让它过去吧！从今年起，在中华人民共和国之下，我们对鲁迅得以尽量纪念、研究；展开批评，学习。使文学遗产，斗争经验，可以获得适当的评价，以从事吸收，或扬弃了。
