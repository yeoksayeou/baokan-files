　　Beijing People's Court Opens
    Trial of German Priest for Crimes
    Judged Guilty of Illegal Detention and Insult
    [Beijing News] The illegal detention of six students, including He Cong from Fu Jen Boys' High School, by German priest Zeng Dewang and German priest Ji Futai has aroused public outrage in Beijing. The victims, He Cong and the other five students, have filed a lawsuit with the Beijing People's Court, demanding that they be punished according to the law. The court held a trial yesterday (8th) at 9:00 am, with more than a hundred students from Peking University, Normal University, and Fu Jen High School attending as observers. In addition to the plaintiffs and defendants, witnesses Wang Zhongsan, Fu Jen High School teachers Yu Rulin and Liang Cai, and Fu Jen High School Director Zhao Dongzheng also appeared in court. The defendants' associates included German priests Long A'de, Zhong Pan Shi, Guan Demei, American Ruike Ni, and the school workers Sun Degui, Ma Qishan, and the school secretary-general Zhang Chongyi, who helped Ruike Ni with translation. After the announcement of the opening of the court, Judge Li Fenglin first reported on the facts of the investigation of Zeng and Ji's illegal detention of Fu Jen High School student He Cong and others at the Gong Wang Mansion on October 4th and 5th. He then ordered the defendants to leave the court, and the plaintiff's representative, He Cong, stated the origin of the facts and the reasons for accusing German priest Zeng Dewang and German priest Ji Futai. Witness Wang Zhongsan, the chairman of the student union, reported on the negotiations with Zeng and Ji on that day. Witnesses Yu Rulin (teacher at Fu Jen High School) and Liang Cai testified that what He Cong and Wang Zhongsan said was factual and signed a statement. After a five-minute break, the court continued. The defendant Zeng Dewang admitted in court that he ordered Sun Degui to put on the lock, but did not admit to illegal detention and infringement of human rights. Ji Futai's confession and the statements of priests Long A'de, Zhong Panshi, and Guan Demei, in addition to shirking responsibility, had many contradictions. The students pointed these out one by one, and the debate lasted for more than two hours. Finally, Judge Li Fenglin announced the end of the debate and analyzed the case, saying: Fu Jen High School students He Cong and others went to the Gong Wang Mansion to collect pine branches. As proven during the debate, when He Cong and others arrived at the west gate of the Gong Wang Mansion, Long A'de only said that they were not allowed to enter the west gate and could enter the north gate. This shows that Long A'de agreed to enter the north gate to collect pine branches. Secondly, regarding the issue of the right to use the Gong Wang Mansion, the plaintiff claimed it was public property used by the school, while the defendant claimed it was only for the church to use. However, school secretary Zhang Chongyi and Director Zhao (standing director and member of the school committee) both testified that the school committee had not decided that the right to use the Gong Wang Mansion was only for the church to use. Therefore, it was permissible for He and the other six to go to the Gong Wang Mansion to collect pine branches. Zeng and Ji had no evidence to prove that the lock was taken by He Cong and others, and the time of the loss, according to Zeng and Ji, was around 12 o'clock on September 25th. However, He Cong and the other six arrived at the Gong Wang Mansion after 1 o'clock, which proves that the loss of the lock had nothing to do with He Cong and others. Finally, Zeng Dewang did not admit that he "detained" the students, but admitted that he "held" them. In short, regardless of detention or holding, when Zeng and Ji knew that He and others were Fu Jen High School students, without the consent of the People's Government Public Security Bureau or the judicial authorities, they used the loss of the lock as an excuse to detain them. Regardless of the length of time, it was an illegal act. Accusing He Cong and others of stealing the lock without evidence is an act of insult. Therefore, it is confirmed that Zeng Dewang and Ji Futai committed the crimes of illegal detention and insult. At this point, the secretary read the trial process and adjourned the court. The date of sentencing will be announced separately.

　　京市人民法院昨开
    审讯捷德籍犯法神甫
    判定为非法拘留及污辱罪
    【北京讯】捷籍神甫曾德望、德籍神甫纪福泰非法扣留辅仁男中学生何琮等六人，已激起了北京市各界人民的公愤，被害人何琮等六人已于日前向北京市人民法院起诉，要求依法惩处。该院于昨（八）日上午九时开庭审讯，有北大、师大、辅中等校学生百余人参加旁听。出庭人除原被告双方外，尚有证人王仲三、辅中教员俞汝霖、梁采及辅中主任赵东征等四人，被告关系人德籍神甫龙阿德、仲磐石、关德美、美籍芮克尼及该校工人孙德贵、马歧山及帮助芮克尼翻译的该校秘书长张重一等。宣布开庭后审判员李凤林首先报告十月四、五两日亲到曾犯等非法扣留辅仁附中学生何琮等的恭王府调查事实经过后，命被告退席，然后由原告代表何琮陈述事实发生原委，及控告捷籍神甫曾德望、德籍神甫纪福泰的理由。证人学生会主席王仲三报告当日与会、纪两人交涉经过，证人俞汝霖（辅仁中学教员），梁采证明何琮、王仲三所谈皆为事实并具结，休息五分钟后继续开庭，被告曾德望在庭上承认是他命孙德贵上的锁，但不承认为非法拘留妨害人权事。纪福泰的供词及龙阿德、仲磐石、关德美等神甫的声述除推卸责任外，前后矛盾处颇多，经同学一一指证，辩论达两小时余。最后审判员李凤林宣布辩论终结，分析该案情谓：辅中学生何琮等六人至恭王府采松树枝，经辩论时证明，何琮等六人至恭王府西门时，龙阿德只是说不许进西门，可以进北门，此即说明龙阿德是同意进北门采松树枝的。其次是恭王府使用权问题，原告谓为属于学校使用的公产，被告谓为只许教会使用，而该校张重一秘书长与赵主任（校委会常委理事及委员）都证明恭王府使用权并未经校委会决议只由教会使用，故何等六人到恭王府采松枝是可以的。曾、纪二人并无任何证据证明该锁即为何琮等六人拿去，又丢销时间据会、纪二人说为九月廿五日十二点多钟，而何琮等六人至恭王府时已逾一点，由此证明丢锁事与何琮等六人无关。最后曾德望不承认是“拘留”学生，而承认是“留置”，总之不论拘留或留置，在曾、纪二人明知何等为辅仁附中学生时，既未经人民政府公安局或司法机关同意，即借丢锁事予以拘留，不论时间长短，皆为非法行为。无证据地诬赖何琮等偷锁，是污辱行为。因此，曾德望、纪福泰犯了非法拘留及污辱罪是确定了的。至此由书记宣读审判经过后退庭。宣判日期另行公布。
