Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 8th. Following the Soviet government's protest to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France on October 1 against the violation of the Potsdam Agreement and the creation of a separate West German puppet government, the governments of Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania have also lodged protests or issued statements to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France, expressing their protest and supporting the just position held by the Soviet Union in its note to the United States, Britain, and France. Czechoslovakia pointed out in its note of October 6 that the Bonn government cannot represent the real Germany because it cannot defend the real interests of Germany. The note strongly urged the implementation of the Soviet proposals on preventing division and concluding a peace treaty with Germany as soon as possible. In its note of October 6, the Polish government protested against the unilateral actions of the United States, Britain, and France in violation of the Potsdam Agreement. In a statement issued on October 3, the Hungarian government pointed out that those who had ruled Germany for decades in the spirit of imperialist militarism, and then in the spirit of Hitler's fascism, were still playing a major role in the newly formed West German government, which was a particularly dangerous fact. The note sternly condemned the governments of the United States, Britain, and France for violating the treaty both in letter and spirit, and that they had refused in the past and still refuse to repay the Hungarian property that the German fascists and their Hungarian henchmen had removed from Austria and the West German region. They also support and organize the remnants of the Horty and Szálasi armies who fled to the West, plotting to overthrow the Hungarian democratic system. A statement issued by the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on October 6 stated: "Romania is particularly concerned about the situation in Germany and the establishment of a unified, democratic, and peaceful Germany, because it was occupied by German troops in the First World War, and was pushed by Hitler into the anti-Soviet war of aggression in the Second World War." Bulgarian Foreign Minister Poptomov stated on October 6 that German militarism in West Germany is now being revived in order to serve imperialism, and has nothing in common with the goal of achieving peace and security with the people of Europe. The Bulgarian people are determined to do everything in their power, in conjunction with the efforts of other peace-loving peoples, especially the resolute efforts of the Soviet Union, to seek a solution to the German question in the spirit of the principles of the Potsdam Agreement. In its note, the Albanian government exposed the abandonment of the Potsdam Agreement and the agreement of this summer's Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference by the governments of the United States, Britain, and France, and declared: The Government of the People's Republic of Albania urges the Governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France to pay attention to their responsibility for this situation that constitutes a threat to peace, and urges them to respect the obligations under the Potsdam Agreement to rebuild Germany's unity and make it a democratic and peace-loving country.

　　捷波匈等国照会美英法三国
    抗议制造西德伪政府
    支持苏联正义立场
    【新华社北京八日电】继苏联政府于十月一日照会美英法三国政府，抗议该三国违反波茨坦协定制造西德分立傀儡政府后，捷、波、匈、罗、保、阿各国政府亦先后向美、英、法三国政府提出照会或发表声明，表示抗议，并支持苏联致美、英、法三国照会所持的正义立场。捷克斯洛伐克在十月六日的照会中指出：波恩政府不能代表真正的德国，因为它不能保卫德国的真正利益。照会力促履行苏联关于制止分裂与及早缔订对德和约的建议。波兰政府于十月六日照会中，抗议美英法三国违反波茨坦协定的片面行动。匈牙利政府在十月三日发表的声明中指出：数十年来都以帝国主义黩武主义的精神来统治德国，随后又以希特勒法西斯主义精神来统治德国的那些人士，仍在新成立的西德政府扮演着主要的角色，这是特别危险的事实。照会严辞斥责美英法三国政府在文字与精神上都违反了和约，它们过去和现在都拒绝偿还德国法西斯及其匈牙利走狗从奥国与德国西区移走的匈牙利财产。它们并支持和组织着逃亡到西方的霍尔第和查拉绥军队的残余，阴谋推翻匈牙利民主制度。罗马尼亚政府外交部在十月六日发表的声明中指出：“罗马尼亚特别关切德国的局势与统一、民主与和平的德国之建立，因为它曾在第一次世界大战中被德国军队占领，而在第二次世界大战中又被希特勒推入反苏侵略战争。”保加利亚外交部长波普托莫夫十月六日发表声明称：目前西德的德国军国主义又在被复活，以便为帝国主义服务，而达成与欧洲人民的和平与安全毫无相同之处的目的。保加利亚人民决将竭尽一切力量，协同其他爱好和平人民的努力，首先是苏联的坚毅努力，寻求依照波茨坦协定原则的精神来解决德国问题。阿尔巴尼亚政府在其照会中揭露美、英、法三国政府背弃波茨坦协定与今夏巴黎外长会议的协议，并宣称：阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府，敦促美国、英国和法国政府注意其对于此种构成对和平威胁的局势所负的责任，并敦促尊重由波茨坦协定所承担的、关于重建德国的统一使之成为民主与爱好和平国家的义务。
