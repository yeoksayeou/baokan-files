Comrade Peng Zhen's Opening Remarks at the Inaugural Meeting of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association of Beijing

Our Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association is now formally established after more than a month of preparation. In a short period of time, it has grown to 125,000 members, becoming the largest mass organization in the city. This shows that the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people has an unparalleled deep material and spiritual foundation. The interests of China and the Soviet Union, the two countries and their people, and the spirit of "serving the working people" and "striving for the greatest interests of the greatest number of people" are completely consistent. The friendship built on this foundation is solid and unshakable.

Everyone remembers that at the beginning of the liberation of Beijing, due to the long-term slanderous, distorted, and dogmatic anti-Soviet propaganda conducted by the imperialists and the Kuomintang reactionaries, many people did not have a clear understanding of the Soviet Union. In some groups of people, there remained traces of the "anti-Soviet" sentiment created by the enemy's counter-propaganda. Now, all the enemy's counter-propaganda has been shattered by iron-like facts and the increased awareness of the masses. Slander and rumors cannot defeat the truth, and dark clouds cannot obscure the sun forever. Through long-term liberation struggles and personal experience, the Chinese people have fully recognized who is the enemy and who is the friend, and recognized that the Soviet Union is the most reliable friend of the Chinese people. They have seen with their own eyes that the Soviet Union's October Revolution awakened the Chinese people, pointed out the path of liberation for the Chinese people, and introduced and taught the Chinese people the most progressive revolutionary weapon - Marxism-Leninism; while the imperialists used all kinds of deception and "spiritual opium" to anesthetize the Chinese people, attempting to keep the Chinese people permanently impoverished, permanently ignorant, and forever their docile slaves. After the founding of the Soviet Union, it quickly and voluntarily abolished all unequal treaties imposed on China by the Tsarist government; while the imperialists stubbornly and continuously intensified their aggression and oppression against China. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Soviet Union firmly and consistently provided spiritual and material assistance to China's resistance against Japan; while the American imperialists were still transporting gasoline and scrap iron to the Japanese warlords, used to slaughter the Chinese people, until the eve of the Pacific War. After Japan's surrender, the Soviet Union insisted on eradicating the remnants of Japanese fascist militarism in order to consolidate the victory of the world's anti-fascist struggle and the Chinese people's War of Resistance Against Japan; while the American imperialists adopted a policy of "supporting Japan against China," and supplied a large amount of military weapons to the Kuomintang to slaughter the Chinese people, attempting to make China a colony of the United States. The Soviet Union wholeheartedly sympathized with the Chinese people's liberation movement, so on the second day after the founding of the People's Republic of China was announced, it immediately recognized the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China as China's only legitimate government, while the imperialists, because of their vicious hostility towards us, were caught off guard in an embarrassing situation and continued to make trouble for us. Isn't it clear that the Soviet Union is the most sincere and reliable friend of the Chinese people, and the imperialists are the deadly enemy of the Chinese people?

Now, let's look at the performance of the Soviet experts working under the leadership of the Municipal Government: their words and deeds fully demonstrate their friendship towards the Chinese people. They unreservedly teach us all the scientific theories and technical knowledge. They cherish our machines and materials. They feel distressed when they see sparrows eating public grain or discarded parts in the tram company. They care about the health of the Chinese people. When they see a toilet near a tap water well, they immediately ask: "How can this maintain the cleanliness of drinking water and protect the health of the citizens?" They work hard and diligently, but do not ask for any special rewards. The worker comrades said that Soviet experts are completely different from American experts, and some people feel a little strange about their selfless performance. But what is so strange about this? This is great internationalism, this is the noble quality of the socialist Soviet people educated by the great Lenin and Stalin, this is the Soviet Union's friendship towards the Chinese people. Haven't we Chinese communists been serving the Chinese people with such a spirit of self-sacrifice for the past twenty-eight years? The Chinese communists are students of Lenin, Stalin, and the Soviet Communist Party, and Chairman Mao is the best student of Lenin and Stalin. If you understand the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, you can also understand the Soviet communists and the Soviet people nurtured by Lenin and Stalin.

The Soviet Union is our teacher, and we have already achieved the basic victory of the Chinese revolution by taking him as our teacher. Our construction must also take the Soviet Union as our teacher. The Soviet Union has thirty-two years of construction experience, and this experience is the most progressive and valuable in the world. We should and must learn from the Soviet Union. Only in this way can we develop our construction undertakings at the fastest speed and achieve decisive victories on the construction front. We must make all the people understand that strengthening Sino-Soviet friendship and cooperation is in the highest interests of the Chinese people. Whoever undermines the friendship and cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet people is undermining the fundamental interests of the Chinese people.

Now that the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has been established, we should immediately intensify the following tasks:

First, continue to widely and deeply carry out propaganda and education on Sino-Soviet friendship, and thoroughly eliminate the residual influence of the anti-Soviet and anti-communist propaganda spread by the imperialists and the Kuomintang in the past.

Second, continue to develop membership in the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and expand the organization of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, using a strong organization to consolidate and develop the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people.

Third, quickly establish branch associations and sub-branch associations in various factories, schools, and organizations. Each branch association and sub-branch association should have a certain number of cadres with work ability who are specifically responsible for the work of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, in order to ensure the regular progress of the association's affairs, so as to avoid the tendency of having many calls but little actual work.

Fourth, launch Russian language learning activities. Now we are very short of translation talents. When Chinese and Soviet friends get together, they often lack translators; at the same time, many Soviet publications cannot be read, so sometimes we all become mutes, deaf, and blind. In order to solve this problem, we must have a large number of people actively learn Soviet languages, otherwise, we will not be able to smoothly and quickly learn from the rich experience of the Soviet Union.

Fifth, libraries and reading rooms should be established in various districts, major factories, schools, and organizations as much as possible. Members should be organized to read books and publications introducing the situation and experience of the Soviet Union.

Sixth, Soviet films, songs, dances, and dramas should be performed in a planned manner.

These are some of the specific tasks we are currently undertaking to consolidate and develop Sino-Soviet friendship.

Finally, let us shout:

Long live Sino-Soviet friendship!
Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!
Long live Marshal Stalin!

　　北京市中苏友好协会成立会上
    彭真同志的开会词
    我们北京市中苏友好协会，经过一个多月的筹备，现在正式成立了。在短短的期间，它已发展到十二万五千会员，成为目前本市最大的群众团体。这说明中苏两国人民的友谊是有着无比深厚的物质基础和精神基础的。中苏两个国家和两国人民的利害及“为劳动人民服务”“为最大多数人民的最大利益而奋斗”的精神都是完全一致的，建筑在这种基础上的友谊，是巩固不可动摇的。
    大家还记得在北京解放之初，由于帝国主义和国民党反动派曾进行了长期的诬蔑、歪曲和武断的反苏宣传，因而曾有许多人对苏联认识不清楚，在一部分群众中曾残存着由敌人的反宣传所造成的“反苏”空气，现在所有敌人的反宣传，已被铁一般的事实和群众觉悟的提高打得粉碎了。诬蔑和造谣是不能战胜真理的，乌云终究遮不住太阳。中国人民在长期解放斗争和亲身体验中，已充分认清了谁是敌人谁是朋友，认清了苏联乃是中国人民最可靠的朋友。他们亲眼看见苏联的十月革命唤醒了中国人民，指示了中国人民以解放的道路，介绍并教给了中国人民以最进步的革命武器——马列主义；而帝国主义者却用各样各色的欺诈和“精神的鸦片”来麻醉中国人民，企图使中国人民永久穷困，永久愚昧，永远作他们的柔顺奴隶。苏联建国之后，很快即自动废除了沙皇政府所加于中国的一切不平等条约；而帝国主义却坚持地不断地在加紧着对中国的侵略与压迫。抗战期间，苏联自始至终坚决地从精神上和物质上来援助中国的抗日；而美帝国主义者直到太平洋战争发生的前夜，却还在运输汽油和废铁供给日本军阀，用来屠杀中国人民。在日本投降以后，苏联坚持必须根绝日本法西斯的军国主义的残余，以巩固世界反法西斯斗争与中国人民抗日战争的胜利；而美帝国主义者所采取的却是“扶日对华”的政策，并以大批的军火武器供给国民党屠杀中国人民，企图使中国成为美国的殖民地。苏联是彻头彻尾地同情中国人民解放运动的，所以他在中华人民共和国宣告成立的第二天，就立即承认我中华人民共和国中央人民政府是中国唯一合法的政府，而帝国主义者却因为对我们抱着凶恶的敌意，而手忙脚乱陷于窘境，并继续向我们捣乱。苏联是中国人民最真诚，最可靠的朋友，而帝国主义乃是中国人民之死敌，这还不明白么？
    我们现在再拿正在本市市政府领导下工作的苏联专家的表现来看：他们的一言一行都充分表现了他们对于中国人民的友谊。他们毫无保留地把科学理论和技术知识全部教给我们。他们爱护我们的机器、物资，他们看见麻雀吃公粮，看到电车公司有被遗弃的零件，就觉得心疼的不得了。他们关心中国人民的健康，他们看到自来水井附近有厕所，立刻就问：“这样如何能保持饮水的清洁，保护市民的健康？”他们埋头艰苦工作，却不要求任何特殊的报酬。工人同志们说，苏联专家和美国专家完全不同，并有人感觉他们的大公无私的表现，有点奇怪，可是，这有什么奇怪呢？这就是伟大的国际主义，这就是伟大的列宁、斯大林所教育出来的社会主义苏联人民的高尚的品质，这就是苏联对于中国人民的友谊。我们中国共产党人二十八年来不就是这样地以自我牺牲精神来为中国人民服务么？中国共产党人是列宁、斯大林和苏联共产党的学生，毛主席是列宁、斯大林最好的学生，你们认识了中国共产党，认识了毛主席，也就可以从此认识苏联共产党人和列宁、斯大林亲手所教养出来的苏联人民。
    苏联是我们的老师，我们以他为师已经取得了中国革命的基本胜利。我们的建设也要以苏联为师。苏联已经有了三十二年的建设经验，这些经验是全世界最进步最有价值的经验，我们应当，也必须向苏联学习，只有这样才能够以最快的速度来发展我们的各项建设事业，才能在建设战线上迅速获得决定的胜利。我们要使所有的人民群众了解，加强中苏友谊与合作，乃是中国人民的最高利益，谁要是破坏中苏两国人民的友谊与合作，谁就是破坏中国人民的根本利益。
    现在，中苏友好协会成立了，我们应该立即加紧进行下列工作：
    第一、继续广泛深入地进行有关中苏友好的宣传与教育，彻底肃清过去帝国主义者和国民党所散布的反苏、反共宣传的残余影响。
    第二、继续发展中苏友好协会会员，扩大中苏友好协会的组织，用强有力的组织，来巩固与发展中苏两国人民的友谊。
    第三、迅速建立各工厂、各学校和各机关的支会及支分会，各个支会和支分会应有一定数量有工作能力的专门负担中苏友好协会工作的干部，以保证会务的经常进行，以免发生号召多而实际工作少的倾向。
    第四、开展学习俄文活动。现在我们的翻译人才很缺，当两国友人相聚时，往往缺乏翻译；同时有许多苏联刊物也无法阅读，因而有时使我们大家变成了哑叭、聋子、瞎子。为了解决这个问题，我们必须有一大批人积极学习苏联语言文字，不然就无法顺利地迅速地学习苏联的丰富经验。
    第五、在各区、各大工厂、学校、机关中应尽可能设立图书馆、阅览室，应组织会员阅读介绍苏联情况和经验的书籍刊物。
    第六、有计划地演出苏联的电影、歌舞、戏剧等。
    这些就是我们当前巩固与发展中苏友谊的一些具体工作。
    最后，让我们高呼：
    中苏友好万岁！
    毛泽东主席万岁！
    斯大林大元帅万岁！
