　　Beijing Industrial Delegation
　　Arrives in Dalian for Visit
　　[Beijing News] The Capital Industrial Delegation arrived in Dalian at 4 PM on the 9th of this month. As the train entered the urban area of Dalian, all members of the delegation were immediately invigorated by the towering buildings and chimneys, as well as the clean and wide roads. Amidst the fluttering red flags, the giant statues of Mao Zedong and Stalin overlooked the bustling crowds. The delegation's visiting plan is to first visit the industrial exhibition, then visit large factories such as shipbuilding, automobile, and glass factories. The last few days will be organized as symposiums to collect materials needed by various departments. The scheduled stay is ten to twelve days.
