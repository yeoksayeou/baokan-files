　　The Black Rock Slope Coal Mine Chronicle (7)
    Kang Tuo
    While listening, Xilu also felt a bit happy; but he felt that he only had twenty-odd acres of land, and running around outside was just a small business, and he had always been afraid of getting involved with official matters, so he quickly said, "Aren't you making fun of me, sir! I'm not qualified for that! I don't have the ability!" Jubao interjected, "No! There are no outsiders here, and we won't beat around the bush; listen to me: what I'm thinking isn't just this. I'm almost fifty years old, and my body relies on two puffs of opium every day to keep going, I have no energy! I've long wanted to pass on my position as General Head and Village Chief, but I can't find anyone! Don't think that there are many rich landlords in our village, the truth is, we can't find anyone who can really do things. I think, you should take over as General Head for a few days first, and then my position as General Head and Village Chief, we'll have to hand it over to you!" Jubao's words were insincere, but these words were too rare! Xilu was so dumbfounded that he quickly pulled out his heart and said, "Oh, please don't say any more! I'm ten thousand miles away from you, sir! I'm not the Monkey King, how can I somersault so high? No, no, no! My life is just meant for suffering, I never even dared to dream of becoming a General Head, how could I take over your position! Jubao, the official matters of Black Rock Slope must be taken care of by you, and in the future, your sons will have to take over! The other General Heads in our village are all rich and noble, I'm just running errands for our community, I don't have the ability!" Jubao said, "Look at what you're saying! You're only in your forties, shrewd and capable, and now that you've opened this mine, your reputation in the village is established! With your ability to manage money, I don't believe you can't manage government affairs! Try it, try it! Xilu, take over as General Head first. How about it? Huh?" Xilu was sweating profusely, just trembling and saying, "I dare not, I dare not..." Jubao looked at him and was both angry and amused, thinking: this guy really is an incompetent businessman, let's teach him a lesson and scare him! So he pulled up his chair, sat closer to Xilu, and whispered slowly into his ear, "Besides, you're running a coal mine business, isn't it safer to handle some official business on the side? You know, in this day and age, even villages have to organize public defense groups and Communist youth leagues, and there may be unstable elements in the market and at the bottom of the mine. Now Governor Yan is running his own mine in Taiyuan, and he has also replaced the mine managers with people who handle both industrial administration and political affairs, and those who only care about industrial and commercial affairs and don't care about political affairs are not popular. You're out all day, you must know this world. Why don't you do it! Take over as General Head first, anyway, we'll take care of each other!" Jubao's intention was to say: anyway, you have to find me, this official backer, so that we can "take care of each other," and let me also taste the sweetness of the mine; if not, then in this day and age, what groups and elements, you have to be careful! But Xilu had already been stunned by the "General Head and Village Chief"; he was also most afraid of what groups and elements, and when he heard this, he was even more frightened, so he couldn't figure out the meaning of Jubao's words? He quickly said nothing, just muttering: "Oh... no, no..." Jubao repeated his meaning, but Xilu was still too confused, and only smoothed his breath and said, "I'm running a coal mine business, relying on skill and connections, being fair in my dealings, I don't provoke others, and others don't provoke me, no matter what the world is like, I'm paying taxes and fees, why should I curry favor with those who handle official business! In the village, I'll trouble you to take care of me, wouldn't that be enough!" Jubao saw that Xilu still didn't understand his meaning, and felt that this person was too incompetent, just as Governor Yan said: no political brain! He couldn't help but feel angry. But he still restrained himself, pretended to be kind, and asked Xilu, "Are you going to dig new air vents after the autumn, do you have enough money?" Xilu was just trying to change the subject and leave quickly, so he didn't hear the meaning of these words, just said: "After the autumn, I'll start with Lin Bao and the others, anyway, we'll deal with it! Hehe, I'll still have to ask you to help me out if I have difficulties!" Jubao heard these words, closed his eyes and smoothed his beard, still hoping to wait and see if Xilu would ask him to invest in the business as a shareholder; but Xilu said nothing, just got up to leave. Jubao was very annoyed, and even forgot about asking Xilu to report the opera accounts and become the General Head, and just casually dismissed him.
    Afterwards, Jubao also looked for Da San to test the waters, only to see that Da San was indeed as he had heard, awkward and rude, didn't even say hello to him, didn't say anything, and didn't look like someone who could do things for him; he swallowed his anger and said to Da San, "I called you for nothing else, just wanted to ask you, can my two small earth kilns be turned into big kilns. You can check it out for me!" Da San also didn't like Jubao, and said, "I don't have that kind of insight, and I don't have the time. You can hire another master!" Jubao's eyes suddenly turned red with anger, and just then, Bai Quan's wife came out to bring him boiled water, and Da San looked at the woman with lustful eyes, Jubao was even more unhappy, thinking: no matter how strong your skills are, if you don't honestly work for me, see if you can stay under me! Humph! Jubao waved his sleeve, sent Da San away, and asked Bai Quan's housekeeper to come out, and after the two discussed for a while, they sent someone to look for Yubao.
    He knew some things about Yubao. In the past, Yubao had also come to his house a couple of times, but he felt that that person would follow whoever had the advantage, was not loyal or honest, and besides, he had no use for Yubao, so he hadn't interacted with him much. This time he wanted to use him, and when they met, he quickly called him "Brother Yubao," and kept asking him to sit down, which made Yubao dizzy, so he had to sit halfway on the chair, turning his face and sticking out his ear to listen to Jubao speak, while constantly nodding. Jubao asked him how his family's life was, asked him about the situation of opening a big kiln with Xilu, talking and talking, as if unintentionally asked, "Didn't you say that the big kiln was being managed by you? How did Da San get involved?" This question hit Yubao's heart, but he couldn't say it directly, so he had to answer, "His skills are strong!" Jubao said, "Da San grew up in a big kiln outside, he's probably not as good as you at running an earth kiln!" Yubao didn't want to say anything bad, just "hmm hmm" twice, Jubao said some other things as if he didn't care, and then asked Yubao, "How much do you get paid a day as a casual foreman?" Yubao said, "Fifty cents." "What about Da San?" "He gets one silver dollar!" Jubao nodded and said to himself, "Hmm! That's like working for you for two days. One silver dollar! That's not even as good as a big machine kiln outside!" Yubao also said to himself, "Some outside also get one dollar, but most get eighty cents!" As the two of them were talking, Jubao felt that Yubao was still to his liking, and Yubao also felt that Jubao's words made him feel very comfortable. When he was about to leave, Jubao instructed Yubao, "I called you for nothing else, just to have you see if my two small earth kilns can be expanded into big ones. Keep an eye out!" Jubao also knew that Yubao smoked a bit of opium, so he asked Bai Quan's wife to give him a small packet of opium pills, he hurriedly took the paper bag, his heart was pounding, he couldn't figure out what Jubao was plotting, but he seemed to know a little something, and he left with an unclear matter in his heart.

    喜禄一边听，一边也有点高兴；但又觉着自己才二十来亩地，在外跑搭吧也不过是个小买卖人，自己又从来怕沾上官事的，就忙道：“这这不是耍笑人么，你老人家！咱可哪里够上那份资格！哪里是那份材料！”聚宝伸手插开话道：“不！这里也没外人，咱也不拐弯；你听我说：我心思的还不光就是这。我嘛快五十啦，这身子骨每天就靠两口大烟撑着，没精神啦！我这总社首跟村长早就想推出手，可寻不下个人！你别看咱村顷数来地的财主不少，真能干事的还就是寻不出。我看，你先顶两天社首，往后咱这总社首跟村长，还就得给你交代哩！”聚宝说这话，本是虚情假意，但这话太稀罕了！喜禄不禁吓懵了脑袋，只急得掏出良心说：“哎呀呀快别往下说！咱跟你老人家差上十万八千里哩！咱又不是孙猴子，就能一个斛头翻那么高？不行不行不行！我这人生就是个受苦的材料，一辈子心高妄想也想不到要当社首的，哪还能顶你老人家的事！聚宝，黑石坡的官事就得你老人家操劳，往后也只能是你少爷们接替！咱村别的社首们嘛，也都是有富有贵的，我就是给咱社里当差跑腿吧，也不够材料啊！”聚宝道：“你看你这说的！你才平四十子年岁，精明能干，如今开了这个窑，村里名声也札稳啦！以你那么会理财，我不信你不能理政事！试吧试吧吧！喜禄，先顶上个社首再说。就这吧？阿？”喜禄急得满脑袋直冒汗，光一个劲哆嗦着说：“可不敢可不敢……”聚宝看着他那架势，又生气，又觉得好笑，心想：这家伙果真是个没出息的买卖人，教训教训吓唬吓唬他吧！就拉拉椅子，靠近喜禄坐着，对着他耳根悄悄慢慢说：“再说，你滚窑干买卖的，捎带办个公事不是更保险么？你知道，如今这世道，连村里也要搞公道团防共团，买卖场中窑坑底下也不定没有不稳分子。这会阎督军在太原府自己办窑，也把窑上管事的换成了工政兼管的人，那些光务工商不问政事的人吃不开了。你成天出门，不能不知道这个世道。你干干吧！先顶上个社首再说，反正咱们彼此关照嘛！”聚宝这番话，原意本是说：反正你得找上我这个官靠山，好“彼此关照”，让我也尝尝窑上的甜头；如若是不的话，那如今这世道，什么团呀分子的，你可当心！不想喜禄早就被那“总社首兼村长”吓晕了脑袋；他又是从来最怕什么团呀分子的，一听说这，更怕得没了主心骨，哪还能揣摸透聚宝话里头的意思？连忙甚也不说，光噜嗦着：“哎呀呀……不行，不…不……”聚宝又把他的意思重说了一遍，喜禄还是昏得没怎么闹清，只平了平气说：“我这滚窑开买卖的，凭把式靠人缘，往来公平，人不惹我，我不惹人，什么世道我也是纳税掏款，跟那些办官事的攀亲认故干什么！村里边嘛，麻烦你老人家多关照不就行了！”聚宝见喜禄还没闹清他的意思，觉得这人太无能，真是阎督军说的：没有政治脑袋！不觉心中生气。但他还是忍了忍，装作好心好意，问喜禄道：“你那窑秋后还要凿新口透风筒嘛，你垫本宽裕么？”喜禄正想岔开话头赶紧走，因此也就没听透这话里的意思，只道：“秋后咱跟林宝他们碰股子闹，反正紧着对付吧！嘿嘿，有困难可还得你老人家打帮关照哩！”聚宝听了这话，就闭上眼睛理着胡子，还妄想等等，看喜禄到底请他入股子当东家不；喜禄却什么也没说，只是起身要走。聚宝挺没好气，连叫喜禄报戏帐当社首的事也早忘了，就把人家随便支应走了。
    此后聚宝又找大三来探了探虚实，只见大三这人果然象他听说过的那样，蹩蹩扭扭，对他也没个礼貌，也不说什么话，根本不象个能给他干事的人；他忍住了一口气，对大三说：“我叫你也没别的事，就想问讯问讯你，看我那两座小土窑也能闹成大窑不。你给咱察看察看吧！”大三也挺看不惯聚宝，就道：“咱没那份眼力，咱也没功夫。你另请把式吧！”聚宝猛一下眼睛也气红了，正在这时，白泉家出来给他送开水，大三又对着那女人＠＠地瞅了两眼，聚宝更不高兴，心想：你把式再强，可你妈的不安安份份地给老子使唤，看你能在老子手下呆下去！哼！聚宝就一挥袖子，打发走了大三，并让白泉家把他管家的叫出来，二人计议了一阵，便派人去寻玉宝。
    玉宝这人他是知道一些的。过去玉宝也曾上他家跑跳过两回，只是他觉着那人见谁有利就跟谁，不忠实不厚道，再说他也没有用玉宝的机会，就没多打过交道。这回他想用用了，见了面就忙称呼“玉宝兄弟”，还一个劲让坐，把个玉宝闹得迷迷糊糊地，只好半个屁股坐在椅子上，侧着脸伸出耳朵静听聚宝说话，一边不断点头。聚宝问他家里日子怎么样，问他跟喜禄开大窑的情形，说说道道，象是无意地又问道：“不是说大窑叫你经管领事的么？怎么又闹出个大三？”这句话正问对了玉宝的心事，但他又不好明说，只得答道：“人家把式强呗！”聚宝道：“大三是外边大窑长大的，闹土窑怕不如你懂行吧！”玉宝不好说什么长短，只得“唔唔”两声，聚宝又象是满不在意地说了些旁的，就问玉宝：“你当闲工头，一天多少供应？”玉宝说：“五毛钱。”“大三呢？”“他一块现洋！”聚宝点点头，自己说道：“唔！顶你干两天。一块现洋！这比外边机器大窑还比不上吧！”玉宝也自己说道：“外边也有一块的，可多数是八毛！”他二人这么捣拉着，聚宝觉得玉宝这人还中意，玉宝也觉着聚宝的话真说得他舒舒坦坦。临走，聚宝才吩咐玉宝道：“我叫你也没别事，就为的让你看看我那两座小土窑也能往大里扩展不。你留个心吧！”聚宝又知道玉宝也抽两口烟，就让白泉家给他拿了一小包大烟丸，他慌慌张张接过纸包，心中象十五个吊桶七上八下，摸不清聚宝到底要闹什么机谋，可又象知道了一点什么，心眼里闷着个不明不白的事情走了。
