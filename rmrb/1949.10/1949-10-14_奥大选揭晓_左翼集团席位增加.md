Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 12th: The Austrian general election was held on October 9th. According to TASS reports, the seat allocation based on the election results is as follows: Left-Wing Group (including the Communist Party and the League of Progressive Socialists) 5 seats (the Communist Party held 4 seats in the previous parliament); Austrian Socialist Party 67 seats (76 seats in the previous parliament); "People's Party" 77 seats (85 seats in the previous parliament); "League of Independents" 16 seats (no seats in the previous parliament).

The election results indicate that the ruling People's Party and Socialist Party both lost seats, while the Left-Wing Group not only maintained but also strengthened its position. The "People's Party" has also lost its original absolute majority in parliament. Austrian Communist Party Chairman Koplenig and Central Committee member Honner were elected as members of parliament in the fourth and ninth electoral districts respectively.

According to Agence France-Presse: The distribution of votes in the Austrian general election is as follows: Left-Wing Group 215,366 votes; People's Party 1,834,900 votes; Socialist Party 1,617,208 votes; League of Independents 489,126 votes. The Left-Wing Group received 7% of the total votes, but only won 3% of the parliamentary seats. The distribution ratio of votes and seats indicates that the newly elected parliamentarians do not fully reflect the actual influence of the Left-Wing Group.

Prior to the election, American imperialism exhausted all means to interfere with and suppress the election campaign of the left-wing group formed by the Austrian Communist Party and the League of Progressive Socialists (left-wing socialists), while manipulating the Socialist Party and the People's Party to actively "campaign." These two parties used American and British radio stations and newspapers in Austria, used American money to print slogans, launched anti-Soviet slanders, and intimidated and attacked the left-wing group. At the same time, they promulgated a decree pardoning approximately 750,000 former Nazis, openly allowing them to participate in the voting. The American and British occupation authorities, according to the so-called "Order No. 200," could arbitrarily execute any punishment (including the death penalty) on any Austrian, and thousands of Austrians were convicted or imprisoned under this order. Local organizations of the Austrian Communist Party were subjected to bandit-like searches. The American and British occupation authorities openly threatened to retaliate against those who supported the left-wing group after the election. Provocations and terror intensified especially on the night of the 8th and on election day. Slogans of the left-wing group in various towns and villages were torn down by special gangs formed by the government parties. Followers of right-wing parties patrolled the streets of many villages in Styria (British occupation zone) with wooden sticks from early morning. On the morning of the 9th, about twenty Socialist Party hooligans attacked the Vienna District Committee of the Communist Party. Senior priests of the Catholic Church actively interfered in the election.

　　奥大选揭晓
    左翼集团席位增加
    【新华社北京十二日电】奥地利大选已于十月九日举行。据塔斯社报道：选举结果议席分配如下：左翼集团（包括共产党与进步社会党人联盟）五席（上届议会中共产党占四席）；奥地利社会党六十七席（上届议会为七十六席）；“人民党”七十七席（上届议会为八十五席）；“独立者联盟”十六席（上届议会无席位）。
    选举结果表示：执政的人民党与社会党席位均有损失，而左翼集团则不仅保持而且加强了其地位。“人民党”并已失去其原来在议会中的绝对多数。奥共主席权仑民与中委昂纳分别在第四、第九两选区当选为议员。
    另据法新社讯：奥大选选票分配如下：左翼集团二十一万五千三百六十六票；人民党一百八十三万四千九百票；社会党一百六十一万七千二百零八票；独立者联盟四十八万九千一百二十六票。左翼集团得票占总票数百分之七，而当选议员却只有百分之三。选票与议席的分配比例表明，新选出的议员并不能完全表明左翼集团的实际影响。
    在选举之前，美帝国主义用尽一切方法干涉和镇压奥共与进步社会党人联盟（左翼社会党）所组成的左派集团的竞选运动，同时操纵社会党和人民党积极“竞选”。这两个党运用美英在奥的无线电台和报纸，用美国钱印发标语，发动反苏诽谤和对左派集团的威吓和攻击。同时，他们颁布法令，赦免了约七十五万名前纳粹分子，公然让他们参加投票。美英占领区当局根据所谓“第二百号命令”，可以擅自执行对任何奥国人的任何刑罚（包括死刑），成千奥人因这一命令被判罪或监禁，奥共各地组织横遭盗匪似的搜查。美英占领当局并公开威胁着要在选举以后对支持左翼集团的人们进行报复。挑衅和恐怖在八日整夜及选举日当天特别加紧。各地乡镇左派集团的标语被政府党所组成的特别匪帮撕去。右翼党派的徒众手执木棍，自清晨起即在斯的利亚州（英占区）的许多乡村的街道上巡逻。九日的早晨，约有二十名社会党的流氓袭击共产党维也纳区委员会。天主教会中高级牧师积极干预选举。
