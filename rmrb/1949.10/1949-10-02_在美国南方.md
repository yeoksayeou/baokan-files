　　In the American South

　　One spring, a friend and I traveled to the southern United States. Our aim was to cross the southernmost states to reach California. It was said that springtime was the best time to travel this route, as the South was not yet unbearably hot, but the tropical, lush atmosphere was already abundant. By the time summer arrived and the South became too hot, we would have already left it for the golden, bright California.

　　My friend was of Northern European descent, with light chestnut hair, white skin with slightly nervous little yellow spots, and sharp, small, chestnut eyes that darted quickly, making her seem shrewd and capable, and sometimes a little unsteady. Despite this, her actions and speech usually displayed experience and a calm demeanor. Her name was Orga. We had agreed to travel together because of several speaking engagements in the South. Orga was involved with a group that opposed racial discrimination, hence her participation in these lectures.

　　I confess that I already had a prejudice against the American South, as it was notorious for its discrimination against Black people. I remember on the way to America, a steward on the ship (the journalist should forgive me for not stating his skin color. Think, on an American ship serving Chinese passengers, could the steward be anything other than Black? People with yellow skin, except in extremely special circumstances, could not find jobs in American institutions.) told me that he didn't feel like an American at all. In New York, the so-called city of freedom that held the Statue of Liberty aloft, I had also repeatedly heard about Harlem, an area that white people were unwilling to approach, as if it were a leper colony within New York City. In reality, it was just a Black residential area forcibly created by wealthy white people. In fact, the Black issue seemed to be synonymous with America, like a large boil growing on America's nose, visible from far out at sea, and you could smell its stench. Therefore, I was fully prepared for the South, such a boil-like area, and I didn't expect to find a paradise there.

　　Even so, after passing Washington, I already had a feeling on the train that I had entered a savage world. The carriages were still very beautiful. The white people still had their neck buttons buttoned neatly, their chins shaved as red as persimmons, and they were served by Black people in white coats. The dining room still had shiny silverware and porcelain, and the eggs on the plates, prepared in a civilized manner, were golden yellow, accompanied by a sprig of bright green parsley. The entire carriage seemed clean and beautiful, up to the standard of Western civilization. But within this civilized world, I had an unspeakable feeling of being in a savage world. There were originally two Black passengers in our carriage, but now they had suddenly disappeared. Perhaps they got off at a station. There were now no Black people in the dining car. At one end of the dining car, a thick velvet curtain hung deeply, tightly covering that small section, as if something unpresentable was hidden inside. Occasionally, as the curtain lifted, a bald-headed Black steward in a white coat emerged, holding a large tray of dishes high. In that instant, I glimpsed a dark, crowded mass of Black faces and Black heads wriggling, like a scene in a primitive forest. But this was only for a very short moment, and then the curtain was sealed again. The entire dining room remained brightly lit, with snow-white people chatting leisurely.

　　This situation astonished me. I must have stopped eating and drinking, staring at that strange curtain, because Orga nudged me and said in a disgusted tone:

　　"What are you looking at? Black people are eating in there. That's how they are discriminated against!" She stuck a piece of chicken with her fork into her mouth and continued to remind me in a very worldly way: Don't keep staring at that velvet curtain, or the discriminated-against Black people inside will get angry if they notice.

　　After the meal, driven by curiosity, I decided to walk through the entire train to see what this discrimination was all about. To be honest, although I was born in a multi-ethnic China, I had never seen one ethnicity order another ethnicity to be inferior humans. This seemed like the behavior of a barbaric age, completely incompatible with the gleaming so-called Western civilization before me. I didn't tell Orga and started my exploratory journey. I wanted to see the Black carriage, especially to find the two Black people who had been in our carriage. The woman among them had large, expressive eyes, and I thought she was beautiful.

　　After the train passed Washington, there seemed to be fewer passengers heading south, and the carriages seemed very empty. I walked through seven or eight carriages at once, there weren't many people, and not a single person with black skin. I was a little discouraged and was about to turn back when I suddenly found a carriage that was divided into two halves. One half was longer and was full of white people; the other half was shorter and was full of black people. This black half of the carriage seemed dark and dirty, probably because the carriage was too old, there was too little light, and it was crowded and messy. Soon I discovered that white eyes were focused on me from all directions in this half of the carriage. And surrounded by these cold, stern white eyes, I saw a pair of fierce eyes like two blades pointing straight at me. I felt terrified and quickly turned around and left. Even the black woman who had once shared a carriage with me looked at me with such a venomous gaze.

　　Back in my own carriage, I didn't tell Orga about my experience, and I just looked out the window, feeling angry. Orga looked at me nervously for a long time, as if she didn't understand why I was upset, and she didn't say anything.

　　The further south we went, the more of these indigestible experiences I had. Because I was with a white person, I felt as if I was always ambushing Black people, where he was, I wasn't, where I was, he wasn't. Even the streets were divided into Black and white. As for restaurants, hotels, waiting rooms, restrooms, streetcars, cars—white drivers wouldn't drive Black people, wouldn't enter Black areas—everything related to people was divided into two Black and white worlds, and when Black and white met, it was a white knife in, a red knife out. The only exception was probably when white men raped Black women. This outwardly sparkling American civilization hid a terrifying melee from the age of dinosaurs.

　　At first, I often brought this matter up with Orga for discussion. But she always acted as if she didn't want to say much. Her answers were simple and straightforward:

　　"Because it is like this, we must fight, we must eliminate it!" She didn't want to encourage me, she was afraid that I would accidentally offend Black progressives by expressing opinions casually in their presence. That would make her work even more difficult. Once, we were going to a speaking engagement in a Black area. It was only half an hour away, but she forced me to leave an hour earlier, saying that it was better for us to wait for the audience than for Black people to say that she was putting on white airs.

　　But the mayor of New Orleans absolutely refused to admit this fact. He enlightened me with a prescient attitude:

　　"Don't believe what those Yankees say. How would they know about our affairs if they're not in the South? They don't understand Black people either. Black people sincerely don't want to mix with white people. Isn't that right? Our America is free. Everyone should be free to live their lives in their own free way. Black people like the South, they like to be with their own kind. It's not that anyone is discriminating against them, it's that they want to separate themselves from us. You must know that our America is the freest country!"

　　This liar wronged many "Yankees." This kind of talk is something that Yankees, except for progressives, would also say and do. So I didn't find it strange, and I didn't need to give him any response. Black people themselves were already answering him with the facts every day.

　　We arrived in Texas. This is the largest state in the United States. Its people are said to be known for their toughness and pride. At the same time, this state is said to be the most enlightened in the South. The University of Texas at Austin is in its capital. This university had once had a president who lost his job for supporting Roosevelt's policies. When we arrived, the president had just been fired by the board of trustees. But his students couldn't bear to let him go. Therefore, taking advantage of our arrival, the students organized a party to bid him farewell and welcome us.

　　Beforehand, I had heard Orga discussing with the students about inviting representatives from several Black youth groups to attend this meeting. This was illegal. If the police found out, they would be jailed. Orga and the others wanted to rely on the progressive atmosphere of the university and the supposedly more enlightened reputation of Texas to do something unprecedented like this, to make a breakthrough against the reactionary rulers' laws.

　　That night, the atmosphere was really lively. The students also prepared a military band, Chinese and American flags, and the military band played the national anthems of both countries. The Chinese national anthem was replaced by the "March of the Volunteers." The president gave a speech, many people spoke, sang songs, and performed plays. But there was no Black program at all. And not a single Black representative arrived. I don't know how others felt, but I felt like I was in a fog, sitting there heavily until the end of the party.

　　After the party, Orga immediately dragged me through the crowd of people wanting autographs, got into a friend's car, and urged him to drive. It seemed like we were escaping, or on some secret mission. When I asked her, she just whispered in my ear, I couldn't hear what she was saying at all. The car wouldn't start. The owner seemed to be directing some action outside the car. Gradually, four or five people squeezed into our small car. They were whispering about where they were going, and at the same time, they were laughing and urging the car to hurry up, afraid of being too late. At this time, the car owner came again to warn them not to make noise, for fear of being overheard by bad people. Obviously, we weren't going home, but were sneaking around, preparing to do something adventurous.

　　Sure enough, late at night we arrived at the home of a stranger. The host and hostess, one with a dark, short, tightly curled hair plastered to the scalp. His wife was not as dark as him, with a thin, pointed nose and thin lips, looking like a half-Black person with Western European blood. There were already several Black men and women guests sitting in their hall. Adding the newly arrived bunch of white people, it was exactly a mixed Black and white gathering, and the police had the right to make arrests. Now I knew why we had been so cautious when we first came. According to that mayor of New Orleans, this was probably also evidence of American freedom.

　　This meeting was also arranged by Orga and her friends. Because the authorities of the University of Texas didn't agree to let Black people participate in the school party, they used this place to secretly hold a mixed Black and white progressive discussion meeting. Our host was called Mr. Carlton. He was a pastor in a Black church. He was a man of considerable reputation in the area. Especially among Black people, everyone regarded him as someone who knew everything. There were originally very few intellectuals among Black people. His wife said that she was a graduate of a famous Black university in Tennessee, but now she had nothing to do. The other Black people were also quite prominent in Black society, such as doctors, teachers, and so on. Orga carefully and considerately asked each of them for their opinions. Almost every sentence she said was meant to belittle the local white people, trying her best to make her opponents forget her pitiful colorless skin and treat her as one of their own. Then they were willing to speak their minds.

　　Orga's method succeeded. Those Black people—the elite of Austin's Black society—one by one poured out their hearts, turning the entire night into a complaint session. At first, everyone was just reporting what they had seen and heard, but later they also told their own heartbreaking stories. Someone told how he was slapped in the face by a white man on the street because he forgot to call the white man "Sir." Someone told how he was driven out of a large restaurant in the North because he was a Black person. Some said that because he wanted to earn a "Mr." title before his name, he was willing to send two hundred silver dollars to a white swindler to let him call him Mr. ××.

　　"Listening to that white pig call me Mr., my bones wanted to laugh." After the doctor finished his story, he shook his head despairingly and said: "It's really terrible to be insulted, those white pigs must want us to remember that we are slaves! We are crushed to death by them like this. What hope is there? When will this kind of life ever end!"

　　"That bastard mayor of New Orleans, he even said that doing this is because you can freely choose your own lifestyle," I said.

　　Our host, the pastor, suddenly jumped in his chair, gnashing his teeth, almost shouting: "'Free choice?' What way can we go, what can we choose? My wife wanted to go to Chicago a few days ago, but she couldn't. The station wouldn't write that she was Mrs. Carlton on her documents. They said: What Mrs. are Black slaves called? That's what they said. I'm a pastor, and I also have a doctorate. At the very least, my ancestors were slaves, but I am a free man, and I am a person of status, but my wife can't even have a title!?"

　　"Forget it," a young woman who was a teacher said, "what's the point of arguing about this? Just like today, the university held a party, and they said they would invite us. It's not that we wanted to go ourselves, and we didn't want to go at all. But, in the end, did they invite us?!" After she finished speaking, she kept sneering. Orga listened restlessly, wanting to defend herself but feeling it was inappropriate. In fact, these Black people all knew the reason why they couldn't go to the school party. Several white students who came with us apologized to the young Black teacher. The pastor also came out to smooth things over, explaining that it was sabotaged by the university's current authorities.

　　But the female teacher seemed to get angrier the more she listened. Her brown-black cheeks flushed, she stood up and said loudly: "I didn't deliberately wrong anyone. I know that white progressives are against oppressing us. But, how do they oppose it? And what if they don't oppose it? Aren't they all secretly following the reactionaries? I say, they simply look down on us. All white people are like this. They hate us. We are sad and depressed, we look down on ourselves, we ruin ourselves. We have become America's boil, and we are dragging them down. They hate us. They say nice things to us, but they cover their consciences and secretly follow the reactionaries. I hate them! I hate all the white ghosts, and I hate these progressives even more! In my opinion, we can't hope for anything from white people. We have no hope at all!..." Saying this, the young female teacher suddenly gasped like a steam engine venting air, and burst into loud sobs.

　　The entire room was shaken by this desperate, indignant outburst. Some people lowered their heads and wiped their tears, some people raised their eyes and stared straight at the female teacher, showing both bewilderment and anger. The pastor and his wife went to the female teacher, almost hugging her, patting her on the shoulder, wanting to help her go to rest. Orga's face was pale, and on her sharp, small eyes, the chestnut-yellow eyelashes were trembling rapidly. On this trip, what she was most worried about and afraid of was this deeply rooted attitude of suspicion and hostility towards white people among Black people. Here, it was not just that white people discriminated against Black people, but that Black people also deeply discriminated against white people. This attitude often creates many difficult-to-overcome obstacles to anti-discrimination work, which are even more troublesome than the open obstruction of the reactionaries. Especially today, this outburst was at a mixed Black and white meeting. The young white students present had never been subjected to such abuse. What would their reaction be? Orga lowered her head and rubbed her hands together forcefully. Fine beads of sweat appeared on the nervous little yellow spots on her face.

　　The whole room was suffocatingly tense. The female teacher's sobbing couldn't stop for a long time.

　　"What to do! I'm afraid only revolution is the way!" someone cried out painfully.

　　Orga seemed to suddenly get inspiration from this sentence. She stood up, looked at the female teacher, and said with the greatest effort, supporting a generous, steady attitude:

　　"Miss ×, I'm very sorry to have made you so upset. It's completely good that you brought up this issue today. It should be said so frankly. Otherwise, we would just be falling into the trap of the reactionaries. The reactionaries are trying to make us—the oppressed of both Black and white races—hate each other, resent each other. They deliberately turn class issues into racial issues, splitting the oppressed class. If we are not united, we cannot bring about any major changes in America—let alone talk about revolution. Now, good, we have said it, we must spit out the poison that the reactionaries made us eat. In this way, we can unite more closely and tightly to fight for our goals. Friends, under a system of people oppressing people, we the oppressed, Black people, white people, have no way out. Now every road is blocked by Wall Street. The rulers of Wall Street want our labor, want our lives. Let us stand together hand in hand and fight back against them!"

　　"That's right, they just want us to hate and resent each other. But it's good to say it out." Several voices said at the same time. The atmosphere in the room suddenly relaxed. Everyone started talking to each other in whispers. A Black lady sitting next to Orga tugged at Orga and whispered in her ear:

　　"If we had all been of one mind a long time ago, the reactionaries would have collapsed a long time ago. We still have to do this now! Let us recognize the boundaries, who is the enemy, who is the friend, and unite regardless of skin color!"

### 在美国南方

专栏：

　　在美国南方
    某年春天，我和一位美国朋友到美国南部去旅行。我们的目的是穿过极南各省到加里福尼亚去。据说春季走这条路是最好的，这时南部还不是热得不能忍受，可是热带蓊郁繁飞的气氛已经是满鼻满眼。等到夏天来了，南方太热时我们会已经离开它而到金光明亮的加里福尼亚去了。
    我的朋友原是北欧种，头发浅栗色，白皮肤上有些神经兮兮的小黄斑点，眼睛尖而小，也是栗色，闪动得很快，使人以为她精明能干，有时也好象是不够稳重。虽然如此，她行动说话却素常显出满有经验，不容易惊动的样子。她的名字叫俄加。我们约在一起旅行，是为了几个南方演讲会的原因。俄加是属于一种反对民族歧视的团体的人。所以在这些讲演会里她有一份。
    我承认我对美国南方早已有了一种成见，因为那个地方以歧视黑人出名。记得在赴美途中，船上一个茶房（记者应原谅我不说出他的皮肤颜色吧。你想，在美国船上侍候中国籍客人的茶房，哪有不是黑皮肤的呢？黄皮肤人除了极端特殊情形，是不可能在美国机关找到职务的。）对我说，他根本不觉得他是美国人。在纽约，那个把自由神像供在头顶上的所谓自由城，我也曾多次听到讲起哈尔列姆，那是白人不肯走近的区域，好象是纽约市中的大麻疯区一样。究其实，那地方不过是被白人财主们强迫制造的黑人居住地带而已。事实上，黑人问题好象是美国的代名词，又好象是长在美国鼻子上的大脓包，远远在海上就能看见，而且也闻得见它的臭味。因此，对于南方这样一个脓包区域，我算是有了充分准备，不打算到那里去找神仙世界的。
    即使是这样吧，过了华盛顿在火车上我已经就有一种进了生番世界的感觉。车厢还是很漂亮。白皮人们还是把脖子钮扣扣得整整齐齐的，下巴剃得和红色柿子一样，由穿白褂子的黑皮肤人们来侍奉着。饭厅里还是闪闪亮亮的银器和瓷器，盘子里用文明方法做成的鸡子，黄松松的，旁边还要配一棵碧绿的香菜。整个车厢里到处都好象是照得见人那么的干净漂亮，够得上标准的西方文明了。可是就在这个文明世界里，我得到一种不可告人的生番世界的感觉。我们的车厢里原来有两个黑色客人的，现在他们忽然不见了。也许是到站下车了吧。餐车里现在是一个黑人也没有了。在餐车的一头深深垂着厚呢绒幕，把那一小段地方紧紧掩盖着，好象里面藏了什么不能见人的东西。偶而帘幕起处一个光头穿白褂子的黑茶房高高托着一大盘菜肴钻了出来。就在这一刹那，我瞥见里面黑＠越＠越的尽是黑面孔黑头颅挤挤攒攒的在那里蠕动，好象在草莽森林中所见的情形一样。但这只是极短的一刹那，马上帘幕又封严了。整个餐厅依然雪亮，依然是雪亮的白色人们在悠然聊天。
    这种情形使我非常惊异。大概我是停止了吃喝，盯眼望着那古怪的帘幕，因为俄加把我撞了一下，用一种厌恶的声口说：
    “看什么？那里面是黑人在吃饭。他们就是这样受歧视的！”她反着叉子叉了一块鸡到嘴里去，继续很世故的提醒我：不要老瞪那呢绒帘子，否则里面被歧视了的黑人发现了是会生气的。
    饭后，由于好奇心的驱使，我决心穿走整个火车，看看这种歧视的究竟。老实讲，我虽生在一个多民族的中国，却还没有看到过这种一民族命令另一民族整个做下等人类的事。这好象是野蛮时代的行为，与眼前晶晶亮亮的所谓西方文明绝不相称。我不和俄加讲，就去开始我的探险旅行。我想看看黑人车，尤其是想找到那和我们曾经同过车厢的两位黑人。其中那女的眼睛很大，很富表情，我以为是美丽的。
    火车过了华盛顿之后，南去的客人似乎少了些，车辆显得很空。我一口气走了七八辆车，人都不多，而且没有一个黑色皮肤的人。我有些灰心，打算回头时，才忽然找到一个车厢是隔成了两半的。一半较长，都是白人；另半较短，都是黑人。这黑色的半节车显得又暗又脏，可能是因为车身太旧，光线太少，而且糟杂拥挤的原故。很快我发现从这半节车厢里四面八方都是白瞪眼向我集中。而在这冷森森的白眼的包围之中，我看到一对恶狠狠的大眼象两片刀锋直指着我。我感到恐怖，赶紧回头就走。甚至那个曾经和我同了车的黑种女人也用那样狠毒的眼光来看我。
    回到自己车厢里，我不把我的经验告诉俄加，尽自己望着窗外生气。俄加神经兮兮的把我看了半天，好象不明白我是为了什么，也不言语。
    愈向南走，这种不容易消化的经历愈多。因为是和一个白种人在一起，我觉得自己好象永远在对黑人打埋伏，有他的地方没有我，有我的地方没有他。甚至连街道都分了黑白。至于饭馆、酒店、候车室、毛房、电车、汽车——白人司机不替黑人开车，不进黑人区域——所有一切人和人有关的东西都分成了黑白两个世界，黑白一碰头，就是白刀子进，红刀子出。惟一的例外恐怕就是白人强奸黑女这种事情了。这个外面晶光雪亮的美国文明肚子里藏着一种恐龙时代的可怕的混战。
    起初我还时常向俄加提出这事来谈论。但她总是做出不愿意多说的样子。回答简单而干脆：
    “因为它是这样，所以要斗争，要把它消除哪？”她不愿鼓励我说，她害怕我在遇到黑色进步人士的场合，随便发表意见刺伤了他们。那样她的工作就会更难做一些。有一次，要到黑人区去赴一个讲演会。仅仅半点钟路程，但一个钟头以前，她就强迫我出发，说宁可我们去等候听讲的人，否则黑人会说她摆白人架子。
    可是那个在纽俄连斯做父母官的市长却绝不肯承认这种事实。他用一种先知先觉的态度启示我说：
    “不要相信那些北方佬讲的话。他们不在南方怎么晓得我们的事情？他们也不懂黑人。黑人真心不愿和白人混在一起。不是吗？我们美国是自由的。各人都要自由的按自己的自由方式生活。黑人喜欢南方，喜欢跟他们自己同种人在一起。不是什么人歧视他们，是他们自己要从我们分开。要晓得我们美国是最自由的国家呀！”
    这个骗子冤枉了许多“北方佬”。他们的这一套，北方佬除了进步分子以外，是会说也会做的。所以我听了并不觉得陌生，也不需对他作什么答复。黑人自己已经是整天在事实上答复他了。
    我们到了德格萨斯州。这是全美最大的一州。它的人民据说是以强悍骄傲著名。同时这个州据说是南部最开明的。州立德格萨斯大学在它的首府奥斯丁。这大学曾经在过一个为了拥护罗斯福政策而丢了饭碗的校长。我们到时，那校长刚刚被董事会赶走。但他的学生们却舍不得他。因此，借着我们到来的机会，学生们组织了一个晚会一面欢送他，一面欢迎我们。
    事先，我曾经听到俄加和学生们商量，要请几个黑人青年团体的代表来参加这个会。这是犯法的。若被警察发现了就要坐牢。俄加他们却想倚赖这家大学的进步空气和德格萨斯州据说是比较开明的声誉来做这样一件破天荒的事情，向反动统治者的法律作一个突击。
    那天晚上情形真是很热闹。学生们还预备了军乐队，中美国旗，军乐奏了两国国歌，中国国歌是用“义勇军进行曲”代替的。那校长演了讲，许多人都讲了话，喝了歌，做了戏。可是单单就是黑人的节目没有。并且根本就没有一个黑人代表到来。我不知别人的感觉怎样，自己是好象在五里雾中，沉沉闷闷一直坐到晚会终结。
    会散了之后，俄加立刻拖着我冲破了包围着要签字的人群，钻进了一个朋友车里，催着开车。似乎要逃难，否则就是要奔赴什么秘密使命的样子。问她，她只在我耳朵里嘘了一句，根本没听见讲的是什么。车老不开。主人似乎在车外面指挥什么行动。逐渐的我们这辆小车里挤上了四五个人。他们唧唧咕咕压低了声音在讲着要到什么地方去，同时也嘻嘻哈哈很兴奋的催着车子快点走，怕去的太晚了。这时候，车主又来警戒他们不要嚷，怕让坏人听见。显然的，我们不是回家去，而是在偷偷摸摸，准备做什么冒险事情。
    果然，我们在深夜到了一个不相识者的家里。主人夫妇，一个是面孔黧黑，短而虬纠的黑发紧紧巴在头皮上。他的太太没有他那么黑，细尖鼻子薄嘴唇，看来象是有西欧血液的半黑人。他们的大厅里已经有了好几个黑色男女客人在座了。加上新去的一堆白种人，恰恰是一个黑白混合的集会，警察有权利来执行拘捕的。现在我才知道先头来时为什么要那样警戒了。依纽俄连斯那个市长看来，这大概也是美国自由的明证吧。
    这个会还是俄加和她的朋友们安排的。因为德格萨斯大学当局不答应让黑人参加学校晚会，所以他们借了这个地方来偷偷举行一个黑白进步分子混合谈话会。我们的主人叫做卡尔吞先生。他是一家黑人教堂里的牧师。在当地是一个有相当名望的人。特别是在黑人中，大家都把他当做无所不知，无所不晓的人看待。黑人中的知识分子本来是很少的呵。他的太太说是田尼亚省一家有名黑人大学毕业的高材生，但是现在却没有事做。其余几个黑种人也都是黑种社会里相当有地位的如医生教师等等。俄加小心而体贴的向他们每个人请教了一番。她几乎每一句话都要把当地白人鄙薄一下，尽力使她的对手忘掉她那可怜的无色的皮肤，把她当自己人看待。然后他们才肯讲出心里的话来。
    俄加的方法成功了。那些黑人们——奥斯丁城黑籍社会的精华——一个个先后倾怀吐臆，把整个夜里变成了诉苦会。起初大家还只是报告见闻，后来就把自己的伤心事也讲出来。有人说出他怎样在马路上挨白人嘴巴，因为他在说话之中，忘记了称那白人是“Ｓｉｒ”，“先生”。有人讲他在北方怎样被大饭馆赶出门外，因为他是黑皮的人。有的则说出他因为要在他的名字上面争得一个“先生”ｍｉｓｔｅｒ的称号，他宁愿送二百元大洋给一个白种骗子，让他喊自己一声××先生。
    “听那个白猪叫我一声先生，我的骨头都要笑了。”那个医生讲完了自己的故事之后，又摇着头绝望的说：“受侮辱真是可怕呀，那些白猪一定要我们记住自己是奴才！我们就这样被他压死了。有什么希望呢？几时才过得完这种日子哩！”
    “那个混蛋的纽俄连斯市长，他还说这样做是因为你们能够自由选择你们自己的生活方式呢。”我说。
    我们的主人那个牧师忽然在椅上跳了一下，切齿的，几乎是叫起来的说：“‘自由选择？’我们有什么路可走，有什么可选呀？我的老婆前几天要去支加哥，就去不成。车站里不肯在她的文件上写出她是卡尔吞太太Ｍｒｓ　Ｃａｒｌｔｏｎ。他们说：黑奴叫什么太太？他们就是这样讲的呀。我是牧师，我也拿了博士学位。至不济，我的祖宗当了奴才，我可是自由的人，而且是有地位的人，我的老婆就连一个称呼都不能有哇！？”
    “算了，”一个做教员的年青女人说，“这有什么理可讲？就象今天大学开晚会，他们说要请我们去。又不是我们自己要去，而且我们根本就不要去呢。可是，到后来，他们究竟请了我们没有！？”她说完一直冷笑。俄加坐立不安的听着，想有所申辩而又觉得不适当的样子。其实这几个黑人全知道他们不能去学校开会的原因。几个同来的白种学生抱歉的向那年青黑教员解释。那个牧师也出来转圜，说明那是大学现在的当局破坏的。
    可是女教员好象越听越有气了。她的棕黑脸颊里泛红，她站起来大声说：“我没有故意冤枉人。我晓得白种的进步人士是反对压迫我们。可是，他们反对怎样？不反对又怎样？他们不都是暗跟着反动派在走吗？我说，他们根本就看我们不起。所有的白人都是这样。他们恨我们。我们忧苦气闷，看不起自己，糟踏自己。我们变成了美国的脓包，连累了他们。他们恨我们。他们嘴上对我们讲好话，可是他们掩盖着良心暗暗跟反动派走。我恨他们！我恨所有的白鬼，我更恨这些进步人士！依我说，我们就不能从白人希望什么。我们什么希望都没有！……”说到这里，年青的女教员忽然象蒸汽炉冒气，“扑”的一声，大声抽气痛哭起来。
    整个房间都被这种绝望的，悲愤的爆发冲激着。有人低头拭眼泪，有人竖起眼睛直瞪着女教员，显出又惶惑又气恼的样子。牧师和他的太太走到女教员跟前去，几乎是拥抱着她的拍她的肩膀，想要扶她去休息。俄加满脸苍白，尖而小的眼睛上，栗黄色睫毛在疾速的颤抖。在这趟路上，她所最担心最害怕的就是在黑人当中这种根深蒂固的对白人疑惧仇视的态度。在这里，已经不仅仅是白人歧视黑人，而是黑人也深刻的歧视白人。这种态度时常对反歧视工作发生很多不容易克服的阻碍，比反动派公开的阻挠还要麻烦。尤其是今天这种爆发是在黑白混合会上。在座的白种年青学生们都是从来没有受过这样谩骂的。他们的反应会怎样呢？俄加低着头，把两只手掌相互用力摩擦。从她脸上那些神经质的小黄斑点浮起细细的汗珠。
    整个屋子是窒息的紧张着。女教员的抽噎老不能停止。
    “怎么好呵！恐怕只有革命才是路哩！”不知是谁这样痛苦的呼起来。
    俄加好象忽然从这句话得到了启示。她站起来对着那女教员望了一望，用最大的努力支持着一种大方的，稳定的态度说：
    “×小姐，非常的对不住你，使你这样难受。你今天把这个问题提出来完全是好的。是应该这样坦白的说出来。要不然，就正好中了反动派的诡计了。反动派正想法使我们——黑白两族的受压迫者——彼此仇视，彼此怨恨。他们故意把阶级问题说成是种族问题，把受压迫阶级分裂。我们不团结我们就不能够在美国引起什么重大改变——更不要讲革命的话了。现在，好了，我们讲出来，就是反动派让我们吃的毒药我们要把它吐出来。这样，我们就好更紧更密的团结为我们的目标斗争。朋友们，在人压迫人的制度下面，我们受压迫者，黑人，白人，都是没有出路的。现在是条条道路都被华尔街阻断了。华尔街的统治者要我们的劳力，要我们的命。让我们手牵着手站在一起，向他们反攻！”
    “对啊，他们就巴不得我们彼此仇视怨恨。不过，说出来是好的。”好几个声音同时这样说着。屋子里一下就松畅了。大家交头接耳谈起话来。坐在俄加旁边一个黑色太太把俄加一扯，用嘴附在她耳边透露秘密的小声说：
    “假如我们老早大家一齐心，反动派也老早就垮台了。我们现在还是要这样做！让我们认清界线，谁是敌人，谁是朋友，不分肤色团结起来吧！”
