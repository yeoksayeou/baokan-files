　　New Direction of Sports
    Feng Wenbin, Secretary of the Central Committee of the New Democratic Youth League
    [Beijing News] Feng Wenbin, Secretary of the Central Committee of the New Democratic Youth League of China, gave a speech at the reception held by the Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Democratic Youth Federation for the sports circles on August 28. The fourth part of his speech, "New Direction of Sports," is recorded as follows:

    Sports are very important. Revolutionary sports can promote physical health, cultivate strong and brave qualities and the determination to overcome difficulties and strive for victory, and inspire human wisdom and creativity. All of this is the capital of revolution and an important condition for engaging in New Democratic industrial construction and various undertakings. Moreover, we will build the national defense forces of the New Democratic country in the future—new-style army, navy, air force, motorized units, and other national defense construction undertakings, which also require physically fit, brave, and resourceful young people to shoulder this sacred responsibility. In short, sports are of great significance for training the younger generation to become builders and defenders of the New Democratic country.

    Chinese sports have made progress and achievements in the past three decades. However, there are still shortcomings and errors: First, it is a sport for a few people, even a few experts, not a mass sport for the people. Moreover, sports are regarded as social ornaments, only for the enjoyment of a few, divorced from the actual needs of the masses, and sports for the sake of sports. Furthermore, there is a mentality of championism in the sports world, with friction and struggle among themselves, selfishness, and individualism. Often, in order to win the competition and win the championship, they do not hesitate to deliberately violate the rules and even harm the opponent's body.

    These shortcomings and errors are the result of the Kuomintang reactionaries' restriction, sabotage, and instigation. They are unwilling to popularize sports, unwilling to have people with sound physiques, and unwilling to have sports serve progressive causes. For example, three years ago when I came to Shanghai, Ms. Soong Ching Ling intended to invite Mr. Li Huitang of the Hong Kong football team to hold a charity football match to raise funds for children's welfare, but it was prevented by the Kuomintang reactionaries.

    What should be the direction of sports in the future? I would like to put forward a few suggestions for your reference and study.

    First, the purpose of sports should be to cultivate the people and the entire young generation of the New Democratic country to become healthy, happy, strong, and resourceful people who can strive to build an independent, free, democratic, and prosperous New China and strengthen the power of the New Democratic motherland to defeat all internal and external enemies.

    Therefore, the content of the new sports movement must be revolutionary, establish the spirit of serving the people, and be closely integrated with the New Democratic construction cause. It must be scientific, not backward; it must be mass-oriented, collectivist, not for a few people, individual heroism. At the same time, we must launch a popular sports movement, not stay with a few intellectuals, but promote it universally, from schools to factories, from cities to the countryside, from educated youth to the working masses, to all the people. And we must adopt various forms to carry out sports activities, not only high jump, running, playing ball, etc., but also knife fighting, bayonet practice, parachute jumping, and Tai Chi, should all become forms of sports activities, so as to achieve popularization. In addition, we should also establish new sports ethics and styles. The basic spirit is to be loyal to the New Democratic country, loyal to the working people, to serve the people, and to engage in sports activities on the basis of new patriotism. Second, we must oppose individualistic thinking, actions that harm others to gain "victory," and oppose the conservative style of holding back. Any new creations and experiences we have in sports should be quickly disseminated, exchanged, and learned from each other to further develop sports. Third, we must advocate a simple and practical style, not pursue formal extravagance. To carry out sports activities, it is not necessary to have gorgeous uniforms, elaborate venues, and complex equipment. Like our People's Liberation Army, wherever they are stationed, they build a sports field, so that sports can be popularized. Finally, we must also have a spirit of humbly learning and constantly striving for progress.

    Finally, let's talk about the organization and leadership of sports. Our New Democratic Youth League is prepared to fully cooperate with the People's Government and all sports organizations in the country to unite and launch a popular, widespread, and universal New Democratic sports movement under the leadership of the Communist Party. Today, because the war is not yet over and there are many things to be done urgently, and we have only just begun to contact friends in the sports world, we hope that after the war is completely won, we can convene a national sports conference in Beijing or elsewhere, and under the general goal of building a New Democracy, promote and carry forward the new sports movement throughout the country.

### 体育的新方向

　　体育的新方向
    新民主主义青年团中央委员会书记冯文彬
    【北京讯】中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会书记冯文彬于八月二十八日在上海市民主青年联合会筹委会举行的招待体育界的大会上讲演，兹志其讲演词第四部分“体育的新方向”如下：
    体育是很重要的。革命的体育运动，它能促进身体健康，还能培养人们具有坚强勇敢的品质和克服困难争取胜利的决心，并启发人的智慧和创造性。这一切，都是革命的资本，又是从事新民主主义的工业建设与各种事业的重要条件，而且我们今后要建设新民主主义国家的国防军——新式的陆军、海军、空军、摩托化部队、以及其他各种国防建设事业，也需要体格健全勇敢机智的青年人来担负起这个神圣的责任。总之，体育对于训练年青一代成为新民主主义国家的建设者和保卫者，是具有重大意义的。
    中国体育运动，在近三十年来是有进展的，有成绩的。但还存在着缺点和错误的：首先，是少数人的甚至几个专家的运动，不是人民大众的体育运动；并且把体育当作社会的点缀品，仅仅为了供少数人的玩赏，脱离群众的实际需要，为体育而体育；还有，体育界中存在着锦标主义的思想，相互间闹磨擦斗争，自私自利，个人主义，往往为了自己想在比赛中获取胜利夺得锦标，不惜故意违犯规则，甚至伤害对方的身体。
    这些缺点和错误，是国民党反动派限制、破坏、挑拨的结果，他们不愿意体育普及，不愿意人民都有健全的体格，不愿意体育为进步的事业服务，如三年前我来上海时，宋庆龄女士拟请香港足球队的李惠堂先生为筹募儿童福利基金举行一次足球义赛，就被国民党反动派阻止了。
    今后体育的方向应该怎样呢？我提出几点意见来，供各位参考，请大家研究、指教。
    首先，体育运动的目的，应该是为了培养新民主主义国家的人民和整个青年一代，成为健康、愉快、坚强、机智的人，能够为建设独立、自由、民主、富强的新中国而奋斗，并能加强新民主主义祖国的威力，战胜一切内外的敌人。
    因此，新体育运动的内容必须是革命的，要确立为人民服务的精神，要与新民主主义建设事业密切结合起来。必须是科学的，而不是落后的；必须是大众化的，集体主义的，而不是少数人的，个人英雄主义的。同时，必须展开普及的体育运动，不要停留在少数知识分子身上，要普遍地推广开去，要从学校到工厂，从城市到乡村，从知识青年到劳动群众，到一切人民中去。并且必须采取各种各样的形式去开展体育运动，不仅是跳高、赛跑、打球等等，就是劈刀、刺枪、跳降落伞、打太极拳，都应成为体育活动的形式，这样才能做到普及。此外，我们还应该确立新的体育道德和作风。总的基本精神，也就是必须忠于新民主主义国家、忠于劳动人民，要为人民服务，在新爱国主义的基础上来从事体育运动。其次，要反对个人主义的思想，损害别人获得“胜利”的行为，反对保守的留一手的作风，我们任何人在体育运动方面有新的创造和经验，都应该迅速传布、交流，互相切磋、学习，使体育运动获得进一步的开展；第三，要提倡朴素切实的作风，不要追求形式的铺张，开展体育运动，不一定要有华贵的制服、考究的场地和复杂的设备，象我们的解放军，往往驻到哪里就在哪里建起一个运动场来，这样才能普及体育。最后，还必须要有虚心学习，不断求进的精神。
    末了，谈谈体育的组织和领导的问题。我们新民主主义青年团，准备以全力来配合人民政府，及全国一切体育组织与团结，开展一个共产党领导下的、人民大众的、广泛而普遍的、新民主主义的体育运动。今天因为战争还没有结束，急待进行的事情还很多，并且，和体育界的朋友还仅仅开始接触，我们希望：在战争完全胜利以后，能在北京或其他地方，召开一次全国性的运动大会，并在建设新民主主义的总目标下，把新体育运动在全国范围内推广开去，发扬光大。（附图片）
