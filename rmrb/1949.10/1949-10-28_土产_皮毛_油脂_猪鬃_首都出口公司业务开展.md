　　Native Produce, Fur, Oils and Fats, Bristles
    Business Development of the Capital Export Company
    Jin Yu
    The four specialized branches of the company, responsible for managing the export trade of native produce, fur, oils and fats, and bristles, were officially established in early October, according to the specific situation in Beijing, and have begun business activities, achieving initial success in procurement.
    Native Produce Branch
    The Beijing Branch of the North China Native Produce Company officially began operations on October 1st. The Yixian County Branch and the Zhangfangzhen (under Fangshan County) team have been established one after another, and personnel have been sent to prepare for the establishment of the Zhaizhang and Huairou teams. The company's directly affiliated purchasing department (in Beijing City) and the established branches and teams have all started purchasing work. The Yixian County Branch has purchased 100,000 jin of medicinal materials, the Zhangfang team has collected about 30,000 jin of mountain goods, and the directly affiliated purchasing department can collect around 20,000 jin of mountain goods daily.
    The company's operating area is very broad. According to regulations, it includes sixteen counties such as Miyun, Huairou, Shunyi, Changping, Tongxian, Pinggu, Sanhe, Wanping, Zhuoxian, Liangxiang, Fangshan, Laishui, Yixian, Sihai, Zhuolu, and Laiyuan. The scope of operations currently focuses on mountain goods and medicinal materials, followed by cellophane noodles. In the future, it will increase the operation of mineral products such as asbestos and black alum, according to the needs of the international market.
    In order to connect with mass production, the main operating method of the native produce business is to combine with local cooperatives. The business relationship with cooperatives adopts the method of "cash on delivery" or "commission for agency purchase." In order to facilitate farmers to exchange agricultural products for necessary goods, it also pilots the "establishment of joint contracts for in-kind exchange." The method is: cooperatives that have mountain goods or medicinal materials and also need goods operated by a certain specialized company to supply to local farmers can first sign a contract with the specialized company to obtain the goods to exchange for native produce from the farmers, which are then summarized and handed over to the native produce company. The cooperative's debt to the specialized company can be directly paid by the native produce company. This is a new method, which is of great benefit to the purchase of native produce and the supply of necessities to farmers.
    Fur Branch
    The Beijing Branch of the North China Fur Company is one of the main export companies, and its business is to purchase hides, furs, casings, and locally produced carpets collected from various places in Beijing. According to the flow of hides and furs, its procurement area should be from eastern Jidong, north to Chengde and Chifeng, south to the mountainous areas west of Baoding, and west to the area east of Zhangjiakou. However, the focus of procurement is currently in the suburbs of Beijing.
    Although the fur branch has four businesses, it mainly focuses on the operation of hides and furs at present. The quantity of carpets and casings purchased is very small. The former uses a commissioned processing method, and the latter purchases semi-finished products.
    In early October, the company already had nearly 200,000 jin of wool (more than 30,000 jin purchased in early October, and more than 160,000 jin of fleece transferred from the former trading company) and more than 30,000 sheepskins (22,700 goatskins, and more than 10,000 sheepskins), which were successively sent to Tianjin.
    Oils and Fats Branch
    The Beijing Branch of the Oils and Fats Company has one branch company and four teams under its jurisdiction. The branch company is located in Baoding, and the four teams are located in Huairou, Zhuoxian, Daxing, and Tongxian. The business area of the branch company includes: Zhuoxian, Liangxiang, Fangshan, Daxing, Tongxian, Sanhe, Jixian, Pinggu, Shunyi, Huairou, Miyun, Changping, Baxian, Xianghe, Yongqing, and Guan sixteen counties. In addition, the Baoding branch company operates in fourteen counties including Dingxing and Xushui, totaling thirty counties.
    The North China Oils and Fats Company, according to the general policy of developing industrial and agricultural production and establishing independent foreign trade, organizes the export of vegetable oil and oilseeds to earn foreign exchange and exchange for the necessary amount of petroleum and imported raw materials for industrial use. Under this principle, the Beijing Branch and its subordinate branch companies and teams specifically implement the task of promoting petroleum and purchasing vegetable oil and oilseeds. The purchasing method is through exchanges with cooperatives and farmers. In order to encourage farmers to grow more cash crops, appropriately control the prices of oilseeds so that the profits of cash crops such as peanuts are higher than those of general crops.
    Because the season for oilseed marketing has not yet arrived, the purchasing work is in the preparation stage. According to its负责人, "Based on the spirit of developing urban industry and the general company's business policy, with the export of oils and fats as the main focus, they will vigorously support and develop the Beijing Vegetable Oil Factory, expand its output, purchase its finished oil at reasonable prices, or supply oilseeds at appropriate profits, and entrust it to process." This will enable the Beijing oil pressing industry to prosper and develop.
    Bristles Branch
    The North China Bristles Company officially started operations in Tianjin on October 15th, and the Beijing Branch also launched business operations in mid-October.
    According to the historical pattern of bristle circulation, Beijing has become one of the main distribution centers for bristles. A considerable amount of bristles from Suiyuan, Zhangjiakou, Quyang and Tangxian in central Hebei, and the Beiyue area, and even Xi'an, are gathered here. The quantity of goods arriving is greater from Suiyuan and Zhangjiakou. Due to the gradual restoration of transportation, goods have also arrived from Xi'an in recent days. According to rough estimates, during the peak season (from the first to the fourth month of the lunar calendar), the Beijing market can receive around 10,000 jin of goods per month.
    The task of the Beijing Branch is to purchase the bristles gathered here. In early October, it successively purchased more than 7,000 jin of raw bristles and more than 1,360 jin of processed bristles, achieving initial success in purchasing operations.
    There are two purchasing methods: one is to purchase from the 客市 of Beijing bristle warehouses, and the other is to 代收代购 through the farmer接待所 established by the Supply and Marketing Cooperative. In order to reduce the cost of export goods, the company will begin direct purchases in Xijiaominxiang as soon as the business personnel are fully equipped.

　　土产　皮毛　油脂　猪鬃　
    首都出口公司业务开展
    靳羽
    肩负着经营出口贸易的土产、皮毛、油脂、猪鬃四个专业分支公司，根据北京具体情况，先后于十月初正式成立起来，并展开业务活动，在收购上并已获得初步成绩。
    土产分公司
    华北土产公司北京分公司，十月一日正式开始营业，所属易县支公司及张房镇（房山县属）小组已先后成立，斋堂和怀柔两个小组也已派人前往筹组。该公司的直属收购部（在北京市内）和已成立之支公司、小组，收购工作都已开始。易县支公司已收购药材十万斤，张房小组已收了山货约三万斤，直属收购部每日即能收进山货二万斤上下。
    该公司的经营区域很广，根据规定，有密云、怀柔、顺义、昌平、通县、平谷、三河、宛平、涿县、良乡、房山、涞水、易县、四海、涿鹿、涞源等十六个县。经营的范围目前以山货、药材为主，其次是粉丝。今后将依国际市场需要增营石绵、黑矾等矿产。
    为了联系群众生产，土产业务经营方式主要是结合各地合作社，与合作社的业务关系，采用“现款现货”或“代购抽手续费”方式进行收购；为便利农民以农产品换回必需物品，并试行“成立联合合同，进行实物交换”。其办法是：拥有山货或药材之合作社，同时需要某专业公司经营之货品供应当地农民，该合作社即可先向专业公司订定合同，以取得之货品向农民换取土产，汇总交给土产公司，合作社欠专业公司之货款，可由土产公司直接拨付。这是一种新的方式，通过这种方式对土产的收购，和对农民必需品的供应，都有很大裨益。
    皮毛分公司
    华北皮毛公司北京分公司，是主要出口公司之一，业务是收购各地汇集到北京的皮、毛、肠衣和当地出产的地毯。按照皮、毛流转规律，其收购区域应是东至冀东一带，北至承德、赤峰，南至保定以西山地，西至张家口以东地区。但目前收购之重心则在北京市郊。
    皮毛分公司的业务虽有四项，但在目前是以经营皮、毛为主。地毯和肠衣收购的数量很小，前者是采用委托加工的方式，后者收买半成品。
    该公司在十月上旬已有近二十万斤的羊毛（十月上旬收购的三万余斤，接收前贸易公司移交套毛十六万余斤）和三万余张羊皮（山羊板皮二万二千七百张，绵羊皮一万余张），陆续送到天津。
    油脂分公司
    油脂公司北京分公司下属一个支公司和四个小组，支公司设在保定，四个小组分置在怀柔、涿县、大兴、通县。分公司的业务区域有：涿县、良乡、房山、大兴、通县、三河、蓟县、平谷、顺义、怀柔、密云、昌平、霸县、香河、永清、固安等十六个县。再加上保定支公司经营区域定兴、徐水等十四县，共有三十个县。
    华北油脂公司根据发展工农业生产，建立独立自主的对外贸易的总方针，组织植物油及油料输出，争取外汇，换回必需数量的石油及配合工业原料的进口。北京分公司及所属支公司及小组在这个原则下，具体执行推销石油，收购植物油及油料的任务。收购方式是通过合作社和农民进行交换，为了鼓励农民多种经济作物，适当的掌握油料价格，使花生仁等经济作物利润高于一般农作物的利润。
    由于油料上市季节尚未到来，所以收购工作正在准备阶段，据其负责人谈：“根据发展城市工业及总公司业务方针，以出口油脂为主的精神，他们将大力扶植与发展京市植物油厂，扩大其产量，以合理价格定购其成油，或给以适当的利润供给油料，委托其加工。”这将使京市榨油业获得繁荣与发展。
    猪鬃支公司
    华北猪鬃公司十月十五日在天津正式开始营业，北京支公司亦在本月中旬展开业务经营。
    根据历来猪鬃流转的规律，北京无形中成了猪鬃主要集散地之一。绥远、张家口、冀中的曲阳、唐县及北岳一带，甚至西安等地鬃毛，均有相当数量聚集到此。来货的数量以绥远、张家口较多。由于交通的渐次恢复，西安近日亦有来货。据约略统计，每逢上货的季节（农历正月至四月），北京市场上每月能上货万斤左右。
    北京支公司的任务是以收购聚集此间的鬃毛为主，十月上旬先后收进生鬃七千余斤，毛鬃一千三百六十余斤，在收购业务上获得初步成绩。
    收购的方式有两种，一种是向京市猪鬃货栈的客市收买，另一种是由供销合作总社所设立的农民招待所代收代购。该公司为了减低出口物资成本，俟业务人员配备齐全，即开始在西交民巷直接收购。
