Villages and Towns Along the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway Line Burst into Cheers
　　Celebrating Chairman Mao's Election
    [Zhangjiakou, 2nd Dispatch] Farmers in villages and towns along the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway line warmly support the establishment of the Central People's Government led by Chairman Mao. In Gaomiaobao Village, a suburb of Zhangjiakou City, every household has pasted bright red couplets at their doors with slogans like "Celebrating the Establishment of the Central People's Government" and "Supporting Chairman Mao." Farmers in Laoyazhuang Village erected a pine and willow evergreen archway at the village entrance, with a red plaque in the middle bearing five large characters: "Long Live Chairman Mao." The streets and alleys in the village were swept clean. The news of Chairman Mao's election as Chairman of the Central People's Government made the farmers particularly happy. Now that the autumn harvest is in full swing, Zhang Wanjin of Xiaozhan Village in the Zhangjiakou suburbs started talking about Chairman Mao from the autumn harvest, he said: "Chairman Mao leads us so well, just take the autumn plowing as an example. This year the village is preparing for a good harvest. In the past, there were few autumn plowing fields. This is all thanks to Chairman Mao's land reform methods that have motivated everyone. This spring, everyone was allocated two or three mu of land, so everyone has to be energetic. At the Yanggao County Representatives Conference, news of the opening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference came, and a farmer representative said in a coarse voice: "In the past, the knife handle was in the hands of the reactionaries, oppressing us so that we didn't dare to raise our heads. Now that we have the knife handle in our own hands, the world of us common people will become more and more consolidated!" His words were met with applause from the audience. The farmers of Xinbao'an in Huailai were even more excited. This year, Sun Xi, a newly emancipated farmer, was so happy after hearing the good news that he shouted to everyone he met: "Do you know? Our government is about to be established, and our lives will be even better in the future!"
