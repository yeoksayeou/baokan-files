The Ministry of Railways Engineering Conference, Day Three

Soviet Experts Introduce Road Maintenance Experience

Minister Teng Calls for Earnest Study

[Report from this newspaper] The Ministry of Railways' National Engineering Conference entered its third day yesterday (the 19th). Soviet experts gave special reports, Minister Teng Daiyuan attended and spoke, and in the afternoon, various bureaus held group discussions to extensively exchange opinions.

Soviet bridge expert, Gink Lienko, introduced the general situation of bridge repair and new construction work in the Soviet Union. He said: Before constructing each bridge in the Soviet Union, precise surveys and designs are conducted, the construction design standards are nationally uniform, and the construction budget also has clear regulations; on the principle of saving money, time, and labor, the quality of the buildings is improved. Due to the use of factory production methods and mechanized production methods, the Soviet bridge construction has achieved brilliant results. He said: China's bridge design lacks unified standards and mechanical equipment. When constructing bridges, not enough attention is paid to the construction work on both sides of the river and the riverbed. Water damage often occurs, which often damages the bridges. This is where China's bridge work urgently needs improvement. Bridge maintenance work has not been well developed either. Some bridges have been kept in their original condition since they were newly built and have never been supplemented. This is a very bad phenomenon.

Soviet line expert, Zakondaev, based on the Soviet road maintenance experience, believes that road maintenance workers should not simply focus on replacing steel rails and sleepers, etc., but should earnestly strengthen road maintenance work. The most important thing in road maintenance is to prevent rail creep, but this has not been paid attention to in China's railway maintenance. He said, "This cannot be ignored!" Based on his inspection results, he put forward eleven opinions on engineering work to the conference: (1) Strengthen anti-creep work, and factories and engineering sections should rush to manufacture anti-creep devices; (2) Roadbeds that do not meet the standards and lines should be replenished, especially the line from Zhengzhou to Hankou; (3) Replace bad sleepers and steel rails, and first pay attention to damaged areas; (4) Sift ballast that has not been sifted; (5) Organize engineering teams to repair bridges and culverts, and first repair damaged sections; (6) Supplement bridge personnel in each section, establish bridge deputy section chiefs, and if there are few bridges, have supervisors guard the bridges. The engineering section should also have bridge inspector positions; (7) Separate regular road repairs and large-scale repairs; (8) Stipulate the categories of engineering work as on-site standards; (9) Stipulate the quota of track patrolmen; (10) Work guidelines and technical management regulations should implement the maintenance of large buildings and road maintenance work; (11) When laying Soviet steel rails, line personnel should add shims, but without anti-creep devices, it is still not feasible. Next, Soviet expert, Guo Erqin, introduced the types, organization, and technical standards of Soviet road maintenance work. Soviet road maintenance expert, Sheroki, pointed out that road maintenance work should be regarded as regular work, not only to ensure driving safety, but also to rationally use materials, organize the distribution of labor, and reduce costs. Finally, Minister Teng Daiyuan, on behalf of the Ministry of Railways, expressed his gratitude to the Soviet experts and called on all railway workers to earnestly study Soviet experience, carefully discuss the speeches of the Soviet experts, deeply study the work reports of the past two days, overcome conservative ideas, and universally implement new road maintenance methods.

　　铁道部工务会议第三日
  　苏专家介绍养路经验
  　滕部长号召认真学习
    【本报讯】铁道部全国工务会议昨（十九）进入第三日。苏联专家作专题报告，滕代远部长出席讲话，下午各局分组讨论，广泛交换意见。
    苏联桥梁专家金克连果介绍苏联修复与新建桥梁工作的概况。他说：苏联每建筑桥梁前，都精密地查勘和设计，建筑设计标准是全国一致的，建筑预算亦有明确规定；在省钱、省时、省人工的原则下，提高建筑物的质量。由于运用工厂生产法和机械化生产法，苏联桥梁建筑获得辉煌的成绩。他说：中国桥梁设计没有统一标准，缺乏机械设备。在建筑桥梁时，没有很好注意河流两岸及河底的修建工作，水害发生，常损坏桥梁，这是中国桥梁工作亟需改进的地方。对于桥梁保养工作，也没很好的展开，有的桥梁新建以后，一直保持原有情况，从不加以补养，这是很不好的现象。
    苏联线路专家扎康达耶夫根据苏联养路经验，认为养路工作者不应单纯注重换钢轨、枕木等，应该切实地加强养路工作。养路工作最重要的是防止爬行，但在中国铁路养路方面没有注意起来。他说：“这是不能忽视的！”根据他视察的结果，向大会提出十一点有关工务工作的意见：（一）加强防爬工作，各工厂、工务段应赶制防爬器；（二）道床不够标准和线路，要补足，尤其是郑州到汉口的线路；（三）抽换不良道木和钢轨，首先要注意破坏的地区；（四）没有清筛道碴的，要清筛；（五）组织工程队补修桥梁和水洞，首先要补修破坏的区间；（六）各段补足桥梁人员，设桥梁副段长，桥梁少的地方监工员看守桥梁，工务段还要有桥梁巡视员的编制；（七）经常修路和大量补修要分开；（八）规定工务工作的类别，作为现场的标准；（九）规定巡道员定员；（十）工作指南和技术管理规程，要贯彻保养大型建筑物及养路工作；（十一）线路人员在铺苏联钢轨时，要加垫板，但没有防爬器，还是不行的。接着苏联专家郭尔琴介绍了苏联养路工作的种类、组织和技术标准。苏联养路专家舍洛基指出养路工作要看作是经常工作，不仅是保证行车安全，还须合理运用材料，有组织的分配劳动力，减低成本。最后滕代远部长代表铁道部向苏联专家们表示感谢，并号召全体铁路职工认真学习苏联经验、仔细讨论苏联专家们的讲话，深刻研究两日来的工作报告，克服保守思想，普遍实行新养路方法。　　　　　　　　　　　（陈迹）
