The success of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the birth of the People's Republic of China, the establishment of the Central People's Government, the recognition of our country by the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries, the establishment of the Chinese branch of the World Peace Congress, and the establishment of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association are major events in the history of China and even the world. The important documents published by these major events must be organized for special study in our army.

Generally speaking, these major events signify that the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, are victoriously carrying out two major tasks: first, consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship, and second, uniting international friends. These two major tasks are necessary to carry the revolution through to the end, to build a new China that is independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, prosperous, and strong, and to defend world lasting peace and people's democracy. In order to unify the thinking of the entire army and to implement this overall task, the Party's policies and the publicity and education of patriotism and internationalism should be carried out extensively and deeply throughout the army. The specific provisions are as follows:

(1) Study steps: First, organize cadres to study. At the same time, strengthen the reporting work among soldiers. After the cadre study comes to an end, conduct systematic education for the soldiers.

(2) Study documents for cadres: Focus on Chairman Mao's "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Organic Law of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, the Organic Law of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Chairman Mao's opening speech at the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Comrade Liu Shaoqi's speeches at the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and at the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's speech at the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference as the main materials, supplemented by Xinhua News Agency editorials and other documents.

(3) Key points and requirements for cadre study:

	(1) In connection with the actual situation of the Chinese revolution, truly accept the three main experiences of the Chinese revolution: a Marxist-Leninist party, an army led by such a party, and a people's democratic united front led by such a party. Correct ideological wavering regarding the idea of ​​always being a fighting team, and overcome "left" and right deviations in understanding the united front.

	(2) In connection with current events, truly accept the idea of ​​"leaning to one side," and correct and prevent narrow nationalism and blind xenophobia.

	(3) On the basis of such understanding, carefully study the various policy guidelines stipulated in the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (all including the minimum program of the Chinese Communist Party).

	(4) On the basis of such understanding, strengthen the construction of a regularized and modernized national defense army, firmly protect national defense, protect the interests of the people, and participate in the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union to oppose the imperialist aggressive war conspiracy.

At the same time, on the basis of improved cadre awareness, extensively carry out the Party's policies and the education and publicity of patriotism and internationalism throughout the army.

(4) Study time: Set for one month, and strive to complete it by mid-November. Cadre study will take up two hours of theoretical study time in the morning. Soldier education will take up political class time.

It is hoped that all departments will reflect the effectiveness of the study to this department at any time, and prepare to submit a summary report at the end.
