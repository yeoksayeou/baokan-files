　　Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong Province, is the largest city in South China. It is located at the confluence of the Pearl River, the East River, and the West River, making it extremely convenient for both water and land transportation. The Yuehan Railway and the Guangjiu Railway both start here, extending north to Hankou and south to Kowloon, across from Hong Kong. There is also the Guangsan branch line, which connects to Sanshui, an important commercial port on the West River. Waterways extend along the West River into Guangxi, up the East River to Huiyang, and south through the Pearl River Estuary into the sea, connecting to major commercial ports along China's coast and overseas. Goods from the southern parts of Hunan and Jiangxi provinces, as well as the three provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Guizhou, are all collected and distributed here. According to statistics from June of this year, the city has a population of approximately 1,520,000.
　　Guangzhou was the cradle of the Great Revolution of 1925-1927. In January 1924, Sun Yat-sen, with the assistance of the Chinese Communist Party, reorganized the Kuomintang in Guangzhou and implemented the three major revolutionary policies, making Guangzhou the center of revolutionary leadership. After the "May Thirtieth" Movement in 1925, the Canton-Hong Kong strike broke out in Guangzhou, lasting for two years. In July 1926, the Northern Expedition was launched from Guangzhou. In November 1927, after the failure of China's First Great Revolution, the workers and revolutionary soldiers of Guangdong, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, staged the famous Guangzhou Uprising, establishing China's first revolutionary government of workers, peasants, and soldiers—the Guangzhou Commune.
　　In April of this year, the Chinese People's Liberation Army launched the great campaign to cross the Yangtze River, and on April 23, Nanjing was liberated. After the Kuomintang's twenty-two years of reactionary rule was declared over, remnants of the Kuomintang bandit gang fled to Guangzhou, moving the signboard of the Kuomintang pseudo-central government from Nanjing there, attempting to establish a "base for suppressing the rebellion and counterattacking in South China" with the aid of American imperialism, in order to prolong their lives. However, Guangzhou was liberated in less than two weeks after the People's Liberation Army launched its offensive towards South China; from then on, the remaining forces of the Kuomintang bandit gang have completely become bandits on the run. The People's Liberation Army is now continuing its advance into the southwestern provinces to thoroughly eliminate the remaining bandits. [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 15th]

　　广州介绍
    广州市为广东省省会，华南第一大城市。地当珠江、东江、西江三江汇合之处，水陆交通皆极便利。粤汉铁路和广九铁路即以此为起点，北至汉口，南达香港对岸的九龙。另有广三支线，可通西江重要商埠三水。水路经西江可入广西，经东江可上溯惠阳，南经珠江口入海，可通我国沿海各大商埠及海外各地。湘、赣两省南部及粤、桂、黔三省的货物，均以此为集散地。全市人口据本年六月份的统计约一百五十二万余人。
    广州为一九二五——一九二七年大革命的策源地。一九二四年一月，孙中山在中国共产党协助下，在广州改组国民党，实行革命的三大政策，使广州成为革命领导中心。一九二五年“五卅”运动后，在广州爆发的省港大罢工，曾坚持达两年之久。一九二六年七月，北伐战争由广州发动。一九二七年十一月，中国第一次大革命失败后，广东的工人和革命的士兵，在中国共产党领导下，曾举行了有名的广州暴动，建立了中国第一个工农兵革命政权——广州公社。
    本年四月间，中国人民解放军发起伟大的渡江作战，四月二十三日解放南京。国民党二十二年反动统治宣告灭亡后，国民党匪帮部分残余乃逃集广州，将国民党伪中央政府的招牌，由南京搬到那里，企图在美帝国主义援助下，在那里建立什么“华南戡乱反攻的基地”，以苟延残喘。但此次人民解放军向华南发动攻势不及两周，广州即获解放；从此，国民党匪帮残余势力已完全成为流寇。人民解放军现正在向西南各省继续进军，以彻底肃清残匪。【新华社北京十五日电】
