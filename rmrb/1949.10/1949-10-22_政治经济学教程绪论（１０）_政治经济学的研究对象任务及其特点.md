    The Object of Study, Tasks, and Characteristics of Political Economy

    Chapter One: Mode of Production
    Section One: Productive Forces
    Productive forces exist and develop under historically specific relations of production.
    Productive forces are constantly developing and progressing, but they develop and progress under the condition of combining labor power with the means of production. Because labor power and the means of production are constantly developing and progressing, so too are productive forces. However, productive forces never exist or develop in isolation, but exist and develop under historically specific relations of production. Since ancient times, human production has always been carried out under specific relations of production.

    Section Two: Relations of Production
    Relations of production are, first, the relations formed between people in the process of social production; second, relations that exist independently of people's will, that is, whether people are willing, aware, or unaware, they must form certain relations of production to carry out production. Therefore, relations of production are relations between people that exist objectively and independently of people's subjective will. Third, relations of production are relations of production with certain productive forces as their content, and are relations of production that are adapted to a certain stage of development of productive forces. Therefore, Marx said in the Preface to A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy: "In the social production of their life, men enter into definite relations that are indispensable and independent of their will, namely relations of production appropriate to a given stage in the development of their material forces of production."

    Relations of Production in the Narrow Sense – Relations formed between people in the process of production.
    The relations of production formed between people in the process of production are relations of production in the narrow sense. Because: in order to survive, people must produce material means of subsistence, but people cannot carry out production individually or independently, they must have certain mutual relations with each other in the process of production, that is, form certain relations of production, that is to say, they must carry out production under certain relations of production. These relations of production formed between people in the process of production are mainly manifested in the relations between people and the means of production, that is, the relations of people's ownership of the means of production. This kind of production relation, in a society with a private property system, that is, private ownership of the means of production, is expressed as property relations in law. Therefore, Comrade Stalin explained in Section 2 of Chapter 4 of the Short History of the CPSU (B): "The state of production relations answers the question of who owns the means of production (land, forests, water, mineral resources, raw materials, production tools (mainly referring to the means of labor), production buildings, transportation tools, etc.), who controls the means of production – whether it is controlled by the whole society, or by individual people, groups and classes and used to exploit other people, groups and classes." Because people must have two elements, labor power and the means of production, in order to carry out production, and these two elements must be combined to function, so relations of production, narrowly speaking, are also the combination of labor power and the means of production, and in a society with private ownership of the means of production, it is also a class relation.

    The Relationship between Production, Distribution, and Consumption in a Self-Sufficient Economy
    However, the result of people's production is the production of products, and after the products are produced, they must go through distribution to enter consumption. In a self-sufficient economy, for example, the common products of members of the primitive communist society are distributed by the patriarch. In China's feudal self-sufficient economy, the family products of farmers are distributed to family members by the head of the family. Therefore, people not only engage in certain production under certain relations of production, but also engage in certain distribution. In a self-sufficient society, there are certain relations of production, and then there are certain relations of distribution and certain relations of consumption. However, among all kinds of relations, relations of production are the most basic. Only with relations of production can there be relations of distribution, consumption, and other relations.

　　政治经济学教程绪论（１０）
    政治经济学的研究对象任务及其特点
    王学文
    第一章　生产方式
    第一节　生产力
    生产力是在历史上一定的生产关系下存在和发展着的。
    生产力是继续不断的发展进步的，但它是在劳动力与生产手段相结合的情况之下发展进步的。因为劳动力与生产手段是不断发展进步，所以生产力也是不断地发展进步着的。但是生产力决不是单独存在，和单独发展进步的，而是在历史上一定的生产关系之下存在和发展着的。人类自古以来，其生产就都是在一定的生产关系之下进行的。
    第二节　生产关系
    生产关系，第一，是人与人在社会生产过程中所形成的关系；第二，离开人们的意志而独立存在的关系，即不管人们愿意不愿意，意识到或者没有意识到，人们要进行生产，就必然要结成一定的生产关系才能进行生产。所以生产关系是离开人们的主观意志，而独立客观存在的人与人的关系。第三，生产关系是以一定的生产力为内容的生产关系，并且是与一定的生产力发展阶段相适应的生产关系。故马克思在政治经济学批判序言中说过：“人类在其生活的社会的生产中结成一定的、必然的、离开其意志而独立的关系，即与其物质生产力的一定发展阶段相适应的生产关系”。
    狭义的生产关系——人们在生产过程中形成的关系。
    人与人在生产过程中形成的生产关系，为狭义的生产关系。因为：人们为了要生存，就要去生产物质生活资料，但人们要进行生产，不是个别地、单独地所能去进行的，必须在生产过程中彼此发生一定的相互关系，就是说形成一定的生产关系，也就是说必须要在一定的生产关系下去进行生产。这种人们在生产过程中形成的生产关系，主要表现于人们与生产手段的关系，即人们对于生产手段的占有关系，这种生产关系，在私有财产制度即生产手段私有的社会里，就表现为法律上的财产关系，所以斯大林同志在联共（布）党史简明教程第四章第二节中说明着：“生产关系底状况所回答的则是生产手段（土地、森林、水流、矿源、原料生产工具（主要指劳动手段而言），生产建筑物，交通联络工具等等）归谁所有，生产手段由谁支配——由全社会支配，还是由单个的人、集团和阶级支配并利用去剥削其他的人、集团和阶级的问题。”因为人们要进行生产，必须具有劳动力与生产手段两个要素，并且这两个要素必须结合起来才能发生作用，所以生产关系狭义地说来，又是劳动力与生产手段的结合关系，在生产手段私有的社会里，便同时是阶级关系。
    在自足自给的经济下生产与分配消费的关系
    可是，人们进行生产的结果，是生产出生产物来，生产物生产出来以后，就要经过分配进入消费。在自给自足的经济下，例如原始共产社会氏族成员共同的生产物，由族长来进行共同的分配。中国封建的自给自足经济下，农民的家庭生产物，由家长分配给家族成员。所以，人不但在一定的生产关系下进行一定的生产，而且还要进行一定的分配，在自给自足的社会里，有一定的生产关系，才有一定的分配关系与一定的消费关系，但是在各种关系中，生产关系是基本的，有了生产关系，才能有分配、消费等关系。　　　　　　　　　　（未完）
