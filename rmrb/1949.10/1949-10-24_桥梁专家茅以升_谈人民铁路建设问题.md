　　Bridge Expert Mao Yisheng
　　Discusses People's Railway Construction Issues
At the National Railway Engineering Conference, Minister Teng Daiyuan called on railway employees to strive to complete the Beijing-Hankou, Guangdong-Hankou, and Datong-Puzhou Railways by the end of this year, and to complete the Datong-Tanggu, Baotou-Ningxia, Tianshui-Lanzhou lines, as well as the double-tracking of the China Changchun Railway and the Beijing-Shenyang line next year. He also requested early preparations for the construction of the Yangtze River and Yellow River bridges. How to complete this arduous and glorious task, and what problems will arise in the future construction of the People's Railway, are issues that people urgently need to know. When the reporter asked Chinese bridge expert Mao Yisheng about this, he said that the task is now very urgent, and both repair, restoration, and new construction work must be taken into account. Therefore, it is necessary to fully utilize and coordinate the maximum effectiveness of manpower, material resources, and financial resources in order to save time and achieve victory. Can the current manpower, material resources, and financial resources bear the future tasks? Mr. Mao believes that there is not much of a problem. There are difficulties, but they can ultimately be overcome. In terms of manpower, he said that our most superior condition now is the high political consciousness, hard work, endurance, and unwavering courage of the working class. The problem now is how to improve technology. In this regard, Mr. Mao feels that there should be two understandings: First, we must make the greatest effort to educate workers with technical theory, and like us learning from their labor, combine their practical experience with technical theory. Second, learn from the Soviet Union. After the October Revolution in the Soviet Union, their nation-building situation had many similarities to ours. As long as we earnestly learn from them, we will definitely make great progress. For example, after the Soviet Union's new track maintenance method was introduced to us, our track maintenance work has achieved new success. The same is true in the technical field. The Soviet Union is our teacher. Mr. Mao said excitedly, citing an example, that in the past, our standard drawings for steel bridges had many similarities with those currently used in the Soviet Union. For example, the "section" of the standard design steel bridge truss is usually not uniform; however, the sections designed by the China Bridge Company in the past were uniform, conforming to economic principles, and today the designs of Soviet experts are also the same. This situation really makes us happy. There are too many things we need to learn from the Soviet Union. All of our engineers should earnestly learn Russian and Soviet technology to solve our own problems. In addition, training a large number of engineering students, so that their theory and practice are consistent, is also a major task at present.
　　As for material resources, Mr. Mao advocated using domestically produced materials. Chinese materials can be used after improvement. For example, good wood can be used for twenty or thirty years. Some materials that can be produced domestically, such as cement and steel bars, need to increase production, which can solve the material supply for reinforced concrete bridges. Although domestic materials are not sufficient, we must try every means to minimize the use of foreign materials. When building bridges, it is advisable to use more reinforced concrete, which is economical and domestically produced. Try to use old bridge steel materials as much as possible, which can solve part of the difficulty in steel bridge materials.
　　Speaking of financial resources, he said that railway construction requires a lot of funds. In the past, relying on imperialism to build railways was doomed to failure. In the future, we should rely on our own efforts, and the Soviet Union can help us with steel rails, and we can exchange them with other materials in batches.
　　In the construction process, we must adhere to the principle of economy and do the most with the least amount of money. Railway engineering construction is seasonal. The manpower and financial resources spent on the same project vary greatly in different seasons. Spring and autumn are different. For example, autumn is more rainy, and the project is much more troublesome than in spring. If the plan is carefully planned in advance, seize the time, and strive to complete the project before the rainy season, it will avoid a lot of waste.
　　After a project is completed, it is important to pay attention to maintenance, which is also an important issue. Today, everyone at the National Railway Engineering Conference attaches great importance to track maintenance, which is absolutely correct. Maintenance work is as important as consolidating the victory of the war. This year's floods were severe, and many line projects were damaged. Therefore, it is very necessary to renovate riverbanks and rivers. In the future, we must expand the scope of track maintenance work. Whether it is in terms of lines, bridges, or water conservancy and ports, we need to carry out maintenance work.
　　Regarding the issue of bridge construction, Mr. Mao advocated standardizing bridge design. Many bridges have been damaged in the past, which gives us the opportunity to promote standardization as much as possible. He said that standardization has many benefits. For example, steel beams can be moved from place to place, parts can be manufactured uniformly, equipped easily, and save manpower and time.
　　Mr. Mao has designed the Yangtze River and Yellow River bridges. He believes that when planning bridges, we should consider whether it is necessary to have a bridge to cross the river. In some places, tunnels may be used, but not necessarily for air defense purposes, because the destructive power of future air raids is difficult to estimate now. Mr. Mao believes that neither tunnels nor bridges are absolutely safe or absolutely unsafe. For air raids, only active air defense and improvements in architectural design are effective. The question is which one is most economical. Generally speaking, tunnels are much more expensive than bridges, and it takes longer to build tunnels; if the railway needs double tracks, it will take more work and time than bridges. Tunnels require ventilation and lighting equipment, and steam locomotives are not suitable, requiring electric locomotives. The so-called economic principle is to consider the terrain. Which place is suitable for tunnels, and which place is suitable for bridges. For example, although Wuhan needs to pass large ships, it has the natural conditions of Turtle Mountain and Snake Mountain, with high banks on both sides, and building bridges is cheaper than tunnels; Zhengzhou has fewer large ships, and bridges are cheaper than tunnels; Shanghai's Huangpu River has many ships coming and going, and bridges need to be built very high, which is more expensive than tunnels. Between Nanjing and Pukou, tunnels may be more economical.
　　Mr. Mao said that it is of course difficult to build such large bridges. However, the labor enthusiasm of the working class, the enthusiastic help of the Soviet Union, the heroic struggle of all the people, especially under the leadership of the great leader of the people, Chairman Mao, will surely overcome all difficulties and build a strong and prosperous new China.

　　桥梁专家茅以升
  　谈人民铁路建设问题
    在全国铁路工务会议上，滕代远部长号召铁路员工争取今年年底修通京汉、粤汉、同蒲三路，明年完成同塘、包（头）宁（夏）、天（水）兰（州）线及中长、京沈复线，并要求对于长江、黄河大桥的新建工作早做准备。这艰巨的光荣的任务如何完成，今后建设人民铁路究竟有些什么问题，是人们所迫切需要知道的。记者以此问题询问中国桥梁专家茅以升，他说，现在任务很迫切，抢修、修复和新建工作，都要照顾。所以必须充分发挥并配合人力、物力、财力的最大效用，始能争取时间，胜利完成。目前人力物力财力是否可以担负起今后的任务？茅先生认为是没有多大问题的。困难是有的，但终能战胜。在人力方面，他说，我们现在最优越的条件就是工人阶级的政治觉悟高，吃苦耐劳，坚毅英勇。今后的问题是如何提高技术。在这方面，茅先生觉得应有两点认识：第一，必须尽最大的努力教育工人以技术理论，和我们向他们学习劳动一样，把他们的实际经验和技术理论结合起来。第二，学习苏联。苏联十月革命以后，他们的建国情形有很多地方是和我们相同的，只要我们认真地去学习他们，一定会大有进步。比如苏联新养路法介绍给我们以后，我们的养路工作，就有了新的成功。技术方面也是一样，苏联是我们的老师。茅先生谈到这里，兴奋地举例说，过去我们设计的钢桥标准图样，和现在苏联采用的有很多相同的地方。比方标准设计钢桥桁梁的“节间”，普通是不统一的；但过去中国桥梁公司设计的节间是统一的，合乎经济原则，今天苏联专家的设计也是如此，这个情形真使我们高兴。我们要向苏联学习的东西太多了，我们全体工程师，应该切实地学习俄文，学习苏联技术，来解决我们自己的问题。此外，锻炼大批工科学生，使他们的理论和实际一致，也是目前一大课题。
    至于物力方面，茅先生主张采用本国出产的器材。中国材料，经过改良都可以采用，例如好的木料即可以用到二三十年。有些能在国内出产的材料如洋灰、钢筋等，需要增加生产，可以解决钢筋混凝土桥梁的材料供给。虽然国内材料不能足够应用，但总要多方设法，尽量少用外国材料。建筑桥梁，不妨多用钢筋混凝土，又经济，国内又有出产。尽量利用旧桥钢料，可以解决一部分钢桥材料的困难。
    谈到财力问题，他说，建设铁路需要很大经费。在以往，依靠帝国主义来建设铁路，那是注定要失败的。今后我们应当自力更生，并可以由苏联帮助我们钢轨，我们以别种物资分批与其交换。
    在建设过程中，要本着经济的原则，以最少的钱办最大的事。铁路工程建设是有季节性的。同样一个工程，在不同的季节里，所花费的人力财力就大有不同。春季和秋季就不一样。如秋季多雨，工程就比春季麻烦多了。如果事先计划周密，把握时间，争取在雨季以前完工，那就避免了许多的浪费。
    一个工程完了以后，必须注意保养，也是一个重要问题。今天全国铁路工务会议，大家都非常重视养路工作，这是万分正确的。保养工作，就如同巩固战争胜利成果一样的重要。今年水患严重，损坏了不少线路工程。因此整治河岸河流，就非常必要了。今后我们要把养路工作的范围扩大起来，无论线路、桥梁或水利、港口方面，都需要展开保养工作。
    关于桥梁修建问题，茅先生主张设计桥梁要标准化。过去桥梁破坏的很多，正给了我们尽量推行标准化的机会。他说，标准统一了，好处很多，例如钢梁可以各地移动，零件可以统一制造，配备容易，而且节省人力和时间。
    茅先生曾经设计过长江、黄河大桥。他认为计划桥梁时，应考虑过河是否一定需要桥梁。有些地方，可能采用地道，但不一定是为了防空关系，因将来空袭破坏的能力，现在是很难估计的。茅先生以为地道与桥梁，都不是绝对安全或绝对不安全的，对于空袭，只有积极防空，并在建筑设计上改良。问题还是在于两者谁最合乎经济原则。一般说来，地道要比桥梁贵得多，并且建筑地道费时较长；如铁路需要双线，那就比桥梁更费工费时了。地道需要通风和照明的设备，而且行走蒸气机车不适宜，需要电气机车。所谓经济原则，就是要考虑地形问题。那个地方适合地道，那个地方适合桥梁。比如武汉虽要通过大船，但有龟山蛇山的天然条件，两岸高，建筑桥梁就要比地道便宜；郑州通航的大船少，桥梁也比地道便宜；上海黄浦江来往船多，桥梁要建筑得很高，较比地道贵得多。南京浦口间，也许是地道较省钱。
    新建这样的大桥，茅先生说，当然是有困难的。但是工人阶级的劳动热情，苏联的热心帮助，全体人民的英勇奋斗，尤其是在人民伟大领袖毛主席的领导下，一定可以克服一切困难，把新中国强盛的建设起来。
