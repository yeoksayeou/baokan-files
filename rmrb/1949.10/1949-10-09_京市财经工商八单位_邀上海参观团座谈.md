    [Beijing News] The first delegation of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce Preparatory Committee Northeast and North China Visiting Group arrived in the capital. On the second day (the 8th), the Beijing Municipal People's Government Finance and Economics Committee, Industry Bureau, Commerce Bureau, Municipal People's Bank, Municipal Cooperative General Society, Trade Steering Committee, and Municipal Industrial Association and Chamber of Commerce jointly invited the delegation to a symposium and banquet. Cheng Hongyi, Deputy Director of the Finance and Economics Committee, chaired the symposium. At the meeting, Deputy Director Cheng, Fu Huating of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Liu Yifeng, and Wang Xiangchen of the Industrial Association delivered welcome speeches and briefly reported on the recovery and development of industry and commerce in Beijing after liberation. Deputy Director Cheng pointed out in his welcome speech that the purpose of the symposium was to learn from each other and exchange information. Fu Huating, speaking as a member of the business community, introduced the government's guidance and progress in labor-management relations, taxation, urban-rural trade, market management, and industrial and commercial registration after Beijing's liberation. He said, "In general, under the full leadership of the People's Government, industry and commerce in Beijing have recovered and developed after liberation." Liu Yifeng, after discussing the favorable conditions for production and trade in Beijing, expressed the hope that Shanghai's industrialists and businessmen could allocate some of their resources to develop in the north. Subsequently, Hu Juewen, the head of the delegation, and Gao Shiheng, the general secretary, spoke, thanking Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu for leading the People's Liberation Army to liberate Shanghai, and thanking the people of North China for their strong material assistance to Shanghai. They also reported on the situation of industry and commerce in Shanghai. Shanghai has a very good industrial foundation, and under the guidance of the correct policies of the People's Government, it has mostly recovered and developed. In the future, Shanghai can supply North China with various light industrial products such as cotton yarn, cloth, flour, rubber products, hardware, enamelware, machinery, sacks, medicines, and silk; at the same time, it is hoped that North China will continue to supply Shanghai with large quantities of coal, cotton, wheat, rapeseed, food, and other raw materials. In his concluding remarks, Deputy Director Cheng expressed the hope that Shanghai industrialists and businessmen would come to Beijing to jointly build a new people's capital.
    The members of the delegation have now been divided into six groups according to their industries: machinery, textiles, chemicals, agricultural economics, business administration, and finance, trade, and transportation. They will leave Beijing for Shenyang tomorrow.
