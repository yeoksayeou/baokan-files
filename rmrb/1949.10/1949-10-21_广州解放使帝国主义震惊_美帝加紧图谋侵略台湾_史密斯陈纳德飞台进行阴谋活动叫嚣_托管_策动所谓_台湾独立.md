Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 19th -- Recently, reactionary American newspapers have been constantly clamoring for "trusteeship of Taiwan." The invasionists Smith and Chennault have successively flown to Taiwan to carry out conspiracy activities, and the American spy Liao Wenyi is also running around everywhere. This shows that after the liberation of Guangzhou, the U.S. imperialists' plot to annex China's territory of Taiwan Province has become even more intensified. Smith is a member of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a member of the Economic Cooperation Administration Supervisory Committee. He suddenly flew to Taiwan on the 16th of this month. Also on the same flight was Whillier, special assistant to the government group of the "Allied Headquarters" stationed in Japan. Smith flew from the U.S. to Japan at the beginning of the month to "discuss the situation in Japan and the Far East" with U.S. Commander in Japan MacArthur. Before flying to Taiwan, he made a statement saying, "It is very important to prevent Taiwan from falling into the hands of the Communists." After Smith and his party arrived in Taipei, they immediately held a secret two-hour talk with the bandit leader Chiang Kai-shek. Smith and others flew back to Tokyo on the 17th. On the same day that Smith flew to Taiwan, Chennault also flew from Hong Kong to Taipei to "meet and talk" with the Chiang bandit. After the secret meeting between Smith, Whillier, Chennault, and the bandit leader Chiang Kai-shek, rumors spread in Taipei on the 17th that "Taiwan will be placed under U.S. trusteeship" and that "Taiwan's 'defense' will be assisted by the U.S. Navy, Army, and Air Force for 'joint defense'." The Washington Post, which has close ties with the U.S. State Department, shamelessly claimed on the 2nd of this month that "Taiwan is an indispensable part of the anti-communist defense line."

At the same time as the so-called "trusteeship of Taiwan" activities, U.S. imperialism is instigating its running dogs, such as the notorious American spy Liao Wenyi, to intensify their clamoring for so-called "Taiwan independence." The bandit Liao Wenyi flew to the Philippines on the 12th of this month to carry out activities. U.S. imperialism is encouraging its Philippine puppets to come forward to support the so-called "Taiwan independence activities." On the 15th of this month, the day after the Chinese People's Liberation Army liberated Guangzhou, the largest port in South China, Liao Wenyi's henchmen once again uttered the mad dog barks of "Taiwan independence" in Hong Kong. All these activities of U.S. imperialism expose its persistent face of aggression against China.

　　广州解放使帝国主义震惊
  　美帝加紧图谋侵略台湾
    史密斯陈纳德飞台进行阴谋活动叫嚣“托管”策动所谓“台湾独立”
    【新华社北京十九日电】最近美国反动报纸又不断地发出“托管台湾”的嚣，侵略分子史密斯、陈纳德相继飞到台湾进行阴谋活动，美国间谍廖文毅也到处奔走，显示广州解放以后，美国帝国主义吞并中国领土台湾省的图谋更加加紧。史密斯是美国参议院外交委员会委员兼经合总署监督委员会委员，他于本月十六日突然飞抵台湾，同机到台的还有驻日“盟总”政府组特别助理惠利尔。史密斯系于月初由美飞日与美国驻日统帅麦克阿瑟“讨论日本与远东情势”。他在飞台前曾发表谈话说：“使台湾不落入共产党手中是十分重要的。”史密斯一行飞抵台北后，当日即与匪首蒋介石密谈两小时之久。史密斯等已于十七日飞回东京。在史密斯飞台湾的同一天，陈纳德也由香港飞到台北与蒋贼“晤谈”。在史密斯、惠利尔、陈纳德与匪首蒋介石秘密会谈之后，十七日台北即盛传“台湾将由美国托管”和“台湾‘防务’由美国海陆空军协助‘联防’”。与美国国务院有密切关系的华盛顿邮报则曾于本月二日曾无耻地声称：“台湾是反共防线不可缺少的一部分。”
    与所谓“托管台湾”的活动同时，美国帝国主义正策动它的走狗臭名昭著的美国间谍廖文毅之流加紧叫喊所谓“台湾独立”。廖匪文毅已于本月十二日飞到菲律宾活动。美国帝国主义正怂恿它的菲律宾傀儡出面支持所谓“台湾独立活动”。本月十五日，即中国人民解放军解放华南最大港口广州的第二天，廖文毅的爪牙又在香港发出“台湾独立”的狂吠。美国帝国主义的这一切活动，都暴露了它的坚持侵略中国的面目。
