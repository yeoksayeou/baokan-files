On the night of October 27th, Kuomintang Central Air Transport Corporation pilots Lü Jiren, co-pilot Xie Chaoqun, mechanic Yang Zhaopan, and maintenance worker Su Wenhuan, flew a (C-47) transport plane from Hong Kong and defected to the Motherland. After a long flight, the plane has now landed safely at an airport in a certain area and received a warm welcome from the local military and civilians.

On the 27th, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army annihilated the fleeing enemy's Second Security Division directly under its command and the remnants of its subordinate regiments in the Duhou area north of Chixi on the coast of Guangdong, capturing over 1,100 enemy soldiers and seizing 17 heavy machine guns, 25 light machine guns, one mortar, eight 60mm mortars, three direct-fire guns, and six grenade launchers.
　　
　　Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 30th. Six hundred and eighty-one officers and soldiers of the First Brigade of the Provisional Third Division, the remnant forces of the bandit Song Xilian entrenched in Taoyuan, Hunan, surrendered to the People's Liberation Army under the suppression of the bandit suppression forces of the Changde Military Subdistrict of the People's Liberation Army. The bandit force was formed by merging the Taoyuan puppet Self-Defense Headquarters, Police Brigade, Standing Brigade, and Directly Subordinate Brigade. After the First Detachment of the Changde Military Subdistrict accepted the task of suppressing the bandits, they set out on separate routes on the 13th of this month, quickly compressing the bandits into the Dongxi River area between Taoyuan and Yuanling, and immediately organized an attack. When the People's Liberation Army approached the bandit's station, Yu Qianwu (puppet Taoyuan County Magistrate), the Deputy Brigade Commander of the Provisional Third Division of the bandit, and Guo Wusheng (puppet Taoyuan Longchi Township Mayor), the Second Regiment Commander, sent people to surrender to the People's Liberation Army. On the 19th, all 681 bandits laid down their weapons, including 76 bandit officers above the rank of lieutenant. The People's Liberation Army seized a total of six heavy machine guns, thirteen light machine guns, forty American-made automatic rifles, and 584 rifles and pistols. At this point, the large group of bandits in Taoyuan had been completely wiped out. The people celebrated the victory of the bandit suppression.
