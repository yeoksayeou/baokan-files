Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 28th:

The delegation from China that attended the World Federation of Trade Unions Congress arrived in Shanghai on the 23rd and is now actively engaged in activities. They are maintaining broad contact with the city's million-strong working masses, reporting to the workers on their experiences abroad, conveying the resolutions of the World Federation of Trade Unions Congress, and introducing their observations in the Soviet Union and various New Democratic countries in Eastern Europe. On the 25th, the delegation visited twenty-one state-owned and private cotton mills in the Hudong and Huxi industrial districts, including the No. 6 and No. 10 factories of the China Textile Corporation, the No. 9 factory of the Shenxin Corporation, and the Huafeng and Xinyu cotton mills, reaching over 50,000 workers. On the 26th, the delegation visited a total of twenty units, including the No. 1, No. 2, No. 3, and No. 4 factories of the China Textile Corporation, the No. 1 and No. 5 factories of the Yong'an Corporation, the Tongyi and Xinfu cotton mills, the East China People's Revolutionary University, and the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau, giving reports to a total audience of over 26,000 people. The delegation was universally warmly welcomed by the workers wherever they went; in particular, the presence of five Shanghai worker leaders in the delegation made the Shanghai workers feel even closer. Whenever members of the delegation spoke of the further recovery and development of industry and agriculture in the Eastern European New Democratic countries with the help of the Soviet Union, the Shanghai workers were greatly excited. They firmly believe that the arduous process of building a new China can also be shortened with the help of advanced Soviet technology. In order to respond to the warm welcome of the million Shanghai workers, the delegation is now continuing to visit workers in various industries and factories throughout the city, according to the planned schedule.
