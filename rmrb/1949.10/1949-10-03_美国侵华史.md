　　A History of American Aggression Against China
    Four: Exclusive Control of China
    (Continued from XXVII)
    This means that America's plan to defeat the Chinese people had once again failed, and they could no longer appear as "mediators." Although on August 30th, the United States again sold "surplus materials" with a cost of $837 million to Chiang Kai-shek at a low price of $175 million, allowing him to obtain more tools for slaughtering the Chinese people, and in December, Marshall and Stuart Leighton directed a farce for Chiang Kai-shek, convening a "National Assembly" and announcing a "constitution," which was promoted by the US Ambassador to China, Stuart Leighton, as "both in line with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and full of democratic spirit"...etc., it was unable to save the doomed failure. On January 29, 1947, the US government officially announced its "decision to terminate its relationship with the Three-Man Group," withdrawing from its pretense of mediation, openly revealing its ferocious one-sided face, and taking its chess piece for conquering the Chinese people to the last step, making people clearly recognize that the United States had completely replaced Japan in China, and Chiang Kai-shek had replaced Wang Jingwei. The American aggressors could no longer use any conspiracies or deceptions.
    In January of the same year, the American reactionary leader Vandenberg first openly ordered Chiang Kai-shek to form a "league of parties with the Communist Party outside," and a "united government without the participation of the Communist Party," to organize and utilize all the anti-revolutionary forces outside of Chiang Kai-shek. In April of the same year, Chiang Kai-shek complied. In July, Wedemeyer returned to China for "investigation" and formulated a huge plan for Chiang Kai-shek: dividing China into six regions militarily. In addition to wanting to completely control the Northwest, Southwest, and South China regions under the pretexts of "defense against the Soviet Union," "transportation," and "construction," the remaining regions required Chiang Kai-shek to fight more resolutely for it, such as in North China, "the United States requires the Central Army to do its best to hold this area no matter what," and in Central China, it was stipulated that "at least it must be able to defend for two years." Politically, it was determined that: "The United States does not object to the Chinese government using force to suppress parties that do not participate in government organizations (originally referring to the Democratic League), and the activities of other people who do not cooperate with the government can also be suppressed... The Chiang regime is the only controlling force in China and must be consolidated." (Note: Li Qiang, translated: The Truth About the Wedemeyer Plan, reprinted from the China Digest, Hong Kong, November 18, 1947.) Accompanying Wedemeyer to China was also the former ambassador to the Soviet Union and France, war-monger Bullitt, who made the decision for Chiang Kai-shek to "defeat the CCP in three years." After returning to the United States, he "executed the instructions of the State Department" and published a presumptuous report, believing that the United States should use $1.35 billion in "cheap cost" to hire 400 million Chinese people to destroy China in the name of "anti-Soviet," and make MacArthur, who occupied Japan, the "commander" in charge of China. In September and October of the same year, an American military inspection team went to China and successively "inspected" Beijing, Qingdao, Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places. The head of the inspection team, Cole, chairman of the Military Committee of the US House of Representatives, made speeches in Nanjing for several days, fully agreeing with Bullitt's plan to aid Chiang and destroy China. In April 1948, the US government again gave Chiang Kai-shek a huge loan of $463 million in its foreign aid bill to enslave the world, just like it had used Cao Kun to bribe voters twenty-four years ago, to instruct Chiang Kai-shek to use "election" to rise from "Chairman" to "President," hoping that he could therefore more effectively carry out the task of the United States against the Chinese people.
    But even at this time, the United States itself had not completely abandoned the attempt to exercise some conspiracies, especially when the United States saw that Chiang's army was continuously and massively annihilated in the Chinese People's Great Revolutionary march, and the ruling power of the Chiang's party showed signs of collapse. When deciding to celebrate for Chiang Kai-shek, it also decided to hold a funeral for him. This is why the United States insisted on having Li Zongren, who was known for "anti-Chiang" and supported by miscellaneous warlords, seize the position of "Vice President." Its role was: when the military situation further deteriorated and Chiang Kai-shek himself was unable to maintain it, Li Zongren could come out in an "anti-Chiang" posture to take over Chiang Kai-shek's task. At the end of April, in the "election" of "Vice President," the United States did its best to support Li Zongren, and Stuart Leighton personally came forward to "persuade Sun Ke to withdraw," so that Li Zongren won. After the election, the American reactionary propaganda organs unanimously praised Li Zongren. The New York Herald Tribune's Shanghai dispatch on April 25 said: "If the opportunity for peace talks with the CCP arrives, Li Zongren is far more easily accepted by the Communist side than Chiang." The United Press International dispatch from Peiping on May 1: "General Li Zongren's election as Vice President... is the most hopeful opportunity for the Kuomintang government to correct the rudder since Marshall attempted to quell (?) the turbulent waves of the Chinese civil war in 1946." The New York Herald Tribune simply stated in its editorial on April 30: "Li Zongren's election as Vice President is to put one of the most vocal advocates of reform that the Republic of China can offer in a high position... This is also an opinion that American officials often advocate."

　　美国侵华史
    四　独占中国
    （续二十七）
    这是说，美国打败中国人民的计划又一次破产，他们无法再以“调停者”的面目出现了。虽然八月三十日美国再以成本八亿三千七百万美元的“剩余物资”作成一亿七千五百万美元的低价售予蒋介石，让他获得更多屠杀中国人的工具，十二月又由马歇尔司徒雷登为蒋介石导演了一幕召开“国民代表大会”，公布“宪法”的丑剧，并由美驻华大使司徒雷登宣传为“既合政协决议，尤充满民主精神”……等等，但对注定了的失败，已无能挽救。一九四七年一月二十九日，美国政府正式宣布“决定终止与三人小组之关系”，退出伪装调处，公开狰狞的一面倒的面目，把它征服中国人民的棋子走到最后一步，使人们明确认识美国在中国完全代替了日本，而蒋介石则代替了汪精卫，美国侵略者也再无法施展什么阴谋诡计和欺骗技俩了。
    同年一月，美国反动头子范登堡首先公开命令蒋介石要组成一个“共产党在外的党派联盟”，和一个“没有共产党参加的联合政府”把蒋介石以外的一切反革命势力都组织起来加以利用，同年四月、蒋介石即遵照执行。七月间，魏德迈重来中国“调查”，为蒋介石制定一庞大计划：在军事上分中国为六个区，除了想把西北、西南、华南三区在“防苏”“交通”“建设”等借口下完全掌握到美国手里而外，其余的区则要蒋介石更坚决为它作战，如在华北“美国要求中央军无论如何要尽力守住这一区”华中则规定“至少要能防守至二年之久”，政治上确定为：“美国不反对中国政府以武力弹压不参加政府组织的党派（原按：指民主同盟）其他不与政府合作的人民活动也可以镇压……蒋政权为中国唯一统制力量，必须使之巩固。”（注：李强译：魏德迈计划真相，转载香港一九四七年十一月十八日，中国文摘。）与魏德迈同时来华的，还有前驻苏法大使，战争贩子布立特，他给蒋介石作出“三年击败中共”的决定，回到美国后又“执行国务院的指令”发表一个狂妄报告，认为美国应该用十三亿五千万美元“低廉代价”雇佣四万万中国人在“反苏”名义下替美国灭亡中国，而以占领日本的麦克阿瑟为管辖中国“统帅”。同年九十月间，美国军事考察团又到中国，先后“考察”北京、青岛、南京、上海等地，考察团团长——美国会众议院军事委员会主席柯尔在南京连日发表谈话，对布立特的援蒋灭华计划完全同意。一九四八年四月，美政府又在它奴役世界的援外法案中再给蒋介石四亿六千三百万美元的巨额贷款，就象二十四年以前支使曹锟贿选一样，来支使蒋介石用“选举”的方式由“主席”升为“总统”，希望他能因此更有效地执行美国反对中国人民的任务。
    但直到这时，美国本身仍没有完全放弃行使一些阴谋诡计的企图，特别是当美国看到蒋军在中国人民大革命进军中连续大量被歼，蒋党统治力量呈显士崩瓦解之象，在决定给蒋介石做喜事的时候，也就决定给他做丧事，这就是美国坚持要以“反蒋”著称，为杂牌军阀所支持的李宗仁攫得“副总统”位子。其作用是：俟军事局面进一步恶化，蒋介石本人已无法维持的时候，李宗仁便可以“反蒋”姿态出而接替蒋介石的任务，在四月底，“副总统”“选举”中，美国竭力为李宗仁撑腰，司徒雷登亲自出马“劝请孙科退出”，使李宗仁获胜。选举后，美国反动言论机关又一致为李捧场，纽约先驱论坛报四月二十五日上海电讯说：“假如与中共议和的时机到来，李宗仁远较蒋易为共方接受。”五月一日合众社北平电：“李宗仁将军当选副总统………是自一九四六年马歇尔试图平息（？）中国内战的惊涛骇浪以来，国民党政府可以拨正船舵的最有希望的机会。”纽约前锋论坛报在四月三十日的社论中则干脆说：“李宗仁当选副总统，是把中华民国所能提到的一位最出力主张改革的人，扮上崇高的职位………这也是美国官员所时常倡导的意见。”
