　　Tens of Millions of Eyes Facing the Red Square of the East
    Let the enemy tremble! Four hundred seventy-five million Chinese people have stood up. On October 1st, the People's Republic of China was proclaimed in front of Tiananmen Square. Today, 300,000 people from the capital have gathered here. The Five-Star Red Flags flowing in from all directions shine with infinite light. Workers, farmers, soldiers, students, and government personnel surging in from all over the country are all facing one direction, facing Chairman Mao.
    Only eight months ago, this place was subjected to the humiliation of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries; a year and a half ago, the Chinese people's anti-American and pro-Japanese movement here was obstructed by the enemy; three years ago, Chinese students marched through here roaring "Yankee Go Home!"; thirteen years ago, the Chinese people's anti-Japanese national salvation movement was resisted by the clubs and water cannons of the warlord Song Zheyuan; thirty years ago, the May Fourth Movement also shouted out from here. For more than twenty years, the Chinese people's anti-imperialist struggle has been repeatedly sabotaged by the reactionaries. However, for more than twenty years, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, have fought with the enemy, overthrown the reactionary regime, and driven away the imperialists.
    The Chinese people have won! Today we are here rejoicing and celebrating. People all over the world are watching us with joy. Our workers have leveled the roads here, installed electric lights, and erected a huge iron flagpole that pierces the sky. Our young students have used labor days to fill in the uneven ground here. Let us happily watch here! Tiananmen, this fortress that was once the bastion of feudal emperors, has been painted bright red by the people, and the national flags of the people are planted on both sides. The giant statue of the people's leader is suspended in the center. How many eyes are watching it! How many people are cheering for it! White-haired old men, wrinkled old women, strong young men and women, and lively children come here and stare at it. It symbolizes the victory of the people, it is the crystallization of the blood and sweat of millions of people, it is the Red Square of the East.
    The great people's leader, Chairman Mao, announced the establishment of the People's Republic of China to the world here. The entire East shone brightly, inspiring more than a billion oppressed people in colonial and semi-colonial countries, and shaking every corner of the world. Chiang Kai-shek's remnants trembled, and the imperialists panicked.
    Commander-in-Chief Zhu ordered the Chinese People's Liberation Army here to continue to advance bravely, eliminate all reactionary forces, and defend the motherland's defense. Look! The heroic People's Liberation Army infantry is marching forward, the air force is soaring in the sky, and the navy is constantly growing. What a great people's armed force! What heroic and vigorous posture! The People's Republic of China has a strong protector, and the future of the new China's construction is infinitely bright.
    The Red Square of the East, the Chinese people surround it, decorate it with lanterns and colorful decorations, fireworks are set off, cheers roar, Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the People's Republic of China! From now on, we Chinese people will no longer be bullied or oppressed by others. We stand tall in the East of the earth. A Chinese youth who returned from attending the Second Congress of the World Federation of Democratic Youth jumped and said in the meeting place: "How glorious we are in the world!" An international friend sitting on the viewing platform on the left side of Tiananmen Square shook the reporter's hand and said: "The establishment of the People's Republic of China is an important pillar of world peace."

　　千万双眼睛向着东方的红场
    让敌人发抖吧！四万万七千五百万中国人民站立起来了，十月一日在天安门前宣告成立了中华人民共和国。今天，三十万首都人民汇集到这里，从四面八方流来的五星红旗呵！光芒万道；由东南西北涌来的工人、农民、战士、学生、机关人员，都向着一个方向，向着毛主席。
    还是在八个月以前，这个地方是受着帝国主义和国民党反动派侮辱的；一年半以前，在这里的中国人民反美帝扶日运动曾遭到敌人的阻挠；三年前，中国学生经过这里怒吼着“美军滚出去”；十三年前，中国人民抗日救亡运动曾受到军阀宋哲元的木棍水龙的抵挡；三十年前，五四运动也是从这里喊出去的。二十多年来，中国人民反帝的斗争，是一再被反动派破坏的；然而，二十多年来，中国人民是一直在中国共产党的领导下，和敌人搏斗，推翻了反动政权，赶走了帝国主义。
    中国人民胜利了，今天我们在这里欢腾鼓舞，世界人民都欢跃地看着我们。我们的工人把这里的马路修平了，电灯按装起来了，巨大的铁旗杆插入高空；我们的青年学生，用劳动日填平了这里凸凹的地面。让我们欢乐地在这里看吧！天安门，这座曾是封建帝王的堡垒，已被人民油漆得通红发亮，人民的国旗插满两旁，人民领袖的巨像悬在中央。多少双眼睛望着它！多少万人向它欢呼！白发长须的老人，绉纹满面的老大娘，身强力壮的青年男女，活活泼泼的小孩，走到这里，都凝视着它，它象征了人民的胜利，它是千百万人民血汗的结晶，它是东方的红场。
    伟大的人民领袖毛主席在这里向世界宣布了中华人民共和国的成立，整个东方发了亮，鼓舞了十亿多殖民地半殖民地被压迫的人民，震撼了世界的每个角落，蒋介石残匪发抖，帝国主义者惊慌。
    朱总司令在这里命令中国人民解放军，继续奋勇前进，消灭一切反动势力，保卫祖国国防。看吧！英勇的人民解放军陆军在踏步迈进，空军在天空翱翔，海军在不断生长。好伟大的人民武装呵！好英勇的矫健姿态呵！中华人民共和国有了坚强的保卫者，新中国建设的前途万丈光芒。
    东方的红场，中国人民围绕着它，张灯结彩，火花齐放，欢呼雷动，毛主席万岁！中华人民共和国万岁！从此，我们中国人再也不受别人欺侮压迫了，在地球的东方屹立起来了，一个出席世界民主青年第二次代表大会归国的中国青年在会场里跳跃着说：“我们在世界上多么光荣呵！”坐在天安门左侧的观礼台上的国际友人握着记者的手说：“中华人民共和国成立，是世界和平的重要支柱。”
