Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 3rd: The Shandong Branch of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently issued a decision on strengthening rural work, making decisions on future agricultural production development and land issues. The decision pointed out that some cadres within the Party do not have a sufficient understanding of the new situation of the liberation of the entire Shandong territory, and have not fully estimated the new favorable conditions such as the cessation of war damage in rural areas, the reduction of wartime labor burdens, the demobilization of a large number of militiamen and laborers, and the connection of rural areas with major cities. Therefore, they have failed to fully utilize these favorable conditions to promptly and rapidly shift the focus of work from serving the war to production and construction. The decision pointed out that the primary task of Shandong's economic construction at this stage is to restore and develop agricultural production, improve the lives of farmers, and vigorously provide disaster relief and prepare for famine, in order to overcome disasters, support the national war, and lay a strong foundation for industrial development. In the second half of the year, Shandong's rural work must continue to implement the guiding principle of taking production and disaster relief as the central task. All other work in rural areas must be subordinate to this center; urban industry and commerce should help agricultural production.

The decision pointed out: The current primary tasks of the entire Shandong Province are to complete the four major tasks of autumn harvest, autumn planting, autumn grain tax, and autumn purchase, to do a good job in winter production, to ensure the completion of the annual agricultural production plan, and to prepare for next year's major production. Regarding autumn harvest and autumn planting, it is necessary to ensure timely harvesting and timely cultivation, and to expand the wheat planting area. During the autumn purchase, it is necessary to ensure the completion of the purchase tasks of industrial raw materials such as cotton and peanuts. The autumn grain tax work must implement a reasonable and fair burden policy, and in disaster areas, the policies of reduction and exemption must be correctly grasped.

　　充分发挥新的有利条件
   　山东分局发布决定
   　加强农村工作
    恢复发展农业生产，是全省经济建设首要任务
    当前全省首要工作　秋收秋种秋征秋购
    【新华社济南三日电】中共中央山东分局最近发出关于加强农村工作的决定，对今后发展农业生产、处理土地问题等都作了决定。该决定指出，党内有些干部对山东全境解放的新形势认识不足，没有充分估计农村中战争破坏已经停止，战时劳力负担已经减轻，大批民兵民工已经复员，农村与各大城市已经连成一片等新的有利条件，因此未能充分发挥这些有利条件，及时地迅速地将工作中心从服务战争转向生产建设。决定指出，现阶段山东经济建设的首要任务是恢复和发展农业生产，改善农民生活，大力救灾备荒，以便克服灾患，支援全国战争，并为发展工业打下强有力的基础。下半年山东农村工作必须继续贯彻以生产救灾为中心任务的方针，农村中一切其他工作均必须服从这一中心；城市工业、商业应帮助农业生产。
    决定指出：当前山东全省首要工作是完成秋收、秋种、秋征、秋购四大任务，做好冬季生产工作，保证全年农业生产计划的完成并为明年大生产做好准备工作。关于秋收秋种要保证按时收割，按时耕种，扩大麦田面积。秋购中必须保证完成棉花、花生等工业原料的收购任务。秋征工作要贯彻合理公平负担政策，在灾区要正确掌握减免政策。
