Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 9th - TASS Berlin 8th: The 9th plenary session of the German People's Council held in Berlin on October 7 unanimously adopted the Democratic Germany National Front Manifesto. The manifesto is as follows:

Since the Third German People's Congress issued a letter to the people calling for the establishment of the Democratic Germany National Front, the struggle of the patriotic forces of the German people against the division of Germany and against colonial enslavement in the western occupation zones has developed into a large-scale popular movement.

The national disaster suffered by the German people due to the Western imperialist countries' violation of the Potsdam Agreement has caused the entire German people to rise up and fight for the following lofty goals: to establish a unified, independent, and democratic Germany, to conclude a just peace treaty with Germany as soon as possible, and to withdraw all occupying forces in a short period of time.

It has been four and a half years since the guns fell silent. The German people hoped to maintain economic and political unity, hoped for a democratic and anti-militarist reorganization of Germany and the conclusion of a peace treaty, but these hopes were deceived, all of which were solemnly promised to the German people by the Potsdam Agreement. As a result of the Western countries' imperialist policies, Germany was divided. Germany's economy was deprived of the Ruhr and Saar regions. The German people were refused a peace treaty. On the contrary, occupation statutes that maintain indefinite occupation were imposed on the western occupation zones. The establishment of the Bonn separatist state completed the division of Germany.

The Bonn puppet government can only act in accordance with the orders issued by the Western High Commissioners based on the occupation statutes. The illegal dismantling of factories continues in an attempt to eliminate German competition. The devaluation of the West German mark and the determination of new coal prices once again demonstrate the cruelty of the imperialist occupation policy. The obstruction of the conclusion of trade agreements between East and West Germany once again proves the autocracy of the High Commissioners.

The Bonn separatist government is carrying out the task of incorporating West Germany into the North Atlantic Treaty military group and turning the youth in the separatist state into mercenaries of American imperialism. In order to fulfill this task, German fascism and militarism are openly being restored in West Germany, revanchist ideas are being nurtured, and the first session of the Bonn Parliament has issued a warning signal.

The imperialist policies of division and colonization threaten peace and the existence of the German nation, thereby making it necessary to establish a united front of struggle for all patriotic forces of the German people.

　　民主德国全国阵线宣言
    号召全德人民齐起参加斗争争取建立统一独立民主德国
    【新华社北京九日电】塔斯社柏林八日电：十月七日在柏林举行的德国人民委员会第九届全议，一致通过了民主德国全国阵线宣言。宣言如下：
    自从第三届德国人民代表大会发表告人民书号召成立民主德国全国阵线以来，德国人民爱国力量反对分裂德国、反对西部各占区殖民地奴役的斗争，已经发展成为规模广大的人民运动。
    由于西方帝国主义国家违背波茨坦协定而使德国人民所身受的民族灾难，已使德国全国人民起来为下述崇高目标而斗争：成立统一的独立的民主的德国，尽早缔结公正的对德和约，在短时期内撤退一切占领军。
    自从炮火停息以来已经四年半了。德国人民希望保持经济和政治统一，希望对德国加以民主和反军国主义的改组并缔结和约，但这些希望受到了欺骗，而以上这些都是波茨坦协定对德国人民所庄严许诺的。西方国家帝国主义政策的结果，德国分裂了。德国的经济被剥夺了鲁尔区和萨尔区。德国人民被拒绝得到和约。相反的，保持无限期占领的占领法规却被强加于西方各占区。波恩分立国家的成立，完成了德国的分裂。
    波恩傀儡政府仅仅能遵照西方国家高级专员依据占领法规而颁授的命令行动。非法拆卸工厂仍在继续进行，以图消除德国的竞争。西德马克的贬值和新煤价的厘订，再一次显出了帝国主义占领政策的残酷性。东德与西德之间缔结贸易协定受到阻难，再一次证明了高级专员们的专权。
    波恩分立政府正在执行着使西德加入北大西洋公约军事集团，并将该分立国家中的青年变成美国帝国主义佣兵的任务。为了履行这种任务，德国法西斯主义和军国主义正在西德公开复辟，报复主义思想正在孕育，波恩议会第一届会议已发出了警告的信号。
    帝国主义的分裂政策、殖民政策威胁着和平，威胁着德国国家的存在，从而使德国人民一切爱国力量的斗争的统一战线有成立的必要。
