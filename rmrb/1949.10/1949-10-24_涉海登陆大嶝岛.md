　　Landing on Dadeng Island Across the Sea

On the evening of October 9th, a strong wind and heavy rain lashed the frontline along the coast of southern Fujian. A unit of the People's Liberation Army, according to the scheduled attack plan, still launched a battle to attack Dadeng Island across the sea.

Dadeng Island is one of the many islands surrounding Xiamen, located northwest of Jinmen (Quemoy) and east of Xiamen. Two regiments of the remnant bandits of the 40th Division on the island vainly attempted to stop the advance, holding the island to block the People's Liberation Army's spearhead pointing towards Xiamen.

The commanders and fighters of a unit of the People's Liberation Army, who were tasked with attacking the island, after ten days of intensive military training and active preparations, and with the help of local residents conducted a preliminary probe and actual reconnaissance, learned that at low tide, a beach would appear between the island and the mainland. As long as they walked across the three sand rivers in the center of the beach, they could land on Dadeng Island. In the days leading up to the attack on Dadeng Island, the commanders and fighters actively prepared for the sea crossing assault, practiced attacking forward on the beach day and night, and manufactured a large number of wooden buckets to carry ammunition. To prevent their feet from being pierced, each fighter also specially made a pair of sand-proof shoes.

At 7:00 PM on the 9th, torrential rain poured down along the coast of Dadeng Island. The brave warriors of the People's Liberation Army's assault team, full of fighting spirit, divided into four routes under the cover of dozens of artillery pieces and launched a general attack on the remnant bandits on Dadeng Island, crossing the sea. The assault heroes bravely advanced through the water in the dark night where nothing could be seen. When wading into the first sand river where the water reached their necks, the soldiers, fearing that their weapons would get wet by the seawater, held their weapons above their heads, while others put their weapons in wooden buckets and dragged the buckets forward. After crossing the first sand river, they crossed a stretch of beach. When wading through the second large sand river, the seawater was stirred up by the strong wind, creating rolling waves. Many soldiers were overturned by the wind and waves, but they resolutely fought against the wind and waves and immediately stood up again. If one in front was knocked down by a wave, the one behind would immediately follow up and help him up. Later, they linked their arms tightly together to form a strong whole and continued to bravely advance.

When the assault team had crossed the second sand river and approached Dadeng Island, the remnant bandits on the island finally realized that the main force of the People's Liberation Army had arrived, and they randomly fired shots from the bunkers onto the beach. The brave warriors of the assault team immediately accelerated through the more than one-foot-deep muddy beach, rushed across the third sand river, and crossed more than 400 meters of muddy beach, heading straight for the remnant bandits' beachhead positions. Immediately, shouts of "We have landed on Dadeng Island!" and heroic cries of killing rang out on the beach of Dadeng Island. These sounds and the roar of the wind and rain converged into a deafening roar on the beach, scaring the remnant bandits into abandoning their positions and fleeing. The brave warriors of the assault team quickly broke through the enemy's two barbed wire fences from the east and west sides and rushed into the depths of the bandit garrison on Dadeng Island. A certain company advanced more than three miles on the muddy beach from the beginning of the assault, captured more than two hundred enemy soldiers alive, and occupied the defensive positions held by two battalions of remnant bandits in just thirty minutes. The rapid liberation of Dadeng Island created favorable conditions for landing in Xiamen.

　　涉海登陆大嶝岛
    十月九日晚上，闽南沿海前线狂风暴雨，人民解放军某部仍然按照预定攻击计划，进行了涉海攻击大嶝岛的战斗。
    大嶝岛是厦门外围许多海岛中的一个，位于金门的西北和厦门的东面。岛上残匪四十师的两个团妄图螳臂挡车，困守该岛，以挡架人民解放军指向厦门的矛头。
    担任攻击该岛的人民解放军某部全体指战员，经过十天的军事苦练和积极准备，并在当地居民的帮助下进行了一次敌前试探与实际侦察后，知道落潮的时候，岛与大陆之间，就现出一片海滩，只要徒步从海滩上越过滩中央的三道沙河，就可以登上大嶝岛。指战员们于是在进攻大嶝岛的前几天，就积极赶做涉海攻击的准备工作，日夜在海滩演习攻击前进，并制造大批载送弹药的木桶。为了防止脚被刺破，每个指战员还特别赶做了一双防沙鞋。
    九日下午七点钟，大嶝岛沿海倾盆大雨，人民解放军战志奋发的突击队的勇士们，在数十门大炮掩护之下，分成四路，纵越海水，向大嶝岛残匪发起总攻。突击健儿在伸手不见五指的黑夜里涉水奋勇向前。当涉入水深及颈的第一道沙河时，战士们怕武器被海水浸湿，就把武器举在头顶上，有的则把武器放在木桶里，拖着木桶前进。涉过第一道沙河后又越过一片沙滩。当渡涉第二道大沙河时，海水被狂风掀起了滚滚的波涛，好些战士都给风浪卷起倒在水里，但是他们坚决和风浪搏斗，马上又站起来。前面一个被海浪冲倒了，后面的立刻跟上去把他扶起来。后来他们就几个人手臂紧挽着手臂，结成坚强的整体，继续奋勇前进。
    突击队已经涉过第二道沙河逼近大嶝岛时，岛上的残匪才发觉解放军大军已到，便胡乱地从碉堡里向海滩上发出一阵枪声。突击队的勇士们立刻加速地通过一尺多深地淤泥滩又冲过第三道沙河，再越过了四百余米的淤泥滩，直奔残匪的滩头阵地。大嶝岛海滩上立刻响起“我们登上大嶝岛了！”的欢呼声和雄壮的喊杀声，这些声音和风雨的咆哮声在沙滩上汇成巨响，把残匪吓得一个个脱阵而逃。突击队的勇士们很快地便从东西两面突破匪军两道铁丝网，直扑大嶝岛上守匪的纵深。某连从冲锋开始在淤泥滩上前进三里多路，活捉二百多匪军，到占领有两个营残匪据守的防御阵地，只花了三十分钟时间。大嶝岛的迅速解放，为登陆厦门造成了便利的条件。
