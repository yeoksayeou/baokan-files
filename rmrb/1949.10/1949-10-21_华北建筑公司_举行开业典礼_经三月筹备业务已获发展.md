North China Construction Company
　Holds Opening Ceremony
　Business Development Achieved After Three Months of Preparation

[This newspaper dispatch] The state-owned North China Construction Company was formally established in Beijing yesterday (the 20th) and held an opening ceremony. At the meeting, Zhang Wen'ang, Minister of the Communications Department of the North China People's Government, called on engineers, technicians, and all construction workers to study hard, absorb various construction experiences, follow the mass line, integrate with practice, conduct research and improvements, and take on the construction tasks of the new China. In addition, the conference also listened to the work reports of Manager Cao Chengzong and Deputy Manager Liu Hong regarding the preparatory period of the North China Construction Company. According to the company, since July of this year, it has been ordered by the North China Highway Transportation General Bureau to carry out preparations on the one hand and develop business on the other, in order to learn from experience. At that time, the General Bureau transferred a total of 36 cadres in administration, technology, and management, 50 construction workers, and funds equivalent to 150,000 catties of millet. First, the business policy was determined as: internally relying on the working class and giving full play to the wisdom of technical personnel; externally striving for low cost and reasonable construction. Then, iron and wood factories and brick factories were established, and surveying, design, construction supervision, renovation, and repair of various construction projects were contracted. Through the efforts of all employees for three and a half months, great progress has been made. The designed, supervised, or contracted projects include the erection of the Beihe Bridge on the Beijing-Hankou Railway and the construction of culverts, and the repair of various factory buildings. It also completed the task of transporting 7,350 metric tons of various building materials from Beijing-Tianjin or brick, tile, and lime producing areas to construction areas. The iron and wood factory has been expanded and renovated, and it is expected to be able to fully undertake the welding, riveting, casting, hardware, iron materials, house frames, bridge frames, furniture, and wood processing required for construction projects within half a year. A brick kiln was purchased, which can produce more than 25,000 bricks per day. In terms of personnel, the number of staff has expanded from 30 to 74, and the number of construction workers, including temporary workers, has reached more than 600. Twenty-three cadres in various fields, such as administration, management, supervision, and leading workers, have been promoted and trained from the workers, forming the backbone of the company leading the workers. However, the main shortcomings in this period are: not knowing how to do business and being impatient to deal with manufacturers; not conducting good selection and comparison when buying materials. The business department lacks good planning, the organization is not strict, and the procedures are disorganized, which should be improved in the future.

　　华北建筑公司
  　举行开业典礼
  　经三月筹备业务已获发展
    【本报讯】国营华北建筑公司于昨日（二十日）在北京正式成立，并举行开业典礼。会上华北人民政府交通部张文昂部长号召工程师、技师和全体建筑工人好好学习，吸取各种建筑经验，走群众路线，和实际结合，进行研究改进，负起新中国的建筑任务。此外，大会并听取了曹承宗经理和刘泓副经理关于华北建筑公司筹备期间的工作报告。按该公司自今年七月份起，即奉华北公路运输总局之命，一面进行筹备，一面开展业务，以便从中吸取经验。当时由总局共抽调行政、技术、管理等各种干部三十六人，建筑工人五十名，资金合小米十五万斤。首先确定了经营方针为：对内依靠工人阶级，发挥技术人材的智慧；对外力求造价低廉，建筑合理。接着即建立铁木工厂、砖厂、承揽各项建筑工程之测绘、设计、施工监造、及改建修缮等业务。经全体职工三个半月的努力，已获得了大的进展。设计监造或承办的工程有京汉线北河大桥的架设，涵洞的建筑，各种厂房的修缮等。并完成了由京津或砖瓦石灰产地运送至施工地区各种建筑材料七千三百五十公吨的任务。扩大并整顿了铁木工厂，预计半年内能够完全担负建筑工程上所需要的焊、铆、熔铸、以及五金铁料、房架、桥架、家具，木材加工等。购买砖窑一处，每日可出砖二万五千余块。在人员方面，由三十个工作人员扩大到七十四人，建筑工人连同临时工计算在内，已到达六百余人，并从工人中提拔培养出事务、管理、监工、领工等各种干部二十三人，形成公司领导工人的骨干。但在这一段的主要缺点是：不会做生意，不耐烦与厂商来往；买材料有时没有很好的进行选择比较。业务部门缺乏很好的计划，组织不严密，办事手续零乱，今后应力求改进。
