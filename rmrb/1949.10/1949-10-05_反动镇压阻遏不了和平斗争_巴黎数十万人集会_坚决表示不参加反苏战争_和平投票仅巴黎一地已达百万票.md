Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 4th: TASS Moscow dispatch: Today, the *Pravda* published a correspondent's article by Zhukov, describing the grand peace conference held in Paris on October 2nd.

Zhukov said that the reactionaries are doing everything possible to obstruct the French people from holding peace days and banning peace votes. The police barbarously searched ballot boxes and peace ballots, unreasonably dismissed mayors who dared to participate in peace votes, and brutally suppressed the mothers of soldiers who asked the Minister of the Army to stop the invasion of the Vietnamese people. The organizers and instigators of these actions attempted to intimidate the French working people and weaken their struggle against the warmongers. But what was the result? It only exposed themselves and strengthened the people's will to engage in this struggle.

That is why hundreds of thousands of people in Paris and its suburbs participated in the conference held at the Place de la Porte de Versailles. A huge, symbolic ballot box, seven meters high, attracted general attention. Representatives of the Associations of Fighters for Peace and Freedom in various districts poured hundreds of thousands of votes supporting peace, filled out by citizens of various districts of Paris and collected despite the terror of the police, into this ballot box.

Lately, crude acts, which Parisians are accustomed to, have occurred from time to time at the entrances of parks, namely, police teams attacked peace delegations arriving one after another, attempting to seize the cards demanding peace from their hands. However, it is clear that these attacks could not affect the Day of Peace. When the leader of the Association of Fighters for Peace and Freedom, former Minister Fache, took the podium and announced the opening of the conference, he was greeted with stormy cheers. Representatives from all walks of life took the stage to speak one after another, proving the unity in the struggle for peace.

When speakers firmly declared that the French people would never participate in an anti-Soviet war, particularly enthusiastic cheers erupted. When some speakers, especially General Confederation of Labor Secretary Mou Mou Se and French Communist Party representative Casanova, talked about the traitor Tito's betrayal role (Tito and his gang have already taken refuge in the imperialist camp and are now acting as lackeys of the American warmongers), the attendees spat on this despicable traitor.

Anna Sreich, a representative of the Czechoslovak Women's Committee who came to Paris from Prague, was warmly applauded when she addressed the conference. Sreich read a letter from the Czechoslovak Women's International Peace Day to the French women. When she read the request for women around the world to unite and fight to defend peace, the whole audience erupted in cheers again.

In a generally enthusiastic atmosphere, Fache announced: According to preliminary statistics, the number of peace votes received in Paris alone exceeds one million! Voting is still in progress. Many other cities throughout France also held mass rallies to commemorate International Peace Day.

　　反动镇压阻遏不了和平斗争
    巴黎数十万人集会
    坚决表示不参加反苏战争
    和平投票仅巴黎一地已达百万票
    【新华社北京四日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报今天刊载该报记者朱可夫的通讯，描述十月二日在巴黎举行的盛大的和平大会的情况。
    朱可夫说，反动派尽一切可能阻挠法国人民的举行和平日，禁止和平投票。警察野蛮地搜索投票箱与和平票，无理撤除敢于参加和平投票的市长们的职务，粗暴镇压向陆军部长要求停止侵略越南人民的士兵们的母亲。这些行动的组织者与鼓动者企图恫吓法国劳动人民，削弱他们反对战争贩子的斗争。但结果怎样呢？只不过揭露了他们自己，反而加强了人民从事这一斗争的意志。
    这就是为什么巴黎各地及近郊数十万人民要参加在凡尔赛门大广场举行的大会。巨大的高达七公尺的象征性的投票箱，吸引了普遍的注意，各地区争取和平与自由战士协会理事会的代表把巴黎各地区市民所填写的及不顾警察的恐怖而收集来的数十万拥护和平的票，投入这个票箱。
    近来在公园的入口处不时发生对巴黎人已司空见惯的粗野举动，即警察队袭击先后到达的和平代表团，企图夺走他们手中要求和平的卡片。但是，很明显的，这些袭击决不能影响和平日。当争取和平与自由战士协会的领袖前部长法奇登上讲坛宣布大会开幕时，受到了暴风雨般的欢呼。各不同阶层人民的代表都相继登台发言，证明在争取和平的斗争中的团结一致。
    当演说者坚决宣称法国人民决不参加反苏战争时，爆发了特别热烈的欢呼。某些演说者，特别是总工会书记摩毛色及法共代表卡桑诺伐谈到叛徒铁托的背叛角色（铁托已与他一帮人投靠帝国主义阵营，现在正充作美国战争贩子的奴婢）时，与会者无不唾弃这一卑贱的叛徒。
    自布拉格赶来巴黎的捷克斯洛伐克妇女委员会代表安娜·斯莱奇向大会致词时受到热烈的欢呼。斯莱奇宣读捷克斯洛伐克妇女国际和平日致法国妇女信。当他读到要求全世界妇女团结起来进行保卫和平的斗争时，全场又爆发了欢呼。
    法奇于普遍热烈的情绪中宣布：收到的和平投票据初步统计，仅在巴黎一地就有一百多万票！投票仍在继续中。全法国其他许多城市也都举行群众大会纪念国际和平日。
