My Impressions of Participating in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Zhu Xuefan

From September 21st to 30th of last month, the epoch-making Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference was held in Beijing, the capital of China. At this historic meeting, the founding of the People's Republic of China was announced, and the Central People's Government was established. As a representative of the working class, I attended this meeting and participated in the discussion of national construction plans. This honor was bestowed upon me by the national working class. After attending this meeting, I have the following reflections:

My first impression is that the working class has received unprecedented respect, and the Chinese working class has stood in the position of the leading class. The attainment of this position is the result of the working class, under the strong leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, uniting the people of the whole country, and undergoing more than 20 years of arduous struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. In this revolutionary struggle, the working class was able to stand at the forefront and become the main force of the people's revolution because it had its own vanguard—the Chinese Communist Party, and because it had its own wise leader—Chairman Mao.

In the past, the Chinese working class suffered the heaviest exploitation and the greatest oppression. Their lives were like those of cattle and horses. Their hard work only benefited a few oppressors. They were not only unable to eat their fill and keep warm, but also subjected to cruel suppression and massacre. Under the Kuomintang reactionaries' more than 20 years of fascist rule, the lives of workers were a history of struggle filled with blood and tears. Thousands upon thousands of outstanding workers were sacrificed under the guns and bayonets of the reactionaries. For example, in February 1947, workers at the Shanghai Shenxin No. 9 Factory, unable to obtain their year-end bonus, had no choice but to go on strike. The reactionaries dispatched military police and secret agents, killing more than a hundred workers on the spot. In the Kuomintang-controlled areas, one bloodbath followed another, and the blood of worker brothers stained the land of Shanghai, Wuhan, Chongqing, and other major cities.

However, the Chinese working class, under the victorious banner of Chairman Mao, never succumbed. They followed the footsteps of the martyrs, bandaged their wounds, got up, and continued to struggle forward. Today, the Chinese working class has finally stood up, transforming from the slaves of yesterday to the masters of today. As young female worker Fan Xiaofeng said: "I am a young female worker... For seventeen years, I worked in the British Ewo Cotton Mill, the Japanese Naigai Cotton Mill, and the Kuomintang bureaucratic capital's China Textile Factory No. 1, living a life of hunger and cold like a beast of burden." She continued: "Today, I—a young female worker—can stand on the podium of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to speak. This is something that has never happened in the five thousand years of Chinese history."

My second impression is that this People's Political Consultative Conference truly united the people of the whole country. It included representatives from the Chinese Communist Party, various democratic parties, people's organizations, various regions, the People's Liberation Army, various ethnic minorities, overseas Chinese, and other patriotic democratic individuals. This revolutionary unity of the Chinese people is the first of its kind in Chinese history. Imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries tried every possible means to undermine the great unity of the Chinese people, but now they have been completely defeated. As Chairman Mao has instructed us: As long as we unite the people of the whole country and international friends, we will be able to defeat any conspiracy to infringe upon the Chinese people.

My third impression is that this People's Political Consultative Conference promoted a high degree of democratic spirit. We are practicing new democracy, true democracy, which is fundamentally different from the old democracy and false democracy of capitalism. In this conference, since there are representatives of various classes, there will naturally be different opinions. However, after repeated discussions of many issues, combining various perspectives, and conducting research and exploration, a common and unified opinion was reached through agreement. Important bills in the conference, such as the Organizational Law of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and the Organizational Law of the Central People's Government, were all unanimously approved by the entire assembly.

My fourth impression is that implementing the people's democratic dictatorship is the most important weapon in the hands of our national workers and the people of the whole country. By being democratic towards the people and dictatorial towards the reactionaries, we will be able to suppress the conspiracies of imperialism and its running dogs, the reactionaries, and consolidate our victorious achievements.

Now that our working class has a lofty position and has become the leading class of the state power, we must embrace a responsible attitude as masters of the country, follow Chairman Mao's instructions, strive to improve production, learn well from the Soviet Union, and transform the backward agricultural China into a progressive industrial China. The worker brothers in the to-be-liberated areas must gather strength, persist in struggle, protect industrial and mining equipment, prevent sabotage by the reactionaries, and welcome the People's Liberation Army. We have firm confidence, we have great strength, and victory will surely belong to us.

### 我参加人民政协的感想

　　我参加人民政协的感想
    中华全国总工会副主席  朱学范
    在上月二十一日到三十日，在中国人民首都北京，举行了划时代的中国人民政治协商会议，在这个历史性的会议上，宣布成立了中华人民共和国，产生了中央人民政府。我以工人代表的身分，出席了这个会议，参与讨论建国大计，这光荣是全国工人阶级给我的。参加这个会议以后，我有下面几点感想：
    我的第一个感想是工人阶级受到空前未有的尊重，中国工人阶级已站在领导阶级的地位。这种地位的获得，是工人阶级，在中国共产党的坚强领导下，团结了全国人民，经过了二十多年反帝、反封建、反官僚资本的艰苦斗争的结果。在这革命斗争中，工人阶级因为有了自己的先锋队——中国共产党，因为有了自己的英明的领袖——毛主席，才能够站在最前列，才能够成为人民革命的主力军。
    在过去，中国工人阶级受的剥削最重，受的压迫最大。他们的生活象牛马一样。他们辛苦劳动，只是给少数压迫者享受。他们非但吃不饱，穿不暖，而且还受到残酷的镇压和屠杀。在国民党反动派二十多年的法西斯统治下，工人的生活，就是一部充满了血泪的斗争史。成千成万的优秀工人，被牺牲在反动派的枪口刺刀下面。比如一九四七年二月上海申新九厂工人，因为要求年赏，不得已举行罢工，反动派就出动军警特务，当场杀死一百多工人。在国民党统治区，血案一个接着一个，工人兄弟的鲜血染红了上海、武汉、重庆等大城市的土地。
    但是，中国工人阶级在毛主席胜利旗帜下永远不屈服的。他们踏着先烈的血迹，裹好身上的创伤，爬起来，继续奋斗前进。到今天，中国工人阶级终于翻身了，由昨天的奴隶变为今天的主人。象青年女工范小凤同志说的：“我是一个青年女工……十七年来，先后在英国怡和纱厂，日本内外棉纱厂，国民党官僚资本中纺一厂做工，象牛马一样，过着捱饥受冻的生活。”她继续说：“今天我——一个年青的女工，能够站在中国人民政治协商会议的讲台上来说话，这是五千年来中国历史上没有的事。”
    我的第二个感想是这次人民政协，真正团结了全国人民，这里有中国共产党，各民主党派，人民团体，各地区，人民解放军，各少数民族，国外华侨及其他爱国民主分子的代表。这种中国人民的革命大团结，是中国有史以来的第一次。帝国主义和国民党反动派曾经千方百计的要破坏中国人民的大团结，现在它们终于是彻底的失败了。诚如毛主席所指示我们的：只要我们团结全国人民和国际友人，我们就能够打败任何侵害中国人民的阴谋。
    我的第三个感想是这次人民政协，发扬了高度的民主精神。我们实行的是新民主、真民主，这与资本主义的旧民主，假民主有着本质的区别。这次会议中，既然有各种阶级的代表，当然会有不同的意见，但是许多问题经过再三再四的反复讨论，综合各方面的看法，加以研究探讨，然后协议出共同一致的意见来。会议中的重要法案，象中国人民政治协商会议组织法，中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领，中央人民政府组织法，都是在大会上经过全体一致通过的。
    我的第四个感想是实行人民民主专政，是我们全国工人，全国人民手中的最重要的武器。对人民民主，对反动派专政，这样做，我们就能够压制帝国主义及其走狗反动派的阴谋活动，巩固我们的胜利果实。
    现在我们工人阶级已有了崇高的地位，已成为国家政权的领导阶级，我们就要抱着国家主人翁的负责态度，遵照毛主席的指示，努力提高生产，好好的向苏联学习，把落后的农业的中国，转变成为进步的工业的中国。在待解放区的工人弟兄，更要积聚力量，坚持斗争，保护工矿设备，防止反动派的破坏，迎接人民解放军。我们有坚强的信心，我们有伟大的力量，胜利一定是属于我们的。
