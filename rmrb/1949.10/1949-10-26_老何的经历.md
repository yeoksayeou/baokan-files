Old He is a very clever person, and has some ability, but his vision is too high. He always thinks the pond is too small and the conditions are too low for him to use his talents. Therefore, his set of skills is like a burden, always on his back. He is unwilling to sell it himself, and the masses have no way to buy it. Trouble follows him all day long.

One sunny afternoon, Old He ran in from outside with a face full of joy, as happy as a frustrated hunter who suddenly catches a beast. Everyone was used to his gloomy face, and they were all surprised by his sudden joy.

"Old He! What's the good news? Why are you so happy?" everyone asked in unison.

"The higher-ups have ordered us to be transferred to Beijing," he said, and then applauded himself for a while.

He heard this from the political commissar, so the news must be accurate.

The hope of being transferred and changing his place of residence was a very important issue in Old He's mind. Today he heard the news of going to Beijing, so he was so energetic. That night, Old He was so excited that he couldn't sleep. High-rise buildings, electric lights, cement roads, and how he would show off his skills when he got there… a series of beautiful scenes kept playing in his mind.

He once told everyone: "This time when I get to Beijing, I must work hard and reorganize our business."

As long as it is beneficial to the work, everyone is willing for him to do so.

In a few days, our team left that remote mountain city and set off on the road to Beijing. Old He was very active in arranging straw and getting hot water for everyone on the march, and he kept smiling.

That evening, through a layer of thin mist, the walls of Beijing could be seen in the distance. The comrades quickened their pace, wanting to rush into the city to admire the scenery of this long-admired cultural capital. At this time, our advance team was already waiting for the team at the village entrance by the roadside. This indicated that we were going to camp here.

The advance comrades led the team into a large temple in the village, which was said to be the place designated by the higher-ups for us to station. Stepping into the temple gate, the courtyard was full of weeds, which looked very desolate. Then, the rooms were assigned, and inside were three hideous statues. Moreover, in order to abide by military discipline, it was not allowed to enter the city casually. This news poured cold water on Old He's ardent hopes.

The long march was successfully completed. The comrades were all in a victorious mood, cleaning the house, arranging the straw, and unpacking their bags… busy as a group. Old He stood alone in the courtyard, his eyes fixed on a stone tablet in front of the door, his mouth bulging enough to tie a donkey. Comrade Wang asked him to go in and rest, but he didn't answer, his eyes still fixed on the stone tablet in front of the door, his mouth still bulging so high. The comrades knew what was on his mind and didn't say much to him. They opened his backpack and arranged for him to rest.

From then on, depression reappeared on his face.

We lived in the suburbs of Beijing, which was not as perfect as Old He had imagined, but it was much more convenient than the working conditions in the mountain沟. For example, we first made two new sets of scenery, bought some lighting equipment, and added a lot of makeup supplies. To be honest, this was already a fairly wealthy troupe. The comrades were very satisfied and all planned for Old He to "work hard."

The reality was not like this. Those new working conditions did not arouse Old He's interest at all.

He said to the comrades: "The conditions of this drama club and that cultural troupe in Beijing are stronger than ours! How can we sell this set of ours in Beijing! Ridiculous!"

As the days passed, Old He's troubles grew with the days. He couldn't join the groups he admired, and he always felt that the environment in front of him was not pleasing to the eye. He felt that Beijing was not a place for him to be a hero. The only way was to request a transfer.

This time, his request for a transfer was lowered. He didn't want to go to a better place anymore, because better places would not show his talent even more, so he planned to go to a remote place to "strengthen himself."

The higher-ups always try to take care of the comrades' wishes as much as possible without violating organizational principles. Coincidentally, a certain unit in the Northwest needed literary and artistic cadres, so the higher-ups introduced Old He to the Northwest. Old He accepted this transfer, hoping to leave this group he had long wanted to leave immediately.

The day he left, the wind was blowing. The comrades sent him to the station. He assured everyone: "This time when I get to the Northwest, I must work hard." He felt proud, thinking that he should be a hero for going to work in the difficult Northwest. The comrades also admired his determination to fight against hardship and wished him success in his plan.

Old He's "ideals" were exceptionally rich. Along the way, he imagined his destination to be very beautiful: vast deserts, boundless grasslands, herds of livestock, yurts… he riding a bridleless horse, galloping in the wind and sand. How wonderful and magnificent this is! "When I get there, the comrades will definitely go to the station to pick me up. The first impression I give others must not be careless. My attitude must be very serious. At the welcome meeting, I should give a good report to everyone on my aspirations and skills, so that they will admire me. There are not many talents there, wouldn't I be one of the best when I go! There will be no problem with me being in charge of the work…"

The more Old He thought about it, the happier he became, and he forgot about the loneliness of the journey.

He arrived at his destination. He saw the surrounding mountains from the car window, knowing that there was no desert here and no yurts, which immediately diminished the color of Old He's beautiful imagination.

The passengers who got off the train had all left, and he still couldn't see the person who was coming to pick him up. Old He was anxiously looking around when a traffic policeman came over and urged him to leave the station. He had to pick up his luggage in frustration, ask for directions, and look for his new job post. As he walked, he complained that the comrades here were too unenthusiastic.

The cultural troupe was found, but another unsatisfactory thing made friends with him again. It turned out that the comrades here had all gone to work in the countryside, and it was even more coincidental that the cultural troupe here also lived in a large temple. A cook comrade who stayed behind arranged a bunk for him in the side hall and made him noodles (the main food here, which he was not used to eating at first) for dinner. The cook comrade also introduced to him: we eat this stuff most of the year here. At this time, all the beautiful scenery in his mind was blown away by the cold wind blowing in from the window holes. All that existed in front of him was annoyance. He began to regret it: "Why did I have to leave Beijing?"

With great difficulty, he waited for three days before the cultural troupe team returned. The comrades asked him questions and cared about his life, and they were indeed very welcoming to him; but in his eyes, these comrades were all a bunch of "country bumpkins." He also put on a full show in front of the comrades.

The instructor was too busy to talk to him in detail, and he criticized the instructor for being too cold to the comrades. He said to the comrades: "Our political commissar in Beijing is really concerned about the comrades. Once when I was sick, he went to see me several times a day." Old He unprecedentedly expressed his goodwill towards the political commissar.

In the evening, the cultural troupe held a symposium in the regimental headquarters, which was specifically held to welcome Old He.

At the meeting, Regiment Leader Li first gave a brief introduction to the history of this cultural troupe. He particularly pointed out that this cultural troupe grew up in a hard struggle. Regiment Leader Li called on everyone to carry forward this glorious tradition of hard struggle. He also said:

"A revolutionary worker should pay attention to work achievements and not be greedy for status." As he spoke, he pointed to the statues in the main hall. "This pile of mud occupies a considerable position, but once the masses are awakened, they will be pulled down from the throne…."

After Regiment Leader Li finished speaking, Old He's face turned red. The large report he had prepared to show himself had no courage to say it again. He reluctantly finished the meeting and silently crawled into bed.

The lessons of reality and Regiment Leader Li's talk moved Old He. He began to reflect on his past: big vision, being ambitious, always thinking that the other mountain is higher than this one, etc., were all wrong ideas. He began to realize that a revolutionary should be down-to-earth, work hard, give up personal fantasies, and work hard for the entire revolutionary cause. He was determined to change.

He didn't even eat breakfast the next day. The instructor went to see him, and he said shamefully: "It's okay! I caught a bit of a cold."

From then on, Old He's style really began to change. He became enthusiastic about learning and active in work. He began to be with the masses, and the masses gradually liked to approach him.

He often said to the comrades:

"Whoever is dissatisfied with the current environment, the new environment will also make him dissatisfied. The question is whether he can transform the environment and transform himself at the same time."

    老何的经历
    戴宗彝 
    老何是个很聪明的人，也有点儿本事，就是眼眶子太大，总看着塘子小，条件低，不是他用武之地，本事没法施展。因此，他那一套本事，就如同一个包袱，一直就那么背着，自己既不愿卖，群众也没法买，苦恼一天到晚紧紧跟着他。
    一个晴天的下午，老何满脸喜色，从外面跑进来，象个不如意的猎夫忽然得到了一只野兽似的那么高兴。他一张终日郁闷的脸，大家看得惯了，这时对他这种突如其来的高兴，都很惊异。
    “老何！什么喜事？这么高兴？”大家一口同声的问。
    “上级的命令，调咱们到北京。”他说着自己又鼓了一阵子掌。
    听说这是政委给他说的，消息是不会错。
    希望调动和转移驻地，是老何全部思想中占着重要位置的问题，今天他打听得去北京的消息，所以劲头那么大。这天晚上，老何兴奋得觉也睡不着。楼房、电灯、洋灰马路，以及自己到了那里，要如何地露上一手……一连串美好的景象，不停地在脑子里演映。
    他曾经向大家表示：“这回到了北京，一定要好好工作一番，把咱们的业务重新整顿整顿。”
    只要对工作有利，大家愿意他能够这么做。
    不多几天，我们的队伍离开那座偏僻的山城，往北京的道上出发了。老何在在行军的路上，替大家搞铺草、弄开水，倒很积极，嘴边也不断挂着笑意。
    这天黄昏，远远透过一层薄雾，就可以望见北京的城墙了。同志们加快了步子，想赶进城去，瞻仰这座久已神往的文化古都的风光。这时，我们的前站人员，已经在路旁的村头等队伍了。这说明我们要在这里宿营。
    前站同志把队伍引进村里的一所大庙，据说这是上级指定我们驻扎的地方。踏进庙门，满院子的蔓草，显得十分荒凉，接着分配寝室，里面是三尊面目狰狞的塑像。并且为了遵守军纪，不准随便进城。这个消息，对老何的热切的希望泼了一盆冷水。
    长途的行军任务，顺利完成了。同志们都怀着胜利的心情，打扫屋子、弄铺草、解背包……忙做一团。老何独自立在院里，两只眼睛死死钉住门前的一块石碑，嘴巴鼓得可以拴条叫驴。王同志叫他进去休息，他没有答理，眼睛还是钉住门前的石碑，嘴依然鼓得那么高。同志们知道他的心事，没和他多说，大家给他打开背包，就安顿他休息了。
    从此，郁闷重新罩上了他的面庞。
    我们住在北京的郊外，虽不如老何想的那么美满，但是比起在山沟里的工作条件来，是要便利得多了。比如我们首先就做了两套新景片，买了一部分灯光器材，添制了不少的化装用品。说真话，这已经是一个够阔气的剧团了。同志们很满意，都打算老何“一定要好好工作一番。”
    事实并不这样。那些新的工作条件，一概引不起老何的兴趣。
    他对同志们说：“北京的这个剧社，那个文工团，谁不比咱们的条件强！咱们这一套，还想在北京来卖！见鬼！”
    日子一天天过去，老何的苦恼，跟着日子的增长，愈来愈发展。自己羡慕的团体不能去参加，对于眼前的环境总觉着不顺眼，觉得北京也不是他称英雄的地方，唯一的办法是请求调动。
    这次他对于调动的要求是降低了，他不想再到好的地方去，因为好的地方更显露不了他的头角，所以他打算到一个偏远的地方，把自己“锻炼得坚强一些”。
    上级对同志们的志愿，在不违反组织的原则下，总是尽量去照顾。恰巧西北某部需要文艺干部，上级就把老何介绍到西北去。老何接受了这个调遣，盼望立刻离开这个久已不想留下去的团体。
    他走的那天，刮着大风，同志们送他到车站，他向大家保证：“这次到了西北，一定要好好工作一番。”他感觉得骄傲，以为自己到艰苦的西北去工作，应该是英雄。同志们也很钦佩他准备和艰苦斗争的决心，都预祝他的计划胜利实现。
    老何的“理想”是丰富不过的，一路上对他的去处，想得十分美丽：大沙漠、无边的草原、牲畜群、蒙古包………自己骑着无缰的大马，在风沙里奔驰。这是多么美妙和雄伟呀！“到了那里，同志们一定会到车站去接我，给别人的第一个印象，可不能马虎。自己的态度一定要放得很严肃。在欢迎会上，我应该把自己的抱负和技术向大家作一个很好的报告，好让他们佩服我。那里的人才不多，我去了还不是数一数二的人物！工作听自己支配那是绝无问题的事…………。”
    老何越想越高兴，也就忘记旅途的寂寞。
    到达目的地了。他从车窗里望见四面的山峰，知到这里并没有沙漠，也看不见蒙古包，这对老何的美丽的想象，立刻就减了颜色。
    下车的客人走完了，还看不见来接他的人。老何正在发急的张望，对面走过来一个路警催他出站。他只好懊丧地提起行李，问明路径，向他新的工作岗位找去。一面走一面埋怨这里的同志太没有热情。
    文工团是找到了，可是另一个不如意的事，又和他做了朋友。原来这里的同志都下乡工作去了，更凑巧的是这里的文工团也住的是一所大庙。一位留守的炊事员同志在偏殿里替他安好铺位，晚饭给他做的莜面（此地的主要粮食，初食很不习惯）。炊事员同志又向他介绍：这里终年多半是吃的这个东西。此时他一脑子的美景，都被窗洞里吹进来的冷风给刮跑了。眼前存在的只有烦恼。他开始后悔了：“为什么偏要离开北京呢？”
    好容易，他等了三天，文工团的队伍才回来。同志们见了他问长问短，关照他的生活，的确对他很欢迎；但从他的眼里看这些同志，都是一群“土豹子”。他在同志们面前的派头也就摆得十足。
    指导员因为很忙，没顾得和他细谈，他批评指导员对同志太冷淡。他对同志们说：“我们北京的政委对同志真关心，有一次我生病，他一天去看我几次。”老何破天荒地对政委表示好感。
    晚上，文工团在团部里举行了一个座谈会，这是专为欢迎老何而开的。
    在会上，李团长首先把这个文工团的历史简单地作了介绍。他特别指出这个文工团是在坚苦斗争中成长起来的。李团长号召大家发扬这种坚苦奋斗的光荣传统。他还说：
    “一个革命工作者，要注重工作成绩，不要贪图地位。”他说着用手指向大殿上的神像。“这一堆泥土，占的地位着实不小，但是群众一旦觉悟了，就要把它从宝座上拔下来……。”
    李团长说完了话，老何的脸红了，老早准备下的一大篇表现自己的报告，没有勇气再说出来，勉强硬着头皮把会开完，一声不响钻进被窝。
    事实的教训和李团长的谈话，感动了老何。他开始对自己的过去作了反省：眼眶子大、好高鹜远、这山望着那山高等等思想，都是错误的。他开始认识到一个革命者，应该脚踏实地，坚苦奋斗，放弃个人的幻想，为整个革命事业去努力。他决心转变。
    第二天早饭也没吃，指导员去看他，他惭愧的说：“不要紧！受了点感冒。”
    从此以后，老何的作风的确开始变了。他对学习热心了，对工作积极了。他开始和群众在一起，群众也渐渐喜欢接近他。
    他常对同志们说：
    “谁对现实的环境感到不满，那么新的环境也会使他不如意，问题在于自己能不能去改造环境同时也改造自己。”
