Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 8th. London dispatch: Increasingly, evidence demonstrates the serious harm caused by the devaluation of the pound sterling to the economic lives of the British people. The wholesale price index published by "The Economist" magazine on September 27 shows a sharp rise in prices after the devaluation. The index has risen from 165.6 before the devaluation to 172.5, an increase of 4.1 percent. Among them, the price of grains and meat increased by 5.1 percent, textiles increased by 6.6 percent, and the price of exported metals and minerals increased by a staggering 36.9 percent. New price increases are threatening the British people again. British newspapers prominently published news from Buenos Aires stating that Argentina will demand a 40 percent increase in the price of meat supplied to Britain under the Anglo-Argentine agreement. A "Worker's Daily" reporter stated that because the British government will refuse to increase food subsidies, this may mean a reduction in already meager meat rations. A 40 percent price increase would mean the price of meat would increase from 10.5 pence per pound to 1 shilling 2.5 pence.

Mr. Hallam, Chairman of Morley Ltd., stated that the price reductions for daily necessities, cotton and woolen piece goods, and household linens, originally scheduled to take effect on September 26, have been offset by the devaluation of the pound. People still remember that right-wing trade union leaders touted the price reductions of these commodities as evidence of the government's determination to lower prices. Mr. Hallam stated that in the United States, the price of cotton has increased by 5 pence per pound, while in Egypt it has increased by 2 pence, and wool prices are also trending higher. When existing stocks are depleted, raw materials will have to be purchased at new prices, and the cost of British textiles will soon rise accordingly.

The British Medical Journal announced on September 22 that, due to the devaluation, the expenses of the British National Health Service will also increase due to the high price of medicines imported from the United States.

According to the "Worker's Daily," mass meetings held in front of many factories in London show growing anger at this new attack on wages.

On September 23, the Glasgow Trades Council called on the Scottish Trades Union Congress to use its influence to "reverse the tragic consequences of the devaluation of the pound." The council passed a resolution urging the Scottish Trades Union Congress to urge the government to develop trade agreements with non-dollar areas and to pursue policies to stop freezing wages, reduce prices, and reduce profits.

　　英镑贬值后物价剧烈上涨
    英国人民愤怒抗议
    【新华社北京八日电】伦敦讯，愈来愈多的证据证明，英镑贬值对于英国人民经济生活的严重危害。“经济学家”杂志发表的九月二十七日批发物价指数，表明物价在贬值后剧烈上涨，该项指数已由贬值前的一百六十五点六上升至一百七十二点五，增加达百分之四点一。其中谷物与肉类价格上涨了百分之五点一，纺织品上涨了百分之六点六，而出口的金属与矿物的价格竟上涨达百分之三十六点九。新的涨价又在威胁着英国人民。英国报纸以显著地位刊载来自布宜诺斯艾利斯的消息，说阿根廷将要求把按照英阿协定供给英国的肉类价格增加百分之四十。工人日报记者称，因为英国政府将拒绝增加食粮补贴费，这可能意味着减少已经少得可怜的肉类的配给。加价百分之四十，将意味着肉类价格将自每镑十辨士半增加到一先令二辨士半。
    摩莱有限公司董事长贺拉姆比称，原定于九月二十六日起，实行的日用品、棉毛匹头和家用麻布的减价，已为金镑的贬值所抵消。人们还记得，右翼工会领袖曾把这些商品的减价大肆宣传为政府决心减低物价的证据。贺氏称，在美国，棉花价格每镑已增加了五辨士，而在埃及则增加了两辨士，羊毛价格亦趋高涨。当现有的存货用完时，只好以新的价格购买原料，英国纺织品的成本即将随之上涨。
    英国医学杂志九月二十二日宣称，由于贬值，英国国家卫生机关的费用，也将因自美国输入的药品价格的高昂而增加。
    据工人日报报道，伦敦许多工厂门前所举行的群众会议，表明了对这个对工资新进攻的日增的愤怒。
    格拉斯哥工会委员会九月二十三日呼吁苏格兰职工大会利用它的影响，来“挽回英镑贬值的悲剧性后果”。该委员会通过了一项决议，要求苏格兰职工大会敦促政府发展和非美元区的贸易协定，并奉行停止冻结工资、减低物价和利润等政策。
