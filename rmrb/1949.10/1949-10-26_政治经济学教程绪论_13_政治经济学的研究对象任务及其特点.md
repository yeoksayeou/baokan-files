    Chapter One Production Mode
    Section Three: The Unity of Productive Forces and Production Relations—The Mode of Production

    Production relations that promote the development of productive forces are also a kind of productive force.

    When new production relations promote the development of productive forces, these new production relations themselves become a kind of productive force. For example, in the new democratic society, after the land reform, peasants have land, cattle, farm implements, and other means of production, and the exploitation by landlords is abolished, giving peasants the necessary production conditions and enhancing their enthusiasm for production (because the feudal exploitation of landlords, a barrier to production, is abolished). Another example is that after the factories and mines of the Four Big Families were nationalized, the working class became the masters of the factories and mines. Because of the establishment of this new production relation, producers grasped the material conditions of production and enhanced the enthusiasm of workers for production, thereby improving the productive forces.

    The revolutionary class itself is a great productive force.

    Moreover, the revolutionary class, in breaking down the old production relations that have become fetters on the development of productive forces, and engaging in the construction of new production relations that can promote the further development of productive forces, the revolutionary class itself is also a kind of productive force. And "the greatest productive power is the revolutionary class itself" (Marx: The Poverty of Philosophy). Lenin also said: "The main productive force of mankind is the laborer" "The primary productive force of all mankind is the laborer, the diligent worker." (Lenin's Collected Works, Vol. 16, quoted from Marxism Economics edited by Ku Fuman). Without laborers, there would be no productive forces, and therefore no history of social development. At the same time, without the revolutionary action of the revolutionary class, the destruction of all old production relations and the establishment of new production relations, so that new productive forces can be further developed, is unimaginable and impossible. Therefore, it is a more important factor and an incomparably greater factor than any factor that can play a role in the changes and development of productive forces. This revolutionary class has historically been the oppressed working masses of workers and peasants, who have always been the most extensive, most active, and most revolutionary factor of productive forces. Moreover, the entire history of development, according to Comrade Stalin, "is first of all the history of the development of production, the history of the development of metabolic modes of production over thousands of years, the history of the development of productive forces and production relations." "It is also the history of the producers of material resources themselves, that is, the history of the working masses who are the basic forces in the production process and who realize the production of material resources necessary for social survival." (A Short History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), Chapter Four, Section Two). And "the liberation of the oppressed class," according to Marx, "necessarily means the construction of a new society" ("The Poverty of Philosophy"). Therefore, revolutionary class—worker and peasant mass organizations—can also play a driving role in production.

    The revolutionary regime has a decisive significance and role in improving and developing productive forces.

    The establishment of the revolutionary regime, on the one hand, implements the abolition and breaking down of all old production relations, the abolition and breaking down of all economic, political, and legal systems that suppress the development of new productive forces, as well as the transformation of ideological superstructure, liberating the productive forces and the revolutionary class. At the same time, it adopts various policies and measures, establishes all new economic, political, legal, and cultural education systems suitable for the development of the new productive forces of society, protecting and rewarding the development of production. It also has a great promoting role and significance for the development and improvement of productive forces, and even has a decisive role and significance under certain conditions. For example, today's new democratic regime abolishes the feudal and semi-feudal land system, abolishes the bureaucratic capitalist system, abolishes the privileges of imperialism, and implements various policies and measures to restore and develop industrial and agricultural production. Therefore, Lenin attached great importance to the issue of political power, believing that the basic issue of the revolution was the seizure of political power.

    The People's Liberation Army has played a significant role in the establishment and development of new democratic production relations and productive forces.

    In the current stage of China's new democratic revolution, the heroic battles and great victories of the People's Liberation Army, for the transformation of old production relations, the liberation of productive forces, for the protection of the economy of the liberated areas and the expansion of the economy of the liberated areas, for the destruction of the counter-revolutionary imperialist Kuomintang regime, and the establishment of a new regime of the people's democratic dictatorship, so as to ensure the establishment of new democratic production relations and the development of productive forces, and build an independent, free, democratic, unified, prosperous, and strong new democratic new China, has already played and will continue to play a significant role. It can even be said that without this revolutionary armed force and armed struggle, there would be no victory for today's new democratic revolution. Of course, there can be no formation and development of new democratic productive forces and production relations, as well as the construction of a new democratic society.

    The impact of science and technology on the development of productive forces.

    Science and technology are important factors in promoting the development of productive forces. Marx called science a "general productive force." They both have a significant promoting role in the development of social productive forces. Even under certain conditions, technological inventions also play a decisive role in the development of productive forces. However, regardless of science and technology, in order to play a promoting role in productive forces, they must be combined with production relations and production to participate in the production process. At the same time, the results of science and technology applied to the production process also differ due to different social and economic structures. In capitalist society, science and technology are monopolized by the bourgeoisie and used to exploit and enslave the working people. Although it also promotes the development of productive forces, it also brings unemployment, poverty, and disasters to the vast number of people. In the period of high capitalist development, the bourgeoisie, for its own selfish interests, either stifles and destroys various scientific and technological inventions or uses science and technology to prepare for wars of aggression and even to carry out wars of aggression. In socialist societies and in our new democratic society today, science and technology are mastered by the revolutionary class and used to improve people's working conditions, shorten working hours, and increase labor productivity, develop production, prosper the economy, improve people's lives, increase the material and spiritual welfare of the working people, and promote social progress. Therefore, when we examine the impact of modern science and technology on social production and the development of social productive forces, we must examine who controls science and technology, in whose hands it is mastered, and we must understand that only when science and technology are mastered by the revolutionary class can it play a great promoting role in the development of social production and social productive forces. In today's China, where the new democratic revolution is about to achieve complete victory, we should pay more attention to the significant role and significance of science and technology in the construction of the new democratic revolution and the preparation for the future transition to socialism. Because the development process of productive forces includes the development of the various elements of productive forces, and the development of the various elements of productive forces is manifested under the influence of science and technology. Today, the various classes of the Chinese revolution have or will soon grasp political power throughout the country. The old production relations that bind the development of productive forces have been shattered or are being shattered by the revolutionary hammer. Productive forces have been or are being liberated. Various social conditions that promote the development of productive forces have been largely established, especially in the liberated areas of Northeast and North China. In the future, the development of productive forces, technology, and science related to technology will increasingly increase their importance. Therefore, learning technology and mastering technology is a major task for the victorious revolutionary class in building a new society. Comrade Stalin said at the meeting of Soviet industrial activists at the beginning of the first five-year plan for socialist construction: "Bolsheviks must learn technology, the time has come for Bolsheviks themselves to become specialists! In the reconstruction period, technology determines everything." This sentence is of great significance to the comrades in the liberated areas of China who are currently restoring and developing industrial and agricultural production and embarking on the road of building a new China.

    Summary

    Political economy basically takes the mode of production as the research object. The mode of production is a unified combination of productive forces and production relations, with productive forces being the most basic, most active, and most revolutionary factor. At the same time, production relations also have a dynamic role on productive forces. The contradiction, conflict, struggle, and unity between the two, that is, their mutual action or mutual movement, form the establishment, development, and change of the mode of production, that is, the movement of the mode of production, becoming the driving force for the development of class society (in socialist society, the driving force for social development is the suitability, harmony, and unity of productive forces and production relations), and the development of the most revolutionary and most active productive force factor basically relies on the combination and development of various elements of productive forces under certain production relations. At the same time, new production relations, revolutionary classes, mass organizations, revolutionary regimes, revolutionary teams, and science and technology can all play a role in promoting the development of productive forces, and become important factors in the development of productive forces, social and economic development, and the entire social development.

　　政治经济学教程绪论(13)
    政治经济学的研究对象任务及其特点
    第一章  生产方式
    第三节  生产力与生产关系的统一——生产方式
    促进生产力发展的生产关系，也是一种生产力。
    当新的生产关系促进生产力发展的时候，这新的生产关系本身也就成为一种生产力。例如：在新民主主义社会里土地改革以后，农民有了土地、耕牛、和耕具等各种生产手段，并且废除了地主的剥削，使农民有了必要的生产条件，提高了生产的积极性（因为废除了地主的封建剥削这一生产的障碍）。又如四大家族的工厂矿山收归国有以后，工人阶级成了工厂矿山的主人翁，因为这种新的生产关系的成立，生产者掌握了生产的物质条件提高了工人生产的积极性，从而也就提高了生产力。
    革命阶级本身是一个伟大的生产力。
    不仅如此，革命的阶级，在他打破已成为束缚生产力发展的桎梏的旧生产关系，从事于能促进生产力进一步发展的新的生产关系的建设时，革命的阶级本身也是一种生产力。并且“形成最大的生产力的是革命的阶级本身”。（马克思：哲学的贫困）列宁也说过：“人类主要的生产力是劳动者”“人类全体第一的生产力是劳动者、勤劳者。”（列宁全集第十六卷，转引库富曼监辑马克思主义经济学）如果没有劳动者便不可能有生产力，因此也就不可能有社会发展的历史。同时，如果没有革命阶级的革命行动，一切旧的生产关系的摧毁，新的生产关系的建立，从而使新的生产力能够进一步的发展，乃是不可想象，也是不可能的。因此它较诸任何在生产力变化发展中所能起作用的因素，更是重要的因素，也更是伟大无比的。这种革命的阶级，在历史上便是被压迫的工农劳动群众，他们从来是生产力的一个最广大、最积极的、最革命的因素。并且，整个发展的历史，照斯大林同志说法：“首先就是生产发展史，就是数千百年来新陈代谢的生产方式的发展史，生产力与生产关系的发展史。”“同时也是物质资料生产者本身的历史，即身为生产过程中基本力量并实现着社会生存所必需的物质资料生产的那些劳动群众底历史。”（联共（布）党史简明教程第四章第二节）而“被压迫阶级的解放”，照马克思的说法，正“必然地意味着一个新社会的建设”（“哲学的贫困”）。所以，革命阶级——工人和农民的群众组织，也都能在生产中起推动的作用。
    革命的政权对生产力的提高发展，有决定的意义与作用。
    革命的政权的成立，它一方面实行废除与打破一切旧的生产关系的束缚，废除与打破一切抑制新的生产力发展的经济的、政治的法律制度，以及改造意识形态等上层建筑，将生产力，革命的阶级解放出来，同时采取种种政策与设施，建立一切新的适合社会新的生产力发展的经济的、政治的、法律的以及文化教育的制度，保护与奖励生产的发展，它对于生产力的发展提高，也是具有伟大的推动促进的作用和意义的，甚至于在一定条件下是具有着决定性的作用与意义的。例如今天新民主主义政权废除封建的与半封建的土地制度，废除官僚资本主义制度，废除帝国主义的特权，并实施种种恢复与发展工农业生产的各种政策措施，便是这样。所以列宁极度重视政权问题，他认为革命的基本问题就是夺取政权问题。
    人民解放军对新民主主义生产关系与生产力的建立与发展是起了重大的作用的。
    在现阶段中国新民主主义革命过程中，人民解放军的英勇战斗与伟大胜利，对于旧生产关系的变革，解放生产力，对于保护解放区的经济并扩大解放区的经济，对于摧毁反革命的帝国主义国民党政权，与建立人民民主专政的新政权，以保障新民主主义生产关系的建立与生产力的发展，建设一个独立自由民主统一富强的新民主主义新中国，是已经起了而且还要继续起着重大的作用的。甚至可以说，没有这种革命的武装与武装斗争，不可能有今天新民主主义革命一切的胜利。当然也不可能有新民主主义的生产力与生产关系的形成与发展，以及新民主主义社会的建设。
    科学技术对生产力发展的影响。
    科学与技术都是推动促进生产力发展的重要因素，马克思称科学为“一般的生产力”，他们对于社会生产力的发展都具有重大的推动促进的作用，甚至在一定的条件下，技术的创造发明，对于生产力的发展也起着决定性的作用。但不论科学与技术，要对生产力起推动促进的作用，必须它们通过生产关系与生产结合起来，参加到生产过程中才有可能。同时，科学技术的成果被应用于生产过程所发生的结果，也因社会经济结构的不同而不同，在资本主义社会里，科学技术被资产阶级所独占，用于压榨奴役劳动人民，虽然它也促进了生产力的发展，但同时它却给广大人民带来了失业贫困化的痛苦与灾难。到资本主义高度发展时期，资产阶级为着自己的私利，或者窒息毁灭各种科学技术的发明或者利用科学与技术准备侵略战争以至进行侵略战争。而在社会主义社会里和我们今天的新民主主义社会里，科学技术为革命阶级所掌握，用为改善人民劳动条件，缩短劳动时间，提高劳动生产力。发展生产，繁荣经济，改善人民生活，增进劳动人民物质生活与精神生活的福利，推动社会往前发展的武器。所以我们考察近代科学技术对社会生产与社会生产力发展的影响作用，必须考察科学技术为谁所掌握，掌握在那一个阶级手里，必须了解只有当科学技术被革命阶级所掌握时，才能对社会生产与社会生产力的发展起伟大推动促进的作用。在今天新民主主义革命行将完全胜利的中国，我们更应当重视科学技术对新民主主义革命建设与准备将来过渡到社会主义去的重大作用与意义。因为生产力的发展过程包含着生产力诸要素的发展，而生产力诸要素的发展是在科学技术的影响下显现出来的。在今天中国革命的各阶级已经或即将在全国范围内掌握政权，旧的束缚生产力发展的生产关系已经在革命的巨锤下粉碎或正在粉碎着，生产力已经或者正在获得解放，促进生产力发展的各种社会条件大体上业已具备，特别是在东北与华北解放区，今后生产力的发展，技术和与技术有关的科学将日益增加其重要性，因此学习技术与掌握技术，是胜利的革命阶级建设新社会中的重大任务。斯大林同志在社会主义建设第一个五年计划开始时在苏联工业活动家会议上的演说中曾说过：“布尔什维克，必须学习技术，布尔什维克自己成为专门家的时机已经到来了！在再建期中技术决定一切。”这句话对于目前恢复与发展工农业生产走上新中国建设道路上的中国解放区同志是有重大的意义的。
    小结
    政治经济学基本上是以生产方式为研究对象。生产方式是生产力与生产关系两者统一的结合体，其中以生产力为最基本最积极最革命的因素，同时生产关系对生产力也具有能动的作用。它们两者的矛盾、冲突、斗争与统一，即它们两者的相互作用或相互运动，形成着生产方式的建立、发展与变化，即生产方式的运动，成为阶级社会发展的原动力（在社会主义社会里，社会发展的原动力是生产力与生产关系的适合融洽与统一），而作为最革命的最积极的生产力因素的发展，基本上依靠于在一定的生产关系下生产力自身各种要素的结合与发展，同时新的生产关系、革命的阶级、群众的组织、革命的政权、革命的队伍以及科学与技术等等，也都能对生产力的发展起推动与促进的作用，并成为生产力发展，社会经济发展以及整个社会发展的重要因素。
