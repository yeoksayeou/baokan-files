Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, October 22nd: The seven criminals, including Kuomintang military secret agent Yan Zhongzhang, who assassinated the famous anti-Japanese General Li Zhaolin in Harbin three years ago, were sentenced by the People's Court after a public trial by the people of Harbin on the 19th. The public trial was held in Zhaolin Park, where General Li Zhaolin is buried. First, prosecutor Huang Gengfu, deputy director of the Harbin Public Security Bureau, indignantly accused the bandits of the process of killing General Zhaolin. Then, Chief Judge Rao Bin, the mayor of the city, interrogated the seven criminals one by one. Because of the conclusive evidence, the criminals confessed to their crimes. Finally, Zhang Ping, the president of the city's People's Court, announced the verdicts: Yan Zhongzhang and Liu Wensheng were sentenced to death, and the remaining five criminals, Liu Mingchen, Yan Liwei, Sun Haijing, Gao Xiyuan, and Zhang Lijun, were sentenced to fixed-term or life imprisonment according to the severity of their crimes. The masses attending the meeting enthusiastically supported this just verdict, constantly shouting slogans such as "Avenge General Zhaolin" and "Resolutely suppress reactionary elements." Then, the masses attending the meeting, led by Mayor Rao Bin, presented flowers to General Zhaolin's tomb to pay their respects.
    General Li Zhaolin (also known as Zhang Shou＠) was a native of Liaoyang, Liaodong Province. He joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1931. After the "September 18th" Incident, he engaged in anti-Japanese and national salvation work, serving successively as the Special Committee of the CPC in Fengtian, the Manchurian Committee of the CPC in Harbin, the Director of the Political Department of the 3rd Route Army of the Anti-Japanese United Army, Commander-in-Chief, and the North Manchurian Provincial Committee of the CPC. He led the 3rd Route Army across the Lesser Khingan Mountains to the Nenjiang Plain in northern Manchuria to carry out anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare, which was extremely loved by the people. After the Soviet Union declared war on Japan, he led anti-Japanese comrades to cooperate with the Soviet army to liberate the Northeast. In the autumn of 1945, he served as the Deputy Governor of the former Binjiang Province, and in November of the same year, he served as the President of the Harbin Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. At that time, Yan Zhongzhang, the leader of the detachment of the Chiang bandit military command, and Liu Wensheng, the intelligence director, actively operated in Harbin, plotting to assassinate General Zhaolin. On March 9, 1946, bandit agent Sun Geling lured General Zhaolin to Sun Haijing's house at No. 9 Shuidao Street under the pretext of discussing important matters, and gave him tea mixed with poison. General Zhaolin immediately fainted from the poisoning, and bandit agents such as Yan Zhongzhang and Liu Wensheng, who were ambushing in the building, stabbed General Zhaolin to death with daggers. General Zhaolin was only thirty-eight years old when he was killed.
