　　Introduction to a Textbook of Political Economy (2)
    Wang Xuewen
    The Object, Task, and Characteristics of Political Economy

        Chapter I. Mode of Production
        Section I. Productive Forces
        　　Labor Force
    The first element of production is the labor force, that is, the labor power of the laborer, or the power of the laborer to work. According to Marx: "By labor-power or capacity for labor is to be understood the aggregate of those mental and physical capabilities existing in a human being, which he exercises whenever he produces a use-value of any description." (Capital, Vol. 1, Part 2, Chapter 4, Section 3)

    Means of Production
    The so-called means of production include land, mines, rivers, forests, birds, animals, fruit trees, fish, turtles, shrimps, crabs, and so on. In the broad sense of nature, people can also use things such as the sun and air, but land is the main thing. In addition to land and what it contains, there are raw materials, auxiliary materials (or supplementary materials), tools, and, developing into today's machines, all these things are collectively called means of production. In short, means of production refer to things such as land, houses, tools, machines, and raw materials. (Some call it production tools, some call it means of production, but in fact they are different translations from the same foreign word.)

    Two Elements of Productive Forces
    Means of production are further divided into the object of labor and the means of labor. The object of labor refers to nature, mainly land, including what is contained below the land and what grows on the land, which becomes everything that is the object of our labor; that is, the object to which labor is applied, the object of our work. The means of labor refers to tools, machines, and so on. Among them, the two elements of means of production—the object of labor and the means of labor—are the material elements of productive forces. Labor force is the human element of productive forces. These two constitute the two elements of productive forces. (If the two elements of the means of production—the object of labor and the means of labor—are separated, and the labor force is added, it becomes the three elements of production.)

    The Influence of the Two Elements of Productive Forces on Productive Forces
    The material and human elements of productive forces, due to their different conditions, can affect productive forces if there are changes on either side or in one of them.

    The Impact of Natural Conditions and Changes on Productive Forces
    Nature is a natural warehouse for the supply of material means of subsistence for mankind. If this warehouse has abundant conditions, the source of material means of subsistence for us will also be abundant, otherwise it will be the opposite. For example: If aquatic products are abundant, the land is fertile, and the mineral deposits are rich, there will be more and better things that can become the object of our labor, and therefore, the material means of subsistence supplied to us will be more and better. For example, the coastal areas of China and the southern rivers are crisscrossed, with many fish and abundant fish production; in Mongolia, where there is a lot of water and grass, animal husbandry is also developed. For example, the land in Northeast China is fertile and does not require fertilization, and the land yields are high; Shanxi and Northeast China have rich coal deposits and thick coal seams, and coal production is abundant. At the same time, the conditions of nature itself are constantly changing. For example, rivers on land sometimes dry up, sometimes the water volume decreases, which not only affects the output of aquatic products, but also affects agricultural irrigation and water transportation. Sometimes floods cause disasters, destroying production and wealth. The Nile River in Egypt, however, floods once a year, bringing fertile soil from the upper reaches. After the water recedes, the land on both banks is particularly fertile, and the crops that grow are particularly good. Such changes have also occurred in history. In ancient China, there was a saying that the sea turned into mulberry fields, and fertile fields became barren land. The Yellow River in China, from ancient times to the present, has had countless river course changes (that is, the Yellow River has changed its course), each time bringing tragic disasters to the people along the Yellow River. These changes in natural conditions themselves can only be gradually controlled by mankind as the productive forces of human society gradually develop and science and technology gradually improve.

    In addition to its own changes, the material elements of productive forces also change due to human processing, that is, humans use their own labor force to add to nature, change nature, transform nature, so that nature can be controlled and utilized by mankind, and make nature serve mankind. For example: we dredge river channels to prevent floods; dig canals and build ponds to circulate and store water; infertile land can be added with soil and fertilized to improve soil quality; fertilization and irrigation can change soil quality; planting forests can regulate climate and rainfall, protect soil, and prevent drought, flood, and wind. The yields of various types of cultivated land with different qualities are different. Taking only paddy fields and dry land, there is a big difference. According to various surveys, dry land converted to paddy fields can generally increase by one to two times or more. In addition, seed selection in agriculture is also a method for humans to transform nature. For example: farmers select seeds, choose cold-resistant and drought-resistant varieties, or insect-resistant, less prone to disease, and high-yielding varieties. Similarly, forestry can also be improved, such as: planting trees, inserting branches, grafting, etc.; the scientific research and experiments of the Soviet Union's Michurin are famous for the transformation of plants. Not only can soil and plants be transformed, but animals can also be improved, such as cattle, horses, sheep, pigs, and chickens, ducks, geese, etc. The main methods are relying on selection, breeding, and proper feeding management. Soviet pigs can grow to 800 catties.

　　政治经济学教程绪论（２）
    王学文
    政治经济学的研究对象任务及其特点
        第一章　生产方式
        第一节　生产力
        　　劳动力
    生产第一个要素是劳动力，就是劳动者的劳动力，也就是劳动者能做活的力量。照马克思的说法：“我们所说的劳动力或劳动能力，是指存在于人的身体中，即存在于活的人格中，当人生产某种使用价值时所运用的肉体的及精神的诸种能力的总体。”（资本论第一卷第二篇第四章第三节）
    生产手段
    所谓生产手段，就是包括土地、矿山、河流、森林、鸟兽、果木、鱼、鳖、虾、蟹等等。在广义的自然中，如象太阳、空气等人们也都可以利用，但是以土地为主。除土地与土地所包藏的东西以外，还有原料、辅助材料（或称辅料）、工具，以及发展到今天的机器，这些东西总起来都叫做生产手段。总之，生产手段就是指土地、房屋、工具、机器、原料等这些东西而言的。（有人把它叫做生产工具，有人叫做生产资料，其实都是由同一外国语来的不同译语。）
    生产力的两要素
    生产手段又分为劳动对象和劳动手段二者。劳动对象是指自然，最主要的就是土地，包括土地下面蕴藏的和土地上面所生长的，成为我们劳动对象的一切；也就是劳动所加的对象，我们工作的对象。劳动手段是指工具、机器等而言。其中生产手段的两要素——劳动对象与劳动手段，是生产力的物的要素。劳动力是生产力的人的要素。这二者就构成着生产力的两个要素。（如果把生产手段中两要素——劳动对象与劳动手段分开来，再加上劳动力，就成为生产的三要素。）
    生产力两要素对生产力的影响
    生产力的物的要素和人的要素因其所具有的条件不同，其双方或其中的一方面如果有变动，都会影响生产力。
    自然的情况与变化对生产力的影响
    自然是供给人类物质生活资料的天然大仓库，这个大仓库，如果所具备的条件丰富，供给我们物质生活资料的来源也就丰富，否则就相反。例如：假若水产丰富，土地肥沃，矿山埋藏量丰饶，可以成为我们劳动对象的东西就多就好，因此，供给我们的物质生活资料也就要多而且好。例如中国沿海一带与南方河流纵横，鱼类多，产鱼丰富；蒙古水草多的地方，畜牧也就发达。又如：东北土地肥沃不用施肥土地收获量也大；山西、东北煤藏丰富煤层厚，产煤也就丰富。同时自然具备的条件本身也是时常有变动的，例如土地上的河流，有时断流，有时水量减少，不但影响水产物的产量，同时，对于农业的灌溉与水上交通运输等等方面也会发生影响。有时泛滥成灾，破坏生产与财富。而埃及尼罗河，则一年泛滥一次，从上游带来肥沃的泥土，水退后，两岸土地特别肥沃，长的庄稼特别好。这种变化历史上也是有的，中国古时有所谓沧海变为桑田，沃野变成赤土之说。中国的黄河自古以来，一直到现在，就不知道有过多少次的河道变迁（即黄河改道），每次都给黄河沿岸的人民带来悲惨的灾祸。这种自然条件本身的变化，只有人类社会生产力次第发展，科学技术次第提高的时候，才能次第为人类所控制。
    生产力的物的要素除了自身的变动以外，还有由于人类加工的变动，即人类运用自己的劳动力加到自然上去，变动自然，改造自然，使自然能为人类所控制所利用，使自然服务于人类。例如：我们浚修河道，以防水灾；开渠筑池，以流通和贮蓄水量；土地贫瘠可以加土施肥，改良土质土壤；施肥灌溉，可以改变土质；植林可以调节气候雨量，保护土壤，防旱防潦防风。各种质量不同的耕地产量各不相同，单以水地、旱地来看，就有很大的差别，根据各种调查，旱地变水地，一般可增加一倍至二倍以上。此外农业上的选种，也是人类改造自然的方法，例如：农民选择种籽，选用耐寒抗旱的，或防虫的不多生病的与产量多的各种优良品种。又如林业也同样可以改良，例如：植树、插木、接木等；关于植物的改造，苏联米邱林的科学研究与实验是有名的。不但土壤与植物可以改造，动物也可以改良，例如牛、马、羊、猪、以及鸡、鸭、鹅等都是如此，主要办法是靠选种、配种与平时饲养管理得法。苏联的猪可以长到八百斤。
