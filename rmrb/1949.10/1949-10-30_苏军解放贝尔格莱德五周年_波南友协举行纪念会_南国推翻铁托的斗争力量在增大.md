Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 29th: Warsaw dispatch from the Polish News Agency: The Polish-South Slav Friendship Association held a meeting in Warsaw on the 23rd to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the Soviet Army's liberation of Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia. Jakov Jaic, a representative of Yugoslav political refugees in Poland, stated in his address: The patriotic people of Yugoslavia clearly remember that the cannons of the Soviet Army sang the song of freedom for Belgrade five years ago. The heroes of Stalingrad and other battlefields sacrificed their lives to liberate the fraternal Yugoslav nation. Today, despite Rankovic's terror, the Yugoslav people are laying flowers on the graves of Red Army soldiers, and no amount of lies and slanders can erase from the people's memory the historical significance these graves represent. It is well known that as early as 1943, Tito was already prepared to allow Britain to occupy the entire Adriatic coast and accept Anglo-American "aid" to "liberate" Belgrade. However, these plans were shattered by the powerful Soviet offensive in September 1944. During the war, the people of South Slav were convinced of the enormous political, moral, and military strength represented by the Soviet Union. The Yugoslav people know that only with the Soviet Union, the alliance of people's democracies, and close ties with the world's workers' movement can they immediately carry out creative work after the war. Now, there are more and more patriots who hate the Tito clique serving imperialism. Commemorating the liberation of Belgrade will increase the strength of the struggle to overthrow Tito. Peter, the vice chairman of the Polish-South Slav Friendship Association, expressed his belief that the true Yugoslav Communist Party will be reborn and will lead the masses to fight against the traitors. The Polish and Yugoslav participants unanimously passed a resolution stating that no lies or fabrications by the Tito spy gang, agents of the Anglo-American war-mongers, can erase from the hearts of the South Slav people their love and gratitude for the Soviet Union, which played a decisive role in the Yugoslav liberation war. The Tito clique, instigators of war, will never be able to undermine the friendship between the Polish and South Slav people. After Yugoslavia returns to the family of peace-loving nations, this friendship will become the foundation for establishing truly fraternal relations between Poland and Yugoslavia.

　　苏军解放贝尔格莱德五周年　
    波南友协举行纪念会            
    南国推翻铁托的斗争力量在增大
    【新华社北京二十九日电】波兰通讯社华沙讯：波南友好协会二十三日在华沙举行纪念苏军解放南斯拉夫京城贝尔格莱德五周年大会，在波的南斯拉夫政治逃亡者代表雅各布·雅伊奇致词称：南斯拉夫的爱国人民清楚地记得五年前苏军的大炮为贝尔格莱德唱出自由之歌。斯大林格勒和其他战场的英雄们，为解放情同姊妹的南斯拉夫民族而牺牲生命。今天南斯拉夫人民不顾兰科维奇的恐怖行为，在红军坟墓上献花，这些坟墓所表明的具有历史意义的事实，不是任何谎言谰语能够从人民记忆中抹去的。众所周知，早在一九四三年，铁托就已经准备答应英国占领全亚得里亚海岸，并接受美英的“援助”来“解放”贝尔格莱德了。但是，这些计划都为一九四四年九月苏军的强大攻势所粉碎。在战争期间，南国人民信服苏联所代表的巨大的政治、道德和军事的力量。南斯拉夫人民知道：只有和苏联、各人民民主国家的联盟，和世界工人运动的紧密联系，他们才可能在战争结束后立即进行创造性的工作。现在，憎恨为帝国主义服役的铁托集团的爱国者愈来愈多了，纪念贝尔格莱德的解放，将为推翻铁托的斗争增加力量。波南友好协会副主席彼达表示：相信真正的南斯拉夫共产党将要再生，并将领导群众与叛徒斗争。与会的波兰人和南斯拉夫人一致通过决议称：铁托间谍匪帮美英战争贩子的代理人的任何谎言或捏造，都不能够使南国人民从心坎中抹掉他们对在南斯拉夫解放战争中起决定作用的苏联的热爱和感谢。铁托集团战争挑拨者，也绝不能破坏波南人民的友谊。在南斯拉夫回到爱好和平的国家的大家庭后，这种友谊将成为建立波兰和南斯拉夫之间的真正兄弟般的关系之基础。
