Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 13th.
From Chuanshan Town to Daxie Island, in the strait about six hundred meters wide, there is only a Mouse Mountain about two hundred meters from the south bank. From Mouse Mountain to the opposite shore of Daxie Island, it is entirely a stretch of churning sea. The communications platoon of a certain division of the People's Liberation Army on the Zhejiang Front had to erect a telephone line from the land to the island across the six hundred meters of sea. At dusk on August 20th, they began this new experiment.

The first boat for stringing the line, towing a number eight lead wire, slowly left the shore and headed towards the first target—Mouse Mountain. As soon as the boat was in the water, the waves pushed the bow off course, and the boat sped eastward with the current, losing sight of both shores and losing direction. Platoon Leader Yang Enzhu told the boatman to row towards the small black dot in front. They struggled in the turbulent waves for two hours before reaching Mouse Mountain. Everyone was filled with the joy of victory. The telephone operators on both sides worked together to pull the wire out of the water and tied it to a wooden pole. "Snap!" The wire broke in the middle, and all the hard work and efforts of the night were in vain.

But everyone was not discouraged. The next night, they set off again with a thicker number two lead wire. This time they landed smoothly. But when they pulled the lead wire out of the sea, it was caught on underwater reefs and could not be pulled up. This time they failed again.

They came a third time, and finally, on the third night, completed the first step of the line laying task.

On the fourth day, they prepared to pull the wire from Mouse Mountain to Daxie Island. The sea surface from Mouse Mountain to Daxie Island was even wider. In order to complete this more arduous task, the higher authorities allocated them ten more boats from other places, transferred twelve skilled sailors, and added some new tools.

On the 24th, during the day, they braved the drizzling rain, sailed in small boats, and pulled the lead wire towards the opposite shore again. Because they had the experience of the previous few days, the small boat sailed smoothly towards the opposite shore. When there were still five hundred meters to the shore, two enemy fighter planes suddenly appeared in the sky above the coast and carried out a frantic strafing of the small boat, causing the sea water to churn and spray everywhere. The boat was hit, and sea water gushed into the boat like a spring. Seeing that the boat was about to sink, Deputy Squad Leader Li Dakun, while tightly holding the lead wire pulled from the south bank, told the comrades who could not swim to put on lifebuoys and jump into the water to float ashore. At this time, the rescue boat from the opposite shore braved the enemy fire and rushed over. The heroic telephone soldier, Communist Party member Li Dakun, squatted on a boat that was about to sink, still tightly holding the wire in his hand, shouting: "You go to that boat first, as long as I don't sacrifice, I won't lose this line!" The enemy planes were still strafing at low altitude, and Li Dakun grabbed the lead wire even tighter. Finally, with the help of another boat, he successfully landed ashore.

A command line from Chuanshan Town, via Mouse Mountain, through the turbulent sea, was pulled all the way to Daxie Island. Thirty-six heroic telephone operators and twelve sailors, after three days and three nights of hard work, finally overcame all difficulties, completed the glorious offshore line laying task, and established telephone contact between Chuanshan Town and Daxie Island.

The ringing of the telephone: "Ding! Ding!" rang out, and the leaders sent words of commendation and comfort to the telephone operators over the phone: "Comrades: You have made contributions in the battle to liberate the Zhoushan Islands!"

　　海面上的一条指挥线
    阎质彬
    从穿山镇到大榭岛，宽约六百米的海峡中，仅在靠南岸二百多米的地方有一座老鼠山，从老鼠山到大榭岛对岸，完全是一片翻腾的海水。浙东前线人民解放军某师通讯排要在六百多米宽的海面上，架设一条由陆地通往海岛的电话线。八月二十日黄昏，他们开始了这新的试验。
    第一只架线的船，拖着一根八号的铅线，缓缓地离开了海岸，向着第一个目标—一老鼠山开过去。船刚到水中时，叫浪花把船头冲偏了，船顺流向东急驰而去，顿时看不到两岸，失去了方向。排长杨恩珠叫船手对着前面的小黑点划，他们在汹涌的波浪中，搏斗了两个钟头，才到了老鼠山，大家都充满着胜利的欢喜。两岸的电话员一齐用力把电线从水里拉出水面，往木柱上一拴，“拍！”的一声，线在当中断了，半夜的忙碌和努力全完了。
    但大家没有灰心，第二天晚上带着较粗的小二号铅丝又出发了。这次顺利的靠岸了。但当他们把铅丝拉出海面时，被海里的暗礁绊住了，拉不上来，这次又失败了。
    他们再来第三次，终于在第三天晚上，完成了第一步架线的任务。
    第四天他们又准备把线从老鼠山拉到大榭岛。由老鼠山到大榭岛的海面更加宽阔，为了完成这次更艰巨的任务，上级又从别处拨给了他们十条船，调来了十二个熟练的水手，增加了一部分新的工具。
    二十四号白天，他们冒着蒙蒙的细雨，驾着小船，拉着铅丝又向对岸开去了。因为他们有了前几天的经验，小船很顺利的驶向对岸。到岸还有五百米达，突然两架敌人的战斗机在海岸的上空出现，对着小船进行了疯狂的扫射，打的海水翻滚，水花四溅。船被打中了，海水象涌泉般的冒进船来。眼看船要沉没了。副班长李大坤一面紧紧地拉着从南岸拉来的铅丝，一面叫不会游泳的同志套起救生圈跳下去浮水登岸。这时对岸的救生船冒着敌机扫射赶来了。英勇的电话兵，共产党员李大坤，自己蹲在一只快要沉没的船上，手中仍紧紧的拉着电线，高喊着：“你们先上那只船去，只要我不牺牲，就不丢这条线！”敌机仍在低飞扫射，李大坤更紧紧的抓住铅丝，最后，他终于在另一只船的帮助下，胜利登岸了。
    一条指挥线从穿山镇经老鼠山，通过汹涌翻腾的海面，一直拉到大榭岛上。三十六个英勇的电话员和十二名船手，经三天三夜的艰苦努力，终于战胜了一切困难，完成了光荣的海上架线任务，沟通了穿山镇和大榭岛的电话联系。
    电话机子的铃声：“丁！丁！”的响起来，在电话里送来了首长对电话员嘉勉的慰问：“同志们：在解放舟山群岛的战役中，你们是有功绩的！”
