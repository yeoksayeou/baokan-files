Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 25th: Under the planned assistance of the People's Government and the spirit of self-reliance, Shanghai's industrial sector has overcome the initial difficult stages of the enemy's blockade, and production is improving daily. More than half of the city's thirty steel factories are now in operation. These operating factories have not only struggled out of the predicament of production stagnation but are also able to carry out reproduction. Recently, due to smooth inland transportation, raw materials for steelmaking and rolling, such as steel billets, pig iron, and coking coal, can be continuously transported from North China and Northeast China. Various units of the Shanghai Military Control Commission, such as the Heavy Industry Department, the Shipping Department, and the Railway Department, have also placed orders with the steel industry, greatly stimulating steel production. Based on the existing equipment conditions of each factory, coupled with the establishment of workers' new work attitudes and the improvement of production efficiency, steel production capacity may continue to increase in the future. In terms of steelmaking, the city has three open-hearth furnaces, five Bessemer converters, and five electric furnaces, all of which have started normal production. The Asia Steel Works machinery workshop and the Xingya Iron Factory are launching a production competition. There are a total of 278 private electrical equipment factories in the city. About four months before liberation, almost all of them were shut down. Currently, 182 of them have resumed work, and their products are selling well. Among the city's 1,220 machine factories, only just over 100 could barely operate in April this year. After liberation, due to orders from the Shanghai Military Control Commission's Heavy Industry Department and factories and mines in North China, Northeast China, and Shandong, 858 factories are now in operation, accounting for more than 70% of the city's machine factories. Shortly after liberation, private cotton mills in Shanghai faced difficulties due to the enemy's blockade, the lack of raw cotton, and sluggish sales of yarn and cloth, which led to a decrease in production. From mid-August onwards, with the vigorous efforts of the People's Government to connect urban and rural areas, the sales of yarn and cloth became active. Recently, Guangzhou, Weiyang, Fuzhou, and Changsha have also been liberated successively, and the South China market has also been connected, which will inevitably boost the sales of yarn and cloth. According to statistics, the number of spindles in operation in Shanghai's 53 private cotton mills has increased from 1,106,980 on June 22nd to 1,150,721 in September; yarn production has also increased from more than 18,500 pieces in July to more than 22,000 pieces currently. With the improvement of Shanghai's light and heavy industrial production, the chemical raw material industry, which serves as raw material for other industries, is also rapidly recovering. Among the city's more than 100 factories, the operating rate in July was 34%, but it has now suddenly increased to 70%.

　　政府扶助艰苦奋斗　
    冲破敌人封锁困难上海工业生产好转     
    机器工厂开工达百分之七十私营纱厂纱锭产量均有增加
    【新华社上海二十五日电】上海工业界在人民政府有计划地扶助和自力更生的奋斗之下，业已渡过敌人封锁初期的艰苦阶段，生产情况日见好转。全市三十家钢铁工厂中，现在已有半数以上开工。这些开工的工厂，不仅已从生产停滞的困境中挣扎出来，并且能够进行再生产。最近由于内地交通畅达，炼钢轧钢的原料如钢胚、生铁和煤焦等，可由华北、东北源源运来；上海军事管制委员会重工业处、航运处、铁道处等各单位又纷纷向钢铁业订货，大大刺激了钢铁业的生产。根据各厂现有设备条件，加上工人新的劳动态度的确立和生产效率的提高，今后钢铁生产能力可能继续提高。炼钢方面，全市有马丁炉三座，贝氏炉五座，电炉五座，现在都已开始正常生产。亚细亚钢业厂机械工场及兴亚铁厂，正在展开生产竞赛。全市私营电工器材工厂共有二百七十八家，在解放前四个月左右，几乎全部陷于停顿，目前亦有一百八十二家已经复工，产品畅销。全市一千二百二十家机器工厂，今年四月间只有一百多家还能勉强开工；解放后，由于上海军管会重工业处和华北、东北、山东各地厂矿纷向上海机器业订货，现在已有八百五十八家工厂开工，占全市机器厂百分之七十以上。上海私营纱厂在解放后不久，因为敌人封锁，原棉缺乏，纱布销路清淡，致产量减少，境况颇为困难。八月中旬起，经人民政府大力沟通城乡关系，纱布销路即见活动。最近广州、卫阳、福州、长沙又相继解放，华南市场也由此沟通，纱布销路势必更见畅旺。据统计，上海五十三家私营纱厂，开工纱锭已由六月二十二日的一、一○六、九八○枚，增至九月份的一、一五○、七二一枚；产纱亦由七月份的一万八千五百余件，增至目前的两万二千多件。随着上海轻重工业生产情况的好转，作为其他工业原料的化学原料工业，也在迅速恢复起来，全市一百多家工厂中，七月份开工百分之三十四，现在已突然增到百分之七十。
