Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 20th. According to the Korean Central News Agency on the 18th: The main force of the guerrillas active in the Cheonmasan area of South Jeolla Province broke into Gokseong in three routes on the night of the 8th. Some of the guerrillas attacked the police headquarters, some attacked the puppet National Defense Army Headquarters, and the rest attacked the puppet National Guard (local forces) headquarters. After three hours of battle, the guerrillas wiped out most of the puppet troops and police. The guerrillas who attacked the police headquarters broke into the detention center after defeating the resistance of the puppet troops and police in the headquarters, rescued the imprisoned people, and burned the powder magazine. The guerrillas who attacked the puppet military headquarters burned the headquarters' military warehouses and the "District Office." In this battle, the People's Guerrillas seized many automatic rifles, carbines and other weapons and military supplies, and destroyed the puppet troops and police's communication network and transportation routes, cutting off the connection between Gokseong and Suteon.

Another message: The People's Guerrillas in the Samcheok County area of ​​Gangwon Province intercepted a "dare-to-die punitive force" organized by the local puppet police station on the 16th, and seized many weapons and a railway locomotive.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 20th. According to the Korean Central News Agency, after the South Korean Syngman Rhee reactionary army shelled the Haeju Cement Factory on September 12, they fiercely bombarded the factory again on October 15, firing more than 50 shells. The reason why the Syngman Rhee reactionary army acted so barbarously was to vainly attempt to provoke a civil war of massacring the people with the support of the military force of American imperialism.
