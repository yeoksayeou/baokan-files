　　Flexible Use of Funds to Save on Freight and Remittance Interest
　　Changlu Salt Industry, North China Cotton Yarn Cloth, and Other Companies
　　Establish Appropriation Methods
　　[Our Tianjin Correspondent] To reduce fund remittances and enable flexible use of funds, Changlu Salt Industry Company and North China Cotton Yarn Cloth and Egg Products companies have established appropriation methods, which have been implemented since this month with good results. The Salt Industry Company and the Cotton Yarn Cloth Company have agreed that in places where there are Salt Industry branches (sub-branches) and Cotton Yarn Cloth branches (sub-branches), the proceeds from the sale of salt by the Salt Industry branches will not be remitted back to Tianjin but will be directly handed over to the local Cotton Yarn Cloth Company for the purpose of purchasing cotton. After the appropriation, both parties will telegraph the two companies in Tianjin to clear the accounts. The Salt Industry Company and the Egg Products Company have also made the same agreement, but it is only implemented in Beijing and Zhangjiakou. From the date of implementation to the 22nd, the Salt Industry branches (sub-branches) have allocated more than 600 million yuan in cash to the Cotton Yarn Cloth branches (sub-branches) in various places. The Salt Industry Company alone has saved 2 million yuan in remittance interest. On the Egg Products Company side, the Zhangjiakou Salt Industry branch alone has allocated more than 100 million yuan. In addition, the Salt Industry Company has cooperated with other trade organizations in terms of material transportation, which has also saved a lot of expenses. The professional division of labor and necessary cooperation can not only save remittance interest and freight but, more importantly, can maximize the effectiveness of funds and transportation.

　　灵活运用资金节省运费汇息
  　长芦盐业、华北花纱布等公司
    订立拨款办法
    【本报记者天津专电】为减少款项汇兑，并能灵活运用资金，长芦盐业公司及华北花纱布、蛋品两公司订立拨款办法，自本月实行以来，效果良好。盐业公司与花纱布公司协议规定在设有盐业分（支）公司和花纱布分（支）公司的地方，盐业分公司出售食盐的款项不汇回天津，直接交当地花纱布公司作收构棉花之用。拨款后，由双方电告津市两公司清帐。盐业公司和蛋品业公司也作了同样的协议，唯仅实行于北京、张家口两地。自实施至二十二日止，各地由盐业分（支）公司拨给花纱布分（支）公司现款六亿余元。仅盐业公司便节省去汇息达二百万元，蛋品公司方面，仅张家口盐业分公司即拨了一亿多元。此外，在物资运输方面，盐业公司与其他贸易机构合作，也节省了不少开支。专业分工与必要的合作，除节省汇息运费外更重要的是可以发挥资金及运输更多的效能。
