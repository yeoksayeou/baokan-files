Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 18th: TASS Moscow dispatch: The Pravda published on the 16th an article by季米多夫(Jimiduofu) entitled "Shameful Verdict," commenting on the verdict that found the eleven leaders of the American Communist Party "guilty." The author wrote: The farce of the "trial" of the eleven leaders of the American Communist Party, which began in New York on January 17th, reached its climax with the "conviction" on October 14th—a shameful verdict by the American reactionary ruling clique. The best sons of the American people, the loyal and noble warriors of the working class cause, have been "convicted." The vast democratic people in the United States and all over the world are very clear about the task and purpose of this "trial." That is why this "trial" was immediately called the American version of the infamous "Leipzig Trial" (i.e., the so-called Reichstag fire trial).

　　The current rulers of the United States need this anti-communist "trial" to destroy the remaining bit of democracy within the United States. The warmongers are trying to drive away all those who oppose their plans from their path. This plan is to bind the world with the shackles of American financial capital. The dominant bourgeoisie slander those who oppose them for violating the American Constitution; while they themselves shamelessly trample on the last remnants of this Constitution and build a bloody bourgeois dictatorship on its ruins.

　　季米多夫(Jimiduofu) emphasized: However, this despicable farce of "trying" working-class fighters has turned into a solemn judgment by the working class against the American fascist reactionaries. Here, the positions are reversed. The representatives of the American proletariat in the dock exposed the reactionary nature of American justice, accused the current bosses of the United States of violating democracy and the Constitution, and accused them of engaging in reactionary conspiracies and cowardly provocations.

　　Judge麦迪纳(Maidina) and Federal Prosecutor麦克高希(Maikegaoxi) were furious and violently suppressed the Communists' right to speak, putting them in shackles and handcuffs, sending them to prison, refusing them basic means of defense, intimidating witnesses, and coercing the required "evidence" under duress. But all this could not help them. The "conviction" of the class court was met with the Communists' superb spiritual and political truth of resistance, met with their heroism and high ideological standards of resistance.

　　For nine months, the people of the United States and the world watched these eleven communists and listened to their speeches. Their names are known to millions, their lives are known to the people, and they have devoted their lives to the cause of the working class and democracy with loyalty, hard work, and selflessness. As sons of the working class, they have endured hardships, which is the fate of the American proletariat. They learned the truth of Marxism-Leninism not only from books but also from the experience of struggle.

　　These eleven communists spoke bravely, frankly and solemnly like one person. They did not defend themselves. They became plaintiffs from the very beginning.

　　季米多夫(Jimiduofu), in referring to the composition of the court and the jury, pointed out: The jurors in the "trial" of the eleven Communist leaders had undergone rigorous scrutiny by the FBI before the "trial" began. The witnesses for the prosecution and the judges, prosecutors, and jurors were all in the same gang. Thirteen detectives, provocateurs, and traitors served as "witnesses" for the prosecution. Some of them are open agents of the FBI.

　　Detectives and provocateurs were given full freedom of speech, while the speeches of witnesses for the defense—all of whom were honest and simple working people—were constantly blocked. The prosecutor and 麦迪纳(Maidina) shamelessly abandoned all pretense of judicial dignity and etiquette, attempting to coerce "evidence" by threats.

　　季米多夫(Jimiduofu) concluded: But no threats or mental torture could help the executioners intimidate the witnesses of the working class. The attempt to slander the American Communist Party as a conspiracy group has failed. The American reactionaries miscalculated. The barbaric persecution of the Communists has aroused open waves of protest in the United States and all other countries in the world. The people who the American fascists wanted to depict as conspirators and criminals have become heroes in the world, the true representatives of the American people. The judicial farce staged in New York proved to be a fascist conspiracy against the people's democracy, independence, and freedom created by imperialists and reactionaries.

### 可耻的判决　真理报论文

　　可耻的判决
  　真理报论文
    【新华社北京十八日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报十六日刊载季米多夫所撰题为“可耻的判决”的论文，评述判定美国共产党十一位领袖“有罪”的判决。作者写道：“审判”十一位美国共产党领袖的滑稽剧，是一月十七日在纽约开始的，至十月十四日的“判罪”，达到最高潮——这是美国反动统治集团可耻的判决。美国人民的最优秀的子孙，工人阶级事业的忠诚和高贵的战士们被“判罪”了。美国及全世界各地广大民主人士，都很清楚这个“审讯”的任务和目的。这就是为什么这个“审讯”马上被人称为臭名昭著的“莱比锡审讯”（即所谓德国国会纵火案审讯）的美国版的原因。
    美国目前统治者们需要这种反共的“审讯”来摧毁美国国内剩余的一点民主。战争煽动者们正在试图从他们的路上赶走所有反对他们的计划的人，这个计划就是要以美国金融资本的桎梏来束缚世界。占统治地位的资产阶级诬告反对他们的人们违犯美国宪法；而他们自己则无耻地践踏了这个宪法的最后的一点残余，并在它的废墟上建立血腥的资产阶级独裁。
    季米多夫着重指出：但是，这个“审判”工人阶级战士们的卑鄙滑稽剧，却变成了工人阶级对于美国法西斯反动分子的严正裁判。在这里，地位是调换了，美国无产阶级的代表们在被告席上，揭发了美国司法的反动性质，控诉美国的现时老板们犯了违反民主与宪法的罪，并控诉他们从事反动的阴谋和卑怯的挑拨。
    法官麦迪纳及联邦检察官麦克高希恼羞成怒，暴烈地箝制了共产党人的发言权，把他们带上脚镣手铐，押送监狱，拒绝给他们以基本的辩护方法，恐吓证人，在威胁下逼出所需要的“证据”。但是，这一切都不能帮助他们。阶级法庭的“判罪”，遭遇到共产党人的高超的精神的和政治的真理的反抗，遭遇到他们的英勇和高度思想标准的反抗。
    九个月以来，美国及世界的人民注视着这十一位共产党人，听取他们的发言。他们的名字已为千百万人所熟知，他们的生活也被人们所熟知，他们毕生为了工人阶级和民主的事业而忠诚地、艰辛地和忘我地斗争。他们身为工人阶级的儿子，备尝艰辛，这乃是美国无产阶级的命运。他们不仅从书籍中，而且从斗争的经验中学到了马列主义的真理。
    这十一位共产党人象一个人一样地勇敢、坦白和严正地发言。他们并不为他们自身辩护。他们一开始就成为原告了。
    季米多夫在论及法庭及陪审团的成份时指出：“审问”十一位共产党领袖案件的陪审官们，在“审讯”没有开始进行以前，就经过联邦调查局机构的严密审查。检察处方面的证人，和法官、检察官、陪审官们都是一丘之貉。十三个侦探、挑拨者及叛徒充当了检察处方面的“证人”。其中一部分人，是联邦调查局公开的特务。
    侦探及挑拨者们被给以充分的言论自由，同时，被告方面的证人——都是忠实、纯朴的劳动人民——的发言，则不断地受到阻止。检察官及麦迪纳无耻地抛弃了司法尊严和礼仪上的一切伪装，力图用威胁逼出“证据”。
    季米多夫最后写道：但是，任何的威胁或精神上的刑罚，都不能帮助刽子手们吓倒工人阶级的证人。把美国共产党诬蔑为一个阴谋团体的企图失败了。美国反动派失算了。对共产党人所进行的野蛮迫害，在美国及世界一切其他国家中激起公开的抗议浪潮。美国法西斯分子们想描绘为阴谋者及罪犯的人们，在世界上成为英雄，成为美国人民的真正代表。在纽约上演的司法滑稽剧，证明是帝国主义者及反动派制造出来的反对人民的民主、独立和自由的法西斯阴谋。
