　　Conscientiously Convene People's Representative Conferences in Various Regions

　　The North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee has instructed that this winter and next spring, in all areas of North China, whether old or new liberated areas, people's representative conferences or people's representative meetings of all sectors of society should be universally established at the village, district, and county levels, and preparations should be made to convene people's representative conferences at the provincial level next year. This is an extremely important decision, which will further strengthen the relationship between the Chinese Communist Party's organizations at all levels, the people's governments at all levels, and the broad masses of the people, further consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, fully mobilize the strength of all classes of people, and unite to actively strive for various construction undertakings of the New Democracy.

　　"The state power of the People's Republic of China belongs to the people." This is a solemn provision in the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. To thoroughly realize this provision, it is also necessary to earnestly and meticulously carry out a series of serious and arduous tasks, the most important of which is to have the people elect people's representative conferences at all levels through universal suffrage, and for the people's representative conferences at all levels to elect people's governments at all levels to become organs representing the people in exercising state power, and to consolidate the connection between state power organs at all levels and the people on the basis of democratic centralism, and to serve the people wholeheartedly. The North China Bureau's decision to establish three-level people's representative conferences is being made after the establishment of the Central People's Government. It will be an important starting point for the concrete implementation of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in various regions and is a major event of national significance.

　　Establishing village, district, and county-level people's representative conferences or people's representative meetings of all sectors of society means that the people's democratic united front will be further consolidated and deepened. Chairman Mao summarized one of the basic and main experiences of the Chinese revolution in his article "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship": "Internally, arouse the masses, that is, unite the working class with the peasantry, the petty bourgeoisie, and the national bourgeoisie, form a domestic united front under the leadership of the working class, and develop from this to establish a people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance." From the day it was born, the Chinese Communist Party has struggled for the revolutionary great unity of the Chinese people. The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference vividly embodies such revolutionary great unity. The people of the whole country are united on the political basis of the Common Program! This is the victory of the Chinese people's revolution, and the experience of this victory must be earnestly promoted in all provinces, counties, districts, and villages across the country, uniting all forces that can be united, and forming a broad and solid united front under the leadership of the working class. The decision of the North China Bureau of the CPC to first establish three-level people's representative conferences in villages, districts, and counties is completely in line with this correct direction, and this will be the most basic and best form for realizing the great unity of the people in various regions.

　　It should be admitted that some of our comrades, due to a lack of serious study of the Party's policies and lines and Mao Zedong Thought, do not see the victory of the people's democratic united front led by the Party, have a closed-doorist mentality and style of work, and adopt an incorrect attitude towards non-Party democratic personages, and even hold a "dispensable" attitude towards the united front. They do not regard the greatest and long-term interests of the people of the whole country as the criterion for deciding policies, but replace the Party's policies with personal emotional prejudices. We should seriously remind these comrades that China is a large country with a population of 470 million, while the Chinese Communist Party currently has only 4 million members. That is to say, in every hundred people, there is approximately only one Communist Party member. Therefore, every Communist Party member should understand and must be good at uniting 99 percent of the masses, fighting together with us, in order to guarantee victory and consolidate victory. Therefore, we must be vigilant against the currently dangerous tendency of closed-doorism, improve the ideological level of Party member cadres, and seriously implement the Party's united front policy. As for the erroneous idea of only trusting the cadre meetings of a few people within the Party and not trusting the people's representative conferences, it must be overcome. Bureaucratic and formalistic approaches to the work of establishing people's representative conferences at all levels must also be prevented. Leading organs at all levels must earnestly explain the role of the people's representative conferences, mobilize organizations and cadres at all levels to prepare thoroughly, give play to the enthusiasm of the masses, and ensure that the conferences are held on schedule.

### 认真召开各地人民代表会

　　认真召开各地人民代表会
    中共中央华北局指示，今冬明春在全华北地区，不论老解放区或新解放区，一律普遍建立村、区、县三级人民代表大会或各界人民代表会议，并准备于明年召开各省人民代表大会。这是一项极重要的决定，它将会更加密切中国共产党的各级组织、各级人民政府同广大人民的关系，进一步巩固人民民主专政，充分动员各阶层人民的力量，团结一致积极努力于新民主主义的各项建设事业。
    “中华人民共和国的国家政权属于人民”，这是中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领中的庄严条文，要彻底实现这一条规定，还必须切切实实地进行一系列严肃而繁重的工作，其中最主要的是由人民用普选的方法产生各级人民代表大会，由各级人民代表大会选举各级人民政府，成为代表人民行使国家政权的机关，并使各级政权机关在民主集中制的基础上巩固与人民的连系，全心全意为人民服务。华北局关于建立三级人民代表大会的决定，正在中央人民政府成立之后，它将是各地具体执行人民政协的共同纲领的一个重要开端，是一件有着全国意义的大事。
    建立村、区、县三级人民代表大会或各界人民代表会议，这意味着人民民主统一战线进一步走向巩固和深入。毛主席在“论人民民主专政”一文中总结中国革命基本的和主要的经验之一便是：“在国内，唤起民众，这就是团结工人阶级与农民阶级，小资产阶级和民族资产阶级，在工人阶级领导下，结成国内统一战线，并由此发展到建立工人阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的国家。”中国共产党从它产生的那一天起，就为中国人民的革命大团结而奋斗，中国人民政治协商会议生动地体现了这样的革命大团结，全国人民在共同纲领的政治基础上团结起来了！这是中国人民革命的胜利，这一胜利的经验必须在全国各省、县、区、村认真地推广，团结一切可以团结的力量，以工人阶级为领导结成一个广大的巩固的统一战线。中共华北局决定第一步先在村、区、县建立三级人民代表会完全合乎这一正确方向，这将是在各个地区实现人民大团结的一个最基本的最好的形式。
    应当承认，我们有一部分同志由于对党的政策路线和毛泽东思想缺乏认真的学习，看不到党所领导的人民民主统一战线的胜利，存在着一种关门主义的思想与作风，采取了不正确的态度来对待党外民主人士，甚至对统一战线抱着“可有可无”的态度，他们不是把全国人民最大的和久远的利益作为决定政策的标准，而是以个人的感情偏见来代替党的政策。我们应该严重地提醒这些同志：中国是一个拥有四万万七千万人口的大国，而中国共产党的党员现在才有四百万人，这就是说，在一百人中，大约只有一个共产党员。因此每个共产党员都应该懂得并且必须善于团结百分之九十九的群众，同我们一道，共同奋斗，才能保证胜利和巩固胜利。因此我们必须警惕关门主义这一个当前主要危险的倾向，提高党员干部的思想水平，严肃地执行党的统一战线方针。至于那种只相信党内少数人的干部会议，而不相信人民代表会议的错误思想更必须加以克服。对于建立各级人民代表会的工作采取官僚主义和形式主义的做法也是必须防止的。各级领导机关必须认真解释人民代表会的作用，动员各级组织和干部周密地准备，发挥群众积极性，保证按期地把会议开好。
