　　Commemorate Lu Xun, Continue to Develop Printmaking Art!
　　　　Written in Commemoration of the 13th Anniversary of Mr. Lu Xun's Death

　　The achievements of Chinese revolutionary art today are, as everyone knows, inseparable from the name of Lu Xun. When Mr. Lu Xun was alive, he cultivated Chinese revolutionary art (including theory, creation, and organizational leadership), which is something we revolutionary art workers can never forget. Starting with the Left-Wing Art Movement in 1930, Mr. Lu Xun, in terms of guiding theory, developing printmaking art, introducing Soviet printmaking, sorting out China's printmaking heritage, imparting production methods, criticizing and correcting works, compiling and printing printmaking books, and other work, cultivated many revolutionary art workers. After Lu Xun's death, we inherited Mr. Lu Xun's legacy and persisted in the cause of literary and artistic construction. Comrade Mao Zedong once taught us: "Lu Xun's direction is the direction of China's new culture!" After eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan and three years of the War of Liberation, under the leadership of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought, the Chinese revolutionary literary and art army converged. This included literary and art workers from the Soviet areas of China during the ten years of civil war, left-wing literary and art workers from the White areas, and literary and art workers from the old and new liberated areas during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation. The front of revolutionary art has expanded, and the People's Republic of China has been established. The New Democratic Revolution is about to achieve complete victory throughout the country, and conditions for the development of various new arts are in place. The people's needs and demands for various arts are also more extensive and diverse. In the current new situation, in terms of art work—in terms of artistic thought—some new issues have arisen that need to be discussed. Therefore, commemorating Lu Xun is of great significance.
　　It is certainly true that each stage has different art work tasks. However, the orientation of literature and art towards workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serving the working people, is a common goal in any period. When the people and the revolution are being attacked, slaughtered, and oppressed by the reactionary ruling class colluding with imperialists, the material conditions for revolutionary art are very difficult, and the people's need for art works is limited. The needs of rural and urban areas should also be distinguished. The decision to have cities lead the countryside is, in art work, clearly a turning point of epoch-making significance. Before this, the reason why revolutionary art particularly developed printmaking was due to objective needs. Mr. Lu Xun always implemented the spirit of literature and art serving the people. Based on objective needs, he vigorously promoted printmaking, which enabled printmaking to play a certain role in propaganda and education in the people's revolution, and achieved glorious achievements! However, it is undeniable that there are still some shortcomings in our art work, and even under the rapid and victorious development of the new situation, art work cannot adapt to and meet objective needs. In particular, there may still be some biases in artistic thinking. For example, regarding art such as oil painting and sculpture as "elevated" art, and regarding woodcut New Year pictures, illustrations, and comic strips in printmaking as "popular" art, and opposing them, is an incorrect view. At the same time, in terms of expression methods, believing that Western painting techniques are "elevated" art, and believing that the "single-line flat coloring" of Chinese painting techniques is "popular" art, and believing that the two techniques cannot be unified, believing that the latter is a "backward" thing, saying that "single-line flat coloring" New Year pictures, illustrations, and comic strips will "not be popular" after entering the city, and so on. At the same time, the one-sided idea that only engaging in large-scale oil paintings and giant sculptures is "great art" has emerged. Little do they know that whether a work is great or not is not built on the size of the work or the cost of the materials. Cities will build various museums, exhibition halls, and public halls, which require large-scale oil paintings and large sculptures. Oil painting, as a tool, has its power of expression in painting. We need to promote it, transform it, and develop it. In the past, we did not have the material conditions to create large numbers of oil paintings and sculptures, but today we do. However, we should still pay attention to transforming the harmful influence of Western European bourgeois painting on oil painting, watercolor painting, and other types of painting, correct the remnants of foreign dogmatism since the May Fourth Movement, remove the dross of formalism, and be vigilant against the danger of closing the door to improvement and detaching from the masses! Originally, Mr. Lu Xun had already seen this bias and proposed solutions. He said:
　　"I do not advise young art students to despise large-scale oil paintings or watercolor paintings, but I hope that they will attach equal importance to and strive to create comic strips and illustrations for newspapers and books. Naturally, they should study the works of famous European artists, but they should also pay attention to the embroidered images and picture books in old Chinese books, as well as single-sheet flower papers. These studies and the creations derived from them will naturally not be viewed in the same way as the so-called masters are viewed by some people as a matter of course, but I dare to believe that the masses love to see them, and the masses are grateful for them." (See "Random Thoughts from the South and North," "In Defense of Comic Strips," written on October 25, 1932). He also said: "What is being defended is only that comic strips can become art, so that young students will not be misled by misinterpretations, dare to create, and gradually produce popular works." (See the same book, 1933, "On Reprinting Woodcuts"). Woodcut art, Mr. Lu Xun has opened up a new path in recent years, which has been widely recognized by intellectuals; but is it only with the "chiaroscuro" of Western painting that it can be considered "elevated" art? Lu Xun's opinion is this, he believes: "The current woodcuts are mostly made for intellectuals, so if they are used in comic strips, the general public still cannot understand them. I advocate that comic strips should use more old painting methods." ("Lu Xun's Letters," written in 1935). He also said: "If we refer to the stone carvings of the Han Dynasty, the illustrations of books in the Ming and Qing Dynasties, and pay attention to the so-called 'New Year pictures' that are popular among the people, and integrate them with new European methods, we may be able to create a better kind of printmaking." (See the same book). Using the old Chinese painting method, referring to the embroidered images and picture books in old Chinese books, is to produce works needed by the masses, for the general public to understand, it can be seen that the use of single-line flat coloring is not wrong. Although the old Chinese painting method is not limited to this one. In fact, there are many famous works in ancient and modern China and abroad that use single-line illustrations without chiaroscuro, especially in the history of Chinese painting, there is a rich heritage available for critical acceptance. In practice, the New Year pictures, comic strips, peep shows, picture magazines, pamphlets, and illustrations in books and newspapers made in the old liberated areas, using the single-line, no chiaroscuro Chinese painting method, have also been welcomed by the broad masses of the people, and their artistic effect has not been reduced as a result. On the contrary, this is a greater achievement gained after correcting the overemphasis on chiaroscuro. This kind of printmaking art has found the path pointed out by Lu Xun in the course of creating national forms. This path cannot be simply regarded as "single-line flat coloring" to oppose Western painting (oil painting, watercolor, sketching, etc.), but should be regarded as a new printmaking art that integrates Chinese and foreign painting methods. This expression method, and even oil painting, sculpture, and large-scale art should pay attention to it, using methods liked by the people to reflect the real life of the people. I have never advocated abandoning the chiaroscuro method in modern painting. Oil painting and printmaking have common points, but the characteristic of printmaking is for printing. Mr. Lu Xun mentioned the characteristic of "going far and reaching the masses" in "North Ping Jian Pu," which is also a common characteristic of all printmaking. Printmaking art is easy to promote and popularize. It has been developed in the past revolutionary art, and it still needs to be continued to develop it now and in the future.
　　Printmaking: including woodcut, zinc etching, steel engraving, lithography, and all illustrations for printing in newspapers and books (engraved or painted monochrome and color paintings on paper) and single printed posters, etc. Western "painting" creation mainly refers to oil painting, which is the difference between it and printmaking. However, the history of Western painting also touches on printmaking. In the history of Chinese painting, there is no oil painting. The "oil paint painting" of painters is different from Western oil painting. The traditional methods of Chinese painting are mainly line drawing (single line) and coloring (watercolor and mineral pigments). The "dry rubbing" and "shading method" of ink painting, and the "hook and outline method" and "boneless method" of flower and bird sketching, "meticulous brushwork" is mostly painted on painting albums, and "freehand brushwork" is mostly painted on rice paper. The effects produced by these tools and materials are naturally different from those painted on canvas with Western oil paint. Here, it is not to say that creating oil paintings cannot absorb certain techniques of Chinese painting, but that the techniques of Chinese painting give modern printmaking more things to adopt, especially in terms of embroidered image illustrations. In terms of brushwork, following the methods pointed out by Mr. Lu Xun to create has achieved some excellent results.
　　In addition, there is a kind of seemingly right but actually wrong view that as long as it is painted and made into a plate, there is no need to make printmaking anymore. Zinc etching is naturally rare in China. It is not impossible to make a zinc plate from a pen drawing instead. However, woodcut is easy to make, and the knife technique still has its characteristics. The fun and effect of color woodcut and oil painting and watercolor painting are also not lacking. Although the expressive power of woodcut art cannot be applied to large-scale works, it still has a unique style and its power. It should be continued to develop, especially illustrations and comic strips. Whether it is engraved or painted, if its purpose is for printing, reproduction, and for "going far and reaching the masses," if Mr. Lu Xun were still alive now, I firmly believe that he would continue to develop it!
　　Chairman Mao's speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art has already summarized these issues. However, some art workers still do not understand the views on "popularization" and "improvement." Printmaking art is not a "trivial skill." It itself has the convenience of "going far and reaching the masses," but it does not necessarily "popularize" to the masses. For example, intellectuals know that woodcut is "revolutionary art," but the people do not necessarily welcome the technique of overemphasizing black and white chiaroscuro. In fact, there are still woodcuts (including monochrome and color) and paintings that float in front of intellectuals and cannot be understood by the broad masses of the people. Such woodcuts (including monochrome and color) and such paintings cannot be regarded as "popularized." In fact, the "single-line" and "flat-colored" printmaking is welcomed by the people because it uses realistic techniques and reflects the real life of the people, and it is indeed worthy of being popularized. If it is said that it still has some shortcomings and needs to be improved (for example, improving its ideological content), it means "improving on the basis of popularization," rather than simply improving the closed-door skills by detaching from the masses, and preventing "improvement" to the mire of Western European bourgeois art, then printmaking art will be highly developed!
　　Mr. Lu Xun's literary and artistic activities and literary and artistic thoughts are very rich, and we need to widely develop them. I am only raising the issue of continuing to develop printmaking art here, hoping to help our new art movement, and combine Lu Xun's literary theory with Chairman Mao's literary thought to promote the printmaking creation needed by the people, and Chinese printmaking will be more prosperous!

　　纪念鲁迅，继续发展版画艺术！
  　为鲁迅先生逝世十三周年纪念而作
    祜  曼
    中国革命美术到了今天，能够有了这样的成绩，正如大家所周知的，是和鲁迅的名子分不开的。鲁迅先生在世的时候，培植了中国的革命美术（包括理论、创作和组织领导等工作），这是我们革命美术工作者所永生不能忘记的，从一九三○年左冀美术运动开始，鲁迅先生在指导理论方面、在发展版画艺术方面、介绍苏联版画、整理中国版画遗产、传授制作方法，批评、改正作品，编印版画书册，种种工作，培养了许多革命美术工作者，在鲁迅逝世以后，我们承继了鲁迅先生的遗志，坚持了文艺建设的事业，毛泽东同志曾经教导我们说：“鲁迅的方向，就是中国新文化的方向！”又经过八年抗日战争，三年解放战争，在毛泽东文艺思想领导之下，中国革命文艺大军汇合了，这包括十年内战时期中国苏区的文艺工作者和白区的左冀文艺工作者，抗日战争和解放战争时期老解放区和新解放区的文艺工作者，革命美术的阵线扩大了，中华人民共和国已经成立了，新民主主义的革命在全国范围内就要取得完全的胜利，各种新美术发展的条件都已具备了，人民对各种美术的需要和要求也更加广泛和多样，在目前新的形势下面，在美术工作方面——在艺术思想方面，产生了一些新的问题，需要提出讨论的，为此，我们纪念鲁迅，是有极大意义的。
    各个阶段有各个不同的美术工作任务，当然这是肯定的。但是，文艺面向工、农、兵，为劳动人民服务，则是任何时期共同的目的。当人民和革命被反动统治阶级勾结帝国主义者进攻屠杀和压迫的时期，革命美术的物质条件是非常困难的，人民所需要的美术作品是有其一定的限度的，农村和城市的需要也应有所区别。城市领导农村的政策的决定，在美术工作上很明显的是一个划时代的转捩点。在这以前，革命美术之所以特别发展了版画，是具有客观需要的原因，鲁迅先生始终贯彻了文艺为人民服务的精神，他根据客观需要，奋力提倡版画，这样，使版画在人民革命中就起了一定的宣传教育的效果，获得了光荣的成就！但是，不可否认，在我们的美术工作上还存在某些缺点，甚至在新形势迅速胜利开展之下，美术工作还不能适应和满足客观的需要，特别是，在艺术思想上还可能存在某些偏向，例如：把油画、雕塑这类艺术认为是“提高”的艺术，把版画中的木刻的年画、插图、连环图画等认为是“普及”的艺术，并且把它们对立起来，这就是不正确的看法。同时，在表现方法上，认为西画手法才是“提高”的艺术，认为国画手法的“单线平涂”是“普及”的艺术，并且，认为两种手法不能统一，认为，后者是“落后的”东西，说：“单线平涂”的年画、插图、连环画，进城后就“吃不开了”，等等。同时，产生了只有搞大幅油画和巨型雕刻才是“伟大的艺术”的这偏面思想。岂不知作品伟大不伟大，不建筑在篇幅的大小和材料的贵贱上，城市将要建设各种博物院、陈列馆和公共厅堂，是需要大幅油画和大型雕刻的，油画这一工具在绘画上是具有它的表现的力量，我们是需要提倡它改造它并且发展它，从前我们还没有那种大量创作油画和雕刻的物质条件，然而今天有了，但是还应该注意改造油画、水彩画等一向所受的西欧资产阶级绘画中的有害影响，纠正五四以来洋教条的残余，清除形式主义的滓渣，警惕关门提高、脱离群众的危险！本来，这种偏向鲁迅先生早已看见了的，并且提出解决了的，他说：
    “我并不劝青年的艺术学徒蔑视大幅油画或水彩画，但是希望一样的看重并且努力于连环图画和书报的插图，自然应该研究欧洲名家的作品，但也应该注意于中国旧书上的绣像和画本以及单张的花纸，这些研究和由此而来的创作，自然没有现在的所谓大师的受着有些人们的照例的观赏，然而我敢相信，对于这，大众是爱看的，大众是感激的。”（见“南腔北调集”、“为连环图画辩护”、一九三二年十月二十五日写）他又说：“所辩护的，只是连环图画可以成为艺术，使青年学徒不被曲解所迷，敢于创作，并且逐渐产生大众化的作品而已。”（见同上书，一九三三年，“论翻印木刻”），木刻艺术，这些年来鲁迅先生已经开辟出来一条崭新的道路，是广泛的知识分子所承认了的；然而是不是只有用西画的“明暗法”才算是“提高”的艺术呢？鲁迅的意见是这样的，他认为：“现在的木刻还是对于知识者而作的居多，所以倘用于连环图画，一般的民众还是看不懂，我主张连环图画，要多用旧画法。”（“鲁迅书简”、一九三五年写）他又说：“倘参酌汉代的石刻画像，明清的书籍插画，并且，留心民间玩赏的所谓‘年画’和欧洲的新法融合起来，也许能够创作出一种更好的版画。”（见同上书）用中国的旧画法，参考中国旧书上的绣像和画本，是为了产生群众需要的作品，为了一般群众看得懂，可见采用单线平涂的画法，并非错误。虽然中国旧画法也并非只此一种。实际上，插图中采用单线条无明暗手法的，古今中外不乏名作，特别在中国绘画史上，有丰富遗产，可供批判接受，在实际上，老解放区所作的年画、连环图画、洋片、画报、小册子以及书报上的插图，采用单线条无明暗的中国画法，亦已受到广大人民的欢迎，而且，其艺术效果并没有因此而降低，相反的，这是在纠正了过分强调明暗以后获得来的更大成绩。这种版画艺术在创造民族形式的途中已找到了鲁迅所指的道路，这个道路，还不能简单的把它视作“单线平涂”以与西画（油画、水彩、素描等）作对立的看法，而应该把它看作融合中外画法所发展的新版画的艺术，这种表现方法，甚至是油画雕刻大型艺术也应该注意它，用人民所欢喜的手法来反映人民真实的生活。我从来也没有主张过废弃现代绘画上的明暗法，油画和版画是有共同点的，不过版画的特点是为了印刷，鲁迅先生在“北平笺谱”上，曾提到“行远及众”的特点，也是所有版画共同的特点。版画艺术便于推广和普及，在过去革命美术上发展了它，而且在现在和将来还需要继续发展它。
    版画：包括木刻、锌刻、钢刻、石版画、以及一切为了书报上印刷用的插图，（刻的或画在纸上的单色画和彩色画）和单张的印刷的招帖画等。西方“绘画”创作，主要的是指的油画，也就是和版画的区别之所在。但是，在西方绘画史上，也附带论及版画。在中国绘画史上，本无油画，画工的“油漆彩画”，和西方油画不同，中国绘画的传统方法，主要的是白描（单线）和设色（水彩、和矿质颜料两种），水墨画的“干皴”和“浓淡法”以及花鸟写生的“钩勒法”和“没骨法”，“工笔画”画在画缉上的居多，“写意画”画在宣纸上的居多，这些工具、材料所产生的效果，自然和用西画油画颜料画在画布上的不同，这里，不是说作油画就不能吸收中国画法的某些技巧了，而是说，中国画的技巧给与现代版画以可供采用的东西，就更多些，特别是在绣像插图方面，在笔法方面，能够遵循着鲁迅先生指出的办法而创作的，已获得若干优秀的成绩了。
    另外，还存在着一种，似是而非的看法，认为只要画出来、制版，就不必再作版画了。锌刻在中国自然很少，作钢笔画制成锌版，未尝不可代替。但是木刻作法简便，刀法表现还有它的特点，套色木刻和油画、水彩的趣味、效果，亦有不乏，木刻艺术的表现力量虽然不能施用大幅，也还是单独具有一种风格和它的力量，它应被继续发展，特别是插图和连环图画，无论是刻是画，凡是它的目的为了印刷、复制，为了“行远而及众”的版画，如果鲁迅先生现在还是活着的话我坚决相信，他还是要继续发展下去的！
    毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话，对于这些问题，本来已经总结过了的。但是，在“普及”和“提高”的看法上，直到现在还有些美术工作者弄不清楚。版画艺术，并非“雕虫小技”，它本身具有“行远及众”的便利，但是，它不一定就都能“普及”到群众中去，例如，知识分子知道木刻是“革命艺术”，但是老百姓不一定欢迎过分强调黑白明暗的手法，实际上，也还有漂浮在知识分子眼前，而为广大人民看不懂的木刻，这样的木刻（包括单色的和套色的）以及这样的绘画是不能算作“普及”的。实际上“单线”和“平涂”的版画因为它用写实的手法并反映了人民的真实生活而为人民所欢迎的，倒是配称得普及，如果说，它还存在着某些缺点而需要提高的话，（例如提高思想性）那是说“在普及基础之上提高”，而不是脱离群众的单纯技巧的关门提高，预防着“提高”到西欧资产阶级艺术的泥坑子里去，版画艺术才会得到高度的发展！
    鲁迅先生的文艺活动与文艺思想是很丰富的，有待于我们广泛的发挥。我在这里只提出继续发展版画艺术的问题，希望对我们的新美术运动有所帮助，把鲁迅的文艺理论和毛主席的文艺思想结合起来，以推动目前人民需要的版画创作，中国的版画将会更加繁盛的！
