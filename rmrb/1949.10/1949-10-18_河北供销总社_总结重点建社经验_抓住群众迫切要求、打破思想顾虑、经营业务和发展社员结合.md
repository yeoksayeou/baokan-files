Hebei Supply and Marketing Cooperative
  Summarizing Key Experiences in Building Cooperatives
    Grasping the Urgent Demands of the Masses, Breaking Down Ideological Concerns, and Combining Business Operations with the Development of Members
    [Baoding Electric Dispatch] The Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative has summarized the work of focusing on cooperative construction in the former Jizhong District over the past three and a half months. Since the former Jizhong Cooperative Conference in April this year, various regions have implemented new cooperative principles and policies and conducted key demonstrations. They mastered the three key counties of Anxin, Dingxian, and Cangxian, using the long-distance transportation and sale of local specialties (mats, homespun cloth, straw braid) as the main business to carry out key cooperative construction. General counties also selected one or two market towns with convenient transportation and agricultural and sideline product distribution as key experiments. Fifty-one counties universally changed the original county promotion cooperatives into supply and marketing cooperatives. One hundred and thirty key supply and marketing cooperatives were established in market towns, along with twenty-two district branches, absorbing more than 100,000 members and 100,000 shares. Including the old cooperatives, villages with cooperatives accounted for about one-tenth of the region, and members accounted for slightly more than 3.3% of the region's population. According to incomplete statistics from the supply and marketing cooperatives in fourteen counties alone, more than 2.9 million jin of cotton seeds, more than 2.7 million jin of peanut seeds, more than 1.9 million jin of fertilizer, and more than 1,000 waterwheels were lent and sold below market prices. In order to support sideline production in disaster areas, specialized cooperatives for homespun cloth, straw braid, reed mats, etc., were established successively. According to statistics from twelve counties, more than 240,000 bolts of homespun cloth, more than 40,000 pockets, 1,600 bundles of straw hats, more than 60,000 mats, more than 4 million jin of leather, and forks, cloth, shoes, etc., were marketed. According to the needs of the masses, living materials were supplied. According to the statistics of twenty-seven counties for two months, the total value of sales and loans was 322.174 million yuan, and the total amount below market price was more than 13 million yuan. In order to strengthen the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas and the adjustment of surpluses and deficiencies with neighboring regions, 7.2 million jin of grain were exchanged for cloth and cotton, and 20,000 bundles of imported yarn from the China Textile Corporation were exchanged for grain, which was supplied to members in disaster areas and grain-deficient areas. In total, the masses benefited from business equivalent to more than 4 million jin of rice.
    In addition to achieving the above results, several major experiences were gained in this key cooperative construction work: (1) The selection of key points must be important market towns in areas with salable and promising specialties. First, it is necessary to understand the local economic characteristics, the ideological concerns of cadres and the masses, and, in light of the actual situation, implement the new cooperative policies, break down their concerns, and improve their understanding of the cooperatives, focusing on the urgent demands of the masses to carry out cooperative construction. (2) Business operations and the absorption of members must be closely integrated. First, conduct one or two universal transactions slightly below the market price so that the masses can see the benefits in practice, and then conduct transactions with members and non-members at different prices. Zhao County combined the business of exchanging coarse grains for wheat seeds and quickly developed 400 members, influencing 105 people to voluntarily organize and buy shares. (3) Taking the Party branch as the core is an effective way to develop members. Mobilize Party members to publicize and deliberate, and take the lead in joining the cooperative.
    There are still several problems that need to be solved in the key cooperative construction: (1) Some county supply and marketing cooperatives are afraid that they will not be able to supply enough if there are too many members and are not actively developing them. (2) Some still retain the idea of bestowing favors, neither collecting share capital nor urging payment, and selling goods too far below market prices. For example, the Qingxian Supply and Marketing Cooperative supplied goods to members 25% below the market price, resulting in losses within the cooperative. (3) The relationship between some cooperatives and state-owned economic departments is not close or normal, and there is a mentality of taking petty advantages, failing to abide by trade credit and long-term arrears. Some cadres in state-owned trading departments are afraid of trouble and unwilling to deal with cooperatives. Other incorrect phenomena, such as neglecting the transformation of old cooperatives, not paying attention to the organization and education of members, and simply engaging in commerce, should be corrected in the future.

　　河北供销总社
  　总结重点建社经验
    抓住群众迫切要求、打破思想顾虑、经营业务和发展社员结合
    【保定电】河北省供销总社总结原冀中区三个半月重点建社工作。自今年四月原冀中合作会议以后，各地贯彻了新的合作方针与政策，作了重点示范。掌握了安新、定县、沧县三个重点县，以远途运销当地特产（席、土布、草帽辫）为主要业务，进行重点建社。一般县份也以此条件选择了交通要道，农、副业产品集散的一、二个集镇作为重点试验。五十一个县普遍将原来的县推进社，改为供销社。建立了集镇重点供销社一三零处，区分社二二个，吸收社员十万余人，社股十万余个。连同旧社，全区有社的村约占十分之一，社员占全区人口百分之三点三强。仅据十四县供销社不完整的统计，低于市价贷卖棉种二百九十余万斤。花生种二百七十余万斤，肥料一百九十余万斤，水车千余辆。为扶植灾区副业生产，先后建立了土布、草帽辫、苇席等专业社。据十二个县的统计：推销土布二十四万余匹，口袋四万余条，草帽一千六百打，席六万余片，皮硝四百余万斤，及杈子、布匹、鞋等。根据群众需要，供给了生活资料。据二十七个县两个月的统计，售贷总值三万万二千一百七十四万元，低于市价总额为一千三百余万元。为了加强城乡物资交流与友邻区的有无调剂，以布、棉换回粮食七百二十万斤，以粮食换回中纺洋纱两万捆，供给了灾区和缺粮地区的社员。总计在业务中使群众共得利折米四百余万斤。
    这段重点建社工作中，除获得上述成绩外，并获得了几点主要经验：（一）重点的选择，必须是有销路有前途特产区的重要集镇，首先要了解当地的经济特点，干部、群众的思想顾虑，结合实际情况，贯彻新合作政策，打破其顾虑，提高对社的认识，抓着群众的迫切要求进行建社。（二）经营业务与吸收社员必须紧密结合，先稍低于市价，普遍的交易一两次，使群众在实际中看到好处，然后社员与非社员在分别价格进行交易。赵县结合以粗粮换麦种的业务，很快的发展了四百个社员，影响一百零五人自动组织起来入股。（三）以支部为核心，是发展社员的有效办法。发动党员宣传酝酿，带头入社。
    在重点建社中还存在几个问题需要解决：（一）有的县供销社怕社员多供给不上，不积极发展。（二）有的还残存着恩赐观点，不缴股金也不催要，货物过低于市价等。如青县供销社供给社员货物低于市价百分之二十五，致社内受损失。（三）有的社和国营经济部门关系不密切、不正常，存在占小便宜思想，不守贸易信用长期拖欠；国营贸易部门有些干部怕麻烦不愿与合作社多打交道。其他如忽视对旧社的改造，不注意对社员进行组织教育，只是单纯作商业等不正确现象，今后都应注意纠正。
