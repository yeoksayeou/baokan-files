　　On Enthusiasm for Learning and Work
    Yí Qún
    I remember when I was in school, some students were sometimes exuberant and sometimes resentful in their studies. Why? Because they didn't know for whom they were learning and what they were learning for. If they got good grades, they would show off, feeling superior to others. Once their grades were worse than others, they would be dejected, either blaming the teacher or throwing their books.
    In my work, I have encountered this type of person again. Their enthusiasm is aimed at showing off everywhere. They are impatient when handling problems or attending meetings, lack humility, are not realistic, and do not carefully analyze and consider the opinions of others. Therefore, they intentionally or unintentionally conceal the strengths of others. When this kind of worker leads or participates in a department's work, it seems that only he is active and capable, while others are not. In reality, they hinder the enthusiasm of others.
    This type of person is least able to help others well, and it is difficult for them to do well in learning and work.
    Only by establishing a worldview of serving the people and contributing to the construction of the motherland can we be constantly and tirelessly encouraged in our enthusiasm for learning and work. In school, not only should we learn well ourselves, but also motivate everyone to do well in their studies. In the workplace, we should not work for personal prominence, but to do the work well, play a backbone role, help others, be good at developing the strengths of others, make up for the shortcomings of others, humbly examine ourselves, and listen to the opinions of others to improve our work. Only in this way can we enhance the unity of cadres and promote work efficiency.
    Loyalty and responsibility to work is true revolutionary enthusiasm, and only then can we do well in our work and study.

　　谈学习工作的积极性
    怡群
    记得在学校里的时候有个别同学在学习中有时候兴高彩烈，有时怨天尤人，为什么呢？因为不知道自己为谁而学，学了作什么。分数考好了就耀武扬威，觉得比别人高一等，一旦分数不如别人了就垂头丧气，不是怨先生，就是摔书本。
    在工作中，我又遇到了这种类型的人，他的积极性是为了处处想表现自己，处理问题或开会时急躁，不虚心，不实事求是，不细心分析、考虑别人的意见，因此有意无意的便掩盖了别人的长处，这种工作者领导或参加一个部门工作时，好象就显得只有他一个人积极，能干，而别人都不积极，实际上却妨碍了别人的积极性。
    这种人最不能好好地帮助别人，学习与工作也是很难搞好的。
    只有确立为人民服务的人生观，为建设祖国而贡献出力量，才能始终不懈的鼓舞着学习和工作的热情。在学校里，不但自己学习得好，同时带动大家搞好学习。在工作岗位上，做工作不是为了个人突出，而是为了做好工作，起骨干作用，帮助别人，善于发挥别人的长处，弥补别人的短处，虚心检讨自己，听取别人的意见改进工作，这样才能增强干部团结，推进工作效率。
    对工作忠诚负责，这才是真正革命的积极性，才能搞好工作和学习。
