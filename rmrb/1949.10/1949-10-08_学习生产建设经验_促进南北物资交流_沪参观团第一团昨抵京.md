　　Learning from Production and Construction Experience, Promoting North-South Material Exchange
    The First Shanghai Visiting Group Arrives in Beijing Yesterday
    [Beijing News] The first group of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce Preparatory Committee Northeast and North China Visiting Group arrived in Beijing yesterday (the 7th) at 2:00 PM. Rong Guang, Director of the Reception Department of the Central Financial and Economic Committee, Shi Lin, Secretary-General of the Beijing Industry and Commerce Bureau, Fu Huating of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Wang Xiangchen of the Industrial Association, and Hu Jue-wen, the leader of the group staying in Beijing, and Deputy Leader Yu Huan-cheng, and others, totaling more than ten people, went to the station to welcome them. The group consists of forty-two people, of whom more than two-thirds are from industrial circles, including experts in various aspects of industry. The main purpose of this trip is to visit the industrial and mining construction in North and Northeast China, to learn from the experience of restoring and developing production in the old liberated areas, and to promote the exchange of materials between the North and the South. At the welcome meeting at the station, after Shi Lin of the Industry and Commerce Bureau delivered a welcome speech, Jin Xuecheng, the Deputy Secretary-General of the group, delivered a reply. He first paid his respects to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and the government leaders, and then said: "We are grateful to the people of North and Northeast China for supporting the People's Liberation War, liberating Shanghai, and making Shanghai the people's Shanghai. Especially after the liberation of Shanghai, they vigorously supported Shanghai with materials such as grain, fuel, and cotton, enabling Shanghai, which had been destroyed by the imperialists and the Kuomintang bandits, to quickly overcome many difficulties and restore production. We express our heartfelt gratitude." Due to the climate, the group will stay in Beijing for three days before departing for Shenyang, then Dalian, Harbin, and Jiamusi for visits. Then they will return to Beijing and go to Shijiazhuang and Tianjin. The entire trip is expected to take about a month and a half.
