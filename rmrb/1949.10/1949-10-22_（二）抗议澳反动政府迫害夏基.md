(II) Protest the Australian Reactionary Government's Persecution of Sharkey

　　Eight months ago, French Communist leader Maurice Thorez's declaration condemning the imperialist anti-Soviet war plot and calling for the defense of world peace became the clarion call for the surging worldwide movement to defend peace. Peace-loving people of the world unanimously and resolutely vowed: "Never participate in a war against the Soviet Union! Never produce a drop of oil for an anti-Soviet war! Never send a single person for an anti-Soviet war!" This call, and the magnificent and powerful response it sparked, dealt a head-on blow to the imperialist war camp.

　　Australian Communist Party General Secretary Sharkey, on March 5th of this year, issued a statement on behalf of the Australian working people, supporting the Thorez declaration, and saying: "The Soviet Union is a peace-loving country, and she will not declare war on any country. The Soviet Union will only rise up to fight when she herself is attacked." The statement also resolutely stated: "If Soviet troops come to Australia in pursuit of aggressors, the Australian working class will welcome them, just as the European people welcomed the Soviet troops when they were liberated." This statement contains irrefutable truth and embodies the expectations of peace-loving people all over the world. But it was precisely this statement, representing the unanimous interests of the Australian people, that struck a raw nerve in the Australian reactionary government, which relies on the United States to exploit the people. Sharkey was thus sentenced to three years in prison by the "Federal Special Court" on the "charge" of "publishing treasonous remarks."

　　This shameful verdict illustrates the legal logic of imperialism and its lackeys! Sharkey's statement opposes wars of aggression, while the Australian reactionary government is precisely a pawn of the United States in launching wars of aggression! Sharkey's statement opposes the North Atlantic Treaty, while the Australian reactionary government in the Pacific is just a small minion raised in the "North Atlantic Treaty" trap! This is how the Australian reactionary government openly and shamelessly involves Australia in the United States-organized anti-Soviet war criminal plan!

　　The truth we see in Sharkey's statement has become the "crime" on which the right-wing Labor government relies to persecute communists. However, the people's eyes are clear, and they know that the imperialist plot to launch a war of aggression against the peace-loving Soviet Union, and to use Australia as a base for aggression, means the loss of national independence, the deprivation of people's freedom, and the decline of people's lives for the Australian people!

　　The facts most ruthlessly prove that U.S. monopoly capital is increasingly expanding its territory in Australia, especially concentrating its efforts on controlling its basic economic sectors. Eighty-seven U.S. monopoly capital companies have branches in Australia, controlling important automobile, petroleum, and slaughtering industries, and the total investment has exceeded that of the United Kingdom. The policy followed by the Australian reactionary government is precisely to allow its Wall Street masters to occupy its economic lifeline and its government. This disastrous consequence is the severe economic crisis in Australia today! This makes it impossible for the Australian working people not to rise up one after another to fight for the right to work and livelihood security.

　　Now the Australian reactionary government is further demonstrating its loyalty to the United States, echoing the United States' criminal act of illegally sentencing U.S. Communist leaders to prison, and also persecuting the Australian Communist Party, which defends peace and defends the people's democratic rights. This clearly tells us that in the war camp headed by the United States, including the rule of the Australian reactionary government, opposition to war is slandered as "illegal," and opposition to infringing on people's rights is slandered as "treasonous." Its "freedom" is only given to the handful of imperialist running dogs and lackeys who are beneficial to the war-mongering plot. This reactionary ruling machine that destroys people's opinions and persecutes progressive activities will inevitably be completely crushed under the iron fists of the people's united struggle.

　　British Communist Party General Secretary Pollitt and the British working class have joined forces with the strike demonstrations of the working people in various parts of Australia to lodge a strong protest with the reactionary Chifley government! They advocate immediately rescinding this tyrannical verdict! The people of our People's Republic of China extend a warm hand of support to Sharkey and his comrades-in-arms, and strongly protest this reactionary "verdict" of the Australian reactionary government. We will continue to relentlessly expose the plots of the United States and its reactionary lackeys in various countries to provoke a new war, and unite with the world's forces for peace and democracy to repel their attacks on the people. We have the confidence and the strength to repel them!

　　（二）抗议澳反动政府迫害夏基
    八个月以前法共领袖多列士谴责帝国主义反苏战争阴谋，号召保卫世界和平的声明，成为汹涌澎湃于全世界的保卫和平运动的号角。爱好和平的世界人民一致坚决地宣誓：“决不参加反对苏联的战争！决不为反苏战争制造一滴油！决不为反苏战争出一个人！”这一号召和由此所兴起的雄伟有力的反应，给予了帝国主义战争阵营以迎头一棒。
    澳共总书记夏基，本年三月五日，曾代表澳洲的劳动人民发表声明，支持多列士声明，并说：“苏联是爱好和平的国家，她不会对任何国家宣战，苏联只有在她自己受攻击时才会起而迎战。”声明又坚决地说：“如果苏军在追赶侵略者时来到澳大利亚，澳洲工人阶级就会欢迎他们，正如欧洲人民被苏军解放时欢迎苏军一样。”这一声明包括着颠扑不破的真理，包括着全世界爱好和平人民的期望。但正是这个代表澳洲人民一致利益的声明敲痛了依赖美帝压榨人民的澳洲反动政府的疮疖，夏基乃被“联邦特种法庭”以“发表叛国言论”为“罪名”而判以三年徒刑。
    这个可耻的判决，给我们说明了帝国主义及其奴仆的法律逻辑是个什么东西！夏基声明反对侵略战争，而澳洲反动政府正是美帝发动侵略战争的爪牙！夏基声明反对北大西详侵略公约，而在太平洋中的澳洲反动政府正是“北大西洋公约”圈套中豢养的小喽＠！澳大利亚反动政府就是这样公开无耻地将澳洲卷入美帝一手组织的反苏战争罪恶计划中的！
    我们从夏基的声明中所见到的真理，却成了右翼工党政府迫害共产党人时所引以为据的“罪状”。然而，人民的眼睛是雪亮的，他们知道：向爱好和平的苏联发动侵略战争，并且以澳大利亚为侵略根据地的帝国主义阴谋计划，对澳洲人民来说，正是意味着民族独立的丧失、人民自由的被剥夺、人民生活的下降！
    事实最无情地证明了，美国独占资本正愈来愈扩大它在澳洲的地盘，尤其集中力量操纵其基本经济部门。美国独占资本已有八十七家在澳洲设有分公司，控制了重要的汔车、石油、屠宰等业，投资总额已超过了英国。澳大利亚反动政府所遵循的政策，正是使它的华尔街主子占有了它的经济命脉，也占有了它的政府。这一灾难性的恶果，就是今日的澳大利亚严重的经济危机！这就使澳洲的劳动人民不能不前仆后继地起来，为争取工作权利及生活保障而斗争。
    现在澳洲反动政府则又进一步的向美帝效忠，和美帝非法判处美共领袖徒刑的罪恶行动相呼应，也迫害保卫和平、保卫人民民主权利的澳共。这就显明地告诉我们，在以美帝为首的战争阵营里，包括澳洲反动政府的统治在内，反对战争就被诬为“非法”，反对侵犯人民权利就被诬为“叛国”，它的“自由”只给予那些与挑拨战争阴谋有利的少数帝国主义的走狗奴仆。这种摧残人民舆论迫害进步活动的反动统治机构，必将在人民团结斗争的铁拳下彻底被击碎。
    英共总书记波立特及英国工人阶级已经和澳洲各地的劳动人民的罢工示威行动联合一致，向反动的齐佛莱政府提出强烈的抗议！主张立即取消这一横暴的判决！我们中华人民共和国的人民，谨向夏基和他的战友们伸出热诚支援的手，向澳大利亚反动政府强烈抗议这一反动“判决”，我们决将继续无情地揭露美帝及其各国的反动奴仆们挑拨新战争的阴谋，并与世界和平民主力量团结一致，击退它们向人民的进攻。我们有信心而且有力量击退它们！
