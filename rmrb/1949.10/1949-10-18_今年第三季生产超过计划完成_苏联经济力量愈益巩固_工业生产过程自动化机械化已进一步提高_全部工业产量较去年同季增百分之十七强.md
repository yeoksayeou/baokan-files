Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 17th: TASS, Moscow, October 14th: The Central Statistical Bureau of the Council of Ministers of the USSR has released a communique on the results of the implementation of the State Plan for the Restoration and Development of the National Economy of the USSR in the Third Quarter of 1949. The communique declares that the development of industry, agriculture, and transportation in the third quarter of 1949, the expansion of basic construction projects and trade, and the improvement of the people's material and cultural standards can be demonstrated by the following figures:

(1) Industry: The percentage of fulfillment of the production plan for total industrial output in the third quarter of 1949 by various ministries is as follows: Ministry of Ferrous Metallurgy 102, Ministry of Coal Industry 102, Ministry of Petroleum Industry 105, Department of Power Stations 99.8, Ministry of Chemical Industry 105, Ministry of Electrical Industry 104, Ministry of Heavy Machine Building Industry 107, Ministry of Automobile and Tractor Industry 103, Ministry of Machine Tool Building Industry 104, Ministry of Machine and Tool Manufacturing Industry 100.4, Ministry of Construction and Road Building Machine Manufacturing Industry 99.5, Ministry of Transport Machine Building Industry 100, Ministry of Agricultural Machine Building Industry 98, Ministry of Light Industry of the USSR 107, Production Cooperative 104.

As in the first half of this year, the government implemented various measures in the third quarter of 1949 to further improve the organization of production, first and foremost improving the utilization of productive forces, and saving raw materials, fuel, and supplies. As a result, the government raised the original industrial output plan. The entire Soviet industry completed 102% of the increased total output plan for the third quarter of 1949. The increased industrial output plan for the entire first nine months of 1949 has also been exceeded. In the third quarter of 1949, a huge amount of industrial products were produced in excess of the plan. The production plans for total output and most major product items have been successfully completed, but some ministries have not completed the production plans for certain important items.

(2) Increase in Industrial Output: The percentages of production of the most important industrial product items in the third quarter of 1949, compared with the third quarter of 1948, are as follows:

　　Pig iron 119, steel 124, rails 192, coal 114, oil 116, benzene 112, electricity 118, mainline electric locomotives 271, large trucks 128, passenger cars 223, ball bearings 131, spinning machines 147, looms 165, tractors 154, synthetic rubber 133, tires 148, prefabricated houses 152, radio sets 162, linen 122, woolen fabrics 115, silk fabrics 128, leather shoes 115, sausages 142, fish products 131, sugar 194, canned food 126.

The total industrial output of the Soviet Union in the third quarter of 1949 increased by 17% compared with the third quarter of 1948; the total industrial output of the entire first nine months of 1949 increased by 20% compared with the same period last year.

In the third quarter of 1949, much work has been done in all sectors of the national economy to adopt advanced technologies, further improve the level of mechanization in difficult and laborious work, and further improve the level of automation of production processes. The utilization of industrial equipment has also been improved. In the first nine months of 1949, the utilization of the effective capacity of blast furnaces in enterprises of the Ministry of Ferrous Metallurgy increased by 7% compared with the same period last year, while the steel output per square meter of Martin furnace hearth increased by 11%.

In the third quarter of 1949, the productivity of coal-cutting machines on coal faces in enterprises of the Ministry of Coal Industry increased compared with the third quarter of 1948, but the rate of increase in the output of coal-cutting machines in the machine-building industry is still lagging behind the plan. The utilization of production capacity in the petroleum, chemical, and other industries has increased. Some industrial sectors, particularly the machine-building industry, have enormous potential that can be utilized to further improve equipment.

In the first nine months of 1949, the consumption of raw materials, fuel, and electricity per unit of output in many industrial sectors was lower than the original standard, resulting in the extra production of a huge amount of products.

In the third quarter of 1949, the quality of industrial products (including consumer goods) continued to improve, and the variety of products further increased.

The 1949 plan to reduce industrial production costs is being successfully implemented. In the process of implementing the plan, new possibilities for further reducing production expenditures were discovered, and as a result, the government increased the task of reducing production costs for several ministries.

Significant Improvements in Agricultural Technology
Grain Harvest Exceeds Pre-War Levels

　　今年第三季生产超过计划完成
  　苏联经济力量愈益巩固
    工业生产过程自动化机械化已进一步提高
    全部工业产量较去年同季增百分之十七强
    【新华社北京十七日电】据塔斯社莫斯科十四日讯：苏联部长会议中央统计局顷发表关于一九四九年恢复与发展苏联国民经济的国家计划第三季执行结果的公报。公报宣称：一九四九年第三季工业、农业和运输业的发展，基本建筑工程、贸易的扩大，与人民物质和文化水准的提高，可由下列数字表现出来：
    （一）工业方面：各部执行一九四九年第三季工业总产量生产计划完成的百分数如下：冶金工业部一○二，采煤工业部一○二，石油工业部一○五，动力站部九九·八，化学工业部一○五，电气工业部一○四，重型机器制造工业部一○七，汽车与拖拉机工业部一○三，母机制造工业部一○四，机器与工具制造工业部一○○·四，建筑与筑路机器制造工业部九九·五，运输机器制造工业部一○○，农业机器制造工业部九八，苏联轻工业部一○七，生产合作社一○四。
    正如在本年上半年一样，政府在一九四九年第三季实行了种种措施，进一步改进了生产的组织，首先改进了生产力的运用，并节省了原料、燃料和物资。结果，政府提高了原定的工业产量计划。苏联全部工业则完成了已提高过的一九四九年第三季总产量计划百分之一○二。整个一九四九年头九个月的提高过的工业产量计划也已超过。一九四九年第三季超计划多生产了巨大数量的工业品。总产量及大多数主要产品项目的生产计划已胜利完成，但某些部尚未完成某些重要项目的生产计划。
    （二）工业产量的增加：一九四九年第三季最重要工业产品项目的生产，与一九四八年第三季比较的百分比如下：
    铣铁一一九，钢一二四，铁轨一九二，煤一一四，石油一一六，苯一一二，电力一一八，干线电气机车二七一，大卡车一二八，客车二二三，球轴承一三一，纺机一四七，织机一六五，拖拉机一五四，人造橡皮一三三，汽车胎一四八，活动房屋一五二，无线电机一六二，亚麻布一二二，毛织品一一五，丝织品一二八，皮鞋一一五，香肠一四二，鱼品一三一，糖一九四，罐头食品一二六。
    苏联一九四九年第三季全部工业总产量与一九四八年第三季相较，增加了百分之十七；一九四九年头九个月全部工业总产量与去年同期相较，增加了百分之二十。
    一九四九年第三季，在国民经济一切部门中已做了许多工作以采用先进的技术，进一步提高了困难和费力的工作中的机械化水平，进一步提高了生产过程自动化的水平。工业设备的利用也已有改进。一九四九年头九个月中，冶金工业部各企业的鼓风炉有效容量的利用，比去年同期增加了百分之七，而马丁炉炉底每平方公尺的钢产量增加了百分之十一。
    在一九四九年第三季中，采煤工业部各企业煤面上切煤机器的生产率，已比一九四八年第三季增加了，但机器制造工业中切煤机器的出产率增加的速率，却仍落在计划之后。石油、化学等工业中生产能力的利用都已增加了。若干工业部门特别是机器制造工业部门，有着可利用以进一步改进装备的巨大潜力。
    在一九四九年头九个月内，许多工业部门每单位产量所消耗的原料、燃料与电力，都低于原订的标准，因而额外生产了巨大数量的产品。
    一九四九年第三季继续进一步改进了工业品（包括消费品）的质量，并进一步增加了产品的种类。
    一九四九年的减低工业生产成本计划正在胜利地执行中。在执行该计划的过程中，发现了再减低生产支出的新的可能性，结果，政府便增加了若干部的减低生产成本的任务。
    农业技术显著改进
  　谷物收获超过战前
    （三）农业方面：根据部长会议所属国家中央调查机关的调查，一九四九年谷物收获量大于一九四八年，并量过战前一九四○年的收获超。棉花、亚麻、大麻和向日葵的收成都比去年好，并已超过战前水平。甜菜的收获也大大超过去年。收获进行得比一九四八年好。至十月五日，集体农场、国营农场与个体农户六百万公顷面积的收获，超过去年同期的收获。本年冬季作物的播种，完成得更及时，并且是用改良了的农业技术方法播种的。
    至一九四九年十月五日，集体农场、国家农场与辅助农场的秋季耕地面积比去年同期多四百四十万公顷。
    集体农场工作的机械化水平已大为提高。一九四九年过去这一阶段中，机器与拖拉机站为集体农场田地所做的工作，比去年同期增加了百分之二十一。本年机器与拖拉机站的联合收割机在集体农场已收获了比一九四八年多百分之二十九的谷物。
    在履行党与政府关于发展集体农场牲畜公共饲养三年计划所指定的任务方面，至一九四九年十月一日，集体农场已组织了七万五千间牛、羊、猪与家禽饲养所。集体农场公共牲口的头数，从一九四八年十月一日至一九四九年十月一日，增加的情形如下：食用牛与乳牛增加百分之二○，猪百分之七六，绵羊与山羊百分之一三。集体农场家禽的数目，增加了百分之六十二。国家农场牲口头数增加的情形如下：食用牛与乳牛增加百分之一七，猪百分之五六，绵羊与山羊百分之一一。
    苏联欧洲部分草原与森林草原区集体农场、国营农场以及造林站，在执行森林防护带植造计划上，已获得了巨大的成就。一九四九年全年的森林防护带植造计划，已完成了百分之一○二，在面积达二十八万公顷以上的地区种了树木，并准备了五十四万公顷造林的地面。建立林木苗圃的计划已超过了百分之十一。
    （四）铁路、内河与海洋运输量的增加：在一九四九年第三季，铁路平均每日载运量总计划完成了百分之一○○·九。比一九四八年同季增加了百分之十七。铁路货运较去年同期增加很多，而一九四八年此项运输就超过了战前一九四○年的水平。
    一九四九年第三季，内河货运较一九四八年同季增加了百分之十八，而本季的计划则完成了百分之一○一。一九四九年第三季的商船货运较一九四八年同季增加了百分之十，虽然本季此项运货计划还有百分之五没有完成。
    （五）国民经济基本建筑工程的增加：一九四九年头九个月里，全部基本建筑工程总量为一九四八年九个月的百分之一二二。建筑工作所获得的挖掘机、水泥混合机及其他建筑用机器与设备较去年同期增加很多。
    （六）贸易的扩大：一九四九年第三季国家与合作社的零售贸易较一九四八年同季的零售贸易（以比较价格计算）增加了百分之十八。
    一九四九年第三季，食品的销售较一九四八年同季增加了百分之十五，香肠增加了百分之六十，糖果百分之四十。食品以外货品的销售量增加特别大，较一九四八年同季增加了百分之二十三。毛织品百分之七十一，丝织品百分之五十五，无线电机百分之七十，摩托脚踏车百分之二十，脚踏车百分之七十，表增加两倍，留声机百分之五十七。
    一九四九年第三季中，集体农场市场上的农产品价格继续下降，而质量则提高了。
