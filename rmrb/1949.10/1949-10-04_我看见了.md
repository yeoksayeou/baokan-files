I Saw It
　　The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference decided on the capital, the national flag, and the national anthem, these are three major events.
　　In the capital, the newspapers published larger characters again, increased the number of pages, and added a brilliant new five-star national flag to the top of the newspaper stand. Newspaper vendors shouted: "Look! Come see the new national flag, the new national anthem!" "See today's newspaper for good news!" There were so many people in front of the newspaper stands that they were crowding each other. Yangko drums and gongs resounded to the heavens, coming from afar, approaching in teams. "Look! They're coming from the east!" "Look! They're coming from the west!" "Look! They're coming from the south!" From all directions, they were twisting, jumping, carrying colorful plaques in front, holding high red five-star lanterns and hammers, axes, sickles, shovels, waving small celebratory flags and the new national flag. In those teams of workers and students, they were singing, dancing, each dressed in various costumes, dressed as all kinds of people: workers, peasants, soldiers, students, merchants. At the crossroads, adults and children were running, shouting wildly, welcoming the celebratory teams. Everywhere was crowded with people, traffic and public security personnel, smiling and kindly persuading them to open up, picking up every child running around, they were busy maintaining traffic order, constantly wiping the sweat from their faces.
　　The crowded people were smiling, pointing, "This is our team!" Whenever the flag or colorful plaque at the head of the team appeared, it was followed by applause. When the teams shouted: "Down with bureaucratic capitalism!" "Down with feudalism!" "Down with imperialism!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" they also shouted along. People on bicycles stood on their bikes, they all waved and laughed like children. I saw a real "ten thousand people empty the streets," from the time the sky barely dawned in the morning until the night when the streets were illuminated by red lanterns, they were still dancing and singing.
　　I seemed to hear Chairman Mao's voice, coming from mid-air. I seemed to hear: "The people of the whole city are gathered on the streets to celebrate!"
　　It was a ray of red light, emitted from Beijing, enveloping the whole of China, illuminating everyone's heart.
　　After the People's Political Consultative Conference victoriously decided on the national anthem, the national flag, and Beijing becoming the new capital of new China, I saw the frenzied joy of the people of Beijing, the people of the whole country.

　　我看见了
    人民政协决定了国都、国旗、国歌，这是三件大事。
    在首都，报纸又刊出了大号的字，增了版，报牌的顶上，多了一张辉煌的崭新的五星国旗。卖报人高呼着：“看！来看新的国旗，新的国歌！”“看今天报纸的好消息！”报牌前，人多得互相拥挤着。秧歌锣鼓喧天价地，从远处传来，一队一队走近了，“看！东边来了！”“看！西边来了！”“看！南边来了！”四面八方，都是扭着、跳着、头前撑着彩牌，高擎着红五星的灯和铁锤、斧头、镰刀、铁铲，摇着庆祝的小旗和新的国旗，在那些工人、学生的队伍里，他们唱着、舞着，一个个穿了各式服装，扮成各种各样的人：工农兵学商。十字街头，大人小孩都在跑着、狂呼着，迎着庆祝的队伍。到处挤满了人，交通和公安人员，笑着和蔼的劝开，抱开每一个乱跑着的小孩，他们忙碌地在维持着交通秩序，不住挥着脸上的汗珠。
    挤拥的人们笑着、指着，“这是我们的队伍！”每当队伍头前的旗帜或彩牌一露面，接着就是掌声四起。队伍高喊：“打倒官僚资本主义！”“打倒封建主义！”“打倒帝国主义！”“毛主席万岁！”的时候，他们也随着高喊。蹬车的站在车上，他们都似小孩子一样摇着手欢笑。我看见了真的万人空巷，从早上天一发白，直到夜晚满街红灯照耀的时候，还是舞着，唱着。
    我仿佛听到毛主席的声音，从半空传来。我仿佛听到：“全市人民都齐集到大街来庆祝哟！”
    是一缕红光，从北京发射，笼罩了全中国，照澈了每个人的肺腑。
    在人民政协胜利的决定了国歌、国旗，和北京成了新中国的新首都之后，我看见北京的人民、全国的人民，那种狂热的欢乐。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　九、二十九。
