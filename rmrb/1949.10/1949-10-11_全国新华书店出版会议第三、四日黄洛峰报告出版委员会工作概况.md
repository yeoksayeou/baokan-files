Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 10th: The National Xinhua Bookstore Publishing Work Conference continues. On the 5th of this month, the third day of the conference, Huang Luofeng, Director of the Publishing Committee of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, reported on the work of the Publishing Committee in the morning. The report stated: From the establishment of the Publishing Committee to the end of August this year, for more than six months, a total of 305 kinds of books were reprinted and newly typeset, totaling 21 million words, using about 25,000 reams of paper, and printing about 4.7 million copies. In addition, the North China Xinhua Bookstore printed more than 5.3 million copies of elementary school textbooks and about 350,000 copies of middle school textbooks in the mainland. The North China United Publishing House printed more than 1.6 million copies of elementary school textbooks and more than 270,000 copies of middle school textbooks, using about 30,000 reams of paper. The Publishing Committee unified the publishing work of the Party in the North China region and initially unified the versions of the Party's national publications. Huang Luofeng then reported on the work of Beijing and Shanghai in jointly organizing a joint publishing house with the industry to undertake the printing of textbooks. He pointed out that this is a new way to unite private publishing, and also a new form of joint public-private publishing, and that the work of uniting private publishing should be consolidated and developed. Huang Luofeng also reported on the plan to publish and distribute a large number of national magazines, calling on Xinhua Bookstores in various places to treat magazine distribution as a new political task. Huang Luofeng pointed out that the current publishing work still has problems such as insufficient planning, failure to pay attention to printing popular editions, and failure to pay attention to promoting reporting work. Finally, he talked about the issues of cadres and enterprise management, calling on cadres who have worked in the liberated areas for a long time and cadres who have worked in the Kuomintang-controlled areas for a long time, workers and peasants and intellectuals, veteran cadres and new cadres, revolutionary staff and retained old personnel to strengthen unity, unite under the leadership of the Party, and unite under the highly revolutionary principles. He called for strengthening the spirit of enterprise, strengthening economic accounting, and conscientiously doing a good job in publishing work in a planned and step-by-step manner in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions.

The sixth, the fourth day of the conference, was chaired by Xu Boxin, director of the Shanghai-Nanjing Branch of the Publishing Committee, who reported on the revolutionary publishing work in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. He briefly described the history of the struggle of the revolutionary publishing industry in the Kuomintang-controlled areas over the past two decades, as well as the Kuomintang reactionaries' brutal persecution of revolutionary cultural publishing work. Revolutionary publishing workers, with Zou Taofen as their banner, struggled hard and sacrificed heroically, and constantly changed various forms of struggle, adhered to their posts, united progressive colleagues, established a solid united front in the publishing industry, and resolutely fought against the Kuomintang reactionaries. In areas where open struggle could not continue, they turned to secret forms of struggle. Then he described the process of how the Life, Reading, and New Knowledge three families gradually cooperated closely from independent operations and joint operations until they merged.

    六日为该会议第四日，由出版委员会沪宁分会主任委员徐伯昕报告国民党统治区的革命出版工作。他扼要地叙述了近二十年来国民党统治区革命出版事业的斗争历史，以及国民党反动派对革命文化出版工作穷凶极恶的摧残迫害。革命的出版工作者，以邹韬奋为旗帜，艰苦奋斗与英勇牺牲，并不断地变换各种斗争的方式，坚持岗位，团结进步的同业在一起建立了巩固的出版界统一战线与国民党反动派坚决斗争，在公开斗争不能继续的地区，就转入秘密方式的斗争。接着他叙述了生活、读书、新知三家怎样从独立经营协同作战，逐渐紧密合作，一直到合并的过程。
