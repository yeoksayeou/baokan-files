Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 3rd: Pittsburgh dispatch: Over one million workers in the United States are currently engaged in a large-scale strike. Following the strike of over 400,000 American coal miners which began on September 19th, the 513,000 workers of the United Steelworkers of America, affiliated with the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), also began striking at 0:01 (US time) on the 1st, in order to fight for workers' welfare funds. This is the first time in American history that coal and steel workers have struck simultaneously. According to the Associated Press, the steelworkers' strike has reduced US steel production by 95 percent. Government mediators acknowledge that there is no hope for an early resolution of the labor dispute. Canadian steelworkers passed a resolution on the 1st to do their utmost to support the striking American steelworkers. In addition, there are currently 110,000 railway, machinery, cotton picking, iron casting, sugar refining, leather, farm implement manufacturing, and aircraft manufacturing workers on strike. As for the strike of 2,000 dockworkers in Hawaii, it has persisted for over four months, and recently, they thwarted the local authorities' attempts to undermine the strike by using non-union members. On September 28th, they also prevented strikebreakers in Dallas Port (on the Columbia River bank in Oregon) from unloading goods loaded onto ships in Hawaii by non-union workers.

    加拿大钢铁工人决定尽力支援
    【新华社北京三日电】匹兹堡讯：美国一百余万工人正在进行大罢工。继九月十九日开始的美国四十余万煤矿工人罢工之后，美国产业工会联合会所属钢铁工人工会的五十一万三千工人，亦已于一日零时一分（美国时间）开始罢工，以争取工人的福利金。这是美国历史上第一次煤矿与钢铁工人的同时罢工。据合众社称：钢铁工人的罢工，使美国钢铁产量减少百分之九十五。政府调停人承认工潮无及早解决希望。加拿大钢铁工人一日已通过决定，尽力援助罢工的美国钢铁工人。此外，现在罢工中的尚有十一万铁路、机械、采棉、铸铁、制糖、皮革、农具制造和飞机制造工人。至于夏威夷的二千码头工人的罢工，迄今已坚持了四个多月，最近更击破了地方当局借助于非工会会员破坏罢工的企图。九月二十八日他们并在达拉斯港（在奥勒岗州哥伦比亚河岸）阻止了罢工破坏者卸下非工会工人在夏威夷装上船的货物。
