　　Shanghai Public Enterprise Streamlining and Thrift Campaign
　　Our Shanghai Correspondent Chao Qi
　　In response to the call of the East China Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party, public factories and enterprises in Shanghai began a streamlining and thrift campaign in August, and have achieved preliminary results. This movement has enhanced the workers' sense of ownership and increased their enthusiasm for production. In the past, the China Textile Corporation's bloated organization was a typical example of a bureaucratic enterprise. The company had twenty-six parallel units under the General Manager, with more than three thousand employees. Because there were too many redundant personnel, three or four people often did the work of one person. According to preliminary research, only four departments (namely, Engineering, Business, Finance, and General Affairs) and one office (Research) are needed to lead the production of various factories, and it is estimated that more than one-third of the employees can be streamlined. After learning about the call for streamlining and thrift, the company implemented democratic decision-making based on employee opinions, and after research and approval by higher authorities, it has initially streamlined more than ninety people. Appropriate arrangements have been made for the streamlined personnel. The China Textile Corporation's affiliated factories have also launched streamlining and thrift campaigns. The China Textile Fifth Printing Factory educated its employees by calculating accounts, so that everyone understood that the basic reason for the losses was the bureaucratic system caused by too many redundant personnel and loose organization. Therefore, employees have successively put forward requests to carry out reforms. Staff members, through self-reporting and public discussion, put forward opinions on streamlining, merging, and increasing work based on their own work. The factory has now completed the initial streamlining. After discussion by employees, the China Textile Sixth Factory has initially streamlined six people. Surplus workers from various departments have been adjusted and transferred to other jobs, with the spinning department reducing ten people and the weaving department reducing thirty-five people. The Public Transportation Company streamlined the original overlapping and nominally established units, changing the entire company from the original twenty-eight sections to thirteen sections; employees were streamlined from six hundred and forty to four hundred and fifty-one, and the surplus employees were organized for study.
　　The thrift campaign is combined with inventorying assets and actively producing, and all departments have achieved great results. For example, the China Textile Sixth Factory and Nineteenth Factory have been practicing thrift in everything from raw materials used for production to toilet paper for daily life, and have established a system of exchanging old for new. The Nineteenth Factory used 106 gallons of gasoline in August, saving 65 percent compared to April (the same below); tap water was saved by 49 percent; and electricity was saved by 31 percent. In addition, more than 470,000 copper pipes were inventoried. Due to the combination of thrift and production, the return waste of each yarn was reduced from 1.95 jin to 0.9 jin in July. All units of the East China Logistics Production Department launched a thrift campaign through study, and constantly criticized and educated individual wasteful elements during the campaign. The First Clothing Factory launched a competition between groups, classes, and individuals, and the production rate has been significantly improved. In the past, the fastest time to sew a jacket was one hour and twenty minutes, but now it averages one piece per hour, and the fastest is forty minutes per piece. All units under the Heavy Industry Department have also launched thrift campaigns, among which the Automobile Equipment General Office saved four-fifths of gasoline in August compared to July after stopping the use of transportation vehicles and official vehicles; and used more than 900 kilowatt-hours of electricity, a reduction of one-half compared to July. In particular, the Shanghai Postal Administration has reduced overdrafts by 700 million yuan since it vigorously implemented thrift and expanded its business, bringing revenue and expenditure closer to balance. In terms of clearing up assets, 34,000 kilograms of usable materials such as office paper and forms were found, which can be used by the entire bureau for five or six years. Facts have proved that the implementation of streamlining and thrift not only saves a lot of national currency, but also improves work efficiency and increases unity and mutual assistance among employees. After the personnel of the Wusong Gas Plant were streamlined, Yu Jingbo of the Secretary's Office alone did the work of three people in the past, including receiving and dispatching clippings and managing files. Employees of the China Textile Sixth Factory and Nineteenth Factory voluntarily spend one day a week going to the workshop to help workers clean, eliminating the past estrangement between employees.
　　In many departments, in-depth mobilization has been carried out for thrift and inventory work. For example, the China Textile Nineteenth Factory has deepened the mobilization work to every workshop; representatives from each production unit were selected to participate in the Inventory Committee to form a specialized leading organization. In each workshop, experienced veteran workers with high technical skills and supported by the workers were hired as consultants. This gave the workers a sense of being masters and brought out the workers' enthusiasm. During the inventory, many people forgot to eat and ignored enemy air raids. At that time, Shanghai was hit by a typhoon, and some workers' homes had been blown down by the typhoon, but they still braved the storm to take inventory. They said, "In the Kuomintang era, we only saw officials come to take over, but we had no share in it. Now we are taking inventory of our own property, what could be more important than this?" When the reporter visited the factory, worker Du Jinlong held a copper pipe in his hand and told the reporter: "This thing used to be scattered all over the place, but now everyone knows how to cherish their own things, and they pick it up immediately when it falls." After realizing that they were the masters of the country, the employees of the China Vegetable Oil Company's First Factory voluntarily established a production increase and thrift committee to strive for the factory to be self-sufficient and break even. Electricity consumption for lighting in the second half of August was 47 percent lower than in the second half of July, and the workers consciously searched for useful parts and materials in the scrap piles as if they were panning for gold.
　　On the contrary, some units failed because they did not rely on the workers' consciousness to implement streamlining and thrift. The lesson of the Zhaofeng Warehouse of the Materials Receiving Office is worth remembering. The water and electricity equipment of the warehouse was extremely wasteful, but the person in charge listened to the call for streamlining and thrift from the higher authorities, and went back without mobilizing the employees to study and discuss, and only discussed with two employees and decided to remove some electric lights and an electric stove, and subjectively stipulated that electric fans were not allowed to be used at all (the weather was very hot at the time). Because everyone did not realize the significance of thrift, the regulations were just regulations, and waste was still waste. The remaining electric stove was burning non-stop all day long. One that was cancelled was taken to the dormitory and burned secretly. The remaining electric lights were not turned off all night. When the person in charge was not at home, the two electric fans were all turned on. Therefore, the water and electricity bills for July did not decrease at all. Later, another comrade was transferred to work in the warehouse and corrected this bureaucratic approach, using accounting methods to get everyone to think and consciously formulate a thrift plan. As a result, water and electricity bills in August were 90 percent lower than in July.

　　上海公营企业的精简节约运动
    本报驻上海记者  超祺
    上海市各公营工厂及企业部门响应中共华东局的号召，从八月份开始，纷纷展开精简节约运动，现已获得初步成绩。在这一运动中，提高了工人的主人翁思想，增加了生产的积极性。过去中纺公司机构臃肿庞大实为官僚企业的典型。该公司在总经理之下，设有二十六个平行单位，职工三千余人。因为冗员过多，往往三四个人只做一个人的事。现据初步研究，只需四处（即工务、业务、财务、总务）一室（研究），就可以领导各厂生产，估计可以精简职工三分之一以上。该公司学习了精简节约的号召后，根据职工意见，实行民主决定，并经过上级的研究和批准，已初步精简九十余人。对被精简人员已作了适当的处理。中纺所属各厂，亦已展开精简节约运动。中纺五印厂以算帐方式教育职工，使大家了解亏本的基本原因是由于冗员过多，机构松懈的官僚制度所造成。因此职工纷纷提出进行改造的要求。职员以自报公议的办法，根据本身工作提出精简、合并、增加工作的意见。现该厂已完成初步精简。中纺六厂经过职工讨论，已初步精简了六人。并调整各部多余工友转派其他工作，计纺部减少十人，织部减少三十五人。公共交通公司将原来骈枝重叠挂名虚设的各单位精简，全公司由原二十八课改为十三课；职员由六百四十人精简为四百五十一人，将编余职员编组学习。
    节约运动和清点资财及积极生产相结合，各部均获得很大成绩。如中纺六厂及十九厂从生产用的原料到日常生活用的草纸，都厉行节约，并建立了交旧领新的制度。十九厂八月份用汽油一百零六加仑，比四月份（下同）节省百分之六十五；自来水节省百分之四十九；电节省百分之三十一。另外并清点出铜管子四十七万余个。由于节约与生产相结合，使每件纱的回丝由以前的一·九五斤减到七月份的○·九斤。华东后勤生产部各单位，通过学习展开节约运动，并在运动中不断批判、教育个别浪费分子。被服一分厂展开了组与组，班与班，个人与个人的竞赛，生产率显著提高。过去缝一件上衣最快是一小时又二十分钟，现平均每小时一件，最快的四十分钟一件。重工业处所属各单位亦都展开了节约运动，其中汽车器材总处自停驶交通车和公务车后，八月份用汽油较七月份节省五分之四；用电九百余度，较七月份减少二分之一。特别是上海邮政管理局自厉行节约展开业务后，八月份减少透支达七亿元，使收支接近平衡。并在清理资财上，检出办公用纸、表册等可用物资三万四千公斤，可供全局办公用五、六年。事实证明，实行精简节约的结果，不仅节省大量国币，且能使工作效率提高，增加职工间的团结互助。吴淞煤气厂人事精简后，秘书室余静波一人抵以前三人所做收发剪报管理档案诸事。中纺六厂、十九厂的职员每周自动抽一天时间到车间去帮助工人清洁打扫，消弭了过去职工间的隔阂。
    在很多部门里，对节约、清点工作进行了深入的动员，如中纺十九厂把动员工作深入到每一个车间；由各生产单位选出代表参加清点委员会，组成专门领导机构。在每一车间聘请技术高的且为工人所拥护的老工人作顾问。使工人有了作主人的感觉，发挥了工人的积极性。在进行清点的时候，许多人忘了吃饭，不顾敌机轰炸骚扰。那时正值台风袭上海，有的工人家已被台风吹塌了，仍冒着暴风骤雨来清点，他们说：“国民党时代，只见大官来接收，那有我们的份儿呢？现在是自己来清点自己的财产了，还有啥比这更要紧？”记者赴该厂参观时，工人杜金龙手里拿着一个铜管子告诉记者说：“这个东西以前遍地撒满了，现在大家都知道爱护自己的东西了，掉了马上拾起来。”中国植物油料公司第一厂职工，认识自己是国家的主人后，自动成立增产节约委员会，争取该厂保本自给。八月下半月电灯用电较七月份下半月节省百分之四十七，工人们自觉地象淘金似的在废料堆中翻寻有用的零件和材料。
    相反的，某些单位不依靠职工的自觉性来实行精简节约就遭受到失败。物资接管处兆丰仓库的教训值得记取。该仓库水电设备极为浪费，但该负责人听了上级精简节约的号召，回去不发动职工群众研究讨论，只是和两位职员商量了一下就决定把一部分电灯和一个电炉去掉，并主观规定完全不准使用电扇（当时天气很热）。因大家没有认识到节约的意义，结果规定自是规定，浪费仍是浪费。留下的一个电炉整日不停地烧着。被取消的一个则拿到宿舍里偷着烧。留下的电灯澈夜不关。负责人不在家的时候，二个电扇全开起来了。因此，七月份的水电费毫未减少。后来另一位同志调到该仓库工作，纠正了这种官僚主义的办法，用算帐方式，打通了大家的思想，自觉地订出节约计划。结果八月份水电费比七月份节约百分之九十。
