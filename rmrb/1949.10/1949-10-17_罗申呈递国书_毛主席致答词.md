At the time of presenting the credentials, I ask Your Excellency to believe that I will certainly strive to consolidate the happy friendly relations between the People's Republic of China and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The solid friendship between China and the Soviet Union is not only beneficial to the people of China and the Soviet Union, but also beneficial to world peace and international security. At the same time, I hope to obtain the assistance of Your Excellency and all officials of the government of the People's Republic of China in completing my mission. I congratulate Your Excellency and, through Your Excellency, the entire Chinese people on this historic victory—the founding of the People's Republic of China; this victory has opened up a broad path for China to move towards free and democratic development. I congratulate Your Excellency on your appointment as the head of your country. I wish Your Excellency good health and prosperity to the People's Republic of China."

Chairman Mao's reply was as follows:

"Ambassador Losovsky: I am very pleased to accept the credentials of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics presented by Your Excellency, and I sincerely thank Your Excellency for your congratulations. At the beginning of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet government took the lead in responding and expressing its willingness to establish diplomatic relations with our country. I believe that the friendship between China and the Soviet Union will grow stronger and more consolidated due to this decision by your government. I warmly welcome Your Excellency to serve as Soviet Union's first Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the People's Republic of China. I believe that through Your Excellency's efforts, the cooperation between our two countries will become closer, and at the same time, it will be conducive to jointly striving for lasting world peace. Here, I wish your country prosperity, your people thriving, and your head of state good health!"
