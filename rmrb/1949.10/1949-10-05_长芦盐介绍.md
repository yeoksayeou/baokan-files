Introduction to Changlu Salt

　　Changlu is located west of Cang County, Hebei Province, bordering the Bohai Sea. Because the soil contains alkali and is not suitable for planting, local residents mostly use seawater to make salt, making it a natural salt production area in North China. With changes in the terrain, the reclaimed land around Tianjin and Tanggu has become the central area of salt production, but the name Changlu Salt Area is still used. According to statistics from 1946, Changlu salt production accounted for 11.02% of the country's total salt production. Due to its large output and good quality, it sells well in major cities across the country and is well-known throughout the nation.

　　The Changlu Salt Area is divided into three natural salt fields: "Tangda," "Hangu," and "Daqinghe." The Tangda field governs four sub-districts: Tanggu, Xinhe, Denggu, and Dagu, with a total salt field area of 274 *fu* (referring to operating units; the size of a *fu* varies depending on the natural conditions and financial resources at the time of development. Some are as small as one *qing* in area, while others exceed ten *qing*); including 177 *fu* of publicly-operated salt fields (those taken over after the liberation from the China Salt Company) and 97 *fu* of privately-operated salt fields, covering a total area of 171,693.882 *mu*. The Hangu field governs four sub-districts under Hangu: Taohuakou, Shijiatuo, Xiaoshentang, and Beibao, with a total of 351 *fu* of salt fields; including 12 *fu* of publicly-operated salt fields and 339 *fu* of privately-operated salt fields, covering a total area of 130,435.542 *mu*. The Daqinghe salt field governs three sub-districts: Daqinghe, Dazhuanghe, and Langwokou, with 26 *fu* of salt fields, all of which are cooperative salt fields jointly operated by public and private entities, totaling 21,397.803 *mu*. The entire area has a total of 7,293 salt field workers (including technicians); 232 horsepower machines powered by electricity; 560 windmills; and 220 waterwheels.

　　Salt production varies from year to year, depending on the investment in equipment and the amount of labor used. The weather conditions, especially the balance of sunny and rainy days, also play an essential role in determining the increase or decrease in production. For example, if there are more sunny days than rainy days during the spring and autumn seasons, the output will be abundant; conversely, the output will be relatively reduced.

　　Since the liberation, production has increased. According to statistics at the end of June, the actual salt production of various salt fields in the past six months was 14,567,073 *dan*, which has greatly exceeded the original annual production plan (the original plan was 9,580,000 *dan*). This achievement is mainly due to the strong support of the government. In the past six months, the government has loaned a total of 4,163,570 *jin* of millet to various salt fields; the Cooperative Department of the Tianjin Branch of the People's Bank of China has also loaned 3,524,000 *jin* of millet to various salt industry guilds; and the Tangda Office of the People's Bank of China has issued 10 million yuan in short-term credit loans. This has enabled the spring salting to proceed smoothly and has also solved various expenses for autumn salt transportation and storage. The workers' lives have been adequately guaranteed, and the concerns of salt capitalists who were afraid of struggle and dared not develop production have also been eliminated.

　　Changlu salt is sold under the unified leadership of the Changlu Salt Industry Company, which is affiliated with the North China Trade Corporation. Sales are carried out in a planned manner by various branch companies. In the past six months, a total of 2,098,676 *dan* have been sold in North China, 301,949 *dan* have been sold in other liberated areas, 300,000 *dan* have been exported, and the salt directly sold by the Changlu Salt Bureau has been added, for a total of 3,995,678 *dan* sold.

　　Judging from the above production and sales situation, the sales of Changlu salt in the first half of the year is less than a quarter of the output. If the salt stored from last year is added, the inventory is very alarming. How to expand the sales of Changlu salt and solve the current problem of overproduction has become an urgent task.

　　长芦盐介绍
    长芦位居河北沧县之西，濒临渤海。因土质含碱不宜种植，当地居民多引海水制盐，为华北天然产盐区。随着地形的变迁，目前津沽一带的退海地已成为产盐之中心地带，但仍沿用长芦盐区之称。据民国三十五年统计，芦盐产量占全国盐产量的百分之十一·○二，因其产量大，质量好，故畅销全国各大中城市，驰名全国。
    长芦盐区，分为“塘大”，“汉沽”及“大清河”三自然盐场。塘大场管辖塘沽、新河、邓沽、大沽等四个分处，共有盐田面积二七四副（是指经营单位而言，一副滩之大小，随着当时开辟的自然条件和财力的限制，并不一致。小者一顷面积，大者有超出十顷者）；内公营滩（解放后接收中盐公司之滩）一七七副，私营滩九七副，共占面积一七一、六九三点八八二市亩。汉沽场管辖汉沽所属之桃花口、施家坨、小神堂、北堡等四个分处盐田共三五一副；内公营滩一二副，私营滩三三九副，共占面积合一三○、四三五点五四二市亩。大清河盐场管辖大清河、大庄河、浪窝口等三个分处盐田二六副，纯系公私合营之合作滩，计合二一、三九七点八○三市亩。全区总计盐滩工人（包括技术工人）七、二九三人；利用电力开动的马力机有二三二架；风车五六○座；水车二二○座。
    盐产量各年不同，一方面要看投资设备及使用人工多少而定；另一方面气候阴晴亦是决定产量增减的必要条件之一。如春晒秋驳两季节中，晴天多于雨天，产量则丰；反之，产量相对减缩。
    解放后，产量提高，据六月底统计，半年来各滩实产盐一四、五六七、○七三担，已大大超过原订年产计划（原计划为九、五八○、○○○担）。这一成绩的获得，主要是由于政府的大力扶助。半年来政府共贷给各盐场小米四、一六三、五七○斤；人民银行天津分行合作部又分贷各滩业公会小米三、五二四、○○○斤；人民银行塘大办事处发放短期信用贷款一千万元。这样就使盐区春晒得以顺利进行，同时也解决了秋驳入坨之各项费用。工人的生活有了适当的保证，盐业资本家害怕斗争，不敢发展生产的思想顾虑也因而消灭了。
    芦盐是在华北贸易总公司所属长芦盐业公司统一领导下来销售的。由各分公司有计划的掌握进行，半年来，华北各地共销二、○九八、六七六担，其他各解放区销三○一、九四九担，出国三○○、○○○担，再加上长芦盐管局直接推销的盐，合计共销三、九九五、六七八担。
    从上述产销情况来看，上半年芦盐的销售尚不足产量的四分之一，若再加上去年坨存盐斤，存数非常惊人。如何扩大芦盐的销售，解决当前生产过剩的问题，已成为当前迫不急待的任务。
