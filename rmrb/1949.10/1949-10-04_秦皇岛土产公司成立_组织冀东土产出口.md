　　Qinhuangdao Native Produce Company Established
   　Organizing Hebei Eastern Native Produce Exports
    [Baoding Electric] The preparatory office of the Qinhuangdao Native Produce Branch Company has been established and is starting to purchase rural native produce from various counties in eastern Hebei for export. Eastern Hebei is extremely rich in native products of many kinds. Fresh fruits include: pears from Changli, Zunhua, and Qian'an; red haws from Zunhua; persimmons from Miyun, etc. Dried fruits include walnuts from Qianxi, Linyu, Changli, Zunhua, etc., and chestnuts from Zunhua and Qianxi alone, with an annual output of approximately 6.7 million jin. Honey dates from Zunhua and Yutian, and apricot kernels from Qian'an, are also produced in large quantities. In the past, these native products were not only sold to Tianjin, Shanghai, and northeastern cities, but also to Hong Kong, Japan, and other places. In addition, rural by-products such as mats from Yutian and Ninghe, brooms from Leting, maotou paper from Qian'an, flax from Zunhua, mulberry branches from Qian'an and Funing, and raw silk from Qianxi and Linyu are exported in large quantities every year and are a major source of income for farmers. In recent years, exports have stagnated, greatly reducing farmers' income, and the output of native products has also been greatly reduced as a result. With the successive liberation of major cities and the gradual restoration of transportation, the establishment of the Native Produce Branch Company provides great convenience to farmers. In the future, the rural native products of eastern Hebei will achieve rapid development.

　　秦皇岛土产公司成立
   　组织冀东土产出口
    【保定电】秦皇岛土产分公司筹备处业已成立，正开始收购冀东各县农村土产办理出口。冀东各县土产极丰，种类亦多，鲜果类有：昌黎、遵化、迁（安）西的梨，遵化的红果，密云的柿子等；干果类仅迁西、临榆、昌黎、遵化等地的核桃及遵化、迁西的栗子两项年产即约达六百七十余万斤，遵化、玉田的蜜枣及迁安的杏仁，也出产很多。上述土产过去不仅运销津、沪及东北等城市，还行销到香港、日本等地。此外农村副产如玉田、宁河的席，乐亭的扫帚，迁安的毛头纸，遵化的线麻，迁安、抚宁的桑条，迁西、临榆的生丝，每年也有大宗出口，是农民收入主要来源之一。近几年来出口陷于停滞状态，大大减少了农民收入，同时土产的产量也因而大为缩减。目前各大城市相继解放，交通逐渐恢复，土产分公司的成立，给农民以极大便利，今后冀东农村土产，将会获得飞跃发展。
