Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 12th—TASS Moscow dispatch: On the 11th, *Pravda* published an editorial entitled "The German People Take a Step of Great Importance," which reads in part: October 7, 1949—the day the German Democratic Republic was proclaimed—will be recorded in the annals of the German people as the most important milestone on the road of the German people's struggle for a democratic Germany and its development.

The broad masses of people in all countries congratulate the establishment of the German Democratic Republic with the deepest satisfaction. The establishment of the German Democratic Republic is in line with the persistent demands constantly put forward by the broadest sections of the people in the Soviet and Western occupied zones of Germany.

The increasingly developing people's movement to establish a German democratic government vividly reflects the German people's desire to unite their democratic forces to strive for a unified, peace-loving, and democratic country.

This people's movement reflects the concerns of all upright German patriots about the fate of their motherland, which has been divided in two by the divisive policies pursued by the imperialist countries of the Anglo-American bloc.

The proclamation of the occupation statute in the West German occupied zone, in order to determine a long-term occupation system, not only signifies the destruction of the conclusion of a peace treaty, but also turns West Germany into a fiefdom of foreign imperialism. The restoration of the unbridled revenge-seekers, the Hitlerites of yesterday, and the Ruhr industrial giants to power only shows the reconstruction of the dark forces of reaction and the revival of fascism. The ongoing preparations to include the West German puppet state in the North Atlantic aggressive pact show that the Anglo-American warmongers regard West Germany as their strategic springboard and the German people as cannon fodder for implementing their aggressive plans.

The German policy pursued by the Anglo-American bloc of countries is a series of major violations of the Potsdam Agreement. The policy of division and dismemberment of Germany pursued by the Western countries headed by the United States reached its climax with the establishment of the Bonn bastard "government" and the promulgation of the occupation statute.

As we all know, before the Second World War, the US, British, and French imperialist blocs formulated plans to incite a German-Soviet war. At present, an alliance has once again been concluded between American monopolists and Ruhr industrial giants. The Anglo-American people, who seek world hegemony, are once again trying to restore German aggression and use it in the anti-Soviet and anti-people's democratic countries war they are preparing. But while continuing their sinful gambles, US and British imperialism does not take into account the fundamental great changes that have taken place throughout the world, including in Germany. The imperialist camp is opposed by a strong peace and democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union.

The editorial points out that the Soviet Union firmly and consistently abides by the Potsdam Agreement. The policy of eliminating militarism and Nazism, destroying the power of cartels, and eliminating all hotbeds of fascism has created the liberation and growth of the democratic forces of the German people and the regeneration of the German people for a new constructive life. The Soviet Union not only facilitated the democratization of Germany, but also strived to resolve the issue of a peace treaty with Germany as soon as possible. Similarly, the Soviet Union has always firmly opposed the dismemberment of Germany.

The editorial said: The Soviet Union's policy towards Germany has been supported by all sincere advocates of peace, especially the people's democratic countries. The broad people's movement that has unfolded in Germany and led to the establishment of the German Democratic Republic clearly shows which side the majority of the German people stand on in terms of emotions and desires. In their emotions and desires, their eyes are looking at the camp of peace and democracy. The German people are unwilling to become mercenaries of the Anglo-American warmongers. The German people are willing to be the masters of their own destiny and concentrate their efforts to strive for peace and the fastest transformation of the whole of Germany into a peaceful and democratic country.

*Pravda* stated: The proclamation of the German Democratic Republic is of unparalleled importance for the future path of the German people. It marks the German people's intensified struggle for the democratic freedom of their motherland, to eliminate its division, and to transform the entire Germany into a peace-loving and democratic country. The proclamation of the German Democratic Republic also has great international significance. Its establishment is a serious blow to the sinister plans of the warmongers (who dream of restoring the hotbed of German aggression) and strengthens the camp of advocates of peace and democracy.

### 德国人民采取有巨大重要性的一步

　　德国人民采取有巨大重要性的一步
    【新华社北京十二日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：十一日，真理报以“德国人民采取有巨大重要性的一步”为题，发表社论略称：一九四九年十月七日——德意志民主共和国宣布成立的日了——将记入德国人民的史册，成为德国人民争取民主德国的斗争和其发展道路上最重要的里程碑。
    一切国家广大人民以最深深的满意庆贺德意志民主共和国的建立。德意志民主共和国的建立，符合苏占区与西占区德国各界最广泛的人民所不断提出的坚持要求。
    日益发展的建立德国民主政府的人民运动，生动地反映出德国人民团结他们的民主力量为争取统一、爱好和平和民主的国家而斗争的愿望。
    这个人民运动反映了一切正直的德国爱国人士对于他们祖国命运的忧虑，他们的祖国已因英美集团帝国主义国家所从事的分裂政策而被分裂为二。
    西德占领区占领法规的宣布，是为了确定长时间的占领制度，这不仅表示破坏缔结和约，而且是将西德变为外国帝国主义的封地。恢复肆无忌惮的复仇分子、昨日的希特勒分子与鲁尔工业巨头当权，只是表明重建反动派黑暗势力的统治及复活法西斯主义。现在进行中的将西德傀儡国家包括到北大西的侵略公约范围内的准备工作，表明：英美战争贩子视西德为他们的战略跳板，视德国人民为实行他们侵略计划的炮灰。
    英美集团国家所从事的对德政策，是对波茨坦决议的一连串的极大破坏。由美国为首的西方国家所从事的分裂和肢解德国的政策，在成立波恩杂种“政府”及颁布占领法规时达到了极点。
    众所周知，在第二次世界大战以前，美、英、法帝国主义集团即制订计划，意欲煽起德、苏战争。目前在美国垄断资本家与鲁尔工业巨头之间，又已再次缔结同盟。谋求世界霸权的英美人士，再一次地力图恢复德国侵略，并在他们所正在准备的反苏和反人民民主国家的战争中利用它。但美英帝国主义在继续进行他们的罪恶赌博时，却不考虑已在全世界包括德国在内所发生的基本大变革。帝国主义阵营遭到以苏联为首的强有力的和平阵线和民主阵营的反对。
    社论指出：苏联坚决而始终不渝地遵守波茨坦决议。肃清军国主义与肃清纳粹的政策，摧毁卡特尔的力量与扫除一切法西斯主义温床的政策，造成了德国人民民主力量的解放和生长，以及德国人民为着新的建设性生活而再生。苏联不仅便利了德国的民主化，而且力求尽早解决对德和约问题。同样，苏联一贯坚决反对德国的肢解。
    社论说：苏联的对德政策得到一切诚挚的和平拥护者，首先是人民民主国家的支持。已在德国展开并导向德国民主共和国成立的广大人民运动，清楚地显示了大多数德国人民在情感上和愿望上，是站在谁的一边。在他们的情感和愿望中，他们的眼光看着和平与民主阵营。德国人民不愿意成为英美战争贩子的雇佣兵。德国人民愿意成为他们自己命运的主人，并集中其努力以争取和平及最快地变全德为和平民主国家。
    真理报称：德国民主共和国的宣布成立，对于德国人民将来的道路具有无比巨大的重要性，它标志着德国人民为祖国民主自由消灭其分裂，和把整个德国变为爱好和平的民主国家而加紧斗争。德国民主共和国的宣布成立，同时具有巨大的国际意义。它的成立给战争贩子的罪恶计划以严重的打击，（这些战争贩子梦想恢复德国的侵略温床），并加强了和平与民主的拥护者阵营。
