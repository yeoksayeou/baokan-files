Xinhua News Agency, Central China Front, 16th: The People's Liberation Army's Second and Fourth Field Armies, surging towards Guangzhou, have fully demonstrated a high degree of unity, fraternity, and mutual assistance. When units of the Fourth Field Army passed through the station of a certain unit of the Second Field Army, the soldiers of the Second Field Army carried boiled water and lanterns to meet them several miles away, and gave up the houses that had been cleaned and the beds with mosquito nets hung, asking the brotherly units of the Fourth Field Army to rest. They pushed and yielded to each other, all vying to camp outside. On the march, two horses of a certain unit of the Fourth Field Army fell ill. The Second Field Army immediately sent a veterinarian to rush from seven or eight miles away in the rain to treat them, and introduced in detail the experience of treating horses. The various units of the Fourth Field Army, under the slogan of "Guarantee that the brotherly units eat their fill, walk well, and sleep well," have made very thorough plans and arrangements. A certain unit organized and mobilized the local people to clean up the houses in the camping area of the brotherly units of the Second Field Army, built high bunks, and set up a boiled water station and signposts every ten miles along the highway. Engineers also rushed to repair six bridges on the road ahead of the brotherly units of the Second Field Army. A certain unit also set up grain stations along the way to solve the difficulties of the brotherly units in terms of grain, firewood, vegetables, and fodder. Encouraged by this sincere class friendship, the morale of the various units of the Fourth and Second Field Armies in the march was extremely high, and the people along the way said in unison: "We have never seen such a close and united team. They are even closer than real brothers!".

　　比亲兄弟还亲！
  　二野四野团结互助进军广东
    【新华社华中前线十六日电】向广州汹涌挺进的人民解放军第二、第四两大野战军，充分发扬了高度的团结友爱与互助精神。当第四野战军部队途经第二野战军某部驻地时，第二野战军的战士们担着烧好的开水，提着灯笼，到数里以外相迎，并将已经打扫得干干净净的房子和挂好蚊帐的床铺让出，叫第四野战军兄弟部队休息。他们彼此互推互让，都争着要在外面露营。在行军途中，第四野战军某部的两匹马病倒了，第二野战军的部队立即派兽医从七、八里地外冒雨赶来医治，并详细介绍了治疗马匹的经验。第四野战军各部则在“保证使兄弟部队吃饱饭、走好路、睡好觉”的口号下，都做了很周密的计划和布置。某部组织和发动了当地人民，将第二野战军兄弟部队宿营地的房子打扫得干干净净，搭起高铺，并在公路沿途每隔十里设一开水站和指路牌，工兵亦在第二野战军兄弟部队的前进路上赶修桥梁六座。某部并在沿途设有粮站，为兄弟部队解决粮秣、柴草、蔬菜、草料等困难。在这种真挚阶级友情的鼓舞下，进军中的第四和第二野战军各部士气极为高涨，沿途人民也异口同声地说：“我们从来没有见过这样亲密团结的队伍，真比亲兄弟还亲哩！”。
