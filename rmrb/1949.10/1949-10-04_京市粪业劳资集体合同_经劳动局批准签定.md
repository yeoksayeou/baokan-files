　　Beijing Municipality Sewage Industry Labor-Management Collective Contract
  　Approved and Signed by the Labor Bureau
    [Beijing News] Following the signing of the construction industry collective contract, the Beijing Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau officially approved the "Beijing Municipality Sewage Industry Labor-Management Collective Contract" on the 30th of last month. This is the third labor-management collective contract signed in the city.
    The conference for signing and approving this collective contract was held at 9:00 AM on the 30th in the Labor Bureau's conference room. More than 30 representatives from both labor and management in the sewage industry, as well as representatives from the sewage industry trade union and the sewage industry trade association, attended. The municipal trade union also sent representatives. Before the meeting, labor and management representatives had further discussions and agreements, and finally revised the clauses in the contract. The Labor Bureau then read out the final revised full text of the contract at the meeting, which was unanimously approved by both labor and management with applause. Shi Huaibi, Director of the Labor Bureau, announced the formal approval on the spot and said: This contract was signed after four discussions and negotiations. It truly represents the interests of both parties and embodies the policy of benefiting both labor and management. For example, although workers' wages have been increased from 150 jin of millet to 350 jin, the management can still obtain 50% to 70% of the profits. Finally, he said: Since the contract was decided by everyone through several democratic discussions and negotiations, it is hoped that both labor and management will consciously abide by and implement it after the meeting. Subsequently, representatives from the labor side and the management side spoke successively, and the meeting adjourned successfully in warm applause.
