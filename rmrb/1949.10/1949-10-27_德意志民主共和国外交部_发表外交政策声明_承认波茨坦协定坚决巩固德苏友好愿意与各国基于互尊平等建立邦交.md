Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 26th: TASS, Berlin dispatch: On October 24th, Max Kehlson, head of the Information Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic Republic, read a statement issued by Foreign Minister Georg Dertinger to German and foreign journalists.

The statement said: "The Minister of Foreign Affairs, on behalf of the Provisional Government of the German Democratic Republic, issues the following statement to all national governments: On October 7, 1949, the German Democratic Republic was established in Berlin. On the same day, the Provisional People's Chamber announced that the Constitution passed by the Third German People's Congress on May 30, 1949, had come into effect. On October 11, 1949, Mr. Wilhelm Pieck was elected President of the German Democratic Republic. After Mr. Otto Grotewohl was appointed Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic on October 7, 1949, he presented the government he had formed to the Provisional People's Chamber on October 12, 1949, and delivered a government declaration. On the same day, the Provisional People's Chamber approved the organization of the government and the government declaration.

    This government declaration succinctly explains the basis of the policies of the Provisional Government of the German Democratic Republic. The government is fully willing to make its best efforts to restore unity on a democratic and peaceful basis. It seeks to conclude a peace treaty between the Allies and Germany as soon as possible. The Provisional Government of the German Democratic Republic fully recognizes the agreements on Germany jointly decided by the Allies, primarily the Yalta and Potsdam Agreements. The government is determined to fulfill all obligations imposed on the German people by these agreements for peace and international friendship. The guiding principle for all the tasks of the Provisional Government of the German Democratic Republic is to prevent the resurgence of German imperialism with predatory ambitions, and to establish peaceful and friendly relations between the German people and all other nations, especially the Soviet people. The Soviet government recognizes the national interests of the German people and has repeatedly defended and represented these interests.

    The German Democratic Republic has been recognized by the Soviet Union—whose weight in international relations is of decisive importance—and other countries. Diplomatic relations have been established between these countries and the German Democratic Republic. The Provisional Government of the German Democratic Republic strives to fulfill the promise of giving the German people the opportunity to rejoin the ranks of free and peaceful peoples, and takes this as its duty, striving to contribute to the cause of strengthening peace and the mutual friendly ties between our country and the peoples of all nations, as well as between all nations. Therefore, it believes that establishing such ties between the Provisional Government of the German Democratic Republic and every country willing to engage in normal diplomatic, economic, and other relations on the basis of mutual respect and equality is appropriate and urgently needed.

    Georg Dertinger, Minister of Foreign Affairs, on behalf of the Provisional Government of the German Democratic Republic
    Berlin, October 24, 1949."

　　德意志民主共和国外交部　
    发表外交政策声明            
    承认波茨坦协定坚决巩固德苏友好愿意与各国基于互尊平等建立邦交
    【新华社北京二十六日电】塔斯社柏林讯：十月二十四日，德意志民主共和国外交部新闻处处长马克斯·凯尔逊，向德国及外籍新闻记者宣读外交部长乔治·窦丁格尔所发表的声明。
    该声明称：“外交部长代表德意志民主共和国临时政府，向一切国家政府发出声明如下：一九四九年十月七日，德意志民主共和国在柏林成立。同日，临时人民议会宣布第三届德国人民代表大会于一九四九年五月三十日通过的宪法生效。一九四九年十月十一日，威廉·皮克先生被选为德意志民主共和国总统。奥托·格罗提渥先生在一九四九年十月七日被任命为德意志民主共和国总理以后，于一九四九年十月十二日向临时人民议会提出他所组成的政府，并发表政府宣言。同日，临时人民议会批准政府的组织和政府宣言。
    这一政府宣言扼要地说明了德意志民主共和国临时政府的政策的基础。政府完全愿意尽最大努力争取在民主与和平的基础上恢复统一。它力求尽早缔结盟国和德国之间的和约。德意志民主共和国临时政府完全承认盟国所共同决定的关于德国的协定，首先是雅尔塔和波茨坦协定。政府坚决为和平与国际友谊而履行这些协定所加诸德国人民的一切义务。德意志民主共和国临时政府对其一切任务的指导原则，是阻止具有掠夺野心的德国帝国主义的再起，并建立德国人民与一切其它国家人民特别是苏联人民间的和平友好关系。苏联政府承认德国人民的国家利益，并曾屡次保卫和代表这些利益。
    德意志民主共和国已为苏联——它在国际关系中的重量具有决定的重要性——以及其他国家所承认。这些国家与德意志民主共和国之间已建立了外交关系。德意志民主共和国临时政府力求实现给德国人民以再度跻身于自由与和平人民之列的机会的诺言，并以此为其职责，力求对于加强和平以及我国与一切国家人民间，以及一切国家间相互友好联系的事业有所贡献。因此认为：在德意志民主共和国临时政府和每一个愿意在互相尊重与平等的基础上发生正常外交、经济及其他关系的国家间，建立这种联系，是适当而且迫切需要的。
    代表德意志民主共和国临时政府外交部长乔治·窦丁格尔
    一九四九年十月二十四日于柏林。”
