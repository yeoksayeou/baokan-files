　　The Miners of Yongdingzhuang
　　The complete liberation of the Datong Coalfield occurred in February of this year. On September 13th, we – students from the Geology Department of Peking University – went to the Datong Coalfield for an internship, and we were fortunate to have the opportunity to learn from the miners.
　　The Yongdingzhuang mine is one of the eight major mines from the enemy-puppet era, and it uses entirely mechanized mining. Currently, there are over a hundred miners, producing more than two hundred tons of coal daily. They go down the mine at 7:00 AM, working eight hours a day, rotating in three shifts. Political study takes place from 5:00 PM to 6:00 PM, and the general learning enthusiasm is very high, especially concerning “Labor Creates the World.” A miner named Li Guojun said, “In the past, the reactionaries looked down on us, saying we depended on the boss for food. Now we understand that we were the ones who supported the boss, and everything in the world is created by the working people.” He then told me many stories of the struggles of the workers against the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang before liberation. He said, “Our wages aren't high now because we need to support the front lines, but things will get better in the future. The coal mine is our own, and we must work hard to produce.” Their high level of political consciousness makes us feel ashamed in comparison.
　　On the 15th, we went down into the mine to visit. They use the room and pillar method of coal mining. On both sides of the tunnels, there is a mining area every sixty *chi*. We entered one of the mining areas, where dozens of workers were swinging shovels and picks to dig coal. The coal was being stripped from the rock layers piece by piece; some were drilling holes in preparation for blasting. The night before, a miner told me, “In the past, the mine was the best place for us to slack off, and the supervisors were our mortal enemies.” But now there is no need for supervision anymore. Replacing the supervisors are the coal mining team leaders who solve their difficulties. They can tell the team leader their opinions, and often make proposals to the trade union. They have truly become the masters of the coal mine.
　　To solve the workers' difficulties in life, the trade union has specially established a consumer cooperative, providing various daily necessities at affordable prices. There is also an affiliated hospital to treat their illnesses free of charge.
　　When we arrived, they had just finished studying Chairman Mao's "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," which took them a month to complete, and they discussed it in great detail, especially focusing on connecting it to reality. They also held an oral question-and-answer exam. When we left Yongdingzhuang, they were preparing to start discussing the "White Paper."
　　The Datong Coal Mine Preparation Office has now taken over more than thirty large and small mines, and it is expected to restore the daily output to eight thousand tons next year. Under the correct leadership of the People's Government, and with the hard work of the miners, the Datong Coal Mine has a glorious future.

　　永定庄的矿工们
    大同煤田的全部解放，是在今年二月。九月十三日，我们—北大地质系同学前往大同煤田实习，得有机会向矿工们学习，真是一件幸事。
    永定庄矿厂，是敌伪时代的八大矿厂之一，全部用机器开采。现在有一百多个矿工，每日产煤二百余吨。他们上午七点钟下井，每天工作八小时，分三班轮流调换。下午五时至六时是政治学习，一般的学习情绪都很高，尤其对“劳动创世界”特别感到兴趣；一位名叫李国钧的矿工说：“从前反动派瞧咱们不起，说咱们靠老板吃饭，现在咱才明白，原来咱们养活了老板，世界上一切都是劳动人民创造出来的。”接着他还告诉我许多解放前工人们和蒋匪帮斗争的故事。他说：“现在咱们的工钱不算高，是因为要支援前线，将来是会好起来的，煤矿是咱们自己的，要努力生产。”他们的政治觉悟这样高，相形之下，真使我们觉得惭愧。
    十五日，我们下矿井参观。他们用的煤矿工程是场柱法，在坑道的两旁，每隔六十粎就有一个采煤场、其中我们进入一个采煤场，里面有几十个工人正在飞舞着铁锹、铁锥掘煤，煤一块一块的从岩层上剥离下来；有的是在开凿钻眼，准备放炮。头天晚上，一位矿工告诉我：“以前井下是咱们最好怠工的场所，监工是咱们的死对头。”而现在再也用不着监督了，代替监工的是为他们解决困难的采煤组长，有意见可告诉组长，经常向职工会提出。他们真正做了煤矿的主人了。
    职工会为了解决工人们生活上的困难，特地设立了消费合作社，平价供给各种生活用品。还有附属医院免费为他们治疗疾病。
    我们去到的时候，他们正学完了毛主席的“论人民民主专政”，前后花了一个月的工夫，讨论得很详细，特别着重在连系实际。他们还用口头问答的方式，举行过一次考试。我们离开永定庄的时候，他们又在准备开始讨论“白皮书”了。
    现在大同煤矿筹备处一共接管过来的大小矿厂有三十多个，预计在明年恢复日产八千吨的数目。在人民政府正确的领导下，在矿工们的努力生产下，大同煤矿是有着辉煌的前途的。
