    [Our Dispatch] Today, on the founding of the People's Republic of China, as the whole country solemnly celebrates the birth of the new China, our Chinese People's Air Force will appear with the most heroic posture above the heads of the two million citizens of the people's capital. They not only undertake the major task of guarding the people's capital, but will also receive the solemn review of the people's leader Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. They resolutely guarantee that they will make the greatest efforts to complete the task of defending the people's capital and participating in the grand review.
    This time, the People's Air Force is conducting work with great enthusiasm and tension for the purpose of guarding and defending the people's capital—Beijing, and arranging participation in the review. From the opening of the People's Political Consultative Conference to today, they have been working excitedly. Whether it is personnel in telecommunications, meteorology, command, or aircraft maintenance, everyone is constantly checking, and everyone guarantees to jointly complete this great task.
    The leading comrade of the flight team participating in today's review happily and resolutely expressed that they feel supremely honored to be able to participate in the task of protecting this historically unprecedented ceremony of the birth of the People's Republic of China. He resolutely said: We bravely undertake this task, and if the reactionaries dare to come, we must give them a resolute blow! Today, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, we will definitely build a strong Chinese People's Air Force!
