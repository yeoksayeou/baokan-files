　　Large Quantities of Grain and Cloth Allocated to Beijing
    Beijing Commodity Prices Return to Stability
    Speculative Attempts by Unscrupulous Merchants Suffer Blows
    [Beijing News] Since the Beijing Municipal People's Government resolutely implemented the resolution of the Beijing Municipal People's Representatives Conference on severely punishing unscrupulous merchants and stabilizing commodity prices, commodity prices in Beijing have not fluctuated greatly in August and September. In recent days, due to the increase in wheat prices in grain-producing areas such as Shijiazhuang and Baoding, and the arrival of Northwest merchants in Beijing to purchase yarn and cloth, the prices of grain, yarn, and cloth in Beijing rose slightly from October 6th and 7th to October 13th. However, due to the strong control of the market and the large supply of materials by state-owned trading departments such as the Beijing Branch of the North China Grain Company and the Beijing Branch of the North China Yarn and Cloth Company, commodity prices in Beijing did not fluctuate greatly. Yesterday (14th), commodity prices have returned to stability, and some grain prices have fallen. For example, yesterday's market price of flour remained stable, while Jingxi rice was 365 yuan per jin, a decrease of 5 yuan compared to the previous day (13th). The price of Fudi millet remained unchanged at 210 yuan. The price of yarn and cloth was also stable. Yesterday, Erchang Hong Wufu cloth remained stable at 36,300 yuan, and the speculative merchants' dream of stirring up commodity prices suffered another heavy blow. Recently, in order to supply Beijing's needs and control the market price of grain, the North China Grain Company has decided to allocate a large amount of grain to Beijing, including a large amount of wheat. As of yesterday (14th), 58 train cars of wheat, 15 train cars of Northeast red sorghum, and 15 train cars of corn, totaling more than 4 million jin, have arrived in Beijing, and the remaining grain will also be transported in continuously. From October 9th to 14th, the Beijing Grain Branch sold more than 2,768,300 jin of coarse grains and more than 2,342,600 jin of fine grains at the original price of the 8th. In order to supply Beijing's needs for cotton yarn, the Beijing Branch of the North China Yarn and Cloth Company has transported a large amount of cotton yarn and cloth from Tianjin. In addition to selling it in large quantities at the Dongcheng and Nancheng branch stores, it also sold cotton cloth in the cotton cloth markets of Bu Lu Zi, Da Heng Zhan, and Dong Xiaoshi. Since the 9th, the average daily sales have been three times higher than on the 8th. In the past, half of Beijing's weaving factories relied on the North China Yarn and Cloth Company for raw materials. Now, in addition to supplying raw materials to the original factories, the North China Yarn and Cloth Company is also transporting a large amount of yarn and cloth from Tianjin to supply market applications. In this way, not only the raw material difficulties of the factories have been solved, but also the unscrupulous merchants have been prevented from taking the opportunity to manipulate the market. At the same time, in order to meet the needs of government agencies and schools, a large number of gray and cyan-blue cloths have been dyed recently, ready for large-scale sales, so that government agencies, schools, and organizations can purchase them. Those who hold letters of introduction from various government agencies and schools, proving that they are indeed preparing for winter clothing, can enjoy a 1% discount on the listed price.

　　大批粮布调拨来京
    京物价复趋平稳
    奸商投机企图遭受打击
    【北京讯】自从北京市人民政府坚决执行京市各界代表会议关于严惩奸商，平抑物价的决议以来，北京市八、九两月物价均无大波动。近数日来，因石家庄、保定等食粮产地麦价上提，及西北商人来京采购纱布，致京市粮食、纱布等类物价从十月六、七日到十月十三日止稍有上涨，但是，由于华北粮食公司北京分公司和华北花纱布公司北京市分公司等国营贸易部门有力掌握市场大量供应物资，京市物价并无大波动。昨（十四）日物价已复趋平稳，一部粮食价格已回落。如昨日市场价格面粉平稳不动，京西大米每斤三百六十五元，比前（十三）日落五元。伏地小米价未动，仍为二百一十元。纱布价格亦平稳。昨日二厂红五福布平稳未动，仍为三万六千三百元，投机奸商掀动物价的妄想，至此又受一次沉重的打击。最近，华北粮食公司为了供应京市的需要及掌握食粮市价，已决定调拨大批食粮来京，其中包括大批小麦，至昨（十四）日已运抵京小麦五十八车，东北红粮十五车，玉米十五车，共约计四百余万斤，其余食粮亦将源源运来。自十月九日至十四日，北京食粮分公司依照八日原价售出粗粮二百七十六万八千三百余斤，细粮二百三十四万二千六百余斤。北京花纱布分公司为了供给京市棉纱的需要，已从天津运来大批棉纱与布匹，除在东城及南城两门市部大量出售外，并在布＠子、大恒栈、东晓市等棉布市场抛售棉布，自九日起平均每日较八日可多售三倍，过去京市二分之一的织布工厂的原料靠花纱布公司供给，现在花纱布公司除供给原工厂的原料外，更由天津运来大批纱布以供给市场应用。如此，不但解决了工厂的原料困难，又避免了奸商的乘机操纵。同时为了适应机关、学校的需要，近期已染妥大批灰色及青蓝色布，准备大量抛售，以便机关、学校、团体购买，凡持有各机关学校介绍信，证明确系为准备冬装者，可按牌价减价百分之一优待。
