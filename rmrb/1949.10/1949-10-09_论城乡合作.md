On Cooperation Between Urban and Rural Areas
    By Luhong

    "Mutual assistance between urban and rural areas" is an important part of Chairman Mao's policy of considering all aspects. To truly understand and implement this policy, we must understand the nature and characteristics of China's cities and rural areas, as well as their changing and developing processes. Only then can we grasp the correct guidelines for agricultural production, adapt to the needs of industry, ensure industrial production serves rural areas, and develop the national economy in a planned way. This book aims to provide readers with knowledge in this area.
