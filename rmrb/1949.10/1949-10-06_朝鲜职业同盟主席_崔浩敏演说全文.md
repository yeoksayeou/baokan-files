　　Full Text of Speech by Choi Ho-min, Chairman of the Korean Trade Union Federation
    【Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 5th】Choi Ho-min, Chairman of the Korean Trade Union Federation, delivered a speech at the founding meeting of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in China. The full text is as follows: Dear friends,
    I feel extremely honored to be able to participate in the founding meeting of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, which strengthens the eternal friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people. I extend warm congratulations to all of you present at the meeting and to the heroic Chinese people.
    Ladies and gentlemen, today all freedom-loving people around the world believe that forming an eternal friendly relationship with the Soviet Union is a guarantee of freedom and liberation. At the same time, their hearts are filled with gratitude to the world's peace fortress—the heroic Soviet people and their great leader, Marshal Stalin. Our love, respect, and trust for the Soviet people are steadfast, eternal, and indestructible, and no force can thwart them. This is because the Soviet Union is the true liberator of weak nations and the bastion of world peace; because the Soviet Union shines like the sun on the bright future of human society; because the Soviet Union is the country of the Soviet people who struggle for a new era of human happiness and freedom, regardless of all difficulties and sacrifices; because the Soviet Union is the country led by Marshal Stalin, the sun of mankind.
    Dear friends, thanks to the heroic struggle and noble blood of the great Soviet army, the Korean people were liberated from the long rule of the vicious Japanese imperialism. Furthermore, thanks to the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, we, the Korean people, rapidly restored and developed Korean national culture. Under these favorable conditions, we victoriously completed two one-year people's economic plans, and on this basis, we established our republic, and then carried out a new two-year people's economic plan to make the republic's economy and culture more prosperous and developed. In this way, the consolidated friendship between Korea and the Soviet Union, realized from liberation and assistance, has become stronger with each passing day, and the people's victory has also been increasingly strengthened.
    In the four years of practical life and experience since liberation, the Korean people have firmly believed that only through close cooperation with the Soviet Union and strengthening and developing the consolidated friendship between Korea and the Soviet Union can we strive for territorial sovereignty integrity and national freedom. This belief will be consolidated forever.
    Ladies and gentlemen, the heroic Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the wise people's leader Chairman Mao Zedong, have achieved a glorious victory of historical significance. The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association established today will play the role of a canal, exchanging the culture of China, which has a long history of five thousand years, with the great Soviet socialist culture. It will promote the cultural development of People's China, thereby promoting the greater victory of the Chinese people. It will be able to contribute valuable things in the struggle to eliminate all evil enemies in human society.
    Now is the time when the international reactionaries headed by the US-British imperialists and their lackeys are frantically provoking a new war. Strengthening the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people will surely give great encouragement to the people all over the world who are fighting for peace and democracy. Because today, the bright future of all mankind can only be obtained in friendship with the great socialist country, the Soviet Union. The happiness, freedom, and independence of peace-loving people and weak nations can only be obtained by strengthening friendship with the great socialist country, the Soviet Union, and by defending the friendship and iron-like unity among peace-loving and democratic people.
    We, the Korean people, can only foresee the light of its victory in the struggle to win the unification, independence, and national freedom of our motherland and oppose the US imperialism and its lackey, the traitorous Syngman Rhee clique, by strengthening the consolidated friendship and close cooperation with the heroic Soviet people led by the great Marshal Stalin and the victorious Chinese people led by Chairman Mao Zedong. Therefore, we extend our heartfelt congratulations to the historically significant Sino-Soviet Friendship Association born today, and I am convinced that its cause will surely achieve great success.
    Long live the founding meeting of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association!
    Long live the heroic Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong!
    Long live the eternal friendship between the Korean, Chinese, and Soviet people!
    Long live Stalin, the great leader, teacher, and sun of the working people of the world!

    崔浩敏演说全文
    【新华社北京五日电】朝鲜职业同盟主席崔浩敏在中国中苏友好协会成立大会上发表演说，全文如下：亲爱的诸位先生：
    我今天能够参加加强中苏人民永久友谊的中苏友好协会成立大会，感觉无上的光荣。我向参加大会的各位先生们和英勇的中国人民致热烈的祝贺。
    诸位先生，今天全世界一切爱好自由的人民认为与苏联结成永久的友好关系，是自由和解放的保证。同时他们的心中是充满着对于世界和平堡垒——英勇的苏联人民及其伟大的领袖斯大林大元帅的感谢。我们对苏联人民的亲爱、尊敬和信任是坚忍不拔、永久不灭的，是任何力量都不可挫折的。这是由于苏联是真正的弱小民族的解放者及世界和平的堡垒，由于苏联如同太阳般的照耀着人类社会的光明的未来；由于苏联是不顾一切困难和牺牲为人类的幸福自由的新时代而斗争的苏维埃人们的国家，由于苏联是人类的太阳斯大林大元帅所领导的国家。
    亲爱的诸位先生，由于伟大的苏联军队的英勇奋斗和高贵的鲜血，朝鲜人民从狠毒的日本帝国主义的长久的统治下获得解放了。并且由于毫无私心的苏联的援助，我们朝鲜人民迅速地恢复和发展了朝鲜的民族文化。在这种有利条件上，我们胜利地完成了两个一年的人民经济计划，并在这个基础上建立了我们的共和国，进而进行使共和国经济、文化更加繁荣和发展的新的两年人民经济计划。这样从解放和援助中所实现的巩固的朝鲜和苏联两国的友谊就随着日月越发巩固起来了，人民的胜利也同样的日益增强。
    朝鲜人民在解放后从四年的实际生活和经验中，坚信唯有与苏联的紧密的互相合作和加强与发展巩固的朝鲜和苏联两国的友谊，才能够争取领土主权完整和民族自由。这种信心是永远要巩固下去的。
    诸位先生，英勇的中国人民，在中国共产党和英明的人民领袖毛泽东主席的领导下，已争取到具有历史意义的光荣的胜利。在今天成立的中苏友好协会，将起把有五千年的悠久历史传统的中国的文化与伟大的苏联社会主义文化同运河一般地交流的作用。它将促进人民中国的文化上的发展，从而促进中国人民的更伟大的胜利。它将在消灭人类社会中的一切奸恶敌人的斗争当中，能贡献有价值的作用。
    现在正是美英帝国主义者为首的国际反动派及其走狗们疯狂地挑拨新战争的时候，加强中苏两国人民的友谊一定会给予为和平民主而斗争的全世界人民莫大的鼓舞。因为今天全世界人类光明的未来，是只能在与伟大的社会主义国家苏联的友谊当中获得。爱好和平的人民和弱小民族的幸福自由和独立，只能在加强与伟大的社会主义国家苏联的友谊以及保卫和平民主的人民互相间的友谊及钢铁般的团结当中获得。
    我们朝鲜人民只有在与伟大的斯大林大元帅领导的英勇的苏联人民和毛泽东主席领导的胜利的中国人民加强巩固的友谊、亲密的合作之下，才能够对于争取祖国统一、独立、民族自由、反对美帝国主义及其走狗李承晚卖国党徒的斗争，预见它的胜利的光芒。所以我们对于今天诞生的具有历史意义的中苏友好协会致衷心的祝贺，并且我确信它的事业将一定能够获得巨大成就。
    中苏友好协会成立大会万岁！
    毛泽东主席领导下的英勇的中国人民万岁！
    朝中苏人民的永久不灭的友谊万岁！
    全世界劳苦大众的伟大领袖、导师和太阳斯大林万岁！
