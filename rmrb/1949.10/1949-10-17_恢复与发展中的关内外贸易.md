　　Restoration and Development of Trade Between Inside and Outside the Customs
　　By our correspondent in Shenyang, Yao Fu
    Under the correct guidance of the New Democratic commercial policy, and with the victorious development of the Chinese revolution, the exchange of goods between the Northeast and other parts of China is rapidly recovering. According to statistics from the Commercial Department of the Northeast People's Government, since the liberation of Tianjin and Beijing until the end of August, more than 300,000 tons of grain were transported to North China, of which the state-owned Dongxing Company transported more than 160,000 tons, and provincial-run stores and private merchants transported 140,000 tons, exchanging them for large quantities of yarn, industrial raw materials, and daily necessities. In addition, in April, the Shenyang Municipal Bureau of Commerce signed an exchange contract with the North China Trade Corporation, stipulating that the Northeast would exchange 60,701.52 cubic meters of timber (8,400 railway sleepers, 973,000 pit props, and 41,400 support timbers) for 10,000 tons of cement, 1.5 million jin of tobacco, 30,000 bolts of foreign cloth, and 600 bales of foreign yarn, which will be fully completed by the end of November. In September, the Foreign Trade Department of the Northeast Commercial Department exchanged 210 tons of rice and 1,500 bolts of Wufu cloth with the state-owned New China Economic Construction Company. Exchanges with the East China Liberated Area also began in August. Due to the opening of the Beijing-Shanghai railway and the increasing development of maritime transport, the Northeast has supported Shanghai with 30,000 tons of grain and 3,000 cubic meters of timber, exchanging them for large quantities of cloth. In addition to the above major items, trade between inside and outside the customs is also carried out through provincial-run stores, cooperatives, and private stores. According to statistics from Shanhaiguan, Yingkou, and Andong alone, the total value of material exchanges between inside and outside the customs for the three months of June, July, and August was 167,407,180 Northeast currency (hereinafter the same), of which the total value of exports accounted for 136,607,709 yuan, and imports accounted for 30,799,471 yuan.
    Trade between the Northeast and other parts of China is mainly with the North China region, of which exports to North China account for 94.72 percent of the total exports from the Northeast, and imports from North China account for 68.67 percent of the total imports. Exported goods are mainly food grains, accounting for 63.14 percent, followed by bean cake; imported goods are mainly yarn, accounting for 58.28 percent, followed by sacks and reed mats, accounting for 12.4 percent. As trade between the Northeast and other parts of China has been carried out, large quantities of surplus agricultural products and by-products have been organized for export, increasing the income of farmers and lowering the price of yarn, which is in short supply in the Northeast, relatively reducing the scissors difference between industrial and agricultural products. For example, the price of each bolt of Wufu cloth dropped from 2.5 million yuan in April to 2 million yuan in June, and the exchange rate of each ton of sorghum rice for cloth increased from 1.5 bolts to 3 bolts and even 4 bolts, increasing farmers' enthusiasm for production.
    The rapid restoration of material exchanges between inside and outside the customs and the fact that the Northeast has become a very important part of the national trade is due to the victory of the People's Liberation War and the correct implementation of commercial policies by the People's Government, as well as the joint efforts of the people. In order to encourage legitimate trade, the Northeast People's Government first promulgated measures for the circulation of materials, stipulating that: (1) trade between the Northeast and other liberated areas would mutually recognize tax receipts and not levy additional taxes; (2) the import and export of tobacco, alcohol, and luxury goods monopolized by the Northeast would be strictly prohibited. At the same time, in order to facilitate exchange, the People's Bank of China and the Northeast Bank established a joint office in Shanhaiguan, stipulating appropriate exchange rates under the principle of maintaining stable prices and benefiting economic construction, specializing in the exchange of bills for incoming and outgoing personnel. Recently, the People's Bank of China has implemented key remittance with the Northeast, and the exchange of materials between the north and south will be smoother. In terms of transportation, firstly, thanks to the efforts of railway workers, the fragmented Northeast railway network, which was severely damaged by the enemy, was rapidly restored, and transportation capacity was gradually increased. The original plan was to load 3,000 vehicles per day in 1949, with a turnover rate of four and a half days, but by June, the daily loading had reached 3,600 vehicles, and the turnover rate in July had been reduced to 3.44 days, which is the key to accelerating the exchange of materials between inside and outside the customs. In order to increase maritime transport, the Northeast People's Government opened Yingkou on April 19 and allocated 30 billion yuan to repair all port facilities destroyed by the Kuomintang army, which have now been largely completed, and this will be one of the important ports for the Northeast to connect with various places.

　　恢复与发展中的关内外贸易
    本报驻沈阳记者  药夫
    在新民主主义商业政策正确指导之下，随着中国革命形势的胜利发展，东北与关内各地的物资交流正在迅速恢复中。据东北人民政府商业部统计，自平津解放后到八月底运往华北的粮食三十万吨以上，其中国营商店东兴公司运送十六万余吨，省营商店与私商运送十四万吨，换回大批纱布、工业原料及日用必需品等。此外，四月沈阳市商业局与华北贸易总公司订立了交换合同，规定东北以木材六○、七○一·五二立方米（枕木八四○○根，坑木九七三○○○根，支架木四一四○○根），换回洋灰一万吨，烟叶一五○万市斤，洋布三万匹，洋纱六百件，十一月底即可全部完成。九月东北商业部对外贸易处与国营新中国经济建设公司交换大米二一○吨，五福布一千五百匹。八月与华东解放区亦开始了交换。由于京沪通车，海上运输日益展开，东北已以粮食三万吨，木材三千立方米支援上海，换回大批布匹。除以上大宗外，并通过省营商店、合作社及私营商店进行关内外贸易，仅据山海关、营口、安东三处统计，六、七、八三个月关内外物资交流总值为东北币（下同）一六七、四○七、一八○万元，其中输出总值占一三六、六○七、七○九万元，输入三○、七九九、四七一万元。
    东北与关内贸易以华北地区为主，其中对华北输出占东北输出总额百分之九十四点七二，由华北输入者占输入总额百分之六八·六七。输出物品以食粮为主，占百分之六三·一四，豆饼次之；输入主要是纱布占百分之五八·二八，其次为麻袋、苇席占百分之十二·四。由于东北与关内各地进行贸易，大批组织剩余农产品及副产品出口，增加了农民的收入，并使东北奇缺的纱布价格下降，相对的降低了工农业品的剪刀差额，如五福布每匹由四月份二五○万元至六月份降至二○○万元，一般由每吨高粮米换布一·五匹提到三匹以至四匹，提高了农民生产热忱。
    关内外物资交流得以迅速恢复，并使东北成为全国贸易的极重要的组成部分，这是由于人民解放战争的胜利及人民政府正确执行商业政策，并领导人民共同努力的结果。为奖励正当贸易，东北人民政府首先发布了物资流通办法，规定：（一）东北与其他解放区之间往来贸易，互相承认税票，不另征税；（二）东北专卖之烟酒及奢侈品一律禁止输入或输出。同时，为使交换方便，中国人民银行与东北银行在山海关成立联合办事处，在保持物价平稳有利经济建设原则下，规定适当牌价，专办来往人员票面兑换。最近，中国人民银行已与东北实行重点通汇，南北物资交流将更加顺畅。在交通运输方面，首先是由于铁路员工的努力，使惨遭敌人破坏的支离破碎的东北铁路网得以迅速恢复，并使运输力逐渐提高。原计划一九四九年每日装车率三千辆，周转率为四天半，但至六月份已达日装三千六百辆，七月份周转率减至三·四四天，这就是加速关内外物资交流的关键。为增加海上运输，东北人民政府于四月十九日开放营口，并拨款三百亿修建为国民党军所破坏的一切港口设施，现已大部竣工，这将为东北与各地联系的重要港口之一。
