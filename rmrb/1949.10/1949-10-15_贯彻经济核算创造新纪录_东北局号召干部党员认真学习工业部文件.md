　　Thoroughly Implement Economic Accounting to Create New Records
　　Northeast Bureau Calls on Cadres and Party Members to Conscientiously Study Ministry of Industry Documents
    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 14th. The Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China recently issued a decision, calling on leadership organs at all levels in the Northeast, all enterprise departments, and all cadres engaged in economic work and trade union work to conscientiously study the "Instructions on Continuing to Implement the Economic Accounting System" and the "Decision on Launching a Mass Movement to Create New Production Records" issued by the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government. The Northeast Bureau's decision pointed out: Thoroughly implementing the economic accounting system and launching a mass movement to create new production records are the basic keys to further promoting economic construction; the issuance of the two documents by the Industrial Department will be the starting point for a high tide of economic construction in the Northeast. All urban Party committees, especially Party organizations and Party members in industrial and mining enterprises, must conscientiously study these two documents and use their exemplary role to mobilize and organize the consciousness and enthusiasm of all workers, technicians, and staff to strive for the implementation and realization of the requirements of these two documents. The decision also stated: To implement these two documents, all management personnel and administrative comrades must oppose the erroneous style of work that does not listen to the opinions of workers and technicians, does not attach importance to Party and trade union work, refuses to mobilize the masses to examine and expose waste in production, stubbornly adheres to the standards of the puppet Manchukuo, outdated technical viewpoints, and emphasizes difficulties such as "abnormal production," "imperfect organization," "unstable prices," "untimely supply of raw materials," and "lack of experience," while failing to face up to the problems and shortcomings in their own work. At the same time, all urban Party committees and Party organizations and Communist Party members in industrial and mining enterprises, especially leading Party cadres, must overcome the erroneous method of opposing Party work and trade union work to production work and economic work, or conducting Party building and trade union work in isolation from production and economic work. At present, we should seize the opportunity to mobilize and organize all employees to launch a mass movement to create new production records and a mass anti-waste struggle to implement the economic accounting system and thereby promote democratic management. Party work and trade union work in state-owned enterprises under the leadership of urban Party committees, as well as Party and trade union work within various industrial and mining enterprises, must revolve around and be subordinate to this central task, actively and responsibly cooperate with administrative work, so as to mobilize and organize all employees from all aspects to ensure the realization of this task. At the same time, Party building, trade union consolidation, membership development, and trade union improvement should be carried out in conjunction. The decision further pointed out: If the economic accounting system cannot be implemented in a factory or mine, the production plan cannot be completed, and the Party and administrative policies cannot be implemented, then the Party and trade union there will bear serious political responsibility. The decision emphasized: All cadres engaged in economic work, all Party member cadres and non-Party cadres engaged in Party and trade union work in economic departments, and all leading cadres of urban Party committees must strive to learn the knowledge and technical knowledge of enterprise management so that they can become proficient in their business and become experts in their work. This is an urgent task put forward to us by actual life. Whoever does not study seriously will accomplish nothing in economic construction, will not be able to complete work tasks, and will fall behind. We oppose abstracting politics and oppose detaching from production and from various practical works surrounding production to engage in empty talk about politics. We advocate learning whatever we do, learning seriously, and studying assiduously, using the viewpoint of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to learn business, improve work, and complete and exceed production plans. This is the main learning direction for our economic work cadres.

　　贯彻经济核算创造新纪录
    东北局号召干部党员认真学习工业部文件
    【新华社沈阳十四日电】中共中央东北局最近发布决定，号召东北各级领导机关、各企业部门及一切作经济工作和工会工作的干部，认真学习东北人民政府工业部“关于继续贯彻经济核算制的指示”和“关于开展群众性创造生产新纪录的决定”这两个文件。东北局的决定指出：贯彻经济核算制和开展群众性创造生产新纪录运动，是目前推动经济建设工作前进一步的基本关键；工业部两个文件的发布将是东北经济建设高潮的起点。一切城市的党委特别是工矿企业中党的组织与党员们要认真学习这两个文件，以自己的模范作用动员与组织全体工人、技术人员、职员的觉悟性与积极性，为贯彻与实现这两个文件的要求而奋斗。决定又说：要贯彻这两个文件，一切管理人员和行政负责同志要反对那种不倾听工人、技术人员的意见，不重视党与工会工作，拒绝发动群众检查与揭发生产中的浪费，固执于伪满标准，陈旧的技术观点，以及强调“生产不正常”、“机构不健全”、“物价不稳定”、“原材料供给不及时”、“自己没有经验”等等的困难，而不正视自己工作中的毛病与缺点的错误作风。同时一切城市党委与工矿企业中党的组织与共产党员，尤其是党的领导干部，必须克服那种把党的工作、工会工作与生产工作、经济工作对立，或脱离生产与经济工作而孤立地进行建党与搞工会工作的错误办法。在当前应抓紧动员与组织全体职工开展群众性的创造生产新纪录运动与群众性的反浪费斗争，以贯彻经济核算制，并从而推动管理民主化。各城市党委领导下的国营企业中党的工作与工会工作以及各工矿企业内部的党与工会工作，都要围绕着与服从着这一中心任务，积极地负责地配合行政工作，以便从各方面动员与组织全体职工保证这一任务的实现。同时，并应结合进行建党与整理工会，发展会员，健全工会等工作。决定更指出：那个厂矿企业内经济核算制不能贯彻，生产计划不能完成，党与行政的方针不能贯彻，那里的党与工会，就要在政治上负严重的责任。决定强调指出：一切做经济工作的干部，一切在经济部门中进行党与工会工作的党员干部与非党干部，一切城市党委的领导干部，都要努力学习管理企业的知识与技术知识，使自己精通业务，成为工作内行，这就是实际生活向我们提出的迫切任务。谁要是不认真学习，谁就将在经济建设中一事无成，谁就不能完成工作任务，谁就会落伍。我们反对把政治抽象化，反对脱离生产，脱离围绕生产的各种实际工作而空谈政治。我们提倡做什么学什么，要认真地学，苦心钻研地学，以马列主义的观点与毛泽东思想来学习业务，改进工作，完成与超过生产计划，这就是我们经济工作干部主要的学习方向。
