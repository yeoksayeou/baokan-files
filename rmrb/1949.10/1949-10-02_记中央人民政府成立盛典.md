　　A Record of the Founding Ceremony of the Central People's Government

    The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China is officially established! This earth-shattering roar, when solemnly and loudly proclaimed by Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of China's 475 million people and Chairman of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, on Tiananmen Square in Beijing, triggered enduring cheers from the 300,000 people participating in the grand ceremony. The red five-star national flag slowly ascended the 22-meter-high flagpole, 54 cannons fired in unison, and the military band played the March of the Volunteers, which had inspired countless patriotic people to charge forward against Japanese imperialism more than a decade ago. The time was 3:00 PM on October 1st.

    The Chinese nation and the Chinese people, who have experienced countless profound disasters, will forever remember this precious moment: it announced the complete demise of old China and the birth of a new China belonging to the people. China and the Chinese people will no longer be synonymous with humiliating colonies and colonial slaves but will forever be respected by peace-loving and democratic people worldwide. From now on, the Chinese people will have a motherland standing tall in the world's peace and democracy camp, and a government that truly protects and represents them. The people of Beijing, who have suffered direct rule by feudal emperors for generations and the bloody massacres of Japanese fascists and the Chiang Kai-shek clique, will even more clearly and forever remember this precious moment.

    The red flags fluttering in the high sky like a dense forest, countless red five-pointed star lights, round lights, various weapons, and sickles and axes, all under the huge slogans of "Long Live the People's Republic of China," "Long Live the Central People's Government," and "Long Live Chairman Mao," symbolized the people's consistent and strong desire: to consolidate their motherland and the People's Government. Therefore, when Commander-in-Chief Zhu De reviewed the people's army, navy, and air force, and these troops held a parade in the center of the venue, equally fervent cheers erupted from the crowd. For the entire two and a half hours of the review, many people didn't even sit down once. Movie cameras, cameras, binoculars, and hundreds of thousands of eyes were constantly focused on the troops being reviewed, fearing that they might not see clearly or miss any visible weapon or soldier.

    The two and a half hour review of the people's armed forces gave the people an even more solid confidence in victory. Our young naval and air force units made their first public appearance in formation before the people's leaders and the broad masses of the people. The naval infantry's orderly steps and vibrant spirit convinced people that they, having transformed from nothing to something, would certainly grow from small to large. As our great motherland prospers and flourishes, we will build a strong navy. As the air force flew over the venue in ranks and files, hats and handkerchiefs flew up in the crowd, and newspapers and other items held in hands were waved. People clapped their hands to the resounding rhythm of the People's Liberation Army March played by the military band, keeping time, and making various sounds; hundreds of thousands of pulses throbbed at the same speed.

    Infantry units, artillery units, tank units, and cavalry units marched steadily in even lines and at equal speeds, regiment by regiment, division by division, forming the longest segment of the review, lasting until the sun set. However, people were not tired of it, nor did they find it too long; people asked each other, "What kind of artillery is this?" "What kind of people are these!" Everyone treated others as omniscient, wanting to gain more knowledge about their troops. The officers on the command platform, who had been through many battles, constantly explained to the non-military personnel beside them: "The first two side-by-side Jeeps are the commander and political commissar, the next two are the chief of staff and political director, the one behind is the flag bearer, this team of field artillery is the Japanese-style Type 90 field gun, which can fire 30 *li*, this is the American 155mm howitzer, this is a medium tank, this is an armored vehicle battalion,..." All the motorcycles, tanks, artillery vehicles... were painted, with red stars and the characters "八一" (August 1st), and the wheels were circled in white, the colors magnificent and consistent. These were specially decorated by the people's soldiers.

    Looking west on Chang'an Avenue, one did not know how many *li* the troops had marched; looking east on Chang'an Avenue, one did not know how many *li* of troops were still preparing to enter the venue; the more people watched, the more inspired they became, feeling that their motherland's armed forces were already so powerful. When many companies of the cavalry unit finally passed in front of the rostrum with extremely uniform five-horse abreast, they aroused repeated enthusiastic applause. Not only did they run in unison, but the color of the horses was also uniform by company, all white or all red.

    When the last team of cavalry passed by, the sun lamps and colored lights on the purple walls of Tiananmen Square began to glow in the twilight, and the lanterns and torches in the crowd were lit, the whole venue was a sea of fire and red waves; firecrackers shot clusters of red, green, and snow-white fireballs into the high sky, dragging countless beautiful fire threads, descending and crackling in a continuous sound. The crowds lining the streets on both sides of Chang'an Avenue began to watch the long procession of lantern parades, alternately shouting "Long Live the People's Republic of China," "Long Live the Central People's Government," and "Long Live Chairman Mao."

　　记中央人民政府成立盛典
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府正式宣告成立了！这一声震撼世界的巨响，由中国四亿七千五百万人民的伟大领袖、中华人民共和国中央人民政府毛泽东主席在北京天安门上庄严响亮地喊出的时候，参加盛典的三十万群众中爆发了经久不息的欢呼，红底五星的国旗徐徐升上二十二公尺的高竿，五十四门大炮齐鸣，军乐队奏起十多年前曾经激发了无数万爱国人民向日本帝国主义冲锋前进的义勇军进行曲。时间是十月一日下午三时。
    经历过无数次深重灾难的中华民族与中国人民将永远记得这个可珍贵的时刻：它宣布了旧中国完全死亡，宣布了人民的新中国的诞生。中国，中国人，将不再是屈辱的殖民地与殖民地奴隶的代名词，而要永远地受到全世界爱好和平民主的人民的尊敬了。中国人民从此有了屹立于世界和平民主阵营的祖国，有了真能保护自己，代表自己的政府。受过多少代封建帝王直接统治与日本法西斯、蒋家小朝廷血腥屠杀的北京人民，将更加清晰地永远记得这个可珍贵的时刻。
    密林般飘扬在高空的红旗，无数红色的五星灯、圆灯、各种兵器与镰刀斧头，都在“中华人民共和国万岁”、“中央人民政府万岁”、“毛主席万岁”的巨幅标语下标志出人们一致的强烈愿望：要巩固自己的祖国与人民政府。所以，在朱总司令检阅人民的海陆空军部队与这些部队在会场中心举行分列时，群众中涌起了同样狂热的欢呼。整整两个半钟头的检阅，许多人连坐也没坐一下。电影机、照像机、望远镜和几十万双眼睛，一直集中凝结在受检阅的部队身上，生怕看不清或漏过任何一个可以看得到的武器与战士。
    人民的武装部队两个半小时的检阅，给予人民的是更加坚固的胜利信心。我国年青的海军部队与空军部队，第一次公开的列队出现在人民领袖和广大人民的面前了。海军陆战队整齐的步伐、焕发的精神，使人坚信它们既从无变成有，必将从小变成大。随着我们伟大祖国的整荣鼎盛，我们会建设起一支强大的海军。空军成列成队地飞过会场的上空，人丛中帽子飞舞起来，手巾挥舞起来，手里拿着的报纸和其他物件都飞舞起来。人们随着军乐队奏出的解放军进行曲的响亮节奏拍着手，合着拍子，发出这样那样的声音，几十万的脉搏同速地挑动。
    步兵部队、炮兵部队、战车部队与骑兵部队以等距离、等速度整连整团整师地稳步行进，是检阅中历时最长的一段，一直顶到太阳西下。但是，人们不厌其多，不厌其久；人们互相询问着：“这是什么炮呀？”“这是什么人呀！”每个人都把别人当成全知者，想更多地得到对自己部队的知识。指挥台上久经战阵的军官们向身旁的非部队人员不断地解答着：“头两辆并排的小吉普车是指挥员和政委，后两辆是参谋长和政治主任，后面一辆是旗兵，这队野炮是日式九零野炮，能打三十华里，这是美国的十五生的大榴弹炮，这是中型坦克，这是装甲车营，……”所有摩托车与战车、炮车……都是油漆了的，装了红星与八一字样，轮子一圈白，颜色壮美而一致。这是人民的战士们加意装饰了的。
    往西长安街看，不知部队已走出多少里；往东长安街看，不知还有多少里长的部队准备走进会场来，人们越看越振奋，觉得自己祖国的武装力量已是如此地强大。骑兵部队的许多连队最后以极整齐的五马并跑经过主席台前时，激起多次的热烈鼓掌。不仅跑的齐，而且马的颜色也是以各个连队为单位，要白全白，要红全红。
    最后一队骑兵跑过去的时候，天安门紫壁上的太阳灯、各色灯光在黄昏里开始发亮，人丛里的灯笼火把都点着了火，全场一片火光红浪；爆花筒向高空成群成群地放出红色、绿色、雪白色火球，拉着无数美艳的火丝，回头下降，哔哔拍拍响成一片。东西长安街上夹道的人群，开始围观提灯游行的漫长行列，交互地喊起“中华人民共和国万岁”，“中央人民政府万岁”，“毛主席万岁”的欢声。
