The government has proposed a new plan to rapidly develop afforestation this year, requiring each key afforestation county to add at least 50 mu of nurseries. In order to promote the successful completion of this plan, we must prepare the seeds used in the nurseries in advance. Otherwise, if the seed collection period is missed, high-quality seeds will be difficult to obtain, and the nursery business cannot be completed. Now is the season for seed collection, and the following points for attention are introduced for reference.

　　　　I. Selection of Mother Trees

The quality of tree seeds is closely related to the mother tree. Seeds from young mother trees are large, have a high germination rate, and the seedlings grow well. However, after planting in afforestation areas, there are adverse phenomena such as early fruiting and weakened growth. Therefore, it is best not to collect seeds from young trees if possible. Seeds from old mother trees are generally small, light in specific gravity, have a low germination rate, and the seedlings grow poorly and are prone to death, making them unsuitable for seed collection. Only vigorous mother trees do not have the above shortcomings and are our sole target for seed collection.

Sparse forests and isolated vigorous mother trees are well-developed, and one tree can collect a lot of high-quality seeds, which is the best target for selecting seed collection trees.

　　　　II. Collection Season

Seed collection must wait until the seeds (i.e., fruits) are ripe. Unripe seeds cannot germinate and are not worth collecting to avoid wasting labor. However, it should be noted that some trees disperse their seeds as soon as they are ripe, and the time is very short. If you are not careful, you will miss the opportunity. Therefore, you must always check the mother trees and seize the opportunity, and never start collecting only after they are fully ripe, lest you miss out.

The maturity period of tree seeds varies depending on the tree species. The seeds scheduled to be collected this year are listed below:

Seed Name　　　　　Maturity Period　　　　　Maturity Color　　　　　　Remarks

Black Locust　　　Early to Mid-August　　　Pod Ochre, Seed Skin Light Brown　　Susceptible to insect pests, collect immediately after maturity
Purple Bush Clover　Mid-September　　　　Fruit Skin Ochre
Callery Pear　　　Early August　　　　Fruit Skin Brown　　　　Susceptible to insect pests, must be collected before leaf fall
Peach　　　　　　Early August　　　　Seedling Tree
Apricot　　　　　　Mid-June　　　　Seedling Tree
Walnut　　　　　　Mid-September　　　　Fruit Skin Orange-Green
Oriental Arborvitae　Late September　　　　Cone Brown
Pine Species　　　Late October　　　　Cone Brown　　　　Susceptible to insect pests and easily dispersed, collect quickly
Chinese Scholar Tree　Early October　　　　Pod Ochre

　　　　III. Collection Methods

Collect on windless, sunny days. It is necessary to look at the shape of the trees' growth and adapt to local conditions, without sticking to a fixed method. Collect in whatever way you can. For example, for large trees or when there are two mother trees not far apart, climbing is the most convenient way to collect. The method is to prepare a hemp rope, three or four cloth bags (foreign flour sacks are best), tie them around the waist, climb the tree trunk to a suitable height, tie one end of the rope to a tree branch, and tie the other end to your waist. There should be an appropriate distance for free movement between the person and the tree. At this time, with body stability, you can start working, collect and put the seeds into the cloth bag, throw it down when full, and then collect and load the second bag until it is exhausted.

In this way, even when climbing one tree, you can still collect seeds from adjacent trees, because the seeds grow at the tips of the tree crown, which are closest to the adjacent trees, so they are easily collected.

Using tools for collection is also very convenient, such as high branch shears, long-handled sickles, long-pole iron hooks, and forked sticks. Standing at a suitable height, cut off fruit branches or fruit spikes.

For small trees, ladders and stools can be used to climb and collect, or a long rope can be used to encircle one side of the tree crown, hold the two ends of the rope, and pull down the tree crown with force to make it bow-shaped, and another person can take the opportunity to collect, which is also very convenient.

　　　　IV. Seed Drying

After the seeds are collected, they should be dried immediately. Seeds wetted by rain should be spread out and dried immediately without delay.

Newly collected seeds contain a lot of moisture. If they are not spread out and dried immediately, but are originally sealed in bags, or piled up together, or poured into other containers, there is a risk of fermentation and spoilage due to the evaporation of the seeds.

There are two methods of drying: natural drying and artificial drying, which are described separately below.

(1) Natural Drying

Natural drying does not require equipment, the work is simple, and it saves expenses, which is often favored by us. Due to the different nature of the work, there are two types: sun drying and shade drying:

I. Sun Drying: This is to directly place the seeds in the sun. In a flat place with air circulation, spread a mat and scatter the seeds thinly on the mat, exposing them to direct sunlight. Turn them over three or four times a day so that both sides can be exposed to the sun. It takes about three to five days to dry on sunny days.

II. Shade Drying: This is mostly used for tree species that lose their germination power when exposed to direct sunlight, or when sun drying is impossible due to continuous rainy days. The method is very simple, that is, in a ventilated room (a shade shed is also acceptable), spread the seeds out flat, and turn them over with a rake from time to time. They will dry after four or five days.

(2) Artificial Drying

Artificial drying is a drying method that uses fuel as a heat source. It requires the use of equipment. The most convenient is a heated kang (brick bed). Spread the seeds on the heated kang and use the warmth of the heated kang to dry them. This is not affected by the weather and the work can be completed smoothly.

　　　　V. Seed Selection

After moderate drying, the seeds naturally split open, or the scales open, or they are beaten with tools to separate them from the fruit skin. The seeds easily mix with a lot of impurities and immature poor seeds (shriveled seeds), which must be selected before storage for later use.

Seed selection is usually carried out by wind selection and water selection.

(1) Wind Selection: Use tools such as windmills and winnowing baskets to remove dust, fruit skins, and poor seeds. Generally, large seeds only need one or two passes, while small seeds must be repeatedly selected four or five times. Winged seeds such as pine, ailanthus, maple, and sugar maple must first be put in a cloth bag and rubbed to separate the wings from the seeds, and then wind selected.

(2) Water Selection: The method is simple, the effect is great, and it is easy to do: pour water equal to more than three times the amount of seeds into a bucket, then put the seeds into the bucket, and stir slowly with a wooden stick so that the seeds are completely wetted by the water. At this time, the good seeds have a high specific gravity and sink to the bottom of the water, while the poor seeds (insect damage, shriveled seeds) have a low specific gravity and float on the surface of the water. Use a sieve to remove and discard them, then take out the seeds that have sunk to the bottom and spread them on a mat to dry, and these are the selected seeds.

Generally, large and medium-sized seeds and small seeds with a high specific gravity can be used. Seeds that have been wind selected must be water selected again to select pure and good seeds. Therefore, fine selection cannot be achieved without two layers of selection: first wind selection and then water selection.

(3) Selection of Special Seeds: For edible fruits such as peaches and apricots, eat the pulp, collect the pits, and dry them after water selection. For walnuts and mountain peaches whose pulp is inedible, they can be piled up to ferment and rot. Bundle five or six small wooden sticks the thickness of a finger into a bunch, crush the pulp, wash and select with water, and then dry them. Pome fruits such as Callery pears can be selected according to the walnut method, but the amount of water used for washing must be more than five times to obtain good results. These seeds do not need to go through the drying process. After collection, they can be directly piled up to rot and select.

　　　　VI. Seed Storage

The selected high-quality seeds must be placed in a dry and ventilated place to prevent them from becoming damp and moldy again. They must also be checked frequently, and if they are found to be damp, they must be dried immediately. Rodents and insect pests are also major problems in storage, so pay more attention to prevention and control.

If the number of seeds is not large, they can be put in cloth bags and hung on the beams of the room, which can prevent moisture and avoid rodent damage, which is the best strategy for storage.

Recently, a cellar storage method has become popular, which has the dual function of storage and promoting germination. It can be tried for direct sowing (those not used for sowing but for sale should not implement it). It is most convenient to implement for large seeds such as walnuts, apricots, and chestnuts. In a dry place (a place with a low groundwater level and not prone to waterlogging), dig a hole 2 feet deep and 1.5 to 2 feet wide (the length can be appropriately determined according to the amount of seeds). Spread a 1-inch thick layer of fine sand on the bottom of the hole, then arrange a layer of seeds, and spread a layer of fine sand so that the seeds are filled with fine sand between the seeds (the seeds must not touch each other). Arrange layer by layer in this way until half of the hole is reached (full 1 foot), then spread another layer of fine sand on the upper part, and finally fill the hole with soil, and pile a 1-foot high mound of soil on the mouth of the hole to prevent rainwater from entering. Apricots, walnuts, and mountain peaches are buried from the time the seeds are collected until before sowing. In this way, when taken out for sowing, they germinate very early and very neatly, which can avoid the adverse phenomenon of germinating one or two months after sowing, and the difference between early and late germination is too great.

　　怎样采集树籽
    沙荒造林局
    今年政府为迅速发展造林事业，已提出了普设公私营苗圃的新计划，要求每一个造林重点县，最少须增设苗圃五十亩。我们为促进这个计划的胜利完成，对于苗圃所用的种籽，必须事前有所准备。否则采种时期错过，优良种籽就不易求得，苗圃事业就不能完成。现在正是采种的季节，特将应注意的事项介绍于下，以供参考。
    　　　　一、母树的选择
    树籽的好坏和它的母树很有关系，幼龄母树的种籽粒大，发芽率大，苗木生长良好，但是到了造林地定植后，有结实过早，生长衰弱的不良现象，所以在可能范围内，以不采幼龄树的种籽为最好。老龄母树的种籽，一般都是粒小，比重轻，发芽率小，苗木生长不良，很容易枯死，不适于采种之用。唯壮龄母树没有上述的缺点，是我们采种的唯一对象。
    疏林和孤立的壮龄母树，发育健全，一株就能采取很多的优良种籽，实为采种选树的最好目标。
    　　　　二、采集的季节
    采集种实（即果实）必待其成熟，不熟的种籽不能发芽，无采取的必要，以免浪费劳力。但须注意，有的树木，种实在刚一成熟，种籽即行飞散，为时很短，一不留心，就失掉机宜。所以必须时时查看母树，掌握住时机，万不可等十分成熟后才着手，以致落空。
    树木种籽的成熟期。因树种之不同亦不一致，兹将今年预定搜集的种籽列下：种籽名　       成熟期　        　成熟色泽        　　备　　考洋槐        八月上、中旬      荚赭色、种籽皮浅褐色  易罹虫害成熟即采紫穗槐      九月中旬          果皮赭色杜梨        八月中旬          果皮褐皮              易罹虫害必在落叶前采完桃          八月中旬          实生树杏          六月中旬　　　　　实生树胡（核）桃  九月中旬          果皮橙绿色侧柏        九月下旬          球果褐色松类　　　  十月下旬          球果褐色              易罹虫害且易飞散宜速采中国槐      十月上旬          荚赭色
    　　　　三、采集方法
    在没有风的晴天采取，须看树木生长的形状，因地制宜，不可拘泥一定的方式，能怎样采取就怎样去作，例如大树或遇有二株相距不远的母树，则以攀登采取最便。其法可预备麻绳一条，布袋（洋面袋最好）三、四条，系在腰间，攀登树干到达适当的高度时，用绳的一端绑在树的枝干上，一端拴住自己的腰部，人树之间要有自由活动的适当距离，这时身体有了安定性，便可开始工作，随采随装入布袋，满了投下，再采装第二袋，直至采尽为止。
    如此虽攀登一树，尚可采取邻接树上的种籽，因为树籽生长在树冠的梢部，距离邻接树最近，所以很易采得。
    使用器械采取，也很便利，例如高枝剪、长把镰刀、长杆铁钩、义丫木等，站在适当的高度，切取果枝或果穗。
    在小树用梯、凳、登高，就可采取，或用长绳一条，由树冠的一边围绕，握住绳的两端，用力拉下树冠，使成弯弓状，由另一人趁机采取，亦很便利。
    　　　　四、种实的干燥
    种实采集后，应立即施行干燥，受雨水濡湿的种实更得立时散开干燥，不可迟延。
    新采下的种实，都含有多量的水分，倘不即行散开干燥，原封装在袋里，或堆积一起，或倒在其他容器里，都有因种实蒸散作用而发酵腐败的危险。
    干燥的方法，有自然干燥和人工干燥二种，兹分述之。
    （１）自然干燥
    自然干燥不用设备，工作简便，节省经费，常为吾人所乐用，因工作性质不同，有晒干和荫干两种：
    一、晒干：就是把种实直接放在日光下，在空气流通的平坦地方，铺上席子，把种实薄薄的散布在席子上，受日光直接曝晒，每天翻拌三、四回，使上下都能晒着。晴天约晒三至五天就好。
    二、荫干：多用于因受日光直射就失掉发芽力的树种，或因天雨连绵晒干不可能时，须施行荫干。方法甚简，即在通风的室内（荫棚亦可），把种实散开铺平，时时用耙子上下翻转，经过四、五天就干燥了。
    （２）人工干燥
    人工干燥是以燃料为热源的干燥法，须利用设备，最便的就是火炕，把种实铺在火炕上，用火炕的温热来干燥，可不受天气的影响，顺利完成工作。
    　　　　五、种籽的选别
    适度干燥后的种实，由种实的自然裂开，或鳞片的开口，或用器械捶打，使之脱离果实皮，其种籽内皆易混入很多的夹杂物，和未成熟的不良种籽（瘪子），必须选别才能储藏备用。
    选别种籽，普通依风选和水选来实行。
    （一）风选：使用风车子，簸箕等器具，把尘芥、果实皮，和不良的种籽除去，一般大粒种籽只一、二回，小粒种籽非四、五回返复选别不可。有翅的种籽如松类、臭椿、枫、糖械类，须先装在布袋里揉搓，使翅和种脱离，再行风选。
    （二）水选：方法简单效果很大，且易办到：用一个桶倒入等于种籽量三倍以上的清水，然后放种籽入桶里，用木棒徐徐搅拌，使种籽完全沾着水，这时优良的种籽比重大，下沉水底，不良的种籽（虫伤，瘪粒）比重小，漂浮水面，用笊篱取出抛弃，再将下沉的种籽取出，散在席子上干燥，便是选好的种籽。
    一般大中粒的种籽和比重大的小粒种籽皆可使用，又经风选后的种籽，须再水选，才能选出纯良的种籽，所以精选非先行风选而后再水选的二层选别，不能达到目的。
    （三）特殊种籽的选别：如桃杏类果肉可食者，食其果肉，集其果核，经水选干燥即可。如胡（核）桃及山桃之果肉不可食者，可堆积使之发酵腐烂，用指粗的小木棍五、六根捆成一束，撮碎果肉，经水淘洗选别，干燥即可。杜梨类的仁果可依照胡桃法以选别，惟洗涤时，所用水量必在五倍以上，才能获得良好成绩。这类种实都不必经过干燥的手续，采取后直接堆积使之腐烂选别就可。
    　　　　六、种籽的保管
    精选的优良种籽，务必放在干燥且通风的地方，以防再潮湿而霉烂。并须时时检查，倘发现潮湿，立即干燥。鼠害虫害亦为保管中之大患，多加注意防除为要。
    倘种籽为数不多，可装在布袋里，吊挂室内梁间，既防潮湿且避鼠患，殊为保管之上策。
    最近盛行一种窖藏法，具有储藏和促进发芽的二层作用，对于直接播种者可以试行（不用以播种而供贩卖者，不可施行），胡桃、杏、栗等大粒种籽实行最便。在干燥的地方（地下水位低且不易潴水的地方），掘深达二尺，宽由一尺半到二尺的穴（长可按种籽量适宜规定），穴底撒布一寸厚的细沙，然后摆一层种籽，铺一层细沙，使种籽与种籽之间也有细沙填充（种籽不可互相接触），如此一层一层的摆列达到穴的一半时（满一尺），上部再铺一层细沙，最后把穴用土填满，并在穴口，堆上一尺高的土堆，以防雨水的浸入，杏和胡桃、山桃，从种籽采集后一直埋到播种前，这样，取出播种，发芽很早，且很整齐，可免除播后一两个月才发芽，和发芽早晚相距太远的不良现象。
