　　"Our People's Armed Forces Must Be Preserved and Developed"
　　——Some Reflections on Studying the Documents of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
　　199th Division, 67th Army, Wang Xun
　　The People's Liberation Army is an important component of the state machinery. As a small cog in this machine, I would like to share some of my thoughts on studying the documents of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

　　In the past, I was a student and always thought that being a soldier was for the uneducated. In 1943, I left Beijing, which was under the brutal rule of the Japanese invaders, and headed for the liberated areas. The first test I encountered was the last frenzied "mopping-up" operation by the Japanese invaders, which made me realize the ferocious face of the national enemy. After the unconditional surrender of the Japanese invaders, illusions of peace arose: "Let's study natural sciences; with peace, it will be useful for construction." However, the civil war ignited by the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries followed, shattering my past naive and laughable individualistic fantasies. We put aside our books and pens and finally joined the army. Following the army in battles across North China, I learned a practical lesson in the midst of arduous fighting: in the historical period when classes have not been eliminated and the imperialist system still exists in the world, our army is still a fighting force. No one should have any misunderstanding or wavering on this point.

　　The Chinese people suffered from the multiple oppressions and exploitations of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. But under the correct leadership of our proletarian party, we finally overturned the world and reversed the situation. And this unparalleled great revolutionary victory was achieved through persistent and unremitting fighting with the enemy, holding guns in our hands.

　　During the revolution, countless outstanding Chinese sons and daughters, for the sake of the people's complete liberation, took up arms and bravely plunged into the liberation war. Numerous heroic fighters, amidst the exploding smoke, seized fortresses and occupied city walls. Countless immortal martyrs, one after another, fell in the gunfire, exchanging their blood for today's victory. Facts educate us on how important and glorious armed struggle is! As Chairman Mao said: "The Chinese revolution has three main experiences: a disciplined party armed with the theory of Marxism-Leninism and adopting the method of self-criticism, which maintains close ties with the masses; an army led by such a party; and a united front of all revolutionary classes and revolutionary factions led by such a party."

　　Precisely because of these three main experiences, we have today's unprecedented people's victory, and the establishment of the People's Republic of China. The bloody lessons have taught us such profound and valuable experiences.

　　Today, the People's Liberation War has achieved a decisive victory, and the country is about to be completely liberated. But can we lay down our arms? Just think calmly: we have just eliminated the enemy, and the barrels of our guns are still hot. The blood of our comrades-in-arms has not yet dried. Our difficult days are not yet over. The imperialist warmongers are greedily squatting beside us, and the reactionary remnants of Chiang Kai-shek are still plotting restoration. We must strengthen our armed forces even more.

　　"Our people's democratic dictatorship is a powerful weapon to safeguard the victory of the people's revolution and to oppose the restoration plots of enemies at home and abroad. We must firmly grasp this weapon." Our People's Liberation Army must not relax its fighting will in the slightest and must firmly hold the guns in its hands. The stronger our armed forces are, the more cowardly the enemy will be.

　　At the same time, we should also look far ahead and recognize that "the past work is only like the first step in a long march of ten thousand miles." The arduous tasks and beautiful ideals of the future still require us to contribute even greater efforts. We must protect the great construction of our motherland like we shoulder our guns to protect the people's autumn harvest; we must clear out the remnants of the counter-revolutionaries like scouts; and we must show the heroic spirit of liberating the motherland to defend lasting world peace.

　　“我们的人民武装力量必须保存和发展起来”
    ——学习中国人民政协文献的一点心得
    六七军一九九师  王恂
    人民解放军是国家机器中一个重要组成部分，我以这个机器中一支微小的螺丝钉的身份，来谈一下自己学习人民政协文献的一点心得。
    在过去，我是一个学生，总认为当兵是老粗的事。一九四三年，我离开了野蛮的日寇统治的北京，走向解放区。我所遭到的第一个考验，是日寇最后一次的疯狂“扫荡”，它使我认清了民族敌人的凶恶面目。日寇无条件投降，和平幻想又来了：“学学自然科学吧，和平了，建设上用的着。”但，蒋介石反动派的内战炮火却随之而来了，这炮声击破了我过去幼稚可笑的个人主义的幻想。我们撇开书本、笔杆，终于参军了。随军转战华北，在艰苦的战斗中，我上了实际的一课：在阶级没有消灭和世界上还存在着帝国主义制度的历史时期内，我们军队还是一个战斗的队伍。对于这一点，谁也不能有任何的误解和动摇。
    中国人民受尽了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义重重的压迫剥削，但我们有着无产阶级政党的正确领导，终于翻天覆地，扭转了乾坤。而这个无比伟大的革命的胜利，是必须握有枪杆，来与敌人坚持不懈的战斗而取得的。
    在革命中，多少优秀的中国儿女，为了人民彻底的翻身，拿起枪杆，勇敢地投入了解放战争。多少战斗的英雄，在爆炸的烟雾中，夺取了堡垒，占领了城头。多少不朽的烈士，在炮火中前仆后继，以他们的鲜血，换取了今天的胜利。事实教育我们，武装的斗争是多么重要！多么光荣！正如毛主席所说：“中国革命有三个主要经验，一个有纪律的有马、恩、列、斯的理论武装的采取自我批评方法的联系人民群众的党。一个由这样党领导的军队。一个由这样党领导的各革命阶层各革命派别的统一战线。”
    正由于这三个主要的经验，才有今天史无前例的人民胜利，才能成立了中华人民共和国。血的教训告诉了我们多么深刻宝贵的经验。
    在今天，人民解放战争取得了决定性的胜利，全国即将完全解放。但是，我们能放下枪杆吗？只要冷静地想一下：我们刚消灭了敌人，枪膛还热着。我们的战友的血，还没有干。我们艰苦的日子，还没有过去。帝国主义的战争贩子们正贪婪地蹲在我们旁边，蒋介石的反动残余还打算着复辟的阴谋。我们不能不更加强我们的武装力量。
    “我们的人民民主专政的国家制度是保障人民革命的胜利成果和反对内外敌人的复辟阴谋的有力的武器，我们必须牢牢地掌握这个武器。”我们人民解放军必须丝毫不松懈自己的战斗意志，握紧手中的枪杆。我们的武装力量越强大，敌人的胆子就越怯小。
    同时，我们还应该把眼光放远，认清：“过去的工作只不过象万里长征走完了第一步。”未来的艰巨的事业和美丽的理想，还须要我们贡献更大的力量。我们要象肩着枪保卫人民秋收一样，来保卫我们祖国的伟大建设；我们要象侦察员一样，来肃清反革命的残余势力；我们更要拿出解放祖国的英勇精神，来保卫世界持久的和平。
