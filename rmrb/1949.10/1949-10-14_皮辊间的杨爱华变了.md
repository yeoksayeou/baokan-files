　　Yang Aihua used to be the kind of person in the roller room who only took his wages and didn't do any work. He was a standing supervisor of the old trade union, with puppet leaders outside and a few sworn brothers in the factory. So he was always late to work in the morning. When others had already started working, he was still chatting and changing clothes. Sometimes, if he was in a good mood, he would go to the trade union to sit for a while or wander around the workshop. Pretending to work was real, but he didn't care about his own job. After liberation, he realized that his previous actions were wrong. He resolutely said, "From today onwards, this factory belongs to the people. I will work hard to produce and will not be lazy anymore." Indeed, he has changed. When going to work, he no longer wants to lag behind others. He also cares about the work in the workshop and urges his colleagues to work harder. (He is the person in charge of the roller room.) If the roller grinding machine is broken, he is the first to say it should be repaired. He also points out the reason, saying, "If the rollers are not ground, the water will not dry easily, the glue will not be absorbed easily, and the rollers will be of different sizes. The yarn spun on the machine will be thick and thin and will have fuzz." So he decided to repair it himself. He didn't panic, using his flexible brain and diligent hands. He worked hard for half a day and actually achieved his goal. However, the roving roller grinding machine had been broken since the enemy-puppet era, and the situation was even worse than the fine yarn roller grinding machine, so it had never been repaired. But he was determined, saying, "I will definitely fix it. If I don't fix it, don't believe what I say in the future." He slowly traced the problem based on the principle. When a screw broke, he made one himself, burning the gas himself. He repaired it for a whole day and finally fixed it. Now the rollers being used are much more compliant than before. In addition, he also does some of the more difficult work himself. Such as washing rollers and wiping spindles, work that he would never touch in the past. Now, when he sees others are busy, he works harder to get his own work done and quickly helps others. He said, "My previous laziness was not my nature, it was caused by the environment." He also said, "To do a good job in the roller room, the first thing is to unite, don't make the old mistakes of each caring for himself, no one caring for anyone else, and there is no spirit of mutual assistance. Now we are the masters, and everyone is responsible for the quality of the work. Suppose a colleague in that part takes leave, we shouldn't necessarily go to the foreman to ask for someone. If everyone works harder, wouldn't we be taking care of one person's livelihood? This way, we are energetic and have a spirit of mutual assistance." The current Yang Aihua has changed for the better, and the people in the roller room all unanimously praise him.

　　皮辊间的杨爱华变了
    中纺十四厂工人  爱影
    杨爱华以前是皮辊间只拿工钱不做事的人。他是老工会的常务监事，外面有伪头子，厂中也有几个把兄弟。所以早晨上工，总落在别人的后面。当人家已在开始工作时，他还在聊天换衣服，有时高兴便走到工会去坐坐，或是到车间里去逛逛。工作是假意“吃豆腐”是真的，对本身工作是不过问的。解放后，他觉悟以前的行动是不对的。他曾这样坚决的说：“从今天起，这厂是人民的了，我要努力生产，不再偷懒。”的确，他是变了，上工时，再不愿落在人家的后面。车间里的事也关心的干，同时他还劝同事加紧的干。（他是皮辊间的负责人）如轧皮辊机坏了，他首先说要修理，他更指出道理说：“如皮辊不经过轧，水不易干，胶不易吸进，皮辊大小不一，到车子上纺出来的纱有粗细，还有毛头。”所以他决心自己动手修理。他不慌不忙，用灵活的脑，勤快的手，忙碌了半天，居然达到目的。可是粗纱轧皮辊机在敌伪时代便坏了，情形比细纱轧皮辊机还厉害，因此便从来没有修理过。但是他抱定决心，他说：“我绝对把它修好，如不修好，你们以后不要相信我的话。”他慢慢的根据原理去追索。有一个螺丝坏了，自己去做，烧瓦斯自己去烧，整整的修了一天，终于修理好了。现在使用的皮辊，可比往日服贴得多了。此外，一些比较苦的工作，他自己也去干。如洗皮辊，揩心子，这些工作在往日是摸也不摸的。现在他看到别人的工作忙，自己就把工作加劲做好，赶快去帮人家做。他说：“我以前的偷懒，并不是我的本性，是环境造成的。”他又说：“皮辊间的工作要搞好，首先要团结，不要犯以前的老毛病，各顾各，谁也不关顾谁，没有互助的精神是不对的。现在我们是主人，工作的好坏，每个人都有责任。假设那一部分一个同事请假了，我们不要一定去向拿摩温吵了要人，大家努力点，不是就把一个人的生活做掉了吗？这样又起劲，而又有互助的精神。”现在的杨爱华是变好了，皮辊间里的人，都一致异口同声的赞扬。
