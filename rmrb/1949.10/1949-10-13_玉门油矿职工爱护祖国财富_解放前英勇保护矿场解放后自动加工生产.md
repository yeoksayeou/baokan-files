Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, October 10th: Yumen News: All employees of the famous Yumen Oilfield valiantly protected the factory and welcomed liberation as the People's Liberation Army rapidly advanced into Northwest China. Yumen Oilfield is one of China's largest oilfields, founded in 1938 and exploited by the Kuomintang bureaucratic capitalist China Petroleum Corporation's Gansu-Qinghai branch, with a total of more than 4,000 employees. As early as September 25, half a month before the liberation of Yumen, all oilfield employees began mobilizing to protect the factory, dismantling valuable machinery and burying it in the valleys. They also spontaneously organized an autonomous team to stand guard and patrol, preventing the Kuomintang bandits from sabotaging oilfield equipment. At 4:00 PM on September 25, the People's Liberation Army's armored forces swiftly arrived in the mining area, thwarting the Kuomintang bandits' sabotage plot. This valuable national asset was finally preserved intact. All oilfield employees are now celebrating their liberation with active work. Refinery workers are working hard to build houses; workers will complete the new oil wells in the mine that have not been completed in the shortest possible time and plan to drill new oil wells. Workers at the repair shop are working hard to repair tanks and vehicles for the People's Liberation Army, and have repaired 32 tanks and vehicles from September 25 to 30. Some workers are also automatically processing and producing. On October 1, more than 6,000 employees and their families automatically used the towels, socks, and soap they had saved to warmly慰劳 the People's Liberation Army armored forces that liberated the mining area. Nine employee representatives transported the慰劳品 in cars to various locations, fully expressing the oilfield workers' friendship to the People's Liberation Army. The People's Liberation Army has now appointed Kang Shi'en and Zhang Shouyu as military representatives of the oilfield, responsible for leading all employees in production.
