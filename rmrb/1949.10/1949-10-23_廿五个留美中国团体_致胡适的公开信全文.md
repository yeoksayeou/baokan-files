[Hong Kong News] The full text of the open letter to Mr. Hu Shih from twenty-five Chinese student groups in the U.S., published by the New York China Daily on August 25, is as follows:
Mr. Hu Shih:

Recently, the Chiang regime has repeatedly used American planes to indiscriminately bomb Shanghai citizens, destroy the Yangtze River dikes, and strafe personnel repairing the breaches. At the end of their rope, they are acting perversely, a fact which has been denounced by democratic figures both at home and abroad. Yet you, who constantly speak of "democracy and freedom," openly support these atrocities, running around appealing to the United States to expand its aid to Chiang, attempting to prolong the war. We, the various Chinese student groups in the U.S., are heartbroken and infuriated by your betrayal of your compatriots and your selling out of the motherland, and have unanimously resolved to issue you a serious warning.

Since you cut yourself off from the people of our country and fled to the United States, you have not reflected on your actions in seclusion, seeking atonement, but instead have stirred up trouble and spread rumors, adding to your sins. You have given numerous speeches to various American groups, slandering the various measures of the new China; you have presided over so-called "national affairs symposiums," defending the corruption, darkness, and brutality of the Chiang regime, insisting that the Chinese people have consistently supported Chiang; you have signed the "July 7th" memorial declaration, advocating "suppression of the rebellion to the end," and advocating a "scorched earth policy."

You have also colluded with Kong Xiangxi, Song Ziwen, Jiang Tingfu, Li Weiguo, Gu Weijun, Lai Lian, and others, plotting to organize the so-called "Free Democratic China League," openly supporting the "open door" and "equal opportunity" principles of the "Nine-Power Treaty," so that China will forever be enslaved and slaughtered by the great powers; and advocating that more Japanese troops be sent back into our territory to jointly "oppose communism," even advocating a third world war, not hesitating to trample and devastate our motherland's land and people, only to give you the opportunity to return to China to exploit the people and act as overlords! This is your so-called "democracy," your so-called "freedom."

Thirty years ago, you opposed "Confucius's shop" and advocated vernacular writing, for which you were respected and loved by many people in China at that time; you praised Anglo-American "democracy" and advocated "moderation," which was appreciated by Anglo-American gentry, and you became a "well-known figure at home and abroad." Later, you worked tirelessly for the dictator every day, "abandoning human rights to speak of royal power" (Lu Xun's words), and did your best to defend imperialism, viewing imperialist aggression as the import of civilization. Thus, the imperialists praised you as a "high-class Chinese," even a "young Confucius." Thus, the Chinese dignitaries favored you even more, and even He Jian, who advocated "venerating Confucius and reading the classics" and killed people like flies, hired you to give a speech in Changsha for the price of five thousand yuan. From then on, you believed that only the "middle-of-the-roaders" were "where the people's hearts belonged" and that "their future expansion would be promising."

During the May 30th Massacre in 1925, Peking University organized a faculty and staff support association. Because you were colluding with figures from the Political Science Department, secretly working to join the British Boxer Indemnity Committee, you not only refused to join the support association, but instead sided with the British, advocating that the matter be resolved using "legal methods." In 1946, an American soldier raped Peking University student Shen Chong, and the whole country was outraged. In order to cater to the pleasure of the American-Chiang authorities and extricate them from their predicament, you again proposed "legal methods," advising everyone to "be tolerant." When the Japanese bandits were plotting to take our country most urgently, you openly suggested to the Japanese warlords that they should use a gradual approach "in order to conquer the hearts of the Chinese people." For a time, public opinion was in an uproar, and Mr. Lu Xun wrote a special article severely criticizing your fallacies. After the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Chiang party acted arbitrarily, disregarding the appeals for peace from all parties and believing in military dictatorship. You actually participated in the making of the "constitution" under such circumstances, embellishing public opinion. The corruption and darkness of the Chiang regime are obvious to all. How can a piece of paper guarantee the freedom and democracy of the people! It is nothing more than giving the dictator a basis for dictatorship.

Thirty years ago, you scolded Kang Youwei, who was carrying out restoration, as a "shameless antique." Now you are doing your best to run around for the "restoration" of the Chiang regime, and you yourself are a shameless antique. After Kang Youwei failed, he still knew to close his doors to guests and no longer engage in activities. After your support for Chiang failed, you were not tolerated by the people of the country. After fleeing to the United States, you are still scheming and plotting, colluding with bureaucrats and gangsters, looking to the Americans for guidance, acting in collusion and doing evil together. How can the Chinese people's democracy and freedom be sought from American dignitaries and merchants and the like of Kong, Song, Gu, and Lai! Your words and deeds are shameful, and your intentions are punishable!

In the past six months, your relatives, friends, and students have all earnestly and gently advised you, and your old colleague, Mr. Chen Yuan, the president of Fu Jen Catholic University, has also given you clear and sincere advice. You did not listen at all. Now we cannot help but seriously warn you: the movement of the people of our motherland to fight for democracy and freedom will achieve a comprehensive victory in a short period of time. Your traitorous actions can only increase the suffering of some of our compatriots and cannot hinder the progress of our motherland. Do not think that under the protection of the United States, you can do whatever you want and be at large. When the situation changes and the light shines everywhere, even if you escape to the ends of the earth, you will be arrested and brought to justice. Chen Gongbo fled to Japan, but was still chased back to China and executed. This is your example!

If you still have a little conscience and humanity, you should immediately stop all traitorous actions. If you can repent, humbly learn, and start anew, atone for your sins, the people of our country may be able to grant you some leniency and reduce your punishment.

Be a servant of the people or a traitor, fortunately choose your own path!

　　廿五个留美中国团体
  　致胡适的公开信全文
    【香港讯】纽约华侨日报八月二十五日所发表的二十五个留美中国团体致胡适的公开信全文如下：胡适先生：
    最近蒋政权屡次使用美国飞机，滥炸上海市民，毁坏长江堤岸，扫射抢修决口人员，日暮途穷，倒行逆施，已为中外民主人士所同声申讨，而你口述“民主自由”，却公然拥护暴行，奔走呼吁美国扩大援蒋，企图战祸之延长。我留美中国各团体，对于你背叛同胞出卖祖国的行为，痛心疾首，忍无可忍，经一致决议，向你提出严重警告。
    自从你自绝于国人，逃亡美国之后，不知闭门思过，以图自赎，反而煽惑招摇，加重罪孽。你多次向美国各种团体演讲，丑诋新中国之种种措施；主持所谓“国是座谈会”，为蒋政权的腐败黑暗残暴辩护，力言中国人民始终拥蒋；签名于“七七”纪念宣言，主张“戡乱到底”，主张“焦土政策”。
    你又和孔祥熙、宋子文、蒋廷黻、李惟果、顾维钧、赖琏等人同流合污，策动组织所谓“自由民主中国联盟”，公然拥护“九国公约”之“门户开放”、“机会均等”的原则，使中国永受列强的奴役宰割；并主张增派日兵重入国土，共同“反共”，甚至鼓吹第三次世界大战，不惜祖国的土地人民蹂躏涂炭，只求你们有机会再回到中国去鱼肉人民作威作福！这就是你们的所谓“民主”所谓“自由”。
    三十年前，你反对“孔家店”，提倡白话文字，你为当时中国不少人士所尊重爱护；你歌颂英美式的“民主”，主张“中庸主义”，为英美的士绅所赏识，而变成“中外知名”的人物。后来，你更天天为独裁者卖气力，“抛却人权说王权”（鲁迅语），竭力为帝国主义辩护，视帝国主义之侵略为输入文明。于是，帝国主义者称赞你是“高等华人”，甚至是“青年孔夫子”。于是，中国的权贵对你更是大加青睐，连主张“尊孔读经”杀人如麻的何键，也以五千元的价钱请你去长沙演讲。从此，你竟认为只有“中坚派”是“人心所归”，“将来势力扩充，大有可为”了。
    一九二五年五卅惨案时，北京大学组织教职员后援会。你因为正在勾结政学系人物，暗中进行加入英庚款委员会，所以非但不肯加入后援会，反而袒护英方，主张用“法律方法”着手解决。一九四六年，美兵强奸北大女生沈崇，全国震愤。你为着迎合美蒋当局的欢心，替他们解围，竟又提出了“法律方法”，劝大家“容忍”。在日寇谋我最亟的时候，你公然向日本军阀献议：须用缓进的方法，“才能征服中国的人心”。一时舆论哗然，鲁迅先生并曾专文严斥你的谬论。抗战结束，蒋党一意孤行，不顾各方人士的呼吁和平，迷信武力独裁，你竟在这种局势之下，参加制“宪”，粉饰民意。蒋政权之腐败黑暗，世所共见，试问一纸空文如何能保障国人的自由民主！无非是给独裁者以独裁的根据。
    三十年前，你骂进行复辟的康有为是“无耻的古董”。现在你极力为蒋政权的“复辟”奔走，你自己就是无耻的古董。康有为失败之后尚知闭门谢客不再活动，你拥蒋失败，不见容于国人，逃亡美国之后，还是营营苟苟，勾结官僚党痞，仰望美方鼻息，沆瀣一气，狼狈为奸。试问中国人民的民主自由，如何能求之于美国的达官巨商和孔宋顾赖之流！你的言行可耻，你的用心可诛！
    半年来，你的亲友门生都曾苦口婆心婉言劝过你，你的老同事辅仁大学校长陈垣先生也曾明白忠告过你。你全不听。现在我们不能不再严重警告你：祖国人民争民主争自由的运动，短期间内就要取得全面胜利，你的卖国行为，只能增加一些同胞的苦难，绝不能阻挠祖国的前进。你不要以为在美方庇护下，可以为所欲为，逍遥法外，等到情势一变，光明普照的时候，就是你逃到天涯海角，也要缉拿归案。陈公博逃匿日本，还是追捕回国，引颈就戮，这就是你的榜样！
    如果你还有一点天良人性，你应该立即停止一切卖国行为。假使你能幡然悔悟，虚心学习，重新做人，带罪立功，将来国人或能稍予宽宥，减罪一等。
    为民为贼，幸善自图之！
