　　Strictly Enforce Regulations on the Use of Grain Coupons
    Grain Coupons are Limited to Local Exchange
    Order from the North China People's Government to Subordinates for Compliance
    [Beijing News] Recently, staff members in various localities have repeatedly violated the regulations on the use of grain coupons, exchanging grain coupons issued by their original organizations not in the place of issue, but coming to Beijing and Tianjin to request exchange or price changes. Some individuals even take the opportunity to speculate and exchange grain for private gain under false pretenses. This behavior not only violates government orders but also affects the grain supply plan of Beijing and Tianjin. In order to eliminate this illegal behavior, the North China People's Government hereby orders its subordinates that from now on, all grain coupons received by personnel under the supply system must only be exchanged for grain in their place of residence. Subsistence rice and infant care rice will be priced locally and cash will be received. If work requires relocation to Beijing or Tianjin, only the necessary grain coupons are allowed to be carried. For agencies implementing the salary system, it is strictly forbidden to issue salaries in the form of grain coupons. Violators will be severely punished.

　　严格执行粮票使用规章
    粮票只限就地兑换
    华北人民政府令所属遵办
    【北京讯】近来各地工作人员屡有违反粮票使用规章，将原机关所发粮票不在原地兑粮，而来京、津要求兑粮或变价，甚至个别有假借名义投机取巧，套换粮食，牟取私利者。此种行为不但违犯政令，且影响京、津粮秣供应计划。华北人民政府为肃清此种非法行为，特令所属，今后凡供给制人员领取之粮票，一律限在驻地兑粮。抚恤米、婴儿保育米就地作价领款。如工作调往京、津，只准携带所需粮票。至实行薪金制机关，一律禁止以粮票代发薪资。违者将予严惩。
