　　【Beijing News】More than six thousand Muslims from all walks of life in the capital held a grand meeting yesterday (2nd) to celebrate the founding of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China. At the meeting, a congratulatory telegram to Chairman Mao was unanimously adopted. Muslim representatives who attended the People's Political Consultative Conference, including Liu Geping, Wu Hongbin, Yang Jingren, Bai Shouyi, and Ma Jian, were invited to attend and speak. In his speech, Liu Geping, the chief representative of minority nationalities, made a strong comparison between the ethnic policies formulated in the Common Program of the People's Political Consultative Conference and the reactionary policies of Great Han chauvinism during the Kuomintang rule. He pointed out: Today, the government recognizes us as a nationality, and a new era and a new life for our Hui people have begun. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Hui people must actively participate in production and construction, unite with all nationalities, and build a new China. Wu Hongbin, a representative of the Hui people in the Northwest, pointed out in his speech that thanks to the correct leadership of the Communist Party and the revolutionary war, we have achieved today's great victory. Today, the Hui people in the Northwest and the Hui people in the inland have been closely united. In the future, all nationalities must unite even more closely, and the Hui people must take the lead in uniting closely with all nationalities to carry out construction work. Yang Jingren said: The People's Political Consultative Conference is a truly equal meeting for all nationalities. Chapter VI of the Common Program of the People's Political Consultative Conference specifically stipulates ethnic policies and establishes the principle of ethnic equality. This is the result of the efforts of all Chinese nationalities. I guarantee that the Common Program of the People's Political Consultative Conference will be thoroughly implemented throughout the country. Professors Bai Shouyi and Ma Jian emphasized: Everyone must conscientiously implement the Common Program and celebrate with action. Finally, Ma Yuhuai, director of the Beijing Municipal Hui People's Work Committee, spoke, pointing out: The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has been established. In the close unity and common work of the Hui people with all nationalities, we must overcome narrow-minded nationalism, gradually change backward modes of production, and strengthen the unity among brothers of all nationalities.
