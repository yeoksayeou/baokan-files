Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 1st, TASS New York, September 30th: The United Nations General Assembly Steering Committee discussed on September 28th the proposal by the Kuomintang government representative to include the issue of "threats to the political independence and territorial integrity of China and threats to peace in the Far East" on the agenda of the General Assembly.

The first to speak was Jiang Tingfu, the representative of the Kuomintang. He did not offer any facts or reasons to support the proposal to have the General Assembly discuss this issue. The representative of this bankrupt reactionary group, which has lost the trust of the people and been driven out of most of China's territory by the people, did not offer any evidence to support his fabrications, because such "evidence" simply does not exist. He insisted that the Soviet Union violated the treaty it signed with China on August 14, 1945. He proposed including this deceptive trick of the Kuomintang on the agenda of the General Assembly.

Soviet delegation leader Vyshinsky presented substantial and powerful reasons to refute this slanderous and deceptive trick. He pointed out that when the Kuomintang government representative proposed this deceptive trick, he did not bother to present any arguments or factual materials to support this deception. This type of argument or factual material would allow the committee to judge whether it was necessary to discuss this issue, and whether such a discussion would be harmful or dangerous. The Kuomintang representative's tactic was harmful and dangerous, because if this tactic were followed, anyone who wanted to do so could come to the General Assembly, without providing any evidence, and force the General Assembly to discuss groundless and slanderous deceptions.

The Kuomintang representative completely refused to provide any evidence before the issue was placed on the agenda. He thought he did not need to provide any evidence at all. Even without any basis, he was satisfied as long as he made his accusation. However, he forgot that he was speaking in the United Nations General Assembly, in a committee of the United Nations General Assembly. Before deciding whether to include an issue on the agenda, there must be a basis for making a decision. No one can agree to the procedure proposed by the Kuomintang representative. This is not a procedure, but a mockery of the rational and honest attitude that should be taken when discussing issues.

Vyshinsky said that the Kuomintang's deceptive trick has its reasons, and some people want to cover up these reasons, but the Kuomintang representative cannot cover them up. This slanderous attack was prompted by the most despicable motives of the bankrupt warlord group in China. This group has been rejected by the Chinese people, and the vast majority of the Chinese people have refused to trust these gentlemen and driven this group out of most of their country. These gentlemen are trying to resort to despicable and filthy anti-Soviet malice, distortions, and slanders, trying to blame others for the faults that caused their bankruptcy.

　　国民党匪帮代表无耻诽谤苏联
    维辛斯基痛斥蒋廷黻
    国民党军阀破产是由于中国人民的力量卑鄙的反苏恶意歪曲掩盖不了可耻失败
    【新华社北京一日电】塔斯社纽约三十日电：联合国大会指导委员会于九月二十八日讨论了国民党政府代表所提将“对中国政治独立与领土完整的威胁和对远东和平的威胁”问题列入大会议程的建议。
    首先发言的是国民党的代表蒋延黻，他没有提出丝毫的事实或理由来支持要求大会讨论这个问题的建议。这个失去了人民的信任并被人民逐出了中国大部分领土的破产反动分子集团的代表，没有提出丝毫证据来支持他的捏造，因为这种“证据”根本就不存在。他坚持说：苏联违犯了它在一九四五年八月十四日与中国签订的条约。他建议将国民党的这一欺骗的勾当列入大会议程。
    苏联代表团团长维辛斯基提出内容充实的有力的理由，驳斥了这种诽谤的欺骗勾当。他指出：国民党政府代表在提出这个欺骗勾当时，他并没有费神提出丝毫的论据或者事实材料来支持这个欺骗。这种论据或事实材料，可以使委员会能以判断：讨论这个问题是否有必要，这种讨论是不是有害处，有危险。国民党代表采取这种行动的伎俩是有害处的和危险的，因为如果效法这种伎俩，任何一个人只要他想要这样作，他就可以到大会来，不须提出任何证据，就可以逼迫大会讨论毫无根据的、诽谤他人的欺骗勾当。
    国民党代表在这个问题未列入议程以前，完全拒绝提出任何证据。他以为他根本不必要提出任何证据。即使没有任何根据，但是对于他来说，只要提出了他的控告他就满足了。可是，他忘记了他是在联合国大会，在联合国大会的委员会说话。它们在决定是否要将一个问题列入议程之前，是必须要有作决定的根据的。国民党代表所建议的这种程序，是谁也不能同意的。这不是一种程序，而是对讨论问题的程序所应有的合理而正直的态度开玩笑。
    维辛斯基说：国民党的欺骗勾当的来由是有它的原因的，有人想掩盖这种原因，但国民党的代表掩盖不了。这一毁谤的攻击是由于中国破产军阀集团的最卑鄙的动机所促成的。这一个集团已为中国人民所摈斥，中国人民绝大多数都拒绝信任这些先生们，把这个集团从他们国家的大部地区驱逐出去了。这些先生们企图乞灵于反对苏联的卑鄙龌龊的恶意歪曲和毁谤，企图把他们所以破产的过错推诿给别人。
