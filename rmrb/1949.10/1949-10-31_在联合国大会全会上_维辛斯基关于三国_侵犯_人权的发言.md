　　TASS, New York: Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky delivered the following speech at the plenary session of the United Nations General Assembly on the 21st:

　　The speakers before me have each tried to prove the correctness of their positions in their own way. In my opinion, it would be embarrassing for the General Assembly to adhere to such a method, when each speaker must analyze everything said by the previous speaker. Nevertheless, this should be given some attention, especially when it involves discussions that are somewhat general and, I would even say, principled.

　　That is why I think it is necessary to elaborate on Mr. Cohen's speech, in which he exposed some bizarre theories of cooperation. It seems that whenever a country refuses to obey the orders of the U.S. government, it means refusing to cooperate. Conversely, according to Mr. Cohen, cooperation is nothing more than a commitment to the demands made by the group of countries led by the United States. I say this is a very bizarre theory, which essentially reverses the correct concept of cooperation.

　　Later I will try to prove that this is precisely the case in the matter of the slander against Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania for allegedly infringing upon human rights and fundamental freedoms, violating peace treaties, and international obligations.

　　For example, Cohen said here that these three countries refused to attend the General Assembly or the United Nations to jointly discuss issues that cause some suspicion or dissatisfaction. As a result, when (for example) the question of approving the admission of Bulgaria or Hungary or Romania to the United Nations is raised, it is thought that it is not necessary to invite them, not necessary to allow them to join the United Nations; but when it is necessary to subject them to vile slander and all sorts of rude and unfair attacks, they are invited: "Please come to our United Nations to listen to our slanderous attacks, and please give us an explanation."

　　In fact, Mr. Cohen, can any self-respecting country accept such an invitation?

　　When others call you and hurl abuse at you, and you respond, can this possibly prove your desire for cooperation?

　　The U.S. representative calls the rejection of this suggestion a refusal to cooperate. This kind of cooperation talk is pure and absolute hypocrisy. Under the guise of cooperation, the United States demands that others obey its orders. You will never get this kind of cooperation from us. The representatives of the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia have been particularly active in trying to use violations of rights and freedoms as the basis for slanderous arguments. Many representatives here are familiar with the materials cited here by Messrs. Cohen, Shawcross, and Makin, and they have even attempted to invoke certain documents. But all these efforts have completely failed. Under the attacks of those countries that oppose this Anglo-American-Australian provocation, the arguments that the slanderers attempted to invoke have been completely shattered. We have elaborated on our position in detail in the Special Committee. We have cited several documents proving that the cries against Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania are completely unfounded, and proving that the so-called facts presented against them are purely distortions and fabrications. It has been proven that there is absolutely no basis for condemning Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania for infringing upon human rights and fundamental freedoms. However, the majority in the Special Political Committee passed a resolution that is now submitted to the General Assembly for consideration. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze this unreasonable slander, which is unworthy of the United Nations, again.

　　The crusade against the people's democratic systems of Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania is planned and carried out along three main lines: first, the slanderous arguments about the so-called infringement of human rights and fundamental freedoms by the governments of the aforementioned three countries; second, similar arguments about violations of peace treaties; and third, similar arguments about violations of international obligations.

　　I assert that the accusers have absolutely no evidence on any of these three points, based on which it could be said: "Yes, guilty." But I don't even want to defend myself here. On the contrary, the Soviet delegation appears here as the accuser of the accusers. In order to prove the so-called infringement of human rights and fundamental freedoms by Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania, the political systems established in these countries due to the victory of people's democracy have been attacked. In order to prove the correctness of their slanderous lies, the gentlemen of the Anglo-American camp have mentioned the trial cases of Petkov, Mindszenty, and Maniu. Shawcross has tried in every way to discredit these trials. Therefore, he has presented piles of stale so-called "facts" that have been refuted and exposed as absolute fabrications and despicable slanders countless times, and these "facts" actually have no real material at all, and are lies and deceptions from beginning to end. In order to undermine the credibility of the judicial departments of the people's democratic countries, and thus prove the infringement of human rights, the British representative seized the opportunity in a news release on October 6 to say that in these countries, people generally arrested for political reasons are never tried unless they confess before the trial, and these so-called confessions present ominous scenes. In fact, he apparently realized that he had gone too far, and in his speech on October 12, he decided to correct himself, saying that of course this is not the case in all trials, but in most trials—even in the vast majority of trials. According to Shawcross, these confessions were made under coercion. Shawcross humbled himself to such an extent that he began to repeatedly engage in market chatter, talking about "psychological laboratories," certain "secret rooms," and the so-called "psychological pressure" that the defendants suffered during the trial. However, the slanderers did not cite a single fact to prove their assertions, because they did not have such facts, because such facts do not exist.

　　Frankly, when I listened to Shawcross speak, I was wondering: Have I accidentally stumbled into the Pickwick Club? Is this the British Attorney General holding forth, or is it the respectable Mr. Pickwick himself who is talking eloquently, bewildering the audience with all kinds of exaggerated—albeit more harmless—stories? Could this be a nightmare? Heavens! This is not a dream, this is reality. In fact, this is the British Attorney General, letting loose his arrows at the people's democratic countries, while praising "mature legal systems," such as the British system, according to which, according to Shawcross, the court treats the defendant's confession with great caution. Is that so, Mr. Shawcross? No, that's not so. In this "mature legal system," such as in the British system mentioned by Shawcross, the situation is quite different. Here, too, Shawcross confuses the issue, or simply distorts the facts. In fact, it is precisely in England that the defendant's confession of guilt plays a decisive part in the trial. In the Middle Ages, there was a rule: "The defendant's confession is the most important proof." In fact, in English law, this rule has remained unchanged. In this regard, the British Attorney General can recall a section from the Harris textbook: Principles of Criminal Law and its Implementation (London, 1943 edition, page 430, English version), which states: If the defendant pleads guilty, then there is no need for proof or interrogation, and the court shall pronounce a decision based on "the defendant's personal confession." In Stephen's Digest (one of the outstanding authoritative journals in the British legal profession), you can see the following section on the defendant's plea of guilty: If the defendant pleads guilty in court, that is the end of the case, and no further investigation is needed, but a sentence is pronounced immediately after the confession. From this, it can be seen that the defendant's confession outweighs everything, and that is why it is so important to obtain the defendant's confession (whatever it may be) in this type of court. Shawcross also did not miss the opportunity to mention the Soviet Union in this regard, daring to repeat the nonsense about the cases that occurred in Moscow about fifteen years ago, this nonsense was selected from slanderers such as the well-known Vansittart and his first-class gentlemen. No people's democratic law would include anything similar to the British medieval law—which actually distorts judicial work and actually violates human rights. And this is not accidental: Several British scientists, such as Sayer, criticized the rules of British litigation procedures, saying: These rules, for the most part, are presented as a pile of various empty dogmas and expressed in vague English or Latin phrases, and are hastily applied with half-baked knowledge, without understanding their essence, which is good and correct in appropriate circumstances, but due to indiscriminate application, it has false interpretations and wrong meanings.

　　Vyshinsky continued: One can imagine how all this affects the human rights of anyone who falls into the hands of so-called fairness! That is why it is somewhat unsettling to hear Shawcross (Shawcross, who, due to his position as the British Attorney General, must be caught in the quagmire of this type of medieval judicial rule when he presides over British courts) trying to lecture the people's democratic countries in the Political Committee of the United Nations about what "true justice" and the true attitude towards the defendant's confession are. But this is superfluous labor, because in Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania, litigation procedures do not know what this type of medieval British law is, and this type of litigation procedure is built on a democratic basis. Here, the court considers the case according to the procedures determined by law, and this procedure is determined on the basis of judicial proof, in which the defendant's confession is not regarded as more important than any other proof. Here, the defendant's confession is not only not the sole basis for the court to find the defendant guilty, but it is not even the main basis. In democratic countries, the court strictly adheres to this principle and makes judgments based on all the evidence. The attempt by Shawcross and Cohen to slander the justice of the people's democratic countries by using the issue of the defendant's confession can be considered to have failed. This "proof" of Shawcross and his friends is of no avail.

　　After failing in this, Shawcross grabbed another "proof" that was also destined to fail. He said that the Hungarian Minister of Justice had said somewhere, sometime (but he did not say where or when): One of the methods of bearing witness in Hungary is the defendant's political stance. The meaning of this statement is also to slander the Hungarian court and describe its activities as a means of carrying out political purges. That is to say: In Hungary, people are tried not because they have committed crimes, but because of their political views. But this is the same old lie, which has been convincingly exposed in the Mindszenty trial; Mindszenty has been found guilty of specific crimes such as conspiring to overthrow the legitimate government of Hungary, espionage, and treason. Mindszenty's guilt was proven in the trial not only by his own confession of the crimes he committed, but also by irrefutable evidence such as the iron box unearthed in the basement of Mindszenty's residence; this iron box contained a list of members of the future government that would inevitably take office under the leadership of Mindszenty and his Anglo-American masters after the legitimate existing government of Hungary was overthrown by force.

　　Please ask: Is this a fact, or is it a fabrication out of thin air? This is a fact. This box and these documents written by Mindszenty himself occupied a prominent position in the trial. This is an undeniable fact, this is convincing evidence of Mindszenty's crime, because the physical evidence is irrefutable, because the fact remains the fact, the list is the list, and Mindszenty's hand that compiled this list is Mindszenty's hand.

　　No matter what tricks are played, it is of no avail here, because these are the facts that undeniably prove the truth.

　　Therefore, all assertions that the defendant's political stance is the main thing in Hungary and other people's democratic countries are slanderous fabrications.

　　But there really are countries where, in crimes of violating state secrets, no evidence is needed, and even the defendant's confession is unnecessary, and what is legally called "personality characteristics" is enough. What country is this? This is Great Britain. What law is this? This is the law of August 22, 1911. What does this law say? I quote and read this law as follows: In cases involving state secrets, it is not necessary to prove certain definite actions threatening the security of national interests in order to determine the guilt of the defendant….

　　It seems absolutely clear that the British court can sentence the defendant according to the law of August 22, 1911, even if no specific crime has been established. It is enough to establish the so-called "personality characteristics."

　　The rules established by this law truly undermine all judicial foundations, but this is British law, not Bulgarian law, not Hungarian law, and not Romanian law! So, who are you accusing of violating human rights? In essence, these are the two most important proofs that Shawcross arrived at in the Special Political Committee. I have not mentioned all his other matters, which I think are not even worth noting. The reason why I have elaborated on these most recent issues is because these are the cornerstones of his condemnation of violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, because if the trial is based on the confession of the defendant forced to confess, then of course there can be no talk of any justice or any human rights.

　　Mr. Makin, head of the Australian delegation, this responsible person, former Australian minister, did not fall behind Shawcross in the committee. The Australian representative also contradicts the facts. To be honest, he has no facts. In this situation, an honest person does not make assertions, and an honest accuser does not make accusations. But if it is a deceitful accuser, the situation is very different. They are stubborn and engage in all kinds of tricks, even to the point of fabricating non-existent facts. And in the matter we are talking about, this is exactly what happened; Mr. Makin, because he tried to slander Romania, cited Law No. 341 of 1947 regarding people's jurors, which is said to say: "Jurors are elected by the organizations of a major political party in Romania, and no one outside of this organization has the right to participate in these elections." (Makin's speech on October 4)

　　However, there is no such thing in Law No. 341. The Soviet delegation has requested Mr. Makin to submit the original text of the law and indicate the source. The original text of Law No. 341 was submitted. But everyone can be convinced: there is no similar sentence to what Mr. Makin talked about. Isn't this deceiving by tampering with the facts?! What does the Australian representative think about this? And he must also explain a little where he got this assertion from, what he told the Political Committee based on this about the Romanian judicial organization (there is no trace of these things in the documents he publicly cited)? Does Mr. Makin not want to come to the podium and say: This is that page and that article, the original text is as follows…, and then read the sentences in Law No. 341 that say that Romanian people's jurors can actually only be communists? I say he can't do this, because there is no such law at all. And in the law he referred to (i.e., Law No. 341), there are no sentences about this. In addition to the above points, it must also be said: Generally speaking, Law No. 341 was abolished as early as April 1, 1949, but even in this April law, there is nothing like what Mr. Makin asserted. But the Australian representative arbitrarily made threatening demands based on this kind of "fact" (if you are willing to say so): Some measures should be taken against the Romanian government!

　　The Soviet delegation and several other delegations have analyzed all these and other so-called "proofs" in detail and carefully in the Special Committee. It has been proven that all this ultimately boils down to a collection of false sentences, all distortions of the indisputable proposition that the court's duty includes protecting the constitution and the state and social system it establishes.

　　As examples of infringement of human rights and fundamental freedoms, Shawcross and Cohen cited: For example, Bulgaria, according to the law of August 28, 1947, the Petkov group, which had prepared a coup, was disbanded. However, even Mr. Shawcross had to admit (I quote a news release from October 6): "In the transitional period from Nazism and undemocratic systems, perhaps extraordinary measures are needed for a certain period of time." Although the law of August 28, 1947, is precisely this extraordinary measure that Shawcross publicly considered to be justified and implemented in the Special Committee, Shawcross has slandered this measure of Bulgaria, the reason is simply because this measure was implemented in Bulgaria!

　　The most noteworthy thing is that all these unjust attacks on the political system, on the judiciary, and on the so-called lack of rights and freedoms in Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania mostly come from the governments of those countries where human rights and freedoms are completely destroyed. Regarding this point, it is necessary to talk about the Australian government. From the writings of the famous Australian anthropologist Thomson, it can be seen that in many places in the Northern Territory of Australia, many indigenous people are working in conditions equivalent to slavery; in the book "Black Chattel" published in the United Kingdom, the shocking situation of the local indigenous people of Australia is also described. These indigenous people are the source of cheap labor and the victims of cruel exploitation! And look at Gardner's book "My Australia", doesn't it talk about the completely disenfranchised situation of the local indigenous people! It is strange that the Australian representative is completely unconcerned about the tragic disenfranchised situation of the Australians, but is "seriously concerned" about the so-called infringement of rights in the people's democratic countries, as the resolution of the majority in the Political Committee says! The Dutch ruling group is carrying out a war of aggression against the Indonesian people. The Dutch representative who spoke here is a typical representative of these slave owners who expressed "concern". He demanded a crusade against democratic countries, and he openly demanded that the United Nations General Assembly unite to carry out an anti-communist struggle here. Everyone knows that attempts to organize this kind of crusade against democracy and socialism have occurred in the past. People can recall the attempt by the reactionary group led by Churchill in capitalist countries to organize a fourteen-nation crusade against the Soviet Union, and this crusade was a complete failure. The Dutch representative can be sure that if this attempt failed thirty years ago, then it will fail even more miserably now. It is truly a heaven-knows-what sight for slave owners and their masters to play the role of democratic mentors and defenders of human rights and fundamental freedoms for other truly advanced democratic countries.

　　It is precisely in Australia that the Federal Criminal Law completely destroys rights and freedoms, deprives citizens of the right to trial by jury, deprives the defendant of the right to ask questions and answer questions to the prosecutor, and at this time to listen to the Australian representative talking about the judiciary of Romania is a shame!

　　Regarding this point, it is necessary to talk about Greece, its fascist terror, its barbaric torture and execution of patriotic people; it is necessary to talk about the United States and its so-called "human rights", its human rights are demonstrated in Peekskill and other places in the United States, or by Judge Medina. Judge Medina even deprived the defendant of the right to defense, he not only hastily convicted the defendant, but also convicted the defendant's defense lawyer! Regarding this point, it is necessary to talk about the United Kingdom, which massacred peaceful demonstrators—for example, in Somaliland… it is necessary to talk about the wanton propaganda of new wars and mass extermination of people carried out in the United Kingdom and the United States; it is necessary to talk about the United Kingdom giving freedom of speech to fascists, etc. One cannot but notice Cohen's speech here, in which he said that the United States could not accept the proposal put forward by the Soviet Union against the preparation of a new war and the conclusion of a five-power treaty to strengthen peace.

　　The proposal to strengthen peace is naturally unacceptable to those who are preparing for war. We will certainly take this into consideration. This is the answer that must be given to those accusers who play the role of moral preachers and mentors, a role that is rare for them. The British prosecutors who preach democracy, freedom, and human rights at the General Assembly can be reminded, for example, to remind him of the sensational trial of the most advanced leader of the Indian trade union movement, which was described by the British magazine "New Leader" at the time as the biggest scandal in political persecution and the most shameful scandal in the history of world justice! In order to clarify things, all these should be reminded to all the accuser gentlemen.

　　When the Special Committee discussed the human rights issues in Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania, there were many defamatory attacks, many fabrications and falsifications of facts. There was only one thing missing, and that was the facts that could slightly confirm the slander against these three people's democratic countries. This kind of fact is still lacking now.

　　The truth about the so-called infringement of rights and fundamental freedoms by Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania is just like this.

　　This infringement does not exist. Therefore, it is ridiculous to attempt to invoke the treaty provisions that talk about human rights and fundamental freedoms, but say that they were violated by Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania, because criminals—conspirators, terrorists, spies, and traitors against the new democratic system—were caught on the spot, tried, and punished according to law, that is, to invoke Article 2 of the Treaty with Bulgaria and Article 3 of the Treaty with Romania. It is as if these clauses of the treaty meant to protect the "right" to commit crimes or the "freedom" to commit crimes. At the same time, there is no mention of Article 4 of the Treaty with Bulgaria and Article 5 of the Treaty with Romania, which directly task the governments of Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania with preventing the existence and activities of fascist organizations that aim to deprive the people of democratic rights and engage in propaganda and hostility against the Soviet Union and any other United Nations. However, it is well known that all those Petkovites, Lulchevites, Szálasiites, Tsankovites and followers of Mindszenty, etc., can be completely classified into these clauses.

　　The truth about the so-called violation of the treaty by the governments of Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania is just like this. This violation does not exist. This violation is purely fabricated in order to find a little excuse for the crusade against these three people's democratic countries, which is organized according to all the laws of barbarism, and it hides all the arbitrary actions and lawlessness. This barbaric law is well described in Krylov's famous fable "The Wolf and the Lamb": "Your fault is that I want to eat."

　　They intend to use fabrication and slander, deception and falsification of facts as an excuse to interfere in the internal affairs of Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania. This is not the first time. We also remember how the U.S. and British governments sought opportunities to interfere in the internal affairs of these countries in the past. We also remember, for example, how the National Assembly elections originally scheduled for August 26, 1947, were postponed as a result of the U.S. government's interference in Bulgaria's internal affairs; how the U.S. and Britain sought to install Petkovites and Szálasiites in the Bulgarian and Romanian governments in 1945-46; how they attempted to protect the crimes of the Petkov group; and similar attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of Hungary. All these events are using the conspiratorial and treasonous groups in these countries.

　　All this is because the U.S. and British ruling groups are concerned about avoiding the collapse of the capitalist system in the East European countries, because these countries are following the path of true democratic reform. These ruling groups, colluding with the remnants of the capitalist reactionaries crushed by the people's democratic movements in these countries, are attempting to obstruct the process of consolidating the people's democratic system and the victorious advance of these countries along the socialist road.

　　The establishment of people's democracy and people's democratic countries, as evidenced by irrefutable facts, is the result of the Soviet Union's historically significant victory in the Second World War and the defeat of German fascist forces, and the result of the struggle of the masses under the leadership of the working class to achieve national liberation and independence. Their establishment has enabled the countries of Eastern and Southeastern Europe to break away from the capitalist system. People's democratic countries are countries in a transitional period responsible for ensuring the development of these countries along the socialist road. The reactionary groups in capitalist countries are unwilling to reconcile themselves to this fact. The people's democratic system has replaced the old economic and political relations based on capitalism in these countries (referring to people's democratic countries - editor's note), and they are trying every means to oppose the consolidation of this people's democratic system, and they dream of reversing the wheels of history, or at least obstructing its progress. That is why the issue of human rights in Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania (the issue that must provide a camouflage for interfering in the internal affairs of these countries) is raised in the General Assembly, and these camouflages are what all the plans of Anglo-American monopoly capitalists rely on. In order to camouflage, they rely on the obvious distortion of the UN Charter, and rely on the tyrannical falsification of facts, such as attempting to invoke Article 55 of the Charter—although anyone can easily know that Article 55 of the Charter does not stipulate any right to interfere in the internal affairs of independent countries. The Soviet representative has cited excerpts from the records of the San Francisco Conference to prove that the invocation of Article 55 of the Charter is completely unfounded. As is well known, when Article 55 of the Charter was drafted, special consideration was given to this issue, and the following decision was made in San Francisco: "Chapter IX of the Charter (including Article 55) shall not be interpreted as conferring on the organization (referring to the United Nations organization - editor's note) the power to intervene in the internal affairs of member states. Moreover, on June 25, 1945, the U.S. delegation attending the San Francisco Conference stated in a report to the U.S. President: There was an opinion at the conference that the Australian suggestion that countries take measures outside of international organizations exceeded the scope of the charter of international organizations, and might even constitute an infringement on the domestic jurisdiction of member states by imposing certain concepts of government-private relations on member states.

　　Finally, the obligation that was adopted was aimed at excluding the possibility of this interpretation. This obligation requires each country to cooperate with the United Nations with joint and separate measures to achieve the economic and social goals of the United Nations, without violating the right of each country to conduct its national affairs according to its own capabilities, in its own way, and in accordance with its own political and economic institutions and procedures.

　　According to this, the report pointed out that the Charter opened the door to international cooperation on an unprecedented scale in economic, social and related aspects. At the same time, the Charter protects the right of countries to live in their own way and to be free from all improper interference.

　　Finally, there are some issues that are as important politically as they are legally. These issues have received considerable attention from the representatives of the United States and the United Kingdom in particular. These issues are directly related to the part of the construction that requires the International Court of Justice to provide advisory opinions.

　　The first question is about the so-called existence of a dispute. The representatives of the United States and the United Kingdom stubbornly insist that there is a so-called dispute in the situation we are talking about. But the question comes—what do they think of when they talk about disputes? What kind of dispute do they exactly think about? A dispute between what country and what country? If we cite the relevant provisions in the treaty, namely Article 37 of the Treaty with Romania, Article 35 of the Treaty with Bulgaria, and Article 39 of the Treaty with Hungary, undoubtedly the treaty has foreseen the possible disputes between the two sides (Romania, Bulgaria or Hungary on one side, and the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union on the other side). According to the treaty, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union represent the Allied and Associated Powers when dealing with all the above-mentioned countries in all matters relating to the implementation and interpretation of these treaties.

　　The treaty has therefore foreseen the situation where disputes may actually occur between the two sides. The correctness of these precepts is also emphasized by the provisions in the above-mentioned clauses, which determine under what circumstances the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union should act in agreement. Therefore, there can be no situation in which the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union do not act unanimously, but one of them makes demands on Romania, Hungary, or Bulgaria. Therefore, in a possible dispute, such as the treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania concerning the implementation and interpretation of these treaties foresee, the point of contention may be the differences between the governments of the above-mentioned countries (one side) and the three major powers (one side). In this way, this rule excludes the possibility of one or even two of these three countries acting alone, because in this case, there will be no concerted action by the three countries. However, it is precisely in this case that there is no such agreement, because the Soviet Union has not seen any violations in Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania's implementation and interpretation of the treaty, and the reason why the Soviet Union has not discovered them is because these violations simply do not exist. On the contrary, the governments of Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania are very honestly and quickly implementing the treaty, and do not allow any deviations in the implementation of the treaty. Since this is the current situation, there is no basis to say that there is any dispute between the parties stipulated in the treaty. Therefore, there is no reason to seek an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice on the question of the existence of a dispute, which is stipulated in Article 36 of the Treaty with Bulgaria, Article 40 of the Treaty with Hungary, and Article 38 of the Treaty with Romania.

　　As a result, the second question on the agenda, concerning the responsibility of the governments of Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania to appoint their representatives to attend the committee for disputes, should be considered to have been eliminated.

　　From the above, it should be clear that the procedures stipulated in Article 36 of the Treaty with Bulgaria, Article 38 of the Treaty with Romania, and Article 40 of the Treaty with Hungary for resolving disputes are also completely inapplicable to this situation. I repeat: the procedures stipulated in these clauses are for those disputes with the U.S., Britain, and the Soviet Union as one side, and Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania as the other side. As mentioned earlier, this is not the current situation, because the side that should be composed of three countries only includes two countries—the United States and the United Kingdom. And the third country, the Soviet Union, is categorically opposed to making any demands against Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania on the matter of so-called treaty violations.

　　Then, submitting the third question, namely the right of the Secretary-General to appoint a mediator as stipulated in the corresponding clauses of the treaty, to the International Court of Justice is also unfounded. It can be seen from the original text of these clauses that the situations referred to are not individual countries within one side, but the entire three countries that constitute this side. If one of these three countries—the U.S., Britain, and the Soviet Union—is missing from this side, then it is not one side in the legal sense of the word, and all attempts to turn the three-country side into a two-country side by using various complicated explanations and jurisprudential sophistry clearly distort the spirit and letter of the aforementioned treaty.

　　From this, a direct conclusion is also drawn, that is, the fourth question recommended to be submitted to the International Court of Justice has completely gone bankrupt. This is the question of whether the committee is qualified to resolve disputes even if it is ultimately composed not of three members (i.e., the representatives of both sides and the mediator) but of the representatives of one side—two members and the mediator.

　　The act of raising this question itself is absolutely inadmissible, because in this way we are clearly taking a risk in words, and it is detrimental to legal logic and common sense. Therefore, it is no coincidence that the French representative in the Special Committee refused to support the third and fourth questions in view of their obvious violation of jurisprudence and extraordinary political ignorance. But I must tell the French representative—if you reject the third and fourth questions, then logically, you must reject the first and second questions, because the first and second questions are the basis of the fourth and third questions, and the third and fourth questions only complete the entire matter. We have pointed out to the Political Committee that submitting questions of this type to the International Court of Justice is a degradation for both the International Court of Justice and the General Assembly, and it seems unnecessary to cite further proof for this. The attention of the General Assembly must be drawn to this point, and efforts must be made to prevent the General Assembly from taking this step, which can only degrade it. But in essence, the very discussion of the so-called issue of the infringement of human rights and fundamental freedoms by the governments of Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania, which is imposed on the General Assembly, degrades the General Assembly. From all the above, it should be clear that the unreasonable slander campaign against the three people's democratic countries, like the agenda submitted to the General Assembly for consideration by the majority in the Political Committee, follows suspicious purposes.

　　The Soviet delegation opposes this agenda and firmly advocates rejecting this agenda, because passing this kind of resolution will encourage the slanderers and forgers who infringe upon the sovereignty of independent democratic countries. This is inadmissible.

　　在联合国大会全会上　
    维辛斯基关于三国“侵犯”人权的发言
    塔斯社纽约讯：苏联外长维辛斯基在二十一日举行的联合国大会全会上发表如下演说：
    在我之前的发言者，各用其自己的方法，企图证实他们的立场之正确。依我看来，当每个发言者都一定要分析其前一个发言者所说的每一件事的时候，墨守这样一种方法，对联大来说，会是难堪的。虽然如此，这也应该予以一定的注意，尤其是当它牵涉这种多少有着一般性而我说甚至有着原则性的议论的时候。
    这就是我何以认为必须详论柯亨先生的演说的原因，他在这里暴露了某些对合作的怪诞的理论。某个国家不论什么时候拒绝服从美国政府的命令，这似乎就意味着拒绝合作。而反之，照柯亨先生的话说，合作不是别的，只是承诺那些以美国为首的国家集团所提出的要求。我说这是十分怪诞的理论，实质上把合作的正确概念弄颠倒了。
    往后我将设法证明：在关于诽谤保、匈、罗所谓侵犯人权与基本自由、违反和约及国际义务这一件事情上，情形恰恰就是如此。
    例如柯亨在这里说，这三个国家拒绝出席联大，或联合国共同研讨那些引起某种怀疑或不满意的问题。结果是：当（比如说）关于批准保加利亚或匈牙利或罗马尼亚加入联合国的问题被提出来的时候，以为不必邀请它们，不必允许它们加入联合国；但当使它们遭受下流的诽谤和种种无礼的不公平的攻击是必要的时候，则邀请它们：“请光临我们的联合国来倾听我们的诽谤攻击，并请给我们解释”。
    实际上，柯亨先生，任何一个自尊的国家能够接受这样的邀请吗？
    当别人呼唤你，肆口谩骂你，你应声而来，这难道就可能证明其合作的心愿了吗？
    拒绝这种建议，美国代表称之为拒绝合作。这种关于合作的论调是纯粹而绝对的伪善。在合作的口实下，美国要求别人服从它的命令。你永不会得到我们这方面的这种合作。美国、英国及澳国的代表表示特别卖力，力图以侵犯权利和自由作为诽谤性论调的基础。在此地的许多代表，都熟悉柯亨、萧克洛斯及马金三位先生在这里所引证的材料，他们甚至企图援引某些文件。但是所有这些努力都完全失败了。在那些反对这一英美澳挑衅的国家底抨击之下，诽谤者企图援引的立论，完全被粉碎了。我们已在特别委员会详细论述我们的立场。我们已引证若干文件，证明对保、匈、罗的叫嚣全无根据，证明提出反对它们的所谓事实纯系曲解与全属捏造。业已证明，谴责保、匈、罗侵犯人权和基本自由是绝无根据的。然而，特别政治委员会的多数方面却通过了现在提交联大考虑的决议。因此，必须再来分析这种为联合国所不屑的无理诽谤。
    对保匈罗三国人民民主制度的十字军，是按着三条主要方针来计划和进行的：一、对于上述三国政府的所谓侵犯人权和基本自由的诽谤性论调，这是第一条方针；二、关于违背和约的类似的论调，这是第二条方针；三、关于违背国际义务的类似论调，这是第三条方针。
    我断言谴责者绝对没有关于这三条中任何一条的证据，根据这些证据才可能说：“是的，有罪。”但是，我甚至不想在这里为我自己辩护。相反的，苏联代表团是以控诉者之控诉者的身分出现在这里的。为了证明保匈罗三国所谓侵犯人权和基本自由起见，已向这些国家中由于人民民主的胜利而建立起来的政治制度开火了。为了证实他们的诽谤性谰言之正确起见，英美阵营的绅士们便提到彼得科夫、明曾蒂及马尼乌的审判案。萧克洛斯企图以各种办法来诋毁这些审判。因此，他提出了成堆陈腐不堪的、不知多少次地被驳倒和被揭露为绝对虚构和卑鄙的诽谤的所谓“事实”，而这些“事实”，实际上没有丝毫真实材料，是从头到尾都是谎言与欺瞒事实的。为了破坏人民民主国家司法部门的信誉，并这样来证明侵犯人权，英国代表曾在十月六日发布的新闻中抓住机会说，在这些国家里，一般因政治理由而被捕的人，如果他们不在审讯之前服罪的话，从不审判，而且这些所谓供认提出了不吉利的景象。事实上，他显然了解他走得太远了，在十月十二日的演说中便决定矫正他自己，他说当然不是在所有的审判中都是这样的，而是在大部分审判中——甚至在绝大部分审判中是这样的。据萧克洛斯说，这些供认是在胁迫之下造成的。萧克洛斯自卑到这种程度，以至他开始反复从事市场上的空谈，说什么“心理实验室”，某种“密室”和被告在审讯时所谓遭受的某种“心理压力”。然而诽谤者并未引证一件事实来证明他们的断言，因为他们没有这种事实，因为这种事实并不存在。
    坦白地讲，当我听萧克洛斯讲话的时候，我在思索着：莫非我意外地撞进匹克威克俱乐部了么？这是英国的总检察官在高谈阔论或者是可敬的匹克威克先生本人在滔滔议论，用各种各样夸大的——虽然更属无害的故事——来迷惑听众么？这可能是一个恶梦吗？天啊！这不是梦，这是现实。事实上，这是英国总检察官，自己放出箭矢射向人民民主国家，同时则称赞“成熟的法律制度”，例如英国的制度，根据它，据萧克洛斯说，法庭很慎重地看待被告的供认。是这样么，萧克洛斯先生？不，不是这样的。在这种“成熟的法律制度”里，例如在象萧克洛斯所提到的英国制度里，事态却是十分不同的。这里，萧克洛斯也混淆了问题，或者简直歪曲事实。事实上，恰恰是在英国，被告供认有罪一层在审讯中起着决定性的作用。在中世纪，有过这样的规则：“被告的供认是最重要的证明。”实际上，在英国法律中，这条规则一直保持不变。在这一方面，英国的总检察官可以想起哈立斯课本中的一部分：刑法之原则及其实施（伦敦，一九四三年版，第四三○页，英文本），内称：如被告服罪，那么就不再需要证明或讯问，而且法庭就要根据“被告的亲自供认”宣布决定。在斯蒂芬文摘（英国司法界杰出的权威杂志之一）里，可以看到下面关于被告服罪的部分：在法庭上如果被告服罪，那就是案件的结束，不需再有什么调查，而是在供认后立即宣判。从此看出，这就是被告的供认重于一切，而且这就是在这类法庭中取得被告供认（无论是什么也好）一点何以如此重要的原因。萧克洛斯也不错过在这一方面提到苏联的机会，敢于重复关于约十五年前在莫斯科发生过的案子的胡说八道，这种胡说八道，是从诸如众所周知的凡西塔特及其一流绅士们这些诽谤者中选择出来的。没有一种人民民主的法律会包括任何类似于英国中世纪法律——它实际上是歪曲司法工作，实际上是违反人权的——的东西。而且这不是偶然的：若干英国科学家，例如塞耶，批评英国诉讼程序的规则说：这些规则，大部分表现为一堆各式各样的空洞的教条而用含糊其辞的英文语句或拉丁语句表达出来，一知半解地就草率地加以应用，并不了解它们的要旨，这些要旨在适当的情况下是好的正确的，但是由于毫无差别的应用，就具有错误的解释和错误的意思。
    维辛斯基继称：一个人能够想象到这一切是怎样影响着任何一个堕入所谓公平的掌握中的人的人权！这就是何以听到萧克洛斯（萧克洛斯由于处在英国总检察官的职位，当他主持英国法庭时一定要陷入这类中世纪司法规则的泥淖里）不论怎样企图在联合国大会的政治委员会里教训人民民主国家什么“真正的正义”和对被告供认的真正态度时，多少总有点不安的原因。但是这是多余的劳神，因为在保加利亚、匈牙利和罗马尼亚，诉讼程序不知这类中世纪英国法律为何物，这种诉讼程序是建筑在民主的基础上的。这里，法庭是根据着法律所确定的程序来考虑案子的，这种程序之确定是以司法的证明为基础，其中对于被告的供状，并不比任何其他的证明看得更重要些。这里，被告的供状不但不是法庭认为被告有罪的唯一的根据，而且也不是主要的根据。在民主国家里，法庭严格遵守这个原则，根据全部证据来进行判决。萧克洛斯和柯亨利用被告服罪的问题来中伤人民民主国家的正义，这种企图可以被认为是已经失败的了。萧克洛斯和他的朋友们的这个“证明”是无济于事的。
    在这上面失败之后，萧克洛斯又抓到另外一个同样注定要失败的“证明”。他说什么匈牙利司法部长曾在某地某时（他可是却不说在什么地方什么时候）说过：在匈牙利作证的方法之一便是被告的政治立场。这种说法的意思也是在于诽谤匈牙利法庭，将其活动说成是进行政治清算的途径。这就是说：在匈牙利，人们之受审不是因为犯了罪，而是因为他们的政见。但是这是老一套的说谎，这已经在明曾蒂审讯中被令人信服地揭穿了；明曾蒂已被发觉是犯了阴谋推翻匈牙利合法政府、间谍活动与叛国这类具体罪行的。明曾蒂的罪在审讯中不仅由其对所犯罪行的自供，并且也由明曾蒂住宅地下室中掘出的铁箱之类无可争辩的证据而在审讯中证明了；这个铁箱内有在武力推翻匈牙利现存合法政府后必定在明曾蒂及其英美主子领导下当政的未来政府成员的名单。
    请问：这是事实呢，还是凭空捏造？这是事实。这个箱子与明曾蒂亲笔写的这些文件，在审讯中占凸出的地位。这是无可争辩的事实，这是明曾蒂犯罪令人信服的证据，因为物证是无可争辩的，因为事实仍是事实，名单就是名单，编纂出这个名单的明曾蒂的手就是明曾蒂的手。
    不论进行什么诡计，在这里都无济于事，因为这些是无可争辩地证明真相的事实。
    因此，一切说什么在匈牙利及其他人民民主国家中，被告的政治立场是主要的，这种断言都是诽谤的捏造。
    但是却真有这样的国家，在那里，在由于违背国家机密而犯的罪状中，不需要证据，甚至被告的供辞都是不必要的，有了法律上所谓“人格特性”的东西便足够了。这是什么国家呢？这就是大不列颠。这是什么法律呢？这是一九一一年八月二十二日的法律。这项法律中说了些什么呢？我将这项法律引证宣读如下：如遇有关国家机密之案情，无需证明有威胁国家利益安全这一目的的某些确定行动，来决定被告之罪……。
    似乎是绝对明白的了，英国法庭可以依据一九一一年八月二十二日的法律判决被告，即使并未确立具体的罪行也可以。确立了所谓“其人格特性”便足够了。
    这项法律所确立的规则真正破坏了一切司法基础，但是这是英国法律，可不是保加利亚法律，也不是匈牙利法律，也不是罗马尼亚法律！那么，你们在控告谁违反人权呢？从本质上说，这些便是萧克洛斯在特别政治委员会中所得出的两个最重要的证明。我还没有提到他那所有各种其他我认为甚至不值得注意的事项。我之所以详论这些最新近的问题，是因为这些是他谴责违反人权、违反基本自由的基石，因为如果裁判是根据被告被强使供认的供辞的话，那么当然就谈不到任何公正或任何人权了。
    澳大利亚代表团团长马金先生，这位负责人、前澳大利亚部长在委员会中可并未落在萧克洛斯的后面。澳大利亚代表也与事实抵触。老实说，他没有事实。在这里情形下正直的人是不作断言的，而正直的控诉人也是不作控告的。可是如果是诡诈的控告人，情形就十分不同了。他们却顽固不化，从事各种诡计，甚至达到这样的程度，以至捏造不存在的事实。而在我们所谈的事情中，恰恰发生了这种情形；马金先生因为试图诽谤罗马尼亚，便援引关于人民陪审员的一九四七年第三四一号法律，据说这法律中说：“陪审员由罗马尼亚一个主要政党的各组织来选举，而且此种组织之外的任何人都没有权利参加这些选举。”（马金十月四日讲演）
    但是，第三四一号法律中并没有这种东西。苏联代表团曾就此要求马金先生提出该法原文，并说明出处。第三四一号法律原文被提出了。但是人人都可以信服：其中并无类似马金先生所谈到的辞句。这难道不是骗过事实进行欺诈吗！？澳大利亚代表先生对此作何想法？而他同样必须稍稍解释一下他从何处取得此一断言，他曾根据什么告诉政委会这种关于罗国司法组织的东西（在他公开引证的文件中丝毫没有关于这些东西的痕迹）？难道马金先生不愿到讲台上来讲讲：这便是那一页那一条原文如下………，然后宣读第三四一号法律中那些说罗马尼亚人民陪审员实际上只能是共产党人云云的字句。我说他就作不了这个，因为根本就没有这种法律。而且在他所指的该项法律（即第三四一号法律）中，并没有关于此点的字句。除去上述各点外，还必须说：一般说来，第三四一号法律早在一九四九年四月一日便废除了，但是就是在这项四月的法律中，也没有象马金先生所断言的那种东西。可是澳大利亚代表便是依据这种“事实”（如果你愿意这样说的话）随意提出威胁性的要求：应该对罗马尼亚政府采取若干措施！
    苏联代表团和若干其他代表团已经详尽而仔细地在特别委员会中分析了所有这些和其他的所谓“证明”。已经证明：这一切归根结底都是虚假辞句的汇集，都是曲解下述那样的无可争辩的命题，即法庭的职责包括保卫宪法及它所确定的国家与社会制度。
    作为侵犯人权和基本自由的例子，萧克洛斯与柯亨举出：例如保加利亚，根据一九四七年八月二十八日的法律，曾准备政变的彼得科夫集团被解散了。可是，甚至萧克洛斯先生也不得不承认（我引用十月六日的一个新闻稿）：“在从纳粹主义和非民主制度转变的过渡时期，或许在某一段时间须要非常的措施”。虽然一九四七年八月二十八日的法律正是萧克洛斯在特别委员会上公开认为有正当理由，予以实施的这种非常措施，而萧克洛斯却污蔑了保加利亚的这种措施，其理由很简单，那就是因为这措施是在保加利亚实施的！
    最值得注意的是：所有这些对于保匈罗政治制度的，对于司法，对于所谓保匈罗没有权利与自由的不公正的攻击，大部分出自人权和自由完全被摧残的那些国家的政府。关于这一点，必须谈谈澳洲政府，从著名的澳洲人类学家汤姆逊的著作中可以看到，在澳洲北领土有许多地方人是在等于奴隶的情况下作工；在英国所出版的“黑色动产”一书中，也可以看到，其中描写澳洲本地土民的惊人的情况，这些土民是贱价劳动的来源，和残酷剥削的牺牲品！再看看嘉德纳的“我的澳大利亚”一书，其中不是谈到本地土民的完全没有权利的情形吗！澳洲代表对于澳洲人的悲惨的毫无权利的情形竟毫不在意，而象政治委员会多数方面的决议案所说的，“严重关心”所谓人民民主国家侵犯权利的行为，这岂不奇怪吗！荷兰的统治集团对印尼人民进行侵略战争，在这里讲话的荷兰代表就是这些表示“关心”的奴隶主的典型的代表。他要求以十字军对付民主国家，他在这里公开要求联合国大会团结起来进行反共产主义斗争。大家知道，这种组织十字军反对民主与社会主义的企图，在过去曾发生过。人们可以回想到资本主义国家以邱吉尔为首的反动集团组织十四国的十字军反对苏联的企图，这个十字军惨败了。荷兰代表可以肯定，如果这种企图在三十年前失败了，那末现在会失败得更惨。奴隶主及其主子竟扮演民主导师，这对于别的真正先进民主国家的人权与基本自由的维护者的角色——真是天晓得的景象。
    恰恰是在澳洲，联邦刑法完全破坏了权利与自由，剥夺了公民由陪审团审判的权利，剥夺了被告向检察官提出问题和答复问题的权利，而在这时来听澳洲代表侈谈罗马尼亚的司法，这是一种耻辱！
    关于这一点，必须讲到希腊，它的法西斯恐怖，它的野蛮的酷刑和处死爱国人士；必须讲到美国和它的所谓“人权”，它的人权在匹克斯吉尔和美国其他地方，或者由法官麦迪纳所表明了。麦迪纳法官甚至剥夺了被告的辩护权利，他不仅仓惶地将被告定罪，而且把被告的辩护律师也一起定罪！关于这一点，必须讲到英国，它屠杀和平的示威者——例如在索马利兰……必须讲到在英美两国所进行的放肆的关于新战争和大批消灭人民的宣传；必须讲到英国给法西斯分子以言论自由等等。人们不能不注意到柯亨在这里的发言，他说苏联所提出的反对准备新战争和缔结五强条约以加强和平的提议为美国所不能接受。
    加强和平的提议，自然是准备战争的人所不能接受的。我们当然将对这一点加以考虑。这就是对于扮演对他们来说是稀罕的角色，扮演道德宣扬者与导师的角色的那些控诉人所必须给予的答复。可以提醒在联大会议上宣讲民主自由和人权的英国检察官，例如说提醒他对印度工会运动最先进领袖的哄动一时的审讯，这次审讯被英国的“新领袖”杂志当时形容为政治迫害中最大丑事，世界司法史上最可耻的丑事！为了把事情弄清楚，应该把所有这一切提醒各位控诉人先生们。
    在特别委员会讨论保匈罗人权问题的时候，多的是污蔑诽谤的攻击，多的是虚构和假造事实。就是缺少一件东西，那就是可以稍微证实对这三个人民民主国家的诽谤的事实。现在还是缺乏这种事实。
    关于所谓保匈罗侵犯权利和基本自由，事实真相就是如此。
    这种侵犯并无其事。因此企图引用谈及人权和基本自由，而因罪犯——反新民主国家制度的阴谋者、恐怖分子、间谍、卖国贼被当场捕获，受审并依法惩办，便硬说被保匈罗所违反了的那些和约条文，即引用对保匈和约第二条，对罗和约第三条，是可笑的！好象和约的这些条款意思是要保护犯罪的“权利”或犯罪的“自由”的。而同时，对于保匈和约第四条和罗国和约第五条却默无一言，这些条款直接责成保匈罗政府防止那种以剥夺人民民主权利为目的并从事宣传、而且从事敌视苏联及任何其他联合国之活动的法西斯组织的存在与活动。然而，众所周知，所有那些彼得科夫分子、卢尔捷夫分子、萨兰党人、查拉绥分子和明曾蒂的信徒者等等完全都可归入这些条款。
    所谓保匈罗政府违犯和约，事实真相就是如此。这种违犯并不存在。这种违反纯然出于捏造，为的是要多少给反对这三个人民民主国家的十字军找一点口实，这个十字军是按照野蛮法律的一切法则而组织起来的，它把所有的专断行为和毫无法纪的事情都隐蔽起来。这个野蛮法律在克里洛夫的著名的寓言“狼和羔羊”里面有很好的描写：“我肚子饿是你的过错……”。
    他们打算以捏造和诽谤，以欺诈和假造事实来作干涉保匈罗三国内政的口实。这并不是第一次了。我们还记得美国和英国政府在过去是如何力求找到机会去干涉这些国家的内政。我们还记得，例如说，如何由于美国政府干涉保国内政的结果，原订于一九四七年八月二十六日的国民议会选举被延期了；美国和英国在一九四五——四六年如何力求把彼得科夫分子和萨兰党人安插在保加利亚和罗马尼亚政府内；如何企图庇护彼得科夫集团的罪恶；以及类似这种干涉匈牙利内政的企图，所有这些事件都是利用这些国家的阴谋卖国集团。
    所有这一切，原因在于美国和英国统治集团关心于避免资本主义制度在东欧国家的崩溃，因为这些国家正在遵循着真正民主改革的道路。这些统治集团，纠合着被这些国家人民民主运动所粉碎的资本主义反动派的残余，企图阻挠人民民主制巩固的进程和这些国家沿社会主义道路的胜利的前进。
    人民民主制和人民民主国家的成立，有如不可辩驳的事实所证明了的，乃是苏联在第二次世界大战中历史意义的胜利所带来的德国法西斯势力溃败的结果，人民群众在工人阶级领导下进行争取民族解放与独立的斗争的结果。它们的成立使得东欧与东南欧国家脱离了资本主义制度。人民民主国家乃是负责保证这些国家沿社会主义道路发展的过渡时期的国家。资本主义国家的反动集团并不愿意自安于这一事实。人民民主制度在这些国家（指人民民主国家——编者）中取代了原先以资本主义为基础的旧的经济政治关系，他们正用尽各种方法，企图反对这人民民主制度的巩固，他们梦想着扭转历史的巨轮，或者，至少也要阻挠其前进。这就是为什么要在联大提出保、匈、罗三国境内的人权问题（必定是要为干涉这些国家内政提供掩饰伪装的问题）的基本原因，而这些掩饰伪装便是英美垄断资本家的一切打算所依靠的东西。为了掩饰，他们便依恃对联合国宪章明显的歪曲，依恃对事实的横暴伪造，例如企图引用宪章第五十五条——虽然谁都可以很容易晓得，宪章第五十五条并不曾规定有对独立国家的内政作任何干涉的权利。苏联代表已援引了旧金山会议纪录择要以证明引用宪章五十五条之完全无稽。如所周知，在制订宪章五十五条的时候，曾对这一问题予以特别考虑，并在旧金山作出如下决定：“宪章第九章（也包括第五十五条在内）不得解释为授组织（指联合国组织——编者）以干涉会员国内政之权。尤有进者，一九四五年六月二十五，出席旧金山会议的美国代表团向美总统提出的报告称：会议上有一种意见说，澳大利亚建议中要求各国在国际组织之外采取措施一点，超越了国际组织宪章的范围，且可能甚至由于把政府和私人间关系的一定的概念强加于会员国身上而构成对会员国国内管辖权的侵犯行为。
    最后，所通过的义务便是旨在排除此种解释的可能性。这义务责成各个国家以共同的和分别的措施与联合国合作，以达成联合国底经济和社会的目的，而不违犯各国按照自己的能力，以其自己的方法，和依从其自己的政治与经济机构及程序，进行其国家事务的权利。
    按照这一点，该报告指出宪章给经济、社会和有关各方面空前规模的国际合作，打开了道路。同时，宪章保护各国按照自己的方式生活和免于无论如何都是不正当的干涉的权利。
    最后，有一些问题是在政治上和在法律上一样的重要的。这些问题特别受到美国和英国代表的相当大的注意。这些问题是与建设中要求国际法庭提供咨询性意见的那一部分直接关连着的。
    第一个问题是关于所谓争议的存在。美国和英国的代表顽固地坚持说：在我们所谈到的情况中有所谓某种争议。但是问题来了——在他们谈到争议的时候，他们想到些什么？他们究竟想到什么样的争议？那一个国家与那一个国家间的争议？假如我们引用和约中的有关的条文，即对罗和约第三十七条，对保和约第三十五条，对匈和约第三十九条，无疑地和约就已预见到双方间可能发生的争议（一方面是罗马尼亚、保加利亚或匈牙利，而另一方——美、英、苏三国），按照和约，美、英、苏三国在与所有上述国家在有关这些和约之履行和解释的一切问题上发生关系时，是代表着同盟国及其协同国的。
    和约因而预见到双方间事实上可能发生争议时的这种情况。这些戒条的正确性，也被上述条款中的规定所着重指出，这些规定确定了在何种情况下，美、英、苏三国应该协议行动。因此，就不可能有这样的情况，即不是由上述的三国全体一致地，而是由其中的一国对罗马尼亚、匈牙利或保加利亚提出要求。因此，在可能的争议中、如象对保、匈、罗和约关于履行和解释这些条约所预见的，争执之点可能是上述国家的政府（一方）与三大国（一方）之间所发生的分歧。这样，这规则便排斥了这三个国家中的一国、甚或两国单独行动的可能性，因为在这种场合中，便不会有三国协同的行动。然而，恰恰就是在这种场合中，没有这种协议，因为苏联在保、匈、罗对和约之履行与解释上，并没有看见什么违法之处，而苏联之所以没有发见，是因为这些违法之处根本不存在。恰恰相反，保、匈、罗三国政府正很诚实敏捷地履行和约，并且在履行和约上，不容许有任何偏差。目前既然是这样的情形，那就没有任何根据去说和约所规定的那些方面之间有什么争议。因此，也就没有任何理由向国际法庭征求关于争议存在问题的咨询性意见，这问题是由对保和约第三十六条、和对匈和约第四十条与对罗约第三十八条中有所规定的。
    这么一来，议案上关于保、匈、罗三国政府有为争议而指派其代表出席委员会之责任的第二个问题，便应认为已经被剔除了。
    从上面看来，对保和约第三十六条、对罗和约第三十八条与对匈和约第四十条为解决争议而规定的程序，也是完全不适用于这种场合的，这应该是了如指掌的了。我再重复一句：这些条款所规定的程序是为了以美、英、苏作一方，而保、匈、罗作对方的那些争议的。如前所言，现在却不是这种情形，因为应由三国组成的一方只包括了两国——美国与英国。而第三个国家，却是断然反对在所谓违反和约一事上针对保、匈、罗三国而提出任何要求的苏联。
    那么，把第三个问题，即和约相应条款所规定的由秘书长指派调人的权利问题，也提交国际法庭一事，也是毫无根据的。从这些条款的原文可以看见：这些情形所指的，并不是一方面之内单独的国家，而是构成这一方面的三个国家全体。假如这一方面少了这三个国家——美、英、苏——中的一国，那么，在此一词的法律意义上说来，就不成其为一方面了，并且利用多种繁琐的解释与法学上的诡辩来把三国一方转变成只有两国的一方的种种企图，也显然歪曲了和约上述的精神与文字。
    从这里也就得出一个直接的结论，即建议提交国际法庭的第四个问题完全破产了。这便是委员会即使在最后计算起来非由三位委员（即双方的代表与调人）而是由一方的代表——两位委员及调人组成时，是否也有资格解决争议的问题。
    提出这种问题这件事本身，便是绝对不能容许的，因为这样我们就显然在言辞上冒了险，而有害于法律逻辑和常识。因此，并非偶然，特别委员会中法国代表鉴于其显然的违背法理和政治上的非常无知，而拒绝支持第三和第四问题。但我必须告诉法国代表——假如你拒斥第三和第四问题，那么照逻辑，你就必须拒斥第一和第二问题，因为第一和第二问题是第四和第三问题的基础，而第三和第四问题只是完成全部事体而已。我们已经向政治委员会指明，把这种类型的问题提交国际法庭，对国际法庭和联大两者都是堕落的事，似乎不用为此举出进一步的证明了。必须促起大会对这一点的注意，并且必须设法使联大避免此种只能使它堕落的步骤。但是从本质上说，强加于大会之上的，所谓保、匈、罗三国政府侵害人权和基本自由问题的讨论一事本身，就使大会堕落。从上述一切看来，应该是明白的了：对三个人民民主国家的无理的诽谤运动，与政治委员会多数方面提交大会考虑的议案一样，遵循着可疑的目的。
    苏联代表团反对这一议案，坚决主张拒决这一议案，因为通过此种决议，便会鼓励侵害独立民主国家底主权的诽谤者和伪造者。这是不可容许的。
