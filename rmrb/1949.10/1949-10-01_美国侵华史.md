　　A History of American Aggression Against China
　　IV. Exclusive Control of China (Continued XXVI)
    On February 9 of the same year, the U.S. State Department issued an anti-Soviet note to the Chiang government, prompting Chiang Kai-shek to launch a large-scale anti-Soviet, anti-communist, and anti-democratic movement, attempting to strike a blow to the CCP. On February 25, Marshall participated in formulating a military reorganization plan stipulating that the people's armed forces could not move their defensive positions. In early March, the U.S. helped Chiang Kai-shek transport three armies to the Northeast, but this force was insufficient for him to launch a major offensive immediately. On March 25, Marshall presided over the establishment of the Northeast Truce Agreement to alleviate the unfavorable situation for Chiang Kai-shek. In April, the U.S. Navy in China transported three more of Chiang's armies to the Northeast. By this time, Chiang Kai-shek's deployments were nearly complete, and Marshall left China to fly back to Washington, allowing Chiang Kai-shek to launch an offensive without restraint. After Marshall's return to China, he not only remained aloof from the war but also proposed to transport two more armies to Qinhuangdao and Qingdao to "take over defense duties to allow the U.S. Marines to withdraw." The CCP protested, but the U.S. ignored the protest and transported three more armies, while the U.S. Marines naturally continued to stay there to help with the war. In May, as the war developed to Sipingjie and Changchun, the U.S. Navy continued to help Chiang Kai-shek transport troops to the Northeast, while expressing to the CCP that it could not "mediate" unless Changchun was evacuated. When the CCP was willing to exchange the withdrawal from Changchun for a truce in the Northeast, Marshall again stated that he had no power to "mediate." By this time, Chiang Kai-shek had completely torn up the Northeast Truce Agreement, and Marshall did not insist on a truce in the Northeast, but expressed his willingness to insist on a truce inside the pass, as it was still necessary to allow time for Chiang Kai-shek to make deployments there. On June 6, Chiang Kai-shek ordered a fifteen-day truce, during which Marshall presided over the so-called "armistice negotiations." This was partly forced and partly a signal that Chiang Kai-shek was preparing for a nationwide civil war. On June 14, the U.S. State Department publicly proposed a military aid bill to Chiang Kai-shek, submitting it to Congress for "deliberation," directly provoking a solemn protest from the Chinese people, represented by Chairman Mao of the CCP. At the same time, the U.S. government began to approve a secret U.S.-Chiang military agreement, under which the U.S. would supply Chiang Kai-shek with over a thousand aircraft, over seven thousand artillery pieces, and other large quantities of military supplies. By June 17, the U.S. had made two demands on the CCP: one was that Chiang Kai-shek, through Marshall, demanded not only almost all nine provinces outside the pass but also the Suwan Border Region, Rehe and Chahar provinces, the Longhai and Jinpu railways, and the ports of Weihaiwei and Yantai; the other was that Marshall, at Chiang Kai-shek's instigation, "suggested" that Marshall have "final decision-making power" over the China issue (later, the Kuomintang interpreted it as "arbitration power" or "final adjudication power," but the meaning was the same). This indicated that the large-scale offensive inside the pass, arranged by the U.S. for Chiang Kai-shek, had reached its time. On June 28, the U.S. government formally approved the secret U.S.-Chiang military agreement, and in early July, Chiang Kai-shek's large-scale civil war, besieging the Central Plains and Suwan liberated areas, broke out. At this time, Marshall did not insist on a truce inside the pass either. Before Marshall's arrival, Chiang Kai-shek's total force for fighting the civil war was one million, accounting for about 45% of his total force. By this time, Chiang Kai-shek's force had increased to nearly two million, accounting for about 85% of his total force. Before Marshall's arrival, the number of Chiang's troops equipped with U.S. weapons was thirty-nine divisions, but now it was fifty divisions, all of which were used on the front lines. In addition, there was the air force formed by U.S. aircraft and the navy composed of U.S. warships. This was the only result of Marshall's arrival in China for "mediation."
    After that, when Chiang Kai-shek launched a large-scale siege of the Central Plains Liberated Area, Marshall expressed no opinion whatsoever. But when the Central Plains Liberation Army charged into the Xiangyang and Fancheng area, possibly entering Sichuan and Shaanxi, Marshall hurriedly sent an executive group to stop them. As a Shanghai magazine said: "If a CCP base is cut off, Marshall will not come forward to speak, but if it takes too much time to cut off this base, or if it causes other problems, or if the Kuomintang suffers instead, then Marshall will immediately 'mediate'."
    Until August 1946, the American aggressors' attempt to eliminate the People's Army by means of "mediation" not only failed to materialize but also exposed their true colors to the Chinese people. The great deceiver of American imperialism, Marshall, and another great deceiver, Stuart, then issued a joint statement:
    "The war is expanding, threatening to engulf the whole country... Both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party are willing to end the war, but there are still some issues that need to be resolved, and no agreement has been reached. It seems impossible for both sides to reach a resolution on various issues..."

　　美国侵华史
　　四　独占中国（续二十六）
    同年二月九日，美国国务院对蒋政府发出一个反苏照会，由蒋介石发动一大规模反苏、反共、反民主运动，企图以此给中共一个打击，同月二十五日马歇尔参加制订整军方案，规定人民武装不得移动防地。三月初，美国帮助蒋介石运三个军到东北，但这个力量很不够，使他不能马上大打，同月二十五日马歇尔即主持成立东北停战协定，把对蒋介石不利的局势和缓一下。四月间美驻华海军又把蒋军三个军运到东北，这时蒋介石的部署已经差不多了，马歇尔便离开中国飞回了华盛顿，让蒋介石好放手进攻。马歇尔再度来华后，不仅对战争袖手旁观，且提出要再运两个军到秦皇岛青岛去“接替防务，以便美海军陆战队撤退”，中共抗议，美国不理，又运去了三个军，而美国陆战队当然还继续留在那里帮战争的大忙。五月间，战事发展至四平街与长春，美国海军继续帮蒋介石运兵东北，向中共则表示：不撤出长春便不能“调处”及中共愿换取东北停战从长春退出，马歇尔又表示没有力量“调停”了。这时蒋介石已完全撕毁东北停战协议，马歇尔也并不坚持东北停战，但对关内停战表示还愿意坚持，因为还须留出时间让蒋介石好在关内布置。六月六日蒋介石下令停战十五天，由马歇尔主持所谓“休战谈判”，一方面是被迫，一方面也是蒋介石正布置全国性内战的信号。同月十四日，美国国务院公开提出一个军事援蒋法案，交国会“审议”，直接引起中国人民方面以中共毛主席声明为代表的严正抗议，同时，美政府又着手批准一个美蒋秘密军事协定，由美国供给蒋介石飞机一千余架，各种炮七千余门及其他大批军火，至六月十七日美国就向中共提出两个要求，一个是形式上蒋介石经过马歇尔提出：不仅关外要几乎全部九省，并且要关内苏皖边区，热察两省，陇海，津浦两路，威海卫烟台两港。一个是实际上马歇尔授意蒋介石提出；“建议”马歇尔对中国问题有“最后决定权”（后来国民党解释为“仲裁权”或“公断权”，但意义相同）。这表示美国替蒋介石布置的关内大打已到了时候了。六月二十八日美政府对美蒋军事秘约正式批准，七月初蒋介石围攻中原与苏皖两解放区的内战便更大规模爆发。这时马歇尔对关内停战也不坚持了。在马歇尔未来以前，蒋介石打内战的全部兵力是一百万人，约占其总兵力百分之四十五。这时蒋介石的兵力增加到近两百万人，约占其总兵力的百分之八十五。马歇尔未来以前，用美械装备的蒋军是三十九个师，这时为五十个师，且全部用在前线。此外还有美机编成的空军，美舰组成的海军，这就是马歇尔来华“调处”的唯一结果。
    此后，当蒋介石大举围攻中原解放区时，马歇尔不表示丝毫意见，但当中原解放军冲到襄阳樊城一带，可能入川入陕的时候，马歇尔又赶忙派执行小组来阻止了，正如上海一个杂志所说：“割掉一块中共基地，马歇尔不会出面说话，但倘若因割这块基地而花了太多的时间，或会引起别的问题，或会叫国民党反而吃亏了，那马歇尔是立刻便要‘调停’的”。
    直至一九四六年八月间，美国侵略者想用“调处”方式来消灭人民军队，不仅一点没有实现，自己的马脚反因此在中国人民面前暴露无遗，美帝国主义的大骗子马歇尔和另一个大骗子司徒雷登这时发表一个联合声明：
    “战争日益扩大，有席卷全国………的威胁，国共两方都愿终止战争，但仍有若干立须解决的问题，尚未获得任何协议，对于各项问题，双方似已不可能获得解决………”
