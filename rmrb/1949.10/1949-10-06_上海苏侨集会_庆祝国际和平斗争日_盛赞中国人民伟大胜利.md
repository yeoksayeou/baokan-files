Tsibunovsky stated: "Today is the International Day of Struggle for Peace, and at the same time, the People's Government headed by the Chinese Communist Party led by Chairman Mao Zedong has been established. The combination of these two is a symbol of peace." Tsibunovsky continued: "The victory of the Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party is a new warning to the warmongers, and at the same time, it is a new guarantee for lasting peace." Youth representatives, women representatives, engineers, and literary, artistic, and journalistic workers from the presidium also gave speeches, denouncing the imperialists' war conspiracies to deliberately invade others.
