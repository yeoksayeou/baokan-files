　　Excerpts from Speeches by He Xiangning and Others at the Inaugural Meeting of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association

　　The following are excerpts from the speeches of He Xiangning, Zhang Lan, Wu Yuzhang, Shao Lizi, Saifuddin, and others at the inaugural meeting of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association.

　　In her speech, He Xiangning said with deep feeling and excitement: "The genuine friendship between China and the Soviet Union, which Chinese patriots have strived for with blood and sacrifice for thirty-two years, can be greatly developed today. This truly makes me feel boundless joy and excitement." He Xiangning earnestly said, "We, the older generation, sincerely hope that our younger generation will not waste this time. The Soviet Union is the teacher, and our school is the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. We must use our school to ask the teacher to teach us well, and the students must study diligently. We believe that the teacher will definitely teach us wholeheartedly because thirty-two years of experience have proven that our teacher is the least selfish and the most willing to teach students wholeheartedly."

　　In his speech, Zhang Lan said: "The friendly feelings between the people of China and the Soviet Union are established on the basis of 'like-mindedness.' Like-minded friends are not casual acquaintances. Our two peoples are not just friendly for the sake of friendship, but are working hand in hand to ensure that all good people in the world can enjoy peace, democracy, and progressive happiness."

　　In his speech, Wu Yuzhang strongly condemned the Kuomintang bandit gang's representatives for their rabid attacks on the Soviet Union at the United Nations General Assembly. He said: A few days ago, Chiang Tingfu, the little running dog of American imperialism, clamored at the United Nations General Assembly to "accuse" the Soviet Union, learning the crimes of fascist bandits in fabricating and distorting history. These big and small Chiangs who are learning from fascist bandits will eventually perish like Goebbels, the deceptive propagandist of German fascism. This is destined by history.

　　In his speech, Shao Lizi said: "It is not only because the Soviet Union and China are neighboring countries connected by borders that we should be friendly with the Soviet Union, but also because the Soviet Union is truly the most benevolent 'benevolent person' in the world, so we should be even more friendly with the Soviet Union."

　　Saifuddin said: Between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union, a friendship has been established that no reactionary force can destroy. This friendship is a great blow to the world's reactionary aggressive bloc headed by American and British imperialists. Although there are many difficulties on the road to progress in New China, we will undoubtedly achieve victory because we have a forever reliable friend—the Soviet people.

　　中苏友好协会成立大会上
    何香凝等演说词摘要
    【新华社北京五日电】何香凝、张澜、吴玉章、邵力子、赛福鼎等在中苏友好协会总会成立大会上的演说词摘要如下：
    何香凝在讲演中沉痛而兴奋地说：“三十二年来中国的仁人志士流血牺牲所努力争取的中苏真正友好，今天能够发扬光大，这真使我感到无上的愉快和兴奋。”何香凝恳切地说：“我们这年纪老了的一代，很希望看到我们的年青的一代不要辜负这光阴。苏联是老师，我们的学校就是中苏友好协会，我们要利用我们的学校，好好请老师来教我们，学生要用心学。我们相信，老师一定很用心教的。因为三十二年的经验证明，我们的老师是最不自私，也是最肯用心教学生的。”
    张澜在讲演中说：“中苏两国人民的友好情谊，是在‘志同道合’的基础上建立起来的。志同道合的朋友，不是泛泛之交。我们两国人民不只是为友好而友好，而是为了使世界上一切善良人类都能得到和平、民主、进步的幸福而携手合作。”
    吴玉章在讲演中痛斥了国民党匪帮的代表在联合国大会上对苏联的狂吠，他说：前几天美帝国主义走狗的小走狗蒋廷黻在联合国大会上叫嚣什么“控诉”苏联，学习着法西斯匪徒伪造历史、曲解历史的罪行。这些学习法西斯匪徒的大蒋小蒋，终将和德国法西斯的欺骗宣传家戈培尔一样归于灭亡，这是历史注定了的。
    邵力子在讲演中说：“不只是因为苏联和中国是疆界连接的邻邦，所以要和苏联亲善，更因为苏联实在是世界上最仁的‘仁者’，所以更要和苏联亲善。”
    赛福鼎说：在中苏两国人民中间，已建立起任何反动势力所不可破坏的友谊，这个友谊，是对美英帝国主义者为首的世界反动侵略集团的一个很大的打击。在新中国前进路程上虽有许多困难，但是我们毫无疑问地要获得胜利，因为我们有了永远可靠的朋友——苏联人民。
