　　Shaw on the Trial of American Communist Leaders
    Wang Jin
    Last October, the American Communist Party's newspaper, the "Daily Worker," cabled the famous British playwright George Bernard Shaw, requesting his comments on the reactionary government's arrest and prosecution of twelve American Communist leaders. We all know that Shaw is a humorous writer in his nineties, and one of the founders of the Fabian Socialist Society. Although some of his views are not entirely correct, politically he supports the British Communist Party, has always praised the Soviet Union, and called Stalin the greatest man in the world. The "Daily Worker" sent him a telegram on October 20th of last year, and the next day he replied with a scathing denunciation of the American government's reactionary move. He satirized the American courts, saying, "If they had the power, they would also accuse St. Peter of rebellion and murder." Shaw's short commentary is titled "The Persecution of the Twelve Apostles." Because the trial of the American Communist Party leaders is not only about a political party, but an attack by the American reactionary government on the democratic rights of all the people, it has aroused the anger and protest of democrats of various political beliefs. The protest of a world-renowned writer who is nearing a century of life has an undeniable force. The translation is as follows:
    "Among the fraudulent acts carried out in democratic countries today, none is as naive and foolish as that of the American legislative authorities, and nothing else proves so fully the failure of history lessons taught in its schools.
    In the United States today, there is no statistic for how many citizens believe in communism because of reading the Communist Manifesto, the books of Marx and Engels, and the works of the Hammonds and Upton Sinclair; but it will not be less than one percent of the 130 million population.
    The world's level of knowledge is still very low, so we estimate that there are about 1.25 million Marxists in the United States. In order to prohibit the popularity of communism, the American government arrested twelve people, accusing them of intending to incite the overthrow of the government by force, which is exactly what Washington and Jefferson did to establish the United States of America.
    The creator of Christianity was a communist. He had eleven loyal apostles, and the leader killed a couple because they did not put their money in public and were unwilling to share it. But the American legislators, although pretending to be Christians on the surface, do not even read the Bible, let alone the works of Karl Marx. If they had the power, they would also accuse St. Peter of rebellion and murder.
    "I do not want to add any more criticism. The matter itself is an explanation."
    The Hammonds mentioned in Shaw's article are J.L. Hammond and Barbara Hammond, who are famous researchers of the history of the British labor movement.

### 萧伯纳评美共领袖的受审

　　美共领袖的受审
    王进
    去年十月美共机关报“工人日报”曾电请英国名戏剧家萧伯纳就美共领袖十二人受到反动政府的逮捕起诉事，加以评论。我们都知道萧伯纳是以幽默闻名的年逾九十的老作家，费边社会主义协会的创办人之一。虽则他的某些观点不完全是正确的，但在政治上他支持英国共产党，一向赞扬苏联，称斯大林为世界上最伟大的人。“工人日报”于去年十月二十日打电报给他，他在第二天就复电痛斥美国政府的这一反动举措，他讽刺美国法院说，“如果他们力量够得到，他们也会控诉圣彼得以叛乱和谋杀罪的。”萧伯纳的短评题目叫“十二使徒的受害”。由于美国共产党领袖的受审不仅是有关一个政党的事，而是美国反动政府向全体人民的民主权利的进攻，因此它引起了各种政治信仰的民主分子的愤怒与抗议，作为一个生命将及一世纪的世界文豪的抗议，是具有不可忽视的力量的。兹译出如下：
    “在今天民主国家内进行的欺诈行为中，再也没有比美国立法当局那么幼稚愚蠢了，也再也没有别的事这样充分证明了它的学校中讲授历史课的失败了。
    在今天的美国，由于读共产党宣言，读马克思和恩格斯的书籍，以及读哈蒙特夫妇和霭普登·辛克莱的著作，而信仰共产主义的公民，共有多少，没有统计过；但不会少于一亿三千万人口的百分之一。
    这个世界的知识程度依旧很低，所以我们估计美国的马克思主义者约一百二十五万人。为了禁止共产主义的流行，美国政府逮捕了十二个人，控诉他们意图教唆以武力推翻政府，而这刚好是华盛顿和杰弗逊当年所做的事，因此才能建立美利坚合众国。
    基督教的创造者是个共产主义者，他有十一个尽忠的使徒，为首的一个曾把一对夫妇打死，为了他们不把自己的钱放在公众的一起，不肯分掉。但是美国的立法者们，表面上虽则装做基督徒，却连圣经也不念，更不要说卡尔·马克思的著作了。如果他们力量够得到，他们也会控诉圣彼得以叛乱和谋杀罪的。
    “我不欲再加批评。这件事本身就是一个说明。”
    萧氏文中所提到的哈蒙特夫妇是Ｊ·Ｌ·哈蒙特，和巴巴拉·哈蒙特，他们是英国劳工运动史的著名研究者。
