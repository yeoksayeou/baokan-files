Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Chinese compatriots in Ulaanbaatar (Kulun), the capital of the Mongolian People's Republic, held a celebration meeting for the founding of the People's Republic of China and sent a telegram to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu expressing their congratulations. The telegram stated: We, the Chinese nationals residing and working in Ulaanbaatar (Kulun), the capital of the Mongolian People's Republic, held a meeting to celebrate the founding of the People's Republic of China, welcoming with immense joy the long-awaited liberation of the Chinese working people, achieved through the crushing of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries, and the Chinese People's Democratic Government headed by the leader of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong. We, the workers residing in the Mongolian People's Republic, enjoy a free and happy life. The people of the Mongolian Republic, under the leadership of Marshal Choibalsan and with the fraternal help of the great Soviet Union, have obtained a happy life and established the unity of all nationalities within its borders. We Chinese workers working in the economic, cultural, and social sectors of the Mongolian People's Republic have full guarantees for our living and cultural conditions. Many of us have achieved brilliant results in our work, for which many Chinese workers have been awarded orders, medals, and honorary titles of the Mongolian People's Republic.

    We are infinitely excited about the victorious conclusion of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the news of the establishment of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China on October 1. The long-held expectations and wishes of the Chinese people have finally been realized. The Chinese people have finally been liberated from the oppression of the Kuomintang reactionaries and American imperialism, and have established a free and independent people's democratic country. This is an unprecedented great change in history and the greatest victory of the Chinese people. This is the result of the heroic Chinese Communist Party and its chairman Mao Zedong's wise leadership and the self-sacrificing struggle of the Chinese People's Liberation Army headed by Commander-in-Chief Zhu De.

    We wholeheartedly offer our warm congratulations to you and, through you, to all the Chinese people for this great historic victory.

    Long live the People's Republic of China!
    Long live the heroic Chinese Communist Party and our beloved leader Chairman Mao!
    Long live the great Stalin, the beloved leader of the working people of the world!
