Movies are Excellent Educational Tools

	The founding of the People's Republic of China has ushered in a new era in Chinese history. The current tasks are, on the one hand, to carry the revolutionary war through to the end, and on the other hand, to strive for all construction work, restore the wounds of war, organize productive forces, and rapidly industrialize China.

	In both of these tasks, we should do our best to learn from the Soviet Union and emulate the Soviet Union in all aspects of national defense, economic construction, and cultural construction.

	The Soviet Union has been established for thirty-two years, and socialist construction is nearing completion. There are countless valuable experiences worth absorbing. There are many ways to absorb them, but perhaps the most convenient way is through movies.

	You don't necessarily have to understand Russian, nor do you need to go to the Soviet Union yourself. Just sit quietly for three or two hours, and the construction work of the Soviet Union in all aspects, which has been carefully selected or organized as a standard model, will be presented before your eyes, providing you with concrete teachings from the source.

	Movies are excellent educational tools. In the past, the reactionaries tried their best to restrict and block Soviet films. Today, we can accept Soviet films as much as possible without any obstacles. Accept them as much as possible, you can rest assured that Soviet films will not have any harmful toxins.

	We should, of course, accept educational films as much as possible, and we should also accept ordinary feature films as much as possible. Accepting healthy films and defeating the poisonous things of American and British imperialism can be said to be an important task of the current cultural and educational work. We should be eager to disinfect and make the spirit of nation-building healthy.

	Anglo-American formalism has anesthetized many people. Not only the general public has been anesthetized, but also many experts have been deeply anesthetized. Experts generally have the opinion that British and American films have a certain advantage in terms of technology, while Soviet films have good content, but the technology is inevitably rough. This view is actually a symptom of being poisoned.

	Content and form are originally inseparable things. Unhealthy content loves to painstakingly carve on the form and fall into formalism. This proves its unhealthiness. Healthy content naturally has its healthy beauty. May I ask: the rouge on the face of anemic people or the blush on the cheeks of patients with lung disease, if your consciousness is sound, can you think it is truly beautiful?

	It is time for the experts to change their minds as well. Let us strive to learn the healthy consciousness and technology of the Soviet Union, and establish a new Chinese form that is national, popular, and scientific.

　　电影是很好的教育工具
    中华人民共和国的成立，使中国的历史开辟了一个新时代。当前的任务，一方面应该将革命战争进行到底，另一方面应该努力一切的建设工作，恢复战争的创伤，组织生产的力量，使中国迅速工业化。
    在这双方面的工作中，我们都应该尽力学习苏联，向苏联的国防建设，经济建设，文化建设等各方面看齐。
    苏联建国已经有了三十二年的历史，社会主义的建设已经快达到完成的阶段。有无数宝贵的经验是值得我们吸收的。吸收的方法很多，但通过电影，恐怕是最方便的一个法门吧。
    不必一定要懂俄文，更不必要你亲自到苏联去，只消你静静地坐三两个钟头，苏联各方面的建设工作，而且是经过精选或组织的标准典型，便呈显在你的眼前，源源本本地给予你具体的示教。
    电影是很好的教育工具，以前反动派尽力地限制和封锁苏联的影片，今天我们可以毫无阻碍地尽量接受苏联的影片了。尽量接受吧，可以放心，苏联的影片是不会有什么害人的毒素的。
    教育片子，我们固然应当尽量的接受，就是普通的故事片子也应当尽量的接受。接受健康的影片，打倒美英帝国主义的富有毒素的东西，可以说是目前文教工作的一件重要的事务。我们应该急于消毒，把建国的精神健康起来。
    英美式的形式主义是麻醉了不少人的，不仅一般人受了麻醉，就是不少的专家所受的麻醉也实在很深。专家们大体上有这样的意见，以为英美的影片在技术方面是有一日之长的，苏联的影片内容好，而技术则不免粗糙。这种见解其实就是中了毒的现象。
    内容和形式本来是分不开来的东西，内容不健康的便爱在形式上苦心雕琢，堕入形式主义。这正证明其不健康。健康的内容便自有它的健康的美。请问：贫血者脸上的胭脂或肺病患者颊上的晕红，假如你的意识健全，你能以为它真正是美吗？
    专家们的脑筋也是应该改换的时候了。尽量学习苏联的健康的意识和技术，建立出民族的、大众的、科学的中国新形式吧。
