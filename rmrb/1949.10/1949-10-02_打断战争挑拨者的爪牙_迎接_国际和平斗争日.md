　　Break the Claws of the Warmongers
    ——Welcoming the "International Day of Struggle for Peace"
    The "International Day of Struggle for Peace," announced by the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace, has arrived. This is a day of great battle demonstrations by the people of the world against new wars, a day of great peace marches by the people of the world against the instigators of new wars. Vast numbers of people in seventy-two countries spread across five continents are everywhere carrying out grand rallies, parades, peace votes, and other activities to express their will, determination, and great strength in united struggle to defend peace.
    Despite the fact that a small handful of war adventurers, headed by US imperialism, are engaging in Hitler-style militarism amid the flashing of swords and shadows of sabers, carrying out actual preparations for war; on the other hand, they are engaging in hysterical propaganda filled with intimidation and roaring to prepare public opinion for launching a reactionary war of aggression. However, all of this has not and cannot possibly frighten or deceive the peace-loving people of the world. The movement against war and in defense of peace is becoming wider and more universal day by day, and is becoming more organized and broadly mass-based day by day.
    In order to safeguard world peace and security, Stalin, the great leader of mankind fighting for peace, twice declared in January this year the Soviet Union's consistent policy of peace, expressing the Soviet Union's willingness to discuss disputes between the two countries with the United States, and welcoming Truman to the Soviet Union, Poland, and Czechoslovakia for discussions. Stalin's statement in defense of peace won the warm support of the vast people of the world, ignited the hopes and confidence of progressive mankind in ensuring world peace, and the voice demanding peace has become increasingly loud. Subsequently, the leaders of the French and Italian Communist Parties, Thorez and Togliatti, issued statements in February, announcing that if an anti-Soviet war breaks out, the working class and people of France and Italy will stand on the side of the Soviet Union and fight alongside the Soviet army against the imperialists. These statements created a great mobilization of the working class and progressive people in the capitalist world to defend peace, and the Communist Parties in Europe and the United States have risen to respond to the solemn call of Thorez and Togliatti. The movement to defend peace has been greatly developed in capitalist countries, especially in France and Italy. With the convocation of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace from April 20th to 25th, and the establishment of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace, the peace forces of seventy-two countries in the world were completely organized. Since then, under the unified leadership of this central organization, the world peace movement has unfolded in a more organized, broader, and deeper manner. It has been less than half a year since the closing of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace. Peace branches have been established in the Soviet Union, the United States, Italy, Britain, Canada, Germany, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Romania, Hungary, Finland, Greece, and many other countries. The Chinese peace branch will also be officially established on October 2nd. The call of "No War Allowed" resounds throughout every corner of the world. More and more people from all over the world, including the vast people in the Americas who are tightly controlled by US imperialism, are joining the ranks of peace. Now, the unprecedentedly large-scale movement to defend world peace launched by the "International Day of Struggle for Peace" marks that the people's movement against new wars has reached a new climax, and the majority of people in all countries have been generally mobilized to carry out a worldwide struggle for peace and against the danger of new wars.
    The international reactionaries, headed by the United States, are continuing to intensify their war preparation policies. The "North Atlantic Treaty," signed in March as a tool of aggressive war, is being accelerated. The "Military Aid Foreign Plan," which supplements this aggressive treaty, is being finalized in the US Congress. The conspiracy of the American reactionaries to foster the revival of German and Japanese fascism to serve as the main accomplices in their aggressive war has become even more intensified. The puppet government of West Germany, which split the unification of Germany, has made its debut. The conspiracy of "no declaration of peace" with Japan is being carried out openly. The ugly drama of the "Pacific Alliance" against the people of the East is also being directed. All this proves that the danger of war does exist.
    However, this danger is completely surmountable. Because the strength of the world democratic peace camp, headed by the Soviet Union, is unprecedentedly strong and has greatly surpassed the strength of the aggressive camp, headed by the United States. The national strength of the Soviet Union is being further enhanced. The new democratic countries in Eastern Europe are continuing to consolidate and grow stronger because the traitorous conspiracies of spies such as Rajk have been extinguished. The surging tide of the peace movement all over the world, the victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War, the establishment of the People's Republic of China, and the active participation of China's 475 million people in the struggle for peace have further strengthened and consolidated the world democratic peace camp. At the same time, the strength of the aggressive camp, headed by US imperialism, is rolling downhill. First, imperialist countries are facing increasingly serious economic difficulties and crises; second, the imperialist camp, headed by the United States, is not only in an extremely isolated position due to the serious opposition of the people of the world, but also because of the repeated setbacks and failures of its foreign aggressive policy, and the deepening economic crisis, its internal contradictions must and have become increasingly sharp, thus further weakening its strength. Third, American war instigators have always regarded atomic weapons as a magic weapon for instigating aggressive wars and extortion, but this magic weapon has long been ineffective. The recent TASS statement that the Soviet Union has long possessed atomic weapons but the Soviet Union still insists on destroying all atomic weapons, demonstrates the greater strength of the world democratic peace camp, giving atomic militarists a heavy blow and causing panic among US imperialism and its lackeys.
    The experience of the victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War proves that the head of the aggressive camp, US imperialism, is only a paper tiger. This paper tiger has been completely exposed by the revolutionary people of the Soviet Union, China, and other countries, and has been poked all over with wounds. Therefore, as long as peace-loving people in all countries of the world continue to work hard, further strengthen the struggle for peace, implement the spirit of the "International Day of Struggle for Peace" in future daily and lasting struggles, strengthen lasting friendship with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, and consolidate the forces of peace and democracy, then the conspiracies of the new war instigators will surely be smashed to pieces. The victory of peace belongs to the people of the world.

### 打断战争挑拨者的爪牙——迎接“国际和平斗争日”

　　打断战争挑拨者的爪牙
    ——迎接“国际和平斗争日”
    世界拥护和平大会常设委员会宣布的“国际和平斗争日”已经到来，这是世界人民反对新战争的战斗大示威的日子，是世界人民向新战争挑拨者举行和平大进军的日子，在散布于五大洲的七十二个国家中的广大人民，正在到处进行着盛大的集会、游行、和平投票等等活动，以表示它们为保卫和平而团结斗争的意志、决心和伟力。
    尽管以美国帝国主义为首的一小撮战争冒险家，它们一面在刀光剑影中实行希特勒式的黩武主义，进行着战争的实际准备；一面则从事充满恐吓和咆哮、歇斯底里的宣传，来为发动反动侵略战争作舆论准备。但是，所有这一切并没有也决不可能吓唬或欺骗住世界爱好和平的人民的。反对战争和保卫和平的运动，是一天比一天更加广泛和普遍了，是一天比一天更加带有组织性和广大的群众性了。
    为了维护世界和平与安全，为和平而奋斗的人类伟大的领袖斯大林，曾于今年一月两次宣示苏联一贯的和平政策，表示苏联愿与美国商谈两国间的争端，并欢迎杜鲁门到苏联、波兰和捷克去商谈。斯大林这个卫护和平的声明，博得了世界广大人民的热烈拥护，燃起了进步人类对确保世界和平的热望和信心，要求和平的声音日益响亮起来。接着，法、意两国共产党领袖多列士和托格里亚蒂，于二月先后发表声明，宣布如果反苏战争爆发，法意两国工人阶级和人民将站在苏联方面与苏军并肩作战反对帝国主义者。这些声明造成了资本主义世界工人阶级和进步人民保卫和平的大动员，欧美等国的共产党都纷起响应多列士和托格里亚蒂的庄严号召。保卫和平的运动在资本主义各国特别是法意等国得到了极大的发展。到四月二十日——二十五日世界拥护和平大会的召开，以及世界拥护和平大会常设委员会的建立，使世界七十二国的和平力量完全组织起来。从此，世界和平运动在这一中心组织的统一领导下，更有组织、更广泛而深入地展开了。世界拥护和平大会闭幕以来还不到半年，苏、美、意、英、加、德、捷、波、罗、匈、芬、希以及其他许多国家，都已成立了和平分会，中国的和平分会也定于十月二日正式成立。“不许战争”的呼声响遍世界各个角落。全世界各国，包括为美帝国主义紧紧控制的美洲大陆各国内的广大人民，愈来愈多地参加到和平行列中来了。现在，由“国际和平斗争日”所展开的空前规模的保卫世界和平的运动，标志着世界人民反对新战争的人民运动已经到达一个新高潮，各国大多数人民已经总动员起来，为和平、为反对新战争危险而进行世界范围的斗争了。
    以美国为首的国际反动派，仍在继续加紧推行其战争准备政策。今年三月签订的作为侵略战争工具的“北大西洋公约”，正在加紧实施中。作为这一侵略公约的补充的“军事援外计划”，正在美国国会完成立法手续。美国反动派扶植德日法西斯复活以充当其侵略战争主要帮手的阴谋活动，已更变本加厉，分裂德国统一的西德傀儡政府已经粉墨登场，对日“不宣而和”的阴谋正公开进行，反对东方人民的“太平洋联盟”的丑剧也在继续导演中。这一切证明：战争的危险确是存在着。
    但是这种危险是完全可以克服的。因为以苏联为首的世界民主和平阵营的力量已空前强大，并已大大超过了以美国为首的侵略阵营的力量。苏联国力正在进一步提高，东欧新民主各国正因拉伊克等奸细叛国阴谋被扑灭而继续巩固和壮大，全世界汹涌澎湃的和平运动的浪潮，中国人民解放战争的胜利、中华人民共和国的成立和中国四万万七千五百万人民积极参加为和平的斗争，更进一步地加强和巩固了世界民主和平的阵地。与此同时，以美国帝国主义为首的侵略阵营的力量，正在滚向下坡路。第一，帝国主义各国正面临日趋严重的经济困难与危机；第二，以美国为首的帝国主义阵营不仅因遭受到世界人民的严重反对而陷于极端孤立的地位，而且由于对外侵略政策的到处碰壁到处失败，以及经济危机日益加深的结果，其内部矛盾必然而且已经日益尖锐，因而使其力量更趋削弱。第三，美国战争挑拨者，一向以原子武器作为策动侵略战争和讹诈的法宝，但是这个法宝早已是不灵了。日前塔斯社关于苏联早已拥有原子武器但是苏联仍然坚持消毁一切原子武器的声明，表示了世界民主和平阵营力量的更为强大，给了原子黩武主义者以沉重的打击，使美国帝国主义及其喽罗们惊慌失措。
    中国人民解放战争胜利的经验证明：侵略阵营的首脑美国帝国主义只是一只纸老虎，这只纸老虎已被苏联、中国和其他各国的革命人民完全戳穿了，戳得遍体鳞伤了。因此，只要全世界各国爱好和平的人们继续努力，更进一步地加强为和平的斗争，把“国际和平斗争日”的精神贯彻到今后日常的、持久的斗争中去，加强与苏联和人民民主国家的持久友谊，巩固和平民主的力量，那么，新战争挑拨者的阴谋就一定将被打得粉碎。和平的胜利是属于世界人们的。
