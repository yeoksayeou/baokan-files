　　Turning Sandy Wasteland into Orchards
　　Ling Daxie, Jia Erhu
　　(I) The Long-Barren Nangangzi
　　South of Gujun Village in Xingtang County, there is a large sandy wasteland located at the northernmost end of the Shendao Beach. It is said that no one has cultivated it for four or five hundred years. The section belonging to Gujun Village stretches approximately one thousand meters east-west and three hundred meters north-south. It is bordered by the sandy wasteland of Hehe Village to the south, with the county road (Xingtang County to Gujun Village) running through the center. The soil is a mixture of coarse sand and gravel, extremely lacking in humus due to years of neglect. According to villagers, the spring drought can reach a depth of 1.5 to 2 feet each year. The sandy wasteland is more than twenty feet above the ground level of Gujun Village, so villagers generally call it "Nangangzi" (South Ridge). Because it protrudes above the surface, it is subject to strong wind erosion. On the ridge, in addition to wild jujube trees, there are only a few wild grasses such as arrow grass, lousewort, thinleaf milkwort, artemisia, sand reed, and foxtail grass. Within ten zhang (approx. 33 meters) of the sandy wasteland, near the ground, there are trees like large-leaf poplar, small-leaf poplar, willow, Chinese arborvitae, locust, jujube, as well as wild locust flowers and wild peas. There are also semi-utilized and fixed cultivated lands.

　　(II) Persuading and Mobilizing to Establish Windbreak Belts
　　When we discovered that this sandy wasteland was the northernmost end of the Shendao Beach, the starting point for the West Hebei Sandy Land Afforestation Bureau's objective to eliminate sandy land, we visited Zhao Lojiu, an activist and experienced farmer in the village. He was sixty-three years old, a Communist Party member, and highly respected in the village. After persuasive work, he envisioned a beautiful future in his mind, established a firm resolve, and accepted our suggestion to turn the sandy wasteland into an orchard.
　　First, through visual estimation and measurement with a bow ruler, we learned that the land area was about five hundred mu (approx. 33 hectares). A basic main forest belt was established at the northern end, with plans to plant eleven lines of trees. This year, during the rainy season, we started on the west side of the highway, with an east-west length of one thousand eight hundred and ninety chi (approx. 630 meters), row spacing of five chi (approx. 1.67 meters), and plant spacing of one zhang (approx. 3.3 meters) and five chi. Bow-shaped layering was used for five-chi spacing, and cross-layering of buckthorn seedlings was used for one-zhang spacing (two seedlings per hole). Triangular pegs were inserted between the rows to press the layers, with the intention of achieving canopy closure within two years. South of the basic main forest belt, main forest belts were established every twenty-five zhang (approx. 83 meters), totaling four belts, each with six rows of buckthorn seedlings layered using the same method as above.
　　In order to effectively prevent wind and sand, several secondary forest belts must be established in the north-south direction to complete the windbreak belt network and reduce the strong wind blowing from the west. The distance between the secondary forest belts is also twenty-five zhang, so that the main and secondary forest belts intersect at right angles, cutting the land into several blocks, each with an area of ​​625 square zhang, equivalent to about 10.4 mu (approx. 0.7 hectares).
　　Each secondary forest belt has three rows of buckthorn seedlings layered, and the afforestation method is the same as the main forest belt. However, the two secondary forest belts on the eastern and western boundaries are specially thickened and widened, with six rows each, forming two main forest belts.
　　According to this plan, two-thirds of the western area was completed during this year's rainy season. A basic main forest belt, six main forest belts, and six secondary forest belts, a total of thirteen belts, were created, with sixty-five rows of trees planted, totaling 49 li (approx. 24.5 kilometers) in length, with six thousand buckthorn seedling holes, eliminating 316 mu (approx. 21 hectares) of sandy wasteland, and establishing twenty-five orchards (eighteen square, two restricted by terrain, and five divided by the highway). Within each square of land, the masses of Gujun Village plan to plant pear, jujube, apricot, and persimmon trees. They have already ordered 10,000 *du li* (棠梨 *Malus betulifolia*) seedlings and 20 jin (approx. 10 kilograms) of apricot kernels from nearby villages, preparing to plant and sow them after autumn.
　　Based on the experience of Danish windbreak belts, the protected distance of land protected by windbreak belts can reach ten to twelve times the height of the trees. Hungarian windbreak experience tells us that the benefit distance can reach fifteen to twenty times. The orchard we designed for Gujun Village is 25 zhang square, with a miniature demonstration effect. When the tree height is two zhang, the benefit range can reach twenty to forty zhang (ten to twenty times). Small-leaf poplar, under appropriate closure conditions, can reach a height of three zhang even in poor soil. The masses of Gujun Village also plan to graft some small-leaf poplars into large-leaf poplars, and the tree height can reach five or six zhang. Therefore, within the range of twenty-five zhang, it can more successfully complete its due wind and sand prevention tasks.
　　As for the tree species for the windbreak, small-leaf poplar is the main species, accounting for 95%, followed by willow, jujube, and *du li*, accounting for 5%.
　　In order to more effectively complete the closure, the masses of Gujun Village accepted the suggestion of the afforestation bureau's work team and passed a public agreement prohibiting grass cutting and wild jujube root digging in the forest land.

　　(III) The Masses Enthusiastically Participate in the Afforestation Cooperative
　　After Comrade Zhao Lojiu understood the benefits of the windbreak belts, he raised this issue for discussion at the village cadre meeting. Village cadres Dong Luomiao, Fu Luozao, Fu Erduo, Chuan Shicai, Jia Jishu, and others, as well as the women's federation members Zhao Mingqin, Fu Xiaopang, and Fu Wenxiao, also actively participated, organized the "Gujun Village Sandy Wasteland Afforestation Cooperative," and set up investigation, mobilization, and inspection teams to start activities. After several days of preparation, they launched a widespread propaganda campaign among the masses. Blackboards, rooftop broadcasts, and meetings all focused on this central issue to promote it. When the time was ripe, the masses came to sign up in large numbers, on a household basis, with 180 households participating. Because the land is owned by the whole village, and the saplings are also cut from the village-owned forest, whoever provides labor is a shareholder. On the morning of July 26th, gongs rang from every corner of the village, calling on members to eat quickly, take tools, gather quickly, and strive to start early and complete early. A total of five days were spent planting, with 110 male workers, 50 women, and 20 young men and women participating each day, totaling 180 people, divided into groups of ten, with one group leader selected by themselves (targeting experienced old farmers). There were a total of eighteen groups, and all issues were democratically assessed. Male workers and young people were responsible for collecting tree saplings, digging pits, and planting, while women were responsible for transporting branches. They completed 49 li (approx. 24.5 kilometers) of afforestation and pressed 9,000 buckthorn seedling holes under such planned and organized conditions.

　　After completing the afforestation work, they also drafted regulations, prepared a list of shareholder names, and submitted them to the county district for record, in order to protect forest rights.

　　要把沙荒变果园
    凌大燮  贾尔虎
   （一）荒芜多年的南岗子
    行唐县故郡村南，有一大块沙荒地，在神道滩的最北端，相传四五百年没人耕种。属于故郡村的一片，东西约一千公尺，南北约三百公尺，南邻合河村沙荒地，有县郡公路（行唐县城通故郡村）横穿中央。土质系粗砂及砾混合而成，因多年荒废，极端缺乏腐植质。据村民说：每年春旱最深可达一尺半至二尺。该沙荒高出故郡村地平二十尺以上，所以一般村民称它叫“南岗子”，因越突出地表，越受强风的吹袭，岗上除酸枣外，仅有箭草、虱子草、远志、艾蒿、沙蓬、狼尾巴草等少数野草；在沙荒地十丈内外近地，有大叶杨、小叶杨、柳、侧柏、槐、枣及野槐花、野豌豆，也有半利用地和固定耕地。
    （二）说服动员建立防风林带
    当我们发现了这一块沙荒是神道滩的最北端，也就是冀西沙荒造林局要消灭的对象开始处，就到村中访问积极分子老农赵洛久，他年已六十三岁，是共产党员，在村中颇有威望，经过说服工作后，他在脑子里绘了一个美丽的远景，立定了坚决的信心，接受我们的建议把沙荒变为果园。
    先经过目测及用弓尺丈量，知道土地面积大约五百亩，在北端建立一道基本主林带，计划植林十一道。本年雨季，先在公路西侧着手，东西长一千八百九十尺，行距五尺，株距分一丈及五尺两种，弓形压条法为五尺，交叉法压卜子为一丈（每穴二个卜子），行与行用三角形插当子压条，预定二年内可以郁闭。在基本主林带的南方，每隔二十五丈，平行建立主林带一道，共计四道，每道压卜子六行，造林法同上。
    为了有效防风防沙，必需在南北方向再建立副林带若干道，完成防风林带网，以减低西面吹来的强风。副林带的相互间距离也是二十五丈，使主副林带直角交错，把土地切成若干方块，每块面积六百二十五方丈，约合十亩四分地。
    副林带每道压卜子三行，造林法也和主林带一样，但东西境界的两副林带，特别加厚加宽，计每道六行，成为主林带二道。
    按照此项计划，本年雨季，先完成西部三分之二面积。计造成基本主林带一道，主林带六道，副林带六道，共计十三道，造林六十五行，总延长线四十九里，压卜子六千穴，消灭沙荒三百十六亩，建立果园二十五块（其中正方形十八块，受地形限制的二块，被公路割裂的五块）。在每一方块土地内，故郡村群众计划栽梨、枣、杏、柿树。他们已向附近村订购杜梨卜子一万株，杏核二十斤，准备秋后栽植及播种。
    根据丹麦防风林带的经验，受防风林保护的土地距离，可达树高十倍至十二倍，匈牙利防风林的经验告诉我们：受益距离可达十五倍至二十倍。我们为故郡村设计的果园是二十五丈见方，有袖珍示范作用存在。当树高二丈时，受益范围，可达二十丈至四十丈（即十倍至二十倍），小叶杨在适当郁闭条件下，虽然土质恶劣，可达三丈之高，故郡村群众还有计划把部分小叶杨接成大叶杨，树高可达五六丈，因此，在二十五丈范围内，更可胜利地完成它应尽的防风防沙的任务。
    至于防风林的树种，主要是小叶杨，占百分之九十五，其次是柳、枣、杜梨，共占百分之五。
    为了更有效地完成郁闭，故郡村群众接受造林局工作组的建议，通过一条公约，禁止在林地内割草及掘酸枣根。
    （三）群众热烈参加造林合作社
    赵洛久同志了解防风林带的好处以后，在村干部会议中，提出讨论此一问题，村干部董洛妙、傅洛座、傅二多、传世材、贾吉书等，妇联会赵明琴、傅小胖、傅文霄等也都积极起来了，组织了“故郡村沙荒造林合作社”，下设调查、动员、检查三股，开始活动，经过几天酝酿，向群众普遍展开宣传工作，黑板报、屋顶广播、碰头会，都以此为中心问题，向群众宣传。时间成熟了，群众纷纷来报名，以户为单位，参加了一百八十户。因为土地是全村共有的，秧树也是由村有林上斫下来的，只有谁出劳动力，谁就是股东，七月二十六日清晨，铜锣从全村各个角落响起，号召会员快吃饭，快拿工具，快集合，争取早动手早完成。一共栽了五天，每天参加男工一百一十人，妇女五十人，青少年男女二十名，共计一百八十人，以十人为一小组，自选小组长一人（以对造林有经验的老农为对象）。共十八个小组，一切问题，民主评定。男工和青少年担任采树秧子、刨坑和种植，妇女担任运送枝子。他们就在这样有计划有组织的条件下，完成四十九里造林，压卜子九千穴。
    他们在造林工作完成后，并起草拟定章程，开具股东姓名，送县区备案，以保障林权。
