Report from Inner Mongolia by our correspondent Ai Fang

At 7 p.m. on September 21st, in Ulanhot, Hailar, Manzhouli, Zhalantun, along various transportation lines, in mines, forests, factories, schools, and government offices, when the voice of the People's Political Consultative Conference resounded loudly from the radio, it immediately aroused cheers and boundless excitement. The news spread like lightning to rural areas, grasslands, and every corner! Wherever it spread, excitement and laughter followed. Chairman Mao declared to the people of the whole country and the people of the world: "A quarter of humanity, the Chinese people, have stood up! Our revolution has won the sympathy and cheers of the broad masses of people throughout the world, and our friends are all over the world." His voice was so full and powerful that the continuous applause at the CPPCC meeting merged with the applause of audiences everywhere. In various parts of Inner Mongolia, the reporter saw how people were intently gathered around radios, listening carefully to every word of Chairman Mao's opening speech. On the trains running from Chengzi to Qiqihar, and from Qiqihar to Hailar and Manzhouli, a new program has been added in recent days. Before the train conductor and ticket inspector report the train schedule and epidemic prevention, they report a segment of news from the People's Political Consultative Conference, which is the most attention-grabbing. The silence of the train and the hopeful gazes of everyone are focused on the reporter until the last sentence is finished. On the last day of the "Nadam" fair for the grassland herdsmen, news of the People's Political Consultative Conference arrived, and the herdsmen celebrated with newly learned Yangko dances. From September 26th to October 2nd, various localities have more systematically led mass gatherings and entertainment activities, and held unprecedented celebrations for the founding of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and the International Day for Struggle for Peace. The joy and happiness expressed by the people of Inner Mongolia from the bottom of their hearts is not difficult to imagine. For three hundred years, the people of Inner Mongolia lived an inhuman life under the oppression of foreign ethnic groups and feudal princes. The language of the Mongolian people was scolded by reactionary rulers as "livestock language." Under the extremely high extra-economic exploitation, the people were so poor that young women didn't even have pants to wear. Japanese imperialism used despicable means to widely spread germs here, poisoning the people of Inner Mongolia. But now, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the people of Inner Mongolia have been liberated after arduous struggles, their lives have improved, they are listed in the big family of the Chinese nation with equal status, and they stand up together with the people of other fraternal ethnic groups, and this status is permanently guaranteed. At a forum of women cadres convened by the Inner Mongolia Women's Federation on September 29th, everyone exchanged their feelings since the opening of the People's Political Consultative Conference, representing the feelings of thousands of women in Inner Mongolia. They welcomed these days with unparalleled joy and proactive actions. The daily newspapers are what everyone cares about most. They reminisce about the past, compare it with the present, and look to the future. Many people shed tears of joy and gratitude during the excited conversations. They said in unison: This is the result of the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Everyone unanimously expressed their determination to work hard and strengthen their studies to cherish their country, respond to Chairman Mao's call, and support all the resolutions of the CPPCC. Wang Shutang, an old worker from the Wushi @Xi factory, told reporters amidst the sound of gongs and drums that more than 40 workers in their factory had launched a campaign to save coal and oil, guaranteeing no problems and guaranteeing that the old machine would not lose power in the future, to celebrate the birth of the new China. A farmer in the Tieshi suburb of Wushi said happily: "In the past, who dared to come here when the Japanese devils were around? They would arrest you and make you a laborer. Now, this is our own place." In recent days, national flags have been flying over Inner Mongolia, and the Mongolian and Han people are immersed in revelry.

　　内蒙人民的欢呼
    本报驻内蒙记者  艾方
    九月二十一日晚七时，在乌兰浩特、海拉尔、满洲里、札兰屯，在各交通线，在矿山，森林，工厂，学校，机关，人民政协的声音，从无线电收音机响亮的传出时，顿时激起了一片欢呼和无限兴奋。消息闪电般地传至农村、草地及各个角落！传到哪里，兴奋和欢笑便到了哪里。毛主席向全国人民，全世界人民宣告：“占人类总数四分之一的中国人从此站起来了，我们的革命已经获得全世界广大人民的同情和欢呼，我们的朋友遍及全世界。”声音那样饱满而有力，政协会议上连续掌声和各地听众的掌声合成了一起。在内蒙各地，记者看到人们如何在聚精会神围在收音机前，侧耳细听毛主席开幕词的每一句话。从的城子开向齐齐哈尔，从齐齐哈尔开向海拉尔、满洲里去的列车上，连日来又增加了一个新节目，在列车长和检票员报告行车时间及防疫卫生之前，向大家报告一段人民政协会的消息，这是最引人注意的了。列车的肃静和每个人用充满希望的目光，注视着报告者讲完最后的一句话。在草地牧民们“那达慕”大会的最后一日，人民政协消息传来了，牧民们以新学的秧歌舞舞蹈庆祝。从九月二十六到十月二日，各地更有计划的领导了群众的各种集会和娱乐活动，各地并举行了空前规模的庆祝中华人民共和国中央人民政府成立和国际和平斗争日的大会。内蒙人民从内心里发出的这种欢欣愉快，这是不难设想的。三百年来内蒙人民在异民族及封建王公欺压之下过着非人的生活，蒙古人民的语言被反动统治者骂为“牲口话”，在高度超经济剥削下，使人民穷困得青年的妇女连裤子都没的穿。日本帝国主义曾以卑鄙的手段在这里广泛散发出毒菌，毒害内蒙人民。可是现在，内蒙人民在中国共产党领导下经过艰苦奋斗得到了解放，人民生活改善了，以平等的地位列于中国这个民族的大家庭内，与其他各兄弟民族人民大众一起站起来了，而且这种地位有了永久地保障。九月二十九日内蒙妇联所召开的妇女干部座谈会上，大家交谈着人民政协开会以来的心情，代表着内蒙千千万万妇女的心情。他们都是以无比的高兴和积极的行动迎接着这些日子的。每天的报纸是大家所最关心的，他们追述过去，比比现在，看看将来，好些人在激动的谈话中流出了欢欣和感激的眼泪。他们异口同声的说：这是中国共产党领导的结果。大家一致表示以努力工作加强学习来爱护自己的国家，响应毛主席的号召，拥护政协的一切决议。乌市＠熹厂的老工人王树棠，在锣鼓喧天中告诉记者，他们全厂四十多个工人展开节约煤和油的运动，保证不出毛病，并保证今后那个老机器不停电，来庆祝新中国的诞生。乌市铁西郊区的一个农民愉快的说：“过去日本鬼子在时谁敢向这里来？来了就把你抓了劳工，现在可是咱自己的地方了。”连日来，内蒙各地上空国旗飘扬，蒙汉人民都浸润在狂欢中。
