　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 2nd. Comprehensive reports from TASS: After the Soviet government announced the abolition of the Soviet-Yugoslav treaty, newspapers in Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria, the United States, Britain, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden, Finland, and other countries have published it and commented on it.

　　The Hungarian Workers' Party's Free People's Daily stated: The trial of Rajk showed that the Tito faction first provoked their own people against the Soviet Union, and then, through their agents, turned the people of the new democratic countries against the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union is friendly to the people of Yugoslavia, but not to the executioners who harmed the freedom of the Yugoslav people and sold out Yugoslavia's independence. The Soviet government's abolition of the Soviet-Yugoslav treaty is guided by the sincere and inseparable friendship between the two peoples.

　　The Polish newspaper Warsaw reported: The Soviet note to the Yugoslav government has confirmed that the Yugoslav government has trampled on and torn up the 1945 Soviet-Yugoslav treaty. The Tito faction concluded a treaty of friendship with the Soviet Union to facilitate their subversive activities against the Soviet Union.

　　The Bulgarian newspaper Izgrev pointed out: The Soviet-Yugoslav treaty has been torn up due to the Yugoslav government's hostile and subversive activities against the Soviet Union, which it has conducted and continues to conduct. The British Communist Party's Workers' Daily pointed out that the Tito government trampled on and tore up the Soviet-Yugoslav treaty. The Finnish Communist Party's Työkansan Sanomat, the Swedish Communist Party's Ny Dag, the Belgian Communist Party's Red Flag, the Berlin Daily, and others also commented on the Tito clique's tearing up of the Soviet-Yugoslav treaty.

　　苏联宣布废除苏南条约世界进步舆论一致赞扬
    并斥责铁托分子破坏条约罪行
    【新华社北京二日电】综合塔斯社消息：苏联政府宣布废除苏南条约后，匈、波、保、美、英、德、比、荷兰、瑞典、芬兰等国各报纸纷纷刊载，并予评论。
    匈牙利工人党自由人民报称：对拉伊克的审讯表明铁托分子首先挑拨他们自己的人民反对苏联，然后通过他们的代理人，使新民主主义国家的人民反对苏联。苏联对南斯拉夫人民是友好的，然而对他们残害南斯拉夫人民自由的刽子手、出卖南斯拉夫独立的人却不友好。苏联政府废除苏南条约，便是为两国人民之间诚挚而不可分的友谊感情指导着的。
    波兰华沙报称：苏联致南斯拉夫政府的照会业已确证南斯拉夫政府蹂躏与撕毁了一九四五年的苏南条约，铁托分子与苏联缔结友好条约，乃是为了便利他们对苏联的颠覆活动。
    保加利亚伊兹格列夫报指出：苏南条约已因南斯拉夫政府对苏联曾进行且仍继续敌对与颠覆活动而撕毁了。英共工人日报指出铁托政府践踏并撕毁了苏南条约。芬共杜坎森·杉诺玛报、瑞典共产党尼·达格报、比共红旗报、柏林日报等亦评论铁托集团撕毁苏南条约。
