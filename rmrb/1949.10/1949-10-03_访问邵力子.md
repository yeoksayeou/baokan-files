Visiting Shao Lizi

　　"Only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao can the people of the whole country stand up and achieve true peace." "Bargaining with and begging the reactionaries will never bring peace." This is the practical experience that Shao Lizi, a specially invited representative to the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, has gleaned from numerous peace efforts. He cherishes this experience, and he believes it to be a truth. When the reporter met with him, he affirmed and repeatedly told the reporter this. He expressed his infinite joy at the convening of the National People's Political Consultative Conference, which demonstrated the victory of the people and unprecedented unity, and opened a new page in Chinese history, and vowed to work with utmost sincerity to implement the Common Program of the People's Political Consultative Conference and all the resolutions of the People's Political Consultative Conference!

　　However, in addition to joy, Shao Lizi was reminded of many painful past events.

　　He first revealed the essence of the old Political Consultative Conference to the reporter with extremely heavy feelings. He said: "I also participated in the Political Consultative Conference three years ago. But what was that? It was a grand conspiracy by the Jiang Jieshi reactionaries to sell out the people and the motherland, attach themselves to American imperialism, maintain their reactionary, dictatorial, and traitorous rule, prepare for civil war, and attempt to shift the responsibility for the civil war onto the Communist Party. Therefore, although the meeting place shouted 'Peace! Peace!', Cangbaitang and Jiaochangkou were filled with secret agents and thugs, full of murderous intent, beating and threatening democratic人士 who advocated peace!" Speaking of this, Shao Lizi couldn't help but show a look of apology on his face. But after a moment, he lowered his voice and said with emotion to the reporter: "We can't help but think of Chairman Mao! He spared no effort at that Political Consultative Conference for the survival of the people of the whole country and the realization of peace!" He expressed his infinite respect for the great people's leader Chairman Mao.

　　Then, Shao Lizi powerfully exposed the conspiracy of the Kuomintang reactionaries to oppose the people and play with peace, based on the results of his two failed efforts for peace this year. He said: "On February 14, Mr. Yan Huiqing, Mr. Jiang Yong, Mr. Zhang Shizhao, and I, representing the people of Shanghai and at the invitation of Li Zongren, came to see Chairman Mao. We believed that the conditions Chairman Mao put forward to the reactionaries at that time were very generous, and we considered them very satisfactory and hopeful. Therefore, on February 27, we returned to Nanjing with high hopes. What was the result? I was disappointed as soon as I got off the plane in Nanjing. But I was still always dreaming of restoring peace. Therefore, on April 1, I came to Beijing as a member of the Nanjing delegation. We knew that the peace needed by the people and the country was true and lasting peace, not false peace; we accepted the 'Eight Articles and Twenty-Four Clauses of the Domestic Peace Agreement' because we clearly saw that only by recognizing the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, which is supported by the vast number of people, and only by thoroughly transforming the reactionary troops into the people's troops by the people's own troops – the People's Liberation Army – to serve the people, can we hope to achieve true peace. On April 16, we forwarded the 'Eight Articles and Twenty-Four Clauses of the Domestic Peace Agreement' to Nanjing. It was not until the evening of the 20th that we received a reply from Nanjing: refusing to sign and insisting on continuing the anti-people civil war!"

　　"The facts of the past few years have told me," Shao Lizi said in a very firm tone, "true peace must be striven for and protected by the people's own strength, and cannot be obtained by bargaining with the reactionaries! In the future, we must unite closely under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao and struggle tenaciously in order to move forward towards the future of peaceful construction!"

　　At this point, Shao Lizi said very seriously to the reporter: "To be frank, during the old Political Consultative Conference, I was still standing on the side of the Kuomintang, not on the side of the people."

　　"From my constant failures and reviews in my efforts for peace, my ideological understanding has gradually improved. Especially after the failure of the peace efforts in April this year, I decided to stay in Beijing with my wife. In six months, I read many revolutionary theory books, especially the help from Chairman Mao and other leaders of the CCP, and I felt really enlightened."

　　He brought the topic back again and talked about the People's Political Consultative Conference that is currently being held with a bright mood. Shao Lizi said: "Judging from the various processes and achievements of the conference, I am increasingly convinced that the National People's Political Consultative Conference and the Central People's Government are the most powerful fortresses for consolidating peace, truly represent the will of the people of the whole country, and have realized the great unity of the people of the whole country. The opinions of the three major historical documents – the Common Program of the People's Political Consultative Conference, etc. – the current great charter of the Chinese people, which were discussed and approved at this conference, were drafted after group research and discussion by the preparatory committee; after the opening of the conference, they were extensively collected, repeatedly revised and supplemented, and fully demonstrated people's democracy. The conference was truly conducted in a spirit of harmony, unity, and seamlessness. It increasingly shows that the People's Political Consultative Conference truly serves the people. The people of the whole country can also see this clearly. Therefore, many old gentlemen who have not asked about politics for many years because they hate the evil policies of the old government, such as Zhang Nanxian, Li Shucheng, Ning Wu, etc., the elders of the Chinese Tongmenghui, were delighted to hear that the People's Political Consultative Conference was being convened, and they resolutely came to participate despite their age, which is not accidental."

　　Shao Lizi told the reporter even more excitedly: "In the midst of the conference, we saw Truman's statement about the Soviet Union having atomic weapons, which the imperialists have always been unwilling to admit, but today they have to admit. This news, along with the birth of the People's Republic of China, simultaneously makes the imperialists tremble and also encourages and rejoices peace-loving people all over the world. The people of China and the Soviet Union will unite closely together in the future and jointly be faithful guarantors of world peace. Our responsibility is becoming even greater."

　　"Let the imperialists and their running dogs, the reactionaries, tremble! The giant of the East, the Chinese people, has finally won victory and stood up stubbornly! The wishes of the Chinese people have finally been realized—an independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, prosperous, and strong People's Republic of China has finally been born victoriously!" Shao Lizi smiled as he depicted the bright future of the people's country, ending his conversation with the reporter.

　　访问邵力子
    “只有在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，全国人民站立起来，才能实现真正的和平。”“向反动派讨价还价，哀求乞怜，是永远得不到和平的。”这是中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议特别邀请代表邵力子，从数次和平努力中，摸索出来的实际体验。这个体验，他很珍贵，他认为这是个真理。当记者会见他时，他很肯定而反复的向记者这样谈述着。他对这次表现人民胜利，空前大团结，在中国历史上展开新的一页的全国人民政治协商会议的召开，表示无限欣慰，并誓以至诚，为实现人民政协会议共同纲领及人民政协的一切决议而努力！
    但，邵力子于欢欣之余，却联想起许多痛苦的往事。
    他首先以极其沉痛的心情向记者揭露了旧政协的本质。他说：“三年前的政协会议，我也参加了。但那是什么呢？那是蒋介石反动派为了出卖人民祖国，依附美帝国主义，保持反动独裁卖国统治，准备内战，并企图把内战责任向共产党身上推的大阴谋，因而尽管会场上高喊：“和平！和平！”而在沧白堂，较场口，却遍布特务打手，杀气腾腾，殴打威胁倡导和平的民主人士！”谈到这里，邵力子面上不禁流露歉然之色。但停了片刻，他又低声地感慨地对记者说：“我们不能不想起毛主席呀！他为了全国人民的生存，实现和平，在那次政协会议上是费尽了心血的！”他对伟大的人民领袖毛主席表示无限崇敬。
    接着邵力子又从他今年两次致力和平的失败结果，有力的揭穿了国民党反动派，反对人民，玩弄和平的阴谋。他说：“二月十四日，我和颜惠庆、江庸、章士钊等先生，代表上海各界人民，并应李宗仁之请，来见毛主席，我们认为毛主席当时对反动派提的条件，非常宽大，我们认为很圆满，觉得很有希望，因而于二月二十七日怀着满腔热望回到了南京。结果呢？在南京一下飞机，我就失望了。但还是时时刻刻憧憬于恢复和平的好梦。故四月一日我又作为南京代表团的一员来到北京。我们知道人民和国家所需要的和平，是真正的持久的和平，而不是虚伪的和平；我们接受了‘国内和平协定八条二十四款’，因为我们看清了只有承认广大人民所拥护的中国共产党领导政权，只有由人民自己的部队——人民解放军来彻底改造反动的部队成为人民的部队，为人民服务，才有达到真正和平的希望。四月十六日，我们把‘国内和平协定八条二十四款’转给了南京，直到二十日晚，才得到南京回电：拒绝签字，还是要坚持反人民内战！”
    “几年来的事实告诉了我，”邵力子语气很坚定的说：“真正的和平，必须用人民自己的力量，来争取与保护，而不是可以向反动派讨价还价得到的！我们今后一定要在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，密切的团结，坚韧的奋斗，才可以向和平建设的前途迈进！”
    至此，邵力子又很严肃的对记者说：“我们坦白的说，在旧政协会议的时候，我还是站在国民党的立场的，而不是站在人民的立场上的。”
    “从我致力和平的不断失败与检讨中，思想认识是在逐渐提高的。特别是在今年四月的和平努力失败后，我决心和内人留到北京，六个月中我读了不少革命理论书籍，尤其是毛主席及中共其他领袖对我的帮助，感到心里真是透亮了。”
    他又把话头拉回来，心情开朗的谈起现在正在召开的人民政协了。邵力子说：“我从大会种种经过和所得成果来看，愈加相信全国人民政治协商会议和中央人民政府是巩固和平最有力的堡垒，是真正代表着全国人民的意志，实现了全国人民的大团结。这次会议所讨论通过的人民政治协商会议共同纲领等三大历史文献——中国人民当前的大宪章的意见，是经过筹备会分组研究讨论拟定草案；会议开幕以后，又复集思广益，反复修正补充，充分发挥了人民民主。会议真正是在欢洽和谐，团结无间的精神下进行的。愈益显出人民政治协商会议是真正为人民服务的。对此，全国人民也看得清清楚楚，因而许多因痛恶旧政府恶政，多少年来即不问政治的老先生，如中国同盟会的老人张难先、李书城、甯武等先生，欣闻召开人民政治协商会议，都不顾衰老，毅然前来参加，并不是偶然的。”
    邵力子又更为兴奋的语记者：“在大会正进行之中，我们看到了杜鲁门等对于苏联已有原子武器的声明，这是帝国主义者一向不愿承认，而今天又不得不承认的。这和中华人民共和国诞生的消息，同时使帝国主义者发抖，也同时使全世界爱好和平者的鼓舞欢欣。中苏两国人民今后将紧紧团结在一起，共同为世界和平的忠实保障者，我们的责任是越发重大了。”
    “让帝国主义者及其走狗反动派发抖吧！东方的巨人，中国人民终于获得了胜利，倔强的站立起来了！中国人民的愿望终于实现了——一个独立、民主、和平、统一、富强的中华人民共和国终于胜利诞生了！”邵力子微笑地描绘着人民国家的光明前途，结束了他和记者的谈话。
