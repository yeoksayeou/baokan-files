　　Twenty Years of Unyielding Struggle
　　Qīng Mù
　　On August 25, 1949, a historically significant meeting was held in Changsha. On this day, the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Hunan Provincial Working Committee of the CPC, which had persisted in underground work in Hunan for more than twenty years, victoriously joined forces.
　　Opening the history of the underground CPC in Hunan, people will clearly see what unconquerable people the Communist Party members are. The twenty years of arduous and unyielding struggle of the Hunan underground party precisely illustrate that the flame of truth of communism is forever irresistible. Since the failure of the Great Revolution, the Party has consistently upheld the revolutionary struggle in Hunan. In 1934, when the Red Army went north to resist Japan, what the Party left behind in Hunan, in addition to the deep revolutionary influence among the masses, was only a central county party committee in the border area of Xiang, Yue, and Gan between Ling County and Suichuan. At that time, there was an armed force nominally called the Ling Sui Independent Battalion, but in reality, it was only about two hundred people and a hundred or so guns, plus two county governments and other rear personnel, totaling about five hundred people. But even such a small force initially resisted the armed attacks of two enemy brigades. The bandits built bunkers everywhere in an area of two to three hundred square miles, dividing the Soviet area into more than ten small blocks, and carried out blockades and sweeps. Within the Soviet area, the bandits burned down all the houses of the people, drove away the residents, and transported the grain out; most of the young and middle-aged men were murdered by the bandit army under the charge of being "bandit people." In coordination with this blockade, the bandits also frequently pursued the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army guerrillas with a regiment of troops, and used most of their forces to shuttle and clear the area day and night. The situation in the Soviet area was quite serious at that time. But this small revolutionary armed force headed by Zhou Li did not show the slightest timidity in this cruel environment. During the enemy's blockade, for three or four months, they did not eat a single grain of food, completely relying on grass and fruit to survive. When the enemy's attack was urgent, they went without food for several days without rest to contend with the enemy. Sometimes, they were so exhausted that they simply fell asleep on the mountains at night. Once, the enemy's mountain search troops passed by their clothes, but neither side noticed. This arduous struggle continued for several months. In the entire Soviet area, only three residents and a pile of ashes remained in the end, and even the thatch on the mountains was burned by the enemy. Grain had to be prepared three hundred miles away. Due to long-term hunger and cruel battles, the troops eventually only preserved more than one hundred people. These steel-forged warriors, although in this unprecedentedly serious juncture, their firm and unwavering revolutionary will and their unwavering confidence in completing the lofty cause of communism, constantly encouraged them to fight the enemy.
　　In 1935, Cai Huiwen, the commander-in-chief of the Red Army left behind in the Jiangxi Soviet Area, led more than one hundred people and guns into Hunan to join them. At that time, because the Ling Sui Soviet Area was only left with a barren mountain, and there was no need to persist any longer, it was decided to develop outwards and transfer to the triangular area of Guidong, Shangyou, and Chongyi to create a new guerrilla area. Then, the Xiang Gan Border Detachment was established, with Cai Huiwen as the commander-in-chief and Zhou Li as the political commissar, divided into five or six large detachments, but the total number of people was only three hundred, with more than one hundred and sixty guns. After the troops arrived in the new area, they immediately sent out a dozen or so work groups to mobilize the masses everywhere, organize poor peasant groups, and opened up work in an area of nine hundred miles. After half a year, a new situation was opened up. When the enemy started attacking again, they suffered a severe blow from the Red Army, and an entire enemy battalion was wiped out by us. This immediately attracted the enemy's attention, and they organized the military forces of the three provinces of Guangdong, Jiangxi, and Hunan to carry out "encirclement and suppression" of the Red Army. In April 1935, the headquarters of our Xiang Gan Border Detachment, with more than twenty people, was surrounded on a mountain west of Guidong. Under the enemy's intense fire, Commander Cai Huiwen led the crowd in a desperate fight. In the end, in order to cover the breakout of other comrades, he unfortunately suffered serious injuries, fell to the ground, and was captured. At that time, the enemy tried to carry him away on a stretcher, but Comrade Cai Huiwen insisted on not going and cursed incessantly. As a result, he was killed on the spot by the enemy. The inhuman enemy even took away his head when they left. Comrade Cai Huiwen had not eaten a single grain of food for half a month before his death. He endured relentless hunger, pretending to have his stomach full of grass roots and tree bark, and died for the revolution. His spirit will live forever.
　　After this setback, the Xiang Gan Border Red Army suffered significant losses. Afterwards, Comrade Zhou Li collected the remaining one hundred and sixty or so people and transferred them to the Eight-Faced Mountain, where they rested for half a year. When the enemy launched another attack, the Red Army accepted the past experience and no longer defended a single area. In order to preserve the revolutionary forces, they retreated to Chaling. In the continuous attacks of the enemy, they were like dragons entering the sea, traversing more than ten counties, with food and the masses. Not only did they not suffer losses, but they slowly grew stronger. In 1936, the Red Army developed into two battalions, reaching more than a thousand people. It was not until the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War in 1937 that they made contact with the Party Central Committee. Following the orders of the CPC Central Committee, they descended from the Eight-Faced Mountain on October 5 of the same year and incorporated this revolutionary armed force, forged in a hundred battles, into the New Fourth Army and went to the front lines of the anti-Japanese war.
　　During the Anti-Japanese War, the CPC underground party in Hunan, again under the leadership of Comrade Zhou Li, carried out anti-Japanese activities. By 1939, the Party had developed to five or six thousand people in various counties in Hunan, playing a decisive role in the anti-Japanese activities of the masses. In this year, the Kuomintang bandit gang began another large-scale massacre of our underground party. In the "Pingjiang Massacre," more than a dozen cadres of our New Fourth Army's liaison office were brutally murdered. At the same time, no less than a thousand Red Army family members and other revolutionary elements in Pingjiang were killed. Among them, eight brothers of a Red Army family were killed, leaving only two. And these were only the beginning of the counter-revolutionary executioners' conspiracy. Then, in 1941, the Anhui Incident, which shocked China and the world, broke out. A white terror of counter-revolution enveloped the whole country for a time. Under this circumstance, the CPC underground party in Hunan suffered even more from the frenzied arrest and massacre of counter-revolutionaries, and the organization throughout the province suffered unprecedented destruction. In this massacre, the beastly Kuomintang bandit gang, as soon as they discovered revolutionary elements or their suspects, would kill the whole family, and even relatives would be executed together. After Kuang Guangqian, the secretary of the CPC county committee in Ling County, was arrested, he was pierced through both ears with an iron wire by the enemy and forced to walk, then burned alive by pouring kerosene over his head. A guerrilla fighter from Liling was captured, and as a result, his entire family, old and young, were killed together. According to statistics, during this period, a total of sixty underground members of the Communist Party of China were killed in Changsha, more than thirty in Xiangtan, and no less than several hundred in more than ten counties such as Ling County, Guidong, and Anren. Later, in order to preserve strength, the Hunan underground party decided on a policy of large-scale retreat, sending a large number of party members and cadres to the New Fourth Army. In the end, only fifteen party members and two cadres were left behind, and Zhou Li was one of them. From 1940 to 1944, during this long period of time, the Hunan underground party had been lying dormant and accumulating strength. Although the treacherous enemy did not allow them to have any activities, they always steadfastly stuck to their posts. In 1944, the Japanese invaders launched a large-scale offensive, and most of Hunan fell. Comrade Zhou Li then returned to Xiangtan to mobilize the masses to carry out anti-Japanese work behind enemy lines. At that time, Comrade Zhou Li led several party members to visit the masses everywhere, preaching the stories of the Communist Party of China's anti-Japanese activities behind enemy lines, and mobilizing the masses to carry out anti-Japanese and anti-spy struggles. Under the leadership of the Party, many anti-Japanese guerrilla groups were quickly established, totaling more than four hundred people. In the anti-Japanese struggle, the Party further developed more than three hundred and eighty party members. After half a year, a considerable situation was reopened.
　　In 1945, General Wang Zhen's southward troops passed through Xiangtan. The underground party and the anti-Japanese guerrillas held a victorious meeting with them like welcoming their own relatives, and launched a warm consolation campaign, so that the troops who had gone deep into South China and fought hard all the way, had a stable rest for seven days as if they had entered their own base area. Later, when General Wang Zhen went south to Guangdong, he left behind a detachment to cooperate with them in attacking the enemy and developing work, which played a great role in the development and growth of the underground party. In the early days of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the working policy of the Hunan underground party was: on the one hand, to launch a rent reduction movement in the countryside, and on the other hand, to gradually strengthen urban work according to the development of the situation. To this end, Comrade Zhou Li personally led the work in Changsha, first carrying out work in the press and student circles in Changsha, and then penetrating into workers, staff, and some lower-level masses. In three months, one hundred and thirty party members were developed. A mass movement against the civil war and demanding democracy was initially launched.
　　In April 1946, when the anti-communist wave was rising across the country, the Hunan counter-revolutionary authorities also began to persecute progressive elements of the underground party and suppress the patriotic and democratic movement of the people. In July of the same year, the full-scale civil war broke out, and the Kuomintang bandit gang began another large-scale massacre in Hunan. At that time, the underground members of the Communist Party of China and progressive elements, under the instructions of the Party, went out in large numbers to hide, and finally only a few party members remained to persist in their work. In the meantime, many of our excellent comrades were killed. The most important ones were Comrade Su Boao, who was buried alive in Changsha, and Comrade Hu Yousheng, who sacrificed in Xiangtan.
　　Afterwards, the Kuomintang frantically conscripted soldiers and grain in Hunan to expand the civil war, coupled with the crazy suppression of the people's patriotic and democratic movement. The Hunan underground organization of the Communist Party of China further led the masses to extensively launch the struggle against civil war, against conscription, against grain requisition, and against labor conscription, which won the warm support of the people in various places. The party's organization gradually changed from small to large, from schools to factories, and penetrated into various strata. In the summer of 1947, students in Changsha, Yueyang, and other places responded to the anti-civil war and anti-hunger movement of students in Shanghai and held several large-scale parades and demonstrations, which initially set off a revolutionary upsurge of the masses. Subsequently, the salary increase movement of workers and staff, and the movement of public educators to improve their treatment, followed one after another. The Party's organizations in various places not only fully recovered but also developed to more than two thousand people.
　　At this time, due to the continuous victories of the People's Liberation War and the rapid collapse of the Kuomintang reactionary bandit gang in politics and economy, the revolutionary upsurge of the masses was rising, and the situation underwent drastic changes. In addition, the looting of the Bai Chongxi bandit gang in Hunan aroused even more intense battles of the masses "against the bandits and driving out the Gui." In order to welcome this revolutionary upsurge, the Hunan underground party immediately adopted a policy of bold development, and the number of party members increased to more than nine thousand. In Changsha alone, there were more than nine hundred and ninety people. Most of the mass organizations were completely under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, and thousands of people automatically stood on the side of the revolution. This unprecedentedly powerful force enabled the underground party in this period to cooperate with the victorious advance of our People's Liberation Army and to carry out the work completely proactively and in a planned manner until it victoriously won the uprising of Generals Cheng Qian and Chen Mingren and the peaceful liberation of Hunan. Their efforts and contributions are not to be ignored.
　　The Hunan underground party persisted on such a rugged and tortuous road. Twenty years is not a short time. In the cruel struggle with the enemy, they fell and got up again. For the liberation of the Chinese people, they struggled arduously and selflessly and finally persevered until victory. In these twenty years of heroic and unyielding struggle, they not only expanded the Party's influence, developed the Party's strength, and organized the masses of all strata, but also cultivated a group of excellent cadres, giving great help to the Party's work in Hunan in the future. Just as Comrade Wang Shoudao, secretary of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, said at the joining forces meeting on August 25: "Comrade Zhou Li and other comrades of the Hunan underground party insisted on working for twenty years as if it was just one day. It is the glory of our Party, and their spirit is worthy of the whole Party's learning."

　　二十年不屈的斗争
  　新华社长沙通讯
    青穆
    一九四九年八月二十五日，在长沙举行了一个有历史意义的会议。这一天，中国共产党湖南省委会和坚持湖南地下工作二十余年的中共湖南省工作委员会胜利地会师了。
    翻开湖南中共地下党的历史，人们就会清楚地看到共产党员都是一些怎样不可征服的人们。湖南地下党二十年艰苦不屈的斗争，正说明着共产主义的真理之火是永远不可抗御的。自从大革命失败以后，党就一直坚持着湖南的革命斗争。一九三四年红军北上抗日，党所留在湖南的，除去在群众中深厚的革命影响外，只剩下酃县、遂川交界地区湘粤赣边的一个中心县委了。当时名义上还有一个酃遂独立营的武装，实际上不过二百人和一百多条枪，加上两个县政府及其他后方工作人员，共约五百人。但就是这样一点小小的力量，一开始就抗击着敌人两个旅的武装进攻。匪徒们在纵横二、三百里的地带，遍筑碉堡、分割苏区为十多个小块，进行封锁和扫荡。在苏区内，匪徒们把民众所有的房子统统烧光，把居民赶走，把粮食运出；青、壮年男子大部分在“匪民”的罪名下，被匪军杀害。配合着这一封锁，匪徒们更经常以一个团的兵力跟追工农红军游击队，并用大部分兵力不分昼夜地穿梭清剿。苏区的形势当时是相当严重的。但以周礼为首的这支小小的革命武装，在这种残酷的环境中并没有丝毫的胆怯。在敌人封锁期间，有三四个月，他们没有吃过一粒粮食，完全依靠青草和果子过活。当敌人进攻得紧急时，他们就饿着肚子几天不休息地和敌人周旋。有时实在疲乏不堪，夜里就倒在山上睡去了。有一次，敌人的搜山部队踏着他们的衣服经过，而双方都没有发觉。这种艰苦的斗争一直继续了几个月之久，整个苏区境内，最后只剩下了三个居民和一片灰烬，甚至山上的茅草都被敌人烧光，粮食要到三百里以外筹备。部队由于长期饥饿和残酷的战斗，最后仅保存了一百余人。这些钢铁炼成的勇士们，虽然处在这种史无前例的严重关头，但他们坚定不移的革命意志，和完成共产主义的崇高事业的信心，始终不渝地鼓舞着他们和敌人战斗。
    一九三五年，留守江西苏区的红军总指挥蔡会文，带了一百多人枪进入湖南和他们会合。当时由于酃遂苏区只剩下一片荒山，无再坚持的必要，遂决定向外发展，转移至桂东、上犹、崇义三角地带创造新的游击区。接着便成立了湘赣边区支队，由蔡会文任总指挥，周礼任政治委员，下分五六个大队，但总人数只有三百人，一百六十多枝枪。部队到达新的地区后，立即派出了十几个工作团，到处发动群众，组织贫农团，开辟了九百里地的工作，半年之后，就打开了一个新的局面。当敌人再度开始进攻时，就遭受了红军严重的打击，敌人一个整营被我消灭。这就立即引起敌人注意，他们组织了粤赣湘三省的兵力对红军实行“围剿”。一九三五年四月，我湘赣边区支队部二十余人，被包围于桂东之西面山。在敌人强烈的火网下，蔡会文司令率众拼死力战，最后为掩护其他同志突围，竟不幸身受重伤倒地被俘。当时敌人曾企图用担架将他抬走，但蔡会文同志却坚持不走，骂不绝口，结果被敌人当场杀害。惨无人道的敌人临走时并带走了他的头颅。蔡会文同志在死前半个月，就再没有吃过一粒粮食，他是忍着无情的饥饿装着满肚子的草根树皮，为革命战死的。他的精神永垂不朽。
    湘赣边区红军经过这一次挫折后，损失相当严重。以后周礼同志收集仅存的一百六十余人转入八面山中，休整了半年，敌人又发动进攻，这时红军接受过去的经验，再不坚守一个地区，为了保存革命力量，他们退走茶陵。在敌人连续不断进攻中，他们如蛟龙入海纵横十余县，有粮食，有群众，不仅没有受到损失，反而慢慢地发展壮大。一九三六年红军发展到两个营，达一千余人。直到一九三七年抗日战争爆发，他们才和党中央取得联系，并遵照中共中央的命令，于同年十月五日走下八面山，把这股百练成钢的革命武装，编入了新四军的部队，走上了抗日的前线。
    抗战期间，中共湖南地下党又在周礼同志的领导下，进行抗日活动。一九三九年党在湖南各县已发展到五六千人，在群众抗日活动中，起着决定的作用。国民党匪帮就在这一年对我地下党又开始了大规模的屠杀。“平江惨案”我新四军留守处十几个干部惨遭杀害，同时，在平江的红军家属及其他革命分子被杀者不下千余人，其中有一红军家属兄弟八人竟被杀掉六个。而这些仅仅是反革命刽子手们阴谋计划的开始。接着一九四一年便爆发了震动中外的皖南事变，反革命的白色恐怖一时笼罩全国，湖南中共地下党在这种情况下更遭受了反革命疯狂的逮捕和屠杀，全省组织受到空前的大破坏。在这次屠杀中，野兽一样的国民党匪帮只要一发现革命分子或其嫌疑者，一杀就是全家，甚至亲族都要连同受诛。酃县中共县委邝光前被捕后，曾被敌人用一根铁丝穿过两耳，强迫其步行，然后以煤油灌顶活活烧死。醴陵一游击队员被捉，结果全家老少一齐被害。据统计这一时期内，中国共产党地下党员在长沙被杀害者共六十人，湘潭三十余人，而在酃县、桂东、安仁等十余县内，总数不下数百人。后来为着保存力量，湖南地下党曾决定大撤退的方针，把大批党员干部送入新四军去，最后留下的只有十五个党员和两个干部，而周礼就是其中的一个。从一九四零年至一九四四年，在这一漫长的时间内，湖南地下党一直是在隐蔽待机，积蓄力量。虽然险恶的敌人不允许他们有任何活动，但他们却始终坚贞不屈地坚守着自己的岗位。一九四四年日寇发动大规模的进攻，湖南大部沦陷，周礼同志才又回到湘潭，发动群众进行敌后抗日工作。当时，周礼同志领导着几个党员到处访问群众，宣讲中国共产党在敌后的抗日故事，发动群众进行反日反特务斗争。在党的领导下很快地成立起许多抗日游击小组，总数约四百多人。在抗日斗争中，党更发展了三百八十多名党员，半年之后又重新打开了一个相当的局面。
    一九四五年，王震将军的南下部队路经湘潭，地下党和抗日游击队象迎接自己的亲人一样，和他们举行了胜利的会师，并发动了热烈的慰问，使孤军深入华南一路辛苦作战的部队，象进入自己的根据地一样获得了七天安定的休息。以后王震将军南下广东时曾留下一个支队，配合他们打击敌人，开展工作，对地下党的发展壮大起了很大的作用。抗战胜利初期，湖南地下党的工作方针是：一面在农村发动减租运动，一面根据形势的发展逐渐加强城市工作。为此周礼同志亲自领导长沙的工作，首先在长沙新闻界和学生界进行工作，接着便深入到工人、职员和一些下层群众中去，三个月的时间，发展了一百三十个党员。初步展开了反对内战、要求民主的群众运动。
    一九四六年四月，当全国反共浪潮高涨的时候，湖南反革命当局也开始了对地下党的进步分子的迫害，镇压人民群众的爱国民主运动。同年七月全面内战爆发，国民党匪帮在湖南又开始了一次大规模的屠杀。当时中国共产党的地下党员和进步分子在党的指示下大批出走隐蔽，最后只剩下了几个党员坚持工作。这中间我们不少优秀的同志被杀害了，其中最主要的如肃伯鳌同志被活埋于长沙，胡友生同志牺牲于湘潭。
    以后，国民党在湖南大肆抓丁征粮，扩大内战，再加上对人民爱国民主运动的疯狂镇压，中国共产党的湖南地下组织即进一步领导群众，广泛展开反内战、反征丁、反征粮、反征工的斗争，获得了各地人民群众的热烈支持，党的组织又逐渐地由小变大，由学校而工厂，一直深入到各个阶层。一九四七年夏，长沙、岳阳等地学生响应上海学生的反内战反饥饿运动，举行了几次大规模的游行示威，初步掀起了群众的革命高潮。接着，工人、职员的加薪运动，公教人员的改善待遇运动，都接踵而来，党的各地组织不仅完全恢复，且发展到两千余人。
    这时，由于人民解放战争不断地胜利，国民党反动匪帮在政治、经济上的迅速崩溃，群众的革命热潮高涨，形势发生剧变。加之白崇禧匪帮在湖南疯狂掠夺，更引起了群众“反匪驱桂”的更加剧烈的战斗。湖南地下党为了迎接这一革命的高潮，立即采取了放手发展的方针，党员数目增加到九千余人。仅长沙一地即达九百九十余人，大多数群众组织已完全在中国共产党领导之下，千千万万的群众都自动站到革命这边来。这种空前壮大的力量，使地下党在这一时期内，能够配合着我人民解放军的胜利前进，完全主动地有计划地进行，直到胜利地争取了程潜、陈明仁两将军的起义及湖南的和平解放。他们的努力和功绩是不可忽视的。
    湖南地下党就是在这样一条崎岖曲折的道路上坚持过来的。二十年是一个不短的时间，他们在与敌人残酷的斗争中，跌倒了又爬起来，为着中国人民的解放，艰苦卓绝，牺牲奋斗，终于坚持到胜利。在这英勇不屈的二十年中，他们不仅扩大了党的影响，发展了党的力量，组织了各个阶层的群众，而且培养了一批优秀的干部，给今后党在湖南的工作以极大的帮助，正象中共湖南省委王首道同志在八月二十五日的会师大会所说的：“湖南地下党周礼等同志坚持工作，二十年如一日，是我党的光荣，他们的精神是值得全党学习的。”
