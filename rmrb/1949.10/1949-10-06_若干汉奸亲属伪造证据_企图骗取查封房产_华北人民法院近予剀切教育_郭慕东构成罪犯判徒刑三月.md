[Beijing News] The North China People's Court has received a batch of petitions requesting the return of certain confiscated properties of traitors. After investigation, it was found that some relatives of traitors used cunning means to fabricate evidence in an attempt to illegally obtain the properties. To educate them on this illegal behavior, the court convened them on the morning of September 30th. President Chen Jinkun and Presiding Judge Jia Qian earnestly explained that under the new people's regime, everyone should be honest and abide by laws and regulations, to be a good citizen. They should never again engage in speculation, attempt illegal activities, or even try to deceive the People's Government, which is wrong. All those who have fabricated false evidence to request the return of property should promptly withdraw their applications. The government will not hold them accountable for past actions. However, if they continue to deceive the government, obstruct public duties, and fail to be reformed through education, they will be punished. The court also read out six typical cases of fabricated evidence. For example, the property at No. 10 Haibeisi Street, Xuanwai, belonging to the traitor Wang Ji@, had been confiscated by the former pseudo-Hebei High Court. Now, Guo Mudong filed a petition claiming that the property belonged to Tao Yitang, requesting its return, and submitted photos of the ownership certificate, Tao Yitang's letter of authorization, and private seals as evidence. At the same time, Wang Ji@'s wife, Tao Junong, also argued that the property was purchased by her husband with Tao Yitang's funds on his behalf, because Tao himself had been in Tongliao for ten years without any news. They were relatives, so they lived there without renting it out. However, after investigation by the People's Court, it was found that the documents were all fabricated by Guo Mudong in collusion with the traitor's family. The court found Guo Mudong guilty of deceiving the government and attempting to conceal the property of a traitor, and sentenced him to three months of imprisonment.

　　若干汉奸亲属伪造证据
    企图骗取查封房产
    华北人民法院近予剀切教育
    郭慕东构成罪犯判徒刑三月
    【京市讯】华北人民法院曾接到一批对某些早已查封之汉奸房产声请发还的呈状，经过调查，其中有汉奸亲属以狡诈手段，伪造证据，企图骗取房产。此种不法行为，该院为对其加以教育，特于九月三十日上午召集他们，由陈瑾昆院长及贾潜审判长剀切说明在新的人民政权之下，每一个人都应该老老实实，遵守法纪，做一个良好的公民，绝不应再投机取巧，意图不法，甚至想蒙蔽人民政府，这是错误的。凡是捏造假证据声请发还房产者，应从速自动撤回声请，政府既往不咎，如再继续欺蒙政府，妨害公务，教育不改，就要办罪。该院并宣读了六件伪造证据典型案件。如汉奸汪济＠宣外海北寺街十号房产一所，前已由伪河北高等法院查封，今有郭慕东出名具状诡称该房产为陶怡堂所有，声请发还，并提出所有权状照片、陶怡堂之委托信及私章等件为证，同时汪济＠妻陶菊侬亦辩称该房产系伊夫用陶怡堂之款代其购置，因陶本人去通辽十年从无音信，他们是亲戚，所以由他们不出租居住。但经人民法院查明证件均为郭慕东勾结汉奸家属所伪造者。法院以郭慕东欺骗政府，企图隐匿汉奸财产，构成罪犯，特予以判处徒刑三个月之刑事处分。
