Comrades,

I would like to share some thoughts here, among this group of literary and art workers, regarding the fate of Soviet writers and their position in the lives of the people within Soviet society. I will also attempt to compare this fate and position in the people's lives with the fate of writers in capitalist societies and their position in those societies.

I do not intend to discuss my own writing career here. I believe it would be more meaningful to address general questions about the shared destiny of writers in socialist and capitalist societies, thus addressing issues that arouse not narrow personal interest but rather fundamental, principled interest.

I will state in advance that I do not intend to deliver a report; I simply wish to share some thoughts, as a comrade, that have stirred a writer such as myself.

Needless to say, to discuss the status of Soviet writers in Soviet society, it is not necessary to cite the work of literary figures in capitalist societies as comparative material. However, because I have traveled to many places and observed many things, I have gathered comparative material, and I would therefore like to discuss the issue from this angle.

Let us begin with the feeling of loneliness. In its broadest sense, this feeling has always been, and remains, a necessary characteristic of writers in capitalist societies.

This is no ordinary loneliness, but a double loneliness: the loneliness inherent in all people living under conditions of individualism and selfishness, coupled with the unique loneliness of a writer contemplating alone at his desk while working.

This loneliness is such a common and prevalent social misfortune that, frankly, bourgeois writers sometimes fail to notice it. When people point out this loneliness to them, they rush to replace "loneliness" with terms like "individuality" or "independence," as if "independence" grants the right to be lonely, as if living in solitude is a happiness that must be maintained, and as if society's cold indifference to an individual's fate is precisely what humanity has strived for throughout its history.

We will discuss independence separately later. For now, let us only discuss loneliness. We Soviet people are fortunate enough to no longer be accustomed to a situation where society can be indifferent to people's endeavors, and where artists can fail to feel themselves as indispensable members of society; it takes living under the conditions of the capitalist world for a while to feel this unfamiliarity.

We have become accustomed to receiving many notes during evening events, asking questions like: What does this person do? What has this person written? Why is this person silent? As we answer these notes, we often fail to realize that they are telling us what a great happiness it is to be free from the centuries-old loneliness of writers. The readers, that is, the people, regard us as their own. They love us, praise us, and become angry at our setbacks. When I am silent, they worry; they also criticize our failures. But we feel the same way about them. We belong to them; we are part of the people. Under the conditions where the people, for the first time in human history, feel themselves to be an indivisible whole, we are precisely a part of this whole.

People have various emotions, which make them feel happy at times and unhappy at others. But there is one emotion that can determine whether people are happy or unhappy in the most essential parts of their lives. This is the feeling of being needed or not being needed by others. Soviet writers deeply experience the power of this feeling of being needed, and the highest meaning of "needed" is being needed by the people.

It is precisely this emotion, which we possess, that modern writers in capitalist societies lack. Here, I would like to turn to the question of the writer's dependence and independence.

This second question is closely related to the first. In fact, what constitutes dependence and independence when applied to the fate and work of a writer in our socialist society? Do we have dependence for writers here?

Of course, we do. The people, as masters of everything in a socialist country, are naturally the masters of literature as well. The people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, have become a people with high and advanced culture. They make demands on their literature that conform to their own interests, and Soviet writers should obey these demands.

The people, who have embarked on the road of building a communist society, make a simple demand on their literature: to help them build this society and to fight against everything that hinders this construction.

And this demand, which our literature openly and unconditionally obeys, opens up a vast field of activity for literature. Our literature, which safeguards the interests of the people, can freely educate the people, look forward to the future of the people, and can freely, ruthlessly, and endlessly criticize everything that lags behind on the road to this future, and everything that hinders the development of the people and the nation on the road to communism.

Literature that serves the interests of the people consciously struggles against all regressive phenomena and phenomena that attempt to turn back the wheel of history. Naturally, people's literature also fights against these phenomena within literature. Therefore, all stubborn, backward, and anti-people phenomena are met with relentless criticism and exposure by literary figures who consciously and firmly serve the people.

Soviet writers are subordinate to their social ideals, subordinate to their determination to serve the cause of the people. And due to this noble spirit of subordination, Soviet writers wage a struggle within themselves, in their own creations, against their own shortcomings and the remnants of capitalism in their consciousness. They consciously and purposefully organize and conduct their work so that the main, just, and advanced things can prevail over the secondary, accidental, and backward things in literature. The consistent internal subordination of the writer to the people and the people's cause is manifested here; this subordination not only impoverishes and diminishes the writer, but enriches him, enabling him to crystallize the most important and valuable things in his creation.

This is precisely the dependence of literature and the dependence of writers in our society. This dependence of the writer is combined with a complete independence from everything that writers in capitalist societies are boundlessly subordinate to. Soviet writers are not subordinate to commercial speculative desires, individual tastes of publishers, advertisements, the book market, and the gains and losses arising from the number of copies sold.

If we raise this question of dependence and independence before modern bourgeois literature, especially American literature, then a sad picture will be presented before us: that literature is firmly subordinate to money, money, and more money. In countries where reactionaries are in power, the writer's independence ultimately only amounts to being able to write books that are somewhat "left-leaning," which criticize certain facilities of capitalist society in a more or less restrained form, naturally without overthrowing the foundations of this society.

I have specifically used the word "writing" because, even this limited independence, basically, stops at the word writing. As for replacing the word "writing" with so-called "printing," so-called "mass publication," so-called "achieving great success," and even so-called "gaining universal fame," then the concept of independence will sharply shrink geometrically, while the concept of dependence will increase at the same rate.

The writer in capitalist society first has to rely on the publisher, but that is not enough. He also has to rely on book clubs that promote books, rely on advertisements, rely on book-selling companies, rely on newspapers and magazines that review books (or deliberately remain silent about them). That is to say, all these individual subordinations will ultimately become a complete and systematic subordination, which is the subordination to the interests of the ruling class in capitalist society.

Of course, this subordination is nothing new to artists living in capitalist countries. It does not suddenly appear after he has finished his work, but has already appeared in his spirit as soon as he sits at his desk. This subordination not only determines the fate of the works that have already been written, but often determines, with its own pressure, how a book will be written.

Many writers living under the conditions of capitalist society, even the most talented and progressive writers, also have a great feeling of self-deception. I would like to say a few words about this feeling. They fairly feel that they are excellent writers in a certain country, and from this point of view, they believe that they represent the literature of their country with their names. On the one hand, of course, this is true; it is their names that are left in literary history. However, on the other hand, a very strange phenomenon arises, a phenomenon that has been completely eliminated in our Soviet society, a phenomenon that most readers read not the works of writers whose names will be left in literary history. They read the works of lowly, third-rate, vulgar, and shameful representatives of literature. It is precisely this vulgar literature that becomes mass reading material in capitalist societies.

The Soviet Union is not the only country that has almost no illiteracy and implements universal compulsory education. However, in those capitalist countries that also implement universal compulsory education, people are trapped in the sewage of third-rate literature due to the "ideological" processing of the capitalist system and social consciousness.

Here, people are literate, one hundred percent so, in order to read classical and modern truly artistic literature, while in those countries, seventy-five out of every hundred people who are literate (I am being very conservative with the percentage) read vulgar works for the rest of their lives. I am not talking about school courses; school courses all over the world have classical works. I am talking about what people read after they leave school, what they read on their own for the rest of their lives after they leave school.

In capitalist countries, are there books written for the people, about the people, and for the people? Of course, there are. Such books appear occasionally in one country or another. But are these books the most popular reading material? Do these books occupy a major position on the bookshelves of bookstores and in the bookshelves of readers? Do people read them at home, at work, in the subway, and on trains? No! The vast majority of literary works that appear in capitalist countries are written against the interests of the people. Because modern detective novels, apart from their stupidity, are literary works against the people.

This is a question worth thinking about, so that we can understand what a principled, solemn, and important position Soviet literature is in. There, a work written for the interests of the people, for the people, enjoys the most favorable conditions after meeting the people, conditions that have nothing to do with dirty monetary calculations, detective fights, and the monopolistic oppression of reactionary publishing companies.

The position of the writer in Soviet society is that of a person who bears the mission of educating his readers, first of all, of educating young people. Precisely for this reason, we believe that no kind of vulgar literature can exist here at all. We strive to ensure that all the people, that all people, receive a correct and good education from a young age, an education that instills loyalty to the noblest ideals. Therefore, we believe that only literature that educates the people to serve these lofty ideals has the right to exist here, and no other literature.

Of course, we have writers who are more talented and writers who are less talented, works that are successful and works that the authors consider unsuccessful, but we do not have, and cannot have, vulgar writers who specialize in creating low-grade, vulgar literature. That is to say, we just do not have those writers whose works ninety percent (if not more) of are making the people dull and poisoning the consciousness of the people, and it is precisely these works that fill the bookstores of America.

Therefore, Soviet writers do not rely on the needs of bookstores artificially created by reactionaries and capitalists. In our country, they rely on the real cultural demands of the people. It is precisely this subordination that eliminates the possibility of vulgar literature existing here.

Now I would also like to talk about a form of dependence of literature on the interests of the people. The national character and mass character of literature, as well as the fact that it is disseminated among all the people, are reflected in the aesthetic features of literature. The mass character of this literature unconditionally brings new aesthetic standards to literature itself, making writers who understand these standards re-examine many things in the old aesthetic categories.

Under the conditions of socialist society, a work that safeguards the interests of the people enjoys the objective possibility of gaining a wide readership.

Under the conditions where books are written for the entire society and, in principle and ideologically, can be read by the entire society, is not the popularity of this book itself a kind of artistic standard? To create artistic works—novels, novellas, poems—that can move a part of the highly educated members of our society—university professors—and another part of our society—lathe workers in factories who have graduated from middle school—to the same extent, is not the ability to create these works not only a manifestation of the writer's ideological achievements, but also a manifestation of his artistic achievements?

Therefore, when we criticize works that are incomprehensible to the broad Soviet readership based on this, we are commenting on them not only from the ideological shortcomings of these works, but also from their artistic inferiority. Because, in our view, only those works that are both pleasing to the broad masses and equally interesting to the most educated and most cultured representatives of the intelligentsia are examples of the highest artistic skill.

Our readers, from young to old, are educated and influenced by our literature, but this situation also influences literature itself in the same way in reverse. Here, it is not only the writer who influences the reader, but also the reader who, over the past thirty years since the revolution, has new requirements for literature and actively influences the writer with these requirements and with their attitude towards literature.

A writer is often a traveler, and his writings are often the results of his life's journey. But whether the results of the journey are good or bad depends on the nature of the journey.

What kind of person is a traveler? Is a person who travels around the world according to the itinerary of the Cook company, changing from a downstream cruise ship to a first-class train, from a first-class train compartment to a bus, from a bus to a hotel, and from a hotel to the cabin of another cruise ship, is this kind of person considered a traveler?

Or is it the person who crosses uncultivated land for the first time and fills in the blank spots on the map that counts as a traveler?

I think it is difficult to equate these two kinds of travelers with these two kinds of trips.

At present, I think that most of the vulgar and reactionary bourgeois literature are the first kind of travelers, that is, the kind of travelers who hold a ready-made travel guide and travel around the world according to the Cook company's itinerary.

And Soviet literature is the second kind of traveler, that is, the traveler who discovers new continents and fills in the blank spots on the map of the human mind. Everything is new in this "unaccustomed land" described by our literature: new social principles, new standards for evaluating people, new understandings of social obligations and private obligations, new morality, new attitudes towards money, life welfare, human dignity, and the purpose of life.

No matter how brilliant the masterpieces of classical literature have shone for us, now, we still have to say our new words, words that no one has ever said before.

But you should know that we are also doing things that no one has ever done before, just like the people. Soviet literature is using all means to complete the social tasks placed before the entire people.

This certainly does not mean that we have forgotten private matters, forgotten love, life, and the thousands of problems that exist in literature.

This means that no matter how many problems you have not solved, you, the Soviet writer, must first solve the primary problem, and choose a hero to write about: how this person embodies all the personalities in the new society, what he has done for this society, and why he is respected in this new society.

Only after understanding this main truth can dozens and hundreds of other equally important problems be solved correctly.

The vast majority of Soviet writers believe that literature is not an individualistic career related only to one's narrow personal literary preferences, but a collectivist career related to the tasks that the entire people have put forward to the entire literature.

Our enemies, the reactionaries, are constantly trying to accuse us Soviet writers of having little interest in aesthetic issues and formal issues, of opposing individualism, and of having no freedom of creation.

What should we answer to this? Yes, if the form makes literary works difficult for the people to understand, we do not praise this form; yes, we believe that the highest artistic form is profound, simple, and clear, which can make the writer's works become the works of the entire people.

Yes, we oppose individualism, although each of us closes the door and writes our own works alone, but we are not lonely people, our hearts are with the people, and therefore we feel that we are a part of the entire people.

Yes, our creation is subordinate, completely subordinate to the interests of the entire people and the interests of progressive humanity, and we are proud to have this subordination, because it is the highest expression of freedom, and we are unwilling to exchange it at any time, at any cost.

Dear friends, these are some of my views on the role of the writer in Soviet society that I wanted to share with everyone.

I would be very happy if some of my views were of some interest to everyone, because the question of how we serve the people is an equally important issue for cultural workers in the Soviet Union and cultural workers in the new China of people's democracy.

### 全国文联千余人大会上　西蒙诺夫讲演词全文

　　全国文联千余人大会上
    西蒙诺夫讲演词全文亲爱的同志们：
    我想在这里，在文艺工作者的团体中间，就苏联作家的命运与苏联作家在国内生活和人民生活中的地位，讲几点意见，并试图把这种命运和这种在人民生活中的地位，跟作家在资本主义社会里的命运和他们在这个社会生活中的地位，比较一下。
    我不打算在这里讲我自己本人的作家生涯。我想，如果我讲一些有关社会主义社会和资本主义社会的作家的共同命运的一般问题，因而就是讲一些不是引起狭隘地个人兴趣，而是引起原则性的兴趣的问题的话，那是一定会更有意味的。
    预先声明，我并不打算作报告，我只是想作为一个同志来告诉你们一些曾激动了我这样一个作家的一些念头。
    不用说，要讲苏维埃社会中苏联作家底地位，是不必引用资本主义社会中文学家的工作，作为对比材料。不过，因为我曾经游历许多地方，观察过许多东西，因此就有了对比的材料，所以我想在这一方面来谈谈这个问题。
    让我们从孤独感谈起吧。就这个字的广意来讲，这种感觉在资本主义社会里自来就是而且现在也依然是作家必然具有的特征。
    这不是普通的孤独，而是一种双重的孤独，这是一切生活在个人主义自私自利的条件下的人们所固有的孤独，再加上工作的时候独自靠在书案上沉思的这样一种作家所特具的孤独。
    这种孤独是这样常见的和这样流行的社会的不幸，老实说使得资产阶级作家有时竟不注意它了。当人们向他们指出这种孤独的时候，他们就赶紧努力用“个性”或“独立性”的字样来代替“孤独”，好象“独立性”就是使人有孤独的权利似的，好象独居一室是必须维护的一种幸福似的，而且好象社会对于一个人命运的冷酷无情，就正是人类在他们整个历史中所努力追求的东西似的。
    关于独立性，我们以后再单独地谈。现在只谈谈孤独。我们苏联人很荣幸地已经不习惯于这样的一种情形：就是一方面，社会可以对人们的事业冷淡，而另一方面，艺术家也可以不感觉到自己是社会中必不可缺的一分子；这个要他们在资本主义世界的条件下生活一个时候，才会感觉到这种不习惯。
    我们已经习惯于在晚会上收到很多的条子，写这样一些问题：这个人做什么？这个人写过什么？这个人为什么沉默？我们在回答这些条子的时候，常常不想到他们在向我们讲：摆脱了几世纪来的作家底孤独是多末大的幸福。读者，也就是说人民，把我们看作是他们自己的人，他们喜爱我们，赞美我们，为我们底挫折而生气，当我沉默的时候，他们却又耽心；他们也责备我们底失败。但是我们对他们也是这样，我们是属于他们的，我们是人民底一部分；在人类历史上人民第一次感到自己是一个不可分割的整体的条件下，我们就正是这个整体的一部分。
    人们有各种不同的情感，这些情感使他们有时感到幸福，有时感到不幸。但是有一种感情，能够决定人们在他们一生最主要的生活中是幸福的还是不幸的。这就是自己为别人所需要或者是不为别人所需要的一种感情。而苏联作家就高度地体验到本身为人所需要的这样一种幸福的感觉底力量，而所谓需要，它的最高意义，就是为人民所需要。
    而现代资本主义社会的作家们就正缺乏如同我们所具有的那样的感情，这里我想转而谈到作家的从属性和独立性的问题。
    这第二个问题是和第一个问题密切相联的。实际上，在我们社会主义的社会里，应用到作家底命运和工作上的从属性和独立性是什么呢？在我们那里有没有作家底从属性呢？
    当然是有的，人民，在社会主义国家里是一切的主人，当然也是文学底主人；人民，在共产党领导下成为有高等先进文化的人民，他们向自己的文学提出了符合于自己利益的要求，而苏维埃作家就应该服从这些要求。
    已经踏上共产主义社会建设道路的人民，向自己的文学提出了一个简单的要求——就是帮助他们建设这个社会，并和一切阻挠这种建设的一切进行斗争。
    而这一个为我们文学所公开并无条件地服从的要求，给文学开辟了广大的活动园地，我们的文学，是保卫人民利益的，就可以自由地教育人民，展望人民的未来，就可以自由地无情而无限地批判在这个未来底道路上停留不进的一切，批判在通往共产主义的道路上妨碍人民、国家发展的一切。
    为人民利益服务的文学，自觉的和一切后退的、想使历史车轮倒转的现象作斗争。自然，人民文学在文学内部也和这种现象作斗争。所以一切顽固不化的、落后的和反人民的现象在我们文学内部都遭到了自觉而坚定不移地为人民服务的文学家底无情的批判和揭露。
    苏联作家从属于自己的社会理想，从属于自己为人民事业服务的决心，并且由于这种高尚的从属的精神，苏联作家在自身，在自己的创作里跟自己的缺点跟自己意识中的资本主义残余进行斗争。他自觉地有目的地组织并进行自己的工作，以使得主要的，正义的，先进的事物能在文学中战胜次要的，偶然的，落后的事物。作家对于人民和人民事业的一贯的内心的从属性，就表现在这里；这种从属性不但没有使作家贫乏和渺小，反而使他丰富起来，使他能够把最主要的和最有价值的东西结晶在他的创作里。
    在我们社会里文学底从属性和作家底从属性就正是这样。作家的这种从属性是和他那不依存于资本主义社会作家所无限制服从的一切事物的完全的独立性，结合在一起的。苏联作家与商业投机的愿望，与出版家个人的口味，与广告，与书籍市场，以及与那因为出售册数的多少而产生的赢亏不发生关系的，他是不从属于这些东西的。
    如果我们把这个从属性和独立性的问题提到近代资产阶级文学，首先提到美国文学的面前，那么，在我们面前便会呈现出这样一幅可悲的画图：就是文学确定不移地从属于金钱，金钱，还是金钱。拿反动派当权的国家来说，那里作家底独立性归根结蒂只是能够写作一些多少“左”的书籍，这些书籍以一种或多或少受抑制的形式来批判资本主义社会底某一个设施，自然不言而喻，这同时是不推翻这个社会的基础的。
    我特别用了“写作”这个字是因为，即使这种有限的独立性，基本上也还是止于写作二字而已。至于代替所谓“写作”的字样而提到所谓“印刷”，所谓“大量出版”，所谓“获得巨大的成就”，乃至所谓“获得普遍的声誉”等等的话，那末独立性底概念就将急骤地几何级数地缩减，而从属性底概念却将以同样的速度增大起来。
    资本主义社会的作家首先要依靠于出版家，但这还不够，另外还得依靠传播书籍的俱乐部，依靠广告，依靠贩卖书籍的公司，依靠评论书籍（或者故意对它默不作声）的报章杂志。这就是说，所有这些个别的从属性，终究要变成一个完全的有系统的从属性，那就是对于资本主义社会统治阶级的利益的从属性。
    当然这种从属性，对于生活在资本主义国家里的艺术家来说，并不是什么新奇的东西，它并不是在他写完了作品之后才突然出现的，而是早在他坐上写字台的时候就已经在他的精神上出现了，这种从属性不仅决定着已经写好的作品底命运，而且常常以自己的压力决定着：一本书将怎样写成。
    许多生活在资本主义社会条件下的作家，甚至最有天才和最先进的作家，也都存在着极大的自我欺瞒的感情，我想就这种感情说几句话。他们公平地感到自己是某一个国家的优秀作家，而就是从这一观点出发，他们认为正是他们以自己的名字代表着本国的文学。从一方面说，自然，这是对的，在文学史上留下的正是他们的名字，然而，从另一方面来说，就产生了一种极奇怪的现象，这种现象是在我们苏维埃社会里是完全被消灭了的，这种现象就是大多数读者们所读的并不是那些将在文学史上留下芳名的作家的作品。他们读的是低级的三等的庸俗的文学可耻的代表们的作品，恰恰是这种庸俗的文学在资本主义社会里成为群众性的读物。
    苏联并不是唯一几乎没有文盲和施行普遍义务教育的国家，然而，在那些也实行普遍义务教育的资本主义国家里由于资本主义制度和社会意识底一定“思想”的加工，人们是陷在三等文学底污水里。
    我们这里，人们识字，百分之百地是为了阅读古典的和现代的真正艺术性的文学，而在那些国家里，人们识字一百个有七十五个（我说的百分数还是很客气的）是为了一生阅读下流的作品。我不是说学校里的课程，全世界学校里的课程都有古典作品，我说的是出了学校的人们所读的东西，说的是他出了学校以后一生自己所读的东西。
    在资本主义国家里，有没有给人民，关于人民和为了人民而写作的书籍呢？当然是有的，间或在这一国家，间或在那一国家出现着这种书籍，而这些书是最群众性的读物吗？这些书在书店的书架上，在读者的书橱里占有主要的地位吗？人们在家里，在工作里，在地下铁道里，在火车里阅读它们吗？没有！出现在资本主义国家里的极大多数的文学作品都是违反人民利益而写成的。因为现代的侦探小说，除开它们的愚蠢不谈，都是反对人民的文学作品。
    在这个问题上值得想一想，以便我们能够理解苏联文学是处在怎样一种原则上不同的、庄严而重要的地位。在那里一部为了人民利益、给人民而写成的著作，与人民相见后，就享有最优惠的条件，这些条件是和肮脏的金钱的算盘，侦探的斗法以及反动的出版公司的垄断压迫没有丝毫关系的。
    苏维埃社会中作家的地位——就是负有教育自己读者首先是教育青年的使命的这样一个人的地位，正因为如此，我们认为不管是怎样的一种庸俗的文学在我们这儿是根本不能存在的。我们竭力注意使全体人民，使一切人们自年轻时候起就得到正确的，良好的，灌输忠实于最高尚的理想的一种教育。所以我们认为在我们这里有权存在的只有那种教育人民为这种崇高的理想服务的文学，而不是任何别的文学。
    当然，我们有才智高些的作家，也有才智低的作家，有成功的作品，也有作者认为不成功的作品，但是我们没有，也不可能有以创作低级庸俗文学为自己专门目的的庸俗的作家。这就是说，我们正好没有那些作家，他们的作品百分之九十（假如不是更多的话）是使人民愚钝，是毒害人民的意识的，而充满了美国的书肆的就正是他们的这些作品。
    因此，苏联作家不是依靠于反动派和资本家人工造成的书肆的需要，在我们国家里他以人民真正的文化要求为依归。正是这种从属性取消了庸俗文学在我们这儿存在的可能性。
    现在我还想讲讲文学对于人民利益依从的一种形式。文学的民族性和群众性以及它在全体人民中传播的这个事实本身就反映在美学的文学的特点中。这种文学的群众性，无条件的把新的美学标准带到文学本身里来，使得懂得这些的作家重新审查许许多多旧的美学范筹里的东西。
    在社会主义社会条件下，一部维护人民利益的著作，享有获得广大的读者群众的客观可能性。
    在书籍是写给全社会，并在原则上、思想上能为全社会所阅读的条件下，这本书的通俗性本身不就是一种艺术的标准吗？创作一部艺术的作品——长篇小说，中篇小说，诗——而这些作品能在同一程度上感动我们社会中受过高等教育的一部分成员——大学教授，和我们社会上的另一部分成员——中学毕业的工厂里的旋工。——创作出这些著作的能力不就是不仅表现出作家的思想上的成就，而且也表现出他在艺术上的成就吗？
    因此，当我们根据这一点来批评为广大的苏联读者群所看不懂的作品时，我们不仅从这些作品思想上的缺点，而且也从艺术上的低劣来评论它们。因为以我们的眼光看来，只有那些既为广大群众所喜见乐闻而同时又使最有教养的，最有文化的知识界代表们也同样感到兴趣的作品，才是最高艺术技巧的范例。
    我们的读者从小到老都受着我们的文学的教育和影响，可是这种情形同样反过来也影响文学本身。在我们这儿，不光是作家影响读者，而且是革命后三十年来已经对文学有了崭新的要求的读者，以这些要求，以他们对文学的态度积极地影响着作家。
    作家，常常是个旅行者，著作，则常常是他一生旅行的成果。但旅行的成果的好坏却要看旅行的性质来决定。
    怎样的人才是旅行者呢？按照库克公司的路程表环绕全球，下游览船改乘特等火车，从特等火车的包厢到公共汽车，从公共汽车到旅馆，又从旅馆到另一艘游览船的舱房的，这样的人就算是旅行者吗？
    还是第一次穿过没有开垦过的土地，填满地图上的白点的人才算旅行者呢？
    我以为很难在这两种旅行者与这两种旅行之间划上一个等号。
    在目前，我觉得大部分下流的反动的资产阶级文学都是第一类旅行者，就是手里拿着现成的旅行指南，按照库克公司的路程表环游世界的那种旅行者。
    而苏维埃文学则是第二类旅行者，这就是发现新大陆，在人类心灵的地图上填满白点的旅行者。在我们的文学所描写的这块还“没有住惯的土地”上的一切事物都是新的：新的社会原则，新的评价人门的标尺，对于社会义务与私人义务的新的理解，新的道德，对于金钱，生活福利，对人的尊严及对人生的目的的新的态度。
    无论古典文学的杰作曾为我们发出过如何灿烂的光辉，现在，我们还是必须把自己新的话，从来没有人说过的话，说出来。
    但是要知道，我们也同人民一样是在做着在此以前从来没有人做过的事情。苏维埃文学正在用一切方法来完成那些摆在全体人民面前的社会的任务。
    这当然不是说我们忘记了私事，忘记爱情、生活，以及存在于文学中的成千的问题。
    这是说，无论你有多少问题未获解决，你，苏维埃作家，务必首先来解决首要的问题，选择一个英雄来写：这个人如何表现出正是新社会中所有的人格，他为这个社会做了些什么，他因什么而在这个新社会中受到尊重。
    只有在了解这个主要的道理以后，才能正确地解决几十个，几百个其他与此同样的问题。
    绝大多数苏维埃作家，都认为文学不是只和自己狭隘的个人文学爱好相关联的个人主义的事业，而是与全体人民向整个文学所提出的任务相关联的集体主义的事业。
    我们的敌人——反动派，时刻企图责难我们苏维埃作家，说我们对美学问题，形式问题很少兴趣，说我们反对个人主义，说我们没有创作自由。
    对于这个回答些什么呢？是的，如果形式把文学作品变得使人民难于了解，我们是不称赞这种形式的；是的，我们认为最高的艺术形式就是深刻，简单，明了，这些能使作家的著作成为全体人民的著作。
    是的，我们反对个人主义，虽然我们每人关上房门独自在写着自己的作品，但是我们不是孤独的人，我们的心和人民在一起，而因此感到自己是全民整体中的一分子。
    是的，我们的创作是有从属性的，是完全服从全民的利益与进步人类的利益的，而我们则以具有这种从属性为骄傲，因为它是自由底最高表现，而且无论什么时候，无论什么代价，我们都是不肯交换它的。
    亲爱的朋友们，这就是我想告诉大家的关于作家在苏维埃社会中的作用的一些意见。
    如果由于我们如何为人民服务这个问题是一个对苏维埃文化工作者与人民民主的新中国的文化工作者都同等重要的问题，而使我的一些意见对大家有些兴趣，那我是很高兴的。
