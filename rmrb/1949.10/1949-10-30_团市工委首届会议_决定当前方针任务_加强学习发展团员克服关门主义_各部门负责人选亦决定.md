　　[Beijing News] The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League (referred to as the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League or the Municipal Communist Youth League Committee) held its first meeting on October 25. Xu Liqun, representing the preparatory committee, reported on the basic situation of the work of the preparatory committee since its establishment, as well as the current basic guidelines and specific tasks. The report stated that there are currently 11,000 Youth League members in Beijing. The Youth League organizations have been widely established in universities, colleges, and factories with more than 200 workers, and in many units, the Youth League organizations are quite strong and powerful. The quality of Youth League members is generally good. In student work, in implementing learning tasks and transforming thinking, the Beijing Municipal Student Union jointly organized the Summer Youth Academy and the Summer Study Group for college and middle school students this summer, with more than 12,000 college and middle school students participating in the study, which achieved very good results, and basically established the idea that the student masses should follow the Communist Party forward; the work of young workers has also laid a certain foundation. The main shortcomings in the work are insufficient understanding of the Youth League's task of uniting and educating the entire young generation and the rapid progress of young people under the new situation. Therefore, there are still phenomena of closed-doorism in many aspects of the work, and the leadership of the work of young workers and the regular education of Youth League members have not been done well enough. The future work guidelines are: to continue to implement and carry out the resolutions of the First National Congress of the Communist Youth League, and to vigorously implement and carry out the resolutions of the enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, overcome closed-doorism, and strengthen contact with the broad masses. The focus of work is on factories and schools, and at present, the leadership of the work of young workers should be strengthened. The current tasks and work are: to widely publicize and study the reports of Comrades Feng Wenbin and Jiang Nanxiang in the enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League among Youth League members, to study the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; to actively develop advanced young people as Youth League members; to carry out social service activities and youth cultural, artistic, and sports activities to unite the broad masses of young people from all walks of life; to hold short-term training courses for cadres (mainly young workers at first), to prepare for the education of winter peasant cadres and student cadres; to hold youth lectures, to check the reading and distribution of Youth League newspapers and periodicals, and to compile and print youth series of books. In terms of school work, to check the implementation and deviations of learning tasks in the middle of the semester. And to study the situation of one or two important factories and the closed-doorist tendencies of factory schools. The above report was unanimously approved after discussion.
    At the meeting, the candidates for heads of various ministries and committees and the work system were also decided. The list of heads of various ministries and committees is as follows: Director of the Organization Department: Zhang Dazhong (concurrently), Deputy Director: Chen Yiru; Director of the Propaganda Department: Yao Yisha, Deputy Director: Wang Shigu; Secretary of the Youth Workers' Work Committee: Ji Zhen; Secretary of the University Work Committee: Zhang Dazhong (concurrently), Deputy Secretaries: Zhang Shuowen, Wang Hu; Secretary of the Middle School Work Committee: Du Ping, Deputy Secretaries: Zhou Guangyuan, Pan Liang; Secretary of the Suburban Work Committee: Zhang Jinlin, Deputy Secretary: Leng Lin; Secretary of the Urban Area Work Committee: Zhu Heng; Secretary of the Directly Subordinate Organs Work Committee: Xi Congzhen, Deputy Secretary: Yang Shiying; Deputy Director of the Cultural and Art Department: Lin Kai; Director of the Women's Department: Shi Dezhen; Director of the Children's Department: Niu Jingcun; Director of the Research Office: Shen Shanqi; Secretary-General: Sun Zhongming.
