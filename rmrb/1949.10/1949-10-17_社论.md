　　(I)　Sincere Friendship between the Chinese and Mongolian Peoples
　　The establishment of diplomatic relations between the Mongolian People's Republic and our country has opened a new historical page of sincere friendship and cooperation between the Chinese and Mongolian peoples. The Chinese people warmly welcome the establishment of diplomatic relations between the government of the Mongolian People's Republic and our government, considering it a symbol and gospel of the great unity of the Chinese and Mongolian peoples and all ethnic groups.
　　Before the revolution, the Mongolian People's Republic was under the tyrannical and brutal rule of foreign invaders and domestic reactionary feudal forces. The people lived a miserable life of poverty and ignorance, let alone any freedom and development of national culture. However, the Mongolian working people loved their nation and culture, and after a long and arduous struggle, with the direct influence and assistance of the great socialist country, the Soviet Union, they won the victory of the People's Revolution in 1921, laid the foundation for the Mongolian people's own state power, and opened up a broad path sufficient to fully develop Mongolian culture, science, and art.
　　In the twenty-eight years of free life and construction, the face of the Mongolian People's Republic has been completely renewed, and it has steadily reached the scale of a modern country from a state of poverty and backwardness. New industries, railway transportation, and postal and telecommunications industries are developing domestically, and the young Mongolian working class has grown and been consolidated. The Mongolian people have already escaped from a life of poverty. The land of individual farmers has increased by 50% in the last nine years, and collective farms and state farms are increasing day by day. The area of state farms has increased by 150% in nine years. As the main national economy of the Mongolian People's Republic, animal husbandry has been accelerated under the conditions of free development and the adoption of scientific methods to breed livestock. Today, the Mongolian people have acquired three times more livestock than before the revolution, and the Five-Year Plan will enable the Mongolian people to have an average of thirty-five head of livestock per person. How enviable is this rise in people's living standards! The cultural and political level of the Mongolian people has also been continuously improved, the welfare of the working people has been gradually improved, 70% of school-age children have been enrolled in school, and a large number of intellectual cadres have grown up. The Mongolian people are striding towards socialism with full confidence.
　　The path taken by the Mongolian people is exactly the path that the Chinese people are taking and will take. The Mongolian People's Republic is our close neighbor, and the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries will undoubtedly have a profound and far-reaching impact on the exchange and development of economic and cultural achievements between the two countries. In the past, due to the tyrannical rule of the Kuomintang reactionary government over the Chinese people, it refused to recognize the Mongolian People's Republic for a long time, hindering the expression of the friendly wishes of the two peoples and keeping the friendship between the two peoples in a state of isolation for a long time. However, today this shameful situation is gone forever. The reactionary rule of the Kuomintang has been destroyed, and the Chinese people, like the Mongolian people, have become the masters of their own country. In this way, the friendship between the two peoples will develop smoothly without hindrance, which is also a solid foundation for the further consolidation of the diplomatic relations between our two countries. The establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Mongolia also marks the further strengthening and consolidation of the world people's democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union, and demonstrates the enhancement of the democratic forces of the Asian people. It is of great significance for combating the provocations of war mongers and safeguarding peace in the Far East and world peace.
　　(II)　Protest Against US Imperialism's Persecution of US Communist Leaders
　　The "Federal Court" of US imperialism, according to the orders of Wall Street bosses, and through its hand-picked "jury" put forward unwarranted charges, and actually sentenced eleven US Communist leaders to ten years in prison and the maximum fine of 10,000 yuan under US law; this shameful "trial" is the most shameless of a series of crimes committed by US imperialists to provoke new wars and infringe upon the interests of their own people! It once again nakedly proves to the world that the Truman reactionary ruling clique, composed of so-called "democratic" and "republican" party thugs, is a Hitler-style fascist bandit gang.
　　The current United States has long been turned by reactionaries into a thorough fascist country full of lynching and encouraging fascist thugs to commit crimes freely. When its domestic contradictions and conflicts become increasingly acute, and it is forced to extend its tentacles of aggression to the world to avoid an economic crisis, the American Communist Party, which fights for the interests of the working people, has become the main and most powerful obstacle on its path of aggression, and the main and powerful resistor against its attacks on people's lives and freedoms. This time, the US reactionary ruling group's "trial" of the US Communist leaders is clearly a re-enactment of the "Reichstag fire" manufactured after Hitler came to power. From now on, the American people will face the same fate as Germany under the rule of Himmler's police chief. Concentration camps will be all over the country, progressive people will be massacred, and "American-style" brown shirts will appear everywhere. That tattered coat that decorates "American democracy" will be torn to shreds, and the United States will be driven into a dark and sunless situation.
　　The current world situation clearly tells us that: the new China was born in the East, the Democratic Germany stands in Europe, and the strength of the world peace and democracy camp headed by the great socialist country, the Soviet Union, is even stronger. This force is irresistible to the imperialist group. At this time, the US imperialism played its last trump card, it did not bow its head to the peace-loving people of the world, but attacked the US Communist Party and progressive people, which shows how powerless and pitiful the struggle of this largest and last bastion of capitalism, US imperialism, to save its dying fate has become!
　　Let the US imperialist war mongers clamor in their "Federal Courts," because only here is their isolated island. The American people have their own courts and laws in their hearts. In the American people's court, it will not be the US Communist Party but a small group of Wall Street war mongers and their lackeys who will be sentenced to prison! We, the people of the People's Republic of China, have long understood a truth from the crime of "the United States provides money and guns, and Chiang Kai-shek provides people to fight the Chinese people": to subdue the internal and external reactionaries, both big and small, who infringe upon the interests of the people, we must resolutely rise up, cut off their claws, and liquidate their crimes. We solemnly warn US imperialism: withdraw this shameless "verdict" and quickly confess your crimes to the people! The day when the people will liquidate your crimes is not far away!

专栏：社论

　　（一）　中蒙人民的真诚友谊　
    蒙古人民共和国与我建立外交关系，揭开了中国人民与蒙古人民真诚友谊合作的历史新页。中国人民对于蒙古人民共和国政府与我国政府的外交关系的建立，表示热烈的欢迎，认为这是中蒙两国人民和各民族人民伟大团结的标志和福音。
    蒙古人民共和国在革命前，是处在外国侵略者和国内反动封建势力专横残暴的统治之下，人民过着贫困与愚昧的悲惨生活，更谈不到任何自由与民族文化的发展。但是，蒙古劳动人民热爱自己的民族与文化，他们经过长期艰苦的奋斗。在伟大社会主义国家苏联直接影响与援助下，获得了一九二一年人民革命的胜利奠定了蒙古人民自己的国家政权，开辟了一条足以充人发展蒙古的文化、科学与艺术的广阔道路。
    在二十八年自由生活与建设过程中，蒙古人民共和国的面貌已经焕然一新，从贫穷与落后的状态稳步达到了现代国家的规模。在国内发展着新的工业，铁路运输业，邮电业，成长并巩固了年青的蒙古工人阶级。蒙古人民已经摆脱了穷困的生活，个体农民的土地最近九年间增加了百分之五十，集体农场与国家农场正日益增多，国家农场的面积九年间增加了百分之一百五十。作为蒙古人民共和国的主要国民经济的牧畜业，由于在自由发展的条件下，采用科学方法以繁殖牲畜，更得到了加速的发展。今天蒙古人民已经获得了比革命前增多三倍的牲畜，五年计划更将使蒙古人民平均每人有三十五头牲畜。这种人民生活的上升是多么值得羡慕的！蒙古人民的文化政治水平因此也日益提高，劳动的人民福利步步改善，百分之七十的学龄儿童都已入学，大批知识分子干部业已成长。蒙古人民正满怀信心地大踏步迈向社会主义。
    蒙古人民所走的道路，也正是中国人民正在走和将要走的道路。蒙古人民共和国是我国的近邻，两国邦交的建立，对于交流与发展两国经济、文化的成就，无疑具有极深广的影响。过去由于国民党反动政府对中国人民的横暴统治，长期对于蒙古人民共和国不予承认，阻挠着两国人民友好意愿的表达，使两国人民间的友谊长期处于被隔绝的状态。但是，今天这种可耻的状况已经一去不复返了，国民党反动统治已经灭亡，中国人民象蒙古人民一样，已经成为自己国家的主人。这样，两国人民间的友谊将不受阻拦地顺畅发展，这也是我两国邦交将更加巩固的坚实基础。中蒙两国邦交的建立，也标志着以苏联为首的世界人民民主阵营的进一步加强与巩固，显示亚洲人民民主力量的增强，对于打击战争贩子的挑衅，保卫远东和平及世界和平，实具有重大的意义。
　　（二）　抗议美帝迫害美共领袖
    美帝国主义的“联邦法院”，按照华尔街老板的命令，由其御用的“陪审团”提出莫须有的罪名，竟然要判处十一位美共领袖以十年徒刑和美国法律上最高限度的万元罚金；这一可耻的“审判”是美国帝国主义者为进行新战争挑拨及侵犯其本国人民利益的一系列罪行中最无耻的一项！它又一次赤裸裸地向全世界证明了由所谓“民主”“共和”为名的两党棍徒所组成的杜鲁门反动统治集团乃是希特勒式的法西斯匪帮。
    现在的美国早已被反动造成为一个充斥私刑、怂恿法西斯暴徒自由行凶的地道的法西斯国家。当它的国内矛盾冲突日益尖锐、无法逃避经济危机而被迫向世界伸出侵略魔手时，为劳动人民的利益而奋斗的美国共产党便成了它的侵略道路上最主要和最强有力的阻碍，是它进攻人民生活与自由的主要而有力的反抗者。这一次美国反动统治集团对美共领袖的“审判”显然是希特勒登台后制造的“国会纵火案”的再版。从今而后，美国人民面临的将是有如希姆莱警察总监统治下的德国的命运一样，国内遍布集中营，进步人民横遭屠杀，“美国式”的褐衫队将出现在各处，那件装饰“美国民主”的破烂外衣，将被撕得一片无存，而把美国驱逐到一个暗无天日的境地。
    当前的世界形势清楚地告诉我们：新中国在东方诞生，民主德国挺立在欧洲，以伟大的社会主义国家苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营的力量更为强大了，这个力量是帝国主义集团所不能抗拒的。在这个时候，美帝打出了它的最后的一张王牌，它不是向世界爱和平的人民低头，而是向美共及进步人民进攻，这正说明了这一资本主义的最大也是最后的堡垒美帝国主义，为了挽救它的垂死的命运所进行的挣扎已经显得多么无力，多么可怜了！
    让美帝国主义战争贩子们在它们的“联邦法院”中叫嚣吧，因为只有这里才是它们的孤岛。美国人民的心目中是有他们自己的法庭和法律的，在美国人民的法庭上，将得到判处徒刑的不是美共而是华尔街的一小撮战争贩子及其走卒们！我们中华人民共和国的人民，早已从“美国出钱出枪，蒋介石出人打中国人”的这一罪行中懂得了一个道理：要想制服侵害人民利益的内外大小反动派，必须坚决地起来，砍掉它们的爪牙，清算它们的罪行。我们正告美帝国主义：撤回你们这一个无耻的“判决”，赶快向人民认罪吧！人民清算你们罪行的日子已经不远了！。
