　　Beijing Cadres, Workers, and Students
    Launch a Russian Language Learning Craze
    Many Set Up Training Classes; Russian Compulsory for First Year of Junior High School
    [Beijing News] In order to learn from the Soviet Union's construction experience and strengthen Sino-Soviet friendship and cooperation, various organizations, factories, and schools in Beijing have recently launched a fervent movement to learn Russian. Cadres of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China took the lead in launching a Russian language learning craze, formally forming a Russian language training class on the 2nd of this month. Over two hundred people signed up to participate, divided into elementary and advanced classes, a total of four groups, with classes held in the morning and after dinner respectively. The Beijing Municipal People's Government's Education Committee has also decided to pilot Russian language training classes within units directly under the municipal government. 108 people have signed up to learn, teachers have been hired, and it has been decided that classes will begin next week. Various bureaus under the municipal government are also in the process of preparing and considering this. Units directly under the Public Security Bureau began classes at the end of September. The preparatory committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions has over a hundred cadres signed up to participate in Russian language learning and has hired teachers. They have also guaranteed to persist in studying for two hours every day. District offices and district committees of the Communist Party of China are also preparing to organize Russian language classes. The Third District and Eleventh District have already been formed, and the Sixth District will also begin classes next week.
    Workers and cadres in major factories are also actively learning Russian and preparing to organize Russian language classes. Workers at the People's Printing Factory requested the organization of Russian language classes, and the factory's Party, government, labor union, and Youth League held a joint meeting yesterday (the 12th) to discuss specific methods for organizing Russian language classes. Other organizations, such as the North China Electric Power Company, the Beijing Automobile Repair Factory, and the Directorate General of Posts, also have Russian language classes organized.
    In addition to the universities in Beijing that already have Russian departments strengthening their studies, other departments are also adding Russian language classes, with students electing to study Russian. Peking University has set up a special Russian language group to help students specialize in Russian. According to student needs, all junior high schools have stipulated Russian as a compulsory subject for the first year. For example, the first year of junior high school at schools such as the Affiliated High School of Beijing Normal University, Girls' No. 2 Middle School, and Bei Man Middle School have all added Russian language classes. The number of students in other classes who are also studying Russian has also greatly increased compared to before.
