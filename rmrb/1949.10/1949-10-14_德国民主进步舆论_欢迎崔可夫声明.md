　　German Democratic Progressive Public Opinion
    Welcomes Chuikov's Statement
    [Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 13th] TASS Berlin dispatch: Berlin's progressive newspapers welcomed the Soviet government's decision to transfer the administrative powers originally executed by the Soviet Military Administration to the Provisional Government of the German Democratic Republic. The Berliner Zeitung, in an article entitled "The Great Friend," commented on the Soviet government's decision, stating: "Nothing could illustrate the difference between the Soviet Union's and the Western countries' policies on the German question more than the vast distance between General Chuikov's statement and the occupation statutes of the Western countries, which include a long list of restrictions on German independence." The newspaper pointed out that the Soviet Union has consistently upheld the national interests of the German people at all international conferences, demanding the early conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany—something that has been rejected by the Western countries. The main principle of Soviet foreign policy is respect for national sovereignty. The newspaper continued: "If the German people are able to establish the German Democratic Republic and a sovereign and independent government today, they should thank the Soviet Union. In contrast to Adenauer—whose 'foreign policy' boils down to constantly repeating threats of war against the East—Germany will pursue a policy of peace and sincere friendship with all countries and with the Soviet Union." The Soviet Union believes in our democratic development, in our love of peace, and in our ability to once again become a full member of the world family of nations.
    Neues Deutschland said that the German people must not betray the trust placed in them, and guarantee friendship towards the "country that first recognized them as a fully grown nation, helped the German people regain their self-esteem, and paved the way for their international recognition."
    Tribune wrote: "The working people of Germany are fully aware of the special gratitude they owe to the Soviet occupation authorities for supporting their social and legal interests. Without Soviet assistance, we would not have achieved our current status, which opens up a future full of hope for happiness. Only in close connection with the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies can our people and country achieve further progress in all aspects of foreign political relations on the basis of democracy and peace."

　　德国民主进步舆论
    欢迎崔可夫声明
    【新华社北京十三日电】塔斯社柏林讯：柏林进步报纸欢迎苏联政府决定把原由苏联军政府执行之行政职权移转给德意志民主共和国临时政府。柏林日报以“伟大的友人”为题著论评论苏联政府的决定称：“没有任何东西，可以比崔可夫将军的声明与包括一长串对德国之独立的限制的西方国家的占领法规间的巨大距离，更能说明苏联与西方国家对德国问题之政策的不同了”。该报指出，苏联在一切国际会议上坚持不渝地拥护德国人民的民族利益，要求尽早缔结对德和约——这是为西方国家所拒绝的。苏联外交政策的主要原则是尊重国家主权。该报继称：“如果说德国人民今天能够建立德意志民主共和国及主权独立的政府，那末应当感谢苏联。与阿登纳——他的“外交政策”归结起来不过是不断地重复对东方的战争威胁——相反，德国将奉行对一切国家及对苏和平与衷诚友好的政策”。苏联相信我们的民主发展，相信我们的爱好和平，以及我们再度变成全世界国家大家庭中充分一员的能力。
    新报说，德国人民必须不辜负对他们所表示的信任，保证对那“首先承认他们作为一个充分成长的国家，帮助德国人民重获自尊和铺平他们获得国际承认之道路的国家”的友好。
    论坛报写道：“德国劳动人民完全知道他们对苏联占领当局支持他们的社会与法律利益而应有的特别感激。没有苏联的帮助，我们便不会获得今天的地位，这一地位展开了对幸福的将来充满希望的前途。我们的人民和国家只有在与苏联及人民民主国家密切结合中，才能在民主与和平的基础上在对外政治关系问题各方面取得进一步的进展。”
