　　Under Strong Pressure from Workers Nationwide
    Queuille Cabinet Collapses
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 7th] Paris News: The reactionary French Queuille government, attempting to sacrifice the interests of the working class to implement the devaluation of the Franc, finally collapsed under the strong resistance of the French working class. After implementing the devaluation of the Franc, the Queuille government tried to transfer the losses incurred by capitalists in the devaluation to the workers, deciding to adopt a policy of freezing wages. This reactionary measure was immediately met with strong resistance from the working class. According to the Associated Press, the French General Confederation of Labor, the most powerful workers' organization in France led by the French Communist Party, held an emergency meeting on the 3rd and issued a statement stating that this reactionary policy of the government can only arouse the indignation and fighting spirit of the working class. The statement also called on all workers' organizations to act together to resist the government's anti-persuasion policies in order to win higher wages. Even the Socialist Party's "Workers' Force" union and the People's Republican Party's "Christian Workers' League" have repeatedly stated that they are willing to act in unison with the General Confederation of Labor. According to Agence France-Presse, the central committees of the latter two trade unions decided on the morning of the 4th to hold a 24-hour warning strike to protest.
    Under these circumstances, the Socialist Party was forced to pretend to be the "defender" of workers' interests, making a show of opposing the Queuille government's wage freeze policy, thus causing disagreements within the Queuille cabinet. According to Agence France-Presse, in the Council of Ministers, the Socialist Party opposed the government's wage freeze policy, insisting on the necessity of increasing wages. According to the Associated Press, the Paris branch of the party even asked the National Committee to immediately withdraw its ministers. Under these circumstances, Queuille was forced to submit his resignation to President Auriol on the afternoon of the 5th. Auriol accepted Queuille's resignation on the 6th and will successively meet with Queuille, National Assembly Speaker Herriot, and Communist Party leaders Thorez and Duclos to discuss the formation of a new cabinet.
    Note: The Radical Party's Queuille cabinet was formed on September 11th last year, and has been in power for thirteen months.

　　在全国工人强大压力下
    法葛义内阁垮台
    【新华社北京七日电】巴黎消息：企图牺牲工人阶级利益以实行法郎贬值的法国葛义反动政府，终于在法国工人阶级的强烈反抗下垮台。葛义政府在实行法郎贬值后，力图将资本家在贬值中所招致的损失，转嫁到工人身上，决定采取冻结工资的政策。这一反动措施，立即遭到工人阶级的强力反抗。据合众社称，法共领导下的法国最强有力的工人组织——法国总工会，三日特召开紧急会议，会后发表声明称：政府这一反动政策，只能激起工人阶级的愤慨与斗志。声明并号召一切工人组织应一致行动起来，反抗政府反劝政策，以争取较高的工资。连社会党的“工人力量”工会与人民共和党的“基督教工人联盟”，也一再声称愿与总工会一致行动。据法新社称，后两工会中央委员会四日晨并决定举行二十四小时的警告罢工，以示抗议。
    在这种情况下，社会党被迫不得不装作是工人利益的“维护者”，装腔作势地反对葛义政府的冻结工资政策，因而使葛义内阁意见分歧。据法新社称，在部长会议中，社会党反对政府的冻结工资政策，坚持有增加工资的必要。甚至据合众社讯，该党巴黎支部要求全国委员会立即撤回其部长。在这种情况下，葛义被迫五日下午向总统阿里奥尔提出辞呈。阿里奥尔已于六日接受葛义辞呈，并将相继接见葛义、国民议会议长赫里欧和共产党领袖多列士与杜克洛等商组新阁事宜。
    按：激进党的葛义内阁系去年九月十一日组成，执政共十三个月。
