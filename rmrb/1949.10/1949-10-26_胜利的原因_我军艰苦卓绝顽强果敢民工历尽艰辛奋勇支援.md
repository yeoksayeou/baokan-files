　　Reasons for Victory
    Our Army's Arduous and Resolute Perseverance, and the People's Laborers' Unwavering and Courageous Support Through Hardships
    In analyzing the reasons for victory, the spokesperson specifically listed many glorious examples of troops and laborers enduring hardships, being courageous and resolute, and completing their tasks. In order to outflank and raid the enemy, in geographical conditions with high mountains, many rivers, few villages, sparse population, and dangerous roads, in the hot summer, the troops often marched one hundred thirty or forty li in one night. Soldiers carried their full equipment, some carrying cannons and heavy machine guns, often advancing on steep cliffs and precipices with slopes of about eighty degrees and no roads, grabbing small trees and vines. They rarely lived in houses, and on rainy nights they had to open their umbrellas and sleep standing up. During mountain combat, it was common for the troops not to have food, and even worse, not to have water. Even some muddy water stained with horse manure was snatched up and drunk by those in the front. Due to over-fatigue, soldiers often fell asleep and fell while marching, but immediately got up and continued to advance. In a certain battle, a certain regiment marched urgently over mountains, and more than 400 people fainted, but they still captured more than 1,000 enemies and completed their mission. It was in this tenacious and heroic bloody battle that more than 3,000 people's heroes emerged one after another. Laborers and youth service team members carried grain and ammunition, closely followed the troops over mountains and rivers, marched long distances, risked their lives to rescue in battle, and tirelessly transferred and cared for the wounded day and night, demonstrating a high degree of revolutionary enthusiasm.
    Finally, the spokesperson pointed out: Due to the successive victories of our Northwest Army, the "Two Ma" bandit troops have basically been completely eliminated. The Guanzhong expeditionary force broke through Hu bandit's Qinling defense line, opening the gateway to Hanzhong. Hu bandit is facing the fate of destruction. After this period of training, the Shaanxi Southern People's Liberation Army has become stronger in combat effectiveness and confidence in victory, and the conditions for the complete liberation of southern Shaanxi have become more mature. He called on the military and civilians of southern Shaanxi to unite more closely, work hard together in the front and rear, do various tasks well, so as to cooperate with fraternal troops to quickly liberate all the people in the to-be-liberated areas of southern Shaanxi.

　　胜利的原因　
    我军艰苦卓绝顽强果敢民工历尽艰辛奋勇支援
    在分析胜利原因中，发言人特别列举了许多部队和民工们历尽艰辛、英勇果敢、完成任务的光荣事例。为了迂回奔袭敌人，在山高、水多、村少、人稀、道路险阻的地理条件下，在炎热暑天，部队经常一夜走一百三、四十里。战士们背着全付武装，有的扛着炮和重机枪，常在倾斜八十度左右的没有道路的陡崖绝壁上抓着小树和蔓草行进。他们很少住过房子，雨夜里只好打开雨伞站着睡觉。爬山作战中，部队吃不上饭是常事，更苦的是喝不上水，就是有些沾过马粪的泥浆水，也都被走在前面的人争着喝光了。由于过度疲劳，战士们往往为在行军中瞌睡跌倒，但立刻又爬起来继续前进。某团在某次战役中翻山越岭急行军，晕倒四百多人，但仍然俘敌千余，完成任务。就在这种顽强、英勇的浴血战斗中，先后涌现了三千多名人民功臣。民工和青年服务队员们挑着粮食弹药，紧跟部队翻山涉水，长途行军，战斗中冒险抢救，昼夜不停地转运照护伤员，表现了高度的革命热情。
    最后发言人指出：由于西北我军节节胜利，二马匪军基本上已被完全消灭，关中出击部队突破胡匪秦岭防线，打开了指向汉中的门户，胡匪正面临覆灭的命运。陕南人民解放军经过了这一时期的锻炼，战斗力和胜利信心更加坚强，陕南全部解放的条件已更加成熟。他号召全陕南军民更加团结，前后方一致努力，做好各种工作，以协同兄弟部队迅速解放陕南待解放区的全体人民。
