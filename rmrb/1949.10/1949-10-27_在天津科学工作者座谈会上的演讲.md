Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 26th – The full text of the speech given by Aigelaze, Vice President of the Georgian Academy of Sciences and member of the Soviet Cultural, Artistic and Scientific Workers Delegation, at the Tianjin Science Workers' Symposium on the 23rd is as follows:

Dear friends!

Please allow me, on behalf of the broad ranks of Soviet scholars, to extend to you fraternal greetings and to celebrate the great victories achieved by the Chinese people.

The Soviet people have sent us, Soviet cultural, artistic, and scientific workers, to China to further strengthen the ties between the Chinese people and the cultural workers of all Soviet nationalities.

We have already visited many major cities in China, and we have been deeply moved by the care you have shown to the Soviet cultural workers' delegation.

In this care, we see the Chinese people's high degree of friendship and sincere feelings towards our Soviet people, our socialist motherland, our people's government, and our leader – the protector of the working people of the world, and the great Stalin, who consistently pursues a policy of peace and friendship between all nations.

I assure you that this feeling is mutual, unanimous, and shared by all of us.

The free nationalities of the Soviet Union will always regard the heroic Chinese people with affectionate respect, sympathy, and fraternal solidarity, because they are waging a sacred struggle against the imperialist bandits and the traitorous reactionaries for their national independence and for the bright future of the Chinese people.

In Tsarist Russia, there was only one comprehensive scientific research institution covering various fields of knowledge, namely the Russian Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg. During the Soviet regime, this academy was moved to Moscow and reorganized into the All-Union Academy of Sciences. It has many scientific research institutes, branches, and grassroots organizations scattered throughout the country, as well as a large-scale publishing house that publishes dozens of scientific journals, numerous books, and scientific reports. It is currently the largest comprehensive institution in the world.

In 1947, the Soviet government's Academy of Sciences was twenty times larger than before the revolution and became an association uniting hundreds of scientific institutions, research institutes, experimental stations, and experimental farms. In these scientific institutions, tens of thousands of scientific workers are successfully conducting their various research projects.

We would like to particularly point out that, in addition to expanding the activities of the All-Union Academy of Sciences, many new branches of the academy have been established in the Soviet Union, as well as academies of sciences in various constituent republics. The Georgian Republic's Academy of Sciences is one of them, and I myself am the Vice President of this academy, leading the work of the Institute of Metallurgy and Mining.

The Georgian Academy of Sciences consists of institutes of humanities, natural sciences, technical sciences, agricultural sciences, and medicine.

The Georgian Republic Academy of Sciences oversees many large museums, botanical gardens, and wildlife sanctuaries. The entire Georgian Republic Academy of Sciences includes forty scientific organizations. What I have said only concerns the situation in Georgia; naturally, the situation is the same in all socialist republics that have joined the Soviet organization.

Next, I would like to talk about the management of large-scale scientific work and the facilities of higher education institutions outside the academies.

If, in the era of Tsarist Russia before the October Revolution, there were only sixteen cities with higher education facilities, then by 1939, the number of cities with higher education facilities had reached one hundred and fifty-six. By 1946, there were already more than eight hundred universities in the Soviet Union.

From 1938 to 1947 alone, Soviet universities graduated more than 500,000 specialists, such as engineers, doctors, agronomists, and educators. These people are all working successfully on the industrial, agricultural, and cultural fronts.

In addition to attending lectures by professors or associate professors and completing laboratory and workshop work, engineering students in our country systematically practice in factories, agricultural students in collective farms and state-owned farms, and medical students in hospitals. systematic clinical practice.

In ensuring that Soviet students have the opportunity to intern in enterprises and large scientific research institutes, they far surpass capitalist countries. Because all industrial schools and enterprises in the Soviet Union belong to the socialist state, there is no sector in industry and science that needs to keep secrets from students.

The issue of self-study for university students is also given considerable attention in the Soviet Union.

The Soviet people have always taken pride in the names of great Russian scientists before the revolution, such as Lomonosov, Mendeleev, Lobachevsky, and Popov.

However, in pre-revolutionary Russia, when talking about science, it usually referred to a few individual scholars. The characteristic of Soviet science is the existence of many large-scale scientific schools, such as the Pavlov Institute of Neurophysiology, the Kurnakov Institute of Physical Chemistry, the Vernadsky Institute of Geochemistry, and others. The establishment of large-scale scientific schools in the Soviet Union has not weakened the role of individual genius and wisdom in the slightest. Talented scholars are valued more than ever before. But he is no longer a lonely individual, but a professor or the leader of a new school.

In the Soviet Union, a scholar is measured not only by his achievements in scientific research, but also by the school of young scholars he has created.

In order to train young scientific cadres, we widely adopt the postgraduate system.

As a rule, postgraduates are selected from outstanding graduates of higher education institutions. Postgraduates are required to study for three years, during which they are directly supervised by science doctors and professors. After completing their studies, postgraduates must pass a thesis examination by the academic committee to become a Master of Science.

In order to obtain a doctoral degree, Masters of Science and teaching assistants must work at the Academy of Sciences for one to three years.

Master's and doctoral thesis examinations are conducted publicly and based on equal academic ability. Many of our current scientific leaders were formerly laboratory assistants and junior assistants at scientific research institutes or universities, as well as experienced production workers.

The Great Patriotic War, 1941-1945, the great victory of the Soviet people was a great test for the Soviet people.

Soviet scientists gloriously completed all the difficult problems in the war, such as air force, optics, mechanical construction, transportation, etc.

Over the years, the training of cadres, the development of various sectors of industry, and the establishment of scientific experimental stations have brought much happiness to the Soviet people.

One of the prominent features of Soviet science is its planned nature. Not only is there a plan for how to expand the network of scientific institutions and enrich these institutions, but also the scientific concepts are planned.

Of course, some individual scientific inventions and discoveries cannot be predicted in advance. However, please agree with me that in any science, based on the understanding gained from past research, it is possible to point out the future prospects with sufficient justification.

When establishing scientific concepts in our country, its starting point is the needs of the national economy. Attention is paid not only to the problems currently facing the national economy, but also to future problems that may suit the needs of the people many years later.

The aim of Soviet scholars is to serve the people and promote socialist construction. Soviet scholars do not waste their time, labor, and state money on unprofitable, unbeneficial, and detached propositions from socialist construction.

The socialist national economic system has opened up great prospects for Soviet scientific workers. In our country, when scientific workers have new inventions or discoveries, engineers in the production sector do not have to sell their inventions in order to put them into practice, or humble themselves in order to get money from capitalists; they are only required to have a basis for putting their inventions into practice, putting their scientific suggestions into practice, and being able to contribute to the people and to joining the national economic plan. This national economic plan stipulates all the necessary policies and funds to carry out large-scale laboratory, semi-factory, and factory experiments.

The characteristic of Soviet science is the close connection between theory and practice. Our outstanding scholars, the founders of new scientific theories, have close contact with progressive figures in agriculture or industry. The friendly connection between scholars and production workers is a common and ordinary phenomenon in our country.

Soviet scholars and academic institutions systematically study the experience of countless production and agricultural forces, popularize and carefully study this experience, scientifically enrich it, and send it back to the national economy for widespread adoption.

Eleven years ago, at a reception for higher education workers held in the Kremlin, Comrade Stalin said: "For the prosperity of science, that science is one that does not detach itself from the masses, does not distance itself from the masses, but is prepared to serve the people, and is prepared to contribute all scientific achievements to the people."

These words have become the banner of Soviet scholars. In the Soviet Union, science occupies a glorious and important position. All our national economic plans are based on genuine scientific foundations, and the majority of scholars participate in the formulation of these plans on a broad scale.

In the Soviet Union, scholars study real scientific topics in industry, agriculture, and culture, actively help solve the problems of correct allocation and selection of newly established enterprises, help select, formulate, and rationally solve production technologies, and help clarify the reserves of beneficial deposits. Soviet scholars also study the organization of production and the accounting of enterprises.

Soviet scholars help increase labor productivity in enterprises and increase crop yields in agriculture, and have won the respect and love of the Soviet people.

When we mention Soviet science, we must remember that before the revolution, Russia's manufacturing industry and extractive industry greatly used foreign methods and machines. Most machines and mechanical equipment were shipped from abroad (beds, cars, telephones, electric lights, fabrics, sanitary technology, etc.), foreign paper was used for writing and printing, and even armaments and combat equipment came from abroad. Now, working in Soviet factories are Soviet lathes, running on our roads are Soviet cars, and so on. All this has become possible thanks to the growth of science guaranteed by the Communist Party's policies and supported by the entire nation.

Countless facts show that the true prosperity of science in our country has only come after the October Revolution. I think that under the people's democratic government, new prospects have unfolded before the Chinese people, proposing and implementing fearless scientific suggestions that can significantly increase material resources and improve the welfare of the great Chinese people.

Great possibilities have now opened up before the Chinese people to devote their talents and knowledge to the noble cause of serving the people. What could be more noble and glorious than benefiting the liberated motherland and people!

Let me congratulate you on your success in this regard!

　　在天津科学工作者座谈会上的演讲
    阿格拉则
    【新华社北京二十六日电】苏联文化艺术科学工作者代表团团员乔治亚科学院副院长阿格拉则二十三日在天津科学工作者座谈会上的演讲词全文如下：亲爱的朋友们！
    请允许我代表广大的苏联学者队伍，向你们致兄弟的友谊的敬礼，并庆祝中国人民所获得的巨大的胜利。
    苏联人民派我们苏联的文化、艺术、科学工作者们到中国来，是为进一步加强中国人民和苏联各民族文化工作者的联系。
    我们已经到过中国许多大城市，你们对苏联文化工作者代表们所表现的那种关心，深深地感动了我们。
    在这种关心里，我们看见了中国人民对我们苏联人民，对我们社会主义祖国，对我们人民的政府和对我们的领袖——全世界劳动人民的保护者，以及一贯执行各民族间友好和平政策的伟大的斯大林，表现了高度的友谊和真诚的感情。
    我向你们保证：这种感情是互相的，是大家一致的，是我们共同存在的。
    苏联自由的各民族，永远以亲爱的尊敬的同情心和兄弟般的团结的精神来看待英勇的中国人民，因为他们为了自己民族的独立，为了中国人民光辉的未来正在和帝国主义强盗们与卖国贼反动派进行神圣的斗争。
    在沙皇俄国，只有一所包含各种专门知识的科学研究的综合机关，就是彼得堡的俄罗斯科学研究院。在苏维埃政权时期，这所研究院移到莫斯科，改组为全苏科学研究院，它拥有许多科学研究所、分所以及散在全国的基层组织，并且还有一个大规模的出版机关，出版了几十种科学杂志、大量的书籍和科学报告，它在目前是世界上规模最大的综合机关。
    一九四七年苏联政府科学院比革命前扩大了二十倍，并且成为联合几百个科学机关、研究所、实验所和实验站的协会，在这些科学机关中，成千成万的科学工作者们顺利地进行自己的各种研究工作。
    我们在下面想特别指出，除了扩大全苏科学研究院的活动，在苏联组织许多新的科学院分院以外，还在各个加盟共和国设立科学院。乔治亚共和国的科学研究院就是其中的一个，我本人就是这个科学院里的副院长，领导冶金和矿山研究所的工作。
    乔治亚科学院由人文科学、自然科学、技术科学、农学和医学研究所组成的。
    乔治亚共和国科学院管辖着许多大型的博物馆，植物园和禁猎区。全部乔治亚共和国科学院包括了四十个科学组织。我所说的只是有关乔治亚的情形，自然，所有加入苏维埃组织的社会主义共和国的情形也是这样。
    下面我想谈进行大规模的科学工作的管理和科学院以外高级学校设备的问题。
    如果说，在十月革命前的帝俄时代，只有十六个城市有较高设备的学校，那么到一九三九年，有高级设备的学校的城市，那时的数字就达到了一百五十六。到一九四六年，在苏联已经有八百以上的大学。
    仅一九三八——四七年苏联大学就毕业了五十万以上的专家，如工程师、医生、农学家、教育家。这些人都在工业农业和文艺战线上顺利地工作着。
    我国的大学生除听教授或副教授的讲课和完成实验室以及劳作室的工作外，工科的学生要有系统地在工厂进行实习，农科学生在集体农庄和国营农庄，医科学生在医院进行有系统的临床实习工作。
    在保证苏联学生在企业和大的科学研究院获得实习机会这一点，他们是远远的超过了资本主义国家。因为苏联所有工业学校和企业都是属于社会主义国家的，因此，在工业和科学就没有任何一个部门需要对学生们保守秘密。
    大学生的自修问题在苏联也受到相当重视。
    苏联人民是一向以罗莫诺索夫，门结列夫，罗伯契夫斯基，伯伯夫等俄国革命前的伟大科学家们的名字为光荣的。
    但是，在革命前的俄国，当谈到科学的时候照例是指几个个别的学者们。苏联科学的特点是许多大规模的科学学校的存在，如巴夫洛夫神经学院，古尔那可夫理化学校，未尔那得斯基地质学校及其他。苏联大规模的科学学校的建立丝毫也没有削弱个人天才和智慧的作用。天才的学者比过去更为我们所重视。但是他现在并不是孤独的一个人，而是教授或是新学校的领导者。
    在苏联，衡量一个学者时不仅是以他对科学研究上的成就而且还要以他所创立的教育的青年学者的学校来衡量。
    为了培养青年科学干部我们广泛采取研究生制度。
    照例研究生是由高等学校的优等毕业生选出的。研究生是要经过三年学习的，这期间是受科学博士和教授的直接考察的。学习后，研究生要经过学委会的论文考试方能成为科学硕士。
    为了得到博士学位，科学硕士和助教要在科学院工作一至三年。
    硕士和博士论文考试是公开而靠平等学力进行的。现在我们很多科学领导工作者过去曾是实验室助教和科学研究院或大学的初级助手们，还有经验丰富的生产工作者。
    伟大的祖国战争，一九四一——四五年，苏联人民的伟大的胜利是对苏联人民的伟大考验。
    苏联科学家们光荣的完成了战争中的一切艰难问题，如空军、光学、机械建筑、运输等。
    几年来，由于培养干部，发展各部门工业，创立科学实验站的培养工作，给苏维埃人民带来了许多幸福。
    苏维埃科学的显著的特点之一就是它的计划性。不仅是计划如何扩充科学机关网和充实这些机关，而且科学的构想也在计划之中。
    当然，有一些个别的科学的发明和发现是不能预先猜想得到的。但是，请你们同意我的话，就是在任何的科学之中，根据对于以往研究所得的领悟，可以十分有根据地指出未来的前途。
    我国内在确立科学构想的时候，它的出发点是国民经济的需要。所注意的不仅是现时摆在国民经济面前的问题，而且也有未来的问题，这种问题可能在多年以后适合人民的需要。
    苏维埃学者的目的是服务于人民，促进社会主义建设。苏维埃学者并不是各随所好地白白地＠蹋光阴、劳力和国家的金钱，来完成没有益处的，于人没有好处的，脱离社会主义建设的命题。
    社会主义的国民经济制度对于苏联科学工作者开辟了很大的前程。在我们国家之内，有了新发明的或是新发现的科学工作者，生产部门的工程师不必为了实用他的发明而出卖他的发明或者为了向资本家讨钱而卑恭屈膝；只要求他有实用他的发明、实用他的科学建议，能够对于人民对于加入国民经济计划有所裨益的根据。这种国民经济计划规定一切必要的方策、经费来实行大规模化验所的、半工厂的和工厂的实验。
    苏维埃科学的特点是理论与实际的紧密联系。我们出色的学者，新科学理论的建立者，和农业的或是工业的进步分子发生密切联系。学者们和生产部门工作者的友谊联系在我国里面是一种常见的普通的现象。
    苏维埃学者、学术机关，有系统地研究无数生产和农业生力军队伍的经验，普及和切实研究这种经验，科学地丰富它，并将它送回到国民经济那里，以便普遍的采用。
    十一年以前在克里姆林宫举行的高等学校工作者招待会上，斯大林同志说：“为了科学的繁荣，那种科学就是不脱离群众，不远离群众，而准备服务人民，准备把一切科学成就贡献给人民的科学。”
    这些话成为苏联学者的旗帜。在苏联，科学占着光荣的和巨大的地位。所有我国的国民经济计划，都建筑在真正科学基础上，多数学者广范围地参加了制订的工作。
    在苏联，学者们研究工业上、农业上和文化上真正的科学题目，积极地帮助解决正确的配置和精选新创立的企业的问题，帮助选择、制订和合理解决生产技术，帮助阐明有益埋藏的储藏量，苏维埃学者们同样地研究组织生产问题和企业采算工作问题。
    苏维埃学者们帮助增加企业上的劳动生产率，增加农业上的收获率，获得了苏维埃人民的尊敬和爱戴。
    当我们提到苏维埃科学时，必须想到在革命前，俄国的制造工业和采取工业大大地使用了外国方法和机器，大部分机器和机械装置都是由国外运来的（床子、汽车、电话、电灯、布匹、卫生技术等），用外国纸写字和印刷，甚至武装物品和战斗器材都是来自外国。现在在苏联工厂内工作的，是苏维埃车床，在我国马路上跑的，是苏维埃汽车等等。由于共产党政策所保障的和全国人民所拥护的科学的成长，这一切都成为可能的了。
    无数的事实说明了：科学上的真正繁荣，在我国，只是在十月革命后才到来的。我想，在人民民主政府下，中国人民面前展开了新的远景，提出和实行无所恐惧的科学建议，它们能够显著地增加物质资料和提高伟大中国人民的福利。
    在中国人民面前，现在开辟了很大的可能性，来把自己的才能和知识从事于服务人民的崇高事业。还有什么能比造福于解放了的祖国和人民更崇高和光荣的呢！
    让我祝贺你们在这一方面的成功！
