Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 18th - TASS, New York: William Z. Foster, Chairman of the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA), and Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, a member of the National Committee, issued a statement on the night of the 16th, announcing that the Communist Party will continue to work as a legitimate working-class party in the United States, despite the Federal Court's ruling on the 14th that the party's General Secretary, Eugene Dennis, and ten other Communist leaders were guilty.

The statement pointed out that although the purpose of this verdict is to "outlaw the Communist Party," the Communist Party will "continue to work as usual as a working-class party, fighting for the interests of the people, and defending its own legitimacy and its right to conduct party activities." The statement declared that "the government or any court abolishing" this right "would inevitably violate the U.S. Constitution."

Foster and Flynn declared that the verdict announced last week gave "aid and comfort to the pro-fascist forces threatening peace and democracy in the United States and the world." The Communist Party will appeal the "conviction" of the eleven Communist leaders to a higher court. However, this action does not mean that the Communist Party "recognizes the court's verdict as outlawing the Communist Party." Foster and Flynn declared that the Communist Party now upholds the same propositions as it has for the past thirty years -- the principles of Marxism-Leninism and Socialism. They predicted that the majority of the American people will eventually "uphold the principles of socialism."

The Worker newspaper said in an editorial: "The Communist Party cannot be declared illegal, because it derives its right to operate from the fundamental and indispensable rights of our people, a right recognized by the U.S. Constitution itself. No verdict based on a trumped-up indictment can outlaw such a party."

　　美共主席福斯特声明
    作为美国工人阶级合法政党
  　美共决继续为人民利益而战
    【新华社北京十八日电】塔斯社纽约讯：美国共产党全国委员会主席福斯特与全国委员会委员弗林于十六日夜发表声明，宣布共产党将继续作为美国的合法的工人阶级政党而工作，尽管联邦法庭十四日的判决宣布党的总书记但尼斯及另外十位共产党领袖犯罪。
    声明指出，虽然这一判决的目的在于“使共产党成为非法”，但是，共产党将“继续照常作为工人阶级的政党而工作，为人民的利益而战，保卫其自身的合法性及其进行政党活动的权利”。声明宣称，“政府或任何法庭废除了”这一权利，“就必定违反了美国宪法”。
    福斯特与弗林宣称：上周宣布的判决，给“威胁美国及全世界的和平与民主的亲法西斯势力以援助和慰籍”，共产党将就十一位共产党领袖的“判罪”向更高的法庭提出上诉。但是，这一行动并不意味着共产党“承认法庭的判决使共产党成为非法”。福斯特与弗林宣称：共产党现在拥护的主张和过去三十年来一样——马列主义与社会主义原则。他们预言大多数美国人民终将“拥护社会主义原则”。
    工人日报在社论中说：“共产党是无法被宣布为非法的，因为它从我们人民的基本的和不可缺少的权利中得到活动的权利，这一权利是为美国宪法本身所承认的。任何以栽诬的起诉状作根据的判决，都无法使这样的政党成为非法。”
