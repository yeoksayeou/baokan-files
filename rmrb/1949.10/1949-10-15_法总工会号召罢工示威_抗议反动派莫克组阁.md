　　French General Confederation of Labor Calls for Strike Demonstrations
    Protest Reactionary Moc's Cabinet Formation
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 14th] Paris dispatch: French laboring people protest against the ruling clique's attempt to put forward the Social Party leader and former Minister of the Interior Moc, known for his anti-Soviet and anti-labor stance, to form a reactionary cabinet with the same old medicine in a new bottle. According to Agence France-Presse, the Paris District of the French General Confederation of Labor's affiliated trade unions issued a letter to all workers on the 12th, calling on workers in various regions to hold strikes and demonstrations on the afternoon of the 13th, when Moc intends to submit his program of "disaster, reaction and war" to the French National Assembly, to show their protest.
    The General Confederation of Labor also called on members of the Popular Republican Party's "Christian Workers' League" and the Social Party's "Workers' Force" trade union to unite and demand the establishment of a democratic and unified government, and to immediately give all wage earners a temporary allowance of 3,000 francs and rebuild the collective contract system. 1,500 workers in a branch of the Renault factory also announced their firm protest against Moc's organization of a new cabinet.

    【新华社北京十四日电】巴黎讯：法国劳动人民抗议统治集团企图抬出以反苏反劳工而著名的社会党党魁前内长莫克出来组织换汤不换药的反动内阁。据法新社报道，巴黎区法国总工会所属各工会十二日发表告全体工人书，号召各地工人于十三日下午当莫克拟向法国国民议会提出其“灾难、反动和战争”的纲领时举行罢工和示威，以示抗议。
    总工会并号召人民共和党的“基督教工人联盟”与社会党的“工人力量”工会会员团结一致，要求成立民主统一政府，并要求立即给一切工薪阶层三千法郎的临时补助金与重建集体合同制度。雷诺工厂一个分厂一千五百工人亦宣布坚决抗议莫克组织新阁。
