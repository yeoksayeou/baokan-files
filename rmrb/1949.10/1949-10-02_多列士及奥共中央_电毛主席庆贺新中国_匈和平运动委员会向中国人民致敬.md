    On International Peace Day, all peace-loving friends in Hungary extend their sincere respect to the broad masses of liberated people who fought for the freedom of the People's Republic of China. The Hungarian people are watching with sincere joy and great enthusiasm the heroic Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and its leader Comrade Mao Zedong, in their great and glorious struggle for liberation against enemies at home and abroad. This war of liberation has opened a new and glorious page in Chinese history. This victorious struggle is not only a great success for the Chinese people, but also a success for the entire international peace front, and it is the most serious defeat for the imperialist war instigators since the victory of World War II. This shows why the victory of the democratic forces in China marks a decisive turning point in the great struggle for democracy, freedom, national independence and peace. The People's Republic of China, closely united with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, will be a strong fortress in the anti-imperialist camp. We hope that the Chinese people will consolidate this young democratic regime and protect the national independence and freedom they have already won; and we hope that they will achieve new victories in the struggle for people's freedom and peace. Please accept the fraternal greetings and expressions of solidarity from the Hungarian people.

    The Hungarian National Committee of the Peace Movement.
