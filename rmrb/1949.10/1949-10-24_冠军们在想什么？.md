　　What Are the Champions Thinking?
　　Shi Da Communications Group
　　Since the opening of the Beijing People's Sports Conference on the 2nd, people from all walks of life, especially teachers who have been engaged in sports for many years, and people from visiting groups from various places, have expressed many valuable opinions and observations on this unprecedented and historically significant conference. Undoubtedly, the athletes who personally participated in this grand event feel even more happy and satisfied with this conference. When the students of the Shi Da Communications Group announced the results of the finals at the rostrum, they immediately interviewed several students who were listed on the list of winners.
　　The first person interviewed was Che Keying, a student from the Physical Education Department. Che is one of the participants in middle-distance races in previous sports meets for the past decade, and has won the championship many times. This time, he won the first place in the 400-meter race (scoring 52.8 seconds). When asked about his feelings about winning the championship this time, he said: "To be honest, in the past when I participated in sports meets, it was all for the sake of competing for 'first place,' and it was completely about showing off personally. Although I won first place again today, my thinking has completely changed. I think, for me personally, the important thing is how, after this conference, I should work hard for people's sports under the new democratic sports policy, so that sports can penetrate into factories, barracks, and rural areas. At that time, I will feel the most glorious." Finally, he added: "Besides myself, I am more willing to join hands with friends who are currently and will be studying sports, and work together for the people's sports."
　　The second was Xu Baochen, the champion in the high jump. He said with a smile: "My getting first place was a fluke"—he was so modest—"because in recent months, I have been helping the comrades of the People's Liberation Army in the special forces of the North China Military Region to engage in sports activities, and then I participated in the preparatory work, so it was difficult to have time to practice. In the past, in this situation, I would definitely be emotional, afraid of not being able to compete for first place; but now, I don't take this matter to heart, because I already know that it is much better to do a good job in sports for more people than for me to compete for first place alone!" When asked about his feelings about this conference, he still said with a smile: "Because the people who participated in the competition beforehand generally recognized that this was an opportunity for mutual learning and observation, the kind of jealousy, contempt, and other bad phenomena that existed between athletes in the past have not been seen from preparation to today, which is really rare and valuable."
　　Zhang Ren＠, who won first place in the women's high school group 60-meter race, said naively and enthusiastically: "Several worker comrades from the Xinhua Paper Mill kindly praised me when they knew that I had won first place. In fact, I only hope that they can get first place. In the past half a month, in contact with them—referring to the workers of Xinhua Paper Mill—I deeply saw the Kuomintang's destruction of workers' sports. It (the Kuomintang) not only did not allow workers to have sports activities, but even ignored the sanitation of workers' residences, thus fostering the neglect of sports by some workers. In the future, if I have time (like on Saturdays), I must help them do a good job in sports, and serving the workers is my supreme glory."

　　冠军们在想什么？
    师大通讯组
    北京市人民体育大会，自二日开幕以来，各界人士尤其从事体育界多年的先生及各地参观团的人士，都对这一空前的富有历史意义的大会，发表了不少的宝贵意见和观感。无疑地，亲身参加这一盛会的运动员们，对于这一个大会，更感到无限的愉快和满意。师大通讯组同学在主席台宣布了决赛结果的时候，当场就分别访问了几位被列在优胜者名单上的同学。
    首先访问的是体专二的车克英同学，车同学是近十年来历届运动会参加中距离赛跑者之一，而且是好多次获得冠军者，这次又赢得了四百米赛跑的头名（分数为五二、八秒）。当问到他对这次获得冠军的感想时，他说：“老实讲吧，以前我参加运动会，都是为了争‘第一’，完全是表现个人，出风头的想法。今天我虽然又得了第一，但是想法完全变了，我想，对我个人来说，要紧的是经过这次大会后，我该如何的在新民主主义的体育方针下为人民体育而努力，使体育深入到工厂里兵营里和农村中去，那时我才会觉到是最光荣不过的。”末了他又说：“除我自己而外，更愿与现在和未来的学体育的朋友们携起手来，共同为人民的体育而努力。”
    其次是获得跳高冠军的徐宝臣同学，他笑嘻嘻地说道：“我得第一是侥幸——他是这样的谦虚——，因为近月来，我一直在华北军区的特种兵团里帮助解放军的同志们搞体育活动，以后又参加了筹备工作，很难有时间去练习。这种情形，若在从前，那我一定是要闹情绪的，怕争不到第一；但现在，我却不把这事放在心上，因为我已知道把更多人的体育搞好，比我一个人争个第一要强得多！”问到他对这次大会的感想时，他依然是那样笑咪咪地说：“由于在事前参加竞赛的人们普遍地都认识到这是一个相互学习、相互观摩的机会，所以，过去的那种运动员之间的嫉妒，轻视和其他不好的现象，从筹备到今天还没有看见过，这真是难能而可贵的。”
    赢得女高组六十米赛跑第一名的张仁＠同学，天真而热情地说：“有好几位新华造纸厂的工人同志们，知道了我获得第一的时候，都亲切的称许我。其实，我只愿他（她）们能得到第一。半个多月以来在与他们——指新华造纸工人——的接触中，我深深地看到国民党对工人体育的摧残，它（国民党）不仅不让工人有体育活动，甚至连工人住宅的卫生理也不理，因此，养成了部分工人对体育的疏忽。今后，我有时间的话（象礼拜六）我一定要帮他们搞好体育，为工人服务是我的无上光荣”。
