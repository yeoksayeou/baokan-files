By the 18th, the received congratulatory telegrams included nearly sixty units.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 20th] Biso, the General Secretary of the French Postal Workers' Union, affiliated with the French General Confederation of Labor's National Federation of Postal, Telegraph and Telephone Workers, sent a letter on the 5th to congratulate the founding of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, stating: The French Postal Workers' Union joyfully pays tribute to the establishment of the People's Democratic China and congratulates the brave and far-sighted leaders who have led the Chinese people to overcome reactionary forces. The French postal workers see in the People's China a great force serving democracy and peace, and they also see in the People's China an example of seeking liberation from capitalism, which insults the working class and hopes to drag us into the most brutal war. At this moment, we would like to express our fraternal friendship and our admiration and congratulations to our Chinese postal worker comrades.
    Long live the People's China!
