    [Beijing News] The Beijing Huachang Military Uniform Bureau, Quanxing Grain Store, and Yu@ Grain Store, due to illegal activities such as hoarding, cornering grain purchases, and reselling gold and silver, were investigated and seized by the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce and handed over to the court for trial, as detailed in the city's newspapers on September 7th. The Beijing People's Court, in order to protect the operation of legitimate businesses, safeguard the interests of the broad masses, stabilize prices, and ban speculative merchants, has decided to impose fines on them: Huachang Military Uniform Bureau, for hoarding and disrupting the market, is fined 6 million yuan. Quanxing Grain Store, for violating government orders and scheming to corner purchases of grain from trade companies, is fined 4 million yuan. Yu@ Grain Store, for buying and selling gold and silver in violation of the ban, is fined 2 million yuan. As for the materials previously frozen from Huachang and Quanxing, considering that they are first-time offenders, they will be unfrozen and returned after the fines are paid in full.
