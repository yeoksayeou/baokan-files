　　The North China People's Government and the North China Military Region jointly issued an order to the people to immediately deploy epidemic prevention work.

　　[This newspaper reports] The North China People's Government and the North China Military Region jointly issued an order on the 29th, ordering the people's governments of all provinces and cities and the military regions of all provinces to pass on specific arrangements for the work of eliminating and preventing epidemics. The order stated:

　　Since the discovery of plague in Chahar, it has gradually spread southward, causing a number of deaths. This epidemic is extremely contagious, and the mortality rate of patients is over 90 percent. If it is allowed to develop, it will become an irreparable disaster. The military and civilians in the affected areas should immediately make the eradication of plague the top priority. Neighboring provinces such as Suiyuan, Hebei, and Shanxi, which are adjacent to the epidemic area, should also not be negligent and should take emergency precautions. Beijing and Tianjin are densely populated areas with extensive transportation networks, and great vigilance should also be raised and preventive measures taken. The following decisions are made regarding future epidemic prevention work:

　　(1) Our Central People's Government has organized the Central Epidemic Prevention Committee, with Comrade Dong Biwu as the director, directly under the jurisdiction of the Closure, Epidemic Prevention, Propaganda, and Secretariat departments, to uniformly lead the epidemic prevention work. Our provinces and cities should quickly organize epidemic prevention committees to arrange work. Military and political leaders at all levels must personally participate to strengthen leadership. The various measures already deployed in Chahar Province should be strictly checked and adhered to. Counties, districts, and villages in the epidemic area and quarantine area must also organize epidemic prevention committees. Every ten households in the village should have an epidemic prevention group leader to check and report on the health status of the people in those ten households. Quarantine stations should be set up in epidemic areas and quarantine areas, along with isolation facilities or isolation hospitals. Propaganda and education work must be strengthened and universal rat extermination, flea control, and sanitation campaigns should be conducted.

　　(2) To prevent the spread of plague, traffic closure must be implemented. This work must be enforced by mandatory means. The Ministry of Railways has ordered the cessation of traffic between Beijing-Zhangjiakou and Zhangjiakou-Datong. Highways, main roads, and pedestrian paths in and around the epidemic area must also be closed. Within the blockade line, restrictions should also be enforced between urban areas, villages, and even between sick and non-sick individuals. To carry out the closure task, the North China Military Region has issued orders with specific divisions, which are to be strictly enforced. Military health agencies should prioritize epidemic prevention work and cooperate with closure troops to undertake quarantine, vaccination, isolation, treatment, and other matters.

　　(3) Any area with plague patients must be closed for ten to fourteen days. If no new patients occur during this period, the closure can be lifted, but it must still be approved for release after inspection by epidemic prevention personnel.

　　(4) Epidemic prevention agencies at all levels should immediately report any discovery of an epidemic situation and report to the Central Epidemic Prevention Committee at any time so that it can grasp the situation and quickly deploy work. If there is any delay in reporting or concealment of the epidemic, resulting in the spread of the epidemic, severe punishment will be imposed.

　　(5) All personnel in the epidemic quarantine areas, except those permitted by doctors, must receive epidemic prevention injections and obtain an injection certificate. All suspected plague patients must be admitted to isolation facilities, and all plague patients must be admitted to infectious disease hospitals for treatment. The bodies of those who die from plague and their belongings must be cremated or buried more than seven feet deep. During the epidemic prevention period, all deaths from disease must be reported to the epidemic prevention agency, and the deceased must not be buried privately.

　　(6) All public and private health personnel in the epidemic area have the obligation to participate in epidemic prevention work during the epidemic prevention period and be subject to the dispatch of epidemic prevention committees at all levels.

　　(7) All entertainment venues in the epidemic area should be closed immediately, and no mass meetings should be held. Entertainment venues, inns, mule and horse shops, etc., in the quarantine area and the Beijing-Tianjin area should be constantly inspected and disinfected under the supervision of epidemic prevention personnel.

　　The above decisions are to be followed immediately and relayed to all subordinate governments and armies, according to the specific local conditions, detailed arrangements are of utmost importance.

　　华北人民政府暨军区联合发布命令　
    紧急布置防疫工作         
    从省市直至村街应迅即建立防疫组织加强宣传普遍进行捕鼠灭蚤清洁运动疫区周围一切道路都应强制执行封锁
    【本报讯】华北人民政府、华北军区于二十九日联合发布命令，令各省市人民政府、各省军区转令所属具体布置灭疫防疫工作。命令称：
    察北发现鼠疫以来，逐渐向南蔓延颇有死亡。此疫传染性特大，患者死亡率达百分之九十以上，如任其发展，将形成不可挽救之灾害，疫区军民应即以扑灭鼠疫为当前首要任务。邻接疫区之绥远、河北、山西等省，亦不得有所疏忽；应作紧急防范。京津地区人烟稠密，交通四达，亦当引起重大警惕，进行预防措施。对今后防疫工作特作如下决定：
    （一）我中央人民政府已组织中央防疫委员会，以董必武同志为主任，直属封锁、防疫、宣传，秘书各处，统一领导防疫工作，我各省、市应迅即组织防疫委员会，布置工作。各级军政首长必须亲自参加，加强领导。察省已布置的各项措施应严格检查坚持执行，疫区、检疫区内各县、区、村也须组织防疫委员会，村街每十家应有防疫小组长，以检查和报告该十家人员健康状况。疫区与检疫区应设检疫站，同时有隔离所，或隔离医院。并必须加强宣传教育工作并进行普遍的捕鼠灭蚤及清洁运动。
    （二）防治鼠疫蔓延须进行交通封锁，这一工作，必须以强制办法执行。中央铁道部已命令京张、张大间停止交通，在疫区及其周围的公路、大路、人行路，亦同样要封锁，在封锁线内，各城市区村间，以至病者与非病者间，亦宜进行。为执行封锁任务，华北军区已有命令具体划分，希严格执行。军队卫生机关，目前应以防疫工作为首要任务协同封锁部队担任检疫、注射、隔离、治疗等事宜。
    （三）凡发生鼠疫患者地区一律封锁十至十四日，如在此期间内未发生新患者，可以解除封锁，但仍须在防疫人员检验后认可放行。
    （四）凡发现疫情各级防疫机关应即迅速通报，并随时报告中央防委会以便掌握迅速布置工作，如有迟滞疫情隐匿不报以遭致疫情蔓延之结果，须受严厉处分。
    （五）疫区检疫区除为医生所允许者外，所有人员须受防疫注射。并领取注射证，凡疑似鼠疫患者，均须入隔离所，凡鼠疫患者皆须入传染病院治疗，凡因鼠疫而死者，尸体及其用物须焚毁，或深埋七尺以下。凡防疫期间，一切疾病死亡，皆须报告防疫机关，更不得自行掩埋死者。
    （六）凡疫区公私卫生人员在防疫期间有义务参加防疫工作，听候各级防疫委员会的调遣。
    （七）凡疫区内一切娱乐场所应即停止营业，亦不得开群众大会。检疫区及京津地区的娱乐场所、客栈、骡马大店等，应经常在防疫人员监视下，不断施行检查与消毒。
    以上决定希即遵照，并转令所属各级政府、军队，依据本地具体情况详细布置施行是属至要。
