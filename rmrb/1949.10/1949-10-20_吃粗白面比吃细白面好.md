　　Eating Coarse White Flour is Better Than Eating Fine White Flour
　　Ni Zhangqi
　　It is a well-known fact that coarse white flour (i.e., 85% extraction flour – 85 pounds of flour obtained from grinding and sifting 100 pounds of wheat) is nutritionally superior to fine white flour (i.e., 70-73% extraction high-grade white flour – 73 pounds of flour obtained from grinding and sifting 100 pounds of wheat).
　　If we can implement the substitution of "85% extraction flour" for "70-73% extraction high-grade white flour," it would be a production-increasing measure, reducing the waste of the outer layers of wheat kernels and increasing the utilization of beneficial substances. It would also benefit the health of the people. If this can be implemented nationwide, although the wheat yield would still be approximately 40 billion catties per year, the flour yield could increase by more than 4 billion catties annually. In today's urgent need to increase grain production, improving milling methods can indeed increase flour production by billions of catties.
　　In addition, there are benefits in terms of quality. For example, the amount of Vitamin B1 can be increased several times. The increase in Vitamin B1 obtained by the people each year is several times the amount contained in more than 4 billion catties of top-grade flour, which is equivalent to obtaining approximately hundreds of trillions (hundreds of thousands of billions) of international units of Vitamin B1 per year. These hundreds of trillions of units are enough to supply the annual needs of more than 200 million people to maintain health.
　　Coarse white flour also contains a lot of protein. The people can thus obtain an additional 600 million catties of protein each year, which is equivalent to more than 3 billion catties of pork. At the same time, it will also help the people obtain 100 billion milligrams of Vitamin B2, and help the people utilize approximately 10 billion milligrams of niacin annually.
　　In summary, the wheat germ and bran layers are rich in protein and vitamins. Various important beneficial substances in high-grade white flour are almost completely sifted out and lost, while in 85% extraction flour, although some of the germ and bran layers are sifted out, some remain. Therefore, although coarse flour is slightly yellow and rough, it is rich in nutrients, and although its appearance is not very white, its nutritional value far exceeds that of top-grade white flour.
　　The specific methods for promoting this plan are: (1) A relatively simple method: the government promulgates a decree stipulating that from now on, flour mills in all regions shall no longer produce flour finer than 85% extraction, and the standard for the whitest product shall be 85% extraction. Several countries have implemented this method and achieved results. (2) A slightly slower method: widespread promotion through production and sales cooperatives. For example, various regions can divide the work and use persuasion methods to make everyone understand that 85% extraction flour is beneficial to the health of the masses. At the same time, contact flour mills to place orders, and ask the mills to deliver 85% extraction standard flour regularly (every few days) to supply the needs of the people. In this way, relying on the production and sales cooperative method, the people do not have to worry about not being able to buy 85% extraction standard flour, and the mills do not have to worry about the slow sales of 85% extraction flour.

### 吃粗白面比吃细白面好

　　吃粗白面比吃细白面好
    倪章祺
    粗白面（即八五折面粉——每百斤小麦磨细而筛得八十五斤面粉）在营养的价值上比细白面（即七折至七三折上白面粉——每百斤小麦磨细而筛得七十三斤面粉）要好得多，这已是许多人都知道的问题。
    若是我们能实行以“八五折面粉”代替“七至七三折上白面”时，是一件增产工作，可以减少麦粒表层物质的浪费，增加有益物质的利用。同时亦有利于人民的健康。若能这样实行全国小麦的产量，虽然仍旧每年大约四百余亿斤，然而面粉的产量每年可增加四十余万万斤。在粮食急需增产的今天，确能因改良磨法而增加数十亿斤面粉。
    此外，在质的方面也有好处。如乙种维生素一，即可获得数倍的增加，人民每年获得乙种维生素一的增加，约等于四百多万万斤头号面粉所含之量的数倍。也就等于每年约多获数十万万万（数十万亿）国际单位的乙种维生素一。这数十万亿单位，足够供给二万万多人民每年的需要而维持健康。
    粗白面并含有很多的蛋白质类。人民因此每年可多获蛋白质类六万万斤，约等于三十多万万斤猪肉。同时也将助人民多获百万万公丝乙种维生素二，每年又助人民多利用了大约百亿公丝尼亚新。
    总之，小麦的胚及麸皮层含有丰富的蛋白质及维生素。各类重要有益物质，上白面粉的胚和麸皮层几乎完全被筛去而损失，八五折面粉的胚和麸皮层虽筛去一部分而尚留存一部分。所以，粗面粉虽略黄糙但富于滋养料，外观虽不很白而营养价值远胜过上白头号面粉。
    推行这计划的具体办法：（一）比较简单的办法，由政府公布法令，指定从即日起各地面粉厂一律不再出比八五折更细白的面粉，顶白出品以八五折为标准。有数国曾行此办法而收功效。（二）稍为缓进的办法，即到处利用产销合作的推广。例如各地分工进行说服的方法使大家了解八五折面粉的有益于群众健康。同时与面粉厂接洽订购，请厂方按期（每隔数天）送一次八五折标准面粉以供给人民需要。这样靠产销合作的办法，人民不怕买不到八五折标准粉，厂方不怕八五折面粉的销路呆滞。
