Subsequently, joint large-scale benefit performances will be held separately by various drama and art guilds, troupes, and art groups for in-depth publicity. All proceeds from the benefit performances, after deducting necessary performance expenses, will be handed over to the Beijing All-Circles Disaster Relief Committee to donate to the disaster-stricken people.

Ticket prices are divided into four categories: 15,000, 10,000, 7,000, and 5,000 yuan. The Pingju Guild is scheduled to jointly perform "Husband and Wife Learn to Read," "Brother and Sister Reclaim Wasteland," and "Farmer's Tears" at Zhongshan Park on the afternoon of the 30th. The ticket price is uniformly 300 yuan. The Quyi (folk art) circles are scheduled to gather outstanding actors from the city at the Democratic Theater on the 6th of next month for a joint benefit performance. Lian Kuoru, Cao Baolu, Hua Xiaobao, Hou Baolin, Xin Lanyun and others will all participate, and the ticket prices will be set at 1,000, 700, and 400 yuan.

The People's Cultural Troupe, the China Youth Art Theater, and the three Cultural Troupes of North China University, as well as the Second and Third Troupes, are now concentrating their efforts on rushing to compile disaster relief skits. Excellent actors from each troupe have been selected and are preparing to rehearse.
    At the symposium on preparing for benefit performances for disaster relief held on the 26th, Xue Zizheng and Dong Ruqin, the deputy directors of the Beijing All-Circles Disaster Relief Committee, who were invited to participate, expressed their heartfelt gratitude and warm welcome to the literary and art circles for participating in the disaster relief campaign. They also conveyed that the municipal government will do its best to assist the literary and art circles in carrying out this righteous act of benefit performances.
