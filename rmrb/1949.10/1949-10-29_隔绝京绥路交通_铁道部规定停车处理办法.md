　　Isolating the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway Traffic
    Ministry of Railways Stipulates Handling Measures for Train Stoppages
    [Beijing News] In order to prevent the spread of pneumonic plague in Chahar Province, the Ministry of Railways, upon the order of the Government Administration Council, has isolated the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway traffic starting from the afternoon of the 27th of this month. Passenger and freight trains between Nankou and Zhangjiakou and between Zhangjiakou and Datong are completely suspended. Trains between Beijing and Nankou and between Datong and Baotou will operate as usual. The handling measures for passenger and freight trains in the area at that time are as follows: Trains en route that have arrived at Zhangjiakou or have not yet arrived at Zhangjiakou will all stop at Zhangjiakou or nearby stations, but passenger trains (empty) must return along the original route. Passenger and freight trains departing from Zhangjiakou are not allowed to enter Nankou and can stop at intermediate stations. Only locomotives are allowed to come to Nankou for coal and water and then promptly go to the holding station to pull the original train back to Zhangjiakou. Passenger trains (empty) should be sent back to the original departure station, and freight trains should be stopped at Zhangjiakou and handled after disinfection. The Tianjin Railway Bureau will handle the specific arrangements. Passengers who have not reached their destinations due to this are specially allowed to have their fares refunded or be sent back to their departure station free of charge according to railway reasons. Freight transport will be handled according to force majeure; freight charges for the un-transported portion of the journey will be refunded, and freight charges for returning to the departure station will be waived; and shippers are allowed to request changes to the destination station (arrival station). Furthermore, the Health Bureau of the Ministry of Railways dispatched 15,000 doses of pneumonic plague vaccine to Zhangjiakou on the 26th and set up quarantine stations at stations such as Nankou, Zhangjiakou, and Datong. Railway employees are also beginning to be vaccinated.
