Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 29th: The struggle to rescue the leaders of the American Communist Party continues to receive the support of people around the world, especially after Judge Medina refused to allow the imprisoned to enjoy the basic constitutional right to bail during the appeals process. The Worker's Daily published a telegram from Dixon, Chairman of the Australian Communist Party, to Truman, stating: "We strongly protest the imprisonment of eleven Communist leaders. This verdict violates the rights and freedoms of the people and encourages war. We demand their release." Gold, Chairman of the Labor Rescue Communist Leaders Joint Committee and leader of the Fur Workers Union of the CIO, announced that he had received a telegram of support from the French Hat Workers Union, vowing to fully rescue Boutah, the head of the Fur Workers Union, and other American Communist leaders.

The "National Non-Partisan Committee" for the rights of the twelve Communist leaders, headed by Harris and Robertson, sent a letter to Attorney General McGrath, urging the bail of Communist leaders. The letter was signed by forty celebrities, including former U.S. Assistant Attorney General Rogge, Catholic priest Duffy, professors Schuman, Fast, renowned economist Van Rick, and Professor Morrison.

The Executive Committee of the Progressive Party of New Hampshire unanimously passed a resolution to launch a mass movement to rescue the Communist leaders, believing that this mass movement is indispensable for preserving the constitutional rights to freedom of speech and assembly."

The Worker's Daily reported that more than 500 delegates attending the West Coast Conference of the "American Jewish Congress" passed a resolution asking the national leadership to demand the bail of the Communist leaders and to condemn the New York Federal Court for sentencing the American Communist leaders to imprisonment and fines based on the Smith Act as unconstitutional.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 29th: TASS, Washington: On the 27th, under the auspices of the American Civil Rights Congress, a delegation of 1,200 people (including the wives of Comrades Dennis, Gates, Winston, and Stacher) went to Washington to demand bail for the American Communist leaders while they appealed to higher courts. Patterson, Chairman of the Civil Rights Congress, the wives of the four imprisoned American Communist leaders, defense lawyers Rogge and Sorkin met with Attorney General McGrath and made this request. Afterwards, they told reporters that McGrath replied that he would consider their request. While they were meeting with McGrath, the delegates set up a picket line in front of the Justice Department.
