　　[Beijing News] The Beijing Branch of North China Electric Power Company, due to a malfunction of the No. 6 generator at the Shijingshan Power Plant, which reduced power generation by half, appealed to people from all walks of life in Beijing in late September to conserve electricity. After more than twenty days of publicity, it has achieved great results, maintained the power supply, and avoided zonal power outages. According to statistics from the branch company: last October, there were a total of 122,303 electricity users, with a maximum load of 39,000 kilowatts. This October, the number of electricity users increased to 123,020, while the maximum load was only 29,000 kilowatts, a decrease of more than 10,000 kilowatts. Originally, the supply was insufficient, but due to the launch of anti-electricity theft and automatic electricity conservation campaigns by various government agencies, factories, and organizations, considerable achievements were immediately made when this electricity conservation campaign was initially launched. Since the end of September, the district committees of the Chinese Communist Party, district governments, and public security sub-bureaus in various districts have also conducted extensive and in-depth publicity among citizens. The First and Second Districts have established electricity conservation committees and convened electricity conservation symposiums for factories, shops, employees, and managers. When the Second District convened a meeting of heads of police stations, it conveyed and discussed electricity conservation measures, and decided to adopt various forms of publicity, such as conducting household surveys and having police officers promote electricity conservation to merchants and residents during patrols. In the Eleventh District, the district government and public security sub-bureau formed five inspection teams to conduct persuasion and guidance on electricity conservation in areas such as Guang'anmen, Xuanwumen, and Nanheng Street. The Outer Fourth Public Security Sub-bureau has changed the 60-watt light bulbs of its affiliated police stations to 35 watts, replacing a total of six dozen; and the 40-watt bulbs to 15 watts, replacing a total of two dozen. Merchants and residents have also actively conserved electricity. For example, among the merchants in the Qianwai area under the jurisdiction of the Eighth District, 97 merchants have formulated electricity conservation plans and submitted them to the police station. For example, the Chang'an Restaurant in Xidan originally had 84 light bulbs in its 42 guest rooms, all of which were 40 watts. Now, 42 light bulbs have been removed, and the remaining light bulbs have been changed to 25 watts, and the eight door lights have been changed to three. However, at present, some government agencies, shops, and factories do not pay attention to electricity conservation and have wasteful phenomena, such as using a large number of lights and not turning them off in time. This should be corrected immediately. The Beijing Branch of North China Electric Power Company hopes that people from all walks of life will continue to conserve electricity and overcome the difficult period.

　　各区大力宣传推动
    京市节电获成效
    避免了分区停电
    【北京讯】华北电业公司北京分公司，以石景山发电所六号发电机发生故障，发电量减了一半，曾于九月下旬吁请京市各界人民节约用电。经过二十多天的宣传，已收到很大的效果，维持了电量的供应，和避免了分区停电。据该分公司统计：去年十月用电户共有十二万二千三百零三户，最高负荷量是三万九千千瓦，今年十月用电户增到十二万三千零二十户，而最高负荷量仅到二万九千千瓦，减少了一万多千瓦。本来供应不够，但由于各机关、工厂、团体展开反窃电及自动节约用电运动，使这次节电初步展开时便马上收到了相当成绩，各区中共区委会、区公所、公安分局自九月底起也向市民作了广泛而深入的宣传，一区、二区都成立了节电委员会，并分别召集工厂、商店、职工、经理开了节电座谈会。二区召集各派出所长会议时，传达并讨论了节电办法，决定采取各种形式进行宣传，如调查户口、警士巡逻时向商民宣传等。十一区由区公所、公安分局组成五个检查小组，分别在广安门、宣武门、南横街等处进行劝导节电。外四公安分局已将所属派出所的六十瓦灯泡改为三十五瓦，共换了六打；四十瓦改为十五瓦，共换了两打；各商民也都纷纷节电，如八区管辖前外一带商户，有九十七家商户拟定了节电计划送给派出所。又如西单长安饭店四十二间宿房内原有电灯八十四盏，灯泡均为四十瓦，现已撤去四十二盏，余下灯泡改为二十五瓦，门灯八盏改为三盏。但目前，还有个别机关、商店、工厂对节电不注意，存有浪费现象，如：盏数用得很多，不及时关闭等。这点应立即予以纠正。华北电业公司北京分公司希望各界人民继续节约用电，渡过困难时期。
