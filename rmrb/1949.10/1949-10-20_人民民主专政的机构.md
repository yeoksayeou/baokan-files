　　The third meeting of the Central People's Government Committee of the People's Republic of China on the 19th of this month unanimously approved the appointment of the responsible personnel of the Government Administration Council and its subordinate committees, ministries, commissions, academies, administrations, and banks, and also approved the appointment of the responsible personnel of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission, the Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, and the General Office of the Central People's Government. The entire organizational structure of our country's Central People's Government has now been fully established. This is the most unified, most complete, and most powerful Central People's Government of the people themselves in Chinese history; this is the organ of our people's democratic dictatorship. Under the leadership of this Central People's Government, we will victoriously complete the cause of unifying all of China, carry out various construction tasks throughout the country, realize the tasks stipulated in the General Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and various policies such as economic, cultural and educational, ethnic, and foreign affairs, and military systems, and realize the construction of an independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, and prosperous New Democratic nation.

　　The organizational scale of this Central People's Government is grand, and its institutions are complete, which is unprecedented in Chinese history. Under the Government Administration Council, there are four committees: Political and Legal, Financial and Economic, Cultural and Educational, and People's Supervision, including 30 departments such as ministries, commissions, academies, and administrations responsible for internal affairs, foreign affairs, public security, finance, banking, trade, industry and mining, transportation, culture, education, ethnic affairs, and overseas Chinese affairs, to implement the arduous and arduous construction tasks entrusted by the people of the whole country. In China, which has 9.6 million square kilometers of territory and 475 million people, and under the unprecedentedly unified situation and unprecedentedly arduous construction tasks, such a large-scale and complete Central People's Government is absolutely necessary.

　　The entire selection of this Central People's Government has been fully consulted in advance, so it is also the most appropriate. It concentrates the leading figures of various democratic parties, people's organizations, ethnic minorities, overseas Chinese, and other patriotic democratic elements, and embodies the nature of a united government of a united front led by the working class, based on the worker-peasant alliance, and uniting all democratic classes. As early as 1945, Chairman Mao Zedong clearly instructed in "On the Coalition Government": "After China has a democratic electoral system in the future, regardless of whether the Communist Party is the majority party or the minority party in the National Assembly, the government should be a coalition government working under a commonly recognized New Democratic program, which will be more conducive to better completing the New Democratic construction cause." After 28 years of arduous struggle, the Chinese Communist Party led the people of the whole country to defeat the imperialists and the Kuomintang bandit gang they supported, achieved the great victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War and the People's Revolution, realized the great unity of the people of the whole country, convened the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference which exercised the functions of the National People's Congress, formulated the Great Charter of the Chinese People, and elected the Chairman, Vice-Chairmen, and members of the Central People's Government. Now the Central People's Government Committee has approved the appointment of the responsible personnel of the Central People's Government, which proves that the Chinese Communist Party has practiced the wise instructions of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, four years ago, and also proves the Chinese Communist Party's selfless dedication and sincere cooperation with various democratic parties and democratic classes to build the country.

　　Today, the people of the whole country should not only celebrate the establishment of the various institutions of the Central People's Government and the appropriateness of the candidates, but also firmly believe that this complete and well-staffed Central People's Government must be the most efficient and honest government in Chinese history. Under the unified leadership of democratic centralism, it will be able to clearly define responsibilities, make the best use of talents, give full play to the highest efficiency, practice integrity and public service, and fulfill its responsibilities for the construction of New China. We believe that under the leadership of this Central People's Government, the people of the whole country will quickly realize the Great Charter of the Chinese People, eliminate the remnant bandits, liberate all of China, and build an independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, and prosperous New China.

### 人民民主专政的机构

　　人民民主专政的机构
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府委员会本月十九日第三次会议，全体一致通过任命了政务院及所属各委员会，各部、会、院、署、行的负责人员，并通过任命了人民革命军事委员会、最高人民法院、最高人民检察署、中央人民政府办公厅等负责人员。我国中央人民政府的全部组织机构于此完全建立起来了。这是中国历史上空前的人民自己的最统一、最完备、最强有力的中央人民政府，这是我们人民民主专政的机构。在这个中央人民政府的领导之下，即将胜利完成统一全中国的事业，开展全国的各项建设工作，实现中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领总纲所规定的任务及经济、文教、民族、外交等各项政策和军事制度，实现独立、民主、和平、统一和富强的新民主主义的国家建设。
    这个中央人民政府组织规模之宏大、机构之完备，在中国历史上也是空前的。在政务院之下，设有政治法律、财政经济、文化教育、人民监察等四个委员会，并包括了内务、外交、公安、财政、金融、贸易、工矿、交通、文化、教育、民族、侨务等各方面工作的部、会、院、署等三十个部门，来贯彻执行全国人民所赋予的，繁重艰巨的建设任务。在拥有九百六十万方公里的国土和四万万七千五百万人口的中国，而又在空前统一的情况和空前艰巨的建设任务下，这样规模宏大、机构完备的中央人民政府是完全必需的。
    这个中央人民政府的全部人选是事先经过充分协商的，因而也是最恰当的，它集中了各民主党派，各人民团体，各少数民族，国外华侨及其他爱国民主分子的领导人物，是体现了工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的、团结各民主阶级的统一战线的联合政府的性质。毛泽东主席早在一九四五年“论联合政府”中已经明白指示：“中国将来有了民主选举制度以后，不论共产党是国民大会中的多数党或少数党，政府都应该是在一个共同承认的新民主主义的纲领之下从事工作的联合政府，才有利于更好地完成新民主主义的建设事业。”中国共产党经过二十八年的艰苦奋斗，领导全国人民打败了帝国主义及其所支持的国民党匪帮，取得了中国人民解放战争和人民革命的伟大胜利，实现全国人民的大团结，召开了执行全国人民代表大会职权的中国人民政治协商会议，制定了中国人民的大宪章，选举了中央人民政府主席、副主席及委员，现在中央人民政府委员会又通过任命了中央人民政府的各项负责人员，这就证明中国共产党是实践了中国人民伟大领袖毛主席在四年前的英明指示，也证明了中国共产党的大公无私，与各民主党派及各民主阶级合作建国的真心诚意。
    全国人民，今天不仅要欢庆中央人民政府各项机构的建立和人选的得宜，而且坚信这一完备而得人的中央人民政府一定是中国历史上最有效能、最廉洁的政府。在民主集中的统一领导下，必能职责分明，人尽其材，发挥最高效能，厉行廉洁奉公，为新中国建设而尽其职责。我们相信全国人民，在这个中央人民政府领导下，必将迅速实现中国人民的大宪章，肃清残匪，解放全中国，建成一个独立、民主、和平、统一和富强的新中国。
