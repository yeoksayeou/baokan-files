The resolution is as follows:

The Saint-Denis Municipal Council warmly salutes the establishment of the People's Republic of China under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong of the Communist Party of China and congratulates the 500 million men and women on strengthening the democratic and peaceful camp; they have expressed their willingness to live a free life.

The Saint-Denis Municipal council believes that the recognition of the People's Republic of China by the great Soviet Union of Lenin and Stalin and the New Democratic countries will greatly contribute to the cause of democratic socialist peace.

Convinced that it represents the sentiments of the French people, the Saint-Denis Municipal Council hopes that France will form a democratic coalition government that will recognize the government headed by Mao Zedong, so that the friendship between the Chinese and French peoples will be further strengthened.

Long live the friendship between the Chinese and French peoples! Long live the People's Republic of China!
