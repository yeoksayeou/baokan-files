　　Contradictions Between Britain and the United States
    Su Weikeduonuo夫 (Su Viktorov)
    Gerasimov, a reader of Pravda in Moscow, asked the editorial department: Are there any contradictions between Britain and the United States now? Viktorov of the newspaper's editorial department replied as follows:
    Comrade Stalin pointed out as early as 1928 that the contradictions between Britain and the United States had become the fundamental contradiction within the capitalist camp.
    "Whether it is the oil issue," Comrade Stalin said, "oil has a decisive significance for capitalist economic construction; whether it is the market for selling goods, the sales market has a serious significance for the survival and development of capitalism, because without a reliable sales outlet for goods, these goods cannot be produced; whether it is the market for capital export, capital export is the most important characteristic of the imperialist stage; finally, whether it is the issue of transportation to the sales market and raw material market; in short, all these important issues lead to an important topic - the struggle between Britain and the United States for world hegemony."
    These situations that Comrade Stalin spoke of more than 20 years ago still exist today. Due to the following two points, these situations have gained special significance: first, due to the increasing sharpness of the general crisis of capitalism and its inherent contradictions; second, because after the collapse of Hitler's Germany and Japanese imperialism, only two major powers remained in the capitalist camp, because France has fallen to the status of a second-rate country.
    American imperialism, which grew fat and made a fortune in the war, is stubbornly pursuing world hegemony. At the same time, although British imperialism has been weakened by the war, it still retains many of the most important strategic bases, huge colonial markets, and raw material producing areas. It still wants to maintain its position. American monopolists, who are eager to swallow the world in one gulp, are unwilling to tolerate such a situation. That is why in the years after the war, American imperialism has particularly intensified its attack on all political, strategic, and economic positions of the British Empire.
    The ruling classes of Britain and the United States jointly carry out aggressive policies and policies of launching new wars, jointly participate in the military alliances they have established that are hostile to the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, and jointly suppress the national liberation movements in colonial and dependent countries, but these facts have not alleviated the contradictions that exist between them.
    During the Second World War, the United States, as an exchange for assistance given to Britain, seized all of Britain's bases on the American Atlantic coast under the banner of "lease for ninety-nine years." The United States took advantage of Britain's economic and financial difficulties to completely squeeze it out of the Latin American market, while more strongly and decisively invading all markets of the British Empire. American imperialists have established their hegemony in Canada, where American investment has exceeded five billion US dollars. They have grabbed Australia under their influence and control (American goods exported to Australia have increased by two times compared to pre-war, exceeding British goods imports by one time, which is extremely important). They are increasingly stubbornly invading India and other countries in Southeast Asia, pushing out their British competitors. Needless to say, the strategic bases in the Pacific are no longer in the hands of Britain, but in the hands of the United States of America.
    At the same time, the United States uses all methods to prevent Britain from restoring some of its positions in the Americas, especially in Latin American countries. Just these days, a fierce dispute is burning between Britain and the United States due to Britain's conclusion of a commercial agreement with Argentina. The United States is threatening Britain with economic pressure and openly demanding the abolition of this agreement.
    A very fierce struggle is also taking place between British and American imperialism for the oil resources of the Near East and Middle Eastern countries. In Iran, in Iraq, in Saudi Arabia, in Kuwait, in every country in the Near East and Middle East, British and American interests are in conflict with each other. The struggle for interests between British and American oil companies has also triggered a struggle between Britain and the United States for political influence in these countries, as well as a struggle for invading the strategic positions of these countries. This is manifested in the increasingly sharp relations and conflicts between individual countries in the Near East and Middle East. The recent conflict between Syria and Iran -- American influence is increasingly consolidated in Syria, while Iran is a British semi-colony -- this is precisely to say that the conflict between Britain and the United States is impossible to conceal, and it is not something else.
    Due to the struggle for Near Eastern oil fields, the Mediterranean issue has also gained particularly great significance. For decades, British imperialists have regarded the Mediterranean -- this road to the oil-rich resources of the Near East, the sea route to India -- as the most important strategic line of the British Empire, as its "backbone," and have been fighting to control it entirely. Now it has lost this control. As the Romanian newspaper "Univerzul" famously said, now the flag of American imperialism is flying on every section of this backbone. American imperialists have their own bases in Italy and in former Italian colonies, and they have grabbed the former British bases in Greece into their own hands.
    The United States of America is not only squeezing out Britain in the Americas and in the markets of the British Empire. It is also squeezing out Britain in Europe itself, while widely using the notorious so-called Marshall Plan for this purpose, which is "the generous assistance of American benefactors to the British people." Sometimes the "Marshall Plan" is not regarded as assistance to European countries, but as their enslavement. Under the assistance of the "Marshall Plan," the Americans have obtained guarantees to fill Europe with their own goods and prevent British goods from invading there. Not only that, but American imperialists, on the basis of the "Marshall Plan," have actually prevented the British from developing trade with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. At the same time, the issue of strengthening the export of its own goods has extremely great significance for Britain. It should be noted that long before the war, Britain had to import large amounts of raw materials and food, which exceeded the export of British goods. However, Britain could still make up for the excess of imports over exports with the income from its foreign investments and the income from the shipping industry. Now Britain has lost this possibility: because its investments have sharply decreased during the war; due to competition with the American commercial fleet, the income from the shipping industry has also plummeted. That is why the British ruling class has set itself the task of at least doubling its commodity exports.
    The American monopoly capital, on the other hand, has also set itself the task of vigorously strengthening its own goods exports, which have no sales in the increasingly narrow and shrinking domestic market. From the first day after the end of the war, the United States has resolutely attacked the British market, using all kinds of methods. For example, when the United States lent loans to Britain, it demanded that the tariff system that greatly reduced the preferential British goods existing in Britain be used as a condition. Now, under the conditions of the looming crisis, the struggle between Britain and the United States for markets will inevitably become more acute.
    The so-called cooperation between imperialist powers can never exclude the contradictions between them, nor can it exclude the struggle between them. It is enough to cite this one thing: on the German issue, the United States is cooperating with Britain, but it has grabbed control of the Ruhr area into its own hands.
    Comrade Stalin said as early as 1925: In the British and American camp, in the capitalist camp, there is no unity, what dominates in that camp is the struggle for interests.
    It is also very significant that American imperialism even uses its joint participation in military alliances with Britain to strengthen the latter's subordination to it. For example, the United States implements arms standardization and uses the frantic arms race of the participants in the North Atlantic Treaty to increase the already very serious economic difficulties of British imperialism and increase pressure on it. The struggle between Britain and the United States is clearly dominated by the United States. No wonder people call their cooperation the cooperation between a rider and a horse.
    Some people will ask: In that case, how can the fact that Britain is also carrying out such cooperation be explained? The explanation lies here: the common hatred of progressive and democratic forces has united the British and American ruling classes. British imperialists have to rely on American monopoly capital, which is the bastion of reaction throughout the world. The British ruling class participates in the American aggressive plan, even as a minion of the United States, and also intends to grab something for itself. As evidenced by the repeated talks of the great war-monger Churchill, the British imperialists' plan is this: perhaps they can incite a conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union, so that they can weaken the two opponents and restore the power and influence of the British Empire to some extent.
    This plan is not new. It is still the old plan of the former British imperialists that has already failed miserably, with only one difference: at that time, they wanted to incite a conflict between Germany and the Soviet Union. Their current plan will also fail in the same way.

　　英美之间的矛盾
    苏·维克多诺夫
    莫斯科的真理报读者盖拉西莫夫问编辑部：现在英美之间可有矛盾存在？该报编辑部维克多诺夫答复如下：
    斯大林同志远在一九二八年就曾指出，英美之间的矛盾已成为资本主义阵营内的根本矛盾。
    “无论是就石油问题来说，——斯大林同志曾说过——石油对于资本主义经济建设有着决定性的意义；无论是就推销商品的市场问题来说，销货市场对于资本主义之生存和发展有严重的意义，因为商品没有可靠的销路，就不能进行这些商品的生产；就资本输出的市场问题来说，资本输出是帝国主义阶段的最重要的特征；最后，无论是就通向销货市场和原料市场的交通问题来说；总之所有这些重要问题都推向一个重要课题——英美间为争夺世界霸权而斗争的课题。”
    斯大林同志在二十多年以前所说的这些情形，现在仍然存在。由于下列两点，现在这些情形更获得了特别的意义：其一，由于资本主义的总危机和它固有的矛盾日益尖锐；其二，由于在希特勒德国和日本帝国主义崩溃之后，资本主义阵营内只剩下了两大强国，因为法国已降到第二等国家的地位。
    在战争中长肥了、发了财的美帝国主义，在顽强地追求世界霸权。同时，虽然英帝国主义被战争削弱了，在它掌握中仍保留着许多最重要的战略基地，巨大的殖民地市场、原料产地。它仍想保持自己的阵地。渴望一口吞尽世界的美国独占资本家们不愿忍受这样的情形。这就是为什么战后数年中，美帝国主义特别加强地向大英帝国一切政治、战略、经济阵地进攻。
    英美统治阶级合力进行侵略政策和发动新战争的政策，合力参加他们搞起来的敌视苏联和人民民主国家的军事联盟，合力进行镇压殖民地和附属国家的民族解放运动，然而这些事实绝没有减轻存在于他们之间的矛盾。
    在第二次世界大战期间，美国就已作为交换给英国的援助，在“租借九十九年”的旗帜之下，把英国在美洲大西洋沿岸的基地都一把夺走了。美国曾利用英国在经济财政上的困难，把它完全挤出了拉丁美洲的市场，同时更加强地、断然地侵入大英帝国的一切市场。美帝国主义者们树立了自己在加拿大的霸权，美国在那儿的投资已超过五十亿美元。他们已把澳洲抓住在自己的势力和控制之下（美国输往澳洲的商品已较战前增加了二倍，已超过英商品输入的一倍，这一点极为重要）。他们日益顽强地侵入印度，侵入东南亚的其他国家，排挤他们的英籍竞争者。更无须说太平洋的战略基地已不在英国，而是在北美合众国手中了。
    同时美国并用一切方法阻止英国恢复它在美洲的一部分阵地，尤其是在拉丁美洲各国的阵地。恰巧这几天英美之间，由于英国与阿根廷缔结商务协定这一件事，正燃炽着激烈的争论。美国以经济压力威胁英国，公开要求废止这个协定。
    英美帝国主义之间，为了争夺近东和中东各国的石油资源，也正在进行着非常激烈的斗争。在伊朗、在伊拉克、在沙地阿拉伯、在科威特、在近东和中东每一个国家，英美利益都互相冲突。英美石油公司间为利益的斗争，又引起了英美间在这些国家争取政治影响的斗争，以及争取侵入各该国的战略阵地的斗争。这一点表现于近东和中东各个别国家的关系和冲突日益尖锐。不久前曾发生叙利亚和伊朗之间的冲突，——在叙利亚美国势力正日益稳固，而伊朗则是英国的半殖民地——这正是说英美间的冲突无从隐饰，并非另外的什么事。
    由于争取近东油田的斗争，地中海问题也获得了特别巨大的意义。数十年来英帝国主义者都把地中海——这条通向近东石油富源的道路，通向印度的海道——当作大英帝国的最重要的战略干线，当作它的“脊椎骨”，一直在为整个地控制它而斗争。现在它已丧失了这一控制权。正如罗马尼亚“乌尼委苏尔”报纸上的名言所说的，现在这根脊椎骨上的每一节都飘荡着美帝国主义的旗帜。美帝国主义者在意大利、在前意国殖民地上都有自己的根据地，他们已把从前英国在希腊的根据地都抢到自己手中来了。
    北美合众国不仅在美洲，在大英帝国的市场上也排挤英国。它也在欧洲本土排挤英国，同时又为了这一目的，广泛地利用臭名远扬的所谓马歇尔计划，这计划就是“美国恩人给英国人民的宽宏大量的援助”。有时“马歇尔计划”并没被当作给欧洲国家的援助，而被当作给他们的奴役。在“马歇尔计划”的援助之下，美国人得到了保证，使自己的货物充满欧洲，阻止英国货侵入那儿。不但如此，美帝国主义者在“马歇尔计划”的基础上，实际地阻止了英国人发展对苏联及人民民主国家的贸易。同时，加强输出自己的商品这一问题，对于英国有着极巨大的意义。应该注意到远在战争之前，英国已不得不输入大量的原料和粮食，它们已超过了英国商品之输出。然而英国仍可以本国在国外投资的收入和海运业的收入来弥补输入对输出的超过额。现在英国已失掉了这种可能：因为在战争期间它的投资已锐减；由于与美国商业舰队的竞争，海运业的收入也已一落千丈。这就是为什么英国统治阶级给自己提出了这个任务：最少要使自己的商品输出增加一倍。
    美国独占资本那一方面也给自己提出了竭力加强自己的货物输出，在日益狭小萎缩的国内市场，这些货物已没有销路。从战争结束后第一天起，美国就坚决地进攻英国市场，利用各种各样的方法。例如，美国借给英国借款时，要求大大地减轻存在于英国的优惠英国货的关税制度，作为条件。现在在危机逼近的条件下，英美间争夺市场的斗争不可避免地将更形尖锐。
    帝国主义列强间的所谓合作，绝不能排除它们间的矛盾，也不能排除它们之间的斗争。只要举出这一件事来就足够了：在德国问题上，美国是与英国合作的，然而它却把鲁尔区的控制权抓在自己手里。
    斯大林同志远在一九二五年就说过：在英美阵营里，在资本主义阵营里，没有统一，在那阵营里支配着的是争夺权益。
    美帝国主义甚至利用它用英国合力参加军事联盟，来加强后者隶属于它，这也意味非常深长。例如美国实行军备标准化，利用北大西洋公约参加者的疯狂的军备竞赛，来增加不如此就已非常严重的英帝国主义的经济困难，增强对它的压力。英美间的斗争显然是美国占上风。难怪人们称他们间的合作为骑马者与马儿的合作。
    有人会问：既如此，英国也进行这样的合作这一事实将如何解释呢？解释在这里：对进步的、民主的力量的共同的憎恨，使英美统治阶级联合起来了。英帝国主义者不得不倚靠作为全世界反动堡垒的美国独占资本。英国统治阶级参加进美国的侵略计划，虽然是作为美国的一名小喽罗，也打算给自己抢点东西。从大战争贩子邱吉尔屡次的谈话可以得到证明，英帝国主义的打算是这样的：也许能煽起美苏间的冲突，如此就可以得到削弱两名敌手并多少地恢复大英帝国的威力和影响的结果。
    这种打算并不新鲜。仍是从前英帝国主义者们的已经惨酷地失败了的旧打算，只有一点不同，那时是想煽起德苏间的冲突。他们现在的打算也同样的会失败。    （徐芝延  译）
