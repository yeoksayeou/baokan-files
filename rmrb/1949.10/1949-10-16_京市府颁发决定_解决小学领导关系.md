Beijing Municipal Government Issues Decision to Resolve Leadership Relationships in Primary Schools

[Beijing News] There are a large number of municipal national primary schools in this city (currently there are 615 public and private primary schools in urban and suburban areas). To facilitate leadership and improve work efficiency, the "central school district" system has been maintained since liberation (urban and suburban areas are divided into 48 central school districts, each with a central primary school responsible for the business leadership of all primary schools in the district). At the same time, the district government has a Bureau of Culture and Education, leading cultural and educational work in the entire district. In order to unify steps and avoid multi-headed leadership, the Beijing Municipal People's Government has stipulated that the administrative leadership relationship of primary schools in urban areas is: central primary schools are directly under the Education Bureau, general primary schools are under the District Bureau of Culture and Education, which in turn reports to the Education Bureau, and central primary schools still have business leadership over general primary schools. (The leadership relationship of primary schools in suburban areas was not explicitly stipulated at that time because the boundaries of suburban areas were still changing).

At present, the organizational form of district power has changed, and the boundaries of suburban districts have been demarcated. In order to adapt to the new situation, the Beijing Municipal People's Government issued a "Decision on the Leadership Relationship between the Education Bureau and the Suburban Bureaus of Culture and Education, and the Central Primary Schools in Urban Areas" on the 12th to resolve the leadership relationship of primary schools. The full text of the decision is as follows:

(1) The leadership relationship between the Education Bureau and the Suburban Bureaus of Culture and Education:

1.  The Education Bureau is responsible for all overall issues, such as the determination of policies, guidelines, and tasks, the formulation of systems, the establishment of schools, the appointment and removal of principals and directors of complete primary schools, and the training of primary school teachers. The Suburban Bureaus of Culture and Education, under the guidance of the Education Bureau, conduct supervision and inspection, regularly reflect situations to the bureau, provide opinions, and report on work. There is a vertical leadership relationship between the Education Bureau and the Suburban Bureaus of Culture and Education in cultural and educational work, but the work of the Bureaus of Culture and Education is under the guidance of the District Head and is part of the district administrative structure, and should not form an independent phenomenon. Documents issued by the Education Bureau to suburban primary schools and social education institutions (referring to workers' and children's literacy classes and winter schools) are issued through the suburban district government, as stipulated below:

    ① The organization, structure, number of personnel, and staffing of primary schools shall be determined by the Education Bureau. The establishment of primary schools shall be determined by the Education Bureau based on needs and subjective strength, and the site shall be resolved by the district.

    ② The standard for primary school funding expenditures shall be determined by the Education Bureau, and the funds shall be received and distributed by the suburban finance department from the Finance Bureau, but it is guaranteed that education funds shall not be used for other purposes.

    ③ The Education Bureau is responsible for the regulations of the primary school system and other systems, curriculum, teaching materials, and school calendar.

    ④ The principals and teaching directors of suburban complete primary schools shall be appointed and removed by the Education Bureau, and primary school teachers shall be appointed and removed by the district, but must be reported to the bureau for approval in advance.

    ⑤ The Education Bureau is responsible for organizing primary school teacher training (referring to training classes and large-scale lectures). The Education Bureau and the Education Union lead the on-the-job learning of primary school teachers throughout the city. The district should assist in the learning of primary school teachers in each district.

    ⑥ The Education Bureau is responsible for the filing of private primary schools in suburban areas. The Suburban Bureau of Culture and Education shall be responsible for understanding, reviewing, and providing opinions.

    ⑦ Suburban primary school work reports are sent to the district, and the district reports to the bureau. Transcripts and reports are sent to the bureau in duplicate, transferred by the district to the bureau, and filed for future reference.

2.  In order to grasp policies, unify steps, and strengthen leadership, each district can establish a Cultural and Educational Committee to discuss and decide on the specific implementation of educational work in the district based on the guidelines, tasks, and requirements of higher authorities and the specific conditions of the district, check the progress, study improvement methods, and implement the decisions through the District Bureau of Culture and Education and the central primary school. Major events must also be reported to higher authorities through the District Bureau of Culture and Education. The committee shall not issue orders.

(2) The relationship between the Education Bureau and the central primary schools and national primary schools in urban areas; the relationship between the Suburban Bureaus of Culture and Education and the central primary schools and national primary schools in suburban areas.

1.  The Education Bureau leads the national primary schools in urban areas through the central primary schools. An additional deputy director of teaching shall be added to the central primary school to assist the principal in leading the work of the primary schools in the district. The accountant of the central primary school directly receives the funds for urban primary schools from the Education Bureau. The central primary school shall be responsible for understanding, reviewing, and providing opinions on the filing of private primary schools in urban areas.

2.  The suburban central primary schools are led by the district. The Suburban Bureau of Culture and Education should appropriately use the central primary schools as a tool to guide the national primary schools in business aspects. Therefore, the Bureau of Culture and Education and the central primary schools should periodically convene meetings of principals or teachers in the district to carry out the following tasks: (1) Assist in solving problems encountered in teaching work. (2) Summarize and exchange teaching experiences. (3) Arrange and inspect teacher training.

The Suburban Bureau of Culture and Education is fully responsible to the Education Bureau for the administrative leadership of the central primary schools and national primary schools, such as understanding the school situation, inspecting work, receiving and distributing funds, contacting parents, and helping to solve specific difficult problems. In this way, the district can concentrate its efforts on primary school and social education work.

　　京市府颁发决定
  　解决小学领导关系
    【北京讯】本市市属国民小学为数众多（现城、郊共有公私立小学六一五所），为使领导方便，增进工作效率，解放后仍维持“中心学区”制，（城、郊共分四十八个中心学区，每区设一中心小学，负责全区小学之业务领导）；同时，区政府又有文教科，领导全区文教工作。为统一步调，避免多头领导起见，本市人民政府曾规定城区小学之行政领导关系为：中心小学直属教育局，一般小学属区文教科，转报教育局，中心小学对一般小学仍有业务领导关系。（对郊区小学之领导关系，由于当时郊区界尚在变动，故未作明文规定）。
    目前，区政权已改变组织形式，郊区区界亦已划建就绪，本市人民政府为适应新的情况，于十二日颁发“关于教育局与郊区文教科、城区中心小学领导关系之决定”，以解决小学之领导关系，决定全文如下：
    （一）教育局与郊区文教科之领导关系：
    一、凡有关全面问题，如政策方针任务之确定、制度之规定、学校之设置、完小校长教导主任之任免、小学教职员之训练，均由教育局负责；郊区文教科秉承教育局进行督促检查定期向局反映情况，提供意见，汇报工作。教育局与郊区文教科在文教工作上有垂直领导关系，但文教科的工作受区长指导，为区行政机构之一部分，不得形成独立现象。教育局对郊区小学及社教机关（指工人、儿童补习班及冬学）之下行文件，均经郊区区政府下达，其规定如次：
    ①小学之组织、机构、人数、编制，由教育局厘定。小学之设置，由教育局根据需要与主观力量确定，其校址由区负责解决。
    ②小学经费开支标准由局厘定，经费由郊区财政科向财政局领取发放，但保证教育经费不得挪作他用。
    ③小学学制及其他制度、课程、教材、校历之规定，由局负责。
    ④郊区完小校长教导主任由局任免，小学教员由区任免，但事前报局核准。
    ⑤举办小学教员训练（指训练班，大型讲习会）等由局负责，全市小学教员之在职学习，由教育局与教联领导；各区小学教员学习，区应协助之。
    ⑥郊区私立小学之备案由局负责，郊区文教科应负责了解审查，提供意见。
    ⑦郊区小学工作汇报送区，由区向局汇报。交代报告送局二份，由区转局并存查。
    二、为掌握政策、齐一步调、加强领导，各区可建立文教委员会，根据上级方针任务与要求及本区具体情况，讨论决定本区教育工作之具体实施，检查进行情形，研究改进方法，议决后通过区文教科与中心小学实行之。较大事件，并须通过区文教科向上级报告，该会不得发布命令。
    （二）教育局与城区中心小学及国民小学之关系；郊区文教科与中心小学及国民小学之关系。
    一、教育局对城区国民小学通过中心小学领导之。中心小学增设副教导主任一人。襄助校长领导该区小学工作。城区小学经费由中心小学会计员直接向教育局领取。城区私立小学之备案，中心小学应负责了解审查，提供意见。
    二、郊区中心小学由区领导，郊区文教科应适切的利用中心小学作为业务方面指导国民小学的工具，因此文教科及中心小学对国民小学，应定期召开本区校长或教员会进行下列工作：（１）协助解决教学工作上发生的问题（２）教导经验的总结与交流。（３）教员进修的布置和检查。
    郊区文教科对中心小学及国民小学的行政领导，如学校情况之了解、工作之检查、经费之领发与学生家长之联系及帮助解决具体困难问题等，完全对局负责，这样区工作重点，可集中大力从事于小学与社教工作。
