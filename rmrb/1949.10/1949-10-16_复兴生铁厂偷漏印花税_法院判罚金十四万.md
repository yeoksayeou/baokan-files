　　Fuxing Ironworks Evades Stamp Tax
　　Court Fines 140,000

　　[Beijing News] The Fuxing Ironworks located at No. 20 Jia, Zhangchuanying, Twelfth District of this city, failed to issue invoices for the sale of finished pig iron products from January to the end of August this year. Neither of the two account books had stamp duty affixed. This was discovered by the Beijing Municipal People's Government Tax Bureau and submitted to the People's Court for handling. The turnover of the factory from January to May was 1,925,790 yuan. According to regulations, stamp tax should have been affixed at a rate of 3 per thousand, totaling 5,777.37 yuan. After deducting the 140 yuan already affixed, the actual amount of stamp tax that should have been affixed was 5,637.37 yuan. However, since the stamp tax regulations had not been promulgated for long at that time, a subsidy was granted to waive the penalty. The turnover of the factory from June to August was 1,222,200 yuan. According to regulations, stamp tax should have been affixed at a rate of 3 per thousand, totaling 3,666.60 yuan, and a penalty of 40 times the tax amount was imposed according to regulations, totaling 146,664 yuan. The court has ordered the factory to pay the full amount within five days.
