　　Two Historical Academic Groups in the Capital Hold Meeting Yesterday
　　[This newspaper dispatch] The China New History Research Association and the History United Association of the six universities in Beijing (Peking University, Normal University, Tsinghua University, Fu Jen Catholic University, Yenching University, Sino-French University) held a joint meeting at 3:00 PM on the 11th in the History Society of the School of Liberal Arts of Normal University. Hou Wailu, head of the History Department of Normal University, Yang Shaoxuan, editor of the Machine Improvement Association, and representatives of the History Society remaining at the university attended the meeting. More than 40 students from the History Department and other departments of Normal University were also present. Chairman Hou Wailu reported on the significance of convening the joint meeting and the process of preparing for the establishment of the China New History Research Association. He emphasized that the research of new history is an important task for implementing the "cultural and educational policy" in the Common Program, and it is a pioneering work, especially for the study of New Democracy.
　　At the meeting, opinions were fully exchanged on how to convene new history symposiums and lectures in a planned and step-by-step manner in the future, and how to establish close contact with history teachers in secondary schools. Representatives remaining at the university unanimously suggested that the New History Research Association publish specialized historical books and popular publications, compile excellent history textbooks for middle schools, and hoped to conduct further research on ancient historical sites and organize historians from all over the country to use the viewpoint and method of historical materialism to criticize the old history, and cultivate a pragmatic work style, in order to enrich the construction of new history.

　　开展新史学研究工作
    首都两史学团体昨开会
    【本报讯】中国新史学研究会与北京六大学（北大、师大、清华、辅仁、燕京、中法）史学联合会于十一日下午三时在师大文学院历史学会举行联席会议。出席师大历史系主任侯外庐、机器改进协会编审处长杨绍宣等与留校史学会代表，并有师大历史等系同学四十余人列席。主席侯外庐报告召开联席会议的意义与中国新史学研究会筹备成立的经过后，着重指出：新史学的研究为实行共同纲领中“文教政策”的一项重要任务，尤其对新民主主义的学习，是个打头阵的工作。
    会议上对今后如何有计划、有步骤地召开新史学座谈会和讲演会与中等学校历史教员取得密切联系诸问题，都充分交换了意见。留校代表一致建议新史学研究会出版专门的历史书刊和通俗刊物，编定优良的中学历史教材，更希望对古代史迹做进一步的考证和把全国各地研究历史的人组织起来，运用历史唯物论的观点和方法批判旧的历史，并养成实事求是的工作作风，以便充实新史学的建设工作。
