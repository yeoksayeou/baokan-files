    New U.S. Attempt to Pull Sweden into the North Atlantic Treaty
    Lisakov
    American pressure on Sweden is being carried out in a variety of forms. It uses three main methods to influence Sweden: economic pressure, creating war hysteria, and gradually bringing Sweden into the so-called "Atlantic system." In exerting pressure on Sweden, American warmongering merchants are particularly focusing on Sweden's shipping industry, shipbuilding industry, and Sweden's pulp and paper industry. For several months, American shipping companies have been increasing their cargo shipments to Europe, thereby primarily reducing the business of Swedish shipping companies. At the same time, orders from Western European countries to Swedish shipyards have also decreased because their American competitors themselves need orders. The activities of American merchants surrounding Sweden's exports of fiber and pulp to the United States and certain Marshall Plan countries are a huge blackmail conspiracy. They are tightening the noose on the market for these Swedish exports, demanding further reductions in the price of Swedish fiber and pulp. At the same time, foreign Shylocks (the usurious merchant in Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice) openly hint that all these problems could be solved if Sweden joins the "Atlantic system." A leading position in the arsenal of American pressure on Sweden is occupied by the planned incitement of war psychology and threats of imminent war. American agents in Sweden tirelessly repeat their old slander against the Soviet Union, the so-called "war threat to Sweden from the East," the absurdity of which is clearly visible. The Soviet Union's policy of adhering to peace is known to the whole world. If the American agents in Stockholm continue to slander the Soviet Union, despite this, it only proves their attempt to tie Sweden to the chariot of American imperialist warmongers. It is worth pointing out the activities of American agents in Northern Europe, which aim to gradually drag Sweden into the infamous "North Atlantic military system." The prelude to these measures was the discussion held in Stockholm two months ago on the issue of so-called "limited Nordic regional military cooperation." This was followed by steps to organize such cooperation, such as joint exercises of the armed forces of Scandinavian countries, Swedish warships participating in naval exercises with Norway and Denmark, visits by senior military personnel from Oslo and Copenhagen to Stockholm, and visits by senior military personnel from Stockholm to the aforementioned two places. Recent specialized military discussions held at the Scandinavian Ministerial Meeting in Copenhagen, and so on. The author points out that it is natural that broad sections of the Swedish people, as well as the country's progressive and sober-minded businessmen, cannot tolerate this policy. They understand what disastrous consequences it would have for Sweden if it participated in the Anglo-American policy of preparing for a new war. This was confirmed during the "Peace Week" held in Sweden in September. Basic logic shows that any military cooperation between Sweden and the North Atlantic Treaty countries, or directly with the United States, regardless of what reservations are made about "limited purposes," will bring Sweden into the whirlpool of the aggressive military bloc's gambling policy, thereby causing irreparable harm to the Swedish national economy.

    美帝把瑞典拉入北大西洋公约的新企图
    里萨科夫
    美国对瑞典的压力是以多种多样的形式来进行的。它用三个主要的办法来影响瑞典：经济压力，引起战争歇斯底里和逐渐使瑞典归附于所谓“大西洋体系”。在对瑞典施以压力时，美国好战的商人们特别集中力量于瑞典的航运业、造船业、以及瑞典的纸浆和造纸工业。几个月来，美国航运公司一直在增加他们的船只对欧洲的货运，因而首先是减少瑞典航运公司的业务。同时，西欧各国对瑞典造船厂的订货也有减少，因为他们的美国竞争者本身需要别人订货。美国商人围绕着瑞典对美国及某些马歇尔化国家的出口货纤维与纸浆的活动，乃是巨大的敲诈阴谋。他们一步紧一步地限制瑞典这些出口货的市场，要求进一步减低瑞典纤维与纸浆的价格。同时，外国的歇洛克们（莎士比亚威尼斯商人一剧中高利贷剥的商人）公然暗示，如果瑞典加入“大西洋体系”，则这一切问题都可能解决。美国对瑞典之压力的武库中占首要地位的便是有计划的煽起战争心理和以战争迫在眉睫相威胁。美国在瑞典的代理人哓哓不休地重弹其诽谤苏联的老调，所谓“来自东方的对瑞典的战争威胁”，这种诽谤的荒诞无稽是显然可见的。苏联的坚持和平政策，为全世界所周知。如果美国在斯德哥尔摩的代理人不顾这一点而继续诽谤苏联，就是能证明他们把瑞典束缚在美帝国主义者迁徒的兵车上的企图。值得指出的是美国在北欧的代理人的活动，这些活动旨在逐渐把瑞典拖入臭名远扬的“北大西洋军事体系”。这些措施的序曲而是两个月前在斯德哥尔摩举行的关于所谓“有限度的北欧区域军事合作”问题的讨论。随之即采取了组织这种合作的步骤，诸如斯堪的纳维亚国家武装部队的联合演习，瑞典军舰参加挪威与丹麦的海军演习，奥斯陆和哥本哈根高级军事人员的访问斯德哥尔摩及斯德哥尔摩高级军人的访问上述两地。最近在哥本哈根举行的斯堪的纳维亚国家部长会议上举行的专门军事讨论等等。该文作者指出，瑞典人民的广大阶层以及该国进步而头脑清醒的商人不能容忍这一政策，这一点是很自然的。他们了解，如果瑞典参加了英美准备新战争的政策，对瑞典会具有何等的灾难性。这一点在瑞典九月间举行的“和平周”时得到了证实。基本的逻辑表明，瑞典与北大西洋公约国家，或者直接与美国进行的任何军事合作，不管关于“有限目的”作什么保留，将会把瑞典带入侵略性军事集团赌博政策的漩涡，从而予瑞典国民经济以无可补救的危害。
