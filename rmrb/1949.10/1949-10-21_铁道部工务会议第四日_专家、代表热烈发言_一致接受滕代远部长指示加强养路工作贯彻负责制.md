　　Fourth Day of Ministry of Railways Engineering Conference
  　Experts and Representatives Speak Enthusiastically
    Unanimously Accepting Minister Teng Daiyuan's Instructions to Strengthen Track Maintenance and Implement Responsibility System
    [Our Newspaper] Yesterday (20th) was the fourth day of the Ministry of Railways National Engineering Conference. Engineering representatives from various railway bureaus expressed their opinions, and many experts delivered key speeches. In the speeches of the engineering representatives from various bureaus, all expressed their acceptance of Minister Teng Daiyuan's instructions to strengthen track maintenance and implement the spirit of the responsibility system. Zhang Fen, the representative from the Zhengzhou Bureau, reviewed their track maintenance work and said that the Zhengzhou Bureau's track maintenance work was not done well because the employees did not pay enough attention to this work ideologically; in the future, they will definitely follow the requirements of the Ministry of Railways and improve the shortcomings in their previous work. The southern bureaus paid close attention to the reports on track maintenance work in the Northeast and expressed that they would learn from them. The main reasons for the success of track maintenance work in the Northeast General Bureau and the Tianjin Bureau are: (1) relying on the masses of workers; (2) learning from Soviet experience.
    Shao Fuqiu, professor at Tangshan Jiaotong University, said that the new track maintenance method in the Northeast and the reports on track maintenance work from various bureaus were something he had never heard before. For more than 30 years, I have also wanted to solve the track maintenance problem, but to no avail. Today, I know that "relying on the strength of the masses is the only way to do track maintenance work well."
    Bridge expert Mao Yisheng believes that bridge construction must be standardized. He said that repairing bridges is not restoring the old, but moving forward. Many of the standards for bridges in the past were not suitable. He said: In the future, new bridges should use reinforced concrete as much as possible. China produces cement and reinforcing steel, which is in line with economic principles, but it must also be based on the actual conditions in various places. Finally, he hopes that engineering experts will work hard to learn Soviet languages ​​and scripts so that they can better learn from Soviet experience.

　　铁道部工务会议第四日
  　专家、代表热烈发言
    一致接受滕代远部长指示加强养路工作贯彻负责制
    【本报讯】昨（二十日）为铁道部全国工务会议第四日。各铁路局工务代表发表意见，许多专家作了重点发言。在各局工务代表的讲话中，一致表示接受滕代远部长的指示，加强养路工作，贯彻负责制精神。郑州局代表张奋检讨他们的养路工作时说，郑州局养路工作做得不好，是由于员工们在思想上没有重视此项工作；今后一定遵照铁道部的要求，改进以往工作中的缺点。南方各局对于东北养路工作的报告非常注意，都表示要好好学习。东北总局及天津局养路工作成功的主要原因有二：（一）依靠工人群众；（二）学习苏联经验。
    唐山交通大学教授邵福＠说，东北新养路法和各局养路工作的报告，是过去所没听到的。三十多年来我也曾想要解决养路问题，但终无结果，今天我知道了“依靠群众力量，才能把养路工作做好。”
    桥梁专家茅以升认为修建桥梁必须标准化。他说，修复桥梁不是复旧，而是要向前推进一步，过去桥梁的标准有很多是不适合的。他说：今后新建桥梁，应多采用钢筋混凝土。中国出产洋灰和钢筋，合乎经济原则，但也要根据各地的实际情况而定。最后，他希望工程专家们努力学习苏联语言文字，以便更好地学习苏联经验。
