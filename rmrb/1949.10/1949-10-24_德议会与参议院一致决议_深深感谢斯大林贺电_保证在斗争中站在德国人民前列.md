Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 23rd - According to TASS, Berlin: The Provisional People's Chamber and the Provisional Senate of the German Democratic Republic held plenary sessions on the 19th and 20th respectively, to discuss the congratulatory telegram from Stalin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, to President Pieck and Prime Minister Grotewohl of the German Democratic Republic. Both meetings unanimously passed resolutions expressing deep gratitude to Stalin and guaranteeing to stand at the forefront of the German people in the struggle for peace.

The resolution of the People's Chamber pointed out that this telegram "marks a turning point in history and further confirms the Soviet Union's friendship with the German people. It reflects the Soviet government's determination to extend a hand of friendship to fight together for peace and to defend the German people, who bear a heavy guilt for launching an attack on the Soviet Union. The Soviet government's determination, as seen in the Soviet telegram, is that as long as the peoples of the two countries demonstrate determination to fight for peace as hard as they did during the war, then peace in Europe can be considered guaranteed. This prompts the German people to fight for peace more vigorously than ever before. The members of the Provisional People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic solemnly guarantee to stand at the forefront of the German people in carrying out these tasks. They guarantee to make every possible effort to unite all forces within the German Democratic Republic to defend and consolidate peace with an iron will. They therefore urge the German people in the Western Zones to wage a common struggle for the unity of Germany and for peace."

The resolution unanimously adopted by the Provisional Senate pointed out: "Marshal Stalin's congratulatory telegram directly to the President and Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic is also addressed to all Germans, especially those holding responsible positions in the German Democratic Republic." "Stalin's great congratulatory telegram opens up a great future for the peace-loving, democratic German people, and it opens the door to peaceful cooperation with all peace-loving peoples. This telegram appeals to the best sentiments of our people, expressing deep conviction that the German people will use all the strength hitherto wasted in engaging in war to cooperate with the Soviet Union and all other peace-loving people in the world to fight for the cause of peace." The Provisional Senate requests the great Soviet statesman to accept this friendly assurance, that the entire Senate and each of its members, as representatives of the people, will make every effort to prove by action that the trust expressed in the congratulatory telegram is justified.

　　德议会与参议院一致决议
  　深深感谢斯大林贺电
    保证在斗争中站在德国人民前列
    【新华社北京二十三日电】据塔斯社柏林讯：德意志民主共和国临时人民议会与临时参议院于十九、二十日先后举行全体会议，讨论苏联部长会议主席斯大林致德意志民主共和国皮克总统与格罗提渥总理的贺电。两个会议都一致通过决议，向斯大林表示深深的感谢，并保证在为和平而进行的斗争中，站在德国人民的前列。
    人民议会的决议指出：这一贺电“标帜了历史的转折点，并更进一步地证实了苏联对德国人民的友谊。它反映了苏联政府的决心伸出友谊之手，为和平、为保卫德国人民——他们因对苏联发动攻击而负有重罪——而共同奋斗。苏联政府的决心，见之于苏联的贺电中，只要这两国人民表现决心为和平而战，象他们在战争时那样努力，那末，和平在欧洲可以认为有了保证，这促使德国人民较迄今任何时候更为大力地为和平而斗争。德意志民主共和国临时人民议会的议员们庄严保证，在执行这些任务时站在德国人民的前列。他们保证尽一切可能的努力，使联合在德意志民主共和国内的各种力量，以钢铁般的意志保卫并巩固和平。他们因此敦促西区的德国人民为争取德国的统一和争取和平而进行共同的斗争”。
    临时参议院一致通过的决议指出：“斯大林大元帅直接给德意志民主共和国总统和总理的贺电，同时也是给一切德国人首先是那些担任德意志民主共和国负责职位的人的。”“斯大林的伟大贺电，向爱好和平的、民主的德国人民开辟了伟大的将来，它打开了与一切爱好和平的人民和平合作之门。这个贺电向我国人民的最优良的情绪呼吁，表示深信德国人民将运用迄今为止浪费在从事战争的全部力量，来与苏联及世界上一切其他爱好和平的人民合作，为和平事业而斗争。”临时参议院要求伟大的苏联政治家接受这个友好的保证，即整个议会以及它的每个议员，均将作为人民的代表，尽一切努力以行动证明在该贺电中表示的信任是有理由的。
