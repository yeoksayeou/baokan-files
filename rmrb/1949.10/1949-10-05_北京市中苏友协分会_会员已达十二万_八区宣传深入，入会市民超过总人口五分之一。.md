[Beijing News] Since the establishment of the preparatory committee of the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, the work of developing membership has formed a mass movement. As of yesterday (the 4th), 110 units, totaling over 120,000 people, have registered as members of the association. Among them, 19 units are workers, including 5,440 from the Beijing-Tianjin Railway Bureau, 3,000 from the Clothing Factory, and over 26,000 from other factories. 54 units are students, including 6,622 from the Revolutionary University, 1,895 from Peking University, 958 from Women's No. 3 Middle School, 957 from the Women's Affiliated High School of the Normal University, and over 27,000 from other units. 24 units are cadres and staff of government agencies, including 1,050 from the Public Security Bureau, 5,317 from the Beijing Municipal Government, and over 36,000 from other units. 12 units are people from various districts, totaling over 35,000 people. There are over 5,000 primary and secondary school teachers and staff. In the process of developing membership, in addition to government agencies and schools, 14,500 citizens in the Eighth District have voluntarily signed up as members, accounting for over 21% of the district's population. A branch preparatory committee has now been established. In the work of developing membership, citizens are enthusiastically requesting to join the association. Zhu Xiangchen, a partner at Meixing Electrical Appliance Store, said, "The Soviet Union is our elder brother, and we should learn from the Soviet Union in everything." The success in developing membership in this district is mainly due to three reasons: (1) When conveying the August People's Representative Conference, propaganda on Sino-Soviet friendship was integrated. The trade union office held forums by industry and explained the issue of Sino-Soviet friendship in workers' night schools. On the other hand, cadres from the Public Security Sub-bureau and the District Office organized propaganda teams, using police stations as units, to hold small-scale citizen forums in the evenings, answering questions and concerns from the masses and refuting the Kuomintang's reactionary rumors. (2) Progressive citizens, neighborhood leaders, and activists played a leading role. After listening to the report by Xing Xiangsheng, the head of the Public Security Sub-bureau, 90% of them signed up as members and went back to mobilize the masses. (3) Cadres attached importance to this work and promoted it with great enthusiasm.

The preparatory committee plans to convene a standing committee meeting in the coming days to discuss the formal establishment of the branch in the near future, and hopes that all units currently developing membership will promptly return the filled registration forms to facilitate the work.

    现筹委会拟于日内召开常委会，商讨最近期内正式成立分会事宜，并希正在发展会员的各单位，速将已填的登记表送回，以利工作。
