　　Peking University Professors Zheng Xin and Others Jointly Published a Congratulatory Letter
　　Paying Respects to Chairman Mao, Resolutely Supporting the Three Major Documents of the CPPCC, and Striving to Build a New Democratic Culture
　　[This newspaper dispatch] National Peking University professors Zheng Xin and nine others, jointly published a congratulatory letter on September 27th, paying respects to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and all the representatives of the CPPCC, expressing their resolute support for the three major documents and all resolutions of the CPPCC, and striving for their thorough realization. The original text is as follows: Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and all representatives of the CPPCC:

　　The convening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is a complete turnaround for the Chinese people, historically speaking, an unprecedented revolutionary victory in five thousand years, opening a new era in the history of the Chinese people; from a global perspective, a quarter of humanity has since broken free from enslavement, stood up, and started building their own new society and new country; domestically, it is an unprecedented national unity of the people; internationally, it is the addition of a strong reinforcement to the staunch bulwark of peace. This is the first and most glorious great victory we, all the people, have gained under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, which has resolutely fought and unyieldingly opened a bright path for the people, especially under the wise leadership of the great people's leader Chairman Mao.

　　Amidst our joy and excitement, we hereby send this brief letter to congratulate and salute you. And we hereby guarantee:

　　We will always support the leadership of the working class, always follow the Communist Party, and always take Mao Zedong Thought as our lighthouse.

　　We will certainly engage in national construction work in our respective positions, resolutely support the three major documents and all resolutions of the CPPCC, and strive for their thorough realization.

　　We will certainly, under the spirit of internationalist new patriotism, learn all the cultural achievements of the Soviet Union, urge ourselves to make continuous progress, and strive to engage in the construction of new democratic culture and education, so that the upsurge of cultural construction predicted by Chairman Mao will come quickly, so that we will quickly become a nation with a high level of culture, raise the cultural level of all working people, and catch up with the advanced socialist and new democratic countries.

　　Respectfully wishing you victory and success!

　　[Another dispatch] Ji Xianlin and twenty-five other teachers from the Department of Oriental Languages ​​of National Peking University recently jointly wrote a letter to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and all representatives of the CPPCC to congratulate them on the founding of the People's Republic of China, and expressed their full support for the three major documents of the CPPCC, especially the decision on ethnic policies. The original text is as follows: Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and all representatives of the CPPCC:

　　The CPPCC has opened, and the People's Republic of China has been founded. This indicates that the Chinese people will forever be their own masters, and Chinese history will move in a new direction that is absolutely different from the past. We are now celebrating with unparalleled enthusiasm.

　　The more than 600 representatives who participated in the CPPCC represent different professions, different social strata, and also represent different religious beliefs and different ethnic groups. They naturally view the Organizational Law of the CPPCC, the Organizational Law of the Central People's Government, and the Common Program of the CPPCC from different standpoints and perspectives; but they unanimously expressed their warm support for these three major documents, which proves that these three major documents can truly represent the demands of the broad masses of people throughout the country. We are determined to support these three major documents with action!

　　We all study Oriental languages. The teachers and students in our department come from different ethnic groups and have different beliefs. What we are most concerned about is of course the ethnic issue. The Common Program clearly stipulates ethnic policies, stipulating that all ethnic groups within the People's Republic of China are equal, implement mutual unity, oppose previous great Han chauvinism and narrow nationalism, prohibit discrimination between ethnic groups, and that all ethnic minorities have the freedom to develop their languages and writing, maintain or reform their customs and religious beliefs. We unanimously believe that this regulation is completely correct and completely reasonable, and we must especially support this correct policy with action!

　　We pay our highest respect to the great people's leader Chairman Mao. We will always advance under his banner! Teachers of the Department of Oriental Languages, Peking University

　　Ji Xianlin, Jin Peng, Zhang Liping, Fu Youbi, Ma Xueliang, Yang Rongzhu, Li Qilie, Huang Minzhong, Wang Shiqing, Chang Ruiyi, Guo Yingde, Li Sen, Qin Senjie, Ling Ruigong, Chen Yan, Liu Linrui, Peng Zhengdu, Chen Yulong, Chen Ganxiang, Yuan Youli, Yin Hongyuan, Zhao Qizhu, Ma Chaoqun, Liu Deyu, Jin Kemu

    【又讯】国立北京大学东方语文学系季羡林等二十五位教员顷联名向毛主席、朱总司令暨人民政协全体代表写信祝贺，庆祝中华人民共和国的成立，并表示完全拥护人民政协三大文件，特别是其中关于民族政策的决定。原文如下：毛主席、朱总司令暨人民政协全体代表先生：
    人民政协开幕了，中华人民共和国成立了，这表示中国人民将永远成为自己的主人，中国历史将走向一个同以前绝对不同的新的方向，我们现在用无比的热诚来庆祝。
    参加政协的六百多位代表，代表不同的职业，不同的社会阶层，还代表不同的宗教信仰，不同的民族，他们对人民政协组织法，中央人民政府组织法和人民政协共同纲领，当然也从不同的立场和观点上来看；但他们对这三大文件一致地表示热烈的拥护，这证明这三大文件真正可以代表全国广大人民的要求，我们决心用行动来拥护这三大文件！
    我们都是研究东方语文的，我们系里的教员和同学，有的民族不同，有的信仰不同，我们最关切的当然是民族问题，共同纲领里明确地规定了民族政策，规定了：中华人民共和国境内各民族一律平等，实行互相团结，反对以前的大民族主义和狭隘的民族主义，禁止民族间的歧视，各少数民族都有发展其语言，文字，保持或改革其风俗习惯及宗教信仰的自由。我们一致认为这规定完全正确，完全合理，我们更要特别地用行动来拥护这正确政策！
    对伟大的人民领袖毛主席我们致无上的敬意，我们永远在他的旗帜下前进！北京大学东方语文学系教员
