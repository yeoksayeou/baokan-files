　　Although this is only the fourth May Day celebrated after the anti-Hitler war, on this international day of unity, working people everywhere are once again faced with the urgent task of mobilizing all their strength to uphold peace.

　　It has only been four years since the fascist criminals and war-mongering gangs were smashed, but it is not difficult to glimpse, beneath the guise of the Atlantic Pact, the outlines of the old anti-communist pact, hastily remodeled under new Anglo-American leadership, but retaining all the old ideas, aims and methods.

　　The working people of the world, and the majority of mankind – the generation whose blood has not yet dried in the trenches, the mothers whose children have been orphaned, the youth who have grown up under the explosions of bombs and the poverty of life – all who remember the horrors of war, cannot allow the peace won at such a deeply painful price to be turned into a short-lived respite by the imperialists.

　　The Soviet Union is the first country in history to genuinely care about maintaining world peace. The Soviet Union's concern for maintaining lasting peace is also beneficial to the vast majority of mankind.

　　The Soviet Union's consistent foreign policy, its policy of defending peace, its policy of equality among all nations and national independence for countries large and small, is breaking all the conspiracies of the bellicose imperialists.

　　The Soviet Union resolutely tore to shreds the secret veil of bourgeois diplomats who concealed the true causes of war from the masses. The Soviet foreign policy, guided by Marxism, Leninism, and the brilliant leadership of Lenin and Stalin, implements a frank and open foreign policy against the old methods of bourgeois secret diplomatic conspiracies. It directly and unreservedly appeals to the masses of the world; and helps them understand the relations between countries, unite and organize to defend peace and the freedom of all peoples.

　　The Soviet Union's struggle to uphold peace continues to thwart the imperialists' plans to launch wars. The imperialists' sinister conspiracies are closely linked to their efforts to build an anti-Soviet aggression alliance; but each time, the Soviet Union thwarted these plans. The failure of the military intervention against the Soviet Republic by the imperialists of Germany, Britain, France, the United States, Japan and other countries from 1918 to 1920 is well known. The same fate befell the imperialists' anti-Soviet provocations from 1925 to 1927.

　　The Soviet Union's constantly growing strength, the ever-increasing support of its peace policy by the people of the whole world, the wisdom of this policy to exploit the contradictions between the imperialists for the benefit of peace – all these shattered the imperialists' attempts to launch a war. Thus, the outbreak of World War II was postponed for many years. When the fascist aggressors finally launched the war, their accomplices – the imperialists of the United States, Britain, France, etc. – could not form the united anti-Soviet front they had spent so much time trying to organize. Their armies were forced to cooperate with the Soviet army to fight the fascist aggressors, in accordance with the demands of the interests of all peoples. During the war, when the Western imperialists were sabotaging the opening of a second front, the people of all countries placed all their hopes on the Soviet Union, on the country that made tremendous sacrifices to restore freedom and peace to the people of all countries as quickly as possible.

　　"If we do not seize every opportunity to accelerate the defeat of the enemy, we are committing a crime against our motherland, against the Soviet people who are temporarily under the yoke of fascism, and against the European peoples who are groaning under the heel of German tyranny," Comrade Stalin said on November 6, 1943.

　　The Soviet army smashed the German and Japanese aggressors, and as a result, mankind was able to obtain peace.

　　The imperialists, especially the American imperialists, who had obtained enormous profits during the war, wanted to preserve and increase these profits by preparing for a new war.

　　Failing to learn the lessons of history, the imperialists of the United States and Britain, following in Hitler's footsteps, are organizing another aggressive bloc to launch a new war to fight for world hegemony and eliminate the forces of democracy and progress. One of the main servants in this adventure is the right-wing socialists, as banker Harriman, the U.S. special envoy for the Marshall Plan in Europe, recently bluntly admitted. These people have been assigned the despicable task of crowning the American war-mongering monopolists with the laurels of "democracy" and "pacifism," praising the gold standard, and spreading filthy slanders about the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, attempting to split and undermine the workers' movement.

　　Recently, it has become difficult to distinguish the various factions of social democrats from the Tito clique of Yugoslav nationalists, because the latter are doing everything possible to serve the initiators of the Atlantic Pact, hindering Yugoslavia's alliance with the socialist front.

　　However, there is a wide gap between the imperialists' desire to launch a new war and the possibility of organizing it. Day by day, the Soviet Union's consistent struggle for lasting peace on democratic principles is strengthening the forces of the democratic and anti-imperialist camp, which is already much stronger than the forces of the war-mongers.

　　Thanks to the Soviet Union's multifaceted assistance, the people's democratic countries have been able to break the imperialists' economic and political conspiracies, and have achieved major successes in developing their economies along socialist lines.

　　The recently established Council for Mutual Economic Assistance is an excellent manifestation of the relations between the people's democratic countries and the Soviet Union; it is a model of cooperation and mutual assistance on the basis of full equality between friendly countries.

　　Relentlessly exposing the war-mongers, such as Churchill and the American imperialists; exposing the aggressive nature of the Atlantic Pact, while at the same time putting forward practical proposals to strengthen peace; the Soviet Union is leading the people of all countries in this struggle to uphold peace.

　　Marshal Stalin's reply to Wallace's letter, Marshal Stalin's proposal in his reply to Smith's letter, the Soviet Union's proposal for the Soviet Union and the United States to conclude a peace treaty; the Soviet Union's proposal to reduce the armaments of the major powers by one-third within a year, to abolish atomic bombs and to control atomic energy; the Warsaw Conference of the Eight Foreign Ministers' proposal to establish a unified and democratic Germany, so that it would no longer be a threat to peace in Europe – all these examples of the Soviet Union's peace policy expressed the will of the people of all countries to uphold peace, and were a powerful blow to the war-mongers.

　　Using their mechanical vassal states, the United States and Britain are undermining the United Nations. But despite this situation, the Soviet Union's powerful voice resounds from the platform of the United Nations: Defend peace and the freedom of all peoples! The Soviet Union's position in the United Nations in defending the people of Greece and Spain, China and Indonesia, Vietnam and South Africa, Palestine and Libya has inspired the people of those countries to fight against imperialism, has helped to expand the anti-imperialist camp, and has strengthened its unity.

　　But with the help of the national bourgeoisie, who have already betrayed their countries, and the right-wing socialists, the American imperialists are propagating the poisonous ideas of nationalism and cosmopolitanism to cover up their plans for aggressive expansion.

　　Striking at the ideology of imperialism, the Soviet people, with their Soviet culture, are giving progressive, peace-loving humanity a great example of a world view that combines ardent patriotism with internationalism, combines love for the motherland with brotherly affection for the working people of all nations, and respects the rights and traditions of every nation, large or small.

　　This world view strengthens and inspires the true champions of peace and the patriots of all countries to fight for peace and national independence. When Comrade Stalin's voice, the voice most loved by the people of all countries, resounds, the friends of peace all over the world see their path and purpose even more clearly. Hundreds of millions of working people in Europe and the Americas, and even on the distant islands of the Pacific, rightly regard Comrade Stalin as their teacher and defender, and send out their voices demanding peace and freedom. Both friends and enemies have recognized the irrefutable truth of Stalin's words, the indivisible unity of his words and actions, and the scientifically accurate of his foresight.

　　Stalin's famous words: The prediction of "the ignominious defeat of the instigators of a new war" has become the fighting banner of the champions of peace.

　　Today, the people of all countries can thwart the imperialists' war plans. This is clearly visible if we compare today's situation with the situation on the eve of the First World War.

　　After launching the First World War, the imperialists were able to deceive the people of all countries and use them as cannon fodder for their plundering plans. They were able to do this because the workers' movement throughout the world, with the exception of Russia, was dominated by the right-wing socialists, the obedient servants and traitors of imperialism. In Russia, the proletariat was led by a truly revolutionary party, a truly anti-imperialist party, where imperialism suffered a defeat of world historical significance. The Great October Socialist Revolution, the emergence of the Soviet Union and its continuous strengthening, and the emergence and development of the communist parties of all countries – all this shook the foundations of imperialism.

　　Using the split in the workers' movement caused by the right-wing socialists, the imperialists were able to launch the Second World War. As early as 1934, Comrade Stalin warned the imperialists that a war against the Soviet Union "would be the most dangerous war for the bourgeoisie. It would be the most dangerous war, not only because the peoples of the Soviet Union would fight to the death to preserve the gains of the revolution; it would be the most dangerous war for the bourgeoisie also for another reason, namely that it would be fought not only at the front, but also in the rear of the enemy. The bourgeoisie need not doubt that the majority of the Soviet Union's friends in Europe and in Asia will do their utmost to strike at the back of their oppressors. And let the bourgeois gentlemen not blame us if some of the governments they hold dear and cherish, who are today ruling happily 'by the grace of God', disappear tomorrow after such a war."

　　The fascist aggressors and the imperialist groups that supported them ignored this warning. But with mathematical accuracy, Comrade Stalin's diagnosis became a reality.

　　Today, when the American imperialists are preparing for a third world war and stirring up war frenzy, moral factors must play a very important role, along with the already greatly increased material strength of the Soviet Union, and along with the powerful anti-imperialist camp. This decisive moral factor is the recognition of the Soviet Union's leading position in the anti-imperialist struggle, in the struggle to uphold peace. Through painful, but invaluable experience, the people of all countries have recognized the truth that the victory in the struggle for peace, for national independence, against imperialist plunder and annexation, for freedom and the implementation of this struggle, can only be achieved by following the Soviet Union, by cooperating with it, and by cooperating with the entire anti-imperialist camp led by it. Everywhere, the communist and workers' parties, loyal to proletarian internationalism, are making this clearer and clearer to the masses of the people. Everywhere, the communist and workers' parties are striking at nationalism, the meaning of which, as we know from the example of the Tito clique, is to abandon the cause of peace and betray the interests of their people.

　　The consistent position of proletarian internationalism can be seen in the struggle to uphold peace that is being waged by the working people of the Romanian People's Republic and other people's democratic countries. Under the leadership of the Romanian Workers' Party, our People's Republic is actively defending peace; it is fighting to eliminate the exploitation of man by man and to build socialism. At the same time, the people declare their firm determination to defend with arms the independence of their motherland, their peaceful construction work, and their democratic gains, should the imperialists launch an armed attack on the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries; should such an attack occur, they will fight to the death, as only a free people can. They will fight alongside the invincible Soviet army.

　　Thorez, Togliatti, Pollitt and other leaders of the communist parties have warned the imperialists that if they dare to violate peace and attack the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, they will have to take into account the people of the Western countries, who will welcome the Soviet army as an army that liberates the people of all countries, and will cooperate with it to defeat the American imperialists and drive them out of the borders of the people's countries. The great Chinese people have declared to the world through Mao Zedong that should there be imperialist aggression, they will fight alongside the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries.

　　The instigators of imperialist war have never faced such a bleak future as they do today. The anti-imperialist forces have never been as strong and united as they are today. The people have never had so many methods and means to push away the sword of Damocles of war. (Damocles, a figure in ancient Greek mythology, had a sword suspended by a single hair over his head during a banquet. "The Sword of Damocles" means an imminent disaster that can occur at any time – translator.)

　　The champions of peace, united around the Soviet Union and led by it, represent a powerful fortress. And they will be victorious in defending peace!

### 苏联领导拥护和平的斗争

　　苏联领导拥护和平的斗争
    罗马尼亚工人党、中央委员会书记安娜·鲍克著
    这虽然不过是反希特勒战争后被庆祝的第四个五一节，可是在这个国际团结的日子，各地的劳动人民又面临了动员一切力量为拥护和平而斗争的紧急任务。
    自从法西斯罪犯与战争贩子的匪帮被打碎以后，只不过过了四年，但是不难在大西洋公约的掩饰之下窥见旧的反共公约的轮廓，它是在新的英美领导之下匆促改制的，但是保存着所有旧的思想、目的与方法。
    世界的劳动人民，以及大多数人类——在战壕里其血尚未干的一代人，其儿女成了孤儿的母亲们，在炸弹的爆炸与生活的贫乏之下生长起来的青年——所有记得战争的恐怖的人，不能让由付了这样创痛巨深的代价所赢得的和平叫帝国主义者转变为短时的喘息。
    苏联是真正关心维持世界和平的历史上第一个国家。苏联所关心的持久和平的维持对于绝大多数的人类也是有利的。
    苏联的一贯的外交政策，它的保卫和平的政策，各民族平等与大小国家民族独立的政策，正在打破好战的帝国主义者的一切阴谋。
    苏联把资产阶级外交家对群众隐瞒战争的真正原因的秘密面幕，坚决地撕成碎片。为马克思、列宁主义与列宁和斯大林的光辉领导所指引的苏联外交政策，针对着资产阶级秘密外交阴谋的古老方法，实行坦白与公开的外交政策，它直接并毫无保留地诉诸世界的群众；并帮助他们了解各国家间的关系，团结并组织起来以保卫和平及各国人民的自由。
    苏联拥护和平的斗争，继续不断地挫败帝国主义者发动战争的计划。帝国主义者的罪恶阴谋，同他们建立反对苏联侵略联盟的努力，是密切地联系着的；但是，每一次，苏联挫败了这些计划。一九一八年至二○年德、英、法、美、日等国的帝国主义者反对苏维埃共和国的军事干涉的失败是尽人皆知的。同样的命运临到了帝国主义者在一九二五年至二七年的反苏挑衅。
    苏联之不断增长的实力，全世界人民对它的和平政策之日见增加的支持，能够为和平的利益利用帝国主义者间的矛盾的这一政策的明智——所有这些，打破了帝国主义者发动战争的企图。这样第二次世界战争的爆发被向后推移了多年。当法西斯侵略者终于发动了战争时，他们的帮凶——美、英、法等国的帝国主义者——就不能形成他们花了那样多时间企图组织的联合反苏阵线。他们的军队被迫协同苏联的军队对法西斯侵略者作战，以符合各国人民利益的要求。在战争期间，当西方帝国主义者正破坏第二战场的开辟时，各国人民把他们所有的希望寄托于苏联，寄托于作了惨重的牺牲以尽速恢复自由与和平给各国人民的国家。
    “我们若不利用一切机会加速敌人的失败，我们就是犯着反对我们的祖国的罪恶，反对暂时倒在法西斯羁轭之下的苏维埃人民的罪恶，并反对呻吟于德国暴政脚踵之下的欧洲各国人民的罪恶，”斯大林同志在一九四三年十一月六日说。
    苏联军队打碎了德国与日本的侵略者，结果人类得以得到和平。
    帝国主义者，特别是美国帝国主义者，在战争期间获得了庞大的利润，想借准备新战争保存并增加这些利润。
    不能了解历史的教训，美国与英国的帝国主义者，追踪着希特勒的脚步，正组织另一个侵略集团，俾发动一次新的战争，以争取世界霸权并消灭民主与进步的力量。他们的这一冒险中的主要仆从之一是右翼社会党人，如马歇尔计划驻欧洲特使银行家哈里曼最近毫不客气地承认。这些人被指派了这种可鄙的任务，即给美国贩卖战争的垄断资本家戴上“民主主义”与“和平主义”的桂冠，赞扬金圆，并散布关于苏联与人民民主国家的污浊的诽谤，企图分裂并破坏工人阶级运动。
    近来已经难于分辨各派系的社会民主党人与南斯拉夫的民族主义的铁托集团，因为后者正在尽一切可能侍奉大西洋公约的发起者，妨害了南斯拉夫与社会主义的阵线的联盟。
    但是，在帝国主义者发动新战争的欲望与组织此项战争的可能之间，有着一条宽广的鸿沟。日复一日，苏联争取在民主原则上的持久和平的一贯斗争，正在加强民主与反帝阵营的力量，这一阵营的力量已经比战争贩子们的力量强大得多了。
    感谢苏联多方面的援助，各人民民主国家能够打破帝国主义者的经济与政治阴谋，并在沿着社会主义路线发展它们在经济上，达成重大的成功。
    最近成立的经济互助委员会，是各人民民主国家与苏联之间关系的一个优良表现；这是在友好国家充分平等基础上合作与互助的一个模范。
    无情地揭露战争贩子，例如邱吉尔与美国帝国主义者；揭露大西洋公约的侵略性质，同时并提出实际的建议以加强和平；苏联正在领导着各国人民进行着这一拥护和平的斗争。
    斯大林大元帅给华莱士的信的答复，斯大林大元帅在他给史密斯的信的答复中所作的，苏联与美国缔订和平公约的建议；苏联所作于一年内裁减列强军备三分之一，取消原子弹并管制原子能的建议；八国外长华沙会议所作建立统一与民主的德国，使它不再是对欧洲和平的危胁的建议——苏联和平政策的所有这些事例都表达了各国人民拥护和平的意志，且是对战争贩子们的一个有力打击。
    用它们的机械般的附庸国的多数，美国与英国正在破坏联合国。但是虽有这种情形，苏联的强大的呼声却从联合国的讲坛响出来：保卫和平与各国人民的自由！苏联在联合国保卫希腊与西班牙、中国与印尼、越南与南非、巴勒斯坦与利比亚的人民的立场，已经激励了各该国人民反对帝国主义的斗争，已经帮助扩大了反帝国主义的阵营，并已经加强了它的团结。
    但借着已经叛卖了他们的国家的民族资产阶级，与右翼社会党人的帮助，美国帝国主义者正在宣传民族主义与世界主义的有毒思想，以掩饰他们的侵略的扩张的计划。
    打击帝国主义的思想，苏联人民以其苏维埃文化正在给进步的、爱和平的人类以一个世界观的伟大范例，此项世界观把热烈的爱国主义与国际主义结合，把爱祖国与对所有民族的劳动人民之兄弟般的情感结合，并与尊重无论大小每一民族的权利与传统结合起来了。
    这一世界观加强并激励了和平之真正的拥护者与各国的爱国者为和平与民族独立的斗争。当斯大林同志的呼声，各国人民最喜欢听的呼声，响出来的时候，全世界和平的朋友们看见他们的道路与目的便更加清楚。欧洲与美洲，甚至太平洋中辽远的岛屿上的百千万劳动人民，正当地认为斯大林同志是他们的导师与保卫者，发出他们要求和平与自由的呼声。无论朋友或敌人都已认识到斯大林的话之颠扑不破的真理，他的语言与行动之不可分解的一致，他的预见之科学的准确。
    斯大林的著名的话：预言“新战争挑拨者之不名誉的失败”，已经成为和平的拥护者的战斗的旗帜。
    今天各国人民能够挫败帝国主义者的战争计划。若是把今天的局势与第一次世界战争前夕的局势加以比较，这是显然可见的。
    在发动第一次世界战争以后，帝国主义者能够欺骗各国人民，利用他们作为他们掠夺计划的炮灰。他们能够这样作，因为全世界的工人阶级运动，除俄国以外，是被帝国主义顺从的奴仆，叛卖者，右翼社会党人所支配。在俄国，无产阶级为一个真正革命的党所领导，为一个真正反帝国主义的党所领导，在那里帝国主义遭遇了有世界历史意义的失败。伟大十月社会主义革命，苏联的产生及它的继续不断的加强，各国共产党的产生与发展——这一切都动摇了帝国主义的基础。
    利用右翼社会党人所造成的工人阶级运动的分裂，帝国主义能够发动第二次世界战争。早在一九三四年，斯大林同志警告帝国主义者，说反对苏联的战争“将是对资产阶级最危险的战争。它将是最危险的战争，不仅因为苏联各族人民将拚死作战以保存革命的收获；它将是对资产阶级最危险的战争，也因为另一个理由，就是它不仅在前方打，而且在敌人的后方打。资产阶级无需怀疑，苏联劳动人民在欧洲与在亚洲的多数朋友将尽他们最高的努力在他们的压迫者的背后予以打击。并且让资产阶级老爷们不要怪罪我们，如果他们所亲近宝爱的一些政府，今天‘以上帝的恩典’快活地统治着，在这样一次战争以后到明天就不见了。”
    法西斯侵略者与支持他们的帝国主义集团，不理睬这一警告。但用数学般的准确斯大林同志的诊断变成了现实。
    今天，当美国帝国主义者正在准备第三次世界战争并在鼓动起战争热狂的时候，道德的因素一定要扮演一个非常重要的角色，连同已经巨大增长的苏联的物质力量，并连同强有力的反帝国主义的阵营。这个具有决定性的道德的因素就是认识苏联在反帝国主义的斗争中，在拥护和平的斗争中的领导地位。由于痛苦，然而是无价的经验，各国人民认识了这个真理，就是争取和平、争取民族独立、反对帝国主义掠夺与吞并，争取自由之胜利与贯彻这一斗争，只有伴随苏联去作、协同它去作、并协同它所领导的整个反帝国主义阵营去作。在各地方，共产党与工人党，忠于无产阶级的国际主义，正在把这一点向人民大众说明得日益清楚。在各地方，共产党与工人党正在打击民族主义，我们由铁托集团的事例知道民族主义的意义就是放弃和平的事业并叛卖他们的人民的利益。
    无产阶级国际主义的一贯立场，可以由罗马尼亚人民共和国和其他人民民主国家的劳动人民所正在作的拥护和平的斗争看到。在罗马尼亚工人党领导之下，我们的人民共合国正在积极地保卫和平；它正在战斗以取消人对人的剥削并建设社会主义。同时，人民宣布他们的坚固的决心，要手执武器保卫他们的祖国的独立，他们的和平建设工作和他们的民主的收获，倘遇有帝国主义对苏联及各新民主国家实行武装攻击的时候；倘遇有此项攻击，他们将作生死的斗争，如只有一个自由的民族所能作的那样。他们将伴随不可战胜的苏联军队作战。
    多列士、托格里亚蒂、波立特及其他共产党的领袖们已经警告帝国主义者，说他们若敢于侵犯和平并攻击苏联与各人民民主国家，他们将必须顾及西方各国的人民，他们将欢迎苏联的军队，以它为解放各国人民的军队，并将与它协同作战，以打败美国帝国主义者并驱逐他们出人民的国境。伟大的中国人民已经通过毛泽东向世界宣布，说倘遇有帝国主义的侵略，他们将伴随苏联及各人民民主国家作战。
    帝国主义战争的挑拨者向来没有象今天面临着这样一个惨淡的未来。反帝国主义的力量向来没有象今天这样强大与团结。人民向来没有象今天有这样多的方法与手段推开达摩克里斯的战争的剑。（达摩克里斯，古希腊神话中的人物，在他宴饮时他头上空以一根头发悬着一把剑。“达摩克里斯的剑”意即迫在眉睫，随时可以发生的灾难——译者。）
    团结在苏联的周围并由它领导的和平的拥护者，代表一个强有力的堡垒。并且他们在保卫和平上将会胜利！
    （唐人译自一九四九年五月一日“争取持久和平与人民民主”。）
