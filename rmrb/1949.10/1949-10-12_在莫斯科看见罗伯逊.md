Seeing Robeson in Moscow
    Chinese Workers Delegation Zhou Ming
    The Chinese Workers Delegation first arrived in Moscow and stayed at the International Hotel facing the Kremlin. On June 10th, we were having lunch in the restaurant. Across the long table, at another table, we spotted a black man in a white checkered seersucker suit sitting there seriously. We curiously looked at this uncommon person—a kind and honest black face, thick lips; his bright and passionate eyes also looked at our group from time to time. A cordial feeling was exchanged between us, as if we had already discovered a deep friendship.
    The dishes were served, and we only focused on lowering our heads, using the unfamiliar knives and forks.
    "Ding ding ding ding..." Comrade Ning Yi gently tapped the wine glass with a knife, signaling us to pay attention. I looked up and saw that the black man had already come to our table. He smiled and shook hands warmly with the comrades. Comrade Ning Yi introduced to us:
    "Comrades: This is the American song king, Robeson!" We immediately stood up and applauded enthusiastically, and he also applauded.
    "He participated in the World Congress of Supporters of Peace held in Prague, and sang many songs at the congress!... He uses songs to oppose the new war conspiracy of imperialism." Comrade Ning Yi continued to introduce him, and we couldn't help but applaud enthusiastically again, welcoming this international friend. So he sat with us at the table like a close brother, eating and talking enthusiastically.
    Soon, he stood up during the meal and spoke in English, which Comrade Ji translated into Chinese:
    "I am very honored today to be able to see friends from the new China in Moscow, to see the heroic Chinese people, the delegation of the victorious Chinese working class. First of all, I extend my cordial greetings to my friends." He raised his glass, "To the health of Mao Zedong, cheers!" We all stood up, filled our glasses, and raised them to him in gratitude, "Cheers!" He also said: "I am very happy today and would like to sing a few Chinese songs here!" After a burst of enthusiastic applause, he began to sing the majestic "March of the Volunteers."
    We could only understand him when he spoke after the translation, but when he sang, the sounds and words were very clear. The atmosphere in the restaurant changed from excitement to solemnity with his singing. In the end, the majestic sound moved us to tears. We could only use enthusiastic applause to welcome his singing, and he smiled and nodded to us constantly...
    Before he finished his meal, he stood up and shook hands with Comrade Ning Yi to say goodbye. He said, "I still have things to do in the afternoon!" Comrade Milan, who was hosting us, said, "Tomorrow night (June 11th) at eight o'clock there will be a grand music evening with more than 30,000 people at Gorky Park to welcome this black singer from America!"
    The next day, Comrade Milan bought us the admission tickets, and at half past seven, we took an open-top bus to Gorky Park. The people attending the concert were very crowded, but it was impossible to tell whether they were workers, staff, college students, men or women. Some brought their own binoculars, and there were also children.
    As soon as the time came, the crowds surged into the concert hall. The open-air venue with more than 30,000 people was packed. The mercury lights shone on the stage, and for a moment, applause and cheers sounded like thunder. The people sitting down all stood up. Robeson, wearing a blue suit, walked to the front of the stage, constantly clapping. Children with flowers swarmed the stage from both sides, and cheers and applause rang out, shaking the night sky of Gorky Park. Some took out their hats and towels, raised them high, and waved to him in cheers.
    After the orchestra played the Soviet national anthem, Robeson sang amidst the applause of 30,000 people. The venue immediately quieted down, without a sound. Only his voice in front of the microphone spread into the eardrums of the more than 30,000 listeners. The voice of the American people sang freely in Moscow! The voice of the American people resisting the oppression of the bourgeoisie sang out! Once was not enough! Twice was not enough, more than 30,000 people unanimously asked him to sing again. Each song was sung at least twice! Three times! After he finished singing, he ran behind the curtain five times, and was welcomed out five more times by cheers and applause! He also sang famous Soviet songs, "Serenade," "Nightingale Song," "Volga River," and "Fatherland March." Flowers piled up in front of him, and he constantly clapped his hands to thank the cheering and applauding people.
    The Soviet people used such warm feelings to welcome this singing king from America—Robeson, who freely sang in Moscow; but in the United States under imperialist rule, the American people's song king—Robeson, could not freely sing in his own country, and was instead persecuted and attacked by thugs!
    We shouted: "Robeson, welcome to sing in the free New China."

　　在莫斯科看见罗伯逊
    中国职工代表团  周明
    中国职工代表团初到莫斯科，是住在面向克里姆林宫的国际大旅社，六月十日，我们在餐厅吃午饭，长形的餐桌对面，另一餐桌上，我们发现一个穿白花格子泥的西装黑人严肃的坐在那里，我们好奇地看着这个不常见的人——，亲切而诚实的黑色脸孔，厚厚的嘴唇；他底光辉热情的眼光也不时向我们这一群看望，我们之间一股亲切的感情在交流着，我们互相之间，好象已经发现深厚的友谊似的。
    菜，上了桌，我们只顾低着头，使用着那不习惯的刀叉。
    “叮叮叮叮……”宁一同志用刀子轻轻的敲了几下酒盅，是告诉我们注意，我抬头一看，那位黑人已经走到我们餐桌这边来了，他笑着与同志们热烈握着手，宁一同志向我们介绍：
    “同志们：这就是美国的歌王罗伯逊！”我们立刻站起来，热烈的拍掌，他也拍掌。
    “他参加了在布拉格召开的世界拥护和平大会，在大会上唱了很多歌！……他用歌声来反对帝国主义新的战争阴谋。”宁一同志继续介绍，我们不禁又拍起了一阵热烈的掌声，欢迎这位国际友人。于是他就和我们一同坐在餐桌上象亲兄弟一样地一面吃饭，一面热情地交谈着。
    不久，他在席间站起来，用英语说话了，计同志译成中国话：
    “我今天很荣幸，在莫斯科这地方，能够看到新中国的朋友们，看到英勇的中国人民，胜利的中国工人阶级的代表团，我首先向朋友们致亲切慰问，”他举起了酒盅“为毛泽东健康干一杯！”我们都站了起来倒满了酒，高举着向他表示感谢“干杯！”他又说：“今天我很高兴，愿意在这里唱几个中国歌！”一阵热烈欢迎的掌声过后，他就歌唱起雄壮的“义勇军进行曲”来。
    他说话的时候是要经过翻译我们才懂，但他歌唱时，声音词句却非常的清楚。餐厅里随着他的歌唱由热烈转到严肃，最后雄壮的声音感动得我们流出热泪，我们只有用热烈的鼓掌来欢迎他的歌唱，他笑着不断地向我们点着头……
    饭没有吃完他站起来，向宁一同志握手告别了，他说“还有事要在下午办！”招待我们的米兰同志说：“明天晚（六月十一日）八点钟在高尔基公园有一个三万多人盛大的音乐晚会，来欢迎这位来自美国的黑人歌手！”
    第二天米兰同志把我们入场门票买好，七点半钟坐无头的大汽车到高尔基公园。参加音乐会的人很拥挤，但看不出是工人或是职员、大学生男的女的，有的自带着望远镜，也有小孩。
    时间一到，人流向音乐会会场涌进去了，三万多人的露天会场，坐得满满的，水银灯光照射在舞台上，一时掌声、欢呼声似打雷一样响起来了，坐着的人们全都站起来了，罗伯逊穿着一身青色的西装走上了台前，不断地拍着掌，献花的孩子群由两边拥上了台，欢呼声、掌声响成了一片，震撼着高尔基公园的夜空，有的把帽子、手巾拿出高举着，向他招摇欢呼。
    在乐队演奏了苏联国歌以后，罗伯逊在三万人的掌声中歌唱了，会场即刻静下来，一点声音都没有，只有他的声音在麦克风前，传播在三万多听众的耳鼓里，美国人民的声音在莫斯科自由地歌唱了，美国人民受资产阶级压迫而反抗的声音歌唱出来了！唱一遍不行！唱两遍，不行，三万多人一致地要求他再唱，每一支歌至少都唱了两遍！三遍！他唱完了跑进幕后五次，又被欢呼声、掌声欢迎出来五次！他也唱了苏联的名歌，“小夜曲”，“夜莺曲”，“伏尔加河”，“祖国进行曲”，鲜花堆满了他面前，他不断地拍手向欢呼拍掌的人们感谢。
    苏联的人民是用这样热烈感情来欢迎这位来自美国的歌王——罗伯逊，自由地在莫斯科歌唱；但在帝国主义统治下的美国，美国人民歌王——罗伯逊，却不能自由地在自己的国土上歌唱，反遭到暴徒的迫害和袭击！
    我们高呼：“罗伯逊，欢迎你到自由的新中国来歌唱。”
