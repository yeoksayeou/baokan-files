    [This newspaper's report] The Beijing Seventy Arsenal Workers' Union recently issued a written statement protesting the American Wald's violence in beating workers in Shenyang. The statement said: "We, all the employees of the Beijing Seventy Arsenal, protest the atrocity of the American Wald. He disregards the law and dares to withhold workers' wages and gather people to beat workers. This is the barbaric atrocity of American imperialism. In addition to expressing our condolences to our brothers, we demand that the Chinese working class unite to seriously protest Wald's barbaric behavior. On the territory of our People's Republic of China, such shameless behavior of imperialists is not allowed. We are determined to support the injured Chinese workers with action and demand that the government severely punish the culprit Wald according to law!"
    [Another news] All the students of the Beijing Railway Management Institute of Jiaotong University recently issued a statement protesting the American Wald's gathering of people to brutally beat Chinese workers. The statement said: Under our people's democratic power, the American Wald in Shenyang dared to gather people to brutally beat our Chinese workers. This is an extremely serious act of violence. The shameful behavior of Wald and other thugs is intolerable to the people of the whole country. All of us students are extremely angry after hearing this news. We firmly support the measures taken by the Shenyang People's Government to handle this case in order to safeguard the laws and regulations of our People's Republic of China and protect human rights. We demand that the Shenyang People's Government must severely punish the murderer.
