　　The Situation of Turkish Rural Areas
    By Gulevich, Translated by Li Qiao
    Turkey is a backward agricultural country, with more than 80 percent of its population—18 million people—being farmers. Turkey's exports are mainly agricultural products, which form the basis of its economy.

    During the period from 1919 to 1922, when the Turkish people, relying on the just assistance of the Soviet Union, fought for their national independence, the Turkish ruling groups spared no effort in making various promises. Farmers were declared "masters of the country," and it was said that "the plow is the pen that writes Turkish history."

    However, not a single promise was fulfilled. These promises were deceptive tactics towards the broad masses. The bourgeoisie and landlords remained the all-powerful masters of the country, and no labor or agricultural issues were resolved. Even the slightest hope of Turkish workers, farmers, and tenant farmers to improve their situation was ruthlessly suppressed. Comrade Stalin pointed out as early as 1927:

    "The Kemalist revolution is a national commercial bourgeois revolution from above, which developed in the struggle against imperialism, and its tendency of development, in practice, is against the workers and peasants, against the possibility of land reform."

    Turkish farmers did not receive land; of the 23 million hectares of arable land, only 7-8 million hectares were cultivated. The majority of these cultivated lands are in the hands of landlords and rich peasants. They rely on hired laborers to cultivate the land or lease it to tenant farmers under extremely harsh "halving" conditions. "Halving" means that the tenant farmer has to give half of their harvest to the landlord, and sometimes the rent even exceeds the harvest amount.

    According to incomplete materials from a long time ago, there were only 3,300 large landlords in Turkey. Landlords and rich peasants concentrated more than 80 percent of the country's land area in their hands. The Turkish government is implementing a policy of developing and consolidating the rich peasant economy and landlord estates. For example, in the Hetikeia county of Ekin province, 12,000 hectares of land belong to fifteen landlords. The vast majority of farmers are landless. In the Rize and Trabzon districts, farmer families of seven to ten people only have one hectare of land; such situations are common everywhere.

    Landlords and rich peasants can obtain loans from banks and agricultural cooperatives, but farmers not only lack land but also lack means of production. As the Turkish "Millet" newspaper pointed out, out of 1,413,000 extremely simple agricultural production tools in Turkey, only 15,711 are modern. Farmers use wooden plows to cultivate the land. In the fields, one can often see oxen slowly pulling the plow, with the farmer closely following behind, sometimes accompanied by a family member to help the oxen pull the plow. There are only 1,065 tractors in the whole of Turkey, and even these tractors are only found on the farms of landlords. Landlords do not think it is necessary to use tractors; it is more profitable for them to rely on hired laborers to cultivate the land and carry out production, and it is precisely here that hired laborers are subjected to unprecedentedly cruel exploitation.

    There are about 250,000 hired laborers in total, and their labor is very cheap, with no legal protection. Hired laborers are completely in the hands of landlords and rich peasants; even the incomplete "Labor Law" promulgated in 1936 has special clauses stating that the Labor Law does not include hired laborers, as well as sailors on merchant ships and workers in enterprises with fewer than ten people.

    Ninety percent of Turkish hired laborers are illiterate, and the remainder can barely write their names. One Turkish economist had to admit that "the lives of these hired laborers are no different from the lives of primitive people." They work from morning till night, eat what others throw away, suffer from hunger and starvation, earn very little money, and wear tattered clothes. Hired laborers are in such an unbearable situation that many Turkish newspapers have to talk about this issue.

    For example, the Istanbul "Yeni Sabah" newspaper published a dispatch describing the impressions gained from visiting the vast olive planting area of Ayvalik district.

    "What shocked me the most was the situation of the women who pick olives," the author wrote, "Here, the main labor force is girls aged thirteen to eighteen, who bring two months' worth of food—dry rations—from distant places. Each person picks half a sack of olives a day. They work all day bent over, and their bodies ache from the excessive labor...Even so, they are given almost no pay."

    Turkish hired laborers and day laborers do not have organizations to defend their rights. Just as workers in other departments do not have trade unions, there are no trade unions for agricultural workers either. Social insurance is nowhere to be seen. In this situation, sickness benefits and holiday pay are naturally not available to Turkish agricultural workers. When hired laborers are on the verge of death, they walk from one landlord's farm to another.

    The Turkish "Cumhuriyet" newspaper published an interview with an agricultural worker:

    "What do you do if you get sick?" the reporter asked.

    "If we get sick, we wait for it to get better, or we die."

    "Does no one want to call a doctor to see you?"

    "They do, but rarely. Some people only call a doctor when they are about to die. If there is a drought, we wait to starve; if it rains, we get malaria. We are always born without midwives, and when we are sick, we wait to die without doctors, and after death, we have no place to be buried."

    Although the talk of land reform in Turkey in 1945 was a sensation for a while, hired laborers knew that it was impossible to get land under the current domestic situation. In reality, land reform was a shameless deception of farmers and hired laborers. Land reform stipulated the prepayment of large amounts of redemption money, stipulated a very long time, and still maintained the property of the landlords. Land reform was never put into practice. It is very obvious that no landlord in Turkey is willing to give even a very small piece of his land to landless farmers and hired laborers. With no way out, hired laborers and farmers finally spontaneously rose up to distribute the landlords' land. As a result, the entire apparatus of the landlord and bourgeois state—the police, gendarmes, and courts—was mobilized. The land was returned to the landlords, and the farmers and hired laborers were thrown into prison.

    Turkish hired laborers, who are constantly in a state of displacement, clearly see that the vast majority of them are deprived of the opportunity to start a family. The "Ekin Sabah" newspaper published a report recording an interview between a reporter and a hired laborer. This hired laborer expressed his sadness at not being able to afford to marry a wife for himself, because marrying a wife costs five hundred to one thousand lira (the Turkish currency unit), a number that is too large for a hired laborer who can only earn fifteen to twenty lira a month! This report not only illustrates the painful fate of hired laborers but also illustrates the powerless status of women, who are to be sold.

    Turkish hired laborers have to pay thirty kinds of heavy taxes and levies. A considerable portion of the money also ends up in the pockets of the so-called "foremen," called "Kausa" in Turkish, who deduct a "reward" for finding work for the hired laborers from their wages.

    Turkish hired laborers are economically powerless and completely politically powerless. According to the Turkish constitution, "Anyone who can read Turkish and has resided in a place for more than one year is eligible to vote." These restrictions deprive hired laborers of the right to participate in elections.

    American aid has further worsened the lives of hired laborers. As a result of American imperialist aggression, the cultivated area of Turkish economic crops has decreased, with tobacco cultivation being one of them. Turkey's tobacco market in West Germany has been cut off, and the market is now filled with American goods.

    As a result, so-called "Yerganders" (Note 1) have appeared on the streets of Turkey; they are farmers and hired laborers who have drifted into the city to find work and wait to be hired. They lie on the roadside surrounded by tattered cotton quilts—called Yergan in Turkish.

    The "currency reform" implemented in 1946, which benefited American monopoly capitalists, has further worsened the lives of farmers and hired laborers. The prices of the most important necessities of life in the country are rising day by day, and heavy taxes have also increased. In order to step up military preparations, Turkey's military expenditure accounts for the bulk of the national budget and all American loans. The Turkish government has raised the price of sugar. The Turkish Finance Minister shamelessly claimed that, in his opinion, "raising the price of sugar will not reduce the need for sugar among farmers and agricultural workers, because they rarely needed sugar before."

    Farmers and agricultural workers, already in despair due to hunger and poverty, hold demonstrations to protest. Demonstrators in a certain place unveiled such slogans: "We want to hope to build a country that can turn swamps into fertile fields (Note 2), we don't want a country that makes lemonade!" "Turkey is an agricultural country, we demand an agricultural budget of 150 million lira."

    The demands of Turkish farmers and hired laborers are correct. According to the total budget of 1,411.5 million lira for 1949, the agricultural budget only accounts for 39 million lira, while the expenditure for the army is 499.5 million lira, and the expenditure for the gendarmerie and police is 89 million lira. There are thousands of police stations and gendarmerie teams in Turkey, but there are almost no agricultural institutes and agricultural schools.

    Now, Turkish democrats are fighting to eliminate poverty and the reactionary bourgeois and landlord autocracy.

### 土耳其农村的状况

　　土耳其农村的状况
    古列维赤  著  李樵  译
    土耳其是一个落后的农业国，这个国家的人口百分之八十以上——为数一千八百万人——都是农民。土耳其的输出主要的是农产品，农产品是她底经济基础。
    一九一九年到一九二二年当土耳其人民依靠苏联底正义援助，为本国的独立而进行斗争时，土耳其的统治集团当时不惜发出各种各样的诺言。农民被宣布为“国家底主人”、曾说过什么“犁——就是写成土耳其历史的笔”。
    然而，一个诺言都没有被履行过。这些诺言都是对广大群众的欺骗手段。资产阶级和地主们仍然是国家的全权主人，任何工、农问题都没有得到解决。土耳其的工人、农民、雇农为改善自己处境的极其微小的希望也被无情地镇压下去了。斯大林同志远在一九二七年就指出过：
    “基马尔革命是上层的民族商业资产阶级革命，这个革命是在反对帝国主义斗争中发展起来的，它发展下去的倾向，实际上是反对工、农，反对土地改革之可能性。”
    土耳其的农民们没有得到土地，在两千三百万公顷的适于播种的土地中只有七、八百万公顷是开垦地。这些开垦地底大部分是掌握在地主富农底手中。他们靠雇农来耕种土地，或者是在极其刻薄的条件下“对分制”出租给佃农。“对分制”就是佃农要把自己收获的一半缴给地主，有时地租甚至超过收获量。
    根据很久以前不完全的材料，在土耳其只有三千三百个大地主。在地主、富农的手中集中了全国土地面积的百分之八十以上。土耳其政府实行着发展和巩固富农经济及地主庄园的政策。例如在埃金省底盍得热畿亚县里，有一万二千顷土地属于十五个地主。而农民底绝大多数是没有土地的。在利泽和特拉别兹乌德区，七口人到十口人的农民家庭只有一公顷土地，这样的情况，到处皆是。
    地主富农在银行、农业合作社里都能获得贷款，而农民不只没有土地，也没有生产工具。恰如土耳其“米尔特”报所指出的，土耳其一百四十一万三千件极其简单的农业生产工具之中，只有一万五千七百一十一件是近代化的。农民用木犁耕地。在田野里经常可以看见牡牛曳着犁慢腾腾地走着，农夫紧跟在后面，有时携同家里的某个人一块儿来帮助牛拉犁。全土耳其一共只有一千零六十五架拖拉机，就是这些拖拉机也只有在地主的农场里才有。地主们认为不需要使用拖拉机，靠雇农来耕种土地和进行生产对他们说来是更为有利，也正是在这里雇农遭受到闻所未闻的残酷的剥削。
    雇农总共约有二十五万人左右，他们的劳动力是非常低廉的，劳动得不到任何法律上的保障。雇农完全是掌握在地主、富农的手里，甚至在一九三六年所颁布的残缺不全的“劳工法”里也附有特殊的条文，即劳工法不包括雇农在内，以及商船的水手和不足十人的企业工人也不包括在内。
    土耳其雇农百分之九十都是文盲，而余下的人也只能勉强地写写自己的名字而已。土耳其的一个经济学者也不得不承认“这些雇农的生活同原始人底生活并没有区别”。他们从早到晚地工作，而他们吃的是别人所扔掉的东西，受饥挨饿，劳动所得又是极少的几文钱，穿的褴褛不堪。雇农是处于如此难以忍受的境遇，以致于连土耳其的许多报纸也不得不谈及这个问题了。
    如君士坦丁堡的“冶尼·萨巴哈”报登载了一篇通讯，这篇通讯是描绘游览广阔的橄榄栽植地爱瓦雷克区所得的印象。
    “最使我惊惑的是采集橄榄果的妇女们的情况，——笔者写道——在这里主要的劳动力是十三岁到十八岁的女孩子，她们带着两个月的粮食——干粮——从遥远的地方走到这里，每人每天采集半口袋橄榄果，她们整日弯着腰工作，她们睡在车棚里，由于过重的劳动使她们周身疼痛……。即便如此，几乎任何报酬都不给她们。”
    土耳其的雇农、短工没有保卫他们权利底组织。如其他部门的工人没有职工会一样地农业工人底职工会也是不存在的。社会保险连影子也看不到。在这种情形下，疾病补助金、假期工资土耳其底农业工人那当然是得不到的。当雇农们频于死亡的时候，他们就徒步地从一个地主的农场转向另一个农场去。
    土耳其“德汝姆呼里耶特”报刊载了一篇与农业工人底谈话：
    ——假如你们病了可怎么办呢？——记者问道。
    ——我们生了病，我们就等着病好，不然就是死掉。
    ——难道谁都不愿请医生给看一看吗？
    ——请倒是请，那是很少的。有的人当他快死的时候才去请医生。要是国内旱荒，我们就等着挨饿；如果下雨，我们就生疟疾。我们从来都是没有产婆就出生的，没有医生病了等死，死后又无葬身之地。
    虽然一九四五年在土耳其土地改革之说曾轰动一时，但雇农们知道，处在现在的国内情况分得土地是不可能的。实际上土地改革是对农民和雇农的一种无耻的欺骗。土地改革规定要预缴大量的赎金，土地改革曾规定了很长的时间，且仍保持了地主的财产，土地改革终究也没有见诸实行过。这很显然的，土耳其的任何一个地主都不肯把自己很小很小的一块土地交给无地的农民和雇农。雇农和农民们走头无路终于自动地起来分配了主地的土地。这一来，地主、资产阶级的国家底整个机构—警察、宪兵、法院—都出动了。土地仍退还给地主，而农民和雇农则被关进了监狱。
    土耳其的雇农，经常处于颠沛流离的状况之下，很清楚地看到，他们之中的绝大多数是被剥夺了成家的机会。“埃金·萨巴哈”报登载了一篇报导，在这篇报导里是记载记者与一个雇农的谈话。这个雇农为他自己娶不起老婆而表示伤感，因为娶一个老婆要花五百到一千里拉（土耳其的货币单位），这个数目字对一个每月只能赚十五个到二十个里拉的雇农说来是太庞大了！这篇报导不只说明了雇农痛苦的命运，而且也说明了妇女底没有权利的地位，妇女是要被出卖的。
    土耳其的雇农要缴纳三十种苛捐杂税。不少一部分钱还要落到所谓“把头”底腰包里，土耳其语称这些把头为“卡乌萨”，“卡乌萨”要从雇农的工资中扣除为他找工作的“报酬”。
    土耳其的雇农是经济上的无权加上政治上的完全无权。根据土耳其宪法的规定“凡能阅读土耳其文，并在一地居留一年以上者，方得有选举权。”这些限制便剥夺了雇农参加选举的权利。
    美国的援助更加使雇农的生活趋于恶化。美国帝国主义侵略的结果，使土耳其经济作物的耕种面积减少了，烟草的耕种就是其一。土耳其在西德的烟草市场被断绝了，那里现在美货充斥着市场。
    于是在土耳其的街头出现了所谓“耶尔甘德热”（注一），他们是流落到城市里来找工作的和等待受雇的农民和雇农。他们围着破烂不堪的棉被——土耳其语叫做耶尔甘——躺在路旁。
    一九四六年所实行的有利于美国垄断资本家的“币制改革”使农民、雇农的生活更加恶化。国内最重要的生活必需品的价格日益上涨，苛重的捐税也提高了。为了加紧军备，土耳其的军备支出占国家预算的大部及美国的全部贷款。土耳其政府提高了糖的价格。土耳其财政部长厚颜无耻地声称，照他的意见“提高糖的价格是不会降低农民和农业工人糖的需要的。因为他们在这以前也很少需要糖的”。
    已经陷于绝望的饥饿和贫困的农民、农业工人们举行游行示威以示反抗，某地的游行示威者们揭出了这样的标语：“我们要希望建立一个能使沼泽变良出的国家（注二），我们不要制造柠檬汁的国家！”“土耳其是农业国，我们要求有一万万五千万里拉的农业预算。”
    土耳其的农民、雇农的要求是对的，按一九四九年的总预算十四万万一千五百万里拉，农业预算只占三千九百万里拉，用于军队的支出是四万万九千五百万里拉，用于宪兵和警察的支出则为八千九百万里拉。土耳其有几千个警察所和宪兵队，但是农业所和农业学校几乎一个也没有。
    现在土耳其的民主人士正在为消灭贫困和反动的资产阶级、地主的专制制度而斗争着。
