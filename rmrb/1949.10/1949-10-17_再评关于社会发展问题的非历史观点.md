　　Re-Critique of Unhistorical Views on Social Development Issues
    Ai Siqi
    Editor's Note: After Comrade Ai Siqi published "Critique of Several Unhistorical Views on Social Development Issues" in the Peiping Liberation Daily on July 26th, our newspaper received a manuscript from reader Ye Yimin, expressing opinions on Comrade Ai Siqi's article. The article "Re-Critique of Unhistorical Views on Social Development Issues" published in the second issue of "Study" magazine is Comrade Ai Siqi's response. We are reprinting it to inform our readers.

    After the Peiping Liberation Daily published "Critique of Several Unhistorical Views on Social Development Issues," the newspaper soon received an article from Ye Yimin, defending Lan Sha and completely supporting unhistorical viewpoints. The appearance of this article proves that in the current process of studying the history of social development, the fallacious ideas like those of Lan Sha are indeed not an isolated problem, and our criticism of such ideas is practically necessary.

    Based on Ye Yimin's article, some issues still need further criticism.

    First, let's talk about the "theme" of learning. The main purpose of learning "From Ape to Man" is not just to acquire some knowledge of biological evolution, but to understand "how labor created man," to establish the "labor viewpoint of labor creating the world," and to expose all past exploitative class viewpoints that looked down on labor and workers and peasants. That is to say, to "break down old viewpoints and establish new labor viewpoints." There is naturally nothing wrong with defining our "theme" in this way. But the question lies in how to establish "new labor viewpoints," how to answer this theme? On this question, there are two diametrically opposed methods: one is to take the Marxist-Leninist theory of historical materialism and the scientific knowledge of the laws of social development as the foundation to establish the labor viewpoint and to answer the theme; the other is not to seriously study Marxist-Leninist theory and the scientific knowledge of the laws of social development, but to be satisfied with generally and abstractly talking about a lot of nouns related to "labor viewpoint," and to be satisfied with simply cursing everything old as "unreasonable." On this question of how to answer the "theme," Lan Sha and Ye Yimin stand on a completely opposite position from us. We advocate the former method of answering, while Lan Sha and Ye Yimin adopted the latter method of answering.

    Ye Yimin said: "If we do not pay attention to these objective conditions and our target audience, and indulge in empty talk about academics, or want to guide readers to a more specialized discussion and research of social development history (especially ancient history), on the contrary, it would be detached from reality." Why can't we talk about "academics" if we want to establish a labor viewpoint? There are also two kinds of academics: if it refers to the bookish dogmas in general bourgeois universities, we must resolutely oppose it, because this kind of "academics" can never help us establish a "labor viewpoint," but on the contrary, will only guide us away from the "labor viewpoint" and consolidate the "exploitation viewpoint." However, if it refers to Marxist-Leninist theory and the scientific knowledge of the laws of social development, that is another kind of "academics," that is the "academics" we must talk about. Because this kind of "academics" is the foundation for "establishing new labor viewpoints," without seriously talking about this kind of "academics," we cannot truly understand why it must be "labor creates the world," and definitely not God, ghosts and gods, emperors and generals, the exploiting class, etc. that create the world; without seriously talking about this kind of academics, we cannot understand why the exploiting class has always maintained the position of rulers for thousands of years, and only today can the working people overthrow this rule and organize themselves into rulers in order to further eliminate all exploiting classes. Without seriously talking about this kind of academics, the so-called "breaking down old viewpoints and establishing new labor viewpoints" is just empty talk!

    Old viewpoints are the result of the long-term influence of the ideology of the exploiting class in the old society. It has its special distorted views on world history and human society as its foundation, and anti-Marxist-Leninist "academics" that defend the interests of the exploiters as its foundation. To "break down old viewpoints," it is necessary to grasp Marxist-Leninist "academics" and systematically overthrow this old "academics." It is impossible to solve the problem by simply talking about some slogans and nouns. The reason why many people's minds are currently filled with various exploitative ideas and muddled ideas is because too little or no attention has been paid to Marxist-Leninist "academics," and they cannot answer the various questions raised by the old viewpoints. If it is not heroes who create the situation, why have emperors, kings, generals, and ministers been able to flaunt their power over the working people for thousands of years? To answer such a basic question, it is necessary to talk about some "academics" and understand some Marxist-Leninist historical viewpoints in order to give a powerful answer. Therefore, we must now welcome more discussion of Marxist-Leninist "academics," and we must never reject it as "empty talk" and reject it. Studying the history of social development, studying "From Ape to Man," is not for any other reason, but only to improve our Marxist-Leninist "academic" level—or theoretical knowledge level—so that we have the ability to answer the various questions raised by the old viewpoints.

    It is true that the study of Marxist-Leninist theory must "be in line with reality," or more correctly, must be connected with reality. But what does it mean to be connected with reality? It means that Marxist-Leninist theory must be used to solve current practical problems. This requires first understanding the theory, and then we can talk about connection. Saying that the purpose of studying from ape to man is to break down many people's old exploitative viewpoints and establish new labor viewpoints is only raising a current practical problem, but has not yet solved this problem; to solve this problem, we must master the Marxist-Leninist theoretical knowledge about how the working masses create history, and we must understand the laws of social development. Is it called "being detached from reality" to strive to master theoretical knowledge in order to solve the current practical problems? If this is also called "being detached from reality," as Ye Yimin said, then wouldn't it mean that simply being satisfied with raising the problem, but not mastering the theory to solve the problem, is considered "being in line with reality"? We must resolutely oppose such a frivolous attitude towards theory and reality. We must know that to solve practical problems, we must understand the various laws related to this problem, that is, we must master the theory in order to have an in-depth understanding of the problem and solve it. Of course, Ye Yimin will defend himself by saying: "I am not opposed to studying theory, I am only opposed to involving the entire history of social development when discussing from ape to man." Because in his view, this is called "requiring too much, the scope is too large, and there are too many problems to be solved." Is it really that we "require too much, the scope is too large, and there are too many problems to be solved"? This depends on what our purpose of learning is. If our purpose of learning is only to obtain some knowledge of biological evolution of "how apes become humans," then naturally there is no need and should not involve the laws of the entire social development. If we are not satisfied with this, but want to "break down old viewpoints and establish new labor viewpoints" as a result, then if you do not allow people to touch on the issue of the laws of the entire social development in the discussion at all, it is like you asking people to walk into the house, but tightly closing the door, which is absurd. Ye Yimin is the person who put forward such an absurd proposition. Like Lan Sha, he admits that the purpose of learning is, "importantly, not to learn the history of biological evolution, but to learn the labor viewpoint, to understand that labor created man, labor created the world, created human wealth and culture, combined with one's own thoughts, criticized the exploitative consciousness that despises oneself and despises labor, combined with today's realistic needs, to highly promote labor enthusiasm, and stand on one's own work崗位to strive to build a new democratic China." He admits that the requirements of learning are so high, the scope is so large, and there are so many problems to be solved, but he does not allow people to go beyond the scope of knowledge of "how apes become humans" to find theoretical weapons! If someone does not obey his prohibition and slightly exceeds the scope of "how apes become humans," he will be given a long list of accusations, saying: "This is the result of the dogmatic ideological method of not looking at the problem, not looking at the object, and not looking at the objective and subjective actual situation!"

    What strange logic this is!

    Of course, when learning "From Ape to Man," it is impossible to discuss in detail all the laws of social development history. However, since the goal we are pointing to involves "building a new democratic China" from "establishing a labor viewpoint," why shouldn't we appropriately present the Marxist-Leninist general historical viewpoint on human society in the discussion according to the necessary degree, so that it is possible to solve the problem and inspire readers to conduct further research and study? We believe that this should be done completely, and this is exactly what we have done. The Liberation Daily also did not oppose doing so. The Liberation Daily's publication of the article criticizing Lan Sha is a clear proof. Ye Yimin said that this is not what the Liberation Daily "wants" and "can" do, which is just a subjective, far-fetched reason, and does not really pay attention to what he calls "objective conditions." Saying that the "theoretical level, time and energy" of the "target audience" do not allow this to be done is also not a fact. Even if the reader's theoretical level is very low and the time and energy are very little, it is not such a terrible obstacle that they cannot accept more theoretical knowledge than "how apes become humans." Ye Yimin's statement underestimates the minds of our readers too much.

    In fact, although Ye Yimin defends Lan Sha with twelve points of meticulousness, Lan Sha himself does not respect the prohibition announced by Ye Yimin at all. When talking about the viewpoint that labor creates the world and opposing the "saying that God, Heaven, gods, and the essence of the sun and moon create humans," Lan Sha has already jumped out of the circle of "how apes become humans" and discussed the issue of the entire human social history, that is, the issue of the origin of religion and the relationship between religion and the exploiting class. Strange, why can't Ye Yimin see that Lan Sha also committed the "dogmatic ideological method of not looking at the problem, not looking at the object, and not looking at the objective and subjective actual situation"?

    In fact, there is nothing strange about this, because Ye Yimin's only purpose is to blindly defend Lan Sha's unhistorical viewpoint, so he doesn't care whether what he says makes sense in terms of reason or whether there are any logical contradictions. For example, on the one hand, he has to admit: Religious myths "are not fabricated by the exploiting class. Ai Siqi's statement itself is correct." After turning two or three corners, he dared to slap himself in the face and say: "In this way, saying that it is a lie deliberately fabricated by the exploiting class does not violate the historical materialistic viewpoint." Here, Ye Yimin's logic is: Religious myths are indeed "not fabricated by the exploiting class," but there is a person named Lan Sha in the world, and he has a privilege to say casually that religion is "a lie deliberately fabricated by the exploiting class" without being considered a mistake or violating the historical materialistic viewpoint! Why can Lan Sha gain such a privilege? According to Ye Yimin's wonderful reason, it is: "Lan Sha's article is not discussing the emergence or origin of religious myths." What does this mean? This means that as long as the theme of an article is not to discuss the emergence or origin of religion, then even if some words in it involving the emergence or origin of religion are wrong, it still cannot be considered a mistake!

    This is of course sophistry! This clumsy defense, of course, cannot cover up Lan Sha's fault. No matter how it is explained, saying that religious myths are deliberately fabricated by the exploiting class violates the Marxist-Leninist historical viewpoint and materialistic viewpoint. It is a fact that religious myths in class society are often used on a large scale and systematically by the exploiting class as spiritual weapons to oppress the working people. But this fact can only prove that religion is combined with the interests of the exploiting class under certain historical conditions, but cannot prove that religion itself is deliberately fabricated by the exploiting class. Because in addition to this fact, there are other facts: even the exploiting class, when it plays a progressive revolutionary role in history, often not only does not require the use of religion, but on the contrary, becomes anti-religious atheists. For example, the early slave-owner class in Greece and the bourgeoisie on the eve of the French Revolution both disseminated materialist ideas, and there were also materialist ideas of similar nature in ancient China. Why didn't these exploiting classes want to fabricate religious superstitions? Not only that, the same religion can be used by the exploiting class under certain conditions, and under other conditions, it can become a form of resistance against exploitation and oppression by the working people, such as the Taoism, Buddhism (such as the end of the Yuan Dynasty), and primitive Christianity (such as the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom) adopted by the Chinese peasant uprisings in the past dynasties. If the exploiting class fabricated religious superstition, why would it fabricate these to fight against itself? By citing these facts, the unhistorical and idealistic viewpoint supported by Lan Sha and Ye Yimin will immediately collapse!

    One of Ye Yimin's reasons for defending Lan Sha is that Lan Sha's article "only points out that it is wrong for some people to still believe in the ideas that God, gods, Heaven, and the essence of the sun and moon create humans today." The meaning is that although religious myths are not deliberately fabricated by the exploiting class, in the special circumstances of "today," there is no need to seriously adhere to this truth. Yes, not only is it wrong for people to believe in these ideas "today," but we must also say that it is also wrong for people to believe in these ideas yesterday, the day before yesterday, and even in primitive society, because religion is always the spiritual sigh and reverie of the people, and is "an illusory reflection of human affairs in the human mind." But wrong as it may be, the fact that people have long believed in it is a historical fact, and not only "some people still believe" today, but also tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, and even for a considerable period of time in the future, some people will inevitably believe it, precisely because religious superstition is not something subjectively fabricated by anyone, but a product of certain conditions of the people's life development. When the people's economic living standards have not developed to the necessary height, it is impossible to completely eliminate religious superstitious ideas. Therefore, when dealing with the issue of religious superstition, like any other issue, whether it is yesterday, today, or tomorrow, we must first have a correct historical viewpoint, and based on the correct viewpoint, adopt various appropriate and correct religious policies, so that religious superstition can gradually be eliminated under the implementation of correct policies.

    It is necessary to overthrow the exploiting class's dogma of "those who labor with their minds govern others, and those who labor with their strength are governed by others." We have explained this in the previous article criticizing Lan Sha. We oppose Lan Sha and Ye Yimin only because they abandoned Marxist-Leninist theory and were satisfied with the simple method of "cursing down," thinking that the problem could be solved by cursing a few times "this reactionary heresy!" "This is poisonous thought!" But things are not that simple. To truly overthrow the dogma of "those who labor with their minds govern others, and those who labor with their strength are governed by others" from the root, it is still necessary to talk a little about "academics" and prove, according to the materialist historical viewpoint, how the phenomenon of "those who labor with their minds govern others, and those who labor with their strength are governed by others" will inevitably be eliminated.

    The division and opposition between mental and physical labor is an inevitable phenomenon at a certain stage of human social development. And under certain conditions, it is indeed a "fact that is in line with the laws and has progressive significance." The reason why the exploiting class can establish the dogma of "those who labor with their minds govern others, and those who labor with their strength are governed by others" is because they have seized on this fact and exaggerated, distorted, and regarded it as absolutely unchangeable. Therefore, the most effective way to overthrow this dogma of the exploiting class is to point out the relativity of this fact, point out that it can only exist under certain historical conditions, and under other conditions, it will inevitably be eliminated. Is there any danger in letting readers know the truth that the division between mental and physical labor has progressiveness and rationality under certain historical conditions? Will it prevent them from rising up to oppose the dogma of the exploiting class? On the contrary, only in this way can readers be sober-minded and use the knowledge of the correct laws of social development to answer the sophistry of the exploiting class that distorts history. If the exploiters say: "Those who labor with their minds govern others, and those who labor with their strength are governed by others" is an eternal and unchanging principle, and our readers can confidently refute: "No, that is just a transitional phenomenon in a certain historical period." Is such a rebuttal more practical and powerful than simply talking about some cursing adjectives? Here, Ye Yimin once again expressed his distrustful attitude towards the readers' minds, fearing that the readers' "current level" is too low to accept these scientific truths. This is of course completely wrong. As long as they study with considerable humility, even the most ordinary reader will not have a worse ability to accept this kind of preliminary truth than Lan Sha and Ye Yimin.

    The era of "those who labor with their minds govern others, and those who labor with their strength are governed by others" is over. However, the phenomenon of the division between mental and physical labor still exists, and will need to continue to exist for a considerable period of time in the future. Even though it is "today's great revolutionary historical era," it is not something that can be eliminated immediately. This is also a fact that must be faced squarely and acknowledged from a historical perspective, and cannot be "cursed down" in a general way!

    We are not opposed to "cursing down" those exploiting classes that should be "cursed down," but only oppose cursing down "all" exploiting classes in a general way without looking at historical conditions. We can point out that all exploitative systems are not permanent and will be eliminated in the future, and the Party and the state are also not permanent and will be eliminated (as Chairman Mao pointed out in On People's Democratic Dictatorship). But this does not mean that in today's China, we should generally advocate "mobilizing the working people to eliminate classes and eliminate the system of man exploiting man," and generally say: "What is wrong with cursing down the exploitative system?" generally "pointing out that the exploitative system is bad" and "pointing out that the exploitative system is unreasonable." Just as we must affirm today that progressive parties and people's countries are good, reasonable, and cannot be "cursed down," because they are still necessary today, we must also affirmatively point out that national capitalism that is beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood is good, reasonable, and cannot be "cursed down" today, because today's China still needs to use its initiative and use the power of the state to protect it, so that it can be developed under the leadership of the state-owned economy. Of course, it is important that national capitalism must be led by the state-owned economy economically, and must be led by the working class and based on workers and peasants politically, and the bourgeoisie should not occupy a major position in the state power. But this still does not mean that we can generally "curse down" all exploitative systems and simply call them "unreasonable" and "bad." Because Lan Sha does not understand this historical truth, although he reluctantly mentioned in his article that "in today's China, we must first eliminate the enslavement and exploitation of the Chinese people by imperialism, bureaucratic capital, and feudal forces," he is still at a loss as to why we only advocate eliminating these three enemies today, and do not advocate eliminating all exploitative systems, and cannot say half a reason. Not only that, because his main idea is to generally "point out that all systems of man exploiting man and the exploiting class should be eliminated," and he has not talked at all about using a historical perspective to specifically understand that a certain exploitative system can be eliminated only under certain conditions, the spirit of his entire article is actually completely contradictory to these reluctantly mentioned fragments of New Democracy. This is precisely what Lan Sha himself is responsible for. What can Ye Yimin "this reader" do even if he pretends to be indignant and shouts that he "cannot be convinced" by Ai Siqi's criticism? I think that "the discussion of this issue" has not been of "great" "help" to Ye Yimin, as he himself said: he did not carefully examine "some of his past thoughts," and did not humbly think about what is called the Marxist-Leninist historical viewpoint, so he confusedly helped Lan Sha make such a strongly argued argument full of errors!

　　再评关于社会发展问题的非历史观点
    艾思奇
    编者按：艾思奇同志在七月二十六日北平解放报发表“评关于社会发展问题的若干非历史观点”一文后，本报曾接读者叶逸民来稿，对艾思奇同志文章提出意见。“学习”杂志第二期发表的“再评关于社会发展问题的非历史观点”文系艾思奇同志的答复。今特转载，以响读者。
    北平解放报发表了“评关于社会发展问题的若干非历史观点”之后，不久就接到报馆转来叶逸民写的一篇替蓝莎打抱不平的、完全拥护非历史观点的文章。这篇文章的出现，证明在目前学习社会发展史的过程中，象蓝莎那样的谬误思想的确不是一个个别问题，而我们对这种思想加以批评，是切合实际需要的。
    根据叶逸民的文章看来，有些问题还需要做进一步的批评。
    首先要谈一下学习的“主题”的问题。学习“从猿到人”，主要目的不是仅仅为了要获得一些生物进化的知识，而是要了解“劳动怎样创造了人”，是为要树立“劳动创造世界的劳动观点”，及揭穿一切过去轻视劳动与轻视工农的剥削阶级观点。也就是说，要“打破旧观点，建立新的劳动观点”。这样规定我们学习的“主题”，自然是没有什么不对的。但问题是在于，如何来建立“新的劳动观点”，如何解答这个主题？在这个问题上就有着两种正相反对的方法：一种是把马列主义的历史唯物主义理论、社会发展规律的科学知识作为基础，来建立的劳动观点，来解答这个主题；另一种是不去认真研究马列主义的理论、社会发展规律的知识，而以笼统抽象的讲述一大堆关于“劳动观点”的名词为满足，以简单的对一切旧观念骂一声“不合理”为满足。在这个如何解答“主题”的问题上，蓝莎、叶逸民就与我们站在完全相反的立场上。我们是主张前一种解答方法，蓝莎、叶逸民却采用了后一种解答方法。
    叶逸民说：“如果我们不注意到这些客观条件和我们的读者对象，而奢谈学术，或欲引导读者走到比较专门的社会发展史（特别是上古史）的讨论和研究，相反，倒是脱离实际的。”要建立劳动观点，为什么就一定不能谈“学术”呢？学术也有两种：如果那是指的一般资产阶级大学校里的书本教条，我们自然要坚决反对，因为这种“学术”决不能帮助我们建立“劳动观点”，而相反的只会引导我们远离“劳动观点”，并巩固“剥削观点”。但是，如果那是指的马列主义的理论，社会发展规律的科学知识，那就是另外的一种“学术”，那就是我们一定要谈的“学术”。因为这种“学术”正是“建立新的劳动观点”的基础，不认真谈一谈这种“学术”，我们就无从真正了解，为什么一定是“劳动创造世界”，而一定不是上帝鬼神、帝王将相、剥削阶级等等创造世界；不认真谈一谈这种学术，我们就不能了解，为什么几千年来剥削阶级总是保持着统治者的地位，只有到了今天，劳动人民才有可能推翻这种统治，并把自己组织成为统治者，以便进一步去消灭一切剥削阶级。不认真谈一谈这种学术，所谓“打破旧的观点，建立新的劳动观点”，就只是一些空话而已！
    旧的观点，是旧社会剥削阶级思想长期影响的结果，它有它特殊关于世界历史和人类社会的歪曲的看法作基础，和反马列主义的、为剥削者的利益辩护的“学术”作基础。要“打破旧的观点”，必须掌握马列主义的“学术”，有系统地来推翻这种旧的“学术”，单凭讲一些口号和名词，是不能解决问题的。目前许多人的头脑里之所以充满着各种剥削思想和糊涂思想，就是由于对马列主义的“学术”讲求得太少或完全没有讲求，不能回答旧的观点所提出来的各种问题。如果不是英雄创造时势，为什么几千年来帝、王、将、相能够在劳动人民头上耀武扬威呢？象这样一个起码的问题，就必须多少讲一些“学术”，了解一些马列主义的历史观点，才能够给以有力的回答。因此，我们现在就必须欢迎多谈马列主义的“学术”，决不能相反地把它当做“奢谈”而加以拒绝。学习社会发展史，学习“从猿到人”，并不是为了别的原因，而只是为要提高我们的马列主义“学术”水平——或理论知识水平，使我们有能力来回答由旧的观点所提出来的各种问题。
    不错，学习马列主义理论必须“切合实际”，或更正确的说，必须联系实际。但是，所谓联系实际，是什么意思？那就是说，要用马列主义的理论，来解决当前的实际问题。这就首先要领会了理论，然后才可以谈到联系，说学习从猿到人的目的是要打破许多人的旧的剥削观点，建立新的劳动观点，这仅仅是提出了当前的一个实际问题，还没有解决这个问题；要解决这个问题，必须掌握马列主义关于劳动群众如何创造历史的理论知识，必须了解社会发展的规律。为着解决当前的这种实际问题而来努力掌握理论知识，这叫做“脱离实际”吗？如果这也叫做“脱离实际”，如叶逸民所说的那样，那么，岂不是说，仅仅满足于提出问题，而不去掌握理论来解决问题，这就算是“切合实际”了？这样一种对待理论和对待实际的轻率态度，我们是要坚决反对的。要知道，要解决实际问题，必须认识与这问题有关的各种规律，也就是必须掌握理论，才有可能对问题作深入的了解，并给以解决。当然，叶逸民会替自己辩护说：“我并不反对学习理论，我只是反对在讨论从猿到人的时候，涉及整个社会发展史的问题。”因为在他看来，这就叫做“要求太高，范围过大，要解决的问题过多”。究竟是不是真的我们“要求太高，范围太大，要解决的问题太多”了呢？这就要看我们学习的目的如何。如果我们学习的目的仅仅是在于求得一些“猿如何变人”的生物进化知识，那自然就不需要也不应该涉及整个社会发展的规律，倘若我们不以此为满足，而要由此“打破旧的观点，建立新的劳动观点”，那么，如果你一点也不允许人在讨论中接触到整个社会发展规律的问题，那就等于你要求人走进屋子里去，却又紧紧的关闭着门一样的荒唐。叶逸民就是提出了这样一个十分荒唐的主张的人。他和蓝莎同样，承认学习的目的，“重要的不是学习生物进化史，而是要学习劳动观点，了解劳动创造了人，劳动创造世界，创造人类财富和文化，结合着自己的思想，批判轻视自己轻视劳动的剥削意识的观点，结合着今天的现实需要，去高度发扬劳动热情，站在自己的工作岗位上，努力建设新民主主义的新中国。”他承认了学习的要求是这样高，范围是这样大，要解决的问题是这样多，但却不允许人超出“猿怎样变为人”的知识范围之外去找理论的武器！如果有人不服从他的这一条禁令，多少超出了一点“猿怎样变为人”的范围，他就要给加上一大串的罪名，说：“这是不看问题，不看对象，不看主观客观的实际情况的教条主义思想方法的结果！”
    这是多么奇怪的逻辑！
    当然，在学习“从猿到人”的时候，不可能详细讨论全部社会发展史的规律问题。但是，既然我们所指向的目标，是由“建立劳动观点”一直牵涉到“建设新民主主义中国”，为什么就不应该在讨论当中按照必要的程度适当地把马列主义关于人类社会的一般历史观点提示出来，以便有可能解决问题，并启发读者作进一步的研究与学习呢？我们认为完全应该这样做，而且也正是这样做过了。解放报也并没有反对这样做，解放报发表了那篇批评蓝莎的文章，就是一个明证。叶逸民说这不是解放报“所欲”和“所能”做的事，那只是一种主观设想出来的强辩的理由，并不是真的注意到了他自己所谓的“客观条件”。说“读者对象”的“理论水平、时间精力”不允许这样做，也不是事实。读者的理论水平即使很低、时间精力即使很少，还不至于成为那样了不起的一个障碍，使得他们就不可能接受比“猿怎样变为人”更多的理论知识。象叶逸民那样的说法，是未免把我们的读者对象的头脑估计得太低了。
    其实，叶逸民虽然十二分体贴入微地替蓝莎辩护，而蓝莎自己却丝毫也没有尊重叶逸民所宣布的那条禁令，在谈到劳动创造世界的观点和反对“上帝、天、神、日月精华创造人的说法”的时候，蓝莎早已跳出了“猿怎样变为人”的圈子，讨论到整个人类社会历史的问题，也就是讨论到宗教的起源和宗教与剥削阶级的关系的问题了。奇怪，为什么叶逸民竟看不出蓝莎也犯了“不看问题了，不看对象，不看主观客观的实际情况的教条主义思想方法”呢？
    其实这也并没有什么奇怪，因为叶逸民的唯一目的，只在于盲目地替蓝莎的非历史观点作辩护，所以就顾不了自己说出来的话在道理上是否讲得通，在逻辑上有没有自相矛盾的地方了，例如他一方面不得不承认：宗教神话“不是剥削阶级的捏造。艾思奇这个说法本身是对的。”而转了两三道弯之后，他又居然敢于打自己一个耳光，说：“如此，说是剥削阶级故意捏造的谎言，也没有什么‘违背历史唯物观点’之处。”在这里，叶逸民的逻辑是：宗教神话固然“不是剥削阶级捏造的”，但世界上却有一个名叫蓝莎的人，他有一种特权，可以随便说宗教是“剥削阶级故意捏造的谎言”，而不能算做错误，不能算做“违背历史唯物观点”！为什么蓝莎竟能取得这样的特权呢？按照叶逸民的奇妙的理由就是：“蓝莎这篇文章不是讨论宗教神话的出现或起源问题。”这又是什么意思呢？这就是说：只要一篇文章的主题不在于讨论宗教的出现或起源，那么，即使里面有一些涉及宗教的出现或起源的话是说错了，也仍然不能把它算做错误！
    这当然是强词夺理！这种拙劣的辩护，当然掩盖不了蓝莎的过失。不管怎样解释，既然说宗教神话是剥削阶级故意的捏造，这就违反了马列主义的历史观点和唯物观点。宗教神话在阶级社会里常常被剥削阶级大模规地、有系统地使用作压迫劳动人民的精神武器，这是事实。但这事实只能证明宗教是在一定的历史条件之下与剥削阶级的利益相结合，而不能证明宗教本身就是剥削阶级故意捏造出来的东西。因为除了这一事实之外，还有其他的事实：即使是剥削阶级，当它在历史上起着进步的革命的作用的时候，它就往往不仅不要求利用宗教，而相反地，却成为反宗教的无神论者。例如希腊早期的奴隶主阶级和法国大革命前夜的资产阶级，都曾传播过唯物论的思想，中国古代也有同类性质的唯物论思想。为什么这些剥削阶级又不要捏造宗教迷信了呢？不但如此，同一种宗教在一定条件下为剥削阶级所利用，在另外的条件下，又可以成为劳动人民反抗剥削和压迫的形式，如中国历代农民起义就采取过道教、佛教（如元末）、原始基督教（如太平天国）等等的形式。如果是剥削阶级捏造了宗教迷信，为什么它要捏造这些来后对自己呢？举出了这些事实，那么蓝莎叶逸民所拥护的非历史主义的、唯心主义的观点，就立刻垮台了！
    叶逸民为蓝莎辩护的理由之一，是说蓝莎的文章“仅是指出在今天尚有人相信上帝、神、天、日月精华创造人这些思想，是错误的”。意思是说，虽然宗教神话并不是剥削阶级故意捏造出来的，但在“今天”的特殊情形下，却不必认真坚持这个真理。是的，不仅“今天”人们相信这些思想，是错误的，我们还要说，就是昨天、前天一直到原始社会的人，相信这些思想，也同样是错误的，因为宗教始终是人民的精神上的叹息、梦呓，是“人的事物在人的头脑中的空幻的反映”。但错误尽管错误，人们曾长期相信它，却是一个历史的事实，而且不但今天“尚有人相信”，就是明天、后天、以至于相当长时期的将来，还免不了要有人相信，这恰恰因为宗教迷信并不是什么人主观捏造出来的东西，而是人民生活发展的一定条件的产物，在人民经济生活水平没有发展到必要的高度的时候，要想完全消灭宗教迷信思想，是不可能的。所以，对待宗教迷信问题，和任何其他问题一样，不管是昨天，今天或明天，我们都必须要首先有正确的历史观点，根据正确的观点，采取各种适当的正确的宗教政策，在正确政策的施行之下，才能使宗教迷信逐步归于消灭。
    要打倒剥削阶级关于“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”的教条，这是必要的，在前次批评蓝莎的文章中，我们就曾经说明过这一点。我们反对蓝莎叶逸民，只是由于他们抛开了马列主义的理论，满足于简单的“骂倒”的方法，以为只要咒几声“这个反动的邪说！”“这是有毒的思想！”问题就可以解决了。但事情并不是这样简单。要真正把“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”的教条从根本上打倒，还必须要多少讲一点“学术”，按照唯物论的历史观点，来证明“劳必者治人，劳力者治于人”的现象，如何会必然被消灭。
    劳心与劳力的分裂和对立，是人类社会发展一定阶段上的必然现象。而且在一定条件下的确是“合规律的、并且是具有进步意义”的事实。剥削阶级之所以能够建立起“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”的教条，就是由于抓着了这种事实，并把它夸大，歪曲，看做绝对不变的东西。所以，要打倒这剥削阶级的教条，真正最有力的办法，就是指出这种事实的相对性，指出它仅仅是在一定历史条件之下才能存在，而在另外的条件之下，就必然要归于消灭。让读者知道劳心与劳力的分裂在一定历史条件下具有进步性和合理性的真理，就会有什么危险，就会妨碍他们起来反对那剥削阶级的教条吗？恰恰相反，只有这样，才能使读者头脑清醒地、用正确的社会发展规律知识去回答剥削阶级曲解历史的诡辩。如果剥削者说：“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”是永久不变的天经地义”，而我们的读者就能有把握地反驳说：“不对，那只是一定历史时期的过渡的现象。”这样的反驳，不是比简单的讲一些咒骂的形容词更为切实和有力吗？叶逸民在这里又表示了他对于读者的头脑的不信任态度，害怕读者“现有水平”太低，接受不了这些科学真理。这当然是完全不对的。象这一类的初步真理，只要经过相当的虚心学习，即使是一个最普通的读者，其接受的能力至少也不会比蓝莎叶逸民更差。
    “劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”的时代是过去了。但是，劳心与劳力的分裂现象仍然存在着，而且在相当长时期的将来还需要继续存在下去。虽然是“今天这样伟大革命的历史时代”，还不是要立刻来消灭这一个分裂，这也是必须用历史观点来加以正视和承认的事实，并不是可以笼统一概“骂倒”的！
    我们并不反对“骂倒”那些该被“骂倒”的剥削阶级，只反对不看历史条件，笼统地骂倒“一切”剥削阶级。我们可以指出一切剥削制度都不是永久的，将来一定要被消灭，党和国家也一样不是永久的，一样要被消灭（正如毛主席在论人民民主专政里所指出的一样）。但这决不等于说在今天的中国就要笼统地主张“动员劳动人民起来消灭阶级消灭人剥削人制度”，笼统地说：“剥削制度有什么不可以骂倒？”笼统地“指出剥削制度不好”，“指出剥削制度不合理”。正如我们今天必须肯定主张进步的党派和人民的国家是好的、合理的、不能被“骂倒”的，因为它们今天还有存在的必要，同样，我们也要肯定地指出，有利于国计民生的民族资本主义，在今天是好的、合理的、不能被“骂倒”的，因为今天的中国还需要利用它的积极性，还要用国家的力量来保护它，使之能够在国营经济的领导之下得到相当的发展。当然，重要的是在经济上民族资本主义必须受国营经济的领导，在政治上必须以工人阶级为领导、以工农为主体，而不应当让资产阶级在国家政权中占主要地位，但这仍然不等于可以笼统地“骂倒”一切剥削制度，一概简单的称之为“不合理”的、“不好”的。蓝莎因为不懂得这一个历史主义的真理，所以他虽然在自己的文章里很勉强的提到“在今天的中国，就首先要消灭帝国主义，官僚资本及封建势力对于中国人民的奴役与剥削制度”，但对于为什么今天我们只主张消灭这三个敌人，而不主张消灭一切剥削制度，仍然是莫明其妙，说不出半点道理来。不但如此，因为他的主要思想是在于笼统地“指出一切人剥削人的制度，剥削阶级应当被消灭”，而一点也没有谈到要用历史观点来具体了解某种剥削制度要在某种条件之下才能被消灭，所以他全篇文章的精神在实际上是与这些勉强提到的新民主主义的片段词句完全矛盾的。这正是要蓝莎自己来负责，叶逸民“这个读者”虽然装出义愤填胸的样子大叫、大喊，说对于艾思奇的批评“不能心服口服”，又有什么办法呢？我看，“这一个问题的讨论”，对叶逸民的“帮助”，并不是象他自己所说的那样“很大”：他没有把自己“过去一些思想”很好的检讨一下，没有虚心地想一想什么叫做马列主义的历史观点，所以才会糊里糊涂地帮着蓝莎作了这样一场错误百出的强辩！
