Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 5th: The Inaugural Meeting of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters passed a message of salutations to Marshal Stalin. The text of the message is as follows:
Marshal Stalin:

The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, with members from all walks of life and all ethnic minorities in China, is holding its inaugural meeting in Beijing today. Our meeting unanimously decided to extend our warmest and most sincere respects to you – the great teacher and leader of the working people of the world!

The people of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the People's Republic of China have always had a deep and close friendship. The Chinese people still remember firmly: After the success of the October Revolution, the Soviet Union, under the leadership of the great Lenin and yourself, was the first to automatically abolish the unequal treaties concluded between Tsarist Russia and China; during the first Great Revolution of China from 1924 to 1927, the Soviet Union gave the Chinese people tremendous help; when Japanese fascism attacked China in 1937, the Soviet Union, under your leadership, was the first to provide China with tremendous material and spiritual assistance; and in 1945, it sent troops to the Northeast to eliminate the Japanese Kwantung Army and liberate our Northeast. In short, for thirty years, whenever China encountered foreign aggression, the Soviet Union never failed to express sincere sympathy and warm concern!

However, the reactionary rule of the Chinese Kuomintang in the past concealed the great friendship of the Soviet Union to the Chinese people and also suppressed the friendship of the Chinese people to the Soviet Union. The Chinese Kuomintang reactionaries, manipulated by foreign imperialism, directly became an obstacle to the friendly cooperation between the people of China and the Soviet Union.

Now, under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people, we have eliminated all obstacles to friendly cooperation between China and the Soviet Union. The Soviet government was the first to recognize our Central People's Government, further paving the way for close cooperation between China and the Soviet Union. From now on, there will be no obstacles to the sincere friendship and close cooperation between China and the Soviet Union. The people of China and the Soviet Union will forever join hands like brothers and work together to promote the happiness of the people of both countries and the democratic and lasting peace of the world!

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 5th: The Inaugural Meeting of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters passed a message of salutations to Chairman Mao Zedong. The text of the message is as follows:
Respected Chairman Mao:

The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association is holding a grand inaugural meeting in Beijing today. Our representatives present at the meeting, in view of the fact that the great friendship and help of the Soviet Union to China in the past has been concealed and distorted by the Kuomintang reactionaries, and the sincere friendship of the Chinese people to the Soviet Union has also been suppressed and ravaged by the Kuomintang reactionaries, it is precisely because you – our great leader and revolutionary teacher – have led us to eliminate all obstacles to friendly cooperation between China and the Soviet Union, that we can frankly express our sincere friendship to the Soviet Union. Our meeting unanimously decided to extend our most sincere respects to you!

We vow to follow you closely, to strive to enhance the friendly cooperation between China and the Soviet Union, to strive to promote the civilization and happiness of the people of China and the Soviet Union, and to strive for the democratic and lasting peace of the world!

The banner of Mao Zedong is the banner that guarantees our eternal victory!

　　中苏友好协会总会成立大会
    向斯大林大元帅、毛泽东主席致敬
    【新华社北京五日电】中苏友好协会总会成立大会通过向斯大林大元帅致敬电，电文如下：斯大林大元帅：
    拥有全中国各界和各少数民族人民为会员的中苏友好协会，今日在北京举行成立大会；我们的大会一致决定，向你——全世界劳动人民的伟大导师与领袖，到最热烈最崇高的敬礼！
    苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟和中华人民共和国的人民，向来有着深厚密切的友谊。中国人民还是牢牢地记着：当十月革命成功之后，苏联在伟大的列宁和你的领导下，首先自动地废弃帝俄与中国所订立的不平等条约；当一九二四年至一九二七年中国第一次大革命时，苏联曾给中国人民以巨大的帮助；当一九三七年日本法西斯进攻中国的时候，苏联在你的领导之下，首先给中国以物资的和精神的巨大援助；并于一九四五年出兵东北消灭了日本关东军，解放我东北。总之，三十年来每逢中国遭遇外来的侵略，苏联没有不表示诚挚的同情和热烈的关切！
    可是，过去中国国民党的反动统治，掩蔽了苏联对中国人民的伟大友谊，也压制了中国人民对苏联的友谊，在外国帝国主义操纵下的中国国民党反动派，直接成为中苏两国人民友好合作的障碍。
    现在，我们在中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席领导之下，扫除了中苏两国友好合作的一切障碍，苏联政府首先承认我们的中央人民政府，更进一步铺平了中苏两国亲密合作的大道，从此中苏两国间热诚的友谊和亲密的合作，将不会有任何的障碍了；中苏两国人民将永远如兄弟一般携起手来，共同地为促进两国人民的幸福、和世界人民民主与持久和平而奋斗到底。

    【新华社北京五日电】中苏友好协会总会成立大会通过向毛泽东主席致敬电，电文如下：敬爱的毛主席：
    中苏友好协会今日在北京举行盛大的成立大会。我们到会的代表们鉴于过去苏联对中国的伟大友谊与帮助，一直被国民党反动派所掩蔽和歪曲，中国人民对苏联的诚挚友谊，也被国民党反动派所压制和摧残，正是由于你——我们的伟大领袖与革命导师，领导着我们扫除了中苏两国友好合作的一切障碍，使我们能够坦率地表现出对苏联的诚挚友谊来。我们的大会一致决定向你致最崇高的敬礼！
    我们誓愿紧紧地追随着你，为增进中苏两国的友好合作而努力，为促进中苏两国人民的文明幸福而努力，为争取世界人民民主与持久和平而努力！
    毛泽东的旗帜，是保证我们永远胜利的旗帜！
