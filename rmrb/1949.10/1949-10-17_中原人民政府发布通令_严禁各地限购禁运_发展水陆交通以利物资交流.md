Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 16th. The Central Plains People's Government issued a circular strictly prohibiting local governments in the Central China region from arbitrarily restricting the sale and transportation of goods and levying additional taxes and levies, in order to guarantee and promote the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. The circular pointed out: The old methods of market management implemented by various regions under the enemy's division are no longer applicable. However, governments at all levels in various provinces and regions are still following the old methods, arbitrarily restricting transportation and sales and arbitrarily levying additional taxes and levies under the pretext of price fluctuations. This phenomenon has obstructed and undermined the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas in Central China, and the restoration and development of industry, agriculture, and commerce, and should be quickly corrected. The circular stipulates: (1) The exchange of materials between urban and rural areas within the Central China region and between the Central China region and neighboring liberated areas should be unblocked. Without the approval of this government, no harmful measures such as restricting transportation and prohibiting purchases shall be implemented. (2) Regarding local taxation, in addition to the regulations and laws promulgated by the Central Plains People's Government and the approved tax collection methods of various provinces, no arbitrary additions or additions of taxes and levies shall be allowed. (3) The circulation of Renminbi shall not be restricted. Various localities should have appropriate management of the market, eliminate silver dollars, and cooperate with trade agencies to regulate market supply and demand, prevent speculation and price gouging, and prevent drastic price increases and decreases. (4) Make every effort to support the restoration and development of all public and private water and land transportation undertakings. Military transport and cargo transport, public transport and commercial transport, must be considered in an all-round way. The circular also pointed out that the transportation organizations in many regions, due to the control of guildism and feudal gangsters, arbitrarily demand dock fees and loading and unloading fees, which seriously increases the cost of industry and commerce and increases the difficulties for commercial transportation. Local governments and trade unions must take care of the workers' lives and their due remuneration, and at the same time resolutely correct bad habits and excessive demands to facilitate commercial transportation.

　　中原人民政府发布通令
  　严禁各地限购禁运
    发展水陆交通以利物资交流
    【新华社汉口十六日电】中原人民政府发布通令，严禁华中区各地政府任意限制货物运销和征收附加捐税，以保障和促进城乡内外的物资交流。通令指出：过去各地区在敌人分割环境下所实施的市场管理的旧办法已不适用。而现在各省区各级政府仍有沿用旧办法，借口物价波动，任意限制运销及任意征收附加捐税等现象。这种现象对华中区的城乡内外物资交流，和恢复与发展工农商业，已起了阻挠和破坏的作用，应迅速予以纠正。该通令规定：（一）华中区内地和华中区与友邻解放区间，应畅通城乡内外物资交流，凡未经本府批准，不得实行限运禁购等有害措施。（二）各地税收，除中原人民政府公布之章则法令及经核准的各省征税办法外，不得任意附加及增列捐税。（三）不得限制人民币流通。各地对市场应有适宜的管理，肃清银元，并配合贸易机关调节市场供求，防止投机倒把和物价暴涨暴跌。（四）全力扶助一切公私营水陆交通运输事业的恢复和发展。军运与货运，公运与商运，必须兼筹并顾。通令并指出：不少地区的运输组织，由于行会主义和封建流氓的把持，任意索取码头费和装卸费，严重地增加了工商业的成本和增加了对商运的困扰。各地政府与职工会，必须照顾工人生活与应得之酬报，同时切实纠正陋规苛索，以便利商运。
