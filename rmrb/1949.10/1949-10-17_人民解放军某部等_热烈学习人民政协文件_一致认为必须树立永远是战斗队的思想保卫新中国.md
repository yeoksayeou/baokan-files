　　People's Liberation Army Units, etc.
　　Enthusiastically Study CPPCC Documents
　　Unanimously Agreeing That We Must Establish the Idea of Always Being a Fighting Force to Defend the New China
　　[Reported by this newspaper] Certain units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are actively studying the documents of the CPPCC. The political department of a certain unit instructed its subordinate units on September 30 to focus on the opening speech of Chairman Mao, the speeches of Commander-in-Chief Zhu and Comrade Liu Shaoqi, as well as the Xinhua News Agency editorial ("Old China is Dead, New China is Born"), etc., and conduct a preliminary study for one week. On October 2, the political department held its first symposium, and everyone spoke enthusiastically. In their speeches, everyone unanimously agreed that the convening of the CPPCC and the birth of the Central People's Government were mainly due to the correct and wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the victory of the People's Liberation War, and the victory of the united front. This is indeed a major event worthy of celebration. Song Shaokang said: "For more than ten years, we have fought heroically and arduously with the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang reactionaries supported by American imperialism. Thanks to Chairman Mao's correct leadership, we finally defeated Japan and Chiang Kai-shek, and we have our own Central People's Government. Without the leadership of the Party, how could we have today?" Liu Xing and Li Junyuan said in their speeches: "The guarantee made by Commander-in-Chief Zhu at the conference represents the will of all of us. We should resolutely complete it. We must strengthen our study, strengthen regularization, and strive to become a strong national defense force." Yang Ziming, head of the propaganda section, said: "We must recognize that the Common Program is the minimum program of our Party and also the criterion for our Party's current policies. Therefore, we must resolutely support and abide by the laws and decrees of the government." Finally, Director Gong summarized everyone's speeches and specifically called on everyone to: 1. Strive to study and organize the entire army to study the CPPCC documents, implement the spirit of the documents, and transform them into our actions. 2. Seriously examine our level of regularization and overcome various guerrilla habits and phenomena of disorganization and indiscipline. 3. We must establish the idea of always being a fighting force, become revolutionary professionals, and build our troops into a strong national defense force to defend our New China.
　　On September 28, a certain unit held a meeting of cadres at the company level and above, where Deputy Political Commissar Zhang conveyed and mobilized the study of the CPPCC documents. After conveying several documents designated for study, he emphasized: It is necessary to connect with the idea of "always being a fighting team," and to understand the significance of Chairman Mao's words in his opening speech, "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never be reconciled to their defeat, and they will make a final struggle..." Only by connecting with thinking can learning achieve great results.
　　All cadres and students of the Second Brigade of a certain unit's infantry school launched a study of all the documents of the CPPCC. In order to study in depth, Group A of the brigade headquarters first asked everyone to raise some easily ambiguous questions and discuss them one by one; then they discussed the documents item by item. Zheng Fu, the propaganda and education officer, collected some terms and questions that the students were not very clear about, and the answers to these terms and questions were very helpful for in-depth study of the documents. In addition, the cadres of the Third Brigade are also focusing on the CPPCC documents, reading the newspaper collectively, as a preparation for carrying out formal study of the documents.

　　人民解放军某部等
  　热烈学习人民政协文件
    一致认为必须树立永远是战斗队的思想保卫新中国
    【本报讯】中国人民解放军某某等部积极学习人民政协文件。某部政治部于九月三十日指示所属部队，以毛主席的开幕词，朱总司令、刘少奇同志的讲话以及新华社社论（旧中国灭亡了，新中国诞生了）等文件为主，以一周时间作初步学习。十月二日，政治部召开首次座谈会，大家都热烈发言。在发言中，一致认为：人民政协的召开和中央人民政府的诞生，主要是由于中国共产党和毛主席领导的正确与英明、人民解放战争的胜利、统一战线的胜利，这实在是一件值得祝贺的大事。宋少康说：“十几年来我们和日寇、及美帝所支持的国民党反动派作了英勇艰苦的斗争，由于毛主席领导的正确，我们终于打败了日本和蒋介石，并有了咱们自己的中央人民政府，若没有党的领导，那能有今天？”流星、李俊元发言说：“朱总司令在大会上提出的保证，是代表了我们大家的意志，我们应当坚决去完成，我们要加强学习，加强正规化，锻炼成为一支坚强的国防军。”宣传科长杨子明说：“我们必须认清共同纲领是我党的最低纲领，也是我党目前各种政策的准则。因此，我们必须坚决的拥护和遵守政府的法令。”最后宫主任总结大家发言，特号召大家要：一、努力学习与组织全军学习人民政协文献，贯彻文件精神，变成我们的行动。二、认真检查我们正规化的水平，克服各种游击习气与无组织无纪律现象。三、必须树立永远是战斗队的思想，成为革命的职业家，把我们的部队建设为一支强大的国防军，保卫我们的新中国。
    某部于九月二十八日，召开连以上干部会，由张副政委传达和动员关于人民政协文献的学习。他在传达了指定要学习的几个文件后，着重指出：要联系“永远是个战斗队”的思想，要领会毛主席在开幕词中所说的“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们要做最后的挣扎……”这句话的意义。只有联系思想，学习成绩才会大。
    某部步校二大队全体干部学员，展开对人民政协一切文件的学习。大队部的甲组为了学习深入，先由大家提出一些容易模糊的问题，逐一讨论；之后再按照文件逐条讨论。宣教干事郑夫，搜集了一些学员们不太明确的名词和问题，这些名词与问题的解答，很有助于文件的深入学习。此外，三大队的干部，也在以人民政协文件为中心，集体读报，作为开展正式学习文件的准备。
