Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 24th. How to carry out winter work in the rural areas of Northeast China has become an urgent issue that needs to be resolved, with the conclusion of the autumn harvest work in the entire Northeast region. The "Instructions on Rural Work for This Winter" issued by the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the 18th of this month stipulates a solution to this problem. The instructions pointed out: The main tasks of rural work in the old areas of Northeast China this winter are to organize sideline production for the broad masses, consolidate and plan the development of supply and marketing cooperatives, complete the task of grain requisition and purchase, rotate training for district and village cadres, promote democracy inside and outside the Party, strengthen ties with the masses, and focus on consolidating Party branches and developing Party work. Among these tasks, organizing sideline production is the central focus. The instructions listed the following important tasks that must be carried out this winter and the points that should be noted: (A) Organize sideline production for the masses. When organizing sideline production, it is necessary to proceed from market and national needs and local specific conditions, and it must be well integrated with local state-owned stores and cooperatives. Oppose blind pursuit and generalization. In disaster areas and semi-disaster areas, emphasis should be placed on production to overcome famine and should be closely linked with preparations for next year's great production. (B) Make full use of the organization of the People's Representative Conference. Genuinely convene provincial and county People's Representative Conferences to solve one or two major issues related to the lives of the vast majority of people in the respective provinces and counties (such as this year's burden and next year's agricultural production, etc.); at the same time, universally hold village People's Representative Assemblies, re-elect village people's governments, and establish a People's Representative Conference system to strengthen the ties between the people and the government, strengthen the people's supervision of the government, oppose bureaucracy, and improve leadership and work. (C) Convene provincial and county Party representative conferences and district and village Party member congresses, promote inner-Party democracy, promote criticism and self-criticism, and discuss one or two major issues urgently demanding solutions by the masses within the respective regions and the main ideological problems within the Party, so as to strengthen the ties between the Party and the people, improve work style, and improve the Party committee system. At the same time, it is necessary to focus on consolidating rural branches and plan to develop those conscious elements who play an active leading role in production mutual aid organizations into Party members, so as to strengthen the Party's role as a fortress in rural areas. (D) Run Party and non-Party cadre training classes in districts and villages. In the five or six months of autumn and winter, systematically rotate and train all district and village cadres once, so as to improve their ideological awareness and work ability. The training content mainly focuses on explaining the Party's important policies and work methods (such as autumn and winter work tasks, cooperatives, mutual aid, People's Representative Conferences, etc.) and basic Party knowledge, based on the current central tasks, and avoid old-fashioned and doctrinaire approaches. The methods can adopt various lively forms such as summarizing experience and seminars.
    The instructions said: The above tasks are all necessary conditions for doing a good job in next year's great production movement. In addition, convening labor model conferences, rewarding production models (should focus on rewarding model mutual aid organizations), summarizing this year's production and exchange labor mutual aid experience, holding agricultural exhibitions, launching winter literacy movements, strengthening adult literacy education (should be combined with the lives and production of the masses), raising the class consciousness of the masses, and strengthening the masses' understanding of the direction and path of rural economic development, etc., can all be combined and carried out according to the actual situation and needs of each province.
    The instructions emphatically pointed out: At present, the central task of the entire Party in Northeast China is to do a good job in economic construction, especially industrial construction. We should pay more attention to urban work than ever before. This is very necessary. But this does not mean that rural work is not important or that we can relax rural work. It would be wrong to think so. Agricultural production still accounts for a large proportion of the total production value of Northeast China. Our industrial raw materials and our investment in industry still mainly rely on agriculture. And there are still some serious problems in our rural work. Therefore, we must not relax rural work and ignore its importance. All provincial Party committees should devote most of their energy to paying attention to rural work, while Party committees below the county level should devote all their efforts to carrying out rural work. We must study how to organize all the people in rural areas who can engage in production to the agricultural and sideline production front, how to improve agricultural productivity, how to run cooperatives well, how to realize the integration of urban and rural areas, and how to further improve the consciousness of farmers, so that they gradually understand the path and direction of rural economic development. At the same time, we should also study the new changes in the rural economy in the two years after land reform, discover new problems, and carry out work with a new perspective and new methods of urban-rural integration, and push rural work forward.

　　准备明年大生产条件
  　东北局发布对今冬农村工作指示 
    组织群众副业生产
  　认真开好省县人民代表会议
    【新华社沈阳二十四日电】东北农村如何进行冬季工作问题，随着东北全境秋收工作的结束，已经成了当前迫切需要解决的问题。中共中央东北局本月十八日发布的“对今冬农村工作的指示”，对这个问题作出了规定。指示指出：今冬东北老区农村工作的主要任务是组织广大群众的副业生产，整理与有计划地发展供销合作社，完成征粮购粮任务，轮训区村干部，发扬党内外民主，加强与群众联系，有重点的进行整理支部与发展党的工作，这些工作中，以组织副业生产为中心。指示列举今冬必须进行的各项重要工作及其应注意之点如下：（甲）组织群众的副业生产。组织副业生产时，要从市场与国家需要及当地具体情况出发，要同当地国家商店与合作社很好地结合，反对盲目的搞，反对一般化。在灾区与半灾区，应强调生产渡荒，并与准备明年的大生产密切结合起来。（乙）充分使用人民代表会议的组织。真正开好省、县人民代表会议，解决关系各该省县绝大多数人民生活的一两个重大问题（如今年的负担与明年的农业生产等）；同时普遍举行村人民代表大会，改选村人民政府，建立人民代表会议制度，以密切人民与政府的联系，加强人民对政府的监督，反对官僚主义，改善领导与工作。（丙）召开省、县党的代表会议及区村党员大会，发扬党内民主，发扬批评与自我批评，讨论各该区域内群众迫切要求解决的一两个重大问题与党内思想的主要问题，以密切党与人民群众的联系，改进工作作风，并健全党委制。与此同时，要有重点地整顿农村支部，有计划地发展那些有觉悟的在生产互助组织中起积极领导作用的分子为党员，以加强党在农村中的堡垒作用。（丁）办好区村党的与非党的干部训练班。在秋冬五六个月中有计划地将全部区村干部轮训一次，使其在思想意识与工作能力上提高一步。训练内容主要是根据当前中心任务，说明有关的党的各项重要政策和工作方法（如秋冬工作任务、合作社、变工互助、人民代表会等）及党的基本知识，切忌老一套与教条主义。方式可采用总结经验座谈等各种活泼形式。
    指示说：以上各项工作都是作好明年大生产运动的必要条件。此外，召开劳模大会，奖励生产模范（应以对模范互助组织的奖励为重点），总结今年生产和换工互助经验，举办农业展览会，开展冬学识字运动，加强成人补习教育（应与群众的生活、生产相结合），提高群众的阶级觉悟，加强群众对农村经济发展方向与道路的认识等，都可根据各省实际情况及需要结合进行。
    指示强调地指出：目前东北全党的中心任务是搞好经济建设，特别是工业建设。我们应该比以往任何时期更加注意城市工作。这是十分必要的。但这并不是说农村工作就不重要了，可以放松农村工作了，如果这样想，那是错误的。东北全部的生产总值中，农业生产仍占很大比重。我们工业的原料，我们对工业的投资，目前主要地还是依靠农业。而我们的农村工作还存在若干严重问题。因之，我们决不能放松农村工作，忽视它的重要性。所有省委都应以大部的精力注意做农村工作，而县以下的党委则应以全部力量进行农村工作。必须研究如何将农村所有能够进行生产的人都组织到农业与副业生产战线上来，如何提高农业生产力，如何办好合作社，如何实现城乡结合，如何进一步提高农民的觉悟，使其逐渐懂得农村经济发展的道路与方向。同时还应研究土改后两年来农村经济新的变化，发现新的问题，并应以城乡结合的新的观点和新的方法进行工作，把农村工作向前推进一步。
