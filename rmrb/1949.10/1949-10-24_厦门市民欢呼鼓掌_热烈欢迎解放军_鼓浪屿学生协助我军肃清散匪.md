Xinhua News Agency, Xiamen, 23rd. Xiamen citizens warmly welcome the People's Liberation Army. On the morning of the 17th, before the battle had even ended, Xiamen citizens crowded both sides of the streets, cheering and applauding to welcome the advance units of the People's Liberation Army entering the city. Auto workers pasted red and green slogans welcoming the People's Liberation Army on both sides of the cars and slowly drove through the crowds on the road. The dockworkers at the Zhengzhong Wharf in Xiamen Port quickly gathered the ships that had been hidden before liberation to avoid destruction by the bandit troops, and braving the bombing and strafing by the bandit planes, rowed them to the opposite shore to welcome the People's Liberation Army of Gulangyu crossing the sea to enter the city. On the evening of the 16th, when the People's Liberation Army raised the five-star red flag of New China high above Gulangyu amidst the sound of gunfire, the students of Xiamen University erupted in enthusiastic cheers. On the 17th, more than 200 students remaining at the school, together with the students of Yinghua Middle School, the primary school affiliated with Xiamen University, and other schools, conducted fervent propaganda activities in groups, posting slogans and cartoons throughout the city, singing the national anthem of New China, explaining the Eight Articles of Agreement, the Three Main Rules of Discipline, and the Eight Points for Attention of the People's Liberation Army to the citizens, and assisted the People's Liberation Army in cleaning up the battlefield, clearing out the remaining bandits on Gulangyu, collecting hundreds of scattered enemy soldiers and a large number of weapons and military supplies, and escorting them to the People's Liberation Army. In addition, the students organized temporary pickets to assist the People's Liberation Army in maintaining social order and protecting public places and materials.

    【新华社厦门二十三日电】厦门市民热烈欢迎人民解放军。十七日晨战斗尚未结束，厦门市民就拥挤在马路两旁，欢呼鼓掌，迎接解放军先头部队进入市区。汽车工人们把欢迎解放军的红绿标语贴在汽车两旁，在马路人丛中缓缓驶过。厦门港中正码头的船工，把解放前为避免匪军破坏而隐藏起来的船只，迅速集中一起，冒着匪机轰炸扫射，划到对岸，迎接鼓浪屿解放军渡海进入市区。十六日晚，当解放军在炮火声中将新中国的五星红旗高悬鼓浪屿上空时，厦门大学的学生们激起了狂热的欢呼。十七日该校留校的二百余学生，联合英华中学、厦大附小，和其他学校学生，分组进行热烈的宣传活动，遍市张贴标语、漫画，高唱新中国国歌，向市民讲解人民解放军的约法八章、三大纪律和八项注意，并协助解放军打扫战场，肃清鼓浪屿残匪，搜集了数百个匪军散兵游勇和大批武器，军用物资，押送给解放军。此外，学生们又组织了临时纠察队，协助解放军维持社会秩序，保护公共场所和物资。
