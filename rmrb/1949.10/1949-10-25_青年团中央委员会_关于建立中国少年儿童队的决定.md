　　Central Committee of the Communist Youth League
  　Decision on Establishing the Chinese Young Pioneers
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 24th] The Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, at its enlarged Standing Committee meeting on October 13th, passed the resolution on establishing the Chinese Young Pioneers. The full text is as follows:

    Resolution of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League on Establishing the Chinese Young Pioneers
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　October 13, 1949
    1. In order to organize and educate the nation's children, the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, based on the resolution of the League's First National Congress, believes that it is currently necessary to establish the Young Pioneers throughout the country and hereby publishes the draft charter of the Chinese Young Pioneers.
    2. The Chinese Young Pioneers is a youth organization under the leadership of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, absorbing children aged nine to fifteen. This organization unites and educates children through learning and various collective activities, cultivating them to become outstanding sons and daughters of the new China who love the motherland, love the people, love labor, love science, and cherish public property.
    3. Youth League committees at all levels should strengthen their leadership over the work of children, widely publicize the nature and role of the Young Pioneers to children and elementary school teachers, and must, with the support and assistance of the teachers, begin first in schools with better working conditions and in villages and towns with more concentrated populations and a better foundation for League work. The Central Committee of the Youth League also instructs the League organizations in these areas to assign some outstanding League members to undertake the work of establishing the Young Pioneers. The Young Pioneers above the district level will not have a headquarters. The children's work departments of the League committees above the district level will serve as the leading organs of the Young Pioneers. Schools, organizations, streets, villages (or townships) with Young Pioneers organizations should establish headquarters, and the captain should be elected by the members.

    In places where Young Pioneers, Children's Corps, elementary school student unions and other children's organizations have already been established, the local Youth League committee shall be responsible for convening cadres leading children's work, the Young Pioneers captain, or other persons in charge of children's organizations to discuss the draft charter of the Chinese Young Pioneers. After obtaining everyone's agreement to the draft charter, the organization shall be adjusted in accordance with its provisions.
    4. After receiving this resolution, the League's regional committees, provincial committees (district League committees), municipal committees, prefectural committees, and county committees should immediately convene children's work conferences, summarize past experiences in children's work, discuss the draft charter of the Chinese Young Pioneers, formulate children's work plans, and earnestly implement them.
    5. The Central Committee of the Youth League plans to convene a national conference of children's cadres next spring to further study children's work. (Detailed arrangements will be notified separately.)

  　关于建立中国少年儿童队的决定
    【新华社北京二十四日电】中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会，于十月十三日扩大常委会上，通过了关于建立中国少年儿童队的决议，全文如下：
    中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会关于建立中国少年儿童队的决议
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　一九四九年十月十三日
    一、为了组织和教育全国少年儿童，中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会根据团的第一次全国代表大会决议，认为目前在全国各地有建立少年儿童队的必要，并将中国少年儿童队章程草案公布。
    二、中国少年儿童队是在中国新民主主义青年团领导下的少年儿童组织，吸收九岁到十五岁的少年儿童参加。这个组织是在学习和各种集体活动中，团结和教育少年儿童，培养他们成为爱祖国、爱人民、爱劳动、爱科学和爱护公共财物的新中国的优秀儿女。
    三、各级团委要加强领导少年儿童工作，要广泛地向少年儿童、向小学教师宣传少年儿童队的性质及作用，并须在取得教师们的支持和协助下，首先从工作条件较好的学校与人口较集中、团的工作基础较好的村镇开始。青年团中央并责成这些地方团的组织，划出一部分优秀团员担任建立少年儿童队的工作。区级以上的少年儿童队不设队部，团的区委以上的少年儿童部，即作为少年儿童队的领导机关。学校、机关、街道、村庄（或乡）各单位有少年儿童队组织的地方，应设队部，队长由队员选举产生之。
    在已经建立少年先锋队、儿童团、小学学生会等少年儿童组织的地方，由该地团委负责召集领导少年儿童工作的干部，少年先锋队队长或其他少年儿童组织负责人开会，讨论中国少年儿童队章程草案，获得大家同意该章程草案后，即按其规定调整组织。
    四、团的各区域委员会、省委（区团委）、市委、地委和县委接到此决议后，应即召开少年儿童工作会议，总结过去少年儿童工作经验，讨论中国少年儿童队章程草案，定出少年儿童工作计划，并切实执行。
    五、青年团中央拟于明春召集全国少年儿童干部大会，以便进一步研究少年儿童工作。（详细办法另行通知）
