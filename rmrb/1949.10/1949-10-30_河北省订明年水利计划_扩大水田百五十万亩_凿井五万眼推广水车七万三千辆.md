　　Hebei Province Formulates Next Year's Water Conservancy Plan
　　Expanding Paddy Fields by 1.5 Million Mu
　　Digging 50,000 Wells and Promoting 73,000 Waterwheels
　　[Report from this newspaper] From September 21st to September 26th, the Agriculture Department of the Hebei Provincial Government convened a water conservancy conference of agricultural section chiefs from various special districts, determining the province's water conservancy construction plan for next year. It was resolved that in 1950, 1.5 million mu of dry land would be converted into paddy fields, 51,315 wells would be dug, and 73,079 waterwheels would be promoted, so as to enable the province to complete the task of expanding paddy fields by 5 million mu within two to three years. In the conference summary, the Agriculture Department called on cadres to overcome difficulties and complete the task. The work must first dispel the ideological concerns of farmers, fully mobilize farmers, and explain that the original burden will not be changed for three years after drilling new wells. Secondly, there must be meticulous organizational work, support for the start of waterwheel factories, organization of well-drilling teams and auger-drilling teams, assistance to old brick kilns and the establishment of new kilns, and assistance to farmers in making all preparations. Within October, each special district should extract a certain number of cadres to be specifically responsible for promoting this work. In the summary, specific regulations were made for various concrete issues. The task of promoting waterwheels requires all localities to complete 60% to 70% by May of next year, striving for 80%. The completion of canal excavation and well digging is required by May.
　　[Further dispatch] The Baoding Special Commissioner's Office convened a joint meeting of industry section chiefs and supply and marketing cooperative cadres from various counties, as well as directors of state-owned factories, on October 10th to study water conservancy work. The Special Commissioner's Office had previously held a meeting in mid-September, planning to dig 8,275 large and small brick wells, equip 14,475 waterwheels in seventeen counties, and construct ten canals, increasing paddy fields by a total of 25 mu. At that time, due to unclear specific measures, cadres lacked confidence. This meeting overcame everyone's passive phenomenon of simply waiting for material support, and confidence was increased, recognizing that the key to completing the task lies in concrete organization and in-depth leadership. The participating cadres immediately telephoned county leaders to suggest dispatching cadres to organize brick kilns in the countryside. Counties such as Xincheng have planned to dig more wells and repair waterwheels. Furthermore, An Guo District of Dingxian Special District has now organized eighteen brick kilns, and the Qingyuan County Supply and Marketing Cooperative of Baoding Special District has also organized fourteen kilns, laying a favorable foundation for digging wells next year.

　　河北省订明年水利计划　
    扩大水田百五十万亩            
    凿井五万眼推广水车七万三千辆
    【本报讯】九月二十一日至九月二十六日，河北省政府农业厅召集各专区农业科长举行水利会议，确定明年全省水利建设计划，决议于一九五○年，变旱田为水田一百五十万亩，凿井五万一千三百一十五眼，推广水车七万三千零七十九辆，以使全省在二三年内，完成扩大水田五百万亩的任务。在大会总结中，农业厅号召干部克服困难完成任务。在工作中首先须解除农民的思想顾虑，充分发动农民，说明打新井后三年不改变原来负担。其次必须有细致的组织工作，扶植水车工厂开工，组织凿井班、锥井班，扶助旧的砖窑并建立新窑，帮助农民作好一切准备工作。十月份内，各专区要抽出一定数量干部，专责推动这一工作。在总结中对各具体问题，均做出规定，推广水车任务，要求各地在明年五月完成百分之六、七十，争取到八十。开渠打井要求在五月份全部完成。
    【又讯】保定专署于十月十日召开各县实业科长、供销社干部、公营工厂厂长联席会议，研究水利工作。按该专署九月中旬即曾召开会议，计划打大小砖井八二七五眼，十七个县装水车一四四七五辆，兴修渠十道，共增加水田二十五亩。当时因具体办法不明确，干部信心不足。这次会议中克服了大家单等物资支持的被动现象，信心提高，认清完成任务的关键在于具体组织深入领导。与会干部并立即打电话向县领导建议，抽派干部，下乡组织砖窑。新城等县已计划更多打井修水车。又定县专区安国一区现已组织砖窑十八座，保定专区清苑县供销社也已组织起十四个窑，为明年打井打下有利基础。
