　　Visiting Li Rengen
  　The People of Guangxi Yearn for Liberation

    This reporter interviewed Li Rengen, who came from afar in Guangxi to participate in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. He is one of the representatives of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and also a veteran member of the Tongmenghui from 1911. During the Great Revolution, Li Rengen once came to Beijing, but soon returned to Guangxi, and it has been twenty-one years since then. He said, "This revisit to the old place evokes endless excitement. The most profound impression is that an ancient imperial capital has now become the people's own capital, where labor is respected and filled with new vitality everywhere."

    "At the CPPCC, I saw the light of the new China." Li Rengen spoke with excitement, telling of his admiration for Chairman Mao. He said, "Chairman Mao's attitude is calm, gentle, sincere, and wise. The people have truly found their leader. Chairman Mao's thought is a great synthesis of Chinese and foreign revolutionary thought, not only leading the Chinese people to victory but also having a great impact on Asia and the world."

    "The people of Guangxi before dawn are fighting heroically, yearning for liberation!" Li Rengen's conversation naturally turned to this topic of great concern to the broad masses of the people.

    Guangxi is located on the southwestern border of China, with a population of 15 million and an area of 650,000 square li. Due to the long-term rule and plunder by the Chiang Kai-shek and Li Zongren bandit gangs, this resource-rich province has suffered from years of drought and flood disasters. In the past eleven years, the conscription of soldiers and grain has reduced the labor force in rural areas and lowered production. The people of Guangxi, who could have made a living, have become destitute. Li Rengen said, "The Li Bai warlords defied the people, and the people abandoned them." Since then, the people of Guangxi have understood that to be liberated, they must rise up and fight. Therefore, as soon as the People's Liberation War began, the people of Guangxi revolted one after another and directly joined the armed struggle. The reactionary rulers, in their extreme ferocity, began a brutal suppression of the people of Guangxi, successively disbanding the Liangjiang Normal School, the Guangxi Art School, and the Longcheng Middle School. Teachers and students were arrested and killed, implementing a policy of strangling culture and education. The provincial puppet security team attacked the people's armed forces, burning, killing, and looting in the countryside, implementing a policy of destruction. He recalled that once, the puppet security team attacked the people's armed forces in Wuxuan, Guiping, and other areas, robbing and eating all the farmers' rice, grain, chickens, ducks, pigs, and cattle, and finally burning down the houses. Prisons were built throughout the province, and farmers and students were arrested in batches, subjected to either torture or huge fines, causing people to lose their fortunes and become displaced. Speaking of this, Li Rengen said indignantly, "All this brutal suppression cannot subdue the people of Guangxi. On the contrary, large numbers of farmers and students poured into the people's armed forces, and the flames of guerrilla warfare spread throughout the mountains and fields of Guangxi. The people's armed forces have grown from fighting and grown stronger from fighting over the past three years. They have established flesh-and-blood ties with the masses, protecting the interests of the masses at all times. The masses love them as they love their own sons, helping the guerrillas to deliver messages, lead the way, scout, and strike at the enemy. In this way, they have survived the most difficult years. In areas still ruled by the enemy, workers, students, and citizens have always persisted in underground struggles. News from the liberated areas, Xinhua News Agency editorials, and various revolutionary books and periodicals are transmitted everywhere. There have also been many tragic stories here. Xu Zhi, a primary school teacher in Guilin, distributed the Eight Articles of the People's Liberation Army door-to-door along the streets of Guilin until he had delivered them all, but he was then arrested. When he was tried in court, he was tortured but never revealed a single person, showing steadfastness. As a result, he died a martyr."

    Before dawn in Guangxi, the successive victories of "Liberating Shanghai" and "Liberating Changsha" encouraged the people of all walks of life in Guangxi. At present, they are still persisting in open, secret, armed, and various struggles everywhere in factories, mines, schools, rural areas, and mountains. Although the environment is still so difficult and the enemy is still so ferocious, they have seen the dawn of dawn, are full of confidence, and persist in the struggle. Millions of fiery hearts are yearning for liberation. When Mr. Li set off northward this time, many people enthusiastically asked him to tell the People's Liberation Army: "We eagerly hope that the People's Liberation Army will come quickly. We have long been prepared to welcome them."

### 访问李任仁  广西人民渴待解放

　　访问李任仁
  　广西人民渴待解放
    记者访问了远从广西赶来参加人民政治协商会议的李任仁。他是中国国民党革命委员会代表之一，也是一九一一年的老同盟会员。大革命时代，李任仁曾一度来京，不久即返回广西，至今已是二十一个年头了。他说：“这次旧地重游，引起无限的兴奋。印象最深的是：一个古老的帝王都城，如今变成了人民自己的首都，在这里劳动受着尊重，到处充沛着新生气象。”
    “在政协会上，我看到了新中国的光明。”李任仁以充满兴奋的心情，讲述他对毛主席的敬仰。他说：“毛主席的态度，沉着、温雅、诚恳、英明，人民真正找到了自己的领袖：毛主席思想，是集中外革命思想之大成，不但领导中国人民走向胜利，对亚洲对世界，也有着极大的影响。”
    “黎明前的广西人民，在英勇斗争，在渴待解放！”李任仁的谈锋，很自然的转到这个目前为广大人民所关怀的话题。
    广西地处中国西南边陲，人口一千五百万，面积六十五万平方里，全境山脉纵横，群川奔注。这个物产繁茂的省份由于蒋李匪帮长期统治搜刮的结果，造成连年水旱灾害，近十一年来征兵征实，以致农村劳力减少，生产降低，原可以过活得下的广西人民已变得民不聊生。李任仁说：“李白军阀违背人民，人民就抛弃了他们。”从此广西人民懂得了：要解放，只有起来斗争。于是在人民解放战争一开始，广西人民纷纷起义，直接投入了武装斗争。反动统治者，穷凶极恶，也就开始了对广西人民的残暴镇压：先后解散两江师范、广西艺专、龙城中学，教员学生被捕被杀，实行对文化教育的绞杀政策。省伪保安队，进攻人民武装，在农村烧杀抢掠，实行毁灭政策。他记得有一次，伪保安队进攻武宣、桂平一带的人民武装，将农民的米粮、鸡鸭、猪牛全部抢光吃光，最后将房子烧光。全省大兴牢狱，农民、学生成批的被捕，不是酷刑拷打，即是巨额罚款，使人民倾家败产流离失所。谈到这里，李任仁愤慨的说：“这一切残暴的镇压，都屈服不了广西人民。相反的，大批的农民、学生涌入了人民武装，游击战火燃遍了广西的山野。人民武装三年来，从战斗中生长，从战斗中发展壮大。他们和群众建立了血肉的联系，时刻保卫着群众利益；群众爱护他们象是爱护自己的儿子，帮助游击队送信带路侦察，打击敌人。就这样渡过了最艰苦的岁月。在敌人还在统治着的地区，工人学生市民始终坚持了地下斗争，解放区的新闻，新华社的社论，各种革命书刊，在到处传送，在这里也曾发生过不少悲壮的故事；桂林的一个小学教员徐智，他在桂林市沿街遂户去散发人民解放军约法八章，一直到送完了，但他也接着被捕了。他在法庭上被审时，受尽拷打，始终未说出一个人，表现了坚贞不屈。结果慷慨就义。
    在广西黎明以前“解放上海”，“解放长沙”，这一连串的胜利捷报，鼓舞了广西各阶层的人民。目前他们仍在工厂里、矿山里、学校里、农村里、山野里，到处在坚持着公开的、秘密的、武装的、各式各样的斗争。虽然环境还是那么艰苦，敌人还是那么凶暴，但他们已看到破晓的曙光，信心百倍，坚持着斗争。千百万颗火热的心，正渴待解放。当这次李老先生启程北上时，不少的人民热情的要他转告解放军说：“我们迫切的企望解放军快快到来，我们早已准备欢迎了。”
