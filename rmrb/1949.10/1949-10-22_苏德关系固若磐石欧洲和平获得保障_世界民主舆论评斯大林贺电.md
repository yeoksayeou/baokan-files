Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 21st -- World democratic public opinion has published articles commenting on Stalin's historically significant congratulatory telegram to President Pieck and Premier Grotewohl of the German Democratic Republic, and all emphasize the significance of Stalin's statement that "the parallel existence of a peace-loving democratic Germany and a peace-loving Soviet Union makes a new war in Europe impossible."

	The Polish People's Tribune published an editorial entitled "Guarantee of European Peace," stating: For the first time in history, the German people have their own democratic representative body. The German people can victoriously defend Germany's potential, preventing it from falling into the hands of imperialists and warmongers. All peace-loving people fully understand the importance of this event. For Poland, this is a particularly significant event because Poland has long been threatened by Prussia's "drive to the East." We welcome with great joy the congratulatory telegram from the great leader of the Soviet people and the people of the entire world peace camp to the President and Prime Minister of the new German Democratic Republic, regarding it as an indication of the victory of the force guaranteeing the consolidation of peace and the security of Poland.

	The Bulgarian Labor Daily published an editorial stating: "In Europe, the Soviet and German peoples, with the greatest potential, have shattered the schemes of the American imperialists to launch a new war in Europe through a joint and resolute struggle to accomplish a great action of world importance. This is why the establishment of the German Democratic Republic is hailed in Stalin's telegram as a 'turning point in European history.'"

	The Romanian Spark newspaper emphasized in its editorial that Stalin's congratulatory telegram is a political document of world historical importance. Stalin has placed the issue of Soviet-German relations on a rock-solid foundation. Stalin's congratulatory telegram, a truly Marxist-Leninist document, not only shows the key to the actual achievements of peace but also points the way.

	The Hungarian "Free People" newspaper commented: The establishment of the German Democratic Republic marks the beginning of the struggle to achieve German unity and enable all German people to participate in the peace camp. Stalin's congratulatory telegram is a tremendous aid to the German people in struggle. After Comrade Stalin issued the congratulatory telegram, as Pieck and Grotewohl declared, the democratic forces of Germany will defend and promote peace with greater determination.

	The editorial of the Italian Unity Daily pointed out: The initial comments from various places on Stalin's congratulatory telegram unanimously emphasize its historical significance, not only from the perspective of Soviet-German relations, but also from the perspective of the future and peace of all European countries. The turning point Stalin mentioned lies in the fact that the German Republic has an institution and leadership that guarantees the security of the entire Europe, which is the first time in history. The establishment of the German Democratic Republic not only represents the end of the infamous "drive to the East" attempt, but also represents the joining of European peace and Germany's enormous historical and economic potential to the cause of peace.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 21st -- TASS News Agency, New York, 16th: Although the New York Times has not yet commented on Stalin's congratulatory telegram to the German people celebrating the birth of the German Democratic Republic in an editorial, it has published a commentary by the newspaper's Berlin correspondent Middleton and a report by the newspaper's Moscow correspondent Salis. The latter said in the report that Moscow has no doubt that Stalin's letter has opened a new era. Middleton said that American and British political observers in Berlin were shocked by the depth of the alliance between the new German government and the Soviet Union contained in the telegrams exchanged between Stalin and the leaders of the new German government. According to Middleton, observers specifically pointed out the enthusiasm on the Soviet side. Westerners said that Stalin's telegram was sent to a much broader mass than Pieck and Grotewohl, and in the final analysis, it was sent to the people of West Germany.

　　苏德关系固若磐石欧洲和平获得保障
  　世界民主舆论评斯大林贺电
    【新华社北京二十一日电】世界民主舆论纷纷著文评论斯大林致德意志民主共和国皮克总统与格罗提渥总理的有历史意义的贺电，并都着重指出斯大林所说“爱好和平的民主的德国与爱好和平的苏联之并肩存在，使得欧洲不再有新战争的可能”的意义。
    波兰人民论坛报以“欧洲和平的保证”为题发表社论称：德国人民在历史上第一次有了它自己的民主的代表机构，德国人民可以胜利地保卫德国的潜力，使之不致落到帝国主义与战争贩子的掌握中。一切爱好和平的人民，都充分了解这个事件的重要性，对波兰来说，这是特别重大的事件，因为波兰长时期以来即受到普鲁士“向东方推进”的威胁。我们以非常愉快的心情来欢迎苏联人民和整个世界和平阵营人民的伟大领袖致新的德意志民主共和国总统与总理的贺电，把他当作保证和平之巩固与波兰的安全的这种力量的胜利的表示。
    保加利亚劳动报发表社论称：“在欧洲，有着最大潜力的苏联及德国人民，为完成有世界重要性的伟大行动而进行的共同的坚决的斗争，粉碎了美帝国主义者意欲在欧洲发动新战争的图谋。这就是为什么德意志民主共和国之建立在斯大林的贺电中被称誉为‘欧洲历史的转折点’的原因。”
    罗马尼亚火花报在社论中着重指出，斯大林的贺电，是具有世界历史重要性的政治文件。斯大林已把苏德关系问题放在磐石般坚固的基础上。成为真正马列主义文件的斯大林的贺电，不仅显示了和平的实际成就的钥匙，而且还指出了道路。
    匈牙利“自由人民”报评称：德意志民主共和国的建立，标帜着争取德国统一和使全体德国人民参加和平阵营的斗争的开始。斯大林的贺电，是对斗争中的德国人民的一种巨大的援助。斯大林同志发表贺电之后，正如皮克和格罗提渥所声称的，德国的民主力量将以更大的决心来保卫与促进和平。
    意大利团结报的社论指出：各地对斯大林贺电的第一批评论，都一致着重指出它的历史意义，不仅对苏德关系，而且对一切欧洲国家的前途与和平这个角度来看，它都有极大的历史意义。斯大林所说的转折点，在于德意志共和国有了保证整个欧洲安全的机构和领导，这在历史上是第一次。德意志民主共和国的成立，不仅表示出劣迹昭彰的“向东方推进”的企图的终结，也表示欧洲的和平以及德国巨大的历史的与经济的潜力之加入和平事业。
    【新华社北京二十一日电】塔斯社纽约十六日讯：纽约时报迄今虽未在社论中评论斯大林向德国人民庆贺德意志民主共和国诞生的贺电，但却刊载了该报驻柏林记者米德尔敦的评论及该报驻莫斯科记者索里斯的报道。后者在报道中说，莫斯科毫不怀疑斯大林的信件揭开了新时代。米德尔敦说，柏林美英政治观察家为斯大林和新德国政府领袖互致的电文中所包含的新德国政府和苏联之间的同盟的深度所惊骇。据米德尔敦说，观察家特别指明苏联方面的热诚。西方人士说，斯大林的电文是拍给比皮克和格罗提渥广泛得多的群众，最后分析起来，是拍给西德人民的。
