　　Tito Gang Acts as Accomplice to Greek Royalist Army
　　Illegally Imprisoning Greek Guerrillas
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 15th] According to a report from the Telegraph Agency in Sofia: The "Forward" newspaper, the organ of South Communist exiles in Bulgaria, recently received a letter from a Yugoslav militia captain, describing the Tito elements' persecution of Greek democrats. The letter stated: On July 11th, a group of 200 Greek Democratic Army fighters, having been subjected to fire from the Greek Royalist fascist army and artillery fired from Yugoslav territory during the Battle of Kaimakchalan, were forced to retreat into Yugoslav territory, arriving at Konopishte. Several Tito secret police officials then came to give them speeches, denigrating the Greek Communist Party and its leader Zachariadis, and demanding that they lay down their arms. The Greek fighters refused and stated that they wanted to return to Greece immediately, whereupon they were disarmed on the spot. The Greeks said indignantly: "We have fought for six years, and now we are being shamefully betrayed by the Tito clique." The Greek fighters are being held in barracks near Skopje, where they are subjected to abuse.
    Another letter received by Forward reveals that Tito elements forbid people from listening to broadcasts from Moscow Radio, or they will be detained. The arrest of workers and students is constantly occurring.

　　铁托匪帮作希保皇军帮凶
  　非法囚禁希腊游击队
    【新华社北京十五日电】据电通社索非亚讯：保加利亚境内南共流亡者机关报“前进”报顷接获南斯拉夫民兵队长来信，述说铁托分子对希腊民主分子的迫害称：七月十一日，曾有一批为数两百名的希腊民主军战斗人员因在开马克战役中遭受到希腊保皇法西斯军和从南斯拉夫境内两面发射出来的炮火，被迫退入南斯拉夫境内，抵达科诺皮舍特。几个铁托秘密警察的官员便来对他们演说，诋毁希腊共产党及其领袖萨查利阿第斯，并要他们放下武器。希腊战斗人员加以拒绝，并表示要立刻回到希腊去，他们便被就地解除武装。希腊人愤慨地说：“我们已经斗争了六个年头，现在却被铁托集团可耻地出卖了。”希腊战斗人员被囚在斯科普里附近的营房里，受着虐待。
    前进报接获的另外的信件揭露铁托分子禁止人民收听莫斯科电台的广播，否则予以拘禁。工人学生被捕情事不断发生。
