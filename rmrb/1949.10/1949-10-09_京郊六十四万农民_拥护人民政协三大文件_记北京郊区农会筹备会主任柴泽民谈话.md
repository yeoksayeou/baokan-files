　　"The Chinese people have stood up!" Yes, this is such an exciting and proud moment for the farmers, who account for more than 80% of China's population and have suffered from feudal oppression and lived in hunger and cold for thousands of years! Our reporter recently visited Chai Zemin, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Suburban Farmers' Association, a veteran who joined the revolution in 1932.

　　Chai Zemin expressed great excitement about the establishment of the Central People's Government. He said, "Seeing our government established, I feel unspeakably happy. Not only am I happy, but the liberated farmers are even happier. This time, they held meetings with unprecedented enthusiasm and joy to celebrate this great festival. This is because they feel that they are truly the masters of the country. Take the farmers' participation in the government this time, for example. This has never happened in thousands of years. In the past, farmers were not allowed to participate in politics, let alone speak. The government in the old society was for the purpose of ruling and exploiting the working people, while the people's government truly serves the people. At the People's Representative Conference held in Beijing last time, more than 30 representatives from our suburban farmers participated. Many opinions put forward by the farmer representatives at the meeting were valued and reasonably adopted by the government, and implemented as much as possible. Now, in order to solve the problem of wheat planting this autumn, the government has lent 230,000 jin of wheat seeds, exchanged 400,000 jin of wheat seeds, and lent 100,000 jin of fertilizer to suburban farmers. Because the disaster situation in the suburbs is more serious this year, the government is now investigating the disaster situation in the suburbs in order to reduce and exempt the burden of collection as appropriate. The people's government cares about the interests of farmers in this way."

　　When talking about the three major documents formulated at the CPPCC meeting, he felt very satisfied: "This time, the Organic Law of the Central People's Government stipulates the establishment of specialized agencies such as the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Forestry and Land Reclamation, and the Ministry of Water Resources, which are all very necessary. At the same time, Article 27 of the Common Program of the CPPCC meeting mentions 'achieving land to the tiller through steps such as rent reduction and interest reduction, and land distribution.' Article 9 of the economic policy also specifically mentions the restoration and development of production, and gradually moving towards collectivization. Farmers have been thirsting for this for many years, and today they have finally waited for it. We firmly believe that under the leadership of the Central People's Government, these will definitely be realized. By striving to restore and develop agricultural production to improve the lives of the vast number of farmers, farmers will no longer be poor in the future."

　　Chai Zemin finally told reporters: We, the 640,000 farmers in the suburbs, firmly support the three major documents of the CPPCC. We will definitely ensure the resolute implementation of the policies formulated by the government in the future, and we will complete the land reform work in the suburbs before the spring plowing next year, eliminate the feudal remnants in the countryside, and organize the disaster-stricken farmers to engage in winter sideline production to build and defend the people's capital.

　　京郊六十四万农民
    拥护人民政协三大文件
    记北京郊区农会筹备会主任柴泽民谈话
    【本报专访】“中国人民从此站起来了”。是的，这对数千年来饱受封建势力压榨，过着饥寒交迫的生活，占全中国人口百分之八十以上的农民是多么欢欣鼓舞而又值得骄傲啊！本报记者日前走访北京市郊区农会筹备会主任——一九三二年即参加了革命的老战士——柴泽民。
    柴泽民对中央人民政府的成立表示了极大的兴奋，他说：“看到咱政府成立了，心里真有说不出的高兴，不仅是我自己高兴，翻了身的农民们更高兴，他们这次都以从来未有过的热情和欢喜开会庆祝这一伟大的节日。这是因为他们感到自己真正是国家的主人了。就拿这次农民参加政权来说，这是几千年来从没有过的事。过去，农民别说参政，就是连说话的地方也没有。旧社会的政权就是为着统治和压榨劳苦大众的，人民的政府是真正给人民办事的。上次在北京召开的各界人民代表会，我们郊区农民也有三十多名代表参加，农民代表在会上提出的许多意见，受到了政府的重视与合理的采纳，并尽可能的付诸实施，如今秋为了解决种麦问题，政府就贷给郊区农民麦种二十三万斤，交换麦种四十万斤，贷肥十万斤；由于今年郊区灾情较严重，现在政府正在进行调查郊区被灾情况，以便酌量减免征收负担。人民的政府就是这样关心农民利益的。”
    当谈到政协会议制定的三大文献时，他感到十二分的满意：“这次中央人民政府组织法中就规定成立农业部、林垦部、水利部等专门机关，这都是非常必要的；同时在政协会议共同纲领中第二十七条提到‘经过减租减息、和分配土地等步骤，实现耕者有其田’，经济政策中的第九条对恢复和发展生产，并逐渐走向集体化也都具体地提了出来。多少年来农民们如饥似渴的盼望今天终于盼到了，我们坚决相信在中央人民政府领导下，这些是一定能实现的。努力恢复和发展农业生产来改善广大农民的生活，农民们今后将不再会贫困了。”
    柴泽民最后对记者表示：我们郊区六十四万农民群众坚决拥护人民政协三大文献，凡今后政府制定的政策我们一定保证坚决执行，并且要在明年春耕以前完成郊区土地改革工作，肃清农村的封建残余势力，同时组织灾区农民冬季的副业生产，来建设和保卫人民的首都。
