　　Vyshinsky pointed out: The US representative verbally agreed that the death penalty must be stopped, but then tried to link this matter to the solution of the entire problem. Honest democrats and patriotic people are being hanged, shot, and drowned in the Aegean Sea simply because they once freely and bravely expressed their democratic views and dedicated themselves to this noble cause, while we are here solving the overall problem. If the US representative supports the suspension of the death penalty and the abolition of death sentences, he must support the Soviet representative's proposal. The suspension of the death penalty not only does not hinder the solution of the problem, but also helps the solution of the problem. The conscience of our committee is aroused by the crimes currently committed by the Greek government against the Greek people, so this committee cannot work quietly in an atmosphere of endless death penalties.
　　Vyshinsky said: "The Soviet delegation agrees to include the name of Kritikos, proposed by the Polish government representative, in the list of people in the draft resolution. The execution of the death penalty in Greece must be stopped. The Soviet delegation hopes that this committee will have sufficient power to prevent the sentencing of the death penalty in Greece and promote the abolition of such sentences."
　　The powerful appeal issued by the head of the Soviet delegation—the appeal to try to stop the terror of the royalist fascists in Greece—obviously made the US-UK guardians of the Greek authorities very embarrassed. Unable to weaken the strong impression made by the Soviet delegation's humanitarian appeal in the committee, the Canadian representative hastily proposed a vote on the Soviet draft resolution. The Polish representative opposed this motion, pointing out that several delegations would undoubtedly make speeches on the Soviet proposal.

　　无力抗拒苏联人道呼吁美英集团代表甚为狼狈
    维辛斯基指出：美国代表口头上曾同意必须停止死刑的执行，但却又试图把这事和整个问题的解决联系起来。心地正直的民主分子与爱国志士，只是因为他们曾经自由而勇敢地表示过他们的民主的观点和献身于这个崇高的事业，而正被吊毙，被枪杀，被淹死在爱琴海里，而我们却在这里解决全盘的问题。倘若美国代表赞成停止死刑的执行和取消死刑的判决，他就必须支持苏联代表的提议。死刑的停止执行，不仅不阻碍问题的解决，反而有助于这个问题的解决。我们这个委员会的良心被目前希腊政府对希腊人民所施的罪行激起了愤怒，所以这个委员会是不能在无休止的死刑气氛中安静工作的。
    维辛斯基说：“苏联代表团同意将波兰政府代表所提的克里齐提斯的名字，列入议案的人名单中。希腊境内的死刑必须停止执行。苏联代表团希望这个委员会将有充足的力量阻止希腊境内死刑的判决，并促使取消这种判决。”
    苏联代表团团长所发出的有力呼吁，——设法停止希腊境内保皇法西斯的恐怖的呼吁，显然使希腊当局的美英监护人甚为狼狈。由于无法减弱苏联代表团在委员会上发出人道呼吁的强烈印象，加拿大代表急忙地提议对苏联议案举行表决。波兰代表反对这个动议，指出若干代表团无疑地将就苏联提案发表演说。
