Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 28th: Paris dispatch: The new French cabinet is still in a state of difficult birth. Since the reactionary Queuille government fell on October 5th, the cabinet crisis has lasted for three weeks. During this period, the reactionary faction's attempts to form a cabinet have been declared failures twice. After the fall of the Queuille cabinet, French President Auriol appointed Mock, the leader of the Socialist Party and former Minister of the Interior, who is known for being anti-Soviet and anti-labor, to form a cabinet on the 9th. This appointment immediately aroused great indignation and strong protests from the French working people, who demanded a fundamental change in government policy and the establishment of a democratic and unified government. Under the pressure of the broad masses of the people, the contradictions and chaos within the reactionary faction became increasingly apparent. In the allocation of ministerial positions, they were unwilling to take the most difficult positions. Under these circumstances, Mock was forced to declare the failure of cabinet formation on the 17th. Afterwards, Auriol tried to persuade Schumann, Bidault, Teitgen, the leaders of the Popular Republican Movement, and former Prime Minister Queuille to form a cabinet, but they were all rejected. On the 18th, Mayer, a Radical Socialist and former Minister of Finance, accepted the task of forming a cabinet. However, this trustee official, who had implemented the devaluation of the franc and a series of "emergency financial measures" to plunder the middle class and the working people a year and a half ago, could not escape Mock's fate. He was opposed by the French working people under the leadership of the French Communist Party. French Communist Party member Duclos denounced Mayer in the National Assembly as an "international merchant." At the same time, due to disagreements with the Socialist Party on the conditions for joining the cabinet, Mayer was forced to abandon the task of forming a cabinet on the 23rd. On the evening of the same day, Auriol appointed Bidault, the leader of the Popular Republican Movement, to form a cabinet. On the 24th, Bidault began cabinet formation activities. On the evening of the 27th, the French National Assembly passed Bidault's cabinet formation with 367 votes against 183 votes. However, Bidault will obviously not fundamentally change the government policy, and therefore will certainly not gain the trust of the French people.

　　劳动人民强大压力下　
    法反动派组阁难
    【新华社北京二十八日电】巴黎讯：法国新阁仍处于难产的状态中。自反动的葛义政府于十月五日倒台之后，内阁危机至今已持续达三周，其间，反动派的组阁活动曾两度宣告失败。葛义内阁倒台后，法总统阿里奥尔曾于九日任命以反苏反劳工著名的社会党党魁、前内长莫克组阁。这一任命立即激起法国劳动人民的极大愤慨与强烈抗议，他们要求根本改变政府政策和建立民主统一政府。在广大人民的压力之下，反动派内部的矛盾与混乱亦趋显著。在部长职位的分配中，他们都不愿意担任最困难的职位。在这种情况下，莫克被迫于十七日宣告组阁失败。之后，阿里奥尔曾试图说服人民共和党党魁舒曼、皮杜尔、德东门以及前总理葛义出而组阁，但都遭到拒绝。十八日，激进社会党人、前财长迈耶始接受组阁任务。但是，这位在一年半以前曾实行法郎贬值与一系列掠夺中等阶级与劳动人民的“紧急财政措施”的托辣斯的官吏，也逃不出莫克的同样命运。他遭到在法共领导下的法国劳动人民的纷纷反对。法共议员杜克洛在国民议会中痛斥迈耶为“国际商人”。同时，又因与社会党人在入阁条件上的争持不下，结果，迈耶也不得不于二十三日被迫放弃组阁任务。同日晚，阿里奥尔又任命人民共和党党魁皮杜尔组阁。二十四日，皮杜尔开始组阁活动。二十七日晚法国民议会以三百六十七票对一百八十三票通过皮杜尔组阁。但是，皮杜尔显然绝不会根本改变政府政策，因而也断不会得到法国人民的信任。
