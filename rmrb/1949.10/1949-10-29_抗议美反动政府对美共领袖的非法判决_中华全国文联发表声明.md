　　Protesting the US Reactionary Government's Illegal Sentencing of US Communist Leaders
　　All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles Issues Statement
　　[Report from this newspaper] The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles has issued a statement regarding the US reactionary government and the New York Federal Court's sentencing of eleven leaders of the US Communist Party to imprisonment and fines, stating:
　　The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, representing all literary and art workers of the People's Republic of China, strongly protests the shameless and dark verdict of the US reactionary government and the New York Federal Court against the eleven leaders of the US Communist Party. We believe that what the US Communist leaders, such as Dennis, have done – "to defeat the fascism that is growing in the United States and to prevent the outbreak of a new world war being plotted by the Wall Street tycoons" – is precisely the duty and proper and solemn endeavor that the outstanding sons of the American people should fulfill. The Truman reactionary government's tyrannical measures against the eleven leaders of the US Communist Party not only declare its own "illegality" before the people but also thoroughly expose the outward strength and inner weakness of the fascist warmongers, who stop at nothing. It not only directly infringes upon the people's freedom and rights but is also a threat and provocation to the peace-loving and democracy-loving people of the world. The glorious America of Washington and Lincoln has been defiled by the Truman reactionary government. We firmly believe that the people of the world share our indignation and will fully support the solemn work of the eleven leaders of the US Communist Party to defend the lives and democratic freedoms of the American people, and assist them in escaping from the fascist prisons and regaining their freedom. This illegal verdict must be overturned! The injustice of the American reactionaries must be judged by the justice of the people! Long live the democratic rights of the people! Long live the outstanding warriors who fight unyieldingly for the people's justice!

　　抗议美反动政府对美共领袖的非法判决　
    中华全国文联发表声明
    【本报讯】中华全国文学艺术界联合会对美国反动政府纽约联邦法院判处美共十一位领袖以徒刑和罚金一事发表声明称：
    中华全国文学艺术界联合会代表中华人民共和国全体文学艺术工作者，严重抗议美国反动政府纽约联邦法院对美共十一位领袖的无耻而黑暗的判决。我们认为：美共领袖但尼斯等所做的：“击溃正在美国增长的法西斯主义，阻止华尔街大亨们正在策动的新的世界大战的爆发”，正是美国人民的优秀儿子所应尽的本分和正当的庄严的努力。杜鲁门反动政府加于美共十一位领袖的这种横暴的措施，不但在人民面前宣告了自己的“非法”，而且也彻底的暴露了法西斯战争贩子的外强中干，不择手段；不但直接侵犯人民的自由权力，而且是对于全世界爱好民主和平人民的威胁和挑衅。华盛顿和林肯的光荣的美国，已被杜鲁门反动政府所污辱。我们深信：全世界人民都和我们同样的愤慨，将以全力支持美共十一位领袖的保卫美国人民生活和民主自由的庄严工作，援助他们走出法西斯牢狱，重新获得自由。必须取消这一非法的判决，必须以人民的正义审判美国反动分子的不义！人民的民主权力万岁！为人民正义而作不屈斗争的优秀战士们万岁。
