Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 29th: TASS, New York, 26th: At the recent annual meeting of the CIO Electrical Workers Union, the splitters headed by Carey suffered a miserable defeat. The annual meeting described the Carey group as a "gang of scoundrels" and passed a letter to all union members, exposing that after the Carey group, with the support of large companies, the reactionary leadership of the CIO, and reactionary newspapers, failed in its attempt to seize leadership of the union, it demanded that the CIO leadership allow them to establish a new electrical workers union in order to help large companies carry out the struggle against raising wages and improving working conditions. After condemning these scoundrels' despicable splitting activities, the annual meeting called on all members to unite against the capitalists and expel all scoundrels from the local branches.

The conference also passed resolutions granting the Executive Committee broad powers to expel splitters, retaining all membership privileges and rights of unemployed workers, and establishing a strike fund. At the meeting, the Carey group opposed giving unemployed workers the right to participate in the election of local union leaders and opposed the establishment of a strike fund.

After the Carey group's conspiracy to sabotage the union from within failed, it publicly declared its withdrawal from the Electrical Workers Union, formed a ten-member committee, and negotiated with CIO President Murray on the issue of establishing a new electrical workers union for the splitters. Murray recently threatened that the upcoming CIO annual meeting might expel the Electrical Workers Union and retaliate against the union's president, Fitzhoreed. However, the annual meeting still elected progressive leaders and demanded that the CIO terminate its dictatorial policies and restore the principles of democracy and non-interference in the union's internal affairs.

　　美电器工会年会上
   　工贼加莱惨败
    【新华社北京二十九日电】塔斯社纽约二十六日讯：在日前举行的产联电器工人工会年会上，以加莱为首的分裂分子遭受了惨败。年会形容加莱集团是“奸徒集团”，并通过告工会全体会员书，揭露加莱集团在大公司、产联反动领导机构与反动报纸支持下企图夺取工会领导权失败后，即要求产联领导机构让他们成立一个新的电器工会，以便帮助大公司进行反对提高工资和改善工作条件的斗争。年会于斥责这些奸徒的卑劣的分裂活动后，号召全体会员团结起来反对资本家，并把一切奸徒逐出各地方分会。
    大会并通过授予执行委员会开除分裂分子的广泛权力，及保留失业工人一切会员特权及权利，和设立罢工基金的决议。加莱集团在会上曾反对给失业工人以参加选举地方工会领袖之权，反对设立罢工基金等。
    加莱集团从内部破坏工会的阴谋失败后，就公开声明脱离电器工人工会，另组十人委员会，与产联主席莫莱谈判关于建立分裂分子的新电器工人工会问题。莫莱最近曾威胁称：行将举行的产联年会可能开除电器工会，并对该工会主席菲托霍雷德施行报复。但年会依然选举了进步的领袖，并要求产联终止独裁政策及恢复民主与不干涉工会内部事务的原则。
