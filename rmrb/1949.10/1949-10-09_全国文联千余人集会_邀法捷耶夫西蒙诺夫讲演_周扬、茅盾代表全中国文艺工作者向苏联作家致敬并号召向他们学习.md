　　National Federation of Literary and Art Circles Holds Gathering of Over 1,000 People
    Invites Fadeyev and Simonov to Give Lectures
    Zhou Yang and Mao Dun Represent All Chinese Literary and Art Workers in Paying Tribute to Soviet Writers and Call for Learning from Them
    [Our Newspaper’s News] Fadeyev, head of the Soviet cultural, artistic, and scientific workers delegation, and Simonov, the deputy head, gave lectures at Huairentang in Zhongnanhai yesterday afternoon (the 8th) at the invitation of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles. When the Soviet representatives entered the venue, the more than one thousand literary and art workers present applauded warmly. Zhou Yang, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, delivered a welcoming speech, saying: "We are particularly happy and honored to invite the world-renowned writers, our dearest friends Comrades Fadeyev and Simonov, to give lectures today. Their names are familiar and dear to the Chinese people and intellectuals. Their works, such as Fadeyev's "The Nineteen" and "The Young Guard," and Simonov's "Days and Nights" and "The Russian Question," are among our most beloved and cherished. Among all foreign literature, the works of Soviet writers and Russian classics have the deepest relationship and the greatest impact on the Chinese people and Chinese literature. As Lu Xun said, they have given the Chinese people many benefits. From Soviet works, we have seen the Russian people's perseverance in the revolutionary struggle, their struggle has brought light to the whole world, and in their struggle, under the education of Lenin and Stalin, they have cultivated the most perfect human character and the newest human type, the Soviet type. From Soviet works, we have seen the most advanced literature in the world—socialist realism literature. It is from Soviet works that we have learned how to fight for a better life, and we have been educated and encouraged. Soviet writers are the best teachers for the Chinese people, especially our literary and art workers."
    Fadeyev was unable to attend in person due to illness. He specially asked Xiao San to read his prepared lecture draft on his behalf. The topic was "On Socialist Realism" (the full text will be published on another day).
    Amidst long and enthusiastic applause, Simonov began his lecture. His topic was "Literature and Art and the State." He made a profound comparison between the fate of writers in socialist and capitalist societies and their position in social life (the full text will be published separately).
    Subsequently, the artist Finogenov and Rogov, head of the TASS Beijing branch, spoke successively, expressing their utmost joy and respect for the victory of the Chinese people and congratulating the Chinese people on the success of cultural construction.
    Finally, Mao Dun, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, thanked Fadeyev, Simonov, and Finogenov on behalf of the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles. He said: "Comrade Simonov told us that in a socialist country, the task of literary and art workers is to educate the people and serve the people. Vulgar literary works without educational significance have no possibility of existence in the Soviet Union. He also told us how to serve the people, how to get rid of the baggage of our own ideology, and how to integrate with the people and serve them more effectively." Finally, he paid high tribute to the Soviet writers on behalf of all Chinese literary and art workers and wished them great success. (Ji)

    法捷耶夫因病未能亲自出席，他临时特别请萧三代表他宣读他已拟好的讲演稿，讲题为“论社会主义现实主义”（全文另日发表）。
    在经久不息的热烈掌声中，西蒙诺夫开始了他的讲演，他的讲题是“文艺与国家”。他把在社会主义社会与资本主义社会中的作家的命运与他们在社会生活中的地位，作了深刻的对比（全文另发）。
    接着，美术家菲诺格诺夫、塔斯社北京分社社长罗果夫相继讲话，对于中国人民的胜利，表示万分欢欣与尊敬，并祝贺中国人民文化建设成功。
    最后，中华全国文学艺术界联合会茅盾副主席代表全国文联向法捷耶夫、西蒙诺夫、菲诺格诺夫致谢。他说：“西蒙诺夫同志告诉我们：在社会主义国家文艺工作者的任务是教育人民，为人民服务。没有教育意义的庸俗的文学作品在苏联没有存在之可能。他又告诉我们应如何为人民服务，应如何丢掉自己思想意识上的包袱，而和人民结合，更有效地为人民服务。”最后他代表全中国文艺工作者向苏联作家致崇高的敬意，并祝他们的伟大成功。　　　　（迹）
