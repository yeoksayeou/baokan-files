　　They Marched from the Songhua River to the Pearl River
    —A Record of Female Propagandists on the Southern Expedition
    Zou Shijin
    At the station of a certain unit of the Fourth Field Army in Jiangnan, this reporter interviewed the female comrades of the unit's propaganda team. They are a portion of the thousands of female soldiers in the Fourth Field Army, and they all walked from the Songhua River in the Northeast to Jiangnan. As I walked into their barracks with admiration, I said, "You've walked quite a bit!" Xiao Guang, the deputy squad leader, smiled and said, "Let's calculate! The distance in the Northeast is uncountable. It was a twenty-day march into the pass, walking more than 70 li every day, a total of more than 1,500 li; from Tianjin and Beiping south to Wuhan, a forty-day march, covering more than 2,200 li; after crossing the river, a twenty-day combat march, covering more than 1,400 li..." Then she calculated the distance of recent marches and estimated the distance to Guangzhou. She said with a smile, "Ah! The total is still less than 10,000 li; 25,000 li would be considered a Long March!"
    The march into the pass was during the severe winter season. Although they were carrying loads of more than 20 jin, including luggage, rations, and musical instruments, none of them fell behind. Bai Yuzhi said proudly, "We have never fallen behind. During the battle at Kouqian, 40 li from Jilin in the Northeast, we marched 150 li in half a day and a night of rapid marching. We followed one after another, the people behind grabbed the belts of the comrades in front, and none of them fell behind!" Once, when Yan Fei was making noodles for the sick, she dropped the knife on her foot, cutting a large gash. She still insisted on walking. Bai Yuzhi had several large blood blisters on her feet. Others advised her to take a car, but she said, "Let it hurt, I'll walk. No matter what, I won't let my feet fall off from the pain!" She continued to move forward cheerfully. They not only persisted in marching themselves but also actively did mass work and erected propaganda sheds during the march. Generally, the troops ate and set off at two o'clock in the morning. They had to get up two hours earlier, setting off at midnight. The troops rested after walking about 15 li, but they walked 40 or 50 li in one go, mobilizing the masses along the way to boil water. A short distance from the campsite, when the troops were most tired, they quickly set up a propaganda shed in front, and as soon as the troops arrived, they immediately started various performances, continuing until all the troops had passed, usually lasting four hours. After the troops had passed, they immediately packed up their luggage and rushed to the campsite to prepare for the next propaganda shed. Their arduous work style and selfless spirit moved the soldiers to say, "The female comrades are going ahead and coming behind to encourage us, giving us water to drink. How can we not overcome difficulties and persevere to the end?"
    After the troops crossed the river, it was the plum rain season in Jiangnan. They had no rain gear. It rained continuously for fifteen days without stopping. They marched in wet clothes during the day and slept in wet clothes at night. However, as soon as the sky cleared, the sun scorched like fire, and their bodies were always like they had taken a bath, full of sewage. However, sometimes they also helped the old cooks carry oil loads or marching pots. They did not shy away from the difficulties caused by physiological reasons. There were many rivers in the South, and many bridges were destroyed by the White bandits. They crossed rivers that were chest-deep every day, just like the soldiers. One day, they crossed twelve rivers in total, but they never complained. When the battle was tense, the leaders left them in the rear to take care of them. This was the most painful thing for them. On the march, they were a group of active and tireless motivators. During the garrison period, they were propagandists educating the residents. In battle, they were even more exemplary nurses, patiently caring for the wounded. They stayed up for several days and nights, wiping blood, applying dressings, feeding water and food to the wounded, and telling the wounded and sick about current affairs and reading model Party member textbooks. When seriously wounded soldiers lost too much blood, they rushed to donate blood. Because of these many achievements, they were honorably awarded a white silk certificate by the headquarters and political department of the unit.
    These female soldiers joined the army successively in the Northeast from 1945 to 1948. Because they suffered the enslavement of the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang bandit gang, they were able to work hard, selflessly, and resolutely for the liberation of the people. Now they have made all preparations for the victorious march into the Pearl River, challenging each other to realize their plans to perform meritorious services in the final battle to advance into the Pearl River and eliminate the remnants of the Jiang-Bai bandit gang.

　　她们从松花江走向珠江
    ——记南征中的女宣传员
    邹适今
    在江南第四野战军某部驻地，记者访问了该部宣传队的女同志。她们是第四野战军里千百个女战士中的一部分，她们都是从东北松花江徒步走到江南来的。记者以敬佩的心情走进她们的营房时说：“你们走的路可不少了！”副班长萧光笑着说：“算算看！在东北的算不清了。入关行军二十天，每天走七十多里，共一千五百多里；从平津南下到武汉，行军四十天，走了二千二百来里；渡江后战斗行军二十天，又走了一千四百来里……”接着她又计算了最近若干天进军的路程，又估计了到广州的路程，她笑着说：“啊！总共加起来也还不足一万里，二万五千里才算得长征呢！”
    入关行军时正是严寒季节，她们虽然背着足足二十多斤重的行装、干粮和乐器等，但没有一个掉队的。白玉芝骄傲地说：“我们从来没有掉过队。在东北离吉林四十里的口前战斗时，半天一夜急行军一百五十里，我们一个跟一个，后面的人抓住前面同志的皮带走，没有一个掉队！”有一次，阎飞给病号做面条，切刀掉在脚上，割了个大口子，她仍然坚持步行；白玉芝脚上打了好几个大血泡，别人劝她坐车，她说：“它痛它的，我走我的，无论如何不会把脚痛掉的！”依然愉快地前进。她们不但自己坚持行军，还在行军中积极地做群众工作和鼓动棚工作。部队一般在夜里两点吃饭出发，她们就要提前起床两个钟头，在午夜出发，部队大约走十五里一休息，她们却要一气走四五十里，沿途发动群众烧开水。离宿营地还有一小段路程的地方，是部队最感疲劳的时候，她们就迅速地在前面布置好鼓动棚，待部队一到，马上开始各种演唱，一直连续演唱到部队全部过完，一般总要四小时之久。部队过完了，她们又马上收拾好行装赶到宿营地去作下次鼓动棚的准备工作。她们的艰苦作风和忘我的工作精神，感动得战士们说：“女同志都赶前赶后来鼓励咱，给咱烧水喝，咱们还能不克服困难坚持到底？”
    部队渡江后，正值江南黄梅雨季。她们没有任何防雨的工具。曾经有十五天不停止地下着连绵雨，她们白天穿着湿衣服行军，夜里就穿着湿衣服睡觉。但是，天一放晴，太阳又象火一样的烤人，身上永远象洗了澡，尽是污水。但是她们有时候还帮助老炊事员挑油担子或行军锅。她们并不讳言由于生理原因所引起的困难。南方河流多，许多桥梁都被白匪破坏。她们每天都和战士们一样涉过没胸的河水，有一天她们整整过了十二条河，但是她们始终没有叫过苦。在战斗紧张时，上级为了照顾她们，把她们留在后方。这反而是她们最感痛苦的事情。她们在行军中是一群活跃的，不知疲倦的鼓动者，在驻军的时期是对居民进行教育的宣传员，在战斗中她们更是耐心体贴伤员的模范护士。她们曾经数昼夜不合眼给伤号擦血敷伤，喂水喂饭，和给伤病员讲时事，念模范党员课本。当重伤员流血过多时，她们又争先恐后地输血。由于她们的这许多功绩，她们光荣的获得了该部司令部和政治部联衔颁发给她们的白绸奖状。
    这些女战士们，是一九四五年到一九四八年在东北先后参军的。由于她们受尽了日寇和国民党匪帮的奴役，所以她们能为老百姓的解放而艰苦地、忘我地、坚毅地工作着，现在她们已经作好了胜利进军珠江的一切准备，彼此挑战，要以最大的努力在最后进军珠江，消灭蒋白残匪的战斗中，实现自己的立功计划。
