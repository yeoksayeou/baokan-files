Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 6th—American Communist Leaders Send Telegram to Chairman Mao to Congratulate the Founding of Our Central People's Government; Chairman Mao Sends Telegram in Reply to Foster and Dennis to Express Thanks

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 6th: William Z. Foster, National Chairman, and Eugene Dennis, General Secretary, of the Communist Party of the United States, sent a long telegram from New York on the 3rd of this month to congratulate Chairman Mao Zedong. The full text is as follows:

To Chairman Mao Zedong, People’s Republic of China, Beijing:

We hail the establishment of the Central Government of the People's Republic of China. This is a historically significant and glorious event, foreshadowing the end of the century of imperialist rule, especially the failure of Wall Street's heinous policy of reactionary interference in the internal affairs of the great Chinese people. It marks the liberation of nearly a quarter of humanity from the chains of feudalism and colonialism and promotes the national liberation struggles of colonial peoples everywhere. It places liberated China in an important position in the ranks of the new people's democratic countries and puts China on the solid path of social progress and the ultimate realization of socialism. This great achievement, attained under the leadership of the Communist Party and its heroic People's Liberation Army, is one of the great events in human history. It is undoubtedly one of the most significant events in the world since the epoch-making October Socialist Revolution (whose consolidation and victory paved the way for China's liberation). Because of your victory, the world camp of peace, democracy, and socialism has been infinitely strengthened, and the camp of imperialism, reaction, and atomic warfare, headed by Wall Street, has been greatly weakened and undermined. The establishment of the Central Government of the People's Republic of China has further isolated and rendered powerless Wall Street's despicable Chinese puppets, its reactionary and traitorous Chiang Kai-shek, and other Kuomintang elements stationed in the United States and the United Nations. It has strengthened the peace-loving forces in the United States and the world. They are increasingly and effectively resisting and opposing the shameful policy of war-mongering of the Wall Street bipartisan imperialist government. You can be assured that the majority of the American people rejoice in your victory. They will oppose any attempt by imperialists to undermine China's national sovereignty or obstruct the construction of a new People's China. They are vehemently opposed to the disastrous policies of the U.S. military command and the State Department. They also believe that the need to establish close and friendly relations with the new China is an important way to alleviate the turmoil and suffering inflicted on the American masses by the developing economic crisis. They are jointly and forcefully demanding the establishment of large-scale commercial relations with China on an equal footing and the early establishment of diplomatic relations with your new government. Progressive Americans hail China's liberation and recognize its enormous contribution to world peace and democracy. We Communists and militant workers extend special respect to the heroism, loyalty, and leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and are proud that the rationality of the glorious science of Marxism-Leninism has been proven once again. On behalf of our Communist Party and the eleven Communist leaders on trial in Foley Square for opposing Wall Street's imperialist movement seeking world domination, war, and fascism, we salute Comrade Mao's brilliant and steadfast leadership. We salute your colleagues who jointly lead the new People's Government with you. Through you, we extend our congratulations to the Chinese people and offer our warm friendship and concern. We most earnestly hope that peace and prosperity will be rapidly consolidated, and that the great People's Republic of China will advance forever victoriously.

The National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States
William Z. Foster, National Chairman
Eugene Dennis, General Secretary

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 6th: Chairman Mao Zedong today sent a telegram in reply to the congratulations from the leaders of the Communist Party of the United States, Foster and Dennis. The telegram reads:

Dear Comrades Foster, Dennis, and all Comrades of the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States!

Thank you very much for your warm congratulations on the founding of the People's Republic of China. Please convey my thanks to all members of the Communist Party of the United States, and to all Americans who love peace and justice and have goodwill towards the Chinese people.

As you said, the victory of the Chinese people is a victory for imperialism, primarily American imperialism. This victory is part of the result of the overall struggle waged by the working class and progressive mankind throughout the world against the world imperialist camp. In this struggle, the American Communists and all sincere democrats are fighting alongside the Chinese people.

The American Communists enjoy a special and glorious position in the heroic struggle to aid the just cause of the Chinese people and to resist the reactionary China policy of American imperialism. Despite the savage persecution of the Communist Party of the United States and progressive forces in the United States by the reactionary American government, and the illegal trial of the eleven leaders of the Communist Party of the United States, namely Comrades Dennis, Williamson, Winston, Stacher, Davis, Winter, Thompson, Gates, Potash, Green, and Hall, the fact remains that the Communist Party of the United States and the progressive forces in the United States are correct, the friends of China of the Communist Party of the United States and the progressive forces in the United States are victorious, while the current imperialist government of the United States, which violates justice and therefore has failed shamefully. This fact cannot but encourage all democratic forces in the world who are temporarily still in a position of being oppressed, and cannot but educate all people in the world who are temporarily still under the rule and deception of the reactionaries.

Long live the friendship between the Chinese and American peoples!

Mao Zedong
October 6, 1949

　　美共领袖电贺毛泽东主席
    庆祝我中央人民政府成立
    毛主席电复福斯特、但尼斯致谢
    【新华社北京六日电】美国共产党全国主席福斯特和总书记但尼斯本月三日自纽约以长电祝贺毛泽东主席。全文如下：
    北京中华人民共和国主席毛泽东：
    我们欢呼中华人民共和国中央政府的成立。这是一个具有历史意义的与光荣的事件，预示着帝国主义统治之世纪的结束，特别是华尔街对于伟大中国人民之内政进行反动干涉的罪恶政策的失败。这标志着近四分之一的人类由封建主义与殖民主义的锁链下解放出来，并推进了各地殖民地人民的民族解放斗争。这使解放了的中国在新人民民主国家的队伍中居于重要地位，并使中国走上社会进步和最后实现社会主义的坚实道路。这一在共产党与它所领导的英勇解放军的领导下达到的伟大成就，是人类历史上伟大的事件之一。它无疑是划时代的十月社会主义革命（它的巩固和胜利铺平了中国解放的道路）以来世界上最重大的事件之一。由于你们的胜利，世界和平、民主与社会主义阵营无限地加强了，以华尔街为首的帝国主义、反动与原子战争阵营大大地削弱和破坏了。中华人民共和国中央政府的成立使华尔街的卑贱的中国傀儡，它的反动卖国的蒋介石及驻在美国及联合国的其他国民党分子，更加孤立和无能为力了。它增强了美国和世界的爱好和平的力量。他们正在愈来愈有效地抵抗和反对华尔街两党帝国主义政府的贩卖战争的可耻政策。你们可以相信，大多数美国人民都因你们的胜利而欢欣。他们将反对帝国主义分子破坏中国国家主权或阻挠新的人民中国之建设的一切企图。他们猛力反对美国军事指挥部和国务院的灾难性政策。他们并且认为需要与新中国建立密切友好的关系，作为缓和发展中的经济危机给予美国群众的混乱与苦难的一个重要方法。他们正在共同地有力地要求在平等的基础上与中国开建大规模的商业关系，并早日与贵国的新政府建立外交关系。进步的美国人欢呼中国的解放并认识它对世界和平与民主的巨大贡献。我们共产党人和战斗的工人谨向中国共产党的英雄主义，忠贞和领导作用表示特别的尊敬，并对于马列主义光荣科学的合理性的又得到一次证明感到骄傲。代表我国共产党，代表因反对华尔街寻求世界统治、战争与法西斯主义的帝国主义运动而在福莱广场受审的十一名共产党领袖，我们谨向毛同志的光辉的和坚定的领导致敬。我们谨向和你共同领导新人民政府的你的同事们致敬。经过你，我们向中国人民致贺并献出我们的热情的友谊和关切。我们最热切希望和平与繁荣得以迅速巩固起来，伟大的中华人民共和国永远胜利前进。
        美国共产党全国委员会　全国主席威廉·福斯特　总书记尤琴·但尼斯
    【新华社北京六日电】毛泽东主席本日电复美国共产党领袖福斯特和但尼斯的祝贺。电称：
    亲爱的福斯特同志，但尼斯同志，和美国共产党全国委员会的全体同志们！
    十分感谢你们对于中华人民共和国成立的热烈祝贺。请将我的谢意转达给美国共产党全体党员，转达给全美国一切爱好和平正义和对中国人民怀有善意的人们。
    诚如你们所说，中国人民的胜利是对于帝国主义首先是美国帝国主义的胜利。这个胜利，是全世界工人阶级和进步人类对于世界帝国主义阵营所进行的总的斗争的结果之一部分，在这个斗争中，美国的共产党人和一切真诚的民主分子是与中国人民并肩作战的。
    美国共产党人在援助中国人民的正义事业而反抗美国帝国主义的反动对华政策的英勇奋斗中，享有一个特殊光荣的地位。尽管美国反动政府野蛮地迫害美国共产党和美国进步势力，非法地审讯美国共产党的十一位领袖，即但尼斯同志，威廉姆森同志，温斯顿同志，斯塔彻同志，戴维斯同志，温特同志，汤姆森同志，盖兹同志，波达许同志，格林同志和贺尔同志，但是事实毕竟表明了，正确的是美国共产党和美国进步势力，胜利的是美国共产党和美国进步势力的中国友人，而违反正义并因此可耻地失败了的则是美国现在的帝国主义政府。这个事实，不能不鼓励全世界一切暂时尚处于被压迫地位的民主力量，不能不教育全世界一切暂时尚处于反动派统治和蒙蔽下的人民。
    中美两国人民友谊万岁！
    　　　　　　　　　　　　毛泽东　　一九四九年十月六日
