　　Folk Legend of the "Red Army Forefather"
　　In Dongchuankou, Yunxi County, near the border of Xunyang, Shaanxi, the people spontaneously erected a seated statue of a Red Army soldier wearing an octagonal hat and military uniform in the main hall of an ancient temple called Yangyu Cave. This was to commemorate a Red Army cadre who sacrificed in Chuantanping, Xunyang, more than twenty miles from the area, when the 25th Red Army passed through Hubei and Shaanxi in 1935. The body of this Red Army cadre was buried by the local people at the foot of the mountain at Liangzi, Yuhuang Temple. Although this solitary grave was only a pile of yellow earth and some rubble, it has been worshiped and offered sacrifices by the nearby working people all year round. After the Red Army statue was built, this ancient temple, whose name had been lost for many years, acquired a new name - "Red Army Forefather Temple." And this Red Army tomb was also called "Red Army Forefather Tomb."
　　The impression the Red Army left in the hearts of the people is very deep, and the Red Army has become deified in the hearts of the people, and thus a series of myths have emerged.
　　There is such a legend: A family in Dachougou, Shuhe, was sick, and a passerby brought many medicines and cured the whole family. Before leaving, they asked for his name and address so that they could thank him. He only said that he lived in a certain place. Later, the family went to that place to look for him, but there was no such person, only a solitary grave where the Red Army was buried. So the family was convinced that it was the "Red Army showing its holiness" and that the person who treated the illness was the incarnation of the Red Army. They not only piously worshiped at the Red Army tomb, but also year after year, often remembered the kindness of the Red Army, and became the disseminators of this myth.
　　"The Red Army is the savior of the poor."
　　"When the poor are in trouble, the Red Army will come to help."
　　Residents living near this Red Army tomb, and even residents hundreds of miles away, if they were sick and could not afford a doctor, would go to burn incense and make a wish to ask the "Red Army Forefather" for help. Therefore, the ashes in front of the tomb were also taken back as elixirs to comfort the sick; even a wild grass growing on the tomb was taken back as a fairy grass to treat the sick. The sick were comforted spiritually, their minds were calmed, and the illness would gradually improve. In this way, more and more myths were spread, and the "Red Army Forefather" took root in the hearts of the people. It is said that there are people in Baihe and Mancheng Pass and other places who worship the "Red Army Forefather." Today, the people in this area have been liberated, and the savior that the people have been piously waiting for has really appeared before the people. More than ten years have passed since the 25th Red Army passed by, and the people's expectations have finally been realized. How much hardship and bitterness have the people gone through in these long years!
　　It is natural for the people to deify the Red Army. But we should rescue them from this superstitious thinking, raise their class consciousness, and guide their kind desires to the path of actual struggle and science and truth, so that they can exert their potential power in the construction of a new life!

### 民间传说“红军老祖”

　　民间传说“红军老祖”
    靠近陕西洵阳边境上的郧西县东川口地方的人民，自发地在一个名叫洋遇洞的一座古庙的正殿上塑了一个头戴八角帽身穿军服的红军坐像。这是为了纪念一九三五年红二十五军经过鄂陕时，牺牲于距该地二十多里洵阳境内川潭坪的一个红军干部的。这位红军干部的尸体，就被当地人民埋葬在该地玉皇庙梁子的山脚边，这座孤坟虽仅是一堆黄土和一些乱石砌成的，可是却常年享受着附近劳动人民的祭祀和供拜。红军像塑成后，这座年久失传的古庙便获得了新的命名——“红军老祖庙”。而这座红军坟墓也就被称为“红军老祖墓”。
    红军在人民心里留下的印象是很深的，红军在人民的心头便神化起来了，于是便出现了一连串的神话。
    有这样一个传说：蜀河大泥沟有一家人病了，一个过路的人携了许多药，把这一家子的病都治好了。临走问他姓名住址以便酬谢，他仅说了住某地，后来这家子到该地去找并无其人，只有一座埋葬红军的孤坟，于是这家子便确信是“红军显圣”，那个看病的就是红军的化身。他不仅在红军墓前虔诚地祭奠过，而且年年月月，时常感念着这红军的恩德，成了这神话的宣传者。
    “红军是穷人的救星。”
    “穷人有难，红军就会来搭救”。
    住在这红军墓附近的居民，甚至百数十里以外的居民，有了病请不起医生的，都要去烧香许愿求“红军老祖”施救。于是，坟前的香灰，也被当作仙丹取回去安慰病者；甚至坟头上长的一株野草，也被当作仙草取回去为病者治疗了。病者获得心灵上的安慰，心境宁静，病势也就会渐渐好一点。这样，神话就愈传愈多，“红军老祖”便在人民的心灵上生了根。据说白河及漫川关等地都有供奉“红军老祖”的人们。　今天这一带地方的人民已被解放，人民虔诚等待的救星真的出现在人民面前，自红二十五军过后十余年以来，人民的期待终于实现了，人民在这漫长的岁月中，经过了多少辛酸苦涩啊！
    人民把红军神化起来，这是很自然的。可是我们应该把他们从这种迷信思想中拯救出来，提高他们的阶级觉悟，把他们这种善良的企求引导到实际斗争和科学与真理的大道上去，使他们在新的生活的建设中，发挥他们潜在的力量！
