Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 16th—More than 30 counties in the Guanzhong New District of Shaanxi Province are about to hold farmers' representative conferences to organize farmers' forces and gradually carry out rural reforms. The first farmers' representative conference in Chang'an County was held in Xi'an from the 8th to the 10th of this month. Two hundred and seventy-seven farmer representatives attended. On the first day of the conference, Xi Zhongxun, Secretary of the Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, attended and delivered a speech. After analyzing the current rural situation in the county, he called on all farmers in the county to organize themselves, unite into a strong force, and, under the leadership of unified policies, completely overthrow the current ruling clique of the main enemy of the countryside—the landlord class. He pointed out that the main tasks of the rural areas in the county are: supporting the front lines, opposing local tyrants and evil gentry, opposing special agents, eliminating bandits, organizing non-detached production militia self-defense teams, protecting homes and defending against bandits, implementing rent and interest reduction, and improving farmers' lives. In his speech, Xi Zhongxun especially taught the working cadres: Our staff must understand that we are the soldiers of the people and the long-term workers of the people, and we must humbly learn from the masses and listen to the management and education of the shopkeeper (the people). Only in this way can we learn valuable knowledge from the masses and in turn become teachers of the masses. On the second day of the conference, representatives from various places successively accused the feudal forces of oppressing and exploiting the peasants, and demanded unity, the organization of farmers' associations, and the overthrow of feudal rule. On the third day of the conference, the "Provisional Measures for Rent and Interest Reduction in Chang'an County" were discussed and approved to unite all working farmers and gradually eliminate the feudal system. At the same time, the meeting also formulated the "Provisional Measures for Rent and Interest Reduction in Chang'an County", which was submitted to the All-Circles People's Representative Conference of the county held on the 12th of this month for discussion. Finally, the conference elected 25 people as members of the Provisional Committee of the Farmers' Association of the county, with Li Hao, deputy secretary of the County Committee of the Communist Party of China, as the director.

    【新华社西安十六日电】陕西关中新区三十余县，即将分别举行农民代表会议，以组织农民力量，逐步进行农村改革。长安县首次农民代表会议已于本月八日至十日在西安市举行。出席农民代表二百七十七人。大会第一日，中共中央西北局书记习仲勋亲临讲话。他在分析目前该县的农村情况后，号召全县农民组织起来，团结成为一个坚强的力量，在统一的政策领导下，彻底打倒目前农村的主要敌人——地主阶级的当权派。他指出目前该县农村的主要工作是：支援前线反对恶霸，反对特务，肃清土匪，组织不脱离生产的民兵自卫队，保家防匪，实行减租减息，改善农民生活等。习仲勋在讲话中特别教导工作干部们说：我们工作人员一定要懂得我们是人民的兵，是人民的长工，必须虚心向群众学习，听从掌柜的（人民）的管教。只有这样，才能够从群众那里学习宝贵的知识，才可以反过来当群众的先生。大会第二日，各地代表纷纷控诉封建势力对农民的压迫和剥削，要求团结起来，组织农会，打倒封建统治。大会第三日讨论并通过组织长安县农民协会临时委员会，以团结全体劳动农民，逐步消灭封建制度。同时，会议并制定了“长安县减租减息暂行办法”，提交本月十二日召开的全县各界人民代表会议讨论。最后，大会选出二十五人为该县农民协会临时委员会委员，该县中共县委副书记李浩任主任委员。
