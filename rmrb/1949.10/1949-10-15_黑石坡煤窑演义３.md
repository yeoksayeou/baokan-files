　　The Black Stone Slope Coal Mine Chronicles 3
　　Kang Zhuo
　　　　Three Brothers
　　Da San returned to the village, not resting much, nor visiting around to look for people, but focused on looking at the mining area, planning, estimating how many people and how much work would be needed, how much capital, and what furniture to prepare. The owner, Xilu, was also in high spirits at the time, more generous, and not very stingy with spending, and he kept saying that everything depended on Da San's actions. Da San was doing well, and after more than half a month, the preparations for opening the kiln were complete, so he discussed starting work with Xilu.
　　Xilu wanted a bit of a show, and the village elders also told him to make a bit of noise. So he asked a feng shui master to pick an auspicious day to start work, and also decided to put on a show and make offerings to the bodhisattvas and Lord Lao who oversee the kiln, and wanted Da San to arrange all this. Da San didn't know how to do these things, and didn't find them interesting, so he declined. Xilu then followed Da San's lead and told Da San to rest well, and handed the arrangements over to Yubao. So Da San finally managed to rest for two days.
　　But Da San was never one to rest. These days, apart from Little Foreign Devil and the Liu family who invariably came to his house to sit, there were no other relatives or friends. Da San couldn't help but feel bored. Every day, with nothing to do, he could only talk to his second brother and his wife, and ask about the various events in the village over the years, passing the time while waiting for work to begin.
　　His second brother, named Tianlu, was his uncle's second son. Da San grew up with his uncle, and grew up and went down the kiln with Tianlu. Tianlu was also tall and large, his body as black as coal, impossible to wash clean. His face was so black that nothing could be distinguished, only a pair of eyes gleaming, and a head full of white hair. He rarely spoke. He supported his family of five, wife and children, and was never at home all day. In winter and spring, he worked in the local kilns. In summer and autumn, he went to the big kilns in Liugou. His family rented a few acres of land from the wealthy Zhang Jubao, but his wife and children couldn't manage to cultivate it all. During the busy farming season, he would come back from the kiln in the afternoon and work in the fields until dark, sleep for a while, and then go down the kiln again the next morning. After Da San returned to the village, he sometimes sought Da San for a chat, but he didn't speak, just squatted in the corner smoking. When Da San asked something, he would say a word or two. If not asked, he would stay for a while, and then leave silently. He lived in the same courtyard as Da San, a courtyard with four rooms. His eldest brother had died early, so he and Da San each had two rooms. But one of his rooms had collapsed, so he had long since occupied both of Da San's rooms. Now he gave one room back to Da San, but his family of five, plus the kitchen and other things, were really cramped. Da San couldn't bear it, and thought of finding another place to live and returning the room to him, but he wouldn't allow it, saying, "If you do that, how can I, as your brother, be at ease? I won't be able to sleep." Da San and Tianlu were like fire and cotton, completely different. According to Da San's temperament, he would simply ignore people. But Tianlu was Da San's only relative, and for some reason, Da San didn't dislike Tianlu, but felt that he was a rare good person, like an old friend named Lao Bai: Lao Bai also didn't say a word, worked desperately in the kiln all day, and although his skills were good, he invariably suffered bullying from the foremen and lackeys. He didn't speak when he was bullied, but just sent his wages home, not eating, drinking, or wearing anything himself, not even smoking, and often advised Da San to speak less and get less angry, and to spend money frugally. Now, Da San sometimes felt sorry for Tianlu, like Lao Bai. But sometimes he also felt a little afraid of Tianlu, like he used to be afraid of Lao Bai. He couldn't say why he was afraid of them, but he kept their words in his heart and wouldn't forget them.
　　However, these days, when Da San talked to Tianlu about the various affairs in the village, Tianlu couldn't say anything. He only said to Da San, "We can't even take care of our own family, how can we manage those idle matters!" He also advised Da San, "What do you care about those idle matters for! You finally made it home, you should carefully plan to make a living!" Then, he told Da San to live more carefully, arrange his clothes and meals properly. Da San couldn't even remember his parents' birthdays and death anniversaries, and he told Da San these things, telling Da San to remember the dates, burn some paper money, and kowtow… Da San really didn't know how to answer when he heard these things. He only felt that his second brother was really a good person, but he also felt that the village was meaningless. He thought of opening the kiln as soon as possible, so that he could go out again next spring.
　　A few days later, the village had a theatrical performance. Da San listened to Tianlu's words, kowtowed twice at the Lord Lao Temple, and walked out of the temple gate. He saw that the foot of the stage was crowded and noisy, and thought, how could he possibly watch the show? He turned and walked home. Walking into his own courtyard, his second sister-in-law asked him, "Third brother! Aren't you going to watch the show?" He said, "I don't want to. Aren't you going?" His second sister-in-law said, "I've wanted to see the show for a long time! But look, the Frost's Descent solar term has long passed, and your second brother hasn't put on his jacket yet! Just this tattered rag, is this what you call a jacket! He's been wearing it for ten years, how can he wear it without mending it! Sigh! And the children are always clinging to you!" Da San asked, "Has Second Brother gone to see the show?" His second sister-in-law said, "See the show! He did say a long time ago that he would definitely watch it this time. But he hasn't come back yet!" As they were talking, Tianlu returned. After a while, Little Foreign Devil and the Liu family also came. As soon as the Liu family entered the door, they shouted, "Uncle Da San! Who are you staying home to guard? Why aren't you going to watch the show?" Little Foreign Devil said, "I couldn't find you anywhere under the stage, then people said they saw you at home. Let's go, Uncle Da San! It's a good show! 'Butterfly Cup'! You can't miss this." Da San said to Tianlu, "Second Brother, are you going?" The Liu family said, "Let's go, Uncle Da San! Uncle Tianlu doesn't want to watch the show!" Da San still said to Tianlu, "Let's go, Second Brother, let's go together!" Little Foreign Devil also ran up and pulled Tianlu, saying, "Go! Just accompany your third brother!" Tianlu said, "I still have to fetch water!" Tianlu's wife said, "Go! There's still water." So the four of them went to see the show together.

　　黑石坡煤窑演义３
    康濯
        三　弟兄
    大三回到村里，没怎么歇着，也没串门子寻人捣拉，就紧着看矿区，盘算计划，估量用多少人多少工多少垫本，置备什么家具；东家喜禄当时也正在劲头上，手面也大些，花钱上头也不很克索，并且他还口口声声说着：一切都靠给大三行事，大三干得还顺手，半月多工夫，开窑的事准备停当，就和喜禄商议动工。
    喜禄隙想多少闹点排场，村里社首们也都叫他闹一闹，于是他请阴阳先生看了动工的日子，又决定要唱唱戏敬敬管窑的菩萨老君爷，并要大三张罗这一切；大三对这些却不摸门道，也不觉兴味，就推脱不干，喜禄便也顺着大三的劲，忙叫大三好好休息休息，并把张罗的事情交给了玉宝。这么下来，大三才摸着歇了两天。
    但大三这人从来就歇不住的，这些天村里除开小洋鬼和柳沟家短不了去他家坐坐，别也没什么亲戚朋友，大三不免有些发闷；每天没事，就只好找他老二两口子说说话，顺便问讯问讯这些年村里的各种事体，这么打发日子，等着开工。
    却说他老二名叫天禄，是他大爷的二小，大三从小跟着大爷过，就是和天禄一块长大一块下窑的。天禄也长得高身大架，一身隙跟炭一般黑，洗也洗不干净，脸上黑得什么也分不清，只见一对眼珠闪动，还有满脑袋的白头发。他这人轻易不说话，一个人养活一家老婆孩子五口，也成天不在家；冬春是本村下窑，夏秋上柳沟大窑动弹，家里租种大财主张聚宝几亩地，老婆孩子养种不过，他农忙时节半后晌从窑底下工回来，还要上地去，直干到天黑，回来睡上一觉，第二天大早，就又下窑去。大三回村以后，他有时也找大三歇歇，但他不说话，只是一个人圪＠到墙角落抽烟，大三问什么，他就说句把，不问，他呆半天，又不声不响地走了。他跟大三同住一院，院里四间房，他哥哥老大早死了，正好他跟大三一人两间，但他的却塌了一间，所以他早就把大三的两间也住下了；现在让了一间给大三，他五口人加上厨房什么的，实在挤不下，大三也看不过意，想出去另找住处，把房还腾给他，他却怎么也不让，连说：“那么着，我作哥哥的可怎么也安不下心，睡不着觉。”大三又要他拾掇那间塌了的房，他说行，却总没动手；大三知道他是手头没钱，也盘算过自己出钱找人修整，但老二知道了，有天黑夜，他就去大三屋里圪＠了半宿，来回说着这几句话道：“可不能啊老三！你这房我住了多年，没掏一个房租，这如今我还占着一间，我可是成天安不下心哩！你再要给我拾掇房，你说我这心可往那里搁？老三，不能啊！”大三跟天禄，真好比是一团火跟一堆棉花，完完全全两个样，依着大三的脾性，会干脆不搭理人家的；但天禄是大三仅有的一个亲人，而且也不知道为什么，大三并不讨厌天禄，倒觉得他是个少见的好人，跟他外边一个叫老白的朋友一样：那老白也是不说一句话，整天在窑底死命干，把式也不赖，却短不了受工头狗腿们欺负，受了欺负他也不说话，只是领了工钱就寄回家去，自己不吃不喝不穿，连旱烟也不抽，还短不了打劝大三，叫他少说话少动气，叫他花钱省俭。现在，大三有时也觉得天禄可怜，象老白一样；但有时又觉着自己好象有些怕天禄，跟他过去有些怕老白一般，他也说不出为啥怕人家，只是人家说的话，他总结记在心中。不会忘记。
    不过，这些天来，大三跟天禄捣拉村里各种事体，天禄却什么也说不出，他只对大三道：“咱自己一家子还顾不住的，哪能管那些个闲事啊！”他又打劝大三：“你管那些个闲事干什么！你好不容易熬回了家，也该往仔细里盘算过个光景哩！”接着，他就要大三日子过得细致些，穿衣吃饭安排得到实些；大三连自己父母生辰忌日也记不得了，他又把这些告给大三，叫大三结记着日子，去烧个纸叩个头………大三听了这些，真不知怎么张嘴答话；他只觉得他老二真是个好人，却又觉得这村里没什么意思，他并想着赶早把窑开成，到来年春天，他还是出去的好。
    过了几天，村里唱戏了。大三听了天禄的话，上老君庙叩了两个头，走出庙门，只见戏楼根又挤又闹，心想这还能看上戏么？就扭头往家走。走进自己院里，他二嫂问他：“三兄弟！你也不看戏？”他道：“不想看。你不去么？”二嫂说：“戏可是早就想去看嘛！可就这；你看，节气早过了霜降，你老二还没穿上袄！就这么件破布烂套子衣裳，这也叫袄呀！穿了十来年，不补补可怎么往身上披啊！唉！孩孩们又整天缠住你的！”大三问道：“老二看戏去了？”二嫂道：“看戏！他倒早就说来着，说是这回可准得看看的；可这会他还没回哩！”他们正说着，天禄回了。一会，小洋鬼跟柳沟家也来了，柳沟家一进门就嚷道：“大三叔！你在家里呆着守住谁啊？怎么也不去看个烘火？”小洋鬼道：“我在戏楼底哪里也寻不见你，后来人们说见你在家里。走吧，大三叔！好戏！‘蝴蝶杯’！这可是不能不看。”大三对天禄道：“老二，你去不？”柳沟家说：“走吧大三叔！天禄叔他还舍得看戏的？”大三还是对天禄说：“走吧老二，咱们相跟上去！”小洋鬼也跑上去拉住天禄道：“去吧！你就陪你三兄弟去去！”天禄说：“我还要担水哩！”天禄他女人说：“去吧！水还有。”这四个人才一道看戏去了。
