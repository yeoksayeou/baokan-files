What Labor Has Given Me
    Min Ni
    A year ago, I participated in farming, planting sorghum. All the production tools were borrowed, and the only thing missing was livestock. The farmers were also busy planting. What to do? At that time, it was decided to form groups of seven or eight people to pull a seeder to sow the land. We intellectuals, after pulling for only two rows, were breathless and sweating profusely. We felt that we were truly weak and incompetent in labor. There was no reason to look down on labor in the past, and it was very shameful to look down on working people.
    Seeing a farmer nearby driving a tall donkey to sow the land, doing it faster, neater, and better than us, I immediately felt: how great it would be to have a donkey! After having this feeling, I developed a special love for livestock, and no longer walked past them holding my nose, as I used to. At the same time, I understood why farmers cherished their livestock so much. Without livestock, how difficult it would be to farm!
    When the seedlings grew, we went to thin them and pull weeds. When I saw the tender green seedlings, it was as if they had already grown into tall, large, fiery red sorghum ears. I was extremely happy and had a healthy desire to create through labor. Thinning the seedlings and pulling the weeds became much easier.
    Also, what was originally a barren land is now a field of tender green crops. The face of nature has been changed, and something has been produced. Labor creates everything, and I personally tasted a bit of that truth.
    Later, in labor, my thoughts became more and more numerous. If I were a farmer, working hard to grow sorghum and relying on it for food, what would I do if it were exploited by the landlord? I would certainly hate the landlord class's exploitation. And if I relied on farming for a living but had no land, how much would I yearn for a piece of land... Therefore, I wholeheartedly support eliminating feudalism and implementing "land to the tiller."
    When the autumn harvest came, the farmers' vitality and joy in labor were fully expressed in threshing, rolling, and winnowing. As a participant, it is impossible for me not to sing the praises of labor, not to sing the praises of working people—the masters who create the world! That is already impossible.

　　劳动给了我什么
    敏妮
    在一年以前，我参加过种地，种的是高粱。什么生产工具都借好了，最后只差牲口，农民们也正忙着种地，那怎么办？那时决定七八个人一小组，拉一个耠子来耩地。我们这些知识分子，拉不到两垄，就上气不接下气，淌着大汗，感到自己在劳动上实在软弱无能，过去轻视劳动，是没有理由的，过去瞧不起劳动人民，是很羞耻的。
    看看附近有个农民赶着一头高个驴在耩地，比我们耩的又快又整齐好看，我马上感到：有一头驴多好？我有了这个感觉以后，对牲口不知怎的，却特别爱起来，也不象过去扪着鼻子走过牲口了，同时了解了农民为什么那样爱护他的牲口，如果没有牲口，种起地来，那会多困难啊！
    当幼苗长出来了，去按苗拔草。我看见了嫩绿的幼苗，就好象它们已长成为很高的、大棵的、火红的高粱穗了，心中欢喜极了，有了健康的劳动创作欲望，按起苗来，拔起草来，也轻快多了。
    还有原来是一块荒地，现在是一片嫩绿嫩绿的庄稼，改变了自然的面貌，生产了东西，劳动创造一切，亲身尝到了一点滋味。
    往后，在劳动中我的想法，越来越多了。假如：我是农民，辛苦种出来的高粱，又指望着这个吃饭，一旦被地主剥削去了，我要怎么办？那一定仇恨地主阶级的剥削；又如果我靠种地过日子，没有土地，那我是多么渴望一块土地呢……因此，消灭封建和实行耕者有其田，我是打心底拥护的。
    当秋收来到，农民们劳动的活力和愉快，完全表现在打场、压场、扬掀等劳动上。我是一个亲身参加者，要我不歌唱劳动，不歌唱劳动人民——这创造世界的主人！那已经是不可能的事情。
