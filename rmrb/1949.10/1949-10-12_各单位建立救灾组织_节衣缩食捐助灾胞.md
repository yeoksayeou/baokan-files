　　All Units Establish Disaster Relief Organizations
    Practice Thrift and Donate to Disaster-Stricken Compatriots

    [Report from this newspaper] Various agencies and military units in Beijing have successively launched a thrift and disaster relief campaign. The North China Military Region Infantry School, the Beijing Garrison Headquarters, and the headquarters of a certain People's Liberation Army special forces unit have all established disaster relief committees or thrift groups, under the leadership of the Party Committee, to be responsible for promoting long-term thrift and disaster relief work. Cadres and soldiers have also actively donated their stored clothing and other items. The Infantry School and the Garrison Headquarters have also proposed saving one or two liang of coal per person per day, strengthening water and electricity conservation, and tightening office expenses. According to incomplete statistics for about half a month, the General Branch Committee and the First Battalion of the Garrison Headquarters alone have donated 109 pairs of shoes, 28 pairs of socks, a total of 181 pieces of clothing, one woolen sweater, one flannel shirt, 120 towels, 15,300 yuan in People's Currency, and some other miscellaneous items. The preparatory committee of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions has collectively donated more than 5,900 jin of millet since the 20th of last month. Most donated 30 jin or more, and the most donated was 150 jin. The above donations of millet will be converted into cash monthly from October onwards, to be paid in full over half a year. The Federation has formed a disaster relief branch and is forming disaster relief sub-branches in its affiliated industrial trade unions, factory trade unions, and district offices. In addition to saving one or two liang of rice per day for disaster relief, the employees of this newspaper also donated 3,342 jin of millet, 55,000 yuan in People's Currency, 73 sets of cotton, single, and夹 clothing, and some other items in three days. In addition, 14 faculty and staff members of the First Central School in the 13th district of Beijing plan to donate 39 jin of rice per month for half a year starting from September; inmates of the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau Detention Center voluntarily saved grain and donated 300 jin of millet.
