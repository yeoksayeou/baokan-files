　　【Baoding Electricity】The Tianjin Prefecture, which suffered severely from floods, has launched a mass production self-salvation movement under the leadership of the Tianjin Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Tianjin Prefectural Administrative Office of the People's Government, and has achieved great results. According to statistics from the end of September, in Wen'an, Wuqing and other counties alone, the number of farmers engaged in fishing and weaving mats reached 90,000, with an average daily income of about 600,000 catties of millet, enough to sustain the lives of 310,000 people. About 60,000 people are engaged in other sideline production, such as willow weaving, cattail weaving, textile, sacks, flour mills, oil pressing, cotton ginning, and transportation and sales, with a daily income of about 400,000 catties of millet, which can sustain the lives of more than 200,000 people. The masses who could not engage in production also devoted themselves to the movement of gathering grass seeds, picking tree leaves, wild vegetables, and collecting firewood. Among the two million disaster victims in the entire prefecture, more than one million are engaged in various production activities that can sustain their lives.
　　The reasons for obtaining the above achievements are mainly: (1) Correctly understand the disaster situation and take the initiative to carry out work. The Tianjin Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party launched the entire party to investigate and survey the disaster situation and the foundation of various sideline handicrafts, correctly analyzed the subjective and objective favorable conditions and difficulties, and after scientific calculation, stipulated the specific tasks of the self-salvation and disaster resistance movement. In the development of the movement, it also promptly corrected the pessimistic and disappointed and blindly optimistic sentiments of some cadres and the masses. (2) A large number of backbone elements have been trained and cultivated in various places, village cadres and old farmers' meetings have been held to implement the education of production self-salvation, explain policies, introduce experiences, conduct democratic discussions, and make scientific plans. In the movement, all localities have also closely grasped the leadership methods of neighborhood representatives and village cadre meetings, promptly studied and solved the problems existing in the movement, and enabled the movement to continue to develop through typical reports and the introduction of experiences. In order to correct the bias of coercion and infringement of the interests of middle peasants, and to establish the idea of ​​unity and mutual assistance in production and self-salvation, Ninghe selected two typical examples for reporting. One was the Renqianhu branch, which promoted party members, led the masses, voluntarily combined, helped each other in production, and overcame the disaster; the other was the Renfengzhuang village cadres, who forced the masses to form large partnerships, infringed on the interests of middle peasants, made extravagant plans, and blindly produced, and failed. Educate cadres and the masses with facts and correct deviations. (3) Widely organize male and female whole and half labor forces to engage in various production activities, and find production outlets in many ways according to different production capacities. In the water town areas, men generally engage in fishing and transportation and sales, while women engage in making reed mats, textiles, weaving mats, etc. Even children are involved in production, twisting hemp ropes, peeling reeds, etc. (4) State-owned economic departments and cooperatives in various places actively carried out business around production and disaster relief, and transported the fish and mats produced by the disaster victims to the cities. The Tianjin Branch of the People's Bank of China has vigorously provided loans to support disaster victims in production. According to incomplete statistics, it has loaned more than 225 million yuan to disaster victims. Shops and cooperatives in various places have adopted the method of supplying raw materials and purchasing finished products to ensure appropriate profits for disaster victims' production.

　　天津专区展开生产自救运动　
    百万灾民得到生活
    【保定电】水灾严重的天津专区，在中共天津地委及人民政府天津专署领导下，掀起群众性的生产自救运动，已获很大的成绩。据九月底统计，仅文安、武清等县，治鱼编席农民即达九万人，每日平均收入小米六十万斤左右，可维持三十一万人的生活，从事其他副业生产的，如柳编、蒲编、纺织、麻袋、粉房、榨油、轧花、运销等，约六万余人，每日可收入小米四十万斤左右，能维持二十余万人的生活。无法生产的群众，也都投入了打草籽、采树叶、野菜、打柴草运动。全专区二百万灾民中，投入各种生产事业能维持生活的达百万余人。
    获得上述成绩的原因，主要为：（一）正确认识灾情，主动进行工作。天津地委曾发动全党调查勘验灾情及各种副业手工业基础，正确分析了主观客观有利条件及困难，经过科学计算，规定了自救抗灾运动的具体任务。并在运动发展中及时纠正了一部分干部及群众的悲观失望与盲目乐观情绪。（二）各地大批训练培养了骨干分子，召开村干、老农会议，贯彻生产自救的教育，讲解政策，介绍经验，民主讨论，科学计划。运动中，各地又紧紧掌握了小区代表、村干会议的领导方法，及时研究解决运动中存在的问题，并通过典型报告、介绍经验，使运动得以持续发展。宁河为了纠正强迫命令与侵犯中农利益的偏向，树立团结互助生产自救的思想，曾选择了两个典型进行报告，一个是任千户支部，推动党员，带动群众，自愿结合，互助生产，战胜了灾荒；一个是任风庄村干部，强迫群众大合伙，侵犯中农利益，计划铺张，盲目生产，遭到失败。以事实教育干部群众，纠正偏向。（三）广泛组织男女整半劳动力，投入各种生产活动，根据不同的生产能力，多方寻找生产出路。水乡区一般是男人治鱼搞运销，妇女打箔、纺织、织席等，连小孩也投入了生产，搓麻绳、剥苇子等。（四）国营经济部门与各地合作社，围绕生产救灾积极开展业务，将灾民生产的鱼、席输往城市。人民银行天津支行，曾大力贷款扶植灾民生产，据不完全统计，已贷给灾民两亿二千五百余万元。各地商店合作社，采用了供给原料收购成品的办法，保证了灾民生产的适当利润。
