　　Tsinghua Establishes Study Group to Promote Language Reform
  [Our Dispatch] Amidst the upsurge of language reform, students at Tsinghua University who volunteer to study the new script have also formed a New Script Study Group. It was initially initiated by Comrade Qiu Guangming, who participated in the Shanghai Language Reform Association, together with some students studying the new script, and will widely solicit student participation. On the 18th, they issued a notice on campus, believing that implementing language reform is an important link in China's cultural construction, and that the Latinized script is the most effective scheme to promote and the most suitable scheme for the needs of the Chinese workers and peasants. They volunteer to study it, research it, and promote it in their spare time. Registration work has now begun. The group plans to hire experts to guide them and will also contact the National Language Reform Association. (Qinghua Communications Group)

　　推动文字改革清华建学习组
  【本报讯】在文字改革的高潮下，清华大学志愿学习新文字的同学也成立了新文字学习组。首先是由参加了上海文字改革协会的裘光明同学联合一部分学习新文字的同学发起，并将广泛的征求同学参加。十八日他们在校内发出通告，认为实行文字改革是中国文化建设上重要的一环，并且拉丁化文字方案是推行得最有效，最能适合中国工农大众需要的一种方案，他们志愿在课外学习它，研究它和推动它。现已开始进行登记工作。该小组准备聘请专人指导，并将与全国的文字改革协会取得联系。　（清华通讯组）
