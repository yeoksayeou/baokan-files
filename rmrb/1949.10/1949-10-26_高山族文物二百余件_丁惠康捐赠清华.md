　　More Than Two Hundred Items of Gaoshan Culture Artifacts
　　Ding Huikang Donates to Tsinghua
　　[North China News] Dr. Ding Huikang, Director of the Hongqiao Sanatorium in Shanghai, is enthusiastic about the study of ethnic minority issues. He once hired specialists to collect artifacts of the Gaoshan people in Taiwan and held exhibitions in Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other places. Recently, Mr. Ding visited Beijing and went to the Tsinghua University Relics Exhibition Room and the Frontier Relics Exhibition Room of the Department of Sociology. He was very willing to support their development and generously donated all of his valuable collection of Gaoshan cultural relics and related books and pictures to the university for research and teaching purposes. Tsinghua University accepted the donation and plans to hold a public exhibition soon. The donated artifacts, totaling more than two hundred pieces, are made of wood, bamboo, pottery, leather, metal, textiles, and shells, including religious objects, food and drink utensils, weapons, clothing, ornaments, sculptures, models, toys, and house ornaments. They not only have extremely beautiful artistic value but are also extremely important materials for anthropology. (Hua Xin Shi)
