　　匈牙利三年计划将提前七个月完成
    【新华社北京十四日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：十二日劳动报刊载匈牙利工会中央委员会主席哈鲁斯蒂亚克一文称：拥有一百六十万会员的匈牙利工会，正在完成着三大任务。第一是按产业原则重建工会组织。第二是在今年年底以前即比预定期限早七个月完成三年计划。第三是同苏联及各人民民主国家工会一起努力加强国际工会运动。
    作者说：在匈牙利的工业命脉如冶金、纺织、化学、采煤及食品等工业和运输业中，工会已按照产业的原则改组了，我们已向前走了一大步。第二项任务正接近完成。匈牙利劳动人民响应了霍夫纳工厂工人的号召，要在十二月十七日完成三年计划，并将在数月内开始奠立社会主义基础的五年计划。匈牙利工人将把匈牙利由一个农业国家变成工业——农业国家。匈牙利工会声言保卫和平，并且与匈牙利工人党一起，力求把匈牙利变成一个以伟大苏联为首的和平阵线中强有力的堡垒。
