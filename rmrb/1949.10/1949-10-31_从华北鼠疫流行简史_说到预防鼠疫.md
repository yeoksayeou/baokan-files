From A Brief History of Plague Epidemics in North China
Talking about Plague Prevention
Yu Yidi, Standing Committee Member of the Beijing Epidemic Prevention Committee, Standing Committee Member of the Beijing Medical Workers Association

As reported, plague has occurred in Chahar Province. The public's reaction to this warning has ranged from indifference to panic. Both extremes are inappropriate. According to the latest intelligence (October 29), of the four deaths in Zhangjiakou, two have been confirmed not to be plague. The other two have not yet been tested. Therefore, whether the plague has truly invaded Zhangjiakou is still questionable. Zhangjiakou is more than 400 li away from this city, and transportation has been cut off, with the army deploying four lines of defense. It can be said that there is no need to panic yet. However, vigilance and preventive measures are absolutely necessary.

Plague is also known as "Bai Sima" or "Black Death," because it is transmitted from rats to fleas, and from fleas to humans, hence the name "rat plague." The main lesion in the lungs is called pneumonic plague. The main lesion in the lymph nodes is called bubonic plague. The two pathogens are the same, and there is no absolute distinction in the symptoms. Because it is transmitted from person to person, the virulence of the bacteria increases after several transmissions. Therefore, the initial stage of the epidemic is often bubonic plague, which later becomes pneumonic plague.

The history of plague epidemics in North China can only be traced back to 1917 (the sixth year of the Republic of China). In November of that year, it spread from the vicinity of Wuyuan to Baotou, in mid-December to Sa County, and in early January of the following year (1918) to Suiyuan. In late January, a cart driver passed through a small village with only a dozen households near Pingdiquan, fell ill, and died four days later. This person infected many people. The villagers fled to nearby villages for refuge, causing all the people in more than a dozen nearby villages to die. Of the more than 400 Catholics who took refuge in the Catholic Church in Pingdiquan, only a few dozen remained. In early March, it spread to Zhangjiakou. Fortunately, the weather warmed up, and the epidemic soon stopped. The old government did not implement any epidemic prevention measures that time, and it died out completely naturally. It did not occur in 1919. After 1919, there were several small outbreaks west of Baotou. It also occurred once in 1929 (the eighteenth year of the Republic of China). The government at the time implemented traffic bans, so it did not invade Baotou City. In early February 1942 (the thirty-first year of the Republic of China), an outbreak occurred in the Wuyuan area, 200 kilometers west of Baotou along the Yellow River in the northern part of the Ordos League, and it even crossed the river and invaded the vicinity of Hequ and Xing County, stopping in mid-May.

The above epidemics were all pneumonic plague that occurred in winter and stopped when the weather warmed up in spring. It can also be called winter plague. The symptoms are a fever of over 40 degrees, hemoptysis, coma within one or two days of onset, and death within two or three days, without exception.

In July 1931 (the twentieth year of the Republic of China), bubonic plague occurred in Yichuan and Ganquan counties south of Yulin, and spread north along the Great Wall to Shenmu, Yulin, Yanchi, and other counties. The epidemic was most severe in August, then gradually weakened and stopped. This outbreak seemed to have been brought from Wuyuan to Yichuan by troop movements. In the following year (1932), there were several small outbreaks in the Great Wall area, but it did not spread.

The period of that epidemic was in summer, and the patients' symptoms were also milder, with a fever of 38 or 39 degrees. The inguinal (thigh) and axillary lymph nodes were red and swollen. Mild cases could still move around and recovered after ten days. Severe cases were comatose and died within four or five days. The mortality rate was low in the early stage of the epidemic, about 40%. Later, it gradually deteriorated, increasing to about 90%.

Pneumonic plague usually occurs in cold winter and stops when it warms up in spring. Its transmission medium is the marmot, which lives on the shores of Lake Baikal in the Soviet Union and in Northeast China, Mongolia, Tibet, and other places. It hibernates every year from October to the warm spring of the following year. Hunters who hunt marmots in winter are often infected. Plague once invaded Beijing at the end of the Guangxu reign, brought by hunters.

Bubonic plague usually starts in summer and stops after autumn cools down. Its transmission medium is wild rats in the mountains. During the transition between spring and autumn, when food is scarce, they come to villages to forage, transmitting the fleas on their bodies to domestic rats. Or they fight and bite domestic rats, transmitting the disease to domestic rats, and then the fleas on domestic rats transmit it to humans. In 1931, a large group of rats moved, passing through the vicinity of Yulin, knocking down many houses in the villages. This was also one of the reasons for the large-scale epidemic in Yulin.

The origin of the current plague epidemic in Chahar Province has not yet been determined. Judging from the season of occurrence and the situation of the epidemic in Bengbeng Village after October 14, it is mostly pneumonic plague.

In the past, plague was a terminal illness. Now, Sulfadiazine is quite effective. The new live bacterial vaccine invented by the Soviet Union is four times more effective than the previous killed bacterial vaccine, but neither treatment nor preventive injection is absolutely safe. The most important thing is to prevent the enemy from invading. Therefore, cutting off traffic, quarantine, isolation, sanitation, and rat catching are the most reliable prevention methods. The government has already done these important things, and some are still in progress. The people of the whole city should mobilize and respond to the government's call for epidemic prevention, so that the hateful and terrible enemy of plague can never invade our capital.

Every citizen should pay close attention to new arrivals or people who have returned from elsewhere in the neighborhood in the past few days. If there is a suspicious sudden illness or rapid death, it must be reported to the police station or epidemic prevention personnel immediately. Do not hesitate, do not delay, and do not ignore it. Secondly, follow the instructions of the Epidemic Prevention Committee and vigorously implement sanitation and rat catching.

Medical workers, when seeing patients in clinics or on house calls, if you find a suspected plague patient, you must immediately call the Epidemic Prevention Section of the Health Bureau (2nd Bureau 1098). At the same time, report to the police station. Do not allow the patient to move. After the Health Bureau takes the patient to the hospital, strictly disinfect the places he has walked and the things he has touched. Burn what can be burned, and do not be afraid of offending the patient or affecting business. Know that isolating a patient is equivalent to saving thousands of compatriots!

Finally, hidden reactionaries may take the opportunity to spread rumors and shake people's hearts. Newspapers and radio stations will regularly report on the epidemic. Only the news released by the Epidemic Prevention Committee is correct. The current government is the people's government, and the Epidemic Prevention Committee is jointly formed by government agencies and people's organizations. It will not exaggerate facts, nor will it conceal facts. The enemy is still far away. Everyone should be calm and composed, but must not be paralyzed. We must have a high degree of vigilance and take all necessary preventive measures to protect the safety of the people of the capital.

　　从华北鼠疫流行简史　
    说到预防鼠疫
    北京防疫委员会常委北京医务工作者协会常委  余贻倜
    察北发生鼠疫，已如报载。市民对于这个警报的反应，有的表现麻木不仁，有的则是惊惶失措。这两种偏向都是不适当的。据最近（二十九日）的情报，张家口死者四人中，两人已经证明不是鼠疫。其他两人还没有检验完毕。所以鼠疫是否真正侵入张家口市，还是疑问。张家口距本市还有四百多里，其间已经断绝交通，并且有军队布置四道防线，可以说还没有惊慌的必要。但是警惕和预防的措施却是绝对必要的。
    鼠疫一名白斯马，又名黑死病，因为是由老鼠传染给跳蚤、跳蚤传染给人，所以叫鼠疫。主要病变在肺的叫肺鼠疫。主要病变在淋巴腺的叫腺鼠疫。两种病源相同，疫候也没有绝对的区别。因为由人传染人，经过几次传染后，病菌的毒力增强，所以往往流行初期是腺鼠疫，后来就成肺鼠疫了。
    华北鼠疫流行的历史只能回溯到一九一七（民国六）年，是年十一月由五原附近蔓延到包头，十二月中旬到萨县，次年（一九一八）一月上旬到绥远。一月下旬，有一个人赶大车经过平地泉附近一个只有十几家人的小村庄，发病四天死亡。这个人传染了很多人。该处村民逃往附近村庄避难，因此附近十几个村庄全死光了。在平地泉天主教堂避难的四百多教徒，只剩了几十个人。三月上旬，流行到张家口，幸好天气变暖，不久就停止流行了，那一次旧政府没有施行任何防疫措置，完全是自然熄灭的。一九一九年没有发生。一九一九年以后，包头西方曾有数度小流行。一九二九（民国十八）年又发生过一次。当时的政府施行断绝交通，所以没有侵入包头市。一九四二（民国三十一）年二月初，伊克昭盟北部黄河沿岸包头西二百公里五原地区发生过一次，并曾渡河侵入河曲兴县附近，至五月中旬停止流行。
    以上几次流行，都是在冬季发生的肺鼠疫，春季变暖时停止，也可以名曰冬季鼠疫，症候是发烧四十度以上，咯血痰，发病后一两天就昏迷不省，两三天内死亡，绝无幸免。
    一九三一（民国二十）年七月，榆林南方的宜川、甘泉县境发生腺鼠疫，沿长城北上，蔓延到神木，榆林，盐池等县境。八月疫势最盛，以后渐渐减弱而停止。这次流行好象是因军队移动，由五原带到宜川的，次年（一九三二）长城一带有数处小流行，未至蔓延。
    那次流行的时期是在夏季，病人症候也轻些，发烧三十八、九度。鼠蹊（大腿窝）及腋下淋巴腺红肿，轻的还能够行动，十几天功夫好了。重的昏迷不醒，四五天内死亡。流行初期死亡率低，约百分之四十。以后渐渐恶化，增到百分之九十左右。
    肺鼠疫普通在冬季寒冷时发生，春季温暖时停止。它的传染媒介是旱獭，这种动物住在苏联贝加尔湖畔和我国东北、蒙古、西藏等地。它每年从十月开始冬眠到次年春暖。猎人在冬天猎获旱獭，往往被传染。光绪末年，鼠疫曾一度侵入北京，就是猎人带来的。
    腺鼠疫多在夏季开始，秋凉后停止。它的传染媒介是山上的野鼠，春秋之交，食粮青黄不接的时候，它们来村落觅食，把它身上的跳蚤传给家鼠。或与家鼠争斗咬伤，把病传给家鼠，由家鼠身上的跳蚤再传染给人。一九三一年曾有大群耗子搬家，经过榆林附近，把村庄的房屋都掘倒了很多，这也是鼠疫在榆林大流行的原因之一。
    这次察北鼠疫流行的发源地尚未判明。由发生的季节和十月十四日以后崩崩村流行的情况推测，多半是肺鼠疫。
    从前鼠疫是绝症，现在有Ｓｕｌδａｄｉｒｚｉｎ，相当有效。苏联新发明的活菌疫苗，比从前的死菌疫苗效力大四倍，但无论治疗或注射预防都不是绝对保险的。最重要的是不准敌人侵入，所以断绝交通、检疫、隔离、清洁、捕鼠才是最可靠的预防法。这几件重要的事情，政府都已经办了，有的正在办。全市人民都应该动员起来，响应政府防疫的号召，使鼠疫这个可恶可怕的敌人永远不能侵袭我们的首都。
    每个市民要严密注意邻居街坊新来的、或从别处最近几天内回来的人。若有可疑的突然患病或迅速的死亡，要火速报告派出所或防疫人员。切勿犹豫，迟疑，切勿漠视不管。其次是服从防疫委员会的指示，厉行清洁捕鼠。
    医务工作者们，在门诊或出诊时，如果发现疑似鼠疫病人，要一刻不容缓地打电话给卫生局防疫科（二局一○九八）。同时报告派出所。不许病人移动，候卫生局把病人接入医院后，再将他走过的地方，沾过的东西严密消毒。能烧的烧掉，不要怕得罪病人影响营业。要知你隔离住一个病人，就等于救活千百个同胞！
    最后，潜伏的反动分子，可能乘机造谣，动摇人心，报纸和电台经常会有疫情报告。只有防疫委员会发布的消息是正确的，现在的政府是人民的，而且这防疫委员会是政府各机关与人民团体合组的，它不肯夸大事实，也不会隐蔽事实，敌人还很远，大家要镇静沉着，但决不能麻痹，要有高度的警惕性，采取一切必要的预防措施，保护首都人民的安全。
