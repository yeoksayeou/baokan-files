　　Kalmanov Says: Dance Must Serve the People, Promote Peace, and Express Truth
    [Report from this newspaper] The All-China Dance Association and the Soviet Cultural Delegation's dance artists held a joint symposium yesterday (the 10th) at 3:00 PM at the European and American Students Association. Attendees included Kalmanov, leader of the song and dance group of the Soviet Cultural Delegation, Soviet Honorary Artists Sergeyev and Dukinskaya, dancers from the Leningrad Song and Dance Ensemble, and Korenkov, a member of the Red Army Song and Dance Ensemble, as well as representatives from the All-China Dance Association, the Beijing Student Dance Federation, the China Youth Theater Dance Team and Children's Team, the Huabei University Dance Team, the Huabei University Arts and Crafts First and Third Regiments, the People's Art Troupe Dance Group, the Inner Mongolia Art Troupe, and ethnic minority dancers, school dance workers, totaling over thirty people. The meeting began with a welcoming speech by Dai Ailian, Chairman of the All-China Dance Association, followed by a response from Kalmanov, leader of the Soviet delegation, who pointed out that as long as dance adheres to the principle of serving the people, it will not go wrong. Then, Sergeyev, a dancer who has won the Stalin Prize three times, responded on behalf of the delegation to the questions raised by the Dance Association regarding "how Soviet dance integrates with reality," "the situation and development of dance during the Great Revolution," and "how dance integrates with Stanislavski's acting method." He said: "Soviet art bears a great task, art can promote peace and express truth. Art is also clearly divided into two camps, one representing light and the other representing darkness, and I believe China represents light. China is an ancient nation, but today we see a young China. Before the revolution, Soviet classical dance was only enjoyed by a small number of nobles, but now it is enjoyed by the broad masses of the people and serves the broad masses of the people. Before the revolution, the content of dance was mythology and fantasy, and the dance and expression were separate, the movements were all fake and unrealistic. Stanislavski's method mainly makes the dance consistent with the expression. Today, young workers and peasants go on stage to perform instead of ancient dramas. This is not a complete abandonment of heritage and past scripts. The audience still has a great interest in old scripts. Today, new characters are required to go on stage. The scripts of Soviet theaters mostly use the works of world-renowned writers such as Pushkin and Byron, and are performed in a realistic way in the ballet theater. Dance is no longer just an entertainment for a few people in the past, but an educational product, educating the spirit of communism. Some classical dances have emerged on stage about the history of the struggle for human happiness, such as 'The Flames of Paris,' a ballet that shows the French people's struggle for freedom, as well as some about the struggle life of Soviet guerrillas during the civil war, the situation of the Spanish people fighting against darkness, etc., which all show that the abstract dance of the past has now become very profound, concrete and meaningful." He pointed out that the road of Soviet dance today is correct, that is, to express the people who are moving forward, that is, the people who are building a communist society, which is the combination of classical dance and socialist reality. And Western dance is bankrupt and harmful to mankind. He said that China's art today represents truth and peace, and hopes that Chinese art will have great achievements in the future. Korenkov, a member of the Red Army Song and Dance Ensemble, went on to explain that the Red Army Song and Dance Ensemble originated from folk songs and dances. Twenty years ago, there were only twelve soldiers, of whom only two danced. Now it has developed to three hundred people, with fifty dancers, seventy musicians, and one hundred and eight singers. These are constantly joined by amateur dancers from the troops. He also narrated the activities of the Song and Dance Ensemble in the Red Army. Female Honorary Dancer Dukinskaya also expressed many opinions on recording dance. During the tea break, the All-China Dance Association presented these Soviet art dancers with a copy of the Huabei University Dance Team's dance film and many boxes of Beijing local small masks, and presented flowers to these people's art dancers for a joint photo. Finally, the meeting ended with enthusiastic cheers of "Long live Sino-Soviet friendship" and "Long live Mao Zedong and Stalin."

　　加尔曼诺夫说：舞蹈要为人民服务促进和平表现真理
    【本报讯】中华人民共和国全国舞协与苏联文化代表团舞蹈艺术家联合座谈会，昨（十日）下午三时在欧美同学会举行，到会者有苏联文化代表团歌舞组组长加尔曼诺夫，苏联荣誉艺术家列宁格勒歌舞院舞蹈家谢尔基也夫及杜金斯卡娅，红军歌舞团团员柯任柯夫等三人，全国舞协、北京学生舞联、中国青年剧院舞蹈队和少年儿童队、华大舞蹈队、华大文工第一、第三团、人民文工团舞蹈组、内蒙文工团等代表暨少数民族舞蹈家，学校舞蹈工作者三十余人。首由全国舞协主任委员戴爱莲主席致欢迎词，苏联代表团舞蹈组长加尔曼诺夫致答词，指出舞蹈一定要把握着为人民服务的原则，就不会错误。接着由荣获三次斯大林奖金的舞蹈家谢尔基也夫代表答复舞协所提关于“苏联舞蹈如何与现实结合”“大革命时舞蹈情形和怎样发展的”“舞蹈如何与斯丹尼斯拉夫的表演方法结合”等问题。他说：“苏联艺术负着伟大任务，艺术可以促进和平表现真理。艺术很明显的也分成两个阵营，一部分代表光明，一部分代表黑暗，我相信中国是代表光明的。中国是古老的民族，但今天我们看到一个青年的中国。苏联的古典舞革命前仅为少数贵族享受，而现在是为广大人民享受并且为广大人民服务。革命以前舞蹈的内容是神话和空想，跳舞和表情是分开的，动作都是假的不现实。斯丹尼斯拉夫的方法，主要使舞蹈与表情一致。现在青年的工人农民上舞台表演代替了古代的戏剧，这并不是完全放弃了遗产和过去的剧本，观众对旧剧本的兴趣还很大，今天是要求新的人物到舞台上去。苏联剧院的脚本大都是利用世界著名文豪普希金、拜伦等的作品，用现实的方法在舞剧院中表演出来。舞蹈已不是象过去光为少数人的娱乐品，而是一种教育品，教育共产主义的精神。已有一些古典舞是为人类幸福而斗争的历史在舞台出现，如“巴黎的火焰”是表明法国人民为自由而奋斗的舞剧，还有一些关于苏联游击队内战时的斗争生活，表现西班牙人民与黑暗奋斗情形的等等，这都说明过去抽象的舞蹈，今日已变成很深刻具体而有内容的了。”他指出苏联舞蹈今天的道路是正确的，就是要表现出前进的人，即建设共产主义社会的人，这就是古典舞与社会主义现实的结合。而西方的舞蹈是破产的，有害人类的。他说中国今天的艺术代表真理与和平，希望中国艺术将来有很大的成就。红军歌舞团员柯任柯夫接着又说明了红军歌舞团是由民间歌舞产生的，二十年前，最初只十二个士兵，其中仅仅两个跳舞的，现在已发展到三百人，有五十个跳舞的七十个弹音乐的，一百零八个会唱的，这些都是由部队中业余的舞蹈家们不断加入的，他又叙述了歌舞团红军中的活动。女荣誉舞蹈家杜金斯卡娅亦对记录舞蹈发表了许多意见。在茶点时间全国舞协并赠送这些苏联艺术舞蹈家，华大舞蹈队舞蹈影片一册及北京土产小面具多盒，并献花与这些人民艺术舞蹈家联合拍照，最后始在“中苏友好万岁”，“毛泽东斯大林万岁”的热烈欢呼中散会。
