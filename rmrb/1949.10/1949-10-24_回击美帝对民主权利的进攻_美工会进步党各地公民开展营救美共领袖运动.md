Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 23rd (TASS, New York, October 22nd dispatch): The movement to rescue Communist leaders continues to grow in the United States. Responsible personnel from many national, regional, and local unions held an emergency meeting in New York and formed a Union Committee to fight for the rescue of Communist leaders. The meeting passed a statement saying that if this verdict is not immediately changed by mass protests from the American people, reactionaries will attack the basic rights of all union workers. The meeting urged all union workers to write to Truman and U.S. Attorney General McGrath, demanding that Communist leaders and their defense lawyers be allowed reasonable bail pending the defendants' appeal to higher courts against Medina's verdict. The meeting guaranteed to raise funds to aid the struggle to rescue Communist leaders.

The Workers Daily reported from Philadelphia that the local branch of the Progressive Party sent letters to Truman and McGrath, demanding that Communist leaders be allowed to post reasonable bail for release pending the defendants' appeal against the verdict to a higher court.

In Boston, fourteen prominent educators and pastors protested this "trial," believing it was an attack on democratic rights.

In Madison, Wisconsin, citizens including University of Wisconsin professor William Rice wrote to McGrath stating: "Attacks on Communists endanger the freedom of the American people."

　　回击美帝对民主权利的进攻
    美工会进步党各地公民开展营救美共领袖运动
    【新华社北京二十三日电】塔斯社纽约二十二日讯：营救共产党领袖的运动在美国继续增长，许多全国性、区域性与地方性工会的负责人员在纽约举行非常会议，并成立为营救共产党领袖而战的工会委员会。会议通过声明称，如果不以美国人民的群众性抗议立即改变这一判决，则反动派将进攻一切工会工作者的基本权利。会议敦促一切工会工作者致函杜鲁门与美国司法部长麦格拉斯，要求允许交合理的保金保释共产党领袖和他们的辩护律师，以待被告就麦迪纳的判决向更高的法庭提出上诉。会议保证筹集资金，以援助营救共产党领袖的斗争。
    工人日报自费城报道，进步党地方党部致函杜鲁门与麦格拉斯，要求允许共产党领袖交纳合理的保金保释出狱，以待被告就判决向更高的法庭提出上诉。
    在波士顿，十四名著名的教育家与牧师抗议这一“审判”认为这是对民主权利的进攻。
    在威斯康星州麦迪逊城，威斯康星州大学教授威廉·莱斯等公民们致函麦格拉斯称：“对共产党人的进攻，危及美国人民的自由。”
