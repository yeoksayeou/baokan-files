A Country That Does Not Become a Country
By Kasa Kin, translated by Zhang Xinmai

　　It is 150 kilometers by train from The Hague to Brussels, and a bit further from Brussels to Luxembourg. You can board the train early in the morning at the small but well-equipped Hague station, have lunch in Brussels, and arrive in Luxembourg the same evening, whether by train or car.

　　Though the journey is short, the scenery changes greatly along the way. The Gothic architecture of the old Belgian cities replaces the traditional Dutch windmills, and the forested slopes of the Ardennes Mountains replace the Dutch canals and dikes, scene after scene unfolding before your eyes.

　　In one day, you pass through three capitals: the tranquil and bureaucratic The Hague, the bustling and noisy Brussels, and the neat and verdant Luxembourg with its ancient fortress. In one day, you enter three different countries: the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, each with its own culture and history.

　　Yet these three countries are collectively referred to as "Benelux." Newspapers constantly shove this three-syllable word, newly added to Western European political vocabulary, down the throats of readers in Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. Like the advertisements for certain American registered medicines, Benelux appears frequently in Western European newspapers. The Americanized press touts it as a panacea for all political and economic ills in Western Europe. They avoid using the individual names of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, replacing them with the mysterious "Benelux." Headlines constantly scream things like "Benelux Ministers Meet in The Hague," "Benelux Representatives Invited to London," "Benelux Supports the Atlantic Pact," giving readers the impression that the three countries along the Scheldt, Meuse, and Alzette rivers no longer exist, replaced by the new country of "Benelux." However, no matter how diligently you search the Belgian plains, the Dutch lowlands, and the Luxembourg forests, you will not find the country of "Benelux." The conclusion is: it only exists in the Americanized press.

　　"Benelux" is a non-existent country, and its inglorious history has become a strange interlude in the political life of Western Europe today.

　　　　　　※　　　　　　　　　※　　　　　　　※

　　The origins of "Benelux" can be traced back to 1944. At that time, the governments of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg were located only a few hundred miles apart, just a couple of streets away in London. It was while these three exiled governments were directly receiving support from British and American diplomats and military officers that the overall design to combine these three small countries into one began, named "Benelux," composed of the first syllable of each country's name. (Netherlands is also called Nederland – translator's note.)

　　The initiators of this plan painted intoxicating prospects. They said that the Netherlands is an agricultural country needing a market for its agricultural products and for the import of metal goods. On the other hand, Belgium and Luxembourg need Dutch dairy products and vegetables, and also need a market for metal goods. Thus, these three countries could become a coordinated economic unit by eliminating tariff barriers and engaging in free trade. At the same time, this could provide a "bold example" for other Western European countries to organize economic cooperation and eliminate the tariff barriers that American merchants find so "annoying." The ambitious politicians of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg were also confident that they could truly see "Benelux" become an "important political force" on the European continent.

　　On September 5, 1944, the Three-Country Customs Conference closed in London. Adjustments to tax rates were followed by revisions to customs legislation, finally leading to the joint elimination of tariff barriers. Subsequently, there were plans to eliminate currency controls and foreign trade quotas, and even proposals to establish some kind of mechanism to unify the three countries' foreign policies.

　　All these policies and plans met with a sad fate when they began to be implemented. Some economic measures were shelved in the various councils, committees, and subcommittees established to implement the London resolutions. Only a little progress was made in the political sphere: a customs union executive office was established in Brussels; several organizations were also set up to unify the activities of reactionary political parties and organizations. Last April, an agreement was established between the three countries' Catholic parties, followed by the establishment of ties between the three countries' Catholic trade unions in May.

　　Internationally, the governments of these three countries also "adjusted." Their British and American patrons simply regarded the three countries' governments as a single political bloc: for example, the three countries joined the Western European Union as a single unit, the three countries were invited to London as a whole to discuss the German question, and the three countries jointly obtained a portion of land bordering West Germany, and so on.

　　However, on the other hand, the economy was regressing. This, of course, had deep-rooted reasons.

　　　　　　　　　　※　　　　　　　　　※　　　　　　※

　　Even in the first year or two after the war, travelers in Belgium and the Netherlands could not fail to notice the differences in the economic situations of the two countries. In the cities of Belgium, he could see prosperous streets and shops filled with food and goods. In the Netherlands, however, he could only see queues for purchasing rationed goods and insufficient food rations.

　　Belgium did not suffer any major losses during the war. Its industry was constantly busy working to supply the Nazi invaders, and Belgian industrial capitalists were very happy to cooperate with the Nazis. Leading monopolies such as General Company, Pynaert, Empain, and Solvay made as much money as they had before the war. In 1943, the profits of Belgian capitalists amounted to 2.3 billion francs. Economic losses were also small when the German army withdrew. The major seaport of Antwerp was liberated by Belgian guerrillas, many of whom were Soviet prisoners of war, before the British army arrived, remaining intact and undamaged.

　　After the war, Antwerp became the main supply port for British and American troops in Europe, which was of great economic significance to Belgium. In the last year of the war, Belgian merchants acted as agents for British and American troops. The business of managing, transshipping, and storing supplies earned more than ten billion.

　　Unlike other Western European countries, Belgium's gold reserves increased more at the end of the war than before. Britain, France, and the Netherlands borrowed from her, amounting to $228 million. After the war, the demand for metal products increased greatly, and Belgium's metal industry and Luxembourg's steel industry benefited greatly from this, with the former having recovered to the production level of 1929.

　　The situation in the Netherlands was very different. The wartime losses were greater, and at the same time, it lost its market in Germany. The once-powerful merchant fleet was sharply reduced in tonnage, and the colonial war in Indonesia made the situation even worse. Last year, military spending accounted for 18 percent of the total national budget, compared with only 5.3 percent in 1938. Agricultural products also could not find a market.

　　The disparity in economic situations greatly affected economic cooperation between the three countries.

　　Dutch merchants, fearing that domestic products could not compete with cheap Belgian goods—which was certainly not without reason—were the first to oppose the proposal to reduce tariffs, and Belgian industrialists retaliated by opposing the abolition of tariff restrictions on Dutch goods.

　　As late as 1947, you could still see a very meaningful poster on the streets of Brussels: "Benelux is good; but please save Belgian beer!"

　　Here, it is necessary to say something about the conflict of industrial interests between Belgium and the Netherlands. The Dutch brewing industry produces a large amount of high-quality beer, which is sold in Belgium at a lower price than Belgian domestic products. Thus, the plan to abolish import duties on Dutch beer naturally aroused strong protests from the Belgian brewing industry. Last January, Benelux economic negotiations failed to reach an agreement on the issue of unified beer tax rates. The tax rates on other alcoholic beverages, white sugar, and fuel were also not decided. Since the tariff issues for these commodities could not be resolved, there was certainly no question of reaching any understanding on the issue of abolishing tariff restrictions on large-scale production of agricultural and industrial products.

　　Take the wonderful plan for the sale of Dutch vegetables and fruits to Belgium. As in previous years, these agricultural products account for a large proportion of trade between the two countries. However, Belgian merchants were unwilling to let Dutch exporters monopolize the Belgian food market, and the Flemish farmers' organization in Belgium has been fiercely resisting Dutch competition.

　　The plan for the Netherlands to obtain its entire steel supply from Belgium has also not been implemented. Dutch steel companies are somewhat jealous of Belgium and are trying to increase steel production in Ijmuiden, which has greatly dissatisfied Belgium. The Dutch textile industry, in order to protect itself, has come out against the large-scale import of Belgian textiles. Things are continuing like this.

　　Financial cooperation between the Netherlands and Belgium is also a gloomy picture. The official exchange rate between the Dutch guilder and the Belgian franc is one to sixteen. However, according to the black market price, the Dutch guilder can only be exchanged for eight francs, sensitively reflecting the weakness of the Dutch currency. If tariff barriers are removed, an exchange rate of one to eight will become popular, which is obviously unfavorable to Dutch merchants.

　　Neither Dutch nor Belgian merchants are willing to sacrifice their own interests for the sake of "Benelux."

　　The debate between the shipping industries of Antwerp and Rotterdam is particularly characteristic. When the issue of adjusting the roles of the two major seaports was raised, Belgian merchants immediately and vehemently opposed the abolition of any existing privileges of Antwerp. At a meeting of the Antwerp Chamber of Commerce, the chairman, Frédéric Astrid, announced:

　　"We fully understand the meaning of 'Benelux' and are willing to sacrifice for it. However, there is a limit to our sacrifices. The day will come when we have to consider whether 'Benelux' still has any value."

　　In this situation, it is not surprising that the many meetings held repeatedly between the governments of the three countries in the past two years have not achieved any results. This March, the "Benelux" ministers met again in The Hague. The only gain from this expanded meeting was to extend the economic union to July 1, 1950, and to decide that July 1 of this year would be the date for unified tariffs, but according to newspaper reports, this decision is unlikely to be implemented.

　　　　　　　　　※　　　　　　　　　※　　　　　　　※

　　From this, it can be seen that although the ideal of merging the three Benelux countries into one has been solemnly announced for five years, there has been no progress in its implementation. The passage of time has gradually clarified the motives of those politicians who announced the establishment of "Benelux" in London in 1944. The three countries of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg are different, and there are sharp economic conflicts, but they have one thing in common: the penetration of American capital and the unprecedented strength of American monopoly capital.

　　In Dutch cities, you can soon encounter a strange person: a young man wearing clothes sewn with the American flag. This is the public symbol of the Marshall Plan, and the three countries in the Benelux group are currently tasting the bitter fruits of the Marshall Plan.

　　Belgium is a very typical example. This highly developed industrial country has retreated from being a manufacturer of industrial products in Europe to being a market for American goods. It imports cigarettes, shoes, clothing, stockings, and, of course, chewing gum from the United States. At the same time, American goods are squeezing Belgian goods out of the markets of France, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. Metal products, which are one of Belgium's main exports, still only account for 45 percent of pre-war exports. Coal and coke are also encountering market difficulties, while large quantities of low-quality coal with an ash content of up to 50 percent are being imported from the United States.

　　Under the guidance of American officials, loans in the Marshall Plan are being used for strategic construction work—expanding military port facilities, building airports, and repairing railways and highways. The Industrial Loan Company under the National Bank of Belgium cannot independently decide the use of loans; two American "advisors" supervise the allocation. The fact that 300,000 people are unemployed in a country of eight million people is the best illustration of the current state of Belgian industry.

　　In the Netherlands, the results of Marshallization are even worse, especially for agriculture, which has been deprived of its market. Vegetables cannot be imported into West Germany, and millions of tons of sweet potatoes, cucumbers, and tomatoes are rotting in storage. In 1945 and 1946, Britain stopped importing Dutch vegetables during the vegetable harvest season, and Dutch vegetable merchants had to lower prices and sell at a loss.

　　American monopoly capital is hindering the development of the Dutch shipbuilding industry and is telling the Dutch to buy old American ships. The United States refuses to supply Dutch shipyards with high-grade steel and shipbuilding equipment; the machinery and equipment allocated to the Netherlands account for only 5 percent of the total amount of materials obtained by the Netherlands in the Marshall Plan.

　　On the other hand, some American companies are investing heavily in the Netherlands to build new factories: Kaiser-Frazer automobiles are located in Rotterdam, and its equipment belongs to the Chicago Crane Company and the Dutch-American Tire Company (a subsidiary of Goodyear Rubber Company). The newly established Dutch-American traffic signal equipment factory has also been invested in by the American General Railway Signal Company. The American Rheem Manufacturing Company has also established a Dutch subsidiary specializing in the manufacture of packaging materials for the chemical and oil industries.

　　American merchants want to use the non-existent country of "Benelux" to seize control of the economies of the three small countries. While the capitalists of Belgium and the Netherlands are quarreling, American monopoly capital is taking full advantage of this opportunity. For example, the British and American authorities in West Germany are shipping goods from Bremen and Hamburg into Germany when friction occurs between Antwerp and Rotterdam. In order to prevent the Netherlands and Belgium from exchanging vegetables and steel as they please, American monopoly capitalists are presenting a cold reality to the people of the two countries: the Netherlands buys American metal products, and Belgium buys American dried vegetables. In the final analysis, the only beneficiary of the removal of tariff barriers is American exporters. The reason why they are always clamoring for the removal of tariff systems and other obstacles is to economically invade Western European countries without hindrance.

　　American politicians are also conducting an activity that is very important to them: turning these three countries into bridgeheads for aggression. Belgian and Dutch staff officers regularly consult on military matters under the guidance of Britain and America. Dutch officers visit Belgian barracks and inspect Belgian army exercises; Belgian military representatives are also invited to the Netherlands. These activities are all directed by Britain and America. Marshal Montgomery, Chairman of the Supreme Command of the Western European Union, frequently visits Brussels and The Hague.

　　Militaristic propaganda is rampant. Belgian cities are plastered with posters of fully armed young soldiers, encouraging Belgians: "Find a career in the army!" The footnote kindly tells you: "For details, please inquire at the Prince Baudouin Barracks in Dejli, Brussels." Luxembourg, which had only a company of troops before the war, is also greatly expanding its "army."

　　A progressive newspaper in Belgium recently published a cartoon: a large ship labeled "Benelux Marshall Plan" is crushing two haggard workers—one Dutch, one Belgian—while a delighted American merchant watches from the sidelines.

　　The Benelux plan has not brought any benefits to the people of the three countries. For a long time, they were deceived by lies about the happy prospects of "economic cooperation." Under the smokescreen of economic cooperation negotiations, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg were lured into an aggressive bloc. Now, the facts have exposed the trick, and the people of the three countries are beginning to realize that everything in the past was just a large-scale political scam, the purpose of which was to economically and politically enslave the three countries and make them the operational outposts and aggressive bases of the Western European bloc.

　　The diplomats of America and Britain want to use "Benelux," a country that does not become a country, as a counter for playing political conspiracies, but the people of the three countries will not be used by this conspiracy. An old worker in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, said to me one day:

　　"This 'Benelux' thing reminds me of a scene where a group of puppies are fighting, and their common owner is pulling hard in front. In this situation, we will never find happiness."

　　一个不成为国家的国家
    卡萨金作  张心迈译
    从海牙坐火车到布鲁塞尔有一百五十公里，从布鲁塞尔到卢森堡比较远一点。一大早在小而设备周全的海牙车站上车，吃午点时便可抵布鲁塞尔，当天晚上，不论是坐火车或者是坐汽车，都可以到达卢森堡。
    虽然路程不远，沿途景物却变化得很大。古老的比国城市中哥德式的建筑线，代替了荷兰传统的风车，阿登山脉的林坡代替了荷兰的运河和堤闸，一幕幕映入眼帘。
    一天中经过三个都城：沉静的官僚的海牙，繁华而嘈杂的布鲁塞尔，整洁青翠的卢森堡及其古老的梭堡。一天中进入了三个不同的国家：荷兰，比利时，卢森堡，各有其自身的文化与历史的三个国家。
    然而这三个国家却被统称为“比尼卢”。报纸不断地把这个新近增入西欧政治用语中的三联字，硬塞入比、荷、卢三国读者的喉咙。象某些美国注册药品的广告一样，比尼卢经常在西欧报纸上出现。美国化的报纸把它捧成为一种医治西欧政治上经济上的所有疾病的万灵膏。他们避免用比利时，荷兰，卢森堡等单字而代之以神秘的“比尼卢”；头条新闻上老是些“比尼卢部长会于海牙”“比尼卢代表应邀赴伦敦”“比尼卢拥护大西洋公约”等尖声怪叫，给读者一个感觉：分别沿着雪耳德河，买士河，亚查德河的三个国家不复存在，代之而起的是“比尼卢”这个新国家。然而，不论你怎样勤快地到比利时平原，荷兰洼地以及卢森堡的森林中去寻找，你总找不出“比尼卢”这个国家来。结论是：只有美国化的报纸上才有它。
    “比尼卢”是一个并不存在的国家，它不光荣的历史成了今日西欧政治生活中一段神奇的插话。
    　　　　　　※　　　　　　　　　※　　　　　　　※
    “比尼卢”的开始当追溯到一九四四年。当时荷、比、卢三国政府的所在地离不了几百里远，只不过在伦敦隔两三条街。就在这三个流亡政府直接接受英美外交官及军官支持的时候，并三小国为一，国与国间的整体的设计便开端了，名叫“比尼卢”，乃由三国国名之第一个音节所组成。（荷兰亦称尼德兰——译注。）
    这个计划的首倡者画出了令人陶醉的远景。他们说，荷兰是一个农业国家，需要一个农产品市场和输入金属品；另一方面，比利时和卢森堡需要荷兰的奶品和蔬菜，同时又需要一个金属品市场，这样，这三个国家便可以用取消关税堡垒，进行自由贸易的方法变成一个协调的经济单位。同时，这样做也可以给西欧其他各国组织经济合作及取消美国商人所感到非常“讨厌”的关税壁垒一个“大胆的创例”。比、荷、卢三国野心勃勃的政客们也满以为真正能够看到“比尼卢”成为欧洲大陆上一个“重要的政治力量”。
    一九四四年九月五日，三国关税会议闭会于伦敦。调整税率之后继之以关税立法之修正而终于共同取消关税壁垒。此后又曾计划取消货币管制及对外贸易配额等等，甚至还有成立某种机构统一三国外交政策的提议。
    所有这些方策和计划一开始实用时便遭遇到可悲的命运。一些经济措施都在为执行伦敦决议而设立的各种理事会，委员会以及分会都浅搁下来。仅政治方面还有点进展：布鲁塞尔成立了关税联盟执行处；统一反动政党与反动组织活动的机关也设置了好几个。去年四月三国天主教政党成立协定，接着五月间三国天主教职工联盟也建立了联系。
    在国际上，这三个国家底政府也“调整起来了”。它们底英美的后台老闾仅仅把三个国家的政府当作一个政治集团看待：如三国以一个单位的名义加入西欧联盟，三国以一个整体被邀赴伦敦讨论德国问题，三国共同获得西德边境的一部分土地等等。
    可是，另一方面，经济方面却在开倒车。这当然是有根深蒂固的原因的。
    　　　　　　　　　　※　　　　　　　　　※　　　　　　※
    即令是在战后头一两年中间，比利时，荷兰的旅客也决不会看不出两国经济情况的差异来。在比利时的城市中，他可以看到繁华的街道和摆满了食品和货物的商店。在荷兰，他却只能看到购买配给品的行列和不敷的配粮。
    比利时在战时并未受到任何大的损失。她的工业始终在为供应纳粹侵略者而忙于工作，比国大工业资本家也非常乐意跟纳粹合作。通用公司，丕纳勋莱、安本，索尔未等占领导地位的垄断资本跟战前一样大赚其钱。一九四三年，比国资本家的利润达廿三亿法郎之多。德军撤退时，经济上的损失也很小。大海港安特渥普在英军到达前即已由有很多苏联战俘参加的比国游击队解放，保持了完整无损。
    战后，安特渥普成为欧陆英美军队的主要供应港口，这对比利时有很重要的经济意义。大战最后一年中，比商为英美军队代办管理。转运以及贮藏供应品的业务赚了十多亿。
    不象西欧其他各国，比利时的黄金准备，在战争末期反比以前增多。英国、法国荷兰都向她借款，数达二亿二千八百万美元。战后金属品需要大增，比利时的金属工业及卢森堡的钢铁工业都因此获益不小，前者已恢复到一九二九年的生产水平。
    荷兰的情形可大不相同。战时损失既比较大，同时又失掉了在德国的市场，强大一时的商船，吨数锐减，印尼殖民战争，更把局势搞得越来越糟。去年军费占去了全部国家预算的百分之十八，而一九三八年却不过百分之五点三，农产品也找不到市场。
    经济情况的悬殊大大地影响了三国间的经济合作。
    荷兰商人恐怕国产品竞争不过价廉的比国货——这当然不是没有原因的——首先起而反对减低关税的提议，比利时工业家也以反对废除对荷兰商品的关税限制来报复。
    一直到一九四七年，你还可以在布鲁塞尔大街上看到一张意义非常明显的招贴：“比尼卢好是好；但是，请救一救比利时的啤酒吧！”
    这里必须说一段关于比荷两国工业利益冲突的插话。荷兰酿造业出产大量高级啤酒，运至比利时出售，价格比比国土产还要低。这样，废除荷兰啤酒进口税的计划当然引起了比国酿酒业激烈的抗议。去年正月比尼卢经济谈判对统一啤酒税率问题未能获得协议。其他酒精酿制品，白糖，燃料的税率也一样没有成立决定。这种商品的关税问题既然都解决不了，关于取消大规模生产的农产品与工业品的关税限制的问题当然更谈不上会成立什么谅解了。
    拿荷兰蔬菜水果南销比利时的美妙的计划来说吧。正如往年一样，这些农产品在两国贸易中占有很大的比例。但比利时商人却不愿意让荷兰出口商独占比国的食品市场，比国法兰德斯族的农民组织对荷兰的竞争一直在激烈反抗。
    荷兰由比利时获得全部钢铁供应量的计划也没有实行。荷兰钢铁企业有点妒忌比利时，便尽量增加依穆顿的钢铁产量，比利时因此大为不满。荷兰纺织业为保护自己，而出来反对比国纺织品的大量输入。事情就象这样地在继续进行着。
    荷比两国财政方面的合作也同样是一幅忧郁的图画。荷盾与比国法郎的官定兑换率是一比十六。但照黑市价格，荷盾仅可换得八法郎，敏感地反映了荷币的脆弱性。如果关税壁垒撤消，一比八的兑换率便会流行，很明显地，这对荷兰商人不利。
    两国商人谁都不愿为“比尼卢”的利益而牺牲他们自己的利益。
    安特渥普及鹿特丹两地航业界间的争论尤具特色。当调整两大海港的作用的问题被提出时，比国商人马上就激烈地反对取消安特渥普现有的任何特权。安特渥普商会开会时，商会主席费特烈·阿斯德里斯宣布：
    “‘比尼卢’所包含的意义，我们完全了解，并且愿为它而牺牲。但是，我们的牺牲却也有个限度。总有一天我们是会要考虑‘比尼卢’是不是还有存在价值的问题的。”
    在这种情形下，过去两年中三国政府间重复举行的很多会议不能收到任何效果便不值得惊奇了。今年三月，“比尼卢”的部长们又再度集会于海牙。这次扩大会议的唯一收获是将经济联盟延长至一九五○年七月一日并且决定本年七月一日为统一关税的日期，但根据新闻纸的报导这个决议不象会付诸实行。
    　　　　　　　　　※　　　　　　　　　※　　　　　　　※
    由此看来，比尼卢三国合并为一的理想虽然已经郑重地宣布五年了，其执行上则无任何进展。时间的进行一步一步地把当初一九四四年在伦敦宣布成立“比尼卢”的那些政客们的动机明朗化起来。荷、比、卢三个国家各不相同，经济上尤有尖锐的对立，但却有一件事无异：美国资本的渗入以及美国垄断资本的空前强大。
    在荷兰城市里，你一会儿便可以碰到一个怪人：一个穿着缝有美国国旗的衣服的年青人。这便是马歇尔计划的公开标记，比尼卢集团中的三个国家目前都正在尝着马歇尔计划苦果的滋味。
    比利时是个很典型的例子。这个工业很发达的国家已由欧洲一个工业产品的制造者退转为一个美国商品的市场了。它从美国运来香烟，皮鞋，衣服，长统袜等，不用说，还有口香糖。同时，美国货把比国货从法国，荷兰，卢森堡的市场挤出来。素为比国主要输出品之一的金属品至今还只及战前输出额的百分之四十五。煤炭和焦炭也遭遇到市场的困难，而大量含灰量达百分之五十的劣等煤却从美国运来。
    在美国官员指导之下，马歇尔计划中的贷款正用于战略的建设工作——扩大军港设备，建筑飞机场，重修铁路公路等等。在比利时国家银行之下的工业贷款公司不能自主地决定贷款的用途，有两位美国“顾问”监督分配。一个八百万人口的国家却有三十万人在失业的事实是今日比利时工业状况最好的说明。
    在荷兰，马歇尔化的结果更加糟，尤其是被剥夺了市场的农业。蔬菜不能在西德进口，千万吨的白薯，胡瓜和蕃茄都烂在储菜场里。一九四五、一九四六两年英国在菜蔬成熟的季节停止荷兰蔬菜的输入，荷兰菜商不得不压低菜价，亏本出卖。
    美国垄断资本阻碍荷兰造船业的发展而叫荷兰人购用陈旧的美国船。美国拒绝将高度钢及造船设备供应荷兰船坞；拨给荷兰的机器设备不过占马歇尔计划中荷兰所得全部物资总数的百分之五。
    另一方面，一些美国公司却在荷兰大量投资建立新的工厂：凯撒——胡吕查汽车公司设于鹿特丹，其设备装置则分属芝加哥起重机公司及荷美车胎公司（固特异橡皮公司的附属公司）。新近设立的荷美交通信号设备制造厂也由美国通用铁道信号公司投了资。美国瑞姆制造公司也成立一个荷兰分公司，专门制造化学工业及制油工业的包装材料。
    美国商人想利用“比尼卢”这个并不存在的国家一下就把三小国的经济掌握过来。当比荷两国的资本家正在闹蹩扭的时候，美国垄断资本便充分地利用这个机会。例如，西德的英美当局便在安特渥普和鹿特丹发生摩擦的时候把货物从贝拉门和汉堡运入德国。为了防止荷比两国称心如意地交换蔬菜和钢铁，美国垄断资本家便以一种冷酷的现实摆在两国人民面前：何兰买美国的金属品，比利时买美国的干菜。分析到最后，关税壁垒撤消后唯一的获利者便是美国出口商。他们之所以老是叫嚣撤除关税制度以及其他阻碍物，为的是要毫无阻碍地在经济方面侵略西欧各国。
    美国政客们也同时进行一项对他们来说是非常重要的活动：把这三个国家变为侵略的桥头阵地。比荷的参谋人员经常在英美的指导下磋商军事。荷兰军官访问比国兵营并参观比国陆军的演习；比国军事代表也应邀赴荷。这些活动都是英美所指使的。西欧联盟总司令部主席蒙哥马利元帅经常访问布鲁塞尔和海牙。
    军国主义的宣传很猖獗。比利时的城市中到处贴着全付武装的青年军人的招贴画，怂恿比利时人：“到军队中找事业前途去！”底下的注解则亲切地告诉你：“欲知详情，请往布鲁塞尔德列地方巴多因王子兵营一询便知”。战前只有一连兵力的卢森堡也正在大扩其“陆军”。
    比国某进步报纸上新近登出了一幅漫画：一艘标有“比尼卢马歇尔计划号”的大轮船将两个憔悴的工人——一个荷兰，一个比利时——压得焦头烂额，一个高兴得要命的美国商人在旁观。
    比尼卢计划没有给三国人民任何好处。在一段漫长的时日里，他们受骗于“经济合作”的幸福前途的谎话。在经济合作谈判的烟幕下，比、荷、卢三国被诱入侵略集团。现在，事实把西洋镜拆穿了，三国人民开始发觉过去的一切不过是一个大规模的政治骗局，其目的是要在经济上政治上奴役三个国家并且使它们成为西欧集团的作战前哨和侵略基地。
    美、英的外交家想把“比尼卢”这个不成为国家的国家作为玩弄政治阴谋的柜台，三个国家的人民却不会被这种阴谋所利用。荷兰亚姆斯特丹一个老工人有一天对我说：
    “‘比尼卢’这玩意儿使我想起一群小狗在打架，而它们共同的主人则在前面使劲拉的场面。在这种情势下，我们永远是找不到快乐的。”
