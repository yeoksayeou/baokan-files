Visiting Zuo Xiezong

　　Zuo Xiezong was in Yulin, Shaanxi, leading the former Kuomintang Twenty-second Army when he accepted Chairman Mao's proposed peace plan and joined the People's Liberation Army. This time he attended the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. When the reporter went to interview him, he first told me that since the liberation of Yulin, the people have enthusiastically supported the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army. The facts he personally experienced made him clearer day by day. He said that during the period when he decided to join the People's Liberation Army, he did not understand the Chinese Communist Party very well. On the one hand, he was deceived and蒙蔽ed by the Kuomintang reactionaries, and on the other hand, his own political understanding was not enough. He lived in Yulin for more than a month, and in July of this year he traveled from Yulin through the democratic holy land of Yan'an, Xi'an, and Shanxi to Beijing. He saw the new China and the fact that the Chinese Communist Party was wholeheartedly serving the people. The responsible comrades of the CPC's party, government, and military in various places often helped him, and the comrades who worked together were as harmonious as family brothers. Because of all these new things and new education, he said that his own understanding had been improved. What he saw and heard in the Liberated Areas for two or three months was like studying at a revolutionary university, clarifying his own thoughts. Now standing under the banner of Chairman Mao and on the side of the people makes him very happy.

　　How did the Kuomintang reactionaries oppress the people? He said: "Take the propaganda of the reactionary newspapers, for example. The news from the Central News Agency is all rumors. For example, after the peaceful liberation of Beiping, the Kuomintang reactionary newspapers in Yulin falsely accused the Chinese Communist Party, saying that Fu Zuoyi was forced to commit suicide and Deng Baoshan lost his freedom. Look, how ridiculous is this kind of shameful rumor? When the Nanjing Kuomintang reactionaries rejected the domestic peace agreement and Zhang Zhizhong voluntarily and resolutely stayed in Beiping, the Central News Agency spread rumors that the Chinese Communist Party had detained Zhang Zhizhong. Who would want to trust a government that deceives the people like this?"

　　Then, Zuo Xiezong said: The Kuomintang reactionaries have ruled China for more than 20 years and have long lost the hearts of the people. However, this group of reactionaries still want to rely on American imperialism to increase their crimes of harming the country and the people. They would rather let MacArthur, Marshall, and Acheson be the "governors" of China or the supreme emperors of their Chiang family's small court. Aren't these shameless criminals who have no national concept at all more despicable than Shi Jingtang and Qin Hui? Zuo Xiezong said excitedly here, "All patriotic people with conscience should immediately turn around and turn to Chairman Mao's side. Following the reactionaries again means being a running dog of the American imperialism, a great sinner of the nation, and only destruction awaits in the end."

　　Speaking of bandit Hu Zongnan, Zuo Xiezong said with a smile: "Bandit Hu will soon be caught. His crimes of harming the people are too deep. His subordinates have long been unwilling to fight with him. When bandit Hu fled Xi'an, many subordinates and gentry were unwilling to go with him. He was so angry that he temporarily sent a lot of cars and forced them to get into the cars and dragged them away. Since bandit Hu's four armies were annihilated, they have long been defeated. The complete liberation of the Great Northwest is just around the corner."

　　When Zuo Xiezong talked about the People's Political Consultative Conference, he believed that "this political consultative conference is the first grand event in Chinese history. Here, we truly see China's democratic politics." He said: "In the future, we must study hard, improve our understanding, unite around Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, and in accordance with the principles of New Democracy, all parties in the country will openly and honestly discuss state affairs, think of everything for the people, and the future of the new China is too bright."

  　访问左协中
    左协中是在陕西榆林率领前国民党二十二军是接受毛主席所提和平方案，参加人民解放军的。这次他出席了中国人民政协。在记者去访问他时，他首先对我说，自从榆林解放以后，人民大众热烈拥护中国共产党和人民解放军，他亲身经历到的事实使自己一天天的清楚起来，他说在他决定参加人民解放军的期间，对于中国共产党还不很了解，一方面是受了国民党反动派的欺骗蒙蔽，一方面也由于自己的政治认识不够。他在榆林住了一个多月，今年七月从榆林经过民主圣地延安、西安、经山西到北京，他看到了新的中国，见着了中国共产党一心一意为人民服务的事实，中共各地党政军负责同志又常常帮助他，在一块儿工作的同志又都融洽得如同家庭弟兄一般。由于这一切新的事物和新的教育，他说使得他自己的认识提高了。在解放区两三个月的所见所闻，象是在革命大学里读书一样，把自己的思想弄清楚了，现在站到毛主席旗帜下，站到人民方面来，这使自己很高兴。
    国民党反动派是怎样欺压人民呢？他谈道：“就拿反动报纸的宣传来说吧，中央社的消息尽是造谣，例如北平和平解放后，榆林的国民党反动报纸却诬蔑中国共产党，说是傅作义被迫自杀，邓宝珊失去了自由，你看，这种可耻的造谣，多么可笑？当南京国民党反动派拒绝了国内和平协定，张治中自动的毅然的留在北平的时候，中央社却造谣说，中国共产党扣押了张治中。象这种欺骗人民的政府，谁还想信任它。”
    接着，左协中说：国民党反动派统治了中国二十多年，早已丧失了民心。然而这伙反动派直到今天，还想依赖美帝国主义，来增长他们祸国殃民的罪恶，他们宁愿让麦克阿瑟、马歇尔和艾奇逊之流来当中国的“总督”或他们蒋家小朝廷的太上皇，他们这种寡廉鲜耻没有一丝一毫民族观念的罪人，岂不是比石敬塘、秦桧更要卑鄙得多吗？左协中谈到这里，激动的说，“凡是有良心的爱国志士，应该马上倒过来，倒向毛主席这边来。再跟着反动派，就是美帝的走狗，民族的大罪人，最后只有灭亡。”
    说及胡匪宗南，左协中笑着说：“胡匪不久就要落网，他残害人民的罪恶太深了，他的部下早不愿跟他打仗了。在胡匪逃出西安的时候，有很多部属和士绅都不愿跟他走，他气坏了，临时派了好多汽车，硬逼着他们上车，死死地拖走的。自从胡匪四个军消灭后，早已溃不成军，全部解放大西北，即在眼前。”
    左协中谈到人民政协时，认为“这次政协，是中国有史以来的第一次盛举，在这里，真正看到了中国的民主政治”。他说：“今后我们要好好的学习，提高自己的认识，团结在毛主席和共产党的周围，依照新民主主义的原则，全国各党派都开诚布公的来商讨国是，一切为人民着想，新中国的前途是太光明了。”
