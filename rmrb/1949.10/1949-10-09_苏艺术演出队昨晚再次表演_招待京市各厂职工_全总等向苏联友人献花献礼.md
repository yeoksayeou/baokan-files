    演出之前，全总副主席李立三致词欢迎以法捷耶夫为首的苏联文化艺术科学工作者代表团，并向他们表示敬意和感谢。于历数苏联人民对中国人民的关心和帮助后，号召全国工人向苏联工人学习。苏联演出队名导演格拉西莫夫致词说：苏联人民一直以诚挚的心情注视着中国人民解放军英勇的斗争业迹。中国人民解放军在自己的经得住考验的英明的领袖毛泽东主席领导下，在以朱德总司令为首百战百胜的将军的指挥下，获得光辉灿烂的胜利，这是中国人民的光荣，也是地球上人民的光荣。
    全国总工会向苏联代表团献花后，就开始表演。有全俄音乐家演出家比赛会上获奖的苏联国立音乐协会的钢琴独奏家柯拉夫青柯、有三次荣获斯大林奖金的杜金斯卡娅等数十位苏联优秀的音乐家、舞蹈家参加演出。演奏了“东方罗曼史”、“中国之鼓”等十多名曲，“唐·吉柯德双人舞”及最精彩的“红军舞”等，热烈的鼓掌声如骤风暴雨响遍全场。
    苏联同志表演完了，由北京市总工会、七十兵工厂等献礼。七十兵工厂献旗写着“中苏两国人民深厚友谊万岁！”
    然后由华北军区军乐队、华北人民文工团、华大文工团等演奏了“人民解放军进行曲”、“淮海战役组曲”、“黄河大合唱”等节目，并放映苏联代表团送给我国人民的五彩电影片“五一节”，然后尽欢而散。
