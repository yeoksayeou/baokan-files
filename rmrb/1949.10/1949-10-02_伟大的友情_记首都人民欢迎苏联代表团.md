Great Friendship
    —A Record of the People of the Capital Welcoming the Soviet Delegation

    No day could be more moving than October 1st. This is not only because of seeing people reveling in wild cheers for the birth of their new country; but also because of seeing the delegation of Soviet cultural, artistic, and scientific workers from distant Moscow, directly bringing us the great, glorious friendship.

    Various chrysanthemums decorated the neat platform of Beijing East Station. Before the train arrived, the platform was quiet. The welcoming representatives, wearing red ribbons on their chests, some of whom had been to Moscow, were talking in low voices about the names of familiar Soviet friends, while others were guessing the kind of enthusiastic scene that would unfold later. But they all thought of one thing: it was the blood of countless martyrs that enabled the Chinese people and the great friendly country, the Soviet Union, to express brotherly friendship so directly.

    At exactly eleven o'clock, when the train arrived, everyone on the platform looked at the faces of every Soviet friend. Before the train stopped, Soviet friends extended their hands to the welcoming crowd. We finally met. The Chinese people had long been looking forward to such a day, and today, our wish has finally come true.

    Why does this great, glorious friendship make each of us so excited? This is because, as Guo Moruo said: "The obstacles hindering further close cooperation between our two great nations, China and the Soviet Union, have been removed." No one can hinder us, no one can destroy us. We have won the victory of the war, which not only gave birth to a new China, but also allowed the friendship between our two great nations, China and the Soviet Union, to develop and consolidate better. Our beloved Fadeyev and his comrades kept nodding and smiling. His speech was interrupted by applause from time to time, and he himself applauded enthusiastically. His words aroused a burning resonance in people's hearts.

    When the delegation stepped out of the station, more than two thousand people warmly surrounded them. Thirty Young Pioneers, boys and girls, holding gorgeous flowers, clustered around the delegation. Every Soviet friend had their hands filled with flowers, representing the warm flowers of the people of the capital. The Soviet friends kindly held the children's hands and stroked their hair. For a moment, laughter filled the air. Pure children understand in wartime who are our friends and who are our enemies. The children's joy and enthusiasm for the arrival of Soviet friends were expressed by surrounding the delegation for a long time.

    The Soviet delegation was surrounded by the welcoming crowd several times. Even after getting into the cars, the cars could not move. The cheers shook the entire station. On October 1st, the Chinese people not only solemnly declared the birth of the new People's Republic, but also practically and directly expressed that the Chinese people will forever stand with the great friendly country, the Soviet Union, to defend lasting world peace.

　　伟大的友情
    —记首都人民欢迎苏联代表团
    没有十月一日这一天再能使人这样感动。这不但是因为看到人们纵情狂热欢呼自己新国家的诞生；而且，还因为看到从遥远的莫斯科来的苏联文化艺术科学工作者代表团，给我们直接带来了伟大的、光荣情的友。
    各色的菊花装饰着整洁的北京东站月台，列车尚未来到时，月台上静悄悄的。胸前飘着红绸条子的欢迎代表们，有的是到过莫斯科的，他们在低声谈论着熟悉的苏联朋友的名字，有的则在猜测等一会那种热烈的情景，但却一致都曾经想到：是无数先烈的鲜血，才能够使中国人民和伟大的友邦苏联，这样直接地来表示兄弟般的友谊。
    十一点正，当列车来到的时刻，月台上所有的人全望遍了每个苏联朋友的面孔，车尚未停止，苏联朋友就把手伸向欢迎的人群，我们终于会面了。中国人民很早就期待着有这样一个日子，今天，我们的愿望终于实现了。
    为什么伟大的、光荣的友情，会使我们每一个人这样激动。这是因为正如郭沫若所说：“阻碍我们中苏两大民族进一步密切合作的障碍已经铲除。”没有人可以阻挠我们，没有人可以破坏我们，我们获得了战争的胜利，不但诞生了一个新的中国，同时，我们中苏两大民族的友谊也由此会更好的发展与巩固起来，我们敬爱的法捷耶夫和他的同志们一直点着头，微笑着，他的讲话，时时被掌声所中断，他自己也热烈的鼓着掌，他的话在人们的心上引起灼热的共鸣。
    当代表团步出车站时，两千多群众又热烈的包围了他们。三十个男女儿童团员捧着绚丽的鲜花簇拥到代表团中，每一个苏联朋友手中是接不完的鲜花，这表示首都人民热情的鲜花。苏联的朋友亲切的拉着孩子们的手，抚摸着他们头发，一时欢笑遍地。纯洁的孩子们在战争中明白懂得谁是我们的朋友，谁是我们的敌人。对于苏联朋友的到来，久久的围住代表团表示了孩子们的喜悦和热情。
    苏联代表团曾几次被欢迎的人群所包围，就是坐上了汽车以后，汽车还是无法开动，欢呼的声音震憾了整个车站。十月一日这一天，中国人民不但庄严地宣告了新的人民共和国的诞生，同时实际而又直接的表示了中国人民要永远和伟大的友邦苏联站在一起，保卫世界的持久和平。
