　　Studying Methods of Writing Reform, Preparing Conditions for Writing Reform
    Chinese Writing Reform Association
    Holds Inaugural Meeting Yesterday
    [Our Newspaper] The inaugural meeting of the Chinese Writing Reform Association was held yesterday (the 10th) at 2:00 PM in the Xiehe Auditorium in Beijing. Attendees included over a hundred people, including language workers from across the country, representatives of overseas Chinese and minority nationalities, and guests from various circles. The meeting was opened by Chairman Wu Yuzhang, who delivered an opening speech (see separate article), reported on the preparations for the Chinese Writing Reform Association and the significance of its establishment, and encouraged everyone to work together actively under the sponsorship of the People's Government to carry out the writing reform movement. Subsequently, guests Yu Li, Ji Wenfu, and Li Yunchang, and members Xu Teli, Li Jinxi, Luo Changpei, and Lu Zhiwei, among others, spoke. Everyone unanimously pointed out the importance of writing reform at the present time, believing that the new script is not only the only powerful tool for eliminating illiteracy, but also a powerful tool for developing a new culture. At the same time, efforts should be made to carry out language education work and closely connect with the broad masses, so that the people themselves can master the new cultural tools. At the meeting, the charter of the Chinese Writing Reform Association was adopted, and seventy-eight directors were elected (leaving two vacancies for language workers in the areas to be liberated). Finally, Chairman Wu Yuzhang delivered the closing remarks, and the meeting adjourned at around 6:00 PM.
