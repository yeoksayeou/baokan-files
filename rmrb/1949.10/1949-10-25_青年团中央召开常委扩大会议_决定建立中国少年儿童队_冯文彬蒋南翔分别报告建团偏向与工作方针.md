Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 24th: The Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League held an enlarged meeting of its Standing Committee from October 6th to 14th. Twenty-eight members of the Central Committee of the Youth League and responsible comrades from various departments of the Central Committee attended the meeting. This was the largest meeting of members of the Central Committee of the Youth League and key cadres since the Youth League Congress and the First Plenary Session of the League.

The main agenda items at this meeting were three: (1) Listening to work reports from various regions and major cities. The units reporting to this meeting included North China, East China, Central China, Northeast China, Northwest China, and major cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Nanjing. (2) Feng Wenbin's report "On Overcoming the Closed-Doorism Deviation in the Work of the Youth League." He pointed out that since the Youth League Congress, the number of Youth League members has grown to nearly 500,000. The Youth League has played a promoting role in welcoming liberation and various mobilization efforts in newly liberated cities, in summer studies, in factory production, and in school studies. However, in the work of some regions and some units, the spirit of the CCP Central Committee's decision on building the League and the resolutions of the First Youth League Congress have not been implemented. Closed-doorism tendencies have occurred in League building work, organizational development, and the relationship between the League and the masses. Feng Wenbin also analyzed in detail the various reasons for the emergence of closed-doorism and proposed specific methods to overcome it. (3) Jiang Nanxiang's report on the work guidelines of the Youth League in schools, proposing that future work in schools should and must pay attention to the fundamental differences from student work before liberation. The central task of student work should be to carry out New Democratic studies. When social order has become relatively stable after liberation and schools have normally started classes, student work should gradually shift to focusing on regular coursework. The Youth League's work in schools should also arrange its work around the main task of study. In order to realize this guideline, the Youth League's organizational life and social activities need to be streamlined, and cooperation and collaboration with school teachers and education authorities must be strived for.

　　青年团中央召开常委扩大会议
  　决定建立中国少年儿童队       
    冯文彬蒋南翔分别报告建团偏向与工作方针
    【新华社北京二十四日电】中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会从十月六日到十四日召集了中央常委扩大会议。参加此次会议的计有青年团中央委员二十八人及团中央各部门的负责同志。这是青年团代表大会及团的一中全会以来青年团中央委员及主要干部出席人数最多的一次会议。
    在这次会议上的主要议程有三：（一）听取了各地区各主要城市的工作汇报。向此次会议报告工作的单位计有华北、华东、华中、东北、西北等地区以及北京、天津、上海、武汉、南京等主要城市。（二）冯文彬“关于克服青年团在工作中的关门主义偏向”的报告。他指出：青年团代表大会以来，青年团员已发展近五十万人，在新解放城市的迎接解放与各种动员工作中，在暑期学习中，在工厂生产中与学校的学习中，青年团都起了推动作用。但在某些地区某些单位的工作中，没有贯彻中共中央建团决议与青年团第一次代表大会决议精神，在建团工作，发展组织，团与群众关系等方面，发生了关门主义的倾向。冯文彬并详细地分析了产生关门主义的各种原因，并提出了具体克服关门主义的方法。（三）蒋南翔关于青年团在学校中的工作方针的报告，提出：今后学校的工作，应该和必须注意到和过去解放前的学生工作的基本区别，应以展开新民主主义的学习作为学生工作的中心任务。在解放后社会秩序已经相当稳定，学校已经正常地开学上课的时候，学生工作就应逐渐地转变到以正课学习为中心，青年团在学校的工作，也应围绕学习的主要任务来布置自己的工作。为了实现这个方针，青年团的组织生活和社会活动，需要加以精简，并必须争取和学校教师与教育当局的配合与合作。
