　　Banning Reactionary Radio Stations and Strengthening the People's Broadcasting Undertaking

The Beijing Military Control Commission, in accordance with the demands of the broad masses of people in Beijing and based on the provision in the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to "suppress all counter-revolutionary activities," yesterday shut down three reactionary radio stations in the city, namely China, Minsheng, and Junyou. This is an appropriate measure to further consolidate the revolutionary order of the people in Beijing. From now on, the people of Beijing and the surrounding areas will no longer be deceived and poisoned by reactionary broadcasts.

After a long investigation by the Military Control Commission, the facts have been fully ascertained that these three radio stations were run by Kuomintang reactionaries and special agents, and were engaged in counter-revolutionary propaganda before the liberation of Beijing, with conclusive evidence. After the liberation of Beijing, they still used the name of private radio stations to secretly carry out counter-revolutionary activities, continuously disseminating decadent music with feudal and comprador elements to continue to numb the broad masses of people, and deceiving customers lacking common sense with false and exaggerated cheap advertisements. The citizens of Beijing have continuously sent letters suggesting that the government severely ban them. The People's Government, with the most serious and prudent attitude, conducted the most thorough investigation and research by the competent authorities, and issued an order to ban them after obtaining sufficient evidence, demonstrating its consistent responsible spirit to the people.

Radio stations are modern and powerful propaganda tools. Their connection with the broad masses of people is very close, and they can often influence a large number of listeners. Before the liberation of Beijing and other large cities, this tool was generally in the hands of the feudal and comprador classes and their concentrated representatives, the Kuomintang bandits, becoming an important part of their entire counter-revolutionary propaganda machine. Their broadcasts were filled with slavish, backward, numbing, and low-taste programs, in order to poison the people. In addition to a number of openly government-run radio stations, they also used other gray facades, under the guise of private operation, to set up radio stations, supported and directed by special agents, to carry out various criminal propaganda activities. When these cities were liberated and the people gained power, the people demanded to master this important propaganda tool, making it the most convenient tool for educating the masses, raising the political consciousness and cultural level of the masses, disseminating work experience, and promoting production and construction. The Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference also specifically stipulates that "the people's broadcasting undertaking should be developed." Therefore, in addition to running state-owned radio stations well, we should also allow the existence of truly private radio stations, as long as they do not engage in reactionary propaganda activities that undermine the interests of the state and the people, and do not use broadcasting to carry out rumors, deception, and slander, and truly serve the people, and we should help them to progress. However, we must not allow any counter-revolutionaries to mix in private radio stations under any name. For them, we must resolutely ban them according to the seriousness of their crimes. The banning of reactionary radio stations and the development of the people's broadcasting undertaking are two aspects of the same policy.

### 取缔反动广播电台加强人民广播事业

　　取缔反动广播电台加强人民广播事业
    北京市军管会顺应京市广大人民的要求，根据人民政协共同纲领中“镇压一切反革命活动”的规定，于昨日查封本市中国、民生、军友等三家反动广播电台，这是进一步巩固北京市人民革命秩序的恰当措施，从此北京市和附近地区的人民再不会受到反动广播的欺骗与毒害了。
    经过军管会长期调查之后，事实已完全判明这三家广播电台，均为国民党反动派特务分子所主办，在北京解放以前，即从事反革命的罪恶宣传，证据确凿；在北京解放以后，它们仍假私营广播电台之名，暗地进行反革命活动，并不断传播具有封建买办毒素的靡靡之音，继续麻醉广大人民；以虚伪夸张的廉价广告，欺骗缺乏常识的顾客。北京市民曾不断投函建议政府严加取缔，人民政府以最严肃而谨慎的态度，由主管机关进行了最周密的调查研究，于取得充分证据后，始下令查封，表现了对人民一贯的负责精神。
    广播电台是近代化的强有力的宣传工具。它和广大人民的联系是非常密切的，它经常能够影响大量的听众。在北京和其他大城市解放以前，这个工具一般说来绝大多数是操在封建买办阶级及其集中的代表者国民党匪帮手里，成为其整个反革命宣传机器的重要组成部分，在它们的广播中，充满了奴化、落后、麻醉性与低级趣味的节目，借以毒害人民。除了若干公开的官办广播电台以外，它们还利用其他灰色面貌，假借私营名义，设立广播台，由特务分子支持和主使，进行各种罪恶的宣传活动。当着这些城市获得解放，人民获得了政权之后，人民就要求掌握这个重要的宣传工具，使它成为教育群众，提高群众的政治觉悟和文化水平，传播工作经验，推动生产建设的最便捷的利器。中国人民政治协商会议的共同纲领中，还特别规定要“发展人民广播事业”，因此，我们除了应该办好国营广播电台外，对于真正私营广播电台，只要它不从事破坏国家人民利益的反动宣传活动，不利用广播进行造谣欺骗与诽谤，真正为人民服务，不但允许其存在，还要帮助他们的进步。但是我们决不能允许任何反革命分子，假借任何名义混杂于私营广播台之中，对于它们，必须根据其罪恶的轻重，坚决地分别予以取缔。对于反动广播电台的取缔，和发展人民广播事业正是一个政策的两方面。
