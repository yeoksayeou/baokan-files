Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 23rd: TASS Moscow reports: The Red Navy newspaper commented on "Nehru's Trip to Washington" in its international commentary on the 22nd, stating: Indian Prime Minister Nehru is going to Washington for a long-term visit. It was officially announced that Nehru's trip is in the nature of a "goodwill visit." Nehru himself announced that he intends to use this trip to "discuss many issues in Washington." American newspapers have not concealed the fact that the United States' purpose is to use the negotiations with Nehru to strengthen American imperialism's influence over India and turn India into a bulwark against the rising forces of liberation in Asia. The grand ceremony arranged to welcome Nehru's arrival in Washington proves the importance that the American ruling clique attaches to this meeting.

It is quite obvious that the American reactionary ruling clique feels deeply alarmed by the tremendous achievements of the Chinese people and the surging national liberation movement of the Asian people. In view of India's huge manpower and raw material reserves, they have given India a particularly prominent position in their adventurous plans.

In recent months, the economic, military, and political infiltration of the United States into India has been particularly active. It must be pointed out that India's reactionary ruling clique has gladly opened the door wide to American expansion. It is by no means accidental that Nehru, in his many speeches in the United States, has particularly emphasized the prospect of American "help" to India's economy.

The commentator pointed out that American monopoly capitalists are rudely striving to take the place of Britain in India. This can be estimated from the materials provided by the American "Foreign Trade Weekly." The magazine pointed out that in 1940, the total amount of American exports to India was only 31 million US dollars, while in 1947, the total amount of exports reached 410 million US dollars. The article emphasized the opportunity for further penetration of American capital into India.

The commentator wrote in conclusion that the Indian Nayak newspaper said very clearly: "After the demise of Chiang Kai-shek's government, his position as an agent of American imperialism is vacant, so the American imperialists intend to replace Chiang Kai-shek with Nehru." Indian progressive public opinion has expressed deep concern about Nehru's negotiations in the United States, and emphasized that American imperialism can only make India intensify its colonial oppression and new exploitation of the people.

### 红海军报评尼赫鲁访美

  　评尼赫鲁访美
    【新华社北京二十三日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：红海军报于二十二日国际述评中评“尼赫鲁的华盛顿之行”称：印度总理尼赫鲁去华盛顿作长时期的访问。官方宣布尼赫鲁之行是属于“善意访问”的性质。尼赫鲁自己宣布，他打算利用此行“在华盛顿讨论许多问题”。美国报章并未掩盖下一事实，即美国的目的是利用与尼赫鲁的谈判，以便加强美帝国主义对印度的影响，并把印度变成反对亚洲高涨着的解放力量的堡垒。欢迎尼赫鲁抵华盛顿所布置的隆重仪式，证明美国统治集团对这次会见的重视。
    十分明显，美国反动统治集团对于中国人民所获得的非常成就和亚洲人民汹涌澎湃的民族解放运动，感到深深的惊恐。它们鉴于印度具有巨大的人力和原料贮藏，所以在其冒险计划中，对于印度给了特别突出的地位。
    最近几个月内，美国对印度经济、军事及政治的渗入，已显得特别活跃。必须指出：印度的反动统治集团对美国的扩张，欣然地大开门户。尼赫鲁在其在美国的多次演说中，都特别强调美国对印度经济“帮助”的前途，这是绝非偶然的。
    评论员指出，美国独占资本家正粗鲁地力求取英国在印度的地位而代之。这点可由美国“国外贸易周刊”所提供的材料，加以估计。该杂志指明，一九四○年，美国对印度的输出总额仅三千一百万美元，而一九四七年的输出总额，则达四亿一千万美元。这篇文章着重指出美国资本进一步渗入印度的机会。
    评论员在结语中写道，印度奈达吉报很明白地说：“蒋介石的政府灭亡以后，他的作为美帝国主义代理人的职位是空下了，所以，美帝国主义者打算用尼赫鲁代替蒋介石”。印度进步舆论对尼赫鲁在美国的谈判，表示深切的忧虑，并着重指出：美帝国主义只能使得印度加紧对人民施行殖民地压迫和新的剥削。
