　　The Creative Process of "Victory Crossing the Yangtze"
    The script of "Victory Crossing the Yangtze" was written collectively by Hu Qi, Bai Ai, and Zhao Fuzheng, comrades from the Second and Third Field Armies who personally participated in the Yangtze River Crossing Campaign, together with Comrade Hu Danfei from the National Literary Association's Creation Department, under the guidance of Comrade Ding Ling, and with the assistance of comrades from the National Literary Association's Creation Department. The entire process took less than twenty days. We knew that it wouldn't be easy to write a piece that reflects the historically significant major event of the People's Liberation Army breaking through the Kuomintang's "Yangtze Defense Line" in these short twenty days. Although we have been working on the front lines of the Liberation War for several years, due to the frequency of the war, the urgency of time, our own low ideological level, and the fact that we have only focused on news reporting for the troops in recent years, we dared not expect to write a large work of 100,000 or 200,000 words.
    After the Literary and Art Congress, the task of vigorously "reflecting the People's Liberation War" and "expressing our heroic era" was put forward more clearly and urgently, and the creative enthusiasm of the comrades in the troops was also aroused. However, there were still many new difficulties in how to organize and concentrate this enthusiasm. The responsible comrades of the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles personally helped us solve this difficulty; they personally organized, led, and encouraged us, gave us confidence, and proposed the task: to bring "Crossing the River" to the stage.
    At that time, several of us comrades did not know each other. Although we all participated in the crossing, the materials that each person saw, experienced, and mastered were different. Because of different opinions, we sometimes held our own views. We are grateful for the encouragement from Ding Ling and other comrades. They wanted us to talk about the story first in a chaotic way, to break our concerns, and to initiate arguments. In order to unify different opinions, we had to thoroughly express our own opinions, and arguing was okay.
    After continuous discussion and research, we finally slowly gained confidence and decided to write this script quickly and contribute it to the representatives of the People's Political Consultative Conference.
    The central idea of the script "Victory Crossing the Yangtze" is to show that the People's Liberation Army, without warships or steamers, relied on small wooden boats and the bravery of the People's Liberation Army to break through the natural barrier of the Yangtze River heavily guarded by the Kuomintang. It mainly shows how the People's Liberation Army transitioned from land operations to mastering water operations techniques; in the preparation for crossing the river, how the five-mile-wide Yangtze River was prepared for as if it were fifty miles, or even five hundred miles, this arduous and outstanding process of conquering difficulties.
    We have tried our best to make the theme of the script clearly expressed in the script, and we have made many efforts, but we have never been very satisfied.
    Let me also say a few words about the writing process: first, collectively think about the story and characters (even the characters' appearance and entrance are arranged in advance), then, each person plays a role, improvising lines while performing, and one person records. The advantage of this method is: fast (one scene is completed in one day), comprehensive care, and not prone to getting stuck in a dead end. The disadvantages are: hasty, many loopholes, and the characters' emotions are not coherent, even contradictory. It was not until the rehearsal, after the continuous pointing out by director Liu Yumin and comrades such as Jin Xin, that some corrections and supplements were made.
    If this play has one or two merits, it should be attributed to the great historical facts created by the front-line commanders and the enthusiastic help and guidance of Ding Ling and other comrades.
    The script has a total of three acts and will be jointly performed by the War Front Art Troupe and the People's Art Troupe. Please correct any rough spots.

　　“胜利渡长江”创作经过
    “胜利渡长江”剧本，是我们第二、三野战军几个亲身参加渡江战役的胡奇、白艾、赵夫征同志和文协创作部的胡丹沸同志，在丁玲同志指导下，以及全国文协创作部诸同志的帮助下，用集体创作的方法写出的。为时不足二十天。我们知道：要在这短短的二十天内，想写出解放军冲破国民党“长江防线”这一具有历史意义的重大事件，不是件太容易的事，几年来，我们虽一直工作在解放战争的前线，但，由于战争的频繁，时间的匆忙，本身思想水平的低，以及几年来我们所致力的仅是部队的新闻报导工作，因此，我们也不敢奢望写一部十万二十万字的大作品。
    文代大会结束后，要求大力“反映人民解放战争”，“表现我们英雄的时代”的任务，是提得更明确和更迫切了，而部队同志的创作热情也激动起来了，但，如何把这个热情组织起来，集中的表现出来，却还有不少新的困难。全国文联负责的同志们就亲自帮助我们解决了这个困难；亲自组织，领导我们，鼓励我们，给我们信心，向我们提出任务：把“渡江”搬到舞台上来演出。
    当时我们几个同志却互不相识，虽说都参加了渡江，但各人所看到的，体验到的，掌握到的材料，又各有不同，因见解不一，有时各执一端。感谢丁玲诸同志给我们的鼓励，他们要我们以扯乱谈的方式先谈故事，要我们打破顾虑，发起争论，为了统一不同的见解，就要彻底的发表自己的意见，争吵也不要紧。
    经过了不断讨论、研究，终于我们慢慢地有了信心，决意要把这个剧本很快写好，贡献到人民政协诸代表的面前。
    “胜利渡长江”剧本的中心思想是表现：解放军没有兵舰、轮船，但凭着小小的木船，和解放军的英勇，却冲破了国民党重兵把守的天险扬子江。主要表现：解放军怎样由陆地作战，转为掌握水上作战的技术；在渡江准备中，怎样把五里宽的长江，当作五十里，甚至五百里来准备的这个坚苦卓越、征服困难的过程。
    我们曾尽力使剧本主题思想，明确的表现在剧本里，我们作了许多的努力，但始终没有搞得很满意。
    关于写作过程，也顺便提两句：先集体想好故事和人物（甚至连人物出场、入场都先安排好），然后，每人扮演一个角色，边表演边凑台词，由一人作记录。这个方法的好处是：快（一天完成一场），照顾的全面，不致于钻进牛角尖里，爬不出来。缺点是：草率，漏洞多，人物情感不连贯，甚至前后矛盾。直至在排演中，经过导演刘郁民同志以及今欣等同志的不断指出后，才得到某些更正和补充。
    如果说，这个剧尚有一二可取之处，应该归功于前线指挥员创造的伟大史实，以及丁玲诸同志的热心帮助指导。
    该剧本共三幕，由战线文工团和人民文工团将联合演出，草率之处，还请大家指正。
