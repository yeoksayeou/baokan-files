Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 30th. Guo Moruo, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and Vice-Chairmen Mao Dun and Zhou Yang, and Tian Han, Chairman of the All-China Drama Workers Association, and Vice-Chairmen Yu Ling and Zhang Geng, sent a telegram to the Soviet State Maly Theatre, congratulating the 125th anniversary of the founding of the theatre. The telegram reads as follows:

To the esteemed gentlemen of the Soviet State Maly Theatre:

We, the literary and art workers and drama workers of the People's Republic of China, warmly celebrate the 125th anniversary of the founding of your esteemed theatre. The Chinese drama workers have long admired the advanced Russian realistic art established by the "Small Theatre" more than a century ago, and regard it as the direction of our study. The immortal work "The Storm" by the great Russian classical playwright Alexander Ostrovsky, which is inextricably linked to the glorious history of the "Small Theatre," was performed by our drama workers in Chinese in major cities such as Shanghai, Chongqing, and Kunming ten years ago, and was warmly welcomed by the vast audience every time. The history of modern Chinese drama is not very long, only forty years or so, but it is commendable that we have been exploring and pursuing the path of realism from the very beginning, and like the close association of the "Small Theatre" with the Russian revolutionary movement, our Chinese drama movement has also been associated with the Chinese revolutionary movement from the beginning. That is why we feel particularly close to and yearn for the great founders of the "Small Theatre" and their glorious successors. We and you, esteemed gentlemen, are in the same direction and are connected in spirit. On the occasion of the grand celebration of your esteemed theatre, we would like to express our respect to the 297 glorious workers of your theatre and wish your theatre greater success.

Guo Moruo, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and Vice-Chairmen Mao Dun and Zhou Yang; Tian Han, Chairman of the All-China Drama Workers Association, and Vice-Chairmen Yu Ling and Zhang Geng. October 27, 1949.

　　苏联国立小剧院成立百二十五周年　
    我文联剧协特电致贺
    【新华社北京三十日电】中华全国文学艺术界联合会主席郭沫若，副主席茅盾、周扬，中华全国戏剧工作者协会主席田汉、副主席于伶、张庚，致电苏联国立小剧院，祝贺该院成立一百二十五周年纪念，电文如下：苏联国立小剧院敬爱的先生们：
    我们，中华人民共和国的文艺工作者和戏剧工作者，热烈地庆贺贵院成立一百二十五周年纪念。中国的戏剧工作者久已钦佩一百多年前由“小戏院”树立了基础的俄罗斯先进的现实主义艺术，而且把它当作自己学习的方向。和“小戏院”的光荣历史不可分离的伟大的俄罗斯古典戏曲家亚历山大·奥斯特洛夫斯基的不朽的作品“大雷雨”，十年以前，就曾经由我们的戏剧工作者用中国语文，在上海、重庆、昆明等各大都市演出，每次都获得广大观众们的热烈欢迎。中国的现代戏剧的历史，不算太长，只有四十来年，可是值得称道的，是我们一开始就向着现实主义的道路探研追求，而且也和“小戏院”之与俄国革命运动密切关联着一样，我们中国的戏剧运动自始也和中国革命运动关联着。这就是为什么我们对于“小戏院”的伟大的奠基者及其光荣的继承者特别感到亲密而向往。我们和你们，敬爱的先生们，方向是一致的，精神上是联系的；在此贵院庆祝盛典的机会，谨对贵院的二百九十七位光荣的工作者表示敬意，并祝贵院获得更大的成功。
    中华全国文学艺术界联合会主席郭沫若，副主席茅盾、周扬；中华全国戏剧工作者协会主席田汉，副主席于伶，张庚。于一九四九年十月二十七日。
