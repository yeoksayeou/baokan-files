Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 10th: Tass, Paris dispatch: Amidst calls from various democratic groups in France for the establishment of a democratic and unified government, French Communist Party General Secretary Thorez, after meeting with French President Auriol on the 6th, issued the following statement to reporters: We have told the President that merely changing a government is not enough; it is necessary to change the entire policy. The policy implemented thus far has proven to be completely wrong. We also put forward the basic policy principles that we believe must be implemented to avoid national collapse, as follows: (1) Abandon the Marshall Plan, the Atlantic Pact, and all agreements related to them. France actively participates in all endeavors to establish a just, democratic, and lasting peace based on respect for agreements between allied countries and the United Nations Charter, and ratifies the Franco-Soviet alliance guaranteeing France's peace and security. (2) Fight for the prohibition of atomic weapons and the conclusion of a five-power peace treaty between France, the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and China. (3) Fulfill the Potsdam Agreement on the eradication of Nazism and German militarism, and abolish all agreements stipulating the establishment of a West German government. Following such a policy towards Germany would be in line with our security interests. Retain the right to obtain reparations. Support all democratic and peace-loving forces in Germany. (4) Immediately cease fire in Vietnam and respect the constitution at home and in our overseas territories. (5) Raise wages and implement an automatic wage adjustment system. Provide immediate wage advances before these measures are implemented. Adopt a collective contract system with guaranteed wages; meet the legitimate demands of veterans, former prisoners of war, the unemployed, victims of natural disasters, and elderly workers. Protect our industry from the encroachment and threat of American imperialism. (6) Implement a policy based on stable and profitable prices, protecting our basic agricultural products from competition from American and other major exporters, and modernizing French agriculture. (7) Restore normal trade relations with Central and Eastern European countries. (8) Prohibit further devaluation of the Franc without prior parliamentary decision. Strictly balance the budget and substantially reduce military spending. Implement democratic tax reforms, with the tax system primarily increasing the burden on large industries and banks, and reducing the tax burden on the working people and middle-income groups. (9) Consolidate democratic achievements, especially the social insurance system threatened by domestic and American capitalists. (10) Protect the freedoms stipulated by the laws and constitution of the Republic (the right to strike, freedom of belief, speech, assembly, association, and demonstration). Abolish the de Gaulle law of August 14, 1945, which allows for the arbitrary deprivation of citizens' rights. Completely halt all actions that violate the Republic's constitution by persecuting Communist members of parliament. Dissolve the various paramilitary organizations established by the French People's Rally for the purpose of initiating civil war. (11) Review the court's verdicts acquitting traitors. Release former resistance movement participants, strike participants, and peace demonstration participants who have been illegally detained and prosecuted in court, and restore their positions. Thorez stated upon leaving the Presidential Palace: "We have told the President that to restore France, nothing can be accomplished without the working class and the Communist Party."

    法国须改变反动政策才能避免崩溃没有工人及其政党参加将一事无成
    【新华社北京十日电】塔斯社巴黎讯：在法国各民主团体要求成立民主统一政府声中，法国共产党总书记多列士于六日与法总统阿里奥尔会晤后对记者发表声明如下：我们已告诉总统单是更换一个政府是不够的，应有改变整个政策的必要。迄今所执行的政策已证明是完全错误的。我们并提出我们认为要避免国家崩溃就必须实行的基本政策原则如下：（一）摈弃马歇尔计划、大西洋公约及一切与它们有关的协定。法国积极参加一切在尊重盟国间的协定和联合国宪章基础上建立公正、民主与持久之和平的事业，批准保证法国之和平与安全的法苏同盟。（二）为禁止原子武器及缔结法苏美英中五国和平公约而斗争。（三）履行关于肃清纳粹和肃清德国军国主义的波茨坦协定，废除各种规定建立西德政府的协定。遵循这样的对德政策会符合我们的安全利益。保留取得赔偿的权利。支持德国的一切民主与爱好和平的力量。（四）立即在越南停战，在国内和我们海外属地上尊重宪法。（五）提高工资，实行自动调整工资制。在这些措施实现以前立即预付工资。采用集体合同制，有保证的工资；满足退伍军人、前战俘、失业者、遭天灾的死难者及老年工人等的正当要求。保护我们的工业免受美帝国主义的侵害和威胁。（六）实施在保护我们的基本农产品免受美国及其他国家大出口商之竞争的前提下，以稳定的和有利可图的价格为基础的政策，使法国农业现代化。（七）恢复和中欧及东欧各国正常贸易关系。（八）禁止不经过议会的先行决定而再贬低法朗价格。严格平衡预算，大量裁减军费。实行民主改革税制，税制应首先加重大工业、银公司负担，减轻劳动人民和中等收入阶层的纳税负担。（九）巩固民主成就，特别是受到本国和美国大资本家威胁的社会保险制度。（十）保护共和国法律和宪法上规定的自由（罢工的权利、信仰、言论集会、结社和游行的自由）。取消一九四五年八月十四日容许武断地剥夺公民权利的戴高乐法。完全停止一切迫害共产党议员的违犯共和国宪法的行动。解散法国人民联盟为进行内战而建立的各种半军事组织。（十一）复审法院无罪开释卖国贼的判决。释放被非法拘禁并在法庭上受到控诉的前抵抗运动的参加者、罢工和保卫和平示威的参加者，并恢复他们的职位。多列士在离开总统府时声称：“我们已告诉总统要恢复法国，少了工人阶级与共产党将一事无成”。
