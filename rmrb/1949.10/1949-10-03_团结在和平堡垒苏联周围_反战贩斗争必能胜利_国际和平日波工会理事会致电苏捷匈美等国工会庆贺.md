　　Unite Around the Peace Fortress of the Soviet Union
  　The Struggle Against Warmongers Will Surely Be Victorious
    Polish Trade Union Council Sends Telegrams to Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, the United States and Other Countries' Trade Unions to Celebrate International Peace Day
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 2nd] Warsaw dispatch from Polish News Agency: The Polish Trade Union Central Council sent congratulatory telegrams to the trade union federations of the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania on October 2nd, International Day of Struggle for Peace. The telegram to the Soviet Trade Union Central Council stated: On the International Day of Struggle for Peace, we extend fraternal congratulations to you on behalf of three and a half million trade union members. In response to the conspiracies of the Anglo-American warmongers and their lackeys, the Titoites, the Polish working class is mobilizing its strength to complete the Three-Year Plan ahead of schedule. The trade union membership will further strengthen fraternal friendship and ties with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, and will safeguard the unity and international solidarity of the working class and its professional organization - the World Federation of Trade Unions. United around the Soviet Union, the world's fortress of peace under the leadership of Comrade Stalin, the leader of the international proletariat, we will win victory in the struggle for peace.
    Because the American CIO and AFL Progressive representatives conference is scheduled to be held in Chicago on October 1st and 2nd, the Polish Trade Union Central Council sent a congratulatory telegram to the American trade union members, stating: The hysterical clamor of the warmongers will not drown out the voice of the American working class. We believe that your congress will resolutely respond to those who are eager to plunge the world into a new abyss of war for the selfish interests of a small group of financial magnates, and your congress will also resolutely respond to those who are destroying the international unity and solidarity of the working class in order to ingratiate themselves with their imperialist masters. In the great struggle for peace, the American trade unions bear a major responsibility. We believe that they will gloriously accomplish this task.

    国际和平日波工会理事会致电苏捷匈美等国工会庆贺
    【新华社北京二日电】波兰通讯社华沙讯：波兰工会中央理事会于十月二日国际和平斗争日致电苏、捷、匈、罗、保、阿尔巴尼亚各工会联合会庆贺。致苏联工会中央理事会贺电称：在国际和平斗争日，我们谨代表三百五十万工会会员向你们致兄弟的祝贺。为了回答英美战争贩子及其奴仆铁托分子的阴谋，波兰工人阶级把自己的力量动员起来以先期完成三年计划。工会的会员群众将更加加强与苏联及人民民主国家的兄弟之谊与友好联系，并将维护工人阶级及其职业组织——世界工联会的统一与国际团结。团结在世界和平堡垒——国际无产阶级领袖斯大林同志领导下的苏联的周围，我们将在争取和平的斗争中赢得胜利。
    因为美国产联与劳联进步派代表会议订于十月一、二日在芝加哥举行，波工会中央理事会电美国工会会员致贺称：战争贩子的歇斯底里的叫嚣将湮没不了美国工人阶级底声音。我们相信：你们的代表大会将果断地回答那些为一小撮财阀的自私利益而亟欲把世界投入新战争深渊去的人们，你们的代表大会也将果断地回答那些为取宠于帝国主义主子而破坏工人阶级的国际统一与团结的人们。在争取和平的伟大斗争中，美国工会担负着重大的任务。我们相信：它们将光荣地完成这一任务。
