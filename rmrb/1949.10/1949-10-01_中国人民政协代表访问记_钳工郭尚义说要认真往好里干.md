    Fitter Guo Shangyi Says He Will Work Hard and Do a Good Job

    Guo Shangyi is a fitter at the Tianjin Zhongfang Machinery Factory, a worker for twenty-one years, who has traveled through half of China. He started at the aircraft factory of the Taiyuan Arsenal in Shanxi, and then went to the Tongpu Railway Bureau. After the "July 7th" Incident, he retreated with the Railway Bureau to Xi'an, and then transferred to Hankou, working at the Aviation Main Station. After retreating to Hunan, he continued to manage the Aviation Station warehouse materials. In the autumn of 1939, he went to the Nantong Coal Mine. Workers could endure the difficulties in life for the sake of resisting Japan, but Lao Guo couldn't stand the reactionary clique's brutal oppression, imprisonment, beatings, and scoldings. He returned to Chongqing to make a living, changing five or six factories, but he couldn't stay long because of the excessive oppression. He entered the Wuhan University Experimental Factory in Leshan, where he managed to scrape by for two years, but was eventually forced to leave due to the foreman's oppression. Relying on his skills, he found the Sichuan Machinery Factory. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Lao Guo followed the factory to Shanghai and Nanjing, spending a considerable amount of time before finally arriving in Tianjin and joining the Zhongfang Machinery Factory. He had run around for half his life but never found a place that was home for workers. He understood that no matter how many places he ran to, no matter how many factories he changed, it was all in vain. Workers would suffer no matter where they went in the country. He decided not to run around anymore. From then on, he actively participated in the workers' struggle. To stand up, he had to rely on the revolution. Thus, in the Zhongfang Machinery Factory, Lao Guo became one of the leading figures trusted by the workers.

    At the end of last year, Lao Guo heard that the People's Liberation Army was about to enter Tianjin, and that the Communist Party was calling on workers in the areas to be liberated to organize factory protection teams. He felt that the days of standing up were coming. He secretly organized a factory protection team in the factory, becoming the backbone of the publicly established factory protection team. When the battle to liberate Tianjin was intense, shells fell near the factory buildings and dormitories, but Lao Guo and the factory protection team never left the factory, ensuring that the factory was completely preserved and quickly put back into operation.

    "This time, it's completely different! The Communist Party has come, trade unions have been organized, and employee representative conferences have been established. They also give us workers training classes in one or two phases, allowing us workers to participate in the management of the factory. When we were first liberated, some workers didn't have a clear understanding, but after several months of education, everyone believed that the factory was their own home, and everyone's enthusiasm for production became greater and greater. After June, the administration would discuss production plans with the workers, and everyone became more enthusiastic, challenging each other to competitions, and the output increased month by month. During the Kuomintang rule, fine yarn spindles had been tried many times, but they had never been formally produced. Now, after everyone in the factory studied it, they have overcome the difficulties and are producing them in large quantities. Fine yarn spindles produced only 500 pieces in June, but by August, the monthly output was 1,000 pieces. There are many difficulties in the manufacturing process. The sharp ends must not differ by more than one ten-thousandth of a centimeter and must have a elasticity of forty degrees. When we first succeeded in the experiment, after the part was machined and polished, once it was tempered, it was either too soft or lost its elasticity, and at least half of them were scrapped. The workers and technicians learned from failures, improved the tempering technology, and now, when producing one hundred pieces, only one or two are scrapped. The output of rollers has increased by 50 percent. Furthermore, regarding the production of steel heddles, after the research of two workers, Huang Jialu and Liu Yupu, the tools were improved. In the past, they were hand-cranked, but now they can use electricity, which has increased productivity. It used to take 2.4 work hours to make a steel heddle, but gradually reduced to 1.6, 1.4, 1.22, and finally to only 0.62 work hours."

    Guo Shangyi said excitedly: "Our working class has stood up and become the masters of the factory. The affairs of the country are our own affairs, and we have become the masters of the factory. The work of the factory is our own work, so how can we not work hard and do a good job. If we let every worker know the details of this People's Political Consultative Conference, production will be even better in the future. Don't think that we were slaves in the old society and never managed a factory or the major affairs of the country. Today, we are asked to shoulder such a great responsibility, but we workers are not afraid. We have the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao; and the Soviet Union is ahead, as our teacher. Then again, in the old society, once you became a worker, that was the end of it, and there was no use in learning anything. Now, workers have become the leading class, so we really have to study hard, study Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, learn to manage factories, learn culture, learn technology, and we must first enrich ourselves."

　　中国人民政协代表访问记
    钳工郭尚义说要认真往好里干
    郭尚义，是天津中纺机械厂的钳工，做了二十一年的工人，走过了半个中国。开头是在山西太原兵工厂的飞机厂，以后就到了同蒲铁路局。“七七”抗战以后，随路局退到西安，转往汉口，在航空总站做工。撤到湖南之后，仍是管理航空站库房材料，三九年秋天入川，下了南桐煤矿，工人为抗战，生活上的难处，怎么也能受下去，但是对反动派野蛮的压迫，关禁闭，打骂，老郭受不了，回到重庆谋生，换了五六个厂子，也都因为压迫太甚，没留住长。进了乐山的武汉大学实验工厂，算是混了两年，终因工头的压迫，又被迫离开。凭着他的技术，又找到了四川机器厂。抗战胜利之后，老郭随着厂子到了上海、南京，混了好些时光，最后才到了天津，投入中纺机械厂。他跑了半辈子，也没找到一处是工人的家，他懂得了，地方跑得再多，厂子换得再多，也是白费，工人走遍全国还是一样受苦受罪，他决心不再跑了，从此，积极参加了工人的斗争，要翻身就得靠革命，这样，在中纺机械厂里，老郭成为工人信服的带头人之一。
    去年年底，老郭听说解放军快进天津了，又听说共产党号召待解放区的工人们，组织护厂队，他感觉翻身的日子来了。在厂里就先秘密组织护厂队，成为后来全厂公开成立的护厂队的骨干。解放天津战斗紧张的时候，炮弹落到厂房和宿舍附近，老郭和护厂队，始终没有离开厂子一步，使工厂完整的保存下来，迅速开工。
    “这回，可大不一样啦！共产党来了，工会组织起来了，也成立了职工代表会议，又给咱们工人一期两期的办训练班，让咱们工人参加管理工厂。刚解放的时候，还有的工友认识不清，经过几个月的教育，大伙都相信了工厂就是自己的家，大伙生产的劲头，越来越大。六月份以后，行政上订生产计划，找工人商量，大伙更加心盛，挑战竞赛，产量一个月比一个月提高。国民党统治的时候，细纱锭子，试做过多少回，总没能正式出品。现在经过全厂大家研究，已经克服了困难，大量生产，细纱锭六月份生产只五百枚，到八月份已能月产一千枚。制造过程中，困难很多，两端的尖头，不能差千分之一糎，还要有四十度的弹力。刚开始试验成功的时候，车好了，磨好了，一到沾火，不是软，就是没了弹性，报废的至少一半。工友和技术员们，从失败中找经验，改进了沾火的技术，现在出产一百根，报废的不过一根两根。出产罗拉的产量，增加了百分之五十，再说制钢筘，经过黄家禄、刘玉镤两个工友的研究，把工具改良了，过去是手摇的，现在能用电力，提高了生产率，做一个钢筘，以前得二·四个工，逐渐减下来了，减到一·六，一·四，一·二二，一直减到只需○·六二个工。”
    郭尚义兴奋的说：“咱们工人阶级翻身了，已成了工厂的主人，国家的事，就是咱们自己的事，咱也成了工厂的主人，工厂的活，就是我们自己的活，那还能不认真往好里干哪。要是把这一次人民政协会议的细情，再让每个工友知道，往后，生产更能搞好。不要看我们在旧社会里当奴隶，没有管理过工厂，没有管理过国家大事，今天把这样大的责任叫我们担当，我们工人是不怕的，咱们有共产党和毛主席的领导；还有苏联走在前面，是咱们的老师。话又说回来，在旧社会里，一当工人就算完了，学习什么也没用，现在，工人成了领导阶级，当真得好好学习，学习马列主义毛泽东思想，学习管理工厂，学习文化，学习技术，一定得把自己先充实起来。”
