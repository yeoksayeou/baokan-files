Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 10th: TASS, Berlin—On October 7th, after the German Socialist Unity Party Chairman Wilhelm Pieck delivered a speech following the unanimous adoption of the declaration by the German People's Council, he spoke on the second item on the agenda—an assessment of the political situation and the necessary measures to be taken.

	The Current Lofty National Task of the People's Parliament is to Establish the Provisional Government of the German Democratic Republic

Pieck pointed out that among the previous meetings of the German People's Council since its establishment in March 1948, this meeting holds particularly great importance for the lives of the German people and their future. No matter how strange it may sound, in order to carry out the tasks before it, the People's Council must dissolve and re-establish itself as the Provisional People's Parliament of the German Democratic Republic, in order to transition to a higher form of struggle for unification and a just peace. (Applause) The current lofty national task of this People's Parliament is to establish the provisional government of the German Democratic Republic. (Applause)

The legitimacy of this event is based on the fact that the current organizational composition of the People's Council is the result of the election of the Third German People's Congress on May 30th of this year, and this Congress was produced by universal suffrage of the German people on May 15th and 16th of this year. Nevertheless, with the establishment of the People's Parliament and the provisional government, this temporary institution will end its existence after the election of the People's Parliament, county councils, and township governments. As a result of the unanimous agreement of the Presidium and the committees, these elections are scheduled to be held on October 15, 1950. (Applause)

	Western Occupying Powers Establish West German State as Tool for Imperialist Aggression

Due to the measures taken by the Western occupying powers, a very difficult situation has arisen for the German people. The national disasterous situation has become so serious that it is a blow to the national survival of the German people, and it has developed to the point of being severing Germany and setting up a separate West German state. The Western occupying powers established the West German state as a tool for realizing their imperialist plans. What the German people are most pained and regretful about is that the politicians in West Germany have agreed to commit such a crime against the German people. The solution to the German people's problems depends on achieving peace; the attainment of peace will guarantee the freedom and independence of the German people and create conditions for them to manage their own affairs. We are faced with the sad fact that the promises made to the German people by the Allied occupying powers in the Potsdam Agreement—allowing German economic unification, allowing the German people to establish their own central organs, and finally, through the cooperation of various forces, implementing the eradication of militarism and democratization in Germany, establishing a genuine democratic system in Germany that will guarantee to the people of all countries that they will no longer be attacked by Germany, and ensuring that Germany will participate in the ranks of the powerful peace camp headed by the great Soviet Union—have not been realized. The Western occupying powers believe that they can casually violate this agreement and take unilateral measures to subject a part of Germany to the direct control of these Western countries, such as implementing occupation regulations.

However, this not only infringes upon and cancels the national freedom of the West German people, but also primarily causes economic difficulties for the German people. The purpose of all economic measures in West Germany is to destroy the ties between East and West Germany.

Yes, the fact before us is that the Western occupying authorities have issued direct orders to prevent the restoration of economic ties between East and West Germany.
	The Destruction by the US and Britain of the Restoration of Economic Ties Between East and West Germany Seriously Endangers the Economic Status of the Laboring Masses

It is very clear that as a result of all these measures by the West, the economic status of the laboring masses is particularly restricted and in extremely great danger. However, not only the laboring masses, but also shopkeepers, small handicraftsmen, and representatives of the intelligentsia cannot escape—they are all victims of the fatal economic policies of the Western occupying powers. This is particularly due to American imperialism, which implements its measures in the most brutal way, measures whose goal is to crush all competition from Germany and expand the economic domination of American monopoly capital in Germany. Thus, all the above-mentioned measures greatly contribute to strengthening the view that it is impossible to guarantee the economic survival of the German people in this way; on the contrary, this measure threatens the national survival of the German people, and this increasing view is the origin of the increasing resistance to this policy mentioned in the National Front declaration we just passed. Yes, that is the case, if these forces of the German people do not unite, then the future of our people is bleak.

The Western occupying powers are doing everything possible to deceive the German people, lead them astray, and not only that, but also cultivate conditions for them to be used as cannon fodder again, and all of this is supported by the West German politicians. All of this forces the people in West Germany to seriously review the consequences of this policy and to crush the attempts of American imperialism to strangle the German economy with the united resistance of workers and employers. This is not only a threat to the economic and national survival of the German people, but also a fatal plan—to create the possibility for imperialist countries to expand their rule over Europe with a new war. Indeed, imperialist countries are preparing for new wars by all means; they are not only using measures said to be for helping and restoring the German people, such as the Marshall Plan, but also taking measures to pull West Germany—the separate West German state—into military pacts, the purpose of which is to organize military alliances against the East, against East Germany, against people's democratic countries, and against the Soviet Union.

	Imperialist Countries Are Preparing New Wars, Attempting to Mislead the German People and Use Them as Cannon Fodder

The constant and despicable slanders against the East are aimed at leading the German people astray and making them serve as cannon fodder in wars prepared for such purposes. The measures taken by American imperialists, the arrival of the American Chiefs of Staff in Europe and Germany, reveal their plans to consolidate their base there, where the line of defense for a new war must be established. The purpose of supplying munitions is solely to prepare to throw the people into war. To sum up, it is necessary to make every effort to make the people recognize the dangers that threaten them and to establish a solid front to struggle against American imperialist military plans. Thus, an extremely threatening situation has arisen, a situation that has been exacerbated by the recent establishment of a separate West German state and the Bonn Parliament (Federal Parliament); the purpose of these measures is to conceal the disastrous situation of the German people and the atrocities committed by the West German authorities. The elections of the Federal Parliament were undemocratic, conducted in a violent atmosphere of terror against the German Communist Party, and a deception aimed at making it seem that the issue was simply about establishing a free and independent parliament and a democratically free government through elections.

	Establish a Government Representing the Interests of the German People So That It Can Guarantee People's Livelihood and Realize Democracy

The facts show how the German people have been deceived. In voting, based on promises and as a result of various measures, they hoped that living conditions would improve, and above all that the German people would gain greater influence in administration and government. All of this has proven to be false. The governors of the Western countries threaten the German people with very brutal means and restrict the powers that should be given to the Federal Parliament and the government in all aspects. The German people have a great responsibility to draw the right conclusions from this situation. Understanding this, recognizing the importance of the position of the German people, the movement of the German People's Congress has arisen, the goal of which is to create preconditions for the German people to achieve unification and a just peace treaty. The German People's Congress movement has achieved a broad scale and has mobilized various forces in West Germany that recognize the serious situation and are prepared to advance shoulder to shoulder with the democratic and peace-loving forces of East Germany. The German People's Council has accepted and realized the great task of mobilizing various forces, conducting education work, and establishing a battle line to achieve the established goals.

Now, it is necessary to take actions that go even further than these measures, and to establish here—in East Germany—an institution that must represent the German people, realize democratic tasks, and transform the economy so that it can guarantee the people's livelihood, first of all paying attention to ensuring that the reputation of the Germans, which was tainted by the Hitler government and its wars, regains the trust of the people of other nations. This must be done by the People's Council, establishing a government that can represent the true national, economic, political, and cultural interests of the German people. (Long period of applause and cheers)

	The Soviet Union Supports German Unification and Maintaining Peace, While Western Occupiers Prevent the Conclusion of a Peace Treaty with Germany

The People's Council decided to proactively reorganize itself into the Provisional People's Parliament of the German Democratic Republic because of the unprecedented unfortunate situation of our people. In our region, we need a government that can do everything possible to ensure that the German people obtain freedom. This is why we express our warm welcome to the support given by the Soviet government and the Soviet occupation authorities in Germany to overcome the unfortunate situation of the people (thunderous applause). The Western occupying authorities are doing everything possible to deprive the German people of their rights, destroy their economy, and drag them into a new war, but since the end of the war, the Soviet government has consistently put forward consistent demands that are favorable to guaranteeing the cause of peace in Europe and favorable to the national and economic interests of the German people at the Potsdam Conference and the subsequent Warsaw Conference. The Soviet Union's great achievement lies in the fact that the idea of establishing a unified Germany and maintaining peace has been accepted by more and more people around the world. At the Foreign Ministers' Conference, the Soviet representative very clearly revealed the conditions for concluding a peace treaty with Germany, and they had used various methods to give the German people the opportunity to build a democratic and free Germany with their own strength. Contrary to these wishes, the Western occupying authorities are doing everything possible to obstruct the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. At the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference, the demand for the conclusion of a peace treaty was raised again. However, the Western occupying authorities made it clear that "generally speaking, we do not intend to talk about a peace treaty with Germany." They said clearly and unequivocally that "what is important to them is to allow the occupying forces to remain stationed in Germany for many years and to deprive the German people of various opportunities for democratic development."

Thus, the German people must understand, and they do understand, what this means for their future. The occupation regulations of the American and British imperialists have clearly and unequivocally stipulated that the German people must not decide their living conditions through their own parliament or government, and that they must depend on the imperialist interests of the Western countries in all aspects. The task facing the German people is very clear. The sections stated in the People's Council's declaration on the National Front are the foundation for the great struggle that the German people must carry out with one heart and one mind. We have set an example in East Germany for the cooperation of all democratic forces. The joint work of the Socialist Unity Party, the Christian Democratic Union, the Free Democratic Party, the National Democratic Party, and the Democratic Peasants' Party in the alliance and the People's Council has shown the German people that despite differences in political and other opinions, the national interests of the entire Germany must be placed at the center, and all selfish party interests must be set aside. (Long period of applause)

The strength of our movement in East Germany lies in this, that is, in the concerted efforts of various political parties, trade unions, and mass organizations, which, in contrast to the disputes and quarrels in the West German Federal Government, jointly decide all issues to help the German people get rid of national disasters. What will be decided in the Federal Council and the People's Parliament is the basis for consolidating the solidarity of action in the German people's struggle for national interests. We express a justified hope that if the People's Parliament to be established in the future requests the Soviet government to grant sovereignty to the German people so that they can independently solve economic problems and overcome difficulties—this will not only strengthen the strength of the German people and the struggle against warmongers, but also help the establishment of peace in Europe, then the People's Parliament will receive full support from the Soviet government for its request to grant sovereignty to the German democratic government that is being established. (Loud cheers)

	The Soviet Union Will Fully Support the People's Parliament in Handing Over Sovereignty to the German Democratic Government

The Provisional People's Parliament faces enormous tasks. This explains why it must fully and clearly depict the work of the People's Parliament and the establishment of the government. Needless to say, we will take the interests of West Germany into consideration when implementing our policies in the future, and we will implement this policy together with the progressive forces of West Germany. Our policy will aim to seek mutual understanding with the people of West Germany so that it is closer to our policies and the various measures that the People's Parliament and the government will adopt. The German People's Council, which is responsible for carrying out this arduous preliminary work, has undertaken the honorable task of explaining this situation. At recent meetings, it has repeatedly issued appeals to the people of West Germany. We have appealed to the various parties in West Germany to hold joint meetings with us to jointly decide what should be done regarding the plans of the Western occupying countries to ensure the unity and peace of Germany. These efforts of the People's Council have not yielded any results so far. The politicians in West Germany underestimate the serious dangers that threaten the German people and do not understand that their task is to prevent the division of Germany with us, and first of all to establish the foundation of economic life for the German people.

Therefore, the task of the People's Council lies in unanimously guaranteeing the resolutions we take today and unanimously completing the activities of the People's Council and then starting the work of the Provisional People's Parliament of the German Democratic Republic. I think we don't need to say much to understand this task, and we will be able to guarantee the maximum success for the tasks facing the People's Parliament that is currently being established.

We must gain trust and mutual understanding with those people who advocate world peace on a democratic basis and struggle against imperialist efforts. We are pleased to see that our eastern neighbors possess such strength, and based on the international situation and national tasks, they have transitioned to the establishment of a people's democratic regime, which to a great extent aims at cooperation, mutual assistance, and first of all, guaranteeing peace. We salute all the forces in the people's democratic countries that have already cooperated closely with us. We first salute the Soviet people, who, with the help of their government, are realizing this development and are making every effort to maintain peace throughout the world (stormy and lasting applause).

	The Established Border of the Oder and Neisse Rivers Is a Peaceful Border Between the German and Polish Peoples

We must solve some huge and important tasks, one of which is to establish economic relations. If the enemies of peace and warmongers use the border issue of the Oder and Neisse Rivers to create discord and incite war psychology among the German people, then we clearly declare that we believe that the established border of the Oder and Neisse Rivers, which was caused by the war and the results of the end of the war, is not a border that can be used to provoke hostility and war, but a peaceful border between the German and Polish peoples. (Stormy applause)

Everything that the enemies of democracy and peace say about this issue is nothing more than wanting to use the unfortunate people who have suffered from the war and the people who have moved out of their homes due to the demarcation of this border as cannon fodder. We respect these people with great sympathy, and we regard helping them solve their difficulties, giving them work, giving them land, and giving them opportunities to make a living as one of our tasks to compensate for the losses caused by the Hitler war.

The situation in West Germany is completely different. There, there is no expression of care for the families of immigrants, they are not given land, nor are they given work. There, the only consolation they get is some empty talk about how they can regain their homes if a new war breaks out. We understand what a new war means for Germany, especially for those immigrants who can hardly keep even the little things they still had after the Hitler war.

	The Crimes of American Imperialism in Brutalizing the German People Must Never Be Forgiven

At the moment when the Americans are using this border to conduct anti-peace propaganda, the Germans must not forget what kind of brutality the American government used to participate in destroying Germany. At a time when the outcome of the war was already determined, the German towns and enterprises were still destroyed so cruelly, which can only show that they wanted to take away any possibility of rebirth for the Germans. Such actions of the Americans must never be forgiven. However, it is very regrettable that the Western politicians' mad slander and defamation of the East have drowned out these facts.

Now, we have a great task before us—to continue the cause started by the German People's Congress, because the end of the People's Council does not cancel the democratic movement of the People's Congress. On the contrary, we must do everything possible to make the movement of the People's Congress accepted and gain people's support, especially in West Germany.

We should not care about conflicts of interest, and we should unite the people of all strata in West Germany—from workers to employers and those who followed Hitler when Hitler was in power, who were drawn into Hitler's organization and participated in the fatal Hitler war—as widely as possible in the unified front to defend the national interests of our people. We must make them participate in the joint recovery work. We only put forward one condition to them: they must completely abandon fascist ideas and accept democratic and peaceful ideas.

	Unite People of All Strata in West Germany to Participate in Joint Recovery Work

Therefore, those forces that have been participating in the People's Congress movement on a large scale until now must also support the activities of the Provisional People's Parliament and the Provisional People's Government with their efforts.

On the day when the activities of the People's Council come to an end, we call on the people in the same name and with the same trust in the work of the People's Parliament and the People's Government as they trusted the People's Council before. We firmly believe that the work carried out by the People's Council has not been in vain. Participating in this work is a decisive task for all forces that support the establishment of relations between East and West. For these forces, the main purpose of establishing relations between East and West is to consolidate the forces of democracy, economic recovery, and peace.

We hope to establish the closest cooperation with the people of West Germany. I hope that the measures formulated today due to the establishment of the Provisional People's Parliament will achieve the victory of the cause that our People's Council has fought for, namely the unification of Germany, democracy, peace, and a happier future for the German people. (Stormy and lasting applause)

　　在德国人民委员会会议上
    皮克作政治报告
    号召建立全德政府
    【新华社北京十日电】塔斯社柏林讯：十月七日，德国统一社会党主席威廉·皮克在德国人民委员会会议全体一致通过宣言之后，就议程第二项——政治形势的估计与采取必要的措施——发表演说。
　　　　人民议会当前的崇高民族任务是成立德人民共和国临时政府
    皮克指出，德国人民委员会自从一九四八年三月成立以来，在其历次的会议中，这次会议对于德国人民的生活和他们的将来具有格外伟大的重要性。不管听起来怎样奇怪，人民委员会为了要执行摆在面前的任务，就必须解散并重新建立成为德意志民主共和国临时人民议会，以便过渡到争取统一与公正和平的斗争的更高形式。（鼓掌）这个人民议会当前的崇高的民族任务，是成立德意志人民共和国临时政府。（鼓掌）
    这一事件的合法性，以下一事实为其根据，这事实就是：目前，人民委员会的组织成分，是本年五月三十日第三届德国人民代表大会选举的结果，而这次代表大会，又是德国人民在本年五月十五、十六两日由普选产生的。虽然如此，随着人民议会和临时政府的成立，这一临时机构将在选举人民议会、各郡议会和各乡市政府之后结束其存在。由于主席团及委员会全体一致协议的结果，这些选举已定于一九五○年十月十五日举行。（鼓掌）
    　　　　西方占领国家成立西德国家作为实现帝国主义侵略工具
    由于西方占领国家所采取的措施，已发生了对于德国人民非常困难的局势。民族灾难性的形势，已经严重到成为对德国人民民族生存的一个打击，而且由于分裂德国，割据德国的一部分组成分立的西德国家的缘故而发展到登峰造极的程度。西方占领国家成立西德国家，作为实现其帝国主义计划的工具。德国人民所最为痛苦与遗憾的，是西德的政客们竟同意犯这种对德国人民的罪行。德国人民的问题的解决，有赖于取得和平；和平之达到，将保证德国人民的自由和独立，并创造他们能以自行管理自己事务的条件。我们遭逢这一可悲的事实，即各占领盟国在波茨坦协定中所答应给德国人民的诺言：允许德国经济统一，允许德国人民成立自己的中央机关，以及最后，经过各种力量的合作在德国实行肃清军国主义和民主化，在德国建立真正的、将向各国人民保证他们不再受德国的进攻，保证德国将参加以伟大苏联为首的强大和平阵营的行列的民主制度，都没有实现。西方占领国家认为可以随便破坏这一协定，采取片面措施，使德国的一部分听由这些西方国家直接支配，如实行占领法规之类。
    然而，这不仅侵犯和取消西德人民的民族自由，而且首先是给德国人民造成经济困难。西德一切经济措施的目的均为摧毁东西德之间的联系。
    是的，我们面前的事实，就是西方占领当局发出了直接的命令，阻止东西德之间经济联系的恢复。 　　美英破坏东西德经济联系的恢复严重地危害劳动群众的经济地位
    十分明显地，由于西方这一切措施的结果，劳动群众的经济地位特别受到限制，而处于异常巨大的危险中。但是，不仅劳动群众如此，即店主，小手工业者及知识分子的代表，亦不能逃免——他们全都是西方占领国家的致命的经济政策的牺牲者。这特别是由于美国帝国主义，它以最粗暴的方法，实行它的措施，这些措施的目标，是击碎一切出自德国方面的竞争，并扩展美国独占资本在德国的经济统治。这样，上述的一切措施，均大大有助于加强一种看法，即：这样是不可能保证德国人民的经济生存的；相反地，这种措施威胁着德国人民的民族生存，这种日益增长的看法，是我们刚刚通过的全国阵线宣言内所谈及的对这个政策日益增强的反抗的来由。是的，事情是这样，如果德国人民的这些力量不联合起来，那么，我们的人民的前途是黯淡的。
    西方占领国家正竭尽一切方法欺骗德国人民，将他们引入歧途，不仅如此，还要培养使他们再度被利用作为炮灰的条件，而这一切，都获得西德政客们的支持。所有这些，均使得西德的人民不得不认真地检讨这种政策的结果，而以工人及雇主的联合抵抗，来粉碎美国帝国主义扼杀德国经济的企图。这不仅是对德国人民的经济及民族生存的威胁，而且也是一个致命的计划——以新战争来造成帝国主义国家扩展它们对欧洲的统治的可能性。的确，帝国主义国家正在用一切手段准备新战争，它们不仅使用说是为帮助及恢复德国人民的措施，例如马歇尔计划之类，并更采取将西德——分立的西德国家拉入军事公约的措施，该公约的目的是组织反对东方、反对东德、反对人民民主国家和反对苏联的军事联盟。
　　　　帝国主义国家正在准备新战争妄图将德人民引入歧途当炮灰
    对东方的经常和可鄙的诽谤，旨在将德国人民引入歧途，并使他们充当准备为用于这样的战争中的炮灰。美帝国主义者所采取的措施，美国参谋长之抵达欧洲及德国，均显露了他们在那里巩固自己的地盘的计划，新战争的防线将必须在那里建立。供给军火的建议的目的，仅在准备将人民投进战争。综上所述，就有必要尽一切的努力，以使人民认清威胁他们的危险，并建立巩固的反美帝国主义军事计划斗争的战线。这样，极具威胁性的情势发生了，这一形势因最近分立的西德国家及波恩议会（联邦议会）的成立而严重化，这些措施的目的，在于隐瞒德国人民灾难的情况以及西德当局所犯的暴行。联邦议会的选举是不民主的，它是在一种反对德国共产党的强暴的恐怖气氛中进行的，而且是一个欺骗，旨在把事情说成为似乎问题只是在于通过选举而建立自由独立的国会和民主自由的政府。
    　　建立代表德国人民利益的政府使之保障人民生活与实现民主
    事实显示了德国人民是怎样地被骗。在投票时，根据诺言以及作为各种措施的结果，他们希望生活状况将能改善，而首先是德国人民在行政上及政府内能得到更大的影响。这一切，都被证明是虚伪的。西方国家的总督，以非常残暴的手段威胁德国人民，而在一切方面限制应给予联邦议会及政府的权力。德国人民有着很大的责任从这种情况中得出正确的结论。明白了这些，认清了德国人民的地位的重要，因而发生了德国人民代表大会的运动，它本身的目标，是为德国人民达成统一及公正的和平条约创造先决条件。德国人民代表大会运动，已具有广泛的规模，且已在西德动员了各种认清严重情况、及准备与东德的民主与爱好和平力量并肩前进的力量。德国人民委员会接受了而且实现了动员各种力量、进行教育工作及建立实现既定目标的斗争战线这个伟大的任务。
    现在，已有必要采取比这些措施更进一步的行动，并在这里——东德设立一个这样的机构，它必须代表德国人民，实现民主的任务，转化经济，使之能够保障人民的生活，首先注意使那为希特勒政府及其所进行的战争所玷污了的德国人的声誉，重新取得其他民族人民的信任。这必须由人民委员会来作，建立一个能代表德国人民的真正的民族、经济、政治与文化利益的政府。（长时期的鼓掌欢呼）
　　　　苏联支持德国统一与维持和平西方占领者阻止缔结对德和约
    人民委员会之所以要决定主动地把自己改组成为德意志民主共和国临时人民议会，系由于我国人民空前不幸的处境。在我们的地区，我们需要一个能竭尽一切以确保德国人民获得自由的政府。这就是我们何以对苏联政府及德境苏联占领当局为克服人民不幸之处境而给予的支持表示热烈欢迎的理由（雷动的掌声）。西方占领当局正在尽一切方法剥夺德国人民的权利，摧毁他们的经济及把他们拖入新战争，但是，苏联政府却从战争结束以来，就在波茨坦会议及后来的华沙会议上始终不渝地提出有利于保证欧洲和平事业和有利于德国人民的民族与经济利益的一贯的要求。苏联的巨大功迹在于：使建立统一的德国与维持和平的这一思想，为全世界越来越多的人所接受。在外长会议上，苏联代表极清晰地揭示了缔结对德和约的条件，他们曾用种种方法使德国人民有机会以他们自己的力量去建立民主与自由的德国。与这些愿望相反，西方占领当局则竭力阻挠对德和约的缔结。在巴黎外长会议上，缔订和约的要求再次被提了出来。然而，西方占领当局却明确地说：我们一般说来，不打算谈什么对德和约。他们明确而清楚地说：对他们重要的是，让占领军许多年地留驻德国，并剥夺德国人民的民主发展的种种机会。
    这样，德国人民必须了解而且他们确实了解这对他们的将来说来是意味着什么。美英帝国主义者的占领法规，已清楚而明确地规定：德国人民不得经由其自己的议会或政府来决定其生活条件，而且，他们在各方面都要取决于西方国家的帝国主义利益。德国人民所面临的任务，是十分明白的。人民委员会在其关于全国阵线宣言中所说各节，是德国人民必须同心协力去进行的伟大斗争的基础。我们已在东德为一切民主力量的合作树立了榜样。统一社会党、基督教民主联盟、自由民主党、国家民主党与民主农民党，在同盟及人民委员会中的共同工作，已向德国人民表明：尽管在政治及其他意见上有分歧，但是，整个德国的民族利益必须摆在中心，一切自私的党派利益必须撇开。（长时间的鼓掌）
    我们在东德的运动的力量就在于此，这就是说，在于各政党、职工会及群众团体的协力一致，它们与西德联邦政府中的争执吵架相反，都是共同决定一切问题，以帮助德国人民摆脱民族灾难的。在联邦院和人民议会中所将决定的，是巩固德国人民争取民族利益的斗争中这一行动团结的基础。我们表示一种正当的希望，那就是：倘若将来成立的人民议会，要求苏联政府把主权给予德国人民，以便他们能独立地解决经济问题和克服困难——这不仅将加强德国人民的力量和反对战争贩子的斗争，而且将有助于欧洲和平的建立，那么，人民议会将获得苏联政府对它所提关于把主权给予正在建立中的德国民主政府的要求的充分支持。（高声的欢呼）
    　　　　苏联将充分支持人民议会把主权交给德国民主政府
    临时人民议会面临巨大的任务。这就说明为何它必须充分明确地对自己描绘出人民议会工作和成立政府的情况。不用说，我们将来施行我们的政策时，将顾及西德的利益，并与西德的进步力量共同执行这个政策。我们的政策将旨在与西德人民谋得相互的谅解，以使它更为接近我们的政策和人民议会及政府将予以通过的各种措施。负责进行这种艰巨的初步工作的德国人民委员会，担负了关于解释这种情况的荣誉任务。在最近几次会议上，它曾一再向西德人民发出号召。我们曾吁请西德各党派与我们举行联席会议，共同就西方占领国的计划，决定应该做些什么，以保证德国的统一与和平。人民委员会的这些努力，迄今未有任何结果。西德的政治家们，过低估计了威胁德国人民的严重危险，不了解他们的任务就是与我们一起去阻止德国的分裂，首先是为德国人民建立经济生活的基础。
    因此，人民委员会的任务，在于一致地保证今日我们所采取的决议，并一致地完成人民委员会的活动进而开始德意志民主共和国临时人民议会的工作。我想，我们用不着多说就可以了解这种任务，而且，我们将能对目前正在建立中的人民议会所面临的任务，保证最大限度的成功。
    我们必须与那些在民主基础上主张世界和平并与帝国主义努力作斗争的人民，取得信任和相互的谅解。我们满意地看到：我们东方的邻国拥有这样的力量，他们依据国际情势和国家任务，已过渡到建立人民民主政权，这种人民民主政权在巨大的程度上旨在合作、互助，而首先是保障和平。我们向人民民主国家中一切已经和我们密切合作的力量致敬。我们首先向苏联人民致敬，他们在他们政府的帮助下，正在实现这种发展，并且正在尽一切努力以维持全世界的和平（暴风雨般历久不息的掌声）。
    　　　　奥德河和尼斯河的既定边界是德波人民之间和平的边界
    我们必须解决一些巨大而且重要的任务，建立经济关系就是其中之一。如果和平的敌人和战争贩子利用奥德河和尼斯河的边界问题来在德国人民中间制造不和与煽动战争心理的话，那么，我们明白地宣告：我们认为由于战争和战争结束的结果而造成的奥德河和尼斯河的既定边界，并不是一个可以利用来挑拨敌对和战争的边界，而是一个德国与波兰人民之间和平的边界。（暴风雨似的鼓掌声）
    民主与和平的敌人，对这个问题所说的一切，无非是想利用遭受战祸的不幸的人民，利用由于划定这一边界而迁出自己的家园的人民充当炮灰。我们以十分的同情尊重这些人民，并把帮助他们解决困苦，给他们工作，给他们土地和谋生的机会，作为我们的一个任务，以补偿希特勒战争所造成的损失。
    西德的情形却完全不同，在那里，对移民的家庭没有一点关怀的表现，不给他们土地，也不给他们工作，在那里，他们得到的唯一的安慰，就是一些关于如果爆发了新战争，他们就可以重获他们的家园的空话。我们懂得新战争对于德国，特别是对于那些连在希特勒战争之后还保有的一点东西也难保有的移民有什么意义。
    　　　　美帝残害德人罪行决不能够加以宽恕
    正在美国人利用这个边界来进行反和平宣传的时刻，德国人切切不可忘记美国政府是用什么样的残暴来参与摧残德国的行为的。在战争的结果已成定局的时候，德国的城镇和企业仍被那样凶残地毁坏，这只能说明他们想夺去德国人复生的任何可能。美国人的这种行径，决不能加以宽恕。可是，非常遗憾，西方政客们对东方狂乱的诽谤和诬蔑，使得这些事实被淹没了。
    现在，在我们面前摆着伟大的任务——继续德国人民代表大会所开始了的事业，因为人民委员会的结束，并不取消人民代表大会的民主运动。相反，我们必须尽一切力量使人民代表大会的运动为人所接受，取得人们的支持，而首先是在西德。
    我们应不计较利害矛盾，应把西德各种阶层的人民——从工人到雇主以及那些在希特勒当政的时候曾经跟着希特勒走，曾经被拉进了希特勒的组织并参加了致命的希特勒战争的人们——尽可能广泛地团结在保卫我们人民的民族利益的统一战线中。我们一定要使他们参加共同的恢复工作。我们只向他们提出一个条件：他们必须完全放弃法西斯思想并接受民主和平的思想。
    　　　　团结西德各阶层人民参加共同的恢复工作
    因此，就是那些一直到现在为止都大规模参加了人民代表大会运动的力量，还必须以他们的努力来支持临时人民议会和临时人民政府的活动。
    在人民委员会的活动告结束的今天，我们以同样的名义号召人民，同样的信任人民议会和人民政府的工作，就象他们在此以前信任人民委员会一样。我们坚信人民委员会所进行的工作不是落了空的。参加这个工作，是一切支持建立东西之间关系的力量的决定性的任务。对于这些力量来说，建立东西间关系的主旨，就是巩固民主、经济复兴与和平的力量。
    我们希望与西德的人民建立最密切的合作。我希望今天由于临时人民议会的建立而制订的措施，将获致我们人民委员会曾为之奋斗的事业的胜利，即德国的统一、民主、和平与德国人民更幸福的未来。（暴风雨般历久不息的掌声）
