　　The Night of October 1st in the Capital

　　Thousands of red lanterns, thousands of torches, an organized procession of 300,000 people unfolded beneath the fluttering, sky-obscuring red flags. Tens of thousands of people surged towards the bridge in front of Tiananmen, shouting "Long live Chairman Mao, long live, long, long live!" with earth-shattering roars. On the gate tower of Tiananmen, Chairman Mao stood up and waved frequently to the cheering crowd. Suddenly, tens of thousands of colorful fireworks filled the high sky above Tiananmen Square. This was a fireworks display organized by one hundred guns. Fireworks rose from all directions towards the high sky above Tiananmen Square, from 6:30 to 7:00 PM. The capital was immersed in revelry.

　　The commander announced: The parade begins. Two long lines advanced east and west to the music of "March of the People's Liberation Army." The east-bound parade was led by workers from the clothing factory, followed closely by farmers, then cadres, students, troops... This contingent, symbolizing the great unity of the people of the whole country, had gathered in Tiananmen Square from all corners since 8:00 AM. Now, more than ten hours had passed, without lunch, without rest, but encouraged by the joy of the founding ceremony, their spirits remained high and full. Listen, as the contingent stepped out of the Three Arches, the majestic song rang out: Go! Follow Mao Zedong!

　　The parade began. From West Chang'an Street to East Chang'an Street, from Wangfujing to Wangfu Avenue, from Xidan to Xisi... the parade was blocked by cheering crowds on both sides of the street. It was impossible for two units to advance side by side. Wherever the parade went, it merged with the applause and slogans of the crowds lining the streets.

　　Among the cheering crowds on both sides of the street, there were many elderly people, some of whom had brought a chair to sit down. This became a major feature of the capital's night on October 1st. Some of them rarely go out, but, in the words of Mr. Liu, an old man in front of the Baokang Pharmacy on Dongdan Street, they wanted to see this "once-in-ten-thousand-years happy event" today.

　　At the north entrance of Wangfujing, a burst of rapid applause suddenly erupted. The band was coming, and 180 instruments played "Unity is Strength" in unison. Following the band, a young man said to his companion: "If it were the Kuomintang's band, you wouldn't even think about seeing it." His companion replied humorously: "The Kuomintang also had a band, but it wasn't much better than a tea seller's."

　　More and more people followed the band, forming a special parade. This was an unorganized contingent, but it was organized by the band. They marched alongside the band, they applauded, they cheered. Groups of children on both sides of the road, including those who had just entered elementary school, clapped their little hands and sang "The East is Red, the sun rises, China has produced a Mao Zedong" and "Unity is Strength" to the music. Indeed, it is this power of unity, under the banner of Mao Zedong, that has created infinitely bright and happy prospects for their future. This scene deeply moved a sauce garden shopkeeper, who said meaningfully: "This is truly rejoicing with the people."

　　When the parade had been leaving the venue for two and a half hours, the entire capital was already shaken by the endless cheers. However, in Tiananmen Square, there was still a long line of people stepping out of the venue in an orderly manner.

　　This is truly a "once-in-ten-thousand-years happy event." People have compared it to the scene on the day of victory in the Anti-Japanese War. However, a vendor said: "There were only a few people at that time, not even a third of this. After the Communist Party came, all walks of life were organized. How many people must there be!" In fact, the real significance is not just here. The day of victory in the Anti-Japanese War was precisely when the Kuomintang bandit gang took over. At that time, the joy caused by the victory of the Anti-Japanese War was extinguished by the bandit gang's clutches in a few days. That joy was just the beginning of suffering new disasters. However, the revelry on the night of October 1, 1949, was precisely the beginning of the great Chinese people moving towards prosperity and creating civilization and happiness for themselves. The great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out this broad road for us.

　　首都十月一日之夜
    万千红灯，万千火炬，三十万人的有组织的队伍，在蔽天的红旗招展下面展开了。数万群众，涌向天安门前的大桥，以震天的吼声狂呼“毛主席万岁，万岁，万万岁！”在天安门的门楼上，毛主席起立频频向欢呼的人群扬手致意。蓦然间，万朵彩色的礼花撒满了天安门广场的高空。这是由一百支枪组织成的礼花放射。礼花从四面八方腾向天安门广场高空，从六时半，直延至七时。首都浸沉在狂欢里了。
    指挥宣布：游行开始。两路漫长的行列，在“人民解放军进行曲”的乐声中，分向东西前进。东路游行队伍以被服厂工人为先导，农民跟近，机关人员、学生、部队………继后。这支象征着全国人民大团结的队伍，从早上八点钟，从各个角落汇集到天安门广场，而今已经过去了十多个钟头，没有吃午饭，没有休息，但是，为立国大典的欢欣所鼓舞着，精神始终饱满而充溢，听吧，当队伍踏出三座门的时候，壮伟的歌声响起来了：走！跟着毛泽东走！
    游行开始了。从西长安街到东长安街，从王府井到王府大街，从西单到西四……游行的队伍被夹道欢呼的人群所堵塞，两个单位并列前进已经不可能了。游行的队伍走到哪里，就和夹道群众的掌声连成一片，口号声连成一片。
    在夹道欢呼的人群中间，杂立着为数众多的老年人，有的则搬了一把椅子坐下来。这成为十月一日首都之夜的很大特色。他们有的是很少出门的，可是，用东单大街保康大药房门前的刘老先生的话来说，他们今天却要来看看这“万年不遇的大喜事”了。
    王府井北口，突然卷起一阵急骤的掌声，乐队来了，一百八十件乐器齐奏着“团结就是力量”。追随在乐队之后，一位青年人对他的同伴说：“要是国民党的乐队，你不用想看一看。”他的同伴幽默地回答道：“国民党也有过乐队，不过，跟卖茶叶的差不了多少。”
    乐队的两旁，跟随的人越来越多，形成了一支特别的游行队伍，这是一支没有组织的队伍，可是它被乐队组织起来了。他们与乐队并列行进，他们鼓掌，他们欢呼。马路两旁一群一群的小孩，连那些还刚刚进小学的在内，随着乐声，拍着小手，高唱着“东方红，太阳升，中国出了个毛泽东”和“团结就是力量”。的确，就是这团结的力量，在毛泽东的旗帜之下，为他们的前途创造了无限光明幸福的远景。这情景，给一位酱园掌柜以很深的感动，他意味深长的说：“这真是与民同乐。”
    当游行队伍离开会场两个半小时的时候，整个首都已经为不息的欢呼声所震撼。可是，在天安门广场上，还有长长的行列，正有秩序地踏出会场呢。
    这真是“万年不遇的大喜事”。人们曾经和抗日战争的胜利日的情景作比较。可是，一位小贩说了：“那时候才有几个人，连这三分之一还不到。共产党来了，各行各业全组织起来了，这该是有多少人呵！”其实，真正的意义还不在这里，抗战胜利日，正是国民党匪帮劫收时，当时，人民由于抗战胜利所引起的欢欣，没有几天就被匪帮的魔掌扑灭了，那时的欢欣，正好成为蒙受新的灾难的开始。可是，一九四九年十月一日之夜的狂欢，却正是伟大的中国人民走向繁荣昌盛的开始，为自己创造文明与幸福的开始，这条广阔的大道，伟大领袖毛主席已经指示给我们了。
