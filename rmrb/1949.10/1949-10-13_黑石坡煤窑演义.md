    　　　　First Chapter
    Not far north of Yangquan City, there's Black Stone Slope Village. The village sits on the south slope of a mountain ridge, houses layered one on top of the other from the top to the bottom of the slope. There are quite a few tile-roofed houses and stone cave dwellings in the village, as well as many whitewashed walls; halfway up the slope there is a neat and well-preserved Lao Jun Temple, with brand new murals and freshly dressed Lao Jun statues; looking down from the temple gate, a theater stage faces the temple gate across the dry riverbed at the foot of the slope, with carved railings and red lacquered pillars that look newly painted as well: it seems like a pretty village. However, the men in the village all have black hands, black necks, and black faces, some so black that nothing can be distinguished except for their moving eyeballs. It turns out that the village has very little land, and the slopes in front and behind are all black soil and black stones, with coal found three feet underground; people rely on toiling in the coal mines to make a living, and nine out of ten men in the village are "kiln blacks" (coal miners).

    Now, among the "kiln blacks" in the village, there is an unusual character. This man is nearly fifty years old, but he is tall and large, with round eyes and a wide mouth, and a round, ruddy face; although the hair on the top of his head is almost completely gone, his large bald patch looks as if it has been oiled, shining brightly all year round, making him look strong and healthy, very much like someone who grew up eating pork pancakes, drinking fine tea, and wearing silk socks. This man's name is Zhang Sanxiao, but because of his unusual appearance and the fact that he has been a well-known worker in the mines since childhood, people felt that calling him "Xiao" was not appropriate, so they dropped the "Xiao" from his name and called him Zhang San; and because he was tall, with a big face and big hands, and also of a high generation in the Zhang family in the village, people dropped his surname as well and called him "Da San" (Big Three). The name Da San is quite famous in and around Black Stone Slope.

    Da San grew up as an only child. His mother died very early, and later his father was crushed to death by coal in the mine. There were no siblings at home, only two broken houses, and no means of livelihood. He lived with his uncle from the age of six or seven, picking up scraps of coal near the coal mine in the village. At the age of eleven or twelve, he went down into the mine to carry coal, and by the age of sixteen or seventeen, he was already a good coal digger among the kiln blacks. Later, his uncle also died, but he met an old man who had been sworn brothers with his father in the mine, and he went out to work with that old man.

    Once he left home, the world was his oyster, and there were many coal mines everywhere. Da San quickly developed a great deal of courage, venturing out on his own to Datong and Xuanhua. He had led teams in the famous Xishan Coal Mine in Taiyuan and worked as a foreman in the famous Yilitai Coal Mine in Xihe. He spent his life working in the mines and making a living from coal, relying on his strength, his hands and feet, his eyes, and his ears. He had developed a unique set of skills: he could recognize which mountains had coal and which did not, and whether the coal was good or bad; he could estimate the height of the coal seams at the bottom of the mine, and the thickness of each layer and grade of coal; when going down into the mine, he could identify directions and estimate the distance from the mine entrance even in the winding tunnels; he could also figure out the beginnings of how to deal with water and fire in the mine. With these skills, Da San was able to make a living everywhere, not caring about working in the north after working in the south, fearing neither heaven nor earth.

    However, Da San's temperament helped him, but also hurt him.

    He didn't know how to be tactful, only knowing how to make a living by his skills. If he met an owner or manager who understood his temperament, went along with his inclinations, and met his approval, he would work wholeheartedly and diligently, regardless of how much or how little he was paid, even acting like a fool. But if the owner or manager didn't suit him, was stingy with the workers, nitpicked at the work, and didn't have the ability to convince him, then he wouldn't try to get favors or send gifts or appeal to relationships. If things were good, he would sulk for a couple of days, settle the accounts, and quit. If things were bad, he would dare to stand up against the owner himself. If the workers followed him, he would be willing to risk his life. But if the workers were afraid and didn't follow him, he would rather bear the blame himself and not hold grudges against the workers. Because of this kind of spirit, he could sometimes find a job that suited him and meet a few like-minded workers; but if he didn't, he would be exploited, suffer in the front lines, and be chased away by the owner, who would then give a little benefit to others. Those others would eat the sweets and call him a fool, and he wouldn't even know it.

    从阳泉市往北，走不多远，有个黑石坡村。这村座落在一道山梁的南坡上，从坡顶到坡根，一层一层地满是人家。村里有不少瓦房和石窑洞，也有很多刷上了雪白大灰的粉墙；半坡里还有座整齐完好的老君庙，庙里壁画崭新，老君爷神像新穿新戴；从庙门口往下望，坡根干河沟上一座戏楼正对庙门，戏楼上雕花栏杆和红漆立柱，也都象是刚油漆过的：看来这村远满漂亮。可是，村里男人们隙尽都是黑手黑脖子黑脸，有些人脸上黑得甚么也分不清，只见两个眼珠闪动。原来这村土地很少，坡前坡后尽是黑土黑石头，刨地三尺就有炭；人们靠煤窑里打滚养活，村里男人们，十有九都是窑黑。
    且说村里窑黑里头，有个不平常的人物。这人快五十岁，却长得身高个大，眼圆嘴宽，团团大脸，红光满面；虽说脑袋顶上头发快脱光，可他那一大片秃头皮，却象搽了甚么油、长年明光闪亮，越看越觉着他身强体壮，很象是个一辈子吃猪肉烙饼、喝细茶、穿凉袜长大的人物。这人名叫张三小，就因为他长相不平常，从小又是窑底下有名的干家，人们觉着叫他甚么“小”的不大合适，就把他的名字去了个“小”字，叫他张三；又因为他个大脸大巴掌大，在村里张氏门中辈分也大，所以人们又连他的姓也去掉了，管他叫“大三”。大三这名字，在黑石坡方圆左近，可说是很有些名气。
    大三这人是独根长大的。他妈死得很早，后来他父亲又在窑坑里给炭砸死了，家里又没弟兄姐妹，只两间破房，吃喝二字没半点根底，他从小就跟他大爷过活。他大爷也是要甚没甚，待他这个侄儿，赖倒也不赖，可也没甚么好处；他就从六七岁上在村里煤窑左近拾碎炭，十一二岁下窑底担煤，十六七上，就是窑黑里头一个好刨头了。后来大爷也死了，他却碰了个过去和他父亲在窑底下拜过把兄弟的老汉，就跟那老汉出去跑跳。
    出了门，海阔天空，天下煤窑又多，大三很快就冲出了一身胆量，一个人闯关走口，跑大同，去宣化，在有名的太原府西山煤矿领过岔，也在有名的西河义立泰煤矿当过领事，一辈子窑底下作人，煤里头吃饭，凭力气，凭手脚，眼睛看，耳朵听，居然练出他一身本领：能认出哪座山有炭没炭，炭好炭赖；能估出哪座窑底炭的上下脉有多高，哪一层哪一级的炭有多厚多薄；下窑底，行道九曲十八弯，他也能辨别方向，估量离窑口有多么远近；窑里头哪有水哪有火，碰了水火怎么治，他也能凑合看出个苗头，对付个办法。就仗着这份能耐，大三到处吃得上饭，山南不要有山北，天不怕地不怕。
    可是，大三这股脾气，便宜了他，却也害了他。
    他不会拐弯，只知道凭本领吃饭。要是碰见个东家掌柜的抓住了他的脾气，顺他的劲，对他的眼，他必死心塌地卖命干活，不问不资多少，当了傻子也不啃气。要是东家掌柜的不顺他的劲，不对他的眼，待伙计刻薄，对营生挑剔，又没本领令他心服，那他就不会托门子送礼讲人情，说好的，蹩两天闷气，算帐辞工不干；说赖的，他敢自己个出头反对东家，伙计们若跟他干，他豁出脑袋也心甘情愿，若是伙计们怕事，不跟他干，他也宁愿个人背兴，对伙计不记冤仇。就是这么一股劲，碰对了他也能干两天顺手营生，遇两个知心伙计；可是，碰不对，他却也曾被人利用，档头阵吃苦头，东家撵走了他，回头却拿点甜头给别人吃，人家吃着甜头骂他傻，他还不知道。
