Chahar's northern region, including eight counties: Zhangbei, Chongli, Shangyi, Baoyuan, Shangdu, Kangbao, Huade, and Duolun, has vast land and fertile soil. It is bounded by the Great Wall to the south, bordering the Chahar southern basin, adjacent to Suiyuan to the west, bordering Rehe Province to the southeast, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region to the north, not far from the border of the Mongolian People's Republic. The entire area has a population of 684,858 people, with a cultivated land area of 6,018,012 mu. In areas where land reform has already taken place, the average land per person is about ten mu, and there are also vast areas of wasteland waiting to be reclaimed. In Chabei, ordinary working farmers can cultivate an average of 20 to 30 mu of land. As long as there is labor, there is no shortage of land.

The entire area is a hilly plain, vast and boundless, with excellent soil quality, possessing good conditions for developing agricultural production. In the past, it was known for its grain production. For decades, and in recent years, vast numbers of farmers from various provinces and counties have migrated here to make a living, establishing prosperous families, and the population has gradually increased, with Chabei becoming increasingly prosperous.

Chabei, known as a "granary," produces mainly naked oats, wheat, flax, and potatoes. Each mu of medium-quality cultivated land yields two to three dou (36 jin per dou) in normal years. Naked oats are Chabei's largest product, serving not only as the main food for the local people but also supplying various parts of southern Chahar. Potatoes are an important supplementary food in the area, with large quantities being imported into Zhangjiakou City. Wheat production is also very common, with yields similar to naked oats. Flax is Chabei's major agricultural export. Relying on these abundant agricultural products, farmers exchange them annually for various daily necessities.

Chabei is a nationally renowned animal husbandry region, with vast grasslands suitable for raising herds of cattle, sheep, horses, etc. Therefore, livestock and furs have become Chabei's major products, exported not only to various parts of the country but also in large quantities to foreign countries. The plowing cattle needed for agricultural production, and the mules and horses needed for transportation and sales, can be bought here at very low prices.

The farmers of Chabei traditionally maintain honest and simple characteristics. Most of them have migrated from Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, and various counties in this province in recent decades or years to settle here. Outsiders account for the majority, so they naturally promote the traditional spirit of mutual assistance and mutual aid to newly migrated households. Even to a stranger, a meal at a farmer's home is given without hesitation. In the past, when people in various counties of southern Chahar had no other options, they were willing to "go outside the pass" because, in addition to the good production conditions "outside the pass," the farmers' kind assistance could indeed reduce many difficulties for newcomers. In villages that have undergone land reform and established political power, under the leadership of the village government, they systematically help new immigrants settle down and resolve production difficulties. Therefore, as long as they can work hard and do not suffer from natural disasters, they can generally maintain a middle-class standard of living.

Chabei is a region with extremely promising development prospects. What is needed now is a large number of laborers to settle down and engage in long-term reclamation and construction. It includes vast hills and plains, which are extremely convenient for using tractors for collectivized mechanized farming. Currently, in the Gonghui District of Zhangbei County, the government has established a state-owned mechanized farm, including twenty tractors. In the future, with gradual development, farmers will have a bright future of cooperating and gradually using tractors for farming and production.

Transportation in Chabei will gradually become more developed. There are few mountains and rivers in the territory, and road transportation is very convenient. Starting from Zhangjiakou City, there are three main highways leading to Shangdu, Kangbao, and Duolun. The railway from Zhangjiakou to Zhangbei has a roadbed that is generally intact and urgently needs to be repaired. Because Chabei is located between Mongolia and the Chinese mainland, it has become an important channel for Mongolian-Han trade, with highways directly connecting to Ulaanbaatar in the Mongolian People's Republic. In the past, there were plans to build the Zhangku Railway. Transportation within the territory mostly relies on horseback riding and ox carts. With the gradual development of transportation and new urban-rural exchanges, Chabei will be rapidly transformed from backwardness to prosperity.

In Chabei, in addition to the great convenience of developing agricultural production, there are also other sideline production opportunities and conditions to increase income during the agricultural off-season. Such as picking mushrooms, doing supply and marketing business in the Mongolian region, transporting and selling livestock, furs, mushrooms, flax, naked oats, potatoes, and other products, and then exchanging them for daily necessities, cloth, wood, etc. In addition, women can also spin wool, make sweaters, sew leather clothes, and weave woolen cloth, all of which are good side businesses to increase income.

Chabei's climate is relatively cold, and thick cotton clothing is needed for the winter. It is best to have leather clothing for outdoor work. Although it is cold, it is not as severely cold as generally said. Not every villager in Chabei has leather clothing. Generally, one leather clothing per family is enough to adjust. Many immigrants from other provinces, accustomed to life, do not feel how cold it is. Therefore, even in extremely cold weather, there are no reports of people freezing to death here. People already have rich methods and experiences to keep warm, creating very convenient conditions for staying warm. Furs and leather clothing are very cheap in Chabei, and the handicrafts of felt, wool hats, and wool boots are extremely developed, so you can prepare winter clothing without too much expense.

The rural areas of Chabei are no longer as isolated as in the past. Under the guidance of new urban-rural relations, supply and marketing cooperatives have been established in larger towns and villages in various counties to help farmers sell agricultural products and supply daily necessities and production tools, greatly facilitating farmers in developing production and new immigrant households in settling down. For immigrants, governments at all levels have organized many cadres and concentrated economic resources to resettle them and do their best to take care of them. The immigration work under the leadership of the People's Government is a positive action, aiming to help the urban unemployed find employment and to relieve disasters and overcome famine, to relocate labor, and to develop and prosper new areas. The attitude towards immigrants is to actively help them. Therefore, immigrants can receive help from people everywhere and gradually settle down and become prosperous.

The people of Chabei welcome immigrants to settle down permanently and get rich through production.

　　生产致富的好地方——察北
    察哈尔救灾委会
    察北地区，包括八个县：张北、崇礼、尚义、宝源、商都、康保、化德、多伦，地面辽阔，土地肥沃。南以外长城分界，接连察南盆地，西面紧靠绥远，东南毗连热河省，北面为内蒙古自治区，距离蒙古人民共和国边境不远。全境人口六十八万四千八百五十八人，耕地面积为六百○一万八千○一十二亩。在已经土地改革地区，每人平均土地在十亩左右，此外尚有广大荒地急待垦发。在察北，普通劳动农民平均也能耕作二十至三十亩耕地，只要有劳动力，土地是不缺的。
    全境为丘陵平原，广阔无际，土质极好，具有发展农业生产的良好条件。过去曾以产粮著称。数十年以及近数年以来，各省县的广大农民络绎迁移来此谋生，建立起丰裕的家务，人口逐渐增加，察北日渐繁荣了起来。
    向称“粮仓”的察北，农产品以莜麦、小麦、胡麻、山药为大宗，每亩中等耕地，在平常年成收获二斗至三斗（每斗三十六斤）。莜麦为察北的最大出产，除成为本区人民的主要食品外，并供给察南各地。山药蛋为本区重要的粮食辅助食品，大量输入张家口市。小麦出产亦很普遍，产量与莜麦差不多。胡麻为察北之大宗出口农产物。靠着这些丰富的农产，每年农民换回了各种日用必需品。
    察北为全国有名的畜牧区域，有广阔无际的草原，足供喂养成群的牛、羊、马等。因此，牲畜、皮毛成为察北的大宗出产物，不仅输出到全国各地，而且大量的输往国外。农业生产上所需用的耕牛，交通运销所需要的骡马，在这里用很低廉的价格，即可以买到。
    察北的农民，传统地保持着诚实敦厚的性格，他们大部分是近数十年来或数年来由山西、河北、山东及本省各县迁移来此安家的。外来人占着大部，因此对于新迁往的外来户，都能自然地发扬着互助互济的传统精神；即使是一个陌生的人，到农民家里，吃一顿饭是毫不吝惜的。过去察南各县的人们，在当地没办法的时候，都愿意“出口外”，原因是除开“口外”具备了良好的生产条件外，农民厚道的帮助，确实能够减少外来户不少安家困难。在经过土改建政的村庄，在村政府领导下，对于新移去的移民，都在有计划地帮助安家立业，解决生产困难。因此，只要能够勤劳生产，和不遭受自然的灾害，普通总能保持中等生活光景。
    察北是一个极有发展前途的地区，现在所需要的是大批劳动力去安家落户，长期从事垦发建设。它包括有广阔的丘陵、平原，极便利使用拖拉机进行集体化的机械耕作。现在，在张北县的公会区已经由政府建立了包括有二十辆拖拉机的国营机垦农场，以后慢慢的发展，农民们大有合作起来，逐渐使用拖拉机进行耕作生产的光辉前途。
    察北的交通将会日渐发达起来，境内很少山河，公路交通是很方便的。由张家口市起，有三条公路干线通往商都、康保及多伦。铁路有由张家口通往张北的一段，路基大体完好，急待修建。由于察北介于蒙古与中国内地之间，成为蒙汉贸易的重要孔道，有公路直通蒙古人民共和国之库伦，以前曾筹划过建筑张库铁路。境内交通多以骑马、牛车等运输，在交通逐渐发达及新的城乡交流下，将促使察北迅速由落后走向富裕。
    在察北，除发展农业生产有着极大的便利之外，也还有着其他的副业生产门路及条件，可以增加农暇的收入。如采蘑菇，做蒙区的供销生意，把牲畜、皮毛、蘑菇、胡麻、莜麦、山药等产品运销出去，再换回日用品、布匹、木材等等，此外，妇女们尚可纺毛线、做毛衣、缝皮衣、织毛呢，都是能增加收入的良好副业。
    察北的气候，比较寒冷，过冬需要准备很厚的棉衣，外出干活最好有皮衣。虽然寒冷，但是也并不如一般所说冷的厉害。察北的老乡并不是人人都有皮衣，一般的一家人内大致有一件皮衣，即可调剂。不少外省移民，生活惯了，也就不觉得怎样寒冷。因此在这里在极冷的时候，也并没有冻死人的消息。人们已有御寒的丰富的方法与经验，创造了很方便的御寒条件，察北的皮毛、皮衣都很便宜，毛毡、毛帽、毛靴等手工业又极其发达，因此不需太多的花费，就可准备下过冬的衣物了。
    现在的察北农村，已不象过去那样的闭塞，在新的城乡关系指导之下，各县较大村镇均建立起供销合作社来，帮助农民推销农业品和供给生活用品及生产工具，大大地便利了农民发展生产和新移民户安家中的困难。对于移民，各级政府组织了不少干部力量与集中经济力量进行安置，尽力照顾。人民政府领导下的移民工作，是有着积极意义的行动，为着帮助城市的失业人口就业及救灾渡荒，为着迁移劳动力，开辟与繁荣新的地区，对待移民的态度是积极帮助的。因此，移民就能够到处得到人们的扶助，而逐渐安家立业，走向富裕。
    察北各地人民，都很欢迎移民去长期安家落户，生产致富的。
