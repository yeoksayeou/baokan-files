　　Central China's Three Columns of Troops Advance Westward and Southward
    Over 10,000 Bandits Annihilated on All Fronts
    Western Route Continues to Capture Huang County, Jing County, and Wugang
    [Xinhua News Agency, Central China Front, 10th] After a month of rest and reorganization, the People's Liberation Army on the Central China Front is in high spirits and advancing westward and southward in three major columns. After successively capturing more than a hundred towns and cities, large and small, they are now taking advantage of their victories to vigorously expand their gains. The Western Route Army of the People's Liberation Army has been driving straight down the Changde-Zhijiang Highway since mid-September. The remnants of the Liu Jiashu Corps collapsed at the first touch. The People's Liberation Army successively occupied eleven county towns including Yuanling, Luxi, Chenxi, Xupu, Huaihua, Mayang, Zhijiang, Qianyang, Huitong, Huang County, and Jing County, as well as more than a hundred towns such as Anjiang, Hongjiang, and Jiangkou, completely cutting off the Hunan-Guizhou Highway, annihilating more than 5,000 remnants of the bandits, and over 1,000 bandits surrendered. The Central Route Army, between the 4th and 6th of this month, broke through the remnant bandit positions between Shaoyang and Hengyang in one fell swoop. On the morning of the 8th, they liberated the important strategic base and air force base of Hengyang City, and re-liberated Xinhua County, capturing more than ten towns including Yongfeng, Qingshuping, Baiguoshi, Zhajiang, and Honglemiao. The remnant bandits fled in panic, and the People's Liberation Army is pursuing them fiercely. Another unit of the People's Liberation Army successively liberated the two cities of Yongxing and Leiyang on the Yuehan Railway, thereby cutting off the Hengyang to Guangzhou section of the Yuehan Road, and annihilating more than 3,000 bandits. After crossing the Five Ridges Mountains, the Eastern Route Army, in coordination with the South China People's Guerrilla Force, also successively liberated four cities including Guidong, Nanxiong, Shixing, and Rucheng, annihilating more than 1,500 enemies, and occupied Qujiang City, the gateway to northern Guangdong, on the 7th of this month. The defending enemy fled at the news. Another unit of the People's Liberation Army is advancing towards Yingde from the Wengyuan and Xinfeng lines, and one unit has reached Laolong, east of Longchuan. The various units of the army are echoing and coordinating with each other, pursuing the Kuomintang remnant bandits.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Central China Front, 10th] The Western Route of the People's Liberation Army on the Central China Front liberated Wugang County in southwestern Hunan Province at 9:40 am on the 10th. The entire defending enemy regiment was annihilated, and the results of the battle are being cleared.
