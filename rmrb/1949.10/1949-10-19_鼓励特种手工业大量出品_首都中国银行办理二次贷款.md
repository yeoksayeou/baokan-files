　　Encouraging Mass Production of Special Handicrafts
  　Bank of China in the Capital Offers Second Loans
    [Report from this newspaper] The Bank of China in Beijing issued its first special handicraft loan in June of this year. As of the 15th of this month, two-thirds of the loans have been repaid (228 out of the original 343 loan recipients). The second loan is now being processed. The bank's first loan totaled 31.09 million RMB, benefiting 343 special handicraft workshops (including cloisonné enamel, copper and pewter ware, porcelain, silver filigree, ivory carving, drawnwork embroidery, inlaying, filigree, stone and wood carving, jade ware, glasswork, carpets, embroidery, jade tree bonsai, carved lacquerware, bone carving, paper flowers, and other 17 trades). This played a significant role in the recovery of special handicrafts. At the same time, the state bank's flexible control of foreign exchange rates and smooth exports have enabled the industry to develop rapidly. According to a survey by the Special Handicraft United Association, only about 130 Beijing special handicraft businesses were able to operate when the bank issued its first loan, due to the long-term oppression of the Kuomintang reactionary rule and difficulties in exporting. After the first loan was widely supported, the number of producers has risen to more than 1,100 to date. Within the four months from June to September, they produced products worth approximately 111 million RMB. In order to further develop the industry, the bank began processing the second loan in mid-October. According to the person in charge of the bank: "The first loan had a broader scope to generally support the resumption of production, with most loans being 100,000 RMB. The purpose of this loan is to help develop production. All special handicraft factories and workshops whose products can directly or indirectly be sold abroad to earn foreign exchange are eligible for loans. Special emphasis will be placed on supporting those that can export in large quantities, such as cloisonné enamel, copper and pewter ware, and silver filigree. The loan amount will be determined based on the actual needs of producing export products and with reference to the performance of the first loan agreement. The order of issuance is based on the first list of 576 households submitted by the Special Handicraft United Association, which will be processed in four batches. The first batch of 116 households has been found qualified. After the loan application is returned to the Bank of China for review to determine whether the loan amount meets the actual situation, the loan procedures will be processed." As for the loan term and interest, the regulations stipulate that the term is determined by the length of the production process, ranging from one to three months. For example, paper flowers, bone carving, and drawnwork embroidery have shorter production processes, so the term is one month. Others, such as copper and pewter ware, cloisonné enamel, and carpets, have longer production processes, so the term is two to three months. The interest rate remains the same as the first loan, at 10% per month. (Yu)

　　鼓励特种手工业大量出品
  　首都中国银行办理二次贷款
    【本报讯】北京中国银行于本年六月间发放之第一次特种手工业贷款，截至本月十五日，归还者已有三分之二（原贷款户三百四十三户，现归还者二百二十八户）。现又开始办理第二次贷款。该行第一次贷款，前后共发放人民币三千一百零九万元，受益的特种手工业作坊有三百四十三户（包括珐琅、铜锡器、烧瓷、银蓝、象牙、挑补花、镶嵌、花丝、石木雕刻、玉器、料器、地毯、刺绣、玉树盆景、雕漆、骨器、纸花等十七业）、对特种手工业之恢复起了显著作用；同时由于国家银行机动掌握外汇牌价，出口顺畅，更使该业得以迅速发展。据特种手工艺联合会调查：该行第一次发放贷款时，北京特种手工业由于久经国民党反动统治的压榨，及出口困难，当时能开工者仅残存一百三十余家。经过第一次贷款普遍得到扶植后，至目前止，已恢复生产者达一千一百余家。在六至九四个月内，生产了约值人民币一亿一千余万元的产品。该行为使该业更加发展，本月中旬起又开始办理第二次贷款。据该行负责人谈：“为普遍扶植其恢复生产，第一次贷款范围较广，款额多为十万元；此次贷款则以帮助其发展生产为目的。凡特种手工业工厂与作坊之产品，能直接间接行销国外换取外汇者，均为贷款对象。其中并偏重扶植其能大量输出者，如珐琅、铜锡品、烧瓷、银蓝等业。贷款额度，本其制作出口产品上之实际需要，参酌对第一次贷款契约履行等情形决定。发放次序，系根据特种手工艺联合会提出之首批名单五百七十六户分四批办理，第一批一百十六户已调查合格，俟贷款申请书交回中国银行审核所贷之款额是否符合实际情况后，即行办理贷款手续。”至于贷款期限、利息，据规定：期限以生产过程长短而确定，一至三个月不等，如纸花、骨器、挑补花等，因生产过程较短，均为一个月期。其他如铜锡器、珐琅、地毯等，因生产过程较长，期限为二个月至三个月。利息仍与第一次同，月息十分。    （宇）
