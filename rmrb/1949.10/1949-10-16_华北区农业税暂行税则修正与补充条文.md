　　Amendments and Supplementary Provisions to the Provisional Agricultural Tax Regulations for the North China Region

　　[This newspaper reports] The North China People's Government promulgated the Amendments and Supplementary Provisions to the Provisional Agricultural Tax Regulations for the North China Region on October 14 and ordered all regions to implement them. The original text is as follows:

　　(1) Article 3, Item 3: "…Agricultural tax on leased land shall be paid by both the landlord and tenant through consultation, but the government shall uniformly register and collect from the lessor."

　　After the land reform, most of the leased land belongs to families of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, and workers, as well as elderly, weak, orphaned, and widowed individuals without labor capacity who have difficulty making a living. The lessees mostly have labor or livestock, or have relatives to help them. Therefore, the amount of rent varies, and it is not appropriate to make a rigid decision on who should bear the burden.

　　(2) Article 4, Item 3: "…However, if cultivated land is converted to forest, the tax shall be levied at 30% of the normal annual yield of the major grain crops grown on the cultivated land, converted into grain."

　　Should the normal annual yield be assessed based on the forest or the grain crops when cultivated land is converted to forest? All regions have sent letters inquiring about this. This amendment is made to clarify the tax regulations.

　　(3) Article 5, Item 1: "…Fallow land that has been fallow for more than five years shall be regarded as virgin land."

　　The original Article 5, Item 1, "…Fallow land that has been fallow for more than six years shall be regarded as virgin land" is inconsistent with Item 2, "…The term fallow land in the preceding paragraph refers to cultivated land that has been out of cultivation for three to five years." Therefore, it is amended as above.

　　An additional Item 5 is added: "Privately-owned and cooperative nurseries before they generate income."

　　This item is added to encourage the development of privately-owned nurseries and to solve the problem of seedlings in the afforestation movement.

　　(4) Article 9: "Orchards, mulberry gardens, bamboo gardens, mountain products, and lotus ponds shall be calculated as standard mu based on 50% of their total income, converted into grain according to the normal annual yield and the general wholesale market price during the selling season. Reed and cattail land shall be calculated as standard mu based on 80% of their total income, converted into grain." (The standard for setting production shall also be amended accordingly).

　　The original article did not specify the levy standard for reed and cattail land. Regions have reflected that it would be disadvantageous if the tax is not levied according to a discount. Furthermore, Article 9 of the Provisional Agricultural Tax Regulations "…refer to the average wholesale price during the harvest and selling seasons…" is inconsistent with Article 4 of the "Regulations of this Government on Determining the Number of Mu of Land and the Normal Annual Yield for Agricultural Tax" "…and shall be calculated based on 50% of the general market price during the selling season, converted into grain." This led to different interpretations of "average wholesale price" and "general market price," as well as "refer to the harvest and selling seasons" and "according to the selling season." To avoid misunderstanding, the above amendments are made.

　　Based on feedback from various regions, the output of fruit trees, mulberry gardens, and mountain products changes significantly due to the increase and decline of annual rings. Therefore, a supplementary item is added to the original article:

　　"If the normal annual yield of the aforementioned fruit trees, mulberry gardens, and mountain products undergoes significant changes due to the increase and decline of annual rings, which affects the burden, the standard mu may be revised according to the specific circumstances."

　　(5) Article 11: "…(1) Elderly, weak, orphaned, widowed, and disabled individuals without labor capacity who have impoverished families and difficulty making a living.

　　(2) Families of revolutionary martyrs, revolutionary soldiers, and revolutionary workers without labor capacity who have impoverished families and difficulty making a living." (All tax regulations involving families of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, and workers shall be amended in accordance with this government's respect for revolutionary martyrs and soldiers).

　　The original article did not include elderly, weak, and disabled individuals without labor capacity who have impoverished families and difficulty making a living. Furthermore, the scope of revolutionary workers is too narrow, which may cause unnecessary disputes during implementation. Therefore, the amendments are made as above.

　　(6) Article 15: "…Each burden mu shall be levied 22 jin of millet per year…" The number of local grain payments remains unchanged.

　　华北区农业税暂行税则
    修正与补充条文
    【本报讯】华北人民政府于十月十四日颁布华北区农业税暂行税则修正与补充条文，并命令各地执行。原文如下：
    （一）第三条第三项“……租佃地之农业税由业佃双方协商缴纳，但政府统一向出租人登记征收之。”
    土改后，一般出租土地的多系烈、军、工属及老、弱、孤、寡无劳动力而生活困难者，承租人多是有劳力或有畜力的，也有亲戚帮忙的，因而租额多少不一，由谁负担不宜作硬性决定。
    （二）第四条第三款“……但以耕地改植林木者，应按耕地种植主要粮谷作物之常年应产量折谷三成征税”
    对耕地改植林木是以林木还是以粮谷作物评定常年应产量？各地都来函询问，为税则明确起见，而有此修正。
    （三）第五条第一款“………熟荒已满五年以上者，视为生荒。”
    原第五条第一款“………熟荒已满六年者，视为生荒”与第二款“………前项所称熟荒系指停止耕作三年至五年之耕地”有不吻合之处故修正如上。
    另增第五款“在未有收益前之私营与合作苗圃地”。
    为奖励私营苗圃之发展和解决造林运动中树苗问题而加此款。
    （四）第九条“果木园、桑园、竹园、山货及藕池等地按其常年应产量及收获期间出卖之一般批发市价以其总收入之五成折谷计算标准亩。蒲苇、荻地以其总收入之八成折谷计算标准亩。”（订产标准亦仿此修正）。
    原条文对蒲苇、荻地之征收标准没有规定，各地反映如不按折扣计征，则有些吃亏。且农业税暂行税则第九条“………参照收获与出卖季节之平均批发价格………”与本府“关于农业税土地亩数及常年应产量订定标准的规定”第四“………并应按出卖季节之一般市价折谷五成计算”发生了“平均批发价格”与“一般市价”及“参照收获与出卖季节”与“按出卖季节”之不同解释，为避免误解，而修正如上。
    根据各地反映，果木、桑园、山货因年轮之增长衰老，其产量变化颇大故于原条内加补充一项为：
    “前项果木、桑园、山货之常年应产量，如因年轮之增长、衰老，其收获量起显著变化，致影响负担者，其标准亩得依具体情况予以改订。”
    （五）第十一条“……（一）老、弱、孤、寡、残疾、无劳动力而家境贫困生活困难者。
    （二）烈士家属及革命军人、革命工作人员家属之无劳动力而家境贫困生活困难者。”（凡税则涉及烈、军、工属者均依本府尊重烈士、革命军人之规定修正之）
    原条文未包括无劳动力家境贫困生活困难之老、弱、残疾；且革命职员范围太小，执行时恐引起不必要之争执，故修正如上。
    （六）第十五条：“……每一负担亩每年征收小米二十二市斤……”地方粮款负担数不变。
