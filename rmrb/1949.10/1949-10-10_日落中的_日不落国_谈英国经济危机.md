　　The "Sun Never Sets" Empire in Decline
    —Talking about the British Economic Crisis
    Duan Liancheng
    A high-ranking American tycoon visited England a year ago. At a banquet, in his capacity as a creditor, he kept boasting about the richness and beauty of America. Finally, he modestly said, "But England is indeed lovely, for example, those lush green lawns everywhere. I don't know how you cultivate them?" The British gentlemen present all felt that the "honored guest" was arrogant and swallowed their anger. Only one, with more courage, humorously said, "Growing lawns is very simple. Just mow them every morning for five hundred years, and they will be done." Counting American history, since its independence and founding in 1783, it has only been 167 years. On this point, the American tycoon was checkmated. He had to retort, "Yes, everything in the British Empire has such a long history."
    Don't boast of your ancestors' wealth when you are poor. The British Empire, once at its peak and known as the "sun never sets" empire, is now being brought to its knees by the "upstart" American imperialism. Facing economic difficulties, instead of seeking self-reliance, it turns to a group of evil creditors on Wall Street, accelerating the auction of all those ancestral properties with "long histories"; with limited income, instead of improving people's livelihoods, it follows the fascist elements in Washington, engaging in military adventures around the world, spending money to suppress the vast masses of people who are struggling to turn over. As a result, it becomes poorer and poorer, and economic crises follow one after another.
    　　　　Living on Borrowed Money
    Opening the British Empire's income and expenditure ledger, deficits are everywhere. Based on the figures for April this year, Britain buys goods worth $2.2 billion from the Western Hemisphere annually, sells $860 million worth, with a deficit of $1.34 billion; buys goods worth $3.811 billion from the British Empire's self-governing territories and India (Canada is included in the Western Hemisphere), sells $3.576 billion, with a deficit of $235 million; buys goods worth $2.938 billion from other parts of the world, sells $2.424 billion. After offsetting each other, the total deficit reaches $2.089 billion. Calculated on the average of 50 million people in the British Isles, this amount means that every person, young and old, has to spend more than 41 US dollars a year.
    How could the British Empire have fallen to this point? The main reason is that in the inherent conflicts between capitalist countries, it was defeated by the upstart American imperialism. At its peak, Britain's territories were all over the world. It used the cheap labor of the colonies to develop and occupy the resources of the colonies, and then copied or simply did not copy the products, transported them to other places, and sold them at high prices. A great deal of money was made in the process. For example, the British only spent eight or nine cents US dollars an hour on wages to grow rubber in Malaya, and then shipped it to India, immediately earning ten times the profit. Since the end of World War II, with the expansion of American imperialist power, most of this convenient business has been taken away by it. At the same time, American goods followed wherever the American army went. For example, in the Kuomintang-controlled areas of China, American goods were sold in every stall and shop; in Hong Kong under the rule of the British Empire, the most standard Chinese food, fermented bean curd, was mostly the "Golden Mountain Brand" imported from the United States sold in most stores; another example is India, one of Britain's largest markets, which is also being flooded with American goods. In 1938, the total value of US exports to India was 8 million pounds, but now it is 100 million pounds. In this way, Wall Street's financial resources are booming, and the British Empire cannot help but become impoverished.
    In trying to solve the economic problem, the British Labor government has chosen Wall Street, its deadly enemy. Borrowing is possible; the tycoons have plenty of money. But is it really helping based on friendship? No, the bosses do business for money. Since the end of the war, the United States has given aid and loans to Britain many times. The most important one is a large sum in the Marshall Plan. The political condition for borrowing money is to be completely subservient to the United States in diplomacy, which is well known and needs no further explanation. The economic condition is that restrictions on American goods entering the Sterling Area should be reduced; and that the main part of the loan should be used to purchase from the United States. As restrictions on the import of American goods were reduced, a large number of Hollywood's pornographic films, cheaper American cigarettes, and other consumer goods flooded into England. As a result, American aid to Britain, paid for by American taxpayers, quickly went into the pockets of Wall Street tycoons. Due to the restrictions on the areas where aid could be used to purchase goods, Britain had to import large quantities of grain from the United States at higher prices, helping Wall Street solve the problem of overproduction. Recently, Washington has been extra generous in allowing Britain to purchase Canadian wheat, and reactionary Senator Ferguson immediately roared and advocated adding other restrictions. Another said that this move was tantamount to "importing more and more unemployment" for the United States.
    Under these multiple restrictions, American capitalists have reaped a hundredfold profit in "aiding Britain." In the past fifteen months, Britain's total imports from the dollar area amounted to $2.324 billion, half of which—$1.307 billion—was paid for by "Marshall Aid." And Britain itself is getting poorer the more it receives "aid." Chancellor of the Exchequer Cripps, in order to promote thrift, does not even put sugar in his coffee. The suffering of the general public is imaginable. It is said that during the war, people queuing in the streets of London to buy rations were mostly well-dressed. But today, in the longer rationing lines, the British, known for their "gentlemanly style," although they all iron their old trousers neatly, one often sees that the "gentlemen" are so poor that they have no socks, and their old leather shoes hide a bare foot. By April this year, Britain's gold and dollar reserves had fallen to $1.624 billion. Traditionally, the British believe that a reserve reduction to $2 billion is a sign of financial risk. Because if they just sit and eat, and spend all of this family inheritance, they will go bankrupt.
    In order to save the crisis, in early September this year, Foreign Secretary Bevin and Chancellor of the Exchequer Cripps once again crossed the ocean to seek accommodation from the creditors on Wall Street. The consistent view of wealthy Americans on Britain's economic problems is that the British are poor but unwilling to endure hardship, and they spend beyond their means, resulting in accumulated deficits. For example, after the Labor Party implemented the cosmetic "public health system," some poor British people also got dentures and glasses. Wall Street believes that this money does not need to be spent, and the American press under its control has widely criticized and publicized it. A widely published cartoon shows a British ophthalmologist replacing the eye chart used to test vision with a list of letters that gradually shrink into a sentence: "If these glasses weren't free, do you think you should be here?" Therefore, when Cripps arrived in Washington this time, the tycoons insisted that the British tighten their belts and produce goods in exchange for dollars. After six days of secret talks, the "Ten-Point Plan" was announced, vaguely stating that the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada, which participated in the meeting, would increase Britain's dollar income with "greater efforts"; and affirming that the United Kingdom "will eliminate as much as possible" investment barriers in the Sterling Area for dollars. In addition, there was a magic trick for Cripps to quietly bring back to England. On the evening of September 18, Cripps broadcast, "arriving like a thief in the night" (according to the London Times), suddenly announcing the devaluation of the pound, from four dollars and eight cents per pound to two dollars and eighty cents. The reason given was to stimulate British exports and earn more dollars.
    　　　　Devaluation of Laboring People
    What exactly does this string of seemingly complicated economic terms, "devaluation," "stimulating exports," and "increasing dollar income," represent? To give a simple example: A British-made small truck is worth about 300 pounds. According to the original ratio of British and American currencies, it would sell for $1,200 in the United States. Now that the pound has been reduced from 4.08 to 2.80 to one, the same truck is only worth $840 in the United States. If the price of goods falls, the number of buyers will increase, and exports will increase accordingly, naturally earning more dollars. This sounds very reasonable, but a closer calculation shows that it is not the case. In the past, Britain only needed to export two trucks to earn $2,400. But now, to earn this amount, it needs to sell three trucks. In other words, British auto exports must increase by one-third in order to earn the same number of dollars as in the past. If it relies on this to make up for the British Empire's deficit, British sales need to increase several times. And would the four major American auto companies be willing to give their customers to Britain? General Motors, Ford, Kaiser, Chrysler, and other manufacturers are all cutting prices to seek sales. If the British are cheaper, they will definitely find ways to compete and resist. Secondly, Britain's grain and many industrial raw materials must be purchased from the United States and its controlled areas. A bag of flour is worth eight US dollars. In the past, Britain only needed to spend two pounds to buy it, but after devaluation, it has to spend 5.6 pounds. If the price of grain and raw materials rises, the price of other goods will naturally rise as well. No matter how the pound is devalued, won't the price of British goods overseas be restored?
    If that is the case, how can the devaluation of the pound take effect? The creditors on Wall Street have long had a plan. The spokesman of the Federal Reserve Board of the United States once pointed out three methods a week ago: First, the British government should drastically reduce administrative expenses; second, increase production, and encourage factory owners and workers in this regard; and third, prevent the prices of finished products from catching up with the level of devaluation. What does this mean? Reducing administrative expenses means that Britain should stop or reduce many public welfare programs, and lower the salaries of a large number of civil servants. Increasing production means that workers should extend their working hours and work especially hard; as for factory owners, producing more and earning more money, the talk of "encouraging" them to increase production is just lip service. Preventing the prices of finished products from rising means that workers should not ask for wage increases regardless of how expensive food and other things are. On this point, the Labor Party government was already prepared. On the eve of the Washington Tripartite Talks, the 81st session of the British Trades Union Congress, manipulated by trade union scum, made a promise not to increase wages. Therefore, the real meaning of the devaluation of the pound is the "devaluation" of the laboring people.
    　　　　Ancestral Properties Auctioned, All at 30% Off
    In addition to further exploiting the British laboring people, another meaning of Wall Street wanting the pound to be devalued is to force the British Empire to auction off its ancestral properties, with all goods selling at a 30% discount. The "Ten-Point Plan" clearly stated that Britain "will eliminate as much as possible" barriers to dollar investment. After the "barriers" are eliminated, American tycoons will pretend to be carrying bags full of US dollars, swaggering into England and other British territories. Things that originally sold for four dollars and eight cents now only cost two dollars and eighty cents, so they buy stocks, buy land, things are of good quality and low price. American imperialism has already obtained the majority of the oil fields in the Near East; and it has also begun to interfere in the gold mines in South Africa. The most obvious recent manifestation is in Southeast Asia: some tin mines and rubber plantations in Malaya will be directly mined by American companies; "American Smelting Company" has obtained mining rights to many mines in Burma, and Rockefeller's "Mobil Company" is squeezing out the Burmese Oil Company; oil, coal, iron, and forests in northwestern British Borneo are all being operated by the United States. The ultimate goal of all this is to turn England into the forty-ninth state of the United States, usurp all British overseas interests, and completely place the British people under the rule of Wall Street.
    　　　　Blood Poisoning, Seeking a Snake Doctor
    Is the British economic crisis so deep that there is really no cure? Not at all. Although national financial problems are complicated, balancing income and expenditure still cannot escape the old saying of "increasing income and reducing expenditure." How to increase income? We must do business honestly, exchanging what we have for what we don't have. Socialist Soviet Union has large quantities of grain that can be exported; the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe are in the midst of vigorous construction and need a lot of machinery and industrial products; and the new China at the beginning of its business is also willing to do business with Britain on an equal basis. But the Labor government has abandoned these good customers, and following Wall Street, is creating a Cold War and building trade barriers between Eastern and Western Europe. In 1948, the total amount of British trade with Eastern Europe was reduced to 48% of that in 1938. In the East, it abandoned its diplomatic independence and followed behind American imperialism, opposing the Chinese people. American imperialism wants to use economic blockade to strangle the progressive regimes in the world, but as a result, it is hitting its own foot with a brick, and its number one helper, the British Empire, has been seriously injured. Bevin and Cripps abandoned their proper business and went to Wall Street again and again to borrow money. But the capitalist system determines that exploitation and making money are the creditors' eternal and only goals. No matter how loyal Britain's policies towards Wall Street are, the tycoons will not recognize friends and really help. The result is just like blood poisoning, seeking a snake doctor, a dead end.
    The other aspect of balancing income and expenditure is reducing expenditure. Let's take a look at the expenditures of the British Empire. In 1949 to 1950, the estimated defense expenditure is 760 million pounds; the number announced in the previous year was 692 million pounds, but in reality it was more than this. Taking the number for this year, the military expenditure burden for each British person is more than 15 pounds. According to the old British-American currency ratio, it is more than 60 US dollars. This article mentioned earlier that the average per capita deficit in Britain each year is 41 US dollars. This amount is more than enough to make up for with defense spending. Of course, a country cannot be completely without military expenditure, but except for the determination to follow Wall Street in a frenzy of arms expansion, impoverished Britain has no reason to spend so much money unjustly. In terms of offsetting the trade deficit, Britain earns 1 billion US dollars annually due to its developed shipping industry and many overseas investments and banking businesses. But Britain's overseas expenses, according to the Americans, amount to 750 million US dollars. How can there be such a large overseas expenditure? It is to maintain troops to oppress the people everywhere. The British Empire's troops are now stationed in the Middle East; Honduras, Jamaica, and Bermuda in the Western Hemisphere; most parts of Africa such as Egypt, the Suez Canal area, the Gold Coast, and Somaliland; Europe such as Greece; the East such as Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong. The number of British troops stationed is still increasing. For example, in the war to massacre the people in Malaya, the government admits to spending 31,500 pounds a day. According to the Oxford Institute of Statistics, the minimum price of staple foods for a British family of five per week is 48 shillings and 8 pence, then this single war expenditure in Malaya can support more than 8,800 families, close to 50,000 poor British people. This situation is just like a broken household that works day and night, but spends money to buy knives and guns, and follows a rogue (American imperialism) to bully good people. In this way, life will of course become more of a problem.
    Based on the above reasons, it can be asserted that the only cure for the British economic crisis is "peace." Only with peace can it break away from Wall Street and not be continuously exploited by creditors; only with peace can it do business with the world's vast camp of peace and open up financial resources; only with peace can it eliminate a large amount of military expenditure and reduce expenses. But the hypocritical Labor Party and the die-hard Conservative Party will not adopt this prescription. Therefore, only after the forces of peace control the British regime can economic difficulties be resolved; and the setting sun of the British Empire can be reborn.

　　日落中的“日不落国”
    —谈英国经济危机
    段连城
    一个高级的美国大亨，年前访问英伦。在一个宴会里，他以债主子的身份，不停地夸耀美国的富饶美好。最后自谦几句说：“不过英伦真也可爱，譬如那处处碧绿的草地，不知道你们是如何培植出来的？”在座的英国绅士们，都感到“贵宾”盛气凌人，气往肚里吞。只有一个胆子较壮，幽默地说：“种草地很简单，只要每天早晨刈一次，连续五百年便成。”回算美国历史，自一七八三年独立开国，至今不过一六七年。在这一点上，美国大亨是被吃住了。他不得不回敬一句：“是啊，大英帝国的一切，历史都是那末悠长。”
    家贫休夸祖上富。在盛极一时号称“日不落国”的大不列颠帝国，如今是被“后起之秀”的美帝，搞得落日奄奄，末路途穷了。经济困难，不求自力更生，却找上华尔街的一群恶债主，把那“历史悠长”的一切祖产，日益加速地拍卖；收入有限，不图改善民生，却跟着华盛顿一伙法西斯分子，四海穷兵黩武，花钱去压制奋力翻身的广大人民。结果是越搞越穷，经济危机，接踵而来。
    　　　　借债度日
    翻开大英帝国的出入流水帐，处处都见赤字。以今年四月的数字为基准，英国每年向西半球买进的东西，值二十二亿美元，卖出的值八亿六千万，亏空是十三亿四千万元；向大英帝国各自治领及印度（加拿大已算入西半球）买进是三十八亿一千一百万元，卖出三十五亿七千六百万元，亏空二亿三千五百万元；向世界其他地区，买进是二十九亿三千八百万元，卖出二十四亿二千四百万元。相支两抵，赤字共达二十亿八千九百万元。若按英伦三岛人口五千万平均计算，这数目表示无论老小，每人每年得用出头四十一块多美元。
    大英帝国何以会落未至此呢？主要是因为在资本主义国家间先天决定的冲突里，被美帝这个暴发户打倒了。在他的极盛时期，不列颠的属地遍全球。他用殖民地的贱价人工，开发霸占来的殖民地资源，然后将产品加以复制，或者根本不复制，运到别的地方，高价出卖。转手之间，大赚其钱。譬如马来亚的橡皮，英国人只花八九分钱美金一小时的工资，种植出来，送到印度，立刻赚钱十倍。自第二次大战结束后，美帝势力扩张，这种方便生意，多半被其夺去。同时，美军所到之处，美货接踵而来。譬如，在国民党区的中国，哪处地摊商店，不售美货；在大英帝国治下的香港，最标准的中国食品豆腐乳，多数商店卖的都是自美进口的“金山牌”；又如英国最大市场之一的印度，也由美货在倾销，一九三八年美国对印输出的总值是八百万英镑，而现在是一亿英镑。这样一来，华尔街是财源茂盛，大英帝国便不免家徒四壁了。
    在设法解决经济问题中，英国工党政府却偏找上华尔街这个死对头。借债可以，大亨们有的是钱。讲交情真就帮助吗？没有的事，老板们做生意为的是钱。自大战结束以后，美国对英的布施及贷款，先后已有多次。最重要的，是马歇尔计划里的一大笔。借钱的政治条件，是外交上完全做美国的附庸，世所共知，不待多言。经济上的条件，是美货进入英镑区，要减少限制；是在贷款的使用中，主要部分应向美国购买。由于美货进口的限制减少，大批好莱坞的色情电影，价钱较廉的美国香烟及其他消费品，便大批冲进英伦。于是，由美国人民大众纳税而支付的对英援款，很快便转到华尔街大亨们的荷包里。由于对援款购买地区的限制，英国遂必须用较高的价格，从美国进口大批粮食，帮助华尔街解决生产过剩的问题。最近华盛顿额外开恩，准许英国购买加拿大小麦，反动参议员费古逊立刻大肆咆哮，主张新加别种限制。另一个说此举无异是替美国“输入日益更多的失业”。
    在这些重重限制下，美国资本家们便在“援英”中利市百倍。在过去十五个月中，英国自美元区域进口总值二十三亿二千四百万美元，其中一半——十三亿零七百万元——都是靠“马歇尔援款”支付。而英国自己，却愈受“援助”愈穷了。财相克里浦斯，为了提倡节约，喝咖啡都不放糖。一般人民的困苦，可想而知。据说在战争期间，伦敦街上排队买配给品的人，大都衣冠整齐。而今天，在更长的配给队伍里，以“绅士派”闻名的英国人，虽然都把旧裤子熨得挺挺，但行列一动，便常看到“绅士”们穷得没有袜子，旧皮鞋中藏着一只光脚。到了今年四月，英国国库的黄金美元储备，已减至十六亿二千四百万元。在传统上，英国人认为储备减至二十亿，便是财政险象的征兆。因为坐吃山空，把这一笔传家储蓄都花光，便要整个破产了。
    为了挽救危机，今年九月初，外相贝文及财相克里浦斯，又一次远渡重洋，向华尔街的债主子设法通融。美国有钱人对英国经济问题的一贯看法，总认为英国人既穷，又不肯吃苦，量入为出，以至亏空累累。譬如在工党实行了装点门面的“公医制度”后，有些穷苦英国老百姓，也去装一个假牙，配一副眼镜。华尔街就认为这些钱是不必花的，在其控制下的美国报刊，大加宣染批评。一张刊登极广的漫画，是要英国眼科医生，把验目光用的那一张由大到小的字母表，换成字母逐渐缩小的一句话：“假如这里的眼镜不是白送，你觉得你应该到这里来吗？”因此，这一次克里浦斯到了华盛顿，大亨们便咬定要英国人束紧腰带，做出东西来换美元。秘谈六天，公布“十点计划”，含糊地说，参加会议的英美加三国，将以“更大的努力”增加英国的美元收入；肯定地说，英国“将尽可能地消除”美元在英镑区的投资障碍。此外，更有锦囊妙计一通，让克里浦斯悄悄带回英伦。九月十八日晚，克氏广播，“象夜间的贼一样地到来”（伦敦泰晤士报语）突然宣布英镑贬值，原来每镑合美金四元另八分，减成二元八角。理由是刺激英货出口，赚取更多的美元。
    　　　　劳动人民“贬值”
    “贬值”、“刺激出口”、“增加美元收入”这一串似乎很复杂的经济学名词，究竟是代表一套什么把戏？举个简单例子：英国制造的小卡车，每辆约值三百英镑。按英美货币的原来比率，在美国就卖一千二百元。如今英镑由四·○八减为二·八○比一，同一卡车，在美国只合八百四十元了。东西跌价，买主增多，出口随之增加，自然可赚更多的美元了。乍听很有道理，仔细一算却不然。英国过去要赚进二千四百美元，只需出口两部卡车。而现在要赚进这个数目，却需要卖三部卡车了。换句话说，英国汽车出口必需增加三分之一，才能捞进与过去同数的美元。若靠此来弥补大英帝国的亏空，英货销路需要增加若干倍。而美国的四大汽车公司，会乐意把顾主让给英国吗？通用、福特、凯塞、克莱斯勒等制造厂，都在相继削价求售。英国人便宜，他们一定要设法竞争抵制的，此其一。再则英国的粮食及许多工业原料，都要向美国及其控制区购买。一袋面粉，价值美金八元。过去英国只要花两英镑就可买到，贬值以后，得花五·六镑。粮食及原料涨价，其他货品当然也要涨价。尽管英镑如何贬值，英国货在海外的价格，不是又将复原了吗？
    既然如此，英镑贬值如何才能发生效用，华尔街的债主子，早有成竹在胸。美国联邦储备局的发言人，周前曾经指出三项办法：一、英政府大事削减行政经费；二、增加生产，对厂主和工人在此方面予以鼓励；三、防止生产成品赶上贬值水平。此话怎讲？减政费就是要英国停止或缩办许多大众福利事业，并压低大批公务人员的薪津。增加生产，就是要工人们加长工作时间，特别卖劲；至于厂主，多出品多赚钱，对增加生产“予以鼓励”的话，是说说好听而已。防止生产成品涨价，就是要工人们不顾粮食及其他东西如何昂贵，不求增加工资。在这一点上，工党政府早有准备了。华盛顿三国会谈的前夕，工会败类操纵下的英国职工大会第八十一届会议，便作了不增加工资的允诺。因此，英镑贬值的真正意义，是劳动人民的“贬值”。
    　　　　祖产拍卖，一律七折
    华尔街要英镑贬值，除进一步剥削英国劳动人民外，另一个意义，就是迫使大英帝国拍卖祖产，货品概打七折。“十点计划”中，明确地说过英国“将尽可能地消除”美元投资的障碍。“障碍”消除之后，美国大亨们便装着满袋美钞，大摇大摆地走进英伦及其他英属地区。原来卖四元另八分的东西，现在只要二元八角，于是买股票、买地皮，物美价廉。近东的油田，美帝已获得多数；南菲的金矿，也已开始染指，最近表现得最明显的，是在东南亚：马来亚的若干锡矿及橡树园将直接由美国公司开采；“美国熔炼公司”已获得缅甸的许多矿山开采权，洛克菲勒的“美孚公司”正在排挤缅甸石油公司；英属婆罗州西北部的油、煤、铁、森林，都由美国在经营。这一切的终极目的，是要将英伦变为美国联邦的第四十九州，篡夺英国一切海外利益，把英国人民完全置于华尔街的治下。
    　　　　血中毒，找蛇医
    英国经济危机如此深重，真是没有救药了吗？不然。国家财政问题虽然繁，平衡收支，还是脱不出“开源节流”一句老话。如何开源？得老老实实做生意，以有易无。社会主义的苏联，有大宗粮食可以出口；东欧新民主主义的国家，在大力建设中，正需要多少机器及工业品；创业伊始的新中国，也愿意在平等的基础上和英国做生意。但是工党政府却放弃了这些好主顾，跟着华尔街，制造冷战，筑起东西欧贸易的壁垒。一九四八年度英国与东欧的贸易总数，减至一九三八年的百分之四十八。在东方，放弃了自己外交的独立，跟在美帝背后，反对中国人民。美帝想用经济封锁扼死世界上的进步政权，结果搬砖打脚，头号帮手大英帝国受了重伤。贝文及克里浦斯，抛开正当生意不做，去找华尔街三番五次地举债。但是资本主义的制度，决定了剥削与赚钱是债主们永远的、唯一的目的。不论英国对华尔街的政策多末效忠执行，大亨们也不会认朋友，真帮忙。结果正如血中毒，找蛇医，死路一条。
    平衡收支的另一方面，是节流。看看大英帝国的支出罢。一九四九至一九五○年度，预计国防费用是七亿六千万镑；上一年度公布数目，是六亿九千二百万镑，实际上比此为多。以今年度数目论，每个英国人的军费负担合十五镑多。按旧英美货币比率合美金六十余元。本文先曾提到英国平均每人每年的亏空是四十一美元。这个数目用国防费来弥补已经绰绰有裕了。当然一个国家不能完全没有军费，但是除了决心跟华尔街疯狂备战外，贫困的英国没有任何理由花这末多冤枉钱。在对外贸易的差额弥补上，英国因为航运发达，在海外有许多投资及银行事业，每年可赚得美元十亿。但是英国在海外的费用，据美国人的算法，达七亿五千万美元。海外如何会有这末大的支出呢？就是养兵压迫各地人民。大英帝国的军队，现在散驻于中东；西半球的洪都拉斯、牙买加、贝摩达，菲洲的大部分地区如埃及、苏彝士运河地带、黄金海岸、索马利兰等地；欧洲如象希腊；东方如马来亚、新加坡、香港，驻札的英军，数目还在不断增加。象在马来亚屠杀人民的战争里，政府承认每天花钱三万一千五百镑。据牛津统计研究所估计，英国一个五口之家每周最低限度的主要食物价格是四十八先令八便士，是则单马来亚这笔战费，便可养活八千八百多家，近于五万的穷苦英国人。这情形正象一个有早没晚的破弄户，却把钱花去买刀枪凶器，跟着一个恶棍（美帝），欺压好人。这样一来，生活当然愈成问题。
    基于上述的理由，可以断言：英国经济危机的唯一救药，就是“和平”。要和平才能与华尔街拆伙，不受债主子继续的剥削；要和平才能与世界广大的和平阵营做生意，以开财源；要和平才能去除大笔军费，以节经费。但是伪善的劳工党，死硬的保守党，都不会采用这个药方。因此，只有在和平的力量掌握英国政权后，经济困难，才会解决；日暮途穷的大不列颠，方能新生。
