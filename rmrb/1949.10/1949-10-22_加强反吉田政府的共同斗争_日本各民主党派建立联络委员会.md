　　Strengthen the Common Struggle Against the Yoshida Government
  　Japanese Democratic Parties Establish Liaison Committee
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 21st. TASS, 20th, quoting a Dentsu Agency correspondent in Tokyo, reported: Sanzo Nosaka, member of the Political Bureau of the Japanese Communist Party, told Dentsu Agency reporters that the establishment of a liaison committee for the common struggle against the anti-people Yoshida government is an important step towards the unification of democratic organizations. The Communist Party, the Labor-Farmer Party, and the Left-wing Socialist Party have established organizational ties within the liaison committee. Nosaka said: Grassroots members of democratic parties are also strengthening their struggle for unification on a local scale. Referring to the policies followed by the Japanese authorities, Nosaka spoke of the recent falsification of election results in the elections of land committees in various prefectures. The Japanese government insists that the Communist Party lost forty-four seats in these elections; in reality, the Communist Party and the groups supporting it won six new seats.
