Letter to the People of Guangdong
Dear Compatriots of Guangdong:

The People's Liberation Army has entered Guangdong. Let us mobilize and bring forth our greatest strength to welcome the People's Liberation Army, liberate all of Guangdong, and liberate all of China!

The people of Guangdong have bravely participated in the Chinese people's revolutionary war of more than twenty years, and once stood on the most glorious front lines. In the recent three years of the Liberation War, the people of Guangdong have also bravely risen up to cooperate with the National Liberation Army and waged resolute battles against the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. In the victorious struggle, they liberated 13 million people, vast rural areas, and more than 20 cities, established 100,000 people's armed forces, and created favorable conditions for the large army to liberate the entire province of Guangdong.

Dear compatriots! On the eve of the impending liberation of Guangdong with the southward advance of the large army, we should urgently mobilize to support the Liberation War, thoroughly eliminate the remaining enemies, assist in taking over the countryside and cities, establish revolutionary order, and restore and develop production. This is the current general task of the people of Guangdong.

Workers: Organize yourselves, lead the masses, and support the People's Liberation Army with unparalleled enthusiasm. Before the arrival of the People's Liberation Army, protect factories, mines, railways, highways, bridges, and machinery to prevent damage to state property. After the arrival of the People's Liberation Army, help with the takeover, eliminate the lurking forces of the reactionaries, establish revolutionary order, and restore and develop production.

Peasants: Organize yourselves to help the People's Liberation Army raise grain and grass, help with transportation, repair bridges and roads. After the liberation of the cities, transport large quantities of grain and fuel to the cities in exchange for daily necessities, so that urban and rural products can be quickly exchanged. In the countryside, resolutely eliminate bandits and special agents, carry out the struggle against local tyrants, confiscate reactionary armed forces, and develop rural production.

Revolutionary intellectuals, students, public educators, doctors, editors, reporters, scientists, and artists: Protect schools, institutions, hospitals, newspapers, news agencies, bookstores, and all scientific and artistic institutions, help with the takeover, and publicize and explain to the masses the eight-point agreement of the People's Liberation Army and the various decrees of the People's Government.

Liberal bourgeois industrialists and businessmen: Reassure yourselves and conduct business as usual and restore production. The People's Liberation Army and the People's Government are faithfully implementing the Communist Party's urban policy and industrial and commercial policies.

Overseas Chinese: The Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army have liberated the motherland and liberated their hometowns. The long-term national-scale construction will soon begin. We hope that you can invest in the motherland with confidence, develop industry and commerce, and assist in the new democratic economic construction, so that the motherland can achieve complete independence politically and economically.

In addition, we would especially like to remind the officers and soldiers who are still in the remnant army of the Kuomintang reactionaries that the people have definitely won the struggle between revolution and counter-revolution for more than twenty years. The bandit gangs of Chiang Kai-shek, Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, Yan Xishan, etc., have been definitely defeated. Your resistance is obviously foolish and meaningless. There are not many opportunities for you to atone for your crimes by rendering meritorious service to the people. But we still give you the last chance, hoping that you will quickly break away from the Kuomintang reactionaries and stand on the side of the people. If you are still obsessed and continue to be enemies of the people, you will never escape the punishment of the people.

Dear fathers, elders, brothers and sisters of Guangdong: The People's Political Consultative Conference has been successful, the People's Republic of China has been born, and our invincible People's Liberation Army is advancing towards Guangdong and Guangxi. The imperialist aggression that was first imposed on the people of Guangdong, the feudal oppression of thousands of years, and the exploitation of bureaucratic capitalism in recent decades will all be forever eliminated from the land of Guangdong and all of China. Let us unite closely, work diligently, and build a new democratic Guangdong with adequate food and clothing.

We shout:

Give full support to the People's Liberation Army! Liberate Guangdong and Guangxi, liberate Hainan Island, liberate Taiwan, and liberate all of China!

Hail the Chinese People's Liberation Army!

Hail the People's Republic of China!

Hail the Chinese Communist Party!

Hail Chairman Mao, the leader of the Chinese people!

　　中共中央华南分局号召广东人民
    紧急动员配合解放全广东
    【新华社北京十二日电】中国共产党中央华南分局于本月一日发表“告广东人民书”，全文如下：
    告广东人民书亲爱的广东同胞们：
    人民解放军的大军已经进入广东，大家动员起来，拿出我们最大的力量迎接人民解放军，解放全广东，解放全中国！
    中国人民二十多年来的革命战争，广东人民都英勇地参加了，而且曾经站在最光荣的前线。在最近三年来的解放战争中，广东人民也英勇地起来配合全国解放军，和蒋介石匪徒进行了坚决的战斗，并在胜利的斗争中，解放了一千三百万人民，解放了广大农村和二十多个城市，建立了十万人民武装，创造了配合大军解放广东全省的有利条件。
    亲爱的同胞们！当此大军南下，广东即将全部解放的前夕，我们应该紧急的动员起来。支援解放战争，彻底扫除残敌，协助接管乡村和城市，建立革命秩序，恢复和发展生产。这是广东人民目前的总任务。
    工人们：组织起来，领导群众，以无比的热情，来支援人民解放军。在解放军未到以前，要很好地保护工厂、矿山、铁路、公路、桥梁、机器，使国家财产不受到破坏。在解放军到来以后，要帮助接管工作，肃清反动派潜伏势力，建立革命秩序，恢复和发展生产。
    农民们：组织起来，帮助解放军筹粮筹草，帮助运输，修桥补路。在城市解放后，则把大量粮食、燃料运到城市来交换回日用必需品，使城乡生产品迅速交流。在乡村中则坚决肃清土匪特务和进行反对恶霸的斗争，收缴反动武装，发展农村生产。
    革命的知识分子、学生、公教人员、医生、编辑、记者、科学家、艺术家们：很好地保护学校、机关、医院、报社、通讯社、书店及一切科学艺术机关，帮助接管工作，向群众宣传解释人民解放军的约法八章和人民政府的各项法令。
    自由资产阶级工商业家们：安心地照常营业，恢复生产。人民解放军和人民政府是忠实执行共产党的城市政策和工商业政策的。
    海外侨胞们：中国共产党人民解放军解放了祖国，解放了家乡，今后长期的全国规模的建设事业，即将开始，希望你们放心投资祖国，发展工商业，协助新民主主义经济建设，使祖国在政治上、经济上得到完全独立。
    此外，我们特别提醒至今还留在国民党反动派的残余军队中的官兵们，二十多年来革命与反革命的斗争，人民确定地胜利了。蒋介石、李宗仁、白崇禧、阎锡山等匪帮，已经确定地失败了。你们的抵抗显然是愚蠢和无意义的。你们向人民立功赎罪的机会，现在是不多了。但我们仍然给你们最后的机会，希望你们赶快脱离国民党反动派，站到人民方面来。如仍执迷不悟，继续与人民为敌，你们就决不能逃脱人民的惩处。
    亲爱的广东父老兄弟姊妹们：人民政治协商会议已经成功，中华人民共和国已经诞生，我们无敌的人民解放大军正向两广前进，历史上首先加诸广东人民的帝国主义侵略、数千年来的封建压迫和近数十年来官僚资本主义的剥削，都要从广东和全中国的土地上永远地消灭了。让我们亲密地团结，勤劳地工作，建设丰衣足食的新民主主义广东。
    我们高呼：
    全力支援人民解放军！解放两广，解放海南岛，解放台湾，解放全中国！
    中国人民解放军万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    中国人民领袖毛主席万岁！
    中国共产党中央华南分局
    　　一九四九年十月一日
