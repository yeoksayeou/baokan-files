Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 26th: The president of the Philippine Trade Union Congress, Hernandez, stated in a dispatch from TASS Manila on the 24th: "The Philippines, with a population of 19 million, now has nearly two million unemployed. Anyone can see the severity of this from the number of beggars on the streets of Philippine cities. However, none of the three candidates participating in the upcoming presidential election have any concrete plans to alleviate unemployment." He pointed out that the poverty in the Philippines is a byproduct of American economic policy. The Philippines needs machines, tractors, and industrial equipment, but Washington is talking about transporting weapons and ammunition to slaughter farmers. Consumer goods are also dumped on the Philippines on a large scale, strangling local industries. The Philippines "is bound by pre-war agreements that make it a supplier of raw materials. We sell raw materials at prices dictated by the United States and buy back finished products at American prices. This explains the unemployment and poverty of the Philippine people."

　　在美帝经济绞杀政策下　
    菲失业者近二百万人
    【新华社北京二十六日电】电通社马尼拉二十四日讯：菲律宾产业职工会大会主席赫南德兹说：“拥有人口一千九百万的菲律宾，现在有将近二百万人失业。任何人都能从菲律宾各城市街道上乞丐的数目上，看出这个严重性，但是，参加未来总统竞选的三个候选人，都没有缓和失业的任何具体计划。”他指出菲律宾的贫困，乃是美国经济政策的副产物。菲律宾需要机器、拖拉机及工业设备，但华盛顿则在谈论着运送武器弹药来屠杀农民。消费品也向菲律宾大事倾销，绞杀了本地的工业。菲律宾“被束缚于使它成为原料供给地的战前协议，我们按照美国规定的价格出售原料，而又按照美国的价格购回制成品。这就说明了菲律宾人民的失业和贫困的原因。”
