　　Mother's Instructions
    Liu Fang
    Child! I tell you:
    You are no longer just your mother's
    treasure.
    I have handed you over to Chairman Mao,
    To let you learn from him, to follow him
    along the way.
　
    Child! Let me tell you:
    There is only one truth,
    Which belongs to the people,
    More than that are all false.
　
    Child! I can only tell you this
    little bit,
    I don't know about the other things.
    You can pluck up your courage and be brave,
    Learn from Chairman Mao, learn from the workers and peasants.
　
    Child! Whose children are not loved by someone,
    I must make good arrangements for you;
    Not for my sake, but for you
    the second generation.
    I must point out a bright future for you!

　　妈妈的叮咛
    刘芳
    孩子！我告诉你：
    你已不是妈妈个人的宝
    宝。
    我已把你交给了毛主席，
    让你跟着他学，跟着他
    走。
　
    孩子！让我跟你说：
    真理只有一个，
    是属于人民的，
    多了都是假的。
　
    孩子！我只能告诉你这一
    点点，
    其他我就不清楚了。
    你可以鼓起勇气壮起胆，
    向毛主席学习，向工农学
    习。
　
    孩子！谁的儿女谁不爱，
    我得好好对你有个安排；
    不是为了我，而是为了你
    们第二代。
    我得指给你一个光明的未
    来！
