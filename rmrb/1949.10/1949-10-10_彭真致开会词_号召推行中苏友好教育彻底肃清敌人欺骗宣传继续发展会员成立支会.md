　　Peng Zhen Delivers Opening Address
    Calling for the Promotion of Sino-Soviet Friendship Education, Thorough Elimination of Enemy Deceptive Propaganda, Continued Development of Membership, and Establishment of Branches
    After the congress played the national anthems of China and the Soviet Union, it elected a presidium of thirty-two people, including Peng Zhen, Nie Rongzhen, Zhang Xiruo, Zhang Youyu, Zhao Zhensheng, Yu Xinqing, Han Zhuoru, Xu Deheng, and Qian Duansheng. Peng Zhen delivered the opening address at the congress. In his speech, he pointed out that the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, since its preparation, has become one of the largest mass organizations in Beijing, which shows that the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples has a deep foundation, and this friendship cannot be shaken by any instigation, alienation, slander, or destruction by Chinese and foreign reactionaries. He emphasized that learning from the Soviet Union and strengthening Sino-Soviet friendship and cooperation is the highest interest of the Chinese people. Undermining Sino-Soviet friendship is harming the interests of the Chinese people. He pointed out that the general task of the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association is to connect Chinese and Soviet cultures and introduce the Soviet Union's various work experiences, especially in economic and cultural construction. The current specific tasks are: (1) To widely carry out education on Sino-Soviet friendship and thoroughly eliminate the residual influence of various deceptive propaganda of the enemy; (2) To continue to develop membership; (3) To establish branches in various factories, schools, and departments, with each branch having personnel specifically responsible for association affairs; (4) To launch a movement to learn Russian; (5) To establish a large number of libraries and reading rooms to introduce Soviet newspapers, magazines, and books; (6) To organize performances of Soviet films, songs, dances, and dramas. Next, Zhang Youyu, Deputy Mayor of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, spoke. He said: The success of the Chinese people's liberation movement, the victory of the revolution, and the current construction are all the result of the greatest assistance from the Soviet Union. Now and in the future, construction work will require even more help from Soviet friends. He warned everyone: The enemies of the Chinese and Soviet peoples, the imperialists and Kuomintang reactionaries, will do everything possible to undermine the unity and friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples. Therefore, on the one hand, we must greatly publicize Sino-Soviet friendly relations, and on the other hand, we must strike at the enemies who undermine Sino-Soviet friendly relations.

　　彭真致开会词
    号召推行中苏友好教育彻底肃清敌人欺骗宣传继续发展会员成立支会
    大会在奏中苏两国国歌后，选出了彭真、聂荣臻、张奚若、张友渔、赵振声、余心清、韩卓儒、许德珩、钱端升等三十二人为主席团。大会由彭真致开幕词。他在讲话中指出北京市中苏友好协会自筹备以来，到目前已成为京市最大的群众团体之一，这说明了中苏两国人民的友谊是有深厚的基础的，这种友谊是任何中外反动派的挑拨、离间、诬蔑、破坏所不能动摇的。他着重指出：学习苏联，加强中苏友谊与合作，就是中国人民最高的利益。破坏中苏友好就是危害中国人民的利益。他指出北京市中苏友好协会总的任务是沟通中苏两国文化，介绍苏联各种工作经验，特别是经济、文化建设上的经验。当前的具体的工作是：（一）广泛进行中苏友好的教育，彻底肃清敌人的各种欺骗宣传所残留的影响；（二）继续发展会员；（三）在各工厂、各学校、各部门成立分会、支会，每个分会、支会要有专门负责会务的工作人员；（四）开展学习俄文运动；（五）大量设立图书馆、阅览室，介绍苏联报纸杂志和书籍；（六）组织苏联的电影、歌舞、戏剧的演出。接着由北京市人民政府副市长张友渔讲话。他说：中国人民解放运动的成功、革命的胜利，以及目前的建设，都是由于得到苏联最大的帮助的结果。现在和将来的建设工作，更需要苏联友人的帮助。他警告大家说：中苏人民的敌人，帝国主义者和国民党反动派是要尽一切力量来破坏中苏人民的团结友爱的。因此，我们一方面要大大地宣传中苏友好关系，一方面要打击破坏中苏友好关系的敌人。
