He also raised the issues that the Higher Education Committee continued to discover or have not yet resolved in the implementation process, such as the curriculum reform of science, engineering, medicine, and the permanent administrative organization of various schools, which should be left to the newly established Higher Education Committee to continue to study and seek solutions. Vice Chairmen Zhang Xiruo and Qian Junrui, and Secretary-General Zhang Zonglin made some supplementary comments on the work of the Higher Education Committee: for example, the agricultural colleges of Peking University, Tsinghua University, and North China University were merged to form the Agricultural University, and Shanxi University was strengthened.

  董必武在报告中指出五个月来高教会的工作，是取得了一定成绩的，尤其是学制课程改革方面，给其他解放区的高教机构以有价值的参考；他又提出高教会在实施过程中所继续发现或尚未解决的问题，如理工学医的课程改革问题，各校永久性的行政组织问题等，要留交即将成立的新高教会来继续研究，寻求解决。副主任委员张奚若、钱俊瑞，秘书长张宗麟关于高教会工作又提出了一些补充：如合并北大、清华、华大三校的农学院，成立了农业大学，加强了山西大学等。全体委员热烈讨论并一致通过了董主任委员所提出的工作总结报告，华北高教会正式结束。会后全体摄影留念。  　（金凤）
