Soviet Economic Construction
    ——Speech Sponsored by the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association on the Evening of September 11, 1949 at 7:00 PM
    Professor Fan Hong

    Comrades, Ladies and Gentlemen:

    Today, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has asked me to talk about the issue of Soviet economic construction. The achievements of Soviet economic construction are magnificent. These achievements are not only related to the happiness of the Soviet people, but also have a close relationship with the people of the world.

    Today, as we discuss Soviet economic construction, we should recall the severity of World War II. During World War II, our powerful enemies, fascist Germany, Japan, and Italy, possessed such great strength that, by 1942, they threatened the survival of all mankind. If it were not for the Soviet Union's strong economic power to resist and defeat fascist Germany and Japan at that time, we would still be living in some unknown hell today! How could we be enjoying the happiness of peace today! Therefore, the victory of Soviet economic construction is also our victory. We should thank the Soviet Union for being able to begin economic construction today.

    Let us first look at the achievements of Soviet economic construction in defeating fascist Germany, Italy, and Japan. In 1938, all capitalist countries in the world, except Germany, were experiencing a decline in industrial production. Only Germany's industry was leaping forward. Since Hitler came to power in Germany, he turned production towards military purposes and actively prepared for war. By 1938, production had increased by 20 percent. At the same time, the United States' production in 1938 actually decreased compared to 1929. The production index fell from 100 in 1929 to 81. At this time, Britain's industrial production was also suffering from the unemployment of approximately one million workers. It was at this time that Hitler was about to launch the war. Who could truly resist him?

    The only country with the real strength to resist Germany was the Soviet Union. When the Great Patriotic War began in 1940, the Soviet Union, due to the success of several Five-Year Plans, had already made significant progress in industrial production. The total output of large-scale industry increased 11.7 times compared to 1913. The machinery manufacturing and metal industries in large-scale industry increased 41 times, and the high-grade arms industry—the foundation of ordnance manufacturing—increased 80 times. The production of the automobile industry, tractor manufacturing, rubber, lead, magnesium, etc., had made great progress. These industries did not exist in the old Russia.

    Let us take another look at the industry of old Russia. In 1913, during World War I, Russia ranked only fifth in the world in industry. According to Kazakevich's statistics, in 1913, the industrial output of old Russia was: electricity production was only one-seventeenth of that of the United States at the time, and one-fifth of that of Germany; pig iron was only one-eleventh of that of the United States, one-eighth of that of Germany or Great Britain, and one-quarter of that of France; steel was only one-eleventh of that of the United States, one-eighth of that of Germany, one-sixth of that of Great Britain, and one-quarter of that of France; the chemical industry and machinery manufacturing industry were almost nonexistent. From this, we can see how backward the old Russian production methods were, and how great the achievements of Stalin's plan were! The success of Soviet economic construction guaranteed the victory in the war against fascist Germany. Therefore, the Soviet Union's defeat of fascism was not only a military victory, but also an economic victory.

    In the second year after Germany launched the war, it had almost occupied all of Europe. At that time, in addition to Germany's own industry, it also had the industry of the occupied countries, and its economic power was very strong. But it was finally defeated by the Soviet Union. Therefore, some people say that the Soviet Union's defeat of Germany was due to the Allied Lend-Lease Act. But that is not the case. Because at that time, the materials lent to the Soviet Union by the Allies at their peak only accounted for 4 percent of Soviet industrial production. Therefore, the Soviet Union's defeat of fascism was undoubtedly due to the success of its economic construction.

    Since the end of World War II, the United States has been the only capitalist country in the first place. However, since the end of 1948, the United States has been experiencing an economic panic, with overproduction, declining productivity, and the scope of worker unemployment has expanded from industrial production to agricultural production. The number of unemployed workers reached six million last month. Now, any American, whether progressive or conservative, has felt the seriousness of the economic panic. The industry in Britain has not yet been able to recover to the level before World War II—that is, the level of production in 1938.

    On the other hand, the Soviet Union's industry and agriculture are advancing by leaps and bounds. According to experts, the average daily industrial production in the Soviet Union in June 1949 had even exceeded the production volume in 1940 by 41 percent. According to the Soviet Union's post-war Five-Year Plan, industrial production in 1950 should exceed that of 1940 by 48 percent. In other words, the Soviet Union's post-war Five-Year Plan was completed in four years.

    The Soviet Union is currently experiencing a shortage of workers, so many overseas Chinese in China returned to their motherland last year to participate in production. In the United States, the unemployment situation is so serious that it is estimated that the number of unemployed will reach nine to ten million by the end of this year.

    So we must ask: Why has Soviet economic construction achieved such success? Why did the United States, such a first-class industrial country, suddenly experience an earth-shattering economic panic after a brief period of wartime prosperity?

    The reason is very simple.

    Because the Soviet Union is a socialist country, the main means of production are publicly owned—owned by the state or by collective farms. In the United States, the main means of production are owned by capitalists. They have the right to control it, and the state cannot interfere.

    In the Soviet Union, because the main means of production are publicly owned, it is possible to implement a planned economic system. That is to say, production is designed and planned by the state. The plan is based on needs, and the market will not have problems. We can divide production into two categories: one is the production of the means of production, and the other is the production of consumer goods. The former can be roughly represented by industrial production, and the latter can be roughly represented by agricultural production. Industrial production provides farmers with machinery, and agricultural production provides workers with food and raw materials. Under a planned economy, the machines produced in the industrial sector, except for those retained by the department itself, are exactly the machines needed by the agricultural sector. At the same time, the food and raw materials produced by the agricultural sector, except for a portion retained by the department itself, are exactly what the industrial sector needs. Because these two mutual needs are planned well in advance by the state planning agencies, there is absolutely no possibility of mismatched supply and demand. Moreover, the total selling price of the two is also determined in advance, and they must be equal. Therefore, under a planned economy, there is absolutely no possibility of a lack of effective demand. This guarantees the unlimited expansion of the Soviet economy without any fear of panic.

    But in capitalist countries, production is blind. Industrial and agricultural production, no one knows how much is needed. Once purchasing power decreases, production is excessive, and the market cannot accommodate it, a panic will occur immediately.

    Therefore, a planned economy is the main reason for the success of Soviet economic construction. Moreover, the fundamental reason why the Soviet Union can adopt a planned economy lies in the public ownership of the means of production. The right to use and the benefits of the means of production belong to the state, and then the state can use it according to plan. In the Soviet Union, because those who do not work shall not eat, that is, labor is for the laborers themselves, the people's labor morale is very high. In the United States, because those who do not work enjoy blessings, and those who work suffer, the real workers will suffer from unemployment, hunger, and death when panic strikes. Who is willing to work so hard to provide those who do not work with a luxurious life? Therefore, the labor morale of Americans is low and weak. It is impossible for so many labor heroes to appear in the United States as in the Soviet Union.

    In the United States, the wages paid to workers account for only a small portion of the total national gross income, about 30 to 40 percent. Most of the rest falls into the hands of big capitalists. Although these big capitalists live extremely luxurious lives, they obviously cannot consume so much. Therefore, the foreign policy of the United States must be to expand overseas and plunder colonies. The Soviet Union's economic construction and production system, due to the lack of surplus in production and exchange, not only guarantees the stability of the Soviet economy, but also guarantees the Soviet Union's peaceful policy. It does not need to invade other countries.

    There is no doubt that China's economic construction will follow the path of the Soviet Union in the future. If we follow the path of the United States, will we not also invite our own panic, the hunger of our people, and invade our neighbors, weak nations such as Vietnam and Korea? We have no other path today, and other paths will even lead to the death of our Chinese nation. Chairman Mao said in his July 1st declaration: "The CPSU has won. Under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin, they can not only make revolution, but also build. They have already built a great, glorious, and brilliant socialist country. The CPSU is our best teacher, and we must learn from the CPSU."

　　苏联经济建设
    ——一九四九年九月十一日晚七时中苏友协主办讲演会上
    樊弘教授讲
    各位同志，各位先生：
    今天中苏友好协会要我来谈谈苏联经济建设问题。苏联经济建设的成就是很伟大的。这个成就不仅是关于苏联一国人民的幸福，同时它也和全世界的人民有着切身的关系。
    今天我们在这里讲苏联经济建设，我们应当回忆到第二次世界大战的严重性。在第二次世界大战中，我们强大的敌人法西斯德国、日本、意大利，它们的力量是那样大，一九四二年，已经威胁到全世界人类的生存。假若那时没有苏联强大的经济力量来抵抗并打垮法西斯德国和日本，我们今天正还不知道在那层地狱里过日子！我们今天哪能享受和平的幸福！所以苏联经济建设的胜利，也是我们的胜利。我们今天能够开始经济建设，应当感谢苏联。
    我们先从打垮法西斯德、意、日一事来看苏联经济建设的成就。一九三八年，全世界的资本主义国家，除了德国以外，在工业生产上都在衰退。只有德国的工业正在跃进。德国自希特勒执政以来，把生产转向军事，积极备战，到一九三八年生产增加了百分之二十。同时的美国，一九三八年比一九二九年的生产反而减少，生产指数从一九二九年的一百减到八十一。英国此时工业的生产也正遭受着几约百万工人的失业。正在这个时候，希特勒便要发动战争了。谁能够真正的抵抗它呢？
    真正有实力来抵抗德国的，只有苏联。苏联在一九四○年卫国战争开始的时候，因为已有几个五年计划的成功，工业生产已经有了长足的进步。大工业的总生产比较一九一三年增加到一一·七倍，大工业中机器制造业、金属工业增加到四一倍，上等辗金业——军械制造的基础增加到八十倍。汽车工业拖拉机制造业、橡皮、铅、镁等的生产都有极大的进步。这些工业在旧俄时代都是没有的。
    我们再来看一看旧俄的工业。一九一三年第一次世界大战时，俄国在世界上工业只占第五位。据卡扎克维奇的统计，一九一三年旧俄工业：电力生产只有当时美国十七分之一，德国五分之一；生铁只有美国十一分之一，德国或大不列颠的八分之一，法国的四分之一；钢铁只有美国的十一分之一，德国的八分之一，大不列颠的六分之一，法国的四分之一，化学工业和机器制造业几乎是没有的。由此可见，旧俄生产方法的落后，及斯大林计划的成果是多么伟大！苏联经济建设的成功，保证了对法西斯德国战争的胜利。所以苏联之击破法西斯，不仅是军事的胜利，而且是经济的胜利。
    在德国发动战争的第二年，它几乎占领了全部的欧洲。那时除了德国本身的工业外，更加上被占领国家的工业，它在经济上力量是很强大的。但它终于为苏联所打垮。因此有人就说：苏联的打败德国，是由于同盟国租借法案的结果。但事实上不是那回事。因为当时同盟国租借给苏联的物资，最高点只有苏联工业生产的百分之四。所以苏联打败了法西斯，是由其经济建设的成功，是无疑义的。
    自第二次世界大战结束以后，在资本主义国家中，占第一位只有美国了。但美国从一九四八年底开始，已经造成了经济恐慌，生产品已过剩，生产力已在下降，工人失业的范围已经从工业生产扩展到农业生产。失业工人的数字上个月已经达到了六百万。现在任何一个美国人，不论它进步也好，保守也好，都已经感觉到经济恐慌的严重。英国的工业至今也尚未能恢复第二次世界大战前的水平——即一九三八年生产的水平。
    而在另一方面，苏联的工业、农业都在大步地前进。据专家报告，苏联一九四九年六月份工业生产，每天平均的生产量，甚至已超过了一九四○年生产量的百分之四十一。按照苏联战后五年计划，一九五○年的工业生产，应超过一九四○年的百分之四十八。也就是说苏联的战后五年计划于四年内就完成了。
    苏联目前感到工人缺乏，所以去年在华的华侨多已返回祖国参加生产。而在美国失业情形则是如此的严重，据估计在今年年内失业人数将达九百万至一千万。
    那么我们要问：为什么苏联经济建设能有这样的成就？为什么美国这样头等的工业国家，只于经过一个短促的战时繁荣之后，突然又发生天崩地裂的经济恐慌呢？
    理由很简单。
    因为苏联是社会主义国家，主要生产手段是公有的——国家所有，或集体农庄所有。而在美国，主要生产手段是资本家所有。他对它有支配权，国家是不能干涉的。
    在苏联因为主要生产手段公有之故，乃有可能实现计划经济制度。即是说由国家设计计划而生产。计划是依需要而定的，市场不会发生问题的。我们可以把生产分为两类：一类是生产生产工具的生产，一类是生产消费物品的生产。前者大概可以用工业生产来代表，后者大概可以农业生产来代表。工业生产供给农民以机器，农业生产供给工人以粮食与原料。在计划经济之下，在工业部门内生产的机器，除本部门留用者外，所余下来的机器，恰为农业部门所需要的机器。同时农业部门所生产的粮食与原料，除本部门留用一部粮食外，所余下的粮食与原料，又恰为工业部门所需要。因为这两个相互的需要，早在事前便由国家的计划机关规定得好好的，绝对没有供需不相投合的可能。而且两者的总卖价亦是在事先决定好了的，他俩必须相等。因此在计划经济下，也就绝无有效需要缺乏的可能。这样便保证了苏联经济的无限制的扩大，不会感到任何的恐慌。
    但在资本主义国家内，生产是盲目的。工业与农业生产谁也不知道需要是多少，一旦购买力降低了，生产过剩了，市场无法容纳，立刻就会发生恐慌。
    所以计划经济是苏联经济建设成功的主要原因。又苏联之可以采用计划经济，其根本的原因在于生产手段的公有。生产手段的使用权和收益属于国家了，然后国家才能依照计划使用它。在苏联因为不劳动者不得食，即劳动是为了劳动者自己，因此人民的劳动情绪是很高的。在美国因为不劳动者享福，劳动者受罪，真正的劳动者在恐慌袭来的时候反而要受失业饥饿和死亡的打击。谁愿那样卖劲劳动去供给那些不劳动者过奢华的生活？所以美国人劳动情绪是低落的、薄弱的，象在苏联那样多的劳动英雄出现，在美国是不可能的。
    在美国，支付劳动者的工资，只占全部国民毛收入的一小部分，约在百分之三四左右。其他大部分是落在大资本家的手中。这些大资本家虽然是过着极尽奢侈的生活，但他们显然还消费不了这么多。因此美国的外交政策，便一定是要向海外扩张，掠取殖民地。而苏联的经济建设和生产制度，由于生产交换的无剩余，它不仅保证了苏联经济的稳定，而且也保证了苏联的和平政策。它不需侵略别个国家。
    我们中国的经济建设，无疑义的将来要走苏联的道路。如果我们走了美国的道路，不是也要招致了我们自身的恐慌，国内人民的饥饿，并向我们的邻人弱小的民族如越南、朝鲜等侵略吗？我们今天没有别的道路，别的道路甚至要导向我们中国民族的死灭。毛主席七一宣言内曾说：“联共是胜利了，在列宁和斯大林领导之下，他们不但会革命，也会建设。他们已经建设起来了一个伟大的光辉灿烂的社会主义国家。联共就是我们最好的先生，我们必须向联共学习。”
