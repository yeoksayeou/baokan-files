　　Discussing Specific Steps for Land Reform
  　Beijing Peasant Representatives Conference to be Held by District
  　Village Cadres and Activists Will Be Trained
    [Our Newspaper] The Beijing suburban cadres expansion meeting concluded on the 17th. Currently, each district is actively discussing Comrade Peng Zhen's report and the summary of Comrade Chai Zemin, Secretary of the Suburban Committee, from the conference. Everyone unanimously felt that Comrade Peng Zhen's speech more thoroughly resolved the ideological problems existing in everyone's mind. In the future, in land reform, we must follow the direction they have indicated.
    The peasant representative conferences in each district will also be held within days. District 13 plans to hold it for seven days, with 187 representatives participating; District 18 is preparing to hold it for five days, with 90 representatives attending. In total, the suburban area has eight districts, producing approximately 1,000 representatives. At this peasant representative conference in each district, the main focus will be on discussing and learning the suburban land reform policies and class division, and in conjunction with the actual situation, studying how to complete the land reform work.
    This suburban land reform will be carried out in three batches. The suburban area has a total of eight districts and 260 administrative villages (including 1,654 natural villages). The first batch will consist of 60 villages, and the second and third batches will each consist of 81 villages. It is expected to be completed before the spring plowing next year to facilitate spring production. (Leng Lin)
    [Beijing News] The district committees of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China are running training classes for village cadres and active peasant elements in each village, preparing for the suburban land reform work. The training classes are being led by the district party secretaries of each suburban district, convening active peasant elements and village cadres in the villages to organize training, mainly to deeply study the instructions of Comrade Peng Zhen, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, on suburban land reform work, and Comrade Chai Zemin's summary report at the Suburban Committee's expanded cadre meeting. The study period is approximately five days. After the study is completed, the suburban land reform work will commence.
