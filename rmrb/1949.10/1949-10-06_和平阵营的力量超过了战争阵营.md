The news of the selfless struggles of the heroic defenders of the cause of peace against the warmongers is coming in every day. There is now no corner of the earth where this sacred struggle is not taking place.

In the minds of tens of thousands of honest working people—patriots of all countries—there exists the great, noble, and truly peace-loving thought. This thought has formed a huge material force that not only frightens the new world war instigators, but can also resolutely suppress them. The sure evidence of this triumphant thought is that peace-loving people are increasingly recognizing their position and role in today's and future events, and are defending their freedom, independence, and national sovereignty with the utmost determination, thus defending world peace.

The undeniable fact is that the peace camp is expanding, growing, consolidating, and increasing its ranks. This fact infuriates and frightens those who lead the war camp, those who believe that only launching a world war is the "way to salvation" for a capitalism nearing its demise. An American professor, Robinson, admitted in "Foreign Affairs" magazine: "Our main weakness is now... in the realm of ideology, not in the production of goods and guns..." The "thought" talked about in the bankrupt American imperialist propaganda—the mad "thought" of ruling the world—is rejected by people all over the world. The American warmongers are trying to make their humanity-destroying "thoughts" more "legitimate," or even add the help of guns to "support" them. The North Atlantic Treaty and the recently announced White House bill to equip Marshall Plan countries with American destruction technology—nearly $1.5 billion in the first phase—the "core" of these events lies in this.

Contradictions exist between the imperialist camp headed by the United States. The approach of an economic crisis of unprecedented proportions has further strengthened these contradictions. In the search for "salvation," the heads of the war camp are stirring up military hysteria, preparing for wars of aggression. Peace—is what they fear the most. They cannot even hide this.

"In order to support the passage of the 'Military Foreign Aid' bill, it is necessary to stir up a movement of military hysteria," the American magazine "U.S. News" wrote. Sir Boyd Orr, a disciple of Churchill, said more openly: "If, by some miracle, peace prevails in the world, and people no longer need to arm and stop producing weapons, then our economic system will suffer an overly huge setback."

In other words, aggressive, plundering, and robber wars, or frenzied preparations for war—only under this unique situation, as the lackeys of capitalism believe, can dying capitalism exist "without setbacks." The current American leaders, towards this terrible, cannibalistic goal, are using a huge amount of money on the arms race and promoting war hysteria, while entrusting the helm of the government to a group of military adventurers.

The American monopoly capitalists spent $21 billion in the anti-Soviet "Cold War," but did not achieve the desired results, and therefore became even more angry.

In the people's struggle for lasting peace, the most diverse social strata participate. A huge group of Christian pastors with 35 million American members, and the American Farm Federation, which unites more than 500,000 members, have united to oppose Truman's arms bill. At the same time, among the warriors for peace, in Mexico we see two former presidents—Cárdenas and Camacho, in addition to the famous Mexican poet Marquina and the workers of the American factory "Light and Pavel" factory—all this is not accidental!

The struggle of the people all over the world for peace has achieved great successes, and at the same time, this struggle is not only expanding, but is also gradually taking the offensive. According to the report of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace, seventy-one countries are now participating in the broad movement for peace, and this movement is constantly rising. Under these circumstances, the committee believes that it is necessary and appropriate to declare October 2 as the Day of Struggle for Peace, and to hold a review of the fighting forces of the entire peace camp.

The World Congress of Supporters of Peace has made outstanding achievements. The grand review of progressive youth organizations around the world held in Budapest, Hungary, and the American Congress of Supporters of Peace held in Mexico, have written new pages in the glorious history of the people's struggle against warmongers.

The victorious socialist country, in front of all mankind, is already the well-known most determined and solid fortress of peace, and the safe fortress of the people who hate war and are unwilling to walk into the yoke of imperialist enslavement. The determined, fierce, principled and successful struggle waged by the Soviet patriots, led by the great champion of peace and leader of the people, Comrade Stalin, is an inspiring example and model for all those who oppose the warmongers.

Everything that happens every day clearly confirms that the camp of peace supporters is much stronger than the camp of warmongers. But in the field of striving for peace, victory does not come by itself—it must be fought for. This is why all true patriots, all frank, honest, and resolute peace supporters, need to unite more closely; more enthusiastically expose the bloody plans of American imperialism; more enthusiastically advocate the unity of peace supporters; and explain to the masses of people who demand justice that the threat of a new world disaster must be eradicated forever.

The peace camp will give full play to all its enormous strength, and it will be completely victorious; at the same time, the plans of the war camp will be completely defeated!

### 和平阵营的力量超过了战争阵营

　　和平阵营的力量超过了战争阵营
    关于英勇的和平事业的保卫者们在各处进行着的忘我的反对战争贩子斗争的事迹，每天都有一些新的消息传来。现在地球上已经没有一个角落不是在举行着这种神圣的斗争。
    在成千成万的正直的劳动人民——各国的爱国者们——的脑海里，存在着伟大的高尚的真正爱和平的思想。这种思想，已形成了一股巨大的物质力量，它不仅能使新的世界战争挑拨者们恐惧，而且还能坚决地镇压住他们。这种思想凯旋的确凿证据，即是爱和平的人民，愈来愈认清了在今天及未来事件中自己的地位及作用，并以最大的决心保卫着自己的自由、独立和民族主权，因之即是保卫着全世界的和平。
    不可争辩的事实是这样的：和平阵营扩张着、生长着、巩固着、增加着自己的行列，对于领导战争贩子阵营的人们，对于认为只有发动世界战争才是逼近灭亡的资本主义的“解救之路”的人们，这事实使得他们狂怒而恐惧。美国的一位教授罗宾逊在“外交”杂志上承认说：“我们的主要弱点，现在是……在思想意识范围，不是在商品及枪炮的生产方面，……”。破产了的美帝国主义的宣传所谈到的“思想”——统治世界的疯狂“思想”——到处受到全世界人民的摈弃。美国的战争贩子，企图使自己的毁灭人类的“思想”，变得更“合法”些，甚或加上枪炮之助来“支持”它们。北大西洋公约及不久以前白宫宣布的要以美国的毁灭技术，装备马歇尔计划国家的法案——第一期近十五亿美元——这些事件的“核心”就在于此。
    以美国为首的帝国主义者阵营之间，存在着矛盾。具有空前规模的经济危机的逼近，更加强了这些矛盾。在寻求“解救”之中，战争阵营的头子们，煽起了军事的歇斯的里，准备着侵略战争。和平——是最使他们害怕的一件事。他们甚至也不能隐瞒这一点。
    “为了支持‘军事援外’法案的通过，又必需煽起军事的歇斯的里运动。”美国的杂志“美国新闻”曾这样写过。而包依得奥尔爵士，这位邱吉尔的门徒，更公开地说道：“如果由于某种奇迹，和平支配了世界，人民即不再需要武装并停止生产武器，那么我们的经济制度，就要遭到过度巨大的挫伤。”
    换言之，侵略的、掠夺的、强盗的战争，或狂热的准备战争——只有在这种唯一的形势下，象资本主义的走卒们所相信的，垂死的资本主义才能“不受挫伤”的存在着。现在的美国首脑，即向着这可怕的、食人的目标，用于军备竞争和鼓吹战争歇斯的里上一笔巨大的款项，同时把政府的舵手，委托给了一伙军事冒险家。
    美国的独占资本家们，在进行反苏的“冷战”中，消耗了二百一十亿美元，但却没有达到需要的结果，因此就更加愤怒了。
    在人民争取持久和平的斗争中，有最不同的社会阶层参加。拥有三千五百万美国会员的基督教、牧师的庞大团体，和团结有五十多万会员的美国农场联合会，联合起来反对杜鲁门的军备法案。同时在争取和平的战士中，在墨西哥我们看到了两位从前的总统——卡敦纳斯和加玛卓，此外还有著名的墨西哥诗人玛尔金涅斯和美国工厂“拉伊特和巴维尔”工厂的工人们——这一切都不是偶然的！
    全世界人民争取和平的斗争，达到了伟大的成就，同时这斗争不仅在扩展着，而且还逐渐取得了攻势。据世界拥护和平大会常设委员会的报告，在争取和平的广泛运动中，现在已有七十一个国家参加，同时这运动还在不断地高涨着。在这种情况下，委员会认为宣布十月二日为争取和平斗争日，并举行全体和平阵营战斗力量的检阅，是必需的，是适当的。
    世界拥护和平大会的进行，得到了卓越的成就。匈京布达佩斯举行的全世界进步青年组织的大检阅，和在墨西哥举行的美洲拥护和平大会，在人民反对战争贩子的光荣斗争史上，都曾写下新的史页。
    胜利的社会主义国家，她在全人类面前，早已是众所周知的最坚决、最巩固的和平堡垒，是憎恨战争、不愿走入帝国主义奴役重轭下的人民的安全堡垒。苏维埃爱国者，由伟大的和平事业拥护者、人民的领袖斯大林同志领导着所进行的坚决的、猛烈的、原则性的和成功的斗争，对一切反对战争贩子的人们，是一个鼓舞的例子和模范。
    每天进行着的一切事件，都清析地证实了：拥护和平者的阵营，是比战争贩子的阵营强大得多。但是在争取和平的领域中，胜利不是自己走来的——必须争取它。这就是为什么一切真正爱国者，一切坦白、诚实和刚毅的和平拥护者们，需要更密切地团结起来；更热心地揭发美帝国主义的血腥计划；更热切地倡导着团结和平拥护者；要向要求正义的人民群众解释，永远根除新的世界灾难的威吓。
    和平阵营尽量发挥她的一切巨大的力量，她是会完全战胜的；同时战争阵营的计划，定会遭到彻底的崩溃！
