　　Guarantee Good Cotton Planting Next Year
　　North China Collects Cotton to Ensure Purity
　　1.5 Million Jin of Improved Seed Cotton Already Purchased
　　[Report from this newspaper] After the North China Cotton Improvement Office convened a meeting on cotton collection and purity preservation in September, various localities universally launched the work of purchasing improved seed cotton. As of around the 20th of this month, 1.5 million jin had been purchased, yielding 900,000 jin of cotton seeds. The cotton ginning factories established by the North China Cotton Improvement Office in six locations, including Tangshan and Handan, made the purchases. In Shijiazhuang, Lixian, and other places, cooperatives made the purchases and then handed them over to the cotton ginning factories for ginning. The purchasing work in various localities has implemented the spirit of the meeting on cotton collection and purity preservation. This is mainly reflected in the following aspects: First, the party and government departments at all levels have attached great importance to the work and relevant organizations have provided assistance. In general, village cadre meetings and mass meetings have been convened in each improved seed area to mobilize the masses to select good cotton and separate collections (separating the collection of superior and inferior cotton), send good seeds, and sell seed cotton to cotton ginning factories. The Langfang and Tongxian People's Governments even convened meetings of private cotton ginning factories to explain the importance of cotton collection and purity preservation. The flower and yarn divisions and sub-companies in various localities supplied public cotton ginning factories with sufficient funds. For example, the Nangong sub-company first used the grain it transported to exchange for improved seeds. Tongxian once discovered cases of individual cotton farmers adulterating cotton. In addition to explaining and criticizing them face-to-face, they were also introduced to the village government for education. This universally improved the consciousness of the masses. Second, the cotton price policy was conscientiously implemented. The price of improved seed cotton was universally increased by one grade, generally above eight jin of rice, and reaching nine and a half jin of rice in Linqing and Nangong, which is more than 10% higher than the price of ordinary cotton, improving the masses' confidence in improved seeds and encouraging them to send cotton to improved seed purchasing points. Handan purchased 250,000 jin in 20 days. The quality of this year's Type S cotton 2B, except in individual areas, generally has a lint length of more than 15/16 of an inch. Linqing, Nangong, Xiazhen, Tongxian and other places even reached one inch. Every 100 jin yields two more jin of cotton seeds than ordinary cotton. The masses around the improved seed areas universally requested the government to issue Type S cotton seeds. However, in order to further improve the work of cotton collection and purity preservation, various localities must pay attention not only to completing the purchase quantity, but more importantly, should pay attention to quality. This is the important purpose of the Cotton Improvement Office in carrying out cotton collection work, otherwise it will increase the difficulty of future improved seed promotion. Technically, the cotton inspection work should be done well before ginning, and strict separation of collection, ginning, and storage should be carried out. For the seeds retained by the masses, village cotton gins can be organized to centrally gin the cotton to avoid mixing (Tongxian has already carried out this work). Experience has shown that the work is extremely smooth wherever the local party and government leadership relies on the district and village governments to carry out the purchase. Due to the difference in the proportion of cotton and grain, various improved seed organizations can implement the flower, yarn, and cloth company's credit purchase method to make the improved seed price reach nine to nine and a half jin or more, and actively prepare for the requisition of improved seed cotton. As for the planting of good cotton in the flood-stricken areas next year, in addition to supplying some cotton seeds from other places, oil presses should gin less or no cotton seeds to avoid a cotton seed panic next year. Individual areas have the phenomenon of competing to purchase improved seeds, which should be addressed promptly.

### 保证明年种好花　华北各地收花保纯　已收购良种籽棉百五十万斤

　　保证明年种好花　
    华北各地收花保纯　
    已收购良种籽棉百五十万斤
    【本报讯】华北棉产改进处于九月召开收花保纯会议后，各地即普遍展开了良种籽棉收购工作，截至本月二十日左右，已收购了一百五十万斤，可得棉籽九十万斤。唐山、邯郸等六地由华北棉产改进处所设立的轧花厂收购，石家庄、蠡县等地则由合作社收，再交给轧花厂轧。各地的收购工作均贯彻了收花保纯会议的精神，这主要表现在下列几方面：首先是各级党、政部门的重视与有关机关的协助，各良种区一般都召开了村干部会及群众会，动员群众选良分收（将优劣棉分开收），送好种子，将籽花卖给轧花厂。廊坊、通县人民政府更召开了私营轧花厂会议，说明收花保纯的重要性。各地花纱部分、支公司供给公营轧花厂充足的资金，如南宫支公司将运到的粮食先用在换良种上。通县曾检验出个别棉农掺杂花现象，除当面解释批评外，并介绍到村政府给以教育。这样普遍提高了群众的觉悟。其次是认真执行了棉价政策，良种棉的价格普遍加一级，一般都在八斤米以上，临清、南宫达到九斤半米，比普遍花的价格高百分之十以上，提高了群众对良种的信心，将花踊跃送往良种收购处，邯郸在二十天内，便收购了二十五万斤。今年斯字棉二Ｂ的质量除个别地区外，一般绒长均在一英寸的十六分之十五以上，临清、南宫、夏津、通县等地并达到一英寸。每百斤比普通花多出二斤穰子。良种区周围的群众都普遍要求政府发给斯字棉籽。但为了进一步作好收花保纯工作，各地必须注意不仅要完成收购数量，更重要的是应注意质量。这是棉产改进处进行收花工作的重要目的，否则将增加今后良种推广的困难。在技术上应在轧花前作好检花工作，严格分收、分轧、分存。群众的自留种，可组织村中轧车，集中轧花，以免混杂（通县已进行了这一工作）。经验证明，凡在当地党、政领导下依靠区村政权进行收购者，工作开展极为顺利。由于棉、粮的比例差额，各良种机构可推行花纱布公司之赊购办法，使良种价达到九斤至九斤半以上，并积极准备进行良种棉征收。至于水灾区明年良棉的种植，除他处供给一部棉籽外，油房应少轧或不轧棉籽以免明年棉籽恐慌。个别地区有争购良种现象，应及时设法解决。
