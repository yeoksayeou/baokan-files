		Explaining and Critiquing Correct and Incorrect Approaches
[Beijing News] Eighty-four primary school teachers in Beijing Municipality were approved to join the Communist Youth League. Yesterday (the 16th), the induction ceremony was held in the auditorium of Fu Jen Catholic University. Feng Wenbin, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, and others were present to give guidance. A total of two thousand people attended the meeting. The meeting was presided over by Yang Bozhen, Deputy Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League. He explained the significance and importance of establishing the League among primary school teachers and pointed out that after joining the League, members should faithfully and wholeheartedly serve the people, implement the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the policies of the Party. Following this, Feng Wenbin, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, delivered a speech, providing valuable opinions to primary school teachers on how to run schools well and teach students well. He first pointed out that the tasks of primary school teacher League members are: (1) to unite teachers and students, and unite the masses; (2) to be proficient in their profession and teach students well; (3) to study diligently and make continuous progress. Then, he gave detailed instructions on the issue of teaching methods: (1) It is necessary to recognize the characteristics of general primary school students: (1) The thinking of children and adolescents is not yet mature, and they are in a period of exploring knowledge in many aspects. Do not adopt restrictive or stereotypical methods, but use correct methods to guide them to pursue knowledge and interest in reading. (2) The bodies of children and adolescents have not yet developed fully and are in the process of development and change. Excessive and high demands should not be made, nor should crude and undigested political principles and profound indoctrination be used. Inappropriate attitudes towards children and adolescents will have adverse effects. (3) Psychologically, children love beautiful, novel, and realistic things, are inquisitive, and have a strong ability to imitate. (2) Criticizing three teaching methods: (1) Do not use the cramming method of instilling concepts, but use vivid and lively facts to carry out education. (2) Methods of suppression and restriction should be abolished, and corporal punishment and expulsion, among other measures, should be eliminated. (3) Adult-like and politicized methods are not suitable in primary schools. It is wrong to only talk about political terms, conduct ideological struggles, investigate class origins, and carry out class struggles. (3) Correct teaching methods are: (1) to be truthful, systematic, and thorough; (2) concreteness and generality - starting with daily, concrete, and ordinary things for education, from concrete to abstract, from shallow to deep, from individual to general; (3) diversity and liveliness - starting from children's demands, interests, and characteristics, using diverse activities and methods for education; (4) using methods of enlightenment and demonstration to cultivate conscious initiative and creativity; (5) facing children and adolescents - it is necessary to understand the personality, characteristics, psychology, and hobbies of children and adolescents in order to become good friends of primary school students. Finally, Feng Wenbin pointed out that in order to achieve the goal of teaching students well and running schools well, we must first rely on the close combination of the Education Bureau, the principal, and teachers, and be responsible to the people; and implement the new education policy administratively. Secondly, we must rely on writers, scientists, and artists to jointly undertake the work of educating children and adolescents. Third, we must rely on the organizations of the Communist Youth League, Young Pioneers, and Children's Corps in the school, and everyone should work together to realize the goal of educating a generation of children and adolescents and building a new society. At the meeting, Xue Chengye, representative of the Middle and Primary School Teachers' Union, congratulated the new League members on behalf of the Teachers' Union. Finally, the new League members took an oath in a solemn ceremony, and the Soviet film "An Ordinary Soldier" was shown.

    【北京讯】北京市小学教员八十四人被批准参加青年团，于昨（十六）日在辅仁大学礼堂举行入团仪式，青年团中央书记冯文彬等亲临指导。参加大会者共二千人。大会由北京市青年团副书记杨伯箴主席，他说明在小学教员中建团的意义和重要性，并指出入团后应忠实地全心全意为人民服务，实行人民政协的共同纲领和党的政策。继由青年团中央书记冯文彬讲话，对如何把学校办好和把学生教好，给小学教员提供了宝贵的意见。他首先指出小学教员团员的任务是：（一）团结师生、团结群众。（二）精通业务、教好学生。（三）努力学习、不继进步。接着他对教学方法问题作了详尽的指示：（一）要认识一般小学生的特点：（１）少年儿童的思想尚未成熟，正在探求多方面的知识的时期，不要采取束缚的方式和定型化，而应用正确的方法引导他们追求知识和读书的兴趣。（２）少年儿童的身体尚未发育健全，正在发育和变化中，不应作过分和过高的要求，生吞活剥的政治原则，和深奥的灌输，以及不适当态度去对待少年儿童，都会受到不良的影响。（３）在心理上，儿童都爱好美丽新奇现实的事物，好问、模仿性强。（二）批驳三种教学方法：（１）不应用填鸭式的灌输概念的方法，而应用生动活泼的事实来进行教育。（２）应取消压制、束缚的方法，废除体罚、开除等办法。（３）成人化政治化的方法，在小学里是不适合的，只讲政治名词，进行思想斗争和查阶级，进行阶级斗争等，都是不对的。（三）正确的教学方法是：（１）要真实、系统和彻底性。（２）具体性和一般性——从日常的具体而平凡的事物中着手进行教育，从具体到抽象，从浅到深，从个别到一般。（３）多样性和活泼性——从儿童的要求、兴趣和特点出发，用多种多样的活动和方式来进行教育。（４）用启示和示范的方法培养自觉自动和创作性。（５）面向少年儿童——必须了解少年儿童的个性、特点、心理和爱好，才能成为小学生的良友。最后，冯文彬指出，要达到教好学生办好学校的目的，必须首先依靠教育局、校长和教师的密切结合，对人民负责；从行政上贯彻新教育的方针。其次，依靠文学家、科学家和艺术工作者共同担负少年儿童教育的工作。第三是依靠校内青年团、少年先锋队和儿童团的组织，大家共同为实现教育少年儿童的一代，建设新社会的目标而努力。会上，中小学教联代表薛成业代表教联向新团员致贺。最后，新团员在庄严的仪式下进行宣誓，并放映苏联影片“一个普通的战士”。
