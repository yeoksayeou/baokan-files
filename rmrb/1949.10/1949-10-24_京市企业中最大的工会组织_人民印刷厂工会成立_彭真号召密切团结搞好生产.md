　　The Largest Trade Union Organization in Beijing Enterprises
  　People's Printing Factory Trade Union Established
    Peng Zhen Calls for Close Unity to Improve Production
    [Beijing News] The Beijing People's Printing Factory Trade Union was formally established yesterday (23rd), with more than 3,800 members, making it the largest trade union organization among factories and enterprises in the capital. The preparatory committee of the factory's trade union was established as early as March 9th of this year. After eight months of full preparation, it convened the first general membership representative meeting from the 21st of this month, summarizing and discussing the work of the trade union preparatory committee, formulating the charter, and electing 31 executive committee members, including Wang Ji. The founding conference was held at 9:00 am yesterday. All members and trade union committee members attended. Peng Zhen, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Nan Hanchen, General Manager of the People's Bank of China, and Xiao Ming, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, came to guide the meeting in person. Representatives of trade unions from public factories in the capital also attended to express their congratulations. After Kang Feng, Chairman of the meeting, delivered the opening speech, Wang Ji, a trade union representative, reported on the preparation process, followed by the swearing-in of the trade union executive committee members. The conference then invited guests to speak. Nan Hanchen, General Manager of the People's Bank of China, pointed out in his speech that because the working class is the leader in the country today, it is necessary to work hard with the spirit of being masters of our own affairs. The better the work and the more achievements, the more consolidated and forward-developing the country can be. The factory's only task is production, and the workers, as masters, should be masters of production, mainly by increasing quantity, improving quality, and reducing costs in the way labor heroes are masters; oppose the "good-for-nothing" master approach that only demands increased wages and improved living standards without mentioning production. Finally, he encouraged all employees to strengthen production and study hard under the leadership of the trade union to complete the great task of developing production. Xiao Ming, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, pointed out in his speech that the establishment of the Chinese People's Printing Factory Trade Union proves that only "everyone running the trade union" can further develop the factory, improve production, and improve factory management. He called on all employees to continue to strengthen unity, raise awareness, increase production and practice economy, oppose waste, and continue to report counter-revolutionaries, and strive to build a new People's Printing Factory and a new Beijing. Peng Zhen, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, was invited to speak amid warm cheers from the audience. He first congratulated the establishment of the Chinese People's Printing Factory Trade Union and the health of all employees. Comrade Peng Zhen pointed out that the production of the printing factory has generally improved and made a lot of progress. The average output of the entire factory has increased by 28%, and some units, such as the ink factory, have exceeded 100%. This shows the new atmosphere of the working class after liberation and the new atmosphere of the new China. He pointed out that today, Chinese workers should unite closely, do a good job in production, and take on the task of building a new country. As long as the employees of all our public factories unite and work together, we can do well. The fact that the People's Printing Factory was able to increase production by 28% in a short period of time is proof. You have: first, removed the reactionary element Huang Shuming and transformed the leadership; second, eliminated some counter-revolutionaries; and third, strengthened the workers' own organization—the trade union, and corrected the direction of all employees' efforts. After these efforts, production has increased. Comrade Peng Zhen called on all employees to pay attention to protecting machines, saving raw materials, and improving technology in order to improve product quality, increase output, and reduce costs. Everyone should discuss and study hard at work and come up with more ideas. Regarding the future work of the trade union, he called on the trade union to improve its organization, organize workers' political, cultural, and technical studies, improve workers' political, cultural, and technical levels, strengthen the theoretical study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, so that workers can become all-rounders, and some will study to become engineers in the future. In addition, the trade union should also vigorously carry out workers' welfare work. Finally, he called on all employees to work hard to produce and strive to build the people's capital. In the speeches of the guests, trade union representatives from more than ten units, including the Beijing Automobile Repair Factory, the Telecommunications Bureau, the North China Electric Power Company, the Tram Company, and the Yanjing Paper Mill, also delivered congratulatory messages. Everyone unanimously pointed out that in the future, the employees of all factories must unite more closely and jointly build the people's capital. After the meeting, there was a dinner and photo session, and a recreational evening was held at 7:00 pm to celebrate.
