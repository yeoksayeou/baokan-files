The Electric Tram Company of Beijing is actively carrying out the work of democratic management and is stepping up preparations for the All-Staff Representative Congress. The worker representatives from each unit have all been elected. The Management Committee of the Repair Factory has been established. The Worker Representative Congress of the Tram Line has already been convened on September 19. The All-Staff Representative Congress will be held soon, after which the Factory Management Committee can be established, and workers can formally participate in production management. Since the closing of the Provisional Staff Representative Congress on July 2, although preliminary improvements have been made in various aspects of work, the implementation of democratic management has also taken a detour. In mid-July, when the administration proposed a plan to adjust the organization and personnel to the employees, due to insufficient understanding of democratic management in the leadership's thinking and a lack of in-depth and clear publicity and explanation to the workers, it once caused fluctuations in the workers' production morale. Later, after mobilization and explanation, the workers' morale stabilized. The staff union also organized the employees into groups according to production units and the principle of voluntary association to discuss the adjustment of organizational personnel issues. In order to lay the foundation for the Staff Representative Conference and the Management Committee, at the end of July, the staff union reorganized the tram line worker member groups. All the tram line workers, except those who went out to study and those who were sick, 95 percent were organized. At the same time, the union also organized a study class for night shift tram line employees. More than 80 people participated, accounting for one-third of the number of night shifts. It played a significant role in improving workers' political awareness. By the end of August, the election of staff representatives began. Due to proper brewing in advance, everyone understood the tasks and conditions of the staff representatives, and the election was discussed by means of criticism and self-criticism of the candidates. As a result, not only were representatives who were truly supported by the masses elected, but also in the process of criticism and self-criticism, the employees' understanding of democracy was also improved. In the election, more than 85 percent participated in the voting. Now that the company's Staff Representative Congress is about to be held, the administration is drafting a responsibility system for passenger transport and other plans based on production needs and employee requirements, and the employees are also self-ordering production and saving plans, all of which are prepared to be submitted to the conference for discussion and implementation.

[Beijing News] The Beijing Municipal Workers' Joint Performance, sponsored by the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, began yesterday (the 16th) evening. More than a thousand workers and guests from various factories attended last night. Liu Ziju, Minister of Propaganda and Education of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Sha Kefu, Secretary of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, Li Leguang, Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, famous novelists Ding Ling and Zhao Shuli, poet Ke Zhongping, Li Shaoxuan, Director of the Compilation and Review Department of the Opera Improvement Association, Liu Yumin of the People's Art Troupe, Wang Songsheng, Secretary-General of the Cultural Committee of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Lin Kai of the Youth League's Literary Department, Wang Yaping of Xinmin Daily, and Miao Peishi of Workers' Daily attended as invited judges. Before the performance, Zu Tian, the person in charge of the Propaganda and Education Department of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, reported: This performance has been brewing for a month, with 16 public factories and 2 private factories participating. The forms adopted include operas, dramas, Yangko dances and clapper talks. Most of the performances are workers' own creations, reflecting the workers' enthusiasm for production. Then Ding Ling was invited to speak. She called on worker comrades to work hard to create for themselves and become real worker creators who write about themselves and perform for themselves. Subsequently, the Workers' Music Training Class of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and the Workers' Choir of the Beijing Xinhua Printing Factory sang songs, and the Workers' Amateur Troupe of the Beijing Xinhua Printing Factory, workers of the People's Printing Factory, and others performed dramas. The programs were extremely exciting, and the worker audience felt greatly encouraged and excited by the performance. After the closing ceremony, the judging committee held a brief meeting and exchanged views on the purpose of this performance and the judging criteria. They unanimously agreed that workers' creations should be widely rewarded in order to achieve mutual learning and encourage workers' cultural and artistic creation, so that workers can see that literary and artistic work can better promote and develop.

　　电车公司筹开工代大会
  　京市工人联合演出昨开始
    【北京讯】北京电车公司正积极进行管理民主化的工作，加紧筹备全体职工代表大会，现各单位的职工代表，已全部选出，修造厂管理委员会已成立，车路职工代表大会已于九月十九日召开，全体职工代表大会即将举行，今后即可成立工厂管理委员会，工人正式参加生产管理。该公司自七月二日临时职工代表大会闭幕以来，各方工作虽有初步改进，但在实行管理民主化的工作中也曾走了一段弯路。七月中旬，行政上对职工提出调整机构人事的办法时，由于领导思想上对民主管理认识不够，而又缺乏对工人进行深入明确的宣传解释，因之曾一度引起工人生产情绪的波动。后经动员解释，职工情绪才安定下来。职工会并把职工按生产单位及自愿结合的原则，编成小组，讨论调整机构人事问题。为了奠定职工代表会和管理委员会的基础，在七月末，职工会整编车路工人会员小组。车路全体工人，除了出去学习的与有病的以外，百分之九十五都组织起来了。同时，工会还组织了晚班车路员工的学习班。参加的有八十余人，占晚班人数的三分之一。对工人政治认识的提高，起了很大的作用。至八月底，开始职工代表选举。由于事先有适当的酝酿，使大家明了职工代表的任务和条件，而且选举是通过批评自我批评的方式来讨论候选人的。结果，不只是选出了真正受群众拥护的代表，而且在批评与自我批评的过程中，使职工们对民主的认识也提高了一步。在选举中，参加投票的在百分之八十五以上。现在该公司职工代表大会即将举行，行政上正在根据生产需要及职工要求拟定乘务负责制等方案，职工们也在自订生产节约计划，都准备提交大会讨论后实行。
    【北京讯】市总工会所主办的北京市工人联合演出，已于昨（十六日）晚开始。昨晚到有各工厂工人及来宾共千余人；应聘为评判员的全国总工会宣教部长刘子久，全国文协秘书长沙可夫，中共北京市委会宣传部副部长李乐光，名小说家丁玲、赵树理，诗人柯仲平，戏曲改进会编审处处长李绍萱，人民文工团刘郁民，中共北京市委文委秘书长王松声，青委文艺部林凯，新民报王亚平，工人日报苗培时等二十余人出席。演出之前，首由市总工会宣教部负责人祖田报告：这次演出，曾经过一个月的酝酿，参加有十六个公营工厂及两个私营工厂，所采形式有歌剧、话剧、秧歌舞及快板等，演出内容大部分是工人自己的创作，反映了工人生产的热情，旋请丁玲讲话，她号召工人同志要努力锻炼为自己创作，成为写自己、演自己的真正工人创作者。继由市总工会工人音乐训练班、北京新华印刷厂工人歌咏队演唱歌曲，北京新华印刷厂工人业余剧团、人民印刷厂工人等演剧，节目极为精彩，工人观众对此次演出感到极大的鼓励与兴奋。闭幕后，评判委员会作一简短集会，对此次演出目的及评判标准等问题均交换了意，一致认为应普遍奖励工人创作，以达到互相观摩和鼓励工人文化艺术创作之目的，使工人见文艺工作能更好的推动与开展。
