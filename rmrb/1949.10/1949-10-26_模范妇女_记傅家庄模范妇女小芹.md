Model Woman
    ——A Record of Xiaoqin, a Model Woman from Fujiazhuang
    Zhong Ling
    Girl,
    You labor in the grain pile,
    Covered in chaff;
    Shovel after shovel,
    Sounding strong,
    It sounds so powerful.

    Several women in the field,
    Are also in your group;
    Like you,
    Joy is for all of you.

    Plow, rake, planter, hoe,
    You can do them all,
    Many young men are envious;
    Good girl!
    Only seventeen this year.

    Older brother went to join the army,
    Father is old,
    Mother relies on you.
    Good military family, relying on yourself,
    You learned how to raise crops.

    Women's mutual aid group,
    Is led by you;
    Although you are young,
    They all support you.

    You often tell everyone:
    "We peasants have turned over,
    First we rely on the Communist Party,
    Second, we rely on production!"

    Girl,
    You understand the truth,
    Women are learning from you;
    Even the older mothers,
    Don't call you Xiaoqin,
    They all call you a model woman!
    —September in Nangong

　　模范妇女
    ——记傅家庄模范妇女小芹
    钟铃
    姑娘，
    你劳动在谷堆里，
    披着谷皮；
    一锨一锨，
    格朗格朗地，
    听起来是多有力。
　
    场上几个妇女，
    也跟你在一组；
    象你一样，
    愉快是你们大家的。
　
    犁、耙、耩、锄，
    你都会做，
    多少小伙子都眼气；
    好姑娘呵！
    今年才十七。
　
    哥哥参军去，
    爹老了，
    娘指望你。
    好军属，靠自己，
    你学会了养种地。
　
    妇女互助组，
    是你领导的；
    你虽年青，
    她们都拥护你。
　
    你常跟大家说：
    “咱农民翻身，
    头一个靠共产党，
    再一个就靠生产！”
　
    姑娘，
    你懂得了真理，
    妇女都跟你学习；
    连那上年岁的老妈妈，
    也不喊你小芹，
    都称你模范妇女！
