　　Teacher and Students Talk About the CPPCC
　　(Wang Shengchuan, Lü Chengyi, Shuncheng Street Elementary School, 7th District)
　　Student: What does the CPPCC do? Who participates in it?
　　Teacher: The people participating in the conference include workers, farmers, combat heroes, labor heroes, women, student representatives, ethnic minorities, overseas Chinese, the Communist Party, democratic parties, non-party democrats, etc. In short, except for the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique, bureaucratic bourgeoisie, and landlord class, all have representatives participating. These representatives, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, will jointly discuss how to build China into a prosperous and strong country, establish a central people's government, carry the revolution through to the end, build factories and run schools well so that the people's lives will get better day by day.
　　Student: Teacher! Why didn't we hold this conference earlier? Wouldn't we have overthrown Chiang Kai-shek sooner?
　　Teacher: After Japan surrendered, the people of the whole country originally wanted to live in peace, become prosperous, and build a new China. Who knew that Chiang Kai-shek, this traitor, single-mindedly wanted to eliminate the people's army—the People's Liberation Army, and wanted to eliminate the Chinese Communist Party, which represents the people's interests. Chiang Kai-shek sold China's great rivers and mountains to American imperialism. American imperialism supplied Chiang Kai-shek with cannons and airplanes to kill the Chinese people. In order to liberate the Chinese people, Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu overthrew the Kuomintang government and established a government of the people. For three years, they commanded the Chinese People's Liberation Army to carry out a difficult war of liberation. Today, we have crossed the Yangtze River and entered Guangdong. All of China is about to be completely liberated. Therefore, today's CPPCC meeting is being held under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, with the PLA bravely eliminating the reactionaries and achieving a basic victory. With this foundation, it is possible to convene this truly democratic CPPCC meeting.
　　Student: This is really a great happy event, much happier than celebrating the New Year. Chiang Kai-shek will never be able to come to Beijing again. The people of Beijing will never be oppressed again, and have truly stood up.
　　(On the afternoon of September 26, workers, students, teachers, and staff in the 7th District happily participated in the parade celebrating the CPPCC. The parade started from Qianmen, passed through Dongjiaomin Lane, East and West Chang'an Street, and then from Rongxian Hutong to Qianmen. This parade was long enough for twenty li, and no one was heard to say they were tired.)
　　Teacher: Are the students tired?
　　Student: No! Not tired at all. We have never been so happy. When we marched to Dongjiaomin Lane, the students shouted at the top of their voices: "Down with imperialism!" "Adhere to the people's democratic dictatorship!" "Unite with international friends!" Teacher! We are really happy!
　　Teacher: Why are you so happy?
　　Student: When we shouted "Down with imperialism" in Dongjiaomin Lane, it felt as free and pleasant as swimming in water. Who dared to take a trip to Dongjiaomin Lane in the past? Before Beijing was liberated, an American soldier raped Beijing University student Shen Chong in Beijing. It is said that the American soldier was declared innocent in the United States. Chiang Kai-shek didn't even dare to ask his American father about it. Today, we have stood up and become masters...
　　Teacher: Students! Your enthusiasm and hatred for imperialism are very good, but it would be wrong to think that all foreigners are bad, because workers and farmers all over the world are one family, and workers and farmers all over the world are oppressed by imperialism. We want to overthrow American imperialism, we want to unite with the American people. Only by uniting with the people of the world can we defeat imperialism. We not only shout "Long live Chairman Mao!" but also "Long live Stalin!" because they, like Chairman Mao, are leaders of the people.
　　Student: Teacher, we understand. The Communist Parties all over the world are the same as the Chinese Communist Party. Foreign countries also have reactionaries who harm the people, just like China, and have Chairman Mao who leads the people.

　　师生谈政协
    （七区顺城街小学王胜川吕成仪）
    学生：政协会是干什么的？都是谁们参加？
    老师：参加会的人：有工人，农民，战斗英雄，劳动英雄，妇女，学生代表，少数民族，华侨，共产党，民主党派，无党派民主人士等。总之，除了蒋介石反动派匪帮，官僚资产阶级，地主阶级外，都有代表参加。这些代表都在毛主席的领导下，共同商量，如何把中国建设成富强的国家，成立中央人民政府，把革命进行到底，好好的修工厂办学校使人民的生活一天天好起来。
    学生：老师！为什么早不开这个会，早开不早把蒋介石打倒了吗？
    老师：日本投降后，全国人民本想过安生日子，发家致富，建设新中国，谁知道蒋介石这个卖国贼，一心一意想消灭老百姓的队伍——解放军，想消灭代表人民利益的中国共产党。蒋介石把中国的大好河山，出卖给美帝国主义，美帝国主义供给蒋介石大炮飞机杀中国人民。毛主席朱总司令为了解放中国人民，把国民党政府推倒，建立人民自己的政府，三年来，指挥中国人民解放军进行了艰苦的解放战争。今天我们打过了长江，进入了广东，全中国马上要完全解放。所以今天的政协会议是在毛主席英明领导下，解放军英勇消灭了反动派，取得了基本胜利。有了这个基础，才可能召开这个真正民主的政协会。
    学生：这真是个大喜事，比过新年要欢喜的多，蒋介石永远不能来北京了。北京人民永远不受压迫了，是真翻了身。
    （九月二十六号下午，七区的工人、学生、教员、工作人员都高兴的参加了庆祝政协的游行，游行从前门开始，经过东西交民巷，东西长安街，又从绒线胡同到前门，这足够二十里路的游行，没有听到一个人说累。）
    老师：同学们累不累？
    学生：不！一点也不累，我们从来没有这样高兴过。我们游行到东交民巷时，同学们放大了嗓子喊着：“打倒帝国主义！”“坚持人民民主专政！”“团结国际友人！”老师！我们真高兴！
    老师：你们为什么这样高兴呢？
    学生：我们在东交民巷喊打倒帝国主义，好象在水里游泳似的自由愉快。过去谁敢到东交民巷走一趟？北京未解放时，美国兵在北京强奸北大学生沈崇，听说那个美国兵在美国宣告无罪了，蒋介石连问都不敢问他美国爸爸一下。今天咱们翻身啦，当了主人啦……
    老师：同学们！你们这样热情，对帝国主义的痛恨是很好的，但若认为外国人都不好便错误了，因为天下的工人农民是一家，天下工人农民都受帝国主义压迫。我们要打倒美国的帝国主义，我们要团结美国的人民，只有和全世界人民团结起来，才能战胜帝国主义。我们不但喊毛主席万岁！还要喊斯大林万岁！因为他们和毛主席一样是人民的领袖。
    学生：老师我们明白了，全世界的共产党和中国共产党一样，外国也和中国一样有害人民的反动派，有领导人民的毛主席。
