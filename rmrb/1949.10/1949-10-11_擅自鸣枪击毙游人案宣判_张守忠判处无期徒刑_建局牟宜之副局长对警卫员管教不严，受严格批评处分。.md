[News from this city] Zhang Shouchong, the guard of Mou Yizhi, Deputy Director of the Beijing Construction Bureau, who shot and killed tourist Han Zhaoying in Beihai Park on the evening of the 17th of last month, has been brought to a conclusion after interrogation by the Military Law Department of the Beijing Military Control Commission. Zhang Shouchong was sentenced to life imprisonment, and his Zalaide pistol, wooden gun case, and four bullets were confiscated. The verdict of the Military Law Department stated: "The defendant, as a guard, abandoned his post and illegally interrogated pedestrians, firing a gun without authorization, resulting in the death of a tourist. This poses a great danger to public welfare and the safety of tourists' lives. Such disregard for discipline and violation of military orders, resulting in the serious consequence of killing a person, is difficult to forgive. In order to maintain revolutionary discipline and protect the safety of people's lives, a severe punishment of life imprisonment is imposed." In addition, regarding the deceased's burial and the consolation of the deceased's family, the municipal government ordered the Construction Bureau to handle it properly after the incident. In addition to purchasing a coffin, burial garments, and paying 241,000 yuan for mortuary expenses, a consolation fee of 400,000 yuan was given to the family. As for Deputy Director Mou Yizhi's failure to strictly supervise his guard, the Municipal Government Affairs Conference has decided to give him a severe criticism.
