　　Mass Literary and Art Workers Unite
    To Welcome the High Tide of Cultural Construction
    Li Xunfeng
    The Beijing Mass Literary and Art Creation Research Association, initiated and organized by progressive elements of mass literary and art workers in Beijing, has officially and smoothly produced the heads of the executive committee and various departments after two consecutive member congresses, in addition to passing the articles of association. This is an unprecedented great unity that we mass literary and art workers have never had in history, and this unity symbolizes the infinite bright future of our mass literature and art!
    The attendees of this member congress included all mass literary and art workers: from authors of episodic novels, playwrights and actors of operas, storytelling artists, to cross-talk performers, everything. Especially valuable is that many factory literary and art cadres have enthusiastically joined our ranks, which really makes us see the brilliant and radiant future of our mass literature and art even more!
    Originally, in the old semi-colonial and semi-feudal Chinese society in the past, none of us mass literary and art workers were not poor friends who suffered exploitation and persecution and struggled on the line of life. When we went to all corners of the old society, we were even more despised and insulted everywhere, and we were not treated as human beings. Since opera singers were called "actors," storytellers and cross-talk performers were regarded as "begging for a living," and even our so-called writers who wrote episodic novels and sold manuscripts for a living seemed to be indifferent to the world in the old society and claimed to be aloof; however, they were also given a nickname, called "literary beggars"! In short: whether it is "actors," "begging for a living," or "literary beggars," they are all roundabout, inseparable from a straightforward term, that is, "beggars"! That's right, we don't have a single room or a single piece of land, and everyone is engaged in their own profession, but we want to shout out in the new Chinese society under the leadership of the vanguard of the proletariat—the Chinese Communist Party—where the people's liberation war has laid a completely victorious foundation: "We will no longer serve the 'masters,' no longer be the 'masters' pastime; we, a group of 'beggars,' have stood up, we have turned over!"
    In the past, we suffered cruel persecution from the ruling class, forcing us to write what we didn't want to write, sing what we didn't want to sing, and laugh when we didn't want to laugh. In order to get half a bowl of leftovers from the "masters" and maintain our worthless lives, we endured humiliation and lived like years, doing work that we shouldn't have done. At that time, the pain in our hearts could not be described in words. Today, the liberation of the whole of China is just around the corner; we can no longer be forced by livelihood like in the past, saying things against our will, forcing ourselves to be happy, and writing articles that please the "world," performing obscene operas, and asking the "masters" for "appreciation"; the strong barrier built by the reactionary forces between us and the people has been shattered! We have the broad masses of the people in front of us, as our ready-made objects! From now on, we have no more worries, and we can freely write what we want to write and perform what we want to perform in front of the broad masses of the people. In other words: we are now the literary and art workers of the masses of the people; those who love us are the broad masses of the people. We see that many factory literary and art cadres have joined our ranks, which makes us imagine that countless people suffering from spiritual hunger are raising their hands high, urgently needing us to give them spiritual food. We must unite with the broad masses of the people.
    Chairman Mao made it clear in his opening speech at the People's Political Consultative Conference: "With the arrival of the high tide of economic construction, a high tide of cultural construction will inevitably appear," which shows how important the task facing us today is! Because we are mass literary and art workers, we are the vanguard on the front line of cultural construction! The quality of cultural construction depends largely on our mass literary and art workers!
    Let us unite, learn together, study together, and produce more mass literature and art to meet the needs of the broad masses of the people and welcome the high tide of cultural construction!

　　大众文艺工作者团结起来　
    迎接文化建设的高潮
    李薰风
    由北京大众文艺工作者的进步分子所发起组织的北京市大众文艺创作研究会，经过两次连续的会员大会，除通过会章外，执行委员会和各部会的负责人选都已正式的顺利产生了。这是我们从事大众文艺工作者在历史上所没有的一个空前大团结，这团结，象征着我们大众文艺未来前途上的无限光明！
    这一次会员大会的出席者是包括了整个从事大众文艺的工作者：从章回体小说的作者，戏曲的编者和演员，评书艺员，以至于说相声者，无所不有。尤其最难得的，是许多工厂文艺干部都热烈的参加到我们的行列，这真使我们越发的看到我们大众文艺前途的灿烂辉煌，光芒万丈！
    本来我们大众文艺工作者在过去的半殖民地，半封建的中国旧社会里，大家没有一个不是受尽剥削，迫害，挣扎于生活线上的穷苦朋友。而我们走到旧社会的各个角落，更是到处受着轻视与侮辱，并不拿我们当人来看待。唱戏的既然被称为“戏子”，说评书，说相声的又被目为“吃格念的”，就是我们写章回体小说，卖稿为生的所谓作家，好象是在旧社会里与世无争，自命为清高了；可是，也被给了一个绰号，叫做“文丐”！总而言之：“戏子”也罢，“吃格念的”也罢，“文丐”也罢，那都是拐弯抹角，离不开一个直捷了当的名词，就是“要饭的”！不错，我们房无一间，地无一垄，大家都是指身为业的人，但是，我们要在今天无产阶级的先锋队——中国共产党领导下，人民解放战争业已奠定完全胜利的基础的新中国社会里，高喊一声：“我们不再伺候‘老爷’们，不再做‘老爷’的消遣品了；我们这一群‘要饭的’站起来了，我们翻身了！”
    在过去，我们曾经饱受到统治阶级的残酷迫害，使我们不写要写，不唱要唱，不笑要笑。为了讨得“老爷”们半碗剩饭吃，维持我们一条不值钱的性命，我们曾经忍辱含垢，度日如年，干了我们所不应当干的工作。那时候我们内心的苦痛，真不是笔墨和言语可以形容。今天呢，全中国解放就在眼前了；我们不能再象过去那样的迫于生计，言不由衷，乐不由己，做一些媚“世”的文章，演一些淫乱的戏曲，向“老爷”们请求“欣赏”了；反动势力给我们和人民中间建筑起来的一道坚强障碍已经粉碎了！我们有了广大的人民，在我们眼前，做我们现成的对象了！从今以后，我们再没有什么顾虑，可以自由自在的在广大人民面前，写我们所要写的东西，演我们所要演的戏曲了。换一句话说：我们今后是人民大众的文艺工作者了；热爱着我们的，也就是广大的人民。我们看到这多位工厂文艺干部都参加我们的行列中来，这就使我们可以想象到无量数受着精神上饥渴的人民都在高举着双手，迫切的需要我们给予精神上的食粮。我们要和广大的人民打成一片。
    毛主席在人民政治协商会议开幕词上，讲的明白：“随着经济建设的高潮到来，不可避免的将要出现一个文化建设的高潮”，这足可见在今天面临到我们头上的任务是如何的重大！因为我们是大众文艺工作者，我们是站在文化建设的第一线上的一枝尖兵！文化建设的如何，我们大众文艺工作者是负着一大部分责任的！
    让我们团结起来，共同学习，共同研究，多多产生大众的文艺，以满足广大人民的要求，迎接文化建设的高潮吧！
