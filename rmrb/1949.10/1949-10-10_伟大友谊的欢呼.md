　　As the Soviet delegation entered the west gate of Peking University, cheers erupted like a storm from the ranks of Peking University students lined up on both sides. Many students, holding books such as "The Young Guard" and "Days and Nights," surged forward to ask the original authors for autographs. Everyone enthusiastically lifted the Soviet friends up, shouting "Stalin, hurrah!" Red and green paper flowers and strips were scattered over the Soviet friends from the ranks on both sides. Many students had tears of joy and gratitude glistening in their eyes, their whole bodies trembling with excitement as they jumped and cheered. When the Soviet delegation entered the venue—Democracy Square—the entire audience of 20,000 young students and cadres expressed their boundless respect and welcome to the Soviet friends. Hats, clothes, and bags were thrown into the air, and applause and cheers filled the venue, shaking the hearts of everyone present. The great friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people was firmly forged in the hearts of the younger generation.
　　Since the October Revolution, the new Soviet culture has had a profound and widespread influence on the broad Chinese cultural circles, especially among young intellectuals, nurturing the cultural seedlings of New China. In the past, reactionary forces had constantly used guns, police, and prisons to deprive young people of the opportunity to accept progressive ideas and literature and art. However, Marxist-Leninist books were still widely disseminated among truth-loving and indomitable Chinese youth, and the works of Soviet writers have always been favored by the vast number of Chinese youth. Socialist ideas and literature and art guided Chinese youth to embark on the revolutionary road of combining with the working people, and constantly encouraged Chinese youth to wage heroic and resolute struggles against the reactionary dark rule. Under the broad and profound influence of Soviet culture, Chinese youth have grown stronger and more robust. Everyone longed for the day when they could shake hands and cheer with Soviet friends to express our gratitude and friendship. Today, at the birth of the People's China, this opportunity has finally arrived. The enthusiasm and cheers of friendship, long suppressed in the hearts of Chinese youth, erupted, uniting the people of China and the Soviet Union closely under the common great ideals of mankind.

　　伟大友谊的欢呼
    当苏联代表团步入北大西校门时，欢呼象风暴一样从排列在两旁的北大同学行列中爆发出来，许多同学拿了“青年近卫军”、“日日夜夜”等书拥上去请原著者签名。大家热情迸发地把苏联友人举起来，高呼“斯大林，乌拉！”红绿的纸花和纸条从两旁的行列中洒满在苏联友人的身上，许多同学眼中闪耀着欣喜与感谢的泪光，全身激动着不断地跳跃和欢呼。苏联代表团步入会场——民主广场——时，全场两万青年学生与干部表示了对于苏联友人无比的敬爱与欢迎，帽子、衣服、书包都抛到半空，掌声与欢呼充满了会场，震撼着每一个人的心灵，中苏人民伟大的友谊在青年一代的心中牢固地熔结了。
    十月革命以后，苏联的新文化就一直在广大的中国文化界尤其是青年知识分子中想着深刻广泛的影响，孕育着新中国的文化幼苗。过去在长期中反动派曾经不断地有用枪杆、宪警和牢狱来剥夺青年人接受进步的思想与文艺的机会，但是马列主义的书籍仍然在热爱真理而倔强的中国青年群中广泛传布，苏联作家的作品一直为广大的中国青年所喜好。社会主义的思潮与文艺指引着中国青年走上与劳动人民结合的革命道路，不断鼓舞着中国青年向反动的黑暗统治作英勇坚决的斗争。在苏联文化的广泛而深刻的影响下，中国青年成长得更加坚强而茁壮了，大家都渴望着有这么一天能和苏联的友人尽情的握手欢呼，表示我们的感谢与友情。今天在人民中国诞生的时候，这个机会终于来了，长期地抑藏在中国青年心中的友谊的热情与欢呼爆发出来，将中苏两国人民在共同的伟大的人类的理想下紧紧地团结起来。
