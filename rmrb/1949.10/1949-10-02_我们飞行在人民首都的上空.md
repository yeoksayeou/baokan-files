　　We Fly Over the People's Capital

　　On October 1st – the great birthday of the People's Republic of China, we arrived at a certain base of the Chinese People's Air Force to participate in the People's Air Force's review flight.

　　On the vast airfield, rows of silver, green, and gray airplanes were neatly arranged on both sides of the runway. All the planes were freshly painted: the noses were red, and the bodies and wings were uniformly decorated with red stars with golden-yellow borders, and the tails were red and white stripes. These airplanes were all American-made; during the People's Liberation War, some were flown by air force heroes who defected, and some were captured by the People's Liberation Army ground forces, and now they have all become the people's own weapons. When we arrived at the airport, the pilots of the People's Air Force were full of energy, ready to go, preparing to participate in the grand military parade celebrating the birth of the People's Republic of China.

　　The command issued the order to "Prepare to move out," and the sound of thunderous engines immediately resounded across the airfield. The first team of airplanes lightly swept across the runway. At this moment, the dark clouds had just dispersed, and the sun shone golden rays from the clouds, and the airplanes cut through the clouds and took off. Ten minutes later, the one we were in also ascended into the air. The pilot of this airplane was a young and handsome young man surnamed Wang. He was flying a brand-new airplane that he had flown over when he defected this spring. He was about to accept the solemn review of the people's leaders Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu over the people's capital. He excitedly assured everyone that he would resolutely complete this glorious flight mission today.

　　The airplanes all arrived at the designated assembly point. The squadron waited for orders to enter the airspace over Beijing. The small squadron circled peacefully. The fighter planes flew past beside and above us. At 4:20, the command issued the order to advance. Two green airplanes swept past from our upper left corner, and we followed closely, heading west along the railway. Everyone on the plane became nervous, and the photographers aimed their lenses, waiting for the great scene. At 4:30, Beijing appeared before our eyes. Glazed tile palaces, red walls and gates, and orderly streets – this solemn people's capital, covered in red flags today, appeared even more solemn and beautiful. The camera clicked, Tiananmen Square appeared below the wing, and countless red flags and a sea of black heads of people merged into one. The armored units on the ground were slowly marching in front of the rostrum. The roar of the engine filled the airspace over the people's capital. From a bird's-eye view, only the crowd was swaying. "Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu must have seen us!" Everyone thought so, hoping that the squadron could circle over Beijing again. But this was not within the prescribed review procedure, so we had to fly to the airport. When we landed back on the original runway, the squadron leader ran over and told the pilot comrades, "Our team was neat and mighty, and won the enthusiastic cheers of the people of Beijing!"

　　我们飞行在人民首都的上空
    在十月一日——中华人民共和国伟大的诞生日，我们到了中国人民空军某基地，去参加人民空军的检阅飞行。
    在辽阔的机场上，一排排银色的、绿色的、灰色的飞机，整整齐齐的排列在跑道的两旁。所有飞机都油饰一新：机头是红色的，机身和翅膀上一律饰以镶金黄色边的红星，机尾是红白相间的条纹。这些飞机都是美国货，在人民解放战争中，有的被空军健儿驾驶起义，有的经人民解放军地面部队所俘虏，现在已全部变为人民自己的武器。当我们到达机场的时候，人民空军的飞行员正精神奕奕，整装待发，准备参加庆祝中华人民共和国诞生的隆重阅兵典礼。
    指挥部下达了“准备出动”的命令，机场上立刻响起雷霆万钧的马达声音，第一队飞机轻快地划过跑道。这时，天空阴云新散，太阳从云朵中射出金光，飞机划破云层腾空而起。十分钟以后，我们乘坐的一架也升到空中。这架飞机飞行员是一个姓王的年青英俊的小伙子，他驾着自己在今春起义时飞来的全新的飞机，要在人民的首都上空接受人民领袖毛主席、朱总司令庄严的检阅，他兴奋地向大家保证：今天一定坚决完成这一光荣的飞行任务。
    飞机都到了指定的集合点。机群等待命令进入北京上空。小队的机群安详地转着圈儿。驱逐机在我们的旁边和上空飞腾而过。四点二十分指挥部发出前进的命令，两架绿色飞机从我们的左上角掠过，我们紧紧跟着，沿铁路西进。机上每一个人的神经都紧张起来，摄影的同志对准镜头，等待着伟大的场面。四点三十分，北京出现在我们眼前。琉璃瓦的宫殿，红色的墙门，整齐的街道，这庄严的人民首都，今天被红色的旗帜所掩盖，愈加显得庄严美丽了。摄影机响了，天安门出现在机翼下面，数不清的红旗和黑压压的人群连成一片，地面的装甲部队正缓缓行进在司令台前。发动机的震响充满了人民首都的上空，从空中鸟瞰，只见人群晃动。“毛主席和朱总司令一定见到我们了！”大家心里都这样想，希望机群能再往北京上空转一回。但是这不在检阅程序规定之内，我们只得奔飞机场而去了。当我们又降落到原来的跑道上时，大队长赶紧跑来告诉飞行员同志们，“我们的队伍整齐威武，赢得了北京人民的热烈欢呼”！（附图片）
    年青的人民空军，首次列队飞越首都上空，向伟大领袖毛主席、朱总司令致敬。
