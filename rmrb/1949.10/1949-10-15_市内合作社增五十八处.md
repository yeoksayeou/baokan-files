【Beijing News】 In August and September, the Beijing Municipal General Supply and Marketing Cooperative implemented the resolution of the All-Circles Representative Conference on developing cooperative undertakings. In addition to consolidating and expanding the original cooperatives, it also systematically established 37 street cooperatives, 3 worker cooperatives, 16 agency and school cooperatives, and 2 production cooperatives (excluding suburban areas). The number of members increased by 76,726, an increase of 41 percent compared to before the All-Circles Representative Conference. The vast majority of these members are workers from various district porter unions. In the suburbs, offices have been established in the four districts of Thirteen, Fifteen, Sixteen, and Seventeen, which previously had no cooperative organizations. The main business is to develop rural supply and marketing and to guide the work of rural cooperatives. In addition, in order to solve the problem of winter coal use for members, cooperatives have been mobilized to set up their own coal briquette factories. As of the end of September, cooperatives in the city have established 20 coal briquette factories (excluding suburban areas), of which 12 are dedicated to processing and production for the General Cooperative, with an average daily production of 246,000 catties of coal briquettes.

　　市内合作社增五十八处
    【北京讯】京市供销合作总社八、九两月来执行各界代表会议关于发展合作社事业的决议，除巩固与扩大原有的合作社外，并有计划地建立了三十七个街道合作社，三个职工合作社，十六个机关学校合作社，和二个生产合作社（郊区除外），增加社员七万六千七百二十六人，比各界代表会举行前增加了百分之四十一。其中社员绝大多数为各区搬运工会工人。郊区方面已在过去没有合作社机构的十三、十五、十六、十七四个区，分别建立办事处，主要业务是开展农村供销与领导农村社的工作。此外，为了解决社员冬季用煤起见，动员各合作社自设煤球工厂，截至九月底止，全市合作社已建立了二十个煤球厂（郊区在外），其中有十二个专为总社加工生产，平均每天可生产煤球二十四万六千斤。
