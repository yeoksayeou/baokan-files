Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 30th: The Shenyang Municipal People's Government Public Security Organs have detained and are trying American national Wald and others for assault. After the news of American national Wald and others brutally assaulting Chinese worker Ji Yuheng spread, public outrage was ignited, and all sectors gathered and sent letters to the Northeast Daily to express serious protests, demanding that the People's Government promptly arrest and severely punish all the perpetrators according to the law. The Shenyang Municipal People's Government Public Security Organs immediately, based on the accusations of all Chinese workers and staff at 38 Sanjing Road (former US Consulate in Shenyang), summoned the principal and accessory offenders: American national Wald, German national Klittan, Italian national Sicni, American-Japanese national Isojiro, and American Reberg, a total of five people. However, the offenders showed no remorse for their criminal act of assault, but instead denied it in every way. Especially the principal offender, Wald, dared to appear in the courtroom of the People's Public Security Organs with the arrogant and cunning attitude of an imperialist during the preliminary hearing. The Public Security Organs immediately detained them for transfer to the court for trial.

Also, the righteous action of protesting the assault incident by American national Wald and extending condolences to the injured worker Ji Yuheng has rapidly spread to various parts of Northeast China. The Northeast Daily has continuously received a large number of condolence letters, condolence money, and a large number of protest letters against Wald. The protest letters unanimously demanded the prompt punishment of Wald and other murderers. The Northeast Federation of Trade Unions issued a statement on the 26th, representing all workers in Northeast China to express their sincere condolences to Ji Yuheng, and supported the People's Government in punishing the murderers headed by Wald according to the law. The Shenyang Municipal Democratic Women's Federation also issued a protest letter on the same day, stating: From this incident, the women of Shenyang have more clearly recognized the true face of American imperialism in its rampant bullying and humiliation of the Chinese people. After hearing the news, workers in Jinzhou City, Liaoxi Province, and Harbin City and Mudanjiang City, Songjiang Province, also held meetings to express serious protests against the brutal behavior of American imperialist elements and expressed warm condolences to the injured worker Ji Yuheng. All Chinese workers at the former US Consulate in Shenyang, while jointly issuing a letter of accusation, have announced a strike, stating that they will not resume work until this case is reasonably resolved.
