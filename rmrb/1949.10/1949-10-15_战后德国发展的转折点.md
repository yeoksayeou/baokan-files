    Turning Point in Post-War German Development

    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 14th] TASS Moscow, 12th: The latest issue of New Times published an editorial on the turning point in post-war German development, stating: The proclamation of the German Democratic Republic and the establishment of the Provisional Government of the German Democratic Republic are events of historical significance. The American and British imperialists believed that a Germany dismembered and divided by them would not have the strength to resist their disastrous policies. They committed the error that imperialists often make—failing to take into account the German people. The establishment of the German Democratic Republic means that the German people will no longer tolerate the Western countries' heinous policies of undermining Germany's sovereignty and independence and threatening the survival of its nation. As a result of the establishment of the German Democratic Republic, the struggle for a unified and democratic Germany has entered a new stage. Naturally, the German people will have to make their utmost efforts to carry this struggle through to the end. It would be naive to think that the Western countries will cease their anti-peace and dangerous conspiracies or no longer obstruct the reconstruction of democratic Germany. However, the progressive forces within the country are currently uniting around the German Democratic Republic, and they are armed with a militant action program—the National Front. The German Provisional Government is a powerful factor in the struggle for Germany's democratic unification and national independence, and for lasting peace in Europe.

    战后德国发展的转折点
    【新华社北京十四日电】塔斯社莫斯科十二日讯：最近一期的新时代发表社论论战后德国发展的转折点称：宣布德意志民主共和国和德意志民主共和国临时政府的成立，是具有历史意义的事件。美英帝国主义以为被他们所肢解和分割的德国不会有能够对抗其灾难性政策的力量。他们犯帝国主义所常犯的错误——没有考虑到德国的人民。德意志民主共和国的成立意味着德国人民不再容忍西方国家破坏德国的主权和独立并威胁其民族的生存的罪恶政策了。由于德意志民主共和国的成立，争取统一民主德国的斗争已进入了一个新的阶段。自然，德国人民把这一斗争坚持到底，还需要尽最大的努力。如果认为西方国家会停止反和平的危险阴谋或不再妨碍民主德国的重建工作，这就太幼稚了。但目前国内的进步力量正围绕着德国民主共和国而团结起来，他们为战斗性的行动纲领——全国阵线——所武装起来。德国临时政府对于为德国的民主统一和民族独立、为欧洲持久和平的斗争是一种有力的因素。
