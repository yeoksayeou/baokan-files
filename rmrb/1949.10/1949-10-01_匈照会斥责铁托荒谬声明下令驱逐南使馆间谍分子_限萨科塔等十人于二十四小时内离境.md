　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 30th: According to the Hungarian News Agency in Budapest, the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs delivered a note to the Yugoslav Legation in Budapest on the 26th, expelling ten espionage agents from the Yugoslav Legation in Hungary and refuting Tito's note, stating: During the trial of the Hungarian traitor Rajk and his accomplices for treason, it has been proven that the leading figures of the current Yugoslav government, as instigators and organizers, participated in a conspiracy aimed at subverting the Hungarian People's Republic, assassinating Hungarian political leaders, restoring capitalist rule, and fascism. They had long been serving the imperialists. The current Yugoslav Minister of Internal Affairs, Ranković, illegally crossed the Hungarian border in October 1948, met with Rajk in Bács, and instructed him to overthrow the Hungarian government through an armed coup, assassinating Rákosi, Farkas, and Gerő. In order to carry out the assassination, Ranković dispatched assassins Ivanović and Ujkić to Budapest under the guise of diplomatic personnel. The leaders of the current Yugoslav government promised Rajk armed assistance and military intervention, and for this purpose, provoked many bloody incidents. Personnel from the Yugoslav Legation in Budapest organized espionage networks throughout Hungarian territory and handed over the received intelligence to personnel from the US and British diplomatic missions and military delegations engaged in espionage activities. The Yugoslav Legation in Hungary became the center of conspiracies to overthrow the Hungarian government by force. The Hungarian government has decided to eliminate this intolerable situation, expel ten members of the Yugoslav Legation, including Sakota, and order them to leave Hungary within 24 hours.
    The note refutes Tito's note to Hungary and the statement, saying: Based on proven facts, the Hungarian government believes that the current Yugoslav government regarded the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance between Yugoslavia and Hungary, signed in December 1947, as a scrap of paper from the very beginning, because the Yugoslav government had been organizing conspiracies against Hungarian democracy long before the signing of the treaty. The Hungarian government resolutely rejects the absurd statements made by the current Yugoslav Prime Minister Tito in the note given to the Hungarian Minister in Belgrade on September 24th of this year. In the economic and trade agreements signed between Yugoslavia and Hungary in 1947, Hungary made significant sacrifices, agreeing to a major reorganization of Hungarian industry and agreeing to invest huge sums of assets for the benefit of Yugoslavia's five-year plan. The Hungarian government could not have known at that time that Yugoslavia had concluded these agreements for the benefit of imperialism and with a hidden purpose of weakening the Hungarian economy. Hungarian government and Workers' Party leaders visited Yugoslav leaders several times from 1945 to 1948, and at that time, Hungarian leaders were, of course, unaware that the Yugoslav leadership core had betrayed its own people and was pursuing a two-faced policy. The Yugoslav government cites the previous expressions of friendship towards Yugoslavia made by Hungarian political leaders as evidence, but from the Yugoslav government's insistence on a hypocritical policy of friendship towards Hungary, this citation is hypocritical and ridiculous. Hungarian political leaders do not deny their previous statements about the heroism shown by the Yugoslav people in the war against German fascism, but they distinguish between the heroic Yugoslav people and those current leaders who betrayed the people and threw Yugoslavia into the arms of imperialism. The slanders against the Soviet Union in the Yugoslav note of September 24th also show that the current Yugoslav leaders are the vanguard of the warmongers. The trial in Budapest has proven that even as Soviet troops were shedding blood to liberate Yugoslavia, agents of the current Yugoslav leaders, such as Romba, were already colluding with American intelligence organizations and dispatching Zornji to Hungary to engage in espionage activities against the Soviet army.

　　匈照会斥责铁托荒谬声明下令驱逐南使馆间谍分子
    限萨科塔等十人于二十四小时内离境
    【新华社北京三十日电】据塔斯社引匈牙利通讯社布达佩斯讯：匈牙利外交部二十六日致南斯拉夫驻布达佩斯公使馆照会一件，驱逐南驻匈公使馆十名间谍分子出境，并驳斥铁托照会说：在对匈牙利卖国贼拉伊克及其同谋者叛国案的审讯中，业已证明南斯拉夫现政府的首要人物作为煽动者与组织者参加了目的在于颠覆匈牙利人民共和国、谋杀匈牙利的政治领袖、恢复资本家政权和法西斯主义的阴谋，他们许久以前就已经为帝国主义者服务。南斯拉夫现任内政部长兰科维奇于一九四八年十月曾非法越匈牙利边界，在巴克斯城会见拉伊克，并训令他以武装政变来推翻匈牙利政府，谋杀拉科西、法卡斯和格罗。为了进行暗杀，兰科维奇派遣刺客伊凡诺维奇和尤伊基奇以外交人员身份进入布达佩斯。南斯拉夫现政府领袖答允给拉伊克武装援助和军事干涉，且为此目的而挑起了许多血腥事件。南斯拉夫驻布达佩斯公使馆人员在匈牙利领土内四处组织间谍网，并把收到的谍报交给进行谍报工作的美英外交使团和军事代表团人员。南斯拉夫驻匈公使馆成为组织武力推翻匈牙利政权的阴谋中心。匈牙利政府决定消除这不可容忍的状态，驱逐南公使馆人员萨科塔等十人，限令二十四小时内离开匈境。
    照会驳斥铁托致匈照会及声明称：基于业已证明的事实，匈牙利政府认为南斯拉夫现政府在一九四七年十二月签订南匈友好合作互助条约时，即已把这条约视同废纸，因为南斯拉夫政府早在签约很久以前就已在组织反对匈牙利民主的阴谋了。匈牙利政府坚决拒斥本年九月廿四日南斯拉夫现总理铁托在交给匈牙利驻贝尔格莱德公使的照会时所作的荒谬声明。一九四七年南匈两国签订的经济与贸易协定中，匈牙利作了重大牺牲，同意匈牙利工业大大改组，同意为了南斯拉夫五年计划的利益进行巨额资产投资。匈牙利政府那时还不能知道南斯拉夫缔结这些协定竟是为了帝国主义利益并怀着一个削弱匈牙利经济的不可告人的目的的。匈牙利政府和工人党领袖曾在一九四五到一九四八年数次访问南斯拉夫领袖，当时匈牙利领袖当然还不知道南斯拉夫领导核心背叛其本国人民并奉行着两面政策。南斯拉夫政府引证匈牙利政治领袖以前所作对南友好的表示作为证据，但是，从南斯拉夫政府坚持着对匈牙利的虚伪的友好政策看来，这种引证是虚伪可笑的。匈牙利政治领袖并不否认他们以前所作关于南斯拉夫人民在对德国法西斯主义的战争中所表现的英雄主义的言论，但他们却把英雄的南斯拉夫人民与那些背叛人民并把南斯拉夫投向帝国主义的现领袖区别开来。南斯拉夫九月二十四日照会中对苏联的诽谤，也说明了南斯拉夫现领袖是战争贩子的进攻支队。布达佩斯的审讯已证明：就在苏军为解放南斯拉夫而流血之时，南国现领袖的代理人洛姆巴等便已和美国谍报组织勾结，派遣佐恩尼到匈牙利去从事反对苏军的间谍行径了。
