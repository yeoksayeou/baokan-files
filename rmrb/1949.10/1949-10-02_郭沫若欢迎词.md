Thanks to the profound friendship of the Soviet people over the past thirty years, our Chinese People's Great Revolution has achieved a basic victory. The complete liberation of all of China is coming soon.

The obstacles hindering further close cooperation between our two great nations, China and the Soviet Union, have been removed.

Your presence gives us even greater encouragement.

We warmly welcome you, ready to accept your friendly guidance, and ready to accept all the valuable experiences of the Soviet people to engage in the construction of New China. Today, we have full confidence and strength to strengthen the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, to defend the lasting peace of the world.

Long live the close cooperation between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union!

Long live the victory of lasting world peace!

Long live the great revolutionary teacher Stalin!
