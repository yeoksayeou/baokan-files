　　Beijing Prepares to Welcome Delegates to the Asian-Australian Workers' and Asian Women's Conference
    Inspects Work in Various Factories
    Qinghe Woolen Mill Emphasizes Internationalist Education
    [Beijing News] The four inspection teams organized by the Beijing Preparatory Committee for Welcoming Delegates to the Asian-Australian Workers' and Asian Women's Conference, from the 24th to the 27th, went to eleven units, including the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant and the Tram Company, to inspect internationalist education, workers' clubs, labor protection and welfare facilities, and other conditions. According to the reports of each team, with the exception of two factories that have not yet established clubs, the clubs in other factories have been established or are being established, and this work is progressing well, but some are not substantial enough, and some are merely a formality. Regarding internationalist education, it has not been widely carried out in various factories. Some only explain it in study classes; some only distribute the teaching materials to workers' study groups without inspection and guidance, resulting in a laissez-faire approach. No attention has been paid to collecting workers' ideological reflections. This work urgently needs to be grasped and carried out by various factories. In the work of labor protection and welfare, there has been improvement in cleanliness and hygiene in various factories. However, some individual factories have not done enough, such as the Housheng Match Factory, where the factory building has only two windows and the air is not good; the toilets in the workers' dormitories of the People's Printing Factory have no doors and windows, and these should all be corrected. Based on the inspection results, the preparatory committee, after research, has put forward criticisms and suggestions to various factories, hoping that the party, government, and trade union leaders of the various factories will pay attention to these tasks and grasp them tightly. The inspection teams of the preparatory committee will also go to the factories at any time to inspect and help.

    Furthermore, in order to strengthen internationalist education, the Qinghe Woolen Mill trade union, in addition to giving workers large lectures, following the scrapbook exhibition of Chinese-Soviet friendship pictorials, has also held a Soviet painting exhibition since the 26th. Most of them introduce the life and production construction of Soviet workers, and the workers are full of admiration for the life of Soviet workers. They said, "We will be like this in five or ten years, right!" In order to answer this question, the trade union posted a large slogan: "Let us strive to learn from the Soviet Union!"

　　京欢迎亚澳职工亚洲妇女代表筹备会　
    检查各厂工作         
    清河制呢厂重视国际主义教育
    【北京讯】京市欢迎亚澳职工代表、亚洲妇代筹备会所组织的四个检查工作组，自二十四日起至二十七日止，分别至石景山钢铁厂、电车公司等十一单位检查国际主义教育、工人俱乐部、劳保福利设备等情况。据各组报告，除两个工厂尚未建立俱乐部外，其他工厂的俱乐部均已建立或正建立中，此项工作进行较好，但有的还不够充实，有的流于形式。关于国际主义教育，各工厂尚未普遍开展。有的仅在学习班中讲解；有的仅将教材发给工人学习小组，未检查指导，形成自流。对于工人思想反映，亦未注意收集。此项工作各工厂急需抓紧进行。劳保福利工作中，关于清洁卫生，各厂已有改进。但个别工厂做的还不够，如厚生火柴厂的厂房只有两个窗户，空气不好；人民印刷厂工人宿舍的厕所没有门窗，都应改正。该会根据检查结果，经研究后已对各厂提出批评及建议，希望各厂党、政、工负责人重视此数项工作，抓紧进行。该会之检查工作组并将随时下厂检查帮助。

    又讯：清河制呢厂工会为加强国际主义教育，除给工人上大课外，继中苏友好画刊剪报展览之后，自二十六日起，又举办苏联画片展览。大部为介绍苏联工人生活及生产建设，工人对苏联工人生活，赞羡不已。他们说：“我们搞五年十年，也成这样了吧！”工会为回答这个问题，贴出了大标语：“让我们努力向苏联看齐！”
