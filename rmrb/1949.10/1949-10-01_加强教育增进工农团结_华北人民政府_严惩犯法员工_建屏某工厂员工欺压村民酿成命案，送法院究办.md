　　Strengthen Education to Enhance Worker-Peasant Unity
　  North China People's Government
    Sternly Punishes Law-Breaking Employees
    A Factory in Jianping Caused a Death Due to Employees Bullying Villagers, Sent to Court for Investigation
    [Beijing News] A certain branch factory of a certain military industrial plant under the Enterprise Department stationed in a village in Jianping, Hebei, caused a death due to poor relations with the villagers. In late May, workers at the factory shielded the wife of worker Shi Dunrui from stealing, and quarreled with a small businessman. When village chief Yang Yue spoke improperly, Shi Dunrui, Li Junhao, and Ren Yubi instigated and organized workers to tie up and beat Yang Yue and farmers Li Yinhua and Zhang Li three times in a planned manner to force confessions. Shi even fabricated that he was beaten at night, and actually implemented security measures in the village, checking household registrations, which led to the death of Yang Yue's mother-in-law, Gu Linzi. In order to safeguard the people's laws and discipline and stabilize social order, the North China People's Government has strictly dealt with this matter. The main culprits in the case, Shi Dunrui, Li Junhao, and Ren Yubi, who bullied villagers, violated human rights, and disrupted social order, have been sent to the court for trial. Shi Xirong, the factory director of the branch factory, has consistently displayed bureaucratic work style and sectarian guild thinking. He failed to educate the workers adequately on weekdays. Not only did he fail to stop the dispute in time, but he also led guards to set up哨岗哨 (sentry posts), check household registrations, and bully villagers, causing a death. He should bear the main responsibility and be dismissed from his post and sent to the court for investigation. Accomplices in the same case, Liu Shuwan and 15 others, should conduct in-depth self-criticism, receive strict criticism and education, and be given appropriate punishment by the factory. Zhang Mingde, the factory director of the large factory, was given a major demerit for dereliction of duty and indulgence towards the serious illegal actions of the branch factory. Xu Zhiping, the chairman of the branch factory's trade union, and Zhou Dongjiu, a member of the trade union committee, failed to stop the workers' illegal actions and instead indulged them, and the General Military Industry Association was instructed to remove them from their posts. Village chief Yang Yue, who was detained, was immediately released and subjected to strict education and criticism by the county and district governments. As for Gu Linzi, who had died, the factory was ordered to provide generous compensation to comfort the bereaved family and quell public outrage among the villagers.
    The North China People's Government emphasized while handling this case that similar incidents have also occurred in other regions, mainly because sectarian guild thinking and remnants of warlordism still exist to a considerable extent among some workers and factory cadres. They do not value worker-peasant unity and do not abide by laws and discipline. Furthermore, some responsible cadres have an unclear understanding of worker-peasant unity and the people's democratic regime, and they do not provide sufficient education to employees, or even indulge them. In particular, some military industrial departments mistakenly emphasize their special status, often disrespect the opinions of local governments, and handle issues on their own, which is a state of anarchy and indiscipline. On the local cadre side, some have problems with their ideological work style, do not provide sufficient respect and care to factories, are narrow-minded, seek revenge, and do not provide sufficient education to farmers, which often leads to disputes. All factories in rural areas should earnestly examine their relationships with local governments and local farmers. If the problems are serious, the factory's superiors should send special personnel to cooperate with the responsible cadres of the local party and government to resolve the issues, in order to improve relations and eliminate antagonism. In the future, the Enterprise Department must effectively strengthen its leadership over all factories, strengthen the education of all employees, and thoroughly overcome the sectarian guild thinking and remnants of warlordism among workers and cadres. At the same time, local governments must also strengthen the education of cadres and farmers, consciously take care of workers, respect and assist state-owned enterprises, strengthen worker-peasant unity, and develop production.

　　加强教育增进工农团结
　  华北人民政府
    严惩犯法员工
    建屏某工厂员工欺压村民酿成命案，送法院究办
    【北京讯】驻河北建屏某村之企业部所属某兵工大厂某分厂因与村民关系不好，酿成人命。五月下旬，该厂工人袒护工人史敦瑞妻偷窃，与小商人争吵，村长杨月说话欠妥，史敦瑞、李俊豪、任玉璧即鼓动组织工人，有计划地三次将杨月及农民李银花、张里捆绑吊打逼供；史更伪造夜间被打，在村里居然实行警戒，清查户口，致逼死杨月之岳母谷林子。华北人民政府为维护人民法纪，安定社会秩序，顷对此事严格处理，该案主犯史敦瑞、李俊豪、任玉璧欺压村民，侵犯人权，扰乱社会秩序，送法院讯办。该分厂厂长施锡荣一贯的有官僚主义作风及宗派行会思想，平日对工人教育不紧，此次纠纷不但未及时制止，反带领警卫员布置岗哨，清查户口，欺压村民，酿成人命，应负主要责任，撤职送法院讯究。同案从犯刘树万等十六人应深刻检讨，严格批评教育，并由该厂酌情给予处分。该大厂厂长张明德，对分厂之严重非法行动，失职放纵，记大过一次。该分厂工会主任许志平，工会委员周东九，对工人非法行动未能制止，反而纵容，责成军工总会方面撤销其职务。被押村长杨月，立即释放，由县区政府严加教育批评。至已死之谷林子责成该厂重新从优抚恤，以慰死者家属，并平村民公愤。
    华北人民政府于处理此案同时着重指出，此类事件在其他地区亦有发生，主要是因为在某些工人及工厂工作干部中间，仍然存在着相当严重的宗派行会思想和某些干部的军阀主义残余思想，不重视工农团结，不守法纪；而若干负责干部对工农团结，对人民民主政权诸问题亦认识不清，对职工教育不够，甚至纵容放任；特别是有些军工部门，错误的强调特殊，常不尊重地方政府意见，擅自处理问题，这是一种无政府、无纪律状态。在地方干部方面，有些由于思想作风有毛病，对工厂尊重照顾不够，心地狭隘，寻隙报复，并对农民教育不够，致常生纠纷。在农村的各个工厂，应认真检查与地方政府及当地农民的关系。问题较严重者，该厂上级应派专人去协同当地党、政负责干部解决，以期改善关系，消除对立。今后企业部必须切实加强对各厂的领导，加强对全体职工的教育，彻底克服工人及干部中的宗派行会与军阀主义残余思想。同时各地政府亦必须加强对干部及农民的教育，自觉的照顾工人，尊重与协助国家企业，加强工农团结，发展生产。
