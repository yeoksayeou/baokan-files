　　Finance and Economics Committee Notifies All Agencies to Prepare Winter Coal Budget
　　[News from this newspaper] In order to allocate winter fuel in a planned way, the Beijing Municipal Finance and Economics Committee has notified all agencies, troops, organizations, schools, and enterprises in the city to submit their winter (October 15th to January 15th) coal usage budgets before October 20th (the budget should include: agency name, number of people, required amount of bituminous coal, anthracite coal, lump coal, and pulverized coal, as well as the time and location) to the committee at Fuyou Street, so that the Beijing Coal and Iron Company can be instructed to plan accordingly. Due to the flooding of the Mentougou coal mine this summer, production has sharply decreased. Now is the season for mass production of coal briquettes, and the committee is actively trying to restore the original production capacity of Mentougou coal. The source of bituminous coal is not lacking, but in order to conserve Kailuan bituminous coal for export and supply to Shanghai, it is planned to use bituminous coal from Kouquan and Xiahuayuan. To avoid temporary difficulties in supply, the committee has decided to adopt a planned distribution method.

　　财经委会通知各机关
    填造冬煤预算
    【本报讯】北京市财经委员会为有计划的分配冬季燃料，顷通知全市各机关、部队、团体、学校、企业，于十月二十日以前填造冬季（十月十五至一月十五日）用煤预算（预算内包括：机关名称，人数，须用烟煤、无烟煤、块煤、末煤数量及时间、地点），送交府右街该会，以便责成北京煤铁公司筹划。按今夏因门头沟煤矿被淹，产量锐减，现值大量制造煤球季节，该会正积极设法恢复门煤原有产量。烟煤来源不缺，但为节用开滦烟煤以便出口及供应上海，拟用口泉、下花园两地烟煤。为免供应上临时发生困难，该会决定采取有计划的配售办法。
