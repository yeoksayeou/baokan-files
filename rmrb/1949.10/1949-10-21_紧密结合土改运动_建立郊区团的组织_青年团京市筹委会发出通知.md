　　Closely Integrate with the Land Reform Movement
　　Establish Organizations for Suburban Leagues
　　Notice Issued by the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Municipal Youth League
[Beijing News] The notice issued by the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League of Beijing Municipality regarding several issues concerning the establishment of leagues in suburban areas is as follows:

　　(1) Half of the 600,000 population in the suburbs of Beijing are farmers, and the focus of youth work in the suburbs should be placed in rural areas. The majority of efforts must be directed towards doing a good job in the work of young farmers, but the work in factories (mainly small factories and handicrafts), schools, and towns should not be abandoned.
　　(2) League building work during land reform:
　　1. The current central task in the suburbs is land reform. This is a great revolutionary movement to completely eliminate feudal forces, as well as a great conscious mass movement for the liberation of the broad masses of farmers (including young farmers). It is necessary to mobilize the broad masses of young farmers to actively participate, and to educate and organize young people in this movement, and to absorb advanced elements to establish organizations of the Youth League with a focus and in a step-by-step manner. It is incorrect to conduct League work in isolation from the land reform movement, or not to do League building work during land reform.
　　2. In addition to actively participating in land reform work, youth work cadres should also study youth work issues, propose solutions, and raise them at working group meetings for discussion, so as to strive for everyone to participate in youth work, and not to regard youth work as just the responsibility of a few youth cadres.
　　3. During land reform, young farmers should not be grouped separately from middle-aged and elderly farmers. This can remedy the shortcomings of young people who, although enthusiastic and courageous, lack understanding of the situation and lack experience. Fathers and sons, mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law can be grouped separately to avoid hindering young people's发言 (fāyán; speaking/expressing opinions). If special issues related to young people need to be resolved, youth representative meetings or youth congresses can be convened, or temporary youth groups can be formed for activities.
　　4. The current youth propaganda and education work should focus on publicizing the liberation of farmers and the suburban land reform policy, and with the progress of the work and the improvement of the masses' awareness, coordinate with publicizing the nature and tasks of the Youth League, etc. The content of the publicity should be explained in response to the masses' questions, and specifically publicize the exemplary deeds of the Youth League in various places. In terms of methods, it can be combined with cultural learning and recreational activities according to the situation. League building during land reform should not be divided into stages, but it should not be too early (i.e., before the masses have been mobilized) or too late (i.e., after the land reform has basically ended); generally, it is appropriate to build the League when the movement starts and the masses are mobilized, their awareness is raised, and activists emerge. In the work of developing League members, outstanding members of farm laborers, poor peasants, and middle peasants should be recruited into the League, but it is necessary to ensure that the leadership component of the League is young people from poor peasant and farm laborer backgrounds. League building work must be carried out openly. The secretive and restrictive approach is wrong.
　　(3) League building work in suburban schools: There are nine middle schools and three hundred and ninety-one primary schools in the suburbs. Teachers play an important role in improving farmers' culture and the work of children and young people. Attention should be paid to the work of teachers, and the League's organization should be actively established. Whether or not to admit students from landlord and rich peasant families should be decided based on their performance in the land reform. Generally, they should not be developed before the land reform. Children and young people in schools should be organized by school rather than by street, in order to combine with learning.
　　(4) Development of League members and League life:
　　1. The criteria for joining the League should not be too high. Anyone who is ideologically progressive (supports the propositions of the Chinese Communist Party, is willing to actively struggle for the cause of the New Democratic Revolution, and is willing to serve the working people loyally) and actively participates in the land reform movement, works hard in production or studies hard, and does not have serious behavior that separates them from the masses, can be admitted to the League.
　　2. If there are five or more League members in an organization, a branch should be established, led by the youth committee member of the organization's Party branch. If there are fewer than five people, their regular organizational life can be spent within the Party branch, and it is generally not appropriate to combine League members from several organizations to form a large branch. The tasks of the organization's branch are mainly to ensure the completion of administrative work, conduct study, organize cultural entertainment, and carry out youth work.
　　3. In places where League members are relatively concentrated in organizations, factories, and schools, they can gather for activities once a month. The content can be a report from the district committee, or the transmission of a work report from the city. There can be cultural and entertainment programs in the meeting, paying attention to being lively.
　　(5) Organizational structure and system:
　　1. Establish a suburban working committee, with a secretary and deputy secretary, and an organization department and a propaganda department (other departments can be set up if necessary). Each suburban area establishes a district working committee of the Youth League, with a secretary and deputy secretary, and an organization department and a propaganda department (other departments can be set up if necessary).
　　2. A joint meeting of the secretaries and deputy secretaries of the district working committees should be held once a month, and a meeting of all suburban youth work cadres should be held when necessary.
　　3. Each district working committee should submit a written report to the suburban working committee once every half month.

### 紧密结合土改运动　建立郊区团的组织　青年团京市筹委会发出通知

　　紧密结合土改运动
  　建立郊区团的组织
  　青年团京市筹委会发出通知
  【北京讯】中国新民主主义青年团北京市筹委会关于郊区建团工作几个问题的通知，文如下：
  （一）北京市郊区六十万人口中半数是农民，郊区青年工作重心应放在农村。必须以大部力量作好青年农民工作，但不放弃工厂（主要是小型工厂及手工业等）、学校、市镇的工作。
  （二）土改中的建团工作：
  １、目前郊区中心工作是土地改革，这是彻底消灭封建势力的伟大革命运动，也是广大农民（包括青年农民）的伟大翻身自觉的群众运动，必须发动广大青年农民积极参加，并在这一运动中教育与组织青年，吸收先进分子有重点有步骤地建立青年团的组织。脱离了土改运动孤立地进行团的工作，或在土改中不做建团工作，都是不对的。
  ２、青年工作干部除积极参加土改工作外，同时要研究青年工作问题，提出办法，在工作组的会上提出讨论，以便争取大家动手都做青年工作，而不把青年工作看成只是几个青年干部的事情。
  ３、土改时青年农民不与中年、老年农民分开编组，这样可使青年虽有热情与勇气，但对情况不了解、经验不足的缺点得到补救。父子婆媳可以岔开编组，以免青年发言受到妨碍。若遇有关青年的特殊问题需要解决时，则可召开青年代表会或青年大会，或另组临时性青年小组，进行活动。
  ４、当前青年宣传教育工作，以宣传农民翻身和郊区土改政策为中心，并随着工作的进展、群众的觉悟程度的提高，配合宣传青年团的性质及任务工作等，宣传内容须针对群众的疑问予以解释，并具体宣传各地青年团的模范事迹。在方式上可根据情况结合文化学习及娱乐活动进行。在土改中建团不应划分阶段，但不宜过早（即群众尚未发动之前），也不宜过晚（即土改已基本结束）；一般地是运动开始及群众发动起来，觉悟提高了，积极分子涌现了的时候便可建团。在发展团员的工作上，应吸收雇农、贫农、中农中的优秀分子入团，但必须保障团的领导成份是贫农、雇农出身的青年。建团工作必须公开地进行。秘密的束手束脚的作法是错误的。
  （三）郊区学校中的建团工作：郊区有九个中学，三百九十一个小学。在提高农民文化及少年儿童工作中，教员有着重要的作用。应该注意教员工作，积极建立团的组织。对地主富农子弟的学生是否吸收，应视其在土改中表现来决定，一般土改前暂不发展。学校中少年儿童不应按街道而须按学校组织，以便与学习结合。
  （四）发展团员及团内生活问题：
  １、入团标准不应过高，凡思想进步（拥护中国共产党的主张，愿为新民主主义革命事业积极奋斗，愿为劳动人民忠诚服务）及积极参加土改运动，努力生产或努力学习而没有严重脱离群众行为者，即可吸收入团。
  ２、机关团员五人以上即设立支部，由机关党支部青年委员领导。不足五人者，其经常的组织生活可参加在党支部内过，一般不应联合几个机关的团员组成一个大支部。机关支部的任务主要为保证行政工作的完成，进行学习，组织文化娱乐，开展青年工作等。
  ３、在机关、工厂、学校团员比较集中的地方，每月可集中活动一次，内容为区委报告，或传达市内工作报告。会中可有文娱节目，注意生动活泼。
  （五）组织机构及制度：
  １、建立郊区工委会，设正副书记，及组织部、宣传部（必要时可设其他部门）。各郊区建立青年团区工作委员会，设正副书记及组织部、宣传部（必要时可设其他部门）。
  ２、各区工委正副书记联席会议每月召开一次，必要时召开全郊区青年工作干部会议。
  ３、各区工委会应每半月向郊区工委会作书面汇报一次。
  一九四九年十月十五日
