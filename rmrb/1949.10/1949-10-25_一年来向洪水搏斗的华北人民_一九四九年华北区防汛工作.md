The People of North China Fight Against Floods for a Year
  　Flood Control Work in North China in 1949
    Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, the people of North China have waged an unprecedentedly strong struggle against floods for more than ten years. This year, they have waged an organized and planned heroic struggle in the face of the largest floods in ten years, even a century.
    After the North China Flood Control Conference at the end of June, flood control headquarters were generally established in various regions based on river systems. The number of special, county, and district-level cadres involved in this work reached more than 2,170 in Hebei Central and Hebei Southern regions alone, and the total number in the region is estimated to be around 8,000. Many county heads and county party secretaries, etc., from the time the water rose to the time it receded, overcame various difficulties and always persisted in working on the dikes. In a very small number of counties, due to the failure to establish such organizations, or the failure to draw on the main responsible cadres to participate even if the organizations were established, the work performance was weak. This has generally aroused the vigilance and improvement of river defense cadres.
    Party Members and Cadres Bravely Fight Floods
    In order to deploy flood control work and implement instructions, various meetings were held in various places, such as: mobilization meetings for cadres of various levels of organs, joint meetings of local administrative cadres at various levels, joint meetings of departments related to flood control work, and cadre meetings of flood control headquarters at various levels. In many areas, the Party's deployment was conveyed from the prefectural committee to the village branch, mobilizing the broad masses of party members and cadres to actively participate in this flood control struggle. Therefore, many party members and cadres, regardless of hardships and sacrifices, took the lead in rescue and relief, setting off a flood of enthusiasm among the broad masses to "protect their homes and livelihoods." Many cadres persisted in working on the dikes while sick, demonstrating a high sense of responsibility to serve the people. A breach was discovered in the Dingxing section of the Juma River, which immediately widened to three feet. Lu Jin, the county head, immediately jumped into the water to rescue and protect it. The dike-guarding masses then went into the water one after another, even a farmer in his sixties jumped in. He said movedly, "The county head is working so hard, it's really rare!" The district party secretary and district head of the Seventh District of Wen'an risked their lives to plug the breach, squatting in the water until it was plugged before coming out, resulting in bleeding from their mouths and noses. Zhang Boliang, deputy director of the Flood Control Headquarters of the Thirteenth District of Wuqing, was guarding the Xuguantun section of the North Canal on August 4 when the opposite bank suddenly breached. In order to rush to the opposite bank to lead the masses to plug the breach, he immediately disregarded the danger and jumped into the river, unfortunately sacrificing himself in the flood. There are many examples of such leaders personally taking action and cadres taking the lead that deserve praise, and they will not be listed here one by one.
    Seize the Opportunity to Publicize and Mobilize
    Various opportunities were used and various methods were adopted to carry out publicity and mobilization work for the masses. At various mass meetings, in conjunction with various tasks, publicity was carried out for flood control work, and methods such as blackboards, radio stations, storytelling, street poems, and family visits were used to strive to make it known to every household. The Hebei Southern District also adopted the method of settling accounts with the masses, specifically explaining the disasters caused by floods every year, and inspiring the masses' enthusiasm for flood control. Therefore, tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of people went to the dikes when the river situation was critical and fought against the floods. Many people had difficult lives, eating chaff and vegetables, but they still actively participated in rescue and relief. This year, the Yellow River flood lasted for too long. In addition to the 25 days and nights of rescue and relief at Guantai during the flood season, the autumn flood followed, and the entire line was in danger. Five thousand cadres led 150,000 people to bravely rescue and protect it for more than ten days and nights, finally preventing the Yellow River from breaching at a single point, protecting the lives and property of the broad masses of people. When the Yongding River flooded on July 9, an overall mobilization order was issued, and 240,000 people went to the dikes together, turning dozens of dangerous works into safe ones. When the flood overflowed in the Eastern Hebei District, the masses sat in rows at the breach, using their bodies to block the water and buy time for repairing and plugging. There are also countless examples of the broad masses of people risking their lives to rescue and relieve the disaster. From young people to the elderly, from women to children, they were all involved in flood control work. Many active women led the broad masses of women to rescue and protect together with the men. A child in a village discovered a leak on the dike, immediately took off his own jacket, plugged the leak, and ran back to the village to summon people to repair and plug it, finally avoiding a breach. Various facts show that the process of successfully completing flood control work is precisely the process of deeply mobilizing the masses, organizing the masses, and relying on the masses to fight against water. Attempts to solve problems with simple orders will inevitably fail. An armed cadre in the Sixth District of Qingxian ordered the masses in a rude manner, resulting in the laborers being active in front of him but slacking off behind his back, forming an antagonistic relationship with the cadre.
    Implement the Overall View of Local Subordination to the Whole
    Implementing the overall view of small interests subordinating to large interests and local subordination to the whole is also one of the important factors for successfully completing river management work. Because this principle was better implemented this year, there are many examples of cadres and the masses in various places supporting each other when the flood was critical. When the Zhukou dangerous work on the Yellow River was in danger, engineering teams from Kaifeng, Huayuankou, Guantai, and Linpu rushed to reinforce it. The Liangshan section took the initiative to help the Yunbei section rescue and protect the dam. When the masses of Laosongzhuang in the Fourth District of Jixian were driving piles and hanging willows at the West Street entrance of the village, they suddenly heard that the Niangniang Temple, three miles away, was in danger, and immediately dispatched a group to run to assist in the rescue. Many dangerous works have thus avoided breaching.
    Strengthen Pre-Flood Inspection Work
    The preparatory work and the inspection of dikes and defenses before and during the flood season have also been strengthened compared to the past. The entire North China region inspected and plugged a total of 17,747 rat holes and badger burrows, repaired 35,677 wave nests, water eyes, works, road crossings, and cracks, and filled 3,678.7 meters of trenches. Together with the flood season rescue, a total of 1,995,000 man-days (Yellow River figures excluded) were used, and 2,910,000 cubic meters of earthwork were completed (Yellow River figures excluded). In order to facilitate the flood workers to persist in working on the dikes, flood shelters and flood shops were generally set up on the rivers throughout the region, with more than 7,400 set up in the former Hebei Central and Hebei Southern regions alone.
    In order to scientifically grasp the water situation, hydrological stations, water level stations, and rainfall stations have generally been established in the upper and middle reaches of the rivers. From the North China Water Conservancy Commission to the rivers, sections, and stations, a flood reporting network was established using radios, telegrams, and telephones, which not only made water information in this region readily available, but also directly connected to neighboring regions (such as the connection between the Yellow River and the Bohai Sea region). Facts have proved that timely grasp of the water situation not only facilitates protection, but also greatly saves manpower.
    Although the dikes and defenses of the rivers in the North China region have been repaired over the years, many dikes and defenses are quite difficult to defend due to the damage caused by wars and enemies in the past, the lack of repair for many years, and the limitations of manpower and material resources. Although a large amount of force was paid for the spring repair this year, it was only a selective repair of dangerous areas, and the general dikes and defenses were not further strengthened. On such a river defense foundation, there are many difficulties. Moreover, the rainfall in the northern and eastern parts of Hebei Province was particularly concentrated this year. The rainfall in July exceeded the average rainfall in the same month in previous years since the hydrological records in North China by nearly one time. The water levels of each river, except for the rivers in the Hebei Southern District, generally exceeded the highest flood level in 1939 by 20 centimeters to 1 meter. Among them, the Luan River and the Ji Canal were also hit by typhoons, and the flood flow exceeded the highest flood flow in previous years by about one time. The highest flood flow of the Luan River once reached 24,000 cubic meters per second, which was a major flood unseen in a century. Except for the Ji Canal and Luan River, which had unprecedented floods and could not be resisted, the main dikes of other rivers did not breach under the heroic rescue of the broad masses of people even when they exceeded the flood level of 1939 and even overflowed. In particular, the main dikes of the Yellow River did not experience a single breach even with a flow exceeding the planned flow (16,500 cubic meters per second) by 500 cubic meters per second, and the flood lasted for an unprecedentedly long time. The Guantai dangerous work alone was continuously rescued and protected for 25 days and nights, using more than 3 million catties of straw and willow, and finally turned the danger into safety.
    In general, this year's flood control work has generally achieved many results. Individual areas have shortcomings such as insufficient preparation, complacency and negligence, poor sense of responsibility, unsound organization, and inflexible command. The main experiences and lessons are:
    Three Lessons Learned
    1. Experience has proved that the command headquarters at all levels composed of water conservancy work organs and the main cadres of the Party, government, and army is the most powerful organizational form for successfully leading and completing flood control work. In areas where such organizational structures have been established, and the leaders can personally take the lead, supervise and inspect, the work is well completed. If its command structure is unsound or has a position but no power, and various instructions cannot be implemented, then the work will inevitably be stalled.
    2. We must overcome commandism, patiently and deeply publicize and mobilize, mobilize and rely on the masses; leaders personally take action, overcome bureaucracy, strengthen inspections; overcome the mentality of luck, strengthen preparations; overcome departmentalism, implement the overall thinking of small interests subordinating to large interests; overcome empiricism, scientifically grasp the water situation, and establish a smooth flood reporting network; and strictly divide responsibilities section by section, strictly enforce rewards and punishments, etc., in order to guarantee the successful completion of flood control work.
    3. A large number of manpower was mobilized during the flood season, and many projects were rushed to repair, but working in the rainy season not only affects the production of the masses, but also the waste of materials is alarming. The same project requires one man-day in the spring, but several times more in the flood season, so the lack of spring work is the basic reason for the waste. For example, because the Yongding River dike was not restored in the spring, it had to be rushed to repair the sub-dike when the flood water overflowed the dike, but the nearby dikes were all water, so it had to go to a place four miles away to get soil, which led to serious time and effort consumption. Therefore, the masses have requested to strengthen annual repairs. In order to avoid too much spring work that cannot be completed on time, a part of the project should be completed in a planned way during the autumn slack season to reduce the amount of spring work. This year, the postponement of spring work completed one step, which affected the preparation of flood control work and the timely establishment of flood control organizations, making the work passive in the early stage.
    Although the flood season has passed, the severe floods have caused heavy post-disaster reconstruction work. Therefore, the people of North China are still continuing their heroic struggle against the flood disaster.

　　一年来向洪水搏斗的华北人民
  　一九四九年华北区防汛工作
    十几年来华北人民在中国共产党和人民政府的领导之下，与洪水作了空前坚强的斗争，今年，更在十年以来甚至百年以来的巨大洪水面前，作了有组织有计划的英勇斗争。
    六月底华北防汛会议结束后，各地区普遍建立了以河系为单位的防汛指挥部，投入这一工作的专、县、区级干部，仅冀中、冀南两区的统计即达二千一百七十余人，全区估计当在八千人左右。许多县的县长和县委书记等自涨水到落水，克服种种困难，始终在堤上坚持工作。极少数的县份，由于没有建立这样的组织，或虽建立了组织而没有抽调主要负责干部参加，工作成绩显得薄弱。现已普遍引起河防干部的警惕与改进。
    党员干部奋勇防汛
    为了布置防汛工作、贯彻指示，各地分别召开了各种会议，如：各级机关干部动员会，各级地方行政干部联席会，与防汛工作有关的部门联席会，以及各级防汛指挥部干部大会等。许多地区党的布置，由地委一直贯彻到村支部，发动了广大的党员、干部积极地参加了这一防汛斗争。因此，许多党员、干部不避艰苦，不畏牺牲，在抢险当中积极带头，掀起了广大群众的“保家保饭碗”的防洪热潮。许多干部带病在堤上坚持工作，表现出为人民服务的高度责任心。拒马河定兴段曾发现一个漏洞，当时即冲宽到三丈，该县县长陆锦立即跳进水中抢护，守堤群众随即纷纷下水，连一个六十多岁的老农民也跳下去了，他感动地说，县长还这样拼命，真是难得！文安七区区委书记及区长，舍身堵漏洞，蹲在水中，直到堵好后方才出来，结果口鼻流血。武清十三区防汛指挥部副主任张伯良，在八月四日防守北运河徐官屯段时，突然对岸决口，为急于到对岸领导群众抢堵，当即不顾危险，奋身渡河，不幸牺牲在洪水中。这种领导人亲自下手，干部带头值得表扬的范例是很多的，这里不一一列举了。
    利用时机宣传动员
    利用各种时机，采取多种方式进行对群众的宣传与动员工作。在各种群众会议上，结合着各种工作，进行了防汛工作的宣传，并利用了黑板报，广播台，说书，街头诗，家庭访问等方式以争取作到家喻户晓。冀南区更采取了和群众算帐的方式，具体说明洪水每年造成的灾害，启发群众防汛的积极性。因此，数万以至十数万的群众，在河势告急时上堤与洪水展开了搏斗。很多群众生活困难，吃糠咽菜，仍然积极抢险。今年黄河洪水持续过久，除伏汛期贯台抢险二十五昼夜外，接着秋汛又至，全线危急，五千干部率领十五万群众，奋勇抢护十余昼夜，终于使黄河未决一口，保卫了广大人民的生命财产。永定河七月九日洪水涨发时，总动员令下，二十四万群众一齐上堤，使数十处险工化险为夷。冀东区群众在洪水漫决时，排坐在决口处，以身体阻水争取时间进行修堵。广大群众中不避生命危险，舍身抢险的例子，也是举不尽的。由青年到老年，由妇女到儿童，一齐卷入了防汛工作，许多妇女中的积极分子率领广大妇女，和男人们一同抢护。某村一个儿童发现堤上漏水，立即脱下自己的小褂，堵住漏洞，并跑回村里召人修堵，终于避免了决口。种种事实说明了胜利完成防汛工作的过程，正是深入地发动群众组织群众并依靠群众与水作斗争的过程。企图用简单的命令来解决问题，是没有不遭到失败的。青县六区一个武装干部，用打骂方式命令群众，结果民工当面积极，背后怠工，与干部形成了对立状态。
    贯彻局部服从整体
    贯彻小利服从大利，局部服从全体的整体观点，也是胜利完成治河工作的重要因素之一。由于今年这一原则贯彻较好，因而各地干部群众在洪水危急时互相支援的范例也很多。黄河朱口险工告急时，开封、花园口、贯台、临濮等地工程队，曾驰往增援。梁山段曾主动帮助郓北段抢护大堤。蓟县四区老宋庄群众正在该村西街口打桩挂柳时，突闻相距三里之娘娘庙出险，马上即分出一部跑步前往协助抢救。多处险工，均因此避免了决口。
    加强汛前检查工作
    在准备工作以及汛前、汛期的堤防检查工作，也较以往加强了。全华北区共检查、修堵了鼠穴、獾洞一七、七四七处、修补浪窝、水眼、工事、道口、裂缝等三五、六七七处、填平壕沟三、六七八·七公尺，加上汛期抢险，共用人工一百九十九万五千余个（黄河数字在外），做土方二百九十一万余公方（黄河数字在外）。为便于汛工能在堤上坚持工作，全区各河普遍搭设汛房、汛铺，仅原冀中冀南两区即搭设七千四百余处。
    为了科学的掌握水情，各河中上游一般都建立了水文站、水位站、雨量站。由华北水利委员会直到各河、各段、各站，利用电台、电报、电话，建立了报汛连络网，不但本区水讯灵通，且直接联系到友邻地区（如黄河与渤海区连系）。事实证明，及时掌握水情，不但便利了防护，而且大大节约了人力。
    华北区各河堤防，虽经历年修整，但不少堤防因过去遭受战争、敌人破坏、年久失修等原因，与受人力、物力条件之限制，防汛任务是相当艰巨的。今年春修虽支付了较大的力量，但仅系择险修整，一般堤防并未能进一步加强。在这样的河防基础上，困难是不少的。而今年河北省北部及东部雨量又特别集中，七月份降雨量超过华北有水文记载以来历年同月平均降雨量将近一倍。各河水位除冀南区各河外，一般都超过了一九三九年最高洪水位二公寸到一公尺。其中滦河、蓟运二河并受台风侵袭，洪水流量超过历年最高洪水流量一倍左右，滦河洪水流量最高曾达两万四千秒立方公尺，为百年来未遇的大水。除蓟、滦二河以洪水空前，无法拒抗外，其他各河在超过一九三九年洪水位甚至漫顶的情况下，经广大群众英勇抢护，主要堤防均未决口。尤其是黄河在超过计划流量（一六五○○秒立方公尺）五○○秒立方公尺的流量，且洪水持续时间空前长的情况下，主要堤防未发生一个决口。仅贯台一处险工即连续抢护了二十五昼夜，用秸柳达三百余万斤，终于化险为夷。
    总起来说，今年防汛工作一般是有不少成绩的。个别地区存在着准备不够，麻痹疏忽，责任心差，组织不健全，指挥不灵活等缺点。主要经验教训是：
    获得三点经验教训
    一、经验证明，由水利工作机关配合党、政、军主要干部组成的各级指挥部，是顺利的领导完成防汛工作的最有力的组织形式。凡是建立了这种组织机构的地区，而首长又能亲自带头、督促与检查，则工作完成的好。其指挥机构不健全或形成有职无权，各种指示贯彻不下去，则工作必致推不动。
    二、必须克服命令主义，耐心地深入地宣传动员，发动并依靠群众；首长亲自下手，克服官僚主义，加强检查；克服侥幸思想，加强准备；克服本位主义，贯彻小利服从大利的整体思想；克服经验主义，科学地掌握水情，并建立灵通的报汛连络网；并严格地分段负责，严明赏罚等等，才能保证胜利完成防汛工作。
    三、汛期动员了大批人力，抢修了许多工程，但雨季作工，既影响群众生产，工料浪费数字也惊人，同样工程春工用一工，汛期就要加数倍，所以春工不足，乃是造成浪费的基本原因。如永定河堤因春工未复，汛水漫堤时不得不抢修子埝，但近堤皆水，不得不到四里地以外去取土，遂致严重地耗时费力。因此群众曾提出要求加强岁修。为避免春工过多，不能按期完成，应有计划地利用秋天农闲时期完成一部工程，减少春工数量。今年即因春工推迟完成了一步，影响了防汛工作的准备及防汛组织的及时建立，使工作在初期陷于被动。
    目前汛期虽过，但因水灾严重，造成繁重的善后工程，因此，华北人民仍在与汛灾继续进行着英勇的斗争。
