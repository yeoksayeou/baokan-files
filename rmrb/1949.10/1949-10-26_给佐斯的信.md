　　Letter to Zoss
　　Gil Green
　　(Gil Green is one of the eleven American Communist leaders on trial. He is a member of the National Committee of the American Communist Party and chairman of the Illinois State Committee. Here is a short letter from his son to him, and his reply.)
　　"Dear Daddy: We are fine. The fire snake's tail fell off, but it's still alive. When Danny was playing with it, its tail fell off. How are you? Greetings to you. Zoss."
　　Dear Zoss: I know how you and Danny were playing with that poor fire snake. I am not surprised its tail fell off, but I am surprised you haven't knocked its head off yet!
　　You ask me how I am, well, Zoss, it's a long story.
　　You know I am on trial in New York, and I spend most of my time in court. You don't know what a court is, it's where people go to get justice, just like Mom goes to the butcher for meat.
　　Of course, the court and the butcher are not exactly the same. For example, meat has a price and can be bought, but justice, because it is priceless, is considered free. But here is another difference, you can see meat with your eyes, touch it with your fingers, and taste it with your mouth. Everyone knows meat, whether they have money to buy it or not, whether they are rich or poor.
　　But justice is not like this. Two people can look at it at the same time, and one says it is justice while the other firmly disagrees and says it is injustice. This seems inexplicable at first glance, but you will understand it very well if you think about it a little more. Many years ago, when neither you nor I were born, a great American from our state of Illinois knew this truth and stated it in a very obvious way. This person, Abraham Lincoln, said: "To some, the word freedom means that each man can do as he pleases with himself, and the product of his labor; while to others, the same word may mean that some men can do as they please with other men, and the product of other men’s labor. Here are two, not only different, but incompatible things, called by the same name—freedom."
　　So old Lincoln used such a story to explain: "The shepherd drives the wolf from the sheep's throat, for which the sheep thanks the shepherd as a liberator, while the wolf denounces him for the same act… Plainly, the sheep and the wolf are not agreed upon a definition of the word liberty." The same is true for justice.
　　Lincoln was talking about such an era in American history: at that time, a small number of hundreds of thousands of white farmers owned millions of black men, women, and children, using them at will as slaves. In order to maintain their brutal system, the southern white slave-owning class plunged the country into a four-year civil war, and they also waged war in the name of maintaining "freedom" and "justice." Because justice, in their view, meant keeping slaves. But, for the slaves, justice meant ending slavery and obtaining the right to freedom.
　　But, don't get one thing wrong in Lincoln's story. The oppressed people never wait like sheep for a shepherd to save them, they fight for their own liberation; black people have fought heroically to break free from the cruel chains of slavery. Today, in different circumstances, they continue to fight for freedom.
　　Yes, Zoss, sheep and wolves will not define freedom and justice in the same way. You can know from your own experience. You remember last spring, Dickey's father's union went on a long and difficult strike to increase wages. You remember how the canning company managers used newspapers and radio to attack the workers, saying they had no right to strike, and called the police to protect those who sabotaged the strike, and then had the court issue orders to ban demonstrations. Finally, they used hunger to force the workers to return to work. They refused to give the workers wages sufficient to maintain their lives, and shamelessly raised the price of meat, blaming it on the workers' demand for "high wages."
　　All of this was done in the name of justice, because for the owners of the canning company, justice means the right to plunder the sweat and labor of the workers; and the right to live in magnificent mansions in laziness and luxury while the workers live in crowded slums in poverty.
　　Now let me tell you again why I am in court, but I am not alone! There are ten other people on trial with me, most of whom you are familiar with. You know Johnny Dennis, you have heard his speeches and remember when you were very, very young, he was a guy who often gave you piggyback rides. You also know Johnny Williamson and Johnny Gates, you have seen them many times in our home. There is also Henry Winston, who lived in our house when he came to Chicago, and Danny regarded him as a hero in those years! In addition, you will never forget big Ben Davis, when we lived in New York, we spent many happy times with him, and he even coaxed you into saying that Central Park was all his! But perhaps you have forgotten Jack Stacher, but his son took you and Danny to see the planetarium last summer when he came to Chicago.
　　Well, all these friends of yours, and a few others you don't know, are with me in court as defendants, they are my comrades and friends.
　　So, why are we here? Because we and the party we represent—the Communist Party—believe in freedom and justice and fight for them, for the people, for the vast majority of Americans who live by labor, for the men and women who make this country great with their labor. But those wolves in human clothing that Lincoln spoke of do not like this. Through the government and courts they control, they have brought us to trial. They want to imprison us and make our party illegal.
　　They are trying to do this now because the wolf's system—the capitalist system—is at the end of its rope all over the world. People everywhere are waking up and fighting for their rights and freedom. So the wolves are becoming more and more crazy and more ferocious out of desperation. This is why they want to destroy all the freedoms and rights that the people in this country have won through long struggles. At the same time, they vainly hope that they can eliminate the great movement of the world's working people through massacres and another world war.
　　The last time I was home, your mother told me something you said that made us laugh for a long time. You remember your teacher asked you and your classmates to write an article describing an unusual event you had experienced in your life. That day you came home with a bitter face and complained: "Nothing ever happens in our family." But now you know that some things have happened. In America, there are too many people who have no idea what is happening among them, they believe that disaster will befall other countries, but nothing will ever happen here.
　　The Germans thought the same way, where it started with imprisoning communists and declaring the Communist Party illegal. But it didn't end there, and immediately, all freedoms were destroyed, that was fascism. Then came the war, not only the German people were affected, but the whole world suffered disaster. Millions of young people lost their lives; tens of millions of children became homeless orphans; six million Jews were brutally murdered; just because they were Jewish. And if your grandfather had not immigrated to this country at the beginning of this century, then our family would probably also be among the victims.
　　You were born in the war, you were born at a time when the whole world was shrouded in sorrow and darkness. On November 1, 1941, the very day you opened your eyes, Hitler's army was boasting of reaching the outskirts of Moscow. Many, many people thought: This is the end—the fascist beast will rule the earth, but it didn't happen. The people of the Soviet Union (who thirty-one years ago replaced the wolf's system with a system of laboring people, that is, socialism) broke the spine of the fascist beast and won the war together with the people of the world.
　　From this, you can know that if something happens in one family or party, it means that it will also happen in other families or parties. Now what your father and his friends are experiencing in the trial is also what the entire American people are experiencing. When people can be sent to court for their beliefs, then all the rights of the American people are in danger—their right to think, the right to speak, the right to write, the right to teach, and the right to assemble and associate. That's why America itself is on trial with us.

### 给佐斯的信

　　给佐斯的信
    吉尔柏·格林
    （吉尔柏·格林是十一位受审的美共领袖之一。他是美共全国委员会委员兼伊利诺斯州州委会主席，这里是他儿子写给他的一封短信，和他的复信。
    “亲爱的爸爸：我们很好。那条火蛇的尾巴掉下来了，但它还活着呢。当丹尼和它玩着的时候，它的尾巴就掉了下来。你怎样？问候你。佐斯。”
    亲爱的佐斯：我知道了你和丹尼是怎样玩弄那条可怜的火蛇，我一点也不诧异它的尾巴掉了下来，却是奇怪它的头还没有被你们弄掉呢！
    你问我怎样，好吧，佐斯，说起来话很长哩。
    你知道我是在纽约受审判，我大部时间都消费在法庭中。你不知道法庭吧，那是人民去取得正义的地方，就象妈妈去屠户取肉一样。
    当然罗，法庭和屠户是不全一样的。就譬如：肉是有价钱可以买的，但正义呢，因为它是无价的，所以又被当作是免费的。但这儿又有另外的一方面不相同，肉你可以用你的眼睛看见，用你的手指摸到和用你的嘴巴尝到，谁都认识肉，不论他有没有钱买它，也不管他是富有或是贫穷。
    但正义就不象这样了，两个人可以同时看着它，结果一个说它是正义而另一个却坚决不同意地说它是非正义。这骤看起来好象无从解释，但你只要稍为多想一想就会很明白了。许多年以前，当我和你都未曾出世的时候，有一位出自我们伊利诺斯州的伟大的美国人就知道了这个真理，又用很明显的方法述说了出来。这个人，阿伯拉罕·林肯说：“在一些人看来，自由这名词意指每个人都可以随自己的意志支配他的自身和他劳动的产品；但对另外一些人，这同一个名词却意指有些人可以随意支配别人和别人劳动的产品了。这儿不止是两个不同的东西，而是两个对立的东西，却被唤作同一个名称：自由。”
    于是老林肯用这样一个故事来解释说：“牧羊人把狼从羊的咽喉上赶跑，羊因此感谢牧羊人的解救，但同时狼却因此而非难他了……很明显的，羊和狼是不会对自由下同样的定义的。”对正义也一样。
    林肯是说及美国史上这样一个时代：那时少数的几十万白人农场主拥有好几百万的黑人男女和小孩子，随意驱使他们，把他们作为奴隶，又为了维护他们这一凶残的制度，南方的白人奴隶主阶级把国家抛进了持续四年之久的内战中，并且他们也用了维护“自由”和“正义”的名字来进行战争的。因为正义在他们看来就是保有奴隶。但，对于奴隶们，正义却意指终止奴役和获得自由的权利。
    但在林肯这故事中，有一件事你不要弄错了。被压迫的人民永不象羊儿那样只等待着牧人来解救，他们会为自己底解放而斗争；黑人们就曾经英勇地为解脱那残酷的奴隶之锁链而战斗。在今天，于不同的环境下，他们又继续在为争取自由而斗争。
    是的，佐斯，羊和狼是不会对自由和正义下同一定义的。你可以从你自己的经验中知道，你记得去年春天，迪奇他父亲的工会曾经为了增加工资而进行过长久而艰苦的罢工。你记得那些罐头公司的经理曾怎样利用报纸和广播攻击工人，说他们没有罢工的权利，又召了警察去保护那些破坏罢工的人，又使法院发布命令去取缔示威运动。最后，又利用饥饿逼使工人复工。他们拒绝给工人以足以维持生活的工资，同时无耻地把肉类的价钱提高，却又把这归咎于工人的“高工资”的要求。
    如此等等，无不假正义之名以行，因为对于罐头公司的主人，正义是指掠夺工人底汗汁和劳力底权利；和当工人们居住在拥挤的贫民窟中过着贫困生活时，他们却可以居住在华丽的大厦里过着懒惰而奢侈的生活底权利。
    现在我再说为什么我会在法庭中吧，但不止我一个人哩！和我在一起受审判的另外还有十个人，大多数你都和他们熟悉的。你知道占尼·但尼斯，你曾听过他的演讲和记得当你还很小很小的时候，他是一个常常把你骑在他背上玩儿的家伙。你也认识庄尼·威廉姆逊和庄尼·盖兹，在我们家中你曾见过他们许多次。还有亨利·温斯顿，当他来芝加哥时他住在我们家里，在那些年月中，丹尼老把他当作一个英雄人物哩！此外你也永不会忘记大个子班·戴维斯，当居住纽约的时候，我们曾和他度过许多快乐的时光，他还哄过你说中央公园是他所有的呢！但是或者你已经忘记了杰克·史塔彻了，但是他的儿子在去年夏天来芝加哥时，也曾带了你和丹尼去看过行星仪。
    好吧，所有这些你的朋友，和另外几个你不认识的，都和我在一起在法庭中同为被告，他们都是我的同志和朋友。
    那么，为什么我们会在这里呢？因为我们和我们所代表的党——共产党——信仰自由和正义而且为它们斗争，为了人民，为了那些以劳动为生的占最大多数的美国人，为了那些以他们底劳动来使这个国家伟大起来的男男女女。但林肯所说的那些穿着人衣的群狼不喜欢这些，通过他们所控制的政府和法院，他们把我们拿来审判。他们要把我们囚禁而且把我们的党变为非法。
    他们现在尝试这样做，那是因为在全世界，那狼的制度——资本主义的制度已经日暮途穷。一切地方的人民都已觉醒，为着他们底权利和自由而战斗。于是群狼便日益疯狂，日益因绝望而更凶悍了。这便是为什么他们要整个地摧毁在这国度中人民用长期的斗争所争取得来的一切的自由和权利。同时他们又妄想他们能够用屠杀和另一次世界大战来消灭世界劳动人民底伟大的运动。
    当最后一次我在家时，你妈妈告诉我一些你所说的话，使我们笑了好一大阵。你记得你的老师曾叫你和你的同学作一篇文章，记述你一生中所曾经历的不平常的事件。那天你回家便苦着脸抱怨说：“我们家从来就不曾发生过什么事。”但是现在你知道是有些事发生了。在美国，就有太多人丝毫不知道在他们之间发生了些什么事，他们相信大祸会降临在别的国度，却永不会有什么会在这里发生。
    德国人也曾这样想过，在那里也是由监禁共产党人和把共产党宣布为非法开头的。但并不就这样算了，立即，一切自由都被摧毁了，那便是法西斯。随着来了战争，不止是德国人民受影响，而且全世界的遭到了灾祸。几百万青年失掉了他们的生命；千千万万小孩子变成无家的孤儿；六百万犹太人残酷地被屠杀了；只因为他们是犹太人。而如果你的祖父不在这世纪的初年迁徙了来这个国家，那么我们一家恐怕也在牺牲者之中了。
    你生在战争中，你生在全世界都被悲苦和黑暗所笼罩的时候。一九四一年十一月一日，正在你张开了眼睛的那天，希特勒的军队正因为攻抵莫斯科底外围而自吹自擂。许许多多人都想：这算完了——法西斯野兽将要继而统治地球了，但结果没有。苏维埃联邦的人民（他们在三十一年前用劳动人民的制度，即社会主义，代替了狼的制度），砍断了法西斯野兽底脊梁，与全世界的人民一起赢了战争。
    由此，你可以知道，假若有什么事在一个家庭或政党中发生，便表示也会在其他家庭或政党中发生。现在你爸爸和他的朋友在审判中的遭遇，也就是全美人民的遭遇。当人们可以因其信仰而被送到法院时，那么全美国人民的各种权利也便都在危殆中——他们底思想的权利，言论的权利，著作的权利，教授的权利和集会结社的权利。这就是为什么美国本身是和我们一道在受审判。
