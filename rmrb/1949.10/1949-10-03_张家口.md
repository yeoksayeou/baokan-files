　　[Our reporter, Zhangjiakou, 1st dispatch] When the news of Chairman Mao's election as Chairman of the Central People's Government reached Zhangjiakou, people from all walks of life in the city were immediately stirred. The Chahar Provincial Trade Company dispatched propaganda floats that evening. The Zhangjiakou Normal School, the Provincial Party Committee's Cultural Troupe, and other units performed victory skits, clapper talk shows, and costumed Yangko dances. Workers in various factories were also busy pasting flags and making lanterns. Male and female workers from the Zhangyuan Machine Factory and the Cigarette Factory held a discussion that evening, and the workers of the Telecommunications Bureau held a celebration party that evening.

    【本报记者张家口一日专电】当毛主席当选中央人民政府主席的消息传来张市后，全市各界立刻轰动起来。察省贸易公司当晚出动宣传彩车，张家口师范、省委文工团等单位，演出胜利活报、打板说唱化装秧歌。各厂工人也多忙于糊旗扎灯。张垣机器厂、纸烟厂的男女工人，当晚举行座谈，电讯局工人当晚便举行庆祝晚会。（吕光明）
