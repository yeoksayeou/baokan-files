Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 16th—Some state-owned enterprises in Tianjin have been improving work efficiency and reducing raw material consumption in the course of carrying out the production and economy campaign, thus gradually reducing production costs. After the second firing of the open-hearth furnace at the Tianjin Steel Plant on August 29, steel was continuously smelted for sixteen days. The average output per furnace was two and a half tons more than the first firing, and the raw material loss was also reduced by 6% compared with the previous time, approaching the standard loss. The average coal consumption per ton of steel was 0.437 tons, a decrease of 43% compared with the previous firing, and the electricity consumption was also reduced by 2.5 kilowatt-hours. The rolling mill of the plant saved 230 kilograms of steel material per ton of wire rod produced compared to the past. The gasoline used in the machinery workshop has been greatly reduced, while the machines are still well protected. The gasoline used in September was only equal to the consumption of the previous two or three days. After the Tianjin Railway Bureau's Tianjin Machinery Plant established a responsibility system for machines from repair and inspection to use, and a car repair report system, the workers did not increase in July, August, and September, but the production increased from an average of 20 vehicles of various types repaired per month to more than 90 vehicles, thus reducing production costs. Due to the strengthening of water meter inspection and replacement work, the water loss of the Tianjin Waterworks in September was reduced to 21.3%, gradually approaching the normal loss of 18%. In addition to paying attention to the maintenance of vehicles and reducing the rate of vehicle failures and accidents, the employees of the Tram Company are also planning to build a half-ton electric steelmaking furnace, which is now mostly completed. If the test results are good, all kinds of working tools and various parts needed by the trams can be manufactured by the factory itself in the future. Since Wang Jiude, a foreman in the box-making department of the general factory of the Zhonghua Match Factory, transformed the large strip machine for cutting thin wood veneer, the production efficiency has been greatly increased, and more than half of the box-making cost can also be saved.

　　天津部分国营企业生产节约
  　逐渐降低生产成本
    【新华社天津十六日电】天津市部分国营企业，在开展生产节约运动中，提高工作效能，减少原料消耗，使生产成本逐渐降低。天津制钢厂马丁炉八月二十九日第二次开炉后，连续炼钢十六天，平均每炉比第一次多出两吨半，原料损耗量也较上次减少百分之六，已接近标准损耗量。每吨钢平均用煤○·四三七吨，较上次减少百分之四十三，用电量也减少了两度半。该厂轧钢厂制造盘条，每吨产品比过去节省钢料二百三十公斤。机械场所用的汽油大大减少了，而机器照样保护得很好。九月份一个月所用的汽油，仅等于以前两三天的耗费量。天津铁路局天津机厂建立了从修理、检查到使用的机器负责制和修车表报制度后，七、八、九三个月中工人并未增加，生产由每月平均修理各种车辆二十辆增至九十余辆，生产成本因之降低。天津市自来水厂由于加强了水表的检查与换装工作，九月份产水损耗量减至百分之二一·三，逐渐接近百分之十八的正常损耗量。电车公司职工除注意爱护车辆、减少坏车率与意外事故外，并筹建半吨电力炼钢炉一座，现已大部竣工。如试验结果良好，今后全厂各种工作工具及电车所需各种零件，即可自行制造。中华火柴厂总厂制盒部自经领工王久德改造了切薄木皮的大条机以后，生产效率大为增加，亦可节省一半以上的制盒成本。
