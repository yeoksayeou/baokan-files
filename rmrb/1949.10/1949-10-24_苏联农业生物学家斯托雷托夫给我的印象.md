　　My Impression of Soviet Agricultural Biologist Stoletev
    Cai Banghua
    The Soviet delegation of cultural, artistic, and scientific workers' visit to Beijing not only allowed them to participate in our nation's founding ceremony but also to engage in friendly visits and speeches in various directions. Among them, Mr. Stoletev, a renowned Doctor of Plant Biology and President of the Timiryazev Agricultural Academy near Moscow, left a deep impression. Besides listening to his several public speeches and symposiums, I, along with brothers Shu Wu, Tian Yu, Qi Yi, and Tu Zhi, individually visited him. I found him to be amiable and approachable, answering questions without hesitation. At first glance, he seemed like an ordinary farmer, but his mind was developed, his knowledge profound, and he possessed the art of speaking. Even in large gatherings of one or two thousand people, listening to him speak for two or three hours felt engaging and rarely tiring, a stark contrast to the repulsive atmosphere of the employed scholars from capitalist countries. This distinguished guest spoke with brotherly affection. He shared information about agricultural education and research in the Soviet Union and introduced general aspects of the Michurin doctrine, which are highly valuable for our learning. Therefore, I have noted some points for everyone's reference:

    (1)
    Firstly, he informed me that, unlike fifteen years ago, the agricultural colleges in Soviet universities are no longer affiliated with universities but are independently managed as agricultural academies. Their affiliation lies both with the Higher Education Ministry and the Agriculture Ministry. The Higher Education Ministry oversees policies and funding related to education, while the Agriculture Ministry or relevant ministries and commissions handle experimental research issues and funding proposed by the government, thus integrating research and education. This is entirely different from the old approach of our past agricultural colleges, where teaching was the sole focus. Agricultural academies offer five-year programs. The first year emphasizes basic subjects like mathematics, physics, and chemistry, as well as philosophy and three months of production practice (one month each in spring, summer, and autumn). Great importance is attached to practical work such as surveying, plant classification, and fieldwork. Examinations are strictly enforced each semester. Throughout the five years, 28 to 30 compulsory courses must be passed with examinations, and a thesis must be submitted and approved by the review committee to receive a diploma. To obtain a degree or candidate diploma, one must continue research for three years after graduation, submit a thesis, and pass a defense.

    He said that Soviet agricultural education is divided into three levels: primary, secondary, and higher. Primary agricultural schools have a four-year program, and admission requires students who have completed four years of primary school. They are taught practical knowledge of crops, forestry, horticulture, etc. Graduates primarily serve as cadres and technicians in collective farms; outstanding students may receive the Labor Hero Medal. These students can still pursue further education after three to five years of labor. Secondary agricultural schools, also known as specialized agricultural schools, have a four-year program, and admission requires students who have completed seven years of compulsory education. Graduates can work in collective farm tractor stations, etc. After three years of service with outstanding performance, they can also enter higher agricultural schools (agricultural academies) to study. Higher agricultural education institutions are the agricultural academies. They generally accept students who have completed ten years of education (i.e., after seven years of compulsory education, plus three years of high school). Except for graduates of specialized agricultural schools or ten-year schools with outstanding grades who can be admitted without examination, all others must pass a strict entrance examination. There are currently over ninety such higher agricultural schools throughout the Soviet Union, distributed in each province and border region to conduct education and research tailored to local needs. All students receive public funding or subsidies. The Timiryazev Agricultural Academy has an 85-year history and is located near Moscow, making it particularly crowded with applicants, so the examination is strict. This year, most of the admitted students are outstanding individuals who have received gold medals. Besides educational purposes, the academy's experimental research work is similar to that of the Lenin All-Union Academy of Agricultural Sciences. The Lenin All-Union Academy of Agricultural Sciences, established in 1922 as a new institution to expand agricultural research, has only twenty years of history. Its work does not include education, but its research and experiments are fully coordinated with the Timiryazev Agricultural Academy. The Lenin Agricultural Academy consists of eighteen research institutes throughout the Soviet Union.

    The teaching methods of Soviet agricultural academies include lectures, experiments, internships, practical work and study in experimental fields, and specialized scientific research. Generally, lectures and internships account for about 70% of the total time, and the remaining 30% is mainly devoted to actual production work. Each academic year lasts about ten and a half months, with a one and a half month break each year, including one month of summer vacation and half a month of winter vacation. The year is divided into two semesters, each with semester exams. During the five academic years, about 28 to 30 compulsory courses must be taken, with five or six elective courses available. For example, the compulsory courses for the agronomy department include: botany, plant physiology, crops, genetics and breeding, seed science, forestry, plant pathology, inorganic chemistry, organic chemistry, agricultural chemistry, mathematics, geology, physics, soil science, agronomy, surveying, meteorology, agricultural machinery, tractors, agricultural product processing, soil improvement (including drainage and irrigation), political economy, agricultural economics, Marxism-Leninism, farm organization and management, animals, livestock, animal physiology, animal husbandry, entomology, foreign languages (focusing on English and German), etc., with vegetables, fruit trees, beekeeping, and statistics as elective subjects. All departments require compulsory courses in biology and chemistry.

    Soviet students must be proficient in production skills, such as the use of tractors, fertilizer application, weeding, and other agricultural tools. They must be skilled and have insights to be considered qualified. Therefore, each student is often assigned an experimental plot for their internship. First and second-year students generally work on farms, while third and fourth-year students work in collective farms. Currently, there are 250,000 collective farms in the Soviet Union, with over 20 million peasant households participating, accounting for 95.6% of all farm households. They cultivate 99.2% of the country's cultivated land, making collective farms the main form of the Soviet rural economy.

    The Soviet Union pays great attention to advanced scientific research. For example, agricultural experts with practical experience can enroll in short-term advanced courses offered by research institutes for further study, such as livestock electrification, milk electrification, etc.

    The Soviet agricultural academies' educational research work is closely linked to actual production. In other words, all research is conducted in actual production. Guiding farmers in the problems they encounter is an important mission for agronomists. The educational research plans are determined by each agricultural academy themselves, but they must be approved by the Higher Education Ministry. This work is carried out by a committee organized by the most outstanding professors.

    When discussing agricultural economics, Mr. Stoletev emphasized that to be a good agricultural economist, one must first be a good agronomist. Therefore, at the Timiryazev Agricultural Academy, agricultural economics teaching and agronomy teaching are integrated. The courses for the first, second, and third years of the agricultural economics department are almost the same as those of the agronomy department. Agricultural economics courses are only taken from the fourth and fifth years. Agricultural economists must be proficient in Marxism-Leninism, focus on the study of agricultural economic history, and study both those in Europe and America who support or oppose Marx's theories.

    Regarding the question of how to promote the results of agricultural research to farmers, Mr. Stoletev said that this task is entirely undertaken by the Ministry of Agriculture in the Soviet Union. For example, after a professor submits research results to the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Agriculture sends them to a state-owned farm or collective farm for testing. If the experiment results in losses, the state bears the compensation. If it proves effective, it will be further promoted in the following year. After two or three years of testing, if the results are proven to be effective, they must be included in the national economic plan for implementation. Scholars who invent and conduct research that is proven to be effective in practice receive various forms of encouragement and respect. If such scholars publish anything further, collective farms will naturally flock to accept the experiments and promote the application of these inventions. Mr. Stoletev also reported a statement made by Stalin: "The government guarantees the best economic and administrative conditions for scientific workers, and we are confident that Soviet scientific workers can accomplish the tasks they set for themselves." Therefore, the responsibilities in Soviet agricultural construction are very clear. This planned scientific endeavor can be conveniently promoted to the masses.

    Mr. Stoletev also mentioned that livestock and veterinary medicine in the Soviet Union are developed separately, with separate veterinary colleges dedicated to solving practical problems. He also mentioned that the Soviet forest science field has two or three forest research institutes and three or four forest colleges. Agronomy students must also study forestry and surveying. One of the important tasks in the Soviet Union today is to accelerate the construction of six million hectares of protective forest belts. This great work demonstrates the determination of the Soviet people to transform nature. The tree species they promote for afforestation focus on useful trees, prioritizing fruit trees because the Soviet people believe they already have enough timber for construction and can even supply it to friendly countries. They now apply scientific management and utilization to existing forests, and the protection of forests is enshrined in law. To promote forestry, the Timiryazev Agricultural Academy had a regulation in its early days that each member of the academy must plant a certain number of trees in a designated location as a memorial. Now, this forest covers 300 hectares. The trees planted by older staff members have grown tall, and they can often point out their commemorative trees to the younger generation for admiration.

    (2)
    Regarding the debate in Soviet biological sciences, Mr. Stoletev gave a popular lecture to about one thousand students, teachers, and interested individuals on Double Tenth Day, analyzing it very clearly. He pointed out that there are two significantly different paths between the Soviet Michurin and Lysenko school of scholars and the European and American Weismann and Morgan school of scholars regarding the purpose of biological sciences. The focus of these two paths' debates not only intensified among researchers of biology but also raised great concerns among people who are not biologists. Because behind the debate between the two paths, there is a fundamentally different worldview. Therefore, starting from this point, the goals of biology can diverge into two different aspects. The goal of Michurin's biology is very clear: to liberate biological research, so that we can apply its laws, grasp nature, control nature, produce highly agricultural or livestock products that meet our needs, create new varieties or species that do not exist in the natural world, benefit people, and increase the cold resistance of crops, increase or prolong the survival of our human beings, etc. Weismann and Morgan's biology have not given a clear answer to the above goals. They only recognize the principle of the permanent immutability of organisms, that organisms in nature are inherently unequal, that people cannot understand nature, that the increase in population exceeds the speed of food increase, etc. Therefore, biological research is serving dark and reactionary forces invisibly.

    Mr. Stoletev further analyzed the viewpoint of biology:
    1.  Regarding the question of whether the species of animals or plants can be changed, Michurin said that it must change over time, while the Morgan school advocates that if it is not hybridized and maintains a purebred variety, it is permanently immutable. But we can know from the historical process that many varieties are undergoing changes and disappearances. After a certain animal or plant disappears, new varieties can be replaced and born, but the time is very long, and we are not easy to detect in the short term. However, scientific experiments can prove that its change is a fact even in the short term. Mr. Michurin has collected many examples to prove this.

    2.  Regarding the question of how the heredity of animals or plants can be changed, Michurin said that under the influence of changing living conditions, it also changes accordingly. For example, if a plant is planted in different environments, different varieties can be obtained after a considerable period. The varieties of various animals and plants are constantly undergoing changes under various living conditions. Morgan did not recognize the change of heredity at all. Even if there is any, it is a mutation, without a historical process, completely ignoring the influence of the living environment. This idea of ​​eternal immutability is also the most reactionary in philosophy, and even more unscientific in understanding nature.

    3.  Regarding the question of whether new organisms can be produced under the influence of various living conditions of animals and plants, and whether they can be inherited, Michurin said that it is entirely possible. If this effect does not exist, nature will not evolve. Weismann and Morgan scholars said that the acquired traits of organisms cannot be inherited. Everyone knows Weismann's experiment, which proved that it cannot be inherited by cutting off the tails of mice; but this tail cell of mice does not participate in the embryos and development of their next generation. The relationship between the tail of the parent and the offspring is extremely distant. Therefore, mechanical scars or defects cannot be compared with the problem of changes in the living body's physiology due to the influence of living conditions.

    4.  Regarding the question of whether the application of the above acquired inheritance in agricultural production can produce new varieties in a planned manner, Michurin said that it is possible. For example, wheat and fruit trees that could not be cultivated in the cold land of Siberia in the past, and grapes that could not be cultivated near Moscow, have now been changed by Michurin, and many varieties suitable for cultivation in these areas have been created. Michurin has also created colored cotton, which can prove the possibility of our control over nature, which is a fact that Weismann, Morgan and other scholars cannot do.

    The above-mentioned questions have clearly answered the differences between the Michurin and Morgan routes. Now that the progress of physics and chemistry has made it possible to understand nature. For example, in atomic energy, the fission of one atom can be changed into another atom. Can we similarly change some plants into other animals with our living substances? Michurin believes that this kind of thinking of changing into another animal is possible in principle. Morgan's theorists say it is impossible. Regarding the issue of changing one variety into another, Michurin is entirely based on experimental facts. For example, winter wheat can be turned into spring wheat after being treated at low temperatures for several generations, etc.

    Another important point is the difference between the above two routes: that is, Weismann and Morgan scholars believe that the rate of increase of organisms produced in nature is faster than the increase of their food, while Michurin believes that the more organisms there are, the more living conditions there are. This conclusion is based on facts, that is, the soil can be created by the plants themselves, and the more plants there are, the more soil is formed. The Timiryazev Agricultural Academy has conducted long-term experiments on a piece of land for forty years, cultivating it with different cultivation methods, but without planting any crops, and completely removing weeds. After forty years of continuous accumulation of experiments, this piece of soil can no longer grow any plants. After understanding these facts, can't we use the principles of biology to grasp nature and benefit mankind?

　　苏联农业生物学家斯托雷托夫给我的印象
    蔡邦华
    这次苏联的文化艺术科学工作者代表团来到北京访问，不仅参加我国开国盛典，又向各方展开了友谊的访问和演讲。就中代表之一斯托雷托夫先生，是个有名的植物生物科学的博士，莫斯科附近契姆里也则夫农业科学院院长。我除了听他好几次公开演讲和座谈之外，又和叔五、天宇、其益及涂治诸兄个别访问过他，觉得他和蔼可亲，不烦答问。初看好象个普通的农夫，可是他的头脑发达，学识渊博，加以有说话的艺术，虽在一两千人的大集会场所，一连听他演讲两三个钟头，也觉得津津有味，少有倦意，和一般从资本主义国家来的御用学者们讨厌气氛比较起来确是完全不同。这位贵宾说起话来，真好象兄弟般的可爱，他告诉我苏联农业教育和研究的情况，又介绍了米邱林学说的一般的情况值得我们学习的地方太多了，所以约略记了一些，以供大家参考：
    （一）
    首先他告诉我目前苏联的大学农学院，都不象在十五年以前的附设在大学里面，而是单独办理称为农业科学院了。它的隶属，一方为高等教育部，同时又为农业部。大凡与教育有关的方针和经费，由高等教育部统辖；为解决政府所提出的试验研究等问题和经费，由农业部或有关部、会担任，所以研究与教育合一。它与我国过去的农学院殆以教课为唯一任务的旧作风完全不同。农业科学院五年毕业，第一年注重数、理、化等基础学科以外，哲学及生产实习三个月（春夏秋各一个月），对测量实习、植物分类、野外实习等等实习工作极为重视，每学期严格执行考试。五年中必修课程二十八门至三十门，必须都经考试及格，提出论文经审查会通过，方给文凭。欲得学位、候补文凭者，于五年毕业后再继续研究三年，提出论文，通过辩论会始属有效。
    他说：苏联的农业教育分三个等级：即初等、中等及高等。初等农校修业年限四年，入学资格为修满四年制小学的学生，援以作物、森林、园艺等实际知识，毕业后主要担任集体农场干部和技工方面的工作；成绩特别优良者，可得劳动英雄奖章。此项学生，经三、五年劳动后，仍可升学。中等农校或称专门农校，修业年限四年，入学资格为修满七年制义务教育的学生。毕业后可入集体农场拖拉机站等处服务，服务满三年成绩优良者，也可入高等农校（农业科学院）攻读，所谓高等的农业教育机关，就是农业科学院，普通收修满十年制的学生（就是经过七年制义务教育之后再读三年高中的学生），除专门农校或十年制中学毕业成绩特优者，可免试入学外，余均须经过严格的入学考试，及格后方得入学。此项高等农校目前全苏有九十余所，分布于每省和各边区以便进行适合各地需要的教育和研究工作。所有学生均有公费或补助费。契姆里也则夫农业科学院，今年已有八十五周年的历史，它位于莫斯科附近，投考的学生特别拥挤，所以考试严格。今年入学的学生大部是得过金制奖状的优秀分子，该院除教育目的以外，其余试验研究工作和列宁全苏农业研究院相似。列宁全苏农业研究院创设于一九二二年为扩大农业研究新兴的机构，今年才有二十余年的历史。它的工作，不包括教育工作，其余研究试验，都和契姆里也则夫农业科学院是统力合作的。列宁农业院由全苏十八个研究院结合而成。
    苏联农业科学院的教学方法，分讲授、实验、实习、试验场所实际工作和学习，与专门作科学的研究等项，普通讲演与实习占全时间约百分之七十，其余百分之三十，大旨从事于实际生产工作。每学年为期约十个半月，每年休息一个半月，就中暑假一个月，寒假半个月，一年分二个学期，每学期均有学期考试。五个学年中，必修功课约二十八至三十门，其余可有五、六个选课，例如农艺系的必修功课：为植物、植物生理、作物、遗传选种、种子学、森林、植病、无机化学、有机化学、农艺化学、数学、地质、物理、土壤、农艺、测量、气象、农业机械、拖拉机、农产加工、土壤改良（包括排水灌溉）、政治经济、农业经济、马列主义、农场组织及管理、动物、家畜、动物生理、畜牧、昆虫、外国语（注重英德语）等，而以蔬菜、果树、养蜂、统计等为选修科目，各系对于生物和化学等功课，均为必修课。
    苏联的学生，对于生产学习必须精通，例如拖拉机的使用，施肥除草等工作，和其他农具的使用，均须熟练而有心得，方为合格。所以每一学生常分给试验地，作为他实习之用。一二年级的学生，一般在农场内工作，三四年级入集体农场工作。目下苏联的集体农场，全国有二十五万所，加入的农民二千多万户，即占全体农户百分之九十五点六。他们耕种的土地，占全国耕地面积百分之九十九点二，所以集体农场是苏联农村经济的主要形式。
    关于高深的科学研究，苏联极为注意，如农业专家已有实际经验者，可入研究所所开的短期性高级课程，以资深造，如畜牧电气化、牛奶电气化等等。
    苏联农业科学院教育研究工作，与实际生产的联系极为密切，换言之，一切研究，都在实际生产中进行着，农学家指导农民所发生的问题是一项重要使命。至于教育研究计划，都由各农业科学院自己决定，但须得高等教育部批准，该项工作，由最优秀的教授组织委员会行之。
    斯氏谈到农业经济学的一问题，他强调说：要做好的农业经济学家，首先要做一个好的农艺学家。所以在契姆里也则夫农业科学院内，农业经济教学和农艺教学联于一处。农经系起初的一、二、三年课程与农艺系殆属相同。从四五年起方才读农经课程。农经学家，尤须精通马列主义，注重农经历史的研究，并须对欧美赞成或反对马克思学说的都得研究。
    关于农业研究所得结果，如何推广到农民一个问题，斯氏说：此项任务在苏联完全由农业部担任。例如某教授将研究结果送达于农业部后，农业部就把他发给到某国营农场或集体农场试验，如因此项试验所遭致损失时，则由国家负担赔偿；如证明有效时，则于下年度更加推广；经二、三年试验结果都证明确实有效时，则须加入全国经济计划内推行，凡发明各项研究，实际被证明为有效的学者，可得种种鼓励和尊敬。此项学者，以后如再有所发表时，各方集体农场自然都能自动的趋之若鹜的来接受试验和推广此项发明的运用的。斯氏又报告了斯大林所说的一句话：“政府方面，对于科学工作者，保证经济、行政上的最好条件，我们确信苏联科学工作者就可以完成他们所提出的问题的任务。”所以在苏联的农业建设的责任是很分明的。此项有计划的科学事业，很方便的可以推广到群众方面去的。
    斯氏又谈到苏联的畜牧和兽医是分开发展的，另设有兽医学院，从事实际问题的解决；又谈到苏联森林学科，有二、三个森林研究院，另有三、四个森林学院，学农艺者亦须读森林和测量。苏联在目前的重要任务之一是进行赶造六百万公顷的防护林带，此项伟大的工作，是表现苏联人要改造自然的决心。他们推行造林的树种，注重在有用树木方面，首先重视果木的栽培，因为苏联人民估计他们的建筑用木材已经够用，并且到可以供给友邦使用的程度了。现在他们对于既有的森林，已适用科学管理和利用，对于保护森林一节，亦已载之于法律。契姆里也则夫农业科学院为提倡森林起见，很早时代就有一项规定：该院每一人员必须在指定地点栽树若干株，以作纪念；到现在此项林木，占地已达三百公顷。年老的工作人员所栽的树木，已经长大，常常可以把他的纪念树指示给年轻的人们去景仰了。
    （二）
    关于苏联生物科学的论战，斯托雷托夫氏又在双十节那天对我们约一千多名学生教员和有兴趣的人们作了一个通俗演讲，分析得非常清楚。他指示着关于生物科学的目的，苏联的米邱林和李森科一派学者与欧美的魏士孟和莫尔干一派学者间有二条显著不同的路线。这两条路线争论的焦点，不但影响于研究生物学的学者们使他益趋于尖锐化，并且对一般非生物学家的人们，也起了很大的关心。因为在两条路线争论的后面，有一根本的宇宙观的不同。所以由此点出发，使生物学的目标可能分歧为两个不同的方面。米邱林的生物学目标是很清楚的，把生物学的研究解放了，使吾人可以应用他的法则，把握自然，统制自然，生产出适合于吾人所需要的高度农产或畜产，创造自然界所没有的新品种或种类，造福于人们，能使农作物增加抵抗寒气的能力，增加或延长我们人类的生存力等等。魏士孟和莫尔干一派的生物学，对于上述目标并未能给予明确的答复，他们只承认生物永久不变的原则，自然界的生物，天然是不平等的，人们无法可以了解自然，人口增加是超过了食物增加的速度的等等，所以生物学的研究是无形中为黑暗的反动势力而服务了。
    斯氏更进一步对于生物学的观点，又作了分析的叙述：
    １、动物或植物的种是否可以改变的问题，米邱林说在时间的过程中要改变的，莫尔干一派则主张如不杂交，保持纯系的品种，是永久不变的。但我们从历史过程中可以知道，许多品种进行着改变和消灭；某种动物或植物消灭了，以后新的品种能代替而生，不过时间很长，吾人在短期内不容易察知；但从科学实验，即在短期间亦可证明它的改变是事实。米邱林氏曾集了许多实例加以证明。
    ２、动物或植物的遗传性，是如何能改变的问题，米邱林说：在生活条件改变的影响下，它也随着而改变的。如把一种植物种在不同环境下，经过相当时候，可得不同的品种。各种动植物的品种不断的在各种生活条件下进行着改变作用。莫尔干氏不承认改变遗传的一回事，即或有之，乃是突变，而无历史的过程，完全忽略了生活环境的影响。此项永不改变的思想，在哲学中亦是最反动的，在了解自然上更是非科学的。
    ３、动植物在各种生活条件影响下，是否可以发生新的生物，并且是否能遗传下去的问题，米邱林则说完全是可能的。如果此项作用没有的话，自然界就不会进化。魏士孟和莫尔干一派学者说，生物的后天性或获得性遗传是不可能的。大家知道魏士孟的试验，以切断鼠尾证明它不能遗传；但此项鼠尾细胞，并不参加它们下一代的胚胎和发育亲代的尾，和后代的关系是极疏远的。因此，机械的伤痕或残缺不能与因生活条件的影响使生活的身体生理上发生改变的问题所可同日而语的。
    ４、上项获得性的遗传，在农业生产中的应用是否可有计划的产生新品种一问题，米邱林则说是可能的。例如西伯利亚寒地，一向所不能栽培的小麦、果树，和莫斯科附近所不能栽培的葡萄，现在米邱林都把它们的向例改变了，已造成许多品种适合于此等地区的栽培。米邱林又创生出了有色棉，均可证明吾人统制自然的可能性，而为魏士孟、莫尔干等学者所不能办得到的事实。
    以上所述诸问题，已能明确解答米、莫两路线的不同处，现在物理化学的进步，已能了解自然。例如原子能的一种原子分裂，可变为另一种原子。我们有生命的物质，能否同样的变化某种植物，变为另一种某种动物？这种变为另一种动物的推想，在原则上米邱林都主张是可能的。而莫尔干论者，则谓不可能。关于某一品种改变为另一品种一问题，米邱林完全建立在实验的事实上。例如冬麦受低温处理，经若干代可变为春麦等等。
    又有一重要论点，为上述两路线不同处：就是魏士孟、莫尔干一派学者认为自然界产生的生物，它的增加速度比它们的食物的增加为快，而米邱林则谓生物愈多，生活条件亦愈多。此项论断，是有事实根据的，就是土壤可由植物自己来创造，植物愈多土壤形成就愈多。契姆里也则夫农业科学院，曾以一块土地经过四十年的长期试验，把不同耕种的方法来耕，但不种任何作物，并且也完全除去杂草，继续积了四十年的试验，到现在这块土壤已不能生长任何植物了。明了此等事实以后，我们利用生物学的原理，不是很可以把握自然，来造福于人群吗？
