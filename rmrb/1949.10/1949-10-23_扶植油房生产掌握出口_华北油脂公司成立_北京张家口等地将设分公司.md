　　Supporting Oil Mill Production and Controlling Exports
  　North China Oil Company Established
    Branches to be Set Up in Beijing, Zhangjiakou, and Other Places
    [Our Newspaper's News] The North China Oil Company was established in mid-September. After its establishment, the company held a branch manager meeting on September 17th, lasting a total of nine days. The meeting pointed out that under the general policy of developing production, prospering the economy, and strengthening urban-rural trade, more support should be given to oil mill production, and the use of machine pressing should be the future direction of oil industry production. However, given that manual oil mills still account for the absolute majority in terms of quantity, on the one hand, attention must be paid to the construction of machine oil factories, and on the other hand, manual oil mills must be vigorously supported, solving their financial difficulties, and giving them appropriate profits so that they can produce smoothly and achieve the general policy of developing production. At the same time, in order to vigorously support oil mill production and encourage farmers to grow more oil crops, it is necessary to correctly grasp oil prices, in accordance with the law of natural circulation of materials, in line with the principle of low starting point and high ending point, and low production area and high sales area, so that oil and rice have appropriate price ratios; furthermore, in order to achieve the goal of stabilizing oil prices, the branches in major cities must, under the guidance of the commercial bureau, cooperate with market management to absorb and sell edible oil. In the past, vegetable oil was mostly used for lighting in rural areas. In the future, kerosene must be sold in large quantities at low prices in rural areas so that farmers can switch to kerosene lamps, in order to achieve the goal of absorbing large amounts of vegetable oil and oil crops. Regarding management methods, the meeting proposed that attention must be paid to grasping the seasonality of production and transportation. In future export trade, vegetable oil should be the main product and oil crops the secondary product. During export, strict attention must be paid to quality standards, and only those that meet export specifications should be allowed to be exported, in order to establish the reputation of new China's state-owned trade in the international market. In addition, the meeting decided to establish seven branch companies under the North China Oil Company in Tangshan, Beijing, Zhangjiakou, Shijiazhuang, Xinxiang, Linfen, and Linqing, and thirteen sub-branch companies in Taiyuan, Bozhen, and other places.

　　扶植油房生产掌握出口
  　华北油脂公司成立
    北京张家口等地将设分公司
    【本报讯】华北油脂公司已于九月中旬成立，该公司成立后，曾于九月十七日召开分支公司经理会议，历时共九日。会议指出应在发展生产，繁荣经济，加强城乡贸易总方针下多扶植油房生产，改用机器榨油为今后油业生产的发展方向。惟在目前人工油房在数量上仍占绝对优势的情况下，一方面固要注意机器油厂的建设，另一方面也必须大力扶植人工油房，解决其资金上的困难，给予适当的利润，使之能顺利生产，达到发展生产的总方针。同时，为了大力扶植油房生产及鼓励农民多种油料作物，就必须正确掌握油价，根据物资自然流转规律，符合起点低终点高，产地低销地高的原则，使油米有适当的比价；又为了达到稳定油价的目的，各较大城市的分支公司必须在商业局指导之下配合市场管理去进行食油吸收与出售。过去农村多用植物油点灯，今后必须在农村以低价大量出售煤油，使农民改点煤油灯，才能达到大量吸收植物油与油料的目的。关于经营方法，会上提出必须注意掌握生产与运输的季节性，在今后出口贸易上应以植物油为主，油料为副，出口时必须严格注意质量标准，务以合乎出口规格的方准其出口，以期在国际市场上建立新中国国营贸易的信誉。此外会议并决定在华北油脂公司之下设唐山、北京、张家口、石家庄、新乡、临汾、临清等七个分公司与太原、泊镇等十三个支公司。（华新室）
