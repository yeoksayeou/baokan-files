　　Forever in Our Hearts
    Chen Bo'er
    You – our most respected friends, the delegation of great Soviet cultural, artistic, and scientific workers, arrived amidst the eager anticipation of the Chinese people; you – advanced socialist cultural warriors, grown from the ranks of the laboring people, calling yourselves "ordinary," yet possessing thirty-two years of rich experience in cultural development, have left us with precious teachings, and will now return home amidst the infinitely sincere farewell emotions of the Chinese people.
    You have, with practical actions and pleasant, clear voices, unreservedly educated us, enabling us to more broadly and deeply recognize the following truth:
    "If a person is loyal to his own nation, if he loves it, then his greatest happiness is to dedicate his whole heart to it, to elevate it to the highest peak of the culture of all mankind."
    Today, as the People's Republic of China has already been proclaimed, and "the Chinese people will enter into the great family of the world's people with a high level of culture," you were the first to extend a hand brimming with love to us, providing us with the greatest help and guidance in political, economic, and cultural aspects. We will certainly "learn, learn, and learn again, and advance tirelessly behind you in the worldwide tide of peace."
    You said: "...the days spent here will become the days of greatest happiness, forever in our hearts." And the happiness we feel is even more indescribable. We will better dedicate our whole hearts to the motherland and the oppressed people of the whole world.

　　永远留在我们心里
    陈波儿
    你们——我们最敬爱的朋友，伟大的苏联文化艺术科学工作者代表团，在中国人民的殷切翘望中来临；你们——从劳动人民队伍里生长出来，自称是“平凡”，而在文化发展上有着三十二年丰富经验的先进社会主义文化战士们，给我们留下了珍贵的教导，将在中国人民无限真诚的惜别情绪中归国了。
    你们用实际的行动和愉快而又明确的声音毫无卷色地教育了我们，使得我们更普遍、更深刻地进一步认识了下面的真理：
    “如果一个人忠实于自己的民族，如果他热爱它，那他最大的幸福，就是把他整个的心奉献给它，把它提高到全人类文化的最高峰。”
    今天，当中华人民共和国已经宣告成立，“中国人民将进入到高度文化的人民的世界大家庭”的时候，你们第一个把蕴满热爱的手伸向我们，在政治、经济和文化各方面给予了我们最大的帮助和指导，我们一定会，“学习、学习、再学习，在全世界和平浪潮中紧紧地跟在你们身后不懈地前进。
    你们说：“……留在这里的日子将成为最大幸福的日子，永远留在我们心里。”而我们所感到的幸福更是无法形容的，我们将更好地把整个的心奉献给祖国和全世界的被压迫人民。
