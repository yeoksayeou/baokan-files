Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 27th - The head of the Soviet cultural, artistic, and scientific workers delegation, Simonov, issued a written statement on behalf of the Soviet delegation at a press conference in Beijing this morning, bidding farewell to the Chinese people. The full text is as follows:

	The schedule of the Soviet cultural workers delegation's stay in the People's Democratic China is nearing its end. Our delegation, which came to China at the invitation of various Chinese social organizations, arrived in Beijing on the historically significant day for the Chinese people when Comrade Mao Zedong, the head of state of China, announced the establishment of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China. Thanks to the hospitality of our Chinese friends, we were able to witness the grand celebrations of this great event in the life of the Chinese people. Our delegation was invited by various Chinese social organizations to participate in the China Peace Congress and the inaugural meeting of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. We firmly believe that the convening of these two conferences in the initial days after the establishment of the People's Democratic government in China, as well as the participation of our Soviet cultural workers delegation, invited by various Chinese social organizations, in these two conferences, are equally significant events. The issue of further consolidating the friendship and cultural ties between our two great nations is inextricably linked to the need to defend peace worldwide, oppose imperialism, and especially the conspiracies of American imperialism to provoke a new war. If, on the one hand, consolidating the friendship between our nations is the greatest contribution to the cause of world peace, then, on the other hand, the joint struggle of cultural workers of our two great nations in defending peace is the greatest contribution to the cause of further consolidating the friendship between our two great nations. It is not without reason that Chinese cultural workers spoke of permanent friendship with the Soviet Union at the China Peace Congress and of the common struggle of our two great nations for peace at the inaugural meeting of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. Thanks to Stalin's policy of peace and friendship among nations, the issue of friendship has been resolved in such a way as it is now in the relations between the various nations and peoples of the Soviet Union, the peoples of the people's democratic countries, and the Chinese people; this is the first time in human history. For the first time in human history, these relations are based on such a sincere recognition of mutual equality, on such genuine sincerity in the expression of friendly feelings, and on such selfless assistance. For the first time in human history, all advanced countries governed by the people's government, and all advanced people in the world, are so widely united around the issue of defending peace. The instigators of a new war are for the first time so morally isolated and thoroughly exposed.
	Chinese cultural workers, representatives of the working people of People's Democratic China, emphasized the indivisibility of the two issues of friendship with the Soviet Union and the struggle for peace at the two conferences. In supporting friendship with the Soviet Union, they support world peace; and in supporting world peace, they support friendship with the Soviet Union. This is the main impression left in the minds of the members of our Soviet cultural workers delegation after participating in the work of the two conferences as guests. After the conclusion of the work of the two conferences, our delegation was invited to participate in a series of gatherings and meetings, all of which were convened to further consolidate Sino-Soviet cultural ties and expand the exchange of experiences in the cultural field. Members of our delegation participated in student gatherings at Peking University and Tsinghua University, in mass rallies of intellectuals, workers, and People's Liberation Army soldiers in Shanghai, and in numerous mass rallies of working people in Jinan, Nanjing, and Tianjin. In their speeches, members of our delegation touched upon various aspects of Soviet cultural life, and these speeches evoked a sincere and enthusiastic response from the audience, proving their great interest in the achievements of the Soviet Union in the cultural field. This vibrant interest is undoubtedly the greatest guarantee for the further extensive development of our cultural ties.
	The Soviet people's feelings of friendship towards the Chinese people did not arise today. For ten years, the Soviet people have repeatedly demonstrated their friendship towards the Chinese people and their warm sympathy for the Chinese people's struggle for liberation. On the other hand, feelings of friendship towards the Soviet Union and concern for its achievements have been a traditional feeling and a traditional concern among the Chinese working people and among all advanced Chinese intellectuals. As early as a quarter of a century ago, Dr. Sun Yat-sen raised the issue of the great significance of friendship with the Soviet Union for the Chinese people. But now, in our observation, interest in the Soviet Union has acquired a particularly large scale and a new nature due to the new conditions in the lives of the Chinese people. Under the present circumstances, after overthrowing the oppression of the imperialists and establishing a democratic government in China, a whole series of issues in Soviet cultural construction, as we have pointed out, have gained wide practical interest for our Chinese friends. The Chinese people, now that power has been transferred to the People's Democratic government, have broad possibilities for building an advanced culture under Chinese conditions. Naturally, the Chinese people are interested in the experience of our Soviet people in building an advanced culture under Soviet conditions. At all the mass rallies we attended, with the enthusiastic participation of workers, peasants, and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, two feelings were always expressed extremely clearly and deeply: feelings of friendship towards the Soviet people and feelings of interest in their achievements. Members of the Soviet delegation did their best to satisfy the interest of Chinese comrades in the cultural achievements of the Soviet Union and in the life and activities of the Soviet people, as expressed in their welcome to them. We have done our best to answer all the questions raised to us about the activities of Soviet cultural groups. At the same time, when we see the breadth and diversity of these interests, we, of course, clearly feel that the work of our delegation in this regard is only an initial and small contribution to the great cause of expanding cultural ties between the Soviet Union and China, and this cause requires many years of serious effort by the broad ranks of intellectuals in the Soviet Union and China.
	The Soviet delegation introduced some issues of Soviet cultural development to our Chinese friends, while on our own side, we were extremely concerned to examine the work of the cultural representatives of the new democratic China and the achievements of their activities in various fields. Thanks to the hospitality of the Chinese social organizations that invited us, we were able to visit many of China's largest schools, meet with professors and students, with educators, publishers, with workers of trade unions, women's and youth organizations, and with writers and artists. In our conversations with them, we were able to obtain answers to various aspects of modern Chinese cultural construction that we were concerned about. From these many conversations, which are difficult to describe one by one here, we have drawn a basic and universal impression: that there is a great upsurge of culture among the Chinese people and its intellectuals, the existence of broad prospects for future cultural development based on a solid realistic foundation, and the existence of a vast, democratic, and progressive force of Chinese intellectuals united around the basic tasks of cultural construction that conform to the urgent interests of the Chinese people.
	The young students of New China gave us a deep impression, filled with the spirit of anti-imperialism and filled with the lofty spirit of serving the liberated Chinese people who have overthrown imperialist oppression. Thanks to the hospitality of our Chinese friends, we were able to visit theaters, art exhibitions, to learn about modern and classical Chinese works of art, and to visit many historical monuments, which prove the great genius and great energy of the Chinese people under the most burdensome conditions of feudal oppression, who used their ingenious hands to create art relics of the greatest value that have survived this oppression and are immortal.
	In the next few days, we will bid farewell to our friends and leave the borders of the hospitable People's Republic of China. Before we depart, we would like to say a few words, that although we leave the borders of New China, we do not consider the work of our delegation to be completed: the second and very important part of the task lies before us. We will do our best to fulfill it. And the second part of the task, that is, to talk about everything we, the Soviet cultural workers, have seen here, all the profound impressions we have gained here, in our own country through articles, speeches, and reports. Naturally, what we will talk about first and foremost is everything about the new, revolutionary, and cultural workers of People's Democratic China that makes them enter the ranks of the world's advanced cultural workers. Soviet intellectuals and the entire Soviet people are deeply concerned about everything that is currently happening in the cultural field in China. They are concerned because they are friends who sincerely hope for the success of the Chinese people; they are concerned because they are comrades-in-arms, headed by the Soviet Union, fighting for the cause of peace; they are concerned because they are people who have steadfastly hoped for the victory of the Chinese people for many years and are now satisfied with this victory that the Chinese people have achieved. The fruits of this victory in the cultural field are deeply of concern to Soviet intellectuals and Soviet cultural workers. And we members of the Soviet delegation will not consider our work completed until we have done our best to tell everything we have seen here in our own country.
	Finally, we would like to take this opportunity, through the representatives of the Chinese press, to thank the Chinese laborers, workers, peasants, and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army who have warmly and sincerely welcomed us everywhere. We would like to thank people from all walks of life in China who have friendly introduced us to their work in the cultural field, who have helped us understand the achievements of this culture, and who have hosted us in universities, theaters, art workshops, trade unions, women's and youth organizations, in the countryside, and in factories. We thank them and hope that our visit is a modest contribution to the cause of further consolidating the friendship and cultural ties between cultural workers of the Soviet Union and China.
	We express our deep gratitude to Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the People's Republic of China! (End)

　　苏联文化代表团向中国人民告别            
   （西蒙诺夫在北京新闻记者招待会上发表书面谈话）
    【新华社北京二十七日电】苏联文化艺术科学工作者代表团团长西蒙诺夫，今日上午在北京新闻记者招待会上，代表苏联代表团发表书面谈话，向中国人民告别。全文如下：
    苏联文化工作者代表团在人民民主的中国停留的日程快要结束了。应中国各社会团体之请而来到中国的我们代表团，是在中国国家元首毛泽东同志宣布中华人民共和国中央人民政府成立这一对中国人民有历史意义的日子，来到北京的。承蒙中国朋友的款待，我们得以亲见中国人民生活中这一伟大事件的庆祝盛典。我们代表团受中国各社会团体之邀请，是为了参加中国保卫和平大会及中苏友好协会成立大会的。我们深信，在中国建立人民民主政权之后的最初日子里，这两个大会的召开，以及应中国各社会团体邀请而来的我们苏联文化工作者代表团之参加这两个大会，同是意义重大的事件。进一步巩固我们两大民族之间的友谊与文化联系的问题，与必需在全世界保卫和平、反对帝国主义、首先是美国帝国主义挑起新战争的阴谋的问题，乃是互相紧密联系着的。如果，从一方面说，巩固我们民族之间的友谊，是世界保卫和平事业中最伟大的供献，那么，从另一方面来说，在保卫和平中我们两大民族的文化工作者的共同斗争便是在进一步巩固我们两大民族之间友谊的事业中最伟大的供献。中国文化工作者在中国保卫和平大会上讲到与苏联的永久友谊，在中苏友好协会大会上讲到我们两大民族为和平事业的共同斗争，这不是没有原因的。由于斯大林的民族间和平与友谊的政策，友谊的问题有了象现在在苏联各民族与各人民民主国家的人民，与中国人民之间的关系中这样的解决，这还是人类历史上的第一次。在人类历史上这些关系是第一次建立在相互平等的这样诚心的承认上，建立在友谊感情的表现中的如此真心实意上，建立在这种大公无私的援助上。一切先进的、为人民政权所管理的国家，世界所有先进的人们，是人类历史上第一次这样广泛地团结在保卫和平问题的周围。新战争的挑拨者，是第一次这样在道义上被孤立，并被彻底揭穿。
    中国文化工作者们，人民民主中国的劳动人民的代表者们，在两个大会上强调与苏联的友好及为和平的斗争这两个问题的不可分割性。在拥护与苏联的友好，他们拥护全世界的和平；而在拥护全世界的和平时，他们拥护与苏联的友好。这就是我们苏联文化工作者代表团团员们作为来宾参加了两个大会工作之后留在脑海里的主要印象。在两个大会工作结束之后，我们代表团曾被邀参加了一系列集会和会议，这些集会和会议都是为进一步巩固中苏文化联系及扩大交换文化领域中的经验而召开的。我们代表团的团员参加过北大和清华的学生集会，在上海参加过知识分子、工人和人民解放军战士的群众大会，在济南、南京，和天津参加过多次劳动人民的群众大会。我们代表团团员们在其演说中曾触及到苏联文化生活的各个方面，这些演说引起了听众的真诚热烈的反应，证明他们对苏联在文化领域中的成就有极大的兴趣，这是中国劳动人民、知识分子、青年学生的最广大的群众所体验到的。这一活泼的兴趣，无条件地乃是进一步广泛发展我们文化联系的最大的保证。
    苏联人民对中国人民的友谊感情不是今天才产生的。十年来苏联人民不止一次地证明了他对中国人民的友谊及他对中国人民的解放斗争之热烈同情。另一方面，对苏联的友好感情，对其成就的关心，在中国劳动人民，在中国一切先进的知识分子方面，乃是一种传统的感情和传统的关心。还在四分之一世纪以前，孙逸仙博士就提出了关于与苏联友好这件事对中国人民的伟大意义的问题。但是现在对苏联的兴趣，照我们的观察，由于中国人民生活中的新的条件，已获得了特别广大的规模和新的性质。在现在的情况下，在推翻了帝国主义者的压迫之后，在中国建立了民主政权之后，苏联文化建设的整系列的问题，象我们所指出的，是获得了对我们中国的朋友们广泛的实际兴趣。中国人民，现在在政权转入人民民主政府手中之后，有着在中国条件下建设先进文化的广泛可能性，自然，中国人民对于我们苏维埃人民在苏联条件下所获得的先进文化建设的经验，感到兴趣。在我们所出席的、并有工人、农民及人民解放军的士兵们热烈参加的所有群众集会上，两种感情总是极其明显而深刻地表现着：对苏维埃人民的友好的感情及对其成就的兴趣的感情。苏联代表团团员们尽自己的力量来满足中国同志们在欢迎他们时所表现出来的对苏联文化成就，对苏维埃人们的生活与活动的那种兴趣。我们曾尽自己的可能来回答向我们提出的所有关于苏联文化团体活动的那些问题。同时，当我们看到这些兴趣的广泛性和多方面性的时候，我们，当然，明白地感觉到，我们代表团在这一方面上的工作，对于扩大苏联与中国文化联系这一巨大事业，只是一个最初的不大的供献，而这一事业，要求苏联和中国的知识分子广大的队伍作许多年的严重的努力。
    苏联代表团把苏联文化发展的若干问题介绍给我们的中国朋友们，同时在自己方面极端关心于考察新民主中国文化代表人物底工作和他们活动的各方面成就。由于邀请我们的中国社会团体的款待，我们能够访问中国许多最大的学校，同教授们和学生们，同教育工作者们、出版工作者们，同职工会、妇女和青年团体的工作者们，同作家们和艺术工作者们会面。在和他们的谈话中，我们能够得到我们所关心的现代中国文化建设的各方面问题的解答。从这些在这里很难逐一叙述的多次谈话中，我们得出了一个基本的普遍的印象，就是：在中国人民和它的知识分子中间文化大高潮的存在，依据坚固的现实基础的未来文化发展远大的前途的存在，中国知识分子之广大的、民主的、进步的力量围绕着符合中国人民迫切利益的文化建设底基本任务而团结的存在。
    新中国的青年学生给了我们一个深刻的印象，他们充满着反帝国主义的精神，充满了为解放了的、推翻帝国主义压迫的中国人民服务的崇高的精神。由于我们中国朋友的款待，我们得以访问戏院、艺术展览会，得以了解现代和古典的中国艺术作品，我们得以参观许多历史纪念物，这些纪念物证明在最沉重的封建压迫条件下的中国人民底伟大的天才和伟大的精力，他们用自己天才的手创造了经历这种压迫而具有不朽的最伟大价值的艺术纪念品。
    最近几天内，我们就要和我们的朋友们告别了，就要离开款待我们的中华人民共和国的国境了。我们在动身之前想说几句话，就是我们虽然离开新中国的国境，我们不认为我们代表团的工作已经完毕：在我们面前摆着的任务的第二个而很重要的部分。我们尽自己的力量努力完成它。而完成任务的第二部分，这就是说，要把我们，苏联文化工作者在这里所看见的一切，我们在这里所得到的一切深刻的印象，在我们自己国内以文章、演讲、报告讲出来。自然，我们首先要讲的，是一切关于新的、革命的、使人民民主中国的文化工作者进入世界先进的文化工作者的行列中的东西。苏联知识分子和全体苏联人民深深地关心目前在中国文化领域中发生的一切。他们之所以关心，是因为他们是衷心希望中国人民成功的朋友；他们之所以关心，是因为他们是以苏联为首的、为和平事业而斗争的战友；他们之所以关心，是因为他们是多年来坚定不移地希望中国人民胜利，而现在是为中国人民所获得的这种胜利而感到满意的人们。这一个胜利在文化领域中的果实，深深地为苏联知识分子、苏联文化工作者所关心。而我们苏联代表团团员，在我们没有尽自己力量把我们在这里所见的一切在本国讲述之前，我们的工作将不算完毕。
    最后，我们愿借助和经过中国新闻界代表们，向在各地热烈和诚挚地欢迎我们的中国劳动者、工人、农民、人民解放军战士们致谢，我们愿向中国各界人士致谢，他们友谊地把他们在文化领域中的工作介绍给我们，他们帮助我们了解这种文化的成就，他们曾在大学、戏院、艺术实习所，在工会、妇女青年的组织，在农村，在工厂招待我们。我们感谢他们，并且希望我们的访问，是我们对于进一步巩固中苏两国文化工作者之间的友谊和文化联系的事业的微薄贡献。
    我们向中华人民共和国主席毛泽东同志表示深深的感谢！（完）
