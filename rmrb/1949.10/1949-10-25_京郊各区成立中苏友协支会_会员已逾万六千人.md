    [Beijing News] After the establishment of the preparatory committees for the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association branches in the suburban districts of Beijing, extensive publicity was carried out regarding the significance of Sino-Soviet friendship, and membership was actively developed. As of now, the entire suburban area has registered 16,587 members. The preparatory work for the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association branches in the suburban districts has been successfully completed.
