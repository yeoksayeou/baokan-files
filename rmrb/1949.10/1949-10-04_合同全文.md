[Beijing News] In order to resolve the disputes between labor and management, representatives of the Beijing Municipal Conservancy Workers' Union and representatives of the trade association have signed a collective contract based on the industry's past practices and current situation, as follows:

	Article 1: Wages shall be paid based on the standard of Chang Corn in the ground (cleared monthly; those willing to convert the price can be paid according to the retail price of Chang Corn in the ground as published in the People's Daily on that day). Material factories that provide food and lodging will pay 260 catties per month; assistant factories and drivers who provide food and lodging will pay 230 catties per month; workers on the road who provide food and lodging will pay 220 catties per month; workers on the road who do not provide food will pay 350 catties per month; old workers and child laborers with weak working abilities shall not receive less than 150 catties per month. Equal pay for equal work is required.

	Article 2: The food issues should be implemented in accordance with past practices. Certain capitalists who previously canceled the food benefits from the 1st day of the fifth lunar month to the 20th day of the eighth lunar month, as well as the rewards on the first and fifteenth days of each month, should immediately restore the original regulations.

	Article 3: Welfare matters generally follow past practices. Cultural and educational expenses shall be 1.5% of the actual total monthly wage (calculated at 350 catties of corn per person per month), and labor insurance expenses shall be 3% of the actual total monthly wage (to be paid by the trade association to the labor union on the 25th of each month).

	Article 4: The capitalists have the right to hire and dismiss employees for the needs of production or work. However, they shall not dismiss employees on the pretext of personal grudges or because employees participate in labor unions or other political activities. If the contract is terminated midway, the labor party must be notified 15 days in advance, and severance pay of one to three months of actual wages must be paid according to the length of service and business conditions.

	Article 5: The effective period of this contract is six months (from September 1 of this year to the end of February next year). Within half a month before the expiration, both parties may negotiate and conclude a new contract. Before the new contract is concluded, this contract shall remain in effect.

	Article 6: This contract shall be strictly implemented by both parties after being approved by the Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau, and the right of interpretation belongs to the Labor Bureau.
