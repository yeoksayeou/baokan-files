　　The Black Rock Slope Coal Mine Chronicle (16)
　　　　　　Kang Zhuo
　　Fifteen　Strikes

　　It is said that Yu Bao was racking his brains on how to deal with the big kiln. But since Da San clarified things with him and then stirred up a commotion in the whole village, he did come up with a plan. After discussing it with Qian Dinao for a while, he felt that Da San could not be won over, so he might as well disrupt his work. If he could drive him away, then drive him away; if he couldn't, he would have to make him lose face! Once this was settled, Lin Bao and the others would definitely not dare to wholeheartedly partner with Xi Lu to open a kiln after the autumn harvest. Leaving Xi Lu alone, it was estimated that he wouldn't have that much capital and style to make such a big kiln. By that time, it would not be difficult to put the kiln under Ju Bao's name! This was the plan that Yu Bao and Qian Dinao had devised, and later Ju Bao also approved of their idea, so they immediately took action.
　　It is said that there was a large kiln in Liugou Village near Black Rock Slope that was constantly operating, and there were also kiln workers from Black Rock Slope working there. Niu Bao's sister-in-law was from Liugou, so Yu Bao sent that woman to Liugou to spread bad words about Da San. Yu Bao also asked Niu Bao to throw a tantrum in front of the villagers and subtly stab Da San with his words. Furthermore, among the kiln workers who worked in the big kiln in the village, there were also some mischievous fellows who had been digging earthen kilns all their lives, doing whatever they wanted on weekdays, being rascals, and unable to bear Da San's strict rules. They had also been reprimanded by Da San and seen his face when they were working, so even if they didn't say anything, they always felt a little unconvinced in their hearts. Yu Bao knew these people very well, so he personally came forward and couldn't help but provoke them a bit. In addition, Qian Dinao colluded with Tai Cheng, who managed the earthen kilns with Ju Bao, to help secretly. As a result, people in Black Rock Slope Village gradually started whispering in their ears while chatting, saying things like: "Da San wants to leave! I heard that he's afraid the ventilation shaft won't work after the autumn harvest!" "Da San is said to be a bit lacking in the earthen kilns. Originally, the kiln is a business of water and fire, and it's not easy to ventilate a shaft with your eyes closed! Besides, he's only used to working in machine kilns!" "I heard that Da San's skills in machine kilns are also average! Looking at his dress and posture, he can only say a few words! He's not very capable when it comes to doing practical work!"... Commenting on people's strengths and weaknesses in front of and behind their backs, it was originally one person speaking and everyone else adding to it. Later, some people even said: "What kind of kiln worker is Da San? Humph! He has gold teeth, wears a hat, drinks fine tea, and wears cool socks. He's really something! He's almost on par with our old man Ju Bao, serving as the top leader and managing official affairs for us!" "Wow! Top leader? That's really great! But he doesn't even believe in the Old Lord! He didn't kowtow to the Old Lord when the kiln opened last year." With everyone adding their own details, even the gossip from the Liugou family, "Da San is interested in Bai Quan's family!" gradually began to spread quietly. Fortunately, Da San couldn't hear these words for the time being, so nothing happened.
　　However, as words went back and forth, more and more people heard them. Some honest kiln workers always wanted Da San to work well in the village and turn the big kiln into a good long-term rice bowl. They felt uncomfortable when they heard these words. They couldn't figure out what was going on, didn't dare to spread the word, didn't dare to ask anyone for details, and didn't dare to tell Da San what they had heard. They just felt that there must be something going on that would cause trouble, so they all sighed secretly, fearing this and that, without saying a word. In this way, almost no one went to Da San's house to rest and chat after that, even Little Foreign Devil didn't go, and the Liugou family had already taken back their marriage proposal. At this time, the first weeding of the fields was over, and Da San had nothing to do. He was lonely and deserted. Every day, he would go to the slope opposite the village to squat for a while, looking at the mountain's terrain and coal seams of the big kiln, or he would go home and lie down for a while. Later, he even mentioned to Xi Lu that he wanted Yu Bao to do it, but Xi Lu refused no matter what. He also went to Yu Bao and asked Yu Bao to take over for him, but Yu Bao pretended to be sincere and begged him earnestly to continue working. He was very angry and really wanted to just leave, but he felt that it wasn't appropriate. And if he really wanted to leave, he seemed a little reluctant to leave this kiln. He also knew that there were indeed many families in the village who sincerely hoped that he would make the kiln bigger and better, so that they could have a long-term business to do. If he really left, he would be letting down these householders! Alas! Da San had no choice but to sulk alone. But he couldn't rest assured and was so anxious that he couldn't sleep at night.
　　Furthermore, the villagers' discussions about Da San gradually reached Shuan Cheng's ears, and Shuan Cheng felt very sad when he heard them. He wanted to explain to people, but he couldn't say anything. He also wanted to think of a way to deal with Da San's situation, but he couldn't think of a way either. He pondered for several days, and finally he had no choice but to decide to discuss it with Da San when they went to the fields together. But he was afraid that Da San would have a foolish temper, so he started by saying: "Uncle Da San, I have something to tell you again. I don't know if you've heard it? But you're not allowed to be angry when I say it." Da San said: "Little brother! You're so young, and you're still so cautious? Say it! Anyway, I, Zhang Yuanlu, am just like this. As long as you tell the truth, even if your words really harm me, I will thank you!" Shuan Cheng felt both sour and sweet in his heart when he heard these words. He couldn't describe the feeling, so he told him all the gossip about him in the village. After Da San heard this, he snorted and said: "What's this! Although I, Zhang Yuanlu, may not be able to ventilate the shaft, I was born to work in the kiln. I only know how to work hard! I'm sandwiched between four black stones in the coal pit, and I can eat it any day for more than twenty years, but I've never been afraid! Who doesn't know that I want Yu Bao to do it for the sake of not competing with the fellow craftsmen! As for believing in the Old Lord or not, what's there to say! Anyway, whoever can make a living, isn't that okay? Besides, it's not like I don't worship the Old Lord. As for the matter with Bai Quan's family, that's all fabricated by people. I've said it before, ignore it! Little brother! You said that well! I thank you! Humph! Whoever has the ability, let him tell me to my face! I don't care about behind-the-back talk!" But despite this, Da San was still a little uneasy. He didn't say anything more that day and quickly pressed down the gourd vines and went back.
　　Shuan Cheng was also afraid that something would happen to Da San. That night, he quietly went to Da San's house to see what was going on, hoping to chat a bit and ease Da San's mind. He didn't expect Da San's older brother to be squatting there all night, not speaking and not leaving. Shuan Cheng stayed for a long time and, seeing that it was inconvenient to talk, he left. Da San originally wanted to talk to Shuan Cheng too, but he was held back by his brother and didn't say anything. He only felt a stuffiness in his heart. After Shuan Cheng left, he lay down on the kang, ignoring his brother.

　　黑石坡煤窑演义（１６）
    康濯
    十五　打击
    且说玉宝正想不出好法来对付大窑，但自从大三跟他把事情挑明了，又浑村乱嚷乱说以后，他倒有了点办法。他和乾大脑商量了一阵，觉得大三这人拉拢不上，就干脆捣他的乱，能撵走便撵走他，撵不走嘛也得闹他个抬不起头！这么一咯揽，秋后林宝那些人准不敢痛痛快快跟喜禄碰股子开窑的，丢下喜禄一个人，估量他也不准会有那么大的垫本和派头来闹那么大的个窑；到那时候，要把窑闹到聚宝老人家名下，就不难办了！这就是玉宝和乾大脑计议好的主意，后来聚宝也赞成他们这个主意，他们便立时下手。
    却说黑石坡左近的柳沟村，有个常年不断的大窑，黑石坡也有窑黑在那里动弹；牛宝他嫂是柳沟的妈家，玉宝就派那女人去柳沟，窜通着说大三的坏话。玉宝又让牛宝在本村人前人后耍个脾气，说话当中刺大三两下。再说村里下大窑的窑黑里头，也有几个跳皮家伙，刨一辈子土窑，平日爱干啥就干啥，流里流气，受不了大三那严紧的规章，动弹的时候又挨过大三的训，见过大三的脸色，嘴里没话说吧，心里头总有些不服气；这些人玉宝都摸得很清，他便自己出马，短不了给他们挑拨两下。此外，乾大脑又窜连上跟聚宝经管土窑的泰成，给暗里帮帮腔。这么一来，黑石坡村里就慢慢有人在闲捣拉当中，咬耳朵说什么：“大三想走哩！听说他是怕秋后风筒透不成！”“大三在土窑上头，听说就是差点子。本来嘛，窑里头水火营生，黑着两眼透个风筒，好容易！再说他也只下惯了机器窑！”“听人说，大三机器窑的把式也平常！看他那穿戴那架势，他也只是能说两句！动手动脚实打实干的，他能耐也不大！”……人前人后评论人的长短，本来就一人说众人添，后来，还有人说：“大三那股劲，哪一点象个窑黑？哼！镶金牙戴礼帽，喝细茶穿凉袜，见天白面酒肉不离嘴的，人家可牛皮啦！人家快跟咱聚宝老人家平起平坐，给咱顶社首管官事哩！”“嚯！顶社首？那可正经是好样的！可人家连老君爷也不信哩！去年开窑那会，他就没给老君爷叩头。”这么你添我凑，就连柳沟家瞎说的话：“大三对白泉家有意哩！”慢慢地竟也有人悄悄传说。好在这些话大三一时也听不见，倒没出什么事。
    不过，话来话往，听见的人慢慢多了。有些老实窑黑，总想大三在村里好好干着，把大窑闹成个长年永辈的好饭碗子的，他们听了这些话，不免心中难受；他们闹不清是怎么回事，也不敢把话传开，又不敢跟人打问个底细，更不敢把听到的话语告给大三，只是觉着这内里准有什么招灾惹祸的事，就都暗暗里叹息两声，怕前怕后，不言不语。就这样，自后村里差不多就没什么人去大三家歇着捣拉了，连小洋鬼也不去，柳沟家也早把说亲的事收回不说了。这时地里锄过了头遍草，大三没什么事，冷冷清清地，每日里就一个人去村子对面坡梁上圪＠一会，看看大窑的山势炭脉，要不就回家躺一阵。他后来还找喜禄提过要让玉宝干，喜禄却怎么也不答应；他又找过玉宝，让玉宝接替他，玉宝却装作一片诚心，千求万请地让他一定干下去。他挺生气，真想硬走了了事，但又觉得那不怎么合适；而且真的要走吧，他又好象有点舍不得这窑；他也知道村里的确还有不少人家，是实心实意地指望他把这窑闹得更大更好，好闹个长远营生干；这要真走了吧，还就是对不起这些当家子哩！唉！大三没有办法，只好一个人闷着；可又放心不下，直急得黑家睡也睡不着。
    再说村里人们议论大三的话，慢慢传到了拴成耳里，拴成听了很难过。他想给人家解释解释，却说不出话；他又想给大三的景况想个对付办法，却也想不出法。他捉摸了好几天，最后也只好在跟大三一道上地的时候，决意和大三商议商议；但他又怕大三发傻脾气，一开头就这么说：“大三叔，我又有话要告你，不知你听说过没有？可你不兴生气，我才说。”大三道：“小兄弟！你这么不大点年岁，还这样顾前顾后？说吧！反正我张远禄就这么股劲，只要你说直话，你的话就真个害了我，我也要谢你哩！”拴成听了这话，心中又酸又甜，说不出怎么股滋味，就把村里人们对他的闲话都告给了。大三听罢，鼻子一哼道：“这算什么！我张远禄虽说不准能透开风筒，可这窑底下营生，我生就了就只知道卖命干！煤坑里上下左右四块黑石头夹着我一块肉，我二十来年哪一天也能吃，可就是没怕过！谁不知道我要让玉宝干是为的同行把式不相争！要说老君爷信不信的，那有什么说头！反正谁能干出营生，不就行么？再说我也不是不拜老君爷的，白泉家的事嘛，那起根就是人们胡编，我早说过的，不理球它！小兄弟！你这话说得好！我谢你！哼！人们谁有本领，让他当面跟我说吧！背后话，我管球它哩！”但尽管这样，大三总还有点不安心，他这天再没多说什么话，快快地压完了窝瓜蔓，就回去了。
    拴成又怕大三出事，这天黑夜，他就一个人悄悄上大三家去探探风声，想顺便捣拉捣拉，宽宽大三的心。不想大三他老二也在那里整整圪＠了一黑夜，不说话，也不走，拴成呆了半天，见说话不便，也就走了。大三原本也想跟拴成说说话，也是碍着他哥，没说什么，只觉心中发闷，等拴成走了，他就往炕上一躺，连他哥也不管了。
