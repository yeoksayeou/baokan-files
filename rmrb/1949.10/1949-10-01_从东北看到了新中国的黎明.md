　　Seeing the Dawn of New China from the Northeast

　　We've returned from the Northeast, and people ask, "What did you see in the Northeast?"

　　Indeed, we saw many things, many things we had never seen before.

　　The Kuomintang bandit gang were experts at destruction, leaving us dilapidated houses, piles of rusty scrap iron, and machines torn to pieces in the Northeast. Weeds grew taller than people in the factory area, birds built nests on the chimneys, and crows cried there. They thought we would be helpless.

　　But our people came. We were not discouraged. We said, let's break through this difficulty. Let's do it ourselves. Sure enough, our call immediately received a strong response from the workers.

　　So we saw workers secretly contributing machine parts to the factory without condition, hiding it from their wives.

　　So we saw workers searching through the wilderness and piles of scrap iron, waking up those sleeping machines.

　　The Kuomintang dismantled machines and moved them to the mountains to build bunkers, engaging in a war to kill the people, while our workers dismantled these bunkers again, and moved the buried machines back to the factory.

　　The boiler was broken, and the engineers hadn't even figured out a solution, but the old workers next to the boiler were already secretly planning, and stayed up for three days and nights to find a way to fix it.

　　In just eleven short months, the factory was revived in our hands. The chimneys were emitting long plumes of smoke. The fire in the iron furnace was roaring, the steam was boiling, the machines were singing, and the water was happily gurgling in the cooling tower.

　　And the workers were engaged in production competitions next to the furnace, on the cranes, and in the mines. Whoever produced the most was a hero and was most admired by their comrades.

　　The Communist Party said that everything should rely on the working class, and the working class really took on the task of production and construction with the qualifications of masters, and won the victory in the first battle.

　　※※　　　　　　　　※※　　　　　　　　※※

　　In Harbin, we visited the Xinhuangfang Farm attached to the Northeast Agricultural College. After a long period of war, all the gardens, fruit trees, and cultivated land were abandoned. Weeds were growing wildly, and foxes were stretching their long noses in the grass. But our people came. In March 1948, an honorary soldier who had retired from the People's Liberation Army brought a group of partners and pointed to the wasteland, saying, let's work here. For more than half a year, hoes and sickles never rested for a minute. The summer sun scorched their skin, and sudden rain washed the hot sweat off their backs. When winter came, the Siberian wind brought heavy snow. They didn't have time to build houses, so they dug a pit in the ground to live in, but they never stopped working in the frozen land.

　　Now they have reclaimed more than 1,000 mu of paddy fields, more than 1,000 hectares of dry land, raised more than 14,000 "Liexiang" chickens, more than 80 dairy cows, more than 300 rabbits, and more than 40 breeding pigs. Beautiful offices and dormitories stand there, welcoming the summer breeze. Cowsheds and chicken coops have also been built, and the glass on the windows reflects the sunlight brightly. In the fields, sorghum and corn hang with full ears, and watermelons stick out their round bellies, tempting passers-by. Laying hens sing happily in the chicken coops. More than 20 soil shredders, seeders, and harvesters have also started running. During the harvest, farmers sit on the machine platforms, harvesting wheat and singing turned-over ditties.

　　In just a year and a half, except for some equipment, they have not received any public subsidies. They have overcome many difficulties with the spirit of the People's Liberation Army fighting on the front lines, and created this entire farm with the accumulation of labor.

　　Just think about it, on the north bank of the Songhua River, there are endless plains, and thousands of miles of fertile land have not yet been cultivated. They are waiting for people's labor. So this farm is just a demonstration. As can be imagined, as long as three to five years pass, we can see the plains of this northern country piled with endless golden wheat, and countless Michurin orchards will be flashing golden red fruits near the Songhua River.

　　In the early eighteenth century, a large number of Europeans went to North America to reclaim wasteland. This vast wilderness created the conditions for capitalist prosperity. But today we are no longer taking the capitalist road. We are taking the road of the Chinese people themselves. In this area, we can engage in collective agricultural management from the beginning.

　　※※　　　　　　　　※※　　　　　　　　※※

　　Now, let's talk about literature and art.

　　In the Northeast, we saw workers covered in grease, writing scripts and performing plays themselves. Workers not only love art, but also create art. The goddess of art is no longer the decoration of the exploiters, but the close friend of the laborers.

　　We saw young men and women holding a passion, worshipping workers as masters next to the hot furnace. Intellectuals have undergone a complete transformation, and thus their skills are integrated into the wisdom of the laborers, giving birth to a new type of intellectual.

　　We saw the old artists, who had always lived in the fog of ignorance, performing plays of loyal ministers, filial sons, virtuous women, or talented scholars and beautiful women, or salacious short plays; and now they have opened their eyes and seen the sunlight. They sing the praises of historical people's heroes, perform the soldiers who dedicate themselves to the revolution, shed tears for poor women, and express their feelings for the suffering.

　　We saw a labor hero 300 meters below the mine, standing on the podium reporting his struggle experience. His speech was full of the passion of the laborers, bursting with figurative poetic verses. There is transparent amber in the coal seam, and today the amber of man has really had the opportunity to shine in front of everyone. (To be continued)

### 从东北看到了新中国的黎明

　　从东北看到了新中国的黎明
    我们从东北回来了，有人问：“你们在东北看到了些什么呢？”
    是的，我们的确看到了许多东西，许多从来没有看见的东西。
    国民党匪帮是破坏专家，他们在东北留给了我们一些破烂的房子，一堆堆生锈的废铁，拆得七零八落的机器。工厂区野草长得比人还高，烟囱上小鸟在那里结巢，乌鸦在那里啼哭。他们以为这样我们就没有办法了。
    可是我们的人来了，我们并不颓丧，我们说：冲破这个困难吧。让我们自己动起手来干吧。果然，我们的号召立即得到了工人方面强烈的响应。
    于是我们看见了工人们瞒着自己的妻子，偷偷地把机器的零件，无条件的贡献到工厂中来。
    于是我们看见了工人们在荒烟蔓草里面、废铁堆中找来找去，把那些睡眠着的机器摇醒。
    国民党把机器拆下来搬到山上去建筑碉堡，从事于杀害人民的战争，而我们的工友们则把这些碉堡再拆下来，把埋没了许久的机器重新搬回到工厂里面去。
    锅炉坏了，工程师都还没有想好办法，但是锅炉旁边的老工人，早就在那里暗中计划，为了想办法补救，三天三夜没有睡眠。
    短短的十一个月的时间，工厂就在我们的手中复活起来了。烟囱在冒着长长的烟。铁炉里的火在呼啸，蒸汽在沸腾，机器在歌唱，流水在冷却塔里作着愉快的哗笑。
    而工人们也就在火炉旁边，吊车上面，矿井底下作着生产竞赛。谁生产最多的，就是英雄，就最受伙伴们崇拜。
    共产党说，一切要依靠工人阶级，而工人阶级也就真的以主人的资格担负起了生产建设的任务，在第一个战役中获得了胜利了。
    　　※※　　　　　　　　※※　　　　　　　　※※
    在哈尔滨，我们参观了东北农学院附设的新香坊农场。经过长期的战争，一切的园林，果树，耕地都荒废了，野草在那里蔓生，狐狸在草丛里伸着它的长长的鼻子。可是我们的人来了。一九四八年三月间，一个解放军退役下来的荣誉军人带来了一批伙伴，指着荒地说，让我们就在这里工作罢。半年多的时间，锄头和镰刀从来都没有一分钟的休息，夏天的太阳灼热着他们的皮肤，骤雨冲洗着他们背脊上的热汗。冬天来了，西比利亚的风吹来了漫天大雪，他们还来不及盖造住的房子，于是他们就挖了一个土坑住下来，可是就在冰天雪地里他们从来也没有停止过工作。
    到了现在他们已开辟了一千多亩的水田，一千多顷的旱地，养了一万四千多只的“列巷”鸡，八十多头的乳牛，三数百只兔子，四十多头种猪。漂亮的办事室和寄宿舍站在那里迎着夏日的和风，牛舍鸡舍也建造起来了，窗子上的玻璃亮晶晶地反射着太阳的光芒。田地里高粱玉米垂着一串串饱满的穗子，西瓜挺着圆圆的肚子诱惑着来往的过客。下了蛋的母鸡在鸡舍里快乐地歌唱。二十多台的碎土机、播种机、割麦机也已经转动起来。在收割的时候，农民们坐在机台上，一面割麦一面唱着翻身小调。
    才短短一年半的时间，除了一部分设备外，并没有得到任何公家的津贴，他们就这样以解放军在前线作战的精神克服了许多困难，用劳动的积累来创造了这整个农场。
    试想想看吧，松花江北岸，还有着无尽的平原，千百里的沃野还没有人耕，它们正等待着人们的劳力。所以这个农场不过是一个示范。可以想象得到的，只要经过三五年的时间，我们就可以看见这北国的平原，堆满了一望无际的黄金般的麦子，无数的米丘林的果园会在松花江附近，闪烁着金红的果实。
    在十八世纪初期，大量的欧洲人曾跑到北美洲去垦荒，这广阔的原野，造成了资本主义繁荣的条件。可是今天我们走的已经不是资本主义的道路，我们走的是中国人民自己的道路，在这个地区里，我们一开始就可以从事于农业的集体经营。
    　　※※　　　　　　　　※※　　　　　　　　※※
    现在，再从文学艺术方面来说吧。
    在东北我们看见了满身油腻的工人们，自己也动手来写剧本了，上台演戏了。工人们不仅爱好艺术，而且在创造艺术。艺术的女神已经不是剥削者的装饰品，而是劳动者的亲密的友人。
    我们看见了怀抱着一股热情的青年男女，在炽热的火炉旁边向工人拜师父。知识分子经过了脱胎换骨，于是也就以他们的技巧溶会在劳动者的智慧里面，诞生出知识分子的新型。
    我们看见了旧的艺人们，他们一向是生活在愚昧底迷雾里面，演的戏都是忠臣、孝子、节妇，或者是才子佳人或者是打情卖俏的诲淫短剧；而现在他们已打开了眼睛看见了阳光。他们歌颂着历史上人民的英雄，表演着献身革命中的战士，为贫女洒泪，为苦难者抒情。
    我们看见了在三百米矿井底下的劳动英雄，他站在主席台上报告着他的奋斗的经历，他的演说充满着劳动者的激情，迸发着形象化的诗句。煤层里有着透明的琥珀，而今天人底琥珀却真的有了机会在众人面前吐着光辉。　　（未完）
