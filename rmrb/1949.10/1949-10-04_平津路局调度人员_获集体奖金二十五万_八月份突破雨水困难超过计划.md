　　Tianjin-Beijing Railway Bureau Dispatchers
   　Awarded Collective Bonus of 250,000
    August Overcame Rain Difficulties, Exceeded Plan
    [Our Dispatch] The Tianjin-Beijing Railway Bureau's dispatch personnel have been working actively and have been awarded a collective bonus of 250,000. Since its establishment, the Tianjin-Beijing Railway Bureau's transportation performance has been increasing month by month. Since the implementation of the new train operation system (responsibility system), work has progressed even faster. Although affected by flood damage in August, with the meticulous planning and flexible application of all dispatch offices in the bureau, tight control, and the strong cooperation of traffic personnel at various stations, they achieved tight loading and quick unloading, reduced station stop times, accelerated technical speeds, and improved turnover rates, overcoming the difficulty of insufficient freight cars. With 85% of the available cars, they achieved 102% usage and 104% in tons sent, all exceeding the original plan. This improved transportation performance (exceeding 35,000 tons). To reward those who have contributed, the Railway Bureau has issued a collective bonus of 250,000 to the dispatch personnel and called on everyone to continue their efforts, learn with humility, and further improve transportation efficiency.
