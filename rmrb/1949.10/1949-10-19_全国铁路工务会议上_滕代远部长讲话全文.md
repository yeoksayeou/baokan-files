Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Eighteenth: The full text of Minister of Railways Teng Daiyuan's speech at the National Railway Engineering Conference on the 17th is as follows:

Comrades: It has been six months since the Second Railway Engineering Conference in April of this year. During this period, comrades have done a lot of work, and there have been great changes in the country during these six months. The most obvious is the convening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). At this conference, the Organic Law of the CPPCC, the Organic Law of the Central People's Government, and the Common Program were discussed and approved, which is also the Great Charter of the People's Republic of China. The conference produced the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao announced the establishment of the People's Republic of China to the people of the whole country and the world. Soon after this announcement was issued, it was quickly recognized by the socialist country, the Soviet Union, which immediately sent Roshchin as ambassador. Within four days, the new democratic countries successively recognized it. This is an unprecedented major event in Chinese history. During this period, our nearly 500,000 railway workers accepted the task given to us by Chairman Mao: "Wherever the People's Liberation Army fights, our railway will be built to support the front line and advance, to ensure that the old liberated areas support the new liberated areas, and to ensure the exchange of materials between rural and urban areas." With the victorious advance of the People's Liberation Army and the help of the party, government, army, and people along the route, we participated day and night in this great restoration and construction work. By the end of September, 5,446 kilometers of railway lines had been repaired, ensuring the advance of the army. There are still many errors and shortcomings in our work, and we must correct them in time. This meeting is to summarize the work of railway engineering from April of this year to the present, to discuss the responsibility system for road maintenance, and how to adopt the new Soviet experience in road maintenance. We have already adopted it in the Northeast and achieved good results. The reason why the People's Railway has been restored so quickly this year is primarily due to the assistance from the Soviet Union in all aspects. Soviet experts patiently shared their experience and knowledge with us. The Soviet Union provided us with 500 kilometers of new rails and accessories and sent experts with the most experience in repairing railways during World War II to New China. They followed the progress of the revolutionary situation, from outside the customs to inside the customs, regardless of hardship, difficulty, and danger, to help us, unconditionally, with the spirit of internationalism. We should thank the Soviet government and the Soviet experts for this.

This meeting will decide on the work plan for railway engineering in November and December of this year and in 1950, and I hope everyone will discuss it carefully and complete this plan.

The Ministry of Railways is newly established, and in its work, it has not yet been able to fully exert its role and strength. We have 30,300 operational vehicles and 9,600 non-operational vehicles, and we must find ways to revive the dead vehicles. Currently, 7,240 vehicles are loaded every day, with a daily output of 227,200 tons. With the sea routes being blockaded, we opened the direct Beijing-Shanghai line, which had been closed for twelve years, and transported more than 810,000 tons of coal and grain to the south, which played a certain role in stabilizing prices after the liberation of Nanjing and Shanghai. Currently, the turnover rate in transportation is: four days in the Northeast, four days in the North, and three and a half days in the South. We must increase speed, eliminate slow speeds, and reduce the turnover rate. The first and most important thing is to maintain the roads well.

Next year, we plan to load 9,400 to 10,000 vehicles, with 39,500 operational vehicles. To accomplish this requirement, road maintenance and restoration are the most important. Therefore, the Engineering Bureau has successively sent ten groups to various bureaus to understand the situation. Minister Lü and the Director of the Track Section of the Engineering Bureau have inspected Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, Qingdao, and other places. Li Liang, Deputy Director of the Engineering Bureau, accompanied me to the Northeast for inspection. Li Panming, Deputy Director of the Engineering Department of the Railway Corps, supervised the repair of the Huai River and the Tongguan-Luoyang sections. After the Soviet experts arrived in Beijing, seventeen comrades were dispatched with Li Panming and Li Liang to inspect the Luoyang-Tongguan section and the Yuehan Railway and supervise the repairs on-site. On October 5th, Soviet and Chinese experts went to various bureaus in the North to understand the condition of the lines, seeing both shortcomings and progress. The Ministry of Railways has not done enough in supervising the work and has not yet met the objective requirements. I hope everyone will thoroughly examine and study this issue during this meeting.

Regarding future tasks:

(1) Complete the emergency repairs on the central section of the Longhai Railway before November 7th, so that the Longhai Railway, from Haizhou in the east to Baoji in the west, will be fully open to traffic, connecting the Northwest, North China, Central China, and Northeast, and supporting the liberation war in the Northwest.

(2) The Baoshi section of the Beijing-Hankou Railway must be completed before November 7th. The 2,330-kilometer Shian section must overcome all difficulties and complete the task of direct Beijing-Hankou traffic before the end of December. Therefore, after the Railway Corps finishes repairing the Luoyang-Tongguan section, a detachment should be transferred to the Shian section to strengthen the emergency repair efforts.

(3) The Tongpu Railway from Linfen to Fenglingdu and from Taiyuan to Anxiang is also required to be completed by the end of December. In addition to collecting materials locally, the light rails replaced by the new Soviet rails can be adjusted. Regarding the conversion to wide gauge, there are still many difficulties, which will be discussed in two or three years.

(4) The 200-kilometer Zhangshu-Pingxiang section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway must be opened to traffic by December 15th, at the latest by December 30th. The Yaojiazhou-Liling section must be completed by November 30th.

(5) Yuehan Railway: Now that Guangzhou has been liberated, the bridges north of Zhuzhou to Wuchang have been severely damaged, and materials and funds are also very difficult. We must strive to open the Beijing-Guangzhou line to traffic by the end of December to facilitate the exchange of materials between the north and the south, without fear of enemy blockades. This task is significant and glorious.

(6) Xiang-Gui-Qian Railway: The situation from Guangxi to Guizhou will depend on the progress of the People's Liberation Army. Please discuss this at this meeting.

Regarding next year's tasks and the five-year plan, please study and formulate them carefully based on the existing strength:

(1) Complete the Tongtang Line—the direct line from Datong to Tanggu.

(2) Add double tracks to sections of the Sino-Chang Railway, Shenshan (Customs) Railway, and Beijing-Shanhaiguan Railway—to strengthen transportation capacity.

(3) Restore the original routes—(1) Jinzhou to Chengde to Gubeikou—to increase the volume of transportation between North China and Northeast China. (2) Baijin Line and others.

(4) Eliminate slow speeds: In the Northeast, all slow speeds must be eliminated. In North China, except for the Yellow River Bridge, at least 90% must be achieved.

(5) We must establish a permanent special committee to make repair plans for bridges and supervise their repair. Chinese and Soviet experts should participate in researching and formulating unified standards. Preparations should be made as early as possible for the new construction projects of the Yangtze River and Yellow River Fenglingdu Bridges.

(6) The Baotou-Ningxia and Tianshui-Lanzhou lines should strive to be completed next year, at least the Tianshui-Lanzhou line should be completed. Please discuss whether this can be done.

The road maintenance plan and responsibility system are the central issues of this meeting. The main thing is to absorb the experience of the Soviet Union and the experience of the Northeast. The strengthening work of the lines must be completed before the ice and snow season.

Regarding major track repairs: The Jinan Bureau is better, the Tianjin Bureau is second, and the Zhengzhou Bureau is poorer. It is necessary to strengthen efforts, and I hope you will not relax. If we cannot summarize the new road maintenance experience well this year, it will affect the completion of the transportation tasks next year, which is absolutely not allowed. Next year, we plan to promote the road maintenance responsibility system well across the country. If we do not prepare well, we will not be able to complete the task well. At this meeting, please ask Soviet experts to make a special report and lead everyone to demonstrate a section of road, so that everyone can easily understand and change the view of neglecting road maintenance.

This time, we want to promote the spirit of the Qinhuangdao station combining family members and the masses for road maintenance to the whole country. The Tianjin Bureau has also mobilized more than 40,000 people to reinforce more than 300 kilometers of roads. The voluntary labor in the Northeast every Saturday is very good. The lines in the Northeast are much better than those in the North, so the Jinan, Zhengzhou, and Tianjin Bureaus have sent more than 200 cadres to the Northeast to visit and learn. I hope that railway employees across the country will participate in road maintenance work for two hours a week to complete the road maintenance tasks in the shortest possible time and to implement the concept that "the railway belongs to the people." Based on the experience of this year's major line repairs, we should prepare for next year's plan and strengthen the cultural and ideological study of railway engineering workers. I hope that everyone will seriously discuss and obtain certain results at this meeting, formulate realistic plans, and hope that everyone will bring them back to convey and implement them to meet the more arduous and glorious tasks of emergency repairs, new construction, and permanent restoration.

　　全国铁路工务会议上
  　滕代远部长讲话全文
    【新华社北京十八日电】铁道部滕代远部长十七日在全国铁路工务会议上的讲话，全文如下：
    同志们：由本年四月第二次工务工程会议到现在六个月了，在这个时期，同志们做了许多工作，这六个月中全国也有很大的变化，最明显的是人民政协的召开。在这个大会上讨论通过了人民政协组织法、中央人民政府组织法、及共同纲领，也就是通过了中华人民共和国的大宪章。这个会上产生了中央人民政府，毛主席向全国及全世界人民公告中华人民共和国成立，这个公告发出后，很快的得到社会主义国家苏联的承认，并立即派罗申为大使，四天之内各新民主主义国家相继的承认，这是中国历史上空前未有的一件大事，在这时期中，我们近五十万的铁路职工，接受毛主席给我们的任务：“解放军打到哪里，我们的铁路修到哪里。”保证支援前线，向前进军，保证老解放区支援新解放区，保证农村与城市物资的交流，在解放军胜利进军与沿线党政军民的帮助下，日夜不停的参加这项大的修复建设工作。至九月底止，修复了五千四百四十六公里线路，保证了大军的前进。在工作中还存在着许多错误和缺点，我们要及时改正。这次会要总结本年四月至现在工务工程的工作，要讨论养路负责制，及如何采取苏联新的养路经验，在东北我们已经采用了并收到很好的效果。本年来人民铁道能修复得这样快，我们首先要指出，这是由于苏联各方面的帮助。苏联专家们把他们的经验学术很耐心的告诉我们，苏联给我们五百公里的新轨及配件，并派来在世界第二次大战中抢修铁路最有经验的专家到新中国来。他们随革命形势的进展，由关外到关内，不怕辛苦，不怕艰难与危险来帮助我们，以国际主义精神无条件的帮助我们。这是我们应向苏联政府和苏联各位专家致谢的。
    这次会议要决定本年十一月与十二月及一九五○年工务工程的工作计划，并希望大家很好的讨论，完成这个计划。
    铁道部是新成立的，在工作中还未能很好的发挥他的作用及力量，我们的运用车三万○三百辆，非运用车九千六百辆，我们要设法使死车复活。现在装车每天是七千二百四十辆，每天输出二十二万七千二百吨，在海路被封锁的情况下，我们修通了停止十二年的京沪直达通车，输出到江南有八十一万多吨煤、粮，对南京上海解放后物价的平稳是起了一定的作用的。现在运输上的周转率：东北是四天，北方是四天，南方是三天半。我们要提高速度，消灭徐行，把周转率降低，首先就必需要把路养好。
    明年计划装车九千四百辆到一万辆，运用车三万九千五百辆，为完成这个要求，养路与修复是最要紧的，所以工务局先后派出十个小组到各局去了解情况。吕部长与工务局线路处长曾到上海、南京、武汉、青岛等地视察，工务局副局长黎亮随我到东北去视察，铁道兵团工程部副部长李泮明到淮河及潼关洛阳段督修。苏联专家于到京后，即派十七位同志与李泮明、黎亮到洛潼段与粤汉视察，并在现场督修。十月五日，苏联专家与中国专家又到北方各局了解线路情况，看到了缺点也看到了进步情况。铁道部对督促工作作的还很不够，仍未能满足客观的要求，希望这次会中好好检讨与研究这个问题。
    关于今后的任务
    （１）十一月七日前完成陇海中段的抢修工作，使陇海东起海州、西至宝鸡，全线通车，以沟通西北，华北，华中，东北及支援西北的解放战争。
    （２）京汉线，保石段要于十一月七日前完成，石安段二三三○公里无论如何要克服任何困难要在十二月底前完成京汉直达通车的任务。因此铁道兵团在洛潼段修完后，应调一个支队到石安段增强抢修力量。
    （３）同蒲线临汾到风陵渡、太原到安襄，也要求在十二月底完成。除就地征集材料外，苏联新轨换下的轻轨，可以调剂。关于改为宽轨，现在还存在着很多困难，二三年后再说。
    （４）浙赣线漳树到萍乡一段二百公里，要在十二月十五日通车，最迟十二月三十日完成。姚家洲到醴陵十一月三十日完成。
    （５）粤汉线现在广州已解放了，株州以北到武昌桥梁破坏的很严重，材料经费也很困难，我们要争取于十二月底京粤通车，使南北物资交流，不怕敌人的封锁，这任务是重大的，也是光荣的。
    （６）湘桂黔路：经广西到贵州，要看解放军进军情形而定，这次会上请大家讨论。
    关于明年的任务及五年计划，请大家根据现有力量好好研究制定之：
    （一）完成同塘线——大同到塘沽的直达线。
    （二）中长路、沈山（海关）路及京山路增设区间复轨——以加强运输力量。
    （三）恢复原有路线——（１）锦州到承德到古北口——增加华北东北的运输量。（２）白晋线及其他等。
    （四）消灭徐行：在东北要全部消灭，华北除黄河大桥外，最低要做到百分之九十以上。
    （五）我们要成立永久的专门委员会，做对桥梁的修复计划及督修工作，由中苏专家参加研究出统一的标准。关于长江及黄河风陵渡大桥的新建工程，应要求早做准备。
    （六）包（头）宁（夏）及天（水）兰（州）线，要争取在明年完成，最少天兰线要完成。能不能办到，请大家来讨论。
    养路计划及负责制，是这次会议的中心问题，主要的要吸收苏联的经验及东北的经验，要求冰雪季前完成线路加强工作。
    关于线路大修：济南局较好，天津局次之，郑州局较差。需要加强力量，希望不要放松时间。我们今年如不能很好的总结新养路经验，明年就会影响运输任务不能完成，那是决不允许的。明年计划把养路负责制很好的推行全国，如不能好好的准备，是不能很好的完成任务的。这次会议中请苏联专家作专题的报告，并领导大家做一段路作示范，以便大家易于领会，务必改变轻视养路的观点。
    这次要提出秦皇岛站结合家属及民众养路的精神，我们要推广到全国。天津局也发动了四万多人补强了三百多公里路。东北每星期六的义务劳动很好，东北线路比北方好的多，所以济南、郑州、天津各局派了二百多干部到东北去参观见习。我希望全国铁路员工每周有二小时参加养路工作，于最短时期完成养路任务，要把“铁路是人民的”观念贯彻下去，我们以今年线路大补修的经验为基础，以准备明年的计划，并需加强工务工程工作者文化思想上的学习，这次会议希望大家认真的讨论求得一定的结果，制出切合实际的计划，并希望大家带回去传达贯澈执行，以迎接更艰巨的光荣的抢修，新建，永久复旧的任务。
