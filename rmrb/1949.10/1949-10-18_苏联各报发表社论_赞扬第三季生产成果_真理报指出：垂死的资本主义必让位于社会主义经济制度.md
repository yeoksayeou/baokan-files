Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 17th: According to TASS, Moscow, 15th: Editorials in *Pravda*, *Trud*, *Moskovsky Bolshevik*, and other newspapers unanimously discussed the results of the execution of the plan to restore and develop the Soviet national economy in the third quarter of this year. The *Pravda* editorial wrote: These achievements will be welcomed by every Soviet person with patriotic pride. These achievements vividly and convincingly demonstrate that our national economy is steadily advancing along a powerful and vigorous road. *Pravda* pointed out: In our socialist industry, the quantity of production is steadily increasing month by month and quarter by quarter, while the quality of production has also been significantly improved. New technologies are constantly being adopted in industry. The variety of industrial products has increased, the quality has improved, and costs have been reduced. The number of employees engaged in national economic work is gradually increasing, while labor productivity is also improving. All this means that our industrial work is gradually becoming more perfect, industrial organization is gradually being modernized, and the cultural and technical level of the working class is gradually improving. *Pravda* further pointed out: The report of the Central Bureau of Statistics speaks of a new and powerful upsurge in our agriculture. The newspaper emphasized that the achievements of our socialist economy are truly remarkable and significant. The economic situation in capitalist countries, which are sinking deeper and deeper into a new economic crisis, presents an absolute contrast. The American bourgeois newspapers are filled with panic and fear about the new economic crisis. The government's "reassuring" statements cannot comfort anyone and have become a source of embarrassing irony, even for bourgeois economists. Capitalism is doomed to die and must give way to a socialist economic system that knows no contradiction between productive forces and relations of production, and has no crises, unemployment, or exploitation of man by man. This is the immutable law of social development.

　　苏联各报发表社论
  　赞扬第三季生产成果
    真理报指出：垂死的资本主义必让位于社会主义经济制度
    【新华社北京十七日电】据塔斯社莫斯科十五日讯：真理报、劳动报、莫斯科布尔什维克报及其他报纸的社论，一致论述恢复与发展苏联国民经济计划本年第三季执行的结果。真理报社论写道：这些成就将得到每一个怀着爱国自豪感的苏维埃人民的欢迎。这些成就生动而令人信服地说明：我国国民经济正在坚定地沿着强有力的高涨的道路迈进。真理报指出：在我们的社会主义工业中，生产数量一月比一月、一季比一季稳步地增加着，同时生产的质量也有了重大的改进。工业中正在不断地采用新的技术。工业产品的种类增加了，质量改进了，且成本也减低了。从事国民经济工作的职工数目在逐步增加，同时劳动生产率也在提高。这一切都意味着，我们的工业工作正在逐步臻于完善，工业组织正在逐步现代化，工人阶级的文化与技术水平正在逐步提高。真理报进一步指出：中央统计局的报告讲到我们农业新的强有力的高涨。该报强调称：我们的社会主义经济的成就是真正显赫而意义重大的。正在日益深重地陷入新的经济危机的资本主义各国的经济所呈现的景象，则绝对相反。美国资产阶级报纸充满着对新经济危机的惊慌与恐惧。政府“安定人心”的声明绝不能够安慰任何人，反而成了难堪讽刺的来源，甚至对于资产阶级经济学家也一样。资本主义的命运是注定了要死亡的，且必须让位给不知道生产力与生产关系的矛盾，没有危机、失业与人剥削人的社会主义经济制度。这是社会发展的不可改变的法则。
