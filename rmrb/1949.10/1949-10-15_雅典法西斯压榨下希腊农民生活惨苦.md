　　Xinhua News Agency dispatch from TASS: A TASS report on the tragic situation of Greek peasants says: According to news published in Greek newspapers, the Athens military authorities have driven a large number of peasants from villages near the liberated areas, leaving them without clothing, food, or means of making a living. The "assistance" the Athens government gives them is one thousand drachmas (Greek currency) per person, enough to buy only two boxes of matches. After the peasants in the Drama region were driven away, they returned to farm but had no farm tools or livestock, not even water wells. The Athens government is "restoring" houses in this region at a laughable speed. At this rate, it is estimated that the restoration of houses will take one hundred and fifty-four years. The anger of the peasants is growing universally, because the situation is equally bad for peasants who have not been affected by the war. The government only purchases a very small amount of grain at fixed prices, and peasants are forced to sell grain to speculators at low prices, with income not even covering costs. Farmers on the island of Crete are trapped by endless donations and taxes, preferring to let olives rot rather than make oil. Crete is rich in almonds, but Greece has to import almonds from Italy; Crete's sweet potatoes cannot be sold, but the government imports sweet potatoes from the United States. The new export tax implemented after the devaluation of the drachma has closed the foreign markets for Greek agricultural products.

　　雅典法西斯压榨下希腊农民生活惨苦
    【本报讯】据新华社电：塔斯社报道希腊农民的悲惨境遇说：据希腊报纸刊载消息：雅典军事当局从接近解放区的农村中逐出大量农民，使他们无衣无食无法谋生，雅典政府给他们的“援助”是每人一千德拉赤马（希币），只够买两盒火柴。德拉马地区的农民被驱后，还乡种田又没有农具牲畜，甚至没有水井。雅典政府以可笑的速度在这地区“恢复”房舍，按这种速度估计，房舍的恢复需时一百五十四年。农民的愤怒普遍增长，因为未受战争影响的农民情形也同样地坏。政府只以固定价格收购极少的谷物，农民被迫以低价出售谷物给投机商人，收入抵不上成本。克里特岛的农民困于无穷的捐税，宁让橄榄腐烂也不愿制油。克里特岛盛产杏仁，但希腊要从意大利输入杏仁；克里特岛的番薯卖不出去，政府却从美国输入番薯。继德拉赤马贬值后实行的新出口税，已关闭了希腊农产品的国外市场。
