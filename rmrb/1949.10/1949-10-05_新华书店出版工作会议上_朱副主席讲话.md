Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 4th: The full text of Vice Chairman Zhu De's speech at the National Xinhua Bookstore Publishing Work Conference on the 3rd is as follows:

Holding the National Xinhua Bookstore Publishing Work Conference at the time of the founding of the People's Republic of China is very meaningful. Chairman Mao said in his opening speech at the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: "With the advent of the high tide of economic construction, a high tide of cultural construction will inevitably appear." We are certainly not completely unprepared for this inevitable high tide of cultural construction, but we must also admit that our preparations are still not sufficient. To overcome the culturally backward phenomenon of our nation, so that we can "appear in the world as a nation with a high degree of culture," this matter is no easier than defeating a Chiang Kai-shek aided by American imperialism. In order to thoroughly win the battle on the cultural front, we must better organize the various troops on our cultural front and make them work more effectively. Publishing workers are undoubtedly an indispensable and important force on the cultural front. Your convening of this meeting shows that you have the confidence and courage to meet the high tide of cultural construction.

Revolutionary publishing workers have done a lot of work in the past and have had many achievements. The role they have played in the entire revolutionary cause should not be underestimated. But of course you already understand that being satisfied with existing achievements will prevent us from undertaking new tasks. In the past, publishing work served revolutionary military affairs and the people's political struggle. Now that the national production and construction undertaking has begun, publishing work must serve the production and construction undertaking even more. This is a new task for our publishing workers. The fact that the revolution has triumphed throughout the country and the fact that the high tide of cultural construction is about to arrive will constantly raise many new and major tasks for our publishing workers, requiring everyone to learn from scratch. If a person cannot constantly improve himself ideologically and cannot pursue progress in his work every day, he will certainly not be able to do any work well, and of course he will not be able to do publishing work well. Revolutionary publishing workers must always remember that they are responsible to the people and are political workers and propagandists among the people. Therefore, they must first learn from the masses of the people. Only those who can seriously learn from the people can do a good job of educating the people. Revolutionary publishing workers must elevate daily work to a political level, improve their work meticulously, and improve work efficiency. Therefore, they must earnestly study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, carefully study policies in various fields, and combine them with their own work.

The just-concluded CPPCC meeting and the various documents it produced all demonstrate the revolutionary unity of the Chinese people. This unity was achieved under the leadership of Mao Zedong Thought. Such unity is possible and necessary in all national construction undertakings, and publishing work is no exception. The CPPCC program mentioned publishing when it said, "Develop the people's publishing undertaking, and pay attention to publishing popular books and newspapers that are beneficial to the people." Transforming this sentence into reality is an arduous task. We are a large country with a population of 475 million, and our publishing undertaking is still very immature compared to advanced countries. Therefore, we must unite all those who are willing and able to serve the people's publishing undertaking to work together. We must unite private publishing undertakings and joint public-private publishing undertakings around public publishing undertakings and jointly engage in the cultural construction of New China. If we do not do this, we will not be able to do things well.

As long as, on the one hand, you can study hard and improve your thinking and ability, and on the other hand, do a good job of unity work, I believe that you will definitely be able to form a huge and powerful force to vigorously develop the New Democratic publishing undertaking and meet the needs of the people. You must know that at the time when you are holding this meeting, millions of people who are eager for books and newspapers and eager for culture are enthusiastically looking forward to you.

### 新华书店出版工作会议上　 朱副主席讲话

　　新华书店出版工作会议上
  　朱副主席讲话
    【新华社北京四日电】朱德副主席三日在全国新华书店出版工作会议的讲话全文如下：
    正在中华人民共和国成立的时候，举行全国新华书店出版工作会议，是很有意义的。毛主席在中国人民政治协商会议的开幕词中说：“随着经济建设的高潮的到来，不可避免地将要出现一个文化建设的高潮。”对于这个必将到来的文化建设的高潮，我们固然并不是毫无准备，但也必须承认，至今我们准备的还不够充分。要克服我们的民族在文化上落后的现象，使我们能够“以一个具有高度的文化的民族出现于世界”。这件事并不比打败一个在美国帝国主义援助下的蒋介石更容易一些。为了在文化战线上也能够彻底打胜仗，那就必须使我们在文化战线上的各个部队更好地组织起来，更有效地工作起来。出版工作者，无疑问的是文化战线上不可缺少的重要部队之一。你们开这个会议，就表明你们是有信心和勇气来迎接文化建设的高潮的。
    革命的出版工作者，在过去做过许多工作，有过许多成绩，在整个革命事业中所起的作用是不应低估的。但你们当然已经懂得，满足于已有的成就，是会妨碍我们去担负新的任务的。过去，出版工作是为革命军事服务，为人民的政治斗争事业服务，现在，全国的生产建设事业开始了，出版工作就更要为生产建设事业而服务。这对于我们的出版工作者就是一项新的任务。革命在全国范围内胜利的事实，文化建设的高潮即将到来的事实，在我们的出版工作者面前将不断提出许多新的重大任务，要求大家从头学习。一个人，如果不能在思想上不断提高自己，不能在业务上每天追求进步，他一定是做不好任何工作的，当然也做不好出版工作。革命的出版工作者必须时时刻刻记得他是对人民负责的，是在人民中的政治工作者、宣传工作者，因此他就首先要向人民大众学习，能够认真向人民学习的人才能够做好教育人民的工作。革命的出版工作者一定要把日常业务提到政治的高度，精益求精地改进业务，提高工作的效率，因此他一定要认真学习马列主义和毛泽东思想，认真研究各方面的政策，拿来和自己的业务结合起来。
    刚闭幕的人民政协的会议和它所产生的各种文件，都表现着中国人民的革命大团结，这种团结是在毛主席思想的领导下实现的。在所有的一切国家建设事业中都可能也必须实现这样的团结，出版工作也是同样。人民政协纲领中提到出版事业时说：“发展人民的出版事业，并注重出版有益于人民的通俗书报”，要把这一句话转变成事实是艰巨的工作。我们是一个四万万七千五百万人口的大国家，而我们的出版事业比起先进的国家来，还是很幼稚的。因此，我们就一定要团结一切愿意和可能为人民的出版事业服务的人，来共同工作，就一定要把私营出版事业和公私合营的出版事业都团结在公营出版事业的周围而共同从事新中国的文化建设，不这样做，我们就不能把事情办好。
    只要一方面，你们能认真学习，提高自己的思想和能力，一方面好好做团结工作，我相信，你们一定能组成一支庞大的强有力的部队，把新民主主义的出版事业蓬蓬勃勃地发展起来，而满足人民的需求。要知道，在你们举行这个会议时，千百万渴望着书报、渴望着文化的群众是在热情地企待着你们的。（附图片）
