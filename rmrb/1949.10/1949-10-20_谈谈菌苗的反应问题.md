　　Talking About Vaccine Reactions
　　Liu Junxiang

Regarding the common vaccines currently available, they are still mostly heterologous proteins without much alteration in chemical properties. It is unavoidable and not surprising that they cause some degree of local or systemic reactions when injected into the human body. However, the purpose of vaccine injection is to prevent disease and reduce human suffering. Yet, causing pain during or shortly after the injection is difficult for people without medical knowledge, or even those with some knowledge but lacking a preventive mindset, to understand. Therefore, reactions often become an obstacle to promoting preventive vaccinations, especially when the reactions are severe, causing many inconveniences. The issue of vaccine reactions has been an unresolved problem for both manufacturers of biological products and those involved in disease prevention for many years. I would like to present my personal views on this issue for your reference, hoping that experts and scholars will offer valuable opinions to jointly solve this problem.

I. Manufacturing Aspects

　　1. Efficacy and Reactions: Although the efficacy of a vaccine is not necessarily directly proportional to the intensity of the reaction, there is still a significant correlation. The strains used to make vaccines must have strong virulence (not a universal rule; for example, avirulent strains are used for plague vaccines), and strains with strong virulence usually cause stronger reactions. High concentrations of vaccines cause stronger reactions, but vaccines must have a certain concentration to be effective. After culturing the bacteria, wash them with physiological saline once or twice before making the vaccine to reduce reactions. However, washed vaccines are less effective because some of the soluble antigens are washed away. In some manufacturing locations in Europe and America, to minimize reactions, they sacrifice some efficacy and use the washing method, but they all admit that this method is not ideal. Therefore, achieving high vaccine efficacy while minimizing reactions is not a simple problem.

In the past, the Tiantan Epidemic Prevention Center advocated prioritizing efficacy over minimizing reactions. Therefore, the virulence of the strains should be as strong as possible, and the concentration should be high rather than diluted. They also did not advocate using washed vaccines. This year, the cholera-typhoid-paratyphoid mixed vaccine produced by the Epidemic Prevention Center caused a larger reaction after injection. The Tianjin Municipal Health Bureau and the Beijing First Health Clinic raised this issue, asking for the reason and stating that the masses were reluctant to receive injections due to fear of excessive reactions. The Epidemic Prevention Center carefully studied this issue and found that the turbidity standard tube (manufactured by British Buanough Willcome) used to determine the concentration was inaccurate, resulting in an excessively high concentration of the vaccine. They are now replacing it with a new standard and researching new methods for determining concentration to ensure that this problem does not occur again in the future. At the same time, everyone agreed that while vaccine efficacy is important, it is wrong to focus solely on efficacy and ignore reactions. If the masses refuse to receive injections due to large vaccine reactions, then even good efficacy is useless. To make vaccines widely available, efforts should be made to reduce vaccine reactions. It is necessary to reconsider the past views on reactions and efficacy. Currently, the vaccine laboratory of the Epidemic Prevention Center has made the issue of vaccine reactions a central task and is intensifying research, which may be resolved in the short term. They also plan to hold a symposium for bacterial immunologists and biological product specialists to discuss this issue.

　　2. Contamination with Bacteria: In theory, a vaccine should only contain the bacteria it is supposed to contain (e.g., typhoid vaccine should only contain typhoid bacilli, and typhoid-cholera vaccine should only contain typhoid bacilli and cholera vibrio). There should be no other bacteria. However, in practice, it is difficult to avoid the invasion of miscellaneous bacteria from the air during operation; special care and caution are required. Although the presence of miscellaneous bacteria in the product does not necessarily increase the reaction, it cannot be said that it is impossible (especially Staphylococcus aureus, etc.). Maintaining the purity of the vaccine is important to minimize vaccine reactions. The Tiantan Epidemic Prevention Center has paid attention to this point in improving vaccine quality, taking strict measures to ensure that there are no miscellaneous bacteria in the vaccine.

II. Usage Aspects

No matter how well a vaccine is made, it cannot guarantee safety if used improperly. Attention must be paid to disinfection when injecting vaccines, and vaccines must be stored well to avoid contamination. These are small matters and easy to say, but they are often overlooked. On the morning of September 20th this year, a doctor saw an epidemic prevention team at the Beijing East Railway Station injecting cholera vaccine for travelers. The rubber stopper of one of the three bottles of vaccine on the table was turned upwards (the rubber stopper should not be opened; the top of the stopper should be disinfected with alcohol, and the needle of the disinfected syringe should be inserted to draw out the vaccine to prevent bacteria in the air from entering the bottle). At that time, the doctor raised an opinion to the epidemic prevention team, but the people in the epidemic prevention team replied: "This was just opened to pour the vaccine. We also know that it should be drawn out with a needle, but sometimes there are too many people, and it is too slow to draw with a needle." The method of opening the bottle stopper and pouring is quite common and is not limited to this one epidemic prevention team, indicating that many people are not careful enough about the usage method. Although it may not necessarily cause problems, it is easy to cause problems, and it may be quite serious. This point must be noted.

An even more serious situation occurred in a clothing factory in this city. The factory clinic held preventive vaccination, using vaccines from the Tiantan Epidemic Prevention Center. A total of three injections were given. The first two times, there were no problems. After the third injection, many people developed severe reactions, local suppuration, and other toxic symptoms. The investigation revealed that the clinic had poured the remaining vaccine into an undisinfected container, and the vaccine was contaminated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and a spore-forming bacillus (as proven by culture). The third injection was precisely the remaining vaccine, which caused very serious consequences.

The epidemic prevention team of the North China Agricultural Research Institute went to prevent cattle plague and incidentally injected vaccines for the people. Because the team's injection technique was better and caused less pain, it was very popular among the people, and many voluntarily requested injections. A village also requested injections and claimed to have its own vaccine, but after questioning, it was learned that the vaccine was opened last year and not used up, and only half of the bottle was left. Fortunately, it was not used, otherwise, problems were very likely to occur.

Drinking alcohol and strenuous exercise are prohibited after vaccine injection. However, some people do not pay attention to this, and sometimes they are injected during strenuous labor, and they do not stop working after injection, which increases the reaction, especially local redness and swelling.

From these examples, it can be seen that there are still many medical workers who do not pay enough attention to the method of using vaccines, lack sterile operation training, or are not serious enough. This is worthy of our attention.

III. Publicity and Education Aspects

As mentioned earlier, it is not surprising that injecting vaccines causes more or less local or systemic reactions. It is not easy, at least not at present, to inject vaccines without even a little redness and pain. A factory in this city held preventive vaccination for more than 100 workers. They did not rest after the injection, and some of them developed very serious reactions in the evening, which resulted in a day of work stoppage the next day. The investigation found that the more severe reactions included large local pain and redness, which disappeared after four or five days (some even had pain on half of their body, and the systemic reaction was also greater), and three of them had a body temperature as high as 38 degrees Celsius. Moderate reactions occurred in 30%, with local redness and swelling disappearing after two or three days, without significant systemic reactions. Some felt unwell all over their bodies, and no one had a fever. The rest had only mild reactions, with slight local redness and swelling, which disappeared quickly without systemic reactions. Reactions like this seem very ordinary to us, but the factory viewed it as very serious, calling doctors in the middle of the night and even stopping work for a day the next day. Similar things are often heard. Treating reactions so seriously and exaggerating the adverse effects can easily become an obstacle in disease prevention work if not corrected in time. It is essential for epidemic prevention workers to patiently conduct publicity, persuasion, and education to the masses.

In summary, we believe that solving the problem of vaccine reactions cannot be achieved by one-sided efforts. In terms of manufacturing, efforts must be made to reduce vaccine reactions. In terms of usage, strict adherence to the correct usage is required. Epidemic prevention workers must also patiently conduct publicity and education to the masses. None of the three can succeed without the other.

　　谈谈菌苗的反应问题
    刘隽湘
    以现在一般的菌苗来讲都还是在化学性质上没有经过多少改变的异性蛋白，注入人体引起或多或少的局部或全身反应还是不可免的，也是不足为奇的。可是注射菌苗的目的本来是防病，减少人的痛苦，却在注射时或注射后的短时期内引起痛苦，这对于没有医学常识的人，甚至有点知识但缺乏预防观点的人，都是不易想通的。因此反应常常变成推行防疫注射的阻碍，尤其是反应大了更会引起许多不便。菌苗的反应多年来无论对制造生物制品的或防疫工作者一直是一个没有解决的问题，我现在把个人对这问题的看法提出来供大家参考，希望各专家学者多提些宝贵意见来共同解决这个问题。
    一、制造方面
    １．效力与反应：虽然菌苗的效力不一定与反应强度成正比，但是却有很多关连。作菌苗的菌种必须毒力强（非一概而论，如鼠疫菌苗有用无毒菌种的），而毒力强的菌普通引起的反应也较强；菌苗的浓度高引起的反应便强，可是要菌苗有效必须够一定的浓度。培养好的菌采下来先用生理盐水洗涤一二次，再作成菌苗，反应可以减少。可是洗过的菌苗，因为一部分可溶的抗原被洗去，效力也较差。在欧美有些制造地方，为了把反应减到最低限度，不惜牺牲一些效力而采用洗涤法，可是他们都承认这法子不好。所以要菌苗的效力大又要反应小并不是一个简单的问题。
    过去就天坛防疫处来讲，在原则上是主张宁愿反应大些也不牺牲效力的。所以对于菌种毒力是要愈强愈好，对于浓度则宁愿太浓不要太淡，更不主张用洗过的菌苗。今年防疫处制造的霍乱伤寒副伤寒混合菌苗注射了反应较大，已经由天津市卫生局及北京第一卫生事务所提出、询问原因，并说群众因为怕反应多不愿注射；防疫处已将这一问题仔细的研究，结果发现定浓度所用的标准比浊管（英国Ｂｕａｎｏｕｇｈ　Ｗｉｌｌｃｏｍｅ制）已不准确，因而所制菌苗浓度过高，现在正在另换新标准，并在研究新的定浓度办法以保证以后不致再发生问题。同时大家讨论认为菌苗的效力固然要紧，但是只顾了效力而忽视反应也是不对的，如果群众因为菌苗反应大而不肯接受注射，则效力虽好也是无用的。为了能使菌苗普及推广，应当尽力减少菌苗的反应，过去对于反应与效力的看法，就有重新考虑的必要。现在防疫处菌苗室已把菌苗的反应问题当作一个中心工作在加紧研究，短期内可能获得解决，同时打算召开一个细菌免疫学家和生物制品专门人材的座谈会，来商谈这一问题。
    ２、杂菌问题：在理论上讲来，一种菌苗应当只含菌苗内所应有的细菌（如伤寒菌苗只含伤寒杆菌，伤寒霍乱菌苗只含伤寒杆菌与霍乱弧菌），不应当有一个其他的细菌。可是实际上在操作中，空气中的杂菌侵入制品是很难避免的；非得特别小心谨慎不可。制品里混有杂菌虽不一定增加反应，但也不能说决不可能增加反应（尤其是葡萄状球菌等）。要把菌苗的反应减至最低度，保持菌苗的纯洁是重要的。天坛防疫处在改进菌苗品质方面，已经注意到这一点，采取严密的办法，要保证菌苗内没有杂菌。
    二、使用方面
    不管菌苗作得如何好，如果使用的方法不对，便不能保证安全。注射菌苗时必须注意消毒，菌苗必须保存好不要染污，事情虽小，说起来也很容易，但是却常被人忽略。今年九月二十日早晨，一位医生在北京东站看见某防疫队在那里替旅客注射霍乱菌苗，桌上三瓶菌苗中一瓶的橡皮塞子已经翻朝上面（橡皮塞子不应当打开，应当用酒精将塞子顶上消毒，把消毒注射器的针头刺入，将菌苗吸出，以免空气中细菌侵入瓶内）。当时便向该防疫队人提出意见，该防疫队的人却回答说：“这是刚刚倒菌苗打开的，我们也知道该吸出来，但有时人太多，用针吸太慢，来不及。”打开瓶塞子倒这个办法相当普遍，并不只这一个防疫队犯这个错误，可见很多人对于使用方法不够小心，固然不一定会出毛病，可是要出毛病是很容易的，也可能是相当严重的，这点必须注意。
    比这更严重的情况发生在本市某被服厂。该厂医务室举行防疫注射，用的是天坛防疫处的菌苗，一共注射三次。头二次没发生任何问题，第三次注射后有好多人发生严重的反应，局部化脓等中毒现象。调查结果原来该医务室曾把用剩的菌苗倒入不消毒的容器内，菌苗被绿脓杆菌及一种芽胞杆菌所污染（经培养证明），而第三次注射的正是这剩下来的菌苗，因而引起了很严重的后果。
    华北农业研究所的防疫队去防治牛疫顺便为老百姓注射菌苗，因为该队注射的手术较好，引起的痛苦少，很受老百姓的欢迎，有很多自动要求注射的。有一个村子也要求注射，并谓自备有菌苗，但经过询问才知道那菌苗是去年开过未用完的，瓶内只有一半了，幸亏没有用，否则出毛病是很可能的。
    注射菌苗后忌饮酒及剧烈运动。可是有的人却不注意这点，有时甚至在剧烈的劳动中注射，注射后也未停止劳动，因而增加了反应，尤其是局部的红肿。
    由这几个例子，可以看出还有不少医务工作者对于菌苗的使用法不够注意，缺乏无菌操作的训练，或者不够认真，这是值得我们注意的。
    三、宣传教育方面
    前面已经说过注射菌苗引起或多或少局部或全身的反应是不足为奇的，要想注射了菌苗连一点红肿和痛苦也没有至少到目前为止还不易作到，本市某工厂举行防疫注射，有一百多工人，注射后也未休息，晚上有的发生了很严重的反应，次日因而停工了一天。经过调查，发现反应较严重的有局部疼痛红肿很大，四五天后才消失（有的连带身体的半边都痛，全身反应也较大），其中三人体温高至摄氏三十八度。反应中等程度的有３０％，局部红肿二三天消失，无显著的全身反应，有的觉得周身不适，没有人发烧。其余的只有轻微的反应，局部稍有红肿，很快便消失了，没有全身反应。象这样的反应在我们看起来似乎是很平常的，可是该厂都把它看得很严重，半夜里打电话找医生甚至次日停工一天。类似这样的事，常常听说到，如此把反应看得过分严重，扩大不良影响，如不及时纠正，很容易变成防疫工作中的阻碍。防疫工作者耐心地向群众进行宣传说服和教育是十分必要的。
    总起来，我们认为解决菌苗的反应问题，单靠一方面的努力是不够的。在制造方面，必须尽力减少菌苗的反应；在使用方面，必须严格按照正确的用法。而防疫工作者也必须耐心的向群众进行宣传教育。三者缺一都不会成功的。
