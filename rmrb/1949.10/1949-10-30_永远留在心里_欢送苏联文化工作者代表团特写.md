　　Forever in Our Hearts
    A Special Feature on Seeing Off the Soviet Cultural Workers Delegation
    By Our Reporter Lu Hao
    The special train for seeing off the Soviet Cultural Workers Delegation had already reached its departure time. The departure bell had rung twice, the second time for a very long time; the whistle was also tooting repeatedly. But Minaev of the Red Army Choir was still being lifted high again and again by the members of our country's outgoing cultural troupe; Simonov and Guo Moruo were embracing and kissing each other warmly for a long time. The delegation's typist, Gurokina, shed tears of emotion.
    The special train had slowly started to move. But the people who were leaving were still surrounded by the crowd and had not boarded the train, while some of the well-wishers even jumped onto the train instead. The honored guests opened the train windows and reached out to shake hands tightly with everyone who passed by, the well-wishers followed the moving train, running and chasing, reaching out to the train.
    The Soviet Cultural Workers Delegation stayed in New China for thirty-four days. These days will forever remain in the hearts of the Chinese people, arousing deep memories.
    In the capital, people will remember that on October 1st, at the grand founding ceremony, they saw the honored guests of our great friendly nation for the first time. At the lecture held at Peking University, Fadeyev and Simonov were enthusiastically carried all the way to the rostrum by the students of Peking University as soon as they got off the car, red and green paper flowers were scattered all over them, and the students happily threw their hats, clothes, and even schoolbags into the sky. People still remember the two sentences that Comrade Fadeyev said: "I saw your hearts, as fiery as the sun." We will also always remember Comrades Finogenov and Smelev, who visited the peasants of Bagou Village on the night of October 25th. When they arrived at the home of the poor peasant Guan Zongyin, the whole village surrounded them. This one presented them with a bright red coxcomb, that one offered them red persimmons and white lotus roots, and someone else gave them a big pumpkin, with the words "To Soviet Friends" engraved on it. They loaded these things onto the train. Because they knew that the peasants were truly opening their hearts to receive them. When we think of Comrade Dubinina, this benevolent old woman who was a Bolshevik for thirty years and had won five medals in the war, we quickly think of the morning of October 27th, when she personally taught dozens of Chinese children at the Municipal No. 4 Middle School in the capital. Our children will grow up and proudly remember forever that Dubinina gave them their first Russian lesson.
    We know that they once happily toured the tranquil and beautiful Xuanwu Lake in Nanjing, strolled on the Changdi Bridge, and also visited the "Presidential Palace" of the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, with its dragon-carved red pillars, yellow sofas, and a copy of the Diamond Sutra casually placed on the bookshelf. The calendar on the desk was marked April 22, 1938, recording the day when the Kuomintang bandit gang fled Nanjing. We remember Varlamov said at that time: "This house is not as good as a food store in Moscow, but this calendar is worth our careful look." In this house where Chiang Kai-shek once issued his "New Year's Message," boasting that he would definitely eliminate the People's Liberation Army in six months, the great people of China and the Soviet Union jointly indulged in mocking Chiang Kai-shek, the number one bullshitter in the world.
    We will not forget that on October 19th, in Shanghai, more than 10,000 People's Liberation Army soldiers warmly welcomed the delegation. Eighteen combat heroes held bouquets of flowers in both hands and presented them to each delegate, and then hung the glorious Crossing-the-Yangtze Commemorative Medals on the delegates' chests. Wei Laiguo, a shooting hero who had killed or wounded more than 360 enemies, hung the Crossing-the-Yangtze Commemorative Medal on Simonov, who hugged him tightly and kissed him repeatedly. Simonov, who had participated in the Battle of Stalingrad as a major general brigade commander, loved combat heroes so much. On the train from Beijing to Shanghai, he had a seven-hour conversation with Yang Shiming, who had participated in the Long March and had been wounded five times. When Yang Shiming was about to leave, he asked Simonov for a commemorative medal as a souvenir. Simonov enthusiastically asked others for a Communist Youth League membership badge to give him, it was very dark at the time, he asked the translator to strike a match for him and personally put it on Yang Shiming's chest, at the same time he said excitedly: "Although we are both not very young, our feelings are still young." The selfless working spirit of the Soviet friends will never be forgotten by the people of Shanghai. Minaev of the Red Army Choir injured his wrist while dancing in Beijing, and the injury was very serious. The doctor advised him that if he performed again, his arm would be disabled. When the Red Army Choir performed for the working class of Shanghai, he unwrapped the bandage and participated in the performance as usual. The doctor repeatedly dissuaded him, and he said: "I came to China to perform, and even if my arm is disabled, I am happy that the Shanghai workers can see the Red Army dance." The Soviet performance team of the Soviet Cultural Delegation, in the thirty-four days, in addition to traveling more than 7,600 kilometers, also performed 27 times, with an audience of more than 217,000 people. In Shanghai, they often performed two shows a day, but they never said they were tired.
    The Soviet Cultural Delegation stayed in Jinan, Shandong for twenty-four hours. 50,000 people in Jinan held a grand welcoming meeting. Near the end of the meeting, all the employees of Renfeng Yarn Factory wrote a letter to the delegation, the gist of which was: We are eager for you to come, but today the venue is too large, and unfortunately we can't see you, we hope that the delegation can go around the venue after the meeting so that we can see you. Simonov happily agreed to this request. So, led by the band, the delegation walked around the 50,000 people. They were busy waving and shaking hands, passing through the rows of workers, soldiers, and students. Cheers resounded through the clouds. Everyone considered it their honor to see the Soviet delegation.
    The special train has already left the platform. The train is heading north, but the fiery hearts of the Chinese people are also heading north, thinking of our great international friends!

　　永远留在心里　
    欢送苏联文化工作者代表团特写
    本报记者  陆灏
    欢送苏联文化工作者代表团的专车已到开车的时间了。发车铃已经响了两次，第二次的铃声一直连续了很久；汽笛也在嘟嘟的鸣叫。但红军歌舞团的米那也夫，仍然被我国出国文工团的团员们一次又一次的高高的举起来；西蒙诺夫和郭沫若、久久的在热情的拥抱着、吻着。代表团的打字员古罗基娜掉下了感动的泪珠。
    专车已经徐徐开动了。但要走的人还被人群包围着没有上车，送行的人有的倒反而跳上火车去。贵宾们打开车窗伸出手来和每一个经过面前的人紧紧握手，送行的跟着已经开动的专车，跑着、追着向车上伸过手去。
    苏联文化工作者代表团，在新中国停留了三十四天的日子。这些日子，将永远留在中国人民的心里，引起深长的回忆。
    在首都，人们会记得十月一号那一天，在盛大的开国大典上，第一次见到了伟大友邦的贵宾。在北京大学举行演讲会时，法捷耶夫和西蒙诺夫刚下车，就被北大同学热情的一直抬到主席台上，红绿纸花抛撒了他们全身，同学们高兴得把帽子、衣服甚至书包抛向天空。人们至今还记得法捷耶夫同志说过这两句话：“我看见了你们的心，象太阳一样火热。”我们也会永远记得费诺格诺夫同志和史灭略夫同志，在十月二十五日夜里去访问巴沟村的农民，当走到贫农管宗胤家的时候，全村的人包围了他们。这个献给他们煊红的鸡冠花，那个捧给他们红色的柿子和白色的藕，还有人送给他们大北瓜，上面刻着“送给苏联朋友”六个字，他们把这些东西装上了火车。因为他们知道农民们是真正掏出心来接待的。我们想起杜白诺维娜同志，这位三十年的老布尔塞维克和在战争中得过五次奖章的慈爱的老人，我们就很快想到十月二十七日的上午，她在首都曾经给市立第四中学的几十个中国孩子亲自上过课，我们的孩子们将来长大了，会骄傲的永远记得是杜白诺维娜给自己上了第一课俄文。
    我们知道他们曾经欢游过南京宁静美丽的玄武湖，在长堤桥头上漫步，也去看过卖国贼蒋介石的“总统府”，雕龙红柱，黄色沙发，书架上随手摆着金刚波罗密经，案头日历上写着三十八年四月二十二日，记载着国民党匪帮逃出南京的日子。记得瓦尔拉莫夫在那时候说过这样的话：“这屋子不如莫斯科的食品店，可是这日历倒值得我们好好地看。”在这所蒋介石曾经发表过“元旦文告”，狂言六个月一定消灭人民解放军的房子里，中苏两国伟大的人民共同纵情嘲笑蒋介石这天字第一号的牛皮专家。
    不会忘记十月十九日，在上海，一万多人民解放军热情的欢迎了代表团，十八位战斗英雄双手捧着鲜花，送到每一个代表手里，又把光荣的渡江纪念章挂在代表们的胸前，曾杀伤过三百六十余名敌人的射击英雄魏来国向西蒙诺夫挂渡江纪念章后，西蒙诺夫紧紧拥抱了他，并连连与他接吻。曾经在斯大林格勒参加过战斗担任少将旅长的西蒙诺夫，他是这样热爱着战斗英雄。在从北京到上海的列车上，他和一个参加过长征受过五次伤的杨世明作了七个钟头的谈话。杨世明快走的时候，向西蒙诺夫要个纪念章作纪念，西蒙诺夫热心的向别人要了个共产主义青年团团员的证章给他，当时天很黑，他让翻译给他划根洋火，亲手给杨世明带在胸前，同时他激动的说：“虽然我们两人不太年青了，但我们的感情还是年青的。”苏联朋友忘我的工作精神，使上海人民永远不能忘怀。红军歌舞团米那也夫在北京跳舞摔伤了手腕，伤势很重，医生劝告他如再演出，手臂就要残废。当红军歌舞团向上海工人阶级演出时，他就将包扎解开照常参加演出，医师再三劝阻他，他说：“我到中国是来表演的，为了上海工人同志能够看到红军舞蹈，即使手臂残废也是快乐的。”苏联文化代表团的苏联演出队，在三十四天的时间中，除了行程七千六百余公里外，还演出二十七次，观众达二十一万七千多人。在上海，有不少日子一天演出两场，但他们始终不说疲倦。
    苏联文化代表团在山东济南停留了二十四小时。济南五万人民曾举行盛大的欢迎会。在大会快结束的时候，仁丰纱厂的全体职工向代表团写过一封信，大意是：我们渴望你们来到，但今天会场太大，可惜看不到你们，希望代表团会后能绕场一周，让我们能看到你们。西蒙诺夫愉快地允诺了这个请求。于是由乐队为前导，代表团在五万人的周围绕场行进。他们忙着挥手又忙着握手，穿过工人的、战士的、学生的行列面前。欢呼之声响彻云霄。每一个人都以看到苏联代表团，作为自己的荣耀。
    专车已经开出月台了。列车一直向北驰驶，但是，中国人民火热的心也一直向北，想望着我们伟大的国际友人！
