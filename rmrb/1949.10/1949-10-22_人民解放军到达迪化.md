　　People's Liberation Army Arrives in Dihua
    A unit of the First Field Army of the People's Liberation Army, with the consent and welcome of the Xinjiang military and political authorities, arrived in Dihua, the capital of Xinjiang Province, on the 20th. This is a major event in the history of Xinjiang and also a major event in the history of Northwest China.
    The peaceful liberation of Xinjiang and the entry of the People's Liberation Army into Xinjiang have basically ended the oppression suffered by the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang from various reactionaries for hundreds of years. For hundreds of years, especially in the last ten years or so, many vicious adventurers have successively occupied Xinjiang, turning it into a dark ethnic hell. The various ethnic groups in Xinjiang have therefore held many resistance movements, and in recent years have first achieved victory in the three districts of Yili, Tacheng, and Ashan. However, it was not until this time, under the influence of the great victories of the People's Liberation Army throughout the country and in Northwest China, that the Xinjiang military and political authorities shifted to the people's position, accepted the leadership of the Central People's Government, and welcomed the rapid entry of the People's Liberation Army into Xinjiang, that Xinjiang obtained the first step of liberation and the basis for gradual democratization. We believe that the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang will surely be able to form a close-knit family under the leadership of the Central People's Government and the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government, and establish a free and progressive life. We also believe that the original military and political personnel in Xinjiang will certainly be able to unite with the People's Liberation Army, strive for progress, transform themselves, unite the people of all ethnic groups, and work together to build a new Xinjiang.
    Xinjiang is liberated, and the Northwest is completely liberated. The progress of the People's Liberation Army on the Northwest battlefield, like its progress on other battlefields, has been much faster than people expected. The People's Liberation Army on the Northwest Front liberated Xi'an in May, smashed the joint counterattack of Hu Zongnan and Ma Bufang's troops in June, annihilated eight divisions of Hu Zongnan's Li Zhen Corps in July, liberated Lanzhou in August, annihilated the main force of Ma Bufang's troops, liberated Xining in early September, liberated western Gansu in mid-September, and liberated Ningxia in late September, annihilating Ma Hongkui's troops. Xinjiang and Suiyuan then declared peaceful liberation. This brilliant achievement is the result of the united, brave, and concerted efforts of all commanders, fighters, and staff members of the People's Liberation Army on the Northwest Front, as well as the result of the concerted assistance of the people's organizations of all ethnic groups in the Northwest to the People's Liberation Army and the People's Government in their joint struggle. The Northwest is the birthplace of the Chinese nation, and since 1935, it has been the birthplace of the forward development of the Chinese people's liberation cause. It is vast, rich in resources, and has unlimited prospects. We hereby congratulate the liberation of the entire Northwest and wish the people of the Northwest continued unity and struggle to eliminate the remnants of the Hu Zongnan bandit troops, and to develop the political, economic, and cultural construction of the Great Northwest.

　　人民解放军到达迪化
    人民解放军第一野战军一部，在新疆军政当局的同意和欢迎之下，在二十日下午到达新疆省会迪化。这是新疆历史上的一件大事，也是西北历史上的一件大事。
    新疆的和平解放和人民解放军开入新疆，基本上结束了新疆各民族人民数百年以来所受于各种反动派的压迫。数百年来，尤其是近十余年来，许多穷凶极恶的冒险家先后盘据新疆，把新疆造成了黑暗的民族地狱。新疆各民族因此举行了多次反抗，并于近年在伊犁、塔城、阿山三区首先得到了胜利。但直到这次在全国和西北人民解放军巨大胜利的影响之下，新疆军政当局转入人民立场，接受中央人民政府领导，并欢迎人民解放军迅速开入新疆，新疆才得到了第一步解放和逐步民主化的基础。我们相信，新疆各民族人民今后必能在中央人民政府和新疆省人民政府领导之下，形成亲密团结的大家庭，建立自由进步的生活。我们也相信，新疆的原有军政人员，一定能够与人民解放军团结一致，力求进步，改造自己，团结各民族人民，为共同建设新新疆而努力。
    新疆解放了，西北完全解放了。人民解放军在西北战场的进展，和在其他战场的进展一样，比人们预期的更要迅速得多。西北前线的人民解放军在五月解放西安，六月击破胡宗南马步芳两部的联合反扑，七月歼灭胡宗南部李振兵团八个师，八月解放兰州，歼灭马步芳部主力，九月初旬解放西宁，中旬解放甘西，下旬解放宁夏，歼灭马鸿逵部，新疆和绥远随即宣告和平解放。这个辉煌的成绩，是西北前线人民解放军全体指挥员战斗员工作员团结一致英勇作战的结果，也是西北各民族人民团体一致协助人民解放军和人民政府共同奋斗的结果。西北是中华民族的发祥地，是一九三五年以来中国人民解放事业向前发展的发祥地，地大物博，前途无限。我们在此庆贺全西北的解放，并祝西北人民继续团结奋斗，消灭胡宗南匪部残余，并发展大西北的政治建设、经济建设和文化建设。
