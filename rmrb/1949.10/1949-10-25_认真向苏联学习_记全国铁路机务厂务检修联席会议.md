　　Seriously Learn from the Soviet Union
　　——A Record of the National Railway Locomotive Depot Joint Conference on Maintenance

　　"Without the help of Soviet comrades, we would never have made such progress today." This was the conclusion of Bai Tieyan, director of the Northeast Railway Bureau's Depot Department, when reporting on their work at the National Railway Locomotive Depot Joint Conference on Maintenance. Only by working with Soviet comrades and learning from them can one thoroughly appreciate this statement. Since we learned the Soviet locomotive responsibility system, we have produced national locomotive banners such as the "Mao Zedong," "Iron Ox," and "884" locomotives; the Northeast Harbin Bureau has 23 "Iron Ox Team" locomotives that have safely traveled over 100,000 kilometers, and two "Iron Ox" contract maintenance teams that have safely traveled 800,000 kilometers; this year, the Northeast locomotive A-level inspection has increased from 30,000 kilometers to 50,000 kilometers. Only when the most advanced Soviet spirit of responsibility is implemented in our railway work can our daily car kilometers be generally improved, our technical speed gradually increased, and our depot management have new improvements.

　　For a long time, our railway locomotive workers lacked investigation and research into outer wheel wear, and did not regard the degree of outer wheel wear as an important basis for maintenance. In the Northeast, more than 30 locomotives could not run due to excessively thin outer wheels, causing a lot of damage to the people's railways. However, Soviet comrades told us that the condition of a locomotive should mainly depend on the wear of the outer wheels. In the Soviet Union, outer wheels are inspected every month, and the Minister of Railways has statistics and investigations on the condition of outer wheels. This is what drew our attention, and we began to improve our past shortcomings.

　　Northeast railway depot workers are busy with daily affairs and lack an understanding of planning. However, Soviet comrades are anxiously learning about production, grasping production plans, and have plans for annual, quarterly, and monthly production work. Failure to complete the tasks in the plan will result in punishment. This working attitude, as the Director of the Northeast Railway Depot Department said, is a great inspiration to us, and we have gradually attached importance to the importance of planning and gotten rid of the bureaucratic work style.

　　At the Second Factory Director Conference of the Northeast Railway Bureau, it was decided to adopt the piece-rate wage system suggested by Soviet comrades. Since its implementation, the unreasonable phenomenon of the previous bonus system has been corrected.

　　The Harbin Locomotive Depot Director said that Soviet comrades have given them great improvements in technology, such as locomotive maintenance, air tank repair, and operating technology, and they have learned some new methods. However, when reviewing their work, they particularly pointed out that their spirit of learning from the Soviet Union was not thoroughly implemented. For example, everyone knows that the responsibility system is a good system, but it is not thoroughly implemented in the work. The crew is not fixed, which affects the condition of the locomotive. To this day, this phenomenon has not been improved. Therefore, accidents still occur frequently, and there are still 3.15 locomotive failure incidents per 100,000 kilometers traveled. Ma Jun, Director of the Locomotive Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, also reminded everyone to seriously learn from the Soviet Union and earnestly implement the responsibility system when reporting on his work. He said that today we have not yet generally established a contract maintenance system and contract vehicle system, and our education on the responsibility system is not deep enough, especially the implementation of an important key in the responsibility system—improving technology—lacks serious attention. The current damage accidents and operational accidents, such as loose wheels and overheating of the main shaft, are mainly caused by low technology and failure to implement the spirit of the responsibility system.

　　Minister of Railways Teng Daiyuan has repeatedly called on all railway employees to seriously learn from the Soviet Union at the meetings convened by the Ministry of Railways. He said: "Soviet experts patiently tell us their experience and knowledge, the Soviet Union gives us five hundred kilometers of new rails and accessories, and sends the most experienced experts to China. They follow the progress of the revolutionary situation, from outside the customs to inside the customs, not afraid of hardship, not afraid of difficulties and dangers to help us, and unconditionally help us with the spirit of internationalism." Yes, true friendship and help can only be found in the Soviet Union. "They help us like this, and we don't learn well, it's really too wrong." This is what the Northeast railway workers said to me. We should honestly learn the Soviet management methods and technical theories.

　　认真向苏联学习
    ——记全国铁路机务厂务检修联席会议
    陈迹
    “没有苏联同志的帮助，我们决不会有今天这样的进步。”这是东北铁路总局厂务部长白铁岩在全国铁路机务厂务检修联席会议上报告他们工作时的结论。只有和苏联同志在一起工作并向苏联同志学习，才能透彻地体会到这句话。自从我们学习了苏联的机务负责制，我们才产生了“毛泽东号”“铁牛号”“八八四号”等全国机车旗帜；东北哈尔滨局才有安全行走十万公里以上的二十三台铁牛队机车和安全行走八十万公里的两个铁牛包修组；今年东北机车甲检才由三万公里增高到五万公里。当苏联最先进的负责制精神贯彻到我们铁路工作上，我们的日车公里才会普遍提高，我们的技术速度才逐渐增加，我们的厂务管理才有了新的改进。
    我们铁路机务工作者很长一个时期缺乏对外轮磨耗的调查研究，没有把外轮磨耗程度当作检修的重要根据。在东北有三十多台机车因外轮太薄不能行驶，给人民铁路很多的损害。但是苏联同志告诉我们，机车状态的好坏应该主要依据于外轮的磨耗情形。在苏联，每月都要调查外轮，铁道部长对于外轮的情况都有统计和调查。这样才引起了我们的注意，我们才开始改进了以往的缺点。
    东北铁路厂务工作者天天忙于事务，对于计划性认识不够。但是苏联同志每天紧张地了解生产情况，掌握生产计划，每年、每季、每月的生产工作都要有计划，不完成计划中的任务，是要受处分的。他们这种工作态度，正如东北铁路厂务部长所说，给我们莫大的启示，我们渐渐重视了计划性的重要，摆脱了事务主义作风。
    在东北铁路总局第二次工厂长会议上，决定采用苏联同志建议的计件工资制度。实行以来，纠正了过去所用的超额奖励制度不合理的现象。
    哈尔滨机务处长说，苏联同志在技术方面，给了他们很大的改进，如机车的检修，气罐的修理和操纵技术方面，他们都学到了一些新的方法。但在检讨工作时，特别指出他们向苏联学习的精神，还不够贯彻。比如说，负责制是人人知道的好制度，但在工作中没彻底执行。乘务人员不固定，影响机车的状态。到今天，这种现象还未改进。因此事故还常常发生，每走行十万公里，机车破坏事件尚达三点一五次。铁道部机务局长马钧在报告工作时，也曾提醒大家认真地学习苏联，切实实行负责制。他说，今天我们还没有普遍建立起包修制和包车制，对于负责制的教育也不够深入，特别是执行负责制中一个重要关键——提高技术问题，还缺乏认真的注意。目前发生的破损事故和运转事故，如车轮弛缓，大轴发热等，检讨起来主要是由于技术不高和未贯彻负责制精神而引起的。
    铁道部滕代远部长在历次铁道部所召集的会议上，一再号召全体铁路员工认真地向苏联学习。他说：“苏联专家们把他们的经验学术很耐心的告诉我们，苏联给我们五百公里的新轨及配件，并派来最有经验的专家到中国来。他们随着革命形势的进展，由关外到关内，不怕辛苦，不怕艰难与危险来帮助我们，以国际主义精神无条件的帮助我们。”是的，真正的友谊和帮助，只有向苏联这方面去找。“他们这样地帮助我们，我们再不好好学习，真太不对了。”这是东北铁路工人对我说的话。我们应该老老实实的学习苏联的管理方法和技术理论。
