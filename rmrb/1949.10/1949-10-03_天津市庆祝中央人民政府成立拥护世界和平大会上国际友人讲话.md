    Speech by Mr. Fadeyev, Head of the Soviet Delegation
    The establishment of the People's Republic of China and the Central People's Government is a great festival for all the Chinese people. Our delegation of Soviet cultural, artistic, and scientific workers extends warm congratulations to the great Chinese people.
    The grand celebration of the Chinese people coincides with the International Day of Peace, which has a profound symbolic meaning. The People's Republic of China was born under the banner of its national independence and the banner of equality and friendship among all nations, large and small. It has torn up and overthrown all unequal treaties and privileges of imperialism in China.
    This is the Chinese people's great contribution to the cause of world peace, and also a major defeat for the aggressors. The People's Republic of China was established under the banner of people's democracy, with the people themselves participating in the management of the country.
    It has crushed the fascist terror regime that suppressed the people at home. This is a great contribution of the Chinese people to the cause of peace, and also a fatal blow to the warmongers.
    The People's Republic of China was born under the banner of progressive education, universal education for all the people, cultural prosperity, and creation.
    Everyone knows that the imperialists deliberately practice a policy of obscurantism to oppress their own people so that they can drive them to war and make themselves rich.
    The cultural reforms of the Chinese People's Government have raised the Chinese people to the ranks of the world's progressive forces and overturned the warmongers' entire plan.
    Therefore, in the construction of the new China, that is, in the construction of a unified, independent, democratic, and highly cultured new China, the Soviet people will do their utmost to help the Chinese people with all their strength.
    Long live the eternal friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples!
    Long live the People's Republic of China and its leader, Mao Zedong!
    Long live the great Stalin!
　　Speech by Mr. Spano, Member of the Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party
    Comrades, friends, brothers, and sisters of New China:
    On behalf of the Italian people, on behalf of all those in Italy who refuse to be enslaved by American imperialism and who despise the crimes of the Atlantic Pact, I extend warm greetings to this conference, which expresses the Chinese people's desire for peace.
    In Italy, there are also many great demonstrations for peace. The Italian people participating in the demonstrations—workers, peasants, advanced intellectuals, and the petty bourgeoisie—declare to the reactionary Italian government and to the world: the policy of being an appendage to American imperialism is a policy of war. The Italian people oppose this policy and refuse to be responsible for its consequences. If imperialism invades the Soviet Union, invades the new democratic countries, invades China, the Italian people will never serve imperialism, but will always stand on the other side, striving in every way to fight for peace and freedom.
    The imperialists will not understand this. They vainly believe that our desire for peace is idealistic, they vainly believe that when the time comes, people will follow them to war. Perhaps they understand now, and they understand because the Chinese people have shown that China is not a pacifist like a sheep striving for peace, but is striving for peace in order to crush the forces of war. The victory of the Chinese People's Liberation Army is a victory for peace. This path is correct and should be carried through to the end.
    People of the world, unite and fight for peace! Long live the bulwark of world peace and its great leader Stalin!
    Long live the Chinese People's Liberation Army, which safeguards the forces of peace!
    Long live the People's Republic of China and its great leader Mao Zedong!
　　Speech by Ms. Park Jung-ai, Head of the Korean Delegation
    Dear comrades:
    On behalf of all the people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, I come to celebrate the birth of the People's Republic of China and the establishment of the Central People's Government, and at the same time, I pay tribute to all the Chinese people who have already been liberated.
    Ladies and gentlemen: Today is the day when advanced people in every corner of the world are demonstrating their solidarity in order to strive for peace and democracy and to oppose the new warmongers. Therefore, this conference is a meeting expressing the close unity of all peace-loving people in the world, headed by the Soviet Union, and it is also a meeting where we mutually agree that we will surely be victorious tomorrow.
    The heroic Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong, defeated the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary government aided by American imperialism and achieved today's victory, and at the same time established the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China.
    However, ladies and gentlemen, today, when the new warmongers, headed by American imperialism, are busy preparing for a new war, the brilliant victory of the Chinese people is the greatest blow to the imperialists, and it is making them fall into a pit of death. Therefore, the victory of the Chinese people is the victory of the peace-loving and democratic people of the world. At the same time, this matter gives great encouragement to the Korean people who are fighting with American imperialism for unification and democracy.
    Before us, who are fighting for peace, democracy, and freedom, there are the Soviet Union and hundreds of millions of peace-loving people around the world leading us and supporting us.
    We oppose those who threaten peace until we achieve final victory. Let us advance, closely united around the Soviet Union! Victory belongs to us. Finally, let me shout loudly:
    Long live the Chinese people who have won great victory under the leadership of Chairman Mao!
    Long live the great Stalin, the teacher of all oppressed nations in the world!
    Long live the unity of the peace-loving people of the world!
    Long live the eternal friendship between the Korean and Chinese people!

    天津市庆祝中央人民政府成立拥护世界和平大会上国际友人讲话
    苏联代表团团长法捷耶夫讲词
    中华人民共和国和中央人民政府的成立，是全中国人民的伟大节日，我们苏联文化艺术科学工作者代表团向伟大的中国人民致以热烈的贺礼。
    全中国人民的盛典与国际和平日两个接在一起，这具有着一种象征的深刻的意义，中华人民共和国是在他的国家独立的旗帜下面在世界各个大小民族平等友好的旗帜下面诞生了，他把帝国主义在中国的一切不平等条约或特权一概撕毁了，推翻了。
    这是中国人民对世界和平事业的伟大贡献，同时也是侵略者的大失败，中华人民共和国在人民民主旗帜下建立起来的人民自己参加国家的管理。
    他把国内镇压人民的法西斯的恐怖政权粉碎了，这个是中国人民对和平事业的伟大贡献，同时也是给战争挑拨者以致命的打击。
    中华人民共和国在进步的在全人民普及教育、在文化繁荣和创造旗帜下诞生了。
    大家都晓得，帝国主义者有意的实行愚民政策，压迫自己人民，这样以便驱使人民去打仗，自己发财。
    中华人民政府的文化改革把中国人民提到世界进步力量的行列里面，并且把战争挑拨者的全盘计划推翻了。
    因此，在新中国的建设里，就是在统一的独立民主的有高度文化的新中国的建设事业上，苏联人民对于中国人民尽其所有力量，用最大力量帮助他。
    中苏两大民族永久友好万岁！
    中华人民共和国及其领袖毛泽东万岁！
    伟大的斯大林万岁！
　　意共中委斯巴诺讲词
    新中国的同志们、朋友们、兄弟姐妹们：
    我代表意大利人民，代表所有在意大利不愿受美帝国主义奴役的人民和唾弃大西洋公约罪行的人民，向这个表示中国人民对和平的愿望的大会致热烈的敬礼。
    在意大利也有许多和平大示威，参加示威的意大利人民——工人、农民、先进的知识分子、小资产阶级向反动的意大利政府、向全世界宣布：给美帝国主义作附庸的政策是战争的政策，意大利人民反对这种政策，对这政策及其后果拒绝负责，如果帝国主义侵略苏联，侵略新民主国家，侵略中国，意大利人民绝不为帝国主义服务，而永远站在另一边，用一切办法努力为和平、为自由而斗争。
    帝国主义者不会懂得这些，他们妄以为我们对和平的愿望是空想的，他们妄以为时候到了，人们就会跟他们去打仗；也许他们现在才懂得了，他们所以懂得了是因为中国人民显示了中国不是如绵羊似的和平主义者那样为争取和平，而是为了粉碎战争的力量而争取和平，中国人民解放军的胜利是和平的胜利，这条道路是正确的，应该把它进行到底。
    全世界人民团结起来为和平而斗争，世界和平的堡垒及其伟大领袖斯大林万岁！
    保障和平力量的中国人民解放军万岁！
    中国人民共和国及其伟大领袖毛泽东万岁！
　　朝鲜代表团朴正爱讲词
    亲爱的同志们：
    我代表朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的全体人民来庆贺中华人民共和国的诞生与中央人民政府的成立，同时向已经将已解放了的全中国人民致敬。
    诸位：今天是全世界每个角落的先进人类都为了争取和平与民主以及反对新战争贩子而示威自己的团结的力量的日子，所以这个大会是表示着以苏联为首全世界一切爱好和平的人们的紧密团结在一起的会议，同时也是互相约定明天一定能够获得胜利的会议。
    英雄的中国人民，在中国共产党与伟大领袖毛泽东主席的领导下，打垮了美帝国主义援助的蒋介石反动政府而取得今天的胜利，同时建立了中华人民共和国中央人民政府。
    但是，诸位，今天以美帝国主义为首的新战争挑拨者，它正忙于准备新战争的时候，中国人民的辉煌的胜利对帝国主义者们是一个成为最大的打击，并且使他们陷于死亡的泥坑，因此中国人民的胜利就是爱好和平与民主的世界人民的胜利。同时这个事情对于为统一民主而与美帝国主义战斗中的朝鲜人民予以很大的鼓励。
    为和平民主与自由而斗争的我们面前，有苏联与全世界数万万爱好和平的人们在领导着我们和支援着我们。
    我们反对威胁和平的人们，直到争取最后胜利为止。紧紧的团结在苏联的周围而前进吧！胜利是属于我们的。最后让我高呼：
    在毛主席的领导下争取了伟大的胜利的中国人民万岁！
    全世界被压迫民族的导师伟大斯大林万岁！
    全世界爱好和平的人民团结万岁！
    朝中人民永久友谊万岁！
