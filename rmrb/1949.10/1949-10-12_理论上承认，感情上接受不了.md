　　“Theoretically Acknowledged, Emotionally Unacceptable”
    Ruo Wen
    After reading Li Si's article in the People's Garden on September 30th, which discussed the problem of deviations and even contradictions between theory and action among intellectuals who have not been well reformed, it piqued my interest in this issue because I am also such an unreformed intellectual, and I also have this problem. That article just happened to touch on the problems I have.

    "…Theoretically, I admit you are right, and I knew this before, but emotionally I cannot accept it, and I cannot change it for a while. For unreformed intellectuals like us, thinking through something or a problem in our minds does not mean that we can solve it in action at the same time. Because ideological remolding is a long and arduous process, it must be done slowly!" When other comrades criticize me for a certain problem, I often use this set of arguments to shut them up.

    "…I know I am a bit individualistic and always consider issues from the perspective of personal interests. Originally, eating the people's millet while making personal plans is something everyone knows is wrong, and I am not unaware of it, but now is the process of reform. I can think it through, but I can't do it. What can you do?" When I try to persuade others, I often hit such a snag, making me feel uncomfortable, but I have nothing to say. It seems that after he says this, including himself, what can be done? So the wrong idea is allowed to exist "legally."

    Indeed, the reform of intellectuals is a long and arduous process, but since there are problems, one should and must struggle seriously with oneself in order to make progress. Evasion and avoidance, allowing it to drift, is not in line with the scientific principles of Marxism-Leninism. Marxist-Leninist theory clearly guides us: the only way to solve contradictions is through struggle, criticism and self-criticism, standing on the position of the proletariat, making progressive ideas overwhelm backward ideas, and making the force of looking forward conquer the force of looking backward. Moreover, it also clearly guides us that theory is not dogma, but a guide to action. Only by combining theory with practice can we truly understand theory. This kind of logic of "theoretically acceptable; emotionally unacceptable..." is fundamentally unscientific and is essentially a concrete manifestation of the most weak-willed liberalism, which is very harmful to us. Since we want to progress, we should bravely and unreservedly overcome those non-proletarian -- selfish -- "emotions" and unify theory and practice!

　　“理论上承认，感情上接受不了”
    若文
    读了九月三十日人民园地李思的一篇文章，说没改造好的知识分子的理论与行动偏差甚至背道而驰的毛病，引起了我对这个问题的兴趣，因为我也正是这样一个没改造好的知识分子，也存在着这个毛病，那篇文章也就正好接触到我所存在的问题。
    “…理论上我承认你说得对，而且在这以前我也并不是不知道，只是感情上接受不了，一时改不过来，象我们这种没改造好的知识分子，对一件事情或一个问题，并不是在脑子里一想通，在行动上就能同时解决。因为思想改造是一个长期的艰苦的过程，要慢慢的来！”当别的同志为着某一个问题批评我时，我常是这样搬出这么一套道理来把他的嘴堵住。
    “…我知道，我是有点个人主义，考虑问题老是先从个人利益出发。本来吃着人民的小米，做着个人的打算，是谁也知道不对的，我也不是不清楚，但现在正是改造的过程，我想的通，做不到，你有什么办法？”当我在进行说服别人时，也常是碰这么个大钉子，碰得我怪不舒服，然而却没话说。好象事情经他这么一讲，就连自己也在内，还有什么办法呢？于是错误思想，就让它“合法”存在了。
    不错，知识分子的改造确是一个长期的艰苦的过程，但既然有了毛病，就应该而且必须严肃地自己和自己斗争，才会进步，躲闪规避，任其自流，那就不合乎马列主义的科学原则，马列主义的理论就明明白白地指导我们：解决矛盾唯一的办法就是斗争，就是批评与自我批评，就是站在无产阶级的立场，使进步的思想压倒落后的思想，使向前看的力量征服向后看的力量；而且，更明明白白地指导我们，理论不是教条，而是行动的指针，要理论与实践结合，才是真正的懂得了理论，象这种“理论上接受；感情上接受不了……”的逻辑，根本上是违反科学的，实质上就是一种最软弱的自由主义的具体表现，这对于我们是非常有害的。我们既然要求进步，我们就应该勇敢地毫无顾惜地克服那些非无产阶级的——自私自利的“情感”，使理论和实践统一起来！
