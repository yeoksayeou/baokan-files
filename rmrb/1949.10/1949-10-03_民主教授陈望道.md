Democratic Professor Chen Wangdao

Chen Wangdao is the Dean of the Faculty of Arts at Fudan University in Shanghai.

Since the May Fourth Movement, he has been engaged in the New Culture Movement. In recent years, he has participated in the professors' association organized by democratic professors, cooperating with various struggles for peace, democracy, and freedom. Decades of experience have made him deeply feel that it is impossible to solve any problem in isolation before social problems are resolved. Isn't this also the case with the New Culture Movement? Chen Wangdao said, "Chairman Mao has long indicated the direction of the New Democratic culture and education, which is national, scientific, and mass-oriented. At this CPPCC meeting, further practical solutions were made on how to implement the New Democratic culture and education policy. I am very excited, I finally see the New Culture that has been fought for for so many years, today it is victorious throughout the country."

Speaking of this, he recalled the struggle in the educational circles of Shanghai before liberation: Shanghai is the base point for imperialist aggression against China, and the people of Shanghai also understand imperialist aggression most clearly. Therefore, in the historical anti-imperialist movements, progressive professors, faculty, and the vast number of young students and intellectuals in Shanghai actively participated in heroic postures. Although many professors and students were arrested and killed, they still fought tenaciously, one after another. Chen Wangdao emphasized, "At that time, the Shanghai Professors' Association's struggle for reasonable treatment and the students' anti-hunger struggle were always closely coordinated, supporting and echoing each other, thus forming a huge revolutionary force."

During the People's Liberation Army's war to liberate Shanghai, the educational circles in Shanghai also played its role. Schools organized school protection associations and launched school protection movements, opposing the relocation of schools and the removal of school property, standing guard at night, and preventing the activities and sabotage of reactionary elements. Then, Chen Wangdao excitedly told the reporter a story from the school protection movement at that time. He said, "One day, students from Fudan University were going to celebrate the establishment of the Tongji University School Protection Association. The school authorities wanted the professors to go and dissuade them, but we immediately joined their ranks, beating gongs and drums, and twisting the Yangko dance. When we entered the Tongji University campus, the outside was surrounded by military police, but we still held meetings, gave speeches, sang songs, shouted slogans, and echoed the loud military bugle of the People's Liberation Army in the suburbs."

On the day of Shanghai's liberation, the students in the education sector first launched a wave of welcoming the People's Liberation Army, and the entire Shanghai boiled over. Narrating this, Chen Wangdao became particularly excited. He said, "I can't describe the carnival in Shanghai at that time. What kind of scene should it be when the victory and light that had been longed for day and night for so many years finally arrived? Think about it!" Chen Wangdao felt relaxed and happy in spirit about being specially invited to participate in the CPPCC meeting today, when the Chinese people are about to win complete victory.

Talking about the future tasks of the educational circles in Shanghai, Chen Wangdao believes that if the past was to destroy the old, then the future is to build the new. Studying Marxism-Leninism and studying Mao Zedong Thought is still a starting point today; professors should study more, students should study with peace of mind, and cultivate New Democratic construction talents. Chen Wangdao also firmly believes that in the near future, there will be a thorough transformation in Shanghai's education sector—the influence of imperialism must be eliminated, and the atmosphere of New Democracy must be established.

### 民主教授陈望道

　　民主教授陈望道
    陈望道是上海复旦大学文学院院长。
    “五四”以来，他曾从事新文化运动，最近几年来，参加了民主教授组织的教授联谊会。配合争和平争民主争自由的各种斗争。几十年来的经历，使他深深感到：在社会问题没有解决以前，孤立的解决任何一个问题都是不可能的。在新文化运动方面又何尝不是如此呢？陈望道说：“毛主席早就指示了新民主主义的文化教育的方向，是民族的科学的大众的方向；在这次政协会上，对如何贯彻新民主主义的文化教育政策，作了进一步切实的解决。我很兴奋，我终于看到了多少年来所争取的新文化，今天在全国胜利了。”
    谈到这里，他又回忆到上海解放前的教育界斗争情形：上海是帝国主义侵略中国的基点，上海人民对帝国主义的侵略也看得最明白。因此历史上的几次反帝运动，上海的进步教授、教职员，及广大青年学生知识分子，都是以英勇的姿态积极参加，虽然有不少的教授学生被捕被杀，但仍是前仆后继，顽强斗争。陈望道强调的说：“当时上海教授联谊会要求合理待遇的斗争，和学生的反饥饿斗争，始终是紧紧配合，互相声援呼应，因此形成了一支巨大的革命力量。”
    在人民解放军解放上海的战争中，上海教育界也发挥了他的作用，各校组织护校会，发动了护校运动，反对迁校和搬移校产，夜间站岗放哨，制止反动分子的活动和破坏。接着，陈望道兴奋的向记者讲述了当时护校运动中的一个故事，他说：“有一天，复旦大学的学生要去庆祝同济大学护校会的成立，学校当局要教授们前去劝阻，可是我们却马上参加了他们的行列，打着锣鼓，扭着秧歌，当我们进了同大校院，外面便被军警包围了，但我们仍然开会、讲演、唱歌、呼口号、和市郊解放军响亮的军号声，遥相呼应。”
    上海解放的那天，教育界学生首先掀起了欢迎解放军的热潮，整个上海沸腾了。叙述到这里，陈望道特别兴奋起来，他说：“当时上海的狂欢，我无法形容，多少年来所日夜盼望的胜利和光明，一旦到来，你说应该是个什么情景呢？想想吧！”在中国人民即将获得全部胜利的今天陈望道对这次被特邀参加政协会议，精神上也感到了轻松而又愉快。
    谈到今后上海教育界的任务，陈望道认为：如果过去是破坏旧的，那么今后就是要建设新的，学习马列主义，学习毛泽东思想，今天还是一个起点；教授要多多研究，学生要安心学习，培养新民主主义的建国人材。陈望道并坚强的相信：不久的将来，上海的教育界将要有一个彻底的转变——帝国主义的影响要肃清，新民主主义的气象要建立起来。
