Unveiling a New Page in Chinese Sports History
　　Capital Sports Meet Opens Today
　　The City's Workers, Soldiers, and Students Have Made Full Preparations
　　Over a Hundred Representatives from Provinces and Cities Across the Country Arrive in Beijing to Observe
　　【Our Newspaper's Report】The Beijing People's Sports Meet opens today. This is the first large-scale sports meet involving workers, soldiers, students, and citizens of the entire city held to celebrate the founding of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China. Its content is entirely mass-oriented, collective, and revolutionary sports movements, which is fundamentally different from the previous sports meets of a few people, individual heroism, and championship-ism. The holding of this sports meet will play a demonstrative role nationwide, so as to launch popular sports activities. Therefore, after the notice of holding this sports meet was issued, it immediately aroused enthusiastic responses in factories, troops, and schools in the capital. Workers, soldiers, and students competed to participate, and gave full play to their high degree of collectivism and creativity, actively preparing for novel events.
　　Over Twenty Units of Workers Participate in Competitions and Performances
　　In the factory sector, more than twenty enterprises participated in competitions and performances. For example, the workers of Shijingshan Power Plant used their spare time to specially rehearse a "Workers' Exercise" with 120 people to participate in the conference performance. Postal workers, who had never participated in sports meets, also participated in the men's 800-meter relay and tug-of-war, basketball and other competitions, and a 20-person Tai Chi exercise performance.
　　Battlefield Heroes and Sports Ground Athletes, Soldiers Perform Soviet Bayonet Drill
　　In the military sector, the North China Military Region participated in "Attire and Armed Race Walking"; soldiers of a certain division guarding the capital performed the meaningful "Army, Navy, and Air Force Marching into Taiwan"; and a certain unit of the Disciplinary Corps, whose busy duties at the People's Political Consultative Conference had just ended, also participated in the "Bayonet Drill Performance," including two-person sparring, advancing thrusts, striking actions, and heroic sparring (wearing protective gear). More than sixty participants went to Tiananmen Square early in the morning to practice. Even when dismissed for rest, they still practiced automatically, in groups of three or two. They felt it was an honor to represent the troops at the conference. They performed the Soviet-style "bayonet fighting," which has many advantages: the movements are flexible, and some striking actions are not found in the Japanese-style "bayonet fighting"; the posture is stable, allowing for free advance and running. It can also extend one foot further than the Eastern-style bayonet fighting, striking distant enemies.
　　Teachers and Students of Various Schools Collectively Create Joint Performances by Thousands
　　In schools, a craze for creating collective new programs has been set off. Huada performed "Long Live the People's Republic of China" with 200 people; students of Normal University collectively performed "Unite, Democratic Youths, Defend World Peace." In the preliminary selection, almost all primary and secondary schools and kindergartens in the city participated in the programs. Guanghua Girls' High School, with over four hundred students from junior high to senior high, all participated in the performance of "Great Unity Gymnastics." The content is divided into fifteen sections, using movements to express the process of the birth of the Communist Party of China, the arduous struggle behind enemy lines, and the victory and liberation of the whole country. This was created by the school's physical education teacher, Ma Jide, and the school's teachers and students, based on the Soviet sports review and sports books, learning the spirit of Soviet collective performance. In order to facilitate the performance of female students, the "two-person average exercise" part of the program was also researched and improved during practice. Before participating in the sports meet, Xinsheng Middle School, in conjunction with the organized programs, carried out ideological education to promote collective activities and oppose "championship-ism" and the "star system." This time, they organized and mobilized two-thirds of the school (more than 2,000 people) to participate in the first People's Sports Meet. The collective performances included "character formation," "changing formations," and "waist drum dance." Many primary schools jointly performed a program together. This not only made the program rich and exciting, but also demonstrated a high degree of unity. Sixteen primary schools in the fifth district jointly performed "Democratic Youth Dance"; eleven primary schools in the first district jointly performed gymnastics character formation; twenty-one primary schools in the eleventh district, with more than 1,300 people, jointly participated in a character formation program. During practice, there were many problems in clothing and technology due to the large number of people and the scattered schools, but due to the unity and mutual assistance among the children, all difficulties were easily solved. For example, when uniforms were not enough, elementary school students launched a borrowing clothes movement; when time was difficult, they seized the common spare time to practice. The technology of character formation was collectively created by the Physical Education Teaching Material Research Association of the eleventh district, and the physical education teachers of each school also participated in the students' team to hold red flags, with teachers and students performing together. Students of the New China Women's Vocational School, who will graduate in one year, also participated in a new program "Youth Dance" despite their busy studies. During their spare time, relying on the enthusiasm of their classmates, everyone worked together, encouraging and supervising each other. After a week of spare time intensive preparation, they rehearsed proficiently. Students from Mongolian and Tibetan schools specially participated in the performance of "Tibetan Dance" and "Mongolian Exercises," introducing their national arts to the people of the capital. The Tibetan dance program is the most popular "Spring Outing" among Tibetans, with nine men and nine women participating in the performance, all wearing Tibetan costumes. The Mongolian exercises are performed by eighty-one people using gymnastic movements to show the Mongolian people's expertise in horse riding, lassoing horses, pulling bows and other movements.
　　【Our Newspaper's Report】The Beijing People's Sports Meet, which marks a new direction for people's sports, will be held at the Temple of Agriculture today (the 22nd). Sports circles from provinces and cities across the country have organized delegations to visit Beijing. As of yesterday, a total of 117 representatives from Jilin, Liaoning, Liaoxi, Rehe, Songjiang, Heilongjiang, Shenyang, Lüda, Harbin, Tianjin, Taiyuan, Baoding, Chahar, Hebei, Xi'an, Wuhan, Shanghai, Nanjing, Jinan, Qingdao and other places have arrived in Beijing. The basketball team of the Shanghai delegation will also participate in the conference performance.

　　揭开中国体育史新页
  　首都体育大会今开幕
    全市工人士兵学生已作充分准备
  　全国各省市代表百余人抵京参观
    【本报讯】北京市人民体育大会今天揭幕。这是为了庆祝中华人民共和国中央人民政府成立举办的包括全市工人、士兵、学生、市民的第一次大规模体育大会，内容完全是大众化的、集体的、革命的体育运动，与过去少数人的、个人英雄主义、锦标主义的运动会有本质上的不同。这次体育大会的举行，在全国将起示范作用，借以展开普及的体育运动。故当举行这次体育大会的通知发出以后，立刻在首都各工厂、部队、学校里起了热烈的反应，工人、士兵、学生们争先参加，并且发挥了高度的集体性和创造性，积极准备新颖项目。
    廿余单位工人参加竞赛表演　
    在工厂方面，有二十多个企业部门参加了竞赛和表演节目。如石景山发电厂的工人们利用工作的余暇，特别排演了一百二十人的“工人操”，以参加大会表演。有史以来没参加过运动会的邮政职工，也参加了男子八百米的接力及拔河、篮球等竞赛和二十人的太极操表演。
    战场英雄操场健将士兵表演苏联刺枪
    在部队方面，华北军区参加了“着装与武装竞走”；警卫首都的某师战士表演有深刻意义的“海陆空军进军台湾”；在人民政协繁忙勤务刚刚结束的纠察总队某部也参加了“刺枪表演”，内容有二人对刺、行进突刺、打击动作、英勇对刺（戴护具）等项。参加的六十多人，一早起来就去天安门练习，解散休息时还自动的练，三人一群，两人一伙就对刺起来。他们觉得能代表部队出席大会是光荣的。他们表演的是苏联式的“刺杀”，这种“刺杀”优点很多：动作灵活，有些打击动作是日本式的“刺杀”所没有的；姿势稳固，能够前进自由和跑步。并且还比东洋式刺杀能多伸出一尺远，刺击远处敌人。
    各校师生集体创作千百人联合大表演
    在各学校里，更掀起了创作集体性新节目的热潮。华大二百人表演“万岁，中华人民共和国”；师大学生集体表演“团结起来，民主青年们保卫世界和平”。在预选中，全市中小学及幼稚园，差不多都参加了节目。光华女中全校由初一到高三的四百多学生全体参加表演“大团结体操”，内容共分十五节，以动作表演出由中国共产党的诞生、在敌后艰苦奋斗、以至胜利花开，全国解放的过程，这是该校体育教员马骥德与全校师生根据苏联的体育大观及体育书籍，学习苏联集体表演的精神所创造的。并为使女同学表演方便，在练习中又研究改进了节目中的“二人平均运动”部分。新生中学在参加体育大会之前，配合着所组织的节目，进行了发扬集体活动、反对“锦标主义”“明星制”的思想教育，他们这次组织、动员了全校三分之二（二千余人）的同学来参加首次的人民体育大会，集体表演中有“组字”、“变换队形”、“腰鼓舞”等。许多小学都联合起来共同表演一个节目，这样不仅能使节目充实精彩，且发挥了高度的团结性。第五区的十六个小学联合共同表演“民主青年舞”；第一区有十一个小学联合表演体操组字；第十一区有二十一个小学一千三百多人联合参加一个组字节目。练习时因为人多、学校分散，在服装上、技术上的问题很多，但由于小朋友间团结互助，各项困难都迎刃而解。例如制服不够，小学生间就展开借衣服运动；时间困难，就抓紧在共同课余时间练习。组字的技术是由第十一区体育教材研究会集体创造，各校体育教员也都参加到学生的队伍里掌红旗，师生共同表演。一年就毕业的新中国妇女职业学校学生，在功课繁忙中也参加了一项新节目“青年舞”，她们在课余中凭着同学的热情，大家动手，互相勉励督促，经一星期的课余突击准备，就排演熟练了。蒙藏学校的同学特别参加表演“西藏舞”和“蒙古操”，将他们的民族艺术介绍给首都人民。西藏舞的节目是在藏族间最流行的“春游”，由男女各九人参加演出，完全着藏族服装。蒙古操是由八十一个人用体操方式表演蒙古人民擅长的骑马、套马、拉弓等动作。
    【本报讯】标志着人民体育新方向的北京人民体育大会今（二十二）日在先农坛举行。全国各省市体育界纷纷组织代表团来京观光，迄昨日止，已有吉林、辽宁、辽西、热河、松江、黑龙江、沈阳、旅大、哈尔滨、天津、太原、保定、察哈尔、河北、西安、武汉、上海、南京、济南、青岛等地代表共一百十七人莅京。上海代表团篮球队并将参加大会表演。
