　　The Fearless Power
    Introducing "The Young Guard"
    Chen Dake
    "The Young Guard" is a film adapted from Alexander Fadeyev's novel. It depicts the heroic deeds of a group of Communist Youth League members active in the German-occupied territories during the Soviet Great Patriotic War.
    The film uses the power of art to vividly and profoundly express the strong will, ardent patriotism, confidence in victory, spirit of self-sacrifice, and great heroic spirit of this group of Communist Youth League members.
    Here, we see them energetic, fearlessly facing the threat of death, and under the leadership of the Bolsheviks, closely linked with the masses, organizing resistance. They are so brave and fearless, inspiring residents with news of the motherland's victory, strengthening their belief in victory and the courage to resist. When arrested, they stubbornly confronted the enemy's torture and bravely and calmly walked to the execution ground.
    But, they are all a group of honest ordinary people who love their motherland, love labor, and live happily. They still celebrate their festivals in the most difficult environments; even in prison, they are just as lively and happy. And it is this group of people who created unprecedented immortal deeds. Who gave them this power?
    Soviet life, socialist reality, is the only source of this power. Under its nurturing, they grew into a completely new generation with high communist qualities. They are all spiritual giants of the great Stalinist new era, and fascism was destroyed by millions upon millions of such people.
    The years of war have passed. The Soviet people are now using this true and strong power to carry out peaceful construction, leading the people of the world in defending world peace. Before this irresistible force, all despicable attempts to undermine world peace will, like the German invaders, meet with a shameful demise.

　　无畏的力量　
    介绍“青年近卫军”
    陈大可
    “青年近卫军”是一部根据法捷耶夫的小说改编的电影。它描写苏联伟大卫国战争时期，活跃在德寇占领区，一群共产主义青年团团员们的英勇事迹。
    电影以艺术的力量，生动深刻地表现出这一群共青团员们的坚强的毅力，火炽的爱国热情，对胜利的信心，自我牺牲的精神，和伟大的英雄气慨。
    在这里，我们看到他们精神充沛，无畏地面对着死亡的威胁，在布尔什维克的领导下，与群众紧密联系，组织抵抗。他们是如此勇敢和临危不惧，并以祖国胜利消息，鼓舞居民对胜利的信念和反抗的勇气。当被捕后，他们倔强地对付敌人的酷刑，勇敢而坦然地走上刑场。
    但，他们都是一群诚实的普通的人，爱祖国，爱劳动，愉快地生活。他们在最艰险的环境中，仍然欢庆着自己的节日；甚至在监狱里，他们也是同样活泼和快乐。而也就是这一群人，却创造出史无前例的不朽的事迹。是谁赋与他们这一种力量呢？
    苏维埃生活，社会主义现实，便是这力量的唯一源泉。在它的哺育下，他们成长为完全新的一代，具有高度的共产主义的品质。他们都是伟大斯大林主义的新时代的精神巨人，法西斯主义便是为千千万万这样的人们所毁灭的。
    战争的岁月已经过去。苏联人民正以这一种真实坚强的力量，进行着和平的建设，领导全世界人民捍卫着世界的和平。在这一支不可抗衡的力量之前，一切可鄙的破坏世界和平的企图，必会如同德寇一样地，遭到可耻的覆灭。
