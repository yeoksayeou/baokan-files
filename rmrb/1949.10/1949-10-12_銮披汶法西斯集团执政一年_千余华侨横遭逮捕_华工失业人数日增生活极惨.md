Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 11th – Bangkok Dispatch: Since the Phibun military fascist group regained power in Thailand, the plight of overseas Chinese has worsened. Since June 15th of last year, the reactionary authorities, under the pretext of "secret societies," "lack of identification cards," or "identification cards without stamps," have carried out large-scale arrests of overseas Chinese in Bangkok and the interior. As of September this year, over one thousand overseas Chinese have been arrested. In addition to those imprisoned or fined, the majority have been deceived and expelled from the country under the guise of being "non-essential residents." Dozens have even been driven to the malaria-ridden province of Bimiwen to reclaim wasteland, where they are subjected to all kinds of servitude and oppression.

Currently, the Thai authorities impose extremely strict restrictions on the entry of overseas Chinese. Only two hundred people are allowed to enter each year, whereas before Phibun came to power, the number was ten thousand annually. This August, the Thai parliament passed a new immigration law, further restricting the entry of overseas Chinese. Even tourists are detained and expelled if the authorities deem them "suspicious elements."

While carrying out large-scale anti-communist and anti-Chinese activities, the Phibun government has recently been gradually adopting a fascist police system. The police authorities strictly check the identity cards of overseas Chinese and have announced that overseas Chinese who do not have identity cards or whose identity cards do not have sufficient annual stamp fees will be deported. At the same time, from next year onwards, all matters relating to overseas Chinese identity cards, changes of address, and even departures and entries will be under the jurisdiction of the police. Since June of this year, the police have already begun investigating and registering overseas Chinese. Workers, teachers, shop assistants, and even business owners have been subjected to "investigation and registration." The police are also considering establishing so-called "concentration villages" (i.e., concentration camps) to detain our compatriots on various pretexts.

The businesses of overseas Chinese have been devastated by the various exclusions and restrictions imposed by the Thai authorities. The number of unemployed Chinese workers is increasing daily, and living conditions are extremely dire. In February of this year, the Thai authorities announced that overseas Chinese were prohibited from engaging in ten occupations, including hairdressing, making Buddha statues, and operating rickshaws. As a result, nearly 100,000 overseas Chinese were directly or indirectly affected, with over a thousand in the hairdressing industry alone. In May, the Thai Ministry of Interior passed another law adding eight more occupations, including rubber and soda, in which overseas Chinese were not allowed to operate. It also ordered the eight types of factories (such as dim sum food, dyeing, rice noodles, and tofu) operated by overseas Chinese in Bangkok and its neighboring province of @武里 to move out of the city within a specified period. In this situation, more than 100,000 overseas Chinese employees are facing destitution. Not only that, the so-called "veteran organizations" formed by the fascist military group are dedicated to seizing the economic rights and interests of overseas Chinese, using their privileges to exclude overseas Chinese workers, businesses, and agriculture, and monopolize everything. For example, the slaughtering industry, the liquor industry, the charcoal industry, train transportation, and the shipping industry are all monopolized and manipulated by them, employing Thai workers and excluding Chinese workers. On the other hand, they often break into Chinese shops and residences under the pretext of searching for "communists" and "firearms," extorting money at will. Thai gangsters even openly rob Chinese people of their watches and pens on the streets or in cars.

Overseas Chinese education has even less freedom. Under the unreasonable "Private School Regulations," overseas Chinese in Thailand are fundamentally unable to establish schools. From the time Phibun took office (November 1947) until the end of July this year, a total of 279 overseas Chinese schools, including the only nine secondary schools for overseas Chinese, have been sealed off, leaving more than 20,000 students out of school. In August of this year, the Thai authorities again prohibited students over the age of fourteen from studying in Chinese schools and revoked the teaching qualifications of Chinese language teachers who had not passed the Thai language test.

The Phibun government uses every means to suppress progressive Chinese newspapers, having searched the Quan Min Bao (People's Daily) twice and arrested four staff members. In April of this year, it also implemented censorship on the Zhen Hua Bao (Truth Daily), the Quan Min Bao, and the Min Zhu Xin Wen (Democratic News), forcing the Zhen Hua Bao to cease publication.

### 銮披汶法西斯集团执政一年　千余华侨横遭逮捕  华工失业人数日增生活极惨

　　銮披汶法西斯集团执政一年
    千余华侨横遭逮捕
    华工失业人数日增生活极惨
    【新华社北京十一日电】曼谷消息，泰国自銮披汶军事法西斯集团重新执政以来，华侨受害愈烈。自去年六月十五日起，反动当局即借口“秘密结社”、“没有身份证”或“身份证没有印花”等理由在曼谷及内地大举逮捕华侨。迄今年九月止，共逮捕华侨一千人以上。除被监禁或罚款者外，大部以“非必要居留者”的借口被骗逐出境，甚至有数十人被赶到瘴疫流行的碧美汶府开荒，遭受百般的奴役和压迫。
    现泰国当局对华侨入境限制极为严格。每年只允许二百人入境，而銮披汶上台以前为每年一万名。今年八月，泰国会又通过新移民条例，更进一步限制华侨入境，即使是游客，只要当局认为是“可疑分子，即将其扣留逐出。
    与大规模进行反共排华同时，銮披汶政府近来正在逐步采取法西斯警备制。警察当局严格检查华侨随身证，并宣布：未做随身证或有随身证而未贴足每年印花例费的华侨，都要驱逐出境。同时，从明年起，一切有关华侨随身证，迁移地址，以至出境入境等都将归警察管辖。今年六月起，警察业已开始调查登记华侨，工人、教员、店员以至各业业主都受到“调查登记”。警方更正在考虑设立所谓“集中村”（即集中营），用种种借口拘禁我侨胞。
    华侨工商业在泰国当局种种排斥和限制下被摧残殆尽。失业华工人数日增，生活极惨。今年二月间，泰国当局宣布理发、制造佛像、三轮车等十种职业不许华侨操作，因而直接或间接受影响的华侨近十万人，仅理发业一项即有千余人。五月间，泰内务部又通过法令另增树胶、汽水等八种职业不许华侨经营，并令曼谷及其邻府＠武里华侨所经营的八种厂坊（如点心食品、染坊、米粉、豆腐等）限期搬出市区。在这种情形下，有十余万华侨员工已面临绝境。不仅如此，法西斯军人集团所组成的所谓“退伍军人机构”专门抢夺华侨经济权益，借其特权排斥华侨工、商、农业，垄断一切。例如屠宰业、酒业、炭业、火车运输与航运业等莫不受其垄断与操纵，雇用泰工，排斥华工。另一方面又常借口搜查“共产党”、“军火”等随意闯入华侨商店与住宅，横行勒索。泰国流氓甚而在路上或汽车上公然抢劫华侨所带的手表和钢笔。
    华侨教育更无自由可言。在不合理的“民校条例”下，泰国华侨根本不能设立学校。自銮披汶执政（一九四七年十一月）迄今年七月底为止，共有华侨学校二百七十九所，其中包括华侨仅有的九所中学在内，悉被查封，失学学生二万余人。今年八月，泰当局复禁止十四岁以上的学生在中国学校读书，并取消未考泰国文的华文教员执教资格。
    对于进步的华文报纸，銮披汶政府更用一切方法加以压迫，曾经搜查全民报两次，捕去职员四人。今年四月间，又对真话报、全民报与民主新闻实施新闻检查，因而使真话报被迫停刊。
