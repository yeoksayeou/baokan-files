Chapter 1: Overview of Plague

I. Disease Name
	1. Scientific names: Plague, Black Death, Pestis.
	2. Local names: Chou Ma (臭麻), Lao Shu Wen (老鼠瘟, Rat Plague), Wen Yi (瘟疫, Plague), Ge Da Wen (疙疸瘟), He Zi Wen (核子瘟).

II. Pathogen (Omitted)

III. Source of Infection
	Before the plague spreads among humans, it invariably circulates among rodents for approximately two to four weeks. Wild rats, mountain rats, house rats, guinea pigs, field squirrels (bean weevils), marmots, etc., can all be infected. Additionally, domestic dogs and cats can carry fleas and transmit them to others.
	Patient tissues, tissue fluids, blood, sputum, feces, urine, fleas, etc., can directly transmit the disease.
	Contaminated or toxic objects and animals can transmit the disease indirectly.

IV. Entry Points of the Virus
	Damaged skin and mucous membranes, tonsils, respiratory organs, and conjunctiva of the eyes are all entry points for infection into the body.

V. Clinical Symptoms
	1. Incubation period: Two to seven days (exceeding 10 days is extremely rare).
	2. Prodromal symptoms: Rare, or a few may experience headaches, dizziness, and limb pain.
	3. Systemic symptoms: Sudden chills and shivering, high fever (39 to 41 degrees Celsius), facial expression of horror; headache, dizziness, conjunctival congestion, generalized dryness, sensation of heat, weak and impure heart sounds, or murmurs, rapid pulse, sometimes nausea, vomiting, enlarged liver and spleen, slurred speech, staggering gait as if drunk, severe cases may lead to unconsciousness.
	4. Individual Symptoms
		(A) Bubonic Plague: The most common type of plague (90%), also known as plague lymphadenitis, characterized by swollen glands. Usually, the inguinal (groin) lymph nodes are most frequently affected, followed by axillary and cervical lymph nodes. After onset, the lymph nodes gradually swell, initially firm and movable, becoming red, swollen, and enlarged when adhering to surrounding tissues (but sometimes not obvious), with extreme pain, often followed by suppuration, bleeding, ulceration, and a purplish-black color.
		(B) Pneumonic Plague: Usually caused by respiratory infection or secondary to bubonic plague or septicemic plague. In addition to severe systemic symptoms, pneumonia symptoms occur, including coughing, chest pain, sputum, bloody sputum, difficulty breathing, and cyanosis of the lips and nails. Patients with this type die quickly, approximately in two to three days.
		(C) Septicemic Plague: Sudden onset with chills, high fever, often with impaired consciousness, skin and mucous membrane hemorrhages, enlarged spleen and liver, sometimes vomiting and diarrhea. This type of disease is extremely severe, leading to death in as little as two or three hours, and at most one or two days.
		(D) Cutaneous Plague: Mostly secondary to bubonic plague, primary cases are rare. Initially, the skin shows hemorrhagic punctate infiltration, then becomes pustular like large bedsores, eventually ulcerating into sores, with necrotic tissue appearing dark black. The general symptoms of this type are usually milder.
		(E) Ocular Plague: In addition to milder systemic symptoms, local eye symptoms occur. This type is extremely rare.
	5. Cause of Death:
		The cause of death from plague is the effect of toxins, leading to acute heart failure.

VI. Plague Mortality Rate
	1. The mortality rate for pneumonic plague and septicemic plague is almost 100%. If large doses of sulfonamide drugs are taken early, some can be cured.
	2. The mortality rate for bubonic plague is 60% to 90%. If sulfonamide drugs are taken, it can be reduced to 20% to 30%.

VII. Treatment
	1. Principles
		A. According to the principle of "early detection, early reporting, early isolation, early treatment," the earlier the treatment, the better.
		B. Early excision or incision is the principle for bubonic plague.
		C. The use of sulfonamide drugs should follow the principle of concentrated force, large-dose shock therapy (gradually reducing the dose).
		D. Always pay attention to the patient's general condition, especially the heart condition.
	2. Treatment Methods, Treatment Methods for Bubonic Plague:
		A. Surgery
			(1) Lymph node excision.
			Indications: (a) Within three days of onset, likely to recover, but without suppuration or necrosis of the skin and local area. (b) Mild systemic symptoms, no severe cerebral symptoms. (c) Although local suppuration or necrosis exists, the overall condition is good.
			Contraindications: (a) Severe systemic symptoms or extensive local necrosis. (b) Late detection or other complications (such as osteomyelitis, endocarditis, pneumonia, etc.).
			Surgical methods and combined local drug therapy: Surgical methods are the same as for general lymph node excision. If the lymph node tissue is healthy in color or completely excised, sulfonamide powder can be sprinkled, and the first suture performed.
			(2) Lymph node swelling incision: If the opportunity for early excision has been lost, and suppuration or self-ulceration has occurred, early incision can also be performed. Fully drain pus, sprinkle sulfonamide powder, and apply antiseptic dressing.
		B. Drug Therapy
			(1) Sulfonamide usage method: Should be taken with an equal amount of soda. Dosage: First, give a large dose of 3 to 4 grams, then give 2 to 3 grams every four hours. On the second day, take once every four hours, giving 2 grams each time. Thereafter, take once every four hours, giving half a gram to one gram each time, until the fever subsides. When taking large doses of sulfonamides, instruct the patient to drink more boiled water to reduce the side effects of the drug.
			(2) Maintaining cardiac strength and physical strength therapy: Keep warm;
			Inject cardiac stimulants. May be injected continuously if necessary, or inject physiological saline, Ringer's Solution, or blood transfusion.
		Pneumonic plague, septicemic plague (apply the above-mentioned drug therapy for early detection).
		Cutaneous plague, ocular plague: Early excision or removal, while applying the above-mentioned drug therapy.

VIII. Epidemic Prevention Guidelines
	(I) Preventing Virus Invasion
		1. Cut off traffic, establish land and water quarantine, to prevent the invasion of patients, diseased rats, and diseased fleas.
		2. Suspected patients and those who have been in contact with patients must be isolated for a certain period (10 to 14 days).
		3. Items and equipment used by patients should be thoroughly disinfected.
		4. The transportation of fur, used bedding, etc., should be prohibited.
	(II) Eradicating the Source of Infection
		1. Patients and suspected cases should be detected and isolated early.
		2. Corpses and dead rats should be disinfected and buried in soil eight feet deep or cremated.
		3. Excrement, utensils, bedding, housing, etc., of patients should be appropriately disinfected.
		4. Pay attention to the escape of diseased rats and eliminate fleas.

　　防治鼠疫工作人员须知
    东北防疫委员会编
    第一章  鼠疫概论
    一　病名
    １、学名：鼠疫，黑死病，百斯笃。
    ２、土名：臭麻，老鼠瘟，瘟疫，疙疸瘟，核子瘟。
    二　病原菌（略）
    三　传染根源
    鼠疫在人类流行之前，约二至四周，必先在鼠族流行，野鼠、山鼠、家鼠、豚鼠、田栗鼠（豆触子）、旱獭等均能感染。此外家犬及猫能带跳蚤，再传染他人。
    患者组织，组织液，血液，痰，粪，尿，蚤等能直接传染。
    含毒或附毒物件及含病毒动物行间接传染。
    四　病毒侵入的门户
    皮肤及粘膜损伤处，扁桃腺，呼吸器，眼结膜均为传染进入体内的门户。
    五　临床症状
    １、潜伏期：二至七日（超过１０日者极少）
    ２、前驱症状：稀有，或少数发现头痛，眩晕、四肢痛者。
    ３、全身症状：突然恶寒战栗，发高热（摄氏三十九至四十一度）颜貌呈恐布状：头痛，眩晕，结膜充血，全身干燥，热感，心音微弱不纯，或有杂音，脉搏频数，有时恶心，呕吐，肝、脾均肿大，言语含糊，走路蹒跚，有如醉酒，重者意识不明。
    ４、各个症状
    （甲）腺鼠疫：为鼠疫中最常见之病型（百分之九十），又称鼠疫性淋巴腺炎，以腺肿为其特征。通常以鼠蹊部（腹股沟部）淋巴腺肿为最多，次为腋窝淋巴腺及颈部淋巴腺。发病后，淋巴腺渐次肿胀，初时硬结可移动，至与周围组织愈着时即呈红肿高大（但有时不著明），疼痛异常，其后常自化脓，出血，溃烂，呈紫黑色。
    （乙）肺鼠疫：通常由呼吸器感染，或由腺鼠疫，鼠疫败血症转变续发。除剧烈之全身症状外，同时发生肺炎病状，即咳嗽，胸痛，吐痰，血痰，呼吸困难，口唇及指甲呈青蓝色等。本型病人死亡较快，约二至三日。
    （丙）鼠疫败血症：突然战栗，高热而发病，意识多半不明，皮肤及粘膜出血，脾、肝肿大，有时吐泻。本型病状极为剧烈，最快二、三小时，最多一、二日内即死亡。
    （丁）皮肤鼠疫：多为腺鼠疫之续发，原发较少。最初皮肤为出血性点状浸润，其后成脓疱如大褥疮，最后溃烂成疡，坏死组织呈暗黑色。本型一般症状亦较轻。
    （戊）眼鼠疫：除较轻之全身症状外，发生眼之局部症状，本型极少。
    ５、死因：
    鼠疫之死因，乃毒素作用，致起急性心脏衰弱。
    六　鼠疫死亡率
    １、肺鼠疫及鼠疫败血症，死亡率几为百分之百，如早期大量服用磺胺类药物，亦有能治愈者。
    ２、腺鼠疫死亡率为百分之六十至九十，如服用磺胺制剂则能减少至百分之二十至三十。
    七　治疗
    １、原则
    甲、根据“早期发现，早期报告，早期隔离，早期治疗”的原则，治疗愈早愈佳。
    乙、腺鼠疫以早期摘出或切开为原则。
    丙、磺胺制剂之使用，应以集中力量，大量突击疗法（渐次减量）为原则。
    丁、要时时注意患者的一般状态，特别是心脏状态。
    ２、治疗方法、腺鼠疫之治疗方法：
    甲、手术
    ①、淋巴腺摘出术。
    适应症：（一）发病三日以内，可能愈者，但皮肤及局部无化脓或坏死者。（二）全身症状轻微，无严重之脑症状者。（三）虽局部化脓或坏死，而全身状态良好者。
    禁忌症：（一）有严重之全身症状，或局部高度坏死者。（二）晚期发现或其他合并病症者（如骨脏炎，心内膜炎，肺炎等）。
    手术方法及局部药物合并疗法：手术及方法与一般淋巴腺摘出术同。如摘出时淋巴腺组织为健康色，或彻底摘出者，可撒布磺胺粉末，行第一次缝合。
    ②、淋巴腺肿切开术：已失去早期摘出之机会，且已化脓或已自溃者，亦可早期切开。充分排脓、撒磺胺粉末，施以防腐带。
    乙、药物疗法
    ①、磺胺剂使用法：应配合同量之苏达服用，其用量：第一次大量给与三至四克其后每四小时给与二至三克。第二日每四小时内服一次，每次给与二克。其后每日每四小时内服一次，每次给与半克至一克，至下热时为止。服大量磺胺剂可嘱病人多喝开白水，以减少药之副作用。
    ②、保持心力及体力疗法：保温；
    注射强心剂。必要可连续注射，或注射生理食盐水，林盖儿Ｒｉｎｇｅｒ　Ｓｏｌｕｔｉｏｎ或输血。
    肺鼠疫鼠疫败血症（早期发现者应用上述约物疗法）。
    皮肤鼠疫，眼鼠疫：早期切除或摘出，同时应用上述之药物疗法。
    八　防疫方针
    （一）防止病毒侵入
    １、断绝交通，设直水陆检疫，以防止病人、病鼠及病蚤之侵入。
    ２、可疑之病人及曾接触病人者，须隔离一定期间（十天至十四天）。
    ３、接触病人之物品、器械等应彻底消毒。
    ４、应禁止皮毛类、旧被服等之运搬。
    （二）灭绝传染根源
    １、病人及疑似者应早期发现及隔离。
    ２、尸体及死鼠消毒后掩埋于八尺深之土中或火烧之。
    ３、病人之排泄物、使用器具、被服、住屋等宜施行适宜消毒。
    ４、注意病鼠之逃窜，并消灭跳蚤。
