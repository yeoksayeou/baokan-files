Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 28th—Factories, schools, and organizations in Shenyang City are protesting the atrocity of American citizen Wald, who unreasonably beat worker Ji Yuheng. The person in charge of the Shenyang City Federation of Trade Unions issued a statement saying, "Wald's provocative act of violence must be dealt with by our People's Government according to the law to safeguard the laws and regulations of the People's Republic of China. We extend our cordial greetings to injured worker Ji Yuheng on behalf of the 200,000 workers in Shenyang and pledge to be his strong support." At the advanced elements' activity meeting held by the Shenyang Railway Branch Federation of Trade Unions, a telegram protesting the atrocities of American imperialist elements was unanimously passed. When the workers of the factories under the Machinery Bureau of the Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government heard this news, they were all indignant. Tian Zengfang, a worker at the Motor Vehicle Plant's Parts Factory, said, "We can no longer tolerate such insults and oppression. Hitting Ji Yuheng is like hitting myself." Jiang Yingyun of the Fifth Machinery Factory said, "Not long ago, the spy organization directed by the US Consulate in Shenyang was cracked down by the People's Government, and today Wald dares to beat a Chinese worker. We demand severe sanctions." All the employees of the Telecommunications Machinery Factory of the Northeast Post and Telecommunications Administration donated 1.01 million yuan at a factory-wide meeting to express their sympathy to worker Ji Yuheng and put forward their opinions on punishing the murderer to the Shenyang People's Court. Organizations such as the Preparatory Committee of the Shenyang City Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, the Shenyang City Democratic Youth Federation, and the Shenyang City Student Union also jointly issued a statement saying, "We, over 10,000 members of the Youth League, over 30,000 middle school and university students, and over 200,000 young people in Shenyang City, resolutely protest the atrocities of the imperialist element Wald and express our sympathy to worker Ji Yuheng. We appeal to the peace-loving people of the world and support the People's Court in punishing the murderer." Teachers from major and middle schools and primary schools in Shenyang City have also expressed their opinions, demanding that the government punish the murderer Wald.
