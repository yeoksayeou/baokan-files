　　Situ Meitang Issues Statement
  　Guangzhou's Liberation Inspires Overseas Chinese to More Actively Return to the Country to Invest and Build
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Situ Meitang, the representative of overseas Chinese in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, recently issued a statement on the liberation of Guangzhou, stating:

    Regardless of how Chiang Kai-shek, Li Zongren, Yan Xishan, and other bandits clamor about "defending the bandit suppression base of Guangzhou," under the courageous southward advance of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, it is now easily defeated and fleeing in disarray. The homeland of revolutionaries is once again glorious, and the revolutionary people are celebrating liberation together. The news has arrived, and we are infinitely excited. Guangzhou was the last major port in China occupied by the American-Chiang reactionary forces. The liberation of Guangzhou signifies the final demise of the American-Chiang remnant bandits, turning them into vagrant bandits. Guangzhou is also a crucial hub with connections to overseas countries in all directions. The liberation of Guangzhou will accelerate the recognition of our People's Republic by various countries around the world. Guangzhou is also the provincial capital of the hometown of overseas Chinese. The liberation of Guangzhou spiritually inspires overseas Chinese and increases their confidence in investing in the construction of the motherland. From the Opium War, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, the Xinhai Revolution, the Northern Expedition, the Guangzhou Commune, the Land Revolution, to the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Liberation War, in this long struggle history of one hundred and nine years, our Guangdong people have always been a people of long-term revolutionary struggle, earth-shattering and involved in every battle. This kind of history is extremely precious. Now, thanks to the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese nation has completely turned itself over. Our Guangdong compatriots must intensify their efforts under the leadership of Chairman Mao to assist the People's Liberation Army and local people's governments at all levels to quickly establish revolutionary order, restore social prosperity, eliminate bandits and special agents, stabilize the rear, intensify production, and strive to support the front. Overseas Chinese should actively return to the country to invest and facilitate remittances, so that the entire territory of Guangdong can be liberated as soon as possible, and strive to build a new Guangdong that is prosperous, happy, peaceful, and where people can live and work in peace and contentment.
