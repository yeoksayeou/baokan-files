　　The Black Stone Slope Coal Mine Chronicle (5)
    Kang Zhuo
    Fifth Mine Opening

　　The village had finished its opera performances, and the weather had reached early November. By this time, everything at the mine was in order. Da San established regulations for both inside and outside the mine, and allocated the recruited people into three shifts, day and night, to start digging the mine entrance and building the roadway. At the time, Xi Lu personally sat in the accounting room, and hired a man named Lin Bao to manage the accounts and the sales area. He also had Yu Bao working under Da San as a foreman, overseeing the miscellaneous workers and operations. Other diggers, carriers, leaders of different branches, and odd-job workers were also from the village. Many of the older ones were Da San's former colleagues, and there were quite a few good miners like Tian Lu. The younger ones were mostly his nephews and grandchildren. With enough manpower and the village lacking coal mines, everyone was eager to work. So things went smoothly. Only Yu Bao occasionally made some remarks about Da San behind his back, but fortunately, these didn't spread. People also saw that Da San was skilled at giving guidance and making arrangements for the operations. If anyone was inefficient in their work, he would kindly ask and personally demonstrate as an example. Everyone couldn't help but admire him and followed his instructions closely, and there were no major mistakes in the mine.

　　After working for a month or so, people saw that the mine entrance was dug, and the roadway had been carried quite far inside. Coal was visible less than five feet into the mine entrance, and the coal was strong and yielded a lot. It was truly productive, and they felt that Da San was indeed capable. So they valued this mine even more. In the depths of winter, those with idle hands and feet often came to the mine site in the northwest corner of the opera stage, squatting around the large coal fire to watch the mine opening. The miners from the other six earth kilns in the village visited daily, especially Tai Cheng, who managed the earth kilns for the village landlord Zhang Jubao. He would come to inspect the mine up and down and kept praising how well it was being opened. As a result, coupled with the villagers and outsiders coming to carry coal and the animals carrying coal, the mine site became very lively. People simply moved the space in the sunny area across from the opera stage where they used to tamp the earth over to this side.

　　Xi Lu also came to the mine site almost every day on time. He was all smiles, saying a few words, helping Lin Bao calculate the accounts and weigh the coal. Then he would take off his cotton coat, and Da San and Yu Bao, lighting their oil lamps, would lead him down to the bottom of the mine to take a look. Sometimes he would even take someone's pickaxe and dig a few times, or take someone's carrying basket and carry a load of coal up to the mine. In this way, Da San became even stricter with the operations, losing the little bit of hometown sentiment he had when he first returned to the village. Regardless of who it was, he would not compromise on the work. The workers also seemed afraid of losing face in front of strangers, so they mostly worked hard. A few of the more playful ones could never outargue Da San, and had to follow his regulations. Seeing that the mine's operations were getting better day by day, Da San's reputation also grew day by day.

　　However, Yu Bao wasn't very happy inside. Yu Bao had a cousin named Niu Bao, only twenty years old, who worked as an odd-job worker at the mine. He would often skip work and be lazy. Niu Bao had worked with Yu Bao in the mines near Yangquan since he was young, and had also carried goods and delivered cargo at the train station, making a living by being cunning and opportunistic. He often said, "I've seen plenty of capable people! I'm not afraid of anyone!" His sister-in-law was a widow, and Yu Bao had an affair with her. Yu Bao was already unhappy with Da San, so he allowed Niu Bao to skip work at the mine, protecting him and not saying anything. Niu Bao was happy to work on and off. In one eight-hour shift, he would come up from the bottom of the mine ten or eight times. Da San had long been unable to bear it, and severely scolded him once. But Niu Bao refused to accept it. He kicked his worn-out straw sandals far away with his left foot, put his hands on his hips, and shouted, "I can't do this job! I quit! I'm leaving!" Da San said, "Are you afraid I can't find you with my oil lamp? Quit? Ask your foreman!" At this moment, Tian Lu was coming up from the bottom of the mine and quickly pulled Da San aside without saying a word. Da San lit his oil lamp and went down into the mine. Behind him, Niu Bao shouted again, "I've seen people more capable than you! Humph! I'm not afraid of you!" Only then did Yu Bao stop him. People persuaded him for a long time, and finally, Niu Bao was sent back down to the mine to work. Unexpectedly, Yu Bao said unhappily, "Ask me if he quits! But he doesn't ask me if he should be scolded! He doesn't assign me what I should say! He's been working in big mines outside for decades, but this is how he makes the rules!" Da San happened to be coming up from the bottom of the mine and, upon hearing this, pointed at Yu Bao with his oil lamp and said, "I told you once at the northeast intersection at the bottom of the mine! I told you again in front of the Liu Gou family's house near the temple! I also asked you to persuade him properly, but you're publicly accusing me of being wrong!" Yu Bao couldn't save face for a moment and shouted at Da San, "You say you can find people with your oil lamp, you go find people to quit! I can't persuade people, I can't find people either!" It looked like they were about to have a fight. People quickly pulled them apart. The small foreigner also fluttered his eyes, humming, as if teasing a child, or as if angry. His short legs jumped back and forth, pushing this one to that side and that one to this side, saying, "You're all doing the same work! It's a small matter, what's there to argue about! Alas..." Both sides were still arguing. Da San threw his hat aside, bulging his eyes, tightening his arms, and raising his fist. Yu Bao also unbuttoned his cotton coat. The small foreigner was so anxious that he called him Yu Bao nephew on one side and Da San uncle on the other, shouting loudly. Just then, the Liu Gou family on the hillside came out to dump stove ashes. Seeing the situation at the foot of the slope, he stood on the ash heap and shouted, "Small foreigner! You're uncle on this side and nephew on that side, be careful not to call them the wrong way around. You might not be able to mediate the quarrel and end up with everyone suffering!" These words unintentionally made everyone laugh, and the two arguing men awkwardly walked away, leaving the small foreigner coughing and scolding towards the hillside.

　　After this, Da San looked for Xi Lu and proposed quitting. Xi Lu said, "If you don't do it, who do you want me to ask to do it! You finally came home, and I finally relied on you. Can you just watch this half-way operation be abandoned?" These words hit Da San's sweet spot, and he had no choice but to continue. But he also proposed replacing Yu Bao. Xi Lu negotiated with Yu Bao twice, and also pulled Yu Bao to apologize to Da San. Afterwards, Yu Bao really changed his ways, working hard and earnestly, as if he wanted to compete with Da San. Da San also remained silent and continued as before.

　　By March of the following year, the weather had warmed up, and the apricot blossoms in the village had bloomed. The young women and daughters-in-law, who mostly couldn't afford to wear cotton in the winter and could only stay by the coal fire at home, now also came out of their doors, watching from afar on the hillside and by the opera stage near the foot of the slope, watching this newly opened big mine. This big mine finally didn't have any mistakes and was successfully opened.

　　Now, the mine entrance is six feet high and six feet wide, and the roadway at the bottom of the mine is also five feet high and five feet wide. Three connected branch roads have also been dug in the coal pit. In several less secure areas, Da San installed canopies supported by pillars and horizontal beams. In several places where a few drops of water were dripping from the walls, Da San also dug a few small pits under the dripping water, and only half a person's labor was needed each day to bail the water clean. In one winter, the mine had already produced eight or nine hundred tons of coal. Now, twenty or thirty people can go down every day, producing ten or twenty tons of coal, and the animals carrying coal go straight up and down, supplying coal to the iron furnaces and households in the three nearby villages, and also supporting the livelihoods of thirty or forty households in the village. Fifty years ago, after the Black Stone Slope village had a major mine collapse, there hadn't been a mine in the village that could be called a big mine, and the lives of the poor in the village were even more difficult. Now, this mine has become the first big mine in the whole village, and it has also found more work for the poor in the village and solved some of their difficulties.

　　黑石坡煤窑演义（５）
    康濯
    五开窑
    村里唱过了戏，天气已到了十一月初，这时窑上万事妥贴，大三就给窑里窑外定出了规章，并把召来的人拨调成每天日夜三班，动工凿窑口担行道。当时喜禄亲自坐柜房，并请了个叫林宝的给管帐管卖场，又叫玉宝在大三手下当间工头，总管那些闲杂工人和闲杂营生，别的刨头担头领岔的和间工，也都是本村人，年岁大些的多是大三当年的伙计，象天禄那样的好窑黑就不少，青年们又尽是他侄儿孙儿辈，人手也全，村里本又缺窑，现在大伙有了干的，劲头很大，因此动弹起来倒还顺当；只玉宝有时在人前人后说大三两句闲话，幸好这些也都没传开，人们又见大三营生上头指点拨调头头是道，谁要是营生不利索，只要好意问他，他必亲自下手干个榜样，大伙不免暗暗佩服，紧照他的意思干下去，窑里头没出什么差错。
    动弹了个把月，人们看着窑口凿开了，行道也往里担得不近了，进窑口不到五尺就见了炭，炭也强，也出得不少，可真是作出活来了，觉着大三也真有两下，于是对这窑更看重起来了；十冬腊月，闲手闲脚的就短不了到戏楼西北角的窑口场面上，圪＠在那炉大炭火跟前，来看开窑，村里别的六座土窑上的窑黑们，更是每天必到，特别是给本村财主张聚宝经管土窑的泰成，还短不了来这窑上窑下察看，并一个劲吹说这窑开得不赖；这么一来，加上本村和外村来担炭的人和驮炭的牲口，这窑场可真是一片热闹，人们就干脆把戏楼对角太阳地里闲捣拉的地势也搬过这边来了。
    喜禄每天也差不多都按时到窑场上来，他满脸是笑，说道两句，帮林宝算算帐、挂挂秤，就把棉大袄一脱，大三跟玉宝点着下窑用的油扁灯，一前一后，领着他下窑底看看，有时他还拿过别人的＠头刨两下炭，或是接过别人的担筐，担一担炭上窑来。这么着，大三对营生就把得更严更紧，刚回村时候那点乡亲情面也没有了，不管对谁，活计上头决不含糊，工人们也象是怕在生人面前丢人一样，大多是使着劲干，有几个跳皮些的，总也斗不过大三讲把式说道理，也只得按大三的规章干下去；眼看窑里的营生真是一天强比一天，大三的名声，也一天比一天响起来了。
    不过，玉宝心里却不怎么痛快。玉宝有个叔伯兄弟叫牛宝，才二十岁，在这个窑上当间工，隙会跳皮偷懒；这牛宝从小就跟玉宝在阳泉左近下过窑，也在火车站上扛过脚、送过货，耍乖弄巧地混过饭吃，开口闭口会说这么一句话：“我他妈的见过有本事的多的是！我怕谁咬了我个球！”他嫂是个寡妇，跟玉宝又有一手勾扯，玉宝原本又不高兴大三，因此便让牛宝在窑上跳皮，袒护他，不说他；他也正好干干歇歇，上一班工八个钟头，总要从窑底上来呆个十回八回。大三实在早看不过意，就狠狠吹了他一回，他却不服，一股劲左脚一踢左脚一踢，把脚上踏拉着的一对破片片鞋撂得远远地，两手叉腰嚷道：“我干不了这营生！退工！我走！”大三说：“你怕我点着油扁还寻不见个人？退工？问你间工头去！”这时天禄正从窑底上来，忙一声不响地拉开了大三，大三就点着油扁下窑去了；后边牛宝却又嚷道：“我他妈可见过比你还有本事的！哼！我怕你！”玉宝这才止住他，人们又劝说了半天，总算又打发牛宝下窑动弹去了；谁知猛不防玉宝却挺不高兴地说：“退工就叫问我！可该不该说他就不问我！该我说的也不指派给我！他还是外边大窑里几十年的把式，可就这么个规章的！”不想大三正从窑底下上来，听了这话，忙使油扁指着玉宝道：“我头一回在窑底下东北岔道北墙根跟你说过！二一回在庙底下柳沟家门前又跟你说过！我还叫你好好劝说他的，可你当着这么些人瞎摊派我不是！”玉宝一时拉不下脸，也冲着大三嚷道：“你说你点油扁寻得着人，你退工寻人去！我劝说不了人家，我也寻不下人！”看架势，二人象要咯吵一场了，旁边人们赶紧左拉右劝，小洋鬼也忙忙扑展着眼皮，“呵”着个嘴，象逗小孩玩，又象生气一般，两条短腿来回跳着，把这个往这边推推，又把那个往那边推推，说道：“都干的是一手营生嘛！淡事情，有个什么说头！唉唉……”两边却还在顶嘴，大三把礼帽也撂到一边，鼓着两只大眼，勒着胳膊挥起拳头，玉宝也解开了棉袄钮扣；小洋鬼只急得这边叫他玉宝侄儿，那边叫叫他大三叔叔，使劲嚷着。恰好这时半坡上柳沟家出门倒炉灰，见了坡根这情由，就站到炉灰堆上嚷道：“小洋鬼！你这边叔叔那边侄儿的，留点神别颠倒叫错了，可劝架没劝住，还落个大伙吃亏哟！”这话无意中笑倒了众人，两个嚷嘴的也蹩蹩扭扭地走开了，只剩得小洋鬼一边咳嗽一边朝半坡骂。
    此后，大三找过喜禄，提出不干，喜禄说：“你不干你说叫谁干！你好不容易回得家来，我也好不容易靠托上了你，你就能看着把个半路营生给撂了？”这话说对了大三的脾性，他也只好干下去；但他还提出要把玉宝换了，喜禄却跟玉宝捣拉了两回，又拉着玉宝给大三赔了个不是，往后玉宝也真的换了个样，狠心卖劲实打实干营生，心眼里象是要跟大三比试比试一般，大三也就不言不语照旧干下去了。
    到了来年三月，天气也暖和了，村里杏花也开过了，大闺女小媳妇们，一冬天多是穿不上棉，只能在家里煤火跟前呆着的，这时也都出了大门，在半坡上，在坡根戏楼边，远远看看这个新开的大窑。这大窑总算是没出差错，顺顺当当开成了。
    现在，这窑的窑口高宽各六尺，窑底行道也都有五尺高五尺宽，炭坑里还刨开了三道通连的岔道，在几处不很保险的地势，大三又安上了立柱横梁架起的顶棚，有几处墙头滴嗒两滴小水，大三也在滴水的下面刨了几个小坑，每天只用半个人工就能把水挑干净；一个冬天，窑里已经出了八九百吨炭，现在每天能下去二三十号人，出一二十吨炭，驮炭的牲口直下直上，供给了左近三几个村铁炉上的用炭和家户的烧炭，也养活了本村三几十户人家。五十年前，黑石坡村塌了一座大窑以后，村里就没有称得起大窑的了，村里穷人的生活也更遭难了；现在这座窑就成了全村头一座大窑，也给村里穷人多找了点干的，多解决了点困难。
