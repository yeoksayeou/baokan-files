Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 18th: Simonov, the deputy head of the Soviet cultural, artistic, and scientific workers delegation, delivered a speech at the Sino-Soviet celebration evening organized by the Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association on the 16th. The full text is as follows:

　　Dear friends!

　　We, the delegation of Soviet cultural, artistic, and scientific workers, representing millions of Soviet intellectuals, have come to your great new democratic China to pay our respects to the Chinese people and to the Soviet friends present here today!

　　We, representing Soviet cultural workers, tell you, tell our friends, that the friendship between our two great nations has a great past. When we think of the source of this friendship, we will think of the sacred names of the entire advanced humanity – the name of Lenin and the name of Sun Yat-sen. We Soviet people have always been good friends of the Chinese people, have always warmly sympathized with the Chinese people’s struggle for liberation, and have always deeply respected the Chinese cultural workers and Chinese intellectuals who have fought for freedom together with the Chinese people in long and arduous struggles!

　　Today, the friendship between our two great nations has a great present. The Chinese people, thanks to the great unity of all progressive forces in China and the Chinese Communist Party and their leader Mao Zedong, have won a great victory in the struggle against American imperialists and against all domestic and foreign oppressors of the Chinese people; this truly opens up a broader path for the cultural workers of the two countries who are striving to consolidate the friendship between the two great nations and further enhance the Chinese people's understanding of Soviet culture and the Soviet people's understanding of Chinese culture.

　　The friendship between our two great nations will have a great future. The experience of the Soviet Union over the past thirty-two years has shown how quickly people who have been liberated from the rule of oppressors and who have gained power in their own country can reach the peak of culture. The experience of the Chinese people's liberation struggle also shows this. After gaining power, the Chinese people are also advancing rapidly to the peak of culture, forever forward. The friendship between our two great nations will surely enrich each other's cultures in the future. Therefore, a vast field of activity has unfolded before the cultural workers of our two countries, China and the Soviet Union. We Soviet cultural workers are very pleased with the warm and thoughtful reception extended by the Chinese social organizations that invited us. We have the opportunity, on the one hand, to recognize the countless relics and achievements of the great ancient culture of the Chinese people, and on the other hand, to understand the tremendous achievements of modern New Democratic China in culture, art, and education. After we return to the Soviet Union, we must tell the Soviet cultural workers who sent us to China about these achievements of the Chinese people and the Chinese cultural forces. This is our task.

　　But we know that this is only the beginning of the great work before us. We also need to translate the great works of Chinese classical and modern literature into the languages of all Soviet nationalities, and we also need to widely introduce all the most moving scenes of the new Chinese cultural life to the Soviet people. Dear friends, we assure you that we will do everything in our power to systematically and effectively complete this arduous but glorious task in the coming years.

　　We know that our friends, the Chinese cultural workers, are also willing to widely introduce the achievements of Soviet culture to Chinese intellectuals and the Chinese people. Here, on behalf of the Soviet cultural workers who sent us here, we would like to assure our Chinese friends that we are determined to do everything in our power to help you understand everything you want to know about Soviet culture. We will definitely help you in this regard, and we are willing to work hard to achieve this goal.

　　Dear friends, on behalf of the Soviet cultural workers, we thank the Chinese people for the grand and warm welcome given to us in Shanghai and wherever we have been. We understand that you welcome us in this way because you welcome us as the most beloved friends of your country – the representatives of the Soviet Union. We will certainly convey to the comrades who sent us to China that you have shown sincere and friendly feelings towards every Soviet intellectual and the Soviet people when you received us.

　　Long live the People's Republic of China! Long live the great Chinese people, one of the world's advanced nations!

　　Long live the friendship between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union!

　　Long live Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people!

　　Long live the friend of progressive humanity worldwide, the great Stalin!

　　上海中苏联欢晚会上
  　西蒙诺夫演说
  　保证尽力交流中苏文化
    【新华社上海十八日电】苏联文化、艺术、科学工作者代表团副团长西蒙诺夫十六日在中苏友好协会上海分会筹备委员会所主办的中苏联欢会上的演说，全文如下：
    亲爱的朋友们！
    我们苏联文化、艺术、科学工作者代表团，代表千百万苏维埃知识分子，到你们的伟大的新的民主中国来，向你们中国人民，向今天到会的苏联的朋友们致敬！
    我们，代表苏联文化工作者，告诉你们，告诉我们的朋友们，我们两大民族的友谊是有着伟大的过去的。当我们想起这友谊的源泉的时候，我们就会想起整个先进人类的神圣的名字——列宁的名字和孙中山的名字。我们苏联人一直是中国人民的好朋友，一直是热烈同情中国人民的解放斗争，一直是深深尊敬在长期艰苦奋斗中和中国人民一起为自由而战斗的中国文化工作者和中国知识分子的！
    今天，我们两大民族的友谊，又有了伟大的现在。中国人民由于中国所有的进步力量和中国共产党和他们的领袖毛泽东的大团结，在反对美帝国主义者和反对中国人民的所有国内外的压迫者的斗争中，赢得了巨大的胜利；这对于努力巩固两大民族友谊和进一步使中国人民更好地认识苏联文化，使苏联人民进一步认识中国文化的两国文化工作者们，是真正开辟了一条更广阔的道路。
    我们两大民族的友谊，更会有伟大的未来。苏联建国三十二年来的经验显示了：在从压迫者统治下解放了的人民，在自己国家里获得了政权的人民，是多么迅速地达到文化的高峰。中国人民解放斗争的经验也显示了这一点，中国人民在获得了政权以后，也同样迅速地向文化的高峰前进，永远前进。我们两大民族的友好，一定会使两国文化在将来更加相互丰富起来。因此，在我们中苏两国人民文化工作者面前展开了广大的活动园地。我们苏联文化工作者由于约请我们的中国社会团体的那样热烈殷勤的招待而感到非常高兴。我们有机会，一方面认识了中国人民伟大的古代文化的无数遗迹和成果，另一方面也了解了现代新民主主义中国在文化、艺术、教育各方面的巨大的成果。我们回到苏联之后，一定要将中国人民和中国文化力量的这种成果，告诉派我们到中国来的苏维埃文化工作者们，这就是我们的任务。
    但是我们知道，这不过是摆在我们面前的巨大工作的开始。我们还要把中国古典和现代文学的伟大作品译成苏联各民族的文字，我们也要把新中国文化生活的一切最动人的情景，广泛地介绍给苏联人民。亲爱的朋友们，我们向你们保证，我们要尽一切力量，在今后几年中，有系统地，有效地完成这一艰巨但却是光荣的任务。
    我们知道，我们的朋友，中国的文化工作者也愿意把苏联文化的成就，广泛地介绍给中国知识分子和中国人民，这里，我们愿代表派我们到这里来的苏联文化工作者，向我们的中国友人们保证：我们决定尽我们的一切精力，来帮助你们了解你们所要了解的关于苏联文化的一切情形，我们一定在这一方面帮助你们，我们愿意为达到这一目的而努力工作。
    亲爱的朋友们，我们代表苏联文化工作者感谢中国人民，在上海，以及在我们所到的任何地方给予我们的那种盛大热烈的欢迎。我们懂得，你们这样欢迎我们，是把我们当作你们国家最亲爱的友人——苏联的代表——而欢迎，我们回去一定转达给那些派我们到中国来的同志们说：你们在招待我们的时候，表现了对每个苏联知识分子和苏联人民的真诚的友好的感情。
    中华人民共和国万岁！世界先进民族之一，伟大的中国人民万岁！
    中苏两大民族友好万岁！
    中国人民领袖毛泽东万岁！
    全世界进步人类的友人，伟大的斯大林万岁！
