The Shandong Bohai Agricultural Experiment Station conducted an experiment this spring in Xiaolüjia Field, Huimin, on the effect of winter-plowed land on cotton seedling emergence. The results showed that cotton fields that had been winter-plowed had very even emergence, almost 100% seedling rate, while those that had not been winter-plowed only had about a 60% seedling rate. A general survey of cotton seedling emergence was also conducted in ten villages in the experimental area near the farm. One farmer, who had received all Sizi cotton seeds, achieved an 80% seedling rate when planted on winter-plowed land, but only a 40% seedling rate when planted on land that had not been winter-plowed. On average, spring-plowed land had a seedling rate of only 50%, while winter-plowed land had a seedling rate of 80% to 90%.

In 1946, the Jiaodong Farm in Chengnan Village, Laiyang, applied fertilizer to the fields and plowed them in the previous year. The cotton planted the following year had more even seedling emergence and grew more vigorously, with larger leaves and thicker stems, and earlier flowering than fields that were fertilized and plowed just before planting. According to past experience, not only is this good for growing cotton, but it is also better for growing other crops than spring-plowed land. Last year, the Jiaodong Farm conducted an experiment at the Laiyang City farm, and found that winter-plowed land produced better growth and higher yields for all crops.

If time permits, winter plowing can be changed to winter hoeing. In late autumn and early winter, the land can be deeply hoed with a hoe, which is even more effective than winter plowing. Che Guixin, a Jiaodong labor hero from Xiguxian, Yaqian, said: One year, his family had five mu of land in the northwest depression. The three brothers hoed two mu in the winter, and then hoed the remaining three mu in the following spring. When they planted spring corn, the two mu that had been winter-hoed grew particularly well, with tall stalks and large ears.

The reason why winter-plowed or winter-hoed land has even seedling emergence and good growth is:

First, because the soil is loose when it is plowed or hoed in the winter, it absorbs more water from rain and snow, making it drought-resistant, and making it easier for spring seedlings to emerge evenly and grow vigorously.

Second, after winter plowing or hoeing, the subsoil is turned to the surface. After a winter of wind, sun, and frost, the fertilizers and nutrients that have accumulated in the subsoil for many years and are not easily absorbed by crops can be evenly distributed in the layers of the tilled soil, fully supplying the crops for absorption and enjoyment. As the saying goes, "winter plowing is like applying manure," which is the reason for this. As for the weeds and fallen leaves that are buried in the soil during winter plowing and rot, they naturally increase the fertility of the soil. The roots of weeds and wild vegetables can also be frozen to death, preventing them from growing and affecting the growth of crops.

Another reason is that after winter plowing, the bean worms, ginger worms, grubs, and many other pests in the soil will be turned to the surface and eaten by birds and animals. If it is very cold when winter plowing is done, many of the insects that are not eaten will also freeze to death. Winter plowing and hoeing can kill many pests lurking in the soil, which is widely recognized and acknowledged in various regions.

If women and children can be specifically organized to pick up the insects that are plowed out during winter plowing and hoeing, then the pests will of course be further reduced.

In summary, winter plowing and hoeing can loosen the soil, increase moisture and fertility, and reduce the occurrence of weeds and eliminate many pests. It is inevitable that it will result in even seedling emergence and vigorous growth of crops.

Editor's note: The winter plowing mentioned in the article is actually autumn plowing.

### 冬耕的好处在那里？

  　冬耕的好处在那里？
    山东渤海农业试验场，今春在惠民小吕家场子里，试验冬耕地对棉花出苗的结果是：凡冬耕过的棉花地，都出的很齐，可说是十成苗，没有冬耕的，不过六成苗。又在农场附近实验区中十个村作了一般的棉花出苗调查。有一户农民全是领到的斯字棉种，种在冬耕地里够八成苗，种在没冬耕的地里，才出到四成苗。平均起来，春天耕的地不过出五成苗，而冬耕的则出苗八成到九成。
    胶东农场一九四六年在莱阳城南村场子里，头年把粪送到地里耕起来，第二年种上棉花，比现使粪现耕的地出苗齐，并且生长旺，叶子大，茎子粗，开花也早。根据以往经验，不但种棉花好，即是长别的庄稼也同样比春天耕的地好。去年胶东农场在莱阳城场子曾作过试验，无论种什么庄稼都是冬耕地长的好，收获丰。
    如果有时间能将冬耕改为冬刨，秋末冬初的时候，用镢头把地深深刨起，作用比冬耕更大。胶东劳动英雄，牙前西古岘车桂欣说：有一年他家西北洼里的五亩地，兄弟三人，一冬刨了二亩，第二年春又刨了其余的三亩，种上春玉米，冬刨的二亩，长的特别好，秸子高，穗子又大。
    冬耕冬刨的地所以出苗齐，长的好，原因是：
    第一因为冬天耕刨起来的地土松，一般大的雨雪，它吸收的水分多，抗旱，春苗便容易出齐，也容易旺盛。
    再就是冬耕冬刨后，地底下的生土翻到地面，经过一冬的风吹、日晒、冰冻，多年积集在土底下不易被庄稼吸收的肥料养分可以匀配在耕土的各层，充分供给庄稼吸收享用，俗语说“冬耕如上粪”，就是这个道理，至于冬耕时掩在土中腐烂了的杂草，败叶，自然也增加土壤的肥效。杂野草菜的根也能冻死，不致生长出来影响庄稼长成。
    另有一个原因，就是冬耕以后，地理的豆虫、姜虫、蛴螬和其它许多害虫，也会因为翻到地面，被飞禽走兽吃掉。如果冬耕时天已很冷，不被吃掉的虫子，也会冻死很多。冬耕冬刨可以杀除许多土里蛰伏的虫子，各地都已多数认识与承认。
    冬耕冬刨时如果能够特地跟了妇女儿童拣净耕出来的虫子，那么害虫当然会更加减少。
    总计来说，冬耕冬刨，既可以疏松土壤，增加水分，肥力，又能够减少杂草的发生，消除很多的害虫，它能使庄稼出得齐，长得旺，当然是必然的事情了。
    编者按：文中所说冬耕即秋耕。
