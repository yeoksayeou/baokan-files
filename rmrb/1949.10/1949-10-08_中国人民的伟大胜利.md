Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 7th: TASS Moscow News: On October 6th, the "Izvestia" published an editorial entitled "The Great Victory of the Chinese People," the full text of which is as follows:

　　The great Chinese people, numbering four hundred and seventy-five million, have won a historically significant victory in the struggle against the combined forces of domestic reactionaries and international imperialism. They have crushed the strength of the anti-national, rebellious Kuomintang clique, which American imperialism tried every means to support. Representatives of the Chinese people, gathered in the People's Political Consultative Conference, proclaimed the establishment of the People's Republic of China on October 1st and elected the Central People's Government headed by Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese Communist Party.

　　Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Chinese people have for the first time in history taken power into their own hands. With the support of the powerful socialist and democratic camp, they have begun to address the fate of their motherland, which has groaned under the iron heel of foreign avarice for a century. This great nation has won national independence in a heroic war of liberation, and now the road to prosperity and independent development has been opened for China. Overthrowing the corrupt Kuomintang clique that betrayed the nation and engaged in feudal oppression and colonial exploitation, the Chinese people are laying the cornerstone for a people's democratic state.

　　This country is led by the working class, based on the worker-peasant alliance, and unites all democratic classes and all ethnic minorities in China.

　　The People's Liberation Army has liberated the enemy-occupied territories. North China and Central China have already been liberated. A considerable part of South China has been liberated, and now the army of the People's Republic is approaching Guangzhou, the only major port still occupied by the defeated Kuomintang remnants.

　　While carrying out the important task of completing the revolutionary war victoriously, the Chinese Communist Party is organizing the people's peaceful and constructive efforts in the liberated areas. The life of the vast country is being reformed and rebuilt according to democratic principles. Land reform has been implemented in the Northeast and North China. More than one hundred million landless and poor peasants have been allocated land confiscated from landlords and national traitors. Industrial and agricultural enterprises confiscated from the Kuomintang reactionaries and the Chinese bureaucratic bourgeoisie closely related to foreign capital have become part of the state-owned economy; the state has begun to implement a program to raise the material and cultural standards of the people. Revolutionary and creative work is in full swing throughout the country, inspiring and attracting more and more people to participate in historically significant activities.

　　The great events currently taking place in China once again demonstrate the profound correctness of Comrade Stalin's vision. As early as 1925, he said: "In China, the forces of the revolutionary movement are enormous. They have not yet been fully expressed. But they will be in the future. The rulers of the East and the West who do not see these forces and do not give them due consideration will suffer for it... Here, truth and justice are entirely on the side of the Chinese revolution. That is why we now and in the future sympathize with the Chinese revolution, which is carrying out the struggle to liberate the Chinese people from the shackles of imperialism and to unify China into one country. Whoever does not take this force into account now and in the future is bound to fail."

　　The epoch-making victory of the Chinese people, which led to the establishment of the People's Republic of China, demonstrated the complete bankruptcy of the rebellious and anti-national conspiracy of the Kuomintang reactionary clique and the imperialist plans of the United States. For twenty-two years, Chiang Kai-shek, a thorough reactionary, and the clique he led, had repeatedly sold out the Chinese people to British imperialists, German fascists, Japanese militarists, and American imperialists. With the help of international reactionaries, these traitors to national interests intended to maintain the corrupt and decaying feudal landlord system in China and to maintain the privileges of the exploiting classes. The Kuomintang people obediently acted as foreign lackeys in China. Carrying out the orders of their American masters, they participated with particular frenzy in the loud clamor of the warmongers. The Kuomintang reactionaries, following the orders of their American masters, attempted by every possible means to stifle democratic forces, strangle the people, and ensure that American imperialism could carry out colonial exploitation of China, turning China into a bridgehead for implementing the military aggression plans of world reactionaries in the Far East.

　　However, all these irrational plans of the imperialists and their Kuomintang lackeys miscalculated. The Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, in their tenacious struggle for the freedom and honor of their motherland, frustrated all the plots of world reactionaries, and they would not allow China to continue to be exploited by the United States. The imperialist colonial system has been broken in one of its most important links. Comrade Stalin's prediction has come true. Many years ago, Comrade Stalin pointed out: "China's anti-imperialist struggle must have a broad mass character and a significant national character, and it must gradually deepen to the point of engaging in fierce struggles with imperialism and shaking the foundations of world imperialism." Having freed themselves from the shackles of imperialism and domestic reactionaries, China has joined the ranks of nations that uphold the cause of peace, democracy, and socialism. Article 11 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference states: "The People's Republic of China unites with all peace-loving and freedom-loving countries and peoples in the world, especially with the Soviet Union, the people's democratic countries, and the oppressed nations, standing on the side of the international peace and democracy camp, jointly opposing imperialist aggression, and safeguarding lasting world peace."

　　The historic victory of the new China of the people has strengthened the forces of the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism, headed by the powerful Soviet Union, and greatly weakened the forces of the imperialist camp.

　　The friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples has prospered and grown on a deep and solid foundation. The oppressed masses of all countries regard the Great October Socialist Revolution as a guarantee of their liberation. The October Revolution not only shook the center of imperialist rule but also struck at the imperialist hinterland, as Stalin said: "Destroying the rule of imperialism in colonies and dependent countries." The people of the oppressed nations of the East consider the Soviet Union to be the only country that builds its life on the principles of national equality and cooperation. Experience tells them that the Soviet government is the only government in the world that consistently upholds the unity and independence, freedom and sovereignty of all countries, large and small, colonies and dependent countries. The people of the oppressed nations of the East once regarded the Soviet Union as an inspiring example of getting rid of imperialism, and they still do so now.

　　The epoch-making achievements of the Soviet people inspired the working masses of China to oppose imperialism and feudal oppression, teaching them to unite around the Chinese Communist Party—the true leader of the Chinese people—in their historically significant cause of liberation.

　　The rich theoretical and organizational experience of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) is an invaluable treasure trove for the Chinese Communists, from which they draw strength and knowledge to fight for national independence and for the democratic victory of China. Mao Zedong once said: "The All-Union Communist Party is our best teacher." Comrade Stalin's profound scientific analysis of the nature, characteristics, and conditions for the victory of the Chinese anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolution illuminated the path for the Chinese people to freedom—the path of struggle under the leadership of the working class and under the banner of internationalism. Marxist-Leninist theory has become the tried and tested weapon in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party in the struggle for a democratic New China.

　　The Soviet Union's defeat of Hitler's Germany and the decisive defeat of militarist Japan ensured new and extremely favorable conditions for the further development of the Chinese people's national liberation struggle. As a result of the Soviet Union's victory in the Great Patriotic War, the imperialist camp was weakened, and the world's democratic forces were strengthened. This contained the forces of world reaction, making it easier for the Chinese people to liberate themselves.

　　In referring to the decisive significance of these factors, Mao Zedong wrote: "If there were no existence of the Soviet Union, if there were no victory in the anti-fascist Second World War, if Japanese imperialism had not been overthrown, if there were no emergence of the new democratic countries... then the international reactionary forces piled on our heads would certainly be many times greater than they are now. Under such circumstances, could we have won? Obviously not."

　　In the post-war period, the Soviet government has consistently upheld the Chinese people's right to independently solve their domestic problems. With the help of Kuomintang traitors, American imperialists attempted to crush the democratic movement in China and turn China into its unentitled colony. In order to crush the people's liberation movement, the United States spent tens of billions of dollars, sent American troops, supplied the Kuomintang with weapons, and in fact carried out direct intervention in China.

　　The Soviet government has consistently exposed the activities of the imperialists who are hostile to the Chinese people and insisted that the United States stop interfering in China's internal affairs and withdraw American troops stationed in China.

　　The Chinese people cherish the sincere and selfless friendship of the Soviet Union. Relying on the support of the camp of peace and democracy, the Chinese Communist Party led its country to a great victory. Relying on this powerful support, the People's Republic of China will achieve new and brilliant victories. On October 1st of this year, Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, sent the declaration of the Chinese Central People's Government and a proposal to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China to the Soviet government. On October 2nd of this year, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Gromyko, on behalf of the Soviet government, announced the reply of the Soviet government, stating: "Due to the consistent desire to establish truly friendly relations with the Chinese people, and convinced that the Chinese Central People's Government is the representative of the will of the vast majority of the Chinese people, the Soviet government hereby notifies Your Excellency that the Soviet government has decided to establish diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, and to mutually send ambassadors."

　　The establishment of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China will further develop the friendship between the Soviet and Chinese peoples. The liberated Chinese people, represented by their People's Government, have appeared on the world stage, fully and freely expressing their will to uphold peace and democracy.

　　The Soviet people warmly congratulate the great victory of the Chinese people and sincerely rejoice in their liberation. The Soviet people are convinced that this joy is also shared by all true friends of world peace and democracy.

　　May the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples be further strengthened!
　　May the People's Republic of China last and grow stronger!

### 中国人民的伟大胜利

　　中国人民的伟大胜利
    【新华社北京七日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：十月六日，消息报发表题为“中国人民的伟大胜利”的社论，全文如下：
    四亿七千五百万的伟大的中国人民已在反对国内反动派和国际帝国主义的联合力量的斗争中，获得了具有历史意义的胜利。他们粉碎了美国帝国主义想尽方法加以支持的、反民族的叛逆的国民党集团底力量。集聚在人民政治协商会议中的中国人民的代表们，在十月一日宣告中华人民共和国的成立，选出了以中国共产党领袖毛泽东为首的中央人民政府。
    在共产党领导下，中国人民有史以来第一次把政权掌握在自己手里，靠着强有力的社会主义和民主阵营的支持，已开始去解决一世纪以来呻吟于外国贪欲者的铁蹄下的祖国底命运。这一伟大的国家已在英雄的解放战争中赢得了民族独立，现在，走向繁荣的道路、走向独立发展的道路已为中国打开了。推翻了背叛民族的、封建压迫和殖民剥削的腐朽的国民党集团，中国人民正为人民民主的国家奠下了基石。
    这个国家由工人阶级领导，以工农联盟为基础，并团结一切民主阶级和中国一切少数民族。
    人民解放军解放了敌人占据的国土。华北和华中已经解放了。华南相当大的部分已经解放，而且现在人民共和国的军队正逼近广州——被击败的国民党残余还继续盘踞的唯一大港。
    实行着使革命战争胜利完成这一重大的任务，中国共产党在已解放的土地上组织人民和平的建设性的努力。巨大的国家底生活正依照民主的方针而革新及重建。东北与华北已实行了土地改革。一亿以上的无地和贫苦的农民，业已分得从地主与民族叛徒那儿没收过来的土地。从国民党反动集团以及与外国资本有密切关系的中国官僚资产阶级那里没收过来的工业和农业企业业已组成了国营经济的部分；国家开始实行了提高人民物质与文化水平的纲领。革命的创造性的工作正在全国如火如荼地进行，鼓舞着并吸引着越来越多的群众去参加富有历史意义的活动。目前在中国发生的伟大事件，再度说明了斯大林同志眼光的深邃正确。远在一九二五年，他就说过：“在中国，革命运动的力量是巨大的。它们还没有充分表现出来。但它们将来会的。看不见这些力量以及不给它们以应有的估计的东方和西方的统治者们，将要因此吃苦头……这里，真理与正义是完全在中国革命一方面的。这就是为什么我们现在和将来都同情中国革命的缘故，这个革命正在进行着从帝国主义桎梏下解放中国人民以及统一中国为一个国家的斗争。谁在现在和将来不计算到这一力量，谁就一定失败。”
    引起中华人民共和国的建立的中国人民的划时代的胜利，表明了国民党反动集团叛逆的反民族的阴谋以及美国的帝国主义计划的完全破产。二十二年以来，澈头澈尾反动的蒋介石及其所领导的集团，曾轮番出卖中国人民给英国帝国主义者、德国法西斯、日本军国主义者和美国帝国主义者。在国际反动派的帮助下，民族利益的叛卖者意图在中国维持腐朽透顶的封建地主制度，维持剥削阶级的特权。国民党人顺从地充当外国在中国的走狗。执行着其美国主子的命令，他们特别狂热地参加了战争贩子的高声叫嚣。国民党反动分子按照其美国主子的命令，企图用一切可能的方法去窒息民主力量，扼住人民的颈项，并确保美国帝国主义有可能对中国实行殖民剥削，把中国变成在远东实现世界反动派底军事侵略计划的桥头堡垒。
    但是，帝国主义者及其国民党奴才底这一切背理的打算都计算错了。中国共产党领导下的中国人民，在为其祖国的自由和荣誉而进行的顽强斗争中，挫败了世界反动派的一切图谋，他们不容许中国仍然被美国利用。帝国主义的殖民制度已在其最重要环节之一上被打碎了。斯大林同志的预言已成事实。许多年前，斯大林同志指出：“中国的反帝国主义斗争，必须具有广大的群众性和显著的民族性，且必须逐步加深已达到与帝国主义进行猛烈的斗争，并动摇全世界帝国主义的基础”。摆脱了帝国主义和国内反动派的桎梏后，中国已跻身于拥护和平、民主和社会主义这一事业的国家的行列之中。中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领第十一条写道：“中华人民共和国联合世界上一切爱好和平、自由的国家和人民，首先是联合苏联、各人民民主国家和被压迫民族，站在国际和平民主阵营方面，共同反对帝国主义侵略，以保障世界的持久和平”。
    人民的新中国的具有历史意义的胜利，增强了以强大的苏联为首的和平、民主与社会主义阵营的力量，并大大地削弱了帝国主义阵营的力量。
    中国人民与苏联人民的友谊，已在深厚而坚固的基础上繁荣滋长。一切国家被压迫的群众把伟大的十月社会主义革命视为是他们解放的保证。十月革命不但动摇了帝国主义的统治中心，而且也打击了帝国主义的腹地，正如斯大林所说：“破坏了帝国主义在殖民地与附属国的统治”。东方被压迫民族的人民认为苏联是在民族平等与合作的原则上建立其生活的唯一的国家。经验告诉他们：苏联政府是世界上始终维护全世界大国与小国、殖民地与附属国的统一与独立、自由与主权的唯一政府。东方被压迫民族的人民曾经把苏联当作摆脱帝国主义的令人鼓舞的榜样，而且现在也仍然如此。
    苏联人民划时代的成就鼓舞了中国的劳苦大众去反对帝国主义和封建压迫，教会他们在其有历史意义的解放事业中团结在中国共产党——中国人民真正的领导者——的周围。
    联共（布）党丰富的理论经验和组织经验，是中国共产党人的无价宝库，他们从其中吸取力量与知识，去为民族独立、为中国的民主胜利而斗争。毛泽东曾说过：“联共就是我们的最好的先生”。斯大林同志对中国反帝反封建革命的性质、特征与胜利的条件的深刻的科学分析，照亮了中国人民走向自由的道路——在工人阶级的领导和国际主义的旗帜之下斗争的道路。马列主义的理论，成了为民主新中国而斗争的中国共产党手中百试百验的武器。
    苏联打垮了希特勒德国、使军国主义日本遭到决定性的失败，从而保证了中国人民民族解放斗争进一步发展的新的非常有利的条件。苏联在伟大爱国战争中取得胜利的结果，帝国主义阵营被削弱了，世界民主力量壮大了，增强了。这牵制了世界反动派的力量，使中国人民较容易解放自己。
    在谈到这些因素的决定意义时，毛泽东写道：“假如没有苏联的存在，假如没有反法西斯的第二次世界大战的胜利，假如没有打倒日本帝国主义，假如没有各新民主国家的出现……那么，堆在我们头上的国际反动势力必定比现在不知要大多少倍，在这样情形下，我们能够胜利么？显然是不能的。”
    在战后时期，苏联政府始终不渝地维护中国人民独立解决他们国内问题的权利。美帝国主义者在国民党卖国贼的帮助下，企图打垮中国的民主运动并将中国变为它的无权利的殖民地。为了打垮人民的解放运动，美国花了数十亿美元，派了美国军队，供给国民党武器，在中国实际上进行直接干涉。
    苏联政府始终不渝地揭露帝国主义者这种敌视中国人民的活动，并坚持美国停止干涉中国内政，撤退驻华美军。
    中国人民极为珍贵苏联的真诚无私的友谊。依靠着和平与民主阵营的支持，中国共产党领导其国家走到伟大的胜利。依靠着这种有力的支持，中华人民共和国将达到新的辉煌的胜利。今年十月一日，中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部长周恩来将中国中央人民政府的宣言及与中华人民共和国建立外交关系的建议送达苏联政府。今年十月二日，外交部副部长葛罗米柯代表苏联政府宣布苏联政府的复文，内称：苏联政府“由于力求与中国人民建立真正友好关系的始终不渝的意愿，并确信中国中央人民政府是绝大多数中国人民意志的代表者，故特通知阁下：苏联政府决定建立苏联与中华人民共和国之间的外交关系，并互派大使”。
    苏联与中华人民共和国间的外交关系的建立，将使苏中两国人民的友谊进一步发展。获得解放的中国人民为他们的人民政府所代表着，已经出现在世界舞台上，充分而自由地表示了他们拥护和平与民主的意志。
    苏联人民热烈地祝贺中国人民的伟大胜利，并为他们的解放而真诚地欢欣鼓舞。苏联人民深信，这一欢乐也是世界和平与民主的一切真正友人所共有的。
    愿中苏人民的友谊更加增强！
    愿中华人民共和国长存和增强！
