　　Beijing's Judicial Work
  City Government Information Office
  The Beijing People's Court was officially established on March 18th. Since its establishment, under the leadership of the Military Control Commission and the Municipal Government, and in close cooperation with the Disciplinary Corps, the Public Security Bureau, various district offices, and the broad masses of citizens, it has been responsible for suppressing counter-revolutionary activities and protecting state property and the lives and property of the people. In the past six months, in terms of establishing revolutionary order, approximately 1,650 criminals, including spies, despots, puppet Baojia chiefs, scattered soldiers, and thieves, have been dealt with. In stabilizing finance, the People's Court, the Public Security Bureau, the Disciplinary Corps, and the People's Bank jointly established a financial team, handling 2,759 cases of buying and selling gold and silver, silver dollars, foreign currency, and manufacturing counterfeit tickets, confiscating and devaluating 1,598 taels of gold, 4,441 taels of silver, and 38,452 silver dollars. These two types of cases have gradually decreased since June and July. In resolving mass disputes, from the takeover of the Kuomintang reactionary pseudo-Beiping District Court on February 5th to the end of August, a total of 4,174 civil cases and 7,362 criminal cases were received, with 2,167 civil cases and 6,210 criminal cases concluded. Among the criminal cases received, disturbing finance (3,831 cases), theft (1,492 cases), and opium (596 cases) were the most numerous, while among the civil cases received, housing (1,522 cases), debt (952 cases), and marriage (516 cases) were the most numerous. After May, criminal cases gradually decreased, while civil cases gradually increased.
  The People's Court was established on the basis of crushing the Kuomintang reactionary pseudo-judicial organs. The adjudication committee of the People's Court is led directly by the president of the court, who also serves as the presiding judge, and is collectively responsible to the people. In adjudication work, it is forbidden to extort confessions, use torture or disguised torture, emphasizing evidence over confessions, emphasizing on-the-spot investigation and research and soliciting the opinions of the masses rather than relying solely on courtroom debates, and opposing closed-door trials. In the past, when filing criminal lawsuits, the parties could not meet with the judges on the same day. The People's Court established a criminal case reception duty court, which can resolve cases that can be tried immediately, or, after preliminary review, continue to handle them according to their importance and urgency. In the past, people were often extorted and scolded for not being literate or understanding the pseudo-law, but the People's Court provides various assistance to the masses through the writing service and the inquiry office, without charging any fees. By the end of August, 1,180 cases had been assisted by the writing service (not including those urging cases), and the inquiry office had received 2,570 inquiries. At the same time, in order to proactively educate the masses and reduce crime, typical cases are publicized through announcements, newspapers, mass meetings, and other forms to expand the effectiveness of judicial work. The bailiffs and process servers of the pseudo-court were corrupt and extorted money. After the establishment of the People's Court, except for the four who were honest and allowed to be on probation, all were dismissed, and they were replaced by a group of veteran soldiers transferred from the old liberated areas and a group of workers, who were organized and trained to form an execution platoon. Like ordinary revolutionary cadres, these executors are not only honest and self-disciplined, but also act as good propagandists of the policies of the People's Government whenever the parties concerned ask them to take a car, smoke, eat, or give them gifts according to old habits. In addition, the People's Court has also set up circuit trial groups to facilitate litigation for suburban citizens; and guides the work of the mediation sections in urban and rural areas through regular inspections and telephone contacts.
  The People's Court not only shattered the old form in its organizational structure, but more importantly, it has thoroughly abolished the anti-people Six Codes. The basis for the People's Court to handle cases is the New Democratic policies and various programs, laws, announcements, resolutions, and regulations issued by the People's Government and the People's Liberation Army. The punishment for criminal offenses is based on the severity of the harm to the New Democratic society and the interests of the people. Criminals who infringe upon the interests of the New Democratic state and the broad masses of the people, that is, those who endanger collective security and public interests, such as war criminals, spies, despots, murderers, and those who damage the national economic institutions or property related to the national economy and the people's livelihood, shall be severely punished. As for encroachment, injury, and ordinary damage to individual interests, penalties shall be imposed according to the severity of the circumstances. That is to say, the general approach to crime is to educate and reform, rather than to impose severe penalties. The handling of civil cases is based on the principle of taking care of the greatest interests of the greatest number of people. For example, the handling of economic issues is based on the New Democratic economic policy. The People's Government's civil law protects all legitimate private property, not only the private property of workers and all small property owners, but also all private capitalist economies that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, so that they can develop, and of course, more importantly, protect all public property. In dealing with kinship issues, such as marriage issues, the marriage policy of the People's Government is freedom of marriage and monogamy, both for marriage and divorce.
  The punishment of criminals by the People's Court is not aimed at revenge, damaging personality, or causing physical pain, but at education and reform. In order to encourage criminals to correct their mistakes and do good, the People's Court has tried the use of indeterminate sentences (from a few years and a few months to a few years and a few months). Those who perform well during the execution of their sentences can be granted early parole or reduction of their remaining sentence. At present, the detention center implements a progressive and reasonable management system, which is not simply about guarding, but achieves the purpose of understanding and education through study and labor. Small thieves and opium offenders who have been sentenced but have not yet been sent to prison, as well as offenders with sentences of less than one year, are allowed to participate in labor inside and outside the prison, so that they gradually change their new ideological awareness and resolve to start a new life.
  In judicial work, there have been some detours in the past six months, and there are still many shortcomings. For example, after liberation, the People's Court treated despots and robbers too leniently, and failed to combine leniency and suppression well. Only after the All-Circles Representatives Conference did we begin to pay attention to this issue. As another example, individual cadres in the detention center did not understand the policy, and there were incidents of hanging and beating prisoners, which were corrected after being discovered by the leadership, and administrative penalties were given. Individual cadres still do not have a calm enough and humble enough view of the issues, and sometimes the democratic style of adjudication is still lacking, failing to allow the parties to state their opinions related to the case as much as possible. The main shortcomings are: due to the lack of a systematic codified law, cadres lack urban knowledge, and lack experience in managing cities, cases cannot be handled in a timely manner, and by the end of August, there were as many as 3,148 pending cases. The organizational structure and all systems are being explored and created from scratch. For example, the combination and connection between adjudication work, detention work, and execution, as well as the methods and procedures in the execution process, have not been well handled and arranged.
  Strengthening the people's judicial work and strengthening the people's courts is one of the important links in implementing the people's democratic dictatorship. Generally speaking, Beijing's judicial work has been successful in the past six months. All shortcomings are being overcome and can be overcome. In the future, under the leadership of the People's Government and the Supreme People's Court, the Beijing People's Court should be able to complete its task of continuing to suppress counter-revolutionaries, establishing and consolidating revolutionary order, and safeguarding the long-term interests of the broad masses of the people.

　　北京市的司法工作
  市府新闻处
  北京市人民法院正式成立于三月十八日。成立以后即在军管会和市政府的领导之下，与纠察总队、公安局、各区公所及广大市民密切配合，担负起镇压反革命活动，保护国家财富与人民生命财产的责任。半年来，在建立革命秩序方面，已处理的特务、恶霸、伪保甲长、散兵游勇、窃盗等罪犯共约一、六五○名。在稳定金融方面，人民法院和公安局、纠察总队、人民银行联合成立了金融组，处理了买卖金银、银元、外币及制造假票等案件共二、七五九件，没收及贬价金一、五九八两，银四、四四一两，银元三八、四五二枚。这两类案件自六、七月份以来，已渐形减少。在解决群众纠纷方面，自二月五日接管伪北平地方法院至八月底止，共收民事案四、一七四件，刑事案七、三六二件，已结民事案二、一六七件，刑事案六、二一○件。刑事收案中以扰乱金融（三、八三一件）、窃盗（一、四九二件）和烟毒（五九六件）为多，民事收案中则以房屋（一、五二二件）、债务（九五二件）和婚姻（五一六件）为多。五月以后，刑事案件渐减，民事案件逐渐增加。
  人民法院是在粉碎了国民党反动派伪司法机构的基础上建立起来的。人民法院的审判委员会由法院院长兼审判长，直接领导审判工作，集体对人民负责。在审判工作中禁止逼供、刑讯或变相刑讯，重证据而不重口供，重实地调查研究、征求群众意见而不仅以当庭辩论为根据，反对关门判案。过去打刑事官司，当事人当天不能与审判员见面，人民法院设立了刑事收案值日庭，能当时解审的马上解决，否则经过初步审理后，分别轻重缓急继续处理。过去打官司，人们因为不识字或者不懂伪法，也要常常受到敲诈斥骂，人民法院则以代书处和问事处为群众解决各种困难，不收任何费用。到八月底止，有一、一八○件案件得到代书处的帮助（催案的尚未计在内），问事处接受的询问有二五七○件。同时为了主动地教育群众减少犯罪，又将典型案件通过布告、报纸、群众大会等形式进行宣传，扩大司法工作的效果。伪法院的法警执达员贪污敲诈，人民法院成立后，除对四个作风老实的准予试用以外，一律遣散，代替他们的是从老解放区调来一批荣军同志和一部工友，加以编组训练，组成的执行排。正如一般革命干部一样，这些执行员们不但廉洁自守，每遇当事人按照旧习惯请他们坐车、吸烟、吃饭，给他们送礼的时候，他们还都作了人民政府政策的很好的宣传员。此外，人民法院还设立了巡回审判组以便利郊区市民的诉讼；并以定期视察和电话联系的方式指导城乡各区调解科的工作。
  人民法院不但在组织机构上打碎了旧的形式，更重要的是已经彻底地废除了反人民的六法全书。人民法院处理案件的依据是新民主主义的政策与人民政府和人民解放军已发布的各种纲领、法令、布告、决议、条例等。刑事犯罪的处罪以危害新民主主义社会和人民利益的严重与否为科刑的标准，凡侵害新民主主义国家及广大人民利益，即危害集体安全与公共利益的罪犯，如战犯、奸特、恶霸、杀人犯及破坏国家经济机构或与国计民生有关的财产的罪犯，都要处以重刑。至于侵占、伤害及普通损害个人利益的，则按情节轻重，分别予以惩罚。这就是说，对一般犯罪是采取教育改造的方针，而不是采取严刑重罚的方针。处理民事案件则以照顾最大多数人的最大利益为原则。譬如处理经济问题是根据新民主主义的经济政策。人民政府的民法是保护一切正当的私有财产，不仅保护劳动者及其一切小有产者的私有财产，而且保护一切有益于国计民生的私人资本主义经济，使其能够发展，当然更重要的是保护一切公共财产。处理亲属问题，如婚姻问题，人民政府的婚姻政策是婚姻自主与一夫一妻制，结婚离婚都是如此。
  人民法院对刑事犯的惩罚，不是以报复毁损人格及使身体痛苦为目的，而是以教育改造为目的。为了鼓励犯人早日改过迁善，人民法院试用了活期徒刑（几年几个月至几年几个月），在执行中表现好的，都可以提前假释或减少残余刑期。目前看守所实行进步的合理管理制度，不是单纯的看管，而是通过学习劳动，达到了解教育的目的。对已决而未及送监的小偷与烟犯及刑期在一年以下的犯人都允许其在所内所外参加劳动，使其逐渐改变新生的思想意识，立志重新做人。
  在司法工作上，半年以来是走过一些弯路的，而且现在也还存在着不少缺点。譬如在解放以后，人民法院对恶霸及抢匪处理过于宽大，没能把宽大与镇压很好地结合起来。在各界代表会议以后，才开始注意到这个问题。再如看守所个别干部不了解政策，曾经发生过吊打犯人的事情，经领导上发觉后已予纠正，并且给予行政上的处分。个别干部对问题的看法还不够冷静，不够虚心，有时审判上的民主作风还差，没有作到让当事人尽量陈述与案情有关的意见的程度。主要的缺点是：由于还没有一套系统的成文法，干部城市知识不够，管理城市经验缺乏，以致案件不能及时处理，到八月底止，积案竟达三、一四八件。组织机构与一切制度都是摸索草创，如审判工作与看守工作及执行间的结合和联系，执行过程中的方式方法与程序等，都未能作到很好的处理与安排等。
  加强人民的司法工作，强化人民的法庭，是实行人民民主专政重要的环节之一。半年来北京市的司法工作一般说来是有成绩的，一切缺点都是在克服当中，而且是可能克服的。今后，北京市人民法院在人民政府和最高人民法院的领导之下，当可完成其继续镇压反革命建立与巩固革命秩序、维护广大人民长远利益的任务。
