Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 30th: The full text of the Manifesto of the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is as follows:

Fellow countrymen:

　　The First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has victoriously completed its tasks.

　　This conference included representatives of all democratic parties, people's organizations, the People's Liberation Army, all regions, all ethnic groups, overseas Chinese, and other patriotic democratic elements in China, representing the will of the people of the whole country and demonstrating the unprecedented great unity of the people of the whole country.

　　This great unity of the people of the whole country was achieved by the Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, after a long period of heroic struggle and defeating the Kuomintang reactionary government of Chiang Kai-shek, aided by American imperialism. For more than a hundred years, the advanced elements of the Chinese people, outstanding among whom was Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the great revolutionary who led the Revolution of 1911, have led the broad masses of the people in continuous struggles to overthrow the oppression of imperialism and the Chinese reactionary government. They persevered, undaunted by setbacks, and now have finally achieved their goal. As we hold our meeting, the Chinese people have defeated their enemies, changed the face of China, and established the People's Republic of China. Our 475 million Chinese people are now standing up, and the future of our nation is infinitely bright.

　　Under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, the leader of the people, our conference, with one heart and one mind, in accordance with the principles of New Democracy, formulated the Organic Law of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Organic Law of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, and the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. It decided that the capital of the People's Republic of China would be Beijing, determined that the national flag of the People's Republic of China would be the Five-Star Red Flag, adopted the March of the Volunteers as the current national anthem, decided that the chronology of the People's Republic of China would adopt the world's common era, elected the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and elected the Central People's Government Committee of the People's Republic of China. From this point on, Chinese history has opened a new era.

　　Fellow countrymen, the People's Republic of China has now been proclaimed, and the Chinese people already have their own central government. This government will implement the people's democratic dictatorship throughout China in accordance with the Common Program. It will command the People's Liberation Army to carry the revolutionary war to the end, eliminate the remaining enemy forces, liberate the entire national territory, and complete the great cause of unifying China. It will lead the people of the whole country to overcome all difficulties, carry out large-scale economic construction and cultural construction, eliminate the poverty and ignorance left over from the old China, and gradually improve the material and cultural life of the people. It will protect the interests of the people and suppress all counter-revolutionary elements' conspiracies. It will strengthen the people's army, navy, and air force, consolidate national defense, safeguard territorial sovereignty and integrity, and oppose the aggression of any imperialist country. It will unite with all countries, nations, and people who love peace and freedom, especially the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries, as its allies, to jointly oppose the imperialists' conspiracy to provoke war and strive for lasting world peace.

　　Fellow countrymen, we should further organize ourselves. We should organize the vast majority of people in China into political, military, economic, cultural, and other organizations, overcome the state of disorganization and disunity of the old China, and use the collective strength of the great masses of the people to support the People's Government and the People's Liberation Army, and build a new China that is independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, prosperous, and strong.

　　Eternal glory to the people's heroes who sacrificed themselves for the people's liberation war and the people's revolution!

　　Long live the great unity of the Chinese people

    在人民领袖毛泽东主席领导之下，我们的会议齐心一志，按照新民主主义的原则，制定了中国人民政治协商会议组织法，制定了中华人民共和国中央人民政府组织法，制定了中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领，决定了中华人民共和国定都于北京，制定了中华人民共和国的国旗为五星红旗，采用了义勇军进行曲为现时的国歌，决定了中华人民共和国的纪年采用世界公元，选举了中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会，选举了中华人民共和国中央人民政府委员会。中国的历史，从此开辟了一个新的时代。
    全国同胞们，中华人民共和国现已宣告成立，中国人民业已有了自己的中央政府。这个政府将遵照共同纲领在全中国境内实施人民民主专政。它将指挥人民解放军将革命战争进行到底，消灭残余敌军，解放全国领土，完成统一中国的伟大事业。它将领导全国人民克服一切困难，进行大规模的经济建设和文化建设，扫除旧中国所留下来的贫困和愚昧，逐步地改善人民的物质生活和提高人民的文化生活。它将保卫人民的利益，镇压一切反革命分子的阴谋活动。它将加强人民的陆海空军，巩固国防，保卫领土主权完整，反对任何帝国主义国家的侵略。它将联合一切爱好和平自由的国家、民族和人民，首先是联合苏联和各新民主国家，以为自己的盟友，共同反对帝国主义者挑拨战争的阴谋，争取世界的持久和平。
    全国同胞们，我们应当进一步组织起来。我们应当将全中国绝大多数人组织在政治、军事、经济、文化及其他各种组织里，克服旧中国散漫无组织的状态，用伟大的人民群众的集体力量，拥护人民政府和人民解放军，建设独立民主和平统一富强的新中国。
