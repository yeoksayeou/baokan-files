Xinhua News Agency, South China Front, 28th: The People's Liberation Army, on its way from southern Jiangxi to Guangdong, has received an incredibly warm welcome from the people along the way. Local areas have universally organized committees to welcome and support the front, setting up grain stations, firewood and grass stations, tea stalls, and information offices along the army's southern advance route to ensure the army's victorious advance and annihilation of the enemy. Their slogan is: "Do a good job of welcoming the army and strive for the early liberation of Guangdong." When a certain unit of the PLA passed through the old revolutionary base areas of Ruijin, Xingguo, and Chongyi counties in southern Jiangxi, the broad masses of the people immediately mobilized and sent their hard-earned and saved grain to the support-the-front committee. Xingguo County alone raised 3 million jin of grain for support. The people of Yishizhen in Chongyi County used bamboo rafts to supply the troops with large quantities of vegetables from forty miles away. In the sparsely populated mountainous areas of the county, the people built simple, large barracks for a company of soldiers every fifty miles to prevent them from sleeping in the open; they also built many "resting pavilions" along the way, equipped with tea. In order to ensure the smooth southern advance of the army, the people of Xingguo repaired 26 bridges overnight. When the PLA advanced into the territory of Wengyuan County in northern Guangdong, the troops passed through 150 miles of territory, and many colorful sheds were erected along the way to welcome the army's southern advance. All day long, there were welcomes and farewells, with gongs and drums beating, a lively scene unprecedented in the county. When the army entered a grain-deficient area in Shixing County and bivouacked, 3,000 farmers from Jiangwei, Songtang and other villages spontaneously organized a transport team and delivered 120,000 jin of grain overnight. In four days, the people of the whole county paid a total of 30,000 dan of grain, 30,000 dan of rice straw, and 60,000 dan of firewood to the support-the-front committee. The people of Xinfeng County spontaneously organized an 8,000-member civilian labor team dedicated to transporting grain and supplies for the PLA and transferring the wounded. The people of the Second District of the county held a mass rally of more than 10,000 people in Matou to welcome the army and support the front, and donated a large number of comfort items. After a unit of the army entered the territory of Conghua County, the people of Lvtian, Liuxi and other towns in the north of the county, regardless of the threats from the Chiang bandits entrenched nearby, enthusiastically built colorful arches and prepared large quantities of firewood, rice, oil, salt and vegetables to wait for the arrival of the PLA. When the PLA launched an attack on the Chiang bandit army in Conghua, they immediately organized a civilian labor team of more than 500 people to accompany the army and serve as guides. When a certain unit advanced towards Guangzhou and passed through a valley near Chiji in Hua County, the miners of the Yuehan Road cement factory and mine also jumped up excitedly, carrying buckets of boiled tea down the mountain to entertain their own troops. On the 100-mile journey from Hua County to Guangzhou, the common people endlessly carried tea and food, gathered on both sides of the road, welcomed the southern advancing army, and excitedly told the soldiers how many miles were left to Guangzhou.

　　保证大军胜利南进赣粤人民热烈支援
    【新华社华南前线二十八日电】人民解放军自赣南向广东进军途中，受到沿途人民无比热情的欢迎。各地普遍组织了迎军支援前线委员会，于大军南进途中遍设粮站、柴草站、茶水亭、问事处等机构，保证大军胜利进军歼灭敌人。他们的口号是：“作好迎接大军工作，争取广东早日解放。”当解放军南进某部道经赣南二十年前老苏区瑞金、兴国和崇义等县时，广大人民立即动员起来，把自己辛苦节省的粮食送到支前委员会去，仅兴国一县即筹集支前粮食三百万斤。崇义县一市镇人民自四十里外用竹筏将蔬菜大批供应部队。在该县人烟稀少的山地中，人民每隔五十里即为部队建修可容一连人的简单的大营房，以免士兵露宿野外；还在沿途盖了许多“歇足亭”，设备茶水。兴国人民为保证大军顺利南进，曾连夜修好桥梁二十六座。当解放军进抵粤北翁源县境时，部队经过一百五十里的地方，沿途扎了许多欢迎大军南下的彩棚。整日欢迎欢送，锣鼓喧天，热闹情形为该县前所未有。大军进入始兴县某缺粮地区宿营时，当地江尾、松塘等乡三千农民自动组织了运输队，一夜送到粮食十二万斤。全县人民在四天中前后向支前委员会缴纳粮食达三万担，稻草三万担，柴六万担。新丰县全县人民自动组织了一个八千人的民工队，专为解放军运输粮食、辎重和转送伤员。该县二区人民在马头举行万人以上的迎军支前大游行，并捐出大批慰劳品。大军一部进入从化县境后，县北吕田、流溪等镇人民不顾盘据附近的蒋匪威胁，踊跃建立彩牌，并准备了大批柴、米、油、盐和蔬菜，等待解放军到来。当解放军向从化蒋匪军进击时，他们立即组织了五百多人的民工队随军出征，为部队作向导工作。某部向广州挺进经过花县赤汲附近山谷时，粤汉路洋灰厂矿山的矿工们也都兴奋得跳起来，把烧好的茶水一桶桶地抬下山来招待自己的队伍。从花县到广州一百里途中，老百姓络绎不绝地抬着茶水、食物，聚集公路两旁，迎接南进大军，并兴奋地告诉战士们到广州还有多少里路。
