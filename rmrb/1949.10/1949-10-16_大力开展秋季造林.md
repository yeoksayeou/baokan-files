This year's spring and rainy season afforestation has exceeded the annual afforestation plan figures due to the strong organization and leadership in various regions. Autumn afforestation has better conditions and a higher survival rate than spring and rainy season afforestation. It is hoped that all regions will make every effort to carry it out, implement afforestation in three seasons a year, and double the afforestation achievements this year.

　　大力开展秋季造林
    农业部
    今年春季和雨季的造林，由于各地的大力组织领导，已超了全年的造林计划数字。秋季造林较之春季、雨季造林，有更好的条件，成活率也较高，望各地尽力开展，贯彻一年三季造林，把今年的造林成绩加倍扩大。
