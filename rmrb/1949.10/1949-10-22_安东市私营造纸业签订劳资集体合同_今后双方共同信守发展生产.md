　　Andong Private Paper Industry Signs Labor-Management Collective Contract
　　Both Parties Will Abide by It and Jointly Uphold Production Development in the Future
　　[Report from this newspaper] After a month and a half of mobilization, deliberation, education, democratic consultation, and repeated discussions, the labor-management collective contract between the Andong Private Paper Industry Union and the Trade Association, on which labor and management finally reached a consensus, was solemnly signed at the Federation of Industry and Commerce auditorium on the morning of October 6. Representatives from the CPC Andong Municipal Committee, the Municipal Government, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Municipal Labor Bureau, and the Municipal Administration of Industry and Commerce, as well as all employees of the paper industry, managers of various factories, and representatives from other industrial unions and trade associations, totaling more than 200 people, attended. This is the first labor-management collective contract signed in Andong.
　　At the beginning of the meeting, Chairman Ru Minglun reported on the basis and process of formulating the collective contract. He said: During the process of formulating the contract, it is particularly worth mentioning that in order to celebrate the birth of the People's Republic of China and welcome the economic construction of the new China, the worker comrades voluntarily made significant concessions on holidays and labor protection benefits, which led to the smooth achievement of the final agreement. After the chairman read the original text of the collective contract, representatives from both labor and management successively signed the contract.
　　Li Cheng, Director of the Andong Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau, announced on the spot that the contract was approved and explained the reasons for making textual revisions to certain clauses in the contract, stating that it would be legally effective for one year from the date of approval. Because the contract represents the common will of both labor and management, both parties must jointly abide by and comply with it, and the Labor Bureau will supervise its implementation and handle labor-management disputes in accordance with the contract. He hoped that workers would actively produce, take care of machinery, save raw materials, increase social wealth, and build their own country; and that capitalists would operate with peace of mind, accumulate funds, actively expand production, adopt various forms to promote democracy, rely on workers, and implement a piece-rate bonus system to promote workers' enthusiasm for production.
　　In his speech, Lu Qien, Secretary of the CPC Andong Municipal Committee, pointed out: First, private enterprises currently have some misconceptions about trade unions, which have been transformed through the signing of contracts, recognizing that trade unions are the best organizations for educating and organizing workers, actively promoting production, implementing policies, and protecting workers' welfare. Second, there are very few Party members in private enterprises, and Party building is currently underway. Party members in private enterprises resolutely implement the Party's policies and serve as role models for workers in production, and factories should welcome them. He also emphasized that private enterprises should currently do two things: one is to democratize factory management, learn from state-owned factories, rely on workers to improve production, and learn from the Hechang Paper Mill's method of holding production meetings and absorbing workers' participation to improve production; and the second is to implement a piece-rate wage and bonus system, opposing the tendency of egalitarianism in wages. Finally, he hoped that representatives of industrial unions and trade associations in Andong would formulate specific contracts based on the production and operation of their respective industries to resolve existing labor-management relations issues in various industries. Finally, worker representatives Fang Guangyu and Liu Liangshan spoke, stating that the worker brothers would definitely implement the provisions of the contract, actively produce, and strive to build a new Andong. Capitalist representative Xu Kuiyuan also expressed his willingness to abide by the contract and actively expand production.

　　安东市私营造纸业签订劳资集体合同
  　今后双方共同信守发展生产
    【本报讯】经过一个半月的动员酝酿教育，民主协商，反复讨论，劳资双方终于获得意见一致的安东市私营造纸业工会与同业公会的劳资集体合同，于十月六日上午在工商联合会礼堂，举行隆重的签字典礼，到有中共安东市委、市政府、市职工会、市劳动局、市工商局代表及造纸业全体职工、各厂经理及其他产业工会、同业公会代表二百余人。这是安东市签订的第一个劳资集体合同。
    会议开始，由主席茹明伦报告订立集体合同的根据和经过。他说：在酝酿订立合同过程中，特别值得提出的是工人同志为了庆祝中华人民共和国的诞生，迎接新中国的经济建设，最后自动的在休假日及劳保福利上，作了很大的让步，以致顺利的达到最后协议。主席宣读集体合同原文之后，由劳资双方代表依次在合同上签字。
    安东市人民政府劳动局长李澄同志，当场宣布予以批准，并解释对合同中某些条文作文字上修正的理由，说明从批准之日起，一年内在法律上有效，因为合同是代表劳资双方的共同意志，双方必须共同信守遵行，劳动局将根据合同来监督执行，和处理劳资争议。希望工友们积极生产，爱护机器，节约原料，增加社会财富，建设自己的国家；资方安心经营，积累资金，积极扩大生产，采用各种形式发扬民主，依靠工人，实行超额奖励制，以发扬工人生产积极性。
    在中共安东市委书记吕其恩讲话中指出；一、目前私营企业对工会有些错误的看法，从订立合同中转变了，认识到工会是教育组织工人，积极生产，执行政策和保护工人福利的最好组织。二、私人企业中，党员还很少，目前正进行建党。私人企业中的党员是坚决执行党的政策，在生产上作工人的榜样的，各工厂应该欢迎。他并强调提出目前私营企业应该做两件事情，一是工厂管理民主化，要学习公家工厂，依靠工人改进生产，学习私营和昌造纸厂召开生产会议，吸收工人参加，改进生产的办法。二是实行按件工资，超额奖励制，反对工资上平均主义偏向。最后他希望，安东市各产业工会行业公会代表，根据本行业生产营业情况，具体订立合同，以解决各行业所存在的劳资关系问题。最后工人代表方广裕及刘良山讲话，表示工人弟兄，一定执行合同的规定，积极生产，为建设新安东而努力。资方代表徐魁元也表示愿遵守合同，积极扩大生产。
