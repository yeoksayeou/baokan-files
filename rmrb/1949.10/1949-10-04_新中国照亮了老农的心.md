　　The New China Illuminates the Heart of an Old Farmer

　　Wu Dajin is sixty-two years old this year. He has lived in Longbei Village, District 16 of the Western Suburbs, since he was a child, and has always lived a life of poverty. He witnessed the overthrow of the Great Qing Empire, Yuan Shikai's proclamation of himself as emperor, the warlord battles of Zhang Zuolin and Wu Peifu, the ravages of the Japanese invaders, and the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries. In the village, he experienced the various atrocities of "Shoubei" (garrison commander), "Fangzhang" (local administrator), and even "Baozhang" (ward chief).

　　The People's Republic of China was founded. The old man heard these unfamiliar words, but he felt particularly close to them. Because he compared the current village chief and staff with the former "Shoubei," "Fangzhang," and "Baozhang," and found them to be different.

　　He thought about the past: When the "Empress Dowager Cixi" lived in extravagance and dissipation in the Longevity Hill, the "Shoubei" in the village acted recklessly, and it was the poor farmers who suffered. After the Republic of China, even though they said there was a revolution, weren't the local "Fangzhang" still oppressing the poor farmers in the same way? When the warlords fought, they conscripted people, and it was always the poor farmers who suffered. It goes without saying about when the Japanese were here, they killed whenever they wanted, beat whenever they wanted, and grabbed laborers all day long. He was once grabbed to build an airport in Nanyuan; the Japanese soldiers and officials ate white rice and wheat flour every day, who cared about the lives of the common people? His old wife starved to death four years ago. After the Japanese surrendered, the Kuomintang returned. In those three years, they demanded grain today and soldiers tomorrow. He saw young men hiding in the fields every night. He saw the bully Wu Ziwen raping virtuous women. He saw the son of the poor farmer Che San beaten unreasonably by the Baozhang because his wedding didn't please the Baozhang. He saw the Kuomintang special agent Xi Shouyuan asking this family for grain and that family for money, and calling people "Eighth Route Army" if they didn't give it. He saw American soldiers driving jeeps openly snatching women on the road in Nanyuan. He saw.... All this had angered the old man for decades. Today, when he talks about these past events, his eyes still blaze with fire.

　　Today, liberation has come. He sees the discipline of the People's Liberation Army, he sees the hard work style of the staff, he feels that things have changed, and he himself has changed. When the People's Liberation Army besieged Beijing, he led the way for the PLA several times late at night, and he sent his two sons to carry stretchers. During the spring plowing season, he responded to the government's call and opened up eight mu of wasteland. He organized and led three mutual aid teams. He was also elected as the village head by the farmers. After the summer flood, he mobilized more than a dozen farmers to dig a thirty-zhang-long ditch and build a wooden bridge. During the crop protection season, he walked in the fields day and night. He always attends every village meeting, and once he crossed chest-deep water to attend a meeting. Now he is sixty-two years old, but he is still full of vitality like a young man.

　　The People's Republic of China was founded. The old man said with a solemn mood: "Good, good, our good days are stabilized from now on. I have lived this life, and only this year do I feel that I am not being bullied, that no one is oppressing me. From now on, I must plant crops better, the good days are yet to come...." The New China is embodied in the old man's heart in this way. The New China illuminates him, and also illuminates the hearts of all working people.

　　新中国照亮了老农的心
    吴达金今年六十二岁了，他自小就住在西郊十六区的龙背村，一直过着贫穷的生活。他亲眼看见大清帝国的颠覆，袁世凯的称帝，张作霖、吴佩孚的混战，日寇的蹂躏和国民党反动派的统治。在村里他更经历过“守备”、“方长”，以至“保长”的种种暴行
    中华人民共和国成立了，老汉听了这生疏的字眼，但他却感到分外亲切。因为他就拿现在的村长和工作员来比比，就和以前什么“守备”、“方长”、“保长”不一样。
    他想到了过去：“慈禧太后”在万寿山中穷奢极欲，村中的“守备”胡作非为，受苦受害的都是穷苦农民。民国以后，说是革了命，地方上的“方长”还不是一样欺压的是穷苦农民？军阀打仗的时候，抓人拉夫，受害的也尽是穷苦的农民。日本在的时候更甭提，要杀就杀，爱打就打，整天抓劳工，他就曾给抓到南苑修过飞机场；日本兵和当官差的天天大米白面，老百姓的死活谁管？他的老伴就在四年前饿死的。日本投降，国民党回来了，三年里，今天要粮，明天要兵。他看见年青小伙子天天晚上躲到地里去。他看见恶霸吴子文强奸良家妇女。他看见贫农车三的儿子娶媳妇因不合保长的意，给保长无理毒打。他看见国民党特务郗寿元问这家要粮，向那家要钱，不给就说人是“八路”。他看见南苑的美军驾着吉普车在大路上公开抢走妇女。他看见……。这一切在老汉心中忿怒了几十年，今天他谈着这些往事，眼睛还冒着火。
    今天解放了，他看见人民解放军的军纪，他看见工作人员的艰苦作风，他觉着变了，他自己也变了。当解放军围困北京的时候，他几次在深夜替解放军带路，他打发他的两个儿子去抬担架。春耕时他响应政府的号召，开了八亩荒地。他组织和领导了三个互助小组。他又在农民的拥戴下当了闾长。在夏涝以后，他动员了十多个农民挑了一道三十丈长的水沟，架了一道木板桥。护青的季节他不分日夜地在田里走着。每一次村里开会他一定到，有一次为了来开会，他渡过了没胸的水。现在他六十二岁了，但他还和年青人一样充满了活力。
    中华人民共和国成立了，老汉带着严肃的心情说道：“好，好，我们得到的好日子打这稳住了。我活了这一辈子，打今年才觉着不受气，没人压。打后我得更好地种庄稼，好日子还在后头……。”新中国是这样地体现在老汉的心中。新中国照亮了他，也照亮了所有劳动人民的心。
