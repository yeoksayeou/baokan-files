　　The Common Program Opened Up My Thinking
　　Iron Transport Team  Zhang Jianchao
　　My thinking used to be a bit backward. I always felt that being a revolutionary soldier was a good thing when the Kuomintang reactionaries hadn't been eliminated, but when everything moved towards production and construction in the future, wouldn't we soldiers be idle? I always had this muddled idea. But after studying the military system in the Common Program of the CPPCC, I suddenly understood! Article 22 states: "The People's Republic of China should strengthen the modernization of the army and build an air force and navy to consolidate national defense." Article 24 also states: "In peacetime, the army of the People's Republic of China, on the condition that it does not hinder military tasks, should participate in agricultural and industrial production in a planned way to help the country's construction work." This shows that our soldiers still have huge tasks during the nation-building period. In the past, imperialists plundered and slaughtered the Chinese people on our land. Now our people have turned over and implemented a people's democratic dictatorship. Our victory was achieved by the armed forces led by the Communist Party. From this point of view, if our country wants to have a stable foundation and the people's power to be firmly in hand, it still needs a strong armed force. If there is no strong armed force, all domestic and foreign reactionaries will collude to invade our territory and undermine our construction. We cannot ignore this. As the Common Program says, "Strengthen modernization." Only with a strong armed force can we consolidate the victory of the revolution. Therefore, we must also strengthen our modernization studies, hold the gun tightly, and consolidate our national defense.

　　共同纲领打通了我的思想
    铁车总队  张剑超
    我过去的思想有些落后，总觉得当个革命军人在国民党反动派残余没消灭前是很吃香的，可是将来一切都走向生产建设，那时候我们军人不是没事干吗？总是存在着这样的糊涂想法，但是经过学了政协共同纲领的军事制度后，我豁然开朗了！第二十二条说：“中华人民共和国应加强现代化的陆军，并建设空军和海军，以巩固国防”。第二十四条并说：“中华人民共和国的军队在和平时期，在不防碍军事任务的条件下，应有计划地参加农业和工业的生产，帮助国家的建设工作”。这说明我们军人在建国时期，还有着巨大的任务的。过去，帝国主义者在我们国土上掠夺、屠杀中国人，现在我们人民翻身了，实行民主专政了，而我们的胜利，是由共产党领导的武装打出来的。由此看来，我们国家要想根基稳，人民掌权扎实，仍须有强大的武装力量，假如没有强大的武装力量，一切国内外反动派还会勾结侵犯我们国土，破坏我们建设，我们不能忽视这点。正如共同纲领上所说，“加强现代化”，只有有了强大的武装力量，才能巩固革命的胜利，因此，我们还要加强现代化学习，把枪杆子把紧紧的，巩固我们的国防。
