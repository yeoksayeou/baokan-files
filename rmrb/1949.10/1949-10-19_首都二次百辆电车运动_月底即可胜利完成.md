　　Capital's Second Hundred Tramcar Campaign
  　Will be Successfully Completed by the End of the Month
    [Beijing News] The tram company's second hundred-tramcar campaign is about to be successfully completed. Originally planned to put one hundred tramcars into operation by November 1st, now, thanks to the efforts of the workers, it is expected that one hundred and one tramcars will be put into operation before the end of this month. The company's workers completed the first hundred-tramcar campaign on April 19th to welcome the first "May Day" after liberation. However, due to insufficient vigilance and lax security, special agents set fire to and destroyed fifty-eight tramcars on the night of April 24th. At that time, many workers cried out in grief and were extremely angry, and immediately turned their sorrow and indignation into strength, starting the second hundred-tramcar campaign. With the leadership and financial assistance of the Enterprise Bureau, everyone started repairs, guaranteeing to use eighty-four tramcars to welcome "July 1st" and one hundred tramcars to welcome the October Revolution Day. On May 4th, the foreman of the repair shop held a joint meeting and decided to add more than eighty temporary workers to speed up repairs. Due to the small number of temporary workers who came, there were no riveters, only a few fitters, electricians, and carpenters. It was not until June 1st that all the people were in place. For carpentry alone, the plan was short more than eight hundred workdays (it takes six hundred workdays to build a new tramcar), but the workers went all out, not only completing the plan on time (actually ten days ahead of schedule), but also repairing an old locomotive, so that eighty-five tramcars were put into operation on "July 1st". From July onwards, the original plan was to produce four new tramcars each month, and one hundred tramcars would be completed by November 1st. But now there are only five new tramcars that haven't been painted, and one locomotive is lacking some ironwork. By the 25th of this month, one hundred good tramcars will be completed. In this stage of work, not only was the time advanced by five or six days, but also during the heavy rain in August when materials could not be delivered, the carpenters also dismantled and repaired a trailer and a locomotive, and recently dismantled and repaired another trailer, which is actually equivalent to adding three new tramcars.

　　首都二次百辆电车运动
  　月底即可胜利完成
    【北京讯】电车公司第二次百辆车运动，即将胜利完成。原订十一月一日出车百辆，现在由于工人努力的结果，预计在本月底以前即可出车一百零一辆。按该公司工人为了迎接解放后的第一个“五一”节，曾在四月十九日，完成第一次百辆车运动。但因警惕不够，疏于保卫，竟被特务分子在四月二十四日夜，纵火烧毁了五十八辆。当时许多工人痛哭失声，愤怒万分，并立刻把悲愤变为力量，开始第二次百辆车运动。大家在企业局领导与财力帮助下动手赶修，保证用八十四辆迎接“七一”，用一百辆迎接十月革命节。五月四日，修造厂领班开联席会，议决添临时工人八十余人，以便赶修。由于来的临时工过少，没有一个铆工，只添了几个案工、电工和木工，直到六月一日，才上齐了人。只木工一项，按计划就亏了八百多工（做一辆新车就需六百工），但是工人一鼓作气，不只准时完成了计划（实际上等于提前了十天），而且还多修好一辆老机车，使“七一”出了八十五辆车。从七月份起，原计划每月出新车四辆、到十一月一日，正好完成百辆。但是现在只差五辆新车没油好，一辆机车欠点铁活，至本月二十五日，即可完成百辆好车。这一阶段的工作，不只时间上提前了五、六天，而且在八月下大雨，材料来不到时，木工们还拆修了一辆拖车、一辆机车，最近又拆修了一辆拖车，实际上等于又新增了三辆车。
