　　At the Cadre Meeting of the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee
    Minister Zhang Calls for Studying the CPPCC Documents
    Propaganda Department Instructs the Whole Region to Study
    [From Our Own Correspondent] Zhang Panshi, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, delivered a report to all cadres of the North China Bureau on October 4 concerning the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the establishment of the Central People's Government. He said: People in various places have been singing and dancing in the streets for days, celebrating the establishment of the Central People's Government with joy and excitement. This is because the goal for which the Chinese people have sacrificed and struggled for more than a century has been realized, and it is indeed worthy of enthusiastic celebration. He called on everyone to earnestly study and publicize the various documents of the CPPCC, to turn joy into strength, and to turn resolutions into action. After explaining that the CPPCC is the best form of the Chinese people's democratic united front, Minister Zhang used his personal experience of participating in the conference to illustrate the spirit of people's democracy and the great historical significance of the three major documents. He said that the documents passed by the conference had undergone full consultation and repeated discussions and revisions, some even the punctuation marks were seriously discussed, truly achieving that everyone speaks freely and says everything they know. This true people's democracy is something that the old democratic parliamentary system could never have. He said: The Common Program truly concentrates the wishes of the people of the whole country, and every representative of the conference can find clauses representing their own interests here. This Common Program is the program for all aspects of our work and the action program for building a new China. Minister Zhang finally emphasized: Great construction work has already begun before us. In order to complete this construction task, we must study hard and publicize this historically significant conference to the broad masses, publicize the establishment of our new Central Government, and publicize the meaning represented by our national flag, national anthem, etc., to mobilize the people of the whole country to struggle for the realization of the conference resolutions. Minister Zhang instructed everyone to combine the study and publicity of the CPPCC documents and to strengthen and improve their work with the joyful and inspiring spirit of celebrating the success of the CPPCC.
    Furthermore, in order to implement the resolutions of the CPPCC, the Propaganda Department of the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee issued instructions, calling on all cadres and party members in North China to conduct in-depth study of the various documents and resolutions of the CPPCC, to carry out extensive publicity, and to mobilize millions of people to turn these resolutions into the reality of construction work.
