Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 16th. London dispatch: The Central Committee of the Spanish Communist Party sent a telegram to Chairman Mao Zedong congratulating the founding of the People's Republic of China. The text is as follows:

Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the People's Republic of China:

On the occasion of the founding of the People's Government, we, on behalf of the Spanish Communist Party, extend our sincere congratulations to you and the heroic Chinese Communist Party, to the People's Army and the Chinese people.

The Central Committee of the Spanish Communist Party believes that your legendary victory is a great help to the Spanish people, because, thanks to your struggle and your victory, 475 million Chinese citizens have joined the forces of peace and democracy; because your victory is a powerful contribution to the liberation of the Spanish people from the Franco fascist dictatorship.

Long live the glorious victory of the Chinese people and their army under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party!

Long live the international solidarity of the working class and the people!

Long live peace and world democracy under the leadership of the great Soviet Union and our beloved teacher and leader Stalin!

　　　　　　　　　　　　　Central Committee of the Spanish Communist Party

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 16th. The Sussex District Meeting of the British Communist Party unanimously passed a "Resolution on China" on October 9, congratulating the founding of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China. The resolution stated: The Sussex Conference of the Communist Party wholeheartedly welcomes the establishment of the Chinese People's Democratic Government. It is built on the basis of representatives of the broad masses of people, has the fullest support of the broad laboring peasants and workers, and has the leadership of the Communist Party. It is the greatest historical event since the Russian Revolution of 1917. It marks the end of the corrupt Kuomintang autocracy, the end of imperialist oppression and the brutal exploitation of 450 million people. It has become a most serious failure for the American imperialists. The large amount of weapons and dollar supplies of American imperialism have failed to defeat the democratic people's army led by the Communists. But this meeting warns the organized labor movement: although the imperialists falsely claim "non-interference" as their policy, they will try to support their running dogs to make trouble in China. Therefore, it is extremely important to emphatically demand that the government: 1. Immediately grant legal recognition to the Chinese People's Democratic Government established in Beijing. 2. Immediately negotiate a long-term trade agreement with the government, which is a very beneficial step for the British people. 3. Rapidly withdraw all British troops from Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland. The meeting unanimously agreed to send the resolution to Mao Zedong, Premier Zhou Enlai, and Zhu De to express our congratulations, admiration, and solidarity with the Chinese people. The meeting also unanimously agreed to send the resolution to the government and newspapers.

  　电毛主席致贺
    【新华社布拉格十六日电】伦敦航讯：西班牙共产党中央委员会致电毛泽东主席祝贺中华人民共和国的成立，文如下：
    中华人民共和国主席毛泽东同志：
    值此人民政府成立之际，我们代表西班牙共产党向你和英勇的中国共产党，向人民军与中国人民致恳挚的祝贺。
    西班牙共产党中央委员会认为你们的传奇式的胜利是对西班牙人民的巨大帮助，因为，由于你们的斗争与你们的胜利，四万万七千五百万中国公民已经与和平、民主的力量聚合在一起了；因为你们的胜利是对西班牙人民从佛朗哥法西斯独裁下获得解放的一个有力的贡献。
    在中国共产党领导下的中国人民及其军队的光荣的胜利万岁！
    工人阶级的与人民的国际团结万岁！
    在伟大的苏联与我们敬爱的导师和领袖斯大林领导下的和平与世界民主万岁！
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　西班牙共产党中央委员会
    【新华社布拉格十六日电】英国共产党萨塞克斯区会议十月九日一致通过“关于中国的决议”，祝贺中华人民共和国中央人民政府的成立。该决议称：共产党萨塞克斯会议衷心欢迎中国人民民主政府的成立。它建立在广大各界人民的代表的基础上，拥有广大劳动农民与工人的最充分的支持，有着共产党的领导，它是一九一七年俄国革命以来最伟大的历史事件。它标志着腐化的国民党独裁的结束、帝国主义压迫和对四万万五千万人民的残酷剥削的结束。它成为美国帝国主义者的一个最严重的失败。美国帝国主义的大量武器与美元供应并未能击败共产党人所领导的民主的人民军队。但本会议警告有组织的劳工运动：帝国主义者虽伪称以“不干涉”为其政策，但他们将力图支持他们的走狗在中国捣乱。因此，极为重要的是着重地要求政府：一、立即予在北京建立的中国人民民主政府以法律上的承认。二、立即与该政府谈判长期贸易协定，这是对英国人民极有利的一种步骤。三、迅速撤退香港及中国本土上的一切英军。会上一致同意，将决议送交毛泽东、总理周恩来和朱德，以表示我们对中国人民的祝贺、钦佩和团结一致。本会议并一致同意将决议送交政府及报纸。
