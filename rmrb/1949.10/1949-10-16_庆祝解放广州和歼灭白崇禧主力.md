　　Celebrating the Liberation of Guangzhou and the Annihilation of Bai Chongxi's Main Force
　　In early October, the People's Liberation Army on the Central China Front launched an offensive. In less than two weeks, they annihilated Bai Chongxi's main force and captured Guangzhou, the largest city in South China, which the Kuomintang remnants had once occupied as their center. We extend our respects to the commanders and fighters of the Fourth and Second Field Armies and the South China People's Liberation Army who participated in the liberation of Guangzhou, and to the people of Guangdong and all people's armed forces who assisted the People's Liberation Army in combat.
　　The annihilation of Bai Chongxi's main force in southern Hunan, the rapid liberation of Guangzhou, and the rapid and complete liberation of provinces such as Fujian, Gansu, Qinghai, Suiyuan, Ningxia, and Xinjiang are several major developments in the Chinese war situation over the past two months. The Kuomintang remnants now only have a few southwestern provinces and islands such as Taiwan and Qiongya as their last escape routes, and after the liberation of Guangzhou, the liberation of these places will not take long.
　　The liberation of Guangzhou is of great significance not only militarily but also economically and politically. The liberation of Guangzhou can rapidly restore transportation between South China and the Yangtze River basin, thereby greatly undermining the Kuomintang remnants' naval blockade policy. The liberation of Guangzhou makes the Kuomintang remnants' political position even more ridiculous. No serious political organization, no national government, and no United Nations organization should have diplomatic relations with bandits who have fled to Chongqing, and Taiwan, and who knows where else. There is only one government in China, and that is the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, which has Beijing as its capital. Anyone who continues to recognize the Kuomintang bandit gang "government" and continues to support the "representatives" of this "government" in carrying out criminal activities in the international community is demonstrating their unfriendly attitude towards the great Chinese people.

### 庆祝解放广州和歼灭白崇禧主力

　　庆祝解放广州和歼灭白崇禧主力
    华中前线人民解放军在十月初旬发动攻势，不到两个星期，就歼灭了白崇禧的主力，攻克了国民党残匪所曾据为中心的华南最大都市广州。我们谨向参加解放广州的第四、第二两大野战军及华南人民解放军的指挥员和战斗员致敬，谨向协助人民解放军作战的广东人民及全部人民武装力量致敬。
    白崇禧主力在湖南南部的被歼，广州的迅速解放，和福建、甘肃、青海、绥远、宁夏、新疆等省的迅速全部解放，是两个多月以来中国战局的几个主要发展。国民党残匪现在只有西南数省和台湾、琼崖等海岛作为最后的逃亡去路了，而在广州解放以后，这些地方的解放，也不会要多久的时间了。
    广州的解放不但在军事上，而且在经济上和政治上都有重要的意义。广州解放可以使华南与长江流域的交通迅速恢复，从而大大地打击了国民党残匪的海上封锁政策。广州解放使国民党残匪的政治地位显得更加滑稽。任何郑重的政治组织，任何国家的政府和联合国组织，都不应当再与逃往重庆和台湾和不知什么地方的匪类发生外交关系。中国只有一个政府，这就是以北京为首都的中华人民共和国中央人民政府。谁要是继续承认国民党匪帮“政府”，继续支持这个“政府”的“代表”在国际社会上进行罪恶的活动，谁就是表明自己对于伟大的中国人民的不友好态度。【新华社北京十五日电】
