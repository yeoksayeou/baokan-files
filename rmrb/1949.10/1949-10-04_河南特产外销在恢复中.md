　　Henan's Special Product Exports are Recovering
　　　　Henan's Economic Characteristics
[Our Correspondent in Kaifeng] Henan province has very little industry, but it does have large quantities of special products, such as tobacco (annual production of approximately 220 million catties throughout the province), cotton (one of the sixteen major producing areas in the country, with an annual production of approximately 110 to 130 million catties), wheat (annual production of approximately 5.92 billion catties, the main food source for the people), peanuts (annual production of approximately 400 million catties), tung oil (annual production of approximately 24 million catties, based on statistics from the Dabie and Funiu mountain areas alone), and other special products such as soybeans, eggs, and medicinal herbs. Historically, most of these have been exported as industrial raw materials in exchange for finished industrial products. Even some industries, such as oil mills, packing plants, egg processing plants, cigarette factories, and transportation businesses, have developed along with these special products. In the past decade or so, due to the plundering by Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang bandit gangs, and the obstruction of transportation, Henan's special products could not be exported, and prices plummeted repeatedly, leading to extreme hardship for farmers and low purchasing power, resulting in the stagnation of the entire Henan industry and commerce.

In the early period after liberation, due to the lack of restored transportation, the vast western and southern markets not yet being liberated, and the Kuomintang bandit gangs' shameless spreading of rumors, a general sense of panic and wait-and-see attitude formed among merchants, who dared not operate boldly. This temporarily led to a phenomenon of large businesses becoming small businesses or operating as street vendors. In addition, our economic departments took excessive measures to suppress the price increases during the spring famine this year (which was successful in addressing the difficulties faced by the masses at the time), resulting in urban grain prices being lower than those in rural areas. Consequently, there was a phenomenon of reverse flow of materials, and the market became sluggish for a time. In May, the provincial economic conference reviewed this deviation and, based on Henan's economic characteristics—the province having very little industry—concluded that organizing the export of special products first (i.e., promoting commerce) was the key to restoring and developing Henan's industry and commerce.

　　　　Special Products Currently Being Exported
The Provincial Trading Company, which leads the province's commercial activities, has shifted from wartime military procurement to regulating military and civilian supplies, purchasing and transporting native products, and supporting the production of certain industries. The provincial company currently oversees ten special administrative regions, two directly subordinate city (Zhengzhou, Kaifeng) branch companies, four specialized companies (cotton, tobacco, oil & salt, general merchandise), and sixty-nine ordinary city companies or county stores, with its operations covering the entire province. According to statistics from July and August alone, local trade companies purchased the following amounts of native products through private merchants (firms or peddlers): 8.5 million catties of cotton, 17 million catties of tobacco, 2.93 million catties of sesame oil, 1.8 million catties of peanut oil, 22 million square feet of homespun cloth, 60 million catties of wheat, and significant quantities of other grains, such as rice, millet, soybeans, as well as tung oil, pig bristles, and sulfur. This batch of materials has been partially transported to Shanghai, Hankou, Tianjin, Xi'an, and other places (with some being supplied to the people and troops in this region), and in exchange, it has brought back 20 million catties of edible salt, 44,500 bolts of various foreign cloth, 35,760 bundles of foreign yarn, 3,000 boxes of matches, 86,500 pairs of rubber shoes, and more than ten kinds of materials, such as gasoline, kerosene, paper, and glass. Most of these materials, such as edible salt, cloth, and other daily necessities, have been purchased by farmers who sold special products. With the exchange of materials, the number of firms and shops in Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, Luoyang, Xuchang, and other nine cities increased by 504 in July compared to April (with grain and salt firms being the most numerous). The transportation industry has also gradually recovered: in June, 24 transportation companies in Luohe established preparatory committees for resuming operations. Kaifeng has recently added 17 companies. Moreover, industries such as oil pressing and flour milling have also developed with the support of the trade companies.

The achievement of the above results is primarily due to the continuous southward advance of the war, the successive liberation of large cities closely related to Henan's economy, such as Wuhan, Shanghai, and Xi'an, which has opened up vast markets, and the rapid restoration of traffic on the Longhai, Tianjin-Pukou, and Pinghan Railways, as well as the smooth flow of various highways and waterways. Secondly, it is due to our firm correction of the vacillating deviations in the implementation of industrial and commercial policies (such as inappropriate regulations in management and taxation in the past), and our proactive support and organization of private merchants in operating the transportation and sale of native products and all commerce beneficial to production; encouraging policies have also been adopted for warehouses, brokers, and shops. After the provincial economic conference in May, commercial symposiums were held extensively in various places, correctly explaining our Party's industrial and commercial policies and Henan's economic characteristics, which gradually dispelled the concerns of merchants and provided them with clear guidelines for future business operations. Thirdly, the specialized companies have appropriately increased the prices of special products in their procurement. For example, last winter, one catty of cotton could only be exchanged for three to four catties of wheat (while before the war, it could be exchanged for nine to ten catties), while in July, it had been raised to eight to nine catties of wheat per catty; tobacco could not be exchanged for one catty of wheat this spring (while before the war, it could be exchanged for seven to eight catties of wheat per catty), but it has now been raised to three catties of wheat per catty. In terms of procurement methods, attention has been paid to studying domestic and foreign prices and market conditions in order to determine the quantity and price of procurement, ensuring that peddlers and transporters can make a profit, so as to maintain the normal supply of goods to the market.

　　　　Several Issues
Vigorously organizing the export of Henan's special products is laying the foundation for the development of Henan's industry. Therefore, expanding domestic and foreign exchanges and strengthening the circulation between industrial and agricultural products is extremely important. Based on the trade situation in July and August, the following issues still need to be better resolved.

First, due to the increasing expansion of the liberated areas and the restoration of transportation, the rise and fall of prices and the import and export of materials today have a national character. For example, price fluctuations in cities such as Shanghai and Hankou immediately after liberation led to a large outflow of Henan's special products and silver and gold, while industrial products could not be imported. Also, for example, a batch of tobacco that the Provincial Trading Company transported to Tianjin last month had to be sold at a loss because there were no customers with appropriate prices after it arrived. All of this illustrates that there is an urgent need for a national organization to provide unified leadership in trade work in order to grasp the rise and fall of national market prices, the import and export of materials, and the allocation of resources.

Second, the price ratio between industrial and agricultural products. Taking the price comparison of industrial and agricultural products in Kaifeng City before the Anti-Japanese War and at the end of July this year as an example: before the war, 21.25 catties of cotton could be exchanged for one bolt of white foreign cloth, but now it takes 45.45 catties of cotton to exchange for one bolt, a difference of 113.88 percent; before the war, one catty of tobacco could be exchanged for five small boxes of Hardamen cigarettes, but now it can only be exchanged for two small boxes, a difference of 150 percent, meaning that the price of agricultural products is far lower than that of industrial products. Although we have now raised prices, we cannot raise them very high all at once, so it is still impossible for farmers to significantly increase the cultivation of special crops, and the province's annual cotton production is still reduced by half compared to before the war. This is a problem that deserves attention.

Third, transportation and the establishment of cooperatives. To solve the current shortage of railway transportation capacity, the province is currently studying the price ratio between automobile and horse-drawn carriage transportation costs and railway transportation costs, as well as using waterway transportation, and if it is beneficial, it plans to adopt it on a large scale, which can solve a significant problem. Supply and marketing cooperatives are an indispensable part of the new democratic economy and a very good bridge for organizing the exchange of special products and industrial products, and should be placed on the important agenda in the future.

　　河南特产外销在恢复中
        河南经济特点
    【本报开封通讯】河南全境工业极为稀少，但它却有大宗特产如烟叶（全省年产量约二亿二千万斤）、棉花（全国十六大产区之一，年产量约一亿至一亿三千万斤）、小麦（年产量约五十九亿二千万斤，为人民主要食粮）、花生（年产约四亿斤）、桐油（仅大别、伏牛两山区统计年产约二千四百万斤），其他如黄豆、鸡蛋、药村等特产，历来大部是作为工业原料输出，而换回工业成品。即或有些工业如榨油厂、打包厂、打蛋厂、卷烟厂及运销事业也无不是随特产而发展起来的。十几年来，河南由于日寇及国民党匪帮的搜刮，及交通阻塞，特产不得外运，价格一再惨跌，农民生活困苦不堪，购买力很低，形成了整个河南工商业的停滞。
    解放初期，由于交通未得恢复，广大西、南市场尚未解放及国民党匪帮的无耻造谣，形成一般商人恐慌和等待观望的心理，不敢大胆经营，一时造成大商化小商或营摊贩的现象，加之我经济部门对今年春荒时的物价上涨，采取了过份的压抑（这对解决群众当时的春荒困难是有成绩的），使城市粮价反较农村为低，结果发生物资倒流的现象，市面一度呈现萧条。五月全省经济会议检讨了这种偏向，并根据河南经济特点——全省工业寥寥无几，认为必须先组织特产外销（即繁荣商业），才是恢复与发展河南工商业的关键。
    　　　　特产正外销中
    领导全省商业活动的省贸易公司，已由适应战时的军工采购而走向了调剂军需民食、收购和运销土产的业务，并扶助了某些工业的生产。省公司刻辖十个专区、两直属市（郑、汴）分公司、四个专业公司（棉、烟、油盐、百货）及六十九个普通市公司或县商店，其活动范围遍及全省。仅据七、八两个月各地贸易公司通过私商（行店或小贩）收购土产品计棉花八五○万斤，烟叶一，七○○万斤，香油二九三万斤，花生油一八○万斤，土布二，二○○万方尺，小麦六，○○○万斤，其他粮食为大米、小米、黄豆及桐油、猪鬃、硫磺亦为数颇巨。这批物资已部分运沪、汉、津、西安等地（部分供给本区人民及部队食用），换回食盐计二，○○○万斤，各色洋布四四，五○○匹，洋纱三五，七六○捆，火柴三，○○○箱，胶鞋八六，五○○双及汽油、煤油、纸张、玻璃等十余种物资。其中大部分物资为食盐、布匹及其他日用品已由出卖特产的农民购回。随着物资的交流，郑、汴、洛、许昌等九城市的行店七月份较之四月份增加五○四户（其中以粮、盐行为最多）；转运业亦逐渐恢复：漯河在六月份即有二十四家转运公司成立复业筹备会。开封最近亦增加十七家；而榨油、面粉等工业在贸易公司的扶助下，亦有发展。
    上述成绩的获得，首先是因为战争的节节向南推进，与河南经济息息相关的大城市如武汉、上海、西安等地的相继解放，而获得了广大市场；陇海、津浦、平汉铁路的迅速恢复通车及各线公路、航路的畅通所致。第二，是由于我们坚决地纠正了在执行工商业政策中的左右摇摆偏向（如过去在管理上、税收上的不适宜规定），而主动地扶助和组织私商经营土产运销与一切有利生产的商业；对货栈、行商、行店亦采取鼓励经营的政策。五月省经济会议后，各地普遍举行了商业座谈会，正确阐述我党工商政策及河南经济特点，使商人逐渐消除顾虑，并获得今后营业的明确方针。第三，各专业公司在收购土产上，酌情提高了特产品的价格。如去冬棉花每斤仅能换小麦三至四斤（战前则能换九至十斤），在七月时即已提高到每斤换小麦八至九斤；烟叶在今春每斤换不了一斤小麦（战前每斤换小麦七至八斤），目前也已提至每斤换小麦三斤。在收购方式上，同时注意了研究内外价格，市场情况，以便决定收购数量及价格，保证小贩运销有利可图，以保持物资上市正常。
    　　　　几个问题
    大力组织河南特产外销，即是奠定发展河南工业的基础。因此扩大内外交流，加强工农产品间的周转是非常重要的。根据七、八个两月的贸易情况看来，下面几个问题尚需更好地解决。
    第一、由于解放地区的日益扩大与交通的恢复，使物价的涨落、物资的吞吐和调度上在今天已带有全国性。如沪、汉等城市在刚解放时物价波动，使河南特产及金银大量外溢，而工业品不得输入。又如月前省贸易公司运津烟叶一批，到达后，因没有适当价格的顾主，而不得不亏本售出。这一切说明，贸易工作急需有一全国性的机构进行统一领导，以便掌握全国市场物价的升降、物资吞吐及调度等。
    第二，工农产品的比价问题。以开封市抗战前与今年七月底工农产品价格比较为例：战前棉花二一点二五斤可换白洋布一匹，现在却需棉花四五·四五斤换一匹，相差为百分之一一三点八八；烟叶战前一斤可换哈德门烟五小盒，现在则只能换二小盒，相差为百分之一五○，即农产品价格远低于工业品。现在我们虽已提价，但不可能一下提得很高，因而农民栽种特种作物还不可能大量增加，棉花全省年产量较战前仍缩减一半。这是值得引起注意的问题。
    第三，运输和建立合作社问题。为解决目前铁路运输力之不足，该省刻正研究汽、马车运费与铁路运费的比价及利用水运等办法，如果有利，拟大量采用，当可解决不小问题。供销合作社是新民主主义经济不可缺少的组成部分，是组织特产与工业品交流的很好桥梁，今后应该提到重要的议事日程上来。
