The Soviet Union Fears No Threat and Is Ready to Strike Back at Warmongers
    Every Soviet proposal aimed at maintaining peace and averting the threat of war is met with hostility by the imperialists and their lackeys. However, it is becoming increasingly difficult for the enemies of peace to manipulate their vicious conspiracies. The Soviet Union has consistently exposed every trick of the warmongers. The Soviet Union's policy of promoting peace is enthusiastically supported by the people of all countries.
    The enemies of peace place their main hope on the atomic bomb. They intend to realize their insane plans for world hegemony through threats and intimidation. That is why they are so stubbornly opposed to the prohibition of atomic weapons and are stirring up war hysteria.
    It is well known that no one is preparing to attack the United States. Although the Soviet government possesses atomic weapons, it now insists, and intends to continue to insist in the future, on its original position, namely, unconditionally prohibiting the use of such weapons.
    As early as 1934, Stalin said: "Our foreign policy is clear. It is a policy of maintaining peace and strengthening business relations with all countries. The Soviet Union does not want to threaten anyone, nor does it want to attack anyone. We advocate peace and safeguard the cause of peace, but we are not afraid of threats and are ready to respond to the attacks of war provocateurs with counterattacks." In 1939, Stalin pointed out when talking about Soviet foreign policy: "We advocate peace and the strengthening of business relations with all countries. This is our position, and we will adhere to this position as long as these countries maintain such relations with the Soviet Union, as long as they do not attempt to infringe upon the interests of our country."
    The Soviet Union has always been loyal to and will continue to be loyal to the principles expressed in these words of the Soviet leader. The proposals now submitted by the Soviet delegation to the Fourth Session of the United Nations General Assembly are based on these principles. The Soviet government calls for the five major powers to conclude a pact to strengthen peace. This proposal expresses the interests of all peace-loving people.
    The convening of the Fourth Session of the United Nations General Assembly comes at a time when the peace movement has truly become a mass movement, despite the frantic efforts of those warmongers who are desperately trying to poison the international atmosphere. The International Day of Struggle for Peace—the solemn demonstration of the masses in support of peace, which will be held on October 2—will serve as an unmistakable warning to those who disregard the lessons of history and once again seek to plunge the people of all countries into the vortex of bloody war.
    The United Nations, in its Charter, stipulates that it should make every effort to save mankind from the scourge of new wars. Therefore, the United Nations General Assembly cannot but listen to the voices of the millions of people who have risen up against the warmongers and are defending lasting peace and international friendship. These millions of people expect the United Nations to fulfill its great mission of ensuring peace and international security.

### 苏联决不怕任何威胁并准备予战贩以打击

　　苏联决不怕任何威胁并准备予战贩以打击
    每一个旨在保持和平与避免战争威胁的苏联建议，都遭到帝国主义者及其仆奴阵营的敌视。但是，和平的敌人已经愈来愈难玩弄他们的恶毒阴谋了。苏联始终一贯地揭穿战争贩子的每一个诡计。苏联促进和平的政策，受到一切国家人民的热烈拥护。
    和平的敌人把他们的主要希望寄托在原子弹上。他们打算凭借威胁和恫吓来实现世界霸权的疯狂计划。这就是为什么他们要如此顽固地反对禁用原子武器并鼓动战争歇斯底里的原因。
    尽人皆知，没有谁在准备进攻美国。苏联政府虽然拥有原子武器，但是，它现在坚持并且打算在将来一直坚持原来的立场，即坚持无条件地禁止使用这种武器。
    早在一九三四年，斯大林就曾说过：“我们的外交政策是明确的。它是保持和平及加强与一切国家之间商务关系的政策。苏联不想威胁任何人，也不想进攻任何人。我们主张和平并且维护和平事业，但是，我们不怕威胁并且准备以打击来回答战争挑拨者的打击。”斯大林在一九三九年谈到苏联外交政策时又指出：“我们主张和平和加强与一切国家之间的商务关系。这就是我们的立场，我们将坚持这个立场，只要这些国家对苏联维持这样的关系，只要它们不企图侵犯我们国家的利益。”
    苏联一向忠于并且要继续忠于苏联领袖这几句话里所表示的原则。苏联代表团现在向联合国第四届大会提出的建议，就是根据这些原则。苏联政府要求五大国缔结加强和平的公约。这个建议表达了全体爱好和平的人类的利益。
    联合国第四届大会的召开，恰是在尽管有那些拚命想毒化国际气氛的战争贩子的疯狂努力而和平运动仍然真正成了群众性的运动的时候。国际和平斗争日——将在十月二日举行的人民群众拥护和平的庄严示威——将成为对于漠视历史教训并再一次想把各国人民推入血腥战争的漩涡的那些人们的不可轻侮的警告。
    联合国在其宪章中规定，尽一切努力以挽救人类免于新战争的灾难，因此，联合国大会不能不倾听那些起来反对战争贩子并保卫持久和平及国际友谊的数以百万计的人民的呼声。这些数以百万计的人民，期望联合国履行它的伟大任务——保障和平与国际安全的任务。
