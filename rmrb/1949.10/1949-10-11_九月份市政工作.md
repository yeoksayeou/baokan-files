　　Municipal Work in September
Following General Ye Jianying's transfer south, the position of Mayor of Beijing was taken over by General Nie Rongzhen, appointed by the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission. Mayor Nie assumed office on September 9th. The capital of the People's Republic of China was established in Beiping, and Beiping was renamed Beijing. This was unanimously approved at the first plenary session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on September 27th. In accordance with this resolution, the municipal government notified all directly affiliated units and their affiliated units on the 28th to change the word "Beiping" on seals, stamps, nameplates, badges, and all stationery to "Beijing", effective October 1st.

In order to establish and improve urban traffic order, the municipal government formulated temporary traffic management regulations, temporary regulations for the management of automobiles, automobile businesses, and automobile drivers, and regulations for the management of large vehicle traffic. These various regulations were announced and implemented on September 10th and were earnestly enforced by the Public Security Bureau. In the past two weeks, with the active cooperation of all parties through publicity and action, significant achievements have been made. The order on important streets is well-maintained. In the future, as long as all citizens consciously abide by the various regulations, a good traffic order can be established in the people's capital.

On September 22nd, the Labor Bureau issued a notice stipulating the procedures for handling labor-capital disputes in private enterprises: If labor-capital disputes occur in private enterprises and the two parties cannot resolve them on their own, representatives from the industry's trade union and the trade association should be sent to negotiate a solution. If negotiation fails, either party may request mediation from the Labor Bureau. If mediation still fails, the Labor Bureau will submit the case to arbitration. If either party is still dissatisfied after receiving the arbitration ruling, the Labor Bureau will submit the entire case to the People's Court for trial. The labor-capital dispute at the Zhongnong Flour Mill in this city was mediated three times by the Labor Bureau, but no agreement was reached due to the employer's unwillingness to compromise. Therefore, on September 14th, the Labor Bureau convened representatives from relevant authorities to arbitrate, and on September 23rd, it issued an arbitration ruling, ordering both labor and capital to comply. On September 23rd, the Labor Bureau formally approved the collective labor-capital contract for the construction industry in this city. On the 30th, it approved the enterprise labor-capital collective contract. These are the second and third labor-capital collective contracts signed and approved since the approval of the national pharmaceutical industry collective contract on July 30th. In addition, on September 13th, the Labor Bureau convened a forum with representatives from labor and capital from 31 enterprises in 26 industries to facilitate the smooth resolution of their labor-capital disputes.

The "Beijing Municipality Regulations for Foreign and Overseas Chinese Real Estate Registration," formulated by the municipal government, was promulgated and implemented on September 15th. All foreign and overseas Chinese real estate within the jurisdiction of this city must be registered with the Land Administration Bureau in accordance with the provisions of these regulations from the date of promulgation until the end of October. In September, the Land Administration Bureau continued to handle real estate registration and issue ownership certificates in this city. As of the 27th, a total of 7,654 applications for registration had been received, and 2,345 real estate ownership certificates had been issued. On September 5th and 16th, the Land Administration Bureau held two collective mediations for housing rental disputes, which greatly improved work efficiency compared to the past.

Transforming industrial trade associations, strengthening production guidance for various industries, stabilizing prices, strengthening market management, and continuing commercial registration are the central tasks of the Industry and Commerce Bureau in September. Regarding the transformation of trade associations, new preparatory committees for the cigarette and soap industries, where more problems existed, were established in September. The preparatory committee members were elected democratically, and their task is to assist the government in investigating industry conditions and researching production technology to improve quality, reduce costs, and expand sales. To further strengthen guidance for private industrial production, at the beginning of the month, the Industry and Commerce Bureau convened a forum of representatives from various industrial trade associations and decided on a system of monthly written reports for each industry. In the middle of the month, it ordered unregistered factories and workshops to complete registration. In addition, the Industry and Commerce Bureau held forums with factory representatives from nine major industries, such as ironworking, weaving and dyeing, and needle knitting, to hear about the current difficulties in production, provide specific guidance on production plans, assist in orienting production towards the countryside, and decide to provide loan support to industries and factories with development prospects but facing financial difficulties in expanding production. Regarding the production and sales of Beijing's special handicrafts, an expert research institution has been organized under the leadership of the Municipal Industry and Commerce Bureau this month. In terms of market management, the grain exchange, which had been in preparation for over a month, was initially established on September 19th. It has more than 70 business personnel to manage and supervise transactions, which has greatly reduced illegal transactions and speculation. The site for a similar yarn and cloth exchange has been identified and will be established soon. At the same time, starting on September 10th, the city began a comprehensive inspection of street vendors based on the two principles of "no business without registration" and "vending only in designated locations," which not only improved traffic order but also protected the business of legal vendors. Regarding commercial registration, 35,563 households in 124 industries citywide have been registered, which is basically complete.

On September 19th, the municipal government promulgated the "Beijing Municipality Temporary Measures for Medical Personnel to Apply for Registration and Licenses" and the "Beijing Municipality Temporary Measures for Pharmaceutical Merchants to Apply for Registration and Licenses." It began to handle the registration and licensing of Western doctors, dentists, veterinarians, pharmacists, pharmacy students, and midwives who have independently opened or plan to independently open practices in this city, as well as the registration and licensing of pharmacies, raw drug stores, and Western medicine pharmacies and factories that engage in the business of traditional Chinese medicine decoctions and Western medicine. Based on accusations from various parties and after careful study, the Health Bureau banned the "Jingang Infant Pills" produced and sold by Tianxinghao in this city in mid-September to protect the health of citizens. In September, the Health Bureau successively convened three symposiums on school hygiene, factory hygiene, and environmental hygiene to discuss with relevant units how to carry out various hygiene tasks.

The municipal government, with the approval of the North China People's Government, established the People's Scholarship to assist students from poor families in public and private secondary schools or students who have lost economic ties with their families due to the war to continue their studies. In early September, the Education Bureau notified all schools with the "Beijing Municipality Temporary Measures for People's Scholarships in Secondary Schools." After receiving the notification, each school announced it to the students, conducted applications, and carried out reviews. In early September, the Education Bureau also conducted unified enrollment examinations for each grade of junior and senior high schools and established worker's children's classes to enroll out-of-school worker's children. The results were announced on September 19th, and a total of 2,333 students were admitted, including all 932 worker's children who applied. Veterans, military personnel, and cadres who passed the examination also received preferential treatment. In addition, the Education Bureau added two middle school classes to the Changxindian Central Elementary School to solve the problem of out-of-school workers' and peasants' children in the suburbs who had reached middle school level. The enrollment examination was completed in mid-September. Nineteen municipal elementary schools in seven districts of the urban and suburban areas were designated to add 34 worker's children's classes, and enrollment examinations are underway. In mid-September, the Education Bureau convened three meetings on elementary education, secondary education, and social education to arrange and discuss the work plan for the second half of the year. In terms of social education, as of the end of September, four People's Education Centers and three newspaper and reading rooms have been established in the urban and suburban districts of this city, and various forms of adult literacy classes are being established in a planned manner.

Based on the resolution of the All-Circles Representative Conference, the Construction Bureau, in addition to simultaneously constructing Guang'anmen Street, Xuanwai Street, Chaoyangmen Street, and Sanlihe to Dongliushujing and other four roads since September 1st, actively constructed Tiananmen Square. The first phase of the project was completed on schedule at the end of the month for the capital's people to celebrate the founding of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China. In order to cooperate with the restoration and development of the eastern suburban industrial zone and facilitate urban and rural transportation, the Construction Bureau decided to reopen Jianguomen, which was blocked by the Kuomintang, and work began on September 17th. Thousands of young workers and students participated in these two projects, making the work progress very smoothly. With the assistance of thousands of students from Jiaotong University and other schools, the Municipal Urban Planning Commission also conducted and completed a survey of the city's traffic volume in September.

The labor viewpoint of the prisoners in the People's Court Detention Center has gradually strengthened. The labor brigade, composed of more than 200 prisoners, has successively participated in projects such as the construction of Tiananmen Square and the reopening of Jianguomen. The detention center released 12 prisoners early based on their work attitude, and allowed 76 prisoners with sentences of less than one year to return home for accommodation, coming to the detention center on time during the day to participate in labor. All prisoners are clamoring to participate in labor to transform themselves.

The work of adjusting administrative villages and reviewing village cadres in the suburban districts of Beijing, under the leadership of the Suburban Work Committee, began in early July and was completed in mid-September. The criteria for this adjustment are: each administrative village should have between 200 and 800 households, neither too many nor too few, and the distance between natural villages within the same administrative village should not exceed five li. The completion of this work has completed a necessary part of the preparatory work for land reform in the suburbs and laid a more solid foundation for vigorously developing suburban agricultural production in the future. The work of rushing to harvest, plow, and plant in the suburbs was rapidly launched in mid-September, and by the end of the month, most of the harvest had been completed. The work of weeding and sowing wheat on arable land is still in full swing. The problems of manpower, animal power, and seeds and fertilizers in the autumn harvest and wheat planting campaign have been basically solved. Now, all suburban districts are striving to complete the autumn production increase campaign of planting more than 350,000 mu of wheat (an increase of 75 percent compared to last year).

　　九月份市政工作
    叶剑英将军奉调南下后，北京市长一职已由中国人民革命军事委员会任命聂荣臻将军继任。聂市长业于九月九日到职视事。中华人民共和国的国都定于北平，并将北平改名为北京，这是在九月二十七日中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议所一致通过的。市政府遵照这一决议，已于二十八日通知直属各单位暨其附属单位把印信、钤记、戳记、机关名称牌匾、证章及一切文书用纸上的“北平”字样，一律改为“北京”字样，并自十月一日起实行。
    市政府为了建立和改善城市交通秩序，特制定交通管理暂行规则，汽车、汽车行和汽车驾驶人的管理暂行规则，和大车行驶管理规则等各种条规，于九月十日公布实施，由公安局切实执行。两旬以来，在各方以宣传和行动积极的配合下，已经获得显著成绩，重要街道秩序井然，今后只要全体市民自觉地共同遵守各种规定，即可建立起人民首都良好的交通秩序。
    劳动局在九月二十二日发出通告，规定了私营企业劳资争议的处理步骤：凡私营企业发生劳资纠纷，双方不能自行解决时，由该行业工会与同业公会派代表协商解决，协商不成，任何一方均可提请劳动局调解，如调解仍不成立，由劳动局提交仲裁，在劳资双方接到仲裁书后任何一方仍不服时，即由劳动局将全案提交人民法院审理。本市中农面粉厂的劳资纠纷经劳动局三次调解，都因资方不肯让步而未获协议，劳动局乃于九月十四日召集有关机关的代表予以仲裁，并于九月二十三日发出仲裁书，令劳资双方遵照执行。劳动局在九月二十三日正式批准了本市建筑业劳资集体合同，三十日又批准了企业劳资集体合同，这是自七月三十日批准国药业集体合同后的第二个和第三个劳资集体合同的签订和批准。此外，劳动局曾在九月十三日召集二十六个行业中三十一家劳资双方举行座谈，以便使他们的劳资争议获得顺利解决。
    市政府制定的“北京市外侨房地产声请登记办法”，已于九月十五日公布施行，凡是在本市辖区内的外侨房地产，均限自登记办法公布之日起到十月底止，依照该办法的规定到地政局办理登记手续。九月份，地政局仍继续办理本市房地产登记和颁发所有权状的工作，截至二十七日，声请登记的共已有七、六五四件，发出的房地所有权状计二、三四五纸。地政局在九月五日和十六日分别举行了两次对房屋租赁纠纷的集体调解，工作效率较前大为提高。
    改造工业同业公会，加强对各行业的生产指导、平稳物价、加强市场管理，与继续进行商业登记这三件工作，是九月份工商局的中心工作。在改造同业公会方面，存在问题较多的卷烟、造胰两业的新公会筹备会已于九月间先后成立。筹备委员是以民主方式选举出来的，它的任务是在协助政府调查同业情况及研究生产技术，以提高品质，减低成本，打开销路。为进一步加强对私营工业生产的指导，月初，工商局曾召集各工业同业公会代表座谈，决定了各业逐月书面汇报制度，月中并令未登记的工厂作坊补行登记。除此而外，工商局前后与九个主要行业，如铁工、织染、针窑业等厂方举行了座谈，听取各业生产中目前存在的困难，具体指导生产计划，协助生产品面向农村，并决定对有发展前途、但扩展生产却感到资金困难的行业厂家予以贷款扶植。关于北京特种手工艺品的产销问题，在市工商局领导下，本月内已由专家们组织了一个研究机构。在市场管理方面，筹备月余的粮食交易所已于九月十九日初步创立，所中有七十余名业务员管理、监督成交，非法交易与投机行为因之大大减少。同一性质的纱布交易所所址业已觅定。不久当可成立。与此同时，九月十日起在未经登记不得营业及只许在指定地点摆摊的两项原则下，本市开始全面检查摊贩，不但改善了交通秩序，且维护了合法摊贩的营业。商业登记工作，全市一二四个行业已登记三五、五六三户，基本上已告完成。
    市政府在九月十九日公布了“北京市医事人员声请登录给照暂行办法”和“北京市药商声请注册发给许可证暂行办法”，开始办理已在本市独立开业或计划独立开业的西医师、牙医师、兽医师、药剂师、药剂生、助产士等的声请登录发给开业执照事宜，以及经营中药业汤剂饮片的药铺、生药庄及经营西药业的药房、药厂等的声请注册发给许可证事宜。卫生局根据各方控诉，经慎重研究以后，已在九月中对本市天兴号所制售的金刚婴儿片加以取缔，以维护市民健康。九月份内，卫生局曾连续召集了学校卫生、工厂卫生和环境卫生三个座谈会，与有关单位商谈如何展开各项卫生工作。
    市政府呈准华北人民政府设置了人民助学金，以协助各公私立中等学校家境贫寒或因战争原因与家庭断绝经济关系的学生继续其学业，教育局在九月上旬以“北京市中等学校人民助学金暂行办法”通知各校，各校于接到该通知后即向学生宣布，进行申请，并已进行审核。教育局在九月上旬还办理了各市立中学初高中各年级的统一招考，及增设工人子弟班招考失学工人子弟，已于九月十九日发榜，一共录取了二三三三人，其中报名的九三二个工人子弟全部被录取，报考的烈、军、干属凡经审查合格的也都受到优先录取的待遇。此外，教育局在长辛店中心小学增设了两个中学班以解决郊区中学程度的工人和农民子弟失学问题，已在九月中旬招考完竣，并在城厢区七个区指定了十九个市立小学增设三十四个工人子弟班，进行招考。九月中，教育局为布置和讨论下半年工作计划，曾先后召开了小学、中学及社教等三个会议。在社会教育方面，截至九月底止，本市城厢各区已经建立起来四个人民教育馆和三个书报阅览室，各种形式的成人补习班也正在有计划地着手建立中。
    建设局根据各界代表会议的决议，自九月一日起，除同时进行修筑广安门大街、宣外大街、朝阳门大街、三里河至东柳树井等四条马路外并积极修建天安门广场，该场第一期工程已经如期在月底完成，以供首都人民欢庆中华人民共和国中央人民政府成立大典之用。为了配合恢复与发展东郊工业区，便利城乡交通，建设局决定重开被国民党堵砌的建国门，已自九月十七日开工。在这两项工程中，都有数千青年工人与青年学生参加劳动，使工作的进行非常顺利。本市都市计划委员会也在交大及其他学校数千学生的协助之下，在九月份内进行并完成了全市交通量的调查。
    人民法院看守所的犯人的劳动观点逐渐加强，由二百多名犯人组成的劳动大队先后参加了修筑天安门广场、重开建国门等工程，看守所根据犯人的劳动态度提前开释了十二名，同时对刑期在一年以下的七十六个犯人准予回家住宿，白天按时来看守所参加劳动。犯人们全都在纷纷要求参加劳动改造自己。
    京郊各区调整行政村与审查村干部的工作，在郊区工作委员会领导下，于七月初开始至本月中旬全部完成。此次调整的标准是：每一行政村所辖户数应为二百至八百之间，不能过多或过少，同一行政村内各自然村间的距离应不超过五里。这一工作的完成，为京郊土地改革完成了一部分必要的准备工作，并给今后大力发展郊区农业生产奠定了更为巩固的基础。郊区抢收抢耕抢种的工作在九月中旬迅速展开，到月底止，已经大部收割完毕，耕地拔草种麦等工作仍在热烈进行中，秋收种麦运动中的人力畜力与种籽肥料问题，基本上已经得到解决。现在各郊区正在争取完成种麦三十五万余亩（较去年增加百分之七十五）的秋季增产运动。
