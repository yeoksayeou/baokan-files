　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 13th. To strengthen cultural exchange between the Chinese and Korean people, the Korean Ministry of Culture and Propaganda Film Bureau and the Northeast Film Corporation of our country signed an agreement in August of this year to exchange films. According to the agreement, the Northeast Film Corporation has transported films such as "Return to One's Own Ranks," "Bridge," "The Bountiful Northeast," "Three Years of Liberation War in the Northeast," and "Chairman Mao Reviews the Troops." Since September 27th, theaters in Pyongyang have been showing the second artistic epic "Return to One's Own Ranks" produced by the Northeast Film Studio in rotation. According to a theater manager, the film has been particularly popular with audiences. At the National Theater alone, it was shown for five days, with a total audience of 230,000. During the film's screening, many Korean newspapers published special articles by Korean playwrights and critics, who believed that the film had a high degree of ideological and artistic value and profoundly expressed the unity between officers and soldiers and the unity between the army and the people in the Chinese People's Liberation Army. One audience member said: "The People's Liberation Army is like the Korean People's Army, and the Kuomintang army is like Syngman Rhee's National Defense Army. The characters in the film are very close to us." Other films will also be shown successively.

　　朝鲜人民欢迎我国影片
    【新华社平壤十三日电】为了加强中朝两国人民的文化交流，朝鲜文化宣传部影片管理局与我国东北影片经理公司，曾于今年八月间签订交换影片的协定。根据该协定，东北影片经理公司已运来“回到自己的队伍来”，“桥”、“富饶的东北”，“东北三年解放战争”，“毛主席阅兵”等影片。自九月二十七日起，平壤各影院即轮流放演了东北电影制片厂的第二部艺术巨片“回到自己的队伍来”。据一剧场管理人谈称：该片观众特别踊跃，仅国立剧场一处，共演了五天，观众总数已达二十三万人。在该片放演期间，朝鲜许多报纸都发表了朝鲜剧作家和批评家的专文评论，认为这部片子有高度的思想性与艺术性，深刻地表现出中国人民解放军的官兵一致、军民一致。一位观众说：“人民解放军和朝鲜人民军一样，国民党军就和李承晚的国防军一样。片中的人物，对我们非常亲切”。其他各片亦将陆续放演。
