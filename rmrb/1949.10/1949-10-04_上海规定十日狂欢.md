Six million people in Shanghai are fervently celebrating the success of the People's Political Consultative Conference and the establishment of the People's Republic of China and the Central People's Government. The Shanghai Military Control Commission issued a notice on the evening of the 30th that all organs, organizations, troops, schools, factories, and shops in Shanghai would be closed for three days from the 1st.

The Shanghai Municipal Celebration Preparatory Committee has held a meeting and decided that from October 1st to 10th, it will be Shanghai People's Celebration Carnival Week. During the Carnival Week, a day will be chosen to gather hundreds of thousands of organized people to hold an unprecedented celebration rally and a demonstration parade to defend world peace. On the other days, each district will choose a day to conduct cultural and entertainment propaganda activities in a central venue. At present, the city's celebration preparations are in full swing. The giant statues of the four great revolutionary leaders, Lenin, Stalin, Sun Yat-sen, and Mao Zedong, each 30 feet high and 20 feet wide, made by the Fine Arts Association, have all been painted. Fifteen large decorated archways have been erected throughout the city. The performing arts community has been fully mobilized to participate in the grand parade. The Drama and Film Association and the Film Production Industry Union have mobilized more than a thousand people to form eight teams, including red flags, white doves, shields, torches, tableaux, gongs and drums, yangko dance, and music, to participate in the parade. All workers in the city have been organized into parade and demonstration teams. In the Hudong First District alone, nine general teams have been formed, totaling more than 50,000 people. The business community branch of the Celebration Preparatory Committee has suggested to the Preparatory Office of the Congress to build a bronze statue of Mao Zedong at the site of the former Peace Monument on the Bund. At the same time, they launched the casting of gold medals and national founding commemorative medals to be presented to Chairman Mao. The cultural, educational, youth, and women's circles, as well as large, medium, and small schools throughout the city, have also held meetings for days to mobilize and organize parade teams, and are now all ready. Farmers in the suburbs have also been organized and are preparing to participate in the parade. The democratic parties in Shanghai have decided to jointly participate in the grand parade. The Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association held a week of academic lectures starting from September 28th in response to the International Day of Struggle for Peace, introducing the construction of the Soviet Union and screening Soviet films. Thousands of Muslims throughout the city are scheduled to gather on the morning of the 3rd to celebrate and will participate in the demonstration parade. To celebrate this great festival, the Shanghai Postal Administration began selling nine types of Chairman Mao's portraits on the 1st. The new national anthem has been rushed to be recorded by the Great China Record Factory. Starting from the 30th, students in various districts of Shanghai and some factories have already started parades. On the afternoon of the 1st, 6,000 pedicab workers held a city-wide parade. The People's Liberation Army Songhu Garrison and the stationed field army are stepping up exercises, tidying up equipment, and preparing for demonstration parades. A certain unit has also gone to a certain place to hold a large-scale naval landing exercise. The Songhu Garrison Command and the Political Department, in addition to ordering the garrison troops to strengthen vigilance and patrol during the celebration carnival week to strictly prevent special agents from sabotage, specifically issued a notice on the 1st, stipulating ten temporary public security regulations to protect the safety of the upcoming people's celebration congress and demonstration parade.
