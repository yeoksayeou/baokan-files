Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 28th: TASS Moscow dispatch: In its international commentary on the 22nd, the Red Star newspaper commented on the French government crisis, stating that the true reason for the prolonged French government crisis is the pressure from the broad masses of the French people, who demand a fundamental change in policy. They are dissatisfied with the puppet show being played on the political chessboard and the replacement of one puppet with another by reactionary forces. The bitter experience of the two years of the Marshall Plan has not faded. Life itself has shown the French people that reactionary governments inevitably lead the country further and further down the road of losing national independence and becoming subordinate to American monopoly capital.

In the attempts to form a new cabinet, the chaos and panic of the French ruling clique are extremely obvious, which shows that the French government crisis is caused by very profound factors. As is well known, the Queuille cabinet, acting on the orders of Wall Street tycoons, implemented a new devaluation of the franc, forcing the French working class to stand up and oppose this new attack on their living standards. The policy of being hostile to the working class has completely failed. The economic and financial policies of the French reactionaries have also failed. Due to being involved in the adventurous plans of Wall Street tycoons, France has been forced to spend huge sums of money on preparing for war and on colonial adventures in Vietnam. During Queuille's 393 days in power, the country's military budget doubled, increasing from 400 billion francs to 800 billion francs. In the course of two years, the amount of currency in circulation has increased by more than half, reaching an astonishing figure of 1,186 billion francs. The French economic crisis and the continuous decline in the living standards of the working class are progressing side by side. Even according to the admission of the enemies of the working class, the people's purchasing power has fallen by 20 percent in the past year alone. The reduction in production in the most important sectors, carried out to please American exporters, has led to an alarming rate of unemployment. Assuming that in May 1947, when the Communists were expelled from the government, there were no unemployed workers in France, there are currently about 500,000 unemployed workers.

The French reactionary forces are using their last trick, attempting to form a "transitional" government, which will pass a law on majority electoral systems, dissolve the National Assembly, and hold new elections. According to the plans of the French ruling class, this will pave the way for establishing a "strong-arm" regime in the country. This is precisely the task of the Queuille government, precisely the task most suitable for Moch, the socialist who advocated shooting workers, and precisely the task for which Mayer, the official of the trust, was summoned to solve.

Why did the French people force the Queuille cabinet to fall and unconditionally tell Moch "no," and why are they now resolutely protesting Mayer's organization of the government? The reason lies here. The French working people demand the establishment of a democratic and unified government that enjoys the trust of the people and can implement a policy of defending peace and national interests.

    红星报评法政府危机
    【新华社北京二十八日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：红星报于二十二日在国际述评中，评论法国的政府危机称：法国政府危机拖延不决的真正原因为法国广大群众的压力，他们要求根本改变政策，他们不满政治棋盘上所进行的走狗把戏及反动势力以一个傀儡代替另一个傀儡。马歇尔计划实施两年来的愁苦经验并未消失。生活本身向法国人民显示了，反动政府必然把国家一步更深一步地带上丧失民族独立、从属于美国垄断资本的道路。
    在组成新内阁的企图中，法国统治集团的混乱及惊慌异常明显，这显示法国政府危机系由于非常深刻的因素所引起的。众所周知，葛义内阁按照华尔街大亨的命令而实施新的法郎贬值，迫使法国工人阶级挺身而出，反对这种对他们生活水准的新进攻。与工人阶级为敌的政策完全失败了。法国反动派的经济及金融政策也失败了。由于卷入了华尔街大亨们的冒险计划，法国被迫消耗巨额金钱于准备战争及在越南的殖民地冒险。在葛义三百九十三天的统治期间内，国家的军事预算数字加了一倍，自四千亿法郎增至八千亿法郎。在两年的期间内，货币流通的数量增至一倍半以上，达到了一万一千八百六十亿法郎的惊人数字。法国的经济危机与工人阶级生活水准的不断下降并且前进。即使根据工人阶级的敌人所承认的，人民的购买力在去年一年内也低落了百分之二十。为取悦美国出口商而执行的最重要部门的减产，使失业人数达到了惊人的比例。假定在一九四七年五月，当共产党被排出政府时，法国没有一个失业的工人，目前却有约五十万工人失业了。
    法国的反动力量在施用其最后一计，企图组成“过渡”政府，由这个政府通过多数选举制度的法律，解散国民议会，并举行新的选举。根据法国统治阶级的打算，这样将可能给在国内建立“铁腕”政权铺平道路。这就正是葛义政府的任务、就正是枪杀工人的倡导者，社会党的莫克所最合宜的任务，也就正是托辣斯的官吏迈耶被召来解决的任务。
    法国人民曾经迫使葛义内阁倒台，并无条件地告诉莫克“不行”，现在又为什么坚决地抗议迈耶的组织政府呢？其理由就在这里。法国劳动人民要求建立一个享有人民信任的、能执行保卫和平与国家利益的政策的民主统一政府。
