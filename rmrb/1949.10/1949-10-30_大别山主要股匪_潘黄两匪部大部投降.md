[Anhui North News] Of the four major bandit leaders in the Dabie Mountains (Wang Xian, Huang Ying, Yue Qishan, and Pan Shushi), Pan Shushi, the commander of the 4th Regiment of the Bandit Li Huang Detachment and concurrently the bandit district chief of Mapu District in Li Huang County, and his bandit group, under the victorious military might of our bandit suppression army, the correct implementation of the new district policies and bandit suppression policies, and the launch of a mass political offensive, have seen over 240 members surrender and reform in the past half month. Pan's bandit group has three battalions under its command. The first battalion (the main force, with four companies) has almost entirely surrendered with their weapons. Pan Zhuoqing, the company commander of the first company, and Chao Yingzhi, the company commander of the second company and concurrently the bandit town chief of Mapu Town in Mapu District, led their troops to surrender to Yangdian Township and the district government in Mapu District on September 25th and 22nd respectively. Chao Xiaofeng, the company commander of the third company and concurrently the bandit township chief of Sanchong Township in Mapu District, also led his troops to surrender to the district government on the 20th. On the 25th, Dong Longtian, the deputy township chief of Youma Township in Mapu District, led 21 men with 18 rifles to surrender to us along with Pan Zhuoqing. On the 14th, a portion of the second battalion, more than 30 men led by Yuan Pingliang, the bandit township chief of Kaishun Township in Mapu District, surrendered to our unit, bringing with them one light machine gun and three rifles. Another group of eight men also surrendered to our unit on the same day. In the past half month, according to incomplete statistics, a total of 241 members of this group have surrendered to our various units and local governments sporadically, bringing with them four light machine guns, 99 rifles, five Mauser pistols, one handgun, 800 rounds of ammunition, and two telephones.

Furthermore, the Huang Ying bandit group, the first detachment (i.e., the "Li Huang Detachment") of the bandit "Hubei-Henan-Anhui People's Self-Defense Army," one of the major bandit groups, has also been largely annihilated and disintegrated. The Huang bandit group had two battalions and six companies, totaling approximately 700 men. The third company of the first battalion and the fourth, fifth, and sixth companies of the second battalion have all surrendered to us collectively or sporadically. The second company of the first battalion has suffered a devastating blow from our army. The bandit leaders who have surrendered to us include Shao Zihou, the deputy regimental commander, Wang Houzhi, the regimental adjutant, Liu Enchang, the company commander of the third company, Mao Shougang, the battalion adjutant of the second battalion and concurrently the company commander of the fourth company, and Qin Zhengming, the company commander of the fifth company. Wang Yaochen, the company commander of the second company, and Wang Qiudou, the deputy company commander, were captured alive by us. Currently, the only remaining members of the Huang bandit group are the first company of the first battalion (all of whom are Huang's family members). We are currently searching and suppressing the remnants of this company.
