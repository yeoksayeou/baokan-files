Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 9th. The Communist Information Bureau's publication "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy" published an editorial on the 7th, entitled "The Great Victory of the People's Democratic Revolution in China," the full text of which is as follows:

The Chinese people are living through days of excitement and inspiration. The People's Liberation Army, winning victory after victory in succession, has liberated most of the Chinese people from the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek regime.

The People's Political Consultative Conference, recently held in Beijing, has declared China to be a People's Republic and has announced the establishment of a Central People's Government headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people.

The People's Democratic Revolution in China has won a great victory, a victory of world historical significance. The victory of the Chinese revolution will affect not only the destiny of all nationalities of China, but also the historical destiny of all other nations in the East and the West. The Chinese revolution has dealt a fatal blow to the combined forces of domestic reactionaries and world imperialism, and has dealt a new and powerful blow to the entire world imperialist system. This is the most serious defeat suffered by the entire world imperialism since the victory of the Great October Revolution and socialism in the Soviet Union and since the defeat of the Hitler fascist alliance.

In assessing the historical significance of the victory of the People's Democratic Revolution in China, we must remember Lenin's words: "In the final analysis, the outcome of the struggle will depend on the fact that Russia, India, China, etc., account for the overwhelming majority of the population." China alone has a population of 475 million.

The victory of the Chinese revolution has opened a new era in the development of China - an era of national independence after more than a century of foreign imperialist rule; an era of liberation of the people from the oppression of the domestic feudal class and the warlord-bureaucratic group composed of corrupt generals; an era of close brotherly cooperation between the Chinese people and the Soviet people, with the countries of Central and Southeast Europe that are advancing towards socialism, and with all the democratic people of the world; an era of extreme prosperity of China's economy, science, and culture, and a gradual transition to building a socialist society.

The Chinese People's Government is implementing major democratic reforms in agriculture and industry, in the political system and public education, which will provide conditions for the country's development to eliminate backwardness in a historically short period and become one of the advanced countries in the world. The guarantee of all this, as stated in the announcement of the Chinese government, is the unity of the People's Republic of China and all peace-loving peoples of the world, first of all the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries.

The corrupt military clique of the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, which has oppressed the Chinese people for more than 20 years, has now reached its end. This is completely obvious to all friends of free China, as it is to its enemies; it is clear that the victory of the People's Liberation Army is not only a predictable outcome, but also an established fact.

The victory of the Chinese People's Democracy also signifies the bankruptcy of the American and British imperialist policies toward China, the end of their plans to enslave China, and the failure of American intervention. Imperialist intervention in China was no secret.

Comrade Stalin taught that intervention is not merely a matter of military aggression, and aggression is not the main characteristic of intervention. In the current situation, imperialism prefers to engage in intervention by organizing civil wars in subordinate countries, funding counter-revolutionary forces against the revolution, and supporting its Chinese running dogs spiritually and financially against the revolution.

In 1926, Stalin pointed out that if those counter-revolutionary generals had not been instigated by the imperialists of various countries, and if they had not received supplies of money, weapons, instructors, and "advisers," etc., then they would have been simply unable to carry out the struggle against the Chinese revolution.

The larger the scale of the Chinese people's liberation struggle, the more blatant the intervention of American and British imperialism, and the more military supplies, money, instructors, and "advisers" they supplied to Chiang Kai-shek. Most of the equipment seized by the People's Liberation Army from the Kuomintang army was marked "Made in America." American imperialism has invested billions of dollars in Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary cause. These billions of dollars were extracted from the American people. The world hegemony pursuers across the Atlantic, in their "White Paper" intended to "explain" American policy toward China, admitted that American aid to Chiang Kai-shek accounted for more than half of the total expenditure of the Kuomintang government.

In contrast to this situation, the victory of the Chinese revolution has a particularly important significance, because it further weakens the imperialist front, intensifies the general crisis of capitalism, makes the inevitable demise of bourgeois rule revealed by the entire history of human social development closer, and makes the final victory of the working people of the world and the victory of communism come faster.

The great significance of the victory of the Chinese revolution and the guarantee of its invincibility lie in the fact that the Chinese revolution is led by the most progressive class in modern society, the working class, which is educated and led by the Chinese Communist Party.

Armed with the great theories of Lenin and Stalin and based on the historical experience of the Soviet working class and the Soviet Communist Party (Bolsheviks), the Chinese Communist Party established a revolutionary army, trained and equipped this army, and tempered it in battle. This party guided the broad masses of peasants to participate in the revolution, making them allies of the working class; this party united the people of all strata in China and inspired them to fight to destroy the reactionary feudal aristocracy and their imperialist masters. And today, this party is leading the liberated China with confidence along the road of consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship, along the road of restoring and developing the national economy, and along the road of improving the material and spiritual welfare of the working people.

The Chinese people won victory by relying on their strong, well-equipped, and disciplined revolutionary army.

The People's Liberation Army liberated one province after another. The behavior of the People's Liberation Army, its attitude towards the peasants, and its willingness to help the peasants at any time, awakened the consciousness of the masses, won the sympathy of the people, and attracted them to the revolution.

This is why, in fighting against such powerful enemies as the Kuomintang reactionary army, the Japanese imperialists, and the American and British interventionists, the People's Liberation Army was able to develop into an army of four million people that could not be underestimated, defeat the enemy, and liberate almost the entire country.

The October Revolution and the victory of socialism in the Soviet Union, as well as the Soviet Union's defeat of German and Japanese imperialism in the Second World War, had damaged the strength of world imperialism to such an extent that it provided decisive prerequisites for the victory of the Chinese People's Democratic Revolution. The Soviet people have given and continue to give the Chinese people great brotherly assistance.

Twenty-three years ago, when talking about the characteristics of the Chinese revolution, Comrade Stalin said: The Soviet Union exists and develops very close to China. Its experience and help will only facilitate the Chinese proletariat's struggle against imperialism and the feudal and medieval remnants of China. Real life has fully proved Comrade Stalin's words.

Without a doubt, the victory of the Chinese revolution will inspire the people of colonial and dependent countries to intensify their national liberation struggles. India, Burma, Indonesia, Vietnam, and other countries in the East - which Stalin defined as the major reserve force and main hinterland of world imperialism - have either become the center of the struggle for freedom and national independence, or have become a mature revolutionary reserve force. The People's Republic of China will be a loyal friend and reliable fortress in helping them fight against imperialism.

The reactionary forces of the world, especially American imperialism, will inevitably continue to use the most despicable means in the struggle against the national liberation movements of freedom-loving people, such as open military intervention, sending spies and traitors such as Tito and Rankovic to infiltrate the revolutionary movement. But as Mao Zedong said in his opening speech at the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: "The state system of people's democratic dictatorship is a powerful weapon to guarantee the victory of the people's revolution and to oppose the restoration schemes of enemies at home and abroad."

History has already pronounced the death sentence on imperialism. In our era, all roads lead to communism!

　　人民民主革命在中国的伟大胜利
    “争取持久和平争取人民民主”社论
    【新华社布拉格九日电】七日出版的共产党情报局刊物“争取持久和平，争取人民民主”以“人民民主革命在中国的伟大胜利”为题，发表社论，全文如下：
    中国人民正过着兴奋鼓舞的日子。一次又一次地连续赢得胜利的人民解放军，已使大部中国人民从反动的蒋介石政权之下获得了解放。
    最近在北京举行的人民政治协商会议已宣布中国为人民共和国，并宣告成立以中国共产党和中国人民的领袖毛泽东同志为首的中央人民政府。
    中国的人民民主革命已赢得了一个伟大的胜利，一个具有世界历史意义的胜利。中国革命的胜利，将不但影响中国各族人民的命运，而且还影响东方和西方其他一切民族人民的历史命运。中国的革命已予中国国内反动派与世界帝国主义间的联合势力以致命打击，已予整个世界帝国主义体系以新的、强有力的打击，这是自伟大的十月革命和社会主义在苏联的胜利以来，自希特勒法西斯联盟失败以来整个世界帝国主义整个体系所遭受的最严重的失败。
    在估计人民民主革命在中国的胜利的历史意义的时候，我们必须想起列宁的话：“归根结底，斗争的结局将取决于俄国、印度、中国等等占人口的绝大部分这件事。”仅是中国就已经有四万万七千五百万人口。
    中国革命的胜利，揭开了中国发展的新纪元——在外国帝国主义统治了百余年之后民族独立的纪元；人民从本国的封建阶级与由腐败将军所构成的军阀——官僚集团压迫之下获得解放的纪元；中国人民与苏联人民、与正在向社会主义迈进的中欧及东南欧国家以及世界上一切民主的人民亲兄弟般合作无间的纪元；中国经济、科学与文化极端昌盛，并逐渐过渡到建设一个社会主义社会的纪元。
    中国人民政府在农业和工业方面、在政治制度与公共教育方面实行重大的民主改革，这将为该国的发展提供种种条件使该国能够在历史上说来在短期内消灭落后，成为世界上先进国家之一。这一切的保证，正如中国政府的公告所说的，就是中华人民共和国和全世界爱好和平的各民族人民，首先是苏联和人民民主国家团结在一起。
    压迫中国人民二十余年的卖国贼蒋介石腐败的军事集团，现在已经到了它的末日了，这对于自由中国的一切友人，一如对它的敌人一样，现在是完全明显的；显然，人民解放军的胜利不仅仅是可以预卜的结局，而且是确定了的事实。
    中国人民民主的胜利，也表明美英帝国主义对华政策的破产，他们的奴役中国的计划的告终和美国干涉的失败。在中国，曾有帝国主义干涉，这并不是秘密。
    斯大林同志教导说：干涉不仅仅是军队侵略的问题，侵略并不是干涉的主要特征。在目前的形势下，帝国主义宁愿在附属国组织内战、资助反革命势力反对革命、在精神上与财政上支持其中国走狗反对革命，以此从事干涉。
    在一九二六年，斯大林曾指出，要是那些反革命的将军们没有各国帝国主义者的怂恿的话，要是他们得不到金钱、武器、教官和“顾问”等等的供应的话，那么，他们就简直不可能进行反对中国革命的斗争。
    中国人民解放斗争的规模愈大，美英帝国主义的干涉也就愈露骨，它们供给蒋介石的军火、金钱、教官和“顾问”就越多。人民解放军从国民党军手里所缴获的装备，大部分是有“美国造”这一标记的。美国帝国主义在蒋介石的反革命事业上，投下了数十亿美元。这数十亿美元都是从美国人民身上榨取来的。大西洋彼岸的世界霸权追求者在其意在“解释”美国对华政策的“白皮书”中，承认美国给蒋介石的帮助达国民党政府总开支的一半以上。
    与这种情况对比之下，中国革命的胜利就有着特别重大的意义，因为它进一步削弱了帝国主义阵线，加剧了资本主义的总危机，使人类社会发展的整个历史所揭示出来的资产阶级统治之不可避免的末日愈加迫近，使得全世界劳动人民的最后胜利和共产主义的胜利更快到来。
    中国革命的胜利所具有的伟大意义及其不可征服性的保证在于中国革命是由现代社会中最进步的阶级，受中国共产党教育和领导的工人阶级所领导的。
    为列宁与斯大林底伟大学说所武装的、以苏联工人阶级和苏联共产党（布）的历史经验为基础的中国共产党，建立了一支革命的军队，训练和装备了这支军队，并使它在战斗中百练成钢。这个党引导广大的农民群众参加革命，使它成为工人阶级的盟友；这个党团结了中国各阶层人民，并鼓舞他们进行摧毁反动的封建贵族及其帝国主义主子的斗争。而今天，这个党正满怀信心地领导着解放了的中国沿着巩固人民民主专政的道路，沿着恢复与发展国民经济的道路，改善劳动人民物质和精神福利的道路前进。
    中国人民是依靠他们的强大的装备优良与纪律严明的革命军队而获得胜利的。
    人民解放军解放了一个省份又一个省份，人民解放军的行为、它对农民的态度及随时愿意帮助农民的表现，唤起了群众的觉悟，赢得了人民的同情并把他们吸引到革命方面。
    这就是为什么在与国民党反动军队、日本帝国主义者及美英干涉主义者这样强大的敌人作斗争时，人民解放军能发展为一支拥有四百万人的不可轻侮的军队，打垮敌人并解放了几乎全部的国土。
    十月革命与社会主义在苏联的胜利，以及苏联在第二次世界大战中的击败德日帝国主义，已经损毁世界帝国主义的力量到如此程度，以至为中国人民民主革命的胜利提供了决定性的先决条件。苏联人民过去和现在就是这样给中国人民以伟大的、兄弟的援助。
    二十三年前，斯大林同志在谈到中国革命的特点时说：苏联紧靠在中国近旁存在着和发展着。它的经验和帮助只会便利中国无产阶级反对帝国主义以及中国的封建和中世纪残余的斗争。现实生活充分地证明了斯大林同志的话。
    无疑问的，中国革命的胜利将鼓舞殖民地和附属国人民加紧他们的民族解放斗争。印度、缅甸、印尼、越南及东方其他国家——斯大林给它们下的定义是世界帝国主义的重大后备军和主要腹地——已经或者成为争取自由和民族独立的斗争的中心，或者成为成熟的革命后备军。中华人民共和国将是帮助它们与帝国主义斗争的忠实朋友和可靠堡垒。
    世界反动力量，首先是美帝国主义，在反对爱好自由人民的民族解放运动斗争中，必定会继续使用最龌龊的手段，如公开的军事干涉，派遣特务和奸细如叛徒铁托、兰科维奇之流打入革命运动等。但是正如毛泽东在中国人民政治协商会议开幕词中所说：“人民民主专政的国家制度是保障人民革命的胜利成果和反对内外敌人的复辟阴谋的有力的武器。”
    历史已经宣布了帝国主义的死刑。在我们的时代，条条道路通往共产主义！
