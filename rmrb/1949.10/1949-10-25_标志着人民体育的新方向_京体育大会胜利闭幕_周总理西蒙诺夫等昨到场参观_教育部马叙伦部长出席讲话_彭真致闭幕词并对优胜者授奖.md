    [Our Newspaper's Report] The Capital People's Sports Meet, lasting three days, concluded victoriously yesterday (the 24th) and held a closing ceremony. The leaders who attended to observe yesterday included Premier of the Central People's Government Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Guo Moruo, Vice Director of the Financial and Economic Commission Bo Yibo, Minister of Education Ma Xulun, and Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CCP Peng Zhen. The Soviet delegation of cultural, artistic, and scientific workers, including Simonov and more than ten others, also attended to observe. The delegation's film crew specially filmed the conference in color.

    Yesterday's performance programs included fifteen items such as "Support Mao Zedong" and "Defend World Peace." The competition programs included six finals for the men's and women's worker and student groups in the 200, 400, and 800-meter relays. The basketball team of the Shanghai sports delegation and the soccer team of the Shenyang sports delegation held exhibition matches with the "Beijing United" basketball and soccer teams, respectively.

    The closing ceremony was held at 5 p.m. Minister Ma Xulun spoke first, stating briefly: The awakened Chinese nation, in more than a hundred years of struggle, has overthrown stubborn feudalism and bureaucratic capitalism, and driven out fierce imperialism. We have stood up. We are already the most powerful people's country in the East. We are already a strong and vibrant Chinese nation. However, although the physique of our Chinese nation has strengthened along with the progress of the revolution, we must strengthen our physical exercise so that each of us has an incomparably strong physique to meet this inevitable struggle to extinguish the enemy of all good people in the world—imperialism. Meeting this struggle is the task of every person in the People's Republic of China. We must shoulder this task, but to shoulder this task, we must first build a New China. The main thing in building a New China is production. All our people, directly and indirectly, must participate in production, and production is extremely in need of a healthy physique. Therefore, each of us should train ourselves into an indestructible body to build the New China well. Only in this way can we achieve greater victories in the greater struggles of the future. Then, the sports expert Ma John spoke, saying: "The Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government are leading us into a new era, opening up prospects for young people to serve the people. Therefore, we must develop sports, improve our bodies and minds, unite, and promote the strength of the collective to complete the great task of building the country." Worker representative Zhao Hongbin and student representative Xue Mingrong spoke successively. Zhao Hongbin said: "The fact that workers can participate in such a conference is given to us by the Chinese Communist Party, the heroic People's Liberation Army, and our brilliant leader Chairman Mao. The new sports are inseparable from the industrial construction of the New Democracy. In order to make our bodies stronger, we must bring sports activities to the masses of workers." Xue Mingrong said in her speech: "We are willing to resolutely respond to Mayor Nie's call, unite further, work hard to exercise, strengthen our studies, and strive to build our people's motherland and defend world peace." Finally, Comrade Peng Zhen, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CCP, delivered the closing address on behalf of the Presidium and awarded prizes to the winning units. Comrade Peng Zhen pointed out in his speech: This Beijing People's Sports Meet has now victoriously and successfully concluded. It demonstrates the unity of people from all walks of life in Beijing and also indicates the new direction of sports. He said: Our sports are not an expression of individualism, but a collective and mass sports movement. Our sports movement is for production, for the revolution, and for national defense. Everyone needs a strong body in order to develop our industrial and agricultural production, transform our agricultural country into an industrial country, and ensure from the physical aspect of the people that we can build a strong army, air force, and navy, and consolidate our national defense. Then he explained the relationship between collectivism and outstanding individual achievements. Finally, he hoped that the people participating in the conference would go back, take the lead in carrying out mass sports movements, so that all citizens of Beijing can participate in sports, have strong physical and mental strength, and make the Chinese people a people who are superior in thought, healthy in body, and have a high level of culture.
