　　Changsha
    [Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 1st dispatch] After the news that Mao Zedong was elected Chairman of the Central People's Government reached Changsha last night, people from all walks of life expressed their support. The New Hunan Daily and the Democracy Daily both rushed out extra editions overnight. The trade union preparatory committee of the Telecommunications Bureau immediately published a quick report to spread the good news to the sixteen units under the bureau. The propaganda team of the Political Department of the Garrison Command also appeared on the streets late at night. Wherever the trucks distributing extra editions of the New Hunan Daily went, citizens who had already fallen asleep got up one after another to scramble for the extra editions. When more than a dozen soldiers from the Dong District Public Security Sub-bureau excitedly got up to read the news, one soldier who had fought in the Central Plains for many years said, "It's great that Chairman Mao has been elected! We have been fighting for so many years to establish this People's Government!" A dockworker who was pushing a cart on the street immediately stopped to read the extra edition when he saw it. He said, "With Chairman Mao elected, China will have a way out."

    【新华社长沙一日电】当毛泽东当选中央人民政府主席的消息昨夜传至长沙后，各界人民一致表示拥护。新湖南报及民主报均连夜赶出号外。电讯局职工筹备会即时出版快报将此喜讯传至该局所属的十六个单位。警备司令部政治部宣传队亦于深夜出现街头。新湖南报散发号外的卡车所到之处，早已入睡的市民都纷纷起来争阅号外。东区公安分局的十多个战士在兴奋地起床阅读消息时，一个曾经在中原地区作战多年的战士说：“毛主席当选就好了！我们打多少年仗，就是为着建立这个人民政府！”正在街上推着小车的一个码头工人见到号外，便立刻停车去看。他说：“毛主席当选，我们中国就有办法了。”
