Learning This New Subject
    ——A Record of the Normal University's Physical Education Department Before the Sports Meet
    Shida Tongxun Zu

    Since late September, more than 140 teachers and students from the Physical Education Department of the Normal University have been busy with various preparations for the Capital Sports Meet. Amidst the joyous atmosphere of celebrating the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the birth of the People's Republic of China, and with the introduction from the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, 54 students went to more than a dozen departments, including the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, Mentougou Coal Mine, North China Military Region Infantry School, and Special Forces, to assist workers and People's Liberation Army soldiers in physical activities and other recreational activities, helping them organize various sports organizations. The students of the Physical Education Department of the Normal University took this as a learning subject. Some students who went to the factories wrote in their reports: "Only today do we truly understand that so-called sports should no longer be the exclusive domain of those studying physical education; it should be an important part of the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Only today do we realize that the set of sports theories learned in books is useless if not applied to practical work. Only today have we finally obtained a good opportunity. Things we never even thought about in the classroom before are now being done and have become a reality. How can we not feel proud?"

    The eighty or ninety teachers and students of the Physical Education Department in the school all regard the People's Sports Meet as a "compulsory course" to study. All the work of the People's Sports Meet has become the best material for their study. Not only that, but they also regard this subject as a political task to be completed. Under the leadership of Xu Yingchao, the head of the department, they participated 100% in the preparatory work for the conference, and under the organic coordination and mutual assistance of the preparatory personnel from 23 units including the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League and the Municipal Student Federation, they respectively took charge of general affairs, publicity, and layout work.

    On the 15th, 36 students and another four responsible comrades conducted publicity on the major streets of the capital. They went out at six in the morning and returned at seven in the evening. They gave speeches on the streets, distributed leaflets, and also jumped off the vehicles to perform skills, which won the welcome of tens of thousands of spectators, giving the citizens a new understanding of the people's sports. At that time, an old man squeezed in the crowd said: "I have lived so long, and this is the first time I have seen college students performing like this on the streets!"

    In their work, they did not forget to study and practice. As soon as dawn broke, they went to the large playground to practice parallel bars and basketball. After ten o'clock in the morning, there were two hours of study, and eighty or ninety teachers and students gathered together to discuss how to arrange the venue, dig sand pits, and how to do a good job in publicity. The white tracks on the Xian Nong Tan Stadium, the neatly arranged hurdles, vaulting boxes, and other venue arrangements were all the marks of their labor.

    In addition to work and study, they practiced group dances. At four o'clock every afternoon, they practiced the large dance "Unite, Democratic Youth Defend World Peace" with 140 students from various departments on the large playground.

    "This is really a good course, an unprecedented good course in the history of Chinese sports." This is a sentence often uttered during their work or rest. In the process of working and studying, the vast majority of teachers and students deeply experienced the great future of people's sports. When they saw workers, citizens, students, and ethnic minorities registering to participate in the sports meet, faces all revealed indescribable joy.

　　学习这新的课题
    ——记体育大会前的师大体育系
    师大通讯组
    自九月下旬起，师大体育系的一百四十余位师生，就忙着有关首都体育大会的各项准备工作。他们在庆祝人民政协与中华人民共和国诞生的欢欣情绪下，由市总工会的介绍，有五十四位同学分别走进了石景山炼钢厂、门头沟煤矿、华北军区步兵学校、特种兵团等十几个部门，辅助工人和人民解放军的战士进行体育活动和其他文娱活动，帮助他们组织起了各项体育组织。师大体育系同学们以此为一个学习课题。有几位去工厂的同学，在他们的报告书里这样写着：“到今天，我们才真正理解到所谓体育，不应该再是学体育人的专利品了，它应该是工农兵生活中的一个重要环节；到今天，我们也才了解到，在书本上学来的那套体育理论，若不用在实际工作上，那是一点用处也没有的；到今天，我们总算是获得了一个良好的机会，以前我们在课堂里想也没想过的东西，现在却已在做着而且已成了事实，这怎能使我们不感到自傲呢？”
    在学校里的八九十位体育系的师生，都把人民体育大会当做“必修课”来学习。人民体育大会的一切工作，都成了他们学习的最好材料。不仅如此，他们更把这一课题当做一个政治任务来完成。他们在系主任徐英超的领导下，百分之百的参加了大会的筹备工作，更在与青年团中央、市学联等二十三单位筹备人员的有机配合与团结互助下，分别担任了总务、宣传、布置等工作。
    十五日那天，三十六位同学跟另外四位负责同志，在首都的各重要街道上进行了宣传。早上六点出去，晚上七点回来，他们在街头讲演、散发传单，还要跳下车来作技巧表演，博得了成千累万观众的欢迎。使市民对人民的体育有了新的认识。当时，有一位挤在群众中的老头说：“我活了这么大，第一次看见大学生在街头作这样的表演！”
    在工作中，他们并没有忘掉了学习和练习。当天一亮的时候，就到大操场上练双杠、练篮球。上午十点以后，有两个钟头的学习，师生八九十人围拢在一起，讨论着如何布置场地、挖沙坑、如何搞好宣传。先农坛体育场上的那些白色的跑道，摆得井井有条的跳栏、跳箱及其他有关场地的种种布置，都是他们的劳动的标记。
    在工作与学习之余，他们练习着集体舞蹈。每天下午四点的时候，他们又与各系级的一百四十位同学在大操场上练起“团结起来，民主青年保卫世界和平”的大舞蹈来。
    “这真是一门好课程，在中国体育史上是空前未有的好课程。”这是在他们工作或休息的时候，常常吐露的一句话。在工作与学习的过程里，绝大部分的先生同学，深深地体验到人民体育前途的远大，当他们看到工人、市民、学生及少数民族来报名参加体育大会的时候，一个个的面孔上都显露出无法形容的愉快。
