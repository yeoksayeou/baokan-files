It is said that after Yu Bao talked with Niu Bao's sister-in-law for a while and swallowed two more opium pills, he felt a burst of energy. He plainly told the woman his idea: "We can only be grateful that Elder Ju Bao thinks highly of us. Besides, as a working man who makes a living by running errands, we can't just turn our back on people! Master Xi Lu can also be considered a respectable figure. If there's anything he can't resolve with Elder Ju Bao, won't they figure it out themselves? Even if they can't, it's none of our business. We'll just serve Elder Ju Bao, what's there to be afraid of!" But the woman was always a bit timid and cautioned him with raised eyebrows: "These two families are the heads of the village, one is like a flagpole, and the other is practically a money tree. Offending either one would be unlucky! I say, can't you think of a way to keep both sides happy?" Yu Bao felt that the woman's words were considerate of him, so he quickly said, "I have my own way, don't worry." After saying that, he lay down on the kang, thinking about ideas while watching the woman's hands as she sewed clothes on the kang, and unknowingly drifted off to sleep.

At this moment, Niu Bao returned. He was used to Yu Bao's affair with his sister-in-law and didn't find it strange. However, when his sister-in-law told him that Elder Ju Bao was looking for Yu Bao, he couldn't help himself. Without listening to his sister-in-law, he hurriedly woke Yu Bao and immediately asked, "What's going on? Ju Bao is unhappy with Xi Lu opening the kiln? Ju Bao wants to trip up Xi Lu? Ju Bao wants to pull you in to help him? Ju Bao..." Yu Bao quickly stopped Niu Bao, saying, "Why are you setting off firecrackers? A whole string of Ju Bao and Xi Lu, aren't you afraid there are ghosts in the room or people outside the window?" As he said this, he glanced at the woman and said, "I'm afraid you told him! He speaks without thinking, spreading rumors throughout the village. How will we make a living then?" The woman also glanced at Yu Bao, turned her back unhappily; Niu Bao stepped onto the edge of the kang with one foot and said, "Yu Bao, are you still a man? What kind of people haven't we seen? Why are we putting up with Xi Lu and Da San's attitude? Xi Lu used to treat us well, and we worked hard for him, we didn't just eat his food for free. Now that he doesn't treat us well, can't we switch to another business? This time, it's a great opportunity to get close to a wealthy and powerful person, someone we can't usually climb up to! Can we just let it go? Anyway, we poor people work for whoever feeds us, and we're not afraid of anyone biting us! Hmph! If we collude with Ju Bao, even if Xi Lu hates us, he wouldn't dare to even utter a sound!" Niu Bao waved his arms and clapped his hands, angering Yu Bao so much that he shouted, "Alright! Alright!" His sister-in-law also "pfft" laughed; Yu Bao quickly pulled Niu Bao to the side, and the three of them began to discuss their plan.

9.  The Conspiracy

The next day, Yu Bao had a firm plan in his mind and went to find Ju Bao's steward. That person was Ju Bao's nephew, who had grown up with Ju Bao. Although he hadn't studied, he was very good at managing Ju Bao's family business. He was a small, thin man who, relying on his uncle's strong backing, was a local hero in Black Stone Slope. When he handled affairs, he was straightforward and decisive. If anyone hesitated or muttered, he would stiffen his neck and tilt his head, as if he was going to risk his life to fight, scaring everyone cold and trembling. Locals call the head "da nao" (big brain), so they gave him the nickname "Qian Da Nao" (Dry Brain). This time, Yu Bao found him and cautiously probed his intentions. From his words, he realized that his guess about Ju Bao's intentions was correct, and he couldn't help but feel happy. He quickly began to tell him about his grievances; but he was impatient and said, "Why are you talking so much nonsense? If you hadn't suffered grievances from Xi Lu and Da San, would my uncle have looked for you?" As he said this, he tilted his head and lectured Yu Bao: "Remember! Helping my uncle and me is not the same as working for Xi Lu! We don't have time to listen to idle gossip! If you have the ability to get things done, you can have anything! Go!" Yu Bao felt comfortable after being scolded like this. He turned around and came up with a clever idea. He walked to Xi Lu's house in one breath.

When Xi Lu saw him, he casually asked, "What kind of business have you been doing these past few days?" He said, "These past few days? Master Xi Lu! To tell you the truth, I heard a rumor and I'm here to tell you!" Xi Lu said, "Did you go to Yangquan? Is there another commodity that's doing well?" He leaned closer to Xi Lu and said, "No. I heard that Elder Ju Bao appreciates our big kiln very much and wants to buy some shares; I'm not sure if it's true, but I have to let you know." Xi Lu was shocked and thought: He has so much good fortune that he wouldn't care about owning ten or eight kilns, why is he so stingy and wants to get involved with a businessman like me? I asked him to invest earlier but he didn't, and now he wants to invest, but he doesn't say it directly, and he doesn't even send someone to say a word! Thinking like this, he understood a little about what Ju Bao meant when he asked him to become the head of the cooperative last time, and he couldn't help but feel unhappy. He didn't ask Yu Bao where he heard this from, and reluctantly replied, "That's good! Yu Bao, go and tell him that I'm short on cash right now, and ask him to help me with some capital after the autumn harvest; if he's willing, we'll be pooling shares after the autumn harvest anyway, so ask him to invest and take the lead. Go! Speak carefully, and if you can't see him, find Qian Da Nao." When Yu Bao heard this, he was overjoyed; this was the clever idea he had come up with himself: let Xi Lu take a step back and let Ju Bao get involved, wouldn't both sides be happy? Wouldn't he be able to eat from both sides? He ran to Ju Bao's house in one breath to formally request an audience with Ju Bao.

Unexpectedly, this time Ju Bao's meeting with Yu Bao was very different from the first time. Ju Bao had just had some wine and was sitting on the kang, his eyes red. He glanced at Yu Bao, then turned and shouted, "Baiquan's family! Opium pills!" Here, Yu Bao's heart skipped a beat. He stood far away and said: "Master Xi Lu said: he's short on cash and asks you to help with some capital to open the kiln after the autumn harvest; if you're willing, he'll be pooling shares with people after the autumn harvest anyway, so ask you to invest and take the lead, or just give him a loan. Master Xi Lu is sincere." When Ju Bao heard this, he pushed the kang table away and pointed at Yu Bao, asking: "Didn't you tell Qian Da Nao that you were planning to eat with me for a few days? Why are you saying things that don't sound like you want to eat with me?" As he said this, he slammed his hand on the kang table and scolded: "Why didn't he say he was sincere earlier? Who is he trying to deceive with his kindness now? Is he too sick to get out of bed? Why didn't he come himself?" As he said this, Ju Bao jumped off the kang without putting on his shoes, wearing only a pair of snow-white socks. He ran into Baiquan's family, who was bringing him opium pills. He shouted at the maid, "What are you doing here?" Scaring the maid to retreat. He glared with a pair of red eyes, the flesh on his fat face twitching. He stretched out an arm to Yu Bao and said, "Go! Go tell Xi Lu! Just say that I, Ju Bao, am so poor that I can't even feed myself, so I wouldn't dare to dream of investing in his big kiln! Just say that if I ever run out of food, I'll have to ask him for the favor! Hmph!" After saying that, he sat down on the edge of the kang, tightly closing his mouth, but the flesh on his fat face twitched even more violently. His two nostrils were panting, as if he was about to fight someone.

　　黑石坡煤窑演义（９）
    康濯
    却说当时玉宝跟牛宝他嫂谈说了一阵，又吞了两粒大烟丸，不觉精神一振，就明着把自己的主意告给女人道：“聚宝他老人家能给咱们赏脸，咱们还能说个不？再说，咱一个受苦人，凭跑腿吃饭，也没什么翻脸不认人！喜禄爷嘛，也能算是桌面上人物，他跟聚宝老人家有什么搁不住，自己还不会圆转？就是他二人圆转不了，那也不与咱相干，咱侍候侍候聚宝老人家的，怕什么！”但女人总有点胆小，还是翻着眉眼安插他道：“这两家都是当村当家的，一个旗杆，一个不是摇钱树吧也差不多，得罪了谁也背兴呀！我说，你不能想个法把两边都闹得圆圆乎乎的？”玉宝觉着女人这话倒还是体贴自己，忙说：“我自有办法，你放心。”说完，他往炕上一躺，一边想主意，一边两眼望着炕上女人裁衣裳的手，迷迷盹盹地不觉就睡着了。
    这时牛宝回来了。玉宝跟他嫂的事，他是见惯了的，并不稀罕；但他嫂告给了他聚宝老人家找玉宝的事，他却忍不住，也不听他嫂的话，忙忙推醒玉宝，劈头劈脑就问道：“怎么？聚宝不高兴喜禄开窑？聚宝想扯喜禄的腿？聚宝想拉你帮他？聚宝……”玉宝连忙止住牛宝道：“你这放什么鞭炮啊你？一连串聚宝喜禄的，也不怕房中有鬼窗外有人？”说着，他又朝女人眼睛一斜：“我就怕你告给他的！他说话没稿子，顺口溜给你浑村一筛锣，你说咱们还吃饭不？”女人也眼睛对玉宝一瞟，不高兴地背过身去；牛宝却一只脚往炕沿一踏，说道：“玉宝哥你这还算个男子汉？咱们什么人没见过？为什么生生受人家喜禄跟大三的气？以前喜禄赏咱脸，咱也是给他卖力气，也没白吃他的；如今他不赏咱们，咱们不行换个买卖？这回又是个大富大贵的好东家，平日咱使劲爬也爬不上哩！还能撂了不干？反正咱穷人为的嘴，谁养活咱跟谁跑腿，咱还怕谁咬了咱个球！哼！咱们要是跟聚宝窜连上，他喜禄就是恨了咱们吧，怕他连哼也不敢哼哩！”牛宝又挥胳膊又拍巴掌的，气得玉宝连嚷“算啦！算啦！”他嫂也“卟哧”笑起来了；玉宝赶忙把牛宝拉过一边，三个商量开了主意。
    九　阴谋
    第二天，玉宝心里拿定了个准主意，去找聚宝那个管家的。那人是聚宝的侄儿，跟着聚宝长大的，虽说没念过书，却很会调理聚宝的家业；那人长得干巴瘦小个，仗着叔父腰板硬，在黑石坡也就是个一村的英雄，办起事来，一句话，干干脆脆，谁要哼哈半句，他就脖子一硬脑袋一歪，象要豁出个脑袋跟人拼命一般，吓得谁也心发凉腿发抖；当地人们管脑袋叫“大脑”，因此就给他取了个外号，叫“乾大脑”。这时玉宝找着他，拐弯抹角地探了探口风，从他的话里边，听出来自己对聚宝的心事揣模得没走眼，不觉心中高兴，就忙向他诉说起自己的冤屈；但他却不耐烦，说道：“你噜嗦这些干什么？你要不背上喜禄大三的冤屈，我叔还找你？”说着，他脑袋一歪，教训玉宝道：“记着！跟咱叔侄俩帮忙，可跟你给喜禄办事不一样！咱们没工夫听那些闲话！有本领你把事办成，要什么有什么！去吧！”玉宝挨了这么一顿训，心中反倒舒舒坦坦地，回头就想了个巧主意，一口气往喜禄家走去。
    喜禄见了他，信口问他道：“这两天作什么营生来着？”他道：“这两天么？喜禄爷！不瞒你说，听到个风声，给你透一透！”喜禄道：“你去阳泉了么？又是什么货有了行市？”他凑近喜禄跟前说：“不是。我听说聚宝老人家很赏识咱这大窑，想入几个股子；确不确不敢说，可不能不透个讯。”喜禄不觉大吃一惊，心想：他那福份，自己滚十座八座窑也不稀罕，怎么那末小气，倒要跟我这买卖人勾扯？早先我请他入股他不入，这会要入股，却又不当面说明，也不派人送句话的！这么一想，也就明白了一点上回聚宝要他顶社首的意思，不免心眼不痛快，也没打问玉宝这话是从那里听来，就勉强答道：“那好嘛！玉宝，你就去走一遭，对他老人家说我手头正紧，请他秋后帮补个垫本；他老人家要乐意，反正秋后咱们也是砸股子干，就请他老人家入股领头也行。去吧！说话稳实些，见不着他老人家，找乾大脑也行。”玉宝一听，满心欢喜；原来这就是他自己想出的巧主意：让喜禄让一步，让聚宝沾一手，不是两面都圆圆乎乎了么？不是他倒能吃两面饭了么？他又一口气跑到聚宝家，正式求见聚宝去了。
    不想这回聚宝见了玉宝，却跟头一回大不同。聚宝正喝了点酒，坐在炕上，两眼红红地，望了玉宝一眼，回头喊道：“白泉家！烟丸！”这里玉宝心眼卜通发跳，站得远远的说：“喜禄爷说的：他手头不宽裕，秋后求你老人家帮补点垫本开窑；你老人家要是乐意嘛，反正秋后他也是跟人碰股子闹，就请你老人家入点股领头干，要不就出借条。喜禄爷这可是真心实意。”聚宝一听，忙把炕桌一推，手指玉宝直问道：“你不是给乾大脑说过，打算跟我吃两天饭么？怎么这会又说些不象要吃饭的话？”说着，他往炕桌上就是一巴掌，骂道：“他真心实意为什么不早说？他这会送人情哄骗谁？他病得起不来炕么？为什么自己不来？”说着，聚宝鞋也没穿，脚上一双雪白的凉袜，就往炕下一跳，正碰见白泉家给他送大烟丸来，他冲着使女嚷道：“你上这干什么？”吓得那使女忙退回去了；只见他狠狠鼓着一对红眼珠，肥脸上的肉一动一动地，伸出一个胳膊对玉宝道：“去！去告给喜禄！就说我聚宝穷得嘴也顾不住，可不敢心高妄想给他大窑入股子！就说有朝一日我没吃的，还得求他赏脸哩！哼！”说完，他往炕沿一坐，紧闭住嘴，肥脸上的肉却动得更厉害了，两个鼻孔直呼呼出气，真象要跟人打架一般。
