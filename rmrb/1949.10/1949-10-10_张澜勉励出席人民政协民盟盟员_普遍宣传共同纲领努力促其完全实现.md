　　Zhang Lan Encourages Members of the China Democratic League Attending the CPPCC
　　Universally Publicize the Common Program and Strive for its Complete Realization
　　[This newspaper reports] The headquarters of the China Democratic League held a dinner party yesterday (9th) at 5:00 PM in the East Restaurant of the Beijing Hotel to entertain all League members attending the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. More than 70 people attended. Zhang Lan, Chairman of the China Democratic League, first delivered a speech stating: "The League comrades who emerged as CPPCC representatives from various units and localities number as many as 90, which was not initially expected. Moreover, these representatives naturally emerged from various units and localities, without any prior organizational arrangement. This proves that the number of League comrades distributed in various places is not small. And they all play a role in the revolutionary work, all have demonstrated themselves, so they can naturally produce so many representatives from all aspects. This is the result of the efforts of all comrades, and it is also the glory of our League. Since our comrades are numerous as representatives in the CPPCC, therefore, our responsibility for supporting the CPPCC and completing the construction of the new China is particularly great. The program of the CPPCC is the program of our Democratic League, and it is the model of action for each of our comrades. In the future, our comrades, dispersed in various places, should each be at their posts, universally publicizing the Common Program of the CPPCC to the people of the whole country, and promoting the realization of the Common Program one by one. This is the sacred responsibility of each of our comrades. Among the representatives, there should be a high sense of responsibility. A gathering like today's has never happened in the past. This symbolizes the spirit of unity. In the past, our comrades worked hard on revolutionary work in different ways, and their purpose was to unite the people to realize the New Democracy. Today, our goal has been achieved. However, as Chairman Mao said, this is just the first step in the Long March. We need to unite the people for a long time to consolidate the political power of the people's democratic dictatorship, to eliminate all reactionary remnants, and then we can thoroughly realize the New Democracy, and move forward to the distant goal. The work of uniting the people should first start from the self-unity of the League. We must unite ourselves before we can exert the power of uniting the people. The spirit of unity of our League today, I hope to always maintain, promote and carry forward."
　　After Zhang Lan finished his speech, entertainment programs were carried out. The entire banquet proceeded in joy, and ended in singing the national anthem at 8 o'clock.

　　张澜勉励出席人民政协民盟盟员
    普遍宣传共同纲领努力促其完全实现
    【本报讯】中国民主同盟总部昨（九）日下午五时假北京饭店东餐厅举行餐会，招待全体出席中国人民政治协商会议该盟盟员。到会者共七十余人。首由民盟主席张澜致词称：“本盟同志从各单位各地方产生出来的政协代表，竟达九十位之多，这是初意所不及料的，而这些代表，又都是很自然的从各单位各地方产生出来，并不是事先有什么组织安排。这证明本盟同志分布在各方的人，不在少数。而且在革命工作上，都起着作用，都有所表现，所以才很自然的能从各方面产生了这样多的代表，这点，是各位同志的努力的结果，也是本盟的光荣。我们同志在政协中的代表，既为数很多，因之我们对于拥护政协，完成新中国建设的责任，也就特别大。政协的纲领，就是我们民盟的纲领，就是我们每一位同志的行动典范。今后我们同志，分散到各地方，便应当各就岗位，对政协共同纲领，普遍向全国人民宣传，并且促使共同纲领一一都兑现实行，这是我们每一位同志的神圣责任。在各位代表同志，更是应有高度责任感的。象今天这样的聚会，在过去是不曾有过的。这象征着团结的精神，我们各位同志，过去是分道扬镳的努力于革命工作，而其目的则在团结人民实现新民主主义。今天我们的目的，是达到了。但是，诚如毛主席说的，这不过是万里长征走了第一步。我们更需要长期团结人民，以巩固人民民主专政的政权，以肃清一切反动残余的力量，然后才能使新民主主义彻底实现，更向着遥远的目的进步前行，这个团结人民的工作，首先就当从本盟的自己团结做起，必须自己团结，然后才能发挥出团结人民的力量，今天本盟这种团结的精神，希望永远保持，发扬而光大之。”
    张澜致词毕，进行余兴节目。整个宴会在欢乐中进行，至八时始在合唱国歌声中尽欢而散。
