　　Breaking Through the "Three Barriers" of Writing

    My article suddenly appeared in the "People's Garden" on September 16th, which made my heart beat fast!

    After graduating from elementary school at the age of twelve, "money"! didn't allow me to go to school! That's just how it was in the old society.

    "Writing an article will shorten my life by a few months!" This is a phrase I often had on my lips; it's also my most painful sentence. With a low level of education, I couldn't even speak fluently, let alone understand what punctuation marks were. Writing articles? How easy could that be!

    Comrades were becoming more and more active on the wall newspaper every day. Seeing other people's articles, I was really envious, hating myself for not having the ability to write. Although I recognized a few characters, I was always afraid that if I didn't write well, people would laugh at me. Later, after the criticism of vanity on the wall newspaper and the help of my comrades, I finally made up my mind: "Team leader, you help me write, and I'll hand it in on time!" In this way, I broke through the first barrier—"daring not to write"—and submitted my first article ever.

    But, I was immediately hit with a stick, and the wall newspaper committee criticized me severely: "Empty," "disorganized," "like Grandma Wang's foot binding cloth, smelly and long"... This blow almost knocked me unconscious, but I thought: "Didn't our team leader get criticized six times for an article? Didn't he revise it seven times? Why can't I learn from the team leader?..." After a fierce ideological struggle, I finally spent a great deal of effort to break through the second barrier—"fear of criticism"—and wrote my second article.

    This time it was published, and even on the front page..., my enthusiasm was also sufficient, and my courage was even greater. For the wall newspaper that comes out every ten days, I want to strive to write at least one article and have it published.

    Under the cultivation of the wall newspaper, I gradually wanted to try to write for the "People's Garden". In early August, I secretly sent my article. One day, two days, it wasn't published, but I never gave up. Two articles...five or six articles, I just buried my head and wrote. Ten days and a half months... my article was never seen! At this time, I began to examine myself: I still had the problems of being "verbose," "disorganized," and "smelly and long," but more importantly, I was "eager for success," writing regardless of whether it was good or bad. I couldn't write myself and was too shy to discuss it with others, how could that work! After the review, I bravely broke through the third barrier—"despair when not published." After the revision and help of comrades, I wrote my seventh article.

    After my article appeared in "People's Garden," it further encouraged my mood. I want to work hard, work harder, and work harder... study more and study more.

    The published article is not necessarily good, and some places have been revised by the editors, but from here I have gained a little experience: breaking down vanity and saving face, not only should you not be afraid of criticism, but you should also often find comrades to study with. If it's not published, don't be discouraged, treat it as practice writing. If it's not published, you still have to write. When writing, pay attention to the truth of the content, grasp the center of the problem, don't be greedy for too much, and don't use clouds and mist to describe it randomly. Also, you must pay attention to the newspaper and expand your learning scope.

### 突破写稿“三关”

　　突破写稿“三关”
    九月十六的“人民园地”上突然发现了我的稿子，真使我心跳得厉害！
    我十二岁小学毕业后，“钱”！就不允许我上学啦！在旧社会里，就是这么一回事。
    “写篇稿子要少活几个月”！这是我常挂在嘴边的一句话；也是我最痛苦的一句话。文化程度低，连话都说不伸展，更不懂啥叫标点符号，写稿子，谈何容易！
    同志们一天天在墙报上活跃起来啦，看见人家的稿子，真有些羡慕，自己恨着自己没有本事写，虽然也认识几个方块字，但总是怕写不好别人笑话。后来经过墙报上对虚荣心的批判，和同志们的帮助，我才下了决心：“组长，你帮助我写，限我时间交！”这样突破了第一关——“不敢写”，破天荒的投了第一篇稿。
    但，当头就是一棒，被墙报委员会批评了一顿：“空洞”，“杂乱”，“王大娘的裹脚布，又臭又长”……这一棒差点给打昏，但是我想：“我们组长为着一篇稿子不是叫人家批评过六次吗？他不是修改过七次吗？我为什么不向组长学习呢？……”经过激烈的思想斗争，终又费了九牛二虎之力突破了第二关——“怕批评”写出了第二篇稿子。
    这回可登出来啦，还在第一版……，劲头也足啦，勇气更大啦，十天一次的墙报，我要争取至少写一篇，还要叫它登上。
    在墙报的培养下，渐渐地就想往“人民园地”试一试，八月初，偷偷的寄去了我的稿子，一天，二天，不见登，可是我总没有泄气，两篇……五篇六篇，只是埋着头写，十天半月……总不见我的稿子！这时我就开始了检讨：仍是存在着“罗嗦”“零乱”“臭长”的毛病，但更重要的是“急于求成”，不管好坏只管写。自己不会写又怕羞不找别人商量，那还成哇！检讨后我又勇敢的突破了第三关——“不登就灰心”。经过了同志的修改帮助，我又写出了第七篇。
    “人民园地”出现我的稿子后，更鼓舞了我的情绪，我要努力努力再努力。……钻研更钻研。
    登出的稿子也不见得怎好，并有些地方经了编辑同志的修改，但从这里我得到了一点经验：打破虚荣爱面子，不但不应该怕批评，而且要经常找同志研究。没有登出，不要灰心，当作自己练习写作，不登还是要写；写的时候，注重内容的真实，抓着问题中心，别贪多更不要云呀、雾呀的去乱形容一套，再则必须关心报纸，扩大自己的学习面。
