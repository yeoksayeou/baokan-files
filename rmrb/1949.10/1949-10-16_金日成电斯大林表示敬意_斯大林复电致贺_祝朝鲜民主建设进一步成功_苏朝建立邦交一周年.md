Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 15th: TASS, Moscow, 14th: Marshal Stalin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, received the following congratulatory telegram from Mr. Kim Il-sung, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea:
　　Respected Marshal Stalin:
　　On the occasion of the first anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Respected Marshal, I, on behalf of the government and people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and myself, extend sincere friendship and gratitude to you and, through you, to the Soviet government and all the Soviet people.
　　The Soviet Union, the first to establish diplomatic relations with our young republic, has once again demonstrated to the Korean people and the world that it is always faithful to its policy principles of consolidating the friendship of all peoples and respecting the sovereignty and equality of nations, large or small.
　　The Agreement on Economic and Cultural Cooperation between the Soviet and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, concluded in March of this year and based on complete equality between the two parties, has had and is having a tremendous impact on the progress of all aspects of our economic and cultural life. With the assistance of the Soviet Union, our country has achieved great successes not only in economic recovery but also in the reconstruction of the national economy, which is based on the unwavering democratic reforms implemented by the people's democratic government. Our people, defending the rights of an independent and sovereign democratic state against the attempts of American imperialism to re-enslave Korea, have consistently received, and are now receiving, the sympathy and support of the great Soviet Union—the liberator and friend of the Korean people.
　　In commemorating this first anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Soviet and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which opened a new page in Korean history, the Korean people would like to extend to you, Marshal Stalin, their warmest respects and wish you good health for the benefit of progressive mankind.

    【新华社北京十五日电】塔斯社莫斯科十四日讯：苏联部长会议主席斯大林大元帅接获朝鲜民主主义人民共和国部长会议主席金日成先生贺电如下：
    尊敬的斯大林大元帅：
    值此苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟与朝鲜民主主义人民共和国建立外交关系一周年之际，尊敬的大元帅，我谨代表朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府、人民及我个人，向你而且向你所代表的苏联政府及全体苏维埃人民，表示真诚的友谊和谢忱。
    第一个与我们年青共和国建立外交关系的苏联再度向朝鲜人民及全世界表明了：它是始终忠实于它的巩固各国人民友谊、尊重大小民族主权与平等的政策原则的。
    今年三月苏联与朝鲜民主主义人民共和国之间所缔订的、以双方完全平等为基础的经济文化合作协定，已经而且正在对我国经济与文化生活一切方面的进步产生巨大的影响。在苏联的帮助下，我国已经不仅在经济恢复上而且也在国民经济的重建上获得了伟大的成就，这些是以人民民主政府所实行的坚守不渝的民主改革为基础的。我国人民保卫着独立的权利与主权的民主国，反对美帝国主义再度奴役朝鲜的企图，他们一贯获得，而且现在也正获得伟大苏联——朝鲜人民的解放者与朋友——的同情和支持。
    在纪念为朝鲜历史打开新的一页的、苏联与朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外交关系的建立之一周年的时候，朝鲜人民谨向你，斯大林大元帅，致以最热诚的敬意，并为进步人类的福利祝你健康。
