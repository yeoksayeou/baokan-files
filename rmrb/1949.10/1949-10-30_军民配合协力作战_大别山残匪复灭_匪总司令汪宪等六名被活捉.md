　　Military and Civilians Cooperate to Fight Together
    The Remaining Bandits in the Dabie Mountains are Annihilated
    Bandit Commander-in-Chief Wang Xian and Six Others Captured Alive
    [Hubei News] A unit of the People's Liberation Army's bandit suppression forces in the Hubei-Henan-Anhui border area captured bandit leader Wang Xian, commander-in-chief of the pseudo-Hubei-Henan-Anhui Border Region People's Self-Defense Army, and his entourage near Maoding Mountain, south of Jinjiazhai (Lihuang), on the 30th of last month, seizing a radio station. On the same day, in the evening, the same unit captured Yuan Chengying, the second deputy commander and commander of the first detachment of Wang Xian's bandit group, and also the pseudo-Lihuang County Magistrate, in the Shizikou cave on Maoding Mountain. Another PLA unit captured six bandits, including bandit battalion commander Zhang Jiwu and Feng Chunbo, near Lianglukou on September 27, seizing a radio station. On the 2nd of this month, a PLA unit captured Fan Xun, the first deputy commander and chief of staff of Wang Xian's bandit group, and more than ten of his attendants, near Maoding Mountain, seizing one light machine gun. Note: Bandit leader Wang Xian was a trusted henchman of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits. After our Second Field Army transferred from the Dabie Mountains, he was sent to sneak into the mountainous area, using Jinjiazhai as his lair, gathering five to six thousand bandits to carry out sabotage activities. This time, the PLA launched a surprise attack and liberated Jinjiazhai on the 7th of last month, first destroying the bandit lair. Before long, bandit leader Wang Xian and others were captured alive, to the great satisfaction of the people. The remaining bandits in the Dabie Mountains, under the cooperation and joint operations of our military and civilians, are heading towards the fate of annihilation.
    [Another News] After capturing the main bandit leaders Wang Xian and others alive, our army in the Dabie Mountains continued to search and suppress, and recently captured many more important bandit leaders. A company of a certain unit of the Third Field Army captured Ruan Zhiling, commander of the 10th Detachment of the bandit "Hubei-Henan-Anhui People's Self-Defense Army," and three others, including Ruan Shan, platoon leader of his guard platoon, near Jinzhai on the 5th; the 5th company also captured Hong Chongyin, section chief of Wang's bandit headquarters, Wen Yushu, secretary, and Hu Yuanfu, assistant secretary. On the same day, the basic regiment of the Sixth Anhui Military Sub-district searched and suppressed bandits in the Yufutan area of Jinzhai County, capturing Wang Weichu, the regimental chief of staff of Huang Ying's unit, the first detachment of the bandit "Hubei-Henan-Anhui People's Self-Defense Army." In one day, nine bandit detachment commanders, regimental chiefs of staff, section chiefs, etc., were captured alive, seizing one Thompson submachine gun, one light machine gun, and nine rifles.
    [Another News] Zhang Tianhe, commander of the 6th Detachment of the bandit "Hubei-Henan-Anhui People's Self-Defense Army" and concurrently the joint defense commander of the three counties of pseudo-Lihuang, Gushi, and Shangcheng, was captured by us on the 8th of this month and died of serious injuries. Chen Xinmin, commander of the 11th Detachment of the bandit "Hubei-Henan-Anhui People's Self-Defense Army," and Ye Fan, chief of staff of the detachment and concurrently the pseudo-Luotian County Magistrate, encountered a certain team of our Hubei-Henan-Anhui Southern Line Bandit Suppression Forces near Bijiashan in Luoying County, Hubei on the 11th of this month, and were captured alive by us, seizing one submachine gun and one Mauser pistol. Peng Wen＠, commander of the Shu (cheng) Liu (an) Huo (shan) Qian (shan) Yuexi Five-County Command Post of the bandits, surrendered to a certain unit of ours on the 15th of this month.
