　　Speech by Vice Chairman Zhu De at the China Conference for the Defence of World Peace

　　The China Conference for the Defence of World Peace, established today, is for the purpose of effectively organizing the Chinese people, and joining the peace forces of all countries in the world, to oppose the threat to peace created by the warmongers.

　　After the Second World War, American imperialism replaced the position of fascist Germany, Italy, and Japan, gathered reactionary forces from various countries, organized a reactionary imperialist camp, and frantically prepared for a new war, threatening world peace. This fact reflects the extreme corruption of the capitalist world and the terror of approaching death. U.S. imperialism and its running dogs in various countries are the common enemies of all peace-loving people in the world. All peace-loving people in the world must unite, must form a united front headed by the Soviet Union against imperialism, defeat the reactionary plans of the warmongers, and prevent the occurrence of a third world war.

　　The struggle of the Chinese people against the aggressors and their running dogs has the same goal as the struggle of the people of the world against the instigators of war. For several years, U.S. imperialism has supported its Chinese running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique, in all aspects. However, the Chinese people have used their own heroic and unyielding struggle to victoriously overthrow the reactionaries, achieved China's independence and liberation, and completely bankrupted the U.S. imperialist plan to invade China. This is a victory for the Chinese people and a victory for the people of the world and the world's peace forces. This great victory of the Chinese people demonstrates to the people of the world the truth that the seemingly powerful imperialist camp is actually extremely weak. As long as the people unite, the imperialists' aggressive war plans can be completely shattered.

　　The convocation of the China Conference for the Defence of World Peace indicates that the Chinese people are determined to organize and fight to defend world peace. Article 11 of the Common Program formulated by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and accepted by the Central People's Government stipulates: "The People's Republic of China unites with all peace-loving and freedom-loving countries and peoples in the world, first of all the Soviet Union, the people's democracies, and all oppressed nations, standing on the side of the international peace and democracy camp, jointly opposing imperialist aggression, in order to safeguard lasting world peace." The Central People's Government must strive to follow this policy. The establishment of the China Conference for the Defence of World Peace will use the strength of the masses to help the Central People's Government to fully implement this policy.

　　We are very pleased that the convocation of the China Conference for the Defence of World Peace has been attended by a delegation of Soviet literary, artistic, and scientific workers headed by Mr. Fadeyev, Italian Senator Spano, and a Korean delegation. This shows that our struggle is not isolated, and we have extensive international friends. In the struggle for world peace, I believe that the Chinese people will certainly be able to unite with the people of all countries in the world and advance hand in hand.

　　Long live world peace!
　　Long live the China Conference for the Defence of World Peace!

　　中国保卫世界和平大会上
   　朱德副主席演说词
    【新华社北京三日电】朱德副主席在中国保卫世界和平大会成立大会上演说词全文如下：
    今天成立的中国保卫世界和平大会，是为了有效地组织中国人民，和世界一切国家的和平力量一道，反对战争贩子们所造成的对于和平的威胁。
    在第二次世界大战之后，帝国主义的美国代替了法西斯德、意、日的地位，集合了各国反动势力，组织帝国主义的反动阵营，疯狂地准备新的战争，威胁全世界的和平。——这个事实，反映了资本主义世界的极端腐败和接近死亡的恐怖情绪。美帝国主义及其在各国的走狗们，是全世界爱好和平的人们的共同敌人，全世界一切爱好和平的人们必须团结起来，必须组成以苏联为首的反对帝国主义的统一战线，打败战争阴谋家的反动计划，阻止第三次世界大战的发生。
    中国人民反对侵略者及其走狗的斗争，和世界人民反对战争挑拨者的斗争，目标是一致的。几年以来，美帝国主义曾经在各个方面支持了它的中国走狗蒋介石反动集团，但是中国人民已经用自己英勇的不屈不挠的斗争，胜利地打倒了反动派，取得了中国的独立与解放，使得美帝国主义侵略中国的计划完全破产。这是中国人民的胜利，也是世界人民和世界和平力量的胜利。中国人民的这个伟大胜利，向全世界人民说明了这样的真理：外貌强大的帝国主义阵营，实际上是极其虚弱的，只要人民团结起来，帝国主义者的侵略战争计划，是完全能够打碎的。
    中国保卫世界和平大会的召集，表示中国人民决心组织起来，为保卫世界和平而奋斗。在中国人民政治协商会议所制定而为中央人民政府所接受的共同纲领第十一条上规定：“中华人民共和国联合世界上一切爱好和平自由的国家和人民，首先是苏联，各人民民主国家和各被压迫民族，站在国际和平民主阵营方面，共同反对帝国主义侵略，以保障世界的持久和平。”中央人民政府一定要按照这个方针来奋斗。中国保卫世界和平大会的成立，将用群众力量帮助中央人民政府来完满地实行这个方针。
    中国保卫世界和平大会的召集，得到以法捷耶夫先生为首的苏联文学艺术科学工作者代表团、意大利参议员斯巴诺先生和朝鲜代表团的参加，我们表示十分高兴。这是表示我们的斗争不是孤立的，我们有广大的国际友人。在为世界和平的斗争中，我相信中国人民一定能和世界各国人民团结一致，携手并进。
    世界和平万岁！
    中国保卫世界和平大会万岁！
