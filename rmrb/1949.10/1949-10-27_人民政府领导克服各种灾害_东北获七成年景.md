Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 26th. The autumn harvest in Northeast China has basically ended, and various places are now successively entering the threshing, seed selection, and organization of sideline production. This year, due to earlier planting and the widespread suffering of floods, droughts, and other disasters since summer and autumn, the harvesting work was earlier than in previous years. In the northernmost Heilongjiang Province, where the season is later, more than 34 million mu of farmland (sorghum, corn, millet, etc.) were harvested around the beginning of this month, and the Heihe area on the northern border also ended in the first half of the month. As of the beginning of this month, Songjiang Province has harvested more than two-thirds of its crops, and the remaining crops are being rushed to harvest. The autumn harvest in Rehe Province was half a month earlier this year, and it was generally on the field before the middle of the month, with some already in storage. The Lushun-Dalian area completed all harvesting at the end of September. According to the current situation in various provinces, it is expected that threshing will be completed by the end of this month in general areas.

Thanks to the active leadership of governments at all levels and the Communist Party committees, as well as the efforts of the masses of farmers, various disasters have been overcome and reduced. According to estimates by the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Northeast People's Government, the average harvest in the entire region will be nearly 70%. Liaoxi Province, which was more severely affected by disasters, also harvested about 60%, and Songjiang Province about 50%. During each season, various places paid attention to giving full play to the role of labor mutual aid organizations and female labor. Heilongjiang Province focused on consolidating mutual aid groups that had disbanded during summer hoeing, which played a significant role. In Tailai County, only 1,540 mutual aid groups remained during summer hoeing, but during the autumn harvest, they were restored and developed to 1,704, and 210 women's groups were organized, mobilizing more than 5,300 women (59% of the county's rural female labor force) to go to the fields to harvest more than 30,000 mu. In Xinglong County, Rehe Province, more than 2,300 labor exchange groups carried out harvesting, and in Fengning County, those participating in labor exchange groups for autumn harvesting accounted for more than 80% of the county's labor force, and more than 80% of the female labor force also participated in the autumn harvest. In the Third District of Chengde County, 1,230 women harvested one-fifth of the district's more than 30,000 mu of land.

Due to insufficient seed selection last year, many crops did not produce solid grains. This year, various places have attached importance to seed selection, and have paid special attention to the selection of seeds for cash crops such as soybeans and wheat, so that the seeds will be solid and meet trade specifications next year. The Songjiang Provincial Government's Department of Agriculture has sent more than 30 students from agricultural colleges to help farmers select more than 3,000 mu of excellent soybean seeds. Counties and districts in Heilongjiang Province have organized seed selection committees at the district and village levels to evaluate the quality of varieties and organize farmers to exchange them. Liaodong, Liaoxi, Rehe and other provinces have universally organized "field seed selection," which has also achieved good results. Many areas, while harvesting, are also organizing sideline production and autumn plowing to overcome the difficulties of this year's disaster and prepare for next year's major production. According to incomplete statistics from more than a dozen counties such as Keshan and Lanxi in Heilongjiang Province in the past month, about 90,000 farmers have been organized to participate in sideline production. In Fuxin County, Liaoxi Province, 7,000 to 8,000 people participate in panning for gold every day, earning 2,000 dan of grain in the first half of September alone. Currently, various places are organizing threshing while continuing to develop sideline production.

　　人民政府领导克服各种灾害　
    东北获七成年景
    【新华社沈阳二十六日电】东北各地秋收已基本上结束，现正纷纷进入打尝选种和组织副业生产。今年各地由于播种较早。加之夏秋以来普遍遭受水旱等灾，故收割工作比往年提前。季节较晚的北满黑龙江省，于本月上旬前后即已割完三千四百余万亩大田（高粱、玉米、谷子等），极北边境黑河地区，亦于上半月结束。松江省截至本月上旬止，已收割庄稼三分之二以上，其余庄稼正在抢收中。热河省今年秋收提早半月，中旬前已普遍上场，并有部分入仓。旅大地区则在九月底全部收割完毕。据目前各省情况估计，一般地区可望在本月底完成打场工作。
    由于各级政府和中共党委的积极领导，以及农民群众的努力，各种灾害已经克服和减少了。据东北人民政府农林部估计，全境收成平均将近七成。受灾较重的辽西省亦约收六成，松江省约有五成。在各个季节中，各地注意了发挥劳动互助组织和妇女劳动力的作用。黑龙江省在夏锄期间有重点地整顿已散伙的互助小组，起了很大作用。泰来县夏锄时仅剩一千五百四十个互助小组，秋收中又恢复和发展到一千七百零四个，并组织了妇女小组二百一十个，动员五千三百余名妇女（占全县农村妇女劳动力百分之五十九）下地，收割三万余亩。热河省兴隆县有二千三百多个换工小组进行收割，丰宁县参加换工组进行秋收的占全县劳动力百分之八十以上，参加秋收的妇女劳动力亦有百分之八十以上。承德县三区一千二百三十名妇女，收割了全区三万余亩土地的五分之一。
    各地因去年选种不够，庄稼籽粒不成实的不少。今年各地都重视选种工作，并特别注意大豆、小麦等商品作物籽种的选择，以使来年结实符合于贸易规格。松江省政府农业厅已派出农业专门学校学生三十余名，帮助农民选出优良大豆种三千余亩。黑龙江省各县区组织了区村两级选种委员会，评议品种优劣，组织农民串换。辽东、辽西、热河等省普遍地组织“田间选种”，亦获较好效果。不少地区在秋收同时，即结合组织副业生产与秋耕地等工作，以克服今年灾荒困难和准备明年的大生产。据黑龙江省克山、兰西等十三县一个多月来的不完全统计，有组织参加副业生产的农民约九万人。辽西省阜新县每日有七、八千人参加淘金，仅九月上半月即收入两千石粮。现各地正一面组织打场，一面继续开展副业生产。
