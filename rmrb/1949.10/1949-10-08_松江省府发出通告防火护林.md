The Songjiang Provincial Government Issues Notice
　　Fire Prevention and Forest Protection
　　[Report from this newspaper's Northeast Correspondent] With the arrival of late autumn, grasses and trees are withering. To prevent forest fires and protect forests, the Songjiang Provincial People's Government issued a notice on fire prevention and forest protection in September to protect state property. It is reported that a forest fire occurred in the Dongning forest area of the province on July 6th, which burned for 48 consecutive days, destroying approximately 10,000 cubic meters of timber and an area of 20,000 hectares. In the Muleng forest area, there were 15 fires in July and August, burning nearly 10,000 hectares, causing significant losses to state property. Now that the fire prevention season has arrived, lax management in mountainous areas with large populations will inevitably lead to fires. The Songjiang Provincial People's Government has issued interim measures for fire prevention and forest protection, deciding to establish fire prevention organizations in forest area counties, delineate fire prevention zones, and requiring governments at all levels to cooperate with this work during the spring and autumn fire prevention seasons, conducting in-depth publicity and mobilization, launching mass fire prevention campaigns, and implementing strict inspections in fire prevention zones, strictly prohibiting hunting in the mountains. Those without certificates from the fire prevention committee are not allowed to enter the mountains. If anyone illegally enters the mountains or damages the forests, they may be arrested on the spot and handed over to the government for legal action. To reward those who have made meritorious contributions to forest protection, it is stipulated that if no forest fire occurs in a county for half a year, no forest fire occurs in a district for one year, or no forest fire occurs in a village for two years, the provincial government will issue a commendation order as a reward.

　　松江省府发出通告
    防火护林
    【本报东北讯】深秋即届，草木枯萎，为防止山火，保护森林，松江省人民政府于九月份即发出防火护林通告，以保护国家资财。按该省东宁林区于七月六日发生山火，大火连烧四十八天，烧毁林木约一万立方米，面积达两万垧。穆棱林区在七、八两月中起火十五次，燃烧面积也近万垧，使国家财产受了重大损失。现防火季节已到，如在群众多的山区疏于管理，势必易引火灾。松江省人民政府特颁发防火护林暂行办法，决定在各林区县份设立防火组织，划出防火地带，在春秋防火季节，各级政府都要配合这一工作，进行深入宣传动员，开展群众性防火运动，并在防火地带实行严格检查，严禁入山狩猎，没有防火委员会证明者不得入山，如若非法入山，破坏森林，可就地拘捕，送交政府依法处理。为奖励护林有功者，并规定一县范围内半年不起山火，一区内一年不起山火，一村内二年不起山火者，由省府通令奖励。
