[Our Newspaper's Report] The All-China Federation of Literary Workers yesterday (the 10th) hosted a banquet for Fadeyev, the General Secretary of the Soviet Writers' Union.

The atmosphere was warm and joyful. Comrade Fadeyev listened very attentively and answered every question raised by the Chinese writers in detail and vividly. He expressed great concern for the issues in Chinese literature and earnestly invited Chinese literary workers to come to the Soviet Union to help translate Chinese literary works into Russian and other languages, spreading them to the world.
　　　　Simonov: Introduces Soviet Experience in Drama Work

[Our Newspaper's Report] Simonov, the Deputy Head of the Soviet Cultural, Artistic, and Scientific Workers Delegation, discussed issues related to Chinese and Soviet drama work yesterday (the 10th) with the All-China Drama Workers Association. Writers, directors, and actors from the national opera and spoken drama circles attended. After Tian Han, the Chairman of the All-China Drama Workers Association, delivered a welcoming speech, Simonov provided very profound and vivid answers to the questions raised by those present. When discussing how to treat classical drama, he said that for past classical art, we should critically absorb its essence and never discard it entirely. When asked for his opinion on Chinese drama, he greatly praised the old Chinese opera, saying that in this vast sea of old typical art, there are extremely rich treasures for us to discover. When talking about how to cultivate drama experts, he introduced the Soviet state's emphasis on this work and its experiences, saying that they have specialized institutions responsible for promoting it. When asked about his creation of "The Russian Question," he said that in America, he learned what kind of people American journalists are, how they work, who are our friends or enemies, and they have various different views on the Soviet Union. These views can be clearly divided into progressive and reactionary boundaries, so it is our responsibility to inform the people of this situation. Every time Simonov answered a question, the audience burst into applause. Tian Han said in his thank-you speech: "Our dearest friend Simonov has given us so many valuable instructions, for which every drama worker is extremely grateful."

　　　　Gerasimov and Others Express: To Film the Great Victory of the Chinese People

[Our Newspaper's Report] The All-China Film Art Workers Association, the Central Film Bureau, and the Beijing Film Studio jointly hosted a banquet yesterday afternoon (the 10th) at the Beijing Film Studio for all the film worker representatives of the Soviet Cultural, Artistic, and Scientific Delegation. Those present included the famous Soviet director Gerasimov, Varlamov, as well as renowned producers, cinematographers, and twenty-five others. Those accompanying them included Yuan Muzhi, Director of the Central Film Bureau, Yang Hansheng, Chairman of the All-China Film Art Workers Association, Deputy Director Cai Chusheng, and more than thirty Chinese film workers. The atmosphere was filled with the high friendship between Chinese and Soviet film workers, expressing boundless confidence in the future of cooperation in progressive art between the two countries. Yuan Muzhi, Yang Hansheng, and Cai Chusheng stated: "China's progressive film industry has learned from the Soviet Union in the past. In the future, we will be able to learn directly from Soviet comrades, and we feel even more excited." Gerasimov and Varlamov also expressed that they would film the great victory of the Chinese people so that the Soviet people and the people of the world can see it with their own eyes. Chinese and Soviet film workers frequently raised their glasses to wish each other good health and repeatedly toasted the great people's leaders of the two countries, Stalin and Mao Zedong.

At 3:15 p.m., a welcome meeting was held. Chairman Yuan Muzhi introduced the Soviet film workers to all the staff of the Beijing Film Studio. He said: "The Soviet film crew has come to China three times. The first time was during the Great Revolution, the second time was in the early days of the War of Resistance, and this is the third time, when the Chinese People's Liberation War has basically achieved victory and the People's Republic of China has been established. From this, it can be seen that every time Soviet photography comrades come to China, it is a time when the Chinese revolution is surging forward. The period during which Soviet photography comrades could not come to China was when the revolution suffered setbacks and the Kuomintang reactionaries were rampant. Now that the Kuomintang reactionaries who hinder the friendship and cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet peoples have been overthrown, Soviet photography comrades can come to China at any time. The film workers of China and the Soviet Union can from now on cooperate directly for a long time and permanently. This time, the Soviet photography team, under the order of Comrade Stalin, temporarily put aside their work in their own country and came to China to shoot two color films reflecting the heroic struggle of the Chinese people. This is the beginning of direct cooperation between the film workers of China and the Soviet Union. We must learn from the internationalist spirit of the Soviet comrades and do everything possible to help them so that they can complete this task well." Then, Gerasimov, the famous director of the film "The Young Guard," delivered a speech, saying that the Chinese people's victory in the struggle against domestic reactionaries and foreign imperialism made the Soviet people happy and inspired. "We hope to make the greatest efforts to ensure that these two films reflecting the heroic struggle of the Chinese people can reach the highest level and can be produced as soon as possible, because this is not only what the Soviet people desire, but also what the people of the world desire." Next, Varlamov, the famous director of the film "Stalingrad," delivered a speech. When talking about Soviet news documentaries, Varlamov said: "The task of our Soviet news documentaries is to reflect the economic, cultural, and scientific construction of the world's first socialist country. The Soviet audience is very satisfied with these films because they see themselves in these films. During the Soviet-German War, many Soviet cinematographers volunteered to go to the front lines and participate in the war to defend the socialist motherland together with the soldiers. Because of such efforts, ten films were made, reflecting the victory of not only the Soviet Union but also various European countries in being liberated from the fascist bandit forces. With the help of the Chinese People's Government and film workers, we believe that we will definitely be able to faithfully reflect the heroic struggle of the Chinese people." After the meeting, they visited the Beijing Film Studio and screened the two films "Three Years of Liberation War in Northeast" and "Million-Strong Army Crosses the Yangtze River."

    　　　　格拉西莫夫等表示：要把中国人民的伟大胜利摄成电影
    【本报讯】中华全国电影艺术工作者协会、中央电影管理局与北京电影制片厂昨天（十日）下午在北京电影制片厂联合欢宴苏联文化艺术科学代表团全体电影工作者代表。出席者有苏联名导演格拉西莫夫、华尔拉莫夫以及著名的制片家、摄影师等二十五人，作陪者有中央电影管理局局长袁牧之、中华全国电影艺术工作者协会主席阳翰笙、副主任蔡楚生及中国电影工作者三十余人。席间洋溢着中苏两国电影工作者的高度友情，对两国进步艺术的合作前途表示无限的信心。袁牧之、阳翰笙、蔡楚生表示：“中国的进步电影界过去就是向苏联学习的，今后我们更能直接向苏联同志学习，我们觉得愈加兴奋。”格拉西莫夫、华尔拉莫夫亦表示要把中国人民的伟大胜利摄成电影，让苏联人民以及全世界人民能亲眼看到。中苏两国电影工作者频频举杯互祝健康，并数次为两国伟大的人民领袖斯大林、毛泽东干杯。
    下午三点一刻开欢迎大会，主席袁牧之介绍苏联电影工作者与全体北京电影制片厂工作人员见面，他说：“苏联摄影队到中国来前后已有三次，第一次在大革命时代，第二次在抗战初期，这回是第三次，是在中国解放战争基本上已获得胜利，中华人民共和国已经成立的时候，从这里可看出，每次苏联摄影同志到中国来，都是中国革命形势高涨的时候，苏联摄影同志不能到中国来的期间，都是革命遭到挫折，国民党反动派猖獗的时候。现在阻碍中苏两国人民友谊合作的国民党反动派已经打倒，苏联摄影同志可以随时到中国来，中苏两国的电影工作者从此可以长期地、永久地，直接合作下去。这次苏联摄影队奉斯大林同志的命令暂时放下了他们在本国的工作，到中国来拍摄两部反映中国人民英勇斗争的五彩影片，是中苏两国电影工作者直接合作的开端，我们要学习苏联同志这种国际主义的精神，尽一切力量帮助他们，使他们能很好完成这个任务。”接着由著名的“青年近卫军”影片导演格拉西莫夫致辞：他表示中国人民对国内反动派与国外帝国主义的斗争胜利，使苏联人民欢欣鼓舞。“我们希望以最大努力，使这两部反映中国人民的英勇斗争的影片能达到最高水平，并能尽快的制作出来，因为这不但是苏联人民所渴望的，而且也是全世界人民所渴望的。”其次由著名的“史太林格拉”影片导演华尔拉莫夫致辞：华尔拉莫夫在谈到苏联的新闻记录片时说：“我们苏联的新闻记录片的任务，是要反映这全世界第一个社会主义国家的经济、文化、科学各方面的建设工作。苏联的观众对这些片子很满意，因为他们从这些影片中看到了自己。在苏德战争时，许多苏联摄影师自告奋勇到前线去，与战士们一道参加保卫社会主义祖国的战争，由于这样的努力，摄成了十部片子，反映了不但苏联，而且是欧洲各国从法西斯强盗势力下解放的胜利。在中国人民政府及电影工作者的帮助下，我们相信一定能够把中国人民的英勇斗争忠实地反映出来。”会后参观北京电影制片厂，并放映“东北三年解放战争”及“百万雄师下江南”两部影片。
