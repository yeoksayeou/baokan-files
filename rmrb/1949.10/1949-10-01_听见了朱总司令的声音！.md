　　Heard Commander-in-Chief Zhu's Voice!
　　　　A Soldier of the Tank Regiment

　　We only have one radio here, and these days we have a lot of patrons; a room ten meters long and five meters wide is packed to the gills.
　　Everyone said that they had already heard Chairman Mao's speech twice the day before yesterday. What is Commander-in-Chief Zhu going to say today? Looking at the watch, there are only ten minutes left until the Xinhua Broadcasting Station's scheduled time. Everyone is concerned: there are nine minutes left, five minutes, almost there, three minutes, two minutes, one minute, half a minute, why isn't it here yet? Everyone is waiting, waiting for the voice of our Commander-in-Chief.
　　After a burst of warm applause, the speech began, but then there was continuous applause, interrupting the speech. Finally, when the applause subsided, your voice was so loud, every word and every sentence struck our hearts.
　　"...I guarantee to everyone that the revolution will be carried through to the end, liberating all of China's territory..." At this moment, the air in this room was so tense, just like before a battle, when the commander announced the order in front of the ranks.
　　"The People's Liberation Army, defends China's independence and territorial sovereignty... defends... defends..." Everyone's hearts beat even more excitedly.
　　"Strengthen the modern army, build the air force and navy..." Like a flash of lightning, I thought of the movie I saw a few days ago: "The Soviet Victory Parade." In the future, we—now already starting—will be just as powerful as in that movie.
　　"...We must establish a unified, modernized, politically strong people's powerful army to serve the people..." This is such a powerful voice, just as Chairman Mao said: "Let the reactionaries tremble!"
　　The assembly whistle sounded outside, and everyone rushed out and lined up. Some people were still whispering, "Modernization... regularization... powerful... every inch of land."
　　Sleeping at night, the next day, and up to now, your voice has always been echoing in our hearts, "Modernization... powerful... every inch of land." How excited we are! This is the great order given to us by our Commander-in-Chief, and it is also a solemn oath on behalf of us before the people.
　　Now we are starting, intensifying our study of military affairs and technology, mastering modern weapons, and becoming a modern and powerful national defense force to defend every inch of our great motherland. Whoever dares to invade, as long as the Commander-in-Chief gives an order, we guarantee to smash them to pieces!

　　听见了朱总司令的声音！
    战车团一卒
    我们这里仅有一台收音机，这几天主顾特别多，一间十米长五米宽的房间挤得水泄不通。
    大家都说前天毛主席讲演已经听了二次，今天朱总司令又不知说什么呢？看着表，距新华广播电台预告时间只差十分钟了。大家关心着：还有九分钟，五分钟，快了，三分，二分，一分，半分，怎么还没有来，大家都在等着，等着我们总司令的声音。
    火火地一阵掌声过后，讲话开始了，但接着又是不断的掌声，打断了讲话。好容易掌声平息了，你的声音多么响亮，每一字每一句，都打在我们的心中。
    “……我向大家保证把革命进行到底，解放全中国领土，……”这时这房子里的空气多么紧张，正象在战斗之前，首长在队列前宣布命令一样。
    “人民解放军，保卫中国独立和领土主权完整……保卫……保卫……”大家的心更加兴奋地跳动着。
    “加强现代化的陆军，建设空军和海军……”在我脑中象闪电似的想到前些日，看的电影：“苏联胜利大检阅”，我们将来——现在已经开始，要和那电影上一样，一样的强大。
    “……一定要建立一支统一，现代化，政治上坚强的为人民服务的人民强大军队……”这是多么有力量的声音，正如毛主席所说：“让反动派发抖吧！”
    外面的集合哨音响了，大家一拥而出一直排好队，还有人在小声说“现代化……正规化……强大……一寸土”。
    晚上睡觉，第二天，一直到现在，你的声音，始终在我们心中响着，“现代化……强大……一寸土”，我们是多么兴奋啊！这是我们的总司令给我们的伟大的命令，也是代表我们在人民面前庄严的宣誓。
    现在我们即开始了，加紧的学习军事，技术，掌握现代化的武器，成为一支近代化的强大的国防军，来保卫我们伟大的祖国的一寸土。谁敢来犯，只要总司令一声号令，我们保证打得他稀烂粉碎！
