　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 28th. Agence Telegraphique Est-Européenne, Paris, October 26th: The French people are actively supporting the American Communist leaders persecuted by the American reactionaries, and a committee to protect the American Communist leaders has been formed, headed by the famous writer Paul Éluard. The committee calls on all French men and women to protest to the U.S. Embassy in Paris against the vicious verdicts of the American reactionaries against the great warriors of the United States who are fighting for peace and democracy.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 28th. TASS, New York, October 25th: Many well-known artists, writers, educators, and other figures have jointly written to Attorney General McGrath, requesting bail for the eleven Communist leaders while they appeal to a higher court. Signatories include playwrights Chodorov and Ward, artists Kent and Evergood, lawyers Pomerantz and former Assistant Attorney General Rogge, historian Du Bois, and others.
　　The Communist Party headquarters is currently receiving donations from all over the country to maintain the persecuted Communist leaders. The Workers' Daily announced that since the sentencing, more than $63,000 in donations have been received from areas outside New York State. The weekly magazine of the Hotel Employees Union of New York, affiliated with the American Federation of Labor (which has 30,000 members), warned in an editorial that attacks on the Communist Party are attacks on the democratic rights of all workers. The editorial called on American workers to fight against the persecution of Communist leaders. The editorial stated: "Unless the reactionaries' attack is defeated, the achievements gained by the trade union movement through years of hard struggle will be reduced to nothing."
　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 28th. TASS, Stockholm, October 24th: The national congress of the Swedish progressive student group "Clarté" protested to the U.S. Embassy in Stockholm against the U.S. court's verdict against the American Communist leaders. The protest stated that this sentencing violated the constitutional freedoms and democratic rights of the American people, and emphasized that the American reactionaries are taking fascist means to suppress the labor movement.
