Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 28th: Autumn plowing and sowing has been basically completed in various parts of Shandong Province. As early as July this year, the Shandong Branch of the Chinese Communist Party mobilized the entire party to do a good job in autumn plowing and sowing, and all localities formulated specific wheat planting plans based on local conditions. Last year, the spread of wheat smut disease in the Shandong area reached 32 counties, with diseased plants accounting for 30% to 80%, resulting in significant yield reductions and seriously affecting the production morale of farmers in the affected areas. Before wheat sowing, the Shandong Provincial People's Government exchanged or loaned 21 million jin of disease-free wheat seeds to farmers in areas affected by wheat smut and those lacking seeds. The people's governments and farms in the wheat smut-affected areas also trained a large number of cadres with knowledge of wheat smut prevention and control to guide the masses in seed soaking and replacement, improve fertilization methods, and promote superior varieties. Local governments and cooperatives also sold or loaned large quantities of disease-free wheat seeds and disease-free fertilizer to farmers. The Bohai Administrative Office alone transferred 5 million jin of soybean cake and 2 million jin of manure to the Qinghe Special District. After the more than 10 million mu of land flooded by continuous autumn rains were drained and rescued through the efforts of party, government, military and civilians, most of the land, except for a small part where water remained stagnant in low-lying areas, was able to be planted with wheat. In the Cangnan Special District of Bohai, which was most severely affected by the floods, wheat planting also reached 50% of the cultivated land area. For the land of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, and workers without labor in the old areas of the province, the method of fixed substitute farming was largely implemented, ensuring that agricultural timing was not missed. The military dependents in various counties of the Luzhongnan District not only generally ensured the timely completion of autumn plowing and sowing, but some places even completed it earlier than the average farmer. Thanks to overcoming the seed shortage and carrying out drainage for wheat planting, autumn plowing and sowing throughout the province was basically completed by mid-October.
    [Report from this newspaper] According to Xinhua News Agency Jinan: Under the leadership of people's governments at all levels and the CCP party committees, peasants in Shandong province have vigorously overcome drought, hail, pests, floods, typhoons and other disasters, and achieved an average of 60% yield for the autumn harvest.
    However, the grain shortage in Shandong this winter and next spring is still serious. Currently, farmers in various regions are actively engaged in sideline production and are launching a movement to save and prepare for famine.

　　山东人民政府领导及时　
    完成秋耕秋种　
    战胜灾害秋收六成
    【新华社济南二十八日电】山东省各地秋耕秋种已基本完成。早在今年七月，中共山东分局即动员全党做好秋耕、秋种工作，各地均根据当地情况订出具体的种麦计划。由于去年山东地区乌麦病蔓延达三十二县，病株占百分之三十至八十，减产甚巨，严重影响患地农民的生产情绪。山东省人民政府于麦种前，即以二千一百万斤无病麦种兑换或贷给患乌麦地区及缺种籽地区的农民。患乌麦地区的人民政府与农场并训练了大批具有防除乌麦知识的干部指导群众浸种换种，改良施肥方法，推广优良品种。各地政府及合作社亦大量以无病麦种、无病菌肥料，售予或贷给农民，仅渤海区行政公署即向清河专区调运豆饼五百万斤，大粪二百万斤。因秋雨连绵被淹之千余万亩土地，经党政军民努力排水抢救后，现除一小部分因低洼积水未退外，大部均能种上麦子。受水灾最重的渤海沧南专区种麦亦达到占耕种土地面积百分之五十。对于全省老区无劳动力的烈、军、工属土地，大部实行了固定代耕的办法，都能作到不违农时。鲁中南区各县军属不但一般保证了秋耕秋种及时完成，且有的地方早于一般农民。由于克服了种子困难和进行排水种麦，全省秋耕秋种至本月中旬已基本完成。
    【本报讯】据新华社济南电：山东省各地农民在各级人民政府和中共党委领导下，大力克服了旱、雹、虫、水、台风等灾害，获得平均六成年景的秋收。
    但山东今冬明春粮荒仍重，现各地农民正积极从事副业生产，并展开节约备荒运动。
