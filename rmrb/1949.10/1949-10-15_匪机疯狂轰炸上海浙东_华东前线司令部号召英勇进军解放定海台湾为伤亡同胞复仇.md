Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 14th—The Kuomintang bandit gang's remnant forces are conducting inhumane bombing of Shanghai and eastern Zhejiang, causing huge casualties to residents. At 2:00 PM on the 13th of this month, a bandit plane indiscriminately bombed the vicinity of the Shiliupu Wharf, a densely populated area in Shanghai, killing 38 civilians and wounding about 70, destroying 15 shanties and one store. Currently, the Yu Temple District Public Security Bureau and the takeover committee are assisting the affected residents in handling the aftermath and preparing food for relief. Prior to this, Kuomintang bandit planes had continuously indiscriminately bombed Ningbo, Zhenhai, Daxie Island, Dagang Town and other places in eastern Zhejiang in mid-September. On September 12th, two to four bandit planes bombed Zhenhai city as many as 13 times in shifts, dropping more than 100 bombs, killing and wounding more than 100 people. Dagang Island, a coastal town of Zhenhai, was continuously bombed by bandit planes and has become a scorched earth. In Guanwai Village on Daxie Island, only eight households remain out of 140 households. Since September 13th, Ningbo City has been continuously bombed by bandit planes. From 8:00 AM on the 20th, six bandit planes, including P-25, P-51, and B-26, furiously bombed the urban area in shifts for up to 13 hours, dropping multiple bombs and incendiary bombs, causing a major fire in the urban area. After the fire broke out, the bandit planes continued their bestial acts by frantically strafing and bombing the firefighters, making it impossible to control the fire. Nearly one-half of the essence of the city's Jiangdong District, the Lingqiao along the river, and the commercial districts of yarn shops, north-south goods shops, dyeing workshops, department stores, pharmacies, and money houses in the downtown area were tragically destroyed. Regarding this bestial act of bandit planes slaughtering the people, the spokesperson of the East China Frontline Command of the People's Liberation Army issued a statement calling on the People's Liberation Army to heroically advance, liberate Dinghai and Taiwan, and annihilate the remaining bandits at sea, to avenge the compatriots who were killed and wounded in the indiscriminate bombing by bandit planes.
