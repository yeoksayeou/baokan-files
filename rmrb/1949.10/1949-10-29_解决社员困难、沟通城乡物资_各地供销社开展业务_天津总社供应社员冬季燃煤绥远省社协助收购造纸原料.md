Solving Members' Difficulties, Connecting Urban and Rural Materials
	Supply and Marketing Cooperatives in Various Regions Carry Out Business
	Tianjin General Cooperative Supplies Winter Coal to Members; Suiyuan Provincial Cooperative Assists in Purchasing Papermaking Raw Materials
[Report from this newspaper] Recently, supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions have actively carried out business, timely solving members' difficulties and achieving certain results in serving urban and rural trade. The Tianjin Supply and Marketing Cooperative General Office, in order to meet seasonal needs, supplies coal to its members. Recently, it has entered into a coal supply agreement with the North China Coal and Iron Company. It was decided that the Coal and Iron Company would supply the General Office with 11,740 tons of coal, to be delivered and paid for in batches at different times and locations. In order to simplify procedures, the cooperative members in Tianjin were organized into 30 units, and special personnel were selected to be responsible for receiving coal and collecting payments. The coal price is 3% lower than the market price on the day the members pay. It is estimated that the coal supplied will be sufficient for the city's members for three months. In addition to organizing the production of more than 4,000 finished woolen autumn shirts, nearly 8,000 various kinds of wool sweaters and pants, and a large number of towels, men's socks, white twill cloth, and white city cloth in September, all of which were contracted out to department stores for sales. Recently, in order to meet consumer needs, the department store delivered 700 pounds of "Antelope" brand wool yarn to the cooperative's production department in early October to organize a large number of housewives to knit sweaters.

	Moreover, the Changlu Salt Industry Company has been promoting the sale of salt in various regions. Since establishing business relations with the cooperatives, sales have increased significantly. For example, the Baoding branch directly contacted the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative, and salt sales increased sharply from more than 400 dan in August to more than 3,000 dan in September. In the first ten days of October alone, more than 8,000 dan were sold, accounting for more than 55% of the branch's total salt sales. The Shijiazhuang branch also sold more than 22,000 dan of salt to the Municipal General Cooperative and various county cooperatives in August and September, accounting for more than 65% of its total sales. The Beijing branch, in conjunction with the Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative, comprehensively supplied edible salt to the city.

	Furthermore, when the Tianjin Papermaking Industry Raw Material Inspection Team purchased hemp stalks as papermaking raw materials in Suiyuan, they received assistance from the Suiyuan Provincial Cooperative General Office, which greatly facilitated the purchasing work. The cooperative used its convenient connections with various county cooperatives to issue notices stating that hemp stalks could be used for papermaking and were good industrial raw materials, telling farmers to pay attention to preserving them and that they could be directly exchanged for native cloth, cotton, etc. when purchasing; at the same time, it encouraged farmers to plant more hemp. According to the investigation by the Raw Material Inspection Team, a total of 1.4 million mu of hemp were planted in Jining, Fengzhen, Longsheng, Xinghe, Taolin, Liangcheng and other counties in eastern Suiyuan, which can produce more than 110 million jin of hemp stalks. This shows that supply and marketing cooperatives are playing a significant role in promoting the welfare of members, organizing mass production, and connecting urban and rural trade.

　　解决社员困难、沟通城乡物资　
    各地供销社开展业务           
    天津总社供应社员冬季燃煤绥远省社协助收购造纸原料
    【本报讯】近来各地供销社积极开展业务，及时解决社员困难，为城乡贸易服务获得一定成绩。天津供销合作总社为适应季节需要，供应社员燃煤，最近已和华北煤铁公司订立了供煤协议。决定由煤铁公司供给总社煤斤一万一千七百四十吨，分时分地分批交煤付款。该社为了简便手续，将津市各合作社社员编成三十个单位，选出专人负责领煤收款，煤价按各社员交款日门煤牌价低百分之三付给。估计以上所供煤斤足供全市社员三月之需。又该社除九月份组织棉生产共出成品羊毛秋衫四千余件，各式绒衣裤近八千件及大批毛巾、男袜、白斜纹布、白市布全部交百货公司包销外。最近百货公司又为了满足消费者需要，在十月上旬以抵羊牌毛线七百磅交由该社生产科，组织大批家庭妇女代织毛衣。
    又如长芦盐业公司在各地推销盐斤，自与合作社建立了业务关系后，销量即大为增加。如保定支公司与河北省供销总社直接联系，销盐量即由八月份的四百余担激增到九月份的三千余担，仅十月上旬即销出八千余担，占该支公司销盐总额百分之五十五以上。石家庄分公司八、九月份亦销售给市总社及各县合作社盐斤二万二千余担，占其总销量的百分之六十五以上。北京支公司与市供销总社结合全面供给了市内食盐。
    又津市造纸业原料考察团在绥远收购葫麻秆作造纸原料时，得到了绥远省合作总社的帮助，使得收购工作进行大为顺利，合作社利用与各县社联系的方便，发出通知，说明葫麻秆可以造纸，是良好的工业原料，告诉农民注意保存，收购时可用以直接换取土布、棉花等；同时并鼓励农民多种胡麻。据原料考察团调查，在绥东的集宁、丰镇、隆盛、兴和、陶林、凉城等县，共种胡麻百四十万亩，约可产胡麻秆一亿一千余万斤之多。足见供销合作社促进社员福利、组织群众生产与沟通城乡贸易等方面，是起着很大作用的。
