Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 26th: According to TASS, London: The British Peace Congress victoriously concluded on the 23rd, after two days of meetings. At the Congress on the 23rd, delegates from all parties gave enthusiastic speeches, reiterating the British people's sincere hope to live in peace, enhance friendly relations with the Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democracies, and oppose the war plans of the American and British warmongers.

　　The Congress approved the report by Montague, a member of the British Peace Committee, on the work of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress. The Congress welcomed with thunderous applause the independent Labour Party MP, Solley's, vehement attack on British policy in Greece. Solley said: Bevin must be held responsible for the bloodshed of the Greek people. Greece has become a second Spain, with six hundred American officers directing the operations, and five thousand British troops being used to oppose the Greek democrats. Bevin is forcibly imposing fascist rule on the Greek people. The miners' representative, Williams, said: British miners will never produce a ton of coal for a war against the Soviet Union. Ranson, representative of the Coventry Trades Council, declared: No worker is willing to produce goods for another war. Wainwright, secretary of the British-Soviet Association, called for trade with the Soviet Union, saying: Trade will be followed by friendship, and friendship will be followed by peace. Brown, a representative of the Amalgamated Engineering Union who recently participated in a British women's delegation to the Soviet Union, said: The Soviet people not only desire peace but are working for peace. Cole, a representative of the Electrical Trades Union, assured the Congress that electrical workers would firmly support peace and be friendly to the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies. The famous black writer, Brackman, delivered a report on peace and the struggle against colonial oppression. He called for a struggle against racial discrimination and against the oppression of colonies and other nations. Brackman emphasized the great role played by the Soviet Union in the struggle for the rights of all people. He said that during his recent visit to the Soviet Union, he was greatly moved by the atmosphere of friendship among the people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union. Pearson, a representative of veteran women soldiers, declared: American warmongers are plotting to create a new anti-Soviet war, and they want to use us British people as cannon fodder. She protested against the stationing of American troops in Britain. The famous British scientist, Bernal, urged British intellectuals to participate in the struggle for peace. He pointed out that sixty percent of national scientific research is being used for war purposes. Scientific and industrial research for peaceful purposes is being restricted, while war conscription is being intensified. Attendees welcomed with warm applause the speech by Dr. Azikiwe, representative of the National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons. He spoke about the resistance of the people of Nigeria and Cameroon to being involved in a third world war against the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies. He declared, amid increasingly loud applause: Peace is indivisible, and imperialism is the permanent source of war. Dr. Azikiwe called on the British people to strive to abolish racial color restrictions throughout the British Isles and the British Empire, to give freedom to the colonial people, and to withdraw British troops from all dependent ports.

　　Finally, Prit, an independent Labour Party member, spoke at the Congress, saying: "We are the vanguard in overcoming war." Prit, amid thunderous applause, urged the representatives to fight for peace, declaring: "The task is arduous, but as long as we do not flinch, victory is certain. We can realize our will, and life will defeat death."

　　The first British Peace Congress victoriously concluded after passing a resolution. According to the report of the Credentials Committee of the Congress, the delegates attending the Congress represented more than one million people. According to the Polish Press Agency: After the Congress, a mass rally of thousands of people was held in London to celebrate the success of the Congress and to express their determination to fight for the implementation of the Congress's resolutions.

    大会批准了英国和平委员会委员蒙太格关于世界和平大会常设委员会工作的报告。大会以雷动的鼓掌，欢迎独立的工党议员索莱对英国在希腊的政策的猛烈攻击。索莱说：贝文必须对希腊人民的流血负责。希腊已成为西班牙第二，六百名美国军官在指挥作战，五千名英国军队被用来反对希腊民主分子。贝文以强力使希腊人民接受法西斯统治。矿工代表威廉斯说：英国矿工决不为对苏战争生产一吨煤。康文特利工会理事会代表朗逊宣称：没有工人愿意为另一次战争生产货物。英苏协会秘书华恩莱特要求与苏联贸易，他说：贸易会继之以友好，友好便会继之以和平。最近曾参加英国妇女代表团访问苏联的混合机器工会代表布朗说：苏联人民不仅希望和平，而且正在为和平而努力。电气工人工会的代表柯尔向大会保证，电气工人将坚决拥护和平并对苏联与人民民主国家友好。著名的黑人作家勃拉克曼发表关于和平与反对殖民地压迫的斗争的报告。他号召为反对种族歧视和反对殖民地及其他民族的压迫而斗争。勃拉克曼强调苏联在争取一切人民的权利的斗争中所起的巨大作用。他说，在他最近一次的访苏期间，他曾为苏联各民族人民间的友爱气氛大大感动。退伍女军人代表皮尔逊宣称：美国战争贩子在阴谋制造新的反苏战争，他们要把我们英国人民当做炮灰。她抗议美军驻扎英国。著名英国科学家贝尔纳敦促英国知识分子参加争取和平的斗争。他指出全国科学研究有百分之六十被用于战争目的。为了和平目的的科学和工业研究受着限制，而战争征召则正在加紧。与会者以热烈的掌声，欢迎西菲尼日里亚民族委员会的代表阿济克威博士发言。他谈到尼日里亚和喀麦隆人民对卷入反苏、反人民民主国家的第三次世界大战的抗争。他在越来越响的掌声中宣称：和平是不可分的，帝国主义是战争的永久泉源。阿济克威博士要求英国人民争取废除在整个英伦三岛和大英帝国各地的种族肤色限制，争取给殖民地人民以自由，并从一切附属港口撤退英国军队。
    最后在大会上发言的是独立的工党分子普里特，他说：“我们是战胜战争的先锋”。普里特在雷似的掌声中力促代表们为和平作战，宣称：“任务是艰巨的，但只要我们不畏缩，胜利是确定的。我们能够实现我们的意志，生命将战胜死亡。”
    英国和平大会第一届大会在通过决议后胜利闭幕。据大会资格审查委员会报告，出席大会的代表代表了一百万以上的人民。另据波兰通讯社讯：大会结束后，伦敦举行了数千人的群众大会，庆贺大会成功，并表示为实现大会的决议而奋斗。
