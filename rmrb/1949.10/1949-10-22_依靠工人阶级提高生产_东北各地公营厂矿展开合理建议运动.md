　　Relying on the Working Class to Increase Production
  　Public Factories and Mines in Northeast China Launch Rationalization Proposal Movement
    [Report from this newspaper] The work of mobilizing the broad masses of workers and staff to actively put forward "rationalization proposals" has been gradually launched in public factories and mines in Northeast China, playing a significant role in improving technology, saving raw materials, reducing costs, and increasing output. According to statistics from the Trade Union Council of the Lushun-Dalian area, workers and staff in Lushun-Dalian put forward more than 1,400 rationalization proposals in production throughout the past year, and the labor value generated by these proposals reached 610 million Guandong currency. This year, this work has been further promoted, and some factories have planned and established organizations to launch and promote rationalization proposals, such as the technical bounty system of the railway factory, the rationalization proposal committee of the electrical factory, and the "Recruit Meritorious Deeds" committee of the China Electrical Factory, all of which have played a good role in promoting the work. The Labor Model Conference of various factories held in Jiamusi City in mid-August emphasized the launch of the rationalization proposal movement. As of the end of September, significant achievements have been made. After employees of a match company proposed changing the existing day shift system to a day and night shift system, the daily output of a single stem cutting machine increased from 24 bundles to 48 bundles. In the past, the Northeast Agricultural Implement Factory was disorganized, the division of labor in production was unclear, and there was a lot of waste of materials, and no one was responsible. After the employees proposed implementing a responsibility system, production has now become regularized. The foundry department of the Shenyang Railway Bridge Factory adopted the proposal of worker Lu Fuan, and since August, improved the manufacturing method of large straight pipes for locomotive water supply, doubling production efficiency. The factories under the Third Bureau of Military Supplies launched a rationalization proposal movement while inspecting waste. According to the suggestions put forward by the employees of the Harbin Industrial Company's Motor Factory to prevent waste in production, a plan has been drawn up to make lathes and vises; in terms of labor safety: the employees suggested installing gear covers on machines and wooden boxes on electric switches; in terms of life: bedbugs in the workers' dormitories have been eliminated, and special personnel are responsible for cleaning and hygiene of eating utensils. Workers at the Andong Silk Weaving Factory exposed many wasteful phenomena in the production process and made improvements based on their rational suggestions. For example, the twisting wheels of the circular machines in the cotton making room were made of cast iron in the past, which were easily damaged. Once damaged, the machines had to be shut down for repair, which delayed production. After being changed to wrought iron, the above-mentioned problem has been eradicated. In the past, the sand turning team of the Northeast Third Textile Factory's main factory could only melt three and a half catties of pig iron per catty of coke. After the workers paid attention to research, it can now melt about four and a half catties of pig iron per catty of coke. The Fifth Oil Factory of Siping City Grain Company accepted the rational suggestions of workers and modified the machinery and equipment, increasing the oil yield from 11.5 catties of oil per 100 catties of beans to 12.1 catties.
    The rationalization proposal movement is also being promoted in mines. The two air pumps in the first pit of the Xi'an Taixin Mine were originally used for "drilling holes" in two pits, but because the machines were too old and weak, they were not enough. The pit leader Miao Chunyang suggested "the two pits take turns drilling holes, and the two air pumps also take turns operating." As a result, the wind power was sufficient, saving more than 100,000 "dian zi" (each "dian zi" is worth more than 1,200 Northeast currency) in two months. In a certain coal mining site in Xin'an Mine, the coal inside was so hot that it burned hands and could not be taken out. The pit leader and technicians planned to abandon the coal. Team leader Guo Quanbao proposed adding a small channel next to it as a wind tunnel to reduce the temperature. The leadership adopted this suggestion. As a result, four or five hundred tons of coal inside were successfully extracted.
    Convening employee representative meetings is an important way to extensively carry out rationalization proposals. At the recent employee representative meeting of the Fuxin Coal Mine General Machinery Factory, the representatives put forward 43 rationalization proposals on overcoming waste and improving work, which have been adopted by the leadership and will play an important role in production.
    However, there are also individual factory leaders who do not humbly consider the rational suggestions of employees. According to the phenomenon of "large machines, few hemp beating workers, and waste of machine power," employees of the Keshan Flax Factory in Heilongjiang Province suggested adding ten workers. However, the administration believed that employing more people would increase expenses. As a result, after a careful calculation, if the task that can be completed by the machine's capacity in one month, it would take one and a half months because there are too few people, and the machine consumes the same amount of fuel, and the fuel consumed every day amounts to 1 million yuan (Northeast currency), but the salary of ten workers is enough for 500,000 yuan per day. The administration reluctantly agreed to add five fellow workers, but the problem has not been completely resolved.

### 依靠工人阶级提高生产　东北各地公营厂矿展开合理建议运动

　　依靠工人阶级提高生产
  　东北各地公营厂矿展开合理建议运动
    【本报讯】发动广大职工，积极提出“合理化建议”工作，已在东北各地公营厂矿中逐步展开，对于改进技术，节约原料，降低成本，提高产量各方面起作用很大。旅大地区职工总会统计，去年全年旅大职工在生产上提出的合理化建议即达一千四百余件，由这些建议所产生的劳动价值达关东币六亿一千余万元。今年这一工作更有所推进，部分厂并有计划地建立了发动、推广合理化建议的组织，如铁路工厂的技术悬赏，电化工厂的合理化建议委员会，中华电气厂的“招立功”委员会等，均起了较好的推动作用。佳木斯市在八月中旬召开的各工厂劳模大会上，强调开展合理化建议运动。迄九月底止，已获显著成绩，火柴公司职工提出变现有日班制为日夜两班制后，使原来一台切杆机日产二十四筐，提高到四十八筐。东北农具工厂过去组织混乱，生产分工不明确，材料浪费很大也无人负责，职工提出实行负责制后，现在生产已步入正规。沈阳铁路桥梁工厂翻砂部，采纳了工人吕富安的建议，从八月起，改进了机车给水用的大直管制造法，生产效率提高一倍。军需三局各厂在检查浪费中，同时开展了合理化建议运动。哈尔滨实业公司电机工厂，根据职工提出的防止生产浪费的建议，已订出做旋床子和虎钳子的计划；在劳动安全方面：职工建议机器上装牙轮盖，电闸上按木盒；在生活方面：消灭了工人宿舍内的臭虫，吃饭用具也责成专人清洁卫生。安东丝织厂工人揭露了生产过程中许多的浪费现象，并根据他们合理建议进行改进。如制绵间圆型机的绞丝轮，过去是生铁做的，容易坏，一坏即须停工修理，耽误生产。改为熟铁的以后，已根除了上述毛病。东北第三纺织厂总厂翻砂股，过去化铁水每斤焦炭只能化三斤五两荒铁，经工友注意研究后，现在每斤焦炭可化四斤半荒铁左右。四平市粮食公司第五制油厂，接受工人合理建议，修改了机器设备，产油量由过去每百斤豆出油十一斤五两，提高到十二斤一两。
    合理化建议运动也同样的在矿山中间推行着。西安泰信矿一坑的两个风泵，原供两个坑“打眼”用，但因机器太老，力量小，不足用，坑长苗春阳建议“两个坑轮流打眼，两个风泵也轮流运转”，结果风力很足，在两个月中便节省了十万多个电字（每一电字值东北币一千二百多元）。新三坑某采煤场，里面的煤热得烫手，拿不出来，坑长和技师都计划放弃这坑煤。组长郭全宝则提出在旁边送一道小川当做风道，可使温度降低。领导上采纳了这一建议。结果顺利地把里边四、五百吨煤完全取出。
    召开职工代表会议是广泛开展合理化建议的一个重要方法，阜新煤矿总机厂，在最近召开的职工代表会上，代表们对克服浪费，改进工作提了四十三条合理化建议，领导上已分别采纳，这将对生产起重要作用。
    但也有个别工厂领导上对职工合理建议不虚心考虑的现象。黑龙江省克山亚麻工厂职工根据“机器大，打麻人少，浪费机器力量”现象，建议加添十名工人。但行政上认为多用人开支大。结果细算了一下，如果按照机器能力一个月能完成的任务，因为人少须要一个半月才行，而机器同样消耗燃料，其所消耗的燃料每天即达一百万元（东北币），但十名工人的薪金，每天五十万元足够。行政上才勉强答应加添五名工友，但问题仍未彻底解决。
