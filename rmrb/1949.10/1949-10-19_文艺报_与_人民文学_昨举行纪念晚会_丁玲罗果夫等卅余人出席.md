    [Report from our newspaper] To commemorate the 13th anniversary of Lu Xun's death, "Literary Gazette" and "People's Literature" jointly held a commemorative soiree last night (the 18th) at the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles.  More than thirty people attended, including Ding Ling, Ai Qing, Feng Xuefeng, Xu Guangping, Cao Jinghua, Tian Jian, Yuan Shuipai, etc. (Guo Moruo, Zhou Yang, Mao Dun, etc., were unable to attend due to other commitments). Soviet friends Luo Guofu, Zhilin, etc., also participated. Ai Qing presided. Xu Guangping spoke first, saying: Lu Xun has always been very respectful of the Soviet Union, and today, as we commemorate Lu Xun, we should further learn from our Soviet friends. Luo Guofu pointed out in his speech: Today, the Chinese people are liberated, and Lu Xun is also liberated. This means that in the future, we can freely and deeply study Lu Xun and learn from Lu Xun's fighting spirit. He also mentioned that they are now planning to translate more of Lu Xun's works into Russian and hope that Chinese writers will provide assistance. Feng Xuefeng then analyzed the development process of Lu Xun's thought. He believes that Lu Xun's path is the path of the Chinese people's struggle. Lu Xun is great because he has always been wholeheartedly fighting for the liberation of the Chinese nation. In addition, he also raised some questions about studying Lu Xun's thoughts and works. Lou Shiyi, Tian Jian, Luo Binji, Kang Di, He Luo, Yuan Shuipai and others successively expressed their feelings about commemorating this great mentor, unanimously believing that Lu Xun should be studied more deeply, and that the valuable legacy he left to successors should be accepted. Finally, Ding Ling emphasized that we should remember Lu Xun's legacy and not be empty literary figures. During the meeting, Ke Zhongping and Zhang Ruifang recited Lu Xun's posthumous works "Such a Warrior" and "The Clever Man, the Fool, and the Slave." The commemorative soiree ended at 10:30 pm.
