On "A Serious Writing Attitude"
	Yu Cong

	"A writer's writing attitude should be serious." I think this statement is correct. Every time we write a piece, we should not only carefully observe the differences in writing methods and techniques between today and yesterday, but more importantly, examine each of our works with a serious spirit of serving the people with a high degree. Deeply consider and repeatedly revise, in order to achieve a certain effect of a work in terms of its political role. Such an attitude is a truly serious writing attitude.

	However, some people understand the "serious" writing attitude as "if you write, you must write well; if it's not good, then don't write." I think this understanding is inappropriate. We don't object to "writing for the best," but it's definitely not that we only write when it's good, and otherwise don't write. This attitude is actually using the word "serious" as a disguise to cover up its ideological essence that starts from the individual - writing should be "a hit".

	Today, in such a great era of people's victory, the task that the revolution gives to every people's literary and art worker is: to sharpen their pens like guns, and tirelessly and continuously fire at the remaining enemies, the hidden enemies, and the ideological enemies who hinder our progress. At the same time, they should also tirelessly and continuously reflect the heroic deeds and exemplary actions of the people on various revolutionary fronts, so that the broad masses of the people can learn from those exemplary figures. This is the sacred combat task of every revolutionary literary and art worker. They should also advance continuously and rapidly like the People's Liberation Army. Otherwise, by the time your "great" work is born, this matter will have become history! If a so-called "great" work cannot play a great role in organizing and promoting the real struggle, how can it be called great?

	I remember an old comrade telling a comrade who only collected materials but did not write, and did not tell others, "Write to serve the people and praise the great actions of the people's struggle; don't just collect the crystallization of the blood and sweat of the people's struggle and take it as bait for your own fame and gain." I think that every people's literary and art worker should truly and permanently remember this sentence.

### 谈“严肃的写作态度”

　　谈“严肃的写作态度”
    于聪
    “一个写作者，写作态度应该是严肃的。”我认为这样说法是对的。我们每写一篇作品，不仅是在写作方法技巧上，仔细观察今天和昨天有什么不同；更重要的是以严肃的，高度为人民服务的精神，来审察自己的每篇作品。深刻地考虑，反复的修改，以期达到一篇作品在政治作用上一定的效果。这样的态度，是真正的严肃的写作态度。
    但，有人把“严肃”的写作态度理解为“写就要写好，不好就不写”。这样的理解我认为是不恰当的。我们不反对“往好写”，但绝不是要好才写，不然就不写。这种态度，实际上是以“严肃”两字来作外衣，掩饰其从个人出发的思想本质——写东西要“一鸣惊人”。
    今天，在这样一个人民胜利的伟大时代，革命给予每个人民文艺工作者的任务是：把笔磨得象枪一样，向着残余的敌人，暗藏的敌人和阻碍我们前进的思想敌人，不疲倦地，不间断的发射。同时也应该，不疲倦地，不间断地把人民在各个革命战线上的英雄事迹和模范行动反映出来，让广大的人民群众向那些典范人物学习。这就是每个革命的文艺工作者神圣的战斗任务。他们也应该象解放军一样，不断地前进，迅速地前进。不然，等你的“伟大”作品出世，这件事情已成为历史了！所谓“伟大”作品，不能在现实斗争中起组织与推进的伟大作用，那怎么能称它是伟大呢？
    记得一位老同志，告诉一个光收集材料不写东西，又不告诉别人的同志说：“要以为人民服务，歌颂人民斗争的伟大行动而写；不要只收集人民斗争的血汗结晶，拿它作为自己沽名钓誉的鱼饵。”我想，每个人民的文艺工作者，应该切切实实地，永远地记住这句话。
