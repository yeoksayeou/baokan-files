Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 5th—TASS, Moscow dispatch: On October 1, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko, on the instructions of the Soviet government, presented notes to the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France respectively, protesting against the three countries' violation of the Potsdam Agreement and previous agreements among the four powers of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France on the German question, by creating a separate West German state. The note began: "As a separate government of the American, British, and French occupation zones in Germany was formed in Bonn on September 20 this year, the Soviet government considers it necessary to make the following statement: The formation of a separate government in the Western occupation zones of Germany cannot be explained in any other way than as the completion of the policy of splitting Germany pursued by the US, British, and French governments for several years in violation of the Potsdam Agreement. According to the Potsdam Agreement, these countries, together with the Soviet Union, jointly undertake the obligation to regard Germany as a single whole and to promote its transformation into a democratic and peaceful country. The three countries' creation of a separate West German government also violates the resolutions made at the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference in June this year, according to which the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France all pledged to continue efforts to achieve the restoration of Germany's political and economic unity. This step by the US, British, and French governments not only violates their pledged obligation to maintain Germany's unity, but also violates the obligation to conclude a peace treaty with Germany, because the establishment of a separate West German state subjects the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany to impermissible delays, which is contrary to the Potsdam Agreement." The note then enumerated historical facts to illustrate the series of illegal steps taken by the American, British, and French occupation authorities to split Germany, from unilaterally merging the three occupation zones, implementing separate currency reforms in West Germany and West Berlin, formulating so-called occupation regulations, establishing the "Ruhr International Control Bureau," employing remnants of Nazism, to manipulating their puppets to formulate the Bonn "Constitution" and establish a West German state. The note pointed out that all these actions violated various international agreements and the interests of the German people, and that the establishment of a separate West German government was "a new and broader manifestation of the policy of splitting Germany pursued by the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France for the past three years." The note vehemently condemned the American, British, and French occupation authorities for disguising their crimes with the pretext of the will of the German people and the shameless lies that this behavior did not violate the Potsdam Agreement. The note stated that the Soviet government had repeatedly warned the American, British, and French occupation authorities for three years that they would bear full responsibility for the disastrous consequences caused by this perfidious behavior, and had repeatedly suggested taking the necessary measures to establish a democratic German government. At the Paris Four Foreign Ministers Conference in June this year, the Soviet Union again proposed establishing an all-German State Council on the basis of the existing German economic organs in East and West Germany, as a unified administrative center with governmental functions, and preparing for a peace treaty with Germany. But all this was ignored by the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, which attempted to use West Germany as a bridgehead for aggressive war. The note concluded: "The Soviet government considers it necessary to draw attention to the particularly serious responsibility borne by the United States for the policy it has pursued in Germany in coordination with the United Kingdom and France. This policy has led to the establishment of the anti-national Bonn separatist government, which is hostile to the decisions of the Potsdam Conference on Germany's democratic reconstruction and the elimination of militarism, and to the obligations imposed on Germany. This policy contradicts the interests of the peace-loving people of Europe. At the same time, the Soviet government considers it necessary to declare that the aforementioned separatist government has been established in Bonn, thus creating a new situation in Germany, which makes it particularly important to achieve the following tasks: restoring Germany's unity, making it a democratic and peaceful country, and ensuring that Germany fulfills the obligations imposed on it by the Four-Power Potsdam Agreement."

　　苏照会美英法三国政府
    抗议制造西德分立国家
    斥三国背信弃义违反波茨坦协议
    【新华社北京五日电】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：十月一日，苏联外交部副部长葛罗米柯奉苏联政府指令，分别向美、英、法三国提出照会，抗议该三国违反波茨坦协定与苏美英法四国历次关于德国问题的协议，制造西德分立国家。照会首称：“由于今年九月二十日在波恩组成了德境美、英、法占领区的分立政府，苏联政府认为有必要作下述声明：德境西占区分立政府的组成，除了说它是美英法政府几年来破坏波茨坦协定而奉行的分裂德国的政策的完成外，不能作其他解释。根据波茨坦协定，这些国家与苏联共同承担义务；须视德国为单一的整体，并促进它转变成为民主与和平的国家。三国创立西德分立政府，也破坏了今年六月巴黎外长会议所作的决议，根据这些决议，苏、美、英、法政府均承诺继续努力以达成恢复德国政治与经济的统一。美英法政府这一步骤不仅违反了它们所承诺的保持德国统一的义务，而且也违反了缔结对德和约的义务，因为分立的西德国家的成立，使缔结对德和约一事，遭受不可容许的拖延，这与波茨坦协定相抵触。”照会接着历举史实说明美、英、法占领当局分裂德国的一连串非法步骤，自擅自合并三占领区，实行西德与西柏林单独的货币改革，制定所谓占领法规，建立“鲁尔国际管制局”，起用纳粹余孽，直到操纵其傀儡制定波恩“宪法”，成立西德国家。照会指出这一切行为违反各项国际协议，也违反德国人民的利益，而西德分立政府之成立，则“更是美、英、法三国政府三年来奉行的分裂德国政策之新的更广泛的表现。”照会痛斥美英法占领当局把自己的罪行诱称为德国人民意志的饰辞与这种行为不违反波茨坦协定的无耻谎言。照会说明苏联政府三年以来曾不断警告美英法三国占领当局将对这种背信弃义的行为所引起的灾难性后果，须负完全责任，并一再建议采取建立民主的德国政府的必要措施。在今年六月间巴黎四外长会议上，苏联又提出以东西德现存的德国经济机关的基础上成立全德国务会议，作为一个具有政府职能的统一行政中心，并准备对德和约。但这一切都被企图以西德为侵略战争的桥头阵地的美英法三国置若罔闻。照会最后称：“苏联政府认为有必要对美国在其协同英国和法国在德国所奉行的政策上所负的特别严重责任提起注意。这种政策已导致反民族的波恩分立政府的成立，这个政府敌视波茨坦会议关于德国民主重建与肃清军国主义的决议和加诸德国的义务。这种政策与爱好和平的欧洲人民的利益相矛盾。同时，苏联政府认为有必要声明，上述的分立政府已在波恩成立，因此在德国造成了新的情况，这使得实现下列任务特别重要，即恢复德国的统一，使之成为一个民主与和平的国家，并保证德国履行四国波茨坦协定所加诸它的义务。”
