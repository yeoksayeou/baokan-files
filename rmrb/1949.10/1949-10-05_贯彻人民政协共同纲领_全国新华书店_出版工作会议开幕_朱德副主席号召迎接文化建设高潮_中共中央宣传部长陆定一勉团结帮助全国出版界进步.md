    [Our Newspaper's Report] The National Xinhua Bookstore Publishing Work Conference opened in the capital at 9:00 AM on October 3rd. One hundred and fifteen representatives attended and were present as observers. Vice Chairman Zhu De of the Central People's Government and Minister Lu Dingyi of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee personally attended. Guests included Shen Junru, Mao Dun, Yang Hansheng, Zhao Shuli, and others, totaling more than forty people. After Chairman of the Conference Hu Yuzhi delivered the opening speech, Vice Chairman Zhu took the stage amidst enthusiastic applause. He called on national publishing workers to prepare to welcome the high tide of cultural construction that will come with economic construction, encouraging them to turn into reality the stipulation in the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to "develop the people's publishing industry and pay attention to publishing popular books and newspapers that are beneficial to the people," to unite all those willing and able to serve the people's publishing cause, and to work together (the full text of the speech is in another telegram). Minister Lu Dingyi then spoke, further elaborating on Vice Chairman Zhu's instruction on uniting all publishing workers willing to serve the people to work together, calling on everyone to not only manage the Xinhua Bookstore or the publishing industry in one region, but also to have a national perspective. Besides the publishing industry of bureaucratic capital which should be confiscated, all other publishing circles should be well united to help them progress, so that none of them stray. Minister Lu gave a high estimate of the achievements of the two revolutionary publishing teams in the liberated areas and the former Kuomintang areas, and expressed enthusiastic expectations for the future publishing cause. All the representatives were deeply moved. Others who spoke included Mao Dun, Shen Junru, Song Yunbin, Zhao Shuli, Ye Shengtao, and others. The conference finally passed a congratulatory telegram to celebrate the establishment of the Central People's Government, a salute telegram to Chairman Mao, and a salute telegram to Commander-in-Chief Zhu. The conference schedule from the 4th to the 7th includes a political report by Minister Lu Dingyi, a report on the general situation of the national publishing industry by Hu Yuzhi, a work report by Huang Luofeng of the Publishing Committee of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee, a report on the revolutionary publishing work in the Kuomintang areas by Xu Boxin, and work reports by Xinhua Bookstores in various strategic areas. The conference will focus on group discussions, strengthen off-site deliberation and preparation, so that the conference discussion can proceed more smoothly. The conference is expected to end in mid-October.
