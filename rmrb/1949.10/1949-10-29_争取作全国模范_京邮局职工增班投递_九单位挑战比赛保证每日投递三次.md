　　Striving to be a National Model
    Beijing Postal Bureau Employees Increase Delivery Shifts
    Nine Units Compete in Challenge to Guarantee Three Deliveries Daily
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Employees of the Beijing Postal Bureau have been actively proposing to increase delivery shifts, striving to make the capital's postal work a model for postal work nationwide. This movement was first initiated by the employees of the 20th Branch Bureau, and all employees of the bureau responded, unanimously agreeing that one more delivery should be added each day. At the same time, in order to complete the task of three deliveries per day, adjustments were made to redistribute routes, taking into consideration the older employees. In addition, it was decided that starting from the 15th, Sundays would no longer be rest days, and savings deposits, remittances, package receiving and dispatching, and stamp sales would be added. After the 20th Branch Bureau issued its challenge, a total of nine units, including fourteen branch bureaus, have now responded. All have discussed the matter based on their specific circumstances and have guaranteed three deliveries daily.
