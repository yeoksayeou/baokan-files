　　To Facilitate Bristle and Egg Product Exports
  　Baoding Opens Inter-port Documentary Bill Negotiation
    [Baoding Electric] The Hebei Provincial Branch Business Department of the People's Bank of China has reached an agreement with the Tianjin Bank of China to begin handling inter-port import documentary bill negotiations. The stipulated amount for each household is no more than 30 million yuan. This will greatly facilitate the future export of hog bristles, pig bristles, egg whites, egg yolks, Anguo medicinal materials, and local products such as mountain goods from western Hebei from Baoding. This business will initially involve exporters applying for registration with the Tianjin Bank of China, which will then issue a purchase certificate. The exporter can then use the purchase certificate to obtain a loan from the Hebei Provincial Branch Business Department in Baoding, and purchase, transport, and export the local goods.

　　便利鬃毛蛋品出口
  　保定开办埠际押汇
    【保定电】中国人民银行河北省分行营业部已与天津中国银行商妥，开始办理埠际进口押汇，押汇款额规定每户不超过三千万元。这样就给了今后由保定输出的猪毛、猪鬃、蛋青、蛋黄及安国药材，冀西的山货等土产品，以很大的便利，该项业务是首次由出口商向天津中国银行办理申请登记，再由中国银行发给采购证，出口商持采购证，即可到保市河北省分行营业部贷款，并收购与运输土货办理出口。
