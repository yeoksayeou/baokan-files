　　Learning Russian Requires Political Enthusiasm
　　Gong Tao

After studying Russian for two weeks, we held a review meeting. Ah Lin said with a smile, "When I knew I had the opportunity to learn Russian, I jumped for joy. The construction of the Soviet Union is such a strong call to me. I want to learn Russian immediately to absorb their construction experience to build our motherland. Therefore, I want to complete this study as a political task."

"I also know the importance of this study, but I feel quite difficult. There are some places I have been pondering for a long time and still don't understand. I think I am too old, not as fast as you young people!" Comrade Li, who was in his thirties, said with some sigh.

Ah Lin immediately followed up: "Too old? Age cannot limit learning enthusiasm. I think what makes you feel difficult is because you are exploring alone and are unwilling to ask other comrades. Maybe you think it's embarrassing to ask others. This is wrong. Do you know that collective learning is faster than personal groping? Comrade Li, I hope you ask others more, even if there is a little bit you don't understand!"

"Overcoming difficulties is necessary, but what if we still can't overcome them even if we have made enough subjective efforts? Take me! I just can’t pronounce the 'r' sound. I've taken six lessons, and I still can't make this sound. I practice every day. You can't say I haven't worked hard enough!" Little Yang frowned and pouted.

"I know you are working hard to pronounce 'r', but because you pay too much attention and use too much force, your tongue becomes stiff. It will not be shaken by the air coming from your throat. Think about it, children don't feel it at all when they play games, and those who drive ox carts and horse carts, their whips are raised, and the sound of 'r' is naturally emitted. Don't worry, just relax and curl the tip of your tongue inward, let the air from your throat impact it, and it will naturally vibrate and make a sound."

"What I find easy to remember are the new words. I remember each word as soon as I read it, unlike English, where spelling is difficult and you have to memorize the letters! Let's talk about grammar. At first glance: tables and newspapers all have masculine and feminine genders, and when do they have to be declined? One word has six cases, how complicated! But upon closer inspection, it is very scientific. Although everything has a gender, it changes according to rules. Once you learn it, you won't use it wrong. I think this change is very good!" Old Liu interjected this paragraph! Then he turned his head and glanced at Old Wang. Old Wang's face turned red, and he continued in a very small voice:

"Comrades all say that I only care about personal learning. When I first heard it, I didn't think about it. I felt that whether it was personal or collective, it would be fine as long as I learned it well! But in recent days, I have seen Ah Lin so enthusiastically helping comrades learn, and my thinking has fluctuated. I have reviewed myself and committed a purely professional viewpoint. I thought that if I learned Russian well, it would be more convenient for future work. I didn't have time to help others, and I was also afraid that others would slow down my progress and prevent me from going fast. This is purely the kind of learning attitude of the old society, treating the knowledge and skills I have learned as my own private property, like a guarding slave!"

"Comrade Wang has reviewed himself very well. He often hides in secluded places to study. We should remember the call of the study committee: 'One person knowing doesn't count as knowing, and it doesn't count as knowing if one person doesn't know.' We must closely link personal learning with collective learning. We think that even if one person learns very well, the effect is very limited. You can't build a new China alone, let alone collective learning will also improve personal learning. Therefore, we hope that Comrade Wang's review today can be implemented into practice!"

After this review, the enthusiasm for group learning was even higher, and mutual aid groups also launched learning competitions. There was half an hour of conversation every afternoon to correct each other's inaccurate pronunciation. During breaks, they made a circle and played Russian games. One person played the table, one dressed up as the teacher, books, newspapers, and pencils all moved, and they all conversed! They use a word as soon as they learn it! Every comrade was encouraged to have enthusiasm for learning.

One afternoon, I was learning a method when suddenly two hands reached out from behind and grabbed my head and shook it: "I'm telling you, I can pronounce 'r'! Listen!" Then there was a series of 'r' sounds, this was Old Wang. I was surprised at how quickly he had improved!

"I'm telling you! Just now the branch organization committee member asked me to talk about joining the Communist Youth League. I thought I wanted to join the Communist Youth League, and this political task must be completed well, but I still can't pronounce 'r'! I practiced while walking, and I suddenly learned it. Do you think it's strange? What do you think is the reason!"

"This is because you have a high degree of political enthusiasm! As long as you have political enthusiasm, any difficulties can be overcome, don't you think!"

Everyone laughed, we held hands and jumped up, we all felt that this force will always encourage us forward!

### 学习俄文要有政治热情

　　学习俄文要有政治热情
    公陶
    学习两周的俄文后，我们开了一个检讨会。阿林笑眯眯的说：“当我知道有机会学习俄文时，我欢喜得跳起来，苏联的建设是那么强烈的召唤着我，我想立刻就学好俄文，便于吸收他们的建设经验，来建设我们底祖国，因此我要把这个学习当作政治任务去完成。”
    “我也知道这个学习的重要，但我却感到相当的困难，有些地方我捉摸了很久还是不知道，我想是我的年龄太大了，不如你们年青人学得快！”三十多岁的李同志有些慨叹的说。
    阿林立刻就接上去了：“年龄大吗？年龄可限制不了学习热情，我想使你觉得困难的，是因为你一个人摸索，不肯问别的同志，也许你以为问别人难为情，这是错的，你知道集体学习比个人去捉摸快吗？李同志我希望你多问别人，那怕有一点不懂！”
    “克服困难是应该的，可是当我们主观努力很够了还不能克服怎么办呢？象我吧！＠就不会打，上过六课了，我还不会发这个音，我每天都练，这不能说我努力不够吧！”小杨皱着眉噘起了嘴。
    “我知道你很努力打＠，但由于你过分注意和用力，舌头就硬了，它不会被嗓子里发出的气冲击而抖动，你想，小孩子做游戏的时候毫不觉得的＠，还有那些赶牛车、马车的人，他们的鞭子一扬，＠的声音很自然的就发出了，你不用着急，你只要轻松的让舌尖向里卷，让嗓子里出的气冲动了它，很自然的弹动而发声。”
    “使我觉得容易记的倒是生字，每个字都是读音就记得了，不象英文那样拼音困难，而且要死记字母！再说文法吧，起初一看：桌子、书报，都有阳性阴性，什么时候又要变格，一个字就有六格，多么复杂！仔细一看，这却很科学，虽然每一件东西都有性属，但是有规律的变化，学会了就不会用错，我觉得这变化得很好！”老刘插了这一段！随着他转头瞅了一眼老王，老王的脸红了，用那很小的声音接下去：
    “同志们都说我只顾个人学习，刚听见时，我没有考虑，我感觉得个人也好，集体也好，反正我学好了就成了！可是这些日子来我看见阿林那么热心的帮助同志学习，我思想才有了波动，我检讨自己犯了纯业务观点，我想学好了俄文，以后工作更方便，我没有时间去帮助别人，我也怕别人进度慢拖着了我，使我不能走得快，这纯粹是旧社会的那种学习态度，把学得的知识技能当作自己私有的财产，象守败奴那样！”
    “王同志检讨得很好，他常常一个人躲在隐僻的地方学习，我们应该记住学委会的号召：“一个人会不算会，有一个人不会也不算会”，我们要使个人学习与集体学习紧密的联系，我们想，即使一个人学的顶好，效果也很有限，你又不能独自的建设新中国，何况集体学习好了个人的学习也会好。因此我们希望王同志今天的检讨能贯彻到实践里去！”
    经过这次检讨后，小组学习的热情更高了，互助小组也展开了学习竞赛，每天下午有半小时的会话，互相纠正发音的不准确，在休息时又围了一个圈作俄文游戏，一个扮桌子、一个装老师，书、报、铅笔都动起来了，都会话了！学一个字就用一个字！每个同志都鼓起了学习的热情。
    一天下午我正在学方法，突然背后伸出了两只手抱住我的头摇摆：“我告诉你，我会打＠了，你听！”接着就是一连串＠的声音，这便是老王。我奇怪他进步得这么快！
    “我告诉你呀！刚才支部组织委员要我去谈入团的事，我想我要入团了，这个政治任务要好好的完成，可是我还不会打＠呀！我一面走就一面练习，不知怎的突然就会了，你说奇怪吗？你说这是什么道理！”
    “这是由于你有高度的政治热情呀！只要有政治热情什么困难都可以克服的，你说是吗！”
    大家都笑了，我们拉着手跳起来，我们都觉得这股力量永远鼓舞着我们向前！
