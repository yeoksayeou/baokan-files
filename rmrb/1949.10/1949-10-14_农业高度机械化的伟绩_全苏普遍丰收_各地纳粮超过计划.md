　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 12th: Comprehensive reports from TASS: This year's harvesting, grain delivery, and winter sowing work in various parts of the Soviet Union have achieved great success. From Lithuania, Belarus, and Ukraine in the west to Siberia in the east, harvests have been good. Although climatic conditions were unfavorable in some areas, rich harvests were still obtained. State farms and collective farms are completing their grain delivery plans ahead of schedule and exceeding them by large amounts, and granaries everywhere are piled high with grain. The total grain delivery in the Gomel region of Belarus increased by 300,000 poods (one pood is approximately 27 kilograms) compared to last year, and 380,000 poods more than in the pre-war year of 1940. The region will deliver at least 150,000 poods of grain above the plan. More than 5,000 collective farms in the Ukrainian Republic have completed their grain delivery plans ahead of schedule. The Chernigov region delivered 1,644,400 poods more grain to the state this year than last year, an increase of 3,324,400 poods compared to the pre-war year of 1940. The South Kazakhstan region of the Kazakh Republic had delivered more than one million poods of grain above the plan by September 5th. The Stavropol region in southern Russia delivered 2.5 million poods of grain above the plan. State farms and collective farms in the Altai Krai of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic have delivered 20 million poods more grain than in the pre-war year of 1940 and 10 million poods more than last year. They have also undertaken the obligation to deliver at least 10 million poods of grain to the state additionally.
　　Simultaneous with harvesting and grain delivery, the sowing of winter crops has been carried out on a large scale throughout the Soviet Union. At present, collective farms in the Soviet Union have sown seeds on more than four-fifths of the winter crop area. The winter wheat area in the Stavropol region has increased by 166,000 hectares compared to last year. The northeastern region of Ukraine has planted the first batch of thousands of hectares of winter wheat and rye, and the northern, central, and southern regions of the Urals and Siberia have also completed their sowing targets.
　　The increase in Soviet agricultural production is inseparable from the mechanization of agriculture and the improvement of agricultural science. The Bolshevik Party and the Soviet government, concerned about the collective farms, supplied them with more tractors, combine harvesters, threshers, and grain cleaning machines this year. Collective farms in Primorye used new harvesters—self-propelled combine harvesters. Siberia obtained a large number of combine harvesters this year, and Stavropol has hundreds of the latest equipped combine harvesters, tractors, and threshers, ensuring a high level of field harvesting work in a timely manner. Many collective farms are using special strip seeders, which sow seeds along with fertilizer. In terms of scientific seed selection, new varieties are being widely adopted. In the central area of Ukraine where winter crops are planted, more than 40 percent of the area is used to plant new varieties, which yield 500 to 1,000 kilograms more crops per hectare than ordinary seeds. In addition, new wheat varieties are being adopted in the Vinnytsia, Kiev, and other regions. Due to the adoption of these new varieties, many collective farms harvested as much as 4.4 to 4.7 tons of wheat per hectare this year. Now, collective farmers in various parts of the Soviet Union are launching a sowing competition to complete the sowing plan ahead of schedule.

　　农业高度机械化的伟绩
    全苏普遍丰收
    各地纳粮超过计划
    【新华社北京十二日电】综合塔斯社报道：苏联各地今年的收割、纳粮和冬季播种工作都获得极大的成功。自西部的立陶宛、白俄罗斯、乌克兰一直到东部的西伯利亚，收成都很好，部分地区虽然气候条件不好，但仍然得到了富收。国营农场和集体农场正纷纷提前完成并大量超过纳粮计划，各地的谷仓里都已堆满了粮食。白俄罗斯哥美尔州的纳粮总额比去年增加了三十万普特（一普特约合二十七市斤），比战前一九四○年多三十八万普特，该州将至少超计划交纳十五万普特的谷物。乌克兰共和国的五千余集体农场已先期完成交纳谷物的计划，切尔尼哥夫州今年向国家交纳的谷物比去年多一百六十四万四千普特，与战前一九四○年相较，增加三百三十二万四千普特。哈萨克共和国的南哈萨克斯坦州在九月五日前就超计划的交纳了一百万普特以上的谷物。南俄的斯塔夫罗波尔州超计划交纳了二百五十万普特的谷物。苏俄阿尔泰边疆区的国营农场和集体农场已缴纳了比战前一九四○年多二千万普特，比去年多一千万普特的谷物，他们还承担了额外向国家交纳至少一千万普特谷物的义务。
    与收割和纳粮同时，苏联各地冬季作物的播种已在大规模地进行。现在苏联集体农场已在五分之四强的冬季作物地区上播了种。斯塔夫罗波尔州的冬季小麦地区较去年增加十六万六千公顷。乌克兰东北地区已种植了第一批成千公顷的冬季小麦和裸麦，乌拉尔和西伯利亚的北部、中部和南部各州也已完成了他们的播种目标。
    苏联农产量的提高，和农业机械化，及农业科学的增进，是分不开的。关切集体农场的布尔塞维克党和苏维埃政府今年供给了集体农场更多的拖拉机、联合机、打谷机、清谷机。普里摩里的集体农场使用了新的收割机——自动推进复合机，西伯利亚今年获得了大量的联合机，斯塔夫罗波尔则有数百架最新装备的联合机，拖拉机、打谷机，及时地保证了农田收获工作的高度水平。许多集体农场都在使用特种的条播机，这种机器把种子连同肥料一道播下。在科学选种方面，新品种正被普遍采用，乌克兰种植冬季作物的中心地区，用百分之四十多的面积来种植新品种，这种种子比普通种子每一公顷要多收五百至一千公斤的作物。此外，温尼查，基辅等州都在采用一种新的小麦品种。由于采用这种新品种，今年许多集体农场每公顷打了四·四——四·七吨那样多的小麦。现在，苏联各地的集体农民正为提前完成播种计划展开播种竞赛。
