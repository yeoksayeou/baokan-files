    (5) The organizational leadership work of the academy proves that the more a mass activity is broad-based, freely participated in, and relies mainly on content rather than organizational force to unite the masses, the more it should have a strong core organization that connects with the masses. Because middle school students went home for the summer vacation and were very dispersed, notification and contact were very difficult. Moreover, we lacked experience in the grassroots organizational forms for the academy to connect with and lead mass activities. Initially, we wanted to use the cadres of student unions in various schools as the core to unite and lead the students from each school participating in the academy. However, due to the small number of student union members remaining during the summer vacation, they could not take on this task. Furthermore, since the average number of Youth League members in ordinary middle schools was not large and their work experience was insufficient, it was also impossible to rely on the Youth League branches to play the main core role of leading the masses. Only later, after re-adjusting the cadres and establishing a certain number of counselors specifically to contact students from various schools, was this problem solved. The counselors played a role similar to that of grade supervisors or instructors, responsible for contacting students, answering various questions from students, and integrating with students when participating in group activities. This made the relationship between the masses and the academy closer. The phenomenon that students came to the academy but were ignored except for attending cultural supplementary classes, and felt cold, was then resolved.
    In addition, it was stipulated that each district academy should convene a weekly meeting of all students, announcing the week's activities and schedule in advance, so that everyone could participate according to the schedule. In addition, it was emphasized that students should take the initiative and overcome the idea of waiting, which solved some of the lax phenomena in the early stage of the academy.
    Since the academy is a very broad and free organization, it is easy for participants to feel no different from ordinary students. Therefore, a very low registration fee was stipulated, academy certificates were issued, and uniform academy commemorative badges were made for identification. This was approved by the majority of students.
    (6) Development of the League: A month of academy activities is basically a study movement. In this movement, because League members worked, studied, and lived with students, the vast majority of students recognized the essential difference between the Youth League and the Three People's Principles Youth League. During various activities of the academy, a large number of activists emerged among the students. However, when promoting the Youth League at the beginning, some students were dissatisfied with the arrogant attitude of some League members. Some students said, "I will join Feng Wenbin's League, but I will not join the League in this school." Some people were afraid that joining the League would delay their studies. Some said, "I will join the League after I study well." Some were afraid of being transferred to work after joining the League, and some were afraid of losing their freedom after joining the League, etc. There were also some students who simply did not understand what the League was doing. After a report introducing the Youth League was made, questions were answered to resolve ideological concerns. At the same time, League members conducted criticism and self-criticism among students (or at League branch meetings attended by students). After this, a large number of students understood that the Youth League is an organization of young people themselves. More than a thousand people automatically applied to join the League, and the formalities were still handled by the branches of each school, and they were sworn in collectively. Due to the haste of time, 881 people were approved (those approved after the end of the academy were not included in the statistics).
    (7) It is necessary and possible to win the assistance of progressive and enthusiastic people from all parties. For example, 130 teachers, 117 university students, and 7 university teaching assistants were united to teach cultural supplementary classes, more than a dozen physical education teachers were invited to help organize and guide sports activities, school buildings were borrowed from many schools as academy addresses, and simple receptions were held before and after. This not only helped our work but also strengthened the connection between the Youth League and the Student Federation and various other parties.
    (8) Due to lack of experience, although the characteristics of summer students being scattered and the academy lacking strict organizational constraints were noted at the beginning, no proper method was found, resulting in lax organizational leadership in the early stage. Also, due to the emphasis on high democracy and free participation, there was a misunderstanding that there was no need to take attendance in cultural supplementary classes and that individual scattered phenomena of absenteeism were allowed. This was later corrected. Secondly, the material preparation for the academy activities was insufficient, with few recreational room equipment and toys, forming a simple and crude situation. Sports activities were not active enough, and travel and visits were too few. The publicity work was generally poor except in individual districts. After the organizational leadership was strengthened in the middle of the academy, and the concerns of the masses at the initial stage were also eliminated, some students who had not participated asked to join the League, and there were phenomena of asking whether academy certificates could be "bought" to participate, but this did not attract attention. We did not actively absorb more students to participate. These are all shortcomings.
    The achievements are obvious. The ideology of the vast number of students participating in the academy has been improved a step further, and because of the large number of participants, the influence is relatively widespread. Many students who did not participate in the academy later expressed regret for missing the opportunity. Since the beginning of this semester, the atmosphere of learning in schools has been strong. Many students believe that the help they received from the academy was great. These prove that the Party's guiding principle is correct and that this new organizational form is worth promoting.

　　暑期学园总结（续）
   　新民主主义青年团北京市筹委会
    （五）学园的组织领导工作，证明了愈是带广泛群众性的、自由参加的、主要依靠内容而不是依靠组织的作用来团结群众的活动，愈应该有一个坚强的联系群众的核心机构。由于暑假中学生放假回家，十分分散，通知联络都十分困难。而我们对学园联系领导群众活动的基层组织形式无经验，最初想利用各校学生会干部做团结带领各校参加学园的同学的核心，结果因暑期学生会留下人很少，不能负起这一任务。又由于青年团员在一般中学平均数量并不多，工作经验也不够，依靠青年团支部起带领群众的主要的核心作用，亦属不可能。只在后来重新调整干部，设立了一定数量专门联系各校同学的辅导员，才解决了这个问题，辅导员起着某些类似级任或指导员的作用，负责和学生联系，解答同学各种问题，参加小组等活动时与同学打成一片。这样才使群众对学园的关系密切起来了。最初发生过的学生来到学园除上文化补习课外无人答理，感到冷淡的现象，才得到解决。
    此外，规定了每周各区学园召集全体学生的周会，事先宣布一周活动项目及日程，使大家可按日程参加。此外，又强调同学大家主动动手，克服等待思想，才使学园初期的某些松弛现象得到解决。
    由于学园是很广泛自由的组织，容易使参加者觉得与一般学生毫无区别，因此规定收很低的注册费，发给学园证，制出统一的学园纪念章，以资识别。这样做是受广大同学赞成的。
    （六）团的发展：一个月的学园活动，基本上是一个学习运动。在这个运动过程中，由于团员与同学在一起工作、学习、生活，绝大部分同学认识了青年团和三青团有着本质上的区别。在学园的各种活动中，同学中涌现出大批积极分子。但在开始宣传青年团时，有一些同学不满于一些团员自高自大的作风，有的同学们说：“我入冯文彬的团，但不入本校的团。”有的人怕入团后耽误学习。有的说：“等学习好了再入团。”有的怕入团后被调出工作，怕入团后不自由等。还有部分同学根本就不了解团是搞什么的。在作过青年团介绍的报告后又做了问题解答，解决了思想上的顾虑，同时配合着团员在同学中（或在有同学参加的团支部大会上）进行了批评和自我批评以后，大批同学了解了青年团是青年人自己的组织，有一千多人自动申请入团，仍由各校支部办理手续，集中宣誓入团。由于时间的仓促，批准了八百八十一人（学园结束后继续批准的未统计在内。）
    （七）争取各方进步热心人士的协助是必要的，也是可能的。如团结了一百三十位教员和一百十七位大学同学和七位大学助教教文化补习课，邀请了十几位体育教员帮助组织指导体育活动，向许多学校借校舍作学园地址，在事先事后都举行了简朴的招待。这既可使我们工作得到帮助，又可密切了青年团与学联和各方面的联系。
    （八）由于缺少经验，在开始时虽然注意到暑期学生分散及学园没有严格的组织约束的这些特点，但未摸索出妥善办法，产生了初期组织领导的松弛。又由于强调了高度民主与自由参加，产生了误解，以为在文化补习课也用不着点名，可以随便缺席的个别散漫现象，后来才得到纠正。其次，学园活动的物质准备不够，游艺室设备玩具无几，形成简陋。体育活动还不够活跃，旅行参观做得太少。宣传工作除了个别区外，一般做得差。在学园中期加强了组织领导以后，而且群众在初举办时的顾虑也消除了，这时有些未参加的学生要求入团，且有询问可否“收买”学园证来参加的现象产生，但未引起注意。我们也没有积极地更多地吸收同学参加。这些都是缺点。
    成绩是显明的，参加学园的广大同学思想提高了一步，而且由于参加人数的众多，影响也比较广泛。许多未参加学园的学生在后来表示后悔失去了机会，这学期开学以来，学校中学习空气浓厚。许多同学都认为从学园中得到的帮助很大。这些证明党指示的方针是正确的，这种新的组织形式是值得提倡的。
