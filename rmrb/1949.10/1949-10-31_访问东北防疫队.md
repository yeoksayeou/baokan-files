　　Visiting the Northeast Anti-Epidemic Team

　　The Northeast People's Government Health Department Anti-Epidemic Team, consisting of fifty-nine people, arrived in Beijing by train from Shenyang at eleven o'clock on the morning of the 30th. The reporter interviewed Jiang Yaode, the head of the team.
　　Plague has occurred in the Northeast region for many years, greatly endangering the lives and property of the people, especially the plague outbreak in 1947, which was the most widespread and caused the highest number of deaths. The responsible departments of the Northeast Party and government attach great importance to this work. Jiang Yaode first described to the reporter the process of establishing the team. He said: The Northeast Anti-Epidemic Team was mostly established in 1947. For several years, they have been scattered throughout the Northeast, engaging in the prevention and treatment of plague and general infectious diseases. Among the fifty-nine people who came to Beijing this time, there are eight doctors, four assistant doctors, and the rest are anti-epidemic team members and administrative cadres. Due to the relatively long time of establishment, especially with the enthusiastic assistance of Soviet friends, it is relatively complete both in terms of medical technology and equipment. Since 1947, the Soviet Red Cross and Red Crescent Society has sent anti-epidemic teams every year to guide and help prevent and treat plague. We are very grateful for this brotherly friendship from our Soviet friends. In addition to general equipment, our anti-epidemic team has a relatively sound laboratory, which is an important part of testing for plague. In addition to ordinary microscopic examination, the laboratory can also perform bacterial culture, animal inoculation and dissection, and test for the presence of carrier rodents and carrier fleas. This time, we are going to Chahar, carrying Soviet dried live bacteria vaccine for preventive injections for more than 150,000 people, 30,000 cc of serum for plague patients, 8.87 million doses of methylene blue, 125 kilograms of Soviet disinfectant, 25 kilograms of Soviet special insecticide for lice, 90 kilograms of Soviet carbolic acid, 400 pounds of Chinese disinfectant, and more than 100 pounds of DDT and other drugs.
　　This team worked with the first detachment of the Soviet Red Cross and Red Crescent Society Anti-Epidemic Team in Rehe for half a year this year. They just returned to Shenyang from Rehe and immediately accepted the task of going to the Chahar epidemic area.
　　When talking about the prevention and treatment of plague in Chahar, Jiang Yaode said: Based on the experience in the Northeast, the prevention and treatment of plague is a mass work. Only by mobilizing and organizing the masses can it be easy to achieve results. This year, in the Kalaqin Banner area of Rehe, with a total of 200,000 people, we conducted publicity to 140,000 people, gave preventive injections to more than 100,000 people, and cultivated 100 mass hygiene models. Every ten households are organized into a hygiene group, and a hygiene group leader is selected. Families should carry out three cleaning sessions every day. This kind of mass hygiene organization is of great help in preventing and treating plague. Our team and the Soviet anti-epidemic team caught a total of 140,000 rats, and the masses caught 160,000 rats. Among the 300,000 rats, the test results showed that six were truly carriers and fourteen had plague. In addition to the publicity and organization of the masses, for areas where the existence of plague has been determined, we must first implement blockade, isolation, disinfection, rat catching, flea extermination, and digging of rat-proof trenches, and establish isolation treatment hospitals; in areas where the existence of plague has not yet been confirmed, the most important thing is to discover patients early. After laboratory tests, if it is proved that plague has indeed occurred, all the above measures must be taken. In 1947, plague in the Northeast was very rampant; after the widespread development of anti-epidemic work, the situation has changed significantly. It has now almost completely disappeared.

　　访问东北防疫队
    林洪
    东北人民政府卫生部防疫队五十九人于三十日上午十一时由沈乘车来京，记者访问了该队负责人蒋耀德。
    东北地区经年发生鼠疫，对于人民生命财产均危害甚大，尤以一九四七年的鼠疫蔓延最广，死亡的人数最多，东北党、政负责部门对于这一工作十分重视。蒋耀德首先向记者叙述了该队成立的经过。他说：东北防疫队大部是在一九四七年成立的，几年来都分散在东北各地从事鼠疫及一般传染病的防治工作。此次来京的五十九人中，有医生八名，助理医生四名，其余均为防疫队员与行政干部。由于成立的时间较长，特别是得到了苏联友人的热情援助，所以无论在医疗技术和设备方面均较完善。自一九四七年以来，苏联红十月半月协会每年均派防疫队前来指导及帮助防治鼠疫的工作。对于苏联朋友这种兄弟般的友谊，我们是很感谢的。我们的防疫队除了一般设备外，有一个较健全的化验室，是检验鼠疫的一个重要部分。除普通的显微镜检查外，化验室还能作细菌培养，动物接种及解剖，检验保菌鼠和保菌跳蚤的有无等。此次前去察北，我们携带了为十五万余人预防注射的苏联干燥生菌疫苗、为鼠疫患者注射的三万西西血清、八百八十七万美兰、一百二十五公斤苏联消毒药、二十五公斤苏联灭虱特效药、九十公斤苏联石炭酸、四百磅中国消毒药、及一百多磅ＤＤＴ等药品。
    该队与苏联红十月半月协会防疫第一分队今年在热河一同工作了半年，刚从热河回到沈阳，便立刻接受了前去察北疫区的工作。
    谈到察北鼠疫的防治问题时，蒋耀德说：根据在东北的经验，防治鼠疫是一件群众性的工作，只有把群众发动组织起来，才易收到效果。今年在热河喀喇沁旗地方，全境共二十万人，我们向十四万人进行了宣传，为十万余人作了防疫注射，培养出一百个群众卫生模范。每十户人家组织成一个卫生小组，选出一个卫生小组长。群众家里每天要进行三次清洁工作。这种群众性的卫生组织，对防治鼠疫有很大帮助。我们和苏联防疫队共捕了十四万只老鼠，群众捕了十六万只。三十万只老鼠中，经检验结果，真正保菌的有六只，发生鼠疫的有十四只。除了对群众的宣传组织外，我们对已确定鼠疫存在的地区，首先要实行封锁、隔离、消毒、捕鼠、灭蚤和挖防鼠沟，并设立隔离治疗病院；在还未肯定鼠疫存在的地区，最重要的是先期发现病人，经化验检查，证明鼠疫确已发生，便要采取上述的一切措施。一九四七年，东北鼠疫曾十分猖獗；以后防疫工作普遍展开，情形便有显著改变。现已几乎全部绝迹。
