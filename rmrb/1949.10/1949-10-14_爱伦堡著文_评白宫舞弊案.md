Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 11th: TASS, Moscow, July 7th: Ehrenburg wrote an article in *Pravda* commenting on the corruption case of Major General Vaughan, aide to the US President, who used his position as an intermediary between private companies and government departments. Ehrenburg wrote: The term "Vaughanism," which has appeared in American newspapers, has become a "eulogy" for American morality and the American way of life. The recent corruption case in Washington is particularly instructive because it did not occur in the gangster dens of Chicago, nor in the clubs of New York stockbrokers, but in the White House. If such things are done in the White House, what else is going on in the ordinary residences where senators and members of Congress live? Ehrenburg pointed out: Thugs from both parties are very similar. Some people accept bribes, others give bribes; some people present gifts, others collect commissions: those who are accustomed to stealing will hide. On the one hand they do this, on the other hand they solemnly talk about their integrity and the fairness of American morality. If these senior thugs are so active at home, it is easy to understand what they are doing abroad. However, countries build cities, plant orchards, and create culture, not so that Vaughanists can put Europe in their bottomless pockets. They enjoy their dealings, but we clearly say to them: Your appetites must be limited.

　　爱伦堡著文
    评白宫舞弊案
    【新华社北京十一日电】塔斯社莫斯科七日讯：爱伦堡在真理报撰文，评论美国总统副官渥汉少将舞弊案，渥氏曾利用他的地位，充当各私营公司与各政府部门间的中间人。爱伦堡写道：美国报纸上所出现的“渥汉主义”的名词，成为对于美国道德和美国生活方式的“歌颂”。华盛顿最近的舞弊案，是特别具有教育意义的，因为它不是发生在芝加哥的匪窟，也不是发生在纽约股票经纪人的俱乐部，而是发生在白宫。倘若这种事情是在白宫里搞出来的，那末在参众议员们所居住的普通住宅里，又在搞些什么事情呢？爱伦堡指出：两党棍徒们是很相似的。有些人接受贿赂，另外有些人给与贿赂；有些人献呈礼品，另外有些人收纳佣金：惯于偷窃的人，是会隐匿的。一方面这样做，另一方面他们却庄严地谈论他们的廉洁以及美国道德的公正性。倘若这些高级党徒们在国内这样活跃，人们当能容易地了解，他们在国外是搞些什么名堂。然而各国建造城市，种植果园，创造文化，并不是为了叫渥汉主义者们把欧洲放在他们的无底口袋里。他们对他们的勾当觉得津津有味，但我们却对他们明白地说：必须限制你们的胃口。
