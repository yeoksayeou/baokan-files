Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 15th. The full text of Fadeyev's speech at the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum is as follows:

　　Dear friends! Today, we Soviet cultural workers express our highest respect in memory of the great Sun Yat-sen.

　　The name of this outstanding Chinese national revolutionary activist is a glorious name, which has surpassed national boundaries and is included in the world's book of meritorious deeds.

　　As early as the end of the 19th century, during the Sino-Japanese War, Mr. Sun Yat-sen launched the Chinese national liberation movement. This movement immediately took on a noble patriotic character, striving to free the Chinese nation from the oppression of foreign imperialism.

　　With the development of history, this movement gradually reflected the will and hopes of the broad masses of the people, especially the entire peasantry.

　　The great Lenin saw this democratic movement launched by Sun Yat-sen and gave it a high evaluation.

　　There is no doubt that Sun Yat-sen made a great contribution to the victory currently achieved by the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, in the struggle against imperialism and domestic reactionary forces. This first blow to the reactionaries triggered a mass movement of people's awakening, and its first victory began to shake the foundation of imperialism's oppression of China.

　　Sun Yat-sen's great contribution also lies in the fact that he was the first to understand that all democratic and national forces in China must unite with the Communist Party.

　　Sun Yat-sen especially valued and respected our Soviet people and highly valued the great influence of the Russian October Revolution on the cause of liberation of the Chinese people. Until his death, he was always a friend of our Soviet Union. When we had few friends, he was still our friend.

　　Those wise words he said in his famous letter to the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union in 1925 can now be said to be completely confirmed: "I am convinced that your government will continue to give our country the assistance it has given before. Dear comrades! At this moment of parting with you, I would like to express my fervent hope that the dawn will soon break, when the Soviet Union will welcome a strong and independent China as a good friend and ally. The two countries will join hands and advance to victory in the great war for the freedom of the oppressed nations of the world."

　　The victory of the People's Republic of China guarantees the eternal and indestructible friendship between our two great countries and peoples.

　　For world peace, for the equal existence and common development of all people in the world, we establish this friendship with the people's democratic countries and all progressive humanity in the world.

　　Eternal glory to the great Chinese revolutionary Sun Yat-sen! Long live the People's Republic of China headed by Mao Zedong!

　　法捷耶夫演说词
    【新华社南京十五日电】法捷耶夫在中山陵的演说词，全文如下：
    亲爱的朋友们！今天我们苏联文化工作者为了纪念伟大的孙中山，表示崇高的敬意。
    这个杰出的中国民族革命的行动家的名字，是光荣的名字，它已超过了民族范围，而列入世界功臣簿了。
    还在十九世纪末，在中日战争时期，孙中山先生就发动了中国民族解放运动，这个运动立即就带有高尚的爱国主义性质，为中国民族摆脱外国帝国主义的压迫的地位而努力奋斗。
    随着历史的发展，这个运动逐渐反映了广大人民群众首先是整个农民的意志与希望。
    伟大的列宁看见孙中山所发动的这个民主主义性的运动，并给以高尚的估价。
    毫无疑问的，中国人民，在中国共产党领导下，目前所获得的反对帝国主义和国内反动势力斗争的胜利，孙中山是有很大贡献的。这个对反动派的首次打击，引起了人民觉悟的群众运动，它的第一次的胜利开始动摇帝国主义压迫中国的基础。
    孙中山的伟大贡献，还在于他是第一个了解中国一切民主、民族的力量必须与共产党联合起来。
    孙中山对我们苏维埃人民特别看重与尊敬，对俄国十月革命给中国人民解放事业的巨大影响，给以很高估价。一直到他死为止，他始终是我们苏联的朋友。当我们的朋友很少的时候，他仍是我们的朋友。
    在他一九二五年给苏联中央执行委员会的著名的遗书上所说的那些英明的话，现在可以说完全证实了：“我深信你们政府亦必继续前此给予我国之援助。亲爱的同志！当此与你们决别之际，我愿表示我热烈的希望，希望不久即将破晓，斯时苏联以良友及盟国而欢迎强盛独立之中国。两国在争世界被压迫民族自由之大战中，携手并进以取得胜利。”
    中华人民共和国的胜利保证了我们两大国家与人民的永远的不可摧毁的友谊。
    为了世界和平，为了全世界人民平等存在和共同发展，我们与人民民主国家和世界一切进步人类建立这种友谊。
    伟大的中国革命者孙中山永垂不朽！以毛泽东为首的中华人民共和国万岁！
