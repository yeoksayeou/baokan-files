　　To Struggle for Peace—The Primary Task of Intellectuals
    By George Amedo, translated by Du Dao

    The peace struggle of the people of the world, united to prevent the new and monstrous crimes against humanity by the imperialist bloc, has won the firm support of a broad group of intellectuals, first-rate scientists, and literary artists.

    This struggle is not just an emotional outpouring for them, or lip service to pacifist ideas; it is a direct and active participation in the struggle. This fact demonstrates the strength of the peace camp, which, no matter how hard the imperialists try, has won over the vast majority of outstanding intellectuals who are aware of their responsibility for the future of culture.

    This also shows the recognition of the responsibility of today's intellectuals to the people. How long a road has been traveled since the period before and after World War II, when many intellectuals adopted the viewpoint of so-called "Third Way" writers, believing that "a writer should not be involved in politics, he should concentrate on cultivating his own garden, nurturing aesthetic flowers, and ignoring the mundane events happening around him." Many of these intellectuals were well-intentioned, and they truly believed that literature and art were above everyday life.

    We have seen how the war proved the fallacy of this concept and how it changed all intellectuals; not only those who had already stood up to fight against fascism, but we also saw the impact of the war on culture and how it affected the daily lives of the people; their daily problems were real problems, and at the same time, directly related to literature and art. Some writers always avoided and refused to participate in the people's struggle against fascism, against war, and against imperialism; I am reminded of the dramatic suicide of one of them, I am referring to Stefan Zweig, who built a nihilistic world of bourgeois happiness in his works, and whose life was a constant escape from the need for firmness; finally, he wrote a boring book defending Vargas' dictatorship in Brazil. But once confronted with the ugly reality of war, the only solution he could find was to destroy himself. By abandoning the struggle against the war crisis, Zweig ruined his entire future, making him unable to see the future then being created on the Eastern European battlefields by the blood and bravery of the Soviet army.

    The main reason for such a large difference in the status of intellectuals before and after World War II is the brilliant example of Soviet culture and its intellectuals. Soviet culture, the work of its scientists, writers, and artists, has had a great educational significance for intellectuals around the world. Soviet culture has turned wilderness into fertile land, and enabled nations without a vocabulary before the revolution to create a high level of literature; it discusses aesthetic issues beneficial to the country and is engaged in the great task of educating new people and building a new world. These brilliant victories have become an eternal and unswerving model for all of us intellectuals. Intellectuals around the world cannot but compare Soviet culture and the works of its writers and artists with the decadent culture mixed with the cosmopolitan spirit of the imperialists; and compare Soviet science, which serves the cause of peace to build a prosperous and happy life, with the science used to create poverty and death, the science of the atomic bomb.

    The reactionary camp, headed by U.S. imperialism, has launched an ideological offensive in an attempt to portray world culture as two divided groups: Western culture and Eastern culture. Newspapers, radio stations, theaters, and the Vatican are constantly churning out this formula, vainly hoping to divide intellectuals in this way and confine culture behind geographical boundaries. But in vain, the era of casually frightening intellectuals with the specter of communism—the enemy of culture, the degradation and ignorance of the people—is long gone.

    Today, intellectuals know from the example of the Soviet Union that communism is culture, it means the growth of human intellect, communism is another name for science, art, and literature. But the division of world culture presents a very different picture: on the one hand, there is a creative culture of peace, arising from the national characteristics of each nation, and belonging to the whole world; on the other hand, there is a planned exclusion of foreign cultures, replaced by imperialist cosmopolitanism, vulgarity (what could be more vulgar than Hollywood movies?), degeneration, pessimism, and the rejection of true culture.

    In addition to the increasing prestige and influence of Soviet culture among intellectuals in capitalist countries; today, we also have a new culture originating from the various people's democratic countries. For example, the new Polish film industry has grown out of the ruins of cities ravaged by the Nazis, universities and technical schools for the children of workers and peasants have been opened; scientists, writers, and artists have been given the best working environment.

    The fact that intellectuals cannot remain indifferent to such a major international issue as peace explains the success of the World Congress of Intellectuals held in Wrocław (Poland) last year. The Wrocław Congress was the starting point of the struggle. The declaration issued by the Congress, in its firm belief, is by no means mere empty talk on paper, but a heartfelt decision of honest intellectuals around the world; since then, national congresses have been held in many countries. In Latin America, intellectuals in Uruguay were the first to convene a very successful national congress to defend peace. Brazil has also established a national organization for the defense of peace and culture. This organization guides the broad masses of the country in the struggle for peace under the police persecution of the Dutra dictatorship. This peace movement of intellectuals has gained even greater strength since the World Peace Congress in Paris in April.

    The Paris Congress pointed out the necessity of uniting intellectuals in the struggle for peace, and the representatives of 600 million people emphasized how important the work of intellectuals for peace is; how great their responsibility is in the people's struggle against the war crisis created by imperialism. To this end, the Congress has specifically established prizes for literary and artistic works on the theme of peace. This decision of the Paris Congress emphasizes another aspect of the problem: it is not enough for intellectuals to join the peace camp merely as ordinary citizens, while their literary and artistic activities remain isolated. There is nothing more hypocritical than this attempt to play a dual role: on the one hand, fulfilling one's duty as an ordinary citizen in the people's struggle for peace; on the other hand, being a cultural worker who shuts himself in an ivory tower and creates behind closed doors.

    This hypocritical, charming theory, which has numbed a part of the intellectuals for many years, has no right to exist today, it hinders the great power that art can exert in the work of peace. It must be recognized that decadent and abstract art forms, literary formalism and sentimentalism that alienate writers from the people, are all tools used by imperialists to prepare for a new war; they are several forms of ideological struggle, and in fact, they are all anti-peace and anti-people.

    This ideological offensive of war agitators, this existentialist, pessimistic, moribund art aimed at depriving the masses of their will to fight, must be countered with an art that fights for peace, approaches the people, and is permeated with the spirit of anti-imperialist struggle.

    The imperialists know that they no longer have the power to make intellectuals "transcend politics and cultivate their aesthetic gardens," so they reluctantly recruit those right-wing socialist intellectuals who have not yet revealed their true colors to counter the vigorous movement of intellectuals defending peace. The so-called "Anti-War Anti-Dictatorship Conference" held at the Sorbonne shortly after the Paris Peace Congress was a strategy by the imperialists to use Silone, Sartre, and Malraux for their own purposes.

    Because of this, all intellectuals must wholeheartedly devote themselves to the struggle, each contributing their own strengths, especially creative contributions.

    With this understanding of the problem, Latin American writers and other intellectuals who had participated in the Paris Congress issued a declaration to their brothers in Latin American countries, calling on them to strive to be active members in their people's struggle for peace, both as literary writers and as ordinary citizens.

    For the people of Latin America, the struggle for peace is a matter of life and death. War is tantamount to the complete enslavement of our nations and the complete demise of our national cultures, which perfectly explains why any Latin American scientist, writer, or artist who does not put himself and his creative work entirely on the task of peace is deceiving his people, is an intellectual swindler; and at the same time, he is deceiving his work and the culture created in his name.

    I think this concept also applies to other countries. The peace struggle of the people of the world is indivisible. Intellectuals, science, art and literature all have a great task in this struggle. The intellectuals of the Soviet Union have already given us a brilliant example. Tomorrow, when the people have won the battle for peace, and when the imperialist butchers can no longer harm the people, then intellectuals and cultural circles will be able to say that they are worthy of their title, because through their struggle, they have helped the people win peace.

　　为和平而斗争—知识分子的首要任务
    乔治·艾眉多作笃道译
    全世界人民，为了阻止帝国主义集团新的反人类的滔天罪行联合起来的和平斗争，已获得广大知识份子群，第一流科学家，文学艺术家的坚决拥护。
    这一斗争，对他们并不只是情感的流露，或是口头上的太平思想；而是直接主动地参加到斗争中去。这事实显示了和平阵容的强大，不管帝国主义者怎样千方百计，它还是争取了极大多数的优秀知识份子，他们意识到自己对未来文化的责任。
    这一点也显示出今日知识份子这种对人民责任的认识。在二次大战前后，经历了一段多么长的道路，慕尼赫时期，许多知识份子采取了所谓“第三方面”作家的观点，认为“一个作家不应当涉身政治，他应当集中工作栽培自己的园地，抚育美学的花朵，不要理会四周发生的俗事。”这类知识份子很多是好心人，他们真以为文学、艺术高于日常生活。
    我们已经看到，战争怎样证明了这种观念的错误，怎样改变了全部知识份子；不仅是那些早已挺身而出与法西斯作斗争的人，我们也看到了战争给予文化的影响，怎样影响了人民的日常生活；他们的日常问题都是现实的问题，同时与文艺有直接的关连。有些作家对人民反法西斯反战争反帝国主义的斗争总是逃避，不愿意参加；我想起了他们中间一位戏剧式的自杀，我是指兹锐克（Ｓｔｅｆｅｎ　Ζ　ｗｅｉｇ），他在作品中建立起一个虚无的资产阶级幸福的世界，他的生活是从必须坚定中不断的逃避；最后，写了一本无聊的书替华格纳斯（Ｖａｇｌａｓ）在巴西的独裁作辩护。可是一旦碰到丑恶的战争现实，他所能找到的唯一解脱方法只有毁灭自己。由于放弃了反战争危机斗争，兹锐克断送了他的一切前途，使他看不见当时在东欧战场正由苏军的热血与英勇所创造的将来。
    第二次大战前后，知识份子地位所以有这样大的差异，主要是由于苏维埃文化及其知识份子光辉的范例。苏维埃文化，他的科学家、作家、艺术家的工作，对全世界知识份子已有极大的教育意义。苏维埃文化把荒野化成良田，使革命前没有字汇的民族创造出了高度的文学；他讨论有利于国家的美学问题，进行着教育新人类建设新世界的伟大工作。这些辉煌的胜利，已成为我们所有知识份子永恒不移的模范。全世界的知识份子不能不把苏联文化及其作家、艺术家的作品与掺拌了帝国主义者的世界主义精神的腐朽文化作一比较；在服务于和平事业以建立繁荣幸福生活的苏联科学与用以制造穷困与死亡的科学，原子弹的科学之间，作一比较。
    以美帝国主义为首的反动阵营，已经发动了一次思想攻势，企图由此把世界文化描绘成被分割的两个集团：西方文化与东方文化。新闻、电台、剧院、教庭，都在不停地胡搅这一公式，妄想就这样能分化知识份子，把文化钳制在地理疆界之后。但是枉然，拿共产主义魔影——文化的敌人，使人民退化无知——随随便便吓唬知识份子的时代已经过去老远了。
    今天，知识份子由苏联的榜样知道了：共产主义就是文化，就意味着人类智识的增长，共产主义就是科学、艺术、文学的另一称呼。可是世界文化的分隔却呈现出另一幅大不相同的画图：一方面是创造性的和平文化，产生自各民族的民族特性，它属于全世界所有；而另一方面则是有计划地排除异族文化，代之以帝国主义者的世界主义，粗鲁（还有什么东西能比好莱坞的影片更粗俗吗？），堕落，悲观，以及真正文化的排弃。
    除了声望日增，在资本主义国家知识份子间影响日著的苏联文化以外；今天，我们又有了源出于各人民民主国家的新文化。例如新波兰的影片工业，就从纳粹蹂躏过的城市的废墟上成长起来的，大学和为了工农子弟所设的技术学校已经开办了；科学家、作家、艺术家都获得了最好的工作环境。
    对于和平问题这样一个大的国际问题，知识份子不能在一旁漠不开心，这说明去年在罗克劳（Ｗｒｏｃｌａｗ）（波兰）召开的世界知识份子大会的成功。罗克劳大会是斗争的起点。这次大会坚信所发出的宣言绝不仅是纸上空谈，而是全世界诚实的知识份子由衷的决定；自此以后，许多国家都召开了全国大会。在拉丁美洲，乌拉圭的知识份子第一个召开了一次很成功的全国保卫和平大会。巴西也成立了保卫和平与文化的全国性的组织。这组织在杜特拉（Ｄｕｔｒａ）独裁统治的警察迫害下，指导国内广大群众作和平斗争。知识份子这一和平运动，自四月间巴黎世界和平大会以后，获得了更巨大的力量。
    巴黎大会指出在和平斗争中团结知识份子的必要，六万万人民的代表强调了知识份子和平的工作是何等重要；他们在人民反帝国主义所制造的战争危机的斗争中所负的责任何等重大。大会为此，特别替针对和平题材的文艺作品设立了奖金。巴黎大会这一决定又着重了问题的另一面：知识份子参加和平阵营，如果仅仅是以一个平民的身份，而自己的文艺活动却依旧孤立起来，这是不够的。没有比这种扮演双层角色的企图更虚伪的了：一面以平民的资格在人民的和平斗争中尽尽本份；一面又是钻在象牙塔里做闭户造车的文化工作者。
    这一虚伪的，迷人的，许多年来使一部份知识份子麻木的理论，今天已没有存在的权利了，它阻碍了艺术在和平工作中所能发挥的伟大力量。必须认识到：堕落的、抽象的艺术形式，使文艺作家脱离人民的文学上的形式主义和温情主义，都是帝国主义者用以作新战争准备的工具；它们是思想斗争的几种形式，事实上都是反和平反人民的。
    战争煽动者这一思想攻势，这种旨在剥夺群众战斗意志的唯生存论的悲观的，濒于死亡的文艺，必须用一种为和平战斗，接近人民，而且渗透了反帝斗争精神的文艺来反攻。
    帝国主义者知道已经再无力量使知识份子“超然政治之上，栽培他们的美学园地”的可能，于是勉强招来他们那些还没有现出原形的右翼社会主义知识份子以对抗知识份子保卫和平的蓬勃的运动。巴黎和平大会不久以后，在梭巴（Ｓｏｒｂｏｎｎｅ）召开的所谓“反战争反独裁会议”就是帝国主义者为了本身目的，利用西兰（Ｓｉｌｏｎｅ），沙特（Ｓａｒｔｒｅ），马尔劳克斯（Ｍａｌｒａｕｘ）这些家伙的策略。
    由于这一点，所有知识份子必须全心全意投入斗争中，各献所长，尤其是有创造性的贡献。
    对问题作了这样一番理解，拉丁美洲的作家和其他曾经参加巴黎大会的知识份子，向拉丁美洲各国兄弟发出一纸宣言，呼吁他们以文艺作家同时以平民的身份，在他们人民的和平斗争中争取作为积极的一员。
    对于拉丁美洲人民，和平斗争不是他们生死存亡的问题。战争就等于我们各民族的完全被奴役，我们民族文化的全部沦亡，这正好说明了为什么任何拉丁美洲的科学家、作家、艺术家，如果不把他自己和他的创造工作全部放在和平任务上，他就欺骗了他的人民，就是知识骗子；同时也欺骗了他的工作和在他名义下创作的文化。
    我想这种观念也适用于其他国家。全世界人民的和平斗争是不可分割的。知识份子，科学、艺术与文学在这一斗争中都有其伟大的任务。苏联的知识份子已经给我们一个辉煌的榜样。明天，当人民已赢得了和平的战斗，当帝国主义者屠夫们不能再为害人群，那时知识份子和文化界的人们就能够说他们是无愧于自己的称号的了，因为借着他们的斗争，帮助人民赢得了和平。
