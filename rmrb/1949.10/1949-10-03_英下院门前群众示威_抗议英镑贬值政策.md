Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 2nd: London dispatch: The British Labour government's pound devaluation policy, a surrender to American monopoly capital, has aroused the indignation of the broad masses of the British people and intensified the struggle within the reactionary factions. The British Parliament held an emergency meeting on the 27th to debate the devaluation of the pound. When Chancellor of the Exchequer Cripps delivered a speech in the House of Commons defending the devaluation of the pound, a large crowd gathered outside the Parliament building to demonstrate. The protesting demonstrators marched through the main streets of central London, holding signs and calling on the people to participate in a mass demonstration against the pound devaluation in Trafalgar Square on October 9. Prior to the parliamentary debate, Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain, spoke in Sheffield, calling on "workers to launch a counter-offensive, demanding that the government abandon its current traitorous policy and adopt an alternative policy that can guarantee the living standards of the broad masses of the people, prevent large-scale unemployment, and restore our national independence." Communist Party MP Gallacher also strongly condemned the Labour government officials as "traitors" during the House of Commons debate on the pound devaluation. The Conservative Party took the opportunity to launch a large-scale attack on the Labour government during the debate. In the debate the following day (the 28th), Churchill spoke first, fiercely criticizing the government's devaluation measures, demanding that the Labour government resign immediately, and saying that "now is a good time to elect another parliament." Secretary of Commerce Wilson followed, making every effort to defend the Labour government's financial policy.

After three days of intense debate, on the 29th, the Labour Party's majority in the House of Commons rejected the Conservative Party's motion to impeach the government's economic policy by a vote of 350 to 212, and passed a motion of confidence in the government's pound devaluation policy by a vote of 342 to 5. In this vote, only the Communist Party MPs voted against, while Conservative and Liberal Party MPs abstained.

　　英下院门前群众示威
  　抗议英镑贬值政策
    【新华社北京二日电】伦敦讯：英国工党政府向美国垄断资本投降的英镑贬值政策已激起英国广大人民的愤慨，并使反动派内部的斗争更趋激烈。英国会于二十七日举行紧急会议，辩论英镑贬值。当财相克利浦斯在下院发表辩护英镑贬值演说时，广大人群齐集议会门外示威。抗议示威的人群并通过伦敦市中心各大街道，手持标语，号召人民参加十月九日于特拉法加广场举行的抗议英镑贬值的群众示威大会。在议会辩论之前，英共总书记波立特曾在歇非尔德演讲，号召“工人举行反攻，要求政府放弃目前的叛国政策，采取另一种能保障广大人民生活水平，阻止大规模失业及恢复我们民族独立的政策”。英共议员加拉赫于下院辩论英镑贬值时，亦痛斥工党政府人员为“卖艺者”。保守党则乘机于辩论中大肆攻击工党政府。在第二天（二十八日）的辩论中，邱吉尔首先发言，猛抨政府贬值措施，要求工党政府应立即辞职，并说“现在是选举另一届国会的良好时机”。商务大臣威尔逊继起发言，竭力为工党财政政策辩护。
    经过三天激烈辩论后，二十九日工党占多数的下院以三百五十票对二百一十二票否决保守党弹劾政府经济政策的动议案，而以三四二票对五票通过信任政府英镑贬值的政策案。在这一投票中仅共产党议员投反对票，保守党议员与自由党议员均弃权。
