　　Zhang City Implements Emergency Epidemic Prevention
    Citizens Form Epidemic Prevention Groups for Mutual Supervision; Suburban Residents Automatically Isolate Those Arriving from Chahar Province

    [This newspaper's Zhangjiakou dispatch, 28th] All sectors of Zhang City have been urgently mobilized. The city established an Epidemic Prevention Committee on the 25th, announced emergency prevention measures, and issued a notice requiring cadres and citizens to conscientiously comply. Government offices, troops, and schools all held epidemic prevention mobilization meetings and established strict entrance and exit systems. Rooms were also frequently sprinkled with lime or sprayed with carbolic acid solution. Citizens also heightened their vigilance, minimized going out unnecessarily, movie theaters suspended screenings, open-air markets were closed, and the number of pedestrians on the streets decreased significantly. The vast majority of pedestrians wore epidemic prevention masks. Citizens formed an epidemic prevention group for every ten households to supervise each other. Primary schools suspended classes for one month, and middle school students who did not move into the school stopped attending classes. Especially in the suburbs, upon discovering people coming from Chahar Province, the masses automatically immediately isolated themselves from them, confining the newcomers in a house until after the incubation period for plague (ten days), and only releasing them if there were no signs of illness.

    The Northeast China and North China Joint Epidemic Prevention Team, a group of seventy-seven people, arrived in Zhang City on the morning of the 26th and immediately began working intensely. According to Jiang Tao of the Chahar Provincial Health Department: On the 27th and 28th, the epidemic prevention team examined sixty to seventy patients, most of whom had colds, and a few had other illnesses. As of 7:00 PM on the 28th, no signs of plague had been found among patients in Zhang City. Three people recently died suddenly in the urban area of Zhang City, including one man and one woman, who have been dissected by the epidemic prevention team to determine if it was plague; results will be available in three to four days.

    The epidemic situation in Chahar Province has not changed significantly. At 7:00 PM on the 28th, the Zhangbei Epidemic Prevention Headquarters called to report that a woman died outside the Kaidi Fangzi Village in the first district of Kangbao. She came from Chahahan Bengbeng Village. In Shelongtu Village of that district, one family that raised twenty-one pigs had twenty of them die suddenly yesterday. Also, seventeen rat-catching cats in that village also suddenly died yesterday.

　　张市紧急防疫　
    市民成立防疫小组互相监督郊区群众自动隔离察北来人
    【本报二十八日张家口专电】张市各界已紧急动员起来，该市二十五日成立了防疫委员会，宣布紧急预防办法，通令干部市民切实遵行。机关部队学校均召开防疫动员大会，并建立严格的出入门制度，住室内也多撒上石灰或喷上石炭酸水。市民亦提高警惕，无事少外出，影戏院停演，露天市场停市，街上行人已顿形减少，绝大多数行人戴上防疫口罩。市民每十户成立一个防疫小组，彼此互相监督。小学校停课一个月，中等学校走读生不搬入学校者停学。特别是郊区，一发现察北来人，群众便自动立即与之隔绝；并把来人关在一个房子里，等过鼠疫潜期（十天）后确无病象者始行放出。
    东北华北联合防疫队一行七十七人于二十六日晨赶来张市后，立即紧张工作，据察省卫生局长江涛谈：二十七、八两日，防疫队检查了六七十个病人，多系感冒，少数系其他病症，至二十八日下午七时，张市病人中尚未发现鼠疫迹象。张市市区近突死三人，其中有男女各一人已由防疫队解剖，是否鼠疫，尚须待三四天以后才能判明。
    察省病疫情况，无大变化。二十八日晚七时张北防疫指挥部来电话，康保一区开地房子村外，死了一个妇女，她来自察汉崩崩村。该区蛇龙土村一家养猪二十一口，昨突死二十口。又该村之捕鼠猫昨亦突死十七个。
