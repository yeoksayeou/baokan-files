Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 5th. Soong Ching-ling, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, delivered an opening address at the inaugural meeting of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association today. The full text is as follows: I remember thirty-two years ago, when the October Revolution in the Soviet Union shocked the whole world, and this greatest event in human history was subjected to rumors and slanders by all imperialists, Mr. Sun Yat-sen first pointed out: "Since the Russian Revolution, the human race in the world has given birth to a great hope." Yes, this great hope, which arose thirty years ago, has finally had a brilliant development in our motherland today. The October Revolution, led by the greatest revolutionary teachers of mankind, Lenin and Stalin, gave new life to the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people and enabled us to determine the correct direction of relying on the workers and peasants. It should also be said that from that time on, the foundation for the eternal close cooperation between our two great Chinese and Soviet nations was laid. As Mr. Zhongshan said in his deathbed letter to the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union: "In the struggle of the oppressed people of the world for liberation, these two allies must go hand in hand to victory." Now, I feel deeply happy that we have finally personally seen this day. At today's meeting, we naturally recall the fact that the Soviet Union was the first to abolish all unequal treaties with China, recall the assistance we received during the Great Revolution from 1924 to 1927, recall the help we received during the War of Resistance Against Japan, and even more, recall the great friendship of sending troops to the Northeast in 1945 to help us finally eliminate the Japanese Kwantung Army. In our thirty years of arduous struggle against internal and external enemies, only the Soviet Union in the entire world has been the forever unwavering friend of the Chinese people; and this most reliable friend of the Chinese people established diplomatic relations with us on the second day of the establishment of the central government of our new China.

The Chinese people will always remember these precious friendships and help. The Chinese people have learned from thirty years of revolutionary experience the truth pointed out by Chairman Mao Zedong, which is to stand together with the Soviet Union and various new democratic countries. The victory of the Chinese people's revolution has made a significant contribution to safeguarding world peace, but this victory is forever inseparable from the Soviet Union's assistance to us. If we want to safeguard this victory, and if we want to expand this victory so that all the oppressed people in the world can obtain freedom and liberation, then today we must unite more closely with the Soviet Union and strengthen the forces for striving for people's democracy and lasting peace. We firmly believe that as long as the 200 million Soviet people and the 470 million Chinese people work together hand in hand and fight bravely, any reactionary militarist imperialists will surely fall before this great and unparalleled people's power.

"With the Russian Revolution, the human race in the world gave birth to a great hope." Now, with the victory of the Chinese people's revolution, and the united cooperation of the peoples of the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union, the hope for the liberation of all mankind is closer to realization. Let us join hands more closely. Let us fight more resolutely. Our strength is unparalleled and great. The dawn of the whole world is already in sight.

　　宋庆龄开幕词
    【新华社北京五日电】中苏友好协会筹备会主任宋庆龄今日在中苏友好协会成立大会上致开幕词，全文如下：我记得三十二年之前，当苏联的十月革命震惊了整个世界，这个人类史上最伟大的事件遭受到一切帝国主义者的造谣诬蔑的时候，孙中山先生首先指出：“自从有了俄国革命，世界人类便生出一个大希望”。是的，从三十年前产生的这个大希望，今天终于在我们的祖国有了光辉灿烂的发展了。人类最伟大的革命导师列宁、斯大林所领导的十月革命，使我们中国人民的革命事业获得了新的生命，使我们确定了依靠工农群众的正确方向。也应该说，从那时起，我们中苏两大民族之间就奠定了永远亲密合作的基础。诚如中山先生临终给苏联中央执行委员会的遗书中所说：“在全世界被压迫者求解放的斗争中，这两个同盟者必须手携手地走向胜利”。现在，我深深地感到幸福，我们终于亲自看到了这个日子了。在今天这个大会上，我们很自然地回想起苏联首先废除了对中国一切不平等条约的事实，回想起一九二四年至一九二七年大革命时对我们的援助，回想起抗日战争中对我们的帮助，更会回想起一九四五年出兵东北，帮助我们最后消灭日本关东军的这一伟大友谊。在我们三十年来对内外敌人的艰苦斗争中，整个世界上只有苏联是我们中国人民的永远不渝的朋友；而这个中国人民的最可靠的朋友，今天又在我们新中国中央政府成立的第二天，首先和我们建立外交关系了。
    中国人民将永远铭记住这一些宝贵的友谊和帮助。中国人民已经从三十年的革命经验中，认识了毛泽东主席所指示的和苏联及各新民主国家站在一起的真理。中国人民革命的胜利，对保障世界和平作了重大的贡献，但是这胜利，是和苏联对我们的援助永远分不开的。我们要保障这一胜利，我们要使这一胜利扩大到全世界被压迫的人民都获得自由解放，那么我们今天就必须更紧密地和苏联团结起来，加强争取人民民主和持久和平的力量。我们坚信只要两万万苏联人民和四万万七千万中国人民携手合作，英勇斗争，任何反动黩武的帝国主义者，一定会在这伟大无比的人民力量面前倒下去的。
    “有了俄国革命，世界人类便生出一个大希望”，现在，有了中国人民革命的胜利，和中苏两大国家的人民的团结合作，全人类解放的希望就更加接近实现了。让我们更紧密地携手吧。让我们更坚决地斗争吧。我们的力量是无比的伟大。全世界破晓的时候，已经在眼前了。
