Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 28th: According to TASS, New York: Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky delivered an important speech at the United Nations General Assembly on the 21st, thoroughly exposing the US-British bloc's slanderous acts against Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania in the role of accuser of accusers; and proving with facts that the real violators of human rights are capitalist countries such as Britain and the United States.

Vyshinsky said: "It has been proven that the condemnation of Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania for violating human rights and fundamental freedoms is completely unfounded. However, the majority of the Special Political Committee passed a resolution that is now submitted to the General Assembly for consideration. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze this unreasonable slander again. The crusade against the people's democratic systems of Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania is planned and carried out along three main lines: First, the slanderous arguments about the so-called violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms by the governments of the aforementioned three countries; this is the first line. Second, similar arguments about violating treaties; this is the second line. Third, similar arguments about violating international obligations; this is the third line."

Vyshinsky asserted: The accusers have absolutely no evidence on any of these three lines. Vyshinsky pointed out: The gentlemen of the Anglo-American camp have tried their best to discredit the trials of Petkov, Mindszenty, and Maniu. US representative Shawcross slandered on October 6th, saying that in countries like Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania, people arrested for political reasons are never tried unless they confess before the trial. Later, on October 12th, he revised his statement, saying that this was not the case in all trials, but he asserted that these confessions were made under coercion. This British Attorney General himself launched arrows at the people's democratic countries, while praising "mature legal systems," such as the British system. According to Shawcross, the courts there handle the confessions of the accused very carefully. Vyshinsky listed British laws from the Middle Ages to prove that it was precisely in Britain that the confessions of the accused played a decisive role in the trial. Conversely, in the people's democratic countries of Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania, the confessions of the accused are not regarded as more important than any other evidence, and the courts there make judgments based on all the evidence. Shawcross also said that the Hungarian Minister of Justice had said somewhere, sometime (but he did not say where or when): One of the methods of giving evidence in Hungary is the political position of the accused. This is slander, saying that in Hungary, people are tried not because they have committed a crime, but because of their political views. Vyshinsky cited the Mindszenty case as an example to expose this slander. Mindszenty's treason was proven not only by his own confession of the crimes he had committed, but also by the evidence unearthed from the iron box in the basement of his residence, which contained a list written in Mindszenty's own handwriting of the members of the future government who would govern under the leadership of Mindszenty and his Anglo-American masters after the existing legitimate government of Hungary was overthrown by force.

Vyshinsky further powerfully pointed out: "It is most noteworthy that all these unjust attacks on the political system of Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania, on the judiciary, on the so-called lack of rights and freedoms in Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania, come mostly from the governments of those countries where human rights and freedoms are completely destroyed." In Britain, there is a law of August 22, 1911, which states that in cases involving state secrets, there is no need to prove that certain actions were taken to threaten the security of national interests in order to determine the guilt of the accused. Therefore, British courts can convict the accused on this basis, even if no specific crime has been established. In Australia, the local people are in a state of slavery. Vyshinsky said: "Is it not strange that the Australian representative completely ignores the tragic and rightless situation of the Australians, but, as the resolution of the majority of the Political Committee says, is 'seriously concerned' about the so-called 'violation' of rights in the people's democratic countries? The ruling clique of the Netherlands is carrying out a war of aggression against the Indonesian people, and the Dutch representative who speaks here is a typical representative of these slave owners who express 'concern.' He demands a crusade against democratic countries, and he openly demands here that the United Nations General Assembly unite to carry out the struggle against communism. Everyone knows that this kind of attempt to organize a crusade against democracy and socialism has happened in the past. One can recall the attempt by the reactionary group of capitalist countries, led by Churchill, to organize a fourteen-nation crusade against the Soviet Union, and this crusade ended in a miserable defeat. The Dutch representative can be sure that if this attempt failed thirty years ago, then it will fail even more miserably now. It is truly a sight that the slave owners and their masters are playing the role of democratic teachers, and the role of defenders of human rights and fundamental freedoms for other truly advanced democratic countries! Precisely in Australia, the Federal Criminal Law completely destroys rights and freedoms, deprives citizens of the right to trial by jury, and deprives the accused of the right to ask questions and answer questions to the prosecutor. At this time, it is a disgrace to hear the Australian representative talk about the judiciary of Romania! On this point, we must talk about Greece, its fascist terror, its barbaric torture and execution of patriots; we must talk about the United States and its so-called "human rights," about its human rights in Peekskill and other places in the United States, or as demonstrated by Judge Medina. Judge Medina even deprived the accused of the right to defend themselves, and he not only hastily convicted the accused, but also convicted the defense lawyers together! On this point, we must talk about Britain, which massacres peaceful demonstrators - such as in Somaliland. We must talk about the unbridled propaganda about new wars and the mass destruction of people carried out in the United States and Britain; we must talk about Britain giving freedom of speech to fascists, etc. One cannot fail to notice Cohen's speech here, in which he said that the Soviet Union's proposal against preparing for new wars and concluding a five-power treaty to strengthen peace was unacceptable to the United States. The proposal to strengthen peace is naturally unacceptable to those who are preparing for war. Here, one can also remind the British Attorney General, who preaches democracy, freedom, and human rights at the UN General Assembly, for example, remind him of the sensational trial of the most advanced leader of the Indian trade union movement, which was described at the time by the British "New Leader" magazine as the biggest scandal in political persecution, the most shameful thing in the history of world justice!

Vyshinsky said: As for insisting that Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania's legal punishment of traitors is a violation of the treaty, that is ridiculous. It is as if the treaty is meant to protect the "right" to commit crimes or the "freedom" to commit crimes. In fact, the treaty directly requires the governments of Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania to prevent the existence and activities of fascist organizations that aim to deprive the people of their democratic rights and engage in activities hostile to the Soviet Union and any other member of the United Nations. Therefore, the so-called violation of the treaty is purely a fabrication, in order to give some excuse to the crusade against these three people's democratic countries. This crusade is organized according to all the laws of savagery, and it conceals all the arbitrary acts and lawless things. This savage law is well described in Krylov's famous fable "The Wolf and the Lamb": "I am hungry, it is your fault."

After citing the facts that the US and Britain have tried to interfere in the internal affairs of Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania in the past, Vyshinsky went on to analyze the basic reason why the US and British capitalist countries are attempting to interfere in the internal affairs of these countries again under the pretext of human rights issues: The establishment of people's democratic systems and people's democratic countries has separated the countries of Eastern and Southeastern Europe from the capitalist system. The people's democratic countries are responsible for ensuring the development of these countries along the socialist road during the transitional period. The capitalist countries are trying every means to oppose the consolidation of this people's democratic system, and they dream of reversing the wheel of history, or at least hindering its progress. Vyshinsky said: In order to cover up, they rely on obvious distortions of the United Nations Charter, such as attempting to invoke Article 55 of the Charter, although this article does not stipulate any right to interfere in the internal affairs of independent countries.

Finally, Vyshinsky denounced the proposal to request the International Court of Justice to provide advisory opinions. He said: The so-called dispute does not exist. Because the treaties with Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary stipulate that if a dispute arises between Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania (one party) and the US, Britain, and the Soviet Union (one party) on the issue of fulfilling and interpreting the treaty, the three major powers of the US, Britain, and the Soviet Union should act in agreement. There is no such agreement at present, because the Soviet Union believes that the governments of Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania are fulfilling the treaty very honestly and promptly, and that no deviation is allowed in the fulfillment of the treaty. Therefore, there is no basis for saying that there is any dispute. Therefore, there is no reason to seek an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice on the issue of the existence of a dispute. Vyshinsky said: "The unreasonable slander campaign against the three people's democratic countries, like the motion submitted to the General Assembly for consideration by the majority of the Political Committee, follows suspicious aims. The Soviet delegation opposes this motion and firmly insists on rejecting it, because passing such a resolution would encourage slanderers and falsifiers who infringe on the sovereignty of independent democratic countries. This is not allowed."

　　维辛斯基在联大发表重要演说揭发美英毁谤保匈罗可耻阴谋   
    指出侵犯人权者正是美英及其喽罗
    【新华社北京二十八日电】据塔斯社纽约讯：苏联外长维辛斯基在二十一日联合国大会全会上发表重要演说，以控诉者之控诉者的身份，彻底揭发美英集团毁谤保、匈、罗的行为；并且以事实证明，真正侵犯人权者是英美等资本主义国家。
    维辛斯基说：“业已证明，谴责保、匈、罗侵犯人权和基本自由，是绝无根据的。然而特别政治委员会的多数方面却通过了现在提交联大考虑的决议。因此，必须再来分析这种无理的诽谤。对保、匈、罗三国人民民主制度的十字军，是按着三条主要方针来计划和进行的：一、对于上述三国政府的所谓侵犯人权和基本自由的诽谤性论调，这是第一条方针；二、关于违背和约的类似的论调，这是第二条方针；三、关于违背国际义务的类似论调，这是第三条方针。”
    维辛斯基断言：谴责者绝对没有关于这三条中任何一条的证据。维辛斯基指出：英美阵营的绅士们竭力诋毁对彼得科夫、明曾蒂、马尼乌的审判案。美国代表萧克洛斯在十月六日诽谤说，在保、匈、罗这些国家里，一般因政治理由而被捕的人，如果他们不是在审讯之前服罪的话，从不审判。后来在十月十二日他又修正说，不是在所有的审判中都是这样的，但他肯定说，这些口供是在胁迫之下造成的。这位英国总检察长自己放出箭头射向人民民主国家，同时则称赞“成熟的法律制度”，例如英国的制度。据萧克洛斯说，在那里法庭很慎重地处理被告的口供。维辛斯基列举中世纪以来的英国法律，来证明正是在英国，被告的口供在审讯中起着决定的作用。反之，在保、匈、罗人民民主国家里，对于被告的供状，并不比任何其他的证明看得更重要些，那里的法庭是根据全部证据来进行判决的。萧克洛斯又说什么匈牙利司法部长曾在某地某时（可是他却不说在什么地方什么时候）说过：在匈牙利作证的方法之一，便是被告的政治立场。这就是诽谤说：在匈牙利，人们之受审，不是因为犯了罪，而是因为他们的政见。维辛斯基举出明曾蒂案件为例，来揭穿这种诽谤。明曾蒂的叛国罪，不仅由其对所犯罪状的自供，而且也由其住宅地下室中掘出的铁箱中的证据而证明了，这个铁箱内有明曾蒂亲笔写的在用武力推翻匈牙利现存合法政府后，在明曾蒂及其英美主子领导下执政的未来政府成员的名单。
    维辛斯基进一步有力地指出：“最值得注意的是，所有这些对于保、匈、罗政治制度的，对于司法的，对于所谓保、匈、罗没有权利与自由的不公正的攻击，大部分出自人权和自由完全被摧残的那些国家的政府”。在英国，有一条一九一一年八月二十二日的法律说：如遇有关国家机密的案情，无需证明有威胁国家利益安全这一目的某些确定行动来决定被告之罪。因此，英国法庭可以据此判决被告，即使并未确立具体的罪行也可以。在澳洲，本地人民是处在奴隶的状态中。维辛斯基说：“澳洲代表对于澳洲人的悲惨的毫无权利的情形竟毫不在意，而象政治委员会多数方面的决议案所说的，却“严重关心”所谓人民民主国家“侵犯”权利的行为，这岂不奇怪吗？荷兰的统治集团对印尼人民进行侵略战争，在这里讲话的荷兰代表就是这些表示“关心”的奴隶主的典型的代表。他要求以十字军对付民主国家，他在这里公开要求联合国大会团结起来进行反共产主义的斗争。大家知道，这种组织十字军反对民主与社会主义的企图，在过去曾发生过。人们可以回想到资本主义国家以邱吉尔为首的反动集团组织十四国的十字军反对苏联的企图，这个十字军惨败了。荷兰代表可以肯定：如果这种企图在三十年前失败了，那末现在会失败得更惨。奴隶主及其主子竟扮演民主导师，这对于别的真正先进民主国家的人权与基本自由的维护者的角色——真是天晓得的景象！恰恰是在澳洲，联邦刑法完全破坏了权利与自由，剥夺了公民由陪审团审判的权利，剥夺了被告向检察官提出问题和答复问题的权利。在这时来听澳洲代表侈谈罗马尼亚的司法，这是一种耻辱！关于这一点，必须讲到希腊，它的法西斯恐怖，它的野蛮的酷刑和处死爱国人士；必须讲到美国和它的所谓“人权”，讲到它的人权在毕克斯吉尔和美国其他地方，或者由法官麦迪纳所表明了。麦迪纳法官甚至剥夺了被告的辩护权利，他不仅仓惶地将被告定罪，而且把被告的辩护律师也一起定罪！关于这一点，必须讲到英国，它屠杀和平的示威者——例如在索马利兰。必须讲到在美英两国所进行的放肆的关于新战争和大量消灭人民的宣传；必须讲到英国给法西斯分子以言论自由等等。人们不能不注意到柯亨在这里的发言，他说苏联所提出的反对准备新战争和缔结五强条约以加强和平的提议，为美国所不能接受。加强和平的提议，自然是准备战争的人所不能接受的。这里也可以提醒在联大会议上宣讲民主自由和人权的英国检察长，例如说，提醒他对印度工会运动最先进领袖的哄动一时的审讯，这次审讯被英国的“新领袖”杂志当时形容为政治迫害中最大丑事，世界司法史上最可耻的丑事！
    维辛斯基说：至于硬说保、匈、罗依法惩办叛国分子是违反和约，那是可笑的。好象和约是要保护犯罪的“权利”或犯罪的“自由”似的。事实上，和约是直接责成保、匈、罗政府，防止那种以剥夺人民民主权利为目的、并从事仇视苏联及任何其他联合国会员国之活动的法西斯组织之存在与活动。所以，所谓违反和约，纯然是出于捏造，为的是要多少给反对这三个人民民主国家的十字军，我一点口实，这个十字军是按照野蛮法律的一切法则而组织起来的，它把所有的专断行为和毫无法纪的事情都隐蔽起来。这个野蛮法律在克里洛夫的著名的寓言“狼和羔羊”里面有很好的描写：“我肚子饿，是你的过错。”
    维辛斯基在举出美英过去力图干涉保、匈、罗内政的事实之后，接着分析美英资本主义国家借口人权问题复图干涉这些国家的内政的基本原因称：人民民主制度和人民民主国家的成立，使得东欧与东南欧国家脱离了资本主义制度。人民民主国家乃是负责保证这些国家沿着社会主义道路发展的过渡时期的国家。资本主义国家正用尽各种方法，企图反对这人民民主制度的巩固，他们梦想扭转历史的巨轮，或者至少也要阻挠其前进。维辛斯基说：为了掩饰，他们便依恃对联合国宪章明显的歪曲，例如企图引用宪章第五十五条，虽然这一条不曾规定有对独立国家的内政作任何干涉的权利。
    最后，维辛斯基指斥了要求国际法庭提供咨询性意见的建议。他说：所谓争议是不存在的。因为对罗、对保、对匈的和约规定，如果在履行与解释和约的问题上保、匈、罗（一方）与美、英、苏（一方）发生争执时，美英苏三大国应该协议行动。目前并没有这种协议，因为苏联认为保、匈、罗三国政府正很诚实敏捷地履行和约，并且在履行和约上不容许有任何偏差。所以，没有任何根据说有什么争议。因此也没有理由向国际法庭征求关于争议存在问题的咨询性意见。维辛斯基说：“对三个人民民主国家的无理的诽谤运动，与政治委员会多数方面提交大会考虑的议案一样，遵循着可疑的目的。苏联代表团反对这一议案，坚决主张拒绝这一议案，因为通过此种决议，便会鼓励侵害独立民主国家底主权的诽谤者和伪造者。这是不可容许的。”
