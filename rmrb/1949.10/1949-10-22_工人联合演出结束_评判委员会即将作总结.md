　　Workers' Joint Performance Concludes
  　Judging Committee to Summarize Soon
    [From Our Newspaper] The Workers' Joint Performance, sponsored by the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, concluded successfully on the 21st. It ran for six nights starting from the 16th, with each night packed with worker audiences. The performance included dramas, operas, quick-talk shows, singing, waist drum dances, and more. Among them, songs and plays created and performed by the workers themselves were especially popular with the audience. For example, the drama "Production Increases by an Inch," collectively created by workers of the 70th Ordnance Factory, the drama "Great Unity for Brightness," collectively created by workers of the Shijingshan Power Plant, and the quick-talk show "Furnace Welding Plant," collectively created by workers of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, were all works with considerable artistic level and ideological significance. "Production Increases by an Inch" depicts how the 70th Ordnance Factory overcame incorrect leadership in the process of resuming production, promoted the workers' initiative, repaired the steam hammer, and launched a production competition, enabling production to recover and increase rapidly. It appropriately criticized certain shortcomings and vividly pointed out that the correct leadership of the Party finally overcame difficulties and improved production.
    In this performance, the scripts created by the workers themselves generally showed great progress. The structure of "Production Increases by an Inch" from the 70th Ordnance Factory was also very concise. The script appropriately and vividly expressed the struggle between backwardness and progress, error and correctness, reaching a considerable political level. The Judging Committee will soon hold a meeting to summarize the gains of this performance and select excellent works to participate in the performance to welcome representatives of the Asian-Australian Workers' Conference.

　　工人联合演出结束
  　评判委员会即将作总结
    【本报讯】北京市总工会筹委会所主办的工人联合演出已于二十一日圆满结束。自十六日起一共演了六晚，每晚都挤满职工观众。演出内容有话剧、歌剧、快板剧、歌咏、腰鼓等，其中有不少工人自己创作自己演出的歌与剧，更受观众欢迎。如七十兵工厂工人集体创作的话剧“生产长一寸”，石景山发电厂工人的集体创作话剧“为了光明大团结”，石景山钢铁厂工人的集体创作快板剧“炉焊厂”，都是相当具有艺术水平与思想性的作品。“生产长一寸”描写七十兵工厂在恢复生产中如何克服错误的领导，发扬了工人的积极性，修好汽锤，并发起生产竞赛，使生产迅速恢复与提高。它适当地批判了某些缺点，并生动地指出党的正确领导，终于克服了困难，提高了生产。
    这次演出中，工友们自己创作的剧本，一般都有很大的进步。七十兵工厂的“生产长一寸”在结构上也十分精练。剧本中适当地并形象地表现了落后与前进，错误与正确之间的斗争，达到了相当的政治水平。评判委员会最近就要开会总结这次演出的收获，并将选出优良的作品参加迎接亚澳职工代表会议各国代表的演出。
