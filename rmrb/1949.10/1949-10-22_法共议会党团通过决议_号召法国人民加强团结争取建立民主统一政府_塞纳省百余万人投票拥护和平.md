Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 21st -- TASS, Paris: The French Communist Party Parliamentary Group held a meeting on the 18th, presided over by Duclos, and passed a resolution stating: "The Communist Parliamentary Group emphasizes: the protracted government crisis, which is greatly harmful to the interests of the country, is due to the reactionary diehards' stubborn refusal to meet the legitimate demands of the workers. The working people, united in various trade union organizations, unanimously demand an increase in wages -- a demand that is fully justified due to the undeniable reduction in the purchasing power of the working people." The resolution emphasizes that unemployment is increasing in France, and the laboring masses are becoming increasingly impoverished. The resolution also points out: "The interests of France require giving jobs to the unemployed, preferential treatment to small and medium taxpayers, and increased taxes on capitalist companies that obtain huge profits."

The resolution also calls on the government to pursue a fair social security policy, and states: "The Communist Parliamentary Group believes that a policy of social justice is possible, as long as the French government abandons the Vietnam War and abandons preparations for war against the Soviet Union -- which cost hundreds of billions of francs. ...The Communist Parliamentary Group, representing the true interests of France, declares: only by establishing a democratic and unified government, implementing a policy of social progress and defending republican freedoms, national independence, and a policy that guarantees a decent life for all French people, can the existing problems be solved." "The Communist Parliamentary Group calls on all French people to unite, so as to achieve the establishment of such a government that truly serves the people through their joint action."

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 21st -- Telepress, Paris, 18th: In the French national movement to support peace, more than one million people in the Seine department alone voted in support of peace. Representatives of the municipal councils of the Seine department expressed their satisfaction with this and issued the following statement: "We have decided to intensify our efforts to ensure that all the people, between now and October 23 (the deadline for the peace vote campaign), show their will to support peace through massive voting. At the same time, in order to demonstrate this will, we agree to continue the struggle until France has a government that pursues a policy of peace, a policy of national independence, a policy of respecting constitutional freedoms, and a policy of guaranteeing a decent life for all French people."

　　法共议会党团通过决议
  　号召法国人民加强团结争取建立民主统一政府
    塞纳省百余万人投票拥护和平
    【新华社北京二十一日电】塔斯社巴黎讯：法国国民议会共产党党团于十八日在杜克洛主持下举行会议，并通过决议称：“共产党国会党团强调：对国家利益有巨大危害的政府危机的拖延不决，其原因是由于反动派死硬地拒绝满足工人的合法要求。联合在各不同职工会组织内的劳动人民，一致要求增加工资——这一要求因劳动人民购买力的无可置辩的降低，是完全具有正当理由的。”决议强调失业人数在法国正日益增加，劳动群众正日益贫困。决议并指出：“法国的利益要求给失业者以职业，给中小纳税者以优待，并对获得巨大利润的资本家公司增加课税。”
    决议并要求政府奉行公平的社会安全政策，并称：“共产党国会党团认为：社会公正的政策是可能的，只要法国政府放弃越南战争，放弃准备对苏战争——这些花费共达数千亿法郎。……代表法国真正利益的共产党国会党团宣称：只有建立民主统一政府，推行社会进步和保卫共和自由、国家独立以及和平的政策，那么，现存问题才能解决。”“共产党国会党团号召一切法国人团结起来，以便借其联合行动达到建立这样一个真正为人民服务的政府。”
    【新华社北京二十一日电】电通社巴黎十八日讯：在法国全国拥护和平运动中，仅塞纳省一省就有一百多万人投票拥护和平。塞纳省市镇议会的代表们对此表示满意，并发表声明如下：“我们已决定加紧我们的努力，使全体人民在目前至十月二十三日（和平投票运动截止期）之间，以大量投票来表明他们拥护和平的意志。同时，为了表明这一意志，我们约定继续斗争，直到法国有一个奉行和平政策、民族独立政策、尊重宪法自由的政策、保证一切法国人民有适当生活的政策的政府为止。”
