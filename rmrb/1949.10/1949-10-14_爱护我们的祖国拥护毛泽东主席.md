　　Love Our Motherland, Support Chairman Mao Zedong
　　Jiang Nanxiang, Deputy Secretary of the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League
　　From September 21st to 30th, the first plenary session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference was held in Beijing. At this meeting, the founding of the People's Republic of China was proclaimed, Beijing was designated as the capital of our new China, the five-star red flag was adopted as the national flag of our new China, the March of the Volunteers was adopted as our current national anthem, and our most beloved Chairman Mao was elected as the Chairman of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China.
　　The new China led by Chairman Mao—the People's Republic of China—is officially born. This is a major event unprecedented in China's five-thousand-year history.
　　The old Republic of China, when the Kuomintang reactionaries were in power, although nominally bearing the signboard of "Republic," actually deprived the people of all freedom and rights. The common people gained nothing, and the only beneficiaries were a small number of Kuomintang reactionaries and their accomplices who oppressed the people. They colluded with imperialists, betrayed the country and the nation, profited from national disasters, profited from takeovers, and extorted and exploited the people of the whole country, forcing countless people to be without clothing or food, and causing families to be broken and destroyed. They, on the other hand, sucked the people's blood and lived an extremely luxurious and decadent life.
　　The current People's Republic of China is a new China where the people are the masters, and it is completely different from the old Republic of China of the past. In our new China, the forces of American imperialism that invaded our China, the Kuomintang's four big families and all reactionary forces that oppressed and exploited the broad masses of the Chinese people, have all lost their positions. China has become a truly independent country. Today, it enjoys high prestige internationally and is warmly respected by the progressive people of the world. No one dares to bully us anymore. China has become a truly democratic country. The vast majority of the Chinese people—workers, peasants, intellectuals, petty bourgeoisie, and national bourgeoisie—all enjoy full democratic rights, but we are not polite to the very few traitors and reactionaries. We will give them a merciless blow and not allow them to speak or act recklessly, continuing to harm the country and the people. Just as Chairman Mao has told us, now the four hundred seventy-five million Chinese people have stood up!
　　It is truly not a simple matter for a country with such a large population as China to achieve liberation. In order to build such an independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, and prosperous new China, our revolutionary predecessors shed blood and sweat, and advanced wave upon wave, fighting for more than a hundred years. It was not until after the October Revolution in the Soviet Union and the May Fourth Movement in China that China had the Communist Party and the revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, which enabled the Chinese revolution to have correct leadership. After nearly thirty years of arduous struggle, and with the consistent sympathy and support of the Soviet Union and revolutionary forces around the world, victory was finally achieved.
　　In the future, only under the strong leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao can we build an independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, and prosperous new China, make Chinese society progress rapidly, and enable young people and children to have a bright future.
　　Therefore, we must love our motherland—the People's Republic of China.
　　We must love our leader and mentor—Chairman Mao Zedong.
　　We must respect the symbols of our motherland—the national flag and the national anthem. When we raise and lower the national flag, we must stand at attention and salute. When we sing our national anthem, we must be neat and solemn.
　　We must study hard, constantly strive for progress, and work hard to create a more glorious future for our motherland!

### 爱护我们的祖国拥护毛泽东主席

　　爱护我们的祖国拥护毛泽东主席
    中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会副书记  蒋南翔
    九月二十一号到三十号，中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议，在北京开了会，在这个会议上，宣告了中华人民共和国的成立，决定了以北京作为我们新中国的首都，制定了五星红旗作为我们新中国的国旗，采用了义勇军进行曲作为我们现时的国歌，并且选举了我们最敬爱的毛主席做我们中华人民共和国中央人民政府的主席。
    毛主席领导的新中国——中华人民共和国正式诞生了，这是我们中国五千年历史上从来没有过的一件大事情。
    过去国民党反动派当权的旧中华民国，虽然在名义上挂着“民国”的招牌，但是实际上是剥夺了人民的一切自由和权利，老百姓得不到什么好处，得到好处的只是一小撮欺压老百姓的国民党反动派和他们的帮凶们。他们勾结帝国主义，出卖国家民族，发国难财，发接收财，敲诈剥削全国老百姓，逼得多少人无衣无食，家破人亡。他们则吸着老百姓的膏血，过着极端奢侈腐化的生活。
    现在的中华人民共和国，是人民做了主人的新中国，和过去的旧中华民国就完全不同了。在我们这个新中国，侵略我们中国的美帝国主义势力，欺压剥削中国广大人民的国民党四大家族和一切反动势力，都丧失了他们的地位。中国成为真正独立的国家了，如今在国际上有着很高的威信，受到全世界进步人民的热烈尊敬，谁也不敢再欺侮我们。中国成了真正民主的国家了，全中国绝大多数的人民——工人、农民、知识分子、小资产阶级、民族资产阶级，都享有了充分的民主权利，只对极少数卖国贼和反动派不客气，要给他们无情的打击，不许他们乱说乱动，继续危害国家和人民。正象毛主席所告诉我们的，现在四万万七千五百万中国人民是站起来了！
    象我们中国这样一位人口众多的国家获得解放，真不是一件简单的事情。为了要建立这样一个独立、民主、和平、统一和富强的新中国，我们的革命前辈们，曾经流血流汗，前仆后继，整整奋斗了一百多年；直到苏联的十月革命和中国的五四运动以后，中国有了共产党，有了革命领袖毛泽东，才使中国革命有了正确的领导，经过了将近三十年的艰苦奋斗，又得到苏联和全世界革命力量一贯地同情和支持，终于取得了胜利。
    今后也只有在共产党和毛主席的坚强领导下，才能够建设起独立、民主、和平、统一和富强的新中国，使中国社会很快地进步，使青年和儿童都能有光明的前途。
    因此，我们要爱我们的祖国——中华人民共和国。
    我们要爱我们的领袖和导师——毛泽东主席。
    我们要尊敬我们祖国的象征——国旗和国歌。当我们升起和降落国旗的时候，要立正致敬。当我们歌唱我们的国歌的时候，要整齐严肃。
    我们要好好地学习，不断地求进步，为创造我们祖国底更光荣的未来而努力！
