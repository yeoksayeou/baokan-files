　　A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the suburbs of Beijing recently suspended military exercises for three days to help farmers with the harvest and planting. A total of 20,094 personnel and 823 livestock participated, achieving the following results: transporting crops from 2,938 mu and 566 large carts, carrying sorghum stalks by manpower 3,464 times, harvesting 13,273 mu of millet, beans, sesame, threshing sorghum, and bundling sorghum stalks, plowing and harrowing 7,225 mu, planting wheat on 360.5 mu, clearing weeds (in areas with deep weeds unsuitable for wheat planting) on 121 mu, watering gardens on 4 mu, delivering manure in 501 large carts, pushing manure in 76 small carts, carrying manure 1,131 loads, transporting manure in 45 large carts, and husking corn on 12 mu and 65 large carts. In addition, during the period of helping farmers with the harvest and planting, they universally promoted policies to the masses, as well as the victory news of our various armies, and educated the people to work hard in production, practice thrift, and overcome natural disasters.

　　In this movement, many models emerged. Many comrades had blisters on their hands, aching backs and legs, and even while ill, they still actively competed to work hard. Liu Jisheng, Zou Wanguo, and Zhang Hongfang from the Fourth Company, bare-chested and barefoot, completed the task of pulling and carrying corn from eight mu in less than a day. Some units in the artillery battalion, after finishing their work in the fields during the day, still husked corn for one or two hours before going to bed at night. Zhou Yun, Huang Zhenya, Li Wensheng, and others, the feeders from the political department, helped pull the carts when the livestock could not move them on the muddy roads, regardless of the mud. All of this demonstrated the comrades' enthusiasm for production.

　　But the greater gain of this work was the closer relationship between the army and the people. An old lady bought cigarettes and cooked corn and sweet potatoes to give to the soldiers to eat. The soldiers politely declined. Feeling bad about this, the old lady automatically took the quilts from the soldiers' beds and washed them. Fan Rong from Fanjiapo said, "The People's Liberation Army is really good. If it were the Central Army, they would not only not help us, but they would also come to beat us, scold us, and rob us every day." The old man Fan Yu said, "You help me with my work like this, without eating my food or drinking my water. This team is truly rare." Military dependent Old Lady Fan said, "If it weren't for our army helping, I wouldn't be able to finish it in half a month." Chen Niu'er's mother said, "The hearts of the People's Liberation Army are all so good. You helped me with my work, and the money saved is enough for me to live for five or six days. We are truly one family."

　　驻京郊解放军某部
    助民收种两万亩
    群众认为是少有的好队伍
    【本报讯】驻京郊某部解放军，日前全军一律停止操课三天，助农收种，共计参加二○○九四人，牲口八二三头，做出了以下成绩；运输庄稼二九三八亩又五六六大车，人力扛秫秸三四六四个，割谷子、豆子、芝麻、捣秫秸、捆打秫秸共收割一三二七三亩，耕耙地七二二五亩，种麦三六○·五亩，拔草（草深不能种麦之地）一二一亩，浇园四亩，送粪五○一大车，推粪七六小车，担粪一一三一担，过粪四五大车，剥玉蜀皮一二亩又六五大车。另外，并在助农收种期间，普遍的向群众宣传了政策，及我各路大军的胜利消息，教育人民努力生产节约，战胜灾荒等。
    在这个运动里，涌现了不少模范，很多同志手上打了泡，腰疼腿疼带着病，还争先恐后的积极干。四连刘冀生、邹万国、张洪芳，光着膀子赤着脚，不到一天时间，八亩玉蜀黍连拔带担弄完了。炮营有的单位，白天做完了地里活，晚上睡觉前还剥一两个钟头的玉蜀皮。政治部饲养员周云、黄振亚、李文生等，在泥水道上，牲口拉不动车时，他们便不顾泥泞帮助拉。这都表现了同志们的生产热情。
    但这个工作的更大收获是密切了军民关系，一位老大娘，买了纸烟，煮熟了玉米、红薯送给战士们吃。被战士们婉言谢绝了。老大娘过意不去，自动到战士炕上拿了被子拆洗。范家坡范荣说：“解放军真好，若是中央军，不但不帮助俺，还整天来打俺骂俺抢东西呢。”老汉范玉说：“你们这样帮助我做活，不吃我的饭，也不喝水，这队伍真是少有。”军属范老太太说：“若不是咱们军队帮助做，我半月也做不完。”陈牛儿的母亲说：“解放军的心都是这样好。你们帮助我做活，省的钱够我生活五六天的。咱们真是一家人。”
