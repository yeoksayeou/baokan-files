　　The Jubilant City of Xi'an
　　By our special correspondent, Ming Tian

　　Victorious shouts, shouts supporting Chairman Mao, and shouts resolutely defending peace resounded throughout the Northwest Plateau, resounding throughout Xi'an, the political, economic, and cultural center of the Northwest. October 2nd—a day of common celebration and struggle for progressive people worldwide—saw 600,000 people of Xi'an plunged into unparalleled jubilation and resolute action. They celebrated the great motherland's entry into a new era of freedom and happiness, they hated the imperialist warmongers, and they were determined to express their unwavering will to defend peace through action. The ancient city of Xi'an, forty li square, was decorated beautifully and solemnly on this day with countless bright red banners sparkling like stars, and countless tall and magnificent colorful arches. Although it had been raining for days and continued to drizzle today, the deafening sound of firecrackers, the spirited songs, and the boiling cheers drowned everything out. At four o'clock in the afternoon, streams of people formed countless neat rows, braving the rain and treading muddy roads, converging on Revolutionary Park Square. Forty bright national flags fluttered around the venue, along with countless large and small flags forming a forest of banners, and countless umbrellas formed a canopy. A powerful contingent of 200,000 people, including workers, suburban farmers, revolutionary soldiers, tank crews, artillery units, students, and government personnel, stood heroically under the cover of these umbrellas, fervently singing the national anthem and shouting: Support the Central People's Government! Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Sino-Soviet friendship! Support world peace, oppose wars of aggression! They were so confident and powerful. People joyfully talked about how, in the past four months and ten days alone, the First Field Army of the People's Liberation Army, supported by the people of the Northwest, had liberated Xi'an, Lanzhou, Xining, Yinchuan, and Xinjiang. The complete liberation of the Great Northwest means that the infinitely rich resources will be developed to build a strong national industry, and that the Han, Hui, Mongolian, Tibetan, Uyghur, and other ethnic groups of the Northwest will unite in the great family of the Chinese nation's friendship and cooperation; it also means that the long border of the motherland will be forever adjacent to the Soviet Union, and that the friendship between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union will develop without limit.

　　At half past four in the afternoon, forty-eight gun salutes thundered to the sky. The meeting began with the national anthem, and the national flag slowly rose with the singing. Xi Zhongxun, Secretary of the Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Liu Jingfan, Acting Chairman of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government, Jia Tuofu, Mayor of Xi'an, and others spoke. After the meeting, 200,000 people immediately paraded with torches as a demonstration. The fire dragon rushed from the sea of people to the main streets, and immediately gongs and drums resounded, and songs and slogans echoed through the clouds.

　　At half past six in the afternoon, Yangko teams, music teams, and propaganda trucks from various units set out one after another. All the shops were decorated with lanterns and colored streamers. The atmosphere was completely new. When the Liberation Army soldiers launched the bright red signal flares into the sky, thousands of people cheered and applauded, and thousands of torches and lanterns illuminated the entire city of Xi'an, symbolizing the great and bright future of the construction of the new Xi'an, the new Northwest, and the new China.

　　狂欢的西安城
    本报特约通讯员  鸣天
    胜利的呼声，拥护毛主席的呼声，坚决保卫和平的呼声，响遍整个西北高原，响遍西北政治经济文化中心的西安城。十月二日——全世界进步人类共同庆贺和战斗的日子，西安市六十万人民投入无比的狂欢与坚毅的行动中。他们庆贺伟大祖国从此进入自由幸福的历史新纪元，他们仇恨帝国主义战争贩子，决心用行动表示自己保卫和平不可动摇的坚强意志。四十里方形的西安古城，这一天被星光灿烂的无数鲜红锦旗，被高大堂皇的无数彩色牌楼，装饰得美丽而庄严。虽然连日霪雨今天依然沥沥的下个不停，但是震空的爆竹声、昂扬的歌声、沸腾的欢呼声，把一切都淹没了。下午四时，人流结成无数整齐的行列，冒着大雨，踏着泥泞的道路，汇集到革命公园广场。会场四周招展着四十面鲜明的国旗，还有无数的大小旌旗形成旗林，无数把雨伞连成盖篷，包括工人、近郊农民、革命军人、坦克车、炮兵队、学生、机关人员共达二十万人的强大队列，就在这雨伞的覆盖下面，英武地立着，狂热地唱着国歌，高呼着：拥护中央人民政府！毛主席万岁！中苏友谊万岁！拥护世界和平，反对侵略战争！他们是如此的自信和有力量。人们欢欣地谈论着：在过去仅仅四个月另十一天中，由西北人民所支持的人民解放军第一野战军，已经解放了西安、兰州、西宁、银川和新疆。大西北的全部解放，意味着无限蕴藏的资源将被开发来建设祖国的强大工业，意味着西北汉、回、蒙、藏、维等各族同胞，将团结于中华民族友爱合作的大家庭；更意味着漫长的祖国边疆与苏联永远接壤，而无限量地发展中苏两大民族的友谊。
    下午四时半，震天响起四十八发礼炮。大会在国歌声中开始，国旗随歌声徐徐上升。中共中央西北局习仲勋书记、陕甘宁边区政府代主席刘景范、西安市市长贾拓夫等都讲了话。会毕，二十万人即高举火把游行示威。火龙从人海中奔向各主要街道，顿时锣鼓喧天，歌声、口号声响彻云霄。
    下午六时半，各单位的秧歌队、音乐队、宣传卡车纷纷出动。各商店门口都悬灯结彩。气象一新。当解放军战士把红光灿烂的信号弹放射上空时，千万群众欢呼鼓掌，千万个火炬灯笼映红了全西安城，象征着新西安，新西北，新中国的建设的远大光明前途。
