    [Chahar Urgent Telegram, 24th, 22:00] The plague that occurred in the Chahar League of Inner Mongolia continues to spread to northern Chahar. According to a telegram from the Chahar North Commissioner's Office on the 23rd, two adults and one child in Mantouying Village, 25 miles north of Zhangbei County (only 115 miles from Zhangjiakou City), died on the 23rd from vomiting and diarrhea, with symptoms resembling plague (personnel have been sent to investigate). At 10:00 a.m. on the 24th, the relevant departments of the Party, government, and military of Chahar Province urgently convened a meeting to discuss epidemic prevention measures. Yang Gengtian, Secretary of the Chahar Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Zhang Su, Chairman of the Provincial Government, and Wang Ping, Commander of the Military Region, personally participated. The meeting unanimously agreed that the plague is the current ferocious enemy of the people of Chahar Province, and epidemic prevention and eradication are urgent combat missions. In completing this task, the Party, government, military, and the broad masses should be urgently mobilized to actively participate, medical personnel should be mobilized to work in the epidemic area, and necessary administrative personnel should be assigned to cooperate, and the above personnel should be given medicines and epidemic prevention injections as soon as possible. The meeting particularly emphasized opposing panic and retreat. The specific measures for epidemic prevention are: 1. Establish two lines of defense, one from Duolun in the east to Huade in the west (along the boundary line between Inner Mongolia and the Chahar North Special Zone) and the other along the Outer Great Wall. The area between the two lines of defense is an isolation zone where passage is strictly prohibited. People who need to enter and exit must be examined and obtain special passes. 2. Cars, carts, cattle, and sheep traveling between Zhangjiakou and various parts of northern Chahar should be immediately stopped and prohibited. 3. Surround and blockade the epidemic area, epidemic villages, and epidemic households, and administer injections to surrounding villages. 4. Mobilize the masses in the isolation zone to implement joint prevention and reporting between villages and households to ensure no contact with outsiders, no accommodation, and carry out rat-killing campaigns. 5. The doors and windows of epidemic households must be blocked, and neighbors must move away. Patients should be given medical treatment, and the corpses, utensils, and clothing of the dead must be resolutely burned. Educate the masses to follow science and not accommodate backward customs. 6. Governments and Party committees at all levels should promptly, timely, and continuously report on the situation of the epidemic and its prevention and eradication. 7. Launch a rat and flea extermination campaign in Zhangjiakou to eliminate the vector for plague transmission. The Chahar Provincial Epidemic Prevention and Eradication Committee was established at the meeting, with Chairman Zhang Su serving as the director, Ouyang Jing, Minister of the Military Region Health Department, and Jiang Tao, Director of the Provincial Health Bureau, serving as deputy directors. Strong cadres from the Provincial Public Security Department and the Military Region Political Department were also sent to participate. It was also decided that the Chahar North Special Zone and its subordinate counties should establish command posts to unify leadership. The meeting decided to immediately telegraph the Chahar North Prefectural Committee and Commissioner's Office of the Chinese Communist Party to implement the resolution. Chairman Zhang Su of the Provincial Government will personally go to arrange the work, and the Provincial Government will send a plenipotentiary representative for epidemic prevention to be stationed in northern Chahar to be responsible for leading the completion of this arduous combat mission. Furthermore, the Chahar North Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened an emergency meeting of more than 200 cadres from the directly subordinate agencies of the special zone and the Zhangbei County government on the 24th to urgently mobilize everyone to participate in the fight to eliminate the plague.
    [Another Dispatch] The Northeast Plague Prevention Team, to help Chahar North eliminate the plague, departed from Shenyang to Beijing for work in Chahar at 8:00 p.m. on the 24th. The Plague Quarantine Group of the North China People's Government Health Department also accompanied them.
