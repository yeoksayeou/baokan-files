　　"Truly Worthy of Being Called a Friend!"
    Lao Han
    Yesterday, I went outside Yongdingmen for some business. While walking along the road, almost to the bridge north of Dahongmen, I saw two soldiers there exercising their horses. They looked like caretakers. The younger one, around twenty years old, was singing while leading the horse. Occasionally, he would tighten the reins and turn around, wanting to mount the horse. Unexpectedly, as he jumped up, the horse suddenly got startled. Because the road was slippery, it lost its footing and fell to the ground with the soldier. Seeing that the horse was about to run away and the man couldn't get up, I and another comrade on a bicycle quickly leaned our bikes against the willow trees by the roadside and ran over to help the young soldier up, letting him try to walk. Five or six farmers carrying night soil nearby also rushed over to help, stopping the horse.
    "Bee...Bee..."
    Just then, a black sedan drove from the end of the road, quickly arriving in front of us. The car stopped, and a tall man with a large nose and blue eyes, wearing a blue woolen coat, stepped out. He looked over the person being helped, and seeing that he couldn't put weight on one foot, he hurried to open the car door, beckoning everyone to help him into the car, meaning to take him to the hospital. No one could understand his words, but from his deep and sincere expression, everyone felt an unusually warm and kind feeling. The young soldier was embarrassed to get in the car, but eventually, everyone helped him into the car, and he quietly leaned back on the sofa in the car. The car owner closed the car door, then went to the front door to sit with the driver, leaning over to feel the soldier's injury and talking to him in words he couldn't understand.
    "Bee...Bee..." With a few beeps, the car started.
    The several farmers carrying night soil were all surprised by this scene. A short, middle-aged man asked, "Does this foreigner in the car know him?"
    "No, this is our Soviet friend, he is like this to every working person," explained a person in a worker's uniform on a bicycle.
    "Ah! No wonder, this is a Soviet friend!" A middle-aged farmer paused slightly, and then slowly continued: "It was about this time last year, or maybe a little later. One evening, it was getting dark and the wind was blowing. A jeep with American soldiers in it was driving faster than an arrow, and it crushed an old woman collecting firewood, splattering her brains out. But by the time people arrived, the jeep was long gone."
    "The American imperialists have always been like this!" I interjected.
    An old farmer with a snow-white beard standing next to me watched the car disappearing at the end of the road and nodded meaningfully: "Ah! Truly worthy of being called a friend!"

　　“真够得起朋友啊”
    牢寒
    昨天因事到永定门外去，沿着马路快到大红门北面桥上的时候，见有两个战士在那里溜马，看样子象是饲养员。后面的那个二十岁上下的青年。一边拉着马走，一边唱着歌，他偶而勒住缰绳，回过头来想骑上马去，不料他向上一纵，那马突然一惊，因为马路光滑，失了前蹄，连人带马，一齐摔在地上，看看马要跑掉了，人也摔得爬不起来。我和另一位骑车子的同志见了，忙把车子靠在路旁的柳树上，跑过去把那个青年战士扶起来，让他试着走一走。附近五六个担粪的农民也赶来营救，并帮他把马截住。
    “比……比……”
    正在这时，马路尽头驶来一辆黑色的小卧车，很快到了跟前，车子停下了，车门开处，走出来一位穿着蓝呢子衣服，身材高大，大鼻子蓝眼睛的人，他把那位被搀着的人打量了一下，见他一只脚踏不得地，忙过去拉开车门，招呼大家扶他上车，意思是把他送到医院去。人们谁都听不懂他的话，但从他那深厚诚挚的表情看来，每个人都会深深的感到异样的温暖可亲。青年战士不好意思上车，但后来终于被大家扶上了汽车，安静的靠在车厢里的沙发上。车主人关上车门，再从前面车门进去和司机并坐在一起，一面探过身来摸他的伤处，和他讲着不懂的话。
    “比……比……”几声，汽车开动了。
    几个担粪的农民，对这个场面，都感到莫明的惊讶。一个矮个的中年人就问：“这位坐车的外国人认识他吗？”
    “不，这就是咱们的苏联朋友，他对每个劳动人民都是这样的。”一位骑车子穿着工作人员服装的人解释着。
    “啊！怪不得哩，这就是苏联朋友！”一位中年农民略顿了一下，慢慢的又说下去：“去年差不多也是这时候，或许稍迟一点。一天傍黑，刮着风，一辆坐着美国兵的吉普车，开得比箭还快，把一个拾柴火的老太太的脑浆都轧出来了，可是等人们赶到，吉普车早已不知去向了。”
    “美国帝国主义者从来就是这样的！”我这样插了一句。
    立在我旁边的一个长着雪白胡子的老农民望着快要消失在马路尽头的那辆汽车，意味深长的点了点头：“啊！真够得起朋友啊！”
