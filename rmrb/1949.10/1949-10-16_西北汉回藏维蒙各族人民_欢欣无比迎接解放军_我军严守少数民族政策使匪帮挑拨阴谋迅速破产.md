Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 14th: The people of Han, Hui, Uyghur, Tibetan, and Mongolian nationalities in Northwest China warmly support their liberators—the People's Liberation Army. With the help of the People's Liberation Army, they have broken free from the shackles of the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang and the Two Ma warlords and are now celebrating their liberation with boundless joy.

When the People's Liberation Army advanced into Gansu from Shaanxi in three routes this summer, the areas passed by each route, such as Pingliang, Guyuan, and Haiyuan in the northern route; Qingshui, Huaping, Jingning, and Gaolan in the central route; and Ningding, Hezheng, Kangle, Linxia, and Yongjing in the southern route, were all areas with concentrated Hui populations. Wherever the People's Liberation Army arrived, the local Hui people warmly welcomed and diligently treated them, busying themselves with clearing houses, boiling water, and helping with cooking. Some even helped the People's Liberation Army lead the way and cross rivers. When the People's Liberation Army on the southern route advanced along a road hundreds of miles long from Lintao to Linxia, the Hui and Han people of each village and town along the way stood at the village entrances, holding baskets of pears and pancakes that had been prepared a few days earlier, to welcome the People's Liberation Army. In Linxia, where the Hui people account for more than 85 percent of the local population, colorful welcome slogans had already been posted on the trees along the road fifteen miles west of the city before the People's Liberation Army arrived. More than ten thousand Hui and Han people crowded the roadside, enthusiastically applauding to welcome them. When the vanguard of the People's Liberation Army crossed the Yellow River one mile northwest of Xunhua County, on the border of Long and Qing, to advance towards Xining, a large wooden boat carrying one hundred and sixty soldiers suddenly had two oars broken by the rapid currents and waves. The wooden boat immediately drifted downstream like a kite with a broken string, with a high risk of being smashed by reefs or overturned by waterfalls. At this extremely critical moment, the Hui people from more than twenty households in Qingshui Village on the riverbank saw this and rushed to rescue them, men and women, old and young. Several men bravely jumped into the water to pull the tow rope on the boat, and several women followed suit, working together to finally pull the wooden boat closer to the shore, rescuing all the soldiers on board. When the People's Liberation Army presented the Hui people of the village with two red satin banners inscribed with "Heroic Boat Rescue, Glory to the Entire Village" and "Heroes Save Heroes" to express sincere gratitude, the village's Ahong (imam) Han Youfu replied, "You drove away the Ma warlords and saved us Hui people, so of course we should rescue you."

The Tibetan people in the areas awaiting liberation also fully demonstrated their eagerness for liberation. Not long after the liberation of Linxia in Gansu and Xining in Qinghai, Tibetan people or Lama temples from nearby areas awaiting liberation, such as Xiahe, Zhuoni, Datong, Huzhu, Huangzhong, Guide, Hualong, and Tongren, successively sent representatives (including four female representatives) to welcome the People's Liberation Army and urge the People's Liberation Army to advance rapidly. Muwu Banner south of Xiahe was the first to send a delegation of seven people, representing the 80,000 Tibetan people of the banner, carrying a proclamation from the First Route Headquarters of the Chinese People's Soviet Republic Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army, which had been treasured for fourteen years, and traveled two hundred miles to Linxia to welcome the People's Liberation Army to liberate the area. During their stay with the People's Liberation Army, the delegation translated the Eight Articles of Agreement promulgated by the People's Liberation Army Headquarters into Tibetan in one day and night, and reproduced and brought it back. Tibetan people from Yushu, Chengduo, and Xiangqian counties in southern Qinghai, which were awaiting liberation, sent 237 representatives, carrying thousands of fine horses and local specialties such as furs and musk, crossed the headwaters of the Yellow River and the Yangtze River, the Jinsha River and the Machu River, and traveled a difficult journey of about 1,800 miles over the Zhasuo Lan Mountain to express their appreciation to the People's Liberation Army. Xi Rao, a young Tibetan from the Sichuan-Kangbian area, entrusted by more than 20,000 Tibetan people, came to Lanzhou via the snowy mountains and grasslands that the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army had passed through during its eastward march to resist Japan. He told of the people's longing for Chairman Mao, their longing for the Red Army, and their eagerness to return to the big family of unity and friendship among all nationalities. Uyghur compatriots residing in Lanzhou City, Xinjiang, also represented the more than three million Uyghur people of Xinjiang and requested General Peng Dehuai, commander of the First Field Army of the People's Liberation Army, to quickly station the People's Liberation Army in Xinjiang. After the liberation of Yinchuan City, the capital of Ningxia Province, the Mongolian people of Alashan Banner also sent representatives to Yinchuan City, traveling for days in the rain to welcome the People's Liberation Army to quickly liberate the oppressed Mongolian people of the banner. In recent decades, the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries and the Two Ma warlords in the Northwest has created estrangement, hatred, massacres, and poverty in the lives of people of all nationalities. When the People's Liberation Army marched into Gansu to carry out the great historical task of liberating the Great Northwest, the Ma warlords even spread rumors and slanders among the Hui people, saying that the People's Liberation Army wanted to "kill the Hui and destroy the religion," and put forward the bloody slogan of "destroying production to protect property, risking lives to protect life," in an attempt to drive the Hui people to be enemies of the People's Liberation Army. However, because all the commanders and fighters of the First Field Army of the People's Liberation Army resolutely implemented the Chinese Communist Party's policy on minority nationalities and strictly observed the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention of the People's Liberation Army, the doubts and fears of the people of all nationalities, especially the Hui people, about the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army quickly disappeared, and the Ma warlords' conspiracies and tricks quickly went bankrupt. In mid-July, when the Political Department of the First Field Army issued the mobilization order to advance into Gansu, it called on the entire army to resolutely implement the policy of national equality and the policy of giving preferential treatment to Hui prisoners of the Two Ma armies. It successively printed and distributed "Rules for Hui Work" and "Points for Attention When Entering Hui Areas." Ideological education was widely carried out in the troops, supplemented by lectures, and policy studies were conducted. Some units also invited Hui soldiers to serve as Hui work cadres in the Revolutionary Military Committee, leading Hui work, or organizing Hui groups to carry out various tasks among the Hui masses. After entering minority areas, they widely publicized the Chinese Communist Party's policy on minority nationalities and, in actual practice, did not casually enter mosques or Lama temples, and did not smoke cigarettes in front of Hui and Tibetan Living Buddhas.

    Achievements in Implementing the CCP's Ethnic Policy
    People of Han, Hui, Uyghur, Tibetan, and Mongolian Nationalities Eliminate Barriers and Strengthen Unity and Cooperation

The Chinese Communist Party's policy of national equality and national unity, which the People's Liberation Army resolutely implements, has achieved great success in educating and uniting the people of all nationalities. The Ma warlords have always created contradictions between nationalities to benefit their rule. They often provoked relations between the Salar and Tibetan people in Xunhua County, Qinghai. After the People's Liberation Army arrived, the Tibetan people generally harbored animosity towards the Salar people due to the Salar people's killings of Tibetan people. After the People's Liberation Army exposed the Ma warlords' criminal conspiracies to sow discord and widely publicized that the People's Liberation Army was an army of the people of all nationalities throughout the country, the estrangement between the two peoples was quickly eliminated, and the unity of the two peoples was strengthened. The Salar people gratefully said: "In the past, whenever a Han army came, the Tibetans would definitely kill the Salar people once, but this time the People's Liberation Army came, and the Tibetans did not kill the Salar people." Similarly, the estrangement and hatred that existed between the Han and Hui peoples have also gradually been eliminated under the education of the Chinese Communist Party's policy on minority nationalities. At present, the people of all nationalities are becoming increasingly aware and organized. The preparatory committee of the mass organization for uniting Hui youth—the All-China Hui Democratic Youth Federation and the preparatory committee of the Lanzhou branch—were established in Lanzhou City on September 21. The preparatory committee of the New Democratic Youth League in Xiahe County, one of the central areas of the Tibetan people on the border of Sichuan, Kang, Long, and Qing, has been established, and 44 Tibetan youths (including three young women) have been approved for admission as members of the Youth League. The preparatory meeting for the representative conference of various tribes in eastern Tibet, including all of Qinghai and Xikang, southwestern Gansu, the Qilian Mountains of the Hexi Corridor, and northwestern Sichuan, has been held in Xiahe. The people of all nationalities are united in striving for the complete liberation of the Hui, Uyghur, Tibetan, Mongolian, and other nationalities, and for the construction of a big family of friendship and cooperation among all nationalities—the People's Republic of China.

　　西北汉回藏维蒙各族人民
  　欢欣无比迎接解放军
    我军严守少数民族政策使匪帮挑拨阴谋迅速破产
    汉回族人民腾房烧水
  　殷勤招待帮助解放军
    【新华社兰州十四日电】西北区汉、回、维（吾尔）、藏、蒙各族人民热烈拥护自己的解放者——人民解放军。他们在人民解放军帮助之下，摆脱了国民党及二马匪军的反动统治的枷锁之后，正以欢欣无比地庆祝自己的解放。
    当人民解放军于今年夏天自陕西分三路向甘肃进军时，各路大军所经过的地方，如北路的平凉、固源、海原，中路的清水、化平、静宁、皋兰，南路的宁定、和政、康乐、临夏、永靖等县都是回族人民集中的地区，解放军每到一个地方，当地回族人民无不热烈欢迎，殷勤招待，忙着腾房子，烧开水，帮助作饭。有些并帮助解放军带路、渡河。当南路人民解放军沿数百里长的道路从临洮向临夏挺进时，沿途各村镇回汉人民提着一筐一筐的梨子，拿着几天前就做好了的烙饼，站在村口路旁欢迎解放军。回民占当地人口百分之八十五以上的临夏，在解放军到达前，城西十五里的路旁树上早已贴满了各色欢迎标语。万余回汉人民拥挤道旁热烈鼓掌欢迎。解放军先头部队在陇青边境循化县城西北一里许渡黄河向西宁挺进时，有一只坐着一百六十名战士的大木船，有两张木桨突然被急流激浪打断，木船顿时便象脱线的风筝一样顺水而下，很有被暗礁撞破或被瀑布打翻的可能。在这万分紧急的时候，河岸边清水村二十多户的回民看见后，男女老少便蜂拥前来抢救，有几个男子首先很勇敢地跳下水去拉船上的牵绳，几个女人也接着跳下水去，齐心协力终于把木船拉近岸边，救出了全船战士。当人民解放军以“奋勇救船，全村光荣”和“英雄救英雄”两面红缎锦旗赠送该村回族人民表示衷心感激时，该村阿訇韩有福答谢说：“你们打走了马匪军、救了我们回民，我们当然应该搭救你们。”
    待解放区藏维蒙各族人民
    从数百里外往迎解放军
    待解放区的藏族人民，也充分表现了他们渴望解放的焦急心情。还在甘肃临夏、青海西宁解放后不久，附近待解放的夏河、卓尼、大通、互助、湟中、贵德、化隆、同仁等地藏族人民或喇嘛寺院均先后派代表（其中有四名妇女代表）前来欢迎解放军。催促解放军迅速前进。夏河以南陌务旗曾首先派出代表团七人，代表该旗八万藏民携带珍存十四年的中华人民苏维埃共和国抗日救国军第一路司令部的布告，从二百里外赶至临夏欢迎解放军前往解放该地。代表团留住解放军期间，曾以一昼夜时间将人民解放军总部公布的约法八章译成藏文，并翻印携回。青海南部待解放的玉树、称多、襄谦三县藏民派了二百卅七名代表携带骏马千匹及该区皮毛、麝香等特产，涉过黄河、长江发源地金沙江和玛楚河，翻越札索兰山约一千八百里艰苦行程慰劳解放军。川康边的藏民青年希饶受二万多藏民的委托，取道中国工农红军东进抗日时经过的雪山草地来到兰州，他诉说了那里的人民怀念毛主席、怀念红军和渴望回到各族人民团结友爱的大家庭中来的殷切心情。新疆旅居兰州市的维吾尔族同胞，也代表新疆三百多万的维吾尔人民向第一野战军司令员彭德怀将军要求人民解放军迅速进驻新疆。宁夏省会银川市解放后，阿拉善旗蒙民也派出代表历西日行程冒雨至银川市欢迎解放军迅速前往解放该旗被压迫的蒙族人民。近几十年来国民党反动派及两马匪帮在西北的反动统治造成了各民族间的隔膜、仇视、惨杀和各族人民生活的贫困。人民解放军向甘肃进军执行解放大西北的伟大历史任务时，马匪更在回族人民中大肆造谣和污蔑，说什么解放军要“杀回灭教”，并提出所谓：“破产保产，拼命保命”的血腥口号，企图驱使回族人民与人民解放军为敌。但由于人民解放军第一野战军全体指战员坚决执行了中国共产党的少数民族政策和严格遵守人民解放军的三大纪律八项注意，使各族人民特别是回族人民对共产党、解放军的疑惧很快就告消失，马匪的阴谋诡计也很快就宣告破产。七月中间，第一野战军政治部在颁发进军甘肃的动员令时，即号召全军坚决执行民族平等政策与坚决执行优待二马军回民俘虏政策先后印发“回民工作守则”，进入回民区应注意事项等。在部队中广泛展开思想教育，配合讲课，进行政策学习。有的单位并请回民战士担任革命军人委员会的回民工作干事，领导回民工作，或组织回民小组在回民群众中进行各种工作。在进入少数民族区域后广泛宣传中国共产党的少数民族政策，并且在实际行动中不随便进清真寺、喇嘛寺，不在回民和藏民活佛座前吸纸烟。
    执行中共民族政策的成就
  　汉、回、维、藏、蒙族人民消除隔阂加强了团结合作
    人民解放军所坚决执行的中国共产党的民族平等和民族团结的政策，在教育和团结各民族人民方面已经获得了很大的成就。马匪向来制造各民族之间的矛盾以利于他们的统治。他们在青海循化县曾经常挑拨萨拉族和藏民之间的关系。利用萨拉人仇杀藏民人民解放军到达后，藏民还普遍地存在着对萨拉人的仇视情绪。经解放军揭露马匪挑拨离间的阴谋罪恶，并广泛宣传解放军是全国各族人民的军队后，很快地便消除了两族人民间的隔阂，加强了两族人民的团结。萨拉族人民都感激地说：“过去凡汉人军队来一次，藏民必定杀萨拉人一次，这次解放军来，藏民就没有杀萨拉人。”同样存在于汉回两族人民间之隔阂与仇恨在中国共产党少数民族政策的教育之下亦已逐渐消除。目前各民族人民正在日益觉醒起来和组织起来。团结回民青年的群众组织——中华回族民主青年会筹备会及兰州分会筹备会已于九月二十一日在兰州市成立。川、康、陇、青边界藏民中心区之一的夏河县的新民主主义青年团筹备会已经成立，并且已经有四十四名（内有三名女青年）藏民青年被批准吸收为青年团员。包括青海、西康全部，甘肃西南部，河西走廊祁连山区及四川西北部的东藏各部落的代表会议筹备会已经在夏河召开。各民族人民团结为全部解放回、维、藏、蒙等各族人民，建设各族人民友爱合作的大家庭——中华人民共和国而努力。
