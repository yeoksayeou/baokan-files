Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 2nd — Comprehensive TASS news: The general debate of the United Nations General Assembly, which began on September 21, concluded on the 26th. Starting on the 27th, the various committees of the United Nations General Assembly have begun their work one after another.

The most important committee of the United Nations General Assembly—the First Committee (Political and Security Committee)—began its work on the 27th. The committee elected the vice-chairman (Turkish representative Sabur) and the rapporteur (Panamanian representative Taqi), and adopted the committee's rules of procedure. During the discussion of whether the Soviet proposal on condemning preparations for a new war and concluding a five-power peace pact should be placed at the top of the First Committee's agenda, the Kuomintang and British representatives attempted to place the Soviet proposal at the end of the agenda, and the Peruvian representative even attempted to exclude the Soviet proposal from the agenda altogether. The head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, refuted the above statements, emphasized the importance of the Soviet proposal, and demanded that the issue be considered as quickly as possible. Therefore, Vyshinsky suggested that the Soviet proposal should be included among the first few items to be discussed on the agenda. The Lebanese representative then specifically proposed placing the Soviet proposal third on the First Committee's agenda. This proposal was adopted by a majority of forty votes to twelve, with five abstentions. The entire order of discussion of the various issues on the proposed agenda was adopted by a majority of fifty-two votes to one, with three abstentions. Thus, the First Committee has determined the following order of discussion: the report of the United Nations "Balkan Committee" (i.e., the so-called "Greek Question"), the question of the fate of the former Italian colonies, the Soviet proposal on condemning preparations for a new war and concluding a five-power peace pact, the Palestine question, the Indonesian question, and the report of the Security Council.

　　联大第一委员会决定
  　苏和平公约建议列在议程第三位
    【新华社北京二日电】综合塔斯社消息：自九月二十一日开始的联合国大会的一般发言，至二十六日止已告结束。自二十七日起，联合国大会各委员会已逐一开始工作。
    联合国大会最重要的委员会——第一委员会（政治及安全委员会）于二十七日开始工作。该委员会选出了副主席（土耳其代表沙勃尔）及报告人（巴拿马代表台奇），并通过了委员会的议事程序。在讨论苏联所提关于谴责新战争准备并缔结五强和平公约的建议是否应排入第一委员会议程的前列时，国民党和英国的代表试图把苏联的建议放在议程的末尾，秘鲁的代表甚至试图将苏联的建议不列入议程上。苏联代表团团长维辛斯基驳斥上述发言，并强调指出苏联建议的重要性，要求问题获得最迅速的考虑。因之，维辛斯基建议，苏联的建议应列入议程的首先讨论的几个项目之内。黎巴嫩代表又具体提议将苏联的建议列在第一委员会议程的第三位，这一提议在付表决时，以四十票对十二票的多数通过，五票弃权。拟议中的议程上的各项问题的整个讨论次序，以五十二票对一票的多数获得通过，三票弃权。这样，第一委员会已确定下列讨论次序：联合国“巴尔干委员会”的报告（即所谓“希腊问题”），前意大利殖民地命运问题，苏联关于谴责新战争准备并缔结五强和平公约的建议，巴勒斯坦问题，印尼问题以及安理会的报告。
