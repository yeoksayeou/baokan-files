　　Completely Eliminate Loopholes for Espionage Groups
    Following the Soviet government's note to the Yugoslav government on September 28, announcing the abolition of the Soviet-Yugoslav Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance and Post-War Cooperation concluded in April 1945, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and other People's Democratic countries have successively announced the abolition of friendship treaties with Yugoslavia. This unanimous action is extremely natural and is entirely necessary and reasonable to safeguard the security of the world peace camp, to maintain the friendship between the Soviet Union, the People's Democratic countries and the Yugoslav people, and to maintain the dignity of the peaceful foreign policy of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, because these treaties have, in fact, been thoroughly trampled upon and torn up by the Tito gang, an espionage group.

    Since the Cominform exposed the Tito group's betrayal of the principles of proletarian internationalism and the democratic peace camp in June of last year, the Tito group's despicable activities of hostility towards the Soviet Union and the Eastern European People's Democratic countries have become increasingly frequent and obvious over the past year. These despicable and shameless activities are carried out in accordance with the will of its masters, the American and British imperialists. Initially, the Tito group secretly carried out despicable acts of betrayal, while pretending to have no contact with American and British imperialism, and pretending to be very "friendly" with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. The reason why the Tito group adopted this counter-revolutionary double-dealing tactic was because it feared the opposition of the Yugoslav people and the people of the world, and used this counter-revolutionary double-dealing tactic to conceal and deceive the Yugoslav people and the people of the world. However, as time went on, this fox tail of hostility towards the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries could no longer be concealed. Immediately after the Soviet government exposed the Tito group's abuse and illegal arrest of Soviet expatriates, and exposed the Yugoslav government's betrayal of the interests of the Galician Slovene people on the Austrian peace treaty issue, the trial of traitors and spies in Budapest, Hungary, which ended on September 24, nakedly exposed the ugly face of the Tito group's betrayal of socialism and the People's Democratic revolution, shamefully degenerating into an imperialist espionage agency and tool of aggression hostile to the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries.

    The trial of the Budapest treason case proved that the Tito group carried out hostile subversive activities against the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, and began these hostile and subversive activities during the anti-Hitler war in accordance with the instructions of the American and British imperialist groups. The Budapest indictment proved that the Tito group bandits were recruited by American and British imperialists to engage in espionage activities long ago, and they were particularly encouraged by Churchill. Hungarian traitor Balfy stated in his confession that he had sent Nimis to Moscow in 1948 to serve as a military attaché, so that he could carry out espionage activities in the Soviet Union. Nimis maintained contact with the Tito group's intelligence agency in Moscow; after the Cominform resolution was published, he also directly contacted the Yugoslav ambassador to Moscow, Mrazovic. Tito group spy Brankov confessed that between 1946 and 1947, Tito sent so-called "representatives of the Yugoslav Communist Party" Brankov, Novorsie, Kovacevic and Ratic to various People's Democratic countries to carry out espionage and subversive activities. The Tito gang's plan was to instigate the people of Yugoslavia and the People's Democratic countries to oppose the Soviet Union, to win over all reactionary and anti-people elements in the People's Democratic countries, and to organize armed riots in order to achieve their despicable goal of remaining as lackeys of imperialism.

    This extremely sinful plan fully proves that the Tito group has completely subordinated itself to the imperialist group and become a shameful tool of the American and British imperialist aggression policy. "This fact must lead and has in fact led to the abolition of the sovereignty and independence of the Republic of Yugoslavia." Maintaining a "mutual assistance and friendship" treaty with a country ruled by such an espionage group has completely lost its meaning. The trial of the Hungarian treason case proved the Tito group's despicable purpose in originally concluding the friendship treaty, which was only to facilitate their espionage and subversive activities against the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, and to conceal their extremely ugly face of acting as a running dog of imperialism. It goes without saying that the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries' announcement of the abolition of the friendship treaties concluded with Yugoslavia will eliminate the loopholes for the Tito group's espionage and sabotage activities, and expelling the Tito group's spies will make the democratic peace camp stronger and more consolidated, and will further increase the close unity and brotherly friendship between the people of the People's Democratic countries.

    Of course, the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries are friendly to the Yugoslav people, but there is no "friendship" to be said for the executioners and oppressors who harm the Yugoslav people and the Tito group that betrays the interests of the Yugoslav people. The Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries' announcement of the abolition of the friendship treaties with Yugoslavia is precisely a manifestation of the Soviet government and the People's Democratic countries' sincere friendship to the Yugoslav people. This sincere friendship is completely consistent with the Yugoslav people's struggle against the Tito group's brutal rule. At present, the Yugoslav people are suffering serious hardships under the Tito group, and the most outstanding sons and daughters of the Yugoslav people are heroically resisting the Tito group's fascist rule, and are reviving the revolutionary Yugoslav Communist Party which is loyal to the principles of internationalism. The Tito group's bloody terror at home, and its espionage activities in serving the American and British imperialist groups, cannot save it from its inevitable demise.

### 彻底杜绝间谍集团可乘之隙

　　彻底杜绝间谍集团可乘之隙
    苏联政府九月二十八日照会南斯拉夫政府，宣布废除一九四五年四月缔结的苏南友好互助条约之后，接着波、匈、罗、保等人民民主国家，亦先后宣布废除与南国的友好条约。这种一致行动是极自然的，这对于维护世界和平阵营的安全，维护苏联、各人民民主国家与南斯拉夫人民间的友谊，维护苏联、各人民民主国家的和平外交政策的尊严，是完全必要与合理的，因为这些条约，实际上已被铁托匪帮，间谍集团彻底践踏与撕毁了。
    从去年六月共产党情报局揭发铁托集团背叛工人阶级国际主义原则和民主和平阵营以后，一年多来，铁托集团仇视苏联及东欧各人民民主国家的卑劣活动，日益频繁与明显。而这些卑劣无耻的活动，是遵从其主子美英帝国主义的意旨行事的。最初，铁托集团一面暗地里做着卑劣的背叛活动，一面还装做与美英帝国主义没有联系的样子，装作与苏联和人民民主国家还很“友好”的样子。铁托集团之所以采取这种反革命的两面派手法，是因为惧怕南斯拉夫人民和世界人民反对它，用这种反革命的两面手法掩饰和欺骗南斯拉夫人民与世界人民。但是，日子长了，这种对苏联和人民民主国家敌视的狐狸尾巴，是再也无法掩盖了。紧接苏联政府揭露铁托集团虐待与非法逮捕苏联侨民，揭露南斯拉夫政府在对奥和约问题上出卖加林西亚斯洛文族人民利益之后，九月二十四日在匈京布达佩斯结束的对叛国犯及间谍分子的审判中，更赤裸裸地暴露了铁托集团背叛社会主义与人民民主革命的丑恶面目，可耻地堕落为敌视苏联与人民民主国家的帝国主义间谍机关和侵略工具。
    布达佩斯叛国案的审讯中，证明了铁托集团对苏联和各人民民主国家进行敌对的颠覆活动，并且按照美英帝国主义集团的训令，在反希特勒的战争期间，就开始了这种敌视和颠覆活动。布达佩斯的起诉书证明：铁托集团匪徒们，很早以前，就被美英帝国主义者召募去作间谍活动，他们特别得到邱吉尔的鼓励。匈叛国犯巴尔费在供词中称，他曾于一九四八年派遣尼米斯到莫斯科任武官，使其在苏联进行间谍活动。尼米斯在莫斯科保持与铁托集团谍报机关的联系；情报局决议发表后，又与南斯拉夫驻莫斯科大使姆拉佐维奇直接联系。铁托集团间谍分子布兰科夫供认在一九四六到一九四七年间，铁托派遣所谓“南斯拉夫共产党代表”布兰科夫、诺伏尔谢、柯瓦西维奇和拉提奇等，往各人民民主国家进行间谍与颠覆性活动。铁托奸细集团的计划，是挑拨南斯拉夫及各人民民主国家人民反对苏联，拉拢人民民主国家中一切反动的反人民分子，组织武装暴动，以达到其保持为帝国主义走狗的卑劣目的。
    这个罪大恶极的计划，充分证明铁托集团已完全附属于帝国主义集团，成为美英帝国主义侵略政策的可耻工具。“这一事实必定导向而且实际上已经导向取消南斯拉夫共和国的主权和独立”，对这样的间谍集团统治着的国家保持“互助友好”条约，已经完全失去意义。匈牙利叛国案的审讯，证明了铁托集团原来缔结友好条约的卑鄙目的，只是为了便利他们对苏联及各人民民主国家进行间谍与颠覆活动，用来掩盖其充当帝国主义走狗的极端丑恶的面目而已。不言而喻，苏联及各人民民主国家宣布废除与南斯拉夫缔结的友好条约，便杜绝了铁托集团间谍破坏活动可乘之隙，把铁托集团的间谍驱逐出境，将使民主和平阵营更加坚强与巩固，并使人民民主国家人民间亲密团结的兄弟友谊更加增长。
    当然，苏联及各人民民主国家对南斯拉夫人民是友好的，只是对残害南斯拉夫人民的刽子手和压迫者，出卖南斯拉夫人民利益的铁托集团才无“友好”可言。苏联及各人民民主国家宣布废除对南友好条约，正是苏联政府及各人民民主国家对南斯拉夫人民诚挚友谊的表现。这种诚挚的友谊，是与南斯拉夫人民反对铁托集团的残暴统治的斗争完全一致的。目前，南斯拉夫人民正遭受着铁托集团严重的苦难，南斯拉夫人民最优秀的儿女，正英勇地反抗铁托集团的法西斯统治，并正在使忠实于国际主义原则的革命的南国共产党复活。铁托集团的对内血腥恐怖，及其为美英帝国主义集团效劳的间谍活动，都挽救不了它的必然灭亡。
