　　How to Launch a Rationalization Proposal Campaign?
　　In the past three years, workers and staff in Lüda have achieved considerable success in launching rationalization proposal campaigns due to their increased class consciousness and learning from the advanced experience of Soviet industrial management. According to statistics, in 1948 alone, employees made 1,426 rationalization proposals for production. Especially during the "Support the Party" competition this year, the rationalization proposal campaign has been further promoted, thereby improving production efficiency, reducing costs, and completing or exceeding production plans on schedule.

　　However, this campaign is not yet widespread. In key Sino-Soviet joint ventures, the rationalization proposal campaign has been carried out more extensively and deeply due to more planned and organized leadership. Some state-owned enterprises have also achieved great results due to their emphasis on this work. However, many other enterprises and factories have not paid due attention to this campaign, or it only flares up during the model worker or merit campaign and then subsides. Therefore, when the Lüda Federation of Trade Unions proposes to launch rationalization proposals as the central task for the second half of the year, it is necessary to solve several ideological and organizational leadership issues.

　　1. Improve Production Levels Through Rationalization Proposals
　　The premise of launching a rationalization proposal campaign is the attention of the enterprise administration and trade union leaders; otherwise, rationalization proposals will remain empty talk. Rationalization proposals are a higher stage of development of the model worker and merit campaigns, because "shock" or high-intensity labor ultimately has time and physical limitations, while technological inventions or improvements in work methods are permanent. More importantly, once the experience of rationalization proposals is disseminated and exchanged, it is generally easier for most employees to accept, and even easier for technically unskilled workers to imitate, thereby improving the overall production level.

　　2. Correct One-Sided Views and Overly High Demands
　　For a long time, our understanding of rationalization proposals has been one-sided or narrow. In general, we have emphasized the enthusiasm of workers, but have not paid enough attention to the promotion of rationalization proposals, that is, the development of workers' creativity. In the past, our understanding of rationalization proposals focused on technical or machine tool inventions and reforms (of course, this is necessary and important), but failed to use our brains in all aspects that are beneficial to production. Even if there are some improvements, we feel that they are not worth mentioning. Workers are unwilling to tell others, and even if they do, the administration neither promotes nor expands them, nor calculates their value. The existence of this idea has led to many detours in our work, and has also buried the creativity of many excellent workers.

　　The rationalization reforms of various Soviet enterprises have given us great inspiration. For example, workers and engineers at the Molotov Automobile Factory made 10,000 rationalization proposals for production in four months, saving the factory 30 million rubles in one year. Another example is that Akobaf, Kashimov, and Geminski, lathe workers in Baku, suggested spending a few minutes after work to tidy up the lathe and prepare the work position so that the replacement shift can start working immediately, thus increasing output by 15 percent. From this, it can be seen that the scope of rationalization proposals is very broad, and the content is also very rich.

　　The scope of rationalization proposals is very wide, so factory managers and trade union comrades should inspire and guide employees to use their brains and think of more ways in many ways. Once a factory director talked about the issue of rationalization proposals, he said: "In the past, when workers made some suggestions for improvement in production, I always asked if it could increase efficiency by hundreds of percent. If it couldn't increase by a multiple or save a multiple of labor, then forget it." Why require such a high level? If the existing production efficiency is 100 percent, is it not good to increase it by 5 or 10 percent? It is always higher than the existing level.

　　3. Implement in an Organized and Planned Manner
　　The development of a rationalization proposal campaign requires not only advocacy and publicity, but more importantly, organization and planning. In order to carry out the rationalization proposal campaign in an organized and planned manner, it is necessary to establish a certain organization in the factory composed of engineers, technicians, and outstanding employees to specifically launch, plan, and promote rationalization proposals. For example, the experience of the railway factory's technical reward, the electro-chemical factory's rationalization proposal committee, and the China Electric Factory's "Recruit Merit" committee are all worth learning; otherwise, it is easy to form a spontaneous flow.

　　Secondly, the successful experience of production meetings implemented in various Soviet enterprise departments for 20 to 30 years is particularly worth learning and promoting. In various Soviet factories, mines, and other enterprise departments, production meetings organized by workers, engineers, technicians, administrative and trade union representatives are held regularly once or twice a month. At this meeting, production plans, suggestions for improving production organization and labor processes, conservation of raw materials, measures to increase labor productivity and reduce costs are discussed, and the experience of rationalization proposals is exchanged, and rationalization and invention proposals are discussed. Therefore, it has played a great role in socialist production and construction. Comrade Kuznetsov once said: "Production meetings are one of the most effective ways to promote the participation of the broad masses of working people directly in the mass production work of socialist construction." Our factories have many meetings, but lack regular meetings dedicated to studying and improving technology, increasing production, and discussing rationalization proposals. Some have irregular meetings, but have not well implemented and summarized the experience.

　　Rationalization proposal is a very delicate and scientific organizational work, and there should be a certain organization to lead and master it, and procedures and disciplines should also be established. For example, the proposer must report in advance, and can only start the experiment after obtaining the approval of the engineer or technical director. After three to six months of testing, it can be promoted throughout the factory only after it has been proven to be completely successful. Otherwise, it will disrupt the production order, and even lead to deviations that only focus on output and ignore quality, or only focus on the part and ignore the whole.

　　4. Have a Set of Reward Measures
　　Different rewards should be given according to the value generated by the invention or rationalization proposal and the amount of cost reduction, so that the political consciousness of the working masses can be combined with material incentives, and personal interests can be combined with social interests.

　　At present, a complete set of reward measures has been implemented and is being implemented in the Sino-Soviet enterprise departments, that is, according to the "Reward Regulations for Inventions and Technical Improvements and Rationalization Proposals for Production" promulgated by the Soviet People's Committee in 1942; while most state-owned enterprises do not have it, or lack scientific calculation even if they do. Therefore, we must learn and adopt the Soviet method.

　　5. Good Summary and Promotion of Experience
　　In order to smoothly carry out the rationalization proposal campaign, it is also necessary to well summarize and promote the experience of rationalization proposals. When rationalization proposals have formed a campaign, in addition to newspapers reporting in an organized and planned manner, the Federation of Trade Unions and major enterprises must also organize various symposiums to summarize and exchange the experience of rationalization proposals in order to expand and promote them.

　　Launching a rationalization proposal in an organized and planned way is a new task. We are willing to learn from the Soviet Union together, learn in practical work, create and accumulate experience, and improve the level of production. (Lüda People's Daily)

### 如何开展合理化建议运动？

　　如何开展合理化建议运动？
    三年来，旅大工人和职员由于阶级觉悟的提高和学习了苏联工业管理的先进经验，在开展合理化建议运动方面，已获得了不少成绩。据统计，仅一九四八年一年，职工在生产上提出的合理化建议即达一四二六件。尤其在今年拥党竞赛期间，合理化建议运动更得到进一步推广，因而提高了生产效率，降低了成本，按期完成或超过了生产计划。
    但这个运动还开展得很不普遍，在中苏企业主要的工厂因为领导上比较有计划有组织，合理化建议运动的开展比较广泛深入，部分公营企业由于重视这一工作，也收到很大成效，但还有不少企业工厂对这一运动未引起应有的重视，或随创模或立功运动热轰一阵，过后又消沉下去。所以当旅大职工总会提出以开展合理化建议作为下半年中心工作时，必须解决几个思想和组织领导问题。
    一、通过合理化建议提高生产水平
    开展合理化建议运动的前提是企业行政和工会负责人的重视，否则合理化建议就会停留在口头上。合理化建议是创模和立功运动发展的更高阶段，因为“突击”或高度发挥劳动强度，究竟是有时间和体力限制的，而技术上的发明创造或工作方法的改进则是永久的。更重要的是合理化建议的经验一经传播交流，一般的较易为大多数职工所接受，甚至易于为技术不熟练的工人所模仿，因而可以提高整个生产水平。
    二、纠正片面看法和过高要求
    长时期我们对合理化建议的认识有片面或狭隘的地方。一般的，我们已经重视了工人积极性的发挥，而对合理化建议的提倡，也就是对工人创造性的发挥重视不够；过去对合理化建议的了解偏重于技术上或机器工具的发明改革（当然这是需要的而且是重要的），而未能从对生产有利的各个方面去开动脑筋。即或有些改进，觉得不值得什么，工人也不愿向别人说，就是说了，行政既不发扬，又不扩大推广，也不计算价值。这个思想的存在使工作走了不少弯路，也埋没了很多优秀工人的创造。
    苏联各企业的合理化改革给我们很大启发。如莫洛托夫汽车工厂工人、工程师在今年四个月中提出了一万件生产合理化的建议，使工厂在一年内节约三千万卢布；又如巴库旋盘工阿柯巴夫、卡希莫夫和葛敏斯基建议用下班后的几分钟把车床整理一下，准备好工作位置，以便换班者接班即可开车工作，因而使产量提高百分之十五。从此可看出合理化建议的范围是非常广阔，而内容也是非常丰富的。
    合理化建议的面是很宽的，所以工厂管理者和职工会负责同志就应该从多方面去启发和诱导职工开动脑筋，多想办法。有次有一位厂长谈起合理化建议问题，他说：“过去有工人对生产提出些改进的意见，我总问能提高效率百分之几百，若不能提高一倍或节省一倍的人工就拉倒了。”为什么要求这样高呢？假如现有生产效率是百分之百，再提高百分之五或百分之十不好吗？总比现有的水平提高了。
    三、有组织有计划的推行
    合理化建议运动的开展，不仅仅要提倡要宣传，更重要的是要有组织有计划。为有组织有计划的开展合理化建议运动，在工厂内由工程师、技术人员和职工中优秀分子建立一定的组织，专来发动、计划、推广合理化建议是有必要的。如铁路工厂的技术悬赏，电化工厂的合理化建议委员会，中华电气工厂的“招立功”委员会等经验均值得学习，否则易于形成自流。
    其次，在苏联各企业部门实行二、三十年的生产会议的成功经验，尤值得我们学习和推广。在苏联各工厂、矿井及其他企业部门，每月要定期举行一两次由工人、工程师、技术工作者、行政和职工会的代表组织的生产会议，在这个会议上讨论生产计划、对改善生产组织和劳动过程的建议、原材料的节约、提高劳动生产率及降低成本的措施，还交流合理化建议的经验，讨论合理化与发明的建议等等问题，所以对社会主义生产建设起了伟大的作用。库兹涅佐夫同志曾说：“生产会议是促进吸引广大劳动群众直接参加社会主义建设的群众生产工作的最有效方式之一。”我们工厂有不少会议，但缺乏定期的专门研究改进技术，提高生产，讨论合理化建议的会议，有的有不定期的会议，但未很好贯彻和总结经验。
    合理化建议是件非常细腻的科学的组织工作，有一定的组织来领导掌握，还应建立手续和纪律。如建议者事先必须报告，得到工程师或技术长审核批准后，才能着手试验，经过三个月到半年的试验，证明完全成功后，才能推行全厂。不这样，就打乱了生产秩序，甚至发生只顾产量忽视质量，或只顾部分不顾整体的偏差。
    四、要有一套奖励办法
    根据发明创造或合理化建议所产生的价值及降低成本的多少，给予不同的奖励，这样才能把工人群众的政治觉悟与物质鼓励、个人利益与社会利益结合起来。
    目前在中苏企业部门已经实行和正在实行一套完整的奖励办法，就是根据一九四二年苏联人民委员会颁布的“发明与技术改进及生产合理化建议的奖励条例”；而公营企业多数没有，或有亦缺乏科学的计算。因此我们要学习采用苏联的办法。
    五、很好的总结和推广经验
    为顺利开展合理化建议运动，还必须很好的总结和推广合理化建议的经验。当合理化建议已形成运动时，除报纸应有组织有计划报道外，职总和各大企业也必须组织各种座谈会，总结和交流合理化建议的经验，以使扩大推行。
    有组织有计划地开展合理化建议是件新的工作，愿我们共同向苏联学习，在实际工作中学习，创造和积累经验，提高生产水平。　　　（旅大人民日报）
