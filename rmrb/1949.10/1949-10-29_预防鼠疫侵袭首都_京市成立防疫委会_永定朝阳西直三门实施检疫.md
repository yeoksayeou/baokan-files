In order to prevent the plague from invading the capital, the Beijing Municipal People's Government convened a temporary government affairs meeting yesterday (28th) to discuss the steps and methods for epidemic prevention in the city. First, Deputy Mayor Zhang Youyu reported on the occurrence and spread of the plague in Chahar and the government's epidemic prevention measures. Subsequently, it was decided to establish the Beijing Municipal Epidemic Prevention Committee, with Mayor Nie Rongzhen as the director and Deputy Mayor Zhang Youyu and Health Bureau Director Zhang Wenqi as deputy directors. Letters of appointment will be drafted by the municipal government to invite relevant figures from all walks of life in the city to serve as standing committee members or committee members of the Epidemic Prevention Committee. The committee will be formally established this morning and will hold its first meeting immediately. The "Provisional Regulations for Plague Prevention in Beijing" and the epidemic prevention plan drafted by the municipal government, including the establishment of several quarantine stations and several epidemic prevention injection teams in urban and suburban areas, as well as the launch of an epidemic prevention campaign throughout the city starting next week to carry out epidemic prevention propaganda and rat-catching cleaning campaigns, were all discussed in detail at the meeting and will be submitted to the Beijing Municipal Epidemic Prevention Committee for discussion and decision before being implemented immediately.
　　[Beijing News] Since receiving intelligence about the occurrence of plague in Chahar and the vicinity of Zhangjiakou, the Beijing Municipal Health Bureau has made necessary preparations for emergency and effective measures to prevent and control the disease. Starting on the 27th, in close coordination with the Public Security Bureau, it was stipulated that all long-distance buses and passengers coming to Beijing from Zhangbei and other areas must undergo quarantine at Yongding, Chaoyang, and Xizhi three gates before being allowed to enter the city. At the same time, quarantine stations were established at these three gates to implement quarantine day and night. If suspected patients are found, they will be forcibly sent to infectious disease hospitals for isolation and treatment immediately. On the 28th, six groups of personnel were dispatched, each led by a physician, to Tongzhou, Qianmen, Xizhimen three stations and Yongding, Chaoyang, and Xizhi three city gates to carry out quarantine and flea extermination work.
