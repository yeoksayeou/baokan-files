　　North China Highway General Bureau
  　Launches Learning Competition
  　Deeply Studies CPPCC Documents
    [This Newspaper] In order to elevate learning from its original basis and study the CPPCC documents more deeply, the Learning Committee has organized a learning competition and elected learning models. First, leading cadres made thorough mobilizations in various units. Then, the Learning Committee convened a joint meeting of all learning group leaders to review and criticize the past erroneous views that did not value learning. Everyone agreed that the one and a half hours of learning time each morning was too short and decided to increase the learning time. It was also decided that they would read the documents themselves and conduct group discussions in the morning. At the same time, each unit would elect a representative to form a learning model evaluation committee, which would stipulate the standards for evaluating performance. The evaluation committee members would go deep into each unit to understand the situation in order to evaluate performance. The unit with the highest score would be awarded a large red flag for learning models. Simultaneously, each unit would hold individual democratic evaluations, and the average of the evaluation scores and each person's test scores would be taken. The top three with the highest scores would receive individual learning model awards. After such separate mobilization and arrangements, everyone's enthusiasm increased. The General Affairs Section, which had been relatively lax in learning, took the lead in making a guarantee to everyone: study on time, not do other things during study time, everyone speak during discussions, and persist in two hours of study every night, taking notes while reading. The Personnel Section challenged the Secretariat; the Management Section made a plan to guarantee that it would win the red flag. Now, anytime and anywhere, people are heard discussing learning and plans to compete for the red flag, and a learning upsurge has been universally launched. (Xian Lizhi)

　　华北公路总局
  　展开学习竞赛
  　深入学习人民政协文件
    【本报讯】华北公路总局为了把学习从原有基础上再提高一步，更深入地学习人民政协文件，学委会特组织学习竞赛，选举学习模范。首先由各领导干部在各单位作了深入动员，学委会又召集各学习小组长开联席会议，检讨与批判过去不重视学习的错误观点，大家认为每天早上一个半钟头的学习时间太短，决定增加学习时间。并决定自己阅读文件，早上分小组集体讨论；同时每个单位选出一个代表来组成学习模范评定委员会。规定评订成绩的标准。各评定委员深入到各单位里面去了解情况，以便评定成绩。得分最高的单位奖励学习模范大红旗一面。同时各单位举行个人的民主评定，评定的成绩与各人测验成绩平均，得分最高的前三名，获个人学习模范奖励。这样分别动员布置后，大家的情绪提高了。平时学习比较松懈的总务股，首先向大家提出了保证：按时学习，学习时间内不作别的事情，讨论时大家发言，每晚坚持两小时学习，阅读时记笔记。人事处向秘书室提出了挑战；管理科作出了计划，保证要争红旗。现在随时随处，都听到有人在谈论学习与争红旗的计划，学习热潮已普遍地掀起了。　　（先立志）
