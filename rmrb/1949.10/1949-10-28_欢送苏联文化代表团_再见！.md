　　Farewell to the Soviet Cultural Delegation
    Goodbye!
    Guo Moruo
    Friends of the Soviet delegation of literary, artistic, and scientific workers, you have been here for a whole month, and you have been busy for a whole month. Your arrival has already given us great encouragement, and you have tirelessly provided us with many valuable experiences in various fields. Not only in Beijing and Tianjin, but also as far away as Nanjing and Shanghai. This is something that makes us very inspired.
    "Listening to your words is better than reading books for ten years."
    We would like to thank you with brotherly affection, wish you good health, and hope that you can come again in the near future. We will repay your and the Soviet people's deep friendship with hard study, hard work, and good results.
    Although we are separated, our spirits are forever tightly embracing each other. No space or time can separate our embrace.
    Goodbye, dear friends, goodbye!

　　欢送苏联文化代表团　
    再见！
    郭沫若
    苏联文学艺术科学工作者代表团的朋友们，你们来了整整一个月，你们也忙了整整一个月。你们的到来已经给予了我们很大的鼓励，而且更毫不倦怠地在各方面向我们提供出了许许多多宝贵的经验。不仅在北京天津，而且还远远到过南京上海。这是使我们非常感奋的事。
    “听君一席话，胜读十年书”。
    我们谨以兄弟的情谊向你们感谢，祝你们健康，更希望你们在不久的将来能够再来。我们将以努力学习，努力工作，做出很好的成绩来，作为对于你们的和苏联人民的深厚友谊的报答。
    我们虽然分别了，但我们的精神是永远紧紧地拥抱着的。没有任何的空间和时间可以隔离我们的拥抱。
    再见，亲爱的朋友们，再见！
