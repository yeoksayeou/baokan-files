[Beijing News] The Capital People's Sports Meet held its final preparatory committee meeting on the 19th in the conference room of the Municipal Education Bureau to inspect the various preparations. Representatives from over twenty units attended, including the Municipal Education Bureau, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Municipal Joint Association of Primary and Secondary School Teachers, the Beijing Sports Research Association, the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Communist Youth League, the Municipal Student Federation, the Municipal Farmers Association, and the Municipal Public Security Bureau. Xu Yingchao, Director of the Physical Education Department of Normal University, Ma John, Director of the Physical Education Department of Tsinghua University, Liu Ren and Li Leguang of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and others were present to provide guidance. This sports meet, held to celebrate the birth of the People's Republic of China, marks the beginning of the new sports movement. The programs in which the various units are participating mostly contain political education significance celebrating the founding of the People's Republic of China. The programs prepared by factories, schools, and troops all highly demonstrate collectivism and creativity. The departments participating in the performances and competitions are also relatively broad, and the number of people is also very large. Taking the primary and secondary school student group as an example, in the preliminary rounds in the districts on the 15th, there were 24,000 athletes and over 100 programs. After the evaluation, the selected excellent programs included 45 items such as "Liberation Flowers Bloom Everywhere" from the First Affiliated Primary School of Normal University, "We are Democratic Youths" from Huiwen and Muzhen schools, and "Great Unity Gymnastics" from Guanghua Girls' High School. The conference will feature the "Worker's Dance" from the Shijingshan Power Plant in the worker group, the "Bayonet Dance" from the Corps of Order in the military group, acrobatics from the Hui Nationality College, and special performances such as the "Tibetan Dance" and "Mongolian Dance," as well as track and field events, totaling more than 80 events. The conference was originally scheduled to be held on the 22nd and 23rd, but in response to the enthusiastic demands of factories, schools, and organizations, the preparatory committee specifically decided to extend the meeting by one day until the 24th. Furthermore, visiting delegations from the Northwest, Northeast, East China, Central China, Tianjin and other places have successively arrived in Beijing. The capital's first sports meet will play a demonstrative role nationwide.
