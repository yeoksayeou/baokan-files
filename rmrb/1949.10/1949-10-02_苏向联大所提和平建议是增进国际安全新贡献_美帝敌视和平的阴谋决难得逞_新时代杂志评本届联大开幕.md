Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 1st: TASS, Moscow: The "New Era" magazine published an editorial on September 28th entitled "The Fourth Session of the United Nations General Assembly." The editorial stated: The proposals made by the head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, on behalf of the Soviet government to the Fourth Session of the United Nations General Assembly are a new contribution by the great socialist country to the promotion of peace and international security.

The importance and significance of these Soviet proposals are very clear. Their direct purpose is to enhance peace and international security. Therefore, the Soviet proposals have received the warmest response in the camp of peace-loving people and the full support of the masses of people in all countries of the world.

Under the light of the Soviet proposals, the efforts of the U.S.-British bloc to undermine the United Nations, to shake the foundations of the United Nations, and to turn the United Nations into a tool of imperialist conspiracies have become even more dismal.

What exactly have the representatives of Washington and London proposed to the United Nations General Assembly? The head of the U.S. delegation, Acheson, has once again, as he has suggested many times before, proposed that the United Nations should once again eat the filthy dishes of the "Balkan Committee" and the "Korean Committee," two committees that were established in violation of the UN Charter. He cited the myth of "infringement of religious freedom" in Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania, demanding illegal interference in the internal affairs of these countries. On the other hand, on the fundamental issues of banning atomic weapons and reducing armaments, the U.S. Secretary of State is clearly willing to prevent the United Nations from taking action. Acheson cautiously avoided talking about the issue of banning atomic weapons, and he once again tried to establish U.S. domination in atomic energy under the guise of "international control." As for the reduction of armaments, Acheson said that there are "no signs of any immediate universal agreement." In other words, the U.S. delegation is willing to have the United Nations close its eyes and not see the mad arms race, and to make the United Nations a smokescreen behind which Wall Street monopolists can肆意地为所欲为. For this purpose, the old method of forcing the United Nations General Assembly to adopt resolutions desired by the U.S. imperialists by means of a voting machine is being carried out again. Turning the United Nations into a direct tool of imperialist policies aimed at opposing the Soviet Union and the people's democracies—this is the task entrusted to the political cooks in Washington and London by their masters, the monopolists, who are trying to impose their will on the whole world.

### 苏向联大所提和平建议是增进国际安全新贡献  美帝敌视和平的阴谋决难得逞　 新时代杂志评本届联大开幕

　　苏向联大所提和平建议是增进国际安全新贡献
    美帝敌视和平的阴谋决难得逞
    新时代杂志评本届联大开幕
    【新华社北京一日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：“新时代”杂志于九月二十八日发表题为“联合国第四届大会”的社论。社论说：苏联代表团团长维辛斯基代表苏联政府向联合国第四届大会所提出的建议，乃是伟大的社会主义国家对于增进和平及国际安全的新贡献。
    苏联代表团这些建议的重要性和意义，是十分明显的。其直接目的，乃在于增进和平及国际安全。因此，苏联的建议在和平拥护者的阵营中获得最热烈的响应，并获得世界上一切国家的人民群众的充分支持。
    在苏联建议的照耀之下，美英集团企图破坏联合国、企图摇撼联合国的基础、企图把联合国变成帝国主义阴谋的工具的努力，已显得更加惨淡了。
    华盛顿和伦敦的代表，究竟向联合国大会建议了些什么呢？美国代表团团长艾奇逊又象以前建议过许多次的那样，再次建议联合国重新去吃“巴尔干委员会”和“朝鲜委员会”这盘龌龊不堪的菜，这两个委员会是侵犯联合国宪章而建立的。他引用关于匈牙利、保加利亚和罗马尼亚“侵犯宗教自由”的神话，要求对这些国家的内政加以非法的干涉。另一方面，在禁用原子武器和裁减军备这些基本问题上，美国国务卿显然愿意使联合国不采取行动。艾奇逊谨慎地避免谈到禁用原子武器的问题，他并再一次力图在“国际管制”的借口之下确立美国在原子能方面的统治权。至于裁减军备，艾奇逊说目前“没有立即获得普遍协议的任何征象”。换句话说，美国代表团愿意叫联合国闭起眼睛，不去看疯狂的军备竞赛，并且使联合国成为烟幕，使华尔街垄断资本家可以在这个烟幕后面放肆地为所欲为。为了这个目的，借助于表决机器来硬要联合国大会通过美国帝国主义者所企望的议案的这种老办法，又在进行了。把联合国变成直接的旨在反对苏联和人民民主国家的帝国主义政策的工具——这就是他们的主子垄断资本家对华盛顿和伦敦政治厨师所嘱咐的任务，这些垄断资本家竭力想把他们的意志强加于全世界。
