　　Rectification and Development of the Coal Mining Industry in the Mentougou Mining Area, Western Beijing
　　The Mentougou mining area in western Beijing has a long history of mining. The area, stretching from Shixia in the west to Hunhe River in the east, and from Dongxinxingfang, Dayu, and Heishan in the south to Chengzicun, Zhou's Tomb, and Jiulong Mountain in the north, covers an area of 9,256.7 mu. In 1915, Zhou Fengzhang, a Sino-British coal mining rights holder, applied for mining rights over nearly half of the entire Mentougou mining area. Other areas, inside and outside Quanmen, included the Liushichen mining area, the Wanlong mining area in Dayugou, and the Zhang Guangling mining area in Xipo, Chengzicun, among others, totaling more than a dozen. Only the Sino-British, Siwei, Hongshun, and Zhongxing mines used machine mining, mostly concentrated in the west; the east mainly consisted of small, manually operated kilns. At that time, the number of small kilns was not large, and their impact on the mining area was not significant. However, after the Japanese surrender, the Kuomintang government took over the Sino-British mining area. Although there were explicit regulations prohibiting unauthorized mining within the mining area, under the corrupt and greedy reactionary government, some influential individuals disregarded mining engineering and forcibly mined within the national mining area of Dayu and Chengzi, resulting in as many as 271 small kilns. Most of these small kilns within the mining area did not leave coal pillars or drain accumulated water. They often dug tunnels that connected, leading to frequent collapses. During the rainy season, water from all directions flowed into the large mines, greatly affecting production and public mining projects, seriously damaging the health and development of the mining area.

　　After liberation, the Military Control Commission and the People's Government, on the one hand, aimed to develop production and, based on the principles of protecting industry and commerce and considering both public and private interests, rectified public coal mines and supported private kilns. On the other hand, to safeguard public and private mining rights and protect legitimate industry and commerce, preventing production from being disrupted, they adopted a policy of curbing and managing illegal mining activities by small kilns that seriously damaged the health of the mining area.

　　Significant progress has been made in developing public mine production. The Mentougou mining area was liberated on December 15th last year. In the first three months of this year, the three major public coal mines, Mentougou, Chengzi, and Xishan, completed a production plan of 94,000 tons. In June, this increased to 54,500 tons. In the same month, private kilns increased their output to 57,300 tons, bringing the total output to over 111,900 tons. July and August are typically low-production months due to the rainy season. This year, rainfall exceeded previous years. To compensate for the losses during the rainy season and increase coal production, the Pingxi Coal Mining Company plans to vigorously drain the accumulated water from the Mentougou mine and actively develop the Chengzi, Liangxiang, and Datai mines.

　　Secondly, in supporting private kilns, three methods were adopted: purchase by approval, fixed-order loans, and assistance with drainage. For example, the Trading Company paid in advance to purchase coal, reaching over 95,300 tons from January to March. From January to May, the Zhongxing, Siwei, and Hongshun mines alone produced no less than 80,000 tons. This allowed kiln owners to have sufficient capital to continuously expand production. In addition, the Pingxi Mining Bureau introduced the Zhongxing, Siwei, and Hongshun mines to the Bank of Communications, which provided fixed-order loans. Since June, these three machine-operated mines have received 51,057,570 yuan. Recently, it also introduced more than 20 small, manually operated kilns, such as Qishun, Hechun, and Taixing, to negotiate loans with the bank, totaling over 30 million yuan. The bank is currently investigating and processing these applications. During the recent rainy season, most small kilns suspended operations due to lack of drainage equipment. Plans are now underway for the Pingxi Coal Mining Company to provide drainage, with the costs to be gradually repaid from future coal production. This measure will allow many currently closed small kilns to resume operations and increase coal production.

　　Thirdly, small kilns engaged in illegal mining that damaged the mining area and affected mine development were persuaded to relocate or change industries. Those who refused to listen to persuasion and continued illegal mining were subject to closure. After liberation, many small kilns in the Mentougou mining area, still following the bad practices of the Kuomintang reactionary government era, indiscriminately mined at will. For example, in early April, the Fulik kiln dug through to the Chengzi mine's tunnel, costing the Chengzi mine 140,000 jin of millet in engineering expenses to repair the breach (without repair, rainwater would have flooded the mine during the rainy season). Furthermore, coal kilns such as Yongsheng and Deyi were mining only 20 meters away from the third tunnel of the Chengzi mine. In addition, some small kilns did not leave coal pillars, did not drain accumulated water, and clustered together, frequently causing breakthroughs and collapses, endangering the lives and safety of workers. During the rainy season, water flowed into the large mines. For example, the Mentougou mine's main shaft was flooded due to the failure of small kilns to drain accumulated water. This year's rainy season caused the water level to rise from 1,100 feet below ground to 450 feet below ground, and drainage costs currently average 50,000 jin of millet per day. Since the establishment of the Pingxi Mining Bureau in early May, management of these small kilns has been strengthened, and those causing more serious damage have been closed. Including the period under the Military Control Sub-committee's Industrial and Mining Department, a total of twelve coal kilns, including Fuli and Minshun, were completely closed, and the cross-border mining sections of six coal kilns, including Deyi and Dexing, were closed.

　　After the closure of the small kilns, the government, trade unions, and coal mining companies took separate measures to resettle the workers to ensure their livelihoods. Of the 562 workers from the small kilns closed in May, 480 were introduced to other kilns, and the rest found work on their own. In July, more than 30 were introduced to the Longyan Iron Mine, 350 went to the Datai Coal Mine, and another group joined worker training classes. Of the 1,850 workers who lost their jobs due to the Mentougou mine suspending operations in August due to rain, most were resettled in mines such as Heishan and Datai, and efforts are being made to resettle the remaining hundred or so.

　　In addition, to take care of the interests of the owners of the closed small kilns, in addition to advising them to change industries or relocate mining operations, the buildings and other equipment above and below the kiln shafts were valued by both the public mine and the private kiln owners through negotiation and discounted accordingly.

　　These facts demonstrate that the People's Government has correctly implemented the general policy of considering both public and private interests and developing production in the coal mining industry in the Western Beijing mining area. After the promulgation of the "Provisional Regulations on the Management of Coal Mining in the Pingxi District (Draft)," all new and old kilns in the Western Beijing area must be re-registered and their mining boundaries redefined. This work will soon be undertaken by the Western Beijing Mining Bureau. In the future, legitimate mining operations will be further guaranteed and encouraged, and coal production in the Western Beijing area will increase on the existing basis.

　　京西门头沟矿区煤矿业的整顿与发展
    京西门头沟矿区开采历史很久，其中西自石垧，东至浑河，南自东西辛房、大峪、黑山，北至城子村、周氏坟、九龙山一带，面积九、二五六·七亩。几占全门矿二分之一的矿区，在一九一五年为中英煤矿矿权人周奉章所请领；其他在圈门内外有刘士臣等矿区、大峪沟万隆矿区、城子村西坡张广龄矿区等十数家。机器开采的煤矿只有中英、四维、宏顺、中兴等，多集中西部；东部则多为人力开采的小窑。当时小窑数目尚不太多，对矿区影响亦不太大，直到日寇投降后，国民党政府接管中英矿区，当时虽亦有明文规定矿区内不得随意擅自滥行开采，但在腐败贪污的反动政府统治下，有些有势力的人不顾矿区工程，在大峪及城子两地国家矿区之内强行滥采，出现小窑竟达二百七十一座之多。小窑在矿区内多数不留煤柱，不抽积水，每将坑道挖通，聚集一处，以致时有坍塌。每遇雨季，各处水均流至大矿，影响生产和公矿工程甚巨，严重矿坏了矿区的健康和发展。
    解放以后，军管会和人民政府一方面为了发展生产，在保护工商业和公私兼顾的原则下，对公营煤矿进行整顿，对私营矿窑则予扶植。另一方面为了维护公私矿权，保护正当工商业，使生产不受破坏影响，对于一些非法开采、严重破坏矿区健康的小窑则采取了制止和管理的方针。
    在发展公矿生产方面，已获有很大成绩。门头沟矿区解放于去年十二月十五日，公营门头沟、城子、西山三大煤矿，今年年初三个月完成了九万四千吨的生产计划。六月份增加到五万四千五百吨，同月私营矿窑的产量增加到五万七千三百吨，合计产量共达十一万一千九百余吨。七、八两月份因系雨季，例年产量均较他月为低，今年雨量超过往年，平西煤矿公司为了弥补雨季的损失及增加煤产，今后准备除了大力排泄门头沟矿的积水外，并积极建设城子、良乡、大台三矿。
    其次在扶植私营矿窑方面，采取了批购、定货贷款及协助排水三种方式。例如由贸易公司以先行付款批购煤斤的方式，从一月到三月中间即达九万五千三百余吨；从一月到五月，仅中兴、四维、宏顺三家即不下八万吨。因此煤窑业主得以周转，能够继续不断扩大再生产。此外，由平西矿务处介绍到交通银行，由银行定货贷款的，从六月以来，已有中兴、四维、宏顺等三家机采矿，贷到五一、○五七、五七○元。最近又介绍人力开采的启顺、合纯、泰兴等二十多家小窑向银行接洽贷款，共约三千多万元，银行方面正在调查办理中。最近雨季中小窑因无排水设备，多数停采，现正计划由平西煤矿公司代为排水，排水费用则由将来产煤中陆续偿还。这一措施可使目前许多停采的小窑复工，并且可以增加煤的产量。
    再次，对于非法滥采破坏矿区、影响矿山发展的小窑，则进行说服劝告使其转地或改业；劝告不听仍继续滥采的小窑，则予以封闭的处分。因为解放以后门头沟矿区内许多非法开采的小窑，仍沿袭过去在国民党反动派政府统治时期的恶劣作风，肆意滥挖。例如福利煤窑四月初挖透至城子矿＠道，致使城子矿花费工程费十四万斤小米才把这一漏洞补起（不填补起来，雨季水即由此灌入大井）。又如永生、德义等煤窑，采煤之处距离城子矿第三＠＠道仅二十余米。另外有些小窑则采煤不留煤柱，不抽积水，蜂聚一处，时常发生穿透塌陷，致工人生命安全无保障。到了雨季水都流向大矿，如门矿大井因小窑不抽积水而使水灌入矿井，今年雨季从地下一千一百英尺淹到距地四百五十英尺，排水费用现在每天平均达五万斤小米。自五月初平西矿务处成立以后，对于此等小窑的管理加强，对于破坏情形较为严重的均予封闭。连同以前军管分会工矿部期内，前后共封闭了福利、民顺等十二个煤窑的全部及德义、德兴等六个煤窑之越界开采的部分。
    小窑封闭之后，为了照顾工人生活，经政府、工会、煤矿公司分别予以安置。计五月封闭之小窑工人五百六十二名，介绍到其他矿窑的四百八十名，其余自行转工；七月份介绍至龙烟铁矿三十余名，赴大台煤矿三百五十余名，另一部分则加入了工人训练班学习；八月份门矿因雨停采而失业的工人一千八百五十名，大部亦经分别安置于黑山、大台等矿，目前尚有百余人正在设法安置中。
    另外为了照顾被封小窑窑主的利益，除了劝告转业或易地开采外，其窑井上下的房屋建筑及其他器材，酌量由公营矿方与私人窑主双方协议估价折让。
    上面这些事实，说明了人民政府在京西矿区内对于煤矿事业是正确的执行了公私兼顾、发展生产的总的方针的。“平西区煤矿业开采管理暂行条例（草案）”公布以后，京西区所有新旧矿窑均须重新登记、重定矿界，这一工作即将由京西矿务处着手办理，今后正当经营的矿窑将更因此得到进一步的保障与鼓励，京西区煤矿的生产，将在现有基础上提高一步。
