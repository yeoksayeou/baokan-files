Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 21st. The Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government Administration Council held its inaugural meeting today. Thirty committee members currently in Beijing attended, along with sixteen observers, including deputy ministers and deputy directors of various departments. Director Chen Yun began by reporting on the development process of past economic work, the current financial situation, and the status of agriculture, industry, and transportation. He then proposed the following key tasks to be undertaken in the coming months: (1) Agriculture: Convene a meeting to tally the total national grain output and study potential increases and methods for increasing production next year; convene a meeting to study how to expand cotton production next year and how to regulate grain in cotton-growing areas; plan for dike repair, well digging, waterwheel construction, and the start of afforestation work. (2) Industry: Calculate the output of several major products, the supply of raw materials, the distribution of finished products, and transportation issues; organize mutual inspections of production conditions in various regions, striving for interconnected production across regions. (3) Commerce: Formulate a purchasing plan for major export products, including purchasing prices and operating methods; formulate a plan for essential imported goods and prepare sufficient foreign exchange; strive to maintain supply and demand balance in several major cities, avoiding price fluctuations caused by supply and demand imbalances. (4) Transportation: Focus primarily on repairing railways along the military frontlines, strengthening existing operating routes, and striving for the rapid opening of several major railways; organize shipping and strengthen inland water and land transportation; unify the national postal and telecommunications services. (5) Finance: Prepare to convene a national financial conference in November or December. All of the above tasks will be led by the respective competent departments, with the assistance of the Planning Bureau in organizing national specialized conferences. Finally, Director Chen emphasized that the various departmental organizations should be established quickly, and organizational regulations for each department should be formulated. Following this, Secretary-General Xue Muqiao reported on the internal situation of the Financial and Economic Committee's organization. He stated that the Financial and Economic Committee was primarily based on the original North China People's Government Financial and Economic Committee and its subordinate departments, merged with the Financial and Economic Department of the CCP Central Committee. This foundation is incomplete; therefore, some departments under the Financial and Economic Committee can establish organizations based on the corresponding departments of the original North China People's Government, while others must be newly established. A discussion then ensued, with Huang Yanpei, Li Shucheng, Li Lisan, Zhang Naiqi, Qian Changzhao, Ma Yinchu, He Changgong, Bo Yibo, and others speaking in turn. Finally, the following resolutions were passed: (1) To appoint Song Shaowen, Xue Muqiao, Qian Changzhao, Zhang Naiqi, Yu Huanzheng, Qian Jiaju, Hu Ziying, and Li Minxin to draft the organizational regulations for the Financial and Economic Committee for discussion at the next committee meeting. (2) All ministers and deputy ministers should promptly begin work. Personnel from the relevant departments of the original North China People's Government are responsible for reporting on work and handling handovers to the ministers and deputy ministers. (3) Each department should draft its own organizational structure and draft regulations for discussion at the next committee meeting. (4) The issue of how committee members who do not hold departmental positions should carry out their work will be left for discussion at the next committee meeting; in principle, each person must select a relevant specialized issue for investigation and research. (5) The scope of business for the five industrial departments will be exchanged separately first, and if necessary, the Planning Bureau will convene a meeting to resolve the issues. (6) The All-China Federation of Trade Unions is welcome to send representatives to attend meetings of the various industrial departments. (7) It is recommended that the Government Administration Council uniformly take over the personnel and archives of the various departments of the former Nanjing Kuomintang central government.
