　　Several Issues in Language Reform
    Boxan
    After reading Mr. Li Jinxi's "Theory of New National Language Writing" (pamphlet) and Mr. Tang Lan's "Basic Problems of Chinese Character Reform" (published in the People's Daily on October 9th), I saw on the newspaper today that the Language Reform Association has passed the news of researching phonetic script. I have some thoughts on the new writing movement. First, I am glad that many experts and scholars have the enthusiasm for language reform, and generally agree with the phonetic new script. Secondly, I feel that some issues of principle still need to be discussed in depth to reach a unified understanding, and then we can reach a common conclusion; otherwise, the specific plans of each person are too different, and it is not easy to come up with a clue, and the result will delay this movement.

    New Writing and Old Writing
    In the early stage of promoting the new script, the old script cannot be abolished, because the new script will not be perfect all at once, and there will not be many new script reading materials all at once. Old Chinese characters are still needed to help and supplement the shortcomings of the new Chinese characters. However, we new writing activists cannot overly accommodate the old writing and erase the independence of the new writing. Now Mr. Tang Lan believes that there are a particularly large number of homophones in the Chinese language, and it is not easy to understand and express using pure phonetic writing; while Mr. Li Jinxi believes that the dialects of the Chinese language are too complex, and the new script cannot be independent from the old Chinese characters until the pronunciation of Chinese characters reaches complete unity. Their conclusions both deny the independence of the new script (we are talking about relative independence). I think this idea is somewhat hindering the new writing movement. Based on the experience of the past new writing movement, we new writing workers believe that the independent use of the new script is entirely possible, although the new script is not very thorough, this shortcoming can be overcome in the process of use. The so-called problem of homophones is not very serious. We can learn from the experience of other countries in dealing with homophones. As for the difference between Northern and Southern dialects, and the possibility of producing several new scripts at the same time, do these new scripts necessarily have to go through the medium of Chinese characters in reading and writing? This is a question that comes from the minds of us intellectuals. A person who does not know square characters at all can easily learn the new script that is written from their own familiar dialect, whether reading or writing. After learning this one, it is not very difficult to further learn the common language (national language) new script, because they belong to the Han Chinese language family, and the grammar and vocabulary are generally the same. A few dissimilar dialects and local languages are also easy to communicate and understand each other after being written, such as the Northern "bie niu" (awkward) and the Guangzhou "heng ba lang" (clumsy). If it is said that the vocabulary of spoken language is not enough, and we have to rely on the help of old Chinese character articles, we agree with this in principle. We can absorb many intellectuals' vocabulary into the new script reading materials, and rely on the help of the new script reading materials to make them spread to the spoken language of the majority of people. We do not believe that the vocabulary of intellectuals must be written in old Chinese characters and cannot be written in new Chinese characters (I think the Chinese Han language new script can be called new Chinese characters, but it does not mean that it is phoneticized word by word from old Chinese characters). The question is whether intellectuals are willing to abandon their own position and serve the people sincerely. If they are willing, we can advise them to learn the new script to educate illiterate people, and use the new script to write popular reading materials, so that illiterate people can have enough books and newspapers to read after learning the new script. In the future, when the masses themselves can write with the new script, there will be no shortage of new script reading materials.

    On the other hand, we also agree that illiterate people can learn old Chinese characters again through the tool of the new script after learning the new script. At the same time, in this period when square characters cannot but be used, we also agree with Mr. Li's proposal of "new phonetic Chinese character" (new script and square character comparison) reading materials and Mr. Tang Lan's proposal of "synthetic script" (mixture of a few basic Chinese characters and phonetic script) reading materials. However, Mr. Tang Lan's proposed "national form" letters are still worth discussing. We believe that at present, pure new script, new and old script comparison, and new and old script mixing, three methods can be parallel, and we cannot exclusively adopt one and obliterate the remaining two. What we value most should be the pure new script, followed by the new and old script mixing, and then the new and old script comparison. Mr. Tang Lan's proposed synthetic script only uses hundreds of old Chinese characters, which greatly reduces the burden of learning for illiterate people, so it is easier to learn than the new phonetic Chinese characters. (Mr. Li also mentioned this point, he called those few Chinese characters core characters.) Furthermore, phonetic Chinese characters cost more in printing, and cannot be widely used except for a few books. Mr. Li's imagined method of linking new and old scripts together on the type mold in units of words will create more trouble in the beginning, and I am afraid it will not be possible. Even if it can be done, intellectuals who have received classical Chinese education will probably not write exactly according to the words we have selected. Also, Mr. Li said that workers, peasants, and soldiers can use pure phonetic writing to write local dialects, and intellectuals use square characters to write the national language, and rely on the new phonetic Chinese characters (plus the so-called three-track system) to combine with workers, peasants, and soldiers, and there are problems in this. Between the national language and dialects, not only are the pronunciations different, but the vocabularies are also different. For example, "When it comes to farming work, you can't finish talking about it in three days." Whether the "work" and "talk" here are written in phonetic characters or square characters, Southerners cannot understand them, but Northeasterners can. Therefore, the main thing in combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers is to learn the languages of the people in various places. If you can use the language appropriately, intellectuals can combine with them. It is useless to just think of ways to phoneticize. If you write in classical Chinese, you will not understand it even if you phoneticize it.

    National Form and Internationalization
    In the past, there were many advocates of using Japanese "kana" style letters for the letters of the new phonetic script, up to the phonetic alphabet. These all belong to what Mr. Tang Lan calls the national form. After the May Fourth Movement, many people advocated using Roman letters, that is, Latin letters, because this set of letters is commonly used in many countries such as England, France, Germany, and Italy. Using this set of letters to spell Chinese makes it easier for us to learn European characters, and it is also convenient to absorb international scientific terms. At the same time, it is easy for foreigners to learn Chinese, which makes it easy to communicate Chinese and foreign cultures. Moreover, this set of letters has been partially applied in subjects such as mathematics, physics, and chemistry. They are aesthetically pleasing in printing and convenient in writing. Why don't we use them? The forms of phonetic alphabets do not have these advantages. We don't need to cherish this kind of national form like "holding on to the remnants of the old". If you think that foreign forms are absolutely unusable and old habits cannot be changed, then which of the trains, ships, electric lights, and telephones are not foreign? Which one is in line with old habits?

    However, on the other hand, we should also know that adopting Latin letters is only to spell the Chinese language. Everything must take into account the characteristics of our language, so that it is convenient for us to use, especially for the workers and peasants. Some intellectuals who have learned foreign languages well overemphasize internationalization and like to move English and the like into our new writing in their original form. For example, "cocoa" is written as Coco, and "coffee" is written as Coff, which makes most readers have to rack their brains to learn another phoneticization method. This is "subordinating the host to the guest" and is not correct internationalization. When we absorb international languages, we still have to follow our own rules in spelling. For example, the C in "cocoa" and "coffee" must be changed to K. But we must also oppose another bias, which is to phoneticize foreign names and place names according to the translated names of square characters. I saw someone write Stalin as Sydahlin somewhere the other day. This is based on Mr. Lin Handa's plan, adding a vowel after the word "Si" and using an entering tone variant for the word "Da," plus H. This way of writing is really unscientific. Suppose someone translates this name as Shi Da Lin, wouldn't it be written as Shdalin again? The same Stalin is differentiated into many forms according to the different translations of square Chinese characters. Is this acceptable? Therefore, foreign words must be written according to the original phonemes. Only when the letters representing a certain phoneme do not conform to our plan should they be changed. For example, the Russian Stalin uses C to represent the "Si" sound. We must change it to S, and the rest can be inferred.

    Precision and Simplification
    The advantage of the Latinized new Chinese characters is that the spelling is simple, and it does not adopt the tone spelling of the national language Romanization, which makes it easy for the masses to learn. However, in the past, Latinized textbooks only taught people to learn phonetic spelling, but did not teach people to recognize a new set of characters, as if they were asking people to create characters freely after learning phonetic spelling. This kind of oversimplification is not of much benefit to illiterate people, but only harm. First, the pronunciation of spoken language varies from place to place, and there are differences every tens of miles, and even the pronunciation of each person in the same area is not completely the same. If you write arbitrarily without any standards, this kind of writing cannot be fully understood even within a dialect area. It is even more unreliable when used in contracts and official documents. Second, the writing of words together must be based on grammar, but illiterate people do not understand grammar. Although the rules for writing words together are clearly defined, illiterate people cannot figure them out. Therefore, illiterate people will not write together. We know that if the new script does not implement connected writing in units of words, or the connected writing is incorrect, the meaning will be unclear or misleading. Therefore, word standardization is necessary. The so-called word standardization does not necessarily mean writing in the form of Lin Handa's standardized characters (or variant characters), but only fixing them by writing them together, and eliminating some words with unclear sounds. Of course, there are very few characters that have to adopt special forms in terms of glyphs. In this way, illiterate people learn the new script in the same way as learning the old script, learning one character at a time. Although this is a little more difficult than learning phonetics, it is many times easier than learning the old script! First, all the characters are pieced together from twenty-odd letters, and the piecing together has certain rules. Second, it is based on ordinary spoken language and is not profound. Of course, learning in this way is to gradually learn some important new vocabulary, which is from popularization to improvement. I think it is enough to standardize the basic commonly used characters and academic terms for word standardization. As for other spoken words, just spell them freely in the article, and we don't have to standardize them in advance. Furthermore, this kind of standardization is done separately by dialect regions, and it is not a unique standard prescribed within the national scope. So it will never hinder the free development of the masses in the new script. We intellectuals are responsible for standardizing the writing of the masses' language based on the masses' language and then handing it over to the masses as a basis for further development. If you only teach the new script based on a plan and a character lookup table, it is barely acceptable for intellectuals, but absolutely unacceptable for illiterate people. Some people may say that illiterate people can understand by reading new script reading materials written in local dialects after learning phonetic spelling, and there is no need to teach them anymore. This is certainly true. But on the other hand, there is also the problem of writing. For this, only the basic common vocabulary is compiled into the elementary textbooks, so that the learners can all contact, and he will write in the same way. May I ask whether the British, French, and others who use phonetic scripts learn their national characters one by one? As long as you learn phonetic spelling, you can graduate. Where in the world is there such an easy language to learn? We new script activists must never have an overly simplistic and sloppy mentality. As a script, it must be quite precise.

    However, precision should not be excessive, as long as it can be barely applied. We must temporarily let go of some of the shortcomings of the new script and let them gradually be overcome in the process of use by the masses. The reason is that some unnecessary regulations may restrain the natural and proper development of the new script. Mr. Lin Handa said it well: "If a thing is planned too meticulously when it is first created, it will hinder the evolution of the thing. In other words, the shortcomings of Chinese phonetic script, as long as they can be improved at any time, are the motive for the evolution of Chinese language. If the shortcomings are completely made up prematurely, it will hurt the natural development of language." Therefore, paying too much attention to the differences in glyphs, such as Mr. Tang Lan's "safe form" and the use of "semantic components" of old Chinese characters, obviously violates the conventions of phonetic script, and Mr. Lin Handa's "variant characters" also seem to be too numerous. I think the use of special forms must be reviewed character by character as advocated by Comrade Qu Qiubai, and only used when absolutely necessary. If a word has several meanings, it is not necessary to differentiate it because the meaning can be determined from the context in application. If the meaning cannot be determined from the context, then it must be differentiated. The first method of differentiation is to use other synonyms. If there are no other synonyms to use, we will use a special form in terms of glyphs. In this way, Lin's variant characters can still be reduced a lot. (However, the special forms as few as those in the early Latinized new script are obviously not enough. Because at that time, although there were new script reading materials in all aspects, the content involved was very limited, especially in commerce and contract documents, and many problems were still unknown. From today onwards, the new script must be widely applied, and it must be quite precise in the preliminary experimental process.) As for advocating the universal addition of tone symbols, or the addition of tone symbols to all monosyllabic characters, we do not agree with this method, because there is no need for this in the differentiation of homophones.

    Standard Language and Dialect
    The issue of standard language and dialect was once a point of contention between the national language faction and the Latinization faction. But now the Latinization workers admit the need for a national common language, and use the new North China dialect script as the common language, while the national language experts also seem to admit that each dialect region can have its own "national language." The views of the two sides are already very close. However, the name "national language" is not appropriate, and according to Mr. Li's recent explanation, the meaning is particularly divergent and ambiguous. (He said that there are five meanings, for example, it can be interpreted as various languages in the entire Chinese territory, including various dialects of Chinese and languages of various ethnic minorities, and it can also be interpreted as Beijing standard language and national pronunciation, etc.) I think the Han language should be called Chinese, just as the Russian language is called Russian, and not called Soviet national language (although all ethnic minority schools in the Soviet Union have to learn Russian). The languages of various ethnic minorities are called by their ethnic names, and there is no need to confuse them with the national language. Beijing dialect is Beijing dialect, and there is no need to call it the national language. As for whether the common language (or standard language) should be changed from the original phonetic system of the Northern dialect Latinization to the Beijing phonetic system, and whether the Beijing dialect vocabulary should be prescribed as the standard vocabulary, this is a question to be considered.

    The first reason for those who advocate adopting the Beijing phonetic system and prescribing the Beijing dialect vocabulary as the standard language is that a more universal dialect must be designated as the standard, which is a concrete standard. The second reason is that Beijing dialect used to be the standard Mandarin, which is known to a wide range of regions. However, the standard adopted by "Beila" is also very concrete (Shandong phonetic system), and it is more universal than Beijing dialect (the pronunciation of the ge rhyme character conforms to the tradition and Southern pronunciation, and there are few so-called retroflex rhymes in the national language family, which is easy for Southerners to learn), and the phonemes are also more precise (maintaining the tradition of distinguishing between jian and tuan), which is really suitable for the conditions of the common language. Mr. Qiao Yannong, who has many years of experience in teaching the national language (in Guangzhou and Hong Kong), also advocated in his "Basic National Language" that "avoid those uncommon Beijing dialects," such as "shang wu" (noon) and "qu deng er" (match), he believes that "that will directly make scholars afraid of the national language when they see it, and indirectly hinder the unification of our Chinese national language." He also advocated "using less retroflex rhymes in Beijing dialect" to reduce the difficulty of learning. He believes that "you don't have to stick out your tongue to say retroflex rhymes, and it's not necessarily not beautiful." It can be seen that it is possible to use Beijing dialect as the basis of the common language, but it must refer to Beila and make appropriate modifications and reorganizations. The differentiation of jian and tuan sounds, I think, should also be listed as a condition for reorganizing Beijing dialect. In addition to the common language, I think it is appropriate to establish a Latinized new script of pure Beijing dialect. This pure Beijing dialect new script is needed by the workers and peasants in the North, and can also be used as the main basis for the common language new script, but the common language does not necessarily completely follow it. The common language new script can carry a little more artificial elements, and be enriched by intellectuals absorbing better vocabulary from the North and South dialects and international vocabulary. Completely denying the importance of artificial factors and relying purely on nature, I think, is also a kind of ideological bias in language reform work.

    Some people think that the workers and peasants only need dialects, not the common language, only need daily vocabulary, not the intellectuals' vocabulary. This view does not conform to the facts of the new era. In all liberated areas, many political terms have been passed on to the countryside and accepted by the peasants; not to mention the workers, they not only have to learn new vocabulary, but also learn Mandarin. (Workers in the South are very enthusiastic about learning Northern dialect, because they feel that they must master the tool of Mandarin to gather with labor brothers across the country and unite to struggle.) Therefore, the development of dialects and the establishment of a common language can be carried out simultaneously without conflict. Language reform workers should give full play to the spirit of serving the people and earnestly do these two aspects of work well, but do not be the tail of the masses.

　　文字改革的几个问题
    Ｂｏｘａｎ
    读过黎锦熙先生“国语新文字论”（小册子）及唐兰先生“中国文字改革的基本问题”（载十月九日人民日报）以后，今天又在报纸上看见文字改革协会通过研究拼音字的消息。我对新文字运动有一些感想。首先是感到高兴，因为许多专家学者都具有文字改革的热忱，而且大体上都赞同了拼音制的新文字。其次是感到某些原则上的问题，还得加深讨论，求得一致的了解，然后才能得到共同的结论；否则各人的具体方案相差太远，不容易弄出一个头绪来，结果会推延了这个运动。
    新文字和旧文字
    在推行新文字的初期，旧文字是不能废除的，因为新文字一下子不会十分完备，新文字读物一下子也不会有很多，还需要老汉字帮助，补充新汉字的缺陷。可是我们新文字运动者也不能过分迁就旧文字，把新文字的独立性一笔勾消。现在唐兰先生认为中国语言同音字特别多，用纯粹的拼音文字，不容易了解和表达；而黎锦熙先生则认为中国语方言太复杂，在汉字读音未达到完全统一以前，新文字不可能脱离老汉字而独立。他们的结论，都否定了新文字的独立性（我们说的是相对的独立性）。这个思想，我以为对新文字运动是有些儿妨碍的。我们新文字工作者根据过去新文字运动的经验，认为新文字的独立使用完全是可能的，虽然新文字还不很周密，但是在使用的过程中可以克服这个缺点。所谓同音字的问题，并不是十分严重的。任何国的语言，都有许多同音字。别人处理同音字的经验，我们可以学习。至于南北方言不同，同时可能产生几种新文字，在阅读与写作上，这些新文字是不是一定要经过汉字的媒介呢？这是从我们知识分子头脑想出来的问题。一个完全不识方块字的人，学习由自己熟习的方言书面化而来的新文字，无论阅读或写作，都是很容易的。学了这一种以后，进一步学习共通语（国语）新文字，也不甚难，因为同属汉族语，语法和语汇大体是相同的。少数不相同的方言土语，在书面化以后，也容易交流而相互了解，如北方的“别扭”，广州的“亨巴郎”之类便是。如果说口头语的语汇还不够，还得靠旧汉字文章的帮助，这在原则上我们是赞同的，我们可以吸收许多知识分子的语汇到新文字读物里面去，依靠新文字读物的帮助使得它们流传到多数人民的口语中去。我们不相信，知识分子的语汇就一定要用旧汉字写而不能用新汉字（我以为汉语新文字可称为新汉字，但并非由旧汉字逐字拼音的意思）写。问题是知识分子是不是肯放弃本位思想，诚心诚意为人民服务。如果肯的话，我们可以奉劝他们都学习新文字去教育文盲，并用新文字写作通俗读物，使文盲学了新文字，有充分的书报可读。将来大众自己都能用新文字写作，新文字读物是不会缺乏的。
    另一方面，文盲学了新文字之后，通过新文字这个工具再学旧汉字，这也是我们所赞同的。同时，在这个方块字还不能不用的时期，我们也赞同黎先生所主张的“新注音汉字”（新文字和方块字对照）读物和唐兰先生所主张的“综合文字”（少数基本汉字和拼音文字混合）读物，不过唐兰所主张的“民族形式”字母还值得商讨。我们认为，在目前，纯粹新文字，新旧文字对照，新旧文字混合，三种方式可以并行，不能专采一种而抹煞其余的两种。我们最注重的应当是纯粹新文字，其次是新旧混合，再其次才是新旧文字对照。唐兰先生所主张的综合文字只用数百旧汉字，这对于文盲的学习减轻了许多担负，所以比较新注音汉字更容易学习。（这一点黎先生也讲到了，他称那少数汉字为核心字。）再则注音汉字花费印刷成本较大，除少数书籍外，不能广泛应用。黎先生所想象的以词为单位而在字模上把新旧文字连在一块的办法，创始的麻烦更多，恐怕无法办到。即便办到，受过文言教育的知识分子恐怕也不会恰好依照我们选定的词儿来写作。还有，黎先生说，工农兵写作可以用纯粹拼音写土话，知识分子写作利用方块字写国语，而靠新注音汉字（加上所谓三轨制）来和工农兵结合，这中间也有问题。国语和方言之间，不但读音不同，语汇也有差别。例如“提起庄稼活，三天唠不完”，这儿的“活”“唠”，无论用拼音字或方块字写，南方人是不能了解的，但东北人则能了解。所以和工农兵结合，主要的是学习各地人民的语言，如果能适当地运用语言，知识分子就可以和他们结合，单单在注音上想办法是没有用的。如果用文言来写，注了音也会完全不懂。
    民族形式和国际化
    拼音新文字的字母，过去主张用日本“假名”式的已经有很多家，直到注音字母为止，这都属于唐兰先生所谓民族形式。五四运动以后，很多人主张用罗马字母即拉丁字母，因为这套字母是英法德意等许多国家通用的，用这套字母拼汉语，使我们学习欧洲文字也容易些，又便于吸收国际上的科学名词，同时外国人学习中文也容易，这就使中外文化容易沟通。而且这套字母，在数理化等科目已经局部地应用，它们在印刷上美观，在书写上也便利，我们为什么不用它们呢？注音字母那一类的形式，的确没有这些优点，我们用不着“抱残守阙”似的来珍惜这种民族形式。如果认为外来的形式绝对不可用，老习惯不可能变更，那么火车轮船电灯电话之类，哪一件不是外来的？哪一件合于老习惯？
    不过另一方面，我们也当知道，采用拉丁字母只是拿来拼写中国的语言，一切都得顾及我们语言的特质，使我们自己用起来方便，尤其要使工农大众用起来方便。有些学好了外国语的知识分子，把国际化强调得过分，喜欢把英文之类照原样子搬到我们的新文字里来，例如“可可”就写Ｃｏｃｏ，“咖啡”就写Ｃｏｆｆｅ，使得多数读者又要伤脑筋来学习另一种拼音方式。这是“喧宾夺主”，不是正确的国际化。我们吸收国际语言，在拼写方式上还得服从我们自己的规律，如“可可”“咖啡”中的Ｃ一定要改成Ｋ才对。但我们又必须反对另一个偏向，就是把外国的人名地名按照方块字的译名来拼音。日前在某处看见有人把斯达林写成Ｓｙｄａｈｌｉｎ，这是依照林汉达先生的方案，在“斯”字后面加了母音，“达”字用了入声变体字，加上Ｈ。这种写法，真是太不科学了。假使有人把这个名字翻译为史大林，那不又会写成Ｓｈｄａｌｉｎ吗？同一个Ｓｔａｌｉｎ，依照方块汉字的不同翻译而分化成许多样子，这还成吗？所以外来语一定要照原来的音素书写，只有代表某一音素的字母与我们的方案不符合的时候，才应该改变它。比方俄文斯达林是以Ｃ表“斯”音，我们必须改成Ｓ，其余的可以类推。
    精密化和简单化
    拉丁化新汉字的好处是拼法简单，不采取国语罗马字的声调拼法，使大众容易学习。可是过去拉丁化课本只教人们学会拼音，并没有教人们认识一套新的文字，似乎是叫人们学会拼音以后，自由去创造文字一样。这样地过分简单，对文盲并没有多大的好处，而只有坏处。第一、各地口语发音纷歧，相隔数十里就有差别，甚至同一地区内各个人的发音也不完全相同，如果任意书写，完全没有标准，这种文字就在一个方言区之内也不能获得充分的相互的了解。用在契约公文上，更不足为凭。第二、词儿连写要根据文法，但文盲是不懂文法的。词儿连写的规则虽然订的明白，但文盲也搞不清楚。因此文盲不会连写。我们知道，新文字如果不实行以词为单位的连写，或者连写不正确，意思就会弄不清楚或者使人误会。所以完全靠文盲去创造新文字，新文字就不能迅速地建立起来。因此词儿定型化是必要的。所谓词儿定型化，并不是一定要照林汉达式的定型字（或叫变体字）来书写，而只是把它们连写固定起来，有些声音不明显的词儿则加以淘汰，当然有极少数的字，在字形上还不得不采用特别形式。这样一来，文盲学习新文字，也和学习旧文字一样，是一个字一个字来学习的。这虽然比光学拼音要困难一点，但是比较学习旧文字不知容易多少倍了！一则因为所有的字都是由二十几个字母拼合起来的，拼合又有一定的规律。二则因为是用普通的口语做基础，并不高深。——当然用这个方法学习，是要逐渐学习一些重要的新语汇的，这就是由普及到提高。我以为，词儿定型化只要把基本的常用字和学术名词定一定就够了，至于旁的口头话，尽管自由拼写到文章里去，我们并不必预先给它定型化。再则这种定型化是各方言区分途去做的，并不是规定全国范围内唯一的标准。所以决不会妨害大众在新文字上面的自由发展。我们知识分子，根据群众的语言，把它们的写法定型化，再交给群众，作为进一步发展的基础，这是应尽的责任。如果只是根据一份方案和一个检字表来教学新文字，对于知识分子虽然勉强可以，对于文盲是绝对要不得的。有些人或者会说，文盲学会了拼音之后，去读用本地口语写的新文字读物就能了解，用不着再教。这固然不错。但另一方面还有写作的问题，为了这，只有在初级课本把基本的常用语汇都编进去，让学习者全部接触，他才会照样写。试问英国人法国人等等使用拼音文字的，对于本国文字难道不是一个一个字学起来的吗？只要学了拼音就可以毕业，世界上哪有这样容易学习的语文？我们新文字运动者决不可再存过分简单化的草率心理。作为一种文字，是不能不相当精密化的。
    不过精密化也不要过分，只要勉强能够应用，就够了。我们必须暂时放任新文字的某些缺点，让它们在群众的使用过程中去逐渐克服。为的是恐怕某些不必要的规定，反而拘束了新文字的自然的正当的发展。林汉达先生说得好：“凡是一种事物在初创的时候，如果计划得太周密，反而会阻碍这种事物的进化。换一句话说，中国拼音文字的缺点，只要可以随时改进，倒是中国语文演进的动机。如果早熟地把缺点完全弥补好，反会斫伤语文的自然发展。”因此过分地注意字形上的分别，如唐兰先生的“安全形式”，采用旧汉字的“形符”，显然是违反拼音文字的常规，而林汉达先生的“变体字”，也似乎数量太多。我以为特别形式的采用，必须象瞿秋白同志所主张的逐字审查，到万不得已的时候才采用。凡是一个词儿有几个意义的，在应用时，从上下文可以决定意义，就不必分化。如果从上下文不能决定意义，那就必须分化。分化的方法，首先是采用别的同义词。如果没有别的同义词可以采用，我们就采用字形上的特别形式。这样一来，林式变体字还可以减少许多。（不过象初期拉丁化新文字那样少的特别形式，就显然不够。因为那时新文字读物虽然各方面都有，究竟所涉及的内容很有限，尤其是在商业上及契约公文方面没有应用过，许多问题还无从知道。今天以后，新文字一定要广泛地应用起来，在初步实验的过程中一定要使它相当精密化。）至于主张普遍加声调符号，或者全部单音字加声调符号的办法，我们也不赞成，因为在同音字分化上没有这个必要。
    标准语和方言
    标准语和方言的问题，过去曾经为国语派与拉丁化派争论之点。但现在拉丁化工作者承认全国共通语的需要，并且拿北方话新文字做共通语，而国语专家似乎也承认各方言区可以有它自己的“国语”，双方见解已经很接近了。不过“国语”这个名称并不妥当，照黎先生最近的解释，意义尤其纷歧含糊。（他说有五种意义，比方，可以解释为中华全境的各种语文，包括汉语的各种方言和各少数民族的语言，也可以解释为北京标准语和国音，等等。）我以为汉族语言应该称为汉语，犹之俄罗斯人的语言叫做俄语，并不叫做苏联国语（虽然苏联各民族学校都得学俄语）。各少数民族的语言各从族名来叫，用不着混称为国语。北京话就是北京话，更不必叫做国语。至于共通语（或标准语）是不是要从北方话拉丁化原来的音系改用北京音系，是不是要把北京的方言语汇规定为标准语汇，这就是待考虑的问题。
    主张采用北京音系并规定北京话语汇为标准语的人，第一个理由是必须指定一种较有普遍性的方言做标准，这才是具体的标准，第二个理由是北京话过去是标准官话，为广大地区所知道。但是“北拉”所采的标准也很具体（山东音系），而且比北京话更具备普遍性（歌韵字读音符合传统及南方音，国语家所谓卷舌韵很少，南方人容易学），音素也比较精密（保持了尖团音分化的传统），实在适合于共同语的条件。具有教授国语的多年经验（在广州、香港）的乔砚农先生，在他所著的“基本国语”里面，也主张“避免那些不通用的北京方言”，好象“晌午”（中午）“取灯儿”（火柴）之类，他认为“那直接会使学者见了国语就怕起来，间接会妨碍我们中国的国语统一。”他又主张“少用北京话里的卷舌韵”以减少学习上的困难，他认为，“你不板起舌头来说卷舌韵，也不见得不漂亮”。可见拿北京话做共通语的基础是可以，但必须参考北拉，加以适当的修改和整理。尖团音的分化，我以为也应列为整理北京话的一个条件。在共通语之外，我觉得建立一种纯粹北京方言的拉丁化新文字是应当的。这种纯粹北京方言的新文字是北方工农所需要的，又可以作为共通语新文字的主要基础，但共通语不一定完全依照它。共通语新文字可以多带一点人为的成分，由知识分子吸收南北方言的较好的语汇及国际的语汇来丰富它。完全否认人为的因素之重要性，纯任自然，我以为也是文字改革工作中一种思想上的偏向。
    有人认为工农大众只需要方言，不需要共通语，只需要日常语汇，不需要知识分子的语汇，这种看法并不符合新时代的事实。凡是解放了的区域，许多政治术语就传到农村，为农民所接受；工人更不用说，他们不但要学新的语汇，而且要学普通话。（南方的工人对北方话的学习很热心，因为他们感到要和全国劳动兄弟聚会一堂，团结奋斗，非掌握普通话这个工具不可。）所以发展方言和建立共通语可以同时进行，不相冲突。文字改革工作者应该发挥为人民服务的精神，把这两方面的工作认真做好，但不要做群众的尾巴。
