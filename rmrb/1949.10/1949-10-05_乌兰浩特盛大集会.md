　　Ulanhot Grand Rally
    [Our Correspondent Ai Fang, Ulanhot, 3rd dispatch] Yesterday, the Mongolian and Han people of Ulanhot and cadres from government offices held a grand rally in the square in front of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government to celebrate the establishment of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and to support lasting world peace. On that day, national flags fluttered in the sky over the city, and colorful slogans in Mongolian and Han languages were dazzling. The streets and alleys were crowded with happy people all day long. Yangko teams from suburban factories and schools, as well as those wearing the unique Mongolian costumes of red and green robes with long sleeves, interspersed with each other. At ten o'clock in the morning, people gathered at the venue. The conference began with the chorus of the March of the Volunteers, played by the military band. Wang Duo of the Inner Mongolia Party Committee gave a speech, saying: Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and Chairman Yunze of Inner Mongolia, the Mongolian and Han people of Inner Mongolia have worked hard and coordinated with the national revolutionary movement to liberate all of China, liberate all of Inner Mongolia, and win today. It was not easy to win this glorious national flag. Looking back on the past and looking forward to the future, we are more deeply in love with the motherland and more hateful of all enemies at home and abroad. Ulan, director of the Inner Mongolia Women's Federation, said: Our legitimate and equal rights as women are guaranteed. We must actively participate in all aspects of national construction as masters and support world peace and smash all the conspiracies of war provocateurs. Ji, Chief of Staff of the Inner Mongolia Military Region Command, shouted loudly to eliminate all remaining enemies, go to Taiwan to capture Chiang Kai-shek alive, and liberate all of China. After the meeting, an unprecedented large-scale parade was held.
