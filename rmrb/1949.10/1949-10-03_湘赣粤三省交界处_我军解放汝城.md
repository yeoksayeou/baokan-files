　　At the Junction of Hunan, Jiangxi, and Guangdong Provinces
  　Our Army Liberates Rucheng
    [Xinhua News Agency, Central China Front, 2nd dispatch] A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army advancing southward along the Hunan-Jiangxi border recovered Rucheng, at the junction of Hunan, Jiangxi, and Guangdong provinces, at midnight on September 29th, annihilating a portion of the remnant bandits. The city had previously been liberated by the People's Liberation Army, but on September 20th, remnant Kuomintang bandits, attempting to prevent the southward advance of the People's Liberation Army, re-occupied the area. However, the morale of the bandit army was low and they were easily startled. They finally abandoned the city in a panic and fled at 8:00 PM on September 29th under the pressure of the advancing People's Liberation Army.

　　湘赣粤三省交界处
  　我军解放汝城
    【新华社华中前线二日电】沿湘赣边境南进的人民解放军某部于九月二十九日午夜收复湘、赣、粤三省交界的汝城，歼残匪一部。该城前曾为解放军解放，九月二十日国民党残匪企图阻止解放军南进，复侵陷该地。但匪军士气沮丧，一日数惊，终于二十九日下午八时在解放军大军压境下狼狈弃城逃窜。
