Visiting Education Representative Cheng Fangwu

"The Chinese Communist Party has always attached great importance to education, and has never relaxed even in the most difficult times." Cheng Fangwu, a representative of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Vice President of North China University, told the reporter at the beginning of the interview. Then, with a tone of reminiscence, he said: Since Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the revolution in 1927, the Chinese Communist Party, in order to continue to lead the Chinese people in the revolution, had to widely enlighten the consciousness of millions of people and educate and train various cadres needed for the revolution. Therefore, it began to establish many schools in the revolutionary base areas. During the ten years of civil war, the governments at all levels led by the Chinese Communist Party had departments specifically in charge of education, responsible for various school education and social education. At that time, the environment was very harsh, and the area was relatively small, so the number and scale of schools could not be compared with later periods; however, this was indeed a good beginning for the Chinese people's education cause, and we feel very happy when we recall it today!

Cheng Fangwu has worked in education in the Liberated Areas for a long time, especially in cadre education. He participated in cadre training work before the War of Resistance Against Japan. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the CPC Central Committee, in order to meet the requirements of advanced young people from all over the country who went to Yan'an, established the Shaanbei Public School, and Cheng Fangwu was appointed as the principal of the school. In 1939, Shaanbei Public School, Lu Xun Academy of Arts, Youth Training Class, and Workers' School merged to form North China United University, and Cheng Fangwu remained the principal. In 1948, North China United University and Northern University merged to form today's North China University, and he continued to serve as vice president. Over the past ten years, tens of thousands of young people have poured into revolutionary posts under his cultivation and education. He happily told reporters: "The students who came out of Shaanbei Public School and North China University have spread all over the country, especially in the North China region."

Cheng Fangwu also described the growth of the people's education cause with his own experience. He said: "After the start of the War of Resistance Against Japan, people's education has developed even more. The vast number of educated youths, driven by patriotism, have flocked to the anti-Japanese democratic holy land - Yan'an. In order to adapt to the new situation, the Chinese Communist Party has successively established various cadre schools to conduct revolutionary political education for them. However, due to the urgent need for cadres in all aspects, most of them were assigned to work posts after only one or two months or even two or three weeks of study. Later, the anti-Japanese base areas gradually expanded, and cadre schools and training classes were even more needed. Various liberated areas successively established many educational units, such as the later North China United University and Northern University; at the same time, ordinary education institutions in the liberated areas, such as primary schools, middle schools, and normal schools, were also universally established. There are no detailed figures, but it can be asserted that during the War of Resistance Against Japan, school education in the liberated areas greatly exceeded the Kuomintang rule. We also have various forms of social education, such as people's night schools, adult literacy classes, workers' schools, women's literacy classes, and winter schools prevalent in various places, which have achieved remarkable results in eliminating illiteracy and improving the political level of the masses. This is a major feature of the people's education cause. Secondly, our education serves the broad masses of the people, so it implements teaching that is consistent with theory and practice. Schools are established according to needs, and students' learning must be linked to practice at all times, and the knowledge gained is used in practice at all times. Therefore, after the students finish their studies, they will definitely have work and be able to take on certain work.

Over the past ten years, schools at all levels in the Liberated Areas have trained no less than hundreds of thousands of cadres, which have played a great role in the War of Resistance Against Japan and the People's Revolutionary War that is currently underway. Cheng Fangwu emphasized here: "The attainment of this great achievement is first of all due to the correctness of the CPC Central Committee's policy of striving for, uniting, educating, and transforming intellectuals, and also the result of the sacrifices and struggles of countless educators."

Finally, when the reporter asked about the future of education in the new China, Cheng Fangwu said optimistically: "Chairman Mao has clearly told us in his opening speech at the People's Political Consultative Conference: 'With the advent of the upsurge of economic construction, an upsurge of cultural construction will inevitably appear.' Our educators must fully understand the meaning of this sentence and be prepared to meet this upsurge. The future of our education work is very bright and promising. We should intensify our work, study hard, and shoulder this great and arduous task!"

Cheng Fangwu further pointed out: Today, the war has not yet ended, and in the situation of economic difficulties, the current central task is first of all the transformation of existing schools. Teaching systems, curriculum content, and teaching methods should be gradually removed of anti-people and reactionary toxins, and made to conform to the spirit of New Democracy. Colleagues in the education field must clearly establish the idea of ​​running education for the people and gradually achieve a fundamental change in the ideological content of our education work. This is the central link in educational reform.

专栏：中国人民政协代表访问记

   　访教育界代表成仿吾
    “中国共产党对于教育事业一直非常重视，就是在最困难的时候，也从未放松过。”中国人民政治协商会议代表，华北大学副校长成仿吾在谈话一开始后，就向记者这样说。接着他又带着回忆的语气说：从一九二七年蒋介石背叛革命的那时起，中国共产党为了继续领导中国人民进行革命，必须广泛地启发千百万人民的觉悟，教育培养革命所需要的各种干部，因此便开始在革命根据地创办许多学校。在十年内战时期，在中国共产党领导的各级政府中就有专管教育的部门，负责各种学校教育与社会教育。当时环境很恶劣，地区又比较小，学校的数目及其规模，自然不能和以后各时期相比较；不过，这确是中国人民教育事业的一个良好开端，今天回忆起来，我们会感到十分愉快！
    成仿吾在解放区做教育工作时间颇长，特别在干部教育方面。抗战前即参加培养干部的工作。抗战爆发后，中共中央为满足各地赴延安的先进青年的要求，曾创办陕北公学，成仿吾即被任为该校校长。一九三九年陕公、鲁艺、青训班及工人学校合并成为华北联合大学，挺进敌后，成仿吾仍为校长。一九四八年华北联大复兴北方大学合并为今日的华北大学，他继任副校长。十多年来，在他的培植和教育下，已有数万青年涌向革命的岗位，他愉快地向记者说：“从陕公到华大出来的同学们，已布满了全国各地，其中尤以华北地区为最多”。
    成仿吾并以亲身的经历描述了人民教育事业成长的情形，他说：“抗战开始后，人民教育便更加发展起来了，广大的知识青年为爱国心所驱使，纷纷跑到抗日的民主圣地——延安来，中国共产党为适应新的形势，便先后成立各种干部学校，对他们进行革命的政治教育。但因各方面对干部的迫切需要，大部只经过一两个月甚至两三星期的学习，就分发到工作岗位上去了。以后，抗日根据地日渐扩大，干部学校与训练班更加需要，各解放区都先后成立了许多的教育单位，如以后的华北联大、北方大学；同时解放区的普通教育机构如小学、中学、师范等也普遍设立，详细的数目字没有，但可以断言，抗日时期，解放区的学校教育大大地超过了国民党统治时代。我们还有各种形式的社会教育，如民众夜校、成人识字班、工人学校、妇女识字班以及各地盛行的冬学等，对于扫除文盲，提高群众政治水平均有显著成绩。这是人民教育事业的一大特点。其次我们的教育是为广大人民服务的，因此它实行理论与实践一致的教学，学校是根据需要才设立的，学生们的学习随时都要联系着实际来进行，而学习得来的东西又随时拿到实际中间去运用。所以学生们学完之后，一定能有工作，并能担负一定的工作。
    十多年来，解放区的各级学校培养了不下几十万干部，对抗日战争和今天正在进行的人民革命战争都起了很大作用。成仿吾谈到这里着重地说：“这一伟大成绩的获得，首先是中共中央的争取，团结、教育，改造知识分子的政策的正确，还有无数教育工作者牺牲奋斗的结果。
    最后，记者问到新中国的教育前途，成仿吾乐观地说：“毛主席在人民政协的开幕词中，已清楚地告诉我们：‘随着经济建设高潮的到来，不可避免地将要出现一个文化建设的高潮。’我们的教育工作者要充分领会这一句话的意义，要准备好一切来迎接这一高潮。我们教育工作的前途是十分光明远大的。我们应该加紧工作，努力学习，肩负起这一伟大而艰巨的任务！”
    成仿吾复进一步指出：今天战争尚未结束，在经济困难的情形下，目前的中心工作首先是旧有学校的改造，教学制度、课程内容及教学方法等均应有步骤地去掉反人民的、反动的毒素，而使之符合新民主主义的精神。教育界的同仁则必须明确树立为人民而办教育的思想，逐渐做到根本改变我们教育工作的思想内容，这是教育改革的中心环节。
