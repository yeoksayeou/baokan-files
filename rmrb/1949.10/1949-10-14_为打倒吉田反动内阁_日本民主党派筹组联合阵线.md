　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 13th: TASS, Pyongyang, 10th: According to news from Tokyo, a meeting was recently held in Tokyo to discuss the organization of a united front to fight to overthrow the Yoshida Cabinet. Present at the meeting were Nosaka Sanzo and Ito Ritsu of the Japanese Communist Party, Hori Makoto and Suzuki Masaji of the Labor-Farmer Party, and Kobashi Umeichi and Morioka Eiji of the Left-Wing Socialist Party. The meeting resolved to establish a Liaison Committee for the Joint Struggle of Democratic Parties and urged all democratic parties to participate in the committee. The participation of Left-Wing Socialists in the joint struggle to overthrow the reactionary Yoshida Cabinet is a major blow to the divisive conspiracy of the right-wing leadership of the Socialist Party. Therefore, the Socialist Party's right-wing immediately took measures to deal with the Kobashi faction. It is pointed out that the Socialist Party's right-wing leadership will try to expel the Kobashi faction from the party. However, the Kobashi faction, regardless of the suppression of the Socialist Party's right-wing leaders, still insists on its position of participating in the Liaison Committee for the Democratic Parties' Struggle to Overthrow the Yoshida Cabinet.

　　为打倒吉田反动内阁
    日本民主党派筹组联合阵线
    【新华社北京十三日电】塔斯社平壤十日讯：据来自东京的消息，东京最近举行了讨论组织为打倒吉田内阁而斗争的联合阵线的会议。参加会议的有日本共产党的野坂参三和伊藤律，工农党的掘诚和铃木正治、左翼社会党的小桥梅一和森冈荣治。会议议决成立民主党派联合斗争联络委员会，并敦促各民主党派参加该委员会。左翼社会党人参加打倒吉田反动内阁的联合斗争，是对社会党右翼领导当局分裂阴谋的重大打击。因此，社会党右翼就立即采取措施来对付小桥派。人们指出，社会党右翼领导当局将设法把小桥派开除出党。但小桥派不顾社会党右翼领袖的压制，仍然坚持其参加民主党派打倒吉田内阁斗争联络委员会的立场。
