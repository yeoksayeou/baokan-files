　　Looking at American Farmers from Statistics and Reality
    By Laibofu, abridged translation by Zhang Xinmai

    "U.S. News & World Report," notorious for glorifying war, has recently begun to praise the happy and carefree life of American farmers in lyrical tones.

    The author of this great work tirelessly insists that his chosen protagonist is not an exception: there are thousands just like him in the American Garden of Eden. Every autumn, this "ordinary farmer"—owner of six hundred acres of land—can sell his wheat for $11,500, fourteen bulls for $2,160, and with other produce, he can earn $16,000. After deducting $5,000 in expenses, he is left with $11,000, which allows him to live a very happy life.

    It also includes a beautiful photo: the farmer is smiling broadly, with a neat and lovely wife beside him. Moreover, the account books are also photographed to show "truthfulness and honesty." In fact, this is superfluous; such people do exist in America.

    The only trouble is that this "typical farmer" with five hundred to seven hundred acres is not common in America: they make up only 1.8 percent of the total. Fifty-one percent of American farmers can only earn one-fourteenth of the income of this smiling farmer.

    As the inevitable economic crisis that bankrupts tens of millions of farmers looms closer, the U.S. government's propaganda about rural "prosperity" becomes more clamorous. Speeches by government officials, papers by "court" economists, and official statistics are constantly disseminating this propaganda.

    However, it is impossible to hide the adversity faced by the vast majority of American farmers. Many American books depict their miserable living conditions: poor food, no money for medical treatment when sick, children unable to attend school, extremely poor housing, and other countless hardships destined for them.

    The value of these books is certainly not equal. In addition to works that truly expose the true causes of farmers' poverty under the shackles of monopoly capital, there are also conclusions researched by liberals of various colors. These people are not unwilling, but unable, to analyze the causes. However, simply presenting the facts in this regard is much more eloquent than empty rhetoric.

    What rebuttals can those eulogists of the "American way of life" offer to the cold reality? None, except lies. They believe that although lying cannot completely obscure the facts, it can at least apply a thick coat of paint to them.

    Hypocritical American propaganda always seizes on some "average numbers"; however, anyone knows that average numbers calculated from extremely disparate property groups are obviously incorrect. In the case of the United States, the disparity between the rich and the poor can be said to be one at the South Pole and one at the North Pole. The average number derived from such extreme disparity is nothing but sheer fabrication.

    A 1945 U.S. agricultural survey indicated that 51 percent of farms sold a total of $1.2 billion in agricultural products; on the other hand, 4.9 percent of farms earned $6.4 billion, of which 0.5 percent of farms earned $2.15 billion, and 0.1 percent of farms earned $1 billion. This shows that the income of large agricultural enterprises accounting for only 0.5 percent of all farms exceeds the average income of more than half of the farms by 215 times, while the income of 0.1 percent of farms exceeds the average income by 510 times.

    Agricultural capitalist Sal Campo's farm has 350 agricultural machines (including 50 high-speed tractors), a cottonseed oil factory, a feed factory, and 40,000 head of livestock, with an annual income of $8 million; however, there are three million farms with an average annual income of only $400. Little more than a dollar a day, and after deducting taxes and expenses—this is the income situation of half of American farm families. The above figures not only prove the terrible disparity between the income level of the majority of farmers and the annual income of a very small number of supreme large agricultural capitalists, but also indicate how large a proportion of the total income of farmers is seized by a small number of capitalists!

    However, even so, American statistics still distort this so-called "average income."

    In order to inflate the absurd index, the investigation of the number of poor farm families is ignored. The 1945 survey did not include farms with less than three acres or an annual income of less than $250. As a result, a large number of farms were not included in the official statistics. If these farms were also included in the calculation of the average, it is clear that this fabricated official statistic is already a privately altered number.

    This is the truth about the mysterious "average" income of American farmers. It conceals the fact that a small group of capitalist agricultural entrepreneurs are becoming extraordinarily richer every day, while the real income of the vast majority of farmers continues to decline.

    More than once, several famous servants of the U.S. government inadvertently exposed the hypocritical and deceptive traditional arguments. Obviously, these servants have not yet learned enough about the art of deceiving and lying in the American officialdom. For example, John Heereman, an official of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, once published an article in the department's official newspaper "Agricultural Situation." Heereman said: "Our agriculture is indeed underdeveloped. All the average numbers are very high, but these numbers do not tell us the actual situation of work and life of the vast majority of farmers."

    The surplus from the sale of products from most farms is very low. This problem is dealt with in American official statistics.

    According to the 1945 survey: 51 percent of farms only supply 7 percent of total products sold; one-fourteenth of the farms supply 39 percent, while one-thousandth of the farms supply 6.1 percent, which is about the same as that supplied by half of American farms.

    Another point worth remembering: American farmers do not grind their own flour; except for feed and seeds, they sell all their wheat and then buy the bread they need. In this way, the surplus that more than half of the farms can obtain from the sale of products is greatly exaggerated, and as a result, the index of surplus that can be obtained from the sale of products in American agricultural statistics is as unreliable as the average income mentioned above.

    Strangely enough, even the rise in agricultural product prices makes small farms poorer. Because when agricultural product prices rise, other items also rise, and rise even faster. During the period from June 1946 to August 1948, agricultural product prices rose by 30 percent, while farmers' necessities rose by 50 percent. On the other hand, during periods of depression, agricultural product prices often fall much faster than other farmers' necessities. Between August and September last year, the agricultural product price index fell by 11.3 percent, while the prices farmers had to pay remained unchanged.

    In this way, falling prices are also harmful to small and medium-sized farms.

    Furthermore, it must be pointed out that rich farmers can wait until agricultural product prices are high to sell their grain, while small farmers have to sell their grain at low prices immediately after the harvest. The statistical numbers calculated from this situation are also inconsistent with the facts.

    The U.S. government's "agricultural maintenance fees," including agricultural loans, are also of no benefit to small farmers. Schultz revealed this "secret" in his book "Agriculture in an Unstable Economy." He pointed out: "Farmers with large incomes receive more agricultural loans from the government than farmers with small incomes."

    Here, the average numbers again cover up the differences between different farm groups.

    Monopoly capital not only exploits farmers in the prices of agricultural products, but also plunders farmers through various other means. For example, small farmers' agricultural machines are very poor, and the annual repair costs account for 45 percent of the value of the machines.

    This is the truth about American official statistics that use "average numbers" as a cover. The so-called "American way of life" and the "prosperity" of American farmers are fabricated based on these "average numbers," which have nothing to do with the facts.

### 从统计数字及实际情形看美国农民

　　从统计数字及实际情形看美国农民
    莱波夫作  张心迈节译
    以歌颂战争而臭名昭著的“美国新闻和世界报导”近来居然用抒情诗的句调赞美起美国农民的快乐无忧的生活来了。
    这篇大作的作者毫不惮厌地坚称他所选择的主人翁不是什么例外：美国伊甸乐园中有成千成万跟他一样的人。每到秋天，这种“普通农民”——六百英亩土地的所有者——所打的小麦能卖一万一千五百美元，十四头公牛能卖二千一百六十美元，再加上其他的生产品，他能收入一万六千美元，除去五千美元的开销，尽余一万一千美元，于是他可以很快活地过日子。
    它还附有一张美观的照片：农民笑得合不住嘴，旁边有位整洁可爱的太太。并且，帐簿也给照了进去以表示“真实无欺”。其实，这也多余；这样的人美国的确存在。
    唯一的麻烦是拥有五百英亩到七百英亩的这种“典型农民”在美国并不多：总共不过百分之一点八。百分之五十一的美国农民只能有这位含笑农民收入的十四分之一。
    使千万农民破产的不可避免的经济危机愈来愈近时，美国官方吹嘘农村“繁荣”的宣传就喧嚣得愈凶。政府官员的演说，“御用”经济学者的论文，官方的统计随时都在散布这种宣传。
    然而，要想隐藏绝大多数美国农民所遭遇的逆境是不可能的。美国好些书中都描绘了他们悲惨的生活情形：粗劣的食物，生病无钱就医，小孩无法入学，房屋极坏以及其他命中注定的不可胜数的艰难困苦。
    这些书的价值当然不会相等。除了真能暴露在垄断资本束缚下农民穷困的真正原因的著作外，还有各种不同色彩的自由主义者所研究出来的结论。这些人并不是不愿，而是不能，把原因分析出来。然而只要把这方面的事实摆出来就比空言雄辩得多。
    那些“美国生活方式”的讴歌者能对冷酷的现实提出什么辩驳呢？不能，除了撒谎以外。他们以为撒谎虽然不能把事实完全朦蔽起来，但至少可以给事实刷上一件厚厚的漆。
    虚伪的美国宣传老是抓着一些“平均数字”；但是，任何人都知道，从差异极大的财产集团中计算出来的平均数字显然是不正确的。就美国的情形来说，贫富的悬殊可以说是一个在南极，一个在北极，由这种极端悬殊的情况中求出来的平均数只不过是不折不扣的虚构而已。
    一九四五年美国农业调查指出：百分之五十一的农场出卖农产品的收入共十二亿美元；另一方面，百分的四点九的农场收入六十四亿美元，其中百分之零点五的农场收入二十一亿五千万美元，百分之零点一的农场收入十亿美元。这说明了：占所有农场中仅百分之零点五的大农业企业的收入超过半数以上农场的平均收入达二百一十五倍，而百分之零点一的农场的收入则超过了平均收入的五百一十倍。
    农业资本家萨尔·坎浦的一个农场有三百五十台农业机器（包括五十台高速拖拉机），一个棉油厂，一个饲料工厂和四万头牲口，每年收入达八百万美元；然而，却有三百万农场每年的平均收入仅只四百美元。每天一块多美元，而且还要扣去捐税及开销——这便是美国半数农家的收入情形。　上面的数字不仅证明了大多数农民的收入水平与极少数至高无上的大农业资本家的岁入中的可怕的悬殊，同时也指出了少数的资本家所攫有的农民总收入是何等大！
    然而，即令如此，美国统计还要把这种所谓“平均收入”歪曲一番。
    为了提高无稽的指数，贫苦农家的数目的调查被忽视了。一九四五年的调查便没有把三英亩以下或每年收入不及二百五十美元的农场计入。结果，一个很大数目的农场没有列入官方的统计。如果这些农场也加入平均数的计算，显然地这个虚构的官方统计已经是一个私行改窜过的数字了。
    这就是关于美国农民玄妙的“平均”收入的真相。它隐匿了一小群资本主义农业企业家的天天更富得非凡，而绝大部分农民的真正收入在继续减退的事实。
    不止一次，美国政府几位著名的奴仆无意中揭穿了虚伪的欺骗老百姓的传统说法。显然，这些奴仆对于美国官场中的好欺善谎还学习得不够。譬如，美国农业部官员约翰·海尔门曾在该部机关报“农业近况”上发表过一篇文章，海尔门说：“我们的农业的确不发达。所有的平均数字都很高，但这些数字却没有告诉我们绝大部分农民工作和生活的实际情况。”
    大部分农场从出卖生产品所得的盈余非常低。美国官方统计中却把此问题对付过去。
    根据一九四五年的调查：百分之五十一的农场仅供应出售总产品的百分之七；十四分之一的农场供应百分之三十九，而千分之一的农埸则供应出百分之六点一，那就是说，与半数美国农场所供应的差不多。
    还有一点值得记住：美国农民不自己磨面；除了饲料和种子以外，他们把所有的小麦卖掉，然后买进所需要的面包。这样，半数以上的农场的从出售生产品所能得的盈余是被大大地夸大了，而结果使得美国农业统计中的从出售生产品所能得的盈余之指数与上面所说的平均收入一样不可靠。
    说也奇怪，即令是农产品涨价，也使得小农场越来越穷。因为，农产品涨价，别的物品也涨，而且涨得更快。一九四六年六月至一九四八年八月这一段期间内，农产品涨了百分之三十，而农民必需品却涨了百分之五十。另一方面，不景气期间内农产品落价也往往比其他农民必需品快得多。去年八九月间，农产品物价指数落了百分之十一点三而农民必须付出的物价却保持未变。
    这样，物价下落也对中小农有害。
    复次，必须指出：富农能等待到农产品价格高的时候把粮食卖出，而小农却不得不在收获后马上就把粮食低价出售。由这种情形计算出来的统计数又是与事实不符的。
    美国政府包括农贷在内的“农业维持费”也是与小农无益的。萧而兹曾在“不安定经济中的农业”书中透露了这个“秘密”。他指出：“收入大的农民从政府获得的农贷比收入小的农民要多。”
    这里，平均数字又遮盖了不同的农场集团间的差别。
    独占资本不独在农产品的价格上剥削农民，而且还凭借其他各种不同的方式来掠夺农民。譬如小农的农业机器都很差，每年的修理费达机器值价的百分之四十五。
    这就是利用“平均数字”作掩护的美国官方统计的真象。所谓“美国生活方式”及美国农民的“繁荣”就是靠这些“平均数字”捏造出来的，它与事实完全无关。
