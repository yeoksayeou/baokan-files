Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 1st: Polish News Agency dispatch, the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs delivered a note to the Yugoslav government embassy in Warsaw on the 30th, stating: It is an indisputable fact that certain representatives of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia, such as Milic, are engaged in espionage activities. Furthermore, political provocation and sabotage actions, carried out under the orders of the Yugoslav government, which are hostile to the Polish people and nation and coincide with fascist underground activities, also prove that the government is completely linked to the imperialist camp. Therefore, the Polish government is compelled to declare that the Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance, and Post-war Cooperation between the Polish government and the government of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia, signed on March 18, 1946, has been undermined and nullified by the government of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia, disregarding the sentiments of the Yugoslav and Polish peoples. The interrogation of Rajk and his accomplices proves that, due to the Yugoslav government's role as a tool of the imperialist bloc and its utter submissiveness and servility, the Yugoslav government's hypocritical and hostile policy towards the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries is linked to the organization of counter-revolutionary conspiracies against the independence and sovereignty of the people's democratic countries. In view of this, the Polish government declares that it will no longer be bound by the treaty of March 18, 1946.
　　In addition, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs possesses evidence indicating that the aforementioned espionage and provocation activities were carried out under the direction of the Yugoslav Embassy in Warsaw, particularly through its military attache, commercial counselor, and press counselor.
　　Therefore, the Polish government emphatically demands that the Yugoslav Embassy in Warsaw cease its activities of importance to Poland and demands that the following personnel of the embassy immediately leave Polish territory: Counselor of the Embassy Rukavin, Military Attache Lieutenant Colonel Susuba, Assistant Military Attaches Major Bokic and Captain Božić, Kötel, Commercial Counselor Malavić, Assistant Commercial Counselor Lukić, and Press Counselor Šipčić.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 1st: TASS dispatch from Budapest: On September 30th, Hungarian Foreign Minister Károly Kiss received the Yugoslav Minister to Budapest, Juro Jovanović, and delivered a note on behalf of the government of the Hungarian People's Republic. The note stated: In view of the hostile activities of the current leaders of Yugoslavia towards Hungary, the government of the Hungarian People's Republic believes that henceforth it will not be bound by the obligations undertaken by the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 1st: TASS dispatch from Moscow: The Hungarian trade delegation arrived in Moscow on September 28th. The delegation includes Gábor Cilly, Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade of Hungary.

　　波匈两国分别照会南政府
    废除与南互助条约
    并驱逐铁托集团间谍分子出境
    【新华社北京一日电】波兰通讯社讯，波兰外交部三十日以照会一件递交南斯拉夫政府驻华沙大使馆，内称：南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国某些代表如米利奇之流从事间谍活动是无可争辩的事实，此外在南斯拉夫政府命令下正在进行着敌视波兰人民与国家并与法西斯地下活动相吻合的政治挑拨破坏行动，也证明了该政府与帝国主义阵营完全联系在一起。因此，波兰政府不得不声明：波兰政府与南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国政府于一九四六年三月十八日所缔订的友好互助条约，已被南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国政府不顾南斯拉夫人民与波兰人民的情感而加以摧残和化为乌有。对拉伊克及其同谋者的审讯证明，由于南斯拉夫政府充当帝国主义集团的工具，对它完全驯服与奴颜婢膝的行为，南斯拉夫政府对苏联及人民民主国家的伪善与敌视政策便与为了反对人民民主国家独立与主权的反革命阴谋之组织连系着。有鉴于此，波兰政府声明：本政府此后即不受一九四六年三月十八日条约的约束。
    此外，本外交部握有证据，说明上述间谍与挑拨破坏活动是在南斯拉夫驻华沙大使馆的主使下进行的。特别是经其武官、商务参赞与新闻参赞处进行的。
    因此，波兰政府着重要求南斯拉夫驻华河大使馆停止其重视波兰的活动，并要求该大使馆下列人员立即离开波兰国境：大使馆参事鲁卡文、武官苏苏巴中校、助理武官鲍基奇少校、鲍齐奇上尉、科捷尔、商务参赞马拉维奇、助理商务参赞鲁基奇与新闻参赞西普利奇。
    【新华社北京一日电】塔斯社布达佩斯讯：九月三十日，匈牙利外交部长卡拉伊接见南斯拉夫驻布达佩斯公使尤罗·约发诺维奇，并代表匈牙利人民共和国政府递交照会一件。照会声称：鉴于南斯拉夫现时领袖对匈牙利的敌对活动，匈牙利人民共和国政府认为今后它将不受由友好合作与互助条约而承担的义务的约束。
    【新华社北京一日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：匈牙利贸易代表团于九月二十八日抵莫斯科。代表团中有匈牙利对外贸易部次长加利。
