　　The Growth of a Village Theater Troupe
　　Li Ping
　　The theater troupe in Bocun Village, Shulu County, Hebei Province, was established in 1944. At that time, they borrowed cloth sheds from the east and door curtains from the west to put on a show, having nothing of their own. But now they have colorful curtains of red, yellow, blue, gray, and other colors; gongs, drums, qin, flutes, and makeup are all complete. However, the purchase of these things was not an expense for the village, but created by the hands of the theater troupe members. During the "Anti-Black Land" struggle, the eight acres of bad land that the masses were unwilling to take at the time were given to the village theater troupe, and they happily treated it as their family business. Usually, when people go to take a nap and cool off, they gather and go to the fields. After planting for two years in this way, they earned this fortune for the troupe. Actors Li Zaoshen, Li Xiangsheng, and others who knew carpentry, used their time off to piece together some substandard wood, cutting and fitting it to make doors, windows and other scenery equipment. Everyone admired the beautiful sound of the violin, so Li Xiangsheng measured the violin's dimensions and, after half a month of research, finally made one. It was bright red in color, with four shiny steel strings, and sounded just like a bought one when played. Troupe members Hu Qinshao and others found bamboo tubes and snakeskin, and made four ergu zi and one piqin. Feeling that the troupe didn't have a suitable place, they took the village's five dilapidated rooms that had been used to feed livestock and had leaky roofs. When it rained this autumn and they couldn't work in the fields, everyone pitched in and cleaned them up in two days. This is now the location of the theater troupe. A beautiful family business was created by these male and female farmers.

　　In 1944, the Japanese invaders still ruled this area. Enemy strongholds were within eight li of the village, and watchtowers dotted the landscape. But these people, unwilling to be oppressed, organized a theater troupe under the leadership of the Communist Party. Many of the actors were also members of the guerrilla group. They rehearsed plays at night and fought when the enemy came. They often cooperated with the guerrilla group and district cadres to penetrate the enemy's heart, launch political offensives, and perform many times, exposing the enemy's conspiracies, educating enemy and puppet personnel, inspiring the masses' fighting spirit, and strengthening their confidence in victory. Later, during the land reform, the army conscription movement, and the great production movement, they performed at every stage of work and achieved considerable results. For example, after performing "Big Mouth Goes Home" (a play against desertion) for the Fourth Column's supplementary training regiment, the unit leader wrote a letter saying: "You performed so well that the soldiers all said that deserting is really shameful and they can't desert." This year, to support the flood-stricken areas with a bowl of rice campaign, they organized a yangko dance team to promote it in the streets, and raised more than 400 kilograms of grain that day. The village theater troupe has become a powerful pillar in promoting the work of the village.

　　The main reason they have been able to collectively rehearse and study almost every night for the past five years is that they actively participate in production, earning the love and support of their parents and the masses. Li Cangyin, an eighteen-year-old girl, used to be poor. She only received a few mu of land when it was divided, and her family of five mainly relied on her weaving to make a living. Every night after returning from the theater troupe, she still had to spin or weave. This year, she used the cloth she wove to buy a donkey with others and dug a well together. During the autumn harvest, she also took the time to harvest rice and pick cotton for others. Li Jinfu, the captain of the drama troupe, has a family of seven and cultivates twenty mu of land. He goes to the fields before dawn every day, not even caring to go home for meals. Because of his hard work, the four and a half mu of cotton he planted this year yielded 190 jin per mu. When it rained in the autumn and he couldn't work in the fields, he quickly gathered fifteen or sixteen cartloads of green manure. In short, everyone in the theater troupe works hard in this way, so no one says that these are not good girls and good young men, experts at managing a household. At the same time, learning has become a habit for them, and they feel uncomfortable if they don't go for a day. The learning courses are decided by everyone through discussion, including literacy, reading the newspaper, abacus calculation, rehearsing plays, learning lyrics, and musical scores. Whoever knows something teaches it, and whoever doesn't know something learns it. Everyone is both a teacher and a student. Of the twenty-nine people who are illiterate or have only attended one or two years of elementary school, four can now fully understand the script, and sixteen can understand more than half of it. The fifteen people who have attended four years of elementary school can all read scripts, newspapers, and explain the news; four have learned to read musical scores, and eight have learned to add, subtract, multiply, and divide with the abacus. Except for nine old people who are illiterate, there are no young people who are illiterate. Also, due to frequent education on unity and mutual assistance, the internal atmosphere of the theater troupe is one of unity and mutual assistance. For example, when actor Li Xiaozhou was ill and had financial difficulties, the theater troupe automatically launched an internal donation to help him. Actor Li Zhenmiao had a hard life, and everyone contributed 1.6 dan of wheat to lend him for production. In normal production, small-scale temporary mutual assistance is also adopted. Their unity is not one of harmony without principle, but they have a review meeting every week to continuously improve themselves. When the theater troupe was first established, it expelled three members with improper work styles, and has always maintained the purity and consolidation of the organization. Due to gradual improvement, thirteen actors have been promoted to cadres who are detached from production, and eleven have been promoted to village cadres.

　　The peasants' urgent need for cultural entertainment after liberation is one of the reasons for the theater troupe's consolidation and expansion. The older generation believes that it is an honor for their children to go to the theater troupe. Li Laopeng, who is over fifty years old, goes to the theater troupe to sing every day, and every night people surround them to watch them rehearse. It can also be seen from the development of the theater troupe that thirteen of the nineteen female actors were newly added last year and this year, now totaling forty-eight people.

　　The village theater troupe has become the entertainment place for the masses of the whole village, and also a school. They use the voice of the people to recover from the fatigue of the day and pursue progress. October 15, 1949.

　　一个村剧团的成长
    李萍
    河北束鹿县伯村的一个剧团是在一九四四年成立的。那时演个戏，东借布棚，西借门帘，什么也没有。但现在他们已有了红、黄、蓝、灰等各色鲜艳的幕布；锣鼓、琴、笛、以及化装用品样样俱全了。不过购置这些东西，并不是村里开支，而是剧团团员们的双手创造出来的。“反黑地”斗争时，群众当时不愿要的八亩坏地，给了村剧团，他们欢喜地把它当成家业。平时，人们都去歇晌，乘凉了，他们却集合起来下了地。这样种了二年，便给剧团挣下了这份家当。演员李造深、李祥生等四人会木匠活，利用歇晌时把些不成材的木料，东凑西裁的作成了门窗等布景设备。大伙羡慕提琴声音好听，李祥生把提琴的尺寸作了衡量，经过了半个月时间的研究，终于作成了，鲜红的颜色，系着四根光亮的钢丝弦，拉起来和买的一样。团员胡琴少等人找了竹筒和蛇皮，作成了四个二股子一个瓢琴。大家感觉剧团没个合适地方，就把村中几间喂过牲口、房顶露天的五间破房，在今秋下雨不能下地的时候，大家齐动手，两天就收拾好了。这就是现在剧团的所在地。一个美丽的家业，就在这些男女庄稼汉的手下创立起来了。
    一九四四年，日寇还统治着这块地方，村周八里远都是敌据点，岗楼林立，但这些不甘受压迫的人们，在共产党的领导下，组织起了剧团，同时有不少演员又是游击组员，晚上排剧，敌人来了就打，并常和游击组、区干部配合着，深入敌人心脏，开展政治攻势，作了不少次演出，揭穿敌人阴谋，教育敌伪人员，启发群众斗争情绪，坚定胜利信心。后来，土地改革，参军运动，大生产运动，每个工作阶段都作过演出，而收到不小效果，如给四纵队补训兵团出演了“大嘴回家”（反对开小差的剧）以后，部队首长来信说：“你们演的真好，战士们都说开小差真丢人，可不能开小差。”今年开展一碗米运动支援水灾区，他们组织了秧歌队在街上宣传，当天就募集了四百多斤粮食。村剧团已成了村中推动工作的一个有力的支柱。
    他们所以能够在这五年来，几乎每天晚上都集体排剧、学习，主要是他们积极的参加生产，博得了家长和群众的爱戴与拥护。十八岁的闺女李藏印，早先家里穷，平分土地时才分下几亩地，一家五口人主要是靠她织布过活，她每天晚上从剧团回去，还要纺线或织布，今年用她织的布和别人伙买了一头驴，伙打了一眼井。大秋里她还抽空给人掏谷子，摘棉花。戏剧队长李进发，家里七口人种着二十亩地，每天都是天不亮就下了地，连吃饭都不顾的回家。由于他的勤劳，今年种的四亩半棉花，每亩能摘一百九十斤。秋天下雨不能下地，他抓紧压绿肥十五六车，总之剧团里的每个人，都是这样努力劳动，因此没有人不说这是些好闺女和好小伙子、过日子的能手。同时学习已成了他们的习惯，一天不去心里就不痛快。学习课程，是经大家讨论出来的，有识字、讲报、珠算、排剧、学剧词、谱，谁会什么就教什么，不会什么就学什么，谁也是先生也是学生。不识字和上过一二年小学的二十九人，已有四人能完全看懂剧本，十六人能看懂一半多。上过四年小学的十五人，都能看剧本、报纸和讲报；四人学会了识谱，八人学会了珠算的加减乘除法；除去九个老人不识字外，青年们已没有不识字的了。又由于经常进行团结互助的教育，所以剧团内部是一片团结互助景象。如演员李小周病时生活困难，剧团里自动发动了内部输捐，予以帮助，演员李振渺生活苦，大家凑了一石六斗麦子借予他搞生产。在平时的生产中，也采取了小型的临时互助。他们的团结并不是一团和气的，而是每礼拜有一次检讨会，不断的改进着自己。剧团开始成立时，曾把三个作风不正派的分子清洗出去，始终保持着组织的纯洁和巩固。由于逐步的提高，已有十三个演员被提拔为脱离生产的干部，十一人被提拔为村干部。
    翻身后的农民迫切的需要文化娱乐，这是剧团巩固和扩大的原因之一，老一辈的都认为自己的子女到剧团去是光荣，五十多岁的李老朋，天天到剧团里去唱，每晚上都有人围着看他们排练。从剧团的发展上也可看出来，十九个妇女演员，有十三个是去年和今年新添的，现共有四十八人了。
    村剧团已成了全村群众的娱乐场所，也是一座学校，他们以人民的声音来恢复一天的疲劳，追求着进步。一九四九、十月十五日。
