　　Another Lesson Learned
    Comrade Tu is welcomed by the young people because he can tell moving revolutionary stories. On Sunday evening, we sat around him, and after listening to a difficult, arduous, and thrilling story, we began to ask questions. I said, "What do rural primary school teachers do?" He retorted, "What are you planning to do in the future?" I said with self-satisfaction, "Teach music and dance!" Then he said with a smile, "You must humbly learn from the people first. I'm afraid the things you learn in the classroom are not what they need, or they may even know more than you do." What's going on? I have already learned teaching methods and teaching principles, why should I still learn from the people? So I asked again with confidence: "In the book 'Virgin Soil Upturned', there is a description of an old woman in the Soviet Union who would rather kill her beloved little yellow cow and suffer diarrhea from eating sunflower seeds than send it to the collective farm. Is this strong sense of private ownership even more prevalent among Chinese farmers?" The old man said solemnly: "You are asking this question too early. The Soviet Union has already abolished private property. China has just embarked on the construction of New Democracy. The central task in rural areas is still to develop production. A primary school teacher may be the only intellectual in a small village. He has many things to do, in addition to understanding the educational situation of children, he must also encourage production and carry out persuasive education work for farmers. In short, the material conditions in rural areas are currently not as good as in cities. Don't have beautiful illusions, but farmers are by no means completely ideologically backward. Experiencing the victory of the Chinese revolution today can make you realize the power of the farmers..."
    This immediately struck at the root of my ideological problem. It was precisely because I had illusions about the countryside and mechanically understood what Chairman Mao told us: "Intellectuals will accomplish nothing if they do not integrate with the workers and peasants." In order to "accomplish something," I intended to put on the airs of an intellectual and go to the workers and peasants to get "soiled" a bit to appear more "modern." I never thought about first "re-evaluating all values" for myself and honestly transforming myself. Today, Comrade Tu's words exposed my confused ideas, which counts as another lesson learned. This lesson is to tell me to humbly learn from the people and eliminate illusions, and to serve the people in a down-to-earth manner.

　　又上了一课
    涂老同志是被年青人们所欢迎的，因为他会讲动人的革命故事。星期日的晚上，我们围坐在他的身旁，听完了一段艰难困苦、惊心动魄的故事，我们开始提问题了，我说：“乡村的小学教师都干些什么呀！”他却反问了一句：“你将来打算做什么呢？”我沾沾自喜的说：“教音乐和舞蹈！”于是他微笑着说：“这一点你必须先向人民虚心的学习，恐怕你们在课堂里学的那一套不是他们所需要的，或者，他们所会的简直就比你们所学的多。”这是怎么回事呢？我已经学了教学法和教学原理，为什么还要向人民学习呢？所以我理直气壮的又问了：“在‘被开垦的处女地’一书中，描写苏联的一个老太婆，宁愿把心爱的小黄牛杀死，吃得到向日葵下拉稀去，也不愿意送到集体农场，这种浓厚的私有观念在中国农民中是更普遍吧？”老人郑重的说了：“你提这个问题太早了，苏联现在已经废除了私有财产，中国刚刚走上了新民主主义的建设，农村的中心工作还是发展生产。一个小学教师，可能是一个小村庄中的唯一知识分子，他的事情很多，除了掌握儿童们的教育情况，还要鼓励生产，对农民进行说服教育的工作。总之，农村的物质条件在目前是不如城市的，你不要存着美丽的幻想，但是农民也绝不是完全思想落后，体验一下中国革命今日的胜利，就可以认识农民的力量了……”
    这一下子说到我的思想病根上了，正是因为我对农村有着幻想，机械的了解到毛主席告诉我们的话：“知识分子如果不与工农群众相结合，则将一事无成。”为了要“成事”才打算端着知识分子的架子钻到工农中去，镀一下“土”显得“摩登”些，并没有想到对自己先来一个“重新估定一切价值”，老老实实地改造自己。今天涂老同志一句话点破了我的糊涂观念，算是又上了一课，这一课是叫我虚心地向人民学习并去掉幻想，踏踏实实的为人民服务。
