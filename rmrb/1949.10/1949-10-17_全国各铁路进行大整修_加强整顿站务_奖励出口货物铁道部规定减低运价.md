Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 16th. Strengthening railway passenger and freight transport to meet the needs of material exchange across regions in autumn and winter has become one of the central tasks of current railway work. In addition to carrying out major line repairs and overhauling the cold-proofing equipment of passenger cars, railways across the country are also rectifying station services in an effort to increase vehicle turnover rates. In late September, the Transportation Bureau of the Ministry of Railways convened a station services meeting for major stations of northern bureaus. The meeting reviewed and criticized the congestion of trains at Zhengzhou Station, the treatment of the Beijing-Shanghai express train as an ordinary train by stations along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, and the widespread lack of planning and punctuality among stations, resulting in common train delays. The meeting demanded that stations improve shunting operations and establish and improve the station responsibility system. The meeting stipulated that before December this year, the Tianjin, Jinan, Taiyuan, and Zhengzhou bureaus would gradually implement a joint labor and fixed shift system in station services. Currently, Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, and Xuzhou stations along the Longhai Railway have launched punctuality campaigns. Thanks to the efforts of employees, the freight efficiency of the Shanghai Railway Bureau has also been continuously enhanced. More than 500 freight cars have been repaired, and another 1,000 will be repaired by the end of this year. To meet the requirements of strengthening freight transport, the bureau plans to add freight yards, warehouses, cranes, and other equipment at Shanghai Station. The Beijing-Shanghai direct train has also begun to add two less-than-carload freight cars in late September to facilitate commercial transport. In addition, to promote the exchange of goods, the Ministry of Railways has recently made some adjustments to the freight rates for certain goods. To encourage the export of animal hair and Beijing's special handicrafts, the ministry has reduced the freight rates for these two types of goods. Since October 5th, the pricing for wool, camel hair, various animal hairs, and livestock down has been reduced from the fourth class to the tenth class. For wool with an export certificate issued by the provincial government or the Foreign Trade Bureau, the price will be halved based on the tenth class. The freight charges for eighteen kinds of Beijing-produced goods transported from Beijing to Tianjin, such as carpets, cloisonné ware, carved lacquerware, glassware, jade ware, embroidery, and ivory products, will be reduced by 40% of the original freight rate. This year, the country suffered from severe floods. To take care of farmers' lives and encourage fruit exports, the Ministry of Railways has reduced the parcel freight rates for pears, dates, and persimmons by 50% from October 15th. In addition, the freight rate for salted fish and dried fish has been changed from the sixth class to the tenth class, while the freight rate for silk and rayon has been raised from the fourteenth class to the eighth class.

　　全国各铁路进行大整修
  　加强整顿站务
    奖励出口货物铁道部规定减低运价
    【新华社北京十六日电】加强铁路客、货运输以适应秋冬各地物资交流的需要，已成为当前铁道工作中心之一。全国各铁路除正进行线路大补修和修整客车的防寒设备外，并正进行整顿站务，为提高车辆运转周率而努力。九月下旬，铁道部运输局曾召开了北方各局主要车站的站务会议。会上检查并批评了郑州车站列车堵塞，津浦路各站把京沪直达车视作普通列车，各站较普遍地存在着没有计划和缺乏行车正点观念，列车普遍误点等现象，要求各站改进运转调车作业，建立并健全站务负责制等。会议规定在今年十二月以前，天津、济南、太原、郑州各局依次逐步实行站务工作上的联合劳动和固定值班的制度。现陇海铁路的郑州、开封、徐州等站都已展开了行车正点运动。上海铁路局在员工努力下，货运效率亦已不断增强，现已修好的货车达五百余辆，今年年底将再修好一千辆。该路局并为适应加强货运的要求，拟在上海车站添建货站、仓库、起重机等设备。京沪直达列车，并已于九月下旬开始增挂零担货车两辆，以便利商运。此外，铁道部为促进货物的交流，对部分货物的运价，最近亦有若干调整。为奖励兽毛和北京特种手工艺品的出口，该部特将这两类货物的运价予以减低。自十月五日起，羊毛、驼毛、各种兽毛和家畜的绒毛等，一律由第四级减为第十级计价。羊毛经省级政府或对外贸易局给予出口证明者，更可按第十级减半收价。北京所产之地毯、景泰蓝器皿、雕漆、料器、玉器、刺绣品、象牙制品等十八种由京运津的运费，则按原运价减低百分之四十。今年全国水灾较重，铁道部为照顾农民生活，奖励水果出口，自十月十五日起，将梨、枣、柿子的包裹运价一律减低百分之五十。另咸鱼干鱼类的运价由第六级改为第十级；而生丝、人造丝等丝类运费则由十四级提高为第八级计价。
