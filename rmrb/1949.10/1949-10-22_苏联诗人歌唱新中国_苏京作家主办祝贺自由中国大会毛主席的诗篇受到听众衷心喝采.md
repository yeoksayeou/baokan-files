The hall was packed with Soviet intellectuals, workers from Moscow factories, and university and secondary school students. Every one of them praised the great victory of the Chinese people who established the People's Republic. Excellent Soviet poets recited their new poems dedicated to the Chinese people's struggle for freedom and happiness, the friendship between the Soviet and Chinese people, and their unremitting struggle for world peace. At that time, the venue erupted in stormy and lasting cheers.

　　Writer Gubatov said at the opening of the conference: No Soviet poet would not write for the Chinese people who have won the right to freedom and a happy life in arduous struggles. Gubatov said: Soviet writers, together with the people of the entire Soviet Union, extend warm respect and congratulations to the working people of China who have achieved a great victory.

The audience was extremely interested in the poems of the famous Chinese poet Xiao San, translated into Russian by Rom, and the poems of the Chinese people's leader Mao Zedong (who is an outstanding contemporary poet of China), translated into Russian by Pichi Mensky. Mao Zedong's inspiring poems, filled with firm confidence in the bright future of the Chinese people, received heartfelt applause.
