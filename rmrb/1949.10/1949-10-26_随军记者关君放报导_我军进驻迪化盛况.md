Xinhua News Agency, Dihua, October 24th. Correspondent Guan Junfang reports on the grand occasion of the People's Liberation Army's entry into Dihua, stating: At 3 PM on October 20th, the military flag of the People's Liberation Army was raised for the first time over Dihua. When the vanguard tank unit of the People's Liberation Army's majestic column reached Jijicaozi, 16 kilometers from the city, the crowd of representatives from all sectors and organs of Dihua, who had come from afar to welcome the People's Liberation Army, immediately burst into cheers of "Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!" Bawerhan, Chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government, and others stepped forward to warmly shake hands with Hu Jian, the regimental commander of the tank regiment. Many representatives excitedly lifted Commander Hu Jian high and shouted, "Long live the People's Liberation Army!"

　　Fourteen kilometers from Dihua, Kazakh compatriots who had traveled hundreds of miles on horseback stood on both sides of the road, waving the five-star national flag of the People's Republic of China to salute the People's Liberation Army. When the tanks advanced to Ulabai, eight kilometers from the city, tens of thousands of compatriots of all ethnic groups welcoming the People's Liberation Army, including workers, students, and citizens from all walks of life, erupted in a storm of cheers. After the female students of Dihua City presented flowers to the tank unit, the tanks slowly continued to advance. The Yangko team disguised by students of Xinjiang College, the stilt teams of various organs and groups, and the Uighur song and dance team then danced to the sound of marching music. As the tanks slowly passed through the sea of people shouting "Long live the People's Liberation Army!" and "Long live Chairman Mao!", people of all ethnic groups, men, women, old, and young, scrambled to climb onto the tanks and shake hands intimately with the soldiers. Many soldiers waved and cheered to the crowd using "Yakshima" (Uighur for "hello"), which they had just learned in Hami. The Uighur people who climbed onto the tanks happily patted their chests and gave a thumbs up, saying, "Our army." One Uighur compatriot said emotionally to the soldiers, "The Uighurs have turned over today along with other ethnic groups in the country. You are the army of all ethnic groups. We all unanimously support you." On the way to Dihua, one pine and cypress archway after another appeared, and each archway had a reception station, where female students in charge of the reception enthusiastically sent basket after basket of various fruits to the tanks. At the first archway, military music played the new national anthem. After Commander Hu Jian delivered a brief thank-you speech, Chairman Bawerhan delivered a speech in Uighur. Along the eight-kilometer road from Ulabai to Dihua, there were crowds of people from all ethnic groups welcoming the People's Liberation Army, cheering excitedly in the early winter wind and sand to their liberators. Countless five-star national flags fluttered in the wind, forming a magnificent scene of the people's great victory and the people's great unity, unprecedented in the history of the frontier.

　　The streets of Dihua City were even more deserted. The roofs on both sides of the street were also full of people. Every household hung the five-star national flag high, and slogans welcoming the People's Liberation Army were posted everywhere on the streets. The feelings between the people of all ethnic groups and the People's Liberation Army soldiers were completely exchanged. The People's Liberation Army brought unlimited happiness and laughter to the 80,000 citizens of Dihua.

    我军进驻迪化盛况
    【新华社迪化二十四日电】随军记者关君放报道人民解放军进驻迪化时的盛况称：十月二十日下午三时，人民解放军军旗首次飘扬在迪化城头。解放军先头战车部队的雄壮行列到达距城十六公里的芨芨槽子时，远道出城欢迎人民解放军的迪化市各界和各机关代表的人群中立即响起了“毛泽东主席万岁！”的欢呼声。新疆省临时人民政府主席鲍尔汉等趋前与战车团胡鉴团长热烈握手。许多代表们兴奋地把胡鉴团长高高地举了起来，高呼“人民解放军万岁！”
    距迪化城十四公里处，从百里路外赶来的哈萨克族同胞乘着高头大马，伫立在公路两旁，挥舞着中华人民共和国的五星国旗，向人民解放军致敬。当战车进至距城八公里的乌拉拜时，数以万计的迎接人民解放军的各民族同胞，包括工人、学生及各阶层市民，发出一阵阵暴风雨似的欢呼声。迪化市女学生向战车部队献花后，战车徐徐地继续向前开进。新疆学院学生们化装的秧歌队、各机关团体的高跷队和维族歌舞队，随即在进军的音乐声中舞蹈起来。战车徐徐地在欢呼“人民解放军万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”的人海中通过时，各民族人民男女老少都争相爬上战车，和战士们亲密地握手。许多战士用刚在哈密学会的“亚克西玛”（维族话问好）向人群挥手欢呼。爬到战车上的维族人民都高兴地用手拍着胸膛，竖起大拇指说：“我们的军队。”有一个维族同胞感动地对战士们说：“维族今天和其他国内民族一同翻身了。你们是各民族的军队。我们都一致拥护你们。”在到迪化的路上，松柏彩楼一个接一个，每一个松柏彩楼处都设了招待站，负责招待的女学生们热情地把各种水果一筐筐地送上战车。在第一个彩楼处，军乐高奏新国歌。胡鉴团长致简短谢词后，鲍尔汉主席以维语致词，从乌拉拜到迪化八公里的路上，沿途到处都有成百上千的各民族欢迎解放军的人群，在初冬的风沙中兴奋地向自己的解放者欢呼。无数面的五星国族迎风招展。形成边疆历史上从所未有的一幅人民大胜利和人民大团结的壮观。
    迪化市区的街道上更是万人空巷。街道两旁的屋顶上也站满了人。家家户户高悬五星国旗，街头到处贴满欢迎人民解放军的标语。各族人民与人民战士之间的感情完全交流在一起了。人民解放军给迪化八万市民带来了无限的幸福和欢笑。
