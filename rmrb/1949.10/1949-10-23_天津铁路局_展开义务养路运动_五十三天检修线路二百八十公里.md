Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 22nd: Launching a mass voluntary track maintenance campaign is an important method for maintaining railways. The Tianjin Railway Bureau adopted this method, and from July 18th to September 10th, 118 stations completed 286 kilometers of track inspection work in 53 days. If this enormous task were done by track maintenance workers, it would require more than 7,000 workdays and an expenditure of more than 110,000 jin of millet in wages. The personnel participating in this voluntary track maintenance campaign were very broad, including railway employees (accounting for 65.6% of all employees of the Tianjin Bureau), employee family members, students from Fulun Primary School, students from North China University and the Military and Political University, and people living along the railway line, totaling 35,000 people. Liu Jianzhang, Deputy Director of the Tianjin Bureau, personally took the lead in participating in the inspection, which had a great impact on the employees. This voluntary track maintenance campaign not only improved the quality of the railway lines and ensured the safety of train operations, but also greatly enhanced the people's care for the railway along the line because they personally participated in the maintenance, making the relationship between railway employees and the local people closer. At the same time, the participation of white-collar staff also changed the relationship between employees. Those who never participated in labor in the past felt that physical labor was not easy after sifting ballast, thus changing their views on labor, changing their views on workers, and strengthening the unity among employees.

  　展开义务养路运动
  　五十三天检修线路二百八十公里
    【新华社北京二十二日电】开展群众性的义务养路运动是保养铁路的重要方法之一。天津铁路局采用这一方法，从七月十八日到九月十日，五十三天中一百一十八个车站完成了二百八十六公里的线路检修工作。这一巨大工作，如果用道班工人来做需要七千多个工，要开支十一万多斤小米的工资。这次参加义务养路工作的人员非常广泛，其中包括铁路员工（占天津局全体职工的百分之六十五点六）、职工家属、扶轮小学的学生、华北大学和军政大学的学生以及沿线人民，共达三万五千人。天津局刘建章副局长亲自带头参加检修，在职工中影响很大。这次义务养路运动不但提高了铁路线路质量，保证了行车的安全，并且沿线人民因为亲自参加养路，他们对铁路的爱护已大为加强，使铁路职工与当地人民之间的关系更趋密切。同时由于职员的参加，也改变了职工之间的关系，过去从不参加劳动的职员在筛道碴之后，感到体力劳动也很不容易，因而改变了对劳动的观点，转变了对工人的看法，加强了职工之间的团结。
