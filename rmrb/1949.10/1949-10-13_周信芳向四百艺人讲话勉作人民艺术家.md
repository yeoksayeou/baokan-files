    [Beijing News] The Beijing Performing Arts Study Class invited People's Political Consultative Conference representative Zhou Xinfang to give a report at 9:00 AM yesterday (the 12th). More than 400 students from the Performing Arts Study Class attended. Based on the spirit of the Literary and Art Workers Congress resolution and the Common Program of the CPPCC, Zhou Xinfang pointed out that the correct direction for future drama workers should be to "enlighten the people's political consciousness and encourage the people's enthusiasm for labor." He said: The Performing Arts Study Class is an excellent start, and we should seize the opportunity to study, and he encouraged the performers to start by transforming themselves and educating themselves, and then to transform old dramas and create new dramas, and become artists of the people.
