Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 9th. In addition to prominently publishing news and commentary on the founding of the People's Republic of China on the front pages of North Korean newspapers in recent days, the bulletin boards in front of various official newspaper offices in Pyongyang have continuously reported news in eye-catching red letters about the opening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the election results of the Central People's Government, and the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union and China and North Korea. Workers, students, and other citizens from all walks of life have become enthusiastic readers of these bulletin boards. The Korean Central Broadcasting Station broadcasts various news items about the establishment of the Chinese Central People's Government three times a day. People from all walks of life in North Korea are talking about the birth of the People's Republic of China with joy. Kim Hwan-pil, a worker at the East Pyongyang Grain Production Factory, said: "The birth of the People's Republic of China is not only a huge victory for the democratic forces of the world, but also a great encouragement to our struggle for peaceful reunification of all of Korea." Chemical factory worker Li Yuan-kuan said: "China is a large country with a population of 475 million. The establishment of the People's Republic of China is a strong guarantee for the people of the world to quickly embark on the road of democracy and peace." Lin Bing-ji, a student at Kim Il-sung University, said: "The establishment of the People's Republic of China has a great impact on the cause of peaceful reunification of Korea." Staff members of North Korean newspaper offices are now enthusiastically studying the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and the two organic laws of the People's Political Consultative Conference and the Central People's Government. They believe that these are important documents of great historical significance.

    钻研中国人民政协文献
    【新华社平壤九日电】北朝鲜各报连日来除了以第一版显著地位登载中华人民共和国成立的消息和评论外，平壤各机关报社门前的揭示牌都用醒目的大红字不断报道着中国人民政协开会、中央人民政府选举结果，以及中苏中朝建立外交关系等消息。工人学生等各界市民都成为这些揭示牌的热心读者。朝鲜中央广播电台每日三次广播着中国中央人民政府成立的各种消息。北朝鲜各阶层人民都以欢悦的心情谈论着中华人民共和国的诞生。东平壤谷产工厂的工友金宦弼说：“中华人民共和国的诞生不仅是全世界民主力量的巨大胜利，而且对于我们全朝鲜人民争取和平统一的斗争是一莫大鼓舞。”化学工厂工友李元宽说：“中国是四万万七千五百万人口的大国。中华人民共和国的成立是全世界人民迅速走上民主和平道路的坚强保证。”金日成大学的学生林炳基说：“中华人民共和国的成立，对朝鲜和平统一的事业给予很大的影响。”北朝鲜各机关报社的工作人员，现正热心研究中国人民政协共同纲领、人民政协与中央人民政府两个组织法。他们认为这是有着巨大历史意义的重要文献。
