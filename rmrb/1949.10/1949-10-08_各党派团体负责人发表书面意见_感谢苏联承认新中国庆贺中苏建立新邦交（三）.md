【Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper】 After the news of the Soviet government's first recognition of New China was published, leaders of various democratic parties and organizations issued written statements expressing their gratitude and warmly supporting the establishment of diplomatic relations and the exchange of ambassadors. The written opinions of the responsible persons of the China Democratic National Construction Association, China Zhi Gong Party, the September 3rd Society, Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and the All-China Democratic Youth Federation are published below:

At 15:00 on October 1, 1949, Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China announced the establishment of the People's Republic of China and the Central People's Government. At 21:45 on the 2nd, the Soviet Union's note recognizing the People's Republic of China was telegraphed to Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhou Enlai. Undoubtedly, the Soviet Union was the first friendly country to recognize the People's Republic of China. The arrival of the recognition telegram was only 30 hours and 45 minutes after the announcement of the establishment of our new Chinese government.

This is good news for New China, good news for China and the Soviet Union. No, this is good news for the people of East Asia, good news for the people of the world.

The Chinese people, after more than a hundred years of arduous struggle against imperialist economic aggressors and armed aggressors, and after decades of arduous struggle against feudalism, bureaucratic capitalism, and fascism, relied on the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the heroic fighting of the People's Liberation Army to win today's victory, the establishment of the People's Republic of China. After its establishment, the first thing to do is to establish diplomatic relations with all friendly countries in the world under the major principles of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for territorial sovereignty. The Soviet Union, which leads the world people's revolution, was the first to extend a hand, expressing friendship with us. This is similar to the Soviet Union's first abolition of unequal treaties with us in 1924, and the Soviet Union's first provision of material assistance to us in 1937 for the War of Resistance Against Japan. This time, the impact will be deeper, broader, and more far-reaching, being the first to take action before other countries even start.

From this, it is firmly guaranteed that the Chinese people's revolution will achieve a complete victory. From this, the Chinese people are fully encouraged to continue their efforts to overthrow feudalism, fascism, and imperialism. From this, it is clearly indicated that the Chinese people's revolution will receive strong assistance from the broad sympathy of the world. Today, the first friendly country, the Soviet Union, has extended its hand first, which is a good start. Not only that, but moving forward step by step from this will enable the eastern half of the globe, with China and the Soviet Union first joining hands, to have one people's democratic country after another follow, forming an entire irresistible force to promote the universal progress of people's democracy throughout the world, thereby safeguarding lasting world peace.

"The unwavering establishment of a truly friendly relationship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union" is truly good news for the people of East Asia, truly good news for the people of the world.

Our People's Republic of China has been established for less than three days, and the great Soviet Union was the first to recognize us. This is something we should be extremely grateful and excited about. This matter shows that our 475 million people have, as Chairman Mao said, stood up. Because we have stood up and truly become the masters of our country, we are qualified to join the world's democratic and progressive family headed by the Soviet Union, and no longer appear with the sinful face of being often used as an anti-Soviet tool under the enslavement of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism.

The Soviet Union is a country that takes aiding oppressed nations as its responsibility. As early as twenty-five years ago, when China was still groaning under the cruel oppression of imperialism, the Soviet Union voluntarily abandoned all the privileges seized from China during the Tsarist era and treated China completely equally. Later, during the Chinese Revolution, during the War of Resistance Against Japan, and at the Tehran, Yalta, and Potsdam conferences, the Soviet Union directly and indirectly provided us with countless assistance. In particular, the Soviet combatants sacrificed their lives for our country during the war against Japan, which is especially touching. Due to these facts, we can say that without the Soviet Union's assistance, our People's Republic could not have been realized today. Now, when our people's regime has just been established, the Soviet Union immediately recognized it. I ask, which country in the world has ever treated us like the Soviet Union? However, in the past, because we had not yet gained freedom and the regime was still in the hands of the reactionaries, not only were we unable to repay the Soviet Union for all this friendship, but we were also often sabotaged by the reactionaries and committed many crimes that harmed our Soviet allies. This is infuriating. This anti-Soviet crime is still being shamelessly committed by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, which is about to perish today. Under the instigation of the imperialists, they are performing with bandits like Chiang Tingfu appearing on the podium of Chenggong Lake. I think that the Soviet Union's recognition of us is like a thunderbolt in the haze. I wonder how these ghosts and monsters like Chiang Tingfu will hide!

At a time when warmongering imperialists are plotting to provoke a third world war, the Soviet Union is the mainstay of defending world peace. Not only has she recognized our government, but also the Soviet delegation was present at the inaugural meeting of the Chinese branch of the World Peace Council, which was established in Beijing yesterday. This shows that the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union should join hands in the great struggle against the imperialists' enslavement of the world. I believe that while we are grateful to the Soviet Union for giving us recognition, we should recognize and strive to move forward regarding this responsibility that we should fulfill.
　　Chen Qiyou

The establishment of the People's Republic of China is an epoch-making event in the world. On the second day of its establishment, it was recognized by the great Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's profound and incomparable friendship towards us is forever engraved in the hearts and minds of the Chinese people. With such close unity between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union and the people of the two great nations, plus the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe and the vast number of peace-loving people in the world, the world will be transformed in the future. World lasting peace is more guaranteed, and the various construction undertakings of the Chinese people will also develop rapidly. Let the imperialists and warmongers tremble before us!
　　　　　　　　Xu Deheng

The People's Republic of China and the Central People's Government were born completely representing the interests and will of the absolute majority of the Chinese people. The Soviet government also immediately announced its recognition of our government based on this, which is extremely natural. For more than 30 years, the Soviet Union has helped us in many ways to build an independent and democratic New China. Today we understand even more clearly that the socialist country of the Soviet Union is always a friend of the Chinese people. The revolutionary forces of the Chinese people have defeated the Kuomintang reactionary regime supported by American imperialism, and when the people's own country and regime have just been established, the Soviet Union immediately recognized us. This greatly guarantees the fruits of the Chinese people's revolutionary victory, and also greatly increases the strength of the struggle against enemies at home and abroad. The Soviet Union, China, and other new democratic countries united together have the absolute power to smash any war-provoking and aggressive conspiracies headed by American imperialism, and also have enough power to defend lasting world peace.

Currently, the Kuomintang reactionaries in Taiwan are still implementing extremely brutal rule, wantonly arresting and killing people. Recently, news leaked by senior officials of the reactionaries said that they will execute more than one-third of progressive people and young students this month, and thousands have already been arrested. On the other hand, the conspiracy of American imperialism to invade Taiwan is also becoming very active, but this only shows their final struggle before death. The people of the Soviet Union and the people of China are united and will surely be able to defeat all enemies, so the liberation of Taiwan and the unification of the whole country are only a matter of time.
　　　　　　　　Fang Xuehong

On the second day after the announcement of the establishment of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet government decided to officially recognize our country and was the first to establish diplomatic relations with us. This is definitely not an ordinary diplomatic relationship, but a manifestation of great friendship. Everyone knows that this great friendship is consistent with the Soviet people and the Soviet government's attitude towards the Chinese people, and it has never changed in the 32 years since its founding. In the past, during our difficult years of struggle, this great friendship gave great support to the Chinese people's revolution; and now, this great friendship will undoubtedly give unparalleled help to the Chinese people's nation-building work. The friendly cooperation between the Soviet Union and China is another unparalleled force for consolidating world people's democracy and lasting peace. We, the Inner Mongolian people, like all ethnic groups in China, warmly cheer and celebrate the emergence of this great action. I believe that all peace-loving and democratic people in the world, as well as all oppressed nations, will feel infinitely happy about this and strengthen their confidence in their struggles.
　　Ulanhu

Chinese youth were overjoyed to hear that on the second day after the establishment of our Central People's Government, the great friendly country of the Soviet Union was the first to recognize our country diplomatically; this once again shows that the Soviet people under the leadership of Marshal Stalin are the best friends of the Chinese people and Chinese youth; this shows that since the October Revolution, the traditional friendship between the socialist country of the Soviet Union and the Chinese people has been further developed today; this shows that the nearly 700 million people of China and the Soviet Union will have closer cooperation and unity in the future, which will be a powerful guarantee for Chinese youth to strive for a better life in the future.

The formal establishment of diplomatic relations between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union is a great blow to imperialism and new war provocateurs, and an even greater blow to all the lackeys of imperialism; for the people of the world and the Chinese people, it is a great victory.

In order to commemorate and celebrate this great victory, we Chinese youth, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, must work hard to build a stronger and more powerful New China, carry the revolution through to the end, work hard on economic and cultural construction, and work together with the Soviet people and youth to consolidate lasting world peace. At the same time, we must especially step up learning from the Soviet Union, and widely publicize the profound friendship between the two great friendly countries of China and the Soviet Union to the people of the whole country, so that it will be further developed and carried forward.

　　各党派团体负责人发表书面意见
    感谢苏联承认新中国庆贺中苏建立新邦交（三）
    【本报特讯】苏联政府首先承认新中国的消息发表后，各民主党派团体负责人纷纷发表书面意见，表示感谢，并热烈拥护建立外交关系及互派大使。兹续将民主建国会、中国致公党、九三学社、台湾民主自治同盟、内蒙古自治区、中华全国民主青年联合总会负责人的书面意见发表如下：
    一九四九年十月一日十五时中华人民共和国中央人民政府毛泽东主席公告了中华人民共和国和中央人民政府的成立，二日二十一时四十五分苏联承认中华人民共和国的照会即已电达我外交部周恩来部长，无疑地苏联是承认我中华人民共和国的第一个友邦，承认电文的到达，距离我新中国政府成立的公告，只有三十小时四十五分。
    这是新中国的喜讯，这是中苏两国间的喜讯。不，这是东亚人民的喜讯，这是全世界人民的喜讯。
    我中华人民经过了一百多年来和帝国主义经济侵略者武力侵略者的苦斗，经过了几十年来和封建主义官僚资本主义法西斯主义的苦斗，仰仗了中国共产党的正确领导和人民解放军的英勇作战，赢得了今天的胜利，中华人民共和国的成立。成立以后，第一件事，即是需要与世界各友邦在平等互利互相尊重领土主权等大原则之下，建立外交关系，而领导世界人民革命的苏联，首先伸出手来，表示与我为友，这是和一九二四年苏联首先对我废除不平等条约，一九三七年为了对日抗战，苏联首先对我物质援助，同样的在别国还没有发动时，首先发动，而这一次的影响，将更深，更广，更远大。
    从这上边坚固地保证了中华人民革命定将获得彻底的胜利，从这上边充分地鼓励了中华人民将为推翻封建推翻法西斯推翻帝国主义而继续不断地努力，从这上边明白指示出中华人民革命将从全世界广大的同情而获得坚强的助力，今天第一友邦苏联首先伸出手来，就是一个良好的开始。还不止这些，从这上边一步步前进，将使东半个地球因中苏两个大国的首先携手，一个一个人民民主国家跟上来，构成整个的不可抗的力量，来促成全世界人民民主的普遍进展，因而保卫全世界持久和平。
    “中苏两国人民建立真正友好关系的始终不渝”，这真是东亚人民的喜讯，真是全世界人民的喜讯。　　
　　　　　　　　黄炎培
    我们中华人民共和国成立不到三日，伟大的苏联盟邦，就第一个给我们以承认，这是值得我们万分感激和兴奋的事。这件事说明，我们四万万七千五百万人已经如毛主席所说，站起来了。因为我们站起来真正做了国家的主人，所以才有资格加入世界上以苏联为首的民主进步的大家庭之中，而不再象以往那种在帝国主义封建主义及官僚资本主义奴役之下，常常被带作反苏工具的罪恶面孔出现了。
    苏联是以援助被压迫民族为己任的国家，远在二十五年以前，中国还呻吟在帝国主义残酷压迫之下，苏联就自动放弃了沙皇时代从中国夺去的一切特权，完全以平等对待我们中国。其后，在中国大革命中，在对日抗战中，在德黑兰、雅尔达、波茨坦等会议中，苏联都直接间接给予我们以无数的帮助，而在对日战争中苏联的战斗员为我们的国家牺牲性命，尤为可感。由于这些事实，我们可以说，若没有苏联的援助，我们的人民共和国恐怕也不可能在今天就实现。现在，当我们的人民政权刚刚树立，苏联立即予以承认，试问世界上有那一个国家曾经象苏联这样待我们？不过，以往由于我们还没有得到自由，政权还在反动派的手中，所以苏联这种种友谊，我们不仅没有能够报答，而且还常常被反动派破坏，做出许多伤害苏联盟友的罪行。这是令人愤恨的。这种反苏的罪行，今天已经快要灭亡的蒋介石匪帮，还在无耻的干。他们在帝国主义者唆使之下，正以匪卒蒋廷黻之流出现在成功湖讲坛之上加以表演。我想，苏联对我的承认，实等于阴霾中的霹雳，蒋廷黻这些鬼魅，不知要如何藏形啊！
    在好战的帝国主义者们正在进行挑起第三次世界大战的时候，苏联是保卫世界和平的中流砥柱。她不仅承认了我们的政府，而且我们昨天在北京成立的保卫世界和平会中国分会中，也有苏联的代表团列席，这说明中苏两大民族，在反对帝国主义者奴役世界的伟大斗争中，是应当携手并进的。我以为我们在感谢苏联给予我们承认之余，对于这种应尽的责任，尤应认识而努力迈进。　　陈其尤
    中华人民共和国的成立，是世界上一件划时代的大事。它成立的第二天，就得到伟大的苏联之承认，苏联对我们这种深厚无比的友情，是永铭在中国人民的心中脑中；有了中苏两大国家和两大国家的人民这样亲密的团结，再加上东欧新民主主义的国家和世界上爱好和平的广大人民，今后的世界是要变换一个样子的，世界永久和平是更有保障的，中国人民各项建设事业，也是要突飞猛进向前发展的。让帝国主义者和战争贩子们在我们面前发抖吧！　　　　许德珩
    中华人民共和国和中央人民政府是完全代表着绝对大多数中国人民的利益和意志而诞生出来的。苏联政府也根据这一点马上就宣布承认我们的政府，这是极其当然的事情。三十多年来苏联为了我们建立起一个独立、民主的新中国已经帮助了我们许多事情，今天我们更加明白了社会主义国家苏联永远是我们中国人民的朋友。中国人民的革命力量已经战胜了美帝国主义所支持的国民党反动政权，而刚刚建立起人民自己的国家和政权的时候，苏联立即就承认我们，这样中国人民革命胜利的果实就得到了极大的保障，而对内外敌人的斗争力量也极其增大了。苏联、中国和其他各新民主国家联合起来，就有绝对的力量能够粉碎美帝国主义为首的任何挑拨战争和侵略的阴谋，并且也有足够的力量能保卫世界的持久和平。
    目前台湾国民党反动派还在那里施行极其凶暴的统治，大肆逮捕屠杀，最近由反动派高级官员泄露出来的消息说：于本月中要枪毙三分之一以上的进步人士和青年学生，现在被捕的已达数千人。另一方面美帝国主义侵占台湾的阴谋也很积极起来，但这不过均是说明它们临终的最后挣扎，苏联人民和中国人民联合起来，是一定能战胜一切的敌人的，所以台湾的解放和全国的统一只是时间的问题了。　　　　　访雪红
    在中华人民共和国宣布成立的第二天，苏联政府就决定正式承认我国，第一个与我建立外交关系。这决不是一种平常的外交关系，这是一种伟大友谊的表现。尽人皆知这种伟大友谊是苏联人民和苏联政府对待中国人民始终一贯的，是在其建国三十二年来从无改变的。过去，在我们艰难奋斗的岁月中，这种伟大的友谊曾给予我国人民革命以极大支持；而现在，这种伟大友谊，将无疑会在我国人民建国工作上给予无比的帮助。苏联与中国的友好合作，对巩固世界人民民主与持久和平又是一个无比的力量。这件伟大行动的出现，我们内蒙古民族和中国各民族一样是热烈欢呼与庆贺的。相信全世界一切爱好和平民主的人士，以及一切被压迫民族都将为此而感到无限愉快，并加强自己奋斗的信心。　　乌兰夫
    中国青年听到了在我国中央人民政府成立的第二天，伟大的友邦苏联第一个在外交上承认我国的消息，是没有不欢欣鼓舞的；这又一次说明了在斯大林大元帅领导下的苏联人民是中国人民和中国青年的最好的朋友；这说明了自十月革命以来，社会主义国家的苏联与中国人民的传统的友谊是在今天得到了进一步的发扬；这说明了今后中苏将近七万万人民有更密切的合作和团结，而这将成为中国青年争取未来更美好的生活的一个有力的保证。
    中苏两国人民的邦交的正式建立，对于帝国主义和新战争挑拨者则是一个很大的打击，对于帝国主义的一切走狗更是一个很大的打击；对于世界人民和中国人民来说则是一个伟大的胜利。
    为了要纪念并庆祝这伟大的胜利，我们中国青年要在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，努力把新中国建设得更强大更有力，要把革命进行到底，努力经济和文化的建设，并与苏联人民和青年同为巩固世界持久和平而努力。同时要特别加紧向苏联学习，并把中苏两大友邦的深厚友谊向全国人民广为宣传，使它更发扬光大。
