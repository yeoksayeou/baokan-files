Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 14th: TASS, London - Hundreds of Londoners gathered on the evening of the 7th and unanimously expressed their support for the Soviet proposal to ban atomic bombs and other means of mass destruction. Professor Bernal, speaking at the meeting, condemned the US arms race and emphasized the disastrous consequences of the Labour government's pursuit of military objectives. He stated: "If we engage in an arms race, and military spending, originally at £800 million per year, rises to £1 billion, Britain has no hope of escaping the economic dangers of war."

Bernal particularly emphasized that Britain must develop trade with the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies. He pointed out that he had recently seen many scientific developments in the Soviet Union and had spoken with Lysenko for six hours. Amidst enthusiastic applause, he stated that it was now time for British scientists to learn to understand Lysenko's theories.

Dr. Poussopp, secretary of the Atomic Science Committee of the Association of Scientific Workers, also emphasized in his speech that fighting against those tendencies that are leading Britain to war is patriotism. Sallyson, the national leader of the Tobacco Workers' Union, and Evans, president of the British-Soviet Friendship Society, also spoke at the meeting.

　　伦敦人民集会拥护苏联建议
    赞成禁用原子武器
    贝尔纳谴责美英军备竞赛
    【新华社北京十四日电】塔斯社伦敦讯：七日晚间伦敦数百人集会一致表示赞成苏联所提禁用原子炸弹和其他集体毁灭性的杀人武器的建议。在会上演说的贝尔纳教授谴责美国的军备竞赛；并着重指出工党政府追求军事目的的政策之灾难的后果。他称：“假如我们从事军备竞赛，而原来每年须开支八亿英镑的军费变为十亿英镑，英国在经济上便没有脱出战争危险之望。”
    贝尔纳特别强调称：英国必须和苏联及人民民主国家发展贸易。他指出他最近在苏联曾看到许多科学方面的发展，并曾与李森科唔谈六小时。他在热烈的鼓掌声中称，英国科学家学习去了解李森科的理论现在已是时候了。
    科学工作者协会原子科学委员会书记蒲索浦博士，亦在演讲中强调称，为反对那些将英国引向战争的倾向而斗争就是爱国主义。烟草工人工会全国负责人萨利逊和英苏友好协会会长伊文斯都在会上讲了话。
