Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 3rd -- The full text of the speech by Gerasimov, representative of the Soviet Cultural, Artistic, and Scientific Workers Delegation, at the founding meeting of the China People's Conference for the Defense of World Peace is as follows:

　　Dear friends:

　　I feel extremely honored to be invited to participate in this great conference of the free Chinese people in support of world peace.

　　Not long ago, we held an All-Soviet Union Conference for the Defense of Peace in Moscow, attended by representatives of workers and peasants from all corners of the country, as well as representatives of culture, science, art, and various social organizations. All these people temporarily left their work posts to participate in the conference, all encouraged by a common will to defend the cause of peace, because they all knew that the struggle for peace is now the most important task of all honest people in the world. They shouted with all the strength and determination that the people could muster; they had already established a socialist system in their own country and were bravely marching towards communism; they shattered fascism and saved Europe from the fascist plague.

　　Among the many foreign guests attending the conference were representatives of free China. I cannot describe the enthusiastic welcome they received at the conference. The shouts of welcome for the heroic Chinese people in the hall of the Soviet Building expressed a love and respect for the entire free and democratic China.

　　The delegates at the meeting knew that the victory of the Chinese people in the Liberation War was a new contribution to the cause of peace and a new contribution to the cause of the struggle for happiness by the working humanity. The working people shouted loudly the call for unity at the Moscow Conference for the Defense of Peace. In their speeches, the conference delegates, representing the 200 million people of the Soviet Union, declared their determination to defend the cause of peace and to oppose the bloody conspiracies of the new war instigators. These were not empty words, because behind each speaker were the living actions of the Stakhanovite workers and the collective farm shock workers, these people being scholars, writers, doctors, teachers, artists—that is, all the soldiers on the great labor front who were able to win victory because of the great ideas of Lenin and Stalin.

　　We Soviet people firmly believe that every honest person has used his own labor to shatter the conspiracies of the new aggressors, but cultural workers have a particularly important role to play here. Because the work of writers, artists, and filmmakers, by its very nature, has the mission of awakening millions of people, therefore, we are charged to stand at the forefront of the warriors fighting for peace, international mutual assistance, and friendship.

　　I am a film director. I know that our art, as our great leaders Lenin and Stalin have indicated, is the most important and most mass-oriented of the arts.

　　Now, in these days of fierce struggle between progressive humanity and the reactionary forces of imperialism, the role of filmmakers is even more significant.

　　Filmmakers can reach millions of people, and while being infinitely free in time and space, they can give the audience a very deep impression. Therefore, they can instill ideas into people's consciousness with infinite power. We understand this, so we infinitely love this omnipotent art.

　　Our enemies—the degenerate speculators, the shameless people, and the openly fascist bandits of Hollywood—also know this power of film. Although the people of the world openly hate their dirty productions, they continue to fill the world's screens with pornographic works, mystically absurd works, misanthropic dream talk, and shameless slander. Their sensational films have suffered a miserable bankruptcy in the international film scene. The film audiences who were awakened during the war all hate this dirty torrent.

　　But the Hollywood tycoons, adhering to the will of American aggression, continue to attack the world's silver screen, mass-producing so-called ever-changing "masterpieces", spreading the poison of licentiousness and slaughter, as the foundation of human morality. Confronting this dirty torrent is the power of the film art of the Soviet Union, the New Democracies, and free China.

　　Relying on the wisdom of the great Bolshevik Party and on the love and trust of their audiences, Soviet filmmakers bravely raise in their works the basic issues that inspire the working humanity in our modern life.

　　Soviet filmmakers create all kinds of films. In it, there are films recording heroic deeds, biographies, revolutionary history, comedies, and films depicting the labor and struggle of our ordinary Soviet people. But all these films have one thing in common: no matter what issues they raise, no matter what problems they solve, no matter what part of life they touch on, they often not only strive to explain a certain fact, a certain life situation, but also strive to point out to the people the clear future of their creation, their labor, their struggle; that is, to inspire them to generate new strength.

　　Our art is the art of socialist realism. This means that this art, by its very nature, is an art of action, an art that inspires the masses to build new labor achievements, an art that inspires them to move forward toward communism, an art that moves forward together with the development of all our social thought. Whether it is "Chapayev" directed by the Vasiliev brothers, "The Baltic Deputy" directed by Zarkhi and Kheifets, "The Great Citizen" by Ermler, "Lenin in October," "Lenin in 1918" by Romm, "Alexander Nevsky" by Eisenstein, "Oath" by Chiaureli, the comedies of Pyryev and Alexandrov, Pudovkin's "Admiral Nakhimov," and the many other films made in the years of the development of Soviet film art, are all forever closely in line with the vital interests of their own people. Their main strength lies here.

　　At the same time, with the deepening of the content of our films, their form naturally gradually improves. Striving to make the genre clear is the true color of all truly popular art, and therefore has become the basic characteristic that now determines the genre of Soviet film art. We strive to speak in such a language that our millions of compatriots can understand us, so that our audiences all over the world—millions of working people—can understand us. Only in this way can film art fulfill its mission; only in this way can it truly serve the cause of progress, the cause of peace, and international friendship. If every filmmaker does not think this way, then he does not understand the essence of his own great art.

　　Naturally, the success of Soviet film art is not obtained out of thin air. These successes are the result of the firm struggle of all Soviet filmmakers for the film policy of the Marxist-Leninist Party.

　　Now we are deeply convinced that film can solve all the tasks that only literature could solve before, that is, it creates all the tools that enable it to most fully and most widely express all the styles in the artistic image of actual life.

　　In the years of the Soviet Union's war to defend the motherland, film art devoted all its energy to the cause of defeating the enemy. The following films were made precisely during this period: for example, "The Government Member," "She Defends the Motherland," "The Great Turning Point," "The Oath." In the post-war period, we expressed many of the Party's most important resolutions; these resolutions were made for the cause of deepening the Party spirit of our film art. These historically significant resolutions played a most important role in the further development of Soviet film art.

　　What has been put in the first place? It is to vividly express a new Soviet person, to express a builder of communism, to express a warrior fighting for the happiness of the entire working humanity. And Soviet filmmakers are completing these new and great tasks with great zeal and enthusiasm.

　　Life itself presents an endless variety of things. The 1,500 delegates attending the Soviet Conference for the Defense of Peace are the most outstanding sons and daughters of the Soviet Union. Here, each of us—writers, artists, film directors—sees 1,500 stories, novels, scripts, and films in front of us. Naturally, a brief biography is not a completed dramatic work, but here, the traditional understanding of the concept of novel or drama itself must be somewhat revised. The entire experience of Soviet literature undoubtedly laid the foundation for the experience of Soviet film art. This entire experience constantly tells us that the greatest achievement of Soviet literature is its ability to summarize the biographies of ordinary Soviet people, the builders of communism, in an artistic form. Is Fadeyev's "The Young Guard" a novelist's fiction? This is a moving historical fact, this is a chapter in the history of the Soviet people. As for Polevoi's "The Story of a Real Man," it is simply not a story, but a truly realistic thing, because pilot Meresyev is still alive, and with the facts of his own labor life, he has set an amazing example of heroism, perseverance, and decisiveness. Such works that depict real events and real people are becoming more and more numerous in the Soviet literary world. And immediately following these works are films that directly express the true fate of our country's heroes, the glorious warriors fighting for communism.

　　The scores of such biographical films themselves determine the new characteristics of film art, this art is first of all conscious, it records the glorious representatives of the people in the form of biographies, and gives the people a clear example of heroism, love of the motherland, a clear example of high patriotism and wholehearted service to the people.

　　Can these films also be called dramas? If it is considered that the necessary condition for drama is that the author be good at giving the audience an impression full of activity, then all these works are more profoundly dramatic, because the passionate struggle of progressive people for a just system of life, the happiness and prosperity of the working humanity is the basis of these works.

　　Question, can drama be regarded as more moving than this heroic and sublime struggle for truth?

　　Modern Soviet film art is precisely built on the basis of this truth of life; wherever everyone feels that he has sufficient strength, experience and knowledge, sufficient observation and love for life, then he can get the most interesting results there. If he is not engaged in useless creation, and does not waste his efforts to please the audience with some trivial things, then he will gain great satisfaction in his own creation, because he knows that he is bringing the bright days of the victory of communism, the happiness of the entire people, closer and closer with his art.

　　When we open the newspaper, each of us excitedly searches first for those reports of new victories in the democratic system, reports of the great struggle currently being waged by the people of various countries in the world and their enslavers. In these news, we are particularly excited to read those describing the Chinese people's victory over imperialism and reactionary forces.

　　The heroic achievements of the Chinese people in their liberation struggle, their historically significant victory, fill us with pride, and are proud of the virtues and strength of the human spirit, which are honored to clearly separate the entire progressive camp from the cowardly rabble of imperialism, and separate from the human vampires.

　　The establishment of the People's Republic of China and the establishment of the People's Government mark a new era in the history of the Chinese people. This foreshadows that the genius of the Chinese people will gain unprecedented development, therefore we are deeply convinced that the Chinese people, under the leadership of their own leaders, will lay the foundation of a new democratic culture, and will create such works of art that will show the whole world the entire heroism and virtue of the free Chinese people, as well as their advanced role in human development.

　　Long live the eternal friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people!

　　Long live world peace!

　　Long live Mao Zedong, leader of the Chinese people!

　　Long live the great Stalin!

　　苏联代表团
   　格拉西莫夫演说词
    【新华社北京三日电】苏联文化艺术科学工作者代表团代表格拉西莫夫在中国保卫世界和平大会成立大会上的讲演词全文如下：亲爱的朋友们：
    今天能够被邀请参加这个伟大的、自由的中国人民拥护世界和平大会，我感觉非常的荣幸。
    不久以前，我们在莫斯科开过一次全苏联拥护和平大会，从全国各个角落里来参加的有工人、农民的代表们，文化、科学和艺术工作者们以及各种社会团体的代表们。所有这些人暂时离开他们的工作岗位来参加大会，都是为保卫和平事业这样一个共同的意志所鼓舞，因为他们都知道：争取和平斗争是现在世界上一切正直的人们的最重要的任务。他们以人民所能有的全付力量和坚决性来呼喊；他们已经在自己国家里确立了社会主义制度并勇敢地走向共产主义，他们粉碎了法西斯主义并从法西斯黑死病中拯救了欧洲。
    在参加大会的许多外宾中，也有自由中国的代表。大会上对他们所表现的热烈的欢迎，我在这里是无法形容的。在苏维埃大厦会厅里欢迎英勇的中国人民的狂呼，表现出对于整个自由的、民主的中国的一种热爱和尊敬。
    会议的代表们知道：中国人民在解放战争中的胜利是和平事业的一种新的贡献，同时也是劳动人类争取幸福的斗争事业中的一种新的贡献。劳动人民在莫斯科拥护和平大会上高高地喊出了团结的呼声。在他们讲演里，会议代表们代表苏联二万万人民声明了自己保卫和平事业反对新的战争挑拨者血腥阴谋的决心。这并不是空话，因为在每个讲演者的背后就是斯达汉诺夫运动者们和集体农庄突击队员们活生生的行动，这些人们就是学者、作家、医生、教员、艺术工作者——也就是因为列宁斯大林的伟大思想而能获得胜利的伟大劳动战线上的一切战士。
    我们苏维埃人民深信：每个正直的人士都曾以他自己的劳动来粉碎新侵略者的挑拨阴谋，但是文化工作者在这里更具有特别的作用。因为作家、艺术家、电影工作者们的工作按其本质来说，就负有使千万人民觉醒的使命，因此就责成我们，要我们站在为和平、国际互助和友谊而斗争的战士们的最前列。
    我是电影导演者。我知道：我们的艺术，如同我们伟大的领袖列宁和斯大林所指示的，是艺术中最重要的和最群众性的一种。
    现在，在进步人类跟帝国主义反动势力进行激烈斗争的日子里，电影工作者的作用更为重大。
    电影工作者能够接近千百万的人们，在时间和空间上是无限自由的同时能够给观众以极深的印象，因此他们也就能够以无穷尽的力量把思想灌输到人民的意识中。我们了解这一点，因此我们也就无限爱好这个全能的艺术。
    我们的敌人——好莱坞糜烂的投机家、无耻者和公开的法西斯匪徒们也知道电影的这种力量。虽然全世界人民都公然憎恶他们肮脏的出品，但是他们仍然继续以色情的作品、神秘无稽的作品、憎恶人类的梦呓的作品和无耻诽谤的作品充斥世界的银幕。他们轰动一时的影片在国际影坛惨遭破产。在战争期间觉悟了的电影观众都憎恶这个肮脏的浊流。
    但是好莱坞的大亨们奉行着美国侵略的意旨，继续向世界银坛进攻，滥造所谓日新月异的“杰作”，传播荒淫和屠杀的毒素，作为人类道德的基础。和这个肮脏的浊流对抗的就是苏联、新民主主义国家和自由中国电影艺术的力量。
    苏联电影工作者依靠伟大的布尔塞维克党的智慧，依靠自己观众的爱戴和信任，勇敢地在自己作品里提出我们现代生活中鼓舞劳动人类的基本问题。
    苏联电影工作者，创造出各色各样的影片。在这里面有记载英勇事迹、传记、革命历史的影片，有喜剧，有描写我们平常的苏维埃人们的劳动和斗争的影片。但是所有这些影片却具有一种共同的特点：就是无论他们提出什么问题，无论他们解决什么问题，不管他们涉及到生活的那一部门，他们都常常不仅努力要解释某一事实，某一生活情况，而且努力给人民指示出他们的创造、他们劳动、他们斗争的显明的前途；也就是努力鼓舞他们产生新的力量。
    我们的艺术是社会主义现实主义的艺术。这就是说，这种艺术以其本质来说是一种行动的艺术，是鼓舞群众建立新的劳动功绩，鼓舞他们前进走向共产主义的艺术，是和我们全部社会思想的发展一同前进的艺术。无论是瓦西列夫兄弟导演的“夏伯阳”，无论是查尔赫和海斐茨所导演的“波罗的海来的代表”，无论是埃尔姆列尔的“伟大的公民”，无论是罗姆的“十月的列宁”、“一九一八年的列宁”，无论是爱森斯基的“亚历山大·涅夫斯基”，无论是查乌勒尔的“宣誓”，无论是培列夫和亚历山大洛夫的喜剧，普多夫金的“纳希莫夫海军上将”以及在苏联电影艺术发展的年代里所摄成的许许多多其他的影片，都是永远密切地符合着自己人民切身的利益的。它们的主要力量也就在这里。
    同时，随着我们影片内容的深刻化，它们的形式自然也就逐渐改善了。努力使体裁明显，这是一切真正人民艺术的本色，因此也就成了现在决定苏联电影艺术体裁的那种基本的特点。我们努力用这样的语言来讲话以便我们千百万同胞能够了解我们，以便我们全世界观众——千百万劳动人民能够了解我们。只有这样，电影艺术才能够完成自己的使命；只有这样，它才能够真正为进步事业、为和平事业、为国际友谊而服务。如果每一个电影工作者不这样想，那他就不了解他自己伟大的艺术底本质。
    自然，苏联电影艺术的成功不是凭空得到的。这些成功是苏联电影工作者全体同人坚决为马列主义党的电影方针斗争而得到的结果。
    现在我们深信：电影能够解决以前只有文学才能解决的一切任务，也就是说，它创造了一切的工具，使他能够最充分地最广泛地在艺术的形象中表现实际生活中的一切式样。
    在苏联保卫祖国的战争的年代里，电影艺术以它的全副精力致力于战胜敌人的事业。下面这样一些影片就正是在这个时期摄成的：例如“政府委员”，“她保卫祖国”，“伟大的转变”，“宣誓”。在战后的时期，我们表现了许多党的最重要的决议；这些决议是为了加深我们电影艺术的党性的事业而作的。这些有历史意义的决议在苏联电影艺术进一步的发展中起了最重要的作用。
    曾经被提到第一位的是什么呢？就是要淋漓尽致地表现一种新的苏维埃的人，表现共产主义建设者，表现为自己整个劳动人类的幸福而奋斗的战士。而苏联电影工作者就抱着极大的热心和热情来完成这些新的伟大的任务。
    生活本身就提出了无穷尽的多种多样的东西。出席苏联拥护和平大会的一千五百个代表都是苏联最优秀的儿女，在这里，我们——作家、艺术家、电影导演的每一个人都在自己前面看到一千五百个故事、小说，脚本和影片。自然，简略的传记还不是完成的戏剧作品，但在这里对于小说或戏剧概念本身的传统的了解要作某种修正。苏联文学的全部经验，无疑奠定了苏联电影艺术经验的基础，这个全部经验不断地指示我们：苏联文学最大的成果就是它善于以艺术的形式总结苏维埃普通的人们，共产主义建设者们的传记。法捷耶夫同志的“青年近卫军”——这难道是小说家的虚构吗？这是动人魂魄的史实，这是苏联人民历史的一章。至于波立味的“钢铁意志”，那简直不是一个故事，而是一个真正现实性的东西，因为飞行员马勒西耶夫仍然活着，而且以他自己劳动生活的事实树立起英勇、坚毅、果决的惊人的榜样。描写真实事件和真实人物的这样的著作，在苏联文坛上是愈来愈多了。而紧接在这些著作的后面就出现了直接表现我们祖国英雄们，为共产主义而斗争的光荣战士们的真正命运的影片。
    数目有几十种之多的这种传记性的影片本身就决定了电影艺术的新的特点，这种艺术是首先有觉悟性的，它用传记的形式记述人民的光荣的代表者，而给人民一种英勇、热爱祖国的显明的榜样，一种高度爱国主义的和全心全意为人民服务的显明的榜样。
    能够把这些影片也叫做戏剧作品吗？如果认为戏剧的必要条件是要作者善于给观众一种充满活动的印象的话，那么所有这些作品就更深刻地具有戏剧性，因为前进的人们为了争取正义的生活制度、劳动人类的幸福和繁荣而进行的热情的斗争就是这些作品的基础。
    试问，能不能把戏剧看得比较这个为真理的英勇的崇高的斗争更为感人呢？
    现代苏联电影艺术就正是建筑在这个生活的真理的基础之上；在什么地方让大家觉得自己有充分的力量、经验和知识，有充分的观察力和对生活的热爱，那末他在那里就可以得到最有兴趣的结果。如果他不在从事无用的创作，不枉费心机以某种琐碎的小事来买好观众的话，那么他就在自己的创作中获得极大的满意，因为他知道他以自己的艺术使共产主义胜利的光明的日子，使整个人民的幸福日益接近了。
    打开报纸的时候，我们每一个人都兴奋地在首先找寻那些报导民主制度新的胜利，报导目下世界各国人民和他们奴役者所进行的伟大的斗争的消息。在这些消息里面，我们特别兴奋地读到那些描写中国人民战胜帝国主义和反动势力的消息。
    中国人民在他们解放斗争中的英勇功绩，他们那具有历史意义的胜利，使我们充满了骄傲，为人类精神的美德和力量而自豪，这种精神很荣幸地使整个进步的阵营和帝国主义怯懦的败类的阵营截然分开，和人类吸血鬼截然分开。
    中华人民共和国的建基和人民政府的成立在中国人民的历史上标志出一个新的时代。这个预示着中国人民的天才将获得空前的发挥，因此我们深信：中国人民在他们自己领袖的领导之下将奠定新民主主义文化的基础，将创作出这样的艺术作品来，这些作品将把自由的中国人民的整个英雄主义事业和美德，以及他们在人类发展中的先进作用显示给全世界。
    中苏两国人民永久的友谊万岁！
    全世界和平万岁！
    中国人民领袖毛泽东万岁！
    伟大的斯大林万岁！
