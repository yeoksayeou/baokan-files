Simonov Talks About Drama
　　　　Chen Ji
Simonov, who grew up with the Soviet system and stands on the peak of the world's literary scene, is a prominent Soviet novelist, playwright, poet, and journalist. His works, such as "Days and Nights," "The Russian Question," "A Boy from Our Town," and "The Russians," have all won Stalin Prizes and are the most familiar works to the Chinese people. The author of these works is also our dearest friend. On the great day of the founding of the People's Republic of China, he came to Beijing, and the Chinese people welcomed him like a brother, listening to his lectures. On October 10th, at a drama symposium organized by the National Drama Association, we were fortunate enough to hear him answer many questions about drama work.

Smiling and looking at us with a pipe in his mouth, Simonov first answered our question about the proportion of classical and contemporary plays in the Soviet drama world. Of course, he emphasized that modern plays reflecting current reality should account for a larger proportion, but he firmly told us: "The valuable and beneficial things for the people in classical plays should be respected. After the October Revolution in the Soviet Union, some people opposed all classical art before the revolution, saying that all art from the Tsarist and capitalist eras was worthless. They wanted to build new things on a clean slate. However," Simonov said, "they forgot that there were also people in the Tsarist and capitalist eras." He believed that denying all old typical art was disrespectful to the people. Revolutionary works give life great power, and this power is by no means generated out of nothing; it is the accumulation of the people's wisdom. The people create revolution. Each nation has its own culture and art, and when the people become masters, they should feel especially precious about their past treasures, and return the people's things to the people. In art, we should critically analyze the artistic wealth of the past, and find out who are the friends and enemies of the people from the classical works. When absorbing the old typical art, we should recognize who advocates humanism, who looks up to the working people, and who is our friend. People hundreds of years ago would not speak like today. But as long as it loves the people, it should be respected, learned from, and its essence absorbed to enrich our present. This is why the Soviet state performs classical dramas. It will continue to do so in the future. Things in classical plays that tend towards goodness are beneficial to the masses when performed, and even those dark and terrifying scenes are beneficial to us. Today, people see that today's freedom and light are not easy to come by. Also, the moral flaws of the past are much fewer or nonexistent today. But when people see these flaws, they will become more vigilant.

Whether performing new or old dramas, he believes that they should be given new life. For classical dramas, it is not about completely changing their original form, but about teaching people new revolutionary perspectives. For example, Ostrovsky's "Mad Money" describes various capitalists, some progressive and some reactionary. Sixty years ago, some of the progressive capitalists it described were heroes admired by the people at the time; but sixty years later, there is a new view. In the past, rich men and poor women could not marry; educated men and uneducated women could not marry. But today it is different. If a man is uneducated, an educated woman can tell him that he should study; past plays mostly talked about the power of money. But money has lost its position in Soviet plays, although money still exists in the Soviet Union, some people have more money and some have less, but people with less money will not cry or hang themselves. The new era has produced new characters.

Simonov believed that if an outstanding artist wants to express new characters well, he himself must be a new character. He should live and work in the new society, understand the new life, he should care about improving the production efficiency of factories, he should care about the harvest in the countryside, and care about whether the trains depart on schedule. Only then can his soul be integrated with the new characters, and then he can create new art.

Regarding the reform of Chinese old opera, he said that he knows too little and has seen too little, but he dares to say that China should cherish its own classical artistic heritage as much as the Soviet Union. As for what should be preserved and what should be discarded, it is a matter for the Chinese drama and art circles. A few days ago, he only saw a few short plays such as "Yang Paifeng", "Zhong Kui Marrying His Sister", "Red Luanxi Pushing the River", "Dingjun Mountain" and "Cosmic Front" at Huairentang. He believed that Chinese old opera is not walking a simple path, but encompasses a variety of styles. Taking those few short plays as examples, there are tragedies, comedies, and farces, with tears and humor, as rich as an ocean. He believed that Chinese artists can draw from this ocean the infinite nourishment they need.

Regarding how to cultivate dramatists, Simonov introduced the Soviet Union's valuable example. In the Soviet Union, the Soviet Writers' Association is specifically responsible for this work, helping writers to learn and work. The Writers' Association tries its best to solve what a writer needs to know and what materials he needs. If a writer wants to go to a factory or collective farm, the Writers' Association can send him there, where he can live for a few months, or even a few years, until he is completely familiar with his object of description. What the writer writes must be what he understands, otherwise people will not believe what he writes. The source of funds for helping new writers is the literary and art fund organized by the Writers' Association. For every book published by a writer, ten percent is given to the foundation. The more books are published, the larger the foundation's amount.

The theaters in the Soviet Union have literary departments, and those who have talent but are not familiar with the stage can get help from the theater, allowing them to work in the theater and learn stage techniques to improve their works. Simonov recalled that when he handed over his play "A Love Story" to the Lenin Communist Youth Theater, it was a four-act play with twenty characters. After the revision, it was reduced to three acts and seven characters. The script was shortened, but he became smarter.

For amateur playwrights, he said that they must first rely on the guidance of experts, and the responsibility of artists is to help others. Workers, peasants, and soldiers who love drama can produce and fight. To elevate these valuable things to art, they must study art and culture in depth, learn from experienced experts, and learn from typical works in order to better produce art.

In the Soviet Union, writers from various regions hold a meeting every year to review each person's work, select the best writers in each region, and send them to the province; people from the province gather together to review again, select better ones and send them to the center of each republic, and then review and discuss again, and send the best to Moscow, and then review and discuss again, to see who is the best. Moscow performs the best works once a year. They become experts in this way, and they have to study more deeply in order to create more complete works.

When we asked about his "Russian Question," we listened more intently to his experience in creating this great work of world significance. He said that he lived in the United States for nine months and studied the lives of American journalists every day. He laughed easily: "But I never caught their point of view. This play does not represent their point of view, but represents how I see them." He wrote this play with two motives, first, he wanted to let the Soviet people know what kind of people American journalists are, and second, he wanted to tell the Soviet people who in American society are our friends and who are our enemies. American journalists have made many abuses against the Soviet Union, and he wanted to tell everyone what manufacturing processes these abuses went through; and how difficult it is for a conscientious person to work in the American press. Smith is a conscientious American journalist, he wants to tell the truth, he is unwilling to sell his conscience, so he has to suffer. All the struggles in this play come from different views on the Russian question. Progressive people sympathize with the Soviet Union and are unwilling to speak against their conscience; reactionary people hate the Soviet Union and create shameless rumors that are unfavorable to the Soviet Union. The people of the whole world are divided into two major camps on the Russian question. He arranged these characters with different views around the "Russian Question." Due to different views, there are tense and profound struggles. He wrote "The Russian Question" based on this realistic theme of world significance, and it now shines brightly on the world, allowing people to see friends and enemies more clearly.

Today, the People's Republic of China is born. Due to different views on the new China, people all over the world are also divided into two camps, revolutionary and counter-revolutionary, without exception. Simonov hopes that Chinese writers can also write realistic and educational works on this issue, so that the people will know: "Those who rejoice and applaud the birth of the new China are progressive and friends of the world's people; those who are discouraged and curse the birth of the new China are reactionary and enemies of the world's people."

　　西蒙诺夫谈戏剧
    陈迹
    伴随着苏维埃制度生长起来的，屹立于世界文坛高峰的西蒙诺夫，是苏联杰出的小说家、戏剧家、诗人和记者。他的作品如“日日夜夜”“俄罗斯问题”“我们镇上来的孩子”“俄罗斯人”，都荣获了史大林奖金，是中国人民最熟悉的作品，这些作品的作者也是我们最亲爱的朋友。中华人民共和国成立的伟大日子里，他来到了北京，中国人民象亲兄弟似的迎接他，听他的讲演。十月十日，在全国剧协主办的戏剧座谈会上，我们又荣幸地听他解答关于戏剧工作的许多问题。
    衔着烟斗微笑地看着我们，西蒙诺夫首先答复了我们所问的苏联戏剧界古典剧与现在剧的比重。当然他强调反映当前现实的现代剧应占更大比重，但他坚信地对我们说：“古典戏中有价值的对人民有利的东西，应予尊重。在苏联十月革命后，有些人反对革命前的一切古典艺术，说沙皇时代和资本主义时代的一切艺术都要不得。而想在清洁的土地上建立起新的东西。可是，西蒙诺夫说，他们却忘记了在沙皇时代与资本主义时代也还有人民存在。他认为否定一切旧的典型的艺术，是不尊敬人民。具有革命性的作品，给生命以巨大力量，这个力量决不是从空虚中一下子产生出来的；而是人民才智的积累。人民是创造革命的。每个民族都有其自己的文化和艺术，当人民做了主人的时候，对于自己的过去的宝藏应该特别感到可贵，人民要把人民的东西归还给人民。在艺术方面，就要批判地分析过去的艺术财富，从古典作品中，找出人民的朋友和敌人来。在吸取旧的典型的艺术的当儿，要认清谁是提倡人道主义的，谁是看得起劳动人民的，谁就是我们的朋友。几百年前的人说的话不会象今天一样。但只要它是爱人民的，就该尊敬它，学习它，并吸取其精华，丰富我们的今天。苏维埃国家之所以排演古典戏剧，就是这个道理。将来也还会这样做。在古典剧中趋向善良的东西，给群众演出是有好处的，就是那些黑暗可怕的场面也对我们有益。今天人民看到了，可以知道今天的自由光明得来何等不易。又过去人的道德缺陷，在今天是少多了，或是没有。但当人们看到这些缺陷，将越发警惕了。
    无论排演新旧戏剧，他认为都应该给以新的生命。对于古典剧，并非全部改变其原本，而是教人以革命的新看法。比如粤斯特罗夫斯基的“疯狂的金钱”，是描写各种资本家，有前进的，也有反动的。在六十年前，它所描述的前进资本家有些是当时人民所爱戴的英雄；但在六十年后便有新的看法了。以前，社会上有钱的男人，和没有钱的女人是不能结婚的；受过教育的男人，和没有受过教育的女人也不能结婚。但在今天却不然了，男的没受教育，受过教育的女人可以对他讲你应该念书；以前的剧本多谈到金钱的威力。但金钱在苏联剧本中已失掉它的地位，虽然钱在苏联还存在，有的人钱多一点，有的钱少一点，但钱少的人也不会哭，也不致上吊。新的时代产生了新的人物。
    一个优秀的艺术家要想把新人物很好的表现出来，西蒙诺夫以为他自身必须要是一个新人物。他应该在新社会中生活工作，对新生活有所了解，他应关心着工厂生产效率的提高，他应关心农村的收获，关心列车是否按班次开出一类的事。这样他的灵魂才能和新人物溶在一起，这样他才能创造新的艺术。
    关于中国旧剧改革，他说他知道得太少，见得太少，但他敢说：中国应和苏联一样宝爱其自己的古典艺术遗产，至于究竟何者应该保存，何者应该抛弃，却是中国剧艺界的问题。前些日子，他只在怀仁堂看到了“杨排风”“钟馗嫁妹”“红鸾禧推江”“定军山”“宇宙锋”等几个短剧。他以为中国旧歌舞剧不是走着一条单纯的道路，而是包涵着多种多样的风格。拿那几个短剧来说，有悲剧，有喜剧，也有闹剧，有眼泪也有幽默，丰富得象一个海洋。他以为中国艺术家可从这海洋中吸取其需要的无限的营养。
    如何培养戏剧家，西蒙诺夫介绍了苏联的宝贵的榜样。在苏联有苏联作家协会专门负责这项工作，帮助作家们学习工作。一个作家需要了解什么，需要一些什么材料，作家协会都尽力去替他解决。如果一个作家希望到工厂、集体农场去，作家协会可以送他去，在那里住上几月，甚至几年，直到他完全熟悉他的描写对象为止。作家所写的东西必定是他所了解的，不然人家不会相信他所写的东西。这笔帮助新作家的经费的来源是作家协会举办的文艺基金。作家所出版的书，每本抽百分之十交给基金会。书的发行额多，所以基金数目也大。
    苏联的剧院都设有文艺部，有天才而不熟悉舞台，可以得到剧院的帮助，让他在剧院工作，学习舞台技术，以改进其作品。西蒙诺夫回忆他把他所著的“一个爱情的故事”的剧本交给列宁青共剧场时，是四幕剧，剧中人物有二十个经修改后剩了三幕，七个登场人物。剧本是缩短了，他却变聪敏了。
    对于业余剧作家，他说，首先要靠专家们的指导，而艺术家的责任在于帮助别人。爱好戏剧的工农兵们会生产，会打仗，要把这些宝贵的东西提升为艺术，就得要深入的学习艺术文化，从有经验的专家那里学习，从典型的作品学习，才能更好地产生艺术。
    在苏联各地区，作家们每年召开一次会议，检讨各人的工作，选出每地区最好的作家，送到省里去；省里的人集会在一起又检讨，选出更好的送到每一共和国的中心，又检阅讨论，把最好的送到莫斯科，又检阅讨论，看看谁顶好，莫斯科一年排演一次最好的作品。他们这样地成了专家，他们还要更深入的研究，以期创造更完整的作品。
    当我们问到他的“俄罗斯问题”，我们更紧张地听着他创作这本具有世界性的伟大作品的经验。他说他曾在美国住了九个月，每天研究美国新闻记者的生活。他轻松的笑道：“可是我永远没有感染他们的看法。我这个剧本，并非代表他们的看法，而是代表我怎样看他们。”他是以两个动机来写作这剧本的，第一，他想让苏联人民知道美国新闻界都是些什么人物，第二想告诉苏联人民在美国社会中那些人是我们的朋友，那些人是我们的敌人。美国新闻界对苏联作了许多谩骂，他想告诉大家这谩骂是经过哪些制造过程的；以及一个有良心的人在美国新闻界工作是怎样的困难。史密斯便是位美国有良心的记者，他要说实话，他不愿出卖良心，他便得蒙受苦难。所有这剧中的斗争都由于对俄罗斯问题不问的看法来的。进步的人同情苏联，不肯昧着心说话；反动的人仇视苏联，制造对苏联不利的无耻造谣。全世界人类在俄罗斯问题上分成了两大阵营。他把这些不同看法的人物安排在“俄罗斯问题”的周围。由于看法不同，便有紧张深刻的斗争。他根据这种具有世界性的现实题材，写成的“俄罗斯问题”，于今已灿烂地照耀着全球，让人民把敌友看得更清楚了。
    今天中华人民共和国诞生了，由于对新中国的看法，全世界的人也分成革命与反革命两个阵营，无一可以例外。西蒙诺夫希望中国作家也能就这个问题写出现实的教育性作品来，使人民知道：“为新中国诞生而欢欣鼓舞的，是前进的，是世界人民的朋友；因新中国诞生而气馁诅咒的，是反动的，是世界人民的敌人。”
