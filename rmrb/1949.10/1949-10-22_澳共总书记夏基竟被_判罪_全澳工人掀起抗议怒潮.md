　　Australian Communist Party General Secretary Sharkey Actually "Convicted"
  　Wave of Protests Erupts Among Workers Across Australia
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 21st: Sydney dispatch: Sharkey, General Secretary of the Australian Communist Party, who was accused of making statements supporting the anti-war declaration of French Communist Party leader Thorez, was sentenced to three years in prison by the Melbourne Supreme Court on the 17th for "making treasonous remarks." Workers across Australia have been angered by this and have launched a wave of protests. Two thousand five hundred miners from eight coal mines in New South Wales went on strike on the 18th to protest Sharkey's sentencing. Dockworkers in Sydney held mass rallies, unanimously protesting the shameless verdict against Sharkey. Three hundred workers from a railway factory near Sydney demanded at a mass rally that Sharkey's verdict and the anti-democratic legislation on which it was based be immediately revoked.
    The Central Committee of the Australian Communist Party issued a special statement on Sharkey's verdict, calling on the working class and all democrats to demand Sharkey's release and the annulment of his verdict. The statement pointed out that Sharkey's sentencing is part of a sinister plan to drag the Australian people into an anti-Soviet war being organized by the American ruling clique, a plan which constitutes a serious threat to Australia's national independence.
    Note: Sharkey was charged for making statements on March 5th of this year opposing the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty. After being convicted by the "Federal Special Court," Sharkey appealed to the Supreme Court, but the appeal was rejected. The indictment of Sharkey aroused a wave of protests from the Australian working class. The 23,000 members of the Australian Waterside Workers' Federation held a one-day general strike on March 27th to protest Sharkey's "trial."

　　澳共总书记夏基竟被“判罪”
  　全澳工人掀起抗议怒潮
    【新华社北京二十一日电】悉尼讯：因发表谈话支持法共领袖多列士反战声明而被控告的澳大利亚共产党总书记夏基，已于十七日被墨尔本最高法院以“发表叛国言论”罪判处三年徒刑。全澳工人已因此激起愤怒的抗议运动。新南威尔斯州八个煤矿的二千五百名矿工，已于十八日起发动罢工，抗议对夏基的判决。悉尼码头工人纷纷举行群众大会，一致抗议对夏基的无耻判决。悉尼附近铁路工厂的三百名工人，在群众大会上要求立即取消对夏基的判决及这个判决所根据的反民主立法。
    澳共中央委员会对夏基的判决发表特别声明，号召工人阶级与一切民主人士要求释放夏基并取消对他的判决。声明指出：对夏基的判决是将澳大利亚人民卷入正在由美国统治集团组织之反苏战争的罪恶计划的一部分，这个计划已构成对澳大利亚民族独立的严重威胁。
    按：夏基系因今年三月五日发表谈话反对侵略性的北大西洋公约被控。夏基在被“联邦特种法庭”判决犯罪后，曾向最高法院上诉，结果竟被驳回。夏基之被控，曾激起澳大利亚工人阶级抗议的怒潮，澳码头工人工会两万三千会员，曾在三月二十七日总罢工一天，以抗议对夏基的“审讯”。
