　　Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 15th—The Wuhan Shipping Advancement Association, in order to encourage the export of native products, has decided to reduce freight rates for native products exported from the Yangtze River, effective from the 15th. A total of twenty kinds of native products, including beans, tobacco leaves, and eggs, will have their freight rates reduced by 20 to 44 percent respectively. Note: The native products of Central China, concentrated in Wuhan, have always been mostly transported and sold to various places downstream of the Yangtze River. At present, due to the relatively high freight rates, the price difference between Shanghai and Wuhan is almost negligible, and merchants have little profit to gain, and are not very active in transportation and sales. In order to give full play to the role of Yangtze River shipping, to cooperate with the economic construction of Central China, to prosper Greater Wuhan, and to more effectively support Shanghai, the shipping industry has made the above provisions.

  　减低输出运价
    奖励土产外销
    【新华社汉口十五日电】武汉市航业协进会为鼓励土产外销，决定自十五日起，减低由长江输出的土产品的运费价格。计豆类、烟叶、鸡蛋等二十种土产品，运费价格分别减低百分之二十到四十四不等。按：集中武汉的华中土产品，一向大部运销长江下游各地。目前以运价较高，沪汉两地价格相差无几，客商无利可图，对运销多不积极。航业界为发挥长江航运的作用，以配合华中经济建设，繁荣大武汉和更有效的支援上海，特作上项规定。
