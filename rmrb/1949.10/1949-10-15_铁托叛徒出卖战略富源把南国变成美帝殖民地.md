Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 14th: TASS, Moscow: The Red Star newspaper published an article on the 12th entitled "The Tito Clique Sells Out Yugoslavia's Natural Resources," stating: Certain details of how the Belgrade rulers obtained loans from the United States have now come to light. When Tito requested a loan from the United States at the beginning of this year, the American financial magnates did not immediately respond. The New York Herald Tribune said: If Tito does not agree to certain demands of the State Department, he will not get the loan. Thereupon, this American spy, Tito, gladly agreed to all the demands of his master. Then the United States came up with money to save the fascist regime of Yugoslavia. According to French newspaper reports, one of the main conditions for granting the Tito clique a $20 million loan was to increase the amount of strategic raw materials shipped from Yugoslavia to the United States. British radio reported: Yugoslavia had already increased the amount of strategic raw materials delivered to the United States last year. Non-ferrous metals shipped to the United States in December 1948 alone equaled the total amount delivered in the entire year of 1947. The quantity of goods delivered this year has increased significantly. In the first half of the year, Yugoslavia's copper exports increased threefold compared to 1948, and lead increased sixfold. American financial magnates also demanded control over the exploitation rights of Yugoslavia's strategic raw materials. Newspapers have published news about representatives of the largest American monopoly capitalists visiting Yugoslavia and holding secret talks with the Tito clique to grant American capitalists special privileges to develop the country's natural resources. In August, a special mission of American bankers also arrived in Belgrade to study the country's economic situation. In a memorandum to the UN Economic and Social Council on September 15, 1949, the Belgrade rulers stated even more bluntly: "Yugoslavia must develop into an agro-industrial country that produces industrial and agricultural raw materials," and claimed that the Yugoslav government, in planning its measures, "does not take the economic independence of the country as its goal." The Belgrade traitors have placed the South under the control of American monopoly capitalists, turning the South into a colony of American capital.

　　铁托叛徒出卖战略富源把南国变成美帝殖民地
    【新华社北京十四日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：十二日红星报刊载题为“铁托集团出卖南斯拉夫天然富源”一文称：贝尔格莱德统治者从美国获得借款的某些详情细节现已显露。今年年初铁托向美国请求借款时，美国金融巨头未即答复，纽约先驱论坛报说：假如铁托不答应国务院的某些要求，他将得不到借款。于是这个美国间谍铁托欣然同意了其主子的一切要求。接着美国便拿出金钱去拯救南斯拉夫的法西斯政权了。据法国报纸消息：给予铁托集团以二千万美元贷款的主要条件之一乃是增加自南斯拉夫运往美国的战略原料。英国无线电台报道：南斯拉夫去年就已经增加了交与美国的战略原料，仅仅一九四八年十二月运往美国的非铁金属即等于一九四七年全年所交付的数目。今年交货数量大大增加，上半年南斯拉夫铜的出口较一九四八年增加了三倍，铅增加了六倍。美国金融巨头也要求控制南斯拉夫的战略原料的开采权，报纸已刊出关于美国最大垄断资本家的代表访问南斯拉夫，并和铁托集团密谈，给予美国资本家以开发该国天然富源之特权的消息。八月间美国银行家特别使团又抵达贝尔格莱德研究该国经济情况，贝尔格莱德的统治者于一九四九年九月十五日致联合国经社理事会的备忘录中更直截了当地说：“南斯拉夫必须发展为生产工业与农业原料的农工业国家”，并称，南斯拉夫政府在计划其措施时，“并不把南国的经济独立作为目标。”贝尔格莱德叛徒已把南国置于美国垄断资本家的控制之下，将南国变成美国的资本的殖民地。
