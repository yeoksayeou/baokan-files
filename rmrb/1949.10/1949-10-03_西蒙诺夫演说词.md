Simonov's Speech

Dear friends:

I, on behalf of the Soviet delegation and the Standing Committee of the Soviet Peace Congress, extend brotherly greetings to you all and thank you for your brotherly hospitality.

I am honored to mention Mr. Sun Yat-sen's prediction in his letter to the Soviet Central Executive Committee, in which he wrote: "Dear Comrades, I am now saying goodbye to you, and I would like to express my hope that the Soviet Union will find friends and allies in a strong and free China. In the struggle to liberate the oppressed nations of the world, these two allies will walk hand in hand towards victory. Such a day is not far away."

The All-China Peace Congress is being held on a historically significant day for the great Chinese people.

Yesterday, all the Soviet people and progressive people all over the world listened with joy to the establishment of the Government Committee of the People's Republic of China, headed by the leader of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong.

The All-China Peace Congress is being held on the second day of this greatest event in Chinese history, in Beijing, the capital of unified China, which is of great significance.

The significance is great because the struggle for people's unity, for equality with other nations, for the survival conditions of mankind, and for true people's democracy - in which the Chinese people have just won a great victory - is closely related to and inseparable from the struggle for peace.

The people of any country, whether in the past, present or future, do not want war. The American people do not want war, and the British people do not want war. Although the shameless Tito renegade clique attempts to drag the Yugoslav people into the arms of American imperialism against their will, they do not want war either.

Any government that can truly represent the interests of the people will always advocate peace and will always fight against warmongers. The entire experience of peaceful construction in the people's democratic countries proves this.

Now that the Chinese people have kicked away American imperialism and are eradicating from their country those warlords and deeply entrenched warmongers who not long ago tried to plunge the entire country into misery, this is not only a just act but also a great contribution of the Chinese people to the cause of world peace.

The Chinese people are eliminating warmongers for their own future peaceful life and peaceful construction, and for the peace of the world.

It is precisely for this reason that the progressive people all over the world who participated in the World Congress of Peace Supporters in Paris and Prague in April of this year warmly welcomed the news of the liberation of Nanjing by the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

We, the representatives of the World Congress of Peace Supporters, knew at that time in Paris and Prague that this victory of the Chinese people was advancing the cause of peace.

Now, in this free ancient capital of China, we hear the powerful voice of the Chinese people, calling for peace all over the world.

It is a great honor for us Soviet people to speak at this All-China Congress for the defense of peace and the struggle against new warmongers, representing the social figures of our motherland.

Our country has been fighting unyieldingly for peace for more than thirty years since the Great October Revolution.

The Soviet Union has been leading the peace camp and has been fighting for peace. This is not only because our people need peace for peaceful construction and for the peaceful development of all creative forces, but also because war brings death and suffering to all the people trapped in it.

It is the duty of every Soviet person to care about all working people in the world and to care about their interests.

All ordinary and honest people in the world do not want war. But unfortunately, many of them live under governments and the tyranny of those who provoke war. But we appeal to these ordinary people through these governments. Let everyone contribute their strength to this common cause of peace, which is precious to all mankind. Let everyone know that the cause of peace is strengthened today, and that we—the world's peace supporters—are stronger than ever before. Today's conference is a great proof of this.

Striving for peace is not an easy task, so perseverance, courage, and perseverance are necessary.

Are we two great peoples—the Chinese and Soviet peoples—not persevering enough in the struggle?

Have the people of our two countries not shown the highest examples of heroism in the world?

Finally, our two peoples have extended the hand of peace and friendship to all peace-loving people in the world. Is there anything in the world more powerful than their strength?

Long live the perseverance, courage, and strength we have shown in the great cause of defending peace against warmongers!

Long live the great Chinese people who bravely strive for peace under the leadership of their leader Mao Zedong!

Long live Stalin! Long live the Stalin peace policy that has opened up a bright future for all mankind!

Long live world peace!

　　西蒙诺夫演说词
    【新华社北京二日电】中国保卫世界和平大会成立大会上苏联文化艺术科学工作者代表团副团长西蒙诺夫演说词全文如下：亲爱的朋友们：
    我代表苏联代表团和苏联拥护和平大会常务委员会向各位致兄弟的敬礼，并感谢你们兄弟般的招待。
    我很荣幸地提到孙中山先生在他致苏联中央执行委员会的信件中的预见，他曾写道：“亲爱的同志们，我现在要和你们告别了，我愿意表示希望就是苏联将在强大的自由的中国找到朋友和同盟者，在解放全世界被压迫民族的斗争中，这两个同盟者将手携手地走向胜利，这样的日子已经不远了。”
    全中国拥护和平大会正在伟大中国人民的有历史意义的日子里举行。
    昨天全体苏联人民及全世界进步人士以愉快的心情听到了以中国人民领袖毛泽东为首的中华人民共和国政府委员会的成立。
    全中国和平大会正在这个中国人民历史上最伟大的事件的第二天，在统一中国的首都北京举行，这个意义是非常重大的。
    意义的重大是因为：为了人民团结，为了争取与其他民族平等，为了争取人类生存条件，为了真正人民民主而进行斗争——在这种斗争中中国人民刚刚获得了伟大的胜利——这个斗争与争取和平的斗争是密切关联而不可分离的。
    任何一国人民，无论是过去，现在或者将来都不愿意战争。美国人民不愿意战争，英国人民不愿意战争。虽然无耻的铁托叛卖集团企图违反南斯拉夫人民的意志把他们牵入到美国帝国主义的怀抱里，但他们也不愿意战争。
    凡是能够代表人民真正利益的政府，那它就永远主张和平，它就永远同战争贩子作斗争。各人民民主国家和平建设的全部经验就证明了这一点。
    中国人民踢开了美国帝国主义之后，现在正在把那些不久以前还企图使整个国家陷入水深火热之中的军阀们，根深蒂固的战争贩子们，从自己国家铲除出去，这不但是正义的行为，而且也是中国人民对于全世界和平事业的伟大贡献。
    中国人民为了自己未来和平生活与和平建设，为了全世界的和平而消灭着战争贩子。
    正是因为这个原因，本年四月间参加巴黎和布拉格全世界拥护和平大会的全世界进步人士对于中国人民解放军解放南京的消息，才这样热烈的欢迎。
    我们，全世界拥护和平大会代表，那时在巴黎和布拉格就知道：中国人民的这个胜利正在推进着和平事业。
    现在我们在这自由中国古老的京城中听到中国人民的有力呼声，呼吁全世界的和平。
    在这全中国保卫和平事业与新战争贩子斗争的大会上，代表自己祖国的社会人士讲话，对于我们苏联人是莫大的荣幸。
    我们国家自伟大十月革命以来，经过三十余年的时间一直都在不屈不挠地为和平而奋斗。
    苏联一直在领导和平阵营，一直在为和平而奋斗。这不仅是因为我们的人民为了和平建设，为了安宁地发展全部创造力量，需要和平；而且也是因为战争给陷在这里面的一切人民带来的死亡和痛苦。
    关心世界上一切劳动的人民，关心他们的利益，这是每一个苏维埃人民的义务。
    所有世界上平常的和正直的人们都不愿意战争。可是不幸，他们中间的许多人都生活在战争挑拨者统治的政府和淫威之下。但是我们经过这些政府向这些平常的人们呼吁。让每一个人都在这一对于全人类宝贵的共同的和平事业中供献出自己的力量。让每一个人都知道：今天的和平事业是加强了，我们——世界和平拥护者——的力量，是从来没有这样强大过的。今天在此地举行大会就是一个伟大的证明。
    争取和平不是一件容易的事情，因此必须要有坚忍，勇敢，毅力。
    难道我们这两个伟大的人民——中国和苏联人民——在斗争中还不够坚忍吗？
    难道我们两国人民还没有表现出来世界上最高的英勇的范例吗？
    最后，我们两国人民曾经向世界上一切爱好和平的人民伸出过和平与友谊的手，难道世界上还有什么东西比他们的力量更强大吗？
    我们在保卫和平反对战争贩子的伟大事业中所表现的坚忍，英勇和力量万岁！
    在自己的领袖毛泽东领导下英勇争取和平的伟大的中国人民万岁！
    斯大林万岁！给全人类开辟了光明前途的斯大林和平政策万岁！
    全世界和平万岁！
