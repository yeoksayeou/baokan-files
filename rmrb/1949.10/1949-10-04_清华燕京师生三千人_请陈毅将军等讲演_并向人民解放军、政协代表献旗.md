　　【Beijing News】Yesterday (the 3rd) at 2:00 PM, over three thousand teachers and students from Tsinghua and Yanjing Universities held a CPPCC representative lecture meeting at Tsinghua Square. First, Tsinghua teachers and students presented banners and flowers to the People's Liberation Army and CPPCC representatives. Then, CPPCC representatives General Chen Yi, Li Xiuzhen, and Zhang Xiruo were invited to speak. General Chen Yi hoped that the students would intensify their studies and actively participate in the construction of the new China in the future. He also explained the broad representation of the CPPCC representatives, expressing the great unity of the Chinese people. Li Xiuzhen excitedly reported how she persisted in the struggle against the reactionaries in the countryside and mobilized women to produce and support the front. She also put forward two hopes to the students on behalf of the peasants in the liberated areas: first, to study hard and go to the countryside after graduation to improve the cultural level of the peasants; second, to be pragmatic and stand on the position of the people, and always follow Chairman Mao. The students shouted slogans on the spot, expressing that they would definitely respond to the hopes of the peasants with actions. During the break, many students surrounded her, and a female student, Zhou Qian, pinned her school's commemorative badge on her chest. Finally, Professor Zhang Xiruo spoke, calling on the students to fulfill their responsibilities as masters and study hard.
