Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 18th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru, at the invitation of US President Truman, arrived in Washington on the 11th. The US government accorded Nehru's visit with an extraordinarily solicitous attitude, giving him the "most lavish reception." When Nehru's special plane arrived, Truman and many of his cabinet members personally went to the airport to welcome him. Truman also delivered a welcome speech on the spot, saying, "I hope your visit will also have the significance of discovering America," that is, demanding that Nehru become a thoroughly loyal servant of American imperialism. The newspapers of the American ruling class also tried their best to hype up the news of Nehru's visit to the United States. The New York Times' editorial on the 11th, while praising Nehru, revealed that it hoped Nehru would become a leader in Asia against communism and national liberation movements.

According to Agence France-Presse, citing Washington diplomatic circles, the reason why the US government is so fond of Nehru is because "Truman and Acheson hope that Nehru will contribute to the formulation of a broad plan aimed at stopping the tide of communism in Southeast Asia and can support the US efforts for this purpose." The cable also stated that the main reason Truman hopes Nehru will support this plan is because "there is a sense of hatred among Asians for white people (note: should be read as imperialism), and if Nehru supports this plan, then attacks on American imperialism will be缓和些."

In the four days from the 11th to the 14th, in addition to attending a series of banquets, Nehru held three secret talks with Truman, Acheson, and others, and attended a welcome meeting of the US Congress on the 13th and delivered a long speech. On the 15th, Nehru took US Secretary of Defense Johnson's private plane to New York, beginning his tour of major US cities. In his speech to the US Congress, Nehru not only asked the United States for assistance but also expressed his loyalty to the United States, guaranteeing that he would "not and would not remain neutral" in international affairs.

According to a commentary by the New York Worker's Daily quoted by the Electrical News Agency, Nehru's visit to the United States was because he saw the deep crisis within India itself and was seeking US political support and economic and military assistance. The Worker's Daily continued: "On the one hand, his own mismanaged country spends half of its income on armaments to suppress its own people; on the other hand, it also has to swallow the bait of Truman's 'Point Four' program. And the deceptive conditions of these government-guaranteed loans will only allow American big capital to replace Britain and occupy India."

### 尼赫鲁抵美乞援　杜鲁门政府给以最奢华接待  要他充当美帝最忠实的走狗

　　尼赫鲁抵美乞援
  　杜鲁门政府给以最奢华接待
    要他充当美帝最忠实的走狗
    【新华社北京十八日电】印度总理尼赫鲁，应美总统杜鲁门之邀，于十一日飞抵华盛顿。美国政府对于尼氏这次的访问，以异乎寻常的殷勤态度给以“最奢华的接待”。在尼赫鲁专机到达时，杜鲁门及其阁员多人曾亲至机场欢迎。杜鲁门并当场致欢迎词说：“我希望你的访问也具有发现美国的意义。”就是说，要求尼赫鲁成为美帝国主义澈头澈尾地忠实的臣仆。美国统治阶级的报纸亦竭力渲染尼赫鲁访美的消息。纽约时报十一日社论在吹捧尼赫鲁之余，透露：希望尼氏成为亚洲反对共产主义和民族解放运动的领袖。
    据法新社引华盛顿外交界人士称：美国政府之所以对尼赫鲁如此垂青，是因为“杜鲁门与艾奇逊希望尼赫鲁对于拟定旨在制止东南亚共产主义浪潮的广泛计划，有所贡献，并能支持美国为此目的而进行的努力。”该电又称：杜鲁门希望尼赫鲁支持这一计划的主要理由，是因为“亚洲人之间存在对白种人（按：应读为帝国主义）的仇恨感，如果尼赫鲁支持这一计划，那末，对美国帝国主义的攻击，就会缓和些”。
    在十一日至十四日的四天中，尼赫鲁除了参加一系列的宴会外，曾与杜鲁门，艾奇逊等举行三次秘密会谈，并于十三日出席美国国会的欢迎会，发表长篇的演说。十五日，尼赫鲁乘美国防部长詹森的私人专机，飞抵纽约，开始他在美国各大城市的旅行。尼赫鲁在美国会中的演说，除了要求美国予以援助外，并表明效忠美国，保证在国际事务中“不要也不致保持中立。”
    据电通社引纽约工人日报的评论称：尼赫鲁访美之行，是因为他看到印度自己内部的深刻危机，是为了寻求美国的政治支持和经济军事援助。工人日报继称：“一方面，他自己的管理不善的国家，以一半的收入消耗在镇压本国人民的军备上；另一方面，还要吞咽杜鲁门‘第四点’计划的诱饵。而这种政府保证的贷款的欺骗条件，只会使美国大资本代替英国而盘据在印度。”
