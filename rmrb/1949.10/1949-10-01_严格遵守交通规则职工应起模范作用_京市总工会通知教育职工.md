　　Workers Must Set a Model Example by Strictly Abiding by Traffic Regulations
    Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Issues Notice to Educate Workers
    [This newspaper dispatch] Since the implementation of the "Provisional Traffic Management Rules" in this city, according to materials from the Public Security Bureau, the general situation has been good; however, a small number of factory workers have failed to thoroughly understand traffic regulations, or have intentionally violated them. From September 10th to 16th, there were several instances of factory workers violating traffic regulations. These include: On September 10th, a worker from the 70th Ordnance Factory in Huguosi, Xicheng District, learning to ride a bicycle, took a detour on a small road; on September 11th, a worker from a telecommunications bureau on Xisi North Street rode a bicycle in the fast lane; on September 13th, a cart from the Garment Factory did not follow regulations on Fuyou Street North Intersection and did not listen to dissuasion, and had a bad attitude; on September 14th and 16th, the Third and Fourth Sub-bureaus reported that some workers from the Telecommunications Bureau, the 70th Ordnance Factory, and the Xizhimen Railway Bureau did not observe traffic order during work hours and deliberately violated regulations, or gathered in the center of the road, making it difficult for traffic police to stop them.
    The preparatory committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions has issued a notice to educate all workers that the working class should take the attitude of the master of the country, conscientiously implement the laws and decrees of the People's Government, and set a model role in abiding by traffic rules, establishing and improving urban traffic order, and safeguarding the people's lives and property. It requires the trade unions of each factory to be responsible for carrying out this education.

　　严格遵守交通规则职工应起模范作用
    京市总工会通知教育职工
    【本报讯】本市交通管理暂行规则施行以来，据公安局材料，一般情形良好；但有少数工厂职工对交通规则未能彻底了解，或有意违反。自九月十日至十六日一周间，工厂职工数度发生违反交通规则的事情。计有：九月十日西城护国寺七十兵工厂工友学骑车走小迂回；九月十一日西四北大街一电信局工友骑车走快道；九月十三日被服厂大车在府右街北口未按规章走路，不听制止，态度不好；九月十四日，十六日，内三、四分局反映，电信局、七十兵工厂、西直门铁路局部分职工上下班时，不遵守交通秩序，且有故意违反者，或群集马路中心行走，交通警制止困难。
    市总工会筹委会为此发出通知，教育全体职工要认识工人阶级应以国家主人翁的态度，对人民政府法令首先认真执行，在遵守交通规则，建立与改善城市交通秩序，维护人民生命财产上起模范作用。要求各厂工会负责进行此项教育。
