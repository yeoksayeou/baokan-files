　　Bulgarian Foreign Ministry Sends Letter to the UN
    Protests Provocations by Greek Fascists
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 11th] TASS, New York, September 29th: The United Nations Secretariat announced that Bulgarian Foreign Minister Pop Tomov sent a letter to United Nations Secretary-General Lie, protesting the killing of Bulgarian border guards by the Greek Royalist Fascist army on September 29th. The letter stated: I, on behalf of the Bulgarian government, strongly protest the Greek border guards' acts of infringing on Bulgaria's southern border. We demand that the persons responsible for the killing of the Bulgarian border guards be punished as a warning to others, and that compensation be paid to the families of the deceased. Recently, the Athens government has deliberately and systematically harassed border areas on many occasions. The Bulgarian government believes that these bloody incidents are a new manifestation of the Athens government's aggressive plot and a threat to peace in the Balkans.

　　保外交部致函联合国
    抗议希腊法西斯挑衅
    【新华社北京十一日电】塔斯社纽约九月二十九日讯：联合国秘书处宣布保加利亚外交部长波普托莫夫致函联合国秘书长莱氏，抗议希腊保皇法西斯军于九月二十九日杀害保加利亚边境哨兵。函称：我代表保加利亚政府强硬抗议希腊边防哨侵犯保加利亚南部边疆的行为。要求惩办杀害保加利亚哨兵的负责人以儆效尤，并赔偿死者家属。最近雅典政府蓄意而有系统地侵扰边疆事件屡有发生，保加利亚政府认为这些流血事件乃是雅典政府侵略图谋的新的表现，而且是对巴尔干和平的威胁。
