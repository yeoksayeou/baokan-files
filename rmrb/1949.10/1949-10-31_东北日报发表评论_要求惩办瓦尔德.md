Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, October 28th: The Northeast Daily here published a short commentary on the 25th regarding the unreasonable assault by American citizen Wald (former U.S. Consul General in Shenyang), titled "Punish the Criminal Wald," stating: American citizen Wald (former U.S. Consul General in Shenyang) dared to undermine the laws and regulations of the People's Republic of China by withholding workers' wages and gathering a crowd to beat workers, causing serious injuries. This is truly the most barbaric and tyrannical behavior of the American imperialists. We, the Chinese people, solemnly denounce this atrocity and support the People's Government in giving the criminals, led by Wald, the legal sanctions they deserve.

The Chinese people have already stood up in the form of a giant. The era in which imperialists enjoyed privileges and acted lawlessly in China is gone forever. The Chinese people have their own sacred dignity and will never allow any imperialist to humiliate them again. Whoever dares to humiliate the Chinese people again will certainly be punished by the laws of the People's Republic of China. Since the Chinese people have the power to end imperialist rule in China, they also have the power to punish imperialist elements who dare to run rampant in China.

Wald's assault incident, and the American espionage case recently uncovered in Shenyang, profoundly tell us that American imperialism is determined to be enemies with the Chinese people to the end. They are never reconciled to their failure in China and are using various methods to engage in restoration, secret sabotage, and open provocations. All kinds of vile and shameless means will be used. We must be highly vigilant against their various sinister and shameless conspiracies and crush them at any time.

    要求惩办瓦尔德
    【新华社沈阳二十八日电】此间东北日报于二十五日就美侨瓦尔德无理行凶事，以“惩办凶犯瓦尔德”为题，发表短评称：在沈美国侨民瓦尔德（前美国驻沈总领事），胆敢破坏中华人民共和国的法纪，克扣工人工资，并聚众殴打工人，以至重伤，这实在是美帝国主义者最野蛮最横暴的行为。我们中国人民严正控诉这种暴行，并拥护人民政府给予以瓦尔德为首的凶犯们以应得的法律制裁。
    中国人民已经以巨人的姿态站起来了，帝国主义者在中国享受特权、为非作歹的时代，已经一去不复返了。中国人民有自己神圣的尊严，绝不允许任何帝国主义能再来欺辱。谁敢再来欺辱中国人民，谁就一定受到中华人民共和国的法律惩罚。中国人民既然有力量结束了帝国主义在中国的统治，那么也就有力量来惩办敢在中国境内横行霸道的帝国主义分子。
    瓦尔德的行凶事件，和不久之前沈阳破获的美国特务事件，深刻地告诉了我们：美帝国主义决心与中国人民为敌到底，它们决不甘心于在中国的失败，而在用各种方法从事复辟，秘密的破坏，公开的挑衅，各种卑劣无耻的手段，都会用得出来的。对于它们各种毒辣无耻的阴谋，我们必须提高警惕，并且随时予以粉碎。
