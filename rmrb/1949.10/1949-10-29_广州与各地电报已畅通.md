Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 28th - The Guangzhou Municipal Telecommunications Management Office of the Sixth District of the former Ministry of Communications, the Guangzhou Telecommunications Bureau, and the Guangzhou Automatic Telephone Exchange have been taken over by personnel appointed by the Guangzhou Military Control Commission. All telegram, telephone, and other services have been restored successively. Telegrams between Guangzhou and all liberated areas of the country are now unobstructed. Wired telegrams within Guangdong Province can reach Qujiang, Yingde, Nanhai, Qingyuan, and other places; wireless telegrams can reach Xingning and Shanwei. The automatic telephone system in the urban area has never stopped working. The automatic telephone exchange has 9,600 telephone sets, most of which are intact. The Huangsha cable of the long-distance telephone line, which was destroyed by bandits and special agents, has been repaired. The 50 pairs of overhead cables on Haizhu Bridge were destroyed by bombing and will not be easily repaired in the short term. Existing underwater cables can be used, and partial telephone service began on the 25th. Wired long-distance telephone lines have been opened to Qujiang, Dayu, Nanxiong, Ganzhou, Lechang, Yingde, Qingyuan, Nanhai, and other places. Wireless telephone lines have been opened to Changsha, and trial connections between Shanghai and Guangzhou have been made. Nanjing, Hankou, Fuzhou, Xi'an, Beijing, and other places will also be able to make calls soon.
