Xinhua News Agency, Central China Front, 18th Dispatch: A frontline reporter's comprehensive report on the Hengyang-Baoqing (i.e., Shaoyang) Campaign states: Before the People's Liberation Army on the Central China Front launched this powerful offensive, the remnant Chiang Kai-shek and Bai Chongxi bandits, supported by American imperialism, were still attempting to use Hengyang, a strategic base in South China, as a hub for their desperate resistance. They relied on the Xiangjiang, ＠ River, and Yongle River to the east, and the Zi River to the west, setting up two lines of defense, concentrating their "elite" troops on the Hengbao line between the Xiang and Zi Rivers, vainly hoping to prevent the advance of the People's Liberation Army.

After our army launched a powerful autumn offensive, the central army, on the 3rd of this month, launched a huge pincer attack on the Bai bandit's nest, Hengyang, in two lines with overwhelming force. The western line of our central army, after two days and nights of forced march, raided and annihilated the bandit troops along the Yongfeng, Xinqiao, and Baiguoshi line. The remnant bandits launched a counter-attack along the Xiangtan-Baoqing highway and the west side of Mount Heng, but our army immediately gave them a head-on blow, forcing the bandits to retreat and defend the Hengyang-Baoqing (Shaoyang) line. At that time, the eastern line of our central army also quickly broke through the right flank of the bandit army's defenses in the Heng-Bao area, occupied Yongxing City on the 5th, cut off the Yuehan Railway, and threatened the bandit army's flank. On the 7th, the eastern and western lines of our central army launched a general offensive, breaking through the Hengbao line in one fell swoop. The bandit army immediately fell into complete chaos and retreated in a disarray. Our army immediately launched a full-scale pursuit, using swift movements to penetrate deep behind enemy lines, seizing the enemy's main force, and encircling them. By the morning of the 9th, the main force of the Bai bandits, the 7th Army Headquarters and its 171st Division, 172nd Division, and the 176th Division and 138th Division of the 48th Army, were completely cut off and surrounded in the Wufeng Mountain area north of Qiyang. After the four divisions of the Bai bandits' main force were surrounded, our various armies worked together to attack the enemy, shrinking the encirclement. The enemy was cut into several pieces, and the enemy troops fled desperately, but there was no way to escape the net cast by the People's Liberation Army. After four days of fierce fighting, by 10:00 a.m. on the 11th, the four divisions of the Bai bandits' main force were finally completely annihilated. The People's Liberation Army also captured the bandit chief, Ling Yunshang, the deputy commander of the 7th Army, and three division commanders during a large-scale search of the mountains. Hengyang, Baoqing, and other cities were subsequently liberated.

After the annihilation of the main force of the Bai bandits, the entire bandit army was shaken and its morale collapsed. The 62nd Division of the 14th Army, which belonged to the bandit Huang Jie's army, which had fled to the Shixiajiang area southwest of Baoqing, was annihilated by our troops returning from Zhijiang to the east on the 12th and 13th. The 1st Division of the bandit New 8th Army at Gaoshashi, west of Shixiajiang, surrendered on the 14th. The Hengbao Campaign thus came to an end.

During this campaign, the commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army all vowed to "celebrate the founding of the People's Republic of China by annihilating the remnant Chiang and Bai bandits." Their morale was extremely high, and countless heroic examples emerged during the battle. For example, a certain division advanced 160 miles in 21 hours of continuous forced march, unexpectedly wedging into the Lingguandian area southwest of Hengyang, seizing the main force of the Bai bandits fleeing south; and with a courageous and tenacious spirit, resolutely blocked and intercepted the retreating and fleeing enemy, repelling the bandit army's many desperate attempts to break through, and annihilating the 172nd Division headquarters and two entire regiments through continuous counter-attacks. Another example is that a certain division swept away the obstruction of the bandit troops at Jingtoujiang with two days and nights of fierce pursuit, crossed Wufeng Mountain and advanced 160 miles, cutting off and sealing off the enemy's retreat in the Yangjiaqiao area; and fought fiercely with the enemy, which was twice our size, for one day and one night, repelling more than ten attacks by the enemy, and the position remained unshaken. After a large amount of ammunition was consumed, they also launched a heroic counter-attack, annihilating the 171st Division headquarters, two entire regiments, and parts of the 7th Army headquarters and the 176th Division. Another example is that dozens of brave fighters from a certain regiment swam across the Zi River for fifteen minutes under the enemy's intensive artillery fire on the afternoon of the 6th, seized the enemy's boats, and captured the position, covering the entire corps' crossing of the Zi River in one hour. These incomparably heroic battles played a great role in this encirclement and annihilation battle, and were commended by a circular from the corps leaders.

  　华中衡宝战役经过
    【新华社华中前线十八日电】前线记者综合报道衡（阳）、宝（庆）（即邵阳）战役的经过称：华中前线人民解放军此次发动强大攻势前，在美帝国主义支持下的蒋白残匪犹妄图以华南战略基地衡阳作为负隅挣扎的枢纽，东依湘江、＠水、永乐江，西凭资水布置两条防御线，集中其“精锐”部队于湘、资两江间之衡宝线，妄想阻止人民解放军大军前进。
    我军发动强大的秋季攻势后，中路大军即于本月三日以排山倒海之势分两线向白匪巢穴衡阳举行巨大钳形攻击。中路西线我军经两昼夜强行军，奔袭歼灭永丰、新桥、白果市一线匪军，残匪则沿湘潭、宝庆公路与南岳西侧，向我反攻，我军当即予以迎头痛击，匪被迫退守衡阳、宝庆（邵阳）一线。其时，中路东线我军亦迅速突破匪军衡、宝地区的右侧防线，于五日占领永兴城，截断粤汉路，威胁匪军侧冀。七日，我中路东西两线大军发起总攻，一举突破衡宝线，匪军立即全线混乱，狼狈溃退。我军当即发起全线追击，以神速动作，猛插敌后，抓住敌军主力，迂回包围，至九日晨，乃将白匪主力第七军军部及其一七一师、一七二师、与四十八军之一七六师、一三八师，完全截断包围于祁阳以北之五峰山地区。白匪主力四个师被包围后，我各路大军齐心协力，向敌合击，缩小包围圈。将敌割裂成为数块，敌军狠奔豕突，但丝毫也没有办法逃脱人民解放军撒下的天罗地网。经四日激战，至十一日十时，白匪主力四个师终于被全部消灭。解放军并在大举搜山中擒获匪首第七军副军长凌云上和三个师长。衡阳、宝庆等城亦即相继获得解放。
    白匪主力就歼后，匪军全线震动，军心瓦解。其流窜至宝庆西南石下江地区之匪黄杰兵团所部十四军六十二师，十二、十三两日又为我由芷江方面回师东进之部队一举歼灭。其在石下江以西高沙市之匪新八军第一师，则于十四日来降。衡宝战役至此乃告一段落。
    此次战役中，解放军指战员均誓以“歼灭蒋白残匪来庆祝中华人民共和国的成立”，士气万分高涨，战斗中涌现无数英勇范例。如某师以二十一小时的连续急行军前进一百六十里，出敌不意地楔入衡阳西南的灵官殿地区，抓住了南逃的白匪主力；并以勇猛顽强的精神，坚决堵击与截击退却逃跑之敌，击退匪军多次拼死的突围冲锋，以连续的反击，歼匪一七二师师部及两个整团。又如某师以两昼夜猛追，扫除了井头江匪军的阻挠，越过五峰山前进一百六十里，于杨家桥地区截断与封闭了敌军的退路；并与两倍于我的匪军激战一昼夜，击退敌人十余次的攻击，阵地屹然不动。在弹药大量消耗后还英勇反击，歼敌一七一师师部、两个团全部和第七军军部及一七六师各一部。再如某团的几十位神勇战士，六日下午在敌人的紧密炮火下，经十五分钟游泳，泅过资江，夺取了敌人的船只，抢占了阵地，掩护兵团在一小时内全部渡过资江。这些无比英勇的战斗，对这次围歼战，都起了很大的作用，荣获了兵团首长的通令表扬。
