　　How the Soviet Union Established the System of State Supervision
    By Meihelisi, Translated by He Ge

　　I.
    The history of socialist state supervision clearly illustrates how the Lenin-Stalin Party flexibly led the state management organs, taking into account the different environments and characteristics of each stage of socialist construction.
    After the Russian working class seized power through the victory of the October Revolution, it destroyed the exploitative state apparatus, and the old bourgeois bureaucratic institutions were fundamentally overthrown and purged. The young Soviet state faced new tasks: to organize the state's economy on a basis fundamentally different from that under capitalism, and to establish new social relations in production and distribution, which were created by the confiscation of the property of capitalists and landlords.
    The victorious proletariat did not have enough cadres with experience in managing the state and leading the various sectors of the national economy. At that time, the most urgent task was to practically grasp the executive organs, democratize them, and teach state organs to lead them flexibly, thereby truly ruling the country.
    Under such conditions, Comrade Stalin paid special attention to accumulating experience in socialist construction through the supervision organs, in order to systematically introduce this experience to young cadres. In a report to Lenin from the Party Central Committee and the Defense Council on January 31, 1919, regarding the reasons for the fall of the city of Perm, Stalin and Dzerzhinsky noted that a large number of absolutely upright, loyal, and steadfast workers made mistakes in their work due to lack of experience. “If the Soviet regime had a special body to accumulate the experience of socialist construction and introduce it to those young workers eager to assist the proletariat, then the construction of socialist Russia would be faster and more stable.”
    The question of organizing socialist supervision became urgent. However, the People's Commissariat of State Supervision was being controlled by a group of corrupt and mostly reactionary Tsarist officials. This kind of supervision was detached from the boiling revolutionary life, carrying a superficial, completely formalistic, and bureaucratic nature. Therefore, of course, it could not guide anyone, nor could it produce anything. Under the extremely difficult conditions of the Civil War and the national economy, such supervision only created piles of waste paper, deviated from pressing practical problems, and, in fact, hindered all revolutionary plans. Such a supervision mechanism did not gain, and could not gain, any trust or prestige among the masses. Comrade Stalin said: "This is the only organ that has not yet undergone the purge and reform that all other organs have undergone. In order to achieve real, effective, and not just on paper, supervision, it is necessary to reorganize the existing state supervision organs by injecting new forces."
    The situation of supervision work in the Soviet Republic was the subject of discussion at the Eighth Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks), which in its resolution demanded "the establishment of a real and effective system of supervision of a socialist nature." The question arose: who would undertake this arduous work, who could solve the task of supervising and organizing Soviet work in the complex military environment and under conditions of economic chaos, who could lead the work of purging Soviet organs, eradicating bureaucracy, thereby helping the Party to firmly advance the cause of socialist construction.
    The great leader and founder of the Soviet state, Lenin, believed that there was no better candidate than Comrade Stalin, and that the heavy responsibility of reorganizing and leading the State Supervision Department should be entrusted to him. At that time, Comrade Stalin was the People's Commissar for Nationalities Affairs, a member of the Politburo and the Organizational Bureau of the Party Central Committee, and had been staying on the front lines of the Civil War. When, later, at the Eleventh Party Congress, the Trotskyites attempted to weaken the most important supervision weapon in the hands of the Party and raised the so-called difficulty for Comrade Stalin to manage two departments concurrently, Lenin said: "We need a person who can be approached by representatives of any nationality to explain the details of the matter. Where to find such a person?" Lenin then answered: "There is no one else but Comrade Stalin." Lenin gave the same answer regarding Stalin's work in state supervision: "The work is arduous. But to handle the inspection work well, it is necessary to have a person with prestige to lead it, otherwise we will fall into despicable conspiracies."
    On April 3, 1919, at a meeting of the Council of People's Commissars presided over by Lenin, the draft "State Supervision Law" prepared by Comrade Stalin was discussed. This was a plan to destroy supervision that existed only on paper, bureaucratic supervision, and to put it on the path of socialism. Lenin made many supplementary comments on this draft, as can be seen from the notes exchanged between Lenin and Stalin at the meeting of the Council of People's Commissars. In a note to Stalin, Lenin wrote that supervision mechanisms involving worker participation should be established, and that conscious elements from the proletariat and two-thirds women should be systematically involved in this work. First, prompt inspections should be carried out based on accusations from the people, and revolutionary measures should be taken to combat waste and stagnation. Special attention needs to be paid to increasing labor productivity and increasing production.
    At the bottom of this note, Stalin replied to Lenin: "These are policy issues for the reorganized State Supervision Department. I have no objection to these points; on the contrary, they are necessary. Stalin."
    On April 9, 1919, at the plenary session of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee, the "State Supervision Law" was discussed and unanimously adopted based on Stalin's report, and signed by Lenin, Stalin, and Kalinin. At this meeting, Stalin pointed out in his report that the main purpose of reorganizing the State Supervision organs was to democratize them and bring them closer to the worker and peasant masses. To make the State Supervision Department an institution of the people, accessible to the broad masses of workers and peasants, and to absorb them into the work of building a new life through supervision - this is the task that the State Supervision organs must solve. This order from Lenin and Stalin on April 9, 1919, laid the foundation for organizing a truly people's, socialist State Supervision Department.
    The organization of socialist supervision is inseparable from the name of Stalin. Stalin launched intense activities to fundamentally transform the State Supervision organs and make them worker-oriented. A fresh, Bolshevik spirit of party loyalty and principle permeated the supervision work. The old style of Tsarist supervision - numb formalism, servility and fear towards superiors, flattery and sycophancy towards the powerful - was eradicated from the root. The State Supervision Department became a tool for the Party and the Soviet government in the struggle to Bolshevize the management organs. The personnel organization of the State Supervision Department underwent a thorough purge. Workers and peasants, many of whom were Communists, entered the newly established State Supervision Department.
    It is not easy to describe the enormous work that the State Supervision Department did at that time and the depth of the new style brought about by Comrade Stalin. Let us quote a document of profound significance, a document sent on May 7, 1919 (less than a month after the enactment of the decree reorganizing the State Supervision Department) to the special inspector of the city of Shchigry:
    "To the Special Inspector of the State Supervision Department of Shchigry City:
    In studying the causes of peasant disturbances, in addition to studying the consistent political mood of the peasant masses in the county, please pay attention to:
    (1) The policies of the Land Bureau and the State Farm Management Office in organizing Soviet agriculture: whether there are improper acts of requisitioning peasant land to organize Soviet agriculture; whether there are other compulsory acts that seriously affect the economic conditions of peasants.
    (2) The policies of the Land Bureau in organizing collective agriculture: whether there are compulsory factors in organizing agricultural communes, agricultural cooperatives, joint farming groups, etc.; whether the organization of collective agriculture has caused damage to the interests of local peasants.
    (3) The policies of the Sugar Trust in nationalizing the land of sugar beet plantations: whether the implementation of nationalization has damaged the basic interests of peasants; whether the nationalized land has caused difficulties for peasants in using the land; whether there are other behaviors that may cause peasant dissatisfaction (for example, sugar factories occupy a land area far exceeding their actual needs; nationalizing land that has not been planted with sugar beets before, etc.).
    (4) And the following questions: whether the peasant disturbances are the result of too little land in the area; whether the land of non-laboring elements is allocated to peasants for use, and under what conditions; whether the activities of the county Land Bureau or its individual representatives, or the activities of various village Land Bureaus, have caused peasant dissatisfaction due to non-compliance with central orders, and whether the authorities have a tendency towards incompetence or abuse.
    Upon receiving this telegram, please telegraph back to the State Supervision Department about the measures taken.
    　　　　　　People's Commissar of the State Supervision Department Stalin
    　　　　　　　　　　　May 7, 1919"
    Such documents provided the staff of the State Supervision Department with political guidance, taught them to solve political problems from the Party's standpoint, and educated them in the spirit of Lenin and Stalin's concern for the people. Whether the interests of peasants were damaged in organizing collective agriculture, whether there were compulsory factors, what the policies of the Sugar Trust were, whether the nationalized land caused difficulties for peasants in using the land, etc. - these sharp political questions were very clearly and explicitly posed to the state supervisors.
    In this small document, one can see the complete political program for the struggle for Lenin's line within the Party. Comrade Stalin constantly raised the issue of correctly implementing the Party's policy towards peasants throughout the period of socialist construction. When you read Comrade Stalin's telegram, you naturally think of the stage of the Bolshevik Party's arduous struggle to transform the individual peasant economy and put it on the path of socialism, and of Stalin's theory of agricultural collectivization.
    A year later - in February 1920 - the State Supervision Department was reorganized into the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection Department. On the basis of more broadly absorbing workers and peasants to participate in supervision and inspection work, a unified institution of socialist supervision was established in the central and local levels. The task of the reorganized supervision department was to strengthen the struggle against bureaucracy, against stagnation, reporting falsehoods, and numb tendencies, and to inspect and study the work of the Soviet regime's institutions in administrative management and economic aspects.
    The supervision work took on a truly national character, and workers and peasants learned to manage the country's work through the Supervision Department. In a letter about the tasks of the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection Department, Lenin wrote: "The task of the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection Department - not only, or rather not so much to 'uncover', 'hunt down', but rather to be good at correcting."
    It was necessary to make the staff of the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection Department aware of the new position and to recognize their tasks. In this regard, a conference of responsible workers of the All-Russian Workers' and Peasants' Inspection Department was convened on October 15, 1920, with the support of Comrade Stalin.
    Comrade Stalin's speech at this meeting provided a profound analysis of the state of the state organs and the tasks facing the state, and explained the methods of socialist supervision work. Stalin put forward two basic tasks for the staff of the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection Department:
    The first task was for supervision workers to assist the central and local responsible comrades in establishing the most appropriate method of accounting for state property and establishing appropriate accounting methods, and to assist in rectifying supply organs, institutions for both peacetime and wartime, and economic institutions.
    "The second basic task is for the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection Department to cultivate leaders from among the workers and peasants in the course of its work who are sufficient to grasp the entire state apparatus."
    The guiding principle for the reorganization of the Supervision Department was to accumulate the experience of socialist construction with new forces and to assist the worker and peasant cadres in various sectors of the national economy. This required further changes in the methods and forms of supervision and inspection work, and required a firm strengthening of the supervisory functions of our various organs.
    Stalin was well aware of the difficulties in the work of the supervisors, of the hostility of individual old bureaucrats towards the loyal staff of the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection Department, and of the difficulties caused by bureaucrats in concealing errors in the work of the organs they led. Regarding these difficulties and dangers for the supervisors, Stalin said: "But the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection Department does not need to be afraid of these. It should keep in mind a basic rule: do not pity individuals, no matter what positions they occupy, only pity the matter, pity the interests of the work."
    This All-Russian Conference chaired by Stalin was a large-scale political education school for the staff of the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection Department. Comrade Stalin's speech is still carefully studied and learned by supervision workers today. What should a state supervisor be like, what qualities should he possess - the answer to this urgent question can be found in this programmatic speech: a state supervisor should have great patience, impeccable purity, loyalty, fairness, and Bolshevik principles. Comrade Stalin repeatedly pointed out that the staff of the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection Department "should be pure, irreproachable, and impartial. The reason for this is that they have not only the formal, but also the spiritual right to supervise others and teach others."
    Comrade Stalin served as the People's Commissar of the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection Department for three years, until April 1922, when, according to Lenin's proposal, he was elected as the General Secretary of the Party Central Committee. During this period, socialist supervision was the Party's loyal assistant, doing enormous work in inspecting various sectors of the national economy, in fighting against the uneconomical use and waste of materials, especially the waste of grain, and in improving the organs of power. The People's Commissariat of Workers' and Peasants' Inspection became the center for accumulating experience in socialist construction. At the same time, it should be pointed out that another important achievement of the People's Commissariat of Workers' and Peasants' Inspection was that it became a practical school where workers and peasants, on the one hand, participated in supervision and inspection work, and on the other hand, learned how to work better and how to govern the country.

　　II.
    After the end of the Civil War, the Bolshevik Party immediately engaged in restoring the destroyed national economy. The transition from war communism to the New Economic Policy rapidly and greatly improved agriculture. But at the same time, distortions and speculative tendencies of the New Economic Policy shook parts of the state apparatus. Lenin focused on improving the state management organs, establishing truly socialist organs, reducing expenditures, fighting against various wastes and abuses, and strictly saving to develop large-scale machine industry and national electrification. At that time, the issue of consolidating the worker-peasant alliance under the leadership of the proletariat was particularly sharply raised.
    The new stage of socialist construction required reorganizing the domestic supervision organs, changing their working methods, and increasing new forces. The work of this supervision organ had to be very flexible, infiltrating every corner and intervening in all central and local state organs. Lenin linked our general work plan, the Party's policy and its strategic and tactical plans, with the task of reorganizing and merging the Central Control Commission and the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection Department. On the eve of the opening of the Twelfth Party Congress, when he was confined to his sickbed, he wrote two articles: "How We Should Reorganize the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection Department" and "Better Fewer, But Better."
    Lenin demanded that the best talents be concentrated in the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection Department, not seeking quantity but quality, and selecting particularly skilled and specially tested people so that they could gain universal trust.
    In the report of the Twelfth Party Central Committee, Comrade Stalin fully agreed with Lenin's proposal to merge the Central Control Commission and the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection Department. In explaining the issue of the Party and state organs, Stalin specifically pointed out that this part of the report was directly related to Lenin's two famous articles mentioned above. The Party wanted to make the state organs an effective tool serving the people, not a mere formality. "The policy is correct," the report pointed out, "the driver is excellent, the machine model is very good, it is Soviet-style, but the constituent parts of this state machine, that is, the individual workers in the state organs, are not good, not our own people." Therefore, the correct political line was distorted. The reorganized Central Control Commission and the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection Department must ensure the unity within the Party and become an important tool for transforming all components of the state organs. Stalin pointed out that this reorganization was to "ensure that there will no longer be an official in our country who is pointed at by the people as unreasonable, even the highest-ranking official."
    The Congress demanded that the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection Department be transformed into a model institution closely linked to the Party. Among the tasks of the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection Department, it was proposed to investigate the leadership work of economic and management organs according to a predetermined plan and to prevent corruption in individual economic sectors. The Congress paid special attention to improving those economic and management organs that were directly related to the people. The Congress demanded that "Soviet officials who are arrogant and despise the demands of workers and peasants" be severely punished.
    Thus, the Party entered a tense stage of struggle for socialist industrialization. At the Leningrad Party Congress in April 1926, Comrade Stalin severely criticized those leaders who casually violated laws and squandered state resources. He particularly solemnly raised the task of strictly adhering to economic principles and demanded that "not a penny of the people's property be wasted," so that every penny could be used for the needs of national industrialization. After this speech, Stalin and Kuibyshev, on behalf of the Central Committee and the Central Control Commission, demanded that party organizations and economic workers at all levels fight against waste and uneconomical practices and regard such facts as acts of crime against the working class.
    The joint institution of the Central Control Commission and the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection Department gained great prestige, played a huge role in domestic life, and became a powerful weapon of the Party. The outstanding leaders who successively led the Central Control Commission and the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection Department included Kuibyshev, Ordzhonikidze, and Andreyev. The joint institution of the Central Control Commission and the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection Department assisted the Party in fighting against bureaucracy, against stagnation, exaggeration, and all waste and overlapping of work, and purged all unsuitable personnel from the Soviet institutions. Ordzhonikidze did not answer the slanderers without reason at the Fifteenth Party Congress: "The Soviet institutions are in our hands, they serve our socialist motherland, and they - are our institutions now."

　　III.
    The Stalin Five-Year Plans played a particularly important role in the cause of national industrialization. The industrial level of 1913 had long been exceeded, and far exceeded. New heavy industrial sectors appeared, and new industrial centers were established on barren land. By the time of the Seventeenth Party Congress - 1934 - the domestic political and economic situation had fundamentally changed. In the national economy, socialist components occupied a dominant position. The crisis of division within the Party had long passed. The anti-Lenin hostile groups - agents of foreign spies - were crushed. The joint institution such as the Central Control Commission and the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection Department was no longer needed. The stage of supervising the entire state management organs and economic organs by one center was no longer suitable for newer tasks. Now, the issue of personnel being individually responsible for their work departments, as well as checking the implementation of the Party and government resolutions, was brought to the forefront. Stalin pointed out at the Seventeenth Party Congress, "Now what we need is no longer supervision, but checking the implementation of central resolutions - now we need to supervise the implementation of central resolutions."
    The Soviet Supervision Committee established in accordance with the Congress's resolution focused its main goal on checking the implementation of government resolutions, and this task was successfully completed. However, the rapid growth of our economy showed that this form of supervision was insufficient. The supervision of the calculation and expenditure of state funds and materials was particularly lagging behind.
    In 1940, based on Comrade Stalin's proposal, the People's Commissariat of State Supervision of the Soviet Union was established on the basis of the Soviet Supervision Committee. Its task was to supervise the expenditure and calculation of state funds and materials, as well as to check the implementation of government resolutions. The main working method of the State Supervision Department was the documentary inspection of the economic and financial activities of various enterprises, organizations, and departments.
    During the Great Patriotic War, the work of the State Supervision Department focused on the operational inspection of military supplies and the defense industry. Engaged in the universal patriotic enthusiasm of the Soviet people, the supervision staff worked selflessly to ensure the victory over the fascist enemy.
    The war and the post-war period have repeatedly shown the great advantages of the socialist planned economy. When those capitalist countries that suffered minor war damage were stagnant, the Soviet Union had already exceeded the pre-war level of industrial production by the end of the third year of the post-war Five-Year Plan. In these years, socialist agriculture also achieved great achievements. Comrade Stalin described our huge work plans for a longer period in the future at the election meeting in February 1946. Stalin said that during the recent three Five-Year Plans, we want to achieve that the Soviet Union's industry can produce 50 million tons of iron, 60 million tons of steel, 500 million tons of coal, and 60 million tons of oil annually. This is truly an unprecedented great plan that will ensure the establishment of a communist society and enable the Soviet Union to avoid all accidents. The State Supervision Department will use special methods unique to it to strive for the realization of this great plan.
    The socialist State Supervision Department has undergone different organizational changes in the thirty years since its establishment, but it has always been a powerful weapon for the Party and the government to check the implementation of their resolutions.
    Under the conditions of struggling for a communist society, the role of the state and the function of its economic organization are constantly growing. Consolidating and improving state organs, improving political discipline in all links, and increasing the sense of responsibility of every worker for their work - this is the task of the Soviet supervision staff.
    Comrade Stalin's issue of the need to save every penny of the people to further develop the economy, to practice strict economy, and to eliminate all waste and abuse of state money has been raised with new strength.
    Many reserve forces sufficient to rapidly develop our economy have not yet been discovered. The leaders of individual enterprises often conceal productivity, use tricks when formulating plans, and do not make special efforts to complete and exceed plans. Exposing such tricks - is the glorious work of state supervisors. Unfortunately, we are still very backward in this regard.
    Saving materials in production and not discarding materials - this can also rapidly improve our economy. But the results of our inspection of enterprises show that this aspect is not done well enough. Supervisors must learn to calculate materials not only in large numbers - tons, but also in small numbers - grams.
    Striving for a real reduction in production costs and for an accurate accounting system - this cannot be left off the supervision staff's agenda. Artificially increasing production costs makes it easy for the leaders of some enterprises to complete the plan to reduce costs without having to mobilize the masses to improve the quality of work.
    To protect the property of the people, the accounting system in various enterprises must be sound, and the accounting organs should not specifically fabricate figures for the economic leaders. Supervisors must pay special attention to this department's work.
    The Party and the government demand to improve the quality of various products. Our industry can produce the best goods and the best machines in the world. The issue lies in a loyal attitude towards work and in being responsible for the quality of goods. The State Supervision Department should engage in more work in this area.
    Comrade Stalin said: "Excellent examination of the implementation of work - this is a searchlight that helps us understand the situation of the organs' work at any time and exposes bureaucrats and formalists." The Party Central Committee and the government are today striving to accelerate the development of the national economy, striving to increase the latest technology in production, and striving to improve the people's happiness. Regularly and deeply checking the implementation of government resolutions - this is the direct obligation of the State Supervision Department.
    The State Supervision organs can now conduct large-scale and in-depth inspections of complex economic and technical production issues. Among the supervision staff, there are experts in various sectors of the national economy, and there are many highly educated and experienced talents.
    The State Supervision Department and its staff must fight against bureaucratic tendencies in solving political problems at all times. The State Supervision Department must first evaluate various facts and phenomena from the standpoint of the entire country, from the viewpoint of legality and appropriateness. For the supervision staff, the interests of the country are above all else. No matter what department the supervision worker is in, he must not stand on a local standpoint, and he must not be affected by any department or individual. Close contact with the Party organs during inspections and reviews can eliminate these errors of the supervision staff.
    The entire State Supervision organs and every supervision worker must implement the Party's line at all times and everywhere, be absolutely fair, and be 100% objective and honest in summarizing the inspection work, and must not be biased, false, or dishonest. The supervision staff should remove any prejudice and always remember Comrade Stalin's instructions: "To investigate figures with some prejudice is to commit a criminal offense."
    We must greatly improve the general cultural level and political level of the supervision staff and educate them in the spirit of Lenin and Stalin. The complexity of the supervision work requires us to solemnly cultivate supervision workers so that they can avoid errors in their work. We must achieve, as Lenin and Stalin demanded, that the supervision staff is composed of educated and trustworthy people, "who do not lose faith in a word and do not violate conscience in a word." The state has entrusted the State Supervision Department with the heavy responsibility of examining the Soviet institutions and examining the Soviet staff. This greatly increases the responsibility of the supervision staff. Our task is to not fail the trust of the people, the trust of the Party Central Committee and the government, and the trust of Comrade Stalin.
    Note (1): State supervision was originally an inspection of whether the expenditure of state funds was legitimate or not. In bourgeois countries, state supervision organs are limited to checking the formal correctness of expenditures and their documentary reimbursement. In the early days of the Soviet October Revolution, state supervision organs also mostly had this nature. It was not until 1920, after the State Supervision Department was reorganized into the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection Department, that a thorough change took place. Now, in the Soviet Union, the formal supervision function, that is, the inspection of the legality and correctness of expenditures, is the responsibility of the People's Commissariat of Finance, while the supervision of the economic appropriateness and rationality of expenditures, and even the supervision of the work of the entire state organs, is entrusted to the People's Commissariat of Workers' and Peasants' Inspection.

　　苏联是怎样确立国家监察制度的
    梅赫里斯  著  何歌  译
  　一
    社会主义的国家监察（一）的历史，清楚说明了列宁——斯大林党是如何灵活地领导着国家管理机构，估计到社会主义建设的每一阶段的不同环境与特点。
    俄国工人阶级由于十月革命的胜利而掌握政权后，摧毁了剥削性的国家机构，旧的资产阶级官僚机构被根本推翻和肃清了。年青的苏维埃国家面临着新的任务——要在与资本主义条件下根本不同的基础上组织国家的经济，在生产和分配方面树立新的社会关系，这种关系是由于没收资本家和地主的财产而造成的。
    获得胜利的无产阶级，没有足够的在管理国家和领导国民经济各部门方面经验丰富的干部。而当时最迫切的任务就是要实际上掌握执行机关，使它民主化，要教导国家机关，灵活地领导它，从而真正的统治国家。
    在这样的条件下，斯大林同志特别重视通过监察机构来积蓄社会主义建设的经验，以便把这些经验有系统地介绍给青年干部们，在一九一九年一月三十一日党中央和国防会议给列宁的关于贝尔姆城陷落原因的报告中，斯大林和捷尔静斯基都注意到，大批绝对正直的、忠诚的、坚定的工作人员所以在工作中放任错误，是由于缺乏经验的缘故。“如果苏维埃政权有一个专门机构，来积蓄社会主义建设的经验，并把他（经验）介绍给那些年青的、热望协助无产阶级的工作人员，那末，社会主义俄国的建设将快得多和稳得多”。
    组织社会主义监察的问题，成为急不待缓的了。然而，国家监察人民委员部却正被那批腐旧的、大多数是反动的沙皇官吏们掌握着，这种监察是与沸腾的革命生活脱节的，带着浮而不实的、完全形式主义的、官僚主义的性质。因此，当然不能指导任何人，也指导不出什么。在内战和国民经济非常困难的条件下，这样的监察只是制造出一堆堆的废纸，脱离了迫切的实际问题，并且事实上阻挠了一切革命的计划。这样的监察机构在人民大众间没有获得，也不能获得任何信任，更不必说威信了。斯大林同志说过：“这是唯一至今还没有受到那种其他一切机关都经过的整肃与改革的机关。为了要做到真正的、切实的、而非纸上的监察，必需用注入新生力量的方法来改组现有的国家监察机构。”
    苏维埃共和国的监察工作情况，是第八届俄国共产党（布）大会的讨论对象，这次大会在决议中要求“建立真正的、切实的社会主义性质的监察制度。”问题发生了——谁来担负这桩艰巨的工作，谁能够在复杂的军事环境中，在经济混乱的条件中解决监察与组织苏维埃工作的任务，谁能够领导整肃苏维埃机关的工作，革除官僚主义，从而帮助党坚定地推进社会主义建设事业。
    伟大的领袖和苏维埃国家的创立者列宁，认为没有比斯大林同志更好的人选了，应该把改组和领导国家监察部的重任交给他。这时，斯大林同志是民族事务人民委员长，党中央政治局和组织局委员，一直留在内战的前线。当后来，在第十一届党大会上托洛茨基分子企图削弱党手中的最重要的监察武器，而提出所　谓斯大林同志难以一身兼管两部工作时，列宁说道：“我们需要一个人，使任何民族的代表都可以去找他详细讲述事情的原委。哪儿去找这样的人呢？”列宁接着回答道：“除了斯大林同志，没有别人。”对于斯大林在国家监察方面的工作，列宁也给以同样的答复：“工作是艰巨的。但是要好好处理检查的工作，就必须一个有威信的人来领导，否则我们将陷入卑劣的阴谋中。”
    在一九一九年四月三日列宁主持的人民委员长会议上，讨论了斯大林同志所拟的“国家监察法”草案。这是摧毁纸上的、官僚的监察，使它走上社会主义道路的计划。列宁对这草案提出了许多补充意见，还可以从列宁和斯大林在人民委员长会议席上交换的字条中看出来。在给斯大林的字条上列宁写道，应该建立工人参加的监察机构，有计划地让无产阶级中的觉悟分子和三分之二的妇女来参加这项工作。首先，要根据各民的控告来实行迅速的检查，采取革命的措施来和浪费及呆滞斗争。特别需要注意提高劳动生产率和增加生产量。
    在这张字条的下端，斯大林答列宁道：“这是改组后的国家监察部的政策问题，我对这几点毫无异议，相反，它们是必要的。斯大林。”
    一九一九年四月九日，全俄中央执行委员会全体大会上根据斯大林的报告讨论了并且一致通过了“国家监察法”，由列宁、斯大林、加里宁签署。在这会议上，斯大林在自己的报告中指出，改组国家监察机构的主要目的，就是使它民主化以及与工农群众接近。使国家监察部成为人民的、广大工农群众所能接近的机构，通过监察，把他们吸收到新生活建设工作里来——这就是国家监察机构要解决的任务。一九一九年四月九日这一列宁和斯大林的命令奠定了组织真正人民的，社会主义的国家监察部的基础。
    组织社会主义的监察，是和斯大林的名字分不开的。斯大林展开了紧张的活动，以根本改造国家监察机构，并使他工人化。新鲜的、布尔什维克党性和原则性的气息渗入了监察工作。旧时的沙皇监察的作风——麻木的形式主义，对上级的奴颜和恐惧，对强者的吹拍和谄媚——从根铲除了。国家监察部成了党和苏维埃政府使管理机构布尔什维克化的斗争中的工具。国家监察部的人事组织经过了彻底的整肃。工人和农民，其中有不少共产党员，进入了新生的国家监察部。
    当时国家监察部做了如何巨大的工作以及斯大林同志带来的新作风的深度，是不容易说明的。我们且引述一个意义深刻的文件吧，这文件是一九一九年五月七日（距通过改组国家监察部的法令不到一个月）给希格雷城的特别监察员的：
    “希格雷城国家监察部特别监察员：
    在研究农民骚动的发生原因时，除研究本县农民群众的一致政治情绪外，请注意：
    （１）土地局和国营农场管理处在组织苏维埃农业时的政策：是否有不正当的征用农民土地来组织苏维埃农业的行为；是否有其他严重影响农民经济状况的强迫行为。
    （２）组织集体农业时土地局的政策：在组织农业共营团、农业组合、共耕组等工作中，是否有强迫的因素；组织集体农业时，是否有破坏当地农民利益的事情发生。
    （３）制糖总管理处在将甜菜种植场的土地收归国有时的政策：实施国有化时，是否有破坏农民基本利益的情形；收归国有的田地是否造成农民使用土地的困难；有无其他足以引起农民不满行为（例如，制糖厂占据了远超过它实际需要的土地面积；把以前没有种过甜菜的土地收归国有等）。
    （４）以及下列诸问题：农民骚动是否为本区土地太少的结果；不劳动分子的土地是否划归农民使用，条件如何；本县土地局或其个别代表的活动中，或各村土地局的活动中，是否有不遵照中央命令而引起农民不满的行为，当局是否有无能或滥用的倾向。
    收到电报，请将采取方策电复国家监察部。
    　　　　　国家监察部人民委员长　斯大林
    　　　　　　　　　　　一九一九年五月七日”
    这样的文件使国家监察部的工作人员获得了政治上的指南，学会了站在党的立场上解决政治问题，在列宁——斯大林的关心人民的精神中受到了教育。在组织集体农业时，是否破坏农民的利益，是否有强迫的因素，制糖总管理处的政策如何，收归国有的土地是否造成农民使用土地的困难等等——这些尖锐的政治问题都非常清楚明白地向国家监察员提了出来。
    在这小小的文件中可以看到为党内的列宁路线而斗争的完整的政治纲领。斯大林同志在整个社会主义建设时期不断地提出正确执行党对农民的政策问题。当你读着斯大林同志的这个电报时，你自然而然会想起布尔什维克党为改造个体的农民经济使它走上社会主义道路而艰苦斗争的阶段，会想起斯大林的农业集体化的理论。
    一年后——一九二○年二月——国家监察部改组为工农监察部。在更广泛地吸收工农参加监察和检查工作的基础上，在中央和地方建立了社会主义监察的统一机构。改组后的监察部的任务，是加强与官僚主义斗争、与呆滞、报销、麻木的倾向斗争，检查和研究苏维埃政权各机构在行政管理方面和经济方面的工作。
    监察工作具有了真正全民的性质，工人和农民通过了监察部学会了管理国家的工作。在关于工农监察部的任务的信中，列宁写到：“工农监察部的任务——不但是，或与其是‘破获’，‘追捕’，毋宁说是善于纠正。”
    必需使工农监察部的工作人员认识新的立场，认识自己的任务。在这方面，一九二○年十月十五日在斯大林同志支持下召开了全俄工农监察部负责工作者会议。
    斯大林同志在这会议上的演说，深刻分析了国家机构的状况和国家面临的任务，说明了社会主义的监察工作方法。斯大林向工农监察部的工作人员提出两项基本任务：
    第一个任务，是监察工作者要协助中央和地方的执政同志们确立最适当的统计国家财产的方式，确立适当的会计方式，协助整顿供应机构、平时和战时的机构、经济机构。
    “第二个基本任务是工农监察部在其工作过程中要从工农中间培养出足以掌握整个国家机构的指导者。”
    监察部的改组方针是：以新的力量来积蓄社会主义建设经验，协助国民经济各部门的工农干部。这就要求进一步改变监察和检查工作的方法与形式，要求坚决加强我们各机关的监察机能。
    斯大林深知监察人员工作中的困难，深知个别旧官吏对工农监察部的忠诚工作人员的仇视，深知官僚主义者为隐瞒他们所领导的各机关工作中的错误而造成的种种困难。对于监察人员的这些困难和危险，斯大林说道：“但是工农监察部不必害怕这些。它应该牢记着一条基本规则：不要怜惜个人，不论他们占据怎样的地位，只怜惜事情，怜惜工作的利益。”
    斯大林主持的这次全俄会议是工农监察部工作人员的一个大规模的政治教育的学校。斯大林同志的演说，至今还被监察工作者仔细研究和学习着。国家监察人员应该是怎样的，他应该具备哪些品质——这个迫切的问题，在这篇政纲性的演说中，我们可以找的答案：一个国家监察员应该有巨大的耐心，无瑕的纯洁、忠诚、公正，布尔什维克的原则性。斯大林同志一再指出，工农监察部的工作人员“应该是纯洁的、无可非难的、公正无私的。所以需要这样，是因为他们不但有形式上的、而且有精神上的监察别人，教导别人的权利。”
    斯大林同志任职工农监察人民委员部三年，直到一九二二年四月依照列宁的提议，被选为党中央委员会总书记为止。在这期间，社会主义的监察是党的忠实助手，在检查国民经济各部门方面，在对资料的不经济及浪费，尤其是粮食的浪费斗争方面，在改善政权机构方面，做了巨大的工作。工农监察人民委员部变成了积蓄社会主义建设经验的中心，同时应该指出，工农监察人民委员部的另一重要功绩是它成了一个实践的学校，在那里面工人和农民一方面参加监察和检查的工作，一方面学习了怎样工作得更好和怎样治理国家。
    　　　　二
    内战结束后，布尔什维克党立刻从事复兴被破坏的国民经济，战时共产主义的转变为新经济政策，迅速地、大大地提高了农业。但同时，新经济政策的曲解和投机的倾向摇撼了部分国家机构。列宁集中力量来改善国家管理机构，建立真正社会主义的机构，减缩支出，与各种浪费和滥用斗争，严厉节约，以发展大规模的机器工业和国家电气化。当时特别尖锐地提出了巩固无产阶级领导下的工农联盟问题。
    社会主义建设的新阶段要求改组国内监察机构，改变它的工作方法，增加新生力量。这一监察机构的工作必须十分灵活，要渗入每一角落，过问一切中央和地方的国家机关。列宁把我们的工作的一般计划，党的政策及其战略战术计划，与改组合并中央监察委员会及工农监察部的任务联系起来了。在第十二届党大会开幕前夕，当他缠绵病床时，他还写了两篇文章：“我们应该如何改组工农监察部”及“宁可少些，但要好些”。
    列宁要求把最好的人材集中在工农监察部里，不求人多，但要质精，要挑选特别熟练的、受过特别考验的人，使他们能获得普遍的信任。
    在第十二届党中央委员会的报告中，斯大林同志完全赞同列宁关于中央监察委员会和工农监察部合并的建议。在说明党和国家机构的问题时，斯大林特别指出，这部分报告是与前述列宁的两篇著名文章直接有关的，党要使国家机构成为服务人民的有效工具，而非虚设。“政策是正确的，”报告中指出道，“司机是卓越的，机器的型式是很好的，是苏维埃式的，而这部国家机器的构成部分，即国家机构中的个别工作人员却不好，不是我们自己人。”因此，正确的政治路线给歪曲了。改组后的中央监察委员会和工农监察部必须确保党内的团结，并成为改造国家机构的一切组成部分的重要工具。斯大林指出，这一改组，是为了“使我们国家里不再存留一个被老百姓指为不讲理的官吏，即使是最高级的官吏。”
    大会要求把工农监察部变成一个模范的、与党密切联系的机构。在工农监察部的任务中，提出了要根据预定计划来调查经济和管理机构的领导工作，设法防止个别经济部门的贪污。大会特别注意改善那些与人民直接有关的经济机构和管理机构。大会要求对“自大和轻视工农要求的苏维埃官吏”严厉处罚。
    于是，党进入了为社会主义工业化而斗争的紧张阶段。在一九二六年四月列宁格勒党大会上，斯大林同志严厉指责了那些随便违法和慷国家之慨的领导者。他特别郑重的提出严守经济原则的任务，并要求“不白化一文人民的财产”，使每一文钱都用在国家工业化的需要上。在这篇演说之后，斯大林和库壁希夫又以中央委员会和中央监察委员会的名义要求各级党组织和经济工作人员与浪费及不经济作斗争，要求把这类事实，看作对工人阶级犯罪的行为。
    中央监察委员会和工农监察部的联合机构，获得了极大的威信，在国内生活中起着巨大的作用，成了党的强大武器。先后领导中央监察委员会和工农监察部的有这些杰出的领袖：库壁希夫、奥尔宗尼基泽、安德烈夫等。中央监察委员会和工农监察部的联合机构，协助了党与官僚主义，与呆滞、夸张，以及一切浪费和工作重叠斗争，清除了苏维埃机构中的一切不适宜的人员，奥尔宗尼基泽在第十五届党大会上并非毫无根据地回答诽谤者道：“苏维埃机构在我们的手中，它为我们的社会主义祖国而服务，它——是我们的机构了。”
    　　　　三
    斯大林五年计划在国家工业化的事业中起着特别重大的作用。一九一三年的工业水准早已超过，并且远远超过了。出现了新的重工业部门，在荒芜之地建立了新的工业中心。到第十七届党大会时期——一九三四年，国内的政治经济情势根本改变了。在国民经济中，社会主义成份占着统治地位。党内分裂的危机早已过去。反列宁的敌对集团——外国间谍的代理人，被粉碎了。象中央监察委员会和工农监察部这样的联合机构，不需要了。由一个中心来监察整个国家管理机构和经济机构的阶段，已不适合更新的任务了。现在，在职人员对他们的工作部门个别负责的问题，以及检查党和政府的决议的执行情形，被提到第一位了。斯大林在十七届党大会上指出，“现在我们需要的已不是监察，而是检查中央决议的执行情形——现在我们需要监督中央决议的执行。”
    按照大会决议而建立的苏维埃监察委员会，把自己的主要目标集中于检查政府决议的执行上，这一任务顺利地完成了。然而我国经济的迅速增长显示出，这种监察形式是不够的。对于国家资金和材料的计算与支用的监察，特别显得落后。
    一九四○年根据斯大林同志的建议，在苏维埃监察委员会的基础上建立了苏联国家监察人民委员部。其任务是监察国家资金和物资的支用与计算，以及检查政府决议的执行情形。国家监察部的主要工作方法是对各企业、各组织、各部的经济与财政活动的公文上的检查。
    卫国战争期间，国家监察部的工作集中于对军需供应和国防工业的行动上的检查。卷入苏维埃人民的普遍爱国热情中的监察人员，都忘我地劳动着，以保证战胜法西斯敌人。
    战争和战后时期一次又一次地显示出了社会主义计划经济的巨大优点。当那些受到轻微战争损害的资本主义国家呆滞不前时，苏联到战后五年计划的第三年年底却已经超过了战前的工业生产水准。在这几年，社会主义农业也达到了巨大的成就。斯大林同志在一九四六年二月竞选大会上描述了今后更长期间我们的巨大工作计划。斯大林说，在最近三个五年计划期间，我们要做到使苏联的工业能每年生产五千万吨铁、六千万吨钢、五亿吨煤、六千万吨石油。这真正是一个空前伟大的计划，它将保证共产主义社会的建立，使苏联可以避免一切意外。国家监察部将用特殊的、它所特有的方法来争取这一次伟大计划的实现。
    社会主义的国家监督部在它成立的三十年间，经历过不同的组织上的变化，但它始终是党和政府检查它们的决议执行的有力武器。
    在为共产主义社会斗争的条件中，国家的作用及其经济组织的机能不断增长着。巩固和改善国家机构，提高各环节中的政治纪律，提高每一个工作人员对自己的工作的责任心——这就是苏维埃监察工作人员的任务。
    斯大林同志所提出的必需节省人民的每一文钱以进一步发展经济，厉行节约，取消一切浪费和滥用国家钱财的问题，以新的力量提出来了。
    足以迅速发展我国经济的后备力量，很多还没有发现。个别企业的领导者还常常隐瞒生产力，在拟定计划时要花巧，并不特别努力去完成和超过计划，揭发这类奸计——是国家监察人员的光荣工作。遗憾的是我们在这方面还很落后。
    在生产中节省材料、不扔弃物资——这也能够迅速提高我国的经济。但是我们检查企业的结果，发现这方面做得还不够。监察人员必须学会不但用大数目——吨，而且用小数目——格兰姆，来计算物资。
    为真正减低生产成本，为精确的核算制度而斗争——这是不能离开监察人员的议事日程的。生产成本的人为的增高，使得某些企业的领导者很容易完成减低成本的计划，而不必去动员群众改善工作的质素。
    为保护人民的财产，各企业中的会计制度必需健全起来，会计机构不应该专门为经济领导人员编造数字。监察人员必须特别注意这部门工作。
    党和政府要求提高各种产品的质素。我们的工业能够生产世界上最好的货物，最好的机器。问题就在对工作的忠诚态度，就在对货物的品质负责。国家监察部应该更多从事这方面的工作。
    斯大林同志说过：“对执行工作的卓越的审查——这就是一盏探照灯，它帮助我们了解任何时期的机关工作的情况，并且把官僚主义者和事务主义者都暴露无遗。”党中央和政府今天正努力加速发展国民经济，努力在生产中增加最新的技术，努力提高人民的幸福。经常的、深入地检查政府决议的执行情形——这是国家监察部的直接义务。
    国家监察机构，现在能够对经济和生产技术的复杂问题进行大规模的，深入的检查。在监察人员中有国民经济各部门的专家，有许多受过高等教育、经验丰富的人材。
    国家监察部及其工作人员必须跟一切解决政治问题时的官僚主义倾向斗争。国家监察部首先要以合法性、适当性的观点，从整个国家的立场来评价各种事实与现象。对于监察人员，国家的利益高于一切。监察工作者不论在什么工作部门，他绝不能站在地方性的立场上，他必须不受任何部会或个人的影响。在检查和审查的时候与党机构密切联系，可以免除监察人员的这类错误。
    整个国家监察机构和每一个监察人员，必须随时随地推行党的路线，绝对公正，在总结检查工作时百分之百地客观和诚实，不得有偏向，虚伪和不诚实。监察人员应该去除任何偏见，时时记住斯大林同志的指示：“在某种偏见下去追查数字，这是犯了刑事罪。”
    我们必须大大提高监察人员的一般文化水准和政治水准，在列宁斯大林的精神中教育他们。监察工作的繁复，要求我们郑重地培养监察工作者，使他们避免工作中的错误。我们必须做到，象列宁斯大林所要求的，使监察人员都由有教养的，可以信托的人们组成，“他们一个字都不失信，一个字都不违背良心。”国家把审察苏维埃机构，审察苏维埃工作人员的重任交托给国家监察部。这大大加重了监察人员的责任。我们的任务就是要不辜负人民的信托、党中央和政府的信托、斯大林同志的信托。
    注（一）　国家监察，原是对国家资金支出的正当与否的一种检查。在资产阶级国家中，国家监察机构仅限于检查支出的形式上的正确性和它们的公文报销。苏联十月革命初期，国家监察机构也多半带有着这种性质，直到一九二○年，国家监察部改组为工农监察部后，才有了彻底的改变。现在，在苏联，形式上的监察机能，即对于支出的合法性和正确性的检查，由财政人民委员部负责，而对于经济的适当和支出的合理，乃至对整个国家机构工作的监察，都交由工农监察人民委员部负责。
