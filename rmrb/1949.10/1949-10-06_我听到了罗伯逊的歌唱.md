　　I Heard Robeson Sing
    Jing Ye

    "Arise, ye who refuse to be slaves!..." Clear and powerful, it struck my heart. A dozen or so friends and I huddled around a radio, quietly listening to our great international friend—the American Black singer—Paul Robeson sing the Chinese people's favorite "March of the Volunteers" in Chinese.

    His voice was so loud, magnificent, and kind. My entire being was concentrated in his singing. I felt unspeakable joy and happiness. Every sentence he sang transformed into warmth and strength in my heart. I was encouraged by brotherly love. From the bottom of my heart, I felt a sublime respect and love for him—a heroic warrior who persisted in fighting for world peace and democracy. I seemed to see his face filled with the brilliant light of international friendship, a light that illuminated every oppressed and enslaved soul and bound them closely together.

    In the midst of joy and excitement, I remembered the scene of the concert hosted by Robeson being attacked and beaten by thugs and veterans in Peekskill. My joy turned to hatred. I hated the despicable and shameless tactics of American imperialism in dealing with the progressive forces of the people. At the same time, it made me more clearly recognize a truth: all the reactionaries in the world are sworn enemies of the people. The people of the world must stand up and unite closely, unite around the peace fortress headed by the Soviet Union, to jointly overthrow our enemies and jointly struggle to build a beautiful world without exploitation or oppression.

　　我听到了罗伯逊的歌唱
    竞业
    “起来，不愿做奴隶的人们，……”清晰而有力地打入我的心坎，我和十几个朋友紧紧地围在一架收音机旁，静静地倾听着我们伟大的国际友人——美国黑人歌唱家——保罗·罗伯逊用中国话歌唱中国人民最喜爱的“义勇军进行曲”。
    他的歌声是那么响亮、雄伟而亲切，我全副心灵都贯注在他的歌声中，我感到说不出的快乐和高兴。他唱出的每一句歌声在我的心中都化为温暖和力量，我被兄弟般的友爱鼓舞着。我从心底对他——一个为世界和平与民主坚持斗争的英勇战士——发生一种崇高的敬意和热爱。我仿佛看到他的脸上充满了灿烂的国际友爱的光辉，这光辉照亮每个受压迫受奴役的心灵，并把它们紧紧地联系在一起。
    在喜悦和激动之余，我想起罗伯逊主持的音乐会在毕克斯基尔被暴徒和退伍军人袭击和殴打的情景，我的欢欣顿时变为痛恨，我痛恨美帝对待人民进步力量的卑鄙无耻的下流手段，同时让我更清楚地认识到一个真理：世界上所有的反动派都是誓死与人民为敌的，世界上的人民要站起来，就必须紧紧地团结在一起，团结在以苏联为首的和平堡垒的周围，来共同打倒我们的敌人，并且为建设一个没有剥削、没有压迫的美好的世界而共同斗争。
