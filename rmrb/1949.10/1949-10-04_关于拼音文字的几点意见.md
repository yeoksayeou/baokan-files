Some Opinions on Pinyin Writing
    Boxan
    In China, the Pinyin writing movement made considerable progress during the six or seven years from 1934 to 1941. Due to the mass character of this movement at that time, the Latinization scheme was already familiar to many educated youths and even workers and peasants. Today, if we want to carry out writing reform, we can only seek improvement on the basis of this old scheme, which has a historical position, and there is no need to start from scratch.
    Now, opinions on revising the plan are gradually converging. For example, many people agree that zhi chi shi rh z c s should be added with a vowel letter when they form a syllable by themselves. Because doing so can distinguish between stressed and unstressed syllables. For example, the "zi" in "wenzi" (文字, writing) is stressed, and the "zi" in "wenzi" (蚊子, mosquito) is unstressed. The unstressed syllable does not add a vowel letter, so it is clearly distinguished from the stressed syllable. Furthermore, with a vowel as a syllable symbol, it is also distinguished from s sh (such as bus) that do not form syllables in foreign languages. For example, schemes for several dialects often use different letters for the same pronunciation, or the same letter represents different pronunciations. Therefore, everyone feels that it is necessary to synthesize or converge to create a unified scheme. For example, the letter h is a symbol for retroflex sounds in the Northern dialect scheme, and a symbol for voiced sounds in the Jiangnan dialect scheme. If a dialect has both retroflex and voiced sounds, it becomes a problem. For example, in the Hunan dialect, the words "ci" (慈) and "chi" (迟) are the voiced sounds of z and zh. If "ci" is represented by zh, it will be confused with "zhi" (知), "zhi" (之), etc., and it is also unsightly to write "chi" as zhh. There is also the issue of homophones. Although this problem is not very serious in the new script with words as the unit, there are many commonly used monosyllabic words in spoken language, so the problem of confusion between homophones with different meanings still exists. Some methods to solve this problem include using fixed-form characters or advocating the use of tone symbols. Using fixed-form characters inevitably blocks the path of natural language improvement. Adding tone symbols is not very aesthetically pleasing and increases the trouble when typing. Mr. Lu Zhiwei once advocated making four different keys for each vowel, which is equivalent to adding twenty or so letters, which seems to greatly reduce the dexterity of the typewriter.
    Although the problem has been generally recognized, there is no unanimous opinion on the solution. For example, many people advocate using y for the vowel after z c s..., but it is really not as good as using a single letter y to represent the "yu" (雨, rain) and "yu" (鱼, fish) rhymes. I think another method should be found for the vowel letters of zcs and other characters. In the past, some people suggested adding a symbol to i, which can be used; because this rhyme originally evolved from the i rhyme, and it is still the i rhyme in Cantonese. On the typewriter, j can be used temporarily instead.
    It seems unnecessary to change x to h. For example, the "he" in "Don Quixote" (堂吉诃德) and the "ha" in "Rojas" (罗哈斯) are both spelled with x, and Russian also uses x to represent this sound. The letter h is already a retroflex symbol and a voiced sound symbol, so it seems unnecessary to take on another function.
    It is not easy to achieve complete unification in a unified scheme, because if all the phonemes of various dialects are to be represented by different letters, these twenty-odd letters are not enough. In addition to兼职（occupying multiple posts/functions), symbols must be added. Therefore, the fact that h is both a retroflex sound symbol and a voiced sound symbol is a last resort. As for the voiced sounds of z, zh, etc., some people advocate adding a small dot on top of the unvoiced letter to represent it. I think this can be adopted. Similarly, there should be no problem with g k x also serving as symbols for palatalized sounds. Mr. Lu Zhiwei said that Cantonese has both unpalatalized gi, ki and palatalized gi, ki, and there is no way to distinguish between the two (original text see People's Daily, September 6), but in "Guangla" (广拉，Guangdong Latinization), an e is always inserted before unpalatalized gi, ki, that is gei, kei. Therefore, palatalized gi, ki are still written the same as in Northern dialect, and there is no confusion.
    The nq in the Cantonese scheme should be changed to ng and gwu should be written as gu as in the Northern dialect. As for the gu in the current Guangla, its rhyme is wider, and it seems that a symbol can be added above u, or it can be rewritten as goo. The w in Cantonese and the ui in Northern dialect have different pronunciations. The latter can be changed to uei, but the Chinese characters they represent are roughly the same (such as Mei (梅), Mei (妹), Hui (会)), so it doesn't matter to use the same symbol. The ou in Cantonese and the ou in Northern dialect have different pronunciations, and the Chinese characters they represent are also different. Some people advocate changing the ou in Northern dialect to eu to show the difference, which is a suggestion worth accepting.
    The problem of homophones cannot be solved solely by focusing on the shape of the characters, because phonetic confusion should in principle be resolved by phonetic distinctions. Therefore, we must pay attention to using other synonyms to replace them. For example, "baowei" (保卫, defend) and "baowei" (包围, surround) are homophones, so "baohu" (保护, protect) can be used instead of "baowei" (保卫, defend). It is not convenient to do this with words that the masses are familiar with, but words created by intellectuals can be reviewed one by one and stipulated in this way. So how to deal with words that the masses are familiar with? I think fixed-form characters and tone symbols can be unified, that is to say, some homophones are distinguished by tone, and we can use letters representing tones to fix the form. A friend of mine suggested adding h before the vowel to represent the yangping tone in Northern dialect, because the yangping characters are precisely transformed from voiced sounds, and the yangping sound in Jiangnan dialect is a voiced sound. It is quite reasonable to use the voiced sound symbol as the yangping symbol. The departing tone can also use h, but it is placed after the vowel. The rising tone is more circuitous, and the form of lengthening the vowel can be used, such as ui as uei, a as aa, un as uen, and so on. Some characters that are homophones and have the same tone, such as li (力, strength), li (利, benefit), li (隶, subordinate), are all departing tones, and this method can also be used to solve this problem, that is, one or two characters are used in the tone form, and the rest are not. For example, li (力) is written as lih, and li (利), li (隶) are still written as li, so that "nuli" (努力, effort) and "nuli" (奴隶, slave), "shuili" (水力, water power) and "shuili" (水利, water conservancy) can be clearly distinguished. Using this method is similar to adding tone symbols outside the character, because the h added before and after the vowel can be removed at any time and does not affect the original spelling; only the rising tone is a little awkward, and it is more difficult to restore the original state. However, since we treat them as special forms, we will certainly not adopt them universally, only when they are absolutely necessary, and it probably will not add much trouble. We can look at the new script works of Mr. Xie Jingyong and others published by Guanghua Bookstore. The number of characters using special forms is only over a hundred—this is the result of a comprehensive study—indicating that the number of characters that should adopt special forms is limited. Therefore, there seems to be no problem with the above method (in the above example of the yangping form, "Tang" (唐) "Tang" (糖) is written as thang, to distinguish it from "Tang" (汤) tang; "Mao" (毛) is written as mhao, to distinguish it from "Mao" (猫) mao).
    Although the book by Mr. Xie Jingyong and others is based on Mr. Lin Dieken's "Guoyu Pinyin Vocabulary" (国语拼音词汇), the number of fixed-form characters is far less than in the original book. Probably the original book treated the jian and tuan sounds separately as special forms (sometimes the jian and tuan sounds it stipulates do not match the actual jian and tuan sounds). Now the distinction between jian and tuan sounds is universally adopted, so the number of fixed-form characters has been reduced by more than a hundred. In areas where there is no distinction between jian and tuan sounds, people find this distinction too difficult, so they advocate not using the distinction. However, if there is no distinction, there will be more confusion in the shape of homophones. Because zi, ci, si, zy, cy, sy... these sounds, there are dozens of them, all merged into gi, ki, xi, gy, ky, xy... those sounds. In the past, the new script of Northern dialect distinguished between jian and tuan sounds. According to a friend who does not understand the distinction between jian and tuan sounds, there was no difficulty in reading, but they just regarded jian sound characters as tuan sound characters. It is a little more difficult when writing. But after reading many books, you will also know the distinction. I advocate retaining the distinction between jian and tuan sounds, but yo can be changed to ye or iao according to the Beijing pronunciation, and yng can be changed to jung.

　　关于拼音文字的几点意见
    Ｂｏｘａｎ
    我国拼音文字运动，在一九三四到一九四一这六七年间，颇有相当的进展。由于当时这一运动的群众性，拉丁化方案已经为不少的知识青年甚至工农分子所熟知了。今天我们要进行文字改革，只有在这一有了历史地位的旧方案的基础之上来求改进，用不着另起炉灶了。
    现在修改方案的意见逐渐集中起来了。如ｚｈ　ｃｈ　ｓｈ　ｒｈ
　ｚ　ｃ　ｓ自成音段时得加一母音字母，已有许多人赞同。因为这样做，一则可以分别轻重音，例如“文字”的“字”是重音，“蚊子”的“子”是轻音，轻音不加母音字母，就和重音字分别得很清楚；再则有了母音为音节符号，和外来语中不成音节的ｓ
　ｓｈ（例如ｂｕｓ）等也有个分别。又如几种方言的方案，往往同一语音用不同的字母，或者同样的字母表示不同的语音，因此大家感到有综合起来或汇通起来，制成统一方案的必要。例如ｈ这个字母，在北方话方案，是卷舌音的符号；在江南话方案，是浊音符号。如果遇到一种方言，既有卷舌音，又有浊音，那就成了问题。比方湖南方言中“慈”字及“迟”字是ｚ及ｚｈ的浊音，如果以ｚｈ表“慈”，就和“知”“之”等混淆，而“迟”写成ｚｈｈ也很不好看。还有同音字问题，虽然以词为单位的新文字，这个问题不很严重；但是口语中常用的单音词不少，因此同音异义的混淆问题还是存在的。解决这一问题的方法，有的用定型字，有的主张用声调符号。用定型字，不免阻塞了语言自然改进的路。加声调符号则不大美观，而且在打字时增加麻烦。陆志韦先生曾经主张给每个母音制成四个不同的键，那就等于增加二十个上下的字母，似乎大大减少了打字机的灵巧。
    问题虽然已是大家公认的了，但解决的方法却还没有一致的意见。比方ｚｃｓ……后面的母音，很多人主张用ｙ，但是“雨”“鱼”韵改用复合韵母来表示，实在不如用单一字母ｙ的好。我以为ｚｃｓ等字的母音字母应该另想办法，过去有人提议在ｉ上加符号，这是可以用的；因为这个韵本来由ｉ韵转变而来，现在广东音还是ｉ韵。在打字机上，暂时可以用ｊ代替。
    ｘ改为ｈ，似乎没有必要，比方“堂吉诃德”的“诃”，“罗哈斯”的“哈”，都是用ｘ拼的，俄文也是用ｘ表示这音的。ｈ已经是卷舌符号浊音符号了，似乎不必再兼别职。
    统一方案不容易做到完全统一，因为各种方言的音素如果全部要用不同的字母表示，这二十多个字母是不够的。除了兼职以外，就得加符号。因此ｈ既是卷舌音符号也是浊音符号，就是不得已的办法。至于ｚ，ｚｈ等音的浊音，有人主张在清音字母的顶上加一小点来表示，我以为这是可以采用的。同样ｇｋｘ兼充腭化音的符号，也应该没有问题。陆志韦先生说广州话既有不腭化的ｇｉ，ｋｉ也有腭化的ｇｉ，ｋｉ两者无从分别（原文见九月六日人民日报），但“广拉”里面，凡不腭化的ｇｉ，ｋｉ总是插进了一个ｅ的，就是ｇｅｉ，ｋｅｉ，因此腭化的ｇｉ，ｋｉ还是照北方话一样写，不至于混淆。
    广州话方案的ｎｑ应该照北方话一样改用ｎｇ，ｇｗｕ应照北方话写成ｇｕ，至于现在广拉中的ｇｕ，它的韵比较宽弘，似乎可在ｕ上面加符号，或者改写为ｇｏｏ，广州话的ｗ和北方话的ｕｉ不同音，北方话的可以改成ｕｅｉ，不过它们所代表的汉字大致相同，（如梅妹会）用同一符号也无妨。广州话的ｏｕ和北方话的ｏｕ不同音，所代表的汉字也不同，有人主张把北方话的ｏｕ改成ｅｕ以示区别，这是值得接受的一种意见。
    解决同音字问题，不能专在字形上想办法，因为语音上的混淆，原则上应该用语音上的分别去解决。因此我们就得注意采用别的同义词来代替，比方“保卫”与“包围”同音，就可以用“保护”代替“保卫”。已经为群众用熟了的词儿，不便照这样做，但知识分子所制造的词，是可以逐一审查，照这样规定起来的。那么群众用熟了词儿又怎样处理呢？我以为定型字和声调符号可以统一起来，这就是说，某些同音词是依靠声调来分别的，我们可以采用代表声调的字母来定型。有一位朋友主张将ｈ加在母音前面表示北方话的阳平，因为阳平字正是由浊音转变的，江南话的阳平音，就是浊音，用浊音符号为阳平符号，是颇为合理的。去声也可以利用ｈ，不过是放在母音的后面。上声比较曲折，可以用母音拉长的形式，如ｕｉ作ｕｅｉ，ａ作ａａ，ｕｎ作ｕｅｎ之类。有些同音又同调的字，如力、利、隶、都是去声，也可以用这个方法解决，这就是把一两个字用声调形式，其余不用，如力作ｌｉｈ，利、隶仍作ｌｉ，这就可以把“努力”和“奴隶”，“水力”和“水利”分别清楚了。用这个方法，和在字外面加声调符号，是差不多的，因为加在母音前后的ｈ，随时可以去掉，并不影响原来的拼法；只是上声稍为别扭一些，想要回复原状，是比较难些的。不过我们既把它们当作特别形式，当然不会普遍采用，只有十分必需的时候才采用，大概也不会增加好多麻烦。我们看看光华书店出版的谢景永先生等人的新文字著作，采用特别形式的字，不过百多个—这是经过全盘研究而得的结果——可见应采特殊形式的字是有限的。因此照上面的方法，似乎没有毛病（上面阳平形式的例子，“唐”“糖”作ｔｈａｎｇ，与“汤”ｔａｎｇ分别；“毛”作ｍｈａｏ，与“猫”ｍａｏ分别）。
    谢景永先生等人的书虽然是根据林迭肯先生“国语拼音词汇”编的，但定型字就远不如原书的多。大概原书是把尖团音分别当作特别形式的（有时它规定的尖团音，与实际上的尖团音不符），现在是普遍采用尖团音的分别，所以减少了百多个定型字。在尖团音没分别的地区，人们觉得这个分别太难，因此主张不用分别。可是不分别的话，同音字的字形混淆，就多了许多。因为ｚｉ，ｃｉ，ｓｉ，ｚｙ，ｃｙ，ｓｙ……这些音，总有好几十个，都合并到ｇｉ，ｋｉ，ｘｉ，ｇｙ，ｋｙ，ｘｙ……那些音里面去了。过去北方话新文字是分别了尖团音的，据一位不明尖团音分别的朋友说，阅读时并没有困难，只是遇到尖音字当团音字看吧了。写作时稍微困难一点。但读了很多书以后，也会知道分别。我主张仍旧保留尖团音的分别，但ｙｏ可以照北平音改为ｙｅ，或ｉａｏ，ｙｎｇ可以改为ｊｕｎｇ。
