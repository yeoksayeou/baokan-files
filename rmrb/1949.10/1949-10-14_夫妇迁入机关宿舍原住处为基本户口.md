　　Husband and Wife Move into Government Dormitory, Original Residence is Basic Household Registration Editor:
　　Regarding three questions about household registration, please forward them to the relevant departments for answers in the newspaper, hoping for a reply.
　　1. If both husband and wife work in revolutionary government organs and have moved into their respective government dormitories, and their child is entrusted to a nursery, with the original residence only used for storing belongings or occasional rest, should the adults' household registration be reported at the dormitory or the original residence? How should the child's registration be filled out? 2. Where should the household registration of citizens who have entered revolutionary schools (such as China University, Revolutionary University) be reported? 3. The household registration of citizens who have entered revolutionary schools has been cancelled at their original residence. Upon graduation, they have no household registration and therefore no transfer certificate. When transferring to work in a government organ, they also have no household registration, essentially becoming "black people" (meaning without household registration). How should the competent authorities handle this?
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Sincerely, Huang Huayi, Li Weimin, etc.
Huang Huayi, Li Weimin:
　　Regarding the household registration questions you asked, the replies are as follows:
　　1. If both husband and wife work in revolutionary government organs and live in their respective government dormitories, and the child is sent to a nursery, with the original residence only used for storing belongings or occasional rest. In this situation, household registration can be declared at both locations, with the original residence as the basic household registration. On the household registration form, indicate the address of the other residence. The child's registration should be handled as "going elsewhere."
　　2. Household registration for those who have entered revolutionary schools: (1) If there is an existing household registration and an individual enters school, and there are still family members at home, they should declare "going elsewhere" at the original residence, indicating the address of the other location. (2) If an individual enters school and has no family members, the household registration at the original residence should be handled as "moving out," and the school should then declare their household registration.
　　3. If there was a household registration in Beijing before entering school, which was cancelled due to enrollment, and the individual still resides in Beijing after graduation, a certificate issued by the school will suffice when re-registering the household.

　　夫妇迁入机关宿舍原住处为基本户口编辑：
    兹有关于填报户口三个问题，请转询有关部门，于报端答复为盼。
    一、夫妇二人均在革命机关工作，并均迁入各该机关宿舍，小孩一人送交托儿所托管，在原居住处所只充存放什物或偶作休息之用的情况下，大人户口应报宿舍抑或报原住所？小孩又该如何填报？二、已经入革命学校（如华大、革大）之市民的户口应报何处？三、已入革命学校之市民原居住处户口已销，俟毕业后，因无户口故无迁移证，转入机关工作亦无户口，无形成为“黑人”（即无户口意），主管当局对此应如何处理？
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　黄化一、李伟民等敬上黄化一、李伟民先生：
    关于所问户口问题，兹答复如下：
    一、夫妇二人，均在革命机关工作，并在各该机关宿舍住宿，小孩送交托儿所，原住所只充存放什物，或偶作休息。这样情况，两处均得申报户口，以原居住地为基本户口，在户口表上，注明另有住所之地址，小孩则按他往办理。
    二、已入革命学校户口：（一）原有户口，个人入学，家里尚有眷属，应在原居住地申报他往，注明他往地址。（二）个人入学校，无眷属，在原居住地，按迁出户口办理，其户口再由校方申报。
    三、入学校前，在北京已有户口，因入学注销，毕业后，仍在北京住居，再报户口时，经该校出具证明即可。
