Promoting Overseas Chinese Remittances

　　I. The Importance of Overseas Chinese Remittances

　　Overseas Chinese capital is the accumulation of the labor export and material export of the Chinese people. It should be absorbed back into the country in large quantities to assist in the development of the new China's economic construction and promote the centralized use of such remittances.

　　Of the Chinese people residing overseas, Guangdong and Fujian account for the most. According to pre-war statistics from the puppet Central Overseas Affairs Office, there were more than 8,546,000 Overseas Chinese scattered around the world, of which more than 5,992,000 were from Guangdong, accounting for 70 percent. Together with the 2,500,000 Overseas Chinese from Fujian, the two provinces of Guangdong and Fujian account for more than 95 percent of the total.

　　Overseas Chinese remittances are most numerous in Guangdong and Fujian. In 1936, the total amount of Overseas Chinese remittances nationwide was 320 million 法币 (National Currency), of which Guangdong accounted for more than 270 million 法币, and Fujian accounted for about 40 million 法币. In 1937, the total amount of Overseas Chinese remittances was 450 million 法币, of which Guangdong accounted for more than 380 million 法币, and Fujian accounted for about 60 million 法币. In 1938, the total amount of Overseas Chinese remittances was 600 million 法币, of which Guangdong accounted for 500 million 法币, and Fujian accounted for about 80 million 法币. Overseas Chinese remittances from Guangdong and Fujian accounted for more than 90 percent of all Overseas Chinese remittances.

　　Overseas Chinese remittances played a significant role in the economy of old China. For example, in 1936, the annual trade deficit was 430 million 法币, while Overseas Chinese remittances accounted for 320 million 法币. In 1937, the annual trade deficit was more than 640 million 法币, while Overseas Chinese remittances accounted for 450 million 法币. In 1938, the trade deficit was 430 million 法币, while Overseas Chinese remittances reached a massive 600 million 法币, which was more than enough to offset the trade deficit. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Kuomintang government not only relied on Overseas Chinese remittances to cover the trade deficit, but also earned a lot of foreign exchange to fill the financial deficit. At the same time, it maintained the livelihoods of more than 15 million family members of Overseas Chinese, invested in schools, industries, and businesses, and built houses and bridges, making a significant contribution to the local economy.

　　After the War of Resistance Against Japan, Overseas Chinese remittances amounted to 1.2 billion 法币 in 1939, equivalent to US$125,209,200; 1.8 billion 法币 in 1940; 233 million 法币 in 1941; 862 million 法币 in 1942; 2.4 billion 法币 in 1943; 1.482 billion 法币 in 1944; and 1 billion 法币 in 1945. From 1939 to 1945, the US dollar equivalent of Overseas Chinese remittances was not published, so it is unknown how much it was in US dollar terms, but it is undeniable that the value of Overseas Chinese remittances decreased year by year.

　　According to the official statistics of the puppet government, the Overseas Chinese remittance income in 1946 was US$31,489,000 (the US exchange rate was changed from 1:500 to 1:2020 on March 4, then to 1:3350 on September 18, and then raised to 5530 on October 14). The Overseas Chinese remittance income for the whole year of 1947 was US$8,290,000 (the exchange rate was changed to 1:12000 on February 3, and to a floating "market price" on August 17, which fluctuated with market supply and demand, that is, with the black market exchange rate). The Overseas Chinese remittance income for the whole year of 1948 was US$21 million. After March of that year, the "market price" was no longer used because the difference between the black market price and the official market price was too large. In June, the method of exchange settlement certificates and subsequent foreign exchange transfer certificates was announced. On August 19, 金元券 (Gold Yuan notes) were used, and the price of foreign exchange changed several times a day, causing turmoil, which led to a rapid decline in Overseas Chinese remittances. From 1946 to 1948, Overseas Chinese remittance income was only calculated in US dollars, and the figures converted into 法币 and 金元券 were not published, because that was a terrifying astronomical figure.

　　In the era of the puppet government, Overseas Chinese remittance income plummeted from over US$133 million in 1937 to over US$8 million in 1947 and over US$21 million in 1948, proving the collapse of the puppet government's economy and the inevitable demise of the reactionary Kuomintang regime. In 1939, Overseas Chinese remittances could still maintain more than US$120 million, which was due to the patriotic enthusiasm of Overseas Chinese in the early stage of the War of Resistance Against Japan, and also because the 法币 was still relatively stable at that time. Later, due to the fall of Hong Kong (December 25, 1941), Overseas Chinese remittances became inconvenient, and more importantly, due to the continuous devaluation of the 法币, Overseas Chinese remittances to China often suffered losses of 25 to 50 percent. At the same time, when Overseas Chinese families received remittances, prices rose several times a day, resulting in an actual income of less than 20 to 30 percent of the remittances. At the same time, due to the monopoly of foreign exchange by the Four Big Families, the plunder of foreign exchange, the strangulation of exports, and the monopoly of imports, Overseas Chinese remittances could not return to China in the form of goods. Therefore, Overseas Chinese remittances plummeted, and the puppet government's income from Overseas Chinese remittances became increasingly meager. In addition, due to the resistance of Overseas Chinese to the monopoly of the puppet government, Overseas Chinese remittances were mostly remitted through the black market and Hong Kong, thus greatly weakening the income of the puppet government and promoting the disintegration of the entire economy of the puppet government.

　　II. The Decline of Overseas Chinese Remittances

　　From February 1947, due to the puppet government's huge military expenditures, the extreme hyperinflation of the 法币, and the Four Big Families' seizure of wealth, a large amount of foreign exchange was mostly squandered. However, tens of millions to 100 million US dollars of foreign exchange were still needed every year to support its reactionary war and maintain its precarious regime, and this foreign exchange had to rely on Overseas Chinese remittances.

　　However, Overseas Chinese remittances entered the black market to escape this terrible magic web. There are no clear statistics on how much Overseas Chinese remittances entered the black market. The reason is that reactionary governments in various parts of Southeast Asia have explicitly restricted the amount of remittances from Overseas Chinese, and the domestic puppet government has cracked down on foreign exchange dealers, forcing Overseas Chinese remittance business to be carried out in secret. Private banks and money shops in various parts of China have used various methods to avoid inspection and hide accounts, making it extremely difficult to investigate an accurate amount. According to general estimates, Overseas Chinese remittances remitted through the black market were about US$130 million in 1946, about US$80 million in 1947, and about US$60 million in 1948. As far as the puppet government's Overseas Chinese remittance collection is concerned, the total amount of Overseas Chinese remittances received by the Bank of China and the Guangdong Provincial Bank in 1946 was no more than US$30 million, the amount of Overseas Chinese remittances received by the Bank of China in 1947 was no more than US$10 million, the amount received in 1948 was less than US$5 million, and the amount received in 1949 was even less.

　　Compared with the amount of Overseas Chinese remittances before the War of Resistance Against Japan, both public and black market Overseas Chinese remittances have decreased after the outbreak of the civil war. The reasons are nothing more than the following:

　　First, after the outbreak of the civil war, the international status of the puppet government plummeted, and it was unable to protect the interests of Overseas Chinese. Under the orders and instigation of imperialism, various foreign governments directly and indirectly attacked the existence and development of Overseas Chinese industry and commerce, threatened the lives of labor Overseas Chinese, and explicitly restricted Overseas Chinese remittances to China. For example, Malaya only allowed Overseas Chinese to remit 45 Straits dollars per month, the United States only allowed remittances of 100 US dollars, and the Dutch territory only allowed remittances of 105 Dutch guilders.

　　Second, the severe damage suffered by various parts of Southeast Asia in World War II and the rising tide of national independence movements in various places have led to a considerable contraction of industry and commerce in Southeast Asia. At the same time, cheap American and Japanese goods are dumped in various parts of Southeast Asia, which has considerably reduced the income of Overseas Chinese industrialists, businessmen, and workers, and Overseas Chinese remittances have gradually decreased to maintain their capital.

　　Third, the puppet government's extreme hyperinflation, the three major fraud cases of 法币, 金元券 and 银元券 (Silver Yuan notes), caused Overseas Chinese capital to suffer too much loss in China, greatly reducing investment in industry and commerce, and gradually shrinking or relocating domestic industry and commerce to Hong Kong and overseas. Also, due to the rapid and huge depreciation of currency, Overseas Chinese imports of goods have also been greatly reduced. The chaotic situation created by the puppet government in politics, military affairs, and economy made Overseas Chinese dare not remit large amounts of money back to China, and even donations for education, road repairs, and local public welfare undertakings were greatly reduced. Only a very small amount of money was remitted back each year to maintain household expenses.

　　Due to the reduction of Overseas Chinese remittances, the business of Overseas Chinese remittance agencies has also been greatly reduced. There were many banks and money shops operating Overseas Chinese remittances in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shantou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, and other places. Because the puppet government prohibited them from operating foreign exchange, they did not dare to appear in public, and it was impossible to find out how many there were. In Hong Kong, Overseas Chinese remittance agencies (private banks, money shops, etc. operating Overseas Chinese remittances) were restricted by business licenses (formal banks can certainly operate the transfer business of Overseas Chinese remittances in Southeast Asia and the Americas, but due to personnel and business relations, they often entrust commercial firms to transfer remittances), making it difficult to find out the exact number (estimated to be more than 200). Moreover, in order to maintain their business competition, it is difficult to investigate the exact amount of Overseas Chinese remittances remitted by each Overseas Chinese remittance agency, but it is obvious that they have a great influence on Overseas Chinese remittances.

　　Since the unprecedented chaotic economic situation caused by the collapse of 法币 and the massive depreciation of 金元券, the puppet government's economic inspection has also been relaxed, so the transfer of Overseas Chinese remittances is faster than before. In addition, Overseas Chinese remittances are concentrated in Guangdong and Fujian provinces, using Hong Kong dollars as the means of delivery, and Overseas Chinese are afraid that remittances back to China will be plundered by the puppet government, so they concentrate money or goods in Hong Kong. Therefore, the exchange speculation and deferred delivery interest of Overseas Chinese remittance agencies have been greatly reduced, and the business of Overseas Chinese remittance agencies has also declined one after another, or changed to other businesses.

　　The reason why Overseas Chinese remittances have entered the black market and the Overseas Chinese remittance agencies in Hong Kong and domestic banks and money shops is the reactionary economic policy of the puppet government and the Four Big Families' seizure of foreign exchange. But there is a basic fact that must be pointed out, that is, Overseas Chinese remittances have escaped the serious exploitation of the Jiang-controlled area through the black market and concentrated in Hong Kong, and have also suffered from the monetary exploitation of imperialism. After Overseas Chinese remittances arrive in Hong Kong, they suffer losses due to the devaluation of the Hong Kong dollar. This has an essential relationship with the future Overseas Chinese remittance policy and Overseas Chinese remittance methods.

　　III. How to Promote Overseas Chinese Remittances

　　For the sake of the economic construction of the new China, for the sake of the lives of Overseas Chinese families in China, and even more for the sake of Overseas Chinese being spared from the persecution and destruction of imperialism and its colonial reactionary governments, and the losses given by the tangible and intangible devaluation of imperialist currencies, not only should Overseas Chinese themselves continue to remit large amounts of money back to China, but the people's government should also protect and reward Overseas Chinese remittances back to China in the future.

　　At this time when the whole country is about to be liberated, the safety of Overseas Chinese remittances back to China has been guaranteed. Under the policy of the people's government to develop production and prosper the economy, prices are relatively stable, and the credit of the Renminbi is becoming increasingly solid. There is no longer any risk of loss for Overseas Chinese remittances back to China. At present, the imperialist economic panic is becoming increasingly serious, industry and commerce are shrinking, and the oppression of Overseas Chinese by imperialism and its colonies is becoming increasingly severe. It is a good time for Overseas Chinese to remit money back to China and invest in domestic industry and commerce. Under these favorable conditions, the future Overseas Chinese remittance policy urgently needs to be studied and decided.

　　First, the way Overseas Chinese capital returns to China. In the past, Overseas Chinese capital returned to China in two ways: remittances and imports of goods. But in fact, remittances are more than goods; because remittances are simple and fast, and can be used in China in the short term. If goods are purchased and transported back to China, from procurement, ordering, shipping, unloading, and sales, it takes more than a month from the Americas and more than half a month from Southeast Asia. Sometimes, due to poor transportation, it takes more time, and it cannot be sold in the short term after being transported back to China, and often suffers losses due to falling prices. Therefore, the return of goods requires stable social order, stable prices, solid currency values, and developed industry and commerce. But this point is sufficiently guaranteed in the future People's Republic of China, and has a very bright future. Overseas Chinese have a high degree of patriotism, and not only have a lot of money remitted back, but also have technical talents returning to China. Since the return of funds is relatively fast, we should encourage a large amount of Overseas Chinese capital to be remitted back in the future. If remittances are restricted by imperialism, we should organize the transportation of goods back to China in a flexible manner. In the early stage of national liberation, Overseas Chinese investment in domestic industry may not be much, and Overseas Chinese remittances should mainly be remittances and the return of goods (that is, using goods instead of money), but future policies should guide the returned funds to the production field and reward Overseas Chinese for investing a large amount of money directly in industry. Special rewards should be given to Overseas Chinese who gradually move factories set up overseas back to China. Because only in China can there be a future for development.

　　Second, the remittance agency. After the liberation of South China, all Overseas Chinese remittances should be remitted directly to Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and other places, in order to be fast. At the same time, the Overseas Chinese remittance relationship with the Hong Kong puppet Bank of China should be cut off (that is, remittances transferred by the Hong Kong puppet Bank of China should not be accepted), so that it completely loses its role in Overseas Chinese remittances. The conspiracy to disrupt and sabotage our foreign exchange import and foreign exchange policy cannot take effect.

　　Third, unite private Overseas Chinese remittance agencies. Overseas Chinese remittance agencies occupy a very important credit position in the deposit and remittance business of Overseas Chinese. They not only have close business and personal relationships with Overseas Chinese in Hong Kong, Europe, the United States, and Southeast Asia, but also have widespread institutions, simple procedures, fast remittances, and are willing to make overdraft remittances (that is, first remit money back to China for the remitter, and then collect the advance payment from the remitter after the receipt arrives). They are the basic credit institutions among Overseas Chinese and should be united and encouraged to play an active role.

　　Fourth, reward Overseas Chinese capital returning to China. Under the conditions of normal prices and stable currency values, Overseas Chinese capital can be remitted back to the motherland in large quantities, but publicity and rewards are needed to seek universality and breadth. Although we cannot immediately take preferential measures for Overseas Chinese remittances (exchange rates exceeding the official foreign exchange rate), if Overseas Chinese remittances are used to purchase goods, they can be given priority to export excellent goods; if they are used to invest in industry and commerce or state-owned enterprises, they can be allowed to invest in the most profitable and promising industries and enterprises; if they are remittances to maintain the lives of family members, they can be allocated as soon as possible to avoid accumulation; if they are donations or remittances to run education, culture, and related construction undertakings, the people's government should give them honorary and practical rewards to encourage them to absorb foreign capital and remit it back in large quantities to assist in the economic construction of the new democracy.

　　Fifth, flexible Overseas Chinese remittance exchange rates. Before the people's government has officially established diplomatic relations with imperialist countries, and even after diplomatic relations have been established, trade relations with imperialist countries (especially US imperialism) will not be restored in large quantities for a while. US imperialism even wants to sabotage and blockade our international trade. Therefore, the exchange of US dollars and British pounds will not be very large in the short term, so our foreign exchange relationship is mainly Overseas Chinese remittances in the early stage. In order to take care of the interests of Overseas Chinese, we must naturally set reasonable foreign exchange rates. From the parity between the Renminbi and various foreign currencies, from the parity between general domestic prices and international prices, and from the parity between gold and silver internationally, we should set an appropriate exchange rate so that Overseas Chinese capital will not suffer losses or even be profitable when remitted back (for example, to avoid currency devaluation caused by rising prices in Overseas Chinese countries and publicly announced formal devaluation, etc.) to promote a large amount of Overseas Chinese capital to return to China. We should also appropriately adjust the exchange rate according to domestic economic needs and international economic conditions to make it flexible so that it can be suitable for the conditions of economic development and be used flexibly.

　　Sixth, establish overseas institutions of the People's Bank of China. The Central People's Government has been established and has first established diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, Eastern European new democratic countries, and North Korea. Normal diplomatic relations with other countries will soon follow. In order to develop foreign trade and exert the economic power of the new China internationally, we must establish international financial institutions as a hub. First, we must establish branches in the Soviet Union and Eastern European new democratic countries to develop mutually beneficial and equal trade, obtain sufficient funds, and absorb Overseas Chinese remittances in Europe. In the future, after establishing diplomatic relations with Southeast Asia and small countries in the Americas, we should also quickly establish branches to expand trade, safeguard the interests of Overseas Chinese, and facilitate Overseas Chinese remittances. At the same time, we must find ways to destroy the remaining financial forces of the puppet government's reactionaries overseas, notify the countries concerned to extradite their assets, and eradicate their roots so that they have no chance of resurgence under the cover of imperialism.

　　There are many ways to strive for Overseas Chinese remittances. The above are just superficial views, and correct and effective methods can only be gradually generated and gradually reach a reasonable level in the process of implementation. In short, the purpose must be to enable Overseas Chinese capital to return to China in large quantities and fulfill its role in assisting the economic construction of the new China. At the same time, we must gradually get rid of the exploitation of Overseas Chinese remittances by imperialism and its colonial reactionary forces and the financial exploitation of the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries overseas, establish the financial network of the People's Bank of China internationally, develop foreign trade, and safeguard the interests of Overseas Chinese.

　　促进华侨汇款
    王达夫
    一  华侨汇款的重要性
    华侨资金是中国人民劳力输出与中国物资输出的累积，应该大量吸收回国，协助新中国经济建设的发展，并促进此种汇款的集中使用。
    中国侨居在海外的人民，以广东、福建为最多，据伪中央侨务处战前的统计，散居世界各国的华侨共有八百五十四万六千余人，其中广东华侨有五百九十九万二千余人，占百分之七十，连福建华侨二百五十万人，粤闽两省占总数百分之九十五以上。
    华侨汇款以广东、福建两省为最多，民国二十五年，全国侨汇总数为法币三亿二千万元，广东侨汇即占二亿七千余万元，福建约占四千余万元。二十六年侨汇总数为法币四亿五千余万元，广东即占三亿八千余万元，福建约占六千万元。二十七年侨汇总数为法币六亿元，广东即占五亿元，福建约占八千余万元，广东福建华侨汇款，占全部侨汇的百分之九十以上。
    华侨汇款在旧中国经济中，起了重大的作用，例如民国二十五年全年入超为法币四亿三千余万元，侨汇收入即占三亿二千万元。二十六年全年入超为六亿四千余万元，侨汇收入占四亿五千万元。二十七年入超为四亿三千余万元，而侨汇收入，则达六亿元之巨，抵偿入超而有余。国民党政府在抗战之前不但依靠侨汇弥缝了贸易入超，而且赚了许多外汇，填补了财政赤字。同时，维持了华侨的一千五百万以上人口的家属生活，并投资学校工商业，建筑了房屋桥梁，对地方经济贡献颇大。
    在抗战以后，民国二十八年侨汇为法币十二亿元，合美金一亿二千五百二十万零九千二百元，二十九年为法币十八亿元，三十年为法币二亿三千三百万元，三十一年为法币八亿六千二百万元，三十二年为法币二十四亿元，三十三年为法币十四亿八千二百万元，三十四年为法币十亿元。从二十八年到三十四年七年中，侨汇收入折合美元的数字没有公布，不知折合美元究有若干，但侨汇的比值逐年减少，是无可否认的。
    民国三十五年以后的侨汇收入，据伪政府官方的统计，三十五年全年侨汇收入为美金三千一百四十八万九千元（三月四日美汇牌价由一比五○○改为一比二○二○，九月十八日再改为一比三三五○，十月十四日再提高为五五三○）。三十六年侨汇收入全年为美元八百二十九万元（二月三日牌价改为一比一二○○○，八月十七日牌价改为机动“市价”，随市场供求变动，即随黑市汇价波动）。三十七年侨汇收入全年为美金二千一百万元。是年三月以后，因黑市价与官市价差额太大，再不采用机动市价。六月宣布采用结汇证书办法及以后的外汇转移证。八月十九日改用金元券，外汇价格，一日数变，风涌云起，因而侨汇也急速减少。在三十五年至三十七年间，侨汇收入只以美金计算，而不公布折合法币和金元券的数字，因为那是一个可怕的天文数字。
    在伪政府时代，侨汇收入由二十六年的一亿三千三百余万美元，急剧降到三十六年的八百余万美元，三十七年的二千一百余万元；证明了伪政府经济的崩溃，证明反动的国民党政权的必归灭亡。二十八年侨汇尚能保持一亿二千余万元，这是由于抗战初期华侨爱国热忱的表现，也由于当时法币还相当稳定。其后，由于香港沦陷（三十年十二月二十五日），华侨汇款不便，更由于法币之不断贬值，侨汇急剧降落。抗战胜利以后，因伪政府发动了反动的内战，军事支出空前无比的浩大，通货恶性膨胀，官定汇价与黑市汇价相差太大，华侨汇款回国，常遭百分之二十五至百分之五十的损失，同时华侨家属收到汇款时，物价一日数涨，致使汇款实际所得不足百分之二、三十。同时由于四大家族之把持外汇，掠夺外汇，扼杀出口，垄断进口，使侨汇无法以货物的形式回国，因此，侨汇一落千丈，伪政府所得侨汇，日益微薄；另外，也由于华侨对伪政府垄断把持的反抗，侨汇多经由黑市和香港汇回，因而巨大的削弱了伪政府的收入，促成伪政府整个经济的瓦解。
    二　华侨汇款的减退
    从民国三十六年二月起，由于伪政府军事上的无比支出，法币的极端恶性膨胀，和四大家族的劫为己有，把巨额的外汇大部化光。但每年仍需要数千万至一亿的美元外汇，以支持其反动战争，维持其摇摇欲坠的政权，这笔外汇就要依靠侨汇。
    可是侨汇为了逃避这种可怕的魔网，都走进了黑市。这种逃进黑市的侨汇究竟有多少，尚无明确的统计。其原因，是南洋各地反动政府明令限制华侨汇款数额，而国内伪政府又取缔国内经营外汇的行庄，致使侨汇业务，被迫秘密进行，国内各地的私营银行钱庄，俱用各种方法避免检查，隐避帐据，因而想调查一个确实数额，极为困难。据一般估计，经由黑市汇入的侨汇，民国三十五年约为一亿三千万美元，三十六年约为八千万美元，三十七年约为六千万美元。就伪政府经收侨汇而言，三十五年中国银行和广东省银行收入的侨汇，总数不过三千万美元，三十六年中国银行经收的侨汇，不过一千余万美元，三十七年经收的不足五百万美元，三十八年经收的则更微乎其微。
    以抗战前的侨汇数额来比较，内战发生之后，公开侨汇和黑市侨汇都减少了，其原因不外下列数点：
    第一，内战爆发后，伪政府的国际地位，一落千丈，无法保护华侨利益，各外国政府在帝国主义的命令和嗾使之下，直接和间接的打击了华侨工商业的存在和发展，威胁劳工华侨的生活，并明令限制华侨汇款回国。如马来亚每月只准华侨汇出叻币四十五元，美国只许汇出一百美元，荷兰属地只许汇出一百零五元的荷盾。
    第二，南洋各地在第二次大战中所遭受的严重破坏，以及各地民族独立运动的高涨，使南洋各地的工商业相当萎缩。同时美货和日货廉价倾销南洋各地，使华侨工商业者和劳动者的收入，相当减低，华侨为保持其资力，汇款也逐渐减少。
    第三，伪政府极度的恶性通货膨胀，法币、金元券和银元券三大骗案，使华侨资金在国内损失太大，对工商业的投资大为减少，并且将在国内的工商业逐步收缩或迁至香港和海外。又由于币值迅速巨大的贬低，华侨的货物输入，也大量减少。伪政府在政治军事经济上所造成的混乱局面，使华侨不敢大量汇款回国，甚至连兴学修路及地方公益事业的捐款，也大为削减，每年仅汇回极少数款项，维持家用。
    由于侨汇的减少，侨批局的业务，也大为降低。经营侨汇的银号钱庄，在上海、广州、汕头、福州、厦门等地为数甚多，因伪政府禁止其经营外汇，均不敢公开露面，无从查明其究有若干家，在香港的侨批局（经营侨汇的私营银号、钱庄等），因受营业牌照的限制（正式的银号固然可以经营南洋、美洲侨汇的转拨业务，但因人事及业务关系，往往托商号转汇拨兑的亦复不少），亦难查出其确实家数（据估计约在二百家以上）。且各侨批局为保持其营业上之竞争，经汇侨款确数，亦难调查明白，但其在侨汇上所占势力之大，是显而易见的。
    自法币崩溃，金元券跟着大量贬值所造成的空前混乱的经济局面以后，伪政府的经济检查也松懈下来，因而侨汇的转递较前迅速，加之侨汇均集中于粤、闽两省，以港币为解交工具，且华侨因恐汇款归国遭受伪政府之掠夺，多以货币或货物形式集中在香港，故侨批局套汇及延期交付的利息，大为减少，侨批局的业务也就相继萧条，或改营他业。
    侨汇之所以走入黑市，走入香港的侨批局与国内银号钱庄，是伪政府的反动经济政策与四大家族劫持外汇所造成的。但有一基本事实必须指出，就是侨汇经由黑市逃避了蒋管区的严重剥削，而集中到香港，又遭受了帝国主义的货币剥削。华侨的汇款到了香港以后，受了港币贬值的损失，这对于今后的侨汇政策，侨汇方法，有着本质上的关系。
    三　如何促进华侨汇款
    为着新中国的经济建设，为着侨胞在国内的家属生活，更为着华侨免受帝国主义及其殖民地反动政府的迫害、摧残，和帝国主义货币有形无形的贬值所给予的损失，不仅华侨本身要继续不断的大量汇款回国，今后人民政府更应保护和奖励华侨汇款回国的。
    在此全国即将解放的时候，华侨汇款归国的安全，已经有了保障，在人民政府发展生产繁荣经济的政策下，物价相当稳定，人民币信用日益巩固，侨款归国再也没有损失的危险。目前帝国主义经济恐慌日趋严重，工商业日趋萎缩，加以帝国主义及其殖民地对华侨压迫日趋厉害，正是华侨汇款回国投资于国内工商业的良好时机。在这种有利条件下，今后的侨汇政策，急待研究决定。
    第一，侨资归国的方式。过去侨资归国，是采取汇款和输入物资两种方式。但事实上汇款多于物资；因为汇款简便迅速，短期内即可在国内使用。如购运物资回国，从采购、定货、装运、卸货、出售，由美洲需要一月以上，由南洋需要半月以上，有时因运输不畅，需时更多，且运回国内，不能于短期内售出，常遭跌价的损失。因此，运回物资，需要安定的社会秩序、稳定的物价、巩固的币值和发达的工商业。但这点，在今后的中华人民共和国是有足够的保障的，有非常远大光明的前途的。华侨具有高度的爱国热忱，不但有大量资金汇回，而且有技术人才归国。资金回国既较为迅捷，今后应鼓励大量侨资汇回。倘使汇款因受帝国主义的限制，则应机动的组织运输物资回国。在目前全国解放的初期，华侨投资在国内工业方面或者不会很多，侨汇当以汇款和运回物资两种为主（即以货代款），但今后的政策，应引导汇回的资金，投入生产领域，奖励华侨有多量的资金直接投入到工业上去。尤应特别奖励华侨把设在海外的工厂，逐步迁回国内。因为只有在国内才有发展的前途。
    第二，汇款的机构。在华南解放以后，所有侨汇应直接汇至天津、上海、广州等地，以期迅速。同时要切断香港伪中国银行的侨汇关系（即不收由香港伪中国银行的转汇款），使其在侨汇中完全失掉作用。使其对我外汇输入与外汇政策所策动的扰乱破坏阴谋也不能发生效果。
    第三，团结私营侨汇机构。侨批局在华侨的存汇业务上，占有极重要的信用地位，不仅与香港及欧美南洋的华侨在业务上人事上有密切的关系，而且机构普遍，手续简便，汇拨迅速，肯做赊汇（即先替寄款人汇款回国，候收款回批到达后，再向寄款人收回垫款），为华侨中基本的信用机构，应加以团结鼓励，发挥积极作用。
    第四，奖励侨资归国。在物价正常，币值稳定的情形之下，侨资是可以大量汇回祖国的，但需要宣传奖励，以求普遍广大，虽然目前不能马上采取优待侨汇的办法（超过正式外汇牌价的汇价），但华侨汇款回来，如系购货，则可选择优良货物尽先让其输出；如系投资工商业或国营企业，可让其投在最有利最有前途的工商业和企业中去；如其为维持家属生活的汇款，可尽先拨付，不使积压；如其为捐款或兴办教育文化事业及有关建设之汇款，人民政府应予以荣誉上与实际上的奖励，使其努力吸收外国资金，陆续大量汇回，协助新民主主义的经济建设。
    第五，机动的侨汇汇律。在人民政府对帝国主义国家的外交关系未正式建立以前，甚至在外交关系建立以后，对帝国主义（特别是美帝国主义）的贸易关系，一时不会大量恢复，美帝国主义甚至要破坏封锁我们的国际贸易。因此美元、英镑的汇兑，短期内不会顶多，所以，我们的外汇关系，在初期主要的还是侨汇，为了照顾侨胞的利益，自然要订定合理的外汇汇价，从人民币与各外币的比价上，从一般的国内物价与国际物价的比价上，以及从国际间金银的比价上，都宜订出一个适当的汇价，使华侨资金汇回不至吃亏，甚至有利（例如为避免华侨所在国因物价上涨所引起的货币贬值，与公开宣布的正式贬值等），以促进侨资大量归国，并根据国内经济上的需要、国际上的经济情况，适当的调整汇率，使其富有弹性，以便适合于经济发展的条件，而作灵活的运用。
    第六，建立人民银行海外机构。中央人民政府已经成立，已首先与苏联东欧新民主国家及北鲜建立外交关系，与其他各国间正常的外交关系不久也会随之发生。为发展对外贸易，在国际上发挥新中国的经济力量，就要建立国际金融机构，以为枢纽。首先要在苏联及东欧各新民主主义国家设立分支行处，以发展互惠平等的贸易，获得充分的资金，并吸收欧洲的华侨汇款，将来与东南亚及美洲各弱小国家发生外交关系之后，也应迅速设立行处，扩展贸易，维护华侨利益，便利侨汇。同时要设法摧毁伪政府反动派在海外的金融残余势力，通知各该国引渡其资产，铲除其根基，使其没有在帝国主义掩护下死灰复燃之余地。
    争取侨汇的方法甚多，以上所举，只是肤浅之见，而正确有效的方法，只有在执行过程中，才能逐渐产生，逐渐达到合理的地步，总之，其目的必须使华侨资金大量回国，尽到协助新中国的经济建设的作用。同时要使侨汇逐渐摆脱帝国主义及其殖民地反动势力的剥削和国民党反动派在海外残余金融势力的榨取，树立人民银行在国际上的金融网，发展对外贸易，维护华侨利益。
