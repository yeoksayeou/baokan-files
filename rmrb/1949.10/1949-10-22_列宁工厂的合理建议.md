　　Rationalization Proposals at the Lenin Factory

    In the Soviet electrical industry factories, a competition was held to organize workers to carry out inventions and creations. In the competition, the Moscow Lenin Factory ranked first and won a bonus of 20,000 rubles. In addition, eleven of the best inventors and rationalization proposers received individual bonuses.

    This Lenin Factory is a factory where workers' technology has long been the most improved and the most famous, with more than 600 workers. In the past year, they have put forward thousands of production suggestions, which include a wide range of technical issues: the organization of engineering and technical processes, the mechanization of heavy labor, the substitution of valuable materials, and the saving of raw materials, machines, electricity, etc.

    The combination of new production suggestions saved more than two million rubles in the past year. With the help of workers, electrical materials alone saved 590,000 rubles. Many suggestions from rationalization proposers have played a significant role in increasing production.

    The work of inventors and the movement for rationalization are widely encouraged in the factory, and Soviet law strictly protects the rights of production proposers. If the rationalization proposal put forward by a person is very effective in production, then according to the proposal made by the proposer, it is very practical in production, and they will be paid a certain amount of cash compensation and rewards according to the number of savings for the whole year after the improvement.

    Inventors and rationalization proposers are the highest-level people in the factory. The factory provides all the conditions for experts to experiment with their work and serve them, and they can also directly use lathes, instruments, and tools in the workshop. They have the right to order new tools and equipment according to their own drawings.

    Under the factory management office, a special bureau for workers' inventions is set up. Workers, experts, and engineers submit their suggestions to the bureau in writing, so that he obtains the official right to create. When necessary, engineers, technicians, or design experts are absorbed to help workers engage in invention work. They often help workers do complex calculations. Many rationalization proposers have high prestige among all personnel and outside the factory.

    Here is one of them, cutting worker Boronin. After arriving at the factory, he worked on a lathe. After a short time, he learned to work on four types of lathes at the same time, and he could produce very high-quality finished products on each lathe. The secret of his success lies not only in practice, but also in Boronin's making a lot of improvements in performing various work tasks.

    The Soviet people are not satisfied with the existing achievements. Boronin has begun to rationalize his work even more. Usually, Boronin cuts more than 20 different parts per shift and completes two to two and a half times the finished product, but he still has to often manufacture a large number of parts.

    Not long ago, the Lenin Factory held a conference of inventors and rationalization proposers. At the meeting, they discussed their new plans with each other. Every speech was filled with the sole hope of contributing their creations to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, and they also talked about many important opinions on how to organize production.

### 列宁工厂的合理建议

　　列宁工厂的合理建议
    在苏联电气工业工厂里，进行了组织工人开展发明创造的竞赛。在竞赛中，莫斯科列宁工厂占第一位，获得奖金两万卢布。除此以外，还有十一位最好的发明与合理化建议人获得了个人奖金。
    这个列宁工厂，工人的技术很早就是改进最多而最有名的一个厂，这里计有六百多名工人。在过去一年中他们提出了成千以上的生产上的建议，这些建议包括了广泛的技术问题：工程技术过程的组织问题、重劳动机械化的问题、贵重材料代用品的问题，以及原料、机器、电力等节约的问题。
    生产用新建议的结合，过去一年中节约达两百万卢布以上。由于工人的帮助，仅电器材料一项，即节约五十九万卢布。合理化建议者们的许多建议，对提高生产起了很大的作用。
    发明工作人与合理化的运动，在工厂里广泛的受到鼓励，苏联法律严格保护生产建议人的权利。如果这个人提出的合理化建议，对生产上很有效果，那么就按照建议者所提的建议，在生产中很实用，按照改进后全年节约的数字，付给他们一定的现金报酬和奖励。
    发明人与合理化建议人是工厂里最高等的人们。厂方为专家们准备了一切实验自己的工作和为他们服务的条件，他们也可以直接在车间里使用车床、仪器、工具。他们有权按着自己拟定的图样定做新工具和设备。
    在工厂管理处下面，按设工人发明特别局。工人、专家与工程师把自己的建议以书面形式提交局方，这样他便获得创造的正式权利。在必需要的时候，在吸收工程师、技术工人或是设计专家帮助工人从事发明工作。他们常帮助工人做复杂的计算。许多合理化建议人、他们在全体人员中及工厂以外威信都很高。
    这就是他们中的一位，削截工人波罗宁，到了工厂以后，他在一个车床上工作。经过不久以后，他同时学会了四种各型车床的工作，并且他在每一种车床上工作都能做出很高等的成品，他成功的秘诀好办法，并不仅在于实习中，而是在于波罗宁执行各种工作任务中，作出了极多的改善。
    苏联人民没有满足于现有的成绩，波罗宁已开始使自己工作更加合理化，平常波罗宁每班每班削截到二十多个各种零件，并完成二倍到二倍半的成品，但是他还必须常常制造大批的零件。
    在不久以前，列宁工厂开了一个发明工作人与合理化建议人的大会。在会上他们互相谈论了自己新的计划。每一个讲话都充满了唯一的希望，贡献自己的创作，以提前完成五年计划，他们并且谈到了许多如何组织生产的有重要意义的意见。
