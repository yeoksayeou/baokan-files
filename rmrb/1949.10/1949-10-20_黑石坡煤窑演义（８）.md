　　The Black Rock Slope Coal Mine Chronicle (8)
　　Kang Zhuo
　　Eight Discussions

　　YuBao, burdened with worries, left JuBao's house, feeling unbearably stifled, so he went to NiuBao's house.
　　NiuBao wasn't home, so YuBao went straight into NiuBao's sister-in-law's cave dwelling. The woman was spreading a new piece of white foreign cloth on the kang (platform bed), holding an old small cloth shirt, comparing it to the white cloth to cut clothes; when she saw YuBao enter, she threw the old cloth shirt on the kang, glanced at YuBao with her eyes, pouted her lips and said, "Look at this cloth you got! This is also foreign cloth! A finger can poke a hole right through it!" Saying that, she pushed YuBao: "I told you to get six chi (Chinese foot), but you insisted on five chi! Look, I've been measuring all morning, cutting horizontally and vertically, and it's still not enough! Ugh! What a kindness you've done!" YuBao had no time to think about these things, so he sat on the edge of the kang, stammering, "Look, you're pouting and glaring again! Didn't I say? When I'm flush, I'll..." The woman interrupted, "When you're flush! Flush! People aren't three or two years old, so easy to fool, are they? Humph! I don't think you'll ever be flush in your life!" After saying that, the woman pushed YuBao again and said, "Go! Sit to one side! I want to cut clothes here!" YuBao moved to the side, and the woman searched for scissors and rulers, busy while sighing, "Alas! The Dragon Boat Festival is almost here, and I don't even have a clean small cloth shirt to wear! Really! Is this my poor fate for life? Who's to blame? Alas!" After sighing, the woman snipped two hard snips, threw the scissors down, glanced at YuBao twice, then picked up the scissors again, busy while sighing.
　　YuBao was used to hearing these unpleasant words from the woman; however, today he seemed to be burdened with worries, unable to tolerate these words, and he suddenly stood up, slapped his thigh and said, "Humph! I haven't heard you say anything else! Can't you change your tune? You wait! Zhang YuBao's luck will start from today!" The woman laughed "hehehe" twice, and coldly replied, "Blow hard! Blow the pig bladder as big as you want! But my dear YuBao brother! Be careful, if you blow it too big, it'll 'pop', and break!" The woman threw down the scissors again, pointed at YuBao's forehead and said, "Didn't you say you were going to open a kiln for Master XiLu and be a foreman last year? You blew the bubble prettier than a glass ball, but what happened? Don't you remember? Truly, the blessed are forgetful!" YuBao didn't listen to these words, but sat on the edge of the kang again, took out the big opium pellet packet, patted the woman on the shoulder and said, "Quiet! You can say whatever you want, but look at this! Is this something to be blown?" The woman glanced at it, and casually slapped YuBao's face, scolding, "I told you not to smoke, and you're starting again! You wouldn't even get me an extra chi of cloth, but you have the money to buy this!" YuBao got anxious and said, "Oh, my dear sister! Why are you getting physical? Do you know who gave this to me?" The woman said, "Who gave it to you? Isn't it the county magistrate, the governor, and the warlord Yan sending it to Zhang YuBao to nourish his body and lift his spirits?" YuBao laughed, "Keep your voice down! Although this person can't compare to the county magistrate and the governor, he's someone who clenches fists and drinks with them at the table! I'll tell you!" Saying that, YuBao grabbed the woman's head, put it to her ear and said, "This was given by the old man JuBao!" The woman's eyebrows jumped up, and she quickly asked, "Really? He old man..." YuBao stopped her, "Hey! Keep it down!" Then, he quickly stood up and ran to the kiln door to take a look, turned around and closed the kiln door, then pulled the woman to sit close to him, and told her everything about why JuBao had sought him out. The woman said, "What is he planning?" YuBao said, "Who can guess his old man's schemes!" "Then what do you plan to do?" "That's what I'm saying! I don't have a clear idea yet." "You must be careful! One glare from him can send someone to their death!" YuBao shook his head and said, "Death, anyway, he can't send me to my death! Isn't it just that he's jealous and dissatisfied that Master XiLu has opened a kiln!" The woman quickly grabbed YuBao's hand and said, "I think that's exactly what he's thinking! But he's pulling you in! Can you turn your back on Master XiLu?" YuBao didn't say anything, just opened the big opium pellet packet again, and the woman quickly went to the stove outside to get a kettle of boiling water, and YuBao poured water to swallow the opium pellet, while intentionally or unintentionally looking at the woman and smiling.

　　Originally, YuBao was also a lively character. He had mixed in the coal mine for ten years before and after. Although his skills weren't strong, he had once made friends with the shopkeeper of the Yilitai Mine in Xihé, got the shopkeeper a mistress, and the shopkeeper promoted him to be a foreman for two days. From then on, he carried this name and showed off his status. However, his abilities in the coal mine were indeed not great, and he didn't make a breakthrough. Later, he ran to Yangquan City and snatched the job of being a porter boss at the train station for two days. He didn't know how he found Master XiLu, and followed the direction of his energy, watched his facial expressions, and acted accordingly, flattering him, helping him run errands, delivering goods to Niangziguan in Shijiazhuang, and withdrawing money from Shouyang City; XiLu saw that he was still diligent and efficient, and treated him as a trusted aide, consulting him on many things, and entrusting them to him. This time, YuBao had put in a lot of effort to promote XiRen's opening of the kiln, before it was decided, but unexpectedly, DaSan came along. YuBao was of course very unhappy; but at the time, XiLu said to him: "You are not an outsider, I will tell you frankly: DaSan has seen more of the world than you in the coal mine, so you can be a idle foreman! Anyway, I can't do without you for other things." YuBao hated it in his heart, but he had to smile on his face and replied: "We are close like grandfather and grandson, is there any need to say that? Besides, with DaSan in this kiln, it's like a heavy rain after a long drought, I'm very happy!" Later, YuBao had a quarrel with DaSan twice, and YuBao would inevitably say a few words about DaSan's faults to XiLu, but XiLu, seeing what DaSan had done, had made his kiln quite good, and he was very happy in his heart, so he couldn't help but love DaSan's talents and skills. Therefore, he didn't listen to YuBao, but XiLu treated people peacefully, and out of consideration for the relationship, he pacified YuBao with kind words each time, and that was it; that time DaSan argued with YuBao, and DaSan proposed to fire YuBao, XiLu then found YuBao to teach him a lesson, persuaded him for a while, and gave him some money, forcing him to apologize to DaSan. But YuBao was a person who spent his life currying favor with others to gain an advantage, and if the wind wasn't right, he would find another master. He had suffered so much in the past half year, and although he said "We can't be estranged as a family", a knot had long been tied in his heart that could not be untied. Now that he had met JuBao treating him that way, he knew that this matter was beneficial to him, saw that this matter could untie the knot in his heart, how could his mind not be active? Besides, this was a good opportunity to climb up, a good opportunity that he could never have imagined in his life! To be honest: he had already decided on seven-tenths of giving JuBao a hand, with only three-tenths still in doubt.

　　黑石坡煤窑演义（８）
    康  濯
    八商议
    玉宝从聚宝家出来，装着一肚子心事，别闷的不行，就顺道上牛宝家去。
    牛宝不在家，玉宝就一直进了牛宝他嫂的窑洞。那女人正把一块新白洋布铺在炕上，手里拿了件旧小布衫，在白布上比划着裁衣裳；这时见玉宝进去了，就把手里的旧布衫往炕上一撂，眼珠朝玉宝斜瞟了一下，噘着嘴说：“看你这布！这也是洋布哩！一指头就通个窟窿！”说着，又把玉宝一推：“叫你拉六尺的，你非拉五尺！你看，我这比划了一前晌，横着裁竖着裁怎么也不够！呃！亏你是个好心！”玉宝这时那有闲工夫想这些，就往炕沿一坐，支吾着道：“你看你又噘嘴瞪眼的！我不是说过么？这会我手头紧，赶手头富裕些，我再……”女人抢着道：“赶你手头富裕些！富裕些！人家又不是三岁两岁，那么好哄骗么？哼！我看你一辈子也摸不着个手头富裕！”说完，女人又把玉宝一推道：“去！坐到一边去！人家要在这裁衣裳嘛！”玉宝让到一边，女人就寻剪子尺子的，一边忙着，一边叹息道：“唉！端午节都眼看到啦，连个干净小布衫也穿不上！真是！这一辈子就这么个穷命嘛，怨谁？唉！”叹息完，女人就狠狠地剪两剪子，把剪子一丢，朝玉宝瞟上两眼，再拿起剪子，又一边忙一边叹息。
    女人这些不入耳的话，玉宝倒是听惯了的；不过，今天他却象是闷了一肚子心事，容不下这些话一般，不知怎么一来，他忽地往起一站，手拍大腿说：“哼！就再没听见你说过别的！你那嘴也不换个口味？你等着！我张玉宝交红运就从今个开头！”女人“嘿嘿嘿”笑了两声，冷冷地答道：“使劲吹吧！猪尿泡要吹多大吹多大！可我个玉宝哥哥！小心吹大了就‘叭’，破啦！”女人又把剪子一丢，手指玉宝脑门心道：“去年不是说给喜禄爷开窑当领事？尿泡吹得比琉璃球还漂亮，可怎么着？你记不得了？真是有福之人忘性大！”玉宝不听这些，又往炕沿一坐，掏出那个大烟丸包包，拍着女人肩膀道：“悄悄的！你说什么也由你，可你看看这！这也是吹？”女人眼一瞟，顺手就往玉宝脸上打了一巴掌，骂道：“说不抽不抽的，又闹开了这！连一尺布也不肯多拉，买这就手头富裕啦！”玉宝急了，忙道：“好我个姐姐！你怎么动手动脚？你知道这是谁给的？”女人道：“谁给的？还不是县长州官阎督军送给张玉宝养身子提精神的么？”玉宝笑道：“你悄悄的吧！这人虽说比不上县长州官，可也是跟县长州官桌面上划拳喝酒的人物！告你吧！”说着，玉宝一把抱住女人的脑袋，对着她耳根说：“这是聚宝老人家给的！”女人眉眼往起一跳，忙问：“真的么？他老人家……”玉宝堵住她道：“嗨！悄悄的嘛！”接着，忙站起来跑到窑门口看了看，回头关住了窑门，这才拉着女人紧挨着坐下，把刚才聚宝找他的情由，一五一十学给了她。女人道：“他这安的什么心思？”玉宝说：“谁可猜透了他老人家的机谋呀！”“那你盘算怎么对付？”“可就说嘛！我还没个准主意。”“你可小心啊！他老人家一瞪眼就能叫人送命的！”玉宝摇着脑袋道：“送命，反正也送不了我的命！他老人家还不是见喜禄爷开了窑，眼红心不服嘛！”女人忙抓住玉宝的手道：“我捉摸他也准是这么个心思！可人家这是拉你啊！你能一翻脸就不认喜禄爷？”玉宝没说什么，只是又解开了那个大烟丸包包，女人忙去外面炉子上提来一把开壶，玉宝就一边倒水吞大烟丸，一边有意无意地瞅着女人笑。
    原来玉宝也是个跑跳人物。他前前后后也曾在窑底下混过十来年，虽说把式不强，可是有一回他在西河义立泰交结上了矿上掌柜的，给掌柜的拉了根皮条，找了个好媳妇，那掌柜的就升他当了两天领事，从此他就背着这个名摆摆架势。不过他窑坑里的能耐的确不大，没闯开，后来就跑阳泉市，在火车站上抢着当过两天脚夫头，又不知怎么找上了他喜禄爷，顺着人家的劲头说话，看着人家的眼色作事，溜溜舐舐，帮忙跑腿，给下石家庄娘子关拉送个货，去寿阳城取个款；喜禄见他人还勤快，办事利索，就把他当亲信的禄看待，好多事都跟他商量，靠托给他。这回喜人开窑，原也是玉宝在一边使了老大的力气给吹吹打打，才决定了的，不想玉宝领事还没当上，就来了个大三，玉宝当然很不痛快；但当时喜禄对他说：“你也不是外人，我说个痛快：大三窑底下见的世面比你多，你就当闲工头吧！反正别的事情我也离不了你。”玉宝恨在心里，可也只好笑在脸上，答道：“咱亲爷爷亲孙孙的，这还用说？再说，这窑有了大三爷，真好比天红地旱下大雨，我正欢喜哩！”后来玉宝跟大三闹过两回，玉宝就短不了跟喜禄说两句大三的毛病，但喜禄这人眼见大三所作所为，把自己的窑闹得挺不赖，心中正是一阵阵高兴，不免就也爱上了大三的人材把式，因此便不听玉宝的，只是喜禄待人平和，碍着点情面，每回好言好语安插玉宝两句就算了；那回大三跟玉宝嚷嘴，大三提出要下玉宝的工，喜禄这才找玉宝教化了两句，规劝了一阵，又给了他几个钱，硬拉他给大三赔了个不是。但玉宝是一辈子巴结人占上风，风不顺就另找主的人物，这半年生生吃了那么些亏，嘴上虽是“咱一家子可不能见外”，心下却早结了个疙瘩，怎么也磨化不开。现在碰上聚宝那么待他，他明知这事对自己的便宜，看见这事能解开心上的疙瘩，心眼怎么会不活动？再说，这也正是个往上爬的好机会，是他一辈子想也想不到的好机会呀！老实说：他早就七成决定了要给聚宝干干，只剩下三成还在疑疑思思罢了。
