　　CCP Central Committee Issues Statement
　　Protesting Barbaric Trials by US, Australia, and Greece
　　Warning the Three Governments to Rescind Reactionary Judgments and Restore Freedom to Persecuted Revolutionary Leaders
　　The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China today issued a statement protesting the reactionary governments of the United States, Australia, and Greece for their barbaric persecution of the people's leaders in their respective countries. The full text of the statement is as follows:
　　Judge Medina of the United States Federal Court in New York, on October 21st, sentenced the General Secretary of the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States, Dennis, and committee members Winston, Stacher, Williamson, Gates, Green, Winter, Hall, Botaish, and Davis to five years of imprisonment and a fine of $10,000 each on the so-called charge of "inciting the violent overthrow of the United States government." Medina also sentenced the six lawyers who defended the leaders of the Communist Party of the United States to imprisonment ranging from four to six months.
　　Simultaneous with the US reactionaries' barbaric attack on the basic human rights of the American people, and under the instigation of the US reactionaries, the Melbourne Supreme Court on October 17th sentenced the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Australia, Sharkey, to three years of imprisonment for the so-called "crime of uttering treasonous statements," and the Athens Military Tribunal on October 13th sentenced Greek revolutionary women's leader Katelin Taragani and other revolutionary leaders Iliopoulos, Strelakos, Muratidis, Balbunakis, Saragis, and others to death.
　　The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China firmly protests these three reactionary and barbaric judgments, and warns the United States Supreme Court, the Australian government, and the Athens government to rescind these judgments and restore the freedom of the sentenced revolutionary leaders.
　　The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China declares: Based on its consistent and faithful internationalist stance, the Communist Party of China will, together with all true internationalists in the world, unite more closely with the Communist Party of the United States, the Communist Party of Australia, and the Communist Party of Greece, and more diligently support their just struggles for the interests of their own people and the interests of world peace.
　　The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that the reactionary trials in New York, Melbourne, and Athens do not indicate the strength and stability of the reactionary forces in various countries, but rather express their fear of their own imminent demise. The international reactionaries, led by the United States imperialist government, have suffered defeat in the main positions due to the resolute resistance of the Soviet Union, the people's democratic countries, China, and the people of the world. Its war intimidation has aroused the resentment of the world and has gone bankrupt, and it is facing the threat of economic and political crises. The United States and the reactionary governments it controls are therefore particularly afraid of the progressive forces among their own people, and therefore frantically adopt Hitler-style methods to persecute the reliable fortress of progressive forces in various countries—the Communist Parties. But this kind of persecution can never achieve the goal of preserving the rule of the reactionaries. On the contrary, the people of the world will be further awakened, united, and strengthened by recognizing the hideous faces of the reactionaries. The people of the world will realize what Dennis, Sharkey, Taragani, and other heroic revolutionary leaders have contributed their freedom and lives for, and will be determined to embark on the great road they have pointed out, and overthrow the evil imperialism.
　　Long live the Communist Party of the United States, the Communist Party of Australia, and the Communist Party of Greece, who bravely resist imperialism! Long live the victory of the liberation struggle of the working people of the world!
　　Central Committee of the Communist Party of China

    抗议美澳希野蛮审判            
    警告三国政府务必取消反动判决恢复被迫害的革命领袖们的自由
    【新华社北京三十日电】中国共产党中央委员会本日为抗议美国、澳大利亚、希腊三国反动政府对三国人民领袖实行野蛮迫害一事，发表声明。声明全文如下：
    美国纽约联邦法院法官麦迪纳，在十月二十一日以所谓“教唆以暴力颠覆美国政府”的罪名，判决美国共产党全国委员会总书记但尼斯和委员温斯顿、史塔彻、威廉姆森、盖兹、格林、温脱、贺尔、鲍塔许、戴维斯各处徒刑五年和罚金一万美元，委员汤普森处徒刑三年和罚金一万美元。麦迪纳并判处为美国共产党领袖辩护的六位律师以四个月至六个月的徒刑。
    与美国反动派对于美国人民基本人权实行野蛮进攻同时，并在美国反动派的号召之下，墨尔本最高法院在十月十七日以所谓“发表叛国言论罪”判处澳大利亚共产党总书记夏基徒刑三年，雅典军事法庭在十月十三日对希腊革命妇女领袖卡特林·塔拉甘尼和其他革命领袖伊利奥波洛斯，斯特列拉科斯，穆拉梯迪斯，巴尔布纳基斯，萨拉吉斯等人判处死刑。
    中国共产党中央委员会坚决地抗议这三个反动的野蛮的判决，并警告美国最高法院、澳大利亚政府和雅典政府务必取消这些判决，恢复被判决的革命领袖们的自由。
    中国共产党中央委员会声明：中国共产党根据自己的一贯地忠实的国际主义的立场，将和世界上一切真正的国际主义者一道，与美国共产党、澳大利亚共产党和希腊共产党更加巩固地团结一致，更加努力地支援它们为本国人民利益和世界和平利益而进行的正义斗争。
    中国共产党中央委员会认为：纽约、墨尔本和雅典的反动审判，不是表示各国反动势力的强大稳固，而是表示了它们对于自己临近死亡的恐惧。以美国帝国主义政府为首的国际反动派，已因苏联、各人民民主国家、中国和全世界人民的坚决抗击而在主要的阵地上遭受失败，它的战争恫吓引起全世界的愤恨并陷于破产，它正面临着经济危机和政治危机的威胁。美国及其所控制的各国反动政府因此就特别害怕本国人民中的进步力量，因此就疯狂地采用希特勒式的方法迫害各国进步力量的可靠堡垒——各国共产党。但是这种迫害是决不能达到保存反动派统治的目的的。相反地，全世界人民都将因为认识了反动派的狰狞面目而进一步警醒起来，团结起来。全世界人民将觉悟到但尼斯、夏基、塔拉甘尼和其他英勇的革命领袖们是为何而贡献了他们的自由和生命，而决心走上他们所指出的伟大道路，打倒万恶的帝国主义。
    英勇反抗帝国主义的美国共产党、澳大利亚共产党和希腊共产党万岁！世界劳动人民解放斗争胜利万岁！
    中国共产党中央委员会
    一九四九年十月三十日
