　　The Sino-Soviet Friendship Hall I Saw
　　Xie Deming
　　Before us are beautifully decorated display shelves, lovely decorations, and portraits immersed in red flags—portraits of the great teachers of freedom-loving humanity, Lenin and Stalin, and portraits of the leader of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong, artistically rendered by artists.
　　On every display shelf, in every picture and photograph, in every diagram and chart—everything makes one feel a pair of loving hands, feel that they display much genuine creation and originality.
　　If people did not cherish Sino-Soviet friendship, how could they have arranged this exhibition hall with such love? No, absolutely not!
　　Only those who wholeheartedly strive to consolidate Sino-Soviet friendship and strive to understand the great truth of socialist countries can arrange such an exhibition hall. This is the first conclusion I drew after visiting the hall.
　　But this is only the appearance; let us look at the content.
　　I carefully observed the photo display racks, slogans, mottos, pictures, and diagrams. From the smallest exhibits to the huge "Friendship," everything is permeated with one spirit: to consolidate the indestructible friendship with the Soviet people, to learn from the Soviet Union, and to follow the path of the Russians.
　　"The Communist Party of the Soviet Union is our best teacher. We should learn from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union." - This instruction from Chairman Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people, has been taken as the foundation of the exhibition.
　　"Long live Sino-Soviet friendship" is a slogan that prevails not only in the "Friendship" Hall but also in all the exhibition halls. "Friendship"—what a meaningful and hopeful word. People call out the word "friendship" in the languages of various countries and nations.
　　For the enemies of the people, the word "friendship" is a piece of covering paper they attempt to use to conceal their hideous faces.
　　The enemies of freedom-loving humanity, while mouthing "friendship," exhibit such evil hypocrisy, such disrespect, and such base cynicism.
　　Imperialist countries once concluded treaties with China that were most shameful to the Chinese people, but they called these treaties "friendship."
　　In 1842, British colonial rulers concluded the first unequal treaty with China, opening Guangzhou, Xiamen, Ningbo, Fuzhou, and Shanghai as British trading ports. Hong Kong was transferred to the British for "perpetual use."
　　British soldiers acted arrogantly as conquerors in China. The atrocities they committed against peaceful residents are indescribable.
　　Karl Marx, the great founder of scientific communism, wrote: "Raping women, impaling children on bayonets, and burning entire villages of residents, these facts, noticed not only by Chinese officials but also by British officers, were merely for obscene pranks at the time."
　　The British colonial rulers solemnly declared that they had concluded "the first treaty of peace, friendship, and trade with China, and China signed the treaty on a new equal basis"—this is the rhetoric of the British pirates using "friendly" treaties to cover up their plunder.
　　In 1844, the United States signed a treaty with China called "Friendship, Trade, and Navigation." This "friendly" treaty gave the United States the right to plunder China as shamelessly as other countries.
　　More than a hundred years later, the United States concluded the "Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation" with China in 1946, which was even more humiliating than the notorious Japanese Twenty-One Demands.
　　And even after the complete failure of the United States' policy toward China, Secretary of State Acheson brazenly stated in his letter to Truman: "We now support and will continue to develop our friendly relations with China." (See Acheson's letter to Truman)
　　The "friendship" with China supported by the imperialists is reminiscent of the friendship of mounted knights, the friendship of wolves with lambs in their mouths, and the friendship of pythons swallowing rabbits.
　　But there is another kind of friendship, and that is when friendship is based on sincerity, humanity, respect, and the principle of mutual assistance, then friendship reflects the will and expectations of the people and means genuine help to friends in need.
　　What is noteworthy in the Friendship Hall is the dazzling metal shield engraved with the most important dates in Sino-Soviet relations. The shield reads: "November 7, 1917, after the success of the October Socialist Revolution in Russia, it issued a declaration to the Eastern countries, taking the initiative to renounce all illegal rights of the Tsarist government in these countries.
　　On July 26, 1919, and September 27, 1920, Soviet Russia successively issued two declarations to China, stating that the Soviet Russian government renounced all unequal treaties and the Boxer Indemnity of the Tsarist government in China. Afterwards, Soviet Russia sent people to China three times to negotiate and concluded the 'Sino-Russian Agreement.'
　　In December 1923, Soviet Russia sent advisors to China to help Sun Yat-sen lead the Guangdong government and establish the Whampoa Military Academy.
　　On May 31, 1924, under the pressure of the people, the Chinese Beijing government established diplomatic relations with Soviet Russia and signed the 'Sino-Russian Agreement.' The Soviet Russian government took the initiative to renounce various privileges and the Boxer Indemnity of the Tsarist government in China.
　　After the 'September 18 Incident' in 1931, the Soviet Union did not recognize the establishment of the puppet 'Manchukuo.'
　　On August 21, 1937, the Soviet Union and China signed a non-aggression treaty and provided China with a large amount of material assistance in the War of Resistance Against Japan.
　　After the 'July 7 Incident' in 1937, China received US$450 million in material assistance from the Soviet Union during the War of Resistance Against Japan, and a large number of air force volunteers participated in China's War of Resistance Against Japan.
　　On August 9, 1945, the Soviet government declared war on Japan. The 'Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance' was signed on the 14th. On the 15th, Japanese imperialism announced its unconditional surrender under the attack of the Soviet Union. On the 22nd, the Soviet Union completely liberated Northeast China and Lushun-Dalian. On September 2nd, Japan signed the unconditional surrender document, thus ending World War II, and this day became the Soviet Union's Victory Day over Japan.
　　In July 1949, the Northeast and the Soviet Union signed a 'One-Year Trade Agreement.'"
　　In addition to these dates, one should add the most significant day, October 2, 1949—the Soviet Union was the first to establish diplomatic relations with the government of the People's Republic of China.
　　These dates have nothing in common with the dates of the imperialists' relations with China since the Opium War in 1840 and the treaties they concluded.
　　These dates are clear proof of the sincere friendship of the Soviet Union toward the great Chinese people.
　　At the end of the visit to this exhibition hall, I was very interested in the suggestion book. When I read the enthusiastic opinions of ordinary Soviet people about the "Friendship" Hall, I couldn't help but be moved.
　　Li Zhujun, a staff member of the hall, said to me: "Please tell me the opinions written by Soviet people in the suggestion book about our hall. We all want to know what Soviet people think of our exhibition hall? What are their thoughts on Sino-Soviet friendship?"
　　Li Zhujun stared at my eyes intently. She waited eagerly and interestedly for my reply.
　　What ordinary Soviet people think of the Chinese people and what they think of Sino-Soviet friendship—this is not only what I want to tell her, but also what I want to tell all friends of the Soviet people.
　　Several Soviet soldiers wrote in the suggestion book:
　　"After visiting the Friendship Hall, several Soviet soldiers are extremely satisfied with everything and deeply grateful for the correct path chosen by the Chinese people—the path that is leading the Chinese people to a happy life and towards communism.
　　Long live Sino-Soviet friendship!
　　Long live Comrade Stalin and Comrade Mao Zedong!" October 2, 1949. On behalf of several Soviet people: (Illegible signature).
　　"What a wonderful impression the exhibition, and especially the 'Friendship' Hall, gave me.
　　We rejoice in the creation of the Chinese people, who are heading towards an ideal future under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party. Let Sino-Soviet friendship be continuously consolidated!" September 25, 1949. Several Soviet soldiers.
　　Several Soviet sailors on the ship "Smolny" wrote: "Several sailors on the ship 'Smolny' rejoice in the 'Friendship' Hall. All the work has been completed perfectly." On behalf of several sailors—(Unclear signature).
　　Soviet citizen Vinogurov wrote:
　　"The exhibition hall is very well arranged. It very well reflects the love and respect of the people of democratic China for the Soviet Union and Comrade Stalin.
　　The hall clearly reflects the profound friendship between democratic China and the Soviet Union." September 27, 1949. Vinogurov.
　　Opinion of Lieutenant Saldokov:
　　"I am particularly pleased with the exhibits showing the indestructible friendship between China and the Soviet Union." September 29, 1949, Lieutenant Saldokov.
　　Opinion of Soviet citizen Sliekhin:
　　"After visiting this exhibition hall, I feel extremely satisfied. I rejoice in the selfless labor of the Chinese people.
　　I am convinced that such a people—heroes under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the leader of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong—will quickly build a socialist society, and then they will go hand in hand with the friendly Soviet people and move forward to build communism.
　　Long live Sino-Soviet friendship!
　　Long live Comrade Stalin and Comrade Mao Zedong!" October 2, 1949. Sliekhin.
　　Here I have only excerpted a part of the opinions of Soviet people. They show how Soviet people treat the new China, the Chinese people, and their leader, Mao Zedong.
　　People come from all directions of the People's Republic of China to visit the industrial exhibition. They will definitely visit the "Friendship" Hall. They will see the greatness of the Soviet Union there. They will hear the truth about the great socialist country, the indestructible great friendship between China and the Soviet Union, the great leader of freedom-loving humanity, Stalin, and the great leader of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong.
　　They will bring what they see and hear to every corner of the new China.

### 我所见到的中苏友谊馆

　　我所见到的中苏友谊馆
    谢德明
    我们眼前是装饰得很漂亮的陈列架，装饰得令人可爱的、沉浸在红旗中的画像——爱好自由人类的伟大导师列宁和斯大林的画像，和经过美术家的艺术手法所绘成的中国人民的领袖毛泽东的画像。
    在每一陈列架上，每一幅图画和像片里，在每一张图解和图表上——所有一切都使人感到有一双可爱的手，感到它们显示出许多真正的创作和首创精神。
    人们如果不珍贵中苏友谊的话，他们又岂能如此热爱地布置这所陈列馆呢？不会的，绝不会的！
    只有那些全心全意力求巩固中苏友谊、力求了解社会主义国家伟大真理的人，才能布置出这样的陈列馆来。这就是我参观该馆后所得出的第一个结论。
    但这仅是外表，我们再看看内容。
    我曾仔细观察了照像陈列架、标语、口号、图画和图解。从细小的展览品起到巨大的“友谊”为止，一切都贯穿着一个精神：巩固与苏联人民不可摧毁的友谊，向苏联学习，走俄国人的路。
    “联共是我们最好的先生。我们应向联共学习。”——中国人民领袖毛泽东主席的这个指示，已被作为展览会的基础了。
    “中苏友谊万岁”这句口号，不仅在“友谊”馆而且也在所有的展览馆中流行着。“友谊”——这是一个多么意味深长和富有希望的字眼。人们用各个国家和民族的语言呼唤着“友谊”这个字。
    对人民的敌人说来，“友谊”这个字是他们企图用来掩饰自己狰狞面目的遮羞纸。
    爱好自由人类的敌人，一面是满口“友谊”，而表现出的却是何等邪恶的伪善、何等的不敬和何等低级的犬儒主义。
    帝国主义国家曾与中国缔结了对中国人民说是最可耻的条约，但他们把这些条约称作是“友谊”。
    一八四二年，英国殖民统治者与中国缔结了第一个不平等条约，将广州、厦门、宁波、福州和上海五埠开作英国通商口岸。香港则转交英国人“永远使用”。
    英国兵士在中国悍然以征服者自居。他们对和平居民所采取的兽行，实在无法描述。
    科学共产主义的伟大创始人马克思写道：“强奸妇女、把小孩挑在枪刺上、火烧整村的居民，这些不仅为中国官吏而也为不列颠军官们所注意到的事实，当时只不过是为了荒淫的恶作剧而如此”。
    英国的殖民统治者慎重其事地宣称，他们与中国订立了“第一个和平友谊的条约和贸易条约，中国并在新的平等基础上在条约上签了字”——这就是用“友好的”条约来掩饰其掠夺行为的英国海盗的词令。
    一八四四年，美国与中国签订了名为“友好、贸易和航海”的条约。这一“友好”条约给了美国以与其他国家同等地无耻地掠夺中国的权利。
    一百多年后，美国又在一九四六年与中国缔结了比有名的日本二十一条尤为屈辱的“友好通商航海”条约。
    而甚至就在美国对华政策完全失败之后，国务卿艾奇逊尚在其致杜鲁门的信中厚颜无耻地声称：“我们现在支持并将继续发展我们与中国的友好关系上。”（见艾奇逊致杜鲁门信）
    帝国主义者这样支持的与中国的“友谊”，使人想起马上骑士的友谊、想起口衔羔羊的豺狼和吞食小兔的巨蟒的友谊。
    但另外还有一种友谊，那就是当友谊以诚意、人道、尊敬和互助原则为基础的时候，那时的友谊才反映出人民的志愿和期望，才意味着对陷于困境的朋友的真正帮助。
    友谊馆中使人注意的是刻有中苏关系最重要日期的耀眼的金属盾牌。牌上写着：“一九一七年十一月七日，俄国在十月社会主义革命成功后，即向东方各国发出宣言，主动放弃沙皇政府时代在这些国家的一切不合法权利。
    一九一九年七月二十六日与一九二○年九月二十七日，苏俄先后发表两次对华宣言，声明苏俄政府放弃沙皇政府在中国的一切不平等条约和庚子赔款。之后苏俄三次派人来华谈判，订立了‘中俄协定’。
    一九二三年十二月，苏俄派顾问来华，帮助孙中山领导广东政府，创设黄埔军官学校。
    一九二四年五月三十一日，中国北京政府在人民的压力下始与苏俄建立两国外交关系，并签订‘中俄协定’，苏俄政府主动放弃沙皇政府在华的各种特权与庚子赔款等。
    一九三一年‘九一八’事变发生后，苏联对伪‘满洲国’的成立未予承认。
    一九三七年八月二十一日，苏联与中国签订了互不侵犯条约，并以大量物资援助中国抗战。
    一九三七年‘七七事变’，在中国在抗战期间得到苏联的物资援助达四万万五千万美元，并有大批空军志愿队参加中国对日抗战。
    一九四五年八月九日，苏联政府对日宣战。十四日签订了‘中苏友好同盟条约’。十五日日本帝国主义在苏联打击下宣布无条件投降。二十二日苏联完全解放东北、旅大。九月二日日本签订无条件投降书，就此结束第二次世界大战，而这天成为苏联战胜日本的胜利节。
    一九四九年七月，东北与苏联签订‘一年贸易协定’。”
    除这些日期外，还应加上一个最有意义的日子一九四九年十月二日——苏联与中华人民共和国政府第一个建立外交关系。
    这些日期与一八四○年鸦片战争以来帝国主义者与中国发生关系的日期和所缔结的条约丝毫没有共通之处。
    这些日期是苏联对伟大的中国人民所持真诚的友好态度的鲜明证明。
    在这个展览馆参观到最后的时候，使我颇感兴趣的是意见书。当我读到一般苏联人对“友谊”馆的激动的意见时，真不能不为之所动。
    该馆工作人员李竹君对我说：“请告诉我苏联人在意见书中所写的对我们这一馆的意见。我们都想知道，苏联人对我们的展览馆有些什么观感？他们对中苏友谊有什么感想？”
    李竹君目不转睛的望着我的眼睛。她急切地很感兴味地等着我的答复。
    平常的苏联人对中国人民的感想和对中苏友谊的感想如何——这不仅是我要告诉她的，而且是我要告诉苏联人民的一切友人的。
    几位苏联战士在意见书上写道：
    “几个苏联战士参观了友谊馆之后，对一切都异常满意，并深深感谢中国人民所选择的正确道路——正把中国人民引向幸福生活的走向共产主义的道路。
    中苏友谊万岁！
    斯大林同志与毛泽东同志万岁！”一九四九年十月二日。谨代表几个苏联人：（签字不清）。
    “展览会而尤其是‘友谊’馆给了我多么美好的印象。
    我们为在光荣的中国共产党领导下走向理想的将来的中国人民的创作而欢欣。让中苏友谊不断地巩固吧！”一九四九年九月二十五日。几个苏联战士。
    “斯莫尔尼”号轮船上的几个苏联水兵写道：“‘斯莫尔尼’号轮船的几个水兵为‘友谊’馆而欢欣。一切工作均已美满完成”。谨代表几个水兵——（署名不清）。
    苏联公民维诺古洛夫写道：
    “展览馆布置得非常好。很好地反映出民主中国的人民对苏联、对斯大林同志的爱和尊敬。
    馆内清楚地反映出民主中国与苏联的深厚友谊”。一九四九年九月二十七日。维诺古洛夫。
    中尉萨尔都可夫的意见：
    “展示出中苏不可摧毁的友谊的展览品特别使我高兴”。一九四九年九月二十九日中尉萨尔都可夫。
    苏联公民斯列赫金的意见：
    “参观了这一展览馆之后，我感到异常满意。我为中国人民奋不顾身的劳动而欢欣。
    我深信，这样的人民——在中国共产党和中国人民的领袖毛泽东领导下的英雄，会迅速建立起社会主义社会，之后又将与友谊的苏联人民并驾齐驱，往前建立共产主义。
    中苏友谊万岁！
    斯大林同志和毛泽东同志万岁！”一九四九年十月二日。斯列赫金。
    此处我仅摘录了苏联人的一部分意见。它们表明苏联人怎样对待新中国、中国人民及其领袖毛泽东。
    人们自中华人民共和国的四方来参观工业展览会。他们一定会参观“友谊”馆。他们将在那里见到苏联的伟大。他们将在那里听到关于伟大的社会主义国家、中苏两国不可摧毁的伟大友谊、爱好自由的人类的伟大领袖斯大林以及中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东的真理。
    他们将把所见所闻带到新中国的每一个角落。
