　　Answer to Questions (Answering questions from an American magazine)
　　By Gorky Translated by Li Wei

　　You ask:
　　"Does your country hate America? What is your opinion of American civilization?"

　　Posing such questions in such a way reveals that some aspects are terribly exaggerated and affected by typical American style. I cannot imagine a European asking such questions to "make money." But I must tell you: to your first question—as with all the others—I have no right to answer on behalf of my country's 150 million people, because I have no way to ask them what they think of your country.

　　In the Philippines, in the South American countries, in China, your capitalists are minting coins with the blood of these countries. I think that even in these countries, even among the ten million Black people in America, you won't find a single intelligent person daring to say on behalf of his people: "Yes, my country, my people hate America; hate all Americans; hate the American tycoons, and also the workers; hate white people, and also black people; hate women and children, fields, rivers, forests, and birds and beasts; hate the past and the present; hate science and scientists; hate Edison and Burbank L., Poe E., Whitman, Washington and Lincoln, Dreiser and O'Neill, Anderson S.; hate all American genius artists: the outstanding and sentimental Bret Harte—the spiritual father of Jack London, hate Thoreau H., Emerson and everything that constitutes the United States of America and all the people living in the American states."

　　I hope you are not trying to find an utter idiot who would give such a crazy answer to your question, an answer filled with hatred of the people and culture.

　　But, of course, what you call American civilization does not and cannot evoke my sympathy. I think your civilization is the most畸形civilization on this planet, because it amplifies many of the shameful deformities of European civilization to a terrifying degree. Europe is tragically corrupted by the coldness of the national class structure; but Europe still cannot produce anything as viciously stupid as your millionaires and multi-millionaires (whose contribution to your country is decadence). You naturally remember the Boston assassination case—two wealthy young men killed another young man purely out of curiosity, remember? How many such crimes are there in your country, crimes due to curiosity, just to "show off"? Europe can also boast that its citizens are deprived of their rights and are defenseless, but it has not degenerated to the point of committing the ugly incident of murdering Sacco and Vanzetti. France had the "Dreyfus Affair," which was embarrassing enough, but in France, there were Zola and Anatole France who stood up to defend the innocent victims and mobilized millions to take action. In Germany, after the war, something developed that was essentially of the same kind as the Ku Klux Klan—an organization of assassins—but in Germany, these people were captured and brought to justice; in your country, this is practically not the case. The Ku Klux Klan assassinates and shamelessly humiliates black people and black women; but they can all go scot-free, just as the governors can summarily execute socialist workers and go scot-free.

　　Europe does not have such a hateful thing as "mistreatment of black people," although Europe also suffers from another shameful disease—anti-Semitism, which America has also contracted.

　　Crimes are also gradually increasing in Europe, but they have not grown to—as your newspapers judge—like Chicago, where, in addition to the thugs of the stock exchange and the banks, there are thugs holding guns and bombs who do whatever they want. A gun battle caused by Prohibition could not happen in Europe; nor could there be a figure like the mayor of Chicago who would publicly burn English classics.

　　When the editor of the Nation magazine, Villard, invited Shaw to come to the United States, Shaw gave him a satirical reply. I don't believe Shaw had the right to answer the invitation of any other country so satirically.

　　The capitalists of all countries are a disgusting bunch, but your capitalists are worse, apparently they are more stupidly greedy for money. By the way, I personally translate the word "merchant" as "madman."

　　Think about how stupid and shameless it is: we are laboriously learning to decorate and enrich this beautiful planet... but now it is in the greedy hands of a group of useless people who only know how to make money. These blockheads transform the brilliant creativity of others—scientists, technicians, poets, and workers who build culture—our second nature, into small pieces of yellow metal and pieces of paper.

　　What have capitalists created besides money? Misanthropy, jealousy, greed, and hatred—this hatred will eventually destroy the capitalists, but endless cultural treasures may also perish with the capitalists because of the outbreak of hatred. Your morbidly bloated civilization threatens you with a tragic tragedy.

　　As for myself, my opinion is of course this: the real civilization and the rapid improvement of culture are only possible when political power is completely in the hands of the working people—not when it is in the hands of parasites who live off the labor of others. And of course, I would like to suggest declaring capitalists a group of people harmful to society, confiscating their property for the benefit of the country, and moving these people to an island in the ocean—let them die there quietly! This is a very humane way to solve social problems; and it is quite in line with "American Idealism." So-called American idealism is just the overly naive optimism of a few individuals who have not experienced the comedies and tragedies that, taken together, become "the history of the people."

　　答问　（回答一家美国杂志提出的问题）
    高尔基  作  厉苇  译
    您问：
    “贵国是否憎恨美国？阁下对美国文明有何意见？”
    提出这种问题，采取了这种方式，这就可以看出其中有些地方被典型的美国作风可怕地夸大造作了。我设想不出一个欧洲人会为了要“赚钱”提这样的问题。但是我必须告诉您：对您的第一个问题——跟对其余的一切问题一样——我无权代表鄙国一亿五千万人民作答，因为我没办法去问他们对贵国的看法如何。
    在菲律宾，在南美各国，在中国，你们的资本家正以这些国家的鲜血铸成钱币，我以为即使在这些国家里，即使在美国的一千万黑人里，也找不出一个聪明人，擅敢代表他的人民向您说：“不错，我的国家，我的人民都恨美国；恨一切美国人；恨美国的大阔佬，也恨工人；恨白人，也恨黑人；恨妇孺，田野，河流，森林和飞禽走兽；恨过去和现在；恨科学和科学家；恨爱迪生和布邦克（Ｂｕｒｂａｎｋ　Ｌ．），爱伽·坡（Ｐｏｅ　Ｅ．），惠特曼，华盛顿和林肯，德莱塞和奥涅尔，安得逊（ＡｎｄｅｒｓｏｎＳ．）；恨所有美国的天才艺术家：杰出的多情善感的哈特（Ｂｒｅｔ　Ｈａｒｔｅ）——杰克·伦敦精神上的父亲，恨索鲁（Ｔｈｏｒｅａｎ　Ｈ．），霭默生和一切组成美利坚合众国的事物以及一切住在美国各州的人民。
    但愿您并不打算找一个白痴透顶的人，会给予您的问题这样的一个癫狂的回答，这答案中充满对人民对文化的憎恨。
    但是，当然您所谓的美国文明并不也不可能激起我的同情。我以为您的文明是我们这星球上最畸形的文明，因为它把欧罗巴文明的众多可耻的畸形都放大到了可怖的程度。欧洲很悲惨地被国家阶级结构的冷酷腐蚀了；但是欧洲至今还提不出一件东西，能象贵国的百万富翁，千万富翁（他们对贵国的贡献就是堕落）那样恶毒愚蠢。您自然记得波斯吞暗杀案——两个有钱的年青人纯为好奇心的驱使杀死了另一个青年，记得吗？在贵国有多少这样的罪恶，犯罪由于好奇心，只由于要“出出风头”？欧洲也可以吹嘘说自己的公民们被剥夺了权益和毫无防御的情形，但还没有堕落到发生谋杀撒可（Ｓａｃｃｏ）和范杰蒂（Ｖａｎｚｅｔｔｉ）的丑事，法国有过“德雷弗斯案”，也够丢人的，但是在法国还有左拉和法朗士（Ａｎａｔｏｌｅ　Ｆｒａｎｃｅ）挺身而出卫护无辜的受难者，而且使千万人都参加了行动。在德国，战后也发展了本质上和三Ｋ党——暗杀者的组织——一流的某种东西，而在德国，这些人被捕获捉将官里去了；在贵国实际上却并非如此，三Ｋ党暗杀并且鲜廉寡耻地侮辱黑人和黑人妇女；但他们都可逍遥法外，正好象州长们简捷了当地处决了社会主义的工人，可以逍遥法外一样。
    欧洲没有象“虐待黑人”这样的令人憎恶的事情，虽说欧洲也苦于另一种可耻的病症——反犹太主义，其实美国也染上了这病。
    犯罪事件在欧洲也正逐渐增加，但是还没有成长到——象你们的报纸所判断的——象芝加哥那样，在芝加哥除了交易所和银行的匪徒以外，还有任所欲为的握有枪炮炸弹的匪徒。因为禁酒令而引起炮战，这在欧洲不可能发生；也不可能有一位象芝加哥市长那样的人物，竟会当众焚毁英文经典著作。
    民族杂志的编辑威拉（Ｖｉｌｌａｒｄ）邀请萧伯纳到美国来的时候，萧伯纳曾给他以嘲讽的回答，我不相信萧有权利这样讽刺地回答任何别的一国的邀请。
    一切国家的资本家都是令人作呕的一丘之貉，可是你们的资本家更糟，显然他们更愚蠢地贪婪着金钱。顺便说一句，“商人”这个字眼我个人把它译作“疯子”。
    想一想这是多么愚蠢无耻吧：我们在艰苦中学着修饰丰富了的这个美好的星球……如今却掌握在一群只会赚钱的一无用处的人们的贪婪的手里。这些笨头笨脑的几个人把别人的辉煌的创造力——科学家，技术家，诗人和建立起文化——我们的第二自然的劳动者的血汗，而将这创造力变成一小片一小片的黄色金属和一张张的支票。
    资本家们除了钱以外，还创造了什么？厌世，嫉妒，贪欲，以及憎恨——这憎恨最后要摧毁资本家的，但是无尽的文化宝藏也可能因为憎恨的爆发而与资本家同归于尽。你们的病态的臃肿的文明以凄惨的悲剧威胁着你们。
    至于我自己，我的意见当然是这样：真正的文明和文化的迅速提高只有在政权完全由劳动人民掌握时，才是可能的——不是当在依赖别人的劳动过活的寄生虫掌握中时。并且当然我愿意建议宣布资本家是一伙有害于社会的人，为国家的利益没收他们的财产，把这些人搬到大洋的某个岛上去——让他们在那里静静地死去吧！这是解决社会问题的一个很人道的办法；也颇与“美国理想主义”（Ａｍｅｒｉｃａｕ　Ｉｄｅａｌｉｓｍ）神合。所谓美国理想主义不过是几个个人的过分天真的乐观主义，这些个人还没有体验到总结起来便成为“人民的历史”的喜剧和悲剧。
