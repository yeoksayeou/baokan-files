　　Celebrating the Liberation of Guangzhou
　　Amidst the jubilation of the birth of New China, the People's Liberation Army on the Central China Front resolutely carried out Commander-in-Chief Zhu's order read during the military parade in the capital on October 1st, "to swiftly eliminate the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionary army and liberate all the territories that have not yet been liberated." On October 4th, they launched a powerful offensive, advancing swiftly westward and southward. In just over ten days, they liberated vast areas of western Hunan, southern Hunan, and northern Guangdong, annihilated the main force of the White bandit's four divisions and other remnant bandits, and victoriously captured Guangzhou on the 14th, overturning the coastal lair where the remnants of the Kuomintang bandit gang cruelly exploited the people of South China in a desperate struggle. We hereby extend our respects to the People's Liberation Army on the Central China Front and the people's armed forces who have persisted in the liberation areas of South China, and extend our cordial greetings to the people of Guangzhou and the vast new areas who have persisted in the revolutionary struggle amidst suffering and finally gained liberation.
　　In late April of this year, when the People's Liberation Army's million-strong army bravely crossed the Yangtze River and advanced to liberate Nanjing, the Kuomintang reactionary rule had already been declared dead, and the crumbling remnants of the bandit gang fled to Guangzhou in a panic. After staying in Guangzhou for less than six months, they were scattered and fled again under the iron fist of the People's Liberation Army. The telegram sent by the bandit gang from Guangzhou on the 12th "predicted" that bandit chiefs Li Zongren and Yan Xishan "would both leave Guangzhou for Chongqing on the 20th," but the PLA's capture of Guangzhou came several days earlier than their self-deceiving "prediction."
　　The remnants of the Kuomintang bandit gang are now truly scattered and fleeing in all directions, becoming the remnants of the remnants. Precisely because of this, they frantically carried out large-scale killings and destruction before fleeing Guangzhou, and the White bandit bandits committed even more evils along the way when fleeing southwest. But where can they escape to? How long can they continue to do evil? The officers and soldiers who are still in the remnant Kuomintang bandit gang have only one last chance to atone for their crimes by performing meritorious service for the people; if they do not find a way to escape and continue to wander and continue to be enemies of the people, they will certainly not escape the punishment of the people. The People's Liberation Army is continuing to advance into the southwestern and southeastern provinces, and the liberation of all of China is even closer. No imperialism can save their incurable, dying dogs. Let the whole world hear these words, these are the words of Fan Chuili, a combat hero of a certain unit of the Fourth Field Army, and the unanimous voice of all commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army: "We will celebrate the founding of the People's Republic of China with the victory of annihilating the remnant Jiang-Bai bandit army. We warn the imperialist war-mongers that the forces of peace and democracy in the world are incomparably powerful. We must stand with the forces of peace and democracy in the world, oppose imperialist aggression and new war conspiracies, defend the motherland, and defend world peace!"

### 庆祝广州解放

　　庆祝广州解放
    在新中国诞生的欢欣鼓舞中，华中前线人民解放军坚决执行朱总司令十月一日在首都阅兵时宣读的命令，为“迅速肃清国民党反动军队的残余，解放一切尚未解放的国土”，于十月四日发动了强大进攻，向西向南长驱直进。只不过十来天的时间，解放了湘西、湘南、粤北广大地区，歼灭了白匪主力四个师及其他残匪，于十四日胜利进克广州，掀掉了国民党匪帮残余残酷压榨华南人民作负隅挣扎的滨海巢穴。我们于此谨向华中前线各路解放军和坚持华南解放区的人民武装致敬，并向在苦难中坚持了革命斗争而终于获得解放的广州人民及广大新区人民致亲切的慰问。
    今年四月下旬，当人民解放军百万雄师勇猛渡江前进解放南京的时候，国民党反动统治即已宣告灭亡，土崩瓦解的匪帮残余，慌慌张张逃到了广州；在广州停留了还不到六个月，就又在人民解放军的铁拳下四散逃命了。匪帮于十二日从广州发出的电报，曾“预告”匪首李宗仁、阎锡山“均将于二十日离穗赴渝”，而解放军的攻入广州，比他们这个自欺欺人的“预告”却早了好几天。
    国民党匪帮残余现在真是七零八落，抱头四散，成为残余之残余了。正因为这样，他们在逃离广州前又疯狂地大肆屠杀、破坏，白匪流寇向西南逃命时沿途更作恶多端。可是他们还能逃到哪里安身呢？他们还能作孽到几时呢？至今还留在国民党匪帮残余集团里的官兵们，要想向人民立功赎罪，只有最后一个机会了；他们如再不设法脱身，还要继续流亡，继续与人民为敌，将一定逃不脱人民的惩罚。人民解放军正继续向西南、东南各省大举进军，全中国的解放已更加迫近了，任何帝国主义再也无法搭救他们所豢养的不可救药的垂死狗了。让全世界都听到这样几句话吧，这是第四野战军某部战斗英雄范垂礼的话，也是全体人民解放军指战员一致的声音：“我们要以全歼残余蒋白匪军的胜利，来庆祝中华人民共和国的成立。我们警告帝国主义战争贩子们，全世界和平民主的力量是无比强大的，我们一定要和世界和平民主力量在一起，反对帝国主义侵略和新战争阴谋，保卫祖国，保卫世界和平！”
