Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 1st: According to TASS reports: On the eve of the International Day of Struggle for Peace, the people's peace movements in France, Germany, Belgium, and Switzerland continue to surge. Parisian youth held a peace rally at the Cirque d'Hiver on the evening of the 29th. Tens of thousands of people attended the rally, which was presided over by World Federation of Democratic Youth Chairman, Boëlson. When the leaders of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, various French youth organizations, the French Communist Party, the French General Confederation of Labor, and other public organizations appeared on the stage, the attendees gave them prolonged applause. Boëlson delivered a brief speech to the rally, expressing his deep conviction that the French youth in attendance would honor the oath made in their name at Heroes' Square in Budapest: "Continue the struggle to defend peace until final victory." Several representatives who had participated in the Budapest World Youth Conference delivered speeches, stating that democratic youth were all prepared to wage an unwavering struggle to consolidate world peace and oppose warmongers, and they emphasized the great significance of the fact that the peace and democratic camp was headed by the Soviet Union. Thorez also spoke at the meeting, calling on French young men and women to unite in the fight for peace and a bright future for the youth.

The German peace movement is developing nationwide. Despite the repression by the British and American authorities, this movement has also penetrated West Germany. Among the 5.6 million people who signed the petition calling for an unconditional ban on atomic bombs, 360,000 were German women from the Western occupation zone. Last week's peace demonstration at Lustgarten Square gathered 500,000 people under the slogan of peace, many of whom had slipped over from the Western occupation zone, evading the Western police blockade.

The Belgian Peace Committee and the Belgian Women's League for Peace are actively preparing for the International Day of Struggle for Peace on October 2nd throughout the country. At the rallies and mass meetings held for peace, the committees of these organizations explain to the people the resolutions of the Paris World Peace Congress and the work of the Soviet Peace Conference held in Moscow. On October 2nd, mass peace rallies will be held in major Belgian cities – Antwerp, Charleroi, Bruges, Liège, Ostend, Tournai, Namur, Mons, and others. Peace teams will travel from various provinces to Brussels, where a mass meeting will be held at the Flandre Cinema in Brussels. Many cities are preparing concerts and film screenings to celebrate.

A peace conference was also held in Stockholm, Sweden, recently, under the auspices of the Swedish Peace Committee. Speakers at the conference unanimously denounced the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty and expressed their determination to defend peace.
