　　Democratic National Construction Association Spokesperson Issues Statement
    Welcoming the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations Between the Soviet Union and Other Countries
    [This Municipality News] The spokesperson of the Democratic National Construction Association recently issued a statement regarding the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and other countries with our nation, stating: On the second day after the founding of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China was announced, our great ally, the Soviet Union, established diplomatic relations with our people's government. Bulgaria, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and other new democratic countries in Eastern Europe have also successively established diplomatic relations with our government. This truly cannot help but make us feel unparalleled glory and extraordinary excitement. This proves that only the socialist Soviet Union has the ideal and the ability to lead all progressive, peace-loving, and democratic forces in the world; only the socialist Soviet Union and the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe will truly sympathize with and assist our country and government, which belong to the people. Because their own countries and governments also belong to the people. Chairman Mao's instruction to us regarding the "leaning to one side" policy in international affairs has received the most obvious and powerful proof here. From now on, all the Chinese people should more firmly stand in the camp of peace and democracy and fight to the end against all anti-peace and anti-democratic forces.

　　民主建国会发言人发表谈话
    欢迎苏联等国与我建立邦交
    【本市讯】民主建国会发言人顷就苏联等国和我国建立外交关系发表谈话称：在中华人民共和国中央人民政府宣告成立的第二天，我们伟大的友邦苏联即和我们这个人民的政府建立外交关系。保加利亚、罗马尼亚、捷克、波兰等东欧新民主主义国家也即相继和我们的政府建立外交关系。这实在不能不令我们感觉无上的光荣和异常的兴奋。这是证明：只有社会主义的苏联才有理想和能力领导全世界一切进步的和平民主的力量，只有社会主义的苏联和东欧新民主主义的国家才会真正同情并援助我们这个属于人民的国家和政府。因为他们自己的国家和政府也是属于人民的。毛主席指示我们的在国际上“一面倒”的政策在这里已经得到了最明显最有力的证明。从此，全中国人民更应该坚决地站在和平民主的阵营，跟一切反和平民主的力量奋斗到底。
