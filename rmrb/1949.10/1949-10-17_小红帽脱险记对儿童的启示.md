　　Reflections on Little Red Riding Hood's Escape for Children
　　Tie Shui
　　Since Comrade Mei Zhi’s fairy tale poem "Little Red Riding Hood's Escape" was published in the People's Daily garden on September 29th, I have been reading it to children every day. The oldest are fourth-grade students, and some of the words and phrases are relatively unfamiliar to them. However, because the author uses new content and new techniques, instead of simply recounting the story as before, the poem narrates with many fresh and lively sentences, which is very interesting to children. When I read it to them every day, they listened very carefully. I explained what they didn't understand, and finally I told them the whole story again. They really like reading this fairy tale poem.
　　This fairy tale poem, in addition to inspiring children's future reading interests, also makes children aware of the brave struggle of farmers and the need for the leadership of the working class. Those who cannot withstand the enemy's threats and inducements are unreliable. People like the little blacksmith are their loyal fighting partners and can kill enemies like the old mountain demon. They all have a preliminary understanding of the spirit of class friendship and mutual assistance.

　　小红帽脱险记对儿童的启示
    铁水
    梅志同志的童话诗“小红帽脱险记”在九月二十九日的人民日报园地上登载出来，我就开始每天读给儿童们听，他们最高是四年级的学生，在词句上有些比较生疏；但是由于作者用新的内容新的手法，并不象从前平铺直叙的记载，以许多新鲜而活泼的句子叙述，很能引起儿童们的注意。在我每天读的时候，他们都很用心的听，不明白处我再加以解释，最后我又全部给他们讲述了一遍。他们很喜欢读这个童话诗。
    这篇童话诗，除了启发了儿童今后的阅读兴趣外。并且从这里使儿童知道了农民的勇敢斗争，需要工人阶级的领导。而那些经不住敌人的威胁利诱的分子，是靠不住的，象小铁匠那样的人，才是自己的忠实斗争伙伴。才能把象老山妖那样的敌人打死。他们都对阶级友爱互助精神有了初步的认识。
