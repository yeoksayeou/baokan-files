　　I. Why is the plague so terrible? Why do we need epidemic prevention?

    The plague (also known as the Black Death, children's plague) is one of the most severe plagues. Once infected, it is extremely easy to die, and it is extremely easy to spread to others. It spreads from one to ten, and from ten to a hundred. Therefore, when the plague breaks out, it often results in the death of the entire family, or even the entire village. Moreover, once this disease is contracted, death occurs in at most six or seven days, and it is extremely difficult to cure. Therefore, whether the plague has broken out or not, everyone should always be careful with epidemic prevention. Otherwise, like in the second year of the reign of Emperor Xuantong of the Qing Dynasty, when forty to fifty thousand people died, how tragic and terrible would that be! To have a good life after liberation, the first thing is to overthrow the reactionaries, and the second is to prevent the plague.

　　II. How does the plague start? How does it spread so widely?

    The plague is originally a disease of rats and wild rats (including voles and hamsters). When they die from the disease, because their bodies cool down, the fleas on them jump off to find another way to live. Sometimes, these fleas jump onto us humans. These fleas drink the blood of diseased rats, and their mouths and stomachs are full of plague viruses. If it bites us, the virus will also enter our blood, and then we humans will also get the disease. Fleas that bite sick people then jump onto others and bite them, and then those people will also get the disease. Especially there is a kind of small yellow flea on rats, which has an even greater ability to transmit the virus. In almost every place, rats get sick before people get the plague. In June and July two years ago, a large number of dead rats appeared in Nanbanlilu, Shuiquan District, Tuquan County, Liaobei Province. The people were all amazed and said, "Why are the rats dying so quickly this year? It's really inexplicable!" In fact, this meant that the rats were already suffering from the plague. Sure enough, in August, people in Tuquan County began to get the plague.

    Once the plague spreads to humans, it spreads even more easily. Because people are active and often walk around, visit others, and do things, it is easy to carry the virus to other places. In this way, rats transmit to humans, and humans transmit to humans, and the plague slowly spreads widely. However, whether rats transmit to humans or humans transmit to humans, there must be fleas as an intermediate medium to transmit the virus (but pneumonic plague can be transmitted to others without fleas as an intermediate medium).

    Two years ago, Chen Zhige's family of eight, young and old, in Chaoyang Village, Fuyu County, all died of the disease, leaving only Chen Zhige himself. Manager Chen of Tianfengtai in the city was Chen Zhige's brother. He took Chen Zhige to the city. Because of housing difficulties, Chen Zhige was sent to live in Liu Mingyi's courtyard outside the East Gate. Chen Zhige died the day he moved in. This was during the land reform. The people of Dongsanjiazi came to Liu Mingyi's house to seize the fruits of struggle. Soon after, more than forty people from Dongsanjiazi died (because Chen Zhige had already transmitted the virus to Liu Mingyi's clothes and other floating objects), and at the same time, the plague broke out in the city (Chen Zhige brought the virus). Yuan Shengdian, Liu Mingyi's eastern neighbor, had four of his five family members die, and the Geng family in the backyard also died of the disease. Also, because Liu Zhushi, a resident outside the North Gate, had moved from Chaoyang Village not long ago and also died of the disease, the northeastern districts of the North Gate also broke out. The cart boss of Deyangrun in Dongyuanzi died of the disease at home (home in the southeast district) because he hauled corpses, and the southeast district also broke out. In this way, the plague spread quickly from Chaoyang Village to the entire Fuyu County, breaking out on a large scale, with almost a dozen people dying every day.

    Some people in the world do not understand the principle of rat-flea transmission, flea-human transmission, and human-human transmission. When a plague breaks out, they say, "This is the plague god causing trouble, let's quickly find a way to send away the plague god!" As a result, loafers and sorcerers take the opportunity to make a fortune, selling talismans, setting up altars, and so on. A whole set of deceptive tricks come out. In fact, there are no plague gods in the world! As long as we can do a good job in epidemic prevention, listen to the epidemic prevention team and the government, the plague will naturally not break out. If someone says there must be a plague god, then we can only say that rats and fleas are the plague gods. Catching fleas and killing rats is sending away the plague god, is fighting the plague god!

　　III. Symptoms of the Plague

    After being bitten by a flea, after about two to seven days, the body suddenly shivers and has a fever, feels hot to the touch, and the pulse is also particularly erratic and weak. At the same time, bumps appear in the armpits, neck, or groin, which are very painful, and pressing them is even more painful. The patient cannot get up, and sometimes勉强 gets up, but has a headache and dizziness, and walks staggering, as if drunk. Sometimes the patient also talks nonsense, feels nauseous, vomits, has a white coating on the tongue, red eyes, and a special look on his face, as if scared. After one or two days, the bumps quickly swell up, become purulent inside, and sometimes break through and become malignant sores. If there is no improvement after three or four days, they will suddenly die. This kind of plague with bumps is called bubonic plague, accounting for 70-80% of all plague patients.

    There is also a type where, after getting sick, there is fever, headache, confusion, talking nonsense, a particularly weak and erratic pulse, sometimes vomiting and diarrhea, and purple spots on the body, but no bumps appear. Such patients are called septicemic plague, and they die in three to four hours at the fastest, and one or two days at the slowest.

    In addition, there is another type where, after getting sick, the patient coughs up blood, sputum, cannot breathe, wheezes, has chest pain, blue hands and feet, fever, talks nonsense, and the pulse beats particularly erratically. This disease is called pneumonic plague, and death is also quite rapid, at most three to five days. Moreover, this type of plague can be transmitted to others without fleas as an intermediate medium. The saliva, sputum, and blood that the patient coughs up, after drying, fly up together with dust, and if others inhale it, they will get the disease. Therefore, this type of plague is the most dangerous and the easiest to transmit.

　　IV. What methods can be used to prevent the plague?

　　1. Kill Rats:

    As mentioned above, rats and fleas are the root cause of the plague. If we can eradicate these two bad roots, we can guarantee that the plague will not break out. Therefore, catching rats and killing fleas is the first step in epidemic prevention.

    There are many ways to catch rats: rat cages, rat traps, rat poison, raising cats, etc. However, to catch rats, it is best to kill the fleas on the rats at the same time, especially in places where the plague has already broken out. In order to kill the fleas on the rats, it is necessary to catch live rats. Use rat cages, or use a bucket filled with water, and then sprinkle a layer of buckwheat husks on the water. When the rats want to eat the buckwheat husks, they will fall into the bucket. After catching live rats or dead rats, move the rats with a long stick (more than three feet long), and never touch them with your hands, or let the children play with them. Immediately scald or burn the rats to death with boiling water or fire. This way, not only the rats, but also the fleas on the rats will be killed.

    Two years ago, Fan Yangshi of No. 6, 7th Street, Qian'an County, Liaobei Province, discovered dead rats at home five or six days before getting the plague. The neighbors advised her to burn them, but her father-in-law did not believe it and picked them up with his hands and took them outside. Three or four days later, the father-in-law got the disease. Then it was transmitted to her mother-in-law, and her mother-in-law transmitted it to her. Of the four family members, three got sick and two died. If they had not picked them up with their hands, but had used a stick to clamp them outside and burned them, then the fleas on the rats would not have jumped onto them, and the family would not have died so tragically!

    Meng Zhaoda of Qianxinglongquan Village, Tuquan County, found that the grain store smelled bad, so he started emptying the granary and found four or five dead rats. Meng Zhaoda picked up the dead rats with his hands and took them out. A few days later, all six members of his family got sick and died one after another. At the same time, the cat of old Liu's family next door was eating a dead rat on the kang. The mother and daughter of the Liu family saw many fleas on the rat jumping onto the kang. The mother and daughter went to catch the fleas with their hands. A few days later, all five members of the family died. Meng Guanglin, a resident of Xiaomeng Village, went to work in the field and saw a dead rat. He kicked it with his foot. After returning home, a bump grew in his groin and he died. A child in Jiajia Street saw a dead rat behind the cabinet and took it out to show the whole family. Four days later, three people in the family died.

    Sun Jianheng, a resident of Dongyuanzi, Fuyu County, personally saw six children playing with dead rats. Later, these six children got sick on the same day and died one after another.

    From the above facts, we can see how terrible fleas and rats are!

    Therefore, in order not to have the plague, killing rats and catching fleas are really two major tasks. However, when killing rats, whether dead or alive, never touch them with your hands. Be sure to move them with a long stick, and then scald them with water or burn them with fire.

    A child surnamed Ma in Jiajia Wopeng, Qingyang District, Tao'an County, got the plague because he cut off the rat's tail. So when we cut off the rat's tail to report the achievement, be sure to burn the rat first, then cut it off.

    Raising cats is a good way to kill rats, but in places where the plague has already broken out, never use cats to kill rats, because after the cat eats the rat, the fleas on the rat will all jump onto the cat, and the cat will become a disease-transmitting object.

    Two years ago, An'guang Cultural Village did a good job in blocking traffic. Many people died in the villages of An'guang City, but no one in Cultural Village got the plague. In October, when the epidemic had subsided, the Geng family of seven in the village suddenly got sick one after another. Everyone was very surprised and did not know where their illness came from. Later, after the epidemic prevention team actively investigated, they found that a cat that they usually liked was staggering when walking. An examination of the cat revealed many small yellow fleas. Only then did they realize that their illness was transmitted by the cat. Later, the cat was burned to death, and the entire Geng family was sent to the isolation center. Geng's house was also thoroughly disinfected. The village has not suffered from infection since then.

    Blocking rat holes (first fill them with lime, then block them with stones or bricks) keeps the rats trapped in the holes or prevents them from coming out to move around. Hiding the things that rats can eat well starves them to death. Moving boxes and cabinets away from the walls prevents rats from hiding. These are all methods to kill rats.

    Secondly, dig trenches around the villages, two and a half feet deep and two feet wide, to block wild rats and rats from other villages from entering the village. Last year, the Tao'an epidemic prevention team dug trenches around their residence on the first day, and the next day they found two diseased rats dead inside. If the trenches were not dug, it would have been too dangerous for the diseased rats to break in!

    Finally, there is one more best way. If you have sulfur, seal the doors and windows tightly, and fumigate the house with sulfur. This will kill not only the rats, but also the fleas, bedbugs, and lice in the house.

　　2. Catch Fleas, Prevent Fleas:

    Tying up the cuffs and trouser legs, and applying lard to the exposed parts of the body such as the hands and neck can prevent fleas from biting. Fleas like to live in dark, damp, and dirty places. To prevent fleas, we must clean diligently, often scorch the ground with dry grass, and sprinkle hot lime. This way, fleas can be killed without spending money. Also, sweeping the floor, spreading the kang, and filling straw mattresses with artemisia argyi from the wild can also reduce fleas.

　　3. Pay Attention to Hygiene, Don't Be Superstitious:

    Many old folks who haven't opened their minds think that various plagues are an unavoidable disaster, and believe in fate, gods, and Buddhas, saying things like "fate is predetermined," "those who shouldn't die won't die, and those who should die can't live," and "if the King of Hell calls you to die at midnight, you can't live until half past midnight." In fact, these are all nonsense. In the past, didn't the old folks believe in "wealth is in heaven, and enlightened people know their fate"? But now, aren't they establishing themselves with the help of the Communist Party and the democratic government!?

    What are the benefits of paying attention to hygiene? Diligent cleaning and washing and drying make it less likely to breed fleas and attract rats, so naturally it is less likely to get sick. For example, No. 8, 4th Street, Dongshun District, Tongliao is the dirtiest place. After the plague broke out, they didn't know to clean, and as a result, 98 of the 250 people in the entire street died, and four families were wiped out. This proves how harmful it is to be dirty and not pay attention to hygiene!

　　4. Get Preventive Injections

    Getting preventive injections is the same principle as getting vaccinated against smallpox. After vaccination, you get a mild case of smallpox (a few smallpox appear on the arm). Getting preventive injections is also like having a very mild case of the plague first. After having this mild case of the plague, it is less likely to get the real plague again. After vaccination, you can be 100% sure that you won't get smallpox. Getting preventive injections can also guarantee 60-70% that you won't get the plague. If you unfortunately get sick, it will be relatively mild, easy to treat, and easy to recover. So getting preventive injections is much safer than not getting them.

    Two years ago, the cadres in Chengzi Well Village, Qian'an County, Liaobei Province, all got injections, and they were in contact with patients every day, but none of them got sick. Some people in Weizi Well Village who were unwilling to get injections all got sick and died. There was another village where, when the epidemic prevention personnel went to give injections, the men all went to work in the fields, and the women all got injections at home. In this epidemic, none of the women died, and many of the men died.

    The example of Baokang Street in Liaobei Province makes it even easier to see the effectiveness of the injections: a total of seventeen cases of the plague occurred in the street, all of whom had not received injections.

    From these facts, it is sufficient to prove that getting injections is very effective. Folks, get preventive injections quickly to save your lives!

    Many loafers and sorcerers, in order to deceive people and make a fortune, often spread rumors to scare the people, saying things like: "Preventive injections are sterility injections, you won't have a good outcome if you get them!" We must never be fooled, which would harm ourselves and others.

　　5. Report Illnesses Quickly, Go to Isolation Hospitals Quickly:

    Why should you go to the hospital when you are sick? Because hospitals are here to treat patients. You can only get well if you go to the hospital. Secondly, it is also to keep patients in a fixed place to prevent them from wandering around and spreading the disease to others. So going to the hospital when you are sick is not only for yourself, but also for others. Think about it: would the democratic government harm the people by doing things for them?

    Going to the isolation hospital means not only having doctors to treat you well, but also having people to take care of everything, including eating, drinking, taking medicine, urinating, and defecating. It is much more convenient than recuperating at home. Some foolish people, when they get sick, secretly invite sorcerers, burn incense, and pray to gods at home. You should know that praying to gods and worshiping Buddhas is all in vain, and it not only delays the illness, but also easily spreads it to others, which is harmful to yourself and others.

    Last year, Tian Guozhong, a resident of No. 17, Zhentou Wobao, Tongliao, Liaobei Province, got bubonic plague. His wife was anxious and quickly told the epidemic prevention team and asked them to treat him. Later, Tian Guozhong had his bumps cut open in the hospital, and his illness slowly improved. The whole family was also very peaceful and was not infected by him.

    Fan Yangshi's father-in-law from No. 6, 7th Street, Qian'an County, got the plague and did not go to the hospital for treatment. He secretly burned incense and worshiped Buddha, praying for God's blessing. As a result, she and her mother-in-law were both infected by her father-in-law. Later, they were discovered by the epidemic prevention team and sent to the hospital for treatment. Fan Yangshi was cured because she was discovered early. The father-in-law and mother-in-law died because they were discovered late and could not be cured.

    Many patients in various places who have been cured in hospitals give plaques, pigs, and sheep to the hospitals to express their gratitude for saving their lives. For example, Liu Fengshan and seven others from Fuyu County collectively gave a pig to the hospital. Patients who are discharged from the hospital often praise the isolation hospital, saying, "It is indeed a democratic government! It is really the benefactor of us poor people! Staying in the hospital means getting treated for the illness, and they also give us rice, white flour, and pork. It can be seen that the current isolation hospitals are truly places to treat illnesses and save people, and serve the people, unlike the hospitals of the puppet Manchuria, which were so evil and despised human lives!"

　　6. Stand Guard and Block Traffic:

    Why stand guard and block traffic? It is to prevent sick people from wandering around, spreading the disease to others, and causing it to break out on a large scale. Last year, Gongrentun Village, in the central district of Tongliao County, Liaobei Province, was in a location that was extremely easy to contract the plague, as its east and south sides were all cemeteries, and it was also the only way to bury the dead. However, only one patient occurred in the village, and no more occurred afterward. The reason is that they saw many people burying the dead every day, knew that the plague was terrible, so early on, under the leadership of the squad leader Chen Shize, production committee members Liu Yunting, Qin Xinghua and others, they strictly implemented standing guard and blocking traffic. Therefore, other villages had entire families wiped out, but Gongrentun Village did not break out.

    When standing guard, never let people come in and out casually because of personal relationships. You must know that if you show favoritism, the plague will not show favoritism. In Wenhua Village, Anguang County, Liaobei Province, 150 militiamen were mobilized to set up six sentry posts, with double shifts day and night, and everyone was determined to keep Wenhua Village from ever being affected by the plague. Day and night, they absolutely prohibited people from other villages from wandering around. The younger brother and mother of the seventh group leader ran a restaurant in Lixian Village. The brother got sick and died, and the mother wanted to come back. When she walked to the sentry post, the group leader said to his mother: "You old woman must think that your son is temporarily unfilial, don't harm everyone, go back." Wenhua Village resolutely blocked the traffic, regardless of relatives. People in other villages said: "The most unaccommodating is Wenhua Village, they don't recognize their neighbors." The militiamen of Wenhua Village said: "Even if you are our own father, we can't let you pass." Because the blockade was good, the plague never broke out in the village.

    In San Shutang Village, Qingyang District, Tao'an County, although the surrounding villages, such as Xianggualama and Sima Jia, had severe outbreaks of the plague, because the cadres of the village were not superstitious, listened to the epidemic prevention team, and mobilized the children's corps and women's association to stand guard and isolate the blockade, which was done very thoroughly, so no one ever got sick.

　　7. Kill Cats and Dogs, Pen Up Livestock Such as Cattle, Sheep, Pigs, Horses, and Chickens:

    In places where the plague has already broken out, cats and dogs must be resolutely killed, and livestock such as cattle, sheep, pigs, horses, and chickens must be penned up, because these animals, especially cats and dogs, bring the virus around very easily. Cats eat rats, and dogs like to dig up graves and eat corpses. In order to save human lives, we must kill all cats and dogs. Cattle, horses, sheep, mules, donkeys, pigs, etc. must be penned up and tied up properly to prevent them from wandering around.

    Zhao Peifang, the daughter of Zhao Qiegao of No. 4, 9th Street, Qian'an County, Liaobei, loved cats. The cat ate rats, brought fleas, and they jumped on her, infecting her with the disease. Fortunately, Zhao Peifang quickly reported to the epidemic prevention team, and after being treated by the epidemic prevention team, her illness improved.

    In Tuquan County, Liaobei Province, because dogs were not killed, the dogs dug up graves and ate corpses in groups, carrying the virus around, which had a very bad effect on epidemic prevention.

　　8. Bury the Dead Well:

    People who die from the plague, whether adults or children, should be cremated. If they cannot be cremated, they should be disinfected by the epidemic prevention team and then buried well, at least eight feet deep underground. Soil must be added at least once a year. Otherwise, wild dogs and wolves will easily dig them up, allowing the virus of the corpses to run out and harm people again.

    Trenches (two feet wide and four feet deep) must be dug around the cemetery to prevent rats from entering and leaving the cemetery and bringing out the virus.

　　V. Prevent Special Agents Every Day, Prevent Epidemics at All Times

    Folks! We have now been liberated and become masters. But once the plague breaks out, we can't take care of anything, we can't work, we can't support the front lines, and our lives are in danger at all times.

    The plague is really an enemy of ours. If we don't resolutely eliminate it, it will take our lives!

    Folks, be sure to remember, prevent special agents every day, prevent epidemics at all times! We must, under the guidance of the government and epidemic prevention workers, eliminate our enemies, eliminate our root of disaster, eliminate the plague that kills without a knife!

　　鼠疫及其预防法
    纪树立
    （本文是东北行政委员会卫生部编印的大众卫生小丛书之一，内容均系根据东北的防疫材料，兹特转载，以飨读者。）
   　一　鼠疫为啥那样可怕？我们为啥要防疫？
    鼠疫（又叫黑死病，孩子瘟）是最厉害的一种瘟疫，得上以后，极容易死，又极容易传给别人，一传十，十传百的，所以一闹起鼠疫来，就时常全家死光，甚至全屯（村）死光；并且这个病一得上，顶多不过六七天就死，又极不容易治。所以无论鼠疫闹起来或还没闹起来，大伙都应当时时刻刻好好小心防疫，不然，象前清宣统二年那样，死了四五万人，那该多么惨！多么可怕！要想好好过翻身日子，第一得打倒反动派，第二就得防住鼠疫。
    二　鼠疫是怎得的？怎闹大发的？
    鼠疫本来是耗子和野耗子（豆触子瞎眯触子也算野耗子）的病，它们得病死了，因为尸首一凉，身上的跳蚤就跳开来，另找生活之路。有的时候，这些跳蚤就跳到我们人身上来了。这些跳蚤喝了病耗子的血，嘴里，胃里，满是鼠疫的病毒。它若咬我们人，那病毒也就借劲儿串到我们人的血里，于是我们人也就得了病。咬了病人的跳蚤再跳到别人身上，咬了别的人，别人也就得病。尤其耗子身上有一种黄色小跳蚤，传毒的力量更大。差不多的地方，在人闹鼠疫之前，都是耗子先闹。前年六七月间，辽北省突泉县，水泉区南半里路，发生大批死耗子。老百姓见了个个称奇，都说“为啥今年的耗子出来幌幌就死啦？真有点莫明其妙！”其实这就是耗子们已经闹鼠疫了，果然到了八月，突泉县的人就开始闹鼠疫了。
    鼠疫一传到人身上，那就更容易传开了。因为人是好活动的，常常要东走，西走，串门子，办事情，很容易把病毒带到别的地方去。这样，耗子传人，人传人，慢慢的鼠疫就闹大发了。不过，无论耗子传人，或人传人，一定得有跳蚤当中作媒介物，才能把病毒传过来（但是肺鼠疫不用跳蚤作中间媒介物，也能传给别人）。
    前年扶余县朝阳屯（村）住户陈致阁一家老少八口都得病死了，就剩陈致阁自己。城内天丰泰陈经理是陈致阁的哥哥，他把陈致阁接到城里。因为房子困难，就将陈致阁送到东门外刘明义院里住。陈致阁搬来后，当天就死去。这正当土地改革的时候。东三家子的老百姓来刘明义家拉斗争果实。以后不久东三家子老百姓就死了四十多（因为刘明义的衣服等浮物已经叫陈致阁给传上病毒了），同时城内也跟着闹了起来（陈致阁把病毒带来了）。刘明义的东邻元升店一家五口死四口，后院姓耿的也得病死了。又因为北门外住户刘朱氏，由朝阳屯（村）搬来不多日子也得病死去，于是北门东北各区也闹起来了。东元子德昌润的大车老板子因为拉死尸，也得病回家（家在东南区）死了，东南区也接着闹了起来。就这样鼠疫由朝阳屯（村）很快的传到扶余全县，闹的很大发，每天差不多要死十几个人。
    世界上有些人，不懂鼠传跳蚤，跳蚤传人，人传人的道理，一闹瘟疫就说“这是瘟神作怪呀，赶快想法子送瘟神吧！”这么一来，二流子，跳大神的，就乘机发起洋财，卖符、摆法坛等等一大套骗人的把戏都来了。其实世界上那有什么瘟神？只要我们能好好防疫，听防疫队和政府的话，瘟疫自然闹不起来，如果有人说一定有瘟神，那只好说耗子和跳蚤是瘟神。我们捉跳蚤，捕耗子，就是送瘟神，就是斗争瘟神爷！
    三　鼠疫的病状
    被跳蚤咬过后，大概两天到七天的样子，身上忽然打冷战发烧，摸着烫手，脉也特别发慌，而且细小；同时在胳肢窝、脖子上，或大腿根起疙疸，疼的很厉害，用手按更痛；病人不能起来，有时勉强起来，可是头痛头晕，走道打幌，就象喝醉了似的；有的时候病人还说胡话，恶心，吐，舌头上有白苔，眼睛发红，脸上的神气也特别，好象害怕似的。这样过了一两天，疙疸很快的肿起来，里面化了脓，有时出头破了成为恶疮。再过三四天如果不见轻快，就会突然死去。象这样起疙疸的鼠疫叫腺鼠疫，占得鼠疫病人总数的七——八成。
    还有一种，得病后发烧头痛，迷糊，说胡话，脉特别细小发慌，有时吐、泻，身上起紫点子，可是不起疙疸。象这样的病人叫鼠疫败血症，得上快则三四个钟头，慢则一两天就会死的。
    另外还有一种，得上病以后，大口吐血，吐痰，上不来气，喘，胸脯子疼，手脚发青，发烧，说胡话，脉跳的特别慌。这样的病叫肺鼠疫，死的也挺快，顶多三五天。而且这种鼠疫，不用跳蚤当中间媒介物就能传给别人。病人吐的唾沫，痰，血，干了以后和灰尘一齐飞起来，别人再吸进去，就会得病。所以说，这一种鼠疫最危险，最容易传染。
    四　用啥办法来防鼠疫？
    一　捕耗子：
    上面已经说过，耗子和跳蚤是闹鼠疫的总根。如果我们能把耗子，跳蚤这两个坏根挖净，保险鼠疫闹不起来。所以我们捉耗子，拿跳蚤是防疫的第一步。
    捉耗子的办法很多：耗笼子，耗铗子，耗子药，养猫等等。可是捉耗子，最好要把耗子身上的跳蚤一块弄死，尤其在鼠疫已经闹起来的地方更应当这样作。为的弄死耗子身上的跳蚤所以要捉活耗子。用耗笼子，或是用一个桶盛上水，水上再撒一层荞麦皮，耗子要吃荞麦皮，就掉在水桶里去了。捉着活耗子或死耗子以后，要用长棍子（三尺以上）挪动耗子，千万不能用手拿，或是叫小孩子们玩弄，要马上用开水或用火把耗子烫死烧死。这样不但耗子，就连耗子身上的跳蚤也都被弄死了。
    前年辽北省乾安县七街六牌范杨氏，在得鼠疫病前五六天，家里发现死耗子，邻居劝她用火烧了，她底老公公不信，用手拿到门外，三四天以后老公公就得上病了。接着又传给她婆婆，她婆婆又传给她，一家四口病了三口，死了两口。如果当初不用手拿，而用棍子夹到外面，用火烧掉，那么耗子身上的跳蚤就不能跳到身上，一家人也不能死的那么惨！
    突泉县前兴隆泉屯（村）孟兆大发觉粮仓里臭气难闻，就开始倒囤，结果发现四五匹死耗子。孟兆大就用手把死耗子拿出去，几天以后全家六口先后得病死去。同时孟兆大的隔壁老刘家的猫衔着死耗子在炕上吃。刘家母女看见耗子身上很多跳蚤跳到炕上。母女二人就用手去捉跳蚤，几天以后，全家五口也都死尽了。小孟屯（村）住户孟广林到地里去干活，看见一匹死耗子，用脚踢了一踢，回家以后，大腿根长疙疸就死了。贾家街一个小孩从柜后看见一匹死耗子，就拿出来给全家人看，四天后全家就死去了三个人。
    扶余县东元子住户孙简衡，亲眼看见六个孩子玩死耗子，后来这六个孩子同日得病，相继死去。
    由以上这些事实来看，跳蚤和耗子是多么可怕的东西！
    因此我们为了不闹鼠疫，打耗子、拿跳蚤，真是两件大事。不过拿耗子的时候，无论死耗子活耗子，千万不能靠近用手拿。一定要用长棍子挪动，然后用水烫，或用火烧。
    洮安县青山区贾家窝棚姓马的小孩因为剪耗子尾巴，也得上了鼠疫。所以咱们要剪耗子尾巴报功的时候，千万先用火把耗子烧一遍，再剪。
    养活猫是拿耗子的一个好办法，但是在已经发生鼠疫的地方，万不可用猫拿耗子，因为猫吃完耗子以后，耗子身上的跳蚤，便都跳到猫的身上去，猫就变成传病的东西。
    前年安广文化村，封锁交通工作做的好，安广城区各村死亡多人，但文化村谁也没得鼠疫，在十月里疫情已下降时，该村耿某一家七口忽然先后得病，大家都很奇怪，不知道他们的病是由哪儿传来的，后来经防疫队积极追究，才发现他们平常所喜爱的一只猫，走路打幌，检查猫的身上，发现有很多黄色小跳蚤，这才知道，他们的病是由猫传来的，以后将猫烧死，耿某全家送隔离所，耿某的房子也行严密消毒，该村以后就再没有遭受传染的了。
    堵耗子洞（先用小灰灌上，再用石头或砖头堵住）使耗子闷在洞中，或不能出来活动；把耗子能吃的东西好好藏起来，让耗子饿死；把箱子，柜子，离开墙，使耗子不能躲藏；这都是捕灭耗子的办法。
    其次要在屯（村）子周围挖太平沟，深二尺半，宽二尺，能够挡住野耗子和别屯（村）子的耗子进屯（村）子，去年洮安防疫队第一天在住处周围挖好了太平沟，第二天就发现两匹病耗子死在里头，如果不挖太平沟，病耗子闯进来，那可太危险了！
    最后，还有一个最好的办法，要是有硫磺的话，把门窗堵严，在屋子里点硫磺熏，这样不但耗子，连屋子里的跳蚤，臭虫，虱子也都熏死了。
    二　捉跳蚤，防跳蚤：
    扎上袖口裤脚，再把手、脖子等露肉的地方抹上猪油，就能防备跳蚤来咬，跳蚤喜欢住在阴湿肮脏的地方。我们要防跳蚤，必须勤打扫，时常用干草燎地，撒热小灰。这样不用化钱就能把跳蚤弄死。再有用野地的艾蒿扫地，铺炕，装草褥子，也能少招跳蚤。
    三　要讲卫生，不要迷信：
    有许多没开脑筋的老乡，以为各种瘟疫是无法挽救的灾难，信天命，信神佛，说什么“命由天定”“不该死的死不了，该死的活不了”“阎王叫你三更死，不能活到三更半”。其实这都是瞎说。过去老乡们不都相信“富贵在天，达人知命”吗？可是现在不是靠着共产党、民主政府，已经安家立业了吗！？
    讲卫生有啥好处呢？勤打扫，勤洗晒，就不容易生跳蚤，招耗子，自然就不容易得病了。譬如通辽东顺区四街八牌是最肮脏的地方，闹鼠疫以后也不知道打扫，结果全牌二百五十人就死了九十八人，死绝户的有四家。这件事是可以证明肮脏不讲卫生是多么有害了！
    四　打预防药针
    打预防药针和种痘就不出天花是一个道理。种了痘，就是出一次小天花（胳膊出了几个痘）。打了预防药针，也是先让人闹一场很轻的小鼠疫。得完了这场小鼠疫，就不大容易再闹真正的鼠疫了。种痘以后，能保十成不出天花，打预防药针也能保六七成不闹鼠疫。假使不幸得病，也比较轻，容易治，容易好。所以说打了预防针，比不打是安全多了。
    前年辽北省乾安县称字井（村）的干部都打了针，天天和病人接近，也都没得病。为字井（村）一些不愿打药针的人，都得病死了。还有一个井（村）子，在防疫员去打药针的时候，男人都下地干活去了，女人在家都打了针。在这次闹瘟疫中，女人都没有死，男人死了很多。
    辽北省保康街的例子，更是容易看出药针的效验：该街共发生鼠疫十七名，都是没打过药针的。
    由这些事实，足可以证明打药针是很有效的。老乡们，为了保命赶快打预防药针吧！
    有很多二流子，跳大神的，为的欺骗人，发洋财，常常造谣吓唬老百姓，说什么：“预防针是断子绝孙针，打上没个好！”我们千万不要上当，误了自己，也误了别人。
    五　有病赶快报，赶快上隔离医院：
    为啥有病要上医院呢？因为医院一来为的给病人治病；只有到病院，病才容易治好；二来也为的把病人放在一定的地方，省得乱串，把病传给别人。所以说有病上医院不但为自己，也是为别人。大伙想想：民主政府为老百姓办事，还能害老百姓吗？
    到隔离医院去，不但有医生给好好治病，连吃饭喝水，吃药，大小便，一切一切都有人照顾。比在自己家里养病，真是方便多了。有些愚人，得上病，偷偷在家里跳大神，烧香，求神。要知道求神拜佛都是白搭，结果不但耽误了病，而且也容易传给别人，真是害己又损人了。
    去年辽北省通辽闹鼠疫，枕头窝堡十七牌住户田国忠得了腺鼠疫。他的老婆着了急，忙告诉防疫队，求他们诊治。后来田国忠在医院里割了疙疸，病就慢慢的好了，全家也都很太平，没被他传上。
    乾安县七街六牌范杨氏的老公公得了鼠疫病，不上医院去治，秘密的烧香拜佛，求神保佑，结果她和她婆婆都被她公公传上了。后来经防疫队发觉送到医院去治。范杨氏因为发觉的早，治好了。公公和婆婆因为发觉的晚，治不好就死了。
    各地有很多在医院里治好的病人，给医院送匾、送猪、送羊，来感激医院救命之恩。比方扶余县的刘凤山等七人，集体给医院送了一口猪。常听出院的病人夸奖隔离病院，说：“到底是民主政府哇！真是咱们穷人的恩人！住医院给治病还不算，还给吃大米，白面和猪肉。可见现在的隔离医院，真是治病救人，为人民服务的地方，绝不象伪满的病院，那么邪虎！那么轻视人命呀！”
    六　站岗放哨，封锁交通：
    为啥要站岗放哨，封锁交通？就是为的防备有病的人乱串，传给别人，闹大发了。去年辽北省通辽县中心区工人屯（村），按它的位置来说，本是极容易传上鼠疫的屯（村）子，因它的东、南两面全是坟圈子，同时又是葬埋人必经之路。但该屯（村）只发生一名病人，以后就不发生了。原因是他们每天亲眼看见过许多埋死人的，知道鼠疫可怕，所以很早就在班长陈世泽，生产委员刘云亭、秦兴华等领导下，最严密的实行了放哨站岗，封锁交通。所以别的屯（村）子都有全家死绝户的，唯独工人屯（村）没闹起来。
    站岗放哨的时候，万不可以因为人情面子，随便让人出来进去。要知道你讲面子，鼠疫病可不讲面子。辽北省安广县文化村，动员了自卫队员一百五十名，设岗哨六处，昼夜双岗，个个下决心保持文化村永不受鼠疫灾难的侵害，昼夜不休，绝对禁止外村人乱串。第七组长的弟弟和母亲在礼贤村开饭馆子。兄弟得病死了，妈妈要回来，走到岗哨旁边，该组长对他妈说：“你老算你儿子暂时不孝，不要害了大伙，还是回去吧。”文化村坚决封锁，不顾亲人。外村人都说：“最不开面的是文化村，不认四邻。”文化村自卫队员说：“你就是咱的亲爹，也不能让你过去。”因为封锁的好，所以鼠疫在该村始终也没有闹。
    洮安县青山区三属堂屯（村），虽然四周的屯（村）子，如香瓜喇嘛，四马架等屯（村），闹鼠疫都挺厉害，但因该村的干部，不迷信，听防疫队的话，发动儿童团，妇女会，站岗放哨，隔离封锁，作的非常彻底，所以始终也没有得病的人。
    七　打死猫、狗、圈起牛、羊、猪、马、鸡等牲口：
    在已经发生鼠疫的地方，要坚决打死猫、狗，圈起牛、羊、猪、马、鸡等，因为这些畜类，尤其是猫、狗，猫吃耗子，狗好扒坟吃死尸，最容易把病毒带来带去。咱们为了保住人的性命，一定要把猫、狗全部打死。牛马羊骡驴猪等要好好的圈起来，拴起来，不叫它们乱窜。
    辽北乾安县九街四牌赵切糕的女儿赵佩芳，她喜爱猫。猫吃耗子，带来了跳蚤，跳在她的身上，传染成病。幸而后来赵佩芳很快的报告了防疫队，经防疫队治疗后，她的病才好了。
    辽北省突泉县，因为没把狗打死，狗就成群结队的扒坟吃死尸，带着病毒，到处乱窜，对于防疫，起了很大的坏作用。
    八　死人要好好埋上：
    得鼠疫而死的人，无论大人，小孩，都应用火烧毁。如果不能烧毁，也要先经防疫队消毒然后好好的埋上，至少要埋八尺深的地下。每年至少要添一次土。不然的话，野狗，野狼容易扒开，使死尸的病毒再跑出来害人。
    坟地的周围，一定要挖太平沟（宽二尺深四尺），防备耗子进出坟地把病毒带出来。
    五　天天防特，时时防疫
    老乡们！咱们现在已经翻身成了主人。可是一旦闹起鼠疫来，什么事也都不能顾及了，不能干活，不能支援前线，而且时时刻有刻都生命的危险。
    鼠疫真是我们一个仇人。我们不坚决消灭它，它就要把我们的命夺去！
    老乡们千万记住，天天防特，时时防疫！咱们一定要在政府和防疫工作人员指导下，消灭咱们的仇人，消灭咱们的祸根子，消灭杀人不用刀的鼠疫！！
