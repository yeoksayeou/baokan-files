　　Utter Failure Leads to More Trouble!
　　American Diplomatic Spies in Europe Conspire to Exploit Tito for New Plots
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 26th: London dispatch: Following meetings in Paris on the 21st and 22nd, American diplomatic personnel stationed in Europe began another meeting in London on the 24th. Those who attended the Paris meeting included the US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Kirk; the Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Douglas; the Ambassador to France, Bruce; the Ambassador to Italy, Dunn; the Marshall Plan Ambassador-at-Large, Harriman; the US High Commissioner for West Germany, McCloy; the Director of the European Division of the State Department, Perkins; and State Department advisor Bohlen. The current London meeting is being chaired by Perkins, and attended by the American Ambassadors and Ministers to the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia. The US Ambassadors to the UK and France, and the High Commissioner for West Germany are also present. American officials are maintaining strict secrecy regarding the content of the meetings. The convening of the London meeting was not even notified to the British Foreign Office in advance. However, the American eagerness to strengthen espionage activities against the Soviet Union and the Eastern European People's Democracies is difficult to conceal. Perkins declared on the 23rd that American diplomatic personnel would conduct extensive discussions on the situation in Eastern Europe.

According to sources deemed reliable by the Telepress Agency, prior to the meeting of American diplomatic personnel in Europe, the heads of American espionage had held a series of meetings in Washington under the chairmanship of Perkins. Participants included Donovan, the head of the wartime Office of Strategic Services (OSS); Dulles, an activist and policy planner for large corporations; Allen Dulles, the head of the wartime OSS in Europe; Chamberlain, the director of the General Staff's Second Bureau (Intelligence Bureau); Kennan, the anti-Soviet "theoretician"; and a representative of Archbishop Spellman, who has ties to the Vatican. The nature of the Washington preparatory meeting indicates that the purpose of the London meeting is mainly because American espionage and various propaganda activities within the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies have completely failed. The US State Department and intelligence agencies have had to admit this fact, and are therefore eager to exchange views in order to formulate new strategies.

According to informed sources speaking to the Telepress Agency, the heads in Washington currently favor three plans, which may be used simultaneously. The Washington meeting has, in effect, decided to establish a so-called "National Communist International" centered in Belgrade, with Tito as the senior commander and Pijade as the theoretician. They believe it is necessary to provide the world camp of Trotskyites, splitters, right-wing Social Democrats, and other imperialist agents using Marxist vocabulary with a geographical, ideological, and leadership core. Here, it is said that the Americans listened to the British. The British firmly believe that Tito's usefulness to the imperialist cause will run parallel to, and not contradict, Tito's retained socialist mask. Therefore, Tito will remain "revolutionary" and Belgrade will be the center of his "National Communist International." Many traitors and scoundrels now living in London, Washington, and Paris will be asked to pack their bags and go to Belgrade after the London meeting. According to the same source, the second plan (which is actually part of the first plan) is for experts in Belgrade to run sabotage schools and train spies to be sent into the People's Democracies to carry out activities. Exiles from Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, and other countries will be sent to Belgrade for training and then sent to work in various places. Perkins, Donovan, and Chamberlain support this plan. The third plan advocates secretly strengthening the West German defense forces and helping Western European local forces and police suppress the "insiders" (i.e., the working class). This is the main reason why McCloy attended the intelligence meeting. McCloy felt that "the socialist countries (i.e., the People's Democracies, excluding Yugoslavia) are finished," and that putting more money into these countries would no longer produce significant results.

    美驻欧外交特务人员密谈妄图利用铁托进行新阴谋
    【新华社北京二十六日电】伦敦讯：美国驻欧的外交人员继二十一、二十二两日在巴黎举行会议之后，二十四日又在伦敦开始举行会议。参加巴黎会议的有美驻苏大使寇克、驻英大使道格拉斯、驻法大使布鲁斯、驻意大使邓恩、马歇尔计划无任所大使哈里曼、驻西德高级专员麦克洛埃、国务院欧洲司司长柏金斯、国务院顾问波伦。目前进行中的伦敦会议由柏金斯主持，参加的有美国驻苏、捷、波、罗、匈、保，以及驻南的大使和公使。美驻英、驻法大使和驻西德高级专员均出席。美国官方对于会议内容，极守秘密。伦敦会议的召开，事先甚至没有通知英国外交部。但美国急于加强反苏反东欧人民民主国家的特务活动的意图，是很难隐蔽的。柏金斯二十三日宣称：美国外交人员将对东欧情势作广泛探讨。
    据电通社引可靠方面的消息称：在美驻欧外交人员会议之前，美国特务人员的首脑曾于华盛顿在柏金斯主持之下举行了一连串的会议。参加者有战时战略服务处处长邓努万、大企业的活动家和政策的策划人杜勒斯、战时战略服务处驻欧首脑阿兰·杜勒斯、参谋本部二局（谍报局）局长张伯伦、反苏“理论”家凯南，以及与梵蒂冈有联系的斯贝尔蔓大主教的代表等。华盛顿预备会议的性质，说明了伦敦会议的目的，主要是由于美国在苏联和人民民主国家内的间谍活动以及各种宣传活动，在拉伊克叛国案被揭露以后，已完全失败，美国务院及特务机关不得不承认这一事实，因此急于交换意见，以便制定新策略。
    据消息灵通人士向电通社透露：华盛顿的首脑们，目下赞成三个计划，可能同时使用。华盛顿会议实际上已决定成立以贝尔格莱德为中心，以铁托为高级指挥，以彼亚德为理论家的所谓“民族共产国际”。他们认为必须给托洛茨基分子、分裂分子、右翼社会党人及其他利用马克思主义辞汇的帝国主义代理人的世界阵营以地理上的、思想上的及领导上的核心。在这里，据说美国人倾听了英国的意见。英国坚信，铁托对帝国主义事业的用处，将与铁托的保留社会主义面具平行而不悖。因此，铁托将仍然是“革命的”，贝尔格莱德则是他的“民族共产国际”的中心。许多现在住在伦敦、华盛顿及巴黎的叛徒败类，在伦敦会议后，将被请求卷起行囊，前往贝尔格莱德。据同一人士称：第二个计划（实际上是第一个计划的一部分）是由贝尔格莱德的专家开办破坏分子学校，并训练间谍，以便派入人民民主国家进行活动。乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰及其他国家的流亡分子，将被派到贝尔格莱德受训，然后再派往各处工作。柏金斯、邓努万及张伯伦赞成这一计划。第三个计划主张秘密加强西德国防军，帮助西欧地方军与警察镇压“内线”（即工人阶级）。这是麦克洛埃出席谍报会议的主要原因。麦克洛埃感到“社会主义国家（即不包括南斯拉夫在内的人民民主国家）已经完了”，把更多的钱投到这些国家中，是再也得不到重大结果的了。
