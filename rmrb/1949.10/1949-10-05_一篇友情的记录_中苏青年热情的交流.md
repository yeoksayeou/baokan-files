　　A Record of Friendship
    ——The Passionate Exchange Between Chinese and Soviet Youth
    In the auditorium of Moscow University, our performance had just finished. I ran to a corner upstairs, wanting to see the Moscow University students' performance. I had just quietly stood against the corner of the wall when a Soviet youth, around twenty years old, ran up to me and politely asked, "Kitai?" I replied, "Kitai" (Note: China). I didn't think my voice was very loud, but everyone around me cast bright eyes on me. They seemed to be looking for something on me, but not exactly; because their kind eyes had already made it clear to me that they cared about this Chinese youth. A girl of eighteen or nineteen, while saying "Zdrastvuite!" (Note: Greetings), shook my hand. At this time, the Soviet young friends surrounding me all extended their strong and warm hands, asking about my health in concerned tones. In the bright light, the smiles on their faces deeply stimulated my beating heart. At this moment, my heart beat even faster. I felt like I was in a most familiar house, talking with my dearest older brothers and sisters about what had happened since we last met. The conversation was exciting, innocent, and lively; but I didn't understand their language, and they didn't understand mine either, but we only understood one sentence each. I happily shouted, "Long live Stalin!" They clapped their hands and shouted, "Long live Mao Zedong!"
    I was pulled by this group of enthusiastic young people to the first row of the balcony. I was so anxious that I gestured with my hands to indicate that I wouldn't sit, but their attitude was very firm, and they insisted on pressing me into a seat right in the center. As soon as I sat down, a Chinese student was pulled by a girl of seventeen or eighteen and brought to me. Following this, the girl began to ask:
    "Are all the performers who came abroad this time young art experts?"
    I quickly replied: "We are all young literary and art workers. We have all grown up under the guidance of Comrade Mao Zedong's correct literary and art thought." After the translation, the young man who had pulled me earlier immediately stood on the chair and said it loudly again, which caused a burst of warm and surprising applause. After the applause subsided slightly, the young man who had pulled me earlier said to me seriously and enthusiastically:
    "On behalf of these thirty-odd members of the Communist Youth League, I salute the Chinese youth! You defeated Chiang Kai-shek under the leadership of Mao Zedong, which is your great contribution to the freedom and happiness of mankind in the world. Here, the Soviet youth pay their highest respects to the Chinese youth!" I was so excited by this solemn address that my face was covered in sweat, and I couldn't say a word, but I had so many things to say to the Soviet youth in my heart. At this moment, I thought for a moment and said: "Thank you for your concern for the Chinese youth. In the future, China will enter the stage of construction. The Chinese youth must learn from the Soviet youth's experience in building the motherland, and at the same time, your spirit of building the motherland is the spirit of the Chinese youth in building the motherland!" These words caused them to applaud warmly, and more than a dozen young people lifted me up. They shouted, "Hurrah!" and shouted, "Long live Mao Zedong!"
    The chorus on stage began. I wanted to listen carefully to the songs they sang, but the girl next to me was always chattering about things. After a while, she took out a book from her bag, and then she wrote a lot of words on the book. Then the person next to her also wrote, one after another, writing on the cover of the book. I didn't understand what they were doing. This book was passed from the front row to the back row, and more than a dozen young people scrambled to write on the book. Finally, the book was passed back to the girl who was originally sitting next to me. The cover of the book was already filled with words I didn't understand. The chorus on stage had just stopped when the girl immediately handed the book to me and said, "This is a copy of the Soviet Communist Youth League Charter, given to Chinese friends as an exchange of feelings between Chinese and Soviet youth!" At the same time, the translator told me that it was written on the book:
    Chinese and Soviet youth join hands,
    Work hard to consolidate the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people!
    Then he told me that there were thirty-four Youth League members signed below. I was really moved by this enthusiasm. I didn't know how to answer them, so I just kept saying, "Thank you! Thank you!" But this couldn't express my gratitude to the Soviet youth. Suddenly I remembered something, and I anxiously took off a badge with Chairman Mao's image with a trembling hand and handed it to the girl next to me, saying: "This is a badge with Mao Zedong's image, given to the Soviet youth as a souvenir." They were probably particularly satisfied, and the sound of "Hurrah!" immediately shook the entire upstairs.
    I had just sat down when a dance was starting on stage. A note was passed to me, with the words "To a Chinese comrade" written on the back. I opened it and saw it said: "I am learning Chinese, but I know very little. Please write something for me." At this time, the Chinese student told me that it was asking me to sign. I immediately wrote on a piece of paper: "Soviet youth are an example for Chinese youth!" Then I asked the person next to me to pass it over. In less than a minute, a copy of "Mao Zedong on People's Democratic Dictatorship" (Russian version) was passed to me, with the words written on it: "Chinese youth, you are living in a very special era. Everything must be for the independence of the motherland and the peace of the world!
    Long live your leader Mao Zedong!
    Long live the unity of Chinese and Soviet youth!"
    I immediately stood up from my seat and raised my right hand to the left, indicating that I would never forget this enthusiasm. At the same time, a young man also stood up opposite me and waved his hat at me. I was about to speak when suddenly a burst of applause cut off my words.
    The program ended. This group of enthusiastic young people tightly shook my hand: "Do Svidaniya!" "Do Svidaniya!" Some patted me on the shoulder, and some hugged me in their tall arms and kissed me. When everyone had left, the young man who had pulled me earlier handed me a photo of Moscow, with the following written on the back:
    Moscow Anti-Fascist Committee transferred
    Moscow
    Polzhnov received it
    You write to me
    I gratefully assured him, "Friend, I will definitely write to you!" Then I wrote my mailing address in his notebook. At this time, he jumped up. He pointed to my heart, then pointed to his heart, and then held his hands tightly together. I understood that he meant that the two of us were friends. When I nodded to show that I understood, he hugged me and kissed me and wouldn't let go. He said: "Chinese youth are our most concerned friends. When you return to your country, please convey our condolences to the youth who are fighting!" I gratefully said: "I will definitely tell them about the enthusiasm of the Soviet youth for the Chinese youth, so that the friendship between Chinese and Soviet youth will be more consolidated!"
    Finally, Polzhnov sent me to the hotel. I didn't want to leave him, and he didn't want to leave me either. There seemed to be tears in his eyes, and my tears had already flowed down my face!
    September 1949, in Moscow

　　一篇友情的记录
    ——中苏青年热情的交流
    在莫斯科大学礼堂里，我们的节目刚刚演完，我跑到楼上一个角落里，想看看莫斯科大学生的戏。我静静的刚贴着墙角站住，这时一位二十岁上下的苏联青年，跑到我跟前客气的问：“刻打衣？”我回答说：“刻打衣”（注：中国）。我觉得我的声音并不大，可是我周围的人们，都把明亮的眼光投到我身上，他们好象在我身上寻找什么东西似的，但又不是；因为他们和蔼的眼光已经使我明白他们在关心着这位中国青年。一位十八九的姑娘一边说着：“刀斯以打宁！”（注：问好的意思）一边和我握着手；这时围着我的苏联青年朋友们，都伸出他们健壮而温暖的手，用关切的口吻问着我的健康。在明亮的灯光下，他们脸上的笑容，深深的刺激到我跳动的心，这时我的心更加跳动了，我象在一间最熟习的房子里，和我最亲爱的哥哥姐姐们在谈别后的事情。谈话是兴奋而天真的，活泼的；可是我不懂他们的话，他们也一样不懂我的话，但是彼此只懂的一句话，我高兴的喊着：“万岁，斯大林！”他们一边鼓着掌，一边喊着：“万岁，毛泽东！”
    我被这群热情的青年拉到楼座第一排，急的我用手比划表示不坐，但他们的态度很坚决，硬把我按在正中心的一个座位上。我刚刚坐下，这时一位中国留学生，被一位十七八岁的姑娘拉着走到我跟前，随着这位姑娘就开始问了：
    “你们这次出国的表演者，都是青年艺术专家吗？”
    我赶忙回答：“我们都是青年文艺工作者，我们都是在毛泽东同志正确文艺思想指导下生长起来的。”翻译说完，紧接着刚才拉我的那位青年，站在椅子上又大声的说一遍，这时引起一阵热烈而惊奇的掌声。掌声稍微平静，方才拉我的这位青年严肃而热情的向我说：
    “我代表我们这三十多位共产主义青年团员，向中国青年致敬！你们在毛泽东领导下打败了蒋介石，这是你们对世界人类自由幸福的大贡献，这里苏联青年向中国青年致崇高的敬礼！”被这庄严的致词激动的我，脸上一股劲流汗，一句话也说不出，可是肚子里又有好多话要向苏联青年说。这时我稍想一下说：“谢谢你们对中国青年的关心，今后中国将走上建设阶段，中国青年一定向苏联青年学习你们建设祖国的经验，同时你们建设祖国的精神，就是中国青年建设祖国的精神！”这话引起他们热烈的鼓掌，十几个青年把我抬起，他们喊着：“乌拉！”又高喊着：“万岁，毛泽东！”
    台上的合唱开始了。我想好好听听他们唱的歌，可是我旁边那位姑娘总是喳喳的在商量事情，一会他从皮包里取出一本书，然后他又在书上写上不少字，接着他旁边的人也写，一个接着一个的在书皮上写字，我不明白他们在作什么，这本书从前排传到后排，十几个青年争着往书上写字，最后又把书传到原来坐在我旁边的那位姑娘手里，书的皮上已经写满了我不懂的文字。台上的合唱刚刚停止，这位姑娘立时把书递给我手说：“这是一本苏联共产主义青年团章，送给中国朋友作为中苏青年感情的交换！”同时翻译又告诉我书上是这样写的：
    中苏青年携起手来，
    为巩固中苏人民友谊而努力！
    接着他又告诉我，下边有三十四位共青团员签名。我真被这热情所感动了，我不知怎样回答他们才好，只连声说：“谢谢！谢谢！”可是这又不能表达出我对苏联青年的感激，忽然我想起来了，我急的用颤抖的手，取下一个毛主席像的胸章，递给我身旁那位姑娘说：“这是毛泽东像的胸章，送给苏联青年作纪念。”可能他们特别满意，“乌拉！”的声音立时震动了整个楼上。
    我刚刚坐下，台上正在开始一个舞蹈，一个条子递到我跟前，背面写着：“给一个中国同志”。我打开一看，上面写着：“我学中国话，但是我知道很少，请您写给我什么？”这时那位中国留学生告诉我是叫我签字。我马上在一块纸上写上：“苏联青年是中国青年的榜样！”然后请旁边的人给传过去。过了不到一分钟，一本“毛主席论人民民主专政”（俄文版）又递到我跟前，上边写着：“中国青年，你们生活在非常时代中，一切要为祖国的独立和世界和平而斗争！
    祝你们领袖毛泽东万岁！
    中苏青年团结万岁！”
    我马上从座上站起，向左边举起右手，表示我对这热情永远不能忘记，同时我对面也站起一位青年，向我摇着帽子。我刚要说话，忽然一阵掌声把话给割断了。
    节目完了。这群热情的青年，紧紧的握我的手：“刀拉斯吉！”“刀拉斯吉！”有的用手拍我的肩膀，有的把我抱到他高大的怀里吻一下。当人们都走完了，方才拉我的那位青年，递给我一张莫斯科照片，后面写着：
    莫斯科反法西斯委员会转
    莫斯科
    波尔主诺夫　　　　　收
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　你给我来信
    我感激的向他保证说：“朋友，我一定给你来信！”然后我又在他本上写上我的通信地址，这时他跳起来了，他用手指着我的心，又用手指着他的心，然后两手紧紧一握，我明白他的意思是：两个人是朋友。当我点头表示我明白的时候，他抱住我吻着不放，他说：“中国青年是我们最关心的朋友，你回国替我们向在斗争中的青年致以慰问！”我感激的说：“我一定把苏联青年对中国青年的热情告诉给他们，使中苏青年的友谊更巩固起来！”
    最后波尔主诺夫把我送到旅馆，我不愿离开他，他也不愿离开我，他眼里象流出水珠，而我的泪已经流到脸上了！
    一九四九，九月，于莫斯科
