    The Story of Crossing the River

    While chasing the fleeing defeated enemy south, Zhao, the director of our corps' staff office, and I were riding our horses side by side on the Shengcun Highway, talking about the Jiuhua Mountains across from us and the arduous struggle of the underground guerrillas behind enemy lines. He suddenly asked me what time it was, as he wanted to check his watch. I said, "Six twenty."

    He seemed to savor this ordinary reply, and sighed deeply, saying:

    "Ah! Six twenty has been quite an education for me!"

    I was very curious about this nonsensical remark, so I pressed him for details. He told me about an incident during the crossing of the Yangtze River:

    Before the corps' direct units crossed the river, Political Commissar Xie called him in and asked him to prepare the boats, as the corps headquarters would cross to the south bank at six twenty. He accepted this order, thinking that since the corps headquarters was crossing the river at six o'clock, it wouldn't be hard to find a few boats. It wasn't a big deal. As for the difference between six twenty and six thirty, it wasn't that significant, as long as it was around that time. So he picked up the phone and told the responsible cadre of a certain army to prepare the boats for the corps headquarters at six twenty, and he readily agreed. At four o'clock, he personally went to the riverbank to ask about the preparations. At that time, boats were shuttling back and forth between the north and south banks, transporting rear troops and supplies. He looked at his watch, and like him, he didn't have a sense of time, thinking that as long as the boats returned around six o'clock, it would be fine. So he decided to let the boats specifically reserved for the corps direct units make another trip. Of course, he agreed, but the clock kept ticking, and it was almost six twenty, but the boats hadn't returned. He had a feeling that something was wrong, so he cobbled together a few small boats, but there were no boats to carry horses. Just as it was six twenty, Political Commissar Xie appeared in front of him. Political Commissar Xie asked him how the preparations were going, and he pointed to the boats and said:

    "All—prepared, people can go first!"

    Political Commissar Xie looked at the boats and immediately noticed that there were no boats to carry horses, so he asked him:

    "Then what about the livestock?"

    He said, "The livestock will wait for the boats carrying horses from the other side to come over before crossing."

    Political Commissar Xie said, "Then aren't we still waiting on the south bank! Why didn't you prepare properly?"

    He had to explain the situation, saying that the boats hadn't returned on time because of the wind.

    Political Commissar Xie, who was usually amiable, modest, and humble, suddenly became very stern, questioning him:

    "Can't we handle things accurately even once? Why don't you consider the wind direction when you are a responsible cadre of a high-level command organization?"

    He broke out in a sweat and said that it was a certain comrade who advocated letting the boats go to the other side. Political Commissar Xie then called that comrade over and inquired about the truth, asking him the same question:

    "Can't we handle things accurately even once?" He also explained a lot about the need for accurate and unified action in highly concentrated operations of the army, and that all past guerrilla habits were detrimental to our regularization today and to carrying out today's combat missions, and so on.

    That comrade could only sincerely admit his mistake and humbly accept Political Commissar Xie's criticism. He immediately borrowed a boat for carrying horses from a neighboring unit and invited Political Commissar Xie to cross the river. Political Commissar Xie asked strangely:

    "Didn't you say that the boats carrying horses hadn't returned yet! How come you have one now?"

    People told him how they had borrowed a boat, and he said sternly:

    "No, this haphazard method is also wrong. Aren't we disrupting other people's plans again? Return it to them quickly, we'll wait a little longer."

    "Six twenty," Director Zhao said after recounting the story, "This time I learned a lesson. I must admit that I didn't attach enough importance to being punctual in my mind. I can't remember whether I emphasized the time issue in the phone call or when meeting with that comrade. Scolding him was scolding me. I have six twenty o'clock stuck in my head all day long."

　　六点二十分
    卢耀武
    渡江故事
    在向南穷追逃窜的败敌中，我和我们兵团参谋处赵处长在省屯公路上骑着马并辔而行，谈说着我们对面的九华山和地下游击队在敌后艰苦奋斗的情形，他忽然问我现在几点钟，他准备对一下表。我说：“六点二十分”
    他对这样一句平凡的答话象回味什么一样，长叹了一声说：
    “唉！六点二十分可对我的教育真不小！”
    我很奇怪他这句没头没脑的话，便追问起来，他谈起渡江的一件事情来：
    兵团直属队渡江前，谢政委把他叫到跟前，叫他准备好船只，六点二十分兵团指挥部要过到江南岸去，他接受了这个命令，自己觉得反正是六点多兵团指挥部要过江，他认为兵团首长要过江，哪里还找不到几只船？这不算什么了不起的事情，到于六点二十分和六点三十分之间是没有很大差别的，只要在那个时间就算了，于是他拿起电话机，告诉某军的负责干部，叫他六点二十分钟为兵团指挥部准备好船只，他满口答应了。在四点钟的时候，他亲自跑到江边去问他准备的情形，那时船正在南北两岸穿梭似地运输后方部队和辎重。他看了看表，也和他一样，没有准备的时间观念，认为反正六点多钟船能回来就行，于是就决定把专门留给兵直的船再放过一趟再说，他当然同意了，但是时针不断地旋转，眼看快到六点二十分了，船还没有回来，他预感着有些不对头，于是他七凑八凑，凑了几只小船，却没有载马的船，可是刚六点二十分谢政委在他面前出现了，谢政委问他准备的怎么样，他指一指那一批船儿说：
    “都——准备好了，人先过去吧！”
    谢政委看了看那些船，马上发现没有载马的船，就问他：
    “那末牲口怎么办呢？”
    他说：“牲口等那边载马的船过来再渡。”
    谢政委说：“那我们不还是在南岸等待吗！为什么你们不准备好呢？”
    他只得说明了情况，并说因为风的关系船没按时回来。
    平时和颜悦色，谦逊虚心的谢政委突然变得十分严厉，责问他：
    “难道我们就不能准确地办一回事情吗？当个高级指挥机关的负责干部为什么不计算风向的问题？”
    他出了一身汗，就说是某同志主张放船到对岸的，谢政委便叫某同志来，追问事实的真象，用同样的一句话问他：
    “难道我们就不能准确地办一回事情吗”？并解说了许多关于大军高度集中作战，正规战中需要准确和统一的动作，一切过去的游击习气都是对于我们今天的正规化，和我们执行今天战斗任务有害的，等等。
    某同志只有诚恳地承认自己的错误，虚心地接受谢政委的指责，回头他赶紧从友邻部队借来一支载马的船，请谢政委过江，谢政委奇怪的问：
    “不是说载马的船还未回来吗！怎么说上一顿又有了呢？”
    人们告诉了他怎样地借来一只船，他严肃地说：
    “不行，这个乱抓的办法也是不对的，这样我们不又打乱别人的计划吗？赶紧还人家去，我们等一等好了。”
    “六点二十分”，赵处长说完故事的经过，又说：“这次我算接受了一次教训，我必需承认，在我脑海里是没有足够重视要遵守时间的，我记不清楚到底在电话中，在和某同志见面时究竟我强调了时间问题没有，训他正是在训我，我成天价脑子里装着六点二十分。”
