"To Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China in Beijing:

On the occasion of the election of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, please accept our warm and militant greetings on behalf of the Bulgarian workers and staff. The Bulgarian workers and staff have been following with great concern the great and victorious struggle of the heroic Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party against the Anglo-American imperialists for many years. The establishment of the People's Republic of China and the complete crushing of the Kuomintang traitors by the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army is a new and strong pillar in the peace and democracy camp headed by the great Soviet Union and the leader of progressive mankind, Comrade Stalin. Therefore, the anti-imperialist camp has become an even more powerful camp against the instigators of new wars.

Long live the People's Republic of China!
Long live Comrade Mao Zedong, the leader of the heroic Chinese people!
Long live Comrade Stalin, the leader and teacher of the people of all countries!

The Central Committee of the Bulgarian Trade Unions
