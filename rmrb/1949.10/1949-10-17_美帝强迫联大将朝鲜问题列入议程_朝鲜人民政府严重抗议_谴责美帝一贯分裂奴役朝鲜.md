Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 16th -- Park Heon-young, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, on behalf of the Korean People's Government, lodged a serious protest against the United Nations General Assembly's illegal inclusion of the Korean question on the agenda under the coercion of the United States, and the decision passed by the Special Political Committee to continue to maintain and strengthen the "United Nations Commission on Korea." The protest has been telegraphed to UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie and the President of the Fourth UN General Assembly, Romulo, respectively. The protest pointed out that the defeat of Japanese imperialism created the possibility for the Korean people to establish their own independent country. However, due to the U.S. government's sabotage of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers' Conference's correct decision to help Korea quickly become a democratic and independent country, Korea, which has been liberated for four years, is still divided into North and South, following two completely different paths.

The protest stated: For four years, North Korea has eliminated the evils of long-term Japanese rule and implemented various democratic reforms to improve the material and cultural life of the people, thereby laying a solid foundation for building Korea into a unified, democratic, and independent country. However, the situation in South Korea is the opposite. Agriculture and industry have collapsed, and the people's political freedoms have been completely deprived. The South Korean reactionary government uses terror and brutal massacres to treat people who yearn for freedom. This is evidenced by the fact that in the four years since liberation, as many as 478,000 patriots in South Korea have been exposed, 154,000 have been imprisoned, and 93,000 have been murdered. The responsibility for this situation in South Korea should be entirely borne by the U.S. imperialists and their running dogs, the Syngman Rhee reactionary clique.

The protest then enumerated the facts of the U.S. government's forceful passage of the establishment of the "United Nations Commission on Korea" in the Second and Third United Nations General Assemblies in order to implement the policy of dividing and enslaving Korea. It stated: The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea believes that the only correct way to resolve the Korean question at the present stage is for any UN agency not to interfere in Korea's internal affairs, in order to implement the Fatherland Unification Democratic Front's program for peaceful unification. The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea believes that including the Korean question on the agenda of the Fourth Session of the United Nations General Assembly and discussing the Korean question without the participation of the true representatives of the Korean people - the representatives of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea - is illegal and violates the UN Charter and the interests and aspirations of the Korean people. The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea opposes the decision of the Special Political Committee of the Fourth Session of the General Assembly and lodges a serious protest.

The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea fully supports the Soviet delegation's proposal to quickly dissolve the "United Nations Commission on Korea" and give the Korean people the possibility of establishing a unified and democratic country.

The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea reiterates that any decisions on the Korean question passed by the United Nations General Assembly without the participation of the true representatives of the Korean people are null and void. If the United Nations General Assembly continues to recognize only the interests of the traitors and reactionary cliques of the Korean people and disregards the will and aspirations of the Korean people, the Korean people will not stop fighting. They will do everything possible to force the "United Nations Commission on Korea" to withdraw from Korea immediately, and will continue to fight with their own strength for the unification, democracy, and independence of their fatherland.

　　美帝强迫联大将朝鲜问题列入议程
  　朝鲜人民政府严重抗议
    谴责美帝一贯分裂奴役朝鲜
    【新华社平壤十六日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外交部长朴宪永，代表朝鲜人民政府，对联合国大会在美国强迫下非法将朝鲜问题列入大会议程并经由特别政治委员会通过继续保存与加强“联合国朝鲜委员会”的决定，提出严重抗议。抗议书已分别电达联合国秘书长莱氏和联合国第四届大会主席罗慕洛。抗议书指出：日本帝国主义的溃败，给朝鲜人民造成建立自己独立国家的可能性。但由于美国政府破坏了莫斯科三外长会议关于帮助朝鲜迅速成为民主独立国家的正确决定，致使解放了四年之久的朝鲜，至今依然分裂为南北两部而走着两条完全不同的道路。
    抗议书说：四年来，北朝鲜肃清了日本长期统治的恶果，实施了提高人民物质文化生活的各种民主改革，从而奠定了将朝鲜建设成为统一民主独立国家的坚强基础。但南朝鲜的情况，则与此相反，农业和工业均已破产，人民的政治自由完全被剥夺，南朝鲜反动政府以恐怖统治和残暴屠杀来对待渴望自由的人民。这从解放后四年来南朝鲜的爱国者被检举的已达四十七万八千余人、被监禁的达十五万四千余人、被虐杀的达九万三千余人的事实中，足以得到证明。造成南朝鲜这种情形的责任，应该完全由美帝国主义者及其走狗李承晚反动集团来负。
    抗议书继即历数美国政府在第二届与第三届联合国大会中，强行通过设立“联合国朝鲜委员会”，以便执行分裂与奴役朝鲜政策的事实。并称：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府认为：在现阶段解决朝鲜问题唯一正确的方法，是联合国的任何机构不干涉朝鲜内政，以便实施祖国统一民主主义战线关于和平统一的纲领。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府认为：将朝鲜问题列入联合国大会第四届会议的议程，并在仍然没有朝鲜人民的真正代表——朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府代表的参加下讨论朝鲜问题，是非法的，是违背联合国宪章和朝鲜人民的利益与愿望的。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府反对联大第四届会议特别政治委员会的决定，并提出严重的抗议。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府完全支持苏联代表团关于迅速解散“联合国朝鲜委员会”，予朝鲜人民以建立统一民主国家的可能的提议。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府再次声明：举凡联合国大会在没有朝鲜人民的真正代表参加下而通过的关于朝鲜问题的任何决定，一概无效。假如联合国大会在今后仍只承认朝鲜人民的叛逆和反动集团的利益，而蔑视朝鲜人民的意志和愿望时，朝鲜人民就不会停止斗争。他们将尽一切可能，迫使“联合国朝鲜委员会”即时撤出朝鲜，并将以自己的力量，为祖国的统一民主独立而继续斗争。
