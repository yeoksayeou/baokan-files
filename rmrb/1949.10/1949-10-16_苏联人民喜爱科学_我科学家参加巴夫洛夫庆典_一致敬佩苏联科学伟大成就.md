Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 15th: TASS Moscow, 11th: The delegation of scientists from the People's Republic of China, invited by the Soviet Academy of Sciences to participate in the centennial celebration of the great Russian scientist Pavlov, paid close attention to the state of Soviet scientific research, as well as the principles of Soviet public health and higher education.

In the past few days, before returning to their country, the Chinese scientists visited scientific research institutions and medical institutions in Leningrad. At the Pavlov Institute of Physiology, they spoke with Dr. Tonkikh, who introduced the guests to new achievements in Soviet physiology. The guests were particularly interested in the work being carried out in "the capital of conditioned reflexes" (as people call the science town of Koltushi, founded by Pavlov).

Academician Orbeli received the Chinese scientists in Koltushi and told them about the work of the laboratory, the research methods of conditioned reflexes in various animals, and the influence of the environment on the formation of the basic characteristics of biological organisms. The Chinese scientists also visited the clinical diagnosis of neuropathies.

At the Institute of Physiology of the Central Nervous System of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, they examined in detail the work of Soviet scientists, the development of Pavlov's theories, and the methods of applying these theories in medicine. Professor Pan Shu (member of the delegation, Director of the Psychology Department of Nanjing University) said in a conversation with Soviet scientists that he was deeply impressed by the degree of development of Soviet science, and said: Only in a socialist country, under a truly democratic system, is science truly valued. Only when the power is in the hands of the working people can science develop, reach its peak, and truly serve the people.

Professor Ji Zhongpu, President of Harbin Medical University, described to Soviet scientists the widespread application of Pavlov's theories in the treatment of various diseases in China, as well as the significant impact of Pavlov's theories on the development of world physiology.

Feng Depei, a famous physiologist and Director of the Institute of Medicine of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, paid particular attention to the application of scientific achievements in the Soviet public health system, and hoped to use these experiences to develop China's public health. Feng Depei said: As we are about to return home, the scientists of the People's Republic of China are filled with deep admiration for everything we have seen in the Soviet land. We will tell the Chinese scientific community how the Soviet government supports and values science, and how the Soviet people love science. The experience of Soviet scientific research, higher education, and public health organization will make it much easier for the intellectuals of the People's Republic of China to complete the new tasks they face. We firmly believe that with these experiences, scientists can work more effectively and further promote science for the service of the people.

### 苏联人民喜爱科学  我科学家参加巴夫洛夫庆典　一致敬佩苏联科学伟大成就

　　苏联人民喜爱科学
    我科学家参加巴夫洛夫庆典
  　一致敬佩苏联科学伟大成就
    【新华社北京十五日电】塔斯社莫斯科十一日讯：应苏联科学院之邀，到苏参加伟大的俄罗斯科学家巴夫洛夫百年诞辰庆典的中华人民共和国科学家一行，对苏联科学研究的情况，以及苏联公共卫生与高等教育的原则，非常注意。
    过去几天中，在他们回国之前，中国科学家访问了列宁格勒科学研究机关和医药机关。在命名巴夫洛夫的生理学研究所里，他们曾与生物科学博士吨基赫夫人谈话，她给来宾们介绍苏联生理学上新的成就。来宾们对在“条件反射的首都”（人们都这样称呼巴夫洛夫所创建的科学小城科尔图希）所进行的工作特别感到兴趣。
    科学院院士奥尔贝里在科尔图希招待中国科学家，对他们讲述试验室的工作、各种动物的条件反射的研究方法，和环境对生物有机体基本特性的构成的影响。中国科学家也参观了神经病的临床诊断。
    在苏联科学院所属中枢神经系统生理学研究所里，他们详细考察了苏联科学家的工作，巴夫洛夫学说的发展和在医学上应用这些学说的方法。潘菽教授（代表团团员，南京大学心理系主任）与苏联科学家谈话时谈到他对苏联科学发展程度的深刻印象，并说：只有在社会主义国度里，在真正民主的制度下，科学才真正被重视。只有政权被掌握在劳动人民群众的手中时，科学才能够发展，才能够登峰造极，才能够真正为人民服务。
    哈尔滨医科大学校长季钟璞教授向苏联科学家叙述中国治疗各种疾病上广泛应用巴夫洛夫学说的情形，以及巴夫洛夫学说对世界生理学之发展的重大影响。
    中国中央研究院医学研究所所长著名生理学家冯德培，特别注意苏联公共卫生制度中科学成就的应用，并希望运用这些经验以发展中国的公共卫生。冯德培说：在这行将回国的时候，我们中华人民共和国的科学家，对于我们在苏维埃国土上所看见的每一事物，莫不充满深深的敬佩。我们将告诉中国科学界，苏联政府是如何支持与注重科学，苏联人民是如何喜爱科学。苏联科学研究工作和高等教育及公共卫生组织上的经验，将使得中华人民共和国知识分子完成面临的新任务，比较容易得多。我们深信，有了这些经验，科学家可以更加成效丰硕地工作，并将更促进为人民服务的科学。
