　　North China Grain Company Sets Annual Targets
  　Grain Management Combined with Cotton and Native Produce Procurement
    [North China News] The North China Grain Company convened a meeting of branch managers on September 3rd to set targets for the coming year. The meeting agreed that grain management must be closely integrated with the procurement of cotton, native produce, and other items. Efforts should be made to strengthen regulation, support economic crop areas, control grain prices, and maintain a reasonable grain-cotton price ratio (one jin of ginned cotton equals eight to ten jin of millet). This is to ensure the smooth completion of cotton and native produce procurement targets. In accordance with the laws of natural circulation, reasonable regional price differences should be maintained. A large supply of coarse grains should be provided to disaster areas in exchange for fine grains, and the grain needs of state-owned factories, government agencies, and schools should be guaranteed through supply stores. Grain supplies for ordinary citizens will be regulated through the market. Furthermore, a policy of unity will be adopted towards private merchants, organizing and guiding them in procurement and regulation. Those speculators and profiteers who disrupt the market will be resolutely cracked down on to stabilize grain prices and the market. The meeting clearly pointed out that state-owned trade is not solely for profit but to support production. It was unanimously agreed that future management work must be standardized, transportation and storage must be strengthened, and various systems must be strictly defined. Special emphasis was placed on the principle that future grain work should prioritize transportation, followed by processing, distribution, and procurement. The meeting also decided that the North China Grain Company would be located in Tianjin, with twelve branch companies in Suiyuan, Zhangjiakou, Tangshan, Taiyuan, Handan, Shijiazhuang, Baoding, Xinxiang, Shanxian, Hengshui, Linqing, and Beijing, as well as thirty-nine sub-companies in Tangda, Cangxian, Wuyuan, Baotou, and other areas.
