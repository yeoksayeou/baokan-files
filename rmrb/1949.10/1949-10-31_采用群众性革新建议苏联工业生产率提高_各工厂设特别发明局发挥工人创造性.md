　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 30th: TASS reports: The Soviet Union's industrial labor productivity in the third quarter of this year increased by 11 percent compared to the same period last year. This achievement is mainly due to the implementation of mass suggestions for improving the labor process put forward by tens of thousands of Stakhanovite workers, foremen, technicians, and designers. To celebrate the 32nd anniversary of the founding of the Soviet state, innovators in various industrial sectors are now summarizing the achievements made in accelerating production, reducing costs, and further mechanizing the labor process.

　　According to materials from the Central Committee of the Soviet Automobile and Tractor Industry Workers' Union, a total of 11,500 people put forward 32,500 suggestions this year to improve technology and accelerate the production process. Almost half of these suggestions were adopted by factories, helping to save approximately 100 million rubles. Forty percent of the suggestions were put forward by workers, and the rest were put forward by foremen, technicians, engineers, and heads of various work departments. Each of them enjoys the right of invention and receives remuneration based on a certain percentage of the funds saved as a result of the adoption of their suggestions. This year, the remuneration they received has reached several million rubles.

　　Machine tool manufacturing factories are also proud to have many innovators. In the "Red Proletarian" factory in Moscow, one in every ten workers is an innovator. In the first nine months of this year, the factory saved more than 500,000 rubles due to the adoption of their suggestions. Innovators at the Moscow Tire Factory adopted more than 100 suggestions in production (the adoption of these suggestions can save nearly one million rubles annually) as a gift to the October Revolution. In the petroleum industry, thanks to the creative initiative of innovators, more than 80 million rubles were saved this year.

　　The management and trade union organizations in Soviet enterprises have made great efforts to help develop the ideological creativity of industrial workers. Special invention bureaus have been established in various factories. Every innovator can consult with the relevant factory engineers and technicians during the implementation of their suggestions. The rationalization and new invention promotion committee elected from among the workers is subordinate to the trade union organization. These committees are responsible for promoting the adoption of new inventions in industry, opening special training classes, research laboratories, lectures, and establishing technology halls to explain new inventions to improve workers' technical education. Many large Soviet enterprises publish collections of the most interesting new inventions of local innovators.

　　采用群众性革新建议苏联工业生产率提高            
    各工厂设特别发明局发挥工人创造性
    【新华社北京三十日电】塔斯社讯：苏联今年第三季工业中的劳动生产率比去年同期提高了百分之十一。这一成就主要是由于实行了几万斯塔哈诺夫式工人、领班、技师与设计师所提出的改进劳动过程的群众性建议的结果。为了迎接苏维埃国家成立三十二周年纪念，各工业部门中的革新者，现正总结加速生产、减低成本、以及使劳动过程进一步机械化所赢得的成就。
    根据苏联汽车与拖拉机工业工会中央委员会的材料，今年共有一万一千五百人提出了三万二千五百个改善技术与加速生产过程的建议。其中几乎有一半建议被工厂采用，因而帮助节省了约一亿卢布。百分之四十的建议是工人提出的，其余的建议是领班、技师、工程师与各工作部门的负责人提出的。他们当中的每一个人都享有发明权，并按照因采用他们的建议而节省下来的资金的一定的百分数取得报酬，今年，他们获得的报酬，已达好几百万卢布。
    工作母机制造厂也因拥有许多革新者而自豪，在莫斯科“红色无产者”工厂，每十个工人当中就有一个是革新者。在今年九个月中，由于采用了他们的建议，该厂节省了五十余万卢布。莫斯科轮胎工厂的革新者在生产中采用了一百余件建议（采用这些建议每年可节省近一百万卢布），作为献给十月革命的礼物。在石油工业方面，由于革新者的创造性的积极发挥，本年度节省了八千余万卢布。
    苏联各企业中的经理部与工会组织，尽了很大的努力来帮助发展产业职工的思想上的创造性。各工厂都成立了特别发明局。每一个革新者在实施他的建议的过程中，都可以请教有关工厂的工程师与技师。从工人当中选举出来的促进合理化与新发明委员会，是隶属于工会组织的。这些委员会负责促成在工业中采行新发明，开办特别训练班、研究室、讲座，成立讲解新发明的技术厅以提高工人的技术教育。苏联许多大企业都出版关于当地革新者的最有趣味的新发明的文集。
