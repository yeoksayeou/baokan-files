　　The Restoration and Construction of the Northeast Mechanical Industry

Compared with other heavy industries, the Northeast mechanical industry is inferior and its foundation is weak. Before August 15th, the Japanese invaders regarded Northeast China as a market for their own mechanical industry, and did not allow Northeast China to develop its mechanical industry on a large scale in a normal way. After August 15th, the Northeast mechanical industry was severely destroyed. It is estimated that 90% of the machinery and equipment were destroyed by the enemy, puppets, and Chiang Kai-shek bandits. Almost no machines survived from the largest "Sumitomo" and "Mitsubishi" machine factories. In addition, after the Northeast mechanical industry became the property of the people, due to lack of experience, unfamiliarity with the mechanical industrial production process, and inability to manage this diversified industrial product, the task of building the Northeast mechanical industry today is arduous and complicated.

The Northeast mechanical industry developed relatively late, and it was not until three or four years before August 15th that it began to be actively built. At that time, Japanese imperialism was threatened by air raids and moved some of its mechanical industry from Japan to Northeast China to engage in military production. This can be regarded as the most developed period of the puppet Manchukuo mechanical industry. At this time, there were more than 30 first, second, and third-class mechanical factories, and the number of workers increased to 150,000 to 160,000. Even at this time, the Northeast mechanical industry still had great weaknesses: the mechanical factories were extremely scattered and small in scale. Most of them were scattered and attached to various large mines and factories. They did not have an independent system and could not manufacture large machines. They could only meet the needs of the industry at that time for some small machines and some relatively rough machines. These characteristics of the colonial mechanical industry have further increased the difficulties in today's construction.

At present, the Northeast mechanical industry is estimated to have 22,000 machine tools, scattered in various factories and mines. Some of these tools still need to be repaired before they can be put into operation. In addition, there are some privately-operated machine factories, scattered in various provinces and cities, estimated to have 4,000 to 5,000 machines. Apart from these, the more complete units are the No. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 Machine Factories under the Northeast Mechanical Industry Administration, plus 12 units including the grinding wheel, tool, ball bearing, automobile, experimental, and Andong Machine Factories. When they were first taken over, the entire bureau had only 500 complete machines. Through the efforts of all employees, the number of complete machines reached 2,418 by the end of June, and the number of workers also increased from 1,448 at the time of takeover to 11,020. From the current scale, it can produce lathes, machine tools, mining machinery, air compressors, vehicles, water pumps, boilers, and so on.

The task of repairing 1,000 machines throughout the year by various factories of the Mechanical Bureau was fully completed by the end of June, exceeding the target by 231 units. In this work, the workers showed a high degree of initiative. Although there were no drawings and a lack of technicians, the workers still used various methods to overcome difficulties and finally installed the machines. However, most factories failed to complete their manufacturing tasks. This was because some factories that could manufacture machines did not specifically determine their production targets, and therefore fell into a state of planlessness and aimlessness in serving industry and mining. In addition, the machines in each factory were not complete, and everyone was not accustomed to cooperating with each other in production and adjusting machines, resulting in failure to exert production efficiency. Due to lack of experience, some losses were also suffered in production, affecting the repair and production work in the past six months, and failing to quickly enter a normal state.

In view of the above situation, changes have gradually been taking place since May. In order not to deviate from reality and to take care of future development, the primary task of the mechanical industry at present is to serve industry and mining on the existing foundation. To this end, it is necessary to organize the existing mechanical forces and closely integrate with the public and private mechanical industries in Anshan, Fushun, and other places to strive to complete this task. In terms of strengthening our own strength, we will proceed in a planned and step-by-step manner. We plan to establish a machine tool factory to establish our own people's machine manufacturing industry. At the same time, we must train skilled workers and technicians in a planned and organized manner, and gradually restore and build the mechanical industry into an independent industry, moving towards unified management and specialized division of labor, in order to undertake the mission of promoting the development of other industries. This is the long-term vision for the development of the Northeast mechanical industry.

　　恢复与建设中的
  　东北机械工业
    东北机械工业，和其他重工业比较起来，是逊色的，基础是薄弱的。“八一五”前，日寇把东北作为其本国机械工业的市场，不许东北大量的正常的发展机械工业。“八一五”后，东北机械工业又遭到了严重的摧毁，据估计遭敌伪蒋匪破坏的机器设备达九成，最大的“住友”和“三菱”机器厂，几无幸存一台机器。加上东北机械工业归于人民所有之后，由于缺乏经验，不熟悉机械工业生产过程，不善于管理这种多样性生产品的工业，由此今天建设东北机械工业的任务是艰巨而复杂的。
    东北机械工业发展较晚，直至“八一五”前三、四年，才开始积极建设。因为那时日本帝国主义受空袭威胁，从日本将部分机械工业迁来东北，全力从事军工生产，这可算是伪满机械工业最发达的时期。这时共有头、二、三等机械工厂卅余，工人发展到十五、六万人。即使在这时候，东北机械工业仍有很大的弱点：机械工厂极其分散、规模小，绝大部分是分散附设在各个大的矿山、工厂中，没有独立自成一套的系统，不能制作大型机器，只能应付当时工业需用的一部分小型机器，及一些比较粗糙的机器，这些殖民地性质机械工业的特点，也就更增加了今天修建中的困难。
    目前东北机械工业，估计尚有二万二千台工作机器，分散在各个工厂与矿山中，其中有一部分器机尚待修理，始能开动；另外还有一部分私人经营的机器厂，分散在各省、市中，估计有四、五千台机器。除此以外，比较能成一套的则是东北机械工业管理局所属的第一、二、三、四、五、六机器厂，加上砂轮、工具、滚珠、汽车、实验、安东机器厂共十二个单位。刚接收时，全局完整的机器不过五百台，经过全体员工的努力修复，至六月底完整的机器有二四一八台，工人也由接管时的一四四八人，增到一一○二○人。从现在的规模来看，可制作车床、母机、工矿机器、空气压缩机、车辆、水泵、锅炉等等。
    机械局各厂全年修复一千台机器的任务，六月底即全部完成并超过二三一台。在这一工作中，工人发挥了高度的积极性，虽然没有图样，又缺乏技术人员，工人仍然用各种方法，克服困难，终于把机器按装起来了。但在制造任务上大多数工厂都未完成计划，这是由于某些可以制造机器的工厂，没有具体的确定生产对象，因此在为工矿服务这一工作中，陷于无计划无目的状况；又加上各厂机器都不成套，大家不习惯互相配合生产与调整机器，结果不能发挥生产效率；因为缺乏经验，在生产上亦受到一些损失，影响半年来修建与生产工作，未能很快的走入正常状态。
    鉴于以上情况，五月以来，已逐渐在转变，为了不脱离现实而又照顾将来的发展，目前机械工业的首要任务，是在现有基础上为工矿服务，为此必须组织现有机械力量，同时与鞍山、抚顺等地公私营机械工业密切结合，为完成此任务而努力。在壮大自己力量上，则是有计划有步骤的进行，拟建立一个母机工厂，以建立人民自己的机械制造业，同时要有计划有组织的训练技术工人与技术人员，逐步地把机械工业恢复建设起来，成为一种独立自主的工业，走向统一管理，分工专业化，以担负起推动其他各种工业发展的使命，这是东北机械工业发展的远景。
