　　Xinhua News Agency, Guangdong Front, 9th: Simultaneously with the People's Liberation Army launching a powerful offensive on various fronts in Xiang territory, the Northern Guangdong Liberation Army also launched an attack. Qujiang, an important town in Northern Guangdong, was declared liberated on the morning of the 7th. Prior to this, a unit of the People's Liberation Army advancing southward took the strongholds of Zhoutian Market, Daqiao Market, and Dongheba east of the city in Qujiang's northeast on the 6th. Another unit liberated Renhua County, northeast of Qujiang, at the same time. Qujiang, formerly known as Shaozhou, also called Shaoguan, is located on the southern section of the Yuehan Railway, at the upper reaches of the Beijiang River. It controls Guangzhou to the south and Hengyang to the north, serving as the gateway to Northern Guangdong. Since the PLA liberated Jiangxi and Hunan and pressed south toward Guangdong and Guangxi, the enemy has boasted of reorganizing the so-called "Guangdong-Hunan-Jiangxi defense line," increasing bandit troops to Qujiang, attempting to form three major defense focuses with Hengyang and Guangzhou. In late September, bandit troops from the 39th, 63rd, and 97th armies, as well as the main force of the Bai bandits, the 46th Army, were successively transferred here. At the same time, a corps from the bandit 21st Army Group was transferred to the Yingde area to support Qujiang. However, the Hunan Liberation Army bravely attacked, and the Bai bandits responded in panic, transferring the entire bandit 46th Army and the main force of the 97th Army northward. The remaining enemy in the Qujiang area, under the rapid advance of the People's Liberation Army from several directions, had their morale shaken, and they fled south in a panic at the mere sound of the wind. At this point, the remnant bandit troops in Hunan and Guangdong have been cut off by us, and Guangzhou, the bandits' last nest, is also exposed to the People's Liberation Army. The Liberation Army is now bravely advancing south in pursuit.
    
    Xinhua News Agency, Central China Front, 9th: The Central Route People's Liberation Army on the Central China Front liberated Hengyang City, an important town in southern Hunan and the junction of the Yuehan and Xianggui Railways, on the morning of the 8th. Bai Chongxi's bandit army headquarters fled in a panic.

Along the way, more than 20,000 remnants of the Kuomintang bandit army surrendered to the Liberation Army. At this point, the Kuomintang bandit army remaining in Gansu Province has been completely eliminated. Currently, the vanguard of the Liberation Army has reached the border of Xinjiang and is preparing to enter Xinjiang Province.

    【新华社兰州九日电】控制甘肃走廊的人民解放军，继续向西长驱挺进，由九月二十二日至二十八日一周间，连克临泽、高台、酒泉、玉门、安西等五座县城，沿途国民党匪军残部两万余人向解放军投诚。至此，残留在甘肃省境内的国民党匪军已完全被消灭。现解放军前锋已进抵新疆边界，正准备进入新疆省。沿途投诚的西北国民党残部有匪西北军政长官公署黄祖勋部九十一军二三一师、二四六师残部、周嘉彬部一二零军一七三师、二四五师残部，工兵七团、工兵十九团、通讯七团、山炮营、榴弹炮营、高射炮营、宪兵十六团、新疆叶成匪部七十八军一七八师之五三二团、骑兵第九旅，匪甘肃河西警备总司令部之骑兵学校，及匪联勤第八补给区辎汽三团、辎汽五团、辎汽十三团、汽车保养团、骆驼团、伪新疆供应局监护连等残部，共计两万余人。
