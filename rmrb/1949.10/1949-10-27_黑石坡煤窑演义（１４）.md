　　The Black Stone Slope Coal Mine Chronicle (14)

　　Furthermore, Da San was unaccustomed to farming. Planting pumpkins required plowing the land first. Although the earth wasn't as hard as coal, you still had to stand and hunch over to plow, and your back would ache after just a few strokes. It wasn't nearly as smooth as digging coal. His acre of land was also on Devil's Face Slope, so carrying manure and water meant walking over half a kilometer and climbing uphill, which his shoulders couldn't handle. He was always working alone, feeling weak and listless, and he couldn't even remember clearly how to plant pumpkins. It was incredibly frustrating.

　　Fortunately, he encountered a good neighbor, namely Shuan Cheng. Shuan Cheng was only eighteen years old, with handsome features and a quick mind. When he was a child, he ran off to work as a small laborer at the Yangquan station. Although he was among children who cursed and fought, he didn't learn those bad habits. Instead, he learned many small skills and recognized a few characters. When the station laid new tracks, he was faster than anyone else at hammering the stones under the rails. When trading companies needed help loading and unloading goods, he could even help them keep count of the numbers, remembering everything clearly. Therefore, most of the station's recruiters, staff, and merchants knew and liked him. Later, when his father died, he returned to cultivate those six acres of rented hillside land to support his mother and brother. In a year, he had learned almost everything about farming. Every day before dawn, he went to Yangquan to carry manure. Many places gave him manure for free. He would return and stay in the fields all day, tending to the land well. In winter and spring, he would go down the kiln to carry loads or find some other way to earn money. He was very resourceful. However, he wasn't a rogue. He was honest and upright. Sometimes he liked to tell jokes with the adults, but he also knew what to say and what not to say, so everyone in the village said he was a good young man and a good prospect. In the past, Da San hadn't paid much attention to him, but these days, the hillside above Da San's pumpkin patch was cultivated by Shuan Cheng. The two of them sometimes met while working, and they started chatting. Gradually, they became good partners.

　　Originally, Shuan Cheng admired Da San for his ability and straightforwardness. He had liked Da San for a long time, but he was a little timid and hadn't found the right opportunity, so he hadn't interacted with Da San before. These days, as they worked together in the fields, Shuan Cheng noticed that Da San wasn't used to plowing, so he came up with a plan. They swapped tasks, letting Da San plow his hillside land, kneeling down to plow like digging coal, which was much easier. Shuan Cheng, who was used to plowing flat land, plowed for Da San, helped Da San borrow farm tools, gave him some manure when Da San didn't have any, helped him carry water, taught him how to cultivate, or they helped each other out. Da San felt that this young man was a rare good person in the village, so he also liked him very much. The two of them chatted while they worked, really enjoying themselves.

　　One day, as they were planting pumpkins together in the field, one digging holes and the other watering with manure, Da San casually asked Shuan Cheng, "Why are you so good to me?" Shuan Cheng joked, "I'm hoping to drink a cup of your wedding wine!" Da San's face turned red, and he quickly said, "Why are you saying that too?" Shuan Cheng laughed again, "I heard people saying it! Widow Liu even said you were interested in Bai Quan!" Da San became anxious and quickly grabbed Shuan Cheng, explaining the whole story. Shuan Cheng nodded in agreement, saying, "Right! It's better if you don't say anything about it. That Widow Liu talks nonsense. If she messes up something with Bai Quan, who knows what kind of trouble it will cause!" Da San looked at Shuan Cheng and couldn't help sighing. Shuan Cheng quickly said, "Don't talk about that anymore! Uncle Da San, to be honest, you're straightforward and skilled, and you're so good at working in the kiln. I'm planning to learn from you this fall! Is that okay?" Da San said, "Sure! Have you ever been down a kiln?" Shuan Cheng said, "How could I not have been down a kiln? But I was just a carrier, and I can't even dig well." Da San said, "You can learn that. You're still young! Have you ever been out?" Shuan Cheng said, "I haven't been far, just familiar with the station." Da San said, "That's good! People who have traveled and seen the world have a broader perspective and are more interesting. Staying in a small mountain village is really boring." Shuan Cheng said, "Your words aren't accurate! Old Man Ju Bao is always traveling to prefectures and provincial capitals, but what do you say about him?" Da San quickly interrupted, "You're twisting my words! He wasn't originally one of us!" Shuan Cheng said, "People like him probably have their own reasons. Damn it, those people are really enjoying themselves!" Da San said, "Screw them! If they're enjoying themselves, we can't pee on them!" Shuan Cheng also said, "But what about Yu Bao? He's also traveled and seen the world!" Da San thought for a moment and said, "Has he really traveled and seen the world? I can't quite figure him out, but for some reason, I don't like the way he looks. How is he at working in the kiln? I heard he was even a supervisor at Yi Li Tai, but he doesn't seem like it. What about him?" Shuan Cheng had just been speaking casually, but when Da San asked, he suddenly felt uneasy and stopped working, looking at Da San without saying anything. He suddenly remembered something.

　　Da San saw that Shuan Cheng had stopped moving and raised his head to ask him, "What's wrong?" Shuan Cheng sighed, pulled Da San to sit down on the spot, and told Da San honestly about Yu Bao's character. Finally, he said, "Uncle Da San! I can't hide it from you. I'll tell you the truth! Uncle Xi Lu's kiln was originally supposed to have Yu Bao as the supervisor. Later, you took over. I heard rumors that Yu Bao really hates you!" Da San immediately became angry and said, "Xi Lu told me that he was thinking about having Yu Bao do it, but it wasn't settled yet! Did they really agree on it?" Shuan Cheng said, "I don't know if they agreed or not, but before you came back to the village, everyone said he was going to do it, and he himself had already bragged about it!" Da San couldn't control his anger. He couldn't work anymore, so he stood up to leave, saying, "No wonder he's always trying to make things difficult for me! But he doesn't even have the guts to say it to my face. What kind of behavior is that!" Shuan Cheng tried to stop him, but he couldn't. Da San said, "No! You can't stop me! I took the job of a fellow worker. This can't be left unsaid! Sigh… Good for you, Xi Lu!" After saying that, he hurried back to the village.

　　黑石坡煤窑演义（１４）

    再说，大三上地也不惯。栽窝瓜得先刨地，地虽说没有炭那么硬，却一定要立着哈着腰刨，刨两下腰就酸疼，总不如刨炭顺当。他这一亩地又在鬼脸坡，担粪担水要走一里多地，还得爬坡上去，他肩膀也受不住。他每回又是一个人干活，没劲没劲地，并且他连个窝瓜怎么栽种也记不很清，真是烦的不行。
    幸好他碰对了一个好地邻，那就是拴成。拴成才十八岁，长得俊眉俊眼，心眼机灵，他小时候一个人跑到阳泉站上当小工，跟站台上那些开口骂人动手打架的孩孩们一道，他却没学坏，反倒学会了很多小巧手艺，识了几个字，站上铺新轨道，他砸垫道的石头子比谁也快，商号家装货起货，缺人手，他还能帮人家记个数目，记得一清二白，因此上，站上招工的、职员和商号家大多认识他，喜欢他；后来他父亲死了，他就回来养种那六亩租佃的坡地，养活他妈和他兄弟。他一年工夫就把地里营生学得差不多了，每天天不亮他还总去阳泉担粪，好些地方白送他大粪，他回来就一天困在地里，把地作务得挺好，冬春才下下窑挑挑扁担，或找个什么赚钱活，挺有办法；但他这人并不跳皮，又老实又正派，有时也爱跟大人们一道说个耍笑话，但也很懂得长短，不该说的就不说，所以村里人们谁也说他是个好小伙好材料。过去大三没怎么注意他，这会大三那窝瓜地上面的斜坡，就是拴成养种的，他二人有时碰对了一同作活，这才捣拉起来，慢慢地，不觉成了一对好的伙计。
    原来拴成见大三有本领有能耐，为人痛快，不知怎么早就喜爱上了大三，只是他还有些胆小，又没碰对时机，所以一直没跟大三来往过。这些天来，他二人一同上地，拴成看出来了大三刨不惯地，就想了个法，两个换了换，让大三刨他那斜坡地，跪着刨，象刨炭一样，省劲得多，他自己是刨惯了平地的，就替大三刨，还帮大三借农具；大三没有粪，拴成也给他一些，还帮他抬抬水，教他怎么怎么养种，或是两人互相参忙。大三觉着这年轻人真是村里少见的好人，也就挺喜爱他，他两个短不了一边动弹一边捣拉，真个是痛痛快快。
    有一天，他二人在一块地里栽窝瓜，一个刨坑，一个浇粪水，一边动弹一边说话，大三无意地问拴成道：“你这人怎么待我这么强？”拴成耍笑道：“我是想着喝你一杯喜酒嘛！”大三脸一红，忙道：“你怎么也说这哩？”拴成又笑道：“听人们说嘛！柳沟家还说，你对白泉家有意哩！”大三急了，忙拉住拴成，把这事的起根缘由说了一遍，拴成点头称是道：“对！你不说这事也好。柳沟家那人说话没稿子，她给你咯搅着什么白泉家的，还不定闹出什么纠缠不哩！”大三望了拴成两眼，不觉叹息起来；拴成忙道：“甭说这啦！大三叔，说真的，你这人痛快利索，窑底下把式又那么强，秋后我盘算跟你学学哩！这可行吧？”大三道：“行！你下过窑么？”拴成道：“还能没下过窑？只不过是个担头，刨都刨不好。”大三说，“那能学，你还年轻嘛！你出过门么？”拴成说：“没出过远门，只站上混得挺熟。”大三道：“这就行！人只要跑过大地势的，眼界宽，才有点意思；光在个山沟沟小村村呆着的，实在没劲。”拴成说：“你这话也不准！聚宝老人家不是短不了跑州府省城的？你说他那人……”大三忙插嘴道：“你这可说歪啦！他起根就不是咱们这号人嘛！”拴成说：“他那号人许有他那号人的意思。＠他妈的，那人们可就是享福哩！”大三道：“管他那干球！他享福，咱还尿不着他哩！”拴成又道：“可你说玉宝呢？他也是跑过大地势的哩！”大三想了想道：“他也跑过大地势么？我倒还摸不清他的根底，只是我这脾性，看着他就不怎么对眼；他窑底下把式怎么样？听说他还在义立泰当过领事，可他那架势并不象。他怎么？”拴成本是信口说的话，这会大三一问，不觉心眼卜通起来，就停住了手里的营生，望着大三不说话，心中却想起了一件事。
    大三见拴成不动弹了，就抬头问他道：“怎么啦？”拴成叹息了一声，拉着大三在当地坐下，就掏出心眼话，把玉宝的为人给大三学说了一顿，最后说：“大三叔！我不能瞒着你，我实告你吧！喜禄叔这窑，原本是叫玉宝当领事的，后来你干上了，我听风言风语的，玉宝可着实恨你哩！”大三立时火气上冲，忙道：“喜禄当日对我说，只说是想叫玉宝干，可还没说妥嘛！真个他们是说妥了的么？”拴成说：“说妥没说妥的闹不清，可那会你还没回村，人们谁也是说他干的，他自己个也早就吹开啦！”大三怎么也制不住心头的火气，营生也干不下去了，忙站起来就走，一边说：“怪难他跟我总要闹个蹩扭的！可他又不拉下脸明打明说，这算个什么行道！”拴成想拉住他，却怎么也拉不住，他道：“不行！你别拉我！我抢了同行把式的营生，这可不能不说清！唉……好你个喜禄！”说完，就急忙忙回村去了。
