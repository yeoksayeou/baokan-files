Colorful Floats Surge onto the Streets
	Floats from various organizations, groups, factories, and schools spontaneously surged onto the streets, adorned with giant statues of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, huge banners and red cloth, colorful and eye-catching, attracting large crowds of spectators. They sang the national anthem and "The East is Red," beat gongs and drums, and some used loudspeakers to promote the nature and significance of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), the Central People's Government, and the CPPCC's Common Program. They loudly told the audience: "The government of the imperialist lackey Chiang Kai-shek has collapsed, and we will never be bullied by them again. The Chinese people have stood up from now on..." Their speeches constantly aroused cheers and applause from the masses. In the bustling downtown areas of East and West Chang'an Avenue and Qianmen, such floats sometimes gathered in groups of seven or eight, or even twenty. The number of people on the streets exceeded that of any important festival.
	As the moon rose and the electric lights illuminated the city, the results of the Central People's Government election were announced. When the news that Chairman Mao had been elected Chairman of the Central People's Government was broadcast from the venue to every corner, the applause of the masses and the applause from the radios echoed as one. The people and their representatives welcomed the names of Chairman Mao, the six vice-chairmen, and the fifty-six members of the Central People's Government with one heart. This applause and cheers expressed the will and voice of the people of the whole country, which were completely focused on these figures who represented their bright and happy future. At this time, the streets of Beijing were lit up everywhere with brilliant clusters of lights: arc-shaped, square, rectangular, circular, five-pointed stars, and character-shaped; snow-white sunlight lamps, red lights, green lights, and yellow lights. Even ordinary households had many red star lanterns hanging on their doors. On the majestic Tiananmen Gate, the area around the giant statue of Chairman Mao and the two large horizontal banners reading "Long Live the People's Republic of China" and "Long Live the Central People's Government" were illuminated by sunlight lamps. Even the national flag in the night sky was illuminated. The dark crowds squeezed in front of the gate, looking up for a long time, unwilling to leave. On the four three-gate structures and two ornamental arches on both sides of Tiananmen Gate, large and small red star lanterns and clusters of lights were lit at the same time. The capital of the Chinese people showed an extraordinary solemnity and magnificence.

　　彩车缤纷涌上街头
    各机关团体工厂学校的彩车自动涌上街头，上面装置了毛主席、朱总司令的巨像，巨幅的标语和红布，五彩缤纷，鲜艳夺目，吸引着大群大群的观众。他们高声地唱着国歌、东方红太阳升，敲着锣鼓，有的装了扩音器向群众宣传人民政协、中央人民政府与人民政协共同纲领的性质与意义。他们大声告诉听众：“帝国主义走狗蒋介石的政府垮了，我们永不再受他们的气了，中国人民从此站立起来了……。”他们的讲演不断引起群众的欢呼与掌声。在东西长安街及前门等热闹市区，这种彩车有时拥集到七八辆以至二十辆。街上群众之多，超过任何重要的节日。
    月亮上升，电灯照亮的时候，中央人民政府的选举揭晓了。当毛主席当选中央人民政府主席的消息从会场转播到各个角落时，群众的掌声与收音机里的掌声响成了一片。人民与人民的代表心心相印地欢迎着毛主席、六个副主席与五十六个中央人民政府委员的名字。这种掌声与欢呼，表现出全国人民的意志与心声，它们完全集中在这些代表自己光明幸福的前途的人物身上了。这时的北京街头，到处亮着辉煌的灯丛：弧形的、四方形的、长方形的、圆圈的、五星的、字形的；雪白的太阳灯、红灯、绿灯、黄灯，连普通住户的门上也有许多悬了红星灯笼。在巍峨的天安门首，毛主席巨像的四周、“中华人民共和国万岁”与“中央人民政府万岁”两幅大横标语的四周，被太阳灯围得雪亮。连夜空里的国旗都照得出来。黑压压的人群都挤在门首久久地探望，不肯离去。在天安门两侧的四道三座门与两道牌楼上，大小红星灯笼与灯丛都同时照亮。中国人民的首都显出异乎寻常的庄严壮丽。
