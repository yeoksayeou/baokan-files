[Reported by our newspaper] November 12th is the tenth anniversary of the death of international friend Bethune. The Political Department of the Health Department of the North China Military Region issued commemorative instructions: "Comrade Bethune, dispatched by the Canadian and American Communist Parties, arrived in Yan'an in April 1938. In June, he went to the front line of the Jin-Cha-Ji region. In the extremely difficult rural guerrilla environment with limited medical equipment and technology, he founded the Model International Peace Hospital (now the Bethune International Peace Hospital in Shijiazhuang) and the Bethune Medical School (now the North China Medical University), embodying the internationalist spirit of 'treating the cause of the Chinese people's liberation as his own with absolutely no selfish motives.' He personally went to the front lines and treated a large number of wounded and sick soldiers. Under the influence of his education and exemplary actions, he cultivated a large number of new medical workers. In a year and a half of work, he made indelible great contributions to the Chinese people. In the past, all liberated areas launched enthusiastic campaigns to learn from Dr. Bethune and achieved great results. Today, when the national revolution has basically achieved victory, commemorating Dr. Bethune and carrying out health construction has its own special significance." The purpose of commemorating Dr. Bethune, the instructions state, "is to promote the internationalist spirit, the proletarian medical and technical viewpoint, the revolutionary qualities of loving the wounded and sick, and the working style of hard struggle to overcome all difficulties of the people's medical workers exemplified by Dr. Bethune. To educate all medical and health workers, improve the political level of Marxism-Leninism and the literacy of medical science, and truly combine excellent technology with political responsibility. Under the banner of Bethune, gradually achieve the goal of building regularized hospitals for the people's army." Regarding the specific methods of commemoration, the instructions stipulate:
　　(1) Before and after November 12th, all units should spend half a month using Bethune and Arnulf and the Bethune Memorial Album (being printed) as materials, focusing on the points pointed out in Chairman Mao's article "In Memory of Norman Bethune," to conduct universal and profound publicity and education among all staff members, especially medical personnel, so that everyone clearly understands Bethune's great spirit, takes it as a model, establishes a correct medical attitude, and transforms their work style to achieve the goal of caring for convalescents. (2) On November 12th, all units should hold grand commemorative meetings for the entire hospital, where responsible comrades will report on Bethune's exemplary deeds and how we should learn from Bethune. Educational evening parties and wall newspaper special issues can also be organized. (3) After the report, discussion meetings should be held separately to discuss specific ways to learn from Bethune in caring for the wounded and sick, so that our hospitals can take a step forward in accordance with the basic aspects of regularization. (4) The "North China People's Liberation Army" newspaper and "Health Construction" will publish special issues at that time, and should also plan to organize the supply of manuscripts to the People's Daily to expand external publicity. All units should organize specialized manuscripts. The Medical University and the Peace Hospital should provide detailed introductions from a historical perspective (the characteristics of the Bethune Medical School, its role and excellent traditions in the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, and its future direction), and continuously report on the progress of the Bethune commemoration, with all manuscripts sent to the Political Department for forwarding. (5) By the end of December, a comprehensive summary report on the progress of the commemoration should be submitted to the Party Committee of the Ministry.
　　[Another dispatch] In order to commemorate Dr. Bethune, after joint discussions between the Ministry of Health and the Medical University, it was decided that in early November, a joint visiting group composed of medical workers from the Beijing-Tianjin Two Army General Hospitals and Beijing-Tianjin would go to visit the North China Medical University and the International Peace Hospital founded by Dr. Bethune, in order to jointly study, learn from each other, and exchange experiences, and commemorate the great international friend Comrade Bethune with practical actions to improve hospital work. The Medical University and the Peace Hospital are now preparing to welcome them. (Mei Ling)
