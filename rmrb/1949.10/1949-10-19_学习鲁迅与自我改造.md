Learning from Lu Xun and Self-Reform
    Mao Dun

    I have heard people say more than once, at different times and places, that many young people can understand Lu Xun's novels, but not his essays. Those who say such things, including those who are still young, often add: "However, everyone believes that essays occupy a very important place in Lu Xun's works. Not understanding his essays is equivalent to not understanding most of Lu Xun!"

    Not only young people, but some middle-aged people also feel the same way—but they find it a bit difficult to understand the parts of Lu Xun's essays that involve the ideological struggles in the literary world at that time. Therefore, there is an opinion that some parts of Lu Xun's essays (especially the later ones) should be explained.

    To understand the development of Lu Xun's thought, one must study his essays. To be good at learning from Lu Xun, a thorough understanding of the process of his ideological development is certainly good, even necessary. This point has now become a consensus, especially because there have been instances of not being good at learning from Lu Xun and making major mistakes in thought.

    When it comes to those who have done thorough and profound research on the development of Lu Xun's thought, Qu Qiubai must be regarded as the foremost. In the preface to "Selected Essays of Lu Xun," he used the Marxist-Leninist viewpoint to analyze the factors that played a decisive role in the development of Lu Xun's thought, pointing out that Lu Xun later "evolved from the theory of evolution to the theory of class, from a rebellious son and disloyal subject of the gentry class to a true friend and even a warrior of the proletariat and the working masses. He experienced a quarter of a century of struggle from before the Xinhai Revolution to the present, bringing valuable revolutionary traditions to the new camp from painful experience and profound observation." This individualism is a bourgeois illusion common among intellectuals, but in China at that time... objectively still had considerable revolutionary significance." Qu Qiubai emphasized that Lu Xun's early works, "because they can at least reflect the true image of society and hint at the direction that reform should pay attention to," are still revolutionary literature, "but at the same time, these early revolutionary writers, reflecting the process of the collapse of the feudal patriarchal society, often cannot immediately abandon individualism—the tendency to doubt the masses. They can see the selfishness, blindness, superstition, self-deception, and even docile servility of the masses—the masses of peasant small private owners, but they often cannot see the revolutionary possibilities of these masses, and cannot see the revolutionary value hidden behind their clumsy and conservative slogans. Some of Lu Xun's essays often have these kinds of shortcomings, causing him some disappointment and pessimism about the failure of the revolution."

    It is clear that such profound and correct criticism does not diminish Lu Xun's value, but on the contrary, it is enough to show Lu Xun's greatness. However, in the years after Lu Xun's death, Qu Qiubai's insightful comments were unfortunately ignored. The most extreme view was that Lu Xun's thought only had development, but did not recognize how painful the process of self-criticism was that his development had gone through. Therefore, it was also impossible to recognize that Lu Xun's early thought was a burden in the development of his own thought. What we should learn is precisely how Lu Xun himself put down this burden, and we should not pick up the burden that Lu Xun put down and be complacent, thinking that we have learned the spirit of Lu Xun.

    There is no need to shy away from the fact that in the past decade, some young people have been enlightened by Lu Xun's early thought, but unfortunately they could enter but not exit, and eventually made major historical mistakes in their thinking. Still others picked up two or three viewpoints from Lu Xun's early thought, claiming to have uniquely obtained its secrets, and issued opinions to mislead themselves and others.

    Such errors in learning, although not to be regarded as a universal phenomenon, are indeed too serious to be ignored. In order to learn from Lu Xun better, we need to study, analyze, and understand the process of the development of Lu Xun's thought. We should continue the work that Qu Qiubai has done. My personal experience is limited, and I have only read a few papers on the study of Lu Xun's thought. It seems that there are not many who can carry forward Qu Qiubai's views. But I would especially like to introduce to readers Hu Sheng's "The Road of Lu Xun's Thought Development" (see "Selected Critical Essays from the Masses Literature and Art Series") and Feng Xuefeng's "Research on Lu Xun's Relationship with Russian Literature" (Fiction Monthly, Volume 3, Issue 1). The former, in particular, is of great help to young people.

    To be good at learning from Lu Xun, one must first understand the road of Lu Xun's thought development. There are many things in Lu Xun's thought and works that we can learn from, but today, when intellectuals especially need self-reform, the process that Lu Xun experienced from evolution to class theory, from individualism to collectivism, is especially worth our attention and learning. We are in a new era. Political leadership and ideological leadership are both encouraging us to reform ourselves. This is different from Lu Xun's time. We are much luckier than Lu Xun. We must not fail to live up to this good fortune.

### 学习鲁迅与自我改造

　　学习鲁迅与自我改造
    茅盾
    曾经不止一处、一时，听到不同的人说：有不少青年能够看懂鲁迅的小说，却看不懂他的杂文。说这样的话的人们中间也有仍然是青年的，那就常常会拖一句道：“可是，大家又认为在鲁迅的作品中，杂文占的地位极重要，看不懂他的杂文，就等于不能懂得大半个鲁迅！”
    不光是青年，有些中年人也同抱此感，——不过他们看上去觉得有点不易懂的是鲁迅杂文中那些牵涉到当时文坛上思想斗争的部分。因而就有这样一种意见：鲁迅的杂文的若干部分（尤其是后期的），最好能加以说明。
    要明白鲁迅思想的发展，不能不研究他的杂文；而要善于学习鲁迅，则对于他的思想发展的过程有一个彻底的了解，当然是好的，甚至是必要的。这一点，现在差不多已成为一致的认识，特别是因为有了不善于学习鲁迅而在思想上犯了重大错误，这样的事情。
    对于鲁迅思想的发展作了透澈精深的研究的，不能不推瞿秋白氏为第一人。在“鲁迅杂感选集”的序言中，他运用马列主义的观点分析了鲁迅思想发展中起着决定作用的要素，指出鲁迅之后“进化论进到阶级论，从绅士阶级的逆子贰臣进到无产阶级和劳动群众的真正的友人以至于战士，他是经历了辛亥革命以前直到现在的四分之一世纪的战斗，从痛苦的经验和深刻的观察之中带着宝贵的革命传统到新的阵营里来的。”这种个性主义是一般的知识分子的资产阶级性的幻想，然而在当时的中国……客观上还有相当的革命意义。”瞿秋白更着重地指出鲁迅早期的作品，“因为它至少还能够反映社会真象的方面，暗示改革所应当注意的方向”，故仍不失为革命文学，“而同时，这些早期的革命作家，反映着封建宗法社会崩溃的过程，时常不是立刻就能够离开个性主义——怀疑群众的倾向的。他们看得见群众——农民小私有者群众的自私、盲目、迷信、自欺、甚至驯服的奴隶性，可是，往往看不见这种群众的革命可能性，看不见他们的笨拙的守旧口号背后隐藏着的革命价值。鲁迅的一些杂感里面，往往有这一类的缺点，引起他对革命失败的一些失望和悲观。”
    很明白，这样深刻正确的批评，并不损害鲁迅的价值，而相反，适足以见鲁迅之伟大。但是在鲁迅逝世以后若干年中，瞿秋白的这些精辟的议论不幸被忽略了，最极端的看法，则只认鲁迅思想有发展而不认它的发展曾经通过了怎样苦痛的自我批判的过程，因而也就不能认识到鲁迅前期思想在他本人思想的发展上是一种包袱，我们所应学习的，正是鲁迅自己怎样放下这包袱，而不应当拾取鲁迅所放下的这个包袱而扬扬自满，以为学到了鲁迅的精神了。
    不必讳言，近十年来，有过一些青年从鲁迅的前期思想中得到了启蒙，却可惜能入而不能出，终于在思想上犯了重大的时代错误。更有人则在鲁迅的前期思想中拈取二三论点，便自诩为独得其秘，发为议论，以自误误人。
    这样的学习上的错误，虽然不宜视为普遍的现象，但其严重性，实在也不容忽略。为要向鲁迅学习得更好，我们就有研究、分析、了解鲁迅思想发展过程之必要。瞿秋白所做过的工作，我们应当继续下去做。个人见闻孤陋，只读过少数的研究鲁迅思想的论文，觉得能够发扬瞿秋白的观点的，似乎还不多。可是我要特别向读者介绍胡绳的“鲁迅思想发展的道路”（见于“大众文艺丛刊批评论文选集”），和冯雪峰的“关于鲁迅和俄罗斯文学关系的研究”（小说月刊三卷一期）。尤其是前者，对于青年有很大的帮助。
    要善于学习鲁迅，必先明白鲁迅思想发展的道路；鲁迅的思想和作品中，可供我们学习者甚多，但在今天，知识分子特别需要自我改造之时，鲁迅所经历的从进化论到阶级论，从个性主义到集体主义的过程，尤其值得我们注意学习。我们是在新时代，政治上的领导和思想上的领导，都是鼓励我们自我改造的，这与鲁迅当年不同，我们比鲁迅幸运得多。要不虚负这幸运才好。
