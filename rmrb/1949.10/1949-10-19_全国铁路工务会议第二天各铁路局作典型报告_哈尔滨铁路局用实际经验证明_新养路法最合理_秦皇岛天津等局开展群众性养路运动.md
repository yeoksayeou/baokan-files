The National Railway Engineering Conference continued on the 14th, with various railway bureaus presenting reports on model work. Li Junping, Director of the Engineering Department of the Northeast Harbin Bureau, introduced the new track maintenance method, using the practical experience of implementing the new method in the Northeast to prove that it is the most scientific and reasonable. The most important thing in implementing this method is to open up the minds of cadres and oppose conservatism. Wang Jiarui, Director of the Acheng Engineering Section in Northeast China, said in his report on the experience of the track maintenance responsibility system: The so-called responsibility system means that everyone should be responsible; but everyone must have a responsibility to bear, so there must be a work rate standard. Tasks such as lifting tracks, turning sleepers, and replacing sleepers should be regulated, and done step by step, so that no one can be lazy. In track maintenance work, the person in charge participates personally, discovers problems, and raises them in a timely manner to improve work. Since the Acheng Engineering Section implemented the new track maintenance method in April, the work reaching good standards increased from only 7 percent in May to 85 percent in September.
    Jing Diangui, a track maintenance foreman from the Ang'angxi Section of the Qiqihar Bureau in Northeast China, said in his report on their "New Track Lifting Method," "Our method mainly uses new technology to save manpower." The old track lifting method used ordinary four-sided picks, and each worker could only strike 40 sleeper heads in eight hours. The new method can strike 90 sleeper heads, improving work efficiency by one time.
    The combination of workers and technicians is a very important issue in the current industrial construction. Yin Zhijia, Director of the Engineering Department of the Shenyang Bureau, said in his report that technicians must learn from workers. He used the example of repairing the Taizihe Railway Bridge to illustrate this point. The Taizihe Railway Bridge was one of the most severely damaged bridges on the China Changchun Railway by the enemy, and all sixteen piers were destroyed. When repairing the bridge, the weather was extremely cold, and it was impossible to drive steel sheet piles down after several attempts. At that time, the engineers were at a loss, but the workers braved the extreme cold, in a climate of minus seventeen degrees, without wearing waterproof clothing, and automatically went into the water, fighting heroically with the large ice floes, and finally completed the work.
    Sun Changzhen, Chief of the Track Maintenance Section of the Harbin Bureau in Northeast China, said vividly in his report: "In order to support the interior, we dismantled unnecessary branch lines." The Bei (An) Hei (He) line is the northernmost railway in Northeast China, with more than 200 kilometers of railway equipment in the north, which urgently needs to be collected, but the line was interrupted for 170 kilometers. In order to quickly transport the materials from the north back, the interrupted line must be repaired first. Therefore, from April 9th to September 22nd, railway employees mobilized 160,000 people, dismantling or repairing a total of 1,096 kilometers of lines, collecting more than 39,000 rails, 60 steel beams, 26 damaged locomotives, and 430 damaged passenger and freight cars, gloriously helping the interior overcome the difficulty of lacking road repair materials.
    How can track maintenance work be done well? Wang Jicheng, Director of the Public Security Section of Qinhuangdao, told everyone in his report: "A mass track maintenance movement must be launched!" Qinhuangdao's track maintenance work is a model for various bureaus in the north. They put forward the slogan of "Everyone Maintain the Tracks," mobilizing all employees, families, students and the masses to maintain and protect the tracks. They said that track maintenance work is not simply the work of the engineering department, but should be regarded as the work of all railway employees, and even the masses along the line. When they launched track maintenance work, they first cleared the minds of cadres, and organized a track maintenance committee to lead the work in a core manner. They mobilized mental laborers to participate in track maintenance, organized "mutual aid groups," launched competitions, and strived for models. The plans and implementation of track maintenance work were all discussed and formulated by the masses, so that they truly realized that track maintenance work was their own work. Before the track maintenance work was promoted, it was first necessary to widely publicize, so that everyone realized the importance of track maintenance, and stimulated everyone's enthusiasm, and then the work could be implemented, and naturally formed a mass movement. In April and May, they only mobilized more than 400 people, but by June and July, more than 600 people participated, including 160 women. After the movement was launched, it was necessary to be able to master it well, oppose bureaucracy, take care of the lives of employees, and help solve tool problems in a timely manner. When the movement came to an end, a mass inspection and summary work was launched, relying on the masses to improve track maintenance work. During the track maintenance movement in Qinhuangdao, many model workers emerged, who drove the work. In this way, Qinhuangdao's track maintenance work was commended by the Ministry of Railways. Their typical example played a great role in promoting track maintenance work in the north. Yu Lei, Director of the Engineering Department of the Tianjin Bureau, pointed out this point in his report. The track maintenance work of the Tianjin Bureau was launched under the direct leadership of Liu Jianzhang, Deputy Director of the Bureau. Like Qinhuangdao, the track maintenance work of various sections of the Tianjin Bureau also mobilized the participation of employees' families, soldiers and students. They established joint labor groups and solved tool difficulties, not only maintaining the roads well, but also rectifying the appearance of the stations. From July 18th to September 10th, in 50 days, the 118 stations of the Tianjin Bureau completed 286 kilometers of track maintenance work, making all lines look brand new. When the First Detachment of the Railway Corps reported on their rescue work, all the representatives at the meeting expressed their infinite respect for their heroic and hard work. Wang Peishan of the Zhengzhou Bureau, in his report on their track maintenance work, particularly emphasized the importance of learning from Soviet experience and promoting the responsibility system.

　　全国铁路工务会议第二天各铁路局作典型报告
    哈尔滨铁路局用实际经验证明
  　新养路法最合理
    秦皇岛天津等局开展群众性养路运动
    【本报讯】铁道部全国工务会议十四日继续进行，各铁路局作典型工作报告。东北哈尔滨局工务处李均平处长介绍了新养路法，以东北实行新养路法的实际经验，来证明新养路法为最科学最合理的养路方法。而实行这个方法，首先最重要的为打通干部思想，反对保守主义。东北阿城工务段王嘉瑞段长在报告养路负责制的经验时称：所谓负责制，就是要使人人负责；但人人必须有责可负，因此要有一个工率标准，抬道、翻枕木、换枕木等项工作应有所规定，一步跟着一步去做，谁想偷懒也不可能。在养路工作中，负责人亲自参加，发现问题，及时提出，提高工作。阿城工务段四月份实行新养路法以来，五月份工作达良好标准的仅百分之七，九月份就提高到百分之八十五。
    东北齐齐哈尔局昂昂溪段养路工长荆殿贵在报告他们的“新起道法”时说，“我们这个方法，主要是用新技术，节省人力。”旧的起道法，普通打四面镐，每工按八小时计算，只能打四十根枕木头；新法则可打成九十根，提高工作效率一倍。
    工人与技术人员互相结合，是目前工业建设中很重要的一个问题。沈阳局工务处尹之家处长报告时说，技术人员必须向工人学习。他以修复太子河大铁桥为例来说明这一点。太子河大铁桥为中长路受敌人破坏最厉害的一座桥梁，十六个桥墩全部被毁。当修复该桥时，天气严寒，打钢板桩几次打不下去，当时工程师束手无策，然而工人冒极度的寒冷，在零下十七度的气候里，没有穿防水衣，自动下水，英勇的和大冰块作斗争，终于完成了工作。
    东北哈尔滨局养路课长孙长珍在报告中生动地说：“我们为支援关内，曾把不必要的支侧线拆掉了。”北（安）黑（河）线为东北最北的一条路，北部有二百多公里的铁路器材，亟待搜集，但该线中断了一七○公里，要想把北面的材料迅速运回来，必须先把这中断线修复。因此铁路员工们从四月九日起到九月二十二日止，动员了十六万人，拆掉或修复线路共达一千零九十六公里，搜集了钢轨三万九千余根，钢梁六十孔，破损的机车二十六台，破损的客货车皮四百三十辆。光荣地帮助了关内修路材料缺乏的困难。
    怎样才能把养路工作做好呢？秦皇岛公安段长王继成报告中告诉大家说：“要展开一个群众性的养路运动！”秦皇岛养路工作是北方各局的模范。他们提出“人人养路”的口号，动员所有职工、家属、学生和群众来养路护路。他们说，养路工作不单纯是工务部门的工作，要把它看作是全体铁路职工，以至沿线群众的工作之一。在他们展开养路工作时，首先搞通干部思想，组织了养路委员会，有核心地领导工作。发动脑力劳动者参加养路，组织“互助组”，展开竞赛，争取模范。养路工作的计划和实施，都由群众来讨论、制定，使他们真正认识到养路工作是他们自己的工作。养路工作推行之前，首先要广泛宣传，使大家认识到养路的重要性，鼓动起大家的热情，然后才能把工作贯彻下去，自然形成了群众性的运动。他们在四、五月只动员了四百余人，到六、七月，就有六百多人参加，其中妇女有一百六十人。运动展开后，要能很好的掌握。反对官僚主义；要照顾职工的生活，及时帮助解决工具问题。运动告一段落时，又展开了群众性的检查和总结工作，依靠群众，提高养路工作。在秦皇岛养路运动中，曾涌现了不少模范工作者，他们带动了工作。这样，秦皇岛养路工作，曾获得铁道部的嘉奖。他们的典型例范，对推动北方养路工作起了很大作用。天津局工务处于磊处长就曾在报告中指出了这点。天津局养路工作是在该局刘建章副局长直接领导下，展开起来的。和秦皇岛一样，天津局各段养路工作亦曾发动了职工家属、战士和学生们参加，他们建立了联合劳动组，解决了工具困难，不仅把路养好，而且整顿站容。从七月十八日起到九月十日止，五十天当中，天津局一百一十八个站，完成了二百八十六公里的养路工作，使各线焕然一新。铁道兵团第一支队在报告他们的抢修工作时，全场到会代表对他们的英勇奋斗精神，表示无限的敬意。郑州局王培善在报告他们的养路工作时，特别强调学习苏联经验，推行负责制的重要性。
