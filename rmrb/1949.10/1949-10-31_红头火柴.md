　　Red-Headed Matches
　　Soviet engineers and railway engineering experts, Comrades Gorchin and two others, were passing through Shijiazhuang on their way to Taiyuan. During a break while changing trains, some cadres from Shijiazhuang held a temporary welcoming meeting at the Railway Trade Union. The host struck a match to light the guests' cigarettes. The red-headed match, struck against the glued, rough, sandy striker, made a loud "pop!" sound and emitted a sulfurous, burning odor. The host said apologetically, "Ugh, these matches are really..."
　　"It's really not as good as a lighter," another staff member said, as if to excuse the situation.
　　"This is good," our guest, Engineer Gorchin, said, "When the Soviet revolution had just succeeded, matches were like this too. They were made by our workers themselves under difficult conditions." As he spoke, he took out a box of Chinese-made red-headed matches from his pocket, pulled out one, and lit his own cigarette.

　　红头火柴
    苏联工程师铁路工程专家果尔钦等三人路过石家庄到太原去，在换车休息的时候，石家庄一些干部在铁路工会举行一个临时的欢迎会。主人划一根火柴给客人点烟，红头火柴撞在胶着粗糙的碎沙盒面上，“拍！”的一声发出个很大的爆炸，并散出一股硫磺燃烧的臭气，主人很难为情地说：“咳，这火柴真是……。”
    “这真不如自来火。”另一个招待员象解嘲似的这样说。
    “这是好的，”我们的客人工程师果尔钦说：“当苏联革命刚成功的时候，火柴也是这样，这是我们工人在克服困难条件下自己制造的。”他说着从口袋里掏出一盒中国制的红头火柴，抽出一根，点燃了他自己的香烟。
