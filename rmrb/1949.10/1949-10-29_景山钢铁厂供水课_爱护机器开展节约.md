　　Jingshan Iron and Steel Plant Water Supply Section
    Cherishing Machines and Practicing Thrift

    [Report from this newspaper] The Jingshan Iron and Steel Plant's Water Supply Section is launching a thrift campaign in all pump houses, conserving manpower and resources and cherishing machines. Workers in the Water Supply Section are actively responding to the call, trying every means to cherish machines and save raw materials. The Yongding River North and South Pump Houses of this section have a total of five water pumps. In the past, they used ten gallons of motor oil every week, but now the monthly oil consumption has been reduced to ten gallons, saving three-quarters of the oil. In the past, all the electric lights were 500-candlepower, but now they have been replaced with 100-candlepower. In the past, the designated shift for Goulongtou [a place] was three shifts totaling six people, but now five people have been reduced, leaving only one person on the late-night shift, with the other two shifts being done by the pump operators. In the past, the large water pump in the South Pump House would either break down or the motor would malfunction every summer when the river water rose. This summer was different. The workers came up with many ways to protect the machines, and as a result, no problems occurred at all.

　　景山钢铁厂供水课　
    爱护机器开展节约
    【本报讯】石景山钢铁厂供水课各泵房展开节约运动，俭用人力物力爱护机器。供水课职工积极响应号召，想尽办法爱护机器节省原料，该课永定河南北泵房共五盘水泵，过去每星期用十加仑马达油，现在每月用油量减至十加仑，节省了四分之三。电灯过去都是五百烛光的，现在改用一百烛光；过去勾龙头的指定工三班共六个人，现在减去五个人，仅后夜留一个人，其它两班均由看泵的工人代作。南泵房的大水泵每逢夏季河水涨时，不是泵发生故障就是电动机出毛病，今年夏季就不同了，职工们想了很多办法保护机器，结果一点毛病也没有发生。
