Xinhua News Agency, South China Front, 27th – A frontline reporter reports on the pursuit and annihilation of four fleeing enemy armies in the southwestern Guangzhou area, stating: The several tens of thousands of remnant enemies from four armies and one army corps, who fled southwest from Guangzhou, were completely annihilated in the Yangjiang area on the 26th. These bandit troops were scattered and fled from the Guangzhou area around the time of the People's Liberation Army's liberation of Guangzhou. Except for a portion that fled in a southeasterly direction, the majority concentrated on fleeing southwest from Guangzhou, attempting to escape to Hainan Island or Guangxi. The People's Liberation Army on the South China Front immediately pursued in two routes. The eastern route advanced east along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, sweeping through the vast areas along the railway and both banks of the East River, successively liberating key towns in eastern Guangdong such as Huiyang and Boluo. On the 15th, they annihilated four regiments of remnant bandits in Xintang, northeast of Guangzhou, and on the 19th, they forced the 154th Division of the 109th Army of remnant bandits to surrender in Longhua Market. The western route of the People's Liberation Army, in order to cut off the escape route of the westward-fleeing remnant bandits, the vanguard unit marched south day and night, disregarding the successive stubborn resistance of the remnant bandits on both banks of the North River, advancing 160 *li* in one night. On the afternoon of the 15th, they liberated Sanshui, the confluence point of the North River and West River and a crucial transportation hub connecting Guangdong and Guangxi, and forced Zeng Yuansan, commander of the remnant 103rd Division of the Kuomintang army, to surrender. On the 16th, they defeated the 13th Army Corps headquarters southwest of Sihui, and on the 17th, they intercepted the headquarters of the 70th Army of bandits near Gaoyao, completely annihilating its guard battalion.

After suffering successive heavy blows, the remnant bandits hastily turned south to flee. The People's Liberation Army then divided into three routes to bravely pursue them. The left route went from Sanshui and Nanhai, via Xinhui and Heshan, to Taishan; the right route went from Sihui, via Gaoyao and Xinxing, to Yangchun; and the central route went from Sanshui, via Gaoming and Kaiping, to Enping. The three routes of the army overcame all difficulties along the way, advancing by land and water, and hurrying to catch up. On the 18th, the 8th and 9th companies of a certain regiment annihilated the entire 441st Regiment of the 147th Division of bandit troops in the Gaoming area, creating a model example of two companies completely annihilating an entire regiment of enemy bandits. The Third Security Brigade of the Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters of the bandits was completely annihilated north of Xinxing City, and the puppet commander Ye Chao was captured alive. The remnants of the 91st Division of bandits, including the division commander and deputy division commander, were forced to surrender in the suburbs of West Heshan City. Local remnant bandits, such as the Sanshui puppet police bureau, came to surrender one after another. The Liberation Army also annihilated the entire Second Security Division of bandits when liberating Enping and Taishan. On the 23rd, the three routes of the southward army advanced to the south of Enping and Yangchun, converging and compressing the enemy in the Enping and Yangjiang areas.

The remnant bandits, after being pursued day and night by the Liberation Army, were routed and demoralized, losing their will to fight. According to prisoners, most of the bandit army's senior officers had already slipped away, officers could not control their soldiers, subordinates could not find their commanders, and there were frequent incidents of remnant bandits from various units vying for routes, quarreling, fighting, and even shooting at each other. There were many trucks burned by fleeing bandits on the highway from Enping to Yangjiang, and military clothing discarded along the way was everywhere.

On the 23rd, the three routes of the Liberation Army, which were fiercely pursuing the fleeing enemy, converged in the area south of Enping and Yangchun, compressing the enemy between Enping and Yangjiang. The bandit army originally attempted to escape by boat in Yangjiang, but a unit of the Liberation Army advanced rapidly, completing a roundabout encirclement of the enemy. On the evening of the 24th, they liberated Yangjiang County and Beijin Port at the mouth of the Moyang River, finally sealing off the enemy's sea escape route and surrounding them in the narrow area of Baisha Market and Pinggang Market, southwest of Yangjiang City. The trapped remnant bandits initially thought they were surrounded by "guerrilla forces," so the 50th Army of bandits concentrated three divisions on the 25th to break through with all their strength, but they were repelled by us and a portion was annihilated. When the enemy discovered that they were surrounded by a large army, they were immediately thrown into chaos. The Liberation Army then tightened the encirclement and launched a general offensive against the bandit troops on the evening of the 25th. As soon as three regiments of bandits came into contact, they laid down their weapons. By noon on the 26th, all the bandit troops who had fled to the area were annihilated. According to preliminary investigation, the annihilated bandit troops included Liu Anqi's bandit unit, the 21st Army Corps and its subordinate 50th Army, and Shen Fazao's bandit unit, the 13th Army Corps' 23rd Army, the 70th Army, and all of the 39th Army of the Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters.

　　我军三路穷追广州逃敌残匪数万被歼阳江地区            
    ——前线记者报道歼匪四个军经过
    【新华社华南前线二十七日电】前线记者报道广州西南地区追歼逃匪四个军的经过称：由广州向西南逃窜的残敌四个军及一个兵团部数万人已于二十六日在阳江地区全部被歼。这些匪军都是在人民解放军解放广州前后从广州地区四散逃命的，除一部向东南方向逃逸外，大部集中向广州西南逃窜，妄图逃往琼崖或广西。华南前线人民解放军当即分两路追击，东路沿广九铁路东进，横扫铁路沿线及东江两岸广大地区，相继解放粤东重镇惠阳及博罗等城镇，十五日在广州东北新塘歼残匪四个团，十九日在龙华圩迫使残匪一零九军一五四师投降。西路人民解放军为切断西窜残匪逃路，先头某部不顾北江两岸残匪的节节顽抗，日夜兼程南下，一夜前进一百六十里，十五日下午八时解放北江，西江会合点及粤桂交通要冲的三水，并迫使国民党军残部一零三师师长曾元三投降。十六日在四会西南将敌十三兵团部击溃，十七日又在高要附近截击匪七十军军部，全歼其警卫营。
    残匪连受重创后，即仓皇折向南逃。人民解放军乃分兵三路奋勇穷追。左路自三水、南海经新会、鹤山到达台山；右路自四会经高要、新兴而抵阳春；中路则自三水经由高明、开平进至恩平。三路大军排除沿途一切困难，水陆并进，兼程追赶。十八日某团第八连及第九连在高明地区歼灭匪军一四七师四四一团全部，创造两个连全歼整团敌匪的模范战例。新兴城北全歼匪广州绥署保安第三总队，生俘伪司令叶超。匪九十一师正副师长以下残部于西鹤山城郊被迫投降。地方残匪如三水伪警察局等均纷来归降。解放军并于解放恩平、台山时歼匪保安二师全部。南下三路解放军二十三日进至恩平、阳春以南会师，将敌压缩在恩平、阳江地区。
    残匪经解放军昼夜穷追，溃不成军，失魂落魄，丧失斗志。据俘虏供称：匪军主官大多已先行溜走，军官控制不住士兵，部属找不到主官，而各部残匪之间争相夺路、吵骂殴打以至相互开枪者时有所闻。恩平至阳江公路上逃匪烧毁的卡车很多，沿途丢掉的军用衣物随处可见。
    二十三日，猛追逃敌的三路解放军在恩平、阳春以南地区会师，将敌人压缩在恩平阳江间。匪军本来企图在阳江登船逃跑，但解放军一部神速前进，对敌完成迂回包围，二十四日晚八时解放阳江县城及漠阳江口之北津港，最后封闭了敌人海上逃路，将其包围于阳江城西南白沙圩、平岗圩的狭小地区。被困残匪初尚以为被“游击队”包围，因此匪五十军于二十五日还集中三个师全力突围，当遭我击退，并被歼一部。当敌发现已被大军包围后，顿形混乱。解放军继即紧缩包围，于二十五日黄昏向匪军发起总攻，匪三个团一经接触，即行放下武器。至二十六日中午即逃至该地区的匪军全部被歼。据初步清查，被歼的匪军包括刘安琪匪部二十一兵团及其所属五十军及沈发藻匪部十三兵团的二十三军、七十军与广州绥署三十九军全部。
