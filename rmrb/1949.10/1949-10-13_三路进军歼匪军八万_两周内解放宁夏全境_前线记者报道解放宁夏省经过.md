Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, December 12th: A frontline reporter reports on the People's Liberation Army's liberation of Ningxia Province, stating: While the First Field Army of the People's Liberation Army was advancing towards the Hexi Corridor in Gansu, it launched a large-scale advance into Ningxia Province via multiple routes. In less than two weeks, it annihilated 80,000 of the Ning Ma bandit troops and liberated the entirety of Ningxia Province. The People's Liberation Army advanced towards Ningxia from Gansu in three routes starting in early September.

　　　　Left Route
Departing from Lanzhou along the left bank of the Yellow River, the PLA captured Jingyuan County, over a hundred li northeast of Lanzhou, on September 6th, followed by Jingtai County on the 15th. Zhang Qinwu, the brigade commander of the remnant Hu Zongnan bandit troops' First Cavalry Brigade, who was roaming in the area, led more than 450 men to surrender to the PLA. When this route of the PLA advanced towards Zhongwei, Ningxia, beyond the Great Wall ruins in the north, the areas they passed through were mostly barren grasslands and deserts, sparsely populated and lacking firewood and food. Sometimes, when camping at night, they encountered heavy rain. The commanders and soldiers used wheat straw in their padded quilts as tent frames, digging pits in the ground inside the tents, padding them with sand, and sleeping on the grass. Finally, they overcame the difficulties, weathered the rain and cold, and advanced swiftly and bravely, reaching the Zhongwei area.

　　　　Right Route
The PLA departed from the area north of Guyuan in Gansu, suddenly entered Ningxia on the 12th, occupied Tongxin, and took advantage of the victory to defeat the 20th Regiment of the 10th Cavalry Brigade of the Ning Ma bandits, liberating Zhongning on the 14th.

　　　　Middle Route
At the same time, braving gales and torrential rain, the PLA crossed mountains and ridges and suddenly appeared in the Changlebao and Gaojiatuan areas on the right bank of the Yellow River south of Zhongwei on the 16th. The remnant bandit troops of the Ning Ma 81st Army and other units were either driven by the PLA from the south bank of the Yellow River to the east bank, or from the east bank to the west bank, panicking and in total disarray. The PLA soldiers, on the other hand, fiercely pursued, capturing the remnants of the bandits in the Yellow River mudflats that reached their knees. In just two hours of combat, a certain regiment annihilated the entire 881st Regiment and most of the 103rd Regiment of the 294th Division of the Ma bandits' 81st Army, capturing alive 1,833 Ma bandits in addition to those killed and wounded. Under the powerful influence of the victorious advance of the PLA, Ma Jing, the commander of the 81st Army of the Ning Ma bandits, first accepted the peace terms on September 19th, concentrating his troops in the suburbs of Zhongwei to await reorganization by the People's Liberation Army. After the representative of the 81st Army signed the agreement, Lu Zhongliang, the commander of the Ma bandit's 128th Army, and his 128th Army and 11th Army still attempted to make a last-ditch struggle relying on the strategic terrain of Qingtongxia in Jinji County. Ma Degui, the commander of the Ningxia Ma bandit National Militia, was even more vicious, plotting to dig up the dikes and flood the Jinji, Lingwu, and Wuzhongbao areas, turning them into marshes in order to stop the advance of the People's Liberation Army. The right-wing liberation army that arrived in the Zhongning area, in order to save the people, then divided into two routes, advancing day and night. One part first liberated Wuzhongbao, the commercial center between Jinji and Lingwu, on the 20th, and quickly went straight to Lingwu, surrounding the city. Another part departed from Zhongning, occupied Qingtongxia on the 19th, and after a 160-li day-and-night forced march, arrived in Jinji at 6:00 AM on the 21st, surrounding the Ma bandit's 128th Army on three sides (the Yellow River is on the north side of the city). All the commanders and soldiers of the Liberation Army attacked bravely, liberating the two cities of Jinji and Lingwu in one fell swoop, thwarting the remnant bandits' plot to release water. In addition to those killed and wounded, 4,977 bandit soldiers were captured alive. The main force of the Ning Ma bandit army, the 128th Army, was basically annihilated. At this time, the other army commanders and division commanders of the remnant bandit troops jointly requested to surrender, and on the 22nd, sent representatives across the Yellow River to the frontline headquarters of the People's Liberation Army in Zhongning to negotiate. General Yang Dezhi, commander of the 19th Corps of the People's Liberation Army, was ordered to submit peace terms to the other side, stipulating that the remaining reactionary troops in Ningxia should send representatives to sign the agreement before 12:00 on the 24th in order to peacefully resolve the Ningxia issue. Subsequently, Lu Zhongliang, the commander of the Kuomintang 128th Army, and Ma Tingxiu, the secretary-general of the Kuomintang Ningxia Provincial Government, also came on the 23rd to request surrender. General Yang Dezhi accepted their request. On the afternoon of the same day at 2:00 PM, the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Ningxia was formally signed. The People's Liberation Army crossed the Yellow River to the west on the evening of the 23rd and stationed in Yinchuan City, the capital of Ningxia Province, receiving a warm welcome from the people. Urban order was quickly restored. Afterwards, large armies crossed the Yellow River in a steady stream and stationed in Pingluo, Shizuizi, and Dengkou north of Yinchuan; a part crossed the Helan Mountains. On the 29th, it arrived at Dingyuanying, the capital of Alxa League, and Alxa League and Ejin Banner were also quickly and peacefully liberated.

    前线记者报道解放宁夏省经过
    【新华社兰州十二日电】前线记者报道人民解放军解放宁夏省经过称：人民解放军第一野战军于向甘肃河西走廊进军同时，分路向宁夏省大举进军，在不到两周的时间内即消灭了宁马匪军八万之众解放了宁夏省全境。人民解放军于九月初自甘肃分三路向宁夏前进。
    　　　　左路
    自兰州沿黄河左岸进发，于九月六日攻占兰州东北百余里的靖远县城，继于十五日攻占景泰县城。流窜该地的胡宗南残余匪部骑一旅旅长张钦武率领四百五十余人向解放军投诚。该路解放军在北越长城遗迹向宁夏中卫疾进时，经过的地区大多是荒凉的草原和沙漠，沿途地广人稀，柴少粮缺。有时夜晚露营遭遇大雨，指战员们用麦秸装在夹被里作为帐棚架起，在棚内地上挖坑垫沙铺草睡觉。终于克服困难渡过了大雨和寒冷，迅速奋勇前进，到达中卫地区。
    　　　　右路
    解放军由甘肃固原以北地区出发，于十二日突然进入宁夏境内占领同心，并乘胜击溃宁马骑十旅骑二十团于十四日解放中宁。
    　　　　中路
    解放军亦于同时冒狂风暴雨翻山越岭于十六日突然出现中卫以南黄河右岸的常乐堡、高家疃地区。宁马残余匪军八十一军等部有的被解放军从黄河南岸赶到东岸，有的从东岸被赶到西岸，惊慌失措，乱作一团。解放军的战士们则猛打猛追，在陷到膝盖的黄河泥滩中捕捉残匪。某团在仅仅两小时的战斗中，即将马匪八十一军二九四师八八一团全部及一零三团大部歼灭，除毙伤外，活捉马匪一千八百三十三人。在解放军胜利进军的强大声威影响下，宁马军八一军军长马＠靖于九月十九日首先接受和平条件，集中所部在中卫城郊听候人民解放军整编。八十一军代表签字后，马匪一二八军军长卢忠良率领的一二八军及十一军还妄图凭借金积县青铜峡之险要地形作垂死挣扎，宁夏马匪国民兵团司令马得贵更穷凶极恶，阴谋掘堤放水，陷金积、灵武、吴忠堡地区尽成泽国，以阻止人民解放军前进。进抵中宁地区的右路解放大军为拯救人民，遂分途昼夜进军。一部于二十日首先解放金积、灵武间的商业中心吴忠堡，并迅速直趋灵武，将该城包围。一部由中宁出发，于十九日占领青铜峡，复经一百六十里的昼夜急行军，于二十一日晨六时进抵金积，将马匪一二八军三面包围（该城北面是黄河），解放军全体指战员奋勇攻击，一举解放金积、灵武两城，粉碎残匪放水阴谋。除毙伤外，生俘匪军四千九百七十七人。宁马匪军主力的一二八军至此基本上被歼灭。此时，军马残部其他各军军长、师长联名要求投诚，并于二十二日派代表渡过黄河到中宁人民解放军前线司令部接洽。人民解放军十九兵团司令员杨德志将军奉命以和平条件提交对方，规定宁夏残余反动军队于二十四日十二时前，派出代表签字，以和平解决宁夏问题。接着，国民党一二八军军长卢忠良及国民党宁夏省政府秘书长马廷秀等亦于二十三日前来请求投诚。杨德志将军当接受其要求。当日下午二时，和平解放宁夏问题的协议，即正式签字。人民解放军并于二十三日当晚西渡黄河，进驻宁夏省会银川市，备受人民热烈欢迎，城市秩序迅速恢复。随后大军源源渡过黄河，并分途进驻银川以北之平罗、石咀子、磴口；一部越过贺兰山脉。于二十九日进抵阿拉善旗首府定远营，阿拉善旗及额济纳旗亦迅即和平解放。
