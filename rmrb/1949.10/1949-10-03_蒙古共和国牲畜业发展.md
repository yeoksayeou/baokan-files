Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, 26th: TASS reports that the Mongolian People's Republic has completed its annual livestock survey. Preliminary figures prove that livestock breeding cooperatives and state farms have achieved new successes in developing livestock breeding in the second year of fulfilling the Five-Year Plan. The number of livestock in the republic has increased this year, and the state plan has been fulfilled by 99 percent. Seven of the eighteen provinces and dozens of districts, as well as livestock cooperatives, have exceeded the plan. According to the resolution of the Ninth Great Hural (People's Supreme Assembly) of the Mongolian People's Republic, any livestock increased by farms beyond the state plan will not be taxed, nor will they be recorded in the accounts that determine the amount of livestock products to be handed over to the state. To encourage production heroes, the government has established the honorary titles of advanced livestock breeders of the republic, provinces, and districts.
