　　Zhang City Economic Department Resolution:
　　Guarantee Supplies During Epidemic Prevention
　　Strictly Suppress Profiteering Merchants Stockpiling and Preparing to Purchase Large Quantities of Goods

　　[This Newspaper Zhangjiakou Dispatch, 30th] On the 29th, the Zhang City People's Government convened a joint meeting of various economic departments in the city, resolving to guarantee the supply of essential necessities for citizens during the epidemic prevention period and to strictly prevent and suppress a small number of profiteering merchants from taking the opportunity to hoard grain and manipulate the market. According to current estimates, Zhang City has enough grain and coal to last for two months. It has now been decided that grain, coal and iron, oil, and general merchandise companies will distribute sufficient cloth, grain, oil, and coal to citizens in an organized and planned manner through supply and marketing cooperatives. The city will purchase large quantities of daily necessities, food, and fuel from Beijing, Tianjin, Datong, and other places to stabilize the city's market and supply industrial production. For the materials collected from Beijing, Tianjin, Xuanhua, and Datong, a special transport permit from the Central People's Government will be requested.
