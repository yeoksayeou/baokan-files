　　Chahar, Hebei Regions
    Universally Launch Autumn Cultivation Campaign
    Actively Organize Manpower and Animal Power to Implement Mutual Aid
    [This newspaper's report] The autumn harvest in Chahar and Hebei provinces has basically ended, wheat planting is nearing completion, and autumn cultivation is entering a tense stage. Both the Chahar Daily and the Hebei Daily have successively published editorials on this matter, pointing out that this year's autumn cultivation is a crucial key to determining the success of next year's large-scale agricultural production campaign. Therefore, they specifically call on all regions to make careful plans, vigorously organize and lead farmers, and launch a widespread and large-scale autumn cultivation campaign. Currently, due to the earlier autumn harvest in northern Chahar and the tight grasp of leadership, the results of autumn cultivation are greater, with the entire region generally completing about 50%. The three special districts of Baoding, Xingtai, and Hengshui in Hebei have also completed wheat planting and have begun to enter autumn cultivation. Currently, this campaign has been launched vigorously and universally. For example, in order to complete the task of cultivating 800,000 mu of land in Yanggao County, Chahar Province, in addition to vigorously mobilizing all livestock in the county to fully participate in autumn cultivation, the county also organized people to pull plows and completed the cultivation of 14,000 mu of land. County party secretaries and county heads of Huailai and Wanquan counties also personally led cadres to the countryside to conduct surprise work. The second, third, fifth, and seventh districts of Zhuozhou County have universally mobilized and organized livestock and manpower. Using different leadership methods in different regions, statistics for five days show that 40,657 mu of land have been cultivated. In Dazhuang, the sixth district, all 66 available livestock and 33 sets of plows have been put into action, and more than 1,000 mu of land have now been cultivated. Currently, the biggest difficulty in autumn cultivation is the lack of animal power. Leaders in various regions are vigorously assisting the masses in organizing manpower and animal power through mutual aid, plow-sharing partnerships, proposing to "guarantee that no cow is idle" and "no manpower is idle," to achieve "the land does not freeze, the plow does not stop," and demanding 100% completion of the established autumn cultivation tasks.

　　察哈尔、河北各地　
    普遍开展秋耕运动　
    积极组织人力畜力实行互助
    【本报讯】现察哈尔、河北两省秋收已基本结束，种麦即将完成，秋耕正进入紧张阶段。察哈尔日报及河北日报均为此先后发表了社论，指出今年秋耕是决定明年农业大生产运动开展好坏的重要关键。因此，特号召各地必须精心计划，以大力组织领导农民，广泛而大规模的开展秋耕运动。目前察北由于秋收较早，领导上又抓得紧，秋耕成绩较大，全区大体已完成百分之五十左右。河北保定、邢台、衡水等三个专区也都完成种麦，已开始进入秋耕，目前这一运动已轰轰烈烈而普遍的开展起来。如察省阳高县为了完成秋耕地八十万亩的任务，除大力发动全县所有牲畜完全进入秋耕外，并组织人拉犁完成了耕地一万四千亩。怀来、万全等县的县委书记、县长等也亲自率领干部下乡进行突击。涿县二、三、五、七四个区把畜力与人力已普遍动员与组织起来。不同地区用了不同的领导方法，五天统计已耕地四万零六百五十七亩，六区大庄能使的畜力六十六头，插犋三十三套全都动了起来，现已耕地千余亩。目前秋耕中最大的困难是畜力缺乏，各地领导上正在大力协助群众组织人畜力，以互助插犋合伙方式，提出“保证不闲一条牛”，“不闲一个人力”，做到“地不冻、犁不停”，要求百分之百的完成秋耕既定任务。
