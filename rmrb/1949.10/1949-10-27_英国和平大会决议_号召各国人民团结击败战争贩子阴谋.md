Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 26th: TASS, London: Participants in the British Peace Congress enthusiastically passed the following resolution: "War is not inevitable. People with different social systems can coexist peacefully. Any new war will have disastrous and destructive effects, especially for the people of Britain. A stable peace and prosperous abundance are in the fundamental interests of the British people, as well as all other people, and this is what the people of all countries can strive for today." The resolution emphasized: "A small privileged class within the United States and Western European countries is actively promoting propaganda for a Third World War and is instigating unfounded anti-Soviet fear and hatred. The Soviet Union has repeatedly suggested full discussion and resolution of outstanding disputes, but has been ridiculed and rejected. The formation of military blocs in violation of the United Nations Charter, the launching of an arms race, and the establishment of aggressive air bases everywhere threaten the maintenance of peace. Britain can play a decisive role in combating all such war plans and in striving for the victory of the principles of international cooperation through the United Nations. The people of Britain and the world have the power to defeat the instigators of war." The resolution welcomed the growth of forces for peace in all countries. The congress called for friendship between the peoples of all countries, especially Britain, China, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union. The congress demanded an immediate reduction of armaments, a ban on the use of atomic bombs, the destruction of all stockpiles, and the implementation of controls to prevent their re-manufacture.

The congress, in its resolution, put forward the following tasks: uphold the United Nations Charter, resist all conventions and blocs aimed at weakening the United Nations, immediately stop the war in Malaya, all colonial peoples should have complete freedom, and oppose all forms of racial superiority, fascism, and anti-Semitism; support democratic and peace-loving Germans and Japanese, in order to eliminate all forms of fascism and militarism in their countries; stop Anglo-American military aid to the Athens government; stop all economic, financial, and diplomatic support for Franco's Spain; increase mutual trade with non-dollar areas, especially the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, in order to raise the people's living standards, replacing the current low living standards and the increasing political and economic dependence on the United States; develop science, art, and culture for the health and happiness of mankind, not for the destruction of mankind.

　　英国和平大会决议　
    号召各国人民团结击败战争贩子阴谋
    【新华社北京二十六日电】塔斯社伦敦讯；英国和平大会的参加者热烈地通过下列决议：“战争并不是不可避免的。不同社会制度里的人民能够和平共处。任何新的战争将具有灾祸性的毁灭效果，对英国的人民尤其是这样。稳固的和平与富足的繁荣，是英国人民，也是一切其他人民的根本利益，而这是今天各国人民所能争取得到的。”决议强调称：“一小撮美国及西欧国家内的特权阶级，正在积极进行第三次世界大战的宣传运动，而且正在挑起毫无根据的反苏恐惧及仇恨。苏联曾屡次建议充分讨论并解决彼此间未决的争端，却受到嘲笑和拒绝。违反联合国宪章的军事集团之形成，军备竞赛之发动及遍布各处的侵略性空军基地之建立，均威胁和平的维持。英国在打击一切这种战争计划，及通过联合国确保国际合作原则的胜利努力，能够起决定性的作用。英国与世界人民有打败战争挑拨者的力量”。决议对一切国家内支持和平力量的增长表示欢迎。大会号召一切国家人民之间的友好，特别是英国、中国、法国、美国和苏联。大会要求立即削灭军备，禁止使用原子弹，消毁一切存货，并施行管制，防止其再行制造。
    大会在其决议中提出了如下的任务：拥护联合国宪章，抵抗一切旨在削弱联合国的公约及集团，立即停止马来亚的战争，一切殖民地人民均应有完全的自由，并反对一切形式的种族优越论、法西斯主义、反犹太主义学说；支持民主及爱好和平的德国人和日本人，以便在他们的国家内扫除一切形式的法西斯主义及军国主义；停止英美对雅典政府的军事援助；停止对佛朗哥西班牙的一切经济、财政及外交的支持；应增加与非美元地区，特别是苏联及人民民主国家间的相互贸易，以提高人民的生活水平，代替目前生活水平的低落及政治经济上对美国日益加深的倚赖性；为了人类的健康与幸福而发展科学、艺术及文化，不是为了人类的毁灭而发展科学、艺术及文化。
