[Beijing News] Since August, the Beijing Machine Factory of North China Machine Manufacturing Company has implemented a unified procurement system. However, it discovered shortcomings such as inflexible raw material supply. Therefore, it revised the procurement method at the end of September. Since the implementation of unified procurement, the materials required by the three branch factories have been purchased and distributed by the general factory in a unified manner, enabling the general factory to grasp the overall situation, flexibly allocate the stock of each factory, reduce procurement personnel, and save procurement costs. Later, due to the inability to flexibly utilize raw material supply, after a review at the administrative work meeting of the factory on September 20, it was considered that the reasons for the inflexible supply of raw materials were: (1) Production tasks are determined according to customer needs, and material preparation is based on temporary procurement according to orders. Buy materials for whatever task is at hand, using the deposit to buy. (2) Insufficient working capital to purchase and store a certain amount of spare materials. The factory's predecessor was a repair shop, and most of the stored materials are not suitable and insufficient. (3) The old system has been abolished, and the new system is not yet sound. Business is also unfamiliar. Material cards, budget statements, material warehouse accounts, etc., are all new things and cannot be used flexibly. (4) Procurement personnel are all promoted workers, and business is not yet familiar. Small auxiliary materials are more scattered, making it more difficult to supply them in a timely manner. In response to these shortcomings, based on the actual situation of production tasks, material storage, manpower, and the degree of implementation of the system, the procurement method was revised. The general factory and branch factories divided the work. The main, large-volume, and materials that cannot be bought in Beijing are purchased by the general factory in a unified manner. General auxiliary materials can be purchased by the branch factories themselves after being approved by the general factory. The materials department and the engineering department of the general factory clearly stipulate the names of the materials supplied by the general factory and those purchased by the branch factories themselves. The materials department regularly prepares materials for one month's consumption. The branch factories have a considerable amount of working capital. Temporarily needed auxiliary materials can be purchased as needed without making a budget. When the general factory assigns production tasks, if the main materials cannot be issued in time, the order form will indicate when the materials will arrive. Since the implementation of the revised method, although the staff is not familiar enough with the new system, and the connection between the branch factory and the general factory is sometimes delayed due to non-compliance with procedures, the material supply is much more flexible than before. The basic difficulties that still exist are the lack of sufficient revolving funds and the fact that production tasks are not fixed. For example, this time we are making coal feeders, and next time we are making water cranes and screws, so we cannot proactively purchase and store materials. After these two problems are solved, the budget system and unified procurement can greatly reduce the trouble for the branch factories and promote production efficiency.

### 北京机器厂　修正统一采购方法　主料副料总厂分厂分工购买

　　北京机器厂
    修正统一采购方法
    主料副料总厂分厂分工购买
    【北京讯】华北机器制造公司北京机器厂自八月份起，实行统一采购制度，但发现原料供应不灵活等缺点，乃于九月底修正采购办法。该厂自实行统一采购后，三个分厂需用的材料，都由总厂统筹购发，使总厂能掌握全面情况，灵活调拨各厂存料，并减少购料人员，节省购料费用，后因原料供应不能灵活运用，经过该厂九月二十日行政工作会议的检讨，认为原料不能灵活供应的原因是：（一）生产任务系按顾主需要而定，筹料是根据订货而临时采购。应什么活买什么料，拿着定金去买。（二）流动资金不足，不能购存一定备用的材料。该厂前身又是修械所，储存的材料多不适用，又不充分。（三）旧的制度废除了，新的制度还不健全，业务也不熟悉，对材料卡片、预决算书，材料库帐等等都是新事物，还不能灵活运用。（四）采购人员都是提升的工人，业务还不熟悉。小的附属材料较零星，更难及时供应。针对这些缺点，根据生产任务、材料储量、人力、制度贯彻程度等实际情况，修正了采购办法，总厂和分厂分工，主要的、大批的和北京买不到的材料，由总厂统一采购，一般的副料经总厂批准后，分厂可自购。由总厂器材科和工务科明确规定总厂供给和分厂自购的品名，器材科经常准备一个月消耗量的材料，分厂备有相当数额的流动资金，临时需用的副料，可随用随购，不必造预算。总厂交下生产任务时，如主料不能及时发下，则在命令单上注明何时来料。自修正办法实行以来，虽然由于工作人员对新制度的不够熟悉，分厂、总厂的联系有时还要因手续不合而耽搁，但在材料供应方面，已较前灵活得多。现在所存在的基本困难是没有足够的周转金，和生产任务不固定，例如这次做给煤机，下次又做水鹤和螺丝，不能主动的购存材料。这两个问题解决以后，预算制度和统筹采购就可以大大减少分厂的麻烦，促进生产效率。
