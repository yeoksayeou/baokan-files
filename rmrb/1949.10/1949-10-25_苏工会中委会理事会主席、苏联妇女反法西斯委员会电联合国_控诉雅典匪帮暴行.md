Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 22nd (TASS): Kuznetsov, Chairman of the Central Council of All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, and the Soviet Women's Anti-Fascist Committee, respectively, sent cables to UN Secretary-General Lie and UN General Assembly President Romulo, protesting against the death sentences imposed on Greek patriots by the Athens royalist fascists, stating: Millions of working people and Soviet women in the Soviet Union are extremely indignant upon learning of the new crimes of the Greek royalist fascist regime. The Athens military court's death sentences on eight innocent Greek democrats, namely: Taragani, Muratidis, Silagis, Aeonidis, Barbunakis, Iliopoulos, Famiris, and Strelakos, are an illegal and arbitrary expression of judgment against Greek patriots and heroes of the anti-Hitler aggressor resistance movement.

The All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions and the Soviet Women's Anti-Fascist Committee, representing millions of Soviet working people and Soviet women, protest against this continuous bloody terror by the Greek royalist fascists and call on the UN General Assembly to take urgent measures to stop this despicable murder, and demand that the Greek government stop using barbaric torture and abuse against political prisoners.

Prior to this, the relatives of the Greek patriots who had been sentenced to death had written to Marshal Stalin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, recounting the experiences of the Greek patriots. Fascist executioners had tightly twisted the genitals of the defendants to extract confessions during interrogation, female prisoners were beaten naked and subjected to fire torture, and some had died or gone insane due to torture. The letter stated that death sentences were being announced one after another, and if the United Nations did not take action, more people would die. The letter urged Stalin to do everything possible to save them.

　　苏工会中委会理事会主席、苏联妇女反法西斯委员会电联合国
    控诉雅典匪帮暴行
    【新华社北京二十四日电】据塔斯社莫斯科二十二日讯：全苏工会中央理事会主席库兹涅佐夫和苏联妇女反法西斯委员会顷分别致电联合国秘书长莱氏及联合国大会主席罗慕洛，抗议雅典保皇法西斯判处希腊爱国者死刑称：苏联千百万劳动人民和苏联妇女，获悉希腊保皇法西斯政权的新罪行后，愤慨万分。雅典军事法庭对八位无辜的希腊民主分子，即：塔拉甘尼，穆拉梯迪斯，西拉吉斯，埃昂尼迪斯，巴尔布纳基斯，伊利奥波洛斯，法米里斯，斯特列拉科斯判处死刑，是表示对希腊爱国者、对反希特勒侵略匪徒之抵抗运动英雄的不法的裁判上的专断。
    全苏工会中央理事会和苏联妇女反法西斯委员会代表千百万苏联劳动人民和苏联妇女，声言抗议希腊保皇法西斯分子这种不间断的血腥恐怖，并呼吁联合国大会采取紧急措施，以制止这可鄙的谋杀，并要求希腊政府停止对政治犯施用野蛮的酷刑与虐待。
    在此之前，被判死刑的希腊爱国者的亲属曾致函苏联部长会议主席斯大林大元帅，历述希腊爱国者的遭遇，法西斯施刑人逼供时曾紧压绞扭被告的生殖器官，女犯被赤身拷打，且施以火刑，有些已因酷刑致死或已疯狂。该函称死刑的判决接连发表，如果联合国不采取行动，则将有更多的人死亡。该函吁请斯大林尽一切可能拯救他们。
