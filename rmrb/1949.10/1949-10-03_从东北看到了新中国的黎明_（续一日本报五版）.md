Seeing the Dawn of New China from the Northeast
    (Continued from Page 5 of This Newspaper)
    We saw two twelve-year-old children from poor peasant families in the juvenile art troupe, playing the violin and touching the musical score. These children, if in the past, would only have had the opportunity to be beasts of burden for landlords and wealthy families, farming and herding sheep, or picking up cow dung and collecting coal cinders. But now, they even have the opportunity to touch the creations of world geniuses and play beautiful sounds.
    We saw a five-year-old child dancing to the song "Our Motherland" at a grand gathering. He raised his little feet and waved his little hands. From his rhythmic movements, we could experience the active minds of this generation of children.
    Also, in the theater, in mass gatherings, the songs of the youth overflow with revolutionary enthusiasm. This is a revolutionary torrent, and whoever walks into it will be melted inside.
    This is the beginning of a new era, and this era itself is pregnant with countless singers. Isn't this democracy? Otherwise, why is it that even the "pig herder," who was always looked down upon by the rich, can now play the violin?

    　　　　※※　　　　　　　　　　※※　　　　　　　　　※※
    Let's talk about Sino-Soviet relations. No matter how the imperialists and the Kuomintang bandits make malicious propaganda, we have seen many moving facts in the Lushun-Dalian area.
    In the past, during the Japanese imperialist rule, the Chinese only had the opportunity to eat acorn flour. Eating rice was a crime, and even vomited rice grains could become evidence for Japanese military police to arrest people. Chinese people had the freedom to be dragged into the army as coolies and the obligation to not know their own motherland. Although there were universities, Chinese people rarely had the opportunity to enter them. In elementary schools, children were not allowed to speak Chinese. But in 1945, the Soviet army came, and now, in just four short years, the entire situation in Lushun-Dalian has completely changed.
    In the past, there was a grain shortage for five months every year, but now it is able to barely be self-sufficient, and the workers no longer eat acorn flour. The streets are quiet and there are few pedestrians. All the labor force has been absorbed into the factories. Every district has a cultural station, and the movement to eliminate illiteracy is underway. Workers have "Workers' Homes" and are stepping up their studies of technology, politics, and culture.
    The close friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people is not accidental.
    Soviet soldiers treat Chinese workers as their own brothers, shaking their greasy hands.
    The Soviet army took out its own war horses to help the farmers cultivate the land. The Soviet army, carrying guns, ran into the mountains with the Chinese farmers to kill the wolves that were harming them.
    Soviet soldiers bravely jumped into the water to rescue Chinese compatriots who were about to drown.
    Soviet doctors drew their own blood to transfuse to Chinese patients.
    Soviet friends preserved Dalian University and are now handing it over to us. They have supplied us with many instruments, enabling it to be rebuilt quickly.
    In Sino-Soviet joint ventures, the first thing that is paid attention to is the safety equipment for workers in the production process, to prevent accidents from happening.
    In private conversations, Soviet friends all expressed sincerity, frankness, and humility, and expressed sincere expectations for the future of Chinese industry.
    The facts are like this, and all the rumors have become nonsense.
    Yes, we love our people, our homeland, our language, and we have national self-esteem, but we oppose national chauvinism and narrow nationalism. We oppose the isolationist mentality of closing the door to the outside world. We welcome the goodwill support of socialist countries and new democratic countries for us, and we trust even more the sincerity of Marxist-Leninist internationalism. The people's patriotism is to enable the broad masses of the people to improve their lives and improve their culture. Only reactionaries raise the banner of "nationalism" to actually sell out the interests of the Chinese people.
    Yes, in the Lushun-Dalian area, we have seen the future vision of more friendly cooperation between the two nations of China and the Soviet Union.

    　　　　※※　　　　　　　　　　　※※　　　　　　　　※※
    Let's reflect on ourselves. Having seen so many things, what have we ourselves gained spiritually? Yes, after this trip, our souls have been purified.
    "Labor creates the world" is a slogan we often see, but this time we have really seen the living facts and experienced this truth.
    We saw coal miners with lamps hanging on their heads, covered in mud, digging hard in the darkness 300 meters below the ground, mining underground treasures.
    We saw workers beside the shipyard, sitting on tower-high cranes, hanging thousands of pounds of iron bars in the air, like a child playing with paper toys with threads.
    We saw electric steel cones knocking huge rocks into pieces, and then grinding them into powder with a rotor.
    We saw a furnace with a high heat of more than 1,400 degrees, burning iron into a bright red solution.
    When the iron was released, the red iron juice flowed out of the trough like a small river. The whistle was blowing, the water was spraying mist, and the sparks were jumping. What a great scene it was.
    When the huge red-hot steel ingot was thrown on the rolling mill, rolling around, slowly cooled by the splashing water, and rolled into long strips, what a moving scene it was.
    When the red-hot small iron bars were as soft as red ropes, wrapped around the workers, what a beautiful scene it was.
    In the eyes of the workers, there is no difficulty in the world. The hardest iron and stone can be broken into pieces, melted into a solution, and cast into various shapes according to people's will.
    Having seen these things, can we not deeply feel the greatness of modern industry and the strength of the proletariat?
    Indeed, when we stand in front of the huge water tower and the suspended crane, we feel that we are small. When we stand in front of the complex generator and the intricate iron pipes, we realize our own ignorance. When we see the workers working hard silently and the finished products they produce every day, we feel that our work is too superficial. When we see the labor heroes happily rolling up their sleeves, working together to create social wealth, we feel that our selfish plans and worries about reputation and status are too humble.
    It is not God, but the collective strength of the laborers that has completed the huge and complex projects of modern industry. Without them, all civilization would lose its foundation, and human life would become very poor and desolate. It is they who have given us so much wealth, and it is they who are the real masters of society.
    Yes, today should be the time for us to transform ourselves and embrace the working class. Can we still wallow in the slave mentality of the exploiters? Can we still be satisfied with the leisurely mood of parasitic life? Can we still indulge in the illusions of decadent enjoyment? Can we still remain indifferent and ignorant of these laboring masses forever? No, art serving the workers is a glorious thing. Describing them and praising them is a thing to be proud of. And for art itself, serving the workers and serving humanity is also a kind of liberation. The land has been turned over, and the sky has dawned. Let us sing for the real masters of society.
    Finally, we want to thank the Northeast. It has given us many inspirations. It has told us the vision of the future new China and has enabled us to wash away many remnants of the old era and add a lot of fresh blood.

　　从东北看到了新中国的黎明
   　（续一日本报五版）
    我们看见了少年艺术队里两个出身于贫农家里的十二岁的小孩子，他们拉着小提琴，摸着五线谱。这些孩子们，假使在从前只可能有机会替地主豪门当牛马，种地牧羊，或者是拾牛粪、检煤屑，可是现在，他们竟然也有机会来手触世界天才的制作，演奏出美妙的声音。
    我们看见了一个五岁的小孩子，在一个盛大的会场上，随着“我们的祖国”的歌声，跳起舞来，他腾起了小小的脚，扬起了小小的手，从他的有节奏的动作里面，我们可以体验到这一辈小孩子们的活跃的心灵。
    还有在戏院里面，在群众集会的场所里面，青年们的歌声洋溢着革命的热情，这里是革命的洪流，谁走进去，谁就会给溶化在里面。
    这是新时代的开创，这时代的本身正孕育着无量的歌手。这不是民主吗？不然为什么一向被有钱人看不起的“牧猪奴”，今天也能够拉起小提琴来呢？
    　　　　※※　　　　　　　　　　※※　　　　　　　　　※※
    再就中苏关系来说吧。不管帝国主义、国民党匪帮，怎样作着恶意的宣传，可是我们在旅大地区可看见了许多动人的事实。
    过去日本帝国主义统治时代，中国人只有吃橡子面的机会，吃大米饭就是犯罪，连呕吐出来的饭粒，都可以成为日本宪兵抓人的证据。中国人有被拉去当兵当苦力的自由，有不知道自己祖国的义务。大学虽然有，但中国人却很少有进去的机会。小学校里，孩子们不准讲中国话。可是一九四五年苏军来了，到了现在只短短的四年，旅大的整个情形已完全变了。
    过去是每年都缺五个月的粮，可是现在已经能够勉强自给自足，工人们不再吃橡子面了。大街上冷静静的很少看得见行人，所有的劳动力都被吸收到工厂里去了。每一个区都有文化站，扫除文盲运动正在展开。工人们有“工人之家”，正在加紧学习技术、政治和文化。
    中苏人民间的亲密的友谊是并不是偶然的。
    苏军的士兵们，把中国的工人们，看作自己的弟兄一样，向他们油腻的手握手。
    苏军把自己的战马拿出来，帮助农民耕田，苏军挂着枪和中国的农民一道，跑进山里去，打杀为害的山狼。
    苏军勇敢的跳进水里去，抢救快要淹死的中国同胞。
    苏联的医生把自己的血抽出来，向中国病人输血。
    苏联朋友们保存了大连大学，现在又把它移交过来。供给了我们许多仪器，使得它得以迅速重建。
    在中苏合办的工厂里，首先注意的就是在生产过程中工人们的安全设备，防止意外事件的发生。
    苏联朋友们在私人谈话中，莫不表露诚恳、坦白、谦虚，对中国工业的前途表示殷切的期待。
    事实是如此，一切的谣言都变成了无稽。
    是的，我们爱我们的人民，我们的乡土，我们的语言，我们有民族的自尊，可是我们反对民族的自大主义和狭隘的民族主义，我们反对关起大门来的排外思想；我们欢迎社会主义国家和新民主主义国家对我们的善意的支持，我们更信赖马列主义者的国际主义的诚意。人民的爱国主义是要使广大的人民生活能够改善，文化能够提高，只有反动派才爱抬出“民族主义”的招牌，来实际出卖中国人民的利益。
    是的，在旅大区，我们已看到了中苏两国民族更友好合作的未来的远景。
    　　　　※※　　　　　　　　　　　※※　　　　　　　　※※
    让我们自己反省一下吧，看见了这许多东西，究竟我们自己精神上也增加了一些什么呢？是的，经过了这一次的旅行，我们的灵魂已获得了一次净化。
    “劳动创造世界”，这是我们所常见的标语，可是这次我们可真的看见了活生生的事实，并体验到这个真理了。
    我们看见了头上挂着灯的煤矿工人，满身泥污在三百米下的黑暗中艰辛地挖着地下的宝藏。
    我们看见了船坞旁边、坐在塔一般高的吊车上的工人，把几千斤的铁条吊在空中，象一个小孩子用提线玩弄着纸糊的玩具。
    我们看见了电动的钢锥，把巨大的岩石，敲成碎片，然后又用旋筒把它磨成粉末。
    我们看见了一千四百多度的高热的熔炉，把铁烧成鲜红的溶液。
    出铁的时候，红色的铁汁象小河般从槽子里流了出来，汽笛在鸣，水在喷着雾，火花在跳跃，那场面是多么伟大呀。
    当烧得通红的巨大的钢块，被抛在碾床上，滚来滚去，慢慢的被水花冷却，碾成长条的时候，那场面是多么动人呀。
    当烧红了的小铁条，象红色的绳子般那么柔软，围绕在工人的身边的时候，那场面是多么的美丽呀。
    在工人看来，世界上没有什么困难，最坚硬的铁石，也可以敲成碎片，熔成溶液，按照着人们的意志，铸造出各种各样的型体。
    看过了这些东西，我们能够不深深地感到近代工业的伟大和无产阶级的力量吗？
    的确，当我们站在巨大的水塔面前、悬空的吊车面前，我们是感觉得自己渺小了。当我们站在复杂的发电机面前，千头万绪回旋曲折的铁管面前，我们是认识到自己的无知了。当我们看见工人们一声不响地艰辛劳作，和他们每天出产的成品，我们是感觉觉到自己的工作太虚浮了。当我们看见劳动英雄们一个个兴高采烈地卷起袖子，在共同为创造社会财富而努力的时候，我们就感到自己自私的打算和担心名誉地位的筹谋太过卑下了。
    不是神，而是劳动者的集体力量，才完成了近代工业的巨大的和复杂的工程。没有他们，一切文明都会失去了基础，人类的生活将变得十分贫乏和荒凉。是他们给了我们这样多的财富，是他们才是社会的真正的主人。
    是的，今天应该是我们改造自己和工人阶级拥抱的时候了。我们还能够自甘堕落于剥削者的奴隶思想的池沼里吗？我们还能够自满于寄生生活者的悠闲的情调吗？我们还能够沉迷于颓废享乐的幻梦中吗？我们还能够对于这些劳苦大众永远表示冷淡和无知吗？不，艺术为劳动者服务，这是一件光荣的事情，描写他们，歌颂他们，这是一件值得夸耀的事情。而且就艺术本身来说，为劳动者服务，为人类服务，这也是一种解放。土地翻身，天已经黎明，让我们为真正的社会主人而歌吧。
    末了，我们要感谢东北，它给予了我们以很多的启示，它告诉了我们未来的新中国的远景，并使我们自己涤除了好些旧时代的残渣和增加了许多新鲜的血液。
