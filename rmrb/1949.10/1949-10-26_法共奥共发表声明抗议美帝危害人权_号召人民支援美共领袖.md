　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 25th: TASS, Paris, October 24th: The Central Committee of the French Communist Party issued a protest against the U.S. court's shameful verdict against the leaders of the U.S. Communist Party, stating: "The Central Committee of the French Communist Party angrily protests this fascist-like trial, in which eleven leaders of the U.S. Communist Party were convicted for their ideological views. The Central Committee expresses its warm sympathy to Comrades Dennis, Davis, Gates, Green, Hall, Potash, Stacher, Thompson, Williamson, Winston, Winter, and proclaims the support of French Communists and democrats for them. They admire the courage of the U.S. Communist leaders in defending freedom and peace. The Central Committee also calls on all French people loyal to the creed of human rights to unite and expose the injustice and illegality of U.S. imperialism. This behavior of U.S. imperialism is demonstrating to the governments under its command, allowing them to follow the path of suppressing labor and democratic movements in order to prepare for a new war."
　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 25th: TASS, Vienna: The Austrian people expressed extreme indignation at the "conviction" of the leaders of the Communist Party of the United States. The Central Committee of the Austrian Communist Party sent a telegram to Foster, chairman of the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States, expressing their solidarity in their struggle against the class justice atrocities of the American plutocrats. The telegram stated: We see the "convicted" leaders of the American Communist Party as the best fighters of the American people for peace, democracy and freedom. In this shameful verdict, the imperialists exposed their true colors, and at the same time made the opinion of all upright people more convinced of the need to strengthen the struggle against imperialism and fascism.
　　The Austrian newspaper Volksstimme emphasized that the verdict of the U.S. court was based on the testimony of detectives, spies, and provocateurs, and was carried out in an atmosphere of war psychosis. Even in the trial of the German Reichstag fire, Hitler's witnesses and judges were not as shameless as the judges of "free" America. The so-called American "democracy," which has been greatly touted, has finally revealed its ugly face. The verdict announced by the U.S. court shows a plot against peace and reflects the great fear felt by the financial oligarchs of the invincible power of socialism.

　　法共奥共发表声明抗议美帝危害人权　
    号召人民支援美共领袖
    【新华社北京二十五日电】塔斯社巴黎二十四日讯：法国共产党中央委员会为美国法庭对美共领袖的可耻判决，发表抗议称：“法国共产党中央委员会愤怒地抗议这种法西斯式的审判，使美共领袖十一人因他们的思想见解而被判有罪。中央委员会特向但尼斯、戴维斯、盖兹、格林、贺尔、鲍塔许、史塔彻、汤普森、威廉姆森、温斯顿、温脱等同志，表示热烈的同情，并宣告法国共产党人及民主分子对他们的支援，他们赞慕美共领袖们此种保卫自由与和平的勇气。中央委员会并号召所有忠于人权信条的法国人团结起来，揭发美国帝国主义此种不公平与不合法的行为。美国帝国主义的这种行为，是向其指挥下的各国政府示范，让它们遵循镇压劳工与民主运动的道路，以准备新的战争”。
    【新华社北京二十五日电】塔斯社维也纳讯：奥地利人民对美国共产党领袖的被“判罪”表示极端愤慨。奥地利共产党中央委员会致电美国共产党全国委员会主席福斯特，对于他们反抗美国巨万富翁的阶级司法的暴行的斗争，表示休戚与共。该电称：我们看到被“判罪”的美国共产党领袖们是美国人民争取和平、民主及自由的最优秀的斗士。在这次可耻的判决中，帝国主义者暴露了他们自己的真面目，同时使一切正直的人民的舆论，更加深信有加强反对帝国主义及法西斯主义的斗争的必要。
    奥地利人民舆论报强调称：美国法庭的宣判系基于警探特务及挑拨者的作证，并且是在一种战争心理的气氛中进行的。甚至德国国会纵火案的审讯中，希特勒的证人和法官，也不及“自由”美国的法官那样厚颜无耻。被大大吹嘘的所谓美国式“民主”终于揭露了自己丑恶的面目。美国法庭所宣布的判决，显示了反对和平的图谋，并且反映了金融寡头们对社会主义不可征服的力量所感觉到的极大恐惧。
