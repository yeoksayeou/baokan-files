        (1) Greetings to the German People
    The Chinese people are celebrating with great joy the establishment of the provisional government of the German Democratic Republic headed by Wilhelm Pieck. This is a major victory and contribution of the German people in their struggle for the peaceful and democratic unification of Germany and the defense of world peace. This is a historic achievement that represents the national interests of the entire German people and conforms to the common aspirations of the people of the world.
    The people of the world, like the people of all Germany, have long been unable to tolerate the policy of the American and British imperialists to split Germany. In the West German occupied areas under the instigation and control of American and British warmongers, not only has Hitler's militarism not been eliminated, and war institutions not been destroyed, but the Western occupying powers are frantically strengthening war measures, and are basely deceiving the German people in an attempt to once again use them as tools for imperialist aggression. Reactionary groups are strangling the German people's economy, bringing deep national disasters to the German people. This situation cannot but arouse the national indignation of the entire German people, and actively unite the democratic forces within the country to fight for the realization of a unified, peaceful, and democratic country, and resolutely lean towards the Soviet-led camp of peace and democracy in the international arena, and smash the evil plans of the American and British imperialist warmongers to dismember Germany and instigate war.
    The Chinese people, like other peace-loving people in the world, have always believed that the German question must be completely and reasonably resolved. We fully agree with the Soviet government's consistent position and attitude on the German question, which is to unswervingly adhere to the principled position of the Potsdam Agreement, oppose all reactionary attempts to deviate from the principles of the Potsdam Resolution on the German question; restore a peaceful, democratic, and unified Germany, oppose the division of Germany, and prepare for and conclude a peace treaty with Germany in accordance with the Potsdam principles. People still remember that as early as the Potsdam Conference, Stalin suggested that Germany must immediately establish a provisional central government. Since then, whether at the Moscow Conference or at successive foreign ministers' meetings, the Soviet Union has resolutely supported the German people's struggle to establish a unified democratic republic. Although all these efforts have been opposed and undermined by the American and British imperialist blocs, and even more so in May of this year, when the American, British, and French imperialists intensified their actions by approving the so-called West German constitution, dismembering and dividing Germany. However, the Soviet peace government, as Pieck praised, "makes the idea of establishing a unified Germany and maintaining peace accepted by more and more people around the world," forming a huge force. The American, British, and French imperialists' attempt to turn Germany into a springboard for a new war of aggression and to revive fascist reactionary policies has been unanimously condemned and rejected by the German people, the people of the United States, Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, and other countries, as well as by all peace-loving people around the world. The Soviet policy greatly encouraged the German people's courage to move forward, striving to rebuild their motherland in accordance with democratic and peaceful principles! Their unanimous call is "to take their destiny into their own hands." People's congress movements have been launched throughout Germany, and even in the Western occupied areas, people's democratic movements have erupted, unanimously supporting the establishment of an all-German democratic government and opposing the division of Germany. With the strength of unity and cooperation of the people of East Germany, extensively unite the people of all strata in West Germany, which forms a broad national united front. On the basis of this united front, the German People's Council has the full possibility to formulate the constitution of the German Democratic Republic and establish the provisional government of the German Democratic Republic according to the will of the German people.
    Now the Soviet government has declared that it will transfer the administrative powers belonging to the Soviet military government to the government of the German Democratic Republic and announced the abolition of the Soviet military government, which once again fully proves that the Soviet policy is completely contrary to the policy of the Western imperialist bloc. The Soviet Union treats the German people as brothers, without any selfishness or self-interest. Everything is for the convenience of Germany's democratization, the development of cooperation and mutual assistance between people's democratic countries and the German people, in order to jointly safeguard world peace. As the German Socialist Unity Party said in a recent declaration: "The Soviet Union has proven that it will be the only defender of a unified Germany and the only friend of millions of working people who are willing to live in peace."
    The Chinese people warmly congratulate the German people who have won a great victory through heroic struggle. We believe that in the future common struggle of the people of the world to defend world peace, oppose imperialist aggression, and new war conspiracies, the Chinese and German people will closely join hands, and the relationship between China and Germany will also enter a new stage from now on.
    　　　　(2) Welcome the Delegation of the World Federation of Trade Unions and the Delegation of the Women's International Democratic Federation
    Since learning in February this year that the Asian Trade Union Representatives Conference and the Asian Women Representatives Conference had decided to be held in China, the Chinese people have been eagerly looking forward to the arrival of the brothers and sisters from various countries who will participate in these two conferences. Now, before the opening of the conference, the delegation of the World Federation of Trade Unions and the representatives of the Women's International Democratic Federation have rushed to participate in the preparatory work of the two conferences and arrived in Beijing together. We express a warm welcome with excitement and joy.
    When the World Federation of Trade Unions Congress was held in Milan in June and July this year, the Italian reactionary government refused to issue entry permits to the trade union delegations from China and several other Asian countries, in an attempt to undermine the unity of Chinese workers, Asian workers, and the world working class, and to hinder the victorious advance of the common cause of the world working class. Facts have long proved how absurd and stupid this measure by the Gasperi reactionary government was. At that time, the report on the Asian trade union movement made by Liu Ningyi, Vice Chairman of the World Federation of Trade Unions, was still brought to the conference and read to the representatives of workers from all over the world. The unity of Asian workers and world workers cannot be undermined by anyone. Now, the representatives of more than 70 million organized workers around the world—the delegation of the World Federation of Trade Unions—have come to Beijing to participate in the preparatory work for the Asian-Australian Trade Union Representatives Conference. Who else can prevent them from shaking hands with the Chinese workers?
    Last year, the Nehru government, the running dog of imperialism in India, prevented the Asian Women Representatives Conference from being held in Calcutta. They wanted to undermine the unity of Asian women and suppress the struggle of women in various Asian countries for peace, democracy, and their own liberation. Facts have repeatedly proven how foolish this calculation by imperialism and its lackeys is. The Asian Women Representatives Conference will soon open in the capital of New China. Who can prevent the successful convening of this conference? The representatives of more than 88 million organized women from 54 countries—the representatives of the Women's International Democratic Federation—have come to participate in the preparatory work for the conference, which will surely make the preparations for the conference more complete. Women throughout Asia will unite more firmly around the Women's International Democratic Federation and their advanced Soviet sisters, and fight more strongly for national independence, world peace, and their own liberation.
    Now, less than ten months have passed since the decision was made to hold the two conferences in China, and earth-shaking changes have taken place in the East. The Chinese people have stood up, the Chinese workers have stood up, and the Chinese women have stood up! We are no longer oppressed by reactionary forces at home and abroad. We have established our own new country. Today, we are especially happy to be able to welcome the delegation of the World Federation of Trade Unions and the representatives of the Women's International Democratic Federation in Beijing, the capital of New China. We will always remember that the World Federation of Trade Unions and the Women's International Democratic Federation have done their best to help the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle. The victory of the Chinese people is inseparable from the help of international friends. Chinese workers and women will certainly follow Chairman Mao's call to "unite international friends," work with international friends, do a good job in preparing for the two important conferences, and make the two conferences a success!

　　社论
        （一）向德国人民致贺
    中国人民以极大的喜悦庆贺以威廉·皮克为首的德意志民主共和国临时政府的成立。这是德国人民在争取德意志和平民主统一及保卫世界和平的斗争中的一个重大胜利和贡献，这是代表着全德人民的民族利益并符合于全世界人民共同愿望的历史性的成就。
    全世界人民，和全德意志的人民一样，早就不能容忍美英帝国主义分裂德国的政策。在美英战争贩子们的策动与支配下的西德占领区，不但希特拉的军国主义没有消除，战争机构没有摧毁，而且西方占领国家反倒在狂疯地加强着战争措施，卑鄙地欺骗德国人民企图再度利用他们作为帝国主义侵略的工具，反动集团正在绞杀德国人民经济，给德国人民带来了深重的民族灾难。这种情况，不能不激起全德人民的民族义愤，而积极团结其国内的民主力量，为实现一个统一的和平民主的国家而斗争，并在国际上坚决倒向以苏联为首的和平民主阵营，粉碎美英帝国主义战争贩子肢解德国和鼓动战争的罪恶计划。
    中国人民象世界其他爱好和平的人民一样，始终认为德国问题必须予以完全合理的解决。我们完全赞同苏联政府对于德国问题的一贯的立场和态度，这便是坚持不渝地遵守波茨坦协定的原则立场，反对在德国问题上离开波茨坦决议原则的一切反动企图；恢复一个和平民主统一的德国，反对分裂德国，并根据波茨坦原则准备和缔结对德和约。人们都还记得，远在波茨坦会议的时候，斯大林即曾建议德国必须立即建立一个临时中央政府。此后，无论在莫斯科会议上，在历次外长会议上，苏联都坚决地支持德国人民为建立统一的民主共和国的斗争。虽然这一切努力均曾遭到美英帝国主义集团的反对和破坏，甚至到了今年五月美、英、法帝国主义却更变本加厉地批准所谓西德宪法，肢解和分裂德国。可是苏联的和平政府，正如皮克所称赞的，“使建立统一的德国与维持和平的这一思想，为全世界越来越多的人所接受”，形成了巨大的力量。而美英法帝国主义企图将德国变成新的侵略战争的跳板，复活法西斯的反动政策则受到德国人民和美、英、法、比、荷、丹等国人民以及全世界爱好和平人民一致愤怒的谴责和唾弃。苏联的政策，大大鼓舞了德国人民前进的勇气，努力按照民主与和平原则重建自己的祖国！他们一致的呼声是“把命运掌握在自己手里”，全德各地发动了人民代表大会运动，即便在西方占领区也爆发了人民民主运动，一致支持建立一个全德民主政府，反对德国的分裂。以东德人民团结合作的力量，广泛地团结西德各阶层人民，这就形成一个广泛的民族统一战线，而在这个统一战线的基础上德国人民委员会就有了充分可能，根据德国人民的意志，制定了德意志民主共和国宪法，成立了德意志民主共和国临时政府。
    现在苏联政府业已声明把属于苏联军政府的行政职权移交给德意志民主共和国政府，并宣布苏军政府的取消，这再一次充分地证明了苏联的政策跟西方帝国主义集团政策完全相反，苏联对于德国人民完全是以兄弟相待的，他毫无一点私心私利，一切都是为了便利于德国的民主化，发展人民民主国家同德国人民之间的合作、互助，以便共同保障世界和平。诚如德国统一社会党最近一次宣言中所说：“苏联已证明将是统一的德国的唯一的保卫者，是千百万愿意和平生活的劳动人民的唯一的朋友。”
    中国人民热烈地向英勇斗争取得了伟大胜利的德国人民致贺，我们相信在今后全世界人民为保卫世界和平、反对帝国主义侵略和新战争阴谋的共同斗争中，中德两国人民将亲密地携起手来，中德两国关系从此也将踏入一个新的阶段。
    　　　　（二）欢迎世界工联代表团和国际民主妇联代表
    自从今年二月间知道了亚洲职工会代表会议和亚洲妇女代表会议决定在中国召开的消息之后，中国人民就一直翘首企望着要参加这两个会议的各国兄弟姊妹们的来临。现在，在会议开幕之前，世界工联代表团和国际民主妇联代表已赶来参加两个会议的筹备工作，同车抵达北京，我们以满怀的兴奋和愉快，表示热烈地欢迎。
    今年六、七月间，世界工联代表大会在米兰召开的时候，意大利反动政府曾拒绝签发中国和亚洲其他几个国家的职工代表团的入境证，想以此破坏中国工人、亚洲工人和世界工人阶级的团结，阻挡世界工人阶级共同事业的胜利前进。事实早已证明了，加斯贝利反动政府这种措施是多么荒谬而又愚蠢。就在当时，世界工联副主席刘宁一所作关于亚洲职工运动的报告还是带到大会上向世界各国工人的代表宣读了，亚洲工人和世界工人的团结，是谁也破坏不了的。现在，全世界七千多万有组织的工人的代表——世界工联代表团到北京来参加亚澳职工会代表会议的筹备工作了，还有谁能阻止他们和中国工人握手呢？
    在去年，帝国主义在印度的走狗尼赫鲁政府曾阻止了亚洲妇女代表会议在加尔各答召开，他们想以此破坏亚洲妇女的团结，抑制亚洲各国妇女为和平民主与自身解放所进行的斗争。帝国主义及其走卒们这种打算是如何愚蠢，也一再地为事实所证明。亚洲妇女代表会议不久就要在新中国的首都开幕了，谁还能阻止这个会议的胜利召开呢？五十四国八千多万有组织的妇女的代表——国民际主妇联代表已来参加会议的筹备工作了，这一定会使会议准备得更为圆满，全亚洲的妇女都要在国际民主妇联和苏联先进的姐妹们的周围更巩固地团结起来，更坚强地为民族独立、世界和平与自身的解放而斗争。
    现在离决定两个会议在中国召开那个时候，不到十个月，而在世界的东方已发生了翻天覆地的大变化，中国人民站立起来了，中国工人站立起来了，中国妇女站立起来了！我们再也不受国内外反动势力的欺压，我们已建立了自己的新国家，今天，能在新中国的首都北京欢迎世界工联代表团和国际民主妇联代表，我们特别觉得高兴。我们永远记得，世界工联和国际民主妇联都曾尽力援助中国人民的革命斗争，中国人民的胜利是和国际友人的援助分不开的；中国工人和妇女一定会遵照毛主席“团结国际友人”的号召，和国际友人在一起，把两个有重大意义的会议的筹备工作做好，把两个大会开好！
