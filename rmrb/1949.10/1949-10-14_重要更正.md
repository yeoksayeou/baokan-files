　　Important Correction
    In the news article "Beijing Suburban Committee Deploys Land Reform in Suburban Areas" on page four of this newspaper on the 13th, the "six" in the last sentence, "It is estimated that it will be fully completed by the end of June next year," is a mistake for "two."
    Also, in the news article "Establishment of the Industry Bureau and Commerce Bureau" on the 12th, "Ma Yingzhong is the Deputy Director of the Tax Bureau of the Beijing Municipal People's Government" should read "Ying Ma Zhong." We hereby issue these corrections.

　　重要更正
    十三日本报四版“京市郊委布置郊区土地改革”新闻内，末段“估计至明年六月底，即可全部完成”一语中之“六”字系“二”之误。
    又十二日“工业局商业局成立”新闻内，末段“马应中为北京市人民政府税务司副局长”中之“马应中”误为“应马中”。特此一并更正。
