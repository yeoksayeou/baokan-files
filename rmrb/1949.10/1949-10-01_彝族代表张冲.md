  　Yi Representative Zhang Chong
    Zhang Chong arrived in Yan'an in 1946 from Yunnan, ostensibly to attend the bogus National Assembly, taking advantage of the opportunity. He told reporters that in his early years, due to his hatred of national discrimination and oppression, and lacking correct leadership, he had taken to life as a bandit. After the founding of the Republic of China, he was reorganized into the Yunnan regular army, rising from battalion commander, regimental commander, division commander, army commander to commander-in-chief, gradually embarking on the path of warlordism, betraying the interests of his laboring brothers, and becoming an accomplice of the ruling class. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he opposed the Kuomintang's reactionary anti-communist policies, advocated unity against Japan, and believed that the heroic Eighth Route Army should be rewarded and treated equally. However, this basic demand for justice as a Chinese person was resented by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. He gradually saw through Chiang Kai-shek's gangster tactics and his true face of deceiving the people and selling out the country.
    Shortly after arriving in Yan'an, Zhang Chong transferred to the Northeast Liberated Area, where he served as a senior advisor to the Northeast People's Liberation Army and Deputy Chairman of the Songjiang People's Government. During this period, he had a lot of time to study, and seeing how the soldiers and civilians in the Liberated Areas worked hard to fight the enemy and carry out construction at the same time, and how the cadres at all levels were loyal, honest, and served the people, he saw the bright future of the Chinese Communist Party leading the Chinese people to victory. He threw himself back into the embrace of the people and felt boundless excitement and joy. In the past two or three years, he has gained dozens of pounds. He now deeply feels that he has done too little for the people. He said with passion: "Leaving the reactionary camp and arriving in the Liberated Area, I feel like I have crawled out of a stinking latrine, but I still have a lot of dirt on my body. I must study hard, wash and transform myself ideologically, and serve the people well."
    Regarding the Yi people, who have always been in backwardness and suffering, Zhang Chong said: The ruling class has never treated the Yi people as human beings throughout history, calling us "Luoluo" and "barbarians." The more the rulers oppressed us, the more backward the Yi people became. It can be said that we have been living an inhuman life. But this history has come to an end today and has changed. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party's Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, everyone treats ethnic minorities as brothers and sisters and helps them. This is the glory of ethnic minorities and the glory of all Chinese ethnic groups. If we Yi people want to be truly liberated, we must have the help of all fraternal ethnic groups. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, with the workers and peasants as the foundation, uniting all democratic classes and democratic parties, they will help us to stand up, progress, and develop, so as to achieve a large family of ethnic groups with friendship, cooperation, prosperity, and happiness. We Yi people resolutely oppose the enemy's instigation of discord. We must wage a life-and-death struggle against the enemy's conspiracies, whether they are foreign or domestic.

  　彝族代表张冲
    张冲是一九四六年自云南以出席伪国大为名，乘隙到达延安的。他向记者讲述道，早年因痛恨民族歧视的压迫，由于缺乏正确领导，因而曾走入了绿林生活。民国以后改编为云南正规军，由营长、团长、师长、军长而总指挥，逐渐走上军阀的道路，背叛了劳动兄弟们的利益，自己又作了统治阶级的帮凶。抗战期间他反对国民党反动的反共政策，主张团结抗日，对于英勇抗战的八路军他认为应该论功行赏，一视同仁，但这种一个中国人起码的正义要求亦为蒋匪所忌恨，他逐渐看出了蒋介石的流氓手段与欺民卖国的真面目。
    张冲到延安不久后即转赴东北解放区，曾任东北人民解放军高级参议，松江人民政府副主席。在这期间他有很多时间进行学习，看到解放区军民坚苦勤劳一面打击敌人，一面进行建设，各级干部忠诚、廉洁为人民服务的情形，他看到了中国共产党领导中国人民走向胜利的光明图景，他自己重新投入人民的怀抱，感到无限兴奋与快乐，两三年来他的身体竟增加了数十磅。他现在深感到自己为人民做事太少，他激情的说：“离开反动阵营到了解放区，我感到自己是从臭茅坑里爬出来了，但我身上所带的脏污还很多，我要努力学习，在思想上刷洗改造自己，好好的为人民服务。”
    对于一向处在落后与痛苦中的彝族人民，张冲说：统治阶级有史以来从未把彝族人民当人看待，称我们为猓猓、蛮子，统治者愈压迫，彝族人民就愈落后，可以说一直过着非人的生活。但是这种历史到今天结束了，改变了，在中国共产党马列主义毛泽东思想的领导下，大家把少数民族当成兄弟姊妹来帮助，这是少数民族的光荣，也是中国各兄弟民族的光荣。我们彝族人民要真正得到解放，必需有各兄弟民族的帮助，在共产党毛主席的领导下，以工农劳动人民为基础，团结各民主阶层，各民主党派，帮助我们翻身，进步，发展，以达到各民族友爱合作、繁荣幸福的大家庭。我们彝族人民坚决反对敌人的挑拨离间，不管是国外或国内敌人的阴谋，我们都要向其作生死的斗争。
