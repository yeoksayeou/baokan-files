Short Commentary

　　Seize the Time to Plow Once Over
　　Autumn harvesting and wheat planting have concluded in various parts of North China, and autumn plowing has generally begun. This is extremely important for improving agricultural production next year. Autumn plowing has many benefits: it can accumulate snow to nourish the land and prevent spring drought; loosen the soil and restore soil fertility; freeze insect eggs and reduce insect pests; remove weeds and bury manure; and fully absorb sunlight. Therefore, it is necessary to strive to complete the task of plowing once over before the ground freezes.
　　In some areas, because the leadership has tightly grasped the autumn plowing work, and the slogan of "plow as you harvest" has been effectively implemented, great achievements have been made. For example, over 50% of the land in the Chabei sub-district has been plowed, and most of the mountainous areas of Yanbei have been plowed. Other areas have also achieved considerable results. These are all worthy of commendation and learning. However, most areas are still far from completing the autumn plowing plan. Some have just started, and some have only plowed a small portion of the land. Some areas even exhibit lax leadership, lack of confidence, and a failure to earnestly solve various difficulties. These shortcomings must be quickly overcome.
　　Now that the Frost's Descent solar term has arrived, time is pressing. In order to complete the task of plowing once over, it is hoped that the following work will be carried out immediately in various places.
　　First, among the cadres, party members, and masses who have not yet been mobilized, continue to carry out mobilization. Explain to them the role of autumn plowing in improving production. The agricultural saying, "Autumn plowing one inch deep is worth a layer of manure," "Plow the land after autumn, and the land will be strong next year," and "One family does not autumn plow, and a thousand families suffer from insect pests" are truths proven by the production experience of the masses. In newly liberated areas, it is also necessary to promote the correct policies of "whoever harvests, plows; whoever plants, harvests," "the middle does not move, both ends are level," and protecting the fruits of labor. Use this to mobilize the enthusiasm of the peasant masses for autumn plowing, so that "the plow does not stop until the ground freezes," and "people, plows, and livestock are all busy," and strive to plow once over before the ground freezes.
　　Secondly, through the mass line, and completely based on the principles of voluntary and equivalent exchange, organize all manpower and animal power, and implement various methods such as mutual aid and exchange of labor, joint plowing, selling plows, borrowing plows, mutual assistance between people and livestock, and people pulling plows. Government and military units should mobilize cadres, provide livestock, and automatically help the masses with autumn plowing, overcome the difficulties of lacking manpower, animal power, and tools in autumn plowing, and resolutely oppose erroneous practices such as forced organization of mutual aid, forced setting of wages, forced joint plowing, and restricting the transportation and sale of livestock and not allowing livestock to leave the village.
　　We hope that the party and government leading organs in various places will organize autumn plowing inspection teams to go deep into various places to inspect and promote the work, solve various difficulties, exchange experiences from various places, organize competitions, and launch a surge of shock autumn plowing. We must also carry forward the past experience of substitute plowing to ensure that the land of revolutionary martyrs' families, military dependents, and workers' families is plowed once over.

### 抓紧时间普耕一遍

　　抓紧时间普耕一遍
    华北各地秋收种麦已经结束，秋耕已普遍开始，这对提高明年农业生产关系极大。秋耕的好处很多，它能积雪养地，防止春旱；疏松土壤，休息地力；冻死虫卵，减免虫灾；去除杂草，土埋沤粪；并能充分吸收阳光。因此，必须争取在地冻前完成普耕一遍的任务。
    有些地区，因为领导上对秋耕工作抓得紧，群众动手早，“随收随耕”的口号又切实有效，故已获得很大成绩。如察北分区已耕地百分之五十以上，雁北山地大部已耕完。其他地区也有不少成绩。这些都是值得表扬与学习的。但多数地区则距离完成秋耕的计划尚远，有的刚才开始，有的只耕了少部分土地。甚至某些地区还有放松领导、信心不高和没有认真解决各种困难的懈怠现象，这些是必须迅速加以克服的。
    现在霜降已至，时间紧迫，为了完成普耕一遍的任务，希望各地立即进行以下工作。
    首先要在尚未动员起来的干部党员与群众中，继续进行动员，要向他们说明秋耕对于提高生产的作用，农谚所谓“秋耕深一寸，顶上一层粪”，“秋后犁了地，明年地有劲”，“一家不秋耕，千家受虫害”，乃是群众生产经验所证明的真理。在新解放区还要宣传“谁收谁耕，谁种谁收”，“中间不动两头平”和保护劳动所得的正确政策，以此来发动农民群众秋耕的积极性，做到“地不冻，犁不停”，“人、犁、牲口三不闲”，全力争取在地冻以前普耕一遍。
    其次要经过群众路线，完全根据自愿等价的原则，把一切人力、畜力组织起来，实行互助换工、合犋、卖犋、借犋、人畜互助、人拉犁等各种方法。机关部队要动员干部，拿出牲口，自动帮助群众秋耕，克服秋耕中缺乏人力、畜力、工具等困难，坚决反对以强迫方式组织互助，强定工资、强迫合犋和限制牲口运销以及不许牲口出村等错误的作法。
    我们希望各地党政领导机关，要组织秋耕检查团，深入各地检查推动，解决各种困难，交流各地经验，组织竞赛，掀起突击秋耕的热潮。我们还必须发扬以往代耕的经验，保证把烈属、军属和工属的土地普耕一遍。
