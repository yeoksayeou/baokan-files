　　Completely Annihilate the Remnants of the Chiang-Bai Bandit Forces, Intensify Hard Training to Defend New China
    The Fourth Field Army and Other Units Resolve to Celebrate the Birth of New China with Practical Actions
    [Our Newspaper News] All commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Fourth Field Army and the Central China Military Region have been celebrating the birth of the People's Republic of China and actively preparing to welcome the International Day of Struggle for Peace in recent days. The large Yangko teams composed of units directly under the Field Army and the Military Region, after several days of rehearsal, held grand parades and demonstrations in Hankou and Wuchang on September 29 to show their celebration. The Field Army Political Propaganda Team, Dance Team, Military Band, Troops Art School, and more than a dozen troops' art groups have prepared a variety of literary and artistic activities for October 2nd - International Day of Struggle for Peace, such as living newspapers, lantern slides, operettas, drums, clapper talks, shadow plays, dances, and street speeches, to publicize the strength of the world's peace and democratic forces. The organs and troops stationed in Wuhan City are now intensely studying the three major documents: The Organic Law of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Organic Law of The Central Government, and the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, as well as Chairman Mao's opening speech at the CPPCC meeting, and speeches by Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Comrade Liu Shaoqi, and others. Commanders, fighters, and staff members expressed their complete support for the above three documents during the study. The commanders and fighters of the frontline troops are also celebrating the birth of the People's Republic and the arrival of the International Day of Struggle for Peace with unparalleled joy and high morale. All the commanders and fighters of a certain unit listened to the recorded reports of Chairman Mao and others broadcasted specifically for the Field Army by the Beijing Xinhua Broadcasting Station. At the end of each report, there were bursts of long-lasting cheers in the square, and the commanders and fighters stood up and stated: We must respond to Chairman Mao's call and celebrate the establishment of the Central People's Government by completely annihilating the remaining bandits in Central China and abiding by policies and disciplines. Combat hero Fan Chuili said, "We must celebrate the founding of the People's Republic with the victory of completely annihilating the remaining Chiang-Bai bandit army."
    Furthermore, when the People's Daily, which published the news of the opening of the CPPCC, was delivered to a certain division of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Beijing on the 24th, it immediately caused a burst of cheers, and the newspapers were snatched up in an instant.
    The good news of the grand founding ceremony spread like electricity. Yang Baoquan, a meritorious officer of the ××× regiment, ran through the classes and told every comrade the news. The Second Squad of the Guard Company automatically held a symposium to celebrate the opening of the CPPCC, and each comrade also made a plan to perform meritorious service, "Overcome family concepts, study and train hard, and never relax our fighting will, carry the revolution through to the end, and complete the task of defending New China." The next morning, all the meritorious officers of the regiment held another symposium to celebrate the opening of the CPPCC. Comrade Yuan En, who had performed three major meritorious services, said: "New China is our 'fruit of victory'!" It is our home, and we must protect the fruits and "home" that we have exchanged with blood and sweat. Everyone rushed to express: "We will always be a fighting team to support New China! No matter domestic or foreign, open or hidden reactionaries, whoever dares to move, the Central People's Government will give the order! We will set off immediately to eliminate them!"
