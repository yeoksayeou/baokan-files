　　Issues Autumn Grain Collection Instructions

　　Implement Tax Regulations, Strengthen Policy Education, Fairly and Reasonably Allocate Collection Tasks

　　[North China News] The North China People's Government issued instructions to the People's Governments of all provinces and cities on October 19 regarding the autumn grain collection work for 1949. The instructions first stated: The People's Liberation War has basically achieved a nationwide victory, and North China has entered a stage of peaceful construction. On a national scale, North China still bears the dual task of supporting the front lines and building the rear. According to the decision of the Shanghai National Financial and Economic Conference, although North China's agricultural tax burden this year is not much lighter than in the past two years, the actual burden is reduced considerably because North China has cancelled support-the-frontline services and stopped expanding the army. However, on the other hand, the serious disaster situation and the cessation of using military shoes, homespun cloth, and firewood to substitute for public grain have somewhat increased the difficulty of paying grain. Therefore, this year's autumn collection must sufficiently take into account the difficulties, and education and explanation must be carried out among cadres and the masses so that everyone is happy to bear the task. The following specific instructions were then given:

　　(1) In order to take care of military needs and people's livelihood and solve the need for industrial raw materials, it has been decided to collect a portion of peanuts and cotton in addition to grain this year. Governments at all levels should work hard to do this work well. For cotton, the masses must be mobilized to guarantee quality and meet the prescribed standards. County authorities are responsible for setting up warehouses to temporarily store peanuts and sesame (the commuted price and specific procedures will be instructed separately). In addition, in order to take care of the masses' difficulties in paying grain and solve currency problems, some areas can also collect a small amount of cash within the grain portion. The provincial government should submit its opinions on this matter and report it to the Finance Department of this government for approval.

　　(2) This year's autumn collection is shortly after the merger of various districts into large provinces. The development of various places is uneven, and the foundation for bearing the burden is inconsistent. The financial departments do not fully understand the areas under their jurisdiction, and there are many new cadres with little experience, which may lead to deviations. Leading organs at all levels should pay sufficient attention to prevent various adverse phenomena from occurring. If necessary, a collection committee can be organized to strengthen leadership based on work needs.

　　(3) The new tax regulations have been implemented for a year, and various regions have achieved considerable results, but many cadres still have vague policy viewpoints, and many masses do not fully understand the tax regulations. This autumn, we should earnestly implement the agricultural tax regulations and strengthen policy education so that cadres can correctly grasp the laws and regulations and effectively prevent the one-sided mass viewpoint and the purely task-oriented viewpoint that occurred in the past.

　　(4) During last year's autumn collection, many areas did not conduct sufficient investigation and research on the disaster situation, and the care and adjustment were inappropriate, which affected the balance of the burden and the completion of the collection work. This year's North China's harvest is extremely inconsistent, and some areas have varying degrees of disaster. The harvest is good and bad. We should accept past experience, conduct a comprehensive investigation, deeply understand the situation, and explain the reduction and exemption methods to the cadres and masses in the disaster areas so that they understand the spirit of reduction and exemption and the disaster victims feel the reduction is easy.

　　(5) The foundation for setting production in various regions of North China is unbalanced, and the phenomenon of being too high or too low is still very serious. If it is not adjusted, it will inevitably affect the reasonable burden of farmers. This autumn, we must conduct another production adjustment for areas with significant imbalances and carefully study and reasonably allocate tasks. (North China News Agency).

　　华北人民政府
  　发布秋征指示
    贯彻税则加强政策教育公平合理分配征收任务
    【华北讯】华北人民政府于十月十九日，对各省市人民政府发出关于一九四九年秋征工作的指示，该指示首谓：人民解放战争已基本上取得全国胜利，华北已转入和平建设的阶段，在全国范围来说，华北仍负担着支援前线与建设后方双重任务，据根上海全国财经会议决定，华北今年农业税任务虽比过去两年没有减轻多少，但华北已取消支前勤务，停止扩兵，则实际减轻不少。但另一方面却因为严重的灾情及停止以军鞋，土布，柴草代公粮办法，又多少增加了缴粮的困难，因此今年秋征须足够估计到困难，要向干部和群众进行教育解释，使大家乐于负担任务。继即具体指示了下列各点：
    （一）为照顾军需民有，解决工业原料的需要，今年除征收粮食外，并决定折征一部分花生和棉花，各级政府应将这一工作努力做好。棉花必须动员群众保证质量，符合规定标准，花生胡麻责成各县设库暂行保管（折价与具体手续另有指示）。此外为照顾群众缴粮困难与解决通货问题，有些地区在粮食部分内还可征收少数现款，此事应由省府提出意见，报本府财政部批准。
    （二）今年秋征是在合并各区成立大省之后不久，各地发展不平衡，负担工作基础不一致，财政部门对所属地区不尽了解，新干部多，经验少，可能发生偏差，各级领导机关应提起足够的注意，防止各种不良的现象发生，必要时可根据工作需要，组织征收委员会以加强领导。
    （三）新税则执行已经一年，各区获得不少成绩，但尚有不少干部政策观点模糊，不少群众对税则还不完全明了，今秋应切实贯彻农业税则，加强政策教育，使干部能正确掌握法令，切实防止过去所发生的片面群众观念，及单纯任务观点。
    （四）去年秋征中，有不少地区对灾情调查研究不够，照顾调剂不当，影响负担平衡与征收工作的完成，今年华北年景极不一致，某些地区受灾轻重不等，年景有好有坏，应接受以往经验，普遍进行调查，深入了解情况，并向灾区干部和群众讲明减免办法，使他们了解减免精神，灾民感到减的轻松。
    （五）华北各区订产基础不平衡，过高过低现象仍很严重，如不加以调整，势必影响农民负担合理，今年秋征对显著不平衡的地区，要再进行产量调整，对任务加以慎重研究和合理分配。（华府新闻室）。
