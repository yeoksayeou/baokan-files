Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 15th - Communist Party member Chen Laisheng safely and undamagedly preserved a large number of the Party's historical documents, and received a written commendation from the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. In July 1942, the Communist Party organization entrusted Chen Laisheng with the responsibility of safeguarding a large number of important historical documents, including meeting records of the CCP Central Committee when it was in Shanghai, meeting records of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee, instructions from the Central Committee to various regions and important correspondence, Party publications and newspapers such as "Red Flag," "Bolshevik," and "Party Life," photos of the militia martyrs who were shot and killed by counter-revolutionaries during the three Shanghai uprisings, and the posthumous writings of Peng Pai, Su Zhaozheng, and Yun Daiying. After accepting this glorious task, Chen Laisheng immediately mobilized and educated his parents, siblings, and other family members to assist in the transportation and disguise of the documents, and hid them in his home. Over the past seven years, despite multiple searches by the Japanese invaders, the Wang puppet regime, and the Kuomintang bandit gangs, these precious historical documents were preserved thanks to the active and responsible protection of Chen Laisheng and his family. At the same time, Chen Laisheng also carefully packaged the documents, regularly sprinkled them with camphor powder, and exposed them to the sun for inspection, so that these documents were protected from rat bites and insect infestations, and remained safe and sound. The written commendation from the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPC stated: "This is a manifestation of Comrade Chen Laisheng's loyalty and high sense of responsibility to the Party, and is worthy of emulation by all Party comrades." The Municipal Committee also expressed its gratitude to Chen Laisheng's family.

　　中共党员陈来生对党忠实负责
  　长期保藏党的珍贵历史文献
    获上海市委书面嘉奖
    【新华社上海十五日电】中国共产党党员陈来生安全无损地保存了党的大批历史文献，得到中共上海市委的书面嘉奖。一九四二年七月，共产党组织将一大批重要的历史文件，其中有中共中央在上海时的会议记录和江苏省委的会议记录，中央给各地的指示和来往重要文件，党刊、党报如“红旗”、“布尔塞维克”和“党的生活”，上海三次起义中被反革命枪杀的纠察队烈士照片，澎湃、苏兆征和恽代英的遗墨等，交由陈来生负责保管。陈来生接受这个光荣任务后，即动员和教育父母弟妹等全家人协助搬运，并加以伪装，保藏在自己家里。七年来，虽经日寇、汪伪和国民党匪帮的多次搜查，但由于陈来生及其家属的积极负责掩护，这批宝贵的历史文献都得以保存。同时，陈来生还细心地包装，经常洒樟瑙粉等和曝晒检查，使这些文件避免了鼠咬虫蛀，安然无损。中共上海市委书面嘉奖称：“这是陈来生同志对党忠实和高度负责的表现，值得全党同志学习。”市委并向陈来生家属表示感谢。
