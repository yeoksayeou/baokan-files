How I Learned to Write
    Ma Youqun, Attached High School of the Teachers College, Second Division

    I started writing in the fifth grade of elementary school. At that time, I often liked to use many adjectives or idioms in my compositions. This often earned me praise from Teacher Wang, so I put effort into this aspect.

    In the sixth grade, this teacher paid even more attention to description than Teacher Wang, asking the students to copy good sentences and good adjectives from the textbooks. At that time, I was the most active in responding to his call, which fostered my bad habit of only knowing how to "describe" and not paying attention to content.

    This teacher also liked classical Chinese, so he also had the students learn it, and often gave us classical Chinese essay topics. In this way, we often used the smattering of classical Chinese that we had learned.

    In August 1947, I went to apply to Lianzhong (now the Second Division of the Attached High School of the Teachers College). I thought: the things I learned in elementary school should be useful now, right!? The essay topic for this exam was: "Why are you applying to Lianzhong?" I wrote a whole set of classical Chinese: "...My application to Lianzhong is to seek to become a good cadre serving the people..." I felt that this essay of mine was very good. After I was admitted, due to the incomplete conditions in various aspects, I took temporary classes. During the Chinese class, Mr. Han shared my essay with everyone, pointing out that we did not need to write essays in classical Chinese now, and saying, "I don't know if this student passed the exam, I didn't give him a passing grade in Chinese..." This embarrassed me greatly, and I resolved never to use classical Chinese again.

    After the formal classes started, the first essay topic was: "My Journey to Take the Lianzhong Entrance Exam." I "described" it again. I remember this sentence: "...I stepped on the white frost on the ground to take the Lianzhong entrance exam..." Just imagine, could there be frost in August of the lunar calendar? This time, my essay was criticized by Mr. Han again. I said yes, but I thought to myself, "If I don't describe, will the sentence still be forceful? What do you know?"

    In winter, we went to Xihuangnibei to get coal, and after we came back, the essay topic was: "Carrying Coal." Because there was a Hutuo River between the school and Xihuangni, I wrote: "...The two banks of the Hutuo River are full of peach blossoms and green willows, as if we were in Switzerland..." Think about it, could there be peach blossoms and green willows in the dead of winter? After finishing this essay, I felt that I would definitely get an "A" this time. To my surprise, I got a "C+". Looking at the comments, it said: "Contradicts the facts, misuses idioms and adjectives, and must thoroughly correct this bad habit in the future..." I was unconvinced, so I went to ask Mr. Han. Mr. Han explained it to me again and again, and I suddenly realized. Looking at my own essay again, it was really ridiculous. I learned another lesson.

    Later, I wrote an essay called: "The Struggle Meeting in Beishifo, Laiyuan." This time, I was straightforward and wrote it in the language of the common people. After finishing it, I thought: this time it's over, can it still be considered an article without description? Who knew that when the essays were returned, I got an "A"! And it was marked: "Lively and forceful, hope you continue to work hard..." Ah! I finally understood what writing an article was all about. Later, when I wrote articles, I no longer "described" randomly.

　　我怎样学作文
    师大附中二部  马友群
    我开始作文是在小学五年级，那时的作文常爱多用形容词或成语。这样便时常得到王老师的夸奖，因此自己也就在这方面下功夫。
    到了六年级，这个先生比王老师更注意描写，让同学们抄书本上的好句子和好的形容词，那时我是响应他的号召最积极的一个，这样便养成我光知道“描写”，不注意内容的坏毛病。
    这位先生还喜欢文言文，所以也让同学们学，并且还常出文言文的作文题目，这样我们学的一知半解的文言文也常用。
    一九四七年八月我去投考联中（即现在的师大附中二部），我想：我在小学时学的东西该用着了吧！？这次考的作文题是：“你为什么来投考联中？”我就用文言文给写了一套：“……吾之投考联中者也，乃求得为人民服务良好干部哉……”我觉着我这篇文作的很好。考上后，因各方面的条件还不完备，所以就上临时课。在上国文课时，韩先生把我这篇作文给大家说了一次，指出现在我们不需要用文言作文，并说：“这位同学不知考上了没有，国文我没给他及格……。”这可把我臊坏了，便下决心再不用文言文了。
    正式上课后，第一次的作文题是：“我考联中的路上”，我又给“描写”了一番，我记得这么一句：“……我踏着地上的白霜，来考联中……。”你想，阳历八月间还能下霜吗？这回的作文又让韩先生给批评了一顿，我口里说是，但心里想：“不形容，句子还有力吗？你懂的什么？”
    到了冬天，我们去西黄泥背炭去，回来后就给出了个作文题是：“背炭”。因从学校去西黄泥当中隔着一条滹沱河，所以我这样写道：“……滹沱河的两岸，桃红柳绿，如同到了瑞士一般……。”你说，十冬腊月天还有桃红柳绿吗？这回作文作完后，我觉着这次一定能得个“甲”。出我意料之外的是得的是“丙上”，一看批的是：“与事实矛盾，乱用成语、形容词，今后须彻底改掉这一毛病……”我看了不服气，便去问韩先生，韩先生再三的给我解释，我才恍然大悟，再看自己的作文真是可笑。我又得到了个教训。
    后来我作了一篇作文是：“涞源北石佛的斗争大会”。我这回是直来直去，用老百姓的话写的。作完后我想：这回算完了，没描写还能算文章吗？谁知发下作文来一看得了个“甲”。并且还给我批着：“生动有力，希继续努力……。”啊！我才知道作文章是怎么回事。后来我作文章，就不再乱“描写”了。
