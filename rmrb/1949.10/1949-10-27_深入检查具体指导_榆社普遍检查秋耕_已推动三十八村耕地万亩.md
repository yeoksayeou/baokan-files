　　In-depth Inspection and Specific Guidance
    Yushe Conducts Universal Autumn Tillage Inspection
    Promoting 10,000 Mu of Cultivated Land in Thirty-Eight Villages
    [Taiyuan News] The leaders of Yushe County, Shanxi Province, have learned from the experiences and lessons of production leadership in recent years, correctly assessed the actual foundation and mass habits, and adopted a method of combining in-depth inspection and promotion with specific technical guidance to lead farmers throughout the county in a concentrated autumn tillage effort, ensuring universal plowing. After the Mid-Autumn Festival, cadres from county-level agencies went to the countryside in autumn tillage guidance groups, going to various districts to work with local cadres to deeply and specifically mobilize and organize the masses for autumn tillage, solving various difficulties and problems. As of now, a widespread and in-depth inspection movement has been launched throughout the county to promote autumn tillage. Shuimo Head Village in the Second District used activists in in-depth inspections, repeatedly inspected, and patiently compared mobilization results, achieving great success. Initially, after investigation, the village used the "three calculations" (calculating time, labor and animal power, and cultivated land) to overcome the complacency and slackness of the masses, who then actively helped each other and began to take action. However, further in-depth visits and investigations revealed that the masses still had some ideological problems, such as "cultivating mountain ridge land is not cost-effective," some masses only planned to cultivate land near their eyes, leaving the back ditch land empty, and many masses believed that it would be difficult to catch seedlings in stubble land if it was tilled. The autumn tillage guidance group immediately combined with the village cadres to study and analyze the above situation, reflecting the profound influence of farmers' ancient habits; then, on the one hand, they used the example of farmer Zhang Liuha and Zhang Gensheng, whose stubble land was tilled last year, and seedlings were caught at once this year despite the drought, while the untilled stubble land was not caught even after three times, to conduct scientific and technical propaganda and education, reversing the masses' attitude of half-belief towards tilling stubble land, etc., and the idea that cultivating mountain land was not cost-effective. On the other hand, they combined with veteran technical farmers to study specific autumn tillage techniques, carry forward good past experiences, and educate and change unscientific practices such as coarse plowing, too deep plowing, and using rolling board plows. They also implemented methods such as starting early and plowing as they harvested, having most of the livestock go to the fields early in the morning, and having specialists in plowing to improve technology, and have already tilled more than 500 mu of soybean and stubble land. After inspection, Hao Bi Village convened a meeting of households with surplus animal power and households without animal power, discussed the exchange of labor, and solved the problem of difficult animal power for more than ten households. The county has widely adopted the above methods, and after more than ten days of inspection and promotion and specific guidance, autumn tillage has achieved great results. According to statistics from thirty-eight villages before the tenth of this month, more than 12,000 mu of autumn land have been tilled. However, some villages are still in a state of spontaneous flow, lacking strong propaganda and specific help, and these shortcomings must be urgently overcome.

　　深入检查具体指导　
    榆社普遍检查秋耕　
    已推动三十八村耕地万亩
    【太原讯】山西榆社县领导上记取了年来生产领导中的经验教训，正确估计了实际基础及群众习惯，采取了深入检查推动与具体技术指导相结合的方法，领导全县农民突击秋耕，保证普犁一遍。中秋节后，县级各机关下乡干部，分别组织了秋耕指导组，赴各区结合当地区干深入具体动员组织群众秋耕，解决各种困难问题。至目前止，全县已开展了普遍深入的检查运动，推进秋耕。二区水磨头村在深入检查中运用了积极分子，反复检查，耐心对比动员成绩很大。开始，该村经过调查，用“三算”（算时间、算劳畜力、算耕地）办法，克服了群众中的自满松懈思想，纷纷互助，初步行动起来。但再次深入访问调查，又发现群众存在着“耕山岭地不合帐”，个别群众只打算耕眼边地，空下背沟地，以及不少群众认为谷茬地耕了明年难捉苗等若干思想问题。秋耕指导组当即与该村干部结合，研究分析了上述情况，是反映了农民古老习惯的深厚影响；继即一方面用农民张六孩与张根生去年谷地耕过，今年虽天旱，一次即捉住苗，未耕的谷茬地，三次也没捉住苗的实例对比与具体算帐，积极进行科学技术的宣传教育，扭转群众对耕谷茬地等是信非信的态度，以及耕山地不合算思想。一方面与技术老农结合，研究具体秋耕技术，发扬以往好的经验，教育改变犁粗犁太深与带滚板犁地等不科学作法。并贯彻了早动手随收随耕，牲畜绝大部分早上地，专人掌犁提高技术等办法，已耕豆、谷茬地五百余亩。郝壁村经过检查，召开了剩余畜力户与无畜力户会议，讨论了变换工，十余户耕地畜力困难得到解决。全县广泛采用上述方法，经过十余天的检查推动与具体指导，秋垡地已获得很大成绩，据三十八个村本月十号前统计，已耕秋地一万二千余亩。但尚有某些村庄陷于自流，缺乏有力宣传与具体帮助等缺点，急须加以克服。
