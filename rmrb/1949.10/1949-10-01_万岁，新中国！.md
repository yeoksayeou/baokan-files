　　Long Live, New China!
    The People's Republic of China, which we have long and eagerly awaited, has been founded! All the Chinese people, with millions upon millions of excited hearts and boiling enthusiasm, welcome this great and glorious sunrise—the historical era of the New Democratic people's century.

    Facing this radiant dawn of history, we shout: Long live—New China! Long live—the people's century! Long live—Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese nation and people!

    The whole world, all peace-loving and freedom-loving people of all nations, are fixing their eyes on the East; and upon seeing the victory of the greatest people's revolution after the Soviet Union's October Revolution and the victory of the anti-fascist World War, they rejoice and feel infinite glory.

    Looking back over the modern history of more than a hundred years, it is a revolutionary history of the Chinese nation and people engaging in a long-term and heroic struggle against imperialism and feudalism. But it was not until July 1921, when the Communist Party of China was born, that the Chinese people obtained their savior; and the strength of the Chinese people's revolution grew stronger and stronger in the struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism.

    Today, the Chinese people have finally basically defeated imperialism and its running dog, the Kuomintang reactionaries. Today, the Chinese nation and people, under the banner of their leader—Mao Zedong, have created, according to scientific ideals, a people's democratic dictatorship-based nation—the People's Republic of China and the Central People's Government, founded on the worker-peasant alliance.

    This is a great comedy of complete liberation for the 475 million Chinese people, a new birth of a people's century. Faced with this great historical beginning, we shout: Long live—the People's Republic of China! We shout: Long live—the people's century! We shout: Long live—Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people and nation!

    From now on, our nation and people will forever be free from the status of being enslaved and oppressed; from now on, our nation and people will stand on the front lines of their historical era, advancing with heads held high, and laboring diligently for the happiness of themselves and all of humanity. "Our nation will henceforth be included in the great family of peace-loving and freedom-loving nations of the world, working with a brave and diligent attitude, creating its own civilization and happiness, and at the same time, promoting world peace and freedom."
　　　 פון (Mao Zedong: Opening speech of the People's Political Consultative Conference)

    From now on, we, the 475 million Chinese people of all nationalities, on our vast and boundless land of 9,597,000 square kilometers and our unified and beautiful rivers and mountains, will proudly and universally erect the banner of the new China, independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, and prosperous, fluttering in the wind. Any imperialism that dares to set foot on our land will surely bring about its own destruction; from now on, due to the victory of the great revolution of the Chinese nation and people, the world anti-imperialist democratic and peace front, headed by the Soviet Union, will further strengthen its unstoppable lineup.

    The People's Republic of China is born. Long live—New China! Long live—the people's historical century! Long live—our beloved leader of the people, Mao Zedong!

　　万岁，新中国！
    我们所长久殷切盼望的中华人民共和国成立了，全中国人民，以几千百万颗激动的心和沸腾似的热情，来迎接这个伟大的光辉的日出——新民主主义的人民世纪底历史年代。
    面对着这光芒万丈的历史底初启的日照，我们高呼：万岁——新中国，万岁——人民的世纪，万岁——中国民族和人民的领袖毛泽东！
    全世界，一切爱好和平与自由的各族人民，都将他们的眼睛，凝视着东方；并由于看见了继苏联十月革命，和反法西斯世界大战胜利之后，最伟大的人民革命底胜利，而欢欣鼓舞，并感到无限光荣。
    回溯一百多年了的近代历史，就是中国民族人民与帝国主义、封建主义长期地进行英勇斗争的革命历史。但是直到一九二一年七月，中国共产党出世以后，中国人民才得到了自己的救主；而中国人民革命的力量，也就在反帝、反封建、反官僚资本的斗争中日益生长茁壮了起来。
    今天，中国人民，终于基本上战胜了帝国主义及基走狗国民党反动集团。对于人民的黑暗统治；今天，中华民族和人民，在自己的领袖——毛泽东底旗帜下，按照科学理想创造了以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政底国家——中华人民共和国和中央人民政府。
    这是中国四万万七千五百万人民彻底翻身的大喜剧，这是一个人民世纪底新生。面对了这个伟大的历史底开端，我们高呼：万岁——中华人民共和国，我们高呼：万岁——人民的世纪，我们高呼：万岁——中国人民和民族底伟大领袖毛泽东。
    我们的民族和人民，从此将永远脱离被奴役和压迫的地位；我们的民族和人民，从此将站在自己历史时代的阵地上，昂首前进，为自己和全世界人类底幸福而辛勤劳动。“我们的民族，将从此列入爱好和平自由的世界各民族大家庭，以勇敢而勤劳的姿态工作着，创造自己的文明和幸福，同时，也促进世界的和平与自由。”
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（毛泽东：人民政协开幕词）
    从此，我们这四万万七千五百万的中国各族人民，在自己九百五十九万七千方公里的辽阔无边的国土和锦绣一统的河山上，将高高地普遍树起独立、民主、和平、统一和富强的新中国底招展迎风之旗。任何帝国主义，如敢于插足我土，必将自取灭亡；从此，由于我中国民族和人民大革命之胜利，使以苏联为首的世界反帝国主义民主和平战线，更增强其势不可挡的阵容。
    中华人民共和国诞生了。万岁——新中国；万岁——人民底历史世纪；万岁——我们敬爱的人民底领袖毛泽东！
