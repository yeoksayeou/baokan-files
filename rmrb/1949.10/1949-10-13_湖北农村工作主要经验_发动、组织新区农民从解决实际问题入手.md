Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, December 12th: The main experience of rural work in the newly liberated areas of Hubei Province over the past three months has been to approach, mobilize, and organize the masses by addressing their most pressing demands and starting with the resolution of practical problems. Before liberation, bandits, local bullies, and secret agents formed a trinity to cruelly rule the peasants in rural Hubei. After liberation, the peasants' most urgent demands were to suppress bandits and oppose local bullies. For example, in Yicheng County, bandits were rampant in April and May, organizing riots and looting everywhere. At that time, the county's leading organs, based on the masses' urgent demands, concentrated all their efforts on suppressing bandits. After the main bandit forces were largely eliminated, local work was immediately launched to expose the crimes of the bandits and call on the masses to defend themselves against bandits. As a result, the masses' enthusiasm was unprecedentedly high, and they actively reported bandits or led the way in suppressing them, thereby launching a struggle against local bullies. In May, out of 840 "bao" in the four counties of Xiangyang, Nanzhang, Guanghua, and Gucheng, 440 "bao" launched struggles against local bullies and bandit suppression, overthrowing the puppet "bao-jia" rule and establishing the people's own political power. After most of Hubei was liberated in June, rural work began to focus on the summer grain collection. Landlords and local bullies used various methods to shift the burden onto the peasants, and at that time, the peasants' urgent demand was for a reasonable burden. Various localities seized on this key aspect to launch a struggle against unfair burdens and against "black land" (i.e., land concealed by landlords and local bullies to evade the burden), exposing the crimes of landlords and local bullies and raising the class consciousness of the peasant masses. The peasant representative meetings held in various places played a significant role in this work. In the first district of Xiaogan County, peasants were organized through the peasant representative meetings, and over 10,000 "shi" of black land belonging to landlords and rich peasants were found, completing the summer grain collection task in half a month. Through these efforts, by the end of August, counties such as Daye, Echeng, Mianyang, Jianli, Yichang, and Xiaogan began to break through the work in key areas and expand it further. In many areas, peasants spontaneously organized militias to defend their hometowns. At the same time, peasant associations also greatly developed. The peasant associations in the four counties of Guanghua, Nanzhang, Xiangyang, and Gucheng alone had more than 60,000 members.

Another important experience in mobilizing peasants is that it is necessary to go through adequate ideological education. The most important method in educational work is to encourage the masses to "pour out grievances" and "dig out the roots of poverty." After the peasants in the first district of Nanzhang County underwent grievance sessions and class education, they automatically drew cartoons of the crimes of the local bully Sun Huanzhang and compiled them into rhythmic verses when fighting against him. These were posted all over the meeting place and sent to peasants more than twenty "li" away, influencing the surrounding masses. At that time, many peasants took the initiative to go to the district public office and asked to send cadres to their villages to help them stand up. Encouraged by the victory, the peasants in the county spontaneously organized more than 400 stretchers to support the front line in the southern expedition.

However, in the mass movement during this period, there were also many shortcomings. For example, in general, cadres could not clearly grasp the principles of the mass movement ideologically, and regarded mobilizing the masses as a means of collecting grain. Politically, they were numb and lacked vigilance against bandits, local bullies, and secret agents, so that the peasant associations in some areas were controlled by bandits and local bullies. Among a small number of cadres, there were serious hedonistic and corrupt thoughts and behaviors, hindering the development of the mass movement. Since the Hubei Provincial Party Congress in mid-August decided that, in order to implement the policy of suppressing bandits, opposing local bullies, and mobilizing the masses, it was necessary to combine the rectification of one's own ranks with the mobilization of the masses and strengthen cadre education, the counties successively held cadre conferences in September and have begun to implement this resolution.

　　湖北农村工作主要经验
    发动、组织新区农民从解决实际问题入手
    【新华社汉口十二日电】根据群众最迫切的要求，从解决实际问题入手，来接近、发动和组织群众，这是三个月来湖北省新解放区农村工作的主要经验。解放前，湖北农村中土匪、恶霸、特务三位一体对农民进行着残酷的统治。解放后，农民最迫切的要求就是剿匪和反恶霸，如宜城县在四五月中土匪猖獗，到处组织暴动，打家劫舍。当时该县领导机关即根据群众这一迫切的要求，集中全力剿匪。在股匪大体消灭后，立即展开地方工作，揭发土匪罪行，号召群众防匪自卫，因此群众情绪空前提高，纷纷起来密告土匪或带路剿匪，进而展开了反恶霸的斗争。五月份，在襄阳、南漳、光化、谷城四个县八百四十个保中，就有四百四十个保开展了反恶霸、剿匪的斗争，推翻了伪保甲统治，建立了人民自己的政权。六月份，湖北大部地区解放后，农村工作开始以夏季征粮为中心。地主恶霸又用种种方法将负担转嫁给农民，当时农民的迫切要求是合理负担。各地即抓紧这一环节展开了反负担不公、反黑地（即地主恶霸将田地隐瞒，逃避负担）的斗争，揭发了地主、恶霸的罪行，提高了农民群众的阶级觉悟。在这一工作中，各地召开的农民代表会起了重大的作用。孝感县第一区通过农民代表会组织农民，查出地主、富农的黑地一万余石，半个月就完成了夏征任务。经过这些工作，八月底，大冶、鄂城、沔阳、监利、宜昌、孝感等县开始突破了重点区的工作，扩大开去。在很多地区，农民自动组织了民兵，捍卫自己的家乡。同时，农会也得到了很大发展。仅光化、南漳、襄阳、谷城等四个县的农会，就拥有会员六万余名。
    发动农民的另一个重要经验，是必须要经过充分的思想教育。在教育工作中最重要的方法是启发群众“诉苦”和“挖穷根”，南漳县第一区农民经过诉苦及阶级教育后，在斗争恶霸孙焕章时，自动将恶霸罪行画成漫画，编成快板，遍贴会场，并向二十余里以外地区的农民，发送传单，影响了周围的群众。当时就有很多农民主动到区公所去，要求派干部到村里去帮助他们翻身。在胜利鼓舞下，该县农民并自动组织了四百余付担架南征，支援前线。
    但在这一时期的群众运动中，也存在着不少缺点，如一般干部在思想上对群众运动的方针还不能明确掌握，把发动群众看做为征粮的手段。政治上麻痹，对土匪、恶霸、特务缺乏警惕，以致某此地区的农会为土匪恶霸所控制。在一小部分干部中，存在着严重的享乐腐化思想和行为，阻碍了群众运动的发展。自八月中旬湖北省党代表会议决定为了贯彻剿匪、反恶霸和发动群众的方针，必须在发动群众中结合整顿自己的队伍，加强干部教育后，各县于九月份相继召开了干部大会，并已开始执行这一决议。
