Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 11th: The People's Liberation Army unit that liberated Hengyang was warmly welcomed by workers, students, and citizens of Hengyang when it entered the city from the Yuehan Railway Station at 10:00 am on October 8th. They rushed forward to shake hands with the soldiers, excitedly saying, "Catch them all (referring to the White bandits)!" The several-mile-long street was filled with tea and refreshments, and many boatmen gathered on the Xiang River to help the People's Liberation Army cross the river to pursue the enemy. The White bandits blew up the floating bridge on the Xiang River, but could not stop the advance of our army. After the People's Liberation Army entered the city, order was quickly restored. The electricity company restored power supply that night, and shops and theaters all operated as usual. People eagerly watched the announcements of the People's Liberation Army posted on the streets, and even late at night, some people were reading them with lanterns.

Before fleeing on the afternoon of the 7th, the White bandits attempted to sabotage all important industrial equipment such as the Hengyang Railway Bureau and various factories. However, due to the rapid and courageous pursuit of the People's Liberation Army and the ingenious protection of workers and staff of various factories, except for minor damage to the Yuehan Road Machinery Plant and the station's buildings, roadbeds, and a few vehicles, everything else was intact.

Now the workers are vigorously repairing the projects destroyed by the White bandits. Telephone workers set out to explore lines everywhere, Yuehan Road workers worked overnight to repair the destroyed roadbed, and most of the factories belonging to the railway have also resumed work.

　　衡阳秩序迅速恢复市民热烈欢迎我军
    【新华社长沙十一日电】解放衡阳的人民解放军某部，于十月八日晨十时由粤汉铁路车站进入市区时，受到了衡阳工人、学生和市民们的热烈欢迎。他们抢着上前与战士们握手，激动地说：“要一个不剩的捉住他们（指白匪）啊！”几里路长的大街上，摆满了茶水点心，许多船工集合在湘江边帮助解放军渡江追击敌人。白匪炸毁湘江浮桥，也挡不住大军前进。解放军进入市区后，市面秩序迅速恢复。电灯公司当夜就恢复送电，各店铺、戏院均照常营业。人民争看街头张贴的人民解放军的布告，到夜深时还有人提着灯笼阅读。
    白匪在七日下午撤逃前，曾企图破坏衡阳铁路局和各工厂等一切重要工业设备，但由于解放军迅速勇猛的追击，与各厂工人职员的机智保护，除了粤汉路机厂和车站的房屋道基及少数车辆，遭受轻微破坏外，余均完整无损。
    现在工人们正在大力修复被白匪破坏了的工程。电话工人出发到各处探索线路，粤汉路工人连夜抢修炸毁了的路基，铁路所属各工厂也大都复工。
