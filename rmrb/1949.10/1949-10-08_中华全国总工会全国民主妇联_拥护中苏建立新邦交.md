All-China Federation of Trade Unions, National Democratic Women's Federation
Endorse the Establishment of New Diplomatic Relations Between China and the Soviet Union

[Reported by this newspaper] The All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the National Democratic Women's Federation have successively issued written statements, expressing their gratitude for the great friendship shown by the Soviet Union in being the first to recognize New China and warmly endorsing the establishment of new diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union. The original texts are as follows:

All-China Federation of Trade Unions

On the second day of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the great Union of Soviet Socialist Republics was the first to recognize our country and establish diplomatic relations with us. This fact is yet another proof that Chairman Mao's instruction is completely correct: "Internationally, we belong to the anti-imperialist front headed by the Soviet Union, and genuine friendly assistance can only be sought from this side." The working class and the people of the whole country were overjoyed and deeply grateful to the socialist Soviet Union led by the great Stalin for giving us such profound friendship.

The Chinese working class and the broad masses of the people will never forget the Soviet Union's consistent friendly attitude towards us: the Soviet Union was the first to abolish unequal treaties and treat us as equals. It was the Soviet Union that actively supported us in the Northern Expedition against imperialism and feudalism, leading to the great victory of the Great Revolution. It was the Soviet Union that first provided manpower and material support to us after the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War. After defeating Hitler's fascist Germany, the Soviet Union sent a million troops to wipe out the main force of the Japanese invaders, the Kwantung Army, enabling our Northeast to be the first to be liberated. Today, on the second day of the birth of New China, it is still the Soviet Union that first recognizes us and establishes diplomatic relations with us!

The All-China Federation of Trade Unions calls on the working class of the whole country to give play to the brave and diligent traditional spirit of the Chinese working class and the broad masses of the people, to learn from the Soviet Union diligently, to consolidate the deep friendship between China and the Soviet Union, and to step up the construction of New China, as a thank you for the profound friendship given to us by the socialist Soviet Union.

The great victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War and the People's Revolution has unprecedentedly strengthened the power of the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union. Let our enemies tremble before us! The power of the world's working class and people is invincible, and victory belongs to us! Workers of all countries, unite! Oppose the new war of aggression headed by American imperialism, and strive for lasting world peace! Long live the deep friendship between China and the Soviet Union! Long live Chairman Mao, the leader of the Chinese people! Long live Marshal Stalin, the leader and teacher of the people of the world!

National Democratic Women's Federation

Our women all over the country are joyously celebrating the founding of the People's Republic of China, and now we have received the news that the Soviet government has officially recognized our government and decided to establish diplomatic relations with us and exchange ambassadors. This makes us doubly excited and infinitely joyful!

Facts have proved that the socialist Soviet people and the Soviet government have always been the most sincere friends of the Chinese people in the past thirty years and up to now. We all know that the Soviet Union has overcome all difficulties to give us encouragement and support during the most difficult years of the Chinese people's revolution. Now that the obstacles hindering the friendship between our two great nations of China and the Soviet Union have been removed, the road for closer cooperation between the people of the two countries has been paved. We believe that the establishment of new diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union will surely make the deep friendship between the people of the two countries more consolidated and grow stronger day by day.

Soviet women have achieved genuine liberation and equality in the great socialist country, and their victory has pointed out the direction for us Chinese women. Their efforts in the process of nation-building and their work experience, their achievements in culture, art, education, and science, and their achievements in women's and children's welfare work will now be easier for us to learn from, due to the formal establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries. Let us gradually catch up and emulate our Soviet sisters!

　　中华全国总工会全国民主妇联
    拥护中苏建立新邦交
    【本报讯】中华全国总工会、全国民主妇联，相继发表书面意见，对苏联首先承认新中国的伟大友情表示感谢，并热烈拥护中苏建立新邦交。原文如下：
    　　　　中华全国总工会
    中华人民共和国成立的第二天，首先承认我国与我建立外交关系的就是伟大的苏维埃社会主义联盟共和国。这一事实是又一次证明了毛主席的指示：“我们在国际上是属于以苏联为首的反帝国主义战线一方面的，真正的友谊的援助只能向这一方面去找”的完全正确。全国工人阶级和全国人民听到这个喜讯，无不欢欣鼓舞，深深感谢伟大的斯大林所领导的社会主义苏联给予我们深厚无比的友谊。
    中国工人阶级和广大人民始终忘不了苏联对我们一贯的友好态度：第一个废除不平等条约以平等待我的，是苏联。在中国人民进行反帝反封建的北伐战争中对我们积极加以支持的，获得大革命伟大胜利的，是苏联；在我国抗日战争爆发后，首先以人力物力支援我们的，是苏联；在击败希特勒法西斯德国之后，出师百万歼灭日寇大陆主力关东军，使我东北首先获得解放的，是苏联；今天，在新中国诞生的第二天首先承认我们与我们建立外交关系的，还是苏联！
    中华全国总工会号召全国工人阶级，要发挥中国工人阶级与广大人民勇敢而勤劳的传统精神，努力向苏联学习，巩固中苏两国深厚的友谊，加紧建设新中国，作为我们对于社会主义苏联所给予我们的深厚无比友谊的感谢。
    中国人民解放战争和人民革命的伟大胜利，就空前壮大了以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营的力量，让我们的敌人在我们面前发抖吧！世界工人阶级和人民的力量是不可战胜的，胜利是属于我们的！全世界无产阶级联合起来，反对以美国帝国主义为首的新的侵略战争，争取世界持久和平！中苏两国深厚的友谊万岁！中国人民领袖毛主席万岁！全世界人民领袖和导师斯大林大元帅万岁！
    　　　　全国民主妇联
    我们全国妇女，正在兴高彩烈地庆祝中华人民共和国的成立，又得到苏联政府正式承认我国政府，并决定与我建立外交关系、互派大使的消息，真是加倍的兴奋，无限的欢欣！
    事实证明：社会主义的苏联人民和苏联政府，过去三十年来直到现在，始终是中国人民最真诚的朋友。在中国人民革命最艰困的岁月里，苏联仍排除万难给予我们鼓励与支援等等，是我们大家知道的。现在阻碍我们中苏两大民族友谊的障碍已经铲除了，两国人民之间进一步密切合作的道路已经铺平了，我们相信，由于中苏新的外交关系的建立，必将使两国人民间深厚的友谊更加巩固，更加与日俱增。
    苏联妇女，在伟大的社会主义国家中，已经得到了真正的解放与平等，她们的胜利给我们中国妇女指出了方向。她们在建国过程中的努力，和工作经验，她们在文化、艺术、教育、科学各方面的成就；她们在妇女儿童福利工作方面的成绩；现在由于两国正式建立外交关系，将更便于我们向她们学习。让我们逐渐迎头赶上，向苏联姊妹们看齐！
