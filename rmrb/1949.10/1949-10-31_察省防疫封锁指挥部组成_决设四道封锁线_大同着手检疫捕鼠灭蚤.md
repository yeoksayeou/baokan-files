The Chahar Province Epidemic Prevention Committee held its fourth meeting yesterday, presided over by Yang Gengtian of the Provincial Party Committee and Zhang Su, Chairman of the Provincial Government. The meeting decided to establish an Epidemic Prevention and Blockade Headquarters, with Wang Ping, Commander of the Chahar Military Region, as the director. The North China Military Region was authorized to unify command of the armed forces stationed in Chahar Province to implement strict blockades. Four blockade lines will be established throughout Chahar Province: from Dushikou in Chicheng County along the outer Great Wall in the east to Niekou Fort in Yanggao County in the west; from Huairen, Datong, through Xuanhua Town to Yunzhou in Chicheng County; from Huashaoying in Xuanhua County to Huangyukou in Yanqing; and on the border between Chahar and Hebei. In addition, a number of blockade lines will be set up on the borders of epidemic and non-epidemic areas to prevent anyone from leaking out of the epidemic areas. Junction points will be set up at important transportation hubs from Zhangjiakou to Beijing, Datong, and northern Chahar to exchange necessary goods. All materials from northern Chahar are prohibited from being transported to Zhangjiakou. Necessary official business will be contacted by telephone, but personnel and vehicles that must travel will be subject to inspection and disinfection.

[Another dispatch] On October 23, the Zhangjiakou Municipal Epidemic Prevention Committee held a joint meeting of district heads and heads of public security sub-bureaus to deploy epidemic prevention work throughout the city. It was decided that each district should organize an epidemic prevention station, with the head of the public security sub-bureau serving as the station chief, responsible for educating and organizing the masses, collecting epidemic information, and carrying out flea extermination and rat catching. Efforts should also be actively organized to prepare for vaccination as soon as the vaccines arrive.

[Another dispatch] Datong City established an Epidemic Prevention Headquarters on the 27th and has formed a quarantine team to conduct inspections at city gates and train stations. The city is currently undertaking rat catching and flea extermination and is controlling people coming from northern Chahar.
