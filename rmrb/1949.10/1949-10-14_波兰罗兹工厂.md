　　Łódź Factories in Poland
　　By Yiertonski, Translated by Zhang Erchangjie

　　The main train station in Łódź is called Łódź Factories. We can hardly find a more suitable name to describe this city—the heart of Poland's textile industry. The train station is close to a main street in the city, with tall chimneys on both sides and rows of dark red brick walls, all of which are textile factories—cotton spinning, weaving, wool, and cotton factories. The surroundings of the larger factories are where the workers live—also gloomy red brick houses. Smaller factories are scattered everywhere, surrounded by many dilapidated thatched houses, where the workers live.

　　Łódź developed unplanned from several factory villages that gradually expanded and eventually merged. German merchants Swick, Scheibler, and others did their best to occupy a lot of land, building small textile factories. They wasted a lot of land building luxurious mansions for themselves, without any consideration for the workers' living conditions. Cheap labor was abundant, and unemployment was a lifelong hardship for textile workers. They often could only work three or four days a week. Łódź, now famous for her textiles a century later, was originally a place where poor weavers suffered.

　　New Poland inherited a meager legacy from the city of Łódź. Most of the factory equipment was dilapidated. Working conditions were unsafe and unsanitary. Almost more than half of the families only had one room. Ninety percent of the houses had no sewers, and eighty-three percent had no water supply.

　　Nevertheless, after Warsaw was destroyed, and a major fire left only the large buildings in the Wrocław district, Łódź was valued. She was hardly damaged in the war and was relatively easy to rebuild. More than a thousand modern houses will be completed this year. Transportation has also been improved, with dozens of kilometers of new tram lines laid. The originally messy thatched houses will be replaced by rows of well-arranged, well-ventilated houses.

　　Caring for children and helping female workers solve family problems are things that have only happened since these factories were handed over to the people, and are important work of the factories and the workers' own organizations. The state-owned First Clothing Factory—formerly the German merchant Swick factory—now has two shifts of workers on duty every day, and some factories have three shifts a day. Unemployment is a thing of the past, and tens of thousands of female workers have participated in production work.

　　In Łódź and other places—Katowice, the center of coal and metal industries, Gliwice, the main coal and steel industry center in southern Poland—we see beautifully decorated, clean nurseries and kindergartens everywhere. Female workers were initially reluctant to entrust their children to strangers all day long, but now it is difficult for nurseries and kindergartens to meet the growing needs.

　　We also visited some factory-affiliated institutions: shoe repair shops, clothing stores, and pharmacies. These were not available when the German merchants were in charge.

　　We visited the work of the First Clothing Factory; we saw Maria wearing a green coat standing between two looms, she was still a young female worker of medium height. Her eyes were fixed on the vibrating wool threads, watching the shuttle move back and forth. The looms shook the floor, and the air was filled with a non-stop rhythmic sound, and you had to be close to the ear to hear clearly when talking. Maria effortlessly and calmly found the irregular yarns, and skillfully repaired the spinning wheels of the moving loom. From the large wool combing wheel to the machine that printed a roll of fabric every three minutes, the work of the entire factory can be expressed in this kind of normal and stable rhythm.

　　In the manager's office, we saw a record of this rhythmic work represented by red lines; the 1947 plan was completed on December 10th. The 1948 plan was larger, but it was also completed on November 17th. There is no doubt that this year's production plan will also be completed ahead of schedule, although the plan is even larger than before.

　　Many factories have high work efficiency in terms of raw materials, technology, and the management of all work. The most important thing is that every worker's performance is very good. Maria's contribution is commendable; for several months, the group she led has been producing top-quality goods. She told us that her experience came from Alexander and Zhutejia—Soviet reformers. Her secret is to cherish the machine, learn to adjust the rotation, control every movement of the shuttle, and pay attention to every yarn. "This is very easy, not new at all," Maria told us.

　　Winte, who guided us to visit, said: "In some factories, there are still many idle and unconcerned workers. They only agree with the saying that 'there are no 100% good goods.' People who don't understand business skills and newcomers to the factory also think so; therefore, a very harmful mood and work attitude are produced. Maria and her group, however, broke this bad habit by using their work and themselves as examples. They showed everyone that anything can be successful and challenged everyone. They are inspired by the professional pride of technicians and the socialist work enthusiasm of conscious workers, working for themselves and for the people's country."

　　At the first Łódź City Labor Party Conference, the Minister of Light Industry awarded Maria with a bouquet of roses. She said: "Before our eyes, the entire Poland is being transformed by the work of our hands! My group has not done much to build a new Poland, and in our factory, the groups of Shaman and Kluga are now doing as well as us!"

　　Naturally, the experience of Maria and her group is just the easiest and simplest example, and the words of those lazy workers have a reactionary effect, and those who seek profit and self-interest are always mocking the advancing workers, doubting their honest work attitude. This is a struggle between the new and the old. The number of progressive workers in Poland has been increasing, and it is they who will win in this struggle, and the future victory belongs to them.

　　We strolled along the wide, tree-lined Paifeiwa factory with Cenina. She had finished her shift, but was still wearing an oil-stained blue coat. We saw her wearing a bronze cross for excellent workers shimmering in the sun on her chest. She said: "Getting a medal is not difficult, the difficulty is to eliminate everyone's doubts about a girl doing a man's job."

　　Cenina completed 125% of her work in the first week and 130% in the second week. And now there are dozens of female workers working at the Paifeiwa factory, and no one is surprised or doubtful anymore.

　　This factory had spent a long time assembling locomotives, and Manager Mickey persuaded Comrade Foreman to gather young workers and ask them to volunteer to help; the old engineer, the foreman, shook his head suspiciously, thinking that his experience was not enough to do the job. The manager automatically found a group of young workers with less experience and told them the difficulties. "Okay! We'll assemble it!" Luo Lake decided in one sentence. Three months later, at the May Day celebration, Rockla was rewarded for leading the assembly team, and the assembly of internal parts of the locomotive was no longer difficult.

　　The workers developed the Pfeiffer factory from the ruins. Three-quarters of this factory had been completely destroyed by the German invaders, and the equipment had been dismantled or hidden, and now it has been found again and installed. Pfeiffer's current production efficiency is very high, and the record of 10 locomotives per week when the German merchant Pfeiffer was in charge has been restored.

　　Next to this factory stands a new club, with a tram line built exclusively by the factory leading to the workers' residential area, where there are sports fields, a workers' university, and a cinema. In the evening, songs are often heard in the temporary summer park. The Palace of Culture is also starting to be built. The destroyed Wrocław district cannot be repaired for three to five years, but the city of Łódź is growing before our eyes.

### 波兰罗兹工厂

　　波兰罗兹工厂
    伊尔顿斯基著  张耳常节译
    罗兹城主要的火车站被人叫做罗兹工厂。我们几乎找不出适于描写这城市——波兰纺织工业的心脏的名称。火车站靠近城内一条主要的街道，左右都有高高的烟囱，一排又一排的阴暗的红砖墙，这都是纺织工厂——纺花的，织布的，羊毛和棉花的工厂。其中较大的一家工厂的四周就是工人居住的地方—同样是阴郁的红砖房。较小的工厂散布各处，四周有许多倒塌的草房，工人们就住在里面。
    罗兹是毫无计划地从几个渐渐扩大而终于合并的工厂村落发展出来的。德国商人斯维克，薛布勒和其他一些商人尽他们的力量占有许多土地，建造了一些小纺织厂。浪费许多土地为他们自己修建豪华的大厦，一点也不顾虑工人们的居住问题。廉价的劳工很多，失业常是纺织工人终身的苦难。他们经常只能做三四天工。罗兹，一世纪后的现在以她的纺织品而著名于世，原是一个可怜的织工们受苦的地方。
    新波兰从罗兹城获得一份可怜的遗产。大多数工厂设备是朽坏的。工作条件都不安全，不合卫生。几乎有半数以上的家庭仅有一间房子。百分之九十的房子没有阴沟，百分之八十三没有取水的设备。
    虽然如此，华沙被破坏后，一场大火只留下罗克莱区的大建筑物，罗兹就被重视了。她在战争中几乎没有受损害，也比较容易重建。一千多所近代化的住宅将在今年内完工。运输工作也改进了，新铺了数十公里长的电车道。本来是杂乱的草房的地方将出现许多整排的，位置适当，空气流通的房屋。
    爱护儿童，帮助女工解决家庭问题是这些工厂移交到人民的手中以后才有的事，而且是工厂和工人们自己的组织的重要工作。国营的第一被服厂——以前的德商斯威克工厂现在每天有两班工人值工，有的工厂一天值三班。失业已是过时代的陈迹了，数万女工都已参加了生产工作。
    在罗兹和其他地方——卡托维斯，煤和金属业的中心，格里维斯，南波兰主要的煤和钢业中心——到处我们都看见装设得很美观的，清洁的保育院和保育学校。女工们最初不愿把孩子整天托交给不相识的人，而现在儿童保育院和保育学校却很难满足逐渐增加的需要了。
    我们还参观了一些工厂附属的机构；有修鞋店，成衣店，还有药铺。这都是在德国商人手中时所没有的。
    我们参观第一被服厂的工作；看见玛利亚穿着绿外衣站在两架织布机中间，她还是一个中等个儿的年青女工。她两眼盯着震颠着的羊毛线，注视着梭子来回穿行。织布机震动了楼板，空气中充满了不停的有节奏的＠＠之声，谈话时必须靠近耳朵才清楚。玛利亚毫无差错地从容地找出不整齐的纱线，敏捷地修整好正在转动的织机的轮盘。从梳理羊毛的大轮到每三分钟印好一卷布匹的机器，全厂的工作都可以从这一种正常的，稳定的节奏中表现出来。
    在经理室中，我们看见这有节奏的工作用红线条表示出来的纪录；一九四七年的计划在十二月十号就完成了。一九四八年的计划较大，可是十一月十七日也完工了。毫无疑问的是今年的生产计划也将提前完成，虽然计划比以前更大。
    原料，工艺和全部工作的管理方面，许多工厂都有很高的工作效能。最重要的是每一个工人的成绩都很优良。玛利亚的贡献是值得称道的；数月来，她所领导的小组生产的尽是头等品质的货色。她对我们说她的经验得自亚力山大，珠特珈——苏联的改革家。她的秘密就是爱护机器，学会调节转动，控制每一个梭子的动作，注意每一根纺纱。“这是很容易的，一点也不新鲜”。玛利亚对我们这样说。
    引导我们参观的温特说：“有些工厂中还有许多游手好问的和不注意工作的工人。他们只会附和“没有百分之百的好货色”的说法。不懂商业技能的和初到工厂的人也认为如此；因此产生了一种极有害的情绪和工作态度。玛利亚和她的小组却以她们的工作和自身做例子打破了这种坏习性。她们给大家指明了什么事都能成功，而且向大家挑战。她们被技工的职业自尊心和觉悟的工人所有的社会主义的工作热情激发，为自己工作，为人民的国家工作”。
    第一届全罗兹市的劳工党会议上，轻工业部长以一束玫瑰花奖赏玛利亚。她说：“在我们眼前，整个的波兰被我们的双手的工作改变样子了！我的小组对建设新波兰没有什么效劳，而且在我们的工厂中，莎曼和克鲁珈的小组现在也和我们一样干得好哩！”
    自然，玛利亚和她的小组的经验只是一个最容易的简单的例子，那些懒惰的工人附和的话和营利自肥的人有反动的作用，他们无时不在嘲笑前进的工人，怀疑他们的诚实的工作态度。这是一种新与旧的斗争。波兰进步工人的数量一直在增加着，就是他们在这斗争中取得胜利，未来的胜利也是属于他们的。

    我们和琴妮娜沿着宽广的，两旁有树木的派费瓦工场散步。她值过已班了，但仍穿着油渍污染的蓝外套。我们看见她胸前佩着一块闪烁在阳光下的优秀工人的青铜十字章。她说：“得一个勋章并不是难事，困难的却是消除每个人对一个女孩子干男人的职业的怀疑态度。”
    琴妮娜第一个礼拜完成了她的工作之百分之一百廿五，第二个礼拜完成了百分之三十。而现在已经有几十个女工在派费瓦工场上做工，没有人再奇怪或怀疑了。
    这个工场曾经花了很长的时间配制机车，经理米琪尔劝领班同志召集年青的工人要求他们自愿地来帮忙；这位领班的老工程师以为他的经验尚且不能胜任，所以怀疑地摇摇头。经理自动去找了一群经验少的年青工人，把困难告诉他们。“好！我们就装好它！”罗拉克一句话就决定了。三个月后，五一节庆祝会上，罗克拉得到领导装配小组的奖励，而机车内部机件的装配也不再是困难了。
    工人们就这样从废墟上发展了派费尔工场。这工场的四分之三曾被德寇破坏无遗，设备都被拆散或隐埋了，现在又重新找出来装置。派费尔现在的生产效能很高，德商派费尔时每周出十台机车的记录已经恢复了。
    这工场旁边耸立着一家新俱乐部，有一条工场独资修成的电车道通经工人住宅区，在那儿，有运动场、工人大学、电影院，黄昏时，临时的夏天公园中常传出歌声。文化宫也正在开始建造。被毁的罗克莱区三五年都不能修复，可是罗兹城却在我们眼前成长起来了。
