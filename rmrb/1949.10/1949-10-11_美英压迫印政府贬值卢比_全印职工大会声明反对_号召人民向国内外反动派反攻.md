Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 9th - TASS, Delhi, 7th: The All India Trade Union Congress, in its statement regarding the devaluation of the Indian Rupee, emphasized that this action by the Indian government was carried out under the orders of the British government, which in turn was implementing the devaluation of the pound under pressure from US imperialists. US imperialists are attempting to overcome their impending economic crisis by sacrificing the working class and laboring masses of Western European Marshall Plan countries, the Near East, the Middle East, and Southeast Asian colonies and dependencies.

The statement from the All India Trade Union Congress pointed out that devaluation will enable US imperialists to import strategic raw materials from capitalist countries at low prices, sell their weapons in these countries at extremely favorable prices, and ultimately interfere in the industries of Western European countries. Devaluation also means opening the door for the US to expand in Indonesia, Burma, Thailand, India, and other Southeast Asian countries. Its purpose is to intensify preparations for a new imperialist war.

However, the statement emphasized that devaluation will further sharpen the economic conflicts and commercial war between the two rival imperialist countries—the United States and Britain.

For the working class and laboring masses of capitalist countries, especially colonies and dependencies, devaluation means a further attack on their living standards and civil rights by the bourgeois reactionary governments of various countries, led by the United States.

The All India Trade Union Congress finally urged the Indian people to unite and launch a counterattack against British and American imperialists and their allies and running dogs in India.

　　美英压迫印政府贬值卢比
    全印职工大会声明反对
    号召人民向国内外反动派反攻
    【新华社北京九日电】塔斯社德里七日讯：全印职工大会在其关于印度卢比贬值的声明中着重指出：印度政府这一行动是按照英国政府的命令行事的，而英国又是在美帝国主义者的压力下实行了英镑贬值的。美帝国主义者力图牺牲西欧马歇尔化国家、近东、中东及东南亚殖民地与附属国的工人阶级和劳动群众，来克服其迫在眉睫的经济危机。
    全印职工大会的声明指出：贬值将使得美帝国主义者能够从资本主义各国以低廉的价格输入战略原料，以极有利的价格在这些国家销售他们的武器，最后并插手于西欧各国的工业。贬值还意味给美国在印尼、缅甸、泰国、印度及其他东南亚国家进行扩张大开方便之门。它的目的是加紧新的帝国主义战争的准备。
    然而，声明着重称：贬值将使两个敌对的帝国主义国家——美国和英国间的经济冲突与商业战更为尖锐。
    对于资本主义国家，特别是殖民地与附属国的工人阶级与劳动群众来说，贬值即意味着以美国为首的各国的资产阶级反动政府对他们的生活标准与公民权利的进一步进攻。
    全印职工大会最后力促印度人民团结起来，向英美帝国主义者及其在印度的同盟者与走狗发动反攻。
