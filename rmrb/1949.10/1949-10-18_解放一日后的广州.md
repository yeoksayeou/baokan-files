　　Guangzhou One Day After Liberation
　　Li Ying
　　Liberated Guangzhou has been completely engulfed in a frenzy of enthusiasm. All residents, except for a few fleeing bandit officials, are exceptionally stable, and the city is in good order.

　　On the evening of the 14th, when the bandit troops had not completely escaped, workers from various factories and students from various schools ventured out onto the streets to post slogans welcoming the People's Liberation Army. At night, they automatically removed all the street barricades, sandbags, and barbed wire. Citizens who had been kept awake all night by the sabotage and explosions of the Kuomintang bandit gang were now peering out of their windows, excitedly waiting for the victorious entry of the liberation army. The People's Liberation Army did arrive. Firecrackers were lit in the streets and alleys, making it even more lively than the Lunar New Year. Before dawn, many citizens went out to see the proclamations of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the leaflets on the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention. Workers from various factories and students and school police from Sun Yat-sen University, Republic University, Guangnan Middle School, and other schools formed teams to welcome the People's Liberation Army. Some school students, five or six days before liberation, had gathered in the classrooms, which had already suspended classes, to copy documents such as "On Coalition Government" and "On People's Democratic Dictatorship" and worked overnight to print propaganda materials. After liberation, they immediately took them out and distributed them. Students from Sun Yat-sen University, which had not started classes after the summer vacation, immediately dispatched two propaganda trucks when the People's Liberation Army entered the city, launching enthusiastic propaganda along Hui'ai Road, Xiguan, and Changdi. Wherever the People's Liberation Army passed, the citizens who thronged the streets shouted: "Welcome the People's Liberation Army!" "Long Live Chairman Mao!" Drums and gongs sounded in unison, and applause was endless. At this time, shop windows and doors, trees, and telephone poles were covered with five-star red flags. Clothing stores in Weixin Road and Danan Road were constantly rushing to make more new national flags.

　　The police continued to stand guard as usual after liberation. Buses continued to run as usual, without interruption. On the day of liberation, letters and packages resumed being sent and received to and from all liberated areas of the country. Telegrams and telephones never stopped. Although the Wuxianmen Power Plant, which supplies electricity to the city, had its cross-river power lines cut off when the Haizhu Bridge was blown up by the bandits, electricity was restored that night due to the active repair work of all outside line workers. Most of the large and small shops in the city were open as usual. The bandit silver dollar coupons had already been widely rejected by the citizens before liberation, and the Renminbi that entered the city with the People's Liberation Army was warmly welcomed by merchants and residents. Farmers in the suburbs, hearing that the city had been liberated, brought grain and vegetables into the city. An old peasant who brought cabbage into the city said to the reporter in Cantonese and gestures: "Now that you have come, we dare to come to the city to do business."

　　The crowds in the streets and alleys of the city showed unparalleled excitement. The workers in the railway factories were particularly happy and encouraged. The workers on the Yuehan Railway were looking for and wiping their furniture, preparing to go to work. The Guangsan Line can be operated after the official takeover. The workers on the line were overjoyed and expressed their determination to improve driving speed and safety to repay their liberators—the People's Liberation Army. The workers at the Xicun Cement Plant, which was controlled and squeezed by the bandit industry company, said: We have been bullied for so many years, and this time we can stand up straight. They arrived at the factory early that day, and everyone was planning how to improve equipment and technology to increase production. The men and women workers at the beverage factory and textile factory went to work as usual. They all expressed their willingness to welcome the People's Liberation Army and celebrate the liberation of Guangzhou with practical work achievements.

　　解放一日后的广州
    李  英
    解放后的广州已经完全卷入了热情的狂欢里。全市除部分匪帮官员仓皇逃跑外，所有居民都异常安定，市内秩序很好。
    十四日晚，当匪军尚未完全逃掉时，各工厂工人和各校学生即已分别冒险出动街头，遍贴欢迎人民解放军的标语。入夜，他们便自动将街头木桩、沙包、铁丝网完全撤除。曾因国民党匪帮破坏爆炸而整夜未眠的市民们，这时从窗口向大街张望着，兴奋地盼待着解放大军的胜利入城。解放军果然到来了。大街小巷都燃起鞭炮，过年也没有这样热闹。未等拂晓，很多市民便纷纷出门，争看解放军所张贴的中国人民解放军布告和三大纪律八项注意的传单。各工厂工人和中山大学、民国大学、广南中学等学校的学生和校警排成队伍，欢迎解放军。有的学校学生们早在解放以前五六天即紧集在已经停课的教室里争着抄写“论联合政府”及“论人民民主专政”等文件，并连夜赶印宣传品。解放后便立即拿出来散发。暑假后即未开课的中山大学的学生们，当解放军入城时，马上出动了两辆宣传卡车，沿惠爱路、西关、长堤一带展开热烈宣传。解放军所过之处，拥塞街巷的市民的高呼：“欢迎人民解放军！”“毛主席万岁！”锣鼓齐响，掌声不绝。此时，各商店门窗、树木、电杆上都挂满了五星红旗。维新路、大南路一带成衣店不停地赶制更多的新国旗。
    警察在解放后仍照常站岗。公共汽车照常行驶，迄未中断。信件包裹在解放当日，即恢复与全国解放区的收发寄递。电报电话从未停止。供应全市电灯的五仙门电力厂虽因海珠大桥被匪炸毁时将过河电线炸断，但由于全部外线工人的积极抢修，当晚即照常供电。市内各大小店铺，大部均照常营业。匪帮银元券在解放前即已为市民普遍拒用，随解放军入城的人民币则受到商民热烈欢迎。四郊农人听说城里已经解放，纷纷将粮食菜蔬挑进城里。一位挑白菜进城的老乡用广东话和手势对记者说：“你们来了，我们敢进城做生意了。”
    全市大街小巷拥挤的人群都表现出无比的兴奋。各铁路工厂的工人尤为欢欣鼓舞。粤汉路的工人们纷纷找寻和擦拭自己的家具，准备上工。广三线在正式接管后即可行驶。该路工人都欢天喜地，纷纷表示决心提高行车速率和安全来报答自己的解放者——人民解放军。在匪帮实业公司控制和压榨之下的西村士敏土厂工人说：我们受了多少年的欺侮，这回可挺起腰来了。当天他们很早便到了工厂工作，大家正在计划怎样改良设备，提高技术，来增加生产。饮料厂纺织厂的男女工人都照常上班。他们都表示要以实际工作的成绩来欢迎人民解放军和庆祝广州的解放。
