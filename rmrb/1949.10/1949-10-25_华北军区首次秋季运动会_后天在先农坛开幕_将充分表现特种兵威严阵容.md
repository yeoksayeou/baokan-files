The First Autumn Sports Meet of the North China Military Region
　　To Open at the Temple of Agriculture the Day After Tomorrow
    Will Fully Demonstrate the Majestic Formation of Special Forces
    [Our Newspaper] The first autumn sports meet of the North China Military Region, celebrating the birth of the New China, is scheduled to open on the 27th at the Temple of Agriculture stadium in Beijing. There will be a large dance composed of more than 240 people in nineteen wonderful scenes as a gift to the New China. The entire content of this conference runs through the spirit of "Building special forces to defend the New China." Among them is a large tank stacked by forty-eight people, proceeding in proud and brisk military music, symbolizing the growth of China's young tank force. Other dances, such as "Anti-Aircraft Guns Jointly Attacking Airplanes" and "Tank Dance," are not only realistic dances, but also beautiful patterned paintings. As for the scenes of soldiers' lives such as baseball and wooden horses, they are even more vivid and lively. In short, every action depicts the special colors of special forces. Since the 17th, the performing arts troupe and soldiers have been rehearsing together at Ditan. Although it has only been six days, this complicated dance has been completed. During the rehearsal, some comrades sprained their feet and broke their hands, but in the blink of an eye they had already run into the crowd of dancers. The soldiers all believe that the sports meet is a major event for the special forces, and they must show their strength on the sports field.

　　华北军区首次秋季运动会
  　后天在先农坛开幕
    将充分表现特种兵威严阵容
    【本报讯】庆祝新中国诞生的华北军区第一次秋季运动大会，定廿七日在北京市先农坛运动场开幕。有以二百四十多人、十九个精彩场面组成的大舞蹈作为对新中国的献礼。此次大会的全部内容贯穿着“建设特种兵保卫新中国”的精神。其中有四十八人叠砌的大坦克，在自豪、轻快的军乐中进行，象征着中国年青的坦克部队的成长。其他如“高射炮合击飞机”和“坦克舞”，都不仅是写实的舞蹈，而且是美丽的图案画。至于棒球、木马等战士生活的场面，更是生动活泼。总之，每一动作都是描写了特种兵的特殊色彩。自十七日起由文工团和战士们在地坛合作排练，时虽只有六天，但已经将这复杂的舞蹈完成了。在排练当中，有些同志跌拐了脚，碰破了手，可是一转眼早就跑到舞蹈的人群里去了。战士们都认为运动会是特种兵部队的大事件，一定要在运动场上显示一下自己的力量。
