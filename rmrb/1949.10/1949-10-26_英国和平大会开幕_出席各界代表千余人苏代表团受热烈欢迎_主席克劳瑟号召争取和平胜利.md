Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 25th: According to TASS, London: The first British Peace Congress opened on October 22nd at the Hammersmith Town Hall in London. Over 1,200 representatives and guests from all walks of life in Britain attended. On the rostrum were members of the British Peace Committee and foreign guests, including members of the Soviet delegation of cultural and scientific workers—Volgin, Tikina, and Surkov, who were warmly welcomed. Crowther, Chairman of the British Peace Committee, said in his opening speech: "The presence of guests at today's conference reminds us that warriors for peace are not isolated anywhere. Eight hundred million men and women in the world have organized themselves. The cause of peace is invincible. The first British Peace Congress includes 1,090 delegates from all over Britain, representing 540 organizations. The task of the congress is to strive for the victory of peace. The majority of the British people want peace, but they are exposed to false propaganda. Today, it is almost impossible to obtain a fair discussion of the issue of peace in the newspapers or on the radio in Britain. For example, on the issue of atomic energy, we have been hearing for years that Soviet scientists would not be able to solve the problem of atomic energy radiation before 1952. The public statement made by an important Soviet politician on this issue in 1947 was dismissed as a bluff and ignored. Now, everyone who believes that peace must be won by action, not just by prayer, must admit that the Soviet Union's mastery of atomic energy is one of the greatest concrete facts in building peace. (Thunderous applause) Even the most reckless adventurers will think twice before throwing an atomic bomb at controllers who also possess atomic bombs. We need to build a peace movement that can fight for its beliefs. We are not on the defensive. We are on the offensive for peace." (Applause)

　　Wood Condemns US-British Warmongers, Advocates Friendship with China and the Soviet Union

　　John Wood, Vice-Chairman of the Scottish Miners' Union, said in his speech: "All reactionaries are colluding with Wall Street in an attempt to stop the progress of socialism."

　　He expressed indignation that some people in the British labor movement actually came out to oppose the Soviet Union, thereby effectively becoming allies of the American reactionaries. Wood said: "Warriors for peace are determined to deal with imperialist warmongers, firmly believing that the power of peace is stronger than the power of war. The task of the British Peace Congress is to lay the foundation for peace in every town and village in Britain. Some people tell the British people that they must agree to lower their living standards due to the economic crisis, but in a time called peace, Britain spends nearly 800 million pounds a year preparing for war. That's an average of 15 pounds per person. This is an asylum economy. Britain's overseas military obligations appear to be reaching 180 million pounds this year. It can be seen that if British troops stationed abroad are recalled, this huge sum of money can be saved, and British lives can be preserved. Moreover, the increased labor force due to army demobilization can produce many needed things and improve the standard of living. If millions of pounds are used to maintain peace instead of being spent on destructive weapons, it would not only be more humane but also greatly benefit the country. (Applause) American financial capitalists tell us that our enemy is the Soviet Union. But do we, the ordinary British people, really have such fear of the Soviet Union? (The crowd shouted: "No!") The Soviet people do not want war. The British people need not fear the Soviet people, whose struggle is to rebuild their ravaged homeland and do not want to waste human efforts on war preparations. The Soviet Union's response to malicious attacks is to put forward disarmament proposals in the United Nations."

　　At this point, Wood called for extending a hand of friendship to the new People's China, because the Chinese people are another valuable partner in the struggle for peace.

　　Wood called for friendship with the Soviet Union and urged all peace advocates to work together, convinced that their cause will succeed.

　　Crowther read out many congratulatory telegrams, including those from Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress, from Finnish and Hungarian democratic groups, from British groups, and from individuals, including the American novelist Fast, who was prevented from attending the conference by the American authorities. The conference then passed a resolution supporting "American comrades who are fighting for peace and justice," and passed a resolution addressed to the French Ministry of the Interior, demanding that the French government immediately restore Aragon's civil rights.

　　Soviet Peace Committee Representative Volgin Congratulates the Congress

　　The chairman of the congress invited Volgin, Vice-President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, to speak, and he congratulated the congress on behalf of the Soviet Peace Committee. His speech was listened to with great attention and was interrupted from time to time by stormy applause. Volgin emphasized that all the people of the Soviet Union are staunch supporters of peace. He said: "Our country has no exploiting classes, and no one is interested in the cheap labor of colonial and semi-colonial slaves or in new investment areas. Our country is rich, thanks to its natural resources, the strength and ability of its working people, and its advanced revolutionary theory." Volgin cited astonishing and convincing examples to illustrate the great achievements of the Soviet people after the war. Volgin also said: "We oppose war not out of fear, we do not need war. We cherish the lives of ordinary people, their peaceful creative efforts, which have created such wonderful things beneficial to mankind. We cherish the long-standing achievements of human culture, which war will inevitably lose. We cherish the opportunity we won in the war to build a bright future for our country. It is for this reason that the Soviet people stand at the forefront of the great peace movement, which is growing in strength in all countries around the world." Finally, Volgin pointed out that the British Peace Congress is an important step in the development of the general movement of the British people towards building lasting peace, and expressed his firm belief that the consolidation of friendship between the British and Soviet peoples is the best guarantee of world peace.

　　Also speaking at the conference was Grandi, who congratulated the conference on behalf of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress, and Mrs. Ilanit, who congratulated the conference on behalf of the Israeli Peace Committee.

　　英国和平大会开幕　
    出席各界代表千余人苏代表团受热烈欢迎 
    主席克劳瑟号召争取和平胜利
    【新华社北京二十五日电】据塔斯社伦敦讯：英国和平大会第一届大会已于十月二十二日在伦敦哈莫斯密斯大厅开幕，出席者有英国各界代表与来宾一千二百人。主席台上有英国和平委员会的委员与外国来宾，其中包括苏联文化与科学工作者代表团的团员——沃尔金、蒂基娜及苏尔科夫等，他们受到了极其热烈的欢迎。英国和平委员会主席克劳瑟在开幕词中说：“有来宾出席今天的大会这一点，提醒我们，争取和平的战士任何地方都不是孤立的。世界上八万万男女已组织起来。和平的事业是不可挫败的。英国第一届和平大会包括来自英国各地的一千零九十名代表，代表五百四十个团体。大会的任务便是争取和平的胜利。大多数英国人民都要和平，但是他们所接触的却都是虚假的宣传。今天在英国想求得在报纸上或广播中对和平问题作公正的讨论几乎是不可能的。譬如原子能问题，几年来我们就听到说，苏联的科学家在一九五二年之前解决不了原子能放射的问题。苏联重要政治家在一九四七年关于这一问题的公开声明，被认为是虚张声势而置若罔闻。现在，每个相信必须以行动而不仅仅是以祈祷来赢得和平的人必须承认，苏联的掌握原子能乃是缔造和平的最伟大的具体事实之一。（掌声雷动）就是最狂妄的冒险家，在他们向同样拥有原子弹的控制者投出原子弹之前，也要思索再三。我们需要建立能够为其信仰而战斗的和平运动。我们不是处于守势。我们是处于争取和平的攻势。”（鼓掌）
    伍德谴责美英战贩  主张与中苏友好
    苏格兰矿工工会副主席约翰·伍德在演讲中说：“一切反动分子都正在与华尔街勾结，企图阻止社会主义的前进”。
    他对于英国劳工运动中竟有些人出而反对苏联，从而实际上成为美国反动派的同盟者，表示愤慨。伍德说：“争和平的战士，决心对付帝国主义战争贩子，深信和平的力量比战争的力量强大。英国和平大会的任务便是在英国的每一城镇乡村，奠定和平的基础。有人告诉英国人民说，由于经济危机，他们必须同意降低生活水平，但是，在号称和平的时期，英国却在每年花费近八亿英镑于准备战争。每人平均要摊到十五英镑。这是疯人院的节约。英国的海外军事义务，看来今年要达到一亿八千万镑。可见只要召回英国在海外的驻军，便能够节省这笔巨款的消费和保存英国人的生命。而且，由于军队复员而增加的劳动力，可以生产许多所需要的东西，提高生活水平。如果成千百万的英镑用于保持和平，而不是用在毁灭性的武器上，就不仅要人道得多，而且也大大有利于国家。（鼓掌）美国金融资本家告诉我们说：我们的敌人是苏联。但是我们英国的普通老百姓对苏联真有这种恐惧吗？（群众喊声：“不！”）。苏联人民不想战争。英国人民无须害怕苏联人民，他们的斗争是为重建被蹂躏的国土，不想浪费人类的努力于战争准备。苏联对于恶意的攻击的答复，是在联合国提出裁军建议。”
    至此，伍德要求向新的人民中国伸出友谊的手，因为中国人民是和平斗争中另一个可贵的伙伴。
    伍德要求对苏友好，力促一切和平拥护者合力奋斗，确信他们的事业将获成功。
    克劳瑟宣读许多祝贺电信，其中包括来自世界和平大会常设委员会主席约里奥·居礼的，来自芬兰与匈牙利民主团体的，来自英国团体与来自个人的，其中包括美国小说家法斯特，他为美国当局所阻而未能出席大会。大会继通过决议，支持“为和平和正义而战的美国同志”，并通过致法国内政部的决议，要求法国政府立即恢复阿拉贡的公民权利。
    苏联和平委会代表  沃尔金向大会致贺
    大会主席邀请苏联科学院副院长沃尔金发言，他代表苏联和平委员会向大会致贺。他的讲演受到深切注意，并时时被暴风雨似的掌声所阻断。沃尔金强调苏联全体人民都是始终不渝的和平支持者。他说：“我国没有剥削阶级，没有人会对殖民地奴隶半奴隶的廉价劳动以及对新的投资地区感到兴趣。我们的国家是富裕的，这是由于它的天然资源，由于它的劳动人民的力量和能力，由于它的前进的革命理论。”沃尔金援引惊人的、令人信服的例子，说明苏联人民战后的巨大成就。沃尔金又说：“我们反对战争不是因为恐惧，我们不需要战争。我们珍爱普通老百姓的生活，他们的和平的创造性努力，创造了这样神奇的有益人类的事物。我们珍爱人类文化的悠久成就，战争将不可避免地使它们损失。我们珍爱我们在战争中赢得的建设我国的光明未来的机会。就是因为这个原故苏联人民站在伟大的和平运动的最前列，这一运动正在全世界上一切国家中日益壮大”。最后，沃尔金指出英国和平大会是英国人民走向建设持久和平的总运动的发展中的重要一步，表示深信英苏人民友谊的巩固是世界和平的最好保证。
    在大会上发言的尚有格兰弟，他代表世界和平大会常设委员会向大会致贺，此外并有伊兰尼特夫人代表以色列和平委员会向大会致贺。
