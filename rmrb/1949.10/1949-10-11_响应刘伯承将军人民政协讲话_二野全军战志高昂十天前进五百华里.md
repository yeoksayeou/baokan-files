Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, October 6th: General Liu Bocheng's speech at the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has become the action slogan for all commanders and soldiers of the Second Field Army. The commanders and soldiers have stated one after another: "Commander Liu has made a guarantee to the People's Political Consultative Conference: to completely eliminate the remnants of the enemy in the Southwest and South China, and liberate all of China. We must also make a guarantee to Commander Liu to resolutely fulfill his call." The day after Commander Liu addressed the People's Political Consultative Conference (September 24th), a unit of the Second Field Army crossed the Dayu Mountains, the "new defense line" of the Chiang bandits' last struggle, and captured Nanxiong, the first county town in northern Guangdong. Immediately following this, on the 25th, they captured Shixing, southwest of Nanxiong, and approached Qujiang (Shaozhou), a strategic point in northern Guangdong on the Yuehan Railway. On the 29th, they once again liberated Rucheng County, on the border of Hunan, Guangdong, and Jiangxi provinces. The Second Field Army's southward advance force braved the early autumn drizzle, climbing mountains and wading through rivers, marching day and night in paddy fields and muddy roads, but their morale was high, and the entire army was full of fighting spirit. All the commanders and soldiers of a certain army, the vanguard force advancing towards Guangdong, sent a special telegram to Chairman Mao, Vice Chairmen Zhu, Liu, Song, Li, Zhang, and Gao, saying: "We wholeheartedly support the leadership of the Central People's Government headed by Chairman Mao, resolutely implement Commander-in-Chief Zhu's orders, and quickly eliminate the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries. We will liberate all the unliberated territories, accelerate our advance, liberate Guangzhou, liberate Guangdong and Guangxi, liberate the Great Southwest, build a national defense army, and strive to consolidate the national defense of our great People's Republic!" In the ten days of the People's Political Consultative Conference, this unit has advanced approximately 500 li, and is now continuing to carry out the task of advancing and annihilating the remaining enemies with even greater combat enthusiasm.
