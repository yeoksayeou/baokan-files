　　Forging Movie Tickets to Evade Taxes
  　Red Building and Golden City Cinemas Penalized
  　Privately Engraved Tax Bureau Seal Handed Over to the Court for Interrogation
    [Beijing News] The Red Building and Golden City cinemas in this city were found to have forged tax bureau seals and privately printed movie tickets to evade taxes, and have been investigated by the tax bureau. This kind of behavior not only hinders tax administration but also violates criminal law. In addition to educating the relevant personnel, ordering them to confess and pay the evaded taxes, the City Tax Bureau has handed over the privately engraved tax bureau seal portion to the court for interrogation yesterday.
    In order to prevent cinemas from taking advantage of holidays to engage in malfeasance, the Second Tax Bureau conducted a surprise inspection of entertainment venues within its jurisdiction during the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday (October 6th). When inspecting the Red Building Cinema on South Street, Xisi Archway, the staff of the cinema appeared very flustered. All the tickets for the first showing were confiscated. After two days of research, it was discovered that the tax bureau stamp on the tickets did not match the genuine ones. The person in charge of the cinema was summoned for questioning. According to them, this matter was done by the ticket seller Zhu Qiqian and the accountants You Xingzhong and Zhang Xingqiao, who privately engraved the City Tax Bureau's entertainment tax inspection stamp and printed fake tickets, which were sold in small quantities among genuine tickets during each showing, and 5,191 tickets have been sold. All the fake tickets and stamps were burned after the incident. The Second Tax Bureau reported the case to the City Tax Bureau because the case was serious. After repeated talks and investigations, regardless of whether the mastermind was the manager or the staff, it was confirmed that the cinema had privately engraved the seal and evaded taxes. It was ordered to provide a guarantee, and the evaded tax portion was ordered to be paid: entertainment tax of 161,699 yuan, stamp tax of 26,941 yuan, and a fine of one time the entertainment tax and five times the stamp tax, totaling 296,404 yuan. The matter of privately engraving the tax bureau seal is a judicial matter and will be handed over to the court for legal handling.
    The Golden City Cinema was also found to have privately engraved seals and manufactured fake tickets by the Fourth Tax Bureau on the 8th of this month. All the fake tickets and seals have been handed over, and a guarantee has been made. A total of 100 fake movie tickets were sold, and they were ordered to pay entertainment tax of 7,969 yuan and stamp tax of 1,212 yuan, plus a fine of two times the entertainment tax and forty times the stamp tax, totaling 48,480 yuan; the part of privately engraving government seals has been sent to the court for interrogation.
