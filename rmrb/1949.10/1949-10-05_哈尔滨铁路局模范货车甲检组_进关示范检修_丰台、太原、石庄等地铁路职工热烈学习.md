　　Harbin Railway Bureau Model Freight Car A-Inspection Team
  　Demonstrates Inspection and Repair in Guan
    Railway Workers in Fengtai, Taiyuan, Shijiazhuang and Other Places Enthusiastically Learn
    [Our Newspaper] The Model Freight Car A-Inspection Team of the Harbin Railway Bureau in Northeast China came to various important bureaus and sections within Guan (i.e. inside the Shanhaiguan Pass) in the middle of last month to hold vehicle inspection and repair demonstrations to exchange experiences. They have successively conducted demonstration inspections and repairs in Fengtai, Taiyuan, Shijiazhuang and other places, with good results. The railway construction work in Northeast China has achieved new successes due to learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. At the National Locomotive Affairs Conference in July, representatives from within Guan hoped to get help from them. After approval by the Military Commission's Ministry of Railways, the Harbin sent a model A-Inspection team to Guan to exchange experiences. The A-Inspection demonstration was first held at the Fengtai Vehicle Inspection Section, and relevant employee representatives from Nankou, Beijing, Zhangjiakou and other places also went to observe and learn. They used the standard time to conduct A-inspection of a freight car. At the Tongpu North Station in Taiyuan, they completed the A-inspection work of car "×-1" in 50 minutes and 40 seconds (including carpentry and masonry time), which was 13 minutes and 20 seconds less than the time stipulated by the Ministry of Railways. In Shijiazhuang, it took five hours to complete the A-inspection work of open car No. 2044, a 30-ton car (usually it takes six hours), which won praise from more than 250 employees who visited the site. The team members are all young people (19 to 23 years old), with the longest road age of only one year, and the shortest only nine months, but their skills are extremely proficient. The main characteristics of their work are: (1) Strict organization, correct division of labor, and truly achieved personal responsibility system; (2) Good work sequence, careful planning, and no disorder at all; (3) Good cooperation with each other, and joint labor is implemented. In addition, their rigorous work attitude and attention to saving materials (such as when scraping the bearing shells, specially made tin boxes are used to hold the tungsten shavings scraped off to avoid waste on the ground) have won praise from employees in various places and inspired everyone's enthusiasm for learning. After the demonstration and inspection in North China, the team will go to Shanghai and other places to demonstrate.

　　哈尔滨铁路局模范货车甲检组
  　进关示范检修
    丰台、太原、石庄等地铁路职工热烈学习
    【本报讯】东北哈尔滨铁路局模范货车甲检组，于上月中旬来关内各重要局段举行车辆检修示范，以交流经验。已先后在丰台、太原、石家庄等处作示范检修，成绩良好。东北铁路建设工作因学习了苏联的先进经验，有了新的成就，七月间全国机务会议上，关内各代表希望能从他们获得帮助。后经军委铁道部核准，由哈尔滨派模范甲检组来关内交流经验。甲检示范首先在丰台检车段举行，南口、北京、张家口等地有关职工代表亦前往观摩学习。他们以标准时间甲检一辆货车。在太原同蒲北站，他们以五十点零四十分钟时间（木石工时间在内）即完成了甲检“×一”号车工作，较铁道部规定时间少十三点二十分。在石家庄，以五点钟时间完成二○四四号三十吨敞车的甲检工作（通常需六小时），获得全场参观的二百五十余名职工的赞扬。该组组员都是青年（十九岁至二十三岁），路龄最长的只一年，短的仅九个月，但技术却极熟练。他们工作的主要特点是：（一）组织严密，分工正确，真正做到了个人负责制；（二）工作顺序好，计划周密，一点也不紊乱；（三）相互配合好，实行了联合劳动。此外，他们谨严的工作态度和注意节省材料（如刮瓦架子（轴瓦）时，特制洋铁盒以承接刮下来的钨金屑，以免落地浪费），深得各地职工的赞扬，鼓舞了大家学习的情绪。该组在华北各地示范检修完毕后，将转赴上海等地示范。
