　　The Soviet Delegation
    Visits Chinese Ancient Art Exhibition
    Fyodorov Discusses Soviet Art Education Experience
    [By Our Newspaper] On the morning of October 10th, the Soviet Cultural, Artistic, and Scientific Workers Delegation visited the "Chinese Ancient Art and Modern Woodcut New Year Pictures" exhibition held at the National Beijing Art College, and was warmly welcomed by the students of the Art College. The students lined up and shouted "Long Live Stalin!" "Long Live Chairman Mao!" "Long Live Sino-Soviet Friendship!" and requested Comrade Fadeyev, the head of the delegation, to speak. In his speech, Comrade Fadeyev warmly congratulated the young Chinese art workers for having more achievements and greater development prospects in the construction of New China, and expressed his infinite pleasure at seeing the rebirth of Chinese art. Before leaving, he repeatedly thanked Principal Xu and all the students of the Art College.
    [By Our Newspaper] The National Artists Association and the National Art College jointly invited Fyodorov, the art representative of the Soviet Cultural, Artistic, and Scientific Workers Delegation and a famous Soviet painter, to attend an art symposium at 2 p.m. on October 10th. Those present included Xu Beihong, Ye Qianyu, Cai Ruohong, Hu Yichuan, Wu Zuoren, Wang Chaowen, Li Hua, Wang Shikui, Liu Jianan, and others, totaling more than twenty people. During the meeting, Fyodorov earnestly answered several questions raised in writing by the Art College. The first part of the questions concerned the system and teaching methods of Soviet art academies. Fyodorov gave a detailed introduction to the administrative, teaching, and research organizations of Soviet art academies, saying that Soviet art teaching emphasizes realism. In painting teaching, attention is paid to both sketching, with strict training for students to develop modeling skills, and composition practice, to develop creative skills. The progress and requirements of art teaching are unified, but the methods of achieving this progress and these requirements vary depending on the professor. The ideological education of Soviet art students can be obtained from three aspects: courses, lectures, and Marxist-Leninist study groups. Stalin's "Problems of Leninism" is the basic learning material for professors. Secondly, Fyodorov expressed his thoughts on the "Chinese Ancient Art and Modern Woodcut New Year Pictures Exhibition" organized by the Art College and the National Artists Association, pointing out that artists should not only be good at selecting modern themes in their creations, but also endow these themes with national characteristics. Finally, everyone invited him to talk about the process of creating the Stalingrad Defense War Painting Collection. He said that Stalingrad was his hometown, and he had painted this city in his youth. Before the Battle of Stalingrad, he was in Moscow, and he returned there not long before the siege. He participated in the entire defense battle and followed the troops defending Stalingrad into Berlin. He made many portraits and sketches of the heroes in the Patriotic War, and their signatures and the dates and locations of the paintings are still on these works, which became the material for his later creations. The symposium ended at 6 p.m.

　　苏联代表团
    参观中国古代美展
    费诺格诺夫谈苏联美术教学经验
    【本报讯】十日上午九时，苏联文化艺术科学工作者代表团赴国立北京艺专参观艺专及全国美术工作者协会主办之“中国古代美术及近代木刻年画”展览会，受到艺专同学们的热烈欢迎，同学们排队高呼“斯大林万岁”！“毛主席万岁”！“中苏友好万岁”！并要求代表团团长法捷耶夫先生讲话。法捷耶夫先生在讲话中热忱地祝贺中国的青年艺术工作者在新中国的建设中将有更多的成就和更大的发展前途，并深以看见中国艺术的新生而感到无限愉快。临行时并再三向艺专徐校长及全体同学致谢。
    【本报讯】全国美协与国立艺专于十日下午二时联合邀请苏联文化艺术科学工作者代表团美术代表——苏联名画家费诺格诺夫出席美术座谈会，与会者有徐悲鸿、叶浅予、蔡若虹、胡一川、吴作人、王朝闻、李桦、王式廓、刘建庵等二十余人。席间即由费诺格诺夫对艺专目前书面提出的几个问题恳切作答。该问题的第一部分为苏联美术学院的制度与教学方法。费诺格诺夫详尽的介绍了苏联美术学院的行政教学组织与研究组织，并谓：苏联美术教学着重写实。在绘画教学中一方面注意素描，对学生施行严格的训练以养成造型的技能；同时亦注意构图实习，以养成创作的技能。美术教学的进度与要求是统一的，但如何达成这个进度与要求的方法则因教授者的不同而各异。苏联美术学生的思想教育可以从课程、讲演与马列主义研究小组三方面获得。斯大林著的“列宁主义问题”是教授们基本学习材料。其次费诺格诺夫对艺专及全国美协主办的“中国古代美术及近代木刻年画展览会”发表感想，指出：美术家在创作中不仅要善于选择现代的题材，而且要赋予这题材以民族的特色。最后大家邀请他谈一谈创作斯大林格勒保卫战争画集的经过。他说：斯大林格勒是他的故乡，在年青时代，他即画了这个城市。斯大林格勒保卫战之前，他在莫斯科，他是在围城不久之前才回到那里去的。他参加了整个的保卫战，并随着保卫斯大林格勒的军队进入柏林。他对爱国战争中的勇士们曾作了许多画像和写生，至今在这些作品上还留着他们的签字与作画的日子与地点，这些作品，便成了他以后创作的素材。座谈至六时始散。
