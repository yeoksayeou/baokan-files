　　The Soviet peasants have also achieved considerable brilliant results. Millions of rural laborers are successfully implementing the historic resolution of the February Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), ensuring the continuous rise of the socialist economy.

　　A bumper harvest has been achieved in the fields of the Soviet Union this year, and every Soviet person knows very well that this is primarily the result of improving the culture of socialist agriculture and the increasingly improved technical equipment of collective farms and state farms. The Party and the government have given great assistance to the peasants of collective farms. The supply of the latest agricultural machinery to collective farms and agricultural machinery stations has increased significantly.

　　In many regions of the Soviet Union, electric tractors have already begun to be mastered this year. The application of this type of tractor will significantly accelerate the production of field work and reduce the value of field work. The struggle for agricultural electrification is gradually becoming one of the most important tasks of the communist transformation of the countryside. In twenty-seven districts of the Moscow Province, the comprehensive electrification of agriculture has been completed, and nearly 4,500 collective farms have been electrified here.

　　The Soviet peasants are striving to complete the state's agricultural product procurement work with the best quality indicators in a shorter period of time, which is the best manifestation of the Soviet peasants' patriotism. The whole country is enthusiastically welcoming the peasants of the various Union Republics and Autonomous Republics, and various border areas and provinces, who are reporting to Comrade Stalin on the early completion of the state's food procurement plan.

　　The laborers of socialist agriculture have completely fulfilled the grain delivery plan to the state, and are now automatically guaranteeing the extra-plan delivery of large quantities of grain. For example, the fact that the Stavropol region has guaranteed to deliver an extra 3 million poods of grain is sufficient to prove this point.

　　The peasants of collective farms have achieved remarkable success in completing the cause resolved by the Soviet State Council and the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) regarding the field protection forest belt plan. In the Kharkiv Province, the majority of collective farms have now exceeded the completion of the tree planting plan. In the Stalingrad Province, this year's spring afforestation plan has been over-fulfilled by more than two times. There, forest belts have been planted on an area of more than 3,600 hectares, and nearly 150 hectares of forest nurseries have been established. The Stalin plan for transforming nature and the smooth progress of this plan reflects the great superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system.

　　The historic resolution made by the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet government on the three-year plan for developing animal husbandry put forward the task of producing sufficient feed products and raw materials for light industry in front of all collective farm peasants. On the basis of the three-year plan, a movement to strive for the rapid development of animal husbandry in collective farms and state farms is now unfolding. Preliminary results have been achieved in the development of animal husbandry. The number of public livestock in collective farms has increased in one year: cattle by 20 percent, pigs by 79 percent, and sheep by 11 percent.

　　In the collective farm villages, there have appeared extraordinary high-yield experts, heroes of socialist labor, people that the capitalist world does not and cannot know, because in the capitalist world, forced slave labor is a heavy burden for laborers.

　　Collective farms with millions of fortunes in the countryside, the high incomes of individual collective farm members, radios, movies, nurseries, lectures, cars, etc. are no longer rare things for the Soviet people. They have forgotten poverty and ignorance. Even let us take the youngest collective farm as an example. For example, the Budyonny Collective Farm in the Transcarpathian Province. It has only existed for a year, but this collective farm has brought about such a huge change in the economy of the local peasants! One of the members of this collective farm, Arun Kochu, a poor peasant who used to work for landlords, has already received an advance payment of 85 poods of grain this year. In addition to money, each labor day will also receive 6 kilograms of grain and a lot of potatoes, vegetables, grapes, hay, etc. In the pre-Soviet period, he could not even have imagined such a situation. A year of collective labor has brought great changes not only to the economy of the Transcarpathian peasants, but also to their lives.

　　Soviet culture has reached unprecedented development. In the three years since the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) announced its historic resolution on ideological issues, many extraordinary literary works, films, dramas, theories, paintings, and music have been created that educate the Soviet people with high patriotism and love for their socialist motherland.

　　Soviet scholars, designers, inventors, and advanced Stakhanovite workers who have won the Stalin Prize are contributing their labor and knowledge to the cause of building communism. Soviet scholars mastered the secrets of atomic weapons as early as 1947. The Soviet Union not only discovered the secret of atomic energy, but is also successfully solving the task of utilizing atomic energy for the needs of the national economy. This greatest scientific discovery further increases the glory of the Soviet Union, consolidates the Soviet Union's military and economic power, and accelerates the Soviet Union's march towards communism. In the Soviet Union, dozens of new machines, lathes, and automatic machines that can greatly improve labor productivity have been created recently, for example, the designer Milia created a new press for brick making with high productivity. A street sweeper was created that can replace the labor of two hundred people. A fast method of manufacturing locomotives has been mastered, as a result, the time for manufacturing locomotives has been reduced by 2.2 times.

　　What is the source of these extraordinary labor achievements of the Soviet people?

　　The Soviet social and state system is an endless source of great creativity for the people. It is it that, after eliminating all exploitation, guarantees every Soviet person all the conditions to freely develop their spiritual and physical strength. The friendship of the Soviet nationalities, the vigorous Soviet patriotism, and the unity of Soviet socio-political morality - these are the forces that drive the Soviet Union forward.

　　The Lenin-Stalin Party is the leading and guiding force of communist construction. Under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party and the great Stalin, the Soviet people are correctly and confidently moving towards communism.

　　苏联人民争取先期完成战后五年计划的爱国斗争
    苏联农民也达到了不小的光辉成绩。数百万乡村劳动者，顺利执行着联共（布）党中央二月全会的历史性决议，保证了社会主义经济的不断上升。
    在苏联的田野上，今年达成了丰收，每一苏联人都很好地知道：这首先是提高社会主义农业文化和愈益改善集体农庄与国营农场技术装备的结果。党与政府给了集体农庄的农民以巨大帮助。对于集体农庄和农业机器站最新农业机器的供给显著增加了。
    在苏联许多区中，今年已经开始掌握电气拖拉机，这种拖拉机的应用将显著加速田野工作的生产和缩小田野工作的价值。争取农业电气化的斗争，逐渐在成为共产主义改造农村的最重要的任务之一。在莫斯科省的二十七个区中，已经完成了农业的全面电气化，这里将近四千五百个集体农庄业已电气化。
    苏联农民竭力于更短期内以最好的质量指标完成国家的农产品收购工作，这是苏联农民爱国主义的最好显示。全国刻正兴高彩烈地欢迎各盟员共和国和各自治共和国，各边区和各省的农民向斯大林同志报告关于先期完成国家的食粮收购计划。
    社会主义农业的劳动者，已全部完成对国家的缴粮计划，刻正自动保证超计划缴纳大量的粮食。例如只说到斯达维罗宝里边区已保证要超计划纳粮三百万普特就可充分证明这一点。
    集体农庄的农民，在完成苏联国务院和联共（布）党中央关于田地防御林带计划所决议这一事业中达到了显著成绩。在哈尔科夫省，多数集体农庄现已超过完成植树计划。在斯大林格勒省，今年的春季植林计划曾超过完成两倍以上。那里在面积达三千六百公顷以上的土地上，业已植成森林地带，并建立了将近一百五十公顷的林木苗圃。改造自然的斯大林计划和这一计划的顺利进行，反映了社会主义制度对于资本主义制度的伟大优越性。
    布尔什维克党和苏联政府关于发展牧畜业三年计划所作历史性决议，在全体集体农庄的农民面前提出了生产充足的饲料产品和轻工业原料的任务。在三年计划的基础上刻正展开争取迅速发展集体农庄与国营农场牧畜业的运动。现已达到了发展牧畜业的初步结果。集体农庄公共牲畜的头数在一年中增加了：牛百分之二十、猪百分之七十九、羊百分之十一。
    在集体农庄的乡村中，出现了非凡的高等收获能手，社会主义劳动英雄，资本主义世界从不知道和不能够知道的人们，因为在资本主义世界强制的奴隶劳动是劳动者的严重负担。
    乡村中百万财富的集体农庄，个别集体农庄庄员的高额收入、无线电、电影、托儿所、讲座、汽车等已不是苏联人所稀罕的事情。他们已经忘记了贫困和愚昧无知。甚至请你们拿最年青的集体农庄来看。比如说外喀尔巴阡省的布琼尼集体农庄。它的存在一共才有一年，然而该集体农庄却使此地农民的经济发生了如何巨大的变化呵！这一集体农庄的成员之一，过去替地主工作的贫农阿伦、科褚，今年已经得到了八十五普特谷物的预支款，除钱之外每个劳动日还将得到六公斤谷物和许多土豆子、蔬菜、葡萄、干草等。在苏维埃以前的时期，甚至他都不能够推想到这种类似情况。集体劳动的一年，不仅给外喀尔巴阡农民的经济，而且也给他们的生活带来了很大的变化。
    苏联文化达到了空前的发展。联共（布）党中央在思想问题方面公布了历史性决议后的三年中，创作了许多非凡的、以高度爱国主义和热爱自己社会主义祖国教育苏联人民的文学作品，影片、戏剧理论、绘画和音乐。
    荣获斯大林奖金的苏联学者、设计家、发明家、先进斯达汉诺夫工作者，正把自己的劳动与知识贡献给建设共产主义的事业。苏联学者早在一九四七年就已掌握了原子武器的秘密。苏联不仅发现了原子能的秘密，而且也正在顺利解决为国民经济需要利用原子能这一任务。这一最伟大的科学发现，更加增加着苏联的光荣、巩固着苏联的军事经济威力、加速着苏联向共产主义的迈进。在苏联，于最近时期创造了数十架新的能够大大提高劳动生产率的机器、车床和联动机，例如设计者米利亚创造了用以造砖的具有高度生产力的新压榨机。创造了可代替二百人劳动的扫街机。掌握了制造机车的快速方法，结果制造机车的时间缩短了二点二倍。
    苏联人民这些非凡的劳动功迹之源泉何在呢？
    苏联的社会与国家制度就是滋养人民伟大创造力的无尽源泉。就是它，在消灭了一切剥削后保证每一苏联人获得了能够自由发展其精神力量与体力的一切条件。苏联各民族的友谊、生气勃勃的苏维埃爱国主义、苏维埃社会政治道德的统一——这就是推动苏联向前发展的那些力量。
    列宁——斯大林党，是共产主义建设的领导与指导力量。在布尔什维克党和伟大斯大林的领导下，苏联人民正确信地走向共产主义。
