Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 15th - Comprehensive TASS report: Soviet agricultural electrification is widely developed. Collective farms in the Moscow region are currently implementing a huge electrification plan. In the past six months, 29 rural hydroelectric power stations have been built, providing electricity to 859 collective farms. Thirty districts in the state have been electrified, the total number of electrified collective farms has reached 4,647, 210,000 collective farm families and thousands of cultural and other institutions have installed electric lights, and more than 4,000 threshing stations and a large number of livestock farms, flour mills, etc. are using electricity. The collective farmers of the state have also vowed to build hundreds of power stations before the end of this year, supplying electricity to 1,700 collective farms. In the northwestern Karelia-Finland Republic, 60 hydropower stations have been built since the war, and hundreds of collective farms have been supplied with electricity. In the first half of this year alone, the power stations jointly built by the collective farms exceeded the original plan by ten, and dozens of new hydropower stations are now under construction. In the Buryat-Mongol Autonomous Republic of Siberia, collective farms also have power transmission equipment. Now, in addition to several small power stations with 25 kilowatts of electricity designed to supply one collective farm, there are also several power stations with 160 kilowatts to 300 kilowatts of electricity under construction. This type of power station can supply electricity to several collective farms at the same time.
　　
Electrification has saved a lot of labor in agricultural production. Electrically powered sawmills, flour mills and pumping stations meet the needs of many collective farms. This year, a total of more than 12,000 electric threshing stations are working for collective farms, and the number of electric threshing machines has doubled compared to before the war. Now electricity has been applied to grain harvesting and grain drying.
　　
Agricultural electrification has begun to become a vital element in the lives of Soviet farmers. It not only enables them to achieve high labor efficiency, but also increases the social wealth of collective farmers and improves their living standards. Many farmers' families already have electric refrigerators, radios, electric irons and other electrical appliances.
　　
Soviet factories have given great help to agricultural electrification. They sent a large number of workers and experts to the countryside, and supplied equipment and materials. For example, the staff and workers of factories in Leningrad have helped build 445 collective farm electrification projects this year, and another 500 collective farms will also complete electrification. Such patriotic initiatives of Soviet workers have been echoed by students. Two thousand students from technical schools are participating in the construction of two hydroelectric power stations in the Kingisepp region, which will supply 40 collective farms. More than 1,000 students from Leningrad University also participated in this work.

    莫斯科州大规模兴建水力发电站
  　许多农民家庭使用各种电气工具
    【新华社北京十五日电】综合塔斯社报道：苏联农业电气化广泛发展。莫斯科州的集体农场现正实行着巨大的电气化计划，在过去六个月内已建立了二十九座乡村水力发电站，供给八百五十九个集体农场用电。该州已有三十个区电气化，电气化的集体农场总数达四千六百四十七个，二十一万个集体农民家庭和数以千计的文化机关和其他机关都已装了电灯，四千多座打谷站和大批牲畜饲养场、面粉厂等等已在利用电力工作。该州的集体农民并誓言要在本年底前建造成百余座电力站，供给一千七百个集体农场用电。在西北部的卡累利阿——芬兰共和国，战后已建设了六十个水力站，数以百计的集体农场已有了电力供应。仅仅在今年上半年集体农场所共同建设的动力站就比原来计划所规定的多了十个，现在又有几十个新水电站在建设中。在西伯利亚的布利亚蒙古自治共和国，集体农场也有了电力输送设备。现在除去为供应一个集体农场而设计的具有二十五千瓦电力的若干小发电站外，还有具有一百六十千瓦到三百千瓦电力的若干发电站正在建筑中，这种发电站可以同时供应好几个集体农场的电力。
    电气化使农业生产节省了大量劳动力。使用电力的锯木场、面粉厂和唧水站满足了许多集体农场的需要。今年共有一万两千多个电气打谷站为集体农场工作，电气打谷机的数量已倍于战前，现在电力已应用于谷物的收获和谷物干燥工作方面。
    农业电气化已开始成为苏联农民的生活要素，它不但使他们取得高度的劳动效率，同时还增加了集体农民的社会财富，提高了集体农民的生活水准，许多农民家里已有了电气冰箱、无线电、电熨斗和其他电气用具。
    苏联的工厂给农业电气化以巨大的帮助，他们派出大批工人和专家到乡村去，而且供给装备和器材。例如列宁格勒的制造厂和工厂的职工在今年已帮助建设了四百四十五个集体农场的电气化，另外还有五百个集体农场亦将完成电气化。苏联工人们这样的爱国倡议得到了学生们的响应。有两千名工艺学校的学生正参加建设钦吉塞普地区的两个水力发电站，这两个水电站将供给四十个集体农场使用。列宁格勒大学也有一千多学生参加了这一工作。
