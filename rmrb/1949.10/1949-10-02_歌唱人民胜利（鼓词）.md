　　Singing the People's Victory (Drum Song)
　　I will not speak of the Former Tang and Later Han, of peasant uprisings, or of landlords seizing the land;
　　I will not speak of Lin Chong's exile and night escape to Liangshanbo, or of Daiyu's sorrow in the Grand View Garden. Tonight the people have turned over, the era has greatly changed, the people's art must sing of the people, singing of the People's Political Consultative Conference, establishing the People's Republic of China with the people in power.

　　Let's look at history from the beginning, the suffering of the Chinese people is endless. Feudal autocracy ruled for three thousand years, the peasants shed blood, tears, and sweat; the Opium War began the great invasion of imperialism, a hundred years of double oppression continued. The Xinhai Revolution changed to the Republic of China, the warlords fought a great war, and disasters continued. On the surface it was said to be "free" citizens, but in reality, they suffered exploitation and were like slaves. The big landlords, bureaucratic bourgeoisie, and imperialism, the three major enemies colluded with each other. Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorship lasted for twenty-two years, and he wholeheartedly wanted to sell China, first to Japan, then to the United States. The Great Revolution of 1925 initially achieved victory, but Chiang Kai-shek seized the fruits of victory and rebelled: the April 12th massacre, tens of thousands of revolutionary fighters were destroyed. The August 1st Uprising, thanks to Mao Zedong's continued revolution, land revolution, the people of the Soviet area turned themselves over. The young Red Army was established, and Zhu De's fame spread throughout the world. Chiang Kai-shek's "internal pacification" policy was very insidious, selling out the Northeast to fight a civil war with all his heart: five encirclements mobilized millions of troops, he recognized a master, the traitor Zeng Guofan. The Red Army broke through to the north to resist Japan, crossed great rivers, climbed snow-capped mountains, crossed the great grasslands, the Long March traveled twenty-five thousand miles, and achieved a victorious meeting in Shaanxi and Gansu. The border area was the base area for resisting Japan, the great banner of revolution fluttered in Yan'an. The Xi'an Incident created a new situation, and the good news of the second cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to resist Japan was spread. The eight years of the War of Resistance were extraordinary, the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army's battle achievements were numerous. The Japanese soldiers and puppet troops totaled millions, and when the Eighth Route Army was mentioned, everyone was frightened in their hearts. Japan surrendered, victory arrived, and Chiang Kai-shek played new tricks again. The conspiracies and tricks of the past eight years will not be counted for the time being, the old Political Consultative Conference agreement was torn up, going back on his word. He did not care about the people's opposition, and the traitorous treaty exchanged for American imperialist weapons and gold dollars. Three million bandit troops were dispatched, American planes, American tanks, and American ships transporting troops; a large-scale invasion of the Liberated Areas, seizing Zhangjiakou, and occupying Changchun and Yan'an. He opened a false National Congress, became a false president, and dreamed his wishful thinking in the arms of American imperialism. To protect the country and save the people, Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu called for self-defense, and the soldiers and civilians in the Liberated Areas were eager to be the first. The People's Liberation Army began a great counteroffensive, killing the Chiang bandit army, abandoning their armor and helmets, the horses falling and the men tumbling. One victory, another victory, and then three victories, liberating the entire Northeast, marching straight into Shanhaiguan. The liberation of Beijing and Tianjin was followed by the great victory of the Huaihai Campaign, annihilating seven elite corps of Chiang bandit troops in one fell swoop. The eight peace conditions were rejected by Chiang Kai-shek, and the order to advance was issued, and everyone rubbed their palms and clenched their fists. White sails like forests set off on the south bank of the Yangtze River, and a million-strong army crossed the Yangtze River. The liberation of Beijing and Shanghai came quickly, the Changsha uprising, the liberation of Xi'an. Fierce pursuit and fierce attack, all roads advancing together, the two lakes were followed by the two Guangs, and the southwest direction took Sichuan; Ningxia and Xinjiang were not to be outdone, and the Chinese people must also liberate Tibet and Taiwan. The people's revolution has achieved basic victory, and the convening of the People's Political Consultative Conference is ahead of schedule. From today, 475 million people stand up, from today, the suffering people see the sky again.

　　As early as May 1, 1947, the Chinese Communist Party called for revolutionary unity, and all democratic parties responded and issued telegrams and declarations. Everyone agreed with the Chinese Communist Party, and its proposition was that the people's interests should come first. The People's Political Consultative Conference is not the same as the old Political Consultative Conference, the Kuomintang reactionaries have absolutely no right to attend. The people's affairs are discussed together by the people, and there is no longer fear of the reactionaries restraining at the meeting and overturning after the meeting. The three months of preparatory work have been carried out well, the members have suffered a lot and do not shirk difficulties. The three major drafts have set a century of plans, and each item has been discussed carefully and thoroughly. Two preparatory meetings have been held, and the official opening was on September 21st. The place of the meeting is none other than the garden where the emperor used to tour. Eight red flags fluttered in the wind at the gate, the meeting place was full of joy, magnificent and solemn. Congratulatory messages and banners hung on all sides, and the huge portraits of Sun Yat-sen and Chairman Mao were suspended in the center. More than 620 people's representatives gathered, from all over the country; party, government, army, workers, peasants, and soldiers, no one was missing, there were old and young, men and women. Revolutionary veterans with silver beards, next to them sat good young people in their twenties. Chairman Mao sat on the first representative seat, look at his gentle and amiable smiling face. All parties and factions take the Chinese Communist Party as the head, the Chinese Communist Party has struggled for revolutionary unity for twenty-eight years. How many good sons and daughters of the party have sacrificed for the country and the people, and it is only today that the reactionaries have been defeated for three years. Chairman Mao's opening speech was clear and sincere, and 475 million people should keep it in their hearts: the great victory of the Chinese people, establishing a new people's democratic dictatorship; imperialism and its running dogs must sabotage, we must be vigilant, the revolutionary work is not over; internationally, we must lean to one side, unite with the new democratic countries, first of all the socialist Soviet Union. The representatives clapped once for every few sentences they heard, and finally clapped for a long time. Everyone is willing from the bottom of their hearts to follow the Communist Party, to follow Chairman Mao, and to do a great job in building the country. The reports of Lin Boqu, Zhou Enlai, Tan Pingshan, and Dong Biwu were clear and concise, and the representatives unanimously supported them without needing to say more. Then they were divided into groups to discuss, carefully studying the various motions. The autumn is high and the air is refreshing, and the representatives have worked hard for ten days. After the tasks were completed one by one, the conference closed and issued a declaration. The People's Republic of China was established from this, writing the first page of the new Chinese history. Let imperialism and its running dogs worry, get angry, tremble, and complain, 475 million people have won a great victory, everyone is happy in their hearts. A celebration meeting was held on the People's Square in front of Tiananmen Square, singing and dancing to their hearts' content, the Yangko dance, waist drums, dances, were noisy and lively.

　　The people's happiness is true happiness, their eyes are bright, and they have a plan in their hearts: they no longer worry that Chiang bandits will sell China again, 475 million people are in power; only construction is allowed, no destruction is allowed, the Common Program will not be overturned again. They no longer worry that Chiang bandit spies will harm people again, freedom of action and peace of mind when sleeping; the people's laws are made by the people, and they are fundamentally different from Chiang bandit's dictatorial laws. They no longer worry that life is not guaranteed, everyone works, everyone has food and clothing; saving production, supporting the front line, everyone works together, and will no longer be unable to plan for the evening, and the mother is hungry and the child is cold. They no longer worry that imperialism will invade, millions of people's troops guard the border; Commander-in-Chief Zhu has guaranteed us that any enemy who dares to make trouble will be wiped out. If you ask why we have this day, please keep the Chinese Communist Party firmly in your heart. The Chinese Communist Party is the vanguard of the working class, and it is both ordinary and extraordinary: Marxism-Leninism combined with Chinese practice, Mao Zedong Thought is our model. Serving the people wholeheartedly, the historical traces of the past twenty-eight years will be passed on forever. The wise leader Mao Zedong walks in front, followed by three million party members and tens of millions of league members. Our 475 million people have no other direction, Mao Zedong's banner is the only guide. We want to declare to the world in unison: in order to consolidate the People's Republic, we will forever move forward, forward, and forward again under the banner of Mao Zedong! The people in power must do a good job, so as not to be ashamed of the title of master of the country. The people in power must work hard to produce, taking care of all aspects. Celebrating the People's Republic of China, we want to cheer in unison: Long live Chairman Mao, long live Commander-in-Chief Zhu, long live the Chinese Communist Party, long live the people's victory, may the People's Republic of China prosper for billions of years!

　　歌唱人民胜利（鼓词）
    一不说前唐和后汉，农民起义，地主占江山；
    二不说林冲发配夜奔梁山泊，黛玉悲秋在那大观园。如今晚人民翻身，时代大改变，人民的艺术要把人民来唱，唱一回人民政协开大会，成立了中华民主共和国人民掌政权。
    翻开了历史咱们从头看，中国人民的苦难说也说不完。封建专制统治了三千载，农民流血流泪又流汗；鸦片战争开始了帝国主义的大侵略，双重的压迫继续了一百年。辛亥革命改成了民国，军阀们大混战灾祸绵延。表面上说什么是“自由”的国民，实际上受尽宰割和奴隶一般。大地主、官僚资产阶级和帝国主义，三大敌人相互勾连。蒋介石独裁二十二年一心要把中国卖，先向日本，后有美利坚。一九二五年的大革命初步得了胜利，蒋介石就劫夺胜利果实造了反：四·一二的大屠杀，成千累万的革命战士被摧残。八·一起义，多亏那毛泽东继续革命，土地革命，苏区人民把身翻。年青的红军建立起，朱德的英名天下传。蒋介石“安内”政策多阴毒，出卖了东北一心打内战：五次围剿调动了军队上百万，他认了个师傅就是那汉奸曾国藩。红军突围北上去抗日，渡大河，爬雪山，穿过大草原，长征走了两万五千里，胜利会师到陕、甘。边区就是抗日的根据地，革命的大纛飘扬在延安。西安事变造成一个新局面，国共二次合作抗日的喜讯传。八年的抗战非同小可，八路军、新四军的战绩累牍又连篇。日本兵和伪军共有几百万，提起了八路军，个个心惊胆也寒。日本投降，胜利来临，蒋介石又把新的花样翻。八年来的阴谋诡计暂时不去算，撕毁了旧政协的议案，自食其言。人民的反对他不管，卖国条约换来了美帝的武器和金元。三百万匪军齐出动，美国飞机，美国坦克，还有运兵的美国船；大举进犯解放区，夺取了张家口，又占长春和延安。开了伪国大，当了伪总统，在美帝的怀抱里打着他的如意算盘。保国家，救人民，毛主席和朱总司令号召自卫，解放区的军民个个争先。解放军开始了大反攻，杀得那蒋匪军弃甲丢盔，马仰人翻。一捷，再捷，连三捷，解放了全东北，长驱直入山海关。京、津解放跟着是淮海战役大胜利，一下子消灭了蒋匪精锐七个兵团。八项和平条件被蒋介石拒绝了，进军令下人人擦掌又摩拳。白帆如林齐发长江南岸，百万雄师下了江南。京、沪解放来得个快，长沙起义，解放西安。猛追猛打，各路齐进，两湖之后是两广，西南方面取四川；宁夏和新疆不在话下，中国人民还要解放西藏和台湾。人民革命已经取得了基本的胜利，人民政治协商会议的召开在限前。从今天四万万七千五百万人民站起来了，从今天受苦的人儿拨开云雾见晴天。
    早在一九四七年五月一日中国共产党就号召了革命大团结，各民主党派纷纷响应发表了通电和宣言。人人赞同中国共产党，她的主张是人民利益要当先。人民政协跟旧政协不是一个样，国民党反动派根本没有出席权。人民的事业人民一块来商量，再不怕反动派会上制肘，会后推翻。三个月的筹备工作进行的好，委员们多受劳苦，不辞辛艰。三大草案订下了百年大计，一条条讨论得仔细又周全。两次筹备会议开过了，正式开幕在九月二十一这一天。开会的地方不是别处，就在那当年皇帝游览的花园。大门上八面红旗迎风招展，会场里喜气洋洋，堂皇富丽又庄严。贺词锦旗挂四面，孙中山、毛主席的巨像正中悬。齐集了人民代表六百二十多位，来自地北与天南；党政军、工农兵、一行不缺，有老有少，有女也有男。革命老战士飘银髯，旁边就坐着二十多岁的好青年。第一号代表席上坐的是毛主席，你看他温恭和蔼笑开颜。各党各派以中国共产党为首，中国共产党为着革命大团结奋斗了二十八年。为国为民牺牲了多少党的好儿女，三年来打垮了反动派才有这一天。毛主席的开幕词讲得明确又诚恳，四万万七千五百万人民应该牢记在心间：中国人民大胜利，建立一个人民民主专政的新政权；帝国主义和它的走狗一定要捣乱，我们得提高警惕，革命工作没有完；国际之上必须一边倒，团结新民主国家，首先是社会主义的苏联。代表们听几句来拍一次掌，最后拍掌好大半天。每一个人都由心里愿意，跟着共产党，跟着毛主席，把建国大业做一番。林伯渠、周恩来、谭平山、董必武的报告明而简，代表们一致拥护，不待烦言。跟着是分成小组去讨论，各项议案仔细来商研。秋高气爽天气好，代表们辛苦了整十天。任务一一完成后，大会闭幕发表宣言。中华人民共和国由此成立，写下了新中国历史的第一篇。让帝国主义和它的走狗在一旁着急、生气、发抖和抱怨，四万万七千五百万人民大胜利，个个心里欢。天安门前的人民广场上开个庆祝大会，尽情歌唱尽情跳，秧歌、腰鼓、舞蹈，闹的个热火朝天。
    人民的高兴是真高兴，眼睛雪亮，心里有算盘：一不愁蒋匪再把中国卖，四万万七千五百万人民掌政权；只许建设不许破坏，共同纲领不会再推翻。二不愁蒋匪特务再把人害，行动自由睡觉也心安；人民的法律人民来制定，跟那蒋匪的独裁法律根本不一般。三不愁生活没保障，人人做工，人人有吃穿；节约生产，支援前线，大家齐来干，再不会朝不谋夕，母饥儿寒。四不愁帝国主义来侵犯，几百万人民的军队守在国境边；朱总司令给我们保证下了，任何敌人敢捣乱，一定把它消灭完。要问是什么原故咱们有了这一日，请把中国共产党紧记在心间。中国共产党是工人阶级的先锋队，说他平凡又不平凡：马列主义结合了中国实践，毛泽东思想是我们的示范。全心全意为人民服务，二十八年来的史迹永世传。英明的领袖毛泽东前头走，后面跟着三百万党员和万万千千的团员。咱们四万万七千五百万人民再没有别的方向，毛泽东的旗帜是唯一的指南。我们要同声的向世界宣告：为了巩固人民共和国，我们永远的在毛泽东的旗帜下，向前，向前，再向前！人民掌权一定得好好的干，才不愧国家主人这个头衔。人民掌政一定得努力生产，四面八方照顾得周全。庆祝中华人民共和国，我们要同声欢呼：毛主席万岁，朱总司令万岁，中国共产党万岁，人民胜利万万岁，中华人民共和国国运兴隆亿万年！
