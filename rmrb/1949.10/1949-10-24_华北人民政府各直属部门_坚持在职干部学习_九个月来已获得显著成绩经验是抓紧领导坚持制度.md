　　North China People's Government Directly Subordinate Departments
  　Persist in On-the-Job Cadre Study
    Significant Achievements Have Been Made in Nine Months; Experience Shows It Is Essential to Grasp Leadership and Maintain Systems
    [By Our Newspaper] The on-the-job cadre study of the directly subordinate departments and units of the North China People's Government has achieved great results through persistent implementation from January to October of this year. It has not only improved the theoretical, political, and cultural levels of cadres at all levels, but also increased work efficiency. A total of 1,441 on-the-job cadres participated in the study, divided into three groups: A, B, and C. At the beginning of the study, the ideological situation could be roughly divided into three categories: First, some cadres, especially responsible cadres in certain departments, overemphasized the contradiction between work and study, believing that they could not maintain study time; second, cadres from the old liberated areas generally eagerly wanted to study, but lacked confidence; third, student cadres who had newly joined the work generally did not want to start with "Social Development History," and some were overly ambitious. After the Study Committee persistently implemented the decision of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on on-the-job cadre education in a planned and step-by-step manner, they have systematically studied basic theories such as "Social Development History" and "Political Economy," and supplemented their studies with "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," Xinhua News Agency's commentary on the White Paper, and editorials on protecting state property. Generally, they can initially understand the laws of social development and the essence of the people's democratic dictatorship. There were no failing grades in the tests, and 60% scored above 80. They are now studying various documents of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. During the study process, Chairman Dong Biwu, Vice Chairman Yang Xiufeng, and more than a dozen other responsible personnel gave more than ten major current affairs and policy lectures to Groups B and C on a regular basis, which were very effective. Cadres in Group C attended elementary and junior high school classes at the spare-time school, taught by professional teachers, with regular discussions and tests. Their cultural level has improved significantly. For example, the lowest class can now grasp the main points of articles, write more fluently and clearly, and greatly reduce typos and incorrect characters. In arithmetic, they have learned the four basic operations with integers. The phenomenon of insufficient confidence at the beginning of the study among some cadres has been completely overcome. The work efficiency of most cadres has improved after the study. For example, cadres in departments such as the Ministry of Finance and the Former Higher Education Commission have generally settled down to work and are more proactive than before.
    The various departments of the North China People's Government have realized from these nine months of persistent implementation of study that the decision of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China is completely correct, and have experienced that to do a good job in on-the-job cadre study, it is necessary to grasp three basic links: First, the leadership must grasp it tightly and take action personally; second, each department must have politically strong personnel responsible for managing study, checking and supervising; third, earnestly adhere to the study system and implement the study plan. In terms of study methods, it is necessary to master the principle of combining theory with practice. For example, when studying "Social Development History," attention should be paid to linking it with the historical reality of China, and a section on the issue of New Democracy society should be added; when teaching political economy, attention should be paid to linking it with the economic crisis of American imperialism and the expansion and aggression of imperialism, the New Democratic economy, and the semi-colonial and semi-feudal economy, so as to make the study more profound and thorough.

　　华北人民政府各直属部门
  　坚持在职干部学习
    九个月来已获得显著成绩经验是抓紧领导坚持制度
    【本报讯】华北人民政府各直属部门、各单位的在职干部学习，经过今年一月到十月的坚持贯彻，已取得很大成绩，既提高了各级干部的理论、政治及文化水平，也提高了工作效率。参加学习的在职干部共一千四百四十一人，分为甲、乙、丙三组。在学习开始时的思想情况，大体可分为三类：一、有些干部、特别是某些部门的负责干部，曾过分强调工作与学习的矛盾，认为不能坚持学习时间；二、老区干部，一般都迫切愿意学习，但信心不高；三、新参加工作的学生干部，一般不愿从“社会发展史”学起，有些好高鹜远。经过学委会有计划有步骤地坚持贯彻中共中央华北局关于在职干部教育的决定，已经按步就班地学习了“社会发展史”、“政治经济学”等基本理论，并辅助学习了“论人民民主专政”、新华社评白皮书及关于保卫国家财产的社论等，一般都能初步了解社会发展规律及人民民主专政的本质，测验成绩没有不及格的，且百分之六十都在八十分以上。现在进行学习人民政协的各种文献。在学习过程中，定时地由董必武主席、杨秀峰副主席等十余位负责人员给乙、丙组上了十几次时事政策大课，收效很大。丙组干部在业余学校高小班、初中班由专业教员每天上课，按时讨论、测验，文化水平都有显著的提高。例如最低的班看文章已能抓住要点，写文章亦比较通顺明白，错字别字正大量减少，算术已学会了整数四则。某些干部，学习开始时信心不足的现象，已完全克服。一般干部的工作效率在学习以后，都有提高，如财政部，前高教会等部门的干部，已都普遍安心工作，并比以前更加积极了。
    华北人民政府各部门从这九个月的坚持贯彻学习中，体会到中共中央华北局的决定是完全正确的，并体验到要搞好在职干部的学习，必须掌握住三个基本环节，即：一、领导上要抓得紧，亲自动手；二、各部门要有政治上较强的专人负责管理学习，检查督促；三、认真坚持学习制度，执行学习计划。而在学习方法上，必须掌握理论与实际结合的原则。如在学习“社会发展史”时，要注意联系中国的历史实际，并增添一节新民主主义社会问题；在讲授政治经济学时，要注意联系美帝经济危机与帝国主义的扩张侵略，新民主主义经济，半殖民地、半封建经济等，以便使学习更加深刻透澈。
