The Dalian Institute of Hygiene
    Liao Jianting
    Origin and History

　　For their own needs, the Japanese invaders established the Hygiene Experiment Station in Dalian in 1925 (the predecessor of the Institute of Hygiene). Japanese national Akira Kanai was the director, and it was divided into three departments: Bacteriology, Serum, and Vaccine, with a total of more than 40 people. In 1926, a balance room was added, totaling four laboratories. In April 1927, the Hygiene Experiment Station was renamed the "Dalian Hygiene Experiment Station." In 1933, Ando Koji became the director, and the academic institutions within the institute were gradually expanded, such as the Hygiene Department, Pathology Department, Biochemistry Department, Parasitology Department, Bacteriology Department, Vaccine Department, and Serum Department. In addition, research laboratories were added. The main work was research, manufacturing, and hygiene experiments. Until after the Pacific War, the institute was placed under the management of the Japanese Kwantung Army and implemented strict military control. All products were supplied to the Kwantung Army and the military in North China, Central China, South China, and Korea, and secondly to the Japanese immigrants in Northeast China.

    Early Days of Liberation

　　From August 9th to 22nd, four years ago, the great Soviet Red Army liberated Northeast China and Lushun-Dalian. Under the leadership of the Lushun-Dalian District Party Committee, all health agencies in the Lushun-Dalian area also became the people's. The working guidelines and tasks of the Institute of Hygiene were to complete the people's epidemic prevention work and meet the needs of the people's liberation war. Northeast China, North China, East China, and Northwest China all received products from here, such as serum and vaccines. With the assistance of the Soviet army, the Party and government in the Lushun-Dalian area administered preventive injections for plague, cholera, and typhoid to more than 70% of the population each year. In 1948, the plague prevention injections reached more than 85%, and vaccination accounted for more than 78% of the total population of the area. Therefore, infectious diseases have been rapidly reduced over the years. In 1946, 1,160 people suffered from various infectious diseases, which had been reduced to 69 people by 1948. This is the most obvious contrast compared with the health conditions of the people in Lushun-Dalian before liberation.

　　When the Japanese invaders surrendered, they sabotaged this hygiene academic institution, attempting to make it impossible to resume work forever. In order to help the Chinese people protect the safety of the institute, the Soviet army immediately sent people to take over and supervise it. Subsequently, the People's Government also sent personnel to manage it, which stopped the sabotage activities of the reactionaries. With the direct assistance of the Soviet army and the correct leadership of the Lushun-Dalian District Party Committee and the Northeast General Health Department, work was resumed in June 1946.

　　In 1947, in order to meet the needs of the people, large-scale production was carried out. First, the interior was reorganized, waterways and workshops were built, machinery was repaired, and personnel were expanded. The Soviet army allocated some horses and funds. At the same time, employee education was carried out, employee unions were organized, and Chinese and Japanese technicians were united and transformed. Under the cooperation of Chinese and Soviet leading comrades, the manufacture of more than ten kinds of products such as tetanus antitoxin serum and tetanus vaccine was restored in June, and a gas gangrene laboratory was added. The pure culture of one of the important bacteria (Welchii) in gas gangrene was isolated, and the experiment of manufacturing toxins began. In December, there were serum products of four kinds of bacteria. Due to the lack of political work cadres and technicians, some outstanding young people were selected from the workers for training (under the rule of the Japanese invaders, Chinese people were not allowed to learn technology at all and could only do hard labor). After four months of education, preliminary gains were made in technology and politics. Four study groups were established, specific work study tasks were assigned, and a correct master-apprentice relationship was established. As a result, nine people were promoted in technology, and the technical level of Chinese technicians (doctors who formally graduated from medical universities and transferred to bacteriological work) was also improved at the same time. The teaching method of learning by application improved the technology of 23 people, making them powerful assistants in various aspects in a short period of time.

    Moving Towards Enterprise Management

　　From 1948 to June 1949, after the creation of model worker campaigns, meritorious service movements, and the establishment of a regularization system, the production task exceeded the original task by 37.8%, the types of products increased to more than 40, and the quality was also improved compared with the past. Significant gains have also been made in research work, such as the production of epidemic typhus vaccine and diagnostic solution, anthrax vaccine, and serum refining and drying by the Virology Department. Technicians overcame bad thoughts and tendencies such as the view of hiring, orthodox concepts, and waste. Economically, they achieved self-sufficiency and moved towards enterprise management. In order to solve economic difficulties and raise a large number of small animals for research work, pasture and farms were added to supply feed and vegetables for large and small animals.

　　In order to cultivate specialized technical personnel for people's health care in a planned and organized manner, a health technology specialized school was opened in March of this year. Doctors and technicians from various departments served as professors, lecturers, and teaching assistants. The funds were provided by the Dalian University headquarters. In the past six months, the educational policy and teaching methods adopted "emphasis on practice and more doing," "the connection between theory and practice," "gradual specialization," and "image education," which have been very effective.

　　These gains are mainly due to the direct assistance of the Soviet army and the correct leadership of the Lushun-Dalian District Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Northeast Health Department, and more importantly, learning from the Soviet Union in actual work.

    来源和历史
    日寇为了本身的需要，一九二五年在大连建设了卫生试验所（卫生研究所前身），日人金井章次任所长，内分细菌、血清、痘苗等三科，共四十余人。一九二六年添设了天坪室共四个研究室。一九二七年四月间，将卫生实验所改为“大连卫生实验所”。一九三三年由安东洪次任所长，逐渐扩大了所内学术机构，如卫生科、病理科、生化科、寄生虫科、细菌科、疫苗科、血清科；另外增设了研究室，主要工作是研究、制造、卫生实验等。一直到太平洋战争后，该所被划归日寇关东军经营，实行严格的军事管制，一切制品是供给关东军和华北、华中、华南、朝鲜的军用，其次是供给在东北的日本移民需要。
    解放之初
    四年前的八月九日至二十二日，伟大的苏联红军解放了东北和旅大。在旅大区党委领导下，旅大地区的一切卫生机关也变成人民的了。卫生研究所的工作方针任务是在于如何完成人民的防疫事业，适应人民解放战争的需要，东北、华北、华东、西北都得到了这里的产品，如血清和疫苗等。旅大地区党政方面在苏军协助下每年施行百分之七十以上鼠疫、霍乱、及伤寒的预防注射。一九四八年的鼠疫预防注射则达到百分之八十五以上，种痘者占全区人口百分之七十八以上，因此传染病历年来迅速减少。一九四六年患各种传梁病者一千一百六十人，一九四八年就已减至六十九人。这与旅大未解放前人民健康状况相比较成为最明显的对照。
    日寇投降时，曾对这个卫生学术机关进行了破坏，企图使之永远不能恢复工作。苏军为了帮助中国人民保护该所的安全，立刻派人接管监督，随着人民政府亦派员经营，这样才制止了反动分子的破坏行为。在苏军直接帮助和旅大区党委、东北总卫生部正确领导下，于一九四六年六月开始复工。
    一九四七年，为着人民的需要而进行大规模的生产，首先整理内部，修建水道、工作室，修理机械及扩充人员，并由苏军拨来一部分马匹、经费，同时进行职工教育，组织职工会，团结改造中日技术人员，在中苏领导同志合作下，六月间恢复了破伤风治疗血清、破伤风疫苗等十余种的制造，并增设气性坏疽实验室，将气性坏疽中的重要一种菌（Ｗｅｌｃｈｉｉ菌）分离得到了纯培养，开始试验制造毒素，十二月间就有四种菌的血清产品了。由于政工干部和技术人员的缺乏，便从工人中挑选了一些优秀青年加以培养（日寇统治时期根本不准中国人学习技术，只能作苦工）。经过四个月的教育，在技术上、政治上有了初步的收获，建立了四个学习小组，具体指定工作学习任务，建立正确的师徒关系，其结果有了九人在技术上升了级，中国技师（由医科大学正式毕业的医生转职于细菌工作者）的技术水准也同时得到了提高。学以致用的教学方法，提高了二十三人的技术，使其在短期中即成了各种的有力助手。
    走向企业管理
    一九四八年到一九四九年六月以前，经过创模运动、立功运动，建立正规化制度之后，生产任务超过了原定任务百分之三十七·八，产品种类增加到四十余种，质量亦比过去提高了。研究工作亦有显著的收获，如病毒科研究而致生产之斑疹伤寒疫苗及诊断液，炭疽疫苗，血清精制干燥等。技术人员克服了雇庸观点、正统观念、浪费等不良思想和倾向，在经济上达到了自供自给，走向了企业管理。为解决经济上的困难，及大量喂养小动物以开展研究工作，又增设了牧场、农场，供给大小动物的饲料与蔬菜。
    为了有计划有组织地培养人民的卫生保健专门技术人员，于今年三月间开办了卫生技术专科学校，由各科博士技师担任教授讲师及助教，经费由大连大学校部供给。半年来教育方针与教学方法采取了“重实习多做”、“理论与实际的联系”、“逐步专科”、“形象教育”等收效颇大。
    这些收获主要是由于苏军的直接帮助和中共旅大区党委、东北卫生部的正确领导，而更重要的是在实际工作中向苏联学习。
