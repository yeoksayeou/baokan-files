Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 17th—To welcome the Soviet cultural, artistic, and scientific workers delegation, the preparatory committee of the Shanghai branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association held a grand Sino-Soviet celebration evening party at Yiyuan on the 16th. More than ten thousand people attended, including Rao Shushi, Zeng Shan, cadres from Party and government organs, workers, farmers, youth, students, women, and cultural, artistic, and scientific workers. Subarev, former Soviet diplomatic staff in Shanghai, heads of the Soviet Foreign Cultural Association and commercial representative office, and Tsibulnovsky, chairman of the Soviet Overseas Chinese Association, and more than two hundred Soviet expatriates also participated. When Simonov and the Soviet delegation entered the venue and stepped onto the rostrum, the spotlights shone brightly, and the entire audience erupted in a storm of applause. Shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao!" and "Long live Stalin!" resounded through the clouds.

After Chen Wangdao, vice chairman of the preparatory committee of the Shanghai branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, announced the opening of the meeting, Pan Hannian, another vice chairman of the preparatory committee, delivered an opening speech, expressing a warm welcome on behalf of the preparatory committee of the Shanghai branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association to the Soviet cultural, artistic, and scientific workers delegation upon their arrival in Shanghai. Then, amidst cheers, Simonov, deputy secretary-general of the Soviet Writers Association and deputy head of the delegation, delivered a speech. He said: "We Soviet people have always been the best friends of the Chinese people, have always warmly sympathized with the Chinese people's liberation struggle, and have always deeply respected the Chinese cultural workers and Chinese intellectuals who have fought for freedom together with the Chinese people in a long and arduous struggle." Simonov then pointed out: The great victory of the Chinese people has truly opened up a broader path for cultural workers of the two countries who are working hard to consolidate the friendship between the two great nations and to further enable the Chinese people to better understand Soviet culture and the Soviet people to further understand Chinese culture. He finally stated that he would translate the great works of Chinese classical and modern literature into the languages of all Soviet nationalities and widely introduce them to the Soviet people. Dubrovinina, Deputy Minister of Education of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, was also invited to speak, and she described the achievements of the Soviet cultural revolution under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin. She said: "Before the revolution, the number of students in our country was less than eight million, but now there are 34 million. We have built tens of thousands of well-equipped and spacious schools in cities and villages. The main part of the budget of each of our republics is used for education. The budget for education in the Russian Federation accounts for 70 percent of the expenditure." She also pointed out: "Therefore, we have created new intellectuals from among the real people, from among the workers and peasants." The Soviet art performance team, the Red Army Song and Dance Troupe, and our country's performing arts troupe successively performed "Red Army Dance," "Horse Herding Dance," and large waist drum performances. The dock workers and food and beverage workers hosted by the Shanghai Drama Association also performed two Chinese folk dance arts, the Dragon Lantern Dance and the Lion Dance.

　　上海中苏友协举办晚会
  　中苏万人联欢
  　苏文化代表团受热烈欢迎
    【新华社上海十七日电】中苏友好协会上海分会筹备委员会为欢迎苏联文化艺术科学工作者代表团，于十六日晚假逸园举办盛大的中苏联欢晚会。到饶漱石、曾山及党政机关干部、工人、农民、青年、学生、妇女及文化艺术、科学工作者等万余人。苏联留沪前外交工作人员素巴列夫，苏联对外文化协会和商务代表处负责人及苏侨协会会长齐布诺夫斯基和苏联侨民亦有二百余人参加。当西蒙诺夫及苏联代表团步入会场走上主席台时，水银灯齐明，全场腾起暴风雨般的掌声。“毛主席万岁！”“斯大林万岁！”的欢呼声响彻云霄。
    在中苏友好协会上海分会筹委员副主任陈望道宣布开会后，该会筹委会另一副主任潘汉年致开会词，他代表中苏友好协会上海分会筹委会对苏联文化艺术科学工作者代表团的抵沪表示热诚欢迎。接着代表团副团长苏联作家协会副总书记西蒙诺夫在欢呼声中发表演说。他说：“我们苏维埃人一直是中国人民最好的朋友，一直是热烈同情中国人民的解放斗争，一直是深深地尊敬在长期艰苦奋斗中和中国人民一起为自由而战斗的中国文化工作者和中国知识分子的。”西蒙诺夫继又指出：中国人民的伟大胜利，对于努力巩固两大民族友谊，和进一步使中国人民更好地认识苏联文化，使苏联人民进一步认识中国文化的两国文化工作者们，是真正开拓了一条更广阔的道路。他最后表示要把中国古典和现代文学的伟大作品译成苏联各民族的文字，广泛地介绍给苏联人民。俄罗斯联邦共和国人民教育部副部长杜伯洛维娜亦应邀讲话，她叙述了在列宁与斯大林领导下的苏联文化革命的成就。她说：在革命前，我国就学人数不足八百万人，现在有三千四百万人。我们在城市和乡村内建筑了成千成万设备良好，屋宇高阔的学校。我们各加盟共和国预算的主要部分是用于教育。俄罗斯联邦共和国用于教育的预算占支出的百分之七十。”他并指出：“因此我们从真正人民之间，从工人和农民之间造就了新的知识分子。”晚会由苏联艺术演出队、红军歌舞团和我国出国文工团先后表演“红军舞蹈”“牧马舞”及大腰鼓等节目。上海戏剧协会主持的码头工人和酒菜业职工们亦分别演出两个中国民间舞蹈艺术龙灯舞和狮子舞。
