Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 16th - When the Kuomintang remnant bandit gangs fled Guangzhou, they engaged in wanton and frantic destruction. Two airports and a bridge across the river in the city were destroyed, and over a hundred vehicles were burned. The fleeing bandits also engaged in large-scale looting, and the people along the Pearl River suffered greatly. However, thanks to the rapid entry of the People's Liberation Army into the city, order has been swiftly restored. As of yesterday, the People's Liberation Army has captured over a thousand members of Liu Anqi's bandit group who failed to escape. The People's Liberation Army will, in accordance with the General Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army's order on punishing war criminals, severely punish the bandits who engaged in wanton destruction.

    【新华社广州十六日电】广州国民党残余匪帮溃逃时滥施疯狂破坏。该市两处飞机场及一座渡江桥已遭破坏，百余辆汽车亦被焚毁。残匪逃跑时并大肆抢劫，珠江沿岸人民受害极重。但由于人民解放军迅速进入城内，市内秩序业已迅速恢复。截至昨天为止解放军已擒获未及逃跑的刘安琪匪部千余人。人民解放军对于滥施破坏的匪徒，定将按照人民解放军总部关于惩办战争罪犯的命令，予以严厉惩罚。
