　　Black Stone Slope Coal Mine Drama (17)
    Kang Zhuo
    Here, Tianlu still wouldn't leave. He stayed by himself for most of the night, until Da San fell asleep. He was also really sleepy, so he lit up his pipe, using the fire to wake Da San. Da San rolled over and got up, asking, "Who is it? Why aren't you asleep yet?" He said, "I'm waiting for you!" "What is it?" "Just a couple of things." "Speak! Uh, the lamp isn't lit. Why didn't you call me earlier?" "No need to light the lamp! Save a little. Just a couple of things." Da San lit the lamp, but Tianlu crouched down again in the corner, only his pipe glowing back and forth, not saying anything. Da San didn't want to press him, so he jumped off the kang, put his hands in his sleeves, and paced back and forth. After a long while, Tianlu finally said, "At the Liugou big mine, I heard people saying that you don't want to work at Xilu's big mine after the autumn! They say you're scared!" Da San said, "What, people in Liugou are saying this too?" Tianlu added, "They also say you don't believe in the Old Lord!" Da San said, "I've heard people say that too." Tianlu continued, "People also say that when you returned to the village last year, you flooded someone's small mine and they drove you away. Have you heard this too?" Da San was taken aback and quickly said, "I haven't heard that." Then, he told Tianlu the whole story. Tianlu listened without saying anything, but he didn't leave either. Da San paused and then said, "Who do you think is setting me up, Lao Er! How come people in Liugou are also saying this? How should we deal with it?" Tianlu slowly replied, "Who knows! What are you planning to do?" Da San said, "I'm planning to leave, but Xilu won't let me, and Yubao isn't agreeing to take over for me. I don't have any ideas! What do you say?" Tianlu smoked two more bowls of tobacco before standing up and sitting on the edge of the kang, saying, "What I say, I can't really say anything. I think you shouldn't leave! Why not let Yubao be the foreman, and you be a team leader or something? Keep your mouth shut, and still marry a wife to leave some descendants!" These words were not what Da San wanted to hear, but he also seemed to know why Lao Er would say these things, and he couldn't help but feel sorry for Lao Er again. He didn't say anything, and after pacing back and forth in the room for a while, he said, "Go to sleep, Lao Er! You're very tired all day, and you have to get up early tomorrow." Tianlu sat for a while longer, smoked for a while longer, and then left, saying as he left, "But listen to me, Lao San! You still have to believe in the Old Lord! We make a living in fire and water, and if we don't believe in him, who else can we rely on for our lives!" Da San felt a pang of sadness when he heard these words, and he casually said, "Okay!" and hurriedly closed the door and went to sleep. But he didn't sleep much that night.

    Sixteen: Falling Ill

    By now, Da San felt that it was very difficult for him to stay in the village, so he decided to talk to Xilu: he had to leave! Coincidentally, Xilu was not around. He had gone out to arrange business these days, and he couldn't be found. Da San didn't want to leave without an explanation, so he was so anxious that he lost weight, his face turned yellow, and a knot was tied in his heart that he couldn't untie.

    That day, he heard that an old friend of his had arrived at the Yilitai Mine in Xihe. He wanted to go find him to chat and relax, and also discuss a solution. But he went to look for him, and the man had already left. He also took a trip to Yangquan. It wasn't very interesting, so he listlessly returned.

    When he returned to the village and walked to the place where people rested under the temple platform, he suddenly heard someone in the crowd of resting people say, "Da San went to Yilitai! I'm afraid he's looking for work!" Then he heard Niubao chime in, "That's for sure! Hmph! I've seen his kind before. He's probably afraid that the ventilation won't work in the fall! Didn't he flood someone's mine last year and get driven away? Hmph..." At this time, Da San was striding towards the group of people. People couldn't help but panic. Da San glared at Niubao with round eyes and said, "Did you see them drive me away? Let me tell you! I, Zhang Yuanlu, didn't want to work there anymore! Don't make things up!" Niubao said, "Anyway, didn't you flood someone's mine?" Da San said, "But I immediately blocked it up for them!" Niubao wouldn't admit defeat and slapped his butt, saying, "Blocked it up, but didn't you still flood someone's mine?" Da San got angry and, approaching Niubao, shouted, "So what if I flooded it? I blocked it up, what else do you have to say? You little bastard!" Niubao suddenly opened his mouth and stretched out his arm, yelling, "Okay! Why are you cursing people?" As he said this, he lunged towards Da San. Luckily, Little Foreign Devil was quick and rushed up to pull Niubao back. Niubao wouldn't submit and kept struggling while cursing, "You're cursing people! Good! If you have the ability, open the mine properly! If you have the ability, open the ventilation shaft for the village mine in the fall! I @ your ancestors for eight generations! You curse! You curse! I am the bastard that my father and your grandmother @ came up with! What are you going to do? You curse! Can you bite my balls?" Little Foreign Devil couldn't hold Niubao back, so Yubao rushed forward and pushed him away. Little Foreign Devil then turned around and pulled Da San back, saying, "Don't be like him! Don't you know his temper? Hey!" Da San ignored Little Foreign Devil and only waved the old top hat in his hand, shouting, "You dead bastard! I'll throw you far away with one lift of my hand!" Niubao wanted to rush forward again, saying, "Throw me! If you don't throw me, I'm not my father's son! Pui!" Yubao quickly grabbed Niubao again, while telling Da San to step aside. Just then, Qian Daina came down from the slope and hurriedly asked, "What are you doing? Making such a racket, do you think nobody's in charge?" Niubao immediately sat down on the ground, hoarsely crying and complaining about his grievances. Qian Daina asked Da San what was going on. Da San silently walked back. Qian Daina pulled him aside and asked him what happened, and then said, "Da San! How old are you and how old is he? If you open the ventilation shaft of the big mine in the fall, won't that show your ability? You're arguing with a child, what kind of a thing is that? You're still a respectable person who has traveled to states and prefectures and seen the world!" Da San was so angry that his head was about to explode. He stomped his foot, pushed Qian Daina away, and went up the slope. Little Foreign Devil was always afraid that something would happen, so he hurriedly chased after him, shouting, "Uncle Da San! Stop! Let me talk to you!" The others in the crowd had long slipped away one by one. Yubao was left to give Qian Daina a wink. Qian Daina then loudly shouted, "Niubao, get up and apologize to your Grandpa Da San! Really! Why are you cursing people? If he really gets angry and doesn't work, will you work on this big mine in our village? Go quickly!" Niubao was staring with both eyes, about to say something, but Yubao quickly covered his mouth. Over there, Da San was walking home when he suddenly heard Qian Daina's words. An unknown fire rushed into his heart, and he turned and walked onto the small path on the northeast slope. He was determined to find Xilu to explain that he was not going to work anymore.

　　黑石坡煤窑演议（１７）
    康濯
    这里天禄却还是不走。他一个人又呆了大半宿，直到大三睡着了，他实在也困了，才吸着了一锅烟，借着烟火叫醒了大三；大三翻身爬起，问道：“谁？你怎么还没睡？”他说：“我等你嘛！”“有事么！”“有不大两句话。”“说吧！呃，灯也没点的，你怎么不早些叫我？”“甭点灯啦！省着点，不大两句话。”大三点着了灯，天禄却又往墙角一圪蹴，光来回通着他的烟锅子，不开口；大三不好催他，就跳下炕抄着两手来回走着，老半于，天禄才说：“我在柳沟大窑上，听人们说，你秋后不想干喜禄这大窑啦！说你怕啦！”大三道：“怎么，这话柳沟也有人说？”天禄又道：“还说你不信老君爷！”大三道：“这我也听人说过。”天禄又道：“人们还说你去年回村，是给人家开土窑闹出了水，人家撵走你的。这你也听说过么？”大三吃了一惊，忙道：“这可没听说过。”接着，他告给了天禄这一切情由，天禄听了没说什么，却也不走；大三停了停又道：“你看这是什么人给我安插的，老二！怎么柳沟也有人说？咱该怎么对付？”天禄慢腾腾答道：“谁可知道啊！你盘算怎么办？”大三道：“我盘算走，可喜禄不放，玉宝也不应承接替我，我正没主意哩！你说呢？”天禄又抽了两锅烟，才站起来坐到炕沿边说：“我说嘛，我也说不成话。我看，你走是甭走罗！干嘛，还是让玉宝当领事，你不定当个刨头领岔的，顾住嘴，还是要娶个家口，也留个后代香烟啊！”这话很不对大三的心眼，但他也好象知道老二为什么会说出这些，不觉又可怜他老二了。他没说什么，又在屋里来回走了一阵，才说：“睡去吧，老二！你一天挺累，明个又得早起的。”天禄又坐了一阵，抽了一阵烟才走，临走又说：“可说哩老三！这老君爷你还得信啊！咱们水火里头干营生，不信服他老人家，这条命又靠给谁呀！”大三听了这话，不免一阵心酸，只随口道：“行！”就忙忙关了屋门，倒头便睡。但这一夜他又没怎么睡觉。
    十六　闹病
    到现在，大三可是觉着自己很难再在村里呆下去了，便决心找喜禄商量：非走不行！碰巧喜禄却不在，他这些时出外张罗买卖去了，寻也寻不见；大三又不愿不交代就走，只急得自己人也瘦了，脸也黄了，心上绞着个疙瘩，怎么也解不开。
    这天，他听说有他个老伙计到了西河义立泰矿上，他想去找人家捣拉捣拉散散心，顺便也商量个办法；但他去寻了一回，那人却走了。他又顺道去阳泉转游了一遭。也没什么意思，就又没劲没劲地回来了。
    当他回到村里，走到庙台底下人们歇凉处的时候，忽地听见歇凉的人堆里有个什么人说：“大三去义立泰啦！怕是找营生去了吧！”又听见牛宝接口道：“准是呗！哼！他那把式呀，我什么没见过？他也怕秋后风筒透不成哩！去年他不也是给人家窑里刨出了水，被人家撵走的？哼……”这时大三正闯到那堆人面前，人们不觉慌乱起来，大三瞪着两只圆眼对牛宝道：“你见人家撵走了我？告你说！是我张远禄自己不愿干才走的！别胡安插人！”牛宝道：“反正，你不是给人家窑里刨出了水？”大三道：“可我立时就给人家堵住了！”牛宝不认输，手拍屁股道：“堵住了吧，不也是给人家刨出了水？”大三火了，逼近牛宝嚷道：“刨出了水又怎么着？我堵住了，你还有什么说的？个小杂种！”牛宝忽地嘴一张胳膊一伸，嚷道：“好！你凭什么骂人？”说着，就往大三跟前窜；亏得小洋鬼腿快，忙上去拉住牛宝，牛宝不服拉，还一边使劲挣着一边骂道：“你骂人呀！好呀！你有本领就给人家把窑开好呀！有本领你秋后就给咱村大窑透开风筒呀！老子＠你八辈！你骂！你骂！老子就是我爹跟你奶奶＠出来的杂种！你怎么着？你骂！你能咬了我个球？你……”小洋鬼怎么也拉不住牛宝，玉宝才赶上去硬推开了，小洋鬼又回头拉住大三说：“你别跟他一般见识嘛！你还不知道他个脾气？嗨！”大三也不理小洋鬼，只挥着手里的旧礼帽嚷道：“个死杂种！老子一抬手撂得你远远的！”牛宝又要往前冲，一边道：“你撂吧！不撂不是老子养的！呸！”玉宝又忙拉住牛宝，一边却叫大三让一让；正在这时，乾袋脑从坡上下来，忙问：“作啥哩？吵吵闹闹的，嫌没人管么？”牛宝立时往地下一坐，干着嗓子嚎哭着诉起冤来；乾袋脑问大三是怎么回事，大三不声不响地就往回走，乾袋脑拉住他把事情问清，才说：“大三！你多大他多大？你秋后把大窑风筒透开，不就显出了你的本事？你跟个孩孩咯吵的，算哪一门啊？亏你还是个跑州走府见过世面的体面人物哩！”大三气得脑袋真要炸开，就一跺脚，推开乾袋脑往坡上去了；小洋鬼总怕闹出什么事，忙一边追着他一边喊道：“大三叔！停停吧！我对给你说说嘛！”人堆里别人早一个个溜了，剩下玉宝对乾袋脑挤了挤眼，乾袋脑就大声嚷道：“牛宝，起来，给你大三爷爷赔个礼去！真是好家伙！你凭什么骂人家？人家要真个生气不干了，咱村这大窑你来干？快去！”牛宝瞪着两眼正要说什么，玉宝忙捂住了他的嘴；那边大三正往家走，猛听见乾袋脑的话，心中不觉冲出一把无名火，就扭转身往东北坡小道上走去，他决心找喜禄交代不干了。
