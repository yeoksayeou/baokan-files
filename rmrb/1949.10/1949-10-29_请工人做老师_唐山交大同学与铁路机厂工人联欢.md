Inviting Workers to be Teachers
	Tangshan Jiaotong University Students and Railway Factory Workers Hold Joint Celebration

[Report from this newspaper] In order to combine theory with practice, students from the Mechanical and Electrical Engineering Departments of Tangshan Jiaotong University held a joint celebration with workers from the Tangshan Railway Factory on the 16th of this month at the Mingcheng Hall of Jiaotong University. They enthusiastically wanted to learn technical experience from the workers honestly, shouting the slogan "Workers are our technical mentors." At the meeting, worker representatives said: "I have been a technician in Tangshan for decades, and I felt that Jiaotong University was very mysterious, and I never even crossed the threshold. Today is different. Today, not only are we welcomed by everyone, but we are also called technical mentors. This kind of thing was absolutely impossible in the past. I am very moved. I hope everyone will come to the factory often. We are determined to tell you as much of our experience as we know." The students said, "We are not only students of professors in the school, but also apprentices of workers in the factory." For the past two weeks, students from Jiaotong University have often gone to the factory for internships and have been welcomed and enthusiastically guided by the workers of the factory, learning a lot of practical experience, such as the posture of using tools and using machines. They also got along very well emotionally, fully demonstrating the great friendship of the working class.

　　请工人做老师　
    唐山交大同学与铁路机厂工人联欢
    【本报讯】唐山交大机械、电机两系同学，为了要使理论与实际结合，于本月十六日与唐山铁路机厂工人在交大明诚堂联欢。他们热情地要老老实实向工人学习技术经验，喊出“工人是我们的技术导师”的口号。会上工人代表说：“我在唐山做了几十年技工，觉得交通大学很神秘，连门也没跨过；今天不同了，今天不仅是受到诸位的欢迎，而且被称为技术导师，这种事情在从前是绝对没有的，我内心非常感动，希望诸位时常来工厂，我们决定要把我们所知道的一点经验尽量告诉给大家”。同学说：“我们不仅是学校里教授的学生，而且是工厂里工人的徒弟”。二星期来，交大同学时常去机厂实习，受到机厂工人的欢迎和热心的指导，学习了不少实际的经验，如使用工具和使用器械的姿势等。在感情上也非常融洽，充分表现了工人阶级伟大的友爱。
