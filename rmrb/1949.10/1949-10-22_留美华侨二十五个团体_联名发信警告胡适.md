Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 21st: A delayed dispatch from New York: The New York Chinese Journal published on August 25th an open letter to Hu Shih jointly issued by twenty-five Chinese cultural groups, student groups, and overseas Chinese groups in the U.S., severely warning Hu Shih for his sinful activities of betraying the people and selling out the motherland. The letter recounted Hu Shih's traitorous activities over the years, pointing out that he had cut himself off from the Chinese people. If Hu Shih does not stop all his traitorous acts, the Chinese people will surely arrest him and severely punish him. The letter stated: Recently, the Chiang regime has repeatedly used American planes to indiscriminately bomb Shanghai citizens, destroy the Yangtze River dikes, and strafe personnel repairing the breaches. At the end of its rope, it is acting perversely, and has been denounced by Chinese and foreign democrats alike. Yet you (note: referring to Hu Shih, same below), mouthing "democracy and freedom," openly support these atrocities, and are running around calling for the United States to expand its aid to Chiang, attempting to prolong the war. We, the Chinese groups in the U.S., feel heartbroken and cannot bear to tolerate your behavior of betraying our compatriots and selling out our motherland. We have unanimously decided to issue you a serious warning. Since you cut yourself off from the Chinese people and fled to the United States, instead of reflecting on your mistakes behind closed doors to atone for your sins, you have instead incited and agitated, adding to your wickedness. You have repeatedly given speeches to various American groups, slandering the various measures of the new China; presiding over so-called "national affairs symposiums," defending the corruption, darkness, and brutality of the Chiang regime, emphatically stating that the Chinese people have consistently supported Chiang; signing the "July 7th" memorial declaration, advocating "suppressing the rebellion to the end," advocating a "scorched earth policy." You have also colluded with Kong Xiangxi, Song Ziwen, Jiang Tingfu, Li Weiguo, Gu Weijun, Lai Lian, and others to instigate the organization of the so-called "League for a Free and Democratic China," openly supporting the principles of the "Open Door Policy" and "Equal Opportunity" of the "Nine-Power Treaty," making China forever subject to the enslavement and domination of the powers; and advocating increasing the number of Japanese troops re-entering the country to jointly "oppose communism," even advocating a third world war, not hesitating to trample and devastate the land and people of the motherland, just so that you have the opportunity to return to China to exploit the people and act like tyrants! ... Now we must seriously warn you: The movement of the people of the motherland to fight for democracy and freedom will achieve a comprehensive victory in a short period of time. Your traitorous actions can only increase the suffering of some compatriots and will never be able to hinder the progress of the motherland. Do not think that under the protection of the United States, you can do whatever you want and remain at large. When the situation changes and the light shines everywhere, even if you flee to the ends of the earth, you will be arrested and brought to justice.

At the same time as the publication of this open letter, Zhu Qixian, chairman of the joint conference of various groups, also made a statement. He pointed out that the resolution to publish an open letter warning Hu Shih was passed at a symposium held in July by nineteen Chinese groups in the U.S. jointly opposing Chiang Kai-shek's bombing of Shanghai. Later, six more groups were willing to participate, expressing unified action. Zhu Qixian said: In the United States, such united action by twenty-five Chinese groups is unprecedented in many years. At the same time, in this letter, one can also see the general attitude of Chinese people in the U.S. towards current national affairs.

　　留美华侨二十五个团体
  　联名发信警告胡适
    【新华社北京廿一日电】纽约迟到消息：纽约华侨日报八月二十五日刊载，二十五个留美中国文化团体、学生团体及侨胞团体联名发表致胡适的公开信，对于胡适背叛人民出卖祖国的罪恶活动，予以严重警告。信中历述胡适历年来的卖国活动，指出他已自绝于国人，胡适如果不停止其一切卖国行为，中国人民必将把他缉拿归案，予以严办。该信略称：最近蒋政权屡次使用美国飞机，滥炸上海市民，毁坏长江堤岸，扫射抢修决口人员，日暮途穷，倒行逆施，已为中外民主人士所同声申讨，而你（按：指胡适，下同）口述“民主自由”，却公然拥护暴行，奔走呼吁美国扩大援蒋，企图战祸之延长。我留美中国各团体，对于你背叛同胞出卖祖国的行为，痛心疾首，忍无可忍，经一致决议，向你提出严重警告。自从你自绝于国人，逃亡美国之后，不知闭门思过，以图自赎，反而煽惑招摇，加重罪孽。你多次向美国各种团体演讲，丑诋新中国之种种措施；主持所谓“国是座谈会”，为蒋政权的腐败黑暗残暴辩护，力言中国人民始终拥蒋，签名于“七七”纪念宣言，主张“戡乱到底”，主张“焦土政策”。你又和孔祥熙、宋子文、蒋廷黻、李惟果、顾维钧、赖琏等人同流合污，策动组织所谓“自由民主中国联盟”，公然拥护“九国公约”之“门户开放”、“机会均等”的原则，使中国永受列强的奴役宰割；并主张增派日兵重入国土，共同“反共”，甚至鼓吹第三次世界大战，不惜祖国的土地人民蹂躏涂炭，只求你们有机会再回到中国去鱼肉人民作威作福！……现在我们不能不严重警告你：祖国人民争民主争自由的运动，短期间内就要取得全面胜利，你的卖国行为，只能增加一些同胞的苦难，绝不能阻挠祖国的前进。你不要以为在美方庇护下，可以为所欲为，逍遥法外，等到情势一变，光明普照的时候，就是你逃到天涯角海，也要缉拿归案。
    在发表这封公开信同时，各团体联合会会议主席朱启贤并发表谈话。他指出，发表公开信警告胡适的决议，是七月间十九个留美中国团体联合举行的反对蒋介石轰炸上海的座谈会上通过的，后来又有六个团体愿意参加，表示一致行动。朱启贤说：在美国，二十五个中国团体如此联合一致的行动，实为多年来所不曾有，同时，在这封信里，也可以看到留美中国人士对现在国事的一般态度。
