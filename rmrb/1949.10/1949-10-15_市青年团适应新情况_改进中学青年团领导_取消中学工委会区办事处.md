　　Municipal Youth League Adapts to New Situation
    Improves Leadership of Middle School Youth League
    Abolishes District Offices of Middle School Work Committee
    [Beijing News] The Beijing Preparatory Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League decided to abolish the five district offices under the Middle School Work Committee of the Committee from the 8th of this month, and divide them into four work groups according to the nature of the schools to conduct unified leadership at the municipal level. In the early days of liberation, due to heavy tasks and little work experience among Youth League members in schools, it was necessary to establish offices by region to help the Youth League branches in schools solve these many problems. Over the past eight months since liberation, the ideological and political level of students in Beijing schools has generally improved, and the administrations of various public middle schools generally pay attention to helping the work of the League, and political instructors have been generally established, who can help the leadership of the League. Moreover, the basic task at present is how to run the school well and complete the study of the New Democracy. Under this new situation, leadership work must be strengthened, work must be studied in depth, experience must be summarized regularly, the level of ideological leadership must be improved, and the planning of work must be strengthened. Therefore, the past way of working in which decentralized cadres were busy solving daily affairs must be improved. Now, the Middle School Work Committee of the Beijing Preparatory Committee of the Youth League leads the middle school work of the city by grouping according to the different nature and different situation of the schools. In order to make the understanding of the situation and the research work more in-depth, a research group is also set up to cooperate with the research office of the Municipal Committee of the League to conduct key research on certain issues on a regular basis.

　　市青年团适应新情况
    改进中学青年团领导
    取消中学工委会区办事处
    【北京讯】中国新民主主义青年团北京市筹委会决定自本月八日起取消该会中学工作委员会所属的五个区办事处，按学校的性质分为四个工作组集中市一级统一进行领导。在解放初期，由于任务繁重，校内青年团团员工作经验很少，为具体帮助校内青年团支部来解决这许多问题，因此有必要按地区成立办事处进行工作。解放八个月来的北京各校学生，思想与政治水平已普遍提高，又各公立中学行政上一般都注意帮助团的工作，普遍设立了政治教员，可以帮助团的领导。而且摆在目前的基本任务是如何把学校办好，完成新民主主义的学习。在这一新的情况下领导工作必须加强，必须深入地研究工作和经常地总结经验，提高思想领导的水平和加强工作的计划性，因此过去的分散干部忙于解决日常事务的工作方式，必须改进。现青年团北京市筹委会中学工作委员会按学校的不同性质及不同情况分组领导全市的中学工作。为使情况了解和研究工作更深入，并设有研究组，配合团市筹委会研究室经常进行某些问题的重点研究。
