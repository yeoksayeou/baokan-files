What I Have Learned?
    Pei Wenzhong
        (I) How Did I Learn?
    From the liberation of Beijing to now, in this short half-year period, I have gained many valuable learning opportunities, which have transformed my thinking and have transformed me, a typical petty-bourgeois figure, in the process of metamorphosis.
    First of all, I want to thank several young friends who gave me many documents before the siege of Beijing, allowing me to have the opportunity to read them first. After the liberation of Beijing, they immediately and spontaneously organized study groups, and I also participated, studying together with them. We studied together for more than a month, and I gained very little myself. At that time, I was just like waking up from a big dream, my eyes still hazy, and for everything, I seemed to understand, but didn't understand!
    At the end of March, I joined the Chinese delegation to the World Congress of Supporters of Peace, passed through the Soviet Union, attended the meeting in Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia, and returned to Beijing, which was already the end of May.
    At first, when I joined this delegation, I was still confused and even a bit arrogant; but soon after, I immediately felt that the leaders were clear about the problems and accurate in grasping policies, which could not but make me admire them immensely. Even the "kids" in the delegation (as the members of the delegation called several young friends), their cultivation, attitude, style, and spirit of service, etc., were all worth learning from, and I was afraid it would take a long time to learn. Looking back now, this delegation really gave me the most in-depth education, and these two months of delegation life were the most valuable learning opportunity in my life. Before going abroad and after returning to China, I changed a lot in my thinking. After this study, I seemed to have woken up, suddenly enlightened, and understood. Understood what? Understood that I am not good at anything and should intensify my learning and learn quickly!
    After returning to Beijing, at the beginning of June, I participated in the administrative staff training class and studied for a very short period. Later, I participated in a study group for technical personnel. Now, these three months of formal study have come to a preliminary end, and we will study business for a long time in the future.
    In addition to formal study, I also participated in many "meetings." I attended every meeting, and stayed until it was over, because I wanted to learn in the "meetings." I carefully took notes of the speeches of many people at each meeting. This gradually gave me some understanding of politics.
    In addition, I made more efforts to find opportunities to attend large lectures. As long as I knew about them and could enter, I would not give up the opportunity.
    More than half a year has passed quickly since the liberation of Beijing. Now, at the end of the initial study, I should examine myself and see what I have learned?
    Frankly speaking, my learning environment is not very good, and my social relations are quite complicated. There are indeed progressive friends, but there are also many backward friends. For example, my friends have very different views on my learning. Some friends have three views: (1) They think that I study natural science and don't need to study Marxism-Leninism; (2) They think I am speculating; if my learning is automatic, they think it is an insult to me; if my learning is passive, (3) They think that my studying Marxism-Leninism is "changing careers."
    For example, some people criticize me for being enthusiastic and loyal "palanquin bearer" for attending meetings. I think these many statements are major or minor obstacles in my learning progress. I want to learn, not only must I not be prevented by obstacles, but also remove these obstacles, large and small, from my friends.
    Speaking of which, my learning method is very simple, that is, to explain the theories I am currently learning with my existing knowledge, which can also be said to be combining theory with practice, or combining learning with business.
    I originally studied geology, and later specialized in paleontology, which is the paleontology of invertebrate animals; after I started working, I was studying the paleontology of vertebrate mammals; in recent years, I have drilled into the tip of the ox horn, specializing in Quaternary geology and prehistoric archeology. After repeated changes, none of these specialized things have been mastered. However, in summary, it seems that I have some fragmentary knowledge of geology, paleontology, and prehistoric archeology. Therefore, in the past six months of learning, I have tried my best to integrate what I am currently learning with my existing knowledge of these three disciplines. In other words, if I have a sentence or half a sentence of understanding of dialectical materialism and historical materialism, I will use examples from geology, paleontology, and prehistoric archeology to think about whether this theory of materialism is understandable in these three disciplines. I often ponder a question for several days, and sometimes use a paleontology book as a reference book for materialist dialectics, comparing the two. Sometimes I write each reason on one piece of paper, and the opposing reasons on another piece of paper, and then put them together to compare them with each other, discussing and studying with myself, and finally making a judgment myself.
    After such a period of study, I feel from a rough perspective of the theories of dialectical materialism and historical materialism that geology, paleontology, and prehistoric archeology should be applied using this theory. I think that any natural scientist who is not very stubborn probably has the same feeling as me.
    Below, I will briefly write down what I have learned, as a basis for my further study, and I hope that my predecessors, teachers, and friends will give me guidance and criticism.
    　　　　(II) From Theory to Practice
    (A) Dialectical Materialism in Geology
    I will only give a simple example to illustrate dialectical materialism in geology. This example is "change," how does it change? and why does it change?
    A high mountain, a vast ocean, a long river, in the eyes of a geologist, are all "changing." This kind of change is the change mentioned in dialectical materialism, that is, quantitative change leads to qualitative change. All geological phenomena are developing under this natural law. Geology is the science that explains this natural law of development.
    For example, a long river, from youth to adulthood to old age, is a slow, step-by-step quantitative change. After the river reaches old age, it can become a lake, which is a sudden qualitative change. But we who study geology must regard the change of the river from youth to adulthood to old age and the change from the river to a lake as a continuous phenomenon, as a change. The result of the former change leads to the latter change. In this way, we will not become mechanical materialists, and we will not regard the change of the river as merely a change in position.
    For example, the mutual change of land and sea in the Paleozoic era, and the advance and retreat of glaciers in the Quaternary period, we often regard the change of land and sea or the advance and retreat of glaciers as an isolated change, and regard it as a simple cycle change, so we infer that geological phenomena are mechanically "restored." In fact, the area, depth, temperature, and the organisms contained in the sea in each period of the Paleozoic era are different; each glacial period of the Quaternary glaciers also has different regions and properties, not a simple repetition of a phenomenon, but a stage in the development process, advancing step by step, and progressing in a new direction.
    The above is about the change of geological phenomena, how does it change? Now let's talk about why it changes?
    Since the day the Earth was formed, until now, there have been "contradictions" in various parts, and only with contradictions can there be "change," and only with change can there be "development." Each stage of development has its revealed main contradictions, and therefore has its main changes, that is, there are major geological phenomena. A certain contradiction in the Earth always exists, but it can be particularly revealed in a certain stage of development, and many kinds of contradictions are not necessarily particularly revealed at the same time. Therefore, we can regard the entire history of the Earth's development as the history of contradictions in various parts of the Earth.
    From the time the Earth was formed to the time when there were organisms on Earth, the main contradiction in the Earth was the contradiction between the shrinking crust and the high-temperature Earth's interior (geocenter), so volcanic eruptions often occurred. This is the first stage of the Earth's development, which in geology is called the "Azoic Era" (or "Archaean Era").
    The second stage of the Earth's development, the main contradiction is the contradiction between various parts of the crust (such as the sialic zone and the simatic zone). The various parts repel and compress each other, so the phenomenon of multiple mutual changes of land and sea is generated, and the organisms in the sea also develop accordingly. The most prosperous higher organisms have developed to fish, which is what geology calls the "Paleozoic Era."
    After the Paleozoic era, until now, the main contradiction of the Earth is the contradiction between "high" and "low" on the surface of the crust, so high mountains are eroded and become lower, and low places on land and oceans become higher due to accumulation. (Note: In addition, there are many kinds of local "changes," such as: climate change, river and lake change, glacier change, etc.) However, the contradiction between the crust and the geocenter and the contradiction between various parts of the crust still exist, so volcanic phenomena can occasionally occur in a corner, and the crust may have phenomena of depression or part of a high mountain occurring. Also because of this, the "change" of the Earth never stops, it is always changing, always developing, and developing to the appearance of the Earth we live on now. This last stage of the Earth's development includes the "Mesozoic Era," "Cenozoic Era," and "Psychozoic Era" in geology.
    (B) Paleontology and Marxism
    When I read Chapter 4, Section 2 of the History of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of the Soviet Union (i.e., Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism), I read:
    "In contrast to metaphysics, dialectics does not regard nature as a static state, a stagnant state, but as a state of constant movement, constant change, constant innovation, and constant development, in which there is always something being produced and developed, and there is always something being corrupted and declining." (Page 135)
    At that time, I wrote the words "basic principles of paleontology" next to this paragraph. Later, I thought, aren't the basic principles of geology and prehistoric archeology also the same?
    At that time, I also wrote an example targeting something being produced and something being declining: such as the Hipparion and Equus in the Chinese Sanmen Series strata. The Hipparion of that period was something that was corrupted and declining, and the Equus was something that was being produced and developed. Now I can add another sentence: the Equus of the Sanmen Series evolved from a Hipparion of the Pontian period. After the Sanmen Series period, that is, during the Quaternary period, it evolved into another kind of horse. Although the Equus of the Sanmen Series that we discovered is a "fossil," a dead thing, we cannot but regard it as an individual in a stage of continuous change, just like a photograph in a movie. It is not static, it is not a stagnant thing.
    Later, I read: "Only what is being produced and developing is invincible." This immediately reminded me of many examples in paleontology. The most popular and most significant example is the reptiles of the late Paleozoic era. At that time, they were very small and few, but they were being produced, so in the subsequent Mesozoic era, some reptiles were still very powerful, developing into various kinds of strange and huge animals, occupying the world.
    Why did reptiles develop so much in the Mesozoic era? People who study paleontology also need an explanation. This explanation is because the reptiles of the Mesozoic era achieved special development in the "way of obtaining living materials," for example: the various parts of the body (such as legs, neck, head, mouth, teeth, etc.) were suitable for obtaining the abundant food at that time (such as other small animals, grass, leaves, etc.).
    I often compare reptiles to capitalists in capitalist society. From the perspective of historical materialists, it occurred in the previous era, the Paleozoic era (i.e., the old system); it developed to the extreme and became a huge monster, just like capitalism developed into imperialism; but it entered the geological Cenozoic era, i.e., the later stage of biological development, and it became completely extinct!
    What became extinct in the later era was not the entirety of reptiles, but only those strange and huge reptiles. As I said before, this kind of animal was "accelerated" because it obtained a suitable way of obtaining living materials at that time.
    Opposite to accelerated development is "slow" development. Even now, there are still many kinds of small reptiles in the world, because their living material conditions have not changed significantly. Although 20 or 30 million years have passed, there have been no major changes around them, and they still maintain their original reptile lifestyle.
    Because the biological world has accelerated and slow development, and the speed of acceleration and the degree of slowness are different, from the oldest and simplest organisms on Earth (such as single-celled organisms) to the present, various kinds of organisms have developed and jointly formed the current biological world.
    Michurin's biology is based on the principle of accelerating the development of organisms, so that organisms can be accelerated to develop in a direction that is more useful to humans, in order to improve the lives of all mankind.
    (C) Archeology and Marxism-Leninism
    My own use of the Marxist-Leninist worldview to specifically explain prehistoric archeological problems can be said to have started from my explanation of the spread and mixing of Chinese prehistoric cultures. I have regarded all three Chinese prehistoric cultures (microlithic, painted pottery, and black pottery cultures) as things that are constantly changing. Due to the relationship between time and geography, these changing cultures have differences in various aspects. With my method of explanation, many problems that could not be solved before can be solved. Many predecessors, teachers, and friends in the archeological circles at home and abroad have given me many inspirations or guidance in this theoretical aspect, so that I can have this way of looking at problems. I should especially thank them.
    During the period of the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, I once said: "I am sure that China will not always be like this, and there will definitely be a big change soon." I have also repeatedly said: "History will not repeat itself." My many views are based on the principles of human development given to us by the predecessors and teachers in the archeological circles, that is, archeologists look at the development of human culture, and Marxist-Leninists look at the development of human society, and there are the same laws of development.
    Archeologists want to collect all underground materials as a basis for human historical research. Therefore, archeologists see human history as the history of the people, not the history of emperors, officials, and a few people. I once said angrily: "China has no history," meaning that Chinese old historians have never written a history of the Chinese people, but only made many "chronicles" for the emperors and officials of the past dynasties.
    For example, people who study archeology attach great importance to "inventions." For example, the invention of fire, pottery, bronze, iron, steam engines, and electricity are all epoch-making events in human culture; but they do not pay much attention to the inventors, because we believe that invention is a product of the times and a result of the accumulation of human experience. For example, after human scientific knowledge and all conditions are available at that time, a not-too-stupid person, such as Watt, can invent the steam engine.
    The above are a few examples of my understanding of archeology before I studied. But at that time, I had at least two problems that I had no way to solve. The first is: why do some archeologists have different views from us? For example, the British @德穆尔, he insisted that naturally broken stone flakes are artificially made stone tools. For example, some people criticize me for saying that my statements in archeology (such as criticism of Chinese history) are "too biased." After a considerable period of study, I gradually understood that @德穆尔 is a idealistic archeologist. People who criticize my thinking as being too biased are not personal relationships, but are standing on different class positions from me to look at problems, so the opinions of the two sides will not be consistent.
    The second is: is the method of archeology to study dead people related to modern living people? After studying, I understand somewhat: the theory of social science and the theory of proletarian revolution applied by Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin and the revolutionary theory led by Mao Zedong in China, although starting from different places from archeology, have the same results, because they are both based on scientific and natural laws of development, and the methods researched. Some people think that archeology is useless, which is a major mistake!
    (D) Summarize My Learning into a "Museum"
    When I first heard the sentence "Labor created man," I felt very uncomfortable in my heart, and always thought: "From ape to man" is the result of "evolution" (I myself call it "evolution"), what does it have to do with "labor"? Friends often discussed this issue with me, and after a period of study, I gradually understood that I only saw the phenomenon of evolution, but did not pursue the essence of evolution.
    Why did "ancient ape" (I think we should add the word ancient to avoid confusion with modern apes) evolve into "man"? In the eyes of anthropologists, it is because the body is upright. We can also ask again, why did the body stand upright? The reason is very simple, that is, after the forest gradually disappeared, the ancient apes could not but change from the life of quadruped climbing on trees to the life of walking on the plain. Also because the food on the plain is not as big and plentiful as the food in the forest, the ends of the front limbs (hands) had to move more (if you don't want to call it labor) to pick the small and scarce food on the plain. Because the front limbs had another major responsibility, the responsibility of supporting the whole body was completely borne by the hind limbs. In simple mechanics, the body must be horizontal to support the whole body with four limbs, and the body must be upright to support the whole body with two legs, that is, stand upright. When the ancient apes stood upright, the result was that the brain volume could be increased, and there was intelligence; the neck part had space to develop vocal organs, and there was language. This is how "apes" evolved into humans. If we trace the origin, isn't it the result of the movement (labor) of both hands?
    From then on, I was convinced of Engels's sentence, and therefore my view of labor changed. In the past, I could only reach the point of not despising labor, but I did not value labor. After such a change in my thinking, I realized that we should have a correct and firm Marxist-Leninist proletarian stand and viewpoint, so that we will not waver in observing things.
    I understood that labor created man, and then I understood that labor created the world. I feel that these two simple sentences are of great importance to the learners' view of labor and class viewpoint. I think that if people can completely believe these two sentences (of course, not a dogmatic way of believing), they will not be half-hearted about social development and the Chinese revolution. Therefore, I first imagined and planned how to use pictures and objects to illustrate the process of "from ape to man," that is, to specifically illustrate the stage of development through which labor created man. With pictures and objects, people can easily and thoroughly understand. This involves the museum career that I am usually very interested in.
    After studying for a considerable period of time, I think back to the museums I have seen before, this is terrible! Most of the museums in our country are run by imperialists. After our study group discussed the white paper published by the US State Department, my personal understanding of imperialism became clearer. We should transform the museums of imperialism. As for the museums run by our Chinese people themselves, in addition to the "general store" type museums, it can be said that most of them are propaganda organs for feudal society, and are places for the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie to enjoy or pass the time. The general public cannot gain anything from them. We should also transform them. In addition, we know that museums are the most effective places to educate the broad masses of the people, and we should develop this cause.
    Summarizing what I have learned, I thought of linking everything I know and have learned together, into one thing, connecting it into a complete set of knowledge - this product is a "natural science museum (the name is not fixed)" that I imagined. This museum includes four parts: 1. The history of the Earth's development, using dialectical materialism to explain the phenomena, stages, and results of the Earth's development; 2. The history of biological development, using the principles of historical materialism and dialectical materialism to explain and illustrate the development process and stages of organisms; 3. The history of human development, that is, using objects and pictures to illustrate "labor created man"; 4. The relationship between man and nature, that is, explaining how humans transform nature, that is, "labor created the world." We must have a class stand, have a mass viewpoint, and combine Mao Zedong Thought, step by step to run such a museum. So that the broad masses of the people can be widely and deeply educated in new democracy and obtain a systematic and interconnected knowledge. This kind of knowledge not only comes from books, but also comes from objects and images. The broad masses of the Chinese people can fully exert their wisdom based on this knowledge and jointly transform nature and build a new China.
    If the museum I imagined can be realized, that is, the theory I understand can be further put into action, so that it will not become empty talk. In this way, I will not fail the many friends who helped me learn, and I myself can stand up in the tip of the ox horn and truly serve the people!
    I believe that now that the People's Government has been established, the People's cause can be developed. I myself want to advance together under the banner of Mao Zedong, in the large ranks of 475 million Chinese people!
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　1949, 9, 23
    Too much has been written, and I have to stop here, but many problems still exist. The most important thing is: are the above methods of explanation for geology, paleontology, and archeology far-fetched and committed to left-leaning infantile disorder? I originally wanted to write a few more sentences on this type of problem, but then I thought it was unnecessary, it is better to wait for criticism. I sincerely hope: that all those who study natural science can test materialist dialectics and see to what extent it can be applied to the theory they are familiar with? I think: if you only think that what you know and have learned is the most scientific without reviewing it, you will lose the attitude of a scientist!

### 我学习了什么？

专栏：

　　我学习了什么？
    裴文中
        （一）我怎样学习？
    从北京解放到现在，在短短的半年期中，我曾得到了很多的可宝贵的学习机会，使我底思想在转变中，使我这样一个典型的小资产阶级人物在蜕化中。
    我首先要感谢几位年青的朋友，他们在北京围城之前，曾交给了我许多文件，使我先有阅读的机会。北京解放之后，他们又立刻自动地组织起学习会，我也参加，同他们共同学习。我们共同学习了一个月多，我自己所得很少。那时的我，正好象大梦初醒，睡眼朦胧，对于一切，似明白，不明白！
    三月底我参加了世界拥护和平者大会中国代表团，经过了苏联，在捷克京城布拉格开完了会，回到北京，已经是五月底了。
    最初参加这个代表团，我还是糊里糊涂的，而且态度有些高傲；但是过了不久，我立刻就感觉出来，领导方面的诸位先生们，他们对于问题认识的清楚，对于政策把握的准确等等，不能不使我钦佩万分，就是代表中的娃娃们（代表团同人都如此称呼几位年青的朋友），他们底修养、态度、作风以及服务的精神等等，也都值得我学习，而怕非短期间所能学习到的。现在回想起来，这个代表团实在给了我一个最深入的教育，这两个月的代表团生活是我半生以来，最宝贵的学习机会。出国之前，与回国之后，我在思想上改变了许多。经过了这个学习，我好象是睡醒了，豁然开朗了，明白了。明白了什么？明白了我自己在任何一方面都不行，应当加紧学习，赶快学习！
    回到北京之后，六月初我参加了行政人员训练班，学习了一个很短的时期，后来又参加了一种技术人员的学习会。到了现在，这三个月的正式学习，已经作了初步的结束，我们以后要长期学习业务了。
    除了正式学习之外，我又参加了许多“会”。我是有会必到的，到了必要开完，我底意思是要在“会”中学习。在每一个会上，许多人底讲话，我都用心笔记下来。这个使我在政治上渐渐有些认识。
    此外，我更努力寻找去听大课的机会，只要我知道，而能够入场，我是不肯放弃机会的。
    从北京解放到现在，已经匆匆过了半年多，现当初步学习结束的时候，我自己应当检讨一下，究竟我学习了什么？
    干脆来说，我学习的环境，并不很好，我底社会关系，相当复杂，进步的朋友固然有，落后的朋友也不少。例如：对于我底学习，朋友们底看法就很不同。某些朋友底看法有三种：（一）认为我学习自然科学，用不着学习马列主义；（二）认为我是投机；如果我底学习是自动的话；认为对我是一个侮辱；如果我底学习是被动的话，（三）认为我学习马列主义是“改了行”。
    再如：有人对于我底开会，批评我是热心的，忠实的“抬轿子者”。我以为这许多说法，都是我学习进展中的或大或小的障碍。我要学习，不但自己要不为障碍所阻止，而且还要把这些大大小小的障碍从朋友面前去掉。
    说起来，我学习的方法，很简单，就是将我现在所学习的理论，用我已有的知识来解释，也可以说是理论与实际联系起来，或者说是学习与业务联系。
    我最初是学地质学的，后来又专攻古生物学，是无脊椎动物部分的古生物学；赶到作事之后，却是在研究有脊椎动物部分的哺乳动物的古生物学；近若干年来，自己又钻入了牛犄角尖，专门研究第四纪地质和史前考古学。经过了一改再改，所以这许多种专门的东西，都没有搞通。然若总结起来，似乎是对于地质学、古生物学和史前考古学也有些片段的知识。因此我在半年多的学习过程中，尽力地将我现在所学习的东西，与我已有的这三种学科的知识熔合在一起。换句话说，就是我如果对于辩证唯物论及历史唯物论，有一句或半句的了解的时候，我都要用地质学、古生物学及史前考古学的实例来想一想：这种唯物论的理论，究竟在这三种学科上讲得通讲不通。我自己常为一个问题，在思索几天，也有时用一本古生物学的书作为唯物辩证法的参考书，二者对照着看。更有时将一种理由逐条写在一张纸上，反对的理由写在另一张纸上，然后再放在一起，互相对照，自己同自己讨论研究，最后自己再下一个评判。
    经过了这样的一个学习时期，我从粗枝大叶地看辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义上的理论，觉得地质学、古生物学及史前考古学完全应该运用这个理论。我想：凡一位不很固执的自然科学家，恐怕与我均有同感。
    我在下边将我学习中所得，择要简略写出来，好作我再进一步学习的基础，并希望诸先辈师友们给我指导及批评。
    　　　　（二）从理论到实际
    （甲）地质学上的辩证唯物论
    我只举一个浅明简单的例子，说明地质学上的辩证唯物论。这个例子就是“变”，怎样变？和为什么变？
    一个高山，一片大海，一条长河，在一个地质学家看来，都在那里“变”。这种变，就是辩证唯物论上所说的变，即由量变而引起质变。一切地质现象，都是在这种自然规律下发展着。地质学就是解释这种自然发展规律的科学。
    例如一条长河，由幼年成年到老年，是慢慢地一步一步的量变，河流到了老年之后，可以变成湖泊，这就是突然的质变。但是我们学地质的人必须把河流由幼年成年到老年的变和由河流变为湖泊的变，看作一个连续的现象，看作是一个变，前者的变的结果引起后者的变。这样方不致成为机械的唯物论，而看为河流的变仅仅是一种位置的变。
    再如：古生代海陆的互变，第四纪冰川前进后退的变，我们常常把海陆的互变的变，或者冰川前进后退的变，看作一个孤立的变，而认为是简单循环的变，于是推论地质现象是机械的“还元”。其实古生代每个时期的海，所占的面积，深度，温度，以及海中所含的生物均不同；第四纪冰川的每个冰川期也有着区域和性质的不同，均不是一种现象的简单重复，而是发展过程中的一个阶段，是一步一步地向前进，是向着新的方向进展。
    以上是地质现象的变，怎样变？再说一说，为什么变？
    地球从生成之日起，一直到现在，各部分有“矛盾”存在着，有矛盾才有“变”，有变才有“发展”。每一个发展的阶段，有其揭露出来的主要矛盾，因而有其主要的变，也就是有主要的地质现象。地球中的某种矛盾，永远存在着，但是在某一个发展的阶段中可以特别揭露出来，而许多种矛盾并不一定同时并行地特别揭露出来，所以我们可以将全部的地球发展史，看作地球各部分的矛盾史。
    从地球生成之后，到地球上有了生物之时，地球中主要的矛盾是冷缩的地壳与高热的地球内部（地心）的矛盾，因而常常发生火山爆发的现象。这就是地球发展的第一个阶段，在地质学上是为“无生代”（或“太古代”）。
    地球发展的第二个阶段，主要的矛盾是地壳各部分（如矽铅区及矽镁区）的矛盾，各部分互相排斥压迫，因而生成了多次的海陆互变的现象，海中的生物亦因而发展，最繁盛的高级生物曾发展到鱼类，这就是地质学上所谓的“古生代”。
    古生代之后，一直到现在，地球的主要矛盾是地壳表面“高”与“低”的矛盾，因而高山受浸蚀作用而变低，陆地低处和海洋因堆积而变高。（注：此外尚有许多种局部的“变”，例如：气候的变，河湖的变，冰川的变等）但是地壳与地心的矛盾和地壳各部分的矛盾仍然存在着，因而火山现象也可偶而在一个角落中发生，因而地壳又有凹入或高山一部分的现象发生。又因为这样，所以地球的“变”永远没有停止，一直在变，一直在发展，而发展到现在我们居住的地球的样子。这个地球发展的最后阶段，包括地质学上的“中生代”、“新生代”及“灵生代”。
    （乙）古生物学与马克斯主义
    当我读联共（布）党史第四章二节（即辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义）之时，读到：
    “与形而上学相反，辩证法不是把自然界看作静止不动的状态，停顿不变的状态，而是看作不断运动，不断变化的状态，不断革新，不断发展的状态，其中始终都有某种东西在产生着和发展着，始终都有某种东西在败坏着和衰颓着。”（一三五页）
    当时我在这段的旁边，写了：“古生物学基本原则”几个字，后来我想，地质学和史前考古学的基本原则又何尝不是如此哩？
    我当时又针对有某种东西在产生着和有某种东西在衰颓着，写了一个实例：如中国三门系地层中的三趾马和单趾真马。那个时期的三趾马是败坏着和衰颓着的东西，单趾真马是产生着和发展着的东西。现在我还可以补充一句：三门系的单趾真马是由蓬蒂纪一种三趾马演变而来，过了三门系时期之后，即第四纪之时，又演变成另外一种马。虽然我们所发见的这种三门系的真马是“化石”，是死的东西，但是我们不能不看作它是不断的变化中一个阶段的一个个体，正好象是电影片子中的一张像片一样。它不是静止不动的，不是停顿的东西。
    后来又读到：“只有正在产生，正在发展的东西，才是不可战胜的。”使我立刻联想到古生物学上的许多例子，人们最喜欢谈和最显著的例子，是古生代末期的爬行动物。当时它们很小很少，但是正在产生，于是到了此后的中生代，一部分爬行动物还了得，发展成各式各样的，奇形怪状的，庞大无比的动物，占据了世界。
    为什么中生代的爬行动物特别发展起来？研究古生物的人也要有一个解释。这个解释，就是因为中生代的爬行动物，在“生活资料谋得方式”上，获得了特别发展，例如：身体各部分（如腿、颈、头、口、牙齿等）适合于获得当时丰富的食料（如其他小动物，草、树叶等）。
    我常把爬行动物比作资本主义社会中的资本家，由历史的唯物主义者看来，它是在前一个时代的古生代（即旧制度）中发生的；它发展到极端，而成了庞大的怪物，就好象资本主义发展成帝国主义一样；但是走入了地质上的新生代，即生物发展的后一阶段，它就完全绝灭了！
    到后一个时代中绝灭的，并不是爬行动物的全体，只是那些奇形怪状的、庞大的爬行动物。前边已经说过，这一类动物是因为获得了当时生活资料的适宜谋得方式，因而“加速”发展起来。
    与加速发展相反的，是“迟缓”发展。一直到现在，世界上还有许多种小的爬行动物，因为它们生活物质条件没有重大变化，虽然过了二三千万年，它们的身边还是没有什么重大变化，仍旧保持着它们原始爬行动物的生活方式。
    因为生物界有加速和迟缓发展，且加速的速度与迟缓的迟的程度又各有不同，所以从地球上最古最简单的生物（如单细胞生物），发展到现在，而形成了各式各样的生物，共同构成了现在的生物界。
    米邱林底生物学，便是应用生物加速发展的原则，使生物向人类更有用的方面加速发展，为全人类谋生活上的改善。
    （丙）考古学与马列主义
    我自己用马列主义的世界观，来具体地解释史前考古的问题，可以说是由我解释中国史前文化的传布及混合开始的。我曾将中国史前三种文化（细石器、彩陶和黑陶文化），全看作了时时在变化的东西，因为时间和地理的关系，这种变动的文化，就有了种种方面的不同。用我这种解释方法，才能解决了许多从前不能解决的问题。中外考古界的诸前辈师友，在这方面的理论上，曾经给与我许多启示或指引，我才能有这种看问题的方法，我应当特别感谢他们。
    在国民党反动派统治的时期，我曾说过：“我确信，中国不会永远这样下去，不久一定有一个大的转变”。我也曾一再重复地讲：“历史是不会重演的。”我这许多看法，也都是根据诸位考古界的前辈师友所给与我们的人类发展的原则，这也就是说，考古学家看人类文化的发展，与马列主义者看人类社会发展，是有着同样的发展规律的。
    考古学家是要搜集一切地下材料，来作人类历史研究的根据，因此，考古学家看人类底历史，是人民大众底历史，而不是帝王公卿少数人的历史。我在从前曾很气愤地说：“中国没有历史”，意思是说，中国旧的历史学家，始终没有写出一部中国人民底历史来，而只是替历代帝王公卿作了许多“年表”。
    再如学考古的人看“发明”，都看得很重，例如：火、陶器、铜器、铁器、蒸汽机、及电气等的发明，都是人类文化上划时代的事件；但对于发明人则并不十分重视，因为我们认为发明是时代的产物，是人类经验的累积的结果。例如：当时人类科学知识及一切条件具备之后，有一位不太笨的人，如瓦特者，即可发明蒸汽机。
    以上是我在未学习之前，对于考古学的认识的少数例子。但是那时我至少有两个问题是没有方法解决的。第一是：为什么还有一部分考古学家与我们底看法不同？例如：英国＠德穆尔，他硬说天然破碎的石片是人工制作的石器。再如：还有人批评我，在考古学上的说法（例如对中国历史的批评），是我底思想“太偏”。经过了相当时期的学习，我渐渐明白了，原来＠德穆尔是唯心论的考古学家。批评我思想太偏的人，不是个人的关系，而是与我站在不同的阶级立场上看问题，所以两方面的意见，不会一致的。
    第二是：考古学研究死人的方法，是否与现代活人有关系？经过了学习之后，我有些明白了：社会科学的理论及马恩列斯所应用的无产阶级革命的理论和毛泽东在中国领导的革命理论，虽然与考古学由不同的地方出发，但所得的结果相同，因为同是根据科学的、自然发展规律，而研究出来的方法。有人以为考古学没有用，是一个重大的错误！
    （丁）将我底学习总结成一个“博物馆”
    当我最初听见“劳动创造了人”这句话的时候，心里很觉得不舒服，总以为：“从猿到人”，是“进化”（我自己则叫作“演变”）的结果，与“劳动”何干？有朋友常同我讨论这个问题，我又经过了一个时期的学习，我渐渐明白了，明白了我只看到演变的现象，没有追求演变的本质。
    为什么“古猿”（我以为我们应当加一古字，以免与现代的猿相混）演变成“人”？在人类学家看来，是因为身体直立的原故。我们还可以再追问，为什么身体直立起来？理由很简单，就是当森林渐渐消灭之后，古猿不能不由树上四足攀援的生活，改为在平地上行走的生活。又因为平地上的食物，不如森林中的食物大而多了，于是前边两肢的末端（手），不能不多多动作（假如不愿意叫作劳动的话），好摘取平地上小而少的食物。因为前肢有了另一种重大责任，所以把支持全身的责任，完全由后肢担任起来。在浅近的力学上讲，四肢支持全身，身体要横着，若用两条腿支持全身，则身体必要竖起来，也就是直立起来。古猿将身体直立起来，其结果则可将脑量增大，而有了智力；项颈部分有空间可以发达发音的器官，而有了语言。这样就使“猿”演变成人。我们若追本溯源，还不是两只手要动作（劳动）的结果么？
    从此而后，我确信了恩格斯这句话，因而对劳动的观点变了。从前我只能作到不轻视劳动的程度，但并没有把劳动看重了。我经过了这样一个思想上的转变，于是才知道，我们应当有正确的、坚定的马列主义的无产阶级的立场和观点，方不致在观察事物上，摇摆不定。
    我搞通了劳动创造人，接连又搞劳动创造了世界。我觉得这两句简单的话，却对于学习者底劳动观点及阶级观点上有重大关系。我以为人们若能彻底相信这两句话（当然不是教条一样的信法）之后，方能对于社会发展，及中国革命等不致半信半疑。因此，我首先在想象着，筹划着如何用图画及实物来说明，“从猿到人”的过程，也就是来具体说明劳动创造了人所经过的发展阶段。有图画，有实物可以使人们容易而透澈地了解。这个就牵连到我平常很感兴趣的博物馆事业了。
    我学习相当时期之后，我再回想我从前所见到的博物馆，这可不得了！我国的博物馆多半是帝国主义者所经营的，从我们底学习会讨论了美国国务院发表的白皮书之后，我个人对于帝国主义的认识更清楚了些，帝国主义的博物馆，我们应当改造。至于我们中国人自己所办的博物馆，除了“杂货铺”式的博物馆外，可以说，多是替封建社会宣传的机关，是资产阶级及小资产阶级享受或消遣的地方，一般人民大众是不能从中有所得的，我们也应当改造它。此外，我们更知道，博物馆是教育广大的人民最有效的地方，我们更应当使这种事业发展起来。
    总结我所学习的东西，于是我想到把我所知所学统统联系在一起，成一个东西，联贯为一整套的知识——这一个产品就是我想象的一个“自然科学博物馆（名称不拘）。这个博物馆，包括四部分：１、地球发展史，用辩证唯物主义来说明地球发展的现象、阶段、及结果；２、生物发展史，用历史唯物论及辩证唯物论的原则，解释并说明生物的发展过程及阶段；３、人类发展史，即用实物及图画说明“劳动创造了人”；４、人类与自然的关系，即说明人类如何改造自然，也就是“劳动创造了世界”。我们要有阶级立场，要有群众观点，更要结合毛泽东思想，一步一步地办理这样一个博物馆。使人民大众，可以广泛地深入地受到新民主主义的教育，得到一个有系统的、互相关联的知识。这种知识，不但是从书本中来，而且是从实物及形象中来。中国广大的人民以这种知识为根据，方可充分地发挥他们底智慧，共同改造自然，建设新中国。
    如果我所想象的博物馆能够实现，那就是我所了解的理论，更进一步而能行动起来，不致成了空谈。这样，方不辜负许多帮助我学习的朋友们，而我自己也可在牛犄角尖中站起来，能够真正为人民服务！
    我相信：现在人民底政府已成立，人民底事业就可发展起来。我自己要在毛泽东底旗帜之下，在中国四万万七千五百万人民底大行列中共同前进！
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　一九四九，九，二十三
    写得太多了，不能不就此停止，但是问题仍然存在着很多。最重要的是：以上我对于地质学、古生物学及考古学的解释方法，是否牵强附会，犯了左倾幼稚病？我原想再就这类问题，再写几句，后来一想不必了，不如等待批评。我热烈诚恳地希望：凡学自然科学的人们可以考验唯物辩证法一下，看它在哪一种程度之下，可以应用到自己所熟习的理论上去？我以为：如果只认为自己所知所学是最科学而不加以检讨，则失掉科学家底态度了！
