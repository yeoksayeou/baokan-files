Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 6th: According to a dispatch from Electrone Telegraph Agency on the 5th: The Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) and the Communist Party of Germany (KPD, West Germany) have both put forward proposals calling for the establishment of a democratic and unified all-German government. The Political Bureau of the SED has issued a declaration regarding the Soviet note to the United States, Britain, and France. The declaration traces the various efforts made by the Soviet Union to resolve the German question in the spirit of the Potsdam Agreement, stating: "The Soviet Union has proven to be the only defender of a unified and independent Germany, and the only friend of millions of working people who desire peaceful lives." The SED calls on the German people to organize a democratic all-German front to defeat the policies of Western imperialism. At a meeting of the SED Presidium on the 4th, Chairman Pieck of the SED suggested consulting with all democratic parties and organizations on the issue of establishing an all-German government. Pieck stated: The German people will never accept the Bonn separatist "government's" policy of dividing Germany. Chairman Lehmann of the KPD (West Germany) also issued a statement declaring: In its note to the Western occupying powers, the Soviet government made it clear that it will never recognize the division of Germany, nor will it recognize the establishment of the West German puppet government or the Western countries' policies aimed at prolonging the occupation period and making the signing of a peace treaty impossible. On behalf of the KPD, Lehmann demanded the establishment of an all-German government that can convince the whole world of the German people's desire for peace, and called on all freedom-loving Germans in the Western occupation zones to support such a government.
