　　Northeast and North China Support the Jiangnan Region
　　Over 810,000 Tons of Materials Transported to Shanghai and Nanjing via Railway
　　Ministry of Railways Stipulates Halved Freight Rates for Specialty Products Exported from Flood-stricken Areas

　　[This Newspaper's Report] Since Shanghai's liberation and the subsequent blockage of maritime traffic, the people of Northeast and North China have been actively supporting Great Shanghai. Utilizing railway transportation via Pukou to Shanghai and Nanjing, as of September 18th, a total of 811,357 tons of materials have been transported. Among them, coal accounts for 746,361 tons, grain 27,736 tons (equivalent to about four months' food supply for all 4.5 million citizens of Shanghai), timber 12,270 tons, and other goods totaling 24,040 tons. This is of great significance to supporting Shanghai's industrial production and the anti-blockade struggle. To fulfill the increasingly heavy monthly transport tasks, the Military Commission's Ministry of Railways is actively carrying out major repairs on both southern and northern railways, demanding the universal elimination of slow speeds and increased line capacity. It is expected that the transport of goods between the North and South will be greatly improved by mid-November.

　　[This Newspaper's Report] Previously, in order to take care of the export of specialty fruits from flood-stricken areas, the Military Commission's Ministry of Railways stipulated that pears, dates, and persimmons transported from stations between Jinghai and Dexian on the Jinpu Railway could be charged at 50% of the current fourth-class freight rate until the end of November. Recently, due to the large number of people in Henan, Shandong, Hebei, and Jiangnan who rely on fruits for their livelihood, the Military Commission's Ministry of Railways has specifically re-stipulated that, starting from October 15th, all railways transporting pears, dates, and persimmons (including the Jiangnan Bureau) will be handled according to the price reduction method, with no restrictions on date or region.
　　According to statistics from the Cangxian Prefecture Commissioner's Office, this year the area produced 47,744,290 jin of pears and 16,413,110 jin of dates, totaling 64,157,400 jin. If all are sold, it can be exchanged for 60 million jin of coarse grains, which, mixed with wild vegetables, can solve the half-year living needs of 600,000 people.

　　东北、华北支援江南
    经铁路运沪宁物资已超过八十一万吨
    铁道部规定水灾地区输出特产运价减半
    【本报讯】自上海解放，海上交通被阻隔后，东北、华北人民为积极支援大上海，利用铁路交通经由浦口运往上海南京各地的物资，截至九月十八日为止，已有八十一万一千三百五十七吨。其中煤占七十四万六千三百六十一吨，粮食二万七千七百三十六吨（约合全上海四百五十万市民四个月的食粮），木材一万二千二百七十吨，其他货物共二万四千零四十吨。对于支援大上海工业生产及反封锁斗争关系甚为重大。军委铁道部为了完成逐月加重的运输任务，现正积极进行南方、北方铁路大补修，要求普遍消灭徐行，增加线路容量，预计十一月中南北物资交流运输工作将大大提高一步。　　　　　　　　　（人民铁道报社）
    【本报讯】军委铁道部前为照顾水灾地区特产水果输出，曾规定在津浦线静海、德县间各站承运之梨、枣、柿子，可按现行四级运价率减收百分之五十至十一月底为止。近因河南、山东、河北以及江南各地依靠水果为生者，为数甚多，军委铁道部特重新规定：自十月十五日起，各地铁路承运梨、枣、柿子（江南局包括在内），一律按减价办法办理没有日期和地区限制。
    据沧县专署统计，今年该区产梨四七、七四四、二九○斤，枣一六、四一三、一一○斤，共六千四百一十五万七千四百斤。如全部售出可换回粗粮六千万斤，掺杂野菜，可解决六十万人的半年生活。
