In Changsha, firecrackers exploded as if celebrating the New Year.
    The people of Changsha warmly welcomed this good news that marked a new era in the history of Sino-Soviet relations. When the propaganda team of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Changsha and the yangko team organized by department store employees spread the news to the citizens, the surrounding audience responded with thunderous applause and cheers of "Long live Stalin" and "Long live Chairman Mao." The shops along the road simultaneously set off firecrackers, as if it were the New Year.

　　长沙市爆竹齐鸣有如过年
    长沙人民热忱欢迎这个把中苏关系史上划了一个新时期的佳音。当驻长人民解放军某部的宣传队和百货业职工等组织的秧歌队向市民传播这个消息时，四周观众报以雷鸣的掌声和“斯大林万岁”、“毛主席万岁”的欢呼声。路旁的商店同时燃起了爆竹，有如过年。
