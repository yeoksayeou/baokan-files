Beijing News: In order to meet the actual needs of various regions and to introduce unemployed intellectuals and workers in Beijing to jobs, and to solve the employment problems of the poor and refugees in Beijing, the Beijing Municipal People's Government has reached agreements with relevant agencies in Northeast China, Hebei, Chahar, Suiyuan, and Pingyuan provinces. Starting from October 9th, the district public offices (or district governments) in Beijing will handle the registration and referral of the following personnel:

(A) Intellectual Registration:

(1) 500 primary school teachers for Hebei Province. Age: 20 to 45 years old. Qualifications: Graduated from a later-stage normal school or senior high school. Work area: Rural areas in southern and western Hebei, those who do not want to go to very remote areas will not be sent.

(2) 100 primary school teachers for Chahar. Qualifications: Junior normal school or junior high school graduation. Work area: Mostly in Yanbei, a few in Chabei.

(3) 40 primary school teachers for Suiyuan Province, 100 for Pingyuan Province.

(4) The Northeast mining area needs 300 young students who have graduated from high school to go to the Northeast for six months of training and then work as accounting statisticians.

(B) Unemployed Worker Registration:

The North Manchurian mining area needs thousands of foundry, coal mining, and logging workers with technical skills or labor.

(C) Immigrant Registration:

The Chabei and Subei regions are sparsely populated with vast land areas that need to be reclaimed. This winter, there are plans to immigrate 3,000 people to Chabei and 200 people to Subei. Anyone who is experiencing financial difficulties and is willing to go to agricultural reclamation to settle down (each household must have at least one male laborer) is welcome. Transportation and meal expenses will be provided, and cotton clothes, quilts, and cotton shoes will be issued as appropriate. The government will provide production start-up capital (including agricultural tools, seeds, livestock, and one leather jacket per household) and loans for the first year of reclamation, which will be repaid in installments over several years without interest.

The above has been agreed upon by the Beijing Municipal People's Government and the relevant provinces and regions. Registration has begun in the district public offices. Those who are interested in going to work should register as soon as possible and not miss the opportunity. (Municipal Government Press Office)
