　　Working in the Countryside Has Tempered Us
　　Gu Wenhao
　　Our group of five went to Sandun, Hangzhou County, to work in the countryside.

　　When we first arrived, the farmers would run away when they saw us. Saying "Please sit down" was considered good. When we spoke to them, we didn't understand nine out of ten sentences. We felt that to overcome this difficulty, we had to start by learning to labor. So we worked with them to tread waterwheels and pull weeds. At first, after treading the waterwheel a few times, our whole body felt weak. After pulling weeds for a few rows, our backs ached and our legs hurt, and we were covered in sweat. We endured it with all our might. When they saw this, they treated us very warmly, greeting us with smiles and shouts of "Comrade, Comrade!" and "Old Gu! Old Zheng!" They stuffed handfuls of beans into our bags and invited us to eat cakes. This enthusiasm greatly encouraged us.

　　After working for half a month, Old Zheng said, "Now I can't stand people wearing colorful clothes." We ate two meals a day, and the food wasn't very good, but we never complained. After coming back from work during the day, we helped with cooking, buying vegetables, and making noodles. At first, we thought it wasn't necessary to do these things, but later we overcame this lazy thought.

　　We took turns standing guard at night. Originally, one hour was enough for each person, but we stood for two hours. Under the moonlight, the full moon moved from east to west, and our shadows moved from west to east. We would ask, "Isn't it almost time to finish?" and the reply would be, "Stand for a little longer!" We often went out into the moonlight to write diaries, writing until the first guard's shift ended and the second guard took over.

　　We were very busy with work, but we still tried to find time to study, staying up late to discuss the Youth League constitution, etc.

　　Our work required us to create our own experience, but this difficulty was also overcome. Old Cen did the best job, thoroughly investigating the ideology and living conditions of all the farmers in the three Jia he was responsible for. Every classmate could recite the names of all the members of the farmers' association in their Jia and knew the situation of each member. This time, when we were transferred to Sibaobao, Old Cen opened up the situation in just three days, and the masses immediately united with us.

　　At the end of August, some students wanted to return to school to study, but the county party committee called on us to continue working, so we launched an ideological struggle. One debate was useless, so we debated all the time. Everyone reviewed the gains of mass work, talked about the farmers' brotherly love for us, and when we talked about Comrade Hu Genrong's heroic sacrifice for the farmer masses, everyone was deeply moved. When we talked about how more than a hundred bandits and special agents were influenced by our work in the countryside and surrendered to us because our work was so thorough that they had nowhere to escape, everyone felt very excited. We unanimously agreed that leaving our rural work posts at this time would be shameful. For the sake of the broad masses of farmers, eighteen of us wrote a guarantee: we decided to continue working in the countryside.

### 下乡工作锻炼了我们

　　下乡工作锻炼了我们
    顾文浩
    我们一组五个人，下乡到杭县三墩工作。
    刚去的时候，农民见到我们就跑了，说一声“请坐”还算好的；和他们讲话，十句有九句不懂。我们觉得要打破这个困难，就先得学习劳动。于是和他们一起车水拔草，起初车水车了几脚，就全身发软，拔草拔了几行，就腰酸脚痛，满头大汗，我们拼命的忍耐下去。他们见了就待我们很热情，见面也有说有笑，“同志，同志！”“老顾！老郑！”的喊，把一把把豆塞在我们袋里，并请我们吃糕，这种热情，大大的鼓励了我们。
    工作半个月后，老郑说：“现在我对衣服穿得花花绿绿的人看不惯了，”我们一天吃两顿，吃得也不好，但我们从不发怨言。白天工作回来，就帮助烧火，买菜，打面条子，起初认为不必再做这些工作了，后来就打破了这懒念头。
    夜里轮流站岗，本来每人站一个钟头就够了，我们站上两个钟头，在月夜，圆月从东边到西边，影子从西边到东边，问：“站得差不多了吧！”答：“再站一回儿！”我们时常到月光下记日记，记到第一岗下岗，接上站第二岗。
    工作很忙，我们还要争取学习时间，开夜车讨论青年团团章等等。
    我们的工作是需要自己去创造经验的，但这困难也克服了，老岑的工作做得最好，将自己所负责的三个甲的全部农民思想和生活情况调查得一清二楚；每位同学都能背得出所负责的全甲的全部农会会员名单，并知道每个会员的情况。这次我们调到四保来，老岑只三天功夫，就打开了场面，群众马上就和我们结合在一起了。
    八月底，有些同学要想回校读书，但是县委号召我们继续工作，我们就展开了思想斗争。一次辩论不中用，就时时刻刻辩论，大家检讨群众工作的收获，谈到农民对我们象亲兄弟般的爱，和胡根荣同学的为农民群众而壮烈牺牲时，大家都深深地感动了，谈到一百多个匪特受了我们在农村中工作的影响，因为我们工作做得严密而没处逃遁，就投降了我们时，大家都觉得很兴奋。一致认为在现在这个时候离开农村工作岗位是可耻的，为了广大农民的利益，我们一起十八个同学写下了保证书：决定继续留在农村工作。
