　　Ode to Tiananmen

　　Under the banner of the five stars, we return,
　　Singing the March of the Volunteers loud and clear.
　　The new country's name is settled: "People's Republic of China."
　　Great waves of Yangge rise,
　　Red faces, white-haired elders, and yellow-haired children alike.
　　"The leader of the Chinese people,
　　Is none other than Mao Zedong!"
　　The ideology overthrows the empire,
　　The Soviet Union is our most important friend.
　　This year is "1949,"
　　China adopts the Gregorian calendar.
　　The Liao, Jin, Yuan, Ming, and Qing emperors,
　　Made this place their imperial capital for a thousand years.
　　Today it is the people's capital.
　　Our rivers and mountains are returned to us,
　　It is the people's own government,
　　It is the people's own army.
　　The painted flags and lights are one color,
　　Outside Tiananmen is a "Red Square."
　　The "Red Square" has three hundred thousand people,
　　The red flag symbolizes a red heart.
　　A red heart to defend the motherland,
　　A red heart to cherish the people.
　　"Citizens" changed to "People,"
　　The meaning in between is profound.
　　The "People" stand up,
　　To be dignified "People."
　　Those who sacrificed for the revolution,
　　Are the "People's Heroes."
　　The heroes "shall live forever,"
　　Erect a monument at the gate of China.
　　Fifty-four artillery salutes,
　　The number perfectly matches the "CPPCC,"
　　Shaking up the spirit of the Chinese nation,
　　Democracy, peace, and unification.
