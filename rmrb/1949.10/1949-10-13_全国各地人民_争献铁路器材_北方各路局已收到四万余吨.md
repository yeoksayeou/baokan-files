Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 12th. The Ministry of Railways' call to "Donate Transportation Equipment and Protect the People's Railways" has been enthusiastically responded to by Party, government, military, and civilians across the country. According to incomplete statistics, the northern railway bureaus have received 40,406 tons of donated steel rails, good rails, curved rails, scrap rails, fishplates, and spikes from various regions in one month. Among these, the Tianjin and Taiyuan bureaus alone collected over 10,000 tons. People in various areas along the Beijing-Hankou Railway in southwestern Hebei Province are even more actively donating to ensure the early repair of the Beijing-Hankou Railway. They have donated all the railway equipment they obtained during the eight-year War of Resistance against Japan and the early stages of the Liberation War when they participated in sabotaging the railway. In Handan Prefecture alone, more than 3,000 rails and over 400 pieces of parts such as splints were donated in twenty days. The people along the Fuyang River have donated many rails and are trying to salvage more than 2,000 rails still sunk in the Fuyang River and the coal mines in Cixian County.

    北方各路局已收到四万余吨
    【新华社北京十二日电】铁道部“献纳交通器材，保护人民铁路”的号召，已获得全国各地党政军民的热烈响应。据不完全的统计：北方各铁路局在一个月中已收到各地献纳的钢轨、良轨、弯轨、废轨、鱼尾板、道钉等达四万零四百零六吨。其中仅天津、太原两局搜集的就有一万多吨。河北省西南部京汉铁路两侧各地人民，他们为使京汉铁路早日修复，献纳行动更积极。他们把八年抗日战争中和解放战争初期参加破击铁路所获得的任何铁路器材都献出来了。仅邯郸专区二十天内就献出铁轨三千多根，夹板等零件四百多件。滏阳河畔的人民，交献了许多铁轨，并正设法打捞还沉在滏阳河内和磁县煤井内的两千多根铁轨。
