Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 2nd:

　　The following is the full text of Lin Boqu's opening speech at the inaugural meeting of the China Conference for the Defense of World Peace:

　　Today, on the second day of the founding of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, we gather representatives from all political parties, people's organizations, ethnic groups, and overseas Chinese in the capital of the people, Beijing, to hold this Conference for the Defense of World Peace. This is a major event of historical significance. It demonstrates to the world that our newly born People's Republic of China, our 475 million people, are resolutely in support of world peace and resolutely opposed to wars of aggression.

　　Participating in today's conference are not only representatives from all sectors of the Chinese people but also the delegation of cultural, artistic, and scientific workers from our great friendly nation, the Soviet Union, Mr. Spano, the representative of the Italian people, and the delegation of the Korean people. This indicates that today's conference is closely integrated with the international peace and democracy movement.

　　Distinguished representatives, since the end of World War II, the world has been divided into two opposing blocs: one is the peace and democracy bloc led by the socialist country, the Soviet Union, and the other is the aggressive war bloc led by American imperialism. The former bloc defends peace and democracy, while the latter provokes war, undermines peace, and opposes democracy. It is very clear that China, like all the new democratic countries, belongs to the former bloc, that is, to the peace and democracy bloc led by the Soviet Union. Everyone should remember that Chairman Mao, in his famous historical document "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," told us that we must "unite in common struggle with those nations of the world which treat us as equals and with the peoples of all countries; that is, unite with the Soviet Union, with the New Democracies and with the proletariat and the broad masses of the people in all other countries, and form an international united front." Our holding of this conference today is in support of Chairman Mao's great instruction and is an enthusiastic response to the resolution of the World Peace Congress.

　　In April of this year, representatives of peace-loving people from all over the world held the World Peace Congress simultaneously in Paris and Prague, and the Chinese people also sent a delegation headed by Guo Moruo to participate. This congress was a ruthless blow to the war-mongering bloc headed by American imperialism. The congress called on peace-loving people all over the world to realize the resolutions of the congress with action. This call of the congress was immediately responded to by the people of all countries in the world (including the people of the United States). After the congress, the people of all countries held peace congresses and demonstrations. The world's peace and democracy movement is developing with surging momentum. This force has clearly far exceeded the strength of the imperialist aggression bloc. The great victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War and the birth of the People's Republic of China will undoubtedly bring about a major change in the balance of power between the two camps in the world, which is completely favorable to people's democracy and lasting peace. Our great new force of 475 million people has joined the world peace and democracy camp and strengthened it.

　　However, imperialism will not lie down on its own. The more they fail, the more sinister and vicious their reactionary conspiracies become. American imperialism is stepping up its arms expansion, expanding its network of military bases, supporting the remnants of German and Japanese fascism, conspiring to manufacture a peace treaty with Japan that violates the Potsdam Agreement, or indefinitely delaying the peace treaty with Japan, establishing the "North Atlantic Treaty" to manufacture war, and conspiring to establish a "Pacific Alliance" that also manufactures war, in order to achieve their evil goal of attacking the Soviet Union, attacking New China, and all the new democratic countries. Precisely because of this, the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress recently issued a warning: peace is in danger! It calls on the people of all countries around the world to take practical actions today to defend world peace and to organize the movement for the International Day of Struggle for Peace. We believe that this call is completely correct. Our conference today is in response to this great call, to further organize the strength of our Chinese people to strive for democracy and peace, and to express to the people of the world: We resolutely oppose wars of aggression! We resolutely support world peace!

　　We Chinese people have experienced a long period of war and deeply know the cruelty of war, so we are firm opponents of war and firm supporters of peace. However, the Chinese people are by no means simple pacifists. If the warmongers and imperialists are determined to risk forcing us to fight, then the Chinese people, relying on the strength that has grown and developed from military struggle over the past twenty-two years, and the valuable experience gained from such a long struggle, will not hesitate to deal with them. The Chinese people firmly believe that they have full confidence in winning the final victory in the anti-imperialist struggle.

　　The Chinese people firmly believe that the most powerful response to the instigators of war is the unity and consolidation of the forces of peace. The unity of the will and actions of the people of the world fighting for peace is the basic means of thwarting the poisonous schemes of the instigators of war. Therefore, in China, we must establish a permanent body for the China Conference for the Defense of World Peace to unify and lead the work of striving for democracy and peace throughout the country. Today, the power of supporting world peace, which is the convergence of the will and actions of hundreds of millions of people, is rapidly growing. We believe that this power can certainly prevent the danger of a new war. The democratic and peaceful forces of the people of the world will surely win victory.

　　Oppose the new war conspiracy of imperialism!

　　Long live the People's Republic of China, the fortress of Eastern Peace!

　　Long live the Soviet Union, the leader of world peace!

　　Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people!

　　Long live Marshal Stalin, the great leader and teacher of progressive humanity throughout the world!

　　Long live lasting world peace!

### 中国保卫世界和平大会上  林伯渠开幕词

　　中国保卫世界和平大会上
   　林伯渠开幕词
    【新华社北京二日电】林伯渠在中国保卫世界和平大会成立大会上的开幕词全文如下：
    今天，我们在中华人民共和国中央人民政府成立的第二天，集合中国各党派、各人民团体、各民族，以及海外华侨的代表，济济一堂在人民的首都北京来举行这个保卫世界和平大会，这是一件有重大历史意义的大事。它向全世界表明了：我们这个新诞生的中华人民共和国，我们四万万七千五百万人民，是坚决拥护世界和平，坚决反对侵略战争的。
    参加我们今天这个大会的，不但有中国人民各方面的代表，还有我们伟大的友邦苏联文化艺术科学工作者代表团，意大利人民的代表斯巴诺先生，和朝鲜人民代表团。这指明了今天我们的这个大会，已经和国际和平民主的运动密切地汇合起来了。
    各位代表先生，自从第二次世界大战结束以后，世界就分成了两个对立的集团：一个是以社会主义国家苏联为首的和平民主集团，另一个是以美国帝国主义为首的侵略战争集团。前一个集团是保卫和平、保卫民主的，后一个集团是挑拨战争、破坏和平、反对民主的。十分明白，我们中国和一切新民主国家一样，是属于前一集团的，即是属于以苏联为首的和平民主集团的。大家应该记得，毛主席在他有名的“论人民民主专政”这一历史文献中，告诉我们必须“联合世界上以平等待我之民族及各国人民共同奋斗，就是联合苏联，联合各新民主国家及其他各国的无产阶级及广大人民，结成国际统一战线。”我们今天举行这个大会，就是在拥护毛主席的这一伟大的指示之下，对于世界拥护和平大会决议的热诚的响应。
    今年四月，世界各国爱好和平的人民的代表，曾经在巴黎和布拉格同时举行了拥护世界和平大会，中国人民也派了以郭沫若为首的代表团去参加。这个大会，对于以美国帝国主义为首的战争贩子集团是一个无情的打击。大会曾经号召全世界爱好和平的人民，用行动来实现大会的决议。大会的这个号召，即刻得到世界各国人民的响应。在大会以后，世界各国的人民（包括美国的人民在内）都纷纷举行拥护和平大会和示威游行。全世界和平民主的运动正以汹涌澎湃之势，向前发展。这个力量显然已经远远超过帝国主义侵略集团的力量。中国人民解放战争的伟大胜利，和中华人民共和国的诞生，无疑地将使全世界两个阵营的力量可以发生完全有利于人民民主与持久和平的重大改变。我们四万万七千五百万人民伟大的生力军，已经投入世界和平民主阵营而使之增强了。
    但是，帝国主义是不会自己躺倒的，他们愈是失败，他们的反动阴谋便愈是阴险毒辣。美帝国主义正在加紧扩张军备，扩张军事基地网，扶植德日法西斯残余势力，阴谋制造违反波茨坦协定的对日和约，或者无限期拖延对日和约，成立制造战争的“北大西洋公约”，并阴谋成立同样制造战争的“太平洋联盟”，来达到它们进攻苏联，进攻新中国和一切新民主国家的罪恶的目的。正因为这样，世界拥护和平大会常设委员会最近发出警告：和平是在危险中！它号召全世界各国人民在今天要用实际行动来保卫世界和平，组织国际和平斗争日的运动。我们认为这一号召是完全正确的。我们今天这个大会是响应这一伟大号召，进一步组织我们中国人民的争取民主和平的力量，并向全世界人民表示：我们坚决反对侵略战争！我们坚决拥护世界和平！
    我们中国人民经历过长期的战争，深知战争的残酷，所以我们是战争的坚决反对者，也是和平的坚决的拥护者。但是，中国人民决不是单纯的和平主义者。如果战争贩子和帝国主义决心冒险强迫我们作战，那么，中国人民凭着二十二年来从军事斗争中成长壮大起来的力量，以及从这样长期斗争中所得到的宝贵经验，也将不惜与他们相周旋。中国人民深信有充分把握，可以在反帝斗争中赢得最后的胜利。
    中国人民深信，对战争挑拨者最有力的回答，是和平力量的团结与巩固。全世界为和平而斗争的人民的意志和行动的统一，是挫败战争挑拨者的毒计的基本手段，因此，在中国我们要成立保卫世界和平大会的常设机构，来统一领导全国争取民主和平的工作。今天，亿万人民的意志和行动汇合起来的拥护世界和平的力量，正在迅速地壮大起来。我们相信这个力量一定可以制止新的战争的危险。全世界人民的民主和平势力是一定能够赢得胜利的。
    反对帝国主义的新战争阴谋！
    东方和平的堡垒中华人民共和国万岁！
    世界和平的领导者苏联万岁！
    中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席万岁！
    全世界进步人类的伟大领袖与导师斯大林大元帅万岁！
    世界持久和平万岁！
