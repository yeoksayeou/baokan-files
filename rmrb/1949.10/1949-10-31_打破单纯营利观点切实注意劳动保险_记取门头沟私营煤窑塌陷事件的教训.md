Break the Simple Profit-Seeking View and Conscientiously Pay Attention to Labor Insurance
    -- Remembering the Lessons of the Mine Collapse in Mentougou Private Coal Pits
    Ji Gang, Yin Tong
    The coal pit owners of the private coal pits in Mentougou, western Beijing, only care about simple profit-seeking, neglect safety equipment in the pits, and the Beijing Western Mining Bureau and the Beijing Coal Mine Workers' Union have not paid enough attention to labor insurance inspections. As a result, this serious and unreasonable phenomenon still exists in the Mentougou private mining area, which has 126 coal pits and more than 8,000 workers. It urgently needs to be corrected immediately to ensure the safety of workers' lives.
    The Min Sheng and Da Maosheng accidents were entirely caused by pit owners and foremen disregarding the safety of workers' lives and violating the government's decrees of "no eating back coal and no removing coal pillars." The Minsheng pit was originally connected to the three neighboring pits, Ruihua, Siming, Tianrui. Those three pits were flooded this summer, and the workers had no work to do. In August, the street labor union, in order to solve the workers' livelihood problems, helped the four pits reach an agreement to borrow a remaining coal pillar within the Minsheng pit for the Siming and other pits to mine. However, none of the four pits reported this agreement to the Mining Bureau. Later, Minsheng pit went back on its word and deliberately caused the pit roof to collapse to prevent the neighboring pits from advancing, resulting in a tragedy on September 17 when the main roof collapsed, killing 12 workers and seriously and lightly injuring 13 workers. After the incident, the Mentougou District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the District Government, the Beijing Western Mining Bureau, the Coal Mine Workers' Union, and other relevant units, in addition to carefully handling the aftermath and compensation work, immediately formed a district-wide worker safety committee, established safety teams in each pit to inspect the pit projects at any time, and convened a meeting of pit owners, strictly warning them to pay attention to worker safety in the future. However, shortly after, Da Maosheng again had a major roof collapse due to "eating back coal," killing five workers and injuring four. The pit foreman, Li Rong and Duan Huaizeng, not only prevented the establishment of a safety team, but when the workers who were mining coal heard abnormal sounds from the pit roof and raised concerns about imminent danger, they replied, "Accept your fate!" The next day (October 19), the lives of five worker brothers were buried in the dark pit bottom. When the bad news spread, the 8,000 worker brothers in the private pits were filled with indignation and sent representatives to file a complaint with the court, demanding that the pit owners and foremen be severely punished. The government has now taken into custody the owner of Minsheng Pit, Yang Zhipu, the foremen Li Ziru and Li Zifeng, and the foremen of Da Maosheng Pit, Li Rong and Duan Huaizeng, for legal sanctions.
    The phenomenon of pit owners simply seeking profit, neglecting labor insurance, private pits crossing boundaries to rob coal pillars, mining back coal, deliberately causing pit roofs to collapse, cutting off neighboring pits, and regarding workers' lives as worthless, is widespread. The pit owners believe: "After a worker is killed, buying a coffin and giving some millet is enough." The most basic lighting and sanitation facilities in each pit are not available. As for underground projects, such as roadways, supports, coal pillars, and ventilation, all are extremely sloppy. The roadways are extremely narrow, the supports are not of sufficient size, and the supports are not strong, or even damaged and not repaired. Therefore, deaths and injuries are unavoidable.
    After these two painful lessons, the Beijing Western Mining Bureau reviewed its work and admitted that it had neglected the safety equipment of general small pits in its inspection, and the cadre allocation responsible for the inspection was not sound (the bureau only had four technicians, and only two of them were experts in coal mining), so that the workers' safety issue was not raised to an important part of the work and given attention. The Coal Mine Workers' Union has also not done enough in educating private pit workers and leading workers to learn business, and has not implemented the idea that safety is as important as production. The Coal Mine Workers' Union has also not checked the work of the lower-level trade unions in a timely manner. For example, the agreement between Minsheng, Ruihua and other pits to mine the remaining coal pillars mediated by the street trade union was not reported to the Coal Mine Workers' Union, nor was it contacted with the Mining Bureau. The Coal Mine Workers' Union does not check the work of lower levels at any time, and there is also a lack of a strict reporting system. At the same time, the Mining Bureau and the Coal Mine Workers' Union did not cooperate closely. For example, the Coal Mine Workers' Union was not aware of the Mining Bureau's decree of "no eating back coal and no removing coal pillars." Individual workers have poor labor discipline, and the Mining Bureau is neither able to handle it alone nor cooperate with the trade union to solve it. In addition, the Coal Industry Federation has not fulfilled its responsibility to collect and report the situation of each pit. Under these circumstances, the masses of workers do not receive sufficient safety protection.
    In order to ensure the safety of workers in the future, the Beijing Western Mining Bureau, after forming the District-Wide Worker Safety Committee, has repeatedly convened foreman meetings, formulated engineering rules for small pits, stipulating that each pit shall not arbitrarily connect with neighboring pits, otherwise it must be approved by the Mining Bureau after inspection. Foremen of each pit shall not concurrently serve as foremen of other pits, and shall inspect and guide the project in the pit on time every day. If there is any danger, they shall stop work immediately and shall not delay. In addition, appropriate regulations have been made for the width and height of roadways, wooden pillars, and coal pillars, as well as ventilation equipment; and the penalty rules point out that if casualties are caused by unstable engineering, mining coal pillars, not draining accumulated water, or blasting explosions, the pit owners and foremen will be sent to the court for punishment. The Mining Bureau will generally inspect the engineering of each pit in the coming days, and will register the foremen starting from November 1, and those who pass the inspection will be given a registration certificate. Those who are merely making up the numbers will be cleared; those who are not technically proficient will be trained to improve their skills, and it is planned to organize the foremen, divide them into groups, and select group leaders to regularly gather to discuss and exchange experiences. The measures taken by the Mining Bureau are very necessary, because it is important to specifically grasp the safety situation of each pit and to organize the foremen. As for the safety team, it has played a certain role after its establishment. Each group reports to the Safety Committee when the project is dangerous and requests inspection to avoid dangerous incidents. For example, Ruihua, Fufeng and other pits have been ordered to suspend work after inspection. Jinsheng Yiji is undergoing engineering repairs, and Gongqing Ji has been allowed to resume work after inspection and repairs. However, due to insufficient publicity and explanation, some safety teams have not yet played an active role. The Worker Safety Committee should seize this link and earnestly lead. In the future, the Mining Bureau and the Coal Mine Workers' Union should cooperate effectively to educate the pit owners and foremen, and work with the workers to pay attention to safety work. The pit owners should bear overall responsibility and can no longer only focus on profits. The foremen should transform their old ideas and sincerely teach their experience to the workers. The old workers should also teach their experience to the new workers, so that the safety of private pit workers can be improved.

　　打破单纯营利观点切实注意劳动保险            
    ——记取门头沟私营煤窑塌陷事件的教训
    纪刚　荫桐
    京西门头沟各私营煤窑窑主只顾单纯营利，忽视窑下安全设备，而京西矿务处和北京市煤矿工会对劳动保险也注意检查的不够，以致拥有一百二十六个煤窑，八千余工人的门头沟私营矿区，目前还存在着这种严重不合理的现象，亟须立即纠正，以保障职工生命安全。
    民生、大茂盛两次失事事件，完全是由于窑主和作头漠视工人生命安全，违反政府“不准吃回煤、不准撤煤柱”的法令所造成的。民生窑与邻窑瑞华、四鸣、天瑞等三窑原系相通，该三窑今夏被水淹毁，工人无工可做。八月间，街工会为解决工人生活，帮助四窑协议，在民生界内借一残余煤柱，供四鸣等窑挖取，而四窑均未将此协议报告矿务处。其后，民生窑反悔，故意使窑顶塌陷，以阻止邻窑前进，以致九月十七日大顶下落，发生砸死工人十二名，轻、重伤工人十三名的惨剧。事件发生后，中共门头沟区委会、区政府、京西矿务处、煤矿工会等有关单位除慎重处理了善后抚恤工作外，并立即组成全矿区职工安全委员会，在各窑设立安全小组，随时检查窑下工程，并曾召集各窑窑主会议，严格告诫今后切实注意工人安全。但不久，大茂盛又因“吃回煤”发生大脊塌落砸死工人五名，伤四名的惨案。该窑作头李荣、段怀增不但阻止成立安全小组，并当工人采煤已听到窑顶发出异声，频临险境提出意见时，竟答以：“你们认命罢！”第二天（十月十九日）五个工人兄弟的生命即被葬送在漆黑的窑底。噩耗传出，私窑八千个工人兄弟群情愤慨，推派代表具状向法院控诉，要求严惩窑主与作头。现政府已将民生窑窑主杨志圃，作头李子如、李子凤，大茂盛窑作头李荣、段怀增看押，依法制裁。
    象这种窑主单纯营利、忽视劳动保险，各私窑之间越界抢挖煤柱，挖取回煤，故意使窑顶塌陷，截断邻窑，视工人生命如草芥的现象，是普遍存在的，窑主认为：“工人砸死以后，买口棺材，给点小米就算完了。”各窑中最起码的灯光和卫生设备，也都不具备，至于井下工程，如窑道、支柱、煤柱、通风等，皆极草率，窑道极为窄小，支柱不够尺寸，支顶不坚固，甚至残坏不堪，不加修理。所以，死伤工人事件，难免发生。
    经过这两件惨痛的教训后，京西矿务处检讨了工作，承认对一般小窑安全设备疏于检查，负责检查的干部配备也不健全（该处仅有四个技师，且其中只两人为采煤内行），以致于未把工人安全问题提到工作重要部分加以重视。而煤矿工会对私窑工人教育工作和领导工人学习业务也做得不够，未贯彻安全与生产同等重要的思想；煤矿工会对下级工会也不及时检查工作，如街工会所调解的民生、瑞华等窑挖取残余煤柱的协议，未向煤矿工会报告也未与矿务处联系，煤矿工会不随时检查下级工作，更缺少严格的汇报制度。同时，矿务处与煤矿工会配合得也不密切，如矿务处所发布的“不准吃回煤、不准撤煤柱”法令，工会毫不知晓。个别工人劳动纪律不好，矿务处既难单独处理，也不与工会配合解决。此外，窑业联合会也未尽到责任搜集和汇报各窑情况。在这些情形下，工人群众得不到足够的安全照顾。
    京西矿务处为确保今后工人安全，在组成了全矿区职工安全委员会之后，又数次召集作头会议，拟定了小窑工程规则，规定各窑不得随意与邻窑打通，否则需经矿务处查勘核准；各窑作头不得兼任他窑作头，并需每日按时下窑检查指导工程，稍有危险，即需停止工作，不得拖延。此外对窑道、木柱、煤柱的宽窄、高低以及通风设备也都有适当的规定；并在罚则中指出：如因工程不坚，采掘煤柱，不排积水，放炮爆炸伤及人命者，窑主作头送法院惩处。矿务处将于日内普遍检查各窑工程，并定十一月一日起举办作头登记，审查合格者，给予登记证。对滥竽充数的，则予以清除；对技术不高的加以训练，提高技术，并拟将作头组织起来，按组划分，选出组长，经常集会讨论，交换经验。矿务处采取这些措施是很必要的，因为具体掌握各窑安全情况，组织作头是重要关键。至于安全小组成立后，已起了一定的作用，工程有危险的各组纷纷到安全委员会报告，要求检查，以避免危险事件的发生，如：瑞华、福丰等窑，经检查后已令其停工，金生义记则正在修整工程，公庆记经检查修整后，已准复工。但，由于宣传解释不够，有一些安全小组还未发挥出积极作用，职工安全委员会应抓紧这一环节，认真领导。矿务处与煤矿工会今后要切实配合教育窑主、作头，与工人协力重视安全工作，窑主要负全面责任，不能再只顾营利。作头应改造旧思想，诚心诚意把经验教给工人，老工人也应把经验教给新工人，这样，才能使私窑工人安全获得改进。
