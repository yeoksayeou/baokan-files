　　Celebrating New China's Development of New Sports
  　Capital City Sports Meet Opens
    Representatives from Various Regions and Soviet Friends Attend
    Mayor Nie Calls for the Development of People's Sports
  　[Beijing News] The Capital City People's Sports Meet solemnly opened yesterday (the 22nd) at 9:00 AM at the Temple of Agriculture Sports Field.  Participating in the meet were over 30,000 people, including workers, soldiers, students, and cadres from Beijing.  Also attending as observers were sports delegations from the Northwest, Northeast, North China, East China, and Central China regions, as well as the cities of Shanghai, Tianjin, Nanjing, Jinan, Qingdao, Taiyuan, and Xi'an.  Over ten Soviet municipal experts, including Abramov, were also invited to attend.  A total of 16,786 people participated in the meet's performances and competitions.  The opening ceremony began amidst a sea of red flags and powerful music.  First, a well-ordered procession of 8,000 athletes representing workers, soldiers, and students, led by the five-star national flag and a giant portrait of Chairman Mao, circled the field to be reviewed by the presidium of the meet. A solemn flag-raising ceremony was then held.  The meet approved a presidium of twelve members, including Nie Rongzhen, Peng Zhen, Qian Junrui, Ma John, Xu Yingchao, Gao Tang, Liu @, Xiao Ming, Xu Liqun, Zhang Xiaomei, Xue Chengye, and Gu Qizong. Mayor Nie Rongzhen, chairman of the meet, then delivered the opening address.  Mayor Nie Rongzhen explained that this meet has two major significances: first, to celebrate the founding of the People's Republic of China, and second, to launch a call for new sports movements for the masses.  Mayor Nie Rongzhen pointed out: We must have a correct sports direction and new sports content, and we should recognize that sports are a science that studies and develops the human body's labor capacity.  It must serve the purpose of developing production and consolidating national defense.  Finally, Mayor Nie Rongzhen called on sports workers to further unite under the banner of Mao Zedong and strive for the development of the people's sports cause in New China (the full text of the speech will be published separately).  Feng Wenbin, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, pointed out in his speech: In the past, the Kuomintang reactionaries hindered the development of the people's sports cause. Today, we must develop the sports cause into a national people's movement.  He hopes that all regions and cities across the country will hold similar sports meets to develop the people's sports cause into the countryside, into factories, and among the working people across the country.  Following a report by Hou Junyan, Deputy Director of the Beijing Municipal Education Bureau and Secretary-General of the Meet, on the precautions for the conduct of the event, various performances and competitions began.

    Thirty-Six Events Held; Yesterday's Finals Results Announced
    The first day's performances and competitions, from 10:30 AM to 5:30 PM, involved a total of thirty-six events. Participants came from twenty-two units, including universities, middle schools, primary schools, workers, the Public Security Corps, and a certain regiment of the Capital Garrison.
