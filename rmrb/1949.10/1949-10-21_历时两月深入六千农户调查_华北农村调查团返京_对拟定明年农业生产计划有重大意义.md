　　After Two Months of In-Depth Investigation of Six Thousand Farming Households
　　North China Rural Survey Team Returns to Beijing
    Significant for Drafting Next Year's Agricultural Production Plan
    [Report from this newspaper] The North China Rural Survey Team, organized by the Agricultural Department of the North China People's Government and with the participation of the North China Cooperative Committee, the Cooperative Bank, and the agricultural colleges of Peking and Tsinghua Universities, set out in mid-August of this year. After more than two months, it successfully completed its mission and returned to Beijing in mid-October. The survey team was divided into seven groups: three groups for Hebei Province, and one group each for the four provinces of Chahar, Suiyuan, Shanxi, and Pingyuan, totaling more than 150 members. If we include the cadres drawn from the provinces, special districts, and counties to assist in the work, the total number of people mobilized was more than 500. The survey team included various technical personnel, and the survey content covered a wide range of issues, from farmers' production, income and expenditure, labor and animal power usage, livestock, and sideline occupations to water conservancy, land reclamation, and afforestation. The seven groups surveyed 80 counties and more than 200 villages, totaling more than 6,000 households. This scale of survey work is the first of its kind in North China and is of great significance for restoring and developing agricultural production and formulating next year's agricultural production plan. In order to effectively organize the survey materials in a timely manner, the Agricultural Department specially convened a meeting of all staff participating in the survey yesterday to study the methods of organization, report on the survey results, and hoped that each group would put forward opinions on improving agricultural production based on what they had seen and heard.

　　历时两月深入六千农户调查
  　华北农村调查团返京
    对拟定明年农业生产计划有重大意义
    【本报讯】由华北人民政府农业部主持，华北合作委员会、合作银行及北京、清华两大学农学院参加组成的华北农村调查团，于今年八月中旬陆续出发，历时两月余，胜利完成任务，已于十月中旬全部返京。调查团共分为七个小组，计有河北省三个组，察哈尔、绥远、山西、平原四省各一小组，共团员一百五十余人，若将各省、专、县抽调配合工作的干部计算在内，则一共动员了五百余人。调查团包罗了各种技术人材，调查内容自农家生产、收支、劳畜力使用、家畜、副业直至水利、开荒、造林等问题，都包括在内。七个小组共调查了八十县，二百余村，共六千余户。这样规模的调查工作，在华北说来还是第一次，对今后恢复与发展农业生产，拟定明年度的农业生产计划，均有十分重大的意义。为了很好地将调查所得材料及时整理出来，农业部特于昨日召集参加调查的全体工作人员会议，研究整理方法，汇报调查结果，并希望各小组根据所见所闻，提出有关改进农业生产的意见。
