　　Hong Kong Chinese Workers Gather in Thousands
  　To Celebrate the Birth of New China
  　Five-Star Red Flag Flies in Hong Kong
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 4th] Hong Kong News: The national flag of the People's Republic of China—the five-star red flag—is already flying in Hong Kong. The national flag printed by the Wah Sheung Daily has been distributed with the newspaper, and several trade union organizations have hung this solemn and beautiful flag. Over two thousand seven hundred Chinese workers in Hong Kong held a grand rally at the Jinling Restaurant on the 2nd to celebrate the birth of the People's Republic of China. The workers themselves organized a picket line to maintain order at the venue. In the center of the venue hung a portrait of Chairman Mao, flanked by two five-star red flags, and a huge banner reading "Celebrating the Success of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the Establishment of the People's Republic of China." Speakers at the celebration rally unanimously called on the Chinese workers in Hong Kong to unite and support the people's New China—the People's Republic of China. The celebration rally lasted five and a half hours. The British authorities in Hong Kong adopted a hostile attitude towards the gathering of Chinese workers, dispatching a large number of police officers, led by British police officers, stationed around the venue.

    【新华社北京四日电】香港消息：中华人民共和国的国旗——五星红旗已在香港飘扬。华商报印制的国旗已随报散发，若干工会机关均悬挂了这一庄严美丽的旗帜。香港二千七百余中国工人二日在金陵饭店举行了庆祝中华人民共和国诞生的盛大集会。工人们自己组织了纠察队，维持会场秩序。会场正中悬挂着毛主席像，两旁为两面五星国旗，并悬有“庆祝中国人民政治协商会议的成功和中华人民共和国的成立”巨幅横额。庆祝大会上的发言者一致号召香港的中国工人们应该团结起来，支持人民的新中国——中华人民共和国。庆祝大会历时五句半钟。香港英国当局对中国工人们的集会采取敌视态度，出动了大批警察，由英国警官率领，布置在会场四周。
