"Literature and the Nation"
    ——Reading Notes
    Ying Gang
    Using a method of contrasting the fate of writers in capitalist countries, Simonov introduced to us at the Literary Congress the life and views of Soviet writers, their position among the people, and the role they play in Soviet society. I read his speech and felt that it also pointed out the correct path for our literature.
    Bourgeois writers often regard "loneliness" as "individuality" or "independence," as if the only things mankind pursues are the coldness and ruthlessness of society, and there is nothing else of value. Soviet writers are extremely unaccustomed to this kind of lonely life, and the people do not allow them to remain silent; this feeling of being needed by the people is the main factor determining the happiness or suffering of Soviet artists. Thus, on the one hand, there is the lonely characteristic of bourgeois writers, and on the other hand, there is the enthusiasm of Soviet writers for social causes.
    Because the "people" are the masters of everything in a socialist country, they have also become the masters of "literature." The people have every reason to demand literature that suits their own tastes, so the "subordination" of writers' creations arises, because only by experiencing the feeling of being needed by the people can one be most happy. Unconditionally obeying the demands of the people can open up a vast field for literature, so "literature" in the Soviet Union has a series of important tasks: protecting the interests of the people, educating the people, looking forward to their future, ruthlessly criticizing all obstacles on the road to communist society, and filling in all the blank spots on the map of the human mind.
    Bourgeois writers despise Soviet writers with the eyes of "lack of independence," but forget their own vulgar literature's fatal disease of always being aimed at money. The reason why Soviet literature differs from the most popular third-rate works in capitalist society and occupies a fundamentally different, solemn and important position is obviously due to the great "subordination."
    The national character and mass character (popularity, social nature) of literature, and the fact that it is disseminated among the people, are the standards of the new aesthetics. Only works created using this standard enjoy the objective possibility of gaining a wide readership. It is also a weapon for criticizing a work of art. "Only those works that are both welcomed and enjoyed by the broad masses and at the same time interest the most educated and cultured representatives of the intellectual world are examples of the highest artistic skill."
    Writers are often travelers, and Soviet literature is the first fruit of traversing uncultivated land: "New social principles, new scales for evaluating people, a new understanding of social obligations and private obligations, a new morality, a new attitude towards money, life's welfare, respect for people, and the purpose of life." Filling in the blank spots on the map is almost the common task of Soviet writers: "No matter how many problems you have not solved, you, the Soviet writer, must first solve the primary problem. Choose a hero to write about: how does this person show that he is precisely the personality of all people in the new society, what has he done for this society? Why is he respected in this society?" Precisely because of this, "the vast majority of Soviet writers believe that literature is not an individualistic undertaking only related to one's own narrow personal literary preferences, but a collectivist undertaking related to the tasks proposed by the entire people to the entire literature."
    Bourgeois writers criticize Soviet writers for "lacking interest in aesthetic issues and formal issues," which just shows their own narrow understanding of literature: thinking that making literary works into forms that are difficult for people to understand is worthy of praise. On the contrary, Soviet writers believe that "profound, simple, and clear" is the highest artistic form, only in this way can a certain writer's work become the work of the entire people. Simonov said:
    We are not lonely people, our hearts are with the people, and therefore we feel ourselves to be a member of the entire people.
    "We are proud of this subordination, because it is the highest expression of freedom. And no matter when, no matter what the cost, we will not exchange it."
    This is how Soviet writers have closely combined literature and art with the interests of the country, and emitted the brand new, great brilliance of Soviet literature.
    It also pointed out the correct path for our literature.
                                                            1949, October, Zhangjiakou

　　“文艺与国家”
    ——读书笔记
    应＠岗
    用一种与资本主义国家的作家命运相对照的方法，西蒙诺夫在文联大会上把苏联作家的生活、观点，在人民中的地位及在苏维埃社会中所起的作用介绍给了我们。我读到了他的演词，觉得它同样指出了我们文艺的正确道路。
    资产阶级的作家每每将“孤独”当作“个性”或“独立性”，他们以为人类所追求的除了社会的冷酷与无情之外，好象就没有其他更有价值的东西似的。苏联作家则极不习惯于这种孤独的生活，人民也不允许他们沉默；这种是否为人民所需要的感情，是决定苏联艺术家们幸福或痛苦的主要因素。这样，一方面是资产阶级作家的孤独特性，而另一方面是苏联作家对社会事业的热情。
    由于“人民”是社会主义国家一切的主人，同时也成了“文学”的主人。人民有充分的理由要求合于他们自己口味的文学，所以就产生了作家创作的“从属性”，因为只有体验到为人民所需要的感情才是最幸福的。无条件地服从人民的要求可以开辟文学的广大园地，所以“文学”在苏联就有一连串的重要任务：保护人民的利益、教育人民、展望他们的未来、无情批判一切通向共产主义社会道路上的障碍，还有，填满人类心灵地图上的一切白点。
    资产阶级作家以“缺乏独立性”的眼光去藐视苏联的作家，却忘记了他们自己的庸俗文学永远以金钱为对象的死症上。苏联文学之所以不同于资本主义社会中最流行的三等作品而处于原则上不同的、庄重而重要的地位，显然就是伟大的“从属性”之赐。
    文学的民族性、群众性（通俗性、社会性。）及它传播于人民中之事实，就是新美学的标准，用这个标准去创造出来的作品才享有获得广大读者的客观可能性。它同时是批评一部艺术作品的武器。“只有那些既为广大群众所喜见乐闻而同时又使最有教养的、最有文化的知识界代表们也同样感到兴趣的作品，才是最高艺术技巧的范例。”
    作家常常是个旅行者，而苏维埃文学则是第一次穿过没有开垦过的土地的成果：“新的社会原则，新的评价人们的标尺，对于社会义务与私人义务的新的理解，新的道德，对于金钱、生活福利，对人的尊敬及对人生的目的底新的态度。”这种填满地图上的白点几乎是苏联作家的共同任务：“无论你有多少问题未获解决，你，苏维埃作家，务必首先解决首要的问题。选择一个英雄来写：这个人如何表现出正是新社会中所有的人格，他为这个社会做了什么？他因什么而在这个社会中受到尊重？”正因为如此，“绝大多数苏维埃作家都认为文学不是只和自己狭隘的个人文学爱好相关联的个人主义的事业，而是与全体人民向整个文学所提出的任务相关联的集体主义的事业。”
    资产阶级作家以“缺少对美学问题、形式问题的兴趣”去责难苏维埃作家，这恰巧说明他们自己对文学认识的狭隘性：以为把文学作品变得使人难于了解的形式才堪赞美。与此相反，苏联作家们认为“深刻、简单、明了”才是最高的艺术形式，只有这样才能使某一作家的作品变成为全体人民的作品。西蒙诺夫说：
    我们不是孤独的人，我们的心和人民在一起，而因此感到自己是全民整体中的一分子。
    “我们以这种从属性为骄傲，因为它是自由的最高表现。而且无论什么时候，无论什么代价，我们都不肯交换它的。”
    这就是，苏维埃作家已经怎样把文艺和国家的利益紧紧的结合了起来，而且发出了崭新的、伟大的苏联文学的光辉。
    它同样指出了我们文艺的正确道路。
