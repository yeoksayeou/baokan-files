　　Good Mother

　　At a grand gathering of soldiers and civilians, the 402nd Regiment of the Fourth Field Army presented a silk red banner of "Good Mother" to Old Lady Wang, who had come from 400 li away to visit her son.

　　Old Lady Wang is a model military dependent. She is the mother of Wang Zhenzhang, the bugle major of the headquarters of the 402nd Regiment. She is forty-nine years old this year and is the leader of a Communist Party branch group and the vice-director of the village women's association in a village in Wuqiang County, Hebei. She has not seen her son for eleven years. She was very happy to hear the news of her son entering the pass and walked from home to the garrison to see him. Although the old mother had been separated from her son for so long, she only stayed for one night before returning. She has always been concerned about the affairs of the village. The village is now preparing for spring plowing and needs her to return to work.

　　She is not only a good mother but also a good cadre and a good party member. She pays close attention to learning the Communist Party's leadership methods. She often says to people, "Leadership work must rely on political persuasion and follow the mass line." She actively takes the lead in implementing the Party's policies. After she was elected as the leader of the Party group, she cultivated five active farmers to become Communist Party members in ten months. The Communist Party group she leads is a successful leading core in the village. As soon as Old Lady Wang arrived at the troop, she immediately inquired about her son's performance from the soldiers and cadres. She was very happy to hear everyone say that Wang Zhenzhang was "very good" and said, "Then I am relieved." But when she learned that her son had joined the Party for a shorter time than herself, she wore an unhappy expression: "You are not as progressive as your old mother!"

　　Between her and her son, there is not only the love between mother and son, but also the deep love of proletarian comrades. She rebuked Wang Zhenzhang and said: "Your brother is a labor model at home. He is always first or second in every village election of models. You are not as active as your brother. The most important thing for a party member is to take the lead in everything and not be afraid of hardship." These words hit Wang Zhenzhang's shortcomings. At the gala, Wang Zhenzhang said: "I am determined to resolutely overcome the past problems of complaining, grumbling, fearing hardship, and not studying, and strive to perform meritorious service for the people during the Yangtze River Crossing Campaign." Old Lady Wang became happy then and said repeatedly: "That's right! That's right!"

　　She repeatedly urged her son: "Don't forget the days when your mother took you begging for food. Your father didn't even have a coffin when he died. Now our family has houses and land. During the New Year, the government also sends meat and noodles and hangs honorary plaques. We have truly turned ourselves over; but don't forget that the people of Jiangnan have not yet been liberated! We must work hard to liberate all of China, that's the only way to be worthy of the Party and the people." She instructed the soldiers of the regiment: "Work hard to cross the Yangtze River and completely eliminate the reactionary army; I will improve production in the rear. We must thoroughly wipe out Chiang Kai-shek's diehards and not let him harm the people again." The brothers in the regiment asked her to stay for a few more days, but she was afraid of delaying her work, so she happily went back the next day.

　　好母亲
    在一个盛大军民的联欢会上，第四野战军四○二团，把一面“好母亲”的锦缎红旗，献给从四百里外来看望儿子的王老太太。
    王老太太是一位模范军属，她就是四○二团团部司号长王振章的母亲。今年四十九岁，她是河北武强县一个村的共产党支部的小组长，和村妇女会副主任。她已有十一年没有看到她的儿子。她听到儿子进关的消息，非常高兴，从家里步行到驻地来看看他。老母亲虽然和儿子分开这么久，可是她只驻一宿就回去了。她一直惦记着村里的事情，现在村里正在准备春耕，需要她回去工作。
    她不但是一个好母亲，而且是一位好干部好党员。她很注意学习共产党的领导方法。她经常对人说：“领导工作要靠政治说服，走群众路线才行”。她积极带头执行党的政策。在她被选成党的小组长以后，十个月中，就培养了五个积极工作的农民成为共产党员。她领导的共产党小组，是村中一个有成绩的领导核心。王老太太一到部队，马上就向战士干部打听儿子的表现。听到大家反映王振章“很好”她很高兴的说：“这样我就放心了。”可是当她知道儿子入党的时间，比自己还短，她便带着不高兴的神情：“你还不如你的老母亲进步哪！”
    她和儿子中间，不仅仅是母子间的爱，而且深透着无产阶级同志的爱。她责备王振章说：“你兄弟在家是个劳动模范，每次村里选举模范，他总是第一二名，你还不如你兄弟积极。作党员最重要的是事事要带头，不怕吃苦。”这些话正说到王振章的缺点上。在联欢大会上，王振章表示：“决心要坚决克服过去讲怪话、发牢骚、怕吃苦、不学习的毛病，争取在渡江作战时，为人民立功。”王老太太这才快乐起来，连说：“这才对！这才对！”
    她再三叮属儿子说：“不要忘记妈妈带你讨饭的日子，你父亲死时都没有棺材装，现在咱们家有房有地了。过年时，政府还给送肉送面，挂光荣牌，真是翻身了；可别忘了江南老百姓还没有解放哪！还得努力解放全中国，这才对得起党和人民。”她叮嘱团部的战士们说：“努力打过长江去，干净消灭反动军队；我在后方要把生产提高起来。对蒋介石死党一定要剿平除根，不让他再来祸害人民。”团里弟兄们留她多住几天，她怕耽误工作，第二天就高高兴兴的回去了。
