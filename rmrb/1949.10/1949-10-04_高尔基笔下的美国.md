　　Gorky's America
    By Su. E. Sarcoff, Translated by He Jiahaui

    Among Gorky's works criticizing capitalism, those essays and pamphlets on America are most likely to attract our attention today. These articles, written more than forty years ago, are a powerful condemnation of the atrocities of the American capitalist system. Although these wonderful pages have appeared for a long time, their significance has not diminished in the slightest, but on the contrary, their correctness has become increasingly apparent. Countless facts about events that have occurred in the United States in the recent period can be used to prove any of Gorky's essays; because since Gorky left the United States, the infamous and notorious "American way of life" has become increasingly sinister, and its brutal atrocities have become increasingly rampant and undisguised.

    Twenty years ago, in response to questions raised by an American magazine, Gorky said: "That thing you call American culture not only does not and cannot get my sympathy. I think your culture is the ugliest on this planet, because it has expanded all the ugly and shameless factors of European culture to a terrible degree."

    These stern and angry words are the natural conclusion of all the great writer's remarks about capitalist America throughout his life.

    A profound and resolute critic of capitalism, a passionate and loyal proletarian revolutionary—Gorky always returned to the topic of America. In the social structure of the United States, he correctly saw a high concentration of various typical contradictions of a capitalist social system. Gorky strived to awaken the working class to liberate itself from exploitation and cruel oppression. He passionately warned people that the bourgeoisie was attempting to create new war disasters, to avoid this danger, and constantly pointed out that this American-style "capitalist ichthyosaur" (I chthyosaurus of capitalism) was the mortal enemy of progress and democracy. He called the Republic of Mammon, which was praised by countless lowly bourgeois writers, the kingdom of the "Yellow Devil." He indignantly and sharply criticized those American industrial centers, saying that they were like huge crucibles that "melted people into gold"; he also fiercely criticized the capitalist exploitation that "increasingly nakedly and shamelessly turned into a predatory system"; criticized racial discrimination; criticized those American merchants for their hatred of art and culture, saying that they were executioners who strangled "truth, freedom, reason, and any sacred things"—anything that an honest person who had not been overwhelmed by the power of Mammon believed in.

    The various facts that Gorky based his work on are incomparably rich in content in terms of their depth and analytical significance, and can indeed be said to be "inexhaustible." His evaluations and descriptions of capitalist America are extremely persuasive and truthful. They reveal and affirm a simple truth: that the ruthless attack on the barbaric system of American capitalism is enough to awaken the democratic forces of the world to rise up against the Wall Street robber barons to defend culture.

    This writer not only limited himself to exposing the inhumane and beastly American way of life, but further developed his superficial criticism of American culture into an in-depth analysis of the class relations on which that culture depended. He powerfully attacked the "foundation of the foundation" of the American capitalist system, proving that the "mad clamor" that permeated the skyscrapers of New York was inevitable and unavoidable in a country with the strange phenomenon of humans enslaving humans. Gorky showed how terrible American life was, and pointed out how terrible a threat the evil aggressive tendencies that were maturing in the American financial tycoons and shameless politicians were to humanity. The picture he drew is the most eloquent proof of these words of Lenin: "...Nowhere...is the power of capital, the power of a small number of wealthy families ruling the entire society, as brutal and obvious as in America." Because Gorky's essays and pamphlets on America are filled with a correct understanding of this characteristic of the irreconcilable contradictions of capitalism, these works can indeed give us lofty inspiration and powerful encouragement when the destructive forces of American imperialism are openly manifested in the various crimes of the war-mongers.

    The great writer first saw this "city of the Yellow Devil" in 1906. At that time, he had already closely linked himself with the Bolshevik Party through his art and his heroic struggle against autocracy during the 1905 Revolution.

    Gorky went to the United States with revolutionary enthusiasm. He was sent there by the Bolshevik Party to publicize the truth about the first Russian Revolution. His revolutionary enthusiasm shines like a flame in his "My Interview" and the collection of essays "In America."

    The American reactionaries all rose up against Gorky. These reactionaries began to want to expel Gorky from the country on "legal grounds." When they found that they could not falsely accuse Gorky's works of being "anarchist propaganda," the writer was defamed and squeezed out by their newspapers, surrounded and suffocated by the poisonous fog of baseless rumors; not a single New York publisher was willing to print Gorky's faithful report on the Russian Revolution.

    What shocked Gorky the most was that in the United States, the atrocity of destroying people's self-esteem and creativity was a common and public fact. In his opinion, the streets of New York were like "cunning, greedy throats, with the black city food floating in its depths—living people. Everywhere—above, below, on both sides, the sound of iron rang out clangorously, singing the paean of iron. Produced and encouraged by the power of money, it firmly nets people, suffocates them, strangles them, sucks their blood and brains, devours their muscles and nerves, and gradually makes itself fat, standing on silent stones, constantly stretching out its shackles and chains."

    For those who were thrown into the capitalist hell, he thought it was a "terrible and painful thing to mention." People were being devastated, ravaged, deprived of their souls, and they had long lost the ability to control the noisy, banging iron and stone mountains day and night. They had been reduced to such a miserable state that they had become appendages of the great technology they had created with their own hands, and their whole body and mind were subject to its domination and enslavement. Those big cities seemed to be "stomachs made of iron and stone, which had swallowed tens of billions of people and were chewing and digesting them."

    When he told us that the people of the United States were no longer the masters of their own destiny, but had become "blind tools in the hands of the Yellow Devil—Gold," his words pulsed with deep sympathy for the working masses of the United States, and revealed the warmth and brotherly friendship for the victims of capitalist exploitation. He said that they no longer had the ability to weave "beautiful and bold bonds" of thought, and could not "weave a heroic and glorious dream." In this country, according to the author's painful conclusion, people are nothing more than gold mines that can be mined for gold, and so-called "progress" is nothing more than the concentration of the physical strength of the working masses, nothing more than the crystallization of all their flesh, bones, and nerves into gold.

    As an artist who is particularly sensitive to the poetry of free creation, Gorky was also filled with hatred for the so-called technology in capitalist cities. The appearance of New York, with its grotesque ugliness, suppressed people's imagination. "Twenty-story buildings, dark, silent skyscrapers, stand majestically on the shore. In the ugly and vulgar squares, solid and heavy buildings stand gloomily and dimly. Although it tries its best to flaunt its height, ugliness can be felt in every house." The construction of this city is only for destruction, not for people's happiness and well-being. The tragic image of this "cursed and painful city" flashed through the reader's mind like a nightmare: pale, rachitic children, workers with "empty eyes" exhausted by overwork, and countless scenes of desperate poverty. "I have witnessed many extremely poor people," Gorky wrote, "and their anemic, emaciated, and sallow faces are very familiar to me. ...But the poverty scene in New York's East End is the most terrifying and tragic picture I know." In this "fundamentally unbeautiful" place, where even joy is mechanized, standardized, and sold cheaply, and where the atmosphere is full of melancholy, extinguishing thoughts like throwing wet rags on the last embers, life in this "gloomy and despicable kingdom" is like "a huge but crowded prison"; and the lonely and desolate lament for the vitality destroyed by the power of money floats over this huge prison.

    Gorky enthusiastically wanted to discover through this "despicable life" a person who was not yet dead at heart, who still had fresh feelings and vitality in this dark trap of the metropolis. "Inner freedom—spiritual freedom, does not shine in the eyes of these people!" Gorky indignantly accused in this way. Everywhere there is poverty, large-scale poverty, misery and despair. It is impossible to read Gorky's articles describing the slums of New York without trembling. One scene more terrifying than another makes people stunned with surprise and pity. This writer described the children of New York like this: "In these streets as crowded as flour bags, the children greedily searched for rotten, completely moldy vegetables in the garbage heaps by the side of the street, and devoured them on the spot in that terrible dust and heat...Like a flock of greedy pigeons, they flocked to the sidewalks; at one o'clock, two o'clock, or even later at night, they were still constantly digging and searching in that filthy, extremely hateful pile of germs; this is really a living satire and shame for the greedy miser." The adults "flock to the mud ditches of life, shoulder to shoulder, crowding each other, like waste floating in the turbid current; they are completely driven by hunger, and always want to pursue a full meal, which is their life goal." As for their family life, it is "in filthy and narrow rooms, the dim light of iron bed frames shines, and ragged clothes are piled on the iron beds; dirty and thorough pottery, and leftover food on the table."

    Gorky dipped his pen in the "abscess of the city" to reveal its tragic truth. In the voice of this great writer, there is not only pain and pity, but also passionate calls for resistance and struggle. He always passionately dreams of a character who can "smash and eliminate any unreasonable phenomenon, hateful things... and suppress the barbarous and rude clamor of steel." At this time, he began the masterpiece depicting the heroes of the Russian Revolution—his novel "Mother." The author of "Danko" and "The Stormy Petrel" felt very surprised by the phenomenon of "residents of this city of the Yellow Devil enduring all adversities without resistance." He asked them to understand the great truth that has been grasped by their Russian brothers, this truth tells people that only the laborers are the masters of life, because "life is for them, and everything that hinders their survival will inevitably be eliminated."

    All his essays are illuminated by this great truth. His sharp and strict criticism powerfully encouraged the working masses of the United States to dare to rise up and break free from the oppression and domination of the Yellow Devil, stand up and fight for the human rights that had been ravaged by the capitalists.

    In a pamphlet called "One of the Kings of the Republic," Gorky vividly described "those who hinder the workers from living."

    In response to the questions of the aforementioned American magazine, Gorky also wrote: "The capitalists of all countries are equally cruel and equally hateful, but your capitalists are particularly bad. Obviously, they are more shameless and stupidly greedy." In order to illustrate these words spoken as early as 1929, we can use this extremely wonderful pamphlet "One of the Kings of the Republic"—this fierce and powerful anti-imperialist work against the rulers of modern America. This pamphlet describes a tyrant among those incomparably reactionary imperialists who should be opposed by the people.

    This character is depicted as a cruel and barbaric incarnation and symbol of capitalism, with deep hatred for anything full of life and humanity. In world literature, there are few works that expose the ugliness of capitalism as deeply and powerfully as Gorky's pamphlets; from this pamphlet, we can see a "corpse" that poisons the lives of millions of people with its stench.

    At the beginning of the pamphlet, the author uses a satirical tone, saying that whenever he imagines a real capitalist image, he always depicts him as a "huge monster" that does not need a head at all, but only needs muscles and bones that can squeeze gold out of anything. Although the real American financial tycoons that Gorky saw seemed to have little similarity to this exaggerated description on the surface, they were indeed like this in essence. There is undoubtedly something terrible about this well-educated gentleman.

    The most prominent characteristic that Gorky saw in the uncrowned king of the North American Republic was that he had "a pair of incredibly long and retractable arms. They have tightly grasped the entire earth in their hands, and put it into that dark and cavernous mouth that sucks, gnaws, chews, and swallows our earth as if it were a baked potato..." Who can describe the aggressive madness of American imperialism more powerfully! "I imagine the American capitalist's pocket as a bottomless hole, into which even a church, a senate, and all necessities can be stuffed..." Gorky satirized and mocked the giants of Wall Street in this way, exposing their ambitions to dominate the world. Forty years ago, he had already heard a kind of startling "melody" in the "mad clamor" of American life; this "tune" has today developed into a deafening roar in the "Marshall Plan" and the "North Atlantic Treaty"—the roar of war. The "king" in Gorky's pen simply declared in a tone suitable for Dulles or Vandenberg: "The United States is the best country in the world... Americans are the best people in the world. They are the richest. No one else is as rich as we are. That is why the whole world must follow us immediately..."

    Although more than forty years have passed, these articles are as if they were just written. It seems that the words above were not spoken by the "King of the Republic," but by the merchants in the American Senate and stock exchange today. Of course, today's American overlords speak much more "smoothly" and skillfully; they have not spent these years in vain. In some respects, the millionaire in Gorky's pen seems to be unable to catch up with today's "Kings of the Republic," falling behind today's financial giants. For example, at that time, the American millionaires were satisfied as long as the "good boys" in the White House obediently listened and tamely did not interfere with the interests of the bosses; but today's Harrimans and Forrestals have gone a step further, they have personally occupied all the key positions and seized political power, so as to complete their endless aggressive plans more perfectly and smoothly.

    The "King of the Republic" in Gorky's pen also has very sensitive fingers and vast power to do whatever he wants, and he is as shameless as Hoover. Even in the face of the facts that made the two American visitors that Gorky wrote about in 1932 blush and had to admit, he did not lose his composure and remained calm. Those two visitors confessed: "When we were in Europe, we really felt very painful, because Europeans hated us." Since then, the people's hatred for American political families has indeed increased a hundredfold.

    The value of Gorky's essays and pamphlets lies in the fact that once he exposes it, we can discover that this ugly American culture is historically destined to be eliminated.

    Gorky exposed the reactionary essence of the American political and social system, tore off the mask of the "American God," and completely exposed its evil nature. The myths of American "democracy" and "culture" were all eliminated by his pen, and the so-called "American way of life," which was always boasted by the yellow Howard newspaper system, gradually and completely revealed its decadent and ugly poverty. Morality? Gorky fiercely attacked the morality that only protects the interests of capitalists, saying: "You deploy a large number of police and secret agents on the streets, and at the same time instill a lot of moral concepts into people's minds, and make them take root there, so that you can crush, strangle, and eliminate all ideals that are unfavorable to you and all wishes that are enough to endanger your power." Religion? "This is needed for the poor... Religion is lubricant. The more oil we use on the machine of life, the less friction and the more coordination each part has." Art? This is of course also needed, because "if everyone publishes advertisements in rhyme, then life will become very interesting... Art must be very interesting... The brain sometimes needs rest, needs a sedative... and sometimes the body needs a stimulant." Literature? Only two books are recognized: "The Bible" and "The General Ledger"... "They can all excite the spirit. As soon as you pick them up, you will feel that there is a mysterious power in them that can satisfy any of your requirements." Democracy? Naturally, "Americans always have a habit of being proud that even a newspaper vendor in the United States can become president. In order to remind you of this, I only want to point out the intelligence of the newspaper vendors, not the talent of the presidents—I happen to know nothing about the latter's talent."

    Gorky's essays often remind people of Lenin's famous saying—he pointed out that the so-called American "democracy," "...is nothing but the freedom to preach in the interests of the bourgeoisie, that is to say, they have the sacred freedom to propagate the most reactionary ideas, religion, obscurantism, and protect the exploiters, etc."

    This great writer described in detail the machine of deceiving the people that capitalists cleverly used for their own interests. This includes inhuman labor, the constant threat of unemployment, the constant preaching of corrupt bourgeois morality, the propagation of religion, and, most importantly, the use of the private concepts of those thugs who have been corrupted by bourgeois morality to make trouble everywhere. When we read how cleverly the American bourgeoisie encourages the cruelty and atrocities of the thugs, we can know that the soil for the growth of fascist germs has long been prepared in the United States. On this point, Gorky's close attention to the various crimes and atrocities that are constantly developing in the United States, and the collection of all evidence, is of particular significance. He emphatically pointed out this fact: the system itself is the foundation of these atrocities, and the organic connection between these atrocities and the inherent crimes of capitalist economy is also established by this system itself. Gorky correctly saw that the fact that Sam's land was increasingly becoming a den of thieves and was covered with powerful criminal networks was a significant sign of the impending collapse of the American capitalist social system. Therefore, he carefully studied the shocking case of Al Capone and the report of the famous Wickersham Commission, and came to the conclusion: in almost all major cities in the United States, there is obviously an alliance between the police and the criminals, and they collude and collude in all crimes.

    "The capitalist world is about to perish, it is dying." Gorky wrote in one of his essays. This is the central idea of all of Gorky's writings on America. These works are filled with the author's firm belief: a social system like this that brings about the terrible phenomenon of human enslaving humans has no other way out than destruction and retreat before the revolutionary forces of democracy and progress. Therefore, although those habitual liar bourgeois politicians talk about what "prosperity," the power of technology, and a high degree of material civilization, Gorky resolutely and mercilessly exposed the terrible rotten sores that corroded the important organs of all capitalist systems.

    "The exhaustion of the masses," he wrote in one of his essays, "is equal to the exhaustion of the soil on which culture depends to grow." According to Gorky's description, capitalist culture is only a barbaric culture, which completely negates the "basic conditions" of democracy: the freedom of independent thought, the freedom of labor, and the freedom of belief. Gorky has repeatedly pointed out: "The bourgeoisie is hostile to culture, and it cannot be anything else—this is a truth confirmed by the bourgeoisie's own status quo." His analysis of American culture completely proves this conclusion. We see clearly that the United States is indeed a garden that cultivates spiritual poverty, arrogant ignorance, and primitive prejudices. On this point, Gorky's thorough criticism of the formalistic and unmoving American music is so meaningful! He called it "the music of the fat cats." He, a proletarian revolutionary, also frequently and vehemently opposed the atrocities of racial discrimination that had become very common in the United States. He angrily spoke of those "white barbarians" who tortured black people with lynchings, and called on everyone to take revenge on those senior officials who electrocuted innocent people just because their skin was black.

    As early as the 1930s, he shouted in one of his articles: "Imagine how stupid and shameful this is: this strange world of ours, which we have worked so hard to create... is now in the clutches of some waste products who can only make money and have no other use! These greedy waste products occupy the brilliant creative power—the scientists, technicians, poets, and cultural builders such as workers, turn this our 'second natural mother' into small pieces of gold coins and checks."

    Gorky's essays on America are filled with passionate calls to rise up and eliminate the power of these "idiots." His power to hate capitalism comes from his power to love the working class. The pen of this great writer fully reveals his friendship for those who fight for human freedom and happiness.

    Gorky's essays on America are an undeniable proof. When he firmly opposed the exploiters, he also seriously praised and respected those American writers, scientists, and progressive activists who resisted the reactionary forces. He always separated the American financial magnates and their lackeys from the American people.

    In 1929, when a yellow newspaper asked Gorky if he really hated the American people, the great writer angrily refuted this despicable provocation.

    Gorky's noble and self-sacrificing hard work has greatly enhanced the ideology of the warriors fighting for democracy and progress all over the world and promoted their unity.

    In Gorky's sketches, short essays, and pamphlets, the voice of this great writer praising the Soviet people resounds, because he is proud and honored of the people who have pointed out the path to freedom and happiness for all mankind.

### 高尔基笔下的美国

　　高尔基笔下的美国
    苏·Е·萨尔珂夫作  何家槐译
    在高尔基抨击资本主义的著作中，今天最能引起我们注意的，是他那些论美国的论文和小册子。远在四十多年前写的这些文章，乃是谴责美国资本主义制度暴行的有力控诉。这些精彩的篇页虽则已经出现了很久，可是它们的意义不但丝毫没有减少，而且恰恰相反地日益增加其正确性。无数关于最近一个时期内发生于美国的事实，都可用以证明高尔基的任何一篇论文；因为自从高尔基离开美国以后，那罪恶昭彰，声明狼藉的“美国生活方式”，已经日益显出了狰狞的面目，它那残酷不仁的暴行已经日益肆无忌惮，毫不掩饰了。
    二十年前，在答复一家美国杂志提出的问题时，高尔基曾经说道：“你所称为美国文化的这一种东西，不但没有而且也不可能得到我的同情。我以为你们的文化，是我们这座星球上面最丑恶的一种，因为它已把欧洲文化中所有丑恶无耻的因素，扩大到可怕的程度。”
    这些严峻的愤怒的话，是这伟大作家在其一生中关于资本主义美国所有言论的自然的结论。
    深刻而且坚决的资本主义批评家，热烈而且忠诚的无产阶级革命家——高尔基，时刻都回到美国这一论题。在美国的社会构造中，他很正确地看到一个资本主义社会制度的各种典型矛盾的高度集中。高尔基努力唤醒工人阶级要从剥削与残暴的压迫中解放自己。他热情地警告人们资产阶级正在企图造成新的战争灾难，要他们避免这一种危险，而且不断地指出这一美国式的“资本主义鱼龙”（Ｉ　ｃｈｔｈｙｏｓａｕｒｕｓ　ｏｆ　ｃａｐｉｔａｌｉｓｍ——按“鱼龙”为古生代的爬虫。）是进步与民主的死敌。他把为无数资产阶级的卑贱作家所歌颂的金元共和国，称做“黄色魔鬼”的王国。他很愤慨地和尖锐地抨击那些美国的工业中心，说它们犹如“把人民熔化成金”的大坩埚；他又猛烈地抨击那“日益赤裸裸地和傲慢无耻地变成了掠夺制度”的资本主义剥削；抨击种族的歧视；抨击那些美国商人对于艺术和文化，是如何的仇恨，说他们是绞杀“真理，自由，理性，和任何神圣的物事”——任何为一个不曾被金元势力所压倒的诚实的人所信仰的东西的刽子手。
    高尔基所根据的各种事实，在其深度和分析的意义上说，有其无比丰富的内容，的确可以说是“取之不竭用之不尽”的；他那些对于资本主义美国的评价和描写，极有说服力和真实性。它们揭示出而且肯定一种朴素的真理；这一真理，是对于美国资本主义野蛮制度的无情攻击，足以唤起全世界的民主势力，起来反对华尔街的强盗头子，以保卫文化。
    这位作家并不仅只限于揭露不人道的和兽性的美国生活方式，而且进一步地把他那对于美国文化的表面批评，发展而成对于为那文化所依存的阶级关系的深入的剖析。他有力地抨击美国资本主义制度的“基础的基础”，证明那弥漫在纽约摩天楼下面的“疯狂的喧扰”，在一个有人奴役人的怪现象的国度里是必然的，无可避免的。高尔基显示出美国生活是多么的可怕，而且指出那正在美国金融巨头和无耻政客中日益成熟起来的罪恶的侵略倾向，对于人类是一个如何可怕的威胁。他所描绘的图画，对于列宁下面这些话正是最雄辩的证明：“……没有一个地方……资本的权力，仅仅小数豪门统治整个社会的权力，是象美国这样的残暴和显而易见的腐败。”由于在高尔基论美国的论文和小册子中，都充满着对于资本主义无可调和的矛盾的这一特征的正确理解，所以当这美国帝国主义的破坏力量正在战争贩子们的各种罪行上公开表现出来的时候，这些著作确能给我们以崇高的启示和有力的鼓舞。
    这位伟大的作家初次见到这“黄色魔鬼的城市”，是在一九○六年。那时他已经用他的艺术和他那在一九○五年革命时期反对专制政治的英勇战斗，紧紧地和布尔什维克党联系在一起。
    高尔基带着革命的热情到了美国。他被布尔什维克党派到那儿去宣扬俄国第一次革命的真相。他的革命热情，在他那“我的访问”（Ｍｙ＇　Ｉｎｔｅｒｖｉｅｗ）和论文集“在美国”（ＩｎＡｍｅｒｉｃａ）中，象火焰一般的光辉灿烂地燃烧着。
    美国的反动分子一齐起来反对高尔基。这些反动派开始想以“合法的理由”根本驱逐高尔基出境。当他们发现不能诬赖高尔基的著作为“无政府主义的宣传”时，这位作家就又被他们的报纸所诋毁，所排挤，为无稽谣言的毒雾所包围，所窒息；竟没有一个纽约的出版家，肯承印高尔基关于俄国革命的忠实的报导。
    最使高尔基感到触目惊心的，就是在美国，毁灭人们自尊心和创造力的暴行已是司空见惯的公开事实。在他看来，纽约市街，就象是“狡滑的，贪婪的咽喉，在它的深处浮泛着黑色的城市食粮——活的人。无论那里——头上，脚下，两旁，都铿锵地鸣响着铁的声音，高唱着铁的凯歌。由于被金钱势力所产生和鼓舞，它把人们牢牢地网住，窒息他，绞杀他，吸吮他的血液和脑汁，吞噬他的肌肉和神经，因而渐渐地使自己肥大起来，屹立在无声的石块上面，不断地把它的镣铐和锁链伸展开去。”
    对于被投入资本主义地狱的人们，他认为是件“一提到就觉得可怕的和痛苦的事情”。人们遭受着摧残，遭受着蹂躏，被剥夺了灵魂，他们久已丧失了控制那喧嚣的，日夜砰击作声的铁石之山的能力。他们已经降到这样可怜的地步，竟变成了他们自己亲手创造的巨大技术的附属品，全身心都受着它的支配和奴役。那些大都市似乎都是“铁石构造而成的胃腹，已经吞食了几百亿的人民，而且正在咀嚼着和消化着他们。”
    当他告诉我们美国的人民不再是他们自己命运的主人，而已变成了“黄色魔鬼—黄金—掌握中的盲目工具”时，他的话语中跳动着对于美国劳苦大众的深刻的同情心，流露着对于资本主义剥削的牺牲者的温情和兄弟般的友谊。他说他们已经没有能力编缀思想的“美丽而又大胆的纽带”，不能“织造一个英勇而又辉煌的梦”。在这国度里的人民，根据作者的沉痛的结论，不过是可以采取黄金的金矿，所谓“进步”也者，也不过是劳苦大众的体力的集中，不过是把他们所有的肉体，骨骼，和神经结晶成黄金而已。
    对于自由创造的诗歌，一个艺术家本是特别敏感的，高尔基也满怀着对于资本主义都市中的所谓技术的憎厌。纽约的外表，以它的奇形怪状的丑态压抑着人们的想象力。“二十层的大厦，黑暗的沉默的摩天楼，巍然高耸在岸上。在丑陋的庸俗不堪的广场上，坚固的笨重的建筑物阴郁地幽暗地屹立着。它虽则极力炫耀着高度，但丑恶却在每一座房子里都可以感觉得到。”这城市的建设只是为着毁灭，却不是为着人们的快乐和幸福。这个“可咀咒的痛苦的都市”的悲惨形象，象一个恶梦似地闪过读者的心头：苍白的，患软骨症的，“神经被锈铁的尖锐啸声所震碎”的孩子们，带着由于过度劳动而涸竭了的“空虚的眼睛”的工人们，以及无数绝望的贫困的景象。“我曾经目击很多贫苦到极点的人，”高尔基写道，“他们那贫血的，消瘦憔悴的青黄脸色，对于我是非常熟悉的。……可是在纽约东头的贫困景象，却是我所知道的最恐怖和最悲惨的一幅图画。”在这“根本无美可言的”，就是欢乐也是被机械化，标准化，和贱价出卖的，到处都是充满着忧郁的气氛，扑灭思想象把湿的破布投向最后的余烬似的，“灰暗卑污的王国”中，生活是象“一个巨大然而拥挤的监狱”；而寂寞凄凉的，为金钱势力所摧残的生命力的哀歌，就是在这个巨大的监狱上空飘荡。
    高尔基热情地想通过这种“卑污的生活”发现一个尚未心死的，“在这大都市的黑暗陷阱中还有新鲜感觉和生命力的”人。“内心的自由——精神的自由，并不在这些人民的眼睛里闪光啊！”高尔基象这样似地愤慨地控诉。到处都是贫穷，大规模的贫穷，悲惨而且绝望。要读完高尔基描写纽约贫民的文章而不战栗，是不可能的。一个比一个还要可怕的镜头，使人因惊奇和怜悯而发呆。这位作家是这样的描写纽约孩子们：“在这些拥挤得和粉袋一样的街道上，孩子们贪馋地在街旁的垃圾堆里搜寻腐烂的，完全发霉了的疏菜，而且在那可怕的灰尘和炎热中当场狼吞虎咽地吃了起来……好象贪食的一群鸽子似地，他们麇集在人行道上；在深夜一点钟，两点钟，甚至更晚的时候，他们仍然在那污秽不堪的，极其可憎的贫乏的细菌堆里不断地挖掘着，搜求着；这实在是一个对于贪婪的守财奴的活生生的讽刺和耻辱。”大人们则“麇集在生活的泥沟里面，摩肩擦踵地互相拥挤着，象飘荡在浊流里的废物；他们完全受着饥饿的驱使，老是想追求一饱，这就是他们的人生目的。”至于他们的家庭生活，则“在污秽湫隘的房室里，闪耀着铁床架子的幽暗的光，铁床上面堆着乱七八糟的一些褴褛；肮脏透了的瓦器，还有桌子上的剩余食物。”
    高尔基把他的笔浸在“都市的浓疮”里，以揭露它的悲惨的真相。在这伟大作家的声音中，并不是只有痛苦和怜悯，而且也有热烈的，反抗与斗争的号召。他老是热情地梦想着一个能够“粉碎与消灭任何不合理的现象，可憎厌的事物……和镇压钢铁的野蛮粗鲁的喧嚣”的人物。这时他已开始那描写俄国革命英雄的杰作——他的小说“母亲”。这“唐珂”（Ｄａｎｋｏ）和“暴风雨中的海燕”的作者，对于“在这黄色魔鬼的城市里的居民毫无反抗地忍受一切横逆的命运”这一现象，感觉得非常吃惊。他要求他们去了解那个已为他们的俄国兄弟所掌握了的伟大真理，这一真理告诉人们只有劳动者才是生命的主人，因为“生活是为着他们的，一切妨碍他们生存的东西，都不免遭到消灭。”
    他的所有论文，都被这个伟大的真理所照明。他那尖锐严格的批评，很有力地鼓舞了美国的劳苦大众，使他们敢于起来摆脱那黄色魔鬼的压迫和支配，挺起腰来为那些曾被资本家们所蹂躏的人权而斗争。
    高尔基在一本叫做“共和国王之一”（Ｏｎｅ　ｏｆ　ｔｈｅ　Ｋｉｎｇｓ　ｏｆ　ｔｈｅ　Ｒｅｐｕｂｌｉｃ）的小册子中，曾有声有色地描写了“那些阻碍工人们生存的人”。
    在答复上述那家美国杂志的问题时，高尔基又曾写道：“所有国家的资本家都是同样的残酷，同样的可憎，但你们的资本家却特别的坏。很明显地，他们是更无耻而愚蠢地贪得无厌。”为了说明这些远在一九二九年所说的话，我们可以利用这个极其精彩的小册子“共和国王之一”——这个反对近代美国统治者的，激烈而且有力的反帝作品。这个小册子描写那些无比反动的，应该受到人民反对的帝国主义分子中的一个暴君。
    这个人物是被描写成残酷野蛮的，对任何富有生命与人性的事物，都有深仇大恨的资本主义的化身和象征。在世界文学中，很少有象高尔基的小册子这样深刻地和有力地暴露资本主义的丑恶的作品；从这小册子中我们可以看到一个以它的恶臭毒害着千百万人民生命的“腐尸”。
    作者在小册子的开端，就用着讽刺的口吻，说他无论在什么时候想象一个真实的资本家形象，总是把他描绘成一个根本不需要什么头颅，却只要有可以从任何东西上面压榨出金子来的筋骨就可以了的“庞大的怪物”。虽则高尔基所看到的真正的美国金融巨头，表面上看来与这夸张的形容极少类似之处，可是本质上却确是这样的。在这教养得很好的绅士身上，无疑的有些可怕的东西。
    高尔基在北美共和国的无冕之王身上看出的最显著的特征，就是他有“一双其长无比的，伸缩自如的手臂。它们已把整个地球紧紧地抓在自己手里，而且把它放进那个墨漆黑洞的，吮吸、咬啮、咀嚼、和吞咽我们的地球竟象是一个烤熟了的马铃薯似的巨嘴…”谁能把美国帝国主义的侵略狂描写得更为有力！“我想象美国资本家的口袋，是个无底洞，就是一个教堂、参议院、和一切必需品也都能装得进去……”高尔基就象这样似地讽刺着和嘲笑着华尔街的巨头们，暴露着他们妄想霸占全世界的野心。在四十年以前，他就已在美国生活的“疯狂的喧嚣”中听出了那一种使人吃惊的“旋律”；这一种“曲调”今天已在“马歇尔计划”和“北大西洋公约”中发展成为震耳欲聋的咆哮——战争的咆哮。高尔基笔下的“国王”，简直是以一种适合于杜拉斯（Ｄｕｌｌｅｓ）或范登堡的口吻宣称：“美国是世界上最好的国家……美国人是世界上最优秀的人民。他们最有钱。没有旁的人有象我们这样豪富的。这就是为什么全世界都要马上跟着我们走的缘故……”
    虽则四十多年已经过去了，但他这些文章却象是刚刚才写似的。仿佛上面那些话并非出诸“共和国王”之口，却倒象是今天美国参议院和证券交易所里的商人们所说的话。自然，今天的美国太上皇们说得“圆滑”和巧妙得多；他们并没有将这些年数白过。在某些方面，高尔基笔下的百万富翁似乎是赶不上今天的“共和国王们”，落在今天的金融巨头们之后了。倒如那时美国的百万富翁只要白宫里的“好孩子们”乖乖的听话，驯良地不去干预老板们的利益，就觉得满足了；而今天的哈利门们和福雷斯脱尔（Ｆｏｒｒｅｓｔａｌ）们，则更进了一步，他们已经亲自占据了所有的要津，掌握了政权，以便更美满和更顺利地完成他们那无止境的侵略计划。
    高尔基笔下的“共和国王”，也有非常敏感的手指和为所欲为的广大权力，而且也象胡佛一样地厚颜，即使在那一九三二年使得高尔基所写的两个美国访问者都觉得脸红而且不得不承认的事实前面，他也不曾失去镇静，态度自若。那两个访问者是这么招供的：“当我们在欧洲时，实在觉得很痛苦，因为欧洲人憎恨我们。”自从那时起，人民对于美国豪门政治的憎恨，的确已经增加百倍了。
    高尔基的论文和小册子的价值，是在于一经他的揭露，我们就可以发现这一丑恶不堪的美国文化，是历史上注定要消灭的。
    高尔基揭发美国政治制度和社会制度的反动本质，撒去“美国上帝”的假面具，让它的邪恶性质完全暴露出来。所谓美国“民主”和“文化”的神话，一个个地都在他的笔下消灭了，而那老是被黄色的霍华德系报纸所夸耀的所谓“美国生活方式”，也渐渐地完全暴露出它那一副堕落和丑恶的穷相。道德吗？高尔基猛烈地攻击那只是保护资本家利益的道德，他说：“你在街道上配置着大批警察和密探，同时也在人们的头脑里灌输进很多道德观念，而且使它们在那里生根，以便能够粉碎，绞杀，消灭所有对你不利的理想和所有足以危及你的权力的愿望。”宗教吗？“这对于穷苦的人是需要的……宗教是润滑油。我们在人生的机器上用油越多，那末各部分也越少摩擦，越能够协调。”艺术吗？这当然也是需要的，因为“如果人人都用韵文来刊登广告，那生活将变成非常有趣……艺术必需是很有趣的……脑子有时也需要休息，需要镇静剂……而有时身体则需要兴奋剂。”文学吗？只有两本书是被承认的：“圣经”和“总帐薄”……“它们都能够兴奋精神。你一拿起它们来，你就会觉得在它们里面有一种能够满足你的任何要求的神秘力量。”民主吗？自然，“美国人老是有一种以在美国即使是报贩子也可能做到总统这一事实而自豪的习惯。为了提醒你这件事情，我只想指出报贩子们的聪明，而非大总统们的天才——对于后者的才能，我恰巧是毫无所知。”
    高尔基的论文，常常使人记起列宁的名言——他曾指出所谓美国的“民主”，“……不是别的，而只是合于资产阶级利益的说教的自由，这就是说，他们有自由宣传最反动的思想，宗教，愚民政策，保护剥削者等等的神圣自由。”
    这伟大的作家，详细地描写了那只资本家们为了本身利益而巧妙地使用着的愚民机器。这包含着非人的劳动，不断的失业的威胁，腐败的资产阶级道德的经常说教，宗教的宣扬，而尤其重要的，是利用那些被资产阶级道德所腐化了的暴徒们的私有观念，到处闹乱子。当我们读了美国资产阶级是如何巧妙地鼓励着暴徒们的残酷和暴行以后，就可以知道在美国很久以前就已替法西斯毒菌准备了生长的土壤。在这一点上，高尔基密切地注视在美国不断地发展着的各种罪行和暴行，搜罗着所有的证据，是有特别的意义的。他强调地指出这一事实：制度本身就是这些暴行的基础，在这些暴行和资本主义经济所原有的罪恶之间的有机连系，也是这个制度自己建立的。高尔基很正确地看出山姆大的土地日益变成了盗贼窝和布满了强有力的罪恶网这一事实，是美国资本主义社会制度面临崩溃的显著征候。因此他曾仔细地研究了那骇人听闻的阿尔·卡蓬（Ａｌ　Ｃａｐｏｎｅ）的案子和那著名的威克逊委员会（Ｗｉｃｋｅｒｓｈａｍ　Ｃｏｍｍｉｓｓｉｏｎ）的报告，而且得出了结论：几乎在美国的所有大都市里，都很明显地存在着一个警察与犯罪者们所结成的联盟，什么罪恶都是他们狼狈为奸，串同作弊的。
    “资本主义世界快要灭亡了，它已是奄奄一息。”高尔基曾在他的一篇论文中这样写道。这是高尔基关于美国的所有著作的中心思想。这些著作中都充满着作者的坚强信念：象这样带来人奴役人的可怕现象的社会制度，除了毁灭和在民主与进步的革命力量前退让步外，是再也没有其他出路的。因此，虽然那些惯于说谎的资产阶级政论家们妄谈什么“繁荣”，技术的力量，和高度的物质文明，高尔基却毫不容情地坚决揭露那些腐蚀着所有资本主义制度的重要器官的可怕的烂疮。
    “人民大众的涸竭，”他在一篇论文中写道：“即等于文化所赖以生长的土壤的涸竭。”根据高尔基的描写，资本主义文化只是一种野蛮的文化，它完全否定了民主的“起码条件”：独立思想的自由，劳动的自由，信仰的自由。高尔基曾经一再指出：“资产阶级是敌对文化的，除此以外，它也再不能成为别的东西——这是一个为资产阶级自己的现状所证实了的真理。”他那对于美国文化的分析，完全证明了这个结论。我们看明白了美国确是培植精神的贫乏，狂妄的无知，和原始的成见岁的园地。在这一点上说，高尔基对于徒具形式的，毫不动人的美国音乐的彻底批评，是多么的有意义！他称它为“大腹贾的音乐”。他，一个无产阶级的革命家，又经常地激烈反对那在美国已经十分普遍了的种族歧视的暴行。他愤怒地说到那些私刑拷打黑人的“白色蛮子”，号召大家起来向那些只不过由于皮肤黑色而就叫无辜的人受电刑的高级官吏们实行报复。
    早在三十年代时，他就曾在他的一篇文章中大声疾呼：“试想这是如何的愚蠢和可耻：我们这一个奇异的，我们曾经如此惨澹经营的世界……现在却落入了一些只会赚钱而毫无其他用处的废料的魔掌之中！这些贪婪的废料，占取了辉煌的创造力量——科学家，技术专家，诗人，和工人等等文化建设者的心血，把这个我们的‘第二自然母亲’变成了小片小片的金币和一张张的支票。”
    在高尔基论美国的文章中，都充满着鼓舞大家起来消灭这些“草包”们的权力的热情的号召。他那憎恨资本主义的力量，是从他那热爱工人阶级的力量中产生出来的。这个伟大作家的笔下，充分流露出他对于那些为了争取人类自由和幸福的战斗者的友情。
    高尔基论美国的文章，就是一个无可争辩的证据。当他坚决地反对剥削者的时候，同时却以严肃的态度，赞扬和尊敬那些反抗反动势力的美国作家、科学家、和进步的活动分子。他始终都是把美国财阀及其爪牙们和美国的人民分开来看待的。
    在一九二九年，当一家黄色报纸询问高尔基是不是真的憎恨美国人民时，对于这一卑劣的挑拨，这伟大的作家加以愤怒的驳斥。
    高尔基的崇高的自我牺牲的辛勤工作，已经大大地提高了全世界为了争取民主和进步而奋斗的战士们的思想性，促进了他们的团结。
    在高尔基的速写，短论，和小册子中，回响着这个伟大作家赞扬苏联人民的声音，因为他是以那给全人类指出了自由与幸福之路的人民，而感到骄傲与光荣的。
