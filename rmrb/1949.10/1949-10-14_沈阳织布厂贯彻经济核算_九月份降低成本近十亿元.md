Shenyang Textile Factory Implements Economic Accounting
September Cost Reduction Nears One Billion Yuan
[Shenyang News] The Shenyang Textile Factory, in implementing an economic accounting system, has increased production and continued to save costs. In September, the factory produced 10,584 bolts of cloth (averaging 228 machines operating daily), exceeding the planned target of 10,100 bolts by 4.8 percent. The average daily output in the last ten days of the month was 418 bolts, an increase of 17 percent compared to the average of 357 bolts per day in the first and middle ten days; the rate of second-grade cloth decreased from 6.4 percent to 5.4 percent. In addition, the factory saved a total of 966.644 million yuan in costs in September, including 528.6 million yuan in raw material costs, 137.3477 million yuan in labor costs, and 30.493 million yuan in manufacturing and management costs. The standard quota for raw material loss was set at 2.55 percent, but the actual loss was only 0.98 percent, saving 2,643 pounds of cotton yarn. Workers are consciously paying attention to conservation. For example, in the thread-winding and small bobbin groups, each person used to lose 0.7 to 1 pound of thread per ten bundles wound, but now the loss is only 0.25 pounds. At the end of each day, everyone's waste thread is weighed and the results are announced, with a black, blue, and red dot reward and punishment system implemented. Furthermore, the workers in the warp sizing group previously used only six strands when tying the machine heads for convenience, resulting in large gaps and wasting a lot of warp thread when putting it on the beam. Now, the workers are automatically dividing it into twelve strands, which saves four yards of warp thread per beam. At the same time, when tying the beam, they use waste thread to connect a section first, which can save one yard of warp thread when the beam is woven. The workers in the reed drawing group have reduced the residual thread on the sizing shaft from six pounds to two pounds by paying attention to the yardage when the machine stops. The workers in the weaving shop used to use waste thread from the machines to wipe the machine tables, but now they use it to make splicing thread. In terms of personnel, the workshop affairs and management personnel, etc., have saved 22 people according to the quota, saving 40 million yuan. In addition to the above achievements, the shortcomings are that the supply of raw materials still lacks planning, and the control of raw materials is insufficient, resulting in temporary grabbing. Secondly, production efficiency has not been fully realized. According to recent surveys: canvas is at 66 percent, three-twill is at 70 percent, and four-twill is at 72 to 80 percent. In addition to poor production equipment, the main reason is the failure to allocate machine stations according to technical level, insufficient coordination between departments, with some being busy and others idle, as well as insufficient political education, with the labor enthusiasm of some workers not high enough. The factory is now organizing a research group to make reasonable improvements.

　　沈阳织布厂贯彻经济核算
    九月份降低成本近十亿元
    【沈阳讯】沈阳织布厂，贯彻经济核算制，生产提高，继续节约成本。九月份该厂生产了一万零五百八十四匹布（平均每天开二百二十八台机），超过规定任务一万零一百匹的百分之四·八。下旬每天平均产量四百十八匹，较上中两旬每天三百五十七匹增加百分之十七；次布由百分之六·四，降低到百分之五·四。此外，九月份共节约成本九亿六千六百四十四万元。计原料费五亿二千八百六十万元；人工费一亿三千七百三十四万七千元，制造费和管理费共三亿零四十九万三千元。原料的损耗量标准定额是百分之二·五五，实际损耗仅百分之○·九八，计节省棉纱二、六四三磅。工友都自觉注意节约，如捣线和小穗组，以前每人捣十捆线损耗○·七磅至一磅，现在损耗仅为○·二五磅，每天下工时每个人的乱线都要过秤，并公布成绩，实行黑蓝红点的奖惩制度。另如浆纱组工友，以前图简便拴机头时仅分成六缕，距离空隙很大，上轴时浪费很多经线，现在工友自动分成十二缕，每个轴可以节省四码经线；同时在拴轴时，利用乱线先接上一段，到织布了轴时，可以节省一码经线。拉条组工友，由于注意了了机时的码数，浆纱轴剩线已经由六磅减少到二磅。织布场工友，以前经常用了机的乱线擦机台，现在都利用做接头线。人员方面，工场事务和管理人员等，按定额节省二十二名，节约四千万元。除以上成绩外，缺点是在原材料供应上，还缺乏计划性，对原料掌握不够，致发生临时乱抓现象。其次是生产效能没有完全发挥，根据最近的调查：帆布是百分之六十六，三斜纹是百分之七十，四斜纹是百分之七十二到百分之八十。这除了生产设备不良外，主要是没能根据技术程度，分配机台，各部配合不够，有忙有闲，以及政治教育不够，一部分工友劳动热情还不够高。现该厂正组织研究小组，作合理的改善。
