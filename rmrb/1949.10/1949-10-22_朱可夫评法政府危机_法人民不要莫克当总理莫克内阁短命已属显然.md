Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 21st: TASS Moscow, 19th: *Pravda* correspondent in Paris, Zhukov, commented on the French government crisis, saying: Moch's failure was expected, if not today, then tomorrow. After the French parliament held a vote on the night of October 13th, and Moch only obtained the power to form a government through obvious deception and manipulation of the voting, it was obvious that the Moch cabinet would not last long. The reactionaries were certainly willing to let him govern, because he is a person with rich police experience. But the whole point is that recent events have convincingly proved that the French people do not want Moch as prime minister, and they are ready to fight him desperately.

Formally speaking, Moch was tripped up by his ally, the Catholic so-called Popular Republican Movement (MRP). Moch intended to give the party two of the most difficult positions—Minister of Finance and Minister of National Economy. Experienced politicians avoid these positions, sarcastically calling them "poisonous gifts." It is not easy to find a financier in the bourgeois parties who is willing to take responsibility for finance and the economy that has been completely devastated by the Marshall Plan.

While the prime ministerial candidate was conducting lengthy and difficult behind-the-scenes negotiations with the shaky parties of his "majority", the movement protesting the "Moch police government" and striving to satisfy the fundamental and legitimate demands of the working people was unfolding widely across the country.

Protest strikes and protest rallies were held everywhere. Despite all the conspiracies of the split trade union organization "Workers' Force," the unity of workers in the struggle to satisfy their demands was strengthened in those days.

After Moch's adventurous failure, President Auriol was forced to continue the difficult work of searching for a prime ministerial candidate. This prime minister, according to *Liberation*, must be authorized by both the White House and the National Assembly. And after being granted power, he must form a government that pursues American policies under the guise of French policies.

Auriol tried to persuade representatives of the Popular Republican Movement—Schuman, Bidault, de Menthon, etc.—to assume government responsibility. They rejected his proposal. Auriol then invited René Mayer of the Radical Party to form a cabinet. Mayer, as Minister of Finance a year and a half ago, devalued the franc and implemented a series of "emergency financial measures" that plundered the working people of the middle class.

　　朱可夫评法政府危机
  　法人民不要莫克当总理莫克内阁短命已属显然
    【新华社北京二十一日电】塔斯社莫斯科十九日讯：真理报驻巴黎记者朱可夫评法国政府的危机称：莫克的失败，原是意料中的事，不是今天，就是明天。在十月十三日夜法国议会举行投票，莫克仅以显然的欺骗和玩弄投票把戏获得了组织政府的权力以后，莫克内阁不能长命已属显然。反动派当然是愿意让他执政的，因为他是一个富有警察经验的人。但是，整个的要点乃是，最近的事件令人信服地证明：法国老百姓不要莫克当总理，他们准备和他拚命。
    形式地说来，莫克是被他的盟友天主教的所谓人民共和运动党绊倒的。莫克打算给该党两个最困难的职位——财政部长和国家经济部长。有经验的政治家躲开这些职位，讥讽地称它们为“有毒的礼物”。在资产阶级政党里找出一个财政家肯担任被马歇尔计划搞得完全崩溃的财政和经济的责任，不是容易的事情。
    当总理的候选人在幕后和他的动摇不稳的“大多数”的党派进行长久而困难的协商时，抗议组织“莫克警察政府”、争取满足劳动人民的根本的合法要求的运动，在全国广泛展开。
    到处举行抗议罢工和抗议集会。尽管从事分裂的职工会组织——“工人力量”的一切阴谋，工人在争取满足其要求的斗争中的团结，在这些日子中是壮大了。
    莫克的冒险失败后，总统阿里奥尔被迫继续寻觅总理候选人的困难工作。这位总理，按照解放报的恰当说法，须经白宫和国民议会双方授权。而在受到权力以后，又须组织一个在法国政策的假面具下奉行美国政策的政府。
    阿里奥尔试图劝服人民共和运动的代表——舒曼、皮杜尔、德门东等来担负政府责任。他们拒绝了他的提议。阿里奥尔随即邀请激进党的勒纳·迈耶出而组阁。迈耶在一年半以前当财政部长时，曾把法郎贬值，并实施了一系列掠夺中等阶级劳动人民的“紧急财政措施”。
