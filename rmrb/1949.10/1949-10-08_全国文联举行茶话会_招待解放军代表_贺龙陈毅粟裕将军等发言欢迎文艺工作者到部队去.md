[This City News] The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles held a tea party at the Six Nations Hotel Restaurant on the 5th to host representatives of the People's Liberation Army attending the People's Political Consultative Conference. Several dozen commanders and political workers of the various field armies attended the invitation, and members of the National Committee of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles participated. The tea party was held in an extremely convivial atmosphere. Generals He Long, Chen Yi, and Su Yu unanimously welcomed literary and art workers to work in the troops in their speeches, and hoped that they would report, express, and fully reflect the rich and moving struggles in the revolutionary war. This would be an education for us and our future generations, and an encouragement to our brothers fighting alongside us all over the world.

The forum was presided over by Chairman Zhou Yang. After explaining the significance of the meeting, Chairman Guo Moruo of the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles delivered a speech, saying: "The Chinese People's Liberation Army is not only a revolutionary armed force, but also a cultural army. The generals present today are not only revolutionary generals, but also cultural generals. Many of our armed comrades are not only charging on the front lines, but also on the cultural front lines. Wherever the army goes, revolutionary culture goes." Finally, he paid tribute to the representatives of the People's Liberation Army on behalf of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and hoped that they would offer more suggestions on literary and artistic work.

General He Long spoke first, recounting the great contributions made by literary and art workers in the Northwest Liberated Area and the First Field Army during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation. Finally, he said: "The northwest border is a relatively backward area. I hope that a large number of literary and art workers will go to cultivate this vast land, just as the Soviet Union opened up Siberia after the victory of the revolution."

General Chen Yi pointed out the role of revolutionary intellectuals in the People's Liberation Army. He said: "From the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army to today's People's Liberation Army, in every period, a large number of young intellectuals have continuously poured into the revolutionary troops. The combination of intellectuals and workers and peasants has played a significant role in improving the combat effectiveness, cultural standards, and political awareness of the troops."

General Su Yu said: "The cultural workers of the troops are also combatants. In actual struggles, a large number of cultural cadres are cultivated and trained. In the troops, cultural cadres, political cadres, and military cadres are consistent. It is precisely because the People's Liberation Army is an army that closely combines military science and cultural science that it is victorious in every battle." Finally, he said: "Today, our troops must be further improved and move towards regularization and modernization. Of course, we will need more intellectuals to come to the troops."

He Changgong, Zhou Huan, and General Liao Yunzhou, who revolted in the Huaihai Campaign, also spoke successively. General Liao Yunzhou also specifically mentioned the great influence and encouragement of the performances of "The White Haired Girl" and "Blood and Tears" and the work of literary and art workers on the front lines on the troops after the uprising.

A dinner was held after the meeting. They toasted each other, fully expressing their consistent enthusiasm, joy, and harmonious emotions.

　　全国文联举行茶话会
    招待解放军代表
    贺龙陈毅粟裕将军等发言欢迎文艺工作者到部队去
    【本市讯】中华全国文联五日上午假六国饭店餐厅举行茶话会，招待参加人民政协的人民解放军代表。应约赴会的有各野战军指挥员及政工人员代表数十人，文联全国委员会委员均参加。茶话会在极欢洽的空气中进行。贺龙、陈毅、粟裕三将军在讲话中一致欢迎文艺工作者到部队去工作，并希望他们把革命战争中丰富的可歌可泣的斗争，报道出来，表现出来，充分地反映出来，对我们，对我们的后一代都是一个教育，对全世界并肩作战的兄弟也是一个鼓励。
    座谈会由周扬主席，说明开会意义后，继由全国文联主席郭沫若致词，他说：中国人民解放军不但是革命的武装，而且是文化的军队，今天在座的诸位将军们，不但是革命的将军，而且是文化的将军，我们的许多武装同志，不但在前线上打冲锋，而且在文化战线上也打冲锋，军队到了那里，革命的文化就到了那里。最后他代表文联向人民解放军代表致敬，并希望他们对文艺工作多提意见。
    贺龙将军首先发言，他叙述了西北解放区和一野的文艺工作者在抗日战争中，在解放战争中所做的伟大贡献。最后他说：西北边疆是比较落后的地区，希望大批的文艺工作者象苏联在革命胜利后开辟西伯利亚那样的去开垦这块广大的土地。
    陈毅将军指出人民解放军中革命知识分子成份的作用，他说：从工农红军发展到今天的人民解放军，在每个时期中，青年知识分子大量地不断地涌进革命的部队中来，知识分子与工农分子的结合，对于部队战斗力，文化水准，政治觉悟的提高，起了重大的作用。
    粟裕将军说：部队文化工作者，同时也是战斗员，在实际斗争中，培养出锻炼出大批的文化干部，在部队中，文化干部、政治干部、军事干部，是一致的。正因为人民解放军是军事科学与文化科学的密切结合的部队，它才是百战百胜的。最后他说：今天我们的部队要更进一步的提高，要走向正规化，现代化，当然，我们会需要更多的知识分子到部部队中来的。
    何长工、周桓和在淮海役战中起义的廖运周将军也都相继讲话。廖运周将军并特别提出了部队起义后，“白毛女”、“血泪仇”的演出、和文艺工作者在火线上工作对部队所起的伟大的影响与鼓励作用。
    会后聚餐。相互举杯敬酒，充分地表现了一致的热烈，愉快，和谐的情绪。
