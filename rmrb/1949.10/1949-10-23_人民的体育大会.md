　　People's Sports Meet
　　Lin Wei
　　In the capital of the Chinese people, everything is advancing rapidly in the direction of serving the people. In terms of sports work, people also strongly felt this epoch-making transformation and progress from the Beijing People's Sports Meet, which opened on October 22nd at the Temple of Agriculture. In this conference, there were none of the despicable infighting of sports associations during the Kuomintang rule, nor the phenomenon of disunity caused by vying for championships. Although everyone was also actively striving for victory, this was being carried out under a common, lofty, and far-reaching goal. This goal is mentioned in the "Conference Slogan": "Strengthen our bodies, defend our great motherland!" "Cultivate strong physiques, and welcome the great high tide of economic construction and the high tide of cultural construction!"
　　The construction of New China requires millions of people to have strong physiques and a spirit of unity and struggle, so most of the participating units created programs that could absorb large numbers of people to participate in performances. The first program of the conference – elementary school group exercises – had two thousand and several hundred participants. The two "Five-Star Races" for the boys' elementary school group and the girls' elementary school group had a thousand children participating. These one thousand children formed ten large five-pointed stars, with twenty people at each corner of each five-pointed star. With each corner as a small unit, each child ran around the five-pointed star for one lap, and then passed the small flag to the next child to continue running. Whichever corner finished running first would seize the big red flag. In this way, a thousand people all ran one lap in a few minutes of competition. If not every participant was strong, the big red flag could not be seized. Other things like building human pyramids, forming Chinese characters, big dances, military bayonet drill performances, etc.... all required everyone to be good in order to win. Here, the victory flag promoted the participation of the majority of people in sports activities.
　　This kind of large group program accounted for a large proportion this time, which is a reversal compared to the Kuomintang era. People from the sports circles of various provinces and cities who came to visit especially praised this transformation. And what is even more worthy of promotion is that more than twenty schools jointly created and jointly performed a program (such as the primary school of the eleventh district), which made them more closely united through sports connections, instead of attacking each other as in the old days.
　　A representative from Shanghai told me that he paid special attention to a change at this conference, which was that tickets were not sold, and ticket prices were not raised even if the program was wonderful. This formed a sharp contrast with the sports associations run by the Kuomintang. He said that at that time, they regarded this as a way to make money. Therefore, the order of the venue was also very chaotic. But now it is in good order. Everyone who knows history will feel this change.
　　Another feature of the conference is the infinite excitement and joy of the people participating in the conference, just like during the carnival period in early October. The "Liberation Flowers Bloom Everywhere" performed by the First Affiliated Elementary School of Normal University used the movements of hundreds of people to form various beautiful flowers to express their joy. There were many other units with similar natures and many variations. In addition, more units used five-pointed stars or sickles and axes as their formations or performance patterns. When the performance team from China University entered the podium, they shouted loudly: "Old China is dead! New China is born! The Chinese people stand up! Let us sing to our heart's content!" The deafening sound of gongs and drums poured out, and they danced a vigorous flower drum dance. The performance team of the Women's Affiliated Middle School of Normal University, each holding two red flags in their hands, used their bright colors to weave their favorite words such as "Chairman Mao". The children of the Fourth District Joint Elementary School wore various clothes of workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and merchants, and jointly danced, indicating that people of all classes should unite and build their own prosperous and strong country.
　　New China is born, and the national, scientific, and mass sports that meet the needs of the people are also beginning to be born. It will inevitably be promoted to all parts of the country at a very fast speed, adding infinite strength to the people's motherland's national defense and production construction.

　　人民的体育大会
    林韦
    在中国人民的首都，一切都正向着服务人民的方向疾进。在体育工作方面，人们从十月二十二日在先农坛揭幕的北京市人民体育大会上，同样强烈地感觉到这种划时代的转变与进展。在这个大会上，没有国民党统治时代体育会中那些可鄙的明争暗斗，为争夺锦标而闹不团结的现象，虽然大家也在十分积极地争取优胜，但这是在一个共同的崇高远大的目标下进行着，这目标就是“大会口号”中所提的：“锻炼体格，捍卫我们伟大的祖国！”“培养坚强的体格，迎接伟大的经济建设高潮和文化建设高潮！”
    新中国的建设要求千千万万的人民都有健强的体格与团结奋斗的精神，所以大多数参加竞赛的单位都创造了能吸收广大人群参加表演的节目。大会的第一个节目——小学团体操，有两千几百人参加。男子小学组与女子小学组的两场“五星赛跑”，参加的有一千个孩子。这一千孩子摆成十个大五星，每个五星的一角都有二十个人。以每一角为一个小单位，每个孩子围着五星跑一周，然后将小旗递与下一孩子接着跑。哪一角先跑完，便去夺大红旗。这样，一千个人都在几分钟的竞赛里跑了一圈。如果不是参加者每一个人都健壮，大红旗是夺不到的。其他如叠罗汉，组字，大舞蹈，部队的刺杀表演，……都是必须每一个人都好才能获胜的。这里，优胜旗就推动了多数人参加体育活动。
    这种大团体的节目，这次占了很大的比重，和国民党时代相比，正是一个颠倒。各省市体育界前来参观的人都特别称道这个改造。而更值得发扬的，是二十多个学校联合创作与联合表演一个节目（如十一区小学），这使他们经过体育上的联系，更加亲密团结起来，而不是象旧时代的互相攻讦。
    一个上海的代表告诉我，他在这个大会上特别注意到一个变化，就是不卖门票，更不因为节目精彩而提高票价，这与国民党办的体育会形成尖锐的对比。他说，那时候他们是把这当成进财之道的。所以会场秩序也非常混乱。而现在则井井有条。这种变化，每个知道历史的人都会感觉到的。
    大会的另一特色，是参加大会的人群的无限振奋与愉快，就象十月初的狂欢时期一样。师大第一附小表演的“解放花到处开”，是用数百人的动作组成各色各样好看的花朵来表现其欢欣的。同类性质而有不少变化的，还有好些单位。另外更多的单位，是以五角星或镰刀斧头做为自己的队形或表演图案。华大的表演队伍进入主席台前时，高声喊道：“旧中国灭亡了！新中国诞生了！中国人民站立起来了！让我们尽情的歌唱吧！”喧天的锣鼓声倾泻而出，他们跳起了矫健花鼓舞。师大女附中的表演队，每人手里都拿着两面红旗，用它们鲜明的色泽织成她们心爱的字样如“毛主席”等。四区联合小学的孩子们则穿了工农兵学商的各种衣服，联合舞蹈，表示各阶层人民应该团结一致，建设自己繁荣富强的国家。
    新中国诞生了，适应人民需要的民族的、科学的、大众的体育也在开始诞生。它必将以特快的速度推广到全国各地，给人民祖国的国防与生产建设事业增加无穷的力量。
