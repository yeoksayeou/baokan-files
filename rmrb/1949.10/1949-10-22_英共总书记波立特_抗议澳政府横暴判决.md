Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 21st: TASS, London Dispatch: British Communist Party General Secretary Pollitt, on behalf of the British Communist Party Executive Committee, sent a letter to the Australian High Commissioner in London on the 17th, strongly protesting the conviction and sentencing of Australian Communist Party General Secretary Sharkey. The letter stated: "This conviction and brutal sentence is a blatant attack on freedom of speech and a part of the reactionary offensive launched by the Australian government against the Australian working class and its struggle for peace and social progress. The Australian government initiated the accusation against Sharkey because Sharkey is the outstanding leader of the Australian Communist Party, which leads Australia's growing movement for peace and friendship with the Soviet Union. Sharkey's real 'crime' is his consistent insistence on carrying out the struggle against the policies of the Australian government and its supporters, who are making Australia follow the American warmongers, thereby threatening the Australian people with the terror of an anti-Soviet war. He stands at the forefront of the struggle against the government and employers' attacks on workers' living conditions, thus incurring the hatred of those who protect profits and privileges. This is a politically persecutory trial, the purpose of the verdict is to intimidate all those who oppose the current disastrous policies of the Australian government. All people who love peace and freedom in Britain and the world will protest this action. We demand that the Australian government immediately revoke the conviction and sentence, and we firmly believe that the British working-class movement will support this demand." Pollitt has also telegraphed Australian Prime Minister Chifley demanding that the conviction and sentence be revoked.

　　英共总书记波立特
  　抗议澳政府横暴判决
    【新华社北京二十一日电】塔斯社伦敦讯：英国共产党总书记波立特于十七日代表英共执委会致函澳大利亚驻伦敦高级专员，强力抗议对澳共总书记夏基的定罪以及对他的判决。该函称：“这一定罪以及横暴的判决，乃是对言论自由的彰明昭著的攻击，是澳大利亚政府对澳大利亚工人阶级及其争取和平与社会进步的斗争所进行的反动攻势的一部分。澳大利亚政府所以发动对夏基的控诉，是因为夏基是澳大利亚共产党的卓越领袖，这个政党领导着澳大利亚的日益壮大的争取和平与对苏联友好的运动。夏基真正的‘罪名’就是他一贯地坚持进行反对澳大利亚政府及其支持者的政策的斗争。这些人正使澳大利亚追随着美国战争贩子，从而以反苏战争的恐怖威胁着澳大利亚人民。他站在反对政府及雇主进攻工人生活条件的斗争的最前列，由此招致了利润与特权保护者的仇恨。这是一个政治迫害性的审判，其判决的目的在于恫吓一切反对澳政府现行灾难性政策的人们。英国及全世界的一切爱好和平与自由的人们，均将抗议这一行动。我们要求澳大利亚政府立即取消定罪和判决，我们深信英国的工人阶级运动将支持这一要求。”波立特并已致电澳总理齐佛莱要求取消定罪和判决。
