　　The democratic appraisal of People's Grants-in-Aid movement at the Girls’ No. 2 Middle School in Beijing provides many successful experiences for the ongoing work of appraising People's Grants-in-Aid in various schools in Beijing.

　　The school’s People's Grants-in-Aid appraisal work began on September 20th and ended on September 26th. During the appraisal, the spirit of self-reporting, public discussion, and democratic discussion was fully promoted. In addition to the participation of all students, all faculty and staff members of the school were mobilized. All teachers in the school formed eight guidance groups, each responsible for guiding two classes (a total of sixteen classes in the school), with the grade director (most of whom participated in the grant-in-aid appraisal work last semester) serving as the group leader.

　　In the process of preparing for mobilization and organizational work, a meeting of all teachers and some staff members of the Academic Affairs Office was convened. Guan Moran, Director of Academic Affairs, clarified the significance of People's Grants-in-Aid at the meeting and pointed out that this democratic appraisal movement must achieve the following four goals: 1. Ensure that truly poor students can get help. 2. Combine with the disaster relief movement to educate students on subordinating individual interests to overall interests, and improve students' thinking. 3. Teachers can gain a deeper understanding of students' economic and ideological situations, which will facilitate the promotion of teaching work in the future. 4. Through this movement, teachers can learn democratic management methods under the new democratic education. He emphasized that teachers should stand in a guiding position and prevent the phenomenon of doing things for others instead of helping them.

　　The school's Communist Youth League branch also mobilized all Youth League members to play a leading and exemplary role. It called on League members to learn from Yang Xiulan (who automatically withdrew from the grant-in-aid last semester due to family poverty, but still received the grant-in-aid after being approved by the class review committee and the school review committee), Zhang Chaoran, Liu qi＠①, Pan Huan, etc., and actively assist the school to better complete this task of appraising grants-in-aid.

　　Before the review work began, in addition to ideological mobilization and deliberation in each class, a general student mobilization meeting was held. At the meeting, Director Guan Moran explained in detail the significance of People's Grants-in-Aid and explained the attitudes that students applying for grants-in-aid and students not applying for grants-in-aid should hold. He also patiently persuaded and explained certain ideological biases among students, such as the request for all to enjoy grants-in-aid, and the idea that students in workers' children classes should not only be exempt from tuition and miscellaneous fees, but also enjoy grants-in-aid.

　　The review work was first conducted by the class review committees of each class. Because the students had conducted home visits in advance, they had a considerable understanding of the family economic situation of the applicants. First, the applicants reported on their family economic situation, and then everyone discussed it. Everyone's attitude was serious and conscientious during the discussion. After review by each class, seven people who originally received grants-in-aid did not continue to apply this time. For example, Li Ruolan from Junior Three (A), who originally received a first-class (70 jin) grant-in-aid, did not apply this time. She said: "During the summer vacation, I taught in the countryside for a few days. The crops there were flooded, and the farmers only ate wild vegetables and thin cornmeal porridge every day, and their lives were extremely hard. Now my aunt weaves nets for people, and my mother works as a servant, which can give me a total of 20 jin of millet per month. If I paste some matchboxes myself, I can make a living, so I won't apply." At the class review meeting, the students who applied to withdraw from the grant-in-aid were also carefully discussed to avoid the bias of students who needed help giving up the grant-in-aid due to a temporary emotional impulse.

　　After the class review committee decided on the list of students who needed to receive grants-in-aid and their grades, it was submitted to the school review committee composed of the principal, the director of academic affairs, the director of general affairs, the leaders of each guidance group, and the representatives of each class (a total of 30 people) for review, and the list was finally announced.

　　After this democratic appraisal movement, the teachers and students were universally and deeply educated. The teachers unanimously believed that they had understood the importance of following the mass line from this movement. Geography teacher Zhu Shuxian said: In the past, the so-called disaster relief funds handled by the Kuomintang reactionaries mostly adopted egalitarianism, and everyone who applied got a share, so that some students ate, drank, and played after receiving the money, and the poor students still had no way out. Now we are following the mass line and adopting democratic appraisal methods, so that poor students have received help, and the blood and sweat of the peasants have not been wasted. This is a great success.

　　The students took a big lesson in democracy in this movement, educating and learning from each other, consciously being responsible to the students and the people, and cultivating good habits of selflessness. At the same time, it further promoted mutual understanding among students, and unity and cooperation between teachers and students, and improved students' thinking. Because of the short time and insufficient in-depth understanding of the situation in this movement, there are still shortcomings. For example, it is difficult to determine whether there is a clear line between students who have obtained a third-class grant-in-aid (35 jin of millet) and some students whose family economic situation is more difficult but have not applied for a grant-in-aid, so deviations are inevitable. In addition, the Education Bureau did not have enough contact with various districts when arranging the work, so the police stations failed to truthfully and objectively introduce the specific situation of the students' families to the school for reference when writing certificates, which also increased the difficulty of the school's handling. Some refused to provide certificates for students from landlord and bureaucrat families, even though they knew that their families were indeed poor now. These need to be resolved in the future by closely contacting the masses, deeply understanding the situation, and conducting ideological education.

　　女二中民主评议人民助学金经过
    有琼
    北京市立女二中的民主评议人民助学金运动，为正在进行中的京市各校评议人民助学金工作，提供了许多的成功的经验。
    该校的人民助学金评议工作，自九月二十日开始，至二十六日结束，在评议中，充分地发扬了自报公议民主讨论的精神。评议工作除全校同学参加外，并动员了全校的教职员参加，全校教员共组成八个辅导小组，每组负责辅导两班（全校共十六班）。由级主任（大多数参加过上学期的助学金评议工作）担任组长。
    在准备动员和组织工作的过程中，又召开了全体教员和教导处一部分职员大会，教导主任关沫然在会上阐明人民助学金的意义；并指出这次的民主评议运动一定要达到下列四个目的：一、使真正贫苦的同学能得到帮助。二、结合救灾运动，进行个人利益服从整体利益的教育，使学生在思想上提高一步。三、教员能更深入地了解同学经济情况和思想情况，便于今后推动教学工作。四、通过这一运动，使教员学会新民主主义教育下的民主管理方法。他强调指出：教员应站在辅导的地位，防止句办代替的现象。
    该校青年团支部亦动员全体青年团员，起带头和模范作用。并号召团员向上学期自动退出助学金的杨秀兰（因家庭贫苦，又经班审会和校审会通过仍领助学金）、张超然、刘ｑī＠①、潘缓等学习。积极协助学校，更好的完成这次评议助学金的任务。
    审查工作开始前，除各班的思想动员与酝酿外，又召开了全体学生动员大会。会上，关沫然主任详细地解释了人民助学金的意义，和说明请求助学金的同学与不请求助学金的同学应持的态度；并对同学中某些思想偏向如要求全体享受助学金、工人子弟班同学不但要免学杂费，同时还要全体享有助学金等思想，作了耐心的说服解释。
    审查工作是先由各班分别召开班审查委员会进行的。因同学们事先曾作过家庭访问，故对申请同学的家庭经济状况都有相当的了解。先由申请者报告家庭经济情况，再由同学们大家讨论。讨论时大家的态度都很严肃认真。经过各班审查后，原来领有助学金，这次不继续申请的有七人，例如初三甲李若兰，原领甲等（七十斤）助学金，这次就没有申请。她说：“暑期里我在乡间教了几天书，这里庄稼被水淹了，农民每天只吃野菜和棒子面的稀粥，生活苦极了。现在我姑姑给人织网，母亲给人当用人，每月一共可以给我二十斤小米，我自己再糊点洋火盒，就能够过活，我不申请了。”班审会上，对于申请退出助学金的同学，也都经过慎重的讨论，以免发生需要帮助的同学因了一时感情冲动便放弃助学金的偏向。
    班审会决定了需要领取助学金的名单和等级后，再交给由校长、教导主任、总务主任、各辅导小组组长和各班代表等三十人组成的校审查委员会上审查，最后公布名单。
    经过这次民主评议运动后，普遍深入地教育了教员和同学。教员们一致认为从这次运动中了解了走群众路线的重要性。地理教员朱淑先说：过去，国民党反动派办的所谓难区救济金，多半采取大平均主义，凡申请的都有份，以致部分同学领到钱后大吃大玩，贫苦的同学仍然没有办法。现在我们走群众路线，采取民主评议的方法，使贫苦的同学得到了帮助，也没有浪费农民的血汗，这是极大的成功。
    同学们在这个运动里上了民主的大课，互相教育，互相学习，自觉地对同学负责，对人民负责，培养了大公无私的好习惯。同时更促进了同学之间的互相了解，和师生之间的团结和合作，使同学们在思想上提高了一步。这次运动中因时间短，深入了解情况还不够，所以仍有缺点存在，譬如获得丙等助学金（三十五斤小米）的同学和一部分家庭经济情况较困难而未申请助学金的同学之间，究竟有没有显明的界线，很难确定，因此也就难免有偏差。又如教育局在布置工作时，和各区的联系不够，以致派出所在写证明时，未能把学生家庭的具体情况真实客观的介绍给学校作参考，也增加学校处理上的困难。有的则对于地主官僚家庭出身的学生，虽明知其家庭现在确实贫困，也不予以证明。这些，都需要今后从密切联系群众，深入了解情况，和进行思想教育中去获得解决。
