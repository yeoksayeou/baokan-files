　　New Book Loved by Children:
　　"China Children" Issue 2 Published
　　Wang Zhi
　　These days, many children are going in and out of the distribution department of China Youth Publishing House at No. 2 Wangfujing Street, many accompanied by their parents. When they come out, they all have a copy of the second issue of "China Children" in their hands, smiling and flipping through it as they walk.
　　Look! The bright red cover celebrates the birth of the People's Republic of China. How happy those children are, carrying flags and lanterns. The young reporter, Full Sky Fly, told the children about the lively scenes of the celebration after returning from participating in the founding ceremony. Comrade Jiang Nanxiang told everyone that it was because of the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party and the hard work of the people that the People's Republic of China was founded today. Therefore, everyone must "cherish our motherland and cherish our Chairman Mao." Shang Shixin, Guo Ruoyuan, and Cai Xiang, these three children love Chairman Mao. Look at them "performing the Yangko dance for Chairman Mao." They hope that "the 27th will come quickly!" So they can see Chairman Mao and present him with flowers.
　　This book also has a new classroom where children are racking their brains doing compositions. Someone tells them, "Write about things you are familiar with." Sure enough, everyone wrote: Guo Chong wrote "Bringing a Basket of Pears to Brother," Li Xiu wrote "The Fruits of Production," and Xie Liangwen wrote "My First Visit to the Factory." They all wrote about their own experiences and wrote very well. In the new classroom, Mr. Gao Shiqi continues to finish "Unveiling the Secrets of Lilliput," explaining many scientific principles. Fan Dizhi tells a story about a clever child who figured out "How Many Pears Did Mom Buy?" Everyone can also calculate it themselves. A Soviet friend also recited a story poem called "Two Comrades," which tells children to help others more, and that's what makes a good child.
　　Ah! There are so many stories and pictures in this book! There's Liu Yiyan's "Little Sizi's Good Idea," Xiao Yemu's "The Story of the Sheepdog," Zuo Lin's "Forty-Five Thousand Mile Journey," and many games. No wonder many children are rushing to buy this book.

　　小朋友们爱看的新书　
   “中国儿童”第二期出版
    王志
    这几天，王府井大街二号中国青年社发行部门口，小朋友们出出进进，有很多是爸爸妈妈带着去的，他们出来时手里都拿着一本第二期的“中国儿童”，笑嘻嘻地一面翻一面走。
    看！大红的封面，是庆祝中华人民共和国诞生的，那些小朋友们打着旗，提着灯多高兴。小记者满天飞这次参加开国大典回来和小朋友们讲了庆祝大会热闹的情形；蒋南翔同志告诉大家说：这是因为毛主席和共产党正确的领导，全国人民的坚苦奋斗，才有今天的中华人民共和国成立，所以大家一定要好好的“爱护我们的祖国，爱护我们的毛主席”。尚世馨、郭若橼、蔡湘三位小朋友就是热爱毛主席的，你看他们“给毛主席扭秧歌”，他们希望“二十七日快点来吧”。好去看毛主席，给毛主席献花。
    这本书还有一个新课堂，小朋友们在课堂里做作文正在伤脑筋，有人告诉他们说：“写自己熟悉的事情。”果然，大家都写出来了：郭充写“给哥哥捎上一筐梨”，李岫写“生产的果实”，谢良文写“我第一次参观工厂”，都是写自己经过的事情，写得都很好。新课堂里高士其先生又继续讲完了“揭穿了小人国的秘密”，讲了很多科学道理；范迪之讲一个聪敏的小朋友，怎样算出了“妈妈买了多少梨？”大家还可自己算一算。还有苏联的朋友念了首“两个同志”的故事诗，故事里告诉小朋友要多多帮助别人，才是好孩子。
    啊呀！这本书里故事啊！画啊！还多得很，有刘益晏画的“小四子的好计策”，萧也牧的“放羊狗的故事”，左林的“四万五千里旅行记”，还有很多游戏，难怪很多小朋友们要抢着买这本书了。
