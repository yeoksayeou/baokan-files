Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 12th -- In commemorating the Xinhai Revolution on October 10th, overseas Chinese in various locations mostly hung the new national flag, the Five-Star Red Flag, and refused to hang the Kuomintang government's Blue Sky with a White Sun flag, expressing their love for the new motherland and their contempt for the remnant Kuomintang reactionaries. In San Francisco, 400 members of the Chinese Workers Mutual Aid Association held a rally in Chinatown on the evening of the 9th to celebrate the victory of the motherland. The national flag of the People's Republic of China—the Five-Star Red Flag—was hung at the meeting. While the meeting was in progress, Kuomintang secret agents, condoned by American officials, broke into the venue, seized the microphone from the speaker, and created disturbances.

In Batavia, overseas Chinese expressed extreme indignation at the Dutch authorities' ban on hanging the national flag of the People's Republic of China. Chinese actors there stated that if the theater still hung the flag of the Kuomintang era, they would go on strike. In Yogyakarta, overseas Chinese were unwilling to listen to the demands of Kuomintang-controlled groups and refused to hang the old national flag.

In Yangon, Burmese Chinese had prepared to hold a mass rally and hang the national flag of the People's Republic of China, but this was thwarted by the actions of the Burmese authorities. The committee issued a statement condemning the Kuomintang reactionary group and stating that Burmese Chinese support the People's Republic of China.

In Bangkok, the Thai authorities unreasonably confiscated the national flags of the People's Republic of China that overseas Chinese had prepared to hang, and arbitrarily arrested many overseas Chinese, including the editor and assistant editor of the Chinese-run "Quanmin Bao" (People's News). Because they were forbidden to hang the national flag of their motherland, the Five-Star Red Flag, overseas Chinese generally preferred not to hang any flag.

　　五星红旗飘扬海外各地  旅外侨胞热爱新生祖国
    【新华社北京十二日电】海外各地侨胞在十月十日纪念辛亥革命节时，大多数都悬挂五星红旗的新国旗，而拒绝悬挂国民党政府的青天白日满地红旗帜，表示了对新生祖国的热爱和对残余国民党反动集团的唾弃。在旧金山，华侨工人互助协会四百名会员于九日晚在唐人街举行了庆祝祖国胜利的集会，会上挂着中华人民共和国的国旗——五星红旗。当会议进行时，美国官方放纵的国民党特务分子曾闯入会场，从演讲者手中，夺去扩音器，进行捣乱。
    在巴达维亚，由于荷兰官方禁止华侨悬挂中华人民共和国的国旗，侨胞们极表愤慨。该地华侨演员表示，如果戏院仍挂国民党时代的旗帜，那么他们就将罢演。在日惹，侨胞都不愿意听从国民党御用团体的要求，拒绝悬挂旧国旗。
    在仰光，缅甸华侨曾准备举行群众大会和悬挂中华人民共和国国旗，但由于缅甸官方的作梗而不果。该委员会发表声明，谴责国民党反动集团，并表示缅甸华侨拥护中华人民共和国。
    在曼谷，泰国当局无理地没收了侨胞准备悬挂的中华人民共和国国旗，并蛮横地逮捕了许多侨胞，包括华侨办的“全民报”编辑和助理编辑。由于被禁止悬挂祖国五星红旗的国旗，侨胞们普遍地宁愿不挂任何旗帜。
