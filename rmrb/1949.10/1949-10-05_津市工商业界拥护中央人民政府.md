　　Tianjin Industrial and Commercial Circles
    Endorse the Central People's Government
    [Special Dispatch from Our Correspondent in Tianjin, 2nd] The industrial and commercial circles of Tianjin warmly endorse the Common Program adopted by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the formal establishment of the Central People's Government, as well as the inauguration of Chairman Mao and others, and express their determination to take active steps to further advance the industrial and commercial construction of Tianjin. Workers from various factories have proposed to shoulder the responsibility of the leading class, adopt a new attitude toward labor, and increase production to greet the birth of New China. Si Nansheng, Deputy Manager of Qixin Cement Company, Zhao Yuanfang, Manager of Zhongnan Bank, and Wang Zhizhou, Manager of Hengtong Trading Company, and other members of the industrial and commercial sectors, believe that the Common Program clearly defines the development path for public and private industrial and commercial enterprises, and private entrepreneurs will be bolder in their efforts to operate and undertake the glorious task of building the new Tianjin. Liu Chijun, Chief Engineer of the China Textile Company, said: The Common Program stipulates that future industrial construction should focus on heavy industry, which is the necessary path for a backward agricultural country to advance to an advanced industrial country. The Tianjin Import and Export Trade Business Association stated: This association bears the responsibility of internal and external exchange and communication between urban and rural trade, and will strive to undertake this glorious task in the future.

　　津市工商业界
    拥护中央人民政府
    【本报记者天津二日专电】津市工商业界对于人民政协通过的共同纲领及中央人民政府正式成立，毛主席等宣告就职，一致热烈拥护，表示决以积极行动把天津的工商业建设向前推进一步。各厂工人提出，要担负领导阶级的责任，以新的劳动态度，提高生产，迎接新中国的诞生。工商业界启新洋灰公司副理姒南笙、中南银行经理赵元方、亨通贸易公司经理王芷洲等，认为共同纲领中对于公私营工商业发展的路线规定得很明确，私人企业家更会大胆地努力经营，负起新天津建设的光荣任务。中纺公司总工程师刘持钧说：共同纲领内规定今后的工业建设以重工业为重心，是由落后的农业国迈进先进工业国的必经途径。津市进出口贸易商业同业公会表示：本会负有内外交流及沟通城乡贸易的责任，今后当努力负担起这一光荣任务。
