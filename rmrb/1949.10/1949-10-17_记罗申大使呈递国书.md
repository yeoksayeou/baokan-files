　　Record of Ambassador Roshchin Presenting His Credentials
    Xu Cheng
    Ambassador Roshchin, wearing a brand-new dark blue diplomatic uniform, with the dazzling medals and commemorative badges covering his left chest, shone with a golden light under the mercury lamps. With fervent and touched emotion, he presented the credentials of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, brought from Moscow, to Chairman Mao with both hands. Chairman Mao personally received them and handed them to Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhou Enlai, standing on his right. The time was exactly 5:00 PM on October 16, 1949.
    This is a moment worth remembering. It lets the peace-loving people of the world know that the close and firm friendship between the powerful Soviet Union and our country provides a more reliable guarantee for lasting world peace; this moment lets the foolish enemies at home and abroad know that besides continuing to use boring shouts and quarrels to express their fear and despair, they will never have any other way.
    At this moment, the Chinese people are infinitely grateful to the great friendly country—the Soviet Union—for giving us sublime friendship. When Chairman Mao held the Soviet credentials in his hands, and when Chairman Mao shook hands tightly with Ambassador Roshchin, the counselor, secretary, and military attaché of the Soviet Embassy shook hands with Chairman Mao one by one. As Chairman Mao smiled and cordially asked each of them their identity and name, the various lights in the magnificent hall illuminated Chairman Mao's face, filled with infinite joy. I saw the joyous smiles of the Chinese people's victory. Ambassador Roshchin conveyed the wishes of the Soviet people directly to the Chinese people today, and his happiness represented the joy of the Soviet people.
    After the ceremony, during the toast, Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhou Enlai and the friends from the Soviet Embassy repeatedly and heartily toasted. He said: "I wish the people of the two countries, the heads of the two countries, good health!" People stood up to toast him for his sincere congratulations. Once again, when Foreign Minister Zhou said, "I wish Vyshinsky good health! I wish Gromyko good health!" there was another burst of clinking glasses, and the joy was extraordinary. Ambassador Roshchin specifically found General Nie Rongzhen, acting Chief of Staff of the People's Liberation Army, to toast, and said: "Celebrate the liberation of Guangzhou!" "Celebrate the great victory of the Chinese People's Liberation Army!" Everyone cheered. The victory of the Chinese people's struggle and the cause of defending world peace are so closely linked together.

　　记罗申大使呈递国书
    许  诚
    罗申大使穿着一身藏青色的崭新的外交礼服，挂满在他的左胸前的灿烂耀目的勋章、纪念章，在水银灯下闪发着金色的光彩，他以热烈的感动的心情，双手将莫斯科带来的苏维埃社会主义共和国联邦的国书呈递在毛主席的面前，毛主席亲手接过来交给站在右边的外交部周恩来部长。这时间是一九四九年十月十六日下午五点正。
    这是一个值得人们记忆的时刻。它让全世界爱好和平的人民知道，强大的苏联和我国之间亲密稳固的友谊，使世界的持久和平有了更可靠的保障；这个时刻让国内外愚蠢的敌人知道，他们除了继续用无聊的叫嚣和争吵来表示他们的恐惧和绝望以外，别的，他们是再也不会有什么办法了。
    在这一个时刻中，中国的人民无限感谢伟大的友邦——苏联给予我们崇高的友谊。当毛主席手中拿着苏联国书的时候，当毛主席和罗申大使紧紧握手之后，苏联大使馆的参赞，秘书、武官一一与毛主席握手，毛主席微笑着亲切地问着他们每一个人的身份、姓名的时候，金碧辉煌的会场上的各种灯光，照映着洋溢无限喜悦的毛主席的面孔，我看到了中国人民胜利的欢笑。罗申大使今天带着苏联人民的意愿直接传达于中国人民之前，他的高兴代表着苏联人民的快乐。
    在仪式完毕，进酒点的时候，外交部周恩来部长和苏联大使馆的朋友们几次尽情地干杯。他说：“祝两国人民，两国元首健康！”人们都站起来为他衷心的庆贺而干杯。在又一次，周外长说到“祝维辛斯基健康！祝葛罗米柯健康！”的时候，又是一阵碰杯的声音，欢洽非凡。罗申大使专门找到了人民解放军代参谋总长聂荣臻将军碰杯，他说：“庆祝广州解放！”“庆祝中国人民解放军大胜利！”大家都欢呼起来。中国人民斗争的胜利，和保卫世界持久和平的事业是这样紧紧地结在一起。
