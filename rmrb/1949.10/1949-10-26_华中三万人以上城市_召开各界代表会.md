Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, October 24th. Cities in Central China with populations over 30,000 are successively convening People's Representative Conferences from all walks of life. Changsha and Changde in Hunan, Nanchang and Jiujiang in Jiangxi, Xiangfan, Laohekou, Yichang, and Yunyang (under the jurisdiction of the Southern Shaanxi Administrative Office) in Hubei, and Zhengzhou, Shangqiu, Kaifeng, and Luoyang in Henan have all been convened. Echeng and Xindi in Hubei are also preparing to convene. In the People's Representative Conferences from all walks of life in various places, the local People's Governments made work reports to the representatives, reviewed past work, and discussed future work guidelines and tasks. Through these meetings, the connection between the People's Government and the masses has become closer, and the enthusiasm and creativity of people from all walks of life in participating in production and construction have greatly improved. Many constructive opinions have been put forward for future work, and criticisms have been made of phenomena that hinder the development of production. For example, the Xiangfan People's Representative Conference criticized the erroneous behavior of individual capitalists who threatened workers with closures when discussing labor-capital issues, and also reviewed the workers' excessive demands on wage issues, thus clearly recognizing that only by correctly implementing the policy of benefiting both labor and capital can production be developed. For example, Yunyang City is located in a remote area, and the first thing to solve in order to restore production is the problem of exporting local products. Therefore, it focused on discussing and solving the problems of developing public-private trade, developing shipping, and organizing the export of local products. Changde, Hunan, was liberated not long ago, and the people from all walks of life were most concerned about social security issues. The representatives at the meeting requested the rapid establishment of revolutionary order, the elimination of bandits and special agent remnants, and put forward many valuable opinions and specific methods on issues such as military-civilian cooperation in suppressing bandits and fire and air defense. These meetings prove that the People's Representative Conferences from all walks of life not only help the restoration and development of production in cities that have been liberated for a long time, but also play a great role in helping the people in newly liberated cities assist in military control work. Various localities have also solved many specific problems according to their actual conditions. For example, the Laohekou People's Representatives decided that the government should uniformly stipulate the weights and measures used by shops, and that the demolition and sale of houses on the streets should not be allowed, which are the most urgent demands of the local people's lives. Xiangfan established four committees, including a tax assessment committee, a committee for clearing public school properties, and a committee for handling enemy properties, to specifically assist the People's Government in carrying out various tasks. Because the representatives elected or appointed in various places have universal representativeness and can represent the broad masses of people in putting forward opinions, it greatly facilitates the People's Government in absorbing opinions from all walks of life and conveying and implementing various resolutions. After the closing of the People's Representative Conference, the Hui representatives of Changde County immediately convened a Hui people's conference to explain that only under the leadership of the Communist Party can ethnic minorities have freedom and equality, and called on the Hui people to work hard to support the front line.

　　华中三万人以上城市　
    召开各界代表会
    【新华社汉口二十四日电】华中各省人口三万以上的城市，纷纷召开各界人民代表会。湖南的长沙、常德，江西的南昌、九江，湖北的襄樊、老河口、宜昌、郧阳（属陕南行署管辖），河南的郑州、商邱、开封、洛阳，均已先后召开。湖北的鄂城、新堤也正在筹备召开中。各地的各界代表会中，都由当地人民政府向代表们作工作报告，检查了过去的工作，商讨了今后工作方针及任务。通过这些会议，人民政府和群众的联系更加密切了，各界人民参加生产建设的积极性和创造性也大为提高，对今后工作都提出许多建设性的意见，对妨碍生产发展的现象则提出批评。如襄樊各界人民代表会在讨论劳资问题时，批评了个别资本家以关门威胁工人等妨碍生产的错误行为，同时也检讨了工人对工资问题的过高要求，因而明确认识了只有正确执行劳资两利政策，才能发展生产。如郧阳市地处偏僻，恢复生产首先要解决土产外销问题，故着重讨论并解决了发展公私贸易，发展船运及组织土产外销诸问题。湖南常德解放不久，各界人民最关心的是社会治安问题，代表们会议上即纷纷要求迅速建立革命秩序，肃清土匪特务残余，并对军民合作剿匪及防火防空诸问题，提出许多宝贵的意见和具体的办法。这些会议证明，各界人民代表会不但有助于解放较久的城市生产的恢复及发展，就是对新解放城市人民协助军事管制工作，也能起很大的作用。各地并根据当地实际情况解决了许多具体问题，如老河口各界人民代表决议行店斗秤由政府统一规定，市街房屋不准拆卖等，都是当地群众生活上最迫切的要求；襄樊成立了税收评议委员会，清理公学产业及处理敌产委员会等四个委员会，专门协助人民政府进行各项工作。由于各地选举或聘请的代表有普遍的代表性，能够代表广大人民提出意见，大大便利了人民政府吸收各界意见及传达贯彻各种决议。常德县回民代表在各界代表会闭幕后，立即召开回民大会，说明只有在共产党领导下少数民族才有自由与平等，号召回民努力支援前线。
