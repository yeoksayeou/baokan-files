When the students of Peking University heard the good news, they were eating, and there was a burst of cheers and the sound of bowls and plates. As soon as the students of the High School attached to the Normal University heard the news, they rushed to the streets. Everyone took out their washbasins, knocked and jumped, and held a victory parade. Students from Xinhua Middle School also lit red lanterns and paraded with flags high.

　　When the good news reached Wuhan, the capital of Central China, the youth work cadres of the Wuhan Federation of Trade Unions, who were in a meeting, were overjoyed and immediately decided to send a telegram to the People's Liberation Army who liberated Guangzhou to express their congratulations. The telegram said: "We young workers in Wuhan will resolutely support you with increased production, completely eliminate the remaining bandits, and liberate the whole of China!" The dockworkers said: Well, there will be more work in the future.
　　The people of Shanghai joyfully welcomed the good news of the liberation of Guangzhou. Wenhui Daily and Xinwen Daily both published extra editions.
