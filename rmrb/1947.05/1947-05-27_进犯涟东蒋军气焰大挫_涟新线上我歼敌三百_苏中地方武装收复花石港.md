Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 22nd: A unit of the Northern Jiangsu People's Liberation Army annihilated nearly 300 enemies "suppressing" Liandong near Beidachengji on the Lian (Shui) Xin (Anzhen) highway on the 11th, seizing nine machine guns, more than 70 rifles and short guns, 80 bayonets, and more than 10,000 rounds of ammunition. That morning, the direct unit of Chiang Kai-shek's 44th Division forced more than 2,000 new recruits to travel from Xin'anzhen to Lianshui City. A battalion of the 448th Regiment was on guard along the north side of the highway. When the latter reached Yanzhuang near Dachengji, it was surrounded by the ambushing Liberation Army. After fierce fighting until 3 pm, the entire enemy force was wiped out, killing or wounding 200, including the company commander, and capturing more than 90 enemy soldiers, including company commanders. Two battalions of enemy reinforcements from Dachengji were repelled twice. When the division's direct unit and the new recruits reached Wugang, they were again attacked fiercely by the Liberation Army, abandoning countless carts of military supplies and fleeing in panic to Lianshui and Xin'anzhen. The battle ended at dusk. Note: Chiang Kai-shek's 44th Division reoccupied the Huai-Shu road in late April, "suppressing" Lianshui County, and recently crossed the Yanhai River to "suppress" Liandong. After this heavy blow, its arrogance was greatly reduced, and the initial plan to "suppress" Liandong was shattered.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 23rd: A unit of the local armed forces of the Ninth Sub-district of Jiangsu and Anhui, taking advantage of the Chiang Kai-shek army's 105th Brigade's comprehensive "mopping up" of the coastal (Nantong) and Ru (Gao) East areas, used penetrating tactics to advance to the east side of the Tong-Ru Highway on the 15th, and captured the Huashi Street stronghold, seven miles west of Shigang, in one fell swoop, completely annihilating the defending enemy, seizing four machine guns and more than 50 rifles. The defending enemies at Chenjia Hotel west of Tong and Wuguanyintang west of Shigang all retreated in a panic. According to reports, the enemy's "mopping up" began on May 4th, with the remnants of the 79th Brigade blockading the Li (Bao) @ (Cha) line, and the entire 105th Brigade conducting an internal "suppression." After this surprise attack by the local armed forces in the area, they were forced to hurriedly transfer forces west to reinforce, and the "suppression" deployment was disrupted.

　　进犯涟东蒋军气焰大挫
  　涟新线上我歼敌三百
  　苏中地方武装收复花石港
    【新华社华中二十二日电】苏北人民解放军一部，十一日于涟（水）新（安镇）公路北大程集附近，歼“清剿”涟东之敌近三百，缴机枪九挺，长短枪七十余支，刺刀八十把，子弹万余发。是日晨，蒋四十四师直属队等强押新兵两千余人由新安镇前往涟水城，四四八团一个营在公路北沿途警戒，后者行至大程集附近严庄时，被预伏之解放军包围，激战至下午三时，将该敌全部歼灭，毙伤其连长以下二百余，俘敌连指挥员以下九十余。大程集敌两个营二次增援，均被击退。该师直属队及新兵行至五港时，又遭解放军猛袭，丢下小车军需品无数，仓惶分窜涟水、新安镇，战斗至薄暮结束。按：蒋军四四师上月下旬重占淮沭路，“清剿”涟水县，近又东渡盐河，“清剿”涟东，经此痛击，其气焰大低；“清剿”涟东计划初步被粉碎。
    【新华社华中二十三日电】苏皖九分区地方武装一部，趁蒋军一○五旅全面“扫荡”沿海之（南）通、如（皋）东地区时，以穿心战术于十五日挺向通如公路东侧，一举攻克石港西七里之花市街据点，全歼守敌，缴机枪四挺，步枪五十余支。通西陈家酒店及石港西之吴观音堂守敌，皆狼狈撤退。按敌之“扫荡”自五月四日开始，以七十九旅残部封锁李（堡）＠（茶）线，一○五旅全部进行内线“清剿”，经该区地方武装此次奇袭后，被迫仓惶西调增援，“清剿”部署乃告紊乱。
