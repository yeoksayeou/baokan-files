  　Leads Refugees in Rebuilding Their Homes
    [Report from the North Henan Front, May 24th] The Tangyin Democratic Government is leading the citizens in rebuilding the homes destroyed by the Chiang Kai-shek puppet regime. Out of the city's 22,686 citizens, the houses of 3,160 people were demolished by the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops, and their belongings were looted. Among them, the six gates suffered the most severe damage. Within the gates, a total of 550 households, 547 of their houses were destroyed. After the Democratic Government entered the city, it immediately distributed 324 shi of grain for emergency relief, and recently distributed clothing for relief. One citizen said: "The Chiang's army robbed me of three pieces of clothing, and the Eighth Route Army gave me five pieces, a blanket, and an overcoat." In addition, refugees are organized to demolish the Chiang Kai-shek puppet bunkers and buildings on the city walls, and use these materials to repair dilapidated houses. At the same time, they are actively registering public houses in the city, which will be rationally allocated to completely solve the housing problem. (Fang De)
