Xinhua News Agency, Ji-Lu-Yu Front, 29th: Local troops of the Ji-Lu-Yu People's Liberation Army, in coordination with operations in Shandong, have been launching offensives in recent days. On the 26th, they recovered the county towns of Dong'a and Pingyin. The defending enemy fled to Changqing and Jinan.

This newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu Front, 29th: A unit of the Ji-Lu-Yu People's Armed Forces captured the Houyuanzi stronghold northeast of Kaocheng on the 24th, wiping out all of the more than 180 enemy troops of the local tyrant Zhang Shenghai. A total of over fifty enemies, including the battalion commander and below, were killed, and one hundred and twenty captives were taken, including the company commander and below. The captured items included one mortar, nine light and heavy machine guns, one hundred and forty-eight rifles and pistols, forty shells, five thousand rounds of ammunition, and one radio station.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 30th: Before the Battle of Tai'an, the vast people's guerrilla forces in Tai'an, Taining, and Mengshan annihilated more than a thousand enemies in the east of the Jinpu Railway in twenty days, providing powerful coordination for the People's Liberation Army to recover Tai'an. The KMT sentries in Tai'an City were repeatedly killed and wounded by the guerrillas. KMT soldiers in the city secretly kept propaganda leaflets distributed by the guerrillas, preparing to lay down their weapons when the People's Liberation Army attacked the city. Militias in Loude Town, Cuyang District, Taining County, and other places captured KMT special agents and "Homecoming Corps" day and night around enemy strongholds, laid many landmines, and intercepted the enemy's advance. They also thoroughly destroyed the Xin (Tai) Meng (Yin) highway, preventing the KMT army from escaping.

Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 30th: The "Fuzhou" unit of the East China People's Liberation Army shot down an American-made KMT fighter plane at 10:00 AM on the 26th on the Tai'an front. The fuselage crashed in Changjiazhuang, fifteen miles northwest of the city, bearing the number PM4032, manufactured in Ohio, USA.

Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 30th: The "Fuzhou" unit of the East China People's Liberation Army created a glorious battle example in the battle to seize Mount Haoli, which dominates the southwest of Tai'an City. On the night of the 24th, war hero Zhang Xianjun's battalion broke through the KMT trenches, barbed wire, and two rows of deer fences with lightning speed, and then launched a fierce bayonet battle with the KMT troops, who were fiercely counterattacking under dense firepower, at the southern foot of the mountain. Liu Changan's squad of the first company defeated the KMT's repeated charges and occupied a strong firepower point on the south of the mountain. Soldiers Du Lianxue and others from the seventh squad of the third company repelled more than ten desperate counterattacks by the enemy and occupied the top of the mountain. At dawn on the 25th, Chen Yaoxian, deputy commander of the 39th Regiment of the 13th Brigade of the KMT 72nd Division, led two companies in a hurried rescue, disregarding heavy casualties and scurrying to the top of the mountain.

During the battle, Xu Guangming, Sun Shanyou, and Xia Qipan, three heroes from the second platoon of the second company of a certain regiment, after capturing a KMT light machine gun, lost contact with the troops and stubbornly resisted the fierce attacks of dozens of times as many KMT troops on a corner of the mountain more than twenty times. Xu Guangming used the newly captured eleven rifles to guard a bunker, taking turns shooting at the enemies on both sides. The two heroes, Sun and Xia, used a machine gun to block a large group of KMT troops that were rushing over. A KMT officer foolishly tried to lure them, saying: "Surrender, being a Ba Lu (Eighth Route Army Soldier) doesn't pay well." The heroes replied: "We will work for the people to the end, don't be cannon fodder for Chiang Kai-shek." They held out until they joined forces with the main attacking force.

At 5:20 PM on the 25th, the artillery of the unit was ordered to bombard the KMT troops on Mount Haoli. The third gunner, Wang Yiming, hit a large bunker halfway up the mountain with his first shot, and the first gunner, Wang Zemin, hit a large pillbox standing at the southern foot of the mountain with three consecutive shots. The barrage rumbled in the valley, and the shells flew like raindrops towards the KMT fortifications. Soldiers from a certain battalion rushed to the top of the mountain from three sides in ten minutes, and all the defending enemies were annihilated and captured. Their deputy commander, Chen Yaoxian, was killed, and Mount Haoli was completely occupied by the People's Liberation Army. Mount Haoli is close to the west gate of Tai'an City. From the mountain, one can overlook the entire city. The Jinpu Railway turns to the northwest from the east of the mountain. The steep cliffs behind the mountain form a natural barrier. It is an important western barrier of Tai'an City. The KMT army dug complex fortifications, with winding tunnels and underground "fire nests" as dense as honeycombs, attempting to hold on firmly; but the People's Liberation Army conquered it in just one day and night.

　　主动出击配合泰安之战
    冀鲁豫克东阿平阴
    津浦路东人民游击队二十天歼敌千余
    【新华社冀鲁豫前线二十九日电】冀鲁豫人民解放军地方兵团配合山东作战连日出击，二十六日收复东阿、平阴两县城。守敌窜往长清、济南。
    【本报冀鲁豫前线二十九日电】冀鲁豫人民武装一部，二十四日攻克考城东北之后园子据点，守敌土顽张盛孩部一百八十余名全部就歼。计毙敌大队长以下五十余，俘中队长以下一百二十人，缴迫击炮一门，轻重机枪九挺，长短枪一百四十八枝，炮弹四十发，子弹五千发，电台一部。
    【新华社山东三十日电】泰安战役前，泰安、泰宁、蒙山广大人民游击队，二十天中在津浦路东歼敌千余名，予人民解放军收复泰安以有力配合。泰安城关蒋军哨兵屡遭游击队杀伤，城内蒋士兵暗存游击队散发之宣传品，准备解放军攻城时放下武器。泰宁县徂阳区楼德镇等地民兵日夜在敌据点周围捕捉蒋特“还乡团”，广埋地雷，截阻敌人前进。并将新（泰）蒙（阴）公路彻底破坏，使蒋军无法逃窜。
    【新华社华东前线三十日电】华东人民解放军“福州”部队二十六日上午十时在泰安前线击落美造蒋战斗机一架，机身堕于城西北十五里之常家庄，上有号码ＰＭ４０３２，系在美国俄亥俄州制造者。
    【新华社华东前线三十日电】华东人民解放军“福州”部队在夺取雄踞泰安城西南之蒿里山战斗中，创造光辉战例。战争英雄张先军营于二十四日午夜以迅雷之势突破蒋军壕沟、铁丝网及两道鹿砦，即与在密集火力掩护下猛烈反扑之蒋军于山南麓展开激烈白刃战。一连刘常安班击溃蒋军反复冲杀，占领山南强大火力点。三连七班战士杜连学等三人击退敌十余次绝望反扑，占领山顶。二十五日拂晓蒋七十二师新十三旅三十九团副团长陈耀先率两个连急急来援，不顾惨重伤亡窜至山顶。
    战斗中，某团二连二排徐光明、孙善友、夏其盘三勇士于缴获蒋军轻机枪一挺后，与部队失去联系，在山之一角顽强抵抗数十倍之蒋军猛攻达二十次以上。徐光明以新缴获的十一支步枪守卫一座碉堡，轮流射击两侧敌人。孙夏二勇士以一挺机枪堵住了冲过来的大队蒋军。蒋军军官愚蠢的诱骗说：“缴枪吧，干八路没钱花。”勇士们答道：“我们为人民干到底，你们不要给蒋介石当炮灰了。”他们一直坚守到与进攻主力会合。
    二十五日下午五时二十分，该部炮兵奉命向蒿里山蒋军轰击，三炮手王一明第一炮即命中山半腰之大地堡，一炮手王则明三炮连中矗立于山南麓之大炮楼，排炮在山谷间隆隆作响，炮弹雨点样飞向蒋军工事。某营健儿十分钟即从三面冲上山顶，守敌悉被歼俘，其副团长陈耀先被击毙，蒿里山即被解放军全部占领。按蒿里山紧靠泰安城西关，登山可俯瞰全城，津浦路由山之东转向西北，山后陡岩峭壁，形成天堑，为泰安城西险要屏障，蒋军挖筑复杂工事，坑道曲折，地下“火力巢”密如蜂窝，企图固守；但人民解放军仅一昼夜即将其攻克。（附图片）
