[Taiyue Dispatch, 16th of this month] On the 15th of last month, 5,000 people in Yicheng County held a public trial of the arch-criminals and special agent ringleaders Zhang Hongde and Wang Guangzhou at a rally celebrating the third liberation of the county. Zhang Hongde served as the head of the Kuomintang Yicheng County Public Security Bureau in 1943, and committed evil deeds together with the Kuomintang County Magistrate Ma Songting, killing more than a hundred people using cruel methods such as live burial and waist chopping. In 1944, when Kuomintang County Magistrate Ma Songting crossed to the west, Zhang Hongde had nowhere to hide, so he feigned surrender to our side, and then betrayed and turned against us again, serving as the head of the Chiang Kai-shek puppet No. 5 Regiment. Last year, he made a comeback and continued to commit all kinds of evil. In villages such as Shiniutuo, Shengou, Laoguanzhuang, and Hezhuang, he killed several of our cadres, arrested dozens of militiamen, injured dozens of ordinary people, and extorted more than three million yuan per month. Wang Guangzhou previously served as the puppet county magistrate in Linfen, and the people called him "the essence of killing," often stir-frying and eating human hearts. When he was the head of the 13th Security Regiment, he forcibly conscripted thousands of young people from Quwo into the army. In the second month of this year, he came to Yicheng as the puppet county magistrate, and again robbed 500 shi of wheat and demolished more than 100 civilian houses. Countless corpses were filled in wells such as Beiguan, Nanguan, and Beimen, and the people hated him to the bone, and demanded his execution. The government accepted the people's demands and executed the criminals, which greatly pleased the people.

　　翼城人民悲愤复仇  公审枪决杀人蒋特
    【本报太岳十六日电】上月十五日，翼城五千群众在庆祝该县三次解放大会上，公审罪大恶极之特务头子张鸿德、王光宙二逆。张鸿德于四三年任顽翼城县公安局长，与顽县长马松亭共同作恶，以活埋腰斩等残酷手段杀害群众百余人，四四年顽县长马松亭西渡，张鸿德无处藏身，乃伪降我方，旋又叛变附逆，充任蒋伪保五团团长。去年卷土重来，仍是无恶不作，在石牛凸、神沟、老官庄、河庄等村杀害我干部数人，抓走民兵数十人，伤害老百姓数十人，每月勒索款项在三百万元以上。王光宙过去在临汾任伪县长，群众称他为“杀人精”，经常炒吃人心，在任保安十三团团长时，把曲沃数千青年强编当兵。今后二月间到翼城任伪县长，又抢麦子五百石，拆毁民房百余间。北关、南关、北门等井内，被填死尸无数，群众恨之入骨，纷纷要求枪决，政府接受群众要求，即将该犯执行枪决，人心大快。
