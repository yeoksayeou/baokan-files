Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 14th. The "Border Region Masses' News" of Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia published a short commentary entitled "Three Cobblers Can Outwit a Zhuge Liang," praising the creations of Lei Pingta and Li Jiagou's front and rear mutual-aid production, stating: This mutual-aid, on the one hand, ensures that people in the large rivers do not idle due to lack of land, and cattle in the small gullies do not stop plowing due to lack of labor. On the other hand, it enables small gullies to organize cattle power to return labor to the large rivers for short-term rush planting, ensuring normal production and timely sowing during wartime, without delaying either the large rivers or the small gullies. The method adopted by the masses in Li Jiagou for resettling immigrants not only solves the difficulties in the lives of immigrants from enemy-occupied areas, but also enables them to exert their labor and expands and guarantees wartime production in their own villages, benefiting both the public and the private. It is hoped that the above experience will attract the attention of leading organs in various places, and that they will promote these valuable experiences, spread them throughout the region, and inspire the masses to use their wisdom to come up with various ways to suit wartime production and solve the difficulties of immigrants, so that "people can use their talents to the fullest, and land can be used to its greatest potential," thereby strengthening wartime production.

　　群众报评安塞创造
    人不因无地休闲  牛不因无人停耕
    【新华社西北十四日电】陕甘宁“边区群众报”特以“三个臭皮匠能顶一个诸葛亮”为题发表短论，评雷平塌、李家沟前后方变工生产的创造称：这一变工，一方面使大川的人不因无地休闲，小沟的牛不因缺人停耕的，一方面又使小沟组织牛力至大川还工，进行短期抢种，战时得以照常生产按时下种，大川小沟两不耽误。李家沟群众安置移民的办法，不但解决了敌占区移民的生活困难，而且使其能发挥劳力，并扩大与保证了本村的战时生产，公私两利。以上经验，希望引起各地领导机关的重视，并发扬这些宝贵经验，推广全区，启发群众发挥智慧，更多的想出各种各样适合战时生产及解决移民困难的办法，使得“人尽其力，地尽其利”加强战时生产。
