(From Our Correspondent in Henan North) As the Henan North Campaign achieves successive victories, the situation in the Fourth Sub-district of the Taihang region is greatly expanding. Now, with the exception of a few strongholds along the Daokou-Qinghua Railway, the vast countryside and strongholds like Wenbei City have been recovered. The masses' movement to oppose traitors, bullies, and reverse verdicts is rapidly and enthusiastically unfolding. As of the end of April, in Xiuwu, 37 villages (administrative villages) are now under our control, and the masses have been mobilized in 30 of them. In Wuzhi, all four districts have launched struggles. In the Boai (south of the Daokou-Qinghua Railway), 17 villages have taken action. In Qinyang, all but the seventh district have seen struggles. This movement has shown three characteristics:

First, the movement has been very rapid and vigorous, not one village at a time, but in clusters. For example, after activists from the Second District of Xiuwu held a meeting and returned, within seven days, 12 villages (including 62 natural villages) ignited the flames of a vigorous counter-traitor revenge and general liquidation struggle. A total of 365 struggles were carried out, 125 targets of struggle were judged by the masses, and 21 special agents and traitor-bullies received their due retribution. A special agent in Xigou was so frightened that he died before the struggle even began. The people said, "This is truly a guilty conscience, deserving of such an end." The masses recovered more than 50 hectares of land. The same was true in Wuzhi. After activists from the Third District held a meeting and returned, they linked up eight villages within two days. The masses showed tension and joy in this very rapid and vigorous struggle. In Waiyao Village, Xiuwu, with over 70 households, during the Henan North Campaign, they prepared 5,000 catties of firewood and 600 catties of grass in two days, as well as hundreds of catties of white flour. In this tense action, struggle was brewing. On the third day, the struggle began, and the fruits were distributed immediately after the struggle. Their slogan was: "Struggle and distribute, struggle quickly and distribute quickly." The masses in Poqian Village participated in the war during the day and struggled at night. Men participated in the war, and women struggled. One day they were so happy that after the struggle, the masses stayed overnight in the bully's house and spontaneously sang all the old songs from the past several times. The masses everywhere were excitedly saying, "This is seeing the light of day again!"

Second, the masses showed a "determination to fight," shattering the cadres' original misconception that the masses dared not struggle. When the struggle meeting was held in Xiaoluozhuang, Xiuwu, because the bully was detained in Fucheng, Lingchuan, and had not been brought over yet, the masses unanimously said, "We will not adjourn the meeting even if we have to wait three more days." Under the passionate emotions of the masses, militia members immediately volunteered to go to Fucheng overnight to arrest the criminal. When the bully was brought back, the masses followed along the road to struggle. When the Tudouzhang was holding a struggle meeting, the enemy came, and the masses moved the meeting place and continued the struggle, and sent militia to resolutely strike at the enemy. After the masses in Daguanzhuang, Second District, were mobilized, they automatically dug tunnels and transformed the terrain and streets. They said, "We will defend our own home." After Xiazhuang was surrounded by the enemy, the cadres and militia resolutely resisted. After the enemy retreated, the determination to struggle was even greater, and they unanimously wanted to capture the two bullies in their village alive. An old man in Gaocun, Wuzhi, confessed his thoughts to everyone and said, "If something happens to me in the future, I ask everyone to avenge me, and be sure to fight desperately."

Third, with the development of the movement, the masses universally and urgently demanded that we give them weapons to protect their lives and property and homes, protect the fruits, and protect the benefits of liberation. After a week of mass mobilization in Xiuwu, the militia developed to more than 300 people, and old men also joined the militia. An old man in Village X said, "Even if you give me a grenade, that will be fine." Under the slogan of joining the victorious army, preparing for a major counter-offensive, defeating Chiang Kai-shek, in order to thoroughly liberate ourselves, defend Chairman Mao, defend the land, and defend the fruits, more than 320 young people automatically signed up for the army in one night, far exceeding the target of 150 people. In Qinyang, under the firm demand of the masses for self-defense, the explosion movement rapidly unfolded, directly threatening the suburbs.

　　豫北群众重见天日
    到处点火反奸复仇
    【本报豫北讯】随着豫北战役的节节胜利，太行四分区的局面大有开展，现在除道清线上几个据点外，广大乡村以及温北城等据点均已收复，群众反奸霸反倒算的复仇运动，迅速热烈的开展起来了，截至四月底止，修武现为我控制村庄三十七个（行政村），已有三十个村发动了群众。武陟四个区都发动了斗争，博（爱）南（道清路南）已有十七个村行动起来。沁阳除七区外，其他六个区均有斗争。此次运动中，表现了三个特点：
    第一、运动表现非常迅速猛烈一起来就不是一个一个村的，而是一片一片的；如修武二区积极分子开罢会回去后，七天内即有十二个村（包括六十二个自然村），掀起了轰轰烈烈的反奸复仇总清算斗争的火焰，一共斗争三百六十五次，一百二十五个斗争对象，受到了群众的裁判，二十一个特务奸霸遭到了应有的报复。西沟一个特务还未斗就吓死了，老百姓说：“这真是偷了人的心虚，罪该如此。”群众共收回土地五十多顷。武陟也是这样，三区积极分子开会回去后，二天内就串连了八个村，群众在这非常迅速猛烈的斗争中表现紧张愉快；修武外窑村七十余户，在豫北战役中，二天就准备了五千斤烧柴，六百斤草，还有几百斤白面。在这紧张的行动中，又酝酿了斗争。第三天就开始斗争，斗后立即分配果实，他们的口号是：“随斗随分，快斗快分”。坡前村群众白天参战，夜间斗争。男人参战，妇女斗争，有一天他们太高兴了，斗争罢，群众在恶霸家住了一夜，自发的把过去的旧歌子都唱了几遍，群众到处都兴奋的说：“这算重见天日了！”
    第二、群众表现出有“决斗思想”，干部原有群众不敢斗争的错觉被打破了。修武小罗庄开斗争会时，因恶霸被扣于陵川附城一时未提来，群众一致说：“再等三天也不散会”在群情激昂下，当场即有民兵自动报名连夜到附城抓案去。恶霸带回来时，群众沿路即跟来斗争。土斗掌正开斗争会，敌人来了，群众把会场转移了，仍继续斗争，并派出民兵坚决打击敌人。二区大官庄群众发动后，自动挖地道，改造地形和街道，他们说：“我们自己守我们的家”。下庄被敌包围后，干部民兵坚决抵抗，敌退后斗争决心更大，一致要活捉本村的二个恶霸。武陟高村一老汉向大家表白了自己的心思话后，说：“如果我日后出了事，要求大家为我报仇，一定要拚命的干。”
    第三、随着运动的开展，群众普遍的迫切要求我们给他们武器，保卫自己的生命财产和家园，保卫果实，保卫翻身利益。修武经过一礼拜的群众发动，民兵就发展了三百余人，老汉也参加了民兵，×村一老汉说：“那怕给我一颗手榴弹也行。”在参加胜利军，准备大反攻，打败蒋介石，才能翻透身，保卫毛主席，保卫土地，保卫果实要参军的口号下，一个晚上即有三百二十余名青年自动报名参军，远超过一百五十名的任务。沁阳在群众坚决要求自卫下，爆炸运动迅速开展直迫城郊。
