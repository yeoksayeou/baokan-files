　　【This dispatch from Taiyue on the 2nd】Production mutual aid is being carried out between villages in the mountainous and plain areas of Hongtong First District. Thirty percent of the First District's land is used for cotton, but just as planting season began, the Jinan Battle started, and many laborers and livestock from the mountainous area went to support the front lines. The district office immediately convened a meeting of village cadres from the entire district on April 31st to discuss how to overcome the current difficulties in production manpower and livestock. The ×× village in the plains (five li from the city) volunteered to send five teams of livestock to help the Fangdui and other villages in the mountainous area with harvesting and planting. Subsequently, more than ten villages around the city offered to send manpower and livestock to help with production in the mountainous areas, and requested the mountains to help them achieve liberation and develop large-scale mutual assistance in production. Li Zhe, the principal of a people's university, also announced on the spot that he would personally lead all students to carry out rush planting for six days for military families, cadres, families of martyrs, and honorably discharged veterans.
