From the introduction by the Qin County Party Committee to this newsletter, it can be seen that Qin County district cadres have different opinions on the combination of production and mass movement. We are publishing this for reference in various regions, hoping that counties can continue to provide such materials or raise opinions for discussion on this issue.

    I. Two Situations

    1. Mass Movement Situation: The people of Qin County launched 5,808 struggles of grievance, revenge, liquidation, and denunciation against feudal landlords, traitors, and local bullies in eight months. They reclaimed land accounting for 54% of the county's fertile land, or 15.6% of the total land area (totaling 85,000 mu), returning it to the peasants. In terms of achieving land to the tiller: villages that eliminated landlords, greatly reduced the number of the poverty stricken and poor peasants, such as Nanchen, accounted for 52.3% (23) of the administrative villages and 56% (57) of the natural villages in the county. Secondly, villages where the remnants of feudalism (referring to movable property) were not completely eliminated, or cadres gained too many fruits, or fruits were retained and not properly distributed, or middle peasants were wrongly struggled against and not fully compensated, accounted for 31% (20) of the administrative villages and 38.2% (39) of the natural villages in the county. Furthermore, villages like Kaicun, where the masses' thinking was not thoroughly mobilized, the class ranks were not clearly demarcated, and not only were feudal forces not thoroughly defeated, but they even controlled village administration and restricted the mass movement, accounted for 18.5% (12) of the administrative villages and 15.7% (16) of the natural villages.

    2. Mass Spring Plowing Situation: The county's cultivated land area is 457,167 mu, of which autumn fields account for 73%, totaling 333,732 mu, while the total labor force (excluding 1,181 industrial and commercial workers, teachers, doctors, and other full laborers not engaged in agriculture) is 10,632, with each person averaging 31 mu of cultivated land; however, due to various miscellaneous affairs such as official duties, illness, and rain, each person can only cultivate 20 mu of land. Even if the 7,448 male semi-laborers are mobilized to participate in agricultural production, they can cultivate 74,480 mu of land, accounting for only 63% of the remaining land. Therefore, it is necessary to organize 40% to 50% of the male full and semi-labor force to implement mutual aid to ensure that no land is left uncultivated. From the perspective of livestock, the county has a total of 4,575 heads of livestock. After deducting 13% that cannot plow the land (totaling 595 heads), each head of livestock can cultivate 50 mu of land, totaling 200,000 mu of cultivated land. There is still more than 31% of the land that may be left uncultivated due to the lack of livestock to plow. In addition, less than one-third of the land was plowed last autumn, and frost damage has greatly reduced yields. According to a survey in Yaoshang, 30% of households are experiencing spring or wheat shortages, and some livestock are forced to engage in transportation production to survive the shortages. Even if all female full laborers (totaling 12,411) are mobilized to participate in agricultural production, and work coordination is implemented with male full and semi-laborers, and everyone does their best to the highest degree, the goal of plowing all the land twice cannot be achieved.

    II. Unifying Understanding and Determining the Guidelines

    Due to the above two situations, a debate arose between "vigorously implementing the mass movement" or "making a sprint for spring plowing," summarized as follows:

    The first view is: Since the mass movement has not ended, we should strike while the iron is hot and do it in one go; otherwise, the masses' enthusiasm for struggle will decline. Mobilizing again after spring plowing is like "not drinking boiled water and waiting for it to cool before cooking again," which is time-consuming and laborious.

    The second view is: If the mass movement is not thorough, the distribution of fruits is unreasonable, and the masses have not completely turned themselves over, we must kick away this stumbling block before we can carry out production and spring plowing.

    The third view is: Sprinting for spring plowing and implementing the mass movement cannot be combined in one period. Either fully implement the mass movement or fully sprint for spring plowing. This way, tasks are concentrated, and strength is concentrated, so that nothing will be accomplished.

    After a fierce debate among Party, government, and people's county and district cadres, after analyzing the situation and weighing the pros and cons, the following views were held on the above three opinions:

    1. The leadership's thinking has not been aligned with the masses' thinking. The work spirit of "striking while the iron is hot and doing it in one go" must be based on the masses' urgent demands within a certain period. The "unique" leadership content must be based on the thought that there is only one requirement. Currently, some feudal forces have not been thoroughly eradicated in the mass movement, and the masses are indeed dissatisfied with the unreasonable distribution of fruits, but "if you don't plant in the spring, you'll starve all year," has become a universal cry of the masses. If we ignore spring plowing and force the masses to divide the fruits and cut off the tails of feudalism, it won't work.

    2. Insufficient understanding of the essence of the remaining issues. The remaining issues in the land mainly concern the issue of cadres gaining too many fruits. This issue is about adjusting the wealth of peasant brothers' families, not about peasants taking back land from landlords. The peasants' thinking is that "as long as we have a share in the mountains, we are not afraid of not being able to chop firewood," indicating that the masses are not eager to delay spring plowing because of the fruits; secondly, it is the issue of the tails of feudalism. Most of the remaining tails of feudalism involve peaceful methods of exploitation and do not have bad relations with the masses. The masses keep them. In the future, the main form of struggle will be to let them admit their mistakes and bow their heads to the masses. The masses in Daixian Village reflected that the fruits obtained from cutting off the tails of feudalism were not many, saying that "cutting off the tails of feudalism is not as good as cutting firewood," which shows that it does not play a big role in land to the tiller.

    3. Looking at dynamic things with static eyes: The 85,000 mu of land plundered from peasants by traitors and bullies, who are deeply hated by the masses, have been completely recovered, and the peasants have already become the masters of the land. If the peasants were willing to give up their own production last year to fight against the landlords, this year they would rather not have the fruits, or ask the cadres to rationally distribute the fruits and make a good spring plowing. The level of enthusiasm for the peasants' struggle, whether high or intermittent, mainly depends not on the persistence or skills of the leaders, but on the magnitude of the struggle's content and the peasants' own interests, as well as the level of their awareness.

    Finally, the thinking tended to be consistent, and "vigorously sprinting for spring plowing and seizing every opportunity to solve the remaining problems" became Qin County's work guideline for the current two months.

    III. Organizational Leadership Methods for Implementing the Guidelines

    1. The three thousand Party, government, people's county, district, and village cadres, turned-over heroes, and labor heroes were divided into districts to carry out a major ideological mobilization, clarifying the relationship between sprinting for spring plowing and implementing the mass movement, and overcoming the masses' fear of getting rich, fear of struggle, and fear of burdens, as well as the cadres' existing "self-flowing consciousness" of "not leading the masses and they will still produce."

    2. Except for a few who remain to persist in their work in the organs, the rest all go deep into various base points and villages in a planned way, implementing the "masses going to the land, cadres going to the land, masses demanding much, and cadres leading the resolution of much" style. In leading production, we organize and deliberate on the remaining issues of the mass movement, and use the gaps in agricultural time (rain, night, noon break, etc.) to solve problems. If we encounter major problems, we deliberate for a long time and resolve them at the end of spring plowing.

    3. Formulate various model conditions, call for striving to become models, and launch a meritorious service or extra meritorious service movement to solve the relationship between cadres and the masses through meritorious service.

    4. Implement the leadership method of breaking through one point to promote the overall situation in leadership. Due to the restrictions of agricultural seasons, fearing that it will be difficult to promote in a timely manner after obtaining experience, in addition to dispersing a part of the cadres to various villages; we also divide thirteen main and secondary base points according to various types of areas (mass movement ended and not ended, new areas and old areas, labor difficulties or not, different production conditions, etc.) to obtain experience (mainly organizing the combination of the mass movement), in order to promote various different types of areas, creating a universally lively and hot production upsurge in the county.

### 全力春耕还是继续查田？  沁县县区干部关于这一问题的争论

　　全力春耕还是继续查田？
    沁县县区干部关于这一问题的争论
    王志舜
    从沁县县委会介绍的这篇通讯中，可以看出沁县县区干部对生产与群运结合问题的各种不同意见，特刊出供各地参考，希望各县能继续提供这一类材料，或对这一问题提出意见进行讨论。
          ——编者
    一、两种情况
    １、群众运动的情况：沁县人民向封建地主、汉奸、恶霸在八个月内进行了五千八百零八次诉苦复仇清算斗争。他们占有全县肥沃土地百分之五十四或总土地数百分之十五·六的土地（计八万五千亩）重归农民。在实现耕者有其田的程度上看：像南陈那样消灭地主与赤贫及贫农大大减少的村庄，占全县百分之五十二·三（二十三个）的行政村和百分之五十六（五十七个）的自然村。其次是封建尾巴（指动产）未割尽或干部多得果实，或留存果实未分配好，或误斗中农未尽赔偿的村庄，占全县百分之三十一的（二十个）行政村和百分之三十八·二的（三十九个）自然村。再其次像开村那样因群众思想未彻底发动，阶级阵营未划清，不但封建势力在农民阵营中鱼目混珠末予彻底斗垮，甚至还掌握村政、限制群众运动的村庄占百分之十八·五的（十二个）行政村和占百分之十五·七的（十六个）自然村。
    ２、群众春耕情况：全县耕地面积四十五万七千一百六十七亩，秋田占有百分之七三，计三十三万三千七百三十二亩，而全劳力（除去一千一百八十一个工商、教员、医生及其他不从事农业之全劳力外）一万零六百三十二个，每人平均负担耕地三十一亩；但因差务疾病下雨等各种杂务、每人仅能耕地二十亩，再把七千四百四十八个男半劳力动员起来参加农业生产，可耕地七万四千四百八十亩，仅占余地的百分之六十三，因之必须把男全半劳力组织起来百分之四十到五十实行变工互助，才能保证寸地不荒。从畜力上看，全县共有牲口四千五百七十五头，除去百分之十三不能犁地者外（计五百九十五头），每头牲口以耕地五十亩计，共能担负耕地二十万亩，还有占百分之三十一以上的土地，因无畜可犁有荒的可能，加之去年秋垡不及三分之一，霜灾又使产量大减。据窑上调查，有百分之三十的户闹春荒或麦荒，部分牲口又迫于不得不从事运输生产渡荒。即使把全部妇女全劳力（计一万二千四百十一个）动员起来参加农业生产，和男全半劳力实行活计调剂，高度的实行各尽其能各尽其力，也不能达到全部均犁两遍的目的。
    二、统一认识确定方针
    由于上列两种情况，形成了“大力贯彻群运”或“突击春耕”的争论思想基础，归纳起来有下列几种意见：
    第一种是：群运既未结束，即应趁火打铁，一鼓作气，否则群众斗争热情低落，待春耕后再动员，无异“水滚不喝，待冷再炊”费时又费力。
    第二种是：群众运动不彻底，果实分配不合理，群众未翻透身，必须踢开这个绊脚石，才能开展生产春耕运动。
    第三种是：突击春耕和贯彻群运不能在一个时期内结合进行，或全力贯彻群运，或者全力突击春耕，这样任务集中，力量集中，才不会一事无成。
    党政民县区干部激烈的争论后，经分析情况和权衡利害，对以上三种意见认为：
    １、领导思想未和群众思想一致起来。“趁热打铁，一鼓作气”的工作精神，必须建筑在群众一定时间内迫切要求的思想基础上；“独一无二”的领导内容，必须是建筑在只有一个要求的思想基础上。目前在群运中某些封建势力铲除不彻底，果实分配不合理，群众确实不满，但“春天种不上，当年饿断肠”，又成了群众普遍的呼声，如果置春耕于不顾，硬叫群众分果实割尾巴，那就行不通。
    ２、对遗留问题的本质认识不足，土地中的遗留问题，主要为干部多得果实问题，而此问题是农民兄弟家务的调整财富问题，非农民和地主间的夺回土地问题。农民思想中存在着“只要山有股份，不怕不能打柴烧”，说明群众不急于因果实而误春耕；其次是封建尾巴问题，遗留下之封建尾巴大多是剥削方法和平，和群众关系不恶劣，由群众保存下来，今后斗争的形式主要是让其向群众认错低头。待贤村群众因割尾巴所得果实不多，反映是“割尾巴不如割柴火”，足见其对于耕者有其田所起的作用不大。
    ３、静的眼光看动的事物：为群众所深痛恶绝的奸霸掠夺农民的八万五千亩土地完全被收回，农民已经作了土地的主人。如果说去年农民宁可放弃了自己的生产而向地主作斗争，今年则宁可不再要果实，或向干部求得果实合理分配而闹好春耕。农民斗争热情的高低或断续，主要不决定于领导者的坚持性或技术等，而决定于斗争内容和农民切身利害关系之大小及其觉悟程度之高低。
    最后，思想趋向一致，把“大力突击春耕，并争取一切机会解决遗留问题”，成为沁县当前两个月的工作方针。
    三、组织贯彻方针的领导方法
    一、党政民县区村干部翻身英雄劳动英雄三千人分区进行思想大动员，明确突击春耕和贯彻群运的关系，并克服群众怕发财怕斗争怕负担的思想和干部中存在着的“不去领导群众也会生产”的自流意识。
    二、除留少数坚持机关工作者外，余均有计划的深入各基点及村，贯彻“群众上地，干部上地，群众要求甚，干部领导解决甚的作风”。在领导生产中组织酝酿群运遗留问题，利用农时空隙（下雨、黑夜、午歇晌，……等）解决问题，如遇大问题经过长时间酝酿在春耕结束解决之。
    三、制定各种模范条件，号召争取模范，开展立功或加功运动，用立功来解决干群关系。
    四、在领导上贯彻突破一点推动全面的领导方法。由于农事节令的限制，恐取得经验后不易及时推广，因之除分散一部干部到各村外；又依据各种类型地区，（群运结束和未结束，新区和老区，劳力困难不困难，生产条件异同等）划分十三个主要和次要基点取得经验（主要要组织起来和群运结合的经验），以便推广各种不同类型地区，造成全县普遍热火朝天的生产浪潮。
