　　Waiting for Rain is Not an Option During Drought
    The Jinan District Party Committee Calls for Spot Planting to Seize the Season
    [This newspaper's Jinan dispatch on the 11th] The Jinan District Party Committee has urgently called for spot planting to seize the season and prepare for drought and famine. It points out that because of the drought and lack of rain, planting cannot proceed, therefore spot planting to seize the season is the current urgent task. Party, government, military, and civilians at all levels must earnestly organize and promote this work, and must fully lead and organize the masses to launch a sudden campaign of spot planting, and mobilize all manpower and animal power of institutions and troops to help the masses carry water for spot planting, ensuring that not an inch of land is left uncultivated in the garrison area. The call emphasizes the need to overcome the mentality of relying on heaven for rain, and calls on the masses to make good use of well water and river water for spot planting, plant more melons and vegetables, and spot plant cotton or dry sow. In areas where land has not yet been distributed, it should be quickly distributed to farmers so they can turn the soil and plant as soon as possible. If it cannot be distributed temporarily, the farmers' association should quickly organize collective planting. The call also instructs that it is necessary to practice strict economy, oppose waste, and hold fewer village meetings that are shorter in duration, making use of the evenings as much as possible for meetings, so that the vast majority of the masses' time is spent on full-scale, sudden planting and production.

　　天旱不能等雨
    冀南区党委号召点苗抢种
    【本报冀南十一日电】冀南区党委紧急号召点苗抢种，防旱备荒。指出因天旱不雨，不能播种，因此点苗抢种，是目前紧急任务，各级党政军民，必须认真的组织与推动这一工作，必须全力领导与组织群众，突击点苗抢种，并动员机关部队的一切人力与畜力，帮助群众担水点苗，保证驻地不荒一亩地。号召指出必须克服靠天等雨心理，号召群众很好利用井水河水点苗抢种，多种瓜菜，点种棉花或干下种。斗争土地未分配者，应迅速分配给农民，及早翻土下种。一时分配不了的，应迅速由农会集体抢种。号召指示必须厉行节约，反对浪费，村里会议要少，时间要短，尽可能利用晚上开会，使群众绝大部分的时间，用在全力突击点种与生产上。
