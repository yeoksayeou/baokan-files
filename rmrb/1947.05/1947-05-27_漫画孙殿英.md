　　Cartoon of Sun Dianying
    Li Pu
    Sun Dianying is in his sixties this year. When he was young, his family was poor. He lost money gambling and joined the army of the warlord Zhang Zongchang as a groom. Through flattery and bribery, he rose to become a mortar platoon leader. Then he pulled that platoon out to become bandits. Later, he went from bandit to commander-in-chief to major traitor. For decades, he rampaged across North China, and everyone knew him. With a little research into Sun Dianying's life, we will discover that he is one of the great monsters of modern Chinese society, representing the typical forces of decline in current Chinese society. He has the evil blood of semi-feudal society flowing in his veins, and he carries a strong smell of semi-colonialism.
    Henan has many secret society organizations, one of which is called Miaodao. Sun Dianying is the leader of this Miaodao. He has a Longquan sword, which has now been obtained by the People's Liberation Army. The sword is covered in rust, and the reporter could not see anything particularly special about it, but Sun Dianying created many myths around it. According to his subordinates, Sun Dianying had a dream in which a deity gave him this precious sword. Later, following the deity's instructions, he dug it up from the ground. After being captured by the People's Liberation Army, Sun Dianying probably knew that this kind of myth would no longer work, so he simply said that it was inherited from his ancestors. The reporter spoke with several of his lower-level cadres and heard a long string of these ridiculous stories. They said that this precious sword protected Sun Dianying, turning misfortune into good fortune and danger into safety. When the sword itself made a sound or moved, it meant that there were people around Sun Dianying who were unfavorable to him, and that Sun Dianying was about to kill someone.
    Two other items among the seized goods are worth mentioning. One is a piece of white cloth about three feet long and one foot wide. At the top, written horizontally in large characters, are the words "Gao Tu Hong Ji" (告徒红吉), probably used when receiving new disciples. Below these four words are a few lines of incantations: "Gai Putian xia yizi jin, zhong gua xuan wo hong zuren, yu gu mianqian ling jingjuan, tong wo lao mu dan xiaoren" (盖普天下一字金，中卦选我红祖人，玉古面前领经卷，同我老毋胆小人). Below this are more than a dozen lines of fabricated sentences that resemble scriptures or incantations, bizarre and seemingly intelligible. The other item is the draft of the so-called "China Conservative Party Establishment Declaration." I never expected Sun Dianying to have this move, which really surprised me. The article first talked about a lot of China's inherent spirit and morality, and then put forward eight propositions: the first is "exterminating the communist bandits," and the other is even more shameless, the so-called "supporting the government." With these two, there is no need to copy the other six. This big gangster's speculative means are really clever; Chiang Kai-shek will definitely welcome this so-called political party. Among the seized items, there is also some textual evidence of his defection to the enemy, and since the large-scale civil war, for his contribution to attacking the liberated areas, Chiang Kai-shek gave him a commendation order. Originally, this was already a well-known fact, which does not require any proof.
    Perhaps Sun Dianying himself knew that many people recognized him, so when he was captured, he did not follow Chiang Kai-shek's order to disguise himself as a soldier. He was still wearing his khaki serge military uniform, as thin as a rake, with a pale face. He was originally an opium addict who had not seen the sun for a long time. His American-style peaked cap was purple-red, different from others. I don’t know if this is a special mark of the beautified military commanders in Chiang's army, but it only made his face look even more frightening. When I saw him, he was suffering from a cold, shrinking on the kang (炕, a heated brick bed) and moaning. He also resentfully complained about Chiang Kai-shek, complaining that Chiang Kai-shek did not actively rescue him, and then lay on the kang and hummed loudly. Looking at this ridiculous look, a cartoon suddenly popped into my mind. This opium addict is wearing a strange American hat, holding a ridiculous Longquan sword, and using the "Gao Tu Hong Ji" and "Conservative Party Declaration" as the background, embellished with appointments and commendation orders from Okamura Neji and Chiang Kai-shek. Then, the semi-feudal characteristics are there, and the semi-colonial characteristics are there. As a representative of the declining class in this society, he is moaning in the prisoner-of-war camp of the People's Liberation Army. Isn't this a very meaningful scene? Such a scene is very inspiring, right! Whether it is Miaodao, or the Conservative Party; whether it is the Longquan sword, or the American-style hat; and no matter whether it is Chiang Kai-shek, Japan, or the United States, none of them can save him. The era of Sun Dianying and his ilk has passed. All the devils and monsters of the old Chinese society will be swept away. A new China is about to appear. (Attached picture)

　　漫画孙殿英
    李普
    孙殿英今年六十多岁了，小时候家贫，因赌博输了钱投到大军阀张宗昌部下当马夫，以巴结贿赂升到迫击炮连长，接着拉出那一连人来当土匪，以后由匪而总司令、而大汉奸，几十年来纵横华北，真是妇孺皆知。稍稍研究一下孙殿英的一生，我们便将发现这是现代中国社会的大怪物之一，代表着现在中国社会中没落势力的典型。他身上流着半封建社会的罪恶的血，又带着浓烈的半殖民地的臭味。
    河南有许多会门组织，有一个叫做庙道，孙殿英便是这个庙道的首领。他有一柄龙泉剑，这次已给解放军得到了，剑身上长满了铁锈，记者看来看去实在看不出什么奇特之点，可是孙殿英却制造了许多神话。据他的部下传说：有一回孙殿英做了一个梦，一个神仙赐给他这把宝剑，后来依照神仙的指示，从土里挖掘出来。到了解放军之后，孙殿英大概知道这种神话再也吃不开了，只说这是他的祖上遗传下来的。记者和他的几个下级干部谈话，听了一大串这类可笑的故事，他们说这把宝剑护卫着孙殿英，使他逢凶化吉，转危为安，而当这把宝剑自己发出声音或者摆动起来，那就是孙殿英身边出现了不利于他的人；那就是孙殿英要杀人了。
    缴获物中还有两件东西值得提一下，一件是一块长约三尺，宽约一尺的白布，顶上横写的四个大字是：“告徒红吉”，大概是新收徒弟的时候用的，这四个字底下直写着几句咒语，是：“盖普天下一字金，中卦选我红祖人，玉古面前领经卷，同我老毋胆小人”。底下接着是十余句像经文、又像咒语的杜撰文句，离奇古怪，似通非通。另一件是所谓“中国保守党成立宣言”的草稿，想不到孙殿英还有这一手，真是大出我的意料之外。文中首先说了一大套中国固有的精神与道德，然后提出八条主张：第一条就是“剿除共匪”，另一条更无耻，是所谓“拥护政府”。有了这两条别的六条就无须抄录了。这个大流氓的投机手段真是高明，蒋介石是一定会欢迎这种所谓政党的吧。缴获物中还有一些他投敌的文字证据、和大规模内战以来，进攻解放区有功，蒋介石给他的嘉奖令，本来这已是人所实共知的事，无待于证明的了。
    也许孙殿英自己也知道有许多老百姓认识他，因此在被俘的时候没有遵照着蒋介石的命令化装为一个士兵，仍然穿着他的草绿哔叽军服，骨瘦如柴，脸色惨白，原来是一个很久没有见过阳光的鸦片烟鬼。他的美式大盖帽是紫红色的，和别人的不同，不知道这是不是蒋军美化以后部队长官的特殊标帜，可是这只是把他的脸色衬托得更加怕人而已。我看见他的时候，他正患着感冒，缩在炕上呻吟，还悻悻然发了蒋介石两句牢骚，埋怨蒋介石没有积极救援他，然后就躺在炕上大声哼叫起来。看着这种可笑的样子，我脑子里忽然涌出一幅漫画来，这个鸦片烟鬼头上带着奇怪的美式帽，手中拿着可笑的龙泉剑，再以那“告徒红吉”和“保守党宣言”做背景，点缀着冈村宁次和蒋介石的委任状和嘉奖令，那么半封建的特点也有了，半殖民地的特点也有了，做为这个社会的没落阶级的一个代表，他正在人民解放军的俘虏收容所里哀吟着，这不是一个很有意义的镜头吗？这样一个镜头是很能启发人深思的吧！无论庙道会也好，保守党也好；无论龙泉剑也好，美式帽也好；更无论蒋介石、日本或美国，没有一个救得了他。孙殿英之流的时代已经过去了，旧中国社会一切混世魔王和大怪物，都将一扫而光。一个新的中国就要出现了。（附图片）
