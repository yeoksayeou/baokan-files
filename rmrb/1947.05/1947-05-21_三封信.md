　　Three Letters
    Niu Ziru
    One, Guo Kairong Tops the List of Successful Candidates
    On the front lines of the People's Self-Defense War, millions of letters are sent to the rear every day. In early March of this year, a post office on the JiluYu front received a batch of large red envelopes. The envelopes were addressed to the recipients and had the words "Merit Commendation" written in the upper left corner of the front. Among these large red "Merit Commendation Letters," some went from JiluYu, through Ji'nan, to Taihang, and then dispersed. A few reached Changzhi, and one fell into the hands of the cadres of the North-South Tianhe Village. When opened, the letter read:
    "To the Village Chief and all Village Cadres:
    Comrade Guo Kairong of your village has repeatedly performed meritorious deeds in the patriotic self-defense war to oppose Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous civil war and defend his hometown and his own fruits of liberation. He personally participated in the five major battles on the JiluYu front to recover Juye, Jiaxiang, Jinxiang, Chengwu, and other cities, and to eliminate fourteen brigades of Chiang's troops. Especially in the battle to capture Zhang Lanfeng in Wangquan, he bravely charged and seized a heavy machine gun, transported back many bullets, and won the title of 'Hero in Killing the Enemy' for the entire company, receiving first-class merit.
    Comrade Guo Kairong is loyal and has rendered meritorious service to the people, receiving commendation from higher authorities and being publicized in newspapers. This is not only an honor for Comrade Guo Kairong but also for your entire village. We are now writing to report the merit and request that you inform his family. With respect!
    Merit Committee of a certain regiment
    March 2nd"
    The village chief ran throughout the village with the red "Merit Commendation":
    "This is a great event for the whole village! Guo Kairong has topped the list!"
    "Guo Kairong has topped the list!" In an instant, the whole village knew.
    Two, It Is Most Glorious to Render Meritorious Service to the People
    Millions of letters are also sent from the rear to the front lines every day. One letter was addressed to "Hero Guo Kairong, 6th Company, a certain regiment, People's Liberation Army, JiluYu Front." The envelope was made from the cover of a "Struggle Household" ledger. This letter came down from the Taihang Mountains, crossed the Wei River, and was delivered to the JiluYu Plain. The recipient had already set off. After the unit of Hero Guo Kairong annihilated Chiang's Rapid Column (49th Brigade) and captured Brigade Commander Li Shouzhen alive, this letter was sent back from JiluYu to Taihang. In the besieged old nest of Sun Dianying—the suburbs of Tangyin city—the company commander received a letter that had been sent a month earlier, which read:
    "To the Company Commander and Political Instructor, forwarding to Hero Guo Kairong:
    After receiving your letter and learning that Comrade Guo Kairong of our village has rendered great service to the people, we specially erected a colorful platform on the west bank of North Tianhe on March 13th to hold a grand celebration meeting. The couplets on the platform pillars read: 'The front line reports merit, Guo Kairong digs up old roots and becomes a hero; the rear celebrates merit, young people lift the flagstones and want to learn from Kairong.' The meeting was held in the morning, attended by more than 600 people, and important officials from the county and district were also sent to congratulate with merit commendations and couplets. The village presented a glass plaque with the words 'Bravely Kill the Enemy' and a silk banner with the words 'Hero in Killing the Enemy,' and also sent Guo Kairong's wife a set of glorious clothing and a large red flower. In the midst of the stilt walkers, music, and Su Dian students singing Yangko and newly composed songs like 'Guo Kairong's Melody of Killing the Enemy' in North and South Tianhe, the whole village held a celebration meeting. Kairong's wife said on the stage: 'I will work hard in the rear, produce well, and strive to be a textile hero and a model cadre' (Kairong's wife is currently the secretary of the village women's salvation association). When the letter from the front was read out on the stage, all the men, women, old and young in the village were overjoyed, and everyone praised Kairong for bringing honor to our village. Then, the liberated hero Cao Linshui and comrades from the administrative office took the stage to speak, calling on everyone to learn from Kairong. Wang Liuze, a model militiaman who had only been married for two days, and young militiaman Guo Chunxing immediately jumped onto the stage to sign up for the army. Finally, the whole team lined up to hang plaques and paste couplets at Guo Kairong's door, make merry, set off firecrackers, and men, women, old and young congratulated Guo Kairong's family until the sun went down. Kairong's family is doing very well now. Last year, they received five pieces of clothing, three pieces of utensils, 8,000 Jibi, and the land is cultivated by the village on their behalf. Please don't worry! With respect!
    All Cadres of North-South Tianhe Village
    March 18th"
    Three, A Letter from a Certain Brigade to the Cadres of North-South Tianhe Village
    "To all Cadres of North-South Tianhe Village:
    We were deeply moved after reading your letter to Hero Guo Kairong. This letter has spread throughout our brigade, and everyone has been inspired by the enthusiasm of the people brought by this letter. Your letter has educated the troops, making the cadres and soldiers more aware that "it is glorious to render meritorious service to the people"! We will not forget you, we remember Kairong's wife, and all the military families, the liberated hero Cao Linshui, the model militiaman Wang Liuze. We will never fail your expectations. We guarantee to you that we will use our best efforts to train, educate, and improve our soldiers (they are all your husbands, brothers, and sons) to make them strong, brave, and invincible people's soldiers. We are also determined to fight with greater victories, eliminate more enemies, as a gift to thank you. We want to make a greater contribution to the people!
    We salute you with the People's Liberation Salute!
    Political Department of a certain brigade
    April 28th"

　　三封信
    牛子孺
    一  郭开荣中了状元
    在人民自卫战争的前线上，每天有千万封信寄到后方。今年三月初，冀鲁豫前线一个邮局收到了一批大的红色信封，信封上写着收信人的住址和名字，正面左上角写着“立功喜报”四个字。这批大的红色“报功信”中，有一部分由冀鲁豫，经过冀南，到了太行，又分散了，有几封到了长治，有一封落到了南北天河村干部的手里，拆开一看，信内写的是：
    “村长及各位村干部同志：
    你村郭开荣同志为了反对蒋介石的卖国内战，保卫家乡，保卫自己的翻身果实，在爱国自卫战争中屡建奇功。在冀鲁豫前线作过五次大战，收复巨野、嘉祥、金乡、城武等城和消灭蒋军十四个旅的战斗中，他都亲身参加了。特别是在活捉张岚峰的王权战斗中，勇敢冲杀，夺回重机枪一挺，运回许多子弹，荣获全连杀敌英雄，记了头功。
    郭开荣同志忠心耿耿，为人民立功，受到了上级的表扬，并已登报传名。这不仅是郭开荣同志的光荣，而且也是你们全村的光荣。现特写信报功，请转告其家属。此致敬礼！
    某团立功委员会
    三月二日”
    村长拿着这封红色的“喜报”嚷遍了全村：
    “这是全村的喜事！郭开荣中状元了！”
    “郭开荣中状元了！”一霎眼，全村都知道了。
    二  为人民立功最光荣
    每天又有千万封信由后方寄到前线。有一封是寄到“冀鲁豫前线人民解放军某部某团六连转杀敌英雄郭开荣收”，信封是用“斗争户”的账本皮糊的。这封信下了太行山，渡过了卫河，送到了冀鲁豫平原，收信的人已经出发了。杀敌英雄郭开荣所在部队歼灭了蒋家的快速纵队（四十九旅），活捉旅长李守正之后，这封信又由冀鲁豫寄回太行，在被围困的孙殿英的老窝——汤阴城郊，连长收到了一个月以前发出来的信，写的是：
    “连长、指导员同志转郭开荣杀敌英雄：
    接到你们来信后，知道我村郭开荣同志为人民立了大功，我们特于三月十三日在北天河西岸高搭彩台，隆重举行庆功大会。台柱上对联写的是：“前线报功、郭开荣刨老根成了英雄；后方庆功，青壮年掀石板要学开荣。”上午开会，到会群众六百余人，县区还派有要员携带喜报和对联前来庆贺。村中献了“勇敢杀敌”的玻璃大匾一块，和“杀敌英雄”锦帐一幅，还给开荣妻送了一套光荣衣和一朵大红花。在南北天河的男女高跷、音乐和苏店学生唱秧歌和新编的《郭开荣杀敌花腔》等歌声中，开了全村群众的庆功大会。开荣妻在台上说：“我要在后方努力工作，好好生产，争取当个纺织英雄和模范干部（开荣妻现为村妇救会秘书）。当台上宣读前方来信后，全村男女老少喜形于色，大家纷纷议论，对开荣为咱村争光称赞不已。接着翻身英雄曹林水和行署的同志都上台讲话号召大家向开荣学习。才结婚两天的模范民兵王六则和青年民兵郭春兴当场就跳到台上报名参军。最后全体整队到郭开荣的门口挂大匾贴对联、闹娱乐、放火炮，男女老幼向开荣家道喜，一直闹到太阳落地才散了会。现在开荣家很好，去年分了五件衣服，用具三件，冀钞八千元，土地由村上代耕，请勿念！此致敬礼！
    南北天河村全体干部启
    三月十八日”
    三  某旅给南北天河村干部的信
    “南北天河村全体干部：
    读了你们写给杀敌英雄郭开荣的信，我们非常感动。这封信传遍了我们全旅，每个人都被这封信所带来的人民的热情所鼓舞。你们的来信教育了部队，使干部和战士更明确了“为人民立功是光荣的”！我们不会忘记你们，我们记得开荣妻，和全体军属，翻身英雄曹林水，模范民兵王六则，我们决不辜负你们的热望，我们向你们保证，我们一定用最大的努力，来训练教育提高我们的战士，（他们都是你们的丈夫兄弟儿子）使他们成为坚强勇敢无敌的人民战士。我们也决心以更大的胜利战斗，更多的歼灭敌人，来作为感谢你们的礼物，我们要为人民立更大的功劳！
    向你们致以人民解放敬礼！
