Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi Front, 7th: The battle to annihilate the enemy on the periphery of Panlong began at dawn on the 3rd, amidst light rain and thin fog, and ended at 7:00 PM on the 4th, lasting a total of 41 hours of intense fighting. Hu Zongnan had constructed a formidable deep defense fortress complex at Panlong, surrounded by layers of barbed wire and outer trenches, and densely laid minefields, defended by his most elite 167th Brigade. He believed it to be an impregnable iron wall, and therefore stockpiled the supplies for his ten brigades here, confidently sending nine and a half brigades to invade Suide. Who knew that the People's Liberation Army, with unparalleled courage and excellent infantry-artillery coordination, would capture Panlong in one fell swoop. The entire directly subordinate unit of the 167th Brigade, the entire 459th Regiment, the entire Third Brigade of the "Shaanxi People's Self-Defense Force," and part of the Sixth Brigade were completely annihilated, with no one escaping.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi Front, 7th: The annihilation of the 167th Brigade (less one regiment) of the First Division of Jiang Hu's army in the Panlong area north of Yan'an on the 4th is the third great victory in the Northwest People's Liberation Army's self-defense war. It has been 20 days since the annihilation of Jiang Hu's 135th Brigade at Yangma River on April 14th, and only 40 days since the People's Armed Forces annihilated Jiang Hu's 31st Brigade at Qinghuabian on March 25th. This means that an average of one brigade of Jiang Hu's army is being eliminated every 20 days. And the enemy annihilated this time is the most elite direct line troops upon which Hu Zongnan built his career. The reorganized First Division (formerly a corps) has a total of three brigades (formerly divisions), namely the First Brigade, the 78th Brigade, and the 167th Brigade. The First Brigade was completely annihilated by General Chen Geng's People's Army Group in Fushan, Shanxi last autumn, and Brigade Commander Huang Zhengcheng was captured. The current First Division is a newly established formation, and its combat effectiveness is far inferior to before. After the 167th Brigade was annihilated this time, only one 78th Brigade remains of the "Number One Army in the World's" Reorganized First Division.

　　攻克蟠龙之战仅历四十小时
    【新华社陕北前线七日电】蟠龙外围歼灭战于三日晨光熹微之雨后薄雾中开始，至四日黄昏七时结束，共经过四十一小时的激烈战斗。胡宗南在蟠龙筑成了强大纵深堡垒群，并层层围以铁丝网及外壕，另加密布的地雷阵地，以最精锐的一六七旅防守，自以为铜墙铁壁，万无一失，故将其十个旅的补给物资囤积在这里，放心大胆地把九个半旅的兵力向绥德进犯。谁知人民解放军以无比英勇与美妙的步炮协同动作，一举攻下蟠龙。其一六七旅旅直属队全部，四五九团全部，与“陕西民众自卫总队”第三总队全部，及第六总队一部悉数被歼，无一漏网。
    【新华社陕北前线七日电】蒋胡军第一师一六七旅（缺一个团）四日在延安北蟠龙地区的就歼，是西北人民解放军自卫战争中的第三次大捷。距蒋胡军一三五旅于四月十四日羊马河就歼为时廿天，而距三月廿五日人民武装在青化砭歼灭蒋胡军卅一旅为时不过四十天。这就是说：平均每二十天消灭蒋胡军一个旅。而这次被歼灭的敌人，是胡宗南赖以起家的最精锐嫡系部队。按整编第一师（原军）共有三个旅（原师）即第一旅、七十八旅、一六七旅。第一旅已于去年秋在山西浮山，为陈赓将军人民兵团全部歼灭，旅长黄正成被俘，现在之第一师系新建制，战斗力远不如前。此次一六七旅被歼后，“天下第一军”的整一师，尚未被歼的只剩了一个七十八旅了。
