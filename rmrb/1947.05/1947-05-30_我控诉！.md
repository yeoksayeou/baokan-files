On April 18th, the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao reported that members of the China International Human Rights Guarantee Association, Liu Wang Liming, Sheng Pihua, Zhang Naiqi, Xu Guangping, Shen Tilin, Wu Yaozong, Geng Lixu, Bao Huier, Wen Youzhang, Zhang Manjun, Ma Shulun, and Wang Shao'ao, decided in a joint meeting of directors and secretaries to accept the appeal of Zhang Lianhua, who had disappeared, and publish her "I Accuse!" article in Chinese newspapers and the English-language *Millard's Review*, to expose the truth about the Kuomintang's fascist illegal arrest of innocent people. The original text of the accusation is as follows:

In front of compatriots across the country and righteous people around the world, I want to expose and accuse a crime – a crime of persecuting pure and innocent young people who repent and surrender. I urge the International Human Rights Guarantee Association to help us publicize this crime based on human justice.

This happened on the evening of March 5, 1947. I was teaching at the night school of the YWCA on McGegen Road when the gatekeeper announced that a visitor had arrived. A man I didn't know walked in, one hand in his trousers pocket, looking a little uneasy. He pointed at me and asked, "Are you Miss Zhang?" I said, "Yes." He said, "Someone outside wants to see you. Please come out."

I went out, but who knew that three strange men dragged and pushed me into a Xiang Sheng brand car and drove straight to some place.

Thus, inexplicably, I lost my freedom for seventeen days.

"What's your name?" a man asked. – God, he arrested people randomly before even figuring out their names. "My name is Zhang Lianhua!" I replied angrily.

"Do you have another name, Zhang Li?"

"I don't have another name at all."

"Do you know Zhang Li?" "I don't know!" I was getting a little angry.

Then he asked me what school I graduated from, what books I taught, what newspapers I read, and asked me to express my thoughts on the KMT-CPC issue and the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference. I told him that I didn't like current affairs and had nothing to say.

So he put on a tone of lecturing: "This is not good. Every man is responsible for the rise and fall of the country. How can you be so unconcerned about national affairs!"

He probably already knew he had arrested the wrong person, but he refused to let me go.

They押押 me to a moldy and smelly kitchen. I refused to go, crying,闹鬧,打打. They pushed me hard, and the door was locked.

That night, two other young ladies were locked in. I quickly learned that their names were Yang Yuan and Chen Huihe, both inexplicably deprived of their freedom.

The next night, around one o'clock, the door lock creaked, and a young lady in a leather coat walked in silently and chose a corner to sit down. She looked like another innocent victim. She introduced herself as Qiao Xiujuan. She was taken from her bed, and armed plainclothes officers from the Garrison Headquarters, along with her husband Yao Yongxiang, escorted her here.

It seemed like someone was eavesdropping outside. We could only look at each other and sympathize.

The third day was busy. From 8 pm to 10 pm, three more came – Lu Ying, Wu Xiuzhen, and Zhao Haizhu. Miss Lu had been beaten. She fainted on the ground and cried as soon as she came in and didn't want to eat. The other two were weeping in grief and indignation.

Around eleven o'clock, an order came, asking us to go upstairs one by one for questioning. The one who questioned me was a woman who claimed to be a Communist Party member before, but later changed. At first, I didn't understand why she expressed this to me. Later, I understood: she thought I was a Communist Party member, so she encouraged me to change like her, and after the change, she was willing to release me legally.

"I told you, I am not Zhang Li, I am not a Communist, I have nothing to change!" I shouted loudly. She quickly comforted me, saying that if she really arrested the wrong person, she would definitely clear my name. I heard this kind of nonsense for several days in a row. On the evening of the eleventh, it was repeated again. A man named Huang Minggang took me upstairs and interrogated me in a friendly tone. After asking around, he still couldn't turn me into Zhang Li or a Communist. He then asked me to write a confession.

"What kind of confession should I write!" I asked in panic.

"Write that you were originally a Communist Party member, but now you deeply feel that the Communist Party is not in line with national conditions, and you have long wanted to withdraw, but you have no chance. Now, taking advantage of the withdrawal of the CCP representatives, you voluntarily surrender and are determined to correct your mistakes." The person surnamed Huang taught this way and said that if I was willing to write it, he would guarantee to send me home within five minutes.

Since I refused to write a confession, they handcuffed me and twenty-four other young men and women on the night of the Premier's death and escorted us to Suzhou.

In Suzhou, we were locked in a non-high, non-low Chinese-style house, said to be a special political prisoner reformatory, specially used to treat Communists.

Among the group of men was one named Zhuang Feng, said to be a young musician. He was also arrested on the fifth of that month. Their first sentence to him was: "Why do you call yourself Zhuang Feng?" Mr. Zhuang was a little stunned. Then they waved their fists and shouted at him: "Do you know that 'Feng' represents red, and red is the Communist Party!" After saying that, they slapped him twice in the face. In this way, Zhuang Feng became a Communist, and Communists must repent and surrender, so they forced him to write a confession and a letter of repentance. Similarly, everyone else had to write. If they didn't confess and didn't write, they would be subjected to electric shocks, tiger benches, and灌灌开, and they would also wrap a towel around their heads and twist them with chopsticks on both sides.

Among the men was one named Lu Zhiying, said to be a doctor, who was tortured so badly by them with various cruel tortures that it was feared that he would not survive.

On March 18, one named Li Gengsheng forced me to write a detailed confession and told me that my family was looking for me everywhere. If I wanted to go back, I had to write a confession. He picked up a pen and wrote a statement of withdrawal from the CCP on my behalf, and then on the afternoon of the 21st, he put me on a special express train and sent me back to Shanghai alone.

### 我控诉！

　　我控诉！
    四月十八日沪大公报载中国国际人权保障会会员刘王立明，盛丕华、章乃器、许广平、沈体兰、吴耀宗、耿丽叙、鲍惠尔、文幼章、张曼筠、马叔伦、王绍鏊等于理事干事联合会中决定接受曾经失踪之张莲华之吁请，将其“我控诉”一文交各中文报及英文密勒氏评论报发表，以揭穿国民党法西斯非法逮捕无辜人民之真相，该控诉书原文如下：
    在全国同胞与全世界正义人士面前，我要揭露与控诉一件罪行——一件迫害纯洁无辜青年悔过自首的罪行，我吁请国际人权保障会本着人类的正义帮助我们把这件罪行公布出来。
    这是一九四七年三月五日傍晚的事，我正在麦根路女青年会夜校教书之际，门房老头儿通报有客来访，走出一个素不相识的男子，一只手插在长裤袋里，显得有些局促，另一只手指着我问：“你是张小姐吗？”我说“是的”他说：“外面有人看你，请你出去。”
    我走出去，谁知外面有三个陌生的汉子把我一拖一推，推进了一部祥生气车，直开往某处。
    这样莫明其妙的我便失去了十七天的自由。
    “你叫什么？”一个男人问着，——天啊，他连名字还未弄清楚就胡乱捉人。“我叫张莲华！”我愤愤的回答。
    “你是不是有个别名叫张莉？”
    “我根本没有第二个名字”。
    “你认得张莉吗？”“不认得！”我有点冒火。
    接着他问我在什么学校毕业，教的什么书，看的什么报纸，要我发表对国共问题与莫斯科外长会议的感想，我告诉他不喜欢时事，没有什么可发表。
    于是他摆出了一付教训的声调：“这样是不行的，国家兴亡匹夫有责，你对国家大事怎样可以这样不关心啊！”
    他大概已知道提错了人，但不肯放我出去。
    他们押我到一间又霉又臭的灶间里，我不肯去，哭着闹着打着，他们用力把我一推，门锁便被扣上了。
    当天晚上，还有两位小姐被关进来，很快的我知道他们叫杨瑗和陈惠和，都是莫明其妙地失去自由的。
    第二天晚上，一时左右，门锁呀呀作响，走进了一个穿皮大衣的小姐，默然拣了一个墙角坐下，看样子又是一个无辜者。他自我介绍说是乔秀娟，在被窝里给人拿了，警备司令部涌出的武装便衣连同他的丈夫姚永祥一起押送到这里来。
    外面似乎有人在偷听，我们只能相视而相怜。
    第三天可忙了，自下午八时至十时，一连来了三位——陆瑛、吴秀珍、赵海珠。陆小姐是被敲打过的，一进来就昏倒地上哭，饭不想吃。其余二人悲愤的泣不成声。
    十一时左右，命令来了，要我们一个一个提出二楼去询问。问我的是一个女的，开口自称她以前是个共产党员，后来转变了。我起初不明白为什么她这样对我表示，后来我明白了：原来她以为我是一个共产党员，因此以身作则的鼓励我跟她一样转变，转变后她愿意用法律来释放我。
    “我告诉过你们，我不是张莉，我不是共产党，我没有什么可以转变！”我大声喊道。她连忙安慰我说：假如是真的弄错了人，她一定替我洗雪。这种鬼话我一连听了几天，到十一日晚上，又重复了一次。一位叫黄名刚的男子，把我提到二楼，用友谊的口吻审问我，问来问去结果还是不能把我变成张莉，变为共产党，他便叫我写自首书。
    “写什么自首书！”我惊慌的问道。
    “写你本来是共产党，现在深感共产党不合国情，早想退出，苦无机会，现在趁中共代表撤退之后，自行投首，痛改前非。”姓黄的这样教着，并且说，假如肯写，五分钟内保送我回家。
    既然我不肯写自首书，他们在总理逝世这一天深夜，把我和其他二十四位男女青年给带上手拷，押送到苏州。
    在苏州，我们被关在一所不上不下的中式房子里，据说是特设的政治犯感化院，专用来对待共产党的。
    在男的一群里有一个叫庄枫，说是一个青年音乐家，他也是在五日那天被捉去的。他们第一句话问他：“你为什么要叫庄枫？”庄先生有点愕然，接着他们挥着拳头向他喊道：“你晓得枫代表红色，红色就是共产党！”说完迎头打了两个耳光，这样庄枫就变成了共产党，共产党一定要悔过自首，所以他们迫着他写自首书，写悔过书。同样其他的人都要写，如果不招不写，就得上电刑，上老虎凳，灌开水，而且还要用毛巾包着头部两边用筷子绞。
    男的里面有一位卢志英，听说是个医生，就给他们用各种酷刑折磨坏，恐难有生还希望。
    三月十八日有一位叫李耿生的逼我写一份详细的自首书，并且告诉我家里的人到处找我，如果我想回去就得写一份自首书。他拿起笔就代我写了一张脱离中共书，然后在二十一日下午坐了特快火车把我单独放回上海来。
