　　Seize the Time to Fight Drought and Rush Planting
The Dongyangguan Base Point in Licheng and its affiliated villages have organized a drought resistance committee to promote and lead the entire base point's drought resistance and rush planting efforts. This is an important measure in the current drought resistance work because:

　　First, carrying water for rush planting is an urgent and meticulous task. The slightest relaxation or carelessness will cause us to miss the opportunity. In order to achieve unified action, complete the work in a timely manner, and ensure that the seedlings emerge from the soil, we must concentrate our efforts to strengthen leadership, in order to avoid wasting manpower and doing things carelessly.

　　Second, drought resistance work is a relatively long-term endeavor. As the saying goes, "Guard against thieves every night, guard against drought every year." As long as the rain is not timely, it cannot be stopped. After planting, we must continue to dig wells and canals, and prepare early-maturing crop seeds, etc. This means that planting is only the first step in drought resistance work, and there are many things to be done next. These things also require organization and leadership, and the task of the drought resistance committee must run through the entire process.

　　Third, the drought resistance committee should be composed of cadres, labor heroes, and experienced old farmers. It plays a major role in absorbing mass opinions and guiding mass actions. It can exchange experiences in a timely manner, and promptly encourage the masses to organize themselves. It is the front-line headquarters for fighting natural disasters and the key to determining victory or defeat.

　　We hope that leading organs at all levels will deeply recognize the severity of the possible drought, respond to Chairman Yang's call, mobilize urgently, strengthen leadership at all levels, organize all the people who can be mobilized, concentrate our efforts to fight against the drought, and win a victory in production.

　　抓紧防旱抢种
    黎城东阳关基点与所属各村，组织防旱委员会，推动与领导全基点防旱抢种，这是目前防旱工作上重要措施。因为：
    一、担水抢种是一件紧急加细致的工作，稍一放松或马虎，就会错过时机，为取得行动一致及时完成，而且保证小苗出土，必须集中力量加强领导，以避免浪费民力及潦草从事的现象。
    二、防旱工作又是比较长期的工作，俗话说“夜夜防贼，年年防旱”。只要雨水失时，就不能停顿，点种之后，接着就要打井开渠，以及准备早熟作物种籽等等。这就是说，点种只是防旱工作中的第一步骤，紧接着还有许多事情要做。这些事情，还需要有组织有领导，防旱委员会的任务也就必须贯穿整个过程。
    三、防旱委员会应集中干部与劳英及有经验的老农而组成，它起着吸收群众意见、又指导群众行动的重大作用，它能及时交流经验，及时鼓励群众组织群众，它是和天灾作斗争的前线指挥部，它是决定胜负的关键。
    我们希望各级领导机关，深刻认识可能形成旱灾的严重性，响应杨主席的号召，紧急动员起来，加强各级领导，把所有能动员的人都组织起来，集中力量和天旱作斗争，在生产上打一个胜仗。
