(This report from Taiyue on the 28th) The Zhang Lai and Li Ming mutual aid group in Han Hong Village, Qinyuan County, practiced mutual aid and support, solving the production difficulties of newly emancipated households. They completed sowing 1,600 mu of land in a ten-day blitz. Before May, the village cadres thought that since the whole village had realized "land to the tiller" last year, there were no major difficulties. However, after deliberation by the mutual aid groups, it was discovered that 31 newly emancipated farmer households, including Liu Jinzhong and Zhao Tianyi, were completely empty-handed and had no way to carry out spring plowing. Therefore, the village production committee checked the degree of difficulty of each household and mobilized everyone to help each other and provide mutual support. (1) Lending grain for mutual assistance: For example, when Zhang Lai and Li Ming's group discussed mutual aid methods, Guo Taiping and Zuo Shouqiu immediately lent 3.8 shi of millet and 1.3 shi of corn to 24 newly emancipated households who had no food. In the Shengwang group, seven newly emancipated households had no way to manage, so they contracted 40,000 jin of firewood for the factory and prepaid 350,000 yuan, which would be used to offset the cost after spring plowing. (2) Mutual assistance in exchanging seeds: Zhang Lai's group lacked seeds, so the cooperative sold 4 shi of hemp seeds in exchange for the seeds they needed. Duan Zhuang, who had a surplus of grain and bean seeds, offered them to exchange with those who lacked them, thus completely solving the seed problem for the newly emancipated households. (3) Exchanging labor for cattle work: Each ox plowing one mu of land was exchanged for two units of labor. With the difficulties of the newly emancipated households resolved, the whole village quickly completed sowing.

　　沁源韩洪农民一家互助互济完成下种
    【本报太岳廿八日电】沁源韩洪村张来、李明互助组实行互助、互济，解决了新翻身户生产困难。十天内突击下种一千六百亩。五月以前，该村干部曾认为去年全村都实现了耕者有其田，没有甚困难了。经各互助小组酝酿后，却发现了刘金中、赵天义等三十一户新翻身农民底太空，春耕没有办法。于是村生产委员会就挨门按户的检查各户的困难程度，发动大家互助、互济。（一）借粮互助，如张来、李明小组内讨论互助办法时；郭太平、左守秋当即借出小米三石八斗，玉茭一石三斗给二十四家没吃的新翻身户。生旺组内有七户新翻身户没办法，便给工厂揽下四万斤柴，预支价款三十五万元，等春耕后顶补。（二）互助调换种籽，张来组内缺乏种籽，合作社便卖了四石麻籽换回他们所需要的种籽。段庄盛有富余的谷籽、豆籽就拿出来与缺乏的人交换，这样新翻身户种籽的困难便也全部解决了。（三）人工换牛工，每犋牛犁一亩地换人工两个，新翻身户的困难既已解决，全村便迅速完成下种。
