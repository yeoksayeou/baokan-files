　　I. Singing the Praises of Liberation

　　The people of Du Balian, having overthrown the cruel feudal oppression and exploitation, were liberated, received land, and lived a life of plenty, freedom, and democracy. People said with emotion, "We have grasped the lifeline. The old society was so hard on people that we sometimes didn't want to live. We never dreamed we would have today!" Zhang Ming said, "Without the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army, I would never have been liberated in a hundred years! In the past, my father was lured into smoking opium by the landlord Wei Sidao, incurred debts, and had his house and land taken away. My father died of hunger and opium addiction, still owing Wei's family five qian of opium. As a result, I worked as a hired laborer for his family for three years to pay off the debt. For more than thirty years, I never thought we would have today, with land, houses, food, and clothing. I will never forget the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army." In the past, everyone couldn't even afford to eat dark corn bread during the New Year. This year, even until the twentieth day of the first month, many families still had white steamed buns left over. In the past, there weren't enough vegetable leaves or elm leaves to eat in winter and spring, but now there are more sweet potatoes and radishes than they can eat.

　　People sang the praises of their liberation and struggle; during the New Year entertainment, they performed the heroic and magnificent "Fighting While Distributing Land" and many other moving stories of the liberation struggle. They fully demonstrated the creative genius of the masses, writing and performing their own stories, which were very realistic and vivid, making the people on and off the stage feel like they were really involved in the struggle again, becoming indignant because of the grievances and the invasion of the stubborn army, and then rejoicing and cheering because of the victory of the struggle. When you walk into each village, you will hear constant singing, singing about the past suffering and the present happiness. At the conference, men, women, old, and young, pulled each other, competing with each other to see who could sing the best. Especially the youth and women, the enthusiasm of not giving way to each other made the venue even more exciting and lively. The melodious and majestic singing often drifted throughout the village.

　　II. Everywhere is Full of Democracy

　　During the review, the feudal vestiges there have been cut off, and some undistributed fruits were thoroughly distributed to the farmers in need. In promoting democracy, the cadres sincerely asked the masses for their opinions and humbly accepted them. For example, the head of Liaowu Village was not democratic enough in the past, and this time he frankly conducted self-criticism. The masses also sincerely provided the cadres' advantages and disadvantages, thanking the cadres for their hard work in leading everyone to liberation, and re-elected the cadres according to the opinions of the masses. The vast majority of cadres have gained the support of the people from their actual work, and therefore have been re-elected. Then people put forward opposition to superstition, patriarchal autocracy, mothers-in-law scolding daughters-in-law, and men beating women, etc., "These are all feudal vestiges, and should be cut off." In Lianchi, people called the witch to confess: "Subduing gods is completely false. In the past, a child in ×'s family had a nervous breakdown and cut people with a knife. I asked him to be treated. I guessed that the child was not as strong as me, and he had been hungry for a few days, so I pretended to say: 'Borrowing divine power can subdue demons.' Divine power is big and the child's power is small, so naturally he can be subdued. In this way, everyone thinks my god is spiritual." Qu Hengyuan reviewed that it was wrong for him to scold his wife and said, "People are individuals, and we are also individuals. Besides, I am a few years older than my wife. Sometimes when something doesn't go my way, I scold her, which is wrong. I will definitely correct it in the future." A woman said, "My mother-in-law often scolds me, and says: 'I am responsible for beating you to death with a random stick, and I will break your legs if you go to visit relatives again.'" Then someone asked, "Is it right for a father to beat his son?" Some old people said, "Yes, strict discipline produces filial sons." The young people replied, "This is feudal talk. A father shouldn't beat his son, and filial piety is also forced." Someone else said, "Parents should also be democratically elected. Whoever leads well should be elected." After everyone's discussion, a democratic family system was implemented here, a democratic family meeting was held, and all feudal remnants were abolished.

　　III. Showing Great Skills on the Production Line

　　After liberation, the peasants' enthusiasm for production has greatly increased, they have established mutual aid teams, and they are producing vigorously. The people of Mazhu Village are close to the residence, voluntarily combined, and organized nine mutual aid teams. All full-labor and semi-labor people are organized into mutual aid teams, and even Chen Qinfang, an old farmer who has been liberated for more than seventy years, voluntarily wants to participate in the mutual aid team. This old man gets up the earliest in the morning and works very hard in the field. He sings operas with everyone during rest. After the village helped each other, Yang Liechuan, who had never worked, was brought up. This spring, except for the militiamen on duty, the people who measured the land, and the students, only seventy people in the village participated in labor, but because of the great strength of mutual assistance, all the five hundred acres of flower land and autumn land were plowed in twenty days; more than 1,400 acres of wheat were hoeed; and about 15,000 dan of manure was pulled to the ground. Everyone exclaimed, "Some wheat fields have never been hoeed before." "Without mutual assistance, the manure would not be sent to the fields by wheat day." In Dazhuang, the whole village built two canals this spring to irrigate the land.

　　Based on last year's experience, people felt that the mutual aid team did not calculate work and changed work, resulting in a muddled team. As a result, everyone felt unfair, the more active they became, the less energetic they became, and the more passive they took the opportunity to slack off. This year, Dongsan Village researched and produced an accurate calculation method for changing work and calculating work in mutual aid teams, and organized all men, women, old and young, full labor and semi-labor into it. In calculating work, a full labor worker works for ten points a day, four points in the morning, and three points each in the afternoon. For those with poorer labor or semi-labor, the work is calculated according to the size of his work performance. For example, if some old people hoe the ground, and young people harvest wheat, and they can top the full labor, they will be calculated according to the full labor, otherwise, everyone will calculate according to the work, so that the labor size in the mutual aid team will not suffer. Militia rotation warfare, usually supporting difference tops ten points, participating in the war and supporting difference eating their own tops twelve points. Men and women change work: women spin four taels of thread, weave one zhang of cloth, sew a pair of pants, each topping ten points of work, making a pair of shoes topping thirty points of work, and sewing a cloth shirt topping fifteen points of work. Full labor workers who do more work calculate daily wages differently according to busy and idle days: six catties of rice in winter and spring, three catties for meals, twenty catties for wheat harvesting and threshing days, fifteen catties for meals, twelve catties for busy days in autumn and summer, and eight catties for meals. Livestock are calculated the same as manual labor. Military cadres and martyrs' families are given as much preferential treatment as their families lack labor, and those who do not lack are not given preferential treatment, but they are not allowed to give others work. For widowers, widows, and orphans, in addition to changing work, those who can pay wages pay wages, and those who cannot afford to pay wages are treated as help work. Everyone agreed to this fair and reasonable method, and their enthusiasm was even higher. It is stipulated that students knock on the bell every day to go to work and underground, and rest twice every time. Everyone works happily and energetically. Recently, it has just rained, and the cotton and autumn land that should be planted have been planted in two or three days.

　　In order to increase labor, Du Balian also pays great attention to the reproduction and purchase of livestock. Now in Lianchi and other villages, there is an average of one livestock per two households, not counting some newborn small livestock. This year, the whole Du Balian proposed: to increase more than two hundred livestock, and to make one pig per family and one chicken per person.

　　In Lianchi and other villages, every household also held a democratic family meeting to draw up a whole-year family production plan. At a minimum, this year, we must ensure that income and expenditure are equal. Jiang Wanxi, the director of the Lianchi Farmers' Association, has fourteen people in his family. The annual food and clothing requires twenty-four dan of grain (including public grain, twenty-two catties per dou), seventy-two catties of salt, forty-six catties of oil, and fifty catties of cotton. His family has forty-seven acres of land. Although his children are all participating in work—the eldest child is the militia captain; the second child has already joined the army; the third child is the director of the Youth Salvation Association, producing at home when busy, and going to school when idle; and the fourth child is in school, helping out when busy. But they guarantee to do their work well and grow the land well. This year, they plan to plant 43 acres of land with grain, and a normal harvest can yield 25 dan; 4 acres of land will be planted with cotton and sesame, and more than 50 catties of cotton can be picked for clothing, and sesame and peanuts are enough to exchange for oil for eating and lighting; in addition to participating in agricultural labor, women will spin and weave eight cloths per person, and also raise a pig and a dozen chickens for the family to buy salt and other things. In this way, by doing a good job in both work and production, we can ensure that the family lives a life of plenty.

　　The people of Du Balian were liberated and are thus actively producing on the recovered land, living a free, prosperous, and happy life with sufficient food and clothing.

　　土地改革后
  　杜八联的新气象
    安畏
  　一、歌颂翻身
    杜八联的人民，打垮了残酷的封建压迫与剥削，翻了身，得到土地，过着饱暖自由民主的生活。人们感动地说着：“我们可抓住了活命根，旧社会把人逼得真难过，有时简直不想活了，做梦也没想到会有今天！”张明说：“没有共产党八路军，我一百年也翻不了身！过去父亲被地主卫思道引诱吸上大烟，背上债，把我的房屋土地都谋完后，父亲连气带饿和发烟瘾而死，还欠卫家五钱大烟土，结果我又给他家当雇工三年，才算还完债。三十多年来，就没想过咱还会有今日，有地有房，有吃有穿，我永远忘不了共产党八路军。”从前过年大家连黑馍都吃不上，今年到正月二十日，许多家白馍还没吃完。过去冬春天连菜叶榆树叶都不够吃，现在红薯萝卜都吃不完。
    人们歌颂着自己的翻身，战斗；在年关娱乐的时候，他们演出英勇雄壮的“一面打仗，一面分田”以及许多可歌可泣的翻身斗争的故事。他们充分表现出群众的创造天才，自己事，自己编，自己演，而演出的又非常真实生动，使台上台下的人，都像真的又卷入了斗争，随着剧情，时而因诉苦、顽军进犯而激愤，磨拳擦掌，继即因斗争胜利而欢欣鼓舞。当你走到每个村里时，就会听见不断的歌声，歌唱着已往的苦难和现在的愉快。在大会上，男的、女的、老的、少的，你拉我、我拉你，互相竞赛着谁唱的好，尤其青年和妇女，那种互不相让的热情，使会场更加兴奋和热烈，悠扬雄壮的歌声，不时飘荡到全村。
　  二、到处充满着民主
    复查时，那里封建尾巴已被割掉了，有些未分配完的果实，彻底地分配给需要的农民。在发扬民主中，干部诚恳地请群众提意见，并虚心接受。如蓼坞村长过去不够民主，这次自己就直率地进行了自我批评。群众也真诚的提供出干部的优缺点，感谢着干部领导大家翻身的辛苦，并根据群众意见改选了干部。绝大多数的干部，从实际工作中取得了人民的拥护，因而又被选任。接着人们提出反对迷信、独断专行的家长制、婆骂媳、男打女等，“这些都是封建尾巴呀，应该把它割掉。”在莲池，人们把巫人叫来坦白说：“下神完全是假的，从前×家小孩得了神经病，拿刀砍人，请我去治，我料这小孩没我力气大，又饿了几天，所以我就假说：‘借神力能够降妖，’神力大小孩力小，自然能降住，这样都认为我的神灵。”璩恒元检讨自己骂老婆不对说：“人家是个人，咱也是个人，再说我比我老婆还大几岁，有时候一点不随心，就骂人家，这就不对，以后我一定改正。”一个女人说：“婆婆经常骂我，并说：‘乱杆打死我负责，再走亲戚把腿打断’”接着有人提出：“老子打儿对不对？”有的老年人说：“对，棍头出孝子。”青年人回答说：“这就是封建话，棍头打儿不应该，孝顺也是被强迫。”还有人说：“家长也要民主选举，谁领导的好就选举谁。”经过大家讨论的结果，这里实行民主家庭制，召开了民主家庭会议，废除了一切封建残余。
  　三、生产线上大显身手
    翻身后的农民，生产情绪大大提高了，他们成立了互助组，生产得很起劲。马住村按住地邻近，自愿结合，组织起九个互助组。把全劳力半劳力都组织到互助组里，连七十多岁翻身老农民陈钦发都自愿要参加互助组。这老汉早晨起得最早，到地里干得很有劲。休息时他和大家一块唱戏。村里互助后把一贯不劳动的杨烈传都带了起来。今春除轮战民兵，及丈量地亩的人和学生外，村里只有七十人参加劳动，但由于互助起来力量大，二十天内就全部犁了花地和秋地五百多亩；锄麦一千四百多亩；拉去约一万五千担粪上了地。大家都惊讶地说：“过去有的麦地从来就没锄过。”“不是互助，到麦天粪也送不到地里。”在大庄全村今春修了两个渠灌溉土地。
    人们根据去年的经验，觉得互助组不计工变工，结果成为糊涂组，因而大家感到不公，积极的越干越没劲，消极的更乘机怠工。今年东三村研究出互助组变工计工的精确计算办法，把男女老少全劳力半劳力都组织进去，在计工上按一个全劳力作工一天顶十分，早晨顶四分，上下午各顶三分。劳力较差或半劳力的，都按他的工作成绩大小计工，如有的老年人锄地，青年人割麦，能够顶上全劳力的，就按全劳力计，否则就由大家按工计算，使互助组中的劳力大小，都不吃亏。民兵轮战，平时支差顶十分，参战支差吃自己的顶十二分。男女变工：女人纺四两线，织一丈布，缝一条裤，各顶十分工，做一双鞋顶三十分工，缝个布衫顶十五分工。作工多的全劳力，每天工资按闲忙天不同计算：冬春天六斤米，管吃则给三斤，麦天收麦打场二十斤，管吃给十五斤，秋夏忙天十二斤，管吃八斤，牲口与人工一样计算。对军干烈属，按其家庭缺多少劳力，就优待多少工，不缺者则不优待工，但亦不让给别人出工。对鳏寡孤独，除变工外，能出工资者出工资，出不起者，则作为帮工。大家都同意这种公平合理的办法，情绪更高起来了。劳作时规定每天学生敲钟上地下地，每晌休息二次，大家快活有劲地工作着，最近天刚下过雨，两三天内，就种完了棉花和应种的秋地。
    杜八联为了增加劳力，对牲口的繁殖与购买，亦很注意。现在莲地等村，平均两户有一个牲口，还不算新生的一些小牲口，今年全杜八联提出：要再增加二百个以上的牲口，并且作到一家喂一猪，一人养一鸡。
    在莲地等村，家家户户还召开家庭民主会议，订出全年家庭生产计划。最低限度，今年要保证收入与支出相等。莲地农会主任蒋万喜，家里十四口人，全年吃穿须要二十四石粮（包括缴公粮，每斗二十二斤），盐七十二斤，油四十六斤，棉花五十斤。他家有四十七亩地，虽然他的孩子都参加工作——大孩子当民兵队长；二孩早已参军；三儿为青救会主任，忙时在家生产，闲时到学校去读书；四儿在学校，忙时帮工。但他们保证把工作作好，还要把地种好，今年计划四十三亩地种粮，平收可得二十五石；四亩地种棉加芝麻，棉花能摘五十多斤够穿，芝麻和花生够换油吃和点灯；妇女除参加农业劳动外，每人纺织八个布，还要喂一个猪，和十几只鸡，作家庭买盐和其他之用，这样把工作生产都搞好，保证家庭能过着饱暖的生活。
    杜八联人民翻了身，就这样在收回的土地上积极生产，过着自由民生幸福、衣食充足的生活。
