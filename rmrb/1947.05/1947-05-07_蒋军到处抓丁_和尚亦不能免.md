　　Chiang's Troops Seize Recruits Everywhere
    Even Monks Are Not Exempt
    [Our newspaper, Yubei Front, 4th dispatch] According to the "Temporary Conscription Implementation Outline for the Longhai Railway and Areas North of It in the 35th Year of the Republic of China," recently seized from the Chiang-controlled Ministry of National Defense: In this year's county magistrate performance evaluation, conscription accounts for one-third of the total evaluation. Any delays will result in severe punishment for the division (regiment) garrison commander and the county magistrate. When conscripting in various townships, the Bao trưởng (ward chief), gentry, and "township representatives" must be present and affix their personal seals under the names and numbers of the conscripted men. They will be held responsible if the conscripted men escape. In addition to registering their name, date of birth, place of origin, address, and the names of their parents, brothers, and wives in detail, the conscripted men must also imprint fingerprints of all ten fingers to facilitate capture in case of escape.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 30th dispatch] Shanghai United Evening News reports: A large-scale conscription will be conducted in the Nanjing-Shanghai area. The military section of the Chiang-controlled Shanghai Municipal Government's Civil Affairs Bureau is rushing to print conscript background investigation forms, preparing to immediately begin conscription in the city. The first batch of conscripted men will be youths aged 20 to 25. It is estimated that there are about one million eligible young men of this age in the city. Suzhou is also actively preparing for conscription, causing widespread anxiety among all sectors. The local chamber of commerce, in a state of panic, sent a letter to the Chiang-controlled Senate requesting the Chiang government to postpone the process.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st dispatch] The Zhonghua Times reported on April 8th: The Chiang-controlled Ministry of National Defense has stipulated that monks cannot be exempted or deferred from military service. The Buddhist community in Nanjing believes that monks are compassionate, avoid killing, and practice frugality. Forcing monks to serve as soldiers would be a great shock to the Buddhist community. They have decided to jointly appeal and petition again with monks nationwide.
    [Our newspaper, Taiyue, 4th dispatch] Yan Xishan recently reorganized the village system into a "rural system" in areas such as Pingyao, consolidating three villages into one "rural area," abolishing the district level, and appointing the district chief as the rural chief. He incorporated most of the surplus personnel into his 44th Division and the newly established 14th Regiment, attempting to solve his difficulties in obtaining sufficient soldiers.

　　蒋军到处抓丁
    和尚亦不能免
    【本报豫北前线四日电】近据缴获之蒋记国防部所颁发“三十五年度陇海线及其以北地区临时征兵实施纲要”中规定：本年度县长考绩中，征兵部分占总考绩三分之一。如有延误，师（团）管区司令及县市长决予严惩。各乡镇征兵抽丁时，保长、士绅及“乡民代表”都要到场，并在被抽壮丁姓名号数下加盖私章，壮丁逃跑时，彼等都要负责。被抽壮丁除须详尽登记自己的姓名、出生年月、籍贯、住址及父母兄弟妻子姓名外，并须捺上十个指头的指纹，以便逃亡时便于捕捉。
    【新华社华中三十日电】沪联合晚报讯：京沪一带将大抽壮丁，现蒋记上海市府民政处军事科已在赶印壮丁身家调查单，准备立即着手在该市抽丁。首批调查之壮丁为二十至二十五岁之青年，预计该市在该项年龄以内之适龄壮丁约在百万人左右。苏州亦正积极筹备抽丁，各界惶惶不安，该地商会惊惶之余，函请蒋记参议会向蒋政府要求暂缓进行。
    【新华社陕北一日电】四月八日中华时报载：蒋记国防部已规定和尚不能免役或缓役。南京佛教界均认为出家人慈悲为怀，戒杀寡欲，若必定要和尚当兵，实予佛教界以极大刺激，现决定联合全国僧侣再次呼吁、请愿。
    【本报太岳四日电】阎锡山近在平遥等地改编村制为“乡村制”，以三个编村缩编为一“乡村”，取消区级，以区长担任乡长，将编余人员大部编入其四四师和新成立的一四团，企图借此解决其兵源不足困难。
