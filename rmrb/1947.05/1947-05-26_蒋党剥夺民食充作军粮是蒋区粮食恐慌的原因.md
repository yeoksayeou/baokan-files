Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, May 24th. A Shanghai newspaper commentary at the beginning of this month on the reasons for the food shortage in the Chiang-controlled areas stated: "One is the huge amount of military grain; the other is the continuous inflation of currency, coupled with the bureaucratic system and the prevalence of corruption, resulting in widespread panic." The commentary pointed out that the Chiang government has continued to implement requisitioning and borrowing since last autumn, and has also purchased large quantities of grain in rural areas. The Shanghai Grain General Warehouse alone stores more than one million shi of grain; Jiangxi also has more than 1.2 million shi of stored rice; and 2 million shi have been purchased in Sichuan Province. Recently, the Chiang government convened a national grain policy review meeting, which still decided to: (1) intensify the collection of land tax in kind; (2) purchase stored grain at discounted prices; and (3) control the stored grain in various provinces and counties… For military grain supply, they plan to purchase rice from abroad, while the annual demand for military grain is about 20 million shi. Under the tyrannical policies of requisitioning, borrowing, and searching by the Chiang "government," the bottom of the rice storage in rural areas is already empty. As Chiang's Hebei Provincial Food and Agriculture Director said: Hebei Province bears 120,000 bags of military grain every month, while the total stock of rice owned by Shanghai rice merchants is only about 100,000 shi. According to Chiang’s official sources, the Chiang government issues several hundred billion in currency every month, which is almost the total amount of bank deposits in the country. With more currency and less grain, it is no wonder that grain prices are soaring. The commentary further pointed out: "In the next three or four months, before the new rice comes on the market, rice prices will still experience a shocking surge." The commentary denounced the Chiang government's Ministry of Food and military grain institutions as "today's rice weevils in the public eye, the manufacturers of famine." The conclusion stated: "The civil war, on the one hand, spews out too much currency; on the other hand, it swallows a large amount of rice. This is already very clear."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, May 24th. Shanghai News: Although Chiang Kai-shek's printing presses are working day and night, it is still insufficient to supply the demand. The new banknotes ordered from abroad will take three to five months to arrive, which is too slow to alleviate the urgent need. Therefore, the Chiang Finance Department has recently purchased several banknote printing presses from the British London Mint, weighing a total of 700 tons, which arrived in Shanghai on the 8th. After being unloaded and installed by Chiang's Central Printing Factory, they can start work.

### 蒋党剥夺民食充作军粮是蒋区粮食恐慌的原因

　　蒋党剥夺民食充作军粮是蒋区粮食恐慌的原因
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】本月初沪报评论蒋管区粮慌原因称：“一为军粮数目浩大；一为通货不断膨胀，加以官僚制度，贪污风气，致造成全面恐慌。”评论指出：蒋政府自去秋继续施行征实征借，并且大量在农村收购，仅上海粮食总仓库即储有粮食一百多万石；在江西亦有储食米一百二十余万石；并在川省收购二百万石。最近蒋政府召开全国粮政检讨会，犹决定：（一）加紧摧缴产赋征实；（二）折价收买存粮，（三）管制各省县之存粮……………军粮供应则谋向国外购买食米，而军粮所需每年约在两千万石。在蒋“政府”征实征借搜购暴政下农村米粮存底已空，如蒋记河北省田粮处长谈称：河北省每月负担军粮达十二万包，而上海米商所有存粮亦不过十万石左右。据蒋家官方透露：蒋政府每月增发通货数千亿，几近全国银行存款总数，币多粮少，当然不怪粮价要猛涨了。评论又指出：“在未来三四月内，新米未登场前，米价还将有惊人暴涨。”评论指斥蒋政府之粮食部与军粮机构为“今天众目睽睽的大米蛀虫，是饥荒的制造者。”结论谓：“内战一方面吐出过多的通货；一方面吞进了大批的食米，这已是很明白的事情了。”
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】沪讯：虽然蒋介石的印钞机日夜开工，仍不足供应，外国定印之新钞为时需三五个月，已缓不济急，故最近蒋记财政部已自英国伦敦造币厂买来印钞机数部，总重七百吨，已于八日到沪，由蒋记中央印钞厂起货装妥后，即可开工。
