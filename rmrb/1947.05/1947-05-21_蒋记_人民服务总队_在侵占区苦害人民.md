　　Chiang's "People's Service Corps"
    Harasses the People in Occupied Areas
    [Report from the Yubei Front, May 15th] Li Guangxun, Yang Qingyu and other six members of the Sixth Group of the Seventh Detachment of Chiang's Ministry of National Defense "People's Service Corps," and 37 members of the "Intelligence Training Class," were all captured by reconnaissance personnel of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army in the west of Changyuan City. The "Pacification Political Work Manual" marked "Top Secret" and kept by the group was also seized. This manual was a sixteen-open-size Daolin paper edition, numbered Xinmi Geng 1521, and it was filled with a gloomy and murderous atmosphere. The "Administration Program for Pacification Areas" stipulated bloody fascist terror policies such as "People must be registered to households, households must be registered to Jia," "Issuance of national ID cards," "Establishment of secret rural police" and "Joint guarantee and joint liability." The "main executors" of these policies were the special agent lackeys of the "People's Service Corps." The captured Li Guangxun and others had all been trained in the "First Branch of the New Cadre Class of the Ministry of National Defense" in Qijiang, Sichuan, and went to Zhengzhou last winter to "work" in Fengqiu and Changyuan. According to Li Guangxun's letter to his friend Guo Liang, "The reason why I didn't work hard in the past few months is that I didn't want to ruin my compatriots. Now that I have embarked on this path, I have to climb slowly along this path." After being captured, he said: "We only earn 100,000 legal tender a month, which is only equivalent to a second lieutenant."

　　蒋记“人民服务总队”
    在侵占区苦害人民
    【本报豫北前线十五日电】蒋记国防部“人民服务队”第七中队第六组队员李光勋、杨庆余等六人，及“情报训练班”三十七人，前在长垣城西为解放军某部侦察员全部俘获。由该组保存标有“极机密”字样之“绥靖政工手册”亦被查获。此手册为十六开道林纸本，上书新密庚字第一五二一号，其中充满阴凄凄的杀气。在“绥靖区施政纲领”中规定，“人必归户，户必归甲”、“制发国民身份证”、“设立乡村秘密警察”“连保连坐”等血腥的法西斯恐怖政策。这政策的“主要执行者”就是“人民服务总队”的特务狗腿子们。被俘的李光勋等均曾在四川綦江“国防部新干班第一分班”受训，去冬到郑州，转赴封邱长垣“工作”，据李光勋给友人国梁之信上称：“过去几个月我没有努力工作的原因，是不愿糟害自己的同胞。现在既已走上了这条路只好顺着这条路慢慢爬啦。”被俘后就说：“我们一个月只赚十万法币，只相当于一个准尉吧了”。
