  　Wu'an Stretcher Team Achieves Merit at the Front
    [Our newspaper, Wu'an news] The second batch of stretcher teams from Wu'an arrived at their destination on the 9th. They accepted their mission that same day, and in just seven days, they completed the transfer of 298 wounded soldiers. During the transfer of the wounded, they proposed: "Comrades shed blood, we shed sweat; it's uneasy to mistreat benefactors. Compare them to ourselves; for whom are they shedding blood and sacrificing? Thinking before and thinking after, their pain is as if it were our own; the ten fingers are connected to the heart, moved in feeling and moved in heart."... Feeding soup, feeding water, buying whatever is needed, the stretcher teams generally manage to do it. Guo Shunxiang from the Second District carried a comrade with a severe back injury. When it was inconvenient for him to move when urinating, he spread very fine soil from the road onto the blanket of the stretcher bed, shaping it like a waterway, so that the wounded comrade could urinate without moving, and the urine would flow out along the channel. Then, with a flick of the soil, the blanket wouldn't get wet at all. To feed the wounded, they use a hollow tube (reed or wheat straw), with one end in the wounded person's mouth and the other end in a bowl of water, greatly reducing the difficulty for the wounded to drink water. The stretcher bed is improved every day, and now they have modified a detachable awning that can be disassembled at any time. Everything is prepared, and it can be set up in one minute, which everyone praises. Now, they have also launched an egg campaign, totaling about 10,000 eggs. In addition to focusing on caring for the wounded and completing their tasks, the stretcher teams also never forget to carry out work to love the people in the places where they are stationed. Qi Yuanxi from the Tenth District, a resident of Hucun, couldn't find a way to make a living, so he delivered water door-to-door in the morning, with the slogan: "Carrying water builds relationships, turning strangers into acquaintances." They cut their own firewood to burn, and in seven days, they cut 300,000 catties of firewood, which all the teams couldn't use up. Li Fangong and six others plowed more than six mu of land for the village chief. The village chief's elderly father kowtowed several times at the edge of the field, insisting on inviting them to eat, saying, "I've never experienced this in my life, I'll never forget the Eighth Route Army's kindness." Now that it's dry, they have proposed to help the masses carry water to plant cotton, launching a five-carry-water movement to strive to complete a 150,000-carry-water cotton planting campaign.

　　爱伤员如亲骨肉爱人民如亲兄弟
  　武安担架队前线立功
    【本报武安讯】武安第二批担架队，于九日到达目的地。当天就接受了任务，在短短的七天当中，完成了二百九十八个伤员的转运。在转运伤员中他们提出：“同志流血咱流汗，错待恩人心不安，将人家比自己，流血牺牲为了谁。前思思后想想，疼痛如在咱身上，十指连心，动情动心。”……喂汤喂水，吃啥买啥，担架队一般都能做到。二区郭顺祥抬着一个脊背受重伤的同志，小便时不便移动，他把道上很细的土，铺在担架床的被子上，铺成水道的样子，让伤员同志不动就能小便，尿水顺道流出，然后把土一打，被子一点也湿不了。喂伤员用一中空的小管（苇子或麦秆都可），一头放在伤员嘴里，一头放在水碗中，大大减少了伤员喝水的困难。担架床每天有新创造，现在改装了活动凉蓬，随时可以拆散，一切东西准备好，一分钟即可插起来，人人都赞扬。现在又发动一个鸡蛋运动，总数约为一万个。担架队除专心爱护伤员完成任务外，并时时不忘在驻地进行爱民工作。十区齐元喜胡村人，他找不到营生，早上便沿门送水，他口号是：“担水拉关系，生人变熟人。”他们自己割柴烧，七天时间，柴火割了三十万斤，各队柴火都用不了。李芳功等七人，给村长耕地六亩多，村长父亲老头子，到地边连磕几个响头，非请去让吃饭不行，他说：“活了这大没经过，八路军的恩典我忘不了。”现在天旱，他们提出帮助群众担水种棉，开展五担水运动，争取完成十五万担水种棉运动。
