　　Ten Thousand Farmers in Western Hebei Fully Support the Front Lines
    [Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] During the Shijiazhuang Outer Perimeter Campaign in mid-March, over ten thousand emancipated farmers from western Hebei actively participated in the war effort. In counties such as Yuanshi, Zanhuang, and Lincheng, tens of thousands of men and women milled flour and transported supplies day and night. The roads to the front lines were filled with the sounds of carts and a constant flow of people and horses. They all said, "If the comrades eat well and fight well, we can have a peaceful life and production," let's work harder! Students also mobilized to ensure they could study in peace. Elementary school students in Yuanshi villages competed to carry grain, and more than thirty teenagers from Gaoyi Senior Elementary School personally went to the front lines requesting to carry stretchers. Wang Yintang, a demobilized veteran from Nanzuo, enthusiastically signed up. More than seventy ironworkers from Xingtai city and county voluntarily formed an "Ironworker Team," carrying provisions and traveling a long distance to arrive. Several thousand people worked tirelessly all night along a forty-plus li railway line. Old Zhou, an ironworker, said, "Destroying roads and smashing railways is like smashing the tendons of Chiang Kai-shek, the old bastard! Let's all use our strength to break it." They highly demonstrated their intelligence in destroying the railways, creating a new method of stacking sleepers into several piles, placing the rails on top, and then setting fire to bend the rails, which was highly effective. At the same time, over ten thousand militiamen and self-defense forces, carrying guns and equipment, rushed to the front lines overnight. The militiamen cooperated with the main forces in combat, and the self-defense forces carried stretchers, etc. They were brave, resolute, highly enthusiastic, and displayed excellent camaraderie. In Fengjiazhuang and Macun in Zanhuang, the villagers used their spare change to buy eggs to comfort the wounded comrades. When a bullet landed near Guo Wenxiu's stretcher, he said, "It's okay! It's just a dud." Later, when the wooden pole was broken, they quickly dropped the pole and carried the wounded soldier to safety using their hands; When Ma Wenxiu and Han Dalu from Xiyangze, and four others, were transporting wounded soldiers, they went one station further than the originally scheduled station. When asked why, they all said, "This can get them to the hospital faster, so the comrades suffer less." On the battlefield, enemy planes strafed and bombed several times a day, and the stretcher-bearers bravely rushed the wounded soldiers into air-raid shelters, and then hid themselves. Once, when Guo Yangdongzhi and Liu Yuanlu from Xixing in Zanhuang, and others, were unable to hide in time, they quickly took off their cotton robes and covered the white quilts of the color guard to reduce the target and ensure safety, fully demonstrating the warmth of class friendship.
    During this participation in the war, the relationship between the army and the people was extremely harmonious, truly achieving mutual care and assistance. Therefore, the stretcher team was praised by the friendly neighboring Jin-Cha-Ji People's Liberation Army and presented with eggs, food, letters of appreciation, and a red award flag of "Model Stretcher-Bearers." When the troops transferred, both sides were reluctant to part.

　　冀西十万农民全力支援前线
    【本报特讯】三月中旬石门外围战役中，冀西十余万翻身农民纷纷参战。元氏、赞皇、临城等县，数万男女日夜磨面、运输，运往前线、路上整日车声隆隆人马川流不息，都说：“同志们吃好饭、打好仗，咱才能安生生产”，加紧干吧！学生为了能稳当上学，也动员起来。元氏各村小学生争着背粮，高邑高级小学校三十多个十几岁的同学，亲自找到前线要求抬担架。南佐荣退军人王印堂奋勇报名。邢台市、县铁工七十余人，自动组成“铁工队”携带给养远道赶来，数千人在四十余里铁路线上，整夜叮当不停。铁工老周说：“破路砸铁道，就是砸老蒋王八旦的筋哩！咱们都使劲把它砸断。”他们在破铁道中，高度发挥了智慧，创造把枕木垒起数堆，铁轨放上，然后点火把铁轨烧弯的新办法，效力极大。与此同时，民兵自卫队万余人持枪携具连夜奔赴前线，民兵配合主力作战，自卫队抬担架等，他们英勇果敢，热情极高，友爱精神极好。赞皇冯家庄、马村等地，老乡把自己带的零化钱，买成鸡蛋慰劳负伤同志，当子弹射到郭文修的担架跟前时，他说：“没事！这是飞子。”后来木杠被打断了，他们很快扔下杠子，用手抬着伤员安全走下火线；西阳泽马文秀、韩大路等六个人转运伤员时，隔过原定站多送了一站，别人问为什么这样？他们齐声说：“这能更快点送到医院，使同志少受点苦。”在战场上敌机每天数次扫射投弹，担架队员都奋勇将伤员抢送进防空洞，然后自己钻进隐藏，有一次赞皇西刑郭杨冬至、刘元禄等躲藏不及，忙将身上棉袍脱下掩盖在彩号的白被子上，减少了目标保障了安全，充分表现出阶级友爱的热情。
    此次参战中，军民关系极为融洽，真正作到互相关照帮助，因此担架队得到友邻晋察冀人民解放军的赞扬，并赠予鸡蛋食物，慰问信件及“担架模范”的红色奖旗，致部队转移时双方犹恋恋不舍。
