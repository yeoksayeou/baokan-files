　　Success Comes from Perseverance
    Summary of Individual Production by the Supply Department of the 38th Army
    [Our Newspaper's Report] The Supply Department of the Northwest Democratic Allied Army's 38th Army is a newly established unit. Under conditions of personnel shortage and limited funding, in order to overcome financial difficulties, establish a revolutionary household, and improve their own lives, from the top leaders to every odd-job worker, all actively participated in the production movement. To date, in one and a half months, a total of 1,616 catties of tofu have been ground, generating a profit of 46,632 yuan; 830 catties of bean sprouts have been grown, generating a profit of 16,527 yuan; and 3,800 yuan in silver dollars have been earned for carrying bricks for the factory; the total profit above is 66,150 yuan in silver dollars. Two and a half mu of vegetable gardens have been planted, yielding 1,500 catties of spinach and 120 catties of leeks. On average, per person, this has completed 40 percent of the task.
    Summarizing this period of production, there are three points of experience: First, cadres set an example (such as grinding tofu) to promote the development of the movement. (2) Timely solve everyone's ideological concerns: Some people think that planting vegetable gardens is a waste of effort, and if there is action, wouldn't it be wasted? At this time, the leadership quickly proposed to everyone the issues of increasing social wealth, reducing the burden on the people, exercising mass concepts, and increasing physical labor. After discussion, everyone's enthusiasm quickly improved. (3) The leadership must support and control this movement. For example, when the production movement entered its third week, everyone's enthusiasm seemed to be somewhat low. At this time, the leadership conducted education based on the current situation, requiring everyone not to be complacent, continue to persevere, and improve everyone's enthusiasm again.

　　坚持下去就有成绩
    三十八军供给部总结个人生产
    【本报讯】西北民主联军三十八军供给部是一个新成立的单位，在人员缺乏、经费有限的情况下，为了克服财政困难，建立革命家务，改善自己的生活，上自首长，下至每个杂务人员，都积极的卷入了生产运动。迄今一个半月，共磨豆腐一千六百一十六斤，获利四万六千六百三十二元；生豆芽八百零三十斤，获利一万六千五百二十七元；给工厂抬砖获洋三千八百元；以上共获洋六万六千一百五十元。种菜园二亩半，收菠菜一千五百斤，韭菜一百二十斤。以上若按全体人数平均，已完成了任务百分之四十。
    总结这一段生产，有三点经验：一、干部以身作则（如磨豆腐）推动运动开展。（二）及时解决大家思想上的顾虑：有人认为种菜园是白出力，如有行动岂不是扔了。这时领导上就很快的向大家提出增加社会财富，减轻人民负担，锻炼群众观念，增加体力劳动等问题，经过讨论，大家的情绪就很快的提高了。（三）领导上要扶持与掌握这一运动，如生产运动进入第三周时，大家的情绪似乎有些低落，这时领导上便根据目前时局，进行教育，要求大家不要自满，继续坚持下去，把大家的情绪又提高了。
