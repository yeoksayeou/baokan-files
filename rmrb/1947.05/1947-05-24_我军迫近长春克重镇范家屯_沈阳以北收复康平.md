    Our Army Closes in on Changchun, Captures Key Town of Fanjiatun
    Recovers Kangping North of Shenyang
    Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 22nd – The Northeast Democratic Allied Army captured Fanjiatun Station, a key town on the Chang (chun) - Si (ping) section of the Middle-Chang Railway (40 li southwest of Changchun), at 10:00 AM on the 20th. More than 30 wounded soldiers from the enemy's 71st Army were found abandoned. The Democratic Allied Army comforted and treated them one by one, and the wounded prisoners were moved to tears with gratitude.

    Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 21st – A unit of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army once again recovered Kangping (between Shenyang and Zhengjiatun) on the 17th. The defending enemy fled and was pursued and annihilated in part by our forces.

    Xinhua News Agency, West Manchuria, 22nd – From the start of the attack at 7:00 PM on the 17th to 11:00 AM on the 18th, the enemy who stubbornly resisted in the last two temples in the town of Huaide was finally eliminated. The outer courtyard of "Juchang Company" was filled with people, horses, guns, and fancy jeeps. The jeeps were fully loaded with American-made rifles and bullets. The American goods that had just been used by the reactionary army to fire on the Democratic Allied Army, now, along with these small and exquisite jeeps, have become the spoils of victory for the People's Army. The prisoners lined up, obediently listening to the commands of our soldiers. The boat-shaped American military caps, paired with those short, thin, tight-cuffed military uniforms, easily made people wonder if this was not the Chinese army. Next to a jeep on the west side of the courtyard, Xiang Dianyuan, the regimental commander of the Chiang army's 90th Regiment, lay like a corpse. His face was sallow, his hair disheveled, his hat was lost, the buttons of his jacket were undone, and his pants and the ground beneath him were stained with blood; he was pretending to be dead. When we recognized him, we all pushed him and told him not to play dead, and explained the Democratic Allied Army's policy on prisoners of war. At first, he was afraid to open his eyes, just shaking his head. When the stretcher team carried him onto the stretcher, his eyes suddenly brightened and he perked up a lot; he knew his life was safe. The driver wearing the boat-shaped hat started the jeep. Five jeeps, fully loaded with Democratic Allied Army soldiers and their spoils of victory, sped through the streets, followed by huge artillery vehicles, anti-tank guns, and a large number of prisoners, all coming out of the courtyard. Left in the courtyard were only dozens of corpses of Chiang's soldiers, and a symbol made of white cloth, sewn together to beg for help from the planes, which covered almost half of the courtyard. The planes helplessly circled in the sky, the battle was already over. (Lin Nianxi)

　　我军迫近长春克重镇范家屯
    沈阳以北收复康平
    【新华社东北前线二十二日电】东北民主联军于二十日上午十时，攻占中长路长（春）四（平）段之重镇范家屯车站（长春西南四十里）。发现敌遗弃之七十一军伤兵三十余人，民主联军一一予以抚慰治疗，伤俘无不感激涕零。
    【新华社东北前线二十一日电】东北民主联军一部，于十七日再度收复康平（沈阳与郑家屯之间），守敌逃遁，被我追歼一部。
    【新华社西满二十二日电】从十七日晚七时开始攻击到十八日晨十一时，在怀德镇里退守最后两座庙里顽抗着的敌人，终于被解决了。在“聚昌号”的外院子里，挤满人、马、枪和漂亮的小吉普车。吉普车上满装着美制的步枪和子弹。刚才还在反动军手里向民主联军开火的美国货，如今同这小巧玲珑的吉普车一起成了人民军队的胜利品。俘虏们排着队，顺从的听着我们战士的指挥。船形的美国军帽，配着那一身短而瘦紧扎着袖口的军衣，很容易使人疑惑这不是中国军队。在院子西面一辆吉普车旁边，死尸一样的躺着蒋军九十团团长项殿元，他的面孔腊黄，头松散乱，帽子已经失落，上衣的扣子解开，裤子上和身底下都染了血，在装着死。当我们认出了他以后，都推着他叫他不要装死，并解释民主联军的俘虏政策。他起初怕睁开眼，只是摇手，当他被担架队抬上抬床时，突然眼睛发亮，精神好了许多，他知道生命已经安全了。戴着船形帽的司机，开动了吉普车，五辆吉普车上满载着民主联军战士和他们的胜利品，驰过街道，接着庞大的炮车，战防炮和大批的俘虏，都从院子里出来了。在院子里留下的，只有几十个蒋军士兵尸体，和一个差不多铺了半个院子、用白布缝成向飞机乞援的符号。飞机无奈何的在天空旋转，战斗已经解决了。（林念奚）
