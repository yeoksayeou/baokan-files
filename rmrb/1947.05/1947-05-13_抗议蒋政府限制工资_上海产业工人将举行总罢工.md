Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th – According to an Associated Press dispatch from Shanghai on the 10th: The Federation of Industrial and Public Utility Workers, with 800,000 members, has submitted an open letter to the Chiang government's Shanghai Municipal Government stating that unless the Chiang government unfreezes workers' wages before May 12, it will hold a general strike, confiscate all rice savings, and take over all public facilities, thereby paralyzing all industries. The letter warned the Chiang government that any attempt to use force to suppress the strike would have serious consequences. Thousands of radio employees have already blocked radio traffic between Shanghai and home and abroad. The workers called the strike a "planned work organization," condemning "inadequate meals reducing our efficiency and ability"; they claimed, "The police are with us." According to a Central News Agency report on the 10th, telegraph and telephone communications between Shanghai and Nanjing have been disrupted due to a strike by telecommunications workers.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th – The Chiang government's "Economic Austerity Plan" stipulates freezing workers' wages at January levels. The Shanghai General Labor Union, the National Postal Workers' Union, the Shanghai Three Districts Department Store Union, and the Shanghai Four Districts Machinery Industry Workers' Union, among others, have successively voiced their opposition. In addition to petitioning the Chiang government in Nanjing, they issued declarations, held press conferences, and appealed to public opinion and society. The Four Districts Machinery Industry Workers' Union declaration questioned the Chiang government, saying: "This ruling method of freezing our wages, on which we depend for survival, is a fatal blow to us, tantamount to placing our families in a deadly situation. Everyone knows that the government has indeed lost the ability to control prices. So where is the basis for freezing the cost of living index?" The National Postal Workers' Union's urgent appeal stated: "The implementation of this rigid regulation will inevitably lead to workers' unrest, reduced work efficiency, and successive waves of labor unrest." Shanghai newspapers simultaneously published a chorus of calls for survival, with worker Zhang Yiming passionately saying: "Since the government ignores our survival, we should unite to protest; we will not give up until we achieve our goal." However, all petitions, declarations, and appeals were rejected by the Kuomintang authorities without result.

  　抗议蒋政府限制工资
    上海产业工人将举行总罢工
    【新华社陕北十一日电】据美联社十日上海电讯：拥有八十万会员之产业与公用事业工人联合会，已向蒋记上海市政府递交公开信称：除非蒋政府在五月十二日以前将工人工资解冻，否则即将举行总罢工，并将没收所有米的储蓄及接收一切公共设备，从而麻痹所有工业。该信警告蒋政府：如果企图使用武力镇压，将引起严重后果。数千无线电职工已阻止了上海与国内外之无线电交通。工人们称：罢工为“组织的工作计划”，他们谴责“三餐之不足，锐减了我们的效率与能力”；他们声称：“警察和我们站在一起。”另据中央社十日讯，上海南京间电报电话已因电信工人罢工而不通。
    【新华社陕北十一日电】蒋政府的“经济紧措方案”，规定冻结工人工资于一月份的水平上；上海市总工会、全国邮务总工会、上海市三区百货工会、上海四区机制业产业工会等，曾先后提出反对。他们除晋京向蒋政府请愿外，并发表宣言，招待记者，向舆论界及社会人士呼吁。四区机制业工会宣言中责问蒋政府说：“这种以统治方法来冻结我们借以为生的工资的指数，这是给我们致命的打击，不啻置我们一家老小于死地。人人都知道，政府现在确实失去了控制物价的能力。那么冻结生活指数的依据在那里呢？”全国邮务总会的紧急呼吁说：“这硬性的规定实施，可以想像：后果一定是职工生活不安，工作效率减低，工潮迭起。”上海报纸同时登载一片为要求活命的呼声，工人张一鸣激昂的说：“政府既不顾我们生死，我们应该一致起来抗议；一日不达目的，我们一日不甘休。”但所有请愿宣言呼吁，皆为国民党当局拒绝，毫无结果。
