　　New District Farmers Inspired by Wen Jie
　　Hongdong Extends Land Distribution to Plains
　　[Our Newspaper, Taiyue, 2nd Dispatch] The land reform movement in Hongdong, following the Jinan Victory, is fiercely advancing towards the enemy-occupied points and lines in the plains. Situated in an intense war environment, the farmers urgently demand land. Da Kong Village, only eight li away from the enemy stronghold, has repeatedly requested the district farmers' association to send cadres to resolve their land issues. Villagers from ×× village within the enemy's points and lines have also sent representatives to request the democratic government to preside over land reform. Our army's Jinan Victory has further inspired the local masses. They actively cooperated with the main force to repel the enemy at Dayang and Subao, and subsequently, the land reform movement quickly advanced to the Hongdong Plain. Currently, farmers in Da Kong Village have recovered over 200 mu of land, Cangdi has recovered over 80 mu, and Xizhang and Sunzhang have recovered over 200 mu. To expedite the resolution of land issues, the county headquarters has specially dispatched dozens of cadres from the old liberated areas to assist farmers in the new areas to stand up.
　　[Our Newspaper, Taiyue, 2nd Dispatch] The masses in Yuanyuan Village, Huo County, have completely dispelled their ideological concerns, and the land distribution movement continues to deepen, creating a model for implementing land reform during combat. After the village struggled against feudal forces like Wang Deyi, district and village cadres felt it was "almost done." However, after re-inspiring the masses to pour out their grievances, it was discovered that feudal figures like Guan Guixing had not been touched at all. Guan Guixing still owns more than two qing of land, living off high-rent exploitation. During the Red Army's Eastern Expedition twenty-five years ago, Guan Guixing falsely accused six poor peasants of being "communist bandits," leading to their arrest and execution by Yan Xishan. During the War of Resistance, he repeatedly led Japanese invaders to massacre the masses, committing countless evils. However, in several mass movements, the masses did not dare to mention his name because the village was only ten li away from the enemy stronghold. If news leaked out, the enemy would harass, kill, and rob. The leadership first worked to get through to the village farmers' association chairman, asking him to contact a few bold individuals to first monitor Guan Guixing, and then mobilize people one by one, encouraging them to pour out their grievances to him. The farmers' association chairman told everyone: "Guan Guixing's killings are not scary; what's scary is that we are not united." Then someone said: "The spies in our village are very bad, throwing stones at the houses where the militia live. I don't know what they're trying to do!" The farmers' association chairman seized on this sentence and asked everyone: "Who exactly are you talking about as spies?" At this time, the masses began to discuss it. It was as obvious as lice on a bald head; wasn't it Guan Guixing? Big spies cannot escape being big landlords. A certain militiaman had long been clamoring to struggle against Guan Guixing, but everyone was afraid. Now he mustered up his courage and said: "Knowing that Guan Guixing is a big landlord, why don't we dare to struggle against him?" After five or six days of brewing, the masses recognized their own strength, completely dispelled their concerns, and officially began to pour out their grievances against Guan Guixing on March 28th. On the 29th, the enemy came out to harass in three routes, one of which had reached Jinbi, only five li away from Yuanyuan. Gunfire was dense. The masses followed the wartime organization, pulling livestock, carrying clothes and belongings, and carrying children to transfer to the Mill Gully outside the village to continue pouring out their grievances and settling accounts. The militia put out three layers of sentries and sent capable militia to guard the trenches and positions in the west of the village to strike the enemy. The masses were still not at ease, and they also put out guards at the meeting place to prevent Guan Guixing from shouting to coordinate with the enemy. The gunfire grew closer and closer. The militia on the mountain shouted "Attention!" The old man Zhao Jiayun was so enraged that he could not restrain himself and continued to question Guan Guixing: "You killed my son and cut off my Zhao family line. What should be your punishment?" As he spoke, tears welled up in his eyes. The entire audience shed tears. Wang Sannv, an old lady of fifty, took the lead in raising her hand and shouting: "I have grievances!" She grabbed Guan Guixing and scolded: "Don't even think that Chiang Kai-shek will come to save you with guns and cannons. Bullets can't hit me. I must settle this debt with you!" The gunfire grew more and more intense. Bullets flew through the sky. The Jian River, less than three li away from the meeting place, had discovered the enemy, but it was drowned out by the voices of grievances of the entire audience. The masses were unmoved until sunset, when the enemy was repelled and the meeting ended. At night, each group sent people to join the militia to guard important intersections, strictly preventing enemy attacks, while continuing the struggle.

　　新区农民闻捷鼓舞
    洪洞分田推向平原
    【本报太岳二日电】洪洞土地改革运动，随着晋南大捷猛烈向平原敌占点线挺进。该地处于激烈的战争环境，农民迫切要求土地，仅离敌据点八里的大孔寨，几次要求区农会派干部给他们解决土地问题，敌人点线内之××村，亦派人前来要求民主政府主持土地改革。我军晋南大捷后，更鼓舞了当地群众。他们主动的配合主力军击退了大阳、苏堡之敌，接着土地改革运动遂很快推进到洪洞平原。目前大孔寨农民已收回土地二百余亩，沧底收回了八十余亩，西张、孙张收回二百余亩。县指挥部为使土地问题迅速解决，特抽调老区干部数十人，前往新区帮助农民翻身。
    【本报太岳二日电】霍县源头村群众彻底解除思想顾虑，分田运动继续深入，创造了在战斗中实行土地改革的范例，该村斗争了王德义等封建势力后，区村干部皆觉着“差不多”了，但重新启发群众诉苦后，又发现关桂兴等封建头子根本没有动过，关桂兴现在还拥有两顷多地，仗凭高租剥削生活。二十五年红军东征时，关桂兴曾诬害六个贫农“通匪”，被阎锡山捕杀了。抗战中又屡次带领日寇残杀群众，可谓无恶不作。但数次群运中，群众都不敢提出他的名字，原因是该村距敌据点仅十里，一走漏消息，敌人便出扰杀抢。领导上先打通该村农会主席思想，让他联络几个胆大的人，先监视住关桂兴，然后再一个一个人的动员，向其诉苦。农会主席向大家说：“关桂兴杀人不可怕，就怕咱们大家不团结。”接着有人说：“咱村特务坏得很，拿石头往民兵住的房子里扔，不知道想干什哩！”农会主席便抓住这句话反问大家：“你说的特务到底是谁呢？”此时群众皆纷纷议论起来，秃脑袋上爬虱子，事情就明摆着，还不是关桂兴？大特务就脱不了大地主。某民兵很早就嚷着要斗关桂兴，但大家不敢，这时他又鼓起劲说：“明知道关桂兴是大地主，为什么不敢斗争他呢？”经过五六天的酝酿，群众认识了自己的力量，彻底解除了顾虑，于三月二十八日开始正式向关桂兴诉苦。二十九日就有敌人分三路出扰，一路已至靳壁，距源头仅五里，枪声密集，群众便按着战时组织拉着牲口、担着衣物、抱着孩子转移到村外的磨沟里，继续诉苦清算，民兵放出了三层哨，并派得力民兵扼守村西战壕阵地，打击敌人。群众仍不放心，又在会场上放出警卫哨，以防关桂兴喊叫应合敌人。枪声越来越近，山上民兵已喊出“注意”，老汉赵加云怒火高烧，无法抑制，继续追问关桂兴：“你打死我儿，把我姓赵的绝了门，该当何罪？”说着眼泪夺眶而出，全场群众纷纷洒泪，五十岁的老太太王三女抢先举起手来高喊：“我有苦呀！”一把拉住关桂兴骂道：“你不要枉想蒋介石拿上枪炮来救你，子弹打不到我身上，这笔债非与你清算不行！”枪声一阵紧似一阵，子弹从天空飞过，距会场不及三里路的涧河已发现敌人，但是被全场的诉苦之声所掩没了；群众毫不动容，直至日落，敌人被击退，大会亦随之结束。夜间每个小组派人与民兵分头坚守重要路口，严防敌人袭击，一面继续斗争。
