[This Newspaper's Yubei Frontline News] Taixing Branch reporter reports: Tens of thousands of people participating in the war on the Yubei front widely launched the "Love the People" campaign, utilizing lulls in the war to help peasants liberate themselves and assist the masses in production, transforming stretcher teams into powerful liberation and production teams. At the beginning of the campaign, participating teams from various counties initiated discipline inspection movements, loudly proclaiming slogans such as "All people under heaven are one family, those who violate discipline must be inspected," and "Love the people, add merit upon merit." All instances of casually taking and using the people's belongings were compensated and apologized for, creating an atmosphere of everyone loving the people. The leadership in Wu'an, after resolving the participating masses' blind vengeful thoughts towards the people in the newly liberated areas, also saved food to relieve the disaster-stricken masses in the new areas. Subsequently, they further helped the masses with work, universally launching the "Full Water Vat" campaign. Gao Wu, seeing that the masses were using broken pots, mobilized six blacksmiths from Wu'an, including Zhou Chengzhang and Fei Deshan, to help the villagers nail together 52 pots of various sizes and 19 pieces of furniture such as washbasins within half a day at Niuheng Ridge, worth more than 30,000 yuan. When the villagers insisted on paying, they all refused, and the villagers were very grateful. The logistics command in western Lu seized Wu'an's experience and commended it in a timely manner. Following this, the counties of Lin, Hu, Ci, Ping, She, and Chang all promoted the thrift campaign, quickly saving more than 5,000 jin of rice to distribute to the masses. Various places successively helped the masses weed more than 2,600 mu of wheat, plow more than 300 mu of land, deliver 2,000 loads of fertilizer, and mend 700 pots. "Do whatever the masses need, do whatever you can do" has become the action slogan of the "Love the People" campaign. The stretcher teams in Lin County also launched an "Love the People" competition, vying to water gardens and plant melons for the villagers, carry night soil and repair land, and helped villagers cover 23 houses. The stretcher teams in She County specialized in weaving mats for the villagers, and doctors provided medical treatment to the villagers. All kinds of hardships left by the enemy in terms of the people's survival are now being overcome. The people everywhere are beaming with joy, telling each other: "Every village has a living Bodhisattva, our good times have arrived." After the "Love the People" campaign was launched in depth, it developed into mutual help and love. The masses in the newly liberated areas automatically helped the participating masses sew and mend clothes and wash cotton clothes. Many poor people poured out their innermost feelings and grievances to their own people. The stretcher teams in Wu'an and Ci Counties introduced the stories of the liberation of the old liberated areas, and universally launched the "Visit the Bitter and Talk About the Happy" campaign. Under this influence, the newly liberated villages in An, Tang, and Jun Counties ignited the flames of hatred against traitors and revenge. The stretcher team stationed in Liu Zhai Village in Jun County, under the slogan of "All poor people under heaven are one family, we should also help them," introduced the situation in the old liberated areas where each person received three mu of land and the burden of two seasons of taxation, which led the local masses to demand that they do the same quickly. The masses quickly exposed the crimes of the big traitor leader Hu Quanlu, Chief of Staff Wang Zhongyan, in the village. He forcibly occupied more than 600 mu of land alone, and the people in the surrounding villages were so oppressed that they could not survive. A long-term worker who had lived in his house for half his life, upon hearing that he could settle accounts, actively complained, demanding that he be given vent and repaid. So everyone started working together, dug open a cellar in the Wang family, and pulled out more than 200 bolts of foreign cloth, more than 300 pieces of clothing, and many pieces of furniture and food. Due to the influence of this struggle, many villages bordering Anyang took advantage of the lulls in the war to launch struggles. After some villages captured the returning corps and fleeing landlords from the front, everyone's enthusiasm for settling accounts and revenge became even greater.
　　On the Yubei battlefield, as our army fought forward, the participating masses organized the masses behind. While fighting at the front, the villages very close to the front line were stepping up their efforts to liberate themselves, produce, and support the front. The Ci County Command promptly summarized the initial liberation of the masses in the villages and helped them. On the one hand, it held meetings to continue the struggle, and on the other hand, it compiled the facts of the great local tyrant Dong Mufo into a clapper talk and sang it to the masses. It also selected 16 militiamen to form a temporary propaganda team, adapted the painful events of the village into a street drama, and in the evening, beating gongs and drums, and lighting torches, performed on the streets, which greatly encouraged the masses. Gui Shoujin, a participating model of the stretcher team in She County, discovered activists while organizing and mobilizing the masses in Qian Liujiang, Anyang, and cultivated them as village government cadres, so that the masses in the village all participated in the activities to support the war in an organized manner.

　　豫北前线参战群众
    战争空隙帮助翻身民爱民成普遍风气
    【本报豫北前线讯】太行分社记者报导：豫北前线参战的数万民众，广泛开展民爱民运动，利用战争空隙，扶助农民翻身，帮助群众生产，变担架队为强有力的翻身队和生产队。运动开始，各县参战队都发动纪律检查运动，响亮的提出：“天下人民是一家，犯纪律的要检查”、“要民爱民，功上加功”的口号。凡随便拿用群众的东西一律偿还和道歉，造成了大家爱民的风气。武安领导上在解决了参战群众对新区群众的盲目报复思想后，并节约粮食，救济受灾新区群众。接着又进一步帮助群众作活，普遍开展满缸运动。高五的见群众都是用的破锅，便动员武安的补铁匠周成章、费德善等六人，于牛横岭半天内就帮助老乡钉好大小锅五十二口，洗脸盆等家具十九件，计价达三万余元，群众非给钱不行，他们都拒绝了，群众十分感激。路西后勤指挥部抓紧了武安这个经验及时表扬，随着林、壶、磁、平、涉、长各县都推行了节约运动，很快便节约下五千多斤米分到群众手，各地先后帮助群众锄了两千六百多亩麦子，犁地三百余亩，送粪两千担，补锅七百口，“群众需要啥干啥，会干啥的干啥”已成为爱民运动的行动口号，林县担架还展开了爱民竞赛，争相为老乡浇园种瓜，担圊修地，并帮老乡铺盖了二十三间房子。涉县担架专为老乡编席子铺，医生给老乡看病。敌人在时留于人民生存方面的各种苦难，现在都被克服着，人民遍地喜笑颜开的在互相传告着：“村村有了活菩萨，咱好世道来了。”爱民运动深入开展后，便发展到互助互爱，新区群众自动帮参战群众缝补衣服，拆洗棉衣，许多穷苦人，都向自己人倾吐出心肝话倒开了苦水，武安、磁县担架队更介绍老解放区翻身的故事，普遍展开了“访苦谈喜”运动。安、汤、浚县新解放的村庄在这样影响下，点燃起反奸复仇的怒火。浚县刘砦村住的担架队，在“天下穷人是一家，咱也应该扶扶他”的口号下，从介绍老解放区每人分到三亩地，负担出两季等情形上，引的当地群众要求也赶快这样干，群众很快揭发出了该村大汉奸头子扈全禄参谋长王忠彦的罪恶，他一人强霸地六百多亩，周围各村人民被压迫的没法活，在他家住了半辈子长工的一个雇工听到能算帐，更是积极的诉苦，非要求给他出气还帐不行，于是大家齐动手，把王家一个地窑刨开，一下掏出二百多丈洋布，三百多件衣服，及家具粮食多件。这一斗争的影响，安阳交界的不少村子，乘战争空隙便展开了斗争，有些村子从前方捉回了还乡团和逃亡地主后，大家清算复仇的劲头更大了。
    在豫北战地，我们军队前边打过去，参战民众便在后边将群众组织起来，前边打仗，离火线很近的村子便在加紧进行翻身生产支援前线，磁县县指挥部及时在驻村帮助群众初步总结翻身后，一方面开会继续斗，一面便将东木佛大恶霸的事实编成快板，唱给群众听。并抽出十六个民兵组成临时宣传队，将本村痛苦事排成街头剧，到晚上，打着锣鼓，点着火把，到街上出演，给群众的鼓舞极大。涉县担架队的参战模范桂守金在安阳前流江从组织发动群众中，发现积极分子，便培养为村政干部，使该村群众都有组织的参加到支援战争的活动里。
