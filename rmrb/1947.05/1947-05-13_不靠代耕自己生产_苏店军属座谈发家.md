　　Not Relying on Substitute Farming, Military Dependents in Su Village Discuss Wealth Creation
    [This newspaper's Changzhi report] After production mobilization in Su Village, the masses were preparing to cultivate two-thirds of their land while setting aside one-third, but military dependents and retired veterans showed a lack of confidence and reliance on others. The mother of Erpang said, "We have no labor; it's fine as long as we grow enough to eat for a year, even if it's not perfect." Niu Huaisuo's mother said, "My son joined the army. My daughter-in-law and I will live off of what we have. Someone will take care of the planting and harvesting, so we don't have to worry." After discovering these thoughts, a forum was held on May 3rd with 92 military dependents and retired veterans, raising the question: "Is it right for military dependents and retired veterans to rely on others? Should they create wealth themselves, or rely on others to do it?" A 69-year-old woman said, "My son joined the army to protect us. We can't become like lords just because we're military dependents. Why should we rely on others to farm if we don't work ourselves? My family of three received 15,000 yuan worth of fruit. We put 8,000 yuan into the cooperative. That's enough for salt, coal, and lamp oil. The remaining 7,000 yuan can buy 10 and a half catties of cotton. Spinning it into thread makes a profit of one catty for every catty. That's enough to make clothes. My daughter-in-law can glean the fields, spread manure, carry water, and grind flour. We just need help with the bigger tasks. Eleven mu of land can yield sixteen shi of grain, more than enough to eat." Aunt Guoji said, "What this old woman said is right. The common people are now participating in the war effort, carrying stretchers, transporting supplies, and still doing substitute farming for us and for those participating in the war. They can't manage it all. What glory is there in being a military dependent and not moving a finger? If I'm not spinning cotton at home, I'm in the fields watering the garden. Whatever I can do, I'll do." Retired veteran Laoqi said, "I only have one arm. I'll join a mutual aid group. I can't do the big tasks, but I can do the small ones." Then five retired veterans all wanted to join mutual aid groups.

    In such a heated discussion, with everyone speaking their minds, five military dependents' families with labor decided not to use substitute farming. In the end, everyone reported the amount of work they needed substitute farming for, and the preferential treatment committee conducted mutual evaluations. Everyone said, "This way of substitute farming is both reasonable and fair." Everyone calculated that it would save a total of 730 workdays compared to last time. (Lin Tang, Han Qing, Xing Fu)

　　不靠代耕自己生产
    苏店军属座谈发家
    【本报长治讯】苏店经过生产动员，群众都酝酿着耕二余一，但军属、荣退军人，却表现无信心和依靠思想；二胖母亲说：“咱无劳力，种上够一年吃就不要嫌歪。”牛怀锁母亲说：“我儿参了军，婆媳二人坐吃坐穿几天吧，该种该收都有人照管，不会发愁。”发现这些思想后，五月三日召开军属、荣退军人九十二人座谈会，提出：“军属、荣退军人，依靠人对不对？是自己发家？还是依靠发家？”一位六十九岁的老婆说：“我儿参了军，是为了保护自己，咱当上军属也不能成了老爷，个人不劳动光靠人家代耕？我家三人分了果实洋一万五千元，合作社入了八千元，吃盐、烧煤、点油够了，下余七千元能买十斤半花，纺成线一斤赚一斤，赚上够穿了。媳妇到地里边搂茬子、撒粪、担水、碾面都能干了，有人帮帮大生活就行了，十一亩地能打十六石粮食，除吃还有余。”过计娘说：“这老婆说的都对，老百姓现在参战、担架、运输再给咱代耕，又给参战人代耕，顾不过来。”当上个军属不动弹，有什么光荣？我在家里不纺花就上地浇园，能干什么，就干什么。”荣退军人老七说：“我是个一根胳膊，参加互助组，干不了大生活，能干小生活。”接着有五个荣退军人，都要参加互助组。
    就在这样热烘烘的讨论研究中，你一言他一语，就有五户有劳力军属都不用代耕了。最后大家又把需代耕的工自报了一下，优军委员又进行了互相评议，大家都说：“这样代耕又合理又公道。”大家算了算，比上次共省工七百三十个。（林堂、汉清、行夫）
