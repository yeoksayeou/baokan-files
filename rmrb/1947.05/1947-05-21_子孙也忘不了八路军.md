　　“Descendants Will Never Forget the Eighth Route Army”
    Yì Xiào
    The houses in Beiguan, Tangyin, were burned to the ground two days before the enemy fled. The smoldering embers were still slowly burning, and the enemy's machine guns and artillery on the city wall continued to sweep and bombard the collapsed walls.
    Our ninth squad had been holding out on the west side of Beiguan for two days and a night. The entrenchments were about to reach the base of the city wall. When I looked up, I saw seven or eight old women huddled together in a roofless house in Beiguan. Every now and then, one or two would stand up and look around anxiously before quickly crouching back down.
    We were very surprised, never expecting that there would still be people in Beiguan. We all looked at them, but no one said a word. The enemy's artillery fire was tightly blocking the open space in front of us, which was only about ten steps wide. At that moment, I suddenly remembered the saying, "It is glorious to perform meritorious service for the people, even if it means shedding blood and sacrificing oneself." Seeing that the artillery fire was constantly hitting their area, they might be finished at any moment. If we didn't rescue them, who would? In a flash, without waiting for the squad leader's order, and without discussing it with the other comrades, I jumped out of the entrenchment and scrambled to the foot of the wall. Then I climbed over the low wall and jumped into the house.
    When they saw me, they hurriedly scurried to another corner of the room, trembling with fear. Two small children were held in their arms, crying as if they had seen someone about to kill them. Lying on the ground, amidst the piles of broken pots, rotten bowls, dung, grass, and broken tiles, was a weak old man, covered in dust from head to toe. A few sparse white whiskers hung from the corners of his mouth, and his white eyes were staring blankly at the sky. A middle-aged old woman, her hair like a tangled bird's nest, was covered with wheat stalks and firewood. Her narrow, thin, and yellow face was twisted in pain. With her hands, she was holding a bloody leg and shedding tears, her thin voice moaning softly. At that moment, my heart sank, and the hair on my body stood on end. I couldn't think of anything to say, so I just said to them, "Old ladies! Don't be afraid, we are the Eighth Route Army!"
    When they heard my words, the old man lying on the ground blinked his white eyes and looked at me. The old woman holding her bloody leg immediately burst into tears. The old women huddled in the corner quickly stood up one after another and said:
    "You are the Eighth Route Army?!" They said, half in doubt.
    "Yes," I replied.
    "We saw you yesterday, but we were afraid..."
    "We are the Eighth Route Army, here to save you!" I repeated to them.
    "We haven't had a drop of water or a grain of rice for three days!"
    "My old man has been sick for more than half a month." A bolder one said, moving closer to me and pointing to the old man lying on the ground.
    "I was...hit by a plane!" The woman with the bloody leg said, crying.
    At this time, some of them were standing, some were sitting, some were crying, and some were talking. It was truly pitiful! I was afraid the enemy would hear us and start shelling, so I told them to keep their voices down. I thought: it would be great if they could get to our entrenchments, but the road is so tightly blocked, how can we get them across? Finally, I made up my mind to crawl and carry them across one by one, saving as many as I could.
    "You wait here, I'll be back in a moment!" I said, squatting down and carrying the old man on my back. I quickly crawled back to the entrenchments. After putting the old man down, I didn't dare to stop, and I brought two more comrades back to the house. We had been digging entrenchments for two days, but even after carrying three people on our backs, we didn't feel tired. I don't know where the strength came from. When we were carrying the fourth one, the enemy on the city wall saw us, and the machine guns and artillery fired at us even more fiercely. At this time, the machine guns in our squad aimed at the gun holes on the city wall and returned fire. The "whoosh! whoosh!" of bullets flew over our heads one after another. The ground next to our bodies was like a hot pan of frying peanuts, with puffs of dust rising up. But we didn't stop carrying them. Finally, we managed to carry them all across.
    "The bundles are still in the house!" One of the old women suddenly remembered her bundles after sitting down.
    "Forget about them! It's good enough that we got out alive! Don't you see what kind of situation this is!" The other old women said in unison.
    "It doesn't matter, I'll go get them." Although they tried to stop me, I thought they must have lost something important that they couldn't bear to leave behind, so I braved the artillery fire and crawled back. Back in the ruined house, I saw a bundle containing a few new coarse cloth clothes, and two children's cotton-padded jackets lying on the ground. I picked them all up, stuffed them into the bundle, and as I was returning, the bundle was pierced by five or six holes.
    When I returned to the entrenchments, I saw all the comrades treating them like their own parents, happily handing them the food that had been sent from the rear first. The medical orderly from the company headquarters was applying medicine to the old woman's bloody leg. The instructor, the company commander, and the comrades from the other squads also crowded around to offer their condolences, filling the small entrenchment. When the old women saw me carrying the bundle back, they said many words of apology and also blamed the old woman for being too talkative and risking her life for these worthless things.
    "You are so good to us! When the southern troops left, they forced us to leave our homes, saying it was an order from above to burn all the houses. They also said that if we didn't leave, the bandits would kill us all. Look how hateful they are!"
    "They burned all our food and clothes!"
    "You are truly our saviors. If it weren't for you saving us, we wouldn't have made it through today. We would have either starved to death or been scared to death!"
    The more they talked, the more excited they became, and they talked endlessly. When the comrades asked them a question, they would stretch their necks and tell you a dozen sentences. The shells were constantly exploding outside the entrenchments, but they weren't afraid at all.
    After they had eaten and drunk their fill, we advised them to go to the village in the rear to take shelter temporarily. After a few days, when Tangyin City was taken, they could go back home to collect their belongings. The comrades warmly sent them off and said many comforting words to them.
    I carried their bundles on my back, led them to a main road at the entrance of the trench, and pointed them to the road to the rear. To make them feel more at ease, I said, "The road is full of our own troops. In the past two days, we have sent twenty or thirty villagers out of Beiguan through this road."
    As they were leaving, they looked at me and cried without saying a word. The old man pushed me with both hands: "Comrade! Go back and do your work! We won't die. We will never forget you. As long as our descendants are still alive, they will never forget the Eighth Route Army. When the city is taken, be sure to come to our house!"
    "Old ladies and gentlemen! The Eighth Route Army is for us poor people. When you are in trouble, we have to do this!" These were the last words I said to them.
    Back in the entrenchments, I was about to find a pickaxe to repair the dugout when the instructor came over and patted me on the shoulder, saying, "Comrade Zhang Dequan! You risked your life in the artillery fire to rescue the masses who were suffering on the battlefield. You have performed a great service for the people!" I smiled, but I didn't say a word, just thinking, in the collapsed houses of Beiguan, were there any other pitiful people like them?

　　“子孙也忘不了八路军”
    弋笑
    汤阴北关的房子，在敌人临跑的前两天就烧光了，半熄不灭的烟火还在不断的慢慢燃烧着，城上敌人的机枪大炮也仍在不住点的对着倒塌的墙头扫射轰击。
    我们九班在北关的西面，已经坚持了两天一夜，工事眼看要挖到城脚下了，猛一抬头，看见北关一间没了顶的房子里，有七八个老太婆挤在一块，不时有一两个站起来慌张的向四面看一下，马上又爬下去了。
    我们很奇怪，万想不到现在北关里还会有人。我们一个个看着她们，谁也没有说一句话。敌人的炮火，严密的封锁着前面那块十来步宽的开阔地。这时候我猛然想起了“为人民立功，流血牺牲也光荣”的话来，眼看着，炮火老向她们那一块打，说不定啥时候她们就完啦，我们不去救她们谁去救她们？一转念，我没等班长下命令，也没和别的同志商量，跳出工事，连滚带爬的到了墙跟前，于是翻过牛截墙，就跳到房子里。
    她们看见了我，就急急忙忙向另一个墙角里去躲，吓得直打哆嗦。有两个小孩子在怀里抱着，哭得像是看见有人要来杀他一样。在破盆烂碗、粪草瓦片堆得乱七八糟的地上，躺着一个有气无力的老汉，满身满脸尽是灰土，嘴角上稀稀的有几根白胡子，白瞪着两眼朝着天。一个中年老太婆，头发活似一窝乱麻，粘满了麦秸和柴火棒子，窄窄的小脸，又瘦又黄，裂着嘴，两只手抱着一条血腿在掉泪，尖尖的嗓子，低声的唉呀唉哟的叫唤着。这时候我的心崩的凉了一下，浑身汗毛都支沙起来了，我想不出说啥好，只对她们说：“老大娘们！不要怕，我们是八路军！”
    她们听了我的话，地上躺的那个老汉眨起白眼在看我；抱着血腿的老太婆立刻放声大哭起来；挤在墙角边的老太婆们一个跟一个很快站了起来说：
    “你是八路军？！”她们半信半疑地说。
    “是的。”我回答说。
    “昨天就看见你们啦，俺怕是……”
    “我们是来救你们的八路军！”我又重复对她们说了一句。
    “三天了，我们水米没打牙！”
    “俺大爷病害了半个多月了。”一个胆子较大的说着挪动到了我的跟前，还指了一下地上躺的那个老汉。
    “我是……飞机打住的呀！”抱血腿的女人边说边哭。
    这时，她们站的站，坐的坐，有的哭，有的说，真是可怜哪！我怕敌人听见了打炮，叫她们低声点。心想：她们能到我们工事里就好啦，但是路封的那样紧，怎么把她们弄过去呢？最后我下定决心，一个一个的爬着背过去，能救多少算多少。
    “你们等着，我一会就过来！”说着就蹲到地下，背上老汉，急急的爬回工事里，放下老汉没敢停，又带上两个同志滚到房子里。我们已经挖了两天工事了，可是一连背了三个也不感觉着累，不知道是从那里上来的劲。当我们背到第四个的时候，城上敌人看见了，机枪、大炮对着我们打的更凶了。这时，我们班的机枪就瞄准城上的枪眼向敌人还击。“咻！咻！”的子弹声一个接一个在头上飞过去，身子旁边的地面上，活像炒花生的热锅一般，尘土一股一股的向上冒，我们几个仍然不停止的背过她们，最后总算把她们全都背过来了。
    “包袱忘在房子里啦！”有一个老太婆坐下后，猛然想起了自己的包袱。
    “要那哩！人能过来就好啦！没看这是啥光景！”另外几个老太婆齐声说着。
    “不要紧，我去拿过来。”虽然他们拉着不让我去，但是我想人家一定是丢了好东西，舍不得，就又冒着炮火滚了过去。回到破房子里，只见一个包袱，包了几件新的粗布衣服，地下甩着两个小孩子棉袄，我都拾了起来，塞到包袱里，在往回返的时候，包袱上打穿了五六个窟窿。
    当我回到工事里，看见全班同志象对待自己家里父母一样，把后边送来的饭，高兴的先递给她们吃；连部卫生员正在给那个血腿老太婆上药；指导员连长和其他班的同志也都挤来慰问，把一条小小的工事塞满了。老太婆们看见我背着包袱回来时，七言八语，不知道说了多少不好意思的话，还埋怨那个老太婆太多嘴，不该为这些不值钱的东西去拿性命换回来。
    “你们多好呵！南边队伍临走赶俺离开家，说是上级命令，要把房子烧光，还说如果不走，土匪过来都活不成，您看可恨不可恨！”
    “粮食衣服，烧个光达达！”
    “你们真是俺的救命恩人，要不是你们搭救俺，今天就熬不过去了，不饿死也得吓死啦！”
    她们越说越起劲，说起来没有头，同志们问一句，她们就伸着脖子给你说十几句，炮弹在工事外面不断的爆炸着，她们竟是一点也不怕了。
    吃饱喝好以后，我们劝她们到后面村子暂时躲避躲避，过几天汤阴城打下了，再回家去收拾东西。同志们热烈的送着她们，还对她们说了不少的宽心话。
    我背着她们的包袱，把她们送出交通壕口的一条大路上，指给他们到后边去的道路，为了使她们更放心的走路，我说：“一路上净是咱自己的队伍，这两天我们已经从北关送出二三十个老乡，都是从这条路过去的。”
    临别了，她们对着我没说话就哭起来，那位老汉双手推着我：“同志！回去干你的吧！俺死不了，就忘不了您，子孙们只要还在的话，也永远忘不了八路军。城打开了，千万到俺家一趟呵。”
    “大娘大爷们！八路军就是为了咱们这些穷人，你们有了难，我们就得这样干！”这是我给她们说的最后一句话。
    回到工事里，我正要找洋镐去修暗堡，指导员走过来，拍着我的肩膀说：“张德全同志！你冒着炮火抢救战场上受难的群众，算是为人民立了一大功！”我笑着，但是一句话也没有说，只是想着，在北关的倒塌房子里，是不是还有象她们这样可怜的人呢？
