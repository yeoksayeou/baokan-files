　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 14th: The Harbin democratic government is extensively organizing impoverished city residents to engage in sideline production such as weaving, sewing clothes, and making shoes. The Northeast Textile Administration allocates 100,000 yuan in bonuses each month and has distributed 1,000 jin of cotton to the Taiping District. Currently, there are over 1,400 weaving households in the Dongchuanjia District. The organization method involves distributing cotton through the district production cooperatives and calculating wages based on skill level, allowing each person to earn 7,000 to 8,000 yuan per month. With the assistance of the district government, the Impoverished People's Association has established factories for shoe-making, bedding, weaving, and soap-making since February. The district's shoe factory, in addition to its formal factory workers, has over 2,000 impoverished people participating in tasks such as sewing shoe soles, making quilted covers, and sorting hemp rope outside the factory, each earning an income of 10,000 yuan per month.
