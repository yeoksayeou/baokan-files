　　Instructions from the Border Region Trade Bureau
  　Strictly Prohibit Counterfeiting of Foreign Cigarettes
    [Special dispatch from this newspaper] To promote the development of domestically produced cigarettes and strictly prohibit counterfeiting, the Trade Bureau has issued the following instructions: 1. All cigarette factories in various regions should re-register with the local Industry and Commerce Bureau or Office before being allowed to operate. 2. The cigarettes produced by each factory should have independent and distinct brands, and counterfeiting or imitating foreign cigarettes should be absolutely prohibited for identification purposes, and the use of foreign languages is not allowed. 3. Cigarette materials should use local products of this region as much as possible, and cigarette wrappers should not be printed with imitation paper and pound paper to reduce the import of foreign goods. 4. All those that do not comply with the above two or three provisions shall be subject to review by the district bureau, with a time limit for use or promotion to the outside, and shall be corrected immediately. If counterfeit or imitation foreign cigarettes are found again after the deadline, using imitation paper and pound paper printed box skins, or the brand name still uses foreign languages, it shall be treated as foreign cigarettes entering the country, and all shall be confiscated.
