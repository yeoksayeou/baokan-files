　　[This newspaper, Ji Luyu, 17th dispatch] Yanggu villages are carrying out spring plowing in conjunction with land investigation and property distribution. In Lizhuang, District One, some of the windfall wealth has not yet been fully distributed. In order to prevent the distribution of property from delaying spring plowing, the leadership mobilized the masses in the village to meet and discuss solutions. It was decided to carry out spring plowing during the day and distribute property at night: (1) All livestock and capable laborers in the village must participate in spring plowing, giving priority to military dependents and households without labor. During this period, livestock will not be used for private work. (2) Women should take more care of household chores during the spring plowing rush, such as carrying water, chopping grass, and feeding cattle, and also seize the time to spin and weave. At night, meetings are held to distribute windfall wealth. In Xiaozeng Village, District Five, production mutual aid is carried out during land investigation and property investigation. However, there are very few village cattle. A total of nine mutual aid groups have been organized, with livestock and carts uniformly allocated. Each group has two carts, five to six young people, and old people are also organized to do odd jobs. In Jiangtai Village, mutual aid was used to haul manure during the autumn plowing. In just two days, the entire village's manure hauling task was completed. The masses said, "Mutual aid is still the best."

　　阳谷各村互助春耕
    【本报冀鲁豫十七日电】阳谷各村结合查田分财进行春耕。一区李庄还有一部浮财没有分完，领导上为了分财不耽误春耕，发动全村群众开会商量解决办法，决定白天春耕、晚上分财：（一）全庄大小能干活的牲口一律参加春耕，先给军工属及无劳动力户突击，在此期内牲口不干私活。（二）妇女在春耕突击中，要多照顾家中杂活，如担水、铡草、喂牛等，并抓紧纺花织布。夜间开会分配浮财，五区校曾村在查田查财中，进行生产互助，但村牛很少，共组织了九个互助组，牲口大车统一分配，每组大车两辆，青年五人至六人，老头也组织进去，让他们做零星活。将台村秋耕中互助拉粪，仅两天工夫，全村拉粪任务即完成，群众说：“还是互助好。”
