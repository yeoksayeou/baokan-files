　　UN Holds Special Assembly
    To Discuss Palestine Issue
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th] Comprehensive report: The Palestine issue, arising from the contradictions between the US and Britain, began preliminary discussions at the UN Special Assembly which opened in New York on the 28th. Representatives from a total of 55 countries attended, with former Brazilian Foreign Minister Dr. Oswaldo Aranha as chairman, and representatives from the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, France, China (Chiang), India, and Ecuador as vice-chairmen. The assembly will organize a steering committee or general affairs committee to discuss the agenda. It is reported that the main item on the agenda is how to organize the Palestine investigation committee. As to whether the Arab countries' proposal to immediately terminate Britain's mandate and declare Palestine's independence will be included in the agenda, it has not yet been determined. On the eve of the opening of the UN Special Assembly, Palestine "terrorists," under the instigation of the United States, launched new terrorist actions. The Haifa police chief was murdered on the night of the 26th. British High Commissioner for Palestine, Cunningham, had planned to strengthen the suppression, obtaining the consent of British Middle East Commander-in-Chief Dempsey to transfer British troops from Egypt to deal with the terrorist actions. Currently, there are two and a half British divisions, approximately 100,000 troops, in Palestine. The local government is currently considering implementing martial law.
