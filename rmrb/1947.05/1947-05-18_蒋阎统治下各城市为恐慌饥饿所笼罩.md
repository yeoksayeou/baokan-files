　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th—Panic, unemployment, and hunger are enveloping the major cities under the tyrannical rule of Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan. In Taiyuan, slogans like "Strictly prevent thieves" and "Everyone should pay attention to maintaining social order" are plastered all over the city. According to official admissions, since February, 553 cases of theft, gambling, and opium dens have been uncovered, averaging nearly twenty cases per day. Datong is flooded with American goods, and over a hundred companies, including the famous Datong Alcohol Company and the Datong Flour Mill, have declared bankruptcy, leaving more than five thousand workers and apprentices unemployed and roaming the streets. More than fifteen hundred merchants in the city have been forced to join the "Chamber of Commerce," and each household must pay "membership fees" ranging from 20,000 to 80,000 yuan. The number of other taxes is countless. Taking brokers and vendors as an example, the three items of business tax, income tax, and stamp tax paid each month account for 80% of their total capital. Driven by livelihood pressures, many citizens are painfully forcing their wives and daughters into prostitution. An old Mr. Ma from a "family of scholars" sold his three biological daughters to brothels under different names for a price of one million yuan. American goods, drugs, prostitutes, and secret agents are known as the "four excesses of Hongdong." The drugs are mostly transported from Xi'an by Hu Zongnan's army, while the secret agents are a large number of "People's Service Corps" and "Three People's Principles Youth League" members sent from Xi'an.
　　According to the Qingdao "Civil Daily" of late last month, Qingdao is facing a severe coal shortage, with the city's coal reserves only enough for less than ten days. The city's power plant has begun to cut off electricity for six hours a day, and merchants are prohibited from using electric heaters and buying and selling electric stoves. Xu Yiguan, the manager of the power plant, said that if the coal shortage is not resolved in the short term, it will directly affect industrial production and workers' livelihoods. Industries such as tap water, news agencies, radio stations, and movies will also be shut down, and the seriousness is no less than an economic panic. The Chiang-controlled Municipal Council also exclaimed that a day of power outage would not only endanger public security but also affect the entire military operation.
　　According to a Central News Agency report on the 8th, in Andong, which has been oppressed by Chiang's army for the past six months, "the market is depressed, transportation is hindered, industries are stagnant, food is scarce, and people's lives are extremely difficult." According to a report in the Ta Kung Pao, Gao Xibing, the Chiang-appointed chairman of Andong Province, recently submitted his resignation to Xiong Shihui, confessing in the document that "the farmers' hunger and suffering have not been eliminated but have increased, the workers' unemployment has not decreased but has become more severe, the merchants are still closed due to lack of resources, and travelers are hesitant to move forward due to dangerous roads. There is an extreme shortage of local military forces, making it impossible to support the consecutive fall of Ji'an, Jin Chuan and Liuhe in Andong Province." (Note: Liberated by the Democratic Allied Forces) When answering reporters, he frequently said, "It is hard to say in one word."

　　蒋阎统治下各城市为恐慌饥饿所笼罩
    【新华社陕北十四日电】恐慌、失业与饥饿正笼罩蒋阎暴政统治下之各大城市。太原市“严防小偷”“人人要注意维持社会秩序”等标语口号涂满全城。据官方承认：二月来，查获窃盗、烟赌案即达五五三件，平均每日近二十起之多。大同市美货充斥，原大同著名的酒精公司、大面粉厂等百余家均宣告倒闭，已有五千余工人、学徒失业，流离街头。城内十五百家商贩被迫加入“商会”，每家须纳“会费”二万至八万元。其他捐税之多，无法枚举，以掮商行贩论，每月所纳之营业税、所得税及印花税三项，即占其全部血本的百分之八十。市民为生计所迫，不少忍痛令其妻女转操皮肉生涯。一“诗书名第”之马老先生，以百万元押价把三个亲生女儿改名换姓送至妓院。洪洞之美货、毒品、娼妓和特务，被称为“洪洞四多”。毒品多系胡军自西安运来，而特务则系从西安派来之大批“人民服务团”及“三青团”团员。
    又据上月下旬青岛“平民报”载：青岛市煤荒严重，全市存煤不足旬日之用。该市电气厂已开始每天停电六小时，禁止商民使用电热及买卖电炉。该电厂经理徐一贯称：煤荒如在短期间不解决，将直接影响工业生产、工人生计；自来水、新闻报社、电台、电影等各业，亦将停闭，其严重性不下于经济恐慌。蒋记市参议会亦惊呼：一日停电，不惟治安堪虞，即整个军事行动亦将受其影响。
    据中央社八日透露：半年来蒋军压榨下的安东，“市面萧条，交通阻滞，产业不振，食粮缺乏，人民生活已极艰苦。”又据大公报证实：蒋记安东省主席高惜冰，日前向熊式辉提出辞呈。文中自供：“农民饥苦未除而倍增，工人失业未减而愈重，商家因困窘无术而依旧停业，行旅因道路阻险而裹足不前。地方武力奇缺，无法支持，致安东省辑安、金川、柳河相继沦陷。”（按：为民主联军解放）彼于答记者时频称：“一言难尽”。
