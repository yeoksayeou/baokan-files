　　Licheng First District Breaks with Thinking of Waiting for Rain
    Plants 8,600 Mu in Drought Resistance
    [This newspaper, Licheng News] At the beginning of May, the county proposed to fight against drought and launched the work of carrying water to plant cotton. The cadres of the first district immediately made arrangements and mobilized the people with the base point as the unit, and the villages have begun to take action. Originally, the masses in the villages generally had the idea of waiting for rain and fearing the cost of labor, which hindered the vigorous development of the planting movement. For example, Liu Datu of Xiwu Village said, "There is no soil in the field, and it won't come out if planted. I plan to wait a few days for a rain before planting." Liu Gentang, deputy village chief of Zhaodian Village, said, "Traditionally, millet is planted during the Little Fullness (solar term), and corn during the芒种(Mangzhong) solar term. It's better to wait a few days. If it rains, it will save labor." Yang Kuanxin of Beishe said, "It is possible to carry water to plant cotton if it doesn't rain, but it takes too much work to carry water. On average, it takes five or six workdays to plant one mu, and each workday costs ten jin of rice, which is fifty or sixty jin of rice. It's better to wait for a rain to save trouble." After research and discussion by the district cadres, they carried out in-depth ideological mobilization to break the idea of waiting for rain, stabilize wages, and organize all able-bodied and semi-able-bodied laborers to carry out the drought-resistant planting campaign. Since then, 31 main villages have been involved in spring plowing and planting, and carrying water to plant. In the process of the seven days after the Beginning of Summer, after inspection and summary, according to the statistics of 32 villages, there are a total of 50,947.5 mu of autumn land, 3,981 full male laborers, 1,903 semi-able-bodied laborers, 2,685 full female laborers, 1,467 semi-able-bodied laborers, and 1,273 child laborers. 3,882 full male laborers, 1,503 semi-able-bodied laborers, 2,585 full female laborers, 1,367 semi-able-bodied laborers, and 1,173 children have been organized. 135 mutual aid groups combining agriculture, sideline occupations, and war support, 170 groups combining agriculture and sideline occupations, and 158 general groups have been reorganized. At present, 4,376 mu of cotton have been planted with water, 4,214 mu of Jin Huanghou and hemp have been planted, and 8,145 mu of millet have been planted. This spring, 32 villages have added 51 mules, 11 horses, 140 donkeys, and 52 cattle. At present, all villages in the district are carrying out a drought-resistant and rush-planting campaign led by heroic cadres and activists. (Ren Qing, Cheng Ke, Wang Xian)
    [Another News] Due to the spring drought and lack of rain, Shen Yuqin, a labor hero from Renzhuang in the second district of Licheng, launched a campaign to carry water to plant cotton. At first, the masses complained that it was too labor-intensive and had the idea of waiting for rain. Shen Yuqin led his group to plant in his own fields first, mobilizing the cadres to take the lead, and the masses also rose up. Each family transferred the autumn land near the water well that was prepared for planting millet and corn to plant cotton. If there was no nearby land, they would also plant in distant land. All able-bodied and semi-able-bodied laborers were mobilized to rush to plant from early morning to late night. From the fifteenth to the twentieth day of the third lunar month, the whole village planted more than 110 mu of cotton in six days, and is preparing to rush to plant for another five or six days. On the evening of the 20th, the production committee and representatives of each group conducted a merit evaluation. Shen Yuqin was a model leader, taking care of everything and guiding the technology, promoting everyone, and the whole group passed the resolution to record ten points of merit. Shen Yuanxian responded to the call and planted 20 mu of flowers for the whole group, and was awarded seven points of merit. Retired soldier Shen Heqin worked hard to carry water. Others carried four trips, but he carried five trips, and he received a reward for one shift from the group every day. This time, he was also awarded six points of merit. Shen Kui, the deputy captain of the second team, and Li Weiqin, etc., have all made contributions to promoting flower planting. Now Renzhuang has great confidence in carrying water to plant seedlings. After planting cotton, they will plant Jin Huanghou. Shen Yuanxian's group has already started planting millet, and has the confidence to fight against the spring drought. They said, "Don't be afraid of spending too much effort, catch the small seedlings to avoid losses!"

　　黎城一区打破等雨思想
    抗旱点种八千六百亩
    【本报黎城讯】五月初县里提出向旱灾作斗争，展开担水点棉后，一区干部即以基点为单位布置动员，各村已开始行动起来。原来各村群众普遍存在着等待下雨，怕出工资思想，阻碍着下种运动的有力开展。如西仵村刘大秃说：“地里无土，种上不出来，我计划迟几天等天下场雨再来种。”赵店副村长刘根堂说：“向来是种小满谷，芒种玉茭，还是等几天，万一要下场雨种上庄稼省工。”北社杨宽心说：“天不下雨担水栽棉花到可以，就是担水栽下来误工太多，平均每栽一亩总得五、六个工，每工十斤米就得五、六十斤米出，还是等一等下场雨省事。”经过区干部研究讨论，深入思想动员，打破等待下雨思想，平抑工资，组织所有全半劳力，开展抗旱点种运动，从此卅一个主村都卷入了春耕下种，担水栽种。在交立夏七天的过程中，经过检查总结，根据卅二个村的统计，共有秋地五万零九百四十七亩五分，男全劳力三千九百八十一个，半劳力一千九百零三个，女全劳力二千六百八十五个，半劳力一千四百六十七个，儿童劳力一千二百七十三个。已组织起男全劳力三十八百八十二个，半劳力一千五百零三个；女全劳力二千五百八十五个，半劳力一千三百六十七个；儿童一千一百七十三个。整顿起农副业战勤结合互助组一百三十五组；农副业结合组一百七十组，一般组一百五十八组。现已担水点种棉花四千三百七十六亩，栽金皇后、大麻等四千二百一十四亩，种谷八千一百四十五亩。今春三十二个村添买骡五十一头、马十一头、驴一百四十头，牛五十二头。目前全区各村正在开展以英雄干部积极分子为核心带头防旱突击下种运动。（任卿、程克、王先）
    【又讯】春旱不雨，黎城二区仁庄劳英申玉芹发动担水栽棉花。开头群众嫌太费工，有等天下雨思想。申玉芹就带领他这一组先往自己地里栽种，动员干部起带头作用，群众也都起来了，各家把离水井近准备种谷种玉茭的秋地，调换栽上棉花，没有近地，远地也要栽。全半劳力，全部动员，起早搭夜，突击下种，从阴历三月十五日至廿日，六天全村栽棉花一百一十多亩，还准备再突击五、六天。二十日晚上生产委员会及各组代表进行评功，申玉芹领导模范，照顾全面，指导技术，推动大家，全体通过记功十分。申元贤响应号召全组栽花二十亩，评功七分。退伍军人申河芹担水卖力气，别人担四遭，他就担五遭，每天得组里奖工一晌，这次也评功六分。二队副队长申魁及李维芹等都因推动栽花立了功。现在仁庄担水栽苗的信心很大，栽罢棉花就要栽金皇后。申元贤组已开始种谷，有信心和春旱作斗争，他们说：“不怕费工多，捉住小苗才不吃亏哩！”
