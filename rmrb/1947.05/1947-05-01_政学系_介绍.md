Introduction to the "Political Science Clique"

　　The "Political Science Clique" is one of Chiang Kai-shek's four major direct factions. Chiang Kai-shek's traditional division of labor roughly consists of the "Political Science Clique" managing politics, the "Revival Clique" managing the military, the "CC Clique" managing the party, and relatives managing finances. Although the "Political Science Clique's" position in the central government of Chiang's government has fluctuated due to a lack of military power, it has historically shared the limelight with the "CC Clique" and "Revival Clique" in local governments. Especially at critical political junctures and in important regions, Chiang Kai-shek has always relied on the "Political Science Clique." During the ten-year civil war, Yang Yongtai was the secretary-general of the General Headquarters for the Suppression of Communists; Huang Fu was the chairman of the Beiping Political Affairs Committee; Zhang Qun was the mayor of Shanghai and Minister of Foreign Affairs after the "September 18th Incident," and later served as the chairman of Sichuan Province during the War of Resistance; Chen Yi was the chairman of Fujian Province and later served as the chief administrator of Taiwan; Xiong Shihui is the current director of the Northeast Pacification Headquarters, who is launching the civil war in Northeast China. This time, Chiang Kai-shek has brought Zhang Qun out to serve as the President of the Executive Yuan in an attempt to overcome the most difficult hurdle in his history. What is different this time from the past is that the "Political Science Clique" not only holds the administrative power under Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial rule, but also replaced Kong and Song in controlling financial power. Before the "reorganization," Song Ziwen had already "resigned," and Zhang Jia'ao (alias Gongquan) of the "Political Science Clique" replaced Bei Zuyi of the Song faction as the president of the Central Bank, becoming the direct manager of the four major families. The "Political Science Clique" was the leader of the "Northern Four Banks" (Yanye, Jin cheng, Zhongnan, and Dalu) as early as the era of the Northern Warlords. After the establishment of the Nanjing government, the status of the "Northern Four Banks" was gradually replaced by the "Southern Four Banks" (Central, China, Transportation, and China Peasants) and further became vassals of the "Southern Four Banks." However, in the Bank of Communications, the "Political Science Clique" still maintained an advantage over the "CC Clique's" two Chens, and the president, Qian Xinzhi, was close to the "Political Science Clique." In local banks, the "Political Science Clique" remains a powerful group.
　　
　　In this "National Government Committee," there is a man named Chen Huide (alias Guangfu), who is also one of the four major families' managers, simultaneously inheriting from the Kong family and the "Political Science Clique." It is no accident that Chiang Kai-shek appointed Zhang Gongquan as the president of the Central Bank and Chen Guangfu as a member of the National Government Committee. By using them to replace the two comprador families of Kong and Song, he hopes to make up for the loss of credit that Kong and Song have suffered among the Americans, and to decorate the facade of their so-called "liberal elements." In fact, Zhang and Chen were originally pro-American elements and have always been old hands at borrowing foreign debts for Chiang Kai-shek. These two compradors, who are familiar to the United States, have long been appreciated by Wall Street bosses. After the "reorganization" of the Executive Yuan, Foreign Minister Wang Shijie and Finance Minister Yu Hongjun are both pro-"Political Science Clique" figures. Others such as Weng Wenhao, Wang Yunwu, Mo Dehui, Miao Jiaming, Wang Zhenglun, and Lei Zhen are also close to the "Political Science Clique."
　　
　　After this "reorganization," the "Political Science Clique" has indeed become one of the main components in Chiang's government. But it must be made clear that the control of warlords, party bosses, and secret agents in Chiang Kai-shek's government has not weakened at all. Military power is still in the hands of the "Revival Clique," which is obsessed with civil war, and Zhang Lisheng, Yu Dawei, Zhu Jiahua, Gu Zhenggang, and others who are close to the Chen Cheng group still maintain their original ministerial positions. In the chairmanships of local governments, the "Revival Clique" still occupies a large proportion. At the same time, the "CC Clique," which manipulates party power, still dominates party and secret service organizations, and Chiang Kai-shek appointed Chen Lifu, the head of the "CC Clique," as the secretary-general of the Kuomintang Political Committee precisely to restrain the "Political Science Clique," so that he can use the contradictions of dog-eat-dog to manipulate them. As for financial power, the "Political Science Clique" cannot monopolize it. Although "Kong and Song's figures (such as Bei Zuyi) no longer appear in public, Kong and Song still have considerable positions in the Central, China, Communications, and China Peasants banks. Therefore, no matter how it is "reorganized," in essence, Chiang Kai-shek still presides over these four direct factions, maintaining his dictatorial rule.
　　
　　Why does Chiang Kai-shek value the "Political Science Clique" so much now?
　　
　　In modern Chinese history, the Political Science Clique is a typical bureaucratic politician group. When the National Assembly split between 1917 and 1918, the Political Science Clique used Li Genyuan's participation in the Southwestern campaign against Yuan Shikai to formally form in the Southwest. At that time, it colluded with Qing Dynasty loyalist Cen Chunxuan to exclude Sun Yat-sen, presided over the Southwestern military government, and shared the rule of China with the Northern Warlords. Later, during the North-South peace talks, the Political Science Clique became the intermediary for compromise between the Southwest and the Northern Warlords. Since then, the Political Science Clique has successively participated in the Xu Shichang and Cao Kun governments, becoming an indispensable bureaucratic group in the Northern government. It used its political position to become the backbone of Northern bureaucratic capital and the big shots of the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the "Northern Four Banks," with Wu Dingchang and Zhang Gongquan as its representatives.
　　
　　During the Northern Expedition, Zhang Qun first represented the Northern Warlords to Guangzhou and Nanchang to collude with Chiang Kai-shek. Thus, the Northern and Southern Warlords, as representatives of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, reached a tacit understanding of cooperation, and Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the revolution began with the execution of Chen Zanxian, the chairman of the Ganzhou Trade Union. Soon after, the saying "Military Northern Expedition, Political Southern Expedition" spread in society; the representative figure of the political Southern Expedition was Zhang Qun. Another representative of the Political Science Clique, Wang Boqun, ran to Shanghai to win over his brother-in-law He Yingqin, expanding the scope of activities of the Political Science Clique in Chiang's army.
　　
　　Since then, the Political Science Clique has become an indispensable component of the Nanjing Chiang government. Yang Yongtai, who was the most vehement opponent of Sun Yat-sen's ideas, became Chiang Kai-shek's most trusted assistant at this time. After Yang Yongtai was killed by the CC Clique, Zhang Qun continued to rise as the leader of the Political Science Clique. The Political Science Clique's policy of selling out the country to foreigners and harming the people internally is no less than that of the CC, Revival, and relatives cliques. For example, the famous pro-Japanese element Huang Fu's pro-Japanese treachery and massacre of youth during his tenure as chairman of the Beiping Political Affairs Committee; Yang Yongtai's implementation of the Baojia system during the civil war, poisoning the people; Zhang Qun's pro-Japanese treachery during his tenure as Minister of Foreign Affairs; Shen Honglie's collusion with the enemy to oppose the Communists and massacre the people during his tenure as chairman of Shandong; and Chen Yi's recent massacres and corruption in Taiwan are all clear examples.
　　
　　The specialty of the Political Science Clique is to use perfunctory means to embellish the reactionary rule and deceive the masses; this is why Chiang Kai-shek must value them. But today, when Chiang Kai-shek's ruling group is more corrupt, fragile, incompetent, and approaching death, and when the awakening of the broad masses of the people has been raised to an unprecedented level and the People's Liberation Army is increasingly victorious, its deceptive role will soon be exposed and declared bankrupt.
　　
　　The representative figures of the Political Science Clique who have died are Yang Yongtai and Huang Fu, and now they are Zhang Qun, Wu Dingchang, Zhang Gongquan, Wu Tiecheng, Xiong Shihui, Shen Honglie, and Chen Yi, etc. (Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th)

　　“政学系”介绍
    “政学系”是蒋介石四大嫡系之一，蒋介石历来的分工大体是“政学”管政，“复兴”管军，“ＣＣ”管党，亲属管财。“政学系”虽然由于缺少兵权，在蒋政府中枢的地位呈时起时落状态，但在地方政权中，却历来与“ＣＣ”“复兴”平分秋色的，尤其在政治紧要关头与重要地方，蒋介石总是要用“政学系”的。十年内战中，杨永泰就是剿共总司令部的秘书长；黄郛是北平政务委员会委员长；张群是“九一八”以后的上海市长和外交部长，抗战期间又任四川省主席；陈仪是福建省主席，后来又任台湾长官；熊式辉是现在发动东北内战的行辕主任。这次蒋又拉张群出任行政院长，企图渡过其历史上最困难的难关。这次与以往不同的，是“政学系”不仅执掌了蒋介石独裁统治下的行政权，而且代替孔、宋掌握了财政权。“改组”之前，宋子文就已“辞职”，以“政学系”张嘉＠（号公权）代替宋系的贝祖诒任中央银行总裁，做了四大家族的直接经纪人。“政学系”远在北洋军阀时代就是盐业、金城、中南、大陆“北方四行”的领导人。南京政府成立后，“北方四行”的地位虽然逐渐为“南方四行”（中央、中国、交通、中国农民）所代替，并进而变成“南方四行”的附庸，但在交通银行中，“政学系”仍较“ＣＣ”两陈保有优势，行长钱新之就是接近“政学系”的人物；而在地方银行中，“政学系”仍然是强有力的集团。
    在此次“国府委员”中，有个叫陈辉德（号光甫）的，也是兼祧孔家与“政学系”的四大家族经纪人之一。蒋介石以张公权为中央银行总裁，陈光甫为国府委员，不是偶然的。以他们来代替孔、宋两买办，为的是希望借此弥补一下孔、宋在美国人中多少失去的信用，装饰其所谓“自由主义分子”的门面。实际上张、陈原来就是亲美分子，一向也是替蒋介石借外债的老手。这两个为美国所熟悉的买办，早就得到华尔街老板的赏识。行政院“改组”后，外长王世杰、财长俞鸿钧都是亲“政学系”的分子。其他如翁文灏、王云五、莫德惠、缪嘉铭、王正伦、雷震等也都是接近“政学系”的。
    在这次“改组”后，蒋府人物中，“政学系”的确成了主要成份之一。但必须弄清，蒋介石政府中军阀、党阀、特务的控制力是一点未减弱的。军权仍掌握在醉心内战的“复兴”系手中，而且接近陈诚集团的张厉生、俞大维、朱家骅、谷正纲等仍然保持原来的部长位置。而在地方政府主席中，“复兴系”仍占很大的比例。同时，操纵党权的“ＣＣ”系仍支配着党务特务组织，而蒋介石以“ＣＣ”头子陈立夫任国民党政治委员会秘书长，正是以此牵制“政学系”，好便于他利用狗打架的矛盾来操纵他们。至于财权，“政学系”也不能独揽。“孔、宋系的人物（贝祖诒等）虽不抛头露面了，但在中中交农四行中，孔、宋仍有其相当地位。所以不论其如何“改组”，实质上蒋介石仍然是驾临于这四个嫡系之上，维持其独裁统治。
    何以蒋介石现在如此器重“政学系”呢？
    在中国近代史上，政学系是一个典型的官僚政客集团。当民国六、七年间国会分裂时，“政学系”即利用李根源参加西南讨袁的地位，在西南正式组成。当时曾勾结满清遗老岑春煊排斥孙中山，主持西南军政府，与北洋军阀分掌中国的统治。以后南北议和，“政学系”成为西南与北洋军阀妥协的媒介。从此“政学系”先后参加了徐世昌、曹锟政府，成为北洋政府中不可缺少的官僚集团。并利用其政治地位，成了北方官僚资本的中坚，及中国银行、交通银行以及“北方四行”的大亨，其代表人物便是吴鼎昌和张公权。
    北伐之时，张群首先代表北方军阀至广州和南昌，与蒋介石进行勾结拉拢。于是做为大地主大资产阶级代表的南北军阀取得了合作默契，而蒋介石的叛变革命，亦以枪决赣州工会委员长陈赞贤为标志而开始。不久以后社会上盛传“军事北伐，政治南伐”；其政治南伐的代表人物，就是张群。以为“政学系”的另一代表王伯群跑到上海拉拢其妹婿何应钦，扩大了“政学系”在蒋系军队中的活动范围。
    自此以后，“政学系”就成为南京蒋政府中不可缺少的成份。反对孙中山主张最厉害的杨永泰，这时成了蒋介石最亲信的助手。杨永泰被ＣＣ系打死了以后，张群就继续起为“政学系”的领导人物。“政学系”对外卖国、对内残民的政策，并不亚于ＣＣ、复兴及亲属等三系。例如著名亲日分子黄郛，在北平主持政务委员会时期的亲日卖国，屠杀青年；杨永泰在内战时期的实行保甲制度，荼毒人民；张群做外交部长时期的亲日卖国；沈鸿烈在山东当主席时期的通敌反共，屠杀人民；以及不久前陈仪在台湾的屠杀、贪污行为等等，均其明证。
    “政学系”的专长，是用敷衍手段，为反动统治粉饰门面，欺骗群众；这就是蒋介石所以必须重用他们的缘故。但时至今日，当蒋介石统治集团更加腐败脆弱无能与接近死亡的时候，当广大人民的觉悟空前提高，人民解放军日益胜利的时候，其欺骗作用必将很快被揭穿而宣告破产。
    “政学系”的代表人物死掉的有杨永泰、黄郛，现在则是张群、吴鼎昌、张公权、吴铁城、熊式辉、沈鸿烈、陈仪等。（新华社陕北二十八日电）
