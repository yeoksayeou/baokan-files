[From Our Correspondent on the Northern Henan Front, 6th] A certain general, who commanded the People's Liberation Army in capturing Tangyin and completely annihilating the Chiang Kai-shek puppet 3rd Corps, spoke to reporters about the significance of this campaign, stating: (1) Our army's complete annihilation of Sun Dianying's troops has eliminated a major scourge for the people of northern Henan. Sun, a traitor who first surrendered to the Japanese and then served as a pawn in Chiang Kai-shek's civil war, frantically attacked the liberated areas. The people of northern Henan called him a "venomous insect," and had long hoped that the People's Liberation Army would kill this "venomous insect" for them. This demand has been fully met. (2) Tangyin was an important strategic stronghold for Chiang Kai-shek in northern Henan. After Tangyin was uprooted, our army's initiative has greatly increased. When we besieged Tangyin, Wang Zhonglian led a large army to reinforce it three times. The reinforcements were either repelled or annihilated. Chiang Kai-shek, exhausted and out of ideas, could only resort to "cheering" Sun Dianying to hold Tangyin to the death. Our army captured a document from the Kuomintang's highest authorities to Sun Dianying, encouraging him, stating: "Duke Dian is fighting valiantly as an isolated force, with glorious results. We will spare no sacrifice and will plan for the entire northern Henan situation, and will resolutely do our utmost to relieve Duke Dian." But the facts prove how vicious Chiang Kai-shek's trick of using miscellaneous bandit traitors as cannon fodder in the civil war was, and to what extent his forces were insufficient. (3) This operation proves that our army is not only good at annihilating the enemy in mobile warfare, but also capable of conducting beautiful siege battles and achieving complete victory. Sun Dianying's troops were quite stubborn. When our assault troops broke through the city wall, Sun Dianying personally supervised the battle, concentrating superior forces to counterattack us. But our people's soldiers were even more stubborn, advancing wave upon wave, charging repeatedly eleven times, and finally annihilating all the stubborn enemies.

    [From Our Correspondent on the Northern Henan Front, 6th] The People's Liberation Army captured two interesting documents in Tangyin. One is Sun Dianying's final instruction to his subordinates, which said: "From today (the 1st) onwards, there are two more difficult days (reporter's note: from the issuance of the order to being captured alive was only half a day). Our success or benevolence depends on these two days; if we can't get through it, I will sacrifice with everyone (note: it is to be a prisoner with everyone)." And he deceived his soldiers by saying: "The families of all officers and soldiers who sacrifice will be entirely my responsibility." (Note: Sun Dianying himself doesn't know who to ask to be responsible!) The other is Sun's "extremely urgent" telegram to Wang Zhonglian, which said: "The bandits are shelling me, it is unknown whether I can hold out tonight, please order the reinforcement troops to overcome all obstacles and rush here, then the subordinate and the general may have a day to meet." (Note: There will be a day to meet, that is when Wang Zhonglian is captured alive).

　　某将军谈扑灭孙殿英部意义
    为豫北人民除一大害  我军主动权更加增大
    【本报豫北前线六日电】指挥人民解放军攻克汤阴、全部歼灭蒋伪第三纵队之某将军，对记者谈此役意义称：（一）我军彻底歼灭孙殿英部，为豫北人民除一大害。孙逆先降日本，后充蒋介石内战走卒，疯狂进攻解放区，豫北人民称之为“毒虫”，豫北人民老早就盼望解放军替他们把这条“毒虫”打死，这个要求是全部达到了。（二）汤阴为蒋介石在豫北的重要战略据点；拔除汤阴之后，我军主动权更加增大。当我围困汤阴时，王仲廉曾率大军三次增援，援兵或被击退，或遭聚歼。蒋介石力竭智穷，只好用“打气”的办法要孙殿英在汤阴死守。我军缴获国民党最高当局致孙殿英鼓励文件称：“殿公孤军奋战，战果辉煌；我当不惜任何牺牲，定为整个豫北战局打算，决以全力为殿公解围。”但事实则证明蒋介石利用杂牌汉奸充当内战炮灰的鬼把戏是如何狠毒，以及他的兵力不足到何种地步。（三）此次作战证明我军不仅善于在运动中歼灭敌人，而且也能进行漂亮的攻坚战斗，取得完满胜利。孙殿英部相当顽强，当我突击部队突破城墙时，孙殿英亲自督战，集中优势兵力，向我反扑。而我人民战士比他更顽强，前仆后继，反复冲锋十一次，终将顽敌全部歼灭。

    【豫北前线六日电】人民解放军在汤阴缴获了两个有趣的文件。一个是孙殿英对其部下最后的训令，上面说：“从今天（一日）起，还有两天困难的日子（记者按：从发命令到被活捉只有半天）。我们成功成仁，就在这两天；如过不去，我和大家一同牺牲（按：是与大家一同当俘虏）。”并欺骗其士兵说：“凡牺牲的官兵家属，完全由我负责”。（按：孙殿英自己还不知道叫谁负责呢！）另一个是孙逆给王仲廉“十万火急”的电报，里面说：“匪正向我炮击中，今夜能否支持过去，尚在不可知之数，请饬援军排除一切障碍，飞驰前来，则职与钧座或有相见之日也。”（按：相见之日是有的，那就是王仲廉被活捉的时候）。
