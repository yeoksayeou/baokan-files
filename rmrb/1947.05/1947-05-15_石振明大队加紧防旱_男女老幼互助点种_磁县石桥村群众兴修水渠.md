　　[This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 13th] Under the slogan "Participate in the War Without Delaying Production," the united brigade of Shi Zhenming mobilized men and women, old and young, to work in the fields. They have weeded 1,600 mu of wheat and planted all early autumn crops (yams, melons, beans, etc.). More than 2,000 mu of corn have been planted, accounting for more than three-fifths of the village's land. Old Hero Shi also called on everyone to prevent drought and plant carefully. Currently, the five main villages under Fan Village are busy planting in the river, with plans to finish planting more than 3,000 mu of land in the river by the 20th day of the third lunar month. All men and women, full and semi-laborers, and livestock in the 105 natural villages are organized into 87 mutual aid teams, implementing a system of assigning points based on work done, overcoming laziness and perfunctory work. Women and children are led by experienced farmers, with male full laborers carrying water for irrigation, and women, elderly men, and children plowing, sowing, and pulling livestock. Older children are organized to carry manure, and some laborers are drawn to repair canals. To enhance the enthusiasm of women and children for production, points are assigned and added based on different labor contributions. Children can rest for one day after working for three or five days. Currently, 17 women, including Wu Fenglan, can plow and harrow independently. Six children in Houzhai carried 2,120 loads of manure in ten days. Additionally, 13 primary school students weeded more than 300 mu of wheat for militia members participating in the war and their families. Therefore, participation in the war has not affected production.
　　[This newspaper's Taihang dispatch, 13th] In order to combat drought, Shiqiao Village in the Ninth District of Cixian County recently dug a water channel approximately four li long. The channel draws water from the Fuyang River and can irrigate more than 700 mu of land. After this, each of the 720 people in the village will have an average of one mu of irrigated land, ensuring that they can maintain their livelihood even in drought years. Although the village was close to the Fuyang River in the past, it was difficult to draw water because the riverbank was high. Therefore, only more than 300 mu of land could be irrigated with well water, which was very labor-intensive. This spring, at the request of the masses, a canal construction committee was established to carry out the excavation. The Agricultural and Forestry Bureau of the Fifth Administrative Office also provided special assistance. The funds were partly solved by the village, and the rest was solved by loans from the Jinnan Bank County Branch. All men and women, old and young, in the village worked hard for more than 20 days and the project has now been completed. In one section, which was about 200 steps long, the masses concentrated their efforts to chisel and blast with dynamite, finally overcoming this obstacle. In total, more than 3,500 workdays were used, and more than 500,000 Jinnan currency was spent. The masses said, "It doesn't matter how much labor or money is spent, we can earn it back in one year."

　　[This newspaper's Jinnan dispatch, 13th] The masses in Xueta Village, Weixian County, do not miss the season due to drought and are intensifying their efforts to plant. Liberated peasant Chunqiao said, "In the year of the famine, I gritted my teeth and planted one mu of melon, but I benefited greatly. Many people rely on the sky, but when the time comes, calling to heaven is no use, calling to the earth is no use." Zhai Huaifang said, "Dongmei and I treat the two mu of melons we planted as if they are our lives, and our family relies on these hundreds of melon plants to save our lives." The masses launched a planting campaign based on lessons learned from the famine years. First, they used large carts to transport water to plant cotton. One double-ox cart carried four large water vats holding 29 loads of water. Five strong mutual aid members planted four and a half mu of flower land two li away from the water source in one day.

　　石振明大队加紧防旱
    男女老幼互助点种
    磁县石桥村群众兴修水渠
    【本报太岳十三日电】石振明的联合大队在“参战不误生产”口号下，全村男女老幼齐下地，已将一千六百亩麦子锄完，并将早秋庄稼（山药蛋、瓜、豆等）全部下种，种玉茭二千余亩，占全村土地五分之三以上。老英雄并号召大家防旱点种。现范村所属五个主村均忙着在大河里下种，计划将大河里的三千多亩地在阴历三月二十号种完。其中一百零五个自然村所有的男女全半劳力与畜力都组织起来，共八十七个互助小组，实行按活定分，克服了偷懒应付等毛病。妇女儿童由有经验的庄稼汉带头，男全劳力担水灌，妇女与老汉小孩等犁地、丢籽、拉牲口，较大的儿童组织担粪，并抽出一部分劳力修渠。为提高妇女儿童生产情绪，按不同劳力记分加分，儿童做活三天或五天可以休息一天。现妇女吴凤兰等十七人已能独犁独耙。侯寨六个儿童十天担粪二一二○担，还有十三个小学生给参战民夫及军属锄麦三百余亩，所以参战并未影响生产。
    【本报太行十三日电】磁县九区石桥村为与旱灾斗争，最近开凿了一道长约四里的水渠。该渠引滏阳河之水，可浇地七百余亩，此后全村七百二十口人，每人平均有水地一亩，即使遭遇旱年，生活仍可维持。该村过去虽紧靠滏阳河，但因河岸高，引水困难，故只有井水浇地三百余亩，且费工很大。今春在群众的要求下，成立开渠委员会进行开凿，五专署农林局亦特予帮助，经费除由村解决一部外，余皆由冀南银行县支行贷款解决。全村男女老幼经二十余日努力，现已竣工，其中有一段长约二百余步的石节，大家集中力量用凿子凿，炸药崩，终于突过了这道障碍。总计共用工三千五百余，冀钞五十余万元，群众说：“费这些工，花这些钱不算什，一年就能赚回来”。（香圃）
    【本报冀南十三日电】威县雪塔群众不因天旱错过节令，加紧突击点种。翻身农民春桥说：“灾荒那年咬着牙点种了一亩瓜，可沾光啦。许多人靠天，到时候叫天天不应，叫地地不语”。翟怀芳说：“我和东梅点种的那二亩瓜，拿着当命一样看待，一家人就靠这几百棵瓜救了命。”群众从回忆灾荒年的教训中开展了点种运动。首先用大车拉水点种棉花，一辆双牛车放上四个大水瓮盛水二十九担，距水二里远的花地，五个壮年互助一天，便点了四亩半。
