In Memory of Comrade Song Qi
    Su Zhong, De Ming

    I.
    On April 2nd, Comrade Song Qi (originally a clerk of the 4th Company, later transferred to the battalion headquarters as a clerk, a Communist Party member), of a certain battalion of the 1036th Unit, who was also a war correspondent, died heroically while clearing out the outer strongholds of Jixian County! I remember on March 9th, at the Heroic Assembly of the × Brigade, he was selected as a first-class model of communication and reporting for the entire brigade. The brigade leaders called on the unit's clerks to learn from Song Qi, pointing out that his direction was the direction of all clerks! After that, the communication and reporting work of the × Brigade became unprecedentedly active! At this time, the death of Comrade Song Qi was indeed a great loss! Everyone felt deeply grieved at the mention of him!
    Reading his posthumous work "Why Submit Articles" allows us to see his personality, to see the true qualities of the People's Army embodied in him, and to see the simplicity and conciseness of his writing.

    II.
    During this march, Comrade Song Qi, in order to report in a timely manner, followed the company. During rest periods, he would record the materials he had gathered in his notebook. While walking, wanting to understand the soldiers' state of mind, he would walk and talk with them. Afraid that the soldiers would be tired from marching, he often helped them carry their guns and ammunition. He usually helped the soldiers learn to read, write letters home, read newspapers, and write articles. While marching, he carried a machine gun and told jokes, so the soldiers loved him very much and were willing to share their innermost thoughts with him. After everyone had fallen asleep each night after camping, he was still up under the lamp, sorting out the materials he had collected on the road and patiently revising the articles written by the clerks of each company (he was the reporting team leader). On March 23rd, after marching more than 60 li, he still wrote five articles. On the 25th, when the troops assembled for departure, he sat on the side and wrote two articles when they were not all present at once. During the march, he did his best to use his time to praise the marching models.

    Before the Battle of Jixian County, he ran to the first platoon of the fourth company and encouraged the soldiers, saying, "Protect Chairman Mao, fight well, I will follow you, and after you fight well, I will be responsible for writing articles and publishing them in the newspaper!" When the battle began, the instructor asked him to stay with the baggage, but he said, "No, I will be with everyone, so I can see the heroic deeds with my own eyes and report them in a timely manner!" On the front line, he was with the soldiers, holding a gun, and persisted all night. On April 2nd, he was wounded, but he did not utter a word. Unfortunately, another bullet flew over and pierced his heart. He shed his last drop of blood to protect Chairman Mao! When the medic Ren Qingshan climbed over, he still saw his diary and manuscripts left by his side!

　　悼宋琦同志
    苏众　德明
    一、
    四月二日，一○三六部某营兼随军记者，宋琦同志（原四连文书，后调营部文书，共产党员），在扫除汲县外围据点时殉职了！记得在三月九日，×旅群英大会上，他被选为全旅一等通讯报导模范，旅的首长曾号召部队文书向宋琦学习，指出他的方向，是文书的方向！这之后，×旅的通讯报导工作，空前的活跃起来！在这时，宋琦同志的死，确是一个很大的损失！一提起他来，大家莫不十分痛惜！
    读他遗作《为啥要投稿》可以看到他的个性，可以从他体现出人民军队的本色；可以看出他写稿的朴素与简练。
    二、
    这次行军中，宋琦同志为及时报导，跟着连队一起走，趁休息时，就将所得材料记在本子上，走路时，想了解战士的思想状况，他与战士们边走、边谈，怕战士行军疲劳，他常给战士们背枪，扛子弹；平时他帮助战士，认字、写家信、读报、写稿，行军又扛机枪说笑话，因此战士十分热爱他，愿意同他谈知心的话。每天宿营后，大家都睡了，他还在灯下整理路上收集的材料，耐心的修改各连文书写的稿子，（他是报导组长）三月二十三日，行军六十多里，他还写了五篇稿子，二十五日，出发大集合时，部队一时没有来齐，他就坐在一边，写了两篇稿子。行军中他尽力利用时间来表扬行军模范。
    汲县战斗前，他跑到四连一排，鼓励战士说：“保卫毛主席你们好好打，我跟上你们，打好后，我负责与你们写稿登报！”战斗开始，教导员叫他跟大行李，他说：“不，我同大家一块，好亲眼看到英勇事迹，及时报导！”在火线上他与战士在一处，拿着枪，坚持了一夜，四月二日，他挂了彩也不吭，不幸又一颗子弹飞来，穿过了他的心口，他为保卫毛主席，流尽了最后一滴血！当卫生员任庆善爬去时，还见到他的日记本和稿子遗留在身边！
