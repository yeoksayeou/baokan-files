　　Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 4th (Delayed Dispatch): A certain unit of the East China People's Liberation Army, in coordination with the battle of Tai'an and working alongside fraternal units on the eastern foothills of Mengshan, held the Jiunü Pass and Baima Pass, located more than 40 li southwest of Mengyin, from the 20th to the 26th of last month. In seven days and nights, they killed or wounded more than 2,000 troops of Chiang's 11th Division, successfully completing the ambush mission.
　　Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 4th: The East China People's Liberation Army recovered Tai'an and completely annihilated Chiang's 72nd Division. It is now confirmed that the following senior officers were captured alive: Division Commander Yang Wen＠, Deputy Division Commander Zhu Shunkun (formerly Commander of the 34th Brigade), Commander of the New 13th Brigade Yang Guomo, Deputy Brigade Commander Song Zhuqing, Brigade Chief of Staff Han Ming, Commander of the 34th Brigade Li Zeya, and Brigade Chief of Staff Liu Xinfu.
　　Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 4th (Delayed Dispatch): A certain unit of the East China People's Liberation Army, in coordination with the battle of Tai'an, recovered Beiliu, an important town 30 li south of Tai'an on the west side of the Jinpu Railway, at 3:00 AM on the 23rd of last month. At 8:00 AM on the same day, they repelled two battalions of the 6th Brigade of Chiang's 75th Division, which were attempting to reinforce from Dawenkou, in the area of Shiliu Mountain and Zhiting Mountain (more than 10 li northeast of Dawenkou). In the afternoon, Chiang's army launched three fierce attacks on Zhiting Mountain with a regiment, but all were repelled. At dawn on the 26th, they intercepted and captured 38 Chiang's soldiers fleeing south from Tai'an near Mahoutai, seizing three light machine guns and 37 rifles and pistols.
　　Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 4th: The results of the East China People's Liberation Army's recovery of Ningyang City are as follows: Two battalions of Zhao Guangxing's regiment of Wu Huawen's puppet troops and Lu Ziming's troops were annihilated. 787 officers and soldiers including Lu Ziming were captured alive, more than 400 were killed or wounded, and 12 mortars and 60mm guns, 17 machine guns, 558 rifles and pistols, more than 16,000 rounds of various ammunition, and 25 war horses were seized.
　　Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 4th: On the morning of the 26th, this reporter entered the city of Tai'an from West Guan Street with the victorious army. Some Chiang's troops were still holding out in several houses, putting up stubborn resistance. At the command of the People's Liberation Army commander, demolition experts quickly went forward to destroy Chiang's fortifications. After a few earth-shaking explosions, in less than a quarter of an hour, the People's Liberation Army heroes had returned with a hundred prisoners. The commander told this reporter: "This is the last batch of enemies." The majestic Dai Temple has temporarily become a reception center for thousands of prisoners of war. Under the giant mud statue of the god of Mount Tai, groups of Chiang's officers and soldiers sat down their weapons, carefully listening to the speeches of the People's Liberation Army liaison officers with astonished expressions. Groups of civilians who had been captured by Chiang's army to build fortifications walked happily home. Some voluntarily helped to clear the streets so that the People's Liberation Army could tow榴弹炮 and other spoils of war out of the city with trucks. Residents of the city were searching for door panels and tables and chairs from the remnants of Chiang's military fortifications. Many suffering people pulled People's Liberation Army soldiers aside to recount the atrocities of Chiang's army, and the People's Liberation Army distributed the seized grain to them.

    【新华社华东前线四日电】（迟到）华东人民解放军某部配合泰安之战，上月二十三日晨三时收复津浦路西侧泰安南三十里之重镇北留。同日上午八时在石榴山、芝亭山（大汶口东北十余里）一带击退自大汶口北援蒋军七十五师第六旅两个营，下午蒋军以一个团三次猛扑芝亭山，均被击退。二十六日拂晓，复在马后台附近截俘自泰安南逃之蒋军三十八名，缴获轻机枪三挺、长短枪三十七枝。
