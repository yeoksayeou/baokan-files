　　Fushan Draws Over a Hundred Cadres
    To Lead the Turnaround in New Districts
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 19th] The Fushan County Farmers' Association has drawn 135 people from veteran district cadres and Sanmin high school students to form a turnaround commando team to lead land reform in the first and third new districts. Before their departure on the 5th of this month, a meeting was held to discuss the implementation of policies in the newly recovered areas, and the guiding principle was determined to first dispel the masses' concerns, boost their morale, accuse the Jiang-Yan army of crimes, identify the roots of feudalism, and achieve a complete settlement and turnaround. Finally, everyone made three commitments to serve the people and achieve merit: (1) Persist in your posts, work actively, and always consider the masses. (2) Constantly learn from the masses, master policies, and promote creativity. (3) Be hardworking and simple, and do not purchase the fruits of the masses' struggle.

　　浮山抽派百余干部
    到新区领导翻身
    【本报太岳十九日电】浮山县农会抽调老区干部及三民高学生一百三十五人，组织翻身突击队，赴一、三两新区领导土地改革。本月五日临行前集会讨论新收复区政策的执行问题，确定方针是先打破群众顾虑，提高斗志，控诉蒋阎军罪行，找出封建祸根，总清算齐翻身。最后大家并约法三章为民立功：（一）坚持岗位，积极工作，处处为群众打算。（二）时时向群众学习，掌握政策，发扬创造。（三）艰苦朴素，不购买群众斗争果实。
