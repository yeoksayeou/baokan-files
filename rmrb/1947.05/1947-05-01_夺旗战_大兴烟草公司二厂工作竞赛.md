　　Flag Grabbing Competition
　　Work Contest at the No. 2 Factory of Daxing Tobacco Company
　　Jianpu
　　Since the labor model conference summarizing the "February 7th" competition, the entire factory has been filled with the sound of "Everyone showing their heroism, everyone displaying their might," "Produce, save, and make contributions quickly, adding glory upon glory" in the great competition to welcome "May Day."

　　Wang Lizhong, a technician from the cigarette rolling team who went from victory to defeat, was questioned by Manager He: "What's going on? You didn't hold the flag well, and the leaf sorting team took it away!" He was also countered by Song Bingquan, the packaging team leader: "Why are you packaging so little? Who's to blame if your cigarette rolling team isn't producing cigarettes?" Wang retorted anxiously, "If I don't produce 30,000 packs of cigarettes, and the packaging team ends up with an unmanageable pile of cigarettes, I'll change my name!" All the workers in the team were unconvinced and determined to achieve a sensational, shocking result. Under the fighting goal of "snatching the flag back," many amazing feats emerged.

　　After putting forward the slogan "We will not leave work until the task is completed," many workers voluntarily requested overtime in the general affairs office every day. Zhang Huancheng, Fu Chang, and others, who stirred the wheel, worked continuously for thirty-one hours over a day and two nights, persisting without leaving work. In the past, they looked forward to the end of the shift and leaving work early; now, they waited for the replacements to come to the workshop and urge them to hand over the shift before leaving, even though they only worked overtime for an hour to an hour and a half each shift, they were still not satisfied. Worker Wang Liusuo said, "We don't hand over the shift until tomorrow's breakfast after working the day shift until dark." In this competition of vying to work overtime, the workers sang all day: "Better than the Liangshan heroes, everyone is strong as steel, for the twenty-five thousand (Note: competition output), work overtime in the machine room."

　　In the overtime competition, the working time was extended from ten hours to eleven hours to eleven and a half hours, and the machines were running day and night.

　　Technician Wang personally operated Machine No. 2, proposing "I won't leave work until I've produced one hundred 'bi'" to compete with Machines No. 1 and No. 3. The workers' enthusiasm for labor was even higher, and both hands and eyes were focused on the machine, racing against the machine wheels. Cui Hu, one of the three heroes of the factory, used all his strength and was covered in sweat while stirring the large wheel, and people praised him as "fierce as a tiger in pushing the big wheel." Under the slogan "Start the machine and charge forward," they achieved an unprecedented output of 35,120 packs in one day, exceeding the standard output by 45.2%, more than doubling it compared to before the competition; under the efforts of team leader Yang Yuting, the output of Machine No. 3 reached 6,560 packs, exceeding the standard by 105%; under the leadership of team leader Gao Lintai, the output of Machine No. 1 reached as much as 8,000 packs per day. They achieved amazing results. The sharp increase in output made them very confident and said, "Can't we snatch the flag back?!"

　　The packaging team, determined to capture the flag, certainly did not dare to slack off in the intense battle to grab the flag. "The cigarette rolling team is producing more than 30,000 packs of cigarettes today, are we willing to lose face?" As soon as team leader Song Bingquan issued this call, the upsurge of the overtime competition immediately stirred up in the packaging team.

　　The female workers proposed: "Don't let a single cigarette be left, we won't leave work until we finish packaging." The playful child laborers even worked overtime without resting for half a week; female worker Ji Qiufeng produced while sick, packaging 1,300 packs of cigarettes; new apprentice Wang Zengxian increased his daily output from 800 packs to 1,400 packs, an increase of 70%. On "June 1st" Children's Day, they worked as usual and worked overtime for one and a half hours. Eating a meal, running back and forth from the workshop to the cafeteria, only took ten minutes. The high level of labor enthusiasm resulted in an output of 38,179 packs, breaking the unprecedented record, which was two times higher than the output before the competition. Therefore, these kids proudly said, "It's certain that we'll hang the flag!"

　　The entire factory's emotions were absorbed by the intense flag-grabbing battle between the cigarette rolling and packaging teams, and everyone's eyes were focused on them, but no one was willing to lag behind, and everyone wanted to take the lead, making the movement of overtime and increasing production widespread to every production unit in the factory.

　　夺旗战
    大兴烟草公司二厂工作竞赛
    简朴
    自从总结“二七”竞赛的劳模大会以后，在迎接“五一”的大竞赛中，全厂洋溢着“人人逞英雄，个个抖威风”，“生产节约快立功，功上加功更光荣”的立功歌声。
    由胜而败的机卷组技师王立中受到贺经理“怎么搞的？旗帜没掌握好，叫人家理叶组夺走了”的质问；又遭到包装组长宋炳全“为什么包的少？你们机卷组不出烟，怨谁”的反而急得跳起来说：“俺要不把烟出到三万包，那包装组堆着包不完就不姓王了”。全组工友都不服气，蹩着劲要来个一鸣惊人的吓吓战果。在“把旗帜抢回来”的斗争目标下，涌现出许多惊人的伟绩。
    他们提出“任务不完，决不下工”口号后，在工务股办公室里，每天许多工友就自愿请求加工。搅轮工人张涣成、富昌等曾连续一昼两夜三个班做了三十一小时的工作，坚持不下工。过去，在工作时盼着到点早下工；现在，等接班者到工房催着交班才下工，虽然每班加工一点到一点半，但仍不满意。工人王留锁说：“白班到天黑才下工，咱不到明天早饭后不交班”。在这种争先恐后的加工斗争中，工友们整天在唱着：“亚赛梁山将，个个逞钢强，为了两万五（按：竞赛产量），加工机器房”。
    加工比赛，加工作时间由十小时作到十一小时至十一小时半，机器日以继夜的转动着。
    王技师亲自开二号机子，提出“不到一百篦不下工”与一、三号机比赛，工友们劳动热情更高了，两手与两眼都集中在机器上，和机轮赛跑。全厂三名英雄崔虎，用尽全身气力，满身大汗的在搅着大轮，人们夸之为“推动大轮猛如虎”。在“开动机器向前冲锋”口号下，获得了一日三万五千一百二十包之空前产量，超过标准产量百分之四十五点二，较之竞赛前增加了一倍以上；三号机产量，在组长杨玉廷努力下，竟达六千五百六十包，超过标准百分之一百零五；一号机在组长高林太领导下，竟达日产八千包之多。获得了惊人的战果。产量猛烈上涨，使他们十分自信的说：“旗帜还能夺不回”？！
    一心要夺取旗帜的包装组，在紧张的抢旗激战中，当然不敢怠慢。“机卷组今天出烟三万多包，咱们愿意丢人吗”？组长宋炳全这么一号召，加工竞赛的热潮，立刻就在包装组里激荡起来。
    女工们提出：“不让存一根烟，包不完，决不下工。”贪玩的童工们，连半礼拜也不休息在加工；女工冀秋风带病生产，包烟一千三百包；新学徒王增先从日产八百包提高到一千四百包，增加百分之七十。“四四”儿童节，照常工作，并加工一点半。吃一顿饭从工房到食堂，来回是跑步，只用十分钟。高度的劳动热忱，取得了三万八千一百七十九包的产量，打破空前纪录，与竞赛前的产量比较，提高了两倍。于是，这群小鬼们都骄傲的说：“挂旗帜是准的了！”
    全厂的情绪，被机卷、包装两组的抢旗激战吸住了，每一个人的眼睛都集中在他们的身上，但都不甘落后，谁也要抢先，使加工、增产的运动普遍到全厂每一个生产单位中。
