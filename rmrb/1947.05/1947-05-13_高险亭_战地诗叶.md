　　Gao Xianting
　　——Battlefield Poem
　　Ke Gang
　　Gao Xianting returned to the team sheepishly,
　　Only one person in the entire company said a word to him:
　　"You want a calf, but Chiang Kai-shek wants your head?!"
　　From then on, no one paid him any attention.
　　Every day, the company sang like this:
　　"Gao Xianting fell behind,
　　Heard that his family had turned things around,
　　Secretly went home to see the calf."
　
　　Strangely enough, this time he heard about defending Chairman Mao, and everyone wanted to perform meritorious service,
　　He also requested to charge forward.
　　He ran to the company headquarters:
　　"Company Commander! This time, let me go cut the barbed wire!"
　　The company commander shook his head and smiled.
　　He then spoke to the political instructor:
　　"Political Instructor! Please agree to let me go cut it!
　　I borrowed a chaff cutter and have been sharpening it for two days!"
　　The political instructor agreed to him.
　
　　Truly, on the night of April 1st,
　　Only his knife flashed,
　　On the edge of the enemy's group bunker,
　　Layers of barbed wire obstacles were all cut by him.
　　The next day, everyone raised their thumbs,
　　All said: Gao Xianting is truly glorious!
　　Everyone lifted him up and threw him straight into the sky.

　　高险亭
    ——战地诗叶
    柯岗
    高险亭羞羞答答归队啦，
    全连只有一个人和他说了一句话：
    “你想要小牛，老蒋想要你的头？！”
    从此谁也不理他。
    连里天天有人这样唱：
    “高险亭死落后，
    听说家里翻了身，
    偷偷回家看小牛。”
　
    真奇怪，这回他听说保卫毛主席，人人要立功，
    他也要求打冲锋。
    他跑到连部：
    “连长！这回叫我去砍铁丝网！”
    连长摇摇头，笑一笑。
    他又对住指导员：
    “指导员！请你答应我去砍！
    我借了一口铡刀，已经磨了两天！”
    指导员答应了他。
　
    真的，四月一号的夜晚，
    只有他刀光一闪，
    在敌人集团地堡的边沿，
    层层的铁刺障碍全被他斩断。
    第二天，人人伸着大姆指，
    都说：高险亭真光荣！
    大家把他抬起来直往天上扔。
