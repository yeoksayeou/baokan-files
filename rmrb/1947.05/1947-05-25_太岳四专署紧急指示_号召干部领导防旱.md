Taiyue Fourth Administrative Office Issues Emergency Instructions
    Calling on Cadres to Lead Drought Resistance Efforts
    [Our newspaper's Taiyue dispatch from the 23rd] The Fourth Administrative Office issued emergency instructions on the 17th, calling on cadres to perform meritorious service in drought resistance. The instructions pointed out that cadres at all levels should use various methods to overcome the masses' mentality of waiting for rain. They called on everyone to "Save one seedling is one seedling saved, saving one mu is a meritorious service, sitting and waiting for the sky is a disaster." Mobilize the masses to plant, weed seedlings, and repair old canals, water furrows, and old ponds. In areas near rivers, carry water to irrigate the land. If it rains, everyone should go to the fields together. They also called for turning over and airing stored grain, saving grain, and accumulating bran and vegetables. Yangcheng, Shimin and other counties have taken the lead in responding to this call. Wang Bingde, Wang Xufa, Jia Fuyu, and other three families in Shangping Village, Shimin, have started digging wells, planning to complete them in thirteen days, influencing Zhang Shichun and others to also dig wells. Xiaobeizhuang Village, Zhengzhuang, carried water to plant 72 mu of cotton. Under their influence, even those in Zhengzhuang who had been waiting for rain to plant have started planting. Jiafeng Village has planted all 627 mu of cotton in the village, 80 percent of which was planted by carrying water. After breaking the mentality of waiting for rain, they rushed to plant 541 mu of millet and 84.5 mu of peanuts. The Yangcheng County government has arranged drought prevention and famine preparation work, proposing to immediately organize able-bodied men and women, and semi-able-bodied laborers to carry water for planting and replanting small seedlings, as well as repairing canals and digging wells to fight the drought. Shangguan Zhongyou, a labor hero from Yanshan Village in the Sixth District, has started carrying water to plant corn and replant small seedlings, and has taken out the wild vegetables collected during last year's famine preparation to turn them over and air them, preparing for famine. Bai Rusai, a female hero from Lujiahe, has organized 46 young women (approximately 75 percent of the village's women), 12 older children, and 17 younger children to weed the seedlings in advance.

    【本报太岳二十三日电】四专署于十七日发出紧急指示，号召干部防旱立功。指示指出各级干部应用各种各样办法克服群众等雨思想。号召大家“救活一苗是一苗，救活一亩立功劳，坐等老天糟大糕”。动员群众点种、锄苗修复旧渠水垄，旧池，靠河地区担水浇地，如遇落雨一齐上地。并号召翻晒存粮，节省粮食积存糠菜。阳城士敏等县已首先响应这一号召，士敏坪上村王秉德、王绪发、贾福裕等三家已开工打井，计划十三天完成，影响张世椿等也要打井。郑庄属村小北庄担水点种棉花七十二亩，在他们影响下连郑庄一直等雨下种的人也开始点种起来。贾峰村把全村六百二十七亩棉花全部种完，其中有百分之八十都是担水点种的，又在打破等雨思想之后，突击种谷五百四十一亩，种花生八十四亩半。阳城县政府布置防旱备荒工作，提出马上组织男女全半劳力担水点种与补种小苗，并修渠打井和天旱作斗争。六区岩山村劳动英雄上官中有已开始担水点种玉茭，补种小苗，并把去年备荒时采集的野菜拿出来翻晒，作备荒打算，芦家河女英雄白如赛已组织青年妇女四十六人（约占全村妇女百分之七十五）大儿童十二人，小儿童十七人提前锄苗。
