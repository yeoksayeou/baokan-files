Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd: According to various reports, on the 20th, a joint demonstration and parade by students from sixteen colleges and universities in the Nanjing, Shanghai, Suzhou, and Hangzhou areas to save the education crisis was brutally suppressed by Chiang Kai-shek's army, police, secret agents, and led to a bloody massacre. At 9:00 AM on the 20th, students, disregarding Chiang Kai-shek's bloody order of suppression, gathered in Zhongda Square and set off for a demonstration and parade, and to petition the Chiang-controlled参政会 (National Political Council). Participants included the Shanghai-Hangzhou student petition delegation, students from Zhongda (Central University), Teachers College, National Yingshi University, National Social Education College, etc., shouting slogans along the way such as "Increase education funding!" "Public funds should be adjusted with prices!" "Oppose the civil war!" "Resume peace talks with the CCP!" "Stop conscription!" "We don't want to starve to death because of the civil war!" etc. When the student ranks reached Drum Tower, Jinling University students arrived to join them, forming a massive torrent of more than 6,000 people. Armed police fired to stop the Jinling University students, but the students were not afraid. They turned from Drum Tower to Zhongshan Road and Linsen Road, advancing towards the National Political Council. Reaching Zhujiang Road intersection, the military police formed a dense line, blocking the way, and charged and beat the students, using water cannons to spray them, knocking many students to the ground and injuring them. At that time, the students linked arms and ran to break through the blockade line. Another group of students was brutally beaten by the police in Lujia Lane and Hanjia Lane, with broken ribs, blinded eyes, and even deaths. Under this barbaric oppression, the students also seized water cannons and bravely resisted with slogan-writing ink cans and demonstration flagpoles. The Chiang-controlled Garrison Headquarters issued so-called "dissolution orders" twice, but the students ignored them. Despite the rain, the students stood firm and stayed in the rain, and propagated to the citizens on the spot, saying: "Why don't you have rice? Because your rice has been swallowed by guns and cannons!" etc. The students also insisted on sending representatives to the National Political Council to petition, and handed the petition to Shao Lizi, the Secretary-General of the Chiang-controlled National Political Council, asking him to forward it to the Chiang-controlled National Political Council and the Chiang government. At the same time, they demanded the withdrawal of all military police who obstructed and oppressed the students, and made a serious protest against the bloody incident, demanding compensation, aftercare, and other issues. At 6:55 PM, they returned to Zhongda, and the parade ended.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd: According to various reports, on May 20th, simultaneously with the Nanjing bloodbath, a major tragedy of Chiang's bandits slaughtering and suppressing the student movement also occurred in Tianjin. However, the nationwide student strikes, parades, and demonstrations against civil war and hunger broke through this brutal suppression and advanced wave upon wave, becoming increasingly widespread. According to a TASS report from Nanjing on the 21st, on May 20th, 15,000 students from various schools in Tianjin demonstrated under the slogan "Civil war will destroy China," and were attacked by more than 100 Chiang Kai-shek secret agents, and gunfire broke out. According to statistics, more than 40 students were massacred, 70 were arrested and missing, and the streets are now full of secret agents from the so-called "Alliance to Suppress Riots." These people are wearing uniforms and carrying rifles, and the city is completely in chaos with constant gunfire in the streets. The bloodbaths in Beijing and Tianjin immediately agitated students across the country. According to the Central News Agency, student representatives from Zhongda held an emergency meeting on the afternoon of the 21st to protest the brutality of Chiang's military police and resolved to: (1) Organize a "May 20th" Bloodbath Handling Committee; (2) Demand that the Garrison Headquarters be responsible for the medical expenses of injured students, the government provide compensation for deceased students, and relevant authorities investigate and release arrested students within five hours; (3) Continue to demand an increase in food subsidies, and resolutely not resume classes until the goal is achieved; (4) Publish letters to compatriots across the country and to people around the world; (5) Authorize the student union to refute any distorted reports on the "May 20th" bloodbath. Various schools in Shanghai held emergency meetings that night to discuss emergency actions. Schools in Beijing and Tianjin also decided to call on students nationwide to resolutely hold a national general strike on June 2nd. To protest Chiang's bandits' atrocities, the Agricultural College and Medical College in Hankou also began strikes the day after the bloodbath (May 21st). Students from Zhongzheng University in Nanchang gathered in the city on the morning of the 21st for parades and demonstrations, and some students marched to Nanjing to petition, and had already reached Jiujiang waiting for ships.

　　蒋党惨杀京津学生全国学潮愈趋猛烈
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】据各方报导：二十日，南京京沪苏杭区十六个专科以上学校学生之挽救教育危机联合示威大游行，遭蒋家军警宪特残酷镇压，至演成流血惨案。二十日上午九时，学生不顾蒋介石镇压的血腥命令，齐集中大广场，出发游行示威，并赴蒋记参政会请愿。参加者有沪杭区学生请愿团、中大、师范学院、国立英士大学、国立社会教育学院……等，沿途高呼“提高教育经费！”“公费随物价调整！”“反对内战！”“与中共恢复和平谈判！”“停止征兵！”“我们不愿因内战饿死了！”……等口号。学生行列抵鼓楼时，金大学生即赶到汇合，构成六千余人之巨大洪流。武装警察为阻止金大学生，曾开枪射击，但学生毫不畏惧，自鼓楼折向中山路、林森路，向参政会会场前进。进抵珠江路口时，宪警以密集队形一字排开，阻住去路，向学生冲打，并以水龙向学生扫射，不少学生倒地受伤。当时学生即互挽臂膀以跑步冲过封锁线，另一部分学生在陆家巷与韩家巷遭警察凶殴，有被打断肋骨，打瞎眼睛并致死者。学生在此种横蛮压迫下，亦抢夺水龙，并以写标语之油墨罐及示威用之旗杆等勇敢抵抗。蒋记卫戍司令部两度颁发所谓“解散令”，学生均置之不理。时值降雨，学生仍鹄立雨中不散，并就地向市民宣传称：“你们为什么没有米？因为你们的米叫枪炮吞去了！”等。学生又坚持派代表前往参政会请愿，当以请愿书交予蒋记参政会秘书长邵力子，请其转交蒋记参政会及蒋政府。同时要求撤走一切阻挠压迫学生之军警，及对其造成血案严重抗议，要求赔偿、善后等各项问题。六时五十五分，返抵中大，游行乃告结束。
    【新华社陕北廿三日电】综合各方报导：五月二十日与南京血案同时，天津亦发生蒋贼屠杀镇压学生运动的大惨案。但全国学生反内战反饥饿的罢课游行示威运动，冲破这种残酷镇压前仆后继，愈趋扩大。据塔斯社南京二十一日电称：五月二十日，天津各校学生一万五千人在“内战将毁灭中国”的口号下示威游行，遭蒋家百余特务袭击，一时枪声大作。据统计：被惨杀学生达四十余人，被逮捕失踪者七十余人，现街头满布所谓“镇压暴动联盟”的特务。这些人穿着制服，带着步枪，市面已完全陷入混乱状态，街头枪声不绝。京津两地血案发生后，立即激动了全国各地学生。据中央社透露：中大学生代表为抗议蒋家宪警的暴行，于二十一日下午，开临时会议，决议：（一）组织“五·二○”血案处理委员会；（二）要求受伤同学之医药费由卫戍司令部负责，死亡同学由政府抚恤，被捕同学由有关机关于五小时内查明释放；（三）继续要求增加副食费，不达目的决不复课；（四）发表告全国同胞书，告全世界人士书。（五）以后凡对于“五·二○”血案有意歪曲之报导，授权学生自治会驳斥之。上海各校于当日晚即召开紧急会议，商讨紧急行动办法。平津各校也决定号召全国学生坚决于六月二日举行全国总罢课。为了抗议蒋贼这次暴行，汉口农学院、医学院两校也于血案之次日（二十一日）起开始罢课。南昌之中正大学学生，二十一日晨即群集向市区游行示威，并有一部分学生徒步赴京请愿，已进抵九江候船。
