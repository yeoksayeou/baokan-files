　　Carrying More, Walking Faster
    Postal Workers Launch Competition
    The postal workers at each station were extremely enthusiastic upon receiving the order. At ×× station, the administration and the workers' union immediately organized mobilization. During discussions, everyone clarified three concepts: (1) Implementing night shifts is to increase speed and strengthen communication between the front and rear, which is to support the war more effectively. Delivering newspapers and letters quickly, and promptly disseminating victory news, has the same important effect as annihilating the enemy at the front. (2) Walking at night is fighting against nature, and has the same value as fighting the enemy desperately at the front. (3) Guaranteeing the night shift is making a contribution to the people. We are the working class, and we should play a exemplary role, learn from other model worker brothers, and launch a friendly competition. Postal worker Zhao Xiaosan said, "In the past, I was a hired hand, suffering for the landlord. Now I'm working for myself, I must exert myself, carrying 70 jin [35 kg], walking 12 li [6 km] in one hour" (carrying 10 jin more than others). Cook Lian Ainiu said, "If any young person is afraid to walk at night, I can replace them." Following this, Liu Dacheng and five others all responded to the call of the superiors and started running night shifts.

　　担得多走得快
    邮工发起竞赛
    各站邮工接到命令后情绪极高，××站，行政与职工会马上组织动员，大伙讨论中，明确了三个观念：（一）实行夜班是为了增快速度，使前后方联系密切，是为着更有力地支援战争；把报纸、信件送得快，及时传播胜利消息，收得效果和前方歼灭敌人一样重要。（二）夜间走路，要与自然作斗争，和前方与敌人拚命一样有价值。（三）保证了夜班就是给人民立下功劳，咱们是工人阶级，应起模范作用，向其他模范工人兄弟们学习，开展友谊的竞赛。邮工赵小三说：“我过去住长工，是给老财受，现在给自己干，一定要卖气力，担七十斤，一点钟走十二里”（比别人多担十斤）。炊事员连爱牛说：“年轻人谁夜间不敢走路我可代替”。接着刘大成等六人都先后响应上级号召，跑起了夜班。
