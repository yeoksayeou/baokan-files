　　Neiqiu Townspeople Carry Water to Plant Cotton
    Planting must not wait for rain - Eating must not depend on heaven
    County Head Takes the Lead - Personally Carries Water
    [Report from this newspaper] After the conclusion of the Neiqiu Town District village cadre expansion meeting, the path to prosperity was clarified. Upon returning to the villages, they combined the resolution of the masses' ideological concerns with the formal commencement of spring planting. Seasonally speaking, the timing for planting cotton was urgent, but the masses harbored the idea of waiting for rain before planting, believing that it was not too late to wait. At that time, the cadres and activists of each street, seeing this situation, raised questions at the people's school such as "Can we plant if it doesn't rain? Is it acceptable to not rely on heaven for food?". After discussion, everyone unanimously proposed carrying water to plant, not relying on or waiting for heaven to eat. Now each street has generally started planting, forming a planting cotton fervor. All male and female semi-auxiliary laborers in the East Street organized 95% of their strength to conduct a cotton planting blitz. As of the morning of the 29th, statistics showed that 122 mu had been completed. The Li Qun group, consisting of three male laborers and five female laborers, with the men carrying water and the women digging holes and planting, had completed ten mu. They plan to plant 300 mu even if it doesn't rain. The Tian Changqiu group, consisting of four full laborers, five half laborers, and fifteen auxiliary laborers, completed 29 mu in three days by plowing and harrowing alternately. Cao Renzeng of this group, only eleven years old, was considered a small model in the group's planting efforts. In the planting efforts, the West Street conducted research and calculations. The method is: one root every two and a half feet, planting every other row. Each load of water can irrigate ten to twelve pits. After the water soaks in, plant five or six seeds in each pit and cover with your foot. After one or two days, rake it once with a short-toothed rake. This also makes it drought-resistant and ensures accuracy. Zhao Qingyi's group of sixteen people planted thirteen mu in two days, entirely by carrying water. They have now completed 46.8 mu. The West Gate has completed 54.8 mu, and the South Street has also completed 28 mu. A fervor for carrying water to plant has formed in each street of the town, and nearly 400 mu of cotton fields have been sown in three days. This movement is still continuing.

    [Another Report] Neiqiu County Head Lu led 32 cadres and miscellaneous personnel from the entire county government to carry water to plant cotton outside the West Gate. Under the leadership of County Head Lu, eight mu of cotton were planted in one afternoon, and everyone's spirits were high. (Neiqiu Mass Small Newspaper)

　　内邱城关担水点棉
    该种地不能等雨  要吃饭不能靠天
    县长带头  亲自挑水
    【本报讯】内邱城关区村干部扩大会结束以后，明确了发家致富的道路，回村后结合着解决群众的思想圪塔，即正式开展春耕生产。按季节来说明该种棉花的紧迫时机，可是群众在思想上却存在着等天下雨再种的思想，认为时间还不晚等。当时各街干部积极分子，看到这种情况后，在民校提出了“天不下雨是否能种？不靠天吃饭沾不沾”等问题，大家讨论后，一致提出了担水点种，不靠天不等天吃饭。现各街已普遍点种起来，形成了种棉热潮，东街所有之男女全半辅助劳力组织起百分之九十五进行了点棉突击，截止二十九日上午统计：已完成了一二二亩。李群组三个男劳力，五个女劳力，男子担水，妇女刨坑点种，已完成十亩。计划不下雨也要种够三百亩。田长秋组四个全劳力、五个半劳力、十五个辅助劳力、连耕代耙三天完成二九亩，该组曹仁增才十一岁，在全组点种中被认为小模范。西街在点种中，进行了研究和计算，办法是：二尺半远一根、隔一垅点一垅，每担水能浇十个坑到十二个坑，待水渗下后、每窑中点五、六个籽，用脚埋住，待一、两天再用短齿耙耙一遍，这样也耐旱，成的也准。赵清义全组十六人两天点种十三亩，完全是担水点，现已完成四十六亩八分。西关已完成五十四亩八分，南街也完成二八亩，在城关各街已形成了担水点种的热潮，三天完成近四百亩的棉田下种，现这一运动仍在继续开展中。（内邱大众小报）
