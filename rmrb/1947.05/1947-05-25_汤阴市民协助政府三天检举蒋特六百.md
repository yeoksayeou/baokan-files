Xinhua News Agency, Northern Henan Front, 23rd: The citizens of Tangyin are actively assisting the democratic government in eliminating the remaining forces of Chiang Kai-shek and his puppet regime. During the "Three Nos Movement" (no hiding of Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents and despots, no hiding of Chiang Kai-shek's weapons, no hiding of Chiang Kai-shek's materials), they exposed and automatically captured 636 hidden Chiang Kai-shek secret agents and scattered soldiers within three days. Sun Dianying's collaborators, the bandit leaders of Lin County and Jun County, were all exposed. One woman reported a Chiang Kai-shek officer hiding in her home and accused the officer of forcing her to go to the democratic government and admit that he was her husband, a shameless act. Citizens have automatically delivered more than 100 rifles to the democratic government, as well as 7 machine guns, 12 pistols, and more than 10,000 rounds of ammunition.

　　Our correspondent from the Northern Henan Front, 22nd: Under the active support of our democratic government, the citizens of Tangyin are gradually prospering, and the market for American goods is gradually transforming into a market for local goods. During the rule of Chiang Kai-shek and his puppet regime, American kerosene, electrical materials, cigarettes, fabrics, and other cosmetics flooded the market, and the customers were mostly Chiang Kai-shek personnel who exploited the people. Now, vegetable oil and native cloth from the liberated areas have been transported in large quantities, and cigarettes, vermicelli, starch sheets, coal from Anyang Shuiye Town, iron farm tools from the Southeast Shanxi region, and native porcelain from Ci County are pouring in, transforming the market. The Bureau of Industry and Commerce regularly introduces market conditions in various places to merchants. The materials entering the city from the old liberated areas are generally sold to merchants at prices 20% to 35% lower than the market price. Therefore, the prices of daily necessities for the people are gradually decreasing. The democratic government has announced the abolition of excessive taxes, which has overjoyed the merchants and the people. The exorbitant and heavy nature of Chiang Kai-shek's taxes was appalling. Last year alone, he extorted a staggering 36 million yuan from 250 "in-business" shopkeepers. Therefore, the general lament of businessmen about their fate during the rule of Chiang Kai-shek was: "Business is for others to do." Now, these heavy burdens have been lifted under the leadership of the democratic government.

　　汤阴市民协助政府三天检举蒋特六百
    【新华社豫北前线二十三日电】汤阴市民积极协助民主政府，肃清蒋伪残余势力。他们在不藏蒋伪特务恶霸，不藏蒋伪武器，不藏蒋伪物资的“三不运动”中，三天内检举并自动捕捉隐藏的蒋伪特务和散兵六百三十六人，孙逆殿英勾结的林县、浚县土匪头子，都被检举出来，一个女人检举藏在她家的一个蒋伪军官，并控诉该军官强行要她去民主政府承认是她丈夫的无耻行为。市民自动送到民主政府的步枪已达百余支，并有机枪七挺、短枪十二支、子弹万余发。
    【本报豫北前线廿二日电】汤阴在我民主政府积极扶持下，市民逐渐繁荣，美货市场逐渐转变为土货市场。在蒋伪统治时，美国煤油、电料、纸烟、布匹及其他化装品充溢市面，顾客多为压榨人民的蒋伪人员，现解放区的植物油、土布已大批运到，安阳水冶镇的纸烟、粉条、粉皮、煤炭，及晋东南地区的铁制农具，磁县的土磁器等源源输入，市面一改旧观。工商管理局经常向商人介绍各地行情，老区进入该城的物资一般都要低于市价百分之二十到卅五批给商家。因此人民日用必需品价格逐渐下降。民主政府已宣布废除苛杂，商民欢喜若狂，蒋家捐税之苛重，骇人听闻，去年一年中竟向二百五十户“在行”坐商榨取三千六百万元之巨，故一般商人之感叹在蒋伪统治期间的命运说：“生意是给人家忙的。”如今这些惨重负担，已在民主政府领导下得到解除了。
