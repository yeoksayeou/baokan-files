Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 15th—On the fiercely contested front lines of northern Shaanxi, the Northwest People's Liberation Army is still seizing gaps in the fighting to help the masses with production. The Political Department issued an instruction on "Doing Everything Possible to Help with Spring Planting," calling on the troops to protect the masses' production on the one hand and to extract manpower and animal power as much as possible to provide assistance, and on the other hand, to minimize the mobilization of manpower and animal power, and strictly prohibit arbitrary requisitioning without going through the government. Cadres of the Political Department immediately helped with production in the villages where they were stationed. An old farmer named Feng in one village had his oxen slaughtered by the Jiang-Hu troops, so two cadres helped him dig the land with hoes. Village head Wang Si was busy with work, so the cadres helped him prepare fertilizer. Because the Jiang-Hu troops were slaughtering oxen and destroying farm implements everywhere, after the PLA cadres and soldiers publicized and encouraged the people and provided concrete help, the masses all said: "They really are Chairman Mao's army, fighting on the one hand and worrying about the people's production on the other." The morale of the masses has gradually increased. With the help of the troops, villages in the front-line area are busily plowing and fertilizing the land, and many families have already planted millet.

　　陕北前线部队帮助群众下种
    【新华社西北十五日电】在激烈战斗的陕北前线，西北人民解放军仍抓紧战争空隙帮助群众生产。政治部曾发出“全力帮助春耕”的指示，号召部队一面掩护群众生产，并尽可能抽出人力畜力进行帮助，一面尽量减少人畜力动员，严禁不经过政府自由派差。政治部干部当即帮助驻村生产，该村一冯姓老农耕牛被蒋胡军宰食，两个干部即用锄帮助他挖地，村长王四忙于工作，干部们就帮他捣粪，蒋胡军到处残杀耕牛，破坏农具，经解放军干部战士宣传鼓励与具体帮助后，群众均说：“到底是毛主席的军队，一面打仗，一面还操心百姓的生产。”群众情绪遂亦逐渐提高。前线一带村庄在部队帮助下，正纷纷耕地上粪，不少人家谷子皆已下种。
