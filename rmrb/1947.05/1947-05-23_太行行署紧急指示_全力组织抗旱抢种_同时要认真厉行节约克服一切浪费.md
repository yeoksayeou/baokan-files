　　Taihang Administrative Office Issues Urgent Instructions:
    Go All Out to Organize Drought Resistance and Rush Planting
    While Seriously Practicing Economy and Overcoming All Waste
    [Our Taihang Dispatch, 21st] With spring ending without rain, drought is developing. The Taihang Administrative Office specifically issued instructions on May 13th, calling on all localities to immediately adopt effective measures to fight against the drought. 1. Immediately carry out a concentrated rush to plant and sow. No region is an exception. Missing the opportunity will make remedy impossible. It is required that leaders in various regions take responsibility, and everyone should take action to create a movement. The spirit of Nei Qiu County Magistrate Lu personally leading county government cadres to carry water for planting is worthy of praise. 2. Focus on rush planting, ensuring production. Every piece of land and every seedling is precious. Making even a little more progress will increase the role of the struggle against famine and the self-defense war. Cadres in various regions should promote the spirit of responsibility to the people and make contributions to the people in the fight against drought. 3. The biggest problem in current production is resolving the difficulty of labor and animal power. In addition to organizing a large number of auxiliary laborers to participate in the blitz, all forces that can be used for rush planting and sowing should suspend other activities and focus on the blitz. For example, the cadres of 66 cooperatives in the fourth district of Heshun participate in production during the day and business at night. 1,400 spinners, 920 children, and 300 head of livestock have all suspended seven days of spinning, classes, and transportation, and completed all planting. This is a good practice. All agencies, schools, troops, and shops can automatically help the local masses with planting. 4. In terms of technical guidance, agricultural and forestry bureaus and county farms should better integrate with the masses and create more methods to combat drought. Local technical committees should study methods for drought-resistant planting. Finally, we must also earnestly practice economy and overcome all waste, and save every possible penny.
    [Our Taihang Dispatch, 21st] The Third Administrative Office of Taihang again urgently instructed various counties to immediately launch a drought prevention and famine preparedness campaign, and go all out to rush spring plowing and planting. The instruction emphasizes: Under the efforts of all cadres and the masses, spring plowing and planting in the entire region has formed a climax, but due to the dry weather and lack of labor, sowing has been affected in some places. Leading comrades at all levels must not ignore or delay sowing work, otherwise it will cause a serious famine. It also calls for immediately mobilizing the broad masses to launch a drought prevention, saving, and famine preparedness movement, organizing all possible full and semi-labor forces, men and women, those who can plant should rush to plant, and those who cannot should carry water for planting. This work should be listed as the current central task, and all cadres should be organized to go deep into the villages to specifically organize and promote it. Technical expertise should still be emphasized during sowing, and care should be taken not to be sloppy and finish planting.
    [Our Neiqiu Dispatch] Neiqiu County Government calls for emergency drought prevention and famine preparedness: 1. Organize mutual assistance in drilling wells, digging wells, repairing pools, and repairing canals to use all the water conservancy facilities in each village for watering wheat and planting, planting one more plant, and watering one more plant to harvest one more plant. 2. County and district cadres at all levels should quickly educate the masses and mobilize them to prevent drought and prepare for famine in the campaign to perform meritorious service. In terms of food, clothing, and use, there should be plans and plans, and usable substitutes such as wild jujube bran vegetables should be preserved to prevent any possible famine. 3. In addition to using water conservancy for planting, organize the masses to dry plant and wet emerge, which can solve the difficulty of labor and animal power during rush planting after rain.

　　太行行署紧急指示
    全力组织抗旱抢种
    同时要认真厉行节约克服一切浪费
    【本报太行二十一日电】春尽未雨，旱象已成，太行行署特于五月十三日颁发指示，号召各地立刻采取有效办法，向天旱作斗争。一、立即进行突击抢种点种，任何地区都毫不例外，错过时机便无法补救。要求各地首长负责，大家动手，造成运动。内邱吕县长亲自领导县府干部担水点种的精神，值得表扬。二、突击抢种，保障生产，一分地一苗庄稼都是宝贵的，多作一分成绩，即给灾荒斗争自卫战争多起一分作用。各地干部要发扬为人民负责精神，在和旱灾作斗争中为民立功。三、目前生产中最大的问题，是解决劳畜力的困难，除大量组织辅助劳力参加突击外，一切可能运用于突击抢种、点种的力量，暂停别的活动，全力突击。如和顺四区六十六个合作社的干部，白天参加生产，黑夜再作营业，一千四百个纺妇，九百二十个儿童，三百头牲口，都停止七天纺织、上课、运输，完成了全部下种，这是很好的做法。各机关、学校、部队、商店，都可自动的帮助所在地群众下种。四、技术指导上，各农林局及县农场，要更多的结合群众，创造更多的与旱灾作斗争的办法。各地技术委员会要研究抗旱点种的办法。最后，我们还要认真厉行节约，克服一切浪费，要做到能节约一文即节约一文。
    【本报太行廿一日电】太行三专署再次紧急指示各县，立即开展防旱备荒运动，全力突击春耕下种。该指示着重说明：全区春耕下种在所有干部和群众的努力下已形成高潮，但由于天旱无雨，劳力缺乏，某些地方已影响到下种，各级领导同志万勿忽视与迟缓下种工作，否则将会造成严重灾荒；并立即动员广大群众开展防旱节约备荒运动，组织一切可能组织的男女全半劳力，能种者抢种，不能种者担水点种。这一工作应列为当前中心工作，组织所有干部深入乡村具体组织推动，下种时仍应讲求技术，万不要粗糙种完了事。
    【本报内邱讯】内邱县府号召紧急防旱备荒：一、组织起来互助打井掏井修池修渠，把各村所有的水利都用到浇麦子下种上边，种上一棵多一棵，浇活一棵多收一棵。二、县区各级干部在立功运动中迅速教育群众动员起来防旱备荒，在吃穿用各方面要有计划有打算，要把能用的代食品酸枣糠菜等保存起来，防备万一的灾荒。三、除用水利下种外，组织群众干种湿出，可以解决雨后抢种时劳畜力的困难。（峰山）
