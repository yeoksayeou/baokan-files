Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 19th—In coordination with the military and civilian counterattacks in various parts of northern Jiangsu, a "choosing the path" movement was launched against local Chiang Kai-shek puppets in April. Up to now, more than 2,400 out of over 5,000 local Chiang Kai-shek puppets in five counties, including Yeting, Huai'an, Liandong, and Funing, have fled. The democratic government pointed out in its announcements three paths to survival (returning home, going to southern Jiangsu, secretly working for the people) and one path to death (resolutely reactionary), allowing them to choose between life and death, which has been very effective. This movement is also combined with land re-investigation. Except for a few extremely reactionary local Chiang Kai-shek puppets, they are still given the land they deserve. This move greatly exceeded their expectations, so a large number of them fled from the strongholds and truly "returned home" to production. Sheyang County also set up a "Welcome General Station," distributing "Welcome Home Certificates," and those who come back with the certificates receive preferential treatment from the General Station. Currently, all Chiang Kai-shek strongholds in northern Jiangsu are in a state of panic all day long. All thirty-eight members of the returning home corps in Tianqiao Township have run away.

　　苏北我军展开政攻瓦解土著蒋伪二千
    【新华社华中十九日电】苏北各地配合军民反击，四月份内对七著蒋伪展开“择路”运动，迄今叶挺、淮安、涟（水）东、阜宁等五县五千余土著蒋伪中已有二千四百余名逃散。民主政府在广告中指出其三条生路（回家、下江南、暗中为人民办事），一条死路（即坚决反动），欲生欲死，任其选择，收效甚大。此一运动又与土地复查相结合。土著蒋伪除少数极反动者外，仍留予应得之土地。此举大出他们意料之外，因而大批逃出据点，真正“还乡”生产。射阳县亦设立“欢迎总站”，散发“欢迎归来证”，携证来归者受总站优待。现苏北各蒋据点终日惶惶不安，田桥乡三十八个还乡团员全部跑光。
