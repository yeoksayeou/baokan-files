Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, May 9th: TASS Moscow dispatch: *Izvestia* recently published an article titled "Inaccurate Facts" commenting on Marshall's broadcast speech, pointing out: The speech attempts to make the Soviet delegation responsible for the results of the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Meeting. Marshall distorted the Soviet delegation's attitude and suggestions. In discussing the issue of Germany's national institutions, Marshall's statement appeared to be that the Soviet Union supports extreme centralization of Germany and the establishment of a so-called "government that could very easily turn into something similar to a Nazi regime." In fact, Molotov's proposal to the Foreign Ministers' Meeting was to establish a democratic and unified German provisional government. It should not be ignored that Germany has already begun to move along the path of democratic development, and the success of this development should be the best guarantee to prevent the restoration of the Nazi regime. Conversely, a national institution based on any form of feudalism (note: i.e., the "federalization" advocated by the United States) would result in the danger of a new Bismarck or Hitler appearing. Marshall intentionally misplaces responsibility on this issue. Marshall said that the Soviet Union refused to cooperate in establishing a balanced German economy and did not take measures to achieve the economic unity stipulated in the Potsdam Agreement, as if the economic merger of the British and American occupation zones was forced by Soviet policy. As is well known, it was the Soviet Union that firmly advocated the resolution to achieve economic unity. The economic merger of the British and American occupation zones is precisely a policy aimed at splitting Germany politically and economically. Many facts were cited at the Foreign Ministers' Meeting proving the Soviet Union's efforts to complete the economic and political unification of Germany in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. Regarding the Four-Power Treaty for the elimination of German militarism, Marshall believes that the Soviet Union's amendments to the American draft are superfluous. And said: The Soviet government does not need such a treaty, or tries to withdraw it immediately when it sees that the treaty may be passed. In fact, anyone who studies the discussion of the draft of the Four-Power Treaty for the elimination of German militarism will undoubtedly understand that the Soviet government attaches great importance to this treaty. The Soviet Union not only wants to sign such a treaty, but also believes that this treaty should be a real guarantee for eliminating German militarism and preventing the resurgence of German aggression, rather than a formal act intended to please public opinion. However, the American draft cannot provide the guarantees stipulated in the Crimean and Berlin Conference resolutions. The American draft stipulates that the occupation of Germany will be terminated after Germany accepts the relevant provisions of the draft prohibiting military organizations and military plans, which is a complete violation of the Crimean Declaration and the Potsdam Resolution. Marshall arbitrarily said that the Soviet government believes that German assets in Austria transferred to the Soviet Union as compensation should include property taken from Austrian or United Nations citizens by Hitler or the Nazi government by force or illegal coercion after March 1938. In fact, the Soviet delegation has resolutely opposed and will resolutely oppose the distortion of German assets in Austria, so that those Austrian or non-Austrian property owners who colluded with the Germans after the German-Austrian merger and transferred their property to Hitler's followers to gain huge profits can still enjoy these properties today. Speaking of the Polish-German border, Marshall completely exposed the American delegation's attempt at the Foreign Ministers' Meeting to abandon the Potsdam Resolution and not return the territory of Poland formerly occupied by Germany to Poland. Obviously, the attitude of the US and British delegations in discussing the German issue is often determined by the narrow interests of certain monopoly groups, who regard Germany and even the whole of Europe as their exclusive investment scope. Naturally, this attitude cannot achieve a satisfactory solution to any complex problem facing it.

### 马歇尔演说恶意曲解外长会议事实  消息报著论痛予驳斥

　　马歇尔演说恶意曲解外长会议事实
    消息报著论痛予驳斥
    【新华社陕北九日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：消息报顷以“不符合事实”为题评马歇尔广播演说，指出：该演说企图使莫斯科外长会议工作之结果由苏联代表团负责。马氏曲解苏联代表团之态度与建议。在论及德国国家机构问题时，马歇尔的说法俨然是苏联拥护德国极端的集权和建立一个所谓“能够极其容易变为类似纳粹政体”的政府。事实上，莫洛托夫向外长会议提出的建议，是建立民主统一的德国临时政府。不应忽视德国已开始沿着民主发展的道路前进，此种发展之成功，应为制止纳粹政体恢复的最好保证。相反的，建基于封建主义任何形式上的那种国家机构（按：即美国主张的“联邦化”），结果会造成新的俾士麦、或希特勒出现之危险。马歇尔在此问题上，是将责任有意的误植了。马歇尔说苏联拒绝合作以建立德国之平衡经济，未采取措施来实现波茨顿决议所规定的经济统一。好像英美占领区经济合并是由于苏联政策所强迫出来的一样。如众周知，坚决主张实现经济统一之决议的正是苏联。英美占领区经济合并，恰好是一种目的，在于分裂德国政治与经济的政策。在外长会议上曾举出许多事实，证明苏联多方努力以完成遵照波茨顿决议之德国经济与政治的统一。关于清除德国军国主义的四强条约，苏联对美国草案的修正，马歇尔认为这是多余的。并且说：苏联政府不需要此种条约，或者企图一看到该条约有通过可能时就立刻想撤消它。事实上，无论何人只要研究一下对于清除德国军国主义四强条约草案的讨论，无疑的会明白苏联政府是极端重视这个条约的。苏联不仅要签订这样的条约，而且认为这个条约应该是清除德国军国主义和防止德国侵略再起的真正保证，而不是一种意图取悦舆论的形式法案。然而美国的草案不能给与克里米亚与柏林两会议决议中规定的保证。美国草案规定，在德国接受草案中禁止军事组织与军事计划的相当条款后，即停止对德国的占领，这是完全违反克里米亚宣言与波茨顿决议的。马歇尔武断的说，苏联政府认为作为赔偿而转移给苏联的德国在奥资产，要包括一九三八年三月后为希特勒或纳粹政府用强力或非法的胁迫取自奥国或联合国公民的财产。事实上，苏联代表团过去只是坚决反对、将来还要坚决反对对于德国在奥资产的曲解，致使那些在德奥合并以后曾与德人勾结并将财产移交希特勒党徒以获重利的奥国人或非奥国人的财产所有者，可以在今天仍然安享这些财产。谈到波德边界时，马歇尔完全暴露了美国代表团在外长会议上企图背弃波茨顿决议，不把德国以前占领波兰的领土归还波兰。显然的，美英代表团在讨论德国问题时的态度，常常是被决定于某些垄断集团的狭隘的利益，他们把德国甚至全欧洲都看做他们独占投资的范围。自然，这种态度是不能在面临着的任何复杂问题上获得圆满解决的。
