　　Hao Zhao Labor Hero Sets Example
    Promotes Crash Planting in the Whole Village
    [This newspaper's Shexian Dispatch] After attending the base point meeting, Zhao Fu-cheng, a labor hero from Hao Zhao Village, convened a meeting of emancipated peasant activists and proposed the slogan "Emancipation is uncovering the stone slab, prosperity still depends on production." Finally, everyone discussed crash spring plowing and planting, and decided to first plant millet on the slope land for the families of those participating in the war. That same evening, the original mutual aid groups were restored, totaling ten large groups, one hundred and eighty-two full laborers, seventy-four semi-laborers, and twenty-five livestock. With Zhao Nan-cheng's group as the backbone, a spring plowing and planting campaign was launched throughout the village. First, they planted more than 30 mu of slope millet, hoed 11 mu of wheat seedlings, and planted 106 melon mounds for four families participating in the war. Then, they concentrated their efforts on crash planting for the entire group, and now the planting work for the entire group has been completed. Influenced by them, the mutual aid groups in the whole village have become tense, and the whole village finished planting the land for 28 families participating in the war in one and a half days (more than 130 mu of slope millet, and 40 mu of plowed land planted with millet). In addition, they also took half a day to chop 15,000 catties of firewood and distributed it to 70 families of war participants and military families. In addition, 1,600 fruit trees were planted.

　　郝赵劳英起模范
    推动全村突击下种
    【本报涉县讯】郝赵村劳动英雄赵甫成，从基点开会回去后，召集了翻身农民积极分子会，提出“翻身是揭石板，发家还得靠生产”的口号，最后大家讨论突击春耕下种，决定先给参战家属种坡地谷子。当天晚上即将原有互助组恢复起来了，共十个大组，一百八十二个全劳力，七十四个半劳力，二十五个牲口，以赵南成组为骨干，开展了全村春耕下种运动。首先给四家参战的种坡谷三十多亩、锄麦苗十一亩，栽南瓜一百零六窑。然后集中力量给全组突击下种，现全组下种工作已全部完成。在他们影响下，全村互助组都紧张起来了，全村一天半就把二十八家参战的地都种完了（坡谷一百三十多亩，犁白地种谷四十亩），此外还抽出半天工夫打了一万五千斤柴，分给七十户参战家属与军属家，另外还栽了一千六百株果木树。（振华、振中、长庆）
