　　Elementary Schools in Taihang Actively Participate in Helping with Farming
　　[Reported from Taihang on the 11th of this month] Teachers and students of elementary schools in various parts of Taihang are actively helping the families of military personnel, martyrs, and those participating in the war with spring plowing. In Huguan Third Elementary School, teachers and students crammed three days' worth of lessons into two days to help with farming. Then, they all went to the fields together. The older students carried loads, the younger ones lifted, the older ones hoed field edges, and the younger ones broke up clods. More than ninety people delivered over a thousand loads of fertilizer, broke up over forty mu of clods, and hoed over forty zhang of field edges in one day. Zhanshang Village Elementary School in the Sixth District of Xiyang helps with farming after school every day; the relatively older students are divided into two groups, taking turns going to school and helping with farming, with those at school tutoring those helping with farming. High school teachers and students living in the village have also formed a 24-member work team, divided into three groups based on strength, each group with a leader and a scorekeeper. They start classes early and go to the fields after class, delivering 120 loads of fertilizer in four hours one day. Mabucun Elementary School in the Third District of Shexian studies in the morning and produces in the afternoon. More than two hundred male and female students organized twenty-six groups to help military families and participants in the war with hoeing field edges, breaking up clods, and providing drinking water. They delivered 1,500 pack-animal loads of fertilizer in six days, planning to deliver all the fertilizer within ten days. Children and teachers at Changcun School in Yuanshi have all joined in production. Female student Zhao Shuzhen went to gather firewood covered in scabies. When her classmates advised her not to go, she said, "I've suffered for several years. Now we're going to fight the enemy at our doorstep (Yuanshi City). I can't stay at home. If I can't gather much, I'll gather a little." On the 21st of last month, the Shangwangjing school district in the First District of Pingshun convened a meeting of elementary school teachers to specifically study ways to combine production and study. They all agreed that they should learn whatever they do. Children participating in production should form groups, each group making two small blackboards, taking turns learning to write new characters. When hoeing field edges, they should learn the three characters for "hoeing field edges." Teachers should uniformly arrange, guide, supervise, inspect, and test.
　　[News from Longping] Teachers and students staying at One Elementary School and students returning home for spring plowing are engaging in a production competition. The students returning home first challenged the teachers and students at the school, with the following conditions:
　　1. Guarantee to get up early and go to bed late, not afraid of hardship and not resting at noon when producing at home. 2. Do not forget propaganda and learning while producing, and insist on writing diaries. The teachers and students at the school also proposed: In addition to fulfilling the conditions proposed by the students returning home, they also guarantee to plant the twenty-one mu of spring land, fertilize one and a half mu of the campus, then plow it again and plant it, water the sixteen seedbeds twice, and fight sparrows and plant vegetables everywhere in the more than one mu courtyard.
