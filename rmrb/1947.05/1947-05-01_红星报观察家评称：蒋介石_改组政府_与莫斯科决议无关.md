　　Red Star Newspaper Observer Comments:
    Chiang Kai-shek's "Government Reorganization" is Unrelated to the Moscow Resolution
    【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th】 TASS, 27th: Red Star newspaper observer Ivogeniev recently commented on the Chinese government's "reorganization" stating: The Chinese government's "rejuvenation" has absolutely no connection to the resolution passed by the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference in December 1945. That resolution clearly indicated that domestic democratic elements should be widely absorbed into all departments of the Chinese government. Furthermore, it bears no similarity to the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, because the government resolution requires the organization of a coalition government on the basis of broad participation of all parties and non-party personages. This "reorganization," falsely claiming to be a "multi-party government," is essentially just a new trick by the Kuomintang to maintain its ruling position, and it does not change its policies in the slightest.

　　红星报观察家评称：
    蒋介石“改组政府”与莫斯科决议无关
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】塔斯社二十七日讯：红星报观察家伊佛根也夫顷评中国政府的“改组”称：中国政府的“返老还童”与一九四五年十二月莫斯科三外长会议通过的决议是毫无关系的。该决议明示，应广泛的吸收国内民主分子到中国政府的各部门。而且也与政治协商会议的决议毫无相同之处，因为政府决议是要求在各党派及无党无派人士广泛参加的基础上组织联合政府。这种冒称“多党政府”的“改组”，本质上只是国民党保持其统治地位的新花样，丝毫未改变其政策。
