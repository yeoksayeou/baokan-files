　　Military Supply Factory Increases Production and Makes Meritorious Contributions
  　Summer Clothing Completed on Schedule, Bomb Production More Than Doubles
    [This Newspaper] News: The military supply No. 2 clothing factory's production increase and meritorious service campaign, thanks to the efforts of all employees, not only smoothly completed the summer clothing task, but also improved the workers' awareness and produced many heroic models. For the entire factory, production achieved on-time completion of tasks, ensuring timely supply to the front lines. From the second half of March to May 4th, the average output increased by one-fifth compared to before the meritorious service campaign. There was also great progress in quality compared to the past, generally achieving accurate sizes and consistent colors. Individual workers or groups still occasionally made mistakes, but they were quickly corrected once pointed out. The leadership often said to everyone, "Although we make a lot of clothes, each comrade can only wear one or two sets. As for us, who would want to wear damaged ones?" Generally, each group can complete the weekly production plan. And many groups exceeded the plan by one-third or even one-half. The entire factory has now entered a period of rest and adjustment, in addition to maintaining a full production spirit and continuing production for a certain period, it is also carrying out study and hygiene campaigns to further improve political awareness, enhance physical health, and prepare for the more arduous winter clothing task.

　　军供工厂增产立功
  　夏衣按期完成炸弹多出一倍
    【本报讯】军供第二被服厂的增产立功运动，由于全体职工的努力，不仅顺利地完成了夏衣任务，并且提高了工人的觉悟程度，出现了许多英雄模范。在全厂来说，产量上做到了按期完成任务，保证前方的及时供给。从三月下半月起到五月四日止，平均产量比立功运动前提高五分之一。在质量上也比已往大有进步，一般的做到了尺码准确，颜色一致。个别工人或个别组虽还不断出些毛病，但一经指出，也能迅速纠正。领导上常对大家说：“衣服做的虽多，而每个同志只能穿一两套，拿咱们来说谁愿意穿坏的呢？”以各组来说，基本上都能完成每周的生产计划。而有很多组超过了计划的三分之一甚至二分之一。现在全厂已进入了休整阶段，除保持饱满的生产情绪，在一定的时间内继续进行生产外，并开展了学习与卫生运动，再度提高政治觉悟，增强身体健康，准备力量迎接更加繁重的冬衣任务。（焦风）
    【又讯】军供炸弹厂在“迎接全面反攻的早日到来”的口号鼓舞下，全体职工同志均以紧张的姿态赶制军火，生产量空前提高。四月份原定计划为××万颗，仅半月功夫即完成了全月突击任务的百分之六十一点七。随后二十号又提出增加百分之十四的任务。到月终总结工作时，除完成已增加的任务外，又超过了百分之四点八。较之三月份的产量提高到百分之二百廿七。在紧张的增产运动中，涌现出许多人民的功臣，如杨鲁成同志，除了努力工作提前完成任务外，对每个导火都要耐心的检查。有时他班内发生几个病号，他就号召大家加义务工，代替病号同志的工作来完成任务，为争取模范班而努力。张维英同志串绳子，四月份产量较三月份提高百分之三十七。另外如苗振库同志，整天在太阳下拉大锯，毫无怨言。他这种埋头苦干耐心帮助别人的精神，对大家起了推动作用。
