Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 28th: A unit of the Northern Jiangsu People's Liberation Army bravely attacked the Yeting (Yancheng) and Funing sections of the (Nan)tong(gan)yu Highway starting on the 23rd, successively capturing the five strongholds of Tianshe, Gou'andun, Caoyankou, Dongjiaqiao, and Shanggang. They controlled 90 li of the highway, annihilating over 1,400 enemies, creating an unprecedented major victory against Chiang in northern Jiangsu. On the morning of the 23rd, after repelling seven companies of Hao Pengju's remnant Third Division, who were attempting to reinforce Tianshe and Gou'andun from the south of Funing city, the People's Liberation Army launched a general offensive against these two locations. The entire garrison of Tianshe, consisting of two companies (over 120 men) of the Chiang-controlled Funing County Security Brigade under the command of Deputy Zuo Fengchen, surrendered completely. The entire garrison of Gou'andun, consisting of the Second Battalion of Hao's remnant Third Division Seventh Regiment (over 500 men including the battalion commander and deputy battalion commander) was annihilated. The Liberation Army took advantage of the victory and divided its forces to advance south. The enemies in Dongjiaqiao, Caoyankou, and Shanggang fled towards Yeting city upon hearing the news, and the three places were thus liberated. By this point, Funing was isolated, and the victories are still expanding. According to preliminary statistics, over 100 enemies were killed or wounded, over 500 enemies (including battalion commanders and deputy commanders of the security brigade) and over 800 local Chiang's puppets were captured. The captured equipment included 20 light and heavy machine guns, 6 grenade launchers, over 500 rifles, over 40,000 rounds of ammunition, 40 bayonets, 5 telephones, 10 war horses, 2 boats of military uniforms, and countless other military supplies.
