　　Opinions on Organizing Border Area Production
　　Yang Kehong Wu Dekai
　　Based on our understanding of the situation in Taigu, we offer the following opinions on organizing the masses in border areas to carry out production for your reference:

　　Based on the struggle situation and our work foundation, we can roughly divide the areas into three types. The common demand of the masses in these three types of areas is to organize and carry out production, but it is necessary to overcome the difficulties of labor, livestock, and food. In the guerrilla areas where the enemy has an advantage, such as the three villages of Xilu and Xiazhuang, the statistics show that there are currently 1,231 people and 9,500 mu of land, with 295 able-bodied laborers. Each able-bodied laborer cultivates an average of 31.2 mu of land. In addition, they have to build fortifications for the enemy, and each laborer has to bear 10 workdays per month. Although the burden on the people is very heavy, if we can organize male laborers for mutual aid, and women (semi-laborers) and auxiliary laborers to participate in production, the labor problem can still be solved. The three villages have a total of 65 livestock, with each animal cultivating an average of 146 mu of land. Except for half of the wheat land, if properly organized, the livestock problem can also be solved. The main difficulty for the masses is insufficient food. The formal burden imposed by the enemy is an average of more than two shi of wheat per person, not including payments and extra extortion. For this type of area, we should lead the masses to use various forms to oppose the enemy's plunder (including civilian food), and combine this with the implementation of land reform to reduce our burden. On this basis, mobilizing and organizing all male and female, able-bodied and semi-laborers to participate in production will not be a problem. Appropriate food relief is a concrete work to solve the current production difficulties and promote production. The most basic method is to implement land reform. The experience of Taigu: detain the landlords, and at the same time train the peasants (activists), and then mobilize the masses to fight the landlords in the rear villages. The peasants obtained land, livestock, and food, which solved the production difficulties; combined with legal struggles, they gained time for production and achieved great results.

　　The second type is the guerrilla area where enemy planes frequently enter and exit, and the enemy and our forces are basically equal. The peasants have partially been mobilized, although the mobilization is very poor, but the landlords are wary of the peasants and dare not do whatever they want. According to the statistics of eight villages including Donglu and Nantai, there are currently 491 able-bodied laborers and 25,216 mu of land, with each laborer cultivating an average of 51 mu of land. In addition, the burden on the people in these areas is not light, so the main difficulty in production is the lack of labor. Livestock is generally not a problem. The eight villages have a total of 171 livestock, and it takes 37 days to complete sowing. In this type of area, we should combine armed struggle and legal struggle, and on the basis of the emancipation movement, organize women, semi-laborers, and auxiliary laborers to participate in agricultural production. Necessary labor support is indispensable.

　　The third type of area is where the armed struggle between the enemy and ourselves is very sharp, the enemy is constantly raiding, and the masses are constantly fleeing, but basically we have the advantage, but the lives of the masses are not stable enough, and both labor and livestock are difficult, especially livestock. According to the statistics of six villages including Fancun and Huima, there are a total of 865 households and 3,940 people. Most village cadres and activists can exist in the village. The loss of livestock and farm tools in this type of area is very serious. The six villages have a total of 26,388 mu of land, 797 laborers, and 127 livestock, with each laborer cultivating an average of 45.6 mu of land, and each livestock cultivating an average of 287 mu of land. Therefore, labor and livestock are the specific difficulties in current production. In this type of area, we should carry out guerrilla warfare combined with production movement. The experience of the labor-military combination in Fancun and Yancun is: the militia and the masses each form mutual aid teams. The mutual aid teams of the masses are voluntarily combined and organized according to the area where they live, and the militia is formed separately, which is convenient for combat. The militia does the work in the front, and protects the masses doing the work in the back, and they exchange work with each other. If the militia delays work due to combat, the masses will return the work. Sometimes the militia goes to other villages to help block and strike the enemy, and takes time to work for the local masses and sell labor. The militia has achieved the combination of armed struggle and production. In terms of equivalent exchange, due to the lack of labor and the short production time, the value of labor is higher. The method of contracting work by work, piecework, and absorbing women, semi-laborers, and auxiliary laborers to participate is adopted. In addition, joint defense is organized to support each other and protect each other. The masses who have withdrawn should find a more stable rear area so that they can enter and exit at any time to organize production and strive to be unaffected or less affected.

　　组织边地生产意见
    杨克虹　吴德凯
    我们根据太谷情况的了解，对边地组织群众开展生产问题，提出如下意见，以供参考：
    根据斗争形势与我们的工作基础，大体可分为三种地区；这三种地区，群众的共同要求是组织起来开展生产，但必须克服劳畜力及粮食等困难。在敌占优势的游击区，如西炉下庄等三个村的统计，现有人一二三一个，土地九五○○亩，全劳力二九五个，每个全劳力平均耕三一、二亩地，再加以给敌人修筑工事，每个劳力每月需负担十个工，虽然民力负担支付很大，但如果很好组织男劳力变工，妇女半劳力辅助劳力参加生产，劳力问题还可以解决。三个村共有牲口六五头，每头平均耕地一四六亩，除二分之一麦地外，组织好的话，畜力问题也可以解决。群众主要困难是粮食不足用，对敌人的正式负担每人平均麦子二石以上，付款与额外敲榨尚不在内。对这种地区，应当是领群众运用各种形式，反对敌人掠夺，（包括民用粮食），结合实行土地改革，减轻对我负担。在这个基础上，动员组织一切男女全半劳力参加生产是不成问题。适当的粮食救济是解决目前生产困难、推动生产的具体工作。最基本办法，还是实行土地改革。太谷经验：把地主扣起来，同时对农民进行训练（积极分子），然后发动群众在靠后的村里对地主进行斗争。农民得到土地牲口粮食，解决了生产困难；结合合法斗争，争取时间进行生产，取得了很大成绩。
    第二种是敌机经常进出的游击区，敌我力量基本相等，农民部分的有了发动，虽然发动的很差，但地主对农民存有戒心，不敢为所欲为。根据东炉南台等八个村的统计，现共有全劳力四九一个，土地二五二一六亩，每个劳力平均耕地五一亩，加上这些地区民力负担也不轻，因之生产中的主要困难，即是劳动力缺乏，畜力一般不甚困难，八个村共有牲口一七一头，下种需三七天即可完成。在这类地区，应当是把武装斗争和合法斗争相结合，在翻身运动基础上，组织妇女半劳力辅助劳力参加农业生产，必要的劳力支援是不可少的。
    第三种地区，敌我武装斗争很尖锐，敌人不断突袭，群众经常逃难，但基本上我占优势，但群众生活不够安定，劳畜力均感困难，特别是畜力更困难。据范村、回马等六个村统计，共八六五户，三九四○口人，大部分村干部积极分子可以在村内存在，这类地区牲口农具损失很厉害，六个村共有地二六三八八亩，劳力七九七个，牲口一二七头，每个劳力平均耕地四五·六亩，牲口每头耕地平均二八七亩。因此劳畜力即是目前生产上的具体困难，这类地区，应是开展游击战争结合生产运动。范村、阎村劳武结合的经验是：由民兵与群众各组互助组，群众互助组按所住地区自愿结合组织，民兵单独组成，便于战斗，民兵在前面做活，一面掩护群众在后面做活，相互变工。民兵战斗误工，由群众还工，有时民兵到其他村帮助封锁打击敌人，抽工夫给当地群众做活卖工，民兵做到了武装斗争结合生产。在等价交换上，因劳力缺乏，生产时间短促，劳动力价值较高，均采取按活计工、按片做活的包工办法，并吸收妇女半劳力辅助劳力参加。此外还组织联防相互支援，相互保卫，退出的群众适当的找一个较安定的后方，以便随时进出组织生产，争取不受或少受损失。
