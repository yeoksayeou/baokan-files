[This dispatch from our Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Office, dated 11th] Turned-over farmers in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region are enthusiastically joining the army. By April 25th, over 7,700 people had signed up. In Shou Zhang's third district, 400 people signed up at the district farmers' meeting, and another 700 signed up upon returning to their villages. Twenty-nine militiamen from He Hui Village, led by militia captain Zhang Huai'en, collectively signed up for the army. Young women in the village prepared to send off their husbands while also taking their husbands' guns and carrying them themselves, forming two women's militia platoons. They said, "The men go to the front lines to fight Chiang Kai-shek, and the women stay in the rear to fight the local despots." Currently, more than 3,500 people have signed up in the four districts. In Qingfeng County, 2,563 young men have already signed up. In Guancheng, 600 people from the fourth district alone have enlisted. The masses in Zhangqiu County proposed, "Guard your own doors, manage your own teams." In addition to young men joining the army, the elderly want to be cooks, the young want to be medics, and the women want to be nurses. Despite repeated explanations, they still refuse to go home. The district government printed "Glorious Certificates for Reserve Anti-Chiang Soldiers" and distributed them to everyone, instructing them to return home and await orders. Only then did they agree to go back. In Fan County's first, fourth, and fifth districts, 1,100 young people joined the army in three days. In Wang Jian Village in the first district, 44 young men collectively enlisted.

[This dispatch from our Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Office, dated 11th] The turned-over farmers in Guan County have launched an enthusiastic movement to support the army. Wherever the Eighth Route Army passes or is stationed, the masses actively raise funds to comfort the troops. When soldiers are stationed in any village, they feel like they are at home. Wherever the wounded and sick go, children feed them, and women sew and wash for them, treating them even better than their own relatives. When a certain artillery unit was stationed in Donglin Village, every family busied themselves cleaning their houses, the women busied themselves boiling water, and the young men busied themselves cutting grass to feed the horses. The next day, the women busied themselves washing clothes for the soldiers. The comrades in the unit were very excited and said, "Lin Village is like our own home, and the elders in the village are like our own parents." The women's association in Gu × heard that wounded soldiers had arrived and immediately sent representatives to find the person in charge to ask for clothes to wash and automatically collected 30,000 yuan to buy meat, noodles, and other items to offer comfort. Wang Ying's family said to the wounded soldiers, "The poor have been liberated, don't be sad, take good care of yourselves, and if you have any difficulties, our women will help you." The women of Qiandiwan voluntarily made five sets of military uniforms without charging labor costs and also donated 900 jin of grain.

　　冀鲁豫七千农民参军
    观县群众热烈集款招待伤员
    【本报冀鲁豫十一日电】冀鲁豫翻身农民纷纷参军，截止四月二十五日，已有七千七百余人报名。寿张三区在区农民大会上报名者四百名，回村又增至七百名。何回村二十九名民兵，在民兵队长张怀恩带领下，集体报名参军。该村青年妇女们一面准备欢送丈夫，一面接过丈夫的枪自己背上，成立了两个妇女民兵班，她们说：“男的上前线打大老蒋，女的在后方打小老蒋”。现四个区已有三千五百余人报名。清丰县现已有二千五百六十三名青壮年报名。观城仅四区即有六百人入伍。张秋县群众提出：“自己的大门自己看，自己的队伍自己干”。除青壮年参军外，老的要当伙夫，小的要当卫生员，妇女要当看护，再三解释，仍不回家。区政府印了“反蒋后备军光荣证”，发给每个人，回去听候调动，这样大家才肯回去。范县一、四、五区在三天中，有一千一百青年参军，一区王坚村有四十四名青壮年集体参军。
    【本报冀鲁豫十一日电】观县的翻身农民展开热烈的拥军运动。八路军经过和驻军的地方，群众纷纷集款劳军，战士们驻到任何一个村里，觉得像到家一样，伤病员走到那里，儿童给喂饭，妇女给缝洗。送鸡蛋、挂面……真比待亲人还好。某部炮兵驻东林庄时，家家忙着打扫房子，妇女忙着烧水，青年忙着切草喂马。第二天，妇女又忙着给战士去洗衣服，部队同志很兴奋，都说：“林庄像自己的家，村中父老像自己的爸娘”。谷×的妇女会听说伤员来了，即派代表找负责人要衣服洗，并自动集合了三万元买成肉、挂面等前去慰问。王英全家向伤员说：“穷人翻身了，别难过，好好养着，有困难我们妇女来帮助”。前堤湾的妇女自动作军衣五件，不要工价，并且还募捐了九百斤粮食。
