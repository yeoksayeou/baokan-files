　　Taihang Industries' Workers
    Achieve Average Production Increase of Fifty Percent
    [This newspaper, Taihang, 30th dispatch] Workers in various industries in Taihang are launching a fervent production increase and merit-making campaign to welcome the "May 1st" Labor Day. Since the Taihang Federation of Trade Unions issued the call on "February 7th" to "Increase output, expand production, and launch a merit-making movement for the people," more than 200 light and heavy industries in over twenty counties and cities including Xingshi, Shahe, Neiqiu, Zanhuang, Changshi, Lucheng, Xiangyuan, Zuoquan, Heshun, Yushe, Wuxiang, Xiyang, Pind Ding, and Anyang, encompassing military supplies, machinery, coal mines, textiles, printing, tobacco, paper, postal services, and transportation, have launched merit-making campaigns, achieving remarkable results. In the past two months, output has generally increased by 50% compared to before the campaign. The movement began with promoting democracy, examining leadership, and carrying out ideological education on current events and land reform. The "Think about the past, compare it to the present, and look to the future" ideological consciousness movement launched by the Qingbeishan Coal Mine in Wuxiang enabled everyone to realize that the factory belongs to the workers themselves, and increasing production means winning battles. It also proposed: "Those without merit should make merit, and those with merit should add merit upon merit." As workers' awareness increased and production enthusiasm soared, competitions were widely launched. The Changshi Trade Union and the Xing City Second and Third District Trade Unions, as well as the Hua Feng Iron Factory and the Changshi Bomb Factory, exchanged competition letters and established competition judging committees. All factories, from managers to cooks, have formulated production and saving plans. The Hua Feng Iron Factory, with hundreds of workers, under the slogan "Striving for Taihang's machinery self-sufficiency," completed and exceeded its eighty-five-day production plan by one time from the beginning of March to April 13th, with the entire factory contributing an extra 6,579 hours of voluntary labor. The Xiahebao Coal Mine in Lucheng broke the highest record by digging coal seams from one foot three inches to six feet, exceeding the total task of January and February combined by two times in March. Workers at the Zanhuang Yu Ji Silk and Cotton Weaving Factory are working hard for 1,000 catties of silk fabrics and 11,000 catties of cotton fabrics. Zhao Xiushu wove nine zhang and six chi of cloth in one day, setting the highest weaving record in Taihang. Postal workers added night shifts to ensure that the front lines could see newspapers early, with each postal worker traveling more than eighty li per day. Workers also automatically launched salary reduction, labor donation, and frugality movements. In the past two months, according to incomplete statistics from thirty units including the Taihang Paper Mill, the Daxing Tobacco Company Fourth Factory, the Changshi Bomb Factory, the Hua Feng Iron Factory, and the Duli Coal Mine in Anyang, more than 2,000 workers saved 42,400 catties of millet, donated over 2.6 million yuan, and contributed 4,751 units of labor. At the Changshi Bomb Factory, workers Gao Xiulong and Zhang Wanchang painstakingly researched and transformed the groove pressing machine, increasing production by twenty times compared to last year. The bombs produced, after testing, 95% can explode, each bursting into more than thirty-seven pieces, eliminating duds and slow explosions. The Changshi Jiazhang Coal Mine invented using iron wire rope instead of steel wire rope, saving 480,000 yuan in cost per rope. The merit-making movement in factories everywhere is still going on enthusiastically.
