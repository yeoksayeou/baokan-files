　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: TASS, London: The vast majority of the two hundred representatives at the National Cooperative Congress meeting in Weston-super-Mare condemned the British government's foreign policy. When representative Banks proposed a suggestion, he said: If the recent foreign policy continues, it will endanger the future development of Britain. Referring to Legier's policies towards Greece and elsewhere, Banks said: "Our hopeful Labour government should abandon all these absurd and meaningless measures. Britain should not be indifferent to the new democracies; but we see that we are bound by American capitalism, which has declared its intention to dominate the world." Another representative, McHale, strongly advocated cooperation with the Soviet Union.

　　英合作者年会多数代表
    反对贝文外交政策
    指出英国已受美国束缚
    【新华社陕北十六日电】塔斯社伦敦讯：在维斯吞·苏柏尔开会的全国合作者年会二百代表之中绝大多数都谴责英政府的外交政策。代表之一班斯当提出建议时说：如果最近的外交政策继续下去，将危及英国前途的发展。论及莱吉尔对希腊以及对其他地方的政策时，班斯称：“我们的希望工党政府放弃这一切荒谬无意义的措施。英国对于新的民主国家不应漠然视之；可是我们看到我们已受曾宣称企图统治世界的美国资本主义的束缚。”另外一个代表麦合则极烈地主张和苏联合作。
