Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Shanghai on the 8th, the price of rice in Shanghai has soared to a new high of 360,000 yuan, an increase of 500 percent compared to 60,000 yuan in January. Rice riots have spread throughout Shanghai, with most rice shops refusing to open for fear of being looted. Ordinary citizens are unable to buy rice in many places. In the past few weeks, the prices of other foods have increased by 50 percent, and imported goods have increased by more than 100 percent.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th. Social order and chaos in Shanghai are becoming increasingly serious. According to today's Associated Press dispatch from Shanghai: Along with rising prices, the strike movement is developing rapidly; public bus and tram workers in the former French Concession have gone on strike; 15,000 silk textile workers held their first demonstration march since the implementation of "economic emergency measures" banning demonstrations. In more than ten rice-snatching incidents that occurred in various places, more than a thousand bags of rice were looted. Most rice merchants closed their doors tightly and set up obstacles. Three hundred rice merchants marched in a group to petition Wu Guozhen, demanding that he provide them with "effective protection." On the way back from the petition, the rice merchants smashed the Tiansheng Radio Station and a dye shop. According to the rice merchants, the radio station "slandered" their profession and instigated the people to snatch rice; the dye shop was beaten because it called the rice merchants "rice worms." While searching for the fleeing broadcasters, the rice merchants completely destroyed the equipment of a nearby advertising agency, injuring several people and seriously injuring three. In a panic, Wu Guozhen repeatedly announced: "Those who hoard will be severely punished," and "Troublemakers will be severely punished"; but the turmoil is intensifying.

 　　蒋管区经济危机愈演愈烈
     抢米风潮扩展全沪
     万五千纺织工人示威大游行
    【新华社陕北十日电】据美联社上海八日电称：上海米价已涨至三十六万元新高峰，较之正月的六万元，增涨达百分之五百。米骚动已蔓延全上海，大多数米店唯恐被抢而拒绝开门，一般市民们在许多地方已买不到米吃，过去数周中，其他食品价格增涨百分之五十，入口货则增涨百分之百以上。
    【新华社陕北十日电】上海社会秩序的不安与混乱，日益严重。据今日美联社上海电讯：与物价上涨同时，罢工运动迅速发展；前法租界之共公汽车与电车工人，已举行罢工；一万五千名丝织业工人，举行了实行“经济紧急措施”禁止示威以来的首次示威游行。在各地发生的十余处抢米事件中，已有千余包米被抢，多数米商紧关大门，并布置障碍物。三百米商结队向吴国桢请愿，要求予他们“有效保护”，请愿返回时，米商们捣毁天声广播电台及一个染料店，据米商说：该广播台“诽谤”他们的职业，并挑唆人民抢米；染料店则因叫米商们“米虫”而遭打，米商们搜索逃跑的广播员时，将附近一广告院设备完全捣毁，殴打中数人受伤，三人重伤。吴国桢于慌忙中，一再宣布：“囤积者将受严惩”，“骚动者受严格处分”；但骚动不安却愈演愈烈。
