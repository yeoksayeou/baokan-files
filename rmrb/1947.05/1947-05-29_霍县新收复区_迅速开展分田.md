　　Huo County Newly Recovered Areas
    Rapid Land Redistribution
    [This dispatch from Taiyue, 27th] The land reform movement in the newly recovered areas of Huo County is developing rapidly. From April 28th to the 13th of this month, 13 villages out of the 37 newly recovered villages in the county have been broken through. In seven villages, including Xizhang, Dazhang, and Jiameng, 18 mass grievance meetings have been held, with 2,259 people participating, resulting in 84 liberated model citizens, and the reckoning of 27 landlords and local bullies. In the struggle, each village also created many new methods based on the characteristics of the new areas. For example, Xizhang Village proposed the slogan "Struggle thoroughly in one go, overthrow feudalism," and for several consecutive days, they reckoned with 11 households of bullying landlords. Dazhang Village created a "blooming everywhere" method of struggle. With more than 500 households in the village, feudal forces were relatively strong. The masses divided into three groups to struggle simultaneously, blooming everywhere, with a great momentum, suppressing the reactionary forces and promoting the entire movement in the newly liberated area. The reasons for the rapid and vigorous development of the movement: First, the masses suffered long-term oppression by the Chiang-Yan troops, the influence of the mass movement in the old liberated areas, and the encouragement of victories at the front. Second, in terms of leadership, in addition to vigorously publicizing the land reform policy, more than 100 cadres were concentrated for a blitz, and the masses returning from the old liberated areas introduced their experiences of liberation. Third, the movement was controlled everywhere based on the opinions of the masses, and the class consciousness of the masses was raised. At the beginning of the movement, the masses only demanded a little bit at a time to eliminate feudal forces. After the movement developed, they demanded a thorough struggle. We also advanced and improved the movement step by step according to the demands of the masses.

　　霍县新收复区
    迅速开展分田
    【本报太岳二十七日电】霍县新收复区土地改革运动正迅速发展中。自四月二十八日至本月十三日，全县新收复区之三十七个村已突破十三村。西张、大张、贾孟等七村先后进行了十八次群众诉苦大会，参加人数达二千二百五十九名，涌现出八十四位翻身模范，清算了二十七个地主恶霸。斗争中各村并根据新区的特点，创造了不少的新方式。如西张村提出“一口气斗争彻底，打垮封建”的口号，连续几天，清算了十一户恶霸地主。大张村创造了“遍地开花”的斗争方式，该村五百余户，封建势力较强固。群众分三个集团同时斗争，到处开花，声势浩大，压服了反动势力，推动了整个新解放区运动。运动发展迅速猛烈之原因：第一是群众遭蒋阎军长期压榨，老解放区群众运动的影响，前方胜利的鼓舞。第二、领导上除大力宣传土地改革政策外，又集中百余干部进行突击，由老区回来的群众介绍其翻身经过。第三、处处根据群众意见掌握运动，提高群众阶级觉悟。运动的开始，群众对消灭封建势力只要求一点一点来。运动发展后，即要求彻底斗争。我们亦随着群众的要求步步推进与提高运动。
