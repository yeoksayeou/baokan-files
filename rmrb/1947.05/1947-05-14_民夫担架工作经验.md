Experiences in People's Militia Stretcher Work
    Li Zhendong
    During the recent Jinan campaign, the people's militia stretcher work had strict organization and division of leadership, so no militiaman deserted. The organization and leadership of the Yangcheng Sixth District stretcher team is introduced below:
    The Yangcheng Sixth District participated in a certain unit's people's militia with a total of forty stretchers, four people per stretcher, a total of one hundred and sixty people, plus miscellaneous personnel a total of one hundred and ninety-nine people. There was a captain and a deputy captain, the headquarters had one executive officer, two communications personnel, a doctor, a carpenter, and a shoemaker, for a total of eight people in the headquarters. There were four squads, each squad had a squad leader, every ten stretchers were divided into three groups, plus one clerk, three cooks, and two communications personnel. In the above organization, everyone had a specific task and job. The entire company had twenty-four party members, organized a branch, and the branch committee divided the leadership of the party work of the entire company, becoming the leading core of the team and the promoter of all work. Under the organization of the branch, it was divided into four groups, and each squad had a group, and branch members participated in the life of each group. Due to the strict organization and division of labor inside and outside the party and the exemplary and promoting role of party members, the completion of various work tasks of the entire company was guaranteed, and the morale of the militiamen was consolidated and improved. After each march and arrival at the camp, they reviewed the advantages and disadvantages of the march, and praised the good marches and good mutual assistance, so that no one fell behind during the march, and their morale remained high. In addition, the troops' care for the participants was more considerate than before. First of all, regarding the issue of livelihood, the militiamen had a good life at home, but during the war, they only had two meals of millet a day, which was hard. Therefore, the comrades leading the militiamen in the troops ground the millet into flour during the intervals of the battle, and at the same time, the supply department of the troops also provided a meal of white flour every two or three days, giving them great encouragement. Secondly, the issue of safety: in addition to constantly carrying out simple military common sense education, such as air defense using terrain, etc., specific care must also be taken. For example, a certain unit tried its best to use the troops' medical team to carry the wounded to the front line and transport them to the regimental bandage station, and then asked the militiamen to transfer them to the rear. In addition, digging trenches, the troops' soldiers pioneered in the front, and asked the militiamen to dig and repair fortifications in the rear. In addition to this, attention must be paid to command at all times to prevent enemy shells and rifle grenades. In this operation, only one militiaman of a certain unit was injured, mainly because he was digging fortifications at night, and the militiaman Lu Quanke was very active. When the enemy shells came, he didn't know, and others called him to hide, but he didn't hear, so he was injured. Finally, it is also worth noting that the comrades in the army who lead the militiamen should integrate with the militiamen and live together. At the beginning, the comrades who led the militiamen ate in the army, and the militiamen said, "You have a good life, which affects morale." Please ask our comrades to eat with the militiamen, and the militiamen reflected, "This is really a military-civilian family."

　　民夫担架工作经验
    李振东
    这次晋南作战中，民夫担架工作有了严密的组织和分工领导，因而没有发生一个民夫逃亡的。兹将阳城六区担架队组织与领导情形介绍如下：
    阳城六区参加某部的民夫共四十付担架，四个人一付，共一百六十人，连杂务人员共一百九十九人，设有中队长中队副各一人，中队部有事务长一人、通讯员二人、医生、木匠、掌鞋匠各一人，中队部共八人组成。下分四个分队，每分队有分队长一人，每十付担架分三个班，还有事务员一人，炊事员三人、通讯员二人。以上的组织，每人都有个人的具体任务及工作。全中队共有党员二十四人，组织了支部，支委分工领导全中队党的工作，成为该队领导核心和一切工作的推动者。在支部的组织下，分四个小组，每个分队设小组，支部委员分别参加各小组过生活。由于有党内外的严密组织和分工及党员的模范与推动作用，保证了全中队各种工作任务的完成，巩固提高了民夫情绪。他们每次行军到达了宿营地后，就检讨行军中的优缺点，将行军好互助好的进行表扬，因之在行军中没有掉队的，情绪始终高涨。此外，部队对参战人员的照顾上，也较前更为周到，首先对生活问题，民夫在家生活好，参战时一天两顿小米，生活苦。因之部队带民夫的同志，在战隙中把米磨成面，同时部队供给部门也两三天给搞一顿白面吃，给他们很大鼓励。其次安全问题：除不断进行简单军事常识教育，如防空利用地形等外，还要具体照顾。如某部尽可能用部队卫生队架担到火线把伤员运到团绷带所，再叫民夫往后转送。另外挖战壕，部队战士在前边开辟，叫民夫在后边挖修工事。除此以外，还要随时注意指挥，以防敌人炮弹、枪榴弹。在这次作战，某部只有一个民夫受伤，主要是在夜间挖工事时，民夫芦全科很积极，敌人炮弹打来他不知道，别人叫隐蔽，他没听见，因而打伤了。最后，军队带民夫的同志参和民夫打成一片，生活在一起，也是值得注意的。开始带民夫的同志在部队吃饭，民夫说，你们生活好，对情绪有影响。请来我们的同志和民夫一块吃饭，民夫反映说：“这真是军民一家。”
