Xinhua News Agency, Hua Dong Front, May 23rd: Frontline reporters reported the annihilation of the 74th Division: Chiang Kai-shek gathered 300,000 troops to attack the Yimeng Mountains, attempting to salvage his already doomed defeat. On May 11th, Chiang's 74th Division, in coordination with the 25th and 83rd Divisions, advanced from the Lin (Yi) Meng (Yin) Road, attempting to attack Yishui via Tanbu (12 li northeast of Mengyin). On that day, the 74th Division advanced north from the Duozhuang and Jiepai line (both on the Linmeng Road), encountering resistance from a unit of the East China People's Liberation Army in areas such as Sanjiaoshan, Shuitanggou, and Yangjiazhai (all in the mountainous area south of Tanbu). The enemy repeatedly launched fierce attacks but were repelled, leaving behind numerous corpses. By the evening of the 13th, the People's Liberation Army's various armies had rushed to the Tanbu area and immediately launched a counter-offensive. Seeing the situation was not good, the enemy retreated. The People's Liberation Army quickly followed and pursued, eliminating enemy resistance along the way and cutting off their retreat. On the night of the 14th, the encirclement of the enemy was completed, and on the 15th, the fleeing 74th Division was completely compressed into the Menglianggu Mountains. The People's Liberation Army concentrated powerful artillery fire, illuminating the night sky with flashes of light, as bright as day. For several days, the Chiang troops encountered thorough scorched-earth policies everywhere, making it difficult to obtain food and drink. Moreover, after continuous fighting and casualties, ammunition, supplies, and baggage were mostly abandoned during the retreat. The Menglianggu mountains were rugged and sparsely populated, lacking both food and water. Although Chiang's aircraft dropped food and soda during the day, most of it was seized by the People's Liberation Army. From the 15th onwards, Chiang's 83rd Division advanced north from Qingtuosi (75 li north of Linyi on the Linmeng Road), the 7th and 48th Divisions advanced west from Jiehu (60 li southwest of Yishui) and Heyang (80 li southwest of Yishui), the 25th and 65th Divisions advanced east from Taoxu, Mengyin (24 li southeast of Mengyin on the Linmeng Road), and the 11th Division advanced south from Xintai, all of which were strongly resisted and repelled by the People's Liberation Army, and parts of each were annihilated and captured. On the evening of the 15th, the People's Liberation Army launched a general attack on Chiang's 74th Division, which was surrounded in the Menglianggu Mountains. The enemy division commander, Zhang Lingfu, personally commanded his three brigades to defend several bare mountaintops, stubbornly resisting. The People's Liberation Army heroically charged and fought the enemy repeatedly in hand-to-hand combat, and bombarded the enemy's positions with intensive artillery fire. The mountaintops were filled with thick smoke and flames, shrapnel and rubble, like thunder. The People's Liberation Army broke through the enemy's positions one after another, annihilating a large number of enemies. That night, the People's Liberation Army captured Height 520, and after midnight, defeated the enemy's five or six counterattacks and captured Height 540. At dawn on the 16th, Height 600 was captured. At noon, the People's Liberation Army assault troops had climbed steep cliffs and controlled all the commanding heights of Menglianggu. The 74th Division had suffered heavy casualties, was disintegrating, and batches of soldiers laid down their weapons. The enemy division commander, Zhang Lingfu, was killed while attempting to break through, and was buried in Menglianggu along with nearly ten thousand of his officers and soldiers. The 74th Division was completely annihilated.

　　七十四师覆灭经过
    【新华社华东前线二十三日电】前线记者报导：蒋军七十四师覆灭经过称：蒋介石集结三十万兵力进攻沂蒙山区，妄图挽救其已定之败局。五月十一日，蒋军七十四师配合二十五师、八十三师自临（沂）蒙（阴）路出犯，企图经坦埠（蒙阴东北十二里）转犯沂水。当日，七十四师由垛庄、界牌（均在临蒙路上）一线北犯，遭华东人民解放军某部阻击于三角山、水塘崮、杨家寨等地（均在坦埠以南山地），敌屡次猛攻均被击退，遗尸累累。至十三日晚，解放军各路大军驰至坦埠地区，立即举行反攻。敌见势不妙，即行后撤。解放军迅速跟踪追击，一路排除敌人顽抗，并截断其退路。十四日夜完成对敌包围，十五日即将狼奔豕突的七十四师完全压缩在孟良崮大山中。解放军集中强大炮火猛轰，弹光照明夜空，如同白昼。蒋军则数日来到处遭遇彻底空舍清野，饮食困难；又经连日战斗伤亡，弹药、给养、辎重亦甚多遗弃在溃退途中。而孟良崮高山野岭，人烟稀少，粮水俱无，白天虽有蒋机投掷食品、汽水，但多数为解放军所获。十五日起，蒋军八十三师自青驼寺（临沂北七十五里临蒙路上）北援，第七师、四十八师自界湖（沂水西南六十里）、河阳（沂水西南八十里）西援，二十五师、六十五师自蒙阴桃墟（蒙阴东南二十四里临蒙路上）东援，十一师自新泰南援，均遭解放军强力阻击，一一击退；并歼俘其各一部。十五日晚，解放军向被围于孟良崮群山之蒋军七十四师发动总攻，敌师长张灵甫亲自指挥所部三个旅据守几座光秃秃的山顶，顽强抵抗；解放军英勇冲杀，与敌反复肉搏，更以密集炮火轰击敌阵，山头上俱是浓烟烈火，弹片碎石，如巨雷轰鸣，解放军逐次突破敌阵地，大量歼灭了敌人。当晚，解放军攻克五二○高地，午夜后打垮敌五、六次反冲锋，攻入五四○高地。十六日拂晓，又攻克六○○高地。中午解放军攻山部队已攀登峭壁悬崖，控制孟良崮所有制高点；七十四师已伤亡惨重，溃不成军，一批批放下了武器。敌师长张灵甫于突围时被击毙，与其近万官兵一起葬身孟良崮，七十四师乃告全部覆灭。
