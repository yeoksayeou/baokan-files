　　County Magistrate Leads Planting
    Feixiang Villages Complain of Too Few Buckets
    [Report from this newspaper in Feixiang] Seeing that the long drought would cause delays in the farming season, the masses of this county carried water to plant cotton. The government also mobilized Party, government, civilian, and military personnel to go to the countryside to lead and help. County Magistrate Zhang and others went to villages such as Guojiabao to water and carry water for the masses. Seeing that the county magistrate and cadres were working for them, the masses' enthusiasm was further enhanced. There were no idlers in the streets of various villages, and people were busy everywhere, either with carts making noise irrigating the land, or farmers carrying water to fill the pits, sweating profusely. Some dug pits, some filled pits. Some boys, naked, used ladles to scoop water into the pits, girls carried baskets to plant cotton seeds, and primary school students planted their school fields in groups and collectively helped military families with planting. Everywhere one hears about a lack of water buckets, everywhere one hears about the wells running dry. The whole county has formed a high tide of planting. (Defu)
    [Report from this newspaper in Lincheng] After hearing the county party committee's call for production, the masses in this village responded to the call with practical actions during the drought, immediately launching a surprise attack to plant cotton, and giving priority to planting for military families. Xue Wenzhi of Xuezhuang Village, Third District (New District), said: "In the past, we relied on the heavens for food and clothing, but now we rely on the power of the masses. As long as we work, we will gain." He and cadre Xue Lihua and others first planted five mu of cotton for military families before planting their own. All the cadres in Chengdongguan went out to plant cotton for military families. Cadres in Heicheng, Second District, took the lead, planting eighty mu of cotton for military families in two and a half days. Teachers and students of Yigao completed their task of planting fifteen mu of cotton for themselves in one day and two mornings, and then helped military families with planting. The county government also carried water to plant cotton. Ninety percent of the people in Gangxi and Beijiahui villages participated in planting cotton. They organized fourteen work-exchange groups, creating a method of using urns to hold water and pulling it to the fields by cart to plant more than 300 mu. Mengjiazhuang, Fifth District (Old District), completed 95 mu in two days. Shi Jialan and Niu Xiaosan said: "The Communist Party calls for great production, and production is still for ourselves." He felt that two buckets of water were not enough each time, so he also carried an extra bucket by hand. Under his influence, Song Laogang, an elderly military family member in his sixties, also participated in planting cotton. Now, the whole county, both new and old districts, has entered a high tide of carrying water to plant cotton. According to incomplete statistics from ten villages including Gangxi, Beijiahui, and Mengjiazhuang, more than 1,500 mu of cotton were planted in three days from the 7th to the 10th. The whole county is now striving to complete the planting of 20,000 mu of cotton. (Chunyi)

　　县长带头点种
    肥乡村村嫌水桶少
    【本报肥乡讯】本县群众见久旱不雨恐失农时，随纷纷担水点种棉花，政府亦发动党政民武分头下乡领导帮助，张县长等到郭家堡等村给群众浇水担水，群众见县长及干部们还给自己做活，情绪更加提高，各村街上没有闲人，遍地人都在忙碌着，不是车响亮着浇地，便是农民们汗流夹背的担水阴坑。挖坑的挖坑，埋坑的埋坑。男孩有的赤着身子用瓢淘水阴坑，女孩提着篮子点花籽，小学生们成群结队点种他们的校田，并集体帮助军属种。到处听说没有水桶使，到处听说井水干了，全县已经形成点种高潮。  （德符）
    【本报临城讯】本村群众听到县委号召生产后，正值天旱不雨，他们都以实际行动响应号召，立即突击点种棉花，并尽先给军属点种。三区薛冢庄（新区）薛文志说：“过去是靠天吃饭穿衣，现在就靠群众力量只要干就沾。”他和干部薛立花等四人先给军属种花五亩后才种自己的。城东关干部全体出动给军属点种。二区黑城干部带头，两天半给军属点花八十多亩，一高师生于一天两早晨完成自己种花十五亩任务后，又帮助军属群众点种。县府亦全体担水植棉。岗西、北驾回二村百分之九十的人参加点种棉花，他们组织起十四个换工组创造以瓮装水、用车往地拉的办法点种三百余亩。五区孟家庄（老区）两天完成九十五亩，石家兰牛小三说：“共产党号召大生产，生产下还不是为自己。”他每次担满两桶水还觉得不沾，又用手多提一桶。在他的影响下，六十多岁的老军属宋老岗也参加点花。现全县不论新老区都进入突击担水点棉的高潮，仅据岗西、北驾回、孟家庄等十个村的不完全统计，从七日至十日三天内点棉一千五百余亩，现全县正在为完成点种两万亩棉花而奋斗。
