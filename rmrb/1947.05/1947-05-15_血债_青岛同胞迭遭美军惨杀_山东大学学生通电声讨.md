Blood Debt
    Qingdao Compatriots Repeatedly Massacred by American Soldiers
    Shandong University Students Issue Telegram Condemning

    [Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 13th] The bloodstains of the rickshaw puller Su Mingcheng, who was killed by American soldiers at the beginning of last month, were not yet dry when Qingdao compatriots were again repeatedly massacred. On the 5th of last month, Mayor Liu Xiuwen was shot and killed by American soldier Wiley with five shots at the American military warehouse in Dagang. On the 20th, an American ten-wheel truck on Jiaozhou Road ran amok and crushed a pregnant woman, Ms. Qi Xu, in her thirties. Her intestines were severed, her abdomen ruptured, and the fetus was crushed into mud, a bloody and tragic sight. Her husband, Qi Mingyi, rushed to the scene upon hearing the news, weeping over the body and demanding revenge for the deceased. On the 21st, an American truck again injured a fifty-year-old man on Yuantai Road, causing extreme outrage throughout the city. That evening, students of Shandong University held an emergency meeting and sent a telegram to the whole country condemning the crimes of the American soldiers. However, this righteous action was brutally suppressed and sabotaged by Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents.

    青岛同胞迭遭美军惨杀
    山东大学学生通电声讨
    【新华社山东十三日电】上月初被美军杀死之车夫苏明城血迹未干，青市同胞又迭遭惨杀。上月五日市长刘修文在大港美军仓库，被美军维利利连射五枪毙命；二十日在胶州路上一美十轮卡车横冲直撞压死一三十余岁孕妇戚徐氏，肠断腹裂，胎儿压成烂泥，血肉模糊，惨不忍睹。其夫戚明义闻讯赶来，抚尸痛哭，要求为死者报仇；二十一日美卡车又在垣台路撞伤一五十岁老人，全市极为激愤。当晚山东大学同学紧急集会，通电全国声讨美军罪行，然这一正义行动反横遭蒋党特务镇压破坏。
