The Battle for Yuncheng Airport
    Feng Mu, Ai Bo

    On the evening of May 6th, a junior officer of Chiang Kai-shek's "Youth Army," in a bunker at Yuncheng Airport, wrote a letter to his friend in Luoyang, saying: "This is truly an ideal barracks, surrounded by overlapping fortifications, numerous bunkers, and several layers of electric fences... It can be called the second Maginot Line, extremely safe, please don't worry." But a few hours later, this officer became a prisoner of the People's Liberation Army. His "bold words" turned into foolishness.

    The defensive works of the airport and Yangtuo Temple, in addition to the several layers of spider web-like electric fences and barbed wire densely distributed around and at the core of the airport, were filled with minefields on all roads and hidden places leading to the outside of the village. The surroundings were two wide and deep trenches of three zhang each, and the edge of the trench was a circle of chain-like hidden bunkers and blockhouses, blocking all roads and open spaces outside the village. Every street, every high building, and every high ground in the village were built with solid bunker groups, forming a tight fire net.

    The American-equipped 106th Division had always been proud of these fortifications, believing that this was an impregnable fortress.

    On the night of May 2nd, completely unexpectedly by the enemy, the people's army suddenly descended on the periphery of the airport. By the time the enemy discovered them, they were already tightly surrounded. The enemy began to fire machine guns wildly in all directions, and the mountain guns kept firing aimlessly. Our troops rested silently in the fortifications outside the village, only the engineering demolition teams were active. At this time, the current in the electric fence was first cut off, and the mines buried on the road were dug out one by one.

    At about four o'clock, a dazzling flare suddenly streaked across the sky, and the first row of shells flew towards the enemy's front line, and dozens of machine guns began to roar. Under the cover of artillery fire, the explosion team of combat hero Li Baochen first ran towards the enemy's outer trench. The first barbed wire fence was blown off, and the bridging team sprinted to the scene. In a few minutes, a bridge was built over the outer trench, one end erected on the outer edge, and the other end on the top of the enemy's first hidden bunker on the front line. The bugle call sounded from all directions, and the assault team, led by the second squad, ran one after another across the outer trench, stepped over the top of the enemy's hidden bunker, and rushed into the enemy's first line of defense. The assault team on the south side also successfully rushed through the enemy's outer fortifications, like many sharp blades stabbing into the enemy's depths.

    The penetrating troops encountered blind and frantic resistance, and several deep firepowers attacked us at the same time. Our heavy machine guns aimed at the enemies guarding the bunkers and the theater stage, blasting the loopholes into large holes, and the explosion team blasted down all the temple walls, annihilating the stubborn enemies. The attacking troops on the right wing were engaged in equally fierce fighting in front of the No. 18 outer bunker, which could block nine roads. At this time, the mountain guns came to help. The first shell hit the top of the bunker, and the second shell pierced the bunker. The enemy began to panic. The soldiers rushed to the bunker together from behind the wall. Following the explosion team, Squad Leader Zhang Yongzhi led the whole squad up to the upper roof of the bunker with door panels and broken ladders, and then rushed into the bunker. A few minutes later, more than twenty prisoners walked out of the bunker.

    At eight o'clock, the Kuomintang sent four bombers to aid the desperate enemy, carrying out frantic strafing and bombing. But our soldiers were very calm in their response. Platoon Leader Nie Chengxin, while attacking a large courtyard, had a large shrapnel penetrate his thigh. He struggled to stand up, gritted his teeth, pulled out the shrapnel with his hand, and rushed forward again. In this way, our troops gradually occupied most of the village. The enemy collapsed, and most of them surrendered their weapons. A small part fled to the airport, and the people's army followed closely. In another large house, an airplane was captured, and soon the large bunker in the northwest corner was also occupied by us.

　　争夺运城机场
    冯牧、艾柏
    五月六日晚，一个蒋家“青年军”的下级军官，在运城飞机场的碉堡里，给他在洛阳的朋友写信说：“这里真是理想的营房，周围工事重叠，碉堡林立，电网数层，………可谓马奇诺防线第二，安全无比，请勿念”。可是几个钟头之后，这个军官就作了解放军的俘虏。“豪语”复成了愚妄。
    飞机场和羊驮寺的防御工事，除了密布在四周和机场核心的数层蛛网似的电网和铁丝网外，凡是能够通到村外的道路和隐蔽地方，都布满了地雷网，四周是两道宽深三丈的外壕、壕边是一圈锁链般的暗碉和碉堡，封锁了村外所有的道路和开阔地。村里的每道街、每座高房、每片高地，都修筑了坚固的碉堡群，组成严密的火网。
    美械装备的一○六师一向凭借着这些工事骄傲，认为这就是一个不可攻克的要塞。
    五月二日夜，完全出乎敌人意料之外，人民军队突然降临到飞机场的外围。等到敌人发现时，他们已经被围得水泄不通了。敌人开始慌乱的用机枪向四围发射，山炮也漫无目标地打个不住。咱们的部队却一声不响地在村外工事里休息着，只有工兵破坏组在活动着，这时电网的电流先被打断了，埋在路上的地雷也一个个被挖了出来。
    四点钟左右，空中突然划过耀目的信号弹，第一排炮弹便向敌人的前沿上飞去，数十挺机枪也开始吼叫起来。在炮火的掩护下，战斗英雄李保臣的爆炸组，首先向敌人外壕跑去。第一道铁丝网被炸断了，搭板组飞奔而至，几分钟间就在外壕上搭起了一道桥梁，一头架在外沿，一头就架在敌人前沿上第一个暗碉顶上。冲锋号从四面八方响起来，以二小队为首的突击队员们，一个跟一个地跑过了外壕，踏过敌人的暗碉顶，冲进了敌人第一道阵地。在南面的突击队，也顺利的冲过敌人的外围工事，像许多把利刃向敌人的纵深刺去。
    深入的部队遇到了盲目的疯狂的抵抗，几道纵深火力又一齐向我进攻。我们的重机枪却对准据守着碉堡和戏台的敌人放射，把枪眼打成了大窟窿，爆炸组又把庙墙全部炸倒了，把顽抗的敌人歼灭了。右翼进攻部队在一个可以封锁九条道路的十八号外碉堡前面，进行同样激烈的战斗。这时山炮赶来助战，第一炮打中了碉顶，第二炮洞穿了碉堡。敌人开始慌乱了。战士们从墙后一齐向碉堡冲去。随着爆炸组，二班长张永志带着全班用门板和坏了的梯子攀上了碉堡的上层房顶，又冲进了碉堡。几分钟之后，有二十多个俘虏从碉堡里走出来。
    八点钟，国民党派来了四架轰炸机援助绝望的敌人，进行疯狂扫射轰炸。但我们的战士们非常沉着应战。一排长聂成心在攻击一所大院时，一块大弹片穿进了他的大腿，他挣扎着立起来，咬着牙，用手将弹片拔出，又向前冲去。就这样，我们的部队逐渐占了多半个村子。敌人崩溃了，大部分就此缴了枪。一小部向飞机场逃去，人民军队紧跟着追过去。又在一座大房子里，缴获了一架飞机，不久西北角上的大碉堡也被我攻占了。
