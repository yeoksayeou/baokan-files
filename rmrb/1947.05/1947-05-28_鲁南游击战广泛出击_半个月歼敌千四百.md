Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 26th—While the main forces are victoriously annihilating the enemy, the guerrilla warfare and explosive movement in the vast area north from Jiaoji Railway, south to Longhai Railway, and west to Jinpu Railway, is spreading like wildfire and is in full swing. According to incomplete statistics, in the first half of this month, there have been over a hundred battles, large and small, in which a thousand Chiang Kai-shek soldiers were killed or wounded, and over four hundred "Homecoming Corps" members were captured. The flying explosive teams and armed work teams active in Linyi, Mengyin, Xintai, Laiwu, Boshan, and the Xintai-Taian lines, widely attacked, perplexed the enemy's actions, blocked the enemy's news, and created good opportunities for the main forces to annihilate the enemy. Yu Guangrong and Zhang Xiangkun's explosive guerrilla teams on the Xintai-Laiwu-Mengyin front killed or wounded 51 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers in two days. On the 8th, when a battalion of Chiang Kai-shek soldiers from Xintai forcibly occupied Woniu Mountain, they were killed or wounded by landmines. On the evening of the 10th, more than 20 landmines exploded continuously on the Xintai-Laiwu highway and in the mountains of Aishanzi, Huangjiashan, and Hujiashan, killing 32 enemies. The Chiang Kai-shek soldiers, forced to be trapped in narrow points and lines, were trembling with fear and hesitant to move forward. The local armed forces persisting on the edge of the Jiaoji Railway, from April 22nd to 24th, won seven battles in the Longgang area between Linqu and Yidu, striking nine times against the Chiang Kai-shek soldiers who went to the countryside to seize grain and conscript soldiers, killing or wounding more than 50 enemies. Now every village is jointly defended, and every mountain is equipped with sentries to monitor the enemy's actions. On the Longhai Railway front, the Binhe local armed forces captured eight important villages and towns, including Huabu, in one week from the 2nd to the 8th, capturing more than 310 "Homecoming Corps" members alive. The offensive is now developing towards the flanks of the Longhai Railway. On the Linyi-Tancheng road, they fought with the enemy six times in three days from the 14th, capturing 18 enemy stretcher bearers, 13 "Homecoming Corps" members, killing 5 enemies, and seizing 8 rifles and 30 stretchers.
