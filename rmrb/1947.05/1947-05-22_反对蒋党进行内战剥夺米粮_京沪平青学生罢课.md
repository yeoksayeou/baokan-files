Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th – Comprehensive reports indicate that the wave of student strikes and teacher boycotts in the KMT-controlled areas is sweeping across the country along with the profound economic crisis. Zhu Jiahua, the KMT Minister of Education, frantically exclaimed that "the situation is deteriorating daily." As of the 18th, the colleges and universities that have initiated strikes and boycotts include: Central University and Jinling University in Nanjing; Jiaotong University, University of Shanghai, Soochow University, Fudan University, Great China University, Jinan University, Shanghai Medical College, and Sino-French Pharmaceutical College in Shanghai; Ying Shi University in Hangzhou; Tsinghua University, Peking University, Yenching University, Railway Management College, Peiyang University, Beijing Normal University, and Beijing Art College in Peiping; Northeastern University in Shenyang; Shandong University in Qingdao; and Henan University in Kaifeng, totaling 21 institutions. Schools in Shanghai and Hangzhou are successively going to Nanjing to petition, disrupting railways such as the Nanjing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines. In Nanjing, the capital of the Chiang dynasty, Central University, Jinling University, and other schools have also staged demonstrations and marches, petitioning the Ministry of Education and the Executive Yuan. They carried banners reading "We want to eat!" and "The civil war has deprived us of our grain!" and wrote slogans against the civil war on the walls of the Ministry of Education. When Zhu Jiahua, the KMT Minister of Education, came out to meet the students, the students shouted, "Stop talking nonsense!" and "Do you know we are starving?" and surrounded him. When the demonstrating students reached Guofu Road, Wang Yunwu, the KMT Deputy Executive Yuan President, wanted to address the students, but the students immediately sang "You bad thing!" (a song extremely popular in the KMT-controlled areas that curses profiteers and corrupt officials) at him. In Peiping, students from Peking University, Tsinghua University, and other schools were giving speeches and putting up posters on Xidan on the 18th when the Peiping municipal KMT authorities dispatched the "Youth Army" to suppress and beat them. Now, all middle schools and universities in the city are actively preparing for a general strike and march. In the face of the severe situation of surging student movements across the country, Zhu Jiahua and the Executive Yuan simultaneously issued written "talks" on the 17th, lamenting that "the national treasury's ability is truly unable to bear the burden" and simply refused the students' and professors' demands for improving their living conditions, and threatened the students that this move would "hinder public order" and would "order the security organs to carry out their duties" to implement suppression. On the 18th, the KMT government further convened a "temporary National Government Committee" and passed "temporary measures" to suppress the current labor and student movements, and attached many articles of the Criminal Code regarding imprisonment and detention to the measures, in order to "inform various agencies, groups, and schools." Fascist head Chiang Kai-shek also issued a bloody cry at the same time, believing that "the strangeness and absurdity of this student movement is unprecedented in any previous period." He angrily condemned the struggle of starving students to fight for survival as exceeding "national morality," "behaving like rioters," being "directly or indirectly instigated by the Communist Party," and roared, "What is the value of such schools to the country, and why should we pity such unrestrained and violent youth," "we must take decisive measures." However, the students completely ignored this criminal law and "admonition." A Jiaotong University student representative told a Reuters reporter, "Whether the State Council's motion is trusted and whether it will work are both questions." According to a French news agency report on the 19th, although the Nanjing Police Department has announced that anyone gathering more than ten people will be dispersed, Nanjing students still announced that they would hold a new mass march and demonstration at the opening of the National Political Council tomorrow. According to TASS, Associated Press, and other news agencies, the reasons for this student movement are: students demand improved living conditions, oppose police beating students, and support the professors' association's demands for increasing funds for books and equipment, prohibiting KMT Sanmin Youth League secret agents from operating on university campuses, and stopping the KMT from using the national treasury to pay for party expenses. (The editor's note added by this newspaper in the fourth line from the bottom of the headline news on the third page on the 18th, "The Chiang authorities unreasonably wanted the school to move" should be "The Chiang authorities unreasonably did not want the school to move." Also, the so-called student movement caused by the "school relocation" issue is just a pretext by the KMT Central News Agency. In fact, students' lives are becoming increasingly difficult due to the economic crisis, and they are demanding improvement. According to Reuters, the strike by students at Shanghai Jiaotong University was clearly also to demand improved living conditions, not what the Central News Agency said about "opposing the change of the school's name.")

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th – The Shanghai Wenhui Daily reported on April 8th: Chiang Kai-shek transferred 4 million US dollars in book and equipment funds allocated by the UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to universities in the KMT-controlled areas to purchase US cotton to fund the civil war. This incident aroused dissatisfaction in the educational circles in the KMT-controlled areas.

### 反对蒋党进行内战剥夺米粮  京沪平青学生罢课

　　反对蒋党进行内战剥夺米粮
    京沪平青学生罢课
    【新华社陕北二十日电】综合各方报导：蒋管区学校之罢课罢教风潮，正随着全国深重的经济危机席卷全国各地。蒋记教育部长朱家骅狂呼“情形日益恶化”。迄十八日为止，专科以上罢课罢教之学校已有南京之中央大学、金陵大学，上海之交通大学、之江大学、沪江大学、复旦大学、大同大学、暨南大学、上海医学院、中法药专，杭州之英士大学，北平之清华大学、北京大学、燕京大学、铁道管理学院、北洋大学、北平师范学院、北平艺专，沈阳之东北大学，青岛之山东大学，开封之河南大学等二十一校。沪杭各校，纷纷赴京请愿，京沪、沪杭等铁路为之阻断。在蒋家皇朝的京都南京中大金大等校亦纷纷示威游行，至教育部、行政院请愿。他们带着“我们要吃！”“内战剥夺了我们的米粮！”等标语，并在教育部的墙上写着有反对内战的口号。当蒋记教育部长朱家骅出来接见学生时，学生们吼叫：“不要再说空话了！”“你晓不晓得我们在挨饿？”并将他包围。示威学生至国府路时，蒋记行政院副院长王云五想对学生讲话，但学生们即对他高唱“你这个坏东西！”（一首在蒋区极为流行的骂奸商贪官的歌曲）。北平之北大、清华等校学生罢课宣传，十八日在西单演讲贴标语时，平市蒋记当局竟出动“青年军”实行镇压毒打，现全市大中学正积极筹备总罢课大游行。在全国学潮澎湃之严重形势下，朱家骅及行政院于十七日同时发表书面“谈话”，哀鸣“现在国库能力委实无法负担”，对学生教授改善生活等要求干脆拒绝，并恐吓学生此举为“妨碍公务秩序”，将“令治安机关执行职务”，实行镇压。十八日蒋政府更召开“临时国府委员会”，通过压制目前工潮学潮的“临时办法”，并在办法后面附上许多条六法全书中徒刑拘役的刑法条文，以“晓谕各机关团体学校”，法西斯头子蒋介石亦同时发出带血腥气的号叫，认为“此次学潮之离奇怪诞为以往任何时期所未有”。对挨饿学生争取生存之斗争大骂为越出“国民道德”，“行同暴徒”，是“共产党直接间接所指使”，咆哮“国家何贵有如此之学校，亦何惜如此恣肆暴戾之青年”，“不能不采取断然之处置”。但学生对此刑法及“诰诫”毫不理睬，交大学生代表于答路透社记者时说：“国务会议案是否为人信任，是否行得通，均是问题”。又据法国新闻社十九日息，虽然南京警察局已宣布凡聚众十人以上者，将予驱散，南京学生仍然宣布要在明日参政会开幕时举行新的群众游行示威。此次学潮之原因，据塔斯、美联等通讯社指出：系学生要求改善生活待遇，反对警察殴打学生及支持教授会对增加图书仪器费，禁止国民党三青团特务在大学校内的活动，和停止国民党从国库中开支党费而起。（十八日第三版头条消息倒数第四行本报所加附注“蒋家当局无理的要该校迁移”应为“蒋家当局无理不要该校迁移”。又按：所谓为“迁校”问题发生学潮，不过是蒋记中央社之饰词，实际上是学生生活因经济危机而日益困窘，要求改善。据路透社消息，上海交通大学学生的罢课，显然也是为了要求生活改善，而不是中央社所说的什么“反对更改校名”。）
    【新华社陕北二十日电】四月八日沪文汇报载：蒋介石将联总拨助蒋管区各大学之图书仪器费四百万美元，移作购买美棉，以充内战经费，此事激起蒋管区教育界之不满。
