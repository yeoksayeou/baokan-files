　　Blackboard News to Strengthen Troop Combat Effectiveness

　　Blackboard news is a creation of our frontline XX Column in the merit campaign and plays a significant role in promoting various tasks. Currently, a large-scale production campaign is being carried out in the rear, and this experience can be flexibly adopted by various localities for running blackboard news based on specific circumstances.

　　Now, a new type of weapon has been invented in the political work of our frontline XX Column. This weapon is very powerful. When a company has it, the company immediately becomes active; when the whole regiment has it, the whole regiment immediately becomes active; when the whole brigade has it, the whole brigade immediately becomes active. What is this weapon? It is blackboard news. Blackboard news is supported and praised by hundreds and thousands of soldiers, who say it is like the sun in spring, writing on the news: "Blackboard news, blackboard news, why didn't you come sooner? If I had known you were coming, I would have wired you to come!" Cadres say that blackboard news is a new method of leadership. With blackboard news, everything is easy, breaking the view that soldiers are incompetent, bad, and backward. The slogan is "When encountering difficulties, go to the masses." It is currently exerting unparalleled power in the merit campaign, pushing the merit campaign to be widespread and in-depth. Coupled with the campaign to find good, remember good, and learn good, in less than a month, it has created a mass movement of officers praising soldiers, soldiers praising soldiers, and soldiers praising officers, giving the troops a new look.
　　Now, here are a few points about the experience of running blackboard news:

　　Organization and Characteristics

　　Blackboard news is like a light cavalry unit, very simple and convenient. When the troops arrive at a place to camp, they erect a door panel in the concentrated area of the unit, and after the manuscripts written by everyone are reviewed by the branch or the editor-in-chief, and the typos are corrected, they are posted on it, and it is considered published. Its editorial department is generally formed with the company branch as the core: the political instructor acts as the president of the newspaper, grasping the central content of the newspaper and the overall work; the cultural cadre acts as the editorial board member, responsible for posting and registering manuscripts, supervising the writing and receiving of manuscripts, and leading the correspondents; the branch propaganda committee acts as the broadcasting committee, responsible for reading, revising manuscripts, and timely commenting on the merits of each squad, platoon, and individual manuscript. All the soldiers and masses of the whole company are its correspondents and readers.
　　Blackboard news has its characteristics and is fundamentally different from some past formalistic wall newspapers: 1. It has broad mass character, and the masses can write whatever they want. A character is fine, a sentence is fine. A square paper is fine, a triangular paper is fine. It can express the opinions of soldiers in the simplest and easiest way. It does not require the writing to be very good or the content to be "extraordinary," which makes the masses daunted. Therefore, some companies have been able to have 83% of the people write manuscripts. 2. Strong reality, no emphasis on form, no need to pay attention to copying, layout, and decoration. Everyone starts writing, and there is no worry about a shortage of manuscripts. It is published quickly. Many units can publish a issue every day during rectification, marching, and combat. What happened yesterday can be reflected immediately, and it immediately promotes today's work. This is fundamentally different from the wall newspaper that takes many days to publish. 3. Taking specific praise as the main content, the content is the specific reflections and opinions within the unit. Through it, it can effectively improve the enthusiasm and creativity of commanders and fighters. 4. Closely combined with the current work and current movement, it directly serves the current struggle, becoming a weapon for everyone's work and study, not a display, not historical documents, not empty treatises... This is the characteristic of blackboard news. Only by grasping this characteristic and running blackboard news can we get rid of formalism and produce taste and effect.

　　How to start it?

　　If you want to start blackboard news, you must have meticulous organizational work, and work hard and patiently to mobilize and organize the masses, and organize the masses into the blackboard news movement. Regarding the effectiveness and experience in this area, a few points are also written below: 1. Military and political leaders must attach importance to it ideologically, and not think it is unnecessary or a burden. After a certain brigade discovered the benefits of blackboard news, it made a decision to establish blackboard news and let every company do it, which had a great effect. 2. Cadres should take the lead in writing and reading newspapers, and launch a few people or a class to start writing manuscripts. Comrade Wang Rongtang, a cultural cadre of a certain Red Army unit, made great efforts to establish blackboard news. When he mobilized soldiers, health workers, and cooks to write manuscripts, some said they were illiterate, and some said they had a low level of education. He said that whatever you want to say, just write it, write what you do, you cook, write about cooking, you do exercises, write about exercises, march, write about marching. If you are illiterate and cannot hold a pen, he will write for them, and after writing, he will read it to everyone. In a few days, the newspaper became lively. 3. The requirements for the quality of manuscripts are low, and the masses are allowed to express themselves freely. As long as there are no principle problems, help to revise it (but don't revise it too much), and try to publish as many manuscripts as possible. A soldier on the blackboard news of a certain special service company simply wrote: "Comrade Zhang Yuhe is very good at ordinary times, works very actively, and has never said a strange word. All the comrades in the class also say that he is good, and he should be given a good record." There are also very simple drawings, first draw a circle, point on the ears, eyes, mouth, and nose, and then draw a large circle below as the stomach, and draw two straight lines below the stomach as legs, carrying two buckets of water, and marking the crooked words: "Comrade Su Wenliang helps the villagers carry eighteen buckets of water every day." It looks very vivid and has great educational significance. 4. Publicize the benefits of the newspaper from the needs of cadres and soldiers, and help the masses solve the difficulties in participating in blackboard news (time, paper, pens, etc.). 5. Timely commend the active comrades in the blackboard news work. "I would rather sleep less, but I can't not run the blackboard news." A soldier was not afraid of fatigue during days of marching, and was still writing manuscripts when others were sleeping. A squad leader had to write manuscripts after returning from leading a class in the middle of the night. He said: "If I don't send it tonight, I won't be able to publish it tomorrow morning." These vivid facts were all praised in the blackboard news, and their photos were also taken, and their enthusiasm was even greater. 7. Be sure to read the newspaper so that the newspaper has practical effects and arouses the interest of the masses. A barber wrote a manuscript, but the cultural cadre forgot to read it. He said angrily: "I won't write it. The cultural cadre doesn't read mine. Is what I wrote not good!" The cultural cadre immediately apologized to him, and he was happy.
　　Although this kind of work of mobilizing the masses is very difficult and troublesome, when the blackboard news is truly established through efforts, its role is great, and the cadres will feel that the leadership is "more worry-free."

　　Ten Benefits

　　Blackboard news has ten benefits: 1. Record good deeds in a timely manner and promote righteousness. In the past, many people in a certain camp said strange things. Zhang Wenming, the head of the machine gun squad, was a king of strange words, and he had the idea of ​​eating. After the complaint movement, he changed a little, and the blackboard news immediately praised him. He was very happy when he saw it, and he became even better. Later, he helped others study, and everyone gave him a good record again. He became more active and said: "Mischief doesn't work, the superiors can see clearly, who doesn't want to get a good record, come to the merit book to make contributions!"
　　2. Improve awareness and improve culture. Peng Xuechang, a barber in a camp, had his father beaten to death by traitors. After complaining, he wrote on the blackboard news: "Resolutely do it to the end and avenge my father!" Improving his class awareness. Twelve illiterate comrades in the battalion headquarters were able to write manuscripts within half a month. The entire barber class did not know a single character. After finding a clerk to write for them, they copied them. After ten days, each person could recognize at least thirty characters, and some even recognized ninety characters. Said: "Blackboard news should have come earlier, I would have become a cadre earlier."
　　3. Broadcast news and exchange experiences. The victory in Shandong had just been transmitted from the telephone to the regimental headquarters. Before it was published, Wang Guodong, the telephone operator of the special service company, ran to the company headquarters and asked the instructor if he could write it? After the instructor allowed it, he wrote an article saying, "I heard good news that Shandong has eliminated seven enemy divisions." When the instructor read it to everyone, all the soldiers in the company jumped up excitedly. A certain company had difficulty in recording good deeds and did not have time. The machine gun squad introduced the experience and wrote: "We find good and remember good when we wash our feet, which only takes five minutes." Later, the whole company learned from them.
　　4. Self-criticism and ideological struggle. Zhang Liangchen, a communications class in a certain camp, was very naughty, nicknamed "Firecracker." The whole class had opinions on him. Once, during a march, others got eight blisters on their feet and did not take a car, but he got two blisters on his feet and sat in the car. Wei Desheng and Lu Yushan jointly drew a big car and let a little rabbit pull it. A child sat in the car, spitting out two lines to represent speaking: "My name is Firecracker, I like to sit in a car." Zhang Liangchen, who had never blushed before, blushed this time. The next day, during the Battle of Laotian'an, he automatically delivered letters more than ten times and carried a wounded soldier, correcting his idea that "the rogue hangs around and eats well."
　　5. Help leadership and understand the situation. A soldier in a certain battalion wanted to desert, and he reflected on himself and realized that it was wrong. The cultural cadre wrote an article on the blackboard news to praise him, and then five comrades made reflections and did not desert.
　　6. Encourage each other and enhance unity. The cavalry class never dismounted during marching in the past. Once, Shi Fanyu and Sanbianzui allowed the sick soldiers of the infantry to ride horses, and Xu Wenrong wrote a manuscript to praise them. After that, the cavalry class not only let the sick soldiers ride horses during the march, but also carried guns for the sick soldiers, enhancing unity.
　　7. Promote work and transform backwardness. During the grievance campaign in a certain camp, everyone was afraid to make plans during the determination stage. The blackboard news first published a few people who made plans, and most of them followed suit and made plans. After a certain battalion published blackboard news, it transformed forty-eight backward comrades, of which twenty-one became activists.
　　8. Mass evaluation, clear merits and demerits. A barber in a certain camp said: "The Eighth Route Army is different from the past. If you have a good deed, everyone will record it for you and let the superiors know. If you have a good deed, you will be praised. Why make trouble!" A platoon leader was recorded as a major good deed in the Battle of Laotian'an because of his bravery. But the next day he slept soundly, and a soldier wrote: "Platoon leader, you are good, but you don't get up and don't run. These areas must be overcome."
　　9. Launch competitions and set off a boom. Before the march, the barber class in a certain camp proposed a competition to the camp headquarters and published it in the blackboard news: "Don't talk during night marches, and guarantee three no-gos and no desertions." All the camp headquarters responded to the challenge. As a result, both sides did it well and won.
　　10. Publicize propositions and realize leadership. During the complaint in a certain camp, the following big characters were written on the blackboard news: Turn tears into strength. Everyone made plans to kill the enemy. Before the march, it was proposed that everyone should study hard, learn from good deeds, and record more good deeds during the march. As a result, cooks and grooms did it. After the blackboard news was established, whatever the superior party advocated and opposed, everyone followed suit and advocated and opposed.

　　加强部队战斗力的门板报
    门板报是我前线××纵队在立功运动中的创造，对于推动各种工作作用很大。目前后方正在开展大生产运动，这一经验各地办黑板报亦可根据具体情况灵活加以采用。
     ——编者
    现在我们前线××纵队的政治工作上，发明了一种新式武器，这个武器很厉害，连队里有了它，连队便马上活跃起来；全团有了它，全团便马上活跃起来；全旅有了它，全旅便马上活跃起来。这个武器是什么？就是门板报。门板报得到成百成千的战士拥护和赞扬，说它象春暖花开的太阳一样，在报上写着：“门板报，门板报，你为什么不早来，早知你下生，通电把你叫！”干部说，门板报是新的领导方法，有了门板报，一切都好办，打破了战士无能、战士不好、战士落后的观点。口号是“遇到困难，找群众去”。它在立功运动中，正发挥着无比的力量，通过它，把立功运动推向普遍、深入，配合着找好、记好、学好运动，不到一个月的功夫，造成官表扬兵，兵表扬兵，兵表扬官的群众运动，使部队换了一个新面貌。
    现在这里谈几点办门板报的经验：
    组织和特点
    门板报象轻骑部队一样，非常简单、方便。部队每到那里宿营时，就在本单位集中的场所，竖起一块门板来，把大家写的稿子，叫支部或编辑主任看看，修改一下错字白字，贴在上边，就算出版了。它的编辑部，一般都是以连队支部为核心组成的：政指当报社主任，掌握报纸中心内容及全盘工作，文干当编辑委员，负责张贴登记稿子，督促写稿与收稿，领导通讯员；支部宣委当广播委员，负责阅读，修改稿子，及时评论每班、排及个人稿子的好坏。全连队的战士群众，都是它的通讯员和读者。
    门板报有它的特点，和过去一些形式主义的墙报根本不同：一、它有广泛的群众性，群众能写啥写啥。一个书也可，一句话也可。四方纸也可，三角纸也可，它可以用最简单易做的形式，表达战士的意见。它不要求字写的多好，内容如何不“平凡”，使群众望而生畏。所以有的连队，已能有百分之八十三的人写稿子。二、现实性强，不重形式，不用讲究缮写、排版、装饰。大家动笔，不愁稿荒，出的快，很多单位能在整训、行军、作战中每天出一期，昨天的事，马上能反映出来，对今天的工作马上便有推动。这和摆布多少天才能出上一期的墙报是根本不同的。三、以具体的表扬为主要内容，内容是本单位以内的具体反映与意见，通过它可以有力的提高指战员的积极性与创造性。四、与当前的工作、当前的运动紧紧结合，直接为当前的自己的斗争服务，成为大家工作学习的武器，不是摆设，不是历史文献，不是空洞论著………这就是门板报的特点，把握住这个特点去办门板报，才能摆脱形式主义，干出味道和效果来。
    怎样才能办起来？
    门板报要想办起来，必须有细致的组织工作，艰苦耐心的去发动群众组织群众，把群众组织到门板报运动中来。关于这方面的成效与经验，也有几点写在下边：一、要军政首长思想上重视，不要认为不必要，认为是负担。某旅发现门板报的好处后，就把建立门板报作了决定，让每个连队都搞，收效很大。二、要干部带头写稿读报，突击几个人或一个班开始写稿。红字部队某营文干王荣堂同志，为了建立门板报，下尽苦功。他发动战士、卫生员、伙夫写稿时，有的说不识字，有的说文化水平低，他说想说啥就写啥，干什么写什么，你做饭写做饭，你出操写出操，行军就写行军。不识字，不能拿笔的，他就替他们写，写好后就对着大家念。不几天把报纸闹得红火起来。三、稿件要求水准低，放手叫群众表现，只要没有原则毛病，帮助改一下（也不要改的太多），有稿尽量登出。某特务连的门板报上一战士简单的写道：“张玉河同志在平时很好，工作很积极，没说一次怪话，全班同志也说他好，该给他记好一次。”还有很简单的图画，先画一个圆圈，点上耳、目、口、鼻，下边再画一个大圆圈算作肚子，肚子下边画上两根直线就是腿，担了两个水桶，上边标着歪歪扭扭的字：“苏文亮同志每天帮助老乡十八担水。”看看非常生动，教育意义很大。四、要从干部战士需要上来宣传报的好处，帮助群众解决参加门板报的困难（时间、纸张、笔等）。五、要及时表扬门板报工作中的积极同志。“宁愿少睡一会觉，不能不办门板报”，一个战士在连日行军中，不怕疲累，在别人睡觉时还在写稿。一个班长半夜带班回来还要写稿，写好后半夜送走。他说：“今天晚上送不到，明天早晨登不了。”这些生动事实都在门板报上予以表扬，还给他们照了象片，他们的劲头更大了。七、一定要读报，使报纸发生实效，引起群众兴趣。一位理发员写了一篇稿子，文化干事忘了读，他很生气的说：“我不写了，文化干事不读我的，我写的不好吧！”文化干事马上向他陪错，他才高兴。
    这样的发动群众的工作虽然是很艰苦麻烦，但经过努力把门板报真正办起来时，它的作用大了，干部就会觉得领导“省事”多了。
    十大好处
    门板报有十大好处：一、及时记好，发扬正气。某营过去讲怪话的很多，机枪一班张文明是个怪话大王，脑子里存在着混饭吃的思想，诉苦运动后，稍有转变，门板报上立刻表扬了他。他看见很高兴，越发变好了。后来他又帮助别人学习，大家又给他记好一次，他更积极了，说：“调皮不管用，上级看得清，谁不愿落个好，记好簿上来立功！”
    二、提高觉悟，提高文化。一营理发员鹏学昌，父亲被汉奸打死，诉苦后在门板报上写道：“坚决干到底，为父亲报仇！”提高了他的阶级觉悟。营部十二个不识字的同志，半月内能写稿了。理发班全班一个字不识，找文书代写后，套着仿写，十天后，每人最低能识三十个字，有的竟认到九十个。说：“门板报要早来，我早当了干部。”
    三、广播消息，交换经验。山东大捷刚从电话上传到某团部，未发表前，特务连电话员王国栋，就跑到连部问指导员能写不能写？指导员允许后，他就写了一篇稿“我听到一个好消息，山东消灭敌人七个师”，指导员向大家一念，全连战士都兴奋的跳起来。某连记好发生困难，没有时间，机枪班就介绍经验，写道：“我们在洗脚时候找好记好，只用五分钟”，全连后来都向他们学习。
    四、自我批评，思想斗争。某营通讯班张良臣，很调皮，外号叫“火里蹦子”，全班对他有意见，有一次行军，别人脚上打了八个泡不坐车，他脚上打了两个泡就坐在车上。魏得胜和卢玉山伙画了一辆大车，让一个小兔拉着，车上坐个小孩，嘴里吐出两条线代表说话：“我叫火里蹦子，我好坐车。”从来不脸红的张良臣这回脸红了。第二天打老田庵站，他自动送信十多次，背伤员一名，纠正了他那“吊儿郎当怪吃香”的思想。
    五、帮助领导，了解下情。某营一个战士想开小差，自己反省出来不对，文干就在门板报上写了一篇稿表扬了一下，接着有五个同志都作了反省，不开小差了。
    六、互相勉励，增强团结。骑兵班过去行军永不下马，有一次石凡玉和三扁嘴让步兵病号骑马，徐文荣就写稿表扬。以后骑兵班行军，不但让病号骑马，还替病号背枪，增强了团结。
    七、推动工作，改造落后。某营诉苦运动到下决心阶段，大家都不敢订计划。门板报上先登出几个订计划的，大部都跟着订了计划。某营出门板报后，改造过来四十八个落后的同志，其中二十一个成了积极分子。
    八、群众评议，功过分明。某营理发员说：“现在八路军和过去不一样了，有一点好，大家就给你记上，让上级知道，有好就表扬，还闹问题干啥！”一个排长在老田庵战斗中，因勇敢记了一大好。但第二天他睡了大觉，一战士写稿道：“二排长，好是好，就是不起床，不跑步，这些地方要克服。”
    九、发动竞赛，掀起热潮。某营行军前理发班向营部提出竞赛，在门板报上发表：“夜行军不说话，保证三不走，不逃亡”。全营部都应了战。结果都做到了，双方优胜。
    十、宣传主张，实现领导。某营诉苦，在门板报上写着大字：把眼泪变成力量。大家都订了杀敌计划。行军前提出人人要学好，见好就学好，行军中多记好。结果伙夫、马夫都做到了。门板报建立以后，上级党主张什么，反对什么，大家也就跟着主张什么，反对什么。
