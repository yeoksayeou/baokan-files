[Benbao Jilu Yuqianxian 27th Electric] (Late arrival) Reporter Wu Xiang reports: A certain regiment of the Field Army, known for its defense of Zhangfengji, once again wedged into the depths of the Chiang army at Jingzhai, 30 miles northwest of Junxian, during the Yubei Campaign. They persisted for a day amidst the encirclement and finally won a counterattack victory. On the night of the 16th, the People's Liberation Army launched a full-scale counterattack against the Chiang army's northward offensive. The regiment arrived at its designated location and discovered that the Chiang army was fleeing. They pursued fiercely southward overnight and, before dawn, searched to Jingzhai, making contact with a small number of Chiang troops. This village is low-lying, with over a hundred households, long east-west and narrow north-south, located on the rear side of the Chiang army's large corps. The regiment launched an attack from the southeast, and the Chiang army retreated into two tall buildings, stubbornly resisting from the heights. Before the battle was resolved, Chiang troops from Zhangzhai, two miles south of the village, and Yuanshang, three miles east of the village, were dispatched, swooping down from high positions. The regiment was attacked from both front and rear, and the terrain was unfavorable, but they remained extremely calm. They ordered one unit to continue the attack, while the rest, braving Chiang's artillery fire, quickly built fortifications to meet the enemy. The Chiang army, seeing the well-organized formation, dared not advance lightly, and the remnants stubbornly resisting in the buildings were wiped out. By 12:00, the overall battle situation became even more tense. The Chiang army deeply felt that the regiment's wedge into their depths posed too great a threat to them. They fiercely bombarded Jingzhai again and dispatched a regiment of the 199th Brigade from Zhangzhai and a regiment of the 41st Division from Yuanshang to attack forward with the cooperation of Chiang's aircraft. For a time, smoke and dust filled the south of the village, and the sound of gunfire was as rapid as dense rain. At this time, the heroes shouted: "Carry forward the tenacious spirit of the Zhangfengji battle and resolutely do not lose the position!" Everyone said: "Good! Let these bastards taste the pain!" The Chiang army charged to the graves fifty meters away, but hesitated to advance further. The brave warriors aimed and fired, killing and wounding many of them. Taiwan warrior Jia Xinwu shot down three with three shots, and the Chiang army abandoned corpses and retreated in defeat. Then the enemy charged again for the second time. At this time, the situation was extremely critical. The front line in front of the Damao Temple in the southeast corner of the village was the most strained, and the Eighth Company, which was firmly defending that area, was also the most tenacious. The little hero Lü Dengke automatically joined another class to fight after his entire class was wounded. Later, he himself was wounded, but still resolutely refused to leave the front line. The Chiang army charged and fought for four hours, suffering heavy casualties, and failed to seize a single position, so they had to abandon corpses and retreat again. The First Company launched a mobile attack and captured Zhangzhai. By this time, dusk was approaching, and the Chiang army on the eastern front began a full-scale collapse.

　　坚守张凤集的英雄们在浚县西北又获大胜
    【本报冀鲁豫前线二十七日电】（迟到）记者吴象报导：以坚守张凤集之战著称的野战军某团，此次豫北战役中又在浚县西北三十里之景砦楔入蒋军纵深，在夹击中坚持一日，最后反击获胜。十六日夜间，人民解放军全线反击北犯蒋军，该团抵达预定地点，发现蒋军逃窜，连夜向南猛追，拂晓前搜索至景砦，与蒋军少数部队接触。此村低凹，有百余户，东西长而南北窄，位于蒋军大兵团之背侧。该团由东南两面一举攻入，蒋军退入两座高楼，据险顽抗。战斗尚未解决，村南二里之张砦，村东三里之原上，皆有蒋军出动，居高临下扑来。该团背腹受敌，地形不利，但仍极沉着，命一部继续攻击，其余则冒着蒋军炮火，迅速构筑工事应战。蒋军见阵容严整，不敢轻进，据楼顽抗之残部遂被消灭。迨十二时，全线战事更趋紧张，蒋军深感该团楔入纵深，对他们威胁太大，复猛烈炮击景砦，并由张砦出动一九九旅一个团，原上出动四一师一个团，在蒋机配合下向前攻击。一时村南烟尘弥漫，枪声急如密雨。这时英雄们就叫道：“发扬张凤集战斗的顽强精神，坚决不丢阵地！”大家都说：“好！让这些混蛋来尝尝厉害！”蒋军冲至五十米坟堆间，迟迟不敢再进。勇士们瞄准射击，将其杀伤极多。台湾战士贾新吾，三枪放倒三个，蒋军遗尸败退。接着敌人第二次又冲过来，此时危急万分，村东南角大庙前沿最吃紧，而固守该处之第八连亦最顽强；小英雄吕登科在全班负伤后，自动加入别班作战，后自己又受伤，仍坚决不下火线。蒋军冲杀四小时，伤亡惨重，未夺得一处阵地，只得再次遗尸败退。一连机动出击，攻占张砦。至此，天已薄暮，东路蒋军遂开始全线溃崩。
