Our Army Recovers Thirteen County Towns, Actively Annihilates the Enemy on Four Major Railway Lines

In the week from April 19th to 26th, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) swept across the four major railway trunk lines in North China, achieving significant victories and recovering thirteen county towns including Tai'an, Yongji, Yuxiang, Wenxi, Jiexian, Linjin, Mengxian, Huoxian, Zhaocheng, Dong'e, Banyin, Juye, and Jiaxiang. The PLA continued to expand its gains victoriously on the Tongpu, Zhengtai, and Pinghan railways. The heroic divisions under Generals Chen Yi and Su Yu also swung westward, launching a massive offensive on the Jinpu Railway.

From April 22nd to 26th, the East China People's Liberation Army completely annihilated three brigades of the Kuomintang (KMT) 72nd Division and recovered Tai'an, marking the beginning of the summer offensive of our East China forces. The victory at Tai'an completely shattered Chiang Kai-shek's illusion of opening up the Jinpu Railway, leaving the isolated city of Jinan besieged on all sides. The Associated Press also stated that the KMT's loss of Tai'an "will postpone the war by a year." However, it should not be forgotten that this is only a prelude to the war. The development of the war will make it impossible for Chiang Kai-shek to catch his breath, and ultimately lead him to his demise.

The Jin-Sui Military Region People's Liberation Army, after annihilating a part of the 10th Brigade of the Xi'an Garrison, which was Hu Zongnan's reinforcements crossing the river on the 22nd, immediately seized the opportunity to recover the cities of Linjin, Yuxiang, Yongji, Wenxi, and Jiexian, and gained control of Fenglingdu, the throat of the three provinces of Shanxi, Henan and Shaanxi, and the important artery of Chiang and Hu. The People's Liberation Army has now controlled 400 *li* of the Tongpu Railway (leaving only Anyi and Yuncheng as isolated cities), liberated seventeen new county towns (including Huoxian and Zhaocheng), and important ferry crossings such as Yumenkou, Fenglingdu, Wuwangdu, and Daqingguan. Tongguan and the Longhai Railway are now under our firepower threat, and Xi'an and Luoyang are simultaneously shaken.

Hu Zongnan's army, trapped in the mud of northern Shaanxi, is still unable to extricate itself. The Northwest People's Liberation Army, pursuing the nine brigades reinforcing the 135th Brigade, annihilated more than 1,000 men from the 29th Army on the 19th. The mass guerrilla warfare is developing vigorously, and the prediction that "the occupation of Yan'an marks the demise of Chiang Kai-shek" is gradually being confirmed by facts.

The Jin-Cha-Ji Military Region's main forces advanced into the eastern section of the Zhengtai Railway, recovering Niangziguan, a strategically important gateway to Shanxi and Hebei, on the 24th, and recovering Mengxian on the 26th, controlling more than 200 *li* of the railway from Yangquan to Huolu. Shijiazhuang is still under siege by our army. Chiang Kai-shek was forced to transfer three divisions and one brigade to reinforce southward. As of the 26th, they were still wandering around Zhangdeng and Ranhetou, north of Wangdu, and their fate of destruction is awaiting them.

On the Ping-Han Railway north of Beiping, the People's Liberation Army continues to severely strike the KMT army. The two cities of Tangyin and Anyang have become turtles in a jar. The entire KMT army in northern Henan is in danger of being completely annihilated. Chiang Kai-shek has not sent a single soldier to reinforce them. The Central News Agency's so-called "National Army's correct strategic deployment" is merely a cover-up for its disastrous defeat.

The KMT army is being beaten everywhere and is overwhelmed. The local armed forces of the People's Liberation Army are actively attacking in various places. The local armed forces in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area advanced into the KMT rear and successively recovered Juye, Jiaxiang, Pingyin, and Dong'e. The Dazhongji campaign in central Jiangsu was an outstanding victory in the KMT rear, connecting northern and central Jiangsu. In Rehe, our army recovered Songshuzhuzi, an important town on the border of Rehe and Liaoning.

The Associated Press called the victorious offensive of the People's Liberation Army "an astonishing resurgence of Chinese Communist military activity in Shanxi, Hebei, Henan, and Shandong," thus "shattering" the "hopes" of those who thought that "the occupation of Yan'an meant the end of the Chinese civil war began"; this cannot help but remind people of Chiang Kai-shek's arrogant clamor after the occupation of Yan'an. However, in no time at all, the enemy's camp was thrown into chaos in the face of the first blow of the People's Liberation Army, and even Li Zongren, the director of the Beiping Pacification Headquarters, had to resign due to "illness."

### 我军收复县城十三座  主动歼敌四大铁道线

专栏：一周综合战报

　　我军收复县城十三座  主动歼敌四大铁道线
    四月十九日至二十六日一周间，人民解放军驰华北四大铁路干线，取得重大胜利，收复泰安、永济、虞乡、闻喜、解县、临晋、盂县、霍县、赵城、东阿、半阴、巨野、嘉祥等十三座县城。解放军在同蒲、正太、平汉等铁路线上乘胜继续扩张战果；陈毅、粟裕将军麾下雄师又挥戈西向，在津浦线上展开巨大攻势。
    华东人民解放军从四月二十二日至二十六日，全部歼灭蒋军七十二师的三个旅，收复泰安，标志着华东我军夏季攻势的开始。泰安之捷，使蒋介石打通津浦的幻想完全破灭，济南孤城四面楚歌。美联社也说：蒋军失去泰安“将使战争推后一年”。可是不要忘记这仅仅是一个序战，战争的发展，将使蒋介石无法喘气，最后走向死亡。
    晋西南人民解放军于二十二日歼灭胡宗南过河增援的西安警备部队第十旅一部后，旋即乘胜收复临晋、虞乡、永济、闻喜、解县诸城，掌握秦晋豫三省咽喉蒋胡重要输血管的风陵渡。人民解放军现已控制同蒲铁路四百华里（只留安邑、运城二处孤城），新解放县城十七座（包括霍县、赵城），及重要渡口禹门口、风陵渡、吴王渡、大庆关等多处，潼关与陇海路已在我火力威胁之下，西安、洛阳同时震动。
    陷入陕北泥坑中的胡宗南军狗腿，至今欲拔不能，西北人民解放军追击增援一三五旅的九个旅，十九日又歼灭二十九军一千余人。群众游击战争猛烈发展，“占领延安标志着蒋介石的灭亡”的预言，正逐渐为事实所证实。
    晋察冀大军挺进正太东段，二十四日收复晋冀门户天险娘子关，二十六日收复盂县，控制阳泉至获鹿二百余华里铁路。石家庄仍在我军围困中，蒋介石被迫抽调三个师一个旅南下增援，截至二十六日仍徘徊在望都以北张登、冉河头一带，覆灭的命运正在等待着他们。
    像北平汉线上人民解放军继续痛击蒋军，汤阴、安阳两城已成瓮中之鳖。整个豫北蒋军有全部被歼危险，蒋介石至今尚无一兵一卒前来增援，中央社所谓“国军运用正确战略”云云，只不过为其惨败遮丑而已。
    蒋军到处挨打，顾此失彼，人民解放军地方武装在各地主动出击，冀鲁豫区地方武装挺进蒋后，连续收复巨野、嘉祥、平阴、东阿；太岳区收复霍县、赵城。苏中大中集战役，更是蒋后杰出的一次胜利，使苏北苏中连成一片。在热河，我军则收复热辽界上重镇松树咀子。
    人民解放军的胜利攻势，美联社称之为：“中共军在山西、河北、河南、山东军事活动的惊人的复发”，因而“打破了”那些以为“占领延安意味着中国内战结束开始”的人们的“希望”；这不禁使人记起蒋介石在占领延安后的狂妄叫嚣。然而曾几何时，在人民解放军第一个打击面前便已阵营混乱，连北平行营主任李宗仁也要因“病”辞职了。（新华社陕北卅日电）
