　　Improving Rural Theater Troupes
    Huang Mei

    After watching the People's Theater Troupe's performance and participating in the symposium, I learned a lot. The history of this troupe alone can well illustrate on what foundation the new drama of the people is growing. Of course, their members are themselves peasants, so they have very favorable conditions for portraying peasants. But without these two points:

    1. Uniting and transforming the old folk artists, taking folk forms (Xiangyuan Yangko local opera) as the foundation, and absorbing many elements of spoken drama.

    2. Closely integrating with the struggle and quickly reflecting reality.

    In other words, without such a foundation: creating a form that the masses love to see and hear to express the struggle of the masses, it would not have been possible to progress from the old "Fuleyi" opera troupe to today's People's Theater Troupe, and it would not have been possible to become the "banner of rural theater troupes." Looking back at the better rural theater troupes in Taihang and Taiyue, all those who are warmly loved and supported by the masses are like this!

    But despite this, some rural theater troupes often deviate after developing, and even take completely opposite paths. This is where the so-called "improvement" problem arises. After a certain period of development, rural theater troupes must improve, not only do they want to improve themselves, but the masses also want you to improve. However, there should be a distinction between rural theater troupes in general villages and professional rural theater troupes. For example, professional rural theater troupes are much improved compared to general village rural theater troupes. This is because: 1. Professionalization promotes the regularity of performances. 2. On the one hand, to perform in various places, performing full-length plays is necessary, which makes acting and directing more skilled. This is one of the important objective reasons for their improvement. And general village rural theater troupes should not try to emulate professional rural theater troupes. For example, some village rural theater troupes now spend surprisingly large sums of money to buy scenery, costumes, and curtains, and often perform large-scale dramas, such as "Blood and Tears仇" and "The White-Haired Girl." This is actually a kind of detachment from reality; unfamiliarity with life, unskilled acting, and insufficient manpower make it impossible to produce good results. On the contrary, it is better to perform local events in the village, simply and plainly, reflecting quickly, and combining with village work to achieve great success.

    For example, if a professional rural theater troupe completely emulates certain army cultural troupes, not focusing on reflecting the reality of the region, but performing general large-scale dramas, the result is also a detachment from reality, just like our cultural troupes emulating large cities, not focusing on reflecting the liberated areas but performing general large-scale dramas, the result is the same. This cannot be called improvement. This so-called "improvement" is all detached from its own foundation, that is, it does not focus on forms that the masses love to see and hear, nor does it focus on reflecting the struggle of the masses. This kind of improvement cannot come from the masses and return to the masses, and it certainly cannot be reversed to guide popularization. This kind of improvement is completely wrong. Sometimes, the continued development of this tendency will even lead to a focus on old acting skills and a沉湎 in old plays. This phenomenon has now been discovered in Taihang: some professional rural theater troupes perform more old plays than new plays, and perform old plays with more enthusiasm than new plays (of course, partly because of catering to the audience and making money). Recently, I saw a material (see Rural Letters No. 2): A village in Xiangtangpu, She County, spent 280,000 yuan to hire an old opera teacher. The detailed situation and reasons are not clear, but the occurrence of this phenomenon is very alarming in any case.

    Therefore, if professional rural theater troupes do not take the correct path of improvement, not only will they have a very bad influence on village rural theater troupes, but the troupes themselves will also inevitably face stagnation and backwardness, and they will form a new "opera troupe." Performing is for the purpose of production, and since it is for the purpose of production, it is sometimes inevitable to cater to the audience's tastes, be requested to perform certain plays, and be requested to see certain actors; and actors may also revert to some old habits in their lives. For example, a theater troupe performed in Licheng for three days and charged more than 100,000 yuan. When performing, they had to send wine and dishes to the stage and throw peanuts and red dates. After three days of performing, the total expenditure was more than 300,000 yuan. Isn't this also an alarming phenomenon?

    Therefore, today, the issue of improving rural theater troupes, is probably more important in terms of political and ideological improvement! (Artistic improvement is of course also necessary, but without political and ideological improvement, artistic development will inevitably be limited.) That is, to make the original good style, closely integrated with the struggle, and quickly reflecting reality, be further promoted, but to improve the ideological nature of creation, and strive to express the masses' struggle more deeply, more typically, and more vividly and lively.

    How to help rural theater troupes, especially professional rural theater troupes, improve politically and artistically, is an urgent issue. There are many specific issues, which require everyone to study carefully. I think it is very good that some leading organs first help them solve some living problems, so that they have a period of rest in the middle of the year, and strengthen political education. In addition, if literary and artistic workers with considerable cultivation put down their burdens and join their troupes, and truly help them sort out and summarize their experiences with a humble learning attitude, and jointly study and create, that would be even better! Our peasant writer Zhao Shuli has repeatedly talked to me about this issue, he himself has this desire, and he very much hopes that comrades can go and do this!

    In the past, I often thought: If the work and learning exchange and influence between the cultural troupes of the army and higher organs, the professional rural theater troupes, and the village rural theater troupes can be correctly coordinated and harmonious, I think the drama movement in the border area will be further promoted in the future, and it will also be an improvement for these three types of theater troupes. This kind of improvement also has a mass base. Unfortunately, these three links have not been well integrated to this day!

    After watching the performance of the People's Theater Troupe, I also heard everyone talking about the issue of improvement at the symposium. Recently, I learned about the situation of some rural theater troupes from Comrade Xia Qing's letters from the countryside, and my thoughts on improvement became active again.

    The Xiangyuan People's Theater Troupe has a very good tradition and style, and has a good mass base. I hope that after they go back, they can truly act as the "banner of rural theater troupes," improve themselves, and at the same time improve the general rural theater troupes. If one or two of the things I have talked about can be used as a reference, then I will be satisfied.

### 农村剧团的提高

　　农村剧团的提高
    荒煤
    看了人民剧团的戏，又参加了座谈会，学习到不少的东西。单从这个剧团的历史来看，也可以很好的说明：人民的新戏剧是在一个什么样的基础上生长起来的。固然，他们的团员本身就是农民，所以他们表现农民占有着非常优越的条件。但如果没有这两点：
    一、团结与改造了民间旧艺人，以民间形式（襄垣秧歌地方戏）为基础，吸收了话剧的许多东西。
    二、密切与斗争结合，迅速反映现实。
    换句话说，如果没有这样一个基础：创造一种为群众喜见乐闻的形式来表现群众的斗争，那么，就不可能从“富乐意”旧戏班子进步到今天的人民剧团，也就不可能成为“农村剧团的旗帜。”回顾一下太行太岳的较好农村剧团，凡是受到群众热烈的爱戴与拥护的，莫不如此！
    但尽管是这样，有些农村剧团得到发展以后，却往往会有偏差，甚至走完全相反的道路的。这就是发生了一个所谓“提高”的问题。农村剧团经过一定的发展，必须提高，不仅自己要求提高，群众也要求你提高。但一般村的农村剧团与职业化的农村剧团是应该有区别的。例如，职业化的农村剧团较之一般村农村剧团就提高了许多，这是因为：一、职业化促成演出的经常性。二、一方面为了跑台口非排大本戏不行，这就使得演技与编导方面更加熟练。这是客观上促成他们提高的重要原因之一。而一般村农村剧团就不应该向职业化农村剧团看齐了。如现在有些村农村剧团以相当可惊的巨款购买布景、服装、幕布，动不动就排演大戏，如血泪仇白毛女等，这其实也是一种脱离实际；生活的不熟悉，演技的不熟练，人力的不足，都无法产生很好的效果的。反之，倒不如演本村实事，简单朴素，反映迅速，与村工作结合，而获得很大的成功。
    再如职业化的农村剧团，如果完全向部队某些文工团看齐，不着重反映本地区现实，而演一般的大戏，其结果也是一种脱离实际，如同我们文工团去向大都市看齐，不着重反映解放区而演一般的大戏，其结果是一样的。这都不能叫作提高。这种所谓“提高”都是脱离了自己的基础的，即不以群众喜见乐闻的形式为主，也不以反映群众斗争为主。这种提高既不能从群众中来还回到群众中去，又一定不能反转来指导普及，这种提高就完全错了，有时，这种倾向的继续发展，甚至会从单纯的追求旧的演技而沉湎旧戏。现在太行已经发现这样现象：有一些职业化的农村剧团演旧戏比新戏多，演旧戏比新戏起劲（当然一部分是因为迎合观众以及生产赚钱的原因）。最近看到一个材料：（见农村来信其二）涉县向堂铺一个村子就以二十八万元去请一个旧戏教师。详细的情形及原因还不清楚，但发生这种现象无论如何是非常惊人的了。
    因此，职业化的农村剧团如果不走向正确的提高的道路，非但对村农村剧团发生很坏的影响，剧团本身也一定产生停滞与落后的危机，就会形成一个新“戏班子”。演戏是以生产为目的，既以生产为目的，有时即难免不迎合观众的趣味，被点戏，被点角；而演员在生活上也就可能恢复些旧毛病了，如有个剧团在黎城演戏三天，索价十余万元，出演时，要往台上送酒菜，抛花生红枣，三天戏下来，共开销三十余万元。这不也是一个可惊的现象么？
    所以，今天农村剧团的提高问题，更重要的恐怕是在政治上与思想上的提高罢！（艺术上的提高当然也须要，但没有政治与思想上的提高，艺术上发展就必然受到限制。）也就是要使得原来的好作风，密切与斗争结合，迅速反映现实这个作风更大加发扬，不过要提高创作的思想性，求得表现群众斗争的更深入、更典型、更生动活泼。
    如何帮助农村剧团，特别是职业化的农村剧团在政治上、艺术上提高一步，是一个迫切的问题。其中具体问题很多，须要大家来好好研究一下。我觉得象现在有些领导机关首先帮助他们解决一部分生活问题，使他们在一年中间有所休整的时期，加强政治上的教育；这就很好。另外，如果有相当修养的文艺工作者放下包袱参加到他们剧团里去，真正以虚心学习的态度去帮助他们整理与总结一下经验，共同研究与创作，那就更好！我们的农民作家赵树理同志曾一再与我谈到过这个问题，他自己有这个愿望，而且非常热烈地期望有同志能去这样作！
    过去我常想：部队上及较高机关的文工团、职业化的农村剧团、以及村农村剧团这三方面之间的工作学习的交流与影响，若能够正确的取得协调和融洽，我想今后边区的戏剧运动当更向前推进一步，而且对于这三方面的剧团也都是提高一步。这种提高也才是有群众基础的。可惜这三个环节到今天还没有很好地结合起来！
    看了人民剧团的戏以后，在座谈会上也听到大家谈到提高的问题，最近又从夏青同志自乡间的来信了解了一些农村剧团的情形，我那种提高的思想就又活跃起来了。
    襄垣人民剧团的传统与作风都很好，并且有很好的群众基础，希望他们回去以后，能真正作到“农村剧团的旗帜”，把自己提高一步，同时把一般农村剧团提高一步。我所谈的这些，其中若还有一两点可供参考，则为愿已足。
