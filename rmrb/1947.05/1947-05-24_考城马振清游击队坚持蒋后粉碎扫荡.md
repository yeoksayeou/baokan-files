　　Kaocheng Ma Zhenqing Guerrilla Unit Persists Behind Enemy Lines, Crushing Sweeps After Chiang
    [This newspaper's Ji-Lu-Yu dispatch of the 22nd] The Kaocheng Ma Zhenqing Guerrilla Unit relies on tunnels to crush sweeps and persist in the struggle behind enemy lines. Ma is the director of the county's Armed Forces Committee. Since Chiang's die-hard troops occupied Kaocheng, he has never left the area. During the enemy's third "sweep," the enemy's × regiment, in coordination with local bandits, launched a massive three-pronged attack on our central area from the southwest. The Ma Zhenqing Guerrilla Unit met them head-on with a volley of shots, stopping the enemy's advance. The masses in the surrounding villages, hearing the gunfire and receiving intelligence, prepared for "clearing the fields" and counter-"sweeping." The guerrilla unit completed its task of blocking the enemy's advance and then moved to another area. Once, Ma Zhenqing, with two signalmen, chose a position in × village, on the front line of the enemy's attack, and calmly waited for the enemy to arrive. They fired a volley of shots, and the enemy company commander fell first. The Chiang troops behind him then launched a fierce attack on the village. After the enemy entered the village, the Ma Zhenqing Guerrilla Unit had already moved their position through the tunnels. The Ma Zhenqing Guerrilla Unit became even more active at night, ambushing enemy-occupied villages everywhere, making the exhausted enemy restless. One day, as dawn broke, the enemy in the village discovered that two sentries at Erdaogang had been stabbed to death and their guns were gone. The enemy discovered the village where our guerrillas were staying and surrounded it. The guerrillas ran out of the village, the enemy chased them, and the guerrillas ducked into a cave. The enemy stared at the cave, helpless. The Chiang troops forced the local bandits to go down, and the local bandits forced the home-returning corps to go down, but none of them dared to go down. The enemy lit sorghum stalks and stuffed them into the cave, trying to smoke them out, but they had already safely left through another cave entrance.

　　考城马振清游击队坚持蒋后粉碎扫荡
    【本报冀鲁豫二十二日电】考城马振清游击队依托地道，粉碎扫荡，坚持敌后斗争。马系该县武委会主任，自从蒋顽军占领考城后，他始终没有脱离过该地区。敌人第三次“扫荡”时，敌×团配合土顽，由西南分三路浩浩荡荡向我中心区进攻，马振清游击队迎头给敌人一排子枪，敌人进攻停止了，周围几个自然村的群众，听到枪声，又传来了情报，就做了“空室清野”及反“扫荡”的准备。游击队完成了阻击敌人前进的任务即转移了地区。一次马振清带着两个通讯员，就在敌人进攻的正面×村选好了位置，沉着的等待敌人来到，拍拍一排子枪，敌连长应声先倒，后面蒋军便向该村展开猛攻，敌人进村后，马振清游击队早从地道里转移了阵地。马振清游击队到夜里更加活跃，敌占住村到处打冷枪，使疲惫的敌人坐卧不安。有一天村里敌人在天发亮的时候，发现二道岗两个哨兵被刺死，枪也没有了，敌人发现了我们游击队住的村庄，就向该村包围，游击队跑到村外，敌人追到村外，游击队一低头进了洞，敌人望着洞没有办法，蒋军逼土顽下，土顽逼还乡团下，结果他们谁也不敢下，敌人燃着秫秸填进洞里，企图用烟火熏死他们，但他们早从另一个洞口安全的走了。
