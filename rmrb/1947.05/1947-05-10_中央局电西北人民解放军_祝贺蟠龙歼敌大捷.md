　　Central Bureau Cables Northwest People's Liberation Army
    Congratulating on the Great Victory in Panlong

    [This newspaper's special dispatch] The CPC Jinji-Luyu Central Bureau sent a telegram to the Northwest People's Liberation Army on the 8th, congratulating them on the great victory in recovering Panlong and annihilating the entire 167th Brigade of the Chiang army. The original telegram stated:

    To all commanders and fighters, and all comrades of the Northwest People's Liberation Army: The great victory in Wayaobao on the 14th of last month created a turning point in the war situation; only 20 days later, we annihilated the entire 167th Brigade of the enemy in the Panlong area, seizing countless supplies, and recovered Panlong, giving the deeply entrenched enemy a severe blow on its long supply line. This glorious victory further proves that the Chiang-Hu army, trapped in the quagmire, cannot salvage its defeat! A special telegram is sent to express congratulations and condolences.

    祝贺蟠龙歼敌大捷
    【本报特讯】中共晋冀鲁豫中央局八日致电西北人民解放军，祝贺收复蟠龙歼灭蒋军一六七旅大捷，原电称：
    西北人民解放军全体指战员、全体同志们：上月十四日瓦窑堡大捷，造成战局之转折点；甫经二十日，又在蟠龙一带歼敌一六七旅全部，缴获无算，并收复蟠龙，给深入之敌在其漫长的补给线上以严重的打击。这一辉煌胜利，益加证明陷入泥坑的蒋胡军无法挽救其败绩！专电驰贺，并致慰问。
