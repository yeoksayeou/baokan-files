　　【Our newspaper's Yu-bei Frontline dispatch, 4th】The 1039th unit convened a grand merit celebration conference on the 22nd at their garrison. The brigade leaders personally attended and awarded Comrade Zhang Laifa, a people's hero, a silver kill-the-enemy hero medal. A total of 14 people were awarded. In his speech, the brigade leader emphasized that Comrade Zhang Laifa is an outstanding military commander who can maintain a calm mind in critical situations, carefully handle the situation, and come up with solutions for everyone, ultimately turning danger into safety. He called on all personnel to learn from him. The speech also encouraged the heroes not to be proud and complacent, but to add more merits to their achievements. Then, the brigade representative presented a flag and read the congratulatory message, and the brigade's political propaganda team sang a merit celebration ditty and the "Resourceful and Courageous Zhang Laifa" quick rhythmic talk. Finally, Comrade Laifa expressed his determination to annihilate more enemies in the actions to defend Chairman Mao. He announced his plan to kill the enemy, guaranteeing that in the next two months, he would lead his entire platoon to complete all the tasks assigned by the higher authorities, capture at least 12 guns and 17 prisoners, carefully study the situation, and use wisdom to defeat the enemy. Under the call to learn from Zhang Laifa, various units of the 1039th unit have successively formulated merit plans. The Qin Qizhong Company planned to guarantee the entire company would capture 1,400 rounds of ammunition, two machine guns, 35 rifles, and 51 prisoners. The Wei Renlong Platoon, a kill-the-enemy hero, challenged the Zhang Laifa Platoon, guaranteeing that each person would capture one gun and one prisoner. The Wang Quanke Model Mutual Aid Group stated that they had received an award for completing their task last time, but they could not be complacent and should humbly learn from Zhang Laifa. They re-formulated their plan: capture three prisoners, seize three guns, resolutely complete all tasks, and ensure that they will not be confused in any situation, violate battlefield discipline or mass discipline, or lose their color number.

    【Our newspaper's Yu-bei Frontline dispatch, 4th】 The frontline troops' newspaper, "Battlefield," recently published an editorial praising and calling for: learning from the highly class-loving spirit of Comrade Pan Jinsheng, who, though wounded, carried a seriously injured comrade off the firing line. Comrade Pan Jinsheng was liberated from the Zhang Fengji battle last year, but he quickly became a strong people's fighter, embodying in all aspects the high political qualities of a people's fighter. In the recent battle of Xiguan in Tangyin, Comrade Pan and another soldier, Li Jingyu, were simultaneously wounded by an enemy shell. Jinsheng's forehead was injured, and Jingyu was more seriously injured, with holes blasted in four places on his body. The enemy's gunfire was still raging wildly, there were no stretchers nearby, and the area was tightly sealed off by enemy fire. Revolutionary weapons were bought with the blood of comrades, and where a person is, there must be a gun; wounded comrades must never be abandoned. Therefore, Comrade Jinsheng disregarded his own pain, hung a rifle on each arm, carried Comrade Jingyu on his back, and also carried two foreign shovels, a foreign pickaxe, five hand grenades in his belt, and held one in his hand, the fuse hung on his finger, and walked while saying: "Come on! The two of us won't die, we'll exchange you two first." Finally, he carried Comrade Jingyu to the aid station. When the medics saw that he was also wounded, they insisted on keeping him in the hospital. He felt that if he stayed in the hospital, he would not be able to fight and earn merit, so he casually excused himself, saying, "The higher-ups didn't know when I came down, so I have to go back and explain!" He took advantage of the opportunity to run back to the troops.

    张来发指挥有方受表扬
    潘金生带彩抢救重伤同志

    【本报豫北前线四日电】前线部队《战场》报，顷以社论表扬并号召：向带彩还背重伤员下火线的潘金生同志高度的阶级友爱的精神学习。潘金生同志，是去年张凤集战斗解放过来的，但他很快就成为坚强的人民战士，从各方面都体现着他是具备着作为一个人民战士的高度政治品质的。此次汤阴西关战斗中，潘同志和另一个战士李景玉在敌人打过来的一颗炮弹下，同时挂了彩，金生炸伤了头额，景玉的伤更重，身上四个地方都炸有窟窿，敌人的枪炮声还在疯狂的响着，身边既没有担架，四处都被敌火力封锁的紧紧地。革命的武器是拿同志的鲜血换来的，人在就得枪在，负伤的同志更是绝对不能丢掉。于是，金生同志丝毫不顾忌自己的伤痛，两臂各挂一支步枪，背上背着景玉同志，还扛着两把洋锹，一把洋镐，腰里夹着五颗手榴弹，手里还拿了一个，火线挂在指头上，边走边说：“来吧！我俩死不了，就要先换你两个。”终于把景玉同志背到了救护所。卫生员见他也负了伤，坚要留他住院，他觉得住了医院就不能打仗立功了，顺口推脱说：“下来时上级不知道，得回去交代一下才行！”乘空就又跑回了部队。
