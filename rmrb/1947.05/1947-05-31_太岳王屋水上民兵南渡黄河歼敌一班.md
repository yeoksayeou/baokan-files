A six-man commando team led by Zhao Anbang and Zhang Jinhe crossed the Yellow River and stormed into the Songjia Village stronghold in Mianchi County. First, they shot and killed the enemy sentry, and then engaged in a fierce battle with the enemy. The militia on the north bank shouted and cheered, frightening the enemy into fleeing desperately.
