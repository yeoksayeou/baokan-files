　　Xiyang Mobilizes All and Partial Labor Force for Precise Division of Labor, Seizing Time for Crash Planting
　　[Report from our newspaper in Xiyang] After the production mobilization conference, the entire county entered a busy period of participating in the war. The labor force required for war participation, logistics, and other tasks across the county reached × ten thousand people. The remaining full and partial labor force in the county was less than half, leading to temporary chaos and stagnation in production. The leadership immediately used a combination of organized action and vigorous appeals: on one hand, it loudly proclaimed slogans like "Down with Little Chiang, Defeat Old Chiang, Men and Women, Young and Old, Produce Together, Do What You Can"; on the other hand, it accurately calculated to get through ideological issues, with cadres and activists taking the lead in organizing the masses for production. According to statistics from one district in the Sixth Area and five villages in the First and Second Areas, 3,400 auxiliary laborers were involved in the production movement within two days. For example, in Hongshui Village in the Second Area, out of 298 households with 3,500 mu of land, there were 151 full laborers and 60 partial laborers. 130 full laborers participated in the war, leaving 21 full laborers and 60 partial laborers. With 50 pairs of oxen and 50 donkeys, they could manage hauling manure but not plowing the land. After accurate calculation and ideological clarification, a total of 200 auxiliary laborers were organized, specifically for hauling manure, freeing up 50 people who could plow the land. The village had 20,000 loads of manure yet to be delivered, which was completed in eleven days. Besides the 800 mu of land already plowed, each of the 50 pairs of oxen plowed an average of 2.5 mu per day, completing the spot plowing in ten days, reserving 1,500 mu of grain land. With a total of 70 oxen and donkeys, each plowed an average of 3 mu per day, completing the plowing in seven days. In this way, the whole village can complete the planting task on schedule. From the perspective of the entire county, auxiliary laborers are universally involved in the spring plowing and planting movement. From 73-year-old men to 10-year-old children, some carrying, some lifting, some clearing stubble, production enthusiasm is unprecedentedly high. The entire county, without hindering participation in the war, will ensure the completion of spring plowing and planting within ten days after Little Fullness.
