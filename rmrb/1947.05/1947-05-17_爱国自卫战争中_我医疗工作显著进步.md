　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th -- In the Patriotic Self-Defense War, the medical and treatment work in various liberated areas has made considerable progress and significant contributions. The East China Field Hospitals are using plaster bandages extensively, shortening the recovery period by one-third. The Jiaodong Hygiene Laboratory has developed a serum protein that, after separation, can be stored at a temperature of over 50 degrees Celsius for a year. This invention allows fresh blood donated by the masses in the rear to be continuously transfused to the soldiers at the front. The glucose production of the Xinhua Pharmaceutical Factory of the Jin-Cha-Ji Military Region's Health Department has surpassed its highest record in Zhangjiakou. A certain rear hospital in the Northeast has adopted new methods for treating war wounds, with a maximum mortality rate of no more than one percent. The number of wounded soldiers returning to the front lines, in just three months of statistics, has reached 75 percent. The medical community in Harbin has voluntarily formed a medical team consisting of more than 70 renowned doctors and over 200 nurses, who take turns working at the front lines.随军护士滕新胜在靠山屯战斗中，坚持在火线上给一重伤战士进行包扎工作，直至三次受伤壮烈牺牲. Teng Xinsheng, a nurse attached to the army, insisted on bandaging a seriously wounded soldier on the front line during the Battle of Kaoshantun until he was wounded three times and died heroically. Li Kerang, a doctor from Anze County, Taiyue, organized twelve doctors into four groups to accompany the participating masses to the front lines, ensuring that 90 percent of the masses completed their participation tasks in good health.
