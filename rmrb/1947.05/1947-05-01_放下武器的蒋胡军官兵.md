Chiang-Hu Officers and Soldiers Who Laid Down Their Weapons
　　They are in Transition
　　Generally, the Hu Zongnan officers and soldiers who are liberated usually believe that they will be beheaded after being captured due to Hu Zongnan's long-term deception and education. However, when they come into contact with the People's Liberation Army, many people's doubts and misunderstandings are immediately cleared up. Some were relieved as soon as they saw the slogans about treating prisoners well.
　　As early as the Liangzhuang battle in Guanzhong, Zhao Haiquan of the 368th Regiment, who laid down his weapons, said: "When I laid down my weapons, I was very scared, but someone came to shake my hand, which surprised me very much." Zhao Shicai, the battalion commander of the 31st Brigade, said: "After being captured and brought to the Commissioner's Office, the person in charge dispelled the doubts with an explanation. There were more than 70 of us captured together, and not a single one deserted." Xu Guohui, a platoon leader of the 368th Regiment, was very fearful when he was captured. It wasn't until he heard the leaders of the New Fourth Brigade talk about the lenient policy that he understood that he wouldn't die. Zhao Wanshui, an artillery platoon leader, deserted on a momentary impulse. After running dozens of miles away, he regretted it. He thought, "People are so good to me, why should I desert?" So he ran slower and slower, and because he was unfamiliar with the mountain roads, he fell off a cliff. Later, he simply walked on the road, waiting to be caught again. Later, he was indeed caught back. He thought, "This time I'm finished." As a result, he was not punished because he confessed his mistake. He said with deep gratitude, "It's really unexpected that my life is not in danger this time."
　　Many liberated officers and soldiers were most impressed by our certain brigade. Xu Guohui was amazed by the combat effectiveness of the brigade in the Liangzhuang battle, which was beyond his expectations. He said: "The best troops of the Kuomintang are actually not comparable to a certain brigade." He said that he would very much like to work in that brigade in the future, no matter what he does. Kong Yunqi of the 48th Brigade said: "The people of a certain brigade speak sincerely and kindly and treat people like friends." They praised the People's Liberation Army's mobile tactics, the speed of information, especially the high morale, and the relationship between the army and the people. Platoon Leader Zhao Fangshui said: "No one is guarding the stretcher team, and not a single one runs away." "As soon as they arrive in the village, someone boils water, and the young women don't avoid the army." Kong Yunqi said: "Here, the common people dare to talk to the army casually, but outside, the common people's voices tremble when they talk to the army." They compared their own experiences on both sides and realized how far apart they were.
　　Battalion Commander Yang Shicai asked fifteen old people on the road, of which fourteen fully supported the Eighth Route Army, and only one said that his burden was heavier, because he was an old-fashioned landlord with twenty cave dwellings that had not yet been transformed. In addition, he found that doing things for the liberated areas was always guaranteed. He saw that the doctor at the reception center was a cripple and was given a horse to ride as a privilege. He said: "If it were in the Kuomintang area, he would be scolded endlessly even if all five organs were intact." In fact, this is not only the case for their own cadres, but also for the wounded and sick prisoners. Among them, Special Agent Chief Song Jie had blisters on his feet, and the reception center also gave him a horse to ride. Another officer said: "You live ten years less in the Kuomintang, and ten years more here. Because everyone here lives a lively and happy life." Another person, after seeing the cooperation between the army and the people here, recalled how uncomfortable he felt when they killed the common people's cattle for food in Jinpen Bay. Cui Gang, a soldier who participated in the work, said: "The Eighth Route Army is so good, why shouldn't I ask for a job?" According to a preliminary statistic from a team at the reception center, about 80% of the people asked to participate in the work. As early as on the battlefield, 90% of the soldiers had already joined the People's Liberation Army to fight. (Xinhua News Agency Northwest Electric)
　　
　　Li Jiyun had to admit: The strength of the Border Region is indeed great and different from the Chiang area

　　Li Jiyun, the major general and brigade commander of the 31st Brigade of the Chiang-Hu army captured in the Qinghuabian battle, had many feelings on the way to the rear of northern Shaanxi. One day, Li borrowed needle and thread from a peasant woman to sew a button on his clothes. The peasant woman mistakenly thought he was a member of the Eighth Route Army and said kindly: "You have worked hard for the people fighting Hu Zongnan. I will sew it for you." Li immediately lowered his head in shame and had nothing to say. When the peasant woman realized that Li was the murderer who attacked the border area, she also left angrily. One day, Li encountered hundreds of stretchers going to the front line in a team, all with high spirits. He also encountered groups of peasants evacuating grain from warehouses, each carrying more than a hundred kilograms. Some people said to Li: "We will never let the Hu army eat a grain of food from the border area." On the way, he repeatedly saw organized self-defense forces on guard. This made him have to admit that the strength of the border region was great and indeed different from the Chiang area. His initial "general" arrogance when he first saw the people in the border area was nowhere to be found. Li was also dissatisfied with Hu Zongnan, and often said: "Commander Hu usually treats his subordinates unfairly." Because Li was a graduate of the third term of Huangpu, while his division commander Wang Yingzun was a graduate of the fifth term of Huangpu. (Xinhua News Agency Shaanxi Electric)
　　
　　Mai Zongyu said: I didn't expect to be treated so well. You are so kind to us here.
　　
　　The reporter met with Major General Mai Zongyu, acting brigade commander of the 135th Brigade of the 55th Division of the Hu army, Colonel Cheng Yaohuang, commander of the 405th Regiment, and Major Zhou Xingru, commander of the 2nd Battalion of the regiment, at the front-line headquarters. Major General Mai Zongyu looked tired and dispirited, but he pretended to be calm when talking to the reporter. They were all wearing gray khaki American army officer uniforms and big caps. Only the gold hat badges were removed. The battle that day was so fierce that the Hu army officers did not have time to follow Chiang Kai-shek's secret instructions to "change into soldiers' uniforms in times of crisis" before they were captured alive. Major General Mai Zongyu was short, with a dark yellow face, about forty years old, from Zhongshan County, Guangdong, and a graduate of the fourth term of Huangpu. He said: "My first impression after entering the border area was that I didn't see any common people, and all I saw were continuous yellow earth mountains." When talking about his first feeling after coming here, he repeatedly said: "I didn't expect to be treated so well. You are so kind to us here." Speaking of the current civil war, Major General Mai sighed and said: "I don't want to fight a civil war." Two days ago, he was still an arrogant Hu army major general, but now he is speaking very carefully, fearing that he might say something wrong. (Hai Leng)

### 放下武器的蒋胡军官兵

　　放下武器的蒋胡军官兵
    他们在转变中
    一般被解放的胡宗南官兵们，平常在胡宗南长期欺骗教育影响下，都以为被俘后一定要杀头。但当他们一接触到人民解放军，许多人的怀疑和误解立即就扫清了。有的先看到优待俘虏的标语就已放心了。
    早在关中梁庄战斗时，放下武器的三六八团赵海泉说：“一放下武器正害怕时，结果有人来和我握手，真使我惊喜极了。”三十一旅营长赵世才说：“被俘来到专员公署，经负责人一解释就打消了怀疑。我们一块被俘的有七十多人，连一个也没有开小差”。三六八团排长徐国辉被俘时很恐惧，直到听新四旅首长讲宽大政策后才了解死不掉。有一个因一时糊涂开了小差的炮兵排长赵万水，一跑出去几十里路后就悔悟了。他想人家对自己那样好，为什么要开小差？于是他越跑越没劲，加上山路不熟，曾一下子滚下崖来。后来索性在大路上走起来，等着再捉回去。后来他果然被捉了回来。他想“这次一定完了”。结果由于他坦白认错，并没处罚他。他深深感激地说：“这次没有生命危险，真是万想不到”。
    许多被解放的官兵，都对我某某旅留下最深刻的印象。徐国辉在梁庄战役中惊奇该旅战斗力的强，出乎他的意料之外。他说：“国民党最好的军队实际上也比不起某某旅”。他表示将来很希望到该旅去工作，不管做什么都愿意。四十八旅孔运奇说：“某某旅说话态度都诚恳和霭待人像朋友一样。”他们对人民解放军的运动战术，消息灵，特别是士气旺盛和军民关系，赞美不止。赵方水排长说：“担架队没有人押着，连一个也不跑。”“一到庄上，就有人烧开水，年青的女人们见了军队也不躲避。”孔运奇说：“在这边老百姓敢向军队随便讲话，在外边老百姓向军队讲话声音就打颤”。他们把自己切身经验两边一比，知道相差太远了。
    杨世才营长在路上曾问过十五个老百姓，其中十四个满口赞成八路军，只有一个说他负担重些，原来那是一个有二十孔窑洞还没有改造的旧式财主。另外他发现给解放区做事永远有保证。他看到招待处的医生是个跛子，受优待有马骑。他说：“假如是在国民党区五官不全挨骂不完。”其实这也不仅对自己干部如此，就是对被俘过来的伤病号也是是同样优待。他们之中特务长宋杰脚上打了泡，招待所也给他一个马骑。另一个军官说：“在国民党那边少活十年，在这边多活十年。因为这边大家都是活泼愉快的生活着。”还有一个看到这边军民合作后，想起当他们在金盆湾杀老百姓的牛吃当时心里很不舒服。一个参加工作的士兵崔刚有说：“八路军这样好，我还不要求工作干什么？”据此招待所一个队初步统计：约有百分之八十的人要求参加工作。而早在战场上，已有百分之九十的士兵参加解放军作战了。（新华社西北电）
    李纪云不得不承认：边区力量伟大确与蒋区不同
    青化砭战斗被俘之蒋胡军卅一旅少将旅长李纪云，在其抵达陕北后方途中颇多感触。某日，李向一农妇借针线缝衣扣，农妇误认他是八路军，亲切地说：“你们为老百姓打胡宗南辛苦了，我来替你缝。”李顿时愧然低头，无话可答。当农妇省知李为攻打边区的凶手时，亦拂然而去。又一日，李在途中遇数百付担架结队奔赴前线，个个精神焕发。又遇成群结队农民疏散仓库粮食，每人背负达百余斤。并有人对李说：“我们决不让胡军吃边区一粒粮食。”途中又屡见有组织之自卫军站岗放哨。使其不得不承认边区力量伟大，确与蒋区不同。其初见边区人民时的那种“将军”臭架子已不知去向矣。李对胡宗南亦不满，常称：“胡长官平素对待部属不公。”因李为黄埔三期生，而其师长王应尊则为黄埔五期生。（新华社陕北电）
    麦宗禹说：想不到会如此优待我们这边对我们实在太好了
    记者在前线指挥部会见了最近放下武器的胡军五十五师一三五旅代旅长麦宗禹少将、四○五团团长成耀煌上校，及该团二营营长周行儒少校。麦宗禹少将面带疲惫，精神萎顿；但与记者谈话时故作镇定。他们均穿着灰色卡矶美式陆军军官制服，戴着大盖帽子。只是摘去了金帽花。那天的战斗这样激烈，以致胡军军官还来不及遵照蒋介石的秘密指示“在危急时换上士兵制服”就被活捉了。麦宗禹少将矮个子，黑黄脸，约四十岁，广东中山县人，黄埔第四期毕业。开口便说：“我进边区以后的第一个印象就是不见老百姓，四望都是连绵不断的黄土山。”谈到过来以后的第一个感想时，他连声说：“想不到会如此优待我们，这边对我们实在太好了。”提起目前的内战，麦少将慨叹说：“我是不希望打内战的。”两天以前还是傲慢的胡军少将，现在说话特别小心谨慎，深恐把话说差了。（海棱）
