　　Lubao Summarizes 100 Days of Textile Production: Village Exceeds Task by Over 1,000 Jin

[This Dispatch from Licheng] The Lubao Village has successfully completed its 100-day textile plan, exceeding the target by more than 1,000 jin. The fundamental experience is: during the organization and implementation of the movement, women were given relatively widespread and profound ideological mobilization for production. Based on this production consciousness, all women were widely organized to implement the plan on schedule, with timely summaries, commendations, and mutual work exchange methods.

The task proposed by the 100-day textile movement was 5,320 jin. Some people thought the number was too large and feared they couldn't complete it, while others had thoughts of resting. The leadership first focused on solving ideological problems, convening meetings of women's rescue cadres, textile heroes, and activists for everyone to deliberate and discuss. Liu Wenping said, "The higher-ups are doing this for us and won't want our cloth. Because we didn't do textile production last winter when we overturned [the old order], a foot of cloth costs over 200 yuan at the market, while a jin of cotton only costs 300 yuan. If we don't do textile production well, we won't be able to change our clothes for the season this spring, and we won't be able to uproot our poverty." Textile hero Lu Chongxi said, "Don't be afraid of the large number. As long as we have the spirit of overturning the old order last winter, we can mobilize our wives and mothers. I guarantee that I can mobilize Auntie Fa to join the group and learn to spin." Women's rescue chairperson Han Chunfeng said, "I guarantee to mobilize Auntie Changhai." Through young and middle-aged women activists, an ideological mobilization was launched among the broad masses of women, focusing on those who were lagging behind, with the slogan: "To get rich, sell cloth, don't sell cotton," and "Every household can change clothes for the season without buying cloth." After Lu Zhiping's thinking was cleared, he went to mobilize the old lady Li Shu, bringing a spinning wheel to his home to spin. While spinning, he enlightened him with profitable examples, making him active. When Li Shu was able to spin two liang of cotton a day, he was immediately commended, and immediately ten more old ladies were encouraged. The 67-year-old Zhang Jun said, "An eighty-year-old man can reclaim wasteland; as long as he doesn't die, he lives for the moment. We won't add a jin, but we'll add two liang." The number of women in the village greatly increased, with 25 new children under the age of twelve, 26 old ladies over the age of fifty-five, and nine old men. A total of 293 people, new and old, participated in textile production and work exchange organizations, divided into three brigades and nineteen groups. The mutual aid and work exchange method was: everyone should do what they are good at and contribute their abilities. When Lu Chongxi was making military shoes, he discussed with everyone, "It takes ten workdays for us young people to make a pair. How can we spin six liang of cotton a day? Auntie Huazhen can make a pair in six and a half workdays, and they are better than what we make. She only spins two liang of cotton a day. It's better to exchange work." Once the work was exchanged in the first month of the lunar year, 54 pairs of shoes were made, saving 304 workdays and producing 150 jin more yarn. The old men sat idle on the streets, so they were mobilized to help shake the cotton thread. Lu Eren and other nine old men were patiently organized to participate in textile production and cotton thread shaking. Shaking one jin of cotton thread was exchanged for spinning two liang of yarn. Statistics from four old men participating in cotton thread shaking showed that 50 textile workdays were saved. Lu Gengren happily said, "Incidental work exchange can also help us change clothes for the season." Each mutual aid group adopted the method of "daily planning, work exchange within the group" to distribute cotton in turns, and according to the skill level, they voluntarily set the number of textile production. Cotton was distributed early in the morning of the first day, and yarn was collected and cotton was distributed again early in the morning of the second day. If something happened at home and they didn't spin, they would help each other by one or two liang or half a liang within the group, and they were not separated from their families. Four liang of the first grade was equivalent to ten work points, five liang of the second grade was equivalent to ten work points, and six liang of the third grade was equivalent to ten work points. At 40 days, the brigades competed in finished products, exchanged experiences, selected heroes, posted lists, and awarded bonuses, proposing the slogan: "Improve technology, increase quantity, and ensure that people, machines, and spindles are not idle." Recent calculations show that 6,377 jin have been completed, exceeding the target by 1,057 jin. Compared with last year's agricultural income, the income from 100 days of textile production accounted for 27.3% of the annual agricultural income. After summarizing the achievements and experiences, the women of the village became more clear that textile production can make them rich. Liu Xilan said, "Another 100 days of textile production is better than farming for a year." Three textile heroes, including Lu Chongxi, and 19 activists emerged. Everyone automatically put forward the slogan: "The 100-day plan is difficult to complete; machines and spindles must not be idle; add oil on top of oil, and work on top of work." Each group has successively formulated a half-year plan to increase textile production, combining the current production of military shoes for seasonal change (work exchange), and each person increases production by another 690 jin of cloth per day.

　　路堡总结百日纺织  全村任务超过千斤
    【本报黎城讯】路堡百日纺织计划胜利完成，并超过任务千斤以上。其基本经验是：运动组织与开展中对妇女进行了较普遍而深刻的生产思想发动，在这种生产自觉的基础上，将全体妇女广泛的组织起来，按期实行计划，及时总结表扬与相互变工的办法。
    百日纺织运动提出的任务是五千三百二十斤，有的认为数目太大怕完不成，有的有歇一歇思想。领导上先重视解决思想问题，召开了妇救干部、纺织英雄、积极分子会，大家酝酿讨论。刘文平说：“上级是为咱，不会要咱布，因去冬搞翻身没纺织，集上一尺布就二百多元，一斤花才三百元，要不好好纺织，今春就换不了季，咱的穷根也拔不了。”纺织英雄路重喜说：“不怕数目大，只要有去冬翻身的精神，下功动员老婆儿就行，我保证动员有法妈参加组，学会纺花。”妇救主席韩春凤说：“我保证动员常海妈。”通过青壮妇女积极分子，在广大妇女中，展开思想动员，重点是面向落后，提出口号是：“要想发家，卖布不卖花”，“家家换季不买布”。路芝平思想打通后去，去动员老太婆李属时，搬上纺车到他家纺，一面纺，一面用得利启发他，使他积极起来，当李属能做到一天纺花二两后，立即抓紧表扬，马上就又有十个老太婆鼓起了劲，六十七岁的老婆张俊说：“八十老儿来开荒，不死一日过时光，咱就不添斤也添个两”。全村纺妇大大的增加起来，新参加十二岁以下的儿童二十五人，五十五岁以上的老太婆二十六人，还有九个老汉，新旧参加纺织变工组织的共计二百九十三人，分为三个大队十九个小组。互助变工办法是：人尽其材，各尽其能。路重喜做军鞋时和大家讨论说：“咱青年人做一双需十个工，一天怎也能纺六两花，华珍妈六个半工就能做一双，比咱做的又好，他一天才纺二两花，这就不如变工好。”正月变了一次工，做鞋五十四双就省了三百零四工，多纺线一百五十斤，老汉们街上闲坐，动员他们帮助抖线，耐心组织了路二仁等九个老汉，参加了纺织抖线，抖一斤变工纺二两线，从四个老汉参加抖线统计省出纺织工五十个，路庚仁高兴的说：“捎带变工，也还能换季。”各互助组采用了“当日计划，以组变工”办法轮流发花，根据把式好歹，自愿订出纺织数目，头天早晨发花，第二天早晨收线再发花。如家中有事没有纺，组内你一两他半两互相帮助，和家庭也不脱节，头等四两顶十分工，二等五两顶十分工，三等六两顶十分工，到四十天时，各大队比赛了成品，交流了经验，评选英雄，挂榜发给奖金，提出：“提高技术，增加数量，做到人车机三不闲”的口号。最近计算已完成六千三百七十七斤，超过了任务一千零五十七斤。与去年农业收入比较：百日纺织收入占全年农业收入百分之二七点三。经过总结成绩和经验，全村妇女更明确了纺织能发家致富。刘喜兰说：“再来一个百日纺织，比种一年地还强”。涌现出纺织英雄路重喜等三人，积极分子十九人，大家自动提出口号：“百日计划难完成，车机不闲还要动，油上加油，功上加功。”各个组纷纷订出半年增纺计划，结合当前作军鞋换季（变工），每人每日再增产布六百九十斤。（培义、秀山）
