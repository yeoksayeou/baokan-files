　　[Report from the Taiyue Front, May 12th] Over seven hundred liberated soldiers voluntarily requested to join the People's Liberation Army and held an oath-taking ceremony to enlist in a certain liberated area last month on the 22nd. Residents from nearby villages all brought gifts to participate, and twenty to thirty women representatives presented each liberated soldier with flowers. Slogans shook the sky, fully demonstrating the determination of the liberated soldiers to avenge and perform meritorious service. Liberated soldier Hu Xiangting said: "We are captives, but the leaders and fellow villagers do not treat us as captives. Today, you warmly send us off and comfort us. If we don't wholeheartedly serve the people, we will be letting you down." Finally, amidst the deafening sound of drums and music, they marched to the front lines.

　　晋南七百解放战士自动要求参加我军
    【本报太岳十二日电】解放战士七百余人，自动要求参加人民解放军，并于上月廿二日在解放区某地举行宣誓入伍。附近各村群众均携带礼物赶来参加，有二三十位妇女代表给每个解放战士戴花，一时口号震天，充分表现出解放战士复仇立功的决心。解放战士胡相廷说：“我们是俘虏，首长们、老乡们不把我们当俘虏看待，今天又是热烈的欢送我们，慰劳我们，我们再不诚心诚意的为人民服务，就对不起你们了。”最后在震耳的鼓乐声中走上前线。
