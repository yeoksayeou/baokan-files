Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 25th: A village in the central area of Guanzhong Partition, Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, persisted in land re-investigation during the self-defense counter-attack war. Three thousand mu of land have been reasonably distributed to poor peasants, and land certificates have been issued. During the re-investigation, the village organized a land appraisal committee to register land door-to-door, dividing all the land in the village into three grades: plain land, dry land, and irrigated land. During distribution, adjustments were made according to population and living needs to achieve a relatively average land quality and quantity. After calculation, each person could get four mu. The method of drawing good to compensate for bad and drawing bad to compensate for good was used to ensure that each person obtained dry land, plain land, and irrigated land. In order to take care of poor peasant families with small populations, it was stipulated that single men should be allocated land for two people, households with two people should be allocated land for three people, and households with four or more people should be allocated four mu of land per person according to the size of the population. Families with more livestock and labor were allocated more distant land, while those without livestock or with less labor were allocated more nearby land. At the same time, the families of military personnel, demobilized soldiers, tenant farmers, and widowed elderly were also taken care of. For example, Mi Xier, a military dependent, received sixteen mu of land, while Zhou Wancai, a demobilized soldier, received nine mu of high-quality land. Cai Suo'er, a tenant farmer, received two mu of irrigated land and six mu of mountain land. Those who made meritorious contributions in the war were also rewarded. For example, Dong Rui rescued wounded soldiers three times under artillery fire in a certain battle. During this land distribution, everyone unanimously agreed to allocate him an additional four mu in addition to the mu he was entitled to.

[Another Dispatch] New Ning and other places are launching a movement to extract contracts and destroy debts. After the land reform in the fifth village of the second district of the county, although the peasants obtained more than 1,000 mu of land, the contracts and old debts were still kept by the landlords who refused to hand them over. On the first day of the third month of the old calendar, at the struggle meeting in Song Village, the peasants unanimously demanded that the landlord Song Baiyou hand them over. Li Shengjin, who had been a tenant in Song Baiyou's family for 41 years, said, "I paid debts to Song Baiyou's grandfather, and they still haven't returned the contract to me after so many years. This is the root of poverty for poor people, and we must take it out today!" On the spot, the masses shouted, "Landlord, quickly bring out the old contracts!" But Song Baiyou still tried to deny it. The crowd was furious and searched him out of his sheep pen. It was brought to the meeting, and the chairman read out the list of indebted households on the old account on the spot. When the whole crowd heard the names of their ancestors, they were all resentful of the landlord's viciousness. After reading it, it was immediately burned.

　　陕甘宁关中分区战争中坚持分田
    【新华社西北二十五日电】陕甘宁边区关中中心区一乡，于自卫反击战中仍坚持土地复查。已有三千亩土地合理分配给贫苦农民，并发了土地证。复查中该乡组织了土地评判委员会，挨门登记土地，把全乡土地分为川地、麻地、水地三等，分配时按人口与生活需要互相调剂，以达到土地质量与数量相当平均。经计算每人可得四亩，以抽好补坏，抽坏补好调剂办法，使每人均获得麻地、川地与水地，为照顾贫苦农民家庭人口少，规定：光身汉分两口人的土地，一户两口者分三口人的地，四口人以上者按人口多少每人分地四亩，牲口和劳动力多的多分远地，没牲口或劳动力少的多分近地。同时又照顾了军属、退伍军人、雇农和孤寡老人等。如军属米喜儿一人分得十六亩，退伍军人周万才一人分得九亩上等地，雇农蔡锁儿一人就分了二亩水地和六亩山地。对参战有功的也有奖励，如董瑞在某次战斗中冒炮火抢救伤员三次，这次分地时大家一致同意除他应分的亩数外，多分四亩。
    【又讯】新宁等地刻展开抽约毁账运动。该县二区五乡土地改革后，农民虽得地一千多亩，但契约和陈账仍为地主存藏不肯交出。旧历三月初一日，该乡在宋庄斗争大会上，农民一致要求地主宋百有交出，曾给宋家当过四十一年佃户的李生金说：“我在宋百有的祖爷爷手里还过的账，到现在多年了还不给我退约，这是穷人的穷根子，今天非拿出来不可。”当场群众喊出：“地主快把老约拿出来。”但宋百有犹图抵赖，群情激愤，从他家羊圈里搜出，拿到会场上主席当场念出陈账上的欠户名单，全场群众听了自己先辈人的名字，对地主的毒辣莫不愤恨，念毕，当即焚毁。
