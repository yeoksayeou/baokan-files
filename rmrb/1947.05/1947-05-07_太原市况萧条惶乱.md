Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 29th: The market in Taiyuan is depressed and filled with anxiety. According to statistics from the "Chamber of Commerce" run by the stubborn warlord Yan, over a hundred businesses closed down in February and March alone. Due to the implementation of the tyrannical "integration of soldiers and merchants" policy, the hiring price for each able-bodied man rose from 1,000 silver dollars in February to 3,000 dollars. To resist conscription, merchants universally hired shop assistants over fifty or under eighteen years of age. Due to skyrocketing prices, theft became rampant, and all the light bulbs on the streets and alleys were stolen, even in the bustling Liuxiang district. The stubborn Yan government had no choice but to stop providing streetlights, and the city's streets were pitch black at night.

　　太原市况萧条惶乱
    【新华社晋绥二十九日电】太原市况萧条，惶乱不安。据阎顽官办“商会”统计：二、三月份即有百余家商号倒闭。因“兵商合一”暴政施行，每个壮丁雇价由二月份千元银洋涨至三千元。商家为抵制抽丁，普遍雇用五十岁以上十八岁以下之店员，因物价狂涨，偷盗成风，大街小巷之电灯泡被偷一空，连热闹的柳巷铺亦然。阎顽政府只好不再配设路灯，入夜全城街道漆黑。
