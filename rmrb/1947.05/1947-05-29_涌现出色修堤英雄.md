　　Outstanding Dike-Building Heroes Emerge
    [Report from this newspaper in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region, 26th] Among the masses participating in dike construction in southern Hebei, many dike-building heroes have emerged. Zhao Dexing from the Fourth District of Shen County demonstrated remarkable achievements in the campaign to dig the Jinqian River. Bare-backed and barefoot, he pushed a small dirt cart weighing over 200 pounds all by himself. He pushed more than 400 cartloads of earth in one go, playing a significant role in motivating the entire team. During breaks, he said, "We came here to build dikes to defeat Chiang Kai-shek and protect the lives and property of the people in the Liberated Areas. It doesn't matter if we're a little tired; we must make contributions for the people." Shang Wenchen, from Nanchen Village in Shen County, is also a labor hero in digging the Jinqian River. Before coming, he prepared two large baskets, each capable of carrying 95 pounds. He carried 852 loads a day, totaling 4,260 loads in five days. One person's work exceeded that of four people. When others asked him, "Wenchen, are you tired?" he said, "Building dikes is to make contributions for the people; I am not tired." He has once again recorded the first merit in the merit book. Tang Qingnian from Wuxun Li Maotun, whose hair and beard are already white, made extraordinary contributions in this dike-building campaign. He carried two baskets of wet soil weighing 80 to 90 pounds each, while walking and saying, "Old Chiang is a coward; he wants to flood us. I don't want this old life anymore, I'll fight him. I can't fight on the front lines, but building dikes is fine." He carried more than a dozen loads in a row, and then competed with a young man in his twenties. During breaks, he picked up an iron shovel to shovel soil and level the piles, sharing his dike-building experience with everyone.

　　涌现出色修堤英雄
    【本报冀鲁豫二十六日电】冀南参加修堤群众中涌现出不少修堤英雄。莘县四区赵德兴在挖金钱河的立功运动中，表现了惊人的功绩。他光背赤脚，独推一辆二百多斤重的小土车。他一气推了四百余车土，在推动全班上起了很大作用。休息时他说：“咱们跑到这里来打堤，也是为了打出蒋二秃子，保卫解放区人民生命财产，累点不要紧，一定为人民立功。”尚文臣是莘县南沉庄人，他也是挖金钱河的劳动英雄，在临来时他就准备了两个大筐，一次能担重九十五斤，一天担八百五十二挑，五天中共挑四千二百六十挑，一人干的活超过四人，别人问他说：“文臣累的慌吗？”他说：“打堤是为人民立功我不累”。这次他又在功劳簿上记了第一功。武训李冒屯的唐清年，头发和胡须都已白了，在这次修堤立功中他立下了奇异的功劳，他担起两筐八、九十斤重的湿土，还边走边说：“老蒋个孬种，想淹咱，我这老命不要了，和他拼，上前线不中打堤可行啦。”他一连担十多担，又与一个二十多岁的小伙子竞赛，休息时他就拿起铁铣铲土平堆，给大家讲修堤的经验。
