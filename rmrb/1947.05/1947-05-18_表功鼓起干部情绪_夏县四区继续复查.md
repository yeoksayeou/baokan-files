　　Commending Merit Boosts Cadre Morale
    Fourth District of Xia County Continues Review
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 16th dispatch] The Fourth District of Xia County continues to implement reviews in lagging villages during the spring plowing. The review began on April 8th. Initially, it universally encountered resistance from cadres, making it difficult to deepen the work. The leadership then universally used commendation of merits to address shortcomings to encourage cadre morale, guiding cadres to overcome shortcomings and continue to serve the people. For example, when commending merits in Taikuan Village, some cadres recognized their shortcomings and vowed to make new achievements. After the cadres' thinking was clarified, the review progressed smoothly. They worked and deliberated in the fields during the day and discussed at night. As a result, three types of havens for feudal remnants were discovered: (1) Individual cadres provided protection. For example, Wang Tianyi of Wenyu Village was a feudal rich peasant, but the cadres insisted he was a well-to-do middle peasant and returned the land to him. (2) Unclear class designation. Guo Wuwei of Majiamiao relied solely on usury for a living but was classified as a rich peasant who started from labor, thus escaping struggle. (3) Landlords and local bullies exploited loopholes, either reducing the target by dividing up the family property, or using tenants from other villages for liquidation, provoking contradictions with tenants in this village, relaxing controls on both sides. After discovering these reasons, they quickly proceeded according to different situations. Currently, fourteen feudal landlord households, twenty feudal rich peasant households, one hundred and forty-two unliberated peasant households, and nine hundred and seventy-eight mu of undistributed land have been identified.

　　表功鼓起干部情绪
    夏县四区继续复查
    【本报太岳十六日电】夏县四区在春耕中对落后村继续贯彻复查。复查自四月八日开始，起初普遍遇到干部抵抗，工作很难深入，领导上便普遍以表功劳去缺点来鼓励干部情绪，引导干部克服缺点，继续为人民服务。如太宽村有些干部在表功劳时，认识了自己缺点，宣誓以后要重新立功，干部思想打通后，复查便获得顺利进展，白天在地里做活酝酿，黑夜讨论，结果查出封建尾巴的三种避难所，（一）个别干部包庇，如温峪村王天义是个封建富农，干部却硬说他是富裕中农，把土地退回给他。（二）划分成份不明确，马家庙郭伍威专靠高利贷生活，却被划为劳动起家富农，逃避斗争。（三）地主恶霸钻空子，或以分家缩小目标，或利用外村佃户来清算，挑拨与本村佃户矛盾，两头放松。查出这些原因后，即按不同情况迅速进行，现已查出封建地主十四户，封建富农二十户，未翻身农民一百四十二户，未分土地九百七十八亩。
