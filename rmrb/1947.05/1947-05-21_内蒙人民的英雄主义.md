The heroism of the People of Inner Mongolia

After the Chiang-Fu troops occupied Zhangjiakou, the vast grasslands beyond the Great Wall, the Chahar and Xilin Gol Leagues, were no longer peaceful. The Greater Han chauvinist Chiang Kai-shek and Fu (Zuoyi) bandit gang, the Mongol traitor landlord Li Zitang, Hu Jiujiang and other bandits, and feudal ruling princes, all invaded the grasslands, seizing land and sheep. The heroic Mongolian youths mounted their steeds, took up their guns, and joined the People's Liberation Army. They organized militia guerrilla teams, everywhere striking at the rapacious bandits of the "conquerors." Along with the great sandstorms of winter, gunfire echoed across the grasslands, everywhere spreading the heroic stories of the people of Inner Mongolia.

The Uertu Bing Seng Cavalry Team

The heroic stories of the Uertu Bing Seng militia self-defense force in resisting the Chiang-Fu troops are spreading across the grasslands like a song. In October, Uertu Bing Seng of the Zhenglan Banner in Chahar League, with his fiery patriotism and superb marksmanship, was elected by the youths as the militia captain, forming a guerrilla team of more than twenty people. In mid-November, a gang of more than two hundred bandits from Duolun was preparing to plunder the rich Endom Temple area. Uertu Bing Seng led the militia in patrolling the snowy ground and the sand dunes in front of the temple in the middle of the night. At dawn, the bandit cavalry galloped over like a black ribbon. The gun barrels behind the sand dunes flickered with sparks, and suddenly opened fire all at once. The bandit cavalry was caught off guard, and for a time, people screamed and horses neighed, dragging the dead and wounded as they fled like a disturbed swarm of bees.

More than half a month later, the Fu bandits launched another large-scale looting operation. One day, as the sun was about to set, the Fu bandits were driving more than fifty horses loaded with furs and valuables back to their lair when the unpredictable Uertu Bing Seng militia suddenly came galloping from dozens of miles away like a whirlwind. They quickly seized the sand ridges on both sides of the caravan and opened fire. The bandits tried several times to desperately charge up the mountain on horseback, but were resolutely repelled by the militia. Finally, taking advantage of the fact that the militia's rifles on the sand ridges were frozen and could not fire, the Fu bandits abandoned their property and horses, and fled like wild beasts.

The Fu bandits were determined to annihilate the Uertu Bing Seng militia. Their mounted scouts reconnoitered for a long time, and taking advantage of the fact that Uertu Bing Seng's men were resting in the Lama Temple in Xibaimiao, they rushed to surround them overnight. The militia received intelligence from the Mongolian people in advance and fled to the boundless grasslands. In a series of battles, the Uertu Bing Seng cavalry team has now grown several times in strength, becoming an iron cavalry protecting the homeland and loving the country on the grasslands.

The brave old woman, Alenna

Last winter, in the Alenna area of Ming'an Banner in Chahar League, the Inner Mongolian People's Liberation Army defeated the stubborn bandit Li Zitang. Inner Mongolian soldier La Xilie Ma was wounded and lost from his unit. An old woman, Alenna, and her daughter-in-law carried La Xilie Ma into their yurt. The Fu bandits came to search the yurt several times. The first time they asked the old woman, "Is anyone here?" The old woman replied, "My son is sick in bed." The second time the Fu bandits asked her daughter-in-law, "Who is in bed?" The daughter-in-law bravely admitted that it was her husband. Later, when the company commander came to pick up soldier La Xilie Ma, the old woman carefully checked the shoulder straps, asked for the unit number, and checked the accent before letting La Xilie Ma go with him. Another time, the deputy company commander of the Third Company led three soldiers and four horses to Habaga to shoe horses. As the people were warmly receiving them, the enemy entered Habacheng. When the enemy surrounded them, they jumped into the cellar with the help of the people, transferred to other houses, and safely rushed out from the place where there were fewer enemies.

The thirteen heroes of Haibierjia

On the night of January 5, the Fu bandit Wang Shengwu's cavalry unit invaded the Heishamian area of Zhengbai Banner in Chahar League, and surrounded the Dongjiayingzi in Ningdemiqinggou. Guan Qiyi, the elected League leader of Chahar League, was leading three cadres and guards in the village, carrying out work. Before they could transfer, they resisted heroically. The Fu bandits charged into the courtyard several times, but were repelled, and their platoon leader and others were killed or wounded. Finally, the enemy set fire to the house, forcing them to surrender. League leader Guan and others were unmoved, and died together after running out of ammunition. Another bandit cavalry unit surrounded Haibierjia, a nearby trading town. Fu Zihong, the leader of the Chahar League Armed Work Team, and Zhang Yongshou, the company commander of a certain division of the Inner Mongolia People's Self-Defense Army who went to the area to shoe horses, and soldiers Xian Gui, Yong Liang, and others, resisted for six or seven hours. The Fu bandits forced old women and children to persuade them to surrender, but they were sternly refused. The ten heroes took advantage of the dim cloud color to launch a brave assault. Only one member of the armed work team, Yu Yueshi, was killed by a stray bullet in Yueshi Mountain. The Fu bandits suffered 40 to 50 casualties. The heroic story of the thirteen heroes of Haibierjia spread throughout the grasslands. Lamas piously held a cremation ceremony for the four martyrs including League Leader Guan. They said: This is a brilliant manifestation of the heroic tradition of Genghis Khan.

　　内蒙人民的英雄主义
    蒋傅军侵占张家口后，广漠的塞外草原上，察哈尔盟和锡林郭勤盟，没有了平静。大汉族主义者蒋傅（作义）匪帮蒙奸地主李子堂、胡九江等股匪，封建王公统治者，一齐侵入了草原，夺去了土地和羊群。英雄的蒙古青年们，他们跨上了骏马，拿起了枪投奔人民解放军，他们组织了民兵游击队，到处打击着那些“征服者”匪帮的奸淫杀掠，随着冬季的大飞沙，草原上到处响起了枪声，到处传播着内蒙人民的英雄故事。
    乌而图邴僧骑兵队
    乌而图邴僧民兵自卫队，抗击蒋傅军的英雄故事，像一支歌似的在草原上传布着。云秋十月间，察盟正蓝旗老乌而图邴僧以他火热的保乡爱国心和神绝的枪法，被青年们选举为民兵队长。组成一支二十多人的游击队。十一月中旬，多伦一股土匪二百多人马准备大肆洗劫富庶的恩多木庙地区，乌而图邴僧率领民兵们半夜起来在雪地上，在庙前的沙丘上巡逻着。薄明时，匪骑像条黑带似的＠逦驰来，沙丘后的十几条枪筒闪烁着火星，突然一齐射击。匪骑来不及防，一时人喊马嘶，拖着死伤者像一窝乱蜂逃去了。
    又过了半个多月，傅匪又大举出动抢掠。这天日头快偏西了，傅匪正驱赶着抢来的五十多匹满载皮毛财物的骏马回窜时，不意神鬼莫测的乌而图邴僧民兵队，又像一阵旋风似的从数十里外飞奔来了。迅速抢占了骆辞两侧的沙岗，开火射击，匪徒几次拚命策马向山上冲杀，都被民兵们沉着击退。最后乘沙岗上民兵的快枪冻住打不响，傅匪才弃下财物马匹，像野兽般的溃去。
    傅匪决心歼灭乌而图邴僧的民兵队，他的骑哨侦察很久，乘老乌而图邴僧的人驻在西白庙的喇嘛寺中休整，连夜赶去包围。民兵们事先获得蒙民的情报，驰向了茫无边际的草原。在一连串的战斗中，老乌而图邴僧骑兵队现在已经壮大数倍，成为草原上一支保乡爱国的铁骑。
    勇敢的阿伦那老太太
    去年冬天，在察盟明安旗阿伦那地方，内蒙人民子弟兵击溃了顽匪李子堂，内蒙战士拉希列马负伤掉队了。阿伦那一个老太太和她的媳妇，把拉希列马背入自己的蒙古包。傅匪好几次来搜查这个蒙古包，第一回问了老太太：“有没有人？”老太太回答：“我的儿子病了在床上。”第二回傅匪问了她媳妇：“床上是谁？”媳妇勇敢地承认了是自己的丈夫。后来连长去接战士拉希列马，老太太细心地对了肩章，又问了番号，查了口音，才放心让拉希列马跟他去了。又一次，三连连副带领了三个战士、四匹马进入哈巴戛去挂掌，当老百姓正亲热地接待他们时，敌人进入了哈巴城。当敌人向他们包围时，他们在老百姓帮助下跳进地窑，转到别的屋子，从敌人少的地方安全的冲出去了。
    海别而加的十三勇士
    一月五日夜，源傅匪王胜武部骑兵犯察盟正白旗黑沙面一带，包围了凝的密青沟东家营子。察盟民选盟长关起义，正率干部卫士三人在村中进行工作着，未及转移，即英勇抗击。傅匪数度冲入院中，均被击退，毙伤其排长等多人。最后敌人纵火烧房，迫其出降。关盟长等毫无所动，于弹尽后一同殉难。另部匪骑包围了附近贸易重镇海别而加，察盟武工队分队长傅子洪及前往该地钉掌的内蒙人民自卫军某师连长张永寿、战士显贵、永良等十人，抗击达六七小时之久。傅匪曾强迫老妪、儿童前往劝降均遭严词拒绝。十勇士乘云色朦胧勇猛冲击，其中仅一武工队员于越士山时中流弹牺牲。傅匪伤亡达四五十名。海别而加十三勇士的英勇故事传遍了草原，喇嘛们虔诚的为关盟长等四烈士举行了火葬。他们说：这是成吉思汗英雄传统的光辉表现。
