　　Breaking Through One Village to Drive a Whole Area
  　Fushan New District Vigorously Carries Out Land Distribution
    [Report from Taiyue, this newspaper, 29th] After the breakthrough at the central village in the newly recovered area of Fushan, the land reform has been fully launched. Zhongcun is a village five miles from the suburbs of Fushan. Last year, a mass movement was once carried out, but later the city of Fushan was occupied by the Chiang army, and the village was severely devastated by reactionary forces. Therefore, the masses were initially timid and dared not act, fearing retaliation from the reactionaries, and the cadres did not dare to lead. They all said to the work team comrades: "It's almost done, it was all struggled last year, everyone doesn't have much suffering or feudalism." The district cadres knew that the masses had been frightened by the reactionary landlords and dared not move, so they dispersed and went deep into the families to inquire about the concerns of the masses. On the 15th of this month, a village-wide meeting was held to publicize the news of our army's victory and the policy of land to the tiller. More than a hundred people attended, gradually changing from suspicion and silence to gently nodding in agreement. Seeing that the masses' minds had changed, the district cadres used the method of eating and chatting that night to collect the masses' reactions. Middle peasant Chen Maoyu said, "If we are given our original land back, we still want it." Pseudo-official Quan Cheng said, "If we had known about such a good policy, we wouldn't have let our people leave." The general poor peasants said very firmly, "The doubts of the past were all self-imposed fears. When the Central Army comes, we will also eliminate them." Grasping this opportunity, the district cadres launched an intensified brewing process, and on the third day, they convened a grievance meeting. At the beginning, the village cadres first announced that they would do their best to help the masses win back their land, and the masses first began to complain about the suffering of their individual families, then about the suffering of the Chiang and Yan armies. Finally, they concentrated their attack on the landlords and local bullies, believing that without the landlords and local bullies, Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan would lose their eyes and ears and claws and teeth. Li Tiaoshan's daughter-in-law cried loudly, "My child was just learning to walk when he was killed by Chiang Kai-shek's army with a knife." The massacre of Li Tiaoshan's child was a tragic case that the masses of the whole village could not bear to witness, so when she mentioned it, the old and young in the audience shed tears of sympathy, and some even left the meeting crying uncontrollably. In this way, one suffering led to another, and countless sufferings were poured out, and then gradually entered the solution of the land problem. After the breakthrough in the village, the masses in nearby Xinhe Village and other places were also successively involved in the struggle.

　　突破一村推动一片
  　浮山新区大力开展分田
    【本报太岳二十九日电】浮山新收复区突破中村基点后，土地改革已全面开展。中村是浮山城郊五里的一个村庄，去年曾一度进行群众运动，后来浮山城被蒋军侵占，该村即遭反动势力的严重摧残，因此，群众最初畏缩不敢行动，怕反动派回来报复，干部也不敢领导，他们都向工作队同志说：“差不多了，去年都斗争过了，大家都没甚苦、没甚封建了。”区干部知道群众已被反动地主吓得不敢动弹，便分散深入家庭，探询群众的心事。本月十五日又开了全村大会，宣传我军胜利消息和耕者有其田政策，到会百余人渐由疑惧沉默而至轻轻点头示意。区干部见群众心机已变，当天晚上就以吃饭闲谈方法搜集群众的反映。中农陈茂煜说：“要给咱原地咱还要”，伪属权成与说：“早知道这样好的政策就不叫咱的人走了”。一般贫农皆很坚决的说：“已往那些疑虑都是自己吓唬自己，中央军来了，咱也要消灭了他。”区干部抓住这个火候，发动加紧酝酿，便在第三天召开诉苦大会。开始村干部先宣布要以全力帮助群众争回土地，群众亦先从个人家庭之苦诉起，再诉到蒋阎军的苦，最后便将锋芒集中到地主、恶霸头上，认为没有地主、恶霸，蒋介石、阎锡山就失掉了耳目爪牙，李佻山媳妇大声哭着说：“我的娃养到刚会走路，就被蒋介石的军队一刀杀死了”，屠杀李佻山娃是全村群众目不忍睹的一件惨案，所以当她提起来时，全场老小都掉下同情之泪，有的竟难以抑制的离开会场大哭起来。如此以苦引苦接二连三无数的苦，都诉开了，于是逐步进入解决土问题。该村突破后，影响了附近的南西河新村等地群众亦先后卷入斗争。
