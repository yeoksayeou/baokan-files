　　【Report from Jinnan, 18th】 More than 300 students of the First Battalion of the Chiang Army Officer Training Regiment, liberated by our army, are about to graduate after more than four months of study. They all expressed their willingness to participate in work in the liberated areas or to study at the Military and Political University, to atone for their crimes and make contributions to the people. In early April, under the slogan of "Pouring out grievances, speaking out disasters, remembering hatred, remembering sorrow," they exposed the dark crimes of the Chiang-controlled areas and carried out "root tracing" to further recognize that the rule of the four major families is the root cause of all evils. In early May, due to the improvement of their understanding, some people began to confess their various crimes and concealed problems in the Chiang army, and the confession movement was launched immediately. They unanimously saw clearly: "If we don't cut off these tails and put down the burden, we can't serve the people wholeheartedly." More than 300 people are all rejoicing for having gained a new life.

　　【Report from Taihang, 19th】 Recently, 55 officers from the Taihang Chiang Army Officer Training Regiment, after settling past history and recognizing the bright future of serving the people, requested to participate in work. The People's Liberation Army accepted their request with a welcome attitude, and they have now embarked on new jobs. Before leaving, the regiment held a farewell meeting. The officers who participated in the work and the officers who continued to study encouraged each other. Guo Zhenji, the former battalion commander of the First Battalion of the 3rd Regiment of the 39th Division, said: "In the past ten years, we have gained nothing except blindly acting as a tool to rule the people. When we arrived in the liberated area, the people did not blame the past and gave us the opportunity to study. Today, we can embark on a job to serve the people, which is really fortunate. I hope that all of you who are still studying will quickly open your eyes and wash the mud off your bodies in this clear pond!" (Liu Baorong)

　　【Report from the northern Henan front, 19th】 A unit of the Chiang Kai-shek puppet army security team stationed north of Anling, consisting of more than 50 people, led by Battalion Commander Niu Yiguan and Company Commander Liu Yuwen, automatically surrendered to the People's Liberation Army at 4:30 p.m. on the 10th, carrying three light machine guns and more than 40 rifles.

　　冀南太行解放军官三百余人参加我军
    安阳蒋伪一部携械投诚
    【本报冀南十八日电】被我解放之蒋军军官教导团一大队，学员三百余人经过四个多月的学习，即将毕业，彼等均表示愿参加解放区工作或到军大学习，为人民戴罪立功。四月初他们在“倒出苦水、诉出灾难、记住仇恨、记住悲痛”的口号下，暴露蒋管区的黑暗罪恶，进行“追根”，进一步认清了四大家族的统治是一切罪恶的总根源。五月上旬，他们由于觉悟的提高，开始有人坦白自己在蒋军中的种种罪恶和隐瞒的问题，坦白运动遂即开展。他们一致看清：“不割掉这些尾巴，放下包袱，就不能安心忠诚为人民服务”。三百余人均为自己获得新生命而庆幸。
    【本报太行十九日电】太行蒋军军官教导团最近有五十五位军官在清算过去历史与认识为人民服务的光明前途以后，要求参加工作，人民解放军以欢迎的态度，接受了他们的请求，现彼等已走上新的工作岗位。临行前，该团曾举行欢送大会，参加工作的军官与继续学习的军官互相勉励，原三九师三团一营和校营长郭振纪说：“我们过去十余年的奔波，除了盲目地作了统治人民的工具以外，毫无所得。到了解放区，人民不咎既往，给我们以学习机会，今天又能走上为人民服务的工作岗位，实为万幸。希望尚在学习中的诸位，赶快擦亮眼睛，在这个清塘里洗净自己身上的污泥！”  （刘宝荣）
    【本报豫北前线十九日电】驻安陵北清除蒋伪军保安队一部五十余人，于十日下午四时半，在大队长牛一冠、中队长刘郁文率领下，自动向人民解放军投诚，携轻机枪三挺，步枪四十余支。
