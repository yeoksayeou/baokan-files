　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th: According to an Associated Press dispatch from Shanghai on the 26th, the Democratic League recently issued a written statement condemning Chiang Kai-shek's "reorganized" "government" as not being a government intending to achieve democracy in China. The statement said, "Economically, the Chinese people have already been impoverished to the point of waiting for death in misery, but the new government continues to conscript soldiers, extort money, and collect illegal donations and taxes, which are leading the country to collapse." The statement "opposes any loans to China; because if the civil war continues, these loans will only be used directly or indirectly to slaughter our own compatriots." The statement also called on Chiang Kai-shek to stop the civil war and cooperate peacefully with the Chinese Communist Party.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th: The government reorganized by Chiang Kai-shek has already used $500 million in loans granted to China by the United States. The U.S. government has allowed the Chiang government to use a portion of this loan in advance, on the condition that the Chiang government submit the plan for the use of the funds to Washington for approval. The Chiang government is also conducting negotiations with the United States for another loan, the amount of which is $650 million to $1 billion. According to a report in the Ta Kung Pao, the new Premier Zhang Qun, when answering reporters, said: The new loan currently under negotiation will soon be granted by the United States.

    民主同盟发表书面声明
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】据美联社上海二十六日电：民主同盟顷发出书面声明，谴责蒋介石“改组”的“政府”不是一个打算在中国实现民主的政府。声明称：“在经济上中国人民已经贫困到等死的悲惨地步，但新政府仍继续征兵勒索与征收非法捐税，这些正使国家走向崩溃。”声明“反对任何对华贷款；因为内战一旦继续下去，这些贷款只是直接或间接地用来屠杀我们自己的同胞。”声明并要求蒋介石停止内战，与中共和平合作。
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】蒋介石改组后的政府已使用美国给予中国的五万万元借款。美国政府已允许蒋政府先行使用此项贷款的一部，条件是蒋政府必须把该款使用方案送华盛顿批准。蒋政府并正与美国进行另一借款之商谈，其数目为六万五千万至十万万美元。据大公报报导，新任行政院长张群于回答记者时称：正在商洽中之新借款，短期便会被美国应允的。
