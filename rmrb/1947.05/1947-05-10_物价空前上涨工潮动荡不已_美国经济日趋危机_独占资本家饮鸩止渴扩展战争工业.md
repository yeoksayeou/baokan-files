　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th: A comprehensive report: The American economic situation is deteriorating daily, with unprecedented price increases and constant labor unrest, while also resorting to desperate measures to create a false sense of prosperity. According to a recent announcement by the U.S. Department of Labor: from February 15th to March 10th, most essential commodities in the United States have seen unprecedented price increases, pushing the consumer price index to as high as 156.3. In the week from April 19th to April 26th, the wholesale prices of 900 commodities were 34% higher than the prices of the same commodities during the same period last year. Meanwhile, the nationwide general strike of 300,000 telephone workers, which began in early April, continues to persist. 90,000 members of five branches of the National Federation of Telephone Workers are firmly continuing their strike. Although the leaders of four independent telephone worker unions in New York once compromised with the employers and signed a contract for a four-dollar weekly wage increase, it was widely opposed by the members of those unions and failed to pass. The majority of operators refused to return to work. On the other hand, American monopoly capitalists are trying their best to avoid the arrival of the economic crisis by manipulating monopolies and strengthening military industries, etc. Superficially, the major companies of American monopoly capitalists seem to have made great profits in the first quarter of this year. For example, the United States Steel Corporation has earned profits of over $39 million, a fourfold increase compared to the $10 million in the same period last year. But this is just like their use of expansion policies to temporarily stimulate the increase in exports, creating a total U.S. export value of $1,327,000,000 in March, it is merely another symptom of economic deterioration, a so-called false prosperity. At the same time, monopoly capitalists are also resorting to desperate measures, expanding war industries, and further pursuing this false prosperity. According to TASS: A New York Times reporter reported that the U.S. Army and Navy Munitions Board is about to complete the so-called "Industrial Mobilization Plan." The plan stipulates an investment of $200 billion in the United States' lacking combat materials over a five-year period. Obviously, the result of this approach can only further accelerate the arrival of the economic crisis of American imperialism.

　　物价空前上涨工潮动荡不已
    美国经济日趋危机
    独占资本家饮鸩止渴扩展战争工业
    【新华社陕北六日电】综合报导：美国经济情势日益恶化，物价空前上涨，工潮动荡不已而又饮鸩止渴，制造假象景气。据美国劳工部近日宣称；自二月十五日至三月十日间，美国大部生活必需品皆空前上涨，使消费品之价格指数高达一百五十六点三；自四月十九日至二十六日为止之一周中，有九百种商品之批发价格较去年同一时期中之商品价格高出百分之三十四。同时，自四月初开始的三十万电话工人全国性总罢工，迄今仍在坚持中。全国电话工人同盟的五个分会九万人坚决地继续罢工。四个纽约独立的电话工人工会的领袖，虽曾一度与资方妥协，签订了一个每星期增加四元工资的合同，但被各该工会的会员普遍反对，而未能通过，大部分接线生拒绝了复工。另一方面，美国独占资本家们竭力想以操纵垄断和加强军事工业等办法来逃避经济危机的降临，从表面上看，美国独占资本家们的各大公司，本年第一季似乎获得了很大的利润，例如美国炼钢联合公司获得了将超过三千九百万美元的利润，较去年同时期内之一千万美元增加了四倍。但这正如同他们利用扩张政策暂时刺激了出口的增加，造成了三月份美国出口总值一、三二七、○○○、○○○美元一样，只不过是经济恶化的另一种症候，所谓假象景气而已。同时，独占资本家们还要饮鸩止渴，以扩展战争工业，更进一步去追逐这种假象景气。据塔斯社讯：纽约时报记者报导：美国陆海军军火局即将完成所谓“工业动员计划”。该计划中规定在五年期间以二十万万美元投资于美国所缺少的作战物资。显然的，这种干法的结果，只能更加速美帝国主义经济危机的降临。
