Rear Area Military and Civilians Donate Large Quantities of Gifts to Comfort the Brave Soldiers at the Front

[Our Newspaper] Comrade Zhao Zhangwen and others from the Supply Department of the Military Region spontaneously initiated a movement to comfort the front lines, which has been enthusiastically launched. Comrade Zhao donated shoes, towels, and other items worth over thirty yuan. Director Yu took 2,000 yuan in cash, stocks worth 10,000 yuan, and a tube of toothpaste. Female family members are also meticulously crafting comfort bags, finding people to write comfort letters, and buying cigarettes and soap, preparing to fill the comfort bags to the brim. Zheng, a 67-year-old woman, generously took out two silver dollars she had saved for more than ten years to comfort the soldiers at the front. Comrade Jiang Meng donated all of his hard-earned savings of 20,000 yuan from years of production, plus two silver dollars. Breeder Liu Qinxiang, fearing he would fall behind, quickly ran to the instructor and said, "Although my family is very poor, my grandfather left behind a 50-tael silver ingot and some broken silver when he ran a restaurant. I am willing to donate them."

The movement is still going on enthusiastically. According to temporary statistics for five days, cash, stocks, towels, milk, shoes, socks, soap, toothbrushes, etc., worth a total of 162,000 yuan have been donated, as well as 18 comfort bags and 21 comfort letters. The first batch has been sent to the Political Department for forwarding to the front.

After paying their respects to Generals Liu Bocheng and Deng Xiaoping, they carried over a thousand comfort letters and a large number of comfort items from the Border Government and Border Assembly. Today, they set off to the battlefield to comfort the troops.

[Our Newspaper, Yubei Front, 19th] The comfort delegations from various counties in the Taihang District brought a large number of comfort items and letters to comfort the officers and soldiers of the 1213th unit of the People's Liberation Army on the 7th. The comfort delegation told the soldiers about the rear area people's active production and support for the front lines. The soldiers deeply felt the people's concern for them and expressed their determination to perform meritorious service in the future. Zhao Dongcun, the platoon leader of the machine gun company of a certain unit, received a letter from his mother brought by the comfort delegation, as well as a photo of the whole village holding a celebration meeting and hanging a "Merit Plaque" at his home. He was extremely excited and determined to perform another great service in the next battle.
