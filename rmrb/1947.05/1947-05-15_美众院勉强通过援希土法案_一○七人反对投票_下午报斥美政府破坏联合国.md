Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, May 13th: TASS Washington, May 10th: The House of Representatives recently passed Truman’s “aid” to Turkey and Greece bill by a vote of 287 to 107. Thousands of letters sent to Congress, various public opinion polls, and other indications all prove that Truman's unilateral interventionism does not have the support of the people. Most opinions regarding the bill express unease and fear, and consider it a blow to the United Nations. This popular reaction first explains why there was a large number of opposing votes in the House of Representatives, and also explains why the passage in Congress was delayed for so long, even though Truman requested in his message to Congress on March 12 that the bill be passed before April 1. Even with the intensive propaganda campaign by the vast majority of newspapers and radio stations, the government still could not win popular support for the bill. Some conservative journalists, including Reston of the New York Times, recently said that most congressmen would only vote in favor of the bill reluctantly and with great suspicion. Many congressmen argued strongly with those who strongly urged the passage of the bill, protesting the rapid vote. Representative Marcantonio of the New York Labor Party stated that the House's action constituted a "mockery of the House rules." Marcantonio also stated that the bill helps fascists all over the world. He pointed out that the Greek problem is not a communist problem, but a problem of bread, land, and fair taxation. We are giving money to the Greek fascist regime to kill Greek guerrillas—some of whom are communists, but some are not—we are giving money to Nazi-fascist collaborators to buy guns. Finally, Mr. Ma warned the House of Representatives that they are making a mistake by approving this bill; and that supporting this bill weakens the United Nations. Illinois Republican Representative Busby condemned the bill as a "trick to instigate a declaration of war." Busby said that if this bill is approved, it will reorganize the army and return to reaction. New York Republican Representative Reed opposed the bill, saying, "Stopping communism is just a smokescreen." He went on to say that the bill attempts to increase the wealth of a few exporters who want to sell goods abroad. Michigan Democratic Representative Sadowski also vehemently criticized the bill.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, May 13th: TASS New York, May 10th: The Afternoon Paper published an article titled "Appealing to Reason," advocating that the House of Representatives unconditionally reject the US government's unilateral interventionism. The paper stated that encouraging interference in the internal affairs of other countries would arouse hatred of the United States around the world, undermine peace, and destroy the United Nations organization; the Truman government has not paid attention to these issues. The Afternoon Paper accused Truman of distorting the Greek situation and stated that the solution to the Greek situation should rely on the actions of the United Nations, not on the unilateral interference of the United States. Truman's military aid plan to Turkey is full of serious dangers, and the Dardanelles problem will not be solved either. The paper concluded that not a single American truly voted to express support for Truman's plan to aid Turkey and Greece. All the letters to Congress expressed opposition. The Afternoon Paper also carried an article by former UNRRA Director LaGuardia urging the rejection of the Turkey and Greece plan, saying it was a unilateral plan that defrauded the United Nations.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, May 13th: TASS News: Famous Canadian radio commentator Philpot, recently published a commentary in the "Citizen Daily" on the situation of American interference in the internal affairs of Turkey and Greece, pointing out that the conspiracy of this policy is completely obvious and will lead to the greatest disaster in modern history. However, no matter how the American and British imperialists and the Greek reactionaries collude, the Greek people who are advancing along the path of democracy cannot be stopped.

　　美众院勉强通过援希土法案
    一○七人反对投票     
    下午报斥美政府破坏联合国
    【新华社陕北十三日电】塔斯社华盛顿十日电：众议院顷以二百八十七票对一百零七票通过了杜鲁门的“援助”土希法案。数千封送达国会的信件，各种民意测验和别的迹象，都证明了杜鲁门的片面干涉主义得不到人民的拥护。对于该法案大多数意见都表示不安与恐惧，并认为是对联合国的打击。这种人民的反应首先就说明了为什么众议院中有大量的反对票，也说明了为什么虽然杜鲁门在三月十二日致国会的咨文中请求在四月一日以前通过这法案，而国会中的通过还是迟滞了很久。纵然极大多数报纸和广播进行了紧张的宣传运动，政府仍然不能赢得人民赞成这个法案。若干保守的新闻记者包括纽约时报的记者莱斯敦在内，最近说，大多数议员仅会以勉强和极大的怀疑来投票赞成这个法案。许多议员坚决地和那些极力催促通过此法案的议员进行辩论，抗议急速举行投票。纽约劳工党议员马楚东纽称：众议院的行动形成了“对众议院法规的嘲讽”。马楚东纽又称：这法案帮助全世界的法西斯分子。并指出：希腊问题并不是共产党问题，而是面包，土地与公平抽税的问题。我们是给钱与希腊法西斯政权去打死希腊游击队——他们有的是共产党员，有的却不是——我们是拿钱给纳粹法西斯合作者买枪。最后马氏警告众议院称：他们由于批准这一法案，正在造成错误；并且支持这一法案就是削弱联合国。伊利诺斯州共和党议员巴士比谴责这法案是“促成宣战的诡计”。巴士比说假若这法案被批准了，就会重组军队和回到反动去。纽约共和党议员芮德反对这法案说：“阻止共产主义只是烟幕”，他接着说这法案企图为少数想在国外售货的出口商增殖财产。密芝安州民主党议员莎杜尔斯亦猛烈抨击这个法案。
    【新华社陕北十三日电】塔斯社纽约十日电：下午报以“诉诸理智”为题著文，主张众议院无条件驳斥美国政府所行的片面干涉主义。该报称：鼓励干涉他国内政，会激起全世界对美国的仇恨、破坏和平和摧毁联合国机构；杜鲁门政府并未注意到这些问题。下午报复责杜鲁门歪曲了希腊局势。并称：希腊局势的解决要依靠联合国的行动，不能依靠美国的片面干涉。杜鲁门军事援土方案充满了严重的危险，使达达尼尔问题也不会解决。该报结论称：美国人民没有一个人真正投票表示赞成杜鲁门援助土希的计划。所有给国会的信都表示反对。下午报又载前联总署长拉瓜第亚敦促拒绝土希方案的论文，说它是欺诈联合国的片面计划。
    【新华社陕北十三日电】塔斯社讯：著名加拿大广播评论员非尔波特，顷就美国干涉希土内政之情形在《公民日报》上发表评论指出：此种政策之阴谋是完全明显的，他将招致现代史上最大之灾祸。然而，不管美英帝国主义者与希腊反动派如何勾结，那些循着民主道路迈进的希腊人民，是不能被阻止的。
