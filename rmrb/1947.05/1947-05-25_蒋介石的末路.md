Xinhua News Agency Commentary:

　　May is such an unlucky month for Chiang Kai-shek! Chiang Kai-shek has encountered a serious crisis on the military front of attacking the liberated areas, and has also encountered a serious crisis on the economic and political fronts of oppressing and exploiting the people. The food crisis and "rice riots" that have arisen in various places since the beginning of May due to soaring grain prices have just begun, and the student movements in Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Pingjin, Qingdao, Zhejiang, Jiangxi and other places, centered on the slogans of anti-civil war, anti-hunger, and saving the education crisis, have reached a new climax; its magnificence, as Chiang Kai-shek himself said: "unprecedented in any previous period." To this end, the Chiang government specially announced the so-called "Temporary Measures for Maintaining Social Order" on the 18th, ordering local authorities to take "emergency measures and effective prevention" for all "overstepping" or petitioning of more than ten people, as well as strikes, work stoppages, business stoppages, demonstrations, or other "disturbances to public safety and current affairs." At the same time, Chiang Kai-shek, Zhang Qun, Zhu Jiahua, and others all made speeches, greatly engaging in slander and intimidation. Chiang Kai-shek's speech was particularly vicious, saying that if students "hinder the interests of the public (the two characters should be read as Chiang Kai-shek) and the freedom of others (the two characters should be read as Chiang Kai-shek), then their freedom will not be protected by the law but should be subject to the sanctions of the law." Because, "What good is it for the state to have such schools, and why pity such unruly and violent youth. In order to protect the life of the entire country (four characters should be read as Chiang Kai-shek) and the future of all young people (four characters should be read as Chiang Kai-shek), we will have to take decisive measures." However, the youth who are fighting for survival have not flinched in the slightest. On the 19th, after students from various schools in Shanghai saw off their representatives to Nanjing to petition, they held a large-scale parade. On the 20th, students from various schools in Nanjing and student representatives from Shanghai, Hangzhou and other places held a "Joint Parade of Sixteen Colleges and Universities in the Nanjing-Shanghai-Suzhou-Hangzhou Area to Save the Education Crisis." On the same day, students from various schools in Peiping and Tianjin also made parades and street speeches. Students in Wuhan, Qingdao and other places have gone on strike in response. Although Chiang Kai-shek's military police and secret agents have injured and arrested dozens of students in Peiping and Nanjing, similar atrocities will continue to occur, but the just struggle of the youth and people of the whole country will never be overwhelmed by any such "decisive measures," this can be asserted.
    Chiang Kai-shek said that this student movement was "unprecedented in any previous period," and he is indeed telling an important truth here. The most prominent features of this student movement are: first, its breadth. For example, the Zhejiang Ying Shi University and Jiangxi Zhongzheng University, named after Chiang Kai-shek's mentor Chen Ying Shi and Chiang Kai-shek himself respectively, had not participated in student movements in the past, but this time they stood at the forefront of the struggle. Even the members of the "Central Training Corps" general class of Chiang Kai-shek's Party School put forward six demands regarding their lives in this upsurge of the student movement. This is "unprecedented in any previous period." The second is courage. Chiang Kai-shek does not allow students to strike, but the students expand the strike; Chiang Kai-shek does not allow students to demonstrate, but the students expand the demonstration; Chiang Kai-shek does not allow students to take cars, but the students drive their own cars; Chiang Kai-shek orders military police and secret agents to beat students, but the students snatch the water cannons from their hands and break through their encirclement. Everything that Chiang Kai-shek deliberately pretends to be solemn and sacred has been discarded by the masses like dog shit. This is also "unprecedented in any previous period" in Chiang Kai-shek's ruling record. Where do these two characteristics come from? The movement is widespread because it starts from the most pressing needs of the masses - to eat and to have peace. No one doesn't want to eat, but Chiang Kai-shek's rule today makes it impossible for most Chinese people (including most college students and university professors) to have food; the reason why the people have no food is because Chiang Kai-shek launched a national civil war and destroyed the peace movement that the people of the whole country are striving for. Courage is due to the universalization of the people's struggle (not only is there the struggle of students across the country, but also the struggle of teachers, workers, civil servants, citizens and farmers across the country, especially the great self-defense war of hundreds of millions of people in the liberated areas), and because the crisis of Chiang Kai-shek's rule is becoming apparent. In modern Chinese history, only three mass movements can be compared with today, namely the May Fourth Movement in 1919, the May 30th Movement in 1925, and the December 9th Movement in 1935. But none of the masses in these three movements put forward such tragic and universal slogans against hunger as they do today, nor did they openly see that the people have such powerful strength, and openly see that the reactionary rulers are so tottering. This is the real reason why the scale and spirit of this mass movement are "unprecedented in any previous period."
    In the face of any great mass movement (no matter how just this movement is, and how glorious and sacred it is in later historical records), has any reactionary ruling group ever yielded? Has any reactionary ruling group not greatly engaged in slander and intimidation against the masses? Chiang Kai-shek's announcement of the so-called "Temporary Measures for Maintaining Order" nakedly exposes that the fascist nature of his so-called "liberal government" is a manifestation of the madness of the Chiang Kai-shek fascist group, and at the same time a manifestation of its dying and extremely weak state. The fascist methods adopted by the Chiang Kai-shek group against today's student movement and other mass movements are, on the one hand, vicious, but on the other hand, obviously stupid. Chiang Kai-shek and his loyal lackey Zhang Qun repeatedly said that they wanted peace, but it was only the Communist Party that wanted civil war, but even so, they still did not abandon the "consistent policy" of "political solution." There is no need to recount history. Just look at the fact that as soon as the students shouted the slogan of "opposing civil war," they—starting with Chiang Kai-shek himself—immediately put the red hat of the Communist Party on the students and ordered the military police to kill them without mercy, and the truth is completely exposed. Is there a more ridiculous contradiction in the world? Chiang Kai-shek wants peace, but he wants to kill all those who oppose civil war; the Communist Party wants civil war, but all those who resolutely oppose civil war are Communists; students and workers oppose civil war, so they are Communists; students and workers oppose hunger, so they are Communists; students and workers oppose the trampling of human rights and foreign aggression, so they are Communists. In short, all good things and all glory belong to the Communist Party; therefore, the Communist Party is "outrageous." And on the other hand, Chiang Kai-shek is the most remarkable sage and hero of all time, so the schools run by Chiang Kai-shek during his twenty years of dictatorial tutelage (without a single Communist Party member participating) have all without exception been given the conclusion that "What good is it for the state to have such schools"; and the students of these schools have been rated as "Why pity such unruly and violent youth." Can Chiang Kai-shek's fascist intimidation today make the great Chinese youth and the great Chinese people tremble with fear, as Chiang Kai-shek himself did in the past when the Japanese attacked and now when the Americans are angry? Forget it! It must be known that Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the country, dictatorship, and civil war have long hindered the interests and freedom of 450 million people; "then their freedom will not be protected by the law but should be subject to the sanctions of the law," then what good is it for the state to have such a "government" and why pity such an unruly and violent "chairman"! Therefore, Chiang Kai-shek's terror tactics this time will not cause panic among the masses, but only show Chiang Kai-shek's own panic! Xiang Yu said at Gaixia: "Has the Han obtained all of Chu? Why are there so many people of Chu!" Chiang Kai-shek calls the masses of Beijing, Shanghai, Pingjin Communists and subjects them to fascist frenzy repression, which is also out of the same doomsday mood! Even if Xiang Yu killed a few more people at that time, what could he do to save himself from slitting his throat at the Wujiang River? Even if Chiang Kai-shek kills a few more people today, the people who need to eat still have to eat, the people who want to live still have to live, the Chinese youth will still move forward, and the Chinese people will still win. All of this is already undeniable and unchangeable! So what good is it to continue doing evil to avoid one's inevitable demise!?

### 蒋介石的末路

　　蒋介石的末路
    五月对于蒋介石多么不吉利呀！蒋介石在进攻解放区的军事战线上遭遇了严重的危机，在压迫剥削人民的经济战线和政治战线上，同样遭遇了严重的危机。由于粮价狂涨引起的五月初旬以来的各地粮食危机和“米骚动”刚在开始，京、沪、汉、平、津、青、浙、赣等地以反内战反饥饿挽救教育危机为中心口号的学生运动又达到了新的高潮；其波澜之壮阔，按蒋介石自己的话说：“为以往任何时期所未有。”蒋政府为此特在十八日公布了所谓“维持社会秩序临时办法”，命令各地方当局对于一切“越级”的或十人以上的请愿和罢课、罢工、罢业、游行示威或其他“扰乱公安时事”，“采取紧急处置，作有效之制止”。同时蒋介石、张群、朱家骅等人都发表了谈话，大肆其污蔑恫吓。蒋介石的谈话面目尤其凶恶，说学生们如“妨及公众（二字应读为蒋介石）之利益与他人（二字应读为蒋介石）之自由，则其自由即不受法律之保障而应受法律之制裁”。因为，“国家何贵有如此之学校，亦何惜于如此恣肆暴戾之青年。为保障整个国家（四字应读为蒋介石）之生命与全体青年（四字应读为蒋介石）之前途，将不能不采取断然之处置。”但是，为生存而奋斗的青年，丝毫也没有畏缩。十九日上海各校学生在送别他们到南京请愿的代表以后，就举行了大游行。二十日南京各校学生和上海、杭州等地的学生代表举行了“京沪苏杭区十六个专科以上学校挽救教育危机联合大游行”。同日北平、天津各校学生也作了游行和街头演说。武汉、青岛等地学生都已罢课响应。蒋介石的军警宪特在北平南京两地，虽已打伤了并逮捕了几十个学生，同类的暴行虽还会继续出现，但是全国青年和全国人民的正义斗争，却决不会被任何这类“断然处置”压倒，这是可以断言的了。
    蒋介石说这次学生运动“为以往任何时期所未有”，他在这里的确是说破了一个重要的真理。这次学生运动有两个特点最是显著：第一是广泛。例如以蒋介石的师傅陈英士和蒋介石自己得名的浙江英士大学和江西中正大学，过去是没有参加过学生运动的，在这一次却站在斗争的前线。甚至蒋介石的党校“中央训练团”将官班团员，也在这次学生运动的高潮中提出了六项关于生活的要求。这是“为以往任何时期所未有”的。第二是勇敢。蒋介石不准学生罢课，学生就偏偏扩大罢课，蒋介石不准学生游行示威，学生们偏偏扩大游行示威；蒋介石不让学生坐车，学生就自己开车；蒋介石命令军警宪特殴打学生，学生就夺过他们手里的水龙，冲破他们的包围。一切蒋介石所故意装得庄严神圣的东西，都被群众当作狗屎一样抛弃得远远的，这在蒋介石统治纪录上也是“为以往任何时期所未有”的。这两个特点何自而来？运动广泛是因为从群众最迫切的需要——要吃饭、要和平出发。人没有不要吃饭的，但是蒋介石今天的统治却使中国大多数人（包括大多数大学生和大学教授）硬是没饭吃；人民的所以没有饭吃，是因为蒋介石发动了全国大内战，破坏了全国人民所力争的和平运动。勇敢是因为人民斗争的普遍化（不但有全国的学生的斗争，而且有全国的教员、职工、公务人员、市民和农民的斗争，特别是有解放区一万万数千万人民的伟大自卫战争），是因为蒋介石统治危机的表面化。中国近代只有三次群众运动可以和今天比较，就是一九一九年的五四运动，一九二五年的五卅运动，和一九三五年的一二九运动。但是这三次运动中的群众都没有像今天这样提出如此悲惨和如此普遍的反饥饿口号，也没有公然看到人民有如此强大的力量，公然看到反动的统治者如此摇摇欲倒。这就是这次群众运动的规模气概“为以往任何时期所未有”的真正理由。
    在无论什么伟大的群众运动面前（无论这个运动多么正义，在后来的历史记载上多么光荣圣洁。）有一个反动的统治集团曾经拱手让步呢？有一个反动的统治集团不曾向群众大肆其污蔑恫吓呢？蒋介石宣布所谓“维持秩序临时办法”，赤裸裸的暴露出：他的所谓“自由主义政府”的法西斯性质乃是蒋介石法西斯集团的疯狂性的表现，同时又是其日暮途穷极端虚弱的表现。蒋介石集团对于今天的学生运动和其他群众运动所采取的法西斯手段，一方面固然是毒辣，另一方面却显然是愚蠢。蒋介石及其忠实走狗张群口口声声说他们是要和平的，只是共产党要内战，但是即令如此，他们仍不放弃“政治解决”的“一贯方针”。用不着去数说历史了，只看这次学生们一叫出“反对内战”的呼声时，他们——从蒋介石本人起——就马上给学生戴上共产党的红帽子，命令军警格杀勿论，真相就完全暴露了。世界上难道还有比这更滑稽的矛盾吗？蒋介石是要和平的，但是他要把反对内战的人都杀死；共产党是要内战的，但是决死反对内战的人都是共产党；学生和工人反对内战，所以他们是共产党；学生和工人反对饥饿，所以他们是共产党；学生和工人反对摧残人权和外国侵略，所以他们是共产党。总之，一切好事一切光荣都属于共产党；所以共产党“大逆不道”。而另一方面呢，蒋介石是古往今来最了不起的圣贤豪杰，所以由蒋介石二十年独裁训政（没有一个共产党员参加）中办出来的学校都一无例外地得了个“国家何贵有如此学校”的定论；而这些学校的学生则被评为“亦何惜于如此恣肆暴戾之青年。”难道蒋介石集团今天这一套法西斯的恫吓就能使伟大的中国青年和伟大的中国人民吓得发抖，如同蒋介石自己在过去日本人进攻时和现在美国人生气时那样了吗？算了吧！须知蒋介石的卖国独裁内战，早已妨及四万万五千万人之利益与四万万五千万人之自由；“则其自由即不受法律之保障而应受法律之制裁”，则国家何贵有如此之“政府”亦何惜于如此恣肆暴戾之“主席”！因此蒋介石这次的恐怖手段，决不能造成群众的惊慌，而只是表现蒋介石自己惊慌罢了！项羽在垓下说：“汉皆已得楚乎？是何楚人之多也！”蒋介石把京沪平津的群众都称为共产党，而加以法西斯的疯狂镇压，也只是出于同样的末日的心情罢了！项羽当时纵然多杀几个人，何救于乌江的一刎？蒋介石今天纵然多杀几个人，但是要吃饭的人还是得吃饭，要活命的人还是得活命，中国的青年还是要前进，中国的人民还是要胜利，这一切都已是无可争辩，无可改变的了！那么继续作恶又何救于自己必不可免的灭亡！？
