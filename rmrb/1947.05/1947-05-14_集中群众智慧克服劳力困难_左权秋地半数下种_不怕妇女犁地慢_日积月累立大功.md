　　[This report from our Zuoquan correspondent] After the county-wide mobilization meeting, village cadres have been leading spring plowing with great enthusiasm, and more than half of the land has now been sown. The movement has shown the following characteristics:

　　1. Actively dispelling the fear of becoming rich, greatly improving the masses' production enthusiasm. The main obstacle to production at the beginning was the masses' fear of becoming rich. In Wangjiazhuang Village, 35 out of 50 middle peasants were afraid of becoming rich. An old man said, "I can't figure out the policy." Many people requested clarification of the policy. Some also raised questions: If a "cave dwelling household" does not want to produce and remains a "cave dwelling" forever, will we fill it in again and again? Because the cadres had completely dispelled their fear of becoming rich, they returned to their villages and participated in discussions with the masses, using the government's laws protecting property rights as a basis to repeatedly explain that the Party's policy was to fight "exploitation" not "wealth." After the masses understood the Party's policy, their production enthusiasm greatly increased. At the Tongtan livestock fair, liberated peasants from Wujia@ and two other villages bought 21 head of livestock in one day. Ma Fubao, a rich peasant in Kou Shang Village, initially refused to work after three rounds of liquidation. Later, he realized that he was being struggled against because of exploitation, not because of wealth, and immediately joined a mutual aid team. He and his son transported goods for the team for two months, earning a total of 109,000 yuan. Song Fangcheng, a landlord in Sucheng, after learning that the government's policy was to protect those who became prosperous through labor, went up the mountain to cut firewood every day, cutting 60 bundles of firewood this spring. Liu Liuyuan, a landlord in Dianshang, reclaimed nine mu of wasteland, and Liu Baojin reclaimed twelve mu.

　　2. Using various methods to solve the problem of labor shortage: According to statistics from the Fifth and Seventh Districts, there are a total of 3,150 laborers, of which more than 800 are used for military service and other support (about one-quarter). Compared to last year, Changjieyan Village has one-third fewer laborers. However, after the masses' concerns were dispelled and their production enthusiasm was stimulated, more ways to overcome difficulties emerged. The following methods have been devised in various villages to solve the labor shortage: 1. Assign work according to land sections, with clear division of labor. The elderly cultivate the land, semi-able-bodied people dig side embankments, and the able-bodied people, except those serving in the military, transport manure and cultivate sloping land. Evaluate and record points equally, and those serving in the military also uniformly record points and convert them into work points. Changjieyan Village used this method to complete a five-day plan in four days, saving 30 workdays. 2. Organize female labor to participate in production: Under the influence of Wang Xiaoying, the female street leader in Hama Tan, the women went to the fields after the militia left. Xiao Ying said, "The militia is doing great deeds on the front line, and we are helping with spring plowing with small deeds. Accumulate small deeds into great accomplishments from daily work to monthly work." Li Yuxian and two others used plows to cultivate the land, Xia Yindi spread manure and planted seeds, and there were more than a dozen who could not work. Those with children cooked, cut grass, carried water, and fed livestock at home. Three women in Xiaolingdi pulled a plow, overcoming the shortage of animal power. 3. Advocate squeezing time, and distribute the extra production separately. Baiyu Village proposed: Get up early and work late without resting at noon. Except for the elderly, everyone else works in the fields without rest. The extra work done is divided the same as regular work, which greatly improved labor efficiency.

　　3. Pay more attention to careful cultivation and meticulous work in the rush to sow: Villages such as Liang Gou and Tong Tan have technical guidance and research organizations. Shuipo organized all the village's labor and livestock power, divided labor according to ability and technology, and gave full play to each person's skills. Those with good skills get more points.

　　The spring plowing movement is continuing to advance throughout the county. It is expected that by the 15th, except for a few areas with hotter climates, the entire county will have completed sowing.

　　集中群众智慧克服劳力困难
    左权秋地半数下种 
    不怕妇女犁地慢
    日积月累立大功
    【本报左权讯】全县动员会后，各村干部均以极饱满的热情领导春耕，现已有半数以上土地完成下种。运动中表现出如下特点：
    一、主动解除怕富思想，群众生产情绪大大提高；开始生产的主要障碍是群众中的怕发家思想，王家庄村五十个中农，有三十五个怕富。一个老汉说：“对政策摸不着底。”很多人有弄清政策的要求。还有的提出：圪洞户老不想生产，永远是圪洞，是不是一次又一次的来填等问题。由于干部已经完全解除了怕富顾虑，因此回村后分头参加到群众中去酝酿，并以政府保障财权的法令做依据，反复解释，让群众从自己的经验中认识党的政策是斗“剥削”不是斗“富”。群众对党的政策有了了解之后，生产情绪大大提高。桐滩骡马大会上，武家＠等三村翻身农民，在一天内就买了二十一个牲口。口上村富农马富保经过三次清算，起初不愿劳动，后来弄通自己是因剥削被斗而不是因富被斗，马上参加了互助组，父子二人给组内运输两个月，共赚洋十万九千元。粟城地主宋方成自知道政府劳动起家要保障法令后，每天上山割柴，一春天割了六十捆柴。店上地主刘六元开荒九亩，刘保金开荒十二亩。
    二、用各种方法解决劳力缺乏问题：按五、七两个区统计：共有劳力三千一百五十个，参战支差等即用八百多个（约占四分之一强），长节岩村今年与去年比较，劳力减去三分之一强。但在群众顾虑解除，生产热情被启发之后，克服困难的办法也就多起来了。各村在解决劳力困难上曾想出了以下办法：一、按地段作活，明确分工，老年人耕地，半劳力刨边堰，壮年人除参战外，送粪、刨坡地。等价评分记分，参战人员也统一记分折工。长节岩村采用这一办法，五日计划四日完成，省工三十个。二、组织妇女劳力参加生产：蛤蟆滩在女街长王小英影响下，民兵一走，妇女们下了地，小英说：“民兵前方立大功，咱们帮助春耕立小功。由日功到月功，积累小功成大功。”李玉仙等三人捉犁耕地，夏引第撒粪溜籽，还有十几个不能劳动。有小孩的在家做饭、切草、担水、喂牲口。小岭底三个妇女拉一犁，克服了畜力困难。三、提倡挤时间，挤出的生活另外分。柏峪村提出：起早搭黑不歇晌，除上年纪人休息外，其余到地都不休息，赶出的活与平时活一样折分，这样，大大提高了劳动效率。
    三、突击下种中更要注意精耕细作：梁沟、桐滩等村都有技术指导研究的组织。水坡是将全村劳畜力全部组织起来，按能力技术分工，充分发挥各个人一技之长，谁会什做什，技术好的多得分。
    现春耕运动在全县范围内继续推进，预计在十五日左右除少数气候较热地区外，全县可全部完成下种。
