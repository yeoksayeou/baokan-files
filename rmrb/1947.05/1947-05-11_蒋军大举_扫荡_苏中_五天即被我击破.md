Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 9th: Chiang Kai-shek's largest "mopping-up" operation against Central Jiangsu lasted only five days before being crushed. After suffering defeats and losing 4,100 troops in the battles of Libao and Dazhongji, Chiang's troops temporarily halted their "encirclement and suppression" of the area south of the Hai-Tai Line and east of Rugao on April 23rd. They pieced together remnants of the 49th Division and the 102nd Brigade of the Reorganized 4th Division, totaling about five regiments, and launched a retaliatory "mopping-up" operation against the Liangtai (East Tai, North Tai) area, supported by four Chiang aircraft. Simultaneously, the people's armed forces of the First Sub-district in southern Central Jiangsu seized the opportunity to attack the edge of the Huangqiao area. The Second Sub-district advanced into the Jiangdu and Gaoyou areas, recovering large swathes of lost territory. The Ninth Sub-district briefly recovered the important town of Juegang on the 28th of last month, forcing the Chiang troops "mopping-up" Liangtai to concentrate their forces and advance slowly, camping in wheat field ditches at night. On the 26th, they retreated after reaching a point five li north of Panjia. The next day, under the resistance of the militia, they fled in panic towards Xiaohai and Shenzao, and scurried back to their strongholds. This largest "mopping-up" operation became known as the "turtle-paced parade" among the masses in Liangtai. In their retreat, Chiang's troops adopted a scorched-earth policy, causing the largest fire disaster in eight years of the War of Resistance. Only two out of 200 homes remained in the entire town of Panjia, and only three out of over 300 homes remained in the town of Sancang, and only a dozen out of over 200 homes remained in the town of Yicang. Over 2,000 homes were burned in the dozens of li passed by Chiang's troops. For two days, the fire lit up the sky and could be seen from a hundred li away. The cries of the people shook the surrounding dozens of li.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 1st: A reporter from the Central Jiangsu Branch reported the details of the large-scale arson committed by Chiang's troops in Dazhongji, stating that on April 21st, after being surrounded by the People's Liberation Army, Chiang's troops set fire to the entire town. After the battle, thick smoke still stung the faces of the people, the charred bodies crackled in the piles of fire, and groups of people stamped their feet and wailed beside the rubble. Amidst the crackling of wood on the bridge, the faint sound of heart-rending cries of "Help..." could be heard. The soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and the militia tried their best to rescue people. After the fire was extinguished, they pried open the rubble and dug out a piece of charred remains the size of a leg, the human shape still discernible. This was the elderly mother of fortune-teller Xie Helong, over seventy years old, who met her end in the flames of the reactionaries. The daughter of old Mrs. Chen Yushan outside the east gate, when Chiang's troops set fire, she screamed "Help!" and was immediately stabbed in the stomach by a Chiang soldier's bayonet, her intestines spilling out along with the blade, and she died with a miserable cry. At that time, more than a dozen people died under the bayonets of Chiang's troops while trying to put out the fire. After the fire was extinguished, the reporter inspected the entire town. Dozens of silk and cloth shops, grain stores, and cotton companies on the most prosperous Guangming Street were completely destroyed. The newly built enclosure of over a hundred new thatched houses built after the liberation in 1945 was also reduced to ashes. In total, over 400 houses in the town were burned down, and over 240 households and over 500 people were left with nothing. The major merchants on Guangming Street alone lost 450 million Central China currency. Zhang San Grain Store, which suffered the greatest loss, had over 2,500 shi of rice and other grains burned. Dasheng Cotton Mill had 5,000 dan of cotton burned. According to the citizens, Chiang's troops had planned the arson for days. Several days before, they collected all the kerosene from the kerosene shops and the residents' kerosene lamps in the town, about 45 boxes, and when the battle was intense, they poured it all on the doors and windows of the houses and set them on fire.

　　蒋军大举“扫荡”苏中
    五天即被我击破
    【新华社华中九日电】蒋军对苏中规模最大的一次“扫荡”，为时仅五天，即被粉碎。蒋军自李堡、大中集两役残败折兵四千一百后，四月二十三日特停止对海泰线南及如（皋）东之“清剿”，拚凑四十九师残部及整四师一○二旅等共约五个团兵力，以四架蒋机配合，向两台（东台台北）地区进行报复“扫荡”。与此同时，苏中南线一分区人民武装乘虚进击黄桥边缘区，二分区间江（都）、高（邮）地区进军，恢复大块失地，九分区于上月二十八日一度收复重镇掘港，逼使“扫荡”两台蒋军始终集中兵力，齐头龟步前进，夜晚露营麦田沟中。二十六日，行至潘家＠北五里随即缩回。翌日在民兵阻击中，仓惶折向小海、沈灶，窜返各据点。这一规模最大的“扫荡”，遂成为两台群众口中之“龟步游行”。蒋军在败退中，采取烧光政策，造成抗战八年中未有之大火灾。潘家＠全镇二百家仅存两家，三仓镇三百余家仅存三家，一仓镇二百余家仅存十余家。蒋军经过之数十里内，被烧两千家以上。两天中火光烛天，百里外可见。人民号哭之声，震撼十数里外。
    【新华社华中一日电】苏中分社记者报导大中集蒋军大放火详情称：四月廿一日，大中集蒋军陷入解放军重围后，纵火焚烧全镇。战后浓烟仍熏炙人面，火堆中烧焦的尸体嗤嗤作响，瓦砾旁尽是顿足号哭的人群。大桥边木材爆裂声中，隐约听到撕裂心肺的“救命呵……”的惨叫声。解放军战士和民兵竭力抢救，火熄后，挑开瓦砾，掘出一块腿大的焦炭，人形依然可辨，这是测字先生谢贺龙的老母，七十余岁残年，就这样结束在反动派的火焰中。东门外陈雨山老太太的女儿，当蒋军放火时，她惊叫一声“救命呵”，即被蒋军一刺刀戳进肚子，肠子随着刀锋流出，惨叫而死。当时为救火而死在蒋军刺刀下的达十余人。火熄后记者巡视全镇，最繁荣的光明街数十家绸缎布庄、粮行、棉花公司等尽付一炬。一九四五年解放后新建的大围子百余间簇新的草屋，也化成灰烬。总计全镇烧毁房屋四百余间，二百四十余户五百余人口变成一无所有，仅光明街大商家即损失华中币四万五千万元，损失最大的张三粮行，被焚大米等二千五百余石，大生棉花厂被焚棉花五千余担。据市民谈：蒋军放火，蓄意有日，数天前即将全镇洋油店及居民点灯洋油全部收集，约四十五箱，战斗激烈时，即全部倾倒各家门窗上，纵火焚烧。
