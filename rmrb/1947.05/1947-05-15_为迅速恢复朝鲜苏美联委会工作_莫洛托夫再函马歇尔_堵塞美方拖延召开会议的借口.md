Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th – TASS reports: Molotov sent a letter to Marshall on April 19, proposing that the Soviet-American Joint Commission on Korea resume work on May 20. Marshall replied to Molotov on May 2, stating that he had considered Molotov's letter and had taken note of Molotov's statement that the Joint Commission should resume work "on the basis of strict implementation of the Moscow Conference agreement on the Korean issue," and explained the meaning of the phrase "strict implementation." Molotov replied to Marshall again on May 7, stating: As I understand it, your proposal is that an agreement on the conditions for consultation with Korean democratic parties and social organizations should be reached before the Joint Commission resumes work. The exchange of letters between the Soviet and American commanders in Korea discussed this issue. As I pointed out in my previous letter, the opinions of the two sides have greatly converged as a result of this exchange of letters. In his letter of November 26, 1946, the Soviet commander in Korea put forward the following proposal as the basis for resuming the work of the Joint Commission: "1. The Joint Commission should consult with all democratic parties and organizations that fully support the Moscow Conference resolution on the Korean issue. 2. The parties and social organizations invited to participate in the Joint Commission's consultations should not send representatives who have actively opposed the Moscow resolution to the consultations. 3. The parties and social organizations invited to consult with the Joint Commission should not, and will not, oppose or incite others to oppose the Moscow resolution on the work of the Joint Commission. Otherwise, with the agreement of both delegations, such parties and social organizations will be refused further consultation with the Joint Commission." In his letter of December 24, 1946, the American commander in Korea agreed to accept this suggestion of the Soviet commander and proposed the following revisions as the basis for resuming the work of the Joint Commission: "Proposal 1: Parties and organizations that have signed the declaration in Communiqué No. 5 are eligible to be designated to participate in preliminary consultations, as such signing should be regarded as a good faith expression of full support for the Moscow resolution. Proposal 2: I believe that parties or organizations that have issued this declaration are authorized to send such a representative who they believe can best present to the Joint Commission their views on the implementation of the Moscow resolution. If, for very important reasons, the representative is deemed to impede the implementation of the Moscow resolution or to be hostile to one of the Allied countries, the Joint Commission may, by mutual agreement, request the party or organization that issued such a declaration to send another representative to replace him. Proposal 3: Regarding this point, I propose the following provision: Individuals, parties, and social organizations who are invited to participate in the Joint Commission's consultations because they signed the declaration in Communiqué No. 5 shall not instigate or encourage demonstrations against the work of the Joint Commission or against one of the Allied Powers or against the implementation of the Moscow resolution. Otherwise, the individual, party, or social organization will be excluded from further consultation with the Joint Commission. The decision to exclude the individual, party, or social organization shall be made with the agreement of the delegations in the Joint Commission." In order to quickly resume the work of the Joint Commission and establish a Korean provisional democratic government, I am prepared to accept the above-mentioned revisions proposed by the American commander. I hope that there will no longer be any reason to delay the convening of the Joint Commission. In your reply, you said that the United States government is now considering constructive plans for restoring Korea's economic development and cultural and political construction. I believe that in accordance with the Moscow Conference resolution on Korea, after completing the task of establishing a Korean provisional democratic government, the Joint Commission should, with the participation of this provisional government, study the proposals put forward by the United States and the Soviet Union regarding assistance or aid to the Korean people's political, economic, and social progress, the development of democratic self-government, and the completion of Korean national independence, and should propose agreed recommendations on these issues.

　　为迅速恢复朝鲜苏美联委会工作
    莫洛托夫再函马歇尔
    堵塞美方拖延召开会议的借口
    【新华社陕北十三日电】据塔斯社讯：莫洛托夫于四月十九日致函马歇尔，提议朝鲜苏美联合委员会于五月二十日恢复工作；马歇尔于五月二日函复莫洛托夫，谓彼已考虑莫氏之函件，对莫氏所提“要在严格执行莫斯科会议关于朝鲜问题之协议的基础上”恢复苏美联合委员会工作的声明已予注意，并对“严格执行”一语有所解释。莫洛托夫又于五月七日函复马歇尔，略称：据我的了解，你的提议是：联合委员会恢复工作之前，应先获致的朝鲜各民主政党和社会团体协商的条件之协议。苏美驻朝鲜军司令间的书信往还就是讨论这问题的。如我上次函件中指出的，此书信往还的结果，双方意见已大大接近。苏驻朝鲜军司令在其一九四六年十一月二十六日的函件中，提出下列提议作为恢复联合委员会工作的基础：“一、联合委员会应与完全拥护莫斯科会议关于朝鲜问题决议的各民主政党与团体协商。二、被邀参加联合委员会协商的政党和社会团体不应派遣曾积极反对莫斯科决议者为代表来协商。三、被邀与联合委员会协商的政党和社会团体，不应而且将不反对或激起别人反对关于联合委员会工作的莫斯科决议。否则，经两代表团同意，将拒绝该类政党和社会团体与联合委员会的进一步协商。”美驻朝鲜军司令一九四六年十二月二十四日的信同意接受苏军司令的这一建议。并提出下列修正以作恢复联合委员会工作的基础：“第一项提议：曾签署第五号公报中宣言的党派及团体有资格被指定参加初步协商，因该种签署应视为全力支持莫斯科决议之善意的表示。第二项提议：我认为曾发表该宣言的党派或团体是被授权派遣这样一种代表，此代表在他们认为是能最好地对联合委员会陈述他们对实行莫斯科决议之意见的。该代表如因十分重要的理由被认为阻碍莫斯科决议之实行或与盟国之一敌对时，联合委员会经相互同意，可要求曾发表此种宣言的该党派或团体另派代表代替之。第三项提议：关于这一点，我提议作如下规定：因签过第五号公报中之宣言而被邀参加联合委员会协商的个人、党派及社会团体不得煽动或怂恿示威行动，以反对联合委员会的工作或反对同盟强国之一或反对实行莫斯科决议。否则该个人、党派或社会团体将被摒除而不能与联合委员会作进一步的协商。对于该个人、党派或社会团体的摒除的决定，应由联合委员会中的代表团同意为之。”为了迅速恢复联合委员会的工作和建立朝鲜临时民主政府，我准备接受上述美军司令所提的上述修正。我希望如此不会再有任何理由以拖延联合委员会的召开。阁下回信中说美国政府现正考虑恢复朝鲜经济发展及文化与政治的建设性计划。我认为遵照莫斯科会议关于朝鲜的决议，在完成建立朝鲜临时民主政府的工作后，联合委员会应在此临时政府参加下，研讨美苏双方提议关于帮助或援助朝鲜人民政治的经济的和社会的进步，发展民主自治政府和完成朝鲜国家独立之议案，并应提出在这些问题上协议的建议。
