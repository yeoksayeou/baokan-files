Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 2nd. The spokesperson of the Jidong Military Region issued a solemn statement regarding the atrocities of the US Marine Corps aircraft bombing and strafing the Ninghe liberated area for days since May 5th, stating: The US military has coordinated with Chiang's troops to attack our Jidong liberated area more than once. We have repeatedly admonished and reminded the US imperialists that your attempt to turn China into a second Philippines will only earn hatred and resolute resistance from the Chinese people, until the US imperialist reactionary policies and Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous dictatorship are buried together. This time (the night of the 4th), when our guerrillas attacked the Jiang army's internal war ammunition depot in Xinhe, the US military blatantly attacked our guerrillas. Afterwards, they repeatedly used aircraft to reconnoiter our Ninghe area, coordinating with the attack of the 168th Regiment of the 56th Division of the 92nd Army of the Jiang army, and bombed and strafed Ningchegu, Panzhuang, Xiditou, Tianzhongzhuang and other places. We hereby solemnly declare that regardless of whether the US military coordinates with Chiang's army or independently attacks the liberated areas, the military and civilians in our region will resolutely implement self-defense, and the US side will be responsible for all serious consequences.

　　冀东军区发表声明
    美军再犯我决自卫
    【新华社晋察冀二日电】冀东军区发言人顷对本月五日以来塘沽美陆战队飞机连日侵入宁河解放区轰炸扫射暴行发表严正声明称：美军配合蒋军向我冀东解放区进攻已非一次，我曾屡次规劝并屡次提醒美帝国主义者，你们想把中国变为菲律滨第二，只会从中国人民方面获得憎恨与坚决的抵抗，直至美帝国主义反动政策与蒋介石卖国独裁一起埋葬为止。此次（四日夜）我游击队袭击新河蒋军内战军火仓库时，美军竟悍然向我游击队攻击，事后又迭以飞机向我宁河地区侦察，配合蒋军九十二军五十六师一六八团之进攻，并在宁车沽、潘庄、西堤头、田重庄等地轰炸扫射。兹特郑重声明：无论美军配合蒋军或单独向解放区进攻，我区军民坚决实行自卫，其一切严重后果概由美方负责。
