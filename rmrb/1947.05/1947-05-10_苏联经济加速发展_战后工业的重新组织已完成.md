　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th. TASS, Moscow: On the 3rd, the Pravda published an editorial entitled "Accelerating the Restoration and Development of the Economy," which stated: In the first year of the new Five-Year Plan, the post-war reorganization of industry has been completed, and five hundred restored and newly built factories have begun operations. Coal mines and the metal industry are being established in the south of our country. The lights of the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station and the Donets Basin Power Station are shining brightly. The tractor factories in Stalingrad and Kharkov have resumed operations. The economic life in areas that suffered from enemy invasion has been revived. The industrial output in these areas has increased by one-third compared to last year; the sown area of agriculture in 1946 has reached three-quarters of the pre-war level. Destroyed cities and villages are being rebuilt from ruins, and the socialist competition to complete the second year's plan of the post-war Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule in commemoration of the upcoming 30th anniversary of the October Revolution is expanding across the country. The editorial pointed out: The great potential and superiority of the socialist system, the absence of contradictions that capitalism cannot solve in our country, the invincible will and political unity of the Soviet people, and the experienced and wise leadership of the party of Lenin and Stalin—all of this guarantees the realism of the Soviet state's economic plans. Pravda called on the Soviet people to further increase the speed of work and use new savings to accelerate the development of the Soviet state's industry and agriculture.

    战后工业的重新组织已完成
    【新华社陕北六日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：三日真理报以“加速经济的复原和发展”为题，发表社论，略称：在新五年计划的第一年中，工业的战后重新组织已经完成了，五百座修复和新建的工厂已经开始工作。我国南部的煤矿同金属工业正在建立中。第聂泊水力站及顿内次盆地动力站的灯光辉煌地照耀着。在斯大林格勒同哈尔科夫的拖拉机厂已经重新工作。曾遭敌人侵略之害的地方的经济生活已复活了。在这些地方的工业生产量已经较之去年增加了三分之一；农业的播种面积在一九四六年时已经达到战前的四分之三。被摧毁的城市及乡村正在从断瓦颓垣中建造起来，为纪念即将到来的十月革命三十周年而先期完成战后五年计划中第二年计划的社会主义竞赛，正在全国日益扩大。社论指出：社会主义体系的极大潜在力及优越性，资本主义所无法解决的矛盾在我们国家里之不存在，苏联人民的无敌的意志及政治上的团结，列宁同斯大林党的有经验而智慧的领导——所有这一切都是苏维埃国家经济计划现实性的保证。真理报号召苏联人民再提高工作的速度，并利用新的储蓄去加速苏维埃国家的工业与农业的发展。
