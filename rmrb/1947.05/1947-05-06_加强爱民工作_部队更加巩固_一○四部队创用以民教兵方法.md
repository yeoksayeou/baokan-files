　　Strengthening the Work of Loving the People Makes the Troops More Consolidated
    The 104th Unit Creates a Method of Educating Soldiers with the People

    [Reported by This Newspaper] The rapid development of the rectification movement in the 104th unit and the thoroughness of the local work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to military families are important conditions. After the troops arrived in Yuanchao County, the government specially organized a supply station to solve the troop's supplies, and organized comfort groups and military family representative groups to visit the troops. Before the troops arrived, the landlords papered the windows, built the beds, cleaned up, and filled the lamps with oil; when the troops arrived, the masses welcomed them on both sides of the road; after settling in, the village cadres came to ask questions, the children came to help, the women helped the soldiers sew and wash clothes, and automatically comforted them. The soldiers said: "It's really great!" Meng, director of the Jinnan Administrative Office, also led a comfort group carrying a large number of comfort goods to the troops, and met with the soldiers in various troops, feeling like they were meeting their own family members, and listened to their reports on rear work. Director Meng and others also solicited opinions on rear work, which gave the troops great education and encouragement. As a result, the troops' various work and mass discipline have improved, and the systems of sitting in villages, making contact, and inspection have been universally established; the "full water vat" movement is implemented in every village. The machine gun company of the 22nd unit's 12th regiment's × battalion carried 200 loads of water in five days, and Wang Shuanghai's squad of the sixth company carried 1,469 loads of water during the rectification; the soldier Ou Yonghe carried 390 loads of water alone. The third company of the 11th unit carried 478 loads of water in three days, and the Me Tingyin squad of the 11th unit carried 46 loads of water in two hours. The third company of the 15th unit picked up firewood to reduce the burden on the masses, and the third company picked up 900 jin of firewood in two days. The fourth company, in order to rectify discipline, specially convened a symposium of work team members to implement division of labor, one group specializing in checking whether the water vat is full, one group checking the return of borrowed items, and one group checking cleanliness and hygiene. Li Ruxiang's squad lived in the home of a martyr's family member, and because of their cordial labor on his behalf, the landlord treated the whole squad as his own sons. Since the arrival of the direct unit of the 23rd unit, the landlord has not carried a load of water. When the × battalion of the 23rd unit dressed up and set off for exercises, the masses thought the troops were leaving and stopped them from leaving; they were released only after explanation. The × regiment invited the district head, village head, and women's association director to report on land reform and the distribution of fruits. The × regiment invited a teacher who brought new recruits to tell three stories of escaped soldiers returning to the team, farmers turning over, and voluntarily joining the army. The soldiers reflected: "It's better than five days of classes." Other troops commonly invite village chiefs and farmers' association chairmen to make reports. This method not only makes military-political and military-civilian relations closer, but also makes the troops' training methods develop from officers teaching soldiers, soldiers teaching officers, and soldiers teaching soldiers, to political education of soldiers and people educating soldiers.

　　加强爱民工作  部队更加巩固
    一○四部队创用以民教兵方法
    【本报讯】一○四整训运动的飞速开展，当地拥军优军工作的深入为一重要条件。部队进至元朝县后，政府专门组织了兵站解决部队供给，组织慰问团、军属代表团分赴各部队拜访。部队来到前，房东们糊好窗户、搭好铺、打扫干净、添满灯油；部队来时，群众夹道欢迎；驻定后，村干来问长问短，儿童来帮这帮那，妇女会替战士们缝洗衣服，并自动慰劳，战士们说：“实在太好啦！”冀南行署孟主任并率慰问团携带大批慰劳品赶到部队，并到各部队和战士们见面，战士觉得象见了自己家里人一样，听他们报告后方工作。孟主任等也多方征询对于后方工作的意见，这给部队很大的教育和鼓舞。于是，部队的各种工作、群众纪律亦提高了一步，坐村、联系、检查等制度普遍的建立起来了；满缸运动无村不实行。二二部一二部队×营机枪连五天担水二百担，六连王双海班整军中共挑水一千四百六十九担，战士欧永和一个人就挑了三百九十担。三连三天挑水四百七十八担，一一部队么廷印班两个钟头挑水四十六担。一五部队三连为减轻群众负担，亲自拾柴，三连于两天内拾柴九百斤。四连为整顿纪律，特召集一个工作组员座谈会，实行分工，一组专检查水缸满不满，一组检查借物送还，一组检查清洁卫生。李如祥班住一烈属家里，由于亲切代他劳动，房东把全班当做自己亲儿子一样看待。二三部队直属队驻地自部队来后，房东没挑过一担水。二三部队×营着装出发演习，群众以为部队出发，拦住不让走；后来经过解释才放开。×团请区长、村长、妇会主任报告土地改革及分果实情形，×团请带新兵来的一位教员讲了逃亡归队的、农民翻身队的、自动参军的三个故事，战士反映：“比上五天课还强。”其他部队请村长、农会长做报告的很普遍，这种方法不仅使军政、军民关系更加密切，而且使部队练兵的方法上从官教兵、兵教官、兵教兵，发展到政教兵，民教兵。
