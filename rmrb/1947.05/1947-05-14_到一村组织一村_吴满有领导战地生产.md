Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 11th: Reporter Wen Jie reports: Wu Manyou, a special-class labor hero of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, is now a clear banner combining production and combat. Wherever he goes, he sets off a production upsurge to support the war. On March 17th, when the enemy scurried to Yangjiapan, 25 miles southeast of Wu Manyou's Wu's Jujube Orchard, Wu Manyou's entire family drove four oxen, three donkeys, and one horse, and safely transferred to a certain place. After Wu Manyou arrived in the village, he immediately publicized and promoted the masses in the village to start production. Some of the masses were unclear about the enemy situation and their emotions were unstable, so Wu Manyou promoted everyone to organize a rotating sentry team to monitor the enemy's actions. Wu Manyou personally led his eldest son, Zhongfu, and his hired hand, Lao Yang, to drive four large bulls to help the masses in the village produce without compensation. In 20 days, they helped the village with 40 oxen-days and 28 man-days, promoting the village to cultivate 180 qing (3 mu per qing) of land, accounting for 72 percent of last year's cultivated area, influencing and promoting the production enthusiasm of the two villages before and after, cultivating 210 qing, accounting for 53 percent of last year's cultivated area. Now, the masses in the village are not only confident of completing last year's cultivated area, but also guarantee to open up more wasteland and prepare to rebuild their homes. In addition to stepping up production, Wu Manyou never forgets to support the front line; on April 27th, when the government mobilized to transport military grain, the village had four horses. The masses loved their horses and were unwilling to use them for transportation, and planned to replace them with oxen. Wu Manyou immediately persuaded them: "Oxen are slow, and each ox takes 20 days to go back and forth, delaying 20 oxen-days. If the troops can't eat, the problem will be big. If you are unwilling to use horses to deliver, I can use donkeys to replace you." This persuasion moved those who had horses, and they immediately took their horses to join the grain transportation team. Wu Manyou said: "Go with peace of mind, I will help you transport manure, grind, and roll." In nine days, he helped the village with 27 oxen-days. The masses, seeing the newly cultivated land and eating the newly ground rice, all said in unison: "The labor hero is indeed a labor hero."

    【新华社西北十一日电】记者闻捷报导：陕甘宁边区特等劳动英雄吴满有，现在是一面鲜明的生产与战斗结合的旗帜。他走到那里，那里就掀起支援战争的生产热潮。三月十七日，当敌人窜抵吴家枣园东南二十五里之杨家畔时，吴满有全家赶着四条＠牛、三头驴、一匹马，安全转移至某地。吴满有到达该村后，立即宣传与推动该村群众动手生产。有些群众对敌情不明，情绪不定，吴满有又推动大家组织了轮流放哨队，监视敌人行动。吴满有亲自带着长子仲富、长工老杨，赶上四条大公牛无代价的帮助该村群众生产，二十天内共帮助该村四十个牛工、二十八个人工，推动该村耕完一百八十垧（三亩一垧）地，占去年耕地面积百分之七十二，影响推动了前后两村群众的生产热情，耕地二百一十垧，占去年耕地面积百分之五十三。现在该村群众不但有把握完成去年耕地面积，并保证增开荒地，准备重建家务。吴满有除加紧生产外，时时不忘支援前线；四月二十七日政府动员运送军粮，该村有马四匹，群众爱马，不愿用马驮送，拟以耕牛代替，吴满有即劝说：“牛走的慢，每一个牛来回二十天，误二十个牛工，不光耽误时间，部队吃不上问题就大啦，你们一定不愿用马送，我可以用驴代替你们去送。”这一劝说感动了有马的人，他们立即带上马参加了运粮队。吴满有说：“你们放心去吧，我帮你们驮粪、推磨、滚碾。”九天内共帮该村二十七个牛工。群众们看见新耕的地，吃着新碾的谷米，都异口同说：“劳动英雄到底是劳动英雄呵。”
