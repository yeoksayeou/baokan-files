　　“You Guys Are It!”
    Visiting Captured Hu Zongnan Soldiers
    Ouyang Shan
    The writer Ouyang Shan is currently in northern Shaanxi and recently participated in the work of a certain liberated soldiers' reception station. This is one of his short dispatches written for the "Border Region Masses Newspaper."
    After the Jiang army's 135th Brigade was annihilated at Yangma River, I saw one of their clerk sergeants in a certain place. This person was called Deng Fayu. When the 135th Brigade collapsed, he fled into the mountains, hiding during the day and running around at night. After four days, he was still caught by us. I asked him, "Why was the 135th Brigade so useless?" He was a 26-year-old young man with long hair. When he heard me ask this, he glared at me with a pair of bloodshot eyes and said indignantly, "How is the 135th Brigade useless?" I smiled and asked him, "If you were useful, why did you collapse so quickly?" Deng Fayu lowered his head and replied with great emotion, "Since the War of Resistance Against Japan, the 135th Brigade has never suffered a defeat. This time we were all very confident. We thought only bad teams like the 31st Brigade would be wiped out at Qinghuabian..." I continued, "Isn't the luck of your 135th Brigade the same as the luck of the 31st Brigade?" He nodded and sighed deeply, "Yes, yes, the reasoning is very simple. It's like hearing about something is not as good as seeing it. One mountain is always higher than another. Before I met the Eighth Route Army, I simply couldn't imagine that the Eighth Route Army would be so brave. On one hilltop, I saw the Eighth Route Army charging fiercely towards our machine gun positions. They charged like that three times in a row and broke us down. My God! Doesn't the Eighth Route Army have wings?... Later, when I escaped, I met our machine gun squad leader. He told me he ran ten miles in one breath before he felt his crotch was wet and sticky. It turned out that you charged so fiercely that he was so scared he peed his pants." Finally, he raised a thumb and said to me, "No problem at all, you guys are it."

　　“你们是这个！”
    访俘虏来的胡宗南兵
    欧阳山
    作家欧阳山现在陕北，最近曾参加某解放士兵招待所工作，这是他为《边区群众报》撰写的短篇通讯之一。
    蒋军一三五旅在羊马河被歼之后，我在一个地方看见了他们的一个文书上士。这个人叫做邓发玉，一三五旅崩溃的时候他逃到山里，白天藏着晚上乱跑，四天之后仍然叫咱们捉住了。我问他：“为什么一三五旅这样不中用？”他是一个廿六岁的年轻人，头上还留着长头发，听见我这样问，把一双熬得通红的眼睛向我一瞪，愤愤不平的说：“一三五旅怎么不中用？”我笑着问他：“要是中用的话为什么垮的这样快？”邓发玉垂着头十分感慨的回答我：“自从抗战以来，一三五旅从来没吃过败仗，这一回我们都很自信，我们以为只有三十一旅那样的坏队伍才会在青化砭被消灭……。”我接着说：“你们一三五旅的运气不是和三十一旅的运气一样的吗？”他点点头长长的叹了一口气说：“是的，是的，这道理也很简单，这就是闻名不如见面，一山还比一山高。我没有碰见八路军的时候，简直想不到八路军勇敢到这样的程度。在一个山头上我看见八路军向我们的机关枪阵地猛冲，那样的冲法连冲了三次，把我们冲垮了。我的老天爷！八路军莫不是长着翅膀的吗？……后来我逃出来时，碰见了我们的机枪班长，他告诉我他一口气跑了十里路，才觉得自己的裤裆湿粘粘的。原来你们冲得这样猛，把他的尿都吓得流出来了。”最后他翘起一个大姆指对我说：“没有一点问题，你们是这个”。
