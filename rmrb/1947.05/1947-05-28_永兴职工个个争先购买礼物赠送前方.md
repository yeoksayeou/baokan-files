　　Yongxing Employees Compete to Buy Gifts for the Front Lines
    [Reported by this newspaper] All employees and family members of the Yongxing Printing Bureau have been actively donating items, Jiao Chao currency, and comfort bags to慰劳 (offer comfort to) the soldiers at the front. Comrade Jia Bende of the First Factory made a comfort bag, but it wasn't good-looking, so he took it apart and remade it, and it turned out well. Comrade Yao Qin of the Third Factory went to Yangyi Town to buy locally-made cloth and made a comfort bag, exquisitely embroidered with the seven characters "Salute the Heroic Soldiers Who Kill the Enemy." Family members Chang Xiuqin, Zhang Shumin, and others either made comfort bags or sent慰劳品 (comfort items). Comrades Liu Mingsheng and Chen Ruiqing of the First Factory each donated a shirt, and cook Li Fusheng donated the towel he won as a prize and also donated 8,000 yuan. Comrade Li Yixin also donated a large red flower handkerchief that was given to his wife. All comrades in the Fifth Factory competed to buy ten large towels to慰问 (express sympathy and solicitude) the army. Within three days, the bureau's employees had donated three large boxes of慰劳品 (comfort items).

　　永兴职工个个争先购买礼物赠送前方
    【本报讯】永兴印刷局全体职工、家属，纷纷捐献物品、冀钞、慰问袋，慰劳前线将士。第一厂贾本德同志做了一个慰问袋，不好看，拆了重做，结果做好了。三厂姚勤同志特到阳邑镇买回土制市布做了一个慰问袋，精绣着“杀敌英雄人人敬”七个字。家属常秀琴、张淑民等或做慰问袋或送慰劳品。一厂刘铭升、陈瑞卿二同志各捐衬衣一件，炊事员李富生把得奖的毛巾献出，还捐了八千元。李亦信同志把赠送他爱人的一条大红花手巾也捐了出来。五厂全体同志都争购大毛巾十条劳军。三天内全局职工即捐出慰劳品三大箱。
