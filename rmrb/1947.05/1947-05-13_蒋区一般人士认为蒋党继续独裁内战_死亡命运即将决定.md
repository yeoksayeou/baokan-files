Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th. According to reports from Peiping (Beijing): The China Democratic National Construction Association (i.e. the Third Party), in its declaration in Shanghai regarding the Chiang government's "reorganization", emphasized that this "new government" is merely a chaotic group of compradors, financial magnates, landlords, warlords, bureaucrats and politicians, without the participation of parties and national capitalists that truly represent the masses of the people, and that these parties are still subject to extreme oppression. Another report: Professor Deng Chumin, a member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, said in Hong Kong: "The reorganization of the government actually does not arouse the interest of the Chinese people at all. It is generally believed that the fate of the Kuomintang's dictatorial autocracy is about to be decided, and continuing the civil war will bring death to the Chiang government." He also said: "The participation of the Social Democratic Party in the government has exposed their deceptive posture of constantly boasting as 'scientists', and allows us to see that they are just a group of selfish and self-interested people."
	
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th. Public opinion in Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas is mocking the participation of the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party in the Chiang government. Wenhui Daily referred to it as "Xi Ren Getting Married," because "their participation was, in fact, a foregone conclusion. Meeting after meeting, discussion after discussion, was originally just a pose. When participating in the National Assembly, they said they might not participate in the government; when participating in the four institutions, they said they would not go in again until peace was restored; but now? In the end, they still stepped in. In *Dream of the Red Chamber*, Xi Ren's marriage also went through this general process." Note: When Hua Xiren got married, she cried and shouted, pretending to be pitiful, but in fact, her bargaining was very similar to the ugly behavior of the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party. The United Evening News also stated that the relationship between the Chiang government and the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party was just a process of "giving and taking" and "bargaining and returning."

　　蒋区一般人士认为蒋党继续独裁内战
    死亡命运即将决定
    【新华社陕北九日电】据北平报载：中国农工民主党（按即第三党）为蒋政府“改组”在沪发表宣言，强调指出此“新政府”只是买办财阀地主军阀官僚和政客凑成混沌一团的政府，而无真正代表人民大众的党派和民族资本家参加，而这些党派还受极端压迫。另讯：民盟中委邓初民教授在香港谈称：“政府的改组，实际上丝毫不能引起中国人民的兴趣。一般认为，国民社独裁专政的命运即将决定，内战打下去将给蒋政府带来死亡。”又称：民社党的参加政府，已戳穿他们时常自诩为“科学家”的欺骗姿态，而使我们能够看到他们只是一群自私自利者。
    【新华社陕北十一日电】蒋区舆论界对青民两党参加蒋政府、多加嘲讽。文汇报指为“袭人出嫁”，因为“他们的参加，事实上早成定论。开会复开会，讨论复讨论，本来是一种姿态。参加国大时说不一定参加政府；等到参加四机构时，又说非恢复和平不再进去；现在呢？终究还是踏进去了。红楼梦上袭人的出嫁，也是经这一般过程的。”按：花袭人出嫁时且哭且喊，装腔作势，其实讨价还价正与青民党人之丑态逼肖。联合晚报亦称蒋政府与青民两党的关系，只是“给与取”、“讨与还”的过程。
