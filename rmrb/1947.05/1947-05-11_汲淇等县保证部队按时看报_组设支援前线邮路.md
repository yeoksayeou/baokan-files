　　Jí, Qí, and Other Counties Ensure Troops Receive Newspapers on Time; Establish Postal Routes to Support the Front Lines
　　[News from our newspaper in Northern Henan] The military postal work of the past three months has proven that it is difficult to promptly and quickly deliver mail to highly mobile troops without combining it with general postal services. Troops' mail often chases after them, and postal workers at the front carry loads of newspapers, unable to find the intended recipients. For example, when the ××× unit was in Huī County, personnel from the accompanying military post office were sent to deliver the mail, but the unit had already moved. The mail was then carried to Jí County, where the unit had moved again. As a result, the accompanying military post office couldn't deliver the mail, and the troops couldn't read their newspapers. To overcome this difficulty, Jí County took the lead in organizing a postal route to support the front lines, with daily scheduled runs. The method was to combine it with district and village postal routes. Qí County and Huī County also organized similar routes successively, and the current mail delivery time is more stable than before. However, the following should be noted during organization: First, the strength of the postal route supporting the front lines should be appropriately allocated. The characteristic of this postal route is that mail is delivered as soon as it arrives, making it faster than general rural postal routes with daily runs. However, it is also a temporary route, making it difficult to estimate the required manpower. Therefore, it must be combined with rural postal services. If the troops are on a rural postal route, the enthusiasm of the original postal workers can be leveraged to solve the problem. In special circumstances, if the troops are on the edge of the county, in addition to maximizing our own efforts, the government can temporarily organize mass forces. Second, the accompanying military post office and the general post office should be closely integrated. The accompanying military post office generally has closer contact with the troops at the front, allowing them to understand the direction of troop movements. In addition to promptly notifying the central station (or bureau), they must also notify the local bureau to avoid the back-and-forth movement of mail, which wastes manpower and time. Upon receiving notification, the central station (or bureau) should immediately redirect the mail without delay. When the troops arrive in a certain county, they should also notify the local bureau as much as possible to facilitate timely delivery.

　　汲淇等县保证部队按时看报
    组设支援前线邮路
    【本报豫北讯】三个月来的军邮工作，证明不与普邮结合是很难及时迅速转递高度流动性的部队邮件的，部队邮件老在部队后面追，前方邮工同志担上一担报，一直找不着。如×××部在辉县时，随军局派人送去，部队已转移了，又担在汲县又转移了，结果是随军局送不出去，部队上看不到书报。为了克服这一困难，汲县先组织了一条支援前线邮路，逐日班期，办法是与区村邮线结合，淇县与辉县亦先后组织起来，目前的邮件时间较前稳定了。但在组织时应注意：一、支援前线邮路的力量要适当配备，这一邮路的特点，就是有邮件就送，比一般乡邮线速度快，逐日制，但他又是临时性的路线，很难估计需入多少，因之又得与乡邮结合，如果部队在乡邮线上，结合起来发扬原额邮工同志的积极性，就可解决了。如果是特殊情况，部队在本县的边沿上，除自己力量尽量发挥外，可以通过政府临时组织群众力量。二、随军局与普邮局要密切结合。随军局一般与前方部队联络较密切，他可以了解部队的转移的方向，除及时通知中心站（或局）外，同时要通知当地局，以免邮件的往返，浪费人力和时间。中心站（或局）接到通知立即改寄，不要停留。部队到某一县境时，尽量能也通知当地局一下，以便及时投递。
