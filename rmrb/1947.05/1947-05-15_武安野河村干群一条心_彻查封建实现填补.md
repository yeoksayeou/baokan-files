　　Wuan Yehe Village Cadres and Masses United as One
    Thoroughly Investigate Feudalism and Realize Filling and Replenishment
    [Report from this newspaper, Wuan] Cadres Zhang Younian, Zhang Cunian, Yang Fengchi, and others from Yehe Village in the Third District, frequently sacrificed their families during the War of Resistance to cooperate with our army in persisting in the struggle against the enemy. The losses to the masses were minimal during those eight years. This time, in resolving the relationship between cadres and the masses, they still maintained this revolutionary fine tradition and noble character, taking the initiative to let the masses offer opinions to them and returning the excess fruit they had divided. Influenced by them, nine other cadres, including Wu Yaoqing, Wang Ruzhen, and Zhang Zhilin, also returned the excess fruit, and the masses reflected, "They are truly resolutely revolutionary." After returning the fruit, they became even more active and responsible. As the movement developed, they led the masses deeper into the groups to conduct investigations into origins, class, and cutting off the tails, implementing the filling and leveling movement. It was discovered that the big landlords Yang Linchang and Yang Yanlin still had tails, that the families of two landlord soldiers had not been liquidated, and that twelve small landlords, such as Yang Laowu, who had rented out land in the past, had also not been liquidated. It was found that there were 158 households who had not thoroughly turned themselves over, including 29 new middle peasant households lacking land, 19 poor peasant households lacking land, 31 households without houses, and 17 households whose houses were not large enough. Then, a struggle was launched focusing on the big landlord Yang Linchang, totaling 236 mu of land, 182 rooms, 2,250 jin of grain, and clothing and other miscellaneous items valued at 3,297,200 yuan in silver dollars were cleared out. In addition, the village peasant association had accumulated 40 mu of fruit land, 67 rooms, 3,600 jin of grain, more than 600,000 yuan in shares in the coal kiln and lime kiln cooperatives, and many other miscellaneous items. This time, the slogan put forward was "Distribute it cleanly and distribute it fairly," and no tails would be left. The peasant association's shares, after deducting funds for village office and school expenses, were all given to the masses as stock; the distribution of fruit was based on households, combining "comparing family assets" with the needs of each household. Each household reported their needs, first receiving what they needed, and then supplementing the quantity with other items. Everyone felt very satisfied with this method. This time, 158 households received fruit, accounting for 40 percent of the total number of households in the village, and 19 poor peasant households rose to become middle peasants. During the distribution of fruit, all the fruit was put on display, greatly exciting the masses and strengthening their hatred of the landlords. Gao Jingyun's wife, a newcomer, said, "The cadres are so good this time, they even saw us." An old man said happily, "I thought my life was over, but I didn't expect this, Chairman Mao really manages everything thoroughly."

　　武安野河村干群一条心
    彻查封建实现填补
    【本报武安讯】三区野河村干部张有年、张存年、杨凤池等，抗战中经常舍己忘家配合我军坚持对敌斗争，八年中群众损失极小。这次解决干民关系，他们仍保持这种革命的优良传统与高尚品质，主动让群众向自己提意见，并退出多分果实。在他们影响下，又有武耀清、王如珍、张志林等九个干部退出多分果实，群众反映说：“人家真算革命坚决。”他们退出果实后，更加积极负责，随着运动的发展，又领导群众深入小组，进行查由、查阶级、割尾巴贯彻填平补齐运动。查出大地主杨林昌、杨炎林还有尾巴，两户地主军属未清算，历史上出租土地的杨老五等十二户小地主亦未清算；查出未翻透身户有一百五十八户，内有新中农缺地户二十九户，贫农缺地者十九户，没房子的三十一户，房子不够住的十七户。接着以大地主杨林昌为主展开了斗争，总计清算出土地二百三十六亩，房子一百八十二间，粮食两千二百五十斤，衣服被褥及其它杂件作价大洋三百二十九万七千二百元。此外，该村农会尚积存果实地四十亩，房子六十七间，粮食三千六百斤，入煤窑灰窑合作社股金六十余万元，及其它杂件尚多，这次提出口号是“分得净分得公”，决不留尾巴。农会股金除留下村公所学校经费基金外，全部给群众股票；果实分配是以户为单位，以“比家当”结合各户需要，由各户自报，先领取需要东西，然后以其它东西补足数量。这种办法大家感觉非常满意。此次得果实户为一百五十八户，占全村户数百分之四十，有十九户贫农上升为中农。在分配果实时，将全部果实集中展览，大大兴奋了群众，加强了对地主的仇恨心理。外来户高景云老婆说：“这次干部可好了，眼儿也看见咱了。”老汉高兴的说：“我说这一辈子就算完了，没想到还有这一下，毛主席真算管得透。”
