　　Liaoxi Our Army Recovers Liaoyuan
　　Liaodong Liberates Dongfeng, Annihilating an Enemy Regiment
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, Urgent Telegram, 25th] A unit of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army recovered Zhengjiatun (i.e., Liaoyuan), an important city in western Liaoning, yesterday (the 24th). The city is a junction point for the Si(ping)-Tao(nan) and Si(ping)-Tong(liao) railways, and one of the important logistical bases for the Chiang-Du troops. On May 23rd of last year, Chiang's 71st Army invaded and occupied the city, using it as a springboard for "nibbling" at the Liaoxi Liberated Area and Inner Mongolia region for a year. After the Democratic Allied Army recovered Wohutun, north of the city, on the 21st, it immediately surrounded it. Two battalions of the remnants of the 160th Regiment of the enemy's 71st Army's 87th Division abandoned the city and fled south on the 24th, and were completely annihilated at Lamadianzi, northeast of Bamiancheng. Zhengjiatun was then recovered on the same day. Another battalion of the remnants of Chiang's 87th Division is currently being surrounded and annihilated at the city's railway station.
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Liaodong Front, Urgent Telegram, 25th] A unit of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army recovered Dongfeng County town on the Mei(hekou)-Si(ping) line at 6:00 AM this morning (the 25th), annihilating a regiment of the Chiang-Du Youth Army's 2nd Division. The battle began at 6:00 PM last night (the 24th). After a fierce battle throughout the night, the entire defending enemy force was annihilated by 6:00 AM this morning. With the recovery of Dongfeng, the Si-Mei line has been cut off, and the defending enemy forces in Hailong and Meihekou are isolated. Note: Dongfeng was invaded and occupied by Chiang's New 6th Army and 52nd Army on May 23rd of last year, precisely one year ago.
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 26th] According to preliminary statistics, during the operations around Changchun from the 18th to the 21st of this month, the Northeast Democratic Allied Army captured 404 Chiang soldiers and officers (including 12 lieutenants), seized 222 rifles, 15 light and heavy machine guns, 12 carbine machine guns, 16 Thompson submachine guns, one vehicle (and destroyed three others), over 54,000 catties of gasoline, 26 parachutes, over 54,000 rounds of ammunition, and some other military supplies. They destroyed two airport warehouses and seven pillboxes.
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 26th] On the morning of the 25th, a unit of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army shot down a U.S.-made Chiang aircraft wreaking havoc over Yangmulinzi, more than ten li northeast of Siping. The plane crashed near Xiaoqiaozi in Yangmulinzi, and both the aircraft and its occupants were destroyed. During the Siping Campaign last year, the first record of shooting down a Chiang aircraft was also achieved in this area.
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Liaodong, 24th] This agency's accompanying reporter reports: When our army began attacking Shanchengzhen in the central section of the Shen(yang)-Ji(lin) line on the 13th, at the sound of gunfire, the citizens, disregarding the danger, stood on the buildings, hoping for our army to enter the city as soon as possible. At dawn the next day, our army entered the streets, and they rushed out to lead our army to annihilate the last resisting enemy forces in the fortified bunkers in Dongmenli. When our army victoriously entered the streets, residents gathered in the streets to welcome them. Merchants discussed how to comfort the Democratic Allied Army. The thirty-odd innocent people imprisoned in Chiang's police station were liberated, most of whom had resisted Chiang's army's conscription and grain robbery. A liberated white-haired old man repeatedly exclaimed, "The Eighth Route Army has come, the Eighth Route Army has come, the savior we have been longing for has come!" As soon as the gunfire ceased, some merchants opened their shops for business. The citizens hated the Chiang army's fortifications that blockaded them, and automatically rose up to dismantle them. Before dark, more than a hundred pillboxes and barbed wire fences spread across the seven or eight li-long street were swept away. With the assistance of the masses, many Chiang agents who had hidden and fled during the war were caught on the same day. Chiang's agent Wu Anguo (former propaganda section chief of the Hailong Kuomintang County Party Department) was also arrested. Chiang's agent Wang Wenting (secretary of the Kuomintang Shanchengzhen District Party Department) attempted to blend into the stretcher team and pretend to be a commoner, but was immediately exposed by the masses. Many firearms hidden by the puppet police were seized with the exposure of the citizens.

　　辽西我军收复辽源
  　辽东解放东丰歼敌一团
    【新华社东北前线二十五日急电】东北民主联军一部，于昨（二十四）日收复辽西重要城市郑家屯（即辽源）。该城系四（平）洮（南）、四（平）通（辽）铁路联络点，为蒋杜军重要兵站基地之一。去年五月二十三日，蒋军七十一军侵占该城，作为“蚕食”辽西解放区及内蒙地区之跳板，已达一年。民主联军继二十一日收复该城以北之卧虎屯后，即将其包围。守敌七十一军八十七师一六○团残部两个营，于二十四日弃城南窜途中，全部被歼于八面城东北之喇嘛甸子，郑家屯即于当日收复。蒋军八十七师残部另一个营，则正在该城车站被围歼中。
    【新华社辽东前线二十五日急电】东北民主联军一部，今（二十五日）晨六时收复梅（河口）四（平）线上之东丰县城，歼灭蒋杜青年军第二师一个团。战斗开始于昨（二十四日）晚六时，经竟夜激战，迄今晨六时，守敌全部就歼。东丰收复后，四梅线已被截断，海龙、梅河口两处守敌，陷于孤立。按：东丰系于去年五月二十三日被蒋新六军及五十二军侵陷，迄今恰为一年。
    【新华社东北前线廿六日电】东北民主联军于本月十八至廿一日，在长春外围作战中，据初步统计：俘蒋军官兵四百零四名（内尉级军官十二名），缴获步枪二百二十二支，轻重机枪十五挺，卡宾式机枪十二挺，汤姆式机枪十六挺，汽车一辆（另击毁三辆），汽油五万四千余斤，降落伞廿六具，弹药五万四千余发，其他军用品一部。破坏机场仓库二处，毁碉堡七座。
    【新华社东北前线廿六日电】东北民主联军某部，廿五日晨在四平东北十余里之杨木林子击落临空肆虐美制蒋机一架，该机坠落于杨木林子附近之小桥子，人机俱焚。去年四平战役中，亦曾于该地首创击落蒋机之纪录。
    【新华社辽东廿四日电】本社随军记者报导：十三日我军开始向沈（阳）吉（林）中段之山城镇攻击时，枪声一响，市民即不顾危险，站在楼上盼着我军早早进城。翌日拂晓，我军进街，就急忙跑出来领着我军把东门里强固堡垒里最后顽抗的守敌歼灭。当我大军胜利进街时，居民拥集街头欢迎。商人们商议着怎样慰劳民主联军。蒋记警察所里关着的卅几位无辜人民，得到了解放，他们绝大多数是反抗蒋军抓丁抢粮的。一位被解放的白发老汉，连声感叹道：“八路可来了，八路可来了、想望着的救星可来了！”在枪声刚落之际，有的买卖人家即开市营业。市民恨透了那些封锁他们的蒋军工事，自动起来拆毁。天黑以前，遍布在七八里长大街上的百余座碉堡和铁丝网，就一扫而光了。在群众的协助下，趁战时混乱隐藏和潜逃的蒋记特务，当天就有许多落网。蒋特吴安国（前任海龙国民党县党部宣传科长）亦被捉住。蒋特王文亭（国民党山城镇区党部书记），企图混在担架队里假装老百姓，立刻为群众检举出来。许多伪警私藏的枪支，在市民的揭发下，被收缴了。
