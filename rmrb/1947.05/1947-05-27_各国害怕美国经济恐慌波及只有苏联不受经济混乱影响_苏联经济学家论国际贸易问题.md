Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, May 25th: TASS reports: Prominent Soviet economist Vishnev recently published a lengthy article in Izvestia entitled "On Post-War International Trade Issues." Vishnev first pointed out the significant differences between post-war and pre-war international trade in terms of nature, total volume, and direction: (1) Britain, the United States, and Canada seized Germany's markets after the war, with their exports accounting for nearly 50% of the world's total, compared to no more than 30% before the war. (2) Eastern European countries have developed mutual trade relations after the war and expanded their economic relations with the Soviet Union. (3) Post-war international trade is unbalanced, with the Eurasian continent urgently needing to import but having few export opportunities. For example, last year, the United States' exports were more than twice its imports, while France's imports were two and a half times its exports. (4) To continuously export goods, the United States must continuously and cyclically provide loans to poor purchasing countries, but this cycle cannot last long. (5) Excluding abnormal and temporary factors, the total volume of international trade is still far behind pre-war levels. Vishnev continued: The difficulties encountered in rebuilding world trade have further stimulated attempts to establish agreements on methods and approaches for developing international trade. Therefore, the attention of capitalist countries' governments and businesses to the seventeen-nation international trade conference held in Geneva on April 10th is quite natural. The United States is the initiator and main participant of this conference, and its official purpose is to remove the "barriers" it encounters in international trade, primarily by reducing tariffs and eliminating preferential systems. The United States insists on its famous "open door" policy and "equal opportunity" doctrine. The expansionist nature of these doctrines has been exposed by Molotov at the Paris Peace Conference. U.S. representatives constantly declare that, on a reciprocal basis, the United States will reduce its tariffs in revenue, but no concrete "concessions" from them in this regard have been heard to date. Indeed, this is not surprising, because there is no and cannot be a consensus among important U.S. entrepreneurs on the tariff issue. If the monopoly groups engaged in exporting goods favor lowering tariffs, the extremely powerful groups whose interests lie in maintaining high domestic prices resolutely oppose revising tariff rates. Therefore, Britain has also not expressed any desire to abolish the imperial preference system. U.S. representatives themselves admit that Britain cannot abolish the imperial preference system in its current economic situation. They point out that the U.S. loans to Britain are intended to weaken Britain's imperial preference system, not to completely and immediately abolish it. This policy of certain U.S. monopoly groups indicates an attempt to conclude a secret agreement with Britain at the expense of other countries in the world. And some other countries are precisely viewing the Geneva negotiations in this way. However, the attempt to force other countries to accept resolutions favorable to Anglo-American capital has encountered very strong resistance. For example, France demanded recognition of France's preferential rights over French colonies and insisted on special consideration for the situation of countries affected by the war. The Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg defended their own interests at the conference and have already signed and ratified customs unions during the conference to strengthen their positions. The existence of deep economic contradictions between Britain and the United States and the resistance of other countries to Anglo-American demands have made the atmosphere of the Geneva trade negotiations very tense. This tension has been further increased by the adoption of secret procedures for all proposals regarding tariff revisions. Vishnev concluded by pointing out that the Geneva Conference is not the only meeting on international trade. The recent London Wheat Conference has stalled, and other conferences on the most important commodities, such as kerosene, cotton, and rubber, have either been held or are about to be held. The typical characteristic of all economic conferences between capitalist countries is the fear of economic panic, especially U.S. economic panic. The shadow of this future economic panic has already enveloped international economic and political relations. It is not surprising that many countries' sober-minded entrepreneurs do not let themselves be deceived by the temporary brilliance of U.S. prosperity. When discussing the issue of international trade development, they refuse to ignore the great Soviet Union, a country that does not know panic and is not affected by the severe economic chaos of the United States.

  　苏联经济学家论国际贸易问题
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】据塔斯社讯：苏联著名经济学家维什涅夫顷在消息报发表长篇论文——《论战后国际贸易问题》。维什涅夫首先指出战后与战前的国际贸易在性质、总额与方向上均极不相同的事实：（一）英、美、加在战后攫取了德国的市场，其出口额几占全世界百分之五十，而战前并未超过百分之三十。（二）东欧各国在战后发展相互间的贸易关系，并扩大与苏联的经济关系。（三）战后国际贸易的不平衡性，欧亚大陆急需进口，但极少出口的机会。如去年美国出口为进口的两倍多，而法国进口则为出口的两倍半。（四）为了不断输出货物，美国必须不断循环地对贫穷的购买国贷款，但这种循环是不能长久的。（五）除去非正常的和暂时的因素，国际贸易总额仍大大地落后于战前水平。维什涅夫继称：在重建世界贸易中所遭遇的困难对成立关于发展国际贸易的办法和途径之协议的企图，更增加了刺激。因此资本主义国家的政府和企业界对四月十日在日内瓦召开的十七国国际贸易会议之注意是十分自然的。美国是该会的发起者和主要参加者，她的官方目的在于除去她在国际贸易中碰着的“壁垒”，首先在于减低关税和取消特惠制度。美国坚持她的著名的“门户开放”政策与“机会均等”主义。这些主义的扩张性质，已为莫洛托夫在巴黎和会上所揭露。美国代表不断地宣称：在互惠的基础上，美国将在岁收中减低其关税，然而任何关于他们在这方面的具体“让步”，至今仍未听见。的确，这并不令人惊奇。因为在美国她自己的重要企业家关于关税问题，没有也不能有一致的。如果经营出口的垄断集团赞成降低关税，利益系于维持国内高物价的极有力的集团就坚决反对修改关税税率；因此英国也没有表示任何废除帝国特惠制度的愿望。美国代表自己承认，英国在现在经济情况下不能废除帝国特惠制度。他们指出，美国贷款给英国，是要削弱英国的帝国特惠制度，而不是要完全和立刻废掉它。美国某些垄断集团的这种政策，表示出一种想与英国缔结密约，牺牲世界各国的企图。而且某些其他国家也正是这样看日内瓦的商谈的。但是强迫别国接受于英美资本有利之决议的企图，遇到了十分强有力的反抗。例如法国要求承认法国对法国殖民地的特惠权，并坚持特别考虑受战争影响之各国的情况。荷兰、比利时和卢森堡在会议上为他们自己的利益辩护，而且已经在会议期间签订并批准增强他们地位的关税同盟。英美间深刻经济矛盾的存在和其他国家对英美要求的反抗，使日内瓦贸易商谈的气氛非常紧张。由于对所有的关于修改关税提议采用秘密程序，这种紧张就更增加了。维什涅夫在结论中指出：日内瓦会议不是国际贸易唯一的会议。最近伦敦麦田会议搁浅了，其他关于最重要物品如煤油、棉花、橡皮的会议也或已举行过或即正在举行。资本主义国家间的一切经济会议之典型特点就是对经济恐慌首先是美国经济恐慌的恐惧。这种未来经济恐慌的阴影，已经笼罩着国际经济和政治的关系上了。许多国家清醒的企业家不让他们自己迷惑于美国繁荣的暂时灿烂，这是不奇怪的。在讨论国际贸易发展的问题时，他们拒绝忽视伟大的苏联，这个国家不知道恐慌而且不受美国剧烈经济混乱的影响。
