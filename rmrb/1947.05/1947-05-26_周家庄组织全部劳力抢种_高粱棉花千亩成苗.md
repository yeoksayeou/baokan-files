　　周家庄组织全部劳力抢种
  　高粱棉花千亩成苗
    【本报冀南二十四日电】南宫四区周家庄出征担架队出发后，农会代表周长贵等村干部领导组织群众留在家中的劳动力大部完成抢种。人力组织办法：一、剩下的民兵负责给出征队员打水。二、剩下的自卫队员分工给军属和出征的担架队员代耕。三、军属和担架队员家中仍有劳动力者则不代耕。牛力组织办法：一、军属家喂牛者只耕种自己地而不代耕，两家伙喂者半个牛力代耕。二、全村有牛卅二头，平均每头代耕地七亩，牛的力量大小不同，酌情增减。三、军属秋收后不买牛者，收的草帮助代耕户一部分，全村共地十九顷七十亩，麦地四顷多，秋地已播种的高粱、棉花、瓜共十顷，都已成苗，剩下的五顷，正在播种谷子、花生。
