　　Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 23rd. According to the Qingdao Military and Civilian Daily of May 2nd: US Ambassador Stuart arrived in Qingdao on the 1st, and the next day gave a speech at Shandong University. The student union of the university posted slogans including: "Don't lose the deep friendship of China's 400 million people," and "We thirst for genuine friendship and peace." In his speech, Stuart praised the Chiang Kai-shek party's pseudo-constitution, instructing students with the tone of an owner, "Prepare to be good citizens." After the speech, student representatives presented the US Ambassador with a letter stating: "We, as Chinese university students, would like to make two requests to the Ambassador: (1) Your country's troops were originally stationed in various parts of China to accept surrenders and repatriate prisoners. Now that this mission is completed, there is still no deadline for the withdrawal of these troops. Our original school buildings are also occupied by your country's troops and have not been returned. The current school buildings are insufficient, and the problem is extremely serious. We sincerely hope that you will convey to your government the return of our school buildings, so as to avoid undermining our country's education. (2) When your troops are stationed in China, they inflict atrocities on our people. In Qingdao alone, your country's troops frequently insult residents, and those who are killed or injured by trucks are even more frequent. All sectors are indignant. We sincerely hope that the Ambassador will inform your country's authorities to strictly restrain the illegal acts of subordinates, promptly and severely punish the murderers, provide consolation to the families of the deceased, compensate for all losses, and guarantee that the same incidents will not happen again in the future. For the sake of national dignity and the lives of the people, our school's students find it difficult to remain silent." After reading the letter, Stuart had nothing to say and left quietly. According to Qingdao newspapers: When US Navy Seventh Fleet Commander Admiral Cooke held a press conference on the 7th, he said barbarously regarding the Shandong University students' request to vacate the school buildings: "The world is currently experiencing a housing shortage. The US military needs housing in Qingdao and cannot give it up!"
　　Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 23rd. Traffic accidents caused by US military trucks stationed in Qingdao occur frequently. According to the Chiang Kai-shek police bureau in Qingdao, in April alone, there were eleven traffic accidents caused by US trucks, plus six accidents caused by Chiang's troops, resulting in 31 civilian casualties. On May 1st, another US military truck ran over and killed the five-year-old child of citizen Liu Gongxin at the Huantai Road intersection. After the accident, the truck sped away. Liu Gongxin and his wife were over forty years old and had only this one child. Upon hearing the news, they rushed to the scene, embraced the corpse, and wailed in grief, causing passers-by to weep in sorrow and indignation. Afterwards, the Chiang Kai-shek government, as usual, examined the body and ordered its burial. As usual, the US military's atrocities were handled by the US side investigating the offending "driver" to perfunctorily close the case.

　　山大学生致书司徒抗议美军强驻中国
    【新华社山东廿三日电】据五月二日青岛军民日报透露：美大使司徒雷登一日抵青岛，翌日赴山东大学演讲，该校学生自治会张贴标语中有：“不要失掉中国四万万人民的深厚友谊”，及“我们渴求真正的友谊与和平”等语。司徒演讲中对蒋党伪宪备加赞扬，俨然以主人翁口吻训示学生“准备做良好公民”。演讲毕，学生代表当面递致美大使书内称：“我们愿以中国大学生的身份，向大使提出两点要求：（一）贵国军队原为受降遣俘留驻中国各地，现今任务既已完毕，此项驻军仍无撤退期限。敝校原有校舍亦为贵国军队占驻，迄未归还，现校舍不敷应用，问题极为严重。深望阁下转达贵政府让出敝校校舍，庶免摧残我国教育之嫌。（二）贵军队留驻中国时，以暴行加之我人民，以青岛一地而言，贵国驻军时常侮辱居民，而遭卡车之毙伤者尤屡见不鲜，各界莫不愤慨。深望大使转告贵国当局，严格约束所属不法行为，从速严惩凶手，抚恤死难家属，赔偿一切损失，并保证今后不发生同样事件。敝校同学为争取国格及民命计，实难隐忍不言”。司徒读信后，无辞可答，悄然而去。另据青岛各报载：美海军第七舰队司令柯克上将七日举行记者招待会时，关于山大学生要求让出校舍问题竟蛮横的说：“目前世界都闹房荒，美军在青岛需住房，不能让出！”
    【新华社山东廿三日电】驻青岛美军卡车肇事案件迭出。据青市蒋记警察局宣布，仅四月份美卡车肇事即有十一次，连同蒋军肇事六次，计伤亡市民达卅一名。五月一日又有美军大卡车一辆，在桓台路口轧死市民刘公信之五岁幼童，该卡车肇祸后急驰而去，刘公信夫妻年逾四十，只此一子，闻讯赶来，抚尸嚎啕痛哭，路人莫不痛愤落泪。事后蒋记政府照例验尸，勤令掩埋，对美军暴行亦照例由美方究查肇事“司机”敷衍结案。
