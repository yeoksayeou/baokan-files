　　Inspiring Class Consciousness and Production Consciousness Among Village Cadres
    Changzhi Fourth District Commends and Models
    [This newspaper Changzhi News] After the Changzhi Fourth District held a production mobilization meeting of more than 1,200 people in the whole district on the 17th of last month, in addition to 27 villages organizing production mutual aid groups, there were still 12 villages where production was spontaneous, with each village mostly looking after itself, or only having one or two mutual aid groups. The reasons for the inspection were that the masses reflected that the cadres did not talk about organizing mutual aid, and they never held meetings. And some village cadres had a rest, saying that being a cadre would not end well. Another problem was the combination of agriculture and coal and iron industries. There were many handicraft workers in the Fourth District, and blacksmithing could earn two dou of rice a day, so they couldn't take care of the land. Farmers felt that mutual aid with workers was not profitable, so it was better for farmers to help each other, so they could go down the mountain to transport goods and earn money as soon as they finished their land. The former problem was a problem left over from the solidarity movement. At that time, some cadres were affected by the fact that the masses raised many shortcomings and few praises, and individual cadres were hit hard, which affected their emotions. The latter problem is the problem of labor exchange and mutual assistance between farmers and workers. According to the above situation, the district cadres' meeting believed that in order to strengthen production leadership and carry out mass production movements, we should start with commending and modeling, mobilize cadres ideologically, and solve the combination of agriculture, coal, and iron industries. Therefore, a village cadre meeting of more than 200 people was held in the base village to solve ideological problems and deeply mobilize production. The method was to release frustration by commending and modeling, from class consciousness to production consciousness, and mobilize cadres. At the meeting, many village cadres actively spoke, saying: "Democracy is really difficult. If you say it lightly, they won't care. If you say it heavily, they will object. From the anti-traitor and rent reduction to the filling and compensation movement, they work day and night, and the masses can earn money, but we can't. We can't even share more of the fruits. Cadres are 'cadres'. When work gets busy, they don't even have time to carry water for their families, and they still have to suffer from their wives." "The first three years of revolution, the next three years are fatal, this is the end." "The political director of Zhao Family Village served as a Eighth Route Army soldier for eight years, and when he returned home and became the political director, he said the method was simple, and he shouldn't have been struggled against and dismissed!" "The instructor of Xizhang Village organized the masses to transport goods, and earned 400,000 yuan from 12,000 yuan of shares. When sharing the fruits, he was evaluated and given five rooms, but he thought it was too much and returned three rooms to let the masses turn over. However, the object of struggle, as the cooperative accountant, insisted that the instructor had embezzled 1,000 yuan of shares. He felt very wronged. Although district cadres and the masses checked and found that he had not embezzled, the superiors did not support him." "Cadres all say that it's better to not show off if you're good, and if you're bad, everyone knows." "It's easy to be a member of the masses, but it's difficult to be a cadre. Being a cadre suffers from four kinds of anger (wife's anger, military family's anger, masses' anger, superior's anger), and in the end there's no good end. Who has the mood to organize production? Let's take a break and let others do it! Black and white clothes are worn in turns, let others do it and we'll watch." The opinions on district cadres are: 1. They don't specifically help to think of ways, they don't care enough for village cadres, and they can't solve specific difficulties. 2. A new emperor has new subjects, and a general has a new life. For example, the cadres of Sangzi Village are not united, and three district cadres have been replaced to work, each with a different approach, each with a different faction, attacking one faction and raising another. 3. At the meeting, they only said to work hard, but no one cares when problems arise. Village cadres are like children without mothers, only used but not educated. 4. Few rewards, many criticisms, only able to criticize people, and have a lot of complaints.
    After the village cadres released their frustration and complaints, the district cadres commended the village cadres' merits from the leadership, and also made self-criticism. Shen Zhouxun and Niu Laiquan of the sub-committee criticized: "I listened to one side of the story and detained the cadres of Guan Family Village for one night. I did not investigate and study and attacked the cadres. This is my fault. I did not help my comrades enough, praised less, criticized more, and often criticized my comrades. This is a problem with my work style, and I must pay attention to correcting it in the future." Then they raised the question of how to solve these problems. The conclusion was that cadres who have made contributions, even if their work style is not good, this is an education problem and should not be struggled against and attacked. The two political directors, one village chief, one instructor, and one farmers' association chairman who were dismissed were reappointed as cadres. As for the special agents who provoked the relationship between cadres and the masses, such as the special agents in Beidazhang and Xizhang villages, who stole the letters given by the district to the political director and did not give them, and secretly encouraged the attack on cadres, they should be dealt with. After the problem was solved, the cadres' emotions turned around, and they all said that they had released their anger, and it was easy to endure hardship and suffering. After the district cadres criticized themselves and solved specific problems, the village chief of Qiaotou Village said: "District cadres have problems, but we are even more powerful than district cadres. I didn't do a good job in organizing women in my village, so I scolded them. Some people performed poorly in the mutual aid group, and I deducted their pay. These are all things that separate us from the masses. Don't blame the masses for raising opinions to us." The cadres of Xijiu said: "This time you have praised us, and we must be more conscious in the future and not separate ourselves from the masses." Shi Tushan, the political director of Ximanzhang, said: "If we are passive, who will be active? The landlords used to exploit us and make us poor. We have just turned over and established a foundation. If we want to rest and not work, it is equivalent to giving the weapon to others and letting the landlords press us with stones again." Zhao Chenglai and others said: "We are not afraid of difficulties in the revolution, and we must carry it out to the end. After leading the masses to turn over, we must also lead the masses to cut off the roots of wealth. If the masses become rich, we will also become rich, adding merit to merit, and shortcomings must be corrected." Finally, the village cadres told the district cadres: We have held this meeting, and we will work hard when we go back, follow the mass line, and are determined to transform our work style.
    Regarding the remaining problems of fruit distribution, such as Sangzi Village changing more than ten acres of land that had already been announced, and many pieces of furniture that had not been distributed, and Yincheng also having more than 100,000 yuan that had not been distributed, the land problem also needs to be solved urgently, and the fruits must be completely divided and not left behind. In the new district's mutual assistance, due to the excessive "tolerance" last year, it was believed that all the farmers in the world were one family, and some wages were not settled. For example, the masses in villages such as ShitanYu said that mutual assistance is good, but they have done more work and have not received wages.
    The above problems also involve the relationship between some cadres and the masses. Some cadres have opinions with a few of the masses, and some have opinions with the majority of the masses. The solution discussed is to organize a large number of people. If a small number of people have opinions, the cadres should take the initiative to untie the knot in the mutual aid group during the time of working on the land. If the majority have opinions, they should be brewed during the day in the mutual aid organization, and cadres should also be commended. At night, they should be resolved in the farmers' association, and special agents and objects of struggle should not participate. The unfair distribution of fruits is a minority, individual case. We should adopt the method of adjusting and solving the problem as soon as possible. Villages with more problems on the avenue should adopt the method of political cadres taking turns on duty. For example, in Xijiu Town, one cadre is near the village's fields every day to help each other in production. If something happens, children can call them, which is very convenient. District cadres try not to delay the village cadres' daytime production time, and adopt the method of meeting and discussing at night. + Regarding the issue of combining coal and iron industries with agriculture, because there are more than 7,000 workers in the Fourth District, their income accounts for more than 50% of agriculture. For example, in Nandazhang Village, there are more than 900 acres of land, and the land is not very good. It can harvest 1,154 shi of coarse grains every year. The industrial income is calculated in six months, and each worker earns an average of two dou of rice per day, which can earn 3,672 shi. If this problem is not properly solved, it will be difficult to achieve "cultivating for three years and having one year to spare." According to existing experience, there are the following types: The three mutual aid groups in Zhang Qilou Team in Henghe, with 23 households, have eight worker households. The workers contributed 400,000 yuan and bought six livestock, and exchanged labor with the farmers. After planting, the farmers transported goods, and the farmers received 80% or 70% of the profit, and the workers received 20% or 30% of the profit. The farmers gave land cultivation in exchange for equal value, and the workers did not stop working, so that both workers and farmers benefited. Another method is that there are many workers and few farmers in Nandazhang. Their method is: 1. Organize a large number of women to raise auxiliary labor. More than 50 people have now been organized. They can repair field edges, break up clods, plow the ground, pull seedlings, hoe corn, and plant corn. 2. Organize labor-capital cooperatives. In the past, 98 workers had to send one person to Yincheng to buy raw materials and promote goods every three days. With the cooperative, 98 workers can be saved every three days. The cooperative has seven people, and they don't earn money by buying raw materials and promoting goods. Everyone provides for their living problems. 3. Workers buy a large number of livestock to solve the problem of animal power. Sixteen heads have now been purchased. During the busy farming season, workers get up early and work late to do heavy work on the land, and semi-laborers are responsible for light work. This way, they can not only avoid delaying planting, but also do more blacksmithing.

　　启发村干阶级自觉与生产自觉
    长治四区表功表模
    【本报长治讯】长治四区从上月十七号全区开了一千二百余人的生产动员会后，三十九个行政村，除二十七个村组织起生产互助组外，还有十二个村生产是自流的，各顾各的多，或只有一二个互助组。检查原因，群众反映是，干部不说组织互助，也一直不开会。而村干部则有歇歇思想，说是当干部终究落不下个好下场。再一种是农业与煤、铁业的结合问题，四区手工业工人多，打铁一天能赚二斗米，顾不上上地，农民觉得和工人互助没利，不如光农民互助，早做完地就可下山运输去赚钱。前一个问题是团结运动中遗留下了的问题，当时有些干部因群众提自己的缺点多，表功少，个别干部受了些打击，影响情绪。后一个问题是农民与工人的变工互助问题。根据以上情况，区干部会议上认为要加强生产领导，开展群众生产运动，应从表功、表模入手，从思想上把干部发动起来，同时要解决农业、煤、铁业结合问题。于是在基点村开了二百余人的村干部会议，解决思想问题，深入动员生产。在方法上是，表功、表模出闷气，从阶级自觉到生产自觉，把干部调动起来。会上许多村干积极发言说：“民主真难，说的轻了不尿，重了反对，从反奸减租到填平补齐翻身运动中，没明搭夜的工作，群众能赚钱咱不能，分果实还不能多分，干部是‘干部’，工作忙起来连水也顾不上给家担，还得受老婆气。”“前三年革命，后三年要命，这就是下场。”“赵家庄政治主任当过八年八路军，退伍回来当上政治主任，就说方式简单，也不该斗争撤职呀！”“西掌村指导员组织群众运输，由一万二千元股金赚到四十万元，分果实时评议给分了五间房，自己以为太多，退出三间叫群众也翻身。可是斗争对象当合作社会计，一口咬定指导员贪污股金一千元，他感到很冤屈，虽经区干部和群众检查，他没有贪污行为，但上级也不给做个主。”“干部都说有好不显，有坏一片。”“群众好当，干部难当，当干部受的四种气（老婆气、军属气、群众气、上级气），终究没下场，谁还有心情组织生产，咱歇一歇，叫别人当吧！黑白布衫轮流穿，叫别人干咱看看。”对区干部的意见是：一、不具体帮助想办法，对村干部爱护不够，不能解决具体困难。二、一朝天子一朝臣，一个将军一道命，如桑梓村干部不团结，换了三个区干部去工作，一人一样，一人一派，打击一派，抬高一派。三、开会光说好好干工作，出了问题没人管，村干部好比没娘孩，光使用不教育。四、奖励少，批评多，光能碰人，发了很多牢骚。
    村干部出了闷气发了牢骚以后，区干部从领导上表了村干部的功，又做了自我检讨。分委申周勋、牛来全检讨说：“我听了一面话，把关家干部扣了一夜，不调查研究打击了干部，这是我的不对。对同志帮助不够，表扬少，批评多，并常碰同志，这是我的作风问题，今后须注意改正。”接着提出讨论这些问题怎样解决，结论是对有功的干部，虽作风不好，但这是教育问题，不应斗争打击。撤了职的两个政治主任、一个村长、一个指导员、一个农会主席，重新担任干部。对挑拨干群关系的特务分子，如北大掌、西掌村特务分子，把区上给政治主任的信都偷了不给，暗地鼓动打击干部，则应加以处理。问题解决后，干部情绪转过来了，都说这口气出上来了，吃苦受罪都好办。区干部检讨及解决具体问题后，桥头村长说：“区干部有毛病，咱比区干部更厉害，我村妇女组织没搞好，我就骂人家，有人在互助组里表现不好，我还扣人家，这都是脱离群众的事情，不怨群众给咱提意见。”西久干部说：“这次抬高咱了，今后得自觉些，不要脱离群众。”西蛮掌政治主任石土山等说：“咱们消极了叫谁积极呢？地主过去把咱剥削穷了，才刚翻了身扎下个根，想歇歇不干了，等于把武器给了人家，让地主再给身上压上石板。”赵成来等人说：“革命不怕困难，一定要革到底，领导群众翻身了，还要领导群众裁富根，群众发财，咱也发财，功上加功，缺点要改正。”最后，村干告区干部说：我们这次开了会，回去要好好工作，要走群众路线，决心改造作风。
    关于果实分配的遗留问题，如桑梓村将已公布了的土地，随便更动了十余亩，还有好多家具未分完，荫城也有十余万块钱未分，土地问题也急待解决，要彻底分清果实不留一点。新区互助，由于去年有过分的“涵厚”认为天下农民是一家，有的工资没有清算，如石炭峪等村群众说，互助起来是好，就是多做了工，没有得上工资来。
    以上问题里边也存在一些干部与群众关系问题，有的干部是与少数群众有意见，有的是与多数群众有意见。讨论出的解决方法，是大量组织起来，少数人有意见的，干部要主动的在互助组里上地休息时间解开疙瘩，多数有意见的，白天通过互助组织上地酝酿，也要给干部表功，黑夜在农会里解决，特务斗争对象不能参加。果实问题分配不公的，是少数的，个别的，采取越快越好调剂解决办法，大道边事情多的村采取政权干部轮值日办法，如西久镇每天一个干部在村附近地里互助生产，有了事情儿童去叫，也很方便，区干部尽量不耽误村干部白天生产时间，采取黑夜接头商议的办法。＋    关于煤、铁业与农业结合的问题，因四区有七千多工人，收入占农业百分之五十以上，如南大掌全村有九百多亩地，地也不很好，每年能收粗粮一千一百五十四石，工业收入以六个月计算，每个工人每天平均赚到二斗米，可赚三千六百七十二石，这个问题如不适当解决，耕三余一就难达到。根据现有的经验，有以下几种：横河张起楼队三个互助小组，廿三户有八户工人，工人出钱四十万元，买了六个牲口，与农民变工，下种完农民运输，赚上钱农八或七，工二或三分红，农民给种地等价交换计工，工人不停业，这样工农两利，再一种是南大掌工人多，农民少，他的办法是：一、大量组织妇女筹辅助劳力，现已组织起五十多个人，她们是修地边，打圪垃，刨地拔苗，锄玉茭，栽玉茭等都可以。二、组织劳资合作社，过去九十八个工人，三天就得误上一个人到荫城买原料，推销货，有了合作社，三天就能省九十八个工，合作社有七个人，买原料推销货不赚钱，生活问题大家供给。三、工人大量买牲口，解决畜力问题，现已买到十六头，农忙时工人起早搭黑上地做重活，轻活由半劳力负责，这样既不误种地，又能多打铁。
