Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th. According to TASS, London: Five local branches of the British Labour Party have instructed their representatives attending the Labour Party's annual conference to request the Rules Committee to allow an emergency proposal to be made regarding the US policy towards Greece and Turkey. The full text of the proposal is as follows: "This conference notes that Truman's decision to provide military and economic assistance to Greece and Turkey was not consulted with Britain in its planning and disregards the obligations of the United Nations Charter. This conference firmly believes that the means and aims of this policy constitute a threat to world peace and violate democratic principles. Huge sacrifices were made in the last war to maintain this principle. The conference believes that the US policy towards Turkey should be the subject of investigation under Article 34 of the United Nations Charter, as it is engaged in creating international conflict. The conference urges the government to propose to the Security Council that aid to Greece should only be given in accordance with the plans formulated by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, and that Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union should jointly assist the Greek people in establishing democracy and eliminating fascism, as the three powers did in Tehran and Yalta. Finally, the conference demands that British police, military delegations, and stationed troops immediately withdraw from Greece. If the Rules Committee accepts this proposal, Mr. Juliusz Katz-Suchy will present it at the meeting." The initiators of the emergency proposal pointed out that Truman's decision to intervene in Greece and Turkey is an event of historical importance, profoundly affecting Britain's position and policy, and the situation in the world.

　　英国工党五个支部反对美“援”希土
    【新华社陕北廿五日电】据塔斯社伦敦讯：英国工党五个地方支部，已命令他们出席工党年会的代表请求程序规则委员会允许为美国对希土政策提出紧急提案。提案全文如下：“本大会注意到：杜鲁门对希、土军事及经济援助之决定，其计划并未与英国商议过，而且蔑视联合国宪章的义务。本大会坚信：此项政策之手段与目的构成对世界和平之威胁，而且违反民主原则。为了保持这个原则，在上次大战中曾有巨大牺牲。大会相信：美国对土耳其的政策应为联合国宪章第三十四条进行调查的题目，因为它正从事于制造国际冲突。大会敦促政府向安理会提议，对希援助只应遵照联合国粮食与农业机构所拟定的计划给予，而英美苏应该联合协助希腊人民建立民主并清除法西斯，一如三强在德黑兰与雅尔塔所为者。最后，大会要求英国警察同军事代表团及留置之军队立即由希腊撤退。一如程序规则委员会接受这一提案，朱里亚卡斯将在会上提出。紧急提案之发起人指出：杜鲁门干涉希土的决定是有历史重要性的事件，深切的影响到英国的地位与政策及全世界之情势。
