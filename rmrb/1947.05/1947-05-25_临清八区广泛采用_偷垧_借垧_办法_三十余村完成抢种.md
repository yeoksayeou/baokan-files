The People’s Daily Jinnan, 23rd Dispatch: The northern thirty-odd villages in the Eighth District of Linqing have promoted the methods of "stealing a mu" and "borrowing a mu," and all the land has been planted in time. Dongwangzhuang planted over a thousand mu of cotton, and all other crops have been planted. This method was created by Wang Yuanshan of Dongwangzhuang. In the 25th year of the Republic of China (1936), there was a drought, and the area around Xiabao Temple failed to plant cotton seedlings, but Wang Yuanshan's village had full cotton seedlings. In the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938), there was another drought, and Zhangcun carried a seed drill to learn the method. Thus, the "stealing a mu" and "borrowing a mu" methods spread throughout the district. "Stealing a mu" is when, under extremely drought conditions, one first deeply furrows the land, planting the seeds deeply in the moist soil or shaded, moist soil, then rolling it well. When the cotton seeds have taken root, then a seed drill is used to turn the furrows into small ditches. When turning, two bundles of dry grass are tied to the legs of the drill. If the cotton seeds are four fingers deep, the grass under the drill leg should leave three fingers' height. The grass bundles should be tied firmly, in a fan shape, small in the front and large in the back, so as to separate the soil. After the small ditches are formed, the cotton seeds are very shallow from the ground, and can come out in two days. When separating the soil for the second time, do not roll it again. This way, the furrows are deep, storing water when it rains, and the small seedlings are easily vigorous. As they gradually grow, the furrows are banked up when hoeing the ground, the roots are deep and the leaves are lush, and they are also top-dressed with manure. When planting millet and sorghum, just bury them deeply in the furrows, roll them well, and they can come out without separating the soil. "Borrowing a mu" is when the drought is not very serious, whether planting cotton or sorghum, a bundle of grass or a shoe sole is tied to the leg of the drill to separate a layer of dry soil. After it dries slightly, it is then rolled. Wang Yuanshan said: "In the 26th year of Guangxu (1900), I planted ninety-five mu of sorghum, which saved my life; others delayed planting until it rained on the tenth day of the seventh month, and before the grain could ripen, there was frost. You must understand the solar terms and not let people down!"

The People’s Daily Jinnan, 23rd Dispatch: Ganji Town, Weixian County, has successfully completed the rush planting work in Pangsu Village. The entire town of Ganji launched a male-female labor emulation campaign. For seven days of mutual aid assaults, a total of more than two thousand mu of millet, cotton, etc., were planted. The village cadres of Pangsu Village guided the masses to recall the great famine of 1943 and overcome the idea of relying on heaven for food. The entire village, men, women, old and young, were mobilized to carry out rush planting, and the sixteen qing of land were quickly planted. The sorghum and soybeans have already emerged and hoeing has begun.

　　临清八区广泛采用“偷垧”“借垧”办法
    三十余村完成抢种
    【本报冀南二十三日电】临清八区北部三十余村，推广“偷垧”“借垧”办法，所有土地全部抢种完毕。东王庄抢种棉花千余亩，其他庄稼全部种上。这办法是东王庄王元善创造的，民国二十五年天旱，下堡寺一带都未耩上花苗，王元善村棉花却出得满苗。民国二十七年天又旱，张村扛耧来学办法，于是“偷垧”“借垧”办法传遍全区。“偷垧”是在异常天旱情况下，先深深摸垧，把籽深深耩在湿土或阴湿土上，随后砘好，到棉籽抓住地扎出根，然后再用耧将垄挑成小沟。挑时在两耧腿上绑好两个干草把，如花籽深四指，草把下耧脚可留三指高，草把要绑结实，呈扇面形，前小后大，以便分土。挑成小沟后，棉籽离地面很浅，两天便可出来。第二次分土时，不要再砘，这样垄深，下雨存水，小苗容易旺，逐渐大了，随锄地将垄淤起，根深叶茂，还顶上粪。耩谷子、高粱只要深深埋到垧上，砘好不用分土就可出来。“借垧”是在天旱不很严重时，不管耩棉花、高粱在耧腿上绑个草把或鞋底，将干土分去一层，稍干后再砘。王元善说：“光绪二十六年，我种九十五亩高粱，保活了命；别人推延到七月初十下了雨才耩，没结上粮食就来了霜，必须明白节气不让人呀！”
    【本报冀南二十三日电】威县干集镇，庞苏庄抢种工作胜利完成。干集全镇男女结合立功运动，进行了七天互助突击，共抢种谷子、棉花等两千余亩。庞苏庄村干部引导群众回想三十二年大灾荒，克服了靠天吃饭的想法。全村男女老少总动员实行抢种，十六顷地很快抢种完毕，高粱黄豆都已出苗开锄。
