Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, May 15th (Delayed): TASS, Rome—The attempt to provoke a government crisis in Italy over the past few days has been exposed. Reactionaries and newspapers are engaging in all activities to exacerbate the crisis within the Christian Democratic Party in order to provoke a government crisis. Following Christian Democratic Party member Campilli's assumption of the post of Minister of Finance, the sharp deterioration of the national financial and economic situation, the endless inflation facing Italy, and the Christian Democratic Party's new failure in the Sicilian elections have stirred up shock and confusion within the party. The Christian Democratic Party's two hopeless attempts to cover up their responsibility for the current domestic economic deterioration and to reverse the alienation of all voters from them, combined with external pressure, have revived the so-called "expanded government" plan. When Bescali declared in a radio address on April 28 that "representatives of all interests and representatives of all economic ideas" could participate in the government, this suggestion was immediately picked up by relevant figures as a signal to provoke a government crisis. The Liberals, through their newspapers, declared that they would cooperate with the government on the condition of excluding the Communist Party. The Republicans hinted that they would not refuse the suggestion to participate in the government. Saragat then declared that his party was willing to give the new government support. The Republicans and Saragat sharply opposed the "three-party system," and they distortedly criticized this system in newspapers. At the Christian Democratic Party's national conference held in early May, right-wing leaders of the party openly argued in favor of a government crisis in order to "expel the Communists" from the government. The left wing of the party opposed any "government expansion" and attempts to incite a government crisis, saying that such a conspiracy could only further alienate all voters from the Christian Democratic Party. In a special communiqué issued on the 7th of this month, the leading organs of the Communist Party and the Socialist Party emphatically condemned any attempt to change the relationship of mutual cooperation forces in the coalition government, and demanded a solution to the implementation of the current government's plan in order to improve the country's financial and economic situation.

　　意反动派施苦肉计阴谋破坏联合政府
    【新华社陕北十五日电】塔斯社罗马讯（迟到）：过去数日，在意大利挑起政府危机之企图已被揭穿。反动分子与报纸正从事一切活动以加剧基督教民主党内部的危机来挑起政府危机。继基督教民主党党员坎皮利担任财政部长之职务后，国家财政与经济情势的急剧恶化，意大利所面临着的无止境的通货膨胀，以及基督教民主党在西西里选举中的新失败，已在该党内部激起了震惊与混乱。基督教民主党为要掩饰他们对目前国内经济恶化的责任，以及挽回全体选民对他们的疏远，这两个无望的企图和外来的压力相结合，已引起了所谓“扩大政府”计划的复活。当贝斯加利四月二十八日的广播演说中宣称：“一切利益的代表和一切经济观念的代表”可以参加政府的时候，此一示意立即被有关人物急忙捡起，作为起挑政府危机的信号。自由党人通过其报纸，宣称他们以排除共产党为与政府合作的条件。共和党人暗示他们并不谢绝参加政府的建议。萨拉盖特则宣称他的党愿意给新政府以支持。共和党人和萨拉盖特尖锐反对“三党制度”，他们在报纸上对此制度加以歪曲的批评。在五月初举行的基督教民主党全国会议上，该党右翼领袖公开争论着赞成政府危机以从政府“驱逐共产党人”。该党左翼则反对任何的“政府扩大”和煽起政府危机的企图。谓此种阴谋只能使全体选民与基督教民主党更加疏远。共产党与社会党的领导机关在本月七日发表的特别公报中，着重谴责对任何要变动联合政府中合作力量相互关系的企图，并要求解决实行目前政府的计划，以改进国家的财政和经济局势。
