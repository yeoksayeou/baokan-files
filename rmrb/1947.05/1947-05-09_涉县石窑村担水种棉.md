[Report from She County] The Feng Shuquan mutual aid group in Shiyao Village achieved the best results in crash planting. Because it didn't rain and the ground was dry and cracked, everyone carried water to plant cotton. The women soaked the cotton seeds at home, the young and strong carried water, the old men dug holes, and the children sowed the seeds. The next day it rained a little, and the Feng Shuquan group didn't even watch the opera performance in Suobao, and finished the crash planting in one go. Their group planted more than thirteen mu in total. Under their influence, the Shiyao and Haojia mutual aid groups were all vying to move forward. Jia Yingdi, leading seven women in Haojia Village, carried water to plant two and a half mu of cotton for military families in one day. The Feng Lanxiang mutual aid group in Shiyao Village sowed 30 mu of millet, and the cotton was planted in one or two days.

[Report from Zuoquan] After the county's production mobilization meeting, cadres in Bei'aipu fully led the planting starting on the 25th day of the second lunar month in order to cooperate with the front line's victory and complete spring plowing as soon as possible. Up to now, a total of 470 mu of millet, corn, and potatoes have been planted, and the crash campaign is still continuing. It is planned to complete all spring plowing in more than ten days.

　　涉县石窑村担水种棉
    【本报涉县讯】石窑村冯树全互助组，突击下种，成绩最好。天不下雨，地干崩崩的，大家便担水栽棉花，妇女在家泡棉种，青壮年担水，老汉刨圪道，儿童点籽儿。第二日又下了一些雨，冯堡树全组索堡唱戏都没瞧，一气突击完，他组共栽十三亩多。在他们的影响下，石窑、郝家互助组都争着往前赶。郝家村贾英弟领导七个妇女一天给军属担水栽花二亩半。石窑冯兰香互助组，撒谷三十亩，棉花一、二日即种完。
