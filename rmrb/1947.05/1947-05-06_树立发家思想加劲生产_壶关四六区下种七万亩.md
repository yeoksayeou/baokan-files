　　Establish a Mindset of Getting Rich and Step Up Production
    Huguan's Fourth and Sixth Districts Sowed 70,000 Mu
    [Report from this newspaper in Huguan] After the meetings of district and village cadres, various model heroes, and activists in Huguan's fourth and sixth districts, and after in-depth ideological mobilization, under the slogan of "The front and the rear undergo major change, fight both Lao Jiang and engage in production," a vigorous spring plowing and sowing campaign was launched. By April 23rd, the two districts had sown over 70,000 mu, accounting for 70% of all land. The remaining 30% can be sown by April 26th. During the ideological mobilization, the village schools launched the "Think What, Say What" movement, encouraging the masses to expose their thoughts and realize from their heartfelt words that the struggle was against feudalism, not against getting rich; and to recognize that land reform was to eliminate obstacles on the road to getting rich, and that this year's great production movement was to universally achieve "cultivate three, surplus one" (耕三余一 - a goal of leaving 1/3 of the harvest to the farmer). Da Jing Village raised the question: Who is the tail? On whom does the tail grow? to let everyone discuss. Li Yulong said, "Our village has not struggled against a single laborer who started from scratch in recent years, but against six feudal exploiters." Song Dou said, "Chairman Mao's words are not empty talk, leading us to turn over and now leading us to 'cultivate three, surplus one' and live a good life." After clearing their minds, the Sixth District used precise calculations to increase the masses' confidence in achieving "cultivate three, surplus one." For example, after accounting, Lao Dai Village could have 45 households achieving "cultivate two, surplus one," 13 households achieving "cultivate one, surplus one," and 16 households achieving "cultivate three, surplus one." Only four households of elderly widows and widowers without labor, with 11 mu of land for four people, could not meet the standard after deducting wages. The cooperative plans to help each household buy two piglets and subsidize them to produce bean sprouts and other sideline production. This way, they can also achieve "cultivate three, surplus one." After the accounting, everyone was in high spirits, and the women, in addition to working in the fields, had to complete spinning two liang of cotton every day from early morning to late night.

    [Report from this newspaper in Zuoquan] After rectifying relationships, the relationship between cadres and the masses in the fifth district's villages has been improved, and the fear of getting rich has also been initially resolved. Now, mutual aid sowing is being carried out. Under the leadership of labor heroes in various villages, Shuipo Village, after resolving concerns about the fear of getting rich, reorganized the labor and livestock division of labor in the entire village, dividing them into tillage groups, sowing groups, and digging groups, and organizing five technical guidance groups. On an individual level, the goal is to earn more points and work more to improve efficiency. Furthermore, a method for dividing agricultural tools was studied, solving the problem of difficulty in using agricultural tools and the tendency to only use them without repairing them. It is stipulated that one day of using a jué (missing tone) costs one point, wide jué (missing tone) costs five li, large hoe costs five li, small hoe costs three li, iron shovel costs three li, sieve costs five li, plowing, harrow and maintenance are evenly distributed per mu, and wages and work points are uniformly rated per day based on work and labor. The groups compete with each other, with great enthusiasm. By the 26th of last month, more than 700 mu had been sown. The entire village will complete sowing by May 5th. In Naogou, more than 250 mu have already been sown out of less than 400 mu of land. Currently, incomplete statistics from 15 villages in the entire district show that 4,000 mu have been sown. The three joint defenses in the northeast and central regions are in the tense stage of sowing, while the southwest joint defense is sowing cotton and scattering seeds in sloping fields, and is beginning to sow flat land.
