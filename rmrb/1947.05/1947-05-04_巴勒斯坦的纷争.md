The conflict in Palestine has evolved into a long-term one. On the surface, it appears to be a conflict between Arabs and Jews, but it actually contains two factors: (1) the contradiction between various Arab countries and British imperialism; (2) the contradiction between British and American imperialism. At present, with the United States supporting the forceful intrusion of Jews into Palestine, the latter factor is stronger than the former.

Creating and provoking contradictions between ethnic groups in colonies is one of the basic policies of British imperialism in ruling colonies. As early as 1917, Britain issued a declaration recognizing the right of Jews to return to Palestine and establish a national homeland. This became a prerequisite for Britain to obtain the mandate to rule Palestine after the First World War. However, in 1939, the Chamberlain government issued a White Paper announcing that the number of Jews to be transferred to Palestine in the next five years would be limited to 75,000. This decision encouraged Arabs to exclude Jews. Through this war, British colonial rule became unstable again. The Arabs organized the "Arab League" to oppose Britain. This prompted Britain to bring up the old issue again, transferring Jews into Palestine to provoke the Arab-Jewish conflict, in order to paralyze the Arab's anti-British consciousness.

The United States, which is currently becoming an aggressor in the world, proposed to Britain in mid-November of the year before last that 100,000 Jews who survived the German "refugee camps" should be transferred to Palestine to simply establish a "Jewish state." Britain considered this plan too large, and in late July of last year, it proposed a counter-proposal, namely the "Palestine Federation" plan. The plan agreed to the transfer of 100,000 Jews into Palestine, but Palestine must be divided into two autonomous states: an Arab autonomous state occupying 85 percent of the total area of Palestine, and the remaining 15 percent being the so-called "Jewish autonomous state." At the same time, two conditions were put forward: (1) these two autonomous states should be under British jurisdiction; (2) the United States should allocate 100.5 million US dollars to the Middle East Arab countries. This counter-proposal was first opposed by American financial capitalists (American monopoly capital had long coveted the oil in Palestine, while the oil rights were in the hands of the British). Truman cabled Britain on August 15 last year, proposing a new plan that was even more "specific and clear": This plan first advocated expanding the Jewish autonomous region, including the entire northern half of Palestine except for the Galilee (area north of the strait) and the Nablus triangle area (north of Jerusalem), and demanded that Jewish areas be designated in Jerusalem and Bethlehem, the holy land in southern Palestine (more than twice the area of the Jewish area proposed by the British), and furthermore advocated abolishing the British mandate over Palestine. These nakedly expressed the greed of American oil merchants, where "oil is thicker than blood," and directly opened fire with British capitalism. After Britain expressed "great difficulty in agreeing" to this, it convened representatives of Middle Eastern Arab countries and the representatives of the world's Jewish organization—the Jewish Agency—in London in October last year to perform a "consultation" farce, that is, ignoring the "American policy of independently liberating Jews" and trying to persuade the representatives of both Arabs and Jews to agree to the British "Federation plan." Before the meeting was held, it was resisted by the United States. With the support of the United States, the Jewish Agency put forward stricter conditions than Truman's new plan, that is, refusing to participate in the meeting unless a Jewish state was established. Under this deserted situation, Britain still supported the progress of the meeting, and Prime Minister Attlee personally delivered a speech, asking the Arab representatives to support the federal plan, and saying: "The British government will do its best to help the Arabs. For certain reasons (referring to the expansionist policy of the United States), the British policy conflicts with the wishes of the Arabs"; but the only gain from this "consultation" meeting, which took a lot of time and effort, was: "All Arab representatives opposed the British federal plan." (Here we can see that the Arabs not only oppose the intrusion of the Jews supported by the United States, but also oppose the divisive policies of the British Empire).

The United States expressed impatience with Britain's "dragging its feet" attitude. Former US Secretary of State Byrnes issued a tough statement in November last year: "The State Department will wholeheartedly support Truman's policy of demanding the immediate entry of Jewish immigrants into Palestine, and insist on the Jewish state advocated by the Jewish Agency"; at the same time, Jewish organizations in the United States issued war-preparation slogans on secret radio stations and carried out anti-British riots. At the same time, the spokesman of the "Palestine Foundation Committee" in New York shouted that Britain was excluding American manufacturers and merchants in Palestine, and called on the United States to "change this situation." It clearly shows that under the expansionist policy of the United States, it is using the Jews as scapegoats to attack British imperialism, insisting on getting all the oil rights and military bases in the "Jewish state" to be satisfied. British imperialism, on the other hand, still wants to seize the rule of Palestine and implement the division of Arab unity in order to feel at ease. In this way, the contradiction between British and American imperialism in Palestine is always developing. If the local people do not rise up and drive away imperialism, the disasters given to the Arabs and Jews under these contradictions will never be eliminated.

### 巴勒斯坦的纷争

　　巴勒斯坦的纷争
    巴勒斯坦的纷争演成长期性的了，表面看来是阿拉伯与犹太人之争，实际包含两个因素：（一）各阿拉伯国家与英帝国主义的矛盾；（二）英美帝国主义的矛盾，在目前，美国支持犹太人强行侵入巴境的情况下，后者的因素较前者更强烈。
    制造与挑拨殖民地民族间的矛盾，是英帝国主义统治殖民地基本政策之一。远在一九一七年，英国发表宣言，承认犹太人重返巴境建立民族祖居之权，这成为第一次大战结束后，英国取得巴勒斯坦委任统治的一个先决条件。然而到了一九三九年，张伯伦政府发表白皮书，宣布于以后五年间，把犹太人移置巴境的数目，限制为七万五千人，这一决定鼓励了阿拉伯人排斥犹太人。通过这次战争，英国的殖民地统治又趋于不稳定状态，阿拉伯人组织了“阿拉伯联盟”以反英，这使英国又重提旧事，把犹太人移入巴境挑起阿、犹之争，以麻痹阿拉伯人的反英意识。
    目前成为世界侵略者的美国，于前年十一月中旬向英国提出建议，将德国“难民营”幸存的十万犹人移入巴境，干脆建立“犹太国”。这一计划英国认为过于庞大，而于去年七月下旬提出一个对案，即“巴勒斯坦联邦”计划。该计划同意十万犹人移入巴境，但须将巴勒斯坦划分为阿、犹两个自治邦：阿拉伯自治邦占巴境总面积百分之八十五，其余百分之十五是所谓“犹太自治邦”了。同时提出二个条件：（一）此二自治邦应在英国管辖之下；（二）由美国拨款十万五千万美元予中东各阿拉伯国家。这一对案首先遭到美国金融资本家的反对（美独占资本早已垂涎巴境的石油，而油权在英人之手），而经杜鲁门于去年八月十五日照会英国，提出一个更见“具体明朗”的新方案：该方案首先主张扩大犹人自治区，包括除加里两部（海峡以北地区）奈勃鲁斯三角地带（耶路撒冷以北）外的整个巴勒斯坦北半部，并要求在耶路撒冷及巴勒斯坦南部的圣地伯利恒划出犹人区（超过英方建议犹区地域二倍以上），另外更主张取消英国对巴勒斯坦的委任统治权。这些赤裸裸表示出美国石油商人“油浓于血”的贪欲，而与英国资本主义直接开火。英国对此表示“万难同意”之后，于去年十月在伦敦召集中东各阿拉伯国家代表与全世界的犹太组织——犹太事务局的代表搬演“协商”戏法，即不睬“美国单独解放犹人”的方针，而欲说服阿、犹双方代表同意英国的“联邦计划”。该会召开之前，即遭美国的抵制，在美国支持下，犹太事务局提出较杜鲁门的新方案更严格的条件，即在除非成立犹太国的前提下，拒绝参加会议。英国在此冷落情景下仍支持会议的进行，首相艾德礼并亲临演说，要求各阿拉伯代表赞成联邦计划，并称：“英政府将尽力帮助阿拉伯人，由于某些理由（指美国的扩张政策）才使英国的政策和阿拉伯人的愿望发生矛盾”；但是这一经过不少时日，费尽口舌的“协商”会议之唯一收获是：“各阿拉伯代表均反对英国的联邦计划”。（这里可看出阿拉伯人既反对美国支持着的犹太人的侵入，也反对英帝国的分化政策）。
    对于英国“拖泥带水”的态度，美国表示不耐烦。美前国务卿贝纳斯于去年十一月发出强硬声明：“国务院将全心全意支持杜鲁门要求立即让犹太移民进入巴境的政策，并坚持犹太事务局所主张的犹太国家”；与此同时，在美国的犹人组织，于秘密电台发出战准备口号，实行反英暴动。同时纽约的“巴勒斯坦基金委员会”发言人大呼英国在巴境排斥美国制造家与商人，呼吁美国“应改变此种情况”。明显表现出美国的扩张政策下，拿犹太人作替罪的羔羊，向英帝国主义进攻，硬要得“犹太国”里的全部石油权与军事基地而甘心。英帝国主义呢，则还是要揪着巴勒斯坦的统治，实行分化阿拉伯人的团结而安心。如此，英美帝国主义在巴勒斯坦的矛盾始终在发展，当地人民不起来把帝国主义赶走，这些矛盾之下所给予阿拉伯人与犹太人的灾害是永远不会消灭的。
