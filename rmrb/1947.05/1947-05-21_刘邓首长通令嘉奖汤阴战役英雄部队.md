　　Liu Bocheng and Deng Xiaoping recently issued a commendation to the heroic troops who fought in the Tangyin operation. The original text is as follows: "During the Tangyin operation, our Zhi-character troops, with their brave and decisive assault and combat, repelled more than a dozen enemy counterattacks and finally completed the arduous task of annihilating the Chiang Kai-shek pseudo-army of Sun Dianying. We hereby commend them. The Shan-character troops and the Quan-character troops, with their decisive and agile actions, seized the opportunity to blow open the West Gate of the city and break into the city. This active cooperation is also hereby commended in a circular."
    [Another dispatch] The 666th unit, in attacking Tangyin City, due to its swift and courageous actions and flexible command, continuously defeated eleven enemy counterattacks and finally annihilated the enemy. They also observed battlefield discipline and urban policies well. The Party Committee and Merit Citation Committee of the 16th Brigade gave the unit a major merit citation. Letters were sent and special personnel dispatched to express condolences.
   (Li Le)
    [Our Correspondent on the Henan-Hebei Front, 19th] The People's Liberation Army maintained good discipline and order during the recovery of Tangyin, without committing the slightest offense, which was deeply praised by the residents of the city. After the battle, except for a few staff members, the troops withdrew entirely outside the city at dawn, carrying only prisoners and military supplies. When the troops searched for the remaining enemy, they asked the landlords to accompany them, without causing the slightest disturbance. Many people only realized that Sun Dianying's troops had been completely wiped out when they opened their doors the next day. The people boldly stood at their doors to watch, and even more people set up tea stalls in front of their doors and in the streets and alleys to welcome the Liberation Army. They expressed great admiration for the Liberation Army's discipline of not disturbing the chickens or dogs. When Liberation Army staff went to various shops to investigate the losses of the masses, the people gratefully said, "Nothing was lost. Your rules are so good. We have never seen such a troop." Luo Tianfu, a teacher at Tangyin Normal School, said that he initially thought the Eighth Route Army would close the school, but the troops did not even enter it. Zhao Jinqiu, the quartermaster of the 4th Company of a certain regiment, had purchased eighty catties of vegetables from vegetable vendor Che Lu on the north side of West Street in the city when the troops withdrew in October two years ago. Because he was away on a business trip, he did not have time to pay for them. Now, although two years have passed, they rushed into the city to repay the debt. In order to prevent the vendor from suffering a loss, the owed vegetable money was converted into nineteen catties of millet at the market price. The vendor was extremely moved and thought it was a dream that he could never have imagined. In addition, relief work was also done quickly and in a timely manner. The people who suffered from the war received a large amount of food and clothing. The people who received relief all said, "The Eighth Route Army is truly helping those in need." According to the person in charge of a certain unit that recovered Tangyin, the unit regarded discipline and combat as equally important and made it one of its main tasks.

　　刘邓首长通令嘉奖汤阴战役英雄部队
    【本报豫北前线十八日电】刘伯承、邓小平二将军，顷通令表扬汤阴作战的英雄部队。原文如下：汤阴作战中，我志字部队以英勇果敢的突击和搏斗，击退敌十数次的反扑，终于圆满完成歼灭蒋伪军孙殿英所部的艰巨任务，特予嘉奖。山字部队的全字部队，以果敢机敏的动作，不失时机的炸开城西门突入城上，这种积极配合作用，亦予通报表扬。
    【另讯】六六六部队，攻打汤阴城，由于动作迅速勇猛，指挥灵活，连续击溃敌人十一次反扑，最后消灭了敌人，对战场纪律和城市政策遵守得好，十六大队党委会及立功委员会，特给该部队记大功一次。并写信和派专人前往慰问。                                         
   （勒励）
    【本报豫北前线十九日电】人民解放军于收复汤阴之役，纪律良好，秩序井然，秋毫无犯，深得该城居民赞扬。战斗结束后，除留下少数工作人员外，部队于天明全部撤出城外，只携带俘虏及军用品。部队搜索残敌时，都请房东伴同，丝毫不乱。许多群众于次日一开门，才知道孙殿英部已被全部肃清，老百姓都大胆的站在门口看，更有不少人在门前和街头巷尾摆设茶水，欢迎解放军。对于解放军鸡犬不惊的纪律，极表赞佩。当解放军工作人员到各商店调查群众损失时，老百姓都感激的说：“什么都没有丢，你们的规矩真好，从来没有见过这样的队伍。”汤阴师范学校的教员罗天福说，他最初以为八路军来了会封闭学校，想不到部队根本没有进去。某团四连司务长赵金邱、在前年十月部队撤退时，因出差在外，所购城内西街路北菜贩车鲁八十斤蔬菜没有来得及付钱，现在虽然事隔两年，他们急忙赶进城里归还。为了使小贩不吃亏，将所欠的菜钱按市价折成小米十九斤。小贩感动万分，认为是个梦也想不到的事。此外，救济工作亦做的迅速及时，因战争受难的老百姓都得到大批的粮食和衣物，得到救济的老百姓都说：“八路军真是救灾救难。”据收复汤阴之某部负责人说，该部把纪律和作战看作同样重要，并做为主要任务之一。
