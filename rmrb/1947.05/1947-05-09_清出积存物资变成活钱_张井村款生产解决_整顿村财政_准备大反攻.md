　　Clearing Out Stockpiled Materials to Turn Them into Cash
　　Zhangjing Village Solves Funding for Production
　　Rectifying Village Finances Preparing for a Major Counter-Offensive
　　[This newspaper, Pingshun News] The First District, in order to save financial resources to support the front lines and achieve village financial self-sufficiency, specially convened a village head meeting with the participation of more than 30 people. They studied how to rectify village finances, opened up the minds of village cadres, and researched rectification methods. After the Zhangjing Village cadres returned, they made great achievements. Their methods:
　　(1) Opening up the minds of cadres and the masses, clarifying the direction: After returning from the district meeting, Village Head Gu Qilu personally led the way, convened a meeting of all village cadres, and at the same time combined this with local production, allowing the masses to discuss. It was discovered that the general cadres and masses were unwilling to sell some old opera costumes, wanting to keep them for entertainment. Immediately, cadres and the masses were organized to discuss in groups, explaining that straightening things out would reduce our burden, and in the future, we would only have to pay public funds and public grain for two seasons each year. It was explained that in the future, when performing new operas, these things would not be needed, so it would be better to sell them and turn them into cash. After debate, their thinking was cleared, and they all clearly recognized that rectifying village finances was to reduce their own burden, support the front lines, and defeat Chiang Kai-shek. They all unanimously wanted to turn dead economy into a living economy.
　　(2) Cadres take the lead and mobilize the masses to find things. First, two representatives were selected from the masses, as well as the village head, political director, finance director, education director, head of the armed forces committee, and cooperative director, a total of eight people, to form an economic committee responsible for investigation and registration. After two days of investigation, a total of 80 opera costumes, two cloth sheds, 190 miscellaneous opera costumes, two trees, a total of five large and small temples (with 18 upper rooms and 41 rooms), 70 school tables, benches, and chairs, 7.4 mu of public land, 11,123 jin of millet in the voluntary granary, 1,665 jin of corn, and 711 jin of grain were registered. Excluding what was borrowed, there are currently 711 jin of grain, 1,528 jin of rice, and 102 jin of corn. The cooperative withdrew 30,000 yuan for public welfare funds. Previously, 1,862 jin of millet and 1,563 jin of corn were entered into the voluntary granary at the cooperative, totaling 11,500 yuan when converted. After registration, in order to thoroughly mobilize the masses to find public property, the cadres first spoke out about the things they had put in their own homes, influencing the masses to report voluntarily. A total of 13 items such as pots, stools, and door panels were found.
　　(3) Democratic discussion, selecting custodians and selling items. After the above rectification, the masses selected a management committee, and after democratic discussion, the results of the sale were as follows: opera costumes, cloth sheds, and miscellaneous opera costumes were sold for 319,750 yuan, one tree was sold for 35,000 yuan, and other miscellaneous items were sold for 30,000 yuan. Including 11,500 yuan from the cooperative, the total was 396,250 yuan. The remaining registered items were all kept in storage.
　　(4) Turning dead things into a living economy. First, the annual expenditure was calculated from a saving perspective: the village office's annual expenditure was 35,000 yuan, the armed forces committee's expenditure was 15,000 yuan, the education public funds were 22,000 yuan (including the civilian school), the teacher's salary was 1,920 jin of rice, and the bonus was 5,000 yuan, for a total of 79,000 yuan in regular expenses, plus 1,920 jin of millet (temporary expenses not included). It was then decided to use the funds from the rectification for: 1. Buying two mules for transportation. 2. Opening a mill. 3. Feeding two pigs. The plan was to buy two mules and use five days for each trip, totaling 48 trips in eight months throughout the year, carrying 2 shi and 4 dou each time, earning a total of 86 shi and 4 dou of rice. Three people doing it can earn 150,000 yuan. One opening a mill and feeding two pigs can solve the expenses of three people. In this way, a total of 14,256 jin of rice and 150,000 yuan can be earned. After deducting expenses, there will be a surplus of 71,000 yuan and a surplus of 8,376 jin of rice. After planning, the emotions of the cadres and masses in the entire village were particularly high. The entire village established a system that no random expenditures can be made without the approval of higher authorities. Two mules have now been bought back, and transportation, milling, and pig raising have all been started.

　　[This newspaper, Pingshun News] After three days of sorting out in Beishe Village, excluding the three large temples (used for factories and schools) and one ancestral hall (occupied by the village office), the total value of various materials is more than 780,000 yuan, enough for Beishe's two-year expenses. Taking out a large part or even all of it to invest in production, the annual dividends earned are enough to cover the annual expenses with a surplus, and this burden will never be asked of the masses permanently. If the village public property is not straightened out and the masses bear the burden, each person would have to pay an average of at least eight jin of millet per year (for village expenses). In this way, everyone broke the idea that "there is nothing to straighten out."

　　清出积存物资变成活钱
    张井村款生产解决
    整顿村财政  准备大反攻
    【本报平顺讯】一区为了节省财力支援前线，做到村财政自给，特召开村长会议，参加三十余人，研究了如何整顿村财政，打通了村干部思想，并且研究了整顿的办法。张井村干部回去后，即做出了很大成绩，其办法：
    （一）打通干部群众思想，明确方向，从区开会回来，村长谷起禄亲自领导，召开全体村干部会，同时结合在地生产让群众讨论，发现一般干部群众对村上一些旧戏行头不愿卖，想留着闹娱乐。当即组织干部群众分组讨论，说明整出来就减轻了咱们负担，以后只要每年出两季公款公粮就完了。说明今后唱新戏，这些东西就用不着了，不如卖了变成活钱。经过争论，打通了思想，都很明确的认识了整顿村财政是为自己减轻负担，支援前线，打垮蒋介石，都一致要把死经济变成活经济。
    （二）干部带头，发动群众找。首先在群众中选出两个代表，及村长、政治主任、财政主任、教育主任、武委会主任、合作社长等八人，成立经济委员会，负责调查登记。经过两天调查，共登记出戏衣八十件，布棚两件，杂戏衣一百九十件，树两棵，大小庙共五座（有楼十八间，房四十一间），学校棹、凳、椅等共七十件，公地七亩四分，义仓米一万一千一百二十三斤，玉茭一千六百六十五斤，谷七百一十一斤，除在外借的，现存谷七百一十一斤，米一千五百二十八斤，玉茭一百零二斤。合作社抽出公益金三万元，以前在合作社入义仓米一千八百六十二斤，玉茭一千五百六十三斤，两种共折洋一万一千五百元。经过登记后，为了彻底发动群众性找公产，首先干部先把自己家放的东西说出来，影响群众纷纷自报，计共找出锅、凳、门扇等十三件。
    （三）民主讨论，选出保管及变卖。经过以上整顿后，群众选出保管委员会，民主讨论变卖结果，把戏衣布棚杂戏衣卖三十一万九千七百五十元，卖树一棵三万五千元，其余零杂东西卖三万元。连合作社一万一千五百元，共三十九万六千二百五十元，其余登记出东西，都保管起。
    （四）死东西变成活经济。首先把全年开支从节约观点计算了一下，村公所一年开支三万五千元，武委会开支一万五千元，教育公费二万二千元（连民校），教员薪金米一千九百二十斤，奖金五千元，共经常费七万九千元，小米一千九百廿斤（临时费不在内）。乃决定用整顿出的款：一、买两头骡运输。二、开一个磨房。三、喂两个猪。计划买两头骡走一次用五天，全年计八个月共走四十八次，每次驮两石四斗，共赚米八十六石四斗。三个人搞，能赚十五万元，一个开磨房，喂两口猪，能解决三个人开支。这样共能赚米一万四千二百五十六斤，洋十五万元。除开支还余七万一千元，余米八千三百七十六斤。经过计划，全村群众干部情绪特别高涨。全村订出制度，不经上级批准不得乱支。现已买回两头骡子，运输、磨房、喂猪都已搞起来。

    【本报平顺讯】北社村经三天的整理，除留三座大庙（工厂、学校用）及一处词堂（村公所占）外，共计各种物资可值钱七十八万余元，足够北社二年经费用。拿出一大部甚至全部投资生产的话，每年分得红利足够每年经费开支而有余，这项负担就永久不会向群众要了。如果不整理村公产，让群众负担的话，每人每年至少平均八斤小米（村经费）。这样，大家打破了“没有啥整理”的想法。
