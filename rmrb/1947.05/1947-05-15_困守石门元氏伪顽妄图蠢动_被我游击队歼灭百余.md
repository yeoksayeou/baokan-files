The enemy remnants trapped in Yuanshi, Shijiazhuang, vainly attempt to move
Annihilated by Our Guerrilla Force, Suffering Over 100 Casualties

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] As the Taihang First Military Sub-district's guerrilla warfare unfolded, it achieved a double victory on April 29th, annihilating over 100 enemy soldiers and "Homecoming Corps" members (including company commanders and below), severely打击 and shattering the conspiracies of the isolated enemies and puppets garrisoning Shijiazhuang and Yuanshi to expand outward for plunder and restore their original ruling areas. After the battles on the outskirts of Shijiazhuang concluded, the Huolu Volunteer Militia (Homecoming Corps) reoccupied Nantongye (southwest of Shijiazhuang) in late April, forcibly conscripting laborers daily to repair the destroyed fortifications, and scattering to reside outside the villages at night. Our Huolu Independent Battalion and other units attacked the enemy at dawn on April 29th, capturing 41, seizing 29 rifles, 3 pistols, and over 1,000 rounds of ammunition, with no casualties on our side. On the morning of the same day, over 500 troops from the 17th Regiment of the puppet army stationed in Yuanshi, led by Wei Yonghe, attempted to outflank and encircle our × unit stationed in Nancheng (north of Yuanshi City) in two routes. Our troops remained resolute and calm, suddenly opening fire with machine guns and rifles when the enemy approached within 100 meters, inflicting heavy casualties. The enemy was ultimately forced back to Chenguozhuang (west of Nancheng), and our troops then bravely pursued, capturing 16 soldiers including a platoon leader, and killing or wounding Ma Ruji, the company commander of the Second Battalion, and another company commander and over 50 other soldiers of Wei Yonghe's main force (his main Second Company had collapsed, and the Third Company was devastated). One machine gun, 21 rifles, and one pistol were seized. The masses celebrated upon hearing the news. In total, over 100 enemy soldiers and "Homecoming Corps" members, including company and platoon leaders and below, were annihilated on that day, with 57 captured, over 50 killed or wounded, and the seizure of one machine gun, over 50 rifles, 4 pistols, and a large quantity of ammunition.
