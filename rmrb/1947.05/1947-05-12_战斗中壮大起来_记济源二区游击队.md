　　Growing Stronger in Battle
    ——A Record of the Jiyuan Second District Guerrilla Unit
    Gu Weijin
    On April 15th, I interviewed Comrade Wang Jie, the leader of a small, twelve-member guerrilla unit from the Second District of Jiyuan, who persisted in guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines for five months, recovered 26 villages, protected land reform in two-thirds of the villages, and eliminated 133 enemy soldiers. He is the deputy instructor of the Second District, 26 years old. He recounted to me how he launched guerrilla warfare on the basis of counter-struggle against "reversal of verdicts" (倒算), and carried out land reform; and how, on the basis of land reform, he expanded guerrilla warfare. He said: "When the enemy occupied Jiyuan City last December, the Second District, which had turned behind enemy lines, became a world of bandits, armed special agents, and 'reversal of verdicts' teams. Within a month, more than 60 cadres and activists were massacred, and the fruits of their efforts, valued at 7.1 million yuan, were reversed. Fear and wavering dominated the thinking of some cadres. I led three cadres and four militiamen to break into the grid network north of the Mang River, driving away the Kuomintang army's 'reversal of verdicts' team of more than 30 men led by Fan Dengke, and even captured one of them, scaring the 'reversal of verdicts' teams along the Mang River from acting openly. At this time, we understood that the deeper we went behind enemy lines, the more sparse the enemy became. This victory motivated all the militiamen to fight back into the grid network, so we clearly defined our operational policy: 'Dispersed activities, attacking everywhere, avoiding hard battles, and focusing on attacking the "reversal of verdicts" teams.' But after breaking into the grid network, we encountered a difficulty, which was the Battle of Dajiao. One militiaman was sacrificed, and the enemy spread rumors that many militiamen had been sacrificed, and some militiamen's families were holding them back. At that time, fifteen militiamen returned home. It was also winter, the militiamen had no cotton clothes, and supplies became a problem. The difficulties reached their peak. At this time, we gritted our teeth and fought against the enemy's disintegration offensive. First, we educated the militiamen with the fact that the enemy had killed more than 60 cadres, that there was no way out if they went back, and for those militiamen who were determined to go back, we let them go, telling them that if they couldn't stand it after going back, they could still come back. Afterwards, we used the examples of those who returned to educate them, and the militiamen's understanding was improved. In order to boost morale, we launched a campaign to establish merit by eliminating the enemy. Regardless of the front or the rear, great or small merits were all commended and recorded in the merit book. This made the militiamen happily say: 'Our blood and sweat are not shed in vain,' and their confidence was greatly increased; but the masses' thinking was still confused. We propagandized while fighting, distributing more than 30 kinds of propaganda materials such as comparing the People's Liberation Army with the Chiang Kai-shek puppet army, and issuing announcements warning the 'reversal of verdicts' teams to leave a way out. By January, we had defeated more than 200 'reversal of verdicts' teams along the Mang River, and carried out land reform in one village after defeating it. Twelve villages had carried out land reform. We also organized joint village defense and established home protection teams, using a large number of old-fashioned weapons. The situation of the enemy being strong and us being weak began to change, and the enemies all rolled back to the south bank of the Mang River. With the support of the turned-over peasants in these twelve villages, we crossed the Mang River to attack the enemy. At this time, it was the Lunar New Year. In order to protect the masses during the New Year, we launched a counter-'maintenance' struggle, defeating the enemy in Longtai with a combination of thunder guns. Because we were active every day, the masses' emotions changed. They said: 'Stay with us, even if you only fire one shot, it will be worthwhile!' They took the initiative to organize armed village governments and set up sentry posts, resolutely refusing to maintain the enemy. When the enemy sent letters extorting grain, they replied: 'We have grain, but the Eighth Route Army is very active and we dare not send it. Come and get it!' Taking advantage of this opportunity, land reform was also carried out on the south bank of the Mang River, and joint defense was organized with the villages on the north bank. In order to cover the land reform on the south bank, we took a step forward and advanced to the southern mountains on the border of Ji and Meng. This was a den of enemy bandits, with overlapping mountains. The highest point was the Longtai enemy stronghold, surrounded by eight 'maintenance' villages within a mile or two. We first blocked the Longtai enemy with thunder guns, and then operated day and night in the 'maintenance' villages, publicizing current events and land reform, and using private relationships between militiamen to win over the 'maintenance' villages to contact us and establish intelligence. As a result, we truly grasped the enemy's situation, while the enemy could not figure out our intentions at all. The enemy had to hide in the stronghold and dared not come out, and when they occasionally came out, they were often beaten. Now the villages on the south bank of the Mang River are stepping up the completion of land reform. Thus, since November of last year, for five months we have driven the enemy from the north bank of the Mang River to the south bank, and then from this plain to the southern mountains, recovering 26 villages in the entire Second District, and completing land reform in two-thirds of the villages. In the past five months, our guerrilla unit has fought more than 100 battles, killing, wounding, and capturing 133 Chiang Kai-shek puppet soldiers and 'reversal of verdicts' team leaders, including Li Zhenjiang. We only sacrificed one person. The main experience of our guerrilla warfare this time is that it has combined the counter-'reversal of verdicts,' counter-'maintenance,' and land reform, gaining the support of the broad masses of peasants and becoming a mass guerrilla war. Therefore, it has become stronger and larger with each battle. Secondly, a merit campaign has been launched universally in the front and rear, creating a situation where everyone is energetic and brave."

　　战斗中壮大起来
    ——记济源二区游击队
    古维进
    四月十五日，记者访问领导一个十二人的小型游击队、坚持五个月的敌后游击战争、收复村庄二十六处、掩护三分之二的村庄进行土地改革、歼敌一三三名的济源二区游击队队长王杰同志。他是二区副指导员，现年二十六岁，他对记者叙述他如何在反倒算基础上展开游击战争，进行土地改革；又如何在土地改革基础上，扩大游击战争的故事说：“当去年十二月敌占济源城后，转入敌后的二区，便成为土匪、武装特务、倒算队的世界，一个月内，被屠杀的干部、积极分子便有六十余人，被倒算的果实达七百一十万元，恐惧与动摇支配着一部分干部的思想。我带领三个干部和四个民兵突进蟒河北岸格子网内，把蒋军范登科三十多人的‘倒算队’赶跑，还捉住一个，吓得蟒河沿岸的‘倒算队’不敢公开活动。这时我们懂得了越深入敌后，敌人越稀松。这一胜利推动全体民兵，都要打回格子网去，于是我们便明确定出作战方针：‘分散活动，到处出击，不打硬仗，专打‘倒算队’。’但在突进格子网后，碰到一个困难，就是大桥一战，一个民兵牺牲了，敌人便造谣说民兵牺牲很多，有些民兵家属拉民兵后腿。当时有十五个民兵回了家，又是冬天，民兵没有棉衣，给养也成问题，困难达到顶点。这时我们咬紧牙关与敌人的瓦解攻势作斗争，首先以敌人杀害六十余干部的事实教育民兵，回去没有出路，对于决心要回去的民兵让他们回去，告诉他们如果回去站不住还可以回来。随后又以返回来的人的实例进行教育，民兵的认识提高了。为了提高士气，我们又开展了歼敌立功运动，不管前方后方，大功小功，一律表扬，记在功劳簿上，这一来民兵高兴的说：‘血汗不是白流的’，信心大为提高；可是群众思想却还是混乱的。我们一面打仗一面宣传，散发解放军与蒋伪军比一比等三十多种宣传品，出布告警告‘倒算队’留后路。到一月份止，我们共打垮蟒河沿岸‘倒算队’二百余名，打垮一个村随即进行一个村的土地改革，有十二个村都进行了土地改革。我们又组织联村联防，组织保家队，大量使用旧式武器，敌强我弱的形势开始转变，敌人都滚到蟒河南岸去了。我们凭着这十二个村翻身农民的支持，南渡蟒河袭击敌人。这时正是阴历年关，为保护群众过年，又开展了反‘维持’斗争，以雷枪结合打垮龙台敌人。由于我们每天活动，群众情绪转变了。他们说：‘你们住下吧，那管你们响一枪也顶事’！纷纷自动组织武装村公所，设置了望监视哨，坚决不维持敌人。当敌人来信勒索粮食时，他们回信说：‘粮食是有，就是八路军活动厉害，不敢送去，你们来拿吧’！趁着这个机会，蟒河南岸也进行了土地改革，并与北岸的村庄联防。为掩护南岸土地改革，我们又向前推进一步，挺进到济、孟边缘的南岭上，这里是敌人土匪窝，山峦重叠，最高处是龙台敌人据点，周围一二里内有八个维持村，我们首先以雷枪封锁龙台敌人，然后日夜在维持村活动，宣传时事及土地改革，并利用民兵私人关系，争取维持村与我们接头，建立了情报，于是我们确实掌握了敌人的情况，而敌人却摸不着我们一点内情，敌人只得藏在据点里不敢出来，偶然出来多是挨打。现在蟒河南岸的村庄，正在加紧完成土地改革。就这样，自去年十一月起，五个月来我们把敌人从蟒河北岸赶到南岸，再从这块平原把敌人赶到南岭上，收复全二区的村庄二十六个，有三分之二的村庄完成土地改革。五个月来我们游击队作战一百余次，毙伤俘蒋伪军‘倒算’队长李振江以下一百三十三名，我们仅牺牲一名。我们这次游击战争的主要经验，是结合了反‘倒算’、反‘维持’与土地改革，得到广大农民支持，成为群众性的游击战争，因此愈战愈强、愈战愈大。其次，前线后方普遍展开立功运动，造成人人有劲个个奋勇。”
