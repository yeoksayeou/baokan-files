　　The Paper Celebrates Its First Anniversary with a Tea Party
    Symposium to Strengthen Reporting Work
    [Our Dispatch] The fifteenth marked the first anniversary of the founding of this newspaper. All comrades in the entire office spent the day with both excitement and a sense of urgency. On this day, we were honored to have leading cadres from the Border Region's Party, government, military, and civil organizations, as well as colleagues from the cultural circles, come to offer their congratulations. A tea party was held at 1:00 PM, during which Comrade Pan Shi sincerely solicited opinions from the comrades present to improve and enhance the work of the newspaper. Yuan Zhihe, Director of the Border Region Government, pointed out the newspaper's achievements over the past year in reflecting and guiding the self-defense war and the land reform movement. He said, "The newspaper should publish more on issues related to the people's struggle. In reporting, it is necessary to overcome negative factors, promote positive factors, and seize the creations of the masses (such as the Second Du Ba Lian in Jiyuan and the masses in Yetao, Wu'an, evaluating merit and supporting cadres). Comrade Wang Zhongqing of the Central Bureau's Propaganda Department said: The People's Daily has made significant progress in integrating with reality as the work in the entire region develops, implementing the Party's policies, and reflecting the creations of the masses. He hopes that in the future, each edition will more closely coordinate with the current central tasks, better reflecting the ideological reality and struggle reality of the masses in the Border Region. People's writer Zhao Shuli provided some suggestions to the newspaper from the perspective of the demands of the masses. Comrade Huangmei hoped that while the newspaper focuses on reflecting the requirements of the central work, it should also reflect the various creations of the masses from the side and pay attention to the activities on the entire region's cultural front. In addition, comrades from the Border Region People's Art Troupe, Xinhua Bookstore, and other organizations provided many valuable opinions on how the newspaper can closely connect with reality and the masses. The guests and hosts chatted harmoniously. Finally, Comrade Pan Shi expressed his gratitude for everyone's care and help, and explained the shortcomings of the newspaper over the past year and where efforts should be strengthened. In addition to encouraging all comrades in the newspaper to strengthen their learning and improve their professional skills, he also hoped that everyone would provide assistance at any time to make the newspaper better. The symposium lasted for three hours. Afterwards, a dinner was held, and in the evening, the People's Art Troupe performed plays such as "Zhou Zishan."
