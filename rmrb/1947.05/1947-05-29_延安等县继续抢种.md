Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, May 25th: The more than 400,000 mu of summer and autumn fields that were rushed to be planted around the Grain Rain solar term in Yan'an, Anse, and Zhidan counties have now mostly sprouted. Millet is already more than two inches tall. The production enthusiasm of the masses is very high, and they are still continuing to rush planting. In the Panlong and Hezhuang districts of Yan'an County, which are close to the enemy-occupied areas, the masses carry backpacks and dry food to sow in the fields every day, and drive their livestock to move when the enemy comes. Some farmers in Anse have organized mutual aid teams, and are helping some refugees who moved from Yan'an to adjust land and implement joint planting. In addition, the county government has also purchased more than 1,000 plows for the masses, solving the difficulty of agricultural implements. In the 5th district and 2nd township of Anse, which was once devastated by the enemy, the district and township cadres are busy helping the returning masses to rebuild their homes, and concentrating the guerrilla teams in the whole district to appropriate locations to protect the masses' production. At the same time, they helped more than 80 farmers who suffered the most from the disaster. Village cadres widely mobilized the masses to mutually adjust seeds and food.

　　延安等县继续抢种
    【新华社西北二十五日电】延安、安塞、志丹三县于谷雨节前后抢种之四十多万亩夏秋田，现已大部出苗。谷子已长二寸多高。群众生产情绪甚高，现仍继续抢种。接近敌占区之延安县蟠龙、河庄等区群众，每天背上背包驮上干粮揭地下种，敌人来了赶着牲口转移。安塞部分农民已组织了扎变工队，并帮助部分延安移来之难民调剂土地实行伙种。此外该县县府还替群众采购铧一千多页，解决了农具困难。一度遭敌摧残的安塞五区二乡，区乡干部正忙着帮助归来群众重建家园，并将全区游击队集中到适当地点掩护群众生产。同时对遭灾最重的农民帮了八十多个工。乡村干部则广泛发动群众互相调剂种籽、粮食。
