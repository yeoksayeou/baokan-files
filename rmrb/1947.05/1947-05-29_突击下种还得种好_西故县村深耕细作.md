　　Rush Planting Still Needs to be Done Well
　　Xiguxian Village Engages in Deep Plowing and Careful Cultivation
　　[Our newspaper Changzhi News] Xiguxian Village in the Second District has a total of 228 households, and 80% have joined mutual aid teams. After more than 20 days of rush planting, all 830.02 mu of millet and 915.9 mu of corn have been planted. The masses reflected, "This year there is such a lack of labor, but we finished earlier than last year!" The village's ability to achieve such results lies primarily in solving the following major problems: (1) To solve the lack of labor for participation in the war and production, implement large-scale labor exchange between the front and rear, establish confidence in production, and expand the area of labor burden. The whole village has a total of 102 able-bodied laborers, 18 went to participate in the war, and 17 are engaged in sideline occupations. Each full laborer averages 32.2 mu of land. At that time, the masses lacked confidence, so it was proposed that participation in the war should not be all at once, but in rotation. As long as we organize, we are not afraid. We also discussed the method of returning labor for participation in the war, issuing work points according to the time of participation in the war, setting the wage for participation in the war at 10 jin of millet, which is 3 jin more than the general wage. Those participating in the war save 10 jin of rice per work point, so they go to the field themselves to save work points. For example, Niu Sanle's wife said, "As long as you carry fertilizer and accumulate fertilizer for me, my daughter and I can do it." And those at home are also actively returning labor in order to save rice, and everyone is very enthusiastic. (2) Organize women and children, and use labor appropriately. The whole village organized a total of 78 women, who farmed a total of 250 mu, equivalent to 500 male laborers. Thirty-two children were organized, who farmed a total of 46 mu, equivalent to 92 full male laborers. At the same time, the practice of doing what one can do, and using labor appropriately, was generally implemented, with the exchange of work points being equal and fair, so that neither side suffered, and half laborers could also match full laborers. The scoring is based on adding or subtracting points according to whether the land is good or bad to work on. Su Fugou's land is easy to work on, so 6 fen of land is equivalent to one work point, while Su Desuo's land is difficult to work on, so 5 fen is equivalent to one work point. Carrying manure is done in rotation, and points are calculated according to the distance of the land and the number of times it is carried, so that neither side suffers. (3) Get through ideological bottlenecks and emphasize deep plowing, careful cultivation, and more fertilizer application. During planting, it was discovered that some masses were plowing and working carelessly, wanting to plant corn without plowing, so a meeting of cadres, activists, and general masses was convened to discuss who was engaged in deep plowing and careful cultivation and who was engaged in rough plowing and rough work. But this can only have an influence, and we must go deeper to understand their ideological problems. For example, Chunlai's family has 10 mu of corn to be planted in one go. He said that it costs 140 jin of rice to plow once, wouldn't it be better to buy fertilizer with this rice and apply it to the land than to plow it? Ma Shunqi has 4 mu of corn and doesn't want to return labor because he is afraid of coming out, saying, "It's rush planting, just plant it in one go (using the excuse that time is running out)." We used an accounting method to chat with them, saying that rush planting is not just about planting it, it must be done well. If plowing is not effective, who will suffer from the lack of grain? As long as you participate in mutual aid and return the labor, you won't come out. After such large and small meetings and individual mobilization, all 41 households with 148 mu of land who were prepared to plant in one go plowed the land again after solving their ideological problems. Calculating that each mu yields one dou more grain, they can yield 224 shi more. (4) Praising models must also be done with insight into their thoughts. During the rush spring plowing, it was discovered that women like Guo Xiaojing, Ma Juze, and Yan Manjing were very active, and their names were broadcasted at night. The next day, the women in the group were not enthusiastic, and said to Guo and others, "You are models, it's your glory that you do well, just do it well." When broadcasting the next night, we grasped the masses' thoughts and first broadcast that the women in the first and third groups were all good, but Guo Xiaojing got up early and could call people; Ma Juze and Yan Manjing did the land flat and fast. In this way, everyone not only did not oppose them, but also began to learn from them. Praising women and children inspired the young people, such as Cao Qishan and Yao Geji, who said, "Can't we get broadcasted too?" They started early and worked late to catch up, becoming models in the group, and sparking a challenge competition between the first and third groups.

　　突击下种还得种好
    西故县村深耕细作
    【本报长治讯】二区西故县村全村二百二十八户，百分之八十参加了互助组。经过二十余天的突击下种，将八百三十亩零二分谷、九百一十五亩九分玉茭全部完成下种。群众反映说：“今年劳力这样缺乏，比去年还完的早哩！”该村能有如此成绩，首先在于解决了以下几个主要问题：（一）解决参战、生产劳力缺乏，实行前后方大变工，树立生产信心，扩大劳力负担面积。全村能支差的共有劳力一百零二人，参战走了十八个，有十七个搞副业，每个全劳力平均三十二亩二分地，当时群众缺乏信心，即提出参战不是一齐走，是轮流去，只要咱们组织起来就不怕。又讨论出参战还工办法，按参战时间发给工票，定出参战工资小米十斤，比一般工资多三斤，参战人省一工工票十斤米，为省工自己就上地。如牛三乐妻说：“只要给我担肥，积肥，我和我闺女也能干。”而在家的为了省米也都积极的还工，大家都很起劲。（二）组织妇女、儿童，适当使用劳力。全村共组织妇女七十八个，共＠地二百五十亩，折男工五百个。组织儿童三十二个，共＠地四十六亩，折男全劳力工九十二个。同时，普遍实行了能干啥就干啥，适当使用劳力，折工等价公道，以活计工，互不吃亏，使半劳力也能顶全劳力。计分是按地的好不好做加减分数，苏福狗地好做，是六分地顶一工，苏德锁地难做五分顶一工。担圊是轮担数，按地的远近与担的次数计分，这样做到了互不吃亏。（三）打通思想，强调深耕细作多上粪。在下种时发现有些群众粗耕粗做，不犁就要栽玉茭，就召开干部积极分子及一般群众会议，讨论谁是深耕细作，谁是粗耕粗作。但这只能起一种影响作用，还得深入去了解其思想问题。如春来家有十亩玉茭要一茬栽，他说＠一次得一百四十斤米，有这些米买成肥上到地里不比＠次地强？马顺其有四亩玉茭因怕出来，不想还工，说：“突击下种哩，一茬栽上就是（借口说是时间赶不上）。”就用算账方式和他们闲扯，说突击下种不是种上就算，还得种好哩，犁一次顶事不顶事，少粮食是苦了谁？只要参加互助还了工就不出来了。经过这样大会小会讨论，个别动员，全村四十一户有一百四十八亩地准备一茬栽，经过解决思想后，都又犁了地，按每亩多打粮食一斗算，能多打二百二十四石。（四）表扬模范也必须摸心思。在突击春耕时，发现了妇女郭小景、马菊则、阎满景等很积极，晚上广播了她们的名字。第二天组内妇女就不起劲，并对郭等说：“你是模范你做的好还不是你的光荣你好好做吧。”第二天晚上广播时，摸住了群众心思，首先广播第一、三组妇女都好，但数郭小景起的早，能叫人；马菊则、阎满景做的地平又快。这样大家不但不反对她们，而且学习开她们了。表扬妇女、儿童，启发了青年人，如曹起山、要圪积说：“咱们就不能叫广播广播咱？”就起早搭黑的迎头赶上，在组内成了模范，并引起一、三组的挑战竞赛。
