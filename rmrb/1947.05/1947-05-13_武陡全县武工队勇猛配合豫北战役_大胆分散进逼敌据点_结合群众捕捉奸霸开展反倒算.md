The Wuqi County Armed Work Team Bravely Cooperates with the Northern Henan Campaign
    Boldly Dispersing to Press Enemy Strongholds
    Combining with the Masses to Capture Traitorous Tyrants and Carry Out Anti-Reckoning

[This newspaper, Wu Zhi News] In order to cooperate with the Northern Henan Campaign, all armed and unarmed personnel in Wuqi County have been adopting an active and bold forward-looking combat posture to besiege the enemy. After more than ten days of fierce offensive, they captured and forced the retreat of enemy and puppet strongholds such as Ningguo, Dongcun, Yuancun and Liwan. Our armed activities have spread to more than 95% of the villages in the county. More than 20 villages, which were controlled by the enemy before their major offensive last year, have contacted us and paid public grain. The footsteps of the armed work team members often tread near Wuqi City. In the battle of Pingling, more than 50 men from Zhao Derong's miscellaneous troops, except for more than 20 killed and wounded and those who deserted, only 14 scurried back, scaring the enemy so much that they did not dare to come out and disturb us for more than ten days. After this battle, the comrades of the Wang Cun Geng team established full confidence, saying: "In the future, we will fight even better than this time!" The Wang Dexin group broke into the enemy's rear and captured the big local tyrant Yang Shifa, scaring the fleeing local tyrants to contact our government one after another. Anti-reckoning elements in nearby villages kowtowed and apologized in the villages, returning the things they had wrongly taken from the masses. An old lady found Dexin and asked him to avenge her murdered son. Clearing out the villages around Dongxiaohong, they captured more than 50 big and small local tyrants hiding there, and held a mass meeting of 2,000 people on the spot. At the meeting, hearing the news of our army's victory, the masses spontaneously applauded and cheered several times. An old farmer in Beitiantang Village (only three li away from the enemy's stronghold) personally reported the situation to me and asked our army to eliminate the harm for the village. Sure enough, without firing a shot, the joint defense captain of five villages was captured alive, and two rifles were also seized. The head tyrant of Dongjie near Village strictly ordered the masses not to contact our army, which aroused collective resistance from the entire village, and unanimously vowed: "Whoever does not contact the Eighth Route Army is not born of a mother, let him (referring to the tyrant) shoot us all together!" After the struggle, the masses finally completely turned to us. The Yuan Zhenwen group, which was active in the Xiaogao Village area, repelled the attack of more than 50 enemies. After the people of Nanguanzhuang suppressed the tyrannical village head, they cared for our work team members kindly, and volunteered to select councilors to complete the task of storing grain as soon as possible. Yuancun wiped out the enemy's fortifications and blockhouses in one day.
    In the past month or so, only four armed work teams have fought more than 60 battles, killing and wounding 48 enemies, capturing 138 enemy puppet traitors and anti-reckoning elements, seizing one machine gun, sixteen rifles, 273 grenades, destroying 75 large and small blockhouses, destroying more than ten li of highways, and thirteen bridges.
    Due to the bold and dispersed forward expansion to besiege the enemy, most of the villages in the county are gradually stabilizing. Markets such as Xiaogao and Xiaodong have started to use Jichaopiao, and are beginning to prosper. The masses who had fled to other villages have returned to their hometowns one after another. Vigorous efforts have been made to capture the absconding anti-reckoning elements, so that the anti-reckoning movement is being carried out in more than 20 villages. The first batch of activists in each region have been trained. In XX Village, more than ten li away from the enemy stronghold in Muluan Village, the peasant association organization has been secretly restored, and the anti-reckoning struggle is underway. The masses shouted: "Take back our wheat fields!" (Qiu Hong)
