　　Men and Women Divided into Labor, Everyone Participates, Able-bodied Young People Join the Battle Without Delaying Sowing
    Changzhi Second and Fifth Districts Launch Crash Sowing of 120,000 Mu
    [Reported from Changzhi by Our Newspaper] After a large number of people from the Second District participated in the war and transported grain, in the situation of extreme labor shortage, the entire district's 34 villages launched a crash sowing of more than 44,000 mu of corn and more than 30,000 mu of millet, a total of more than 70,000 mu, accounting for about 74 percent of the district's autumn land, within eight days (May 1 to May 9). At the beginning of April, they went to northern Henan to participate in the war, and at the beginning of May, they transported grain voluntarily. A total of 4,700 laborers from the entire district went out twice, accounting for about 80 percent of the district's labor force. Under the condition of extreme labor shortage, they were still able to sow in a timely manner and complete the substitute farming for military families and war participants. The main experiences are: First, overcome the emotions of cadres and the masses who lack confidence in sowing in a timely manner, and go all out to crash sow. Villages such as Sudian, Jiaojiazhuang, and Xinyi all used accounting comparisons to realize that women can hold up half the sky. Some said: "How can you say that women are useless? Two or three of them are not as good as one man! Besides, old men and children can also do great things by planting and spreading manure." This improved everyone's confidence. Some villages even proposed slogans such as "Early sowing brings harvest every year, late sowing depends on the year." and "Better early than late, young and old work together," breaking the negative waiting mentality and launching a crash sowing campaign, thus reversing the mood and unfolding the crash sowing movement. Second, organize old men, women, and children to join the movement, doing whatever they can. According to incomplete statistics, nearly 7,000 women in the district participated in sowing, and more than 2,200 old men and children were organized according to their specific abilities, with men and women mixed. For example, in the plowing group, men hold the plow, and women and children drop seeds and spread manure; in the planting group, old men hold the hoe, and women and children drop seeds, spread manure, and cover the furrows. In Xiguxian, 75 women cultivated a total of 209 mu, averaging 0.4 mu per person per day. Women are responsible for milling rice, grinding flour, and grinding soybean cakes, without using livestock. This way, labor is allocated according to people and tasks, without wasting strong labor, and auxiliary labor can be utilized. Throughout the district, auxiliary labor production has become a movement. Third, the contradiction between participating in the war and production was resolved. Nantianhe, Sudian, and Xiguxian implemented a major change of work method that unifies war participation and production in calculating work points and unifying work tickets. Diligent workers are drawn according to the number of laborers in the mutual aid group, and substitute farming is adjusted by the mutual aid group, giving priority to sowing for military families and war participants before working for themselves. Encouraged by the victory on the front lines and the surplus grain in the rear, the masses created methods such as developing civilian strength, saving civilian strength, bearing more and topping more, and offsetting each other. In Xiguxian, carrying 50 jin for a round trip of 60 li counts as 10 points, and someone carrying 100 jin counts as two people. Last time, 55 people were supposed to go, but only 43 went. Nantianhe saved 11 laborers and planted 200 mu more of corn. The land was sown after returning from the war, so neither war participation nor sowing was delayed.

    [Also reported] After the Fifth District went through district and village cadres, activists, and middle peasant associations, under the slogan of "Winning both War Participation and Production" and "Participating in War and Production is Being a Hero, and There is Surplus Grain After Winning Battles," villages organized major changes in work between the front and the rear. Sowing began on May 1, and more than 50,000 mu have been sown within ten days, with more than 10,000 mu still to be sown, which will be completed in one or two days. (Xian Tang, Sheng Xiu, Kai Di)

　　男女分工人人动手青壮参战不误下种
    长治二、五两区突击种地十二万亩
    【本报长治讯】二区大批参战运粮走后，在劳力奇缺的情况下，八天内（五月一日至五月九日）全区卅四村突击下种玉茭四万四千余亩，谷三万余亩，共七万余亩，约占全区秋地百分之七十四。四月初去豫北参战，五月初义运粮食，两次全区共有四千七百个劳力出去，约占全区劳力百分之八十，在劳力奇缺条件下，仍能及时下种，并完成军属、参战户的代耕，主要经验有：一、及时克服干部群众没信心下种的情绪，全力突击下种。苏店、焦家庄、信义等村都用算账对比认识了妇女顶大事。有的说：“妇女怎说不顶用吧，两个三个还不顶一个男人！再说还有老汉、儿童点种撒粪都能顶大事。”这才提高了大家信心。有的村更提出：“早种年年收，迟种碰年头”。“赶早不赶晚，老小一齐干”等口号，打破消极等待思想，这样扭转情绪，展开突击下种运动。二、组织老汉、妇女、儿童卷入运动，能干啥干啥，据不完全统计：全区参加下种的妇女几达七千人，老汉、儿童二千二百余，按活具体组织，男女掺配。如犁地组男人掌犁，妇女、儿童溜籽点粪；点种组老汉掌锄，妇女、儿童点籽撒粪，盖圪道。西故县七十五个妇女，共＠地二百零九亩，平均每人每天攒四分。碾米、磨面、碾豆饼都是妇女，不用牲口，这样按人按活分工配备，不浪费强劳力，又能发挥辅助劳力的作用。就全区来说，辅助劳力生产已成运动。三、解决了参战与生产的矛盾，南天河、苏店、西故县实行了参战生产统一计工，统一工票的大变工办法，按互助组劳力多少抽拨勤工，又按互助组调剂代耕，都是给军属、参战人先下种，再给自己干。在前方打胜仗，后方有余粮的鼓舞下，群众创造出发扬民力，节省民力，多担多顶分，互相折并等办法。西故县是担五十斤，往返六十里顶十分，有人担一百斤顶两个人，上次该去五十五个，去了四十三个。南天河节省了十一个劳力，多种了二百亩玉茭，参战回来地都下种，这样不误参战，也不误下种。（行夫、福田、志兴、林堂、汉清）
    【又讯】五区经区村干部、积极分子、中农会后，在“参战生产两胜利”，“参战生产当英雄，打了胜仗有余粮”口号下，村村组织了前后方大变工。五月一号开始下种，在十天内已下种五万余亩，还有未下种的一万余亩，一、二日即可全部完成。（先堂、生秀、开第）
