　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th. Comprehensive reports: Following the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference, American imperialism is frantically pursuing its expansionist policies with lightning speed towards countries such as Mexico, Argentina, Hungary, Poland, Italy, Austria, Greece, Turkey, Syria, Nepal, and Siam, using all sorts of methods, in a desperate attempt to escape the impending economic crisis. On May 1st, Truman and Mexican President Alemán discussed so-called US-Mexico economic "cooperation" in the United States and jointly announced a plan whereby the United States would use loans to Mexico to "stabilize" the exchange rate between the Mexican peso and the US dollar, so that the US dollar could completely control the Mexican currency. Under the guise of "cooperation," Mexico's finances would be forced to swallow more doses of aggressive poison in "many important aspects." On the 5th, the head of the US Civil Aeronautics Administration announced that the US-Argentina aviation agreement had been signed. The US House of Representatives also recently passed a bill to "aid" Poland, Italy, Hungary, Greece, Austria, and China (the Chiang government) with $300 million after the UN ends its relief efforts. Many congressmen opposed this policy of using "relief" for expansion, and as many as 66 votes were cast against it during the vote. The US "aid" bill for Turkey and Greece was also passed by the House of Representatives on the 25th of last month. In the Middle East, the US State Department announced on the 28th of last month that the United States and Syria had signed an air transport agreement, granting the aircraft of the US "Pan American Airlines" the right to land in Damascus, Syria, on routes between the United States and India. A group of American oil experts are currently conducting surveys in the areas of Adana, Mersin, Alexandretta, and Kazan in Turkey, which exposes one of the important purposes of American imperialism's aid to Turkey: to seize oil. In the Far East, the Siam "Pacific Airlines," controlled by American monopoly capital, has recently opened a US-Siam air route. American imperialism is also expanding into Nepal, a small country in the foothills of the Himalayas, and signed the so-called US-Nepal "Friendship and Commerce Agreement" on the 25th of last month, excluding Britain's long-standing interests there.
　　
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th. TASS, Ottawa: Richard, a representative of the Manitoba Province in the Canadian Legislative Assembly, recently sharply criticized American foreign policy. Richard pointed out that American imperialists are hiding behind aid to Greece, Turkey, and China to implement their expansionist policies. He also said that the United States is trying to expand its military power in order to seize world markets for capitalists and escape the arrival of an economic crisis.

　　妄图逃避即将到来的经济危机
    美国疯狂进行扩张政策
    魔爪伸向南美欧陆中东远东
    【新华社陕北七日电】综合报导：莫斯科外长会议以后，美帝国主义对墨西哥、阿根廷、匈牙利、波兰、意大利、奥地利、希腊、土耳其、叙利亚、尼泊尔、暹罗等国用种种方法急如星火地进行其扩张政策，亟图逃避行将到来的经济危机。本月一日杜鲁门与墨西哥总统阿尔曼在美谈商所谓美墨经济“合作”，并共同发表计划，美国将利用对墨贷款“稳定”墨币“披沙”与美元的汇率，以使美元得以完全控制墨币，并在“合作”的糖衣下，使墨西哥财经的“许多重要方面”服下更多的侵略毒药。五日美民航局长宣布，美国与阿根廷航空协定业已签订。美众议院亦于最近通过了在联总结束后，美国以三万万美元“救济”波、意、匈、希、奥与中国（蒋政府）的议案。此种利用“救济”进行扩张的政策，不少众议员曾加反对，在投票表决时，反对票达六十六票之多。美国“援助”土希案亦于上月二十五日在众院通过。在中东方面，美国务院宣布上月二十八日美国与叙利亚签订了一个空运协定，美国的“泛美航空公司”飞机在美印航程中有权于叙利亚之大马士革降落。一批美国石油专家最近正在土耳其的亚达那、美尔星那、亚历山大勒达、喀赞等地区进行勘察，这暴露了美帝国主义援助土耳其重要目的之一，原来是为了攫取石油。在远东方面，美国独占资本控制的暹罗“太平洋航空公司”顷已开辟美暹航线，美帝国主义并向希马拉雅山麓的小国尼泊尔进行扩张，于上月二十五日签订了所谓美尼“友好商业协定”，对于英国一向在此的利益加以排斥。
    【新华社陕北七日电】塔斯社渥太华讯：加拿大立法会议曼尼托巴省代表李查士顷尖锐抨击美国外交政策。李查士指出：美帝国主义分子隐藏在援助希腊、土耳其与中国之背后，以实行其扩张政策。并谓美国力图扩张军事力量，以期为资本家夺取世界市场，逃避经济危机的降临。
