　　Villagers in a Certain Village in Huixian
    Treat the Wounded Like Family
    [Report from Huixian by Our Newspaper] Huixian County, known for its good relations between the Party, government, army, and people, has once again been praised by the Taihang Field Hygiene Department for its care of the wounded and its proactive assistance to the wounded soldiers' hospital in solving difficulties. When it was decided to set up a wounded soldiers' hospital in ×× village, the county government immediately appointed Yang Juemin, a section chief, the district head of the district, a financial and grain clerk, and the cadres of ×× village to form an office specifically to supply the hospital. It was decided that the village would not undertake any other duties but would focus on helping the hospital chop firewood, carry water, wash blood-stained clothes and bandages, and care for the wounded. Women from various villages and male and female students from various schools also voluntarily formed nursing teams to take turns caring for patients in the hospital. The masses who came to express their condolences every day were like shuttles, wearing new clothes and bringing all kinds of rare things. One day, the number of eggs personally delivered to the wounded reached more than five thousand. Comrade Yang Juemin's care for the wounded was meticulous, from food, drink, clothing, and bedding to the length and height of the beds. When the hospital ran out of eggs, he sent people to collect them from forty or fifty miles away, and he personally went to Bobi, dozens of miles away, to buy glutinous rice to make rice cakes for the wounded and improve their lives. Feeling that the lives of the wounded were too dull, he organized six opera troupes to perform near the hospital for five or six days, and together with County Head Xu, he brought more than 400 towels and 400-500 cans of milk, distributing them to the wounded one by one.

    [Report by Our Newspaper] The front-line rescue work in northern Henan has been well received by all parties. Minister Gui of the Taihang Field Hygiene Department personally led a surgical team to perform operations near the front line, saving many wounded soldiers from danger. During the Huixian battle, the surgical team worked at the operating table for a day and a night, eating only one meal. When they were notified to depart, they were still standing in front of the operating table, but they did not do things perfunctorily, and they insisted on completing the operation before catching up with the troops. During the movement, they were afraid that the wounded would not be able to find their location, so they set up special signs on the road during the day, and they took turns guarding the intersections at night. After arriving at the destination, the nurses and orderlies put down their belongings and built sheds and disinfected the houses. There were several times when they had just finished and were about to leave, but they had no complaints. The hospital had few people and lacked medicines and equipment, but because everyone had high work enthusiasm and studied new treatment methods, the discharge time of the wounded soldiers was advanced by six or seven times.

　　辉县某村群众
    招呼伤员亲如家人
    【本报辉县讯】素以党政军民关系良好著称的辉县，这次在看护伤员与主动帮助伤兵医院解决困难上，又得太行野战卫生部称赞。当决定在××村设伤兵医院时，县府即指定一科长杨觉民、该区区长与一位财粮科员及××庄干部合组办公室，专事对医院供给。并决定该村不出任何差务，专门帮助医院劈柴、担水、洗血衣、绷带，看护伤员，各村妇女、各校男女学生，也自动组成看护队，轮替在院内看护。每日前来慰问的群众，如穿梭一样，他们穿着新衣服，拿着各种稀罕东西；有一天，仅亲自送给伤员的鸡子即达五千以上。杨觉民同志对伤员的照关，从吃喝穿戴与床铺长短高低，简直无微不至。医院没鸡蛋，他派人到四、五十里以外把鸡子收来，又亲自到数十里以外的薄璧购买糯米，为伤员做粽糕，改善生活，他觉得伤员生活太闷，就组织了六个剧团在医院附近出演了五、六天，并与徐县长带了四百多条毛巾和四五百筒牛奶，一个挨一个发给伤员。

    【本报讯】豫北前线救护工作，颇得各方好评。太行野战卫生部桂部长亲率手术组在火线附近施行手术，使许多伤员免于生命危险。辉县战役时，手术组在手术台边忙了一天一夜，只吃了一餐。当通知出发的时候，他们还站在手术台前，但他们并没有了草从事，一直坚持到手术完成后才追赶部队。行动时，怕伤员找不到他们的所在，白天就在路上设特别标志，夜晚则在交岔路上轮替站岗。到目的地后，看护伤员放下东西就搭棚，刷房子消毒。有几次刚搞好又出发，但他们没有任何怨言。医院人少，药品器械又缺乏，但因大家工作热情高，对新治疗法有研究，伤兵出院时间提早了六、七倍。
