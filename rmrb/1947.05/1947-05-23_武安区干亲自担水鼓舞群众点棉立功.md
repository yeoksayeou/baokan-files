　　[This report from Wu'an] The struggle against drought by carrying water to plant cotton in Wu'an is being carried out under the slogans "Rush to plant and rush to harvest, no planting, no harvesting," "Carrying water to plant cotton, people can overcome nature," and "Break superstition and don't rely on heaven, clothing and food depend on ourselves." Cadres are personally taking action, heroes and model workers are taking the lead, and a competition is being launched to encourage everyone to plant. All district cadres in the Chengguan district are personally participating in carrying water to plant cotton. Cadre Bai Xiyue had never carried heavy loads on his shoulders before, but this time his shoulders were rubbed raw. He still persevered and kept working, taking breaks and then continuing. He said that even if his skin was a little sore, he was still happy in his heart, and if it was swollen, he would exercise it. Jia Dekui and Wei Wenzhang, model water carriers in Chengguan's 13th Street, both carry two buckets on each shoulder, which has further motivated everyone. Wang Fenglin, a military dependent in 5th Street, challenged Zhi Yong. In one afternoon, the two of them carried more than 160 loads of water and planted three mu of cotton, which further encouraged all the masses in 5th Street to learn from them. Gangtou, Xizhuangcheng, and Dujiazhuang in the 10th district are organizing all laborers, as well as women and children, for a concentrated effort. Each of these villages can plant more than 20 mu per day. Jin Baoshun (age 13), a child hero from Xikongbi Village, carried 47 loads of water. Hejiazhuang pays attention to technology in cotton planting, putting forward the slogan: "Plant one mu, succeed one mu, plant more, ensure more survive," and first plant for the war participants. At the same time, they are organizing letters to the front lines, reporting on the production situation at home, and launching a campaign for meritorious service at the front and rear. In Maqushui, 7th District, a total of 13 laborers have each planted an average of 1.3 mu. Planting has already begun in Yangyi's two streets. The 4th, 9th, and 6th districts are also working hard recently. In the work of carrying water to plant cotton, in addition to calling for and commending the struggle against drought in 1942 and 1943 and resolving issues such as high wages, excessive delays in planting, expensive grain prices, and cheap cotton prices, some places are also adjusting land closer to water sources to seek more cotton planting: (1) In Wucheng and other villages, a lease form is used, with a 30/70 split after the autumn harvest, with the laborer receiving 70% and the owner receiving 30%, and the burden being borne by the owner of the land. (2) Baoziyu, Yangyi, and other places are using equal output and equal distance to exchange land. (3) The planter is responsible for giving the landowner an equal amount of grain after the autumn harvest.

　　[This report from Wu'an] He Village in the 10th district responded to the call to carry water and plant cotton. Village cadres and militia members participated in mutual aid and leadership on the ground. One person was left in each group to cook, and all other women went to the fields to plant cotton. Shen Zixiang, deputy director of the agricultural association, challenged the whole group to carry water. He did not rest on the ground and carried seven or eight more loads than others in half a day, which motivated the whole group to not rest. From the 11th to the 13th, the whole village planted a total of 78 mu of cotton.

　　[This report from Wu'an] In Tian Erzhuang in the 9th district, the masses' thinking was cleared by the painful facts of drought and famine from their own experience. From the 17th, all the full and semi-laborers at home were organized into mutual aid groups for cotton planting. There were 15 full laborers and more than 40 semi-laborers, divided into four groups, and they first planted for the military, martyrs, and workers' families. Their method is exchanging labor and recording labor (8 jin of rice per work point), which improved labor efficiency. The masses' enthusiasm is high, and they planted 15 mu in one day on the 19th.

　　武安区干亲自担水鼓舞群众点棉立功
    【本报武安讯】武安担水种棉抗旱斗争，正在“抢种抢收，不种不收”，“担水种棉，人能胜天”，“打破迷信不靠天，穿衣吃饭靠自己”口号下，由干部亲自动手，英雄模范带头，开展互相比赛，个个加油的点种运动。城关区所有区干部都亲自参加担水点种，干部白喜月肩膀头上从没放过重担，这次肩膀磨肿了，仍坚决拧着劲，歇歇又干，并说肉皮疼点，心里总是高兴，肿了再锻炼锻炼就好了。城关十三街担水模范贾德魁、魏文章都是一挑两担，更推动了大家。五街军属王凤林提出给智用的挑战，一后晌两人担水一百六十余担，种了棉花三亩，更鼓舞了五街所有群众，都要向他二人学习。十区岗头，西庄城、杜家庄都在组织所有劳力及妇女、儿童突击，每天这些村都可种到廿亩以上。西孔璧村并出现担水四十七担的儿童英雄靳保顺（年十三）。何家庄种棉讲究技术，提出口号：种一亩，成一亩，种的多，要保证活的多，并先给参战人员点种。同时正组织写信给前方，报告家里生产情形，开展前后方立功运动。七区马渠水共十三个劳力，每人平均已种一亩三分，阳邑两街已开始点种。四、九、六区近来也正在加油。在担水点种上，除号召表扬四二、四三年向旱灾斗争及解决工资高、点种误工太多、粮价贵、花价贱等思想外，有些地方并实行调剂离水近的地，求得多植棉：（一）武城等村用出租形式，秋后三七分红，劳七主三，负担由地的主人出。（二）豹子峪、阳邑等用产量相等、远近相等来兑换。（三）由种地人负责，秋后给土地所有人相等产量的粮食。

    【本报武安讯】十区和村响应担水点花号召，村干部、民兵参加互助下地领导，每组留一个做饭，其余妇女一律到地种花，副农会主任申子祥向全组挑战担水，他自己到地不休息，半天就比别人多担七、八担，这样推动全组都不休息。从十一日起到十三日全村共种花七十八亩。

    【本报武安讯】九区田二庄用群众亲身经历的旱荒痛苦事实打通了群众思想，十七日起把在家的全半劳力组织了点棉互助组，全劳力十五个，半劳力四十余个，分了四组，先给军、烈、工属点种。他们办法是换工和记工（每工八斤米），这样就提高了劳动效率。群众情绪很高，十九日一天就点了十五亩。
