　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 1st Dispatch: The Northeast Democratic Youth League, possessing over three thousand members, is gradually growing into a mass organization uniting the broad masses of outstanding youth in the Northeast Liberated Area. Since August of last year, the League's membership has increased from 170 to over 3,000. They have participated in practical work such as repatriating Japanese expatriates,慰问democratic united army, protesting American military atrocities, and going to the countryside to participate in land reform. They have transformed and tempered their thinking, closely integrated with workers, peasants, and soldiers, and laid the foundation for the future Northeast democratic youth movement. In particular, in January of this year, the Harbin "Minqing" headquarters organized middle and high school students from Songjiang, Harbin, and Dadao to form winter vacation work teams, which departed in three batches to villages and hamlets outside Harbin to lead and help peasants to free themselves. They personally witnessed the suffering of poor peasants from feudal exploitation, the steadfastness of the masses' struggle, and the moving deeds of the Democratic United Army in the self-defense war, which further brought their thoughts and feelings closer to the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Even a student surnamed Wu from the Provincial No. 1 Middle School, who had been deceived by the Kuomintang special agent "Sanqing"团员in the past, said: "Now I am not only unafraid of being 'labeled' (meaning 'left-leaning,' a term used by Kuomintang special agents to intimidate youth), but I will also carry it through to the end." Currently, the influence of "Minqing" is rapidly expanding. For example, the Harbin No. 2 Middle School Student Self-Government Association was previously controlled by reactionaries. Now the "Minqing" in the school enjoys high prestige among the students, and the membership has increased from 40 to 180. Thirty Kuomintang special agent "Sanqing Tuan" members in the school frankly admitted their mistakes. Now, "Minqing" members in Harbin are using their spare time to carry out social services and launch the little teacher movement. The Municipal Girls' Middle School alone has established 14 children's schools, enrolling more than 1,300 out-of-school children in the city.

　　东北民主青年同盟
    团结广大青年  与工农兵结合
    【新华社东北一日电】拥有三千余盟员的东北民主青年同盟，正逐渐壮大成为团结东北解放区广大优秀青年的一个群众性组织。该盟自去年八月迄今，盟员由一百七十名增至三千余名，他们曾经参加遣送日侨、慰问民主联军、抗议美军暴行、下乡参加土地改革等实际工作，改造与锻炼了自己的思想，密切的与工农兵结合起来，奠定了今后东北民主青年运动的基础。特别是今年一月间，哈市“民青”总部组织松、哈大、中学生成立寒假下乡工作队，先后三批出发哈市郊外各村屯，领导帮助农民翻身。他们亲眼看到贫苦农民被封建剥削的痛苦，群众斗争的坚定，及民主联军在自卫战争中可歌可泣的事实，使他们的思想感情更进一步接近了工农兵。连省立一中过去曾受蒋特“三青”团员欺骗的学生吴某也说：“我现在不但不怕‘挂色’（意指‘左倾’，蒋特用以恐吓青年的用语）了，而且还要干到底。”现“民青”的影响，正在迅速扩大，如哈市二中学生自治会，过去曾为反动分子所掌握，现该校“民青”在学生中威信很高，盟员由四十人增至一百八十人，校中三十名蒋特“三青团员”坦白承认了自己的错误。现在哈市“民青”盟员，正利用课余时间，进行社会服务，展开小先生运动；仅市立女中就成立了儿童学校十四所，收容全市失学儿童一千三百余人入学。
