　　Taiwan Soldier Chen Guoying Honorably Accepted into the Party
    [Report from the Henan-North Hubei Front, May 6th] Taiwan soldier Chen Guoying has recently been approved for Party membership by the Party Committee of the "Tiger" Character Unit, becoming the first glorious Taiwan Communist Party member in General Liu Bocheng's People's Liberation Army. He is nineteen years old and his family home is in Yangmei Township, Hsinchu, Taiwan. His family is poor, and his father is a worker in a tea factory in Taipei. After the Japanese surrender, he was forced to join Chiang's army's 140th Brigade, which had just arrived in Taiwan. When the brigade left Taiwan to go to the civil war battlefield, his disappointment with Chiang Kai-shek turned into resentment. In January of this year, he was liberated in the Battle of Tanglou, west of Yutai. After joining the People's Liberation Army, he received even warmer love and mutual assistance from comrades. Witnessing the liberated areas where peasants had obtained land and the close relationship between the people's army and the people, as well as the moving scenes of liberated peasants from various places voluntarily signing up to join the army, he gradually understood the bright happiness of the people in the liberated areas. Later, through the "speak bitterness" movement for liberated soldiers, he gained a deeper understanding of Chiang Kai-shek's crimes. From then on, he had a further understanding of the Party and the revolution, and his work and study became more active. When the unit moved west to mobilize against tanks, he was the first to sign up, and he was brave and firm in battle. (Wu Xiang)

　　台籍战士陈国英光荣被接受入党
    【本报豫北前线六日电】台湾战士陈国英，顷被虎字部队党委批准入党，成为刘伯承将军所部人民解放军中第一名光荣的台湾籍共产党员。他现年十九岁，祖居台湾新竹杨梅镇。家贫，父为台北茶工厂工人。日寇投降，他被迫参加抵台不久之蒋军一四○旅，该旅离台开赴内战战场时，他对蒋介石遂由失望而成愤恨。今年一月，他于鱼台西汤楼战斗中被解放。参加解放军后，受到同志间更热烈的友爱互助。目睹获得了土地的农民解放区和人民军队亲如家人，及各地翻身农民自动报名参军的动人情景，逐渐了解解放区人民的光明幸福；后又经过解放战士诉苦运动，他对蒋介石的罪恶获得进一步认识。从此他对党对革命有了进一步的认识，工作学习更加积极。部队西进时动员打坦克，他首先报名，战斗中英勇坚定。（吴象）
