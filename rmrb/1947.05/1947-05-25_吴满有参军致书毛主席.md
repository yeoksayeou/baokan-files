Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd: The famous labor hero Wu Manyou has voluntarily joined the army at the front lines and has written a letter to his close friend, Chairman Mao Zedong. The original letter is as follows:

Chairman Mao: Since the traitor Hu Zongnan attacked our border region and occupied Yan'an, the mountains and valleys are filled with soldiers. The ten years of peaceful life in the border region have been destroyed. The cattle have been slaughtered and eaten, the donkeys have been driven away, the grain has been ruined, and the women have been raped and killed. But we are not afraid! Because our army has fought several great victories, and the people have also taken action. Furthermore, we have heard that you are still in the border region, sharing weal and woe with our people and leading the self-defense war. Our confidence is even higher.

Now, the liberated areas across the country are winning victories, eliminating the traitor Chiang Kai-shek's army. The people of our border region must rise up and join the army to eliminate Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan as soon as possible, recover Yan'an, and fight to Xi'an so that we can have a good life.

I am fifty-four years old this year, and I am not willing to only join the stretcher team or the militia. I have already signed up at the victory celebration meeting the other day. Now I have arrived in our ranks; I have put on my uniform and picked up my gun. I also want to actively mobilize and organize the people to join the militia and guerrillas, and to join the regular army. All the young people in the border region should quickly join the army. If everyone takes action, we can quickly eliminate Hu Zongnan, that evil breed. Old Wu is determined to wipe out the traitors Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan completely, and then become a labor hero again.

The traitors Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan have destroyed the good, peaceful and democratic life in the border region. Hu Zongnan opened up the road he came by, but did not open up the road he will leave by. Under your leadership and the command of Deputy Commander Peng, we are even more confident that we will wipe out the enemy completely, and not let a single one of them escape. We will surely be victorious! Wishing you good health!

　　吴满有参军致书毛主席
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】著名劳动英雄吴满有已在前线自动参军。并写信给其亲密友人毛泽东主席。原信如下：
    毛主席：自从卖国贼胡宗南打到咱边区，占了咱延安，山山＠＠尽是兵，边区十年和平光景给破坏了，牛都杀吃了，驴都赶走了，粮食糟踏完了，妇女奸淫死了，但是咱都不怕！因为有咱军队打了几次大胜仗，人民也都动起手来，又听说你还在边区与咱老百姓共甘苦，领导自卫战争，咱的信心越发高了。
    现在全国解放区都打胜仗，消灭蒋介石卖国贼的军队，咱边区人民都要起来参军，早早儿把蒋介石、胡宗南消灭个干干净净。收复延安，打到西安去，才有好光景。
    咱今年五十四岁了，咱还不甘心只参加担架队、民兵，咱已经在那天庆祝胜利大会上报了名，现在咱已到了咱的队伍里；已经穿上了军装，拿起了枪；咱还要好好动员组织人民参加民兵和游击队，参加正规军；全边区青年人都应该快快参军，大家动手就能快快把胡宗南坏种消灭掉，咱老吴决心把卖国贼蒋介石胡宗南消灭个干净，再来当劳动英雄。
    卖国贼蒋介石胡宗南破坏了边区和平民主的好光景，胡宗南来的路开下了，走的路没开下，在你的领导和彭副总司令的指挥下，咱更有信心一定把敌人消灭干净，一个也不让他出去，咱们一定就要胜利的！敬祝健康！
     吴满有十八日
