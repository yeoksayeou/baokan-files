　　Our Army in Northern Henan Recaptures Tangyin
    Sun Dianying and Liu Yueting Captured Alive
    All of Traitor Sun's Provisional 3rd Column Annihilated
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Henan, Urgent Telegram, 2nd] The People's Liberation Army in Northern Henan captured Tangyin, annihilated the entire Chiang Kai-shek puppet 3rd Column, and captured alive the column commander, traitor Sun Dianying. At 10:00 PM on the 1st, a unit of the People's Liberation Army in Northern Henan launched a general attack on Tangyin. After six hours of fierce fighting, the entire enemy Chiang Kai-shek puppet Provisional 3rd Column under Sun Dianying was annihilated without a single escapee. Sun Dianying, his deputy commander Liu Yueting, chief of staff Deng Fuxuan, and others were all captured alive.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Henan Front, 1st] After Wang Zhonglian's troops were annihilated by our forces at Yigou, suffering more than 13,000 casualties, the remnants fled south to Jixian and Xinxiang. They then gathered the remaining defeated troops and transferred the 175th Brigade of the 38th Division from the Daoqing Railway Line, and the 64th Brigade of the 15th Division from Henan (Note: the 135th Brigade of this division was recently annihilated in northern Shaanxi). Starting from April 29th, they launched a second northward attack from Jixian city and Jixian Railway Station along the Pinghan Railway and on both sides of it. At 11:00 AM on the 30th, the vanguard advanced to the Nanyang-Shisanlibao (12 li south of Qixian) line, where they were met with a powerful counterattack, suffering heavy casualties, and fled back to Jixian city in panic that afternoon. Another route, the remnants of the 13th Brigade of the 66th Division, advanced northwest from Ganzhuang (10+ li north of Jixian), and at 12:00 noon were fiercely counterattacked near Wang'erzhuang, suffering more than 100 casualties, and also fled back to Jixian city in a state of disarray. Another group of enemies, about one regiment, attacking Manliu (18 li northwest of Jixian), were also counterattacked by us at the same time and fled back to Jixian Railway Station.
    [Our Newspaper, Northern Henan Front, 1st] According to Li Deshen, a soldier of the 53rd Regiment of the 199th Brigade of the Chiang Kai-shek army's 66th Division captured in the battle north of Jixian: the morale of the division is low, and they have no confidence in fighting the People's Liberation Army, and many are fleeing. When departing north, the division commander, Song Ruike, told his soldiers, "When we get to the north bank of the Yellow River, our units are often completely annihilated by the enemy. We must be careful. We must dig fortifications first wherever we go, conserve ammunition, and conduct thorough reconnaissance." One day, the division (the 13th and 199th Brigades) crossed the Yellow River, and lower-level officers and soldiers all tore off their cap badges, shoulder straps, and symbols, preparing to be captured. Later, the superiors discovered this and forced them to put these things back on. Lower-level officers often secretly asked the Chiang Kai-shek soldiers released by us, "Is it true that you are not killed but treated favorably after being captured by the Eighth Route Army?" The lower-level officers and soldiers of the division all regard crossing the Yellow River as a dead end, resulting in a large number of desertions. One squad deserted completely under the leadership of the squad leader. The special service company of the 199th Brigade lost 110 men on the day it departed from Huayuan Railway Station, leaving only eight soldiers in the entire company. The division headquarters, fearing that the soldiers would desert, did not pay them for two months and held roll call twice a day, but still could not stop the desertion phenomenon. The soldiers are not fed enough every day, the discipline is very bad, and all the chickens and pigs in the villages they pass through are eaten. When the division fought in northern Qi (county), it ignored the encirclement and annihilation of the Chiang Kai-shek Second Rapid Column and fled in a panic, but its 596th Regiment of the 199th Brigade was still completely annihilated by the Liberation Army during the escape. The Chiang Kai-shek army's 66th Division was originally stationed in the Baokang and Xingshan areas of Hubei. At the end of March, the 13th and 199th Brigades of the division were ordered to be transferred north to Xuzhou to reinforce Shandong; when they reached Zhengzhou, because Xinxiang was in a tight situation, they were transferred north in a hurry in an attempt to save the critical situation in northern Henan, but the result was still a disastrous defeat.
    [Our Newspaper, Northern Henan Front, 30th] According to Chiang Kai-shek soldiers of the 66th Division who were captured: Before the 66th Division crossed the Yellow River to the north, the division headquarters ordered all officers above the platoon level to remove their cap flowers, remove their symbols, and change into soldiers' clothing. Officers above the company commander level were replaced with numbers instead of directly calling their rank. Platoon leaders were all called "sir" to avoid revealing their identity after being captured. When they entered the pocket of the Liberation Army, the division headquarters mistakenly believed that the "Communist army was collapsing" and triumphantly ordered the restoration of the original clothing and titles. Unexpectedly, they had just changed their clothes when they were annihilated in the battle of Junxian.

　　豫北我军收复汤阴
    活捉孙殿英刘月亭
    孙逆暂编第三纵队全部被歼
    【新华社豫北二日急电】豫北人民解放军攻克汤阴，歼灭蒋伪第三纵队全部，生擒纵队司令孙逆殿英。一日晚十时，豫北人民解放军一部向汤阴发动总攻，经六小时激烈战斗，将守敌蒋伪暂编第三纵队孙殿英部全部歼灭，无一漏网，孙殿英及其副司令刘月亭，参谋长邓甫暄等均被生擒。
    【新华社豫北前线一日电】王仲廉部在宜沟被我歼灭一万三千余人，残部南窜汲县新乡后，又收集残丘败将并由道清线上调来三八师之一七五旅，由河南调来整十五师之六四旅（按：该师一三五旅近在陕北被歼），从四月二十九日开始，由汲县城及汲县车站沿平汉铁路及其两侧第二次北犯。三十日十一时，先头进至南阳、十三里堡（淇县南十二里）之线，遭我有力阻击，伤亡惨重，当日下午即仓惶窜回汲县城。另一路六六师十三旅残部，由甘庄（汲县北十余里）向西北进犯，十二时在王二庄附近遭我猛烈反击，伤亡百余名，亦狼狈回窜汲县城。另一路犯漫流（汲县西北十八里）之敌约一个团，同时遭我反击，窜回汲县车站。
    【本报豫北前线一日电】据在汲县以北战斗中被俘之蒋军六六师一九九旅五十三团士兵李德神称：该师士气低落，对人民解放军作战都无信心，纷纷逃亡。北调出发时，该师师长宋瑞珂对其士兵讲话说：“到黄河北岸，我们部队常全部被敌人消灭，我们要注意，每到一地要先挖工事，节约子弹，严密搜索侦察”。一日该师（十三、一九九两旅）渡过黄河，下级军官及士兵均将帽徽、肩章、及符号撕掉，准备当俘虏。后上级军官发觉，又强令将这些东西重新戴上。下级军官常偷偷的向被我释放之蒋军士兵说：“被八路军捉住后，当真不杀反受优待吗？”该师下级军官及士兵均把过黄河看作死路一条，形成大批逃亡现象。有一个班在班长率领下全班逃光。一九九旅特务连从花园车站出发之一天内，即跑掉一百一十个人，全连只剩了八个兵。师部怕战士逃亡，两个月不发饷，每天点名两次，仍不能阻止逃亡现象。士兵每天吃不饱，纪律极坏，所过村庄，鸡猪全部吃光。该师在淇（县）北战斗时，不顾蒋军第二快速纵队之被围歼，仓惶偷跑，但其一九九旅五九六团仍在逃跑的中途被解放军全部歼灭。按蒋军六六师原分驻湖北保康兴山一带。三月底，该师十三、一九九两旅奉命北调徐州，增援山东；行至郑州，因新乡吃紧，仓惶北调，以图挽救豫北危局，结果仍遭惨败。
    【本报豫北前线三十日电】据被俘的蒋军六十六师士兵谈：六十六师北渡黄河前，师部下令排以上官长一律摘掉帽花，去了符号，换成士兵衣着，连长以上官长均以号码代替，不能直呼其官衔，排长则一律称为“先生”，以免被俘后发现其身份。及至进入解放军口袋中，糊糊涂涂的尚未发现解放军时，师部竟以为“共军溃退”，得意忘形的又下令恢复原来服装称呼。谁知不巧得很，刚换过衣服，在浚县一战就被歼灭了。
