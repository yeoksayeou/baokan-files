Little Changsuo Delivers Grain
    Zilin
    On the front line of Tangyin, during the battle of Hebi, the masses mobilized to deliver grain to the army. In Xiaoyu Village, a nine-year-old child named Zhao Changsuo was lying on the kang, awake, when his mother returned from a village meeting at night. As soon as she came back, Zhao Changsuo asked:
    "What was the meeting about, Mom!"
    "They called for carrying public grain. The worker said that there were few animals, and there was not enough grain to transport for the army to eat; the young and strong men have all gone with the troops, so they are calling on women and children to deliver public grain."
    "I'll go too."
    "Child, we won't go. Your dad joined the army, let them deliver the grain."
    "No, I want to go too."
    "The village chief won't let you go."
    Little Changsuo didn't say anything, immediately climbed out of the quilt, put on his clothes, and ran out in a hurry, all the way to the village chief's place.
    After a while, he came back smiling and said: "Mom, you're teasing me." His mother didn't say anything more and went to sleep.
    At daybreak, Little Changsuo was awakened by the sound of gongs. Still in the quilt, he heard people shouting outside: "Take your bags to the warehouse to fill them with grain!"
    Changsuo quickly got up and asked his mother for a bag, but his mother wouldn't give it to him. Little Changsuo looked around, climbed onto a stool, and took down the lunch bag his dad had left at home.
    He felt that one lunch bag wasn't enough, so he borrowed another one from the village chief. He filled both lunch bags to the brim, hung them on his shoulders, and hurried home to eat.
    After eating, Changsuo asked his mother for dry food to take on the road. His mother said: "Child, you are still young, the round trip is thirty to forty li, you can't go. - I won't give you dry food either."
    After a while, the sound of gongs rang again. Changsuo found a way to get two bags full of persimmon cakes to take as dry food on the road, and then he went to join the grain transport team.
    As he left, he made up a song for his mother, singing as he walked:
    "Old mother, old mother, you are not good, there's fighting at the front, you don't want us to deliver public grain, do you want my dad to starve to death?"
    His mother glared at the child with a smile, and then followed the group to see him off.

　　小长锁送粮
    子林
    在汤阴前线上，有一次在打鹤壁战斗中，群众纷纷动员起来给军队送粮。在小峪村，有一个九岁的儿童赵长锁，夜里他娘在村里开会回来，赵长锁躺在炕上没有睡着，等他娘一回来就问：
    “开啥会哩？娘！”
    “叫背公粮哩。工作员说，牲口少，运粮不够军队吃；青壮年都跟部队去了，叫妇女儿童送公粮哩。”
    “我也去哩。”
    “孩子，咱不去，你爹参军了，叫他们给送粮吧。”
    “不，我也要去。”
    “村长不叫你去。”
    小长锁于是一声不响，立刻从被窝里爬起来，穿上衣服，就急急地跑出去了，一直跑到村长那里。
    一会，他回来笑着说：“娘，你哄俺。”他娘再不说什么就睡了。
    天一亮，小长锁被打锣声惊醒，还在被窝里就听到外面在叫唤着：“拿口袋到仓库去灌粮啊！”
    长锁赶忙爬起来，向娘要口袋，娘不给。小长锁向四下看了看，上到凳子上，把爹放在家的饭包拿下来。
    他觉得一个饭包不够用，又给村长借了一个，到仓库里装了鼓鼓地两饭包，挂在两肩上，也就匆匆忙忙跑回家吃饭去了。
    吃过饭，长锁给娘要干粮带到路上吃。娘说：“孩子，你还小，来回三四十里，可不能去。——我也不给你干粮。”
    一会，锣声又响了，长锁在家里设法拿了满满地两口袋柿饼在路上作干粮，于是就到运粮队里集合了。
    临走时，他给他娘编了个歌，一边走一边念着：
    “老娘老娘你不在行，前方打仗，你不叫送公粮，饿死俺爹你想不想？”
    娘向孩子笑着瞪了一眼，就跟着大队送他走了。
