　　Cutting Rails
    Two or Three Things About the Workers' Guerrilla Unit Ahead of Jiaozuo
    "These people are really capable!" This was what the masses and passers-by in Chadian Village in the border area said when the track was being cut. Here are a few things that happened at that time:
  1. Everyone Was Afraid to Watch
    To cut the railroad, one end of the rail had to be pried under a railroad structure with considerable pressure, while the other end was pressed down by manpower. The rail being pried up was more than a person tall, so everyone was afraid to watch. Comrade Li Yuming, who was in charge of cutting the rail, also admitted that getting on the rail was a dangerous thing. Comrade Bai Yuhua went up twice and didn't dare to go up again. Indeed, it was very dangerous. If too few people went up, not only would the rail not break, but the people would be thrown to the ground and possibly have their feet crushed. But our cadres, squad leaders, and most comrades were not afraid. We thought it was no more dangerous than fighting a war, and we dared to fight, so we were not afraid to get on the rail. At the same time, we put forward the slogan "Injury is Glorious!" Led by cadres, everyone rushed to complete the task.
  2. The Happiest Day
    Eight or nine chopping axes had to be changed every day, and the blacksmith felt a little dishonored. One day he said: Let the chopping be done with a little oil. We tried it, and not only did it reduce the damage to the chopping axe, but it also chopped very quickly. On the same day, we invented a labor-saving method of pressing the rail. We reduced the number of people on the rail and sent four more people to the end that was being pried up. They grabbed the rail with their hands and slammed it down, and the rail broke immediately under the pressure. It was fast and labor-saving, and everyone was very happy. The more they cut, the more energetic they became. On this day, they cut thirty-one rails.
  3. Put Down the Hammer and Pick Up the Gun
    Chadian is more than ten miles away from Baishan. In those days, the enemy constantly attacked and surrounded Baishan. Therefore, in addition to cutting the rail during the day, we had to be on guard at night.
    One night, we received information that the enemy was going to attack the mountain, and we heard sporadic gunfire and landmines exploding. The masses in the villages fled one after another. We made a lot of noise all night, and after sleeping for two hours at dawn, we called everyone up to cut the rail immediately in order to complete the task ahead of schedule. We worked until noon when we suddenly heard that the enemy had set off again. The comrades put down their hammers and chopping axes, and carried their guns to the front mountain. At this time, the masses praised us and said: "These people are really capable! They put down their hammers and pick up their guns. They do this and then do that. They really mean what they say!" When the enemy situation was far away, we immediately cut the rail again.
    We cut rails for seven days, cutting one hundred and forty major rails, and a whole dozen people were injured. But thanks to everyone's efforts and the leading role of the cadres and squad leaders (especially Comrade Cui Qinghu, who became a model in the team's entire work), the task was finally completed (reprinted from "Jiaozuo Workers").

### 截铁轨  焦作前方工人纠察队二三事

　　截铁轨
    焦作前方工人纠察队二三事
    “这伙人，真能干”一句话，是在边沿区茶棚村截道轨时，该村群众和过往行人，赞扬工纠队的话，当时有几件事情，介绍于下：
  一、谁看着也害怕
    要想截断铁道，必须将铁道的一端撬在压力相当重的铁道工事下，另一端则用人力来压。被撬起来的道轨有一人多高，因此无论谁看了也害怕。负责截道的李玉明同志也承认上铁道是件危险事。白玉华同志上了两次，再不敢上了，的确，危险的很，上的人少了不但铁道压不断，而会将人一挑摔在地下，压断的话，又有压脚的可能。但我们干部、班长及大部同志是不害怕的，我们认为没有打仗危险，还敢打仗呢，上铁道更不怕，同时提出口号“受伤是光荣的！”由干部等带头，争先的上去完成任务。
  二、最高兴的一天
    每天要换八九个剁斧，铁匠也感到有点不光荣。有一天他说话了：让剁时沾点油。我们试了一下，不仅少损剁斧，而且剁的很快。当天又发明了压道省力法，道上少上几个人，另派四人到撬高那一端，用手抓住道轨，猛力往下一摔，上边一压，即断了，又快、又省力，大家觉得非常高兴，越截越有劲，就在这一天，截了三十一根。
  三、放下榔头拿起枪
    茶棚距柏山十余里路，那几天敌人不断到柏山来袭击、包围，因此，我们除了白天截道外，黑夜还得担任警戒。
    有一夜接到下边情报，敌人要攻山，并发觉枪声乱响，地雷也爆炸了。各村群众纷纷逃来。闹了整整一夜，天明睡了两个钟头，我们为了提前完成任务，把大家叫起来，马上进行截道，一直干到中午时，忽又听到敌人出发了。同志们放下榔头及剁斧，背起枪即拉到前山去了，这时，群众们赞扬的说：“这伙人，真能干呀，放下榔头就是枪，不干这样干那样，真算话呀”。敌情远了，我们马上又截道了。
    前后截道七天，截大道一百四十根，受伤人员整一打。但因大家努力，干部班长起了带头作用，（尤其是崔清虎同志成为全队整个工作中的模范），任务总算是完成了（转自《焦作工人》）。
