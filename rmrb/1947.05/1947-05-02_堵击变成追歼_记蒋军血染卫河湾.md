　　From Blocking to Pursuit
    A Record of Jiang's Troops' Blood Staining the Wei River Bend
    [Report from the North Henan Front, 28th of this month] (Delayed) Reporter Wu Xiang reports: Two-thirds of the Sichuan Army's 40th Division have already been sacrificed for Chiang Kai-shek's treasonous civil war. Its 379th Regiment was completely annihilated at Zhangzhuang Wei River bend, fifteen miles southwest of Daokou Town. On April 17th, the pocket of the People's Liberation Army surrounding and annihilating the invading Jiang troops tightened. At 10:00 AM the next morning, the 379th Regiment broke out south from near Tongshan and was blocked by our reconnaissance forces, triggering fierce fighting in Qianhou Liuzhuang. Soldiers of the 7th Company bravely charged into the ranks of the Jiang army with bayonets. Yang Huairong himself stabbed five enemies to death. The Jiang army was thrown into chaos, losing their flags, backpacks, and weapons, and scattering southward in a rout. Thus, blocking turned into pursuit, with engineers, artillerymen, cooks, animal tenders, and office cadres all rushing forward with hand grenades. The entire Wei River bend was engulfed in smoke, dust, and the din of gunfire. Jiang army regimental commander Luo Zuguang angrily brandished his saber, forcing soldiers to break through. The damned officers even cruelly shot at hesitant soldiers. The Jiang soldiers helplessly jumped into the river, which was more than two people deep. Some were shot dead while still taking off their clothes. Others were pushed in before they could even undress. They desperately crowded and struggled, floating up and sinking down. The calm and waveless Wei River was stained red with blood and churned up by corpses. The pursuing warriors reached the riverbank and killed the murderous Regimental Commander Luo. Many Jiang soldiers near the shore ran back. A seventeen-year-old soldier who was about to drown was rescued. Jiang soldiers on the shore laid down their weapons one after another, some kneeling down and shouting, "I'm surrendering the mortar." Others called out from afar, "I know your policy, I'll give you my gun." Six signalmen captured more than sixty enemies alive. Batches of prisoners were gathered, helping to carry the guns and reforming the ranks, totaling 533 people. They all knew they were the luckiest part of this regiment. In the fields, alongside the frightened mules and horses, were also oxen and donkeys, which the Jiang army had looted from the Zhangzhuang area. As soon as the gunfire stopped, the villagers came to find them. The ground was littered with the corpses and wounded of the Jiang army, and abandoned backpacks, official documents, helmets, bayonets, bullets, and gambling items such as dominoes were scattered everywhere. Even more surprisingly, there were abacuses, floral quilts, velvet hats, glass mirrors, combs, pillows, women's trousers and socks, red shoes, and photos – a bizarre array of things. Three days later, the villagers of Zhangzhuang were still捞 out捞 (fishing out) four machine guns from the river. On the river's surface were still swollen corpses of Jiang soldiers, bearing their endless resentment towards Chiang Kai-shek, following the slow-moving river.

　　堵击变成追歼
    记蒋军血染卫河湾
    【本报豫北前线廿八日电】（迟到）记者吴象报导：川军四十师已有三分之二作了蒋介石卖国内战的牺牲品，其三七九团又在道口镇西南十五里张庄卫河河湾处全部覆灭了。四月十七日，人民解放军围歼北犯蒋军的口袋缩紧了，次日上午十时，三七九团从童山附近向南突围，遭我文字部队堵击，在前后刘庄展开激战。七连战士勇猛地端着刺刀，冲进蒋军行列，杨怀荣自己就刺倒了五个。蒋军混乱了，丢掉了彩号，丢掉了背包，丢掉了武器，四散南逃，溃不成军。于是堵击变成追歼，工兵、炮兵、炊事员、饲养员、机关干部都提着手榴弹冲过来。卫河湾整个沉入硝烟尘土和枪弹的喧闹中。蒋军团长罗祖光愤怒地挥舞着指挥刀，逼迫士兵突围。该死的军官们甚至残忍地对着迟疑的士兵射击。蒋军士兵们无可奈何地跳进两人多深的河水，有的正在脱衣服就被打死了。有的衣服还没有脱就被推进去了。彼此绝望地挤拥着、挣扎着，浮起来又沉下去。平稳无波的卫河被血染红了，被尸首搅翻了。追击的勇士赶到了河岸，打死了那个杀气腾腾的罗团长，许多离岸不远的蒋军又向回跑。一个快淹死的十七岁的士兵被救了出来。岸上的蒋军纷纷放下武器，有的跪下来叫：“我交迫击炮”。有的却远远的打招呼：“我知道你们政策，我把枪给你”。六个通讯员活捉了六十多个敌人。俘虏们一批批集拢，帮着扛起枪，重新排队，总数是五百三十三名。他们都清楚自己是这个团最幸运的一部分。田野间和骡马一齐惊慌乱跑的还有牛驴，那是蒋军从张庄一带抢来的。枪声甫停，老乡就追来寻找了。满地是蒋军遗弃的尸骨、伤员，狼藉地弃扔了的背包、公文卷宗、钢盔刺刀、子弹和牌九等赌品、更出奇的还有算盘、花被、绒帽、玻璃镜、梳、篦、枕头、妇人的裤袜、红鞋、照片等光怪陆离的东西。三天之后，张庄的老乡还从河里捞出四挺机枪。河面上还有浮肿的蒋军尸首，含着他对蒋介石无穷的冤恨，跟随缓慢的河水流去。
