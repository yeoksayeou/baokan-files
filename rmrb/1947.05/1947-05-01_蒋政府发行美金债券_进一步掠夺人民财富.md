Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th: According to reports from newspapers in Nanjing and Shanghai: The Chiang government's four families recently issued four hundred million U.S. dollar bonds under this name, further plundering the wealth of the people in the Chiang-controlled areas. Among them, three hundred million U.S. dollars are in short-term "treasury bills," which are sold at the Chiang Kai-shek Central Bank's exchange rate of 1:12,000 against the U.S. dollar. One hundred million U.S. dollars are in "U.S. dollar bonds," which are purchased with gold and U.S. dollars. If these "bonds" can be sold out, the four families can collect 3.6 trillion Chiang currency and gold and U.S. dollars worth 1.2 trillion Chiang currency. The "short-term treasury bills" and "U.S. dollar bonds" began to be sold in Shanghai and other places on April 5th through free "solicitation," but according to a special article in the Chiang Kai-shek's *Central Daily News* on the 9th of the same month: "It is difficult to predict whether those with gold and foreign exchange will voluntarily purchase them. Therefore, the government (Chiang government) may first try 'free solicitation' when promoting them; if the results are not significant, it should still adopt the method of compulsory 'requisition'."

The characteristics of the "U.S. Dollar Bonds" are: (1) In the past, the government mostly used Chiang currency as the unit for public bonds, but now the Chiang currency has depreciated, and the people have lost confidence. Therefore, this time, the U.S. dollar is used as the unit to "eliminate the risk for purchasers." (Central Daily News quoted) (2) It is convenient for the Kuomintang's four families to frantically plunder the civilian gold and U.S. dollars frozen by the previous "economic emergency measures" and to collect a large amount of floating capital. The economic crisis in the Chiang-controlled areas will inevitably be further deepened as a result.

　　蒋政府发行美金债券  进一步掠夺人民财富
    【新华社陕北廿九日电】综合京沪报讯：蒋政府四大家族近以发行四亿美元的美金债券为名，进一步掠夺蒋管区人民财富。其中三亿美元为短期“库券”，按蒋记中央银行一比一万二千的美金挂牌折合美金发售。一亿美元为“美金公债”，以黄金与美钞缴购。此项“债券”如能售完，四大家族可搜刮三万六千亿元蒋币，及价值一万二千亿元蒋币之黄金与美钞。“短期库券”与“美金公债”四月五日起于上海等地开始以自由“劝募”方式发售，但据同月九日蒋记《中央日报》专论称：“有黄金外汇者是否愿自动承购，殊难逆断。故政府（蒋政府）于推销时不妨先试行‘自由劝募’；若成效不彰，则仍应采用强制‘征借’方式”。
    “美金债券”之特点为：（一）以往政府对公债多以蒋币为单位，现蒋币贬值，人民失却信心，故此次以美金为单位，“免除购买者之风险”。（中央日报语）（二）便于国民党四大家族疯狂掠夺前以“经济紧急措施”所冻结之民间黄金、美钞，及搜刮大批游资。蒋管区经济危机势将因此更加深刻化。
