　　After Precise Calculations
    Xu Jiahou Overcomes Labor Shortages
    [This newspaper Taihang News] Xu Jiahou overcame labor shortages through precise calculations. This village is an advanced village in Huguan County. During the spring plowing campaign, there was a lot of work to be done, and twenty-two laborers went to the front lines. The cadres immediately thought that there was a shortage of labor and that production could not be carried out. Just shouting "labor shortage" did not solve the problem. After convening a meeting of village cadres, it was first proposed: "This year's labor shortage must be solved by mobilizing a large number of women to participate in agricultural production." However, everyone underestimated women. Public Security Officer Chun Gou said: "Women can only spin and weave at home, and they are useless in the fields." Then, he started to grumble. Labor hero Li Ming then suggested: "Women can do great things. My mother and my wife reclaimed more than ten mu of wasteland in the spring of the year before last. Who doesn't know that? It's not that women are useless, it's whether they do it or not. For example, in the past, we thought weaving was something only Henan people did, but now? People in Shanxi have also learned it, and they have all benefited from it. You can't stop them even if you want to." This straightened out the thinking of all the cadres. Then, precise calculations were carried out. The whole village has 1,350 mu of autumn land. In addition to the 350 mu of Golden Queen land that has already been planted, there are still 1,000 mu. In addition to the completed ditching, embankment building, and fertilizer transportation, 3,400 workdays are still needed to ensure planting. Currently, there are 89 male full and semi-laborers in the village. Assuming each does 25 workdays (from now until Lesser Fullness), a total of 2,225 workdays are needed. This means that male full and semi-laborers alone cannot solve the problem. We must mobilize female labor to participate in agricultural production. There are a total of 130 female laborers in the village. Assuming each female laborer also does 25 workdays (adjusting light and heavy work can equal one male full laborer), using only 50 women (30 have already participated) can solve the problem completely; and there are 75 workdays to spare. The remaining 80 women can still spin and weave as usual. In terms of animal power, the whole village has 88 cattle and 21 donkeys. 74 cattle and donkeys can be used. 60 of them are formed into 30 pairs. Assuming each pair plows 2 mu of land per day, all the land can be plowed in 17 days. The remaining 14 donkeys can also be drawn out for transportation. After such calculations, not only was the labor shortage solved, but also both agriculture and sideline occupations were not delayed. Therefore, the cadres also said happily: "If we had calculated this earlier, we wouldn't have worried so much." That day, they went door-to-door to mobilize and organize the masses, and the whole village was filled with enthusiasm for production.

　　经过精确计算
    徐家后克服劳力困难
    【本报太行讯】徐家后经过精确计算，克服劳力困难。该村是壶关一个先进村，在春耕运动中，各种工作较多，参战走了二十二个劳力，干部即认为劳力缺乏，生产没法搞。光空喊：“劳力缺乏”也未解决，经召开了村干部会议，首先提出：“今年的劳力缺乏必须动员大批妇女参加农业生产。”但大家轻视妇女，公安员春狗说：“妇女只能在家纺织，到地里不顶个啥用。”接着即圪嚷起来，劳动英雄李明则提出：“女人能顶大事，我母亲和我老婆两人前年春天即开荒十几亩，你们谁不知道？不是妇女不顶事，是在他干不干，如过去咱们认为纺织是河南人的事，现在呢？山西人也都学会了，都得了利，你不让干也不行。”这样一来把全体干部思想打通了。接着即进行精确计算，全村共有秋地一千三百五十亩，除了三百五十亩金皇后已经下种外，尚有一千亩，每亩地除刨边、垒堰、运肥已完成外，尚需三千四百个工即可保证下种。目前村内有男全半劳力八十九个，每个以二十五工计（从现在到小满），共需二千二百廿五个工，这样仅以男全半劳力尚不能解决问题，必须动员妇女劳力参加农业生产。全村共妇女劳力一百卅个，每个妇女劳力也亦二十五工计算（轻重活调剂可顶一男全劳力），只用五十个（已参加三十个）妇女即可全部解决问题；并长余七十五个工，其余八十个妇女还可照常纺织。在畜力上全村共有牛八十八头、驴廿一头，能用的牛驴七十四头，以六十头组成三十犋，每日每犋以犁地二亩计，十七天即可全部犁完，其余十四头驴还可抽出来去搞运输。经过这样计算，不但解决了劳力困难，而且做到了农副业两不耽误，因此干部亦高兴的说：“咱们要早计算计算来，早就不发愁了。”当天即分门挨户的去动员组织群众，全村鼓起了生产热劲。
