　　Merchants in Fucheng Town Help Military Families with Spring Plowing
    [This newspaper's Lingchuan news] There are forty-seven military families in Fucheng Town, with a total of 376 mu of land to be cultivated on their behalf. Each mu of land requires five laborers for delivering manure, repairing field edges, plowing, and sowing seeds, totaling 1,880 laborers. Furthermore, militiamen and self-defense forces must participate in the war effort and support tasks, making it somewhat overwhelming. After discussion by the town's Federation of Industry and Commerce, everyone believed that various businesses could also spare some people to help military families with spring plowing. A unanimous decision was made to allocate twenty laborers daily, starting from April 24th, to help military families with spring plowing. Forty-one students with relatively strong labor capacity from the San Gao schools also voluntarily participated. After three days of intensive work, the delivery of manure, repairing of field edges, and plowing of valley land have been largely completed. Currently, only a few scattered tasks remain, and all will be completed in another two days. (Shu Xian)

　　附城镇商人帮助军属春耕
    【本报陵川讯】附城镇共有军属四十七户，共有代耕地三百七十六亩，每亩地送粪、修边、代耕、代下种，就得需工五个，共需工一千八百八十个，再加上民兵、自卫队要去参战支差，就有些忙不过来。该镇商联会讨论后，大家认为各商号还可以抽出一部分人来帮助军属春耕。一致决定自四月二十四日起，每天抽出二十个劳力帮助军属春耕。三高学生亦自愿抽出劳力比较强的四十一人配合参加。经过三天突击，送粪、修边、耕谷地已大部完成，刻下只留少数零星生活，再有两天即可全部完成。（恕先）
