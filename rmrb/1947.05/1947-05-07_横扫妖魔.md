　　Sweeping Away Demons and Monsters
    Wu Xiang
    The People's Liberation Army bravely advances westward, shaking northern Henan. The gang of traitors and ugly creatures in the rear of Chiang's army lose color and flee like homeless dogs; some are captured before they even wake up from their dreams—

  “I am your savior!”
    The Si unit marched west of Changyuan city in the middle of the night. The team stopped to rest, and administrator Ji Yanshu went to Xiaosigu Village to call for houses. Gunshots and grenade explosions were heard in the neighboring village, and the scouts encountered a team of local reactionaries who were surrounding and arresting people. He entered the village and saw a group of people with guns, peeking and probing. Knowing they were up to no good, he shouted, "Hurry up and leave, the Eighth Route Army is here!" After saying that, he turned around and left. The bewildered local reactionaries hurriedly followed him in a panic. When they reached the village where the troops were resting, he ordered these twenty-odd fellows to sit down and gather their guns together. They asked blankly, "Who exactly are you?" Old Ji replied with a smile, "Who am I? I am your savior—the Eighth Route Army! Surrender your guns quickly!"

  “The harvest of ten bullets.”
    The troops advanced and camped near Lao’an Town in Hua County. During the Hua County battle last winter, the Chiang troops in Shangguan Village and Shaoerzhai were completely annihilated. The 375th Regiment of the 125th Brigade, hiding in Lao’an, fortunately survived. This time, they couldn't hold back. That night, they abandoned their strong fortifications and the entire regiment fled south in a panic, encountering a small number of personnel from the Meng unit. The soldiers only fired a few shots, and the Chiang troops were thrown into chaos and scattered. As a result, several were wounded, 124 were captured (including four officers above the rank of platoon leader), and the following were seized: one American-made light machine gun, one 82mm mortar body, one heavy machine gun mount, thirty-seven rifles and carbines, one hundred and fourteen shells, one box of rocket launcher shells, fifteen thousand rounds of ammunition, one American-made radio and one telephone, and five large carts fully loaded with supplies, and one shell cart. The soldiers, escorting the prisoners and pulling the carts, said with smiles, "This is the harvest of ten bullets!"

  “No matter how fast you are, you can’t outrun us!”
    After recovering Yanjin, the troops continued westward that night. The Si unit stopped at Heiyangshan Town northwest of Yangwu at dawn. There were also many miscellaneous bad elements here. The vanguards fired a few shots and captured them all. After camping, more than twenty prisoners were sent to the political department. Among them was a man wearing a gabardine Zhongshan suit with a small white circular badge on his chest. His name was Yan Shougu, and he was the judicial director of Yanjin County.

    A comrade called out as if he had met an acquaintance, "I saw your business card in Yanjin City. You ran really fast, and you're already in Yangwu."

    Yan Shougu replied dejectedly, "No need to say more, no matter how fast you are, you can’t outrun you!"

  “What? You’ll know when you listen!”
    In the Chiang-controlled Heiyangshan Town government office, I smelled the tempting aroma of wine and meat. I walked into the town mayor's office. On the table were leftovers of dishes, pastries, wine bottles, thermos bottles, and exquisite porcelain cups and dishes. Official documents and a large number of unregistered national identity cards were scattered on the iron bed and sofa. There was a telephone in the corner, and several soldiers were huddled together, pressing their ears to the headset. Their expressions were as if they had made a very important and very interesting secret discovery. They were trying their best to hold back their laughter, but their mouths were already cracked open, their faces twisted, and their eyes narrowed into slits. I asked, "What? What?"

    "What? You'll know when you listen."

    I took the headset. There was a buzzing sound inside. After listening carefully, everything was clear. It turned out that the telephone line had not been cut, and those bad elements were still talking!

    "There are a lot of them, everywhere, it's very tense, how about your side?"

    "What? Yangwu is lost, Yanjin is also lost, oh dear, which road should we run on!" They were so panicked that it was "pitiful"!

    "Hey! Brother, brother! Remember to give me a shout when you run, don't forget!" The voice was so anxious that it was about to cry.

    I don't know what my expression was at the time, but when I saw the strange, happy looks on the faces of the soldiers huddled next to the headset, I couldn't help but laugh.

　　横扫妖魔
    吴象
    人民解放军勇猛西进，豫北震动。蒋军后方之群奸众丑，失色奔逃，有如丧家之犬；有的睡梦未醒，已当了俘虏——
  “我是你的救星！”
    泗字部队半夜走到长垣城西，队伍停止休息，管理员姬雁树到小司谷村去号房子。邻村在响枪响手榴弹，侦察员们遇到一队还乡团，正在包围捉拿。他走进村，看见一伙人提着枪探头探脑的，知道不是好东西。便喊：“还不快走，八路军来啦”！说完扭头就走。吓糊涂了的还乡团们慌慌张张的急忙也跟着他走。走到队伍休息的村子，他命令这二十多个家伙坐下，把枪收到一起。他们楞楞地问：“你到底是谁？”老姬笑着回答道：“我是谁？我是你的救星——八路军！赶快缴枪！”
  “十颗子弹的收获。”
    部队开进到滑县老岸镇附近宿营。去冬滑县战役，上官村和邵耳寨的蒋军都全部被歼灭了。躲在老岸的一二五旅三七五团总算侥幸还保存着。这一次他沉不住气了，当夜就放弃了坚固的工事，全团狼狈南遁，与猛字部队少数人员遭遇。战士们只打了几枪，蒋军就混乱溃散了，结果击伤数名，俘一百二十四名（内排以上军官四名），缴美式轻机枪一挺，八二迫击炮身一，重机枪架一，长短枪三十七支，炮弹一百十四发，火箭筒弹一箱，子弹一万五千发。美造话报机及电话机各一部，满载给养的大车五辆，炮弹车一辆。战士们押着俘虏拉着大车，嘻笑颜开地说：“这是十颗子弹的收获！”
  “再快还是快不过你们！”
    收复延津之后，当夜部队又继续西进，泗字部队拂晓在阳武西北的黑羊山镇停止了，这里也有不少乱七八糟的坏蛋，尖兵打了几枪，都捉了起来。宿营后，二十多个俘虏送到了政治处。其中有一个穿着哔叽的中山装，胸口有个白色圆形的小徽章，他叫燕受古，是延津县的司法主任。
    一位同志像碰见熟人似的叫起来：“我在延津城里见过你的名片，你跑得真快，一下又跑到阳武来了。”
    燕受古垂头丧气地回答道：“不用说了，再快还是快不过你们！”
  “什么？你听听就知道了！”
    我在蒋记黑羊山镇公所里闻到了诱人的酒肉香味，我走进镇长室，桌上有吃剩的菜肴点心、酒瓶、热水瓶、精致的磁杯、碗碟。铁床和沙发上散乱着公文以及大批尚未登记的国民身份证。墙角有一架电话机，几个战士挤成一团把耳朵凑到耳机旁边。那神情像是有了极重要的与极有兴趣的秘密发现。竭力要忍住笑，却已经裂着嘴，扭歪了脸，眼睛眯成一道缝了。我问：“什么？什么？”
    “什么？你听听就知道了。”
    我接过耳机，里面有嗡嗡的响声，仔细一听，什么都清楚了，原来电线尚未割断，那些坏蛋还在通话哩！
    “多得很，到处都是，紧张得很，你们那边呢？”
    “怎么？阳武丢了，延津也丢了，啊呀，我们走那条路跑呢！”真惊慌得“可怜”！
    “喂！老兄老兄！跑起来千万打个照呼，千万别忘啦！”声音里急得要哭了。
    我不知道自己当时脸上的表情，但我看了凑在耳机旁边的战士们那副高兴的怪样子，实在忍不住要笑。
