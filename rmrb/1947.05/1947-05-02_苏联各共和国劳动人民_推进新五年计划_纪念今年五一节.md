This year, 1,226 kilometers of new railways will be added, and new rails will be added to 1,265 kilometers of railways, converting them into double-track railways. Major locomotive and carriage repair plants are planned to reach pre-war levels this year, and many plants will exceed the plan. The powerful new FD-type locomotives have been manufactured in Kharkov, and 50 will be completed by the end of this year. New-type freight trams will be built for May Day and used to transport coal. The largest automobile repair plant in the Moldavian Republic is under construction.

The largest textile factory in Estonia, which was destroyed during the war, produced twice as much cotton yarn and two and a half times as many textiles as last year. Workers will hand over 100,000 meters of textiles more than planned for May Day. The output of more than 100 pharmaceutical factories across the Soviet Union will increase by 25% this year compared to last year. Twenty new pulp and paper mills across the Soviet Union have already started operations. The submarine cable factory, ball bearing factory, and machinery repair factory planned in the new Five-Year Plan will all start operations in Kharkov around May Day. The mechanized bakery in Moldavia has been completed, and the large candy factory is under construction. The five hydroelectric power stations built on the Volga Canal can supply 1.5 billion kilowatts of electricity. The largest No. 10 Siemens-Martin furnace in the Dnieper River basin has been restarted, and workers are stepping up the restoration of the power station. Voroshilovgrad has completed the restoration of four large mines to commemorate May Day. Coal miners in the Donbass completed the four-month plan ahead of schedule and guaranteed to produce 63,000 tons of coal more than planned for the state.
