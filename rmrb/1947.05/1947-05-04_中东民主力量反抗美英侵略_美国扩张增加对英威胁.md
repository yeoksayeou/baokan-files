　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th. Comprehensive reports: As the Palestine issue is brought to the United Nations Special General Assembly for discussion, two situations are emerging in the Middle East: one is the resistance of democratic forces to the policies of US-British imperialism, and the other is that American expansion is increasing the threat to Britain. According to TASS: The National Free Youth Group conference of Transjordan recently called for a struggle to demand the revision of the unequal British-Transjordan treaty and the withdrawal of British troops stationed in Transjordan, and passed a resolution strongly stating that it does not recognize the Turkish-Transjordan agreement, because Turkey's policy is to vigorously consolidate Anglo-American control in Arab countries. The Democratic newspaper in Baghdad, Iraq, also criticized the proposed Turkish-Iraqi political and economic treaty for the same reason, declaring: The Iraqi people do not want to entrust their future to Turkey's policy of consolidating the interests of Anglo-American imperialism. It urged the Iraqi government to "struggle to achieve the withdrawal of British troops stationed in Iraq and the abolition of unequal treaties." Furthermore: Cadson, Counselor of the US Embassy in Egypt, and Secretary Erlind, have recently been working hard to "mediate" the Anglo-Egyptian dispute, urging Britain and Egypt to reopen negotiations (note: the negotiations broke down because Britain did not agree to the immediate withdrawal of British troops from Egypt and the restoration of Egyptian sovereignty in Sudan), attempting to fish in troubled waters and further intervene in Egypt, excluding British efforts in Egypt. On the 24th, the Tehran newspaper Dad in Iran also exposed the secret US-Iranian loan in a commentary. The newspaper cited broadcasts from Paris, saying that the United States has agreed to lend the Iranian government 25 million US dollars to purchase arms. Obviously, this is another instance of US imperialism extending its tentacles of expansion to Iran.

　　中东民主力量反抗美英侵略
    美国扩张增加对英威胁
    【新华社陕北三十日电】综合报导：当巴勒斯坦问题提到联合国特别大会去讨论的时候，在中东表现出两种情况：一种是民主力量对于美英帝国主义政策的反抗，另一种是美国的扩张增加着对英国的威胁。据塔斯社讯：外约旦全国自由青年团体会议顷呼吁为要求修改不平等的英国外约旦条约和撤退英国驻外约旦军队而斗争，并通过决议力陈不承认土耳其与外约旦协定，因为土耳其的政策是极力巩固英美在阿拉伯国家的控制。伊拉克巴格达的民主报纸，亦以同样理由抨击拟议中的土耳其、伊拉克政治经济条约。宣称：伊拉克人民并不想将他们的前途寄托土耳其的巩固英美帝国主义利益的政策上面。并敦促伊拉克政府“必须为达到英国驻伊军队的撤退与取消不平等条约而奋斗。”又讯：美国驻埃及大使馆参赞卡德荪和秘书伊尔林德，近来极力奔走“调解”英埃纠纷，促使英埃重开谈判（按：该谈判系因英国不答应英军立即自埃及撤退与恢复埃及在苏丹的主权而破裂），图从中混水摸鱼更进一步的插足埃及，排斥英国在埃及的努力。二十四日伊朗德黑兰的达德报，亦于评论中揭穿了正在秘密进行的美伊贷款。该报引证巴黎的广播，谓美国已允借予伊朗政府二千五百万美元以购买军火。显然的，这是美帝国主义又一次向伊朗伸出扩张的魔爪。
