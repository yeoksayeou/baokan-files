　　【This Dispatch from Taiyue on the 8th】 The peasants participating in the war effort, serving on the Jinan front this time, have maintained full enthusiasm for over a month, actively and voluntarily helping the troops dig trenches for combat and conduct propaganda work in the newly recovered areas. Yang Jinyu, a stretcher-bearer from Fushan, dug trenches with the soldiers just over a yard away from the碉堡 (blockhouse) during the Yicheng Campaign. After the battle began, he rescued the wounded on the front lines. Bai Wende from Dongmagou took up a hand grenade and went with the troops to pursue the enemy, capturing an enemy squad leader and seizing a rifle. The participating masses in Yangcheng all joined in digging trenches during the attack on Quwo. Yan Yinliu and Yang Xiaoyi fell ill, and the cadres told them to go back, but they said, "Everyone else is participating in the war to defend Chairman Mao, we can't go back." They braced themselves and participated in the war effort with everyone else. In Nanchang Village, Quwo, they saw enemy slogans written on the walls, so they went up and washed them off, rewriting more than twenty of our slogans. When they moved to Shijiadong, they carried water for the families of soldiers. Yu Pingli and Li Laihe held the wounded soldiers in their arms and fed them water while carrying them. Xu Genhai carried the wounded soldiers on his back and waded across the river. The wounded soldiers said, "You are too tired." He said, "You shed blood and sacrifice for the people, I should do this!"

　　晋南农民热烈参战
    【本报太岳八日电】此次服务于晋南前线的参战农民，在一个多月的工作中，情绪始终饱满并积极自动的帮助部队挖壕作战，进行新收复区宣传工作。浮山担架员杨锦玉在翼城战役中，和部队战士在离碉堡一丈多远的地方挖战壕，战斗开始后，又在火线上抢救伤员。东马沟柏文德拿上手榴弹和部队一块去追击敌人，俘敌班长一名，缴步枪一支。阳城参战群众在攻曲沃时，都参加了挖战壕工作。阎银柳、杨小异病了，干部叫他们回去，他们说：“人家都参战保卫毛主席，我们不能回。”抖起精神和大家一块参战，在曲沃南常村，他们看见墙上写着敌人的标语，便上去洗掉，重写了我们的二十多条标语，他们移住石家洞又给军属担水。与平李来和在抬送伤兵中，把伤兵抱在怀里喂水。徐根亥把伤员背在身上，涉水过河，伤员说：“你太辛苦了。”他说：“你们流血牺牲是为了老百姓，我应该这样作！”
