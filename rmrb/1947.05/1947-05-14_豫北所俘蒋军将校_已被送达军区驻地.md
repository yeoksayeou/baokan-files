The list of the twelve field grade officers ("Colonels") is as follows: (1) Lin Hexuan, Lieutenant Colonel Chief of Staff of the 49th Brigade of the Chiang Army, from Weiyuan, Sichuan, a graduate of the twelfth class of the Chiang Kai-shek Central Military Academy. (2) Wang Jibin, Lieutenant Colonel Acting Commander of the 146th Regiment of the 49th Brigade, 31 years old, from Liling, Hunan, a graduate of the sixth class of Whampoa. (3) He Mingfu, Colonel Chief of the Staff Office of the Headquarters of the Provisional 3rd Column of the Chiang Kai-shek National Defense Department, 45 years old, from Fugou, Henan. (4) Qi Ziwan, Colonel Director of the Adjutant Office of the Headquarters of the 3rd Column, 45 years old, from Yandu, Henan. (5) Chen Miansun, Colonel Director of the Transportation Office of the Headquarters of the 3rd Column, 57 years old, from Minhou, Fujian. (6) Liu Qizhong, Lieutenant Colonel Director of the Military Law Office of the Headquarters of the 3rd Column, from Xinxiang, Henan.

(12) Li Junqi, Lieutenant Colonel Adjutant of the 5th Detachment of the 3rd Column, 37 years old, from Cangxian, Hebei.
Among these twenty-two Chiang army officers, five laid down their weapons from the 49th Brigade, and seventeen were captured from the Provisional 3rd Column. Some of the latter seventeen did not even have time to disguise themselves and were still wearing American-style peaked caps and American-style woolen military uniforms, but they generally felt that this was something they could not be seen doing, and each of them was very listless and tired. The five from the 49th Brigade looked particularly embarrassed. Their American-style officer uniforms had all been changed, and the American-style peaked caps were nowhere to be found, so now they were all bareheaded. Major General Deputy Brigade Commander Jiang Tiexiong and Lieutenant Colonel Chief of Staff Lin Hexuan were the most embarrassed, both of whom were wearing mismatched clothes and were silently speechless. Sun Dianying appeared particularly dejected and frustrated, because he was old and weak, and he had been physically and mentally exhausted when he was surrounded, and he had no strength to support him.

　　豫北所俘蒋军将校
    已被送达军区驻地
    【本报讯】在淇县大胡营和汤阴县城放下武器的蒋军军官，共有二十二人。最近三天之内，分乘汽车三辆到达了晋冀鲁豫军区驻地。这二十二个军官中，计有“将军”十个，校官十二个。“将军”的名单如下：（一）李守正，原蒋军整三师四十九旅少将旅长，现年四十三岁，湖南新宁人，黄埔军校四期毕业生。（二）蒋铁雄，四十九旅少将副旅长，现年四十岁，江苏溧阳人，蒋记中央军校六期毕业生，并至德国学工兵六年。（三）袁峙山，四十九旅少将副旅长，现年四十六岁，湘军讲武堂毕业，湖南常宁人。（四）孙殿英，现年五十九岁，河南永城人，蒋记国防部暂编第三纵队中将司令。（五）刘月亭，暂编三纵队少将副司令，现年四十六岁，山东荷泽人。（六）邓甫暄，暂编三纵队少将参谋长，现年五十五岁，山东汶上人。（七）李民彝，暂编三纵队少将新闻处长，现年五十岁，湖北应城人。（八）杨克犹，暂编三纵队第五总队少将总队长，现年五十岁，河南洛阳人。（九）王少箴，暂编三纵队少将顾问，前任三纵队参谋长，现年六十三岁，河北任邱人。（十）贺一吾，暂编三纵队少将参议，现年五十岁，河北武强人。
    十二个校官的名单如下：（一）林鹤轩，蒋军四十九旅中校参谋主任，四川威远人，蒋记中央军校十二期毕业生。（二）王吉彬，四九旅一四六团中校代团长，现年三十一岁，湖南醴陵人，黄埔六期生。（三）何明甫，蒋记国防部暂编第三纵队司令部上校参谋处长，现年四十五岁，河南扶沟人。（四）齐子万，三纵队司令部上校副官处长，现年四十五岁，河南堰都人。（五）陈勉荪，三纵队司令部上校交通处长，现年五十七岁，福建闽侯人。（六）刘启中，三纵队司令部中校军法处长，河南新乡人。（七）董耀宗，三纵队司令部上校服务员，现年五十四岁，河北徐水人。（八）常相时，三纵队第三总队第一团上校团长，现年三十九岁，山东济南人。（九）朱锡龄，三纵队第六总队第一团上校团长，现年三十三岁，山西阳城人。（十）刘子英，三纵队第五总队上校参谋长，现年五十四岁，山东济南人。（十一）许品卿，三纵队司令部中校副官，现年四十八岁，河南灵宝人。（十二）李均启，三纵队五总队中校副官，现年三十七岁，河北沧县人。
    这二十二个蒋军军官中，从四十九旅放下武器的有五个，从暂编第三纵队俘来的有十七个。后面的十七个，还有一部分人连化装都来不及，仍然戴着美式的大盖帽子和穿着美式的呢子军衣，但是总觉得这是见不得人的样子，一个个的精神都很萎靡疲惫了。四十九旅的那五个，却格外显得狼狈不堪。他们的美式军官衣服，都换掉了，美式的大盖帽子，也不知去向了，所以现在都是光着脑袋。少将副旅长蒋铁雄和中校参谋主任林鹤轩又是最狼狈不过的，两个人的衣服都很不相称，又都是没精打彩地默默不语。孙殿英，特别显得颓唐丧气，因为他已年老血衰，而且在被围的时候早已弄得身心交困，再无一点支持的力气了。
