When they sailed near Qingdao, Wang Wenkai saw that they were far from the large sailboat, suddenly picked up an oar and killed one Chiang soldier, then quickly turned around and knocked down a Chiang soldier sitting in the rear cabin. The enemy raised his gun, and Wang rushed up to seize the gun, getting shot and sacrificing himself. Seeing this, Zhao Jinting rushed forward and grabbed the gun. Wang Rihe broke the enemy's arm with an oar, but the enemy still held onto the gun. Wang then pulled out an axe and hacked him to death. On the other fishing boat, Jiang Mingxu also took advantage of the enemy's unpreparedness and killed an enemy with an oar, then turned around and grabbed another enemy, the two of them wrestling together. Wang Lun raised an oar and struck the enemy's head, and Jiang Mingpu also raised an oar and threw it at the enemy who was about to get up. All four Chiang soldiers were finally killed.
