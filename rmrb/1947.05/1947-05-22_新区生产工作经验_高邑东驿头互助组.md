　　New District Production Work Experience
    East Yitou Mutual Aid Team, Gaoyi
    Geng Wenyan, Feng Ke
    East Yitou in Gaoyi is a new district. The whole village has 203 households, 794 people, 116 male full laborers, and 4,627 mu of land, averaging 39.9 mu of land per laborer. The village is a first-class village in Gaoyi. The land issue has been resolved relatively thoroughly, but initially, the masses had some fear of getting rich, and their enthusiasm for production was not very high. Later, after carrying out class education and policy education, and launching a "dig out hidden thoughts and tell the truth" movement, the ideological problem was solved in just a few days.

    After resolving everyone's ideological problems, the focus shifted to establishing mutual aid teams. However, the masses raised the question: "Our village has an average of 39 mu of land to be cultivated by one laborer and more than 50 mu by one draft animal. According to past experience, a good laborer can cultivate 18 mu of land (irrigated land accounts for four-fifths of the village, which is relatively time-consuming). How are we going to cultivate our land this year?" After discussion and calculation, it was unanimously agreed that the only way to cultivate the land well was through mutual aid. For example, village chief Zhu Qingxiang said during the discussion: "Zhao Laoyan (a landlord) used to cultivate 180 mu of land, only hiring five farmhands and feeding two mules, but he cultivated it very well. As long as we organize mutual aid this year, there will be no problem in cultivating it well." In order to understand the masses' thoughts further, they deliberated for two more days before formally organizing the small groups based on democratic voluntarism and finding those with similar ideas. As a result, 165 households participated, organizing a total of 27 groups. After being organized, the masses were very enthusiastic, planting 1,200 mu of cotton and 821 mu of sorghum in three days.

    In terms of work recording and work conversion in the mutual aid teams, it is determined according to the strength of the labor force, the level of skill, and the amount of work done, evaluating work based on tasks, and recording points based on work. A standard laborer is counted as a full day's work, equivalent to ten points. For those who do not reach ten work points, or those who exceed ten points, democratic evaluation is used to add or subtract points. The same calculation method is used for draft animals. It is stipulated that those who can plow three mu of land a day, or can irrigate three mu of wheat, are considered standard draft animals, and are assigned 30 points. If they exceed or fall short, the points are added or subtracted proportionally. Five *xiangs* (a traditional unit of time, roughly half a day) are stipulated per day, and those who work less than a full day are recorded by *xiang*. In terms of work conversion, work tickets are used uniformly, such as one standard draft animal can be converted into three standard laborers. In terms of returning and exchanging work, laborers can exchange for draft animal labor, male labor can be exchanged for female labor, and heavy labor can be exchanged for light labor. Those who do not return work can pay wages. Wages are determined according to the season. Currently, the wage is one point, equivalent to one and a half *jin* of grain. Those who provide meals can deduct the cost of each meal from the wage, with each meal equivalent to one and a half *jin* of grain. Currently, a production committee has been established in the village, with the participation of key cadres. In addition to each person going deep to directly lead one group, they are responsible for controlling and promoting the production work of the entire village. Education committee members and primary school teachers publish blackboard newspapers to commend models and exchange experiences at any time. In order to facilitate the adjustment of labor force and facilitate work, small teams are formed by combining four, five, or six groups to exchange with each other. In order to participate in the war effort and go on business trips, the small teams have also set up work allocation leaders, who are specially responsible for the labor and livestock used for participating in the war effort and going on business trips. At the end of the month, the work allocation leaders uniformly settle accounts with the village war support office.

　　新区生产工作经验
    高邑东驿头互助组
    耿文彦　冯克
    高邑东驿头是新区，全村二百零三户，七百九十四人，男全劳力百一十六个，土地四千六百二十七亩，每个劳力平均种地三十九·九亩。该村是高邑第一类村庄，土地问题解决比较彻底，但开始群众有某些怕富思想，生产情绪不很高。后经进行阶级教育政策教育，及开展了挖心病说实话运动，不几天思想问题就解决了。
    在解决大家思想问题后，就转向成立互助组，但群众提出：“咱村一个劳力平均要种三十九亩地，一个畜力平均五十余亩。根据往年经验，一个好劳力种十八亩地（该村水地占五分之四，比较误工），看咱村今年的地怎样种？”这个问题提出后，经讨论算账结果，一致认为想要把地养种上，只有互助起来。如村长朱庆祥在讨论时说：“咱村赵老彦（地主）过去种地百八十亩，只雇五个雇工，喂两个骡子，但人家养种的都很好，咱今年只要组织起互助，就不成问题能种好。为了更多的了解群众思想，又酝酿了两天，才正式以民主自愿，找碰心思的来结合小组。结果有一百六十五户参加，共组织了二十七组；组织起来后，群众劲头很大，三天中就种了一千二百亩棉花，八百二十一亩高粱。
    互助组在记工折工上，是按劳力强弱、技术高低、作活的多少来定，按活评工，按工记分，一个标准劳力算一整工，合十分；不够十分工者，或十分以上者，民主评定加减，在畜力上也是这样计法。规定一天能耕三亩地者，或能浇麦子三亩者，即算标准畜力，定卅分。如超过或减少，则按比例加减，每天规定五晌，不足整天者按晌记工。在折工上是统一使用工票，如一个标准畜力可折三个标准劳力。在还工换工上，是劳力可以换畜力，男工可变女工、粗工可变细工，不还工者可付工资。工资按季节来定，现在工资是一分合谷子一斤半，管饭者可从工资中扣除，每顿饭折谷子一斤半。现全村成立生产委员会，由主要干部参加，除每人深入直接领导一组外，负责掌握推动全村生产工作，教育委员、小学教员出黑板报，随时表扬模范，交流经验。为了调剂劳力便利作活，由四、五、六个组不等合编小队，互相抽换。为了参战出差，小队又设拨工组长，专门负责参战、出差所用之工畜，到月底，拨工组长统一向村抗勤算账。
