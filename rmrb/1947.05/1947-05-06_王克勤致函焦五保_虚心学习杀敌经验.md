    [Report from the Yu-Bei Front, May 4th, by our correspondent Ke Gang] Our correspondent Ke Gang reports: Wang Keqin, the famous enemy-killing hero here, after reading the news of the victory of the Taiyue People's Liberation Army in capturing five cities in a row to all the soldiers of his platoon under Tangyin City on the Yu-Bei Front on April 24th, immediately wrote to the enemy-killing hero Jiao Wubao, inquiring about his experience in killing the enemy. The original letter stated: Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu General Branch, please forward to Comrade Jiao Wubao, enemy-killing hero of the Taiyue People's Liberation Army: While we are victoriously fighting on the Yu-Bei Front, we saw the news of your consecutive capture of five cities. You have already made great contributions in the battle to defend Chairman Mao. All the comrades in our platoon salute you and hope that you will tell us more about your and everyone's experience in killing the enemy, so that we can annihilate more enemies in the battle to defend Chairman Mao and strive for the early arrival of a comprehensive counter-offensive.
