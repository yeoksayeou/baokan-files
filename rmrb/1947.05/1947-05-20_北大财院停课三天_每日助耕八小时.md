　　Peking University College of Finance Suspends Classes for Three Days
　　Daily Assistance with Plowing for Eight Hours

　　[Our Newspaper] To further strengthen the ties with the masses, Peking University College of Finance suspended classes for three days starting April 18th to help the villagers stationed there with the spring plowing rush. During these three days, all 108 faculty, staff, and students, under the personal leadership of Director Liang, dug up 587 mu of corn roots, hauled 256 loads of manure, smoked 23 piles of fertilizer (approximately 60 cartloads), plowed 15 mu of land, delivered 37 large cartloads of fertilizer, and spread fertilizer on 5 mu of land. They worked an average of eight hours each day, assisting 104 households (27 military dependents, 16 cadres, 17 orphans and widows, and 44 newly emerging middle peasants without labor). During labor, the classes, groups, and individuals all proposed competitions, starting from the school as soon as it was light and only returning when they heard the meal bell. Everyone worked without rest. Comrade Wu Sanmin from Group 4 of Class One plowed three mu of corn stubble in one hour in the morning, and even though he had two large blisters on his hands, he refused to rest; female student Wei Yanwen’s blisters on her hands bled, but she still smiled and helped the villagers as usual. This enthusiasm for labor moved the villagers. Many villagers brought food and cigarettes to the fields, but they were all politely declined. Zhang Manbao brought food to the fields twice in one day, but the students did not eat it, and he said sadly, "Do you dislike my food?" Wang Haoxue said, "Comrades, if you can't do needlework, bring it to our house in the future and we'll wash and mend it for you. Don't be shy, we're all one family."

　　北大财院停课三天
    每日助耕八小时
    【本报讯】北大财经学院，为进一步密切群众关系，特于四月十八日起停课三天，帮助驻村群众突击春耕。三天内全体教职员学生一百零八人，在梁主任亲自领导下，共刨了玉茭根五百八十七亩，出圈粪二百五十六担，薰粪廿三堆（约六十车），开地十五亩，送粪三十七大车，撒粪五亩。每天劳动平均八小时，被帮助的有一百零四户（军属二十七户，干部十六户，孤寡十七户，无劳力的新生中农四十四户）。劳动时班与班、组与组、个人与个人都提出了竞赛，天一明就从校出动，直到听见打开饭钟才回来，大家一刻也不休息。一班四组吴三民同学早上一个钟点内就刨了三亩玉茭茬，手上磨了两个大泡也不肯休息；女同学魏燕文手上的泡流出血，他还是笑嘻嘻的照常帮助老乡。这种劳动的热情感动了老乡，很多老乡往地里送饭送纸烟等，都被婉言谢绝了，张满保一天往地里送了两次饭，同学们都没吃，他很难受的说：“嫌我的饭不好吗？”王好学说：“同志，你们不会做针线活，以后拿到咱家给你们洗洗做做，不要客气，都是一家人。”
