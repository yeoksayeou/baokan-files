Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 24th. Our correspondent Sima Long reports: In this campaign, the Chiang army in the Lu Zhong mountainous area concentrated its main force in a timid and evasive manner, employing the "Hard Walnut" and "Rotten Grape" tactics from Chiang (Kai-shek) and Chen (Cheng)'s "exquisite instructions." "Hard Walnut" refers to the three main forces among Chiang's army, the Fifth Army, the Eleventh Division, and the Seventy-Fourth Division, lined up together, watching out for each other, and relying on each other for survival, making it impossible for you to bite into them, so you would have to let them occupy the area. "Rotten Grape" means that once a battle breaks out, secondary forces are concentrated to quickly pounce on you, making it difficult for you to swallow, and if you do, you'll burst. Who knew that the Hard Walnut would meet the Iron Hammer? The People's Liberation Army struck fiercely, and the Seventy-Fourth Division turned to ashes. From then on, the "Rotten Grapes" lost their reliance and were in danger of being swallowed. The Chiang army's tactics on the East China battlefield have changed repeatedly, called "Direct Drive" in Suzhong, "Divide and Advance" in the second offensive against Lianshui, "Advance in a Line" in Su(qian) North, and "North-South Advance" during the Laiwu campaign. But the more tricks, the more miserable the defeat. Chen Cheng was forced to vent his anger in his telegraph No. 402, saying: "The Supreme Commander has exquisite instructions on 'bandit suppression tactics' every day. Unfortunately, the commanders of our troops have failed to carefully understand, specifically and flexibly implement, and are accustomed to positional warfare or formula warfare, sticking to conventions, lacking creativity, and unable to adapt to changes, resulting in superior forces often being in a passive position." (Note: This telegram was captured during the Laiwu campaign.) This time, the "Hard Walnut" and "Rotten Grape" tactics must also be one of the "exquisite instructions" of the "Supreme Commander." But it still hasn't been "flexibly applied" by the commanders of various troops, even including Zhang Lingfu, who was considered a confidant by Chiang, which is really worth pondering.
　　
Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 24th. Frontline reporter Xu Wan reports: A certain unit of the East China People's Liberation Army bravely fought for Lushan (a small peak two miles southeast of Menglianggu), finally ending the fate of Chiang's Seventy-Fourth Division. At about 10:00 AM on the 16th, with the coordination of brother units who had captured Menglianggu, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, stepping on the springboard of Wanquanshan, made a final encirclement and annihilation of the remnants of Chiang's Seventy-Fourth Division, which was partially located on the top of Lushan. As soon as the commander's attack order was given, various artillery pieces bombarded fiercely, and the top of Lushan was immediately swallowed by thick smoke. The Chiang army rolled and scurried under the artillery fire of the People's Liberation Army. The five arrowheads of the People's Liberation Army quickly pointed to the top of Lushan. A small artillery platoon of a certain company, coordinated with the infantry, used intensive artillery fire to bombard the Chiang army, which was gathered in a seam. More than 100 shells all fell into the Chiang army's position. Li Gan, a famous platoon leader who defended Tiantaishan, climbed over steep cliffs and rushed directly to a major position of the Chiang army. A certain brigade repelled several charges of the Chiang army, bravely rushed to the rocky east peak of Lushan, and completely controlled the first-line position in five minutes without any casualties. Another brigade, after half an hour of fierce fighting, completely controlled the west peak of Lushan without any casualties. The bayonets of the warriors on the top of the mountain danced like thousands of golden rays, and the Chiang army rolled down the hillside one after another, encountering grenade and artillery explosions everywhere. The Chiang army's resistance was hopeless. Thousands of people surrendered as the People's Liberation Army called out. Some hurriedly crawled out of the stone crevices, put down their guns, clapped their hands, and asked the People's Liberation Army to surrender, begging for water and steamed buns. When the People's Liberation Army soldiers were escorting thousands of prisoners down the mountain, it happened to be raining heavily. The sweet rain in the Yimeng mountainous area fell widely, and the masses in the war zone clapped their hands and cheered: "Double happiness has come."
　　
Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 24th. Frontline reporters met Huang Zheng, the colonel commander of the logistics regiment of Chiang's Seventy-Fourth Division, who had laid down his weapons at the foot of Menglianggu Mountain, as well as Zhao Shikun, the deputy battalion commander of the first battalion of the 172nd Regiment of the division, and Wang Yizhi, the deputy battalion commander of the third battalion. After Huang Zheng described his experience in participating in the civil war, he said: "This time, Zhang Lingfu resolutely carried out the orders of Chiang Kai-shek and Tang Enbo, trapped in the isolated Menglianggu, resulting in the annihilation of the entire army. This tragic defeat will cause the 'National Army' to collapse like a mountain." Huang came from Sun Chuanfang's Jinling Military Academy. He claimed: "Even officers who graduated from Chiang's Central Military Academy felt their future was bleak after the battles of Subei Lianghuai (Huaiyin, Huai'an) and Lianshui last year." When talking about the encounters in this battle, the two deputy battalion commanders Zhao and Wang sighed in unison: "We were based on the top of the mountain and had not eaten for two days. The officers and soldiers generally felt hungry and desperate. We had almost nowhere to hide under your army's (referring to the People's Liberation Army) fierce artillery fire and lost all fighting spirit. The brigade commander could only sigh helplessly." According to Wang and Zhao, after the 172nd regiment suffered heavy casualties and their persuasion to the regimental commander to stop fighting was ineffective, they voluntarily rolled down the mountain from the top and surrendered to the People's Liberation Army.

　　鲁中蒋军的“硬胡桃”碰到了我军的铁锤头
    【新华社山东二十四日电】本社特派记者司马龙报导：此次蒋军在鲁中山区集中主力胆怯撞窜，运用了蒋、陈（诚）“精示”的“硬胡桃”和“烂葡萄”战术。“硬胡桃”者，即蒋军第五军、十一师、七十四师三个主力中之主力，排成一线，守望相助，相依为命，使你啃它不动，只好听他占领地方。“烂葡萄”者，即战机一旦爆发，集中次要兵力，一下塞上，使你吃它不下，吃下去了也要胀死。谁知硬胡桃遇到铁锤头，人民解放军猛然一击，七十四师就此变成灰粉。从此“烂葡萄”失掉了依靠，便有被吞没的危险。查蒋军在华东战场的战术虽然迭有改变，在苏中名为“长驱直入”，二次进攻涟水名为“分头并进”，在宿（迁）北名为“齐头并进”，莱芜战役时又叫什么“南北对进”。但花样愈多，败得愈惨。迫得陈诚在他的四○二号代电中大发脾气说：“最高统帅对于‘剿匪战术指导’日有精示，惜我各部队长官未能及时细心体会，具体灵活运动，习惯于阵地战或公式战，墨守成规，短于创造，不能随机应变，以致优势兵力常处被动。”（按该代电系莱芜战役中缴获者）此次“硬胡桃”和“烂葡萄”战术，亦当为“最高统帅”“精示”之一。但仍未为各部队长官“灵活运用”，甚至包括被蒋认为心腹的张灵甫在内，实堪寻味。
    【新华社华东前线二十四日电】前线记者徐宛报导：华东人民解放军某部，奋勇争夺芦山（孟良崮东南二里之小峰），最后结束了蒋军七十四师的命运。十六日上午十时许，解放军某部在攻占孟良崮之兄弟部队呼应配合下，踏着万泉山跳板，向偏处于芦山顶的蒋军七十四师残部作最后围歼。指挥员的攻击命令一下，各种炮一齐猛轰，顿时芦山顶为浓烟吞没了。蒋军在解放军排炮下乱滚乱窜。解放军的五支箭头，迅速指向芦山顶，某连小炮排协同步兵，以密集炮火轰击麇集在一个缝中的蒋军，一百余发炮弹全部落入蒋军阵地，坚守天台山大名鼎鼎的李干排翻登峻岩峭壁，直扑蒋军某主要阵地，某大队则击退蒋军数次冲锋，奋勇冲上巨石嶙峋的芦山东顶，五分钟抢占了第一线阵地。另一大队经半小时激战，无一伤亡的完全控制了芦山西顶。山顶上勇士们的刺刀，如万道金光飞舞，蒋军纷纷滚下山坡，到处碰上手榴弹与炮弹的爆炸。蒋军的顽抗是绝望了，成千成百的在解放军喊话中投降。有的忙从石缝里钻出，放下枪，拍着手，向解放军请降，乞求水和馒头，当解放军战士押着万千俘虏下山时，恰遇大雨，沂蒙山区甘霖普降，战地群众拍手欢呼：“双喜临门。”
    【新华社华东前线廿四日电】前线记者于孟良崮山麓会见放下了武器的蒋军七十四师辎重团上校团长黄政，及该师五十八旅一七二团一营营副赵世琨，三营营副王逸志。黄政于述其参加内战经过后称：“此次张灵甫坚决执行蒋介石、汤恩伯命令，困守孟良崮绝地，致遭全军复灭。此一惨败将使‘国军’兵败如山倒”。黄氏出身孙传芳之金陵军官学校。彼自称：“即使出身蒋家中央军校之军官，经去年苏北两淮（淮阴、淮安）涟水之战，亦多自感前途暗淡。”谈及此次作战遭遇时，赵王二营副同声叹道：“我们依据山顶，已两日不食，官兵普遍感到饥困绝望。我们在贵军（指人民解放军）猛烈炮火下几无处存身，尽失斗志。旅长也只有束手叹息而已。”按王、赵二人系以一七二团伤亡惨重，于劝告团长停止战斗无效后，乃自动由山顶滚下，向解放军投诚者。
