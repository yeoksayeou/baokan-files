　　【Report from the North Henan Front, this newspaper】Reported by a reporter from the Taihang Branch: Minister Qian of the field hospital, after months of painstaking experimentation and research, has created a new plaster cast treatment method that solves the most complex and difficult bone fracture injuries in medical treatment. This allows for rapid healing of the most common bone fracture injuries in war. The rate of disability has been reduced from the previous 50% to below 10%, which is a major contribution to the medical field of the People's Liberation Army. On the 6th of this month, when the reporter accompanied the Taihang慰问团 (comfort group) to the field hospital, Minister Qian was checking on the second batch of bone fracture patients under treatment despite being ill. According to Minister Qian, applying plaster casts is the only way to reduce bone fracture disabilities. This is the second trial of the method on the North Henan front. In the past, iron clamps and wooden boards were used to fix bone injuries, but this only achieved relative fixation. If a bone fracture injury is brought to the hospital within 24 hours, the bone is aligned, and a plaster cast is applied after three to five days. This achieves absolute fixation of the bone fracture, allowing the fractured ends to go through congestion (hematoma stage), form a pseudo-bone, gradually ossify, and eventually heal. The plaster cast is made by putting prepared plaster powder in a box, cutting a horizontal slit in the lower part of the box, and pulling a ready-made bandage through the hole. The cloth will naturally contain plaster powder, then it is rolled up, immersed in warm water until the air bubbles stop, and then taken out. The two ends of the bandage are held with both hands, and the excess water is squeezed out. Then, depending on the bone injury area and position, the bandage is wrapped around it in several layers. To strengthen the supporting force and save bandages, willow frames can be wrapped around it, and plaster paste can be applied on the outside. For wounds with suspected infection or a lot of pus, an open-window bandage can be used. The biggest advantages of this treatment are: 1. It reduces many unnecessary sufferings for patients, allows the bone to remain still, achieves absolute fixation, reduces secondary injuries caused by bone fragments, and meets the requirements for new bone growth. 2. It saves manpower and is simple to perform: in the past, several people had to carry the bone fracture injury for examination or dressing change, but now there is no trouble after the cast is applied. 3. It is very economical, and we have plenty of plaster raw materials. It is good in terms of medical treatment, economic conditions, and effects. Minister Qian continued: This bone fracture treatment method is a new development in our medical work and greatly boosts morale at the front. Although the method is simple, it requires every medical worker to fully demonstrate the spirit of serving and being responsible for the wounded wholeheartedly. After applying the plaster cast (especially in the first week), careful observation is needed at all times to see if the position is too tight (so that blood cannot reach it [impaired blood circulation]) or too loose (so that fixation is not achieved). If it is not suitable, the rope must be re-tightened, and there must be no carelessness. In the later stages of treatment, after the new bone has formed, the patient can move around. In the early stages, if the bone is shortened by five millimeters, traction can be applied to correct it, ensuring that the new bone has fewer defects. Finally, Minister Qian said: We should vigorously promote and implement this new treatment method. It is best to have medical personnel practice and apply it through short-term training courses. Currently, Minister Qian is continuing to study the treatment of special injuries (such as ear, eye, mouth, and spinal bone injuries). If successful, the new treatment method will reach a more perfect state. (Cheng Guang)

　　钱部长创石膏绷带疗法骨折残废减至百分之十
    【本报豫北前线讯】太行分社记者报导：野战医院钱部长经过几个月的苦心试验和研究，创用石膏绷带新疗法，解决了医疗上最复杂和困难的骨折伤，使战争中最多的骨折伤得以迅速治愈，残废数由以前的百分之五十减少到百分之十以下，实为人民解放军医疗上一重大贡献。本月六日，记者随太行慰问团到达野战医院时，钱部长正在带病检查第二批治疗中的骨折伤员。据钱部长谈：应用石膏绷带，是减少骨折残废的唯一办法，此次在豫北前线是试用中的第二次。过去是用铁夹和木板等来使骨伤固定，但只能达到相对固定效率，凡骨折伤在廿四小时内抬到医院后，将骨伤对正，三日至五日后，上石膏绷带，使骨折伤求得绝对固定后，骨折端处便可由充血（血肿期），形成假骨，渐而化骨以至痊愈。石膏绷带制法是将作好的石膏粉装在一个盒内，在盒下部横剪一个板缝，以现成的绷带由孔中拉过，布上自可容有了石膏粉，然后卷起在温水中浸过至气泡冒完时拿出，以两手握绷带之两端，将多余水分挤出，依骨伤部分和位置，将绷带缠上数层。为加强支持力量及节省绷带，可用柳条架缠起来，外面再涂以石膏糊。有传染可疑或脓汁多的伤口可用开窗绷带，这个疗法最大好处：一、减少病人许多不必要的痛苦，可使骨不动伤，求得绝对固定，因碎骨而产生的副伤亦可减少，并可达到适合新骨生长的要求。二、节省人力手续简便：以前骨折伤检查或换药时得几个人抬，现上好后即无麻烦。三、很经济，我们有的是石膏原料。不论从医疗及经济条件和效果上都是好的。接着钱部长讲：这个骨折伤疗法是我们医疗工作上的新发展，对前方士气鼓舞很大，方法虽简便，但却更需要每个医务人员高度发挥全心全力为伤员服务负责的精神；在上上石膏绷带后（特别在后一周内），要时时细心观察，看位置是否太紧，紧则血达不到（血液循环障碍）或松（松达不到固定效果），不合适时要重上绳，不能有丝毫马处。治疗后期新骨形成后，可活动活动。初期如骨缩短到五生的外，却可应用牵引使其整复，保证新骨减少缺陷。最后，钱部长讲：这个新疗法，我们应大力提倡和推行，最好是以短期训练班方式让医务人员来实习应用。现钱部长正在继续研究特殊创伤（如耳、目、口、脊骨伤等）的治疗，如获成功，则新疗法便达到较完美的境地。  （程光）
