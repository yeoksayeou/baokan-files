    At the symposium of drama workers held by the Propaganda Department of the Central Bureau on March 28th, everyone praised a theater troupe; this is the Taihang People's Theater Troupe, which grew up in the countryside and serves the rural masses wholeheartedly. In recent days, they have performed writer Zhao Shuli's famous works "Li Youcai's Sayings" and "Xiao Erhei's Marriage" in various agencies and stationed areas in the Border Region, as well as the opera "The White-Haired Girl" and various small rural dramas. These programs depicting peasant struggles and praising the liberation of peasants have been warmly welcomed by workers, peasants, soldiers, and cadres. Comrade Bo Yibo of the Central Bureau specially presented a prize banner, praising them as the "Banner of Rural Theater Troupes," for their skilled performances and success in raising the level of workers, peasants, and soldiers. In addition to awarding 50,000 yuan, the Propaganda Department of the Central Bureau also held a special symposium to exchange their experiences with the Taihang Cultural Troupe and to encourage them to continue their efforts after returning.

  Patient Learning  Glorious Transformation
    This banner of rural theater troupes, fluttering in the hearts of the Taihang people, grew up after patient transformation on the basis of old opera.
    As early as the summer of 1938, the "Fuleyi" old opera troupe in Xiangyuan was transformed into the Xiangyuan Rural Theater Troupe, which was the predecessor of the People's Theater Troupe. Although the name was changed to a theater troupe at that time, it actually performed old operas entirely, and the entire style of the old opera troupe, the corruption, degeneration, smoking, whoring, gambling, and other bad habits that the old society gave them, were not removed at all. In 1940, the theater troupe was led by the democratic government, and a comprehensive transformation was immediately started. First, the proposal to quit opium was put forward, and ideas were clarified through accounting, and then everyone was mobilized to make a smoking cessation plan, advocating mutual supervision and universal inspection. After three months, the number of smokers was greatly reduced. Actor Chen Danhai took the remaining money home while quitting smoking, and the relationship between husband and wife quickly improved, and Danhai's opium was completely banned from then on. Then the theater troupe began to rectify its internal affairs, abolishing the system of the owner and manager controlling the economic power of the entire troupe and extra allowances for cadres, and replacing it with economic transparency and the promotion of democracy; the actors elected an economic committee to manage their lives for the first time, improving the life of the entire troupe. The development of democratic life within the troupe also promoted the shaking of the traditional master-apprentice relationship. The idea of "If I accept an apprentice, I buy a horse, I can scold him and beat him" completely lost its power. When everything was not done according to the old order, some deviations inevitably occurred within the troupe due to the fierce resistance: the old hands were unwilling to educate the young people's ideas, and the young people also showed disrespect to the old hands. After further ideological education and self-criticism, the old hands realized that: starting from work, we should cultivate future generations; without children to match, the performance is also not good. Young people also understood that: there are also good things in old operas, without learning from the old hands, the skills cannot be improved, and the performance will not be welcomed. The new understanding encouraged every actor to freely find a teacher and make a learning plan according to their role and needs. Check every five days, summarize every ten days, rate each other, and summarize monthly to launch a competition, and reward the good ones. The upsurge of mutual respect and mutual learning within the troupe was unprecedentedly stirred up. New enthusiasm and new ideas enabled the theater troupe to quickly break through the scope of old opera in its performances, and incorporate the brand-new themes of mass struggle into the main content of stage performance. They promoted the excellent aspects of the Xiangyuan Yangko tradition, and also humbly absorbed Shangdang Gongdiao, ＠＠diao and other various good things. In this way, the People's Theater Troupe stepped out of the small scope of Xiangyuan and gained a reputation throughout the region. Every actor in the theater troupe felt for the first time the supreme glory: "We are no longer the 'actors' who used to make a living and entertain for entertainment, but have become propaganda fighters serving the people in the new society."
      ★    ★    ★
    Reflecting the Masses  Educating the Masses
    The growth of the idea of serving the people began a new experience for the People's Theater Troupe in faithfully reflecting the masses and educating the masses.
    Every actor in the People's Theater Troupe was born of poor peasants; they personally experienced the oppression of the landlord class, and although they lacked the education of a basic school, they came from the masses, and in expressing the feelings of the peasants and expressing the struggle of the peasants, they were indeed more profound than what intellectual actors could do in five or fifty years. They fully utilized this condition of being familiar with the peasant masses, and in the busy farming seasons of spring plowing, summer weeding, and autumn harvest, each actor brought back various vivid themes in the process of returning home for production. These dramas that came from the countryside and reflected the masses attracted the attention of the workers, peasants, and soldiers in the freshest way. Over the years, the People's Theater Troupe has created nearly a hundred rural scripts and fast-clappers in this way. While humbly learning from the masses, the level of compilation and performance has also improved rapidly. "Li Youcai's Sayings" and "Li Laicheng's Family" are the marks of the improvement of their compilation and performance level. The first time "Li Youcai's Sayings," adapted from Zhao Shuli's novel, was performed among the masses, it did not gain the satisfaction of the audience; but the theater troupe did not feel discouraged because of this; on the contrary, they were strengthened in confidence and courage because the audience could enthusiastically provide them with opinions. After collecting various improvement opinions in detail, they repeatedly revised and performed it four times; revised again and performed again; finally, "Li Youcai's Sayings" performed on the stage finally gained the same reputation as Zhao Shuli's novel. The performance of "Li Laicheng's Family" was also unsuccessful at the beginning; Li Minghong, the head of the theater troupe, Li Sen, the editor-in-chief, and Yan Dejin, the instructor, personally went to Li Laicheng's home to conduct investigations, from the village to conduct investigations, and from neighboring villages to conduct investigations. After ten days, they wrote the script, and then asked them to revise it in the village. The theater troupe also moved to the village for a few days, and each actor learned from the person they wanted to play, experiencing their feelings and actions, and then performed it on the stage. This is the success of "Li Laicheng's Family," which caused a sensation in Taihang and promoted the birth of countless model families. It is through such a path that the People's Theater Troupe has raised its drama level above the general level of rural theater troupes.
    These dramas reflecting the masses vividly educated the vast number of peasants to serve the war and production with all their strength, and to fight for anti-feudalism, anti-superstition, and the establishment of their new life. Around 1942, during the most difficult years of the Anti-Japanese War, the "Changing Minds" performed by the People's Theater Troupe in the rural areas of Xiangyuan powerfully helped the war mobilization and promoted the upsurge of joining the army at that time. Later, the performance of "Fighting Panlong" educated the young and strong men and militiamen in various villages during the cruel "mopping-up" and "anti-mopping-up," stubbornly launched guerrilla warfare and cave warfare, actively attacked the enemy and eliminated the enemy, to protect the property of the masses and protect the transfer of the masses. In the border areas, in villages three or four miles away from the enemy's blockhouses, the performance of "Keeping Watch at the Third Watch" awakened the people in the enemy areas who had been ravaged on how to "support" the enemy and cover up the anti-Japanese forces; many cadres of the puppet regime were affected and slowly turned back. This gave powerful support to the anti-Japanese work behind enemy lines. In 1943, Taihang suffered a drought, and the democratic government called for large-scale production to formulate plans and overcome the disaster. At that time, the masses did not know where to start. The People's Theater Troupe concentrated on the methods of formulating plans in various villages and wrote scripts and fast-clappers for public performances everywhere. The work that had not been started in various regions was promoted by the theater troupe in a few days. During the famine relief, Taihang launched a mutual rescue and mutual assistance movement of "the western front assisting the eastern front" and "the northern front assisting the southern front," especially the movement to assist the disaster-stricken compatriots in the no-man's land of Ling (chuan) and Gao (ping) caused by Chiang Kai-shek and the enemy. The theater troupe specially compiled and performed "Natural and Man-made Disasters" and performed it everywhere. When the audience saw the suffering of their compatriots in the hands of Chiang and the puppets, many people were moved, and many people could not help but throw the dry food they brought onto the stage. According to subsequent investigations, in the villages where the theater troupe had performed, two buckets of grain were automatically taken out by each household, and seven or eight shi of grain by each village. In the rent reduction and interest reduction movement, "Li Youcai's Sayings" performed by the People's Theater Troupe greatly encouraged the peasants who were fighting the landlords. "Changing the Old Style" (compiled by the Guangming Theater Troupe) played a major role in the adjustment of the relationship between cadres and people in Xiangyuan. "Xiao Erhei's Marriage," which was widely performed in the rural areas of Taihang, deeply helped the working people to get rid of the feudal shackles imposed on themselves. The performance of "Li Laicheng's Family" pointed out a path for the liberated peasants to build a new democratic and happy family from the positive side. ......... Over the years, the People's Theater Troupe has been working for the welfare of the people's liberation, so it has been warmly loved and welcomed by the workers, peasants, and soldiers of the entire Border Region. At the Taihang Heroes Conference in 1944 and the Taihang Cultural and Educational Conference in 1945, it won a high reputation.

    Uniting Old Artists  Supporting Village Theater Troupes
    Because the People's Theater Troupe was transformed from an old theater troupe, it has never forgotten to unite old artists and transform old artists. In Xiangyuan, they organized three large book groups (thirteen people) and a blind propaganda group (six people). Whenever there was a major change in the situation or a central work arrangement was made, the theater troupe, the large book group, and the blind propaganda group would coordinate their steps to carry out propaganda. Since this group of old artists was organized, the remote villages of Xiangyuan have heard the sound of drum books full of new content. The masses in the Li and Lu areas liked their singing so much that they specially invited them to sing in the villages.
    In addition, the People's Theater Troupe also helped the growth of village theater troupes in various villages. Every year when the theater troupe held intensive training, the People's Theater Troupe would gather the heads of the village theater troupes to study and rehearse together. After the People's Theater Troupe performed in the village, they tried to help the village theater troupe rehearse as much as possible. Under their enthusiastic support, more than a dozen newly born village theater troupes in Xiangyuan won good praise from the audience, which played a great role in promoting the development of rural mass theater troupes.
    Now, the People's Theater Troupe is returning with the glorious banner. They will have a greater impetus for the rural drama movement. Of course, they themselves have also felt that in the past work, the overall improvement of the troupe in political aspects has been very insufficient and requires greater efforts. We believe that if they can strengthen in this regard, they will grow more quickly among the masses.

　　农村剧团的旗帜
    ——记太行人民剧团的成长
    泽然
    三月二十八日，中央局宣传部召开的戏剧工作者座谈会上，大家一致赞扬着一个剧团；这就是从农村中生长，又全力为农村群众服务的太行人民剧团。连日以来，他们在边区各机关驻地演出作家赵树理名作《李有才板话》、《小二黑结婚》，还演了歌剧《白毛女》和各种农村小型话剧。这些描写农民斗争、歌颂农民翻身的节目，热烈的获得了工农兵群众和干部的欢迎。中央局薄一波同志，对于他们纯熟的表演和把工农兵提高一步的成功，特地送给一面奖旗，称赞他们是：“农村剧团的旗帜”。中央局宣传部除奖给五万元外，还专门召开一次座谈会，交换他们和太行文工团演出的经验，鼓励他们回去后继续努力。
      ★    ★    ★
  耐心的学习  光荣的改造
    这面飘扬在太行人民心目中的农村剧团的旗帜，是在旧戏的基础上，经过耐心的改造后，才生长起来的。
    远在一九三八年夏天，襄垣旧戏班子“富乐意”改成了襄垣农村剧团，这就是人民剧团的前身。当时名目上虽改成了剧团，实际上完全演的是旧戏，旧戏班子的整套作风，旧社会给予他们的腐化、堕落、抽烟、嫖、赌等恶习，一点也没有去掉。四○年，剧团改由民主政府领导，即全部着手改造。首先提出戒大烟，从算账中打通思想，再掀动大家订戒烟计划，提倡互相监督，人人检查。到了三个月，吸烟的人就大为减少。演员陈旦孩，在戒烟中把余下的钱捎回家去，妇夫的感情就迅速转好，旦孩的大烟从此禁绝了。接着剧团开始了整顿内部，废除了东家掌班操纵全团经济大权及干部额外津贴等制度，而代之以经济公开，发扬民主；演员们第一次选举了管理自己生活的经济委员会，改善全团的生活。团内民主生活的开展，又促进了传统师徒关系的动摇。“收下徒弟买下马，由我骂来由我打”的思想完全失掉了威力。当一切都不按照旧秩序行事的时候，激烈的反抗情绪，就不可免的在团内发生了一些偏差：老把式不愿教育青年的思想滋长了，青年也对老把式表现了不尊敬的态度。经过了再进一步的思想教育和检讨，老把式才认识到：从工作出发，应培养后代；演戏没有孩子们配搭，也是不沾的。青年人也懂得了：旧戏里也有好东西，不跟老把式学习，提不高技术，演戏也得不到欢迎。新的认识鼓舞着每个演员，按照自己的角色和需要，自由找老师订学习计划。五天一检查，十天一总结，互相评分，每月总结，展开竞赛，好的奖励。团内互尊互学的热潮，空前掀动起来了。新的热情，新的思想，使剧团在演出上迅速的突破了旧戏的范围，而把崭新的群众斗争题材摄进舞台表演的主要内容。他们发扬了襄垣秧歌传统中优良的一面，又虚心吸收了上党公调、＠＠调及其他各种好的东西。人民剧团就这样走出了襄垣的狭小范围，而在全区获得声誉。剧团的每一个演员，这时第一次感到无上的光荣：“我们已不是过去那种混饭吃的、为娱乐而娱乐的‘戏子’，而是已经成为新社会里为人民服务的宣传战士。”
      ★    ★    ★
    反映群众  教育群众
    为人民服务思想的成长，开始了人民剧团忠实反映群众、教育群众的新经历。
    人民剧团的每一个演员，都是贫苦农民出身的；他们亲身经历过地主阶级的压迫，他们虽然缺少一个基础学校的教育，但他们来自群众，在表现农民感情、表现农民斗争上，的确要比知识分子演员五年或五十年所能做的还要来的深刻。他们就充分发挥了这个熟悉农民群众的条件，在每年春耕、夏耘、秋收的农忙季节，每个演员回家生产的过程中，就把各种生动的题材搜集回来了。这些来自农村、反映群众的戏剧，便最新鲜的吸引了工、农、兵群众的注意力。几年来，人民剧团就这样创作了将近一百个农村剧本和快板。一面虚心向群众学习；一面编演的水平也飞速的提高了。《李有才板话》、《李来成家庭》就是他们编演水平提高的标志。根据赵树理小说编成的《李有才板话》，第一次在群众中演出，并未获得观众的满意；但剧团并未因此而感到灰心；相反，他们却以观众能替他们热烈提供意见而增强了信心和勇气。他们详细搜集各种改进的意见之后，即反复经过四次修改、演出；再修改、再演出；最后，在舞台演出的《李有才板话》终于获得了象赵树理小说一样的声誉。《李来成家庭》的演出，开始也是不成功的；剧团团长李鸣洪、编辑主任李森李、指导员阎德瑾便亲自去李来成家进行调查，从村里进行调查，从邻村进行调查，前后经过十天，写成剧本后，再到村里请他们修改，剧团也搬到村里住了几天，每个演员都向自己要表演的角色本人学习，体会他们的感情和动作，然后才在舞台上演出。这就是轰动了太行而推动了无数模范家庭诞生的《李来成家庭》的成功。人民剧团就是经过这样的道路，把自己的剧作水平，提到了农村剧团一般水平之上。
    这些反映群众的戏剧，很生动的教育了广大农民，去全力服务战争、服务生产，并为反封建、反迷信与建立自己的新生活而奋斗。当四二年前后，正值抗日战争最艰难的岁月里，人民剧团在襄垣农村演出的“换脑筋”，有力的帮助了战争动员，推动了当时的参军入伍，成为热潮。以后演出的“打蟠龙”，又在残酷的“扫荡”与“反扫荡”中教育着各村青壮和民兵，顽强展开麻雀战、窑洞战，积极打击敌人、消灭敌人，去保卫群众财产，保护群众转移。在边沿区，在离敌人碉堡三四里的村庄，《三更放哨》的演出，又唤醒了敌区被蹂躏的人民如何“支应”敌人与掩护抗日；许多伪政权干部，都受到影响，慢慢回头。这对敌后抗日工作给了有力的支援。四三年，太行遭灾旱，民主政府号召大生产，订计划、渡灾荒，当时群众不知从何着手，人民剧团就集中了各村订计划的办法，写成剧本快板，到处公演，各地区没有动起来的工作，剧团几天就推动起来了。渡荒中太行曾掀起“西线援助东线”、“北线援助南线”的互救互助运动，特别是援助陵（川）高（平）一带被蒋介石和敌人造成的无人区的灾难同胞的运动，剧团专门编演了“天灾人祸”，到处出演。当观众看到那里的同胞在蒋伪蹂躏下而妻离子散的苦境时，许多人都被感动了，许多人不自禁的把带来的干粮扔上台去。据以后调查，凡是剧团演过的村庄，每一户两斗，每村七八石的捐助粮食，都自动拿出来了。减租减息运动中，人民剧团演出的《李有才板话》，对和地主斗争的农民起了很大的鼓舞。“转变旧作风”（光明剧团编）又对襄垣干民关系的调整，起了重大的推动作用。在太行农村普遍演出的《小二黑结婚》，深入的帮助了劳苦农民去解脱加在自己身上的封建锁链。《李来成家庭》的出演，又从积极方面给翻身农民指出了一条新民主主义幸福家庭建设的道路。…………几年来人民剧团就这样一直在为人民的解放谋福利，因此它就受到了整个边区工农兵群众的热烈爱戴和欢迎。在四四年太行群英大会上，四五年太行文教大会上，都获得了很高的声誉。
      ★    ★    ★
    团结旧艺人  扶持村剧团
    正因为人民剧团是从旧剧团改造过来的，因此他就一刻也没有忘记：团结旧艺人，改造旧艺人。在襄垣，他们曾经组织了三个大书组（十三人），一个盲人宣传组（六人）。每当时局重大变化，或中心工作布置下来时，剧团和大书组、盲人宣传组，就统一步调进行宣传。自从这批旧艺人组织起来后，襄垣各偏僻小村，就听到了充满新内容的大鼓书声。黎潞一带群众因为他们唱得好，还专门请他们到村里唱。
    此外，人民剧团也很好的帮助了各村村剧团的成长。每年剧团集训时，人民剧团就把村剧团的负责人集拢起来，一起研究，一起排戏。人民剧团到村演出后，又尽量抽时帮助村剧团排演。在他们这样热心扶植下，襄垣有十几个新生的村剧团获得了观众很好的赞扬，这对农村群众剧连的发展起了很大的推动作用。
    现在，人民剧团带着光荣的旗帜回去了。他们对于农村戏剧运动，将有更大的推动。当然，他们自己也已经感到：过去的工作中，全团在政治方面的提高上还非常不够，还须更大的努力。我们相信，他们若能从这方面加强，将会更快的在群众中成长。
