(Reported from Jilu Yu [冀鲁豫] on the 20th) Hua County's districts have been holding farmers' meetings, launching a movement to reverse past injustices and seek revenge, and implementing land reform. Since Hua County was occupied by Chiang Kai-shek's puppet regime in July of last year, landlords and bad elements in the countryside have relied on their power to act tyrannically, reversing grain distribution and land ownership. Now that our army has recovered the area, the masses have seen the light of day again. The Hua County Committee, based on the demands of the masses, has proposed that grievances be redressed, and revenge be sought, to thoroughly eliminate feudalism. In the Third District, a farmers' meeting of 20,000 people was held. At the meeting, the masses discussed and decided to thoroughly settle accounts with the worst landlords who sabotaged the farmers' associations and reversed grain and land distribution, demanding lives for lives. New and old cadres also publicly swore that they would not drink a cup of wine from a landlord, smoke a cigarette from a landlord, or protect a single fruit of their labor. After two days of deliberation, the estrangement between middle and poor peasants was resolved. Everyone recognized that they were a class oppressed by landlords and that they must unite to completely eliminate feudalism. Many middle peasants joined the farmers' association after attending the farmers' meeting.

(Reported from Jilu Yu on the 20th) In Xian Zhuangji, Qingfeng Fifth District, the masses exposed the conspiracies of destructive landlord elements. The democratic government resolutely supported the masses, executing the murderous landlord Gao He Gao to avenge the masses and pay for his crimes with his life. Ge Qiaoyun, the director of the women's association in Xian Zhuangji, was an excellent Communist Party member and very active in the land reform movement. The village's secret agent landlord, Gao He Gao, had long wanted to harm her. One day, he called Tan Erdatou (Qiaoyun's husband) to his opium shop and fabricated rumors, saying, "Your family is holding meetings with the Eighth Route Army every day. Men and women are mixed together, and it doesn't look like a woman. Have the elders ever lost face like this? What's the use of this woman?" Then he asked Erdatou to drink and eat. Although Erdatou's face turned red and pale, he didn't express any opinion. But Gao He Gao saw that Erdatou could be used, and that the couple had always been at odds; Erdatou also had thoughts of changing the world and loved money. During the struggle meeting, he saw Erdatou stop Ge Qiaoyun from speaking. Therefore, five days later, Gao He Gao called Erdatou to his home and said, "If you want me to protect you when the Central Army comes, you must act according to my wishes. First, poison your wife. I can give you 30,000 or 40,000." He immediately took out 10,000 yuan and gave it to Erdatou, and said, "Your Lord Hanshen (Gao He Gao's younger brother) is a high-ranking official in the Central Army. When the Central Army comes, I will guarantee your safety. If you don't do this, you can think about it. In the future, you will not be spared..." With this combination of threats and inducements, he immediately gave Erdatou a package of white arsenic and repeatedly told him, "Don't let the wind get out." One day, Ge Qiaoyun got a little sick, and Gao He Gao told Erdatou to take the opportunity to poison her. But fearing that Erdatou would not handle it properly, he spent another 20,000 yuan to buy Qingxian as an accomplice. He also bought a witch to spread rumors. After Erdatou put the white arsenic in the medicine, Ge Qiaoyun was poisoned but didn't die. Gao He Gao, Erdatou, and the accomplice Qingxian strangled Ge Qiaoyun to death with cloth. Then the witch spread rumors: "It was her fate, this is the revenge of a wronged soul." Another rumor said: "She was angry because she got too little of the struggle fruits." On the surface, Erdatou also cried particularly sadly. No matter how secret the landlords and special agents acted, they could not escape the eyes of the millions of emancipated people. Soon, the murder of Ge Qiaoyun by Gao He Gao, Erdatou, and Qingxian was discovered, and the government immediately arrested the three criminals. When Ge Qiaoyun was being buried, women from the entire district came to a meeting to mourn her. At the meeting, all the women were not only filled with hatred for the landlords and special agents but also had a clear understanding of those witches. Finally, at the request of the masses, the government executed the secret agent landlord Gao He Gao in front of the whole crowd.

　　滑县新区开农民大会组织群众复仇反倒算
    【本报冀鲁豫二十日电】滑县各区分别召开农民大会，展开反倒算复仇运动，贯彻土地改革。该县自去年七月被蒋伪进占后，地主坏蛋在农村仗势横行霸道，倒粮倒地。此次为我军收复，群众重见天日，滑县县委会根据群众要求，提出有冤报冤，有仇报仇，彻底消灭封建。三区召开二万人的农民大会，会上群众讨论决定对破坏农会、倒粮倒地最坏的地主要彻底清算，杀人偿命，新老干部亦纷纷当众宣誓，不喝地主一杯酒，不吸地主一支烟，不包庇一点果实。经两天酝酿，并解开了中贫农之间的隔阂，大家都认识是受地主压迫的阶级，必须大家团结起来，才能彻底消灭封建。许多中农在参加农民大会后，都纷纷加入了农会。
    【本报冀鲁豫二十日电】清丰五区仙庄集，群众揭破坏蛋地主阴谋，民主政府坚决给群众撑腰，枪毙杀人地主高鹤皋为群众复仇偿命。仙庄集妇会主任葛巧云是个优秀的共产党员，在土地改革运动中很积极。该村特务地主高鹤皋很早就想暗害她，一天他把潭二大头（巧云之夫）叫到他烟铺里，造了一些谣言，说：“你家里天天跟着八路军开会，男女混杂不像个女人样子，老辈丢过这人么？这女人要她干啥？”接着让二大头喝酒吃饭，当时二大头虽然被他刺激的脸青一阵红一阵，没表示啥意见，但高鹤皋看出二大头可以利用，且他们夫妇一向不和；二大头又有变天思想又爱财，在开斗争会时，他亲眼看见二大头制止葛巧云发言，因此五天以后，高鹤皋又把二大头叫到他家里说：“要想中央军来时我保护您，要依照我的意见办，先把您的老婆药死，我可以给您三万四万的。”说着立即掏出一万元来给二大头，又说：“你汉臣老爷（高鹤皋之弟）当着中央军的大官，以后中央军来，我保你的险，不这样做，你可想想，那以后对你不能轻饶……。”这样一面威胁一面利诱，随即给二大头白砒一包，并再三嘱咐“千万不要走了风声”。一天葛巧云得了一点小病，高鹤皋叫二大头趁着机会药死她，但又怕二大头办不妥，又花了二万元买动了青献做帮手，另外又买了一个巫婆子专事造谣。二大头把白砒下到药里后，葛巧云中毒未死，高鹤皋、二大头及帮凶青献又用布把葛巧云勒死，接着巫婆传出了谣言：“命该如此，这是冤魂报仇哩。”另外一个谣言说：“斗争果实分给她的少气死的”。二大头表面上也哭的特别悲痛，不管地主、特务做的如何机密，是逃不出千万只翻身人民的眼睛的，很快的高鹤皋、二大头及青献谋害人命的事被发觉了，政府立即将该三犯逮捕。葛巧云出殡时，全区妇女前来开会追悼，大会上全体妇女不仅对地主、特务充满着仇恨，对那些巫婆子也有了个清楚的认识。最后政府在全场群众要求下，枪毙了特务地主高鹤皋。
