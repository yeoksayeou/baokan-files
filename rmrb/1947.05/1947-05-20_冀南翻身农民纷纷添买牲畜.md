[Report from this newspaper's Southern Hebei Bureau on the 18th] Liberated peasants in Southern Hebei are actively buying draught animals in preparation for getting rich this year. After the liberation of Wu Guanying District in Jize, there were only two inferior donkeys. Through last year's production campaign, this number increased to 47 head of cattle by January of this year. To realize the goal of "cultivating three and having a surplus of one," the masses in Xiaozhai Village added 24 head of cattle to their 27 mutual aid teams. Thirteen of the poorest peasant households in Shiqiuzhai Village obtained loans and jointly purchased four head of cattle. Xie Baocai, a veteran of the East Liuxia Village, bought a mule to plough more meticulously. Under the leadership of production model Yin Yuxing, the masses in the Houtouying Village of the Yuan Dynasty engaged in livestock breeding and have already produced four calves this spring. The masses in Qiyangxing Village, Zaoqiang, cooperated to catch fish and sold them for more than 100,000 yuan, which they used to buy two head of cattle. Qu Guoshan, the director of the Fengcun Military Committee, earned 85,000 yuan from weaving baskets and used half of it to buy a head of cattle. Jiudian, Guangzong, has made a plan to buy 15 head of cattle with income from sideline production. Nanliucun Village in Qiu County was a poor village. Under the leadership of labor hero Yuan Zhaolin, they organized nine flour mills, one cotton ginning group, and one cotton fluffing group. Last winter, in just four months, they earned 4.3 million yuan, which they used to buy ten head of cattle before this year's spring ploughing. Li Village Teahouse in Nangong is a small village with 55 households. Originally, there were seven head of cattle, but after the land reform, this number increased to 13. Liu Hengzeng and eight other households in Tongren Village jointly bought four head of cattle and implemented joint ploughing, often saying, "My family has six people and originally had four mu of land. This time, we were given another twenty mu of land through the mass movement. My family also married a daughter-in-law and bought half a cow. I never would have dreamed of this before." In response to the call for production, the masses in Baimu Village, Longping, have recently bought eleven head of cattle and one donkey in just seven or eight days. After receiving loans, the masses in Qianzhangmeng, Ningnan, rushed to buy livestock. Liu Laogong and three others each bought a mule, and Lao Zhan and three others each bought a donkey.
