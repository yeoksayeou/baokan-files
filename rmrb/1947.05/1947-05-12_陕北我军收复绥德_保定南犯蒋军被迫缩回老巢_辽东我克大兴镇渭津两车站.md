Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi Front, May 9th: The Hu troops, who occupied Suide County on the 5th, fled south in panic due to the disastrous defeat at Panlong. The city has been recovered by the Northwest People's Liberation Army.
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi Front, May 10th: The Northwest People's Liberation Army's victory in recovering the important town of Panlong and annihilating the 167th Brigade of Chiang's Hu troops on the night of the 4th has been fully accounted for. A total of 5,713 enemy personnel were captured, including Brigade Commander Li Kungang, Deputy Brigade Commander Tu Jian, Director of the Political Department Chen Xianjin, Chief of Staff Liu Jiechun, Regiment Commander Xiao Bolian, and Deputy Regiment Commander Fu Yutong. 1,400 were killed or wounded. The following was seized: 6 mountain guns, 6 mortars, 3 rocket launchers, 18 60mm mortars, 18 heavy machine guns, 111 light machine guns, 2,328 rifles, 128 Sten submachine guns, as well as short guns, signal guns, and rifle grenades; over 200,000 rounds of ammunition, over 1,000 mules and horses, and 2 cars. One Chiang Kai-shek plane was shot down. In addition to 12,000 bags of flour and 40,000 sets of single-layer uniforms, there were also some military shoes and a large amount of telecommunications equipment.
Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, May 10th: The enemy invading south of Baoding, after being repelled by our forces in Gaoyang on the 2nd of this month, massed along the Dazhuang and Yangqiao line on both sides of the Tang River. On the night of the 2nd, another unit of the Jin-Cha-Ji People's Liberation Army launched an attack on the enemy's rear between Zhuoxian and Gu'an, capturing six strongholds including Gongcun and Cicun, killing and capturing 200 enemy and puppet troops. The soldiers and civilians on both sides of the Tang River also fought bravely, launching continuous attacks for four days and nights. Unable to attend to both the head and tail, the enemy was forced to flee back to the Daxiaozhuguan and Daxiaobaituan area in the southern suburbs of Baoding in panic at 8:00 AM on the 7th. The Dazhuang and Yangqiao line on both sides of the Tang River is now clear of the enemy. The "Nationalist Army South Support," which the Central News Agency clamored about for half a month, has now shrunk back to its lair.
Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, May 10th: A certain unit of the Liaodong Local Corps, active along the Siping-Meihekou line, launched a swift attack on Daxingzhen (30 li northwest of Dongfeng) and Weijin (30 li southeast of Xi'an), two important railway station strongholds of Chiang's army, on the night of the 4th. Their fortifications and nearby railway bridges were completely destroyed. After four hours of fierce fighting, the Chiang Kai-shek troops reinforcing from Xi'an and Meihekou were routed. 234 enemy personnel below the rank of platoon leader were captured, and over 70 enemy personnel below the rank of battalion commander were killed or wounded. Two 60mm mortars, seven light and heavy machine guns, eighty-five rifles, twenty thousand rounds of ammunition, and six telephones were seized.
