(Taoyue News Agency, 22nd) Qinshui County has sown all 60,000 mu of millet land and is now rushing to carry water and point-plant corn. From early April to mid-May, many laborers in the county left to support the front lines, but due to the widespread organization of semi-able-bodied labor, such as in the second district where all twelve administrative villages, with 2,682 households, had 2,522 households participating in mutual aid. Villages such as Wujiagou and Liangzhuang in the third district were 100% organized, and spring plowing was still able to be sown on time, with most areas achieving intensive cultivation. In the Anyuxian Joint Mutual Aid Brigade in the second district, the three administrative villages of Zhangcun, Fengcun, and Lupo applied an average of 65 dan of fertilizer per mu of millet land, an increase of 15 dan compared to last year, and 105 dan of fertilizer per mu of cotton land, an increase of 25 dan compared to last year, and plowed three times. In Wujiagou in the third district, the average application of fertilizer reached 100 dan per mu, which has not been seen for several years. The county's ability to achieve these results this spring is mainly due to solving the problem of equal exchange and settling old accounts of unfair mutual aid from last year. Secondly, village cadres actively took the lead in participating in mutual aid. In addition, there have been many innovations in combining war service and production, generally giving extra points for going on duty. For example, in Zhangmacun, militiamen who went out to participate in the war effort for five days or less received one extra work point per day, and those who went out for more than five days received two extra work points per day. The area of conscripted labor was also expanded to make the burden of conscripted labor more equitable. For example, in the Anyuxian Joint Brigade, men and women, full and semi-able-bodied laborers aged 15 to 16, bear six work points of conscripted labor, and those aged 18 to 45 bear eight work points per person. When going on duty, the amount of work points due is calculated, and wages are paid for overwork and work points are compensated for underwork. There are also three ways to organize military families to participate in mutual aid: (1) The method of exchanging labor for labor, represented by Liangzhuang, Wujiagou, and Guzhen in the third district, organizes all military, cadre, and martyr families into mutual aid groups to work together. Those who work long hours get wages, and those who are insufficient are given preferential treatment by the entire mutual aid group. (2) Based on the full and semi-able-bodied labor and livestock of military, cadre, and martyr families, the amount of self-cultivation and preferential treatment they should receive is determined, and the preferential treatment part is cultivated by the mutual aid group on their behalf. This method is implemented in the entire second district and part of the fourth district. (3) Zhang Jiuming's team in Zhangmacun implemented it, based on the second method, if military, cadre, and martyr families do not want preferential treatment, they are awarded one work point per day.

　　沁水广泛组织半劳力
    播完谷地点种玉茭
    【本报太岳廿二日电】沁水县六万亩谷地全部下种，现正突击担水点种玉茭。从四月初至五月中旬，全县许多劳力出发支援前线，但由于普遍将半劳力组织起来。如二区全区十二个行政村，二千六百八十二户，即有二千五百二十二户参加互助；三区吴家沟、梁庄等村百分之百组织起来，春耕仍能按时下种，大部分地区并且做到精耕细作。二区安育贤联合互助大队所属之张村、冯村、芦坡等三个行政村，谷地每亩平均上粪六十五担，较去年增加十五担，棉花地每亩平均上粪一百零五担，较去年增加二十五担，并犁过三遍。三区之吴家沟，每亩地平均上粪达一百担，为数年所未有。全县今春之所以能获得这些成绩，主要是解决了等价交换问题，清算了去年互助不公的旧账，其次是村干部积极带头参加互助。此外对战勤与生产的结合，也有不少创造，一般作到出差加分。如张马村参战民夫出去五天以内者，每天增工一分，五天以上者，每天增工二分。又扩大支差面积，使差务负担更加公平。如安育贤联合大队，男女全半劳力十五至十六岁者，负担差务六分工，十八至四十五岁者，每人负担八分工，出差时以应出差工算，长出给工资短了补工。对组织军属参加互助问题也有三种办法：（一）以三区梁庄、吴家沟、古镇为代表的工换工办法，将所有军、干、烈属都组织到互助组内，和大家共同劳动，长工者得工资，不足者由全体互助组优待。（二）根据军、干、烈属的全半劳力与畜力的情形，确定其自耕与应受优待数，优待部分由互助组代耕，此一办法为二区全区及四区一部分实行。（三）是张马村张九铭队所实行的，以第二种办法为基础，如军、干、烈属不要优待时，每天奖给一分工。
