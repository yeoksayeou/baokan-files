　　East Anyang Liberated Area

  　New "Ye County" Established
    [This newspaper, Taihang News] Our People's Liberation Army is brave and good at fighting, and has successively conquered Liuyuanji and Cuijiaqiao in Anyang, destroying the lairs of the treacherous bandits Wang Zihui and Guo Qing. The ancient Ye Prefecture, which has been ravaged for more than ten years, has once again seen the light of day and become a pure land of brightness. In order to quickly eliminate the remnants of local stubborn elements and establish a happy and democratic new liberated area, a new county has been established in the area east of Anyang (that is, east of the Pinghan Railway) and south of the Zhang River, named "Ye County", directly under the jurisdiction of Xindianji, Cuijiaqiao, Baibiji, Guocun and other seven districts, with a total of 556 natural villages and approximately 280,000 people in the county.

  　新设“邺县”
    【本报太行讯】我人民解放军英勇善战，连续攻克安阳之柳园集和崔家桥，摧毁奸匪王自会、郭清之老巢，十余年来被蹂躏之古邺郡从此又重见天日，变为一片光明净土。为迅速肃清土顽残余，建立幸福民主之新解放区起见，特将安阳路东（即平汉铁路以东）漳河以南之地区，建立新县，定名为“邺县”，直辖辛店集、崔家桥、白璧集、郭村等七个区，全县共五百五十六个自然村，约二十八万人口。（力工）
