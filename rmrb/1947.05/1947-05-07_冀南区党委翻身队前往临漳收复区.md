　　[This newspaper Jinnan, 5th dispatch] The Jinnan District Party Committee and the Third District Committee have organized a turn-over team to go to the Linzhang recovered area to lead the peasants in their turn-over. The District Party Committee selected eighteen comrades with rich experience in mass work to form a turn-over team, led by Secretary Xing of the Administrative Office. They arrived at the Third District Committee on the 16th, and after Comrade Jiao Shanmin introduced the situation, they set off immediately. The Third District Committee also drew a large number of cadres from the same level organs, and selected sixteen students with relatively rich experience in mass movement work from Taicheng Middle School to form a turn-over team. They began intensive training on the 15th of last month, exchanging experience in turn-over work. Their emotions were very high. Under the slogan of "Helping the masses in the new area to turn-over early," they were led by Comrades Wang Zhixue and Fan Yeping straight to the Huilong area of the Linzhang New Area.
　　[This newspaper Jinnan, 5th dispatch] More than 200 villages in the first, third, and eastern parts of the fourth districts of Pingyuan used to have activities of puppet bandits and miscellaneous groups. Since the Weizhaizi battle in February, after two months of in-depth publicity and education, the situation has gradually opened up, and the broad masses have requested to turn-over. Due to the lack of local cadres, the county and district first held a training class for more than 1,000 peasants from 37 villages in the eastern part of the fourth district. In the morning, based on the peasants' ideological concerns, they combined current affairs education, and in the afternoon, they conducted group discussions to expose grievances and dig up the roots of poverty. The class consciousness of the trainees was raised a step, they recognized who the enemy was, and within seven days after returning to the village, eight key villages in four sub-districts launched liquidation and reasoning struggles against traitors, bullies and evil landlords. When Xin Village struggled against the evil bully landlord Dong Dejiang, 32 households complained; when Qi Village struggled against the puppet village chief Wang Quancheng, more than 40 masses complained. Li Baoyi, the puppet village chief of Qian Lizhuang, the evil bully landlord Pei Hongqing, Fang Huating of Fangzhuang, Zhang Jinzhu of Zhang Laohuzhuang, Ren Shancheng of Po Liuzhuang and other traitorous bully landlords have all been subjected to reasoning and liquidation, and the masses' struggle mood is extremely high.
