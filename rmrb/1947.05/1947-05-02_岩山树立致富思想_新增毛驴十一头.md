[Transmitted by] This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch of the 30th: Yangcheng's Rock Mountain Village first broke through Shangguan Tingkui's fear of wealth ideology, promoted the masses of the whole village to overcome their concerns about getting rich, and competed to purchase livestock and hire long-term laborers to engage in production. During the land reform movement in the village, due to rumors spread by bad elements, coupled with our improper handling of certain issues concerning rich peasants, some of the masses developed doubts about "getting rich." Middle peasant Shangguan Puyun and his wife, who farmed thirteen mu of land, were not touched at all during the mass movement, but he insisted on selling seven mu of land, willing to get money after the autumn harvest. He felt that more land meant a "bigger target" and would "suffer losses" in the future. The leadership took the example of labor hero Shangguan Zhongyou in the village and called on the masses to follow him. Because Tingkui was a basic member of the masses who had just turned over a new leaf with Zhongyou's direct help, he had great faith in Zhongyou. The leadership first started by educating Tingkui, telling him the production stories of Wu Manyou and Shi Zhenming. Tingkui showed admiration, saying, "Chairman Mao is calling on everyone to get rich!" The leadership also compared Shangguan Zhongyou with the old village head Hengyuan – a feudal exploiter. Tingkui said, "Hengyuan always planned to exploit us, but Zhongyou is different from him. He helps solve everyone's difficulties and is always afraid that your life is not going well. Who would be willing to struggle against him?" In this way, Tingkui's thinking became clearer. He launched a discussion on the Shi Zhenming direction within his mutual aid team, acting as the chairman. As a result, everyone spoke out about their thoughts of "waiting," "fear of being struggled against," and "being a basic member of the masses." Shangguan Meiyuan, a 69-year-old middle peasant who was an old man full of feudal superstitions, had never dared to tell anyone his inner thoughts. He didn't even let people see the silkworms he raised every year. He would say he harvested less grain than he actually did, fearing that people would say he had a trick. After this meeting, he took Tingkui's hand and said, "Now I know that the Communist Party is calling on people to get rich. We still have a bunch of silk at home, and we must work hard to produce and get rich in the future." Shangguan Puyun also stopped selling his land. He saw that Shangguan Zhongyou bought a mule and he wanted to buy one too, but he was afraid that people would say he had money and he didn't dare to buy it. Zhongyou saw through his thoughts and immediately lent him three thousand yuan. Puyun said, "I bought the donkey with your money!" Zhongyou said, "Anyway, it's good that you dare to buy livestock." Currently, the village has added a total of eleven donkeys. Zhongyou's team has also bought more than forty sheep. In the past, no one dared to hire long-term laborers, but now families like Tingkui's have also started hiring long-term laborers.

　　岩山树立致富思想
    新增毛驴十一头
    【本报太岳三十日电】阳城岩山村，先打破上官廷魁怕富思想，推动全村群众，克服了怕发财的顾虑，并争购牲口，雇长工大闹生产。该村在土地改革运动中，由于坏分子造谣，加上我们对富农某些问题处理不妥当，部分群众对“发财”发生怀疑，中农上官普云两口人，种十三亩地，在群运中并没有人拔他一根毛，但他非要卖七亩地，情愿秋后要钱。他觉得地多“目标大”将来会“吃亏”，领导上就拿该村劳英上官中有做例，号召群众跟他走。因廷魁是中有直接帮助下刚翻身的基本群众，他对中有非常信仰，领导上就先着手教育廷魁，给他讲吴满有、石振明的生产故事。廷魁显出羡慕之情，他说：“毛主席叫大家发财呀”。领导上并以上官中有与老村长恒元——封建的剥削者来作比，廷魁说：“恒元天天打算剥削咱，中有可和他不同，谁有困难，他都帮助解决，总怕你的日子过不好，谁还肯斗他呢？”这样廷魁思想比较明确了，他在他的互助组内展开讨论石振明方向，他当主席，这一来大家都把“等待”、“怕斗”、“当基本群众”等思想通通说出来了，六十九岁的中农上官每元是个满脑装着封建迷信的老汉，他从未敢把他的内心话告人，连每年养的蚕也不叫人看，粮食打得多，告人说打得少，生怕人说他有法，这次会后他拉着廷魁的手说：“现在我才知道共产党叫人发财，咱家里还存有一把丝，今后可要好好生产发财。”上官普云也不卖地了，他见上官中有买了一头骡，他也想买，但又怕人说他有钱，不敢买。中有看破他的心思，立刻借给他三千元。普云说：“我买驴是借你的钱呀！”中有说：“反正你敢买牲口就好”。现时村中共增加十一条毛驴，中有组中还买了四十多只羊，以前谁也不敢雇长工，现在廷魁等家也雇开长工了。
