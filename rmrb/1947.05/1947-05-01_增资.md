　　Increase Capital
    Xiao Wang
    This is a work by a sixteen-year-old factory apprentice from Dalian, but his portrayal of the struggle for capital increase in the big city is surprisingly insightful. According to the editors of the Dalian Daily, the author, Xiao Wang, is sixteen years old, very short, and used to be a beggar. He used to work in the shop of Xia Tuzi (Baldy Xia) mentioned in the article. Today, on May Day, we are reprinting it specifically, and we hope that our region's worker comrades will also work hard at writing.
                  ——Editor
    Yang Kesheng, guarding his lathe, was pulling the control lever, staring blankly at the rotation of the "electric roller," as if thinking about something....

    Yang Kesheng is already thirty years old this year. Last winter, he received five or six thousand yuan from the allocation store, and he asked Aunt Zhang next door to find him a matchmaker and marry a wife. A few days ago, she gave birth to a little baby for him, but he was not happy, because there was another burden.

    The day before yesterday, Yang Kesheng went to the street to push iron and saw Li Daxiaba (Big-Chin Li), who told him that the "Central" soldiers had arrived in the city, and he should send the money allocated from the allocation store back as soon as possible; otherwise, the "Central" army would come and he would be unlucky. Finally, he told Yang Kesheng to be careful.

    There was no rice or firewood at home, and the salary hadn't been paid. This morning, he borrowed some from Xia Tuzi (the boss's nickname) to tide him over, but as soon as he said it, Xia Tuzi rolled his eyes and said:

    "There isn't a single cent in the till." Who knows! Eating fish and meat all day long! Where did that money come from?…

    "Master Yang, do you think this looks alright?" Little Chen, holding the gear with pliers, came smilingly to ask for advice.

    "Go! I don't care, go find Master Jin!" Yang Kesheng said impatiently. Then he added a little oil to the blade.

    "No rice, no firewood, it doesn't matter if I don't eat, but what about my wife and child?..." These questions kept bothering him. He thought to himself: "How can a man not be able to support a wife and a child? This is entirely fate..."

        ×          ×        ×

    In the evening, on his way home from work, he happened to meet Aunt Li from the Women's Association. She said:

    "Old Yang, your second brother! Are you off work? Your uncle is looking for you, hurry up!" As she said this, she pushed Yang Kesheng along.

    Yang Kesheng passed through a small alley and stepped in some poop. He stomped his foot and cursed, "Who's the son of a bitch who pooped here." He thought this was another bad omen.

    Old Li was mending her torn cotton shoes. When she saw Yang Kesheng coming, she put down her shoes and said:

    "He大哥 (He Dage - respectful term for older male), you've finally come."

    "What's wrong?" Yang Kesheng heard something was wrong and asked anxiously.

    "Sit down and have a smoke first!" Old Li said, handing her pipe to Yang Kesheng.

    "I don't smoke, tell me, what's the matter?"

    "At noon today," Old Li gestured as she spoke, "I came home for lunch, and when I walked to your door, I heard Zhuer's (Yang Kesheng's son's nickname) mother crying and shouting, and the child was also crying. I kicked open the door and went inside. I saw Zhuer's mother had kicked off the quilt and was burning hot, saying she wanted to drink some millet porridge. The child was lying in the bed, his bottom full of runny poop, the bed! The floor! What a mess (埋汰 - dirty)! I quickly came home and found your aunt to cook something and clean up—Your aunt came back after a while and said that there wasn't a grain of rice in your house, not even any cornmeal. When I thought about it, a patient couldn't be allowed to go hungry, so I dug up some of my millet. Just then, Cui Guilan, the president of the Women's Association, came to visit, and your aunt told her about it. She turned around and left, and after a while, she sent eight eggs, four catties of millet, ten catties of cornmeal, plus 1,250 yuan, saying that this was mobilized from the members and buyers to help."

    "Thank you, Uncle, thank you for your help..." Yang Kesheng was so moved that he didn't know what to say.

    "Hey! We are all poor people, we should help each other." Old Li packed a bag of tobacco, lit it, and said, "He Dage, have you been paid yet?"

    "Paid? Today I wanted to draw some money, but Xia Tuzi said there wasn't a single cent in the till, saying that he hasn't been making any money these days."

    "Not making money? What a load of bullshit, who would believe it! The other day, our cooperative went to your place to buy a rice hulling machine, and he wouldn't sell it for less than 80,000; how many days does it take to make a rice hulling machine?"

    "If the materials are complete, it doesn't take four days!"

    "Four workers, each worker earning 300, that's 1,200, plus 25,000 for materials and tools, what else? See, with such a small amount of capital, he earns so much money."

    "Yeah!" Yang Kesheng asked doubtfully, "Then how can he say he doesn't have a penny?"

    "Hey, hey, isn't that his skill! Prices have gone up these days, and wages in all factories have gone up. He has no choice but to raise them, so he came up with this 'poor me' act. When you all get anxious, he takes out the money, saying it's borrowed, and he doesn't need to raise wages. Because you are waiting to use the money, you just make do with it, hey! And that's how you make do."

    "Uncle! How do you know so much about it?" Yang Kesheng was already eight-tenths convinced.

    "It's not that I didn't know," Old Li took a puff of smoke and said, "Yesterday at noon, I went to our district to do some errands and saw Da Lao Li (Big Old Li), Tian Jiaye, Liu Yundong, and some other people from the Chengwan Iron Factory dragging Dong Da Duzi (Big-Bellied Dong) to the district to report him for not paying wages. The district chief asked him to confess properly, and if he didn't confess, he would persuade him. After persuading him for three or four hours, he was finally persuaded and he confessed, and it was almost the same as what I just said."

    "Good! Son of a bitch, I have to settle the score with him!" Yang Kesheng said, wanting to go outside, but Old Li grabbed him and said:

    "Hey! Why are you so reckless? The proverb says: 'A single strand cannot make a thread,' 'A single tree cannot make a forest.' It's absolutely true. If you go like this, he might even bite you back and say: 'Everyone else is fine, it's just you causing trouble.' If that happens, your buddies won't dare to ask for a raise, and that would be terrible."

    "Then how should we ask him for a raise?" Yang Kesheng sat on the edge of the bed, looking at Old Li.

    "Tomorrow when you go to work, tell them what I just told you: how Chengwan's money was raised... those things, ask them if they agree. If they agree, set a time—after eating dinner, ask Xia Tuzi to raise your wages. If he doesn't agree, reason with him..."

    "Big brother! My mom is calling you to eat." Old Li's little daughter came to call Yang Kesheng instead of her brother.

    "Okay! That's what we'll do! Go home and eat."

    Yang Kesheng walked lazily towards his door, thinking about what Old Li had just told him.

    ×          ×    ×

    Yang Kesheng went to work earlier than anyone else today. Xia Tuzi, wearing a leather coat, was urinating. When he saw Yang Kesheng, he didn't say anything. He thought to himself: "Motherfucker, wait until this afternoon…". Little Zhang from the vise came, he was the best one in Xia Tuzi's eyes. When Yang Kesheng told him about the matter, he said, "Our shop really doesn't have any money, you know that, too! Fine! Since you all want him to, then I can't run away either!"

    Then Lao Jin (Old Jin) and Xiao Li (Little Li) from the lathe, and Lao Wang (Old Wang) and Lao Sun (Old Sun) from the vise all came. Yang Kesheng told them all those things, and they all agreed. Finally, he told them:

    "This afternoon, we won't work, we'll do this!"

    After lunch, they all stopped working. They held a meeting in the machine room, discussing who should talk to Xia Tuzi first, who should do what. After discussing it, they went to the back room to find Xia Tuzi. Xia Tuzi was on the bed eating hot pot with his wife. When he saw these "blackies" (the boss's wife's nickname for the workers) barging into the back room, he was furious and asked Yang Kesheng:

    "You are the master, why are you leading them to the back room?"

    Yang Kesheng crossed his arms and said nonchalantly:

    "Today, we all came to ask you for something, will you do it or not?"

    Xia Tuzi saw that Yang Kesheng was not as cowardly as he used to be, and he was three-tenths afraid. He hurriedly smiled and said:

    "Old Yang! We are all old buddies, let's talk it over, please sit down!"

    "No need to be polite," Yang Kesheng sat on the chair on the opposite bed and said: "It's nothing else, the things on the street have gone up these days, and other factories have raised their wages, what about us..."

    "Raise, raise, raise! Definitely raise," Xia Tuzi knew it was about this, because Little Zhang told him in the morning. "But there's no money in the till right now."

    "No money!" Yang Kesheng stood up and pointed at the hot pot and said: "No money, how can you eat hot pot?"

    "Yeah!" Xiao Chen also chimed in.

    Xia Tuzi heard the young brat also "baaing," and thought to himself: "Times have changed." He became furious and said: "Why are you talking so much, you rebel..." He raised his hand to hit him, but Yang Kesheng and Lao Jin grabbed him. When the boss's wife saw two workers grabbing the boss, she cried and shouted, "They're rebelling, they're rebelling, help!..." She threw the bowls and dishes on the table straight to the ground, scaring the workers back. When Yang Kesheng saw that things had come to this point, he grabbed Xia Tuzi's collar with one hand and dragged him out, saying to the workers, "Workers! Don't be afraid! We're doing this for food!"

    Lao Wang and Lao Jin, who had retreated to the door, heard his words and saw him unable to drag Xia Tuzi, so they gathered their courage and stepped forward to help, pulling Xia Tuzi into the courtyard. Xia Tuzi struggled and cursed:

    "Motherfucker, why are you dragging me?..."

    The boss's wife, barefoot, ran out of the house, hugged Xia Tuzi's thigh, refusing to let go, crying and shouting:

    "Old Yang, what's wrong with you...?"

    "Let's go, don't cause 'trouble'! Let's go to the district and reason it out." Yang Kesheng said, pushing him out.

    When the boss's wife saw that they were all gone, she shouted loudly in the yard.

    ×    ×        ×

    Yang Kesheng and a group of six or seven people, arguing and cursing, headed with Xia Tuzi towards the Xinmin District Office. People walking on the road looked at them inexplicably. Some busybodies asked them what they were doing, but they didn't get a satisfactory answer, so they left dejectedly.

    When they arrived at the district office, the guard went in to report, then led them into the district chief's office. The district chief asked them all to sit down and asked them what it was all about. Yang Kesheng told him everything in detail and then said, "District Chief, please judge this matter for us."

    "Alright!" The district chief said. He then asked Xia Tuzi: "So are you planning to give them a raise or not?"

    "There's no money!" Xia Tuzi rolled his eyes and said.

    "Look, he's so stubborn! He's clearly eating hot pot and still says he has no money...," Yang Kesheng said angrily.

    "If you don't raise wages, it won't work."

    "..."

    They all interrupted, making a lot of noise.

    The district chief frowned and said:

    "Hey... Hey! Be quiet for a moment, don't make so much noise; you wait a moment and then talk." The district chief saw that they were all quiet, and then said to Xia Tuzi:

    "Mr. Xia, you need to think more openly. The government's policy of increasing capital is correct. Almost everyone else has already increased their capital."

    "But what can I do if I don't have money?"

    "Hey! Let's not worry about whether you have money or not. You first need to understand the reason for increasing capital." The district chief took out a cigarette, lit it, and then took out four or five more to distribute to them. He took a puff and said:

    "Now the democratic government advocates increasing workers' capital, not to support the workers and let them take the money and do whatever they want, or to bully the bosses, right? It's not like that, you need to understand. Instead, after the capital is increased, the workers will produce even harder, because they won't have to worry about food and clothing. This will also help your shop to produce more and earn more, which is a great help to all factories. Doesn't that equal solving the difficulties for the people!"

    Xia Tuzi gradually understood a little and asked:

    "After the capital is increased, can you guarantee that they will work hard?"

    "Why not? Haven't you seen the news about selecting model workers? That's because they don't have to worry about food and clothing, and there are clubs for them to play in. Their lives have all improved, and they have all exceeded the production plan. Also, your peers at Chengwan's house, after increasing their capital, have reportedly earned more than 20,000 yuan in just two or three days!"

    Xia Tuzi had initially recognized the reason for increasing capital and was very ashamed of being so stubborn before, so he said to the district chief:

    "District Chief, I only understand now. I will go back and increase their capital!" His face was red, and he lowered his head.

    Yang Kesheng and the others saw that Xia Tuzi understood, and smiles appeared on their faces.

    "Good, you go back with the boss! After the capital is increased, you must work harder!" The district chief finally instructed Yang Kesheng and the others.

    "Okay, we will definitely work hard."

    So they happily went back with Xia Tuzi to increase the capital.

    ×    ×    ×

    It was the afternoon of the third day after the capital was increased.

    In the machine room, apart from the "hissing" sound of the machines, no other sound could be heard. People were working beside their machines, and no one was even smoking. Yang Kesheng was in the accounting room, diligently drawing machine drawings on the blueprint.

    "Is Boss Xia at home?" A person dressed as a businessman came in and asked Xiao Chen from the vise near the door.

    Xia Tuzi was weighing iron in the backyard. When he heard someone looking for him, he came out and saw that it was Boss Cheng from the Tongliyong Cigarette Factory. He greeted him warmly: "Old Cheng, when did you come? Is business good? Haha..."

    "Hey! Haha! I just came, are you busy?" Boss Cheng also stepped forward and chatted enthusiastically.

    "Come in and sit down..." Xia Tuzi said, leading the way.

    "No need, I want to talk to you about something. Are you busy right now?" Boss Cheng's face changed from a smile to a serious expression.

    "It's not too busy; do you have any work?"

    "Yes, but I'm afraid you can't do it."

    "What work?"

    "One of the cigarette-cutting machines in our factory is broken, and I want to find two masters to repair it. I've been looking for a while, but everyone else is busy; hey! What bad luck! I need to pick up the cigarette silk tomorrow afternoon, hey!" Boss Cheng frowned, but after a while, he seemed to have come up with an idea: "Boss Xia, please help me, I'm not afraid to pay more for the repair, let's talk about the price first, 20,000! Is that okay?"

    When Xia Tuzi heard this huge price, his eyes were already red, but he didn't dare to take on this job, because the masters were sleeping at home, and he didn't know if they could work the night shift. Looking at 20,000, he didn't dare to accept it, and he stood there scratching his bald head. Should he accept it? But he was afraid he couldn't do it. If he didn't accept it? It was too bad. He couldn't answer for a long time, and Boss Cheng asked anxiously, "Is it okay?"

    Yang Kesheng heard about this in the accounting room, and seeing that Xia Tuzi was just scratching his head and not saying anything, he was afraid that this job would be "ruined," so he put down his pencil and ran out, quickly asking Boss Cheng:

    "Okay, okay! Where is the machine?"

    "In our factory!"

    "Lao Jin, Lao Wang, pack up and get your tools ready, let's go!" Yang Kesheng instructed Lao Jin and Lao Wang in a row, while finding his own tools.

    "Old Yang! What about that job?" Xia Tuzi asked very concerned.

    "It doesn't matter, we'll just work a little harder tomorrow and we'll have it. This job is important, it's a once-in-a-decade thing, there's no good job like this on ordinary days, don't you think? Haha..."

    "Isn't that right! Haha... Hey! Shall we go?" Lao Wang said with a smile.

    "Let's go!" Yang Kesheng, Lao Jin, and Boss Cheng said in unison. When Xia Tuzi saw that the workers were all very excited, he was also excited and said:

    "Hey! Wait, I'll go too!" After he finished speaking, he chased after them.

    When they arrived at the Tongliyong Cigarette Factory, Boss Cheng led them to a cigarette-cutting machine room, pointed and said:

    "This is the one!"

    Yang Kesheng, Lao Wang, and Lao Jin looked around the machine, found the problem, and then took up their tools and worked "fast."

    When Xia Tuzi saw this scene, he was deeply moved.

　　增资
    小王
    这是大连一个十六岁的工厂学徒的习作，但他对大城市增资斗争的刻画，是使人惊喜的。据大连日报编者介绍，作者小王，现年十六岁，个子很低，作过讨饭的叫花子，就在文中所写夏秃子的铺子里工作过。今日五一节，特为转载，并希望我区工人同志，也来努力写作。
                  ——编者
    杨克生守着床子（旋床子）撤着掉杆，眼死盯着“电滚儿”的转动发怔，好像在想什么……。
    杨克生今年已经三十了，去年冬月从配给店分了五、六千块，就托隔壁张大娘给提个媒，娶了个老婆。前几天她给他生了个小宝宝，他并不欢喜，因为又多了个负担。
    前天杨克生上街推铁，看见李大下巴，对他说“中央”大兵已经到城子里了，从配给店分到的钱趁早送回去；若不，“中央”军来了一定倒霉，最后还告诉杨克生要小心点。
    家里面子和柴都没有了，饷也没开，他今儿早晨跟夏秃子（老板外号）先借几个，垫补垫补，可是当他一说，夏秃子把眼皮一翻说道：
    “柜上一个子也没有了。”鬼晓得！成天吃的鱼啊！肉啊！那弄的钱？……
    “杨师夫，你看这样子行不行？”虎钳子的小陈，拿着牙轮，笑嘻嘻来请教。
    “去！我不管，找金师夫去！”杨克生不耐烦的说。接着又在刀口上加了一点油。
    “米、柴都没有，自己不吃饭没关系，老婆和孩子呢？……”这些问题老纠缠在他的脑子里。心里想：“凭着一个汉子，还养不活一个老婆一个孩儿，这完全是命……”
        ×          ×        ×
    晚上放工回家，正好碰见了妇女会的老李大婶，她说道：
    “老杨他二哥！放工了吗？你大叔找你，你快去吧！”说着就推着杨克生走。
    杨克生穿过了小胡同踏了一脚屎，他跺了跺脚骂道：“那个鳖崽子屙的。”他以为这又是不祥之兆。
    老李正在掌着破棉鞋，一见杨克生来了。就放下了鞋说道：
    “他大哥你可来了。”
    “怎么的了？”杨克生一听话不对，急忙的问。
    “你先坐下吃袋烟吧！”老李说着就把自己的烟袋递给了杨克生。
    “我不吃，你说吧，有什么事？”
    “今儿晌午”，老李一边比划一边说“我来家吃晌饭，走到你门口，听见柱儿（杨克生儿子的乳名）他妈又哭又喊，孩子也哭，我就撞开了大门，进去一看，见柱儿他妈把被子都蹬了，热的要命，说要点小米粥喝，孩子在炕里边躺着，腚底下一泡稀屎，炕啊！地啊！糟的那个“埋态”（即脏肮之意）。我就赶快来家，把你大婶找去做点饭收拾——。你大婶去了不一会儿回来说，你家一粒米也没有了，连苞米面子都干净了。我一想病人可不能叫她饿着，就把俺小米子挖了一点，正在这时，妇女会会长崔桂兰来串门，你大婶就把这事告诉了她，她转身就走了，不一会他送来了八个鸡蛋，四斤小米，十斤苞米面子，外加上一千二百五十块钱，她说这是动员会员和买卖家帮助的。”
    “谢谢大叔，多帮忙了……”杨克生被感动的不知说什么好。
    “咳！咱们都是穷人，应当帮忙。”老李装了一袋烟点着了说“他大哥你开饷了没有？”
    那开了！今儿个我想支点钱，夏秃子说柜上一个子也没有，说这几天不挣钱。”
    “不挣钱？真他妈瞎扯鸡巴蛋，谁信！前儿个，我们合作社，上你们那买一架打粳机，少八万不卖；你说造一架打粳机得几天？”
    “材料齐的话，不用四天！”
    “四个工，一个工打算三百，三四一十二、一千二，材料和用具打算两万五，还有什么？你看就这么点本钱就挣那么些钱。”
    “是啊！”杨克生半信半疑的问道：“那怎么他说一个钱也没有呢？”
    嗨嗨这是人家的本领吗！这几天的东西都涨了，各工厂的工钱都涨了，他不涨不行，所以他就来了这一套“哭穷”，等你们大伙要急眼的时候，他才把钱拿出来，说是借的，也不用涨钱，你们因为等着用，就三凑付两凑付，嗳！就凑付上了。”
    “大叔！你怎么知道这么详细呢？”杨克生已有八分信了。
    “不是我也不知道”，老李抽了口烟说道：“昨儿个晌午我到咱区上办事，看见成万铁工厂的大老李、田家业、刘云动他们那一些人，把董大肚子抓到区上，告他为什么不开饷。区长就问他，叫他好好的坦白，他不坦白就劝，劝了三、四个钟头，才给他说服了，他坦白了，和我刚才说的差不多。”
    “好！他妈的非找他算账不可！”杨克生说着就想往外走，被李老一把拉住说：
    “咳！你这人怎那么毛楞呢？俗语说：‘单丝不成线’，‘孤木不成林’。一点也不假，你这么一去，人家还倒来咬你一口说：‘人家不怎么的，就你挑皮。’这么一来，你们那些伙计也不敢要求涨钱了，那可就糟了。”
    “那怎么样要求他涨钱呢？”杨克生坐在炕沿边，瞅着老李。
    “你明天一上工，就把我刚才告诉你的：成万家怎么涨的钱……那些事告诉他们，问他们同意不同意，若是同意，就定了时间——吃完饷，就跟夏秃子要求他涨钱，若不答应就和他说说理……”。
    “大哥！俺妈叫你去吃饭。”老李的小老姑娘代兄来叫杨克生。
    “好！就这么办！你家去吃饭吧。”
    杨克生懒洋洋的往自己门口走，边走边想老李方才对他讲的事。
    ×          ×    ×
    杨克生今天上工比谁都早，夏秃子披着皮大衣撒尿，见着杨克生什么也没说，他心里想：“奶奶个×的，过晌瞧……”。虎钳子的小张来了，他在夏秃子眼睛里是最好的一个，当杨克生把那事告诉了他时，他说：“咱们柜上本来就没有钱吗，你也不是不知道，好！既然你们大伙要求他，那我也跑不了啊！”
    接着旋床子的老金小李虎钳子的老王老孙都来了，杨克生把那些事告诉他们，他们都赞成。最后他告诉他们说：
    “下晌不干活了，就干这个！”
    吃完了午饭，果然都停工了，他们在机械房里开着会，核计着谁先和夏秃子说，谁干什么，核计好了就到后屋找夏秃子了。夏秃子在炕上正和老婆吃着火锅，一看这些“黑子”（老板娘给伙计们取的外号）撞进后屋来就大怒问杨克生道：
    “你当师夫的，为什么领他们到后屋来？”
    杨克生把两臂一抱，满不在乎的说道：
    “今天我们大伙来要求你点事，你说行不行吧？”
    夏秃子一看杨克生不像往日那样熊了，就有三分骇怕，急忙陪笑说道：
    “老杨！咱们都是老伙计了，有话好说，你请坐吧！”
    “不客气”，杨克生坐在对炕那张椅子上说：“没有别的，这几天街上的东西都涨了，别的工厂也涨钱了，咱们呢……”。
    “涨涨涨！一定涨”，夏秃子早知道为这事，因为早晨小张告诉他了。“可是现在柜上没有钱。”
    “没有钱！”杨克生站起来指着火锅说：“没有钱怎么吃火锅子？”
    “是啊！”小陈也接着说。
    夏秃子一听小崽也来“巴巴”，心里想：“倒是年头变了”就大怒道：“你多什么嘴，反了……”举手就想打，被杨克生和老金一把拉住，老板娘一见两个伙计把掌柜的拉住，就大哭大喊道：“反了反了，救人啊！……”她把桌子上的碗碟直往地扔，把伙计们吓的直往后退。杨克生一见事情已到这步田地了，就一手抓住夏秃子的领子，往外拖，对伙计们说道：“伙计们！不用怕！我们这是为吃饭哪！”
    将退到房门口的老王和老金他们，听完了他的话，又见他拖不动夏秃子，就鼓了鼓勇气，上前帮助，把夏秃子拉到院里，夏秃子挣扎着骂道：
    “妈个臭×的，你们拖我干什么？……”
    老板娘赤着脚，从屋里跑出来，抱住夏秃子的大腿，死不放松，大哭大喊：
    “老杨啊！你们怎么啦……？”
    “走吧，别找‘别扭’了！到区上讲讲理去。”杨克生说着就往外推。
    老板娘一看他们都走了，就在院子里狠命的喊叫着。
    ×    ×        ×
    杨克生一行六、七个人，吵着骂着同夏秃子奔向新民区公所。道上走路的人，都莫明其妙的望着他们，有好事的人问他们这是干什么？可是没得到圆满的答复，便无精打彩的走了。
    走到区公所，门岗进去通报一声后，把他们领进区长的屋子里，区长让他们都坐下，问他们为什么事，杨克生便一五一十的学给他听，随后说：“区长，你给俺们判一判这事。”
    “好吧！”区长说。又问夏秃子：“那你打算给不给他们涨钱呢？”
    “没有钱吗！”夏秃子把眼一翻说。
    “你看，他嘴这么硬！明明火锅子吃着还说没有钱……，”杨克生发了火说。
    “不涨钱不行”
    “……”
    他们都插了嘴，哄哄嚷嚷的闹成了一片。
    区长皱了皱眉头道：
    “嗳……嗳！静一下，别吵吵了；你们等一下子再说吧。”区长见他们都静了，便向夏秃子道：
    “我说夏先生，你要想开一点，政府增资的政策是对的，别家差不多早就增资了。”
    “那我没有钱怎么办？”
    “嗳！咱们先别管有没有钱，你先要把这增资的道理明白了。”区长拿出了一枝烟卷，点着了，又拿出了四、五根分给他们。他抽了一口说：
    “现在民主政府主张工人增资，并不是给工人撑腰叫工人把钱拿去，愿干活不干活，或是欺负掌柜的了吧？并不是这样子，你要明白了。而是增了资后，工人更加劲的生产，因为他们不愁吃穿了，这样一来，对你柜上也能多出活、多挣，这样对各厂都有很大的帮助，那不就等于给老百姓解决了困难一样吗！”
    夏秃子渐渐被说的明白一点的问：
    “增完资后，管保他们能好好的干活吗？”
    “怎么不能呢？你没有看报上登着选劳动模范吗？那就因为他们不愁吃穿，还有俱乐部供他玩的地方。他们的生活都改善了，他们都超过了生产计划。再有你们同行的成万家，增了资后，听说就两三天的工夫，多挣了两万多元呢！”
    夏秃子已经初步的认识了增资的道理，很惭愧早先那样顽固，就对区长说道：
    “区长，我现在才稍稍的明白了。我回去给他们增资吧！”他的脸通红，低下了头。
    杨克生他们见夏秃子明白了，脸上浮上了笑容。
    “好，你们跟掌柜回去吧！增了资后，可要多加劲的干活吧！”区长最后对杨克生他们嘱咐了一句。
    “好了，我们一定好好的干。”
    于是他们很快乐的跟夏秃子回去增资了。
    ×    ×    ×
    是增了资后第三天的下午。
    机器房里除机器“唏啦哗啦”的响着外，听不见别的声音，人们都守着自己的机器旁工作着，连个抽烟的都没有。杨克生在账房里，用心的在图纸上画着机器图样子。
    “夏老板在家吗？”进来个商人打扮的一个人，问着靠门口虎钳子的小陈。
    夏秃子在后院秤着铁，听有人找他，便出来一看，原来是同利永烟卷工厂的程老板，便亲热的打着招呼：“老程什么时候来的？买卖好吧？哈哈……”
    “嗳！哈哈！才来，忙吧？”程老板也凑上前热烈的谈笑着。
    “来！进屋坐坐……”夏秃子边说边让着。
    “不用了，我跟你说点事，你们现在活忙不忙？”程老板的脸从笑容变成严肃了。
    “可也不怎么忙；有什么活吗？”
    “有，就怕你们干不了。”
    “什么活？”
    “我们厂子里的切烟丝子的机器坏了一台，想找两个师夫去给修理修理，找了有时候，别家都挺忙；咳！真倒霉！明天下午就来拿烟卷丝子了，咳！”程老板愁眉不展的，不一会儿好像想出办法似的：“夏老板，你帮帮忙吧，不怕多给修理费，先说价，两万！行不行？”
    夏秃子一听见这巨大的价钱，早眼红了，可是他不敢接这份活，因为师夫们在家睡，就不，人家也不知能不能打夜班呢？眼看着两万，不敢接，楞在那地方直挠秃光光的头，接吧？又怕不能干。不接吧？又太可惜了。老半天不能答复，程老板急的一劲的问：“行不行？”
    杨克生在账房里听见了这事，见夏秃子光挠头没吭气，恐怕这活弄“荒”了，就放下了铅笔跑出来，连忙的问程老板道：
    “行，行！机器在那呢？”
    “在我们厂子呢！”
    “老金、老王，收拾收拾把家伙预备好了，走！”杨克生一连吩咐老金和老王，一边把自己的家伙找好。
    “老杨！那份活呢？”夏秃子很关心的问。
    “不要紧，明儿个多加点劲干就有了，这个活要紧，十年九不遇的事，平常日子那有这个好活，你们说是不是？哈哈……。”
    “可不是吗！哈哈……嗳！咱们走吧？”老王笑着说。
    “走！”杨克生、老金、程老板异口同音的说。夏秃子一见伙计一个个很兴奋，他也兴奋的说：
    “嗳！等着，我也去！”说完也撵上了他们。
    走到了同利永烟卷工厂，程老板把他们领到一台切烟叶的机器房，指着说：
    “就是这台！”
    杨克生、老王、老金他们朝那机器看了一周，查出了毛病后，就拿起来家伙“刷刷”的干的“风快”。
    夏秃子一看这光景，深深感动了。
