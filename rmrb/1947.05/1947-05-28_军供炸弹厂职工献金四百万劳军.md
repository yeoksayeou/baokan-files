　　Ordnance Factory Workers Donate Four Million to Comfort the Troops
    [Our Newspaper] In the production increase emulation campaign, the ordnance factory has set off another wave of donating money to comfort the troops. At the end of last month, Director Zhang took the lead in donating money on the spot at the general meeting of all employees, and mobilized everyone by saying, "We should take out our most beloved things to donate to the soldiers at the front, because what we love most, the soldiers will definitely love too." Comrade He Zhengyi, a forty-eight-year-old administrator, said, "I am a veteran cadre of the Long March. I have saved a total of 50,000 yuan from joining the army to now. I am reluctant to spend it, and I planned to use it for marriage, but in order to defeat Chiang Kai-shek quickly, I will take it all out to donate to the soldiers at the front." Craftsman Zhang Fuxing eagerly challenged everyone and also donated 25,000 yuan. Li Xiaosan, who responded first, also donated 25,000 yuan. Young apprentice Wang Yongle said: I donate four months' salary, I don't need anything except food, and I will send it all to the front. Chang Hu said: I will also donate three months' salary. Zhao Moying, a family member of a worker, donated 1,500 yuan. Many other comrades also rushed to sign up to donate money, ranging from 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. A total of 2,021,132 yuan was donated. The news of the donation quickly spread to the sand turning department, and the workers immediately caused another sensation. They also enthusiastically donated money. The total donation of the whole factory was more than 3,945,000 yuan.
