Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, May 5th: Reports from various sources: The French government's continued suppression policy in Vietnam, and especially the recent economic measures and wage restriction policy, have aroused strong opposition from Communist ministers and progressive cabinet members, causing the French political situation to worsen. The cabinet held both formal and informal meetings (the latter without the participation of the French Communist ministers) within one day and night. During the meetings, Prime Minister Ramadier insisted on continuing his wage restriction policy, leading to no agreement. Prime Minister Ramadier will report the current situation to the National Assembly and request a vote of confidence from the Chamber of Deputies.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, May 4th: Paris dispatch: The strike at the Renault factory has become the fuse for the French workers' wage increase movement, which is currently expanding. The wage increase movement was triggered by high prices. According to French Communist leader Duclos, current prices are 738 percent of those in 1939, while wages are only 400 percent of what they were then. Therefore, the situation of the working class has deteriorated. According to Hainaut, Secretary-General of the Paris Regional Trade Union Federation, the capitalists' profits have not only not decreased but have more than tripled. Thorez's May Day speech on the wage issue was not only welcomed by the workers but also received attention and praise from all sides. Agence France-Presse stated: "Most political observers in Paris interpret Thorez's speech as meaning that the Communists do not want to create a crisis." The agency also stated: "Economists agree that if wage increases are accompanied by increased production, the current economic experiment will not be threatened." The agency believes that Thorez's speech "is clearly an attempt to mediate and eliminate the differences between those who advocate continuing the current wage policy (Popular Republican Movement, Radical Socialist Party, and Socialist Party) and those who advocate wage increases (Communist Party and General Confederation of Labor)." Amidst the calls for wage increases, only reactionary politicians representing the big bourgeoisie are making strange noises, such as Finance Minister Soustelle's (belonging to the Popular Republican Movement) "arguments." Soustelle, putting the cart before the horse, said: "General wage increases will immediately increase prices and will lead to insurmountable difficulties." The wage increase issue is currently being discussed in detail by the French cabinet and the National Assembly.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, May 4th: Agence France-Presse reported: On May Day, the Place de la Concorde in Paris was filled with a platform covered with French flags, with the words "French People's Congress for the Defense of Republican Freedom" written on it. When the members of the Communist Party Steering Committee stepped onto the platform, the masses shouted for Thorez to take power and cheered loudly. Thorez delivered a speech stating: The French working class paid a huge sacrifice in liberating the motherland and has since launched a battle of production. The working class understands that their interests lie in the salvation of the motherland, not in leading the country to fascism. Thorez called for further reductions in the budget (especially the budget for the armed forces). He continued: The French workers are determined to continue their efforts, but they demand more reasonable remuneration for their work. He said: This is indispensable, and it can be resolved by the bonus of production. Everyone must understand that the heaviest burden is on the working class. Thorez attacked the colonialists, saying: We must try to achieve friendship with the nations of the French Federation and avoid any war of aggression. Thorez concluded: The friendship forged during the Great War for common victory must be maintained in peacetime.

　　反动派坚持限制工资
    法国政局趋于严重  工人增资运动扩大
    【新华社陕北五日电】各方报导：由于法国政府仍未改变对越南的镇压政策，特别由于政府近来的经济措施及限制工资政策，引起共产党各部长及进步阁员的坚决反对，法国政治局势趋于严重。一日夜内阁曾举行正式会议与非正式会议（后者法共各部长未参加），总理拉马第于会议中坚持继续施行其限制工资政策，致使会议未获任何协议。总理拉马第将向国会报告目前情势，并要求众院举行信任投票。
    【新华社陕北四日电】巴黎讯：雷诺工厂的罢工，已成为法国工人增资运动的引线，这一运动目前正在扩大中。增资运动起因于物价的高昂。据法共领袖之一杜克洛称：目前物价为一九三九年的百分之七百三十八，而工资仅为当时的百分之四百。因此，工人阶级的情况是恶化了。又据巴黎区职工联盟总书记海纳甫称：在资本家方面，他们的利润不但没有减少，而且已超过三倍。多列士五一节关于工资问题的演说，不仅受到工人的欢迎，而且受到各方面的重视与好评。法新社称：“巴黎多数政治观察家，都解释多列士的演说意味着共产党人并不愿造成危机。”该社又称：“经济学家们同意假如增资伴随着增产，现行经济实验是不会受到威胁的。”该社认为多列士的演说，“显然是企图调解与消弭主张继续现行工资政策的人们（人民共和运动、急进社会党与社会党）与主张增资的人们（共产党与总工会）之间的分岐。”增资声中，只有代表大资产阶级的反动政客们发出奇怪的调子，财长苏曼（属人民共和运动）的“论据”即其一例。苏曼倒因为果的说：“一般增资将使物价立即上涨，并将引向无法克服的困难。”刻增资问题正由法阁及国民议会在详尽讨论中。
    【新华社陕北四日电】法国新闻社报导：五一节的巴黎孔科德广场中矗立着一座布满法国旗帜的讲台，上面写着一法国人民保卫共和自由大会。”当共产党指导委员会各委员登上讲台时，群众高喊要求多列士掌政，并大声欢呼。多列士发表演说称：法国工人阶级在解放祖国中间曾支付了巨大的牺牲，并从那时起发动了生产的战斗。工人阶级了解到他们的利益在于祖国的拯救，而不在于将使国家走向法西斯。多列士号召进一步减少预算（特别是武装部队的预算）。继称：法国工人已决心继续他们的努力，但他们要求得到更合理的工作报酬。他说：这是不可或缺的，这是可以用生产品的红利来解决的。每个人必须了解，最沉重的负担是背在工人阶级的身上。多列士抨击殖民主义者称：我们必须设法获致法国联邦各民族的友谊，并避免任何侵略战争。多列士结语称：在大战时期为了共同胜利而锤炼出来的友谊，必须在和平时期保持下去。
