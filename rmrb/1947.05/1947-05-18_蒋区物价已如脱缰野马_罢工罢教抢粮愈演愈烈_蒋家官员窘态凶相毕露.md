Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th: Comprehensive reports indicate that amidst soaring prices, rice riots, and waves of strikes and teaching strikes in the Chiang-controlled areas, the Chiang family officials have fully exposed their flustered embarrassment and barbaric shamelessness. Chiang's Executive Yuan President Zhang Qun lamented again at the Senate on the 9th that prices were like a runaway horse and could not be controlled. He said that due to empty coffers from the civil war, it was impossible to resolve the issues of unfreezing workers' cost of living index and improving the treatment of public employees, teachers, and soldiers. To shirk responsibility, Zhang Qun launched a massive attack on Song Ziwen, believing that the price storm was caused by the China Textile Company's rush to purchase cotton. Frightened by the anger of Shanghai workers and citizens, Chiang's Shanghai Mayor Wu Guozhen hurriedly returned from Nanjing on the 11th after seeking instructions. Besides having no solution, he clamored to take strict sanctions against the masses. He refused to unfreeze the workers' cost of living index, demanding that workers "sacrifice," "otherwise the factories (should read as the four major families) cannot bear it." "[That] would be the enemy of all Shanghai citizens (should read as the four major families and their lackeys)." Regarding the high rice prices, he shamelessly said that it was "fearing that rice prices were too low, causing cheap grain to hurt farmers." Chiang's Jiangsu Province Chairman Wang Maogong also hastily came forward to receive reporters, warning them not to report on rising prices. But no matter how flustered, lamenting, barbaric, or shameless the Chiang family officials are, rising prices and various disturbances and waves are intensifying.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: According to an Associated Press Shanghai dispatch: The Shanghai strike is still continuing. Three thousand department store employees held a demonstration demanding unconditional unfreezing of the wage index. The Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions also supports this demand. The strike of 1,500 telecommunications employees demanding wage increases has entered its fourth day, but "there is still no solution in sight." Although some rice shops have now reopened, they are selling very little because buyers are unwilling or unable to pay the high price of 280,000 Chiang currency per "shi".
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th: The soaring prices in the Chiang-controlled areas have caused universities to successively launch teaching and class strikes. According to the Central News Agency: After the professors' association of Nanjing Central University jointly petitioned, students from various departments and faculties held a representative conference, demanding an increase in food subsidies, and began a strike on the 12th to petition the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Education. The Central News Agency also claimed that professors at Northeast University in Shenyang, due to high prices and inability to maintain their livelihoods, and the authorities' failure to adjust, began a three-day teaching strike on the 13th to protest.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: According to the Central News Agency: Professors at Nanjing Central University, due to the hardship of life and inability to maintain it, received Chinese and foreign reporters at the school on the 12th. At the meeting, Zheng Ji, Liu Guangyun, Jiang Lianggui, Wu Shichang, and other professors, as standing directors of the school's professors' association, spoke one after another, saying: Central University professors have remained steadfast in their posts during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, enduring all kinds of hardships without complaint. Now, nearly two years after victory, education has not received the attention it deserves, and educational funding accounts for only 3.7 percent of the total national expenditure. When Central University returned to its original location, it applied for US$20,000 in foreign exchange to purchase books and instruments, but there have been no concrete results. As a result, no smoke comes out of the chimneys in the practice factory, and the machines have not turned. In the farm, there are only scrawny Dutch cows struggling with hunger. In terms of working conditions, it is almost impossible to start; in terms of living conditions, it is even more pitiful. A small room is used for accommodation, dining, and receiving guests, and those with many children feel even more cramped. Compared with the employees of China Textile, China Merchants, and the Four Banks (all private property occupied by the four major families), the disparity in their living standards is indeed incomparable. It was also said that the school's professors had twice sent people to the newly appointed Chiang's Executive Yuan President Zhang Qun to petition for improved living conditions, but without any results.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: According to Central News Agency: In the Shanghai-Hangzhou one-day rice robbery and strike, students at Yingshi University in Jinhua, Zhejiang, had a student movement due to the "relocation" issue. (The Chiang family authorities unreasonably wanted the school to relocate, and the students were unwilling.) More than 500 students attempted to travel to Nanjing by train to petition, but failed. They occupied the station, and traffic on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line was cut off. On the morning of the 9th, the students loaded their luggage onto two armored carriages, took turns pushing them, and marched along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road on foot. The Railway Bureau then dismantled a section of the railway between Changan Station and Jianqiao Station. The situation became serious for a time. Chiang's Ministry of Education hurriedly sent Vice Minister Hang Liwu to Hangzhou, threatening to disband the school to threaten the students, but the students remained in Hangzhou until the 12th, insisting on their demands.

　　蒋区物价已如脱缰野马
    罢工罢教抢粮愈演愈烈
    蒋家官员窘态凶相毕露
    【新华社陕北十五日电】综合报导：在蒋管区物价猛涨，米骚动及罢工罢教风潮中完全暴露了蒋家官员们手忙脚乱的窘态与蛮横无耻的凶相。蒋记行政院长张群九日在参政会上再次哀鸣物价已如脱缰之马，无法控制；对于解冻工人生活费指数，改善公教人员及官兵待遇，因内战经费空虚，无法解决。张群为推卸罪责，对宋子文大肆攻击，认为此次物价风波系由中纺公司抢购棉花所造成。被上海工人及市民的愤怒吓慌的蒋记上海市长吴国桢十一日急忙自南京请示归来，除一切毫无办法外，叫嚣将对群众采取严厉制裁。他拒绝解冻工人生活指数，要工人“牺牲”，“否则工厂（按应读为四大家族）不胜负担。”“即为我全上海市民（按应读为四大家族及其走狗）之敌。”对于米价高涨，则竟无耻的说是“恐米价过贱，造成谷贱伤农”。蒋记江苏省主席王懋功也慌忙亲自出马招待记者，警告不准报导物价高涨。但不管蒋家官员们怎样慌张、哀鸣、蛮横、无耻，物价上升及各种骚动和风潮正在愈演愈烈。
    【新华社陕北十四日电】据美联社上海电：上海罢工仍在继续，三千名百货商店的雇员举行示威，要求无条件的解冻工资指数。上海工会也支持这一要求，一千五百名电讯员工要求增资之罢工，已进入第四日，但“仍看不到解决的途径”。虽然部分米店现已重开，但卖得很少。因为买者不愿意或者是不能付出每石二十八万蒋币之高价。
    【新华社陕北十五日电】蒋管区物价暴涨已引起各大学相继罢教罢课。据中央社称：南京中央大学继教授会联同请愿后，各系科学生又召开代表大会，要求增加副食费，并于十二日起实行罢课，向行政院及教育部请愿。中央社又称：沈阳东北大学教授曾以物价高涨，无法维持生活，当局又无法调整，于十三日起罢教三日，以示抗议。
    【新华社陕北十四日电】据中央社称：南京中央大学教授以生活困苦无法维持，于十二日假该校招待中外记者，会上由该校教授会常务理事郑集、刘广云、江良规、吴世昌等教授先后发言称：中大教授抗战八年之中，始终坚守岗位，吃尽艰苦，一无怨言。现胜利迄今将两年，教育尚未得应有之重视，教育经费仅有国家总支出百分之三·七。中大复员时申请美汇二万元，购备图书仪器，迄无具体结果。致实习工厂中烟囱无烟冒出，机轮亦未曾转动，农场中仅有骨瘦如柴之荷兰牛与饥饿搏斗。就工作条件言，几无法展开；就生活条件言，更为可怜。斗室一间，住宿饮食会客皆在此，子女众多者则更感窄隘。以比之中纺、招商、四行（按均系四大家族所霸占之私产）之职员，其生活水准之悬殊，实不可同日而语。又据称：该校教授并曾两度派人向新任蒋记行政院长张群请愿，要求改善生活，但毫无结果。
    【新华社陕北十四日电】据中央社消息：在沪杭一日抢米罢工风潮中，浙江金华英士大学学生为“迁校”问题又发生学潮。（蒋家当局无理的要该校迁移，学生们不愿意。）五百余学生拟自杭乘车赴京请愿未果，当将车站占据，沪杭交通为之断绝。九日晨学生将行李装在二辆铁甲车箱上，轮流推动，全体徒步沿沪杭路前进。铁路局乃将长安站至笕桥站间铁路一段拆除。一时情势严重，蒋记教育部忙派次长杭立武飞杭，以解散学校威胁学生，惟至十二日学生仍留杭坚持中。
