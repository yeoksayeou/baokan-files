　　[This Dispatch from Taiyue, 28th] A unit of the Jinan People's Liberation Army recently held a ceremony in a forward area to bid farewell to over a thousand Shimin (urban residents) who had participated in the war effort and were returning to their hometowns in triumph. First, a representative of the × Brigade expressed gratitude to the Shimin Support-the-Front Team and praised their outstanding work during the Jinan Campaign. Then, Wang Wenxiu, a model war participant and meritorious worker, expressed thanks for the care and love shown by the troops, saying that upon returning home, they would surely tell future war participants to do an even better job. He also said: "This time, we participated in the war and personally witnessed the 'two hardships.' First, the people in the newly liberated areas are too poor, and we, the people in the old liberated areas, must help them well so that they can also stand up like us. Second, the troops fight too hard. Thinking of this, our past work of giving preferential treatment to military families was not good enough. From now on, we must do this work well and not be as 'three plows and two harrows' (meaning rough and careless) as in the past, so that the army can fight at the front with peace of mind." During the speech, slogans rose and fell, filled with the brotherly affection between the people's army and the emancipated masses. After the meeting, the participating masses lined up to depart, and representatives and leaders of the troops gathered at the village entrance to pour wine and shake hands with each participating mass. The team, carrying the red flag presented by the troops with the words "Meritorious Deeds Shine in Jinan, Return in Triumph," beamed with smiles, each carrying a bundle of spoils of victory, passing through the dense crowd. The villagers watched them with astonished eyes. Old man Zhang Minggao watched and said to his wife beside him, "Look, the army and the people are so good." His wife nodded with a smile. Two other old men were also discussing nearby. Zhang Xijiang said, "This shows that the Eighth Route Army is different from the Chiang-Yan army." Li Jiangtai nodded in response, "That's right," and then smiled confidently, "It will be like this here too, and we will be like this with the Eighth Route Army in the future!"

　　晋南人民解放军欢送士敏参战队
    【本报太岳二十八日电】晋南人民解放军某部日前在前线某地欢送士敏千余参战群众凯旋还乡。首由×旅代表向士敏参战队表示感谢，并盛赞在晋南战役中士敏参战群众的出色工作。继由参战模范功臣王文秀对部队对他们的关心与爱护表示谢意，并说回去后，一定要告诉以后参战的群众，让他们把工作作得更好。他又说：“我们这次参战，亲眼看到了“两苦”，一是新解放区老百姓太苦，我们老解放区老百姓一定要好好帮助他们，让他们也像我们一样翻过身来；一是部队作战太辛苦，从这想起我们过去的优待军属实在作得不够好，从今以后我们一定要把这工作作好，不再像过去那样“三犁两耙”（即粗率的意思），好使军队在前线安心打仗”。讲话中，口号声彼落此起，充满了人民军队和翻身群众亲如兄弟的情谊。会毕，参战群众整队出发，部队代表和首长齐集村口为每一参战群众斟酒握别。参战队打着部队赠的“功昭晋南、奏凯而归”的红旗，笑容满面，每个人都担着一捆胜利品，从密集的人群中穿过。村里的老百姓带着惊异的眼光目送他们。老汉张明高一面看，一面向身边的老婆说：“你看军队和老百姓就是好”，老婆含笑点着头。另外两个老汉也在旁边议论，张习江说：“这就看出八路军和蒋阎军不一样”，李江太点头回答说：“对”，然后又微笑自信地说：“咱们这里也会这样的，以后咱们和八路军也会是这样的！”
