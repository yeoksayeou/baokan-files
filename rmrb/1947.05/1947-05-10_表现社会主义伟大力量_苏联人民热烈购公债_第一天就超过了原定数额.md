　　Demonstrating the Great Strength of Socialism
    Soviet People Enthusiastically Purchase Government Bonds
    First Day Exceeds Original Quota
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th] Moscow Dispatch: To comply with the Five-Year Plan for restoring and developing the national economy, increasing the accumulation of people's wealth, and promoting economic and cultural construction, the Soviet Council of Ministers decided: (1) To issue the Second National Economic Restoration and Development Bond, totaling 200 billion rubles for a term of 20 years. (2) The bond tickets and their income—including bonuses—are exempt from national and local taxes. (3) To approve the Second Bond Issuance Regulations proposed by the Ministry of Finance.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th] Comprehensive Report: The Soviet government's Second National Economic Restoration and Development Bond of 200 billion rubles was sold out in 24 hours from the night of the 4th to the evening of the 5th, and exceeded 258 million rubles. Purchases are continuing. The Soviet people have once again demonstrated their great strength and infinite loyalty to a more prosperous and consolidated socialist motherland. When the radio broadcast the issuance of the bonds on the night of the 4th, a wave of enthusiastic bond purchases immediately swept across the Soviet Union, from factories to collective farms, from the mainland to the sea, from Moscow to the remote Arctic, from offices to border outposts and overseas garrison barracks. Many workers, farmers, fishermen, officers and soldiers of the army and navy, civil servants, and intellectuals lent their four to six weeks, or even two to three months, of salary or income to the state. Moscow residents subscribed to nearly 120,000 rubles, and Leningrad subscribed to more than 600 million.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th] Moscow Dispatch: The Pravda newspaper recently published an editorial commenting on the brisk sales of the new Soviet bonds. It stated: The great success of the new bonds once again proves the spiritual and political unity of the Soviet people, and the strong patriotic consciousness and organization. The following facts demonstrate the universal support of the people for the new bonds: in 1945, 83 percent of the bonds were sold on the first day, in 1946, 94 percent of the bonds were sold on the first day, and this year, 101.3 percent was reached on the first day. This is a victory for the issuance of Soviet bonds, and no other country has ever achieved such success. Now, the working people are continuing to purchase bonds in an atmosphere of great political action.
