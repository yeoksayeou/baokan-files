　　Rather Be a Broken Jade Than an Unfired Tile
    Comrade Wang Shijun Dies Heroically
    Dongyuan County Committee Issues Commendation

    [Our Ji-Lu-Yu Office, 10th dispatch] The Dongyuan County Committee issued a commendation for Comrade Wang Shijun, who heroically sacrificed himself while persisting in the struggle behind enemy lines, and called on all party members and cadres in the county to avenge the deceased. Comrade Wang Shijun was a glorious member of the Chinese Communist Party. He was consistently a model worker, and in the self-defense war, he was elected as the top hero of Dongyuan County. Since the first offensive by Chiang's army in August of last year, Comrade Wang volunteered to join the armed work team, lurking among the masses to monitor bad elements, strike at the enemy's henchmen, and understand the enemy's situation. When Chiang's army's 41st Division entered Dongyuan County in August of last year, he led more than ten members of the armed work team to block two regiments of the enemy. From Kaocheng to Dongming City, a distance of eighty li, they fought the enemy for three days before they reached Dongming City, which greatly helped the work of the entire county. During the second offensive by the enemy, he again stayed in the heart of the central area to carry out the work of eliminating traitors. Even under the situation where the enemy was present in every village, he removed two great scourges for the people, a puppet village chief and a platoon leader. Although the environment in Dongyuan County was tense, he always persisted in the struggle in the heartland. In January of this year, he and armed work team member Chen Dayou were active together. One day, they stayed in Xihangang Village in the sixth district. They were discovered by the enemy, and more than 80 soldiers of the puppet third district's Zhao Yuzhong's detachment went to capture them. They surrounded the house where they were staying. The two men hid under a millstone in a small mill house. After the enemy surrounded the house, they searched everywhere inside and outside the courtyard. When they walked to the door of the mill house, they saw the two men and shouted to Comrade Wang Shijun: "Surrender your guns, you two are finished." Comrades Wang and Chen ignored the enemy. The enemy shouted again: "You are finished, surrender your guns!" The enemy shouted several times. Comrade Wang Shijun picked up a wooden stick and threw it out, shouting loudly: "Here, take it!" Suddenly, more than ten enemies ran to the stick to snatch it. At this time, Comrade Wang Shijun fired three boxes of bullets, wounding two enemies, causing many enemies to suddenly scatter to the base of the walls. No enemy dared to move forward, but only fired into the mill, Wang Shijun shouted, "Whoever comes will be killed." The enemy dug many holes around the house, burning it with firewood and shooting at it with guns. From breakfast time to morning, Comrade Wang Shijun used up all the bullets from his rifle, leaving only seven pistol bullets and a hand grenade. The house was on fire. Comrade Wang Shijun took off his coat, put it in the fire, broke the rifle and burned it in the fire. He first threw a hand grenade out the door, driving away the enemies in front of the mill house. He then rushed out through the smoke and fire, about fifty paces away from the enemy. The enemy's bullets hit his leg, and he fell. At this time, the enemy advanced to capture him. As the enemy approached him, he fired the seven bullets, killing one enemy. Comrade Wang also gloriously sacrificed himself.

　　身陷重围宁为玉碎
    王世俊同志壮烈牺牲
    东垣县委会通令褒扬
    【本报冀鲁豫十日电】东垣县委会通令褒扬坚持敌后斗争英勇牺牲的王世俊同志，并号召全县党员干部为死者复仇。王世俊同志是光荣的中国共产党党员，他一贯是工作模范，在自卫战争中，又当选为东垣县的头等英雄。王同志自去年八月蒋军第一次进攻时，自报奋勇参加武工队，潜伏于群众中监视坏分子，打击敌人爪牙并了解敌情。去年八月蒋军四一师进到东垣县境后，他率十余个武工队员阻击敌人二个团，从考城到东明城八十里，他们打的敌人三天才到东明城，给了全县工作很大帮助。敌人第二次进攻时，又是他留在中心区腹地作锄奸工作，他就在敌人各村皆到的形势下，给人民除了两个大害，一个伪乡长和一个排长。东垣县环境虽然紧张，但是他却永远在腹地坚持斗争。今年一月里，他和武工队员陈大友二人在一起活动，一天，住到六区西郝岗村，被敌发觉，伪三区赵玉忠中队八十余人去捉他二人，把他住的宅子团团包围，他二人隐蔽在一个小磨屋的磨盘底下，敌人包围房子后，即在院屋内各处搜索；走到磨屋门前时即瞧着他二人了，就对王世俊同志喊道：“缴枪吧，你们二人不中了。”王、陈二同志未理敌人，敌人又喊道：“不中了缴枪吧！”敌人连喊几次，王世俊同志拾起一个木棒往外一投，大声喊道：“给你们吧！”忽有十余个敌人跑到棒前乱夺；这时候王世俊同志打了三匣子枪，击伤敌人二名，使很多敌人忽然闪开到各墙根底下去了，再没有一个敌人敢向前进，只是用枪往里打，王世俊喊“谁来打死谁”。敌人在房子周围挖了好多窟窿，一面用柴烧，一面用枪打，从早饭时打到上午，王世俊同志把大枪子弹也打完了，只剩七粒匣子枪子弹和一颗手榴弹。房子被烧着了，王同志把大衣脱下，放在火里，把大枪折断放在火里烧着了，他首先向门外打了一个手榴弹，把磨屋门前的敌人打跑了，他便顺着烟火往外冲，距敌人有五十余步，敌人的枪打住他一只腿，他跌倒了。这时敌人前进捉他，当敌人走近他时，他把七粒子弹打了出去，打死敌人一个，王同志也光荣的牺牲了。
