Xinhua News Agency, Northern Henan Front, 1st: The captured generals of the Second Rapid Column arrived in Yigou on April 24th, ten days later than the time Jiang Jieshi designated for them to occupy Yigou. They arrived here as prisoners. When the senior commander of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army who commanded these battles met them, the Deputy Commander Major General Jiang Tiexiong, Yuan Zhishan, and others were full of shame. Jiang Tiexiong said when introducing himself: My hometown is in Jiangsu, I graduated from the sixth class of Whampoa Military Academy, studied engineering in Germany, and served as a regimental commander in Hu Zongnan's army. He said with extreme remorse: "It's really a headache to talk about it." Yuan Zhishan held out the five fingers of his left hand and said: "I, this deputy brigade commander, officially reported for duty from Qi County, and was captured only five days later." When Jiang Tiexiong talked about his past sinful life, he said: "It's a headache, what have I been doing for so many years? Thinking about it, I'm really doing evil." A chief of staff of the People's Liberation Army asked whether their operations this time were based on the new principle of "camping should be concentrated rather than dispersed." Jiang Tiexiong said: "Large troops living in one village is generally not done, because they are afraid of attacks by the Eighth Route Army." The chief of staff asked again: "When you were surrounded in Daxiaohuying, what was your estimate of the People's Liberation Army?" Jiang Tiexiong said: "We estimated that you didn't have many cannons. Judging from the gunfire, your main force would not arrive until dawn." The chief of staff asked again: "What operational arrangements did Li Shouzheng have? Did he have the confidence to hold on?" Yuan Zhishan replied: "There were no arrangements. The brigade commander was just sitting in the house at the time. He had the confidence to hold on until the next day." The chief of staff asked: "So, in your opinion, what is the main reason for this defeat?" Jiang Tiexiong said: "The morale of the two sides is too different. Your movements are too fast and your command is flexible. We had just camped when you arrived." Yuan Zhishan continued: "Both sides say they are for the people. This side (referring to the liberated areas) really gives the people benefits, while that side (referring to Jiang Jieshi) just talks about it. In reality, the people are living in misery and cannot survive. People are thinking of change. Who will win and who will lose has already been determined."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Henan Front, 29th: Li Shouzheng, the Major General Brigade Commander of the 49th Brigade (Second Rapid Column) of the Jiang Army, who laid down his weapons in the Qi County area, and Deputy Brigade Commanders Jiang Tiexiong and Yuan Zhishan, acting Regimental Commander Wang Jibin, etc., have now arrived in the rear of the People's Liberation Army. Li Shouzheng and Jiang Tiexiong were both slightly injured in the battle. After careful treatment by the medical personnel of the People's Liberation Army, they will soon recover. Li Shouzheng was wearing an ill-fitting dark blue old cotton military uniform that had been temporarily exchanged for him. His face was sallow and he looked extremely tired. According to the soldiers escorting them, Li Shouzheng was commanding the battle from a tall building in the Dahu Camp battle. The tall building was destroyed by our fierce artillery fire, and Li Shouzheng fell to the ground along with the collapsed walls. Fortunately, he was immediately rescued by the People's Liberation Army soldiers, otherwise he would have been more seriously injured. Li Shouzheng is from Xinning, Hunan, is 43 years old, a student of the fourth class of Whampoa Military Academy, and has served as a regimental commander, brigade commander, division commander, and other positions. He and his deputy brigade commanders, regimental commanders, and battalion commanders were greatly moved by the hospitality and comfort they received from the People's Liberation Army along the way. Li repeatedly stated that he himself was unwilling to fight in the civil war and embark on the civil war, but he was forced by orders from superiors and had no other choice. He complained that Wang Zhonglian's command was wrong and the intelligence was inaccurate, which led to the rapid annihilation of their Second Rapid Column. He said: "It's good that I came to the liberated area this time, I can take this opportunity to study."

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 29th: Major General Zhang Xuetang, Deputy Commander of the 89th Division of the Jiang Army, who laid down his weapons in the Liunan Campaign, is recently living a happy study life in a certain place in Liaodong. When he learned that his original unit, the Second Rapid Column (i.e., the 49th Brigade), had 5,000 officers and soldiers liberated in the Northern Henan Campaign, he was very pleased. He entrusted this agency to send a telegram to the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region to be forwarded to the liberated Column Commander Li Shouzheng, etc., of the Second Rapid Column. The original telegram is as follows:

General Liu Bocheng, please forward to Brigade Commander Li Shouzheng: I recently heard that your brigade has been liberated. This is truly the supreme good fortune for the officers and soldiers who have shared hardships with me for a long time! I also had the honor of being liberated with the 89th Division at the beginning of the month. From now on, I can only recognize the correct path of the revolution and vow not to be a sacrifice for Jiang Jieshi's personal gain again. This is a self-exhortation and a mutual encouragement for the officers and soldiers of your brigade. Zhang Xuetang, printed, April 21st.

Deputy Division Commander Zhang also asked General Liu Bocheng to help him find out whether Wang Zhiying, the regimental commander of the 126th Regiment of his original 49th Division, was also liberated in this battle. Note: Major General Zhang Xuetang was originally the Deputy Commander of the 49th Division. After the division was reorganized into the 49th Brigade, Deputy Commander Zhang was transferred to his current position.

　　第二快纵被俘将领到达宜沟
    蒋铁雄懊丧谈被歼原因
    李守正抱怨王仲廉指挥无能
    【新华社豫北前线一日电】第二快速纵队的被俘将领，在四月二十四日到达宜沟，距蒋介石指定他们占领宜沟的时间晚了十天，他们是以俘虏的资格到这里来的。指挥这些战斗的解放军某部高级指挥员接见他们时，少将副指挥官蒋铁雄、袁峙山等满面羞惭。蒋铁雄自我介绍时说：老家在江苏，黄埔六期毕业，到德国学过工兵，曾任胡宗南军的团长。他极度懊丧的说：“说起来真伤脑筋。”袁峙山伸出左手的五个指头说：“我这个副旅长从淇县出发正式到职，到被俘才五天。”蒋铁雄谈到过去的罪恶生活时说：“伤脑筋，干了这样多年究竟干了个啥？想起来实在是在造孽。”解放军某参谋长问及他们此次作战是否根据“宿营宜聚不宜散”的新原则，蒋铁雄说：“很大的部队住一个村，一般是不这样做的，这样作是怕八路军袭击。”参谋长又问：“你们在大小胡营被包围时，对解放军作何估计？”蒋铁雄说：“估计你们的炮不多，从枪声判断，你们的主力还要在天明后才能赶到。”参谋长又问：“李守正有什么作战布置吗？有信心坚持吗？”袁峙山答：“没有什么布置。旅长当时只是坐在屋里。坚持到第二天的信心是有的。”参谋长问：“那么这次战败，据你看来主要的原因在那里呢？”蒋铁雄说：“两边的士气相差太远。你们的动作太快，指挥灵活，我们刚宿营，你们就来了。”袁峙山接着说：“两边都说是为了老百姓，这边（指解放区）真正给人民利益，那边（指蒋介石）只是说说，实际上是民不聊生，大家活不下去，人心思变。谁胜谁败实在已经确定了。”
    【新华社豫北前线二十九日电】在淇县地区放下武器之蒋军四十九旅（第二快速纵队）少将旅长李守正，及副旅长蒋铁雄、袁峙山、代理团长王吉彬等，现已到达人民解放军后方。李守正及蒋铁雄在战斗中均负轻伤，经人民解放军的医务人员细心治疗，不久当可告愈。李守正身着临时掉换极不合体的深蓝色旧棉军服，面色枯黄，状极疲惫。据护送彼等之战士称：在大胡营战斗中，李守正在一座高楼上指挥作战，高楼为我猛烈炮火轰坍，李守正随着倒坍的墙壁一齐落到楼下。幸为解放军战士立即救起，否则将受伤更重。李守正为湖南新宁人，现年四十三岁，黄埔四期学生，历任团长、旅长、师长等职。他和他的副旅长、团长、营长们沿路受到解放军招待安慰，极为感动。李氏一再表示他自己并不愿意打内战，走上内战场，但上级命令逼迫，实在没有办法了，他抱怨王仲廉指挥错误，情报不灵，使他们第二快速纵队很快的就被歼灭了。他说：“我这次来到解放区也好，借此机会学习学习”。
    【新华社东北二十九日电】柳南战役放下武器之蒋军八十九师副师长张学堂少将，近在辽东某地过着愉快的学习生活。当他闻悉其原部第二快速纵队（即四十九旅）在豫北战役中五千官兵获得解放之消息，甚感快慰。顷托本社致电晋冀鲁豫军区转被解放之第二快速纵队纵队长李守正等，原电如下：
    刘伯承将军请转李旅长守正兄：近闻贵旅已被解放，此实为吾长久共患难之官兵无上幸运！弟随八十九师亦于月初得蒙解放，今后惟有认清革命正道，誓不再作蒋介石个人之牺牲品，此实自勉而与贵旅官兵共勉者也。弟张学堂印，四月二十一日。
    张副师长并请刘伯承将军代为查寻其原四十九师老部下一二六团团长王志英是否亦于此次战役同被解放。按：张学堂少将原为四十九师副师长，该师整编为四十九旅后，张副师长被调任现职。
