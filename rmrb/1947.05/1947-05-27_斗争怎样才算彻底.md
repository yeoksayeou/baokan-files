　　“How is Struggle Considered Thorough?”
　　Wang Chun
　　Comrade Li Zhengyun forwarded a bunch of questions, all raised by young comrades during their studies: How is struggle considered thorough?
　　In some places, after the struggle, nothing was left for the landlords. Is that right?
　　Comrade Zhang Qiming of the Fifth Administrative Office of Lin County raised the following question:
　　There is a landlord who is an old woman. After the struggle, she has a hard time making a living. Should we take care of her?
　　There are many other similar questions, which we will not list one by one.
　　Regarding these questions, our opinion is this: How is struggle considered thorough? This should be viewed from both political and economic perspectives: Politically, landlords must no longer be able to dominate the government; it must be clear to everyone in society that people who rely on feudal exploitation and oppression to eat are not "superior people," nor are they "upper class," and they are definitely not glorious figures, but parasites who should be looked down upon. Like in the past, when poor people opened their mouths in the public office, or were pressed into the public office by landlords and forced to kowtow, they would be scolded by the landlords, asking, "How much land do you cultivate?" – such a situation must be struggled against so that it can never happen again; like in the past, when landlords came out, everyone made way, and when the landlord's daughter got married, everyone carried the sedan chair – such a situation must also be struggled against so that it can never return. Struggle until the landlords are equal to us, struggle until the landlords have to go to the latrine to defecate, instead of using a chamber pot on the peasant's kang. To such an extent, the political struggle is considered thorough. But the landlord's power in politics comes from his economic monopoly of land. Didn't he scold you as soon as you opened your mouth, "How much land do you cultivate?" Therefore, the thorough struggle in the economic aspect is even more important. The thorough standard in this regard should be this: Struggle until the landlords return all the land they illegally plundered and occupied to the peasants; struggle until the landlords return all the things they exploited and extorted to the peasants; struggle until their economic situation today is the same as ours, having to earn a living through labor, and even if we pick up manure and eat chaff, they cannot sit and eat noodles; even if we carry burdens and sell casseroles, they must carry something to take care of their mouths, because it must be done this way to be in accordance with justice. Otherwise, if the exploiters are still living comfortably, and the exploited are still living in hardship, what kind of thoroughness is this? We feel that the question of "how is struggle considered thorough" can only be answered in this way. Achieving this is generally considered thorough.
　　However, I know that this will not satisfy the comrades who raised the questions. Because these comrades will say this: Today is no longer the time for landlords to talk about equality with peasants in politics, but the time when peasants do not talk about equality with landlords; it is no longer the time for landlords to be concerned about whether their food and clothing are comfortable, but the time when landlords have a difficult life. As in the questions mentioned earlier, asking "Is it right that some places did not leave anything for the landlords?" asking "Should we take care of the widow landlord?" – all reveal this kind of thinking. Regarding this kind of thinking, I will start by saying this: There was a foreigner who said such a sentence: "If you want to judge whether a person is a good person, never look at him when he is out of power, but look at him when he is in power. Otherwise, please hand over the power to him and try it." As for the landlord, we have already learned enough about his behavior when he was in power, and we never want to try it again. Now they are indeed a little out of power. But is this why we should take care of them? Is this why we should leave them more of the things they exploited from other people's families, so that people don't have to ask for them back during this time of liberation? "He has nothing," "He has a hard time making a living," these may be facts, and it seems like we should sympathize; but what is considered his things? He has lived comfortably off other people's things for many years, and now, according to their own often-said law, "pay back debts," what is there to ask about whether it is right or wrong? He returns other people's things to them, and he ends up with a little "difficulty," what is so rare about this? I think they have always explained this point more clearly than anyone else. Otherwise, please recall the state of the world when they were in power, and you will not have such doubts. Moreover, the problem is not even here. If you go to persuade the peasants to sympathize with the landlord's "having nothing," if you go to advocate taking care of the landlord's "difficult life," this is called walking the road of "handing over the power to him again!" But don't look at him crying poor, pretending to be foolish, and faking kindness now, this is only because he is currently out of power; once he regains power, see if he still sympathizes with the peasants? See if he still takes care of the masses? I think everyone can determine that the common people will definitely not survive! This is not only proven by the landlord's prestige when he was in power for thousands of generations, but also by the "counter-settlement movement" wherever Chiang's troops go, which is now on display for everyone to see! Therefore, I feel that the key point of the problem is still here: Instead of telling the masses today to take care of the landlords, it is better to warn the peasants to be careful and prevent them from regaining power! Therefore, I feel that we still need to thoroughly investigate and be careful. The question of whether to take care of them or not is really not an important matter. Moreover, there is another saying that they are still greatly questionable as to how "pitiful" they are now. In my hometown, a landlord's family was overthrown by his relatives and friends; why? Because during the famine years, he pretended to eat grass roots like everyone else and refused to lend his sister a liter of grain, saying that he was "really finished"; but this time, he dug out eighty stones of wheat that had all gone moldy. Therefore, his sisters hated him and overthrew him. A comrade who works with us, his family also declared that they were completely impoverished a long time ago, but this time they also dug out sixty stones of wheat that had rotted into manure. This shows that believing too early that the landlords' lives have "no way out," and wanting to give the masses advice to "take care of" them too early, will only hit the masses' hard nail and fall for the landlords' big trap. Because the peasants are much clearer and more aware of the landlords' cunning than we are.
　　Speaking of this, I really want to give a little advice to the comrades who raised these questions. Our movement is called "Thorough Liberation." The phrasing of these comrades is called "How is struggle considered thorough?" Can everyone see that the class positions expressed in these two sentences are exactly opposite! One is standing on the side of the peasants, paying attention to how to thoroughly liberate the masses; the other is standing on the side of the landlords, concerned about "What kind of state do you have to struggle the landlords to for it to be considered thorough?" Why does such an opposite phrasing appear in the same movement? Let me give an example first:
　　In the past, we had a comrade here who worked with us for five or six years and studied rectification together for more than a year. He worked hard, was responsible, and diligently studied documents. But he always raised this question: You all say that the base area society is constantly progressing, why do I see many things as nonsense? You all say that you are developing, why do I feel that I am degenerating? Later, he figured it out. He said: It turns out that this is the case: My family and my class are connected, that is to say, my relatives and friends all belong to the landlord class; because that class is going downhill, so I look at society through my family and my class, and I can't see any happy events, I only see my relatives, friends, and my father all having bad luck, how can I see any prosperity and upward progress? Similarly, I only see the masses showing off everywhere, ruining the "usually stable social order," how can I see any progress in work? And seeing bad luck and nonsense, how can I not degenerate? How can I feel that I have any personal development? Finally, he said that this is because I am standing on the position of the landlord class, so all my views and ideas are the opposite of everyone else.
　　I feel that the comrades who are raising these questions now, naturally write "Thorough Liberation" as "How is struggle considered thorough?" and there is not much difference from the position that the above-mentioned comrade stood on! But if a person is standing on that position, then it is impossible to reach an agreement with our opinions on the issue of the mass movement! Therefore, our answer will not satisfy these comrades in any way. Our opinion is this: Change our position. Change from sympathizing with the landlords to sympathizing with the peasants. Change from questioning "How is struggle considered thorough?" to "How can we thoroughly liberate the masses?" With this change, not only will we see the problem more closely to the truth, but it will also be good for ourselves: because we, as the youth of the new society, cannot be slaves of the old family; we must be the masters of the new era, not the dregs of the old society. We see that the exploiting class is about to go bankrupt, and of course we should not rush to find it to subscribe for shares, to share its bad luck, and to mourn for it.

### “斗争怎样才算彻底”

　　“斗争怎样才算彻底”
    王春
    李正云同志转来了一束问题，都是一些青年同志在学习中间提出来的：斗争怎样才算彻底？
    有的地方斗争过后，没有给地主留东西，对不对？
    林县第五专署张启铭同志，则提出下边这个问题：
    有个地主是个老太婆，斗争过后，她很难生活，我们是否应该照顾她？
    此外类似的问题还多，我们不再一一列举。
    关于这些问题，我们的意见是这样：斗争怎样才算彻底呢？这要从政治和经济两方面来看：必须做到在政治上地主再不能独霸政权；必须让全社会的人都明白，靠封建剥削压迫别人吃饭的人们，并不是“人上人”，也不是“上等人”，而且根本就不是什么光荣的人物，是应该遭人看不起的寄生虫。像过去穷人才到公所张了口，或是被地主押进公所扣着头，就被地主喝骂一番，问“你可种得有几个二厘五毫”——像这种情形，斗到它再不能够出现了；像过去地主老爷出来大家都让路，地主的闺女出嫁大家都抬轿——像这种情形，也斗得它再也不能复转了；斗到地主和我们平等，斗到地主拉屎也得到茅坑，而不是就在农民炕上使尿桶。斗到这样程度，就算政治方面的斗争彻底了。但是地主在政治上的厉害，还是从他在经济上的霸占着土地而来的，你不听他开口就骂你“可种的有二厘五毫”吗？所以经济方面的彻底斗争，更是主要的。这方面的彻底标准，应该是这样：斗到地主把非法盘剥霸占来的土地一齐退给农民；斗到地主把剥削讹诈来的东西也一齐退给农民，斗到他今天在经济上的情况也和我们一样得劳动谋生，我们拾粪吃糠，他也不能坐着吃面；我们挑担卖沙锅，他也须得担挑点什么顾他的嘴，因为必须作到这样，才合乎公理。否则剥削人的人还过的很舒服，被剥削的人还过的很紧迫，这还叫做什么彻底？我们觉着“怎样才算斗争彻底”这个问题，就只能是这样答复。做到这样，大体上就算彻底。
    不过，我知道这样说，并不能满足提问题的同志们的意思。因为，这些同志会这么讲：今天已经不是要地主在政治上和农民讲平等的时候了，而是农民不跟地主讲平等的时候了；也不是地主讲究吃穿得舒服不舒服的时候了，而是地主生活艰难的时候了。像前面所举问题中，问“有的地方没有给地主留下东西对不对？”问“寡妇地主是否要照顾一下？”就都是这种思想的透露。对于这种思想，我是这么着手讲：有个外国人，讲过这么一句话：“你要想判断一个人是不是好人，千万不要在他失势的时候来看，要在他得志的时候来看。否则就请你把权力交给他试一试。”对于地主，当他在得志时候的行为，我们是早已领教够的了，试是再也不想去试一回的了。现在他们的确有点失势。但是这是不是就该着照顾呢？是不是就该着把他剥削来的人家的那些东西，还给他多多留些，叫人家在这样翻身时期还不用要呢？“他没了东西”、“他很难生活”，这也许是事实，也像是很该同情；但是那一件算是他的东西？他拿人家的东西舒服了好多年，现在照他们自己常讲的法律，“欠债还钱”，这还要问什么对不对呢？他把人家的东西交还给人家，自己落得有点“困难”了，这还有什么稀罕呢？我想这点道理，他们是早就讲得比谁都清楚的了，否则请你回忆一下当他们得志着那时候的世道，就会不生这种疑问。而且问题还并不在此，你去劝说农民同情地主的“没有东西”吧，就去提倡照顾地主的“生活困难”吧，这就叫做走向“把权力再交给他”的道路！可是你不要看他现在哭穷装蒜假善良，这只是因为他正在失势；等他一旦再得了志，看他还同情不同情农民？看他还照顾不照顾群众？我想每一个人都可断定，一定是小百姓没有活的！这不只有千年百代得志时候的地主的威风可以证明，就是蒋军所到之处的“倒算运动”也现在摆着叫大家去看！所以我觉着问题的要点倒还在这里：与其今天来向群众说什么照顾地主，还不如警告农民小心防备他重新得志！因此我觉着还得彻底的清查，好好的留神。照顾与否的问题，实在还不是紧要的事情。况且还有一说，他们现在到底“可怜”到什么程度，这就还是个大大的疑问。我的家乡，有一家地主被他的故亲厚友斗翻了，群众并未动手；为什么？因为灾荒年间，他和大家装着一样吃草根，不肯借给他姊姊一升谷，说是“确实完了”；可是这回却刨出他八十石麦子都霉烂了。因此他姊姊们恨极了打倒了他。我们在一起工作的一个同志，他的家庭也早就声明穷透了，可是这回也刨出六十石麦子烂成粪了。这就可以说明，过早的相信地主们的生活已经“没了办法”，过早的想给群众提意见“照顾”他们，只有碰群众的响钉子，上地主的大大当。因为对于地主的狡猾，农民是比我们清楚得多而且多的。
    说到这里，我倒是真想给提这些问题的同志们进一点意见。我们的运动，叫做“彻底翻身”。这些同志们的提法，却叫做“斗争怎样才算彻底？”大家是不是看出了这两句话中间所表现的阶级立场正正相反！一个是站在农民这方面说，注意的是怎样才能叫群众彻底翻身；一个是站在地主那方面说，关心的是“你要把地主斗到什么样子才算彻底”。为什么同一运动，却会出现这样恰相反对的提法呢？我先来讲个例子看：
    从前我们这里有一位同志，和我们一道工作过五六年，一起整风学习过一年多。他是努力工作的，艰苦负责、认真学习的钻研文件。但是他一直提着这么个问题：你们都说根据地社会不断在进步，为什么我却看着许多事情像是在胡闹呢？你们都说自己在发展，为什么我却觉着自己在消沉呢？后来他想通了。说：原来是这么回事：我的家庭和我的阶级连系，就是说我的那些亲戚朋友，都是属于地主那一层的；因为那个阶层在走下坡路，所以我通过我的家庭，我的阶层来看社会，就看不见一点喜幸事，我只看见我的亲戚朋友以及父亲他们都在走倒运，更那里能看到什么繁荣向上的进步现象？同样，我只看到群众在到处逞威风，把从来“平平稳稳的社会秩序”胡闹坏了，更那里看到什么工作进步？而眼看的是倒运、是胡闹，那我又那里能不消沉？那里能感觉到个人有什么发展呢？最后他说，这就是因为我站的是地主阶级的立场，所以我的一切看法想法都和大家相反。
    我觉着现在提这些问题的同志们，把“彻底翻身”，自然而然的就写成了“斗争怎样才算彻底？”是和上述那个同志所站的立场没大差别的！可是一个人要是站在那个立场上，那就对于群众运动的问题，是无论如何也难以和我们的意见取得一致的！因此我们的答复，也无论如何难以使这些同志满意。我们的意见是这样：把我们的立场换一换。从同情地主那一面换到同情农民这一面来。从追问“斗争怎样才算彻底？”换到“怎样才能叫群众彻底翻身”这一面来。这么换了，不但对看问题会看得更接近真实一些，而且对自己也有好处：因为我们做新社会的青年，不能去做旧家庭的奴隶；我们要作新时代的主人，不能去做旧社会的渣滓。我们眼看着剥削人的阶级快要倒账了，我们当然不应该抢着找它去认股，去替它分担霉气，去替它哭丧。
