　　Experience in Combining Wartime Service with Sowing and Organizing Auxiliary Labor
    Taihang Second Special District Office
    Currently, how to organize all labor has become an important link to ensure support for the war and the victorious completion of sowing. Based on the experiences of various regions, we introduce the following:
    I. Combining Spring Sowing with Wartime Service
    1.  Conduct vigorous ideological education on production to support the war.
    First, it is necessary to overcome the slack and 麻痹 [ma bi - numb, apathetic] thinking of the masses and cadres, take active action, and complete sowing ahead of schedule. Second, it is necessary to overcome complacency in production. This problem is prone to occur in areas with a foundation for organized production work. Third, it is necessary to overcome the pessimistic emotions of losing confidence due to a large shortage of labor. If these ideological emotions cannot be reversed, wartime service and production cannot be well combined. It is necessary to make every mass cadre clearly mobilized ideologically to strongly support the front lines in winning battles, so as to defend the land and protect the rear production. Doing a good job in production can guarantee the victory of the front lines. Make spring sowing and wartime service closely combined in thought and action; do not be proud, do not be discouraged, and do not delay either end. Some places have proposed: "If you don't sow seeds in the spring, you will starve in the fall"; "Production and prosperity will win battles, men, women, old and young will work together"; "Think of a good time; hold a gun to fight Lao Jiang in one hand, and hold a hoe to grow crops in the other," and other mobilization slogans are very good.
    2.  Unified Leadership of Sowing and Wartime Service.
    In village leadership, spring sowing and wartime service should be unified into a wartime service production command (committee). For example, Dazhai Village in Yuci County is one of the villages with the most severe labor shortage in the whole county, with an average of 43.5 mu of cultivated land per laborer. The village implemented unified leadership, with cadres dividing responsibilities and uniformly deploying civilian labor. Under the heavy burden of public service last year, spring sowing was completed ahead of schedule, and wartime service work was not affected in the slightest. On the contrary, in individual counties and villages, the leadership is not unified; the production committee leads production, and the anti-service leader leads wartime service. When spring sowing and wartime service are squeezed together, they argue with each other, which affects both spring sowing and wartime service. Therefore, all villages should be consistent in thought and organization, unified planning and arrangement, and adjust civilian labor.
    3.  Combine meticulous organization, precise calculation, and scientific use of civilian labor.
    HeShun, Xiyang and other counties organized the war participants and livestock into echelons or groups, and cadres and activists were assigned to each echelon and group, waiting for dispatch. They planned the number of mu to be sown, the manpower and animal power required, and the total time required; organized men and women to assist labor to participate in spring sowing together, so that everyone has work, no one is idle, and strive to complete spring sowing on time. When wartime service tasks come, they are dispatched in turn according to the prepared echelons or groups. People who do not participate in the war are led by the command and implement unified large-scale labor exchange; first, they cultivate the land for those who have gone to participate in the war. Propose: "Don't come back empty-handed. Take a load of manure to the field and bring back a load of firewood home." Baijiazhuang Village in Wuxiang and other villages organized people to pull plows and sow seeds at night after the work plan was set; first sow ridge land and drought land, then sow flat land and wet land, and sow along the ridges and ditches. These are all very good. In short, under the unified leadership of the command, it is necessary to meticulously organize and accurately calculate, and master the details of the land, labor, and animal power in the village, so as to scientifically organize the use of civilian labor.
    4.  Unified labor conversion and scoring, large-scale labor exchange between front and rear.
    In the combination of spring sowing and wartime service work, the main thing is to be able to achieve a large-scale labor exchange between the front and rear; so that people who participate in the war, support the work, and volunteer transportation do not worry about production at home and serve with peace of mind; people who do not participate in the war and volunteer transportation actively work at home, take comprehensive care, and do not delay the sowing of one mu of land. Yuci implemented large-scale labor exchange between the front and rear during the war, and later developed into labor exchange with neighboring villages. Mutual help overcame the difficulties of labor and animal power. The whole village democratically scored people and animals - war participants eat public food for twelve points a day, and fifteen points a day if they do not eat public food. People who do not participate in the war are scored according to their work, and unified work and service tickets are issued, the work price is set on time, and the accounts are settled on a regular basis, with long refunds and short supplements. Zuoquan, Heshun and other counties also use this method. In addition, attention should be paid to saving civilian labor in labor exchange. Xiyu, Heshun, found work for people who stopped serving in the supply station, and no one was idle. At noon, the Ding Ce Yu cooperative organized and sold labor to war participants, completing the sowing work after the war participants left the village. Achieve a win-win situation for both parties, taking into account both public and private interests. In short, in the labor exchange between the front and rear, attention should be paid to cultivating the business of those who have left to participate in the war, and it should not be delayed and should be done as soon as possible; at the same time, pay attention to the emotions of the people who stay in the village and do not participate in the war, encourage and inspire the active creativity in production, strictly equal value exchange, and reasonable and fair labor conversion and scoring, so that everyone has no complaints.
    II. How to Organize Auxiliary Labor
    1.  Pay great attention to auxiliary labor.
    In the case of labor shortage and heavy burden of service, organizing men and women to auxiliary labor to the production front is a decisive link in the victory of spring sowing. In areas where women do not traditionally participate in labor, male laborers are most likely to underestimate women's auxiliary labor. It is necessary to use facts to break these wrong views. For example, when Zhao Gang, the labor hero of Tuling, Heshun, began to organize auxiliary labor for production, the people in the village could not understand his thinking, so he transferred to his own group and mobilized women and children to drop seeds and lead livestock in the fields, saving several full laborers to do other work. This promoted the whole village to pay attention to auxiliary labor, so that the village overcame the labor difficulties and made the spring sowing work one step ahead.
    2.  How to organize auxiliary labor.
    To organize auxiliary labor to the production front, it is first necessary to solve their ideological problems and enlighten their conscious production thinking. Heshun educated women to break the parasitic thinking of relying on men to live, and enlightened women to participate in production labor, seek economic independence, and completely liberate themselves. Secondly, implement education on production and prosperity, so that women also dare to produce and get rich, and make it clear that to get rich, the whole family, men, women, old and young, must work together. When organizing old men in Longwang Village, Heshun, a respect for the elderly meeting was held, praising the production experience and technology of the elderly, calling on everyone to learn and respect the elders, and inspiring the production emotions of the elderly. In terms of organizational form, all places are mixed organizations of men, women, full, half, and auxiliary labor. The elderly and small-footed women who cannot go to the fields form another group, sharing the work of looking after children, cooking, and doing chores, so as to achieve scientific division of labor and use, make the best use of talents, and no one is idle. In doing work, it is necessary to take care of the strength of labor and the level of technology; Dazhai and other villages in Yuci let women and children drop seeds, dig corners, lead livestock, and pull rollers, and male full laborers are responsible for cultivating the land and supporting the plows. Longwang and other villages in Heshun let the old men specialize in cultivating the land, temporarily sending letters and carrying stretchers, and the women and children are responsible for carrying water, cutting grass, grinding flour, and feeding livestock at home.
    3.  Labor Conversion, Work Scoring, and Profit Sharing.
    Auxiliary labor participating in mutual aid labor must also strictly adhere to the equal value policy, reasonably score according to labor results, grasp the dead scores and live evaluations, and promote labor enthusiasm. Heshun's auxiliary labor does work, calculates work and scores according to the day, and gives convenience to participate in labor. Xishan and other villages in Yuci divide the auxiliary labor participating in labor with their families by three to seven (seven for women and three for families), which encourages the production emotions of auxiliary labor (mainly women and children).
    4.  Combining Rewards with Learning Technology.
    When using auxiliary labor, it is necessary to master the method of more rewards and less criticism. Women and children have a great sense of vanity and competitiveness, and the leadership must grasp this characteristic. Xishan in Yuci praised auxiliary labor on the group blackboard newspaper and wrote newsletters whenever there were achievements. Make every woman and child active, and do not rest at noon or rest less at noon. It is also necessary to regularly select models, give them material rewards, and set up banners. Individual villages in Wuxiang have done a better job in this regard. At the same time, in the rewards, it is necessary to call on learning to improve technology. One of the reasons why male laborers generally despise women and children is the lack of production technology and the low level of technology. The leaders of each group should always pay attention to improving their technology from labor, so that auxiliary labor can play a greater role in production.

　　战勤与播种结合及组织辅助劳力经验
    太行二专办公室
    目前如何把一切劳力组织起来，已成为保证支援战争与胜利完成播种的重要环节。综合各地经验，介绍如下：
    一、春耕播种与战勤结合
    一、进行大力生产支援战争的思想教育。
    首先要克服群众干部思想上的松懈麻痹思想，积极行动起来，提前完成下种；其次是克服生产上的自满情绪。在组织起来生产工作有基础的地区，易犯这种毛病；第三是克服因劳力大量缺乏引起失掉信心的悲观情绪。以上这些思想情绪，如果扭不过来，就不能使战勤与生产很好结合。要使每个群众干部从思想上明确动员起来，有力支援前线打胜仗，才能保卫土地，保卫后方生产；做好生产工作，就能保证前线的打胜仗。使春耕播种与战勤在思想上行动上紧密结合起来；不骄傲、不泄气，做到两头不误。有些地方提出：春天不种籽，秋后饿肚皮；生产发家打胜仗，男女老少一齐上。想过好时光；一手荷枪打老蒋，一手拿锄闹养种等动员口号就很好。
    二、播种与战勤统一领导。
    春耕播种与战勤在村领导上，要统一组织战勤生产指挥部（委员会）。如榆社大寨村是全县劳力最缺的一个村，每一个劳力平均耕地四三·五亩，村里实行了统一领导，干部分工负责，统一抽调使用民力；在去年差务繁重的情况下，做到春耕播种提前完成，战勤工作也没有受到丝毫影响。相反的在个别县个别村领导不统一；生产委员领导生产，抗勤领导战勤，在春耕与战勤挤到一起时，就相互扯皮，使春耕与战勤均受影响。因此，各村应在思想上组织上一致，统一计划安排，调整民力。
    三、细密组织，精确计算，与科学使用民力相结合。
    和顺、昔阳等县把参战人、畜组成梯队或小组，干部与积极分子分配到各梯队与小组中，待命出动。计划出播种的亩数所需人、畜力和共用时间；组织男女辅助劳力一齐参加春耕播种，做到人人有活、不闲一人，争取时间完成春耕播种。战勤任务一来，即按准备好了梯队或小组轮流出动。不参战的人，由指挥部领导，实行统一大变工；先给参战去了的人代耕。提出：出去回来不落空。去地捎担粪，回家捎担柴。武乡白家庄等村则在工作计划订定后，组织人拉犁，实行星夜下种；先种岭地夹旱地，后种平地下湿地，按梁按沟挨着种。这都是很好的。总之在指挥部的统一领导下，要细密组织与精确计算，掌握本村的土地、劳力、畜力底细，以便科学的组织使用民力。
    四、统一折工计分，前方后方大变工。
    春耕播种与战勤工作的结合上，主要的要能做到前方后方大变工；使参战支差义运的人，不顾虑家里生产，安心服役；不参战义运的人在家积极劳动，全面照顾，不耽误一亩地的播种。榆社参战中实行前后方大变工，全村大变工，后来发展到与邻村变工。相互帮助克服了劳畜力困难。全村人畜民主评分——参战人吃公家每天十二分，不吃公家每天十五分。不参战人按活评分，统一制发工差票，按时定工价，按期结账，长退短补。左权、和顺等县也都是取用这种办法的。另外在变工上需注意节约民力。和顺西峪给兵站停差人找活做，不闲一个人。午定测鱼合作社组织和昔参战人卖工，完成了该村参战人走了后的播种工作。做到双方两利，公私兼顾。总之在前后方变工上，要注意代耕好参战走了人的营生，不耽误而且要尽先做了；同时，注意留村不参战人的情绪，鼓励启发生产上的积极创造性，严格等价交换，折工计分合理公道，做到人人无怨言。
    二、如何组织辅助劳力
    一、十分重视辅助劳力。
    在劳力缺乏差务繁重的情况下，组织男女辅助劳力到生产战线上去，是决定春耕播种胜利的一环。习惯上妇女不参加劳动地区，男劳力最易小看妇女辅助劳力。要用事实去打破这类错误观点。如和顺土岭劳英赵刚开始组织辅助劳力生产时，村里人打不通思想，他就转入自己小组，动员妇女儿童到地里溜籽、牵牲口，节省出几个全劳力搞其他活。这样推动了全村重视辅助劳力，使该村克服了劳力困难，还使春耕工作赶前一步。
    二、如何组织辅助劳力。
    要把辅助劳力组织到生产战线上来。首先必须解决他们的思想问题，启发生产思想自觉。和顺教育妇女打破靠男人活的寄生思想，启发妇女参加生产劳动，求得经济独立，彻底解放自己。其次贯彻生产发家教育，使妇女们也敢于生产发财闹富，明确要发家必须全家男女老幼齐动手。和顺龙旺村在组织老汉时，召开敬老会，表扬老年人的生产经验技术，号召大家学习尊敬长者，激发老年人的生产情绪。在组织形式上，各地都是男女全半辅助劳力参杂的混合组织，不能上地的老年和小脚妇女，就另组一起，分担看小孩做饭闹杂活，做到科学分工使用，人尽其材，不闲一人。在做活上要照顾劳力强弱，技术高低；榆社大寨等村是让妇女儿童溜籽、刨地角、牵牲口、拉砘子，男全劳力负责耕地撑耧。和顺龙旺等村让老汉们专门耕地，临时送信抬担架，家里担水切草磨面喂牲口，统由妇女儿童负责。
    三、折工计工与分红。
    辅助劳力参加互助劳动，也必须严格等价政策，按劳动成绩合理评分，掌握死分活评，发扬劳动积极性。和顺对辅助劳力做活，按晌计工计分，给以参加劳动的便利。榆社西山等村对辅助劳力参加劳动，与家里采取三七分红（女七家三），鼓舞了辅助劳力（主要是妇女儿童）的生产情绪。
    四、奖励与学习技术相结合。
    使用辅助劳力，要掌握多奖励少批评的方法。妇女儿童虚荣好胜心大，领导上必须掌握这个特点。榆社西山对辅助劳力逢有成绩，就在小组黑板报上表扬，写通讯报导。使妇女儿童个个积极，晌午不歇或少歇晌。定期的选拔模范，给以实物奖励，树立旗帜也是很必要的，武乡个别村这点做的较好。同时在奖励中要号召学习提高技术。一般男劳力所以轻视妇女儿童，没生产技术与技术的低劣就是一个原因，各个小组的领导上要经常注意从劳动中提高其技术，使辅助劳力在生产上发挥更大的作用。
