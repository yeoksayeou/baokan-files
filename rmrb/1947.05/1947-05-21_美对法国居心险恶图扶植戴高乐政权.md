Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, May 19th: TASS, Paris: The "Liberation" newspaper here recently published an article by Dournau, discussing America's "aid" to many countries, particularly America's probing in France. Dournau wrote: "Currently, we can already see what the United States intends to extract from France in exchange for its economic assistance. First, control of investment, which will be implemented through private banks and nationalized institutions. Second, the establishment of Franco-American joint ventures in the technical equipment and development of French overseas territories, especially North Africa and West Africa. Third, the conclusion of agreements regarding the establishment of American 'commercial' airline landing bases in Africa." Dournau continued: "According to reliable reports, the first batch of credit loans to France will total 100 million US dollars. These loans will not be paid by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, but will be granted by American private banks to French private banks. It is worth noting that in this regard, the US State Department not only sounded out figures in the government, but also former head of government de Gaulle was asked to clearly express his position on this type of economic agreement; because Washington does not preclude the possibility of a de Gaulle government emerging." Commenting on the American conditions, Barcelo emphasized in the "Free Parisian" newspaper: "America's objective is economic as well as strategic. Regarding certain French overseas territories, it is difficult to say whether the United States is seeking bases or markets in those locations."

　　美对法国居心险恶图扶植戴高乐政权
    【新华社陕北十九日电】塔斯社巴黎讯：此间“解放”报顷发表杜尔努之论文，论述美国对许多国家之“援助”，特别是美国在法国之试探。杜尔努写道：目前我们已可看出美国对法国的经济援助打算从法国换取的是什么。第一，是控制投资，此一控制将通过私人银行与国家化的机构来实行。第二，建立法美在法国海外领土特别是北菲和西菲的技术设备及其发展之合资经营。第三，缔结有关美国“商业”航空线在菲洲着陆基地之机构的协议。杜尔努力继称：“根据可靠的报导，第一批对法国的信用贷款，全数将为十万万美元。这些贷款将不由国际建设开发银行支付，而由美国的私人银行给予法国的私人银行。值得注意的是，在这方面美国务院不仅试探了政府方面的人士，而且前政府首脑戴高乐也被要求明白表示其对此种经济协定之立场；因为华盛顿并不阻止戴高乐政府出现的可能性。”巴尔塞罗在《自由巴黎人》报上论到美国的条件时着重称：美国的目的是经济的同时又是战略的，对于某些法国的海外领土说，很难说明美国是在该地寻求基地抑或市场。
