　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, May 3rd: Moscow Radio reports: Soviet Armed Forces Minister, Army General Bulganin, issued an order to the officers and soldiers of the Soviet Army and Navy on May Day, which stated in brief:

　　The Soviet Army and Navy are conducting combat and political training, fully absorbing the experience of the Great Patriotic War, and mastering Stalin's military science to welcome May Day. The Soviet people are commemorating May Day in a high tide of labor and political enthusiasm. The nationwide socialist competition is unfolding everywhere, preparing to solemnly commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the great leader and teacher, Comrade Stalin, the people of the whole country are resolutely overcoming post-war difficulties and winning victory after victory on the front of peaceful labor. The Soviet Union's foreign policy has always been consistent, striving for the consolidation of democratic peace and the strengthening of friendly cooperation among all nations; it has won the support and endorsement of progressive forces worldwide. Our armed forces should safeguard the peaceful labor of Soviet citizens and the interests of the Soviet state. To effectively accomplish this task, the armed forces must continue to maintain their combat readiness. Soldiers and non-commissioned officers of the Army and Navy should carefully study the art of war so as to continue to be skilled combatants in the future. In the next few days, the most important stage of combat readiness – the summer training period – will begin. During this period, the Army, Navy, and Air Force must rise up to gain new achievements in military and political training, and excellently complete the tasks assigned to them. The Soviet soldiers have already set an example of heroism, combat skills, and loyalty to the motherland during the years of the Great Patriotic War; at present, in peacetime, the entire armed forces should maintain the lofty honor and dignity of Soviet soldiers as in wartime, should be models of organization and discipline, and should do their utmost to serve the motherland! To commemorate the international festival of working people, I order: Today, on May Day, in Moscow, the capital of our country, in the capitals of all the Soviet republics, and also in Kaliningrad, Lvov, Khabarovsk, Vladivostok and Lushun, and in the heroic cities of Leningrad, Stalingrad, Sevastopol and Odessa, a twenty-gun salute will be fired in each city.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, May 4th: Moscow Radio reports: On May 2nd, Pravda published an editorial, which stated in brief: The celebration of May Day once again demonstrates to the world that the entire Soviet people, like one person, support Stalin's foreign policy, which leads to a consolidated democratic peace and conforms to the fundamental interests of the working people of all countries. On May Day, our people declared to the world: they are fully prepared to continue to defend the interests of democracy; the Soviet people have a great goal – to continue the construction of communism in our country. But, as Stalin said – while we are expanding peaceful construction, we must not forget for a moment the conspiracies of the world's reactionary forces who harbor new war plans. We must remember the words of the great Lenin: After restarting peaceful labor, we must always be vigilant and pay attention to the armed forces and self-defense capabilities of our country. Just like cherishing the apples of our eyes. The Pravda editorial concluded: Cherishing the Soviet armed forces has always been and remains the sacred duty of every Soviet citizen.

　　苏联武装部长发布五一命令
    号召保持战斗准备  继续捍卫民主利益
    【新华社陕北三日电】莫斯科广播：苏联武装部长布尔加宁陆军上将于五一节对苏联陆海军将士发表命令，略称：
    苏联陆海军正在进行战斗与政治训练，充分吸收伟大爱国战争的经验，精通斯大林军事科学，来迎接五一节。苏联人民在高度的劳动与政治热潮中纪念五一节。全国的社会主义竞赛，正在各地普遍展开，准备隆重纪念伟大的社会主义十月革命第三十周年。全国人民，在共产党和伟大领袖、导师斯大林同志领导下，在和平劳动的战线上，坚决克服战后的困难，赢得一次又一次的胜利。苏联的外交政策，始终一致，为着民主和平的巩固，和各民族间友爱合作的加强而积极奋斗；已经获得全世界进步力量的赞助与拥护。我们的武装部队应当保障苏联公民和平的劳动和苏联国家的利益。为了有效地完成这个任务，武装部队必须继续保持他们的战斗准备。海陆军的战士们和士官们应当谨慎地学习战争艺术，以继续在将来也成为干练的战斗员。最近几天内，就要开始战斗准备的最重要阶段——夏季训练时期。在这一时期内，陆海空军必须奋起获取军事政治训练的新成就，卓越地完成交给他们的任务。苏联的战士们，在伟大的爱国战争的年月里，已经作出英雄主义战斗技术和效忠祖国的榜样；目前，在和平时期里，全体武装部队应当像战时一样，保持苏联战士的崇高的荣誉和尊严，应当是组织模范和纪律模范，竭智尽力，为祖国服务！为了纪念劳动人民的国际节日，我命令：今天，五一节，在我们祖国的京城莫斯科，在苏联各盟邦的京城里，也在加里宁格勒、罗夫、哈巴、罗甫斯克、海参威和旅顺，并在列宁格勒、斯大林格勒、塞巴斯托波尔和奥德萨这几个英雄的城市里，各鸣礼炮二十响。
    【新华社陕北四日电】莫斯科广播：五月二日真理报发表社论，略称：五一节的庆祝，再度向全世界说明：苏联全体人民像一个人一样的拥护斯大林外交政策，这种政策引向巩固的民主的和平，符合各国劳动人民的基本利益。在五一节我们人民向全世界宣告：他们有着继续保卫民主利益的充分准备；苏联人民有着伟大的目的——在我们国家内继续共产主义的建设。但是，如斯大林说过的——当我们扩展和平建设时，决不能有一刹那间忘记了怀抱着新战争计划的世界反动势力的阴谋。必须记得伟大的列宁的话：在重新开始和平劳动之后，我们必须经常警惕着，重视我们国家的武装力量和自卫能力。如同重视我们的眼睛珠子一样。真理报社论结论说：爱护苏维埃武装力量曾经是并且仍然是每一个苏联公民的神圣责任。
