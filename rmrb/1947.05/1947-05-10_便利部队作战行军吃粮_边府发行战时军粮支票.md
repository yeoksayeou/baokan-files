　　To facilitate troop access to food in combat areas and during marches, and to reduce the time wasted in allocating grain back and forth, the Border Region Government has issued wartime military grain vouchers. The vouchers are in loose-leaf form. The first page contains the total amount of grain approved for disbursement and the cumulative amount to be paid within a specified period. The following ten pages are blank. Troops can fill in the numbers according to their daily or mealtime grain needs, within the approved total amount, and exchange them for grain at nearby county warehouses or supply stations. To ensure that troops can redeem the grain and to prevent speculation in grain trading, regulations stipulate that redeemed grain can only be consumed and not taken away, and can only be redeemed for the types of grain specified on the voucher, without conversion. In particular, it is forbidden to redeem grain at village storage facilities or for government and civilian personnel to use the vouchers. These vouchers are not restricted by region.
