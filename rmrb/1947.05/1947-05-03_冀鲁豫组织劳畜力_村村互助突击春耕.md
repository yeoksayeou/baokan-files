[This article comes from this newspaper's own reporting] Hebei-Shandong-Henan Organizes Labor and Livestock
    Villages Help Each Other in Rush Spring Plowing
    [Our newspaper's Hebei-Shandong-Henan dispatch on the 1st] Various counties in Hebei-Shandong-Henan are implementing large-scale mutual aid and actively carrying out spring plowing. In Yangdikou Village, Zhangqiu First District, there are 59 households with 334 people, but only 38 full laborers, 16 semi-laborers, and 17 livestock, of which only 5 are usable. There are 11 military and family members with three hectares of spring land, truly a case of "many tasks, few people, and short time." Based on this situation, everyone discussed a spring plowing mutual aid method: all full and semi-laborers in the village are organized into three mutual aid groups, using livestock for harrowing and manpower for pushing manure and pulling rollers, planning to complete all plowing in 20 days. It has been underway for four days, and all men, women, old, and young in the village are very happy. After the land reform in Zhuzhuang Village, Zhangqiu Fourth District, the masses' enthusiasm for production is very high, but the village has very few livestock and must also conduct a review. In order not to delay the farming season, they implemented "collective labor and unified work" and stipulated labor discipline such as getting up at dawn and not having idle people, and exemplary conditions such as working more, working better, resting early, and resting late. It has been underway for seven days, with a total of 16 hectares harrowed and manure completely delivered for 187 households. In Fanzhuzhuang Village, Fan County First District, the masses were allocated 200 mu of land in other villages during the land reform, most of which is spring land. The village has fewer livestock, and scattered cultivation would delay the farming season. At the village-wide mass meeting, a method was discussed: all the livestock in the village are organized to rush harrow and plow the land, and the labor force is also organized to work in shifts pulling rollers. In Shazhuang Village, Qingfeng Second District, in order not to delay spring plowing, all the more than ten cattle in the village were organized, and experienced and reliable people were elected to preside, dividing into groups to harrow the land, regardless of which household the land belonged to. Whenever they encountered spring land, they harrowed it, which saved a lot of effort. In just over a day, all the spring land was harrowed.

　　冀鲁豫组织劳畜力
    村村互助突击春耕
    【本报冀鲁豫一日电】冀鲁豫各县实行大互助，积极进行春耕，张秋一区杨堤口全村五十九户，三百三十四人，仅有三十八名全劳力，十六名半劳力，十七头牲口，只有五头管用。军工属十一家，有三顷春地，真是“活多人少时候短”。根据这种情形，大家讨论出春耕大互助的办法：全村全半劳力共组织三个互助组，耙地用牲口，推粪拉砘用人力，计划二十天全部耕完。现已进行四日，全村男女老幼都很高兴。张秋四区朱庄土地改革后，群众生产情绪很高，但全村牲口很少，又要进行复查，为不误农时，乃实行“集体劳动统一干活”，并规定天明即起，不闲一人等劳动纪律，和作多作好早作晚歇等模范条件，现已进行七天，计耙地十六顷，一百八十七户的粪完全送完。范县一区范祝庄群众在土地改革中分到外村土地二百亩，大部分是春地，该村牲口较少，分散耕种会误农时，在全村群众大会上商量出办法：全村所有牲口组织起来，突击耙地、犁地，劳动力也组织起来分班拉砘子。清丰二区沙庄为了不误春耕，把全村余十犋牲口都组织起来，选举老练妥当的人来主持，分组耙地，不分地属谁家，遇到春地就耙，这样很省工夫，只一天多的时间便把所有春地耙完了。
