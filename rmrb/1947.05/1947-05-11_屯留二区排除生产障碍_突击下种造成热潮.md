　　Tunliu Second District Overcomes Production Obstacles
    Urgent Sowing Creates Upsurge
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch of the 9th] The Second District of Tunliu has overcome the fear of getting rich, and the production movement is flourishing. At the beginning of spring plowing, the leadership found that the masses generally had ideological obstacles such as "fear of corvée labor," "fear of getting rich," "fear of lack of freedom in mutual aid," and "emphasizing sideline occupations over agriculture." In response to this situation, the following measures were taken: First, the corvée labor was rectified. In villages such as Wangzhuang and Quzhuang, in addition to establishing logistics committees to rectify corvée labor to lead production, new regulations were made for preferential treatment for military families in farming: All land owned by military families without labor or animal power should be farmed on their behalf. For military families with animal or human power, each full laborer should have 15 mu of cultivated land deducted, each first-class livestock should have 20 mu deducted, and each second-class livestock should have 15 mu deducted. For the remaining land, each mu should receive four days of preferential labor and one day of animal power per year. If military families can save the labor that should be given preferential treatment, they can exchange it for rice at the village office. Using these methods, Quzhuang saved half of the labor for preferential treatment for military families compared to previous years. After in-depth publicity and organization throughout the district, most women and children participated in the main labor. After the conscripted laborers from each village left for the front, production was not affected in the slightest. The second is to dispel the "fear of struggle" ideology. This ideology mainly exists among middle peasants. Yang Jiuxiang, a middle peasant in Lucun, sold his donkey last year because he was afraid of struggle, and planted his crops haphazardly. The village cadres convened a "heart-to-heart meeting" of poor, hired, and middle peasants, and everyone "beat the drums face to face" to raise and solve the problems, so that everyone could concentrate on production. Yang Jiuxiang bought a donkey again. In terms of mutual aid, slogans such as voluntary association, self-determination of systems, and equivalent exchange were put forward, and the masses broke the doubts about the lack of freedom in mutual aid. Quzhuang organized five mutual aid groups in five days, with the number of participants accounting for more than 80% of the village. The same organization occurred in twelve villages such as Lucun and Qishi. The "emphasizing sideline occupations over agriculture" ideology is due to only looking at immediate benefits. When Yuanzhuang saw that spring plowing had begun, the masses were still going to market and transporting goods, and no one was carrying manure or plowing the land. The leadership put forward the slogan of "double enrichment," explaining that agriculture is fundamental, and asked everyone to engage in agriculture before engaging in sideline occupations, and to establish the idea of getting rich through farming. At this time, the problem of lack of labor and animal power followed. According to statistics from ten villages including Laojunzhuang, Lucun, Qishi, and Dongxi Xingwang, each yoke of livestock had to cultivate an average of 230 mu of land. Each laborer in Quzhuang, Guozhuang, and Lucun had to plant 35 mu of land. The district production committee went to various villages to adjust livestock and organize mobile plowing teams to plow for the villages with the most livestock shortages. At the same time, they vigorously organized people to pull plows. Twenty-five women in Qishi plowed 38 mu of land by pulling plows in five days, not only without leaving any land uncultivated, but also eliminating the 175 mu of cultivated wasteland from last year. After all obstacles were resolved, the masses' enthusiasm for production was extremely high. The nine key villages in the district successively organized visiting teams to learn from each other. Quzhuang also challenged Qishi, and the entire village completed the sowing of 3,000 mu of land in fifteen days. More than twenty villages including Dongxingwang also sowed half of their land. Even a village like Laojunzhuang, which lacked labor, did not leave a single mu of land uncultivated.

　　屯留二区排除生产障碍
    突击下种造成热潮
    【本报太岳九日电】屯留二区克服怕发财思想，生产运动蓬勃发展。春耕开始时，领导上发现群众普遍的存有“怕差务”、“怕发财”、“怕互助不自由”、“重副业轻农业”的思想障碍。针对此种情况，采取了以下办法：首先进行差务的整顿；王庄、曲庄等村，除成立后勤委员会整顿差务领导生产外，并对优军代耕做了新的规定：凡无劳力、畜力之军属所有土地全部代耕，而有畜力或人力之军属，接每个全劳力扣除耕地十五亩，每头甲等牲畜扣除二十亩，乙等扣除十五亩，剩余之土地每亩全年优待人工四个，畜力一个。军属如能节省应优待的工，可向村公所兑米。应用这些办法，曲庄较往年节省优军劳力一半。全区经深入宣传组织起来，大部妇女儿童均参加主要劳动，各村参战民夫走后，丝毫未影响生产。其次是解除“怕斗争”思想。此种思想主要存在于中农间。路村中农杨九祥去年怕斗争把毛驴也卖了，庄稼马马虎虎种上，村干部召集了个贫雇中农“表心会”，大家“当面锣鼓对面敲”，把问题提出解决了，才都歇心闹生产，杨九祥重新买了一头驴。在互助上提出自愿结合，自订制度，等价交换等口号，群众才打破互助不自由的疑虑。曲庄五天组织了五个互助组，参加人数占全村百分之八十以上，路村、碛石等十二个村都是如此组织起来的。“重副业轻农业”思想，是由于光看眼前利来的。原庄眼看春耕开始了，群众仍是赶集运输，无人担粪、犁地，领导上提出：“双料发财”的口号，说明农业是根本，叫大家搞了农业再搞副业，树立务农发财思想。这时劳力畜力缺乏的问题接着来了，据老君庄、路村、碛石、东西兴旺等十村的统计，每犋牲口平均要耕地二百卅亩，曲庄、郭庄、路村每个劳力须种地三十五亩，区生产委员会便分头到各村调剂牲口，组织流动代耕队，到牲畜最缺乏的村庄代耕，同时又大力组织人拉犁。碛石二十五个妇女，五天中人拉犁犁地三十八亩，不但未荒地，并消灭了去年的一百七十五亩熟荒。一切障碍问题解决后，群众生产热潮极高，全区九个基点村，先后都组织了参观队，互相学习。曲庄并向碛石挑战，全村三千亩土地，十五天便完成下种。东兴旺等二十余村亦下种一半，就连老君庄那样缺乏劳力的村子亦未荒一亩地。
