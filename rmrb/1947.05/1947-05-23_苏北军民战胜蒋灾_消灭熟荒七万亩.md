Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 21st -- In the land review and spring plowing production in the Northern Jiangsu Liberated Area, a large amount of abandoned cultivated land has been eliminated. In the five districts of Ye Ting County, more than 68,000 mu of nearly 80,000 mu of abandoned cultivated land has been eliminated. In the Gou Dun District of Jianyang, it has also been reduced from more than 13,000 mu to 2,000 mu. Since Jiang's army invaded Northern Jiangsu, the four districts of Huai'an alone have lost 559 head of livestock and 1,873 pieces of farm equipment. Coupled with the harassment of Jiang's army, a large amount of abandoned cultivated land has been created. During this spring's review, due to in-depth mobilization and government issuance of agricultural loans, the amount of abandoned cultivated land has been greatly reduced. It is estimated that Qinglou District of Ye Ting alone can increase grain production by 10,000 shi.

　　苏北军民战胜蒋灾
    消灭熟荒七万亩
    【新华社华中二十一日电】苏北解放区在土地复查及春耕生产中消灭了大量熟荒。叶挺县五个区近八万亩熟荒已消灭六万八千余亩。建阳沟墩区亦由一万三千余亩减至两千亩。自蒋军侵入苏北，仅淮安四个区即损失牲口五百五十九头，农具一千八百七十三件。加之蒋军骚扰，致造成大量熟荒，今春复查时，由于动员深入及政府发放农贷，熟荒大量减少，仅叶挺庆楼区预计可增产粮食一万石。
