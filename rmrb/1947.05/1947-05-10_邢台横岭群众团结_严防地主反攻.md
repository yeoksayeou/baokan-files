　　Xingtai Hengling Masses Unite, Strictly Guard Against Landlord Counterattacks
    [Our Dispatch] In March, when Hengling Village, Eleventh District of Xingtai, began to organize mutual aid and prepare for large-scale production, the village cadres conducted a study on how to prevent landlords from taking the opportunity to counterattack. They reviewed the experience of struggles in the past few years and unanimously agreed that: the reason why landlords were able to carry out sabotage after each previous movement was mainly because two important issues had not been resolved or had been resolved very incompletely. One was that the connection between the masses and the landlords had not been completely severed, and the landlords' words and deeds still maintained a certain degree of influence and deceptive effect among some of the masses; the other was that everyone lacked the concept of supervising and educating the landlords at all times and for a long time. Based on this understanding, the village cadres led the masses to launch extensive discussions, letting everyone carefully examine what connections they still had with the landlords that had not been completely severed. As a result of everyone's in-depth reflection, it was discovered that a large number of the masses still had thoughts of not breaking face with the landlords and pitying the landlords. Some liberated peasants were always embarrassed to completely ignore the landlords, and some women even secretly sent rice and flour to the landlords. If these muddled ideas cannot be completely eliminated, the final connection between the masses and the landlords cannot be completely severed. Over time, the masses' understanding will gradually become blurred and be used by the landlords. Therefore, the village cadres focused on these issues and guided everyone to further discuss them. When everyone fully exposed the cruelty and ruthlessness of the landlords towards the poor from their past suffering, these muddled ideas were completely eliminated. They unanimously said: "We pity him now, but he has never pitied us! In the famine years, the landlords ate rice, steamed buns, and white noodle soup, but when we went to their door to beg for food, they didn't even give us a cornbread!" "Before, when they were rich and powerful, who paid attention to us poor fellows? Even if you try to please them, they wouldn't even bother to look at you!" They also deeply realized from the landlords' repeated sabotage activities in the past years that: "The reason why the landlords are so close to us now is not because they really look up to us, but because they want to win us over! If we are not careful again, we will slowly fall into the trap of those bastards again. We must be careful of the landlords' actions in the future!" In this way, the connection between the masses and the landlords was finally severed, and the landlords were truly and thoroughly isolated. At the same time, it also raised everyone's vigilance and launched a mass campaign to prevent landlord sabotage. (Xi Min)

　　邢台横岭群众团结
    严防地主反攻
    【本报讯】三月间，邢台十一区横岭村，着手整理互助，准备进行大生产时，村干对如何防止地主乘机反攻问题作了一番研究。他们检讨了过去几年来的斗争经验，一致认为：以前每次运动过去以后，地主所以能够进行破坏，主要的是由于有两个重要问题还没有解决或解决的极不彻底。一个是群众和地主的联系尚未完全割断，地主的言论行动，在一部分群众中依然保持着它一定程度的影响和欺骗作用；另外一个是大家对地主缺乏随时监督和长期教育的观念。根据这种认识，村干部就领导群众展开了广泛的讨论，让每一个人都来仔细的检查一下，看看自己跟地主之间，究竟还有些什么联系没有完全割断。经过大家深入反省的结果，便发现了有一大部分群众尚有跟地主打不破情面和怜悯地主的思想。有些翻身农民总是不好意思完全不理地主，有的妇女甚至偷偷的给地主送米送面。这些糊涂思想如果不能彻底肃清，群众跟地主之间的最后联系，也就不能够完全割断，日子久了群众的认识便会慢慢的模糊起来，为地主所利用。于是村干就针对着这些问题，引导大家更深入的讨论下去，当大家从自己过去所受的痛苦中把地主对待穷人的残酷无情完全揭露时，这些糊涂思想就完全肃清了，他们一致说：“咱现在可怜他，可是他从来也没有可怜过咱呀！灾荒年，地主吃的是米面馍馍白面条子汤，咱到人家门上去要饭，人家连个糠窝窝也没有给咱呀！”“以前人家有钱有势的时候，谁答理过咱们这些穷小子呢？你尽着招呼人家，人家连眼皮都不想抬呢？”他们并从过去地主屡年的破坏活动中，深刻的认识到：“地主现在跟咱这样近附，并不是真看得起咱，他是想拉拢咱哩！咱们如果再不小心，慢慢的就又上了狗日的圈套了，咱以后可得当心地主的行事呵！”这样一来，群众和地主间的连系，才算是最后给割断了，把地主真正彻底孤立起来；同时，也提高了大家的警惕，展开了群众性的防止地主破坏。（西民）
