(From) This Newspaper, Pingshun: After rain on May 1st in the Fifth District, a sudden push to plant cotton for three days resulted in a total of 6,000 mu of cotton planted across the district, accounting for 14% of the autumn land, with an average of just over one mu of cotton planted per household. The best completion was in Dongqingbei, where the whole village planted 505 mu of cotton, accounting for 24% of the autumn land, averaging two and a third mu per household. There were twelve villages in the district where every household planted cotton. The above achievements were obtained in a very short period of three days, mainly by adopting methods such as mass ideological mobilization, precise calculation, and unified mutual aid. Cadres and labor heroes played a leading role. Secondly, the lessons of failure in cotton planting last year were summarized, so not only was the planting fast, but it also guaranteed that the cotton seedlings emerged from the soil well.

　　平顺五区雨后抢种
    三天种棉六千亩
    【本报平顺讯】五区于五月一日落雨后，突击种棉三天，全区共种棉六千亩，占秋地百分之十四，平均每户种棉一亩多。完成最好的是东青北，全村种棉五百零五亩，占秋地百分之二十四，每户合二亩三分。全区家家户户种棉的有十二个村。在很短的三天内，获得以上成绩，主要是采取了群众性的思想动员的精确计算统一变工等方法，干部、劳动英雄起了带头作用；其次是总结了去年种棉中的失败经验，因此不仅种的快，而且保证花苗很好出土。
