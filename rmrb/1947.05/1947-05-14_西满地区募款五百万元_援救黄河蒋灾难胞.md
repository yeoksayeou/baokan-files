    [Xinhua News Agency, Jinjiluyu, 12th] Jiang troops shell employees repairing dikes and fighting floods along the Jiluyu River. On April 9th, Jiang's troops used artillery and machine guns to bombard the masses repairing dikes in the second district of Juancheng, causing 28 casualties. On the morning of the 22nd, Jiang troops stationed in Zhaizhuang and Liuzhuang in Pingyin, shelled Huwudu in Hexi County (newly designated county, western Changqing) across the river, killing and injuring many residents. Jiang troops stationed in Houzhuang and Weizhuang in Changqing, fired across the river at the dike repairing masses in Zhangcun and Caozhuang every day, forcing the dike repairing project there to be interrupted from time to time. From the 26th to the 28th, Jiang's troops sneaked to less than four miles from the Zhonggudui dangerous section of the Ju Yuncheng, and continuously bombarded the flood-fighting masses with guns and artillery day and night. At 11:00 am on the 28th, a US-made Jiang aircraft sneaked over the dangerous section and strafed the flood-fighting workers with machine guns. On the 29th, before dawn, more than 200 Jiang troops sneaked to the dam and opened fire, bombarding residents in Hebei, killing and wounding several villagers in Linlou.
