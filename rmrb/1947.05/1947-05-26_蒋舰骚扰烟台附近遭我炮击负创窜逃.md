　　Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 22nd—In recent months, Chiang Kai-shek ships have been increasingly rampant in harassing various ports along the Jiaodong coast. At 11:00 AM on the 11th, a Chiang Kai-shek ship sailed from the northwest to a point more than ten li from the coast of Yantai and hijacked a sailboat from Tianjin that was buying and selling fresh fish. It approached Zhifu Island, firing more than 30 shells at a point five li from the shore. A sharpshooter from a certain unit of the Yantai garrison swiftly returned fire, with two shots hitting the target. One shell hit the stern of the Chiang Kai-shek ship, and the other hit next to the bridge. The enemy was wounded and fled in a northeasterly direction. The hijacked sailboat was immediately rescued and safely arrived in Yantai. At about 6:00 AM that day, another Chiang Kai-shek ship fired artillery from 40 to 50 li offshore. At 9:00 PM that night, it used searchlights for reconnaissance.

　　蒋舰骚扰烟台附近遭我炮击负创窜逃
    【新华社山东二十二日电】近月来蒋舰在胶东沿海各口岸之骚扰日益猖狂。十一日上午十一时，蒋舰一艘由西北方向驶至距烟台海岸十余里处劫持由天津来烟贩买鲜鱼之风船一只，并逼近芝罘岛距岸五里处打炮三十余发。烟台市驻军某部神炮手迅予还击，两发均告命中，一弹中蒋舰尾，一弹中舰楼旁，敌负创惊向东北方向逸去，被劫之风船立即获救，安抵烟台。当日六时许，又有蒋舰一艘远离海岸四五十里轰炮，入夜九时并以探照灯放射侦察。
