　　The People's Liberation Army Has Extremely High Quality
    Chiang Kai-shek's Army Has Low Morale
    Li Shouzheng Compares the Strengths and Weaknesses of the Two Armies
    [Reported by this newspaper] Li Shouzheng, Major General and Brigade Commander of the 49th Brigade of Chiang's army, recently arrived at the base of the Jinji-Hebei-LuYu Military Region from the front lines of northern Henan. Wang Shiying, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Military Region, met with him a few days ago, hoping that Li would dispel his doubts and fears about the People's Liberation Army and study diligently in the Liberated Areas. When Li Shouzheng learned that Deputy Chief of Staff Wang was a graduate of Whampoa Military Academy, he felt very ashamed. Li said of his impressions after arriving in the Liberated Areas: "After coming to the Liberated Areas, I understood many issues and saw that Mr. Mao Zedong was very farsighted; especially after reading Mr. Mao's works, I felt truly relaxed and happy." Then, based on his own experience, Li Shouzheng said very confidently: "It is impossible to eliminate your army. I had this understanding before, and after this battle in Qixian County, I have a deeper understanding." When Deputy Chief of Staff Wang asked him for his opinions on the People's Liberation Army, Li said: "You Communists and the People's Liberation Army have many advantages and few shortcomings. Your cooperation between the army and the people is good, your morale is high, and your tactics are flexible. We have seen your spirit of cooperation between the army and the people, and everyone admires it. This is impossible to achieve on that side (referring to Chiang's army). I think this is the guarantee of your victory. In addition, because of your cooperation between the army and the people, your intelligence is rapid and accurate, and your political work system is very good, so your soldiers have high political quality and high morale. In my opinion, we over there only have one advantage, that is, our equipment and technology are better. However, your army's equipment and technology have also greatly improved." When Deputy Chief of Staff Wang asked about the situation of laying down arms, Li Shouzheng said: "Our general officers and soldiers are war-weary. After the victory of the eight-year war of resistance, everyone hoped for peace and hoped to return home to demobilize." Li expressed to reporters that he admired General Liu Bocheng very much. He said: "There is no one in the army on the front line of northern Henan (referring to Chiang's army) who does not know General Liu Bocheng; even the common people all know him."

　　解放军素质极高
    蒋家军士气低落
    李守正比较两军优劣
    【本报讯】蒋军四十九旅少将旅长李守正，最近从豫北前线到达晋冀鲁豫军区驻地，军区副参谋长王世英将军于日前予以接见，并希李氏对人民解放军消除怀疑和恐惧，安心在解放区好好学习。李守正知道王副参谋长是黄埔同学时，顿觉非常惭愧。李氏谈到解放区后的观感称：“来到解放区后，我了解了很多问题，看到了毛泽东先生很有远见；尤其看了毛先生的著作，真觉得轻松愉快。”接着，李守正从他本身的经验很肯定的说：“要想消灭你们的军队是不可能的，从前我就有这个认识，经过这次在淇县作战后，我体会得更加深刻了。”当王副参谋长征询他对人民解放军有何意见时，李氏说：“你们共产党和解放军，优点多，缺点少，你们军民合作好、士气旺盛，战术战斗灵活。你们军民合作的精神，我们看到了，没有一个人不佩服的。这在那方面（指蒋军）是无论如何做不到的。我想这就是你们要胜利的保证。此外由于你们军民合作，你们的情报迅速确实，你们的政治工作制度很好，所以贵军战士政治素质高，士气旺盛。我们那边，据我看来只有一个优点，就是装备和技术比较好。可是贵军的装备和技术，也大大提高了。王副参谋长问到放下武器的情形时，李守正说：“我们一般的官兵是厌战的，抗战八年胜利后，大家都希望和平，都希望复员回家。”李氏对记者表示：他很钦佩刘伯承将军，他说：“在豫北前线的军队（指蒋军），没有不知道刘伯承将军的；就是老百姓，也人人知道”。
