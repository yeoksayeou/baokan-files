Speed Up Planting, Strive for Meritorious Service: Women and Children Are a Great Help
Heshun Second District Completes Planting of 66,000 Mu Ahead of Schedule

[This newspaper Heshun News] On May 13th, the Heshun Second District convened a meeting of all district cadres to summarize the rush planting work. The entire district had 3,922 male full laborers and 2,213 semi-laborers, with 100,280 mu of land. By the time the militia, stretcher bearers, and transport teams departed for the front lines on April 25th, only over 30,000 mu had been planted. The personnel participating in the war were all selected, capable full laborers. At that time, the planting was at its most intense stage. Under the mobilization of all forces to support the front lines in conjunction with completing the arduous task of rush planting, the masses and cadres in the rear had the following thoughts: (1) Worry about not being able to plant. (2) Going to the front lines to participate in the war earns meritorious service, while staying in the rear to suffer death earns no merit. During the discussion of this issue, Li Xiqing said: "Participating in the war on the front lines is certainly arduous and earns great merit, but failing to do a good job of planting in the rear also affects the fighting on the front lines. Both the front and rear contribute equally." After this discussion, thoughts were clarified, and confidence surged, with everyone striving to earn meritorious service in the rush planting, greatly promoting the rapid development of planting work. Each village calculated labor, livestock, and land to mobilize auxiliary labor, women, and children to participate in planting. In this area, women historically did not have the habit of going to the fields. Initially, some people believed that women were not useful and unreliable. For example, Zhang Maocheng said: "Children are not useful. Going to the fields is also afraid of wolves eating them, and an adult has to follow them to watch out for wolves." The hero Li Baohai's group, which had turned over, organized five children to go to the fields with adults for half a day to plant eight mu, and all the children in the village also went to the fields. The Wen Yuan Village Production Committee put forward the slogan: Women and children participate in planting, if they can't add a catty, they can add two; if they can't add a shirt, they can add a sleeve; if they can't plow the land, they can plant; do what they can; if you don't plant in the spring, you won't eat in the autumn; plant one more mu, harvest one more mu of grain. Under the mobilization of this powerful slogan, women and children universally participated in production planting and logistics work: planting seeds, carrying manure, carrying water, pulling drills, delivering meals, wives looking after children, cooking, standing guard, being on the lookout, young and middle-aged women participating in delivering letters, villages relaying light colored signals to other villages, boiling water in reception centers, and other work, with great enthusiasm. Four women in Chenjia Village pulled a drill, paired with an old man to control the drill, and completed the planting of grain. In Hehui, Lingnan, Songgou, Chenjia Village and other villages, there was no water to drink due to drought, and carrying water from eight miles away was the task of women and children. More than 200 women in Niuchuan participated in carrying manure. A total of 4,679 women and 2,616 children participated in planting in the entire district, planting 36,804 mu in half a month, for a total of 66,804 mu. The method of rush planting: unified use of labor, small groups merged into large groups, groups adjusted labor with each other, planting one thing after another. Differential tickets were printed. Personnel participating in the war ate at public expense, with a daily standard of ten points. The standard score for rear production was ten points. Good performers could be awarded points, and poor performers could have points deducted. The wages for differential tickets and work tickets were the same and could be exchanged with each other. The participation of women and children in planting also freed up the labor for those participating in the war. Not only was planting not significantly affected, but it was planted six or seven days earlier than in previous years.

　　加速下种争取立功妇女儿童顶了大用
    和顺二区六万六千亩地提前种完
    【本报和顺讯】五月十三号和顺二区召开全体区干部会议，总结突击下种工作。全区男全劳力三千九百二十二个，半劳力二千二百一十三个，土地十万零二千八百亩，于四月二十五号全区参战的民兵、担架、运输队出发前线时只下种了三万余亩，参战人员都是选择出来的精明强干的全劳力，当时的下种正在最紧张的阶段，在动员一切力量支援前线结合完成突击下种这个艰巨的任务下，后方的群众干部有以下几种思想：（一）怕下不上种的发愁思想。（二）去前线参战能立功，在后方受死也无功。在大家讨论这个问题中，李喜庆说：“参战到前线当然是吃苦功劳大，后方搞不好下种也影响前线打仗，前后方同样有功。”经过这样讨论，思想通了，信心高涨起来，个个争取在突击下种中立功，大大推动了下种工作的迅速开展。各村都是经过全村计算劳、畜力、土地来发动辅助劳力妇女、儿童参加下种，这个地区的妇女，历来没有上地的习惯，开始有一部分群众认为妇女不顶用，靠不住。如张茂成说：“儿童可不顶用，去地还怕狼吃了，还得跟一个大人看狼啦。”翻身英雄李保孩组，有五个儿童组织起来跟上大人到地半天搭茬八亩，全村的儿童也上地了。温源村生产委员会提出口号：妇女儿童参加下种，不能添个斤，也能添个两，不能添个衬，也能添个袖，不能耕地能下种，能做什么就做什么；春天种不下秋天吃不上；多种一亩地，多收一亩地的粮。在这有力的口号动员下，妇女、儿童普遍参加了生产下种及后勤工作：下种籽、抬粪、抬水、拉耧、送饭，老婆看孩、做饭、站岗、放哨，青壮年妇女参加送信，村与村转送轻彩号，在招待所烧开水等工作，劲头很大。陈家庄四个妇女拉一张耧，配一个老汉掌耧即完成种谷。河会、岭南、松沟、陈家庄等村天旱没有水吃，一出八里地抬水都是妇女儿童的任务。牛川二百多妇女参加抬粪，全区参加下种的妇女四千六百七十九个，儿童二千六百一十六个，半个月内下种三万六千八百零四亩，共下种了六万六千八百零四亩。突击下种的方法：统一使用劳力，小组合并成大组，组与组调剂劳力，种完一样种一样。制印了差票，参战人员吃公家，每天标准分十分。后方生产标准分十分，好者可奖分，坏者可减分。差票与工票的工资是一样，能互相兑换。妇女儿童参加了下种将参战的工也赶出来了，不但下种没有受到大的影响，反比往年早种六、七天。
