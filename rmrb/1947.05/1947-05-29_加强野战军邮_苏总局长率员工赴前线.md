Strengthening Field Army Postal Service
	Director of the Soviet Postal Administration Leads Staff to the Front Lines

[Report from this newspaper's Jinnan Bureau] To adapt to the victorious development of the military situation in this region, more powerfully support the war, and closely connect the front and rear, it is urgently necessary to strengthen the field army postal service. For this reason, the Jinnan District Bureau specially consulted with the Director of the Soviet Postal Administration and decided that the administration and the trade union should simultaneously issue calls, mobilizing all employees to clearly understand the current situation, highly promote confidence in victory, and actively participate in military postal work. After deliberation in various counties, everyone responded enthusiastically. The Wei County Bureau was the first to have six people sign up, and others from other bureaus also came to the District Bureau to request participation. It is currently decided to first select thirty-five people, who will be led by the Director of the Soviet Postal Administration himself to the front lines of northern Henan on the 22nd of this month.
