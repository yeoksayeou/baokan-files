　　Qiushuyuan Village Launches Crash Planting
    Expanding Planting of Superior Varieties
    [This newspaper, Licheng News] Qiushuyuan Village is paying attention to getting through to the masses ideologically and promoting superior varieties during the crash planting. The entire base point planted 811 millet on 764 mu, Jin Huanghou (Golden Queen) corn on 444 mu, cotton on 697 mu, sesame on 48 mu, and both large and small hemp on 309 mu. The cooperatives in each village played a role in regulating seeds, with some running to the Xijing area to buy 811 millet seeds. The labor heroes in each village also played a very good role in promotion. Labor hero Jia Qiutian from Longwangmiao mobilized everyone in the people's school to plant more cotton and 811 millet. He said, "Last year, our village listened to the government and planted Golden Queen. Each mu yielded an average of 1.5 shi of grain, while local corn only yielded an average of 0.8 shi per mu. Planting Golden Queen is equivalent to harvesting from two mu." After such mobilization and individual persuasion, once the masses' thinking was cleared, the widespread development of planting superior varieties became possible. (An Shun, Si Qing, He Wang)

　　秋树垣村突击下种
    扩大种植优良品种
    【本报黎城讯】秋树垣村突击下种中注意打通群众思想，推广优良品种。全基点共种八一一谷七百六十四亩，金皇后玉茭四百四十四亩，棉花六百九十七亩，芝麻四十八亩，大小麻三百零九亩。各村合作社在调剂种籽上起了作用，有的跑到西井一带买八一一谷种籽。各村劳英也起很好的推广作用，龙王庙劳动英雄贾秋田在民校动员大家多种棉花、八一一谷，他说：“去年咱村听了政府话，种了金皇后，每亩平均收粮一石五斗，土玉茭每亩平均只收八斗，种金皇后一亩足顶二亩收。”这样动员，与个别说服，群众的思想打通后，多种优良品种才有了普遍的开展。（安顺、思庆、何旺）
