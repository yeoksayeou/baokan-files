　　Xinhua News Agency, West Manchuria, 4th: The unprecedentedly grand Inner Mongolia People's Representative Conference solemnly opened on April 23rd at the foot of the Genghis Khan Temple in Wangye Temple. Three hundred and ninety-two representatives from all regions, representing two million people of Inner Mongolia, gathered together. Comrade Zhang Pinghua, representative of the CCP West Manchuria Branch and the West Manchuria Military Region, the Liaobei delegation led by Chairman Yan Baohang, and Heilongjiang-Nenjiang Province Speaker Yu Tianfang and others attended the meeting to offer their congratulations. At the beginning of the conference, tributes were first paid to the revolutionary martyrs, followed by the election of a 25-member presidium of the conference headed by Yun Ze, Secretary-General of the Conference Ha Feng'a, Deputy Secretary-Generals Kui Bi, Temuer Bagen, and a 10-member proposal review committee headed by Ha Feng'a. Chairman Yun Ze, the leader of the Inner Mongolian people, delivered the opening speech, pointing out: "The convening of the Inner Mongolia People's Representative Conference is the result of the centuries-long struggle of the Inner Mongolian people. The revolutionary martyrs advanced wave upon wave, especially with the help and leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, to win the initial victory of the autonomous movement. History proves that it is shameful and bankrupt for ethnic scum like Bai Yunti to defect to Chiang Kai-shek, the Han chauvinist. The convening of the conference and the establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government will accelerate the collapse of Chiang Kai-shek's Han chauvinism. Only by uniting the entire Inner Mongolia and crushing Chiang Kai-shek's offensive can we win the complete victory of the autonomous movement." Vice Chairman Fu Yanmandu spoke, thanking the CCP and the Northeast Political Committee for their assistance to the Mongolian national liberation struggle, and believed that this People's Representative Conference was an unprecedented grand gathering since Genghis Khan. Comrade Zhang Pinghua congratulated the conference and presented the conference with the four-sentence motto: "Unite ourselves, defeat the enemy; implement autonomy, strive for self-determination." He expressed that the CCP firmly supports national self-determination and is willing to assist the liberation of the Mongolian nation with the greatest effort. He further pointed out: The establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government in the future is a necessary step to implement autonomy and strive for self-determination, and implementing autonomy is the central link in solving the struggle of the Mongolian nation today. Today, the enemies of the Mongolian nation are the running dog of US imperialism, Chiang Kai-shek, and Chiang Kai-shek's running dogs. They are attacking Mongolia and provoking national unity and Mongolian unity in order to achieve a piecemeal defeat. We must unite more closely to defeat the enemy. Chairman Yan Baohang then congratulated the neighboring ethnic groups of Liaoji. He excitedly said: "We have united and struggled and have won great victories. In the future, we must unite to the end, struggle to the end, and strive for the complete victory of the national self-defense war!" Subsequently, Speaker Yu Tianfang and others offered their congratulations. The ceremony concluded with Secretary-General Ha Feng'a reading congratulatory messages from various places, amid thunderous applause.

　　加速蒋介石大汉族主义的崩溃
    内蒙人民代表会议开幕
    【新华社西满四日电】空前盛大的内蒙人民代表会议，四月二十三日在王爷庙成吉思汗庙山下隆重开幕。来自各地代表二百万内蒙人民的三百九十二位代表，济济一堂，中共西满分局、西满军区代表张平化同志、阎宝航主席为首的辽北代表团及黑嫩省于天放议长等均赴会祝贺。大会开始，首向革命先烈致哀，继选举出以云泽为首的大会主席团二十五人，大会秘书长哈丰阿，副秘书长奎壁、特木尔巴根及以哈丰阿为首的提案审委会十人。内蒙人民领袖云泽主席致开幕词，他指出：“内蒙人民代表大会的召开，是内蒙人民数百年奋斗的结果，革命的先烈，前仆后继，特别是中国共产党的帮助与领导，争取了自治运动的初步胜利。历史证明，象民族败类白云梯之流投靠大汉族主义者蒋介石，是可耻的破产了。大会的召开与内蒙自治政府的成立，将加速蒋介石大汉族主义的崩溃，全内蒙更加团结起来，粉碎蒋介石的进攻，才能争取自治运动的彻底胜利。”傅彦满都副主席讲话中，感谢中共及东北政委曾对蒙古民族解放斗争的援助，认为这次人民代表大会是自成吉思汗以来的空前盛会。张平化同志向大会致贺，赠送大会“团结自己，战胜敌人；实行自治，争取自决”的四句警语。他表示中共是坚决赞助民族自决的，愿以最大的努力，协助蒙古民族的解放。继指出：今后内蒙自治政府的成立，是实行自治争取自决的必要步骤，实行自治则是今天蒙古民族解决斗争的中心环节。今天蒙古民族的敌人是美帝国主义的走狗蒋介石及蒋介石的走狗们，他们向蒙古进攻，挑拨民族团结、蒙古团结，以便达到各个击破；我们要更加团结起来，才能战胜敌人。阎宝航主席继向辽吉的邻居民族道喜，他兴奋的说：“我们团结奋斗，已争取到很大的胜利；今后要团结到底，奋斗到底，争取民族自卫战争的彻底胜利！”继由于天放议长等致贺。典礼于哈丰阿秘书长诵读各地贺电词后，在雷动掌声中闭幕。
