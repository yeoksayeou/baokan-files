　　Cixian Turned-Over Peasants' Stretcher Team
　　Carries Wounded Soldiers In and Out of the Line of Fire

　　[Reported from Cixian by this newspaper] The stretcher brigade organized by three thousand turned-over peasants in Cixian, under the leadership of Deputy County Magistrate Wu, put forward two major action slogans: "Carrying the wounded on the front line is the same as being a comfort group," and "Stationing in the village is the same as being a turned-over team." Under these slogans, many model militiamen and stretcher bearers have emerged.

　　Wu Xiqing and Wu Xitang, brothers, were allocated twelve and a half mu of land in the land reform. Before participating in the war, they heard that our army was going to wipe out the enemies north of the Yellow River, and they automatically signed up for the stretcher team in their village. On April 22nd, he led his stretcher near Tangyin city on the front line, transporting the wounded back and forth all night without rest, rescuing seventeen people, and buying three large steamed buns with the only 300 yuan he had on him to feed the wounded. The wounded comrades were deeply moved and said, "This kind of stretcher bearer is even better than my own brother." Cheng Youren is an old family member of a revolutionary soldier. When he set off to participate in the war, he put three liang of rock candy in his cloth bag, reluctant to eat it himself. He started feeding the first wounded soldier with the rock candy bit by bit, and left half to feed another wounded soldier. Wu Heping bought sesame cakes but was reluctant to eat them and fed them to the wounded. Li Yulin, Wu Xinmin, and Wang Zhongzheng carried a wounded soldier at night and felt cold. The three of them took off their cotton-padded coats and laid one down for the wounded to lie on, covered him with another, and used the last as a pillow. Chen Baolin, a stretcher bearer from the Second District, used his own towel to wipe the blood the wounded soldier was spitting out. The wounded soldier was very grateful and said: "You love me, and I love you." Chen Baolin said: "If it weren't for the Eighth Route Army, I wouldn't have been able to turn over." In addition, the stretcher teams in each district had very close relationships with the masses in their stationed areas. On the 18th, the stretcher teams from the Sixth and Eighth Districts arrived at ×× village in Junxian County. Everyone had walked eighty li overnight and was very tired, but as soon as they saw the poor brothers with tattered clothes, they felt like they were with their own family and forgot their fatigue. They told them the stories of the poor people turning over in the old liberated areas. The local people were very happy to hear that each person in the old liberated areas was allocated three mu of good paddy fields. Old men, children, and women all gathered around the stretcher teams to talk. An old man rushed to say: "You should have come earlier. 'Old Hu' from Pangcun is here, asking for rice, flour, and firewood every day. There's really no way to live." The children happily said: "Our troops are good, they don't beat or scold people." Under this love, a hired hand of a local tyrant knew that the Eighth Route Army allowed the poor to live a good life, so he reported the things the local tyrant had stored to the stretcher team. There were 200 zhang of foreign cloth, 10 shi of grain, and 200 pieces of clothing. The stretcher team from the Eighth District sent people to guard the property and obtained the consent of the Cixian Headquarters to distribute it to more than 300 people. On the 22nd, enemy planes dropped six bombs on Xiaozhuzhuang, east of Tangyin City, destroying eight houses and wounding five people. Participating doctor Zheng Deyi immediately applied medicine, bandaged the wounded, and removed shrapnel. The communication platoon of the Eighth District lived in ×××, and the entire platoon swept the inner and outer courtyards and streets clean. The water tanks were full. Before dawn, they all got up early to fetch water from the fields to water the gardens, and those who carried manure carried manure. Tian Liyuan, the militia company commander, delivered twelve loads of manure to the field for a 70-year-old woman, Grandma Yue. Grandma Yue took more than a dozen sesame cakes from her own small shop and insisted that he eat them. Tian Liyuan didn't eat them. Grandma Yue said: "Such a team has never been seen before in the world. They don't beat or scold, borrow something and return it, and also help us with production." Zhang Desheng and eight others from the Sixth District carried seventy-five loads of manure in their stationed village early in the morning. (Xie Tongying)

　　磁县翻身农民担架队
    出入火线抢救伤员
    【本报磁县讯】磁县三千翻身农民组织的担架大队，在吴副县长领导下，提出“火线抬彩号就是慰问团”，“驻村就是翻身队”两大行动口号。在这口号下，涌现出许多模范民兵与担架员。
    吴喜清、吴喜堂兄弟两人，翻身运动中共分到土地十二亩半，在未参战前听说咱军队要扫清黄河以北敌人，自动在村报名参加担架队。四月二十二号他领的那付担架于汤阴城附近火线上，来往转运彩号，一夜没有休息，抢救了十七名，并将自己身上带的仅有的三百元买了三个大馍给彩号吃，负伤同志大受感动说：“这样的担架，比自己的兄弟还要好。”程有仁是老抗属，参战出发时，布袋装上三两冰糖，自己舍不得吃，开始抬第一个彩号，就把冰糖打碎一口一口喂彩号吃，还丢下一半再喂一个彩号，吴河平买的烧饼没舍得吃，也喂了彩号。李玉林、吴信民、王中正三人夜间抬彩号，感到冷，他们三人便将自己的棉袄脱下来给伤员铺上一件，盖上一件，枕上一件。二区的担架队员陈保林，用自己的毛巾给彩号擦嘴里吐出来的血，彩号很感谢说：你爱我，我爱你。陈保林说：要不是八路军，我就翻不了身。此外各区担架队在驻地和群众关系非常亲切，十八那天，六、八区担架开到浚县××村，大家一夜走了八十里地，非常疲倦，但一看见当地衣衫破烂的穷弟兄，就和自家人一样，忘了疲倦，向他宣传老解放区穷人翻身故事，当地群众听到老区每人分三亩好水地，非常高兴，老汉、小孩、妇女都围着担架队交谈，一个老汉抢着说：你们早该来了，庞村“老胡”在这里，天天要米、要面、要柴，真没办法过。小孩高兴的说：咱队伍就是好，不打人不骂人。在这热爱下，一个恶霸地主的长工知道八路军让穷人好过，便把恶霸地主存的东西报告给担架队，共存洋布二百丈、粮食十石、衣服二百件。八区担架队便派人看管资财，并取得磁县指挥部同意，分配给三百多的群众。二十二号敌机向汤阴城东小朱庄投弹六枚，炸毁房子八间，有五人中弹负伤，参战医生郑德义马上给负伤群众上药缚绳带，起炸弹皮。八区通讯排在×××住，全排把住的里院外院街上扫得净净的，水缸满满的，天不明就全体早起到地里打水浇园，挑粪的挑粪，民兵连长田立元替七十多岁的老太太往地里送了十二担粪，岳老太太从自己小铺拿了十几个烧饼非叫吃不行，田立元没吃，老太太说：这样队伍天下没见过，不打不骂借什还什，还帮助咱生产。六区张德生等八个人一清早就在驻村担了七十五担粪。（谢童英）
