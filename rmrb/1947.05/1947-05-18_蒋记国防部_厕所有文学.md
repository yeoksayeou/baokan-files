　　Jiang's Ministry of National Defense "Toilet Literature"
    The Tianjin Dagong Bao reported on March 23rd: "The walls of the toilets in the News Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense in the capital are black, and many witty remarks are inscribed on them. The most bizarre of these is: 'The work of this bureau is to control the thoughts of soldiers, to urge soldiers to take the road of feudalism, and then to be the running dogs of the dynasty's princes, ministers, warlords, and financial magnates, to be at their service, to exhaust their blood and sweat, and even to faithfully annihilate their souls and bury their lives.' The indignation is overflowing."

　　蒋记国防部“厕所有文学”
    三月二十三日天津大公报载：“首都国防部新闻局厕所为黑色墙壁，其上刻划妙语甚多，如最可怪者为：“本局工作为统制军人思想，督促军人走向封建的道路，进而为本朝代王公、大臣、军阀、财阀的走狗，供其役使，出尽血汗，甚至忠实地消灭自己的灵魂与埋葬自己的生命。”愤懑情绪，溢于言表。
