　　【This newspaper Yangcheng News】The Yangcheng Post Office began on April 15th to change from day shift to night shift from Yangcheng to the Third District ××× section. Before the night shift, it took six days from Yangcheng to Xia County. After the night shift, it only takes three days, doubling the speed. On the Yangcheng to Yicheng trunk line, it used to take three days, but after changing to the night shift, it can be reached in one day and one night, tripling the speed. This achievement was developed in the enthusiastic competition among all postal workers; Sun Lianzhu, an 18-year-old postal worker, rushed to run the night shift, and on average carried more than 58 catties of mail on each shift. Older postal workers such as Li Yutang and Li Zhenbang carried 71 catties and were able to arrive early and return to the bureau early. Postal clerks have all made plans to compete for merit in the merit book, not resting all day, and conducting competitions on the condition of not making mistakes, not losing mail, and not accumulating mail.

　　阳城加设夜班邮速提高一倍
    【本报阳城讯】阳城邮局于四月十五号开始，从阳城到三分区×××段，由昼班改为夜班，改跑夜班前，由阳城到夏县需要六天，改夜班后只需三天，速度增快一倍。由阳城到翼城干线，过去需要三天，在改夜班后一天一夜就能到达，速度增快两倍。这种成绩是在全体邮工热火朝天互相竞赛中开展起来的；十八岁邮工孙练珠抢着跑夜班，并在每次出班，平均担负邮件五十八斤以上，年纪较大的李玉堂、李振邦等邮工同志，担重七十一斤，都能提前到达，提前返局。邮务员同志们都订出计划，要在功劳簿上比功，整天不休息，在以不发错、不丢失、不积压为条件开展竞赛。
