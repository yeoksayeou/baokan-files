　　Communication and Exchange

To the offices of Anyang, Tangyin, Neihuang, Hua County, Hui County, Wuzhi, Jiqi, and other counties in northern Henan:

    Please vigorously report on the work in newly recovered areas, and promptly and rapidly reflect how you are organizing forces to launch the anti-liquidation and revenge movement in the new areas, and the scale of the movement to establish a democratic order and boldly carry out land reform in the newly recovered areas. The focus is on grasping and fully exposing the crimes of the feudal tyrant ruling groups of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits Cheng Daosheng, Si Huasheng, Hu Jinlu, Wang Ziquan, Guo Qing, etc., and reflecting the people's demands for revenge struggles and their heroic actions. If there are any typical creations, please summarize and write them in a timely manner. Also, please establish communication work in newly restored areas and cities.

To the Qin County County Committee of the Taiyue Region:

    The experience you introduced in mobilizing production combined with mass movements to solve ideological leadership is very good. Please continue to report on: how to mobilize cadres and the masses to solve ideological obstacles hindering production, organize various labor mutual aid and exchange labor, and rush to plant seeds, as well as the methods for discovering and solving outstanding problems in production. It is hoped that you will seize the experience of breaking through typical cases in different types of areas and launching a movement of a certain scale, and make a comprehensive report in a timely manner. Also, we hope to mobilize correspondents to contribute to the Taiyue Xinhua Daily and this newspaper in a timely manner, so as to fully reflect the development of the movement in your county.
