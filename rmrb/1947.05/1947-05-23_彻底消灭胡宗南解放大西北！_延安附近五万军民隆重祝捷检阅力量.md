　　Thoroughly Eliminate Hu Zongnan and Liberate the Great Northwest!
    Yan'an Area 50,000 Soldiers and Civilians Solemnly Celebrate Victory and Review Strength
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Front, 21st] (Delayed) Special correspondent Lin Lang reports: To celebrate the successive great victories in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and to review the strength of the soldiers and civilians in the Border Region, a victory celebration attended by 50,000 soldiers and civilians was held at a plaza tens of miles from Yan'an on the evening of the 14th. General Peng Dehuai, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and Supreme Commander of the Northwest Liberation Army, reviewed the increasingly strong People's Regular Armed Forces and numerous newly formed guerrilla units. Countless people, countless guns, countless flags, marched majestically through the valleys and fields, converging like an iron torrent before him. They carried boiling blood, boiling hearts, and shouted boiling slogans: "Thoroughly eliminate Hu Zongnan's troops!" "Recapture Yan'an!" "Liberate the Great Northwest!" Residents within a hundred miles, armed with guns, also rushed to participate. Seeing the powerful armed forces protecting them, they excitedly revealed confident smiles. The spoils of war exhibition area was crowded with visitors; here were mountain guns, light and heavy mortars, 60mm mortars, rocket launchers, Czech-style, Canadian-style machine guns, anti-tank guns, submachine guns... This large amount of weaponry supplied to Chiang's troops by American imperialists aroused intense hatred in everyone. In addition to General Zhou Enlai, representative of the CPC Central Committee, and Comrade Xi Zhongxun, Secretary of the CPC Northwest Bureau and Political Commissar of the Northwest People's Liberation Army, those attending the meeting included labor heroes Wu Manyou, Liu Yuhou, Yang Buhao, and combat heroes in the Patriotic Self-Defense War Li Guoyu, Wang Zhenhuai, Wang Laohu, Hao Wanlong, Wang Youfu, and Li Zhaojing. When they met everyone, they were warmly cheered by the entire audience. The statistical charts of the meeting showed that from March 19 (the evacuation of Yan'an) to the beginning of April, Chiang's and Hu's troops had been annihilated by more than 23,000 men, including more than 13,000 captured alive; the Northwest People's Liberation Army received a large number of liberated soldiers who enthusiastically joined the war, and most of them equipped themselves with newly captured American-made weapons. The meeting continued for two days, and the enthusiasm of thousands upon thousands of soldiers and civilians shook the entire northern Shaanxi plateau; Hu Zongnan's troops in Yan'an did not dare to move. On the 15th, the meeting closed in the quiet of the night, filled with firm confidence in eliminating Hu Zongnan.

　　彻底消灭胡宗南解放大西北！
    延安附近五万军民隆重祝捷检阅力量
    【新华社陕北前线二十一日电】（迟到）本社特派记者林朗报导：为庆祝陕甘宁边区连次大捷与检阅边区军民的力量，边区五万军民参加的祝捷大会，十四日黄昏在距延安数十里之某地广场上举行。中国人民解放军副总司令兼西北解放军最高指挥员彭德怀将军，检阅了愈战愈强的人民正规武装和众多的新生的游击队。无数的人，无数的枪，无数的旗帜，雄壮的通过山谷和田野，象铁流一样汇聚到他的面前。他们带着沸腾的血，沸腾的心，沸腾的口号：“彻底消灭胡宗南军！”“收复延安！”“解放大西北！”百余里地以内带枪的老百姓亦纷纷赶来参加，他们见到保卫自己的强大武装，兴奋的流露着自信的微笑。战利品陈列处拥挤着参观者；这里有山炮、轻重迫击炮、六零小炮、火箭筒、捷克式、加拿大式各种机关枪、战防枪、手提机枪………。这许多由美帝国主义者供给的蒋军武器，激起每一个人的高度仇恨。出席大会者除中共中央代表周恩来将军、中共西北局书记兼西北人民解放军政治委员习仲勋同志外，还有劳动英雄吴满有、刘玉厚、杨步浩，与爱国自卫战中的战斗英雄李国玉、王振怀、王老虎、郝万龙、王有福、李兆京等。当他们和大家相见时，受到全场热烈的欢呼。大会统计图表，显示自三月十九日（延安撤退）到四月初的一个半月，蒋胡军已被歼灭二万三千余名，其中生俘一万三千余名；西北人民解放军得到大量解放战士的踊跃参战，并且大部分以新缴获美造武器装备了自己。大会继续了两天，千千万万军民的热情把整个陕北高原都震动了；胡宗南在延安的军队始终不敢动弹。十五日大会在充满消灭胡宗南的坚强信心中，于静肃的夜色中闭幕。
