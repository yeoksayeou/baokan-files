　　[This dispatch from the Taihang Office on the 30th of the month] News of victories from various liberated areas reached Licheng, and 90,000 people jubilantly held meetings to celebrate. They also launched campaigns to donate funds, write letters of慰问, and make慰问 bags to show support for the troops. According to preliminary statistics, 984,200 Jichaobi yuan in donations, 420慰问 bags, 66 vests and underpants, and 692 letters of慰问 have been sent to the front lines. The victories at the front have also boosted the production morale of the masses in the rear. The masses are trying everything possible to overcome labor shortages and cultivate the land well so that the front lines can eat their fill and dress warmly. The mutual aid team in Dongluotuo has increased from seven households to sixteen, pledging to cultivate the land well for military families and militiamen participating in the war. The village has already weeded all the wheat fields belonging to military families and militiamen participating in the war. Textile heroine Li Xiulian from Xiazhuang and the women of the whole village proposed: "We will make shoes and clothes for the militiamen participating in the war and the military families, ensuring that they have no difficulties." Jiang Haizhu, a peasant from Houchun who had his life overturned, said: "I was given houses and good land, all thanks to the sacrifices and bloodshed of the Eighth Route Army at the front. I am willing to donate 1,000 yuan to buy cigarettes for the soldiers." Teachers from twenty school districts saved 10,572 jin of millet to慰问 the front lines. Children from two school districts donated 16,987 yuan, and in addition to organizing student propaganda teams to go to the countryside to promote our army's victories, the teachers and cooks of Yigao also supported the front lines with 150 jin of millet. The students have sent out 62 letters of慰问. In her letter to her husband who is fighting on the front lines, female student Hu Xiaohuan said: "Last year, when we overturned our lives, our family was allocated 10,000 yuan in silver dollars. The village cadres and the masses are cultivating our land very well on our behalf. Please fight the enemy well! Defeat Chiang Kai-shek, and you can come back and we can work together. I am now studying at a senior primary school and also participating in textiles. Everything is fine, please don't worry."
