　　Invading Northern Shaanxi, Hu's Troops' Retreat is Cut Off
    Northwest PLA Liberates Yao County
    Over a Thousand Chiang Kai-shek Followers Captured Alive
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, Urgent Telegram, 7th] In less than twelve hours since the great victory at Panlong, a unit of the Northwest People's Liberation Army, at 10:00 AM on the 5th, liberated Yao County, less than 200 li north of Xi'an. The city, with railways and highways directly connecting to Xi'an, controls the vital transportation hub between Northern Shaanxi and Guanzhong, serving as an important base for Hu Zongnan's rear. The Shaanxi Chiang Administration Commissioner's Office and the Second Logistics Department of the Chiang Army's 10th Division, 85th Brigade were stationed in the city. In the liberation of the city, all Chiang's troops and security regiments within the city were completely annihilated. In addition to those killed and wounded, over 1,400 people were captured alive, including Chiang's commissioner, the deputy head of the Shaanxi Security Third Regiment, and the deputy director of the Chiang Army Field Hospital. Dozens of machine guns, over 500 rifles, hundreds of thousands of bullets, four radio stations, and hundreds of mules and horses were seized. Detailed battle results are still being tallied.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 7th] The political offensive of the Northwest People's Liberation Army has had a significant impact on Chiang Hu's troops. Currently, the PLA is receiving deserters from Hu's army daily. A slogan "Six Deaths and Three Lifes for Chiang Hu's troops" (Note: The six deaths are "starving to death from lack of food, freezing to death from lack of shelter, dying of thirst from lack of water, dying from exhaustion carrying heavy loads, dying from dragging on mountain roads, and dying in the border regions for nothing"; the three lives are "deserting for a life, surrendering on the battlefield for a life, and joining the PLA for a life.") According to the Chiang Hu soldiers who have deserted, "This is most welcome because it speaks of the real situation and also points out the bright path for us." They also said, "We also welcome what you (referring to the PLA) wrote: 'Come to the liberated area, those who want to go home will be given travel expenses, and those who want to farm will be given land.' Because we were all conscripted into the army, we have no grievances or hatred towards the border regions." The large number of Chiang Hu soldiers laying down their weapons on the battlefield is also an important reason. For example, during the Qinghuabian battle, a PLA soldier was about to engage a Hu soldier with a bayonet when the enemy soldier quickly shouted, "Don't kill me, I have this." He then took out a PLA leaflet from his pocket and when asked where he got it, he said, "I picked it up on the Yan'an Road. We all secretly keep it, hoping to come over here." During the battle south of Wa'erbao, PLA soldier Zhao Wencheng found six or seven Chiang Hu artillerymen carrying a mortar in a ditch on the mountain and shouted, "Surrender! What are you still fighting for?" The enemy soldiers replied, "We don't have guns to surrender, let's surrender the cannon." They immediately put the cover on the cannon and sent it up the mountain.

### 进犯陕北胡军归路断绝  西北我军解放耀县  活捉蒋家大小喽罗千余

　　进犯陕北胡军归路断绝
    西北我军解放耀县
    活捉蒋家大小喽罗千余
    【新华社西北七日急电】距蟠龙大捷不出十二小时，西北人民解放军一部，又于五日上午十时，一举解放西安北不足二百里之耀县县城。该城有铁路、公路直达西安，扼陕北关中之交通要冲，为胡宗南后方之重要据点，陕西蒋记专员公署及蒋军第十师八十五旅第二后勤部均驻于该城。解放该城之役，城内所有蒋军及保安团队全部被歼，除毙伤外，生俘蒋记专员，陕保三团副团长，蒋军野战医院副院长等以下一千四百余人，缴获机枪数十挺，步枪五百余枝，子弹数十万发，电台四部，骡马数百匹，详细战果尚待清查。
    【新华社西北七日电】西北人民解放军之政治攻势，对蒋胡军发生极大作用，现解放军收容胡军逃兵日必数起。“蒋胡军六死三生”一标语（按：六死是“没吃的饿死，没住的冻死，没喝的渴死，背的重累死，走山路拖死，打边区送死”；三生是“开小差一生，战场上缴枪一生，到解放军来一生”。），据逃来的蒋胡军士兵供称：“这最受我们欢迎，因为说的都是实在情形，也替我们指出了光明大路”。他们又称：“你们（指解放军）写的“到解放区这边来，愿回家的发路费，愿种地的给地种。这我们也欢迎，因为我们都是抓来当兵的，同边区无冤无仇”。战场上蒋胡军放下武器者之多，这也是重要原因。如青化砭战斗时，人民解放军一战士正端着刺刀向一胡军士兵搏斗，该敌兵连忙高呼：“不要杀我，有这个”。随即从口袋中掏出人民解放军一张传单，问他是从那里得的，他说：“这是在延安路上拾的，我们都偷偷的保存起来，好过来哩”。瓦尔堡南战斗时，人民解放军战士赵文成在山上发现沟底有蒋胡军炮兵六七名扛着一门迫击炮便高喊：“缴枪吧，还打什么”？敌兵便回答道：“咱没枪缴，缴炮吧”。立即套上炮衣送上山去。（附图片）
