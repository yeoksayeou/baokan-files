Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th: Paris dispatch: Due to French Premier, Right-Wing Socialist, Ramadier's stubborn attitude on wage policies (an attitude welcomed by the French bourgeoisie and actively supported by the bourgeois party "Popular Republican Movement"), the French Communist ministers, after repeated but unsuccessful persuasion, resigned from the Ramadier government on the 4th. When the National Assembly held a vote of confidence on the 4th, the French Communist Party cast a vote of no confidence against Ramadier's policy of violating the interests of the working class. The French Communist Party's position was fully declared in the French Communist Party Central Committee's Letter to the People on May 3rd. The Letter to the People of the French Communist Party pointed out: "After the November 1946 election, there was a dissatisfaction among the French people, namely, that the democratic rules that the Communist Party should lead and organize the government according to the will of the people have been violated and obstructed. The Communist Party has always advocated lowering prices and supporting the government's policies in this regard. The Communist Party has decided to support the trade unions' demands for wage increases. It demands that the people should obtain food, clothing, and housing, demands the stability of the insurance franc, demands that the budget must be greatly reduced (especially the military budget) in order to achieve balance; demands the establishment of a just peace, and the right to reparations from the Ruhr; demands that the policy of external aggression must be stopped, because this policy is for the benefit of certain imperialists and harms the French Federation. For the well-being of the people, to ensure democratic freedom and independence, the Central Committee of the Party declares its will to make the policies that are in the interests of the French people triumph."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th: Paris dispatch: The strike wave caused by the French government's wage restriction policy has intensified, and the situation is very serious. The strike of workers at the Renault automobile factory demanding wage increases has persisted for two weeks. Workers at the Yuni automobile engine factory, taking consistent action with workers at the Renault factory, have decided to continue their strike. Steel workers in Saint-Étienne and Claus-Marty also broke out in large-scale strike movements last Saturday.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th: According to Agence France-Presse, Paris: As a result of the National Assembly's vote of confidence in the government on the 4th, the Ramadier cabinet was able to continue to maintain its position. The government's economic policy of restricting wages was the subject of intense debate in the parliament on the 4th. French Communist Party member Duclos declared: Although French production has increased, it has not improved the living conditions of workers. Duclos believes that production allowances and social adjudication regulations are needed nationwide because these are the legitimate demands of the working class.

　　反对拉马第反动政策
    法共部长退出内阁
    法国罢工浪潮日趋扩大
    【新华社陕北七日电】巴黎讯：由于法总理右冀社会党人拉马第在工资政策上采取顽固态度（这种态度受到法国资产阶级的欢迎，为资产阶级政党“人民共和运动”积极拥护），法共各部长在几经劝说无效之后，已于四日退出拉马第政府。四日当国民议会举行信任投票时，法共对拉马第违背工人阶级利益的政策投不信任票。法共的这种立场，在五月三日法共中央委员会告人民书中已宣示无遗。法共告人民书指出：“在一九四六年十一月选举之后，法国人民存在着一种不满，此即按照人民意志应由共产党人领导组织政府之民主规则受到破坏与阻碍。共产党一向是主张压低物价并支持政府在这方面之政策的，共产党决定支持工会的增资要求，它要求人民应获得衣食住，要求保险法郎之稳定，要求预算必须大大削减（特别是军事预算），以便作到平衡；要求建立公正之和平，及鲁尔赔偿之权利；要求对外侵略之政策必须停止，因为此种政策是为了某些帝国主义的利益，危害了法国联邦。为了人民的康乐，为了确保民主自由与独立，本党中央委员会宣布其意志为使适合法国人民利益之政策获得胜利。”
    【新华社陕北七日电】巴黎讯：由于法国政府限制工资政策而引起的罢工浪潮，已日趋扩大，情势甚为严重。雷诺汽车制造厂工人要求增资的罢工已坚持两周。雨尼汽车引擎制造厂工人与雷诺工厂工人采取一致行动，决定继续罢工。圣地齐及克劳斯马蒂两地钢铁工人于上星期六也爆发了大规模罢工运动。
    【新华社陕北六日电】据法国新闻社巴黎讯：国民议会四日举行对政府信任投票之结果，拉马第内阁得以继续维持。关于政府限制工资的经济政策，在四日之议会中曾展开激烈辩论。法共议员杜克洛宣称：法国目前生产品虽已增加，但并未使工人生活情况改善。杜氏认为生产津贴与社会裁判法规为全国所需，因为这是工人阶级的合法与求。
