　　【Report from this newspaper, Jilu豫, 24th】The marginal areas of Changyuan County are carrying out land reform while simultaneously monitoring the enemy. After the Eighth District of the county convened a district-wide activists' meeting and clarified the policy of fighting the enemy and dividing land simultaneously in the marginal areas, a vigorous land reform movement was launched in more than 50 villages, including Taipingzhuang, Xindian, Dongzhujiazhuang, Nanyangzhuang, Zhukou, Fan'ercai, and Heli Gao, from the 4th to the 10th, a period of seven days. After the distribution of the landlords' ill-gotten gains in each village, some villages turned to pursuing hidden wealth and planning land distribution. The broad masses have cast off the threats of the Kuomintang "Homecoming Legions" and other local bullies and landlords. The peasants participating in the struggle in each village account for more than 95% of the village's population. According to statistics from Hligao Village: of the village's 72 households, 62 participated in the struggle. When the Jiang's army occupied the area, the bad landlords in each village took the opportunity to seize food and firewood and killed our village cadres. The landlord of Taipingzhuang colluded with the enemy to bury our peasant association chairman, Yang Xinrong, and another person alive. After our army recovered the area, the democratic government arrested the main culprits, the evil landlords Wang Qingzao, Wang Kuini, and Zhang Saxun, and executed them by firing squad. Subsequently, two mass meetings were held in the village, and the masses' enthusiasm rose. They demanded that the landlords produce their hidden wealth on the spot. One day, while the masses were moving the landlords' furniture, the enemy suddenly launched a harassment attack, only two and a half miles away, but the masses continued to monitor the enemy while seizing the landlords' wealth. The enemy's gunfire had no impact, and the distribution took place alongside the struggle, and the mood was very high.

　　长垣边缘群众摆脱顾虑
  　大力进行土地改革
    【本报冀鲁豫二十四日电】长垣边缘区，一面监视敌人，一面进行土地改革。该县八区自召开了全区积极分子大会，明确了边缘区对敌斗争一手拿枪一手分田的方针后，从四号到十号七天当中，即在太平庄、新店、东朱家庄、南杨庄、朱口、范二砦、河里高等五十余村中，掀起热火朝天的土地改革运动，除将各村地主浮财分配完后，部分村庄即转入追浮财及计划分土地。广大群众摆脱了还乡团等恶霸地主的威胁，各村参加斗争的农民，占全村百分之九十五以上。据河高村的统计：全村七十二户，参加斗争者即达六十二户。该区在蒋军进占时，各村坏蛋地主曾乘机倒粮倒柴，杀害我村干部，太平庄的地主，勾结敌人把我们农会长杨心荣等二人活埋，我军收复后，民主政府即将主犯恶霸地主王清造、王魁妮、张萨训等三人逮捕，执行枪决，接连又在该村召开了二次群众大会，群众情绪高涨起来了，当场要求地主拿出浮财，一天群众正在搬运地主家具时，适值敌人出扰，仅距二里半地，但群众仍一面派民兵监视敌人，一面打浮财，敌人打枪毫没受影响，并随斗随分，情绪非常高涨。
