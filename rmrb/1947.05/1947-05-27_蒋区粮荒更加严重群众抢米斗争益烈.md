　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, May 25th: The Tianjin Yi Shi Bao reported from Shanghai: In addition to the grain robbing incidents that have occurred in Shanghai, Hangzhou, Wuxi, and Wuhu, mass grain robbing struggles have also occurred in Xuancheng and Hefei. Wuxi experienced continuous grain robbing on the 4th and 5th, with no rice shops spared. Dozens of grain robbing masses were wounded by Chiang's army and police, and two were killed. One rice shop clerk was also killed. When the masses robbed grain, they also surrounded the county government, shouting "Down with the corrupt official County Magistrate Xu," and paraded with the county government's signboard removed. In Hefei and Xuancheng, the masses robbed grain transport vehicles and boats. In Xuancheng, a rice boat in the river sank due to overcrowding. Ignoring the danger to their lives, the masses jumped into the water to salvage rice, with over 10,000 people gathering on the shore.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, May 22nd: According to a Guangzhou shipping report in a Shanghai newspaper last month: 100,000 farmers in Panyu, Guangdong, led by tenant farmers Liang Rui, Lin An, and others, sent a telegram protesting the Xingnong Company, controlled by the four families, for competing to cultivate approved fields and appealing for assistance. The reason is that last year, the Chiang party's Guangzhou headquarters sealed up the counter-revolutionary properties and fields left in the southern area of Panyu by the traitor Li Fugun and his henchmen, and handed them over to Jimin Hall for cultivation with a five-year approval. 100,000 farmers in Panyu depended on this for their livelihood. Recently, Jimin Hall transferred the management rights to the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Office of the Chiang-controlled Central Trust Bureau. Zhao Xiaoping, the director of the office, secretly re-approved these fields to the Xingnong Company of a certain commissioner of the office, changing the tenants. Since the original approval period has not expired and the spring plowing has already been sown this year, changing new tenants overnight will inevitably leave the spring plowing farmers in a desperate situation.

　　蒋区粮荒更加严重群众抢米斗争益烈
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】津益世报载沪息：除上海、杭州、无锡、芜湖迭发生抢米事件外，宣城、合肥亦有群众抢米斗争发生。无锡于四、五两日连续抢米，全城米行，无一幸免，抢米群众有数十人被蒋军团警击伤，二人被击毙，米行店伙一人亦被击毙。群众抢米时，并包围县府，高呼打倒贪官徐县长，将县政府招牌卸下游行。合肥、宣城群众抢夺运粮车船。宣城江中米船因人多被挤沉后，群众不顾性命跃入水中捞米，岸上聚集群众万余人。
    【新华社山东二十二日电】据沪报上月广州航讯：广东番禺十万农民，由佃农梁锐、林安等领衔发出快邮代电：抗议四大家族控制之兴农公司争耕批田，吁请援助。缘去年蒋党广州行营，曾将李逆辅群及其爪牙遗留在番禺南一带逆产田亩查封，交济民堂发耕订批五年，番禺十万农民均赖此生活，最近济民堂将管理权交蒋记中央信托局敌伪产业管理处办理，该处处长赵晓屏竟私自将此田亩改批与该处某专员之兴农公司，另换佃户。原批约既未满期，今年春耕又均已播耕。一日改易新佃，必致春耕农民陷于绝境。
