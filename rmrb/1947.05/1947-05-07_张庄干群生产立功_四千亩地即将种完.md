　　Zhangzhuang Cadres and Masses Achieve Merit in Production
    Four Thousand Mu of Land to be Soon Completely Sown
    [Our newspaper, Lucheng News] In Zhangzhuang Village, Fifth District, mutual aid teams initially failed to organize. After three or four days of discussion, cadres realized it was their own fault because they hadn't participated in mutual aid teams the previous year. The mutual aid teams lacked vigor, and issues like unpaid wages remained. They immediately made a self-criticism, saying, "Our leadership has great enthusiasm for liberation, but if production isn't improving, it must be because we haven't led well. As long as we get our hands dirty, there's no work we can't accomplish." After this self-criticism, the cadres divided their labor, went deep among the masses to find the reasons why mutual aid wasn't working, and discovered that the widespread existence of unpaid wages and other unresolved issues. They then settled the wages, rectified the mutual aid teams, and cadres participated in the teams themselves, so they quickly organized. Everyone continuously heard news of victories from various locations, and the cadres and masses were very excited. Village cadres proposed: The front lines are earning merit fighting Chiang Kai-shek, and we in the rear must also do a good job in production to earn merit. First, village chief Shi Fuyuan reported his plan, saying, "I will participate in a mutual aid team and also use my manpower and livestock to help teams with less labor." Farmers' Association Chairman Guo Zhenkuan said, "I am a military family member and don't need anyone's help. I will also make a pair of shoes to support the front lines." Worker Li Laosi said, "Hearing the news of victory is very inspiring. I will live on two days of food for three days of work." Teams spontaneously issued challenges to each other, and the village cadres even made four large banners. Whichever team completed spring plowing the fastest would be awarded the banner. In this upsurge, Kang Zhennü, a model military family member in her sixties, also said, "Our village is short of manpower this year, but I am not old when it comes to working. I will contribute a full labor force and don't need anyone's help. My land is already plowed, just waiting to be sown." Retired soldiers Zhao Rengui, Ping Xiufu, and others all said, "I don't need anyone's help either. I will do my own work and also help others." After the land reform movement and winter transport, the entire village newly acquired thirty-two head of livestock (the village has a total of forty plows), three hundred and thirty-three full and half laborers, and a total of more than fifty qing of land. Besides nine qing of wheat, there are still forty qing of autumn land. On average, each laborer in the village is planting seven mu of land. Now the grain land has all been plowed, and the potatoes and Golden Queen are all planted. Now we are hurrying to plant grain, and the entire village will be able to complete sowing around the tenth of this month. (Baobei)

　　张庄干群生产立功
    四千亩地即将种完
    【本报潞城讯】五区张庄村开始互助组组织不起来，经过三四天的讨论，干部发现是自己的毛病，因为去年没有参加互助组，互助组搞的没劲，并存有工资没清等问题。当即检讨说：“咱领导翻身劲头很大，现在生产搞不起来，一定是咱没领导好，只要咱亲自下手，就没有搞不起来的工作。”经过这样检讨，干部分工深入群众找原因，为啥互助不起来，发现普遍存在着工资未清等遗留问题，接着便清算工资，整顿互助组，干部分头参加小组，这样很快就都组织起来了。大家不断听到各地胜利消息，干部群众都很兴奋。村干部提出：前方立功打蒋介石，咱们后方也要搞好生产立功。首先由村长师福元报告他的计划，说：“我要参加互助组，还要将我的人畜力帮助劳力少的组。”农会主席郭真宽说：“我是军属，不用别人帮助，还要做一双鞋支援前线。”工人李老四说：“听到胜利消息很起劲，我要三日生活两日作。”组与组自动提出挑战，村干部并做大旗四幅，那组完成春耕最快奖给那组。在这一热潮中，引得六十余岁的模范军属康真女也说：“咱村今年人力缺，作起活来我并不老，我要顶全劳力，不用别人帮助。现在我的地都犁完了，只等下种了。”荣退军人赵仁贵、平秀福等都说：“我也不用别人帮助，做了自己的还要帮助别人。”经过翻身运动及去冬运输，全村新填牲口三十二头（全村共四十犋），男女全半劳力三百三十三人，共土地五十余顷，除小麦九顷，还有秋地四十余顷，全村每个劳力平均种地七亩。现在谷地都已犁完了，山药蛋及金皇后也都全部种上了，现正赶快种谷，本月十日左右，全村即可全部完成下种。（宝贝）
