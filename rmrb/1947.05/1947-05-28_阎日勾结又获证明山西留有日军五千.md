　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 23rd: Su Xiongxin (previously incorrectly reported as Lan Xionghao), the Upper Colonel Captain of the "Shanxi Security Fifth Grand Detachment" of the Japanese troops remaining in Shanxi who surrendered to the Jin-Cha-Ji People's Liberation Army in Shinao Mountain, Yangquan, confessed: His original name was Fujita Nobuo, from Furanoka, Japan. He came to China in 1937 and served as the Grand Captain of the 4th Independent Mixed Brigade of the former Japanese Shanxi Expeditionary Army. After the Japanese bandits surrendered, Iwata, the staff officer of his Shanxi Expeditionary Army Headquarters, signed a secret agreement with Yan, allowing them to retain their weapons and be renamed the "Shanxi Security Team," remaining in Shanxi and not being repatriated. Approximately 5,000 Japanese troops were preserved in this manner, organized into nine grand detachments, under the command of "Goumou Society," a joint Japanese-Yan special service organization established by Iwata and Yan, stationed in Taiyuan, Yuci, Datong, Xinzhou, Yangquan, and other places, responsible for guarding important cities and "suppressing the Communists." They were recently renamed the "Shanxi Field Army." Su avoided discussing the conspiracy of the "Goumou Society" to preserve Japanese troops and their belief in attempting to "restore the imperial throne," only stating that many officers and soldiers in the grand detachment did not want to fight and hoped to return to their country. When talking about this war, he said: The firepower and morale of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are both strong. If they did not surrender, they would inevitably be completely annihilated.
