　　Commander of the Second Rapid Column, Li Shou-cheng, Talks About
    The More Mechanized and Cumbersome the Chiang Army Is, the Easier It Is to Be Annihilated by the People's Liberation Army
    [Special Dispatch] After being sent to the rear of the liberated area, Li Shou-cheng, the brigade commander of the 49th Brigade of the Chiang Army, gradually recovered from his fatigue after a few days of rest, and his minor injuries on his right hand and right leg were gradually healed. On the 10th, when a senior staff officer from the military command visited him, he was already talking and laughing freely.
    When talking about the battle of Dahuying in Qixian County, Li complained a lot about the failure of the 36th Division and the 379th Regiment of the 47th Division to coordinate their operations. He praised the reasons for their annihilation in the Dahuying battle, saying: "Your attacking spirit is strong, your attacking techniques are excellent, your actions are rapid, and your command at all levels is flexible. In Dahuying, we had just entered the village when you entered the village, and street fighting immediately broke out."
    Li Shou-cheng explained the main weaknesses of the Chiang Army: "Our officers and soldiers have low morale and are unwilling to fight the civil war. After a period of peace last year, we had to continue fighting the civil war, and everyone felt extremely headache. The reason why we went to the front line to fight was entirely due to orders. At the same time, our troops are too cumbersome, our actions are not rapid, and we cannot move! Compared with the War of Resistance Against Japan, our troops are much more cumbersome, because we have added artillery and various vehicles. There are no roads for the vehicles to travel, so it is difficult to advance or retreat. Especially for heavy-duty vehicles, as long as the bridges are slightly worse, they have to be repaired; once they are repaired, it delays the time. Therefore, various vehicles look fast, but once they are on the battlefield and detached from the supply line, they are actually slow, and sometimes they become a burden." The commander of the Chiang Army's rapid column has such a view of his rapid column.
    The 49th Brigade suffered a large number of casualties in the Dahuying battle this time; when the battlefield was cleaned, a total of more than 1,000 bodies were buried. A senior staff officer then asked Li Shou-cheng: "Why did you have so many casualties in Dahuying? What caused the most casualties to you?" He replied: "Your artillery fire was fierce, and our troops were too dense; one of your shells would injure or kill dozens of us. Secondly, grenades caused us a lot of casualties."
    "What kind of strategies and tactics do you use against us?" When asked this question, Li Shou-cheng said without hesitation: "To deal with your pocket tactics, our plan is not to drill into it, and at the same time to knock out the two sides of your pocket opening to prevent you from locking the pocket opening. For your digging-the-heart tactics, we strengthen the guard of the command post, keep the command position secret, and maintain strict security; in addition, the non-combat personnel of the command post should be reduced as much as possible. To prevent your attacks, we build deep trenches and high fortresses. For your ambushes, we carry out extensive searches and long-distance reconnaissance."
    "You use this set of methods to deal with us, but why did you keep drilling into the pocket this time?"
    "We have suffered too much, it is impossible to defend against!" Li Shou-cheng said this sentence without confidence, and everyone, including Li Shou-cheng, laughed heartily. (Chang Deng)

　　第二快速纵队长李守正谈
    蒋军越机械化越笨重越容易被解放军消灭
    【本报特讯】蒋军四十九旅旅长李守正被送到解放区后方后，经过几天休息，疲惫逐渐消失，右手和右腿的轻伤亦渐治愈。十日，军区司令部某高级参谋人员去访问他时，他已谈笑自若了。
    一谈到淇县大胡营战斗，李氏非常埋怨三十六师和四十七师的三七九团没有协同作战。他对大胡营战斗他们被歼的原因赞叹的说：“你们攻击精神旺盛，攻击技术优良，动作迅速，各级指挥灵活。在大胡营，我们刚刚进村不久，你们就进村了，马上便发生了巷战。”
    李守正对蒋军的主要弱点加以说明道：“我们官兵士气不高，都不愿打内战。去年一度和平后，又要继续打内战，都感觉头痛极了。我们之所以开赴前线作战，那完全是命令关系。同时我们的部队太笨重了，动作不迅速，走不动！比起抗战时期来，我们的部队笨重多了，因为增加了炮兵和各种车辆，车辆一无道路可走，那就进退两难。尤其是载重车辆，只要桥梁稍微差一些，就得补修；一补修，就延误了时间。因此，各种车辆看起来是快的，但一到战场上一脱离了补给线实际上是慢的，有时还要成为累赘。”蒋军快速纵队的纵队长，对他的快速纵队就是这样的看法。
    四十九旅这次在大胡营战斗中，阵亡数字很大；打扫战场时，一共埋了一千多个尸体。某高级参谋人员乃问李守正：“在大胡营，你们为什么阵亡那样多？究竟是什么给你们杀伤最大？”他答道：“你们的炮火猛烈，我们的部队又太密集；你们一颗炮弹，就要伤亡我们几十个。其次是手榴弹给我们杀伤大。”
    “你们对我们采取那些战略战术？”当问到这个问题时，李守正毫不踌躇的说：“对付你们的袋形战法，我们的打算是不往里钻，同时打掉你们袋口的两侧，不让你们锁住袋口。对于你们的挖心战术，是加强指挥部的警卫力量，指挥位置保守秘密，同时警卫严密；此外指挥部的非战斗人员，要尽力减少。对于防止你们的袭击，就是深沟高垒。对于你们的伏击，就实行宽广的搜索和远距离的侦察。”
    “你们既用这一套办法来对付我们，可是这次为什么还要不断地往口袋里钻？”
    “吃亏太多了，防不胜防！”李守正毫无信心地说出这句话后，大家，连李守正在内，都哈哈笑开了。（常登）
