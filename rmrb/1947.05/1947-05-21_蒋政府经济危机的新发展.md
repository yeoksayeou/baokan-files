Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th.

Two weeks ago, we pointed out the deepening of Chiang Kai-shek's economic crisis. The facts of the past two weeks show that this economic crisis has developed more fiercely, making the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group even more helpless.

In the past two weeks, prices in the KMT-controlled areas, led by yarn prices, have been, in the words of Chiang's new Executive Yuan President Zhang Qun, "like a horse freed from its reins." According to the Associated Press: In Shanghai, from the 6th to the 7th of this month, within 24 hours, the price of high-quality rice soared from 300,000 yuan per picul to 360,000 yuan. The same rice was 60,000 yuan in January of this year, an increase of five times in four months. This is not only the case in Shanghai, but also in well-known rice-producing areas such as Wuhu, Anhui, and Nanchang, Jiangxi, where "prices have soared, and the situation is serious." (Central News Agency) And the price increase in Changchun "exceeds that of Peiping, Tianjin, Nanking and Shanghai." (Central News Agency)

This serious situation has forced the broad masses of the people to rise up to survive and has initiated a new high tide of the great people's struggle in the KMT-controlled areas. Since the large-scale parade against rising prices and against the monopoly of bureaucratic capital on May 4th, led by workers and students in Shanghai, "rice riots" and other economic struggles have not stopped, with strikes, class boycotts, and demonstrations occurring one after another. On the evening of the 9th of this month, the Shanghai KMT municipal government was surrounded by more than 8,000 workers and students. More than 2,000 bus and tram drivers in the British and French concessions went on strike and marched, and more than 15,000 textile workers demonstrated against Chiang Kai-shek's freezing of wages. Employees of the Shanghai Ministry of Communications Telecommunications Bureau and International Radio Station went on strike on the 10th, demanding increased compensation. Thousands of employees of Shanghai department stores marched and petitioned. On May 3rd, 500 employees of the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway held a strike, demanding increased wages.

In Nanjing, where Chiang Kai-shek himself is stationed, and Pukou on the opposite bank, thirteen rice shops were robbed on May 7th. All students at Central University went on strike, demanding improvement in living conditions. Central University professors invited reporters, demanding higher salaries. Even more than 400 "general-level officers" who had worked hard for Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule and then been abandoned, held a "weeping parade" due to difficult living conditions, marching in groups to Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum to weep, complaining that their situation was "worse than that of Japanese prisoners of war."

In addition, rice riots have also occurred in Wuxi, Nanchang, Chengdu and other places, and even bloody tragedies have occurred in which the police fired on starving people.

This overwhelming price surge has thrown the Chiang Kai-shek clique into a frenzy, and they have been unable to do anything about it for a month. Zhang Qun admitted that "price fluctuations make people feel uneasy;" Shanghai Mayor Wu Guozhen said: "Today, the wind is blowing everywhere, causing widespread unease in Shanghai." Director of the Information Bureau Dong Xian Guang said: "People's hearts are fluctuating, and the situation is serious." The Chiang government restricted news agencies in various places from publishing price news, and even the news headlines about prices had to "strive for caution."

Under this situation, the Chiang government's economic measures have been completely chaotic! Before this week, Zhang Qun said when he took office that he would follow Chiang Kai-shek's "Economic Emergency Measures Plan" announced in February; but after two weeks, he had to admit that this plan would not work, saying that "it was not a fundamental solution." But he also did not have any "fundamental" solutions. One of the more common measures taken by the Chiang governments in various places to deal with this grain crisis was "prohibition of transportation"; however, the result of the "prohibition of transportation" was a greater shortage of grain sources and higher grain prices, which benefited speculators even more. As a result, the Chiang "Central Government" had to shout loudly the day before yesterday that transportation could not be prohibited. In addition, Chengdu has decided to implement "negotiated prices," and Shanghai will have the Ministry of Food prepare 300,000 piculs of grain per month to be sold to workers and public education personnel at "official prices." But these are all methods that have long been proven to be bankrupt. Wu Guozhen announced five days ago that he would implement rationing in Shanghai, but on the same day, he announced its cancellation because "the situation is becoming increasingly dangerous"; on the 11th, Wu announced that he would implement it again, but it is still in the "paper stage." The Chiang Executive Yuan also passed on the 13th the granting of "living allowances" of 85 percent to public education personnel and military officers. Although this amount is far from solving the difficulties of the Chiang government's civil and military personnel, it will increase the Chiang government's financial burden by 3.6 trillion yuan per year, which accounts for half of the Chiang government's self-proclaimed annual income of 7.3 trillion yuan, so Zhang Qun admitted on the 9th that it was "too large to solve." In addition, the International Food Conference, manipulated by the United States, decided on the 9th to give Chiang more than 240,000 metric tons of grain. But based on past experience, this amount of grain is not only a drop in the bucket, but can only give China's bureaucratic capitalists the opportunity to make a fortune.

The Chiang government's real "emergency measure" to deal with the crisis is none other than suppression. Arrests and shootings have begun in Nanjing, Chengdu, Wuxi and other places. Shanghai Garrison Commander Xuan Tie Wu has also stated that the masses grabbing rice is "Communist hidden elements causing trouble" and he has made "necessary considerations." This ridiculous blame fully exposes the Chiang government's demise.

### 蒋政府经济危机的新发展

　　蒋政府经济危机的新发展
    两周以前，我们曾指出蒋介石经济危机深刻化。两周以来的事实，表明这个经济危机更加猛烈发展，更使蒋介石反动集团束手无策了。
    两周来蒋管区以纱价为领导的物价，照蒋府新行政院长张群的说法，是“如脱羁之马”。据美联社消息：本月六日至七日二十四小时内，上海的上等米由每石三十万元暴涨至三十六万元，本年一月同等米为六万元，四个月上涨了五倍。不仅上海一市如此，即著名出米地如安徽、芜湖、江西南昌等地，也都“物价暴涨，形势严重。”（中央社）而长春物价的上涨，“其速度超过平津京沪之上。”（中央社）
    这个严重情势，迫使广大人民奋起求生，并使蒋管区伟大的人民斗争开始了新的高潮。上海人民以工人、学生为骨干，于五月四日反物价上涨、反官僚资本垄断的大游行以来，“米骚动”及其他经济斗争没有停止过，罢工、罢课、游行示威，此起彼落。本月九日晚，上海蒋记市政府曾被八千余工人学生包围，英法租界公共汽车与电车司机二千余人罢工游行，一万五千余名纺织工人示威，反对蒋介石冻结工资；上海交通部电讯局及国际电台职工，于十日怠工，要求增加待遇；上海百货公司职工数千人游行请愿。五月三日，京沪铁路五百员工举行罢工，要求增加工资。
    在蒋介石自己坐镇的南京及其岸对的浦口，在五月七日也有十三家米店被抢。中央大学学生全体罢课，要求改善生活。中大教授则招待记者，要求提高待遇。甚至曾经为蒋介石反动统治出过死力又被遗弃的“将级军官”四百余名，因生活困难举行“痛哭游行”，结队至孙中山陵墓前痛哭，诉说他们的境遇“不如日本战俘”。
    此外无锡、南昌、成都等地也都发生抢米风潮，甚至发生了警察向饥饿的人民开枪的流血惨剧。
    这种排山倒海的物价狂潮，使得蒋介石集团手忙脚乱了，一个月来丝毫没有办法。张群承认“物价波动使人心惶惶不安”；上海市长吴国桢说：“今日打风遍地，造成全上海普遍不安。”新闻局局长董显光说：“人心波动，情形严重。”蒋政府在各地限制新闻界刊载物价消息，甚至关于物价的新闻标题，也要“力求审慎”。
    处于这种情势之下的蒋政府，其经济措施已经完全混乱了！这周以前，张群就职时还说要遵行蒋介石二月宣布的“经济紧急措施方案”；但是过了两周，就只得承认这个方案行不通，说“原非治本”。但是他也没有任何“治本”的方法。蒋记各地方政府对于这次粮食危机所采取较普遍的手段之一，是“禁运”；然而“禁运”的结果，是粮源更缺，粮价更高，投机者得利更大。以至蒋记“中央政府”不得不于前日大叫不能禁运。此外，在成都已决定实施“议价”，在上海则要粮食部每月备粮三十万石，以“官价”配售予工人及公教人员。但这些都是早已证明是破了产的办法。吴国桢在五日前宣布要在上海实行配售，当天就因“形势日益险恶”而宣布取消；十一日吴又宣布要实行，但至今仍处于“纸上阶段”。将府行政院十三日又通过给与公教人员及武职官员“生活补助费”百分之八十五，这个数目虽远不能解决蒋府文武人员的困难，但每年却须增加蒋府财政负担三万六千亿元，即占蒋府自称的全年收入七万三千亿元的一半，故张群在九日即承认为“为数过大，无法解决”。此外，美国操纵的国际粮食会议，九日决定以二十四万余公吨的粮食给蒋。但证以过去经验，这笔粮食不但是杯水车薪，而且只能给中国的官僚资本家以发财的机会。
    蒋政府对付危机的真正“紧急措施”不是别的，乃是镇压。南京、成都、无锡等地，已开始了拘捕、枪杀，上海警备司令宣铁吾，也已声明群众抢米是“共党暗藏分子捣乱”，他已作“必要考虑”。这种可笑的归罪，充分暴露了蒋政府的日暮途穷。（新华社陕北十九日电）
