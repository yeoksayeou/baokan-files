　　Yongxing No. 1 Printing Factory Strives for Perfection
    Further Improves Quality Standards
    Technical Skills of Workers at this Newspaper's Factory Greatly Improved
    [This Newspaper] Starting from April 21st, Yongxing Printing Factory No. 1 launched a "May First" Movement Week. All departments discussed higher quality standards. In the final discussion, the stereotyping department proposed "immediately recast any sand holes found after pouring the plate" as a standard. They also worked on flattening the platform (a method to eliminate uneven type, creating a method where, on already-made paper molds, lower characters are moistened with water and then deepened with type to make the lead plate even). Lead plates with slightly cut strokes, which were previously considered acceptable, are now recast. After completing their own plate repairs, they must carefully review everything again. The typesetting department selected older typefaces from the shelves and paid special attention to the aesthetics of the cover fonts. The characters engraved by worker Cheng are kept as samples for future inspection and research. After the typesetting department revises the final proof, they must proofread it again, and arrange the numbers of each book in advance to check themselves, overcoming the past problem of easily making mistakes in numbers. To eliminate blurry characters, it was proposed that "rotten characters are not allowed to be put on the shelf" when returning characters. According to the statistics from the proofreading department at the end of the month, the number of errors has been greatly reduced compared to October. Furthermore, errors in the original manuscript are researched by several people who consult reference books to make corrections. In addition, in terms of conservation, the stereotyping department experimented with using hemp pulp paper instead of imported rough-edged paper for paper molds, and it is now barely usable. Trainee Wang Gengwei baked twenty-four paper molds, using only eight sheets of waste paper that were previously considered unusable for baking plates (according to regulations, seventy-two sheets should have been used). After proofreading, someone cleans the calligraphy brush every day after work, with each brush exceeding two months of use. The kitchen democratically orders the menu, with a new variety of meals every day. The way vegetables are prepared does not repeat for a week, making everyone smile. The correspondent also works as a material handler, delivering lead plates four times a day, compared to two times before. The entire factory is working towards one goal – supporting the front lines. The focus for May is on improving quality in production, completing rush tasks ahead of schedule. In terms of learning, more emphasis is placed on current affairs education. The method is to have everyone raise questions for discussion, and then make a summary report, making it easier to get ideas across. Everyone is eager to show off their skills in the last month of this movement and see who can make the most contributions.

    [This Newspaper] Since the evaluation and assessment at the end of March, all the workers of this newspaper's printing plant have become more active and responsible in their work, and their technical skills have also greatly improved. The number of errors in the typesetting department's proofreading has been reduced to one to three per thousand, and the fastest plate assembly only takes an hour. Workers do not complain about temporary plate changes, but instead regard them as good opportunities to hone their skills. One night, the first edition had already been cast and was about to be delivered when important articles required an immediate plate change. The comrades in the typesetting department happily set the type immediately. Old worker Zhou Jingrong, who had already gone to sleep, also voluntarily got up to set the type. Cao Youlin assembled the plates alone, Li Yaotang did the titles, and Liu Qizhi, Fan Shoutian, and others proofread. Everyone worked until one o'clock at night to complete the task before resting. The engraving department can now produce more than a dozen typeset headlines every day, and also engraves maps. The stereotyping department works very quickly. Due to the increase in the number of newspapers, three sets of paper plates must be cast every day, and they can still be made deep and even, ensuring quality. Proofreading work has also improved compared to before, and the number of errors has been greatly reduced.

　　永兴一印厂精益求精
    更加提高质量标准
    本报工厂职工技术大有进步
    【本报讯】永兴印刷厂一厂从四月二十一日起，发动“五一”运动周，各部都讨论了更高的质量标准，打版部在最后一次的讨论中，把“浇版浇下的沙眼马上重浇”作为一个标准提出。并进行磨平台（消灭高低字的一种办法，创造了在已经打成的纸型上，再低字用水润湿，然后再用铅字把它打深，使铅版平匀。切了一点字划的铅版，在过去认为可以对付的，现在重浇，自己修完了版，还得细心的看过一遍。刻字部把架上的铅字，挑剔了旧的，特别注意封面字体的美观，成工刻出来的字也用一样本留下底，以便日后检查与研究。排字部改了最后一次签字样后，还得对一遍，把每本书的号码先摒起来，自己校对一下，克服了过去易错号码的毛病，为了消灭糊字，提出归字时“烂字不准上架”。校对科到月底统计，比十月份错字已大有减少，且对于原稿上的错字，都经过几个人的研究，翻参考书改正。此外在节约方面，打版部试验纸型不用外来毛边纸，而纯以麻头纸，现已勉强能用。练习生王庚维烘二十四张纸型，只用过去认为不能烤版用的废纸八张（照归定该用七十二张），校对后有人每天下工时把毛笔洗净，每支笔超过二个月的使用期。伙房里民主订饭单，每天吃一顿新花样，蔬菜做法一个星期不重复，吃得大家都眯眯笑。通讯员兼作材料员工作，送铅版从前一天走二次，现在能走四次。全厂为着一个目标——支援前线。五月份的重点，在生产上以提高质量为主，有突进任务要提前完；成在学习方面，更加重时事教育，方法是由大家提出问题讨论，最后作总结报告，这样易于打通思想。每个人都在磨拳擦掌，准备在这运动的最后一个月里显显身手，看谁立功多。
                                  （王华）
    【本报讯】本报印刷厂全体职工，自三月底评级鉴定后，对工作更加积极负责，技术也大有进步，排字部拣验稿错字减少到千分之一至千分之三，拼版最快的只要一点钟。工友们对临时动版，不但没发怨言，反而认为是锻炼技术的好机会。某夜第一版已经浇出要付即了，后有重要文章，要求立即换版，排字部同志们愉快的当即就排，老工友周景融已经睡了，也自动起床去排字，曹友林一人拼版，李耀堂做题目，刘棋枝、范守田等检稿，大家工作到夜一点完成任务后才休息。刻字部现在每天能按时刻出十几条出号字标题，而且还刻地图。打版部工作很快，由于报纸份数增加，每天得浇三付纸版，还能做到深匀，保证了质量。校对工作也较前提高，错字大大减少。
