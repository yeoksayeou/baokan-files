Model District Chief Pan Yongfu
    Liu Lin
    Comrade Pan Yongfu is from the Second District of Shimin County, Taiyue District. He was selected as a model village chief at the hero assembly in 1944, and transferred to district chief in 1945. Because of his peasant background, he possesses simple honesty, a down-to-earth attitude, and a dedicated spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly. Now he has been awarded the glorious title of Model District Chief of Taiyue District. Some of his exemplary deeds are worth learning from, so they are recorded below.

    Established Homes for Demobilized Veterans
    Seventeen demobilized veterans in Jiafeng Village, under the persuasion and education of Comrade Pan Yongfu, established their own organization and set up households. During the mass emancipation movement, the demobilized veterans actively participated in the struggle, and each was allocated some land. The relationship between the village cadres and the masses was greatly improved, and they actively responded to all calls within the village. Now fifteen demobilized veterans have married and have children, living happy and prosperous peasant family lives.

    Two demobilized veterans in Lizhuang requested that the 1.4 mu of garden land confiscated from a certain Li be distributed to them for cultivation, but the village cadres disagreed. When the district office learned of this, Comrade Pan Yongfu personally went to handle the matter.

    He went to the village, explained to the village cadres that it was an important responsibility of our government to find ways to provide for the livelihoods of demobilized veterans, and solved some problems in the village's work.

    The village cadres felt that what the district chief said was correct and examined themselves, saying, "We used to look down on these demobilized veterans. We must help them find land to settle down in the future." Comrade Pan Yongfu then introduced his experience in resettling demobilized veterans in Jiafeng Village to them. The village cadres of Lizhuang Village were greatly moved after listening.

    Taking the Lead, Organizing Production
    The production mutual aid work in Panzhuang, where the district office was located, was not well organized. In order to thoroughly understand the situation, Comrade Pan Yongfu personally participated in a mutual aid group at the north end of the village. He discovered that the main reason why this group had not been successful was that no one was taking the lead, resulting in a free-for-all. He discussed this with everyone, formulated solutions, and took the lead in implementing them. Under his promotion and influence, this mutual aid group quickly became active. He seized the experience of this group and quickly spread it to other production mutual aid groups.

    A few days later, he also carried a large clock down from the temple and placed it in a suitable location in the village. He got up early every day to strike the clock, waking everyone up early to carry out production. This continued for more than a month, and the masses developed the habit of getting up early to carry out production. He also organized some surplus and semi-able-bodied laborers in Panzhuang, leading everyone to plant two mu of indigo, harvesting 240 jin, planting ten mu of sesame, harvesting eight shi, opening up seven mu of wasteland for planting grain, harvesting seven shi, and also planting some hemp.

    The production work led by Comrade Pan Yongfu in Jiafeng Village not only organized agricultural production mutual aid very well, but also organized more than 70 percent of the local masses and more than a dozen immigrant households into dyeing workshops, oil mills, carpentry shops, blacksmith shops, paper mills and other cooperatives. In the past six months, the five万元 shares yielded a net profit of more than eleven万元.

    Resolutely and Thoroughly Leading Mass Movements
    During the land reform movement, the masses wanted to struggle against Shang Julong, but because three district cadres had good relations with Shang Julong, they dared not fight, so they asked District Chief Pan. Comrade Pan Yongfu directly told them, "Go ahead and fight, don't be afraid." The masses were still somewhat worried and asked, "What about the things that certain cadres have stored with him?" He resolutely replied, "You can do whatever you want." A few days later, a certain cadre wrote to Comrade Pan Yongfu, saying, "There are more than ten shi of wheat and more than two shi of rice stored at Shang Julong's house. Please take care of it." He immediately replied with a letter: "The masses have already distributed this grain. Go ask Shang Julong for it." Therefore, under his leadership, the mass movement quickly and widely developed in depth.

　　模范区长潘永福
    刘林
    潘永福同志是太岳区士敏县二区人，一九四四年的群英大会上被选为模范村长，四五年调任区长，由于他出身农民，具有朴素老实，脚踏实地，兢兢业业全心全意为人民服务的高尚品质，今已荣膺太岳区模范区长的光荣称号。他的一些模范事迹，值得大家来向他学习，因此把它记述在下面。
    为劳退军人建立了家务
    贾峰村的十七位荣退军人，在潘永福同志的说服教育下，成立了自己的组织并建立了家务；在群众翻身运动中，荣退军人同志都积极地参加斗争，每人都分得了一些土地；对村干部与群众的关系，不但大大地改善了，而且对村内的一切号召，他们都能踊跃响应；今已有十五位荣退军人同志结了婚并有了孩子，过着美满富裕的农民家庭生活。
    李庄的二位荣退军人，要求把斗出李某的一亩四分园地，分给他们种，村干部不同意，区公所知道了这件事，潘永福同志便亲自去处理这个问题。
    他到了村上，把设法替荣退军人谋生活是我们政府的一项重要责任的道理讲给村干部听，并解决了村里工作上的一些问题。
    村干部觉得区长说的话很对，便自已检讨说：“咱们过去就看不起这些荣退军人，今后一定要帮助俺们找地安家”。潘永福同志接着就把他在贾峰村安置荣退军人的经验介绍给他们，李庄村干部听了后受到很大的感动。
    自己带头，组织生产
    区公所驻在地——潘庄，生产互助工作搞的不好，潘永福同志为了彻底了解情况，便亲身参加到庄北头的一个互助组。他发现了这个组没有搞起来的主要原因是没人带头，形成自流，他就和大家讨论，订出办法，自己先去执行，事事做在别人的前面，在他的推动与影响下，这个互助组很快就活跃了起来。他就抓紧这个组的经验，很快把它传播到其他的生产互助组里去。
    过了几天，他又在庙上抬下来一口大钟，放在村子适中的地方，他每天早起打钟，唤醒每个人早早起来进行生产，这样继续了有一个多月，群众就有了早起进行生产的习惯。他又把潘庄的一些剩余及半劳动力组织起来，领导大家种蓝二亩，收＠二四○斤，种芝麻十亩，收八石，开荒种谷七亩，收粮七石，又种了一些麻。    潘永福同志所领导的贾峰村的生产工作，不但很好地组织了农业生产互助，而且把该村百分之七十以上的本村群众及外来的十多户移民都组织到染房、油房、木匠铺、打铁炉、纸坊等合作社里去，去年半年，五万元的股金就得净利十一万多元。
    坚决彻底，领导群运
    土地改革运动中，群众要斗争商聚隆，因有三个区干部和商聚隆关系很好，不敢斗，就去问潘区长，潘永福同志直接了当地对他们说：“你们斗吧，不要怕。”群众总还是有些顾虑，又问：“某某干部在他那里存的一些东西怎么办？”他坚决地回答：“你们愿意怎么办，就怎么办”。过了几天某某干部给潘永福同志来信说：“商聚隆家存有我的十多石麦子，两石多米，请照顾”。他马上回了一信：“群众已将这些粮食分了，你向商聚隆要吧。“因此在他的领导下，群众运动就很快普遍深入的发展起来了。
