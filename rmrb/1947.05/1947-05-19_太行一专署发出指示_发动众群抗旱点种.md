　　Taihang First Administrative Region Issues Instructions
    Mobilize the Masses to Fight Drought and Sow Seeds
    [This newspaper, Taihang News] The First Administrative Region issued instructions to launch a mass campaign to fight drought by carrying water to plant seeds: "Sow flowers and plant beans around Grain Rain." Grain Rain has now passed, and the Start of Summer is approaching, but the drought is preventing sowing. We must carry forward the long-standing method of carrying water to plant seeds to fight nature and ensure the successful completion of the requirement to plant cotton on one-tenth of the land. We should also try to sow other crops such as sorghum, beans, melons, and vegetables as early as possible. Areas where water can be carried to plant seeds should seize the opportunity to make concentrated efforts, especially for cotton planting.
    Carrying water to plant seeds is a major undertaking to fight against nature. Our county and district cadres must understand the thinking of the masses, personally help them plant seeds, and organize mutual aid and collective efforts, while also taking care of military dependents and orphans without labor. To turn carrying water to plant seeds into a movement, we must launch a campaign to establish merit, first commending and rewarding those who take the lead, and promptly commend and reward them at any time to seize the opportune moment. All localities should establish banners for the movement. Now the counties have begun to move. Xingtai and Shahe have held mobilization meetings. Tongyi Village in Xingtai has completed carrying water to plant seeds. The Zanhuang District cadres personally supervise, and County Chief Lü of Neiqiu leads all cadres to personally plant cotton, promoting the immediate formation of a planting movement among the masses.

　　太行一专署发出指示
    发动众群抗旱点种
    【本报太行讯】一专署为开展抗旱斗争发动群众担水点种发出指示：“谷雨前后撒花点豆”，现在谷雨已过，不久就要立夏，但天旱无雨不好下种，撒花点豆又不能错过节令。这就需要我们发扬历年来艰苦的担水点种办法与天作斗争，保证十分之一的土地种棉花要求顺利完成。其他如高粱、豆子、瓜、菜等能趁垧早种要尽量争取下种，能担水点种的地区要尽量突击，尤其棉花下种更应抓紧。
    担水点种是与天作斗争的大事，我们县区干部必须了解群众思想，亲自下手帮助群众点种，更应组织互助集体进行，同时照顾无劳力的军属与孤寡。为使担水点种形成运动，要展开立功运动，首先表扬与奖励带头者，应及时抓住火候随时表扬与奖励，各地均应树立运动的旗帜。现在各县已动起来，邢台、沙河在大会上进行了动员，邢台同仪村担水点种已完成，赞皇区干部亲自督促，内邱吕县长带全体干部亲自动手点种棉花，推动群众立即形成点种运动。（兰阁）
