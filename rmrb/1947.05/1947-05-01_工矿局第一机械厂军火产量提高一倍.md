　　工矿局第一机械厂军火产量提高一倍
    【本报讯】边区工矿局第一机械厂赶造军火支援前线自卫反击，最近八天产量提高一倍。该厂一个月来已改造或修理好平射炮××门及轻重机枪××挺分送各自卫前线，据反映效果均佳。三月十四号全厂职工于学习“预言变成了喜讯”社论时，一致兴奋地喊出：“这光荣我们也有份呀！我们一定要供给前线更多的优良武器！”大家纷纷订出了“五一”以前的竞赛增产计划。从此大家便增加工作时间，在技术上的钻研精神也大大提高了。开始每斤焦炭化铁二斤半，经申明然等同志研究增为五斤。高士才等同志创造新的刨刀，竟使刨床功效提高达五倍之多。张志坚同志开始三天旋一个炮尾，现成为十三小时旋一个炮尾；钳工傅庆保及装配等部均提高工率一倍以上。至四月十八号止，全厂产量，比三月分提高百分之四十九；特别是最近八天竟较以往平均产量提高百分之百！该厂宋监理谈：成绩获得的原因：除过职工在时事教育中思想觉悟提高与改良技术外，科学的分工和工作岗位固定是主要环节。并特别注意了以钳工做主体，把烘炉、元车、钳工、装配等一一排列，使之密切衔接，这样互相配合、督促、检查，提高上均收效极大。（冰）
