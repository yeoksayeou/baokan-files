Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 6th—Among the hundreds of captured Chiang Kai-shek army officers in the POW reception center, all uniformly dressed in American-style military uniforms, one man stood out wearing a black peasant's short jacket. This was Xu Shichang, an ordinary soldier from the 31st Brigade of the Hu army, assigned to a particularly unpleasant task. At the very beginning of this offensive against the Border Region, he was assigned to be a "vanguard," driving a dozen or so oxen to tread on landmines. This tactic, learned by Chiang Hu's army from their Japanese devil teachers, was first tried out on him because he was from northern Shaanxi, making it easier for him to disguise himself as a peasant.

He was from Dahuo Store, the closest place to the Border Region, so poor that he had no land or wife, living with his older brother. In the spring of the 31st year of the Republic [1942], he was conscripted. After the Japanese surrender, he thought he could finally go home, but it was not allowed, and he was assigned to the 31st Division, later reorganized into the 31st Brigade, and sent to Shanxi to fight the Eighth Route Army. In the Wenxi area, they were almost completely wiped out. He wanted to escape, but Hu Zongnan controlled the mouth of the Yellow River, preventing him from crossing.

This time he got across, but he was forced to wear civilian clothes and charge through landmines. Upon entering Linzhen, landmines exploded everywhere. Dazed and confused, he arrived at Qinghuabian, shouted for a while, and then surrendered his weapons. At that time, he and five others were hiding in a cave. He was the first to surrender and helped the Liberation Army confiscate five guns. After arriving at the officer reception center, he learned that his hometown of Dahuo Store had long been liberated and heard that his older brother had also come to this side. He said, "This is finally like coming home. My family will also participate in the land reform. Who doesn't have a conscience? I want to go to the company to work, the sooner the better, and do something for us poor people."

　　“踏雷先锋”徐世昌梦想不到就回了家
    【新华社西北六日电】在被俘蒋军军官招待处里，几百穿着清一色美式军服的蒋军军官中，有一个人例外的穿着黑色的老百姓短褂，这是胡军三十一旅里一个受着特别差使的普通士兵，他的名子叫徐世昌。在这次进攻边区一开始，他就被派做在前面赶着十来个牛踏地雷的“先锋”。这是蒋胡军从日本鬼子老师那里学来的这一套战术，首先就选上他来试一试。因为他是陕北人，便于伪装老百姓。
    他是靠边区最近的打火店人，穷得没地也没有老婆，跟哥哥一块过。三十一年春上，被拉了壮丁，日本投降后，以为总可以回家了，结果不准又被编到了三十一师，后来整编成三十一旅，开到山西打八路军。在闻喜一带差不多全部垮台了，他想逃走，但胡宗南把着黄河口过不来。
    这次可过来了，但他却被迫穿上便衣冲地雷。一进临镇地雷到处响，昏头昏脑地到了青化砭，呼喊一阵就缴械了。当时他和五个人躲在一个窑洞里，他首先投降，并帮着解放军缴了五支枪。到军官招待处后，才知到家乡打火店早经解放，听说他哥哥也到了这边。他说：“这才算到家了，我的家也要闹土地了。人谁没有良心呢？我想到连队去工作，越快越好，给咱穷人干点事”。
