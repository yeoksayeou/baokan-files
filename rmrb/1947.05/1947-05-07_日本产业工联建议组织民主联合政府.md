Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd. Reports from various sources: Following the Diet elections in Japan, the formation of a new government and the selection of a new Prime Minister are currently under consideration. As with the Diet elections, a struggle is unfolding between progressive forces and reactionaries on this issue. A spokesperson for the All-Japan Congress of Industrial Unions stated on the 29th that the union suggests forming a coalition government composed of the Social Democratic Party, the Communist Party, the People's Cooperative Party, other small parties, and some progressive elements within the Democratic Party. A spokesperson for the Japanese Federation of Labor also stated on the same day that voters have authorized the Social Democratic Party to form a government, as they received the most votes; if the Social Democratic Party makes concessions to conservatives, it will inevitably harm the position of labor. Tokuda Kyuichi, Secretary-General of the Japanese Communist Party, and Miki Takeo, spokesperson for the People's Cooperative Party, both issued statements advocating that the position of new Prime Minister be held by the Social Democratic Party. Miki stated that this would be respecting the will of the voters. Over the past few days, many Japanese newspapers have also believed that a coalition government should be formed by a leader from the Social Democratic Party. The Social Democratic Party itself has also expressed its position; Secretary-General Suehiro Nishio (a right-wing leader of the party) stated on the 30th: "Under no circumstances will the Social Democratic Party participate in a cabinet headed by conservatives." It is understood that Nishio's statement was supported by the left wing of the party. On the side of the reactionary parties, they also advocate a so-called "coalition government." Hitoshi Ashida and Takao Saito, leaders of the Democratic Party, advocate the Social Democratic Party, the Democratic Party, and the Liberal Party forming a government together, i.e., a so-called "three-party coalition government." They also insist that a conservative be the Prime Minister. On the Liberal Party's side, opinions are quite uncertain and inconsistent. Finance Minister Tanzan Ishibashi expressed approval of a "three-party coalition government," while Secretary-General Banboku Oono of the party demanded a "purely conservative government." Oono's "pipe dream" is difficult to realize; not only is it not permitted by public opinion, but the Democratic Party also does not buy it. Takao Saito, Chairman of the Supreme Committee of the Democratic Party, scolded the Liberal Party on the 29th, saying that the leaders of the party were "merely a bunch of old party hacks." Saito's scolding exposed the resurgence of the contradictions between the two reactionary parties in the government over the struggle for power.

　　日本产业工联建议组织民主联合政府
    【新华社陕北三日电】各方报导：国会选举以后的日本，刻正酝酿新政府的组织与新首相的人选问题。和国会选举的情形一样，进步力量与反动之间在这一问题上展开了斗争。全日本产业工会联合会发言人于二十九日声称：该会建议组织社会民主党、共产党、国民协同党各小党派及民主党中若干进步分子的联合政府。日本劳工总同盟之发言人亦于同日声称：选民已授权社会民主党组织政府，他们使它获票最多，社民党若向保守分子让步，则必将损害劳工的地位。日共总书记德田球一与国民协同党发言人三木武夫均发表声明，主张新首相一职由社会民主党担任。三木称：这样才是尊重投票人的意志。过去数日，很多日本报纸亦均认为联合政府应由社民党领袖出而组织之。社民党本身也表示了态度，该党书记长西尾末广（该党右派领袖）三十日称：“社民党在任何情形下，决不参加以保守分子为首之内阁。”据悉：西尾的这一声明受到该党左派的支持。在反动党派方面，他们也主张所谓“联合政府”。民主党首领芦田均、斋藤隆夫等主张社民党、民主党、自由党合组政府，即所谓“三党联合政府”。他们并坚持以保守分子为首相。在自由党方面，意见则颇不确定，亦不一致。藏相石桥湛三表示赞成“三党联合政府”，而该党书记长大野伴睦，则要求“清一色的保守政府”。大野的这种“美梦”，是很难实现的；不仅民意不许可，而且民主党也不买他的账。民主党最高委员会的主席斋藤隆夫二十九日就曾大骂自由党一顿，说该党的领袖们“仅为一群老党棍而已”。斋藤的骂，暴露了两个反动党派在政府中争夺权位矛盾的复发。
