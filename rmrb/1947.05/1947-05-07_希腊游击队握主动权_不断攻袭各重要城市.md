Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, May 5th: TASS, Athens dispatch: The Greek government forces continue to fight against the Greek guerrillas. In the past two weeks, guerrilla activity has increased significantly. In late April, guerrillas attacked the suburbs of Volos, where the Greek Army Group headquarters in charge of the anti-guerrilla operations was located. During the same period, guerrillas captured the city of Ineti, seizing a large amount of military equipment. It is reported that when the guerrillas attacked the Chania Airport on Crete, they encountered government troops and the gendarmerie for the first time. Several reporters from Crete reported that the guerrillas' ability to attack Chania, the administrative center of the island, was unexpected by the government. Government newspapers no longer report on the "encirclement" of the guerrillas. The rhetoric of "completely annihilating the guerrillas in two or three weeks" has also disappeared. On April 25, Mr. Astartas, a monarchist member of parliament from the "New Party," stated in the parliament that the initiative in various places is almost entirely in the hands of the guerrillas. The current situation is even more serious than in January, and the guerrillas continue to control vast areas of Greece.

　　希腊游击队握主动权
    不断攻袭各重要城市
    【新华社陕北五日电】塔斯社雅典讯：希腊政府军继续对希游击队作战。过去两周，游击队活动有显著增加。四月下旬，游击队袭入指挥对游击队作战的希腊集团军总部所在地倭罗城郊。同一时期，游击队攻克依内提城，缴获大批的军事装备。据报载，游击队出击克里特岛干尼亚机场时，与政府部队及宪兵队发生首次遭遇战。克里特岛数记者报导，游击队能出击该岛行政中心干尼亚，出乎政府意料之外。政府报纸不再报导对游击队的“包围”。“两三周间全部歼灭游击队”的论调亦已阒然无闻。“新党”的君主主义议员阿士塔斯四月二十五日在国会中发言称：各地主动权几乎均为游击队掌握。目前局势较之一月份尤为严重，游击队继续控制希腊广大地区。
