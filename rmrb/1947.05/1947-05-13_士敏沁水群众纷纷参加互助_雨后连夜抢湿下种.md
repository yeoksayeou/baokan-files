[Report from our Taiyue office on the 11th] After the rain on the 1st of this month, the masses in Shimin and Qinshui urgently seized the time to sow seeds. The Shimin County Government also issued instructions, which stated: (1) Except for war-related tasks, all public service duties will be suspended for one month starting from the 5th of this month to focus on sowing seeds. (2) Implement large-scale labor exchange between groups and villages, with one village helping another after finishing its own sowing. (3) Prioritize sowing the land of military personnel, cadres, and martyrs' families before sowing one's own land. (4) All schools will be closed for ten days to help the masses sow seeds. To implement these instructions, most county and district cadres personally went to the countryside to lead. The masses and teachers and students of various primary schools in the Second District proposed the slogan of learning from the rapid spirit of the frontline troops in battle to send seeds into the soil. The teachers and students of the Fifth Normal School organized twelve mutual aid groups, going to Wuan, Jiafeng, Lizhuang, Yong'an and other villages to help the masses sow seeds. Old men and women such as Kong Shunxing, Kong Fanxin, and Zhang Hongde in Lizhuang, who never participated in mutual aid before, also joined the mutual aid group; Wang Shouxin, over fifty years old in Yinzhuang, led a preferential treatment to military family mutual aid group to rush to sow seeds late at night; Yang Jiulin's children's mutual aid group in Liuzhuang village planted ten mu of cotton in two days. District Chief Pan Yongfu and his assistant personally participated in the labor of the Panzhuang mutual aid group, taking the lead in rushing to sow seeds; all the women in Wuan village completely stopped spinning and rushed to plant cotton. According to incomplete statistics, fifteen administrative villages, including Panzhuang in the Second District, have sown more than 9,000 mu of cotton, 2,242 mu of millet and other miscellaneous grains in the four days after the rain. After the rain, Jiazhai Village in the First District has sown all 1,214 mu of land in the whole village. Wangbi Village in the Sixth District rushed to sow seeds after the rain, organizing more than 80% of the entire village's men and women labor force and half labor force, sowing 386 mu in three days, saving 210 labor days compared with previous years. After the rain, a mutual aid group in Changzhen Village in the Fifth District has completed sowing all 332 mu of land and helped other groups to rush to sow seeds. During this rush to sow seeds, all villages first plowed and sowed for military personnel, cadres, martyrs' families, and retired military personnel. The land of the twelve military cadres and martyrs' families and the fifteen participating militia and civilian husbands in Lizhuang, and the land of the eleven civilian husbands' families in Panzhuang, were all planted on the third day after the rain. The masses in Qinshui are also rushing to sow seeds after the rain; in order to rush to sow seeds, the mutual aid brigade in Hanzheng Village temporarily changed its organization, dividing it into four groups according to the strength of individual skills and physical strength: a plowing group of nine people, a sowing group of six people, and a miscellaneous work group of eight people, all advancing at the same time, sowing 143 mu of millet, 33 mu of hemp, and 25 mu of cotton in three days.
