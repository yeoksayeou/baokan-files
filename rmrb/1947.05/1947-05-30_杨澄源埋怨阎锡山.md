Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 28th: Yang Chengyuan, the former Commander-in-Chief of the Jin-Northwest Region of Yan Xishan's army with the rank of General, who was captured by the People's Liberation Army in Xi County five months ago, is currently resting in a small village with beautiful scenery in the Jin-Northwest Liberated Area. He is sixty years old. When he was loyal to Yan Xishan, his leg was crippled due to wading through cold water. He often walks along the stream with a cane, or puts on his glasses and reads newspapers with a magnifying glass. He also frequently dictates, and his chief of staff, Hu Fangzhen, who was captured with him, takes notes on his behalf. These notes have reached five or six volumes, recounting the facts of how Yan Xishan has wronged him over the past thirty years, as well as Yan's crimes in ruling Shanxi. The notes also frequently involve the current situation, marveling at the high morale of the People's Liberation Army. After the Battle of Linyi, he asserted that the People's Liberation Army would surely win.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 28th: The Jin Sui Democratic National Construction Officers' Group, composed of Yan's army officers and generals who have laid down their weapons, recently sent a telegram to all the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army in the liberated areas, congratulating them and paying their respects. They also issued a circular telegram to the whole country, explaining the inevitable victory of the People's Liberation Army, calling on the Jiang-Yan armies to awaken as soon as possible, not to die for dictators and traitors, and to support the people's war with anti-war and cease-fire actions.

　　杨澄源埋怨阎锡山
    【新华社晋绥廿八日电】五个月前，在隰县被人民解放军俘虏的阎军晋西北地区上将总指挥杨澄源，现住在晋西北解放区一风景颇佳的小村休息。彼年已六十，为阎锡山效忠时，因寒冷涉水，腿已残废，常扶杖在身边沿溪散步，或戴上眼镜再拿上放大镜读书报，且经常由他口授，由和他一直被俘的他的参谋长胡芳珍代笔写笔记。此种笔记已达五六册，历述三十年来阎锡山对不起他的事实，及阎统治山西的罪恶。笔记中亦常涉及目前时局，惊叹于人民解放军士气之旺。临沂战役后，彼即断言人民解放军必胜。
    【新华社晋绥廿八日电】放下武器的阎军将校所组成之晋绥民主建国军官团，顷致电各解放区全体解放军将士祝捷致敬，并向全国发出通电，说明人民解放军必胜形势，呼吁蒋阎军早日觉醒，勿为独夫卖国贼送死，以反战罢战行动来支援人民战争。
