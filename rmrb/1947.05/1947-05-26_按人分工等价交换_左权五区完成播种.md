Division of Labor Based on Person, Equivalent Exchange
　　Zuoquan Fifth District Completes Sowing
　　[This newspaper's Zuoquan dispatch] The spring plowing and sowing in the Fifth District started on April 18th and lasted for 23 days until May 11th. Out of the more than 38,000 mu of land in the district, except for about 1,400 mu in three villages including Quanquan that have not yet been sown, the rest has been completely sown. The methods are: 1. Within each team, specific division of labor was carried out according to each person's strengths. For example, villages such as Shuipo organized plowing teams, furrowing and embankment repairing teams, and grain sowing teams. After the plowing was done, the furrowing team immediately came to furrow, and then the sowing was done. In most villages, people pulled seed drills to sow the land plots adjacent to each other within the teams, which not only reduced walking time but also saved time compared to one person plowing and one person furrowing. 2. In terms of participation organization, in order to take care of the difficulties of each team's manpower and livestock, they were divided into three batches according to the amount of labor and livestock. After the first batch left, the second batch prepared, so that everyone would not be flustered, or if one team all left, they could not sow. Participation in the war was divided and the mutual aid teams were divided into unified equivalent exchange. 3. After mass discussion, a fairer method of equivalent conversion was determined, and the enthusiasm of each person was improved by methods such as "dead scores and live evaluations" (i.e., combining fixed quotas with flexible evaluation) and rewards. 4. The groups used spare time to conduct discussions anytime and anywhere to resolve ideological obstacles and formulate plans for each household, group, team, and village to cultivate the remaining land, clarify the direction of struggle, organize water carrying and point sowing, overcome the difficulties of livestock power, and carry out unified regulation of labor and livestock power between villages. 5. All forces were mobilized and organized, and cooperatives, stores, students, and workers made all-out efforts to rush the sowing, first sowing for military families and war participants to stabilize their emotions. Villages, teams, groups, and individuals all put forward competitions. With the all-out efforts of men, women, old and young, the sowing was completed in 23 days. Now, each village is organizing transportation and firewood gathering to prepare for topdressing. At the same time, each group is conducting organizational consolidation combined with ideological education, settling mutual aid accounts, and preparing for weeding.

　　[This newspaper's Zuoquan dispatch] The Shuyu Joint Defense Area in the Fourth District organized all and semi-labor forces, clarified the division of labor, and rushed to sow. Before May 12th, 5,309 mu of the 6,602.75 mu of land in the entire Joint Defense Area had been sown. In the use of semi-labor, children and women were used to furrow the edges of the fields, search for roots, pick up stones, lead livestock, drip seeds, and spread manure; full laborers carried manure, plowed, and furrowed. Now there are no idle people in each village. Zhao Qingrong from Dalinkouer Village and his sister carried manure together to plant pumpkins. Women Cao Erguo, Li Aifeng, and Dong Yu carried water every day. Under her influence, the women in the whole village no longer used full laborers to carry water. Zhao Lancui, a 42-year-old woman, personally carried manure to plant pumpkins. The whole Joint Defense Area has finished sowing millet, and in another seven days, it can be guaranteed to complete all sowing.

　　按人分工等价交换
  　左权五区完成播种
    【本报左权讯】五区春耕下种自四月十八日开始至五月十一日二十三天时间，全区三万八千余亩土地除芹泉等三村尚有一千四百余亩未下种外，其余已全部种完。办法是：１、各组队内根据各人所长，进行了具体分工，如水坡等村组织有犁地组，刨边修堰组，种谷组，这样先犁过去，马上有刨边组就来刨了，再来下种，各村大部都是人拉耧，把各队内的地挨住地块下种，既减少走路时间，又比一人犁地一人刨边省出时间。２、在参战组织上，为了照顾各组队人畜力困难，都按劳畜力多少，分为三批，一批走后二批准备，不至人人慌张，或一组全部走了不能下种，参战分与互助组分统一等价交换。３、经群众讨论定出了更公道的等价折分办法，并以死分活评奖励等办法提高了每人积极性。４、以组随时随地抽空子进行讨论，解决思想障碍，及订各户、组、队、村耕余计划，明确奋斗方向，组织了担水点种、人拉犁，克服了畜力困难，并进行了村与村劳畜力统一调剂。５、动员组织了所有力量，合作社、商店、学生、工人全力突击，先给军属及参战人员下种，安定他们情绪。村、队、组、人都提出了竞赛，这样男女老少全力突击下，二十三天时间全部完成下种。现各村正组织运输、打柴，准备追肥，同时各组进行整理结合思想教育，结算互助账目，准备锄苗。
