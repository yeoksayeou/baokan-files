　　Agricultural Technology Guidance Experience in Beiliu Village
　　The Technology Committee of Beiliu Village in Licheng achieved results last year. After rectification, the organization is more complete, and technology guidance will play a greater role. According to the experience of Beiliu Village, the first thing to do is to strengthen the organization and leadership of the village's Technology Committee. The organization of the village Technology Committee should include the following types of people: First, absorb experienced old farmers (i.e., technical experts with specialties) to participate, because they have rich experience and excellent techniques in agriculture. After their research, the technology can be disseminated in a timely manner. Second, some cadres and production team leaders or group leaders should participate, so that technical research and technical leadership can be combined, so as to implement the research results among the masses. Third, according to different agricultural seasons, absorb different technical experts to participate, so as to absorb more and better specialized technical experience. Fourth, absorb primary school teachers and individual intellectuals in the village to participate, because single farmers' research is most likely to be biased. Primary school teachers can introduce experiences from newspapers from various places, and can also use science to prove the farmers' one-sided experiences, making it easy to combine experience and science.
　　In terms of technical guidance, according to the experience of Beiliu Village, it is best to use typical examples for publicity, so that the masses can easily accept it. For example, Zhou Kaoxian of Beiliu Village said: "The year before last, when planting cotton, I planted sixty pumpkin plants per mu. In the autumn, I harvested seventy pumpkins of all sizes, and only harvested fifteen jin of cotton. Last year, I didn't plant any. The cotton grew very well, and I harvested forty jin of cotton. This year, I have experience, and I won't plant any pumpkins in the cotton field." Another example is Wang Wenzhi, who planted sesame in the cotton field last year. Later, he saw that the sesame was preventing the cotton from growing, so he cut down the sesame to save the cotton. But because it was too late, the cotton was not saved, and most of the cotton did not bloom in the autumn." Another example is Liu Tucheng, who said: "Last year, I was told to soak the seeds in warm water, but I didn't believe it. But I am a production team leader, and in order to play a model role, I had to soak them. But my thinking was not clear, and I didn't soak all of them. Later, when the seedlings came out, the ones that had been soaked grew better and better, and the ones that had not been soaked were short of seedlings and not good. Soaking is much better than not soaking." Using such typical examples to educate the masses has a great effect. The Technology Committee also promoted the experience of planting cotton and applying fertilizer last year to various production teams. For example, when planting cotton, the cotton seeds should be blanched with boiling water and then soaked in cold water, which can easily kill bacteria and germinate easily, and the sprouts are even and vigorous. When applying fertilizer, oil cake is best for planting cotton, but do not put it in the same furrow as the cotton seeds. One furrow should be fertilizer and one furrow should be seeds, which is easy to sprout and does not damage the buds. The experience of preventing oil blight is that cotton fields are most prone to oil blight, and ants are the medium of oil blight. Cotton fields are also most prone to ants. In order to reduce the occurrence of oil blight, hoe the cotton field once every three or four days after the cotton sprouts, until the cotton grows up (so you are not afraid of oil blight). Hoeing can kill some of the ants. The ones that are not killed are busy building nests and have no time to go to the cotton."
　　In short, the masses' technical requirements have been improved. Combining the masses' technical requirements to further lead and implement science and technology is an important issue in current technical leadership. The practice of Beiliu can be used as a reference for various places.

　　北流村农业技术指导经验
    黎城北流村技术委员会，去年已获成绩，经整顿后，组织更加健全，技术指导上亦将更加发挥作用。据北流村的经验，首先应加强村的技术委员会的组织与领导，村技术委员会的组织，应吸收如下的几种人参加：一、吸收对农事有经验的老农参加（即有专长的技术能手），因为他们在农业方面有丰富的经验及优良的技术，经过他们研究以后，能使技术及时传播出去。二、应有部分的干部和生产队长或组长参加，这样可使技术研究与技术领导相结合，以便把研究的成果贯彻到群众中去。三、根据农事不同的季节，吸收不同的技术能手参加，这样可吸收更多更好的专门技术经验。四、吸收村的小学教员与村中个别知识分子参加，因为单农民研究，最容易偏于一面，小学教员可介绍报纸各地的经验，同时还可将农民一面的经验，拿科学证明，易使经验与科学相结合。
    在技术指导上，根据北流村的经验，最好用典型例子进行宣传，这样群众容易接受。如北流村周考贤说：“前年种棉花，一亩带了南瓜六十棵，到了秋后，大大小小的南瓜收了七十个，只收了棉花十五斤，去年没有带。花长的很好，收了花四十斤，今年我可有了经验啦，花地一棵南瓜也不带了；又如王文治，去年将花地带上芝麻，以后看见芝麻胁花长不成，他为了挽救棉花，将芝麻绿割掉，但因为时间已晚，棉花终于没有挽救过来，秋后大部棉花未有开花。”又如刘土成说：“去年叫温汤浸种自己不相信，但自己是个生产大队长，为了起模范作用，不得不浸，可是思想没有打通，终于未全部浸完，后来苗儿出来，浸过的越长越好，未浸过的又缺苗，又不好，浸比不浸强的很多。”用这类典型来教育群众，收效很大。技术委员会又将去年种棉花与施肥的经验，推广到各生产小组内。如种花时，花籽用开水汤一下，后用冷水浸过，这样容易杀菌，容易发芽，而发出的芽，又齐又旺。施肥时，种棉花上油饼最好，但不要同棉籽上在同一犁沟内，要一犁肥一犁籽，这样容易出，又不坏芽。防止油汗的经验，大家得出是，花地最好生油汗，而蚂蚁是油汗的媒介，花地又最好生蚂蚁；为使油汗少生，在棉花长出土后，隔三天或四天，锄一次，直至棉花长大（就不怕油汗了）为止。这样一面锄，可制死一部分蚂蚁，制不死的亦忙于垒窝，无暇上花。
    总之群众的技术要求是提高了，结合群众的技术要求，来进一步的领导贯彻科学技术，是目前技术领导的重要问题，北流的做法，可供各地参考。
