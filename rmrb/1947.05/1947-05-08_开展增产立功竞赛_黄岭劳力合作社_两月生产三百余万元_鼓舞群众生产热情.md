　　Launching Emulation Drives for Increased Production
    Huangling Labor Cooperative
    Achieves Over 3 Million Yuan in Production in Two Months
    Inspiring Mass Enthusiasm
    [Reported by our newspaper in Bo'ai] Huangling Village launched a mass emulation drive for increased production, selecting various models, which greatly increased the production enthusiasm of the masses. This village is located in a border area. The production movement started last winter. To resolve the contradictions between production, guard duty, and corvée labor, a labor cooperative was established, with labor as shares and unified exchange of labor for production. In the first summary, each share received dividends of over 10,000 yuan. During the Lunar New Year's summary, eleven production, corvée labor, and combat models, including Wang Gaoshan, were selected. After that, the village launched an emulation drive. Since the start of the emulation drive, production has greatly increased. From the thirteenth day of the first lunar month to the fifteenth day of the second lunar month, in sixty-two days, the coal mine earned 1,059,078 yuan, the sulfur mine earned 1,613,020 yuan, and transportation earned 1,027,530 yuan, totaling 3,699,628 yuan. A total of 7,275 workdays were used for corvée labor, production, and participation in the war, with an average earning of 524 yuan per workday (compared to an average of 350 yuan last winter). The entire cooperative, with 140 shares, distributed 26,430 yuan per share. The well-organized production greatly encouraged the masses' enthusiasm in carrying out various tasks. The spring land reclamation movement was first launched within the production and corvée labor organizations, with cadres dividing responsibilities to mobilize the "backward." Production was only delayed for two days during the mobilization, and the work has now been completed. On the tenth of last month, a summary of the production in the past two months was conducted. After discussions in group meetings, eight model coal miners, including Liu Guoxiang, nine model sulfur miners, including Wang Hangzhou, and two skilled animal handlers, including Wang Shixi, were selected, totaling nineteen production models. In terms of corvée labor and participation in the war, four models, including Wang Xiaoguang, were selected. Among the sixteen militiamen, four, including Wang Bujing, were selected. In terms of work, four village officials, including village public security officer Wang Daliang, Farmers' Association Chairman Wang Gaoshan, village deputy Liu Yugui, and secretary Wang Shengzhi, were selected. In the mass movement, twelve active women, including Wang Guihua, and three model children were selected. In total, the village selected forty-six models, who were awarded prizes in four grades. This method of reporting achievements, evaluating merits, and commending models has played a significant role in promoting production. Liu Geta, a militiaman who was not very active in his work, became active after these two selections of models and was selected in this evaluation. Finally, everyone wrote the names of the selected models on the merit books and hung up the honor roll to show commendation. (Zhipeng)
