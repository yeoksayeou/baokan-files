Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi Front, 17th: Special Correspondent Wei Ming reports: After the elite 167th Brigade of Hu Zongnan was annihilated, I met with Li Kungang, the major general brigade commander of that brigade, three times. This small, thin man from Rong County, Sichuan, graduated from the sixth class of Whampoa Military Academy and was greatly trusted by Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan, having served as Hu's deputy chief of staff. Before being captured, he often arrogantly boasted that his troops were the "Number One Army in the World," but the battle of Panlong thoroughly shattered this pride. The first meeting was on the morning of May 5th, the day after Li laid down his arms. I stepped over the fallen barbed wire and entered the fortified town of Panlong, which had just been captured, through the destroyed bunker forest and outer moat; at the intersection of Dingzi Street, I encountered this officer wearing a tattered American-style military uniform. At the time, he was being escorted by several People's Liberation Army soldiers back to a small earthen cave on the northwest side of Panlong Town; this was the headquarters of General Wang Zhen, who directly commanded the Battle of Panlong. After everyone was seated, General Wang began talking with Li: "The day before yesterday, I sent you a letter urging you to lay down your arms and not make unnecessary resistance, but unfortunately you did not accept my suggestion." Li stubbornly raised his head and mumbled in defense, "I didn't receive that letter." General Wang explained the People's Liberation Army's policy on prisoners of war, assuring him that his life was guaranteed, so he could feel free to tell the truth. At this time, Tu Jian, major general and deputy brigade commander of the 167th Brigade, and Xiao Bolian, commander of the 499th Regiment, were also escorted in. Tu, a native of Hubei and a graduate of the eighth class of Whampoa, leaned on a cane, claiming that he had developed a joint disease after invading the border area. When he saw General Wang Zhen, he said, "Now the country doesn't need war, that's the truth, we must move towards the path of peace." General Wang praised his desire and said, "As long as Chiang's officers and generals can truly be responsible to the country, not sacrifice the nation and people's rights, and implement Mr. Sun Yat-sen's proposal of 'land to the tiller,' peace is very easy. But now, please see what you have actually done?" Speaking to here, the People's General couldn't help but stand up excitedly. "The people of the border area built the border area with their own hands, there are no imperialist privileges here, and the people have gained freedom. But this blessed land has now been turned into such a miserable state by you. May I ask, where haven't you burned, killed, and looted? A village near Yongping had only seventeen cows in total, and you killed all seventeen. This is a blood feud for the people!" Tu said anxiously, "These are all the sins of war, without war there wouldn't be these things." But Li said, "What Mr. Wang said just now are all political issues, I am a soldier, I only know how to obey, I never talk about politics." General Wang immediately and sternly pointed out, "Soldiers today in fact have no way of not dealing with politics. The so-called 'not talking about politics' is only deceiving oneself. Is resisting aggression and fighting for democracy called politics, and supporting aggression and destroying democracy not called politics? If one obeys despotism, betrays the country, and harms the people, then one is willing to be an enemy of the Chinese nation, like the officers under Wang Jingwei. Such a person is not worthy of being a Chinese officer, and this excuse will never be forgiven by the Chinese people." General Wang added, "Let's not talk about other things, let's just ask if you paid for the people's wooden planks, cattle, sheep, chickens, and pigs? But look at our discipline. You call us 'bandits', aren't your consciences ashamed?" This question caused the heads of all Chiang's officers and generals in the cave to droop one by one.

　　On the 6th, I met with Li again in his own residence. At that time, he was looking at "News Briefs" on the kang, and Tu was sitting on the left side of the ground. When asked about their impressions of the People's Liberation Army's combat effectiveness, Li thought that the People's Liberation Army's close combat operations were very good; the elimination of the enemy's strength was very powerful. Li said: "We can't do this. After we discover your main force, we can't freely move our troops, and we can't cooperate and help each other." Tu said: "When we arrived at Panlong, we couldn't see a single commoner, but I personally saw that as soon as you captured Panlong, the villagers came back to carry white flour."

　　On the 7th, I saw Li Kungang for the third time at General Wang Zhen's headquarters. He "talked about politics" this day too. He said: "From the perspective of the country and the nation, civil war should not happen." He told reporters: "The attrition of Chiang Hu's army is very serious. The 167th Brigade had 150 people in a company at the time of departure, but in less than two months, the attrition was one-third. The reason is that the march caused illness, mild illness turned into serious illness, and serious illness led to death; in addition, there was desertion." When the reporter told him that most of these attrition victims had been taken in by the Liberation Army, he couldn't help but laugh. In this conversation, he specially thanked General Wang Zhen for taking care of his life.

　　王震将军面斥李昆岗
    军人不谈政治只是自欺欺人服从专制卖国人民不能原谅
    【新华社陕北前线十七日电】特派记者韦明报导：胡宗南的精锐一六七旅被歼后，记者曾三次会见该旅少将旅长李昆岗。这个瘦小个子的四川荣县人，在黄埔六期毕业之后，很得蒋介石、胡宗南的信任，曾任过胡的副参谋长。被俘以前他常狂妄的自诩他的部队是“天下第一军”，但是蟠龙一战却使这种骄傲彻底破灭了。第一次会见是在李放下武器的第二天五月五日上午，记者跨过横倒的铁丝网，从击毁了的碉堡林和外壕之间，进入了刚被攻克的要塞化了的蟠龙镇；在丁字街口碰到了这个穿着破旧美式军装的军官。当时他正被几个人民解放军的战士押送着，走回蟠龙镇西北边的一个小土窑；这里就是直接指挥蟠龙之战的王震将军的司令部。王将军在大家坐定之后，就和李开始了谈话：“前天我就有信给你，催你放下武器，不要作无谓的抵抗，可惜你没有接受我的建议。”李强自抬起头来喃喃地辩饰道：“我没有收到那封信。”王将军向他解释人民解放军的俘虏政策，告慰他：他的生命是有保障的，因此尽可放心说老实话。这时一六七旅少将副旅长涂健、四九九团团长萧伯廉也被解送来了。涂是湖北人，黄埔八期生，手扶拐杖，自称是因为侵入边区后关节得了病。他见到王震将军就说：“现在国家不需要战争这是真理，我们要向和平的路上走。”王将军赞许他这种愿望，并且说：“只要蒋军将校真能对国家负责，不牺牲民族、民权，实行孙中山先生主张的耕者有其田，和平是很容易的。但现在请看看你们实际上作了什么？”说到这里，这位人民的将军禁不住激动的站起来。“边区的老百姓以自己的手建设了边区，这里没有帝国主义的特权，人民获得了自由。但这片福地现在却被你们弄成这样凄惨。试问你们在那一处没有烧杀掳掠？永坪附近的一个村子，一共只有十七头牛，你们就杀了十七头。这对人民是血海深仇呀！”涂窘急地说：“这都是战争的罪恶，没有战争就不会有这些。”李却说：“刚才王先生所说的都是政治问题，我是个军人，只知服从，从不谈政治。”王将军立刻严正的指出：“现在的军人事实上没有不管政治的。所谓‘不谈政治’，只是自欺欺人。难道反侵略、争民主叫政治，拥护侵略、摧残民主就不叫政治？如果专制卖国、祸害人民也服从，那末这就是自甘为中华民族的敌人，和汪精卫部下的军官一样。这种人不配身为中国的将校，这种借口也决得不到中国人民的原谅。”王将军又补充说：“我们且不谈旁的，只问你们拿了老百姓的木板、牛、羊、鸡、猪给了钱没有？但是看看我们的纪律怎么样？你们倒叫我们作‘土匪’，你们的良心不惭愧吗？”这一问使得窑里所有的蒋军将校的头一个个都低下去了。
    六日我又在李自己的住所里会见了他，那时他正在炕上看《新闻简讯》，涂坐在地的左侧。当记者问起他们对人民解放军的战斗力有何感想，李认为人民解放军近迫作业很好；消灭对方有生力量这一点很厉害。李说：“这个我们办不到，我们发现你们主力之后不能自由运动部队，也不能相互合作援助。”涂说：“我们到蟠龙时见不到一个老百姓，但我亲见你们攻下蟠龙就有老乡回来搬运白面。”
    七日我在王震将军的司令部第三次见到李昆岗，这天他也“谈政治”了。他说：“就国家民族说，内战是不应该的。”他向记者说：“蒋胡军的减员很厉害，一六七旅在出发时是一百五十人一个连，但是不到两个月减员三分之一。原因是行军拖出了病，轻病拖成重病，重病拖死；此外就是逃亡。”当记者告诉他这些减员大部已被解放军收容了的时候，他就不自禁的笑起来了。在这次谈话里，他特意向记者感谢了王震将军对他生活的照顾。
