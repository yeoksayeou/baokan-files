Xinhua News Agency Short Commentary:

　　The Disfavored Concubine

    U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Acheson publicly revealed on the 11th that an important part of the so-called Truman Doctrine is to rebuild reactionary Germany and Japan. MacArthur also said during a secret meeting with Japanese Emperor Hirohito on the 6th of this month: "I will do my best to defend Japan as I defend the United States." This news is a warning to the people of the anti-fascist allied countries. The Chinese people, in particular, cannot tolerate the reconstruction of reactionary Japan and must resolutely oppose it!

    The news of the American rebuilding of Japan is also a great irony for the Chiang Kai-shek clique. Because of their unprecedented and shameless betrayal of the country, they originally hoped to be the first favorite of the United States in the Far East. Now the United States has openly stated that it favors the Japanese reactionaries even more, completely siding with Japan in Chiang-Japan relations, without even perfunctorily addressing the facade of "resistance against Japan" that Chiang Kai-shek had worn for several years. Although Chiang Kai-shek will continue to be a loyal running dog of American imperialism, he is already a disfavored concubine compared to the Japanese reactionaries and will naturally compete for favor and be jealous. Sun Ke, vice president of the Chiang government, told reporters: "China cannot but be anxious to see the Japanese who cooperated with the military in the past continue to hold power or make a comeback." (AFP) Wu Bannong, the representative of the Chiang government for compensation and return of materials, also said regarding the issue of Japanese compensation: "I am very disappointed." He also said: "I am not optimistic that a large amount of materials plundered by Japan in China can be compensated." "Under the instructions of the Allied Headquarters, the number of materials returned by Japan is really a drop in the bucket." (Associated Press)

    However, all these complaints from the Chiang Kai-shek clique are, on the one hand, coquetry towards their American masters, and on the other hand, deception of the Chinese people, as if they are still arguing with the United States and Japan for the interests of China. In fact, although the Chiang Kai-shek clique has some contradictions with the Japanese reactionaries, since they have become the running dogs of the American reactionaries in invading China, they cannot but also become the running dogs of the Japanese reactionaries in invading China at the same time, that is, the running dogs of the running dogs. The fact that the Japanese reactionaries, relying on the support of their American masters, have obtained fishing rights in China's territorial waters from Chiang Kai-shek, obtained Changlu salt as industrial raw materials, and obtained the gauze market in the South China area is ironclad proof of this fact. The clarification of the so-called "Truman Doctrine" is a further exposure of the ugly faces of the American reactionaries and the Chinese reactionaries for the Chinese people. The Chinese people will never allow their mortal enemy, the Japanese invading forces, to revive and will fight for the compensation they deserve. But in order to achieve this goal, we must resolutely oppose the double traitor and double running dog Chiang Kai-shek. (Shaanbei, 14th dispatch)

### 失宠的小老婆

　　失宠的小老婆
    美副国务卿亚泽逊十一日公开透露所谓杜鲁门主义的一个重要内容，是要重建反动的德国和日本。麦克阿瑟本月六日对日皇裕仁密谈时，也说：“我将尽力保卫日本，如保卫美国一样。”这个消息对于反法西斯同盟各国人民，是一个警告。中国人民对于反动日本之重建，尤其不能容忍，必须坚决起来反对！
    美国重建日本的消息，对于蒋介石集团也是很大的讽刺。因为他们空前无耻的卖国，原希望作远东方面美国的第一宠儿；现在美国公开表示更宠爱日本反动派，在蒋日关系上完全袒护日本，连蒋介石挂过几年“抗日”招牌的面子也不敷衍一下。蒋介石今后虽仍将继续作美帝国主义的忠实走狗，但比起日本反动派来，却已经是一个失了宠的小老婆，自然要争宠，要吃醋。蒋政府副主席孙科对记者说：“中国看到以前与军部合作的日本人继续当政，或卷土重来，是不能不引起焦虑的。”（法新社）蒋政府赔偿与归还物资代表吴半农，关于日本赔偿问题，也说：“甚感失望。”又说：“对于日本在中国所掠夺之大量物资能在赔偿中获得抵偿，并不乐观。”“在盟军总部指示下，日本所退还物资之数目，实为九牛一毛。”（合众社）
    但是蒋介石集团的这一切怨言，一面固然是对美国主子的撒娇，一面却是对中国人民的欺骗，似乎他们还在为着中国的利益而与美国和日本争吵；事实上，蒋介石集团尽管与日本反动派存在着若干矛盾，但是他们既然做了美国反动派侵略中国的走狗，就不能不同时也成为日本反动派侵略中国的走狗，即走狗的走狗。日本反动派依靠美国主子的支持从蒋介石手中取得了中国领海的渔权，取得了长户盐作为工业原料，取得了华南一带的纱布市场，正是这一事实的铁证。而所谓“杜鲁门主义”的阐明，对于中国人民说来，更是美国反动派和中国反动派丑恶面目的进一步暴露。中国人民永远不能容许自己的死敌日本侵略势力复活，并将为应得的赔偿而奋斗。但是为要达到这个目的，就不能不坚决反对双料卖国贼双料走狗蒋介石。（陕北十四日电）
