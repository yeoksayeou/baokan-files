Where Does the Success Lie?
    ——A Review of the Performance of "Li Youcai's Rhymes"
    Yu Jia

　　The People's Theater Troupe's performance of "Li Youcai's Rhymes" in a certain town was unanimously praised by the audience, and some people even excitedly discussed it for several days afterward. This shows the success of the performance of "Li Youcai's Rhymes" and its profound impact on the audience. But where exactly does the success of "Li Youcai's Rhymes" lie? Is it because the script is well-written? Is it because of the good directing techniques? Or is it because of the actors' high skills? I think these are all aspects of its success, but the most fundamental thing is their familiarity with rural life and their genuine experience of the peasants' emotions. This is the result of the playwright, director, and actors having a deep learning experience in rural life, truly achieving a concentrated expression of writing, directing, and acting as a unified whole. Therefore, the audience feels that the characters on the stage are realistic and vivid, not stiff and artificial.

　　Li Youcai's genuineness and honesty, Old Qin's timidity and greed, Xiao Fu's simplicity and enthusiasm, as well as Yan Hengyuan's cunning, Guang Ju's viciousness, and De Gui's bullying, are all portrayed very successfully. Whether in appearance, tone, actions, stage presence, or continuous emotions, they all profoundly and realistically reflect the rural reality during the transition from the old society to the new society, causing strong stimulation to the audience's emotions and arousing hatred or sympathy for the characters in the play. These successes are not accidental, but the result of the hard work of the comrades of the People's Theater Troupe over the years. If today's general rural theater troupes could improve to this level in art, it would surely break some people's one-sided views on rural plays and make them no longer think that rural plays are uninteresting. It is hoped that the comrades of the People's Theater Troupe will make better progress on the existing foundation, and at the same time, help others in many ways and promote today's rural drama work.

　　From the performance of "Li Youcai's Rhymes," it is proved that the rural drama movement has not stagnated in a crude and backward state, but has improved. But does this mean that it is already enough? No, it should continue to develop, from familiarity with the lives of the peasants to further experiencing the ideological progress and emotional changes of the peasants after the land reform. At the same time, it should further experience the thoughts and feelings of rural cadres and soldiers from peasant backgrounds. Because in the countryside, there are not only peasants, but also cadres from peasant backgrounds and soldiers who defend the fruits of the people's liberation. If we do not extensively learn from them, we will not be able to portray them on the stage. In this performance, this weakness was shown. The process of Xiao Yuan's transformation from a simple peasant into a village cadre who is detached from the masses is too simple, and the emotions are not real enough. Zhang, the worker, who only cares about superficial work and does not seek to understand the masses in depth, is also not clear enough. The down-to-earth spirit of Old Yang, the director of the county farmers' association, his good style of being good at approaching the masses, and his working methods of being good at discovering problems, should be prominently presented to the audience, but he failed to express them well. Instead, he ate the white flour specially borrowed for him by Old Qin's family (logically, he should strive to eat cornbread), which shows that the playwright, director, and actors do not have enough experience with the character and emotions of the village cadres and Xiao Yuan, who has just escaped the impoverished class and is being used by Hengyuan. If the comrades of the People's Theater Troupe can more widely expand their experience of rural life to cadres from peasant backgrounds and peasants like Xiao Yuan who are not firm in their positions, they will receive greater success.

　　成功在什么地方
    ——评《李有才板话》的演出
    羽嘉
    人民剧团这次在某镇演出《李有才板话》，得到全场观众一致的赞扬，甚至有些人看了以后，兴奋地连着谈论好几天，这表明了《李有才板话》演出的成功，对观众感染的深刻。但《李有才板话》演出的成功究竟在什么地方呢？是剧本写的好？是导演手法好？还是演员技术高？我想，这都是它成功的一面，最基本的还是他们对农村生活的熟悉，真实地体验了农民的情感。这是剧作者、导演、演员在农村生活方面有了深刻学习体验的收获，真正做到了写剧、导演、演技三位一体的集中表现。因而，使观众感到舞台上的人物逼真生动，不是生硬的做作。
    李有才的真正老诚，老秦的胆小贪利，小福的纯朴热情，以及阎恒元的奸诈，广聚的凶恶，得贵的仗势欺人，都演得很成功，不论在外形、语气、动作、台风、以及连贯的情感，都非常深刻突出，真实地反映了旧社会向新社会转变时的农村现实，使观众的情感受到强烈的刺激，引起对剧中人的憎恶或同情。这些成功不是偶然的，是人民剧团的同志们多年辛苦努力的成果。倘使今天的一般农村剧团都能在艺术上提高到这样程度，一定会打破一些人对农村剧片面看法，使他们不再认为农村剧没有意思。希望人民剧团的同志们，在现有的基础上更好的向前进步，同时，多方面去帮助别人，推动今天的农村戏剧工作。
    从《李有才板话》的演出中，证明了农村戏剧运动，并没有停留在粗糙落后的地步，而向前提高了。但是不是说已经很够了呢？不，还应继续向前发展，从对农民主活的熟悉而更进一步地去体验土地改革后农民思想上的进步和情感上的变化。同时更应进一步地去体验农村干部和农民出身的战士的思想情感。因为农村中不仅有农民，也有农民出身的干部和保卫人民翻身果实的战士，若不广泛地去向他们学习，就无法在舞台上表现他们。在这次的演出里，就表现了这个弱点。小元由一个朴素的农民变成一个脱离群众的村干部的过程太简单，情感也不够真实。张工作员的只顾表面工作，不求深入了解群众，也表现得不够明朗。县农会主任老杨的踏实精神，善于接近群众的好作风，善于发现问题的工作方法，应突出地呈现在观众面前，但他没能很好的表现出来，反而吃老秦家专为他借的白面（按理他应争着吃糠窝窝），这就说明剧作者、导演、演员对村干和刚脱离贫苦阶层受恒元利用的小元的性格和情感体验得不够。如果人民剧团的同志们能把对农村生活的体验更广泛地扩大到农民出身的干部和小元一类的立场不坚定的农民中去，将会收到更大的成功。
