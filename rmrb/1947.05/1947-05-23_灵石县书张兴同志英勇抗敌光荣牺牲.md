[This report from the Taiyue News on the 21st] Comrade Zhang Xing, Secretary of the Lingshi County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, led the militia to fight back against the invasion of the Yan Xishan diehard Li Zifa's troops and safeguard the safety of the mass rally. Unfortunately, he gloriously sacrificed on April 30th. On that day, all the cadres sorrowfully swore: to designate May as "Revenge Month" and kill 200 enemies to console the heroic spirit of Comrade Zhang Xing. It is reported that Comrade Zhang Xing was from Lingshi, 37 years old. When the Red Army crossed the Yellow River to the east in 1936, he organized peasant guerrillas to fight against feudal forces. During the Anti-Japanese War, he served as a Liaison Officer of the Sacrifice League, a member of the CPC District Committee, and the Minister of the Organization Department of the County Party Committee. Last spring, he came to Lingshi to serve as the Secretary of the County Party Committee.
