　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 2nd -- Yamazaki Akio, a major squad leader of the Japanese Security First Brigade stationed in Yangqu, defected to our Jin Sui People's Liberation Army in mid-April. According to him, Yan Xishan recently reorganized the Japanese troops remaining in Shanxi into regiments and formed two field columns. The commander of the First Column is Imamura, the current commander of the Second Security Brigade stationed in Xinxian, which has three regiments under its command and is reorganized from the original Second, Seventh, and Eighth Security Brigades stationed in Xinxian and Datong. The commander of the Second Column is Iwata, the former senior staff officer of the Shanxi Security Column Headquarters, which is reorganized from the original Third, Fourth, and Fifth Brigades stationed in Yangqu and Yangquan. The First and Sixth Brigades (both stationed in Yangqu) were reorganized into independent field regiments, directly under the command of Yan. In addition, Motoyama, the former Brigade Commander of the 84th Brigade of the 114th Division of the Japanese Expeditionary Army in Shanxi, was hired as a consultant. Yamazaki also stated that in the disastrous defeat in Shouyang on August 22 last year, the commander and deputy commander of the Third Security Brigade, Oba and Ogawa, were both killed. The general Japanese soldiers deeply feel that it is meaningless to be cannon fodder for Yan Xishan's civil war, but they cannot get rid of it.

　　阎军日兵不愿当替死鬼
    山崎明夫向我投诚
    【新华社晋绥二日电】驻阳曲之日军保安一大队少校班长山崎明夫，于上月中旬向我晋绥人民解放军投诚。据称：阎锡山近将留晋日军各保安大队改编为团，组成两个野战纵队。第一纵队长由现驻忻县之保安二大队长今村担任，下辖三个团，系由原驻忻县大同之保安二、七、八三个大队所改编。第二纵队长由原山西保安纵队部高级参谋岩田担任，由原驻阳曲、阳泉之三、四、五，三个大队改编。一、六两大队（均驻阳曲）改编为野战独立团，由阎直接指挥。另聘请原山西日本派遣军一一四师八四旅团长元泉为顾问。山崎又称：去年八月二十二日，寿阳战斗惨败，保安三大队正副队长大场、小川均被击毙。一般日军士兵深感替阎锡山作内战炮灰毫无意义，但亦无法解脱。
