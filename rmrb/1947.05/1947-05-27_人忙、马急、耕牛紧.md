　　People Busy, Horses Urgent, Oxen Tense
    Zhang Peili
  　Roosters crow before dawn, a myriad of families shout to their oxen
    As the east begins to lighten, the quiet village is filled with the sounds of people calling, horses neighing… growing fainter in the distance. In the cool morning light, the villagers, shouldering seeders and carrying plows, head towards the fields. These fields are no longer someone else's land, but their own land.
    Usually, after arriving at the fields, the villagers would sit at the edge of the field and smoke a few pipes of tobacco. Now, it's different; as soon as they arrive, they harness the oxen and begin working intensely with whips and shouts.
    When the sun is climbing over the eastern mountain peaks, I saw our landlord, Wang Taian, and six others in the fields. This is a mutual aid team. Their plan is for the seven of them to complete 420 loads of horse manure today. The horse manure is piled up on a farm south of the village, about 250 meters away from this field. All seven of them are strong, but none want to fall behind. A load of horse manure on their shoulders is nothing to them, and they stride quickly, vying to be the vanguard.
    They are all liberated peasants, working to complete the spring plowing early, preparing to go to the front to fight Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, and defend the fruits of their liberation.
  　Whip the horses, and give priority to planting the military dependents' land
    On the road to Changyuan, one must pass through a field of tender green wheat. In this wheat field, a burly farmer is raising his whip and holding the plow. The horse, fat and muscular, is moving quickly. Because it hasn't rained, the horse's hooves are constantly kicking up three feet of dust. This burly man, stripped to the waist and covered in sweat, holds the plow, keeping pace with the horse's speed. This man is called Ma Changming, and his home is in Licheng Changyuan.
    "Hasn't your family finished farming their land yet?" I greeted him.
    "Not yet! I'm rushing to plant the military dependents' land now." He didn't turn his head, continuing to urge the horse forward, and continued to say to me:
    "Only with victories at the front can we have good times in the rear. Don't forget the well-digger when you drink the water. Shouldn't we plow the military dependents' land first?"
　Father and Son compete, scoring another victory
    Mutual aid teams challenge each other, and landlord Benxian also challenged his old father: "Dad! We're going to finish repairing this 1.5 mu of riverside land today."
    "Good! We'll do it." Benxian's father accepted the challenge.
    A slight morning breeze carries the sound of digging the earth, puff! puff! The flying dust makes their eyes squint. Don't think that this fifty-year-old man is old. Now he waves his hands, his face doesn't change color, and he doesn't gasp for breath. He says to his son with a smile, "Don't get impatient! I won't be less than you when the sun sets!"
    When the sun sets in the west, 1.5 mu of riverside land is repaired. Benxian measured the land his father had repaired. He laughed! He held up his palm and compared two fives, saying, "Dad! The same. You are older than me, and you've scored another victory!"

　　人忙、马急、耕牛紧
    张培礼
  　鸡鸣天未亮，万家吆牛声
    东方刚刚发白，沉静的村庄，便涌起一片人唤、马嘶……由近渐渐而远了，在带着凉意的晨光中，老乡们肩耧扛犁走向了田地，这田地已经不是别人的土地，而是自己的土地了。
    在日常，老乡们到地之后，总要坐在地头吃几袋烟，现在不一样了；他们一到地里便把牛套上，于是便扬鞭叱牛紧张的工作起来。
    当太阳正爬在东山头的时候，在田野里见了我们的房东王太安，还有六个人，这是一个互助组。他们的计划，七个人在今天一天要完成四百二十担马粪。马粪堆在村南一个农场上，距离这块地有二百五十公尺。他们七个人，一个比一个强，但谁也不愿落后，一担马粪放在他们肩上简直不算一回事，步伐飞快，争着夺先锋。
    他们都是翻身农民，为的是早些完成春耕，准备上前方打蒋贼，保卫他们的翻身果实。
  　马上加鞭，理当先种军属地
    到长垣路上要经过一片嫩绿的麦原，在这麦原上，一位彪形庄稼汉扬着鞭撑着犁，那马肥头肉股走的很快，因为没有下雨，马蹄下不断扬起三尺高的尘土。这位彪形庄稼汉赤着膊，汗流满面，撑着犁跟追着马的速度走着。这位大汉叫马长明，家是黎城长垣人。
    “你家的地还没有务好吗？”我向他打招呼。
    “没有哩！现在赶着种军属地。”他头也不回，不停地赶着马向前走，一面继续对我说：
    “有前方打胜仗，才有后方好时光，喝水不忘开井人，还不该先耕军属地么？”
　父子比赛下，又打一胜仗
    互助组都互相挑战，房东本贤也向他老父亲挑战：“爹！今天这块亩半河下地，咱俩要修完”。
    “好！咱就做。”本贤爹应了战。
    微微的晨风吹送来扑哧！扑哧！的撅地声，尘土飞扬使他们眼迷缝起来。不要看这到五十岁的人老了，现在他挥着手，面不变色气不喘，笑眯眯同他儿子说：“别发燥！太阳落我不会比你少！”
    当太阳西下时，一亩半河地修完了，本贤步了步他爹修的地，他发笑了！他伸起巴掌比了两个五说：“爹！一样，你比我年纪老，又打一胜仗！”
