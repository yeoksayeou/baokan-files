　　Transforming Dry Land into Paddy Fields
    Wangwu Masses Build Canals and Dig Wells
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 3rd dispatch] The liberated peasants of Wangwu are actively building canals and digging wells to transform dry land into paddy fields. In Dongyang Village, Shaoyuan Township, under the leadership of activists Wei Zizhi and Li Faxiang, a small river and a hot spring have been channeled into an irrigation canal, diverting water into the fields along West Street, irrigating 200 mu of land. Currently, Huayuangou, Zhaopan, Xiayan and other villages have also begun to build canals. Fengshi, Duanao, Wangzhuang and other villages are preparing to construct wells. The county plans to transform 2,000 mu of dry land into paddy fields.
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 3rd dispatch] Qin source is actively building water mills to save labor and invest in agricultural production. In this county, the livestock losses are severe during the War of Resistance against Japan, and the women are busy pushing millstones all year round and cannot produce. In Pipayuan Village, women lost 19,500 workdays throughout the year due to pushing millstones. This year, the war is frequent and the labor force is even more lacking. The First Administrative Office accepted the demands of the masses and specially hired water mill technicians and the administrative office's water conservancy team to inspect Qin source and design water mill repairs. At present, Yangcheng, Qinyu, Zihong, and Pipayuan in the seventh district; Shishou, Dongzhuang, Xiagan, and Shiqiao in the fifth district; Guodao and Mianshang in the fourth district; and Ziqiang and Jiaokou in the second district have all completed surveying. According to the survey results, ten water mills can be completed this year. Qinyu Village also plans to install a water mill and a water fan. We have now begun to fell lumber and make adobe bricks, and it is expected that five sets will be completed by the Dragon Boat Festival. The other villages are preparing and will begin work after the spring plowing is over. The county government has specially lent 450 dan of grain and 700,000 yuan to support this project.

    王屋群众修渠凿井
    【本报太岳三日电】王屋翻身农民皆纷纷修渠凿井，变旱地为水田。邵原镇东阳村在翻身积极分子卫自治、李法祥领导下，已将小河与一温泉开为水渠，顺着西街引水入田，浇地二百亩。目前花园沟、赵盘、下沿等村亦先后开始修渠。逢石、段凹、王庄等村正筹设水井。全县计划变旱地为水田二千亩。
    【本报太岳三日电】沁源积极兴修水磨，节省劳力投入农业生产。该县在抗日战争中，牲畜损失严重，妇女们终年忙于推磨，不能生产。琵琶园村，妇女全年因推磨误工一万九千五百个。今年战争频繁，劳力更缺乏，一专署接受群众要求，特聘请水磨技师与专署水利组赴沁源各地视察，设计修水磨。现七区阳城、琴峪、紫红、琵琶园；五区师首、东庄、下赣、石桥；四区郭道、棉上；二区自强、交口等村，均已测量完毕。据测量结果，今年可完成十盘水磨。琴峪村并计划安置水碾及水扇车。现已开始伐木料、打土坯，预计端阳节可完成五盘。其余各村正在准备，待春耕告一段落即可动工。该县政府特贷粮四百五十石、款七十万元，予以扶植。
