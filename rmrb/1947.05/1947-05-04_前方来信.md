　　Letters from the Front
  (Part One)
    …From the conversations I've had these past few days with Deputy Political Commissar Zhang, Comrade Chen Feiqin, and others, and after reading some of the newspapers and books published here, I feel there are some points worth bringing to your attention, so that you can pay attention to these issues in your future work.
    As soon as we arrived, we felt how urgently music work is needed today. On the way here, there was a group of soldiers from the guard regiment traveling with us, and they kept asking us to teach them songs. When we asked them to sing, they sang either "old antiques" or very inappropriate ditties. For example, one ditty used the tune of "Zhang Sheng Teases Yingying" but with lyrics about the Self-Defense War. After arriving here, I also talked to the Deputy Political Commissar about this issue, and he said that he had made two calls to action, but it still hasn't taken off. He views this problem very seriously.
    …On the other hand, we deeply feel the lack of connection between cultural work at the front and in the rear. Cultural work at the front is quite vigorous, with many gains and much experience, but also with many remaining problems. But in the past, we were completely isolated from these. Take the examples of works reflecting combat published at the front and in the rear. The works considered good at the front receive no attention from us. Those we consider good in the rear are met with great indifference here. (In fact, when we judge the quality of a piece of work, we should first look at its impact on reality.) The best piece of news reporting here, is "Unnecessary Worry" written by Lu Yaowu. The author is a liaison officer of a brigade. This work won the first prize for news reporting here, and was praised by the General Office (Yan'an). Commander Liu said it was the best piece of news reporting since the Self-Defense War.
    Other authors and works considered good here include Li Wenbo (he is a battalion commander, of worker-peasant origin, formerly a propagandist, and they are publishing a small collection of his works). He has become a typical model for cadres writing articles. His representative work is "Blood on the Sleeve," etc. (Reprinted in the second issue of Pingyuan Literature). Wang Ruo, the education section chief of the 9th Brigade of the 3rd Column, wrote "Unparalleled Love," as well as "Pulling Cannons in the Yellow River," "A Letter of Blood and Tears," and "Back from the Dead" (unfortunately, we can't find all these works at once). All are good works welcomed by the soldiers.
    Long pieces don't work here. Here, works of 1,500 or 2,000 characters are called long, and anything over 2,000 is a "landlord." The common works are several hundred to a thousand characters. Few people read long pieces.

  (Part Two)
    "…Recently, the front is preparing to publish some pamphlets. A collection of songs and a collection of poems have already been published. I flipped through the song collection, which has a total of thirteen songs. The first song is the March of the Volunteers, the second is the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention. Although the others are new, they are not as popular as the old ones. As for songs, Deputy Political Commissar Zhang has this opinion: Yangko is not suitable for the troops to sing. The troops need majestic songs.
    There is a great shortage of music workers. Everyone needs literary and artistic workers!"

### 前方来信

专栏：

　　前方来信
  （其一）
    ……从这几天和张副政委、陈斐琴同志等的谈话，并看了这里出版的一些报章书籍，觉得有些意见值得提给你，在今后的工作中注意这些问题。
    我们一出门，就感到开展音乐工作在今天是如何迫切的需要。一路上和我们同车的有一班警卫团的战士，一路上他们都要求我们教他们唱歌。我们要他们唱歌，他们唱的不是“老古董”，就是非常不象样的小调，如有一个小调是拿“张生戏莺莺”的调子配上自卫战争内容的。来这里后和副政委也谈到这个问题，他说已作了两次号召，但还不能搞起来。他把这问题看得很严重。
    …另一方面，我们深深感到前后方文化工作连系的不足。前方的文化工作是相当蓬勃的，有很多收获，有很多的经验，也还存在许多问题，但过去我们对这些都完全是隔膜的。拿前后方发表的反映战斗的作品为例，前方认为好的作品，我们一点也不注意，在后方我们认为好的，在这里又表示非常冷淡（事实上，我们看一篇作品的好坏应该首先看它对实际所起的作用）。这里认为最好的一篇通讯，是卢耀武写的《多余的耽心》，作者是一个旅的连络部长，这作品曾得这里通讯奖金甲等奖，刘师长说它是自卫战争以来最好的一篇通讯，并受到总社（延安）的表扬。
    其他这里认为好的作者和作品，有李文波（他是一个营长，工农出身，原宣传员，这里正在出他的作品的小集子。）他已成为干部写稿的典型，他的代表作是《袄袖上的血》等。（平原文艺二期曾转载）三纵九旅教育科长王若的《无比的爱》，还有《黄河里拉大炮》，《一封血泪的信》，《起死回生》（可惜我们不能一下把这些作品都找到），都是受战士欢迎的好作品。
    这里长东西是吃不开的，这里称一千五、两千字的作品就是长东西，两千以上的就是“大地主”了，普遍的作品都是几百字到一千来字，长的东西读的人很少。”
              （曾克、葛洛）
  （其二）
    “……最近前方准备出版一些小册子，歌集与诗已各出一册，歌集我翻了一下，共十三首，第一首是义勇军进行曲，第二首是三大纪律八项注意，其他虽是新的，但还没有旧的吃得开。至于歌，张副政委有这样的意见，秧歌是不适合部队唱的，部队需要雄壮的歌。
    音乐工作者非常缺乏，大家需要文艺工作者！”
                  （胡征）
