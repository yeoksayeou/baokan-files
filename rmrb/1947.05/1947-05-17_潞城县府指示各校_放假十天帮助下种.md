　　Lucheng County Government Directs All Schools
    To Have a Ten-Day Vacation to Help with Planting
    [This newspaper's Lucheng News] In order to overcome labor shortages, so as not to affect participation in the war and grain transport, and also not delay planting, the Lucheng County Government has specifically decided that all schools in the county will have a spring vacation of ten days. Areas that are busy with planting will have a vacation starting May 7th and will resume classes on the 17th. Areas that are not yet heavily involved in planting will have a vacation starting May 13th and will resume classes on the 23rd. After the vacation, students will help their families or participate in mass shock planting. Teachers will remain at their posts to carry out propaganda and encouragement education, and appropriately organize students for production and learning. If any teachers want to take care of their family's production during the vacation, they must obtain prior permission from their respective principals and must not delay the start of school.

　　潞城县府指示各校
    放假十天帮助下种
    【本报潞城讯】为了克服劳力困难，既不影响参战运粮，又不耽误下种，潞城县府特决定全县各学校一律放春假十天。正忙着下种地区于五月七号放假，十七号继续开学，还未大力忙于下种地区，五月十三日放假，二十三日继续开学。放假后学生帮助家庭或当群众突击下种，教员仍在岗位进行宣传鼓励教育，适当组织学生，生产与学习。如有的教员想假期照顾家里生产，必须经各校长事先允许，并一定不能耽误开学。（中兰）
