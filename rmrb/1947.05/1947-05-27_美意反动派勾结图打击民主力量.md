　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, May 23rd: According to the US Information Service, US and Italian representatives held negotiations in Washington on the 21st to "discuss possible ways to comprehensively resolve Italian financial and related issues caused by the war." The negotiation was agreed upon during Italian Prime Minister Gasperi's visit to the United States in January of this year. It is noted that since Gasperi's visit to the United States in January, Italy has subsequently experienced a cabinet crisis; now, as the Italian reactionaries are launching a second cabinet crisis, attempting to undermine the three-party coalition government and push the Communist Party out of the cabinet, the US-Italian negotiations fully expose the US imperialists' conspiracy to use Italy's financial difficulties to collude with Italian reactionaries to strike democratic forces.

　　美意反动派勾结图打击民主力量
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】据美国新闻处讯：美意两国代表于二十一日在华盛顿举行谈判，“讨论可能实行之办法，以期通盘解决由于战争所引起之意大利财政及有关问题”。该项谈判系本年一月间意总理加斯贝利访美时所约定者。按：自从加斯贝利一月访美后，意大利即随之发生一次阁潮；现在当意大利反动派第二次掀起阁潮，企图破坏三党联合政府，把共产党挤出内阁之际，美意举行此项谈判，完全暴露了美帝国主义利用意大利财政困难，以勾结意大利反动派打击民主力量的阴谋。
