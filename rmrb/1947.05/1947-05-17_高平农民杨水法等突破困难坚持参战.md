　　【Taiyue News, 15th of This Month】 Gaoping peasants Yang Shuifa and others were awarded the title of "Model War Participants." On April 16th, Yang Shuifa and nine other war-participating peasants from the First District of Gaoping lost contact on the day before the brigade departed from Houma, due to transferring the wounded elsewhere. They wanted to find the troops. The local Public Security Bureau, fearing they would encounter enemy stragglers on the road, advised them, "Let us issue you a certificate to return home!" But they refused this suggestion and insisted on going. On the 17th, I went to Jiangzhou and still hadn't found them. By this time, the dry rations they had brought were all gone, and they were hungry. They finally found a comrade in the original village who was leading the masses to participate in the war, and he offered to let them participate in the war there, but they said, "We can't stay here; we have to find them even if we have to beg for food." They refused and continued searching along the road. When their hunger became unbearable, they would beg for some food. Finally, they found the field hospital of the troops in a certain village. Upon learning that the war-participating masses from Gaoping were coming to send the wounded, they were overjoyed. Two people took shifts day and night on the street to wait. Sure enough, they found them. That evening, they returned to their original unit. The leadership quickly comforted them and awarded them the glorious title of "Model War Participants." When others asked them, "Why did you have to find your way back?" they replied affirmatively, "To defeat Chiang Kai-shek!"

　　高平农民杨水法等突破困难坚持参战
    【本报太岳十五日电】高平参战农民杨水法等十人荣获“参战模范”称号。四月十六日，高平一区参战农民杨水法等十人在大队从侯马出发的前一天，因到别处转运伤员，回来时失掉联络，他们要去找部队。当地公安局怕他们路上遇着敌人散兵，便劝他们说：“给你们开个证明回去吧”！但他们拒绝这个建议，坚决要去。十七日我到绛州仍未找着，这时他们带的干粮吃喝也光了，饿着肚子找到原村，那里住着一个领导参战群众的同志，留他们在那里参战，但他们说：“不能留在这里，讨吃也得找到”，又拒绝了他们，继续沿路找着，肚子饿不过就会乱讨些饭吃，终于在某村找到部队的野战所，探知高平参战群众要来送伤兵，他们高兴极了，两个人一班日夜轮流着在街上等，果然等到了。当天晚上就返回原部队，领导上连忙安慰他们一番，并奖给“参战模范”的光荣称号。别人问他们“怎么一定要找回来呢？”他们肯定地回答：“为打败蒋介石呀！”
