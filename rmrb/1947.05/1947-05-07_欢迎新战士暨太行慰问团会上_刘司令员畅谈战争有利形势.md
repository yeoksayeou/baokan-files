　　Welcome New Soldiers and Taihang慰问团 Meeting
    Commander Liu Speaks Freely About Favorable War Situation
    [Special dispatch from this newspaper] General Liu Bocheng's speech to the new soldiers of the military region's directly subordinate supplementary regiment is excerpted as follows:

    Comrades: This morning we just captured Tangyin city and wiped out the enemy cleanly. You comrades have also arrived at the front.

    Now we see that in northern Shaanxi, two enemy brigades were annihilated, in Shandong, three enemy brigades were annihilated, and here on the Tongpu railway line, fourteen county towns were liberated. In northern Henan, Chiang Kai-shek's rapid column and more than 30,000 local bandits were annihilated. This shows that in April we were in a counter-offensive period, and we will continue to launch major counter-offensives. Chiang Kai-shek has a total of 220 brigades, of which 200 are attacking the liberated areas, and 20 are guarding his rear. Now we have annihilated 70 of his brigades, which is one-third, giving Chiang Kai-shek a heavy blow. Even the many tanks, planes, and howitzers the United States gave him have been captured by us. In the past, we had no tanks and no howitzers, but now our troops have changed. Go and take a look, these are all Chiang Kai-shek's top-notch goods. Chairman Mao said to us long ago, "Chiang's army is bound to be defeated." Is it defeated now or not? (The audience shouted in unison, "Defeated!") This is Chiang Kai-shek's accumulation of more than ten years! His preparations of more than ten years have been exhausted in a few months.

    Now Chiang Kai-shek is conscripting soldiers on a large scale, even monks are being conscripted. The United States can help him with guns and cannons, but it cannot help him with people. The common people are unwilling to be soldiers and fight a civil war for him because Chiang Kai-shek is a traitor and a dictator. He does not give land to the peasants, jobs to the workers, or business to the capitalists, and he wants to put intellectuals in jail. Wen Yiduo and Li Gongpu were assassinated by Chiang Kai-shek. There are people's uprisings everywhere in Chiang Kai-shek's rear. Now, not only are our liberated areas winning battles, but the people's uprisings in Chiang Kai-shek's rear are also winning battles. Our army is one with the people, while Chiang Kai-shek's army kills the common people. Now he can only send secret agents to organize "people's service teams," like the "New People's Society," to deceive and exploit the common people. During the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, we gained democracy and implemented "land to the tiller." Chiang Kai-shek wants to betray the country and be a dictator. The people in the liberated areas have no choice but to fight, and the people in Chiang Kai-shek's areas have no choice but to fight. We are not asking to die, but asking to live. We are bound to win, this is beyond doubt. During the War of Resistance, Chiang Kai-shek hid in the mountains and did not fight. We persisted in the War of Resistance. Chairman Mao put forward three stages, and finally, we launched a counter-offensive and defeated Japan. Now Chairman Mao says, "Chiang's army is bound to be defeated," this is certain. Now three months have passed. In April, we have already begun the counter-offensive. In the future, we will launch a major counter-offensive. We will drive away American imperialism and eliminate Chiang Kai-shek. We must win, we want independence, we want freedom, we want democracy, we want production, we want family reunion.

    Now it's like boiling water, the water is almost boiling. Your arrival is like adding another handful of firewood, and the pot will boil. It's like moving a stone on the mountain, your arrival is like adding another push, and it will be moved into the sea. We are fighting to defend our homes and our land. If we don't come out to join the army and fight against Chiang Kai-shek, the Taihang Mountains will not be peaceful. In order to defend our land and defend our hometowns, we want independence, we want democracy, everyone must make another effort. You have been trained very well, now you must learn two skills: first, learn political skills. Only through struggle can we win. The land is our own, we must now struggle so that our children and grandchildren can enjoy happiness. When you get to the front, you must cherish the masses, get along well with the people, and help the newly liberated soldiers learn. The second is to further improve military skills, and become more proficient in shooting, grenade throwing, night operations, fortification construction, and various actions. You already have combat experience in the anti-Japanese guerrilla war. Learning and progressing in the actual environment at the front will be even faster. You must be as skilled as doing work at home. On behalf of the comrades at the front, I welcome you! In the past, we were able to drive away Japan and Wang Jingwei, and now we can drive away American imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek. You are the heroes who will win every battle. If we want independence, democracy, freedom, and family reunion, we must launch a major counter-offensive and fight to Chiang Kai-shek's hometown. Victory, victory, and more victory! (Nai Yi)

    [This newspaper's front line in northern Henan, 5th] General Liu Bocheng delivered a speech at a welcome meeting for the Taihang慰问团, explaining the current situation. Excerpts are as follows: Comrades,

    You are all labor heroes, enemy-killing heroes, and emancipated heroes representatives from Taihang. You are representatives of the people of Taihang. You have traveled a long way to express your cordial regards to the troops. On behalf of the frontline soldiers, I express my infinite respect.

    We are engaged in a people's liberation war, which is not only military combat, but also a war of all the people in terms of politics, economy, and culture. Although we are on different fronts, our goal of achieving victory is the same. We are fighting a comprehensive war.

    Recently, we saw from the enemy's captured materials that the enemy also recognized that our victory was due to a war of the entire population, while they were fighting a war of points. When they come to the liberated areas to fight, they are often surrounded. Now they are trying their best to turn points into planes, for the sake of a so-called "People's Service Corps" special agent organization. This so-called "People's Service Corps" and the Japanese "New People's Society" and the Chiang-controlled area's "police control" belong to the same nature. They have brought out this set of things, trying to use a war of the entire population to deal with us. However, we are a people's liberation war, striving for independence, peace, and democracy; they are a war to oppress the people, striving for dictatorship and betrayal of the country. This difference is historically determined. This is a difference in content, and the difference in content determines the difference in form. They can never achieve the goal of a war of the entire population.

    For example, you are fighting in the rear, while the people in their rear are either forced by hunger, or are captured, women are raped, and countless people are shot and killed! Even scholars such as Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo cannot escape. Therefore, everyone opposes him. This is a vivid contrast. Although there are only dozens of people in this small room, they represent tens of millions of people.

    Our region is at the forefront. It is necessary to coordinate operations in all directions, east, west, north, and south. The responsibility in the south is heavy. For nine months of combat in such a region, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and with the help of the people in the rear, it can be generally said that this region has fulfilled its due responsibility. Whose merit is this? It is the merit of the people. I and others dare not "take credit for others' achievements, and eat the food of heaven." We are just servants of the people, and we must, with the help of the people, carry forward the spirit of Chairman Mao's instructions and continue to defeat the enemy!

    In the current situation, we have eliminated 70 brigades of Chiang's army, not including the puppet army and local troops. During the Soviet era, our maximum elimination of the enemy was 20,000 people, but now we have eliminated 70 brigades. This number is indeed very large. This large-scale elimination of the enemy has created such a situation: now the enemy's main directions are Shandong and northern Shaanxi, and our side is being contained and defended. We recently annihilated three more enemy brigades and recovered more than a dozen county towns, and his secondary direction has failed. Logically, his main direction should have achieved victory; but no, Shandong previously eliminated seven brigades, and now it has eliminated three more brigades. Northern Shaanxi eliminated three brigades before and after. Both the main and secondary directions have failed. Big failures, small failures, repeated failures! As the Xinhua News Agency editorial said, the enemy is on a downward path. I say it is also a hunchback walking downhill, the trend is very steep. However, we should not be proud of this. We must continue to be conscientious and treat dead rats as if they were live cats. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, and with the help of the elders in the rear, we will move forward steadily. You are doing various kinds of work in the rear. Your achievements give us infinite encouragement. We eat what you send, we wear what you send, and your culture is our spiritual food. When we see you, we see our family, like children seeing their mother. After you go back, I hope you will tell the people in the rear that we must be more united, and strive to follow Chairman Mao's policy to defeat the enemy.
(Shen Rong)

　　欢迎新战士暨太行慰问团会上
    刘司令员畅谈战争有利形势
    【本报特讯】刘伯承将军对军区直属补充团新战士的谈话，摘要如下：
    同志们：我们今天早晨刚刚打下汤阴城，把敌人干干净净的消灭了，同志们也到了前方。
    现在我们同时看到在陕北消灭敌人两个多旅，在山东消灭敌人三个多旅，我们这里在同蒲线解放十四个县城，豫北也消灭了蒋介石的快速纵队和地方土顽三万多人，这说明四月份我们是处在反攻时期，以后是要接着大反攻下去。蒋介石一共有二百二十个旅，进攻解放区的是二百个旅，还有二十个旅在后面警戒他的后方，现在我们已经消灭了他七十个旅，就是三分之一，这给了蒋介石一个沉重的打击。就是美国给他这样多的坦克、飞机、榴弹炮，也都被我们抓过来了。过去我们没有坦克，没有榴弹炮，现在我们的队伍变了，你们都去看看，这都是蒋介石的头等货。毛主席早就对我们说：“蒋军必败”，现在败不败呀？（台下齐声喊“败！”）这是蒋介石十几年的积蓄呀！他十几年的准备几个月就完了。
    现在蒋介石又在大量抓丁，和尚也要抓来当兵，美国帮助他枪炮不能帮助他人，老百姓都不愿给他当兵打内战，因为蒋介石是卖国、是独裁，他不给农民土地，不给工人作工，不给资本家做买卖，要叫知识分子坐监牢，闻一多、李公朴就是蒋介石暗杀的，蒋介石的后方到处都有民变。现在不只我们解放区打胜仗，蒋介石后方的民变也打胜仗。我们的军队是军民一家，蒋介石的军队是杀害老百姓，他现在只有派特务组织和“新民会”一样的“人民服务队”去欺骗压榨老百姓。在八年抗日战争中，我们得到了民主，实行了耕者有其田。蒋介石要卖国要独裁，解放区的人民不打不得了，蒋介石区的人民不打也不得了，我们不是要求死而是要求活。我们是一定要胜利，这是毫无疑义的。抗战时蒋介石躲到山里不打，我们坚持抗战，毛主席提出三个阶段，最后我们反攻把日本打败了；现在毛主席说：“蒋军必败”，这是一定的。现在三月过去了，四月间我们已开始反攻，今后我们要大反攻，我们要把美国帝国主义打走，把蒋介石消灭，我们一定要胜利，我们要独立，要自由，要民主，要生产，要父母妻子团圆。
    现在好像烧水，水已快开了，你们来了就是再加把火，锅就开了。就像搬山上的石头，你们来再加一把力，就把它搬到大海里了。我们打仗是为保卫自己的家，保卫自己的土地，我们不出来参军打老蒋，太行山也不能安宁。我们为了保卫土地，保卫家乡，我们要独立，要民主，大家要再鼓一把劲。你们已经训练的很好，现在要学会两套本事：第一是学会政治本事，我们只有斗争才能胜利，土地是我们自己的，我们现在要斗争下去，使我们的子子孙孙才能享受幸福，到前方要爱护群众，和老百姓搞好，要帮助新解放的战士学习。第二更提高军事本事，把射击、投弹、夜间动作、作工事和各种动作弄得更熟练。你们在抗日游击战争中已经有了战斗经验，在前方实际学习进步更快，要和你们在家里作活一样熟练。我代表前方的同志们向你们表示欢迎！过去我们能打走日本和汪粗卫，现在就能打走美国帝国主义和蒋介石，你们才是百战百胜的英雄。我们要独立、要民主、要自由、要父母妻子团圆，我们就要大反攻，要打到蒋介石的老家去，胜利，胜利，再胜利。（乃一）
    【本报豫北前线五日电】刘伯承将军一日在欢迎太行慰问团的大会上发表演说，说明目前形势，兹摘要如下：各位同志：
    你们都是太行的劳动英雄、杀敌英雄、翻身英雄代表、太行老百姓代表们老远跑到这里来，殷勤的慰劳部队，我谨代表前线将士致无限的敬意。
    我们是人民解放战争，不仅是军事打仗，而且是政治、经济、文化各方面全体人民的战争，虽然所在的战线不同，但争取胜利是一样的。我们是全面的战争。
    最近我们从缴获敌人的材料里，看到敌人也认识了我们之所以胜利，是面的战争，他们是点的战争。他们在解放区来作战常处于包围之中。现在他们极力想把点变为面，就为了一个所谓“人民服务总队”的特务组织。这个所谓“人民服务总队”和日本人的“新民会”以及蒋管区的“警管制”属于同一性质。他们搬出这一套来，想以面的战争对付我们。然而我们是人民解放战争，争取独立、和平、民主；他们是压迫人民的战争，争取独裁卖国，这个不同点是历史特定的，这是内容上的不同，内容的不同决定了形式的不同，他们决不能达到面的战争目的。
    比如你们在后方作战，而他们后方人民或是迫于饥饿，或是被捉，妇女遭奸淫，而被枪杀的又何止千万！虽李公朴、闻一多等学者也不能幸免，因此大家都反对他，这是一个活活的对照。在这小室里虽然只有几十人，但是却代表着千千万万的人民。
    我们这个区域处在最前线。要策应东西南北各方面的作战，南面的责任重大。九个月来在这样的地域作战，在毛主席、朱总司令的领导下，在后方人民帮助下一般的说这个区域已尽了应尽的责任。这是谁的功？是老百姓的功。我和其他的人都不敢“掠人之美，食天之功”，我们只是人民的勤务员，要在人民的帮助下，发扬毛主席指示的精神，继续把敌人打倒！
    现在的形势，我们已经消灭了蒋军七十个旅，伪军地方部队还不在内。苏区时，我们消灭敌人二万人是最多的，现在却消灭了七十个旅，这个数目确是很大的。这样大量消灭敌人便造成了这样一个态势：现在敌人的主要方向是山东、陕北，对我们的这方面是牵制、防御。我们最近又歼灭敌人三个旅，收复十几个县城，他的次要方向失败了。说起来他的主要方向应该取得胜利；但是不，山东前次消灭七个旅，现在又消灭三个旅，陕北前后消灭了三个旅，主要、次要方向都失败了。大失败，小失败，回回失败！正如新华社社论所说，敌人是走下坡路，我说而且是驼子走下坡，趋势很陡。然而我们现在仍不应因此骄傲，我们仍须兢兢业业，把死老鼠当活猫打，在毛主席领导下，在后方父老的帮助下，稳步前进。你们在后方做各种工作，你们的成绩给我们无限鼓励，我们吃的是你们送来的，穿的是你们送来的，你们的文化是我们的精神食粮，我们看到你们像看到家里人，像孩子看到妈妈。回去后，希望你们告诉后方的人们，我们要更加团结一致，本毛主席的方针努力把敌人打下去。
                  （沈容）
