　　Yongxing No. 1 Factory Workers Hold
    Welcoming "May Day" Sports Week
    [This newspaper reported] The focus of Yongxing No. 1 Factory's activities in April was: "Improving quality and transforming thinking." Since April, all employees have been working vigorously towards these two goals. On April 18th, the Party, government, and labor union, in order to welcome the great festival of the workers—"May Day"—with practical actions, and to commemorate the anniversary of the Bureau's founding, specifically designated April 21st to 27th as Sports Week. It called on everyone to make further progress, whether in work or study, to welcome "May Day" and commemorate the anniversary of the Bureau's founding. Various departments and sections immediately responded, and held group meetings to discuss specific measures. By the morning of the 20th, the broadcasting station was covered with challenge and response letters. The typesetting department's challenge letter stated: "No incorrect character samples allowed, the layout must be standardized, and the title must be considered good by everyone. The cover must be beautiful and not a single word is allowed to be wrong. When returning to the typesetting area, any raised or blurred characters must be picked out..." The plate-making department wrote briefly: If the sand falls during casting, recast immediately. Plates must be deeply etched to ensure no characters are chipped off. The engraving department wrote: Ensure that the title characters are beautifully engraved and guarantee that the typesetting department's use of characters is not delayed. The entire proofreading section guarantees to clarify any unclear drafts, and not to be careless with a single word. If there are typos in the original manuscript, they are responsible for correcting them. To be even more cautious, the original manuscript must be checked during the final inspection. The final slogan is: Strive to completely eliminate typos. In terms of learning, the workers' unanimous slogan is: "As soon as the morning study bell rings, be sure to go to the study room. Discuss issues thoroughly, so that everyone's confused thoughts are cleared up. Studying culture requires being able to write, read, speak, and apply. As soon as the evening study bell rings, no workers are allowed on the streets. Do not go to sleep without the bell ringing; no rest is allowed." Proofreading section cadres pledged to help fellow workers learn.
    Over the past week, slogans have become practical actions, truly doing what is said. Every morning, before the wake-up bell rings, in the sports field, some are doing the long jump and high jump, some are playing on the parallel bars, and some are singing on the top of the mountain. As soon as the study bell rings, it's like a school, with everyone carrying stationery and books towards the study room. After breakfast, they enter the workshops like tigers descending the mountain.

　　永兴一厂职工举行
    迎接“五一”运动周
    【本报讯】永兴第一厂四月份的运动重心是：“提高质量，改造思想。”四月开始，全体职工即轰轰烈烈朝着这两个目标奋斗。四月十八日，党政工为了要以实际行动来迎接工人的伟大节日——“五一”，并纪念本局创厂周年，特订四月二十一至二十七日为运动周。号召大家不论在工作中或学习上都要更进一步的提高，来迎接“五一”，纪念本局创厂周年。而各部科立即响应，随分组开会，讨论具体办法。至二十日早上，广播台上贴满了挑战与应战书，排字部的挑战书上写着：“不改错一个签字样，版式要规矩，标题做出来要让大家认为好才算。封面美观且不准错一个字，归排字时见了高低糊字一定要检出来…………：打版部简单的写了两三句：浇版浇下沙跟马上重浇，打版要打深，保证不锄掉字；刻字部写着：保证题目字刻的美观，保证不耽误排字部用字；校对科全体意见保证把不清楚的草稿闹清楚，一字也不让马虎过去，原稿上有错字，要负责改正，为了更加慎重，检查时（即最后一次）一定要对原稿，最后口号是：向彻底消灭错字方向奋斗。在学习方面，工人们的口号一致是：“早上学习钟一响，必到学习室，讨论问题要闹彻底，使每个人的糊涂思想都要搞通，学习文化要会写、会念、会讲、会用；晚上学习钟一响，街上不准有一个工人，不打钟睡觉，不准休息。”校对科干部则提出保证帮助工友学习。
    一周来，口号已成为实际行动，真正做到怎样说就怎样作，每早不等起床钟响，运动场里，有的在跳远跳高，有的在玩双杠，有的在山顶上歌唱，学习钟一打，俨然成为一个学校，各带文具书本走向学习室，早饭后如猛虎下山一样走进了工作房。（玉宝、礼义、热）
