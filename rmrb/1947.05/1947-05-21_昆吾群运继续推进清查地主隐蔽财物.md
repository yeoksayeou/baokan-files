　　[Report from this newspaper in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region, dated 19th:] After Kunwu County proposed further developing the investigation movement, various districts held large-scale peasant meetings one after another. After half a month of mobilization and organization, the movement entered a climax, and peasants and landlords broke face, uncovering a large amount of materials. The masses in the Northwest Small District of the Third District united to conduct a surprise investigation of the big landlords in villages such as Liu Village and Liang Village, digging up more than ten dan of grain from a cotton field and finding many packages from a dung pile. The entire district investigated a total of 703 dan of grain and more than 500 pieces of clothing. When the masses were in high spirits, the slogan of investigating themselves was put forward. Li Yufeng, a female cadre from Guo Village, reported that her family had stored a large package belonging to a landlord. Immediately afterwards, many things were found in each household. In the struggle, the peasants raised their awareness and further recognized the insidious cunning of the landlords. Wang Qingxian, a hidden landlord in Shijialou who had never been struggled against, was also struggled against. The masses in Xichengzhai, in the Seventh District, uncovered the conspiracy of landlord Chen Fengting to buy off village cadre Ren Xiaofa with one dan of grain. After this matter was revealed, not only did Ren Xiaofa change, but others also woke up, reporting that they had stored 11 dan of grain and 12 packages for the landlord, and in turn, they carried out the struggle against the landlord. At this time, the masses urgently demanded the establishment of armed forces to protect their fruits. Shi Mingguang from Shijialou, Third District, said: "If you want revenge, you must have guns." Immediately afterwards, twelve youths, including Mu Wenfeng, participated. Within five or six days, the entire district developed more than 1,000 militiamen and established a joint defense leadership for the small district. From this re-investigation movement, various organizations were generally established, especially the establishment of poor peasant backbones and the extensive establishment of women's organizations. Thousands of women in the Seventh District struggled against the female landlord tyrant. The Southeast Small District of the Second District established a women's liberation committee, which divided into shifts to carry out work in Baiban Village. Women accounted for half of the more than 20,000 people at the peasant meeting in the Fourth District. The current investigation movement is continuing to deepen.

    【本报冀鲁豫十九日电】昆吾县提出进一步开展清查运动后，各区纷纷召开大规模的农民大会，动员组织半个月，即进入高潮，农民与地主揭破了脸，查出大批物资。三区西北小区群众，联合起来对刘砦、粱庄等村大地主进行突然清查，从一块棉花地里刨出十几石粮食，从粪堆里查出很多包袱。全区共计清查出七百零三石粮食，五百余件衣服。在群情高涨的时候，又提出清查自己的口号，郭庄女干部李玉峰，自报了她家存藏地主的一个大包袱，紧接着各户又查出很多东西。农民在斗争中提高了觉悟，进一步认清了地主的阴险狡猾，史家楼从未斗过的隐蔽地主王清贤也斗了。七区习城砦群众，查出了地主陈凤亭用一石粮食收买村干任小法的阴谋，把这事揭出后，不只任小法变了，其他人也醒过来，报出存地主粮食十一石，包袱十二个，反过来又进行了对地主的斗争。这时，群众迫切要求成立武装，保卫果实。三区史家楼史明光说：“要想报仇，非有枪杆子不中。”随着即有牧文方等十二青年参加，五六天内全区发展民兵达千人以上，并建立了小区联防的领导。从这次复查运动中，普遍建立了各种组织，特别树立了贫农骨干，广泛建立了妇女组织；七区千余妇女斗争了地主女恶霸，二区东南小区成立了妇女翻身委员会，分班到白板村开展工作，四区两万多人的农民大会上，妇女即占一半，现清查运动正在继续深入中。
