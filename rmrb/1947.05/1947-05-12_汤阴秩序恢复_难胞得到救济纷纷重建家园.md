　　Tangyin Order Restored
    Refugees Receive Relief and Rebuild Homes
    Ke Gang
    [Reported from the Yubei Front, May 8th by this newspaper] (Delayed) This newspaper's reporter Ke Gang reports: Within hours of the liberation of Tangyin, order in the streets was quickly restored. Our army is well-disciplined, committing no offenses, which is widely praised by the people in the city. When I visited the Yue Temple, the corpses of the Chiang Kai-shek soldiers in the city had already been buried, and the bunker fortifications in the streets and lanes had been completely destroyed by the masses. The reactionary slogans and proclamations on the walls had been scrubbed clean, and scarlet characters such as "Oppose Chiang Kai-shek's Treachery, Civil War, and Dictatorship" created a new atmosphere. Groups of men and women surrounded our soldiers, saying repeatedly, "If you hadn't entered the city, we would have jumped into the well." Many young people rushed to the city defense headquarters to report the whereabouts of major and minor traitors and special agents, the "Homecoming Corps," and hidden enemy materials and ammunition. Old Lady Wang from Dongmenli, leaning on her crutch, said to people, "When the Eighth Route Army chased Lao Sun's troops to my house, they didn't even touch a single thread of mine, and kept saying 'Don't be afraid.' This is a good army." Chang Zhishui, the owner of Tongxincheng Grocery Store in West Street, holding more than 1,000 Jichaos, pointed to the empty shelves and said to me, "If you had come three days later, you wouldn't even see these shelves. I only have 100,000 yuan of capital, and Sun Dianying's requisitions cost me 150,000 yuan in seven months. Everything was robbed by them, even the empty sacks and cargo boxes were robbed to make fortifications. When you entered the city, you were friendly and bought things without even bargaining. When you catch Sun Dianying, you must get rid of the bad seeds, and then there will be a future for business." The masses who had fled after Sun Dianying burned their houses have all received relief from the democratic government. With mixed feelings of joy and hatred, they used shovels to dig at the charred tiles and began to rebuild their homes. When I walked through Beiguan, a middle-aged woman, Chen Li's, was sitting on the foundation of her burned house, talking to the baby in her arms, "Little bastard, remember, the Eighth Route Army gave you this little life." I asked her what she meant by this sentence. She said that when Sun Dianying hit this house with sulfur bombs, an Eighth Route Army officer jumped into the fire and rescued her.

    【本报豫北前线八日电】（迟到）本报记者柯岗报导：汤阴解放后数小时内，街市秩序迅即恢复，我军纪律良好，秋毫无犯，城内群众有口皆碑。记者走访岳庙时，城内蒋军遗尸早已掩埋净尽，街巷中之地堡工事，已被群众悉数平毁，墙上的反动标语文告已经洗刷干净，“反对蒋介石卖国内战独裁”等朱红大字，造成一片新生气象，成群的男女围绕着我军战士，连声说着：“你们要再不进城，我们就要投井了。”许多青年争先恐后的跑到城防司令部去报告大小奸特、“还乡团”的踪迹，及敌军隐蔽的物资弹药等。东门里王老太太扶着拐杖对人说：“八路军追赶老孙的队伍到俺家，连俺一根线也没有动，还口口声声说着‘不要怕’，这可是好队伍。”西街小杂货铺同新成号的掌柜常志水，拿着一千多元冀钞，指着空空的货架对我说：“你们再晚三天进城，连这货架子也看不见了，我只有十万元的资本，开张七个月光孙殿英的摊派即出了十五万元，啥都被他们抢光了，连麻袋空货箱都被他们抢去做工事了，你们一进城来，和和气气的，买啥连价也不还。你们捉住了孙殿英，总要除了孬种，往后生意也有做头啦。”被孙殿英烧毁了房子而逃难回来的群众，已全部得到民主政府的救济，他们喜恨交加，用铁锹挖着焦黑的瓦砖，开始重建家屋。当我走过北关时，中年女人陈李氏正坐在他那烧毁了的房基上对着怀里的婴儿自言自语的说：“小杂种，你记着，你这条小命是八路军给你的。”我问她这句话的意思，她说当孙殿英用硫磺弹打着这座房时，一个八路军的官长，跳到火里把她抢出来的。
