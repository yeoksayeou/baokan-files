	Help Servicemen's Families with Sowing
    [This newspaper, Zuoquan dispatch] Encouraged by the good news, merchants and residents in Zuoquan City are actively helping military families and those participating in the war effort with spring plowing. The 24 public-owned shops and 31 private shops in Chengguan, first organized four large teams by the chairman of the Commercial Association based on the number of people and livestock. Each team contributed 80 laborers and 20 animals to deliver manure and sow seeds for the families of those participating in the war. At the beginning, the team leaders were responsible for allocating tasks. After the news of victory from the front came, everyone was extremely excited and immediately proposed changing the method of assistance. Instead of dispatching manpower and livestock by team, all personnel from public and private shops, except for accountants, salespersons, workers, and cooks, from managers to junior clerks, were fully mobilized, without affecting business, to sow seeds for the families of those participating in the war. Currently, more than 1,700 mu of land have been fertilized and 326 mu have been sown with yams, corn, and millet. All people and livestock are rushing to sow in the fields every day, and the progress is being communicated in letters to the militia comrades participating in the war at the front. (Zheng He)
    [This newspaper, Tunliu dispatch] Shen Jujin, manager of the Wuyuan Town Cooperative, along with Niu Yinghe and Li Chenglong, chairmen of the Commercial Association, convened a meeting of more than 100 merchants in the town on the 16th of last month, calling on merchants to serve the masses. On the spot, they discussed and organized 17 sets of livestock, and more than 100 merchants voluntarily made plans: to cultivate 50 mu of land for military families free of charge, and to plow and sow 500 mu of land at a price 20% lower than the market price. Since the 17th of last month, they have cultivated 53 mu of land for 30 military families including Li Jinhua. The masses are very satisfied with this approach. (Fu Shi)
