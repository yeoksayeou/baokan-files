Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th. TASS Moscow: Yevgeny Zhukov, a well-known Soviet journalist who recently returned from a visit to India, recently wrote an article discussing British military construction and economic policies in India. It roughly states: The Soviet delegation (i.e., the delegation attending the Pan-Asian Conference) visited the center of Hyderabad, one of India's largest princely states. The British did not conceal that they had turned this important location into a strong military base. Some of us were surprised by the small number of British officers in Delhi and Calcutta, but later, in the center of the vast territory of the Hyderabad prince, we saw an extremely concentrated presence of British soldiers. Later we understood that the transfer of most of the British armed forces to the territories of the princely states was a carefully considered plan by the British colonial authorities, because the princely states (nearly six hundred) are very favorably distributed throughout India. Moreover, these princely states constitute the most backward part of India, the part where feudal relations are most entangled. In addition, they make the princes directly subordinate to the Governor-General. This makes it easy for Britain to take military action without the knowledge of the Indian people. Many feudal princes prefer British rule because the British in the colonies never infringe on the "sacredness" of the most reactionary political and social institutions. Feudal princes have separately concluded agreements with the British authorities to transfer some British capital to the princely states. All these deployments prove to be preparations for the announced British "withdrawal" from India in 1948. Progressive people in India are extremely concerned that even if India achieves formal independence in the summer of 1948, the princely states will not only remain a base for anti-democratic forces, but also a stronghold for British power and British military control over India. Representatives of Indian public opinion often complain about the British policy of restricting the development of Indian industry: British companies do not accept machine orders from Indian enterprises or sabotage the fulfillment of orders; during the war, India supplied Britain with a large amount of goods but has not yet been paid, so India has formally become a "creditor" of Britain; Britain records India's payments as pound sterling accounts, but this account is "frozen" in London, and the "creditor" cannot dispose of it. Therefore, India is deprived of working capital and cannot purchase goods anywhere outside the UK. This situation aggravates India's economic dependence and helps consolidate Britain's almost monopoly position in the Indian market. Although Britain has promised to "withdraw" from India, its true intention is to lead India to the fate of the Philippines.

### 英国无意从印度撤退　驻印军队散布各土邦

　　英国无意从印度撤退
  　驻印军队散布各土邦
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：新近访印归来之苏联名记者叶夫根尼·朱可夫，顷撰文论述英国在印度的军事建设与经济政策。略称：苏联代表团（按即出席泛亚洲会议代表团）曾拜访印度最大土邦之一的海德拉巴的中心，英国人毫不隐讳把这个重要地点变为他们的坚强的军事基地。我们之中有些人诧异于德里和加尔各答英国军官为数之少，可是后来在海德拉巴王公广大领地的中心，却看到英国军人极端集中的情景。稍后我们明白了，大部分英国武装部队转移到土邦的领地内是英国殖民当局一个经过缜密考虑的计划，因为各土邦（差不多有六百个）非常有利的分布在全印。而且，这些土邦构成了全印最落后的部分，封建关系最纠缠不清的部分；此外，他们又把王公们直接隶属于总督之下。这使得英国很容易瞒着印度人民而采取军事行动。很多封建王公宁愿英国统治，因为英国人在殖民地永远不侵犯最反动的政治及社会机构的“神圣”。封建王公分别与英国当局成立协定，转移部分英国资本到土邦。所有这些部署，都证明是为己宣布的英国人在一九四八年从印度“撤退”作准备。印度进步人士极耽心：即使印度在一九四八年夏天得到形式上的独立，各土邦不仅仍旧是反民主力量的基地，而且仍旧是英国势力及英国军事控制印度的堡垒。印度舆论的代表常常控诉英国束缚印度工业发展的政策：英国公司不接受印度企业的机器定货或对定货的履行实行怠工；战时印度曾供给英国大量货物而迄今仍未付款，因此印度形式上变成了英国的“债权人”；英国将印度的货款记成英镑账目，而这笔账目却被“冻结”在伦敦，“债权人”不能够处理它。因此印度便被剥夺了流通资金而不能够在英国以外的任何地方购买货物，这种情形加重了印度经济的依赖性，并且帮助巩固英国货物在印度市场上几乎独占的地位。英国虽允诺将自印“撤退”，但其真实意图是在使印度走向菲律宾的命运。
