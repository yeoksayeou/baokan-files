Xinhua News Agency, Zhengtai Front, 29th: After liberating Meng County, the People's Liberation Army of Jin-Cha-Ji liberated Pingding City, 80 li southwest of Niangziguan, on the morning of the 27th. The results of the battle are being verified. This is the fifth county seat liberated by the People's Liberation Army of Jin-Cha-Ji in April.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 28th: In order to save the fate of the Chiang army in Shijiazhuang from being annihilated, the Chiang Kai-shek's Baoding Pacification Headquarters urgently drew three divisions and one brigade from the Pinghan and Jinpu lines: the 130th Division and 131st Division of the 53rd Army, the 121st Division of the 94th Army, and the 95th Brigade of the Reorganized 62nd Division, totaling three divisions and one brigade. They advanced southward along the Pinghan Line from Baoding on the 24th. However, fearing annihilation by the People's Liberation Army, their progress was extremely slow. As of the 27th, they were still blocked on the line of Zhangdeng, Ranhetou, and Shiwuji south of Baoding. Wangdu County and Fangshunqiao to its north are still in the hands of the People's Liberation Army of Jin-Cha-Ji. The Central News Agency's claims of "recovering Wangdu," "recovering Ding County," and "joining forces with Shijiazhuang" are all daydreaming.

　　我军解放平定
    保定敌南犯被阻不前
    【新华社正太前线二十九日电】晋察冀人民解放军继解放盂县后，复于二十七日晨解放娘子关西南八十里之平定城，战果正清查中。此为晋察冀人民解放军四月份以来解放之第五座县城。
    【新华社晋察冀二十八日电】为挽救石家庄蒋军被歼命运，蒋记保定绥署急自平汉、津浦两线抽调五十三军之一三零师、一三一师、九十四军之一二一师及整六十二师之九十五旅，共三个师一个旅，于二十四日自保定沿平汉线南犯。但惧怕为人民解放军歼灭，进展极缓。截至二十七日仍被阻于保定以南张登、冉河头、十五计一线。望都县及其以北之方顺桥仍在晋察冀人民解放军之手。中央社所称之“收复望都”、“收复定县”、“将与石家庄会师”云云，全为白日梦呓。
