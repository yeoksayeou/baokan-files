　　Ren Village Adjusts Near-Ground Organization Strength to Overcome Drought and Expand Cotton Planting
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] The masses in Ren Village, Lin County, based on the united and conscious adjustment of land, have victoriously completed the rush planting of 166 mu of cotton fields, and are now striving to rush plant all the cotton. The masses in this village had no habit of planting cotton. Before the war, the cotton land was at most 60 mu. The year before last it was 80 mu. After vigorous promotion by the leadership, last year the cotton planting area suddenly increased to 264 mu. The masses truly realized the truth of "first cotton, second hemp, third sesame" from practical interests. Especially after the recent review and mutual adjustment to thoroughly complete the land reform, the enthusiasm of the masses for planting cotton has been unprecedentedly high. Almost every family is setting aside land for planting cotton, totaling 530 mu this year, which is about double the cotton planting area last year. Since the beginning of summer, there has been a lack of rain. Under the leadership of activists and production models such as Hu Jingsheng, a member of the Border Region Council, and Lu Fu, the head of the mutual aid group, as of the 13th of this month, the rush planting of 166.5 mu of cotton fields has been completed. In addition to trying to water and plant the remaining 364 mu of cotton land, they are also uniformly adjusting the white land closest to the water source (about 20 mu) to plant cotton, with the street and mutual aid group as a unit. In addition, they are calling for widespread seedling cultivation. The masses have little confidence in the latter method due to lack of experience, so they are inspired to recall: How did we plant cotton last year when we had never planted it before? Why could we not plant cotton without rain in the past, but we can plant it this time? Clarify the truth that "man can conquer nature", and under the slogan of "no planting after Small Full, no seedlings left after Grain in Ear," carry out a small-scale rush seedling cultivation movement. In order to solve the contradiction between planting and eating water, the masses in the folk school decided that the west slope should pick the water from the south and north wave ponds for planting, the north of the village should pick the water from the Shigan pond for planting, and the wells in the village, in addition to providing drinking water for the village, should also provide a large amount of water for the passing war participants and the wounded, and it is strictly forbidden to water the flowers with the wells in the village. In order to solve the labor shortage, semi-laborers and auxiliary laborers are absorbed to participate in planting, with specific division of labor: male laborers only manage water carrying, topping ten points; women and children are responsible for climbing kilns, watering, and planting seeds, topping seven points. In order to take care of military families and war participants, one of the conditions for the mutual aid group competition is to see if the military families and war participants have planted flowers? Lu Fu's mutual aid group on Second Street gave priority to planting the flower fields of three military families and two militia families in his group.

　　任村调剂近地组织力量
    战胜天旱扩大植棉
    【本报讯】林县任村群众在团结自觉调剂土地的基础上，胜利完成了一百六十六亩棉田的突击点种工作，现正设法为抢种全部棉花而奋斗。该村群众向无植棉习惯，战前棉地至多六十亩，前年为八十亩，经领导上大力提倡，去年植棉面积突增至二百六十四亩。群众从实际利益中，真正体会到“一花、二麻、三芝麻”的道理，尤其是，经过最近一段复查，互相调剂，彻底完成土地改革后，群众植棉的热情空前高涨，几乎没有一家不腾出土地种花，共计今年留的花地为五百卅亩，约等于去年植棉面积一倍。立夏以来缺雨，在边区参议员胡景生、互助组长卢富等积极分子、生产模范领导下，截至本月十三日，业已完成一百六十六亩五分棉田的突击点种工作。余下的三百六十四亩花地除尽量挑水点种外，并以街以互助组为单位，统一调剂靠水最近的白地（约廿亩）种花，此外便号召普遍养苗。后一种办法，群众因无经验，信心不大，便启发大家回想：咱过去没种过花去年怎种起来的？过去离雨不能种花，这回为啥能种了？明确“人能胜天”的道理，并在“小满不种、芒种不留”的口号下，开展小片突击养苗运动。为了解决点种与吃水的矛盾，经群众在民校讨论后特规定西坡地挑南北浪池的水点种，村北地挑石岗池的水点种，村内水井，除供本村吃喝，还要供给过往参战人员、伤病员大量的水，一律禁止以村内井浇花。为了解决劳力困难，吸收半劳力及辅助劳力参加点种，具体分工为男劳力光管挑水，顶十分；妇女、儿童负责攀窑、浇水、点籽，顶七分。为照顾军属及参战人员，互助组竞赛的条件之一便是看给军属参战人员种上花没有？二街卢富的互助组，尽先将他组内三户军属、二户民兵的花地种上了。
