Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th: The United States is intensifying its expansion into Egypt, excluding British influence, and attempting to control the Suez Canal and the Mediterranean region. According to a TASS report: The diplomatic correspondent of the London weekly "City Observer" recently wrote an article exposing that the US government is preparing to lend Egypt 25 million British pounds for defense expenditures, and plans to send experts to Egypt to assist in drafting a Suez Canal defense plan. The United States has suggested and expressed its willingness to help open another canal through Egyptian Sudan and French Africa, linking Lake Tanganyika to the mouth of the Niger River, in order to reduce the heavy traffic on the Suez Canal. This loan plan is the result of a recent visit by an Egyptian military delegation to the United States and has already attracted significant attention. Well-informed sources in Washington are discussing the possibility of indirect American control of the Suez Canal, which would gradually subjugate Egypt to American rule, and this rule would be strengthened in the Mediterranean region.

　　美加紧向埃及扩张
    图控制苏彝士运河
    【新华社陕北十二日电】美国加紧向埃及扩张，排斥英国势力，企图控制苏彝士运河与地中海区域。据塔斯社讯：伦敦《城市观察家》周报外交记者顷著文揭露：美国政府近准备贷予埃及以二千五百万英磅，供埃及作为国防之经费，并拟派专家赴埃协助起草苏彝士运河防务计划。美国建议并表示愿与帮助，即经过埃及苏丹和法属菲洲开凿另一条运河，以联系坦葛尼喀湖至尼日尔河口，以减少苏彝士运河的频繁运输。此一贷款计划系由于埃及军事代表团最近访问美国的结果，业已引起重大的注意。华盛顿的消息灵通人士们正谈论着美国间接控制苏彝士运河的可能，这将使埃及逐渐沦于美国统治之下，而且这种统治还将加强于地中海区域。
