　　People's Paper Mill Competition for Production
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 29th dispatch] The Gaoping People's Paper Mill has launched a campaign to dedicate work and money to accelerate production in support of the front lines. On the 12th of this month, all employees discussed the dedication of work and the major production competition. Worker Fan Yaohua took the lead by donating 1,000 yuan, Wang Xicao donated a set of clothes, and other workers donated 1,000 or 10,000 yuan each, totaling 154,300 yuan. After the meeting, worker Cui Dongcheng did not sleep well all night, repeatedly thinking about the brothers on the front lines risking their lives to fight the enemy to defend the people. He said, "What does it matter if we sweat a little more every day?" The next day, he proposed to the factory director that he would take five days' less wages each month, using the work of five workers to support the front lines. Cui Dequan, a paper dryer, is someone who had just been liberated. He thought about the past and present of his family and announced that he would dedicate one month of work to the front lines. Wang Xiaochou, on behalf of all the workers in the group, guaranteed to increase production by 50 sheets of paper every four days. Finally, all the workers jointly formulated a production increase plan and launched a production competition.
    [This newspaper, Pingshun dispatch] The Yumin Paper Mill in the Fourth District launched a movement to save and dedicate work. The factory has a total of 34 people, who can save 136 jin per month, worth 10,880 yuan at market prices. In terms of dedicating work, Li Fuxi donates two days of voluntary labor each month, Wei Yiming donates three days of work, for a total of 48 and a half days of voluntary labor from the entire factory, worth 17,540 yuan in wages. Including food savings, the total is 28,420 yuan per month, which will continue until Chiang Kai-shek is defeated. On the same day, the entire factory also formulated a production plan, requiring five more districts of paper to be produced every day, and organized a competition committee, with pool versus pool challenges. A small summary will be made on May 1st, and a major summary on August 1st, and the competition is now underway in great excitement. (Jianchang, Deming)
