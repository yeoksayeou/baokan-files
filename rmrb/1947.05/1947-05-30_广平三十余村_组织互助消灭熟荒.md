　　Guangping Thirty-odd Villages
　　Organize Mutual Aid to Eliminate Cultivated Wasteland
　　[Reported from Southern Hebei, 28th] In more than thirty villages in the Pingyidian and Hangu areas of the first district of Guangping, and the Nanhancun and Nanyan areas of the second district, there are still 450 hectares of wasteland that has been uncultivated for three to five years. The masses want to cultivate it but cannot. In order to solve the difficulties of eliminating wasteland for the masses, the cadres of the first and second districts held a special meeting to study the following methods: 1. Organize mutual aid, mobilize the masses to buy cattle together, freely pair up, men turn the soil, and women and children collect grass. Integrate war service and production closely, and implement work-point exchange. 2. Regulate livestock power, using a combination of mobilization, persuasion, and administrative power organization. Villages without wasteland can come to help cultivate, stipulating certain remuneration, and returning the labor in the fall. 3. Concentrate all efforts to reduce unnecessary meetings. 4. Lands of those who fled the famine and have not returned, and lands of households without successors, should be distributed to the masses as much as possible, and can be managed by the government on their behalf, to solve the problem of livestock difficulties for the masses. Currently, cadres have been dispatched to the villages to carry out mobilization and organization.

  　组织互助消灭熟荒
    【本报冀南二十八日电】广平一区平意店、韩固；二区南韩村、南盐池等三十余村，尚有荒地四百五十顷，荒的时间三年、五年不等，群众想开没法开。一、二区干部为给群众解决消灭荒地的困难，特集会研究出以下办法：一、组织互助，发动群众合伙买牛，自由搭配，男的翻土，妇女小孩拾草。战勤和生产紧密结合，实行计工换工。二、调剂畜力，用动员说服结合行政力量组织，没荒地的村可来助耕，规定一定报酬，秋后还工。三、集中一切力量减少不必要的会。四、逃荒未归及绝户土地，尽量分给群众，可由政府代管，给群众解决牲口困难。现干部已分头下村进行动员组织。
