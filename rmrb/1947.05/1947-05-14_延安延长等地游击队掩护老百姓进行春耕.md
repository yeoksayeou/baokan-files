Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 12th. Guerrilla forces in Yan'an, Yanchang, and other places, from late March to the end of April, have stopped the enemy more than 60 times. In addition to killing and wounding 17 enemy soldiers below the company commander level, they captured nearly 200 enemy personnel including a deputy battalion commander and plainclothes agents. Small groups of enemies consisting of one squad or one platoon now dare not come out to loot. The people in various places are carrying out spring ploughing under the tense protection of the guerrilla forces. The Yanxi Guerrilla Detachment is dispatched almost every day, and in the 16 battles in April alone, they killed or wounded 10 enemies, captured 60 alive, and seized two artillery pieces and 16 rifles. Among them, in an ambush in Suojia Cliff on April 2, they captured six enemy personnel alive including Liu Kechang, the adjutant of the enemy artillery battalion, seized three Mauser rifles, two mules, two gun carriages, and four horses. In mid-April, the guerrilla forces burned down an enemy plane that had crashed in Wangzhuang. The guerrilla forces in the Fengfu area laid landmines in the Lijiachu area and destroyed two cars. The Yanchang Guerrilla Force attacked the enemy seven times in nine days from March 28 to April 5, capturing more than 100 enemy stragglers and plainclothes agents alive, killing seven enemy soldiers below the company commander level, and seizing a radio station, 42 mules and horses, and more than 70 bags of foreign flour. Now, with the protection of the guerrilla forces and work teams, most of the masses in the suburbs of Yan'an City have returned to their villages to settle down and engage in production. Each village has established a rotation system for mountain sentries, communication signals have been established between villages, and mutual aid teams have been universally organized to actively rush to plant miscellaneous fields such as hemp, millet, and beans.
