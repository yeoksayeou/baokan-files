Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 16th: The Mongolian people's guerrilla forces in the Inner Mongolian grasslands of Chahar and Xilin Gol Leagues are bravely striking against Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandit troops. In March alone, they defeated Fu bandits 16 times, killing 46 bandits including platoon leaders and below, capturing 18 pseudo-village chiefs and below, and seizing 28 war horses. They recovered more than 200 large carts of fodder and more than 200 cattle and sheep that had been looted from the masses, and successively recovered three strongholds and more than 40 villages in Duolun's Shandian River, Baochang's Huluyu, and Guyuan's Xiaohezi (i.e., the old Guyuan city). In January of this year, the local guerrilla forces of Taolin County (belonging to eastern Suiyuan) in Chahar League, in coordination with the People's Liberation Army, recovered Honggeertu, defeated Fu's troops, seized more than 50 guns, and liberated more than 500 young men who had been forcibly conscripted by Fu. The Fu bandits cruelly plundered and killed the Mongolian and Han people. In Tongshengyong, a small village in Duolun, more than 120 stones of naked oats were looted, and more than 20 young adults were seized. The people in the recovered areas strongly launched revenge and liquidation struggles. Lamas in the East Sunite League also participated in the security team for armed self-defense. A Mongolian youth in the area joined the army and dedicated all of his family property, 50 horses, to the People's Army, declaring that he would not return home until Chiang Kai-shek was defeated.
