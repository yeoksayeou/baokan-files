　　Tunliu District Chief Meeting Decides
　　Village Funds for Self-Sufficiency in Production
　　[This newspaper, Taiyue, 7th dispatch] Tunliu held a meeting of district chiefs last month, at which it was decided that village funds should be self-sufficient through production. All expenses of village offices, primary schools, and village military committees will be solved through village production, and no more levies will be collected from the masses. The direction of production will mainly focus on the combination of agriculture and sideline industries, based on the actual conditions of each village. Those who can cultivate land should do so, or raise funds to open and invest in small factories, workshops, transportation, etc. Commercial speculation is absolutely prohibited. The source of funds can be the auction and sale of village public property, or 20% can be drawn from the cleared-up old funds. In the future, only dividends will be spent, not the principal. If individual villages do not have the above conditions, they can specifically plan the amount of funds needed when hoarding grain in summer and autumn, and collect funds with the approval of the county. A circular has been issued to each village to study and carry out production.
　　[This newspaper dispatch] Since the Chiang army's attack on Linfen County, the financial expenditures of various villages have been quite chaotic. Yuebi Village exceeded the public grain burden by more than 10%. The situation in other villages is roughly the same. In order to eliminate waste, practice thrift, and strive for victory in the patriotic self-defense war, the county government specially issued a circular to each village: 1. The past expenditures of each village should be announced to the masses in a list within ten days, and be effective only after being discussed and approved by the mass meeting and submitted to the district office for forwarding to the county government for approval and record. 2. From April onwards, any excessive spending in villages, in addition to the stipulated expenditures, must be stopped, otherwise it will be regarded as corruption! Special expenditures must be explained by the village office and submitted to the district office for review and comments, and then submitted to the county government for approval and implementation. 3. Surplus grain and funds should be handed over to the county and should not be spent or borrowed arbitrarily. At the same time, in order to respond to the superior's call for production and thrift, under the leadership of County Chief Liu, everyone unanimously demanded to reduce clothing and food and support the patriotic self-defense war, ensuring that everyone cultivates one to two mu of land, raises chicks, grinds their own flour, and uses labor to reduce the burden on the people. The savings in affairs are exchanged for towels and toothbrushes, and comrades who have made achievements in production and thrift are rewarded.

　　屯留区长会议决定
    村款生产自给
    【本报太岳七日电】屯留于上月举行各区长会议时，决定村款开支生产自给办法。村公所、小学校、村武委会一切开支均由各村生产解决，不再向群众征收。生产方向以农副业结合为主，根据各村实际情况，能种地的种地，或筹资开设与投资小型工厂、作坊、运输等，绝对禁止商业投机。资金来源可将村公产拍卖变价，或在清理出的旧款中提出百分之二十，今后只开支红利，不开支基金。如有个别村没有以上条件，可在夏秋囤粮时，由村具体计划需要基金数额，经县批准，征集资金。现已通令各村研究进行生产。
    【本报讯】临汾县自蒋军进攻以来，各村财政开支颇为混乱，岳壁村超过公粮负担百分之十还多。其他各村和上述情形也大体相同。为杜绝浪费，厉行节约，争取爱国自卫战争的胜利，县政府特通令各村：一、各村过去的开支，应于十日内向群众公布清单，经群众大会讨论通过，并呈区公所转呈县府批准备案后，方为有效。二、自四月份起，各村、闾除按规定开支外，其他任何滥支现象，一律停止，否则以贪污论！特殊开支，得由村公所陈明理由呈区公所审查后提出意见，转呈县政府批准执行。三、余粮余款交县，不准乱支乱借。同时，为了响应上级的生产节约号召，在刘县长的领导下，大家一致要求节衣缩食，支援爱国自卫战争，保证每人要种地一亩到二亩，并喂小鸡，自己磨面，用劳动的方法来减轻人民的负担。事务上把节余下的东西，换些毛巾牙刷，对生产节约有成绩的同志，进行奖励。
