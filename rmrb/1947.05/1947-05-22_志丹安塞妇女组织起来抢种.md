Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 19th—Working women in Zhidan and Anse areas are organizing themselves to participate in spring plowing and rush planting. In the fifth township of the first district of Zhidan, 30 percent of the women have gone to the mountains, and 1,200 mu of summer and autumn crops have been planted in the entire township. The wife of Ren Shechang from Wangcun gets up before dawn every day to help her husband plant seeds and spread fertilizer. When they return, the husband carries firewood, and the woman drives the donkey carrying firewood. When Wu Huaming was sick, his wife started digging the ground and planted more than six mu of land, influencing other women to participate in spring plowing and production. In the first township of Anse Ren District, in addition to men, women, old and young, working together to rush planting, the women of Laozhuang Village also organized two groups to specifically support all passing errands, so that men can reduce lost work time and focus on production.

　　志丹安塞妇女组织起来抢种
    【新华社西北十九日电】志丹、安塞一带劳动妇女，纷纷组织起来参加春耕抢种。志丹一区五乡已有百分之三十的妇女上山，全乡已种一千二百亩夏秋庄稼。王村任社常的老婆，每天天刚亮就上山帮助男人点籽、撒粪，回来时男人担柴，女人赶着驮柴的毛驴。吴华明病了他女人就动手挖地，下种六亩多，并影响了其他妇女也参加春耕生产。安塞任区一乡群众，除男女老幼一齐动手抢种外，老庄村妇女还组织起两小组，专门支应一切过往差事，使男人减少误工，全力生产。
