　　Buying Back Livestock in Large Quantities
    Solving Labor Shortages
    Lucheng Fourth District Cadres Determined to Step Up Leadership in Production
    [Report from Lucheng by this newspaper] The Fourth District convened a conference of 1,570 activists from the entire district on April 19th to mobilize for large-scale production. The meeting first raised the following issues: After the emancipation movement, farmers obtained more than 10,000 mu of land from the landlords. The district averaged six mu of land per person. However, there were 41 coal and pottery kilns nearby, employing nearly 3,000 workers. In addition, people joined the army and participated in the war. Some villages felt a lack of labor. For example, Dongwang Village originally had 147 laborers, but now only has 32 laborers after deducting those who joined the army, participated in the war, and became workers. Each person farms an average of 150 mu of land. Therefore, cadres and the masses thought that there would be a labor shortage this year, making farming difficult. In addition, sideline production earned a lot of money last winter and this spring. For example, Xigou Village, with over a hundred households, earned over 2 million yuan in transportation alone this year. Therefore, most people felt that engaging in sideline production was more profitable than engaging in agricultural production. After discussion, the activists all believed that it was wrong to despise agriculture and rely solely on sideline production. After active guidance from the leadership, the slogan "All things are born from the soil; land is the lifeblood of farmers; a good life relies on labor" was proposed. After discussion, the masses said, "Although sideline production earns money, don't forget the famine years." The village chief of Podi Village said, "Workers and merchants rely on farmers; without millet, they go hungry. Agriculture is the foundation, and sideline production is the branch. Agriculture should be the main focus, and sideline production should supplement it. Farming three and saving one guarantees a surplus." The labor shortage issue was also resolved after calculation. For example, the village chief of Podi Village said, "Although we lack labor, we increased our livestock by 30 heads last year. One head of livestock is equivalent to two and a half laborers. Thirty heads of livestock are equivalent to 70 laborers. Calculating it this way, there is no labor shortage." Some said that hoeing was not a worry, and women and children could pull seedlings. Although there was a labor shortage, the number of livestock could be greatly increased. Furthermore, more precise calculations were made, and specific division of labor was used to save labor. Therefore, the form of mutual aid teams must be implemented throughout the village. Only in this way can the difficulty of labor shortage be overcome. After this discussion, everyone had great confidence. They discussed the production plan for the first half of the year, and the villages launched challenges and competitions with each other. Everyone was determined to carry out the production movement with the spirit of leading the emancipation movement. (Xingfu, Shouyi, Xiangzheng, Renfu, Wucheng, Depei)

　　大量买回牲畜
    解决劳力困难
    潞城四区干部决心加油领导生产
    【本报潞城讯】四区于四月十九号，召开全区积极分子一五七零人的大会，动员大生产。会议中首先提出了以下的问题：经过翻身运动，农民从地主手中获得土地一万余亩，全区每人平均种地六亩，但附近有煤，缸窑四十一处，参加工人近三千人，加之参战参军，有些村感到劳力缺乏，如东旺村原有劳力一百四十七个，除参军参战当工人外，现仅有劳力三十二个，每人平均种地一百五十亩，因此干部群众在思想上都认为：今年劳力缺乏，种地是个困难问题。另外去冬今春副业生产很赚钱，如百余户的西沟村在今年光运输赚洋二百余万元。因此大部群众觉得搞副业生产比搞农业生产赚钱。经群众积极分子讨论都认为轻视农业专靠副业是错误的，经过领导上的积极引导，提出：万物本是土中生，地是农民活命根，过好时光靠劳动的口号，经讨论后群众说：“副业生产虽赚钱，不要忘了灾荒年。”坡底村长说：“工人商人靠农民，没有小米饿肚子，农业是根本，副业是枝梢，农业要为主，副业来补充，耕三余一有保证。”劳力缺乏问题经过计算也得到解决，如坡底村长说：“我们劳力虽缺乏，但去年增加了牲口三十头，一个牲口能顶两个半劳力用，三十个牲口能顶七十个劳力。这样一算，劳力就不缺乏了。”有的说锄地不发愁，妇女儿童拔苗，劳力虽缺乏，牲口可大大增加。更进一步又作了精确计算，使用劳力具体分工，才能节省劳力，因此互助组的形式必须实行全村大变工，只有这样才能克服缺乏劳力的困难。经过这样讨论，大家都抱着高度的信心，讨论了前半年的生产计划，各村并相互开展了挑战竞赛，大家决心以领导翻身运动的精神来开展生产运动。（兴福、守一、向正、仁富、武城、得裴）
