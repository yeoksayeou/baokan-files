[Jinan Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 28th] Ten thousand peasants from Nangong carried shoulder poles, and six thousand peasants rushed to the front lines in northern Henan. On May 9th, after Nangong received a mission from the division headquarters for 500 stretchers (second phase), it was decided that County Chief Yang Ziyan would serve as the head of the brigade, County Party Committee Shi Qingyun would serve as the political commissar, Salvation Association Director Jiang Feng would serve as the political director, and Public Security Deputy Bureau Chief Kong Yingjie would serve as the chief of staff. Three thousand emancipated peasants, forming 520 stretchers, departed for the front lines on the 1st. The Qiu County militia had participated in six expeditions, and during the fierce struggle against the enemy on the Yuan Dynasty Wei River, they were awarded a flag by the Seventh Division Headquarters. Recently, they were ordered to participate in the seventh expedition, and everyone's enthusiasm was even higher, determined to make great contributions. Chen Lin and Ma Xianting had just returned from Xingtai selling mats when they heard about the call to war. They said, "Participating in the war is a major event, selling mats is a minor matter, we won't even settle the accounts, we'll complete the mission and sell them when we return." Li Chunhe from Si Sheng Village in the Fourth District is an old hero who has participated in six expeditions and has been awarded a major commendation once. His family was building a house, but when he heard about the call to war, he said, "We won victories in all six expeditions, so I must go this time as well." The masses of Qi Zhi enthusiastically supported the front lines. The entire county has milled one million jin of rice, transported 500,000 jin of rice and flour, dispatched 500 stretchers, woven 20,000 bolts of military cloth, and made 7,000 pairs of military shoes. When the stretcher mission came to Hexi Village, the village chiefs scrambled to sign up, saying, "The Farmers' Association Director made contributions by participating in the emancipation team, so it's my turn to make contributions this time."
    
[Dispatch from the Northern Henan Front, from Our Newspaper, 27th] During the Northern Henan Campaign, 50,000 people in Anyang County participated in the war. In the initial ten days of the campaign, 20,000 people built three highways with a total length of × hundred li. In terms of transporting grain, 4,550,000 jin of grain were supplied to the front-line troops in just one month. At the three supply stations in the county, an average of 500 livestock and over 650 people participated in transportation every day. More than 4,000 people in the county organized 700 stretchers. The masses in various villages organized nine reception stations to receive the wounded. In addition to assisting the troops with combat support work, 400 of the 1,300 militiamen in various districts also organized two capture teams to capture Chiang Kai-shek's puppet personnel and secret agent landlords in the war zone, helping to stabilize social order and recover a large number of "overturned account" supplies. Capture hero Liu Jichang led 30 militiamen and captured 80 secret agents in the Anyang Bridge area north of Anyang City in two days, transporting back six large carts of "overturned account" supplies.
