　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th. The soaring price wave that has once again swept through the large and small cities in the Jiang-controlled areas, both north and south, has plunged Chiang Kai-shek's "reorganized government" into a state of panic and unease. Markets are chaotic, and people are panic-stricken, which is even more serious than the Jin Chao-induced situation in February. According to Pingjin newspapers: By the 29th of last month, flour had risen to 320,000 yuan per bag, and rice had reached 3,500 yuan per jin. Other items have also skyrocketed, changing several times a day. The black market is rampant, and all "price limits," "negotiated prices," and "investigations" are completely ineffective. According to the Central News Agency: Rice shops and grain stores in Hangzhou went on strike on the 2nd to protest the Jiang government's price limits, and then the grain was抢夺一空 by citizens. People in Zhushan, Yunxian, Yunxi, Junxian, Zhuxi and other counties in Hubei province have begun to starve to death in large numbers due to soaring grain prices, which has made life unsustainable. Teachers in large, medium, and small schools in various places have gone on strike one after another, demanding improved treatment. Professors at National Henan University and Qingdao University went on strike yesterday and the day before, and firmly declared that they would not return to teaching until their treatment was improved. Faculty and staff of primary and secondary schools in Qingdao held a meeting and decided to take united action; professors at universities in Shanghai are also brewing a strike. Zhang Qun, the new administrative president of the Jiang regime, who is determined to sell out the country and wage a civil war, publicly declared that he was helpless in the face of this difficult situation. At a meeting of the Jiang-controlled Legislative Yuan on the 1st, he desperately wailed: "Government problems cannot be solved, and it is impossible to stabilize the economy." He believes that the "economic emergency measures" announced by Chiang Kai-shek in February were of no avail. The more profound economic crisis that came with Chiang Kai-shek's "reorganized government" once again affirmed the Chiang Kai-shek clique's inevitable fate of being crushed by the crisis in the end.

　　蒋政府“改组”后物价暴涨
    市民抢粮教授罢教
    张群公开宣告束手无策
    【新华社陕北五日电】物价暴涨风潮再度席卷蒋官区南北各大小城市，已使蒋介石的“改组的政府”陷入惊慌不安之窘境。各地市场紊乱，人心惶恐，较二月间由金潮所引起者尤为严重。据平津报载：至上月二十九日，麦粉每袋已涨至卅二万元，大米每斤三千五百元。其他物品也都飞涨，一日数变，黑市猖獗，一切“限价”、“议价”、“缉查”完全无效。另据中央社透露：杭州米店粮行二日全部罢市，抗议蒋政府之限价，旋又为市民将粮食抢夺一空。湖北竹山、郧县、郧西、均县、竹溪等县人民，因粮价飞涨，无法生活，开始大批饿死。各地大中小学教员，则纷纷罢教，要求改善待遇。国立河南大学及青岛大学教授已自昨前二日全体罢教，并坚决声明，待遇不改善绝不复教。青岛中小学教职员开会决议采取一致行动；上海各大学教授也正在酝酿罢教中。以坚决卖国内战为己任的蒋记新任行政院长张群对此一难关，公开宣告束手无策，于一日蒋记立法院会议上，曾力竭声嘶的悲号：“政府问题不能解决，欲稳定经济实不可能。”对于二月间蒋介石宣布之“经济紧急措施方案”则认为无济于事。伴随着蒋介石“改组政府”同来的更加深刻的经济危机，再次肯定蒋介石集团最后只有被危机压得粉碎的不可挽回的命运。
