[This report from our Taiyue correspondent on the 7th] The cadres of North Slope Village in Jincheng are leading the masses in production, and the village office has moved to the fields to work. After the village chief, Wu Haiyun, accepted the superior's production call in the spring of the year before last, he divided the entire village population into groups of five households to carry out mutual aid. But in less than twenty days, the whole thing fell apart. Last spring, the government again called for organization, and the district committee secretary came down and introduced the experience of the Songhe mutual aid team. The village chief then sent San Shun, Ping Ding, Shen Zhi, and Shun Chuan to Songhe to help with the busy work and learn their methods. Three days later, they returned with their skills, understanding the principle of voluntary association. Thus, the mutual aid team changed its course, establishing a democratic system in which all issues had to be discussed within the group. After finishing work each day, they would evaluate the work and record points at the edge of the field, paying wages on the spot with work tickets. This improved everyone's enthusiasm, and the work was done quickly and well. In addition to handling urgent official business, the village chief also labored with everyone from time to time, not only completing his own twelve mu of land through mutual labor but also earning a good amount of wages. This spring, during the rush to plant, all the village cadres participated in the mutual aid teams, moving the village office to the fields. Wu Haiyun said, "Wherever I go, the village office is there. When there are major events, the cadres hold meetings at night to determine the methods, and then they go to the mutual aid teams to handle them during the day." Problems among the masses are first resolved within the mutual aid teams. If they cannot be resolved, the village cadres bring their farm tools to other teams, resolving the issues while working. In addition, the village is on the Tongqinghua Highway, and injured soldiers from the army pass through every day. The village office has specially assigned two stretcher teams to provide services, with the stretcher-bearers first helping others with odd jobs by the roadside and immediately setting off when something happens, saving a lot of manpower.

　　村干全部参加互助
    北坡村公所地里办公
    【本报太岳七日电】晋城北坡村干部带领群众生产，村公所搬到地里办公。该村村长吴海云在前年春季接受上级生产号召后，曾将全村人口按五户编为一组，进行互助。但不到二十天，全盘散伙了。去年春天政府又号召组织起来，区分委书记下来介绍了宋河互助组的经验，村长便叫三顺、平定、伸直、顺传四人到宋河去打忙工，学习人家的办法。三天后，学好本领回来，懂得自愿结合的原则。于是互助组便改弦更张，建立了一套民主制度，任何问题都得经过组内讨论，每天做完活后就在地边评工记分，当下付工票，如此提高了大家情绪，活做得又快又好。村长除办紧要公事外，也时时和大家一块劳动，不但把自己的十二亩地变工做完，还赚不少工资。今春突击耕种时，村干部全部参加互助组，将村公所也搬到地里来，吴海云说：“我到那里村公所就在那里，遇有大事，干部趁黑夜开会，订出办法，白天便分头到互助组内办理。”群众中间有问题先在互助组内解决，解决不了，村干部再带上农具到他组里，一面劳动一面解决，此外，该村是通清化大道，每天不断有部队伤员路过，村公所特派两付担架支应差务，担架先在路边给别人打忙，一遇有事立刻起身，节省了不少人力。
