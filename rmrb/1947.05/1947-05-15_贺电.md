    To all comrades of the People's Daily: The experience of the People's Daily in combining with practice over the past year has given us great enlightenment. Over the past year, the influence of the People's Daily among cadres and the masses in southern Hebei has been rapidly expanding. Everyone is vying to read it, which is the result of your being good at embodying Chairman Mao's thoughts. On the occasion of the first anniversary of the founding of the newspaper, in addition to learning from you, we also wish you good health!
