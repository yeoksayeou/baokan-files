　　Grasp the Enemy's Weakness of Insufficient Troops
    Boldly Launch Guerrilla Warfare in the KMT-Occupied Areas
    Jilu Yu Daily Publishes Editorial Calling For Action
    [This newspaper's dispatch from Jilu Yu, 29th] The Jilu Yu Daily recently published an editorial entitled "How to Correctly Implement the Struggle Policy in Guerrilla Areas." The editorial pointed out: In order to deal with the development of our guerrilla warfare, the enemy has begun to concentrate in local areas, using some of its forces to carry out repeated "mopping-up" operations, attempting to nibble away at our territory. This has resulted in relatively tense situations in some local areas, while most areas are empty and lax. We must seize on this weakness of the enemy, adhere to the principle of "counties not leaving counties, districts not leaving districts" in guerrilla warfare, inflict heavy blows on the enemy, and continuously develop and improve it into mass guerrilla warfare. The editorial stated: After summarizing eight months of struggle experience, the district party committee has clearly determined the future struggle policy: "For a longer period, we must adhere to independent, free, and self-reliant guerrilla warfare, utilize the enemy's weaknesses of insufficient troops and the unjust nature of the war, seize every opportunity to strengthen our forces, develop our armed forces, consolidate rural positions, promote a proactive offensive spirit, boldly launch guerrilla warfare, and crush the enemy's "mopping-up" arrogance. In local areas, we must be prepared to persist in highly decentralized guerrilla warfare under the most difficult conditions." In order to correctly implement this policy, we must first change the "waiting for the main force, biding time, and passively hiding" erroneous thinking among some cadres. Secondly, we must create a thought trend among cadres of "strengthening our own forces in guerrilla warfare," be a hundred times more vigilant, overcome the phenomenon of being lax and麻木 when the environment is relaxed, and panicking when the situation is tense. We must advocate a spirit of heroic struggle and arduous struggle, and greatly promote a proactive offensive spirit, and resolutely eliminate passive and backward shrinking phenomena. Experience has proven that only by actively attacking the enemy, implementing the policy of "the enemy advances, we advance; the enemy does not advance, we also advance," can we overwhelm the enemy and smash the enemy's offensive.

　　抓紧敌人兵力不足弱点
    放手开展蒋占区游击战
    冀鲁豫日报著论号召
    【本报冀鲁豫二十九日电】冀鲁豫日报顷以“如何正确执行游击区的斗争方针”为题发表社论。该社论指出：敌人为对付我游击战争的发展，在局部地区开始集中，一部兵力实行反复扫荡，企图逐境蚕食，因而形成局部地区比较紧张，而大部地区则空虚松弛。抓紧敌人此弱点，坚持“县不离县、区不离区”的游击战，予敌以重大打击，并不断发展提高，成为群众性的游击战。该社论称：区党委在总结了八个月斗争经验之后，已明确的确定了今后的斗争方针：“在较长时期内，坚持独立自由的、自力更生的游击战争，利用敌人兵力不足和战争非正义的弱点，抓紧一切空隙，壮大我们的力量，发展武装，巩固农村阵地，发扬积极主动进攻精神，放手开展游击战争，打击敌人“扫荡”气焰。在局部地区，必须准备在最艰苦的情况下，坚持高度分散性的游击战争。”为了正确的执行这一方针，必须先转变某些干部中“等待主力、熬时间，消极躲藏的误错思想。”其次，要在干部中掀起“在游击战争中壮大自己力量”的思想，要百倍紧张起来，克服在环境缓和时松懈麻痹，情况紧张则张惶失措的现象，要提倡英勇奋斗、艰苦奋斗的作风，应大大发扬积极主动的进攻精神，坚决肃清消极被动的退缩现象。经验证明：只有以我之积极向敌进攻，实行“敌进我进，敌不进我也进”的方针，才能压倒敌人，粉碎敌人进攻。
