　　Zhou Enlai Sends Congratulations to the Assembly, Stating:
    Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee are All in Northern Shaanxi; Hu Zongnan's Invasion Intentions Have Completely Failed
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi Front, 15th] (Delayed) Our special correspondent Lin Lang reports: General Zhou Enlai, representing the CPC Central Committee, announced to the Border Region military and civilians at a victory celebration rally held somewhere near Yan'an on the 14th: "Comrade Mao Zedong and the CPC Central Committee have remained in northern Shaanxi since abandoning Yan'an, fighting together with the military and civilians of the entire border region." This statement caused the entire military and civilians to erupt in prolonged, joyful cheers, and completely shattered the intentions of Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan's thirty-one brigade's frantic offensives on the western battlefield for more than two months. When he stepped onto the podium, the Northwest People's Liberation Army fired a seven-gun salute with artillery seized from Hu Zongnan. General Zhou Enlai first congratulated the entire military and civilians, saying, "I represent the CPC Central Committee in congratulating you, and represent the Chinese people in thanking you. At the same time, I welcome liberated soldiers to jointly defeat the national, peaceful, and democratic enemy. Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan dreamed of driving away the CPC Central Committee, eliminating the Northwest People's Liberation Army, and destroying the Border Region people, but they have not accomplished any of it. The Chiang-Hu army has not only failed to eliminate us, but has been eliminated by us by three brigades; not only has it failed to conquer the Border Region people, but the Border Region people have actively participated in guerrilla units and regular armies." Then, General Zhou Enlai used various facts to criticize Chiang Kai-shek's shameful behavior of selling out national interests to American imperialists, and called on the entire Border Region of 1.6 million people and the People's Liberation Army to completely eliminate the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek army. He called on the Northwest People's Liberation Army to be determined to eliminate the entire Hu Zongnan army, recover Yan'an, and liberate the Great Northwest.

　　周恩来同志向大会致贺称
    毛主席党中央均在陕北胡军进犯意图全部破产
    【新华社陕北前线十五日电】（迟到）本社特派记者林朗报导：周恩来将军代表中共中央，于十四日在延安附近某地举行的边区军民祝捷大会上，向他们宣布：“毛泽东同志与中共中央，自从放弃延安后一直留在陕北，与边区全体军民共同奋斗。”他这个声明使全体军民如狂的持久的欢呼，使蒋介石、胡宗南在西战场两个多月来三十一个旅的疯狂进攻意图全部破产。他登上讲台时，西北人民解放军以从胡宗南手中缴获的大炮鸣礼炮七响；周恩来将军首先向全体军民致贺，他说：“我代表中共中央庆祝你们，代表中国人民感谢你们，同时欢迎解放战士共同战胜民族的、和平的、民主的敌人。蒋介石、胡宗南梦想赶走中共中央，消灭西北解放军，摧残边区人民，但是一件也没有做到。蒋胡军不仅未能消灭我们，反被我们消灭了三个旅；不仅未能征服边区人民，边区人民反踊跃参加游击队和正规军。”接着周恩来将军以种种事实，指摘蒋介石出卖民族国家利益给美帝国主义者的可耻行为，号召全边区一百六十万人民及解放军，将卖国的蒋家军全部消灭。号召西北人民解放军下定决心消灭全部胡宗南军，收复延安，解放大西北。
