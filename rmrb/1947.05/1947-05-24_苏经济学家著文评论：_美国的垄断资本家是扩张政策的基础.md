　　Soviet Economist Writes Article Commenting:
    American Monopoly Capitalists are the Foundation of Expansionist Policies
    (Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th) TASS Moscow dispatch: Prominent Soviet economist Rubinstein recently published an article in *Pravda* entitled "American Monopoly Capitalists – The Foundation of Imperialist Expansion," stating: The Second World War caused an unprecedented growth in the power of American monopolists. Before the war, the United States had only forty-nine industrial companies employing over ten thousand workers; as the war neared its end, the number of industrial companies reached three hundred and forty-four, with their employees increasing from 1.4 million to 5.1 million. In 1917, there were six industrial companies with capital exceeding 100 million yuan; in 1942, the number of such companies increased to thirty-two, with their total assets increasing from 100 million yuan to 670 million yuan. The largest American monopolists expanded greatly during the war, and their capital and other assets are now extending their tentacles to all capitalist and colonial countries, striving to seize sources of raw materials, industries, railways, airlines, and banking businesses.

    The threat of a new economic panic increases these desires for economic expansion and is simultaneously utilized to implement policies of increasing armaments, researching war science, and formulating industrial mobilization plans. This policy enables monopolists to obtain large amounts of gold from new tasks assigned by the government. At the same time, American reactionary forces are doing their utmost to incite tension and unrest in the world. They are stirring up civil war in China, supplying the Kuomintang army with American weapons and equipment. In many countries, they deliberately aggravate destruction to make it easier to seize these countries' economies. American trusts own many enterprises in Germany and its satellite states. These enterprises, which served the Nazi war machine during the war, produced huge profits for their masters. Typical examples are the German branches of American Telephone and Telegraph, Ford, and General Motors, which expanded their production capacity during the war, and the Anglo-American Oil Company in Romania, which served the Hitlerite gang. After the war, Anglo-American monopoly capital in the Allied occupation zones of Germany not only recovered their factories but are also enthusiastically purchasing other factories being sold; they are also restoring connections with German industrialists. Rubinstein concluded that the monopoly capital that made a fortune during the war is pursuing control of the entire world. Therefore, they not only want to conquer the economies and finances of many countries but also attempt to exert strong pressure on domestic and foreign policies. The aim of American monopoly capital's plan is to subject many countries to the policies of American monopoly capital. The most important guarantee of international peaceful cooperation lies in resolutely struggling against the adventurous expansionist plans of monopoly capital and its agents on the international stage, and against the conspiracies of international reactionaries who insist on new war plans.

　　苏经济学家著文评论：
    美国的垄断资本家是扩张政策的基础
    【新华社陕北二十日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：著名苏联经济学家卢宾斯坦顷在真理报上以《美国垄断资本家——帝国主义扩张的基础》为题撰文称：第二次世界大战引起美国垄断家力量的空前的增长。大战前，美国仅有四十九个工业公司，雇工逾万人；而战争将近结束时，工业公司就达到三百四十四个，其雇工由一百四十万增加到五百一十万。一九一七年资本在十万万元以上的工业公司有六个；而在一九四二年这样的公司就增加到三十二个，其总资产由一百万万元增到六百七十万万元。最大的美国垄断家在战时大量地膨胀了，他们的资本和其他资产现在又把他们的触角伸张到所有资本主义国家和殖民地国家，力图攫取原料来源、工业、铁路、航空线与银行业务。
    新的经济恐慌的威胁增加了这些经济扩张的欲望，同时又被利用来实行增加军备，研究战争科学，制定工业动员计划的政策。这种政策使垄断家能从政府新的指派任务中获得大量黄金。与这同时，美国反动势力又竭力在世界上煽动紧张和不安。他们在中国煽起内战，供给国民党军队以美国武器及装备。在许多国家，他们故意去加重破坏，以便比较容易地攫取这些国家的经济。美国托辣斯在德国及其卫星国拥有不少企业。这些曾在战争中为纳粹战争机构服务的企业替他们的主子生产了巨大的利润。典型的例子是在战争中扩大其生产力的德境美国电话电报公司、福特和通用汽车分公司，及为希特勒党徒服役的在罗马尼亚的英美石油公司。战后在德境盟军占领区的英美垄断资本不仅取回了他们的工厂，并正热中于购买其他出卖的工厂；他们并和德国工业家恢复了联系。卢氏结论称：在战争中大发其财的垄断资本，正在追求对全世界的控制。因此他们不但想征服很多国家的经济和财政，并且企图对内政与外交政策也施以强大的压力。美国垄断资本的计划目的在于使许多国家屈服在美国的垄断资本的政策之下。国际间和平合作的最重要保障，在于坚决斗争以反对垄断资本及其代理人在国际舞台上之冒险的扩张主义计划，和反对坚持新战争计划的国际反动派之阴谋。
