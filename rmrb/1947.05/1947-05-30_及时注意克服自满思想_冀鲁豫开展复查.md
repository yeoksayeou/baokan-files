Hebei-Shandong-Henan News, 28th: In Hebei-Shandong-Henan, the land reform is turning to review. On May 5th, Guanxian County held a symposium for activists from counties and districts to study future work. Some comrades believed that the land reform had been done almost completely, and it was time to shift to production. However, most comrades believed that many villages were still controlled by stubborn elements. Many bad landlords were still hiding and evading liquidation, and the masses still did not dare to raise their heads. Therefore, a review must be carried out to completely eliminate feudalism. After a heated debate at the meeting, the idea of "almost done" was corrected. In the process of review, the issue of reforming village cadres should focus on praising the positive aspects, establishing righteousness, and reforming their backwardness, so as to achieve unity between cadres and the masses. Regarding the integration of war and production, villages with mutual aid in production should base themselves on mutual aid to implement division of labor between the front and rear. Villages without mutual aid in production should base themselves on self-defense teams to implement labor exchange and solve the production difficulties of military families and workers' families. However, both should organize old and young teams to supplement the shortage of labor. After completing the task of joining the army, Qingfeng County Party Committee held a joint meeting of district committees to discuss future work. The meeting reflected that some district and village cadres had a more serious "rest" mentality, believing that the land reform was almost done and they could take a break. The county party committee pointed out that the "rest" mentality is very harmful to work. Currently, many feudal vestiges are of the greatest concern to the masses. If they are not resolved, more problems will arise in the future. There are still many blank villages and many landlords who have not been thoroughly struggled against. A continued review should be carried out to thoroughly struggle against the feudal landlords, so that the peasants can be thoroughly liberated economically and politically, and the masses can be mobilized more fully and extensively. On April 27th, Nanfeng County held a meeting of cadres from the entire county to arrange the review work. At the meeting, some cadres believed that the land reform movement had just passed, and a period of joining the army had just taken place, everyone was very tired, and future work could be done "slowly" and "regularly." In response to this situation, the conference made a timely enlightening report, pointing out that the peasants' liberation had not been thorough, and introduced the review movement in Puxian County, clarifying the goal of thoroughly eliminating landlords and thoroughly liberating peasants. Each group then discussed in conjunction with the situation in its own area. Some found that there were still many landlords who had not been thoroughly struggled against, such as the landlord in Baimiao who had only undergone one investigation. In Wulihou, Yang Yonghe, who had served as a puppet county chief, had only undergone a sham struggle. There were also some "backward" village cadres colluding with landlords, becoming stumbling blocks in the work. Finally, everyone unanimously believed that the peasants' liberation was not thorough, and in the future, feudalism and landlords should be thoroughly eliminated, so that the peasants could truly be the masters of their own affairs. In the review movement, the task of carrying out mass anti-special agent work, developing the Party, strengthening village administration, and launching the women's movement should be implemented.

Hebei-Shandong-Henan News, 28th: In the land reform review in Shou Zhang and other places, many hidden landlords were discovered. Ren Guangze, a landlord in Bailing, First District of Shou Zhang, donated dozens of shi of grain during the past democratic and livelihood struggles. In hot weather, he took money to the melon fields, and if members of the peasant association and children's corps went to eat melons, he would insist on paying for them. He also used his own house as a school. He was the first to take out money when the village needed it, and he showed progress everywhere. The masses also said, "Although he is rich, he is very progressive." So he had not been struggled against in the past, nor had he been liquidated in the land reform. During the review, the village cadres resolutely checked for hidden wealth and found a pistol with six bullets. The gun was polished very brightly. Only then did the villagers realize that his past progress was a false front. Liu Yongduan, Liu Guangxin, Liu Yongtai and other landlords in Chenlou, Seventh District of Shou Zhang, were found to have participated in special agent organizations during the investigation, and a diary was found. It recorded: From January 1, 1934, to the present, who from the joint association organized the peasant association on a certain year, month, and day, who was the chairman of the peasant association, who was a member of the peasant association, how much grain was struggled against, who made the suggestions... everything was very clear. In the past, the masses' struggle was not very active, thinking that he was not bad. After reading this ledger, they realized that the landlords had all recorded them, and they would have to settle accounts when Chiang's army came. Only then did they resolve to investigate the landlords. In the investigation the next day, in addition to grain and packages, two shiny steel guns were also found.

　　及时注意克服自满思想
  　冀鲁豫开展复查
    【本报冀鲁豫二十八日电】冀鲁豫各地，土地改革转向复查。观城于五月五日召开县区活动分子座谈会，研究今后工作，有的同志认为土地改革已经搞的差不多了，该转生产啦，但大部分同志认为许多村庄仍为顽固分子操纵政权。尚有不少坏地主隐蔽与逃避清算，群众还不敢抬头。因此必须进行复查，彻底消灭封建。会上经过热烈争论后，纠正了差不多的想法，在进行复查中，对村干部改造问题，应表扬积极面，树立正气改造其落后面，达到干群团结。对于解决战争与生产的结合问题，有生产互助的村，应以互助为基础，实行前后方分工，没生产互助的村，以自卫班为基础，实行变工，并解决军、工属生产困难。但两者均须组织老少班，以补助劳力不足。清丰完成参军任务后，县委特召开各区委联席会，讨论今后工作，会上反映出有些区村干部“歇歇”思想较严重，认为土地改革搞的差不多了，可以歇一歇，松一口气。县委指出“歇歇”思想，危害工作很大，目前有许多封建尾巴是群众最关心的，如解决不了，将来就要出更多问题。还有许多空白村和许多未斗透的地主，仍应继续复查，要做到把封建地主斗透，使农民在经济上、政治上彻底翻身，要使群众发动的更充分更广泛。南峰县于四月二十七日召开了全县干部会，布置复查工作，会上有的干部认为土地改革运动刚过，又进行了一段参军，大家都累的不轻，以后可以“慢慢”的做，“正规”的做了。大会根据此种情况，及时的做了启发报告，指出农民翻身尚未彻底，并介绍了濮县的复查运动，明确了彻底消灭地主，农民彻底翻身的目标，各组即结合本区情况酝酿，有的发现还没斗透地主尚多，如白庙地主只进行一次清查，五里后对当过伪县长的杨永和只进行了假斗争，还有些“落后”村干和地主勾搭，成为工作中的绊脚石，最后大家一致认为农民翻身还不彻底，今后应彻底消灭封建、地主，做到农民真正当家，并在复查运动中，贯彻开展群众性的反特，发展党及加强村政建设，并开展妇女运动。
    【本报冀鲁豫廿八日电】寿张等地于土地改革复查中，发现不少隐蔽地主。寿张一区白岭的地主任广泽，在过去民主、民生斗争时，他献出了几十石粮食，热天他带着钱到爪地里去，农会员、儿童团员去吃瓜，他非给出瓜钱不可，他并将自己的房子做学屋用。村上用钱他先拿出来，处处表现进步，群众也说：“他虽有钱，但人家很进步。”所以过去也没斗争过他，土地改革中也没清算他，在复查中，村干部领导坚决查浮财，才查出他的手枪一支，带着六粒子弹，枪用油擦得很亮，到这时全村群众才认识到他过去的进步是假面具。寿张七区陈楼地主刘永段、刘广信、刘永太等在清查中查出他们参加特务组织，并查出日记一本，上面记着：从民国卅三年一月一日到现在的账，某年某月某日联合会谁去组织农会，谁当农会长，谁是农会员，斗了多少粮食、谁提的意见……，一条条的都非常清楚，以前群众斗争不很积极，认为他还不错，看了这个账单子，才知道地主都给自己记上了账，蒋军来了，都得给算账哩，才决心清查地主；第二天的清查中，除粮食、包袱外，还查出擦得亮亮的钢枪两支。
