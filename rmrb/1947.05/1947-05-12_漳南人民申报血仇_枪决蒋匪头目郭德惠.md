　　[This newspaper's report from Southern Hebei, 9th] The people of Southern Zhang reported their blood feuds, and Chiang Kai-shek's puppet bandit leader Guo Dehui was executed. Guo Dehui, the puppet bandit leader who had entrenched himself in the areas of Huilong and Chuwang for decades, was captured during the battle of Chuwang on April 10th and publicly tried in Shuangmiao on the 23rd. Over ten thousand people were filled with joy and anger, and they discussed among themselves: "In February, Guo Dehui was still here harming our people, killing, beating, and robbing so cruelly. Today, it's our turn to vent our anger!" "These demons who kill without blinking an eye should have this day!" Before the meeting officially started, an old lady anxiously ran to the stage, tears streaming down her face, trembling all over, and said: "Guo Dehui buried my son alive, I must have my revenge!" As she spoke, she fainted twice from anger. The masses present were all moved to tears. Liu Chenshi from Wang Village bitterly recounted: "I struggled to raise my only son after becoming a widow, but he was buried alive by Guo Dehui, and I wasn't even allowed to claim his body." Gao Zhangyu pointed at Guo Dehui and said: "The year before last, you buried eight good people from our village alive, wiping out seven branches of our family. My father was pushing a cart back from Guangping, and you insisted he was a member of the Eighth Route Army and buried him alive!" The masses in the audience all poured out their grievances and cursed him, and finally the bandit Guo was sentenced to death.

    【本报冀南九日电】漳南人民血仇申报，蒋伪匪头子郭德惠被处极刑。盘踞回隆、楚旺一带数十年的伪匪头子郭德惠，于四月十日楚旺战斗中捕获，二十三日在双庙公审。万余众群喜怒交加，纷纷议论：“二月里郭德惠还在这里残害咱百姓，杀、打、抢夺多么狠毒，今天可该咱们出气了！”“这些杀人不眨眼的魔王也该有今天！”尚未正式开会，一个老太太心急地跑到台前，流着泪混身颤抖的说：“郭德惠把俺儿活埋了，得叫俺报仇呀！”她说着气死了两次。到会群众皆为之泪下。王庄刘陈氏苦诉着：“俺守寡好容易养大了一个儿子，被郭德惠活埋了，连尸首也不许领。”高章玉指着郭德惠说：“前年你活埋了俺村八个好老百姓，绝了七股，我父亲从广平推小车回来，你硬说是八路军也活埋了！”全场群众纷纷诉苦痛骂，最后将郭匪处以极刑。
