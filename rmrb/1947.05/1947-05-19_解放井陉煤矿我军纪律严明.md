Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 13th - The Jin-Cha-Ji People's Liberation Army, which liberated the Jingxing Coal Mine this time, has strict discipline and is known as the "model of battlefield discipline." Before the advance, the unit put forward slogans such as liberating the workers and protecting the mining area. During the battle, the political commissar and the director of the political department personally followed the troops to command and encouraged the entire army to earnestly implement battlefield discipline. After the complete annihilation of the defending enemy, only the leaders personally led the designated troops stationed in the mine and carried pre-made seals to seal up warehouses and public buildings, strictly prohibiting unauthorized entry. Not only were all the machines and assets of the mine undamaged, but even the clothes and utensils in the offices and staff residences were not moved, and there was no loss of even a single thread. When the mine workers returned to their dormitories and saw the bedding neatly arranged as usual, they couldn't help but be amazed. Except for a few sentries, there were no soldiers in the mining area streets, and there were no gunshots, just like usual. The rapid restoration of the mine's production relied on the high degree of battlefield discipline displayed by the unit this time as a prerequisite.
Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 14th - High-ranking Chiang Kai-shek and puppet officers who laid down their weapons in the Zhengding Campaign have recently arrived at a certain place in the rear. Among them, Wang Jiaolun, commander of the 13th Regiment of the puppet 5th Column, also staged a reunion drama here. It turned out that Wang and his wife were separated in a panic during the battle. Now, the People's Liberation Army has found her for him and they have reunited. The two were filled with mixed feelings of sorrow and joy, and both shed tears. Liu Haidong, deputy division commander of the 3rd Army, 7th Division, changed into a gray uniform of an ordinary soldier when he was captured. After a few days of being moved by the lenient treatment, he revealed that he was Liu Haidong. Every time Liu talked about the past history of the division and its annihilation this time, he was filled with emotion. (Note: This division was originally an old unit of the Yunnan National Protection Army, which participated in the war against Yuan Shikai and was later incorporated into Chiang Kai-shek's and Hu Zongnan's direct line). He also said: "After being captured, I feel calm and at peace." Among the prisoners in the Zhengding Campaign, Wang Zhiguo, deputy political director of the Chiang Kai-shek puppet 5th Column, Shen Feng, the police chief of Zhengding County, Zhou Fulin, the secretary-general of the Zhengding Kuomintang County Party Department, Ling Qingxuan, the magistrate of Xinle County, Guo Qingfen, the deputy commander of the 13th Regiment of the puppet 5th Column, and Yu Ming, the Chiang Kai-shek magistrate of Zhengding County, were also identified.

　　解放井陉煤矿我军纪律严明
    【新华社晋察冀十三日电】此次解放井陉煤矿之晋察冀人民解放军纪律严明，被称为“战场纪律模范”。该部于进军之前即提出解放工人爱护矿区等口号，战斗中政委、政治部主任均亲随部队指挥，鼓舞全军认真贯彻战场纪律。守敌全歼后，该部仅由首长亲率指定驻矿部队进入，并携带事先制好的封条将仓库公共建筑封存，严禁擅入。该矿不仅一切机器资财毫无破损，即办公室职员住宅内之衣物用具，亦毫未移动其位置，一针一线均无损失。矿厂职工回到宿室，见被服整齐如常，不禁大为惊奇。矿区街市除少数岗哨外，不见军人，更无枪声，一如平时，该矿生产之能迅速恢复，即赖此次该部战场纪律之高度发扬，为先决条件。
    【新华社晋察冀十四日电】正定战役放下武器蒋伪军高级军官最近已抵达后方某地。其中伪五纵队十三团团长王教伦在这里还演了一幕离合悲欢的团员戏。原来王与其妻在战斗中仓惶失散，现人民解放军又替他找到，重新相会，两人悲喜交集，都掉下泪来。三军七师副师长刘海东被俘时，曾换上一身普通士兵的灰军装，几天以后受到宽大待遇的感动，他说出了自己就是刘海东。刘每谈及该师过去历史及此次被歼，即不胜感慨系之。（按该师原为云南护国军旧部，曾参加讨袁护法战役，后被蒋胡收编为嫡系）并说：“被俘后倒觉的心平气和了。”正定战役俘虏中又查出蒋伪第五纵队副政治主任王治国，正定县警察局长沈凤、正定国民党县党部书记长周府麟，新乐县长凌清轩、伪五纵队十三团副团长郭清芬、正定蒋记县长禺铭等多人。
