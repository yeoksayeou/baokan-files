　　Frontline Soldiers Receive Large Number of Family Letters
    "Don't Worry About Us Having Enough to Eat and Wear at Home, Focus on Killing the Enemy!"
    [Report from the Yubei Front, this newspaper, 12th] The People's Liberation Army's 66th Unit on the Yubei Front recently received a large number of comfort packages from the hometowns of the soldiers. The comfort package sent to soldier Li Qingshan from his family contained soap, towels, socks, and a letter to him from the entire village. The letter read: "You are fighting the traitor Chiang Kai-shek in the front and protecting our hometown. We wish you health and the elimination of more enemies... Our village has all been liberated. Your family has five mu of land and four rooms per person, enough to eat, wear, and live in, so don't worry." After receiving the comfort packages, the soldiers' morale was boosted, and they all expressed their determination to make greater contributions to defend the land and defend Chairman Mao. They distributed their own comfort packages to comrades who had just been liberated. A newly liberated comrade from the Fifth Platoon said with emotion, "The liberated areas are indeed good, everyone has food to eat. Let's quickly fight to the south and liberate our homes!"

　　前线战士接到大批家信
    “家里不愁吃穿住一心杀敌莫挂念！”
    【本报豫北前线十二日电】豫北前线人民解放军六六部队最近接到大批战士家乡寄来的慰问袋，战士李青山家里寄来的慰问袋中，装着肥皂、毛巾、袜子和一封全村寄给他的信。信上写着：“你们在前方打卖国贼蒋介石，保护咱们的家乡，祝你们健康和消灭更多的敌人……咱村上都翻了身，你家每人都有五亩地和四间房，吃穿住都够用了，不必挂念。”战士们接到慰问袋后情绪益高，均表示为保卫土地保卫毛主席立更大的功劳。他们把自己的慰问袋分给被解放过来的同志，五班新解放同志感动的说：“还是解放区好，人人有饭吃，赶快打到南方解放我们的家吧”。
