Mobilizing the Masses for Production Experience

After the land reform movement in the Fourth District of Lucheng, the farmers' enthusiasm for production was high. However, there were some deviations in the implementation of policies during the land reform, which caused complex thoughts among a very small number of people. Because of this situation, two viewpoints, two approaches, and two results emerged.

The first viewpoint and approach: Correctly assessing the achievements of the land reform, grasping the masses' positive desire to get rich through production, and overcoming some ideological problems left over from the land reform movement, transferring the masses' enthusiasm in the land reform movement to production. This is a way to boldly mobilize the masses to carry out the production movement. But how to improve the enthusiasm of the masses? The specific experiences are: (1) Conducting widespread and in-depth production propaganda and mobilization work, proposing slogans that become the program of action for farmers: Chairman Mao leads us to turn over and also leads us to produce and get rich. Farmers without land suffer poverty and anger. The tiller owns his land, and the turn over lasts for ten thousand years. Everything is born from the soil, and the land is the lifeline of the farmers. A good life depends on labor, uprooting the roots of poverty and planting the roots of wealth. Labor to get rich is the most glorious. People deceive the land, and the land deceives the stomach. If you want to turn over completely, organize to dig the roots of the land. Marrying a bad wife is for a lifetime, and planting bad crops is for a season. If you don't sow in the spring, you'll be angry to death in the autumn. Cadres take the lead, and production is not worried. Planting the land is fundamental, and the land is a cornucopia, and other specific slogans suitable for farmers. These slogans illustrate that carrying out the great production movement must struggle with the land to inspire the farmer's positive requirements for labor, production and enrichment, and overcome the complacency of the new district after the turn over, and the old district's thought that "cultivating three and having a surplus of one" is not a problem. And overcome the idea of waiting to eat the fruits of struggle without labor, and the fear of getting rich because of struggle. (2) Launching the Wei Zhisheng and Liu Jubao movements, promoting new heroism. The slogan in the Wei Zhisheng movement was: Labor hero Wei Zhisheng, shows talent in production, combining agriculture and sideline occupations and dividing labor, organizing various people in cooperatives. This year, production must be done well, and the Wei Zhisheng movement must be launched. The slogan for the Liu Jubao movement was: Technical expert Liu Jubao, grows all kinds of crops well, grows well and yields a lot, and the role of technology research is high. Everyone should learn from him and strive to be a hero. From this, a new wave of heroism was universally launched, setting off a great wave of production, and promoting the farmers' enthusiasm for production. (3) Using radio stations and mass blackboards to commend heroic models and set off a surge of production. (4) Implementing education from top to bottom on this year's production direction, with agriculture as the main focus, combined with sideline occupations, implementing a year-round, comprehensive, and all-out production movement, requiring every household to achieve "cultivating three and having a surplus of one" without leaving a single household, and every household having surplus grain. The experience of mobilizing the masses to clarify the direction is: 1. Recalling the pain of starvation in famine years and the tragic life of the old society to inspire the masses' thinking of having surplus grain every year. 2. Accurately calculating household property and formulating household plans to inspire the masses with a production direction combining agriculture and sideline occupations. (5) The experience of solving the problem of complacency among the farmers who turned over in the new district is: calling for turning over again, land reform has overthrown feudalism and lifted the stone slab on the farmers, opening up the road for developing production, which does not mean completely turning over. To completely turn over, we must do a good job in production. (6) The experience of solving the fear of getting rich is: discovering typical people and typical ideas for discussion and analysis. For example, Huangyan North Street solves Wei Genxi's thinking, specifically explaining the truth and dispelling his ideological doubts. Another solution: specifically compensating the interests of the middle peasants who have been harmed, so that they can see that what has been struggled against has been compensated, so they are not afraid. The main thing is to overcome his negativity with the enthusiasm of the farmers, which also makes it easier to discover and grasp activists, and use the power of activists to overcome the thinking of backward elements. (7) On the basis of the enthusiasm of the masses, clarify this year's production direction, and call for organizing. This organization requires the masses to organize automatically, consciously, and voluntarily, so that it is easy to consolidate.

Another viewpoint and approach is to regard the individual as the whole, and the special as the general, grasping the negative, fearful of getting rich thoughts of individual people, while ignoring the positive production requirements of the broad masses. Therefore, his approach is to first discover legacy issues and solve legacy issues. Because his views and approaches are different, the problem he grasps is also the negative side, and the result is that evil prevails over righteousness, no activists can be discovered, and the problem cannot be solved. The reason for this style is the old style and old routine, burdened by the baggage of empiricism. Therefore, in this year's production movement, correctly assessing the production enthusiasm of the masses, criticizing and accepting past experience, letting go of the baggage of empiricism, and boldly mobilizing the masses to give full play to the creativity of the masses are the main keys to carrying out this year's production.

### 发动群众生产经验

　　发动群众生产经验
    潞城四区土地改革运动后，农民生产情绪高涨，但在土地改革中执行政策上多少有些偏差，所以也引起了极少数人的复杂思想，由于这种情况，便产生了两种观点，两种作法，两种结果。
    第一种观点和作法是：正确的估计了土地改革的成绩，抓住了群众生产积极要求发家致富的一面，克服土地改革运动中遗留的一些思想问题，把群众在土地改革运动中的积极性转到生产中来，这便是大胆放手发动群众开展生产运动中的一种作法。但如何提高群众这种热情呢？具体经验是：（一）普遍而深入的开展生产宣传鼓动工作，提出成为农民行动纲领的口号：毛主席领导咱们翻了身，又领导咱们生产发家。农民没有地受穷又受气。耕者有其田，翻身万万年。万物本是土中生，地是农民活命根。过好时光靠劳动，拔了穷根栽富根，劳动发家最光荣。人哄地皮，地哄肚皮。要想翻透身，组织起来刨地根。说不好媳妇是一辈，种不好庄稼是一季。春天不下籽，秋后气个死。干部起带头，生产不发愁。种地是根本，地是聚宝盆等具体而适合农民的口号。这些口号，说明了开展大生产运动必须向土地作斗争，来启发农民劳动生产发家的积极要求，克服了新区翻身后自满思想，及老区的耕三余一不成问题思想。并且克服了等吃斗争果实不劳动，以及怕斗争不敢发财思想。（二）开展魏之胜、刘聚宝运动，发扬新英雄主义。在开展魏之胜运动当中口号是：劳动英雄魏之胜，生产显才能，农副业结合又分工，合作社里组织了各种人，今年生产要搞好，开展魏之胜大运动。开展刘聚宝运动的口号是：技术能手刘聚宝，各种庄稼种的好，长的好来打的多，技术研究作用高。人人都要学习他，争取能手显英豪。由此普遍开展了新英雄主义的竞赛，掀起了生产大浪潮，发扬了农民的生产积极性。（三）运用广播台、大众黑板，表扬英雄模范，掀起生产热潮。（四）自上而下的贯彻今年生产方向的教育，以农业为主，结合副业，贯彻全年全面全力的生产运动，要求家家户户不留一户的达到耕三余一，家家户户有余粮。动员群众明确方向的经验是：一、回忆灾荒年饿死人的痛苦与旧社会的悲惨生活，启发群众年年有余粮的思想。二、精确计算家当，订按家计划，启发群众以农副业结合的生产方向。（五）解决新区翻身农民自满思想的经验是：号召翻身再翻身，土地改革打垮了封建揭了农民身上的石板，打开了发展生产的道路，不等于完全翻了身，彻底翻身还必须好好搞生产。（六）解决不敢发家思想经验是：发现典型人物、典型思想来讨论分析。如黄研北街解决魏根喜的思想，具体说明道理，解除他的思想怀疑。另外一种解决办法：具体的补偿被损害的中农利益，使他看到已斗的又补偿起来，就不怕了。而主要的是以农民的积极性来克服他的消极性，这样也容易发现与掌握积极分子，以积极分子的力量来克服落后分子的思想。（七）在群众热情的基础上，明确今年的生产方向，号召组织起来，这种组织起来，是要群众自动自觉自愿的组织起来，才容易巩固。
    另一种观点和作法，是把个别看成全面，把特殊看成一般，抓住了个别人的消极不敢发财思想，而忽视了广大群众积极生产要求的一面。因此他的作法是首先就去发现遗留问题，解决遗留问题。正因他的看法作法不同，抓住的问题也是消极的一面，其结果是邪气压倒正气，发现不了积极分子，问题解决不了，产生这种作风的原因，是旧作风老一套，背上经验主义的包袱，所以在今年的生产运动中，正确的估计群众的生产热情，批判接受过去的经验，放掉经验主义的包袱，大胆放手的发动群众尽量发挥群众的创造力，这是开展今年生产的主要关键。
