[Reported from Jinnan on the 17th of this month by our newspaper] Qi Ze, an old hired laborer from Shijiazhuang, District One, Nangong, is now sixty-three years old. He worked as a laborer for more than twenty years. In famine years, he sold his only four mu of land, and his wife starved to death, leaving behind a thirteen-year-old girl. They even ate the grain husks from the pillow. When the opportunity came to redeem land, he redeemed it. In the land reform, he was allocated three mu of land. No longer a hired laborer, he carefully cultivates his own land. This spring, there was a long drought with no rain. Learning from the lessons of the famine years, he abandoned the idea of relying on heaven for rain. First, he carried water to plant two mu of cotton, and turned one mu of reed ditch into a garden, planting kohlrabi, green beans, pumpkins, and potatoes. He works day and night. Previously, he and his daughter ate three jin of grain per day, but now it has been reduced to two jin, and he also takes time to collect willow and poplar leaves as substitute food. He often says, "Surviving a famine year is like passing the gate of life and death. Now that the years are uncertain, we should make plans early."

　　齐老汉翻身不忘旱年苦
    早做打算节米备荒
    【本报冀南十七日电】南宫一区师家庄老雇工齐泽，现年六十三岁，扛活二十多年，灾荒年仅有的四亩地也卖了，老婆饿死了，丢下一个十三岁的小女孩，把枕头里的谷秕都吃光。赎地时他把地赎回，土地改革中又分三亩地，不扛活，细心经营着自己的土地。今春久旱不雨，他接受灾荒年的教训，打破靠天等雨思想，首先挑水种棉二亩，并将一亩苇壕开成园子，种上根达菜、豆角、北瓜、山药蛋，黑天白日都在劳动，从前他父女每天吃三斤粮食，现在减为二斤，并每天抽空去采柳叶杨叶等代食品。他常说：“过灾荒年就是过生死关，现在年景不定，应该早作打算”。
