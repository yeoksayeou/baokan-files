    Mao Dun and his wife return to Shanghai
    The famous Chinese writer Mao Dun and his wife, who were invited by the Soviet Union's Foreign Cultural Association to visit the Soviet Union, returned to Shanghai on the Soviet postal ship "Smolny" at 6 pm on April 24.
    Cultural Activities on the Front Lines
    1. Moving scenes of the Wang Keqin Movement
    The photographic report on the Wang Keqin Movement in the troops has been actively carried out by the frontline photography team in cooperation with the troop photography reporters. The frontline activities of Comrade Wang Keqin, the combat hero himself, and his heroic comrades-in-arms have been filmed into photos such as the Juanan Battle. They are now working with the troop photography reporters to specifically follow the activities of Wang Keqin's platoon to produce films of his actual activities. (Holding)
    2. Active troop publications on the front lines
    The merit-making campaign and cultural activities of the "Shenyang" troops on the Yubei Front are becoming increasingly active. "Combat News" has been published to the 17th issue despite the difficulties of lacking a mimeograph operator and editor. It has also launched "Combat Correspondence," a comprehensive publication for exchanging troop work experience and literature and art, which has now been published to the third issue. It persists in publishing during marches and battles. Based on the enthusiastic development of grassroots communication work, various forms of company newspapers have become effective weapons for strengthening the combat effectiveness of the troops. The "Open-Air Newspaper" of the 9th company of a small detachment, which is very popular among the soldiers, is filled with fast-clapper rhymes and cartoons created by the soldiers themselves every day. Articles praising models are published in a prominent position. (Resisting Thousands)
    A unit of the Jinan People's Liberation Army launched a soldier-compiled fast-clapper rhyme movement, which has played a significant role in soldier education. This movement started with the 5th company of a certain regiment and has now spread to the brigade. The soldiers are very active and enthusiastic, and they are composing fast-clapper rhymes even when they are sleeping. During the rectification period, the fast-clapper rhyme was used to spread the practice of training models and guiding the method of training soldiers. During marches, the fast-clapper rhyme was used to praise marching models. During combat, the fast-clapper rhyme was used to describe battles, praise heroes, and boost combat morale. Because there are so many people compiling, and the manuscripts are crowded, the regimental and battalion newspapers cannot fully carry them, so they have created various types of newspapers. Such as the "Mobile Living Newspaper" of a certain regiment, and the "Daily Life Newspaper" of a certain regiment. Another way to publish is to take them to each company, platoon, and squad to be read aloud or circulated, or to be read aloud by the author during troop gatherings. The fast-clapper rhyme movement is now developing from a simple personal monologue to a dialogue. According to the leadership's estimate, there is a possibility of further development into a fast-clapper rhyme drama.
    3. Play "Wang Keqin Class" performed in the troops
    The military region's cultural troupe and the 1036 cultural team performed for the 45 troops, which won the welcome of all the soldiers. In particular, the performance of "Wang Keqin Class" was even more effective. After the play was performed, the soldiers and squad leaders further recognized the significance of the Wang Keqin Movement; they recognized the benefits of the mutual aid group. After watching the performance of the Wang Keqin class, they spontaneously held meetings to review their personal understanding of this movement, as well as the shortcomings that exist in this movement, and are determined to overcome them.

    茅盾夫妇返国抵沪
    应苏联对外文化协会之邀访苏之我国名作家茅盾夫妇已于四月二十四日下午六时乘苏联邮船斯摩纳尔号返国抵沪。
    前线文化活动
    一  王克勤运动收入镜头
    关于部队的王克勤运动之摄影报导，已由前线摄影组配合部队摄影记者积极进行，关于战斗英雄王克勤同志本人及其英雄战友们的火线活动，已拍成鄄南战斗等照片，现正协同部队摄影记者，专门跟随王克勤排活动，从事摄制其实际活动。（持）
    二  活跃在前线的部队刊物
    豫北前线“沈阳”部队通讯立功运动与文化活动日趋活跃。《战斗报》在缺乏油印员与编辑的困难条件下，已出至十七期，还创刊了交流部队工作经验、与文艺性的综合刊物《战斗通讯》，现已出至第三期。在行军与战斗中仍坚持出版。在下层通讯工作热烈开展的基础上，各种形式的连队报纸均成为加强部队战斗力的有效武器。一小队九连深受战士们欢迎的《露天报》，每天满载着战士们自己创作的快板、漫画。表扬模范的稿件在首要地位刊出。（抵千）
    晋南人民解放军某部发动士兵编快板运动，对士兵教育起了很大作用。这一运动由某团五连开始，现已普遍到旅。战士们非常积极热情，睡觉都在编快板。整训时以快板传播练兵模范，领导练兵的方法。行军时以快板表扬行军模范。作战时以快板描写战斗，表扬英雄，提高战斗情绪。由于编的人多，稿件拥挤，团、营报纸不能全载，他们又创造了各种类型的报纸。如某团的《流动活报》，某团的《生活日报》等。另一种发表办法是拿到各连排班诵读或传阅，或在部队集合时由作者朗读。快板运动现正从单纯的个人独白发展到对话。据领导上估计，有进一步发展为快板剧的可能。
    三  剧本《王克勤班》在部队公演
    军区文工团和一○三六文工队到四五部队公演，博得了全体战士的欢迎，特别是《王克勤班》的演出，收效更大。该剧演出后战士班长都进一步认识了王克勤运动的意义；认识了互助组的好处。他们看了王克勤班演出后，就自发的开会检讨个人对这一运动的认识，以及在这一运动中所存在的缺点，决心加以克服。
