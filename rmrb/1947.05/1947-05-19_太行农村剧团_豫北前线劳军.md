　　Performs for Troops on the豫 North Frontline

　　[Report from the 豫 North Front by this newspaper] A large number of rural theater troupes from the Taihang area have gone to the front lines to perform. Those performing for our troops besieging Tangyin alone include the Victory Theater Troupe of Changzhi, the Mass Theater Troupe of Lucheng, the Liming Theater Troupe of Licheng, the豫 North People's Theater Troupe, and the Wu'an Theater Troupe. They set up stages in villages not far from the city. Famous plays such as "The White Haired Girl," "Blood and Tears of Hatred," and "Three Attacks on the Zhu Family Village" have been performed one after another. The sounds of gongs, drums, and wind instruments intermingle with the sounds of gunfire, cannons, and hand grenades, forming an unprecedented tense and joyful battlefield scene. The soldiers warmly welcome this amidst fierce fighting, greatly boosting their combat courage. The "White Haired Girl" performed by the豫 North People's Theater Troupe has been highly praised by the soldiers. (Yaowu)

　　太行农村剧团
    豫北前线劳军
    【本报豫北前线讯】太行区大批农村剧团赴前线出演。仅对我汤阴围城部队演出者即有长治之胜利剧团、潞城之大众剧团、黎城之黎明剧团、豫北人民剧团、武安剧团等，他们在距城不远的村庄中搭起舞台。曾先后演出白毛女、血泪仇、三打祝家庄等名剧。锣鼓管弦之音与枪声、炮声、手榴弹声互相交错，此起彼伏，形成一种从来未有的紧张而愉快的战场场面。战士们于激烈战斗中对此表示热烈欢迎，大大鼓舞了他们的战斗勇气。豫北人民剧团所演出之白毛女，颇得战士好评。（耀武）
