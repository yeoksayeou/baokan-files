Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th: A Central News Agency dispatch on the 24th reported that Chiang Kai-shek's Shanghai-Songhu Garrison Headquarters has forcibly ordered three major newspapers in Shanghai, the Wenhui Daily, the United Evening News, and the Xinmin Evening News, to cease publication on the 25th. The Headquarters' "order" stated: "It has been found that the aforementioned newspapers have continuously published news that hinders military affairs and contains speeches and news that intend to subvert the government and disrupt public order. As this city is under martial law, it should be banned. In accordance with the provisions of martial law, the aforementioned newspapers are ordered to cease publication from the 25th and must not be disobeyed." Furthermore, according to the French News Agency, Chiang's Central Propaganda Department has issued a telephone instruction to all newspaper offices in Nanjing, prohibiting them from expressing any sympathy for the closure of these three newspapers. Because in the current emergency situation in Shanghai, the "freedom of the press" guaranteed by the "Constitution" is no longer applicable.

　　蒋政府勒令文汇报停刊
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】中央社二十四日讯：蒋介石之淞沪警备司令部已强迫上海著名之文汇报、联合晚报、及新民晚报三大报纸，于二十五日停刊。该部“命令”称：“查该报连续登载妨害军事之消息，及意图颠覆政府、破坏公共秩序之言论与新闻；本市为戒严地区，应予取缔。依照戒严法规定，着令该报于二十五日起停刊，毋得违误。”又据法新闻处称：蒋记中央宣传部已以电话训令南京各报馆，禁止对此三家报纸之停刊表示任何同情。因为在目前上海的紧急情况下，“宪法”所保证之“出版自由”已不适用。
