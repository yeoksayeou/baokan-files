　　Defend the Interests of the Emancipated, Thoroughly Annihilate the Chiang Army
    Zuoquan Militia Enthusiastically Enlist
    [Report from this newspaper, Zuoquan] The first group of 1,300 militiamen from Zuoquan County departed on April 27th under orders to support the front lines. At the mobilization meeting, County Chief Gong and Political Commissar Zhai took the lead in calling on all militiamen to resolutely accept the tasks assigned by higher authorities, to perform meritorious service for the people of the entire county, and to defend our emancipated interests. Finally, Deputy Political Commissar Xu proposed: "Embrace the glorious mission, thoroughly uproot the old roots of the landlords, and strive for the great emancipation of the people of the whole country!" After he finished speaking, slogans resounded throughout the venue: "Respond to the call of higher authorities and resolutely complete the glorious mission!" That afternoon, the masses in Chengguan held a send-off ceremony amidst the deafening sounds of gongs and drums. An old stall vendor said, "Our strength is truly great; even the militia alone can scare the hell out of those sons of bitches." Wang Yunwang, an emancipated merchant, said, "Young people are uprooting the old roots at the front lines; I wish you all meritorious service upon your return." The mutual aid team of Xiachuang in the Sixth District proposed to cultivate the land on behalf of the participating militiamen, ensuring that their families would not encounter any difficulties, and so on. The participating militiamen were in high spirits when they left, especially the militiamen from the Fourth District, who, after receiving the order, rushed to the city overnight, despite being a hundred li away, and set off with the main force that day.

    [Report from this newspaper, Shexian] The second group of more than three thousand emancipated peasants serving as stretcher-bearers from Shexian County arrived at the front at the end of April. The Shexian Frontline Headquarters, in order to strengthen the leadership of the newly arrived stretcher-bearers, convened a meeting of county headquarters and major brigade cadres under the leadership of Captain Qin and Director Feng to discuss the organizational leadership and ideological education of the newly arrived stretcher-bearers. Based on experience, several methods were researched: 1. The county headquarters should try to fix its location in the future to facilitate contact. 2. Issue home return certificates to stretcher-bearers. 3. Organize a discipline inspection team. 4. Select a reporter from each squad to report on the deeds of model figures. 5. Immediately organize a merit-recording committee to record meritorious deeds. 6. All personal belongings brought by the new stretcher-bearers should be registered to avoid confusion.

　　保卫翻身利益彻底歼灭蒋军
    左权民兵踊跃参战
    【本报左权讯】左权首批一千三百民兵，于四月廿七日奉令出发，支援前线。在动员大会上，首由巩县长、翟政委号召全体民兵坚决接受上级任务，要为全县人民立功，保卫我们翻身利益。最后徐副政委提出：迎接光荣任务，彻底刨倒地主老根，争取全国人民大翻身。他话讲毕，全场口号四起：响应上级号召，坚决完成光荣任务。当天下午城关群众举行欢送，锣鼓暄天，一个摆摊老汉说：“咱们力量真大，光民兵也能把狗日吓死。”翻身商人王云旺说：“青年前线刨老根，祝你们都立功回来。”六区下庄互助大队提出先给参战民兵代耕，保证家庭受不到任何困难等等。参战民兵走时，情绪非常高涨，特别是四区民兵，离城百里，接到命令后，连夜赶到，当天随着大队出发了。

    【本报涉县讯】涉县第二批担架三千余翻身农民于四月底到达前方。涉县前方指挥部，为加强新来担架的领导，在秦队长、冯主任领导下，召开了县指挥部及各大队干部会议，讨论了对新来担架的组织领导及思想教育问题。根据经验，研究出几个办法：一、县指挥部以后要尽量固定地点，便于联系。二、印发担架人员回家证。三、组织纪律检查组。四、每中队选一个报导员，反映模范人物事迹。五、马上组织立功委员会，进行记功。六、新担架来了以后，所带自用物品一律登记，以免混乱。
