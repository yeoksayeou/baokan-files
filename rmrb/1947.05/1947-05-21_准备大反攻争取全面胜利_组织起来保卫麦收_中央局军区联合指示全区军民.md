　　Prepare for the Great Counteroffensive to Strive for Overall Victory
    Organize to Defend the Wheat Harvest
    Joint Directive from the Central Bureau and Military Region to All Military Personnel and Civilians in the Region
    [Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] As the wheat harvest approaches, the Central Bureau and Military Region have jointly issued a directive, calling on all Party members, government officials, military personnel, and civilians in the region to unite and organize, and to do everything possible to defend the wheat harvest. The directive stated: This year's wheat harvest is an important guarantee for preparing for the counteroffensive and striving for overall victory. Therefore, all military personnel and civilians in the region must be highly organized, carry forward the past experience of combining labor and military affairs, strike at the enemy's grain plundering, and defend the masses' wheat harvest. When the wheat harvest season arrives, personnel from all departments of local authorities must do their utmost to help the masses with harvesting. Wherever the local troops go, they should help the masses harvest there, so that the wheat harvest in all areas can truly be done quickly and stored quickly. What is particularly important is that all departments of our Party, government, military, and civilians should actively organize the struggle against the enemy, take the initiative to attack, and strike at all enemy conspiracies to seize grain, and successfully accomplish the task of defending the masses' wheat harvest.

    [News from this Newspaper] Comrade Pei Chun from the Yubei Front reports: The Yubei Front troops of the Taihang People's Liberation Army are actively helping the masses in the war zone with spring plowing and sowing. The "Qingzhang" directly subordinate troops and the militia and masses participating in the war, in the midst of the intense battle to fight Tangyin, helped the masses irrigate 31 mu of land, weed 27 mu, hoe 574 mu, plow 8.5 mu, and deliver 2,253 loads and 50 large carts of manure. They also paid attention to planned conservation and substituted for the masses in helping the army with errands. In order to further implement the campaign for spring plowing and sowing, the leadership recently held a meeting to decide to extract 15% to 30% of manpower according to the different conditions of each unit, and strive to use the gaps in the war, or squeeze time out of the tense war to help the masses with spring plowing and sowing. If manpower cannot be extracted, livestock must be used instead. It is estimated that 120 man-days will be spent each day to help the masses with the campaign. In addition, it is planned to help the masses dig wells to prevent drought and prepare for famine, and pay attention to promoting and organizing the masses.

    【本报讯】豫北前线培纯同志报导：我太行人民解放军豫北前线部队，积极帮助战区群众春耕下种。仅“清漳”直属部队及其随军参战的民兵、群众，在打汤阴的紧张战斗空隙中，即帮助群众浇地三十一亩，拔草二十七亩，锄地五百七十四亩，刨地八亩半，送粪二千二百五十三担又五十大车。并注意有计划的节约与代替群众帮助军队的差务。领导上为进一步贯彻突击春耕下种，日前集会决定依各部不同情况抽出百分之十五至三十的人力，争取利用战争空隙，或从紧张的战争中挤出时间帮助群众突击春耕下种。抽不出人力时，必须以畜力代之。约计每天将有一百二十个人工参加帮助群众突击。此外并拟帮助群众打井防旱备荒，并注意推动与组织群众。
