　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st. Today is International Labor Day, May 1st, and the people in all liberated areas will hold enthusiastic gatherings to commemorate it. In Harbin, Northeast China, all of the more than 18,000 organized workers were formed into regiments, battalions, and companies, and held an unprecedented grand parade yesterday (the 30th). The workers' armed self-defense forces also carried out various drills and performances. Workers in the Railway Locomotive Section of the Zhengtai Railway are preparing to have the newly equipped "Mao Zedong" and "Zhu De" locomotives lead more than 200 Yangko dancers around the city for publicity today. Workers at the Jingxing Coal Mine on the Zhengtai Road, which was liberated less than half a month ago, are working with the democratic government to form a mine area management committee to quickly restore mining and increase production to welcome "May Day." The Weishui Power Plant, located fifty li southeast of the mining area, is already transmitting 5,000 kilowatts of electricity as usual for use in the Jingxing Mine and the city. The more than 5,000 workers in the plant are also celebrating their first own festival after liberation with revelry today. Workers in the Luzhong Military Factory in Shandong Province are supporting the front lines with highly over-fulfilled production, with 48% of the workers being honored on the People's Roll of Honor to welcome "May Day." Currently, in addition to increasing working hours to 14 hours per day, workers in the factory have also donated 120,000 jin of food and 2,210,000 yuan worth of clothes and shoes to the front lines to comfort the troops. The Jinnan Workers' Congress has set up a support-the-front-lines box on the streets of Linqing City, and workers throughout the city are wrapping money and daily necessities, writing their names on them, and putting them into the box. Automotive workers will load a large number of supplies to comfort the troops and drive to the front lines.
