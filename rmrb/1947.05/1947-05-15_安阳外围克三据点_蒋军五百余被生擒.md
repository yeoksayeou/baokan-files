　　Xinhua News Agency, Yubei Front, 12th: A certain unit of the Yubei People's Liberation Army captured the strongholds of Sanguanmiao, Qingliu, and Hujiazhuang, northeast, due north, and northwest of Anyang City on the 9th and 10th, wiping out a portion of the transportation battalion of the 39th Brigade of Chiang's 40th Division, and the entire Chiang-affiliated Linzhang Neihuang Security Regiment. A total of dozens of enemies were killed and over 500 were captured alive.

　　This newspaper's Yubei Front, 12th: The emancipated masses of Licheng, Taihang, automatically elected a comfort delegation, carrying 1 million yuan, 571 comfort bags, and over 300 comfort letters, and arrived at the front yesterday to express their regards to the People's Liberation Army. The comfort delegation visited various detachments and reported the situation of the masses' emancipation in the rear, as well as the masses' sincere concern for the families of soldiers after their emancipation, at military conferences. The comfort delegation read out to everyone the property allocated to the families of Licheng soldiers in the unit one by one. Comrade Liang Liantang, a model worker and cook squad leader of the 9th detachment, said with great emotion: "The government and the villagers have always been good to me. This time, they gave me a plot of land and many things. I am very satisfied. I will never go home until Chiang Kai-shek is eliminated." The comfort delegation greatly enlightened and educated the newly liberated soldiers. In the past, they were often skeptical about the land reform, preferential treatment for the families of revolutionary soldiers and honorably discharged soldiers in the liberated areas. After hearing the report and seeing the statistics on the distribution of fruits and preferential treatment received by the families of comrades in Licheng, they said enviously: "The liberated area is good. It would be great if my family could be like this too!" The new liberated soldiers of the training team said: "This side is really stronger than that side. The families have turned themselves around, receive preferential treatment, and the government provides resettlement for veterans. They came so far to express their regards. I have never heard of this over there." The comfort delegation solicited the opinions of the soldiers on the government separately, and stated that they would take the heroes' commendation lists back home to congratulate their families.

　　安阳外围克三据点
    蒋军五百余被生擒
    【新华社豫北前线十二日电】豫北人民解放军某部于九、十两日攻克安阳城东北、正北及西北之三官庙、清流、胡家庄三据点，歼蒋军四○师三九旅辎重营一部，及蒋记临漳内黄保安团全部。共毙敌数十名，生俘五百余。
    【本报豫北前线十二日电】太行黎城翻身群众自动推选慰问团，携款一百万元、五百七十一个慰问袋、三百余封慰问信，已于昨日到达前方慰问人民解放军。慰问团分别到各支队慰问，并在军人大会上报告后方群众翻身情形，及群众翻身后对军属的真诚关切。慰问团把该部黎城战士们家中所分到的财产一一念给大家听。九分队模范工作者炊事班长梁连堂同志十分感慨的说：“政府和乡亲一向对我就好，这次又分给我一个场和很多东西，我很满意，不消灭蒋介石我是决不回家的。慰问团对新解放战士启发教育甚大，过去他们对解放区的土地改革、优待革命军人家属和荣退军人，”常是半信半疑，这次听了报告，看了黎城同志家庭分果实、受优待的统计表后，他们羡慕的说：“解放区就是好，啥时候我们家也这样就好啦！”教导队新解放战士说：“这边真比那边强，家庭翻了身，受优待，退伍政府还给安家。这么远的跑来慰问，在那边听也没听说过。”慰问团分头征求战士对政府的意见，并表示把英雄的报功单带回家去向家属贺功。
