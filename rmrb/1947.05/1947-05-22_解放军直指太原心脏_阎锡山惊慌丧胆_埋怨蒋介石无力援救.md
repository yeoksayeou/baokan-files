Xinhua News Agency, Jin察冀 [Chahar-Hebei] 19th Telegram: A unit of the Jin察冀 [Chahar-Hebei] People's Liberation Army, on the 7th, 8th, and 9th, successively captured the important strongholds of the Yan army, Shibei, Pingtou, Tai'an驿 [post station], and Shitie villages and towns, about sixty li east of Taiyuan. Annihilated a part of the Yan stubborn 49th Division, 3rd Regiment, and a part of the puppet self-defense corps. Preliminary statistics show that 296 Yan and puppet troops were captured alive, and 13 light artillery pieces, 6 light machine guns, and 123 rifles were seized.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th Telegram: The victories of the People's Liberation Army in Southern Shanxi and on the Zhengtai Line have caused Yan stubborns to panic and lose courage. Yan Xishan himself, at the Taiyuan "Headquarters Committee," repeatedly lamented that "the Communist army is besieging Taiyuan," and that he has "determined to coexist and perish with the city," and called on everyone to implement the so-called "total mobilization of all," and ordered that "absolutely no third kind of neutral person (i.e., those who do not support him) is allowed to exist." Yan's newspaper *Fuxing Daily* published an editorial earlier this month stating: "In more than twenty days, Southern Shanxi lost seventeen counties (now it should be said nineteen counties). If estimated from an economic and strategic perspective, this loss is indeed not something that can be compensated by recovering Northern Shaanxi... The military authorities do not have a foolproof plan for Southern Shanxi, and it cannot be said that this is not a major mistake... and we hear no news from the government (referring to Chiang Kai-shek) about anything else in Southern Shanxi, which is truly the greatest regret." The newspaper also exclaimed, "The prelude to the Jinzhong battle is about to begin, and it may determine the fate of the country." Yan stubborns expressed extreme complaints and dissatisfaction with Chiang Kai-shek's inability to provide support. At the Yan-sponsored Provincial Senate, they publicly criticized Dong Xian光 [Guang], Director of Chiang Kai-shek's News Bureau, for saying that "the military situation in Shanxi is in fact not as serious as reported by some newspapers," believing that the situation in Shanxi is indeed extremely serious.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th Telegram: According to news from the Tianjin *Ta Kung Pao*: Public opinion in the Chiang area highly praised the brilliant achievements of our mobile warfare. An observer also compared our initiative to withdraw from Yan'an, which trapped Hu Zongnan in an inextricable quagmire, and at the same time our recovery of seventeen (now nineteen) county towns in Southern Shanxi in twenty days, to the Communist army discarding a dry bone in exchange for a fat cow. It is also said that the materials seized in the recovery of the seventeen county towns can be used for ten years.

　　解放军直指太原心脏
    阎锡山惊慌丧胆
    埋怨蒋介石无力援救
    【新华社晋察冀十九日电】晋察冀人民解放军一部，于七、八、九三日连续攻克太原以东约六十里之阎军重要据点石河、坪头、太安驿、什贴村镇。歼灭阎顽四九师三团一部及伪自卫团一部，初步统计生俘阎伪军二百九十六名，缴轻炮十三门，轻机枪六挺，步枪一百二十三支。
    【新华社陕北十九日电】人民解放军在晋南及正太线上的胜利，已使阎顽惊慌丧胆。阎锡山本人在太原“首脑部委会”上，一再悲号“共军围攻太原”，他已“决心与城共存亡”，要大家实行所谓“全体总动员”，并下令“绝对不允许第三种中立的人（按即不拥护他的人）存在。”阎顽机关报《复兴日报》上旬发表社论称：“在二十余天中，晋南丢了十七县（按现在应该说十九县），如以经济与战略估计，这个损失的确不是收复陕北所能补偿的，……军事当局对于晋南没有一个万全的部署，不能说不是大大的失策…也听不到政府（按指蒋介石）对于晋南其他的一点消息，诚属最大的遗憾。”该报又惊呼“晋中大战的序幕快要开始，可能决定国家的命运。”阎顽对蒋介石的无力支援，极表埋怨不满，阎记省参议会上，对蒋记新闻局长董显光所说“山西军事情势事实上不如若干报纸所报导之严重”，予以公开抨击，认为山西情况实在异常严重。
    【新华社陕北廿日电】据天津大公报消息：蒋区舆论界倍赞我运动战的辉煌成果。某观察家并对我主动撤出延安，使胡宗南陷于不拔泥沼，同时对我在晋南二十天收复十七座（按：现在已是十九座）县城，譬如共军丢掉一块干骨头换来一只肥牛。又谓留在收复十七座县城所缴物资，可供十年之用。
