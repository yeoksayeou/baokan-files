Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 10th: The Yellow River Joint Defense Militia of more than ten counties in the Jiluyu area recently accused Chiang Kai-shek's troops to the world of the conspiracy and crime of stealing and fraudulently killing people. It is reported that on the morning of April 19, Pei Shangyun, the person in charge of the 375th Regiment of the Chiang Kai-shek's army in Changyuan, sent someone to contact the river defense militia in the seventh district of Changyuan with the business card of Zhao Mingfu, the representative of the Yellow River Commission of the Jiluyu District stationed in Bian, falsely claiming that the UN relief supplies had arrived and asked the militia to receive them. The militia went as agreed, but was suddenly attacked by Chiang Kai-shek's troops who had ambushed in advance. One militiaman was killed and a pistol was robbed. According to investigations from various sources, the business card was exchanged between Zhao Mingfu and the person in charge of the Chiang Kai-shek's army in Changyuan when Zhao Mingfu accompanied Fan Mingde and Han Sen of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to inspect the river embankment in the lower reaches of the Yellow River on April 18.
