Xinhua News Agency, Northeast China, 28th: The military and civilians of Hua (dian) Nan have stubbornly persisted in guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines against Chiang Kai-shek. Over the past seven months, they have created a base area behind enemy lines. In late August of last year, under the frantic attack of Chiang Kai-shek's troops, the Hua Nan guerrillas and the Hua Dian county and district governments, based on the principle of "districts not leaving districts, counties not leaving counties," crossed the river and went deep behind enemy lines. In the environment of being besieged by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, they first expelled the bandits from Wobo. Based on the opinions of the masses, they executed Chen Xiba, a big bad element who colluded with the enemy and bandits, as well as bandit leaders Chen Zhongyou (Jiujiang Hao) and Zhao Dexiang, etc. They then crushed the enemy's intelligence network. More than a dozen "upper-class figures" who had fled to the Chiang-occupied areas were moved back to the guerrilla area. All enemy strongholds outside Hua Dian city have received letters, newspapers, and leaflets from the guerrillas. The guerrillas have also received replies from Chiang Kai-shek's soldiers expressing their unwillingness to fight in the civil war. In the months since the victory in the grain protection struggle last autumn, more than 6,000 jin of electric poles alone have been harvested. The enemy fearfully says: "The people in the ravines have all rebelled." The militia and guerrillas have sheltered the land reform of the masses and the rest and reorganization of the main forces, and have helped the government with relief work. During this period, many people in the Chiang-occupied areas secretly sent public grain to the guerrillas, and one family of five fathers and sons joined the Democratic Allied Army. The guerrillas have grown stronger and stronger in the struggle, and their numbers have increased fortyfold compared to the beginning of crossing the river. Initially, the scope of activities was limited to eight tribes. Now, in addition to a fixed guerrilla base area of more than forty tribes, there are also guerrilla areas of more than twenty tribes.

　　东北桦南创游击根据地
    【新华社东北二十八日电】桦（甸）南军民顽强坚持蒋后游击战争，七个月来，已创造了敌后根据地。去年八月下旬，在蒋军疯狂进攻下，桦南游击队与桦甸县区政府根据“区不离区，县不离县”的原则，渡江深入敌后，在蒋匪夹击的环境中，首先驱逐窝堡的土匪，根据群众意见，枪毙通敌通匪的大坏蛋陈喜巴，土匪头子陈中有（九江好）和赵德祥等，继则粉碎了敌人的情报网。逃亡到蒋区的十几家“上层人物”，迁回游击区来。桦甸城外所有敌据点，都曾收到过游击队的信件、书报和传单、游击队也曾收到过蒋军士兵痛述自己不愿打内战的回信。从去秋取得了护粮斗争胜利之后几个月来，仅电线杆即已收割六千余斤之多。敌人恐惧的传说着：“沟里的人都反了”。民兵游击队掩护了群众的土地改革与主力部队的休整，并帮助政府进行了救济工作，在这期间，蒋占区不少群众给游击队偷送公粮，有一家父子五人参加民主联军。游击队在斗争中日益壮大，人数比过江之初发展了四十倍。最初活动范围，只限于八个部落，现在除有四十多个部落的固定游击根据地外，还有二十多个部落的游击区。
