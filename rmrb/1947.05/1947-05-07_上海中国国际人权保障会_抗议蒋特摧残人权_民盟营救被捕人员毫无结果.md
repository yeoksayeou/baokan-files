Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd: The Shanghai press reported on April 11th: The China International Human Rights Protection Association issued an appeal to all citizens to protest the Chiang faction's trampling of human rights. The article stated: At a time when world democracy is on the rise, China is constantly witnessing the trampling of human rights, which has recently intensified. Kuomintang military police in Guangzhou, Beiping, Xi'an, and other places, under the pretext of anti-communism, have illegally arrested innocent civilians, with numbers ranging from two thousand to six or seven thousand. Newspapers and bookstores in various places have been closed and destroyed, magazines have been sealed, and associations have been interfered with. All human freedoms have been deprived. In particular, this series of heinous crimes occurred after the Kuomintang promulgated the constitution (i.e., the pseudo-constitution). If such crimes are allowed to develop, China's international status will regress to that of Spain. Finally, the association put forward the following demands: (1) All people illegally detained in various places must be released immediately and given full compensation. (2) The military police authorities and party members who illegally arrested people must be severely punished. (3) Officials who have not actively fulfilled their duty to protect human rights must be disciplined. (4) The closed newspapers and bookstores must be unsealed immediately, given full compensation, and the rioters must be brought to justice, and publication must be permitted. (5) The rioters who interfered with gatherings must be investigated and dealt with, and the victims must be given full compensation, and those who interfered with and obstructed gatherings must be given due punishment. (6) The government guarantees that similar incidents will never happen again. The association's directors, Zhang Naiqi, Liu Wang Liming, and others, recently hosted people from all walks of life to protest the special agents' arrests.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th: According to a compilation of Shanghai press reports: Democratic League leaders Du Bincheng, Wang Nanren, Luo Binji, and others illegally arrested by Chiang Kai-shek's special agents in Xi'an, Shenyang, and other places. The League sent Luo Longji and Zhang Bojun to Nanjing in mid-April to rescue them. After two weeks, they met with Zheng Jiemin, Lei Zhen, Shao Lizi, and others separately, but to no avail. Chiang Kai-shek's special agents are currently fabricating various excuses to destroy democratic organizations, and such incidents will apparently increase. According to a Shanghai report on the 4th: Chen Huachi (transliteration) of the American newspaper "Millard's Review" recently wrote an article criticizing the recent illegal arrests by Chiang Kai-shek's special agents in Shanghai, stating: All these arrests were made without warrants at the time, and no written or oral notice was given to the families of the victims afterward. The relatives of these unfortunate people have tried desperately to negotiate with the police station and the military police headquarters, but all efforts have been in vain. The author concludes that, in reality, there is currently no personal protection law in China.

Furthermore, Chiang Kai-shek has a large-scale concentration camp in Tianning Temple, Changzhou, Jiangsu. The temple has more than 5,000 ordinary guest rooms, where Communist Party members, democrats, and innocent farmers arrested by the "encirclement and suppression" departments along the Beijing-Shanghai line and in northern Jiangsu are imprisoned. According to the villagers around the temple: the sounds of miserable cries can be heard all night long; it is estimated that at least two or three hundred people are killed every day, and there is no space to bury the numerous corpses, so they are dissolved with chemicals.

　　上海中国国际人权保障会
    抗议蒋特摧残人权
    民盟营救被捕人员毫无结果
    【新华社陕北三日电】四月十一日沪报讯：中国国际人权保障会为抗议蒋党摧残人权，向全国公民发出呼吁。该文略称：正当世界民主主义抬头之际，中国竟不断发生蹂躏人权事实，到最近更变本加厉，国民党军警在广州、北平、西安等地，竟借反共为名，违法逮捕无辜平民，人数由二千至六七千不等，各地报馆书店被禁闭、捣毁，杂志被查封，结社被干涉，人类的一切自由均被剥夺。特别是这一连串滔天罪行，竟发生在国民党颁布宪法（按即伪宪）之后，这种罪行如任其发展，中国国际地位将退到西班牙之下。最后该会提出下列要求：（一）各地被非法拘捕人民必须立即释放并予以充分的赔偿。（二）非法拘捕人民的军警当局及党团分子必须予以严厉惩罚。（三）未积极尽保护人权职责的官吏必须加以处分。（四）被封闭的报馆书店必须即日启封，予以充分赔偿，并缉究暴徒，准予发行。（五）究办干涉集会的暴徒，并予被害者充分之赔偿费，更予干涉阻碍集会者以应得处分。（六）政府保证今后决不发生同类事情。该会理事章乃器、刘王立明等日前曾为抗议特务捕人事招待各界。
    【新华社陕北五日电】综合沪报消息：蒋特目前在西安沈阳等地非法逮捕之民主同盟负责人杜斌承、王南人、骆宾基等，该盟于前月中旬即派出罗隆基、章伯钧二氏至南京营救，历时二周，曾分别与郑介民、雷震、邵力子等交涉，毫无结果。按蒋特目前正制造各种借口摧残民主组织，此类事件显将日益增加。又据沪四日讯：美报“密勒民评论报”陈华持（译音）氏顷著文抨击最近上海蒋特非法捕人事称：所有这些逮捕，当时既无拘票，事后又无书面或口头通知给与受害者家属。这些不幸者的亲人已拚命努力，至警察局及宪兵司令部交涉，但全属无效。作者结论说：实际上中国现已无人身保障法存在。
    又讯：蒋介石于江苏常州天宁寺设有大规模集中营，该寺仅普通客房约有五千余间，凡京、沪沿线及苏北等地“清剿”部所逮捕之共产党员、民主人士及无辜农民均禁闭其中。据该寺周围乡民谈：惨号之声，彻夜可闻；估计每天杀人至少在二三百以上，尸骨之多，无隙埋藏，竟用药水化去。
