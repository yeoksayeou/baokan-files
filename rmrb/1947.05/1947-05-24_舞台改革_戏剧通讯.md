　　Stage Reform
　　Drama Correspondence
　　Many cultural work troupes, drama troupes, and propaganda teams active on the Jilu Yu front of self-defense have boldly reformed the stage itself when reflecting the reality of the self-defense war on stage.
　　Many stage designs unsuitable for the front line, along with their props, those things of peaceful life, have been swept away from the stage. Many realistic scenes of the front line—bunkers, barricades, stockades—have been moved onto the stage.
　　These realistic scenes of struggle unceremoniously occupied the stage, disregarding protests about "destroying the stage atmosphere," and broke through the old stage framework. For example, when the Forward Drama Society performed "Zhang Fengji," the backdrop was removed, and the backstage was set to the side of the stage. Thus, the audience no longer saw a piece of blue cloth covering the backstage but could see the background where the events occurred and progressed—the often pitch-black nights of the Jilu Yu plain, and if lucky, could even see the stars and moonlight. Heroic struggles and the joy of victory... took place in such a night scene. This reform was quickly adopted by the cultural work troupes and the 2-1 Propaganda Team. Once, when a cultural work troupe performed "Lü Dengke," the audience cheered when they saw a young new soldier from a peasant background crawling forward with skilled and beautiful postures under the night sky. Subsequently, the battle scene in "Wang Keqin's Squad" also had the backdrop removed. The beautiful pyramid-shaped sorghum stalks, unique to the Jilu Yu plain, appeared on stage when the 2-1 Propaganda Team performed "The Night of Zhang Fengji" (a two-act play), squeezing the dense cloth curtains mercilessly to the side. Actors entered and exited between the sorghum stalks, making the scene appear real and beautiful.
　　In the stage reform, many difficulties were also overcome. Many comrades unanimously promoted bringing war scenes onto the stage, which had never been successful before. But now, everything has been swept into the war, and heroism emerges in battle. Therefore, large-scale firepower effects have been incorporated, with collapsing walls and flames spewing from bunker firing holes vividly displayed on the stage, and music is used to create the atmosphere of the battlefield.

　　舞台改革
    戏剧通讯
    在冀鲁豫自卫前线活动的好些文工团、剧团、宣传队，当他们在舞台上反映自卫战争的现实时，对舞台本身进行了大胆的改革。
    许多不适合前线的舞台设计连同它的道具，那些和平生活里的事物，从舞台上扫除了。前线的许多现实景物——地堡、工事鹿柴、寨墙、被搬上了舞台。
    这些现实的斗争景物，不客气地霸占了舞台，不顾所谓“破坏舞台气氛”的抗议，把旧有的舞台框子冲破了。如前进剧社上演《张凤集》时，把天幕撤去，把后台设到舞台侧面去，这样，观众再不是看见一块蓝布遮着后台，能够望见事件发生和进行的背景——冀鲁豫平原常有的漆黑的夜，碰巧还可以看见星星和月光，英勇的斗争和胜利的喜悦……，就在这样的夜景中发生。这种改革，很快为文工团和二一宣传队所采用。一次文工团演《吕登科》时，观众看着一个翻身农民出身的青年新战士在夜幕下的熟练美丽的姿态匍匐前进而喝起采来。接着上演《王克勤班》的战斗场面，也把天幕撤去了。冀鲁豫平原所特有的美丽的金字塔形的高粱般尖塔，在二一宣传队上演“张凤集之夜”（二幕话剧）时，出现在舞台上，把密密的布条幕，毫不怜惜的挤在旁边，演员从高粱秆尖塔之间出场进场，这样的画面，显得真实而美丽。
    在舞台改革中，也克服了好些困难。好些工作同志都异口同声的宣传战争场面搬上舞台，是从没成功过的。但现在，一切都被卷进战争了，英雄主义是在战斗中出现的。因此大景的火力效果，被吸收进来了，墙壁的倒塌和地堡射击孔喷出的火舌，也活摆在舞台上了，并且用音乐来创造战场的气氛。（仁）
