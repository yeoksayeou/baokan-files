　　【Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 14th】 Since spring, the Jin-Sui region has experienced a lack of rain, presenting drought conditions. Beginning on the 5th, all organizations in the border region are saving two liang (approximately 70 grams) of rice per person per day, and reducing the number of soldiers and horses. In addition to guaranteeing the original production tasks, it is advocated that each person plant an additional five to ten pumpkin plants. Furthermore, a large number of laborers and livestock are being deployed to help poor farmers plant cotton and make soil blocks, ensuring that newly land-obtained farmers can plant in a timely manner. A surge of well-digging and canal-building has swept across areas where peasants received land; the masses in Tufang Village, Guoxian County, have already opened a canal more than 300 zhang (approximately 1000 meters) long, irrigating more than 300 mu (approximately 20 hectares) of land. Farmers in Gaojia Village, Xingxian County, who have obtained land have established six docks along the river, irrigating the land day and night to plant cotton. Baode and other places are actively educating the masses to overcome their reliance on rain and to engage in rush planting. Old men, women, and children are all gathering poplar leaves, sweet herbs, and other items in groups to prepare for hardship.

　　晋绥各地掀起
    防旱抢种节约备荒
    【新华社晋绥十四日电】晋绥各地入春未雨，已呈旱象。边区各机关自五日起，每人每一天即节约二两米，减缩兵员马匹。除保证原定生产任务外，提倡每人增种五棵至十棵南瓜。并抽出大批劳畜力帮助贫苦群众干种棉花、打土块，保证新得地农民及时下种。各地得地农民打井开渠已成热潮；崞县土芳村群众已开成长三百余丈水渠一条，灌田三百余亩。兴县高家村得地农民已沿河建立起码头六座，日夜浇地种棉。保德等地正积极教育群众克服等雨思想，进行抢种。各地老汉、妇女、儿童均成群结伙采集杨叶、甜晋等备荒。
