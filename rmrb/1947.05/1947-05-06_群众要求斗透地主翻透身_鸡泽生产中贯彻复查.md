　　The Masses Demand Thoroughly Struggling Against Landlords to Achieve Complete Liberation
    Thorough Review Implemented in Production in Jize
    [Report from our Jinnan Office on the 3rd] Jize is conducting a review in conjunction with production. The county, after investigating villages such as Huang Gou, Xiao Zhai, and Chengnan Street, discovered that in villages that were consistently considered "thorough," the masses had not completely achieved liberation. Consequently, they delved into peasant households and listened to the opinions of the masses. Ordinary peasants reflected: "The struggle against landlords was too lenient, and the land we were allocated was not good; the landlords kept all the good land." "During the struggle, village cadres were afraid of trouble and didn't call on people to speak out one by one. We haven't said everything we wanted to say, and the landlords' prestige hasn't been crushed. Even now, the landlords are still making sarcastic remarks. You (referring to the leadership) only tell cadres and the masses to resolve conflicts, but you don't ask whether the struggle against landlords has been thorough. It would be best if you led us to thoroughly struggle against the landlords, until they don't dare to make sarcastic remarks." The leadership approved these demands from the masses, emphasizing the implementation of the review in production. Following this, the masses in each village launched a process of deliberation and connection, creating the "four comparisons" method—comparing clothing, food, housing, and land—to further deepen the struggle. Many masses said: "They say we've been liberated, but if you add up all our property, it's not even worth a landlord's gate." Currently, each village has begun a thorough reckoning with the landlords.
    [Report from our Jinnan Office on the 2nd] Jize's Fudong Village launched a movement to mobilize the "backward" to thoroughly struggle against the landlords. After the district leadership cadres arrived in the village, on the one hand, they educated village cadres and activists to overcome their aversion to the "backward" masses, explaining that if these "backward" and impoverished masses could not achieve liberation, the land reform could not be completed. At the same time, they personally visited the "backward" masses and discovered that some felt unjustified and lacked confidence living in landlords' houses, planning to sell the houses at a cheap price. Some had been allocated houses without foundations, and they didn't have time to rebuild, and if they sold them, they would have no place to live, which was very worrying. Some wanted to live in the landlords' good houses but were unwilling to move in immediately, fearing a "change of regime." Some wanted the houses themselves but were unwilling to say so, fearing offending the landlords, and wanted everyone to evaluate and give them the houses. Some had fatalistic ideas, saying, "External wealth doesn't enrich poor people." Based on this investigation, the county, district, and village cadres concentrated their efforts. On the one hand, they enlightened the masses according to their different ideas. On the other hand, they specifically convened a symposium of forty-two honest and impoverished masses, thoroughly educating them about various backward ideas. After their thinking gradually awakened, they were called upon to launch a thorough reckoning movement against the landlords. The formerly "backward" peasants now dared to want the landlords' houses and land. Currently, this movement is continuing to deepen.

　　群众要求斗透地主翻透身
    鸡泽生产中贯彻复查
    【本报冀南三日电】鸡泽结合生产开展复查。该县经过对黄沟、小寨、城南街等村调查，发现一贯认为“彻底”村庄，群众并没彻底翻身。遂深入农户，倾听群众意见，一般农民反映：“对地主斗的轻，我们分的地不好，地主净剩好地”。“斗争时村干部怕麻烦，不叫一个个来诉苦，我们有话还未说尽，地主的威风还没打垮，到现在地主还说风凉话。你们（指领导上）光叫干群解圪瘩，不问地主斗争彻底没有。最好领导我们把地主斗透，一直斗到地主不敢说风凉话。”领导上批准了群众这些要求，强调在生产中贯彻复查。接着各村群众即展开酝酿串连，创造了比衣裳，比吃食，比房屋，比土地的“四比”办法，深入一步开展斗争。很多群众说：“说是翻身了，把财产一下算上，还不如地主一个大门值钱”。目前各村已开始对地主进行彻底清算。
    【本报冀南二日电】鸡泽浮东村展开发动“落后”斗透地主运动。区领导干部到了该村，一方面教育村干积极分子克服对“落后”群众的厌恶心理，说明这些“落后”贫苦群众如翻不了身，便不能完成土地改革，同时并亲自深入“落后”群众访问，发现有人对住地主房子觉着理不直、气不壮，分了房子打算贱价卖出。有的分了房子没有地基，从新拆盖没有工夫，卖了以后又没房住，很发愁。有的愿住地主的好房，又不愿马上住，有“变天”顾虑；有的自己愿要房，但不愿说出来，怕得罪地主，愿叫大家评议给他；有的有宿命思想，说“外财不富命穷人”。据此检查，县区村干部集中力量，一方面根据群众不同思想，分别进行启发。一方面专门召开四十二户老实贫苦群众座谈会，对各种落后思想作了彻底教育。在他们思想渐渐觉悟后，即号召开展对地主的彻底清算运动，过去的“落后”农民，这时都敢要与想要地主的房地了。现这一运动正继续深入中。
