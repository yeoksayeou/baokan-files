Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th: A Xinhua News Agency reporter commented on the annihilation of Hu Zongnan's troops in Panlong, stating: "After our Northwest People's Liberation Army annihilated the 135th Brigade of Hu's army on April 14th, we pointed out long ago that regardless of whether Hu Zongnan continued his offensive or switched to defense, his arrogance would decline from then on, and the war situation in the Northwest had reached a turning point. After April 14th, the Northwest People's Liberation Army then attacked Hu's army in the Yongping area on the 19th, annihilating over a thousand enemies. At that time, the People's Liberation Army under the command of our General Chen Geng was displaying great power in the Jinan triangular area, recovering many cities. Since Hu Zongnan's efforts in the Northwest battlefield were fruitless, and the rear was indeed becoming strained, he hesitated about his actions. However, Chiang Kai-shek urgently needed morphine needles to constantly stimulate morale. Under this demand, Hu's army scraped together nine and a half brigades on April 26th, and fled from Panlong through Wayaobao towards Suide and Mizhi, aiming to clear the Yan'an-Yulin highway, join forces with Deng Baoshan, and drive the People's Liberation Army across the eastern bank of the Yellow River. Panlong was an important stronghold of Hu's army and a general supply station. Hu Zongnan left the headquarters of the 167th Brigade of the main First Division and the 499th Regiment to guard the area, along with a security corps and the rear of various units, totaling more than 7,000 people. Hu Zongnan also ordered Deng Baoshan's army and its 28th Brigade in Yulin to advance from the north, occupy Xiangshui, Boluo, and Xicha, and flee towards Mizhi and Jiaxian, promising to join forces with Deng Baoshan. When the main force of Hu's army advanced from the Panlong area towards Suide, the People's Liberation Army watched them staggering through the mountains, each soldier carrying weapons, working tools, backpacks, and nine days of dry rations, wearing tattered cotton clothes that exposed their backs and buttocks, looking clumsy and ragged like bears. They specifically chose to climb up and down the loess mountains without roads, and the weather seemed to deliberately antagonize Hu Zongnan. When Hu's army was advancing, there was a heavy rain, making each of Hu's soldiers roll like drenched chickens and fall like mud bodhisattvas. Hu's army marched for a week, arriving in Suide on May 2nd. The main force of the People's Liberation Army, however, had eaten their fill and slept soundly, and on the same day, May 2nd, surrounded Panlong. The main force of Hu's army, hearing of the crisis in the rear, did not go to Mizhi or the Yellow River, but spun around Suide like ants on a hot pot for three days. In these three days, the People's Liberation Army captured Panlong. As a result, the main force of Hu's army and the garrison troops were shocked as if they had been electrocuted. The garrison troops were all in danger, losing confidence in the fortifications, complaining that Hu Zongnan had reduced the garrison troops too much. If strongholds like Panlong were so easily opened, then now each of the strongholds Hu Zongnan had assigned only had a regiment or a battalion of troops. Who knew when it would be their turn to be unlucky? The main force carried out several large-scale armed parades, and each parade resulted in the elimination of a part of Hu's army. This parade was particularly long, particularly heavy, and particularly difficult. It would have been better if they hadn't paraded, but once they did, Panlong was lost. The food, which had only been brought for nine days, was completely eaten, and not much grain could be robbed. After Panlong was captured, they were facing starvation. The greatest shock was to Hu Zongnan himself: he had boasted to reporters that he would meet them in Suide in May; he had boasted to Deng Baoshan that he would join forces with him; he had boasted to Chiang Kai-shek about how he was winning battles. What to do now? Three strategies: one was to be a hero to the end and continue north to clear Yan'an-Yulin; one was to leave troops to defend Suide and turn the main force south; and the last, and most embarrassing, and most disheartening, was not to defend Suide and flee back completely. The People's Liberation Army liberated Panlong on the night of May 4th. Hu Zongnan made a decision, adopting the most disheartening strategy, ordering his nine and a half brigades not to defend Suide and to flee back completely from the 5th. He left Deng Baoshan, who was eagerly preparing to join forces, hanging in mid-air, unable to go up or down, but this play is not over yet, and the good戏 [xì] a play; drama; show; stage is yet to come. On the one hand, the People's Liberation Army routed the 84th Brigade, which was sent by Hu Zongnan as reinforcements and attached with tanks, at Qinghuabian, causing them to flee south through the rain and night, and is now chasing the fleeing enemy, approaching the suburbs of Yan'an; on the other hand, the main force of Hu's army is crawling back to Panlong, starving and trembling, whether they will be able to eat the military rations transported from Xi'an is still unknown. The development of the Northwest war situation fully proves our assertion that Hu's army's arrogance is declining, and Hu Zongnan's incompetent command is making this decline come faster, more dramatically, and more theatrically. Let us write a doggerel:

	Hu barbarians, Hu barbarians, are useless,
	The Yan'an-Yulin highway cannot be cleared,
	Panlong is lost, Suide is lost,
	A parade is empty on both ends!
	Six thousand officers and soldiers become prisoners,
	Nine and a half brigades are like bears;
	Causing Deng Baoshan in Yulin to suffer,
	Hanging in mid-air, unable to go up or down.

　　犯绥德胡军狼狈弃城南窜
    人民解放军迫近延安城郊
    新华社记者纵论陕北战局
    【新华社陕北八日电】新华社记者评蟠龙胡宗南军的被歼称：四月十四日我西北人民解放军歼灭胡军一三五旅之后，我们早就指出：不管胡宗南此后继续进攻或者转为防御，他的凶焰从此下降，西北战局已经到了转折点。十四日之后，西北人民解放军接着于十九日在永坪地区进攻胡军，歼敌千余。当时我陈赓将军所部的人民解放军，在晋南三角地区大展威力，光复了许多城市。胡宗南在西北战场既然劳而无功，后方又着实吃紧起来，对于自己的行动曾踌躇了一番，但是蒋介石急迫需要吗啡针来不断刺激士气。在这个要求之下，胡军于四月二十六日凑出了九个半旅，由蟠龙经瓦窑堡向绥德、米脂窜犯，要打通延榆公路，与邓宝珊会师，并把人民解放军赶过黄河东岸去。蟠龙是胡军重要据点，是一个补给的总站口。胡宗南把主力第一师的一六七旅旅部和四九九团留守该地，加上一个保安总队与各部的后方，有七千余人之多。胡宗南又叫邓宝珊军及其在榆林的二十八旅由北面进犯，占领响水、波罗、西岔，并向米脂、葭县窜进，答应要与邓宝珊会师。当胡军主力由蟠龙地区向绥德前进时，人民解放军在山头上看着他们蹒跚通过，每个兵背着武器，工作器具、背包和九天干粮，穿的是露出背脊和屁股的烂棉衣，笨重和褴褛得像狗熊一样。专挑没有道路的黄土高山爬上爬下，天气也好像故意与胡宗南作对，在胡军前进时下了一场透雨，弄得胡军个个滚得像落汤鸡，跌得像泥菩萨。胡军走了一个星期，五月二日到了绥德。人民解放军的主力却吃得饱饱的睡得足足的，也在五月二日这一天把蟠龙包围了起来。胡军主力听得后方危急，米脂也不去了，黄河边上也不去了，像热锅上的蚂蚁在绥德周围转了三天。就在这三天里，人民解放军打下了蟠龙。于是胡军主力与守备部队都像触电似的受到震动。守备部队个个自危，对于工事失掉了信心，埋怨胡宗南把守备兵力放少了。如果蟠龙那样的据点都很容易就打开了，那么现在胡宗南所按下的据点每个只有一团或一营的兵力，谁知道那一天会轮到自己倒霉呢？主力部队武装大游行了好几次，每次游行都有一部胡军被消灭。这次游行路特别远，背得特别重，走得特别苦，不游还罢，一游把个蟠龙游掉了。粮食只带九天已经完全吃光，抢粮又抢不到多少。蟠龙打掉了之后，眼看着要饿饭。震动最大的还是胡宗南自己：他对记者吹过牛说，五月里要在绥德接见他们；他对邓宝珊吹过牛说，要与他会师；他对蒋介石吹过牛说，自已是怎样怎样的打胜仗。现在怎么办呢？三条计策：一条是做好汉做到底，继续北进打通延榆；一条是留兵守住绥德，主力向南回头；再有一条也是最没有面子的一条，最泄气的一条，就是不守绥德全部回窜。人民解放军五月四日夜解放了蟠龙，胡宗南决了策，采取了最泄气的一条，叫他的九个半旅不守绥德，五日起全部回窜。把兴高采烈准备会师的邓宝珊吊在半空中，上不得上，下不得下，但是这一场戏还没有完结，好戏还在后头。一方面人民解放军在青化砭把胡宗南派来的援军附了坦克的八十四旅打得冒雨乘夜南窜，现在正穷追逃敌，迫近延安城郊；另一方面胡军主力正饿着肚子战战兢兢的爬回蟠龙，他们是否能吃得到西安运来的军粮，还在未知之数。西北战局的发展完全证明我们的论断，胡军凶焰是在下降，胡宗南的指挥无能使这个下降来得更快、更剧烈、更富于戏剧性。赋以打油诗云：
    胡蛮胡蛮不中用，
    延榆公路打不通，
    丢了蟠龙丢绥德，
    一趟游行两头空！
    官兵六千当俘虏，
    九个半旅像狗熊；
    害得榆林邓宝珊，
    不上不下半空中。
