　　Anniversary Message

　　The People's Daily, only one year old, has been constantly striving to overcome all kinds of difficulties in terms of manpower and material resources, and it has indeed developed quite strongly. This can be seen from the frequent inquiries about the People's Daily and the eagerness to subscribe to it, which I heard everywhere from the commanders and fighters, district and village cadres, and the broad masses during my tour to comfort the troops last winter. This should be a mass summary of the newspaper's efforts to "serve the people" over the past year!

　　A message to the comrades: From now on, we must sound the loud and majestic bugle call even more, preparing for and welcoming the arrival of the great counter-offensive!
                                              Yang Xiufeng

　　周年献辞
    诞生仅一年的人民日报，不断努力克服着一切人力、物力的困难，确实发育得相当壮大了；这由我去冬周行劳军中，到处听到指战员同志、区村干部与广大群众频繁的问讯人民日报和渴望能够订阅到人民日报的呼声里可以见到。这应是报社同志一年来努力“为人民服务”的一个群众总结！
    寄语同志们：今后，要更加响起嘹亮雄伟的号角，准备与迎接大反攻之到来！
                                              杨秀峰
