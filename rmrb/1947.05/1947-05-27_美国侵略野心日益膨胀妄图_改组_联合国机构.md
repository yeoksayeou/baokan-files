Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th: TASS, Moscow: Zhenli Bao observer Yefgeni Zhukov wrote: The United Nations organization, which was established to promote international cooperation and peace and security, has long been regarded as a constant annoyance by those who are not interested in international cooperation and the consolidation of peace and security. Countries cherish this institution, and anyone who openly promotes opposition to it immediately exposes themselves as enemies of peace. But there are still some people doing this now. It is reported that for several months, there has been a "committee" in New York to "reorganize" the United Nations agencies. The basic views of this committee are to reorganize the Security Council, undermine the "veto power" of major countries on issues related to aggression and preparation for aggression, implement the infamous Baruch Plan for the control of atomic energy, and organize investigative agencies with broad powers to investigate the territories of UN member states. This plan for "reorganizing" the United Nations agencies, formulated in New York, is actually based on the hope of forcibly imposing that well-known plan on the organization. This draft constitutes a plan to eliminate the United Nations agencies based on the principle of equality of members, and a plan to transform the organization into a compliant tool of American policy. Because it is calculated that no country that defends sovereignty would be willing to accept this plan to "reorganize" the United Nations agencies, the committee proposed that the United States establish "special" international agencies with "other countries" to complete this plan. This "committee" in New York, which advocates "reorganizing" international agencies, is not an accidental phenomenon. It reflects the increasing appetite of the American aggressive and monopolistic groups. They are angered and bewildered by the existing international agencies' opposition to aggression. The open imperialist and militarist tendencies that are about to be seen in the United States have encouraged reactionaries and pro-fascists to indulge in painstakingly formulating plans, the purpose of which is to establish such "international" agencies in which imperialists can do whatever they want without scruples. The New York Committee did not limit its activities to New York City; it distributed to California, especially at Stanford University. New arrivals are horrified by the large number of unrepentant German Nazis. This is not surprising: these German fascists have defiled the late President Roosevelt and are openly encouraging the United States to fight the Soviet Union. One can only be surprised by the arrogance shown by the American pro-fascists when they try to hide their warmongering behavior with the chattering of "reorganizing" the United Nations agencies.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th: TASS, New York: It is reported that former U.S. Vice President Wallace delivered a speech to 27,000 listeners in Hollywood, once again denouncing the Truman Doctrine. Wallace questioned "Truman's hypocritical assertion" that "the people of the world are begging the United States for tanks and guns to resist the aggressors of totalitarianism." He said: The self-reliance of the Truman Doctrine is more about the rearmament of the world than the welfare of the world, and it is about supporting various anti-Soviet governments without restriction. Wallace declared that the people of the world need organizations for peace. He said: Peace under the United Nations means: "World economic reconstruction under the United Nations, the mandatory control of atomic energy by the United Nations, disarmament under the United Nations and the internationalization of strategic positions, and the full and wholehearted support of the United Nations organization by all countries."

### 美国侵略野心日益膨胀妄图“改组”联合国机构

　　美国侵略野心日益膨胀妄图“改组”联合国机构
    【新华社陕北廿四日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报观察家埃夫根尼·朱可夫撰文略称：为增进国际合作及和平安全的联合国机构，早已经被那些对国际合作和巩固和平安全并无兴趣的人们看做是经常的烦恼。各国珍重这个机构，而任何公开宣传反对它的人们，都立即暴露出他们是和平的敌人。但是现在仍旧有某一部分人在如此做。据悉，已经有好几个月了，纽约存在着要“改组”联合国机构的“委员会”。这个委员会的基本观点是重组安理会，破坏主要国家对关于侵略及准备侵略的问题的“否决权”，实现臭名昭彰的巴鲁区管制原子能计划，组织调查机构，用广大的权力去调查联合国会员国的领土。这个在纽约制定的为“改组”联合国机构的“委员会”的计划，实际是基于下一希望：把那为众人熟知的计划强制加诸于这个机构上。这个草案构成了消灭建基于会员平等原则上的联合国机构的计划，构成了转变这个机构成为美国政策的顺从工具的计划。因为计算到没有一个维护主权的国家愿意接受这个“重组”联合国机构的计划，于是委员会就提议：美国同“其他各国”建立“特别”国际机构去完成这个计划。这个“改组”国际机构之鼓吹者纽约的“委员会”并非偶然的现象，它反映出美国侵略独占集团的日益提高的胃口。他们为现存国际机构之反对侵略所激怒，而且困惑了。在美国将要看得出来的公开的帝国主义同军国主义倾向鼓舞了反动派同亲法西斯分子们沉缅于苦心制定计划，这种计划的目的就在于设立这样的“国际”机构，在其中帝国主义分子能够毫无顾忌的为所欲为。纽约委员会并未限制其活动于纽约城，它分布到加利佛尼亚州，尤其在斯丹福大学内。新去的人，为大批尚未悔过的德国纳粹分子而感到惊恐。这并不奇怪：这些德国法西斯党徒沾污了故总统罗斯福，而且正公开怂恿美国去打苏联。人们只奇怪于美国亲法西斯分子们，当企图去用“改组”联合国机构的喋喋哓舌去隐藏他们的战争贩子行为时所表现的那种横蛮。
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】塔斯社纽约讯：据报载：美国前副总统华莱士在好莱坞二万七千听众前发表演说，再度痛斥杜鲁门主义。华莱士诘难“杜鲁门虚伪的断言”，即所谓“世界人民向美国乞求坦克同枪炮去抵抗集权主义的侵略者”。他说：杜鲁门主义的自持与其说是世界的福利，勿宁说是世界的重整军备，并且是无限制的去支持各个反苏维埃的政府。华莱士宣称世界人民需要为和平的组织。并谓：在联合国之下的和平的意思就是：“在联合国之下的世界经济重建，由联合国强行管制原子能，在联合国之下解除军备并使战略地位国际化，以及所有国家都全心全力支持联合国组织。”
