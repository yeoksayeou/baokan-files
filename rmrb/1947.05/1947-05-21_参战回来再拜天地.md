　　"Come Back from the War and Then Bow to Heaven and Earth"
　　Su Zhong
　　On March 8th, Wutai Village in Yanggu held a meeting to support the front lines and defend Chairman Mao. At the meeting, a young member of the farmers' association, Li Yandong, was eager to sign up to carry a stretcher. Usually, he was always the first to volunteer for anything in the farmers' association.
　　March 12th was his wedding day. The bridal sedan chair arrived at the door with music playing, and the whole family was busy. Just then, Xiao Shuan, the notorious hothead of the village, ran over to tell him, "Aren't you going yet! The stretcher team is gathering to leave..."
　　Hearing this, he couldn't wait to finish the wedding ceremony. He grabbed his dry food and luggage and left. The village chief tried to dissuade him, saying, "We've already found someone to replace you. Go next time, don't delay your happy event." He replied as he walked, "Supporting the front lines and defending Chairman Mao is a major event. What is getting married? It won't be too late for me to come back from completing my mission and then bow to Heaven and Earth..."
　　His mother was anxious when she couldn't dissuade him, and grabbed him, saying, "It's such a rare and good day, the bride is already at the door..."
　　"Mother," he interrupted her, "How did we get to live such good lives? We were able to get land after liberation, that's how we can afford to marry a wife now. We can't forget Chairman Mao! Have you forgotten that?" His mother didn't say a word and sent him off.

　　“参战回来再拜天地”
    苏众
    三月八日，阳谷五台村开了个支援前线保卫毛主席大会，会上年青的农会会员李颜东争先报名抬担架，平日在农会他啥事都抢在人头里。
    十二日这天，是他娶媳妇的好日子，花轿吹吹打打的抬到门口了，全家正忙的时候，村里有名的冒失鬼小拴跑来告他：“你还不去！担架队集合要走了……”
    他听了这话，顾不上拜完天地，拿起干粮行李就走，村长劝阻他说：“已经找到代替你的人了。下次去吧，不要耽误了你的喜事。”他一边走一边回答：“支援前线，保卫毛主席是大事，娶媳妇算啥，我完成任务回来再拜天地也不晚……”。
    他娘见劝阻不住急了，一把拉住他说：“难得这样的好日子，新人都抬到门口了……”。
    “娘”他打断了娘的话：“咱们的日子过得好了，怎么来的，如今翻身得了地。才能娶来媳妇。这可不能忘了毛主席，这话你忘了！”他娘一声不吭把他送走了。
