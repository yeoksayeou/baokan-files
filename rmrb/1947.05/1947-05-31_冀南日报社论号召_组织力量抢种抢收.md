Jinnan Daily Editorial Calls for Organizing Efforts to Rush Planting and Harvesting

[This newspaper Jinnan 29th dispatch] Jinnan Daily published an editorial calling on all farmers in the region to organize and carry out a crash program of harvesting and planting, prevent drought and prepare for famine, in order to support the front lines and meet the great counter-offensive. The editorial first emphasized that cadres should be ideologically mobilized, especially the leading organs should be fully ideologically mobilized, to overcome all lax ideas that neglect seedling planting and rush planting, and despise production leadership, and overcome all paralyzing ideas that do not attach importance to drought prevention, conservation, and famine preparedness. They should earnestly and practically concentrate all forces to lead the masses in a crash program of planting, harvesting, drought prevention, and famine preparedness. The editorial pointed out that "wheat ripens in an instant" and "competing for autumn to grab wheat." Due to participation in the war and military service, there is a shortage of labor, and the emancipated farmers have a shortage of agricultural implements, and the task of rush planting has not yet been completed. It is still necessary to shorten the wheat harvesting process, in order to seize the opportunity before and after wheat harvesting to implement rush planting. It is necessary to organize all able-bodied, semi-able-bodied, and animal power. The editorial went on to point out that in the process of organizing, it is absolutely not allowed to force the masses to be compiled or to make excessive demands for large-scale mutual assistance and village-wide labor exchange; but rather to require the masses to adopt all forms based on old habits, and to implement small-scale, temporary, and voluntary combinations of mutual assistance, whether it is joint farming or mutual assistance in rush planting or wheat harvesting, as long as the masses voluntarily combine and help each other, they should be welcomed, encouraged, and promoted. The village can unify leadership, and with the consent of the masses, pay attention to the adjustment of labor and agricultural implements. All levels of organs, troops, organizations, and schools should carry forward the recent spirit of helping and leading the masses in seedling planting and rush planting, stop all unnecessary work, concentrate human and animal power, and fully help and lead the masses in a crash program of harvesting, to ensure that all wheat is harvested on time. During the harvesting period, special attention must be paid to saving civilian labor. After the wheat harvest, the masses should be educated to practice strict economy! Oppose eating and drinking lavishly. At the same time, seize the time to carry out a crash program of planting late seedlings. Finally, it was emphasized that 90% of the effort should be put into timely leadership and organization of the masses to rush planting and harvesting, and implement unified leadership, with the same high degree of enthusiasm and responsibility as leading the masses to turn over, to lead the masses in rush planting and harvesting, as the first step in carrying out large-scale production.

[This newspaper Jinnan 29th dispatch] Each village in Xuguzhai community, Er District, Weixian County, is brewing to organize mutual aid to rush the wheat harvest. Xixu Village has more than ten qing of wheat, and in the brewing process, everyone unanimously agreed to mobilize men, women, old and young to rush the wheat harvest. The Women's Association proposed to ensure the active participation of women. The masses in Xuguzhai discussed mutual aid in wheat harvesting on the evening of the 23rd, and all unanimously stated that they would ensure that the wheat of military dependents and stretcher bearers would be harvested in a timely manner. All full and semi-able-bodied laborers in the village are now being organized.

　　冀南日报社论号召
  　组织力量抢种抢收
    【本报冀南二十九日电】冀南日报发表社论，号召全区农民组织起来，突击抢收抢种，防旱备荒，以支援前线，迎接大反攻。社论首先强调干部从思想上动员起来，特别是领导机关从思想上充分的动员起来，克服一切忽视点苗抢种、轻视生产领导的松懈思想，克服一切对防旱节约备荒毫不重视的麻痹思想，而认真的切实的集中一切力量，领导群众突击抢种抢收防旱备荒。社论指出“麦熟一晌”、“争秋抢麦”。因参战参军，劳力缺乏，翻身农民农具短少，抢种任务尚未完成，尚须缩短麦收过程，以便麦前后抓紧时机贯彻抢种，必须把一切全劳力、半劳力、畜力组织起来。继指出在组织起来之中，绝不能强迫把群众编制起来或过高的要求大互助全村大变工；而是要求群众根据旧有习惯采用的一切形式，实行小型的临时性的自愿结合的互助，无论伙犋也好，无论是只互助抢种、互助麦收也好，只要群众自愿结合，互相帮助，就要欢迎、鼓励、提倡。村则可统一领导，在商得群众同意的情形下，注意劳力农具的调剂。各级机关、部队、团体及学校要发扬最近帮助与带领群众点苗抢种的精神，停止一切不必要工作，集中人畜力，全部帮助与带领群众突击抢收，保证全部麦子按时收割完毕。在抢收期中，须特别注意节省民力。麦收之后则教育群众厉行节约！反对大吃二喝。同时抓紧突击抢种晚苗。最后强调指出要拿出百分之九十的力量来及时领导组织群众抢种抢收，实行一元化领导，以全力领导群众翻身同样高度的热情与责任心，来领导群众抢种抢收，作为进行大生产的第一步。
    【本报冀南二十九日电】威县二区徐固寨小区各村正酝酿组织互助突击麦收，西徐村有麦十顷以上，在酝酿中一致同意男女老少总动员，突击麦收，妇会提出保证妇女积极参加。徐固寨群众于二十三日晚讨论互助收麦，都一致表示保证把军工属及出担架者的麦子及时收割，村中所有全半劳动力现正进行组织中。
