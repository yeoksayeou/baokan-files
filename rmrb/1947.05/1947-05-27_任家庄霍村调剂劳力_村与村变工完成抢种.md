　　Renjiazhuang and Huocun Coordinate Labor
  　Village-to-Village Labor Exchange Completes Emergency Planting
    [Reported by this newspaper] Renjiazhuang Village in the Fourth District of Changzhi still had 250 mu of land unplanted. The weather was windy but without rain, and the entire village had only four head of livestock and forty-eight laborers. After doing the calculations, it would take four or five days to complete the digging and planting. Everyone was worried. Huocun had already finished planting, and had ten head of livestock at home preparing to deliver fertilizer, but had not yet left. In order to rush the planting, the district specially organized a large-scale labor exchange between the front and rear villages. Huocun allocated five head of livestock and ten people to Renjiazhuang Village, and they planted 250 mu in two days. The organizational method for the labor exchange was as follows: (1) The total labor account is calculated between villages, each recording its own labor hours. The village production committee calculates with the households, and the village unifies the large-scale labor exchange. Villagers who owe labor pay with grain, according to the total score of war-effort labor in the entire village. (2) Renjiazhuang Village repays the labor owed to Huocun by exchanging labor for war-effort support and corvée during transportation. In this way, the masses said, "No one suffers a loss. As long as the seeds are planted, we will see seedlings and reap a harvest. Without a large-scale labor exchange, it wouldn't be this fast." (Changzhi Emergency Planting Small Newspaper)

　　任家庄霍村调剂劳力
  　村与村变工完成抢种
    【本报讯】长治四区任家庄村还有二百五十亩地没种上，天只刮风不下雨、全村只有四犋牲口，四十八个劳力，算了一下账，连掘代种需四、五天才能种完，人人都发了愁。霍村早已下种完了，有十犋牲口在家准备送脚还没有走，为了抢种，该区特组织村与村前后方大变工；霍村给任家庄村拨去五犋牲口十个人，两天下种二百五十亩。变工的组织办法：（一）村与村算总工账，各记各工数，各村生产委员会与花户算，由村统一大变工，群众欠下工谁欠谁出米，按全村战勤劳力总分数得米。（二）任家庄欠下霍村的工，出战勤支差义运时给霍村换工，这样，群众说：“谁也不吃亏，只要下了种，见苗收三分，不是大变工，那有这样快。”（长治突击下种小报）
