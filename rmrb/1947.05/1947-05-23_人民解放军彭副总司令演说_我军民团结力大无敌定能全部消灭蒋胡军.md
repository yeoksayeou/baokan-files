Following General Zhou Enlai on the stage was General Peng Dehuai. As soon as he appeared, the slogan "Advance to victory under the genius command of Deputy Commander Peng" immediately reverberated through the valley. This ever-victorious general of the people, on behalf of Chairman Mao Zedong and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, congratulated everyone and delivered a magnificent speech: "The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region had ten years of peace, but was invaded by Chiang Kai-shek's running dog, Hu Zongnan. The border region's army and people resolutely defended themselves, and from March 19th to April 4th, annihilated an enemy brigade on average every half month. There are still 28 brigades of Chiang-Hu troops invading the border region. If calculated at the previous rate, they will all be wiped out in another fourteen months. As long as we do not make mistakes, are not arrogant, and work hard together, this is possible." At this time, the entire audience raised their arms and shouted in unison: "We have the strength! We can definitely do it!" Deputy Commander Peng then listed the conditions for victory: "We have a vast and favorable maneuvering ground; we have the support of 1.6 million people, who block news, scout out the enemy's situation, supply food, join the main force, and participate in stretcher transport; we have the hard work of all commanders and fighters who are loyal to the people's liberation cause, and everyone can stand at their posts, contribute everything, and complete the task." Deputy Commander Peng emphasized: "Being able to unite with the people is to be invincible." He called on all commanders and fighters to never be separated from the people.

Comrade Xi Zhongxun, Political Commissar of the Northwest People's Liberation Army, in his speech, condemned the crimes of the Chiang-Hu troops to the world: "The people of the border region have suffered unprecedented disasters this time. Houses have been destroyed, food has been looted, livestock has been slaughtered, young men have been captured, and women have been raped, destroying the happy life that the people of the border region have painstakingly built over ten years. However, the people of the border region will never yield. They must take revenge!" Political Commissar Xi called on all young people in the border region to take up weapons and join the guerrillas and the regular army. Men and women, young and old, should all engage in production, actively participate in stretcher transport and rear service, and support the front line with all their strength.

Labor hero Wu Manyou shouted loudly: "Hu Zongnan has taken the wrong path. Don't let him escape, annihilate him completely! The people of the entire border region should join the army! I, Old Wu, will officially join the regular army tomorrow. Those who stay at home must work hard to produce, participate in stretcher transport, and support the front line. Don't miss this good time!" Immediately, the whole audience was excited, and many young farmers asked to join the army. Labor hero Liu Yuhou is currently leading a stretcher team to serve the front line. He vowed: "We will go home after defeating Hu Zongnan!" Dozens of stretcher teams in the audience successively took oaths represented by their captains: Not a single wounded soldier will be left on the battlefield. Next were speeches by combat heroes and liberated soldiers. Wang Youfu, a combat hero of a certain unit, was wounded in the eye and lost contact during the Xinchuan River battle. He did not eat for three days and nights, and finally carried his machine gun back to his unit after overcoming various difficulties. He and several other heroes were warmly cheered by all commanders and fighters. Li Guoyu, a squad leader and combat hero of a certain unit, is a model in combat, work, study, and production. During the Hengshan battle, he captured ten enemies and seized seven guns alone. When resisting the enemy in Jinpenwan, he bravely captured a vital hilltop, reducing casualties in his company and ensuring the safety of neighboring units; he also captured two machine guns and two enemies. Wang Zhenhuai, a machine gun platoon leader of a certain unit, has been selected as a hero in every defense battle. His most significant characteristic in work, life, and relationships with superiors and subordinates is a spirit of unity. Wang Laohu, a heroic soldier of a certain unit, was the first to attack Panlong's East and West Dabasa this time. He threw more than seventy grenades and quickly circled around to the side of the fortifications, killing three enemies with three shots and seizing three rifles. Their heroic deeds were warmly cheered by the whole audience. Li Zhaojing, a combat hero of a certain unit, was liberated from Fu Zuoyi's troops the year before last. He said excitedly: "I suffered a lot in the past, but I didn't know this was my home until I came here." Cai Fangming, a soldier who was liberated from Yan Xishan's army last September, said proudly: "Becoming a soldier of the People's Liberation Army is the noblest thing. I will serve the people to the end!" Wu Shouren, a soldier who was liberated in Qinghuabian on March 25th, said: "I saw that the Eighth Route Army is truly for the people. Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan must be eliminated." Many newly liberated soldiers voluntarily came to the stage to speak, all expressing their determination to fight to the end.

　　人民解放军彭副总司令演说
    我军民团结力大无敌定能全部消灭蒋胡军
    继周恩来将军出现在讲台上的是彭德怀将军，他刚一出现，“在彭副总司令天才指挥下向胜利前进”的口号声，立刻震荡山谷，这一位人民常胜将军，代表毛泽东主席和朱德总司令向大家祝贺，并发表雄壮的演说：“陕甘宁边区和平了十年，被蒋介石的走狗胡宗南打进来了。边区军民坚决自卫，自三月十九日到四月四日，平均每半个月消灭敌人一个旅。现在侵入边区之蒋胡军尚有廿八个旅，如以过去的速率推算，再有十四个月就将其全部消灭。只要我们不犯错误，不骄傲，共同努力不懈，这是可能的。”这时全场一致振臂高呼：“我们有力量！一定能做到！”彭副总司令继即列举胜利的条件：“我们有广阔的良好的回旋地；有一百六十万人民的拥护，替我们封锁消息、侦察敌情、供给粮食、参加主力、参加担架运输；我们有忠实于人民解放事业的全体将士的艰苦努力，每一个人都能站在自己的岗位上贡献一切，完成任务。”彭副总司令着重指出：“能够和人民团结一致就能无敌于天下。”他号召全体指战员永远不脱离人民。
    西北人民解放军政治委员习仲勋同志讲话中，向全世界控诉了蒋胡军的罪恶：“边区人民此次受到空前灾难，房屋被毁坏，粮食被抢劫，牲畜被杀光，壮丁被抓捕，妇女被奸淫，把边区人民十年辛苦建立的幸福生活破坏了，但是，边区人民绝不屈服。一定要复仇！”习政委号召边区全体青年拿起武器参加游击队、参加正规军，男女老少一齐生产，积极参加担架运输和后方勤务，用一切力量支援前线。
    劳动英雄吴满有大声呼喊：“胡宗南的路走错了，不要让他逃掉，全部消灭他！全边区人民都参军呀！我老五明天就正式参加正规军。留在家里的要努力生产，参加担架运输，支援前线，切不要错过好时光！”立即全场激动，许多青年农民要求参军。劳动英雄刘玉厚现正率领担架队服务前线，他誓言：“打垮胡宗南再回家！”全场数十担架队由队长代表相继宣誓：不让有一个伤员被留在战场上。继为战斗英雄与解放战士讲话。某部战斗英雄王有福在新岔河战斗中，眼睛被打伤失掉联络，三日夜未吃饭，终于背着机枪经过种种困难回到本队。他和其他几位英雄都受到全体指战员的热烈欢呼。某部战斗英雄班长李国玉，是战斗、工作、学习和生产的四种模范，横山战斗时曾一人俘敌十名、缴枪七支。金盆湾抗击敌人，奋勇夺下极重要的山头，减少了本连伤亡，保障了友邻安全；并缴机枪两挺，俘敌两名。某部机枪排长王振怀在保卫战中历次被选为英雄，他在工作上、生活上、对上下级的关系上最显著的标志就是团结作风。某部英雄战士王老虎此次最先攻上蟠龙东西大巴色，他共打了七十多个手榴弹，又迅速的绕到工事侧面，三枪打死三个敌人，缴到三支步枪。他们的英雄业迹，受到全场的热烈欢呼。某部战斗英雄李兆京，是前年从傅作义部中被解放过来的，他激动的说：“我过去受了很多罪，到这里才知道这才是我的家。”去年九月从阎锡山军中被解放过来的战士蔡放明骄傲的说：“成为人民解放军的战士是最高尚了，我要为人民服务到底！”三月二十五日在青化砭被解放过来的战士武寿人说：“我看到八路军是真正为人民的，蒋介石胡宗南一定要被消灭。”许多新解放战士纷纷自动上台讲话，都一致表示战斗到底的决心。
