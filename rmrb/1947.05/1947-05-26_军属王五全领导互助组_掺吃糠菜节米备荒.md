　　Military Dependent Wang Wuquan Leads Mutual Aid Group
  　Mixing Bran and Vegetables, Saving Rice for Famine Preparation
    [This Dispatch from Taiyue, 24th] The mutual aid groups in Shimin Zhangshan Village were not consolidated; as soon as the young and strong men went to join the war, the lack of labor caused them to collapse. Model military dependent Wang Wuquan, fearing that the land of the conscripted laborers would be deserted, consulted with everyone and reorganized the mutual aid group. He also offered his own livestock to cultivate the land for the families of martyrs, which moved others, who said, "Wuquan is a military dependent, yet he treats others favorably by helping them cultivate land; how can we not move?" So they reorganized, cultivating twenty-two mu of land for the conscripted laborers in one afternoon, and completing the cultivation of 85 percent of the village's land in three days. Now, under Wang Wuquan's leadership, the village is carrying out drought prevention and famine preparation. All fifty-two members of the mutual aid group are mixing bran and vegetables in their daily meals, saving one "he" of rice per person per day, which will save one "shi" and five "dou" and six "sheng" of rice per month.

　　军属王五全领导互助组
  　掺吃糠菜节米备荒
    【本报太岳二十四日电】士敏张山村互助组不巩固，青壮年一去参战，劳力缺乏就垮了。模范军属王五全怕荒了参战民夫的地，便和大家商量，重新组织互助组，又把自己的牲口拉给烈属耕种，感动了别人，都说：“五全是军属，还优待别人种地，咱们还能不动弹”。便又组织起来，一个下午给参战民夫种了二十二亩地，三天把全村百分之八十五的地都种完。现在该村又在王五全的领导下，进行防旱备荒。全互助组五十二人，每日每人掺吃糠菜，节约一合米，一月即可节约米一石五斗六升。
