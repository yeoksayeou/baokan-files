　　Xiayashui Village's First Labor Exchange
    Mutual Aid for Ten Days Saves Over Two Hundred Workdays
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 3rd] Xiayashui Village in Yangcheng organized for production, saving two hundred and seventy-seven workdays in ten days. The village has thirty-five households, surrounded by barren mountains. Each person has an average of 1.4 mu of sloping land. The grain harvested each year is only enough to eat for three months, making it the poorest village in the county. Although the government has repeatedly called for organization in recent years, it has not yet been organized. The masses work and transport goods outside the village all year round to maintain their livelihoods. Last winter, Dongshan Administrative Village, with the support of the cooperative union, opened a ploughshare furnace. Some villagers went down the mountain to burn charcoal, and only returned to the mountain around Qingming Festival this spring. Everyone was worried about not being able to go to the fields. If they built embankments, they would miss out on carrying manure; if they carried manure, they would miss out on sowing seeds. At this critical moment, the county government held a production mobilization meeting. The village cadres returned from the meeting, absorbed the experience of other villages organizing themselves, and discussed it in the winter school. Everyone agreed to organize, and all but two households voluntarily formed seven groups. There were fifty-three full and semi-laborers, both men and women. They began working on April 8th. Semi-laborers dug and picked up stones, while full laborers built embankments and delivered manure. Two days later, they began plowing and sowing. Semi-laborers pulled livestock and spread manure, while full laborers guided the plough. They plowed one mu and sowed one mu. On the 18th, each group gathered to calculate accounts. They built a total of 259 zhang of embankments, using 188 workdays, saving 205.5 workdays compared to the past. They delivered 3,025 loads of manure, saving 51 workdays. They sowed 47 mu of grain land, saving one workday on average for every three workdays, for a total of 17 workdays saved. The ten days of mutual aid by the seven groups saved a total of 277 workdays. Currently, labor efficiency is gradually improving. The spring plowing campaign is nearing completion, and some laborers have been extracted to carry out transportation.

　　下押水村头一次变工
    互助十天省工二百余
    【本报太岳三日电】阳城下押水村组织起来生产，十天省工二百七十七个。该村卅五户，村周一片荒山，每人平均一亩四分坡地，每年所打粮食仅能吃三个月，为全县最穷的村。几年来虽经政府一再号召，但迄未组织起来。群众全年在外面打忙工、运输维持生活。去冬东山行政村在合作区联社扶植下，开设一座犁面炉。该庄群众一部下山烧炭，直至今春清明才上山，大家都愁得无法下地。要垒＠就误了担粪，要担粪就误了下种，正在此时，县政府召开生产动员大会。该村干部开会回来，吸收了别村组织起来的经验，在冬学里进行酝酿，大家都同意组织起来，除两户外，都自愿结合成七个小组。男女全半劳力五十三个，从四月八日开始劳动，半劳力挖拾石头，全劳力垒＠送粪。两天后即开始犁地下种，半劳力拉牲口、扬粪，全劳力掌犁。犁一亩下种一亩，十八日各组集会算账，共垒＠二百五十九丈，用工一百八十八个，较过去省工二百零半个。送粪三千零二十五担，省工五十一个。谷地下种四十七亩，平均三工省一工，共省工十七个。七个组十天的互助，共省工二百七十七个。目前劳动效率仍在逐渐提高，突击春耕接近完成，已抽出一部劳力进行运输。
