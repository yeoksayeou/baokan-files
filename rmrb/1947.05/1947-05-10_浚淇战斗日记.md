　　Junqi Battle Diary
    Zhang Bisheng
    April 17th, Sunny, camped in ×× village
    In the afternoon, our regiment was ordered to advance towards the earth ridge in the southeast. Enemy planes circled in the sky from time to time, and steel and mountain artillery shells exploded continuously in the air. However, it couldn't stop our army's advance at all. Twenty minutes later, the front troops engaged the enemy. After an extremely fierce battle, the gunfire returned to silence, indicating the battle was over. When I arrived at the front line with the paramedics, groups of raggedly dressed prisoners walked from the front, looking very embarrassed. Where had their usual prestige gone?! Two ordnance men accepted the weapons and ammunition handed over by each battalion with a smile. Their fountain pens scribbled busily in their notebooks: Today's battle captured one 60mm mortar, two small cannons, fifteen rifle grenade launchers, twenty-one machine guns, bullets and grenades... Everywhere was the clamor of the soldiers. Some were recounting their battle experiences, and some were playing with sophisticated American-made weapons, because it was the first time our local corps had captured American weapons! A soldier said loudly in the crowd, "I finally understand what Chiang Kai-shek's good troops are like. What Second Rapid Column? So that's it!" "The soldiers don't want to fight, what can Chiang Kai-shek do!" another interjected. At this time, people were all immersed in the joy of victory, and had long thrown the fatigue of last night's eighty-li march to the back of their minds!
  April 18th, Sunny, camped in ×× town
    The sun was shining on our backsides, and we were still tightly gripped by the fatigue after the excitement and joy. Someone ran over and said, "The Third Battalion got a tank." Like getting an injection of stimulant, we immediately ran three li away to see it. This was an American-made medium tank, equipped with a steel cannon and two machine guns. The body was seven or eight feet high, and the steel armor was painted grass green, looking like a house made of steel. There were four drivers in this tank. Yesterday, they were disrupted by our army. They drove the tank around in the fields all night, finally finding their original departure point. But they didn't expect their rapid column to run too fast. When they realized they were surrounded, our infantry rifles opened fire simultaneously, and anti-tank shells pierced the thick deck, leaving a hole in this steel house. The tank crew fled in panic, but were finally left as guests by the warriors of our Ninth Squad.
    On this day, our regiment chased to Jiangying Village, eighteen li north of Daokou. Along the way, our brother troops went back and forth transporting prisoners and weapons to the rear. We learned from the telephone that our army had annihilated the entire 49th Brigade and part of the 66th Division, and the brigade commander had also been captured alive. Just as the troops were gathering, the hateful red-headed planes appeared in the sky like mourners. So the American weapons just captured by the soldiers got a chance to be tested. Bang! Crack! Bang! Crack! The wailing enemy plane was shot so that it dodged here and there. People were encouraged by this tense scene and couldn't help shouting: Shoot! Shoot! Under our fierce shooting, the enemy plane finally fled in a panic.

　　浚淇战斗日记
    张碧生
    四月十七日  晴宿营××村
    午后，我团奉命向东南土岭进发。敌机不时在上空盘旋，钢炮弹及山炮弹亦不断在空中爆裂。但，丝毫阻止不住我军的前进。二十分钟后，前面部队和敌人接上了火，经过一场极其激烈的战斗，枪声复归沉寂，盖战斗已告结束。当我随同救护人员到达前线，一群群穿着破烂衣服的俘虏从前面走来，神情十分狼狈，他们平日的威风不知到那里去了？！两个军械员笑眯眯的接受着各营交来的武器弹药，他的自来水笔，匆忙的往本子上划着：今日战斗缴获六○炮一门，小炮二门，枪榴弹筒十五个，机枪二十一挺，子弹榴弹……到处是战士们的喧嚷声，有的在叙述他战斗的经过，有的在玩弄精制的美造武器，因为我们这个地方兵团缴获美式武器还是第一次呵！一个战士在人群中大声说：“我总算认识了蒋介石的好队伍，什么第二快速纵队，原来如此！”“当兵的都不愿打，蒋介石有什么办法！”另一个插了一句。此时，人们全为胜利的快乐所浸透，把昨晚八十里行军的疲劳，早已抛向九霄云外去了！
  四月十八日  晴  宿营××镇
    太阳晒上屁股了，我们还为兴奋欢乐后的疲劳紧紧的抓住，不知是谁跑来说：“三营得了一辆坦克。”就像打了针兴奋剂，一下就跑到三里外去看。这是一辆美造中型坦克，内装有一门钢炮，两挺机枪，车身有七八尺高，钢甲涂成草绿色，看来活像座钢做成的房子。这辆坦克上有四个驾驶员，在昨天被我军冲乱了，他们驾着坦克在野地里转了一夜，好容易找到原来的出发地，但没想到他们的快速纵队确乎跑得太快了，当他们发现已陷于重围时，我方的机步枪一齐开了火，反坦克炮弹穿过了厚厚的甲板，给这座钢房子上留了一个窟窿，坦克手仓惶下车欲逃，但终于被我九小队的勇士留下作客了。
    是日我团追到道口以北十八里之姜应村，沿途我兄弟部队往后方送俘虏武器的往来不绝，于电话中得知此时我军已歼灭四十九旅的全部，及六十六师的一部，旅长亦被生擒。正值队伍集中，可恶的红头飞机，像吊孝似的出现在上空，于是战士刚缴获来的美式武器，得到了试放的机会，砰拍！砰拍！把这架哀嚎的敌机打得东躲西藏，人们为这一紧张的场面所鼓舞，不禁大喊：打！打！敌机终于在我激烈的射击下狼狈的逃窜了。
