　　Boldly Organize Mutual Aid Production
    Adhere to the Principle of Voluntary Combination
    Heshun Initially Gained Experience in Leading Production
    [This Dispatch from Heshun] After the Heshun County Production Mobilization Conference, a movement to organize was universally launched in various villages, and the masses showed great enthusiasm for production. However, many problems were also discovered. Some groups, once organized with many people, soon collapsed. After examining the reasons, the following experiences can be gained:

  Two Approaches, Two Results
    1.  Boldly mobilize the masses' enthusiasm for production, and organize based on voluntary combination. In areas adopting this approach, it is inevitable at the beginning to have a phenomenon of "soldiers facing soldiers, generals facing generals, firewood matching willow branches." Some past "barefoot" lazy people will be isolated, and some semi-laborers will be rejected. But we don't need to be afraid. This situation can be gradually resolved, because this can quickly bring forth good groups to become banners. For example, Dongguan adopted this method. In the voluntary combination and organization movement, Yu Shuangnian organized first, and set out a "cultivate one, surplus one" plan. After calculating the benefits of mutual aid, it immediately promoted the entire village. Yin Yang Huo Guigui and Suona horn player Ren Huanni voluntarily organized and challenged Yu Shuangnian, forming a voluntary bumping partner organization movement from small to large throughout the village. Out of 190 households in the village, 179 households are now organized. Another example is Wang Erdan, a cadre in Beiguan, who initially wanted to organize all full and semi-able-bodied laborers in the village, considering more to be better. He organized twelve groups at once. Because he did not adopt the method of boldly mobilizing and voluntary combination, nine groups collapsed in a few days. The members had no prior mutual aid experience, and did not know how to exchange equivalent value; therefore, it was difficult to consolidate. When the organization movement is launched, the leadership should help them solve the problem of labor compensation, so that mutual aid can expand day by day. For example, in Zhao Yuanbao's group in Yuanjie, it was originally a strong-against-strong situation, and everyone was unwilling to take in semi-laborers. But later, after understanding the principle of equivalent exchange, they realized that many odd jobs also required semi-laborers, so they organized the crippled Erhuzi into the group, and the number of people organized became larger and larger.
    2.  Equivalent exchange is very difficult in new areas. The masses have no experience, cannot score accurately, and even if a evaluation committee is selected, they cannot evaluate well. Letting the group leader evaluate puts the group leader in a sweat and cannot determine who should get more and who should get less. Therefore, everyone is unwilling to be the group leader, making mutual aid unenthusiastic. After everyone's discussion, scoring is based on the work, based on the usual labor efficiency as the principle, with extra points for exceeding and deductions for not meeting the standard. This way, scoring based on work ensures that no one suffers losses, and everyone says it is very good. Goubu Chi said: "Last year, I wanted to be active, but because it was always ten points, I shouldn't be active even if I wanted to. Carrying four loads of manure is ten points, carrying twelve loads is also ten points, so I just go to sleep after I've carried enough." Yuan Gui said: "With mutual aid and equivalent exchange, everyone's enthusiasm for production has increased. The way to get rich was originally here."
    3.  Without resolving legacy problems, mutual aid is not easy to get enthusiastic. For example, in Baiquan, the elimination of feudalism was not thorough, the middle peasants were struggled against in Fuziling, the middle peasants sold five donkeys, and the relationship between cadres and the masses in the imperial examination was not good, and the masses did not dare to speak. ……These villages became active in production mutual aid only after these problems were resolved.

　　放手组织互助生产
    坚持自愿结合原则
    和顺初步取得领导生产经验
    【本报和顺讯】和顺全县生产动员大会后，各村普遍开展了组织起来的运动，群众生产劲头很大；但同时也发现了很多问题，有的小组，一组织起来人很多但不久就垮台了，检查原因，可获得以下经验：
  两种作法  两种结果
    一、放手发动群众生产热情，自愿结合进行组织，采取这种作法的地区开始难免有“兵对兵、将对将、柴木对柳棒”的现象，有些过去的“光头”懒汉被孤立起来，有些半劳力会被摒弃，但我们不必害怕，这种情况可以慢慢解决，因为这样能很快涌现出好的小组，成为旗帜，如东关就是采取这种方法，在自愿结合的组织起来运动中，于双年先组织起来，订出了耕一余一计划，经过互助算了得利账后，马上推动了全村，阴阳霍喜贵、吹鼓手任焕妮、自愿组织并与于双年挑战，形成了全村由小到大的自愿碰伙的组织起来的运动。全村一百九十户，现组织起一百七十九户了。又如北关干部王二旦，一开始就想把全村全半强弱劳力都组织起来，以多为荣，一下组织十二组，由于未采取放手发动与自愿结合的方法，不几天垮了九个组，组内过去没有互助经验，又不知道怎样等价交换；因此便不好巩固。当组织起来运动开展后，领导上要帮助他们解决劳力等偿问题，这样互助就能一天天扩大起来；如元街赵元保组里，原来是强对强，大家不愿要半劳力，但后来懂得了等价交换的道理后，认识到零活很多也需要半劳力，便把拐子二虎子组织进去，组织起来的数量便越来越大了。
    二、等价交换在新区困难很多，群众无经验，不会评分，选了评委会也评不好，让小组长评，把组长逼的一头汗，也评不出谁该多谁该少，因此都不愿当组长，弄的互助不起劲，经大家讨论后，按活评分，以平时的劳动效率为原则，超过加分，不够减分。这样按活评互不吃亏，都说很好。狗不吃说：“去年咱到想积极，可因老是十分，应该积极也不积极了，担四回粪十分，我担十二回也是十分，因之我送够就睡觉了。”元贵说：“互助起来，等价交换，大家的生产劲头大了，能发财的门道原来就在这里。”
    三、不解决遗留问题，互助也不容易起劲。如白泉扫封建不彻底，夫子岭斗了中农，中农卖驴五头，科举干群关系不好，群众不敢说话。…………这类村是在解决了这些问题之后，生产互助才活跃起来。（桂林、拴林）
