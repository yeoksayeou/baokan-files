　　Resolving the Contradiction Between Dike Repair and Production
    Fan County Establishes River Management Committee
    [Report from this newspaper's correspondent in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region, 22nd] On May 6th, the Fan County government convened a joint meeting of district chiefs to study ways to combine dike repair along the river, consolidate rear production, re-investigation, and security work. It was decided that the county and districts would establish River Management Committees and Rear Area Committees, respectively. The county established a River Defense Committee, with departments for welfare, engineering, and supply, and also formed a River Defense Brigade. Districts established welfare, engineering, and supply sections. Every 500 civilian laborers formed a company, with the company commander and instructor being cadres from the district or sub-district. Each company also invited one doctor. The Rear Area Committee was responsible for production, re-investigation, and security work. After the young and strong men in each village participated in dike repair, there was a shortage of labor. Semi-able-bodied laborers could be mobilized to participate in production, young women could go to the fields to work, and older men could be divided into groups to teach. Primary school students in higher grades and primary school students with productive capacity implemented a system of half-day study and half-day helping the masses with production. Old men were responsible for night watch, and children stood guard during the day. Each sub-district could retain a number of militia members. During the day, they dispersed for production, and at night they concentrated in the sub-district for patrols.
