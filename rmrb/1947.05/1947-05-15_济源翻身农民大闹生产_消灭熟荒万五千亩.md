　　【This newspaper, Taiyue, 13th dispatch】 The Jiyuan peasants, who suffered long-term devastation from enemy puppets and famine, have now plunged into a production movement after the earth-shattering struggle for land distribution. Since the beginning of spring, with the support of government loans of 4.5 million yuan, two-thirds of the more than ten large canals in the county, which had long been silted up, have been dredged, turning more than 20,000 mu of dry land into paddy fields, and sparing more than 10,000 mu of paddy fields from drought. The 15,000 mu of abandoned cultivated land, overgrown with grass, has also been eliminated. Last winter, the Northern Henan Trading Company loaned cotton to 60,000 women weavers, enabling them to earn more than one million yuan in textile profits, which was used to purchase a large number of livestock, partially solving the problem of insufficient animal power. Now, all the peasants in the county have been organized, especially more than 80 percent of the women are working in the fields day and night, so the dispatch of over a thousand civilians to the front line on the 2nd of this month has had no impact on production.
    【This newspaper, Lingchuan dispatch】 After the peasants of Taipei Village overturned their lives, their enthusiasm for production soared, and they actively eliminated abandoned cultivated land. After the 27th Army of the Kuomintang plundered the village, causing famine, people died and were displaced, and more than two qing of land was abandoned, with only more than six qing of land cultivated. This year, with the increased enthusiasm for production, more than one hundred mu of wasteland has been eliminated. In the practical actions of combining participation in the war with spring plowing, the organization of mutual aid teams has been greatly strengthened. The villagers happily said, "From now on, our village will only be rich and will never be poor again."

　　济源翻身农民大闹生产
    消灭熟荒万五千亩
    【本报太岳十三日电】曾遭敌伪灾荒长期摧残的济源农民，经过翻天覆地的分田斗争后，现已卷入生产运动。入春以来，在政府贷款四百五十万元的扶植下，全县久为泥沙塞积的十余条大渠已疏浚三分之二，使二万余亩旱地变为水田，一万余亩水田免于涝魃。草长没胫的一万五千亩熟荒也已消灭。去冬豫北贸易公司曾贷花给六万纺妇，使她的纺织获利百余万元，得以购进大量牲口，部分解决了畜力不足困难。现在全县农民都已组织起来，尤其是百分之八十以上妇女日以继夜下地劳动，因此本月二日千余民夫奔赴前线后，生产毫无影响。
    【本报陵川讯】台北村农民翻身后，生产情绪高涨，积极消灭熟荒。该村经过国民党二十七军搜刮造成灾荒后，人民死亡流离，土地荒芜二顷多，只种有六顷多地，今年生产情绪提高，消灭了荒地一百余亩。在参战春耕结合的实际行动中，互助组的组织大大加强起来，老乡们都高兴的说：“俺村从此只有富，再不会穷了。”
