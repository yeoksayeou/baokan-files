　　Price Drop in Northern Henan New District
    Daokou Town Restores Prosperity
    [This newspaper's Northern Henan Front, 29th dispatch] Yigou, an important town between Tangyin and Qi County on the Pinghan Railway, officially established a town government on the 25th. In the past five days, it has actively carried out pacification and relief work, receiving Chiang Kai-shek's puppet materials and distributing them to local residents, and selling salt at low prices to solve the material difficulties of the local people. During the Chiang Kai-shek puppet rule, the price of salt rose to 4,000 Chiang Kai-shek dollars per catty. After the establishment of the democratic government, only 250 Jichaos were needed to buy one catty of salt. According to the local exchange rate of one Jichao to ten Chiang Kai-shek dollars, the price has been reduced to 37% of the Chiang Kai-shek puppet era.
    [This newspaper's Hebei-Shandong-Henan Front, 29th dispatch] Frontline reporter Wu Xiang reports: Daokou Town has begun to restore its prosperity after being recovered by the People's Liberation Army. Daokou Town is located on the Wei River and is the starting point of the original Daokou-Qinghua Railway, connecting Xinxiang and Jiaozuo to the west, and reaching Linqing and Tianjin by water to the north. The town's goods are mainly sold to the vast rural areas of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan in the east. The town was increasingly declining after eight years of exploitation by the Japanese invaders. In the summer of 1945, the Eighth Route Army liberated the town, and the democratic government strongly supported commerce. Many farmers came here to purchase goods, and the number of merchants and peddlers increased daily, with the population increasing to more than 30,000. In September, Chiang Kai-shek's army invaded the town, and under the pretext of preventing "communist bandits" activities, strictly prohibited farmers from the east from entering the town. A large number of American goods flooded the market with the invasion of Chiang Kai-shek's army. Nearly 300 handicraft cigarette factories and vendors in the town said: "We can buy goods, but we can't sell them. What's the point of doing business?" After the town was liberated, the whole town rejoiced. The shops immediately opened their doors for business, and farmers from the surrounding villages flocked to the town to buy goods. The crossroads were once again crowded with people. Children happily sang the song "Chairman Mao is like a bright lamp on a high mountain" on the street. They learned this beloved song from the Eighth Route Army soldiers and sang it for half a year. Now it is time for them to sing freely again.

　　豫北新区物价下降
    道口镇恢复繁荣
    【本报豫北前线廿九日电】平汉路汤阴淇县间重镇宜沟已于二十五日正式成立镇公所，五日来积极进行安抚救济工作，接收蒋伪物资分配当地居民，并以低价抛卖食盐，解决当地人民物资困难。蒋伪统治时代，食盐价格涨至蒋币四千元一斤，民主政府建立后，冀钞二百五十元即可买食盐一斤。按当地冀钞与蒋币一比十计算，则物价较蒋伪时代减低至百分之三十七。
    【本报冀鲁豫前线二十九日电】前线记者吴象报导：道口镇为人民解放军收复后，开始恢复繁荣，道口镇滨卫河、为原道清路起点，西通新乡、焦作，北由水路可达临清及天津。该镇货物主要销售于东面冀鲁豫之广大农村。该镇经日寇八年压榨，日趋萧条，四五年夏八路军解放该镇，民主政府大力扶助商业，广大农民纷纷来此购货，商号摊贩日见增加，人口增至三万余。九月蒋军侵占该镇，以防止“奸匪”活动为借口，严禁东边农民入镇，大批美货随蒋军侵入市场，该镇近三百家手工业卷烟厂和摊贩商人都说：“买得进来卖不出去，这生意还做什么？”该镇光复后，全镇欢腾若狂，商号立即开门营业，四乡农民纷纷来镇购物，十字街口又开始挤满了人。儿童们高兴地在街上唱着“毛主席好比那高山明灯”的歌。他们从八路军战士那里学会这首心爱的歌子，唱了半年，现在又到他们可以自由歌唱的时候了。
