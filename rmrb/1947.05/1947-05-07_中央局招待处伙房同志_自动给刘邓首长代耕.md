　　Central Bureau Reception Kitchen Comrades
    Automatically Cultivate Land for Leaders Liu and Deng
    [Our Newspaper News] All the comrades in the Central Bureau Reception Kitchen, with the greatest love, amid their heavy work, cultivated land on behalf of Leaders Liu and Deng, completing the production task.
    In their letter to Leaders Liu and Deng, they said: "When the great production movement began in February this year, knowing that everyone had production tasks, and that you were busy fighting at the front day and night, everyone was willing to complete the tasks for you, so they took action. With everyone's concerted efforts, we have successfully completed the task..." In the production through cultivation, Comrade Shen Wanchun, the kitchen sergeant, actively led, and everyone actively participated. In addition to cooking for 200 people every day, they took time to sprout soybeans and sell water (fetching water from the village was a three-mile round trip, and many passing vehicles and horses needed water). Among them, Comrade Ge Yongzhen carried the most water, and his shoulders were swollen. But he said cheerfully: "Fighting at the front is much harder than this." Shen Jinyu was most enthusiastic about sprouting soybeans. After the task was completed, everyone was very excited, the comrades in the kitchen were more united, and at the same time, their work enthusiasm was further improved.

　　中央局招待处伙房同志
    自动给刘邓首长代耕
    【本报讯】中央局招待处伙房全体同志们，以最大热爱，在繁重工作中，给刘、邓首长代耕，完成生产任务。
    在他们给刘、邓首长信中说：“今年二月间大生产运动开始时，知道每人都有生产任务，而您们在前方打仗日夜忙碌，大家都愿替您们完成任务，于是便行动起来了。在大家一致努力下，我们已胜利完成了任务……。”在代耕生产中，伙房上士申万春同志积极领导，全体均积极参加，他们每天除作二百人的饭外，抽时间生豆芽、卖水（驻村吃水来回三里路，过路车马用水很多）。其中葛永振同志担水最多，把膀子都压肿了。但他愉快的说：“前方打仗比这苦得多。”申金玉生豆芽最热心。任务完成后，大家十分兴奋，伙房同志们更加团结，同时也更提高了工作热情。
