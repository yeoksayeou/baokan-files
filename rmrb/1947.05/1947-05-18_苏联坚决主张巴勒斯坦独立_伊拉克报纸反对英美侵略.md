Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: Comprehensive reports indicate that the Political Committee of the United Nations Special Assembly has held continuous meetings from the 8th to the 13th to discuss the composition of the Palestine Investigation Committee and its scope of work. The Soviet Union proposed that the committee should include representatives from the Soviet Union, France, the United States, Britain, and China, and that it should be instructed to consider how to grant Palestine independence immediately. Although the Soviet proposal was supported by many countries, it was not adopted due to the collusion and manipulation of the conference by the United States and Britain, which were unwilling to grant Palestine independence. Soviet representative Andrei Gromyko also suggested to the United Nations Special Assembly on the 14th that a single, independent federal state should be established in Palestine, based on equal rights for Jewish and Arab residents, to protect the legitimate rights of Arabs and Jews; this country should be based on the equal rights and mutual cooperation of the two ethnic groups. Gromyko concluded by stating that the Soviet Union rejected two extremes: one was to establish a Jewish state without considering the interests of the Arabs, and the other was to establish an Arab state without considering the interests of the Jews.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: TASS, Baghdad reports: Iraqi left-wing newspapers have recently exposed Britain's plans in the Middle East and urged the Iraqi people to unite in the struggle for freedom and independence. "Al-Fatan" newspaper stated that the Arabs firmly oppose the "Iraqi-Transjordan Treaty," which facilitates the continued British occupation of Arab countries. The newspaper stated that Britain is seeking help from the United States to counter the national liberation movements in the Middle East, and the evil hands of the United States have already extended to Turkey and Greece. Bevin is creating new plans to form a chain of the Middle East bloc, one of his new plans is the Middle East Defense Committee. The Arabs firmly reject this imperialist plan. No one can convince the Arabs that they need new shackles on their necks.

　　苏联坚决主张巴勒斯坦独立
    伊拉克报纸反对英美侵略
    【新华社陕北十六日电】综合报导：自八日至十三日之联合国特别大会政治委员会连续举行会议，讨论巴勒斯坦调查委员会之组成与其工作范围问题。苏联建议主张该委员会之组成应有苏、法、美、英、中参加，并应训令该委员会考虑如何立即给予巴勒斯坦独立的问题。苏联建议虽为许多国家所支持，但由于美英不愿予巴勒斯坦以独立，相互勾结操纵会议的结果，此项建议卒未获通过。苏联代表葛罗米柯又于十四日向联合国特别大会建议在巴勒斯坦建立以犹太和阿拉伯居民同有平等权力为基础之单一的独立联邦国家，来保护阿拉伯人与犹太人的合法权利；这个国家是以两族平等的权利与相互合作为基础的。葛罗米柯最后表示：苏联拒绝两种极端的解决：一种是要建立一个犹太国家，不考虑阿拉伯人的利益；另一种是要建立一个阿拉伯国家，而不顾及犹太人的利益。
    【新华社陕北十三日电】塔斯社巴格达讯：伊拉克左翼报纸顷揭发英国在中东之计划，并敦促伊拉克人民在为自由独立的斗争中联合起来。“阿尔发坦”报称：阿拉伯人坚决反对“伊拉克、外约但条约”，该条约便利了英国继续占领阿拉伯各国。该报称：英国向美国求助以对抗中东各国的民族解放运动，美国的魔手早已伸到土耳其和希腊。贝文正在制造新的计划以造成中东集团之链环，其新计划之一是中东联防委员会。阿拉伯人坚决拒绝这一帝国主义者的计划。谁也不能使阿拉伯人信服他们脖子上需要新的枷锁。
