Adjusting Fertilizer, Buying and Selling Farm Tools
Yangcheng and Other Places Cooperatives Serve Production
[This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch on the 2nd] Village cooperatives in Yangcheng, Qinshui and other counties are gradually shifting from simple profit-making to organizing mass production and serving agriculture. The Chaizhu Mu Village Cooperative in Yangcheng adjusted 1,108 pieces of sesame cake for military dependents and civilian laborers, with a price reduction of 30 yuan per piece, which can be used on 120 acres of land. It also bought back 100 plows and 12 hoes, all sold to villagers at reduced prices. The cooperative's staff organized a production mutual aid group, with three mules and two donkeys, to plow 56 acres of land for military dependents. In response to the call for thrift and support for the front lines, the system of complete staff and livestock support was implemented, ensuring that public and private interests are taken into account, and that business, production, and participation in the war are combined. The Fuzhe Village Cooperative has specially set up oil presses, small iron furnaces, coal kilns, and other businesses. Under the principle of making what farmers lack, the small iron furnace recently made more than 70 sickles, hoes, etc. for the masses, and repairs old farm tools generally free of charge. Coal is sold at half price, and bean cake and pig manure are sold to the masses at low prices. Personnel engaged in sideline occupations must still take time to participate in agricultural labor. One worker from the small iron furnace takes turns going home every day to engage in agricultural production. The cooperative sends six people every day to participate in the mutual aid group. The Qianggan Village Cooperative and the Manghe Branch lent 6.3 million yuan to the masses to buy livestock, and bought back 14 cattle and donkeys in combination with private capital. The credit department of the District Joint Cooperative also helped buy back 15 head of livestock. A small flour mill opened in Hòugōu, Qìnshuǐ County, lent more than 10,000 yuan to help military families produce last winter. With the promotion and help of the flour mill, 219 households in the whole village raised 20 pigs. It is now decided that the flour mill will shift to serving agriculture as its main focus, combining seasonal sideline production, and making the cooperative a supply department for the people.

　　调剂肥料买卖农具
    阳城等地合作社为生产服务
    【本报太岳二日电】阳城、沁水等县的村合作社，由过去单纯盈利逐渐转变为组织群众生产和为农业服务的方向。阳城柴助木村合作社给军烈属参战民夫调剂麻饼一千一百零八块，每块减价三十元，共可上地百廿亩，又买回一百张犁、十二张锄，都减价卖给村民，社内职员组织一个生产互助组，并带骡三头，驴二头，给军烈属犁地五十六亩，为响应节约和支援前线，实行了职员牲口完全支差的制度，并保证做到公私兼顾，业务生产参战相结合，府泽村合作社特设油坊、小铁炉、煤窑等业务。小铁炉在农民缺甚造甚的方针下，最近给群众打草、锄等七十多张，修理旧农具一般不要钱。煤炭减半价，豆饼、猪粪都低价卖给群众。从事副业的人员，仍要抽时间参加农业劳动。小铁炉工人，每天有一人轮流回家，从事农业生产。合作社每天出六个人参加互助组。枪杆村合作社与蟒河分社，借给群众六十三万元买牲口，结合私人资本共买回牛驴十四头。区联社信用部，也帮助买回十五头牲口。沁水堡头属后沟开的一座小小粉坊，去冬帮助军属生产借款万余元。全庄二一九户在粉坊推动和帮助下，喂了二十口猪。现在决定由粉坊转入以服务农业为主，结合季节副业生产，把合作社成为民众供给部。
