　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd: The Chiang-US reactionaries collude with each other, accelerating the evil activity of turning China into an American colony and suppressing the patriotic movement of the Chinese people, which has been further developed recently due to the US "transferring" surplus warships to Chiang bandits and openly selling Qingdao to the US as a military base. According to the US Information Office: the US government ordered the "transfer" of 271 surplus warships to the Chiang government on the 27th of last month, and dispatched 100 naval officers and 200 soldiers to assist the Chiang family navy, but "the task shall be stipulated by the US Secretary of the Navy." However, a US State Department spokesman openly stated that this "transfer" is part of a long-term aid program to China, stipulating that the "transfer" warships' task is coastal patrol to deal with "pirates." He specified that "according to the current arrangement," the US will establish a "naval mission" in Qingdao. The Washington Star, in commenting on Truman's order, bluntly stated that this move is a "new shift" in its China policy, that is, the US is "moving towards directly assisting the Chinese government fighting the Communists." Under the "stipulated task" of the United States, Chiang Kai-shek has presented all of Qingdao to the United States. According to TASS on the 29th: The Chiang's Shanghai Customs has announced that foreign ships shall not enter Qingdao without special permission. Ta Kung Pao said: Qingdao is blocked due to "military reasons." The so-called "military reasons" mean that Qingdao has become a naval base for the US Seventh Mixed Fleet, allowing only US ships to enter. It also said: The Qingdao authorities have been instructed by Nanjing to start requisitioning private houses and evicting landlords and tenants for the continued stationing of US troops.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Henan Front, 3rd: Chiang's troops fight, US troops reward; the US and Chiang collude, revealing their ugly state. According to the recent captured telegram No. 36 from the headquarters of the Chiang army's 47th Division to Regiment Commander Luo of the 359th Regiment, it said: "Approved First Logistics Station Headquarters Jing Er Zi No. 1293 telegram: Received United Logistics Headquarters Bei Hui Jing Gan telegram: It is found that the US military rations for rewarding the pacification troops in the Zhengzhou area have been transported from Hankou to Zhengzhou, and you should distribute and report them. and so on. It is found that these rewards have now arrived, and the quantity of distribution has been reviewed and approved by the Pacification Office... you should send personnel to the department to collect them." This kind of US military rations, the 47th Division alone received more than 22,800 catties at a time, including "C" type ration canned food, etc. Who knew that Chiang Kai-shek failed to live up to his American father's expectations, losing every battle he fought. This time, the People's Liberation Army captured many such rewards.

　　美蒋进一步勾结进攻人民
    美国给蒋贼军舰
    蒋介石出卖青岛
    【新华社陕北二日电】蒋美反动派狼狈为奸，加速变中国为美国殖民地，镇压中国人民爱国运动的罪恶活动，由于最近美国“移赠”剩余舰艇与蒋贼公开将青岛卖给美国作军事基地而获得进一步的发展。据美新闻处讯：美政府于上月二十七日下令将剩余舰艇二百七十一艘“移赠”蒋政府，并派遣海军军官一百名、士兵二百名协助蒋家海军，但“任务由美海军部长予以规定”。美国务院发言人却公开说明了：此次“移赠”及长期援华计划中之一部分，规定了“移赠”舰艇之任务为海岸巡逻应付“海盗”。并指明，“按照目前之处置”，美方将在青岛设立“海军使团”。美华盛顿明星报于评论杜鲁门此一命令时，更干脆说明了此举为对华政策之“新转变”，即美国“走向直接援助与共产党搏斗之中国政府”。在美国“规定任务”之下，蒋介石则已将青岛全部捧呈美国。据塔斯社二十九日息：蒋记上海海关已宣布非得特别允许，外国船只不得驶入青岛。大公报称：青岛因“军事原因”而封锁。所谓“军事原因”即意味着青岛变为美国第七混合舰队之海军基地，仅许美国船舰入口。并称：青岛当局并已奉南京训令开始征用民房，驱逐房主及房客，以供继续开到的美军驻扎。
    【新华社豫北前线三日电】蒋军打仗，美军犒赏；美蒋狼狈为奸，丑态毕露。据最近豫北前线缴获蒋军整四十七师司令部致三五九团罗团长三十六号代电称：“准第一兵站总监部经二字一二九三号代电开：奉联勤总司令部北灰经干电开：查犒赏郑州区绥靖部队美军口粮已由汉运郑，仰即配发具报。等因。查此项犒品现已运到，并经绥署核定分发品量……仰即派员来部具领为要”。这种美军口粮，仅四十七师一次即领到二万二千八百多斤，包括“Ｃ”种口粮罐头等类。谁知蒋介石不替他美国爸爸争气，打一仗败一仗，这次人民解放军就缴获了许多这样的犒赏品。
