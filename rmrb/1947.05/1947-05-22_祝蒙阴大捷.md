　　Congratulations on the Great Victory at Mengyin
    After fierce fighting from the morning of the 14th to noon on the 16th, the Shandong People's Liberation Army completely annihilated the 74th Division headquarters of the invading Chiang Kai-shek troops and its three subordinate brigades, the 57th Brigade, the 51st Brigade, and the 58th Brigade, as well as one regiment of the 19th Brigade of the 83rd Division, in the Menglianggu area, more than fifty li southeast of Mengyin. This is a great victory.
    Chiang Kai-shek's offensive against the entire Liberated Area is currently concentrated only in Shandong and northern Shaanxi. The Hu Zongnan army in northern Shaanxi has suffered three disastrous defeats in Qinghuabian, Wayao Fort, and Panlong, and is now in a dilemma. In Shandong, after the defeat at Laiwu in February, Chiang Kai-shek concentrated thirteen reorganized divisions (including the 5th Corps, which has not yet been reorganized), thirty-four brigades, on the front line in April and launched another multi-pronged offensive. Although three brigades of the 72nd Division were annihilated in Tai'an at the end of April, and heavy losses were also inflicted on the Qingtuosi area on the Linyi-Mengyin highway in early May, the Chiang Kai-shek army continued to advance rashly. Chiang Kai-shek's Central News Agency, as in the past, greatly exaggerated this risky action and fabricated a lot of ridiculous rumors. They claimed that so many Communist troops had been annihilated here, so many bodies had been left there, and even that generals had been killed in action. As late as the 14th, Dong Xianguang, director of Chiang Kai-shek's press bureau, said in response to reporters' inquiries: "The government is pleased with the military developments in Shandong... the National Army has engaged and defeated the main force of the Communist army. It is believed that large-scale warfare in the province can be concluded soon." Just as this liar was "pleased" in his living room, the 74th Division, one of Chiang Kai-shek's few most elite units and one of the few core units attacking the Shandong Liberated Area, had been surrounded by the East China Field Army, commanded by Generals Chen Yi, Su Yu, and Tan Zhenlin, in the deep mountains of Menglianggu. The Central News Agency's telegram from Xuzhou on the 16th hesitantly revealed this news, saying that "the decisive battle in the area east of Mengyin... the intensity of the fighting is unprecedented." It also demanded that the besieged army "fight ten against one." But it was too late! This American-equipped reorganized division, led by Division Commander Zhang Lingfu (formerly commanded by Wang Jingwu), which served as the main force in occupying Huaiyin, Lianshui, Shuyang, and Linyi, has been completely annihilated. Chiang Kai-shek's offensive in Shandong has suffered another heavy blow. Even if he can regroup and take another risk, his difficulties will be even greater. His generals will have even less confidence, and his soldiers will have even less fighting spirit.
    The East China People's Liberation Army and the people of the East China Liberated Area have undertaken the most serious tasks and achieved the most glorious achievements in the Chinese people's patriotic self-defense war. From July of last year to the present, the East China People's Liberation Army has annihilated thirty entire brigades of Chiang Kai-shek's regular army (not including the regular army annihilated below the brigade level, in regiments and battalions, and all the annihilated puppet troops, security forces, traffic police, and returning corps). Namely, the 19th Brigade (one regiment of which was annihilated this time, a newly replenished unit), 92nd Brigade, 105th Brigade, Provisional 12th Division, and 26th Brigade in July of last year; the 79th Brigade, 99th Brigade, 187th Brigade, and New 7th Brigade in August; the 41st Brigade, 60th Brigade, and Pre-3rd Brigade in December; the 44th Brigade, 80th Brigade, 169th Brigade, 113th Brigade, and 114th Brigade in January of this year; the 15th Division, 77th Division, 193rd Division, New 36th Division, 175th Brigade, 188th Brigade, and New 19th Brigade in February; the 34th Brigade, New 13th Brigade, and New 15th Brigade in April; and the 51st Brigade, 57th Brigade, and 58th Brigade this time. Chiang Kai-shek used nearly one hundred brigades on the East China battlefield, attempting to determine the outcome of the war, but this subjective fantasy has approached its final demise.
    This victory at Mengyin has special significance in the history of the East China People's Liberation Army because: first, it struck at Chiang Kai-shek's most powerful and almost only offensive direction today. Second, it struck at Chiang Kai-shek's most elite troops (one of four or five elite divisions). Third, this blow occurred on the eve of a full-scale counteroffensive in the entire Liberated Area. Simultaneously with this victory, powerful counteroffensives are unfolding in Northeast China, northern Henan, southern Shanxi, and the Zhengtai area. We extend our warm congratulations and respect to the East China People's Liberation Army. We believe that the Shandong People's Liberation Army will, in the near future, completely crush Chiang Kai-shek's offensive, thereby enabling the entire Liberated Area to shift to a full-scale counteroffensive.

### 祝蒙阴大捷

　　祝蒙阴大捷
    山东人民解放军经过十四日晨到十六日午的激战，在蒙阴东南五十余华里的蒙山孟良崮地区，完全歼灭了进犯蒋军七十四师师部及其所属的五十七旅、五十一旅、五十八旅三个旅，和八十三师十九旅的一个团。这是一个伟大的胜利。
    蒋介石对于整个解放区的进攻，目前只集中于山东和陕北。陕北的胡宗南军，连遭青化砭、瓦窑堡、蟠龙三次惨败，已陷入进退维谷之境。山东方面，蒋介石在二月莱芜失败以后，四月又集中了十三个整编师（其中第五军尚未整编）卅四个旅于第一线，再次分路北犯。虽于四月底在泰安被歼七十二师三个旅，五月初在临沂，蒙阴公路上的青驼寺地区亦受重大损失，但蒋军依然继续冒进。蒋介石的中央社对于这个冒险行动，曾和历次一样大肆吹嘘，并造了一大堆可笑的谣言。说什么共军在此被歼几何，在彼遗尸若干，甚至说什么将军已经阵亡云云。直至十四日，蒋府新闻局长董显光在答复记者询问时还说：“政府对山东之军事发展引为满意…………国军已与共军主力接触而击破之。相信该省大规模战事不久可以结束”。正当这个说谎者在客厅中“引为满意”的时候，蒋介石极少数最精锐部队之一，与进攻山东解放区的极少数中坚部队之一的七十四师，却已经被陈毅、粟裕、谭震林三位将军所统率的、威名远震的华东野战军团团包围在孟良崮的深山之中。中央社徐州十六日电，吞吞吐吐地透露了这个消息，说是“蒙阴以东地区之决战…………战事之烈，前所仅见”。并要求被围的军队“以一当十”。但是晚了！这个占淮阴、占涟水、占沭阳、占临沂都充当主力，为师长张灵甫率领（过去王经武任军长）的美械整编师，业已全军覆灭。蒋介石对山东的进攻又受了一次惨重打击。他即使还能够重整旗鼓，再次冒险，但是他的困难更大了。他的将领们将更加缺少信心，他的士兵们将更加缺少斗志了。
    华东人民解放军和华东解放区的人民，在全中国人民的爱国自卫战争中，担负的任务最严重，得到的成就也最荣耀。从去年七月到现在，华东人民解放军已经歼灭了蒋介石正规军三十个整旅（旅以下成团成营被歼灭的正规军，及全部被歼灭的伪军、保安部队、交警、还乡团等，均未计算在内）。即去年七月份的十九旅（这次被歼的一个团，是后来补充的新部队）、九十二旅、一○五旅、暂十二师、廿六旅，八月份的七十九旅、九十九旅、一八七旅、新七旅，十二月份的四十一旅、六十旅、预三旅，今年一月份的四十四旅、八十旅、一六九旅、一一三旅、一一四旅，二月份的十五师、七十七师、一九三师、新三十六师、一七五旅、一八八旅、新十九旅，四月份的三十四旅、新十三旅、新十五旅和这次的五十一旅、五十七旅、五十八旅。蒋介石以近一百个旅使用于华东战场，欲以此决定两军胜负，这个主观幻想业已接近于最后破灭。
    这次蒙阴胜利，在华东人民解放军的历史上更有特殊意义，因为：第一，这是打击了蒋介石今天最强大的和几乎唯一的进攻方向。第二，这是打击了蒋介石的最精锐部队（四、五个精锐师之一个）。第三，这个打击是出现于全解放区全面反攻的前夜。和这次胜利同时，东北、豫北、晋南、正太等地，强大的反攻正在展开。我们谨向华东人民解放军致热烈的祝贺和敬意。我们相信：山东人民解放军将于不久的将来，彻底粉碎蒋介石的进攻，从而使全解放区转入全面反攻。
