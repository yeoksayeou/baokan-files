Good Leadership Ensures Good Production:
	Summary of Spring Planting in Cheyuan Village, Licheng
	Labor Hero Cadres Take the Lead in Organizing Production Throughout the Village

	Cheyuan Village in the Fifth District of Licheng, after a month of intensive work, has completed the planting of 579 mu of millet, 351 mu of corn, and 133 mu of cotton throughout the village, and weeded 354 mu of wheat. At the beginning of the spring plowing, Cheyuan, based on the current situation, faced the new difficulty of insufficient labor, which affected the masses' confidence in production, as both production and support for the front lines required a large amount of labor. In order to complete the production and war service tasks, model cadre Guo Tianfu and labor heroes Lu Jicai and Wang Qishun took the lead, and on April 15th, they raised the issue of intensive planting at the people's school. Jicai also announced his team's plan for a month of intensive planting, and proposed slogans such as: "Early planting yields a harvest, late planting yields nothing; early planting means enough to eat, late planting means losing your bowl; take advantage of the soil and plant quickly, don't mess around when there's no soil." Pay attention to technique and don't deceive, people don't fail the land, and the land doesn't fail people. At the same time, the leadership, together with the Technical Committee, based on the seasons, climate, and characteristics of the crops, through group discussions and research, made specific arrangements for life, overcoming the problem of temporary random grabs. This improved the masses' confidence in production and laid the foundation for action.

	After making specific arrangements for living time, labor and animal power were organized. Since 25 of the 40 livestock were sick, human-powered plows were organized, and 45 children and 30 women from the village were organized to participate in production. Labor hero Lu Jicai further realized that more surplus labor could be squeezed out with more people, as long as the leadership was concerned and had a plan, both small and large groups could be led. He discussed with Kong Xianrong's team to merge the groups into a labor cooperative, and carried out various combinations of land-based work calculation, labor force rating, land responsibility by the cooperative, and labor force controlled by the cooperative (supporting the work, participating in the war, substituting cultivation, agriculture, sideline occupations, etc.). Methods such as working by task, the relationship between people and the community using work tickets, and grading dividends were established. The original mutual aid organization was further improved.

	In terms of deep plowing and careful cultivation, the Technical Committee was first improved. Guo Guirong, who had been trained at Changzhi Agricultural School, and experienced old farmers Guo Deming and Yang Fengji, and others were invited as members of the Technical Committee to be responsible for technical leadership and seasonal research of techniques. For example, when planting cotton, the reason why the seeds rotted and did not sprout last year was reviewed, because the seeds were scalded with boiling water, planted too early, and the ground was too cold to germinate, and planted too deep. The Technical Committee also guided seed soaking. All the 811 millet planted in the village was soaked in salt water, and the Golden Queen variety was soaked in warm water. In terms of fertilization, an average of 40 loads per mu were applied. This combination of labor and technology saved labor and improved yields.

	Carry out current affairs education to improve production awareness

	Significant achievements have been made in combining production and learning. The children of Cheyuan School combined learning with production, learning what they do. For example, when transporting fertilizer, the lower grades learned the two characters "transport fertilizer," receiving the characters at school in the morning and recognizing, speaking, and writing them from memory at school after dinner. The higher grades wrote fertilizer transport diaries, which were handed in to the teacher for review in the evening, pointing out the advantages and disadvantages, and learned arithmetic during the rest time after lunch. Lu Jicai's team also organized the learning of abacus calculation, using life as the subject, and doing calculations during rest, such as when weeding wheat, five people weeded 80 rows a day, and learned division by calculating how many rows each person weeded. When planting millet, they learned multiplication by calculating how many legs there were in total with one drill having three legs and a total of 45 drills being used. Literacy was also done in the same way, learning what they did. According to inspection, in one month, five people including Fu Taocheng learned multiplication and division, and six people including Lu Zhongtang and Yang Tianhui learned 30 new characters.

	In terms of current affairs education, the content of the propaganda was first unified as anti-Chiang American commercial treaty, and daily propaganda programs were specifically stipulated. For example, one day was "A bloody traitorous contract"; the second day was "Chiang Kai-shek opens the door wide for his foreign fathers to kowtow"; the third day was "How should we tear up this traitorous contract." In terms of propaganda form, propaganda groups (mainly children) were organized to talk at the meal market during lunch and dinner, and each group went to the fields to discuss during breaks, so that all the masses in the village understood Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous behavior and how they should actively produce to support the front lines and tear up this traitorous contract. By linking production with the patriotic self-defense war, political consciousness was raised, and production enthusiasm was further stimulated.

	Launch a meritorious service campaign

	After the development of production work, labor hero Lu Jicai proposed a meritorious service campaign on the production line at the people's school. He first announced his conditions for meritorious service: to lead the production work of the whole village well, to organize all the households in the village, and to ensure that the members of the mutual aid group under his leadership are upright and work hard in production. Model cadre Guo Tianfu, on behalf of the cadres, put forward the conditions for cadres to perform meritorious service: actively participate in production, ensure that wives participate in weaving; do not be complacent or selfish, take into account both public and private interests, and honestly serve the masses; the work style should be democratic; guarantee to lead a mutual aid group well, and ensure that every family in the group achieves "cultivate three and save one"; learn more and write communications to newspapers, and help others learn. After deliberation by the masses, everyone discussed and came up with: participate in mutual aid and strive to be a model; actively produce, help military and cadre families, and support the front lines; set a plan to achieve "cultivate three and save one," as the conditions for the masses to perform meritorious service. Finally, it was agreed that a small record of merit would be made every ten days, and a major record of merit would be made at the end of a campaign. The meritorious service campaign played an encouraging role in spring plowing and sowing.

　　领导得好，生产就能搞好。
    黎城车元村春耕下种总结
  　劳英干部带头组织全村生产
    黎城五区车元村，经过一个月的突击，把全村五百七十九亩谷子，三百五十一亩玉茭，一百三十三亩棉花都种完了，并锄了三百五十四亩麦子。春耕开始，车元根据当前情况，一方面是生产，一方面又是支援前线，两件工作都同样需用大批劳力，因而发生了劳力不足的新困难，影响群众生产信心。为了完成生产与战勤任务，车元村模范干部郭天福、劳英芦计财、王起顺等起带头作用，于四月十五日在民校提出突击下种的问题。计财又宣布了自己组里一个月突击下种计划，并提出：早种收，迟种丢；早种吃饱饭，迟种丢了碗；趁垧快种，没垧胡混。注意技术不胡哄，人不亏地地不亏人等口号。同时领导上会同技委会，根据节令气候与农作物的特性，通过各组讨论研究后，把生活作了具体按排，克服临时乱抓的毛病。这样提高群众生产信心，打下行动的基础。
    生活时间具体按排后，即组织劳畜力。由于四十头牲口病了二十五头，于是组织了人力犁，并组织全村儿童四十五人，妇女三十人参加生产。劳英芦计财更体验到人多能够挤出更多的剩余劳力来，只要领导上操心有计划，小组大组一样领导。他就和孔显荣组商议，把各组合并成立了劳力合作社，并进行了按地计工，按劳力评分，地由合作社负责，劳力由合作社支配的各方面结合（支差、参战、代耕、农业、副业等）。并订出按活计工，人与社发生关系使用工票与定级分红等办法。把原有的互助组织更提高了一步。
    在深耕细作方面，首先健全技委会，请了长治农校受过训的郭贵荣与富有经验的老农郭德明、杨逢吉等九人为技术委员会，负责技术方面领导，按季节的研究技术。如栽花时，即检讨出去年烂籽不出苗的原因，是因为滚水汤种，种的早了，地冷不发芽，以及种的太深所致。技委会并指导浸种，全村种八一一谷，完全用盐汤浸过，金皇后用温汤浸种。施肥方面，每亩平均上四十驮。这样把劳力与技术结合起来，省了工又能提高产量。
  　进行时事教育提高生产自觉
    生产与学习结合方面，有显著的成绩。车元学校儿童学习与生产结合，做啥学啥。比如运肥时，低年级即学“运肥”二字，清早到校领字，晚饭后到学校认讲默写。高年级即写运肥日记，晚上交给老师批阅，指出优缺点，午饭后趁休息时间学算术。芦计财组也组织学打算盘，以生活为题，休息时作计算，如锄麦时一天五人锄八十垅，每人锄几垅来学除法。种谷时即以一耧三条腿，共用四十五个耧共几条腿，来学乘法。识字也同样做啥学啥。据检查，一个月中，该组学会乘、除法有傅桃成等五人，学会三十个生字的有芦中堂、杨天会等六人。
    时事教育方面，首先统一了宣传内容为反蒋美商约，又具体规定了逐日宣传节目。如一日是“一张血腥的卖国契约”；二日为“蒋介石大开门儿给洋爸爸磕头”；三日为“我们怎样来撕毁这张卖国契约”。在宣传形式上，是组织宣传小组（主要是儿童），于午饭时、晚饭时在饭市上谈，各小组到地里休息下讨论，这样使全村群众都了解了蒋介石卖国行为与自已应当如何积极生产支援前线，撕毁这张卖国契约。把生产和爱国自卫战争联系起来，提高了政治觉悟，又进一步激发了生产的热情。
　  开展立功运动
    生产工作开展之后，劳动英雄芦计财在民校提出生产线上立功运动。他首先宣布了自己的立功条件：领导好全村生产工作，把全村所有户儿都组织起来，领导的互助组员，个个正派努力生产。模范干部郭天福代表干部提出了干部立功条件：积极参加生产，保证老婆参加纺织；不自满自私，公私兼顾，老实为群众服务；作风要民主；保证领导好一个互助组，并保证小组家家做到耕三余一；多学习给报纸写通讯，并帮助别人学习。群众酝酿后，大家又讨论出：参加互助争取模范；积极生产，帮助军、干属支援前线；订出计划做到耕三余一等，为群众立功条件。最后又商定了十天一小记功，一个运动结束一大记功。立功运动，在春耕下种中，起了鼓舞作用。
