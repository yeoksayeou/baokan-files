    Ningnan Mobilizes Over 20,000 People
    Seizes River Management During Spring Plowing
    [Jinan News, 3rd of this month] Ningnan is seizing the gaps in spring plowing to manage rivers, mobilizing 23,000 people from 130 villages, preparing to complete the first and second phases of the project in one go. Since April 15th, over 7,000 young and middle-aged men from 44 villages in the first district have gathered on both banks of the North Sha River to begin construction. Cadres and militiamen from villages such as Gaozhuang and Qian Zhangmeng are competing in digging the river, proposing to "complete seven days of work in four days with a concentrated effort." The county and district river management committees have already prepared award banners to give to river management models.
    [Jinan News, 3rd of this month] The Jinnan First Administrative Office recently convened a joint meeting of construction section chiefs from various counties, deciding to dredge rivers and channels to prevent the Yellow River from entering the Wei River and causing disasters, and to build water conservancy projects for the people. Linqing County is rebuilding the Wei River levee, totaling over 200 li in length, repairing 22 levee sections, and straightening three river bends. Guantao County is repairing a levee 1,767 zhang long and also attaching 9,300 zhang of the Zhang River levee. In Yuancheng, 200 sections of the Wei River levee were washed away last year, and wave nests also need to be repaired. The Jin Xian River will also be attached, which passes through Yuancheng and Shen County. This year, it has been decided that Yuancheng will build a new levee 360 zhang long. In Shen County, the river bend is 10 li long, and the levee along the bank will be repaired once. Regarding the issue of dredging channels, the channel dredging plans for counties such as Wuxun, Shen County, Yuancheng, Yongzhi, and Guan County have been drafted. If completed according to the plan, it can reduce floods and increase production. Guantao's dredging of three channels can reduce flooding of over 60 qing of land. Yuancheng is digging two smooth channels in the Hongyan River, and Xin Village alone can avoid flooding 80 qing of land. If the above projects are completed, even if there is as much rain as last year, it can reduce flooding of 448,232 mu of good farmland. Calculating at a minimum yield of 50 jin of grain per mu, it can yield an additional 22,411,600 jin of grain. Currently, Guan and Shen have already started construction, and other counties are actively preparing.

    宁南动员两万余人
    春耕间隙抓紧治河
    【本报冀南三日电】宁南抓紧春耕间隙治河，动员一百三十村，两万三千人，准备将第一、第二两期工程一次完成。自四月十五日起，一区四十四村，七千多青壮年，集合于北沙河两岸，开始动工。高庄、前张孟等村干部、民兵，在挖河中竞相挑战，提出“七天的工四天要突击完成”。县、区治河委员会已制好奖旗，准备给予治河模范。
    【本报冀南三日电】冀南一专署日前召开各县建设科长联席会，决定挖河疏渠，防止黄水入卫成灾，为民兴修水利。临清县市重修卫河河堤，计长二百余里，修堤二十二处，直河湾三处。馆陶县修堤长一千七百六十七丈，同时附修漳河堤九千三百丈。元城卫堤去年被水冲二百处，浪窝亦要补修，附修金线河，此河经元城、莘县，今年决定元城修新堤三百六十丈。莘县直湾十里，补修沿堤一遍。关于疏渠问题，武训、莘县、元朝、永智、冠县等县疏渠计划已经拟就，如按计划完成可以减少水灾，增加产量。馆陶疏渠三道，即能减淹地六十多顷。元城在红眼江内挖顺渠两道，仅辛庄一道渠就能免淹地八十顷。以上各项工程如完竣，再有象去年那样大的雨水，也可少淹地四十四万八千二百三十二亩良田，按每亩最低收粮五十斤计，能多收粮二千二百四十一万一千六百斤。现在冠、莘已开始动工，其他县正在积极准备。
