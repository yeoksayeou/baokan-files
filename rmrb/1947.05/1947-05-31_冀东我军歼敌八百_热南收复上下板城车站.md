Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 29th—A unit of the Jidong People's Liberation Army captured Shenhe Town (about 15 miles north of Beidaihe), an important stronghold of the Chiang army, at 5:00 a.m. on the 23rd. More than 800 people, including the commander of the 2nd Regiment of the pseudo-Northeast Security Force, were captured, and the spoils are being inventoried.

Also: On the 22nd, a unit of the Southern Rehe People's Army captured Shangbancheng, an important station on the Jin-Cheng Railway more than 40 miles southeast of Chengde, in one fell swoop. Nineteen members of the 3rd Column of the Rehe Security Force were captured alive, and 13 rifles and more than 2,400 rounds of ammunition were seized. On the 23rd, they took advantage of the victory to recover the Xiabancheng station, and the defending enemy fled in panic.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th—According to a message from the US News Office in Tanggu: The US ammunition depot in Xinhe, Tanggu, was officially handed over to the Chiang government on April 21. Howard, commander of the 1st Marine Division of the US Marine Corps, said: This transfer is an emergency measure and is not bound by any Sino-US agreement. It is generally believed that this move by the US military clearly shows that the People's Liberation Army's bombing of the Xinhe ammunition depot has fully exposed the truth about its assistance to Chiang Kai-shek in the civil war. Now it simply and shamelessly exposes its accomplice's hideous face.

　　冀东我军歼敌八百
  　热南收复上下板城车站
    【新华社晋察冀二十九日电】冀东人民解放军一部，二十三日晨五时攻克蒋军重要据点深河镇（北戴河北约十五里）。俘伪东北保安队二团团长以下八百余人，缴获正清查中。
    又：二十二日热南子弟兵一部一举攻克承德东南四十余里锦承路上重要车站上板城。生俘热河保安三纵队十九名，缴长枪十三支，子弹二千四百余发。二十三日乘胜收复下板城车站，守敌仓惶逃窜。
    【新华社陕北二十日电】据天津美新闻处消息：塘沽新河之美军火库，已于四月二十一日正式移交蒋政府，美陆战队第一纵司令何华德称：此次移交系应急措施，不受任何中美协定之约束。一般认为，美军此举，显为人民解放军炸毁新河军火库，已完全揭发其助蒋内战之真相，现在就无赖的把帮凶狰狞面目干脆公开暴露出来。
