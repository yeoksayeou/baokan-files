　　Pay Attention to Famine Preparedness and Overcome Waste
　　To the Editor:
    This spring has been dry with little rain, and the sowing and seedling emergence of some crops has been affected. However, waste phenomena still exist in various places. For example, in ×× Village, Lucheng, the land was originally barren and unproductive, but since it was leveled and supplemented, some people have been eating and drinking excessively, thinking that eating it is a gain. There are also many households that eat noodles almost every meal, and also eat fried “qi” (likely refers to a kind of snack) outside of the three meals. According to actual interviews, although the masses have been emancipated, their grain reserves are very low. We should be frugal and focus on drought prevention and famine preparedness, and resolutely overcome this phenomenon!

    Editor's Note: The opinions of comrades Qi Ke and Wen Hui deserve widespread attention. The Central Bureau issued instructions on practicing strict economy and preparing for famine early on (see this newspaper on March 18), but it is far from being universally and deeply implemented among the masses. The masses in Shentou Village, Neiqiu, are organized to sow seeds while paying attention to carrying out drought prevention and famine preparedness education. We must turn slogans into actions. Their practices and spirit are worth promoting in various places. According to the materials we have received, many places have also paid attention to this work. For example, the fourth, fifth, and parts of the first districts of Pingshun County are already conducting or are in the process of conducting production and thrift propaganda, which are all very good. We hope that this movement can be rapidly universalized and deepened, and resolutely overcome the unwarranted waste phenomenon.

### 注意备荒克服浪费

专栏：读者意见

　　注意备荒克服浪费编辑同志：
    今春天旱不雨，一些作物的播种捉苗已受影响，但各地尚存在有浪费现象，例如潞城××村，本来地薄寡产，但自填平补齐后，部分人大吃大喝，认为吃了是赚的。还有很多家户，每天差不多吃一顿面，还有在三顿饭外吃炒棋。据实际访问，群众虽翻了身，但存粮是很少的，应该细水长流，从防旱备荒着眼，切实克服这种现象！
　          读者  起科、文辉
　　　　
    编者按：起科、文辉两同志意见值得引起普遍注意。厉行节约备荒，中央局早发有指示（见三月十八日本报），但普遍与深入贯彻到群众中去，还远远不够，内邱神头村群众组织起来点种，同时注意开展防旱备荒教育，要把口号变成行动，他们的做法与精神，很值得在各地推行。据我们所收材料，不少地方也已注意了这一工作，如平顺四、五区和一区部分村庄都已经或正在进行生产节约宣传，都是很好的，希望这一运动能迅速普遍与深入，切实克服不应有的浪费现象。
