　　Both Male and Female Labor and Livestock Participate Together
    Heshun's Two Districts Complete Sowing
    Zuoquan's Shuipo and Other Villages Use Human-Pulled Plows and Seed Drills for Crash Sowing
    [Our Newspaper Heshun News] The Third and Fourth Districts adopted the method of centralized use of labor for large-scale work exchange, completing the sowing of over 110,000 mu in seven days. The methods adopted by the Fourth District were: First, the labor and livestock of each village were organized uniformly, distributed uniformly, and flexible adjustments were made between teams and groups. Second, women in each village stopped spinning for seven days and all went to the fields. For example, in Tuling, 70 women, led by the chairwoman of the Women's Salvation Association, all went to the fields. Six women alone sowed ten mu of grain in one day, saving four male laborers. Third, the staff of the cooperative went to the fields completely during the day and returned to sell goods at night. Fourth, labor and livestock were used reasonably with precise calculations, and the system of fixed quotas with flexible evaluation, equal-value work recording, exchange of work difference tickets, and mutual use of work tickets was conscientiously implemented. Fifth, all transportation livestock stopped transportation for seven days to participate in the crash effort. In order to participate in the war and not delay sowing, the Third District organized crash sowing committees in each village to divide the work of labor adjustment, preferential treatment for military families, and substitute cultivation. Under the promotion and leadership of this organization, all male and female labor and livestock in the district participated in sowing, completing it in seven and a half days. (Qiming)
    [Our Newspaper Zuoquan News] Under the slogan of supporting the front line and actively organizing participation in the war while not delaying sowing, the villages in the Fifth District began on April 18th by first rectifying mutual aid and conducting ideological education. After breaking the ideas of fearing to become wealthy and waiting for replenishment, production enthusiasm was greatly increased. The entire district entered a period of intense crash sowing. Houzhuang Village solved the old habits of some elderly people rigidly sowing according to the season and the idea that "a seedling planted between Small Full and Grain in Ear is worth two." After everyone discussed it, the result was that "it is better to take advantage of the arable land than to follow the solar term," and also that "most of the labor force has to participate in the war and cannot be compared to previous years." The four large teams in the village proposed mutual competition. Strong women went to the fields during the day and spun cotton at night. Schools and factories also took holidays to help with sowing. In Shuipo, Silizhuang, Donghuangzhang, and other villages, mutual aid groups all divided the work according to each person's strengths. Livestock plowed the land, people pulled seed drills, and people even organized human-pulled plows in Gedaogou. The approximately 400 mu of land in Naoze Ditch Village has been completely sown. According to statistics at the end of April, over 15,000 mu have been sown in the entire district. Except for three villages, the rest of the district will be able to complete sowing in eight days.

    [Our Newspaper Jinnan Telegram, 10th] The Seventh District of Yuanchao has been fully engaged in rushing to plow and sow since the eighth day of the third lunar month. The leadership proposed to first sow the land of military families, then the land of those participating in the war, and then concentrate manpower and livestock to plow all the land before river management. The Yangcun Village cadres mobilized the masses of the entire village and first distributed two mules to each military family to plow the land and one mule to deliver manure. Within five or six days, they plowed all the land of the six military families finely and deeply, and sowed sorghum. The military families were so happy that they wrote letters to the soldiers at the front, telling them to fight Lao Jiang with peace of mind. In a few days, Yuanzhuang Village plowed all the land in the village and completely sowed sorghum and millet. All villages in the county have entered a period of intense sowing action.
