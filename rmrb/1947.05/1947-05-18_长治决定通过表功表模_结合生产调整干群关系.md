　　Changzhi Decides to Adjust Cadre-Masses Relations Through Commendation and Modeling Combined with Production Adjustments

　　[This newspaper Changzhi News] The Changzhi County Committee recently issued instructions to solve the cadre-masses relationship in combination with production, to achieve close unity between cadres and the masses, and to carry out the great production movement. The instructions propose solutions based on the four types of cadre-masses relationship villages in the county: For villages where the cadre-masses relationship is good, or some problems have been solved, there should be no re-mobilization. The main focus should be on inspiring cadres to make contributions on the production front and to strengthen the cadre-masses relationship through production. For villages where the cadre-masses relationship is basically good, with only some individual problems, a movement should not be launched either. Efforts should be made to solve them through individual small-scale methods to prevent them from developing. Cadres should have individual heart-to-heart talks with the masses who have opinions to resolve the conflicts. For villages where problems were raised in the previous stage but not resolved, resulting in dissatisfaction on both sides (cadres being hurt and dissatisfied, the masses complaining that raising opinions is useless), and both sides have grievances, if the problems are serious, the district should organize forces to help solve them specifically. The solution should value the enthusiasm and contributions of cadres, as well as the emotions of the masses, valuing both sides, letting both sides have the say, first commending and modeling, and guiding self-criticism to resolve the conflicts. For villages where the cadre-masses relationship has deteriorated, where no work was done in the previous stage, and problems were not exposed, solutions should be sought appropriately based on the above principles, depending on the strength of the forces. In addition, in resolving the cadre-masses relationship, some specific outstanding issues must be resolved, because the poor cadre-masses relationship is due to the existence of many specific problems. To date, many villages still have some fruits, or unclear accounts, which should be resolutely and thoroughly cleaned up by the masses, fully distributed, and announced. At the same time, cadres who have received more fruits should be patiently persuaded and mobilized to voluntarily and consciously return them. Furthermore, in resolving the problems, discussions and opinions can be combined with mutual aid teams, without holding special meetings separate from production. Individual problems should be handled individually, without conflicting with the production of the masses.

　　长治决定通过表功表模
    结合生产调整干群关系
    【本报长治讯】长治县委会顷发出指示，结合生产解决干群关系，做到干群紧密团结，开展大生产运动。指示根据全县干群关系四种类型村提出解决方针：一种是干群关系就好，或有些问题已得到解决的村庄，不应再次发动，主要是启发干部在生产战线上立功，在生产中密切干群关系。二种是干群关系基本上是好的，只有一些个别问题，也不应发动一个运动，应尽量采取个别的小型的方法去求得解决，不使之发展。干部要和有意见的群众个别谈心，解开圪瘩。三种是由于前段把问题提出了，没得到解决，形成了两头不满意（干部被剌伤不满意，群众反映提意见不顶事），两头有牢骚，问题严重的村庄，应当组织区上力量，具体帮助去解决。解决方针是宝贵干部热情与功劳，也宝贵群众情绪，两头宝贵，两头作主，首先表功表模，引导自我批评解开圪瘩。四种是干群关系恶化，前段未搞，问题未暴露，应看力量情况，适当的根据以上方针去求得解决。此外在解决干群关系中，必须解决若干具体遗留问题，因为干群关系不好，都是有许多具体问题的存在，到目前为止，有许多村或多或少还存有些果实，或帐目不清，应坚决的经过群众彻底清理果实，全部分完并公布。同时干部多得的果实，要经过耐心说服动员，使之自愿自觉的退出来。再次，在解决中，可以结合互助组进行讨论提意见，不要脱离生产召开专门大会，个别问题个别处理，不要和群众生产冲突。
