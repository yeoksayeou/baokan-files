Close Cooperation Between Labor and Management Leads to Prosperity for Pengcheng Ceramics

Pengcheng, a well-known ceramic production area in North China, had as many as 200 pottery and porcelain kilns and more than 4,000 workers during its peak prosperity in the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937). At that time, convenient transportation allowed sales to the Northeast, as well as the Pingjin (Beijing-Tianjin) areas, attracting a constant flow of ceramic merchants from various regions. Hence, it was known as "Pengcheng, a thousand miles away," and "earning a fortune every day."

The porcelain workers, besides the locals, included people from Anyang and Shanxi. The vast majority of them had no house or land at home and started as apprentices at the kilns from a young age. The apprenticeship lasted for four to five years for a shorter period, and seven to eight years for a longer period, before they could become skilled workers. Among the sixty-odd kiln owners, more than fifty were landlords cum kiln owners. The kiln owners who also managed land owned as much as three or four hundred mu, generally fifty or sixty mu, and at least twenty mu.

In the winter of the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), Pengcheng was occupied and invaded by the enemy and puppets (Japanese and their collaborators), and the ceramic industry suffered tremendous destruction. At that time, except for a few large kiln owners who colluded with the enemy and puppets to continue operating, most small and medium-sized kiln owners either struggled to maintain their business due to capital difficulties or closed down due to the oppression of the enemy and puppets. After Pengcheng was liberated in August two years ago, the government immediately allocated 4,000 jin of grain and provided 150,000 yuan in loans to support and relieve the industry to resume production. Soon, forty-four pottery and porcelain kilns resumed operation, and more than a thousand workers returned to work. At the same time, the trade union led the workers to start struggles against special agents, traitors, local bullies, etc., to seek revenge and recover blood debts. This caused panic among a few large kiln owners, who adopted a negative and wait-and-see attitude towards production.

Last August, most of the porcelain workers participated in the movement to thoroughly eliminate feudal landlords cum large kiln owners. However, general small and medium-sized kiln owners expressed fear and doubt. Despite repeated explanations, they were not convinced. Coupled with the constant shortage of capital, stagnant sales, high raw material prices, and other reasons, a crisis emerged in the development of the ceramic industry.

In January of this year, the trade union reviewed that last year's focus on resolving land issues sometimes neglected the work on the workers' side. It dispatched two cadres to go deep into each kiln to investigate the resumption of work and related issues. The investigation revealed that only thirty-five pottery kilns out of seventy-odd could resume operation. The remaining thirty could not resume operation temporarily because the kiln owners were undergoing liquidation and lacked raw materials. Subsequently, the trade union convened a meeting of more than one hundred and twenty cadres, activists, and group leaders to study the issue of mobilizing production and resumption of work. Wheel worker Hu Wan'gen said: "Last year, the kiln owners were afraid of struggle, did not take responsibility, and did not prepare raw materials." Spinner Ma Yu'rong said: "Last year's three capital increases and loans affected this year's resumption of work." Craftsman Zhang Ke'shun said: "Last year, the trade union advocated labor-capital cooperation and mutual benefit for labor and capital. But last year everyone increased capital three times. The others lost money, and we benefited. But if the kiln owners lose money, they cannot continue. If they don't continue, we will lose our jobs. If we earn less and cannot afford to live, we won't do it either. In my opinion, it is better to earn less than to earn more. If we earn less, others will benefit, and we will not lose our jobs and will have money to earn." Wheel worker Niu Yuqing said: "How do we know if they are losing money? There are profits and losses in business. It is only acceptable to earn and not to lose. When the enemy was here, where did the money they earned go?" Molder Zhang Shan said: "Let's not talk like that. Let's not just criticize the kiln owners without criticizing ourselves. Last year, some of us borrowed five or six thousand yuan, some borrowed eight or nine thousand yuan, or even ten thousand yuan, but we only borrowed and didn't repay. We increased capital and still asked for money for alcohol. That kind of 'small change'! In my opinion, we should get rid of the unreasonable things left over from the past. Now we earn a lot of wages. Some earn one thousand three or four hundred yuan a day, and some earn five or six hundred yuan. That's not a small amount. Even if it's less, we have houses to live in and land to farm. The money we earn from two years of work cannot buy these houses and land." Wheel worker Suo Mingshan said: "The kiln owners relied on public money to cooperate with each other and became staff members. We increased capital, and they also increased capital. Last year, it rained heavily on the kiln and damaged the bowl blanks, but they didn't care. They lit the fire and didn't check the size, drinking tea and smoking foreign cigarettes all day, and eating noodles. They didn't say anything about waste. We only criticize ourselves and don't say anything about this." Wheel worker Guo Shunqing said: "No matter how we criticize, the kiln owners are losing money. Some people say they are not losing money. Let's calculate the accounts for them to see if they are really losing money. If the kiln owners are really losing money, we must not only get rid of the various kinds of alcohol money and 'small change' left over from the past but also reduce our wages." After such a heated discussion, everyone had a clearer understanding of how to resume work and how labor-capital mutual benefit could lead to production being better than before. Therefore, everyone said: Guo Shunqing's words are correct. Then they began to calculate the accounts.

The result of the calculation was that the raw materials, shop employee wages, and all miscellaneous expenses for a pottery kiln totaled 1.05 million yuan, and the wages of workers in each department totaled 670,000 yuan. The total of the above two expenses was more than 1.7 million yuan, while the value of a kiln of goods was 1.5 million yuan. According to this calculation, everyone thought it was fair, but it was still a loss of more than 200,000 yuan. At this time, worker Ma Yu'rong said: "What should we do if the others are losing money?" Everyone said: "If the others are losing money, everyone will have their wages reduced. Can we only increase and not decrease? When the water rises, the boat rises; when the water falls, the boat falls. It's not shameful to reduce wages." Painter Yao Mei hurriedly said: "How much should we reduce our wages?" Zhang Kechun said: "Reduce it by 30%, earning up to 1,000 yuan, so that the others will not lose money." As a result, everyone raised their hands in agreement.

In order to further understand the requirements and difficulties of the kiln owners, two cadres went to the industrial and commercial porcelain shops to make individual visits on the issue of resuming work. Manager Dai Haoran said: "This year's resumption of work is really difficult. There is little working capital, and we cannot buy raw materials. Only six of the eight kilns can resume work, and we will have to stop work in May. Last year, we had five or six million yuan in capital. After deducting all the shop expenses and worker wages, the workers also temporarily borrowed 1.8 million yuan. In this way, there is not much money left. Even if we borrow five or six hundred thousand yuan from the bank, we cannot continue for long." Staff member Han Shiyou said: "Last year, the raw materials were expensive, and it is true that there were difficulties in increasing capital and borrowing money three times. In my opinion, we should review ourselves. Everyone did not take responsibility. It rained on the kiln and damaged the bowl blanks, but no one cared. Can we blame the workers for this?" Staff member Ji Fushan also rushed to say: "If we want to review, we should focus on reviewing ourselves. In my opinion, the raw materials and coal were very cheap last spring. At that time, the public invested several times, but we didn't buy raw materials and coal, and the money was gone. When the goods became expensive in the second half of the year, how could we make money without raw materials? The workers increased capital, and we also increased capital. How could we not lose money." Kiln owner Zhang Shulin said: "To be honest, last year we were really afraid of struggle. My family had more than fifty mu of land, which was liquidated by the masses. We cooperated with the public to run the kiln just to get something to eat and drink. This year, we understand that the government's protection of industry and commerce is real, so we are not afraid. I am willing to take out the three hundred fine bowls and more than two thousand small jars I have saved, and even sell my wife's bags of clothes and jewelry to invest in the business and work hard." Immediately after, Manager Dai Haoran also said: "I also have more than two thousand small jars and two hundred fine bowls. I will also take them out today to invest in the business."

After several days of meetings, mobilization, and discussions, the county trade union convened a labor-capital symposium of thirty or forty people. Everyone explained the crisis of the ceramic industry, as well as the attitude of workers and kiln owners towards the resumption of work, and made mutual self-criticisms. The kiln owners unanimously stated that they must work hard in the future, prepare more raw materials, reduce shop employee, fireman, and all miscellaneous expenses, and be willing to take out the inventory at home to invest in the business and never waste it. They also set a plan to strive for each kiln to produce seven kilns of goods this year. The trade union also firmly stated on behalf of the workers that it would ensure labor-capital cooperation and mutual benefit for labor and capital in the future, implement a four-six profit-sharing system (workers 40%, kiln owners 60%), completely eliminate "small change" and other unreasonable demands outside the kiln so that the kiln owners can make money. Then, the labor and management signed a contract and established a ceramic industry management committee to ensure that everyone would discuss and handle matters together and gradually prosper the ceramic industry.

Since the resumption of work, everyone has been clamoring that this resumption of work and reform of the system are unprecedented. (Ma Shizhong)

　　劳资双方密切合作  彭城磁业走向繁荣
    华北著名磁业产地的彭城，在民国二十六年，瓷业极繁荣时期，曾有缸碗窑二百座，工人四千余名，当时交通便利，曾销行东北、平、津各地，因而各地瓷商来往络绎不绝，故有“千里彭城”与“日入斗金”之称。
    瓷工除本地人外，有安阳人和山西人，他们绝大部分家中都无房无地，从小时就来到窑上学徒，学徒时间短的四、五年，长的七、八年，才能学成一个技术工人。六十几个窑主中，即有五十几个地主兼窑主，窑主兼营土地最多者有三、四百亩，一般者五、六十亩，最少者二十亩。
    民国二十六年冬天，敌伪侵占彭城，瓷业遭到极大摧残破坏，当时除少数大窑主与敌伪勾结继续经营外，一般中小窑主，因资本困难，或勉强支持门面，或因敌伪压迫而歇业。前年八月彭城解放后，政府即拨粮四千斤，贷款十五万元。进行扶持救济，以便复工，不久即有缸碗窑四十四座开工，工人一千余名复业。同时，工会即领导工人开始向特务汉奸恶霸等进行诉苦复仇清偿血债等斗争。这样，遂引起少数大窑主的恐慌不安，因而对生产采取消极观望态度。
    去年八月大部瓷工都参加了彻底消灭封建地主兼大窑主的运动。而一般中小窑主表示畏惧怀疑。虽再三解释，但他们总是不大相信；再加之资本经常不足，销路仍停滞不前，原料高贵及其他原因，遂造成瓷业发展道路上的危机。
    今年一月工会检讨出去年因着重解决土地问题，有时对工人方面工作照顾不够，即抽出干部二人深入各窑专门调查复工及其有关问题。调查结果，七十余座缸碗窑中，只有卅五座碗窑能复工，其余三十座，因窑主正在清算与原料不足，暂不能复工。接着工会即召开了一百二十余人的干部积极分子及小组长会议，研究发动生产及复工问题。轮工胡万艮说：“去年窑主怕斗争，没负到责任，没预备原料。”旋工马玉荣说：“去年三次增资、借资，影响今年复工。”工匠张克顺说：“去年工会就提倡劳资合作，劳资两利，但去年大家三次增资，人家赔钱咱有利，可是窑主赔钱就不能干，人家不干咱就失业；咱赚的少，顾不住生活也不干；谁没利谁也不干。叫我说咱们赚多不如赚少，赚少人家有利，咱才不失业才有钱赚。”轮工牛玉清说：“他赔钱咱知道？作买卖赔赚都有，那光许赚不许赔。敌人在时，他赚的钱都那里去了？”托工张山说：“咱们别那样说了，光检讨人家窑主，不检讨自己。咱去年一个人有借五、六千元的，有借八、九千元一万的，可光借没还呀，咱们增资，还给人家要这个酒钱，那样“零碎”，叫我说，咱把过去遗留下不合理的东西都去掉，现在咱赚工资也不少，一天多的赚一千三、四百元，少的赚五、六百元，这不算少赚，就是少赚，可是有房住有地种了，就咱二年做工赚的钱，也买不了这些房和地。”轮工索明山说：“窑主靠公家的钱互助合作了，变成职员，咱增资他们也增资，去年窑上下大雨，淋坏了碗坯子，他也不管，点着火也不去看大小，整天喝茶水吸洋烟，又吃面条，就没有说说浪费。光检讨咱就没有说说这个。”轮工郭顺清说：“咱们不管怎检讨，也是窑主赔钱。有人说不赔钱，咱们给人家算算账，到底看看赔钱不赔钱，如果窑主真赔钱，咱们不但要去掉过去遗留下的各种各样的酒钱与“零碎”，还得减低工资。”经过这样一场热烈的讨论，大家对如何复工及劳资两利才能劳动生产较以前有了清楚的认识。因此，大家都说：郭顺清的话说的对。于是即开始了算账。
    算账的结果，一座碗窑原料与柜上职员工资及一切公杂开支共一百零五万元，各部门工人工资共六十七万元，以上两项开支总共一百七十余万元；而一窑货值价一百五十万元，这样计算，大家认为公平，但仍赔廿余万元，这时工人马玉荣说：“人家赔钱怎么办？”大伙儿都说：“人家赔钱，大家伙就跌工资，那光许涨不许跌？水涨船高，水落船低，跌工资不丢人。”画工要美赶着说：“咱跌工资该跌多少？”张克春说：“跌三成，赚至一千元，这才叫人家不赔钱。”结果大家都举手赞成。
    为了深入了解窑主的要求与困难，着干部两人去工商瓷庄作个别访问复工等问题，经理戴浩然说：“今年复工真困难，流动资本少，买不下原料，八座窑只能复工六座，到五月还得停工。去年有五、六百万元资本，除柜上一切开支与工人工资开支外，工人还暂借去一百八十万元，这样一来就没多少余钱了。再给银行借五、六十万元，也不能干多久。”职员韩世有说：“去年料原贵，三次增资、借资有困难是真的，叫我说，应检讨自己，大家都没负到责任，窑上下雨淋坏了碗坯子没人管，这也怨工人吗？”职员纪福山也抢着说：“要检讨就着重检讨自己，叫我说，去年春天原料和炭都很贱，那时公家几次投资，不买原料和煤炭，钱也没了。后半年货贵了，没原料那能赚钱。工人增资，，咱们也增资，那有不赔钱。”窑主张树林说：“说实话，去年真怕斗争了咱。我家五十多亩地叫群众清算了，就给公家合作闹窑，混点吃喝就算了，今年明白了政府保护工商业是真的，就不害怕了，我愿意拿出存下的三百纣细碗和二千多小缸子，再卖女人的几包衣服、首饰都入了股，努力干。紧接着经理戴浩然也说：“我也有两千多小缸子，和二百多纣细碗，今天也拿出来入了股。”
    经过几天的开会动员讨论，县工会遂召开了三、四十人的劳资座谈会，大家说明了瓷业的危机、及工人和窑主对复工的态度，并互相作了检讨。各窑主一致表示：今后一定要好好干，多准备原料，减少柜上职员、火夫及一切公杂开支，并愿将家里存货都拿出来入了股，绝不浪费干下去。并订计划争取今年一座窑出七窑货，工会亦代表工人坚决表示了：保证今后劳资合作、劳资两利，按四六分红制（工人四成窑主六成），彻底去掉“零碎”及其他窑外不合理的要求，使窑主能赚钱。接着劳资双方就订立了合同，并成立瓷业管理委员会，保证有事大家商量处理，把瓷业逐渐繁荣起来。
    自复工后，大家都嚷着说：这个复工与改革制度是空前未有的。（马世忠）
