　　Expose the Landlords' Parasitic Ideology
　　Returning home from the Fourth District of Licheng, I encountered a landlord named Wang Laishan in Mugua Village, First District. He had his grandson carry a bag to beg for grain from the newly emancipated households. He spoke very rudely, saying he could get three or four dou of grain a day. I believe that the landlords' parasitic ideology of not working and still wanting to exploit others has not been eliminated. Like Wang Laishan, he is capable of working but refuses to do so. If there are similar phenomena in various places, I suggest that these people should be organized into production to let them experience labor and change their parasitic and exploitative ideological consciousness.

　　揭破地主的寄生思想
    我由黎城四区回家，到一区木瓜村遇着一个地主，叫王来善，引了他的孙子背了个口袋，向新翻身户要粮食吃。说话还非常粗气，他说一天能要三四斗粮食。我认为地主不劳动还想剥削人是寄生思想还未清除。像王来善还很能劳动而是不肯劳动。各地如有同样现象，我建议应把这些人组织到生产中去，让他体验劳动，改变他的寄生剥削思想意识。
