　　The Border Region Literary Association Rewards "Wang Keqin Class" Play

　　Because the opera *Wang Keqin Class* has been warmly welcomed at the front, the Border Region Literary Association is awarding a bonus of 10,000 yuan and sending a letter of tribute to the Military Region Art Troupe and the Sixth Column Art Team. The original letter is as follows:

　　To all comrades of the Military Region Art Troupe and the Sixth Column Art Team!

　　In your efforts on the front lines, you went into the troops to learn, and created the new opera *Wang Keqin Class*, vividly praising the new heroes of the masses, achieving great success! Hearing this news makes us feel immense excitement and joy! In addition to commissioning many comrades in the Literary and Art Communications to write articles introducing it, the Literary Association is specially awarding a creation bonus of 10,000 yuan to *Wang Keqin Class* to express our sincere respect! We also hope that all comrades will quickly create more and better plays in the meritorious service movement to reflect the great patriotic self-defense war!

　　With warm regards!
