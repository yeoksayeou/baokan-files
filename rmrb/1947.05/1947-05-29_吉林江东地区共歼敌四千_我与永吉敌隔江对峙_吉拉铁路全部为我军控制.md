Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 27th: The Headquarters of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army has recently issued the Third Communiqué of the Summer Offensive, announcing the details and results of the battle on the outskirts of Jilin, stating: A part of our army advanced towards the outskirts of Jilin starting on May 11th. The Chiang-Du troops in that area relied on the Changbai Mountains, which had been fortified for years with steel and concrete works, and strengthened their defenses by incorporating puppet bandits, forming a cone-shaped zone wedged into our Eastern Manchurian Liberated Area. Within the two days of the 11th and 12th, our army, with sweeping force, successively eliminated strongholds such as Youjiatun, Tiangang, Jiangmifeng, and Qipan Street, first annihilating the entire 7th Security Regiment of the enemy, and advanced towards the city of Jilin. Another part pointed east towards the perilous Laoye Ridge, 910 meters above sea level. The Chiang-Du troops, on the 16th, hastily used a regiment of troops to attack our positions at Paoziyuan and Xiaolazishan from Jilin, firing over a thousand shells, but our army bravely repelled them. On the same day, our army annihilated most of the 6th Security Regiment of the enemy at Sanjiazi, east of Jilin, and the spearhead of the offensive pointed towards the world-famous Xiaofengman Power Plant. The enemy was forced to transfer a part of the 182nd Division of the 60th Army from the weak Hailong area to reinforce, and huddled within the fortifications, daring not to come out to fight. Under the might of our army, the 114th Regiment of the 38th Division of the New First Army in Wulajie, on the 18th, attempted to escape into Jilin City under cover of night. The 112th Regiment of the 38th Division of the New First Army, isolated and without reinforcements on Laoye Ridge, also hurriedly abandoned their clothing and supplies at dusk on the 20th and fled south in a panic. As soon as they scurried into the deep mountains and forests, they were tracked down and attacked by our army, and they dashed about like stray dogs, and were finally annihilated completely within Taiping Mountain, south of Laoye Ridge, on the evening of the 21st. At this point, the battle came to an end. Our army completely controls the La (Fa) Ji (Lin) line. The vast area northeast of the Laji line, east of Jilin, except for a small number of enemy troops still at Longtanshan and Xiaoqiaotou in Xiaofengman, has been liberated again. The iron factory, chemical factory, and synthetic oil plant in the vicinity of Jilin have all been occupied by our army, and Jilin across the river is now under our army's overlooking gaze. According to preliminary statistics from this campaign: nearly a thousand officers and soldiers, including Zhang Jieyuan, the commander of the 112th Regiment of the 28th Division of the New First Army, Lieutenant Colonel Liu Yixin, the deputy commander, and Wang Deguang, the lieutenant colonel battalion commander of the 7th Security Regiment, were killed or wounded; over two thousand seven hundred officers and soldiers, including Fan Zengshou, the colonel battalion commander of the 112th Regiment, Zhang Lianxi, the colonel commander of the 7th Security Regiment, Yin Songlin, the deputy commander, and Wang Chengkai, the battalion commander of the 19th Security Regiment, were captured. Over ten mortars, over twenty 60mm mortars, five rocket launchers, five American-made mountain guns, two anti-tank guns, over one thousand six hundred and forty rifles and carbines, over one hundred and thirty light and heavy machine guns, one anti-aircraft machine gun, one hundred and seventy submachine guns, over four hundred and forty thousand rounds of ammunition of various types, over five thousand artillery shells, five radio stations, five telephones, and many other military supplies were seized.
