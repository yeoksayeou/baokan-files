　　Jiaozuo Third District Cooperates with Military Victory
    Launches New District Propaganda Offensive
    [This newspaper's Jiaozuo dispatch] In April, cadres and militiamen of the Third District, in conjunction with the victorious military offensive, launched a propaganda offensive in the 33 newly liberated and reached villages to expose the enemy's deception, publicize our policies, and spread news of our army's victories, with great results. Every time the enemy arrived at a village, they cut down all the trees in the village to build blockhouses, make barricades, or use them for firewood, but stubbornly wrote large-character slogans like "Protect the Forests" on the walls of the streets. We publicized to the masses, using the stumps of trees chopped down by the Chiang army to contrast with the Chiang army's slogans, and its conspiracy to deceive people was exposed without needing to be pierced. Shi Ziyu, the deputy commander of the puppet Fourth Special District People's Self-Defense Force, led his remnants of more than 500 men and entrenched themselves in Xiyu Village and En Village in the Third District, deceiving and inducing our cadres and militiamen, saying things like "The militiamen can come back, we guarantee nothing will happen..." etc., but during the night they pushed the sister-in-law of our cadre and militiaman Zhang Qinggui, the grandmother of Zhang Hanlian, and Zhang Mao's mother alive into the well and drowned them. At first, the masses were still numb, thinking that Shi Ziyu was okay, and the bad ones were the henchmen he led. After we publicized the facts, the masses' eyes were opened, and they realized that the big special agent Shi Ziyu was "a sore on the top of his head, pus flowing from the bottom of his feet, bad from head to toe." Publicizing our victory news to the masses in the enemy-occupied areas and guerrilla areas is the most important task to encourage the masses. Experience has proven that propagating through the masses to the masses again is very effective in terms of method. This time, the Henan-North battle opened the prelude, the fire of victory and excitement burned in the hearts of the masses, and they publicized it everywhere. The hearts of the special agents and local bullies had long been cold and trembling, like a frozen piece of icicle.

　　焦作三区配合军事胜利
    展开新区宣传攻势
    【本报焦作讯】三区干部民兵，四月里结合着胜利的军事攻势，在新解放的和所到的三十三个村庄里，展开宣传攻势，以揭穿敌人的欺骗，宣传我们的政策，传播我军胜利消息，收效很大。敌人每到一村，即把村里的树砍光了，用来盖炮楼，做鹿砦或烧火用，但硬要在大街的墙上涂写着“保护森林”的大字标语。我们向群众宣传，用蒋军砍了的树屁股和蒋军的标语对照事实，它这张阴谋欺骗人的嘴巴，不揭自穿。伪四专署人民自卫纵队副司令时子玉，率其残部五百多人，盘踞于三区西于村、恩村一带，欺骗诱降我干部民兵，说什么“民兵回来，保证没事，……”等，白天说这话黑夜就把我干部民兵家属张清贵的嫂、张汉敛奶奶、张毛他娘活活推到的井里淹死了。起初群众还麻痹，认为时子玉还可以，坏的是他领的喽罗们，在我们用事实宣传后，群众的眼睛擦亮了，认识了时子玉大特务是“头顶上生疮，脚底下流浓，从头坏到底了。”向敌占区、游击区群众宣传我们的胜利消息，是鼓舞群众最重要的一项。经验证明：通过群众再向群众宣传，在方式上收效很大。这次豫北大战揭开了序幕，群众心里燃烧起胜利兴奋的烈火，到处都宣传，特务恶霸的心早冷得打战，像冻结了的一块冰凌。
