[Reported by this newspaper] With planting entering a critical stage, Party, government, and military organs throughout the region are actively responding to the Party's call and universally assisting in plowing. All units directly under the Jinnan Military Region have mobilized to help villagers in their stationed areas with production. Even convalescing and disabled comrades, as well as those recovering from injuries and illnesses, are actively participating. All personnel of the Political Department are performing three days of voluntary labor per person to help the masses rush to plant cotton. The battalion headquarters and the 1st artillery company have helped plow 74 mu of land and delivered more than 380 cartloads of fertilizer. They have also carried more than 1,600 loads of water for poor farmers without labor. The Health Department of the Second Sub-district of Taihang, led personally by Political Commissar Li and the department head, is assisting with spring plowing. They proposed three "don'ts" (don't ask for any compensation, don't damage villagers' furniture, don't eat villagers' food) and delivered more than 1,200 loads of fertilizer and dug more than 2,600 steps of field edges in five days. While engaged in production, they also promoted news of victories on the front lines and the importance of large-scale production. Under the call and leadership of County Secretary Jia and County Head Wang, government organs in Huguan helped the masses with 97 workdays, planted 70 mu of miscellaneous crops, and delivered 800 loads of fertilizer. Their enthusiasm for production influenced and encouraged the masses. Town head Ping Hai-shui immediately called on the whole town to finish planting for military families within three days, putting forward the slogan: "Soldiers shed blood for us, we shed sweat for the soldiers," sparking a surge in rush planting. Seeing that the local masses were joining the war effort and spring plowing was pressing, the direct organs of the 55th Division of the 38th Army of the Northwest Democratic Allied Army launched an aid-in-plowing campaign. Division Commander Yang, despite being ill, personally mobilized the troops. Except for a few who insisted on staying at work, more than 40 people were mobilized. Everyone was extremely enthusiastic. Some had blisters and bled on their hands but did not stop. They said, "We are now the people's army, we must be hard-working and serve the people." They helped 58 military families, martyrs’ families, and families of participants in the war effort, plowing 290 mu of land and digging 9 and a half mu of bean fields. Thirteen production models such as Zhang Shucheng and Tian Hongyu emerged. The aid-in-plowing surge among all personnel of the Military and Political University continues to increase. In addition to manual labor, livestock from various units are also being used to help with plowing. The principal even had his own riding animal help villagers plow the land. According to incomplete statistics from three brigades, a total of 121 military families, martyrs’ families, cadre families and poor people without labor were helped, plowing more than 190 mu of land and delivering more than 300 carts of fertilizer, including more than 100 carts pulled by people. Cadre and miscellaneous personnel from the First Station of the Military Region Office all went out to help with plowing, planting more than 40 mu of land in two days. Comrade Chen Dingfa, having just returned from a trip, helped villagers pull the seed drill despite his fatigue, planting 10 mu of millet in one afternoon.

[Reported by this newspaper] In response to the call to rush to plant, prevent drought, and prepare for famine, starting on the 24th, all typesetting sections of this newspaper's printing plant, except for a few who were physically weaker and a few female comrades who insisted on staying at work, helped villagers in their stationed areas carry water and plant cotton. On a mile-long path uphill, each comrade could carry ten or so loads in half a day, their shoulders becoming red and swollen, and sweat pouring down their backs, but everyone showed a cheerful expression on their faces, making contributions for the people and fully demonstrating their initiative. According to one day's statistics, more than 12 mu of cotton have been planted. Comrade Shao Dazhang of the proofreading section said: "It hurts a little, but serving the masses makes me happy, and swelling is just a good form of exercise." The village has planted more than 80 mu from the 17th to the 24th.
