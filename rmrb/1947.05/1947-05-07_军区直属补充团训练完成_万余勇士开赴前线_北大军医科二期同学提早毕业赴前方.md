　　Military Region Directly Subordinate Supplementary Regiment Completes Training
    Over Ten Thousand Warriors March to the Front Lines
    Peking University Military Medical Department Second Term Students Graduate Early to Go to the Front

    [This newspaper's Yu Bei Frontline, 5th dispatch] Over ten thousand new soldiers from the Taihang region in the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region Directly Subordinate Supplementary Regiment, after appropriate short-term study, set off for the front lines on the 29th. During the study period, each regiment first conducted political study to raise class consciousness. Before departing for the front, they held technical competitions and combat exercises. Their grenade throwing scores were all above 30 meters, with the furthest reaching 52 meters. Their shooting all hit the target, and their bayonet skills, construction work, and various combat actions were all extremely proficient. The marching speed was 38 li in 2 hours and 50 minutes. After the recent great victories in northern Shaanxi, Jin-Cha-Ji, and northern Henan, the new soldiers in each regiment successively requested to go to the front lines as soon as possible. When departing on the 29th, the villagers and militiamen stationed in the villages and along the way brought cigarettes and tea, cheering and seeing them off. Some of the new soldiers' family members, while seeing them off, exhorted, "Do a good job at the front, and only by defeating old Jiang can we protect our land." After the new soldiers in each regiment arrived at the front, General Liu Bocheng personally gave a speech to welcome them (for excerpts of the speech, see another telegram). The new soldiers shouted slogans such as "We want to defend the land for ourselves," "We demand independence, democracy, and freedom," and "Under the leadership of Commander Liu, we will resolutely fight to the end and defeat Chiang Kai-shek," marching to the front lines in the fading twilight.

    [This newspaper's special dispatch] The entire body of new soldiers in the Military Region Supplementary Third Regiment, after only a short month of study, has transformed from ordinary civilians into People's Liberation Army fighters with proficient military skills. During the training, many training heroes emerged. On April 26th, the entire regiment held a grand competition and drill to inspect the results, displaying the brilliant achievements they had obtained through hard training. The average grenade throwing distance (one jin and two liang iron grenade) for the entire regiment was 28.2 meters, with the average for the Sixth Company being 29.94 meters. There were 112 individuals with scores above 35 meters, with Comrade Li Shengcai achieving the highest record of 48.8 meters for the entire regiment. Secondly, there were 98 individuals above 35 meters, and 15 individuals above 40 meters. Various prizes were awarded according to the scores. After the awards were given, Political Commissar Liang of the regiment encouraged everyone to become enemy-killing heroes in future battles. After the meeting, each company made a review, and felt that they had not learned enough and still had to go to the front to learn. The Second Company took the lead in writing a letter to the regimental leaders requesting permission to go to the front, followed by a flurry of challenge letters, response letters, and requests. The Ninth Company wrote in a letter: "Although the skills we have learned are not very good, we are able to top ten of Chiang Kai-shek's soldiers. We hope to go to the front quickly." In the discussion meeting of the Sixth Company of the Second Battalion, everyone rushed to speak. More than 70 people made spontaneous oaths on the spot, determined to strive to become enemy-killing heroes. Squad Deputy Jiang Bingchen and Platoon Deputy Zhang Genwei (both promoted from new soldiers) proposed to guarantee that the entire platoon would not desert, would not fall behind in the march, would abide by mass discipline, and would strive to become combat heroes in battle. At the unanimous request of the soldiers in each company, a general assembly of soldiers of the entire regiment was convened again on the afternoon of the 28th, and the regimental leaders approved their request to go to the front.

    [This newspaper's special dispatch] Over forty students in the second term of the Peking University Military Medical Department were originally scheduled to graduate in July of this year, but in order to strengthen the front lines, they graduated early on April 17th and went to the front lines on the 20th. When they heard Deputy Minister He of the Ministry of Health talk about the situation of the soldiers fighting at the front, their blood boiled, and they resolutely accepted the task and went to the front. Comrade Zhao De said with indignation: "Now is the time for us to render meritorious service to the people. I must fight the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries to the death!" Comrade Zhai Qihai, who came from the Democratic National Construction Army, said sadly: "Fortunately, the Democratic National Construction Army revolted, otherwise, I might have become cannon fodder. I must go to the front and settle the old scores with the reactionaries!" Under their influence, the students of the Second and Third Detachments also requested to go to the front together to render meritorious service to the people. On April 18th, during the graduation ceremony, Principal Fan earnestly instructed the second term students of the medical college to serve the people's soldiers wholeheartedly on the front lines in order to accelerate the defeat of Chiang Kai-shek, and hoped that everyone would turn what Deputy Minister He said about "the cultivation of people's doctors and the style of medical treatment" into practical action. The students staying at the school are determined to intensify their studies and practice their skills at the school, striving to be able to go to the front quickly and render meritorious service to the people.

    【本报特讯】军区补充第三团全体新战士，经过了短短的一个月学习时间，已由一个普通老百姓变成了一个具有熟练的军事技术的人民解放战士。在练兵中，涌现出不少的练兵英雄。四月二十六日，全团特举行了检阅成绩的大比赛会操，显示了他们由苦练得来的光辉成绩。投弹（一斤一两重的铁弹）全团平均为二八·二米，六连平均二九·九四米，个人成绩在三五米以上的即有一百一十二人，以李生才同志投四八·八米为全团最高纪录。其次，在三五米以上的有九十八名，四○米以上的十五名。均按成绩发给各种奖品。在发奖后，该团梁政委勉励大家将来在战斗中当一个杀敌英雄。会后各连都作了检讨，而且觉得还学的不够，还得去到前方去学。二连首先向团首长写信请求准许他们到前方，接着各种挑战书、应战书、请求信，雪片飞来。九连来信说：“我们现在学的本领虽还不很好，但比起蒋介石的兵来，能够一个顶他十个，我们希望很快的到前方去。”二营六连在讨论会上都争先恐后的发言，当场七十余人自动宣誓，决心争取当杀敌英雄。一排副江丙辰同志、二排副张根维同志（均是新战士提拔的）提出保证全排不开一个小差，在行军中不掉队，遵守群众纪律，在战斗中争取当战斗英雄。在各连战士的一致要求下，又在二十八日下午召开了全团军人大会，团首长批准了他们上前线的要求。
    【本报特讯】北大军医科二期同学四十余人，按原订教育计划应于今年七月毕业，可是为了增强前线力量，他们提前于四月十七日毕业，二十日即走上前线。当他们听到卫生部何副部长谈到前线将士作战的情形时，他们的热血沸腾了，毅然的接受任务走上前线。赵德同志激愤的说：“现在是我们为人民立功的时候了，我非和蒋介石反动派死拚不可！”从民主建国军来的翟齐海同志悲痛的说：“幸而民建军起义了，否则，我也许已变成炮灰；我一定要到前线去，和反动派们算算老账！”在他们的影响下，二三区队的同学们也要求一齐到前线去，为人民立功。四月十八日举行毕业典礼时，范校长谆谆嘱咐医学院第二期同学在前线一定要全心全意为人民战士服务，以加速打败蒋介石，并希望大家把何副部长说的“人民医生的修养及医病作风问题”变成实际行动。留校的同学们则决心在校内加紧学习，练好本事，争取迅速能上前线，为人民立功。
