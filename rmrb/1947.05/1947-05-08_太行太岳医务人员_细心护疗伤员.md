(Taihang News) Xiao Zhanguo, director of the Second Institute of the First District Hospital, and doctor Cao Shuwen, transfused their own blood to seriously wounded soldiers. Director Xiao visited the ward several times a day for follow-up consultations, and Doctor Cao gave night classes to the nurses, implementing new treatments. All the medical staff in the institute worked hard to prevent 100% of the wounded from developing pus, and now they have achieved 91.2% without inflammation or suppuration. After twenty days of treatment, 27% of the wounded have been discharged from the hospital and returned to their units. The nurses took exceptional care of the sick and wounded. The Third Ward collectively composed a clapper ballad praising nurses Lin Zengde and others, and wrote a letter to Doctor Cao saying: "We are extremely grateful for the care given to us by comrades Hou Wangshan, Fan Yuqin, Li Zhaoxiang, Lin Zengde, Lin Xinjiang, Lei Tongsheng, Chen Zhong, and Wen Haiquan...." The Second Ward also spontaneously offered慰劳 to the nurses. (Xin En, Zhanguo, Feng Ju)

(Taiyue News, 6th) The Taiyue Military Region's front and rear hospitals and health clinics have uniformly launched a campaign to perform meritorious service for the people. The Health Field Fourth Institute put forward the slogan of caring for convalescents during the New Treatment Method Blitz Month in February and March. Comrade Wang Yu, the political instructor, led all the staff to personally build the hospital, saving more than 500 civilian labor days. At the Convalescent Home of the Second Sub-district, thanks to the dedicated research of Doctor Guo and medical assistant He, they created a variety of new treatment methods, resulting in significant achievements in treatment. More than 60 wounded soldiers were discharged from the hospital in one month, more than double the previous number, and even long-term unhealed gunshot wounds and blast injuries have been cured. Medical assistant He also used his accumulated allowance of 1,000 yuan to provide scabies patients with baths, and visited the wards three or four times a day to check for changes in their conditions. At the end-of-month summary, Doctor Guo and medical assistant He were both selected as model military doctors. All the staff of the First Mobile Institute of the Department of Health conducted ideological reviews and established plans for meritorious service. When they set off for the Jinan front line, in addition to carrying their own luggage, they helped each other carry public supplies during the march, and their morale was high, without any complaints. Old cooks Hei Zhansheng and Jing Fuqi, who were over forty years old, carried cages and supplies like young people. Quartermaster Guo Laifu carried 40 catties of public oil and 15 catties of vermicelli. Nursing platoon members Ma Dengshan, Xia Wangxiao, Li Heiyin, Li Guangxi, and Liu Yongcheng were all young comrades, but they were unwilling to fall behind during the march. Each person carried their own luggage, as well as a quilt for the wounded and disinfection equipment for the surgery room. In the past, the Second Mobile Institute completely relied on the masses to transport grain, but since the launch of the meritorious service campaign, cadres have personally taken the lead in carrying 2,740 catties of grain and chopping 11,800 catties of firewood, saving 121 civilian labor days in two instances.

(Yushe News) In order to ensure the health of the 60,000 people of Yushe County and launch a large-scale production movement, a conference of all existing doctors in the county and doctors willing to serve in the medical field was held on the 11th of this month, combined with an assessment. A total of four days, with 82 people attending, reported on the progress of health work over the past year and exchanged experiences. For example, Dr. He Yushou, a model doctor in the Third District, organized forces to intensively treat the people of Pingwangjiagou and Nancun villages when the plague and dysentery were prevalent in the spring and summer of last year. Before going there, more than a dozen people died within five days. After intensive treatment, most of them recovered. During the Baijin Campaign last spring, He Yushou and more than ten others established a first aid station in Yuncun, specifically responsible for treating passing civilian laborers and militiamen participating in the war. After political and technical tests and group assessments, 53 doctors, 14 medical assistants, and 12 interns were qualified. Everyone unanimously recognized that to be a doctor, one must be able to serve the masses, and to promote their expertise. After the meeting, everyone's experiences were compiled into a book, distributed to various villages, and a county and district medical research team was established, proposing the call to complete ten apprentices this year, to balance drug prices, and to reduce drug prices for military cadres and their families by 5%, and to ensure responsibility for one to two villages per day, and to regularly supervise and inspect health treatment work.
