Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 26th: A frontline reporter recently met with Pi XuanYou, Major General and Deputy Brigade Commander of the 51st Brigade of the Chiang Army's 74th Division, who was captured at Menglianggu. He was dressed in American-style soldier's clothing, his round face filled with fatigue. When discussing the recent battle, Pi stated that the People's Liberation Army's rapid movements were "unexpected." He said, "In the two days before contact, we (referring to the Chiang army) determined that there were no main forces of your army (referring to the People's Liberation Army) in that mountainous area (referring to the Yimeng Mountains). It wasn't until the 14th that we discovered we were surrounded by your army, and we hurriedly withdrew the troops attacking Anti (located north of Menglianggu). Unexpectedly, WanQuan Mountain (located south of Menglianggu) had already been captured by your army on the evening of the 14th, completely cutting off our retreat. At the time, although we felt there was a danger of being annihilated, we always believed that the fighting strength of our division (referring to Chiang's 74th Division) was sufficient to hold firm relying on the terrain, waiting for reinforcements from the east and west. However, we did not expect that the officers and soldiers of your army would be so formidable and the firepower so intense. When your army launched a general offensive on Lushan on the 16th, the officers and soldiers of our division scurried around, unable to deploy any firepower at all." He shook his head and said in a low voice, "If the soldiers are unwilling to fight, there is nothing the commander can do." Finally, Pi compared the complete annihilation of the 74th Division to "an iron pot smashed against a diamond drill bit," and said, "When encountering your army, any unit will be defeated."

Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 26th: Chen Xuyun, Brigade Commander of the 57th Brigade of the Chiang Army's 74th Division, was captured during the Menglianggu Campaign and sent to a unit of the East China People's Liberation Army. Liu Shikun, a cook in that unit and former soldier of the Chiang Army's 74th Division, happened to be watching nearby. The soldiers joked with him, saying, "Liu Shikun has run into his old superior." Chen Xuyun heard this and asked Liu, "Which unit were you in?" Liu said angrily, "Which unit? The East China People's Liberation Army. I used to be a soldier in the 1st Battalion of the 170th Regiment of your 57th Brigade. Don't you remember? Last year, when we were fighting at Lianshui, one of our battalions crossed the (Yu Huang) River, and you ordered the pontoon bridge to be dismantled, caring only about saving your own life." Liu coldly smiled, turned around, and walked away, saying loudly, "Good, you've come too. You couldn't escape after all." Chen lay silently on the stretcher.

　　“生铁碰上金钢钻”
  　皮宣猷谈七十四师覆灭
    【新华社华东前线二十六日电】前线记者于日前会见了孟良崮就俘之蒋军七十四师五十一旅少将副旅长皮宣猷。渠身穿美式士兵服装，肥圆脸上挂满疲惫之色。谈及此次战斗时，皮氏对解放军行动神速感到“出乎意料”。并谓：“在未接触前两天，我们（指蒋军）查明那一带山区（指沂蒙山区）没有贵军（指人民解放军）主力。及至十四日发觉遭受贵军包围，急忙把进攻岸堤（位孟良崮以北）的部队撤回，不料万泉山（位孟良崮以南）已于十四日晚被贵军攻占，退路完全堵死。当时，我们虽感到有被围歼之虞，但总认为本师（指蒋七十四师）的战斗力足以凭险坚守，以待东西援兵赶来。却不料贵军官兵如此厉害，火力如此炽烈。当十六日贵军向卢山总攻时，本师官兵东窜西跑，火力一点也展不开了。”他摇摇头低声说：“士不用命，指挥官是没有办法的。”最后皮氏将七十四师全军覆没比之为“生铁碰上金钢钻”；并谓：“碰上贵军，那个部队都要打败仗。”
    【新华社华东前线二十六日电】蒋军七十四师五十七旅旅长陈嘘云于孟良崮战役就俘，送抵华东人民解放军某部，该部炊事员原蒋军七十四师士兵刘世坤适在旁观看，战士们与他开玩笑地说：“刘世坤碰到老上司了。”陈嘘云听了问刘道：“你是那一部分的？”刘气愤地说：“那一部分的？华东人民解放军的，以前是你们五十七旅一七○团一营当兵的。不记得吗？去年打涟水，我们一个营过（淤黄）河，你下令拆掉浮桥，只管自己逃命。”刘冷笑着回头就走，一面大声说：“好，你也来了，到底逃不掉。”陈躺在担架上默默无言。
