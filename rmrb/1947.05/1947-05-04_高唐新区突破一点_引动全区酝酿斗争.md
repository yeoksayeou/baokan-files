[From Our Correspondent in Southern Hebei, 2nd] The new district of the seventh district of Gaotang was liberated not long ago, and the situation has been initially opened up. In Yinji, a large village of 400 households in the district, the Yin and Hao landlord families occupied four-tenths of the village's land, real estate, and property. After ten years of extortion by the enemy, puppet, and Chiang bandits, the most severely affected were the more than 100 tenant farmers and poor people, who completely lost their tenancy rights. After the landlords fled to Jinan, in order to evade the burden on the enemy, they gave the right to use the land to the puppet district chief. After Japan surrendered, it was transferred to Chiang bandit Deng Xiachen. The landlords sent a large number of lackeys to force the poor people living in the houses to move out, and a large number of farmers lost their homes. In February of this year, after the district was liberated by us, after more than a month of suppressing bandits and secret agents, propaganda, and uniting poor people's activists, on April 1st, a farmers' association of 150 people was organized, and their own leader, Zhang Bulun, was elected. The next day, they struggled against the pseudo-township head Yin Zhizeng who persecuted the peasants. This action seemed like a call to awaken the suffering peasants in the entire new district, and many villages began to brew struggle.

[From Our Correspondent in Southern Hebei, 2nd] Although the masses in Tianlou Village, Gaotang, had cleared out 960 mu of land from the hands of ten landlords, they did not touch the houses and furniture at all. Although the poor people had land, they still had to humbly borrow livestock and farm tools from the landlords. Therefore, during the great review of turning over, the masses proposed: "Struggling against them for a catty of cotton is also struggling, and struggling against them until they are completely submissive is also struggling. The landlords are still not convinced, so we have to struggle against them, and we must make them convinced." After brewing, on April 11th, more than 500 people conducted a second major reckoning with the landlords, and recovered more than 200 houses, more than 120 mu of land, ten livestock, fifteen carts, and hundreds of pieces of clothing, tables, chairs, boxes, and cabinets.

　　高唐新区突破一点
    引动全区酝酿斗争
    【本报冀南二日电】高唐七区新获解放不久，局面已初步打开，该区四百户的大村尹集，尹、郝二家地主，占全村土地、房产、财物的十分之四，经敌伪蒋匪十年的敲榨，受害最苦的是一百多户佃户、贫民，他们完全失去了佃权。地主逃到济南后，为着逃避对敌人的负担，就把土地的使用权送给伪区长。日本投降后，又转到蒋匪邓协臣手里。地主们派来大批狗腿，强逼住房的贫民搬走，大批农民失去住处。今年二月间，该区被我解放后，经过了月余的清剿特务，宣传酝酿，串连贫民积极分子；四月一日，组织起一百五十人的农会，选出了自己的领袖张不论，第二天就向迫害农民的伪乡长尹志增斗争，这个行动好像一声号令，唉醒了整个新区的受苦农民，好多村庄开始酝酿斗争。
    【本报冀南二日电】高唐田楼村群众虽从十家地主手中清算出九顷六十亩地，但对房子家具完全未动，穷人虽有了地，但牲口、农具仍得低声下气的去地主家借，所以在翻身大检查中，群众提出：“斗他们一斤棉花也是斗，斗他个服服贴贴也是斗，地主们现在还不服气，咱们还得斗，非叫他服气了不行”。经过酝酿，于四月十一日，五百余群众二次对地主进行大清算，又追出地主房屋二百余间，土地一百二十余亩，牲口十个，大车十五辆，衣服桌椅箱柜等数百件。
