　　People's Daily is the People's Newspaper
    Commemorating the First Anniversary of the People's Daily
    Teng Daiyuan
    The People's Daily is the newspaper of the people of Jinji-Luyu, and also the newspaper of the people's army of Jinji-Luyu. It is under the direct leadership of the Central Bureau of the CCP Jinji-Luyu. This is the position of the People's Daily, and it is very certain and very clear!
    The People's Daily has only one task: to reflect reality and serve the people. What is the current reality? The current reality is the great people's patriotic self-defense war; the people's elimination of feudal land reform; and the people's production and construction. One of the ways the Party leads is through the People's Daily to guide the people and their army to carry out the current battle. The Party educates the people and ideologically leads the people and their army to advance bravely. The Party also obtains rich experience and creations from the people and their army in practical actions through the newspaper, thereby guiding the people's struggle. We call this concentrating and persisting. This is the Party's policy towards the People's Daily, and it is also called the mass line.
    The People's Daily has been published for a year. Over the past year, the People's Daily has firmly stood its ground on this position and advanced along this path. It has increasingly become an indispensable part of the actual life of the people in the entire region. It encourages the people's struggle, sings the praises and commends the achievements and typical examples of the people, and it has become one of the important leadership methods of the Party. This is a major victory and it is worth celebrating! Although it has difficult aspects, those are technical difficulties that can be overcome.
    Further developing the leadership role of the People's Daily and helping it overcome practical difficulties is the common responsibility and obligation of the Party, government, military and people in the entire region. I think the first question is how to let our People's Daily universally penetrate into various regions, into villages and companies. Due to traffic difficulties, it is difficult to deliver newspapers to various remote areas in a timely manner. The only way is to effectively organize the manuscripts of the People's Daily into local newspapers. The second is to organize the people, especially cadres, to universally read and study the People's Daily. Communist Party members and commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army should unconditionally read and study the Party's organ newspaper and publicize the newspaper to the masses. Leading cadres at all levels should regularly check the implementation of this work. This is the responsibility and obligation of the leaders themselves. The third is to organize the broad masses to write for the People's Daily and regularly reflect the achievements and typical examples of the people's current struggle. It is also necessary to systematically expose the crimes of the reactionary enemy. This also requires leaders and leading organs to start and do it themselves. We should commend and learn the writing spirit of Battalion Commander Li Wenbo.
    Our newspaper is absolutely different from the newspapers of the bourgeoisie. We never pursue petty-bourgeois tastes, never pursue formalism and extravagance. Our newspaper is what it is. Our newspaper is under political leadership and full of vivid revolutionary spirit. Our newspaper is not run by the newspaper owner alone; it is jointly run by the Party and the people, and is a combination of the two. We should always abide by this characteristic, and our newspaper will always be loved by the people and will always be the people's newspaper.

　　人民日报是人民的报纸
    纪念人民日报一周年
    滕代远
    人民日报是晋冀鲁豫人民的报纸，也是晋冀鲁豫人民军队的报纸，它是在中共晋冀鲁豫中央局直接领导下的，这是人民日报的立场，这是肯定得很，明确得很的！
    人民日报只有一个任务：反映现实服务人民。什么是当前的现实？当前的现实就是伟大的人民爱国自卫战争；人民消灭封建的土地改革；人民的生产建设。党的领导方式之一即是通过人民日报来指导人民及其军队来进行现实的战斗，党教育人民，从思想上领导人民及其军队勇猛前进；党又从报纸获得人民及其军队在现实行动中的丰富经验和创造，从而又指导人民斗争，我们称其为集中起来坚持下去，这就是党对人民日报的政策，这也叫做群众路线。
    人民日报出版一周年了，这一年来人民日报是紧紧站稳这一立场，循着这条路线前进的，它已日益成为全区人民实际生活中不可缺少的东西了，它鼓舞人民斗争，歌颂和表扬人民的业迹和典型，它成为党的重要领导方式之一。这是一个重大的胜利，这是值得庆幸的！它虽有困难的一方面，但那是技术问题上的困难，是可以克服的困难。
    进一步发挥人民日报的领导作用和帮助其克服实际的困难，是全区党政军民共同的责任和义务。我觉得第一个问题是如何让我们的人民日报普遍深入各个区域，深入村庄和连队，由于交通困难，报纸及时传递至各个辽远的地区是困难的，唯一的办法是有效的将人民日报的稿件组织到各地方报纸上去；第二是组织人民，特别是干部普遍阅读和学习人民日报，共产党员，人民解放军的指战员阅读和学习党的机关报，并将报纸向群众宣传乃是无条件应该作到的。各级领导干部应经常检查这一工作的执行，这是领导者本身的责任和义务；第三是组织广大群众为人民日报写稿，经常反映人民当前斗争中的业迹和典型。也要有系统的暴露反动敌人的罪恶。这也要求领导者及领导机关，首先动手和亲自动手，我们应该表扬和学习营长李文波同志写作的精神。
    我们的报纸是和资产阶级的报纸绝对不同的，我们绝不追求小市民趣味，绝不追求形式和铺张，我们的就是我们的样子，我们的报纸是受政治领导，充满以生动的革命精神，我们的报纸不是报馆老板一人办的；是党和人民共同办的，是两者的结合体。我们应永远遵守这个特点，我们的报纸也就永远为人民所喜爱。永远是人民的报纸。
