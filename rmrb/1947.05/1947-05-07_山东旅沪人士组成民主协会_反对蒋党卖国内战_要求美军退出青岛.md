    Oppose Chiang Party's Selling Out the Country and Civil War, Demand US Troops Withdraw from Qingdao
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 30th] People from Shandong residing in Shanghai have formed the Shandong Democratic Association to oppose the Chiang Party's reliance on US imperialism to slaughter the people. According to the Ta Kung Pao, the association elected 23 executive committee members on February 26, with Zhang Xuemen and six others as standing committee members. They also issued a declaration at the inaugural meeting, stating: "If the civil war cannot be stopped immediately and effectively, the people of Shandong and the entire country will unite and organize to exert their own strength and refuse to pay taxes and levies." The declaration also stated: "The presence of US troops in China is a major pillar for those who launch the civil war. Therefore, US troops should immediately withdraw from China and return Qingdao to the people of Shandong. We will never allow imperialism to occupy it to support the Chinese civil war." Finally, it stated: "Democracy is the common belief of the people of the world and cannot be stopped by any force. The people of Shandong especially yearn for the early realization of democratic politics." It is noted that Mr. Zhang Xuemen is from Linqu County in this province, a former Qing Dynasty scholar. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he persisted in the anti-Japanese struggle in his hometown and was stabbed by the Japanese during an "anti-mopping up" operation.

    【新华社山东三十日电】本省旅沪人士组成山东民主协会，反对蒋党依靠美帝国主义屠杀人民。据大公报载，该会已于二月二十六日选出执委二十三人，以张雪门等七人为常委，并发表成立大会宣言称：“内战不能立即实际制止，山东乃至全国人民将团结组织起来，发挥自身力量，拒绝纳税、纳捐。”宣言并称：“美军驻在中国是发动内战者的绝大靠山，故美军应立刻退出中国去，归还山东人民的青岛，决不容许帝国主义窃踞来支持中国内战。”最后并称：“民主为世界人民的共同信仰，绝非任何力量所能阻止。我山东人民尤渴望民主政治早日实现。”按张雪门先生为本省临朐人，前清举人，抗战中曾在故乡一带坚持抗日斗争，反“扫荡”时曾被日人刺伤。
