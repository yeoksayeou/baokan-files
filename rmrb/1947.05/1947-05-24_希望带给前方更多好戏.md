　　Hoping to Bring More Good Shows to the Front
    (Letter Two)
    "...Recently, the drama activities at the front are going well. In addition to the troupes of various units, some troupes have come from the rear, often performing for various departments. The soldiers are very interested in watching plays. The ones that really play a role are "Blood and Tears of Hatred" and "The White-Haired Girl." These two plays have a great educational effect, and the effect is also very significant, especially for a large number of newly liberated soldiers. After almost every performance, many soldiers walk back crying. When I meet many leading comrades talking about the education of the troops, they say: "Quickly put on "Blood and Tears of Hatred" and "The White-Haired Girl"!"
    "I heard that the Peking University Literature Research Office may have a troupe coming here, which is very welcome. I hope to bring more good shows and more plays!" (Zhong)

　　希望带给前方更多好戏
    （来信之二）
    “……最近前方戏剧活动还好，除各部队的剧团以外，后方来了些剧团，经常到各部演出，战士们对于看戏是很感兴趣的。真的起作用的是《血泪仇》和《白毛女》，这两个戏的教育作用很大，效果也很大，尤其对大批刚解放过来的战士，差不多每场戏之后，很多战士都是哭着走回去。我碰见很多领导同志谈到部队的教育问题时，就说：“赶紧演一次《血泪仇》和《白毛女》！”
    “听说北大文研室可能有剧团来，这里很欢迎，希望带来更多的好戏和更多的戏！”（仲）
