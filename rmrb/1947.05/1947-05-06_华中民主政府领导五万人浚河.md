    Central China Democratic Government Leads 50,000 People in Dredging Rivers
    (Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 2nd) The democratic governments in the Jianghou Haimen and Qidong areas of Central China are leading more than 50,000 people to build dikes and dredge rivers to prevent floods and typhoons. The 1,400-zhang stone dike in the Lvsi district is planned to be widened by 1.5 zhang. The Xiangtang, Jiaopen, and Beikexing three embankments along the coast of Haimen own 20,000 mu of wasteland that can be reclaimed. In the past, it was controlled by feudal landlords. Now the government has decided to use the reeds on the fields as capital for dike construction and allocate another 10,000 mu to mobilize labor investment. It is stipulated that those who build dikes can get land, but no more than 40 mu per person. The remaining 10,000 mu will be distributed to demobilized soldiers after the victory of the self-defense war. The peasants, upon hearing the news, enthusiastically invested, and construction will begin soon. The four rivers of Beitong, Xinyang, Juyang, and Tongluogang in the eastern part of Haimen, which are sixty li long, started dredging in the late last month, which will save 200,000 people from floods. Although Chiang Kai-shek's planes often come to strafe, the peasants still insist on dredging.

    华中民主政府  领导五万人浚河
    【新华社华中二日电】华中蒋后海门、启东地区民主政府正领导五高余群众修堤浚河，防止水灾与风患。吕四区长一千四百丈之石堤准备增阔一丈五尺。海门沿海之巷堂、脚盆、北可兴三圩，拥有二万亩可开垦之荡田，过去为封建地主把持，现政府决定将田上芦柴作修堤资本，又拨一万亩动员劳动力投资。规定修堤者均可得田，但每人不超过四十亩。余一万亩留待自卫战胜利后分配给复员军人。农民闻讯，均踊跃投资，不日即可开工。海门东部之北通、新阳、聚阳、同罗港四河，长六十里，已于上月下旬开工疏浚，将使二十万人民免去水患。虽蒋机常来扫射，农民仍坚持修浚。
