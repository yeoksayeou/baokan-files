Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 19th: In the newly liberated areas of the counties surrounding Shijiazhuang, the peasant emancipation movement has been vigorously launched. Farmers are loudly proclaiming "Life for a life!" and "Reclaim the land!". Zhu Shirui and Xu Xiangzheng, the head of Wanmin Township, and Li Luoxiu and Jin Luofei, the deputy heads of the township in Zhengding District 1, have all been thoroughly reckoned with by the peasants. In Dongquancheng in District 2, after unanimous approval by the peasants, Pan Zhaoqing, the heinous former head of the "returning home" corps (a puppet organization), has been handed over to the government for execution, and all the property he looted has been fully compensated to the victimized masses. Wang Tongtang, a local tyrant in Suncun, north of the county, used to kill people without batting an eye. Only in the river flowing out of his township, there were more than forty corpses of victims. This time, the masses ignited the flames of revenge, and Wang Tongtang finally received the punishment of the people. The emancipation movement is now expanding to dozens of villages in the peripheral area of Anfeng. After fierce struggles, the masses in Wujiazhuang and four other villages overthrew eight major despots and bullies, including the big landlords Zhang Donghua, Yan Weijin, and Yan Datou, and the movement quickly spread throughout the second district of Zhengding and Gaocheng. While emancipating themselves, the peasants are also engaging in production and actively preparing for battle.

　　石庄外围各县农民严惩奸霸
    【新华社晋察冀十九日电】石庄外围新解放区各县，农民翻身运动已蓬勃展开。农民高呼“杀人偿命”与“收回土地”。正定一区完民庄大乡长朱士瑞、许香正，副大乡长李洛秀、靳洛飞等均已被农民彻底清算。二区东权城经农民一致通过，已将罪大恶极的伪还乡队长潘兆卿交政府处死刑，其抢掠的财物已全部赔偿了受害的群众。县北孙村恶霸王同堂，过去杀人不眨眼，仅在该大乡河中流出之被害死尸即有四十余具，此次群众燃起了复仇怒火，王同堂终于受到了人民的惩罚。现翻身运动已向边缘区安丰等数十村扩展。吴家庄等四村群众经激烈斗争打倒了大地主张洞华、阎惟谨、阎大头等八大恶霸，运动迅速遍及正藁二区。农民一面翻身，一面生产，并积极准备战斗。
