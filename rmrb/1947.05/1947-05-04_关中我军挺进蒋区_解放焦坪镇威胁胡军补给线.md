Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 2nd. A portion of the local armed forces of the Guanzhong Sub-district of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region advanced into the Chiang-occupied area. Following the liberation of Longfang Town in中部 (Central), they liberated Jiaoping, an important town 30 miles southwest of Yijun, on the 29th of last month. Most of the "Anti-Communist Self-Defense Force" and the police team were annihilated, and over a hundred people, including the company commander and the puppet town head, were killed. The notorious bandit Xia Yushan was also killed in this battle. Ninety-seven long and short guns were seized. The town is only ten miles or so from the Xian(yang)-Yan(an) highway. Together with Bafang Town, liberated on the 18th of last month, it was an important stronghold that the Chiang Hu army had operated for many years. The liberation of these strongholds has begun to expose the most important supply line for the Chiang Hu army invading northern Shaanxi to the People's Liberation Army.

　　关中我军挺进蒋区
    解放焦坪镇威胁胡军补给线
    【新华社西北二日电】陕甘宁边区关中分区地方武装一部挺进蒋占区，继解放中部之龙坊镇后，又于上月廿九日解放宜君西南卅里之重镇焦坪。歼“反共自卫队”、保警队大部、中队长、伪镇长以下百余人，惯匪夏玉山亦于是役被击毙。缴获长短枪九十七支。该镇距咸（阳）延（安）公路仅十余里左右，与上月十八日解放之罢访镇，同为蒋胡军经营多年之重要据点。这些据点之解放，使侵入陕北之蒋胡军后方最重要的补给线，开始暴露在人民解放军之前。
