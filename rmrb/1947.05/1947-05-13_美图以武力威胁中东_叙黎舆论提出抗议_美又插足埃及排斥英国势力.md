Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th. Comprehensive reports: U.S. imperialism is actively expanding, bragging and deceiving everywhere. Recently, it used its fleet to conduct exercises in the Eastern Mediterranean. At the end of last month, the U.S. fleet, including three cruisers, six destroyers, and the aircraft carrier "Leyte," sailed from the U.S. to the eastern Greek islands and conducted exercises in the Aegean Sea. On May 2nd, most of the fleet sailed to the Bosphorus Strait, while some cruisers "visited" Beirut in Lebanon and Latakia in Syria. Syrian and Lebanese newspapers have severely criticized and protested against this imperialist behavior. As-Siyasah stated: On the eve of the Syrian and Lebanese parliamentary elections, and while the United Nations Special Assembly is discussing the Arab demand for the independence of Palestine, the arrival of U.S. warships signifies the strategy of the gold standard imperialists to use force to threaten in order to achieve their goal of undermining the independence of Syria and Lebanon. However, this strategy will surely fail because the people of Syria and Lebanon highly cherish the independence they have won in their long anti-imperialist struggle. The Aleppo press declared its refusal to publish any news of U.S. naval activity.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th. Cairo dispatch: The Egyptian government has decided to reject the services of the British military advisory group. The government will notify Britain, demanding the dissolution of the four military advisory groups established under the 1936 treaty. In order to reorganize the Egyptian army, the government is planning to hire military experts from other countries, especially U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force military experts. Note: Previously, the United States had already signed an aviation agreement with Egypt, seizing Egypt's aviation rights. This decision by the Egyptian government shows that U.S. imperialism will further intervene in Egypt, and Anglo-American contradictions will inevitably become more acute.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th. Comprehensive news: The United Nations Special Assembly, discussing the Palestine issue, held general sessions on the 5th and 7th and passed motions allowing representatives of the Jewish Agency and the Palestine Higher Committee to present their views to the Political Committee. The Political Committee held continuous meetings from the 6th to the 8th, beginning to discuss the composition and scope of work of the Palestine Investigation Committee. The U.S. representative proposed organizing a "neutral" investigation committee, with Canada, Czechoslovakia, Iran, the Netherlands, Peru, Sweden, and Uruguay as the seven member states. Its power is extremely broad, allowing it to analyze and review various intelligence, convene anywhere at will, and listen to all appropriate assurances. The British representative echoed this view, while the Soviet Union and France, Colombia, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and others advocated that all or at least some of the five major powers—the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, France, and China—participate in the investigation committee. The Soviet representative also refuted the U.S. opinion, stating that a neutral investigation committee is politically impossible.

　　美图以武力威胁中东
    叙黎舆论提出抗议
    美又插足埃及排斥英国势力
    【新华社陕北十日电】综合报导：美帝国主义积极扩张，到处招摇撞骗；近又以其舰队在东地中海举行演习。上月末美舰队包括巡洋舰三艘、驱逐舰六艘、及航空母舰雷伊泰号，由美驶抵东部希腊岛屿后，举行爱琴海上之演习。本月二日，该舰队大部分驶抵博斯普鲁斯海峡，一部分巡洋舰则“访问”黎巴嫩之贝鲁特和叙利亚之拉塔基亚港。叙、黎报纸对此种帝国主义之行径大肆抨击，并提出抗议。圣亚西那报称：在叙利亚及黎巴嫩国会选举前夕，和正当联合国特别大会讨论阿拉伯人要求给予巴勒斯坦独立之际，美舰的抵达意味着金元帝国主义者图以武力威胁的策略，达到它损害叙、黎独立的目的。但是，这种策略一定会遭到失败。因为叙、黎人民非常珍视他们在长期反帝斗争中所赢得的独立。阿勒坡报界声明拒绝刊载任何美舰行动的消息。
    【新华社陕北十日电】开罗讯：埃及政府决议：拒绝英国军事顾问团之服务。政府将通知英国，要求解散四种依据一九三六年条约所成立的军事顾问团。为了重组埃及军队，政府正计划聘请其他国家的军事专家，特别拟聘请美国的陆、海、空军的军事专家们。按：前此美国已与埃及订立航空协定，攫取了埃及的航空权；埃及政府此一决议，显示美帝国主义将更进一步插足埃及，英美矛盾必然随之更趋尖锐。
    【新华社陕北十日电】综合消息：讨论巴勒斯坦问题之联合国特别大会于五、七两日曾举行大会，先后通过议案，允许犹太人协会和巴勒斯坦高级委员会代表出席政治委员会陈述意见。政治委员会于六日至八日连续举行会议，开始讨论巴勒斯坦调查委员会之组成及工作范围问题。美国代表提议组织一个“中立性”的调查委员会，由加拿大、捷克、伊朗、荷兰、秘鲁、瑞典及乌拉圭等七国为委员国，其权力极广泛，可以从事分析及检点各种情报，随意在任何地方集会并听取一切适当之保证。英代表附和其意见，苏联及法国、哥伦比亚、波兰、捷克、南斯拉夫等则主张苏、美、英、法、中五国全体或至少一部分参加调查委员会。苏代表并驳斥美国意见，谓中立性之调查委员会在政治上无可能性。
