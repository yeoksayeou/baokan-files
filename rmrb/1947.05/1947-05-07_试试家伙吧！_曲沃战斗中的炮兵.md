　　“Let's Try Out the Gear!"
    The Artillery in the Battle of Quwo
    Lang Qiao
    Having completed the tasks of the battles of Houma and Aikou, the artillery received the new task of attacking Quwo. Many soldiers shouted, "Great! We can have a good time this time! Let's try out the gear!" After scouting the terrain, the artillerymen, regardless of fatigue, began to build their positions in a tense atmosphere. Behind them, countless tall foreign mules carried mountain guns, mortars, rocket launchers, anti-tank guns... crossing the dust-filled avenues, they arrived near Quwo in the dark of night. As they approached the enemy's firing range near the North Gate, our cannons and shells laboriously passed through a four-hundred-meter trench. Enthusiastic feeders volunteered to help the sweaty artillerymen carry all the cannons and shells into the positions. On the East Gate side, a team of artillerymen unloaded, transported, loaded, and then transported the shells again, completing the entire process in just eight minutes. Such skilled technique and rapid action amazed even a certain commander who was always strict. He asked, "Are you really ready?" "Yes, we are really all ready!" Various cannons formed rows upon rows, layers upon layers of tight artillery formations. The dark gun barrels stood straight, the muzzles aimed at the enemy's bunkers and hidden pillboxes scattered everywhere. There was a blockhouse abandoned by the enemy with four layers of firepower installed. The bottom two layers were mountain guns, the third layer was rocket launchers, and the fourth layer was heavy machine guns. "This is really something. I've worked under Hu Zongnan for more than ten years and I've never seen so many cannons used in a battle!" This is what a liberated soldier, Li Zixiao, said with great interest, his eyes wide open, after seeing the artillery group east of the city.
    The artillerymen were waiting for the signal to fight. Suddenly, the first shell north of the city tore through the silent night sky, and all the other cannons immediately began to roar. In the heavy rumbling and violent explosions, the enemy's bunkers swayed in the firelight and then collapsed. The entire city of Quwo was trembling. Mountain gunner Zhang Ziming calmly aimed at a bunker and fired four shells in a row, each hitting the target. The infantrymen, taking the opportunity to advance to the front of the bunker, shouted desperately, "Good! Again! Good! Again!" When Zhang Ziming fired the fifth shell, someone in the bunker shouted, "We surrender!" Only then did he triumphantly move his gun position.
    Although the muzzle of gunner Ma Xirong's cannon could only aim at a ridge line of a square bunker slightly protruding outside the city wall from the side, all three of his shells hit the ridge line and destroyed the enemy, causing countless cheers.
    Each mountain gunner used only six shells to cover the infantry's breakthrough of the front line. The enemy fled to the East Gate, and our soldiers closely pursued them into the East Gate. The enemy then used the fortifications of the East Gate to resist, and our artillerymen, without time to see the terrain or dig fortifications, destroyed many of the enemy's fortifications in an exposed position. At this time, on our position, two soldiers, watching the stubborn enemy, angrily placed a large door on the outer moat and rolled the mountain gun across the door, immediately aiming at the enemy's bunker and firing. Two shells drilled into the gun holes of the bunker and exploded. They uttered a satisfied "Humph!" and were about to fire the third shell when news immediately came from the front: the enemy had already surrendered!
    After the infantry climbed the North City, the large bunker on the East City tower was also blown down by shells. The infantry climbed the badly damaged East City in the morning light, and then continued to pursue the enemy down the street with hand grenades.

　　“试试家伙吧！”
    曲沃战斗中的炮兵
    朗樵
    完成了侯马和隘口战斗任务的炮兵，接到攻曲沃的新任务后，许多战士都这样叫着：“好得很呀！可该过个饱瘾了！试试家伙吧！”侦察了地形的炮兵们，不顾疲劳，又紧张的筑起阵地来。后面无数高大的洋马驮骡载着山炮、迫击炮、火箭炮、战防炮，……踏过飞尘弥漫的大道，赶黑夜来到了曲沃附近。在接近了北关敌人火力能射到的阵地时，我们的炮和炮弹艰难地通过一条四百米的交通壕；热心的饲养员们自动帮助汗流夹背的炮兵将炮和炮弹全部抬入了阵地。东关方面有一队炮兵从卸、运、装又运了炮弹，整个过程仅用了八分钟。这种熟练的技术和迅速的动作，使一向要求严格的某指挥员也惊住了，他问：“你们真的准备好了吗”？“是的，真的都已经准备好了！”各种炮组成了一排一排、层层叠叠的严密炮阵。黑黝黝的炮身直挺着，炮口对准着散布在各处的敌人的堡垒和暗碉。有一个敌人丢弃的碉楼上安置了四层火器。下边两层是山炮，第三层是火箭炮，第四层是重机枪。“真了不得呀，我在胡宗南手下干了十几年还没见过用这么多的炮打仗哩！”这是解放战士李子效看了城东的炮群后兴致勃勃地瞪着眼睛说的。
    炮兵们在期待着战斗的信号。忽然，城北第一颗炮弹撕破了沉寂的夜空，别的炮立即全部吵叫起来。沈重的轰隆声和猛烈的爆炸声中，敌人的碉堡在火光下摇摆着，随即坍塌下来。整个的曲沃城都在战栗。山炮手张子明镇静的瞄准碉堡连发四炮，炮炮命中，乘机前进到碉堡跟前的步兵们拚命大喊：“好呀！再来！好呀！再来！”张子明射出第五发炮弹时，碉堡上有人喊：“缴枪了！”他才得意的转移了炮位。
    炮手马西容的炮口虽然只能从侧面对准一个稍微突出在城墙外面的方碉堡的一条棱线，但他的三发炮弹都从棱线上打了进去，消灭了敌人，引起无数人的欢呼。
    每个山炮手只用了六发炮弹就掩护步兵突破了前沿。敌人溃逃到东关，我们的战士就紧追进东关。敌人又利用东关的工事抵抗，我们的炮兵来不及看地形，挖工事，就在毫无隐蔽的地方摧毁了敌人许多工事。这时在我们的阵地上，有两个战士看着顽抗的敌人，激愤的将一扇大门搭上外壕，把山炮从门上滚了过去，立刻就瞄准敌人的碉堡发射起来。两颗炮弹钻进碉堡的枪眼里爆炸了。他们痛快的“哼”了一声，正要发出第三炮时，前面立刻传来消息：敌人已经投降了！
    步兵登上了北城以后，东城楼的大碉堡也被炮弹打翻下来。步兵们在晨光里登上了稀烂的东城，接着就用手榴弹继续向街心追逐敌人。
