　　Local Armed Forces Maintain Strict Vigilance
  　Northern Jiangsu Plain Prepares for Wheat Harvest
    [Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 25th Dispatch] Golden wheat fields cover the land, and farmers in the Northern Jiangsu Plain are sharpening their sickles and leveling their threshing grounds, preparing for the first summer harvest since the land reform. Since the beginning of spring, Northern Jiangsu has had timely and even rainfall, resulting in plump wheat grains. Jianyang County has already begun harvesting barley, with wheat yields expected to exceed 160 jin per mu. Mutual aid teams across the region are actively organizing. A village in Jianyang has formulated a mutual aid plan, putting forward slogans such as "Start early for wheat harvesting" and "Do not engage in sideline occupations during busy season," focusing all efforts on the summer harvest. Local armed militias are advancing into the peripheral areas, maintaining strict vigilance against the grain-grabbing Chiang Kai-shek troops. The Chiang Kai-shek and puppet troops in Huai'an have been holding meetings for days, preparing 20 trucks to attempt to seize 150,000 shi of grain in the Shitang District, east of the city. The military and civilians in the district are urgently making deployments. Cadres are fully armed, the elderly and weak are being transferred to the central area, leaving only the young and strong, in order to rush the harvesting, transportation, and storage of grain, so that not a single grain falls into enemy hands.

　　地方武装严密警戒
  　苏北平原准备麦收
    【新华社华中二十五日电】遍地金黄麦，苏北大平原农民正磨镰平场，迎接土地改革后第一度夏收。入春以来，苏北雨水调匀，麦粒饱满。建阳县境已开始收割大麦，小麦每亩可收一百六十斤以上。各地互助组正积极整理，建阳某村订出互助计划，提出“割麦起早”，“忙时不做副业”等口号，全力突击夏收。地方武装游击队挺进边缘区，严密警戒抢粮蒋军。淮安蒋伪连日开会，备好汽车二十辆，企图在城东石塘区抢粮十五万石。该区军民正紧急布署。干部全付武装，老弱转移至中心区，仅留下青壮年，以便抢割、抢运、抢藏，不使粒粮落入敌手。
