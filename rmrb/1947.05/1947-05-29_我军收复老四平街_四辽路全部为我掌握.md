　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, May 27th: Regarding Zhengjiatun, a unit of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army, after recovering Tongliao on the 22nd, continued to recover Bamiancheng on the 24th, and advanced to occupy Old Siping (more than ten miles west of Siping). The defending enemy fled towards Changwei and Siping. Another unit of the Democratic Allied Army took advantage of the victory to recover Dawa (southwest of Bamiancheng), where the enemy's 87th Division was annihilated last year. By now, the entire railway line extending over 300 miles from Old Siping in the east to Tongliao in the west has been completely controlled by the people.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, May 27th: In recent days, Du Yuming has been supporting the desperately struggling defenders of Meihekou with five or six airplanes daily. On the 24th, one of these planes was shot down by sharpshooters of a certain unit of the Democratic Allied Army. This is the second Chiang Kai-shek plane shot down during the summer offensive.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, May 26th: Yesterday (the 25th) at 9:00 AM, over 100,000 organized workers, students, government troops, and citizens of Harbin gathered in the park square to celebrate the great victory of the summer offensive of the patriotic self-defense war of the people inside and outside the customs. From early morning, enterprise workers' propaganda trucks and colorful trolley cars, carrying water-red arrows marking the situation of the People's Liberation Army's powerful offensive, paraded throughout the city along with youth students and citizen's Yangko dance teams. At the meeting, Mayor Liu Chengdong called on the 800,000 citizens of the city to mobilize urgently and respond to General Lin Biao's call to step up production and work. Zhou Huan, Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army, called for "using all our energy to ensure the supply of the front line and prepare for a major counter-offensive." Gao Chongmin, Vice Chairman of the Northeast Political Committee, reminded everyone: "Thoroughly eliminate Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents and further consolidate the rear." Li Zhaohuang, a combat hero of a certain unit who had just returned wounded from the front line, and Liu Yingyuan, a labor hero from the power plant, received prolonged cheers from the masses. After passing a telegram of tribute to the People's Army in East China, Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and Northeast China, and to General Lin Biao, the conference adjourned amidst the majestic singing of "Without the Communist Party, There Would Be No China."
