Deng Fuxuan and Others Discuss the Tangyin Battle
    Admiring Our Army's Fierce Artillery Fire           
    Complaining About Wang Zhonglian's Failure to Rescue
    [This Dispatch] Jiang's army's Provisional 3rd Corps captured Major General Chief of Staff Deng Fuxuan, 6th Detachment 2nd Regiment Colonel Regiment Commander Zhu Xiling, and others, discussed the Tangyin battle.
    Jiang's Provisional 3rd Corps Major General Chief of Staff Deng Fuxuan said dejectedly: "Your (referring to the People's Liberation Army, same below) troops arrived in the suburbs of Tangyin City, Commander-in-Chief Wang (referring to Wang Zhonglian) telegraphed Mr. Sun (referring to Sun Dianying), saying that you were fleeing to Tangyin. After a few days, we realized that your forces were strong and had surrounded the city layer by layer, and were planning to besiege Tangyin." Sun Dianying also said to his troops on April 15: "Liu Bocheng's army can only fight in the field, not attack fortifications." Obviously, this was another deception.
    "The battle in the northeast corner of the city was the most intense." The captured officers of the Provisional 3rd Corps spoke about this matter with a look of fear. Zhu Xiling, Colonel Regiment Commander of the 6th Detachment 2nd Regiment, said: "We fought the most tragically and suffered the heaviest casualties in the northeast corner of the city. Zhu Shurong, the commander of the 5th Detachment 1st Regiment, was wounded in the northeast of the city, and Deputy Commander Xia Yijun was killed in action. Wang, the commander of the 3rd Detachment, was also wounded there when he went to reinforce them. Zhang Ting'an, the deputy commander of the 5th Detachment and commander of the 2nd Regiment, is also missing."
    Zhu said: "You probably had more than 20 cannons, concentrated on bombarding the northeast corner of the city. Not only mountain guns and heavy mortars, but also howitzers!" Major General Chief of Staff Deng Fuxuan said: "The northeast corner of the city was flattened by the artillery for dozens of feet. Without ladders, your soldiers swarmed up from there." Qi Ziwan, the Chief of the Colonel Adjutant Office, said: "With such fierce artillery fire, we launched eight consecutive counterattacks, but they were of no use at all, and we only suffered casualties." Wang Shaozhen, the Major General Advisor of the Jiang Army's 3rd Corps Headquarters, said: "Our headquarters was also hit by five shells and was immediately thrown into chaos!" Zhu Xiling said: "Since we were besieged on April 5th, we have been waiting for reinforcements every day. Xinxiang and Jixian called and telegraphed today and tomorrow, always saying that reinforcements would arrive soon, but they never came." Wang Shaozhen said: "Later, we received Wang Zhonglian's telegram, asking us to hold on well, saying that reinforcements would arrive soon. At the same time, he told us to pay special attention and not let the Eighth Route Army sneak into the city in the uniforms of the 49th Brigade. From this, we knew that the reinforcements had suffered a loss."
    Zhu Xiling said: "We couldn't wait for reinforcements, but the planes came to resupply us every day. One day, you wounded a pilot, and the planes didn't dare to fly low anymore. The planes flew high, and often couldn't distinguish between us and the enemy, throwing bombs into the city and ammunition outside the city."

### 邓甫暄等谈汤阴战斗  佩服我军炮火猛烈  埋怨王仲廉不援救

　　邓甫暄等谈汤阴战斗
    佩服我军炮火猛烈           
    埋怨王仲廉不援救
    【本报讯】蒋军暂编三纵队被俘少将参谋长邓甫暄、六总队二团上校团长朱锡龄等谈汤阴战斗。
    蒋记暂编三纵队少将参谋长邓甫暄懊丧地说：“你们（指解放军下同）的部队到达汤阴城郊，王总司令（指王仲廉）曾电告孙先生（指孙殿英），说你们是溃窜汤阴。过了几天，才知道你们的兵力雄厚，已将城池层层包围，是有计划的围攻汤阴了。”孙殿英四月十五日向他的部队讲话时还说：“刘伯承的军队只能野战不能攻坚”。显然这又是欺骗。
    “城东北角战斗最激烈”。暂三纵队被俘军官谈到这件事都露出谈虎色变的神气，六总队二团上校团长朱锡龄说：“城东北角的战斗，我们打得最惨，伤亡最重，五总队一团团长朱述荣在城东北负伤，副团长夏以军阵亡。三总队王总队长增援上去，也在那里负伤，五总队副总队长兼二团团长张亭安也不知下落了”。
    朱氏说：“你们大概有二十多门炮，集中向城东北角轰击，不仅有山炮，有重迫击炮，还有榴弹炮”！少将参谋长邓甫暄说：“城东北角被大炮推平了十几丈，不用搭梯子，你们的战士就从那儿蜂拥而上了”。上校副官处长齐子万说：“炮火这样猛烈，我们连续反冲锋八次，丝毫没有顶事，结果只是遭受杀伤。”蒋军三纵队司令部少将顾问王少箴说：“我们的总司令部，也被击中五炮登时就乱了！”朱锡龄说：“自四月五日被围以后，我们便天天盼援兵，新乡、汲县今天来电话，明天来电报，总说援兵准到，但是总不见援兵来”。王少箴说：“后来接着王仲廉的电报，他要我们好好坚守，说援军准到。同时告诉我们，要特别留意，不要让八路军穿着四十九旅的服装混进城来。从此我们知道援军吃了亏。”
    朱锡龄说：“援兵盼不到，飞机还天天来接济，有一天你们打伤了一个驾驶员，以后飞机不敢低飞了。飞机飞得高，往往彼此不分，把炸弹扔到城里，把弹药扔到了城外。”
