　　Fucheng Three Thousand People Accuse and Seek Revenge; Arch-Criminal Brought to Justice
　　[Our newspaper, Anyang news] After the Fucheng Village in the Sixth District was occupied by the enemy last October, local tyrants, landlords, and the "Homecoming Corps" carried out extremely cruel massacres, endless plunder, and counter-settlements against the peasants who had turned over. The village, with 964 households, was extorted 90 million yuan in land and gun purchases alone. Other various levies and apportionments were numerous and impossible to calculate, and the peasants' land and property were counter-settled. Fifty people were reduced to begging with sticks due to counter-settlements. Even more cruelly, twelve peasants, including the chairman of the labor union, Zheng Jinhe, not only had all their property counter-settled but were also subjected to torture, some with iron nails hammered into the ground before being dragged naked, and finally buried alive. Another twenty people, including Zheng Quanbao, were detained and listed for live burial, but fortunately, they escaped when our army liberated the area. All the peasants who had turned over suffered various forms of fraud and disaster. On April 21st, Fucheng was liberated by our forces, and the people saw the light of day again. The democratic government immediately distributed about a thousand catties of relief rice, tens of thousands of catties of coal, and loans of 90,000 yuan to relieve military families, disaster-stricken families, and all disaster victims; re-organized the peasant association, and established democratic government and other organizations. After five days of mobilization, the masses ignited the flames of anger against counter-settlement and revenge. On April 28th, a grand memorial service was held, with more than 3,000 people participating. The venue was decorated with wreaths, elegiac couplets, and sacrifices from relatives and neighbors, creating a solemn and indignant atmosphere. Thirteen heroic spirits who had been buried alive were laid in repose in the mourning hall. Dozens of men and women filled the hall, emitting a burst of sorrowful crying. Wang Banglin's wife had been guarding the coffin of the deceased since morning, recounting the details of her husband's murder. Another old woman, having cried her eyes dry, still wiped her nose and cursed the landlord Li Kebi for burying her husband alive and feeding his body to the dogs. All the masses who attended the meeting shed tears of sorrow upon seeing such a tragic scene in the mourning hall. A woman carrying steamed buns to offer as a sacrifice fainted and fell against the wall, crying bitterly, drawing tears from many. During the memorial service in the morning, district and village cadres and representatives of the masses paid their respects, offered incense and sacrifices. A five-piece band (music) played mournful music, arousing the masses' hatred in their grief, demanding that the government publicly try the murderer Chang Zhu on the spot. Representatives elected by the masses conducted the public trial. As the murderer was brought to the venue, the masses immediately shouted, "Avenge our poor brothers!" "The murderer who buried people alive must pay with his life!"... A woman walked onto the stage, intending to publicly recount the cruelty of her husband's beating by the "Homecoming Corps" and his subsequent live burial, but she was so heartbroken that she couldn't speak a word. Another woman walked from the mourning hall to Chang Zhu and asked angrily, "Chang Zhu, did you bury my brother Wang Yanrong alive? Where exactly did you bury him?" Chang Zhu replied weakly, "Yes, he was buried in the northeast field of Chen's Well." Then several people accused Chang Zhu of his crimes. The government immediately announced the verdict, executing the murderer Chang Zhu by firing squad. The masses were all pleased, saying, "Our government has eliminated another scourge for us."

　　阜城三千群众诉苦复仇
    倒算凶犯伏法
    【本报安阳讯】六区阜城村自去年十月被敌占领后，恶霸、地主、“还乡团”，向翻身农民实行极惨酷的屠杀，无止境的掠夺和倒算。该村九百六十四户，仅敲诈地亩、买枪两项款即达九千万元，其他各种勒索摊派，花样繁多，无法计算，农民土地家产又被倒算。被倒算而拖着棍要饭者有五十口人，更惨忍的是工会主席郑金合等十二位农民，不但全部家产被倒算，且被非刑吊打，有的地上钉上铁钉，赤身拖打，最后全被活埋。还有郑全保等二十人被扣已列入活埋名单，幸遇我军解放而脱险。所有翻身农民都受尽了多种欺诈和灾难。四月二十一日，阜城被我解放，人民重见青天，民主政府立即发放救济米约千斤，煤炭万余斤，贷款九万元，救济军属、遭难家属、及所有灾难民；重新组织农会，建立民主政权等组织，群众经前后五天的发动，燃烧起反倒算复仇的怒火。四月廿八号，举行隆重的追悼大会，共参加三千余人，会场里花圈、挽联、及亲友邻居送的祭礼，布置的壮严而悲愤。灵棚里停殓着十三位被活埋的英灵，几十位男女坐满了灵棚，发出一片悲痛的哭声。王榜林的妻，从早晨一直守着死者的棺材，哭诉着她男人被害经过；另一个老太婆已经哭干了眼泪，还摸着鼻涕哭骂地主李克必活埋她男人，又把尸体喂了狗。凡到会的群众，看见灵棚里那样的惨景，都伤心的掉下了眼泪。一位妇女提着馍去献供，刚走近灵棚就哭的发晕，倒在墙根痛哭，引的好多人滚出了热泪。上午追悼时，区村干部、群众代表，都分别吊孝，并献香、献供，五班吹手（音乐）齐奏着哀乐，在悲痛中激起了群众的愤恨，要求政府当场公审杀人犯常柱的。群众选出代表进行公审，凶犯被提到会场上，群众立刻一片喊声：“为我们穷弟兄报血仇！”“要活埋人的凶手偿命！”……一位妇女走到台上，本想当众诉说她男人被“还乡团”痛打的惨忍，及活埋的经过，但伤心得哭不成声，一句话也没说出来。又一位妇女，从灵棚里走到常柱的根前，气忿忿的质问：“常柱的，俺哥王延荣是你活埋来不是？到底埋在那里啦？”常柱的没气力的答着：“是，埋在陈家井东北地里了。”接着好几个人控诉常柱的罪恶。政府当场宣判，将凶犯常柱的执行枪决，群众无不称快，都说：“咱政府可又给除了个祸根。”
