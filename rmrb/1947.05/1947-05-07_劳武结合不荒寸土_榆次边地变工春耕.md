Combining Labor and Military Affairs Does Not Waste an Inch of Land
Yuci Border Area Changes Work Teams for Spring Plowing

[Our Newspaper Taihang Fourth Telegram] After the preliminary implementation of land reform in the Yucheng border area, farmers began to cultivate their own land. However, due to the constant disturbances by the Yan puppet regime, production difficulties increased, and both the masses and cadres lacked confidence in production. To address this, the county leadership convened a production mobilization conference in mid-April with over 300 county, district, and village cadres. The conference resolved ideological concerns, established confidence in persisting with production in the border area, and promoted spring plowing through changing work teams without wasting an inch of land. Based on past and recent experiences, the following methods of combining labor and military affairs were derived: (1) The entire village participating in a large-scale work exchange is fundamental. In Dongqi, the militia is on the front line, the able-bodied are on the second line, and the elderly and weak are on the third line. Depending on the situation, the militia fights if they can, and if they can't, they cover the masses' retreat. Work points are calculated based on "people converting to points, land converting to work." (2) Joint defense work exchange, as in the villages of Gaoping and Dongxi Jianzi: When the situation is tight, the front village goes to the back village; when it's relaxed, the back village goes to the front; normally, the militia extends to the front to protect production. At the same time, people in the front send intelligence, and villages in the back help the villages in the front bury things, ensuring that they are not lost. (3) Mutual assistance between districts: Implement mountain areas supporting plains areas. Seize the season, plant early in the mountains, and provide appropriate wages when supporting the plains. (4) Guerrilla production: In enemy-adjacent areas, withdraw cadres, militia, and masses, and establish two sets of production, one on the mountains and one below. Seize the time, combine with the masses of the village to monitor the enemy, and return to the village to carry out surprise production. Or divide labor between front and rear, exchanging work with each other. (5) In villages behind enemy lines, implement concealed production like a "tiger in sheep's clothing." (6) Combat production cooperatives: × village raises shares within the village to open a cooperative in the rear. Last year, it earned 400,000, bought a rifle for the village, prepared to buy four donkeys, and organized small-scale exports of mountain products to exchange for necessities. When the situation is serious, it solves the difficulties for the withdrawing masses, organizes production, and can also raise pigs and open workshops, so that the border area can also carry out sideline production. In addition, armed activities must be used to create gaps in production: one is to blockade enemy strongholds with mines and cold shots, trapping the enemy. Another is to concentrate camp soldiers or militia at the focal point of the struggle to ambush and prevent enemy activities. Another is to send small armed forces to operate behind enemy lines, containing the enemy and covering production.

　　劳武结合不荒寸土
    榆次边地变工春耕
    【本报太行四日电】榆次边地初步实现土地改革后，农民开始在自己的土地上耕种，但由于阎伪的不断扰乱，使生产困难增加，群众与干部对生产都缺乏了信心，为此县领导上特于四月中旬召开了全县县区村干部三百余人的生产动员大会。会上解决了思想顾虑，树立坚持边地生产信心，不荒寸土变工春耕。并根据过去与最近经验，得出如下几种劳武结合办法：（一）全村大变工是基本的。东祁是民兵在第一线，青壮年在第二线，老弱第三线。看情况，能打民兵就打，打不过就掩护群众退却。计工折工按“人折分、地折工”。（二）联防变工，如高坪和东西见子等村是：情况紧时，前村到后村；松时后到前；平时民兵伸到前边生产掩护。同时前边人送情报，后边村帮助前边村埋藏东西，互相保证不受损失。（三）区与区互助：实行山地支援平地，抓紧季节，山地早种，到平地支援给以适当工资。（四）游击生产，在接敌区退出干部民兵群众，建立山上山下两套生产，瞅准时间结合本村群众监视敌人，回村突击生产。或者前后分工，互相变工。（五）敌后村，实行“老虎披羊皮”的隐蔽生产。（六）战斗生产合作社：×村在村内集股，到后边开合作社。去年赚了四十万，给村买了一支枪，准备买四头毛驴，并组织山货点滴出口，换回必需品。情况严重时，给退出群众解决困难，组织生产，又可养猪开作坊，使边地也能进行副业生产。此外，要用武装活动创造生产空隙：一种是用地雷冷枪封锁据点困住敌人。一种是在斗争焦点集中营兵或民兵打埋伏，阻止敌人活动。另一种是派小型武装到敌后活动，牵制敌人掩护生产。
