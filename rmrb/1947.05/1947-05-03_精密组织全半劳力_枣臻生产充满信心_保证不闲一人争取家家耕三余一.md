　　【Our newspaper, Lucheng News】The Fourth District Zaozhen Village held a production mobilization meeting in the district on April 21st. Each village made a production plan and challenged each other. Village cadres returned and held a meeting of all squad leaders and above that night, with active turn-over elements participating. Everyone first discussed how cadres could mobilize the masses to launch a production campaign. This village has a relatively solid foundation for organizing mutual aid groups, and cadres and activists are very confident. They replied: "Don't be afraid. Although there is a shortage of labor this year, we must organize and take on the battle to ensure that the land is well cultivated." Women cadres also guaranteed that women would go to the fields more this year and make up for the number of people joining the army and participating in the war. They must help men produce. Then, on the afternoon of the 22nd, a production mobilization meeting of 280 people, men, women, old and young, was held in the whole village. First, Han Tingzhao, the manager of the cooperative, talked about this year's production tasks and production policies, explaining that this year's production is to achieve cultivating three and saving one for every household, to promote excellent varieties, and to persuade the masses to plant more Golden Queen corn by using accounting methods. The slogan was loudly put forward: "Youths go to the front to participate in the war, and the rear intensifies production." The atmosphere of the conference was very high, showing the enthusiasm of the masses to get rich and prosperous after turning over. Then, group discussions were held to summarize the past experience of mutual aid groups and to determine future improvement methods. During the discussion, it was found that some old wage issues had not been cleared up, and dung buckets were lost. Everyone discussed and guaranteed to clear up old wages. If the dung buckets were lost, everyone would look for them. If they could not be found, everyone would compensate, and the problems would be solved. During the discussion, Han Lan said: "Our production team wants to challenge the fourth team. Now, we will finish planting Golden Queen corn, hemp, flax, and cotton by the 15th day of the third lunar month, and complete all the sowing from the 16th day of the third lunar month to the 13th day of the fourth lunar month, ensuring that no one in each team is idle. If the third team catches an idle person from the fourth team, the person caught will work for the third team's military dependents for half a day; it is necessary to hold meetings frequently to discuss the division of labor and who to work for first, implement work recording according to the work done, exchange labor between the old and the young, whoever can do what does what, use work tickets, and clear labor accounts every ten days." Han Xiao Liu said: "Using livestock to pull manure can save labor, and transforming two-legged plows so that women and children can pull seedlings can also save labor." Woman Han Laigai said: "Women should help men rake the stubble, sow seeds, spread manure, etc., and also complete weaving tasks. Women who go to the fields exchange labor with women at home, and men and women exchange labor. For example, making a pair of shoes requires men to pay back six work units, sewing a shirt requires men to pay back two work units, etc." The whole village is divided into four brigades and nineteen mutual aid groups. The whole village has 3,951 mu of autumn land and 64 livestock. There are 94 young and middle-aged laborers, and 62 elderly people (over 55 years old), each of whom accounts for seven or eight tenths, which is equivalent to 144 full laborers. Each laborer has an average of more than 27 mu of land. 45 women and 21 children can work in the fields, and each three people account for one laborer, which is equivalent to 22 laborers. This kind of labor exchange can solve the difficulty of labor shortage. After such precise calculation, everyone's confidence was even higher, and the emotions were very high. Then everyone discussed the wages. Plowing one mu of land earns one work unit (10 jin of rice), and harrowing three mu and planting three mu equals plowing one mu. On the spot, the masses elected seven technical experts, with Chang Wentong as the director of the Technical Research Committee. Immediately, a production committee was established to unify the leadership of everyone's production, and the village chief and political director were publicly elected as the chairman of the committee, and the remaining village cadres were members. Everyone proposed that the production committee should lead everyone's production well, unify the allocation of labor and livestock, and the cooperative should guarantee work ticket credit. After the meeting, those who carried manure carried manure, those who repaired the land repaired the land, and those who harrowed the land harrowed the land. A surge of enthusiasm filled the whole village. (Shen Wen, Xiang Zheng, Gui Jian)
