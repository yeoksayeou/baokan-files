　　[This newspaper, Ji Lu Yu, 9th dispatch] The people in the Chiang-occupied areas have no way out and are rising up to join the People's Liberation Army to take revenge on Chiang Kai-shek. When a unit of the People's Liberation Army wiped out stubborn puppet strongholds near Anyang, two young farmers from × village, Wang Jinzhu and Jin Xueshi, came to the troops to volunteer for the army. They explained why they wanted to join the Eighth Route Army: "We have no way to go to heaven and no way to enter the earth. This is the only way." Wang Jinzhu said: "My family originally had twelve mu of land and six people. When the Kuomintang army came, they demanded donations and taxes every day. Last year, after the autumn harvest, my family had nothing to eat or drink. We had no choice but to borrow 700,000 yuan of Chiang currency from the landlord's family, with an interest of 100 yuan per 10,000 yuan per day. At the end of the year, the interest alone was more than 600,000 yuan, and even if we gave the land and houses to the landlord, it would not be enough. The Bao chief and lackeys kept coming to demand grain and donations. The day before yesterday, I borrowed a liter of millet from my neighbor, and it happened that someone came to demand a donation, and they took it away without saying a word. After being hungry for a day, I thought for a long time, and the only way out was to become a soldier in the Eighth Route Army." Jin Xueshi said, "The Central Army has only been here for a year, and my livelihood has been taken away by them. Seventeen mu are left with three mu, and seven houses are left with one. I have long heard that the Eighth Route Army implements the liberation of the poor. I thought you would come when the wheat was ripe, but I didn't expect you to come now. If we don't do it, who will? If we don't take revenge on Old Chiang, who will?"
    [This newspaper, Ji Lu Yu, 9th dispatch] On the second day after the liberation of Dongping, the democratic government immediately entered the city to conduct investigations, condolences, and relief work. When reporters visited, residents constantly gathered to complain about the atrocities of the Chiang army. An old woman outside the east gate said with tears in her eyes: "If your Eighth Route Army hadn't come, I wouldn't be able to live. My two daughters were falsely accused by the scoundrels of being the Eighth Route Army's wives and were forced into the house, saying it was an inspection. My two daughters… they still can't get out of bed." She choked with sobs. Another old man said, "More than two hundred old people were detained in the prison. Now it has been found that more than sixty people were buried alive, and the whereabouts of the others are unknown." Then many people asked in unison, "Will the Eighth Route Army leave after all? If you are going to leave, please tell us first, we will follow the Eighth Route Army to the death!" Later, the reporter explained to them the government's determination to persist and told them the news of victories on all fronts, and smiles appeared on the faces of the masses.

　　蒋区人民走头无路  纷纷奋起参加我军
    【本报冀鲁豫九日电】蒋占区老百姓走头无路，纷纷奋起参加人民解放军，向蒋介石复仇。人民解放军×部扫荡安阳附近顽伪据点时，×村农民青年王金柱、靳学士二人来部队志愿参军，他们说明为啥要参加八路军道：“俺们都是上天无路，入地无门，只有这一条路了。”王金柱说：“我家本来有十二亩地六口人，遭殃军来了，每天要捐要税，去年刚收罢秋，弄的我家便没有吃喝了，没法只得向地主家借七十万元蒋币，每万元每天出利一百元，年底一算账，光利该人家六十多万，把土地房屋都算给地主还不够，保长和狗腿还不断的来要粮要捐前天我刚从邻居借了一升小米，正巧碰上要捐的来了，二话没说就给拿走啦。受了一天饿，寻思了半天，就剩下当八路军这条活路了。靳学士说：“中央军来了才一年，我的过活也被他要干净了，十七亩剩下三亩，七间房子扒的剩了一间。早就听说八路军实行穷人翻身，俺打量着您等到麦熟才来，想不到您现在来了，咱不干谁干？咱不向老蒋报仇谁报？”
    【本报冀鲁豫九日电】东平解放的第二天，民主政府立即进城进行调查、慰问、救济等工作。当记者走访时，居民不断围聚申诉蒋军暴行，东门外一老妇满眶盈泪说：“咱八路不来，俺活不下去啦，俺两个闺女被孬种诬为八路的太太，硬逼进房子来，说是检查，俺两闺女就………，现在还不能起床。”说罢哽咽不已。另一老翁说：“监狱里拘囚了二百多老百姓，现在查出来六十多人被活埋了，其他人不知下落”。接着很多人一齐问：“八路军到底还走不？要走，千万先告诉俺，死活是跟八路军走呢？”后来记者对他们解释了政府坚持的决心，并告诉了他们各战线的胜利消息，群众的面上现出了笑容。
