Those With Grievances, Report Grievances; Those With仇, Seek Revenge
Hua and Jun County Masses Rise Up to Overthrow Their Oppressors
[Report from the Jilu豫 Frontline by Our Newspaper, 4th] Frontline reporter Wu Xiang reports: In the vast recovered areas of Hua County and Jun County, peasants are bravely launching struggles against grain hoarding and implementing land reform. In Baying Village, 30 *li* east of Hua County city, a peasant meeting of over 3,000 people was held at the beginning of the month, enthusiastically discussing taking up guns in one hand and distributing land in the other. The militia activists from each village returned to their villages and arrested the traitorous despotic landlords that night. The next day, a mass meeting was held in the district to convey the message that the democratic government was determined to support the peasants' land demands and resolutely suppress the big evil despots who killed people and hoarded grain. The peasants' emotions were extremely high, and the situation was opened up in dozens of villages immediately. The militia and farmer association members have had rapid development. At this time, Hua County city has not yet been recovered, and fierce fighting is taking place on both sides of the Wei River. To prepare for a long-term struggle, combat preparations are also underway. Subsequently, the militia in the Second District fought eight battles in seven days. Later, three militiamen from Houyufang Village repelled over 100 of Jiang’s diehard Ding Shuben’s troops, capturing 13. The entire district was invigorated, and everyone had the confidence to implement land reform during the war. After Jun County was recovered, militia and farmer association activists returned to their villages to lead the struggle against grain hoarding. In Zhangjiadian, 30 *li* southwest of the city, a meeting was held on the 21st to struggle against Zhang Xuekong, who had hoarded 120 *shi* of grain and murdered two militiamen. After the masses bitterly accused him, he was immediately detained, and all his grain and ill-gotten wealth were distributed to the masses.
[Report from the Jilu豫 Frontline by Our Newspaper, 4th] Frontline reporter Wu Xiang reports: After two brigades of Jiang's troops were annihilated in the area north of Daokou, west of the Wei River, the masses in each village warmly welcomed the People's Liberation Army and denounced the atrocities of Jiang's troops. When the × unit entered Chen Village, Dayulin and Xiaoyulin, the villagers happily brought out boiled water as soon as they entered the village. The soldiers were surprised that the water was boiled so quickly. The villagers said, "Just now, the *manzi* soldiers (referring to Jiang's troops) were crowded in the village. Seeing them so flustered, we knew that our troops would arrive soon." When Jiang's troops retreated, they conscripted men, seized cattle and donkeys, and ransacked through boxes and cabinets in each village. Su Xuekun from Xue Village hid under the bed but was still taken away, leaving behind his old mother and a seven-year-old younger brother, who cried for a day without eating. Jiang's troops were completely wiped out by the Wei River. As soon as the gunfire stopped, the villagers followed behind the Eighth Route Army to find their livestock. They happily said, "Luckily, our troops chased quickly! Luckily, our troops chased quickly!" Jiang's troops locked several women from Chen Village in a house, saying they were searching for artillery shells, and even searched their crotches, and as a result, they were all raped. An old Mr. Li from Xin Village asked the × unit's battalion commander if this battle was commanded by General Liu Bocheng. The battalion commander asked him in return, "Do you know Liu Bocheng?" He gave a thumbs up and said, "I know! I know! Invincible General Liu Bocheng!"
