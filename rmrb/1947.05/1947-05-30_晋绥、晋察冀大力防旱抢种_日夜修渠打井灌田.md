Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th. Jin Sui and Jin-Cha-Ji are vigorously launching drought prevention and rush planting movements. After the Jin Sui Administrative Office issued the call for "dry farming and dry planting" and "carrying water to plant cotton," farmers have mostly stopped waiting for rain and have begun to rush planting. Cadres from all counties have gone to the countryside to lead the emancipated peasants in mutual aid farming. Personnel from various troops and organizations in the area are fully helping farmers carry water to plant cotton. Some areas have now completed sowing. In Qiujia Village, Shenfu, the entire village is working together, cultivating the land in order regardless of whose land it is, and then calculating work points, completing everything in twenty days. In two border villages in Xin County, emancipated peasants worked overnight under torchlight to build a large canal that can irrigate 3,500 mu of land. Farmers in five villages including Xin Xiaoying and Bai Village in Zhi County have built five canals that can irrigate 5,000 mu of land. In riverside areas such as Dai County and Xing County, farmers are opening canals and using waterwheels to irrigate fields day and night. A well-digging movement has been launched in the central Hebei area of Jin-Cha-Ji. In Wenxin County Town, 108 wells were dug in eight days. In Dongguan, Li County, 210 wells have been dug in one month, and efforts are now being made to complete one well per household. All other county governments are vigorously leading well-digging work. Along the Hutuo River, counties are opening canals while also building dikes to prevent summer and autumn flooding. The democratic government of Yutian County in eastern Hebei led the opening of a 47-li-long canal, flowing through more than 100 villages and irrigating more than 200,000 mu of land. The upsurge of repairing canals and digging wells has spread throughout the central and eastern Hebei plains. In addition to carrying water to plant seeds, farmers in the mountainous areas of Jin and Hebei are also making every effort to divert mountain springs to irrigate the land.

    【新华社陕北二十六日电】晋绥、晋察冀大力展开防旱抢种运动。晋绥行署发出“干耕干种”及“担水种棉”的号召后，农民多已不再等雨，开始抢种。各县干部均下乡率领翻身农民互助耕种。该区各部队、机关人员均全力帮助农民担水种棉。现部分地区已完成下种。神府邱家村全村变工，不管谁家地依次耕种后算工，二十天即全部完成。忻县边地两村翻身农民连夜在火把下修成大渠一条，可浇地三千五百亩，峙县新小营、白村等五村农民已修成水渠五条，可浇地五千亩。代县及兴县等沿河地区，农民均日夜开渠、车水灌田。晋察冀冀中地区掀起打井运动，文新县城关八天即打井一百零八眼，蠡县东关一月间已打成二百一十眼，现在努力完成一户一井。其他各县政府均大力领导打井工作。沿滹沱河各县一面开渠，一面即筑堤防夏秋泛滥。冀东玉田县民主政府领导开成四十七里大渠一条，流经一百余村，可浇地二十余万亩。修渠、打井热潮遍及冀中、冀东大平原。而冀晋山地农民除担水点种外，亦尽力引山泉灌地。
