Immediately Whip the Horse and Speed Up the Struggle
  　A Record of the Revenge and Retribution Conference in Xiaogao Town
    Xiaogao Town in WuZhi County, with more than 500 households, had carried out two months of rent and interest reduction struggles before the enemy occupation. After our withdrawal last October, the enemy, led by the landlords, retaliated against the turned-over peasants, unreasonably taking back the fruits of the struggle. This January, we drove away the enemy, and Xiaogao regained its liberation. Following the successive victories in the North Henan War, the flames of revenge and retribution in Xiaogao ignited.
    May 10th was the most bustling day in Xiaogao Town. Groups of men, women, old and young people gathered in the woods by the village. Everyone was smiling. Some walked and talked, "We're going to fight again!" The students said, "The Eighth Route Army can't have a meeting without us." They automatically blew whistles and chattered, following the adults to the meeting place and sitting on the grass. They desperately sang in loud voices, "Traitor Chiang Kai-shek is America's godson. Wearing an American hat, dressed in American clothes, holding American new weapons, attacking our liberated areas."
    The conference began, and the town leader reported, "Today, we will settle accounts with the traitors, spies, and local bullies, and take back the fruits of the struggle, houses, land..." Before he finished speaking, someone shouted, "Song Guangxin grabbed eight acres of my peanuts. Ask him why?" "Why?" "Why?" Several people sternly questioned, demanding that the head retributions answer. Someone jumped onto a chair and gesticulated, saying, "When Chiang's troops came, they said my brother was in the farmers' association, and it was illegal to work for the people. They killed my brother and robbed me of everything. The rifle butt hit my leg, and it still hurts. They also told me to watch my head. My head is still on my neck. Today, I want everyone to judge what crime I have committed. I've been suffocating all winter and spring!" He only said half of what he wanted to say, and his wife pushed him aside, stood on the chair, and said, "I tilled the land, and I hoed the crops. The bullies seized the land and robbed the grain, and then they wanted donations, saying they would kill anyone who disagreed?" She cried out and burst into tears.
    A large crowd stood up, wiping away tears, and continuously recounting the tragic events of their family members being harmed. The resentment of the crowd deepened, and they all scrambled to speak on the chairs. Finally, one person said decisively, "We can't finish telling our grievances, and crying can't bring the dead back to life. When the enemy comes, they give us a warning display of force. We will immediately whip the horse and speed up the struggle so they can never enter Xiaogao Town again." Everyone agreed, and the masses advanced in several groups, going to the homes of landlords and bullies to take back their belongings.
    Large carts pulled, small carts pushed, some carried on poles, and women ran, sweating profusely. "Let's go, again!" They carried it again and again until it was dark. Grain, clothing, and furniture filled the Lao Jun Temple. It was dark and they hadn't eaten yet. Someone suggested, "Let's go back and eat, and come back tomorrow to identify our things."

　　马上加鞭快斗争
  　记小高镇复仇反倒算大会
    武陟县小高镇，五百多户人家，敌占前进行过两个月减租减息斗争，去年十月我们撤退后，敌人带领地主向翻身农民倒算，无理夺回斗争果实。今年正月我们赶走敌人，小高重获解放，跟着豫北战争节节胜利，小高群众复仇倒算的怒火燃烧起来。
    五月十日是小高镇最热闹的一天，一群一群的男女老少在村边树林里集中起来。每个人都笑嘻嘻的，有人边走边说：“咱们又要斗啦！”小学生们说：“八路军开会离不了咱这一伙伙。”自动吹起哨子唧唧喳喳的跟着大人们跑到会场，坐在草地上。他们拚命的放大声音唱着：“汉奸蒋介石，是美国干儿子。头戴美国帽，身穿美国衣，手拿美国新武器，进攻咱们解放区。”
    大会开始了，镇长报告：“今天要向汉奸特务恶霸们清算，要回斗争果实，房子、土地……”话没说完便有人喊起来：“宋广心抢了我八亩花生，问问他到底是为啥？”“为啥？”“为啥？”一连有好几个人严厉责问，要倒算头子们回答。一个人跳到椅子上指手划脚的说：“蒋军来了，说我哥在农会，为老百姓办事犯法，杀了我哥还不算，把我的东西也抢光了，枪托打我的腿到现在还疼着，还叫我招呼点脑袋，我的脑袋还在脖子上长着，今天我要叫大家评评我有啥罪，闷了一冬天一春天啦！”话只说了半截，他的女人把他推到一边，也站椅子上说：“地是我种的，庄稼是我锄的，恶霸们夺了地又抢了粮，返回头又要捐款，说个啥道理就要杀人呀？”她喊嚷着就放声大哭起来。
    大堆的人站了起来，一面擦泪，一面接连不断的诉出各自亲家属被人害的惨事。人群的怨愤越来越深，都同时争着要上椅子说话，最后有一个人斩钉截铁的说：“说不完苦楚，哭不活死人，敌人来了是下马威风，我们要来个马上加鞭快斗争，跑了和尚跑不了寺，咱叫他再不能进小高镇。”全体通过了，群众分几路挺进，到地主恶霸家拿自己的东西。
    大车拉，小车推，挑的抬的，妇女们也跑的满头大汗。“走，再去！”一趟又一趟搬到天黑，粮食、衣物、家具老君庙放了满满一院子，天黑了都还没有吃饭，有人提议“回去吃饭明天再来认咱的东西。”
