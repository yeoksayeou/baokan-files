Inspire Fighting Spirit and Carry Out Revenge
The Experience of Mobilizing the Masses in the Recovered Areas of Anyang
Bei Dou

Since mid-April, the masses in the vast recovered areas of Anyang have launched struggles against traitors, secret agents, local bullies, landlords, and the Returning Home Corps. In the process of working for more than ten days, the following experiences were gained:

I. Launching a political offensive to expose the enemy's rumors and propaganda, and stabilize the people's emotions.

When the enemy fled, they spread rumors saying: "The Eighth Route Army tells men, women, and children to step on landmines." They also said: "District cadre Yang Shuqu was dragged to death, and you will be struggled against." They attempted to use this to confuse the people of all classes and create unstable emotions. However, when Comrade Yang Shuqu returned and walked through Shuiye Street, and Song Sheng of the Shuiye Explosives Team removed 69 landmines buried by the enemy and put them on display at the entrance, the masses understood and said: "The Eighth Route Army truly loves and saves the people, while the Central Army harms and kills the people." The county government also issued a notice to severely punish local bullies, landlords, liquidation leaders, secret agent leaders, and Returning Home Corps leaders. Those who were coerced and forced to participate, as long as they had not killed anyone, were allowed to "wash their faces and wipe away the black marks" with the consent of the masses, and were treated leniently. The county government immediately allocated 8 million catties of relief grain to support industry and commerce, and loaned 8 million yuan to help poor farmers who had been squeezed dry by the enemy and had no food. At the same time, the County Federation announced the peasant struggle program, posted it in various villages, and wrote it at village intersections. The program emphasized: "Revenge for hatred, redress grievances, vent pent-up anger, recover the fruits of struggle, and realize land to the tiller." After this period of work, the emotions of the masses stabilized, and some people who had been deceived and fled returned, saying: "If we had known this, why would we have run away? We were fooled by the enemy."

II. Classifying classes, clarifying and isolating the targets of struggle.

Each village re-classified classes, and the masses judged the size of the crimes of local bullies, landlords, and personnel of the puppet army and puppet organizations to determine the severity of the punishment. The method used was combined with the distribution of loans and relief grain. This was done well in Qugou. They clarified the class lines, isolated the targets of struggle, and made it clear who was on their side and should be united, and who was the target of struggle and should be fought against. Therefore, the masses in Qugou quickly took action, holding two consecutive struggle meetings and public trials, and executing the most heinous Wang Zhijia, Li Mingxiang, Li Baiyin, and Fan Guilin. One person was immediately "washed clean," and three people were sentenced to prison by the government.

III. Breaking the masses' "change of dynasty" mentality by combining visits to recount suffering.

Due to the enemy's rumors when they fled and the pain of enemy rule, although the masses saw our strength, their "change of dynasty" mentality was still extremely serious. We cannot think that the problem can be solved by holding a meeting or giving a speech, or that other work can be done after breaking the "change of dynasty" mentality. Instead, it must be combined with work and thoroughly and meticulously integrated into every task and opportunity, exposing the enemy's rumors, affirming that the Chiang army will be defeated, and strengthening the people's confidence. In addition, every person in the recovered area has suffered, such as the burden of enemy taxes, liquidation debts, and extortion by the enemy. We should use the "narrating Chang's family history" method to visit them individually. In the interviews, we must summarize where the suffering comes from to raise class awareness, pointing out the harm caused by Chiang Kai-shek and the landlord class. After active elements emerge during the visits, use them to connect with other sufferers. This process of visiting and connecting should then be developed into recounting suffering. The small-to-large approach is a necessary process for the masses in the newly recovered areas during the period when the "change of dynasty" mentality exists. At the same time, recounting suffering should also be developed from small-group recounting to large-scale recounting. This is how it was done in Qugou. This is also a gradual process of cultivating the masses' courage to struggle and raising their awareness in the course of struggle. The masses in Dongjie and Xiguan Xijie in Shuiye said: "We must not let the Central Army pass, we must fight them." The masses in the Second, Third, and Eighth Districts demanded guns, saying: "We must fight to the end."

IV. The problem of unity between cadres from the mountains, old cadres at home, and the masses.

The cadres from the mountains have gone through difficult and arduous struggles, sacrificing blood and lives for more than five months. After coming down from the mountains, they often show arrogance and conceit, looking down on the masses and the old cadres at home. At the same time, the old cadres and the masses at home feel that they have not contributed much, and they are embarrassed and unwilling to see the cadres. Therefore, a "gully" has been created between the cadres from the mountains and the cadres and masses at home. In order to "fill the gully" and strengthen the relationship between the two sides, first hold a self-criticism meeting for the cadres from the mountains, criticizing the cadres who have a bad attitude towards the masses after coming down from the mountains, and proposing to change the style of work and unite with the cadres and masses at home. Then hold a reunion meeting for the cadres from the mountains and the cadres from the home, and expand the leadership group by discovering active elements in the visits, connecting, and recounting suffering, so that the cadres at home still have positions and power. In Shuiye, the leadership affirmed the contributions of the cadres from the mountains at the cadre meeting, and also pointed out that there are still areas where they are not as good as the cadres at home. For example, the situation has changed greatly in five months, and we do not understand the situation as much as the cadres at home. Turning over is not just about turning over ourselves, but still needs to be combined with the broad masses, otherwise we cannot turn over ourselves. The leadership finally pointed out: "Whoever unites the most people is a good cadre," "Good must be good to the end, bringing honor to the people from the mountains." In this way, the relationship between cadres and the masses is strengthened, and they work together and turn over together.

V. Organizing joint struggles to lead the backward.

At the meeting in Qugou, Fifth District, on May 2nd, to struggle against Li Baiyin and others, cadres and masses from more than a dozen surrounding villages were invited to participate. After the meeting, the cadres of Zhangdeng Village said: "We must do it too when we go back!" And twelve active elements who recounted their suffering emerged. In the First District, when struggling in Gangxi, cadres and masses from more than a dozen villages in two base points were invited to participate, and after returning to their villages, their enthusiasm also increased. This joint struggle has greatly promoted the movement of recounting suffering and revenge at this stage.

　　激发斗志开展复仇
    安阳收复区发动群众经验
    北斗
    四月中旬以来，安阳广大收复区群众，与汉奸、特务、恶霸、地主、还乡团等展开了斗争。在十几天工作过程中，获得如下几点经验：
    一、开展政攻，揭破敌人造谣宣传，安定群众情绪。
    敌人窜逃时造谣说：“八路军叫男女小孩趟地雷。”又说：“区干部杨树渠被拖死了，你们还不被斗。”企图用此来迷惑各阶层群众，造成情绪不稳。但当杨树渠同志回来在水冶街走了一趟，水冶爆炸队宋生将敌埋地雷起了六十九个，放在门口展览后，群众了解了，说：“八路军真是爱民救人，中央军害民杀人。”县政府又出布告，严惩恶霸地主、倒算头子、特务头子、还乡团头子，对胁从分子，只要没杀过人，经群众同意准予洗脸擦黑，从轻处理。县府并立即拨救济粮八百万斤，用作扶助工商业，并贷款八百万元，来救济被敌压榨无食的贫农。同时县联会宣布农民斗争纲领，张贴各村，并在村内街路口写出，纲领上着重指出：有仇报仇有冤报冤，出透闷气，追回斗争果实，实现耕者有其田。经过这一段工作，群众情绪稳定下来，部分受骗外逃的人，也回来了。说：“要知道这样，咱跑个啥，咱上了敌人的当了。”
    二、划分阶级，明确与孤立斗争对象。
    各村重新进行划分阶级，对恶霸、地主及伪军伪组织人员，由群众评判其罪恶大小，决定处理轻重，在做的方法上，与发放贷款救济粮结合进行。这一点在曲沟做的好，他们划清了阶级阵线，把斗争对象孤立起来，明确了谁和自己是一家人，而应团结，谁是斗争对象，要向他们斗争。因此，曲沟集的群众很快的行动起来，连着开了两个斗争大会，公审大会，枪决了罪大恶极的王志家、李明祥、李白银、范桂林，当场洗脸擦黑释放了一人，由政府判处徒刑的三人。
    三、打破群众变天思想与访苦串苦诉苦相结合。
    由于敌人窜逃时的造谣与敌统治时惨痛，群众虽看到我们的力量，但群众变天思想仍极严重，我们在认识上不能以为开个会或宣传一下就解决了问题，或以为打破变天思想后，再做其他工作，而是必须结合工作，深入的细密的贯串在每个工作与机会中，揭破敌人造谣，肯定指出蒋军必败，坚定群众信心。另外收复区每个群众都有苦，如对敌负担苦、倒算苦、被敌讹诈苦等，用叙常家方式，去个别访问。在访问中，要总结出苦从那里来以提高到阶级认识，指出蒋介石及地主阶级的害人，在访苦中涌现出积极分子后，用他去串苦。把这个访苦、串苦，再发展到诉苦。由小而大的方式，是新收复区群众变天思想存在时期必经的过程。同时诉苦也是由小组的小型诉苦再发展到大会诉苦，在曲沟集即是这样搞起来的。这也是在斗争行动中逐步锻炼群众的斗争勇气，提高其认识。水冶东街与西关西街群众说：“中央军来了怎样也不能过，非和他干不行。”二、三、八区的群众要求发枪说：“非干到底不行。”
    四、山上干部与在家旧干部及群众的团结问题。
    山上干部经过艰难困苦，牺牲流血斗争了五个多月，下山后往往表现骄傲、自大，看不起群众，看不起旧干部；同时在家旧干部及群众，感到自己没出啥力，脸上没光，不愿见干部。因此在山上干部与在家干部及群众中间划了一条鸿沟，为了“填沟”密切双方关系，先开山上干部的检讨会，批评下山来对群众态度作风不好的干部，提出要改变作风，团结在家干部及群众。然后召开山上与山下干部团圆会，在访苦、串苦、诉苦中发现积极分子扩大到领导集团来，使在家干部仍有职有权。水冶领导上，在山上干部会上肯定山上干部的功劳，又指出尚有不如在家干部的地方。如五个月的情况变化很大，我们不如在家干部了解情况多，翻身不是自己翻身，仍要与广大群众结合起来，否则自己也不能翻身。领导上最后指出：“谁团结人多，谁是好干部”、“好要好到底，与山上人增光”。这样密切了干群关系，一道作工作，一道翻身。
    五、组织联合斗争带落后
    在五区曲沟集群众于五月二号斗争李白银等的大会上，吸收周围十几个村干部及群众来参加。会后鄣邓村干部说：“咱回去也要干呀！”并涌现出十二个诉苦的积极分子。一区在岗西斗争，吸收两个基点十几个村干部及群众去参加，回去后在本村干劲也起来了。这个联合斗争，对现阶段诉苦复仇运动的推动很大。
