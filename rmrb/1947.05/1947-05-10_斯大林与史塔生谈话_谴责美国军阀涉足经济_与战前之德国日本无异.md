Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th: Washington dispatch: Former Minnesota Governor Stassen (a Republican leader) released here on the 3rd of this month a summary of his conversation with Marshal Stalin in the Kremlin on April 9th. The following is part of the conversation: Stassen asked: I would like to know if you believe that the economic systems of the United States and the Soviet Union can coexist harmoniously in the world? Stalin replied: It is obvious that they can coexist. As far as cooperation is concerned, the differences between the two systems are not important or fundamental. The two systems are different, but we have not fought each other, and the Soviet Union has no intention of doing so. If the two systems could cooperate during the war, why can't they cooperate in peacetime? Of course, this is assuming that the desire for cooperation exists. Because if this desire does not exist, even two similar systems will still fight each other. Stassen asked: Did you seem to make the opposite statement before the war? Stalin replied: I have never made such a statement. I only said that if one side is unwilling to cooperate, there will be a danger of capitalist encirclement and attack on the Soviet Union. In fact, Germany did carry out such an attack. Stassen believed that there were great differences between the United States and Germany before the war; Stalin said: The two governments are different, but the economic systems are not different. Finally, Stalin condemned the involvement of US warlords in the economy, believing that it would lead to bad consequences, as evidenced by Japan and Germany. According to Stassen, Stalin was very interested in the issue of the US economic crisis and said that he was paying close attention to the development of the domestic economic situation in the United States.

　　斯大林与史塔生谈话
    谴责美国军阀涉足经济  与战前之德国日本无异
    【新华社陕北七日电】华府讯：美国前明列苏答州州长史塔生（共和党领袖之一）本月三日在此间发表他于四月九日在克里姆林宫与斯大林元帅会见时之谈话纪要。下面是谈话问答的一部分：史塔生问：我愿意知道是否你相信美苏两国经济制度能够和谐地并存于世界？斯大林答：它们能够并存是显然的。就合作问题而论，两制度间的差异不是重要的，也不是基本的。两制度是不同的，但我们并未彼此作战，苏联也并无此种企图。假如战时两个制度能够合作，为什么在和平时期它们不能合作？当然，这是假定合作愿望存在着的话。因为假使这种愿望不存在，纵使是两个类似的制度，仍然是会彼此作战的。史问：阁下在战前似乎作过相反的声明？斯答：我从没有作过此种声明。我仅仅说过：假如一方面不愿意合作，是会有资本主义包围进攻苏联的危险的。事实上，德国即进行了此种进攻。史问：是否苏联曾经可以和德国合作？斯答：是的，但是德国人不愿合作。史塔生认为美国与德国在战前有很大差异；斯大林说：两个政府是有差异的，但经济制度并无差异。最后斯大林对美国军阀涉足经济加以谴责，认为势将引起恶果，日本及德国即其明证。据史塔生称：斯大林对美国经济危机问题甚感兴趣。并谓斯氏正专心注意美国国内经济情势之发展。
