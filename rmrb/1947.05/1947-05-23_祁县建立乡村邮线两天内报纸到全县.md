　　Qixian Establishes Rural Postal Routes, Newspapers Reach the Entire County in Two Days

　　[Our Newspaper] Qixian County Head and County Secretary personally promoted the establishment of rural postal routes. In the past, the county used the method of dispatching messengers. Liang Village, with a total of 305 households, used an average of eight corvée laborers per day for dispatching and delivering messages. Each person consumed three *sheng* of millet per day, requiring seven *shi* and two *dou* of rice per month. This was the case in every village, resulting in considerable waste of manpower and financial resources. County Head Li and Political Commissar Jia emphasized the importance of rural postal routes and the frequent loss of newspapers and letters in the past. Using the example of Liang Village, they conducted a strict review of the waste of manpower, resolving ideological obstacles among cadres. Starting in late February, the County Head and County Secretary personally led and specifically determined the organization of rural postal routes, integrating it with the mass movement for people's schools and production. In less than half a month, the entire county organized four rural postal trunk lines and nineteen branch lines, employing 22.5 rural postal workers, greatly saving manpower while also speeding up delivery. Newspapers and letters sent from the county can now reach all villages in the county within two days. Recently, all rural postal workers and dispatchers in the county were given three days of intensive training to establish various work systems. (Mei De, Jia He)

　　[Another Report] Heshun Post Office and the district secretarial meeting determined that the district secretary or construction assistant is responsible for leading the rural postal work, while the post office is responsible for business and technical guidance. The district will set up a rural postal main station, and each line will set up branch stations. In the past, one district used 160 laborers throughout the year, but now it only uses 80, reducing the number by half. (Rui Lan)

　　祁县建立乡村邮线两天内报纸到全县
    【本报讯】祁县县长县书亲自推动建立乡村邮线。该县过去采用派差送信办法，梁村共三百零五户，村公所每天平均用支差、送信民夫八人，每人每天吃小米三升，每月需米七石二斗，村村如此，民力、财力的耗费相当巨大。李县长、贾政委提出乡邮线的重要，和过去报纸、信件不断遗失现象，并以梁村的典型实例对耗费民力作了严格检讨，打通了干部思想，二月下旬开始，县长、县书亲自领导，具体确定，组织乡邮线，结合民校群运生产进行。不到半月，全县共组织好乡邮干线四条，支线十九条，乡邮工二十二个半人，大大节省民力同时还加快了速度，从县发出的报纸、信件、两天内就可达到全县所有村庄。近又集训了全县乡邮工和收发员三天，确立各种工作制度。（媚德、嘉禾）
    【又讯】和顺邮局与各区区秘书会议确定区秘书或建设助理员负责领导乡邮工作，邮局负责业务技术指导，区设乡邮总站、各线设分站，一区过去全年用一百六十个劳力，现在只用八十个，减少了一倍。（瑞兰）
