　　Since the start of the Patriotic Self-Defense War, the vast number of workers in our district, in order to support the war and defend the Liberated Areas, have successively launched enthusiastic production increase movements. Especially since this newspaper's "February 7th" editorial called on all factory and mine workers in the district to mobilize, to carry forward the Chinese working class's spirit of hard struggle and heroic dedication, to vigorously develop industrial production, to serve the front lines of the Self-Defense War, and to greet the arrival of the bright future, it has received enthusiastic responses from workers throughout our district. Workers and staff in factories and mines everywhere have launched production competitions one after another, setting off a wave of production increase and merit, automatically setting plans and inspecting products, as well as starting work early and leaving late, automatically adding voluntary labor, not taking sick leave for minor illnesses, and masters and apprentices automatically researching technology together, which has become almost a universal action, and the quality and quantity of products have been greatly improved. For example, a certain unit of the Military Industry Department No. 1 Factory exceeded its task by more than 19 percent in February and 22 percent in March; after the workers in the Sand Casting Department successfully transformed the sand casting technology for large artillery shells, they exceeded the previous production by one time; all the factory workers worked hard for more than twelve hours a day. All the staff and workers of the Military Industry Department proposed to equip a heavy artillery company with voluntary labor and savings contributions and dedicate it to all the commanders and fighters at the front. The workers of the Taihang Military Region Bomb Institute put forward the slogan of "Guaranteeing the satisfaction of the soldiers at the front," which not only ensured that the shell casings were of uniform thickness, but also eliminated problems such as dud explosions and slow explosions, achieving 100 percent effectiveness; the Taihang Second Sub-district Armed Rifle Factory increased production by more than 29 percent, and the quality reached a very high level. This newspaper's printing factory proposed to increase production by 1.56 million characters for the whole month, and the workers of the Erchang Factory of the Daxing Tobacco Company voluntarily contributed labor, with some workers contributing five days of labor every day, proposing to continue contributing until Chiang Kai-shek is defeated... All these movements have yielded great harvests -- the production enthusiasm of the workers and the improvement of quantity and quality have played a great role in supporting the Patriotic Self-Defense War and made great contributions. Here, we pay our respects and extend our cordial greetings to all the workers.

　　Another gain from the workers' movement from this year's "February 7th" to now, which is worth greatly promoting, is the improvement in leadership methods. Everyone has learned the mass line leadership method, which is specifically manifested in: First, being able to adopt mass planning, mass inspection, and mass research to concentrate mass wisdom to deploy and promote production work. For example, Military Industry Department No. 1 Factory organized a technical research association, organized all the veteran workers, discussed production deployment and researched technology at the beginning of each month; inspected production in the first half of the month in the middle of the month and discussed how to overcome the shortcomings in the first half of the month. The opinions of these veteran worker comrades increased their sense of responsibility and enabled their experience and creativity to be brought into play. Collective research on technology overcame the difficulties in finding technical education talents for all materials due to the complexity of the factory's production objects, and exchanged experience with each other, improved technical learning, and excited everyone's emotions. First, cadres took the lead in combining with the masses. For example, when the Taihang Second Sub-district Armed Factory formulated a plan, cadres and activists first set an example, and the cadres' plans were reviewed and approved by the masses. The plan of the workshop director was finalized after the masses gave their opinions three times. For example, the masses proposed "fair delivery, problems should be raised, and the attitude should be good," etc., and the masses were very satisfied after the plan was formulated. After discussing this newspaper's "February 7th" editorial, the cadres of the Erchang Factory of the Daxing Tobacco Company first formulated their own plans to improve their work and leadership. The comrades of the Engineering Section and the Materials Section formulated plans based on the opinions of the masses on how the Engineering Section should arrange and inspect production in a timely manner, how to help a certain department overcome shortcomings, and the Materials Section should ensure the timely supply of materials, etc., and published them on the bulletin board and inspected them regularly, and the movement was enthusiastically launched. Third, commend typical examples and achievements, promote new heroism, encourage progress and promote backwardness, and no achievement or advantage is buried. With this leadership method, everyone can make contributions, everyone can be a hero, which inspires the masses' emotions. For example, after a certain factory commended two comrades who had not been active in the movement for some progress, it encouraged more than 20 inactive workers, who said: "We can also be activists!" Therefore, they actively participated in the movement. Various factories have also created methods of commending heroes and models, such as radio stations, bulletin boards, hero lists, and sending winning flags, which not only enabled individual inactive people who had opinions and low morale about their work in the past to overcome and transform, but also entered the wave of increasing production and making contributions with high morale. Under such correct leadership methods, everyone has generally carried out current affairs education, improved the masses' awareness, encouraged confidence in victory and determination to overcome difficulties. Many factory workers have proposed that in order to defeat Chiang Kai-shek as soon as possible, it is necessary to restore the difficult style of 1943, automatically reduce the standard of living, and know that today's large-scale production is one of the important tasks of carrying out a large-scale emancipation movement and defeating the dark rule of Chiang Kai-shek's four major families.

　　The policy of mutual benefit between labor and capital and cooperation between labor and capital has been well implemented in many factories. The Pengcheng Ceramics workers voluntarily reduced their wages for the development of the ceramics industry; the workers of some small textile factories in Changzhi helped the factories sell their finished products, and the factories provided funds to help organize textile and sideline production for the workers' families, helping the workers solve their families' difficulties; and many factories have established labor-capital profit sharing and reward methods, which increased the spirit of cooperation and increased morale.

　　All the above gains are a great progress in the industrial production and construction of our region. This is mainly due to the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and the Central Bureau, which has enabled us to implement the mass line and the policy of labor-capital cooperation, and has improved the enthusiasm for defending the Liberated Areas and supporting the front lines. But we should not be complacent about this. There are still individual factories and individual departments, or some problems that have not been handled well, and we must continue to work hard to implement them. Factories that have not launched the production increase and merit campaign, or factories where the campaign is not well carried out, should become more active to make the production increase and merit campaign more in-depth and universal, and to further improve the existing achievements and experience. Today is "May Day," and we should consolidate our achievements, review the past, promote our existing experience, and not be arrogant or complacent in commemorating our festival. We must give greater play to the revolutionary spirit of our working class so that we can add more merits in the Patriotic Self-Defense War in order to defeat Chiang Kai-shek as soon as possible!

　　纪念“五一”继续扩大增产立功运动
    爱国自卫战争开始以来，我区广大的职工群众，为了支援战争保卫解放区陆续地展开了热烈的增产运动，尤其自本报“二七”社论号召全区工厂矿山职员工人动员起来，发扬中国工人阶级艰苦奋斗、英勇献身的精神，努力发展工业生产，为自卫战争的前线服务，迎接光明到来后，得到我全区职工的热烈响应，各地工厂矿山工人和职员们，都纷纷展开了生产竞赛，先后掀起了增产立功的热潮，自动订计划与检查出品，以及早上工迟下工，自动加义务工、轻病不请假，师徒自动互相研究技术等等，几乎成了普遍行动，产品的质量和数量大为提高。如军工部一厂某部二月份超过任务百分之十九强，三月份超过任务百分之二十二；翻砂部工人改造大炮弹的翻砂技术成功之后，超过了以往生产一倍；全厂职工每日紧张的作工到十二小时以上。军工部全体职工提出以义务劳动、节约献金，装备了一个重炮连献给前方全体指战员。太行军区炸弹所工人提出“保证前方战士满意”的口号，不仅作到了弹壳厚薄均匀，而且消灭了空炸、慢炸等毛病，达到了百分之百的效力；太行二分区分武枪厂，生产量超过了百分之二十九，质量达到极高的水平。本报印刷厂提出全月增产一百五十六万字，大兴烟草公司二厂工人自动献工，有的工友每日献工五天，提出一直献到打垮蒋介石……。所有这些运动的收获——职工们的生产热情与数质量的提高，在支援爱国自卫战争上都已起了很大作用，供献极大，在此特向全体职工们致以敬礼和亲切的慰问。
    从今年“二七”到现在职工运动的另一收获，值得我们大大发扬的是领导方法上的提高，大家学会了群众路线的领导方法，具体表现在：第一是能够采用了群众计划、群众检查、群众研究，集中群众智慧来布置与推动生产工作。如军工部一厂组织了技术研究会，把老工人都组织起来，每月初讨论生产布置及研究技术；月中检查上半月生产及讨论如何克服上半月存在的缺点。这些老工人同志参加意见，增加了他们的责任心，使他们的经验和创造得以发扬。集体研究技术并克服了工厂生产对象复杂，找不到全材的技术教育人材的困难，并且互相交换了经验，提高了技术的学习，兴奋了大家情绪。第一是干部带头结合群众。如太行二分区分武装厂订计划，首由干部积极分子起模范，而且干部的计划都经过群众的审查和批准，工务长的计划经过群众三次提意见才订好。如群众提出“交活时要公平，有毛病要提出来，态度要好”等等，订出后群众很满意。大兴烟草公司二厂讨论了本报“二七”社论后，干部首先订出自己提高工作，提高领导的计划，工务科、材料科同志根据群众的意见，订出了工务科如何及时布置与检查生产，如何帮助某一部克服缺点，材料科保证材料供给及时等，并在墙报上公布、定期检查，运动热烈展开了。第三是表扬典型和成绩，发扬新英雄主义鼓励前进推动落后，一点成绩与有优点都不埋没。这种领导方法，人人都可立功，人人都可当英雄，鼓舞了群众情绪的昂扬。如某工厂对两个一向不够积极的同志在运动中一些进步予以表扬后，鼓动了二十多个不积极的工人，他们说：“咱们也能当积极分子了！”因而积极参加了运动。各工厂并创造了广播台、墙报、英雄榜以及送优胜旗等等表扬英雄、表扬模范的方法，不仅使过去对工作有意见、情绪不高的个别不积极的人克服转变了，而且都情绪很高涨的进入为增产立功的浪潮中。在这样正确领导方法之下，大家又普遍的进行了时事教育，提高了群众觉悟，鼓励了胜利信心和克服困难的决心，有好些工厂工人提出为了早日打垮蒋介石要恢复四三年的艰苦作风，自动降低了生活水平，知道了今天大生产就是进行大翻身运动，就是要打垮蒋介石四大家族的黑暗统治的重要工作之一。
    劳资两利，劳资合作的方针，已在不少工厂很好的贯彻了。彭城磁业工人，为了磁业发展，自动减低工资；长治一些小纺织厂的工友，都帮助厂方推销成品，厂方拿出资金帮助组织工人家属纺织及副业生产，帮助工人解决了家属困难；并有许多工厂建立了劳资分红和奖励办法，使合作精神增加，情绪愈益提高。
    所有以上这些收获，在我区工业生产建设上是一个很大的进步。这主要是由党中央和中央局领导的正确，使我们执行了群众路线和劳资合作方针，提高了保卫解放区支援前线的积极性。但我们不应以此自满，还有个别工厂，个别部门，或在某些问题上没有搞好，还须继续努力，以求贯彻。增产立功运动没有发动起来的工厂，或运动开展不好的工厂还要更加积极起来，使增产立功运动更加深入和普遍，已有的成绩和经验更加提高。今天是“五一”劳动节，我们纪念自己的节日要巩固成绩，检讨过去，发扬已有经验，不骄傲不自满，要更大的发挥我们工人阶级的革命精神，使我们在爱国自卫战争中能够功上再加功，以求早日打败蒋介石！
