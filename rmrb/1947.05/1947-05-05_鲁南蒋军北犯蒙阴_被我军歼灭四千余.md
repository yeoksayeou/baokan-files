Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 3rd (delayed dispatch): A unit of the East China People's Liberation Army annihilated over 4,000 Chiang Kai-shek troops who invaded Mengyin in six days and nights, echoing the annihilation of three enemy brigades in the Battle of Tai'an. The Chiang Kai-shek troops invading Mengyin from Linyi and Feixian consisted of eight brigades from the 25th Division, 74th Division, and 65th Division. The People's Liberation Army met them head-on at the eastern foot of Mengshan Mountain, which stretches for a hundred miles, at dawn on the 22nd, and the battle was extremely fierce. During the battle for the peaks near Daye, the Chiang Kai-shek 25th Division used dozens of mountain guns, heavy mortars, multiple aircraft, and five tanks for cover, and also employed American-style flamethrowers to launch fierce attacks. A marksman of the People's Liberation Army fiercely counterattacked, hitting the enemy ranks with seven shells, assisting the infantry in bravely repelling the enemy. By the 25th, the position remained firmly in our hands.
Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 2nd: The Chiang Kai-shek troops invading Binan and occupying the Lin(yi)-Qing(kou) highway were harassed and blocked by the military and civilians of the Binan area. Within five days (April 14th to 18th), over 260 people were killed or captured. Currently, apart from the isolated stronghold of Guandunbu, there are no major enemy forces in the vast area south of the Lin(yi)-Qing(kou) highway, north of the Longhai Railway, and east of the Shu River.
Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 3rd: Wei Laiguo, a widely renowned shooting hero and company commander of a certain unit of the East China People's Liberation Army, killed 92 enemies with 136 bullets in the areas of Baimaguan and Tiantaishan, 40 li west of Mengyin, on the 20th and 21st of last month, resisting the invading 118th Brigade of the Chiang Kai-shek 11th Division. On the night of the 21st, Company Commander Wei was again ordered to counterattack the enemy occupying Tiantaishan and was gloriously wounded. When he arrived at the rear hospital, he firmly stated that he would return to the front lines to kill more enemies after he recovered. The unit's leaders sent a letter of condolence upon hearing the news.
Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 2nd: For half a month, Chiang Kai-shek warships have been harassing the ports of Yantai, Weihai, Longkou, and Shidao every day with one or two ships, disrupting fishermen's fishing activities, acting like pirates. Following the shelling of Weihai on the 20th, at 8 a.m. on the 22nd, a Chiang Kai-shek warship fired over 80 shells at Longkou City, injuring 15 civilians. On the 23rd, the Chiang Kai-shek warship "Feixiang" chased and captured the Yanshi "Shengan," "Yanzi," and "Fusheng" fishing boats outside the Zhifu Island port, firing over 60 shells. The "Shengan," fully loaded with over 500 boxes of fresh fish, was seized. Fishery groups and maritime unions in Yantai City have lodged a serious protest and called on all sailors and fishermen to heighten their vigilance.
Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 2nd: More than 1,000 militiamen from the three counties of Shu(yang), Guan(yun), and Dong(hai) in northern Jiangsu launched a counterattack on the Chaimihe River on April 16th, once cutting off the Shuyang-Dayishan highway, powerfully cooperating with the People's Liberation Army's offensive on the Huai(yin)-Shu(yang) highway. The next day, a part of the Chiang Kai-shek 44th Division, in coordination with about 500 local Chiang Kai-shek puppets, came out to harass, and were attacked by militiamen everywhere. The militiamen of Machang District in Shuyang achieved the glorious feat of capturing two small cannons, one heavy machine gun, and over 40 rifles. On the night of the 19th, the Donghai militiamen launched a three-pronged attack on the Nangang stronghold on the Shuyang-Dayishan highway, burning down bunkers and barricades, and capturing four villages including Xigang. The militiamen of the three counties fought 13 battles in 13 days from April 7th to 19th, annihilating 143 Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops.
Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 2nd: During the Dazhongji Campaign, thousands of militiamen from Dongtaibei bravely participated in the battle, capturing 280 Chiang Kai-shek puppets who were fleeing. Militiamen Xu Linwang and three others led the way for the troops, rushing into the streets first. Seeing several Chiang Kai-shek soldiers lying in ambush inside fortifications, the four of them shouted "Capture them alive!" and rushed up empty-handed, grabbing the Chiang Kai-shek soldiers' Thompson machine guns and desperately wresting them away. The Chiang Kai-shek soldiers pulled the guns and jumped into the river, and the four also jumped into the river and wrestled with the enemy. The Chiang Kai-shek soldiers stabbed wildly with bayonets, and the four's arms were bleeding profusely, but they finally seized the Thompson machine guns and three 38-style rifles. Chen Silin, a militiaman from × town, captured two long guns and eight members of the "Returning Home Corps" by himself. Five militiamen from × township captured over twenty Chiang Kai-shek soldiers alive, seizing one rifle and over fifty rows of bullets.
