　　Plant Early and Grow Well
    Zhao Zhengkui's Planted Cotton Seedlings Have All Emerged
    [This newspaper, PingShun News] The 29th district of the Fifth Region convened a meeting of production directors and labor heroes to specifically study planting during the drought. The masses all harbored the idea of waiting for rain, and only two villages were carrying water to plant seedlings. Zhao Zhengkui of Shangzhuang Village planted his cotton eight days after Qingming Festival, and now all the seedlings have emerged. This has greatly increased everyone's confidence in planting. Three slogans were immediately put forward: "Waiting for rain is not as good as seizing the time to plant per mu," "Early planting yields a harvest, late planting yields nothing," and "Planting cotton is clothing; without planting, there is nothing to wear." After everyone discussed this, they all said to mobilize all and semi-labor forces to carry water and make a concentrated effort to plant. They will definitely finish planting cotton before the 5th. After the meeting, children in their teens and old men and women in their sixties and seventies from various villages went to the fields to plant, ensuring that the seedlings were caught and that not a single seedling was missing. Six people were also selected as a district-wide inspection team to specifically inspect cotton planting techniques, ensuring that seedlings emerge and that cotton planting is completed on schedule.

　　种得早长得好
    赵正魁点的棉苗已出全
    【本报平顺讯】五区二十九号召开生产主任、劳动英雄会议，专研究天旱突击下种。群众都存在等雨思想，只有两个村是担水栽花。上庄村赵正魁，清明后八天种上的花，现在全苗都出来，这对大家点种信心提高甚大，当即提出三个口号：“等雨不如抢垧”，“早种能得，迟不收”，“种棉是衣裳，不种穿不上”。经大家讨论后，都说发动全半劳力，担抬水突击点种，五号以前一定种完花。会后各村十来岁的儿童，六、七十的老汉、妇女，都下地栽种，保证捉住苗，一苗不缺。又选了六人为全区突击检查组，专检查种棉技术，保证出来苗，按期完成种棉。（海忠）
