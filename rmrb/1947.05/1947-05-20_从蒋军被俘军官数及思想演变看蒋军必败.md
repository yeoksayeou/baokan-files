	Viewing the Inevitable Defeat of the Chiang Kai-shek Army from the Number of Captured Chiang Army Officers and the Evolution of Their Thinking

	In the eight months of the Patriotic Self-Defense War from July of last year to February of this year, the Central China battlefield alone has captured six lieutenant generals and twenty-seven major generals from Chiang Kai-shek's regular army. (Note: In the list of captured Chiang army generals previously announced by Yan'an Headquarters, Mai Xiachong, deputy brigade commander of the 187th Brigade of the 65th Division, Liang Fengde, chief of staff of the 99th Brigade of the 69th Division, Tian Yuncong, deputy brigade commander of the New 7th Brigade of the 21st Division, Wang Kun, deputy brigade commander of the 114th Brigade of the 51st Division, and Niu Ben, chief of staff of the 26th Division, were all colonels, not major generals.) Among them, one lieutenant general and eight major generals were captured in the six months from July to December of last year. Five lieutenant generals and nineteen major generals were captured in the two months of January and February of this year. Comparing these figures, it can be seen that in the latter stage, in only one-third of the time of the former stage, the number of captured Chiang army senior officers increased sharply to two and two-thirds times. Furthermore, according to incomplete statistics from two teams of the Shandong Military Region's Releasing Chiang Army Senior Officer Group, from July to October of last year, during the seven victories in seven battles in Central Jiangsu, 35 percent of the captured Chiang army officers concealed their class background, 45 percent concealed their names and backgrounds, and 48 percent concealed their education and party affiliation. In December, among the Chiang army officers captured in the Subei Campaign, 30 percent still concealed their class background, names, and backgrounds, and 35 percent concealed their education and party affiliation. However, by January of this year, among the Chiang army officers captured in the Lunan Campaign, the number concealing their class background had sharply decreased to 22 percent, those concealing their names and backgrounds to 20 percent, and those concealing their education and party affiliation to slightly less than 25 percent. Finally, observing the ideological evolution of Chiang army officers captured in various battles: Liu Yi, commander of the 274th Regiment of the 92nd Brigade of the 69th Division of the Chiang army, who was captured in the Chaoyangji Campaign in northern Anhui at the end of July last year, had the mindset of "preparing to die" at the time. Five months later (December), the brigade and regimental commanders of the 69th Division captured in the Subei Campaign generally reflected: "Commanding the civil war is not as good as being a prisoner of war; at least there is hope of returning home." By January of this year, after Zhou Yuying, lieutenant general and commander of the 51st Division of the Chiang army, was captured in the battle to recover Zaozhuang, he pointed to his new clothes and said with a smile to the liaison department personnel of the People's Liberation Army: "I knew I was going to be liberated, so I put on new clothes that I had never worn before." In late February, Chen Jiong, major general and deputy brigade commander of the 175th Brigade of the 46th Division of the Chiang army, who was captured in the Laiwu Campaign, told reporters: "Today, not only soldiers and lower and middle-ranking officers in the Chiang army are war-weary, but even I, as a deputy brigade commander, led a battalion of armed forces before being captured, but I voluntarily handed over my pistol and ordered the entire battalion to lay down their weapons." The above materials prove the success of the People's Liberation Army's correct implementation of its policy on prisoners of war, and that the low morale and pessimistic mood of the Chiang army have spread to the highest-ranking officers. Furthermore, according to a Shanghai airmail dispatch in the Chongqing Democracy Daily on January 29th, a certain chief of staff of a Chiang army brigade said: "In reality, our middle-ranking and even general-level officers are very pessimistic." With Chiang Kai-shek facing such a profound military crisis, his defeat is inevitable.

　　从蒋军被俘军官数及思想演变看蒋军必败
    新华社华东前线记者  洪流
    自去年七月至今年二月八个月的爱国自卫战争中，华中战场就俘之蒋正规军高级军官已有中将六员、少将二十七员。（按：延安总部前公布俘虏蒋军将官名单中，六五师一八七旅副旅长麦霞冲、六九师九九旅参谋长梁凤德、二十一师新七旅副旅长田云从、五一师一一四旅副旅长王昆、二十六师参谋长牛奔等五氏均为上校，非少将。）其中中将一员，少将八员，为去年七月至十二月六个月内俘虏者。中将五员少将十九员，为今年一二两月所俘获者。如此比较，可看出后一阶段仅以前一阶段三分之一时间，而俘获蒋军高级军官则激增至二又三分之二倍。再根据山东军区解放蒋军高级军官团两个队不完全统计，去年七月至十月，苏中七战七捷时，被俘蒋军军官有百分之三十五隐瞒阶级，百分之四十五隐瞒姓名、履历，百分之四十八隐瞒学历、党派。十二月，宿北战役被俘蒋军军官，仍有百分之三十隐瞒阶级、姓名履历，百分之三十五隐瞒学历、党派。但至今年一月，鲁南战役被俘蒋军军官中其隐瞒阶级者，即锐减至百分之二十二，隐瞒姓名、履历者百分之二十，隐瞒学历、党派者百分之二十五弱。最后从历次战役俘获蒋军军官的思想演变观察：去年七月底，淮北朝阳集战役被俘之蒋军六九师九二旅二七四团团长刘毅军，当时的思想情况是：“准备死”。五个月后（十二月），宿北战役被俘的六九师旅、团长普遍反映：“指挥打内战不如当俘虏，还有回家希望。”至今年一月，收复枣庄之役，蒋军五一师师长周毓英中将被俘后，指着身上新衣笑对解放军联络部人员说：“我知道我将要解放，所以穿上从未穿过的新衣。”二月下旬，莱芜战役被俘之蒋军四六师一七五旅副旅长陈炯少将告记者：“今天蒋军中不光士兵和中下级军官厌战，即是我副旅长，在被俘前尚率领一营武装，但我自动先把手枪缴了，下命令一营人全部放下武器。”从以上材料中，证明人民解放军正确执行俘虏政策的成功，及蒋军士气低落，悲观情绪已传染至最高级军官中间。又据一月二十九日渝民主报上海航讯透露：蒋军某旅参谋长谈：“实实在在我们中级乃至将级军官都很悲观。”蒋介石面临着如此深重的军事危机，其失败是必然的。
