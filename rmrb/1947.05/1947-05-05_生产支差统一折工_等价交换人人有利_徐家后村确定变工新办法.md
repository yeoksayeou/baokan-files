　　Unified Production Labor Conversion, Equivalent Exchange Benefits Everyone
    Xujiahou Village Determines New Labor Exchange Method
    [This Newspaper, Huguan News] Xujiahou Village, Huguan Third District, in resolving the contradiction between supporting the war effort and production, has formulated the following labor exchange methods based on last year's experience in combining agriculture and sideline occupations: 1. Regarding support for the war effort, the principle is overall assignment and individual dispatch, with unified accounting for agriculture but flexible recording. The entire village has a total of 128 able-bodied laborers (including 18 who are engaged in business or working in factories outside the village, who cannot support the war effort but pay for support labor in grain according to the mutual aid team's wage, at six catties per work point, distributed equally to the village's support labor), 38 head of livestock (each head equivalent to two laborers), and 34 semi-able-bodied laborers, totaling the equivalent of 311 full laborers. In the spring, the entire village plans to dispatch 1,550 support labor days (each support labor day equivalent to one work point in agriculture), with an average of five support labor days assigned to each laborer. After dispatch, the logistics committee assigns support labor according to the amount of labor in each mutual aid team. When keeping accounts within the mutual aid team, five support labor days are deducted from each laborer's account. 2. Regarding sideline occupations, after specific calculations by the mutual aid team, surplus labor is extracted to organize transportation. The land of those who go out for transportation is cultivated by everyone. Those who go out for transportation are credited work points based on the amount of weight carried, the distance traveled, and the amount of money earned, not based on daily work points. This can improve the enthusiasm for production. The small cooperative issues work tickets. Spinning involves receiving raw materials from the small cooperative, turning thread into cloth, and crediting work points based on the quality and quantity of the finished product, which are issued in the same way as in agriculture. Carpenters, barbers, and other workers hand over their earned wages to the small cooperative, and work points are credited based on skill level and the amount of money earned, which are issued in the same way as in agriculture. Thus, agriculture, sideline occupations, and support for the war effort are combined, with only one type of work ticket. Finally, after deducting 20% of the profits from sideline occupations for capital dividends, all the work tickets of the families participating in sideline occupations are added together. After deducting the actual work used by each family for farming, the remainder is surplus labor. All the profits from sideline occupations are distributed proportionally to surplus labor, with those with more surplus labor receiving more, those with less receiving less, and those with no surplus labor receiving nothing. This encourages the masses of all ages to actively engage in production and strive for more surplus labor to receive a larger share. 3. Standards for calculating and converting work points: In agriculture, each full laborer is counted as five *xiang* per day, with flexible work point conversion (according to the distance from the field, four loads of manure are defined as one *xiang*, with more or less conversion accordingly). In transportation and support for the war effort, carrying 60 catties of weight for 60 *li* is equivalent to six *xiang* in agriculture. Spinning top-quality thread is equivalent to 12 *xiang* of agricultural work per catty, while spinning general thread is equivalent to 10 *xiang* per catty. Weaving top-quality cloth with top-quality thread earns five *xiang* of agricultural work for every six *chi*, while second-quality cloth earns four *xiang*. Weaving top-quality cloth with second-quality thread earns five *xiang* of agricultural work for every five *chi* (because second-quality thread is more difficult to weave than top-quality thread), while second-quality cloth earns four *xiang*. Carpenters earn seven *xiang* of agricultural work for every 13 catties of rice earned (carpenters can currently earn 13 catties of rice per day, while one work point in agriculture is five *xiang*. Because they are skilled workers, their tool costs are considered, giving them the equivalent of seven *xiang*). The masses believe this unified method of calculating and converting work points is very good. For example, carpenter Li Er said: "If you ask me to work in the fields, I can't match a full laborer, but if I do carpentry, I'm worth seven *xiang*. I'm not afraid of the difficulty of not being able to farm, and I can still share in the entire sideline occupation profits. This way, I won't earn less, and I can even earn more!" At the same time, it overcomes the difficulties of families without male laborers being unable to farm and being unable to afford wages, because women can also match men's labor. After this experiment, it has indeed promoted production. Men and women, young and old, all participate in mutual aid, striving for one more surplus work point to receive a larger share, and those who go out to support the war effort are also at ease, not afraid of being unable to farm, and able to earn work points and share in profits. The logistics committee also finds it easier to dispatch support labor, and everyone feels that supporting the war effort is fair. (Zhixian)

　　生产支差统一折工  等价交换人人有利
    徐家后村确定变工新办法
    【本报壶关讯】壶关三区徐家后村，解决支差参战和生产的矛盾问题上，依据去年农副业结合经验，定出如下变工办法：一、在支差上是总派零支，与农业统一死分活记。全村共有全劳力一百二十八名（内有在外经商与在工厂作工者十八名，不能支差，但按互助组工资出支差米，每工六斤，平均分给本村支差劳力），畜力三十八头（每头折两个劳力），有半劳力三十四个，以上共合全劳力三百一十一个。春季全村预派差一千五百五十个（每差与农业上一个工同），每个劳力平均派五差，派出后由后勤委员，按各互助队的劳力多少，照差派支；互助队内记账时，在每个劳力名下扣除五个支差工。二、在副业上，互助队经具体计算后，抽出剩余劳力，组织运输；出去运输之人，家中的地由大家来种；他出去运输是按负重多少，路程远近，赚钱多少折工，不是按日折工，这样可以提高生产积极性，由小型合作社发给工票。纺织是领取小型合作社的原料交线成布，按成品好坏多少折工后与农业一样的发给工票。木匠、剃头等工人将所赚工资交到小型合作社，按技术高低，赚钱多少，折工后与农业一样的发给工票，这样农副业支差结合，只有一种工票。最后将副业上的一切红利除去百分之廿资金分红外，再把参加副业各家的所有工票加在一起，除去各家的农业种地实用工外，就是剩余工，统一按剩余工将副业上的所有红利按工分得，剩工多的多分，少的少分，没有剩工的不分，这样奖励各家老少群众都积极生产，争取剩余工。三、计工折工标准：农业上，每个全劳力一天以五晌计，按活折工（按离地远近规定挑粪四担为一晌，多挑多折，少挑少折）。运输与支差上以负重六十斤，行程六十里顶农业上六晌。纺特等线一斤，顶农业工十二晌，一般线子纺一斤顶十晌，织布领头等线交头等布，每六尺折农业五晌，二等布顶四晌工。领二等线交头等布，每五尺顶农业上五晌（因比头等线子难织），交二等布的顶四晌。木匠工人每赚十三斤米顶农业上七晌（按现在木匠每天可赚米十三斤，农业上一工是五晌。因他是技术工人，所以照顾到他的工具问题，给他顶七晌），这种统一的计工折工办法，群众认为很好。如木匠李二则说：“要叫我上地我还顶不住一个全劳力，但我作木工就顶七晌，我不怕种不上地的困难，还能分得整个副业上的红利，这样我也不少赚钱，还能多赚哩。”同时也克服了家无男劳力种不上地与出不起工资的困难，因为女人也能顶男人工。经过这样试验，对生产上确实有推动，在家生产的男女老少都参加了互助，争取多一个余工多分一份红，出去支差参战的人也安心，不怕种不上地，又能顶工分红利，后勤委员派差也感容易，大家支差也感公道了。（志献）
