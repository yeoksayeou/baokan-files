Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, May 26th: Student movements in various parts of the Chiang-controlled areas are still expanding and developing extensively, and are tending to combine with the masses of citizens. According to a report by the Central News Agency: Nankai students in Tianjin who went on strike continued on the 25th to go to factories and schools in Tianjin in more than a dozen teams to promote anti-civil war and anti-hunger, and performed dramas such as "Triumph" and "Ten Thousand Yuan Bills" for citizens. Students from major universities and middle schools in Shanghai also issued notices in the name of the "May 20th Massacre" Support Association, forming propaganda teams to go to various districts to promote speeches, post slogans along the way, and distribute leaflets, calling for a "June 2nd" strike of students, workers, and merchants. Chiang Kai-shek's police in Shanghai frantically suppressed and arrested them on a large scale. On the 25th alone, the Huangpu Police Department arrested 12 students on Jiangxi Road and Henan Road, 22 students on Middle-Zheng Road Bund, and 21 students on Guangdong Road Bund. The Lao Zha Police Department arrested 14 students at the intersection of Zhifu Road and Xizang Road, and 13 students on Beijing Road and Fujian Road. A total of 82 students were arrested on that day. The "May 20th" Massacre Support Association has lodged a serious protest with the Chiang Kai-shek government, demanding the release of the arrested students, the severe punishment of the murderers, responsibility for the medical expenses of the injured students, and guarantees that similar incidents will not happen again, and set a deadline of 24 hours to respond, otherwise, a demonstration will be held. According to news from Chongqing: The Chongqing National Women's Normal College has been on strike since the 24th to support the "May 20th" blood case, and resolved to respond to the "June 2nd" anti-civil war strike. From now on, representatives will be sent to Shapingba to contact various schools to organize a general strike in Chongqing.
Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, May 26th: The newspapers in Peiping and Tianjin revealed that when the students of Peking University went on strike, they put forward six demands: (1) Immediately stop the civil war and oppose unification by force; (2) Liquidate bureaucratic capital and thoroughly investigate economic organs; (3) Increase education funds; (4) Restore the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference; (5) Stop conscription and grain requisition; (6) Implement the four promises and guarantee human rights and freedom. The anti-civil war wall newspaper on the "Democracy Book" of Peking University stated: "If the truce is not allowed, the strike will not end." The slogans of the propaganda team of Tsinghua University put forward: "People who don't want to starve to death, unite." Furthermore, the propaganda teams of Tsinghua, Peking University, and Beiyang University were brutally beaten by a unit of the 208th Regiment of Chiang Kai-shek's Youth Army near Xidan Archway on the 18th, and more than 40 students were injured. Another unit of the Youth Army broke into Yenching University to make trouble. On the same day, an incident of Chiang Kai-shek's army beating students also occurred in Zhongshan Park in Beiping. On that day, more than 20 students were missing, and Deng Xiao, a student from Peking University who was beaten, lost his sight in both eyes. On the 20th, when more than 10,000 middle school and university students marched in Beiping, Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents and thugs acted even more fiercely. When the marching students arrived at Xidan, a student from Beiyang University was surrounded by thugs, tied up on the building, and severely injured. Representatives from Tangshan Institute of Technology were kidnapped by three armed secret agents, and several students from Tsinghua University were also missing. However, fair-minded professors from various schools, regardless of all kinds of pressure, openly sympathized with and supported the students. More than 80 professors from Tsinghua University jointly wrote to the school's strike committee, saying: The students of our school are on strike against the civil war and hunger, and Tong Da and others express sympathy for this solemn action and are willing to work hard for peace and democracy. More than 60 professors from Nankai University also expressed the same view. Professors from Beiyang University donated more than one million yuan to support the anti-civil war movement. Professor Yang Rengeng from Peking University told the students: "If you want to strike, strike for anti-civil war."
