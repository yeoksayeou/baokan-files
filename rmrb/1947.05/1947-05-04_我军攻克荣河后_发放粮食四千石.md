Our Army Distributes 4,000 Shi of Grain After Capturing Ronghe

[This newspaper's Taiyue Front, 2nd dispatch] After the People's Liberation Army captured Ronghe, it completely returned the more than 4,000 shi of grain from the six major warehouses that the puppet county chief Li Xushou and puppet regiment commander Xue Zidong had plundered from the peasants to the local farmers. From the 13th onwards, men and women, old and young, from all over the county, came from dozens of miles away, driving carts, pushing wheelbarrows, and carrying sacks to collect the grain. Chiang's aircraft constantly bombed along the way, but even this could not stop them.

    放粮食四千石
    【本报太岳前线二日电】人民解放军攻克荣河后，已将城内伪县长李绪守、伪团长薛子栋刮目农民的六大仓库四千余石粮食完全归还当地农民。十三日起，全县男女老少均从数十里外赶着大车、推着手车、背着口袋拥来领粮。蒋机不断沿途轰炸，但亦不能阻止。
