Jilu Yu No. 8 Administrative Office
Establishes Bank Credit Loan Office
    [Our newspaper's report from Jilu Yu on the 2nd] The No. 8 Administrative Office and the banks of various county governments attach great importance to this year's production loans. In order to ensure that this year's production loans truly reach the hands of the basic masses, 20 bank credit loan offices have been established throughout the region. It is estimated that 100 million yuan of production loans can be issued to 15,000 to 20,000 laborers before the spring plowing. According to a survey in Qingfeng: District 10 has supported more than 100 blacksmith workers in the loan process, adding 34 new blacksmith furnaces. Each person can make one hoe per day, selling for 6,000 yuan. Not only can each one earn 3,000 yuan, but it also facilitates farming for the peasants.
    Furthermore: After this loan, Yanggu Chengguan added more than 1,000 spinning wheels, and the buzzing sound can be heard day and night, demonstrating the unprecedented high level of enthusiasm for production among the masses.

　　冀鲁豫八专署
    成立银行信用贷款所
    【本报冀鲁豫二日电】八专署及各县政府银行，对今年生产贷款异常重视，为使今年生产贷款真正贷到基本群众手中，已在全区成立银行信用借贷所二十处。估计一万万元的生产贷款，春耕前即可贷给一万五至二万劳动人民之手。据清丰调查：第十区在贷款中就扶植了铁匠工人一百多名，新增加铁匠炉三十四座，每人每天打镢一把，卖价六千元，不但每把可赚三千元，且便利了农民耕种。
    又讯：阳谷城关经这次贷款后，增加纺花车千余辆，昼夜能闻嗡嗡之声，表现了群众生产情绪空前高涨。
