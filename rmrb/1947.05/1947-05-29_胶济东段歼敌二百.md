Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 27th: The Menglianggu victory shocked the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops entrenched in the eastern section of the Jiaoji Railway. The Chiang Kai-shek's 8th Army in Jiaoxian County has been frantically adjusting its defenses in recent days. A unit of more than 1,000 men from the Chiang Kai-shek puppet police 2nd Brigade in Jimo launched a probing attack northeast in three routes at dawn on the 21st, and was blocked by local militia at every turn. They fled back at 2 PM. A unit of the East China People's Liberation Army pursued the enemy fiercely to Heshangzhuang, more than ten miles north of Jimo City. After a fierce battle, the enemy was completely defeated, killing or wounding more than 200 enemies, including a regimental commander. Twelve enemies below the platoon leader level were captured alive, and eight rifles and more than 2,000 rounds of ammunition were seized. On the morning of the 22nd, another unit of the People's Liberation Army ambushed on the highway from Nanquan to Lancun (both on the Jiaoji Railway line), intercepted a large truck, captured seven Chiang Kai-shek soldiers below the platoon leader level, and seized four short guns.
