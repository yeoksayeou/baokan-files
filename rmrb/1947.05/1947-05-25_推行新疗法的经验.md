Experiences in Promoting New Therapies
    Qian Xinzhong
   "Daily dressing changes, becoming stubborn wounds, not healing for years." This detour has been taken by many doctors, tasted by wounded comrades, and become a habit, with no one objecting; the wounded want the doctors to care a little more about them to feel at ease. Changing dressings is the most practical manifestation of doctors' care for the wounded, regardless of whether it is reasonable or not, somewhat satisfying both sides. The new therapy emerged by breaking through this habit and unreasonable dressing change system. The following is an introduction to the experiences in promoting new therapies, as a starting point for further research.
    I. No Objection to Not Changing Dressings When the Wound Doesn't Hurt
    When starting to promote the new therapy, doctors were not used to it, and the wounded were unwilling to stop changing dressings. The only way to overcome this difficulty is to: improve doctors' treatment ability for the wounded, establish a good influence among the wounded with a loyal and responsible attitude, and conduct publicity and education on the new therapy; tell them not to change dressings when it doesn't hurt, and ask the doctor to check when it hurts, as arbitrary dressing changes will ruin things, etc. The biggest hope of the wounded is that the wound does not hurt, so the promotion of the new therapy basically needs to build faith in the work. If the medicine is changed well, the wound is treated correctly, no infection occurs, and the wound does not hurt, the wounded have no objection.
    II. Seize the Opportunity to Focus on Medical Treatment on the First Day and First Week
    If the wound receives perfect treatment within six to twelve hours of injury on the first day, there will be less pus; because the bacteria have not yet gained a foothold, the doctor will excise or apply sulfonamides to limit their activity, and the wound will quickly overcome the bacteria. This is the reason for no pus formation.
    The wound changes the most and fastest in the first week, and the following points should be grasped for concentrated treatment: 1. Quietness of the wounded and the limbs. 2. Adequate water, adequate sleep, and adequate nutrition. 3. Determine the treatment plan after judging the injury. 4. Thoughtful care. 5. Classify injuries and establish various treatment organizations, striving to be worthy of the name.
    III. Dressing Change Principles
    Change when necessary, and don't change when unnecessary. Mechanical changes every few days and daily changes are not appropriate. Advocate a responsible attitude and change the dressing according to the needs of the wound. For wounds without pus, swelling, or pain, rest steadily and only check once a day, do not change the dressing. If there is pus that cannot come out, or continuous pus discharge, it should be cut open and fixed. Relying solely on changing the dressing will not help. If immediate incision is not possible, maintaining cleanliness is necessary under the principle of quietness. Some people say that the new therapy does not work in summer, and the wound will stink if the dressing is not changed, which is incorrect. As long as the new therapy is done well, truly smelly wounds will not be many. Doctors must allocate strength to focus on serious injuries, maintain cleanliness, and strengthen care. As long as the treatment plan is correct, serious injuries will soon turn into minor injuries. Doctors should not plan to use the new therapy to find leisure time, but should work harder for the wounded, work realistically according to the principles of the new therapy and the condition of the wound, not to steal leisure.
    IV. Repeated Education and Emphasis on Disinfection
    Underlying the new therapy is strict aseptic surgical operation. The small action of "changing dressings" was previously neglected by doctors and left to nurses, or obvious surgical infectious diseases were treated as malaria; or even the changes in the wound were not understood by doctors, and nurses of course had to live one day at a time. Many simple and common surgical problems are not understood by some doctors, so repeated education is necessary. For wound complications, wound treatment principles, bandaging, dressing change operations, and systematic disinfection, three or five times of education, experiments, inspections, and corrections are needed. After a fairly strict management and education period, the old can be truly changed, and the new therapy can be fully adopted. Complacency and stagnation must be guarded against!
    V. Quietness and Poultices Can Relieve Pain and Reduce Inflammation
    After human tissue is injured, infection and reactive inflammation are common. Only by keeping the injured limb still or applying warm, moist poultices can inflammation be quickly reduced, pain relieved, and pus formation prevented. Being carried from the battlefield to the rear hospital has a great impact on the wound and is unavoidable, so the rate of inflammation in new wounds is high. But as long as the limb is quiet, or raised, and poultices are applied, most of it can be eliminated. The rate of pus formation can therefore be reduced by more than half.
    Moist warm poultices, under the condition of not hindering the quietness of the injured limb, are a beneficial and harmless physical therapy. This increases absorption and excretion functions and has a good impact on wound healing.
    VI. The Role of Sulfonamides S.N. in the New Therapy:
    Sulfonamides can seize the nutrients needed by bacteria in the wound, limit the reproduction of bacteria, and eventually lead to death. The effect of dispersing sulfonamides in new wounds within six to twelve hours to prevent pus formation is greatest. After the wound becomes infected with pus, tissue protein decomposition is extremely vigorous, and when the bacteria in the wound need a lot of nutrients, the effectiveness of sulfonamides is greatly reduced. If there are no sulfonamides, the rate of wound infection with pus will increase; but strict aseptic surgical operations to reduce wound infection are still possible. Everyone must clearly recognize that compared with the use of sulfonamides and strict aseptic surgical operations, the latter should be paid more attention to, otherwise sulfonamides will not help. It is very obvious in our hospitals that under the same drug conditions, the best hospital (European Hospital) always maintains a pus formation rate of 4%, while poor hospitals often account for 20%-50%. Artificial treatment, strict adherence to principles, coupled with the chemical function of sulfonamides, can achieve full effectiveness.
    Before the wound becomes infected with pus within six to twelve hours, do not be stingy with sulfonamides, and apply enough as early as possible, but sulfonamides only work when dissolved in body fluids. Applying it outside the wound is a waste. Wounds heal at least a month earlier without pus formation. According to financial consumption, the widespread use of sulfonamides should also be promoted; but it needs to be used early, with little medicine and great effect; sprinkling it in the wound can be useful; it only achieves full effectiveness when used simultaneously with strict aseptic work.
   VII. Preventing Eczema
    Applying too much iodine, irritation from secretions, and improper use of long-term moist bandages can easily cause eczema, causing the wound edges to itch, ooze, spread infection, and delay healing. In the later stages of treatment, avoid frequent use of iodine, especially forbidden inside the wound. The wound should be kept clean at all times, and attention should be paid to protection when mild inflammation is found on the epidermis. Dry powder rice (talcum powder, zinc oxide powder) can be sprinkled. In addition, unsuitable bandages, collateral damage from fractures, poor local skin nutrition, and swelling are all causes of increased eczema, so attention should also be paid to prevention at the same time. Eczema with yellow discharge is a streptococcal infection, and should be treated with potassium permanganate solution, poultices, or sprinkling a mixture of sulfonamides and zinc oxide powder. Generally, no treatment is required, and it can be cured by removing the cause.
    VIII. Absolute Fixation of Fractures is a Good Way to Reduce Pus Formation
    When a bone is broken, the injured limb and the wounded feel great pain every time they are moved, and the tissue damaged by the broken bone ends is very serious, which must cause serious infection. This is the reason why more dressing changes lead to more pus. Therefore, fixing the injured limb is a very important thing in the new therapy. Initially, use wooden splints for reliable relative fixation, and then wrap it with plaster bandages after three days. This not only reduces pus formation, but also greatly reduces disabilities. Changing the dressing once and moving the injured limb once is the most wrong and stupid approach, correct it quickly.

　　推行新疗法的经验
    钱信忠
   “天天换药，成了顽固伤口，经年累月不愈。”这段子弯路医生们多走过，负伤同志曾尝过，习惯成自然，没人反对；伤员愿意医生关心他一点，自己才放心，换药是医生们对伤员关心的最实在的表现，不管合理不合理，都有些两相情愿。新疗法是冲破了这种习惯和不合理的换药制度而出现的。兹将推行新疗法的经验介绍如下，作为进一步研究的开端。
    一、伤口不痛不换药也没意见
    当推行新疗法的开始，医生们不习惯，伤员们也不愿不换药。克服这个困难的唯一方法是：提高医生对伤员的治疗能力，忠诚负责的态度在伤员中建立好影响，进行新疗法的宣传教育；告诉他不痛不要换药，痛时请医生看，随便换药就会坏事等。伤员最大的希望是伤口不痛，所以新疗法的推行，基本上还需在工作上建立信仰，药换得好，创口处理得对，不传染，伤口不痛，伤员就没意见。
    二、抓紧时机突击第一天与第一周的医疗
    负伤第一天六——十二小时以内，伤口得到完善的处理，化脓就少；因为细菌还未站住脚，医生就去切除或上＠①胺剂限制了它的活动，很快伤口就战胜了细菌。不化脓的道理就在此。
    伤口在第一周间变化最大最快，治疗上要抓住下列几点进行突击：１、伤员的安静与肢体的安静。２、充分给水，充分睡眠，充分营养。３、判明伤情确定治疗方针。４、周到的护理。５、进行伤的分类，建立各种治疗组织，力求名符其实。
    三、换药原则
    该换就换，不该换就不换。机械的几天换一次与天天换药都不妥当，提倡负责态度，按伤口的需要来换药。没有脓，不肿，不痛的伤口，稳稳的休息，只须每天检查一次，不要换药，有脓出不来，流脓不止，就要切开，固定，单靠换药不顶事。不能马上切开的，在安静之原则下，保持清洁是必需的。有人说新疗法夏天行不通，伤口不换药就要臭，这是不对的。只要新疗法作得好，真正有臭味的伤口不会多。医生必须抽力量来突击重伤，保持清洁，加强护理。只要治疗方针正确，重伤不久变轻伤。医生们不要打算用新疗法来找闲空，而应该更加忙碌的为伤员工作，根据新疗法的道理，按照伤口的情形，实事求是的工作，不是偷闲。
    四、反复教育重视消毒
    贯穿新疗法的是严密消毒的外科操作。“换药”这个小动作，以前被医生们轻视，交给看护作，或把很显著的外科传染病当作疟疾治疗；甚或创伤的变化医生也不明白，看护员当然也只得过一天算一天。许多外科上的简单常见的问题，有些医生都弄不通，因此要进行反复的教育。对于创伤合并症，创伤的处理原则，捆绷带，换药的操作，消毒的体系化，都需要三翻五次的教育，实验，检查，纠正，经过相当严格的管理教育时期，才能真正改变旧的，完全采用新的疗法。自满与停顿的现象，都须警惕！
    五、安静与罨包可以止痛消炎
    人体组织受伤后，传染与反应性的炎症是常见的，只有让受伤的肢体安静不动或进行温湿性罨包才能迅速消炎，止痛，不致于化脓。由战场抬到后方医院，这过程对伤口有着很大影响而又不可避免，因此新伤口发生炎症的比率很大。但只要肢体安静，或高举，进行罨包，绝大部分可以消下去的。化脓的比率因此也可以减少大半。
    湿性温包，在不防碍伤肢安静的条件下，是有百利无一弊的理学治法。借此增加吸收、排泄功能，对伤口愈合有良好影响。
    六、＠胺剂Ｓ·Ｎ·在新疗法中的作用：
    ＠胺剂能在伤口里夺取细菌需要的营养素，限制了细菌的繁殖，最后致于死地。新伤在六——十二小时里会散布＠胺剂，防止化脓的功效最大。伤口化脓后，组织蛋白分解极旺盛，伤口里的细菌需要的营养素很多时，胺剂的效力就大大减低。倘若没有＠胺剂，伤口化脓比率会增高；但严密消毒的外科操作，使伤口少化脓，还是同样可能的。大家必须明确的认识，用布＠胺剂与严密消毒的外科操作比较，后者更要注意，否则＠胺也无济于事。在我们各医院看得很显然，同样的药物条件，最好的医院（欧院）经常保持化脓率百分之四，差的医院竟经常占百分之二十——五十人为的治疗，严格遵守原则，加上＠胺剂的化学功能，才能收全效。
    伤口在六——十二小时内化脓前，不要吝啬＠胺，可尽早的足够量的上，但＠胺要在体液能溶解才起作用，上在伤口外是一种浪费。伤口不经化脓，至少要早愈合一个月。按财政消耗，也当提倡普遍的用＠胺；但需用在早期，药少功大；撒在创里，才能有用；用在严密消毒工作的同时，始收全效。
   七、防止湿疹
    多涂碘酒，分泌物受刺激，及长期的湿性绷带用之不当，都容易引起湿疹，使创缘发痒、流水、传染、迟延愈合。在后期治疗中当避免常用碘酒，尤为创伤内禁用。伤口要经常保持清洁，表皮发现轻度炎症时，更当注意保护。可撒布干燥粉米（滑石粉，锌养粉）。此外绷带不合适，骨折的副损伤，局部皮肤营养不佳，肿胀等，都是增加湿疹的原因，故同时亦当注意防止。流黄水的湿疹，是连球菌的感染，当以过锰酸钾液，罨包，或撒布＠胺、锌氧粉之合剂。一般不需治疗，除去原因即可痊愈。
    八、骨折的绝对固定是减少化脓的一个好办法
    骨头断了，伤肢、伤员每次被抬动时，都感极大痛苦，而且骨断端破伤组织很严重，必须引起严重的传染，这就是多换一次药多一次脓的道理。因此新疗法中固定伤肢是一件很重要的事。初期用木夹作确实的相对固定，三天后缠以石羔绷带，这样不但化脓减少，残废亦大大的减少。换一次药，抬动一次伤肢，是最错误最愚蠢的作法，赶快纠正。
