Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: TASS, Athens: Greek guerrillas have been continuously gaining victories in recent battles. On the night of May 9th, a small detachment of guerrillas entered the city of Veria, where a large number of government troops were stationed, and destroyed the arsenal. On the island of Crete, guerrillas occupied the city of Israilter after a battle, capturing grain warehouses and a large number of military spoils. The guerrillas re-occupied the city of Sporades, occupying it for twenty-four hours and seizing a large amount of spoils. The guerrillas attacked the guards of "prisoners" on a train in Morea, releasing twenty-eight "prisoners." In central Greece, especially in the Thrace region, continuous battles of various sizes are taking place.
　　
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: TASS, Athens: For more than ten days, the Greek Parliament has been discussing the issue of resisting the guerrillas. At the meeting on May 6th, members of parliament from Morea (in southern Greece) declared that the government forces had been conducting military operations against the guerrillas for two months, without achieving any success. On the contrary, the number of guerrillas in southern Morea has doubled. Former Minister of the Army, Navaronivris, claimed that even before the start of the war, he had warned the American military attaché that 180,000 troops were needed to suppress the guerrillas' activities, but the American military attaché did not believe him. Navaronivris said, "Now, I must say that an even larger force is needed." When talking about the war in Morea, Navaronivris declared that the war proved that the constabulary could not deal with the guerrillas. Zvas, who commanded the constabulary in Morea, said that it was not only the constabulary that was defeated, but some army units also often suffered defeats. There were setbacks not only in Morea but also in Marton and other places. Gritunus strongly emphasized the complex situation on the island of Crete, where all the people currently hold weapons.

　　希游击队不断攻克城市  反动派正规军常吃败仗
    【新华社陕北十四日电】塔斯社雅典讯：希腊游击队最近在作战中不断获得胜利。五月九日夜，游击队一小支队打进了驻扎着大批政府军的维瑞亚城，并炸毁军火库。在克里特岛，游击队在作战后占领了伊斯拉珍尔特城，缴获了粮食仓库和大批军用胜利品。游击队再度攻占斯波拉提城，占据二十四小时，缴获大量胜利品。游击队在摩里亚袭击火车上“囚犯”的看守人，放出了二十八个“囚犯”。在希腊中部，特别是在色雷斯地区，继续不断的进行着大小战斗。
    【新华社陕北十四日电】塔斯社雅典讯：十几天来希腊国会一直讨论着与游击队抗争的问题。在五月六日的会议上，摩里亚（在西腊南部）的议员们宣称：政府军对游击队进行了两个月的作战行动，远未获得任何成就。相反的，却使摩里亚南部游击队的数量增加了一倍。前陆军部长纳瓦罗尼夫里斯称：甚至在战争开始前，他曾警告美国武官说，为着镇压游击队的活动，需要十八万陆军，但美国武官并不相信他。纳氏谓：“现在，我务必说更大的兵力是需要的。”纳氏在谈及摩里亚之战争时宣称：战争证明宪兵队不能对付游击队。指挥宪兵在摩里亚作战的兹瓦斯说：打败仗的不仅是宪兵，而且某些陆军部队也常吃败仗。不但在摩里亚有挫折，在马尔顿等地也有挫折。格里特奴斯力陈克里特岛上之复杂情况，该地的全体人民目前皆执有武器。
