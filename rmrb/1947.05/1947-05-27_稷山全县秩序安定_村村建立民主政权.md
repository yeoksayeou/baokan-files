　　[Taiyue Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 24th] Jishan County is entirely stable, with all of Chiang and Yan's defeated soldiers and bandits, numbering over 400, having been completely eliminated. Democratic governments have been established in every village, and social order is moving towards stability. Since the county's liberation, there have been remnants of Chiang and Yan's troops and local bandits, totaling about 300, led by the stubborn county magistrate Feng Mingde, who have been harassing our first, third, and fourth districts from their hideouts near the Fen River and the Lüliang Mountains. After diligent suppression by our county brigade and the third district's backbone teams, this force was completely eliminated on the 10th of this month. A total of over 30 officers and soldiers were captured, including the deputy captain of the 14th detachment, Ning Mingjiu, and the political director, Wu Huitian; the captured equipment included 4 machine guns, 2 grenade launchers, 64 rifles, 17 short guns, and over 2,500 rounds of various types of ammunition. A total of 264 remnants of the 39th Division, 72nd Division, and the Security Police Corps surrendered to us. Seeing that the situation was hopeless, over 100 personnel from Yan's puppet village administration have registered with the democratic government to express repentance in recent days. There are currently no traces of enemies or puppets within the county.
