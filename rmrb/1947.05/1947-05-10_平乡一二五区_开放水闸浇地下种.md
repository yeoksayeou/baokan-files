　　Pingxiang First, Second, and Fifth Districts
    Opening Water Gates to Irrigate Land for Sowing
    [This newspaper's Pingxiang dispatch] In order to carry out this year's large-scale production movement and enable the masses to sow as early as possible, the districts opened the water gates of the Fuyang River to irrigate the land after the thaw. With the active efforts of the masses downstream working day and night, the first, second, and fifth districts have now completed the task of opening the gates. Each gate can irrigate one or two *qing* of land per day. In the second district, the Dongtianzhuang, Tunli, and Xiazhuangqiao gates have been opened. In the first district, Dongxuzhuang, Haojiazhuang, Hengtou, Qianhou Youzhao, Guojiamazhuang, and Xisizhuang have also been opened. The Daliuzhuang gate can irrigate seven *qing* of land per day. In the fifth district, Douzhuang, Hexi Lijiazhuang, Yinlinqiao, Yangcun, Yincun, Nanzhouzhang, Chongyiting, Zhao Zhuang, Pangzhuang, Beixinzhuang and other twelve gates are releasing water to irrigate the land at the same time. Among them, the Douzhuang gate can irrigate five *qing* of land every day, and has now irrigated 200 *qing* of land. Other gates irrigate an average of more than two *qing* of land per day. Currently, more than six-tenths of the land in the first, second, and fifth districts has been irrigated. The masses are very happy and say, "This way, we don't have to worry about not being able to plant autumn seedlings."
