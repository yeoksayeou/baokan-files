　　A Battlefield Tour of Tangyin Before Liberation
    Fang De
    On the night of April 23rd, the field army recovered the West Gate of Tangyin. The traitor Sun Dianying's troops sneaked out every night to counterattack, sometimes as many as four times a night. The People's Liberation Army soldiers paid no attention, only showering the enemy with a barrage of hand grenades when they approached.
    On nights when the gunfire was sparse, the soldiers hung a piece of cloth at the entrance of their small cave-like bunkers, lit small oil lamps, and those who were literate read the tabloid newspapers in twos and threes, guessing the riddles in them. Those who were illiterate asked others to read to them. Some new soldiers learned shooting and grenade throwing from the veteran soldiers. Bullets whizzed over the bunkers, but they didn't even listen.
    Family letters and merit citation announcements specially made by the military region's cultural troupe were sent to the front line only thirty meters from the enemy, which was the happiest moment for the soldiers. Everyone scrambled to grab them, savoring each word and sentence with great relish. Guo Haisheng received a letter from home saying that the news of his merit in the Juye Recovery Battle had spread to his village, and the whole village came to congratulate him, and a plaque of honor was hung on the door; the letter immediately spread everywhere. Li Zixiang of the fourth squad vowed: "I will also strive to get a plaque of honor hung."
    On the second day after our army occupied the West Gate, Chiang Kai-shek's American-made planes came to bomb and deliver ammunition to the enemy, encouraging the traitor Sun Dianying to persevere desperately; however, the positions of the two armies were so close that they threw the ammunition into the People's Liberation Army positions and the bombs into the city. The People's Liberation Army soldiers cheered and shouted, "Good! Throw a few more!"

　　汤阴解放前战场巡礼
    方德
    野战军于四月二十三日夜收复了汤阴西关，汉奸孙殿英部每夜贼头贼脑地出来反扑一阵，有时一夜达四次之多。解放军战士们并不睬理，只在敌人扑近时飨以一阵密集的手榴弹。
    在枪声稀疏的夜里，战士们在小窑式的掩体门口挂起一块布，点起小油灯，识字的三三两两念着小报，猜着小报上的谜语；不识字的要求人家念给他听。有些新战士，向老战士学习射击与投弹。子弹从窑上嘶嘶飞过，他们听也不听。
    家信与军区文工团特制的立功喜报送上距敌只三十米的前沿，这是战士们最快乐的时刻。大伙人争着抢着，津津有味地逐字逐句咀嚼。郭海生家里来信，说他在巨野光复战中立功的喜报传到家里，全村都来贺喜，门上挂了光荣牌；家信立即传遍各处。四班李自祥发誓说：“我也要争取挂个光荣牌。”
    蒋介石的美制飞机在我军占领西关的第二天，飞来轰炸，并给敌人送弹药，鼓励汉奸孙殿英拚命坚持；但是，两军阵地是如此接近，以致他们把弹药都扔到了解放军阵地，而把炸弹都扔到了城里。解放军战士们拍手欢呼：“好呀！再扔几个！”
