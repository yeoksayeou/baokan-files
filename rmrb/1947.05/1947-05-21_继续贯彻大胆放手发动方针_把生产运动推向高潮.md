　　Continue to Implement the Policy of Boldly Unleashing the Masses to Push the Production Movement to a Climax
    Taihang Third Special District Commissioner's Office

    In the past month, due to the policy of boldly unleashing the masses in various counties, a full and in-depth ideological mobilization has been carried out from the county to the village, from the active and backward elements to all farmers. The compensation for the losses suffered by the middle peasants and the publicity and education of policies have preliminarily resolved the farmers' concerns and doubts about getting rich. In addition, as the farming season is approaching and planting is urgently needed, farmers have a basic desire to get rich (especially the peasants who have been emancipated), although there are some obstacles. They do not fundamentally refuse to engage in production, especially when the majority of the masses are taking action, which also corresponds to the idea of "getting rich together." Even among the newly emancipated peasants who have some doubts about getting rich, they still respond enthusiastically to the call of the higher authorities. Under these circumstances, all farmers consciously and unconsciously participated in and were drawn into the movement, opened the first stage of production, and smoothly launched a comprehensive spring plowing and mutual assistance planting movement. However, this movement is only the beginning and has not yet formed a fervent climax; therefore, there can be no complacency. It is still necessary to continue to implement the policy of boldly unleashing the masses and use all efforts to educate and organize the masses to create a fervent climax in the movement.

    At present, some comrades simply rely on the development of the movement or the words of the masses, saying, "We are not afraid anymore," "We have figured it out," believing that the ideological problem has been completely solved and everything is easy to handle. This is being misled by appearances. In fact, the farmers' concerns, although not their essential thoughts, have a certain material basis and cannot be completely resolved at once. At present, some people conceal these ideological concerns, and the atmosphere of not daring to get rich that was prevalent some time ago no longer exists, which is the objective factor that is most likely to cause cadres to have misconceptions and be complacent, so we should be vigilant.

    Since farmers still have hidden concerns and doubts in their minds (although they are partial and not as widespread and serious as before), it will still be a major obstacle to achieving the goal of "cultivating three and reserving one" and striving for every household to have surplus grain in the future. For example, in Beidong, Changzhi, several households said a few days ago that they were not afraid of struggle and wanted to buy livestock but had no money. However, recently, when the village was offered a loan of 180,000 yuan (for agriculture), they refused it. A newly emancipated peasant in Jinzhuang Village, Huguan, was unhappy because he was given half a mu more land (the village average). This is proof.

    Therefore, cadres must clearly recognize that the masses still have lingering concerns about not daring to get rich and must implement the policy of unleashing the masses in the production movement to eliminate the stumbling blocks on the road to "cultivating three and reserving one." The basic target of this mobilization is the old middle peasants, and the method cannot be exactly the same as before (mass mobilization meetings). The main method should first be to cultivate newly emancipated peasants from poor backgrounds and let the heroic new rich peasants influence all farmers with their own active actions to get rich. Secondly, rely on mutual aid groups to see from their plans, production enthusiasm, and lifestyle whether they really dare to boldly get rich. The positiveness of the plan, the size of the production drive, and the extravagance or frugality of life will specifically explain whether a person's thinking about getting rich has been thoroughly clarified. If the performance is not bold, we must promote their active management and enrichment through education. The in-depth policy publicity by the leadership and the commendation of the new rich peasants also have a certain effect.

    At the beginning of the movement, we have opened the door to ideological obstacles and created a mass spring plowing movement. In the future, it will still be a more arduous mobilization process, and clarifying thinking must be implemented throughout the year and in every action to get rich (not in isolation). If this is not clearly defined and not adhered to, the goal of universally achieving "cultivating three and reserving one" will inevitably be just an empty slogan; at the same time, in this regard, it is also necessary for various regions to create more experience.

　　继续贯彻大胆放手发动方针
    把生产运动推向高潮
    太行三专署
    一月来由于各县在大胆放手发动的方针下，从县到村，从积极层、落后层到全体农民，进行了充分深入的思想发动。受损失的中农得到补偿以及政策的宣传教育，农民的发家顾虑与怀疑，已初步得到解决。加以农事季节迫近，急待下种，农民在发家要求（特别是翻身户）上虽有些障碍，但想发家是基本的，不是根本不生产，尤其是当大部分群众行动起来的时候，也正与“要发一齐发”的思想相符合，在新翻身农民中即使对发家稍有怀疑，但同时对上级号召却依然热烈响应。在这种情况下，所有的农民都自觉与不自觉的参加和被卷入运动，打开了生产的第一关，顺利的开展了全面的春耕互助下种运动。但这个运动还只是开始，均未形成一个热火朝天的高潮；因此不能有任何满足，仍须继续贯彻大胆放手发动方针，用全力去教育和组织群众，把运动造成一个热火朝天的高潮。
    目前却有部分同志单从运动的开展或群众口头上说：“不怕了”，“想通啦”。认为彻底解决了思想问题，一切都好搞了，这便是为现象所迷。实际上农民这种顾虑，虽然不是本质思想，却有其一定的物质基础，绝不是一下可以能解决彻底。目前有部分人把这些思想顾虑隐蔽起来，在前些时普遍流传不敢发家的空气，也不多存在了，这是最容易引起干部错觉和自满的客观因素，还应警惕。
    农民思想上既隐蔽着还有顾虑怀疑（虽然是部分的不像以前那样普遍严重），那末对今后实现耕三余一，争取户户有余粮，依然是个大障碍。如长治北董有几户前几天就说可不怕斗争啦，想买牲口就是没钱，但最近该村贷款十八万元（农业）他却不要了。壶关晋庄村一个翻身户多分了半亩地（全村平均数）就不高兴了，这是一个证明。
    因此在干部思想上必须明确认识群众思想上还有不敢发家的顾虑潜伏着，必须在生产运动中贯彻放手发动、消灭耕三余一道路上的绊脚石。这个发动基本对象是老中农，在方法上就不能完全照旧的做法（大会动员），主要方法首先应该以培养贫苦出身的新翻身户，以英雄新富农自己积极的发家行动影响全部农民。其次是依靠互助组，从订计划、生产情绪、生活表现，各方面看他是否真敢大胆发家，计划的积极与否，生产劲头的大小，生活的奢俭，都会具体说明一个人发家思想到底是打通了没有。如表现不大胆，就须从教育中推动其积极经营发家。领导上的深入政策宣传，表扬新富农也有一定的作用。
    运动开始我们已打开了思想障碍的大门，造成了群众性的春耕运动，今后仍是更艰苦的发动过程，打通思想要贯彻全年与每个发家行动上（不是孤立做）。如果不明确这一点，不坚持这一点，普遍达到耕三余一的方针，结果必然只是一个空口号；同时在这方面，还需要各地创造更多的经验。
