Responding to the District Party Committee's Call for Drought Resistance
　　The Entire Village of Shengfotang is Rush-Planting
　　Six Villages including Mengguanzhuang are Digging Canals to Irrigate the Land
[This newspaper, Jinnan, 17th] The District Party Committee urgently called for a crash program of planting, drought resistance and famine preparation. The masses of Shengfotang in Wei County immediately responded, striving to plant all 1,004 mu of land in the village that had not yet been planted. Since the 9th, men and women, young and old, throughout the village have launched a rush to plant. In two days, they planted 237.5 mu of millet, beans, sesame, and melons, together with the 696.5 mu of sorghum and cotton that had been planted previously, for a total of 934 mu.
[This newspaper, Jinnan, 17th] Vowing to fight against the drought, the masses of the Second District of Jize are digging ditches to irrigate the land. The masses of six villages including Mengguanzhuang, Liguanzhuang, and Zhangguanzhuang in the Second District, having accepted the experience of the great drought of 1943, and seeing that it has not rained for a long time this year, are determined to save themselves. They are actively connecting to the Fuyang River to dig canals to irrigate the land. The canal is 2,305 zhang long and can irrigate 107 qing of land. The entire project is divided among the six villages, with each person responsible for 4 zhang 7 chi 5 cun, with a depth of 5 chi and a bottom width of 3 chi. It can be completed in ten days. The masses of the six villages have already started work, and their enthusiasm is a hundredfold.
[This newspaper, Jinnan, 17th] The victory of the re-examination in Ganjizhen, Wei County, has ended. Not a single one of the thirty-four landlords has escaped. A large number of land, houses and various utensils have been cleared out. The peasants have generally risen, and each person has been allocated four mu of land. The whole town has taken on a new look. They are now launching a crash program to plant cotton and dig wells to prevent drought. More than 3,000 mu of land have been plowed, and more than 1,000 mu of sorghum have been planted. The women are spinning thread intensely. Fifty looms can weave more than eighty zhang of homespun cloth every day. At dawn, the sound of manure carts, the sound of weaving machines, and the crowing of roosters are mixed together. The town had less than ten cattle three years ago, but now it has more than a hundred. Labor hero Zhang Dongting cultivated two and one-third last year, and this year he bought a big cart and exchanged it for a big cow. He plans to accumulate more fertilizer, cultivate deeply and carefully, and also asked his daughter, Xiaogai, to learn to weave towels, so that he can cultivate one and one-third this year.

    【本报冀南十七日电】誓与旱灾作斗争，鸡泽二区群众挖沟浇地。二区孟贯庄、李贯庄、张贯庄等六村群众接受卅二年大旱经验，目睹今年久旱不雨，决心设法自救，积极接连滏阳河挖渠浇地，该渠长二千三百零五丈，能浇地一百零七顷，全部工程由六村分担，每人应分四丈七尺五寸，以深五尺、底三尺计，十天内足可完成。现六村群众已经动工，情绪百倍高涨。
    【本报冀南十七日电】威县干集镇复查胜利结束，三十四户地主无一漏网，又清算出大批土地房屋及各种用具，农民普遍上升，每人填到四亩地，全镇景象焕然一新。刻正突击点种棉花、挖井防旱，全镇已翻地三千余亩，种高粱千余亩。妇女们紧张纺线，五十张机子，每天可织八十余丈土布。每天破晓，送粪的车声，织布的机声与雄鸡的报晓声，混作一团。该镇三年来从不足十头牛，现已添到百余头。劳动英雄张洞庭，去年作到耕二余一，今年买大车，换大牛，计划多积肥，深耕细作，并叫自己女儿小改学织毛巾，要在今年作到耕一余一。
