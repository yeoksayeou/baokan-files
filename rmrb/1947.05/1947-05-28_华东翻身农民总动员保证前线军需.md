Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 26th: During the victorious summer counter-offensive of the East China People's Liberation Army over the past month, 500,000 organized people in Shandong directly supported the front lines. People from Jiaodong, Bohai, and even the suburbs of Tianjin traveled long distances to the battlefield. More than 1,500 village and township cadres and militiamen from the four counties of Lushan (newly established county), Sishui, Qufu, and Zou County, armed with guns and ammunition, formed stretcher teams to serve with the army. The third batch of permanent civilian laborers from Binbei rushed to the front lines overnight. The people of Yizhong (newly established county), while busily transporting and preparing supplies, immediately dispatched 300 stretchers upon hearing the victory report from Menglianggu. Many cadres and demobilized laborers, some having been demobilized for less than ten days, eagerly volunteered, considering it a supreme honor to serve in this great victorious campaign. 6,500 permanent civilian laborers from Zhuting (old Ganyu) took exceptional care of the wounded. One unit of permanent civilian laborers from Yizhong has been serving with the army continuously for four months, traversing mountains and rivers, enduring hardships, and completing their tasks quickly. Another unit, upon demobilization, requested to accept another rear transportation mission. Permanent civilian laborers from Cangma (newly established county) served with the army for several months, recently completing a long-distance grain transportation mission of over 1,000 li round trip. The transportation teams in each county and district are well-organized, with each cart generally carrying over 200 jin of cargo and marching 50-60 li per day. Especially in the mountainous areas of central Shandong, they overcame various difficulties unimaginable to ordinary people with their strong will, ensuring the supply of provisions and ammunition for the troops and preparing the necessary conditions for victory. The transportation team of 2,000 carts from Zhuting followed the troops and never fell behind, making a great contribution.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 26th: One million liberated women in the central Shandong region enthusiastically supported the front lines, completing 500,000 pairs of military shoes and grinding over 60 million jin of rice and flour in the past two months. During the annihilation battles of Laiwu, Tai'an, and Yimeng, they also surged onto the battlefield in large numbers, undertaking tasks such as stretcher transportation, delivering provisions and ammunition on the front lines, acting as guides, repairing roads, and destroying roads. Women in Linbuzhuang Village, Miaoshan District, Laiwu, repaired roads while transporting shells to the front lines in batches. Under the leadership of female labor model Wang Yuzhen, Damanzi Village completed 5,000 jin of pancakes despite a shortage of pots after preparing for war, and led 23 young women to deliver them to the battlefield 20 li away from the village, braving enemy aircraft strafing and artillery fire, deeply moving the soldiers. During the Laiwu campaign, seven women in Zhizhi Village guided the troops overnight. Wang Xiuhua carried her baby and guided the way for ten li, with thorns on the mountain piercing her feet, but she still insisted on reaching the destination. The women of Zhugang District, Tai'an County, repaired the Tai'an-Laiwu highway, which runs through the district, overnight on the eve of the Tai'an campaign. Dongbu Village, Yiyuan, transported 11,000 jin of grain and 40,000 jin of firewood in ten days. During the counter-offensive and blocking operations in Yimeng, the women of the villages on both sides of the road participated in carrying stretchers and transporting the wounded. 8,000 liberated women militia members from the entire central Shandong region actively participated in the war. Female militia members from Cheyin Nanyu, Changzhuang District, Laiwu, fought alongside male militia members, capturing 13 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers and seizing two machine guns and eight rifles. Twelve female militia members from Gude Fan guarded more than 400 prisoners. During the war preparation before the Menglianggu campaign, Xian Kejun, a female militia hero from Xiatucheng Village, Miaozhuang District, Yiyuan County, promoted and taught six male militia members methods of burying landmines, pulling wires, running with mines, and stepping on mines. Female militia members in various places generally took on the tasks of standing guard, investigating and arresting special agents, and maintaining public order in the villages.
