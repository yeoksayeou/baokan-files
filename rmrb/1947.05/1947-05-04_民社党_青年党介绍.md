Introduction to the Democratic Socialist Party and the China Youth Party

Democratic Socialist Party

The "Democratic Socialist Party" was formed by the "National Socialist Party" and the "Democratic Constitutionalist Party" of overseas Chinese. The predecessors of these two parties were both royalist parties during the Qing Dynasty. The royalist party was led by Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao during the Reform Movement of 1898 in the late Qing Dynasty. They were always in opposition to Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary Tongmenghui. After the Xinhai Revolution, Kang Youwei consistently advocated for the preservation of the monarchy. Although this idea failed after Zhang Xun's restoration attempt, Kang Youwei's followers continued to oppose the revolution overseas. It was not until the establishment of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary Nanjing regime that they formed the "Democratic Constitutionalist Party" overseas. This is the party led by Wu Xianzix, now a "National Government Member" in Chiang's government, and Li Daming, "Minister without Portfolio of the Executive Yuan". Liang Qichao, who was as famous as Kang Youwei, changed from "preserving the monarchy" to "preserving Yuan," organizing the "Democratic Party," which later became the "Research Clique," helping Yuan Shikai oppose Sun Yat-sen, suppress the revolution, and dissolve the parliament. However, when Yuan Shikai went too far and wanted to implement the imperial system, Liang Qichao thought it was "not the right time" and turned to support Cen Chunxuan in opposing Yuan. Then he supported Duan Qirui in opposing Sun Yat-sen, advocating participation in World War I, and later continuously participated in the warlord infighting of the Northern Warlords. This is the history of the Research Clique as accomplices to the reactionary warlords. Zhang Junmai (originally named Zhang Jiasen, the elder brother of Zhang Jialin), the current "leader" of the Democratic Socialist Party, and many of his party members, followed Liang Qichao of the Research Clique at that time. Now they continue Liang Qichao's tradition, and after "preserving the monarchy," "preserving Yuan," and "preserving Duan," they have come to preserve Chiang. Tang Zhuxin (i.e., Tang Xiangming), a party member of Zhang Junmai, is the younger brother of Tang Hualong of the Research Clique. He was the military governor of Hunan during Yuan Shikai's time and was known by the people of Hunan as "Butcher Tang." During the Anti-Japanese War, Tang Zhuxin became a traitor in Beiping, and Zeng Qi, who received stipends from Wang Jingwei's government in Shanghai and Nanjing, became two remotely opposed traitors in the north and south of the Democratic Socialist Party and the China Youth Party. It should be remembered that when the Chongqing Xinhua Daily announced Tang as a traitor last year, Chiang Kai-shek's Central Daily News said that he was "unyielding in resisting the enemy," and Zhang Junmai also tried to defend him. However, the people of Beiping all know that Tang Xiangming is a big traitor. Ji Yiqiao, who represents the Democratic Socialist Party in joining Chiang's government as a "National Government Member," is an infamous remnant of the Feng faction of the Northern Warlords. No one knows when he became involved with the Research Clique (or the National Socialist Party). But now he has suddenly become the Minister of Organization of the Democratic Socialist Party and a "National Government Member," which is truly shameful for those remnants of the Northern Warlords who have not yet died. No wonder Tang Xiangming, another warlord remnant who did not get a "government position," is feuding with Zhang Junmai.

In addition to gathering overseas royalist parties, domestic Research Cliques, and traitors and warlords, Zhang Junmai also has two groups that are always by his side: one is the family group, i.e., his brothers, sisters, and relatives, who are a group of Chiang family officials pushing him to support Chiang; the other is the disciple group, represented by his disciple Jiang Yuntian, who is single-mindedly eager to become an official. Therefore, the Democratic Socialist Party is just a group of royalists, traitors, warlords, family members, and disciples, precisely the most corrupt group among the feudal Chinese scholar-officials. It has neither a broad social base nor can it represent any truly liberal ideas. Even Zhang Junmai's opponents within the Democratic Socialist Party openly accuse Zhang of being an anti-liberal dictator. The reason why they are so eager to join the reactionary Chiang government is simply that they see the increasing decline of their class and want to support it by "preserving Chiang." But the result will be the same tragic fate as the "preserving the monarchy," "preserving Yuan," and "preserving Duan" of the royalist party and the Research Clique in those years.

China Youth Party

After World War I, in semi-colonial China, young intellectuals, feeling the crisis of national peril, developed in two ways: one was to recognize the greatness of the people's power and engage in revolutionary movements to seek national liberation; the other was to inherit the feudal comprador tradition and exploitative ideas, dreaming of maintaining their authoritarian rule on the ruins, and as a result, only embarked on the path of reaction and national betrayal. The former is the path taken by the CCP and the majority of progressive elements, and the latter is the path taken by a very small number of people in the China Youth Party. Therefore, no matter how the leaders of the China Youth Party boast that they also came from the "May Fourth" Movement and participated in patriotic movements, they took the opposite path from the progressive elements in China from the very beginning of their party formation. The program and slogan of the China Youth Party are "resisting foreign powers and eliminating domestic traitors," but the "powers" they resist are not the imperialists who invaded China, but the Soviet Union, which treats us as equals; the "traitors" they want to eliminate are not the Northern Warlords who were endangering China and harming the people, but Sun Yat-sen and the Communist Party who were leading the Kuomintang-Communist cooperation at that time. They praised Chen Jiongming's counter-revolutionary "federalism" and opposed Sun Yat-sen's national revolution. The nationalist faction that Sun Yat-sen denounced in the declaration of the first National Congress of his revolutionary Kuomintang was them. Zeng Qi, the party leader, wrote two lines of poetry in France: "Clemenceau is my teacher, and Poincaré is even more unquestionable." Clemenceau and Poincaré were both French imperialists before and after World War I, fully representing their militaristic ideas. He especially praised the anti-communist achievements of the "Young Turks Party," so the party's foreign name was originally the "Young China Party." At that time, whenever overseas Chinese masses gathered in France, Zeng Qi, Li Huang, He Luzhi, and others always put on their gentlemanly airs and disdained to associate with Chinese workers and poor students; they became a clear confrontation between two classes with the poor organizations in France at that time. When Zeng Qi and others returned to China and ran the "Awakened Lion" newspaper with Zuo Shunsheng, Chen Qitian, Yu Jiaju, and others, they openly stood on the side of Chen Jiongming and Zhao Hengti's counter-revolutionary "federalism" and opposed Sun Yat-sen's Three Great Policies, becoming the most opposed reactionary group by the young masses at that time, and everyone called them "lion dogs." From then on, the China Youth Party has always been attached to warlords in various places. Whether it was Wu Peifu, Zhang Zuolin, Yan Xishan, Sun Chuanfang in the north, or Chen Jiongming, Liu Xiang, etc. in the south, they all joined and relied on them. During the "May 30th" Movement, they were the open running dogs of British imperialism. After the establishment of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule, they adopted a two-faced policy. On the one hand, Zeng Qi and others stayed in the north to collude with anti-Chiang warlords, and on the other hand, Zuo Shunsheng served as a teacher in the Chiang-controlled political school in Nanjing. Therefore, after the Anti-Japanese War, Zuo Shunsheng talked loudly about "resisting Japan" in Chongqing, while Zeng Qi ran to Shanghai and Nanjing to become a traitor, chanting poetry and drinking with Liang Hongzhi, wanting to seek an official position in Wang Jingwei's government. Later, Zuo Shunsheng talked loudly about "anti-Chiang dictatorship" in Chongqing, while Li Huang received stipends from the Kuomintang government in Sichuan; even Zuo Shunsheng himself received "special fees" from the Kuomintang Military Commission during the same period. From this, it can be seen that their two-faced policy is mainly reactionary and based on personal interests. When a young party member of Zhang Xueliang's troops exposed the China Youth Party's collusion with Japanese寇, Zeng Qi and others immediately assassinated him. When the Kuomintang tried its best to divide the Democratic League, Zeng Qi and Zuo Shunsheng took the lead in receiving stipends and selling out the Democratic League.

The China Youth Party's despicable behavior of selling friends for glory and betraying the country to curry favor with foreign powers has its ideological roots. In the historical figures of the past hundred years, they have always admired Zeng Guofan, Li Hongzhang, and Liang Qichao, and despised revolutionaries. Zuo Shunsheng especially praised Li Hongzhang's traitorous diplomacy. In the Political Participation Council, Zuo Shunsheng supported Wang Jingwei's "peace" proposition. And now the "China Times" hosted by Zuo Shunsheng openly advocates pro-American imperialism. Chang Yansheng, a member of the Central Committee of the China Youth Party and now Minister without Portfolio of the Executive Yuan of Chiang's government, wrote an article in the Chengdu organ newspaper of the party, the "New China Daily," advocating that Chinese women should become Jeep girls in order to absorb foreign blood. It is said that this can "strengthen the race and strengthen the country," and the degree of its shamelessness is truly appalling.

This group of reactionary intellectuals, traitors, and petty bureaucrats, their history from beginning to end is ugly and shameless. After the China Youth Party was sold to the Kuomintang in batches, another central committee of the China Youth Party appeared; the figures of this new central committee themselves admitted that they had participated in Wang Jingwei's puppet government on the orders of Zeng (Qi), Zuo (Shunsheng), and Li (Huang). This group of figures of the new central committee is supported behind the scenes by the Kuomintang's "Revival Clique"; while Zeng Qi, Zuo Shunsheng, Li Huang, and others are supported by the "CC Clique" and the "Political Science Clique." The struggle between the two China Youth Parties also reflects the struggle between the "CC" and "Revival" cliques. This ugly state of the China Youth Party is exactly the same as the opposition of the Tang Xiangming faction to the Zhang Junmai faction in the Democratic Socialist Party.

　　民社党·青年党介绍
    民社党
    “民主社会党”是由“国家社会党”与华侨中的“民主宪政党”合组而成。这两党的前身都是满清时候的保皇党。保皇党是清末戊戍政变时康有为、梁启超所领导，他们与孙中山的革命的同盟会是一向处于敌对地位的。辛亥革命后，康有为就一直主张保皇；虽然这种主张在张勋复辟不成后已告失败，但康有为的党羽在海外却一直反对革命，直到蒋介石的南京反动政权建立以后，他们在海外才组成“民主宪政党”，这就是现在加入蒋政府的“国府委员”伍宪子及“行政院政务委员”李大明所领导的党。与康有为齐名的梁启超则“保皇”不成变而为“保袁”，组织“民主党”，后成“研究系”，帮助袁世凯反对孙中山，镇压革命，解散国会。但等到袁世凯走得太远要实行帝制时，梁启超却认为“不是时候”，又转而拥护岑春煊讨袁，接着则又拥护段祺瑞反对孙中山，主张参加第一次世界大战，以后又不断参与北洋军阀的混战。这就是研究系为反动军阀帮凶的历史。民社党今日的“领袖”张君劢（原名张嘉森，为张嘉林的胞兄）及他的不少同党，当时都是追随研究系梁启超的。现在则继续了梁启超的传统，在“保皇”“保袁”“保段”之后，又来保蒋。与张君劢同党的汤住心（就是汤芗铭）是研究系汤化龙的弟弟，是袁世凯时代的湖南督军，被湖南人民称之为“汤屠户”的。抗战时期，汤住心在北平做了汉奸，与在上海、南京领汪精卫政府的津贴的曾琦，成为民社、青年两党遥遥相对的南北二汉奸。应该记着：当去年重庆新华日报宣布汤为汉奸时，蒋介石的中央日报却说他是“抗敌不屈”，张君劢亦曾为他狡辩过。可是北平人民没有不知道汤芗铭是个大汉奸的。这次代表民社党加入蒋政府为“国府委员”的戢翼翘，更是人所共知的北洋军阀奉系余孽。他是什么时候和研究系（或国社党）发生了关系，无人得知。但他现在居然一跃而为民社党的组织部长，并且成为“国府委员”，这真要使那些尚未死掉的北洋军阀余孽自愧不如，也无怪没有得到“府委”的另一军阀余孽汤芗铭要与张君劢火并了。
    张君劢除了集合海外保皇党、国内研究系和汉奸军阀外，还有在他左右不离的两个集团：一个是家属集团，即他的兄弟姐妹亲戚，这是推动他拥蒋的一群蒋家官吏；另一个是徒弟集团，代表人物为他的徒弟蒋匀田，一心一意要过官瘾。所以民社党只是一个保皇党、汉奸、军阀、家属、徒弟的集团，恰恰也是中国封建士大夫中最腐朽的一群。他既没有广大的社会基础，又不能代表任何真正自由主义的思想，连民社党内张君劢的反对派也公开指责张为一个反自由主义的独裁者。他们之所以如此急于参加反动的蒋政府，无非是看到自己阶级的日趋没落，想以“保蒋”来支撑一番。但其结果将与当年保皇党、研究系之“保皇”“保袁”“保段”一样得到同样悲惨的下场。（新华社陕北二十九日电）
    青年党
    第一次世界大战后，在半殖民地的中国，青年知识分子由于感到民族的危亡，遂发生了两种情形：一种是认识了人民力量伟大，从事革命运动以求民族的解放；另一种则是承袭了封建买办传统与剥削思想，梦想在废墟上维持其权威的统治，结果只有走上反动卖国的途径。前一种是中共及进步分子大多数人所走的道路，后一种就是青年党极少数人所走的道路。所以不管中国青年党的领导者怎样夸耀他们也出身于“五四”运动，也曾参加过爱国运动，但当他们一开始组党时，即与中国的进步分子走了相反的道路。青年党的纲领与口号是“外抗强权，内除国贼”，但他们所抗的“强权”，不是侵略中国的帝国主义，而是以平等待我之苏联；他们要除的“国贼”，不是当时危害中国卖国残民的北洋军阀，而是领导当时国共合作的孙中山及共产党。他们称颂反革命的陈炯明的“联省自治”，反对孙中山的国民革命。孙中山在其革命的国民党第一次代表大会宣言上所指斥的国家主义派就是他们。他们的党魁曾琦，在法国时写过这样两句诗：“克雷蒙梭是吾师，朴恩凯莱更不疑。”克雷蒙梭与朴恩凯莱都是第一次世界大战前后法国的帝国主义者，十足代表其军国主义的思想。他更特别称赞“青年土耳其党”的反共成绩，所以该党的外文名字原来就是“青年中国党”。当时在法国的曾琦、李璜、何鲁之之徒，每当华侨群众集会时，总是大摆其绅士臭架子，不屑与中国工人及贫苦学生为伍；与当时在法国的贫困组织，恰成为两个阶级的显明对垒。曾琦等回国与左舜生、陈启天、余家菊等办“醒狮”报时，公开站在陈炯明、赵恒惕反革命“联省自治”方面，反对孙中山的三大政策，成为当时青年群众所最反对的反动集团，大家都呼他们为“狮子狗”。从此以后，青年党就一直依附于各地军阀。不论北方的吴佩孚、张作霖、阎锡山、孙传芳，或是南方的陈炯明、刘湘等等，他们都投身投靠过。“五卅”运动的时候，他们是英国帝国主义的公开走狗。在蒋介石反动统治建立之后，他们又采取两面政策，一面以曾琦等留在北方专门勾结反蒋的军阀，另一方面左舜生却在南京充当蒋系政治学校的教官。所以，抗战后左舜生在重庆高谈“抗战”，而曾琦则跑到上海、南京去作汉奸，与梁鸿志诗酒唱和，想在汪精卫那里谋得一官半职。后来左舜生在重庆高谈“反蒋独裁”，而李璜又在四川领取国民党政府的津贴；甚至左舜生本人在同一时期也领取国民党军事委员会的“特费”。由此可见他们的这种两面政策是以反动为主，以私人利害为依归的。当张学良部下的某青年党员揭发青年党勾结日寇时，曾琦等的党羽便立即加以暗杀。当国民党极力分化民主同盟时，曾琦、左舜生便首先领取津贴，出卖民盟。
    青年党这种卖友求荣、卖国媚外的卑鄙行为，是有其思想根源的。他们在近百年的历史人物中，一向是崇拜曾国藩、李鸿章、梁启超，而鄙薄革命党人的，左舜生特别称赞李鸿章的卖国外交。在参政会中，左舜生曾赞成汪精卫的“和平”主张。而现在为左舜生所主持的《中华时报》，更公开主张亲美帝国主义。青年党中委而现为蒋政府行政院政务委员的常燕生，在该党成都机关报《新中国日报》上写文章，主张中国女人应该去做吉普女郎，以便吸收外国血统，据说这样可以“强种强国”，其无耻的程度真是令人咋舌。
    这一群反动的知识分子、汉奸、小官僚集团，其历史从头到尾都是丑恶无耻的。青年党在整批的卖给国民党后，便出现了另一个青年党的中央委员会；这个新中央委员会的人物，自己承认曾奉曾（琦）左（舜生）李（璜）之命，参加过汪精卫的伪政府。这批新中央委员会的人物其背后是由国民党的“复兴系”支持着的；而曾琦、左舜生、李璜等则由“ＣＣ”及“政学系”支持着。两个青年党的斗争，同时又反映着“ＣＣ”与“复兴”的斗争。青年党的这种丑态，与民社党中汤芗铭派之反对张君劢派可谓一模一样。
