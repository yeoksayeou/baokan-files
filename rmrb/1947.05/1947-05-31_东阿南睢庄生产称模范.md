(Reported by this newspaper from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region on the 29th) Nan Suizhuang is a model village in Dong'a, with excellent work in all areas, especially the combination of production and other tasks, which is done very well. The Sixth Prefectural Committee has praised it and called on all villages to learn from it. This village is a small village of only eighty households with three hundred and seventy people, located on the southwest bank of the Yellow River in the Third District. During the busy farming season, they combine war service and production. Everyone believes that after the land reform, each person has more land, but there is less labor. War service must be done, and production must be carried out, so only mutual assistance and specific division of labor are possible. Thirty-two young adults form four teams, taking turns carrying stretchers and guarding the river defenses. The rest jointly cultivate the land and manage the village cooperative. The village chief and militia captain take turns leading the stretcher teams, while the head of the Farmers' Association and the head of the Women's Association lead land reform and production. All the village's livestock is organized into four teams to plow the land. Regardless of who owns the spring land, the families of soldiers and stretcher bearers are plowed first in order. Their work point recording method is based on the amount of land cultivated. Those who owe work points must make up for them with labor or grain, and accounts are settled every two months. They are afraid of laziness, so they ensure regular inspections and establish a merit list in the village office, praising good deeds at any time. Their cooperative has a timber group, a cotton ginning group, and a grocery group, which are organized by the head of the Farmers' Association. The grocery group buys and sells oil, salt, matches, and paper, adjusting the daily necessities of the masses. Buying and selling at the cooperative is convenient and cheap, and the families of soldiers and the poor can buy on credit, settling accounts monthly with a profit split of 20/80. The operators receive 20% (without free meals), and the members receive 80%. Last year, they earned 60,000 yuan, exceeding the capital by seven times. Usually, very few people go to the market; they all buy and sell at the cooperative.

　　东阿南睢庄生产称模范
    【本报冀鲁豫二十九日电】南睢庄是东阿的模范村，各种工作都很好，特别是生产与其他工作的结合，做得很不错，六地委曾经表扬并号召各村向其学习。这村是三区西南黄河缘下仅有八十户三百七十口人的小村子，在农忙时，他们把战勤和生产结合起来，大家认为土地改革后，每人合的就多了，劳动力少了，战勤要做，生产要搞，只有进行互助和具体分工。青壮年三十二人组成四个班，轮流抬担架和负责看守河防，其余合伙耕种和经营村里的合作社。村长自卫队长轮流带担架，农会长妇会长领导土地改革生产，将全村的牲口组成四犋犁地，凡是春地不分谁的，先给军属担架夫依次犁完。他们的记工办法，按种地多少记工，欠工的还工或还粮，两月结账。他们恐怕长了出滑工，确定随时检查，在村的办公室建立功劳榜，好的随时表扬。他们的合作社有一个木料组，一个轧花组，一个杂货组，由农会长负责组合，杂货组买卖油盐火纸等，调剂群众生活必需品，合作社买东西方便又便宜，军属穷人可以赊账，一月一结账，二八分红，经营人分十分之二（不吃公饭），社员分十之八，去年赚洋六万元，超过本钱七倍。平常他们很少人赶集，都是在合作社里买卖。
