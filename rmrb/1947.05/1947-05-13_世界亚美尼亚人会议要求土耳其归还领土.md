Zovigian, chairman of the Armenian Democratic Liberal Party of America, reported that the main purpose of the conference was to fight for the liberation of lost Armenian territories and their reintegration into beautiful Soviet Armenia. The conference lasted four days, and at the closing ceremony, a mass rally of 3,000 people unanimously passed a resolution urging United Nations agencies to fairly resolve the Armenian people's demands regarding the Armenian provinces occupied by Turkey.  The Soviet Armenian Republic is located in the southern part of the Transcaucasus region, bordering Turkey to its southwest.
