Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th: TASS, New York—Hollerith, formerly of the Office of Price Administration, wrote in the magazine "Democratic Digest" that consumers paid an extra $80 billion due to soaring prices since the abolition of price controls in the summer of 1946. Hollerith refuted the excuse of many businessmen that rising prices were due to increased wages, pointing out that real wages have indeed fallen sharply, while profits have increased enormously. Hollerith also said: According to figures from the latest National Bank Gazette, the total profits of 385 industrial conglomerates this spring reached $670.8 million, while the total profits last spring were only $290.8 million. Some business representatives have expressed their fear that rising price levels will damage mass purchasing power and lead to an economic crisis.

　　美国物价腾贵实际工资降低
    【新华社陕北十一日电】塔斯社纽约讯：前在物价管制局工作之荷勒士在《民主文摘》杂志上撰文，指出自一九四六年到夏季物价管制废除后，消费者因物价高涨多付出了八十万万元。荷氏驳斥许多商业家说物价腾贵是由于工资增加的托词，指出实际的工资确已大大低降，而利润却巨量地增加了。荷氏并谓：根据上期国家银行公报的数字，三百八十五家工业组合公司今年春季的总利润共达六万万七千零八十万元，而去年春季的总利润不过二万万九千零八十万元。某些商业界代表表示他们恐惧物价水平升高将损害大众购买力，并引致经济危机。
