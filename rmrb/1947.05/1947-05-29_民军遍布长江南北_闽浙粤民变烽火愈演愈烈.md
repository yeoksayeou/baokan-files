Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th: According to combined reports from Shanghai newspapers in March and April, the armed forces of the people's uprisings in the KMT-controlled areas have spread to Xiangshan, Ninghai, Taizhou Bay, Oujiang along the coast of Zhejiang, Longquan, Zhenhai, Yuyao, Ningbo in eastern Zhejiang, and Tongxiang, Chongde, and the suburbs of Hangzhou in western Zhejiang. The People's Army in Xiangshan has over a hundred people, possessing two machine guns, dozens of rifles and pistols, and more than ten grenade launchers. The People's Army in the suburbs of Hangzhou has over a hundred people, with sophisticated equipment and a strict organization. On March 27th, they once attacked the police stationed in Keshu, ten miles from the city, shocking the Chiang Kai-shek's officers and soldiers. The People's Army active in Taihu Lake, Jiangsu, has been difficult to eliminate despite repeated "suppression" by the KMT army. It is reported that there are currently more than sixty steel-plated boats on the lake, with more than three hundred people. People's Army activities also exist in Changshu, Fengxian and other places. The People's Army in Fanchang area of ​​Southern Anhui, led by Wang Wenshi, has formed the "Southern Fanchang General Headquarters". Its strength is such that the KMT local armed forces cannot "suppress" it. In the Midian area on the border of Sichuan and Yunnan, seventy to eighty members of the People's Army have been discovered, most of whom are unemployed officers and soldiers, possessing more than twenty machine guns, sophisticated equipment, and sufficient ammunition. The KMT organs in Lufeng, ten miles from Midden, have all been evacuated.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th: The Shanghai Dagongbao revealed that the People's Armed Forces in South China are growing stronger under the KMT's "suppression". The main force of the People's Armed Forces in Hainan Island has more than three thousand people (not including local armed forces). The relationship between the military and the people is extremely harmonious, and the complex terrain is extremely conducive to guerrilla warfare. Cai Jinjun, the KMT's Ninth Special Commissioner for Guangdong Province (i.e., Hainan Island), had his plan to "suppress" the island by the end of April completely bankrupt. The People's Armed Forces have instead become stronger as the KMT army's "suppression" has dispersed them to various places, especially in Chengshui and Lingao counties. Cai Jinjun had to say that he would no longer set a time limit for suppression, but only decided to "suppress" continuously. The KMT Guangdong Provincial Council telegraphed the KMT Ministry of National Defense on the 28th of last month, requesting that at least two divisions of the main force and warships be sent to suppress it, but the Ministry of National Defense replied on the 3rd that "there are no troops to send." In Fujian Province, the People's Armed Forces in April have expanded to seven counties including Gutian, Pingnan, and Putian. The flames of the People's Uprising in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River are also intensifying. In the suburbs of Yichang, the gateway to Sichuan Province, there are more than two thousand people in the People's Armed Forces. Yichang has declared martial law. Small groups of People's Armed Forces have been discovered repeatedly outside Wuhu. The KMT army fears that the green gauze tent will rise on the plains of Southern Anhui, and the People's Armed Forces will become more intense, so they forcibly cut down sorghum, corn, and other crops within two miles on both sides of the Jingwu (Wuhu), Wutun (Tunxi), and Wuqing (Yang) highways.

　　民军遍布长江南北
    闽浙粤民变烽火愈演愈烈
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】综合三、四月份沪报讯：蒋管区民变武装已遍及浙江沿海之象山、宁海、台洲湾、瓯江、浙东之龙泉、镇海、余姚、宁波，及浙西之桐乡、崇德、杭州市郊等地。象山民军百余人，拥有机枪两挺，长短枪数十枝，榴弹筒十余颗。杭州市郊民军百余人，装备精良，组织严密。三月二十七日曾一度袭击距城十里之渴墅驻防警察，蒋家官兵大为震惊。活跃江苏太湖之民军，虽经蒋军数次“进剿”，终难收效。据悉：湖上现有钢板划子六十余只，拥有三百余人。其他常熟、奉贤等地亦有民军之活动。皖南繁昌一带民军由王文石领导，已组成“南繁总指挥部”，实力之大，已使蒋记地方武装无法“清剿”。川滇边境米甸一带，发现民军七八十人，多系失业官兵，拥有机枪二十余挺，装备精良，弹药充足。距米甸十里之鸬丰蒋记机关，均已疏散躲避。
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】沪大公报透露：华南民变武装在蒋军“清剿”下日益壮大。海南岛人民武装主力有三千余人（地方武装尚不在内），军民关系极为融洽，又加地形复杂，极有利于游击战。蒋记粤省第九专员区（即海南岛）专员蔡劲军，原定四月底“肃清”该岛之计划，已完全破产。人民武装反因蒋军进“剿”分散至各地而更形强大，尤以澄遂、临高两县为最，蔡劲军也不得不称，以后不再限期肃清，只决定不断的“剿”。蒋记广东参议会上月二十八日曾电请蒋国防部至少派主力两个师及兵舰前往镇压，但国防部三日复称：“无兵可派”。闽省四月份民变武装已扩展至古田、屏南、浦田等七个县。长江中段民变烽火亦愈演愈烈。川省门户之宜昌近郊，有人民武装二千余人，宜昌已宣布戒严，芜湖郊外迭次发现小股民变武装。蒋军畏惧皖南平原青沙帐起，民变武装将更激烈，竟将京芜（湖）、芜屯（溪）、芜青（阳）等公路两侧二里内高粱、王蜀黍等庄稼，强行割去。
