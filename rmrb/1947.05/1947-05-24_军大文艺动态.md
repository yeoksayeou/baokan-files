　　Army University Literary and Art Activities
   (1) During the Army University's intensive military training, the troops' literary and artistic activities are exceptionally lively and play a significant role. The drama performances are as bustling as the political study periods and have new developments. They have gained some experience in "performing military exercises" and have made preliminary summaries.
    (2) In order to reduce the organizational structure and support the front lines, the Army University Art Troupe was ordered to disband in January of this year. The focus of literary and artistic work has shifted to the company level. Because some experience was gained last winter, the development has been extremely rapid since March. Whether it's military or political study, writing and performing dramas has become an easy and quick task. Even students who have just arrived at the school can perform good plays with great educational significance.
    (3) The Army University Frontline慰問团（comfort delegation） will go to the front line for慰問（consolation） starting in early May and plans to perform lantern slides at the front line with innovative programs such as the history of the Eighth Route Army. (Liyun)

　　军大文艺动态
   （一）军大在大练兵中，部队文艺活跃异常，起作用亦甚大。戏剧演出和政治学习时期一样热闹，且有新发展，在“演兵”上已摸到一点经验，并经初步总结。
    （二）为了缩减机构支援前线，军大文工队已于今年一月奉令结束，文艺工作重点转向连队，因去冬已取得一些经验，三月来发展极速，不论军事政治学习，编演戏剧已成轻而易举之快事，甚至刚到校之学生，也能演出十分有教育意义的好戏。
    （三）军大前线慰问团五月上旬起赴前线慰问，并拟在前线出演幻灯，内容有八路军的历史等新颖节目。（立云）
