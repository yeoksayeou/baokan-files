　　Xingtai Masses Resolutely Fight Drought
  　Repairing Canals, Watering Fields, Protecting Seedlings
  　County Government Calls for Thrift and Continued Planting
    [This newspaper, Xingtai] At the beginning of May, the Xingtai County expanded meeting of all county cadres determined that the central task at that time was to have all county and district cadres fully organize the masses to carry water to plant cotton within four or five days. It was proposed that completing the cotton planting was the key to the entire production plan, and at the same time, it was a prerequisite for carrying out the textile movement, calling for full and unreserved organization to launch a cotton planting campaign. At that time, the masses' thinking was: in the past, they did not have the habit of planting cotton, they were afraid of not planting it well, and they did not dare to plant more; at the same time, they believed that if it did not rain, the cotton would not sprout, and some even said that the higher authorities called for more planting, which would require more from the masses. According to the above-mentioned mass thinking, the approach at that time was to give the masses a specific account. One was to determine how much cotton a village should plant according to the needs of the masses, how much cloth each person, each household, and each village needed to wear; on the other hand, to calculate the harvest of cotton planting, one mu of cotton can top the harvest of five mu of other crops, thus getting through the masses' thinking. For example, Changxin Village in the Second District only planted more than 200 mu at the beginning. After calculating the accounts, they planted more than 100 mu more. Ze Village planted very little at the beginning. After calculating the accounts, they planted more than 100 mu more. Because the thinking was clear, the masses also made many creations in the method of planting cotton. For example, Xianxian Village in the Third District, when planting flowers, was afraid that they would not sprout if they were planted during the day, so they only pulled the water tank to the field, filled it with water, and then planted it in the morning. In this way, the entire county organized all its labor to carry water to plant seeds on the basis of voluntary combination, and quickly created a craze. According to statistics, the entire county planted a total of 39,739 mu of cotton; in the use of labor, such as the 560 groups in the Sixth District, 3,020 people participated. Strong laborers carried water, and women, children, and the elderly dug pits and dripped seeds. They completed the planting of 16,000 mu of cotton in seven days. After completing the cotton planting, it still did not rain, and seeing that the cotton seedlings were about to be damaged by the sun, the masses in each district quickly came up with a solution and immediately began to repair canals, using all available water to irrigate the fields. For example, Nanzhang Village in the Second District newly dug a four-li-long river, which can irrigate 1,000 mu of land. Sujiatun also turned most of the dry land into paddy fields, which can avoid carrying water to plant seeds, save labor, and prevent drought for a long time. In Dongxianxian Village, the Third District, the flower seedlings had already come out at that time, but because it did not rain, they were about to die from drought. The village cadres immediately proposed: "This year's wheat harvest will be reduced, so we must carry water to irrigate and protect the cotton seedlings to compensate for the wheat's poor harvest." The masses in the entire village immediately responded to the call and began to take action. Now the entire village is carrying water to irrigate the flowers, and many other villages have also begun to carry water to irrigate the flowers. According to these situations, the county government, on the one hand, introduced the drought prevention experience of the old liberated areas, and at the same time called on county and district cadres to make contributions to the people in drought prevention, to take the lead and lead drought prevention, and issued an emergency drought prevention call to the masses of the county: (1) Build water conservancy projects to expand the irrigated area. (2) Carry water to plant sorghum and corn, and advocate planting seedlings in wheat ridges. (3) Save food and clothing, make every drop count, prevent disaster years, and don't forget the hundreds of famines when you are full. (4) Carry water to irrigate the flowers to ensure that the existing cotton seedlings do not die from drought. (Wang Zhu, Yao Xi, Xiao Ping)

　　邢台群众坚决抗旱
  　修渠浇地保护幼苗
  　县府号召省吃俭用继续点种
    【本报邢台讯】邢台县五月初全县干部扩大会上，确定当时中心工作是在四、五天内所有县区干部全力组织群众担水点棉，提出完成种棉是全部生产计划的关键，同时又是开展纺织运动的先决条件，号召全力放手的组织起来，突击种棉。当时群众思想是：过去没有种棉习惯，怕种不好，不敢多种，同时认为天不下雨，种上也出不来，有的还说上级叫多种，会给群众要的多。根据以上群众思想，当时的做法是给群众算具体账，一个是按群众需要，每人每户每村需要穿多少布，来确定一个村该种多少棉花；另一方面拿种棉的收成来算，一亩棉花能顶其它庄稼五亩收成，这样打通了群众思想。如二区长信村在开始只种了二百余亩，经过算账又多种了一百多亩。泽村在开始种的很少，经过算账后又多种一百多亩。由于打通了思想，群众在种棉办法上也有不少创造。如三区先贤村在种花时，怕白天种不出来，只把水缸拉到地里，灌上水，到早晨再种，这样，使全县都在自愿结合的基础上把全部劳力组织到担水点种上来，很快造成一个热潮，据统计全县共种棉花三万九千七百三十九亩；在劳力使用上，如六区五百六十个组参加了三千零二十人，强劳力担水，妇女小孩老弱刨坑灌滴籽，七天即完成种棉一万六千亩。完成种棉后，天仍不下雨，眼看要晒坏棉苗，各区群众又很快想出办法，立即开始修渠，利用所有可用的水，进行浇田。如二区南张村新挖河道四里长，能浇一千亩地，苏家屯也将大部旱地都变成水田，可以免去担水点种，又省工又可以长期防旱。三区东先贤村当时花苗都已出来，因为天不下雨，眼看就要旱死，村干部马上提出：“今年麦子要减收了，咱们要担水浇，保护棉苗来补偿麦子的歉收。”全村群众立即响应号召，开始行动，现全村都在担水浇花，另外不少村也都开始担水浇花。县府根据这些情况，一面介绍老区防旱经验，同时号召县区干部在防旱中为人民立功，都要亲自动手，领导防旱，并向全县群众发出防旱紧急号召：（１）兴修水利，扩大浇地面积。（２）担水点种高粱、玉茭，并提倡麦垄安苗。（３）省吃俭用，细水长流，防备灾年，一饱不要忘了百饥。（４）担水浇花，保证不旱死现有棉苗。（忘珠、耀西、小平）
