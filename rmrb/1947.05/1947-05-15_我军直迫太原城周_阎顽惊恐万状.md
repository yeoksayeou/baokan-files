Xinhua News Agency, Lvliang, 12th. Yan Xishan in Taiyuan is distraught over the situation in Shanxi. All newspapers are screaming "Taiyuan is in danger." Merchants and civilians are fleeing, hoarding goods instead of money, and prices are skyrocketing. The Yan Xishan's Yangqu County government, formerly located in Huangtuzhai, sixty li north of Taiyuan, has retreated into the city. Fifty li north of the city, in Lancun, Yan's army searchlights are shining all night long. Yan Xishan has issued several "top secret" documents for the defense of Taiyuan, such as "Instructions for the Self-Defense of the People within Taiyuan," neurotically ordering his lackeys to "suspect everyone and suspect everything." A curfew is imposed in the urban area at night, and secret agents and police are swarming the streets. A merchant named Liu has been interrogated twenty-seven times in ten days. Landlords and local bullies who fled from the liberated areas and hate land reform are blocked at Xiangtan Village in the northern suburbs and are not allowed to enter the city. The city has become a world of bunkers, with gun holes and shelters dug everywhere in the city walls. There is a ring road for vehicles inside the city, and bunkers are everywhere on the streets. Outside the city, there are ring-shaped secret trenches, ring-shaped bunkers, ring-shaped large trenches, and a ring-shaped railway that is being rushed to construct a so-called "hundred-li defense line." The Yan's troops on the outer lines are even more flustered. Yan's troops in Jiexiu and Jiaocheng are rushing to repair the city walls and outer moats. However, this cannot boost their internal courage. A deputy regimental commander of Yan's 72nd Division said while repairing the city, "Whether we repair it or not, what's the use when the Eighth Route Army comes?" Also, Yan Xishan was greatly dismayed by the development of the war in northern Shaanxi. The Taiyuan Appeasement Headquarters' newspaper, "Battlefront Daily," admitted in an editorial that the withdrawal from Yan'an by the Liberated Areas was a planned abandonment. It said that the PLA's tactics are good at calculating and preserving their main force. It is now clear that they have taken the initiative. The newspaper described the awkward situation of Chiang Kai-shek's and Hu Zongnan's troops in northern Shaanxi, saying, "If we (referring to Chiang's army) garrison northern Shaanxi with a large army, we will invisibly prevent a part of our forces from actively moving. On the contrary, the Communist army can actively move everywhere. Soon, the Communist army will definitely make a comeback and launch a large-scale counter-offensive. The crisis in northern Shaanxi can erupt at any time." The newspaper expressed pessimism about the overall future, saying, "When can they be wiped out? It is really hard to predict."

　　我军直迫太原城周
    阎顽惊恐万状
    【新华社吕梁十二日电】太原阎顽对山西战局惊惶失措。各报均狂叫“太原危急”。商民则纷纷迁避，都存货不存钱，物价飞涨不已。原在太原城北六十里黄土寨的阎顽阳曲县政府已缩入市内，城北五十里兰村阎军探照灯彻夜照射。阎锡山连日颁发保卫太原“极机密”文件多种，如“保卫太原对城内民众自卫的指示”，神经质的要其喽罗“对人人怀疑，事事怀疑。”市区入夜即行戒严，特务警宪涌现街头。刘姓商人十天中曾受盘查二十七次。仇视土地改革的解放区逃亡奸霸地主均被阻于北郊香檀村，不准进城。该市已成碉堡世界，城墙遍挖枪眼、掩体，城内有环城汽道，街头碉堡林立。城外尚有环城暗壕、环城碉堡、环城大壕，环城铁路现正赶修所谓“百里防线”。外围各线阎顽更手忙脚乱，介休交城等地阎军均抢修城垣外壕。惟此并不能为其内部壮胆，阎军七十二师某副团长在修城时即称：“修不修，八路军来了顶啥用？”又：阎顽对陕北战局发展亦大惊失色。太原绥署机关报“阵中日报”社论供认解放区撒出延安系有计划的放弃。谓解放军战法是精于算帐，保存主力。目前显然已转入主动，该报描写蒋胡军在陕北之尴尬处境称：“如果我（指蒋军）以大军驻守陕北，无形中使我一部兵力不能主动的活动。相反的共军则可遍地的主动活动，不久共军必然卷土重来，大举反攻，陕北危机随时都可爆发。”该报对整个前途表示悲观说：“何时能够剿灭，实在难以预卜”。
