　　After Fucheng (Xin County, north of the Longhai Railway) was recovered, a warm "revenge grain return" movement swept the county. During the period of enemy occupation, some bad landlords relied on enemy power to unreasonably reverse the fruits of the peasants' labor. In Xuzhai, the Eighth District, the masses were forced by landlords to sell their belongings in order to return the fruits to the landlords; many members of the Peasants' Association were arrested and beaten, suffering great bullying. After the county was recovered, the masses' demands for revenge and grain return were very urgent, but at first there were still thoughts of things changing, causing the landlords to still be active in the villages, threatening the masses. In response to this situation, the leadership decided to strongly support the masses and carried out the following work: First, carry out widespread propaganda, post notices, and use market days to hold various meetings, clearly stating that if landlords illegally demanded anything from the masses after the enemy and puppet occupation, it must be returned to the masses. Call on people to take revenge for their grievances and return the grain; Second, the government resolutely supported the masses, arrested bad landlords, and severely dealt with those who committed heinous crimes according to the opinions of the masses; Third, cadres expressed their attitude to the masses, resolutely guaranteeing to share life and death with the masses under any circumstances. After the Liqiao traitor landlord (name omitted) and Yuan Hanhua from Yu Lao's family were executed in the Seventh District, a grain return movement quickly swept the entire district; in the Eighth District, the landlords of Erzhai and Liuzhai kowtowed to the masses at the peasants' meeting and made written guarantees. The masses became even more active, and the grain return movement became a roaring success. According to incomplete statistics, three districts in the county have already returned 295,946 catties of autumn grain, 29,183 catties of wheat, 4,453 catties of cotton, five head of livestock, ten sheep, and 18.59 million yuan in local currency to the peasants.

　　[Our newspaper's Ji-Lu-Yu branch, dated 19th] In the anti-reverse land and grain and revenge movement in Hua County, the militia have developed and recovered one after another. The Luzhai Village originally had forty militiamen. Since the Chiang Kai-shek troops occupied the village last year, except for a small number of militiamen who followed the troops, all the others were forced to stop their activities. In this turning-over and revenge movement, the young and middle-aged people have asked to re-establish a model class to protect their fields and lives. More than 50 people have signed up, and they are still continuing to participate. They work day and night, distributing floating wealth and fruits during the day, and exercising and running. At night, they stand guard, watch over the bad guys, and their mood is extremely high.

　　[Also reported] The masses in the marginal areas of the county have risen up one after another to establish joint defenses, with villages guarding and monitoring the landlords. Zhang Jishuan, a traitorous landlord from Zhanghu Village, colluded with the home-returning corps in Changyuan City and killed three militiamen on March 14th of the lunar calendar, robbing five head of livestock. The broad masses of people were even more resentful of the bad landlords. Sixteen villages in the entire community, under the slogan of protecting lives and fields, armed themselves to monitor the landlords and ambushed the puppet stragglers, forming a mass blockade line.

　　复程收复区开展复仇还粮运动
    【本报冀鲁豫廿三日电】复程（新县，陇海路北）收复后，全县掀起热烈的“复仇还粮”运动。该县在沦陷期间，有些坏蛋地主依靠敌势，将农民所得果实无理倒回。八区徐砦的群众，被地主逼的把东西卖掉，来倒给地主果实；许多农会员被逮捕殴打，备受欺凌。该县收复后，群众复仇还粮之要求非常迫切，但起初仍存在变天思想，致使地主还在村内活动，威胁群众。根据此种情况，领导上决定大力为群众撑腰，进行了以下的工作：一、开展刮大风的宣传，张贴布告，利用集市召开各种会议，明确提出敌伪占领后，如地主非法索去群众的东西，一律归还群众。号召有仇报仇，倒粮还粮；二、政府坚决为群众撑腰，逮捕坏地主，罪大恶极的依群众意见严格处理；三、干部向群众表示态度，坚决保证在任何情况下，和群众同生死共患难。七区枪毙了李桥奸霸地主（×××）和虞老家的袁韩化后，全区很快掀起还粮运动；八区而砦刘砦的地主，在农民大会上，向群众叩头，立字找保，群众更加积极，还粮运动搞的轰轰烈烈。据目前不完全的统计，全县三个区已有二十九万五千九百四十六斤秋粮，二万九千一百八十三斤麦子，四千四百五十三斤棉花，五头牲口，十头羊，本钞一千八百五十九万元，均回到农民手里。
    【本报冀鲁豫十九日电】滑县在反倒地倒粮与复仇运动中，民兵纷纷发展与恢复。路砦村原有四十个民兵，自去年蒋军进占后，除少数民兵随部队行动外，其余全被迫停止活动，这次翻身复仇运动中，青壮年纷纷要求重新成立模范班，起来保田保命，报名者已达五十余人，现仍继续参加中。他们昼夜不息的工作，白天搞浮财分果实、下操跑步，夜间站岗放哨看管坏蛋，情绪极为高涨。
    【又讯】该县边缘区群众纷纷奋起成立联防，村村站岗放哨监视地主。张户回村奸霸地主张记拴勾结长垣城内还乡团，于旧历三月十四日，打死民兵三人，抢去牲口五头。广大群众对坏蛋地主更为愤恨。全小区十六个村庄，在保命保田的口号下武装起来，监视地主，并设伏打击伪顽，组成群众性的封锁线。
