Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th: Since April, prices and foreign exchange rates in various liberated areas have plummeted along with the glorious victories of the People's Liberation Army. In the Second Sub-district of Central Jiangsu, prices have fallen by one to two times. Taking Xinghua's Zouzhen as an example, rice has fallen from 250 yuan to 120 yuan per pound, meat from 3,000 yuan to 1,000 yuan, and homespun cloth from 440,000 yuan to 150,000 yuan per bolt. In the Jianghuai Yancheng area of Northern Jiangsu, rice has fallen from 260 yuan to 170 yuan per pound, a decrease of about 35%, breaking the past convention that grain prices would rise by more than 20% in the spring. In Jin-Cha-Ji, the highest rice price in Tangxian was 96 yuan per pound, while in the Yanbei area it was only 42 yuan. Prices in the coastal areas of Jiaodong and the Bohai Sea region have fallen by one-fifth. In Central Jiangsu, gold has fallen from 500,000 yuan to 180,000 yuan. In Jinnan, Handan City has fallen from 98,000 yuan to 95,000 yuan, and Linqing is below 90,000 yuan. People in the Jiang-occupied areas are driving out Jiang currency everywhere. Businessmen in Anyang are storing goods and US dollars. Along the Ping-Han Railway, in Gaoyi and Tangyin (before liberation), 15 yuan of Jiang currency could not be exchanged for one yuan of Ji currency. In the liberated areas of Yantai, Weihaiwei, and other places, although the exchange rate between the border currency and the Jiang currency was set by the liberated area bank at 1 to 15, no one was interested. Jinnan drafts also continued to fall, with the Linqing-Tianjin draft falling from 1,200 yuan to 1,000 yuan, the Linqing-Jinan draft falling from 1,100 yuan to 930 yuan, and the Hengshui draft continuing to fall from 2,200 yuan in March to 1,400 yuan, and is still falling.

　　随着解放军光辉胜利
    解放区各地物价下降
    【新华社陕北十一日电】四月份以来，各解放区物价、外汇，随着人民解放军的光辉胜利，猛烈下跌。苏中二分区物价下跌一倍至二倍，以兴化邹镇为例，大米每斤由二百五十元跌至一百二十元，肉由三千元跌至一千元，土布每条由四十四万元跌至十五万元。苏北将后盐阜区大米每斤由二百六十元跌至百七十元，约跌百分之三十五，打破以往春季粮价必涨百分之二十以上惯例。晋察冀米价最高之唐县每斤为九十六元，雁北一带则仅四十二元。胶东沿海及渤海区物价下降五分之一。苏中黄金由五十万元跌至十八万元。冀南邯市由九万八千元跌至九万五千元，临清在九万元以下。蒋占区人民则到处驱逐蒋币。安阳商人纷纷存储货物与美钞，平汉沿线的高邑、汤阴（未解放时）十五元蒋币换不到一元冀币。在解放区烟台威海卫等地，边币与蒋币比值虽由解放区银行规定为一比十五，但亦无人问津。冀南汇票亦继续下落，临清津汇由一千二百元跌至一千元，济汇由一千一百元跌至九百三十元，衡水已由三月份之二千二百元继续下跌至千四百元，现仍在下跌中。
