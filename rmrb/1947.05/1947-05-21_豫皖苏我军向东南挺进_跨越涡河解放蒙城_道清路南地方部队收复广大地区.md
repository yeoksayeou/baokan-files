　　Our YuWanSu Army Advances Southeast
    Crossing the Wo River to Liberate Mengcheng
    Local Troops South of the Daocing Railway Recover Vast Areas
    [Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] The YuWanSu People's Liberation Army crossed the Wo River in northern Anhui and liberated Xiyangji in Woyang County on the 1st, annihilating the Chiang Kai-shek regime's Jing Gongsu, capturing 30 people and their weapons. On the 4th, the unit continued its advance along the south bank of the Wo River, penetrating deep into the flanks of the Chiang army, and in one fell swoop liberated Mengcheng, annihilating two companies of the Chiang Kai-shek's Security Regiment and one battalion of the Mengcheng Security Regiment. The Chiang Kai-shek's Mengcheng County Government was also completely taken care of by our forces. Over 600 enemies were killed or captured, and the spoils included one mortar, three heavy machine guns, over ten light machine guns, over 400 rifles and carbines, two radio stations, and tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition.
    [Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Taihang, 19th] In the past month and a half, the situation south of the Daocing Railway has undergone significant changes. The Taihang local troops, in coordination with the YuBei Campaign, advanced south of the Daocing Railway, successively recovering Wenxian City and important strongholds such as Chongyi, Ningguo, and Dongcun, compressing the Chiang-puppet forces into a few isolated strongholds along the Qin (yang)-Bo (ai) highway and the Daocing Railway, and cutting the above two roads into several sections. In April, the local troops killed or wounded 765 Chiang-puppet troops and captured 402 alive. The broad masses of guerrillas and militia work teams, in conjunction with the local masses, captured "Homecoming Legions," "Reckoning" ringleaders, and scattered Chiang-puppet personnel everywhere, recovering vast areas. On the night of May 5th, a certain work team in Huojia, in conjunction with a unit of guerrillas from Wuzhi, raided Chengfeng, a central stronghold in the area occupied by Chiang's stubborn forces between Xin (xiang), Huo (jia), Wu (zhi), and Xiu (wu). Without firing a shot, they captured more than 20 members of the puppet self-defense corps and seized 13 long and short guns. In the newly recovered villages, a vigorous anti-"Reckoning" movement is underway, with eye-catching slogans such as "Take back our wheat fields" plastered all over the streets and towns. The masses smile at each other: "It's our world again!" (Picture attached)
