Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th. The Northwest Central Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party has issued instructions on spring plowing. The full text is as follows: To all local committees and county committees:

(I) The Kuomintang is attacking the border region with massive forces. We cannot crush the offensive without a long and serious war of self-defense. Now is the spring plowing season, but spring plowing has not yet started universally in various places. This is due to the enemy's offensive, the displacement of the masses in and near the war zones, and the lack of sufficient labor due to frequent wartime mobilizations. More importantly, it is because the leadership in various places has failed to grasp the organization of production and has not been able to combine the war of self-defense with production. This situation will cause the greatest difficulties for the border region. If it is delayed any further, and the spring plowing season is missed, it will inevitably affect the long-term support for the war of self-defense. We must call on the whole Party to pay close attention and oppose any excuse of being busy with the war or the dispersal of the masses to ignore and fail to lead production. The whole Party must be mobilized to organize the masses for spring plowing!

(II) All cadres must immediately go to various rural areas, especially to the rural areas in the war zones, to personally lead and organize the masses to rush to plow and sow. Do not let a single day pass. Even if there are only two or three people, organize them to produce. Use every minute of time and every bit of manpower to rush to sow every piece of land. Even if only the elderly, the weak, women, and children can be organized, striving to plant a few rows of pumpkins or a few plots of potatoes will greatly contribute to this year's food supply. All cadres and the masses must understand that this year's rushing to sow is not only for our own food, but also to defeat the enemy. This point should be repeatedly emphasized everywhere. Theaters and newspapers should publicize it greatly, mobilizing all possible labor forces to be used in production.

(III) This year's spring plowing, due to the enemy's attacks and destruction, is also a serious struggle with the enemy. It must be combined with the development of guerrilla warfare so that the militia and guerrilla teams are universally organized and active to harass the enemy, monitor the enemy, attack small groups of enemy soldiers who come to harass, capture enemy plainclothes teams, set up哨所 [sentry posts], and establish village-to-village joint defense, so that the masses can be protected and engage in production with peace of mind. At present, the urgent task of the militia and guerrilla teams is to protect spring plowing with arms. When the enemy comes, they should cover the masses to strengthen the walls and clear the fields, and when the enemy leaves, they should organize the masses to return to production. Only by organizing the masses to actively fight against the enemy can we seize every opportunity to rush to sow as much as possible.

(IV) This year's spring plowing should pay special attention to solving the problem of insufficient labor and the loss of production tools by the masses in the war zones. In addition to making wartime mobilization and service as reasonable as possible, using the people's strength sparingly, and strictly prohibiting the abuse of mobilization, it is especially necessary to earnestly organize labor mutual aid through the mass line. The first is to have a good division of labor and mutual assistance between war service and production, with some people going out to participate in the war and some people engaging in production at home, rotating and alternating, and exchanging labor with each other. Those at home should help those who have gone out to cultivate the land. For the masses who have fled from the enemy-occupied areas, those who can return should be organized to return to spring plowing, and those who cannot return should be resettled locally, adjusting public land or working with others to cultivate, so that they can engage in spring plowing or other sideline production. The areas passed by the enemy have suffered the greatest destruction, and some of the grain has been looted. The government must take practical measures to issue loans, lend grain, strengthen the work of cooperatives, and earnestly help the masses solve the difficulties in spring plowing. We should do this with the greatest sense of responsibility and effort, to closely unite the entire people to persist in resisting the enemy.

(V) All agencies, schools, and troops should, wherever they go, immediately extract manpower and animal power to help the masses rush to sow, setting an example for the masses and promoting their enthusiasm for production. (The people serving on the front lines, such as the stretcher teams, can also use their spare time to help the masses in the war zones produce.) Local agencies, schools, and troops should especially make the greatest efforts to carry out production and strive for self-sufficiency. Persisting in this year's self-sufficiency production is more important than in any previous year. As long as we can achieve self-sufficiency, we will defeat the enemy and be invincible.

The above should be thoroughly discussed and arranged by all units and all levels of the Party. The leading organs of each sub-region and each county must also have special personnel responsible for leading this work, and supervise and urge it at any time in order to implement it.

Northwest Bureau, April 28th

### 中共西北中央局关于春耕的指示  全党动员起来组织群众春耕！

　　中共西北中央局关于春耕的指示
    全党动员起来组织群众春耕！
    【新华社陕北九日电】中共西北中央局顷发布关于春耕的指示，全文如下：各地委、各县委：
    （一）国民党以巨大兵力进攻边区，我们非经过长期的严重的自卫战争不能粉碎进攻。此时正当春耕时期，但各地春耕还未普遍开始；这固然是由于敌军进攻，战区和附近群众流离不定，战时动员频繁劳动力不足，而更主要的是因为各地领导上对组织生产未能抓紧，不能把自卫战争和生产结合起来。此种情况将造成边区最大困难，倘再拖延下去，春耕失时，势必影响自卫战争的长期支持。必须提出全党深刻注意，反对任何借口战争忙或群众走散，而不去过问和领导生产。全党动员起来组织群众春耕！
    （二）所有干部必须立即到各个农村去，尤其要到战区农村去，亲自动手领导和组织群众抢耕、抢种。那怕是一天也不放过去，那怕三几个人也就组织三几个人生产。有一分时间，有一分人力，便抢种一分地。即使组织到老弱妇孺，争取种下几畦南瓜几分洋芋，就会对今年食粮起很大作用。要使所有干部和群众懂得：今年抢种不仅为了自己吃饭，而且还为了战胜敌人。这点应到处反复去讲，剧团、报纸大大宣传，动员一切可能参加劳动的力量都用到生产上。
    （三）今年春耕，因为敌人的进攻与破坏，又是一个与敌人的严重斗争，必须与开展游击战结合，使民兵游击队普遍组织和活动起来，困扰敌人，监视敌人，打击出来骚扰的小股敌兵，捕捉敌人便衣队，设立岗哨，村村联防，使群众获得掩护，安心生产。目前民兵游击队的紧要任务就是武装保卫春耕。敌来则掩护群众坚壁疏散，敌走则组织群众回来生产。只有组织群众积极的对敌斗争，才能争取一切机会抢种多种。
    （四）今年春耕应特别注意解决劳动力不足和战区群众损失生产工具问题。除极力使战时动员勤务做到合理，十分节用民力，严禁滥用动员外，尤须经过群众路线，认真组织劳动互助。首先是使战争勤务与生产有很好的分工互助，一部分人出去参战，一部分人在家生产，轮流交替，互相变工。在家的人帮助出去的人种地。对敌占区逃来群众，可能回去的即组织回去春耕，不能回去的则就地安置，调剂公地或和人伙种等办法，使之春耕或作其他副业生产。敌人所过地区破坏最大，有的粮食被抢光，政府必须切实设法，发放贷款、贷粮，加强合作社工作，切实帮助群众解决春耕中的困难。对此应以最大责任心与努力，以紧紧团结全体人民坚持抗敌。
    （五）所有机关、学校、部队每行一地，应即抽出人力畜力帮助群众抢种。给群众带头。推动群众生产积极性。（到前线服务的人民如担架队等，亦可利用空闲帮助战区群众生产。）地方机关、学校、部队尤应以最大力量进行生产，并争取自给。坚持今年的自给生产，比已往任何一年都要重要。只要能够做到自给，我们就会战胜敌人，立于不败之地。
    以上各部队、各级党应即作深刻讨论、布置。各分区、各县领导机关并须有专人负责此项工作的领导，并随时检查督促，以求贯彻。
                                            西北局四月二十八日
