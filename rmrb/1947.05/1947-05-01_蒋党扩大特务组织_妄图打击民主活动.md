　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th: According to the Shanghai News on March 6th, Chiang Kai-shek has concentrated his most elite secret agents and thugs in major cities such as Shanghai, Beiping, and Chongqing, preparing for a major crackdown. Their method is to "strike the lower levels first, then the upper levels; strike the cadres first, then the celebrities; befriend the distant and attack the near, divide and conquer." The specific "five-step plan" announced by the Chiang Gang's secret service chief at a cadre meeting in Shanghai is as follows: First, attack the leading core of patriotic democratic activities; second, attack the propaganda organs of patriotic democratic activities—newspapers and magazines; third, attack the strongest force in democratic activities—students and workers; fourth, attack democratic activities among vocational youths; fifth, attack domestic and international democratic and patriotic leaders with prestige.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th: Beiping dispatch: The Kuomintang authorities in Beiping City have recently established more than 800 secret service organizations specifically to arrest so-called "suspects" and "unstable elements." The number of people arrested has reached 6,000. Beiping City is under temporary curfew several times a day, and military police and secret agents conduct searches. Many military police take this opportunity to extort and blackmail citizens.

　　蒋党扩大特务组织  妄图打击民主活动
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】据三月六日沪报透露：蒋介石已将其全国最精萃的特务、打手，集中分布于上海、北平、重庆等各大城市，准备大打。其作法是“先打下层，后打上层；先打干部，后打名流；远交近攻，分而治之。”蒋党特务头子在上海干部会议上所宣布具体的“五部曲”为：第一，打击爱国民主活动的领导核心；第二，打击爱国民主活动的舆论机关——报纸、杂志；第三，打击民主活动最强的队伍——学生、工人；第四，打击职业青年间的民主活动；第五，打击国际国内有威望的民主爱国领袖。
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】北平讯：平市国民党当局近成立八百多个专抓所谓“嫌疑分子”“不稳分子”的特务组织，被捕人数前后已达六千人。平市每天临时戒严数次，军警特务即行搜索，许多军警更借此机会向市民勒索敲诈。
