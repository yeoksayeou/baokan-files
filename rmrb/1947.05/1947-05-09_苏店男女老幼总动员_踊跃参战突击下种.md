【Benbao Changzhi News】The whole village of Sudian in the Second District, with 664 households, has a total of 6,882 mu of dry land and 310 mu of garden land. One mu of garden land is equivalent to 12 mu of farmland in terms of labor, totaling over 10,000 mu of land. Excluding soldiers, migrant workers, and the first batch of 60 participants in the battle, the village currently has 419 male laborers (including merchants, saltpeter workers, cadres, and patients). Each person has an average of 25 mu of land to cultivate. Cadres and the masses felt they lacked confidence, with some saying, "Cultivating two and leaving one idle, I'm afraid we'll cultivate two mu and leave one mu barren." After rectifying mutual aid and implementing precise calculations, the confidence of each group increased, and they successively formulated sowing plans. On the 29th of last month, the second batch of participants in the battle was organized. When the cadres heard that Sudian was sending 120 people, everyone worried again. Zhang Baize said, "It's time to sow, and now we really have no way." The cadres lacked confidence again. After mobilization, they realized that without victory on the front lines, there would be no production in the rear, and in order to eradicate the old roots, they were determined to complete the task of participating in the battle. At the same time, everyone was inspired by recalling the situation of organizing auxiliary labor last autumn to rush the autumn harvest and autumn plowing. The example of Xiguxian in this district organizing 80 women to overcome labor difficulties was introduced, and everyone understood that as long as they are well organized, participation in the battle and production will not be delayed. That night, the cadres of each street led the masses to discuss: How will the families of those participating in the battle live? An old man said, "The front line is important, let those who can go go. Now the land is almost ready, only short of sowing. The old folks and women will lend a hand, and we can guarantee the sowing." Some said, "Participating in the battle is everyone's business, who can only take care of themselves?" At the same time, the problem of mutual labor exchange between the front and rear was resolved. All 120 participants in the battle volunteered to sign up. Wei Xiaohai, the street chief of North Street, was 42 years old and had a foot problem, but he was also determined to go. "Shen Huoze" from South Street, who was mischievous and pretended to be sick and unwilling to go, was told by the 70-year-old man Su Maozhi, "What are you pretending to be sick for? Think about it, if you don't defeat Chiang Kai-shek, no matter how much you produce, can you keep it?" This one sentence convinced Huoze. The production problems after the departure of the participants were all solved by finding mutual aid and replacement cultivation partners, discussing face-to-face what work should be done and how to do it. Liu Fa said, "I currently have seven mu of corn to sow, the land is also ready, and there are two women at home, who can also plant seeds and collect manure." Group leader Cui Baisuo said, "No problem, we will sow tomorrow, don't worry." Each group also adjusted mutually according to the labor situation. The Quancheng group, with 13 households, only sent three people and voluntarily cultivated land for four households from other groups. Because the participants were leaving only on the third day, everyone proposed: While they are at home, let's rush to plant corn for the participants and plant for the families of the soldiers first, then plant for ourselves, no one can only take care of themselves. With such high enthusiasm, the next morning, the whole village mobilized to rush to sow. According to statistics from 31 groups (out of 38 groups in the village), in one day, 56 livestock, 164 male laborers, 62 female laborers, and 67 children participated, planting 344.5 mu of corn and 30 mu of millet for 74 families of participants in the battle, plowing 152.1 mu of land, delivering fertilizer to 182 mu, reclaiming 82 mu of wasteland, and irrigating 17 mu of garden land. Due to the unified exchange labor and repayment labor methods stipulated by the whole village, the enthusiasm for replacement cultivation was greatly enhanced. For example, Cui Quancheng group, with eleven men, six women, and two yokes of livestock, planted 34 mu of corn, reclaimed 10 mu of wasteland and fertilized 10 mu of land, and harrowed 10 mu of land for Cui Muming and other five households in one day. Bi Eryun group, with six women, ground 120 jin of soybean cake for Du Qingshan in one afternoon. Xu Sannv group planted 16 mu of millet and 6 mu of corn for three households in one day. Through this day of rushing exchange labor, the masses further experienced that organization is strength, and that participation in the battle and production can both be achieved, and that it is not empty talk, which boosted their confidence in participating in the battle and production. Shen Quangui said, "I am going to transport grain this time. The land at home has also been plowed, and the corn has been sown. Don't say eight days, even if I don't come back for half a month or twenty days, I will be very relieved." Now each group has re-formulated a sowing plan: the corn land in the whole village will be sown by May 15th at the latest, and the millet land will be sown by the 10th. Everyone said, "Although it is a rush, we can't just seek speed without quality, we still have to plow deeply and work carefully."

　　苏店男女老幼总动员
    踊跃参战突击下种
    【本报长治讯】二区苏店，全村六百六十四户，共旱地六千八百八十二亩，园地三百一十亩。一亩园地顶十二亩田费工，共折田一万余亩，除参军外出工人和第一批参战六十人外，全村现有男劳力四百一十九个（包括商人、硝房工人、干部、病人），每人平均种地二十五亩，干部群众都感到没信心，有的说：“耕二余一哩，恐怕是耕二亩荒一亩。”经整顿互助实行精确计算后，各组信心提高，纷纷订出下种计划。上月二十九日，组织第二批参战，干部一听说苏店是一百二十个人，大家又发了愁，张白则说：“正该下种哩，这下可真没有办法。”干部又没信心了，后经动员，认识了没有前线胜利，也没有后方生产，为刨掉老根，坚决完成参战任务。同时又启发大家回忆去秋组织辅助劳力，突击秋收、秋耕的情况，介绍了本区西故县组织起八十个妇女克服了劳力困难的实例，大家明确了只要很好的组织起来，参战、生产都误不了。当晚各干部即分街领导群众讨论：参战人走了，家里生活怎样办？一个老汉说：“前方要紧，能挑的人都去吧，现在地收拾差不多了，只短下籽，老汉、妇女下了手，保险能下种。”有的说：“参战是大家的事，谁能光顾自个。”同时，结合解决了前后方变工问题，一百二十个参战人员都系自愿报名。北街街长魏小孩，四十二岁，脚上有病，也坚决要去。南街“申活则”，挑皮捣蛋，装病不愿去，七十老汉苏毛只说：“你装病干啥，你想想不打败蒋介石，你就生产下多少东西，能保得住吗？”这一下把话则说通了。参战人走后的生产问题，都是以互助自找代耕对象，当面商讨该做什么活，怎样做。刘发则说：“我当下有七亩玉茭，需要下种，地也便当啦，家里两个婆娘，还能点籽抓粪。”组长崔柏锁说：“不成问题，明天就种，你放心吧。”各组又按劳力情况，互相调剂。全成组十三户，只走了三个人，又自动给外组四户代耕。因为参战人是第三天才走，大家提出：趁他们在家，咱们先给参战人突击种玉茭，给参战军属种完了，再给自己种，谁也不能光管自己。在这样高度热情下，第二天一早，全村总动员，突击下种。据三十一个组（全村三十八个组）统计，一天内，参加牲口五十六个，男劳力一百六十四个，女劳力六十二个，儿童六十七个，给七十四家参战人种玉茭三百四十四亩五分，种谷三十亩，犁地一百五十二亩一分，送肥一百八十二亩，翻荒八十二亩，浇园地十七亩。由于全村规定了统一变工、还工办法，大大发挥了代耕积极性。如崔全成组十一个男人、六个妇女、两犋牲口，给崔木明等五户一天种玉茭三十四亩，翻荒肥十亩地、垡茬十亩，耙地十亩。毕二云组六个妇女，一下午给杜青山碾豆饼一百廿斤。徐三女组，给三户一天种谷十六亩、玉茭六亩。经这一天突击变工，群众更体验了组织起来有力量，参战生产两不误，不是空话，鼓舞了参战与生产的信心。申全贵说：“我这次去运粮。家里地也犁了，玉茭也种下，不用说八天，就半月二十天不回来，也很放心。”现各组重新订出下种计划：全村玉茭地最迟在五月十五日前种完，谷地在十日前种完。大家都说：“虽是突击，可不能图快不图好，还得深翻细作哩。”
