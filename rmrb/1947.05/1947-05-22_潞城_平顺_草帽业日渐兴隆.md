　　Lucheng & Pingshun: Straw Hat Industry Thriving
    [This newspaper, Taihang, 20th] The straw hat industry, one of the main sideline occupations of the people in Lucheng and Pingshun counties, is flourishing. According to statistics from Lucheng for three months, from November last year to January this year: The masses of the entire county earned more than 14,714,000 yuan in silver dollars from weaving straw hats, which is enough for the entire county's daily coal, oil, salt, and pocket money. In order to support the masses in mass production, the county cooperative allocated 10 million yuan, and the masses also raised 5 million yuan to open factories. The county's straw hat industry was known as developed before the war, with 140 straw hat weaving machines, all of which were destroyed by the Japanese invaders. After liberation, with the vigorous support of our government, more than 50 machines have now resumed work. Rural women who cut straw hat braids have also rapidly recovered. The four stations set up by the county cooperative alone purchased more than 20,000 catties of straw hat braids in three months, worth more than 7,250,000 yuan in silver dollars. The amount of free transactions among the people and purchases by village cooperatives is even greater. The scale of straw hat factories in various village cooperatives is also expanding day by day. For example, the Jin Village factory previously had only more than 100,000 yuan in capital, but now it has grown to 1.8 million yuan and has six machines, producing hundreds of straw hats a day. In Pingshun Beishe Village, from February 4th to the end of April, the 431 women of the entire village cut 10,743 braids of straw hats (20 circles per braid) and sewed 4,714 straw hats during the 100-day textile sprint. Calculated at an average sale of 200 yuan per braid and an average sale of 400 yuan per straw hat, a total of more than 3,982,200 yuan in silver dollars can be earned. After summing up their experience, the women in the area are in high spirits and plan to complete the same number of braids and hats as in the previous three months in the next three months.

    【本报太行二十日电】潞城、平顺两县民间主要副业之一的草帽业，日渐兴盛。据潞城去年十一月到今年一月三个月统计：全县群众切草帽办共赚洋一千四百七十一万四千余元，足够全县群众日常烧煤、油盐及零花之用。县联社为扶持群众大量生产，曾拨资金一千万元，群众也集资五百万元开设工厂。该县草帽业战前即称发达，编草帽机有一百四十架，被日寇全部摧毁。解放后在我政府大力扶助下，现已有五十余架复工。农村妇女切草帽辫者也迅速恢复。仅县联社设立之四个站，三个月内收买之草帽辫开达二万余斤，值洋七百廿五万余元，民间自由交易与村合作社收买者数量更大。各村合作社之草帽工厂，规模也日渐扩大，如靳村工厂过去只有资金十余万元，现已发展至一百八十万，并拥有机子六架，日产草帽数百顶。平顺北社村妇女从二月初四至四月底三个月中，全村四百三十一人，在突击百日纺织中，抽工夫切草帽辫一万零七百四十三把，每把二十圈），缀草帽四千七百一十四顶。每把平均卖二百元，每顶草帽平均卖四百元计，共可赚洋三百九十八万二千二百余元。该地妇女经过总结后情绪很高，并计划在今后三个月内仍要完成前三月所切辫数及帽数。
