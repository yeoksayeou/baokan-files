[This article transmitted by] Our Newspaper Taiyue, 19th. After a small rain of two and a half finger-widths in Gaoping Houzhuang, the masses quickly launched a rush-planting campaign. Forty-two women, including Kong Xiao'e, actively participated in mutual aid, pulling seed drills and treading seeds with great enthusiasm. Gui Fa's wife, despite having bound feet, refused to be left behind. She put on men's shoes and walked forward on her toes, picking up the large shoes. Within three days, they rushed to plant 2,104 mu of millet, 104 mu of sesame, and 74 mu of sorghum. The cotton and hemp seedlings, having been watered and planted individually, had already sprouted completely and were a lovely green.

[This article transmitted by] Our Newspaper Taiyue, 19th. Jiangli Village in Yangcheng reorganized its mutual aid efforts, with all villagers, men and women, mobilizing to rush-plant. After the rain on May 1st, village cadres, in coordination with the mutual aid brigades, convened a mass meeting to mobilize rush planting. At the meeting, it was unanimously decided that all women would stop spinning and go to the fields to work, and coal mine workers and primary school students would suspend work and classes for three days to participate in agricultural production. The organizational form of the past was changed, with large groups divided into small groups, and people concentrated or dispersed at any time according to the work, without wasting manpower or time. First, the land of military personnel, cadres, martyrs' families, and civilian laborers participating in the war was cultivated, and then their own land was cultivated. Starting from the 3rd, all 753 men and women, full and semi-able-bodied laborers, and 139 head of livestock in the 43 mutual aid groups in the three natural villages belonging to the village poured into the fields. Men and women, old and young, in each group had a precise division of labor, with men shaking the seed drills, women leading the livestock, and children treading the seeds. Some women in the Nanjigou group were also able to operate the seed drills and plant seeds, so they finished the earliest and helped the Wangping and other groups with ten head of livestock. Military families and families of civilian laborers participating in the war also competed to work. Yang Xiaoding, a military family member, not only did not receive preferential treatment but also went to give preferential treatment to the families of martyrs. Yuan Xihe went to participate in the war, and his wife volunteered to help each other, planting all of their land, which influenced other women to compete with each other. All the children in the village, in addition to treading the millet, also cooperated with the Sanmin High School students to weed 940 mu of wheat land belonging to military personnel, cadres, martyrs' families, and civilian laborers participating in the war in three days. By the 8th, all 3,509 mu of land in the village had been planted. Now, millet seedlings are emerging everywhere, especially the crops of military families and civilian laborers participating in the war are the best. The masses are all happily writing letters to comfort the front-line soldiers and sent representatives with over ninety letters of sympathy and 6,000 yuan in consolation money to the front to express their sympathy, telling them, "The crops have already been planted well." Encouraged by the whole village, the participating farmers also wrote back saying, "The rear's production is up to you, and we will definitely complete the front's tasks."
