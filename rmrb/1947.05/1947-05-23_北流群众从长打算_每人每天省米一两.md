　　Beiliu Masses Plan for the Long Term
    Each Person Saves an Ounce of Rice a Day
    [This newspaper, Licheng News] The masses in Beiliu Village have voluntarily created a plan to save for famine relief. Previously, because they had just been emancipated and their lives had improved, they ate noodles twice a day. Now, they have changed to eating noodles only one day out of three. General households mostly mix cornmeal, eating noodles only one day out of three. When cooking, they carefully avoid leftovers, and rice porridge is made thinner, striving to save one ounce of millet per person per day. At the same time, they are rushing to plant more mu of land, planting as much as possible, striving to leave no land uncultivated.
    [This newspaper, Shexian News] Twenty-five emancipated peasants in Shiyao Village, Second District, discussed on the 14th, "What should we do if it doesn't rain?" Some said: "We have planted more than fifty mu of cotton, and it still hasn't rained. We can't wait, let's carry water to plant yams, pumpkins, and corn! Each person should lead everyone in their group to work together and fight against the drought." Hao Xiangde said: "Just carrying water to plant is not enough, we must save millet, find some wild vegetables to eat with it. I used to eat 1.2 sheng of rice every day, but from now on I will eat 0.7 sheng, saving 0.5 sheng every day." Old man Feng Shuquan said: "Let's go back and hold a family meeting and all save a little." Now the whole village is carrying water to plant cotton, yams, pumpkins, and corn, and practicing thrift. Shi Yupan, an old man in his sixties in Nan Jie, Suobao, is leading his group in drought prevention. He said: "We can't just wait if it doesn't rain, we can only save ourselves by fighting against the drought." He has led his group of ten households to plant five mu of cotton. He said: "We must save, little by little, don't eat all the rice and then buy more." Everyone talked about the pain of famine years, saying: "If we don't save at the beginning, later we will only eat wild vegetables, our stomachs will be uncomfortable and our heads will be dizzy, let's save early."

    【本报黎城讯】北流村群众自动订出计划节约备荒，以前因刚翻身，生活改善，一天吃两顿面，现均改成三天一顿，一般户则多掺玉茭面三天一顿面。在做饭上要斟酌不留剩饭，米饭要稀点，争取每人每天节约小米一两。同时趁垧赶种，多种一棵是一棵，争取不荒地。
    【本报涉县讯】二区石窑村翻身农民二十五人于十四日讨论天不下雨怎办？有的说：“咱们栽了五十余亩花，现在还不下雨，咱们不能等，担水栽山药、南瓜、玉茭吧！各人到自己组内领导大家都干，给旱天作斗争”。郝香德说：“光担水下种还不够，咱们要节省小米，弄些野菜配上吃，我过去每天得一升二合米，以后要吃七合米，每天省五合”。冯树全老汉说：“咱们回去开个家庭会，都省减些”。现全村正在担水栽花、山药、、南瓜、玉茭，并实行节约。索堡南街石玉盘六十多岁的老汉领导全组防旱，他说：“天不下雨咱不能光等，给旱天作斗争才能救自己”。他领导全组十户已栽了五亩花。他说：“咱们要节省，细水长流，不要吃完了再买米”。大家谈到荒年的痛苦说：“开始不节省，后来光吃野菜，肚子难受头也闷，咱们早些省吧”。
