　　The Yangcheng慰劳团 (comfort group), consisting of 25 members, arrived at the Jinan front lines on the 6th. They brought 3,000 letters and comfort letters from home and countless慰劳品 (gifts of comfort) to the frontline warriors. In the 30 letters, there was only one thought in thousands of words: "Defeat Chiang Kai-shek's offensive as soon as possible." When the comfort group passed through a certain place on the 30th, they first went to the hospital for the sick and wounded to console the wounded warriors. It was raining heavily, and the comfort group braved the rain to go, deeply moving the sick and wounded soldiers. A wounded comrade from a certain battalion who was injured in the Quwo battle quickly came out to greet them, and tightly grasped the hand of the old man Wang Yuan (Yangcheng Councilor), and said excitedly: "You sent us off to the front lines, your stretcher team carried us off the fire line after we were injured, and now you are here to comfort us." When entering the ward, all the wounded soldiers forgot their pain. Those who could struggle to get up struggled to get up, and those who could not move also asked people to turn their necks to give a smile. When the comfort group was about to leave, the wounded soldiers all told them to tell their families: "The injury will heal quickly, and we will definitely kill a few more enemies for you." The comfort group has now gone to various units on the front line to offer comfort. (Attached image)

　　阳城慰劳团抵前线
    冒雨慰问伤员
    【本报太岳前线十二日电】阳城慰劳团一行二十五人已于六日抵达晋南前线。他们给前线勇士带来了三千封家信慰问信和无数慰劳品。在三十封书信上，千言万语只有一个心思，——“早日打垮蒋介石的进攻”。当慰劳团三十日经过某地时，曾先到伤病医院慰问负伤勇士。时值大雨淋漓，慰问团冒雨前往，伤病员深为感动。曲沃战斗中负伤的某营伤员同志赶快出来迎接他们，紧紧握住王源（阳城参议员）老汉的手，激动的说：“上前线你们送我们走，挂彩了你们的担架队又把我们从火线上抬下来，现在你们又来慰问。”进病房时所有伤员均忘记了自己的痛苦，能挣扎起来的挣扎起来，不能动的也叫人扭转脖子来报以微笑。慰问团临走时，伤员们都叮嘱转告家里人说：“伤很快就好了，一定为你们多杀几个敌人。”现慰问团已分赴前线各部队慰问。（附图片）
