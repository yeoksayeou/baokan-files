　　Half-Month War Situation in This Region
    New War Brewing in Northern Henan, Our Army Tightens Encirclement of Anyang, Taiyuan and Linfen Become Isolated Islands, Hu and Yan's Troops Panic-Stricken
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] The Military Region Headquarters recently released the "Half-Month War Situation in This Region" from the 1st to the 15th of this month, the original text is as follows:
    On the first day of May, our army in northern Henan, after eight hours of fierce fighting, liberated Tangyin County. Over 9,000 troops of Sun Dianying's Department, originally the Sixth Route Army of the puppet regime, which Chiang Kai-shek had additionally appointed as the Provisional Third Column, were annihilated. Thus, after our army cut off the Ping-Han Railway at the end of March, another of the two strongholds remaining north of the Wei River was eliminated by our army (the other being Anyang). The enemy's dream of controlling key points and holding cities with heavy troops has been shattered; it proves that the People's Liberation Army is not only good at field battles, but also at attacking fortified positions. In the face of the People's Liberation Army, the enemy has no other way to go except surrender and annihilation. Afterwards, our army captured Cuijiaqiao, annihilated the bandit Wang Ziquan's troops, gradually cleared the outer strongholds of Anyang, tightened the encirclement, and controlled most of the southern pass. The battle to capture the city is raging fiercely in the suburbs. In order to save its declining fate in northern Henan, the enemy on the one hand reoccupied Fengqiu, Yanjin, and Yangwu with the entire 41st Division, consolidating its flank; on the other hand, it urgently drew the 185th Brigade of the 66th Division near Wuhan, and the 64th Brigade of the 15th Division in eastern Henan, and rushed them to Jixian. Wang Zhonglian personally led the entire 32nd Division, the 3rd Division, and one regiment each from the 28th Division, advancing from Xinxiang to Jixian, remotely providing support in an attempt to relieve the siege of Anyang. A new war is brewing.
    In the Jinzhong and Jinnan areas, our army recovered the Yuncheng Airport and Pinglu County on the southern front. On the northern front, in coordination with the Jin-Cha-Ji troops, we cleared the enemy from Yangquan to the Dongzhao Railway Station (east of Yuci), and again controlled more than 150 li of the Zhengtai Railway line, and Taiyuan has become an isolated island. Hu and Yan's troops are panic-stricken. Yan Xishan gathered the remnants he could muster (with designations of ten brigades and two corps, but not a single brigade was not in a state of disrepair), crowding the suburbs of Taiyuan and Yuci in an attempt to hold firm. Hu Zongnan, in addition to concentrating the entire 30th Division in Linfen, also flew to Linfen on the 6th. Bai Chongxi also flew to Taiyuan at the same time, to cheer up the turtles trapped in jars in Taiyuan and Linfen. In any case, the People's Liberation Army will inevitably give them new blows.
    In addition, our powerful guerrilla corps, active in the Yu-Wan-Su and Ji-Lu-Yu regions, successively attacked and entered the four cities of Wenshang, Yanjin, Fugou, and Xihua, as well as the eastern pass of Xiayi, twice recovered Feicheng, and freely entered and exited both sides of the old and new Yellow Rivers, powerfully coordinating with the operations on the main front.

　　本区半月战况
    豫北酝酿新战事我军紧缩安阳包围太原临汾已成孤岛胡阎军惊恐万状
    【本报讯】军区司令部顷发表本月一日至十五日“本区半月战况”，原文如下：
    五月的第一天，豫北我军以八小时激烈战斗，解放汤阴县城。歼灭由蒋介石加委为暂编第三纵队的原伪第六方面军孙殿英部九千余人。至此，三月末我军切断平汉路后，残存在卫河以北的两个据点，又为我军打掉一个（另一个为安阳）。粉碎了蒋军以重兵控制要点、固守城池的幻梦；证明着人民解放军不但善于野战，而且善于攻坚，在人民解放军面前，蒋军除了投降与覆灭之外，再无别路可走。此后，我军即攻克崔家桥，歼灭王自全匪部，渐次肃清安阳外围据点，紧缩包围圈，控制南关大部。攻城战正在城郊激烈进行中。蒋军为挽救其在豫北的没落命运，乃一方面以整四十一师再占封邱、延津、阳武，巩固其侧翼阵地；一方面急抽调在武汉附近之整六十六师一八五旅，在豫东之整十五师六四旅，赶运汲县。并由王仲廉亲率整三十二师全部、整三师、整二十八师各一个团，由新乡进至汲县，遥为声援，企图解安阳之围。新的战事正酝酿中。
    晋中、晋南方面，我军在南线收复运城机场及平陆县城。在北线配合晋察冀部队，肃清阳泉至东赵车站（榆次以东）之敌，再控制正太线一百五十余里，太原已成为一座孤岛。胡阎两军惊恐万状，于是阎锡山乃调集其所能抽调的残兵败将（番号倒有十个旅、两个总队，但没有一个旅不是残破不堪的），麇集太原、榆次近郊以图固守。胡宗南则除以三十师全部集结临汾外，并于六日飞临汾。白崇禧亦同时飞太原，给困守太原、临汾两地的瓮中之鳖打气。不管怎样，人民解放军必然仍将予他们以新的打击。
    此外，我活跃在豫皖苏及冀鲁豫的强大游击兵团，先后攻入汶上、延津、扶沟、西华四城及夏邑东关，两次收复肥城，从容进出于新旧黄河两岸，有力地配合着正面战场作战。
