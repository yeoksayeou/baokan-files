　　Continue to Develop the Merit Campaign
  　64th Unit Celebrates Heroes
    [By Our Correspondent] To further promote the merit campaign, the 64th Unit held a merit citation meeting for the entire unit on the 7th. The day before the meeting, the propaganda and education sections of each regiment were busy preparing for the celebration, collecting deeds of the heroes, filling out commendation forms, and the propaganda team, including comrades Liu Xiang, wrote eight large slogans on an old courtyard wall in one go. Comrade Fan Yun of the People's Pictorial Press painted a huge picture for the venue, turning a ruined courtyard into a brand-new meeting place. On the morning of the 7th, the military band accompanied 324 heroes into the venue. The leaders spoke, calling on everyone to learn from Comrade Wang Ruhan, the company commander who calmly responded in emergency situations, and Comrade Ren Shangxiang, who improved his military skills and fought bravely. The column leaders called for adding more merits on top of previous merits. The Taihang Comfort Group also rushed to participate, bringing two large carts of慰劳品(comfort items). Political Commissar Liu explained to everyone the incorrect understanding of some comrades regarding the merit campaign, such as thinking that it is easy to gain merit in wartime, but not in peacetime; it is easy to gain merit during marching, but not during garrisoning; it is easy for soldiers to gain merit, but not for cadres; it is easy for companies to gain merit, but not for organs. All these ideas should be corrected. Subsequently, Director Yao read out the Party Committee's decision on learning from the heroes and continuing to develop the merit campaign. In the evening, the Ci County Liming Troupe performed programs such as Victory Army and Tears of Blood to add to the fun. (Zhang Sheng)

　　继续开展立功运动
  　六四部队庆贺功臣
    【本报讯】六四部队为继续推进立功运动，特于七号召开全部队功臣大会。开会的前一天，各团宣教股忙碌准备庆贺，搜制功臣事迹，填发报功单，宣传队刘祥等同志在一个旧的院墙上，一气写了八条大标语。人民画报社范云同志为会场画了一幅巨画，把一片废墟的院落变成焕然一新的会场。七号早晨，军乐队伴随着三百二十四名功臣进入会场，首长讲话，号召大家学习在紧急情况下沉着应战的连长王如汉同志，提高军事技术勇敢作战的任尚祥同志等功臣的业迹。纵队首长号召要功上加功。会中太行慰问团，带着两大车慰劳品，亦赶来参加。刘政委向大家解释某些同志对立功运动的不正确认识，如认为战时好立功，平时不好立功，行军好立功，驻军不好立功，战士好立功，干部不好立功，连队好立功，机关不好立功等思想，都应纠正。继由姚主任宣读了党委会关于向功臣学习继续开展立功运动的决定。晚由磁县黎明剧团演胜利军、血泊之泪等节目助兴。（张升）
