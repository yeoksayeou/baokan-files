　　“Comrade: Let us go to the front to carry the wounded brothers! We are not afraid, we will surely complete the task…” This was the second request from Han, the stretcher team leader. The responsible comrade of a certain regiment of the Taishan Unit patiently and kindly explained, “Fellow villagers, you have been too tired from wading through the river last night. Stay back a bit today. Look at how old you are, take a rest, don't be anxious!” Han Fujin, who was forty-one years old, was persuaded again, and the five people had no choice but to wait anxiously.

They were stretcher bearers from Taocheng, Second District of She County, and they had been supporting the front lines for several days. They had already rescued a wounded soldier from the front line once. The clothes of each person were torn, revealing patches of white, as they successfully crossed the knee-deep small river and the difficult-to-pass thorns, smoothly carrying the wounded soldier back the same way.

On the western mountain fort, there was a constant "pat, pat" sound, which was the sound of the battalion commander's gunfire covering the stretcher bearers. All the stretcher teams had returned, except for Han Fujin's. Just then, they saw a wounded comrade by the small river over there. The task came, and the four people advanced with their backs bent.

Passing through an open space, they reached the wounded soldier lying by the river, only seven or eight meters away from the enemy. They calmly, skillfully, and quickly lifted him up. The fire was still burning on the wounded soldier's sleeve. They pinched at it as they walked, forgetting the burning and pain. "Bang!" A shot hit beside the four of them, but they still calmly grabbed the wounded soldier and ran, thus passing through the critical moment, leaving the enemy seventy or eighty steps behind. The enemy did not give up their shooting at them, even harboring the ambition to capture them. The machine gun roared again. A bullet hit Zhou Shuide's leg, and he fell. Then, Qi Jiexin, who was twenty years old, was also injured.

“Those who can walk, hurry up and leave! Two people must also carry the brother back.” Han Fujin said to the two injured stretcher bearers.

“You two go! We'll carry…” Before Zhou Youjin could finish his words, two bullets pierced his right shoulder, and blood flowed out through his cotton-padded clothes.

“You all go! Quickly, I will carry the brother on my back!” Old Han said as he began to carry him on his back. At this moment, an enemy bullet passed through his foot, and he could no longer walk, only waiting for someone to come and go back with the wounded comrade.

The retreating troops from the west mountain approached. One said to him, “Fellow villager, you are also injured. Someone will carry him behind, I will carry you, let's go quickly!”

“I'm fine, you carry this comrade!” As he spoke, two comrades had already carried the stretcher away. “I… you just help me, and I'll be fine.” After saying that, he勉强 stood up.

The troops gradually moved. Old Han said with great concern, “Comrade! You quickly chase the troops! It's not far now, I'll go by myself!”

“It doesn't matter, I must find a way to send you to a place with a stretcher before I can feel relieved…”

Old Han was already lying safely on the stretcher. This soldier even sent him more than half a kilometer away.

　　一付担架在火线上
    曹占芳
    “同志：让我们到前边抬弟兄吧！我们不怕，保险完成任务……。”这是担架队的韩班长的第二次请求了。泰山部某团的负责同志，仍是耐心和气地解释道：“老乡：你们昨天晚上淌河太辛苦了，今天在后边一些，看你这么大年纪啦，休息休息，别急吗！”四十一岁的韩富金又被劝住了，五个人只好焦急地等着。
    他们是涉县二区桃城的担架，从家出来支援前线已好几天了，他们已经从火线上抢救过一次彩号，每个人的衣服擦破出几朵白花，胜利地穿过了膝盖深的小河和难以通行的荆辣，顺利地把彩号从原路上抬回来了。
    西边的山堡上，不断地拍、拍、的响着，这是营长掩护抬彩号的枪声。担架队的各班都抬回去了，只剩下韩富金的这一付。正在这时他们看见那边小河边有一个负了伤的同志，任务来了，四个人弯着腰前进着。
    通过一块开阔地，到了躺在河边的彩号跟前，离敌人只七八米。他们沉着熟练迅速地抬上。火仍在伤员的袖上燃烧着，他们边走边捏，忘记了烧和痛，“砰”的一枪，打在四人的身旁，但他们仍沉着的抢起彩号就跑，就这样通过了紧要的关头，把敌人掉在七八十步的后面。敌人仍未放弃对他们的射击，甚至俘虏他们的野心。机关枪又狂叫起来了，有一枪打在周水德的腿上，他躺下了，接着二十岁的齐姐心也挂彩了。
    “能走的都赶快走吧！两个人也要把弟兄抬回去”。韩富金向挂彩的两个担架员说。
    “你俩走吧！我俩来抬……”周有金的话还没有说完，两颗子弹钻进了他的右肩上，血隔着棉衣流了出来。
    “你们都走吧！快一点，我来把弟兄背上吧！”老韩一边说就一边背起来了，这时敌人的子弹，从他的脚上穿过了，已经不能行走，只等着有人来，好和负伤的同志一块回去。
    西山撤退下来的队伍来近了，一个对他说：“老乡，你也挂彩了。后面有人抬他，我背上你快些走吧！”
    “我不要紧，你背上这个同志吧！”说着已有两个同志把担架抬走了。“我……你扶着我就行了。”说罢他勉强地站了起来。
    队伍渐渐转移了，老韩很关心地说：“同志！你赶快追队伍吧！这不远了，我自己去吧！”
    “不要紧，我无论如何也得想办法把你送到有担架的地方才能放心……”。
    老韩已经安安稳稳躺在担架上了。这个战士还送他一里多地以外。
