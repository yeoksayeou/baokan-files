　　Jinnan's Emancipated Peasants Tensely Irrigate and Sow Seeds
    [This Dispatch from Jinnan, May 2nd] Having obtained land, the Jinnan peasants are working hard to prosper and are tensely engaged in spring plowing. In Longping County, Districts 1, 2, and 5 opened the sluice gates of the Fuyang River to ensure timely sowing of autumn crops. The Douzhuang sluice gate alone can irrigate five qing of land daily, and 200 qing have already been irrigated. Other sluice gates can irrigate two qing of land daily. Six-tenths of the land in the three districts has been irrigated. Qiu County's Nanliuyuan Village, led by labor hero, is guiding the masses to shift from sideline production to agricultural production. They extracted a portion of the profits earned from sideline occupations to buy eleven head of cattle and many farm tools. Eighty-five percent of the full and semi-labor force of the whole village has been organized, totaling thirteen groups with ninety-seven people, and they are now rushing to sow seeds. In order to complete the production plan of increasing output by 290,000 jin, Li Shengzhuang launched a manure accumulation campaign. Under the leadership of labor hero Li Zhaoan and Farmers' Association Director Li Zhiguang, twenty-five people have already shouldered manure baskets, and even Li Runsheng, who used to not labor, is now picking up manure daily. Currently, every household in the two villages has a manure pit and is raising eighty-eight piglets. The villagers guarantee that they will accumulate 777 large cartloads of fertilizer from April until after the wheat harvest. In Dagahuantou, Guan County, every household is working hard in spring plowing, seizing the time to hoe the wheat. Nineteen primary school students also formed four mutual aid groups, hoeing wheat every afternoon. In five days, they hoed seventy mu, and currently two-fifths of the village's wheat fields have been hoed.
