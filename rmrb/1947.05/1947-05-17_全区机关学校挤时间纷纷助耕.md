All District Government Offices and Schools
Squeeze in Time to Help with Farming
[This newspaper reports] Government offices, schools, and troops have all achieved results in assisting with farming. Peking University responded to President Fan's call and launched a fervent campaign to assist with farming. From the 17th of last month to the end of the month, they plowed 1,688 mu of land for military families, dependents of revolutionary martyrs, and the widowed and orphaned, transported 75 cartloads of fertilizer, and carried 100 loads of manure. Secretary-General Luo personally took the lead, going to the fields every morning and returning only when it was time for meals, earning unanimous praise from the masses and teachers and students. Students of Taihang No. 1 Middle School helped military families in the garrison area transport 283 loads of manure in two days. All officers and soldiers of the Democratic National Construction Army vigorously assisted the villages where they were stationed with spring plowing. According to statistics from five villages, they contributed 8,130 labor days and 60 animal labor days in fifteen days, greatly alleviating the labor shortage in the villages. All comrades of the General Headquarters and the Second Army helped the masses pull plows and carts to deliver manure, often working shirtless. All teachers and students of the Border Region Jianye Accounting School helped the military families in the villages where they were stationed with plowing and sowing. In two weeks, they delivered as many as 879 loads of manure to the military families during their spare time, delivering all the manure to the fields for 17 military families, and plan to deliver all the manure to the fields for 69 military families in the shortest possible time. The Military Region Finance School launched a spring plowing campaign on the 29th of last month, taking advantage of breaks in their studies. In five days, they carried a total of 121 loads of manure, plowed 26 mu of land, weeded 7.6 mu of wheat, watered 2.9 mu of gardens, and built 46 dams.

[This newspaper reports] While the soldiers on the front lines bravely kill the enemy, the masses in various parts of Southern Hebei give priority to helping the families of revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, and workers with plowing and sowing. All the masses in Wuxun Houjia Village in Southern Hebei mobilized together and completed the plowing and sowing of all the land for the 13 families of revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, and workers in the entire village in two and a half days. Dongshannan Village in Yaoshan held group meetings to discuss and solve the difficulties of spring plowing for families of revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, and workers, and decided to establish fixed, temporary, and flexible forms of assistance organizations. All families of revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, and workers who completely lack labor and livestock should be provided with fixed assistance, with the assistance group guaranteeing their farming throughout the year. If the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel have some labor and livestock but have other difficulties that cannot be solved, the temporary assistance group will provide assistance. Other families of revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, and workers can generally solve their own difficulties, but if they have temporary and special difficulties that cannot be solved, flexible assistance will be provided to solve them. After the rain in Ningnan, all the members of the Dongwang East Town Farmers' Association ensured that the military families could sow in a timely manner, assisting 74 households in seven days, plowing 3.436 hectares of land and sowing 2.1 hectares of sorghum. Primary school students in various villages in Longping Chengguan school district established support-the-army groups. The 51 students of Xifu Primary School were divided into nine groups, and in the competition between the groups, they carried water, pushed grinding stones, ground grain, gathered firewood, dug land, weeded wheat, and built wall tops for the military families. Wang Laojing, a family member of a military personnel, said happily: "Chairman Mao will lead us, and the primary school students are different from the past. They take care of the chores at home really well."
