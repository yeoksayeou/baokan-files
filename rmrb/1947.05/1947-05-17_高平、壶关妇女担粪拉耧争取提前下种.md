    Women Carry Manure and Pull Seed Drills to Strive for Early Planting
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 14th dispatch] The first, fourth, and sixth districts of Gaoping widely organized women to launch a spring plowing campaign. After some men in Minghe Village, First District, joined the war, more than forty women in the village organized to concentrate on plowing, combining male and full-year labor, first plowing for military personnel, cadres, families of martyrs, and civilian laborers participating in the war. Women in Lunqiaokou Village organized three mutual aid teams, combined with male mutual aid teams, and planted 24 mu of cotton in seven days, already planting land for participating civilian laborers, military personnel, cadres, and families of martyrs. Yang Zhen'e and four other women from Qinzhuang hoed 11 mu of stubble in three days. Six women with bound feet in Sanshen Village, Fourth District, carried 50 loads of manure and hoed 3 mu of stubble in one afternoon. Coincidentally, they also had to make military shoes, so they made shoes at night and went to the fields during the day, motivating more than 100 women in the village to go to the fields together. Wang, an elderly military family member from Beiguanzhuang, personally carried manure and competed with young women, motivating all the women in the village to organize. Jiao Yin'e, Liu Xisui, and other military family members in Xinzhuang, Sixth District, refused preferential treatment from the masses and ran around mobilizing all the women in the village to participate in agricultural labor. Du Xiaoluo, a woman with bound feet in Beishi Village, carried several loads of manure and, with increased confidence, took the lead in mobilizing all the women with bound feet in the village to go to the fields. Due to the organization of women, the difficulties of manpower and animal power were overcome, and spring plowing in the above three districts can be shortened by one-third of the time.
    [This newspaper, Huguan dispatch] Women have played a key role in spring plowing and sowing. When Baichi Village held a women's meeting to discuss what to do when men were fighting Lao Jiang at the front and planting land in the rear, Niu Qiucheng's wife, a cooperative hero, said: "The men are going to war, we will take care of planting." Under the slogan "The whole village is changing labor, men and women compete as heroes" in Nanxingtou Village, military family member Wang Migui (female) personally led a women's team to pull seed drills, arrange seed drills, pull stone rollers, carry manure, and carry bank soil. Under her influence, all men, women, young and old in the village were mobilized to actively produce and complete planting ahead of schedule. Women cadres in the Third District automatically discussed and determined the standards for women to make contributions. Zhao Fengshan's mother in Cuijia Palm is 62 years old, has one blind eye, and carries manure to the fields early every day, actively producing. Under the promotion of Zhang Gaixiang and military family member Feng Dongji and other women in Shuzhang, all the women in the village turned out to launch a planting campaign, proposing: "Go to the fields during the day and spin cotton at night, launch a spring planting campaign to get the seeds down." In thirteen days, 218 women in the village dug more than 1,200 mu of gullies and plowed more than 1,400 mu of land, combining with the men to plant all of the more than 3,000 mu of land. Yuan Xiaogui (female), a military family member from Wang Liushui, actively produced herself, refused help from the masses, and helped others produce.

    妇女担粪拉耧争取提前下种
    【本报太岳十四日电】高平一、四、六区广泛组织妇女突击春耕。一区鸣和村部分男人参战后，全村四十多个妇女便组织起来，结合男全年劳力突击耕地，先给军、干、烈属和参战民夫耕种。纶桥口村妇女组织三个互助组，和男互助组结合，七天种棉二十四亩，已给参战民夫及军、干、烈属把地种上了。秦庄杨贞娥等五个妇女三天掘茬十一亩。四区三申村小脚妇女六人，一下午便担粪五十担，掘茬三亩，恰巧又要做军鞋，她们便黑夜做鞋，白天上地，推动了全村百余妇女一齐上地。北官庄军属王老太太，亲自担粪，并和年轻妇女比赛，推动全村妇女都组织起来。六区辛庄军属焦银娥、刘喜岁等，拒绝群众优待，并奔跑动员全村妇女参加农业劳动。北试村小脚妇女杜小洛，担了几担粪后，信心提高，以身作则，动员全村小脚妇女都上地，由于将妇女组织起来，克服了人力畜力的困难，上述三区春耕可缩短三分之一时间。
    【本报壶关讯】妇女在春耕下种中起了骨干作用。百尺村召开妇女会议讨论男人前方打老蒋，后方种地怎样办时，合作英雄牛秋成妻说：“男人去参战，种地由咱干。”南行头村在“全村大变工，男女比英雄”的口号下，军属王迷贵（女）亲领一个妇女组，拉耧、摆耧、拉砘子、担粪、担岸土。在她影响下，全村男女老少都动员起来，积极生产，提前完成下种。三区妇女干部自动讨论，确定了妇女立功标准。崔家掌赵风山的母亲已六十二岁，有一只眼瞎了，每天早早担上粪往地里送，积极生产，树掌在张改香和军属冯冬计等妇女推动下，全村妇女出动突击下种，提出了：“白天上地夜纺花，突击春种把种下。”全村妇女在十三天中二百一十八人，打圪垃一千二百余亩，刨地一千四百余亩，结合男人将三千余亩地全部下种。汪流水军属原小闺（女）自己积极生产，拒绝群众帮助，并帮助别人生产。
