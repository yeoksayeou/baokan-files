Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th. According to the Central News Agency: On the eve of the new Chiang-appointed Taiwan Provincial Chairman Wei Daoming taking office, a tragic suicide occurred in Taiwan involving a civil servant named Chen Boyin. Chen was from Longxi County, Fujian Province, and was an employee of the Chiang-appointed Taipei Municipal Education Bureau. He committed suicide by jumping in front of a train on the 14th. In his suicide note, he stated that the reason for his suicide was the persecution by the dark society caused by the greed and plunder of Chiang's officials, and that "suicide is an expression of resentment towards this kind of society." He also said: "Today's society (referring to Taiwan under the suppression of the Chiang government) has deprived me of my right to live. This is not only my tragedy, but a common tragedy faced by countless civil servants."
