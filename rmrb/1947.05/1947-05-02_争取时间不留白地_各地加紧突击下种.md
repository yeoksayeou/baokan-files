	Seize the Time, Leave No Land Idle:
	Various Regions Intensify Efforts to Rush Planting
	Breaking the Old Habit of Waiting for Rain, Jincheng Plants 20,000 Mu of Grain
	[Report from Taiyue by this Newspaper on the 30th] The Jincheng County government specifically instructed all districts to seize the time and rush planting. Initially, many people had the idea of waiting for rain; after plowing the land, they were not in a hurry to plant, believing that "this year the spring is late and the weather is cold, no need to rush; people can't rush, but the sky can in a flash. As long as it rains, planting will bring a harvest." Therefore, the cadres calculated for the masses: first, the labor force account, how many people and livestock would be leaving to support the front; second, the livelihood account, how much land to plant, how much land do military families and people supporting the front have; and finally, the time account, Qingming has passed, and Guyu is approaching, as the saying goes: "Rather rush to plant in the third month, than wait for rain in the fourth." This changed the thinking of the masses, and they quickly rushed to plant. After the masses in Dongzhuang Village changed their thinking, they organized 115 full and semi-laborers, of whom 61 were women. In addition to weeding wheat seedlings, they also planted together with the male laborers. A number of villages, including Wumen, Nanpan, and Qiaoxi, have completed their rush planting.
	Shimin Organizes All Full and Semi-Laborers to Help Military Families Plant First
	[Report from Taiyue by this Newspaper on the 30th] Shimin supports the front without neglecting production, closely integrating participation in the war with production throughout the county. At the beginning of spring, the county emphasized organizing semi-laborers to participate in agricultural production. The Liu Mianrong mutual aid team in Huojia Mountain proposed "men participate in the war, women weave and cultivate," organizing all the women, children, and disabled people in the village to work in the fields. Currently, all 3,861 mu of autumn land in the village have been cultivated, and 1,800 mu of wheat seedlings have been weeded. They are now rushing to plant. In Duanshi Town, District 1, 53% of the population, excluding those participating in the war, has been organized, and merchants and peddlers have been encouraged to participate in agricultural mutual aid, engaging in agricultural production in the mornings and afternoons, and doing business at noon. Owners of shops such as Fuhe and Yuanshun are automatically taking turns planting land for the families of soldiers participating in the war. In the past, Duanshi did not apply fertilizer to distant fields, but this year, both distant and nearby fields are being fertilized. For example, Ren Heike said, "I have accumulated five years' worth of manure, but it is not enough for the land this year." The mutual aid teams in Bali Village, District 5, have corrected the past practice of prioritizing planting for cadres and activists, instead prioritizing planting for military families, cadre families, families of martyrs, and soldiers participating in the war, making the mutual aid teams more solid. When the 36 participants departed for war, the masses assured them, "Go with peace of mind, what delays our crops won't delay yours." Currently, 90% of the village's arable land has been completed, and some has been planted. Cadres in Shayao Village, District 4, regard leading mutual aid teams in production and participation in the war as their own criteria for meritorious service, organizing all the labor force in the village, including landlords, to engage in production.
	War Participants and Those Staying Home Compete with Each Other: Heshun County Rushes to Plant
	[Report from This Newspaper] Heshun County is universally launching a rush planting campaign. After participating in the war, villages such as Songyan in District 3 established a rush planting committee to ensure that planting was not affected. Under the committee, there were organization, adjustment of superior seeds, and propaganda sections. All full and semi-laborers were organized into the planting campaign, and 140.8 mu of Jin Huanghou and yam were planted in half a day. After receiving the notice of participation in the war, District 1 held meetings for various systems. Those participating in the war and those staying at home made competitive proposals to each other. Zhang Chengke said, "I guarantee that my team will plant for those going to war first, and will not let an acre of land be wasted." Then, women like Li Chundi said, "In order to support those going to war, we women will also go to the fields to rush planting." Qi Cunbao, who was going to participate in the war, said with emotion, "I will not come back until I defeat Chiang Kai-shek, and I will never desert." The entire district completed planting 8,000 mu of land in three days. Village chiefs, political directors, and militia captains in District 2 were all vying to participate in the war. Bai Yubao and others said, "I have long been prepared to participate in the war, and I will not rest easy until Chiang Kai-shek is eliminated." Their enthusiasm for participating in the war encouraged the mutual aid enthusiasm of those staying at home. Song Youbao and Yao Fensheng have already finished planting grain for those going to war. Since receiving the order to participate in the war, Dongguan in District 1 held mobilization meetings for each team, and organized auxiliary laborers to work together and rush planting. Under the mutual challenge between teams and groups, in five days, in addition to planting 485 mu of grain and 121.5 mu of yam, they also planted 26 mu of spring wheat.
	Sweeping Away the Paralysis of Late Spring: Paiheng Completes Cotton Field Planting
	[Report from This Newspaper, Ping Shun] On the 28th day of the second lunar month, Paiheng Village, District 1, held a cadres' meeting (from team leaders and above, but below the captain) at night to discuss the issue of planting cotton early. First, they exposed their thoughts; many people said that this year the spring is late and the weather is cold, and the soil is also dry, so it is too early to plant cotton. Then, the village technical committee and the first team leader, Fan Qiangui, and others pointed out: don't be afraid of the cold weather, as long as the cotton seeds are soaked in water to suit the temperature of the climate, they will naturally germinate and emerge from the soil. Regarding the view of late spring, everyone made a calculation: the village only has 87 full laborers and 42 semi-laborers, and 28 full laborers have left to participate in the war. Now there are only 59 full laborers, and they have to plant more than 2,264 mu of land, averaging 27.3 mu per laborer. Calculating from now until the end of the sowing season, the time is very short. If it is not completed in advance, the task of participating in the war is urgent, and the labor force may be reduced at any time, which will delay the planting. At the same time, if cotton is not planted, this year's "cultivate two, spare one" will be a problem, and there will be difficulties in clothing. This cleared everyone's thinking. On the 29th day of the lunar month, the six mutual aid groups in the village scrambled to get up early and carry water from the hemp pond to plant cotton. They also organized 24 men, women, and children to participate in the mutual aid groups to scoop water and sow seeds. The most exemplary of the elderly was Guo Hongze. He was 50 years old, but he got up earlier than the young adults in this campaign, and he could see the knack of planting cotton. He said: Cotton seeds can only be sown two fingers deep, otherwise they will not easily sprout. He also studied that you should first scoop water and wait for the water to seep in before putting in the cotton seeds, otherwise, the soil and water will stick together and surround the cotton seeds, making it difficult for them to sprout. The whole village, young and old, worked together, and in just three days, they completed 356 mu of cotton fields, averaging 4.45 mu per laborer. (Jiao Tong, Qing Yun, Fu Ze)

　　争取时间不留白地
    各地加紧突击下种
    打破等雨旧习惯晋城种谷两万亩
    【本报太岳卅日电】晋城县政府特指示各区抓紧时间，突击下种，现有两万亩谷物已经下种。起初不少群众存在等雨思想；犁地后并不着急下种，他们认为“今年春深天冷不用急；人急没办法，天急一顿饭，只要天有雨，种下就能收”。于是干部就给群众算账；首先算劳力账，支前要走多少人，多少牲畜；其次算生活账，种多少地，军属、支前群众的土地有多少；最后算时间账，清明过谷雨到，俗话说：“宁抢三月土，不等四月雨。”这才转变了群众思想，迅速突击下种。东庄村群众思想打通后，组织全半劳力一百一十五人，妇女即占六十一人，她们除锄完麦苗外，又和男劳力一块下种。现已完成突击下种者有五门、南畔、桥西等十数村庄。
    士敏组织全半劳力尽先帮助军属下种
    【本报太岳卅日电】士敏支前不误生产，全县参战生产密切结合。该县开春即强调组织半劳力参加农业生产，霍家山刘绵荣互助大队提出“男人参战女人耕织”，将全村的妇女及儿童残废都组织起来下地劳动。现全村秋地三千八百六十一亩业已耕完，麦苗一千八百亩亦锄过，正突击下种。一区端氏镇除参战人员外，组织起来人口已达百分之五十三，并推动了商民小贩参加农业互助，早上与下午参加农业生产，中午营业，复和、元顺等商号主人自动轮流给参战民夫家属种地。端氏过去远地皆不上粪，今年远地与近地一样上粪，如任黑科说：“我积了五年的粪都没有担出，今年还不够上地。”五区八里村互助组纠正了过去首先给干部积极分子种地的现象，而是先给军、干、烈属及参战民夫种地，使互助组更巩固起来。当参战的三十六人出发时，群众向他们保证说：“你们放心的去吧，庄稼误了我们的，误不了你们的。”现该村耕地已完成百分之九十，部分已下种。四区沙腰村干部将领导互助组生产参战作为自己的立功标准，将全村所有的劳动力包括地主在内都组织起来，进行生产。
    参战留家相互竞赛和顺全县突击下种
    【本报讯】和顺全县正普遍展开突击下种。三区松烟等村参战后，为使下种不受影响，成立了突击下种委员会，下分组织、调剂优抗、宣传等股，将全半劳力一齐组织到下种运动中，半天内就种了金皇后、山药蛋一百四十亩八分。一区接到参战通知后，召开各系统会议时，参战的和在家的互相提出竞赛，张成科说：“保证我这组先给去参战的下种，不让荒了一亩地。”接着妇女李春第等说：“为了去参战，俺妇女们也要上地突击下种。”去参战的祁存保感动的说：“我打不垮老蒋不回来，决不开小差。”全区在三天内，即完成八千亩地下种。二区村长、政治主任民兵队长都争着要去参战，白玉保等说：“我早已做了参战准备，不消灭老蒋不放心。”他们的参战热情鼓舞了在家的互助热情，宋有保姚奋生已先给去参战的种完了谷。一区东关自接参战命令后，各队召开了参战动员会，就将辅助劳力，组织了起来一齐动手，突击下种，在队与队，组与组的互相挑战下，在五天内已将四八五亩谷、一二一·五亩山药全部下种外，还种了二十六亩春麦。
    扫除春深麻痹思想排珩完成棉田下种
    【本报平顺讯】一区排珩村在阴历后二月廿八日，黑夜开了个组长以上队长以下的干部会议，圪拉提前种花问题。首先暴露思想；有许多人说；今年春深天气冷，况且土壤也干燥，种棉还嫌早些的错误想法，当由村技术委员会，及第一队队长范钱贵等提出说：天冷不怕，只要把棉籽用水浸过，使他适合气候的温度，自然就会萌芽出土了。对春深的观点，大家又做了个计算：全村全劳力才有八十七个，半劳力四十二个，而参战的走了二十八个全劳力，现在只有五十九个全劳力，要种二千二百六十四亩多的土地，平均每个劳力就耕种二十七亩三分。以现在计算到播种节令的末尾，时间是非常短促的，如果不提前完成，参战任务紧迫，劳力说不定啥时还会减少，这样就误了下种。同时棉花种不上，今年的耕二余一就成问题了，穿衣布也要受困难。这一来，打通了大家的思想。阴历廿九日，全村六个互助小组，就争先恐后的起早，抢着挑上麻池里的水，种起花来了，更组织了二十四个男女儿童，分别参加到互助组里，舀水点种籽。老年里最模范的是郭宏则，他五十岁了，但在这个运动中比壮年还起的早，并能从种棉中看出门道来，他说：棉籽种只能二指深，否则不容易出芽。还研究出，先舀水等水渗以后，再放棉籽，不然的话，泥土与水结在一块，把棉籽包围起来亦不易出芽。全村壮年老年儿童，三方面搞的一股劲，仅仅在三天工夫，就完成了三百五十六亩花地，每个劳力平均四亩四分半。（蛟童、青云、富则）
