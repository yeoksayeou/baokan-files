　　Severe Swine Fever in Lucheng
    [Report from Lucheng] Swine fever is very serious in various villages in Lucheng. Although all methods of treatment have been exhausted, none have been effective. Seeing swine fever spreading in various villages, the Nanma Cooperative Mill died 27 pigs in a few days. The Luhe Cooperative also lost 12 pigs. The Wangjiazhuang Cooperative lost seven or eight pigs in two or three days. The Weijiazhuang Cooperative was feeding 13 pigs, and seven have already died. Now there are still six pigs that are not eating. According to statistics from these four villages, a total of 50 pigs have died, not including the pigs that died from the masses, which has caused great losses to sideline production. The symptoms of swine fever are: after getting sick, they don't eat, they keep spinning, their extremities become cold, and after death, their bellies swell greatly. It is hoped that the agricultural and forestry bureaus of various regions and those who have studied swine epidemics will conduct further research based on the above situation and come up with a solution to urgently save this serious epidemic.

　　潞城猪瘟严重
    【本报潞城讯】潞城各村猪瘟很严重，虽用尽办法治疗，都不生效。眼看着猪瘟流行各村，南马合作社粉坊，几天死猪二十七个，潞河合作社也死了猪十二个，王家庄合作社在两三天内死猪七八个，魏家庄合作社喂猪十三个，已死了七个，现下还有猪六个都不吃食。现据这四个村的统计共死猪五十个，群众死的猪还不在内，对副业生产有极大损失。猪瘟病况是：得病后都不吃食，光发旋，四梢发冷，死后肚胀多大。望各地农林局及对猪疫有研究的人，根据上述情形再作研究，得出办法，急救这一严重瘟疫。
