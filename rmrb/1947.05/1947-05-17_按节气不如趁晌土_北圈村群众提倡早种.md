"It's Better to Plant According to Soil Moisture Than Solar Term"
Beiquan Village Masses Advocate Early Planting

[Report from our newspaper in Zuoquan] In Beiquan Village, Fifth District, the campaign to rush planting work was unable to progress for a long time. On April 29th, district cadre Li Yaofu went to the village to help. That night, he convened a meeting of all the villagers to discuss how to support the front lines and rush the planting. Five elders, including Zhang Liniu, argued that planting must follow the solar terms and that following them was beneficial. Then, three middle-aged people, including Zhang Naicheng, raised objections. They said, "Early planting of millet means early eating of rice, early marriage means early having of children; it’s better to plant according to soil moisture than solar term." They gave an example: "In 1943, during the famine, Naicheng planted according to the solar terms, and the average yield was one *dou* per *mu*." Then everyone debated, some saying early planting was good, others saying it was better to plant according to soil moisture. In the end, everyone agreed that early planting was more reliable. Beiquan has a total of 230 *mu* of land, of which more than 120 *mu* has already been planted. After this debate, everyone proposed a competition, guaranteeing to complete the planting within fifteen days.

[Another Report] Yao Zhonghui, a 39-year-old farmer from Houzhuang Village, based on his own experience, suggested that planting potatoes early would lead to a greater harvest. During the famine in 1943, Zhonghui planted one *mu* of potatoes. By June, he was so hungry that he had no choice but to dig up potatoes in the mountains to eat. He picked out the large ones to eat, leaving the small ones. When the potatoes matured in the autumn, he dug them up again. The small potatoes had grown better than the original large ones. After calculating, the actual harvest exceeded the expected yield. Since then, he has dug up potatoes once every year in June, and this method has benefited him greatly for several years. When discussing the spring plowing and rush planting campaign, he brought it up: the method of digging up potatoes is very simple. In June, when the potatoes are edible, pick out the large ones by hand and dig them up, leaving the small ones. However, potatoes must be planted early (two or three days before Qingming).

　　“按节气不如趁晌土”
    北圈村群众提倡早种
    【本报左权讯】五区北圈村突击下种工作，迟迟无法推动。四月二十九日，区干部李耀富赴该村帮助，当夜召开了全体群众会议，讨论如何支援前线，突击下种。老年人张来牛等五人主张：不按节令不行，按节令有好处。接着中年人张乃成等三人提出反对意见。他们说：“早种谷子早吃米，早娶老婆早得子，按节气不如趁晌土。”他们并举例说：“一九四三年，灾荒时，乃成按节气种地，一亩地平均打一斗。”接着大家都辩论起来，这个说是早种好，那个说还是趁晌土。最后大家一致认为还是早些下种有把握。北圈共有土地二百三十亩，已种一百二十余亩。经此次辩论后，大家提出竞赛，保证限十五天完成下种。
    【又讯】后庄村三十九岁的老农民姚忠会，从自己经验中提出山药蛋要早种就能多收。四三年灾荒时忠会种了一亩山药蛋，到六月间饿的无法支持，就去山里挖山药吃，拣大的都挖吃了，留下小蛋，到秋天山药成熟的时候，他又刨，小山药蛋长的胜过大山药蛋的原状，秋后计算，超过实收产量数。此后每年六月间就要把山药挖一次，此办法他连用数年，都得大利。在讨论春耕突击下种时，他才提出来：挖山药的办法很简单，六月间山药能吃时，用手拣大蛋挖了，留下小蛋，但是山药要早种（清明以前两、三日内下种）。
