　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi Front, 19th: This newspaper's special correspondent Wei Ming reports: The morning after the recovery of Panlong, this reporter inspected the town of Panlong. This peaceful village had been transformed into a world of bunkers by the invading Chiang Kai-shek's troops, with a cluster of fortresses extending in all directions within five miles. The fortresses, relying on the mountain ridges on the northeast, west, and south sides, stretched outwards one after another. They were all constructed according to the terrain, forming low and underground bunkers that were difficult to attack, complete with outer trenches, chevaux-de-frise, and even fields of landmines. Passing through the southern entrance to Panlong, there were three lines of barbed wire and deep trench fortifications, giving one the feeling of entering an important fortified zone. The People's Liberation Army was clearing the enemy's fortifications and landmines, with occasional explosions. The houses and cave dwellings in the town, which were yesterday Chiang Kai-shek's troops' bunkers, are now filled with the People's Liberation Army. The people are returning in succession with the victory of the People's Liberation Army. In a square in the east of the street, these suffering villagers are working with the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army to move piles of white flour and carry the corpses of Chiang Kai-shek's troops one by one to be buried outside the village. General Wang Zhen's troops, though having fought for two days and nights, were still radiant and chatting about the battle. They eagerly offered the reporter American "Morris" brand cigarettes, and each of them now had American weapons in their hands. On the commanding height of Jianshan, the reporter made a special trip to see the last Chiang Kai-shek's troops' position captured in the Panlong Regiment annihilation battle. Two fortresses were built on the top of Jianshan, each with an outer trench one zhang wide and one zhang deep, with a barbed wire fence and a chevaux-de-frise outside the trench. Now the fortifications inside and out were scattered with shrapnel from grenades and artillery shells. The enemy's machine-gun nests were littered with empty cartridge boxes. The reporter picked one up and saw the Chinese characters "American-made 7.9mm machine-gun bullets" on each cartridge box, showing that these were specially manufactured by American imperialism for Chiang Kai-shek to kill Chinese people. As the reporter left the main road and walked along the slope, a dozen or so captured Chiang Kai-shek officers and soldiers were walking listlessly towards the rear between these fortresses and trenches. Two months ago, this peaceful and prosperous town, only ninety li from Yan'an, was fortified by Hu Zongnan, but what use was a fortress?

　　蟠龙战后巡礼
    【新华社陕北前线十九日电】本报特派记者韦明报导：收复蟠龙的第二天清早记者巡视了蟠龙镇。这一和平村镇蒋胡军窜入后已变成碉堡世界，四周五里之内全是堡垒群。堡垒依东北西三面的山梁，一个接一个的向四面伸出；都依着地形构成不易进攻的低堡与地堡，均有外壕、鹿砦、更加以遍地的地雷阵地。后经蟠龙南面入口处，是三道铁丝网与地堡外壕的纵深工事，使人有进入重要要塞地带之感。解放军正在扫除敌人的工事和地雷，时有地雷炸响。镇内房屋和窑洞昨天还是蒋胡军的堡垒，现在已经住满了解放军。人民随着解放军的胜利络续回来了，在街东的一个广场上，这些遭难的乡亲们，正和解放军的战士一起在搬运着成堆的白面，并把蒋胡军的尸体一个一个抬到村外去掩埋。王震将军的部下虽经二昼夜的攻击战，但依然神采焕发的在谈笑着战斗经过。他们纷纷送记者以缴获的美国“摩立斯”牌香烟，他们每一个的手里现在都已换上了美式武器。在镇守的尖山顶上，记者特别去看了蟠龙团歼战中最后攻下的蒋胡军阵地。尖山顶上修筑有两个堡寨，每一个寨子有一道一丈宽一丈深的外壕，壕外是一道带刺的铁丝网和一道鹿砦。现在工事里外到处散满了手榴弹炮弹的铁片，敌人的机枪巢里摊满了一地的空弹匣，记者拣起来一看，每一个弹盒上面都有“美国造七九机枪弹”的中国字样，可见这是美帝国主义专门为蒋介石制造来杀中国人的。当记者离开大道顺着斜坡走去，在这些堡垒与壕堑之间，正走着十几个零星捉来的蒋军官兵，他们垂头丧气走向后方去。两个月前，这一仅离延安九十华里的和平繁荣的市镇，胡宗南把它要塞化了，但是要塞有什么用呢？”
