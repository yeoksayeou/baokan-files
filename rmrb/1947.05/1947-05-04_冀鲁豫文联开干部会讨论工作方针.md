　　Hebei-Shandong-Henan Federation of Literary and Art Circles Holds Cadre Meeting to Discuss Work Guidelines

　　On April 10th, the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Federation of Literary and Art Circles held a meeting of all cadres to discuss editorial guidelines, drama movement guidelines, folk art, ideological leadership, and other issues. The meeting lasted for five days, and after enthusiastic discussions, the following unified opinions were reached: (1) "Plain Literature and Art" is aimed at cadres at the district and company levels and above, as well as those with a middle school education or higher. "New Land" is aimed at cadres below the district and company levels and those with a middle school education or lower, and efforts should be made to cater to the tastes of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. "Pictorial" is aimed at the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. The principle for all three publications is to reflect the reality of the border area and integrate with the masses. (2) The Literary and Art Work Troupe will focus on developing the rural drama movement in this area, transforming existing folk art in this area, and creating new forms that better reflect the reality of this area. The Minyou Opera Troupe, transformed from a Peking opera troupe, will strive to create historical scripts with new viewpoints and stage historical plays with new viewpoints. The Pingju (a type of Chinese opera) troupe will strive to stage realistic dramas. The Mass Opera Troupe, transformed from a Gaodiao (a type of local opera) troupe, will strive to perform realistic dramas. Newly established rural opera troupes in various places are prohibited from buying old opera costumes and performing historical dramas. It is advocated that they perform dramas in various forms that reflect the reality of their own lives. (3) The Folk Art Department will focus on connecting with and transforming the vast number of rural artists who blow, sing, play, pull, draw, and carve, etc., to serve the reality of the border area. In the first half of the year, the focus will be on transforming foreign films, and in the second half of the year, the focus will be on transforming New Year pictures. At the end of the meeting, it was stipulated that a general meeting should be held every four months, and temporary emergency meetings could be convened at any time.
