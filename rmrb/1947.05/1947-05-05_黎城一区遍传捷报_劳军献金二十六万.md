　　[This newspaper, Licheng News] Good news spreads throughout the first district of Licheng

    260,000 Yuan Contributed for Troop Support
    [This newspaper, Licheng News] After hearing the great news that our army in northern Henan annihilated the Chiang bandit's Second Rapid Column and that the Chiang-Hu troops were eliminated in the western battlefield, the masses in various villages in the first district immediately held discussions in the people's schools. The masses joyfully celebrated the victory and voluntarily donated money, made comfort bags, and sewed vests and shorts for the soldiers. A total of thirty-three administrative villages in the district participated in the troop support movement, donating a total of 265,500 yuan, sewing 378 comfort bags, 23 vests, 7 shorts, 8 hats, 36 towels and rice bags, and more than 120 letters of appreciation, which have been sent to the front.

    [This newspaper, Licheng News] On April 24, after hearing the news of the victory in northern Henan, the masses in Renzhuang Village in the second district excitedly gathered to celebrate. They have family members who enlisted in the army and recently joined the militia on the front lines in northern Henan, making this victory even more glorious and personal to them. They spontaneously formed many groups to discuss how to support the front lines. The Shen Futian group proposed: "Combine supporting the war effort with production, dispatch laborers as soon as they are called, and sending munitions a minute earlier can mean fighting a minute longer to win." Several women's groups, including Gao Baohuan's, proposed: "Actively participate in production to replace the men who are fighting." The militiamen proposed: (1) Be well-prepared for combat and be ready to leave when called. (2) Combine production with intensified military training and learn skills to participate in the war. Other groups generally pledged to cultivate the land well for the military families and the militiamen participating in the war, and to write letters telling them to fight well and not worry about family production. After the meeting, they initiated donations of comfort goods, raising 18,600 yuan in silver dollars, three comfort bags, and seven letters of appreciation within one day, which were handed over to their representative—model cadre Shen Dazang—to take to the front to comfort the victorious army.

    [Also Reported] The masses in Xiasong Village gathered to celebrate the great victory on the northern Henan front and enthusiastically donated money to support the troops, contributing a total of 15,000 yuan in silver dollars and dozens of letters of appreciation. (He Long, Yu Chun)
