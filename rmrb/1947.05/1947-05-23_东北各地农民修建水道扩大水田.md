Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 21st: After obtaining water conservancy loans of 100 million yuan from the Northeast Political Council, farmers in various parts of Northeast China are extensively building waterways and dams, and developing paddy fields. The Jiliao Sub-district has issued 6 million yuan in water conservancy loans and 5 million yuan in agricultural loans for paddy fields, ensuring that all 57,000 hectares of paddy fields under its jurisdiction are planted this year. In Chongli District, Hunchun County, Jidong Sub-district, eight townships mobilized male and female farmers, along with carts and horses, totaling 12,950 laborers and 1,700 carpenters, with 889 carts. They completed the construction of a large waterway over 50 li long, which can irrigate 200,000 hectares of paddy fields. In Tonghe County, Songjiang Province, two large water trenches and eleven dams have been built successively. This year, the county plans to plant 4,000 hectares of paddy fields, a fourfold increase compared to last year. The Hei-Nen Provincial Government has also decided to build dikes along the West River in the suburbs of Qiqihar City, which will add 2,000 mu of good farmland in the Erjiatun area. In addition, four hundred Korean farmers in Zhuhe County, Songjiang Province, with the help of government agricultural loans for paddy fields, are collectively developing paddy fields. It is estimated that 500 hectares of paddy fields and 200 hectares of dry land can be cultivated this spring, and an increase of 8,000 shi of rice is expected this autumn.
