Everyone Talks
　　Celebrating Victory
    Making More Comfort Bags
    Frontline soldiers like the comfort bags we bring the most. It is said that giving them a comfort bag is better than giving them several pounds of pork or dozens of packs of cigarettes. When the soldiers receive the comfort bag and see the name and address of the person who sent the bag embroidered on it, they feel very close. The newly liberated soldiers are so envious that they say: "Your military-civilian relationship is really good, no wonder you fight so hard! Now that we have joined your troops, we must work hard to get this comfort bag and be honored!" Comrades and relatives! Make a few more comfort bags. There is no restriction on the material, as long as it is durable. Inside, put some walnuts and chestnuts, other local products, or cigarettes and small pipes are also acceptable. Soldiers can carry them on their bodies, not only to store small items such as toothbrushes, toothpaste, and soap, but also as souvenirs.
    Now that victories are coming one after another on the front line, we want everyone to take action, everyone to make them, and send them to the front as soon as possible.

    大家谈
　　庆贺胜利
    多做慰问袋
    前方战士，最喜欢我们带去的慰问袋，据说送他们一个慰问袋，比送他们几斤猪肉、几十包纸烟还强。战士们得到这个慰问袋，见袋上有绣的送袋人的姓名住址，颇感亲切。把解放过来的新战士都羡慕得说：“你们军民关系真好，怪不的你们打仗很有劲！我们参加了你们部队，也要努力干，得到这慰问袋，光荣光荣！”同志们亲属们！多做几个慰问袋。材料不限制，只要耐些就行。里边装些核桃栗子，其他土产物，或烟和小烟袋均可。战士们带在身上，既可以放些零碎东西，如牙刷、牙粉、肥皂，又可以做纪念品。
    现在前线胜利接连而来，我们要大家动手，人人都做，赶快送到前方。
