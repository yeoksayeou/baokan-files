　　[Benbao Ji Lu Yu 11th Dispatch] In the Jilu-Yu (Weishan Lake) western region, we have completely taken the initiative. From April 13th to 23rd, in just ten days, the guerrilla forces, in only four battles, captured two enemy strongholds and eliminated 230 enemies, seizing 14 light and heavy machine guns, creating a brilliant record in guerrilla warfare. On the night of the 13th, a part of the local corps violently attacked the puppet Fengxian County Security Regiment at Liu Yuanji. The battle lasted five minutes, and the enemy was completely routed, capturing 10 and killing 16, seizing 2 light machine guns, 21 rifles, and over a thousand rounds of ammunition. At dawn on the 21st, a part of our ×th Battalion launched a surprise attack on the puppet Security Regiment's 1st Battalion stationed at Sunzhai, west of Feng (County). After fierce hand-to-hand combat, we captured over 20 enemies, killed and wounded over 30, and seized 3 light machine guns and over 20 rifles. The remaining enemies scattered and fled. On the night of the 22nd, a part of our local corps, in conjunction with the Shanxian County Battalion, attacked Wangpingfang, the only stronghold of the Chiang army in our central area. The enemy fled at the news, and we immediately recovered the stronghold, eliminating a major scourge for the masses on the border of Shan (County) and Jin (Xiang). On the night of the 23rd, a certain battalion of ours forcefully attacked Jialou, a powerful stronghold of the Chiang army north of Shanxian County, and stormed into the village in one fell swoop, capturing over 100 enemies, killing over 50, and seizing 2 Type 92 heavy machine guns, 7 light machine guns, and over 10,000 rounds of ammunition.
