Research on Solving Labor Shortages and Stabilizing Wages
　　Shang Feng, Jiang He, Jian Fu
　　Currently, in various villages in the Second District of Licheng, since the launch of the spring plowing campaign, wages for agricultural mutual aid teams have generally increased. For example, in villages near factories, the daily wage for mutual aid teams is thirteen jin of newly weighed millet per worker, in addition to meals; in villages near the Handan-Changzhi Highway and the city, it is ten jin of newly weighed millet per worker, in addition to meals; and in remote villages with poor road access, it is eight jin of newly weighed millet per worker, in addition to meals. Wages in Beiliu Village are lower, but still seven jin of newly weighed millet per worker, in addition to meals; if no meals are provided, it is increased by two jin. For year-round hired laborers, it is six big dou of millet per month near the city, equivalent to one hundred and ninety-eight jin of newly weighed millet, or six and a half jin per day. A household in Xiliu Village, Lucheng, was desperate to find a long-term worker, and eventually hired one for three big dou of millet and four big dou of wheat per month. In the Beiliu Village area, the average income per mu of land is three big dou and six sheng of millet, equivalent to seven dou and two sheng of market dou, totaling one hundred and eighteen jin. Assuming that organizing increases labor efficiency by an average of thirty percent per mu, 7.5 man-days and 2 animal-days are required, totaling 11.5 man-days. If each worker is paid the current "minimum" wage for mutual aid teams of seven jin of millet, then 80.5 jin of millet is required per mu. If we also consider reinvestment in production, each mu (3.6 he of millet for seeds, 30 loads of fertilizer equivalent to 2 dou of millet) requires 33.5 jin of millet, and if we consider the burden of millet at 26%, each mu requires 31 jin of millet, and meal expenses require 23 jin of millet per mu, the total expenditure per mu is 168 jin of millet. Subtracting the 118 jin of millet that can be earned per mu, there is still a deficit of 50 jin of millet. If we calculate based on the maximum and average wages, the deficit per mu would be even greater; and current wages are not limited to this amount, and may continue to increase with the busy farming season in the future. Farmers feel very distressed by such high wages, especially farmers who lack labor, such as newly turned farmers, military cadres' families, and orphans, who feel that farming is losing money. Therefore, the masses reflect: "Today, people are supporting the land, not the land supporting the people."

　　With the rise in wages, the masses have the following reactions to agricultural production: One is to reduce the scope of production, with some people willing to give their land to others for temporary management, while they go out to work; others reflect: "Let's ask the higher authorities if we can not farm?" For example, Zhang Chouhai and his son in Beiliu Village went out to work, leaving their sixteen mu of land, unwilling to manage it themselves, and willing to give it to others to cultivate without compensation, but they couldn't find anyone to take it. Another is to plant more labor-saving crops (such as beans), while special crops (such as cotton Golden Queen) are generally reduced due to labor-intensive work. For example, Cheng Changhai (former middle peasant) in Lubao planted all beans except for three mu of wheat on his sixteen mu of land, and some plan to plant more wheat, especially the planting of beans has generally increased. Of course, one of the reasons for planting more beans this year is the increase in livestock since the farmers turned over, and the current high price of beans; but the basic reasons are the high wages and lack of labor. For example, Cui Shuzhen in Fengzituo Village has a total of thirteen mu of land. Last year, she planted four mu of wheat, four mu of millet, two mu of beans, one mu of cotton, and two mu of corn; this year, due to the lack of labor, she plans to plant six mu of wheat, one mu of millet, four and a half mu of beans, and the rest all cotton (because she has female labor who can pick flowers), with the amount of labor-saving crops increasing by half.

　　Still another is not planning to cultivate deeply and meticulously, wanting to use a small amount of labor to plant a large amount of land. For example, carpenter Wang Shushan in Fengzituo said: "This year, I won't let the mutual aid team do work for me, and I don't plan to repair the edges and embankments of the land. When it's time to plant, I'll just drive the old ox to plow and sow at the same time, planting some every other furrow, and it will be enough to pay the burden in the fall. Saving labor is like earning money." Some people plan to hoe only once after planting. In short, in order to reduce wages, many people do not plan to cultivate deeply and meticulously.

　　The main reasons for the high wages are as follows:

　　First, ideological issues. People with the idea of being "content with what they have" are unwilling to rush the work. Originally, if they rushed the work, they would still have surplus labor to go out and plant for others; but because of the idea of being "content with what they have," they don't want to have a surplus. Even if some have surplus labor, they won't work for others, thinking that it's enough to have enough to eat and wear, why suffer that sin. For example, Liu Naisheng in Beiliu Village said: "You say the wages are high, but even if you give me ten thousand stones of gold, I won't go. It's enough for me to plant my own land." Another type of person, because of the idea of being "content with what they have," is unwilling to farm and prefers to engage in sideline occupations. Second, labor shortage. The reasons for the labor shortage are: on the one hand, participating in the war and supporting the front lines require a lot of labor. For example, in Beiliu Village, each able-bodied laborer must support the front lines for five days a month, not even including participation in the war. On the other hand, some villages have a severe shortage of labor due to the large number of people going out to join the army and participate in the war. Third, the profit difference between sideline occupations and agricultural wages is too large, affecting the rise in wages. For example, Zhang Yuku in Beiliu Village said: "I can earn more than a thousand yuan every day by engaging in sideline occupations, and if I do well, I can earn three or four thousand." Especially in villages along major roads and areas with developed sideline occupations, a large number of laborers are transferred from agriculture, and some even abandon agriculture to specialize in sideline occupations.

　　High wages, losing money from farming, and the labor input into agricultural production will not only not increase, but will decrease, which hinders the development of this year's great production movement. At the same time, those who lack labor today and are eagerly hoping for wages to fall are precisely the newly turned masses and the families of military cadres and orphans; while those with surplus labor are all the downgraded households who have been struggled against. How to solve and overcome the labor shortage and stabilize wages, we have the following suggestions for local reference: First, the most fundamental way to stabilize wages is to overcome the labor shortage. On the one hand, we should scientifically organize labor and use labor rationally; on the other hand, we should expand the labor force, so that the labor in agricultural mutual aid increases. The former is to overcome labor waste, and the latter is to increase labor. Both are indispensable. In particular, the latter is one of the most effective ways to overcome the labor shortage today. In addition to organizing all male full and semi-able-bodied and auxiliary labor, we should also organize a large number of female laborers into agricultural production. For example, in Fanjiagzhuang in the Second District of Licheng, after organizing all the male full and semi-able-bodied and auxiliary labor in the village, each laborer is still responsible for an average of 35.8 mu of cultivated land. If female laborers are organized and put into production, then each laborer averages 20.6 mu of land. This is the only way to ensure that the land is not left uncultivated. This tells us that without organizing female labor, the land cannot be cultivated at all, and it is entirely possible to organize female labor today, because on the one hand, the basic desire of the turned farmers is to develop wealth through mutual aid in production, and on the other hand, women have developed labor habits after several years of spinning and weaving campaigns. Take Beiliu Village as an example, although it is a model production village, very few women have invested in agricultural production. We should vigorously organize this part of the available labor and maximize its effectiveness to increase the amount of labor in agricultural production; secondly, we should organize labor well and combine it with production. Currently, various places have many new creations in combining participation in the war, supporting the front lines, and sideline occupations with agricultural production, which we should learn and apply. In the rational and scientific use of labor, we should also pay special attention to and create experience. For example, when hoeing wheat in Zhangjiashan Village, they completely organized children, old men, and semi-able-bodied laborers to hoe, saving the full-bodied laborers to do other heavier work; and in Renzhuang, they systematically organized semi-able-bodied and auxiliary laborers to undertake lighter and closer work, and stipulated a method of rewarding one work-day for each day out, which promoted enthusiasm and expanded the scope of supporting the front lines. These are two examples of rational, scientific, and planned use of labor, and various places should learn from and boldly create experience. Compress labor waste to the minimum, only in this way can the labor in agricultural production increase and stabilize the rise in wages.

　　Second, combining agriculture and sideline occupations. On the one hand, we cannot force the masses to stop sideline occupations and specialize in agriculture, because it is a fact that sideline occupations have high profits, and it is the masses' demand to engage in sideline occupations. We should satisfy this demand of the masses. On the other hand, we cannot specialize in sideline occupations and not engage in agriculture. It is a problem we should vigorously solve today to combine the two well and dispatch labor. Of course, the ideology of being "content with what you have" and the idea of valuing sideline occupations over agriculture must also be resolved. For example, Beiliu Village uses practical examples (Wu Manyou, a new rich peasant in the village) and accounting methods to break through the masses' ideology of being "content with what you have" and the idea of valuing sideline occupations over agriculture, and put forward the slogan "If you are rich, you will not be fought. If you have money, you must still have food. The two must be combined well." The basic thing is to solve the contradiction between agriculture and sideline occupations, rationally implement the profit distribution system of agriculture and sideline occupations, dispatch labor, and closely combine agriculture and sideline occupations, which is also a way to overcome the labor shortage in agriculture and stabilize wages.

　　解决劳力困难平抑工资的研究
    尚枫　江河　健夫
    目前黎城二区各村，在春耕运动开展后，农业互助组的工资普遍增高。如靠近有工厂的村庄，互助组工资每天除管饭外新秤小米十三斤，接近邯长公路及城附近的村庄，除管饭外新秤小米十斤，偏僻不通大路的村庄，每工工资除管饭外新秤小米八斤。北流村工资较低，但也是每工工资除管饭外新秤七斤，如不管饭都是增加二斤。长年雇工，城附近每月六大斗小米，合新秤一百九十八斤，每天合六斤半。潞城西流村某户，急的找不下长工，后每月以三大斗米、四大斗麦的代价雇一长工。按北流村一带，土地收入每亩平均小米三大斗六升，合市斗七斗二升，共一百一十八斤。每亩平均按组织起来增加劳动效率百分之三十计，需人工七个半，畜工二个，共合人工十一个半工。每工即按目前各地“最低”互助组工资小米七斤计，每亩需出小米八十斤半。如再算上再生产投资，每亩（种籽三合六小米，肥料三十驮合小米二斗）需小米三十三斤半，负担小米按百分之二十六计，每亩需出小米三十一斤，饭费每亩需出小米二十三斤，总计每亩共需支出小米一百六十八斤。除每亩能收入小米一百一十八斤外，尚空小米五十斤，如按最大和中等工资计算，则每亩的空数就更大了；而现在的工资还不限于此数，将来随着农忙的季节，还有继续增高的可能。这样高的工资，农民感到十分窘迫，特别是缺乏劳力的农民。如新翻身农民、军干属孤寡等户，更是感到种地赔钱。因此群众反映：“今天是人养地，不是地养人。”
    随着工资的上涨，群众对农业生产因而产生如下现象：一种是紧缩生产范围，有的人情愿白给别人土地，让其暂代经营，自己出外；有的则反映：“咱问问上级，能不能不种地呢？”如北流村张丑孩父子出外工作，家留的十六亩土地自己不愿经营，情愿无代价给别人耕种，但也找不下对象。另一种是多种省工作物（如豆类等），而特种作物（如棉花金皇后）因费工，普遍减少。如路堡程长海（旧中农）十六亩土地，除三亩麦外，全部是豆，有的计划多种麦，特别是种豆的普遍增加。当然今年农民翻身后牲口增加以及目前豆子价高，是多种豆的原因之一；但因工资太大、劳力缺乏，因而多种省工作物，都是基本原因。如风子驼村崔淑贞共地十三亩，去年种麦四亩、谷四亩、豆子二亩、棉花一亩、玉茭二亩；今年因劳力缺乏，计划种麦六亩、谷一亩、豆四亩半，其余全种棉花（因有女劳力能摘花），省工作物增加一半。
    再一种即是不拟深耕细作，想用少量的工，种多量的地。如风子驼木匠王书善说：“今年我就不让互助组给我做活，地也不计划修边垒堰，等到该下种时，赶上老牛去连耕带种，隔垅种上些，秋天够出负担就行了，省下工就顶赚了钱啦。”有的人则计划下种后锄一次就行了。总之，为了少出工资，许多人不计划深耕细作。
    造成工资高涨的原因，主要有如下三种：
    一、思想问题，由于存在圪瘩户思想的人不愿赶工，本来赶一赶还是有剩余劳力出外给别人种；但因有圪瘩户思想，所以就不想剩余了有的即使有剩余劳力，也不给别人做活，他们认为够吃够穿就行，何必受那罪。如北流村刘乃生说：“你说工资高，就是给我万石黄金，我也不去，够我自己种就行了。”另一种人因有圪瘩户思想，不愿种地愿搞副业。二、劳力缺乏。形成劳力缺乏的原因：一方面是因参战支差支付劳力很大，如北流村每个全劳力每月必须支五天差，尚未把参战计算在内。另一方面，有的村因出外参军参战人很多，形成劳力奇缺。三、因副业盈利与农业工资差额太大，影响工资上涨。如北流村张玉库说：“我每天搞副业怎样也赚千多元，弄好了也弄他个三、四千。”特别是沿大道村庄及副业发达的地区，大批劳力由农业上转移出去，甚至有的放弃农业专搞副业。
    工资高涨，种地赔钱，投入农业生产的劳力，不但不会增加，反而会减少，这对开展今年大生产运动是有妨碍的。同时今天缺乏劳力，日盼工资下跌的，正是新翻身的群众和军干属孤寡之户；而劳力有剩余的，都是被斗争过的下降户。如何解决与克服劳力困难平抑工资，我们有如下几点意见，以供各地参考：第一、平抑工资的最基本办法是克服劳力困难，一方面应科学的组织劳力，合理使用劳力；另方面是扩大劳力面，使农业互助上劳力增加。前者是克服劳力浪费，后者是增加劳力，两者缺一不可。特别是后者，更是今天克服劳力困难最有效的方法之一，我们除将男全半及辅助劳力全部组织起来外，还应将妇女劳力大批的组织到农业生产上。如黎城二区范家庄，把全村男全半辅助劳力组织起来后，每个劳力尚平均负担耕地卅五亩八分，如将妇女劳力组织起来投入生产，则每个劳力平均土地二十亩六分，这样才能保证不荒芜土地。这里告诉我们，不组织妇女劳力，土地根本种不了，而今天组织妇女劳力，是有充分可能的，因为一方面翻身农民要求生产互助发家致富是基本的，另方面妇女经过几年的纺织运动，有了劳动习惯。就拿北流村来说，虽然该村是个生产模范村，但妇女投入农业生产的还很少。这一部分可用的劳力，我们应大力组织起来，劳力效能使之发挥到最高限度，以增加农业生产上的劳力数量；其次应很好的组织劳力，使之结合生产。目前各地在参战支差及副业结合农业生产上，有许多新创造，我们应学习运用。在合理的科学的使用劳力上，也应特别注意与创造经验。如张家山村在锄麦时，完全组织了儿童老汉半劳力锄，节省下全劳力去做其他较重的生活；又如仁庄，有计划的组织半劳力辅助劳力担任较轻较近的生活，规定奖励出外一天计一工的办法，发扬了积极性，使支差面扩大了。这是两个合理的科学的有计划的使用劳力的范例，各地应学习与大胆创造经验。将劳力浪费压缩到最小限度，只有这样才能使农业生产上的劳力增加，平抑工资上涨。
    第二、农副业结合。一方面不能强迫群众停止副业专事农业，因为副业利润大是事实，搞副业倒是群众的要求，我们应满足群众这个要求，另方面也不能专搞副业，不事农业，两者使之很好结合，调度劳力，是我们今天应大力解决的问题。当然圪瘩户思想与重副轻农的思想也必须解决。如北流村用实际的例子（本村的吴满有——新富农）用算账的方法，来打通群众圪瘩户与重副轻农的思想，提出“富了不会斗，有了钱还得有粮食，两者总得结合好”的口号。基本的应解决农副业矛盾问题，合理执行农副业分红制，调度劳力，农副业密切结合，也是克服农业上劳力困难以及平抑工资的办法之一。
