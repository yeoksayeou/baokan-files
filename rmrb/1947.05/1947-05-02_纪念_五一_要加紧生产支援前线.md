　　Commemorating May Day by Intensifying Production to Support the Front Lines
　　Border Region Industry and Mining Bureau, Border Region Industry and Mining Bureau Workers' General Union

　　The annual May Day is coming again! This year's May Day arrives in an atmosphere filled with excitement and tension. The soldiers at the front are fighting intensely, striking the enemy everywhere, with frequent victories and abundant captures. Comrades on all fronts in the rear are intensifying work, production, and conservation to support the front lines.

　　The factories and mines under our Industry and Mining Department are launching a heated competition to increase production, perform meritorious service, and intensify support for the front lines.

　　Production was somewhat affected by wartime relocation, but in the process of building factories, the general production level has increased by one-third to one-half or more. The First Manufacturing Factory increased its production efficiency by one-half during the factory construction period. The Third Manufacturing Factory made great efforts to overcome difficulties during the factory construction movement, especially under the leadership of Section Chief Meng Feiyuan, where all electrical and mechanical workers worked hard to create and modify AC generators to solve the difficulty of electric power. This is worthy of commendation. The First and Second Factories of the Yongxing Printing Bureau have successively started large-scale production movements. Under the call of "Performing Meritorious Service for the People," a vigorous production competition has been launched, and work efficiency has been greatly improved. Comrade Gong Yinxiang, a worker in the binding department, used to fold 3,500 pages a day, but now folds 5,000 pages of double-printed hemp paper books a day. Cao Weixin, a foundry worker at the Second Machine Manufacturing Factory, used to take nine days to cast a set of gears, but now casts a set in three days. Zhen Wanghe, a machinist at the same factory, used to only turn one figure-eight wheel a day, but now turns seven figure-eight wheels a day. This astonishing increase in labor efficiency is manifested by the workers' high degree of enthusiasm for supporting the front lines and is a good example worthy of learning.

　　The call to "Save Money and Donate to Support the Front Lines" has quickly formed a surge in various units. Institutions and factories have been drawn into this movement. Within the institutions, they are saving production funds and reducing the burden on the public. Some receive all supplies and donate half, some receive a quarter, and many save everything except for food. Among the 27 cadres in the Industry and Mining Bureau itself, eight do not receive any salary for the entire year, and everyone, including miscellaneous staff, saves. Cadres in the Industry and Mining Bureau Hospital and Yongxing Factory save a lot of money each month, receiving 100 catties less rice or 90 catties less rice in salary. In terms of production, some save 200 catties of rice or 150 catties of rice. (Production and operation units themselves have no production tasks, so this is all voluntary.) According to the funds received in April, the Industry and Mining Bureau's office received over 100,000 yuan, the ×× warehouse received 37,000 yuan, the Fengfeng Mining Area received over 8,977,800 yuan, Yongxing received 147,900 yuan, the First Machine Manufacturing Factory received over 21,000 yuan and 50 catties of rice, and Guo'erzhuang received over 130,000 yuan, for a total of 50 catties of rice and over 9 million yuan. Some units have not yet sent their contributions, and most of the individual and overall production savings plans have now been received.

　　The savings of factory and mine production units are focused on saving raw materials and cherishing tools. Each factory has been creative in this regard and has come up with many methods. The Yuan Car Department of the Second Machine Manufacturing Factory has adopted the following methods to save raw materials and cherish tools: 1. When washing oil, first heat the oil pot over a fire so that every drop of oil drips into the oil hole. 2. Used rags are not thrown away indiscriminately, but are collected and handed over to the general affairs section to be washed with alkaline water before reuse. 3. When turning steel or hardware, the swarf of steel or hardware that is turned off is collected for casting other useful items. 4. Use water or soapy water instead of grease when drilling holes. 5. Sprinkle water before and after sweeping the machine room to prevent dust from flying onto the machines, which can reduce the amount of oil used to wipe the machines each month. These were formulated by the workers themselves, which shows the workers' sense of ownership and a strong sense of responsibility.

　　The workers and staff of the Fengfeng Mining Area launched a long-term labor and coal donation movement to support the front lines. They decided to launch a long-term production support movement for the front lines, with all workers and staff donating labor and the coal mines donating coal on the first of each month. This started in April, and their labor and coal donations have reached more than 8 million yuan. This is indeed a strong support for the front lines and has become a model for the labor donation movement.

　　In this production upsurge, we have made great achievements and produced many heroic models. This is our contribution to the people, this is our merit, and this is our glory. Currently, some units have not yet entered the production movement, and production efficiency has not yet reached the appropriate level; in some units, the production savings support movement is limited to a few people and has not yet formed a movement. Therefore, in the future: 1. In the various units that have already launched the production movement, cherish the gains that have been made, promptly check the movement, summarize experiences, so that the movement becomes widespread and goes deeper, reward meritorious workers and staff, and propose "add merit to merit, and take pride in having more and greater merit." 2. Units that have not yet entered the movement should improve work efficiency, intensify preparations, and strive to catch up with advanced factories more quickly. 3. Units where the production savings support movement has not yet formed a movement should conduct in-depth work inspections, find out the reasons, and open up thinking. Vigorously develop the merit-making movement, and through the merit-making movement, transform production savings and support for the front lines into a mass movement.

　　The war has now entered a new stage, the enemy is on the decline, and the day of a full-scale counter-offensive is not far away. Victory at the front and our good work in supporting the front lines in the rear are equally meritorious. Our factories, mines, and railways should pay attention to consolidating production enthusiasm, adding merit to merit, and pushing this year's production merit-making movement further forward.

　　Finally, we pay tribute to all workers and staff on all production posts! We pay tribute to the workers and staff who have made meritorious contributions to production!

　　纪念“五一”要加紧生产支援前线
    边区工矿局　边区工矿局职工总会
    一年一度的“五一”节又降临了！今年的“五一”节是在到处充溢着兴奋紧张的气氛中来临的，前方将士正在紧张作战，到处打击敌人，胜利频传，缴获极丰。后方各个战线的同志，都在加紧工作、生产、节约支援前线。
    我工矿处所属工厂矿山，则正在开展着一个热烈的竞赛增产立功，加紧支援前线的运动。
    在生产上曾因战争转移而受了一些影响，但在建厂的过程中，一般的生产水准也已提高三分之一至二分之一以上，第一制造厂在建厂时期，其生产效率提高到二分之一，第三制造厂在建厂运动中，曾极力克服困难，尤其是在孟科长非远同志领导下，全体电工机械工人同志努力创改交流发电机，解决电动力的困难，是值得表扬的。永兴印刷局第一、二厂已先后开始了大生产运动，在“为民立功”的号召下，展开了蓬蓬勃勃的生产竞赛，工效大大提高。装订部工人贡银香同志，过去一天摺页三千五百，现在一天摺双印麻纸书页五千。第二机械制造厂翻砂工人曹惟新，过去翻一套牙轮须九天，现在三天就翻一套。该厂机工甄旺合原先一天只旋一个八字轮，现在已提到每日旋七个八字轮。这种劳动效率惊人的提高，是在工人高度发扬了支援前线热忱下表现出来的，是值得学习的好榜样。
    “节约献金支援前线”的号召，在各单位亦很快形成热潮。机关工厂都卷入了这一运动，在机关内是节约生产献金，减少公家负担，有领全部供给一半者，有领四分之一者，还有很多人除伙食外全部节约的。在工矿局本身干部二十七人中全年全部不领的八人，其他连杂务人员在内，无不节约。工矿局医院、永兴工厂干部有节约每月少领薪金一百斤米的九十斤米的很多，生产方面有二百斤米的，一百五十斤米的。（生产经营单位本身无生产任务这都是自觉的）就四月已收到的款计工矿局机关十万余元，××仓库三万七千元，峰峰工矿区计八百九十七万七千八百余元，永兴十四万七千九百元，第一机器制造厂二万一千余元，米五十斤。郭二庄十三万余元，共计收米五十斤及九百余万元。还有些单位没有送来，现并收到大部个人的与全体的生产节约计划。
    工厂矿山生产单位的节约，是放在节省原料、爱护工具上，在这一点各厂都有创造，想出很多办法，第二机器制造厂元车部的节省原料爱护工具，采取了以下办法：一、洗油时先把油壶放火上烤好使每滴油都滴到油眼内。二、用过的破布不胡掷，都集中起来交总务股，用碱水洗过再用。三、旋钢活或五金时，把旋掉的钢或五金的碎末收起来，以便铸别的活用。四、钻眼时用水或肥皂水代脂油。五、机房扫地前后泼水，免得灰土飞到机器上，每月可少用油擦机器。这是工人自己订的，这显出了工人们的主人翁的自觉与强烈的责任心。
    峰峰矿区的职工展开了支援前线的长期献工、献煤运动，他们定每月一号全体职工献工、煤矿献煤的长期生产支援前线运动。自四月就开始了，他们的献工、献煤已达八百多万元。这对前方说确是个有力的支援，已成为献工运动的模范。
    在这一生产热潮中，我们作出了很大的成绩，出现了不少的英雄模范，这是我们对人民的贡献，这是我们的功劳，也是我们的光荣。目前还有些单位未进入生产运动，生产效率还未提到应有的程度；也有些单位，生产节约支援运动还限于少数人，尚未形成运动，因此今后：一、在已展开生产运动的各单位中，要珍贵既得成绩，及时检查运动，总结经验，使运动普遍并深入下去，奖励有功职工，提出“功上加功，以功多功大为光荣”。二、未进入运动各单位应提高工作效率，加紧准备工作，要更快的向先进厂看齐。三、生产节约支援前线运动尚未形成运动的单位，要深入工作检查，找出原因，打通思想。要大力开展立功运动，通过立功运动，把生产节约支援前线变成群众性的运动。
    目前战争已走向新阶段，敌人已走下坡路，全面反攻的日子已不远，前线胜利，我们后方支援前线工作作好是一样有功劳，我们的工厂、矿山、铁路应注意巩固生产热情，功上加功，把今年的生产立功运动更向前推动一步。
    最后我们向一切生产岗位上的职工同志们致敬！向生产有功的职工们致敬！
