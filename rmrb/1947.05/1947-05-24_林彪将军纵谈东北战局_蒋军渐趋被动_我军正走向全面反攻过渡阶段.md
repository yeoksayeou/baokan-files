　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 22nd: This reporter met with General Lin Biao, Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army, on the 19th in a certain location. With victory reports continuously arriving from various frontlines, General Lin, holding the just-received news of our army's recapture of Gongzhuling today, said with a smile and excitement to the reporter, "Yesterday last year, we withdrew from Siping; yesterday this year, we annihilated two enemy divisions. This day last year, we voluntarily evacuated Gongzhuling; today we have recaptured Gongzhuling, exactly one year!"

　　Then, he unfolded a map of the Northeast People's Self-Defense War of the past year and said, "This clearly shows the tremendous changes in the strength of the enemy and ourselves over the past year." He pointed out, "Over the past year, the Northeast People's Self-Defense War can be roughly divided into three stages. From Chiang's troops' attack on the Northeast to our army's voluntary withdrawal from Siping, until Chiang's troops occupied Andong and Tonghua, this was the first stage of the enemy advancing and us retreating. During this period, we adopted offensive defense, annihilating the enemy's active forces and preserving our own active forces; a portion of the top-notch American-equipped Chiang's troops was annihilated, and the enemy's combat effectiveness generally suffered great losses. The second stage was our army's three advances south of the Yangtze River and the enemy's four offenses against Linjiang last winter and this spring. The war situation in this period was a seesaw. In these several battles back and forth, we annihilated five enemy divisions, and successively recovered nine cities in Southern and Western Manchuria, causing the enemy to lose a great deal of maneuverability. From gradually taking the initiative to gradually becoming passive. Now we have moved from a seesaw war situation to a transitional stage of full-scale counter-offensive." He analyzed, "In the past, the enemy used the natural barrier of the Songhua River and their convenient transportation conditions to divide our North and South Manchuria; in the past, their forces were concentrated, and we were dispersed; now, times have changed, the strength of the enemy and ourselves is one declining and one rising, and the situation has changed. The obstacles of the Songhua River have also lost their effectiveness."

　　This genius strategist, the organizer of the world-renowned Defense of Siping, calmly and peacefully continued, "All of this should mainly be attributed to the masses, to the tens of thousands of cadres who went to the countryside to mobilize the masses starting last July. Because we implemented land reform, mobilized the masses, eliminated the Chiang-supported bandits in the rear, and initially built base areas, we were able to strengthen the main force, obtain a continuous stream of supplements and various operational support, and grow the counter-offensive forces, making the frontline of the Self-Defense War take on a new look. This is the decisive key to victory." He repeated, "The decisive key lies in mobilizing the masses." Then he said, "Taking last year's Battle of Siping as a turning point, the changes in the masses' emotions also developed in two directions. The traitor Chiang Kai-shek gave away the great rivers and mountains of the Northeast. The masses in the Northeast, who had been separated from the motherland for fourteen years, had reached the peak of their longing for the 'Central Government' due to blind orthodox concepts. Since we voluntarily withdrew from several areas, Chiang's officials and the masses generally met. From eating chickens, raping women, conscripting soldiers and collecting grain, to incorporating bandits and reusing puppet Manchukuo police, the people issued painful cries of 'the Second Manchukuo is here again,' gradually breaking their illusions about Chiang's troops. And we mobilized a large number of cadres to go to the countryside, sincerely serving the people, and began to unite with the masses, and the masses increasingly turned to us."

　　General Lin finally solemnly instructed the reporter, "Although the development of the war situation is unprecedentedly favorable to us, we should still know that the Northeast is still a newly liberated area, and our work still has many shortcomings, and the enemy is the main force of the Expeditionary Force of Chiang Kai-shek's most elite troops, and this area is still a place that the US and Chiang must compete for. Therefore, if we want to completely and thoroughly annihilate the enemy in the Northeast and end Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous civil war and dictatorial rule in the Northeast, we still need the common efforts of the front and the rear. Today, the task of our entire party and army in the Northeast is to actively organize forces, fully prepare for the counter-offensive, annihilate the enemy in large numbers, and consolidate and expand the liberated areas. To this end, the front must tirelessly and bravely conduct battles, annihilate the enemy in large numbers, and at the same time take the opportunity to conduct military and political education, and continuously improve combat effectiveness. The rear should continue to further strengthen mass work and continue to continuously support the front line with manpower and material resources. The victory of the war, in addition to relying on the bravery and skill of commanders and fighters, depends on the continuously growing strength of the people."

　　林彪将军纵谈东北战局
    蒋军渐趋被动
    我军正走向全面反攻过渡阶段
    【新华社东北二十二日电】记者十九日于某地会见东北民主联军总司令林彪将军。前线各地捷报，不断传来，林总司令拿着刚收到的我军本日收复公主岭的捷报，含笑兴奋地对记者说：“去年的昨日，我们退出四平；今年的昨日，我们消灭敌人两个师。去年之今日，我们主动撤离公主岭；今天我们又收复公主岭，恰恰是一周年了！”
    接着他展开一幅东北人民自卫战争一年来的形势图说：“这显明表示出，一年来敌我力量的巨大变化。”他指出：“一年来，东北人民自卫战争，大体可分作三个阶段。蒋军进攻东北到我军主动撤出四平，直至蒋军侵占安东、通化，这是敌进我退的第一阶段。这个时期里，我们是采取攻势防御，歼灭敌人的有生力量，保存自己的有生力量；将头等精锐的美械蒋军歼灭了一部分，敌战斗力普遍受到大的损失。第二阶段是去冬今春我军的三下江南和敌人的四犯临江，这个时期的战争形势是拉锯式的。在这一来一往的几次战役中，我们歼灭了敌人的五个师，南满、西满相继收复了九座城市，使敌人丧失了很大的机动力量。由主动渐趋被动。现在我们已经由拉锯式的战争形势，走向了全面反攻的过渡阶段。”他分析着：“敌人过去利用松花江的天险和他的交通便利的条件来分割我南北满；过去他们的兵力是集中的，我们是分散的；现在时移势易，敌我力量是一个下降，一个上升，形势变化了。松花江的险阻也失去作用了。”
    这位天才的战略家，名震中外的四平保卫战的组织者，镇静而安祥的继续说下去：“这一切主要的应当归功于群众，归功于去年七月起一万数千下乡去发动群众的干部。由于我们实行了土地改革，发动了群众，肃清了后方的蒋记土匪，初建了根据地，因此才能使主力壮大，得到源源不断的补充和各种作战的配合，生长了反攻力量，使自卫战争前线面貌为之一新。这就是胜利的决定关键。”他重复了一句：“决定的关键在发动群众。”接着说：“以去年的四平战役为转捩，群众情绪的变化也是向两方面发展的。卖国贼蒋介石断送了东北的大好河山，和祖国隔绝了十四年的东北群众，由于盲目的正统观念，“想中央、望中央”的热望，那时是到了顶点。自从我们主动撤出若干地区，蒋家官员们和群众普遍见面了，由吃小鸡、奸淫妇女、征兵征粮到收编土匪和起用伪满警察，人民发出“二满洲又来了”的苦痛呼声，逐渐打破了对蒋军的幻想。而我们则动员大批干部下乡，诚心诚意为人民服务，开始和群众结合，群众就日益转向我们了。”
    林总司令最后郑重的叮嘱记者：“战局的发展固然对我们空前有利，但是我们仍应知道东北还是一个新解放区，我们的工作还有许多缺点，而敌人又是蒋介石最精锐部队的远征军的主力，并且这个地区也仍然是美蒋必争之地。因此我们要想全部干净彻底的歼灭东北的敌人，结束蒋介石在东北的卖国内战独裁的统治，还须前后方共同大大努力。今天我东北全党全军的任务是积极组织力量，全力准备反攻，大量歼灭敌人，巩固和扩大解放区。为此，前方必须不倦的英勇的进行战斗，大量歼灭敌人，同时利用机会进行军政教育，不断的提高战斗力。后方则应当继续更进一步的加强群众工作，继续以人力物力源源支援前线。战争的胜利，除了靠指战员的英勇善战外，就靠人民不断的生长的力量。”
