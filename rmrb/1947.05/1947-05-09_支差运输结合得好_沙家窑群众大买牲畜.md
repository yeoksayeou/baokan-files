　　Good Combination of Labor Support and Transportation
    Sha Jia Yao Masses Buy Livestock in Large Numbers
    [Report from this newspaper in Tunliu] Sha Jia Zhuang pays attention to combining labor support with transportation, coupled with bank loan assistance, increasing the number of livestock by 25. On the 26th day of the second lunar month, Zhao Qiuxi, Fu Xiaofang and other ten ox carts went to Bozi, Qinyuan, to deliver public grain. On their return, they transported 1,950 catties of Lala Qiao [likely a local product], with a freight charge of 30 yuan per catty, earning a total of 58,500 yuan, which was handed over in Changzhi. On their return, they earned another 3,000 yuan in freight, totaling 61,500 yuan. In this way, the masses are not only happy to provide labor support, but also happy to buy livestock. At the same time, under the free association of the masses, Guo Tiancheng and 27 others organized three mutual aid teams. Because the principle of equivalent exchange is properly implemented (settlement of accounts is done every day at five s晌 [unit of time, approx. half a day], each work unit is worth five sheng of rice), each team is now competing in sowing. They even work at night to carry manure, and now the land has been repaired. In another ten days, the entire village's 16 hectares of land can be sown.

　　支差运输结合得好
    沙家窑群众大买牲畜
    【本报屯留讯】沙家庄注意支差与运输结合，加以银行贷款帮助，增加牲畜廿五头。阴历二月廿六日，赵秋喜、富小芳等十辆牛车，去沁源柏子送公粮，回来时拉拉翘一千九百五十斤，每斤脚价卅元，共赚洋五万八千五百元，送到长治交了脚，返回时又赚脚洋三千元，总共赚洋六万一千五百元。这样群众不仅高兴支差，而且高兴买牲口。同时在群众自由结合下，由郭天成等二十七人组织起了三个互助组，由于等价交换搞的适当（每日五晌算帐，每工五升米），现各组都竞争下种，黑夜还变工担粪，现把地都修好，再有十天可把全村十六顷地种完。
