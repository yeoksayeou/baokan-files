　　Thorough Land Reform and Public Land Distribution: Licheng's Henan Village Continues to Fill Gaps in Production
    [This Dispatch from Taihang, 10th of this month] In mid-April, Henan Village, Licheng, discovered that some people were not enthusiastic about production. They promptly encouraged free exposure of thoughts within the mutual aid teams. After eight days of discussion, many farmers said: "We are willing to 'cultivate three and surplus one,' but if we can't get good land, we won't be motivated. Two acres of land's yield can't match more than one acre of the landlord's land. Whether it's enough to eat is still a question, let alone having a surplus!" The leadership conducted an in-depth investigation and realized that although the amount of land had been equalized, the quality was still very disparate. The main reason was that the landlords had not been thoroughly struggled against. The major struggle target, landlord Han Qirui, had an average of 1.96 acres of land per person, yielding 5.35 shi. Landlord Jin Guicheng had an average of 3.07 acres of land per person, yielding 8.45 shi. Some middle peasants had an average of 2.55 acres of land per person, yielding 4.74 shi. Poor peasants (newly liberated households) had even less, with an average of 2 acres of land per person, yielding 3.37 shi. In addition, because class divisions were not clear, some landlords were given a share of the fruits after being struggled against. For example, Han Bingwen; his father was a feudal rich peasant who hired two long-term laborers and lent money at high interest rates. Although he had "cut off his tail" [confessed and given up some assets], he still received a share of the fruits after the struggle. The masses reflected, "Some people in our village don't know whether they are struggle targets or liberated peasants." Upon hearing this, the village cadres became clear-headed. The reason why the masses were not very motivated in production was because land reform was not thorough and the land was not publicly distributed. Therefore, they proposed a discussion within the mutual aid teams. After reports from various teams, it was discovered that there were still twelve households whose struggles were not thorough. They then concentrated their efforts, using one night school session to resolve all the issues. The peasants recovered another 39 acres of land, 37 house foundations, 17 houses, 609 silver dollars, and one catty of jewelry, which were reasonably distributed to land-poor peasants after evaluation by the appraisal committee. As a result of the distribution, liberated households had an average of 2.2 acres of land per person, and yields increased to 4 shi. The masses reflected, "It's thorough now!" Some said, "It's even more than the formal struggle last winter!" After the problems were solved, some wealthy peasants still had fears of being struggled against. The leadership then used the example of wealthy middle peasant Dong Manyuan to guide everyone in discussion. The Dong family had six acres of good land for three people, raised two big black mules, and made a lot of money from transportation, living better than anyone else, but they had not exploited anyone and were therefore not struggled against. After a review, and after this discussion, everyone's production enthusiasm was unprecedentedly high. Labor Hero Zhao Muqun's team was the first to set a ten-day production plan, which quickly promoted all the teams in the village to set short-term plans. Under his leadership, the three large canals (nine li long) were dredged in three days from April 23rd to 25th, one thousand loads of fertilizer were delivered in six days, all the dry land wheat of more than 400 acres was hoed, all the cotton fields with side ridges were repaired, and the autumn land was harrowed and raked once each. Hemp and potatoes were all planted.

　　翻身要翻透土地要分公
    黎城河南村生产中继续填补
    【本报太行十日电】黎城河南村在上月中旬发现一些人对生产不起劲，便及时在互助组里自由暴露思想。经过八天酝酿，许多农民说：“耕三余一是愿意，但分不上好地就没劲，二亩地产量顶不住人家（指地主）一亩多，够不够吃还是问题，怎么能有余剩？”领导上深入检查，才知道土地数量虽已填平，但质量还十分悬殊，主要原因是地主未斗透。大斗争对象地主韩启瑞每口平均土地一·九六亩，产量五·三五石。地主靳贵成每口平均地三·○七亩，产量八·四五石。而中农有的每口平均土地二·五五亩，产量四·七四石。贫农（新翻身户）更少，每口平均土地二亩，产量三·三七石。另外因阶级划分不明确，有些地主被斗争后又分得果实。如韩丙文，他父亲在时是个封建富农，过去雇两个长工并放高利贷，虽割过尾巴，但斗争过后又分得果实。群众反映说：“咱村里有些人就不知道是斗争对象，还是翻身农民。”这一来村干部清醒了，原来群众生产劲头不大，是因翻身不透，土地没分公。遂在互助组内提出讨论。经各组汇报，发现尚有十二户斗争不彻底。乃集中全力用一个夜校时间将问题全部解决。农民又收回土地三十九亩，房基三十七间，房子十七间，白洋六百零九元，首饰一斤，经评议会评定，合理分给少地农民。分配结果，翻身户每口平均土地二·二亩，产量提高到四石。群众反映说：“可彻底了！”有的说：“比去冬正式斗争时还得的多哩！”问题解决后，有些富裕农民仍有怕斗争思想，领导上即以富裕中农董满元为例，引导大家讨论。董家三口人六亩好地，喂两条大黑骡，运输赚钱多，比谁生活也好，但因没有剥削过人，即未斗争。经过复查，经过这次讨论，大家生产情绪空前高涨，劳英赵木群组首先订出十天生产计划，很快推动全村各组都订出短期计划。在他领导下，四月二十三至二十五三天内将三道大渠（九里长）浚元，六天内送粪一千驮，旱地麦四百余亩全部锄完，全部边堰棉花地修理好，秋地全部耙、耢各一次，大麻、山药蛋都下了种。
