　　Capturing Tanks
    The Battle Story of Annihilating a Rapid Column
    Chen Zhen, Wang Hutian
    As soon as the First Battalion of the 101st Regiment broke into Dahu Village, they saw a Chiang Kai-shek army tank at the east end of the village. Combat team leader Niu Yuhe shouted, "Capture the tank!" He led three soldiers, including Wang Yuanshun, each carrying two bags of lime, and ran up. The two rows of Chiang Kai-shek soldiers guarding the tank didn't care about anything and ran away. The short Wang Yuanshun jumped onto the tank from behind and quickly stuffed the lime bags into the gun holes and observation ports. Niu Yuhe rushed up with a hand grenade and shouted, "Don't move, or the grenade will go in!" The enemy and the tank obediently surrendered.
    The next day, more than 3,000 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers besieged in the village attempted to break through, using three tanks as cover. Battalion Commander Wu Xishan of our unit led the soldiers of the Sixth Company to meet them. A burst of hand grenades made all three tanks smoke and dare not move forward. The soldiers chased the Chiang Kai-shek soldiers, who ran all over the ground. Wu Xishan and two soldiers climbed onto the tanks, used a hammer to open the iron door on top, and two or three tank soldiers and an officer crawled out and surrendered their guns.

　　捉坦克
    歼灭快速纵队的战斗故事
    陈真　王虎田
    一○一一部一营刚一突进大胡营，就看到了村东头的一辆蒋军坦克，战斗小组长牛玉和喊着：“捉坦克啦”！他带着王元顺等三个战士，每人拿着两个石灰包，飞跑上去，守在坦克旁边的两排蒋军啥也不顾，撒腿就跑。矮个子王元顺从后面跃上坦克，很快的把石灰包从枪眼和了望孔里塞进去；牛玉和提着手榴弹赶上来喊道：“不要动，一动手榴弹就进去了！”敌人和坦克老实的做了俘虏。
    第二天被我包围在村子里的三千多蒋军，用三辆坦克掩护着，企图突围。我某部营长武锡山率六连战士迎击上去，一阵手榴弹，打的三辆坦克全身冒烟，不敢再往前爬了。战士们追的蒋军满地乱跑。武锡山和两个战士爬上坦克，用铁锤打开顶上的铁门，里面两三个坦克兵和一个军官钻出来缴了枪。
