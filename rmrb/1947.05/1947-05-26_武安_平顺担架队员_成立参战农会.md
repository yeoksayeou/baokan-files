　　Wu'an and Pingshun stretcher-bearers
  　Establish War Participation Farmers' Association
    [Report from Yu Bei by our newspaper] To ensure the smooth progress of logistics work, Wu'an and Pingshun have established War Participation Farmers' Associations. The Wu'an Second Brigade Transportation Team, and the Pingshun Second and Eighth Teams of stretcher-bearers, in order to better carry out logistics work and ensure the same complete victory as the frontline troops, have organized all the Farmers' Association members among the war participants to form the War Participation Farmers' Association. It was decided to form groups of ten people, with each company electing a Farmers' Association director, to regularly hold meetings to review work, and to set out three major tasks: First, bravely rescue and take good care of the wounded. Second, abide by mass discipline, strive to be models of cherishing the people, and implement the "three no departures" movement (do not leave without returning borrowed items to fellow villagers, do not leave without filling the water vat, do not leave without sweeping the courtyard). Third, monitor those who violate mass discipline and rumor-mongering agitators. Farmers' Association members account for 65 percent of the total team members. After being organized in this way, it has played a guaranteeing role in the war participation work. From the beginning until now, for more than a month, not a single person has deserted.

　　武安·平顺担架队员
  　成立参战农会
    【本报豫北讯】为保证后勤工作做好，武安、平顺成立参战农会。武安二大队运输队，和平顺二、八两队担架；为更好的把后勤工作做好，保证和前方军队取得同样的完全胜利。于是将参战人员中的农会会员，全部组织起来，成立了参战农会。决定十个人一组，每中队选一个农会主任，经常开会检讨工作，并定出三大任务：一、勇敢抢救和好好爱护彩号。二、遵守群众纪律，争取当民爱民模范，做到三不走（借老乡东西还不清不走，担不满水缸不走，扫不净院地不走）运动。三、监视破坏群众纪律的人、和造谣煽动分子。农会会员占全队人数百分之六十五，这样组织起来后，对参战工作，起了保证作用。从开始到现在，一个多月没一个开小差的。
