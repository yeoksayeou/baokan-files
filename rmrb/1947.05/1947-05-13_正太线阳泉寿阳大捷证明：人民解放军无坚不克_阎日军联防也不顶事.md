Xinhua News Agency, Jin察冀 (Jin-Chahar-Hebei) 11th—The Jin察冀 Daily recently published a commentary congratulating the great victory at Yangquan and Shouyang. It stated: This great victory annihilated the main force of Zhao Chengshou's troops of the Yan army and the Japanese "Peace Preservation Fifth Brigade" incorporated by Yan Xishan. The war was only 100 *li* west of Yan Xishan's lair, Taiyuan. The so-called "strong defense zone" and "Yan-Japanese Allied Forces" completely went bankrupt in the face of the Jin察冀 People's Liberation Army. Yan Xishan is already crying out "Defend Taiyuan!" Since April 9th, in the battles of Shijiazhuang perimeter and Zhengtai line, the People's Liberation Army has annihilated 35,000 of Chiang, Yan, Japanese and puppet troops, liberating seven county towns: Zhengding, Luancheng, Jingxing, Yu County, Dingxiang, Pingding and Shouyang, as well as the three major coal and iron mining areas of Jingxing, Yangquan, and Huangdanggou. They controlled the strategic pass of Niangziguan in Hebei and Shanxi and 70% of the entire Zhengtai Railway line. The Taihang and Hebei-Shanxi areas, which had been divided for a long time, have now been connected into one large area. Between the three major strategic regions of Jin察冀, Jin冀鲁豫 (Jin-Hebei-Shandong-Henan) and Shandong, except for the three isolated strongholds of Shijiazhuang, Huolu and Yuanshi, the area from Yuci in the west to the coast of the Bohai Sea in the east has been completely connected. The war is just beginning, and the fate of Taiyuan and Shijiazhuang symbolizes the doomsday of the Chiang dynasty.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengtai Front, 11th—Frontline reporters reported: The victory of a certain unit of the Jin察冀 People's Liberation Army in clearing the Yan-puppet military fortresses in the triangular area south of Sangzhang on the Zhengtai Road and east of Pingding to Yangquan powerfully announced the tragic failure of the fortress policy of Yan Xishan, the "Earth Emperor" of Shanxi. Yan Xishan not only built fortresses constructed by the Japanese invaders but also built more secret fortress groups. In the small area of only 15 square kilometers mentioned above, there were more than 60 fortresses of various sizes. Among them, the Jianglongzhuang fortress group was constructed on a 300-square-meter position, with a large bunker in the center of the position and 60 small bunkers around it, all with strong stone foundations and built with cement. The walls were about four feet thick, and their sturdiness can be imagined. The People's Liberation Army launched a fierce attack on this fortress group at 20:30 on the 24th. This small area was completely filled with artillery fire, and more than 60 bunkers trembled along with the earth, collapsing one by one. The PLA sappers and infantry swept through the enemy's fortifications and mines, and cleared out the remnants of the enemy. By 6:30 on the 25th, the fortress group in this strongly defended area was completely destroyed by the ever-victorious People's Army.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengtai Front, 11th—Frontline reporters reported: The Jin察冀 People's Liberation Army completely annihilated the Japanese "Peace Preservation Fifth Brigade" retained by Yan Xishan at Shinao Mountain southwest of Yangquan. The process was as follows: On May 30th, the Zhengtai line between Shouyang and Yangquan was cut off by the People's Liberation Army, and the Yan-puppet troops in Yangquan panicked and fled (Note: The Yan-puppet troops who fled west of Yangquan have all been annihilated). In a panic, Yan Xishan ordered the "Peace Preservation Fifth Brigade," composed of the former Japanese Fourth Independent Mixed Brigade, to defend Shinao Mountain southwest of Yangquan to the death, attempting to use the "bushido" of the "Japanese army" and the famous Shinao Mountain fortress from the Anti-Japanese War to make a final bet. A battle for Yangquan, mainly to seize Shinao Mountain, began. The People's Liberation Army's fierce artillery fire surrounded this high mountain, which overlooked the entire city of Yangquan. Brave people's fighters charged up the mountain, occupying the mountain layer by layer, compressing the Japanese army into a corner. On the 2nd, we completely liberated Yangquan, and the Japanese army on the mountain could no longer threaten the city. On the 3rd, the remaining Japanese soldiers lost all fighting spirit and stopped resisting at 2:00 PM. Their captain, Lan Xiongzhen (original name Fujita Nobuo, former brigade commander of the Japanese Independent Fourth Mixed Brigade), led more than 240 remaining soldiers and more than 150 family members to surrender to the People's Liberation Army.

　　正太线阳泉寿阳大捷证明：
    人民解放军无坚不克
    阎日军联防也不顶事
    【新华社晋察冀十一日电】此间晋察冀日报顷发表时评祝贺此次阳泉、寿阳大捷。略称：此次大捷，歼灭了阎军赵承绶部主力及阎锡山收编的日军保五大队，战争西距阎锡山老巢太原仅一百华里。所谓“坚强的设防地带”与“阎日联军”，在晋察冀人民解放军面前完全破产，阎锡山已在哀叫“保卫太原了”。四月九日以来，石庄外围与正太两役，人民解放军歼灭蒋、阎、日、伪军已达三万五千人，解放了正定、滦城、井陉、盂县、定襄、平定、寿阳七座县城及井陉、阳泉、黄丹沟三大煤铁矿区。控制了冀晋天险娘子关及正太全线百分之七十的铁路线。长期被分割的太行、冀晋两区，已在广大地面联成一片。晋察冀、晋冀鲁豫、山东三大战略地区之间，除石家庄、获鹿、元氏三个孤立据点外，西起榆次，东至渤海之滨，已完全联成一片。战争正在开始，太原和石家庄的命运正象征着蒋家皇朝的末日。
    【新华社正太前线十一日电】前线记者报导：晋察冀人民解放军某部扫清正太路桑掌以南、平定至阳泉以东三角地带内之阎伪军堡垒群的胜利，强有力的宣布了山西土皇帝阎锡山堡垒政策的惨败。阎锡山继日寇修筑的堡垒工事，又增修了更多的秘密堡垒群。仅在上述面积不过十五平方公里的狭小地区内，即筑有大小堡垒六十余座。其中蒋龙庄堡垒群构筑在一个三百平方公尺的阵地上，阵地中心为一大碉堡，四周共有六十个小碉堡，均有坚厚石基，用洋灰筑成，墙厚约四尺，其坚固程度可想而知。人民解放军于二十四日二十时三十分向这一堡垒群发动猛攻，这一狭小地完全为炮火所迷漫，六十余座碉堡随大地一齐颤抖，一座一座的倒下来。解放军的工兵与步兵一层一层的扫荡着敌人的工事与地雷，扫荡着残敌。到二十五日六时三十分，这一坚强设防地带的堡垒群，即为攻无不克的人民军队完全摧平。
    【新华社正太前线十一日电】前线记者报导：晋察冀人民解放军，于阳泉西南狮瑙山全歼为阎锡山留用之日军“保安五大队”经过称：五月三十日，正太线寿阳、阳泉间为人民解放军切断，阳泉阎伪军恐慌逃窜（按：阳泉西窜阎伪已全部被歼）。手忙脚乱的阎锡山命令由原日军第四混成旅团所组成之保安五大队死守阳泉西南的狮瑙山，企图利用“日军”的“武士道”和抗日战争中有名的狮瑙山要塞来下最后一个赌注。一个以争夺狮瑙山为主的阳泉争夺战开始了。人民解放军猛烈的炮火，包围了这座可以俯瞰阳泉全市的高山，英勇的人民战士往山上猛冲，逐层占领山地，将日军压缩于一隅。二日，我完全解放阳泉，山上日军已不能威胁该市。三日，残余日军斗志丧尽，于下午二时停止抵抗。由其队长兰雄信（原名藤田信雄，过去日军独立第四混成旅团大队长）率残部二百四十余名及其家属一百五十余名向人民解放军缴械投降。
