Xingtai Changxin Village Land Cultivation Methods
	Geng Qichang Li Pu
	Changxin Village in the Second District of Xingtai County is a newly liberated area with 372 households. In the past, the land cultivation issue was entirely based on an assignment system. If military families needed help, they would ask the cadres, who would then assign labor. Due to the lack of effective mobilization and education, the land cultivation work was not well done.

	This spring, after some ideological education, the masses discussed and decided who should receive land cultivation assistance and how much. The investigation and discussion resulted in the determination to provide land cultivation assistance to 39 households of military families, families of martyrs, and disabled or retired veterans. Due to the overall labor shortage, military families were also mobilized to participate in labor. As a result, six households did not require any land cultivation assistance at all, four households managed all their land themselves and only needed 100 workdays of assistance from the masses, and three households needed 80 livestock workdays. The remaining 26 households needed all or part of their land cultivated, totaling 119 mu of paddy fields and 310 mu of dry land. The amount of land cultivation assistance was determined based on two principles: first, ensuring that the income of military families was sufficient to maintain their livelihood; second, military families should organize their own labor to cultivate as much land as they could, and the rest would be handed over to the mutual aid teams. For those with more land and fewer or no laborers, the amount of land cultivation assistance was calculated based on sufficient income to maintain their livelihood, and the remaining land was cultivated by mutual aid teams, with the military families paying wages. For front-line soldiers without immediate family members, the masses would cultivate part of their land, and the other land would be rented out or lent to others for cultivation. The income, after expenses, would be kept by the village and returned when they returned to establish their families. Based on the above principles and various situations, each household was specifically discussed by mass groups to determine the amount, and then approved by the military families. According to the general situation in the area, each mu of dry land required seven workdays, and each mu of paddy field required 35 workdays, totaling 5515 workdays including labor and animal power. Then, it was discussed who would provide the land cultivation assistance. As a result, it was decided that military families would not provide land cultivation assistance to other military families. Village cadres, except for the village chief who was detached from production, primary school teachers, and communicators, had no land cultivation obligations (because the village was large and the work was busy, the masses suggested that the village chief and communicators should not provide land cultivation assistance). All other village cadres, militia members, and the masses had the same land cultivation obligations, overcoming the unreasonable phenomenon of village cadres and militia members not providing land cultivation assistance in the past, and all burdens being borne by the masses. It was also determined that female laborers would not provide land cultivation assistance, and male laborers aged 19 to 55 were considered full laborers, while those aged 16 to 18 and 56 to 60 were considered half laborers. The calculation was mainly based on age, but each specific laborer was discussed and approved by the masses. Those with illnesses, disabilities, or who were too weak were reduced or exempted from land cultivation obligations. Livestock was divided into three categories based on the situation: full labor, half labor, and one-and-a-half labor. After the calculation, the village totaled 317 full laborers, and each laborer should contribute 18 workdays, cultivating 0.5 mu of paddy field or 2.5 mu of dry land if providing full land cultivation. The allocation method was to try to achieve voluntary participation from both military families and the masses. The specific methods were: (1) According to the number of mu of land cultivated by each laborer, the military families would first choose who they wanted to provide land cultivation assistance. If the military families had no objections, the masses would choose which military family they wanted to provide land cultivation assistance to and which piece of land they were willing to cultivate, for convenience in their own cultivation. (2) The military families managed the land themselves, and the masses provided labor assistance, with the specific time for labor determined according to the season. (3) Military families were willing to entrust relatives, friends, and trusted acquaintances to manage the land on their behalf, and the masses would provide labor assistance to the managers. After the specific allocation of land cultivation based on these principles, some found it inconvenient to divide the land for each person due to the size and natural conditions of the plots, so the masses naturally formed mutual aid teams to jointly take responsibility for land cultivation. If the number of land plots, natural conditions, and labor did not exactly match the number of land cultivation, the allocation would be based on natural conditions, and the village would make up for it in future military service or support. Under the conscious participation of the masses, the masses themselves proposed to establish covenants: (1) Guarantee that no mu of land of military families would be left uncultivated, and military families would be given priority in cultivation, treating it absolutely the same as their own. (2) Unless there was a natural disaster or man-made disaster, or poor cultivation due to fertilization, resulting in reduced yields, they were willing to compensate. The above two items would be discussed and rewarded or compensated by the masses in the autumn, and the military families were even more happy about the covenants. The specific details of what to plant in the field and how much fertilizer to apply were discussed in detail by the military families and the cultivators. Generally, ordinary grain was the standard, and if extra labor-intensive crops were to be planted, the military families would compensate for the labor.

　　邢台长信村代耕办法
    耿其昌　李朴
    邢台县二区长信村是新区，有三百七十二户人家，在耕地问题上过去完全是派差制度，军属有活就找干部，干部就给派差，且因没有很好的进行动员教育工作，以致代耕工作没搞好。
    今春经过一番思想教育，便由群众讨论决定给谁代耕与代耕多少，调查讨论结果，确定给三十九户军属、烈属及残废不能劳动的荣退军人代耕。因为整个劳力的缺乏，同时动员军属也参加劳动，结果计有六户全不要代耕，有四户土地全归自己经营仅需群众帮工一百个，还有三户需帮助牲口工八十个，其余有二十六户全部或一部需要代耕，共水地一一九亩，旱地三一○亩。代耕多少，是依照两个原则而定：第一、保证军属收入足够维持生活；第二、军属自己劳力的组织起来能种多少先留下，其余交给群众。地多人少而又无劳力者，代耕的数目计算收入以够维持生活为准，余下的土地由互助组耕种，军属出工资。前方军人没有直系家属的由群众给代耕一部，其它土地租出或借给别人耕种，收入除负担外，由村中负责保存，将来复员回来建立家务。根据以上原则及各种不同情况，每户都经群众分组具体讨论，确定了数目，而又经过军属同意，按本地一般情况，每亩旱地用工七个，水地用工三十五个，连帮助的人、畜力共折五五一五个工。接着再讨论谁给代耕，结果决定，军属不给军属代耕，村干部除了脱离生产的村长、小学教员、通讯员没有代耕义务（因村子较大工作繁忙，群众提出村长、通讯员不能代耕），其他无论什么村干部及民兵、群众都是一样代耕，克服了过去村干部、民兵都不代耕，全部由群众负担的不合理现象；又确定了妇女劳力不代耕，男劳力年龄在十九岁至五十五岁者是全劳力，十六岁至十八岁和五十六岁至六十岁者为半劳力代耕，主要是以年龄计算；但具体每个劳力均经群众讨论通过，有疾病、残废者或身体太弱者减少或免除代耕义务，牲口按情形分为全劳力、半劳力与个半劳力三种。计算以后，全村共折全劳力三一七个，平均每个劳力应出工十八个，全代耕水地者为五分，全耕旱地者为二亩五分。分配的办法，是尽量做到军属、群众双方自觉自愿。具体办法是：（一）按每个劳力代耕土地的亩数，先由军属自找愿叫谁给代耕。如果军属没有意见，就由群众自己找愿意给那个军属代耕及愿代耕那块地，对自己耕作时方便。（二）军属自己经营，群众帮助工，具体按季节规定用工的时间。（三）军属愿托亲戚朋友知己可靠的代为经营，群众再给经营户出工帮助。根据这种原则将代耕土地具体分配确定后，有的因为地块大小自然条件的关系，不便每人各自分开耕种，群众便自然组成了互助组共同负责代耕。如遇地块与劳力自然条件劳力应代耕数目不能恰相合适，也是依自然条件而分配，将来由村中参战或支差中都要补齐。在群众自觉的情况下，又由群众自己提出订立公约：（一）保证代耕军属土地不荒一亩，先给军属耕种，绝对给自己的一样。（二）除非天灾人祸或施肥关系而确因耕种不好，使产量减少，情愿包赔。以上两条到秋后群众讨论奖励或包赔，军属对订公约更感高兴。关于地里种什么、施肥多少由军属与代耕户具体商量，一般以普通粮食为标准，倘要种特别多误工的庄稼时，军属给补工。
