　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th: TASS reports: The News Bulletin recently published a communication from Ankara stating that although the ruling Republican People's Party exhausted all means in the recent by-elections of the Turkish National Assembly, it was still resisted by the people. According to many Turkish newspapers, no more than 10 to 20 percent of the total number of voters participated in the voting. Even the moderate "Democratic Party" abandoned voting. Turkey's economic difficulties are also increasing. The recent devaluation of the Turkish lira has led to rising prices, while workers' wages have not increased. The main reason for the economic deterioration lies in maintaining a wartime army of nearly one million troops. The Ministry of National Defense has already received more than 92,643,615 lira more in appropriations than last year. The cost of maintaining the gendarmerie, public security bureaus, and the Ministry of the Interior totals 86.4 million lira. The Turkish government is only trying to increase taxes and rely on foreign "aid" to find a way out of these difficulties. Truman's "Aid to Greece and Turkey" bill has encouraged Turkish reactionaries to intensify their political terror against patriotic democrats. Following the destruction of two democratic parties and the closure of progressive newspapers, democratic leaders are being arrested in large numbers. In Ankara, Izmir, Istanbul and other places, American and British military instructors can be seen engaging in open or secret activities. With American "aid," Turkey is intensively expanding and constructing a network of air force bases. Even during the war, Turks, under British command, built more than 100 airports and rebuilt the Alexandria and Izmir naval bases. The "civilian" aviation enterprises established by Britain and the United States in Turkey are equipped with military personnel. Even Turks cannot approach special airports and radio stations used exclusively by Britain and the United States. All these facts fully expose the inside story of American and British "aid" to Turkey for "reconstruction". This has aroused increasing fear among those who wish Turkey to become a truly independent and peace-loving country.

　　土耳其反动派在美国支持下
    大批逮捕民主领袖
    人民放弃投票抵制反动政府
    【新华社陕北九日电】塔斯社讯：消息报顷刊载安哥拉通讯称：最近土耳其国民大会的补缺选举，虽然当政的人民共和党费尽心机，但仍为人民所抵制。据土耳其许多报纸称：参加投票的人未超过选民总数的百分之十至廿连很温和的“民主党”也放弃投票。土耳其的经济困难亦增涨不已，最近土币里拉的贬值引起物价高涨，而工人的工资则并未增加。经济恶化的主要原因，在于仍然维持将近百万兵力的战时军队。今年国防部已收到的拨款，较去年的超过九千二百六十四万三千六百十五里拉，维持宪兵部队及公安局、内政部等的费用，总计达八千六百四十万里拉。土政府仅图增加赋税和仰仗外国的“援助”以为此种困难找寻出路。杜鲁门“援助希土”的法案，鼓励了土耳其反动派加强其反对爱国民主人士的政治恐怖。随着摧残两个民主党派和查封进步报纸而来的，是大批逮捕民主领袖。在安哥拉、伊斯密尔、伊斯坦布尔等地，都可看到美国和英国的军事教官们公开的或秘密的活动。在美国“援助”之下，土耳其正紧张的进行着扩大和建设空军基地网的工作。远在战争期间，土耳其人曾在英国指挥下建筑了一百多个机场，还把亚历山大勒达港与伊斯密尔海军基地加以重建。英美在土耳其所设的“民用”航空事业，却配备着军事人员。单独由英美使用的特别机场与无线电台，即使土耳其人也不能走近它们。所有这些事实完全揭露了美英“援”土“重建”的内幕。这在那些愿望土耳其成为真正独立及爱好和平之国家的人士当中，已引起日益增大的恐惧。
