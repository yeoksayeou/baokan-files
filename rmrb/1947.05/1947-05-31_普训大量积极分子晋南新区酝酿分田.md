　　[This Dispatch from Taiyue, 29th] Land reform is brewing extensively in the newly recovered areas of Jin'nan. After the recovery of the county seat, the Xinjiang County government immediately began training a large number of village cadres and activists, who have now all returned to their villages to organize forces to mobilize the masses. Currently, the third and fourth districts have identified their key points and are brewing struggles. In the first district, 24 cadres and 31 primary school teachers are concentrated in 41 villages to conduct propaganda. In just three days, 245 poor peasants have awakened and demanded land. Some peasants in Xihongqiao, Guojiazhuang, Dongwei Village, Sanjiadian and other villages have begun individual complaints. The Jiang County Village Cadre Training Class has also ended, and the first and fourth districts are holding activist meetings to study methods of igniting the movement. The Jilu County Village Cadre Training Class has completed three sessions, and 35 administrative villages have successively convened "reverse reckoning" investigation meetings to investigate the situation of peasants being "reverse reckoned" by landlords last year, in order to launch a broad struggle. Their slogan is "Settle old and new accounts together."

　　普训大量积极分子晋南新区酝酿分田
    【本报太岳二十九日电】晋南新收复区普遍酝酿土地改革。新绛县政府在县城收复后即开始大量训练村干部与积极分子，现已全部回村组织力量进行发动。目前三、四两区已确定基点，正酝酿斗争，一区四十一个村庄集中二十四位干部与三十一位小学教员进行宣传，只三天时间已有二百四十五个贫苦农民觉醒要求土地。西横桥、郭家庄、东尉村、三家店等村已有部分农民开始个别诉苦。绛县村干部训练班也已结束，一、四区正召开积极分子会议，研究点火办法。稷麓县村干部训练班已办完三期，现已有三十五个行政村先后召开被“倒算”调查会，调查该县去年农民被地主“倒算”情形，以便发动广泛斗争，他们的口号是“新旧账一齐算”。
