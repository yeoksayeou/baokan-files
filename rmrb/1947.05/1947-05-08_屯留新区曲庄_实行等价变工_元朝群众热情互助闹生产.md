    Tunliu New District Qu Village
    Implements Equivalent Exchange of Labor
    Yuan Dynasty Masses Enthusiastically Help Each Other in Production
    [Our Newspaper Taiyue 6th Dispatch] When Qu Village, Tunliu New District, began plowing this spring, there was only one mutual aid team for sideline production led by Liu Yuxia, consisting of a dozen people. Seeing that all the villages had already started spring plowing, Liu Yuxia wanted to make a breakthrough from his own team and organize the masses of the whole village for production. At that time, a meeting of team members and neighbors was held, but everyone was silent. Liu Yuxia thought that it was probably because the agricultural labor exchange last year was unreasonable, and those with livestock suffered losses. Therefore, he mobilized everyone and said, "Our mutual aid this year must truly be democratic and cannot be forced like last year. I guarantee that the recording of work points and distribution will be fair and just." Then everyone responded, "Then it is best to set a rule." As a result, the following was decided: (1) Labor is temporarily worth six liters of rice per day, and later it will be rated according to the strength of the labor force. (2) Livestock, regardless of fodder, plowing one mu of land is worth one work point, and the person holding the plow gets one work point per day in addition to food. (3) Mutual aid teams can join and withdraw voluntarily. Only then was everyone relieved, and immediately forty people signed up to participate in mutual aid, accounting for one-third of the full and semi-labor force in the whole village. Li Zaiyou and Liu Yuxia were elected as the captain and vice-captain, and the next day they began to deliver manure and build embankments.

　　屯留新区曲庄
    实行等价变工
    元朝群众热情互助闹生产
    【本报太岳六日电】屯留新区曲庄今春开始耕地时，只有刘玉夏一个十余人的副业生产互助组，眼看各村都已开始春耕了，刘玉夏便想从自己的小组突破，组织全村群众生产，当时召开了组员与邻居会议，但大家都不吭气，刘玉夏心想大概是因为去年农业变工不合理，有牲口的人吃了亏，于是便动员大家说：“咱们今年的互助要真正讲民主，可不能像去年那样强迫，我保证记工订分公公道道”。接着大家应声说：“那么顶好定下个规矩。”结果定出：（一）人工暂时一天六升米，以后再按劳力强弱评分。（二）牲口不管草料犁一亩地顶一工，掌犁的人除管饭外一天顶一工。（三）互助组自愿参加自愿退出。如此大家才放心了，立刻报名参加互助的达四十人，占全村全半劳力三分之一，选出李在右及刘玉夏为正副队长，第二日即开始送粪、垒＠。
