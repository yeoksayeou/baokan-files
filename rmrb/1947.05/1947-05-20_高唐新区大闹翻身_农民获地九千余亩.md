　　Great Turnaround in Gaotang New District
　　Peasants Obtain Over 9,000 Mu of Land
　　[This dispatch from our Jinnan office, dated the 18th] Since early April, the masses in the newly liberated Gaotang Seventh District, after more than twenty days of storm-like struggle, have overthrown 120 stubborn landlords and local bullies, recovering 9,555 mu of land, 62,403 jin of grain, 9,205 jin of cotton, 2.05 million Jichaobi (border region currency), 23 carts, 44 head of livestock, 12 cotton gins, and other houses, trees, and utensils have not yet been counted. Forty-two villages have established peasant associations with over 2,600 members, and 300 young adults have organized "turnaround armed guard teams," to both suppress feudal counterattacks with guns and continue to brew struggle. Currently, in the spirit of "not missing the agricultural season," the villages are rushing to measure and distribute land, with some villages already having completed the distribution and entering spring plowing and planting. In Huangzhuang, Fifth District of Pingyuan, the landlord Huang, the "Licentiate," cultivated two qing of land and sold one hundred mu to local Chiang Kai-shek stubborn elements Shi Guangshan and Li Wenzun, while the remaining one hundred mu was entirely cultivated by poor peasants for over ten years without any compensation. Relying on his grandson being an official in the Kuomintang, the villagers had to consult him on even minor matters, and they had to give him gifts during festivals and holidays. In famine years, he embezzled relief grain. The local tyrant Cao Baotian of Chenzhuang, whose brother was the captain of the puppet bandit in the Huangzhuang stronghold, extorted heavily, forcing many peasants to leave for Guanwai (Northeast China). In the spring, his livestock would freely eat other people's wheat seedlings, and when lending 100 jin of millet, he would demand 100 jin of wheat in return. After the turnaround team went to the countryside, the peasants of these two villages united to struggle against the Cao and Huang families, recovering farm tools, furniture, clothing, etc., worth 630,000 yuan, 420 mu of land, and 28 rooms. The land and movable property were divided into three grades and nine ranks, with each person's share brought up to more than four mu of land, completely eliminating poor peasants.

　　高唐新区大闹翻身
    农民获地九千余亩
    【本报冀南十八日电】新解放的高唐七区群众自四月初经二十多天暴风雨式的斗争，已斗倒封顽地主恶霸一百二十人，收回土地九五五五亩、粮食六二四○三斤、棉花九二零五斤、冀钞二零五万元，大车二十三辆、牲口四四头、轧花车十二架，其他房屋、树木、用具尚未统计。四十二个村建立了农会，会员有两千六百余名，三百名青壮年组织起“翻身武装保卫队”，一面拿枪镇压封建反攻，一面继续酝酿斗争。现各村在“不误农时”的精神下，正突击丈量、分地，有的村已经分完，进入春耕播种。平原五区黄庄地主黄“举人”种两顷地，卖给土著蒋顽头子史广山、李文樽一百亩，下余百亩全由贫苦农民来耕种，十多年不再负担。仗着孙儿子在国民党做官，村里人小事也得和他商量，每逢过节时要群众给他送礼，灾荒年私吞救济粮。陈庄恶霸曹保田，其弟在黄庄据点当伪匪队长，横征暴敛，逼得很多农民下了关外（东北）。春天喂牲口随便吃别人的麦苗，借出百斤谷子要收回百斤麦子。翻身队下乡后，该二村农民联合起来，对曹家黄家进行了斗争，共收回农具、家具、衣服等折价六十三万元，土地四百二十亩，房二十八间。土地、浮财按三等九级分，每人填平到四亩地以上，贫农完全消灭。
