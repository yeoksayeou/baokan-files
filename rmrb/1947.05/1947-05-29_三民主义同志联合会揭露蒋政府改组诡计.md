Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 27th: Shanghai dispatch: The Sanmin Zhuyi Comrades Association issued a declaration on the current situation at the beginning of this month, stating: (1) Unite with non-Party democratic parties to strive for domestic peace, democracy, unity, and unification, and wholeheartedly support resolving the China issue through the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) method. (2) Unite with democratic groups and democratic elements within the Kuomintang to restore Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary line. The declaration further pointed out: The role of the Chiang government's reorganization is to use the Political Science Clique as the leader, with the participation of the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party, to feign democracy. It is indeed a continuation of the personal dictatorship government, which will continue to expand the civil war nationwide, deceive the United States to strengthen American interference in internal affairs, and its consequences will inevitably help the Political Science Clique realize its conspiracy to seize power, accelerate the disintegration of the Kuomintang, promote the collapse of the entire society, and completely lead China into a colonial process. Finally, the association called on all countries in the world not to be deceived by the Chiang government's reorganization. In particular, the United States must correct its erroneous actions such as providing loans and weapons. It hoped that domestic democratic parties and progressive elements within the Kuomintang would strengthen unity, oppose the civil war, and called on those within the Kuomintang who possess military and political power to rapidly withdraw from the civil war.
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th: Shanghai dispatch: Luo Longji, spokesperson for the Democratic League, recently issued a statement denying that the Democratic League is willing to participate in the general election in the Chiang-controlled areas. He also stated: The Democratic League's most pressing concern at the moment is the safety of its members.

　　三民主义同志联合会揭露蒋政府改组诡计
    【新华社华中二十七日电】沪讯：三民主义同志联合会于本月初发表对时局宣言称：（一）联合党外民主党派，争取国内的和平民主团结统一，并竭诚拥护用政协方式解决中国问题。（二）联合国民党内的民主团体和民主分子，恢复孙中山的革命路线。该宣言继指出：蒋政府改组之作用，是在于以政学系为首，民青两党参加之姿态来伪装民主，确系个人独裁政府之延续，使全国内战继续扩大，欺骗美国来加强美国干涉内政，其后果必将助成政学系掠夺政权之阴谋实现，而加速国民党的分化，促进整个社会的崩溃，使中国完全步入殖民地的过程。最后该会呼吁世界各国勿受蒋政府改组之欺骗，尤其美国必须纠正贷款助械等错误行动，希望国内各民主党派及国民党内进步分子加紧团结，反对内战，并呼吁国民党内拥有军权、政权分子，急速退出内战。
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】沪息：民盟发言人罗隆基日前发表声明，否认民盟愿参加蒋区之普选。并称：民盟目下所最关切者，为民盟会员之安全。
