Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: Comprehensive reports: The United Nations Special Assembly concluded on the 15th, lasting 18 days. The outcome was the establishment of a Palestine investigation committee composed of 11 countries. However, the proceedings fully exposed the faces of US and British imperialism, colluding with each other to hinder the Palestinian national independence movement. On the other hand, the expressions of dissatisfaction from various Arab countries after the meeting demonstrate that the Palestinian independence movement will continue to develop. The repeated speeches of the Soviet representative at this conference once again prove that only the Soviet Union, which genuinely aids small and weak nations, is a friend of those striving for Palestinian national independence.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: According to a United Press report from Chenggong Lake: After the conclusion of the United Nations Special Assembly, various Arab countries expressed great dissatisfaction with the meeting. Because of the manipulation by the US and Britain, the assembly neither discussed the issue of granting immediate independence to Palestine, nor did it decide to include investigation of matters related to Palestinian independence within the scope of work of the Palestine investigation committee. Therefore, responsible individuals from Arab countries and the Arab Higher Committee held meetings on the 17th and 18th to decide whether to boycott the Palestine investigation committee. After the meeting on the 17th, a representative stated: The Arab Higher Committee may refuse to attend the investigation committee; several representatives of Arab countries may suggest to their own countries that they refuse to cooperate in the investigation work of the committee.

　　美英阻挠巴勒斯坦独立
    阿剌伯国家齐反对
    【新华社陕北十九日电】综合报导：联合国特别大会已于十五日闭会，此次会议共十八天，结果是成立了一个由十一国组成的巴勒斯坦调查委员会。不过，在会议的进程中都充分暴露了美英帝国主义的面目，他们相互勾结以阻碍巴勒斯坦的民族独立运动。另一方面从各阿拉伯国家会后的不满表示，显示出巴勒斯坦的独立运动仍将继续发展。苏联代表在此次会议中之屡次发言，又一次证明只有真正援助弱小民族的苏联，才是巴勒斯坦民族独立运动者的朋友。
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】据合众社成功湖讯：联合国特别大会结束后，各阿拉伯国家对该会甚表不满；因为由于美英的操纵，大会上既没有讨论立即给予巴勒斯坦独立的问题，又未决定在巴勒斯坦调查委员会的工作范围中、包括调查有关巴勒斯坦独立之事项。因此，阿拉伯各国及阿拉伯高级委员会之负责人士曾于十七、十八两日举行会议以决定是否抵制巴勒斯坦调查委员会。十七日会后，某代表称：阿拉伯高级委员会或将拒绝出席调查委员会；若干阿拉伯国家代表，可能向本国建议彼等将拒绝在委员会之调查工作中保持合作。
