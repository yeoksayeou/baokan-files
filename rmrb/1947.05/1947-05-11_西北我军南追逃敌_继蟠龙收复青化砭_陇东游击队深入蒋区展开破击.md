　　Xinhua News Agency, Shaanbei Front, May 9th: Following the recovery of Panlong, a unit of the Northwest People's Liberation Army continued its attack on Qinghuabian, an important fortified stronghold of Hu Zongnan's forces 70 li north of Yan'an, on the 5th. The two regiments of Hu Zongnan's army (one regiment each from the 84th Brigade and the 48th Brigade) and local security forces stationed there fled in panic towards Yan'an upon hearing the news. The People's Liberation Army immediately recovered Qinghuabian on the 5th, and the captured ammunition, flour, etc. are currently being inventoried.
    Xinhua News Agency, Shaanbei, May 9th: Investigations into the Battle of liberating Yaoxian have now revealed that the annihilated Hu Zongnan forces also included the headquarters of the 85th Brigade of the 10th Division, and the headquarters of the Third Regiment of the Shaanbei Security Corps. Over a thousand Chiang Kai-shek (Zhong Zheng Shi) rifles were captured, and the ammunition alone requires 500 pack animals to transport.
    Xinhua News Agency, Shaanbei Front, May 9th: When Chiang Kai-shek's planes were providing cover for the fleeing Hu Zongnan troops from Qinghuabian on the afternoon of the 6th, one of Chiang Kai-shek's planes was hit by the People's Liberation Army over the northwestern mountains of Guaimao, and immediately crashed in an area more than 20 li north of Yan'an. This is the fifth Chiang Kai-shek plane shot down by the Northwest People's Liberation Army.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, May 9th: Mass rallies have been held in various parts of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region to celebrate the great victory at Panlong and the liberation of Yaoxian. On the evening of May 7th, a celebration rally was held by people from all walks of life in the Party, government, military, and civilian sectors of the Border Region in a certain area of northern Shaanxi. Comrade Ma Mingfang, Deputy Secretary of the Northwest Bureau, Deputy Commander Wang Weizhou of the Joint Defense Headquarters, and Comrade Jia Tuofu spoke successively, pointing out that the great victory at Panlong once again proves that the soldiers and civilians of the Border Region can rely on their own strength to completely eliminate Hu Zongnan's invading forces in the Border Region. However, this is only the beginning of victory. The soldiers and civilians of the entire Border Region should not be arrogant in victory, overcome the idea of ​​a quick victory, and plan everything from a long-term perspective. The frontline troops must fight more bravely and tenaciously, and the rear must further strengthen war support and production work to strive for the early arrival of victory.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, May 9th: People in Qingyang, Heshui, Zhenyuan and other places in Longdong, Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, have taken up arms to resist the invading Chiang Kai-shek's and Hu Zongnan’s troops. In March, the number of guerrilla fighters in the area increased by one and a half times compared with February, and the flames of guerrilla warfare have been ignited in the KMT-occupied areas. A guerrilla team in Zhenyuan captured three puppet Bao chiefs and secret agents outside the town of Mengyao, and cut dozens of miles of telephone lines in the Dashizi area of ​​Laozhenyuan, with all the telephone poles along the line sawn into three sections. Proclamations from the democratic government have appeared near Zhenyuan City. On the night of the 10th of last month, a guerrilla team penetrated deep into the Liqukou area of ​​the KMT-controlled area, burning down seven enemy barracks and six bunkers. The guerrilla group in the fifth village of the third district of the county fought while distributing land, repelling two enemy harassments, and the peasants' struggle mood has greatly increased. A guerrilla team in Qingyang City repelled the enemy's attacks on Baimapu and Guojiayaoxian several times, and the guerrilla team in the area repelled a battalion of enemy troops who came to Baimapu to loot grain. They also mobilized the masses to transfer grain. In mid-March, the county's working team penetrated deep into the enemy-occupied area of ​​Gaojiasi and destroyed more than 220 enemy telephone poles. At the end of February, when the enemy attacked Heshui, the guerrillas of the fifth district persisted in the local struggle and protected the masses to continue land reform work. The guerrillas in the second district cooperated with the Huachi guerrillas to completely destroy the enemy fortifications in Wangningpu.
