　　Qingfeng Dazhang Village Forms Production Team
    Distributing Harvests Without Delaying Sowing
    [Report from this newspaper's Ji-Lu-Yu correspondent, 9th] Dazhang Village, Sixth District of Qingfeng, is carrying out spring plowing in conjunction with land reform and war support. Before the village had finished distributing the harvest, dozens more villagers left to support the war effort. Recently, after a rainfall, the masses demanded that the land be harrowed and sown as quickly as possible. Therefore, the cadres called a meeting of all the villagers to discuss solutions. On the one hand, mutual aid teams were organized to carry out spring plowing; on the other hand, an evaluation committee was selected to be responsible for distributing the harvest. Production mutual aid was carried out by more than sixty young people organized into a production brigade, divided into three detachments. Nine squads, with seven people in each squad, were led by production hero Wang Ziliang to weed the wheat. In addition, forty-five head of livestock were organized to haul manure and plow the land. More than forty elderly people and children with partial labor capacity also voluntarily reported to be organized to manage livestock hauling manure and plowing the land. Women organized eighteen groups to grind flour at home in mutual aid, ensuring that livestock production was not delayed. The next day after the meeting, action was taken. Spring plowing began with the poor, the families of soldiers, and those supporting the war effort. In six days, all the land in the village was weeded, a total of more than fifteen *qing* of wheat land were weeded, one unit of manure was hauled, and all the cotton fields were plowed.

　　清丰大张庄组成生产队
    分果实不误下种
    【本报冀鲁豫九日电】清丰六区大张庄结合土地改革、战勤，进行春耕。该庄果实还没分完，村里又有几十人出战勤。目前下了一场雨，群众要求赶快耙地下种，于是干部就召集全村群众开会商讨办法。一面组织互助组，进行春耕；一面选出评议委员会，负责分配果实。生产互助是由六十多个青年组织生产大队，下分三个分队。九个班，每班七人，由生产英雄王字良领导锄麦；另外又组织了四十五头牲口，进行拉粪、犁地。老汉、儿童半劳力四十余人，也自动报告组织起来，管牲口拉粪、犁地。妇女组织十八组，在家互助推磨，保证不耽误牲口生产。会后第二天就行动起来；春耕先从贫苦的军属和出战勤的开始，六天就把全村的地锄完，共锄麦地十五顷多，粪拉了一部，棉花地亦全部犁完。
