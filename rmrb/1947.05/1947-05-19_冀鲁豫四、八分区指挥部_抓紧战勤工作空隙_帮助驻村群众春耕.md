The Headquarters of the 4th and 8th Military Sub-districts of Hebei-Shandong-Henan
Seize Gaps in War Preparations
Help Villagers Stationed in the Area with Spring Planting

[This newspaper's Hebei-Shandong-Henan dispatch, 17th] Various organs and groups in Hebei-Shandong-Henan are helping the masses with spring planting. The headquarters of the 8th Military Sub-district seized the gaps in war preparations to help the villagers stationed in the area with spring planting. Because the village had been ravaged by Chiang's troops, very few livestock remained. Even now, a lot of manure has not been delivered to the fields, and much of the spring land has not been plowed or harrowed. The headquarters actively organized manpower, from the commissioner down to the orderlies and the militiamen who had not yet set out, to push manure for the masses. On April 28th alone, they delivered more than a hundred cartloads of manure. The militiamen had just arrived at the headquarters and had to leave for a distant expedition three days later, but they still helped the masses plow 30 mu of land. The militiamen, in every war gap, helped the masses with spring planting, gathering firewood, and chopping grass. According to a week's statistics from one company alone, they pushed 91 cartloads of manure and gathered 1,600 jin of firewood. The Guancheng Fourth District stretcher team actively helped the masses with spring planting in the war gaps, and organized all the carpenters and plasterers in the stretcher team to build walls, weave cattle cages, and make bellows for the masses, so that the masses could free up more time for cultivating the land. The headquarters of the 4th Military Sub-district organized personnel from various units into production groups, equipped with their own livestock and carts, to help cultivate the land of military families, worker families, and those without labor. In just three days, they plowed 50 mu of land, harrowed 30 mu of land, and hauled more than 30 cartloads of manure. The Second Branch Bureau of Public Security organized self-reformers to help the masses with production, with guards team fighters serving as production team leaders. Within ten days, they cultivated 150 mu of land, solving the spring planting difficulties of military and worker families and those without labor. The Administrative Office of the Administrative Office launched a competition to help the masses with spring planting, combining the movement to select models and establish merit. The office's staff who stayed at home were only ten people, with three heads of livestock from the agency, and they plowed 39 mu of land in six afternoons.
