　　[This newspaper's Jinan, Hebei dispatch, 6th] Since Yuan Dynasty County determined in March to focus on the production movement and issued the call to "strengthen agriculture, develop sideline industries, and strive to achieve the goal of 'cultivating three and having a surplus of one'," it first clarified among cadres the ideas of "not only leading the masses to thoroughly liberate themselves, but also leading the masses to settle down and get rich," "adding effort upon effort," and "developing production to lay a material foundation for winning the patriotic self-defense war." Then, it called on liberated farmers to get rich and organized large-scale production. In April, of the 73 households in Yujia Village, all except a few who were struggled against participated in mutual aid; of the 198 households in Songyao Village, 140 households participated in mutual aid. In Dongdushi Village, there were 21 mutual aid groups, and all the land had been plowed and harrowed. In the Seventh District, 768 mu of wasteland were reclaimed in four days. After planting sorghum, they launched a concentrated effort to build manure pits. In the Huazhuang sub-district, four villages added 41 new manure pits. Two blacksmiths in Xiaohu Village made eight ploughshares per day, solving the ploughshare problem for villages within a 25-li radius. The two of them earned 400,000 yuan in 25 days. Liu Hanqing bought ten mu of land with the money he earned carrying firewood. The mutual aid group in Songyao Village opened a vermicelli factory and extracted salt, making a profit of 50,000 yuan per day. Taking advantage of the break from spring plowing, the county decided to launch a concentrated effort to dig and repair the Majia River in early May to increase irrigation.
