Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 18th: An authoritative military commentator in East China recently commented on the great victory of the East China People's Liberation Army at Menglianggu, stating that the Menglianggu campaign has significant implications for the overall national situation, particularly the East China situation. (1) In this battle, after two days and three nights of fierce fighting, the entire 74th Division of Chiang Kai-shek's army and one regiment of the 83rd Division were completely annihilated, dealing Chiang Kai-shek the most painful blow. The 74th Division was one of Chiang Kai-shek's five main forces, his main capital for fighting the civil war, the "Imperial Guard" of the Chiang devil, the Nanjing garrison, and had undergone special training by the American advisory group, being fully equipped with American weaponry. Since August of last year, when this division was transferred out of Nanjing as the main force for invading the East China Liberated Area, it had been repeatedly "commended" by Chiang Kai-shek, becoming extremely arrogant and boastful, claiming "with the 74th Division, there is the Kuomintang." Li Yannian also boasted in Huaiyin, "with ten 74th Divisions, all of China can be unified." Recalling last March when Wang Yaowu met General Chen Yi in Jinan, he said that only the 74th Division in Chiang's army could fight, having been cultivated by Wang with painstaking effort and personally. However, such an "amazing" 74th Division could not avoid the tragic end of being completely wiped out. Now, can Chiang Kai-shek not weep for the demise of his "Imperial Guard"? Can the American reactionaries not be shocked by it? As for Wang Yaowu, who relied on the 74th Division and the 73rd Army (which was already annihilated in the Laiwu Campaign) to get promoted and make a fortune, his grief and sorrow are self-evident. In short, the annihilation of Chiang's direct line, first-class main force, the 74th Division, is a great gain and contribution of the People's Liberation Army. (2) In view of the repeated defeats of dividing forces to attack the Liberated Areas, Chiang Kai-shek changed to concentrating his forces, implementing a "center-of-gravity tactic," a "key offensive," and launching a major offensive against the Shandong Liberated Area. Chiang Kai-shek and Chen Cheng used one-half of their total forces attacking the Liberated Areas, along with their elite main forces and "excellent" troops, such as the 5th Army (original designation), 74th Division, 11th Division, 7th Division, 72nd Division (which was already annihilated in the Tai'an Campaign), 9th Division, etc., to invade the Shandong Liberated Area. At the same time, they exhausted their resources, blocked the Yellow River at Huayuankou, diverted the water to its old course, plotting to flood millions of people in the war zone, and cut off the connection between the East China and Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Liberated Areas, besieging the main force of the East China People's Liberation Army in the Yimeng Mountains and the coastal areas, seeking a "decisive battle" with our main force "to end the war in Shandong," attempting to frighten and deceive some naive people, and to boost the morale of his repeatedly defeated troops and salvage his increasingly serious crisis. However, in the face of the powerful people's army, this attempt has begun to fail. The annihilation of the 74th Division and the 72nd Division is clear evidence. If Chiang Kai-shek, Chen Cheng, Gu Zhutong and their ilk continue to let their troops wander around in the East China Liberated Area, they will continue to be annihilated by the People's Liberation Army batch by batch. Chiang Kai-shek's new strategy, which he relies on to save himself, the so-called "key offensive," will continue to be smashed to pieces. (3) The victory of the Menglianggu campaign marks the beginning of the transformation of the Shandong war situation. The enemy will be forced to stop its reckless offensive, and the enemy will turn to being on the defensive. The People's Liberation Army will begin to seize the initiative of the war from then on, and with perseverance, follow the arduous path to gradually annihilate the enemy and strive for the arrival of a full-scale counter-offensive. This victory is also in coordination with the vigorously developing victorious offensives in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan, Northeast and other battlefields, forming the beginning of a major counter-offensive in the overall national war situation.

### 华东军事评论家论此次大捷  蒋军“重点进攻”开始  破产对全国战局也有重大意义

　　华东军事评论家论此次大捷
    蒋军“重点进攻”开始  破产对全国战局也有重大意义
    【新华社华东前线十八日电】华东权威军事评论家顷就华东人民解放军孟良崮大捷发表评论称：孟良崮府战，对全国战局，特别是华东战局有重大意义。（一）此次经两天三夜激战，干脆彻底歼灭蒋军七十四师全部及八十三师一个团，给了蒋介石以最惨痛的打击。七十师为蒋介石五大主力之一，是他打内战的主要资本，是蒋魔王的“御林军”，南京卫戍部队，而且经过美国顾问团特种训练，改装为全部美械。自去年八月，该师调出南京作为进犯华东解放区之主力后，屡次为蒋介石传令“嘉奖”，被“奖”得神气十足，骄傲无比，自吹“有七十四师就有国民党”，李延年也曾在淮阴大吹“有十个七十四师就可以统一全中国”。回忆去年三月王耀武在济南会见陈毅将军时，曾谓蒋军中只有第七十四师能战，是王苦心孤诣并亲自培养出来的。可是，这样“了不起”的七十四师，也免不了全师覆灭的悲惨结局。现在，蒋介石能不为其“御林军”之覆灭而痛哭吗？美国反动派能不为之震惊吗？至于依赖七十四师及七十三军（按该军已于莱芜战役就歼）而升官发财的王耀武，其伤心哀愁，更是不言而喻。总之，蒋嫡系第一等主力七十四师的就歼，这是人民解放军的伟大收获与贡献。（二）蒋介石鉴于分路进攻解放区之屡次复败，乃改取集中兵力，实行“重心战术”，“重点进攻”，大举进攻山东解放区。蒋介石、陈诚以其进攻解放区总兵力的二分之一，并以其精锐主力及“优秀”部队，如第五军（原番号）、七十四师、十一师、第七师、七十二师（按该师已于泰安战役就歼）、第九师等，向山东解放区进犯。同时粮穷力竭，堵死黄河花园口，放水归故，阴谋水淹战道千百万人民，并隔断华东、晋冀鲁豫两大解放区的联系，围困华东人民解放军主力于沂蒙山区及海边，寻求与我主力“决战”，以结束山东境内的战事”，企图吓唬和蒙混一下某些幼稚人士，并替他屡败的部队打气、挽救其日益严重的危机。可是，在强大的人民军队面前，这一企图已开始破产。七十四师、七十二师的就歼即是明证。蒋介石、陈诚、顾祝同辈，如果仍把他的部队放在华东解放区徘徊乱窜，必将继续被人民解放军一批一批的歼灭掉。蒋介石妄图赖以自救的新战略，所谓“重点进攻”，必将继续被打得粉碎。（三）孟良崮之战的胜利，标志着山东战局的开始转变，敌人将被迫停止其冒险进攻，敌人将转而处于被动，人民解放军就从此开始夺得战争主动权，并以坚忍的毅力循着艰巨的道路逐次歼灭敌人，争取全面反攻的到来。此次胜利也是配合陕北、晋冀鲁豫、东北等战场蓬勃发展的胜利攻势，形成全国战局大举反攻的开始。
