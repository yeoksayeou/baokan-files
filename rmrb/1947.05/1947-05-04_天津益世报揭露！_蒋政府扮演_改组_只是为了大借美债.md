Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd. Tianjin Yishibao, in its editorial on the 13th of last month, referred to the ugly farce of the Jiang government's reorganization, directed by U.S. imperialism, as "the formal significance seems to outweigh the substantive significance." It also revealed that the purpose of the U.S.-Jiang master-slave duo's performance of "reorganization" was to obtain a five-hundred-million-dollar loan. The editorial referred to the so-called participation of the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party in the government as a "timely coincidence," and said that the general public's impression of the Democratic Socialist and Youth parties was "really very faint," and that "the people dare not believe that they are representatives of the people." The editorial concluded: "Although accommodating the Democratic Socialist and Youth parties to participate in the government (referring to the Jiang government) can be used as a gesture of political reform, this mere gesture will not help the reality." (Note: Yishibao is a newspaper run by the Catholic Church and has always been very close to the Jiang government. Now that it is also making such comments, it can be seen what the general public in the Jiang area thinks of Chiang Kai-shek's "reorganized government.")

　　天津益世报揭露！
    蒋政府扮演“改组”只是为了大借美债
    【新华社陕北二日电】天津益世报在上月十三日社论中对美帝国主义导演的蒋政府改组丑剧，称之为“形式的意义似乎多过于实质的意义”。并揭露美蒋主奴扮演“改组”的目的，是为了五亿美元的贷款。该社论对民社党、青年党的所谓参加政府，称之为“时会因缘”，并说一般人民对民青两党的印象，“实在非常淡漠”，“人民不敢相信他们是人民的代表。”社论最后称：“容纳民青两党参加政府（指蒋政府），虽然可做为政治改革的一种姿态，但仅仅这种姿态必无补于实际”。（按：益世报为天主教所办报纸，素极接近蒋政府，现亦作如此评论，于此可见蒋区一般人士对蒋介石之“改组政府”看法如何。）
