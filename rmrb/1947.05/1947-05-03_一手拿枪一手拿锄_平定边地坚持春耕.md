Holding a Gun in One Hand and a Hoe in the Other
    Pacifying Border Areas and Persisting in Spring Plowing
    [This Dispatch from Taihang, One Day] The first district of Pingding is implementing a combination of labor and military affairs, organizing spring plowing in uninhabited areas and border areas, and has gained preliminary experience. The district has twenty-four administrative villages, five of which are uninhabited, and twelve are border areas close to uninhabited areas. The uninhabited areas were created during the Yan puppet's offensive last winter, and most of the masses have been transferred to the rear old areas. Now that spring plowing has arrived, the masses are demanding production. However, they also have concerns, thinking that being close to the enemy's blockhouse means that going back to produce is like "the chicken visiting the weasel for the New Year," which is too dangerous, and that as long as they don't starve to death in the rear, it's fine. In response to this thinking, the leadership organized discussions among cadres, heroes, and others. Li Mutou, chairman of the Farmers' Association, said: "Land is fundamental, and food is the lifeline. If we can't plant the land, it won't work! We should not be afraid of difficulties and unite to defend spring plowing." After this idea was clarified, specific methods were studied: First, rectify the armed forces. Replenish ammunition, organize a strong armed production brigade, each person taking a suitable farm tool and a weapon, light luggage, establish temporary residence, guerrilla production, when the enemy goes east, we go west, when the enemy advances, we fight to the enemy's rear, under the unified leadership of the combat production headquarters. Second, unify the use of labor to cultivate the land. Those with labor but no land and those with land but no labor voluntarily combine and share the grain. The land of fugitive households is the responsibility of the village and is temporarily lent to those without land to cultivate. To facilitate management, plant more provincial work crops. Third, women, the elderly, and the weak stay in the rear to engage in sideline production. In the villages in the border areas, the experience of each village was also studied to clarify the understanding: First, the key to grasping the combination of labor and military affairs is how to organize the armed forces, use them in favorable terrain, control key points, and exert strength. Second, the organizational form of the combination of labor and military affairs varies according to the conditions of each village, but the principle of equal pay for equal work should be grasped. There are three forms in the district: One is Gutou Village, which is at the focus of the struggle against the enemy, and the enemy comes almost every five days. The village's method is: organize the entire village's labor and military forces, cadres divide their work to lead, the director of the Armed Committee leads the militia to control key points for cover, and the deputy village chief leads the masses to rush to cultivate the land in the rear. One is Guandaogou Village, which organizes all the full labor force and auxiliary labor force in the village and implements subscriptions. Every day, two scouts are sent to inquire about the situation, a cadre is on duty in the village to grasp the situation and handle daily affairs, and a squad of armed forces is drawn to produce in the front near the enemy, and when they find the situation, they go to the mountain for cover. One is Ning'ai Village, which first voluntarily establishes mutual aid teams, and then each group draws militia to form armed forces, dividing shifts to cover the masses' production. Third, the combination of labor and military affairs is not just the militia fighting and the masses producing. The militia should use the gaps in combat to engage in production, and the general masses should also have the idea of ​​universal armament, squeezing out time to build stone mines, prepare ammunition and various things used in the war, so as to better exert the strength of labor and military affairs.

### 一手拿枪一手拿锄  平定边地坚持春耕

　　一手拿枪一手拿锄
    平定边地坚持春耕
    【本报太行一日电】平定一区实行劳武结合、组织无人区与边沿区春耕，已获初步经验。该区二十四个行政村，无人区有五个村，靠近无人区的边沿区有十二个村。无人区是去冬阎伪进攻时造成的，群众大部转移到后方老区，现在春耕到来，群众要求生产。但思想又有顾虑，以为离敌人炮楼近，回去生产就好比“鸡给黄鼠狼拜年”太危险，只要在后方饿不死就行，针对这种思想，领导上就组织干部英雄等讨论。黎木头农会主席说：“土地是基本，粮食是命根，种不上地，可不行哩！我们应该不怕困难，团结起来保卫春耕。”这一思想明确后，就研究具体做法：一、整顿武装。补充弹药，组织强有力的武装生产大队，每人拿一件适用的农具和一件武器，轻装行李，建立临时住所，游击生产，敌人到东，我们到西，敌人前进，则打到敌后去，由战斗生产指挥部统一领导。二、统一使用劳力，耕种土地，有劳力没地的与有地没劳力的自愿结合，伙种分粮。逃亡户的地由村负责，暂借给没地的人种。为了便于看管，多种省工作物。三、妇女老弱，留在后方，进行副业生产。在边沿区的村庄，亦研究了各村的经验，明确认识：一、劳武结合应掌握的重点是如何组织武装，使用于有利地形，控制要点，发挥力量。二、劳武结合的组织形式因各村条件而不同，但应掌握一个等价还工的原则。在该区现有三种形式：一种是谷头村，处在对敌斗争的焦点，差不多平均五天敌人就得来一次。该村办法是：组织全村劳武力量，干部分工领导，由武委会主任带领民兵控制要点作掩护，副村长带领群众在后方突击耕地。一种是官道沟村，把全村全劳力与辅助劳力都组织起来，实行订分。每天派两个侦察员打听情况，村内由一个干部值班掌握情况，并处理日常事务，抽一个班武装到靠近敌人的前边生产，发现情况，即上山掩护。一种是宁艾村，先自愿成立互助组，再由各组抽出民兵，组成武装，分班掩护群众生产。三、劳武结合不是民兵光打仗，群众光生产，民兵应该利用战斗空隙进行生产，一般群众亦应该有全民武装的思想，挤出时间打造石雷，准备弹药及战争所用的各种东西，这样才能更大的发挥劳武的力量。
