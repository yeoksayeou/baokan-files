　　Experience in Increasing Livestock
　　Farmers in 42 Villages in Taihang
　　Increase Livestock by 2,000 Head
　　[This newspaper's Taihang dispatch on the 29th] After gaining land, the emancipated farmers in various parts of Taihang have been increasing livestock by various means to overcome the difficulties of labor and animal power. According to preliminary statistics from 42 villages in 10 counties including Changzhi, Changshi, Huguan, Lucheng, Xiyang, Heshun, Licheng, Shexian, Zanhuang, and Yushe, more than 2,100 mules, donkeys, and cattle have been newly added since the beginning of spring. More than ten villages, including Licheng's Licun Gou, Huguan's Baichi, and Heshun's Nuanyao, have exceeded the number of livestock before the war. Before liberation, Changzhi's Nantianhe, Xiguxian, and other four villages had only 4 to 16 livestock per village. Now Nantianhe has increased to 21, and Xiguxian and other villages have developed to 46, an increase of three to four times compared with before liberation. The following methods were adopted by various counties to increase livestock: (1) Purchase in large quantities with loans from banks and credit cooperatives. The Jinan Branch of Huguan and the Baichi and Shanliang Credit Cooperatives once lent more than 6 million Jichaos to the emancipated farmers in 16 villages including Dongbolin to help the masses buy livestock. From April 16th to the end of April, 141 mules, donkeys, and cattle were purchased in half a month. The Yushe County United Cooperative once sent a large number of cadres with funds to the border areas of Yu, Tai, and Qi to buy back 22 livestock. The masses in various villages in Licheng bought 413 livestock at one temple fair with loans from banks and credit cooperatives. The County United Cooperative and the credit department lent millions of yuan to eight credit cooperatives in Xiaguihua, Beiliu, etc. to buy livestock, and the masses increased livestock by 251 head. (2) The number of livestock purchased by the masses from transportation and other sideline production profits is also amazing. Heshun's Nuanyao transported for 40 days last winter and bought back 24 donkeys; Lucheng's Licun Gou produced for two months in winter and earned 13 large mules. Now the village has a total of 67 livestock, exceeding the number before the war. Due to the huge profits obtained from transportation last winter, four villages including Licheng's Xiawan and Dongbi; Heshun's Yicheng; and Shexian's Tanyin bought back 144 head this spring. (3) It is also common in some places to develop livestock with the fruits of struggle. After Dongguanbi Village in Huguan distributed the fruits of struggle, under the leadership of the emancipated hero Huangfu Laichang, it concentrated most of the fruits and bought back 48 livestock. Xiyang's Nanhengshan bought back 13 livestock with the fruits of struggle and organized transportation four times, adding another 13 head. Now the village has an average of one livestock per two households. In order to encourage everyone to buy livestock, Changzhi stipulated that newly purchased livestock would not be required to perform corvée labor within one month. After Guo Deshun in Nantianhe got his share of the fruits of struggle, he did not spend a penny and bought a donkey. (4) All localities have paid special attention to selecting livestock breeds and carrying out mating and breeding of livestock. In the first district, all villages have generally established "Livestock Breeding Committees" and plan to breed livestock to reach the number before the war within three years in addition to purchasing them. In addition to sending special personnel to help, the First Branch of the Jinan Bank has lent 5.6 million Jichaos to the village breeding committees to purchase livestock science. According to incomplete statistics, the villages have purchased more than 50 male donkeys and bulls. In addition, most of the district united cooperatives have also bought one male donkey and one bull each, specializing in mating and pregnancy.

    【本报太行二十九日电】太行各地翻身农民获得土地后，以各种办法增加牲口，以克服劳畜力困难。据长治、长市、壶关、潞城、昔阳、和顺、黎城、涉县、赞皇、榆社等十县四十二个村初步统计，入春以来新增骡、驴、牛二千一百余头。潞城李村沟、壶关百尺，和顺暖窑等十余村已超过战前牲口数。长治南天河、西故县等四村，在解放前每村只有牲口四头到十六头，现南天河已增到二十一头，西故县等村已发展到四十六头，比解放前增加三倍至四倍。各县增加牲口时采用了以下办法：（一）用银行与信用社贷款大量购买，壶关冀南支行与百尺、山两信用社，曾贷给东柏林等村十六村翻身农民冀钞六百余万元，帮助群众买牲口，从四月十六日到四月底半月内购回骡、驴、牛一百四十一头。榆社县联社曾派出大批干部携款赴榆、太、祁边沿区买回牲口二十二头，黎城各村群众用银行与信用社贷款在一次庙会上即购买牲口四百一十三头。县联社、信用部在下桂花、北流等八个信用社贷出买牲口款数百万元，群众增加牲口二百五十一头。（二）群众以运输与其他副业生产获利购买的牲口数也很惊人。和顺暖窑去冬运输四十天，买回毛驴二十四头；潞城李村沟冬季生产两月，赚回大骡子十三头，现全村共牲口六十七头，超过战前数目。黎城下湾、董壁；和顺仪城；涉县弹音等四个村由于去冬运输获得巨大利润，今春买回一百四十四头。（三）用斗争果实发展牲口的地方也很普遍。壶关东关壁村分到果实后，在翻身英雄皇甫来长带领下，集中了大部果实买回牲口四十八头。昔阳南横山用果实买回牲口十三头，组织起来运输了四次，又增加了十三头，现该村两户平均有牲口一头。长治各村为鼓励大家买牲口，规定新买牲口一个月内不支差，南天河郭德顺分到果实后，没舍得花一个，买了一头毛驴。（四）各地特别注意了选择牲口种，进行交配繁殖牲口。一分区各村，普遍成立“牲口繁殖委员会”，并计划在三年内除购买外，繁殖的牲口要达到战前数目。冀南银行一分行除派专人帮助外，已将五百六十万元冀钞贷给各村繁殖委员会购买牲畜科。据不完全统计各村已购到公驴、公牛五十余头，此外大部区联社也已买到公驴、公牛各一头，专事交配怀胎。
