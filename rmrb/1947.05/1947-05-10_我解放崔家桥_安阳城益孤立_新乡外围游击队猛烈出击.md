　　[Our newspaper, Yubei Front, 8th dispatch] The People's Liberation Army, on the night of the 6th, captured Cuijiaqiao, an important stronghold of the Chiang Kai-shek puppet regime east of Anyang. This stronghold was the old nest of Wang Ziquan, the commander of the notorious traitor Chiang's "People's Self-Defense Third Corps" in northern Henan, and its fortifications were exceptionally solid.

　　[Our newspaper, Yubei Front, 8th dispatch] The second batch of nine captured Chiang Kai-shek puppet military officers and generals from Sun Dianying's troops in the Tangyin Campaign were sent to our rear on the 5th. Among them were Yang Keyou, Major General Commander of the 5th Corps of the Chiang Kai-shek puppet Third Column; He Nongwu, Major General Senior Advisor of the Corps Headquarters; Liu Ziying, Colonel Chief of Staff of the Corps; Chang Pingshi, Colonel Commander of the First Regiment; Xu Pinqing, Lieutenant Colonel Orderly Captain of the Column; Li Peiyou, Lieutenant Colonel Adjutant of the Sixth Corps; Liu Qizhong, Lieutenant Colonel Military Law Director of the Column; Shao Wenyuan, Lieutenant Colonel Training Battalion Commander of the Column; and Chen Yuansun, Major Transportation Director of the Column.

　　[Our newspaper, Yubei Front dispatch] Our "Handan" troops, in coordination with the masses of the third district of Jixian County, have launched a series of sabotage operations against the Xin-Ji section of the Pinghan Railway in recent days. On the evening of the 25th of last month, our valiant engineers planted explosives on the railway near Guanzhuang. When a military train arrived at Guanzhuang at around 6 a.m. on the 26th, it was immediately blown up by our pre-planted explosives. On the evening of the 26th, our "Chenjiapo" troops also covered the masses to destroy six miles of railway and harvested more than 600 catties of electric wire. On the same evening, our engineers also destroyed a railway bridge in Renlitun, further disrupting enemy traffic between Xinxiang and Jixian.

　　[Our newspaper, Yubei Front dispatch] Our Xinxiang First, Second, and Third District Armed Work Teams and District Cadre Teams, in order to cooperate with the main force to eliminate Chiang Kai-shek's puppets, began to actively operate in various places at the end of last month. In the past month, the footprints of our guerrilla forces have been seen in large and small villages around the city. In early April, the First District Cadre Team captured more than 50 puppet district chiefs and local tyrants in the Lubao and Chenbao areas. At the same time, they seized a diamond drill, more than 20 catties of explosives, and three large boxes of detonators at the Luwangfen Station. The Second District Cadre Team has repeatedly suppressed Chiang's secret agents and local "Homecoming Legions" in Hehe, Chenbao, and other places. On the 15th, a battalion of the Third Division of Chiang's army attacked Huaicunying from Chenbao but was repelled by us. Zhang Jizhen, a notorious bandit and black gunner from the Huaicunying area, was captured and executed by us, eliminating a major scourge for the people. The Third District Armed Work Team, in coordination with the Shizhuang District Armed Work Team of Huojia County, launched an attack on Yingmaqiao on the morning of April 19, completely defeating the 150 enemy troops stationed there and destroying all the blockhouse fortifications, causing the Huojia enemies to panic day and night, keeping their four gates tightly closed, and daring not to enter or exit. Currently, the Ancun Bridge and Yongkang Bridge on the Dan River are completely under our control. The enemy puppets, Li Changwu, Liu Jinzhan, and others, dare not live in the villages, and sleep in wheat fields and roadside ditches at night. He Zibin, a bullying landlord who threatened the people of Fengcun, has been shot by us. On April 27, two squad leaders of the 40th Army and Wang, the secret service chief of the Hehe Town Office, who went to Yongkang to extort grain and fodder, were captured alive, and an important batch of documents was seized. In addition, 21 fugitive landlords hiding in Fengcun, Loucun, and Yongkang areas were captured by us. At present, the masses in more than 40 villages in the county have paid public grain to us. Wherever our government personnel and troops go, the masses come to us to complain and denounce the crimes of the Kuomintang.
