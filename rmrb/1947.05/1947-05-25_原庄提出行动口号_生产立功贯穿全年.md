　　Yuanzhuang Proposes Action Slogan
　　Production to Achieve Merit Throughout the Year
　　[Report from Zuoquan by this newspaper] Yuanzhuang Village in Zuoquan, under the general goal of both production to achieve merit and not neglecting the front lines, men and women alike went to the fields, and people of all ages were not idle. Everyone consciously participated in the intense campaign to rush sowing. The four mutual aid teams in the village originally planned to sow 420 mu in five days, but exceeded the plan by 52.5 mu. Forty-four children and thirty-two women in the village regularly went to the fields to help with the work, leading livestock to sow seeds, and each could do the work of one person. In the rush sowing, everyone was full of spirit and striving to achieve merit, becoming leaders in production, and a large number of activists emerged. For example, the woman Li Fumei, whose husband went to war, teamed up with others to pull the seed drill to sow millet, and sowed four mu early in the morning. Li Chunlian and seven other women carried manure for three full days, a total of 165 loads, saving six workdays for men without delaying cooking. Military dependent Liu Daishu is a 54-year-old woman, but she is quick and efficient when she works, as energetic as young women. She leads the women to the fields early every morning after eating, and everyone in the team praises her. As a result, even some men who previously did not believe that women could handle the work are now vying to have women do the work for them. Many activists have also emerged among the men. Yuan Yuhe, the team leader of the first team, did not come back to send meals at noon in order to catch up with the work, and saved five workdays by carrying manure early in the morning and building more than ten zhang of embankments. Yang Wu Ba is strong and powerful. When changing work in the team to carry manure, others carry one load, but he can carry two loads at once, and he is always ahead of everyone. Yuan Shuangxi, a 67-year-old man from the third team, refused to admit that he was old in the sowing campaign to achieve merit. Last year, he did eight tenths of the work in the team, but these days he has been plowing the land and doing ten tenths of the work. Everyone said, "He is really an old hero. Although he is getting older every year, the amount of work he does is increasing every year." Wei Chou Xiao, an old man in his fifties, rang the bell every day as soon as it was dawn to motivate everyone to get up early and go to the fields. Miao Yinjiang is also a team leader, always holding a bowl and discussing life with the team members while eating, unwilling to delay the whole work. This large group of production leaders has received unanimous praise from the villagers. There are still 629 mu in the village that have not been sown, and nine more civilians and four donkeys have gone to the front to transport grain. The weather is not raining, and a drought has formed. The leadership put forward: "If we are late, we will not be able to sow, it is really one day late, one year of hunger." They further encouraged everyone to bring their enthusiasm for achieving merit to the entire production process. Under the slogan "In the whole year of production, from small merits to great merits," all the men, women, old and young in the village unanimously put forward the fighting direction of "Rush again, sow quickly, and complete everything by the end of the month," and studied ways to catch up with the work. Wei Zhaoxiang from the third team also proposed that in order to finish sowing as soon as possible, they decided to sow first and then trim the edges later. They are now continuing to rush to sow in such a tense atmosphere.

　　原庄提出行动口号
    生产立功贯穿全年
    【本报左权讯】左权原庄全村在生产立功，前后方两不误的总目标下，男女齐上地，大小没闲人，大家都自觉的卷入了紧张的突击下种运动。全村四个互助大队原计划五天下种四百二十亩，结果超过计划五十二亩半。全村四十四个儿童、三十二个妇女经常上地帮助做活，牵牲口点种籽，都能一人顶一人用。突击下种中，个个都是精神饱满的争取立功，当生产中的带头人，涌现出大批积极分子。如妇女李福梅，男人去参战，她配上别人拉耧种谷，一清早就种了四亩。李春莲等七个妇女整整担了三天粪，共担了一百六十五担，省出男人六个工，还不误做饭。军属刘代数是五十四岁的老太婆，做起活来手紧足快，和青年妇女一样有劲头，每天早早吃过饭就领着妇女上了地，全队人人赞扬她。这一来连以前根本不相信妇女顶事的个别男人都争着让妇女给做活了。男人中间也出现不少积极分子，一队组长原玉和为了赶工，晌午送饭不回来，起早担粪省出工五天垒了十多丈堰。杨五八力气大，在队里变工担粪旁人担一担，他一下能担两担，还是总在大家头前走。三队六十七岁的原双喜老汉，在下种立功运动中也不服老，去年在队里做活顶八分，这几天更掌起犁耕地顶成十分，大家都说：“真是老英雄，年纪虽然一年比一年老了，可是分却一年比一年顶的多。”五十多岁的魏丑小老汉，每天天刚亮就当当的打了钟，推动大家起早上地。苗银江也是个组长，总是在吃饭时端着碗和组员们商议生活，不肯耽误整工。这一大批生产带头人已得到全村群众一致的表扬。全村还有六百二十九亩尚未下种，又有九个民夫四头毛驴到前方运粮，天又不下雨，旱象已成，领导上便提出：咱们再迟了种不上，真是误一天饿肚一年。更进一步鼓舞启发大家把立功热情，带到整个生产中去，在“全年生产中，由小功到大功”的鼓动口号下，全村男女老幼一致提出：“突击再突击、下种快下种，月底一齐完成”的奋斗方向，并研究出赶工的办法，三队魏照祥并提出为了早日种完，决定先种上以后再刨边。现正在这样紧张的气氛中继续突击下种。
