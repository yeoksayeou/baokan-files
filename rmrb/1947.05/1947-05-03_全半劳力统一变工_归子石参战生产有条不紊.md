　　Full and Part-Time Labor Unified Work Exchange
    Gui Zishi Participates in Production in an Orderly Manner

    [This newspaper, Licheng] Gui Zishi is a natural village in Langou. The entire village has 32 households, 24 full-time male laborers, 10 part-time laborers, 22 full-time female laborers, 10 part-time laborers, and 9 head of livestock. Labor hero Li Fushun, in order to fully organize the labor and livestock of the entire village to get rich and give full play to everyone's enthusiasm for production labor, and to overcome the difficulties of the lack of labor and livestock under the new situation, led the villagers to discuss in the winter school last October how to comprehensively organize and give full play to everyone's enthusiasm for production labor and get rich, etc. After several days of deliberation and discussion by men, women, old and young in the entire village, detailed standards for organization, conversion of work, work exchange, and profit sharing were obtained. The labor and livestock of the entire village were unified for work exchange, work points were used uniformly, and work was calculated according to tasks, with profit sharing based on work points. In the half-year implementation, everyone felt convenient and appropriate. Therefore, in the busy work of participating in the war, supporting the front, and production this spring, the work of the village is still proceeding in an orderly manner.
    1. In terms of specific organization, the entire village has a production committee to uniformly control the entire production work, with five sections: (1) The agriculture section has four people, responsible for researching technology, adjusting labor and livestock, seeds, replenishing agricultural tools, repairing agricultural tools, grasping all agricultural production plans, and managing a blacksmith's furnace and a weaving team. (2) The business section manages the income from agricultural and sideline products, receives and distributes finished products from various sections, supplies raw materials, promotes finished products, is responsible for internal and external sales negotiations, and manages wages, work points, and profit sharing. (3) The transportation section has four people, responsible for soliciting transportation jobs and allocating labor and livestock for round-trip transportation. (4) The mountain products section manages going to the mountains to cut mountain products and firewood, etc. (5) The textile section has two men and women responsible for managing the receipt and distribution of cotton, thread, and cloth, researching technology, improving tools, and solving all difficulties in textile production.
    2. Appropriate conversion of work, various labor forces, after everyone's democratic discussion, are uniformly implemented according to the weight of work, living conditions, and degree of completion, with work calculated according to tasks.
    3. Reasonable profit sharing, in order to reward auxiliary labor and give full play to his enthusiasm, this type of person is first paid according to his work points within the total production profit income, and the remaining profit is then uniformly distributed according to work points.
    4. Specific practices: The business section uniformly distributes work tickets to various sections, and each section hands over the finished products to the business section for a monthly summary. After the summary, each laborer uses his own work tickets to exchange for wages at the business section, and the entire production work proceeds in an orderly manner.
    The production committee uniformly uses the labor and livestock of the entire village, combining support for the front, participation in the war, substitute farming, and agricultural and sideline production; at the same time, it also organizes all the auxiliary labor in the entire village, expanding the labor force.

　　全半劳力统一变工
    归子石参战生产有条不紊
    【本报黎城讯】归子石是岚沟一个自然庄，全村有三十二户，男全劳力二十四个，半劳力十个，女全劳力二十二个，半劳力十个，牲口九头。劳动英雄李福顺为了把全村劳畜力全部组织起来发家致富，发挥各人的生产劳动积极性，克服新形势下劳畜力缺乏的困难，在去年十月间即领导全村群众在冬学讨论了怎样全面组织起来，发挥大家的生产劳动积极性与发家致富等问题，经过全村男女老少好几天的酝酿讨论，得出组织、折工、变工、分红等详细标准，全村劳畜力统一变工，统一使用工票，统一按活计工，以工分红。在半年的实行中，都很感便利与适当，所以今春参战、支差、生产的繁忙工作中，该村的工作仍是有条不紊的进行。
    一、具体组织上，全村设生产委员会，统一掌握整个生产工作，下设五股：（一）农业股四个人，负责研究技术，调剂劳畜力、种籽、补充农具、修理农具、掌握农业生产一切计划，管理一个铁匠炉，一个编作组。（二）营业股管理农副业钱财收入，收发各股成品，供给原料，推销成品，负责内外买卖交涉，掌握工资、工票、分红。（三）运输股四人，负责揽脚，分配劳畜力来往运货。（四）山货股，管理上山砍山货、打柴等。（五）纺织股，男女二人负责管理收发棉花、线、布，研究技术，改良工具，解决纺织中一切困难问题。
    二、适当折工，各种劳动力经过大家民主讨论，按轻重生活，成品程度，统一实行按活计工。
    三、合理分红，为了奖励辅助劳动力，发挥他的积极性，这类人是先在总的生产红利收入内按他的工分去，下余的即统一按工分红。
    四、具体做法，营业股一总把工票统一发给各股，各股把成品交给营业股，一月一总结。在总结后各个劳力便以自己的工票到营业股换工资，整个生产工作有条不紊。
    生产委员会把全村劳畜力统一使用，把支差、参战、代耕、农副业都结合起来；同时也把全村的辅助劳力也都组织起来，扩大了劳动面。（四区通讯小组）
