　　Calculating Grain Reserves, Strengthening Production
  　井店 Village Prepares for Famine
    [This newspaper, Shexian News] After seeing Chairman Yang's call to prevent drought and prepare for famine, labor hero Liu Caibang convened key cadres to study how to do it. Liu Caibang said, "We must educate the masses to produce, save, and have surplus grain." After everyone discussed it, the cadres divided the work and went to various streets and groups to mobilize. Liu Caibang focused on model group leaders Zhang Xuegui, Lü Dezheng, Li Hehui, and others, going deep into the groups and using calculations to get through to people's thinking. At the same time, he called his own group members to discuss: "It hasn't rained until now, and the harvest will be less. What should we do?" Everyone in the group clamored that they dared not waste and must save. They unanimously put forward the slogan: "Produce, save, and have surplus grain, resolutely defeat old Chiang!" At this time, everyone was energetic, and Liu Caibang said, "How can we save?" Everyone said, "In the past, each person ate twelve taels of rice every day, but now each person must save seven taels and eat half a catty." Caibang said, "Everyone is right, we are not afraid of any difficulties if we continue to do this!" Then he calculated the total grain of the whole group. The current equivalent of fine grain is 3,221 jin. Each person eats half a catty of rice and one catty of vegetables a day. The whole group eats a total of twelve and a half jin of rice and twenty-five jin of vegetables a day. The existing grain and vegetables are enough for the whole group to eat for nine months. It is estimated that 125 shi of wheat can be harvested in May, plus an oil mill that can press three rounds of oil every day, earning 4,012 yuan. The plan is to earn 963,000 yuan by the end of the year, based on eight months. If we don't save and each person still eats twelve taels of rice a day, then the group will eat eighteen and twelve-tenths jin, which can only be eaten for five months and nineteen days. If each person saves four taels, then we can eat for an extra three months and eleven days. This calculation allows us to eat until the end of the year, and still have a net surplus of 120.5 shi of wheat and the oil mill earning 963,000 yuan. Now that spring plowing will be completed in five days, in addition to participating in the war, we will immediately carry out oil pressing and transportation. This calculation turned all the group members from worry to smiles. Group member Jiang Changlin said, "Are we still afraid that Chiang Kai-shek, the traitorous bandit, will not collapse?" After his group made a plan, they broadcast to the whole village at night, coordinating with all the cadres and model group leaders to go deep into various streets and groups to mobilize, setting off a calculation, production, and conservation movement for all 4,393 people in the village.

　　计算存粮加强生产
  　井店全村人人备荒
    【本报涉县讯】四区井店村看到杨主席防旱备荒的号召后，劳动英雄刘才榜召集主要干部研究如何做，刘才榜说：“要教育群众生产节约余粮。”大家讨论好后，干部分工到各街深入小组着手动员。刘才榜抓紧模范小组长张学贵、吕德政、李和会等，深入小组，用算账的方式去打通思想，同时召集自己的小组员商量：“天到现在不下雨，年景要少收，咱怎样办。”组员人人都吵着这可不敢浪费，非节约不可。一致提出口号：“生产节约余粮，坚决打垮老蒋！”这时大家有了劲，刘才榜说：“咱怎样节约？”大家说：“以前每天每口吃米十二两，现在每口要节约七两，按半斤来吃。”才榜说：“大家说的很对，这样干下去任何困难咱们是不怕的！”接着把全组粮食计算了一下，现有折合细粮三千二百廿一斤，每口一天吃米半斤，菜一斤，全组一天共吃米十二斤半，共吃菜二十五斤，现有粮食和菜够全组九个月吃，估计五月还能收麦子十二石五升，再加上油坊一座，每天能打三糟油，赚洋四千零十二元，计划做到年底，以八个月算，能赚洋九十六万三千元；要不节约以每口每天还吃十二两米算，一天共吃米十八斤十二两，只能吃五个月零十九天，以每口节约四两算，就能多吃三个月零十一天，这样计算就能吃到年底，还净余麦子十二石零五升和油坊赚洋九十六万三千元。现在春耕再用五天就完成，除参战外，立即进行打油带运输，这样一算，全组组员从忧愁转为笑脸，组员江长林说：“这还怕蒋介石卖国汉奸不垮？”从他小组定出计划后，黑夜就对全村广播，配合全体干部模范组长深入各街各小组动员，掀起了全村四千三百九十三口人的计算生产节约运动。（鹏翔、凤山、作楫）
