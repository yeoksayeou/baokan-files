Introducing Comrade Jin Zhongye: Experiences in Manufacturing Hog Cholera Serum
    Bian Fu Construction Department
    The Berkshire breeding pigs raised by the Bian Fu Farm's stud farm contracted hog cholera. Initially, old methods were used, such as feeding them saltpeter and sulfur powder, piercing their nostrils, and feeding them garlic… but they were ineffective. Two pigs died, and almost all the others were infected. Later, the decision was made to slaughter a pig to manufacture a vaccine. The trial was successful, and most of the pigs were cured. Now, the main experiences are introduced below for reference in various regions:

    (1) Disease Judgment: This time, hog cholera was judged to be swine fever. The symptoms are roughly as follows: At the onset of the disease, the body temperature is 40.5 to 50 degrees Celsius, the spirit is listless, the tip of the nose is dry, the stool is dry and hard, turning grayish-green, gradually becoming serious, the pigs are afraid of cold, stop eating, like to lie prone, arch their backs, the skin on the ears and abdomen turns red, the conjunctiva is inflamed, the whites of the eyes turn reddish-red, yellow pus is discharged from the corners of the eyes, the stool becomes grayish-yellow or yellow and loose, breathing becomes difficult, and some pigs bleed from their nostrils. After dissection and examination, it was determined to be hog cholera. Hog cholera is an infectious disease, with acute cases dying in seven days, and the most acute cases dying suddenly. The infection is more common in summer and autumn, and the mortality rate is very high. Piglets are more susceptible to infection. The pathogen is a toxin that can pass through a clay filter, and cannot be seen with an ordinary microscope. It cannot be transmitted to humans or other animals.

    (2) Vaccine Manufacturing Process: After disinfecting the skin of the infected pig, it is slaughtered. The blood is placed in a sterilized ceramic basin, and the basin is placed in a tank of cold water. The top is covered with paper to prevent dust from falling in. After two days, the blood will coagulate into a blood cake, with a light yellow liquid floating on top, which is the serum. Use a pipette to suck the serum into a measuring cup, measure it, and then put it into a sterilized bottle. Add 50% carbolic acid, or 7.5% chloroform, or 5.5% Lysol, and shake slightly. Then use about two fingers thick of absorbent cotton wrapped in two layers of gauze to filter it. To prevent cotton fibers from filtering into the serum, the cotton can be soaked in physiological saline beforehand, wrung out the water, and then filtered. The filtered liquid is the germ seed, which can be used for injection. This germ seed can be used for prevention.

    (3) Precautions for Injection: Originally, this vaccine could only be used for prevention, but we were afraid that we would not have time to manufacture therapeutic serum, so we injected all pigs, regardless of whether they were sick or not, or how severe their illness was. As a result, except for those with deep-seated disease who were too weak to survive and died, most of the mild cases recovered. The following points should be noted during injection: (1) Injection volume: 1 CC for pigs weighing 30 jin or less, 2 CC for 30 jin to 60 jin, 3 CC for 60 jin to 100 jin, 5 CC for 100 jin to 200 jin, and 8 CC for 200 jin to 300 jin. (2) The injection needle should be washed with alcohol and physiological saline once every time a needle is inserted, otherwise the needle will stick to the needle tube, and there will be obstacles in inserting and withdrawing the needle tube. (3) Pay attention to strict disinfection. (4) After injection, they should be raised in isolation, and attention should be paid to feed management, and appropriate amounts of garlic and vegetables should be fed.

    (4) Preliminary Experience: After this bold attempt, we have confidence in future veterinary epidemic prevention. Berkshire pigs have a weak resistance to hog cholera, and more green feed containing Vitamin C, such as broom seedlings and fennel wild vegetables, should be added to their feed to increase their resistance, especially when feeding pigs with distiller's grains and lees. Based on this work experience, it is possible for us to further manufacture immune serum under our existing conditions.

　　介绍金重冶同志：制造猪瘟血清的经验
    边府建设厅
    边府农场种畜场养的巴克夏种猪，传染了猪瘟，上去采用了老办法，吃硝磺散、扎鼻孔、吃大蒜，……但未发生效果，死去两头，其他也几全感染，后决心宰杀一头猪，制造疫苗。试用结果，大部治好了。现在择其主要经验，介绍如下，供各地参考：
    （一）病症判断：这次猪瘟已判断是霍乱，其病征大致如下：得病开始，体温四○·五到五○度，精神萎顿，鼻端发干，大便干结成灰绿色，渐次沉重，怕冷、停止饮食、喜伏卧、背拱、耳上及腹部皮肤发红、眼膜发炎、眼白作赤红色、眼角排出黄色浓质物，大便成灰黄色或黄色稀斗、气喘，有的鼻孔出血。经解剖后检验，确定为猪霍乱。猪霍乱病是一种传染病，急性的七日死，最急性的突然死去。传染多在夏秋两季，死亡率很大，小猪更容易感染。病菌是一种能透过陶土滤过器的毒体，普通显微镜不能看到。不能传染人体及其他畜类。
    （二）疫苗制造经过：把瘟猪的皮肤消毒后宰杀，把血放到消过毒的磁盆里，连盆放到凉水缸里，上面盖上纸，防止尘土落进去，过两天后，血液凝结成血饼，上面浮着淡黄色的液体就是血清。用吸管把血清吸入量杯里，量后放到已经消毒的瓶里，加百分之五十石炭酸，或百分之七·五哥罗纺，或百分之五·五来沙儿，稍加振荡，然后再用约二指厚的脱脂棉，外包两层沙布过滤。为了防止棉花纤维滤到血清里，可以事先把棉花在生理食盐水里浸一下拧去水分，再行过滤。滤下液体就是病苗，可以注射用。这种病苗可以做预防用。
    （三）注射应注意事项：本来这种疫苗只能做预防用，但我们怕来不及制造治疗血清，所以不管有病、没病、病重、病轻，悉行注射。结果除病太深者，体力不支，死去两头，其余轻者大部痊愈，注射时应注意：（１）注入量：体重三○斤以下一ＣＣ○三○斤到六○斤二ＣＣ。六○斤到一○○斤三ＣＣ。一○○斤到二○○斤五ＣＣ。二○○斤到三○○斤八ＣＣ。（２）注射针每打一针应用酒精及生理食盐水洗一次针管，否则粘住管针，进退针管便会发生障碍。（３）注意消毒严密。（４）注射后应隔离饲养，并注意饲料管理，适当的喂些大蒜青菜。
    （四）初步经验：经过这次大胆的尝试，对今后兽疫预防有了信心。巴克夏抵抗猪霍乱力量弱，饲养料里应多加些含维他命Ｃ的青饲料，扫帚苗、茴茴菜等野菜，增加它的抵抗力，尤其是用粉渣酒糟喂猪更应注意。根据这次工作经验，在我们现有的条件下，进一步制造免疫血清是可能的。
