Xinhua News Agency, Northern Henan Front, 3rd. In the Battle of Cuiping Mountain (north of Jun County) in Northern Henan, the Yi character unit of the People's Liberation Army published blackboard newspapers to inspire combat enthusiasm, with great effect. The Second Detachment of the Eighth District of the unit accepted the task of defending Cuiping Mountain. The blackboard newspaper of the detachment headquarters immediately wrote an editorial: "Build good fortifications, block aircraft and artillery, and perform meritorious service on the mountain." After reading it, the soldiers first rushed to build fortifications and launched a fortification construction competition. When the battle began, the enemy shelled the top of the mountain. The soldiers fought in the fortifications while continuing to write articles and read the newspaper. Machine gunner Dai Yuancheng, after repelling the enemy, immediately wrote an article saying: "My machine gun has repelled the enemy, defended Chairman Mao, we must perform meritorious service on Cuiping Mountain, and go to see the blackboard newspaper later!" Eighteen-year-old gunner Zeng Xian used seven shells to crush the attack of more than a hundred enemies, and immediately wrote a message to the blackboard newspaper: "The enemy's charge is not scary, seven shells will repel them!" During the two-day blocking battle, the soldiers wrote nearly two hundred articles. A certain political commissar said: The blackboard newspaper played a huge role in the victory of this battle.

　　豫北翠屏山战斗中
    门板报起了大作用
    【新华社豫北前线三日电】解放军毅字部队在豫北翠屏山（浚县北）阻击战中，出版门板报，鼓舞战斗热情，效果极大。该部八区队二分队接受了固守翠屏山的任务，分队部的门板报上即写出：《要作好工事，挡住飞机大炮，在山头上立功》的社论。战士们看了，先赶筑工事，展开了作工事竞赛。战斗开始，敌人炮击山顶，战士们一面在工事里作战，一面继续写稿读报。机枪射手戴元成把敌人打退后，立刻写稿说：“我的机枪把敌人打退了，保卫毛主席，我们要在翠屏山上立功，等一下去看门板报吧！”十八岁的小炮手曾现以七发炮弹打垮百余敌人的进攻，马上给门板报写消息：“敌人冲锋不可怕，七发炮弹就打退啦！”在两天阻击战中，战士们写稿将近二百篇，某政委说：这次战斗的胜利，门板报起了极大的作用。
