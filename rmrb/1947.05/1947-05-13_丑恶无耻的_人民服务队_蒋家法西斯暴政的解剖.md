　　The Ugly and Shameless "People's Service Corps"
    An Anatomy of Chiang Kai-shek's Fascist Tyranny
    Wu Xiang
    Everything that sounds pleasant coming from Chiang Kai-shek's mouth is a disgusting false front. However, no sign is more ugly and shameless than the "People's Service Corps." This so-called "People's Service Corps" is directly under Chiang's "Ministry of National Defense." The members are selected from young military officers and students in the military, and given special training by the News Bureau. They are all staunch special agents—loyal Party "League" members. According to the "top secret" "Pacification Political Work Manual," the "People's Service Corps" follows the "bandit suppression" troops to "strengthen 'revolutionary action' and serve as the vanguard of political struggle," and "has the right to intervene in all military, political, economic, cultural, and educational facilities to make them suitable for 'bandit suppression' needs." Dressed in American military uniforms and wielding American weapons, they are divided into groups and sent deep into townships and villages to "reorganize the Bao-Jia system to ensure that every person is registered to a household and every household is registered to a Jia," "thoroughly cleanse the villages, implementing a system of joint guarantee and collective responsibility," and "establish secret voluntary police in each Bao." The "National Identity Cards" they issue make the "Good Citizen Certificates" of the Japanese invaders look pale in comparison. The fingerprinting section alone has ten grids, meaning that every finger of everyone under their rule is not allowed to escape.
    Of course, at first, these bandits always pretend to conceal their true colors. They start by running national primary schools or consumer cooperatives, doing things to deceive the people. A group from the Seventh Detachment arrived in Mingwang Township, west of Changyuan City, before the Chinese New Year. The heads of seven of the eight Bao in the township presented many gifts as usual, but they pretended to be furious, convened a "mass meeting," severely rebuked them, and even praised the head of the Second Bao, who had not sent any gifts. The method was indeed very cunning: first, to deceive the good people and show that they were very "incorruptible"; second, to give the "cunning" Bao heads a warning to make them obedient; in fact, they did not refuse "gifts," but wanted more. First, completely overwhelm you, and then demand whatever they want at will—money, goods, life, your whole family cannot escape their control.
    Those in the people who dare to resist or express dissatisfaction are slandered as "communist bandits" and are included in the suppression list. Under the "secret orders" of the "People's Service Corps," can the so-called "communist bandits" and "communist bandit suspects" who have been arrested and massacred be counted? According to an incomplete statistic from Hua County, more than 1,300 ordinary people were killed by the "People's Service Corps." Among them was Zhao Qingchen, the director of the farmers' association in a certain street south of the city. After he was dragged out and buried alive, the prison guard (naturally a "People's Service Corps member") still asked his wife for cigarettes and noodles every day. This poor woman, with an eight-year-old child, with tragic hope, sold everything in her house, bought things, and sent them to the prison, begging to see her husband every time, but never seeing him, until a neighbor saw someone selling the pants her husband wore on the street, and only then did she know that he had been buried alive.
    She took her child and kowtowed everywhere to beg for mercy, and sent out the last 8,000 yuan of Chiang's currency she had exchanged for selling furniture, only to dig out her husband's body, cry a little, and bury him hastily. However, her "National Identity Card" stated "wife of a communist bandit," and she became a "black person" whom no one dared to take in. She went to her mother's house in Sanlisu Village, east of the city, but only stayed for two days before they had to check the household registration, and her mother's family did not dare to keep her. She went to her grandmother's house outside Hujiazhuang, west of the Wei River, and stayed for three days before they had to check the household registration again, and they did not dare to keep her. She went to her aunt's house in Xiguan, and her aunt gave her 5,800 yuan, but did not dare to keep her. She went to her nephew's house in Xiheji, and her nephew gave her three liters of corn flour, but still did not dare to keep her. She went to her sister's house in Kangzhuang, and her sister hugged her and her child and cried bitterly for a day, but they had to check the household registration again, and still did not dare to keep her. Terror always followed this widow and orphan, and all the relatives had been begged, but they were powerless to help. The claws of the "People's Service Corps" were tightly gripping her, and an unexpected misfortune could suddenly occur at any time.
    When the "People's Service Corps" fled Yangwu City, they forced more than 200 students from Yangwu Middle School to carry a gun each, threatening, "Whoever doesn't follow us wants to be a communist bandit." The students in the city all fled home and hid. The students from the surrounding villages were all taken away, and 15-year-old Xia Guoming was not spared.
    The crisis of Chiang's tyranny is already so deep. The corrupt bureaucratic apparatus can no longer suppress the people, so that the "People's Service Corps" in the form of Hitler's stormtroopers, dressed in American military uniforms and wielding American weapons, must go directly to the townships and villages to carry out a reign of terror. But can these fascist bandits save Chiang Kai-shek's doomed fate? When Yang Qingyu and others of the Seventh Detachment were captured, they all tried their best to declare: "We don't have a deep understanding of the Three Principles of the People either, and the money we earn is only equivalent to that of a second lieutenant." These cowardly guys cried out before they even encountered danger: "Spare me! I am willing to be trained on your side, I will serve you." They put away their ferocious appearance towards the people and pretended to wag their tails and beg for mercy, which only increased their ugliness and made them even more disgusting.

　　丑恶无耻的“人民服务队”
    蒋家法西斯暴政的解剖
    吴象
    从蒋介石嘴里说出来的一切动听的名词都是令人恶心的假招牌，然而再没有一块招牌比“人民服务队”更丑恶更无耻的了。这所谓“人民服务队”直属于蒋记“国防部”，队员从青年军官和从军学生中选拔出来，又由新闻局施以专门的特务训练，都是清一色的特务——忠实的党“团”员。根据“极机密”的“绥靖政工手册”的规定，“人民服务队”跟随“‘剿匪’部队推进，为强化‘革命行动’，执行政治斗争的生力军”“有权过问一切军事、政治、经济、文化、教育设施，使适合于‘剿匪’的需要”。他们身穿美式军装，手执美国武器，分组深入乡镇农村，“重编保甲，务使人必归户，户必归甲”，“彻底清乡，联保连坐”，“每保设立秘密义务警察”。他们制发的“国民身份证”使过去日寇的“良民证”大为逊色，仅仅指绞一项就有十格，这就是说他们统治下的每个人的每一个指头都不准逃脱。
    当然匪徒们一开始总是装模作样的隐蔽着自己的面目。他们先着手举办国民小学或消费合作社，作些欺骗人民的事情。第七中队的一个组在年关前到了长垣城西的明望乡，该乡八个保，其中有七个保长都按例送了许多礼物，不料他们竟装模作样大发雷霆，召集“群众大会”，痛加申斥，把没有送礼的第二保保长还夸奖了一番。办法实在很狡猾，第一欺骗善良的老百姓，表明自己很“清廉”，第二给“刁滑”的保长们一个下马威，使其服服贴贴的就范；其实他们不是不要“礼物”，而是要的更多。首先把你完全压倒，然后随心所欲地去要——要钱、要东西、要命，你一家都逃不出他们的掌握。
    人民中胆敢反抗或表示不满的，就被诬为“奸匪”，就在被剿之列。在“人民服务队”的“密令”之下，被逮捕被屠杀的所谓“奸匪”与“奸匪嫌疑犯”还数得清吗？据滑县一个不完全的统计，被“人民服务队”杀害的老百姓就有一千三百多人。其中有一个城南某街的农会主任赵清晨，当他被拖出去活埋之后，狱里的看守（自然也是“人民服务队员”）。还每天向他的老婆要烟、要面。这个可怜的女人带着一个八岁的孩子，怀着悲惨的希望，变卖了家里的一切，买了东西送到狱内去，每一次请求见一见男人，每一次都见不到，直到邻居在街上看见有人卖他男人穿的裤子，才知道是被活埋了。
    她带着小孩到处叩头求情，把最后变卖家具换来的八千元蒋币也送出去，才算把男人的尸首扒出来，哭了一场，草草的葬了。然而她的“国民身份证”上写着“奸匪之妻”，成了没有人敢收留的“黑人”了。她住到城东三里苏庄的娘家去，只住了两天，要清查户口，娘家不敢留她。她住到卫河西胡家庄外祖母家去，住了三天，又要清查户口，又不敢收留她。她又到西关婶母家，只住了一天，婶母送了她五千八百元，但是不敢收留她。她又到西河集侄儿家，侄儿送他三升玉黍面，还是不敢收留她。她又到康庄妹妹家，妹妹抱着她和小孩痛哭了一天，又要清查户口了，仍然不敢收留她。恐怖永远追随着这孤儿寡妇，所有的亲戚都哀求遍了，但是他们爱莫能助。“人民服务队”的魔爪紧紧抓着她，随时都可能有一个意外的不幸突然出现。
    “人民服务队”从阳武城逃窜的那一次，他们强迫发给阳武中学二百多学生每人一枝枪，威胁着说：“谁不跟着走就是想当奸匪。城内的学生都逃回家藏了起来。四乡的学生则全被带走，十五岁的夏国明也没有幸免。
    蒋家暴政的危机已经如此深重。腐朽的官僚机构已经镇压不住人民，以致必须身穿美式军装手执美国武器的，希特拉挺进队型的“人民服务队”直接到乡镇农村去作恐怖的统治。然而这么些法西斯匪徒就能挽救蒋介石灭亡的命运吗？当第七中队的杨庆余等人被俘的时候，他们都竭力声明：“我们对三民主义也并没有深刻的认识，我们赚的钱只相当于一个准尉”。这些卑怯的家伙还没有遇到危险就哭叫起来了：“饶了我吧！我愿意到你们那边受训，我替你们服务”。他们收了对人民残暴的凶像，装出摇尾乞怜之态，更增加其丑恶，格外使人厌恶。
