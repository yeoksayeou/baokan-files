Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th. Comprehensive report: The American imperialist conspiracy to use the International Trade Conference to pursue its expansionist policy and escape the economic crisis has, due to numerous contradictions, yielded no results to date, forcing Marshall to issue lamentations. The United Nations International Trade Conference, initiated by the United States, opened in Geneva on April 10th, with participants including the United States, China (Chiang), Brazil, Chile, Cuba, Britain, Canada, Australia, India, New Zealand, South Africa, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Norway, France, Syria, Lebanon, and Czechoslovakia. The work of the conference was to draft the so-called "International Trade Charter" and the "World Trade Organization Law," and to discuss reducing tariffs. The United States claimed its purpose was to "eliminate obstacles to international trade" and "move towards free world trade," meaning to break down tariff barriers of various countries so that American goods could arbitrarily invade various markets. The United States demanded that seventeen countries significantly reduce tariffs on its export goods, which was unanimously rejected by the seventeen countries. American monopoly oligarchs engaged in exports favored reducing tariffs in order to obtain greater benefits from other countries. However, the oligarchs who monopolize the domestic market not only opposed reducing tariffs but also advocated raising tariffs. While the conference was discussing reducing tariffs, members of the U.S. Congress, representing the interests of the wool industry monopoly oligarchs in various states, proposed a so-called "Wool Act," advocating imposing a high tax of 50 percent on imported wool when necessary to maintain the high price of wool in the domestic market. This bill aroused unanimous opposition from all countries at the International Trade Conference. Australia, which had originally intended to make concessions to the United States, canceled its original intention. Therefore, the head of the American delegation, Clayton, was forced to return to Washington from Geneva on the 17th to persuade the U.S. Congress not to pass the bill in order to salvage this difficult situation. At the same time, Marshall, during the so-called "International Trade Week," desperately called on the participating countries to "cooperate fully" in order to move towards "economic stability," meaning asking countries to sacrifice their own interests so that the United States could escape the economic crisis. The conference will be postponed again from the end of May to the middle of August.

　　十七国在国际贸易会议上
  　反对美国扩张阴谋
  　美出口垄断寡头与国内市场寡头发生尖锐矛盾
    【新华社陕北廿五日电】综合报导：美帝国主义企图利用国际贸易会议遂行其扩张政策并逃避经济危机的阴谋，由于矛盾重重，迄今毫无结果，迫使马歇尔不得不发出悲鸣。由美国所发起的联合国加国际贸易会议，于四月十日在日内瓦开幕，先后参加者计有美、中（蒋）、巴西，智利、古巴、英、加、澳、印、纽西兰、南非、荷、比、卢、挪、法、叙、黎、捷克等国。该会议工作为起草所谓“国际贸易宪章”及“世界贸易机构组织法”，并会商减低关税，美国宣称其目的为“扫除国际贸易阻碍”，“走向世界贸易自由”，其意即系打破各国关税壁垒，以便美货任意侵入各国市场。美国要求十七个国家对其出口货大量减低关税，遭十七国一致拒绝。美国经营出口的垄断寡头赞成减低关税，以便从他国获得更大利益。但垄断国内市场之寡头不但反对减低关税，更主张提高关税。在该会议正商谈减低关税之际，美国会中代表各州羊毛业垄断寡头利益的议员，即提出一项所谓“羊毛法案”，主张在必要时对进口羊毛征收百分之五十的高税，以维持羊毛在国内市场的高价。此一法案在国际贸易会议中引起各国一致反对，澳国本拟对美有所让步，至此乃取消原意。因此美国代表团长克莱敦乃被迫于十七日由日内瓦匆返华府，劝导美国会勿通过该项法案，以求挽救此种困难境遇。同时，马歇尔在所谓“国际贸易周”中声嘶力竭呼吁与会各国“通力合作”，以求走向“经济稳定”；意即要求各国牺牲各自利益，使美国将以逃避经济危机。该会议将再度由五月底延期至八月中结束。
