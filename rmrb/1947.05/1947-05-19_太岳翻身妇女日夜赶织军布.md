(From our paper, Taiyue, 17th) Women in various parts of Taiyue have demonstrated unprecedented enthusiasm and awareness in the self-defense war. In Jiyuan, liberated women, under the slogan "Women should also contribute," worked day and night to complete 150 bolts of military cloth, each exceeding the original length by two or three chi. Women from eight villages including Wohumiao in Anyi completed 1,000 pairs of military shoes in five days. When the government inspected the military shoes, none were rejected, and 40 to 50 pairs weighed more than one jin each. The government specially allocated two shi of wheat as a reward to them. Women in Shangzhuang, Pingyao, transported grain and firewood and transferred wounded soldiers. After the Jinzhuang battle, the village hospital increased its number of wounded soldiers, and eighteen women volunteered to serve in the hospital, taking on nursing duties, washing clothes, and feeding the wounded soldiers with water and food. Women in Zhaijiaqiao, Yicheng, organized a reception station to receive wounded soldiers passing through. Women in Zhangxiang Village, Xiangling, after the men went to war, transported 1,400 jin of white flour to the army, dismantled and washed 130 sets of cotton clothes and 180 quilts, and sewed 15 military uniforms and 120 pairs of socks.
