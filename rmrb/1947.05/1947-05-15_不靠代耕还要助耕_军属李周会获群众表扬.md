Not Relying on Substitute Farming, but Also Helping with Farming
Military Dependent Li Zhouhui Receives Praise from the Masses

[This newspaper, Licheng News] Li Zhouhui, a model military dependent from Lijiayao, is particularly active in production through his own efforts. This spring, he was elected as the head of the mutual aid society. He proposed: "Everyone in the village should work from dawn till dusk to make up for the labor of those participating in the war and those conscripted for service." He does not request anyone to help him with substitute farming. He even helps military dependent Gao Jingui carry manure. He originally carried three loads in half a day for himself, but he could carry five loads for Gao Jingui in half a day without resting. Actively leading the village's agricultural and sideline production, he has become a model team for the whole village. The villagers discussed helping him with fifteen unpaid substitute farming days, but he resolutely refused, which greatly moved all the villagers. Everyone decided to post a merit citation to him. He said to the masses: "This year, I must work hard to achieve 'farming three and surplus one,' and I must lead every household in the society to achieve 'farming three and surplus one.'" The masses immediately sent good news to his son, writing the citation and sending it to the front, hoping that his son would learn from his father: "Kill the enemy and make meritorious service, father and son will have double happiness at the door."

Not only does he work hard in production, but after finishing his own sowing, he also encourages others to sow. He has now been elected as the production team leader; he first helped the military dependents and the families of those participating in the war to sow seeds. His team completed sowing on May 3rd. Now he is helping other teams to sow seeds actively, and guarantees that the entire village will complete sowing in seven days.

He spares time to help others. His daughter-in-law spins six and a half liang of thread every day and leads a weaving team.

　　不靠代耕还要助耕
    军属李周会获群众表扬
    【本报黎城讯】栗家窑模范军属李周会自己动手，劳动生产特别积极，今春当选互助社长。他提出：“全村人应起早搭黑干，补出参战支差代耕工。”他毫不要求帮他代耕，且帮军属郜金贵担圊。本来给自己半天担三担，而给郜金贵半天不歇晌能担五担。积极领导全社农副业生产成为全村模范队，村上群众讨论帮他十五个无代价代耕工，他坚决谢绝，由此大大感动了全村群众，大家决定给他贴立功喜报。他向群众说：“今年我一定要努力生产，达到耕三余一，并且要领导全社家家户户达到耕三余一。”群众并马上给他儿子报喜，将喜贴写上寄到前方，希望他儿子学习他父亲：“杀敌立功，父子双喜进门”。
