　　KMT Soldiers Unwilling to Die
    Desertions Rampant While Crossing the Yellow River
    [Our newspaper's report from Southern Hebei, 9th] Recently, our reporter visited KMT officers of the Southern Hebei Military Officer Training Corps who had been liberated. They were all happily and intently studying. When the topic turned to their experiences crossing the Yellow River to the north, their expressions changed slightly, and they recalled the saying popular among the soldiers: "Crossing the Yellow River is like passing through the Gates of Hell; crossing is easy, returning is hard." The deputy platoon leader of the artillery company of the 312th Regiment of the 104th Brigade, upon receiving the order to cross the Yellow River, was separated from his wife, worried about his elderly mother, and cried all night, leaving behind a quatrain: "Water flows past and never returns, those who cross the Yellow River rarely look back, the Yellow River is like the Milky Way, it's hard for loved ones to meet, who knows their sorrow?" Qin Guanghua, a lieutenant radio operator of the 104th Brigade, said, "Who wants to go to Hebei to die? It's truly a case of the body heading north while the heart goes south!" He recounted sadly that the soldiers were like prisoners when crossing the river. The new recruits who were captured had their clothes taken away at night, and were watched by the veteran soldiers. As a result, both new and old soldiers ran away together. He said, "I saw with my own eyes that while crossing the Yellow River, two deserters were shot dead on the banks of the Yellow River, and one drowned in the raging yellow water. Although the superiors suppressed them in this way, the number of deserters continued to increase!"

　　蒋军士兵不愿送死
    过黄河时纷纷逃亡
    【本报冀南九日电】日前记者走访冀南军官教导团被解放之蒋军军官，他们都在欢快紧张的学习着。当谈到他们北渡黄河的情景时，他们面色微变，忆起了战士们流行的话：“过了黄河鬼门关，过河容易回去难。”一○四旅三一二团炮兵连的副连长，当接到过黄河的命令，与妻子离散，惦念老母，痛哭了一夜、留下了一首绝句：“水流过去不倒流，人过黄河难回头，黄河好似银河界，亲人难见谁知愁？”一○四旅的中尉报务员秦光华说：“谁愿往河北送死呢？真是身向北行心向南走呀？”他感伤的叙述着过河时兵士们像囚犯一样，抓来的新兵，夜里睡觉时衣服收光，叫老兵监视着，结果新老兵一齐跑。他说：“我亲眼看到，渡黄河时，两个逃亡的，一个被打死在黄河滩上，一个淹死在滚滚的黄水里。虽然上级这样镇压，逃跑的仍是愈来愈多！”
