　　Shahe Directs All Districts and Villages
　　Organize the Masses for Drought Prevention

　　[Report from our newspaper in Shahe] Since the beginning of spring, there has been no rain. Now that Guyu (Grain Rain) has passed, planting is still impossible. In light of this situation, the Shahe County Government has specifically instructed all districts and villages to quickly organize the masses to prevent drought.

　　1. The old liberated areas have several years of drought prevention experience. This year, it should be further promoted. Such as returning soil to plant cotton, carrying water to plant various crops, digging wells and opening canals to construct water conservancy projects, and dry planting, villages should organize the masses to discuss and summarize past drought prevention achievements and experiences, recognize that our strength to fight against natural disasters is great, and act quickly.

　　2. The new liberated areas should combine the current production mobilization, break the masses' thinking of relying on the heavens for food, accept the experience of the old liberated areas, and boldly organize the masses to plant from drought prevention. For watered land, people should be organized to pull water carts, and all irrigation equipment should be used. Villages in the Sixth District are irrigating together day and night, not letting the wells be idle. Northeast Liu, West Jiujia, and other villages are building canals, which are all very good methods.

　　3. Save water and irrigate more land. For example, in the Dukou Village canal, in the past, everyone irrigated their own land separately, and when they were done, they would let the water run away. Every year in March, the whole village could not even irrigate the wheat once. This year, a water conservancy committee has been established, and specialized personnel are selected from the mutual aid groups to manage irrigation. It has already been irrigated twice in March. Some villages in the Sixth District can also save water by planting grains in drainage ditches.

　　4. Launch a savings movement. The masses should be mobilized to take a long-term view, not waste a single bit of the fruits of struggle, and save one if they can. (Kui Lin, Shen Xiu)

　　沙河指示各区村
    组织群众防旱
    【本报沙河讯】入春以来天未落雨，现谷雨已过，仍不能下种。根据这种情况，沙河县府特指示各区村，迅速组织群众进行防旱。
    一、老区过去已经有了几年的防旱经验，今年应更加发扬。如还土植棉、担水点种各种庄稼，打井开渠兴修水利与旱耩地等，各村应组织群众讨论与总结过去防旱成绩及经验，认识我们与天灾作斗争的力量是伟大的，迅速的行动起来。
    二、新区应结合当前的生产动员，打破群众靠天吃饭的思想，接受老区经验，从防旱中放手把群众组织起来点种，水地要组织人拉水车，并把一切浇地家具都运用起来。六区各村白天黑夜一齐浇，不让井闲。东北留、西九家等村，都在兴修水渠，这些办法都是很好的。
    三、节省水多浇地。如渡口村的水渠，过去各浇各的，不浇了就把水放跑，每年到三月里，全村麦子还浇不到一遍。今年成立了水利委员会，从互助组内抽选出专人管理浇地，三月已浇过二遍。六区有的村阴沟种谷也能省水。
    四、展开节约运动。应动员群众从长期着眼，不浪费一点斗争果实，省了一个是一个。（奎林、深修）
