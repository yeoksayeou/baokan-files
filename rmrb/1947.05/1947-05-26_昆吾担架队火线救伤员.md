　　【This dispatch from our JiluYu Bureau on the 23rd】The Kunwu County stretcher teams, formed by emancipated peasants, are voluntarily and enthusiastically participating in the war effort, driven by fervent encouragement. Consequently, they have performed many touching deeds in each campaign. The stretcher team from the Third District carried wounded soldiers back, and as dusk approached, they were about to eat when they were immediately called to return again. However, they returned to the front without a single complaint. During each battle, the stretcher bearers competed to go to the front lines to rescue the wounded. When the stretcher bearers milled flour, they often saved some of the good flour to make soup for the wounded on the road. Some stretcher bearers would rather go hungry themselves, but would take out money to buy white steamed buns for their wounded comrades.

　　昆吾担架队火线救伤员
    【本报冀鲁豫二十三日电】昆吾县翻身农民组成的担架队，在热情鼓舞下，自愿的兴奋的参战，因此，在每次战役中，他们做出许多感动人的事迹。三区担架把伤员抬回，天已黄昏，刚要吃饭时，马上就又要往回返，但他们无一声怨言，便返回前方去。在每次战斗中担架员们争着上火线抢救伤员。担架队员磨面时，常把好面留下一些，准备路上给伤员作汤喝，有的担架员宁愿自己挨饿，但却掏出钱给伤员同志买白馍吃。
