　　Commemorating the "May Fourth" Movement and Arts Festival
    Border Region Federation of Literary and Art Circles, Border Region Literary and Art Association Branch
    This year marks the 28th anniversary of the "May Fourth" Movement. The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles designated "May Fourth" as the Arts Festival in 1945, and this is now the third festival. As the liberated areas win a series of victories in late April, fundamentally altering the war situation, and as the US-Chiang alliance is unable to salvage its decline on the national battlefield, our commemoration of the May Fourth Movement and Arts Festival feels particularly significant, joyful, and exciting!

    As Chairman Mao pointed out, the outstanding historical significance of the May Fourth Movement lies in its thorough and uncompromising anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism. History has now proven that only the power of the people led by the proletariat can shoulder this thorough and uncompromising anti-imperialist and anti-feudal burden. For more than twenty years, they have struggled arduously, one after another, always holding high this glorious banner and walking in the forefront! Looking at the situation today, our liberated area's military and civilians are resolutely fighting the US-Chiang alliance with guns in one hand, and unremittingly carrying out land reform thoroughly in the other, with the front and rear lines united in purpose, advancing vigorously and taking great strides. Isn't this even better proof?

    The democracy and science called for by the May Fourth Movement today have more substantial content: the New Democratic politics of serving the people and Mao Zedong Thought. The new culture and new art movement since the May Fourth Movement has also gained a clear direction: serving the people, serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and integrating with the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

    Chairman Mao made the following assessment of the new cultural movement since the May Fourth Movement: "In the past twenty years, the spearhead of this new cultural army has caused tremendous revolutions in thought and form (writing, etc.). Its momentum is so vast and its power so fierce that it is simply invincible. Its mobilization is broader than any historical era." Precisely because of this, the imperialists and their running dogs, especially during the rule of traitor Chiang Kai-shek, spared no effort in brutally strangling and suppressing the new cultural movement! From the sacrifices of revolutionary cultural pioneers such as Li Dazhao, Qu Qiubai, and the seven writers including Hu Yepin in the distance, to the persecution of Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo in recent times, as well as the imprisonment and harm of millions of young intellectuals and cultural workers, a tragic blood-stained history was left for the Chinese new cultural movement, causing the disaster-stricken nation to lose a group of the most outstanding sons and daughters, suffering irreparable losses! However, bloodshed could not stop the advance of the new culture; ten years of encirclement and suppression "produced" a great communist, Lu Xun, who became "the greatest and most heroic flag-bearer of the new cultural army!"

    However, because most cultural workers came from petty-bourgeois intellectuals, their awareness of ideological transformation was insufficient at the time. On the one hand, they suffered cruel suppression from the reactionary rulers, which indeed limited their integration with the worker-peasant masses. For example, the revolutionary art and literature movement, which called for popularization for more than ten years, could not be resolved and was actually limited to the petty bourgeoisie, creating the most serious shortcomings of the revolutionary art and literature movement.

    The new cultural movement since the May Fourth Movement has its great achievements. But if this fundamental problem cannot be solved even now: integrating with the workers and peasants and serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, this movement cannot be pushed forward any further! After Chairman Mao's speech at the Forum on Literature and Art, the vigorous development of literary and artistic activities in the liberated areas is a good proof. For example, in the Border Region, the brilliant achievements of our peasant writer Comrade Zhao Shuli have greatly illuminated the literary and art circles in the liberated areas, providing aspects worthy of our good learning. Especially after the land reform, the broad masses, after turning themselves over, launched a self-singing and self-entertaining literary and artistic movement, stepping into the literary and artistic field, bringing a new atmosphere! And on the front lines of battle, there are also excellent correspondents who have grown up from among the soldiers, such as Battalion Commander Li Wenbo... These facts are enough to prove that the new culture and new art after combining with the workers, peasants, and soldiers will surely have a very bright future!

    But we still need to be vigilant at all times. Are today's comrades in the cultural and artistic circles doing well enough in facing the workers, peasants, and soldiers and integrating with them? Is there a complete understanding of this point in their minds? No, especially for intellectual cultural workers, this is originally a long-term process of transformation.

    As early as 1939, Chairman Mao pointed out so seriously in the Memorial Article on the May Fourth Movement: "...If intellectuals do not combine with the workers and peasants, they will accomplish nothing. The failure of the Xinhai Revolution and the May Fourth Movement is the reason! The final dividing line between revolutionary, non-revolutionary, or counter-revolutionary intellectuals is whether they combine with the workers and peasants and put it into practice. Their final dividing line is only at this point..."

    Today, as we commemorate the May Fourth Movement and the Arts Festival, recalling the past history, especially after Chairman Mao has so clearly pointed out the historical lessons of the May Fourth Movement, looking back at the new atmosphere of cultural work in the liberated areas today, and looking forward to the future, how should we strive forward!

    Commemorating the May Fourth Movement, we must inherit the great and glorious task of the May Fourth Movement, we must truly fight to the end as thorough and uncompromising anti-imperialists and anti-feudalists! As Chairman Mao said to cultural workers: "Go to the masses, become propagandists and organizers of the masses!"

    The doomsday of special agent Chiang Kai-shek is approaching. Commemorating the May Fourth Movement, we should not forget his blood debt of strangling cultural martyrs. Mr. Lu Xun has a famous saying: "Blood debts must be repaid with the same thing!" Today, our pens are combined with guns. We believe that Chiang Kai-shek's blood debt will surely be settled!

    Comrades of the cultural circles and literary and art workers in the Border Region, let us strive to build an independent, peaceful, and democratic New China, and let us strive to build a new culture for the masses of the people. Victory must be ours.

　　纪念“五四”及文艺节
    边区文联　边区文协分会
    “五四”运动到今年已经是二十八周年了。而中华全国文艺界协会于三十四年又定“五四”为文艺节，现在也是第三届节日了，正当四月下旬各解放区赢得一连串的胜利，从此转换战局，美蒋已无法挽救他在全国战场的颓势之际，我们来纪念五四及文艺节，特别感到意义重大，感到欣喜和兴奋！
    如毛主席所提出：五四运动的杰出历史意义，是彻底的不妥协的反帝反封建。现在历史证明了，也只有无产阶级所领导的人民大众的力量才能把这个彻底的不妥协的反帝反封建的担子担起来，二十余年如一日，坚苦奋斗，前仆后继，始终高举这一面光荣的大旗走在最前面！以今天的情形来看，我解放区军民一手拿枪与美蒋坚决作战，一面毫不松懈彻底的实行土地改革，前后方一条心，轰轰烈烈地大踏步前进，难道不就是更好的证明么？
    五四运动高喊的民主与科学，今天都有了更充实的内容：为人民服务的新民主主义的政治与毛泽东思想。而五四以来的新文化新文艺运动，到今天，也同样获得明确的方针：为人民服务，为工农兵，与工农兵结合。
    五四以来的新文化运动，毛主席曾作这样的估计：“二十年来，这个文化新军的锋芒所向，从思想到形式（文字等）无不起了极大的革命。其声势之浩大，威力之猛烈，简直是所向无敌的。其动员之广大，超过任何历史时代。”正因此，帝国主义及其走狗们，特别是到特务头子卖国汉奸蒋介石统治时代，才惟恐不力地对新文化运动进行凶残的绞杀与镇压！远如革命文化界先烈李大钊、瞿秋白、胡也频等七作家之牺牲。近如李公朴与闻一多之被难，以及千百万青年知识分子与文化工作者之被禁锢与残害，为中国新文化运动留下一页悲壮的血染的历史，使灾难深重的民族丧失了一批最优秀的儿女，遭受到不可挽回的损失！但流血也阻制不住新文化的前进；十年的围剿却“剿”出了一个伟大的共产主义者鲁迅，他成了“文化新军的最伟大最英雄的旗手！”
    不过，因为大部分文化工作者出身小资产阶级知识分子，在当时，对于自己思想意识改造的觉悟程度不够，一方面又遭受到反动统治者残酷的镇压，也确实限制了他们与工农群众的结合。例如革命文艺运动，喊了十多年的大众化也不能得到解决，实际上局限于小资产阶级，造成了革命文艺运动最严重的缺点。
    五四以来的新文化运动是有其伟大的成绩。但如果到现在还不能解决这个基本问题：与工农结合，为工农兵服务，这运动就不可能再向前推进一步！在毛主席文艺座谈会的讲话以后，解放区的文艺活动的蓬勃发展，就是一个很好的证明，比如就边区来讲，我们的农民作家赵树理同志如此辉煌的成就，为解放区文艺界大放光彩，提供了值得我们很好学习的方面。尤其是经过土地改革，广大群众翻身后展开自唱自乐的文艺运动大踏步地走进文艺领域来，带来了一片新气象！而前线战斗中也还有自士兵群众中生长起来的，象李文波营长那样优秀的通讯员……这种种事实，都足以证明与工农兵群众结合后的新文化、新文艺一定有非常烂灿的前途！
    但我们现在还更须要时刻警惕，今天文化界及文艺界的同志们，在面向工农兵、与工农兵结合这一点上是否作得很好呢？思想上对这一点又是否完全认识得很清楚呢？不会的，尤其对于知识分子文化工作者来讲，这原是一个长期改造的过程。
    毛主席早在三九年，在五四运动纪念文上就如此严重地指出过：“……知识分子如果不与工农民众相结合，则将一事无成，辛亥革命与五四运动的失败，就是这个原因！革命的、或不革命的、或反革命的知识分子之最后的分界，看其是否并且实行结合工农民众，他们最后分界仅仅是在这一点……”
    今天我们来纪念五四及文艺节，回忆过去的历史，特别经过毛主席那样明确指出了五四运动的历史教训，返顾今天解放区文化工作的一番新气象，再展望前途，当应如何努力前进呵！
    纪念五四，我们要承继五四这伟大光荣的任务，我们要真正作为彻底的不妥协的反帝反封建而奋斗到底！如毛主席对文化工作人员所说的：“到民众中去，变成民众的宣传者与组织者！”
    特务头子的蒋介石末日快到了，纪念五四，还应该不要忘记他绞杀文化先烈的这一笔血债，鲁迅先生有句名言：“血债要用同物来偿还！”今天，我们的笔杆是与枪杆结合着的，我们相信蒋介石这笔血债一定能得到清算的！
    边区文化界，文艺工作者全体同志们，为建立独立和平民主的新中国而努力罢，为建立人民大众的新文化而努力罢，胜利一定是我们的。
