Taihang Northern Henan Frontline慰问团 (Comfort Group)
    Presents Banner to General Liu Bocheng as a Tribute
    Takes Large Quantities of慰劳品 (Comfort Items) to the Frontlines to Support the Troops
    [Our Newspaper, Northern Henan Frontline, 6th dispatch] The frontline慰问团 (comfort group), representing the six million people of the Taihang region, arrived at the front on May 1st. They brought sixty large carts of慰劳品 (comfort items) and a large number of letters of慰问 (condolences/support). On the 3rd, the group paid respects to General Liu Bocheng in a certain location, presenting him with a red banner embroidered with the four characters "常胜将军" (Ever-Victorious General). Student representatives and women representatives pinned red flowers on the General's chest, the flowers embroidered with the General's name and the respect of millions of people. Representatives of the慰问团 (comfort group) repeatedly expressed the people's respect for the General and wished him good health. General Liu immediately responded with humility and kindness, thanking the representatives of the慰问团 (comfort group), saying: "The victories of the past few months are due to the front fulfilling its due responsibility, but the officers and soldiers at the front dare not take credit. This is the merit of the people." "The efforts of the people in the rear have given the troops infinite encouragement. Seeing you is like seeing family. I hope that the front and rear will be more united and work hard to achieve victory." The next day, the directly subordinate units held a discussion meeting, inviting comrades from the慰问团 (comfort group) to speak. They reported on the situation of preferential treatment for military families in the rear, hoping that the officers and soldiers at the front would focus on killing the enemy. In the evening, the Taihang Democratic Theater Troupe performed "The White-Haired Girl" to add to the festivities. The慰问团 (comfort group) is scheduled to go to the front on the 3rd to慰问 (express sympathy and support) the various units. (Shen Rong)
