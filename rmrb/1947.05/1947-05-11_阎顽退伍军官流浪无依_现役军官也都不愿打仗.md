　　According to Xu Gan, a demobilized officer of the 37th Division of Yan Xishan's army in Liangjia Lane, Quwo City: Over 7,000 demobilized officers of Yan Xishan's army are wandering the streets of Taiyuan and Linfen, relying on their wives and daughters to sell their bodies to survive. In March of this year, surplus officers of Yan's army were still making a living by selling peanuts, cigarettes, and pulling rickshaws. Later, due to the continuous rise in prices, with each pound of flour rising to 2,000 yuan and a bucket of water costing 500 yuan, their lives became desperate, and they had no choice but to send their wives and daughters to brothels. For example, Wang Dingfang, a battalion commander of the First Battalion of the Second Regiment of the 37th Division, and Li Cai, a company commander of the same battalion, both rented out their beloved wives to brothels in Taiyuan's Sidao Lane for a monthly fee of 50,000 yuan. In Linfen, every evening, gorgeously dressed active-duty officers chase after the wives and daughters of demobilized officers on the streets. A certain unemployed major general pulls a rickshaw in Taiyuan City with a large portrait of "Yan the Fourth" on his back. Someone asked him, "Why do you carry the chairman's portrait on your back?" He replied, "I have no home, no room, and nowhere to put it now, so I have to carry it with me." This kind of dissatisfaction has even affected active-duty officers and soldiers. Slogans are often found written in chalk on the streets, such as "Victory in the War of Resistance, go home and sell land," "Success in the War of Resistance, lose both people and property," and "You give me sixty percent of the supplies, I'll fight sixty percent of the battle."
    【Taiyue, This Newspaper, 9th Dispatch】During the battles in southern Shanxi, the People's Liberation Army seized many private letters from Kuomintang government and military officials, which were filled with widespread depression and unease. Wu Xizhou, the Kuomintang magistrate of Shangqiu County, Henan, wrote to Wei, the company commander of the light and heavy weapons company of the 67th Brigade of the 30th Division, on March 7: "Respectfully, Brother Yan: Since assuming the post of county magistrate, I have been sued by party bullies and local tyrants and the matter is still unresolved. In addition, the political situation in eastern Henan is extremely chaotic, and I have lost all interest in officialdom." A friend of Yan Dezhi, the regimental commander of the 199th Regiment of the 67th Brigade, wrote from Zhenjiang: "The current political situation is extremely unstable. The Taiwan incident is very serious, and Nanjing, Pukou, and Wuhu are in chaos, with people full of grievances. Today's newspaper reported that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov suggested resolving the China issue at the Moscow Four Foreign Ministers Conference. I don't know if China's fate will be resolved this time." The letter also warned Yan, saying: "The 51st Division was completely annihilated in Zaozhuang, and Hao Pengju was 'reformed' but then executed again. You should be cautious." Liang Zhenlin, the company commander of the machine gun company of the 67th Brigade, wrote to Luo Xienda, the brigade commander of the 13th Brigade of the 66th Division, saying: "The × division has launched two assaults, and the losses are almost complete. Deputy Brigade Commander Chen Chengwu was captured, and there are very few old classmates left. Under the so-called nationalization of the army, the × division was forced to go north, making it impossible for us to gain a foothold." Chen Lianzhen, of the political department of the 27th Brigade of the 30th Division, wrote to the camp commander of the Supervisory Camp of the Eighth Supply District in Lanzhou, saying: "Comrades are mostly very anxious, because they have no heart for work and cannot leave even if they want to. Everyone is depressed and listless."

    【本报太岳九日电】据曲沃城内梁家巷阎顽三十七师退伍军官许干谈：阎顽七千余退伍军官流浪太原、临汾街头，依靠妻女卖淫渡日。今年三月，阎军编余军官，尚以卖花生、纸烟、拉洋车谋生，后因物价不断上涨，每斤面涨至二千元，买担水也得五百元，生活陷入绝境不得不把妻女送入妓院。如编余的三十七师二团一营营长王定方，与该营一连连长李采都把爱妻出租给太原四道巷妓院，每月身价五万元。临汾每至傍晚，衣服华丽的现役军官在街头追逐者，皆为退伍军官的妻女。某失业少将在太原市上拉洋车，背上背着“阎老四”大像，有人问他：“你为什么背上会长的像，”他说：“我现在无家无室无处放，只得随身带上。”此种不满情绪甚至波及现役军官与士兵，街上常发现粉笔写的标语，如“抗战胜利，回家卖地。”“抗战成功，人财两空。”“你发六成给养，我打六成仗。”
    【本报太岳九日电】晋南战斗中，人民解放军缴获不少蒋家军政官员的私人信件，其中充满着普遍的颓丧与不安。国民党河南商邱县长吴锡周三月七日致三十师六十七旅轻重营魏连长的信中称：“遵颜表弟：初任县长，被党棍土劣控诉至今未了，加以豫东政局纷乱不堪，兄已无心仕途。”六、七旅一九九团团长阎德治之友人由镇江来信说：“现在政局极端不安，台湾事件闹得很严重，南京、浦口、芜湖混乱不堪，人民怨声载道。今日报载莫斯科四外长会议苏外长莫洛托夫建议解决中国事件，不知中国命运会不会在这次得到解决。”信中并警告阎说：“五十一师在枣庄全军覆没，郝鹏举‘反正’后又被执，兄当慎重。”六、七旅机炮连连长梁珍琳致六六师十三旅旅长罗贤达信说：“×师两度突击，损耗几尽，陈副旅长诚武被虏，旧有同学寥寥无几。在所谓军队国家化之下，×师被迫北上，使吾辈无法立足矣。”三十师二十七旅政治部陈廉正致兰州第八补给区监护营营长信称：“各同志多甚彷徨，盖工作无心，欲去不能，大家精神沮丧，痿靡失常。”
