　　People's Art and Literature Troupe Established
　　The People's Art and Literature Troupe was formally established on the 15th of last month. It is a comprehensive artistic group composed of famous artists from various regions. The members of the working committee include Comrades Liu Yangmin, Liu Yumin, Shao Wei, Ma Da, Shi Ping, Hong Zheng, and Lu Su. The working committee has four groups under it: literature, drama, music, and fine arts. In less than a month since the troupe's establishment, the literature group has rewritten one script and created another. It is now collaborating with the music group on frontline songs. In addition to co-sponsoring the "People's Daily Pictorial" with the Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the People's Daily, the fine arts group has also made many handicrafts (such as portraits of Chairman Mao, Red Stars, etc.). It is now preparing to paint foreign films. The drama group has performed eight times, and the plays "Zhou Zishan" and "Receiving the Special Commissioner" have been warmly welcomed by the masses.
　　However, as the group is newly established, it has not yet established close ties with various cultural organizations. It is hoped that all drama troupes, propaganda teams, and cultural organizations will communicate more, especially to send more materials and related printed matter.

　　人民文艺工作团成立
    人民文艺工作团业于上月十五日正式成立，它是由各地来的著名艺术工作者，所组成的综合性的艺术团体。工作委员会委员有刘仰民、刘郁民、邵惟、马达、史平、洪征、卢肃等七同志，工委会下设文学、戏剧、音乐、美术四组。该团成立不及一月，文学组即改写了一个剧本，创作了一个剧本；现又和音乐组合作前线歌曲。美术组除和文联、人民日报合办“人民日报画刊”外；还做了不少工艺品（如毛主席像、红星等）；现又筹备画洋片。戏剧组曾演出八次，所演“周子山”“接受大员”等剧，均受群众热烈欢迎。
    惟团体新成立，尚未与各文化团体取得密切联系，希各剧团、宣传队、各文化团体多多通讯，特别希望多多寄些材料及有关之各种印刷物。
