Why Submit Articles
    Song Qi's Posthumous Work

    I submit articles for two reasons. One is that I see that everyone, comrades, are also soldiers. They go to the front lines to strike the enemy. The leaders ask me to guard the luggage in the rear, and I feel very ashamed. The other is that, objectively, the comrades serve the masses and contribute their efforts, and I want to tell everyone about their heroic and exemplary deeds.

    Masses' Reactions After Publication

    The published stories of heroes and models make people feel that the higher-ups have the vision to not bury merit, and everyone is very envious, unconsciously emulating the heroes. This makes everyone eager for the newspaper. So, I take the opportunity to read the newspaper to the comrades anytime, anywhere, but before reading it, I read it through once myself to avoid stumbling (meaning encountering roadblocks) during the reading. However, when reading the newspaper, avoid reading international and domestic news first. Start with what is in front of you, such as the newspaper of our regiment and the small newspaper of the brigade, and then talk about domestic and international news. The reading time should not be too long.

    How Submitting Articles Helps Me

    Because of submitting articles, I have learned some experience and helped the cadres to easily understand the lower levels and improve my own cultural level.

    The number of articles submitted, from the Battle of Qi County to now, is fifteen. The titles, times, and places are not written in detail (see my introduction in the Hero Meeting).

    Experience in Submitting Articles

    When interviewing for articles, it should be compiled from the reports of platoon and squad leaders, as well as materials from the individuals and the masses. The published articles must suit the tastes of the masses. In addition, you can also induce the collection of articles. This is best done on the march, talking about stories and telling jokes, consciously talking about the heroic and exemplary deeds of other regiments from the side. By talking like this, he can adopt other people's experiences to improve himself. In addition, he may also say that we have a lot of things like this in our group. Secondly, we must also take care of everyone, such as writing letters, teaching him to recognize new characters (such as new character cards, new character plaques). New characters must be linked to his life, learning what he does. Everyone should have one new character card, and it should be rotated once a day. When exchanging, the platoon and squad leaders should check to see if they can recognize, write, and speak.

### 为啥要投稿

专栏：宋琦遗

　　为啥要投稿
    宋琦遗作
    我的投稿有两种原因，一是看到大家同志们也是个兵，他们去前线上打击敌人，首长叫我在后边看守行李，我感到非常惭愧，另外客观上大家同志为群众服了务，出了力，自己就想把他们的英雄模范事迹告给大家。
    登报后的群众反映
    已登出来的英雄模范，感觉到上级有眼力不埋没功劳，大家都很羡慕，无意中向英雄们看齐。这样大家就对报有了渴望，于是我趁机给同志们随时随地读报，但在未读报前预先对报上先读一遍，以免读时打圪瘩，（有拦路虎之意），可是读报忌先读国际、国内，应先从眼前边开始，如本团的报和旅的小报，以后再谈国内消息国际消息。读报时间不可过长。
    投搞对自己的帮助
    因为投稿，使自己揣摸了一些经验，并且帮助了干部，容易了解下层，提高自己的文化。
    投稿的数目，自从杞县战斗到现在，投了十五篇，题目、时间、地点不再详写，（参看群英会我的介绍书）。
    投稿的经验
    采访稿子，应从排班长汇报中，及其他本人和群众三方面材料而编成，报登出来一定要适合群众的口味，另外还可以引诱收集稿子，这个最好在行军路中一面谈故事，一面拉笑话，有意识的从侧面谈别团的英雄模范事迹，这样一谈他可以采取人家经验提高自己。另外他也可能谈说像这样的事情咱组里有的是。其次还要照顾大家，如写信，教他认生字，（如生字片，生字牌），生字一定要联系他生活，做啥学啥，生字片的应用每人要有一个，一天轮流换一次。交换时，班排长要检查，看是否认会、写会、讲会。
