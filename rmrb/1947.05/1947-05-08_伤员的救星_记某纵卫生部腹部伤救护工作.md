　　Savior of the Wounded
    A Record of Abdominal Wound Care by a Certain Column's Health Department
    Zhang Zhan
    Abdominal wounds are very serious injuries, and abdominal surgery is one of the most complex and meticulous surgical procedures. Patients who have undergone abdominal surgery require the most quiet rest and excellent nursing care and treatment.

    In previous battles, the Health Department of Column × made continuous efforts to treat such wounded. However, due to the great mobility of the war, with large-scale advances and retreats, the transfer to rear hospitals posed a great threat to the lives of abdominal surgery patients. Everyone could only put them on stretchers with infinite regret and pity. Although the porters were repeatedly and carefully told everything to pay attention to along the way, they were always worried and sweating for them.

    The problem was finally solved. At a cadre meeting of the 1036th Health Department, the following decision was made: Under no circumstances should abdominal surgery patients be transferred to other hospitals until their lives are guaranteed.

    At midnight on December 31st, the attack on × City began. Abdominal surgery patients were carried one by one into the well-prepared wards. The five nurses in the surgery team were busy with the operating room work, and the field hospital nurses were equally busy and unable to spare time. Therefore, seven young orderlies and some messengers and feeders were organized as nurses to care for these wounded. They took turns guarding the beds of the wounded with great enthusiasm and warmth. The number of wounded increased from three to five, and finally to eleven. They couldn't keep up with the shifts. Liu Jinwa, the squad leader of the service squad who was liberated from Dayang Lake, and six young orderlies from Zhangqiu who had just joined the army, simply moved into the ward and took care of them day and night, persisting for six days and six nights. In this work, the Chen brothers (Chen Shiyuan, Chen Shikui) and Liu Jinwa emerged as three outstanding models.

    After the surgery was completed, everyone breathed a sigh of relief. On the evening of the 6th, they received an order that the Chiang Kai-shek's 71st Division, 140th Brigade, which came all the way from Taiwan to aid Jinxiang, had been surrounded by us in the suburbs of Yutai. The column's health department must immediately depart for a certain place to receive the wounded. The task was urgent. In order to realize the original plan, half a section was left behind to convalesce and care for these eleven abdominal surgery patients.

    The annihilation battle on the outskirts of Yutai ended victoriously. For several days, it snowed heavily, and dark clouds loomed. Due to the dim light, the operating room worked under gas lamps day and night. They didn't know day and night. When eating, they forgot whether they were eating breakfast or lunch. For two days and two nights, they only ate and worked, without rest or sleep.

    Zhou Dongzhen, a soldier from the 1st Company, 1st Battalion of Regiment ××, was injured by a bullet, which penetrated his muscles and bones, passed through the diaphragm, and shattered his spleen. Minister Zhan – the all-rounder in charge of abdominal surgery – although he successfully removed the injured's entire spleen, sutured the diaphragm, and tidied up the entire wound, the injured's life was still under serious threat of death.

    Comrade Ma Ning, the deputy head of Regiment ××, was carried into the operating room. When Minister Zhan performed the laparotomy and discovered that his intestines had been hit with fifteen holes, everyone felt in their hearts that his life was probably hopeless. Although it took three hours to suture all the wounds, they feared that they could only save his life by one in ten thousand.

    In this battle, another nine abdominal surgery patients remained in the column's health department for post-operative treatment. The young orderlies ran back and forth in the ice, snow, and mud, acting as their temporary nurses.

    Late on the 10th, they received instructions from their superiors that Zhang Lanfeng's troops had arrived in Tianji, and the troops were about to enter battle. The column's health department immediately moved to × to receive the wounded.

    In an environment where mass conditions were very difficult, nine stretchers were mobilized to carry nine abdominal wound patients, following the column's health department through the wild and cold winter night in the ice and snow, marching north.

    The enemy reinforcements were annihilated in Yangzhuang area southwest of Jinxiang. At dawn on the 13th, the wounded soldiers who needed surgery had been carried one by one into the courtyard of the operating room. After thirty-four surgeries were completed, five abdominal surgery patients were left for post-operative care.

    Comrade Ji Qiuzhe, the deputy squad leader of the 7th Company, 3rd Battalion of Regiment ××, was shot through the muscles and bones and the diaphragm, and the bullet entered his lungs. He felt that his life would not last long. When Minister Zhan opened his abdomen, removed the muscles and bones, and took out the bullet from the bottom of the lower lobe of his left lung, it was not until he slept in the ward for a few days that he realized that his life would undoubtedly be saved again.

    One comrade after abdominal surgery was bleeding too much. Li Yuxi, a nurse in the surgery team, transfused 300cc (about a small porcelain bowl) of his own fresh blood to him. When Comrade Li felt a headache and dizziness, and his young, rosy face showed a pale color, everyone asked him to rest, but he refused everyone's request and continued to insist on working. Comrade Song Yuankui, the nurse in charge of boiling and disinfecting surgical instruments, had not rested for several days and nights. His eyes were so smoked by the smoke and fire that he could not open them, but he still persisted until the end.

    Doctor Su Di, who was in charge of post-operative treatment, was constantly walking out of this ward and drilling into that ward, examining the changes in the symptoms of each treated wounded and giving explanations and treatments.

    In the short period of ten days, after six large-scale battles were fought continuously in the Jinxiang and Yutai areas, the war came to an end. The rescue work was also successfully completed with the concerted efforts of everyone. Although the rescue position was constantly moving rapidly with the mobility of the war, the transfer of the heavy twenty-five abdominal surgery patients, according to the original plan, was finally completed without transferring a single one to the rear hospital.

    Minister Zhan and other comrades often went to the ward to see these wounded who had been rescued from the brink of death. Once, when asked about the symptoms of Comrade Zhou Dongzhen, whose spleen had been removed, he received Comrade Zhou's loud reply: "I'm better!"

    The twenty-five wounded were getting better day by day, and their lives had been absolutely guaranteed.

    The troops received the task of continuing to march south for a long-distance expedition. At dusk on the 24th, when these twenty-five wounded were carried onto stretchers, they were filled with infinite gratitude and reluctance. In the vast night, they set off on the road to the rear hospital. Minister Zhan and Director Bai of Surgery received a letter from Comrade Ma Ning, the deputy head of Regiment Ma Ning, whose intestines had been hit with fifteen holes, on March 11, which stated:

    "…I am still alive, and even living better. I have gained weight. I can slowly walk two li without crutches. I am in very good spirits. I cannot help but thank you very much… I will be discharged from the hospital in at most one month…"

    When everyone saw this letter from the wounded, they couldn't help but rejoice and dance, celebrating Comrade Ma Ning's new life, celebrating their own day and night work results, and celebrating the valuable experience gained in exchanging anything for the lives of abdominal wound patients.

　　伤员的救星
    记某纵卫生部腹部伤救护工作
    张展
    腹部伤是很严重的创伤，施行腹部手术也是最复杂最细密的一种手术，腹部手术后的伤员又是最需要安静休养及很好护理治疗的一种伤员。
    历次作战中，×纵卫生部曾经不断努力于此种伤者的治疗，但由于战争的运动性太大，大踏步的前进与后退，往后方医院的转运，便使手术后腹部伤员们的生命遭受极大的威胁，大家只有抱了无限的遗憾与怜惜，把他们放上转运担架，虽然一再详细的告诉抬担架的老乡们在途中应注意的一切事项，但总是不放心的为他们捏着一把汗。
    问题终于解决了。在一○三六卫生部的一次干部会上，做出了这样的决定——无论如何，要把腹部手术的伤员，留在本部治疗，直到他的生命得到保障后才能转院。
    十二月三十一日午夜开始了攻击×城，施行腹部手术的伤员一个一个的抬入了已安置好的病房，手术组的五个看护，忙着手术室的工作，野战医院的看护，同样忙的抽不出来，于是把七个小勤务员及一些通信员饲养员组织起来，作为护理这些伤员的看护员了。他们都非常积极热情的轮流守护在伤员的床边，伤员由三个五个最后增到十一个，换班是换不过来了，从大杨湖解放过来的勤务班长刘金娃和参军不久的六个张秋的小勤务员，干脆都搬到病房里住下来，不分昼夜的照护着，一直坚持了六天六夜。在这件工作中，出现了陈家弟兄（陈士元、陈士魁）和刘金娃三个特出的模范。
    手术做完了，大家才缓过一口气来。六日晚，接到了命令，从台湾远道来援金乡之蒋军整七十一师一四○旅，已被我围于鱼台城郊，纵卫须立即出发前往某地接受伤员，任务是急迫的，为实现原订计划，留下了半个所来后疗与护理这十一个腹部手术后的伤员。
    鱼台外围的歼灭战胜利的结束了。几天来大雪飘飘，阴云密布，因光线阴暗，手术室内不分昼夜的都在汽灯下工作着，他们不知道白天与黑夜，吃饭时，他们忘掉了吃的是早饭、午饭，一连两天两夜，他们只有吃饭和工作，没有休息与睡眠。
    ××团一营一连战士周东珍被弹伤筋骨，穿过横隔膜而把脾脏打的破烂不堪。詹部长——腹部手术的包办者，虽然很好的把伤者的脾脏全部摘出，缝合了横隔膜，以至把整个伤口收拾好了，但伤者的生命，还是处在严重的死的威胁中。
    ××团的副团长马宁同志，抬进了手术室来，当詹部长施以开腹而发现其肠子被打了十五个窟窿时，大家内心都同感到恐怕生命难保，虽然经过了三个钟头的时间，把一切创伤都缝合好了，但亦恐只能挽救其生命于万一。
    此次战斗又有九个腹部手术后的伤员，留在纵卫做手术后的治疗了，小勤务员又在冰雪泥泞中跑来跑去充任其临时的看护员。
    十日深后，又接到上级指示，张岚峰部已到田集，部队即将进入战斗，纵卫立即移向×地接收伤员。
    在群众条件非常困难的环境下，动员了九付担架，抬着九个腹部伤员，随着纵卫在冰雪中遍野严寒的冬夜，向北行进了。
    援敌被歼于金乡西南之杨庄一带，十三日拂晓，需动手术的伤兵已一个一个的抬到手术室的院里，三十四个手术做完后，又把五个腹部伤员留下后疗了。
    ××团三营七连副班长季秋则同志，被子弹击穿筋骨及横隔膜而打入肺部，他已感到自己的生命不长久了，当詹部长给他开腹切除筋骨从左肺下叶底部把枪弹取了出来，以至他睡到病室内几天以后，他才意识到自己的生命是确切无疑的将又会活下来。
    腹部手术后的一位同志，因流血过多，手术组看护栗玉玺同志，把自己三百ＣＣ（约一小洋磁碗）的鲜血输给他，当栗同志感到头痛眼晕，年青红润的脸皮现出惨白色时。大家要他休息，但他拒绝了大家的要求，继续坚持着工作，看护宋元魁同志担负着煮手术器械的消毒工作，几天几夜不休息了，眼睛被烟火熏的都睁不开了，但还是把工作坚持到最后。
    担负手术后疗的医生苏棣同志，无时不在从这个病房走出来又钻进那个病房去，诊视每一个留治伤员症状的变化，予以解释和治疗。
    短短的十几天中，在金乡、鱼台地区连续进行了大规模的六次战斗后，战争告一段落了，救护工作在大家同心协力的努力下，亦已胜利完成了，救护位置虽然随着战争的运动性也在不断急速的运动，但转运沉重的二十五个腹部手术后的伤员，按照原订计划，终于一个也未转往后方医院。
    詹部长和其他同志经常到病房去看这些从死亡边缘上挽回的伤员，有一次问到那个脾脏摘出的周东珍同志的症状时，他得到周同志响亮的回答——“好了”。
    二十五个伤员一天天好起来，生命上已得到了绝对的保证。
    部队又受领了继续南下远征的任务，当二十四日薄暮，把这二十五个伤员抬上担架时，他们满怀着无限感激与依依不舍的心，在夜色苍茫中，向后方医院的路途中进发了，詹部长、白手术主任接得了曾经在肠子上打了十五个窟窿的副团长马宁同志三月十一日的来信，内称：
    “………我还活着，并还活的更好，吃胖了，不靠拐子可慢慢走二里路，精神非常愉快，这不能不万分感谢你们………。我最多一个月即可出院……。”
    当大家看到这封伤者的来信，不禁高兴的手舞足蹈，庆祝着马宁同志新的生命，庆祝着自己日以继夜的工作成果，庆祝着获得了用什么换得腹部伤员生命的宝贵经验。
