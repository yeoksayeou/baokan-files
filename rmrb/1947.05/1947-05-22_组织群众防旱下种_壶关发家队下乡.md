　　Organizing the Masses for Drought Prevention and Sowing
    Huguan's Prosperous Home Team Goes to the Countryside
    [Report from this newspaper in Huguan] In order to prevent drought and advance sowing, Huguan specially convened a meeting on May 11th with over a hundred primary school teachers and cadres from the new district, organizing a "Prosperous Home Team" to go to the countryside and mobilize the masses to rush to sow. After two days of study, the tasks of the Prosperous Home Team were clarified: 1. Organize all available labor to strive to complete sowing before Lesser Fullness [a solar term, around May 21st], ensuring that not a single mu of land is left uncultivated. 2. Inspect the cultivation on behalf of military families, martyrs' families, and personnel participating in the war, and organize rapid sowing for them. 3. Combine the rush to sow with checking and resolving outstanding issues in land investigation. Organizationally, the team was divided into two units, with subgroups established to focus on specific tasks. The approach was to accurately calculate labor based on existing conditions and implement large-scale mutual aid and labor exchange. Before departure, Comrade Jia, the county party secretary, and County Head Wang both provided in-depth mobilization and encouragement, raising everyone's spirits. They have now gone to various villages to carry out the rush-to-sow campaign. (Zeng Ji, De Fu, Ru Long)
