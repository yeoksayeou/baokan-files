　　Military Reporter of a Certain Unit,
    Comrade Song Qi Gloriously Sacrifices His Life
    [Reported from the Yu-North Front, this newspaper, 8th] Comrade Song Qi, a military reporter of a certain unit under the 1036th Unit of the Frontline Field Army, gloriously sacrificed his life while conducting interviews on the front lines during the battle on the outskirts of Jixian County. Comrade Song Qi was from Taihua Village, Shexian County, Henan Province. He joined the army in early 1944 and was a Communist Party member. At the start of the battle, he was with the soldiers on the front lines, holding a gun, lying in the fortifications for a day and a night. He was wounded on April 2nd, but he insisted on not leaving the front lines. Unfortunately, another bullet struck his heart, and Comrade Song Qi shed his last drop of blood for the people. When medic Ren Qingshan braved the artillery fire to rescue him, he found his diary and unfinished manuscript beside him, already stained with blood. All the commanders and fighters in his battalion felt deep sorrow upon hearing of Comrade Song Qi's death.

　　某部随军记者
    宋琦同志光荣殉国
    【本报豫北前线八日电】前线野战兵团一零三六部某部随军记者宋琦同志，在汲县外围作战时，在火线上进行采访，不幸光荣牺牲。宋琦同志河南涉县台华村人，一九四四年初入伍，系共产党员。战斗开始时，在火线上他与战士在一起，拿着枪，伏在工事里坚持了一昼夜。四月二日他挂了彩，他坚持不下火线，不幸又一颗子弹打进他的心口，宋琦同志乃为人民流尽了最后一滴血。当卫生员任庆善冒着炮火去救护他时，见到他的日记本和尚未写成的稿子，还留在他的身旁，已经染上了鲜血。他那个营里的全体指战员听到宋琦同志的死，莫不痛惜。
