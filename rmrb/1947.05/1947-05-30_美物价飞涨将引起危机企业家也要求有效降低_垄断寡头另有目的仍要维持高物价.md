Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, May 28th: TASS, New York: The problem of US prices has aroused increasing concern among the American people in the past few weeks. Although the Industrialists Association insisted that the rapid increase in the production of daily necessities would lead to a reduction in prices after the government's price controls were lifted last summer, prices never continued to fall, but have continued to rise in the past few months. The Washington Bureau of Labor Statistics recently reported that US prices have reached their highest peak in the past twenty-seven years. According to the Wall Street Journal, most of the price increases occurred after price controls were lifted. On the one hand, it has drastically increased industrial profits, with their profits reaching a record of 1.5 trillion yuan last year; on the other hand, it has reduced people's purchasing power and reduced consumption. As early as February, the Congress of Industrial Organizations issued a statement criticizing the policy of the House of Representatives, which pointed out: The continued increase in the prices of necessities is having a bad impact on the living standards and health of the American people. Truman admitted in his speech on April 21 that the continued increase in prices has worsened the situation of millions of American families. Truman said that the continued rise in prices and excessive prices will result in decline and depression. The current situation has aroused deep panic among many groups in the business community. On May 5th, an entrepreneurial group sent a letter to industrialists requesting them to reduce prices automatically. The request stated: Retail transactions have begun to decline, and the current accumulation of goods has aroused panic. If prices are not reduced in an organized manner and on a wider scale, industrialists should be held responsible for the imminent crisis. Signatories include Wilson, general manager of General Electric, and Storr, deputy general manager of American Aluminum Company, and others. The reduction in demand caused by high prices has already produced some signs of industrial stagnation. According to the monthly industrial production index published by the Federal Reserve, industrial output in March did not exceed that in February, while previous output was increasing rapidly and significantly. The "Economic Intelligence" bulletin recently pointed out when pointing out the increasing disparity between wages and prices: This is a weakness in our situation. The total value of retail transactions has increased, while the actual total amount of transactions is still decreasing. As a result, a large number of goods are sent directly from factories to warehouses for storage. Although there are various reliable signs of economic recession, as evidenced by the recent "undertow" in the New York Stock Exchange, American monopolists apparently still want to maintain high prices. At the New York Business Conference, the vice chairman of the conference, Schlieff, said: Using normal economic methods plus a moderate stagnation can prevent prices from rising. Many observers pointed out that the representatives of financial capital obviously do not mind "moderate recession," which would destroy companies that emerged during the war other than syndicates, and produce a huge reserve army of unemployed, thereby weakening the labor movement. This is the real purpose of the unprecedented bill passed by Congress that restricts the rights of American trade unions. The reduction of workers' actual wages caused by the continued rise in prices has caused fierce strike movements. According to the Associated Press, huge conflicts will soon occur in the coal and construction industries, in railways and maritime transportation. Twenty-two railway workers' trade unions have requested an increase in wages of two corners per hour and requested overall collective bargaining on a national scale. Recently, strikes have occurred in steel mills in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Jersey, and Ohio. Newspapers predict that a new wave of strikes will sweep the country.
Another dispatch: According to Washington news: Due to soaring prices, Truman has ordered Agriculture Minister Anderson to convene a meeting of agricultural and financial leaders to discuss the establishment of a plan to curb soaring prices.

### 美物价飞涨将引起危机企业家也要求有效降低　垄断寡头另有目的仍要维持高物价

　　美物价飞涨将引起危机企业家也要求有效降低
  　垄断寡头另有目的仍要维持高物价
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】塔斯社纽约讯：过去数周中，美国物价问题激起美国广大民众的日益关心。虽然去夏政府的物价管制取销后，工业家组合公司硬说日用品的迅速增产将引起物价的减低，然而物价决未继续下降，过去数月却增涨不已。华盛顿劳动统计局最近报告，美国物价已达过去二十七年的最高峰。据华尔街公报，物价多系在物价管制取销后上涨的。一方面使工业的利润急剧增加，他们去年的利润达一百五十万万元的纪录；另一方面却使人民购买力降低和减少了消费量。早在二月间产业职工会联合会就发表了文告，批评众议院的政策，其中指出：目前继续增高的必需品之价格，给美国人民的生活水准和健康以坏的影响。杜鲁门在其四月廿一日的演说中承认物价的继续增高使美国数百万家庭的景况变坏。杜鲁门说，物价的继续高涨与过高的价格，结果是衰微萧条。目前的情况在企业界许多的集团间激起了深刻的惊慌。五月五日某企业家集团致函工业家要求其自动减价。该请求书称：零售交易开始下降，而目前货物的堆积却又激起了惊慌。设非物价在有组织的状态下和更广泛的范围内降低，则工业家们应负迫在眉睫的危机之责任。签字者中有通用电气公司总经理威尔逊，美国铝公司副总经理斯托尔等。物价腾贵引起的需求的降低早已产生了一些工业停滞的征兆，根据联邦贮藏局发表的每月工业生产指数，三月份的工业产量并未超过二月份的工业产量，而以前的产量却是迅速而显著地增加着的。《经济情报》公报最近于指出工资和物价日益悬殊时说：这是我们处境中的弱点。零售交易的价值总额已经增加，而实际的交易总额仍然在减少。结果，大量的商品都由工厂直接送到仓库中存起了。虽然有种种可靠的经济衰落迹象，已为最近纽约证券交易所的“暗潮”所证明，美国垄断家显然仍要维持高物价。在纽约商务会议上，大会副主席薛里夫说：用通常的经济方法加上适度的滞歇就能使物价不致上涨。许多观察家指明：财政资本的代表们显然是不会介意“适度的衰落”的，这种衰落会毁灭辛迭加之外的战时兴起的各公司，并且产生庞大的失业后备军，从而削弱工人运动。这就是国会通过的史无先例的限制了美国职工会权利的法案的真正目的。物价继续不断的高涨所引致的工人实际工资的降低，引起了剧烈的罢工运动。据美联社报导：在煤矿和建筑工业中，在铁路和海上商运方面，很快的就会发生巨大的冲突。廿二个铁路工人职工会已经要求每小时增加工资二角。并要求在全国范围内作总的集体谈判。最近，宾夕法尼亚州、西佛吉尼亚州、祈泽西与俄亥俄州的炼钢厂已经发生罢工。各报纸预言，新的罢工浪潮将泛滥全国。
    另讯：据华盛顿消息：由于物价的飞涨，杜鲁门顷已命令农业部长安德逊召开农业与财政界领袖会，讨论成立制止物价飞涨之计划。
