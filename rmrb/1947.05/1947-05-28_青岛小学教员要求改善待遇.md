Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 26th. Following the strike by faculty and students at Shandong University in Qingdao, the city's primary school teachers and staff organized a federation to demand improved treatment and job security from the Chiang Kai-shek government. They also sent representatives to petition Li Xianliang, the Chiang Kai-shek mayor of Qingdao. Li severely reprimanded the primary school teachers and staff federation as an illegal organization, and berated the representatives, saying: "Salary levels are already prescribed and should not be stirred up for no reason." The representatives' petition yielded no results, so they issued a declaration to the public lodging a complaint. The declaration sorrowfully stated: "Primary school teachers are now struggling on the brink of starvation, working hard every day but unable to get enough to eat. This situation is unbearably painful!" The declaration also stated: "We are not begging for pity, but rather awakening the sympathy of society to give us assistance."

　　青岛小学教员要求改善待遇
    【新华社山东二十六日电】青岛继山东大学罢教罢课之后，全市小学教职员即组织联合会，向蒋记政府提出改善待遇，保障职业之要求，并推派代表职员向蒋记青岛市长李先良请愿。李竟严责小学教职员联合会为非法组织，并痛斥该代表等谓：“薪金等级自有规定，不得无事生非”。该会代表请愿无结果，乃发表宣言向社会控诉。宣言中沉痛地说：“现在的小学教师是在饥饿线上挣扎，每日辛劳不得一饱，此景此情不胜酸楚！”宣言并称：“不是乞求怜悯，而是唤起社会的同情，给我们以助力。”
