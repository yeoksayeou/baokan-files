　　The People's Daily stated in its inaugural editorial: "Serving the people wholeheartedly is the newspaper's policy and purpose." Over the past year, all the people of our Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Liberated Area, in order to strive for national peace and democracy, consolidate our democratic construction and the achievements of eight years of bloody war, have bravely stood up in self-defense and resolutely smashed the shameless attacks of Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous civil war. The astonishing achievements and brilliant results have inspired the people of the whole country, proving that the territory of the Republic of China will never allow any imperialists to invade, and the sovereignty of the Republic of China will never allow any traitors to steal it.
　　The liberated people of all strata, especially the peasants and workers who have been emancipated, already know that they are the sole masters of the Republic of China. It is impossible for the reactionary clique that harms the country and the people to continue to ride on the people's heads, exploiting and suppressing them.
　　The Liberated Areas are becoming increasingly prosperous, administrative efficiency is improving, military strength is growing, education is becoming widespread, the financial economy is developing smoothly, and labor production is in full swing, all thanks to the thorough implementation of "land to the tiller." However, the exchange of work experience between various departments, the introduction of typical examples in various tasks, the reporting of the international and domestic political situation, the exposure of the barbaric brutality of the dark rule, the inspiring of the people's enthusiasm for struggle, the raising of the masses' political awareness, and the promotion of the masses' path to production and national construction all depend on the People's Daily.
　　The People's Daily has become a beacon for the people of the Liberated Areas and a guide for all readers. It has truly accomplished the task of "serving the people wholeheartedly" and has achieved the purpose of "serving the people wholeheartedly." On the occasion of its anniversary, I would like to extend my sincere respect to all the staff of the People's Daily. Xing Zhaotang

　　People's Daily is the newspaper of the 30 million people in the border region. Over the past year, you have held high the torch of truth, supported national justice, smashed the fallacies of the reactionaries, reported correct news at home and abroad, and exchanged the experiences of production struggles throughout the border region, so that 30 million people, under your encouragement and education, are more united to build the border region, defend the border region, and smash the dark rule of the fascist reactionaries' traitorous, dictatorial, and civil war. Over the past year, your gradual growth and development is not only a symbol of the unprecedented strength of the people's power, but also an iron proof of the inevitable victory of the people's cause. On the occasion of the first anniversary of its publication, I would like to express my congratulations as a loyal reader, and wish you vigorous progress!
                                                    Gao Xiaoxun respectfully congratulates you

　　On the occasion of the first anniversary of the founding of the People's Daily, the vast number of readers have extended their warm congratulations. It describes the heroic struggles of the masses in the border region, and every mobilization call has played a great role in promoting them. This year's record is the crystallization of the people's blood and sweat, and the great victories and glorious achievements of the people of Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu over the past year are inseparable from the contribution of the People's Daily.
　　The People's Daily is the people's newspaper: First, it implements the Chinese Communist Party's policy of leading the people's revolution to the masses, organizes and guides the people's struggle, and serves the people's interests. Second, it is responsible to the people, consistent with the people, and all reports are truthful. Third, the battlefield reports of many frontline reporters and the local communications of the broad masses of people show that the news content is vivid facts and the source of news is mass-based. Fourth, it implements the guiding line of coming from the masses and going to the masses, commends typical examples, develops creativity, exchanges struggle experience, and the news itself has a high degree of guidance. Fifth, it has established a good distribution network with a large number of rural readers in the rural environment and inconvenient transportation. These characteristics are absolutely different from all anti-people newspapers, feudal groups or bourgeois newspapers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas.
　　Over the past year, the great victory of the people in the Liberated Areas is the victory of the patriotic self-defense war and the land reform. These two victories are mutually guaranteed and closely related. In the past year, the People's Daily has taken this as the center of reporting and guidance, and has promoted the related military training movement and production upsurge, and has made great contributions to the people. The People's Daily has done a good job in organizing various types of manuscripts in the editing, and the editorials, current affairs commentaries, comprehensive reports of international news and KMT-controlled area news, and the selection of materials for the supplements are all loved by the general public. The combination of simple maps and war reports, and the combination of reference materials and news are also very good.
　　Inspire combat, organize struggle, guide the people, and advance victoriously!
                                                    Liu Weicheng respectfully congratulates you

　　Recently, the People's Daily has improved in terms of striving for the timeliness of news, and we also hope to strengthen it further. The publication of war reports and important telegrams should not be delayed by more than two days. At present, the People's Liberation Army has won even greater victories on various battlefields, and the war situation is developing rapidly. The People's Daily has paid urgent attention to the communication and distribution work in the newly recovered areas, which is very important. Regarding how to establish democratic power and carry out mass work in the newly liberated areas, we hope to reflect it quickly. At the same time, under such circumstances, the crisis of the Chiang government has deepened, and political and economic chaos will inevitably increase in its ruling areas, and the opposition and resistance of the people to the dark tyranny will inevitably grow and become more acute; the ethnic minorities in the border areas may become conscious; and the US imperialist conspiracy to aid Chiang and Chiang Kai-shek's treasonous crimes may be staged differently. We hope to disclose more information in these areas in the future. We feel that there is very little coverage of the local situation in other Liberated Areas in the newspaper. Everyone is very unfamiliar with the land reform situation, people's conditions, transportation situation, economic and cultural trends, etc. in those places. We hope to expand the scope of reporting.
                                                        Kong Congzhou

### 人民日报创刊周年纪念祝词

　　人民日报创刊周年纪念祝词
    人民日报在发刊词上说：“全心全意为人民服务是本报的方针和宗旨。”一年来我晋冀鲁豫解放区全体人民，为了争取全国和平民主，巩固自己的民主建设与八年血战成果，挺身自卫，英勇地粉碎了蒋介石卖国内战的无耻进攻。惊人的战绩，辉煌的战果，振奋了全国人民，证明了中华民国的疆土，决不容任何帝国主义者所侵犯，中华民国的主权决不容任何卖国贼所窃卖。
    得到解放的各阶层人士，尤其是翻了身的农民和工人，已经知道他们是中华民国的唯一主人。祸国殃民的反动集团，妄想仍然骑在人民头上剥削镇压，那是永远不可能的。
    解放区日臻繁荣，行政效率提高，军事力量壮大，教育普及，财政经济之顺利发展，劳动生产之热烈运动，皆有赖于“耕者有其田”的贯彻执行。然交流各个部门的工作经验，介绍各个工作中的典型范例，报导国际国内的政治形势，揭发黑暗统治的野蛮残暴，启发人民的斗争热情，提高群众的政治觉悟，推动群众走上生产建国的道路，却有赖于人民日报。
    人民日报已成为解放区人民的灯塔与所有读者的指针。它真正完成了“全心全意为人民服务”的任务，达到了“全心全意为人民服务”的宗旨。兹值周年纪念，谨向人民日报全体工作者致以热忱的敬意。 邢肇棠
    人民日报，是边区三千万人民的报纸。一年来，你高擎着真理的火把，扶持民族正义，粉碎反动派谰言，报导国内外正确消息，交流全边区生产斗争的经验，使三千万人民在你的鼓舞与教育之下，更有力的团结起来，为建设边区、保卫边区、粉碎法西斯反动派卖国独裁内战的黑暗统治而奋斗不息。一年来，你的逐渐壮大与发展，不仅是人民力量空前强大的象征，也是人民事业必然胜利的铁证。今当出刊周年之际，特以一个忠实的读者资格，敬致贺忱，并祝猛进！
                                                    高校勋敬祝
    人民日报创刊一周年，广大读者都寄以热情的贺祝。它描述着边区群众的壮烈斗争，每一动员号召，都起了极大的推动作用。它这一年的纪录，是人民血汗斗争的结晶，而一年来晋冀鲁豫人民的伟大胜利和光荣成就，也与人民日报的贡献是分不开的。
    人民日报是人民的报纸：第一、它贯彻中国共产党领导人民革命的政策到群众中去，组织了指导人民的斗争，为人民利益而服务。第二、对人民负责，与人民一致，一切报导是真实的。第三、许多前线讯者的战地报导，广大群众的地方通讯，表现出新闻内容是活生生的事实，新闻来源是群众性的。第四、实行由群众中来到群众中去的指导路线，表扬典型，发挥创造，交流斗争经验，新闻本身具有高度的指导性。第五、在农村环境和交通不便的情况下，建立了很好的发行网，有广大的乡村读者。这些特点，和蒋管区内一切反人民的报纸，封建集团或资产阶级的报纸，都绝对不同。
    这一年来，解放区人民的伟大胜利，是爱国自卫战争和土地改革的胜利。这两种胜利是互相保证，密切关联。过去一年中，人民日报以此为报导和指导的中心，并推动与此相关的练兵运动与生产热潮，为人民立了大功。人民日报在编辑上把各类稿件组织得很好，所登社论、时事评述，采取综合报导的国际新闻及蒋管区新闻，副刊的选材，均为一般人所爱好。简图和战报的配合，参考资料和新闻的配合也是很好的。
    鼓舞战斗，组织斗争，引导人民，胜利前进！
                                                    刘威诚敬贺
    最近人民日报在争取新闻的时间性这一点上已有改进，我们还希望再予加强，战报和重要电讯的发表，应不迟过两日。目前各战场人民解放军更大获胜，战局发展很快，人民日报已紧急注意新收复区的通讯与发行工作，这是很重要的。关于新解放地区如何建立民主政权及开展群运工作，盼迅速反映。同时，在这样情况下，蒋政府危机加深，在其统治区内，政治经济势必更加混乱，人民与黑暗暴政的对立抗争势必更加滋长，更加尖锐；边疆少数民族可能走向觉悟；美帝国主义援蒋诡计和蒋介石卖国罪行或将另有演出。这些方面的消息，望今后多加披露。我们觉得，对于其他各解放区的地方情形，报上很少登载。那些地方的土地改革概况，人民状况、交通情形、经济、文化动态等，大家都很隔阂，希望扩大报导范围。
                                                        孔从周
