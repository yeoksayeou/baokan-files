　　[Special dispatch from the North Henan Front, May 6th] A certain unit of General Liu Bocheng's forces, besieging Tangyin, began shelling the city walls with dozens of large cannons at 6:00 AM on April 30th. The sound was like the earth splitting and the sky collapsing, and the smoke soared into the clouds, completely suppressing the enemy's firepower. The assault heroes of the 9th Company rapidly and bravely scaled the city walls, quickly advancing into the depth of the city. The Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops launched eleven counterattacks against us, resulting in fierce fighting throughout the night. The unit attacking the West Gate used heavy artillery to bombard the city gate. The next day (May 1st) at 4:00 AM, the city gate was breached, and the brave soldiers rushed in, encircling and annihilating the enemy who were fleeing to the southwest corner of the city. The battle was completely over at 5:00 AM.
　　[Special dispatch from the North Henan Front, May 5th] The two claws that the traitor Sun Dianying extended on the north and south sides of the western outskirts of Tangyin were eliminated by the People's Liberation Army before 24:00 on April 30th. The one in the northwest was the site of the ancient city of Tangyin, a strip of earthen embankment about 200 meters long from east to west and about 100 meters long from north to south. Sun Dianying had it built into an earthen寨, with fortifications both above and below ground, and a communication trench to the Xiaobeiguan, preventing the PLA in the northwest of the city from approaching the city wall. Sun Dianying used two battalions of troops, taking turns day and night, to counterattack from the earthen寨. The PLA outside the寨 fought the enemy in positions 30 meters apart. Both sides used hand grenades and automatic weapons. Although the enemy was in a commanding position and launched frantic counterattacks, the positions defended by our army never retreated an inch, holding firm for a week. When our army launched an offensive operation, it used extremely fierce firepower to completely destroy the north wall. The brave soldiers rushed in through the smoke. The puppet troops fled in panic, some fell to their deaths, and some were captured. More than 50 defeated soldiers in the southwest corner were buried underground, but were rescued by the PLA. According to prisoners, the battalion commander was killed, only one company commander escaped, and the other five were either wounded or killed. The other claw in the southwest was a large pillbox garrisoned by an entire company, equipped with a mortar. There was a secret ditch leading to the city behind the pillbox. When the PLA launched the siege, they bypassed the enemy's rear and dug another ditch to cut off the enemy's ditch. On the 28th, the PLA shot the cook who was delivering food to the enemy, cutting off their food supply. When the PLA launched the attack, the enemy in the pillbox cried out in despair: "We haven't had anything to eat or drink for two days, we won't fight anymore!" But the enemy still refused to surrender, and hid in the lowest level of the pillbox. The brave soldiers of the PLA climbed to the top of the pillbox and shouted, "Surrender and you will not be killed!" Only then did they very respectfully hand over their weapons. (Fang De)

　　漂亮的攻坚战
    方德
    【本报豫北前线六日电】围攻汤阴之刘伯承将军某部，于四月卅日六时开始以数十门大炮向城垣轰击，声如天崩地裂，硝烟耸入云霄，将敌火力完全压倒。该部九连之突击英雄迅速勇猛登上城墙，迅即向纵深发展；蒋伪军向我反复冲锋十一次，激战通宵。进攻西门之某部以重炮向城门猛轰，翌日（一日）四时城门洞开，勇士们争先跑步冲入，围歼向城西南角溃败之敌，五时完全结束战斗。
    【本报豫北前线五日电】汉奸孙殿英伸在汤阴西关南北两侧的两个爪子，在三十日二十四时以前就先后被解放军打掉。西北的一个是汤阴古城遗址，东西长二百米，南北长约一百米的一条土埂。孙殿英把它修成一座土寨，地上地下全有工事，还有通到小北关的交通壕，使在城西北的解放军不能接近城墙。孙殿英用两个营的兵力，不分昼夜轮番着从土寨里反扑，寨外解放军在相隔三十米的阵地里同敌人对战，双方使用手榴弹和自动火器，敌人虽居高临下，疯狂反扑，我军坚守的阵地始终未退出一寸，固守达一周之久。当我军发动攻击作战时、以极猛烈的火力彻底摧平其北面围墙，勇士们冒着硝烟冲入，伪军仓惶跳墙逃跑，有的跌死、有的被捉住，西南角的五十多个败兵被埋入地下，经解放军抢救刨出。据俘虏供：营长打死了，连长只有一个跑掉了，其余五个先后伤亡。西南的另一爪子是驻一个整连的大碉堡，还配属一门迫击炮，碉堡背面有一道通到城内的暗沟，解放军于开展围困作战时就向敌后背迂回，也挖了一道沟，把敌人的沟截断了，二十八日把敌人送饭的伙夫打死，食粮由此断绝，当解放军发动攻击时，碉堡里的敌人就发出哀告：“我们两天都没有吃喝，不打了！”但敌人仍不缴枪，钻到碉堡最下一层，解放军的勇士们爬到碉堡顶上，并高喊着“缴枪不杀！”这才很恭顺地把武器送出来。（方德）
