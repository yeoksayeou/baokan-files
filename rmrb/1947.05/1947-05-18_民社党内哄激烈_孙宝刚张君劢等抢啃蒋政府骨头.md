Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th: Shanghai News: Since the China Democratic Socialist Party (CDSP) joined the Chiang government, the infighting to grab at the scraps has intensified. Xu Fulin, the CDSP's Minister of Propaganda, told reporters on the 10th that only by re-electing the chairman and the Standing Committee, and reorganizing the CDSP, could there be any hope of resolving the disputes. Even before joining the "government," regarding the list of "National Government Committee" members, CDSP Standing Committee members Sun Baogang, Wang Shiming, and others opposed Zhang Junmai, claiming that the list was proposed by an individual and was not approved by a majority. This was because the CDSP Standing Committee advocated full participation in the government, wanting everyone to become officials, or preferring not to propose a list at all. After Zhang Junmai signed the "Policy Guidelines" with Chiang Kai-shek, Sun, Wang, and others rushed back to Shanghai overnight. On the day the Chiang government was established (the 18th), they issued a statement saying that Zhang's list was illegal and should be sanctioned according to the law, and that a national congress would be convened to deal with the matter. Tang Xiangming even openly demanded a "purge of the party." Chiang Kai-shek sent Lei Zhen to Shanghai to "mediate" but to no avail. Later, he telegraphed Xu Fulin to rush to Nanjing and Shanghai on the 19th to "help," and was willing to grant him an "official title" as a reward. While he haggled with Chiang Kai-shek, the "mediation" problem remained unresolved, and the help seemed to be creating more trouble. Furthermore, CDSP elders Liang Qiushui and Zhang Dongsun publicly wrote to Wu Xianzi and Hu Haimen on the eve of the government reorganization, questioning: "(A) Regarding the restoration of peace: (1) Will an immediate ceasefire proposal be put forward at the first National Government meeting after the reorganization? (2) If not, will you withdraw immediately? (3) If you do not withdraw or protest, will you share the responsibility for the civil war with the Kuomintang? (B) Regarding the trampling of the people's freedom: (1) Will you propose at the first National Government meeting after the reorganization that all illegally arrested persons be released, all illegally banned publications be restored, and all illegal arresting agencies be abolished, effective from January 1st? (2) If it is not passed, will you decide to withdraw? (3) If it is passed but not implemented, are you willing to share the responsibility for trampling human rights with the Kuomintang? Please answer clearly." A Shanghai newspaper commented that the letter was: "The wording is righteous and smooth, and the language is concise and exhaustive, and it is also what everyone wants to ask."

　　民社党内哄激烈
    孙宝刚张君劢等抢啃蒋政府骨头
    【新华社陕北十五日电】沪讯：民社党参加蒋政府后，抢啃骨头之内哄益趋激烈。民社党宣传部长徐傅霖十日向记者表示，只有改选主席和中常委会，重新组织民社党，否则解决纷争无希望。在参加“政府”之前，为“国府委员”名单事，该党之中常委孙宝刚王世铭等即纷纷提出反对张君劢，谓此名单为个人提出，未得多数同意，因该党中常会主张全面参加政府，要做官就大家做，否则宁可不提名单。及至张君劢与蒋介石签订“施政方针”后，孙王等即连夜赶回上海，于蒋政府成立之日（十八日）又发表声明，谓张之名单为不合法，应依法予以制裁，并谓将召开全国代表大会处理。汤芗铭更公开提出要求“清党”。蒋介石为此曾派雷震来沪“调停”无效，后又电召徐傅霖十九日夜赶来京沪“帮忙”，并愿赐他一个“官衔”作报酬。他一面与蒋介石讨价还价，再方面对“调停”问题仍无结果，大有愈帮愈忙之势。又：民社党元老梁秋水、张东荪于政府改组前夕曾公开致函伍宪子、胡海门，责问：“（甲）关于恢复和平：（１）是否于改组后第一次国府会议即提出立刻停战案？（２）如不这样是否即行退出？（３）如不退出或不抗议，是否与国民党共负内战之责？（乙）关于蹂躏人民自由权：（１）是否于改组后第一次国府会议上即提议主张自一月一日起将所有非法逮捕人士一律释放，非法封禁各种刊物一律恢复，非法捕人机关一律取消？（２）如不通过是否决定退出？（３）如通过而不实行，是否愿与国民党共负蹂躏人权之责任？请明白答复。”沪报评该信为：“辞正义顺，言简意尽，也是人人要问的。”
