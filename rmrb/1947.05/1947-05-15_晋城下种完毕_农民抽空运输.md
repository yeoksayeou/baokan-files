　　Jincheng Completes Sowing
    Peasants Spare Time for Transport
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 12th dispatch] The emancipated peasants of Jincheng, having completed sowing, are successively turning to transport and textile work. The Beilian clan mutual aid team in the Second District, starting from April 21st, organized all labor and animal power into thirteen transport teams to transport grain to the city. They earn 40 yuan per jin for freight, transporting 97 shi per day, earning 38,800 yuan. The Sixth District called on the vast number of women to learn spinning and weaving, so that every household can weave and everyone can spin. Each village, according to its different conditions, is engaged in production such as digging medicinal herbs, boiling sulfur, weaving straw hats, raising silkworms, and blacksmithing. District cadres personally helped the masses transport grain from Wangzhuang to Jiyuan, and have now transported more than 300,000 jin, earning over 4,400,000 yuan in freight. The three villages of Xijintou, Wangzhuang, and Dongtuhe earned 320,000 yuan in two days of transportation. According to the person in charge of the district: By carrying out sideline production during the agricultural slack before the summer harvest, the peasants in the entire district can complete all their burdens without selling a single grain, and can solve the problem of oil and salt for half a year.
    [This newspaper, Licheng dispatch] Before Grain Rain, the third team led by labor hero Zhang Deqing set a seven-day plan to launch a surprise sowing of hemp seeds, yam eggs, and cotton. The entire team had 49 laborers and 15 animals. After deducting two people who participated in the war effort, there were actually 47 laborers. In seven days, they overfulfilled the plan by planting 31 mu more. Transport captain Zhang Cangting also led the remaining 10 animals and 8 laborers in transportation, carrying coal to Wuxiang and buying cloth and salt in Yetao. After deducting capital and expenses, they earned 103,458 yuan. In the summary of these seven days, they gained experience. Everyone said that when agriculture and sideline industries are well combined, the plan can be realized, saving labor and making money. (Youcai, Shiheng)
