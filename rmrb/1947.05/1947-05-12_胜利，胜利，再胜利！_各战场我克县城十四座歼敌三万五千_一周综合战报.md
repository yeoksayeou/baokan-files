　　Victory, Victory, and More Victory!
　　Our Army Captures 14 County Towns and Eliminates 35,000 Enemies on All Fronts
　　Weekly Comprehensive War Report
　　In the past week (April 27th to May 4th), the People's Liberation Army has achieved great victories on all fronts. Even in Shaanxi and Shandong, which Chiang Kai-shek considered the main direction of his offensive, the Chiang army suffered major defeats.
　　On the Northwest battlefield, Hu Zongnan concentrated nine and a half brigades in an attempt to open the Yulin-Yan'an highway and join forces with Deng Baoshan, driving the People's Liberation Army across the east bank of the Yellow River. However, this "armed parade" had just reached Suide and had no time to rejoice before the People's Liberation Army cut off its rear, recovering Panlong Town, the location of Hu Zongnan's main supply depot, and eliminating the headquarters of Hu Zongnan's old First Division 167th Brigade and a regiment, a total of over 7,000 men; then, it pursued the reinforcing 84th Brigade to the outskirts of Yan'an. Hu Zongnan's good dream was difficult to achieve and he had to retreat in dejection. It is worth noting that in Guanzhong, another battlefield in Shaanxi, the People's Liberation Army advanced into the KMT-controlled areas, liberating Longfang Town and Jiaoping Town in succession, directly threatening Hu Zongnan's heart.
　　On the Shandong battlefield, despite several major defeats, the Chiang army concentrated thirteen reorganized divisions and invaded the Yimeng Mountains in five routes, intending to annihilate the main force of the East China People's Liberation Army and control the three strategic areas of central Shandong, southern Shandong, and the coastal area. This week's battles showed that this plan had completely failed. On the 28th and 29th, the Chiang army paid the price of 9,000 casualties to enter the two empty cities of Mengyin and Xintai. The People's Liberation Army took the initiative to counterattack Tai'an on the Jinpu Railway, digging out a piece of the Chiang army, and recovered eight county towns including Ningyang on the west side of the Jinpu Railway. Part of its main force advanced to its flanks and rear, forcing the more than 300,000 invading Chiang troops to shrink into a group, becoming increasingly passive.
　　On the Zhengtai battlefield, as of the 4th, the People's Liberation Army controlled more than 300 *li* of railway from Huolu to Mashou (belonging to Shouyang), recovered Yangquan and Shouyang, and eliminated 10,000 enemies. The two provinces of Shanxi and Hebei were connected, and the two major liberation armies of Jin-Chahar-Hebei and Jin-Hebei-Lu-Yu victoriously joined forces and advanced hand in hand, greatly encouraging the people of Shanxi under the bloody rule of Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan. Yan Xishan hurriedly scraped together 30,000 troops (twelve divisions) from the Tongpu Railway and concentrated them in Yuci City to "plug the gap," telling the people with a mourning face: "This time the Communists want to attack Taiyuan, and they have a lot of troops." (Yan Xishan broadcasted on the radio in Taiyuan on the 2nd night). According to a report by the French News Agency, he also sent a telegram to Chiang Kai-shek, who was struggling to cope, asking for help! Indeed, Chiang Kai-shek was exhausted; although the Central News Agency fabricated rumors every day that the Chiang army supporting Shijiazhuang from the south was making rapid progress, in fact, Shijiazhuang was still isolated. The three divisions and one brigade of Mou Tingfang, which came south from Baoding, never dared to advance, and after being driven out of Gaoyang in a surprise attack by our army, retreated to Baoding again.
　　The Jin-Hebei-Lu-Yu People's Liberation Army galloped across the land, completely controlling the initiative. The Jinan triangle area, except for the four isolated strongholds of Anyi, Yuncheng, Xiaxian, and Yuanqu, has become a clear land. General Chen Geng's iron pincers can cut off the Longhai Railway, the blood vessel of Chiang and Hu, at any time. In northern Henan, the People's Liberation Army captured Tangyin City on the 2nd, capturing Sun Dianying, who the people of northern Henan called a poisonous insect. The People's Liberation Army took advantage of the victory to recover Fengqiu, Yangwu, and Yanjin, and surrounded Anyang. The Chiang army was compressed into the narrow areas of Xinxiang and Jixian, and they were trembling in the face of the disaster of being annihilated.
　　Our army in Jehol-Liaoning recovered Lingyuan and cut off the Jin-Cheng Railway.
　　This week, the People's Liberation Army on all fronts recovered fourteen county towns including Dongping, Ningyang, Wenshang, Feicheng, Tangyin, Fengqiu, Yangwu, Yanjin, Yicheng, Pinglu, Dingxiang, Shouyang, Pinging, and Lingyuan, and eliminated more than 35,000 enemies. The victory has inspired the whole country. Jin Diancheng, Chief of Staff of Chiang's Beiping Command Post, revealed at a press conference: A large slogan "Can you defeat the Communist Party by yourselves?" was found on the three gates of Beiping. The Chiang-occupied cities are in a state of panic. In Langfang and other places, even people wearing glasses are "strictly forbidden from entering or leaving."

### 胜利，胜利，再胜利！  各战场我克县城十四座歼敌三万五千  一周综合战报

　　胜利，胜利，再胜利！
    各战场我克县城十四座歼敌三万五千
    一周综合战报
    过去一周（四月廿七日至五月四日）战局的发展，人民解放军在各个战场上都取得很大胜利，即使在蒋介石作为主要进攻方向的陕北和山东，也使蒋军吃了很大的败仗。
    西北战场胡宗南集中九个半旅妄图打通榆延公路同邓宝珊会师，并把解放军赶过黄河东岸。可是“武装大游行”刚游到绥德，来不及高兴，就被人民解放军抄了后路，收复胡宗南总补给站口的蟠龙镇，消灭了胡宗南的老本第一师一六七旅旅部及一个团、一个总队共七千余人；接着又把增援的八十四旅追击到延安城边。胡宗南好梦难成，只得垂头丧气回窜。值得注意的是陕北另一个战场的关中，人民解放军向蒋管区挺进，连续解放龙坊镇、焦坪镇，直接威胁着胡宗南的心脏。
    山东战场蒋军不顾几次重大惨败，集中十三个整编师，五路进犯沂蒙山区，打算歼灭华东人民解放军主力，控制鲁中鲁南滨海三个战略地区，本周战事显示这个计划是完全破产了。二十八、二十九两日蒋军付出了九千名牺牲代价进入蒙阴、新泰两座空城，人民解放军主动反击在津浦线上的泰安，把蒋军挖掉一块，并在津浦西侧收复宁阳等八座县城，一部主力向其侧后挺进，迫使三十余万进犯蒋军紧缩一团，日趋被动。
    正太战场至四日止人民解放军控制了自获鹿至马首（寿阳属）三百余华里的铁路，收复阳泉、寿阳，歼敌万人、晋冀两省连成一片，晋察冀同晋冀鲁豫两大解放军胜利会师、携手并进，大大鼓舞了蒋阎血猩统治下的山西人民。阎锡山急急忙忙从同蒲线上拚凑三万人马（十二个师）集中在榆次城“堵口”，摆着哭丧的脸告诉老百姓说：“这次共军要攻太原，他们兵力很大。”（二日夜阎锡山在太原广播）据法国新闻处报导，他还给那个自顾不暇的蒋介石打了一通求援告急的电报哩！的确，蒋介石是穷于应付了；虽然中央社天天造谣说南援石门的蒋军如何进展的快，但事实上石门依然是被孤立着，从保定南下的牟庭芳三个师一个旅始终不敢前进，于偷袭高阳被我逐出后又退至保定。
    晋冀鲁豫人民解放军纵横驰骋，完全掌握主动。晋南三角地带除了安邑、运城、夏县、垣曲四个孤立据点外，已成一片光明净土；陈赓将军铁钳随时可以切断蒋胡输血管的陇海路。豫北方面人民解放军二日拔掉汤阴城，活捉了豫北人民称之为毒虫的孙殿英。人民解放军乘胜收复封邱、阳武、延津，包围安阳。蒋军被压缩在新乡、汲县狭小地区，他们正在聚歼的厄运面前发抖。
    冀热辽我军收复凌源，切断锦承路。
    本周各战场人民解放军共收复东平、宁阳、汶上、肥城、汤阴、封邱、阳武、延津、茵城、平陆、定襄、寿阳、平定、凌源等十四座县城，歼敌三万五千余人，胜利振奋全国。蒋记北平指挥所参谋长金典成在招待记者会上泄露：北平三座门上发现了“单凭你们能打共产党吗？”的大标语。蒋占各城市风声鹤唳，廊坊等地连戴眼镜的人都“严禁进出”了。（新华社陕北十日电）
