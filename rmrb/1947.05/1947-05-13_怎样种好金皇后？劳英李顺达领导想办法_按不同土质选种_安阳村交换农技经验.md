　　How to Grow Good Golden Queen Corn?
    Labor Hero Li Shunda Leads the Way to Find Solutions
    Select Seeds According to Different Soil Types
    Anyang Village Exchanges Agricultural Techniques
    [Report from this newspaper in Pingshun] Labor hero Li Shunda convened a symposium of the Xigou Technical Committee on the 3rd of this month to promote the Golden Queen corn. Because some Golden Queen corn suffered from frost last year and some did not ear, some people are unwilling to plant it again. At the symposium, old farmer Niu Yongqing said: "The reason for not earing last year was dense planting, too much mixed grain, and careless seed selection, and the planting was also late. If we plant one season earlier than last year, it will not be frosted again this year." Finally, everyone decided that the technical committee should select 30 mu of black soil with good ventilation, sunshine and deep soil to plant Golden Queen corn. The seeds should be the selected Golden Queen, removing the small seeds at both ends. The planting method should use point sowing, with a density of less than 1,000 plants per mu, and all seeds will be pure this year; manure should be used when planting. Then everyone discussed the issue of applying manure: sheep manure and donkey manure for shady land, and cattle manure for sunny land. Seeds have been adjusted among households. Recently, there was a drizzle, and everyone discussed planting sunny land first. (Ju Lin, Wang Kao, Kuan Shun, Wen Ke, Bi Xian)
    [Another report] Cui Fubao, a labor hero in the Seventh District of Anyang, took advantage of the rainy weather on May 1st to convene a symposium of the technical committee to exchange experience. Cui Fubao first said: "Black sandy soil and red sandy soil are best for growing corn and millet, but for sunny land, you should choose clumsy seeds, and for shady land, you should choose coarse seeds (early-maturing crops), and for semi-sunny land, you should choose semi-coarse seeds (neither coarse nor clumsy)." Li Erbao said: "There are also two types of soil: black shale and red shale. Red shale soil is best for growing dangshen (Codonopsis pilosula); one year, planting one mu of dangshen in Qingjia Gedao yielded fifty or sixty jin more of dried dangshen than in previous years. Someone else said: "White soil is divided into two types: sandy soil and dry (magnetic) soil. It is suitable for growing beans and wheat. Wang Fuzeng planted one mu of groundnut vines and applied a lot of fertilizer, but only harvested one load of groundnuts the size of apricot kernels, which was really not worth it." Then everyone discussed that five of the thirteen mutual aid groups in the village soaked seeds, and 150 mu of millet that had already been sown were soaked. Miao Youxin said: "After I soaked the seeds last year, the crops that grew had very little reed heart black mold. As the saying goes: 'Soaking five grains in water makes them drought-resistant and insect-resistant'." Everyone is determined to promote the soaking of all 600 mu of corn in the village. Cui Baocheng, an experienced old farmer, introduced a method for killing insects. He said: "If insects are born in the field, you can stir-fry mustard greens until yellow (but not burnt), and plant three liters per mu, mixing them with the millet. It kills insects and provides fertilizer. There is always a patch of oily soil the size of a coin around each mustard seed, and the crops that grow are particularly good." After the meeting, Cui Fubao personally ran to Sitou to exchange for more than two dou of clumsy corn seeds, and advocated that millet land should be rotated with corn, and corn should be rotated with millet. He said: "Continuous millet crops are not as good as none." Even if replanting millet, it is best to change seeds. (Chun Xi, Han Jie, Wei Yang)

　　怎样种好金皇后？
    劳英李顺达领导想办法         
    按不同土质选种
    安阳村交换农技经验
    【本报平顺讯】劳动英雄李顺达于本月三日召开西沟技术委员会座谈。推广金皇后问题，因为去年有些金皇后霜了，有些没＠穗，因此有些不愿意再种。座谈会上老农牛永清说：“去年没＠穗是种的稠、带杂多、选种不仔细，而且种的也迟了，今年比去年早种一个节令，就不会再霜了。”最后大家决定要由技术委员会选择通风向阳土深的黑土地三十亩种金皇后，种籽要把选出的金皇后除掉两尖的小籽。播种方法要使用点种，每亩稀稠一千棵以下，今年全部不带杂格；栽时要用圊粪。接着大家又讨论了上粪问题：背阴地上羊粪、驴粪，向阳地上牛粪。种籽各户都已调剂，最近下了指把小雨，大家讨论先种向阳地。（巨林、王考、宽顺、文科、必贤）
    【又讯】七区安阳劳英崔富保趁五月一日天雨，召集技术委员会座谈，交流经验。崔富保先说：“黑砂土、红砂土两色土长玉茭、谷最好，可是向阳地要选笨种，背阴地选糙种（早熟庄稼），二阳地选二糙种（不糙不笨）。”李二保说：“还有一种是黑夹板红夹板两种土质，红夹板土最好长党质；有一年在青家圪倒种一亩党参比往常年多收五、六十斤干党参。又有人说：“白土质分砂土、干（土性发磁）土两种，宜种豆、小麦，王福增种了一亩地蔓，上肥大，可是只收了杏核大的地蔓一担，真不算话。”接着大家又讨论到村上十三个互助组浸种的有五个组，在已下种的谷中，浸种的有一百五十亩。苗有信说：“我去年浸种后，长的庄稼芦心乌霉很少。俗话说：‘水浸五谷种，耐旱不生虫’。”大家都决心推动全村六百多亩玉茭全部浸种。有经验老农崔保成介绍杀虫办法，他说：“地里生虫可把芥菜炒黄（不要焦了），每亩种三升，和谷混在一起种，既杀虫，又顶粪。每个芥籽周围总有制钱大的一块油碌碌的土，长起庄稼特别好。”会后崔富保亲自跑到寺头换来笨子玉茭二斗多，并提倡谷地要调种玉茭，玉茭要调种谷，他说：“谷茬谷，不如不”。即使种重茬谷，最好要调换种籽。（春喜、汉杰、维扬）
