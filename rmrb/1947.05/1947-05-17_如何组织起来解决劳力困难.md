    How to Organize to Solve Labor Difficulties

            The Degree of Labor Shortage Seen from Calculations

    To correctly understand and solve the difficulty of labor shortage, accurate calculation is necessary. Based on the actual labor force in various places and the different situations in each place, specifically calculate how much land a labor force can cultivate, how much labor efficiency can be improved by organizing, and whether labor difficulties can be solved. From the calculations in the old and new areas of the Taihang Region, it is seen that labor is generally felt to be lacking. If only male full laborers participate in production, then most of the land cannot be cultivated. In Dongbao Village, Wuxiang, in the old area, the uncultivated land accounts for 36 percent of the village's total land, in Longwang Village, Heshun, it accounts for 38 percent, and in Beiliu Village, Licheng, it accounts for 30 percent. However, under the condition that all labor is organized, these difficulties can be solved. According to the calculation of Longwang Village, Heshun, the land is 774.27 mu, each mu of land requires 9.6 workdays, totaling 7432.99 workdays. There are 34 full laborers in the village, and the actual number of agricultural producers is 27, while the other 7 are cooperative personnel who have left agricultural production. If calculated with 34 people, the agricultural production season is eight months, then there are a total of 8160 workdays, with a surplus of 727 workdays, equivalent to 3 full laborers. But if calculated with 27 people, there are only 6480 workdays, with a shortage of 52.99 workdays, equivalent to 4 weak full laborers. Calculated in this way, 12.8 percent of the land cannot be cultivated. In addition, each male full laborer must bear 70.75 days of corv√©e and miscellaneous work in eight months, which reduces 7.96 full laborers, totaling 12 weak full laborers. A total of 298.19 mu of land cannot be cultivated, accounting for 28.5 percent of the total cultivated land. However, if one-third of all the village's semi-laborers, auxiliary laborers, and women are organized, it can be converted into 17 male full laborers. Increasing labor intensity through mutual aid can add 3 full laborers, totaling 20, which will solve the labor difficulties and also free up labor to develop sideline and handicraft production.
    Beiliu Village, Licheng, has a total of 3266.885 mu of land, 150 male full laborers, 85 semi-laborers, and 54 auxiliary laborers, equivalent to 206 full laborers. In the 240-day agricultural and sideline production season of the year, each laborer needs 120 days for errands and odd jobs, so only 120 days are actually left for agricultural activities. Each male full laborer cultivates an average of 21.78 mu of land, and each mu of land requires 7.5 workdays. The village requires a total of 24501.6 workdays. According to 150 male full laborers, there are a total of 236000 workdays, with a surplus of 11498 workdays. If semi-laborers and auxiliary laborers all participate in production, there can be a surplus of 24938.4 workdays, equivalent to 1039 people. However, if the 120 days of missed work due to errands and odd jobs are deducted, the 150 male full laborers will miss a total of 18000 workdays, equivalent to 15 people. In this way, not only is there no surplus, but 995 mu of land cannot be cultivated (accounting for 30.5 percent of the total cultivated land). But if all labor is calculated, excluding the missed work, there is a surplus of 28.7 workdays. At the same time, under the conditions of organizing and increasing labor intensity, efficiency can be increased by one-third, and each full laborer can also complete land cultivation in 120 days. In this way, the labor shortage can be filled and there will be a surplus.
    In the new area, taking Xiguxian Village, Changzhi, as an example, the village has a total of 3029 mu of land, 113 male full laborers, 65 male semi-laborers, equivalent to 32.5 male full laborers, 84 female full laborers, one-third equivalent to 28 male full laborers, 83 female semi-laborers, one-sixth equivalent to 13.8 male full laborers, totaling 187.3 male full laborers. Each laborer in the village can cultivate 12 mu of land. The 113 full laborers can cultivate 1356 mu of land, and 1673 mu cannot be cultivated, totaling a shortage of 139.5 full laborers, meaning that 55 percent of the land cannot be cultivated. If all male and female semi-laborers are organized, they can total 74, still short of 65, meaning that 780 mu of land cannot be cultivated, accounting for 25.75 percent of the total cultivated land. But if organized, the intensity can be increased by one-third, which can barely solve the problem, but the development of sideline production will be quite difficult.

            New Creation of Labor Organization in Renzhuang, Licheng

    From the calculation of labor shortage, we can see that women must be organized through production mobilization. Because the calculation shows that 43 percent of the women are able to work, and there is actually this strength. According to the situation calculation, this year, combining participation in war production with organization to overcome labor difficulties has been proposed. In solving this problem, various places have broken the old organizational scope in the past and created many new forms, such as the Shizhenming Mutual Aid Brigade in the Taiyue Region, the labor cooperative in Renzhuang, Licheng, and various contract systems. Now let's study and introduce the organizational form of the labor cooperative in Renzhuang, Licheng.
    The labor cooperative in Renzhuang, Licheng, is a village-wide labor partnership, evaluating work based on land, recording work based on tasks, contributing work as shares, and using it uniformly. All the village's labor is organized, uniformly controlled and led by the production committee, uniformly printing work tickets, unifying wages, and settling accounts and distributing dividends in spring, summer, autumn, and winter seasons by brigade. Each person joins the team, and the brigade provides work to offset the share, receiving work tickets. Each household's land is democratically evaluated for work, and the required number of workdays for the whole year is determined based on the degree of labor required for the crops and the distance of the land, divided into three grades of evaluation: near, far and mixed. For example, the Shen Yuqin brigade, the labor hero of the village, has a total of 632.6 mu of land, including 223.2 mu of wheat land and 419.4 mu of autumn land, with a total evaluation of 10222.5 workdays for the whole year.
    After the establishment of this labor cooperative, due to the implementation of recording work based on tasks, contributing work as shares, and uniformly distributing dividends, the more work contributed, the more dividends received. Therefore, laborers contribute as much as possible, and old men and children can also do the work of young adults. For example, short errands such as transporting fertilizer are done with the same effort as full laborers, earning the same work points. Therefore, semi-laborers and auxiliary laborers are more active, thus absorbing all labor to be fully organized and greatly promoting and improving labor intensity and labor efficiency.
    Due to labor cooperation, the contradiction between war service and production has been more appropriately resolved. First, the scope of errands has been expanded and the concern about delaying work at home due to going out on errands has been eliminated. There are 51 laborers in the village who do not go on errands. Excluding 17 people who work in the saltpeter workshop all year round and 8 district traffic officers who do not do errand duties, only 26 people actually go on errands. With an average of 8 people going on errands per day in the village, they have to take turns every three days, and the time for work is even less with participation in the war. After labor cooperation, participating in the war and going on errands are counted as one workday per person, and a daily travel allowance of 500 yuan is awarded. Donkey errands (one person one donkey) are 200 yuan per day for short errands (not staying overnight) and 1000 yuan for long errands. All male auxiliary laborers who do not do errand duties participate in errands and are similarly counted as work points for dividend distribution. In this way, 43 percent of the village's auxiliary labor has been absorbed to participate in errand work that they are capable of, saving the labor of using full laborers for errands for sideline production.
    Labor cooperation has also made it possible to free up surplus agricultural labor to specialize in sideline occupations, doing whatever they are good at, so that agricultural and sideline occupations are combined throughout the year. After accurate calculation of the village's labor force, scientific division of labor is carried out. Under the principle of not hindering agriculture, ten sets of large carts are drawn out for year-round transportation, recording one workday for every 100 jin of cargo, and specifying human and animal travel expenses according to the price of goods and actual needs in each period. Special personnel are responsible for sideline production such as boiling saltpeter and grinding flour, so that everyone can use their talents and be used uniformly. In addition to all expenses, all income is counted as the income of the entire brigade. The total surplus is distributed uniformly according to the total number of workdays in the entire brigade, except for one percent to be used as a bonus (awarded to activists in war participation and production). Therefore, everyone says in unison, "This time we can organize well, and everyone will benefit."
    The production difficulties of military dependents and cadre dependents have also been properly resolved. The military dependents' land that should be cultivated is uniformly distributed to the groups according to the labor force that each team should cultivate, and the groups collectively cultivate the land, obtaining group work tickets for work points and dividend distribution. Because agriculture, sideline occupations, war participation, and errands are everyone's business, cultivation is no exception and is everyone's business. Cultivation is no longer simply a task, but can earn points and cultivate land in the same way. Military dependents also have a reliable source of income for cultivating land. This method in Renzhuang is a new creation in current organization.
    In order to solve the labor difficulties, we should boldly and freely organize at present. Each region has its own specific different situations. According to the willingness of the masses, any method should be developed creatively as much as possible, especially in the new areas, and the experience of the old areas should not be simply copied, so as not to bind the wisdom of the masses. In addition, in order to solve the labor imbalance between villages, we should also promote large-scale labor exchange and adjustment between villages to solve labor difficulties.
