    How to Organize to Solve Labor Difficulties

            The Degree of Labor Shortage Seen from Calculations

    To correctly understand and solve the difficulty of labor shortage, accurate calculation is necessary. Based on the actual labor force in various places and the different situations in each place, specifically calculate how much land a labor force can cultivate, how much labor efficiency can be improved by organizing, and whether labor difficulties can be solved. From the calculations in the old and new areas of the Taihang Region, it is seen that labor is generally felt to be lacking. If only male full laborers participate in production, then most of the land cannot be cultivated. In Dongbao Village, Wuxiang, in the old area, the uncultivated land accounts for 36 percent of the village's total land, in Longwang Village, Heshun, it accounts for 38 percent, and in Beiliu Village, Licheng, it accounts for 30 percent. However, under the condition that all labor is organized, these difficulties can be solved. According to the calculation of Longwang Village, Heshun, the land is 774.27 mu, each mu of land requires 9.6 workdays, totaling 7432.99 workdays. There are 34 full laborers in the village, and the actual number of agricultural producers is 27, while the other 7 are cooperative personnel who have left agricultural production. If calculated with 34 people, the agricultural production season is eight months, then there are a total of 8160 workdays, with a surplus of 727 workdays, equivalent to 3 full laborers. But if calculated with 27 people, there are only 6480 workdays, with a shortage of 52.99 workdays, equivalent to 4 weak full laborers. Calculated in this way, 12.8 percent of the land cannot be cultivated. In addition, each male full laborer must bear 70.75 days of corvée and miscellaneous work in eight months, which reduces 7.96 full laborers, totaling 12 weak full laborers. A total of 298.19 mu of land cannot be cultivated, accounting for 28.5 percent of the total cultivated land. However, if one-third of all the village's semi-laborers, auxiliary laborers, and women are organized, it can be converted into 17 male full laborers. Increasing labor intensity through mutual aid can add 3 full laborers, totaling 20, which will solve the labor difficulties and also free up labor to develop sideline and handicraft production.
    Beiliu Village, Licheng, has a total of 3266.885 mu of land, 150 male full laborers, 85 semi-laborers, and 54 auxiliary laborers, equivalent to 206 full laborers. In the 240-day agricultural and sideline production season of the year, each laborer needs 120 days for errands and odd jobs, so only 120 days are actually left for agricultural activities. Each male full laborer cultivates an average of 21.78 mu of land, and each mu of land requires 7.5 workdays. The village requires a total of 24501.6 workdays. According to 150 male full laborers, there are a total of 236000 workdays, with a surplus of 11498 workdays. If semi-laborers and auxiliary laborers all participate in production, there can be a surplus of 24938.4 workdays, equivalent to 1039 people. However, if the 120 days of missed work due to errands and odd jobs are deducted, the 150 male full laborers will miss a total of 18000 workdays, equivalent to 15 people. In this way, not only is there no surplus, but 995 mu of land cannot be cultivated (accounting for 30.5 percent of the total cultivated land). But if all labor is calculated, excluding the missed work, there is a surplus of 28.7 workdays. At the same time, under the conditions of organizing and increasing labor intensity, efficiency can be increased by one-third, and each full laborer can also complete land cultivation in 120 days. In this way, the labor shortage can be filled and there will be a surplus.
    In the new area, taking Xiguxian Village, Changzhi, as an example, the village has a total of 3029 mu of land, 113 male full laborers, 65 male semi-laborers, equivalent to 32.5 male full laborers, 84 female full laborers, one-third equivalent to 28 male full laborers, 83 female semi-laborers, one-sixth equivalent to 13.8 male full laborers, totaling 187.3 male full laborers. Each laborer in the village can cultivate 12 mu of land. The 113 full laborers can cultivate 1356 mu of land, and 1673 mu cannot be cultivated, totaling a shortage of 139.5 full laborers, meaning that 55 percent of the land cannot be cultivated. If all male and female semi-laborers are organized, they can total 74, still short of 65, meaning that 780 mu of land cannot be cultivated, accounting for 25.75 percent of the total cultivated land. But if organized, the intensity can be increased by one-third, which can barely solve the problem, but the development of sideline production will be quite difficult.

            New Creation of Labor Organization in Renzhuang, Licheng

    From the calculation of labor shortage, we can see that women must be organized through production mobilization. Because the calculation shows that 43 percent of the women are able to work, and there is actually this strength. According to the situation calculation, this year, combining participation in war production with organization to overcome labor difficulties has been proposed. In solving this problem, various places have broken the old organizational scope in the past and created many new forms, such as the Shizhenming Mutual Aid Brigade in the Taiyue Region, the labor cooperative in Renzhuang, Licheng, and various contract systems. Now let's study and introduce the organizational form of the labor cooperative in Renzhuang, Licheng.
    The labor cooperative in Renzhuang, Licheng, is a village-wide labor partnership, evaluating work based on land, recording work based on tasks, contributing work as shares, and using it uniformly. All the village's labor is organized, uniformly controlled and led by the production committee, uniformly printing work tickets, unifying wages, and settling accounts and distributing dividends in spring, summer, autumn, and winter seasons by brigade. Each person joins the team, and the brigade provides work to offset the share, receiving work tickets. Each household's land is democratically evaluated for work, and the required number of workdays for the whole year is determined based on the degree of labor required for the crops and the distance of the land, divided into three grades of evaluation: near, far and mixed. For example, the Shen Yuqin brigade, the labor hero of the village, has a total of 632.6 mu of land, including 223.2 mu of wheat land and 419.4 mu of autumn land, with a total evaluation of 10222.5 workdays for the whole year.
    After the establishment of this labor cooperative, due to the implementation of recording work based on tasks, contributing work as shares, and uniformly distributing dividends, the more work contributed, the more dividends received. Therefore, laborers contribute as much as possible, and old men and children can also do the work of young adults. For example, short errands such as transporting fertilizer are done with the same effort as full laborers, earning the same work points. Therefore, semi-laborers and auxiliary laborers are more active, thus absorbing all labor to be fully organized and greatly promoting and improving labor intensity and labor efficiency.
    Due to labor cooperation, the contradiction between war service and production has been more appropriately resolved. First, the scope of errands has been expanded and the concern about delaying work at home due to going out on errands has been eliminated. There are 51 laborers in the village who do not go on errands. Excluding 17 people who work in the saltpeter workshop all year round and 8 district traffic officers who do not do errand duties, only 26 people actually go on errands. With an average of 8 people going on errands per day in the village, they have to take turns every three days, and the time for work is even less with participation in the war. After labor cooperation, participating in the war and going on errands are counted as one workday per person, and a daily travel allowance of 500 yuan is awarded. Donkey errands (one person one donkey) are 200 yuan per day for short errands (not staying overnight) and 1000 yuan for long errands. All male auxiliary laborers who do not do errand duties participate in errands and are similarly counted as work points for dividend distribution. In this way, 43 percent of the village's auxiliary labor has been absorbed to participate in errand work that they are capable of, saving the labor of using full laborers for errands for sideline production.
    Labor cooperation has also made it possible to free up surplus agricultural labor to specialize in sideline occupations, doing whatever they are good at, so that agricultural and sideline occupations are combined throughout the year. After accurate calculation of the village's labor force, scientific division of labor is carried out. Under the principle of not hindering agriculture, ten sets of large carts are drawn out for year-round transportation, recording one workday for every 100 jin of cargo, and specifying human and animal travel expenses according to the price of goods and actual needs in each period. Special personnel are responsible for sideline production such as boiling saltpeter and grinding flour, so that everyone can use their talents and be used uniformly. In addition to all expenses, all income is counted as the income of the entire brigade. The total surplus is distributed uniformly according to the total number of workdays in the entire brigade, except for one percent to be used as a bonus (awarded to activists in war participation and production). Therefore, everyone says in unison, "This time we can organize well, and everyone will benefit."
    The production difficulties of military dependents and cadre dependents have also been properly resolved. The military dependents' land that should be cultivated is uniformly distributed to the groups according to the labor force that each team should cultivate, and the groups collectively cultivate the land, obtaining group work tickets for work points and dividend distribution. Because agriculture, sideline occupations, war participation, and errands are everyone's business, cultivation is no exception and is everyone's business. Cultivation is no longer simply a task, but can earn points and cultivate land in the same way. Military dependents also have a reliable source of income for cultivating land. This method in Renzhuang is a new creation in current organization.
    In order to solve the labor difficulties, we should boldly and freely organize at present. Each region has its own specific different situations. According to the willingness of the masses, any method should be developed creatively as much as possible, especially in the new areas, and the experience of the old areas should not be simply copied, so as not to bind the wisdom of the masses. In addition, in order to solve the labor imbalance between villages, we should also promote large-scale labor exchange and adjustment between villages to solve labor difficulties.

　　如何组织起来解决劳力困难
    边府办公室  广居  东平
            从计算中看劳力缺乏程度
    要正确认识与解决劳力缺乏的困难，必须精确计算，根据各地实有劳力及各地不同情况，具体的计算一个劳动力能种多少地，组织起来能提高多少劳动效能，究竟能不能解决劳力困难。从太行区新老区计算中看到劳力都感缺乏，如果只有男全劳力参加生产，则土地大部种不过来。老区武乡东堡村种不过来的地占全村土地总数百分之卅六，和顺龙旺村占百分之三十八，黎城北流村占百分之三十。但是在全部劳力组织起来的条件下，则这些困难都可能解决。和顺龙旺村的计算，土地七七四·二七亩，每亩地需用工九·六个，共需工七四三二·九九工，该村全劳力三四人，参加农业生产者实有二七人，另七人则为脱离农业生产的合作人员。如以三四人计，农业生产季节为八个月，则共有八一六○工，尚剩余七二七工，折合全劳力三人。但如以二十七人计，就只有六四八○工，还缺少五二·九九工，合全劳力四个弱。这样计算下来，要有百分之一二·八亩地种不上。再加上八个月中每男全劳力须有七○·七五天力役负担及杂事役工，则又减少全劳力七·九六个，两项共减少全劳力一二个弱，共有二九八·一九亩地种不上。占耕地总数百分之二十八·五。但如果将全村半劳力辅助劳力妇女组织起来三分之一，即可折合男全劳力一七人。从互助提高劳动强度，可增加三个全劳力，共为二十个，这就解决了劳力困难，并能再抽出劳力，发展副业手工业生产。
    黎城北流村共地三二六六·八八五亩，男全劳力一五○个，半劳力八五个，辅助劳力五四个，共折合全劳力二○六个，在全年二四○天的农副业生产季节中，每一劳力支差作零活需一二○天，因此在农事活动上实际只留下一二○天。每一男全劳力平均种地二一·七八亩，每亩地须七·五工，全村共须工二四五○一·六个。按一五○个男全劳力计，共有工二三六○○○个工，尚余一一四九八个工，如将半劳力、辅助劳力均参加生产，则可剩余二四九三八·四个工，合一○三九人。但如除去支差零活等误工一二○天计，则一五○个男全劳力共误工一八○○○个，合十五人。这样不但不能长余，反而要有九九五亩地种不上（占耕地总数百分之三○·五）。但如将全部劳力计算在内，除误工的补起外，尚余二八·七个工。同时在组织起来提高劳动强度条件下，能提高三分之一的效率，每一全劳力亦能在一二○天内能完成土地耕作，这样便可补足劳力缺乏而且有余了。
    新区以长治西故县村计算，全村共土地三○二九亩，男全劳力一一三个，男半劳力六五个，折男全劳力三二五个，女全劳力八四个，三折一合男全劳力二八个，女半劳力八三个，六折一合男全劳力一三八个，男女共折合男全劳力一八七三个。本村每一劳力能种地十二亩。一一三个全劳力能种地一三五六亩，尚有一六七三亩种不了，合计缺乏全劳力一三九·五个，即等到有百分之五十五土地种不上。如把男女半劳力都组织起来，共计可顶七四个，尚缺六五个，即还有七八○亩地种不上，占耕地总数百分之二十五·七五。但组织起来，能提高强度三分之一，则还可以勉强解决问题，但副业生产的进行则有其相当困难。
            黎城仁庄组织劳力的新创造
    从劳力缺乏计算中，我们看出必须经过生产动员把妇女组织起来。因计算中有百分之四十三的活妇女可以担任，实际还有这力量。根据情况计算，今年参战生产结合组织起来，以克服劳力困难就被提了出来，各地在解决这一问题上却打破了过去旧的组织范围，创造了许多新形式。如太岳区石振明互助大队，黎城仁庄的劳力合作社，以及其它各种包工制等等。现就黎城仁庄组织形式作一研究介绍。
    黎城仁庄的劳力合作社是全村规模的劳力合伙，按地评工，按活记工，以工入股，统一使用。将全村劳力全部组织起来，由生产委员会统一掌握领导，统一印工票，统一工资，以大队为单位按春、夏、秋、冬四季结账分红，每人入队大队出工顶工股，领取工票，各家土地民主评工，根据庄稼的费工程度，地的远近零整分三等评工，每等确定标准地，评定全年需工数。如该村劳动英雄申玉芹大队共地六三二·六亩，内麦地二二三·二亩，秋地四一九·四亩，全年评工一○二二二·五工。
    这一劳力合作社成立后，由于按活计工，以工入股，统一分红的执行，入工越多即分红越多，所以劳力尽量入股，老汉小孩也可作了青壮年的事。如支短差运肥等，做了同全劳力一样的工，同样顶足工分。因此半劳力辅助劳力更加积极，这样吸收了全部劳力全面组织起来，并大大发扬与提高劳动强度劳动效率。
    由于劳力合作，更恰当的解决了战勤与生产的矛盾，首先扩大了支差面与解除了出外支差耽误家里活的顾虑，该村不支差的劳力共五十一人，除去长年硝房十七人与区交通员八人不作差务外，实支差人仅二十六人，以全村平均每日支差八人计，三天内即要轮一次，再加参战，作活的时间就更少了。劳力合作后，参战与支差每人一天计一工，并奖励每天路费五百元，支差驴（一人一驴），短差（不住夜）每天二百元，长差一千元，凡不作差务的男辅助劳力参加支差，同样计工入股分红。这样就吸收了全村百分之四十三的辅助劳力，参加了能胜任的差务工作，节省了不必要用全劳力支差的工用到副业生产上去。
    劳动合作又做到了腾出农业剩余劳力专门从事副业，会干啥就干啥生产，使农副业结合贯彻全年。根据全村劳力精确计算后科学分工，在不妨碍农业原则下，抽出十套大车长年运输，载重一百斤记一工，并根据每个时期的物价及实际需用，规定人畜路费。熬硝磨面等等副业生产，由专人负责，做到人尽其材统一使用。除一切花费外，所有收入均作全大队收入。总盈余除抽百分之一作奖励金外（奖给参战与生产的积极分子），余均按全大队总入工数统一分红，因此大家一致说，这一下可组织好啦，大家沾光。
    军属、干属生产困难亦得到妥善解决，全村该代耕的军属土地按每队应代耕劳力统一分配给小组，由小组集体代耕，得小组工票，计工分红，因为农副业、参战、支差都是大家的事，代耕当然无例外，也是大家的事，代耕不再单纯成为任务，而是可以得分，能够一样种地，军属种地也有了靠墙。仁庄这一办法，是目前组织起来的新创造。
    为了解决劳力困难，目前应是大胆放手的组织起来，各地区都有其具体不同之情况，根据群众的自愿，任何方式都应尽量发挥创造性，特别在新区，尤不应单纯搬用老区的经验，以致束缚了群众智慧的发挥。此外，为了解决村与村之劳力不平衡，还应该发扬村与村劳力大变工与大调剂，以解决劳力困难。
