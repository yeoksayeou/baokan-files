　　[This dispatch from our JiluYu correspondent, dated the 24th] Hubuzhai Village in Puyang County combined war support with land investigation to carry out mutual assistance in spring plowing. The entire village had more than four *qing* of spring land, which was sown in only three days. The division of labor was as follows: the village head took a stretcher to the front lines, and the instructor and the head of the farmers' association organized production and re-investigation at home, organizing all the people in the village. Those aged fifty-five to sixty formed the "old men's group," those under eighteen formed the "children's group," and the women's group was also divided into elderly and young groups. Young and middle-aged people aged eighteen to thirty-five were organized into four brigades, each brigade having three to five people responsible for pulling plows and tilling the land. All thirty-seven livestock in the village were divided into groups of three, and large-scale mutual assistance was implemented throughout the village, based on the streets as units. The old men's group stood guard and kept watch, and young women helped with plowing. In the evenings, clearing accounts, struggle sessions, and distribution of the fruits of labor were carried out.
