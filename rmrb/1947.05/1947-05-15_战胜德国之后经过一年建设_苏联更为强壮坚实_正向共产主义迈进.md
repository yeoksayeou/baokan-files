Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th: Moscow dispatch: The entire Soviet Union enthusiastically celebrated Victory in Europe Day on May 9th. *Pravda* published an editorial, stating: Today, with gratitude and mourning, we lower our flags to pay tribute to the heroic men and women who sacrificed themselves in the war against the enemy! They dedicated their lives to the free and happy lives of our country and all of humanity. As a result of German aggression, German occupation, and the deportation of Soviet people to Germany for forced labor, the Soviet Union has irretrievably lost seven million lives in the war. As is well known, the direct property damage suffered by the Soviet Union amounted to 679 billion rubles. Some politicians and idlers in the United States, Britain, and other countries are very eager to forget these enormous sacrifices. The heroic struggle and significant sacrifices of the Soviet people ensured the complete victory over Hitler's Germany. The solid foundation for post-war international cooperation was also established in this way. When Marshal Stalin met with Mr. Stassen, a leading Republican from the United States, he spoke of the possibility and desire for cooperation between two different economic systems. Marshal Stalin said: People should distinguish between the possibility of cooperation and the desire for cooperation. The possibility of cooperation is always there, but the desire for cooperation is not always there. As for the Soviet people and the Communist Party's desire for cooperation, Marshal Stalin said that they do have such a desire. The newspaper continued: The Soviet socialist state emerged from the war, and it is still very strong and solid. The Stalin Five-Year Plan for rebuilding and developing the national economy shows the world how great the prospects are for the progress of our country's economy, culture, and the improvement of living standards!

　　1947 will appear in history as a year of great breakthroughs on the labor front, with the earliest possible completion of the tasks assigned by the new Stalin Five-Year Plan. The Soviet people will surely achieve new and glorious victories this year, advancing towards communism!

　　战胜德国之后经过一年建设
    苏联更为强壮坚实     
    正向共产主义迈进
    【新华社陕北十一日电】莫斯科讯：苏联全国于五月九日热烈庆祝欧洲胜利日，真理报并发表社论，略称：今天，我们以感激和哀悼的心情，下半旗，向对敌战争中牺牲的英雄男女们致敬！他们为了我们国家的和全人类的自由幸福生活，献出了他们的生命。德国侵略的结果，德国占领和放逐苏联人民到德国作苦工的结果，苏联已不可挽回地在战争中损失了七百万生命。如众周知，苏联的财产所直接遭受的破坏，其损失就达到六千七百九十万万卢布。美国、英国和其他别的国家的某些政治家和闲人，是很想忘掉这些巨大的牺牲的。苏联人民的英勇奋斗和重大的牺牲，保证了完全地战胜希特勒德国。战后各国合作的巩固基础也这样建立起来了。斯大林元帅在接见美国共和党要人史塔生时，谈至两个不同的经济制度合作的可能性和愿望。斯大林元帅说：人们应当把合作的可能性和合作的愿望区别开。合作的可能性是常有的，而合作的愿望却不常有。至于苏联人民及联共对合作的愿望，斯大林元帅说，他们是有这样的愿望的。该报继续写道：苏维埃社会主义国家是从战争中生长出来的，现在仍然很强壮而坚实。重新建设和发展国民经济的斯大林五年计划，向世界显示出，我们国家的经济文化的进步与生活水准提高的前程是多么伟大！
    一九四七年在历史上将以劳动阵线的大突击之年出现，以最早地完成新斯大林五年计划赋与的任务。苏联人民今年定会完成新的辉煌胜利，向共产主义迈进！
