Xinhua News Agency, Eastern Manchuria Front, 25th: Our special correspondent Hua Shan reports: The New First Army's 38th Division, 112th Regiment, which claimed to be skilled in forest warfare, was completely annihilated by the Democratic Allied Forces in the deep mountains southwest of Lord Ridge in less than six hours. The Chiang troops, isolated on the strategically important Lord Ridge for six days, probably felt that the group of fortifications stretching thirty miles, was just a tomb today. So, on the 19th, they hastily abandoned artillery shells and supplies all over the mountains, and with suitcases and permed-hair wives, fled into the deep mountains, planning to shrink back to Xiaofengman on the Songhua River through a hundred miles of dense forest where bears roam. The soldiers, carrying shovels, saws, axes, six-foot-long rice sacks, and clothes given by their American masters, cut down trees and cleared roads all night to escape. But they ran too slowly. At first, they were reluctant to abandon Lord Ridge, which they could not defend, and now they were reluctant to discard the American equipment they could not carry. Although along the way they littered broken shoes, luggage, and duck-down quilts with zippers, they could not travel more than three li in an hour. On the morning of the 21st, they were burying pots to cook when our pursuing vanguard suddenly arrived. The exhausted enemy abandoned the food and ran again. Our vanguard was too far from the main force and did not have time to wait for orders from their superiors. They only knew that the enemy's gunfire was a chasing order. Since there was no road on the mountain, they advanced by climbing trees. When they could not see the enemy beyond fifty meters, they chased fiercely towards the muzzle flashes through the dense forest. When their shoes sank into the mud, they continued to walk with bare feet. After not eating for a night and a half, they drank some cold water and chased them for more than ten li. Finally, near Daping Mountain south of Tiangang, they intercepted the main force of the 112th Regiment. Seven hundred enemies occupied the top of the mountain, relying on the horizontal tree trunks, setting up two heavy machine guns, two 60 mortars, seven light machine guns, and dozens of submachine guns, controlling the only climbable mountain path from a high position. The vanguard, consisting of only two and a half companies, disregarded the shells exploding on the treetops above their heads and charged fiercely against the falling leaves swept by the machine guns. Finally, in two and a half hours of fierce fighting, they captured the mountain top. And our swift attacking forces appeared simultaneously from the south and west, disrupting the enemy's organization and surrounding them in the ten-mile mountain forest. This time, the "Number One Army Under Heaven" did not have the desperate resistance of the Qitaimu battle, nor did they conceal their official positions according to Chiang Kai-shek's orders. Except for the death of the regimental commander Zhang Jie and more than 300 casualties, the rest surrendered in groups. The 112th Regiment was thus completely annihilated in six hours. The "trump card" 38th Division of the Northeast Chiang Army, from then on, only had the 114th Regiment left, becoming a "second-class cripple." Du Yuming's dream of attacking Harbin as a springboard on the eastern front also finally vanished with the abandonment of Lord Ridge and the annihilation of the 112th Regiment.

　　大山林里打狗熊
  　老爷岭逃敌被歼经过
    【新华社东满前线二十五日电】本社特派记者华山报导：自称善于森林作战的新一军三十八师一一二团，不出六小时，便被民主联军尽歼于老爷岭西南的大山林里了。在天险老爷岭孤悬了六天的蒋军，大概也颇感到纵横三十里的集团工事，今天只是一座坟墓而已，所以在十九号匆匆抛下遍山的炮弹辎重，带着皮箱和烫发的老婆逃入深山，打算从狗熊出没的百里密林缩回松花江的小丰满。士兵们带着铁锨、锯子、斧子、六尺长的米袋和美国主子送的衣物，连夜伐木开路逃窜。但是他们跑得太慢了，起初舍不得丢掉守不住的老爷岭，现在又舍不得抛掉背不动的美国装备，虽然沿途狼借着破鞋、行李和带拉练子的鸭绒被子。他们一小时走不出三里地。二十一日上午，他们正在林中埋锅造饭，我追击的先头部队突然到了。疲惫不堪的敌人，抛下伙食担子又跑。我先头部队离开主力太远了，来不及等待上级的命令，他们只知道敌人的枪炮声就是追击命令。山上没有路，他们就攀着树枝前进，五十米以外看不见敌人，他们就朝着经过密林的弹光猛追。鞋子陷到泥里，光着脚板一样走，一宿半天没吃饭，喝口凉水又追了他十几里，终于在天岗南的大平山附近，把一一二团的主力截住了。七百个敌人占住山顶，倚凭横卧的大树杆，架起两挺重机枪，两门六零炮，七挺轻机枪，几十支冲锋式，踞高临下的控制着唯一可以攀登的山道。为数只有两个半连的先头部队，不顾炮弹在头顶上的树杆上炸，迎着机枪扫掉的落叶猛冲，终于在两个半钟头的激战中，夺下山头。而我神速的攻击部队，就在南面和西面同时出现，把敌人的建制打乱，围在十来里的山林中。这次“天下第一军”再没有其塔木战役那样绝望的顽抗，也没有按照蒋介石的命令隐讳自己的官职。除了团长张洁之战死和伤亡三百余人以外，其余的人都成群的放下武器。一一二团就这样的在六小时中全军覆没了。东北蒋军的一张“王牌”三十八师，从此只剩下个一一四团，成了“二等残废”。杜聿明梦想进攻哈尔滨的东线跳板，也随老爷岭的弃守与一一二团的覆灭而最后幻灭了。
