　　Army Postal Model Zhang Dengfang

　　Comrade Zhang Dengfang was transferred to work in the 11th Army Postal Bureau last September. In his half-year of army postal work, he has demonstrated revolutionary enthusiasm and a sense of responsibility in every task, regardless of the harshness of the environment, and has never been concerned about personal gain. When the troops advanced south of the Longhai Railway to fight last time, they were over two hundred li away from the 15th Army Postal Bureau, and the route passed through the KMT-occupied area. Some timid people felt that the journey was long and dangerous and were afraid to set out, but Comrade Zhang Dengfang showed great courage at this time. He often used practical examples to explain to others: "Our army is powerful, and even bad people are afraid of us." Once, he went to the 15th Bureau and stayed overnight in a village along the way. To prevent any trouble at night, he devised a clever method of self-defense: he arranged the livestock feed, fodder, and water in the house, closed the door tightly, buried a hand grenade outside the door, pressed it with a brick, and tied the fuse to the door panel, so that if someone pushed the door, it would explode, and then he would deal with them with a gun. As a result, he was very safe. Our army post was established under extremely difficult material conditions, and the furniture was very incomplete. Comrade Zhang Dengfang tried every means to find solutions. When there were no vehicles or horses, he could run on foot. When there were no baggage, he used hemp ropes and clothes to bundle the mail packages. Previously, we had no livestock. After several victorious battles, the troops replenished us with eight horses, which made the work much more convenient, but at the same time, a lot of miscellaneous tasks such as feeding the livestock were added. Comrade Zhang Dengfang was busy from morning to night, carrying water and cutting grass all day long, and never relied on others. Especially during days of intense marching, when people were tired and horses were exhausted, he could lead by example, letting others sleep, and never being passive in his work. Comrade Zhang Dengfang is gentle, straightforward, and lively, and can unite with anyone. For individuals who are not enthusiastic about their work and have backward ideas, he does not adopt a discriminatory or sarcastic attitude, but rather offers friendly and well-intentioned criticism, patiently helping them to correct their shortcomings. He was recently elected as an "Army Postal Model." Now the whole bureau recognizes him as a role model for everyone to learn from.

　　军邮模范张登方
    张登方同志于去年九月调来军邮十一局工作，在半年来的军邮工作中，无论在任何艰苦环境下，每一件工作上，都表现了革命的积极性和责任心，从未计较过个人的得失。部队上次挺进陇海路南作战时，与十五军邮局遥距二百余里，途中并经过蒋占区，个别胆小的人感到路程远有危险，不敢出发，但张登方同志，在这时却表现很勇敢。他时常用实际例子向别人解释：“我军的威力大，有坏人也得怕三分。”一次他到十五局去，夜间住在中途的一个村子，他防备晚上出岔子，想了一个机巧的自卫办法，把喂牲口的草、料、水都安排在屋子里，关紧门，把手榴弹埋在门外，用砖压住，将火线拴在门板上，如推门，必然爆炸，然后拿枪再对付，结果很安全。我们的军邮是在物质条件极端困难情况下建立的，家具很不完全，张登方同志想尽各种办法，没车没马的时候，他可以徒步跑，没包袱便用麻绳及衣服捆邮包。先前我们没牲口，几次胜利战役后，部队给我们补充了八匹牲口，工作上虽方便的多了，但同时喂牲口等杂碎事也增加了不少，张登方同志从早到晚，担水、割草一天忙个不休，从不依赖别人。特别在连日紧张行军中，人困马疲，他都能以身作则，让别人睡觉，工作上从不被动。张登方同志性情温和，直爽活泼，与任何人都能团结，对于个别工作不起劲，意识落后的人，他不是歧视讽刺的态度，而是友爱善意的批评，耐心帮助改正缺点。在最近当选为“军邮模范”。现在全局公认为他是大家学习的榜样。
