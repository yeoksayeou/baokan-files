Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th. According to a Nanjing dispatch from the Associated Press on the 4th: Luo Longji, Minister of Propaganda of the Democratic League, stated: The Kuomintang's fabricated slander that "the Democratic League is completely controlled by the Communist Party to carry out underground armed rebellion" is a signal for the upcoming planned suppression of the Democratic League and all other democratic groups. Luo said: Everyone is very clear about the purpose of this kind of propaganda. The so-called "Democratic League is controlled by the Communist Party" is complete nonsense.

    【新华社陕北六日电】据美联社南京四日电称：民盟宣传部长罗隆基声称：国民党所谓“民盟完全为共产党控制以进行地下武装叛乱”的造谣诬蔑是即将到来的对民盟与其他所有民主团体有计划镇压之信号。罗氏说：每个人都很清楚此种宣传的目的。所谓“民盟为共产党控制”的话是完全胡说。
