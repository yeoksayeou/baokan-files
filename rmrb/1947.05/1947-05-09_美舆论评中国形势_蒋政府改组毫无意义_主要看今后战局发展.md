Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th: According to US News Agency reports: The US media has commented on the "reorganization" of the Chiang government. The Washington Star stated: "Upon careful examination of the new government structure, we will find that not only does the Kuomintang continue to monopolize power, but control within the Kuomintang remains in the hands of those reactionaries, with Chiang Kai-shek himself occupying the high positions. We can imagine that Chiang Kai-shek will still be the one determining the direction of the new government." It also stated: "Many things may happen before the end of the year, the most notable being the escalating civil war between the Communist and Kuomintang parties." (Implying the victory of the People's Liberation Army and the rapid changes in the Chinese situation.) The Minneapolis Tribune of Minnesota stated: "The bureaucratic Chinese government (Chiang government) has engaged in a 'reorganization' that President Chiang enjoys talking about; obviously, this new adjustment is not much different from the verbal reorganization. National affairs are still in the hands of the previous Kuomintang leaders." The New York Herald Tribune said that the reorganization of the Chiang government was to "win the approval of the United States and to release the aid to China that was temporarily withheld due to the nature of the Nanjing government." Regarding this, the United States should not pay attention to the changes in the Chinese political situation, but should focus on what is happening behind the scenes."

　　美舆论评中国形势
    蒋政府改组毫无意义
    主要看今后战局发展
    【新华社陕北六日电】美新闻处消息：美舆论界对蒋政府“改组”有所评论。华盛顿明星报称：“详细检查新政府组织，我们会发现不但国民党继续独揽大权，而且国民党内部的控制权仍操纵在那些反动分子手里，高踞要位的是蒋介石自己。我们可以设想，决定新政府路线的仍是蒋介石。”又称：“在年底前许多事情可能发生，最令人注意的是国共两党有增无已的内战。”（暗示人民解放军之胜利，越赶中国局势起急剧变化。）明尼索达州明尼波星斯论坛报称：“官僚化的中国政府（蒋政府）已从事蒋主席津津乐道的“改组”；显而易见的，这种新调鏊较口头上的改组相去并不怎样远。国家政事仍在先前那些国民党领袖的掌握中。”纽约先驱论坛报则说：蒋政府改组是为了“博得美国的赞许，而将发放由于南京政府性质而暂时保留的对华援助”。关于这一点，美国应该不必重视中国政治局面的改观，而应该注重幕后的情形。”
