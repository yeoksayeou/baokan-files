Xinhua News Agency, Eastern Manchuria Front, 17th. Our special correspondent Hua Shan reports: After the Eastern Manchuria Democratic Allied Army recovered the Tiangang and Jiangmifeng stations at the foot of Changbai Mountain on the La (fa) Ji (lin) Railway, they took advantage of the victory to point their swords westward and stormed Northern Jilin on the bank of the Songhua River on the morning of the 14th, cutting off the poisonous claws of the Chiang-Du troops extending into the Eastern Manchuria Liberated Area by eighty *li*. The natural barrier of Jilin, the Laoye Ridge, has been relegated to the remote background. Originally, the arrogant New First Army’s 38th Division, after being reduced to "third-class cripples" in the Talamu battle, is now in a state of panic. All its forces along the line have been withdrawn to Jilin, finding the 7th Security Regiment as a scapegoat. A few days ago, seeing that everything was fine, they placed the 112th Regiment on Laoye Ridge, pretending to be "waiting in battle." On the evening of the 11th, our army suddenly appeared at Youjiatun, an advanced stronghold 35 *li* north of Tiangang, and captured the entire company of defending soldiers in five minutes. On the morning of the 13th, Tiangang was attacked, and a battalion of defending soldiers was eliminated in one hour. Jiangmifeng was defended by a regimental headquarters and two battalions, only 40 *li* away from Jilin, but after five hours of fighting, the battle also ended. The captured regimental commander and three battalion commanders of the Security Regiment were all officers of the Changchun Youth Army Training Headquarters and were Du Yuming's fellow villagers, so they had always been highly valued. However, in the forty-odd hours in which the entire regiment was annihilated, they not only did not receive reinforcements from Laoye Ridge or Jilin, but even planes did not come to cheer them on. Changchun simply broadcast "strategic retreat has been carried out," writing off this regiment lightly in a few words. However, this "strategic retreat" of using local troops as scapegoats did not benefit the 38th Division. The strong fortifications it built along the line were all lost by the 7th Security Regiment in one go, and the People's Liberation Army could line up in three columns and come in a mighty manner along the flat highway. As of the evening of the 14th, the Democratic Allied Army, with the momentum of a whirlwind sweeping away the remnants, recovered important strongholds on the east bank of the Songhua River, such as the Northern Jilin Chemical Factory, Hadawan, Datun, Qipanjie, and Xiaocaipeng, and overlooked the Dalazi Village and Longtan Mountain in the Jilin urban area across the river. The 113th Regiment, which was pieced together after being annihilated by us in the winter offensive, is now in danger of falling into the Talamu predicament again. Jilin, an important town in Eastern Manchuria that was captured by the Chiang-Du troops last May, is now exposed to the Liberation Army across the river, and the 112th Regiment, which is isolated on Laoye Ridge, can only make a "strategic retreat" on the Kuomintang's radio.

　　松江东岸收复北吉林
    我军隔江俯瞰吉林市
    【新华社东满前线十七日电】本社特派记者华山报导：东满民主联军于拉（法）吉（林）铁路收复长白山麓的天岗、江密峰两车站后，乘胜挥戈西指，于十四日晨直捣松花江岸的北吉林，把蒋杜军伸入东满解放区的毒螯齐根截掉八十里，吉林的屏障天险老爷岭，已被遥远地方到一边。本来，骄气十足的新一军三十八师在其塔木战役打成“三等残废”以后，现在闹的风声鹤唳，沿线兵力全部缩回了吉林，找了个保安第七团作替死鬼。前几天看着没事，又把一一二团放在老爷岭，装出“严阵以待”的架势。十一号黄昏，我军突然出现于天岗北三十五里的前沿据点尤家屯，五分钟俘虏了全连守军。十三日晨打天岗，一小时解决守军一个营。江密峰由一个团部和两个营守备，离吉林也只四十里，但是打了五个钟头，也结束战斗了。被俘的保安团团长和三个营长都是长春青年军训练总队的军官，又是杜聿明的同乡，所以向来很被重视。但是在全团先后被歼灭尽的四十余小时中，不但得不到老爷岭或吉林方面的增援，连飞机也不到他们头上助威，长春只简单广播“已作战略撤退”，几句话把这一团轻轻的一笔勾销了。但是这种拿地方部队作替死鬼的“战略撤退”，并没有叫三十八师占了便宜，它在沿线修筑的强固工事，都被保七团一气丢光，人民解放军便可以排成三路纵队，顺着平坦的公路浩荡而来。战至十四日黄昏为止，民主联军以疾风卷残云之势，恢复松花江东岸的北吉林化学工厂、哈达湾、大屯、棋盘街、小菜棚等重要据点，隔江俯瞰吉林市区的大喇子屯和龙潭山。守备东岸的一一三团这个在冬季攻势中被我歼灭后才拚凑起来的老番号，现在又有重陷其塔木厄连的危险。蒋杜军去年五月侵陷的东满重镇吉林，已隔江裸露于解放军的面前，孤守老爷岭的一一二团，也只有到国民党的广播机里作“战略撒退”。
