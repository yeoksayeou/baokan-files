　　Victory is No Accident
　　Zeng Ke
　　Wang Jibin, acting regimental commander of the 146th Regiment of the Rapid Column, is now sitting here calmly talking to us. Like the entire brigade of Chiang's army who were liberated, he is grateful that he is still alive and is being treated with leniency. Yesterday morning, he was still trembling in the flames and gunfire of Dahu Camp. He repeatedly said that his mood is now calm and that fear has been banished from his mind. He lit a cigarette and slowly moved his mouth, saying:
　　"People's thoughts are truly a strange thing. In the past, many people, after arriving on your side, would declare that their thinking had changed in a year and a half, or even a month and twenty days, and that they were moved by many of your actions, which I found very confusing." He tapped the ash off his cigarette with his gold-ringed middle finger, raised his voice a little and said, "But after only a day and a night, I truly saw some things – the fundamental things that enable you to win, and only then did I believe that my life was guaranteed."
　　"Please tell us about the process of change in your inner feelings, without any restraint or reservation. Yesterday, on the battlefield, we were shooting at each other with firepower, as enemies, and bullets are not polite. Now that you have laid down your weapons, we can exchange any different political opinions, which is also a consistent principle of our Communist Party. Force cannot control people's thoughts, so we have never been willing to solve problems with brutal slaughter," we said.
　　His deeply wrinkled forehead furrowed, revealing a sense of world-weariness, and he said:
　　"When I was captured, I was prepared to die. I just hoped I could die quickly and without being humiliated. The soldiers shouted 'Those who surrender will not be killed, prisoners will be treated with leniency,' but I didn't believe it at all. However, when they brought me down from the burning building, they really didn't touch me at all. And they spoke very politely. I took off my fountain pen and watch and gave them to one of the escorts, hoping he wouldn't harm me, but he refused. He said: 'The Eighth Route Army doesn't want prisoners' personal belongings!' Even now, my ring is still on my finger." He held up his hand to show us: "Before I came here, I had been transferred to four or five different places. Everyone who escorted and received me said the same thing. So, I thought to myself: if they are faking it, how can so many people fake it in the same way? Is it forced training to do this? There would always be some forced awkwardness in their spirit. So, I believed in your policy of treating prisoners with leniency."
　　"Every policy of the Communist Party is implemented after understanding the thoughts of the masses. Wherever you go: the New Fourth Army, the Eighth Route Army, the Democratic Allied Army are all the same. You can slowly learn more about it."
　　"Yes! What one of your soldiers says is just like what you say. Their power is not passively generated, your power is based on the lower levels, so your victory is no accident!"
　　We all laughed. This laughter made him suspicious, and he revealed his true feelings, saying:
　　"Don't think that I am being obsequious and flattering because I am a prisoner. What I have seen, I am willing to say."
　　"We welcome this attitude of yours."
　　"Seeing your officers and soldiers getting along like a family also moved me, who has been leading troops for many years."
　　"This is because we are all moving forward for the same goal, and our highest relationship is that of comrades. This is the same reason why many of you who have come over are surprised that one of our soldiers dares to casually call Mao Zedong 'Comrade'," we explained.
　　There was a hint of a smile on his face as he said:
　　"It is completely impossible to do that in the Kuomintang army. There, everything depends on orders and discipline, but even any order or discipline cannot be implemented."
　　"What do you think of our mass discipline?"
　　"To be honest, the Kuomintang army has now become like the Northern Warlords during the Great Revolution. Wherever the army goes, it leaves a trail of devastation! It has completely lost the hearts of the people! And you have become the revolutionary army of that time's new forces. The fact is like this, and no force can reverse it!" He clenched his fist and emphasized again: "My age makes my mind relatively stubborn. But, I can remember the facts I have experienced. During the Great Revolution, wherever your people led, there was development and victory. In fact, this world was won by you!"
　　Regimental Commander Wang Jibin is a man in his forties. It is said that he was a student in the fourth class of the military academy. We respect his spirit of daring to face reality. He constantly took out the "Self-Defense Frontline" that we gave him from his pocket and said:
　　"I hope you can give me more things to read! If my stubborn mind can be slowly transformed, I am willing to contribute my meager strength!"

　　胜利不是偶然的
    曾克
    快速纵队一四六团代团长王吉彬，现在安然的坐在这里和我们谈话了。他和全旅被解放的蒋军一样，庆幸自己还能活着，还受优待。昨天清晨，他还颤抖在大胡营的火光和炮声中。他再三的说，现在的心情是平静的，恐惧已经从他思想里摆脱开。他抽燃一根纸烟，嘴巴慢慢张动着说：
    “人的思想真是一件奇怪的东西。过去，有很多人，到了你们这方面，一年半载甚至一月二十天，就声言思想变了，被你们很多事情感动，我都非常疑惑。”他用戴着金戒指的中指弹了弹烟灰，声音放高一点又说：“我可只经过一天一夜的时间，的确也看到了一些东西——使你们能够胜利的基本的东西，我这才相信自己的生命有了保障。”
    “请你把内心情感变化的过程谈给我们听，一点不要拘束保留。昨天在战场上，我们互相用火力射击，那是敌人，枪弹是不讲客气的。你既然放下武器，现在，我们可以交换任何不同的政治意见，这也是我们共产党一贯的主张。武力控制不住人的思想，所以我们从来不愿意用凶暴屠杀来解决问题。”我们说。
    他那堆集着深深皱纹的额头一皱，流露出饱经世故的沧桑之感说：
    “我做了俘虏，原是准备死的。只是盼望能死得痛快一些，并且人格不要受到侮辱。战士们喊着缴枪不杀优待俘虏，我完全不相信会有这回事。但是，他们把我从烟火的楼上带下来，真是没有动我一下。并且说话都很客气。我把钢笔和手表取下，给一个押送我的人，企图他不要糟害我，被他拒绝了。他说：“八路军不要俘虏私人的东西！一直到现在，我的戒指还戴在这里。”他举手给我们看：“到你们这里以前，我已经转移四五个地方了。每一个押送和接见我的人，都向我说着一样的道理。于是，我心里就暗暗的想：他们如果是做假，难道这多的人都假得一样？强迫训练成这一套吧？精神总会免强生硬。所以，我就相信了你们优待俘虏的政策。”
    “共产党的每一个政策，都是通过群众思想了解以后才执行的。无论到那里：新四军，八路军，民主联军都是一样。你慢慢的就可以多了解一些。”
    “是呀！你们一个兵所讲的就跟你们一样。他们的力量就不是被动发出来的，你们的力量基于下层，所以，你们的胜利就不是偶然的！”
    我们都笑了。这笑使他发生了怀疑，他剖白自己说：
    “你们不要以为我因为做了阶下囚，在这摇尾乞怜的表示谄媚，我见到的，我愿意把他说出来。”
    “我们欢迎你这种态度。”
    “看见你们官兵相处像一家人，也使我带兵多年的人，有所感动。”
    “这是因为我们都是为着一个目标前进，我们最高的关系是同志。这和你们很多过来的人，奇怪我们一个战士敢随口称呼毛泽东同志是一个道理。”我们解释着。
    他脸上有了一点笑意说：
    “在国民党部队里，是完全不可能做到的。那里一切是靠命令纪律，但，任何命令与纪律也贯彻不下去。”
    “你对你们的群众纪律怎么样看？”
    “老实说吧，国民党的军队现在已经变成了大革命时候的北洋军阀一样啦，军行所至，赤地千里！已经完全失掉了人心！而你们，成了那时新生力量的革命军，事实是这样，没有什么力量可以扭转它！”他攒起了拳头，又强调的表示：“我的年龄使我的头脑比较顽固。但，我可以记得经历的事实。大革命时，那里有你们的人领导，那里就有发展有胜利。实际上这个天下是你们打下来的呵！”
    王吉彬团长是个四十多岁的人，据说他是军校四期的学生，我们尊重他敢于正视现实的精神。他不时的从口袋里掏出我们送的“自卫前线”说：
    “希望多给我些东西看！如果我的顽固头脑可以慢慢转变，我还愿意供献自己微薄的力量！”
