　　Korean-Soviet-American Joint Commission Resumes Work
  　Koreans Eagerly Await Establishment of Democratic Government
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th] TASS, Moscow: The Korean-Soviet-American Joint Commission resumed work in Seoul on May 21st. At the first meeting, General Shtykov, head of the Soviet delegation, spoke, emphasizing that the Korean people’s reaction to the decision of the Soviet and American governments to resume the work of the Joint Commission showed strong political enthusiasm. He also stated: “The Korean people are eagerly awaiting the earliest implementation of the Moscow Conference’s resolution on the Korean issue, first and foremost, their establishment of a provisional Korean democratic government, which further increases the responsibility of the Joint Commission in completing its work. In the area under the responsibility of the Soviet Army Command in northern Korea, since the expulsion of Japanese imperialism, significant progress has been made in the field of democratization and in the development of the national economy and culture. We deeply know that, based on the Moscow resolution, Korea will move forward along the democratic path, become an independent nation, and join the great family of peace-loving nations around the world as an equal member. The Soviet delegation recognizes the great importance of the entire responsibility borne by the Joint Commission and will make every effort to implement the Moscow Conference's resolution on Korea as soon as possible and strictly."

　　朝鲜苏美联合委员会恢复工作
  　鲜人急盼建立民主政府
    【新华社陕北二十五日】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：朝鲜苏美联合委员会，已于五月廿一日在汉城恢复工作。首次会议上苏联代表团团长希蒂科夫将军发言着重指出朝鲜人民对于苏美两国政府决定联合委员会恢复工作的反应，表现了强烈的政治热情。并称：“朝鲜人民急切地等待着尽早实行莫斯科会议关于朝鲜问题的决议，首先是他们建立临时的朝鲜民主政府，这就更增加联合委员会在完成工作上所负的责任。在鲜北苏军司令部负责的区域内，自从驱逐日本帝国主义以来，已经在民主化的领域里和国民经济与文化的发展上做出了重大的进步。我们深知，基于莫斯科决议，朝鲜将循着民主的路线向前发展，变成独立国家，参加全世界爱好和平之民族的大家庭，作为一个平等的成员。苏联代表团认识联合委员会所负之整个责任的重大，将用尽一切努力，以求尽早并且严格地实行莫斯科会议关于朝鲜的决议。”
