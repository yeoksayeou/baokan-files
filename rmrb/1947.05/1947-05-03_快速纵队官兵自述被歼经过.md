　　Officers and Soldiers of the Rapid Column Recount Their Annihilation
    Fang De
    Chiang Kai-shek's trump card—the Rapid Second Column—was annihilated. The officers and soldiers who laid down their weapons all spoke with self-deprecating tones about their miserable annihilation.
    Chen Jinling, a soldier who had followed Li Shouzheng for three years, told me a story about Li Shouzheng's speech mobilizing the troops when they set out from Xinxiang: "This time we must be resolute in fighting the 'bandits.' If you are captured, don't mention which unit you belong to. If two acquaintances are captured at the same time, you don't mention me, and I won't mention you." This was clearly telling people to be captured, not to fight. When the deputy adjutant of the brigade headquarters saw Deputy Brigade Commander Jiang Tiexiong among the prisoners, he only said, "Reporting, sir, I'm here!" Zhang Zhibu, the radio station chief, recounted a story about the attack on Yigou: "Commander-in-Chief Wang (referring to Wang Zhonglian) ordered the troops to capture Yigou on the 10th and to camp in Yigou. He even personally came to Dalai Dian (more than ten miles north of Qi County) to give us a pep talk. The 145th Regiment, with its tanks and trucks, failed to capture it (Editor's note: At that time, the People's Liberation Army only had four companies defending Yigou). Instead, they retreated overnight. When the brigade commander reported to headquarters, Wang, the chief of the operations section at headquarters, replied: 'Liu Bocheng is in charge in Yigou (Editor's note: At that time, a regiment commander of the People's Liberation Army was in command of the operation), with at least five columns. It was right to retreat; if you hadn't, you would have been finished long ago.' When the main force retreated, I heard that your two companies beat our regiment to a pulp. From then on, we were terrified at the sound of gunfire. In Weixianji, at dusk, we fought with the 66th Division. We were shooting at each other, which was really laughable!" Wang Zhicheng talked about the embarrassing situation during the second northern invasion: "On the 16th, we advanced to Zhaicun and encountered resistance. At 1:00 PM, we received the order to retreat. Everyone felt uneasy. Some soldiers said, 'The Rapid Death Column, it's time to die!' With such morale, we still had to cover the division headquarters' retreat. We barely held out in Zhonggang until 10:00 AM the next day and had to run south. Your (referring to the People's Liberation Army) troops followed closely. As soon as you charged, our troops were in chaos, with officers unable to find their soldiers, and superiors unable to find their subordinates. We ran into the small and large Huying, and before we could even get our footing, you attacked and surrounded us tightly. The original plan to advance through the hilly areas between the Qi River and the Wei River was to avoid being caught in a pocket, but we still ended up in one." Chen Jinling also described the situation when they were surrounded: "As soon as the artillery fire started, the large building in the east of the village collapsed, and the entire engineer company was buried inside. I accompanied the brigade commander to a tall building in the west, and the deputy brigade commander and regimental commander thought it was safe here. But it was so crowded that one grenade could knock down more than a dozen people, and one shell could knock down dozens. At that time, we couldn't even tell what kind of artillery it was, it was just boom, boom, boom!" Zhang Zhong continued, "The gunfire was so intense that the radio antenna couldn't be erected, and the telephone lines were out of the question. The brigade commander sat silently in the room, and the situation was extremely serious. Finally, he got through to the division headquarters, but he only said a few words because he was afraid of exposing the target, and he didn't even dare to crank the generator too much." Chen Jinling also told me about Li Shouzheng's capture. He said, "At 5:00 AM on the 17th, your artillery fire came in from behind us, and the entire radio operating team was wiped out. Deputy Director Fang Chengyan's eyeballs were blown out. Deputy Brigade Commander Yuan's legs were injured by flying bricks. Your grenades were thrown in one after another. Deputy Brigade Commander Jiang's left leg was blown off. Brigade Commander Li was wounded in three places. Those who were still alive hurriedly climbed upstairs to change their clothes, preparing to become prisoners. Deputy Brigade Commander Yuan changed into a lieutenant's uniform on top and wore a soldier's yellow cloth pants on the bottom. Deputy Brigade Commander Jiang even lost his American-style jacket and dressed up like a weirdo. Seeing this, Brigade Commander Li said, 'What's the point of fighting? There's no one leading the charge.' So he threw his gun down. Later, when you shouted to surrender, the guns upstairs were thrown downstairs, and the guns downstairs were thrown out of the holes in the wall. At that time, no one cared about anyone else, and no one was willing to die for Chiang Kai-shek." The reporter also asked Wang Zhicheng why the armored cars, tanks, and howitzer vehicles did not follow the column's command post. He humorously replied, "Because they came quickly and left even faster. If they hadn't run away, they would have ended up like us." The reporter also asked, "Why didn't we see the air force or infantry supporting us during the daytime battle?" He said, "We were assigned to the 66th Division. At that time, they were too busy saving their own lives to care about us. How could they have cared about sending planes? Not to mention their infantry reinforcements."

　　快速纵队官兵自述被歼经过
    方德
    蒋介石的这张王牌——快速第二纵队被歼灭了，放下武器的官兵们，都用自嘲的口吻谈论着他们惨遭歼灭的经过。
    跟随李守正三年的弁兵陈金灵告诉我一段关于李守正在新乡出发动员部队的讲演：“这回打‘匪军’要坚决。万一被捉住了，不要说是那个部队。两个相识的同时被捉住，你不说我，我不说你。”这明明是叫人当俘虏，而不是叫人打仗的。旅部副官处的副官在俘虏群里见到副旅长蒋铁雄时，只说：“报告官长，我来了！”李守正的话报台长张志甫说了一段进攻宜沟的故事：“王总司令（按即王仲廉）叫部队十号攻下宜沟，就在宜沟宿营，他还亲自到大赉店（淇县北十几里）来打过一回气。带战车、坐汽车的一四五团没有攻下来（记者按：当时解放军守宜沟只有四个连），反而连夜回撤。旅长给总部报告时，总部作战科王科长回答：‘刘伯承坐镇宜沟（记者按：解放军当时是一个团长在指挥作战），至少带了五个纵队，退回来是对的，不退你们早完了。’大军后撤时，听说你们两个连把我们一个团打的唏哩哗啦，从此一听枪响就心惊胆裂。在魏贤集，黄昏时候，和六十六师干了一家伙，自己打自己，真够笑死人！”王志成谈及第二次北犯溃退时的狼狈样子说：“十六日前进到翟村，遭受抵抗；午后一时得到后撤使命，大家感到不妙，有的士兵说：‘快死纵队，该快死呀！’这样的士气还要担任掩护师部后撤任务，在中岗一带勉强坚持到第二天十点钟，不得不向南跑。你们（指解放军）部队紧跟着就来了。你们一冲，我们部队就乱了，弄的官抓不住兵，上级抓不到下级，跑进大小胡营，还没站稳脚跟，你们就打进来了，包围的紧紧的，原来选择淇河、卫河间一带岗坡地前进，就是为了避免钻进口袋，结果还是钻进口袋了。”陈金灵又给我描写了被围时的情形：“炮火一打，村东头大楼院被打塌了，工兵连全压死在里面。我陪着旅长到西边一座高楼房里，副旅长、团长都认为这里保险。但是人挤得满满的，一个手榴弹就打倒十几个，一颗炮弹打倒好几十。那阵子也分不出是啥炮，一直轰，轰，轰！”张忠接着说：“枪也打得那样紧，话报机的天线就没法架，电话线更不用说了。旅长呆坐在屋里一声不响，情形万分严重。最后才和师部叫通了，但也只讲了几句，因为怕暴露目标，连马达也不许多摇。”陈金灵又告诉我李守正被俘的情形，他说：“十七号的摸五点钟，你们的炮火从我们后面打进来了，摇机班全打光了，旅部副官方成彦把眼珠子都打出来了。袁副旅长腿子被飞砖碰伤了，你们的手榴弹接二连三扔进来，蒋副旅长左腿被炸坏了，李旅长身上伤了三处。活着的都仓仓忙忙地爬上楼换衣服，准备当俘虏。袁副旅长上面换了件尉官衣服，下边穿了一条士兵的黄布裤子。蒋副旅长连美式夹衣也丢了，都扮成个四不像。李旅长看这个样子也说：打啥？没有打头了。把枪都扔下去。后来你们一喊缴枪，楼上的枪往楼下扔，楼下的枪往墙洞外面扔，那时候谁也不顾谁，谁也不给蒋介石卖命了。”记者又和王志成谈及装甲汽车、战车、榴弹炮车为什么不跟纵队指挥部？他很幽默地回答：“因为它来时快，去时更快，要不跑掉，当然和我们一样过来了。”记者又问：“为什么在白天战斗不见空军，也不见步兵来支援？”他说：“我们配属六十六师，那时他们自己逃命都来不及，丢下我们不管了，那里还顾得上要飞机？更不用说他们的步兵来增援了。”
