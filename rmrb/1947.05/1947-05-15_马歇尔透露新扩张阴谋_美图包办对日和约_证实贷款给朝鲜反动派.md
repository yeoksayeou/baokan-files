Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th: Comprehensive reports: In Marshall's press conference on the 7th, although he was evasive on some issues, he still revealed a lot about the US imperialists' expansionist ambitions and new conspiracies. He said that the US State Department is considering establishing an agency to draft a plan for the Japanese peace treaty, showing the US's eagerness to monopolize the Japanese peace treaty issue. The long-rumored US plan to grant loans to Korean reactionaries has been confirmed by Marshall. He said, "The State Department will soon submit to Congress a plan to provide financial assistance to Korea." It is reported that the loan amount is 540 million US dollars. As for the loan to France, he was tight-lipped and avoided talking about it. He also said: "The United States has not received requests for financial assistance from Egypt or India." It seems he still wants to keep some secrets from the gentlemen of Downing Street in London for the time being, but this is also a "pot calling the kettle black" statement. Marshall also said in the tone of a new master: the United States "hopes that the Greek government will develop into an ideal government." The so-called "ideal" is nothing more than wanting the Greek reactionaries to submit to the "big stick." This is in line with the rumors that the US ambassador to Greece is discussing a partial reorganization of the government with the Greek authorities. Regarding the Pan-American Conference, Marshall said: "It is currently under study." When a reporter asked about "standardization of armaments in the Western Hemisphere," he kept it secret.

　　马歇尔透露新扩张阴谋
    美图包办对日和约
    证实贷款给朝鲜反动派
    【新华社陕北十二日电】综合报导：马歇尔于七日记者招待会的谈话中，关于若干问题虽半吞半吐，但美帝国主义之扩张野心与新的阴谋活动，仍复暴露不少。彼谓美国务院正考虑成立机构草拟对日和约之计划，显示美国亟谋包办对日和约问题之企图。传说已久之美将予朝鲜反动派贷款计划，马歇尔已予证实。彼谓：“国务院即将以予韩财政援助之计划提交国会。”闻该项贷款数额为五亿四千万元。至于对法贷款问题，彼则讳莫如深，避而不谈。彼又谓：“美国方面并未接到埃及或印度财政援助之请求。”似乎还想暂时对伦敦唐宁街的绅士们保守一点秘密，其实这也是“此地无银三百两”的声明。马歇尔并以新主子的口气说道：美国“希望希腊政府将发展成为一个合于理想的政府。”所谓“合于理想”，无非是要希腊反动派俯首听命于“大棒”之下而已。此与美驻希大使正和希腊当局商议局部改组政府之风传，是一脉相通的。关于举行泛美洲会议问题，马歇尔称：“现正研究中”。有记者问到“西半球军备标准化”一事，他就秘而不宣了。
