　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th. Comprehensive report: The Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference, which opened on March 10th and closed on April 24th, lasted a total of 46 days, holding 44 meetings to discuss the preparatory procedures for the German peace treaty, the draft Austrian peace treaty, and the financial and economic issues of Trieste. The conference only achieved some minor agreements. Throughout the conference, the US imperialists' attempts to undermine the Crimean and Potsdam agreements were exposed everywhere, further confirming to all peace-loving countries and people that only the Soviet Union is the true defender of the Crimean and Potsdam agreements and world peace and security.

　　On many important issues, the US delegation forced the representatives of other countries to submit to American opinions, leading to deadlocks and the failure to reach agreements. For example, in the discussion of the preparatory procedures for the German peace treaty, the US representative consistently attempted to revise the principles of the Potsdam Agreement. Consequently: (1) On the issue of reparations, he was only satisfied with the gold and resources that the US had already transported from Germany and was unwilling to abide by the Crimean and Potsdam resolutions to give reasonable compensation to the Soviet Union, which had suffered the most losses and made the greatest contribution in the anti-fascist war. He wanted to reduce Germany's $10 billion in reparations to the Soviet Union and did not recognize payment of reparations from current German industrial production. (2) On the issue of the provisional political structure of Germany, he also abandoned the principles of the Potsdam Agreement, stubbornly insisting on his so-called "federalization" in an attempt to use divided "state governments" to prevent the reconstruction of a democratic and unified Germany. (3) On the issue of German territory, he supported France's dismemberment of the Saar region, while constantly clamoring for the re-discussion and modification of the provisional new German-Polish border, which had already been decided at the Potsdam Conference. Regarding the Ruhr military-industrial region, the source of German militarism, he strived for joint US-British monopoly and the protection of Germany's reactionary financial oligarchs, thereby vigorously opposing the Soviet Union's proposal for four-power joint control of the Ruhr. (4) In his proposed "Four-Power Treaty on the Disarmament and Demilitarization of Germany," the US also left room for the revival of German militarism everywhere. He resolutely disagreed with the Soviet Union's suggestion that, in addition to disarmament and demilitarization, all German monopolistic capital must be eliminated and land reform must be implemented to thoroughly destroy the economic foundation of German militarism, and that Germany must be thoroughly democratized to eradicate German militarism ideologically.

　　In the discussion of the draft Austrian peace treaty, the US delegation, on the one hand, verbally clamored for the reconstruction of an independent and democratic Austria, but on the other hand, vigorously supported the British proposal that the United Nations (mainly Britain and the United States) should seize huge amounts of compensation from Austria, attempting to use a heavy chain of compensation to bind Austria's financial independence and thereby control its internal affairs. The US delegation completely forgot the Potsdam Agreement: the US, Britain, and the Soviet Union would not demand any compensation from Austria. Regarding the definition of German assets in Austria, the US delegation also attempted to distort and narrow its scope, trying to transfer the funds of German monopolistic capital in Austria to the American and British monopolistic capitalists, those Austrian Quislings who colluded with the Germans during the period of the German-Austrian merger, and reactionary capitalists. The result would render the Potsdam Conference agreement to give German assets in Austria to the Soviet Union as compensation a mere scrap of paper. On the issue of the Austrian border, the US representative also opposed Yugoslavia's reasonable demands for Carinthia. All of this proves that the US is responsible for the failure of this Foreign Ministers' Conference to achieve major agreements.

### 外长会议仅获次要决议  美国反动面貌处处暴露

　　外长会议仅获次要决议  美国反动面貌处处暴露
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】综合报导：莫斯科外长会议自三月十日开幕至四月二十四日闭全共计四十六天，前后举行了四十四次会议，讨论了对德和约准备程序、对奥和约草案和的里亚斯特财政经济等问题。会议只获得了某些次要的协议。整个会议过程中处处暴露了美帝国主义对于克里米亚、波茨顿协议等的破坏企图，更向一切爱好和平的国家与人民，再一次的证实，只有苏联才是维护克里米亚、波茨顿协议及世界和平与安全的真正捍卫者。
    美代表团在许多重要问题上，都是强迫其他国家代表服从美国意见，致使问题无法获致协议而陷于僵局。例如在对德和约准备程序讨论中，美代表一贯企图修改波茨顿协议的原则，因而：（一）在赔偿问题上他就只满足自己已经从德国运走的黄金和资财，而不愿遵守克里米亚和波茨顿决议。给予在反法西斯战争中遭受损失最重出力最大的苏联以合理的赔偿，要减低德国对苏的一百万万美元的赔偿额，不承认自目前德国工业生产中支付赔偿。（二）在德国临时政治机构问题上，亦复抛弃波茨顿协议的原则，顽固地坚持其所谓“联邦化”，图以分裂的“州政权”阻止重建民主统一的德国。（三）在德国领土问题上支持法国对萨尔的支解，而对波茨顿会议中早已决定的德波临时新边界，却不断叫嚣要重新讨论和修改。对于德国军国主义之策源地的鲁尔军需工业地区，力图美英联合垄断与卵翼德国的反动金融寡头们，从而竭力反对苏联主张四强共管鲁尔的建议。（四）在其所提之“四强解除德国军备与军政条约草案”中，美国也处处为德国军国主义的复活留下余地，坚决不赞同苏联的建议，即除了解除军备军政以外，还须消灭德国一切独占资本、实行土地改革，俾得以从经济上彻底摧毁德国军国主义的基础，并须使德国彻底民主化，从思想上根绝德国军国主义。
    在对奥和约草案的讨论中，美代表团一方面在口头上也嚷着重建独立民主的奥国，另一方面却竭力支持英国关于联合国（主要是英美）要向奥国夺取巨额赔偿的建议，企图利用一条赔偿的沉重锁链来束缚奥国的财政独立权，从而控制其内政。美代表团完全忘记了波茨顿协议：美英苏不向奥国索取任何赔偿。关于德国在奥资产的定义，美国代表团也力图加以歪曲而缩小其范围，设法使德国独占资本在奥的资财转入美英独占资本家的那些在德奥合并时期与德国人勾结的奥国吉斯林分子，和反动资本家手中。其结果将使波茨顿会议中，关于以德国在奥资财给予苏联当作赔偿的协议，成为一纸空文。在奥国边境问题上，美代表也反对南斯拉夫对于卡伦地亚的合理要求。这一切都证明：此次外长会议之所以未能获得重大协议，美国是应负责的。
