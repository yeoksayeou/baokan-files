　　Unified Scoring for Participation in War and Agricultural Sidelines
    Xia Village Participates in Mutual Aid
    [This newspaper's report from Licheng] Labor heroes Wang Fengqi and Wang Jinming of Xia Village, adapting to the new situation, have rectified and expanded their mutual aid organizations. The entire village of more than 170 households is organized into seven groups, the largest with 36 households and the smallest with 15 households. These are further divided into subgroups for activities. Only the six or seven households of landlords who were overthrown are still undergoing transformation. After precise calculation, a method of combining agricultural sideline production with war service was developed. For example, in the integration of agriculture and sideline occupations, Wang Fengqi's group originally had one cotton ginning machine. The four people involved, in terms of profit sharing, receive 55 percent for labor and 45 percent for capital. Work points are uniformly established, uniformly entered and distributed, and dividends are distributed according to work points. Ten points are the standard, and agricultural production is for their own consumption. To reward engagement in sideline occupations, those who go out to work, in addition to earning points, receive one jin of flour as a bonus for returning on the same day, and two jin of flour for staying overnight. Livestock receives ten points for carrying four big dou, and twelve points for five big dou. One jin of beans is given as a bonus for returning on the same day, and half a jin of beans is added for staying overnight. Ginning cotton is a heavier task, worth twelve points. Twenty percent is drawn from this to reward surplus labor, ten percent to reward activists, and seventy percent is distributed based on the number of points earned. Wang Jinming's group (divided into six subgroups) has 36 households, 39 full laborers, three half laborers, 27 draft animals, and 751.7 mu of land. After calculation, two people were selected to drive two large carts year-round for transportation, and four people and two livestock were fixed to take turns running an oil press, with a share capital of 70,000 yuan. The remaining laborers cultivate an average of more than 25 mu of land each, and each draft animal cultivates an average of more than 60 mu. The oil press master receives 14 points, the second master 12 points (rewarding technical personnel), and the accountant, whose labor is not strong, receives five points (but receives an extra two dou of rice per month, and two dou of wheat every four months). The purchasing agent receives 12 points per day (a bonus of two points), and livestock are still scored according to the standard. Those involved in transportation have their living expenses reimbursed, and livestock are given work points (15 points for one animal, 14 points for another), and the large cart receives 35 points. Transportation profits are divided 70 percent for labor and 30 percent for capital, with 5 percent awarded as a bonus. Some agricultural tasks are worth ten points and some are worth eight points, with ten points equivalent to one work-day, and one work-day equivalent to ten jin of rice, with dividends distributed according to points. In terms of combining war service, Wang Jinming's group earns points based on agricultural work even when they are dispatched for external service, with a bonus of one point for two days, and an additional two points per day for more than three days. The same applies to participating in the war; however, those who perform well and are active receive extra points, which encourages enthusiasm for participating in the war. Children who deliver letters or stand guard for others, in addition to the points they should receive, have two points deducted from the person they are replacing and awarded to the children. Wang Fengqi's group gives the original points to those who return on the same day, 13 points to those who stay overnight, 15 points to those who drive two livestock, and 17 points to those who drive three, with 17 points for draft animals. Participating in the war earns twelve points per day. Two types of work points are uniformly established: regular and temporary. Those who are not of age do not receive temporary work points, but they still receive points for the work they do. Agricultural sideline occupations and war service are unified with the same work points, the same value, and the same scoring, with dividends distributed according to points. In the most recent statistics, Wang Jinming's group transported coal once, with only five people going with thirteen livestock. The round trip took four days, saving 32 work-days. The whole village dispatched 47 livestock, with 26 people going, saving 21 people and 84 work-days. (Chang Qun)
