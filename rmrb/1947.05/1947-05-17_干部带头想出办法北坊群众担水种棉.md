　　【Reporting from Licheng by our newspaper】 North Fang cadres discussed carrying water to plant cotton on May 3rd. Everyone agreed that the weather was getting hotter and the festival was getting later, so they could not wait for rain and had to hurry to plant. They also discussed the method of planting with night soil, one load of night soil and three loads of water. This way, the soil is loose and the seedlings are easy to survive. When burying the nests, they should be higher than the ground, so the mounds are not afraid of drying out. When the seedlings emerge, they should be harrowed again. Cotton seeds should be soaked in cold water to germinate or steamed in hot water to germinate and planted in the ground quickly to save water. After in-depth research and discussion, they went deep into the masses to mobilize them. Under the leadership of cadres and activists, they organized all the village's livestock to cultivate the land from the 4th, and began planting on the 5th. In five days to the 9th, the whole village planted 140 mu of cotton. Even Lian Jintang Group, which originally planned to plant 8 mu, planted a total of 10.2 mu under the promotion of Jin Tang. The masses said happily: "If we had just waited for rain, we would still be staring blankly." "If we hadn't organized, it wouldn't have been so fast." Special attention was paid to absorbing auxiliary labor to participate in cotton planting. Work points were issued for the whole work, one day's work was worth ten points, and old men and children dug nests, planted seeds, and poured water, mostly worth eight or six points. Work points were evaluated and issued on the same day. The cotton planting has now ended, and each group has selected cotton planting heroes. The enthusiasm of cadres and the masses is very high, and they plan to carry water to plant "Golden Queen" and "Soil Jade Corn" in a concentrated effort, using the energy of cotton planting to complete the planting of jade corn.

　　【Reporting from Pingshun by our newspaper】 Shannan Di Village in the First District had a cotton planting plan set by household this spring, totaling 90 mu for the whole village. Only 50 mu were planted before the rain, and they were worried that the seedlings would not emerge. On May 1st, there were two rains, and the enthusiasm of the masses immediately increased. The village cadres took advantage of this momentum and convened a meeting of mutual aid team leaders to mobilize more cotton planting by group. As a result, it was very effective. In the concentrated planting, women and children were mobilized to participate. The whole village not only completed the original plan of 90 mu in the two or three days, but also over-planted 70 mu.

　　【Reporting from Jinnan by our newspaper on the 14th】 The production movement in Xiaozhai, Jize, was launched after the village cadres personally connected and organized and solved production difficulties. The whole village has ten oxen and twelve donkeys, and 2,483 mu of autumn land, which is very difficult to cultivate. The village proposed a method of pooling money to buy cattle, but most groups were worried because they could not afford the money. Another method was proposed to first use the nitrate loan from the cooperative, and the money for nine cattle and one donkey was raised in three days. Dong Lanzhang, the director of the Farmers' Association, first connected seven households that had leached nitrate after returning to the village from training to form a group and implement nitrate leaching. They also took out a loan to buy an ox and a donkey and concentrated on plowing the land. Dong Lantian in the group specialized in plowing the land, and participated in scraping saline soil for two short afternoons in the morning and afternoon, while others leached nitrate. Men and women helped each other, and a work-point method was adopted. Sewing a cloth shirt was worth two work points, and grain was used to repay the work points in the autumn harvest. Dong Lanzhang himself did not have enough time to work because of his work, so the group calculated his work points according to how much work he did. Now all the autumn land has been plowed and 350 jin of nitrate has been leached, worth 140,000 yuan. Dong Tongjiang, the deputy director of the Farmers' Association, joined the Dong Yinke Mutual Aid Group. This group had land but no cattle. When it was first organized, it was an empty shell. Since the proposal to pool money to buy livestock and save manpower to engage in sideline businesses, they pooled some money and loans together to buy a donkey and plowed the land with the help of other groups. Dong Tongjiang also led the organization of a bean sprout workshop, dividing labor to manage agricultural and sideline production. Two people fed livestock and cultivated land, two people ran the bean sprout workshop, and one person贩布to Shanxi. The group's production was very energetic. The bean sprout workshop alone can sell two jars of bean sprouts every day, earning back five sheng of beans.

　　干部带头想出办法北坊群众担水种棉
    【本报黎城讯】北坊干部于五月三日讨论担水种棉，大家一致认为：天越等越高，节日越等越迟，不能等雨，要赶紧下种。并讨论出用圊水栽的办法，一担圊三担水，这样地松苗易活，埋窝时要比地面高一些，圪堆不怕晒干，秧出时再用耢耢一遍。棉籽或用冷水浸出芽或用热水闷出芽栽到地里快出也省水。经深刻研究讨论后，深入群众动员，在干部积极分子带头下，从四日组织全村所有畜力耕地，五日开始栽种至九日五天中，全村栽棉一百四十亩。连金堂组原计划种八亩，在金堂的推动下，共栽十亩二分，群众轻松愉快的说：“咱们要是光等雨，现在还是白瞪眼。”“要不是组织起来，那能这样来的快。”栽棉中并特别注意了吸收辅助劳力参加，发工票上整工一个作十分，老汉、儿童刨窝、下籽、倒水，大部顶八分或六分，当天评工发工票。现栽棉已结束，各组并经选栽棉英雄，干部、群众情绪很高，计划突击担水栽金皇后、栽土玉茭，用栽棉的劲头来完成栽玉茭。

    【本报平顺讯】一区山南底村，今春按户订的植棉计划，全村九十亩，在雨前仅下种五十亩，耽心出不来，五月一日下了二场雨，群众的情绪马上高起来了。村干部顺住这股劲，便召集互助组组长会议，按组动员多种棉，结果收效很大。突击下种中，动员了妇女、儿童都参加，全村在二、三两日内，不仅完成原计划九十亩，并超种七十亩。

    【本报冀南十四日电】鸡泽小寨生产运动是在村干部亲自串连组织与解决生产困难后开展起来的。全村的有耕牛十头、驴十二头，耕地二四八三亩秋地，很是作难。村中提出凑钱伙买牛的办法，但大多数组因凑不起钱发了愁。又提出先由合作社支硝款办法，三天内就凑了九头牛和一匹驴的款。农会主任董兰章受训回村首先串连淋过硝的七户组成一组，实行淋硝。又拿借款买了一头牛，一头驴，突击犁地。该组董兰田专门犁地，早起和午后两个小晌参加刮盐土，别人全部淋硝。男女互助，采用拨工办法，缝一件布衫顶两个工，秋收以粮还工。董兰章自己因工作没整工夫，组里就按他做活多少计工。现在秋地全部犁完，并淋硝三五零斤，值十四万元。农会副主任董同江参加了董银科互助组，该组有地没牛，初组织起来，是一付空架子。自提出伙买牲口，省出人力搞副业后，就凑了些钱和贷款合起来买了一头驴，与别的组互助翻完地。董同江又领导组织开豆芽坊，分工经营农副业生产，二人喂牲口种地，二人经营豆芽坊，一人往山西贩布，全组生产搞的非常带劲，单豆芽坊每天可卖两缸豆芽，可赚回豆子五升。
