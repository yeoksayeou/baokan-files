　　Northwest Democratic Allied Army's 38th Army Holds Meeting
    Commemorating the Anniversary of the 55th Division Uprising
    General Kong Congzhou Denounces Chiang Kai-shek for Eliminating "Non-嫡系" Troops
    [Special Dispatch] May 15th marked the first anniversary of the uprising of the 55th Division led by General Kong Congzhou. The 38th Army of the Northwest Democratic Allied Army held a special meeting and dinner to commemorate this glorious day. More than 60 representatives from organs and units attended, many of whom were personally involved in the uprising last year, recalling the past with righteous indignation.
    Tracing back to the glorious history of the unit's participation in the campaign against Yuan Shikai, the defense of Xi'an in 1926, and the Xi'an Incident in 1936, Army Commander Kong recounted the entire process of the War of Resistance Against Japan, in which Chiang Kai-shek attacked, undermined, divided, weakened, and even used armed secret agents to attack the unit in a series of events, pointing out that Chiang Kai-shek's vicious methods were forcing sacrifices without providing reinforcements. He said with even greater indignation: "During the War of Resistance, many 'non-嫡系' troops were destroyed by Chiang Kai-shek's rogue tactics. Why weren't we eliminated? Because under the leadership of Army Commander Zhao Shoushan, the 38th Army transformed its cadres, improved the political quality and combat effectiveness of the troops, fought bravely against Japanese imperialism, and also engaged in resolute and sharp struggles against Chiang Kai-shek's secret agent claws, consolidating itself. Therefore, Chiang Kai-shek used a 'luring the tiger from the mountain' scheme, transferring General Zhao Shoushan to the distant Liangzhou as commander-in-chief, 'promoting' General Sun Weiru to the Sixth War Area as commander; and finally, he came up with a 'moving the god while leaving the temple,' calling Li Xingzhong to fill the empty designation of the 41st Regiment, and even allowing his direct descendant Zhang Yaoming to completely annex the 96th Army!" He felt infinite emotion as he spoke. But when he talked about the uprising, he seemed rejuvenated: "Since the 'July 7th' uprising of the 17th Division in Luoning in 1945, my 55th Division and I became the target of Zhang Yaoming's attacks. Last March, Chiang convened a military conference in Nanjing, but he didn't call me to participate; in April, he transferred me to the position of deputy army commander, under strict surveillance. In early May, Chiang Kai-shek personally flew to Xi'an, Xinxiang, and Hankou to arrange the civil war. On the 12th, Zhang Yaoming took a night train to Zhengzhou, and on the 14th, he returned to Gongxian, and issued an order for the 55th Division to go to Xinxiang early the next morning to 'prepare for war,' but to leave the artillery behind. I judged that we were not to cross the Yellow River, but to be dealt with near Zhengzhou. Disregarding the unfavorable terrain and circumstances, we took emergency action before dawn on the 15th. The situation during the uprising was very tense, with the 27th Army, the 90th Army, and the troops sent by Zhang Yaoming attacking from all sides, fighting fiercely. ... As a result, Chiang Kai-shek did not eliminate us, but instead we took a step forward; the 38th Army was reborn, and the people had one more force." He called on all army cadres: "The most important thing is to unify our thinking, in order to defeat the people's enemy Chiang Kai-shek and the Northwest people's mortal enemy Hu Zongnan, unite, progress, prepare strength, learn command and combat techniques, practice production and economy, and work hard!" Finally, he expressed deep gratitude for the care and help received from the people of the liberated areas and all parties over the past year; he felt infinitely bright about the victory of the people's revolution and the future of his troops!

　　西北民主联军三十八军集会
    纪念五五师起义周年   
    孔从周将军痛斥蒋介石消灭“杂牌”
    【本报特讯】五月十五日为孔从周将军率五五师起义一周年，西北民主联军第三十八军特集会聚餐，纪念这个光荣的日子。到会机关部队代表六十多人，很多是去年起义的亲身参加者，他们回忆往事，满怀义愤。
    回溯该部参加讨袁护法、民十五年坚守西安及二十五年双十二事变等光荣历史后，孔军长历陈抗战的整个过程中，蒋介石打击、破坏、分化、削弱，甚至用武装特务袭击该部的一连串的事实，指出蒋介石的毒辣手段，是在迫使牺牲，不予补充。他更激愤地说：“在抗战中许多‘杂牌’被毁灭在蒋介石的这种流氓手段之下，我们为什么没有被消灭呢？因为三十八军在赵寿山军长领导之下，改造干部，提高了部队的政治素质和战斗力，和日本帝国主义奋勇作战，也和蒋介石的特务爪牙进行了坚决的尖锐的斗争，巩固了自己。因此，蒋介石用‘调虎离山’之计，把赵寿山将军调到辽远的凉州当总司令，把孙蔚如将军‘升’到第六战区当司令长官；最后来了一个‘搬神留庙’，叫李兴中顶了四一团的空番号，连九十六军也叫他的嫡系张耀明全部并吞！”他谈到这里无限感慨。但一谈到起义，便又显得神来焕发了：“自三十四年‘七一七’十七师在洛宁起义后，我和五五师便成为张耀明的打击目标。去年三月，蒋在南京召开军事会议，独不叫我参加；到四月把我调为副军长，监视极严，到五月初，蒋介石亲飞西安新乡、汉口布置内战，十二日张耀明夜车到郑州，十四日回巩县，就下命令叫五五师第二天一早开往新乡‘备战’，但要把炮留下。我判明不得过黄河，是要在郑州附近解决我们。便不顾地形和处境的恶劣，在十五日天未明紧急行动起来。起义时的情况，是十分紧张的，二十七军、九十军和张耀明派的部队，从各方面围攻上来，打得很剧烈。……结果，蒋介石没有消灭我们，反遇着我们前进了一步；三十八军是新生了，人民多了一支力量。”他号召全军干部：“最要紧的是打通思想，为了打败人民公敌蒋介石和西北人民死敌胡宗南，团结、进步、准备力量，学好指挥与战斗技术，生产节约，艰苦奋斗！”最后，他对一年来受到解放区人民和各方面的爱护帮助，深表感谢；对于人民革命胜利及其部队前途感觉无限光明！
