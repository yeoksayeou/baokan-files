　　Matters as Important as Winning Battles
    Currently, the military and civilians in all liberated areas are fighting the enemy. Everyone already understands that winning battles is an important matter. However, war is protracted, and without food, battles cannot be fought. If everyone is not mobilized to overcome all the difficulties of wartime and carry out spring plowing, serious difficulties will arise in the food supply. Spring plowing is as important as winning battles. The Northwest Bureau's instructions regarding spring plowing should not only be carefully implemented by the party, government, military, and civilians in the Northwest, but also deserve serious attention from all liberated areas, both front and rear. They should be adapted to local conditions and implemented according to these principles. This year's spring plowing is the first since the outbreak of the full-scale war; therefore, this spring plowing is of particularly significant importance for maintaining victory in the long-term war. Experience must be gained from this spring plowing so that we have confidence and methods in future production work.
    This full-scale civil war launched by Chiang Kai-shek under the instigation and with the help of American imperialists, its scale and intensity, exceeds even the Japanese imperialists' war of aggression. Chiang's troops occupy many places in the liberated areas, devastating the people's productive forces to an extreme degree, no different from the "Three Alls Policy" implemented by the Japanese imperialist bandits in the late stages of the war of aggression. On the liberated area side, due to the huge scale of the war, the mobilization of manpower is also very large; due to the frequent changes in the front lines, the people suffer from the devastation of Chiang's troops, are displaced and unsettled, and therefore have no heart for production. At this time, the leadership of spring plowing is particularly important; the Northwest Bureau's emphasis on the leadership issue in its instructions is very correct. Leading organs of the Party, government, military and civilians at all levels in the liberated areas must personally carry out this spring plowing. Strive to seize the time to rush plowing and planting, even planting a little is better than not planting at all, planting a little more is better than planting a little less, and bureaucracy must be overthrown. This is the most important thing.
    The Northwest Bureau's instructions also put forward methods such as developing guerrilla warfare to protect spring plowing, economizing on the use of civilian labor, and organizing labor mutual aid. On these issues, there are many good examples in various liberated areas; however, they have not been fully implemented. Some places are doing very poorly. Either guerrilla warfare is not linked to spring plowing; or the use of civilian labor is not economical, resulting in extreme waste; or labor mutual aid exists in peacetime but disappears during wartime. These shortcomings must be taken seriously and ways must be found to correct them.
    Another important link is that organs, schools, and troops help the people with farming. The Northwest Bureau's instructions stated: "People who serve on the front lines, such as stretcher teams, can also use their spare time to help the masses in the war zone with production." They also stated: "Persisting in this year's self-sufficiency production is more important than in any previous year." Organs, schools, and troops helping the people with production has many benefits: the unity of the military and civilians, the improvement of discipline, the increase in production, and the education of labor are all these benefits. Not only should the rear areas do this, but the front-line troops must set aside manpower and animal power to help the people with farming whenever they are stationed for a week. First of all, help the families of soldiers and poor farmers, as well as the people who serve on the front lines. Helping the people in the areas they are stationed in with farming is a method that has been put forward for the first time in these instructions. If it is effectively implemented, it will increase a lot of labor and strengthen the education of mutual aid among the people.
    In short, this year's spring plowing is a major event, of extremely important significance for winning the victory in the patriotic self-defense war. In addition to striving to win battles and carrying out land reform, everyone should work together to do a good job in spring plowing. Only then will victory be greatly guaranteed.

### 同打胜仗一样要紧的事情

　　同打胜仗一样要紧的事情
    现在全国各解放区军民都在打敌人；打胜仗是一件重要的事情，这一点大家早已了解。但战争是长期的，没有粮食就打不了仗，不能大家动员起来，克服战时的一切困难进行春耕，粮食问题就会发生重大的困难。春耕，这是与打胜仗一样重要的事情。西北局所发出的关于春耕的指示，不仅西北的党政军民要大家注意执行，全国各解放区不论前方后方都值得引起严重的注意，照此原则因地制宜，把它实现起来。今年的春耕是全面战争爆发以后的第一次春耕；因而这次春耕对于坚持长期战争的胜利意义特别重大。必须从此次春耕中取得经验，然后在今后的生产工作中才有信心，才有办法。
    此次蒋介石在美国帝国主义者指使和帮助之下发动的全面内战，战争的规模与激烈程度，比日本帝国主义的侵略战争有过之无不及。蒋军占领了解放区许多地方，对人民的生产力的摧残，惨酷达于极点，与日本帝国主义强盗在侵略战争末期所执行的“三光政策”没有差别。在解放区方面，由于战争规模巨大，人力的动员也非常之大；由于战线时常变动，人民遭受蒋军摧残，流离不定，也就无心生产。这时候，春耕的领导就特别重要；西北局指示中首先强调领导问题是很正确的。解放区各级党政军民领导机关，要亲自动手来进行这个春耕。争取时间抢耕、抢种，那怕种上一点点也比不种好，多种一点点也比少种一点点好，官僚主义必须打倒。这是第一重要的事情。
    西北局指示中又提出了以发展游击战争来保卫春耕、十分节用民力、组织劳动互助等办法。在这些问题上，各解放区有许多很好的例子；但是并未完全做好。有些地方做得很差。或则游击战争与春耕没有联系搞起来；或则使用民力方面不知节用，发生极大的浪费；或则平时有劳动互助，战时反而没有了。要重视这些缺点，并设法把它改正。
    另一重要的环子是机关学校部队帮助人民耕种。西北局指示中提出了：“到前线服务的人民如担架队等，亦可利用空间，帮助战区群众生产。”提出了：“坚持今年的自给生产，比以往任何一年都要重要。”机关学校部队帮助人民生产，好处非常之多：军民的团结，纪律的改善，生产的增加，劳动的教育，就是这些好处。不但后方应该这样做，前方部队凡驻军有一星期时间，必须抽出人力和畜力来助民耕种。首先帮助军人家属和贫苦农民，到前线服务的人民。帮助所到地区人民进行耕种，是这次指示中第一次提出来的办法，如果切实执行，就可增加很多劳动力，和加强人民中互助的教育。
    总之，今年的春耕是一件大事情，对争取爱国自卫战争的胜利有极其重大的意义。除了争取打胜仗和进行土地改革之外，全体一致尽力来把春耕做好。胜利才有很大保证。
