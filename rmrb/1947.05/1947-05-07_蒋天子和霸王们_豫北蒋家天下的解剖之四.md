　　Jiang the Emperor and the Warlords
　　An Anatomy of the Jiang Family's Rule in Northern Henan, Part Four
　　Li Pu
　　If Jiang Jieshi is likened to a tree, the local despots are his roots and root hairs. On the one hand, they maintain the tree's center of gravity, preventing it from toppling, and on the other hand, they absorb nutrients for him, preventing it from withering and dying. This concept became clear in my mind because of the following facts.
　　Pang Village, northwest of the Junxian Station on the Pinghan Railway, is one of the lairs of the local tyrant Hu Quanlu. Therefore, the "government orders" of Jiang Jieshi's government can be fully communicated, and Pang Village Township bears a heavier burden of grain and money for the Jiang government than other townships. In June last year, Li Dangui, the head of Pang Village Township, submitted a petition to the Jiang-controlled Junxian County government, stating: "This township is adjacent to Shentun Township, but the apportionments are unequal. The special commissioner's office in this township apportions three chi of white cloth per tael of silver per person, and the unified collection and expenditure apportions 35 jin and 8 liang of grain per tael of silver per person, with expenses of 1,060 yuan. However, Shentun Township apportions 1.8 chi of white cloth per tael of silver per person, and the unified collection and expenditure apportions 21 jin, 11 liang, and 5 qian of food grain, with expenses of 650 yuan and 5 mao. The numbers for the two townships are vastly different. The rest can be inferred."
　　The county government issued Instruction No. 381 in the Civil Affairs section, ordering Shentun Township to investigate and reply. The head of Shentun Township submitted a petition, answering:
　　"Upon investigation, this township originally apportioned the silver quota of over 700 taels among several villages including Xinzhuang, Yigou, and Shentun. However, in order to expand the territory and implement government orders, we occasionally tried to apportion to villages in the Gaomiao and Jiaozhuang areas. However, these villages are all occupied by treacherous bandits, who come and go from time to time. When the bandits leave, we force them to hand over the payments; when the bandits come, they do not hand them over. (Reporter's note: The so-called 'hand over' probably means to take control.) Moreover, when personnel are sent to urge the payment of grain and money, some have been captured by the bandits..."
　　After seeing these documents, the reporter paid attention to finding materials to see how much grain and money the Jiang family government actually obtained from Pang Village Township, whether it was more or less than what Hu Quanlu himself obtained. This means, to see what "government orders" Jiang Jieshi "implemented" in Pang Village besides Hu Quanlu's "government orders."
　　Rulers have always only asked the common people for grain and money, and never give receipts. The items are numerous and the demands are relentless, so the common people themselves cannot possibly keep a detailed account. Fortunately, I found some documents similar to the above, and discovered that what Jiang the Emperor wanted was actually more than what the local despots themselves wanted.
　　From January to June of the thirty-fifth year, the Junxian County government demanded 26,232,829 yuan from Pang Village Township for the item of expenses. (See Junxian County Government Instructions Finance Needs Nos. 183 and 286) In the same period, from January to June of the thirty-fifth year, the various security teams of the Third Special District only demanded 951,497 yuan from Pang Village Township for the item of expenses. (See County Government Civil Affairs Instruction No. 185) At that time, Hu Quanlu was the 4th Security Regiment and Cheng Daosheng was the 1st Regiment. They were not changed to the 4th and 1st Regiments in the "People's Self-Defense Training Corps" until September. That is to say, the expenses demanded from this township by a Jiang-controlled county government were more than 26 times the expenses demanded by several local despots combined.
　　Of course, the local despots took away an astonishing amount of grain, but what the county government demanded was not un-astonishing. According to the incomplete materials I obtained, they demanded more than 214,000 jin from Pang Village Township in half a year (see Finance Needs Instructions Nos. 32, 124, and 183). In addition, the 16th Army Station Sub-supervisory Department demanded military grain on its behalf, and Pang Village Township shared more than 120,000 jin (see Finance Needs Instruction No. 260).
　　And in addition, there are many "government orders," including the expenses of the local cadre training class, the training fees for indefinite trainees, the training fees for the deputy head of the county security regiment, the clothing fees for the regiment police and public service personnel, the supplies and travel expenses for the transportation general station, the construction fees for the Third Special District Public Hospital, and the Third Special Commissioner's Office also demanded that counties, townships, and towns share the expenses and public grain for some North Strong Communications Agency. In addition, the bricks, lime, and wooden boards for building fortifications for the garrison troops and blockhouses along the railway line are endless. Some are orders conveyed by the county government, and some are letters from any company or platoon demanding this and that, from grain carts to shoes and bricks, all are in demand. There was even a public letter from some regiment saying: "Our regiment is stationed here to suppress bandits, and our功 (gōng) merits lie with the Party and the country. Now that the club must be established, please have your township prepare some tables, chairs, and benches, without delay," and so on.
　　None of the big package of documents I obtained was not related to the apportionment of "grain and money," alas, this is Jiang the Emperor's "government order!" These local despots, compared to Jiang the Emperor, are truly a small witch seeing a great witch, merely small thieves stealing hooks, where can there be the audacity of the great national thief Jiang Jieshi who is always insatiable and so shameless to the extreme!
　　In the civil war military, Jiang Jieshi relied on the local despots even more. In addition to replenishing soldiers in their "fiefdoms," the main thing was the strategic significance.
　　At the beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Jiang Jieshi recruited them in order to have them oppose the Communists. In order to avoid causing a misunderstanding with Okamura Neiji, Jiang Jieshi told him to be "highly mobile." That is to say, it would not hurt to collude with Okamura Neiji. But the Japanese wanted to strive for political influence, to be clear, so they formally surrendered. Jiang Jieshi and Okamura Neiji's purposes were originally the same, that is, to oppose the Communists and the Chinese people, so they gave them numbers at the same time, and gave them assistance at the same time. During the military mediation period last year, there were many disputes over them. Everyone already knows, there is no need to say more.
　　Why did Jiang Jieshi value them so much? Originally, Jiang Jieshi himself knew that his troop strength was not enough to achieve area occupation, so he must rely on these local snakes. In the entire northern Henan area, there are more than a dozen such local snakes. The section from the Yellow River estuary to Anyang is the base for opening up the Pinghan Railway, and Jiang Jieshi relied on these local despots to extend to both sides of the railway. Between Anyang and Linzhang there is Guo Qing, northeast of Anyang there is Wang Ziquan, east of Anyang city there is Cheng Daosheng, in Tangyin there is Si Huasheng, west of Junxian city there is Hu Quanlu, between Pu and Hua there is He Guansan, north of Yanjin there is Wang Sanzhu, and on the Daoqing line there are Li Ying and Liu Yueting. In Anyang city there are the remnants of Pang Bingxun's troops, and Sun Dianying was allowed to hold Tangyin city. Pang and Sun are the largest among the feudal lords. For Jiang the Emperor, they are like the branching roots of a tree, the claws and teeth of a wild beast.
　　Those who steal hooks are not punished, in order to facilitate the rampant abuse of those who steal the country, this is the inseparable relationship between Jiang the Emperor and the feudal lords.

　　蒋天子和霸王们
    豫北蒋家天下的解剖之四
    李普
    如果把蒋介石比做一株树，各地的土霸王便是他的根和根须。一方面维持这株树的重心，使他不致于倾倒，一方面为他吸收养料，使他不致于枯萎而死去。在我的思想中使这个观念明确起来的，乃是下述的实事。
    平汉路浚县车站西北的庞村，是土霸王扈全禄的巢穴之一。因此蒋介石政府的“政令”便能全部通达，庞村乡对蒋政府粮款的负担就比别的乡更苛重。去年六月间，庞村乡乡长李丹桂上了一个呈文给蒋记浚县县政府，说：“本乡与申屯乡壤毗连，而摊派不平。本乡摊派专员公署每两丁银白布三尺，摊派统收统支每两丁银合粮三十五斤八两，经费一千零六十元。而申屯乡摊派专署每两丁银白布一尺八寸，摊派统收统支食粮二十一斤十一两五钱，经费六百五十元零五毛。两乡之数，大相径庭。其余可以类推。”
    县政府在民字第三八一号训令内叫申屯乡查明具复。申屯乡乡长上了一个呈文，答道：
    “查本乡原以新庄宜沟申屯数村七百余两之银数摊派。但为开拓地面，推行政令起见，偶向高庙焦庄一带村庄试派。然该数村均为奸匪所占，时来时去。匪去强催则掌，匪来则不掌。记者按：所谓‘掌’，大概是掌握之意。）况派丁前往催缴粮款等物，曾有被匪捉去者……。”
    看到这些文件之后，记者就注意寻找材料，看蒋家政府究竟从庞村乡，得到了多少粮款等物，比扈全禄自己得到的多呢还是少。这意思就是说，看庞村除了扈全禄的“政令”之外，蒋介石还“推行”了一些什么“政令”。
    从来统治者只向老百姓要粮款等物，而永远不给收据。名目繁多而又苛索无虚日，老百姓自己更不可能详细记一笔流水账。幸而我多少找到了几张类似上述的文件，发现蒋天子所要的，竟比土霸们自己要的还要多。
    三十五年一月到六月，浚县县政府的经费一项，向庞村乡要了二千六百二十三万二千八百二十九元。（见浚县县政府训令财需字第一八三，二八六号）同是三十五年一月至六月，第三专区各保安团队的经费一项向庞村乡要的却只有九十五万一千四百九十七元。（见县府民字第一八五号训令）那时扈全禄是保安第四团，程道生是第一团，他们到九月间才改为“民众自卫集训总队”内的第四团和第一团。就是说，一个蒋记县政府向这个乡要的经费，比几个土霸王合起来要的经费，多二十六倍有余。
    当然，土霸王们要去了数量极为惊人的粮食，可是县政府要的并不是不惊人的，据我所得到的不完全的材料，他们在半年内向庞村乡要了二十一万四千多斤（见财需字第三二，第一二四，第一八三号训令）而此外，还有代十六兵站分监部要的军粮，庞村乡分担了十二万多斤（见财需字训令二六○号）。
    而此外，“政令”还多着哩，有所谓地方干部训练班的经费，无期受训人员的训练费，县保安团副团长的训练费，团警公役的服装费，交通总站的给养和旅费，第三专区公立医院建筑费，第三专署又为一个什么北强通讯社要各县乡镇分担经费和公粮，还有修筑驻军工事和铁路沿线碉堡的砖块石灰木板等，更是无穷无尽。有的是由县政府传达命令，有的是随便一个连一个排都可以来一封信要这要那，从粮食大车到鞋子砖块，都在需索之列。甚至有一个什么团来一封公函说：“本团驻此剿匪，功在党国，兹以俱乐部即须成立，请贵乡代筹桌椅板凳若干，不得延误”云云。
    我所得到的一大包文件，没有一张不是有关摊派“粮款等物”的，呜呼，这就是蒋天子的“政令！”这些土霸王，比起蒋天子来，真是小巫之见大巫，只是小小的窃钩者而已，那里有窃国大盗蒋介石那样永远吃不饱的气慨，那样无耻到了极点的手段！
    在内战军事上，蒋介石所倚赖于土霸们者就更大了。除了在他们的“采邑”里补充兵员之外，主要的是在战略意义上。
    抗战初期蒋介石之所以收编他们，是为了叫他们反共。为了避免引起冈村宁次的误会，蒋介石叫他“高度机动”。就是说不妨和冈村宁次勾结。但是日本人要争取政治影响，要明朗化，他们就正式投降了，蒋介石和冈村宁次的目的本来一样，就是反共反中国人民，于是他们就同时给他们以番号，同时给他们以接济。去年军事调处时期，曾为他们发生过不少的争论。大家都已知道，用不着多说了。
    为什么蒋介石这样重视他们呢？原来蒋介石自己也知道兵力不够，不能达成面的占领，因此一定要依靠这些地头蛇。整个豫北地区，这样的地头蛇有十几个之多。黄河口到安阳一段，是打通平汉路的基地，蒋介石就是靠这些土霸王向铁路两侧伸展。在安阳临漳间有郭清，安阳东北有王自全，安阳城东有程道生，汤阴有司华生，浚县城西有扈全禄，濮滑之间有何冠三，延津以北有王三祝，道清线上有李英和刘月亭。安阳城有庞炳勋的残部，孙殿英则给他据守汤阴城，庞孙两个是诸侯之中最大的。对于蒋天子，他们就像一株树的分根，一匹野兽的爪牙。
    窃钩者不诛，乃是为了便于窃国者的肆虐，这就是蒋天子和诸侯们血肉不可分的关系。
