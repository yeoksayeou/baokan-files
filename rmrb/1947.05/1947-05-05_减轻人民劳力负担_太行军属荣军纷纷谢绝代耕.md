　　Easing the Labor Burden on the People

    Taihang Military Dependents and Veterans Decline Substitute Farming
    [This newspaper comprehensive report] Military dependents and honored veterans in various counties of Taihang are saving civilian labor by declining substitute farming. In Wangkan Village, Changzhi, fifteen military dependents' households declined substitute farming, and four people, including Zhao Zhongxin, volunteered to help others. In Yehe Village, Wu'an, seventeen military dependents' households declined substitute farming. Gao Guile, with two children, even volunteered to farm four mu of land himself, leaving ten mu to be farmed by others. Some military dependents' households with labor even requested to farm land for others. Except for four households where both male and female labor was completely available, needing no help from the masses to carry water or do chores, all other households automatically cancelled water carrying and chores, saving the masses eighteen workdays per day for water carrying alone. Ma Chunying, an old lady from Hengshui Village, Lingchuan, is sixty-one years old. Her grandson, Liu Baozhong, joined the army. After being emancipated and allocated land this year, she goes to the fields early and returns late every day, participating in mutual aid teams and not allowing others to farm for her. She said, "I have been emancipated, and I am happy to work." Comrade Wang Wansheng, a retired veteran from Miaojiao, Huguan, actively participates in production. In the first month of the year, when others had not delivered manure, he carried it to the fields himself, half a load at a time, finishing before the masses even started. During the spring plowing, he joined the labor exchange team and, in addition to farming his own land, also helped military dependents and families of those participating in the war to farm their land. In the fourth district of Xiyang, a disabled veteran from Changling, who lost an arm, resolutely refused help from the village. He joined a mutual aid team, carrying manure every day, while his wife spun cotton and his sixteen-year-old daughter did chores. The whole family is producing with great energy.
