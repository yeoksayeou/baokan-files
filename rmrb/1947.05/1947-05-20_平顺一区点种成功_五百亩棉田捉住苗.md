　　In order to implement the production policy of generally achieving "cultivate three, surplus one," Ping Shun's First District is vigorously promoting special crops, and has put forward action slogans such as "If you want to prosper, grow more cotton." The district originally planned to plant 2,700 mu of cotton, but the area sown has now exceeded the original plan by more than 280 mu. They began to pay attention to ideological mobilization. In areas such as Beihe Village, where cotton harvests were good last year, they calculated the benefits of planting cotton, explaining that the profits were high. For example, in排行, it was calculated that Guo Fude's three mu of cotton land last year was equivalent to nine mu of autumn land, dispelling the masses' reluctance to plant more. In Southwest River, the reasons for not harvesting well last year were studied. The conclusion was that they lacked experience last year and planted too early and too deep, dispelling the masses' doubts about harvesting cotton. Many methods were also proposed for organizing the masses, such as organizing water carrying for planting. For example,排行 carried water to plant 350 mu of cotton in two days. Wang Zhuang implemented a "borrow a furrow to plant cotton" method. Villages such as Shannan Di adjusted cotton fields and established cotton planting cooperatives, solving the difficulty of masses wanting to plant but lacking land. Secondly, they seized the opportunity after rain to launch a surprise planting campaign. In just two days, eight villages including Shang Wu Liu planted 1,900 mu of cotton. According to statistics, the cotton seedlings that have been watered and planted on 502.8 mu have emerged from the soil. The masses are very happy to see the emerging cotton seedlings. For example, Guo Fude of排行 said: "The cotton has all sprouted. This year, we are confident in achieving 'cultivate three, surplus one'." Wang Si then said: "When the cadres started mobilizing, I always thought it was useless to carry water because of the drought. But today, seeing the small seedlings growing so well, I feel very happy. It's really right to listen to the government." Wang Qu in the Fourth District conducted education on getting rich, breaking the ideas of waiting for rain, drought, and planting less cotton; and researched three methods for planting cotton in dry weather: plow the wet land several times more, and it can come out after planting. Organize all labor to carry water to plant cotton in fields that lack water. Soak the cotton seeds in more water, take them out and rub them with ash, and dry them in the sunlight to sprout quickly. After the discussion, the masses were very happy. According to statistics, the whole village has planted 430 mu of cotton in three days, and plans to plant all 700 mu of repaired cotton land in the next four days. After mobilizing to plant cotton on the night of the 4th of this month, Nanzhuang in the Third District spent three days from the 5th to the 7th with the whole village carrying water to plant 38 mu of cotton. Together with the previously planted 89 mu, the whole village's cotton planting has exceeded the plan (the original plan was to plant 117 mu).

　　平顺一区点种成功
    五百亩棉田捉住苗
    【本报讯】平顺一区为了贯彻普遍达到耕三余一的生产方针，大量推广特种作物，并提出“要想发家多种棉花”等行动口号，全区原计划种棉二千七百亩，现在下种的已超过原计划二百八十余亩。他们开始注意了思想动员，北河等村去年收棉好的地区算种棉的账，说明利大，如排行算了郭伏德去年种棉三亩顶种九亩秋地，打通群众不多种思想。西南河就研究去年没收好的原因是去年没经验，种的太早太深了，打通了群众不收棉花的说法。在组织群众方面也提出许多办法，组织担水栽花。如排行二天担水栽花三百五十亩，王庄实行了借垧栽花办法，山南底等村调剂棉花地，成立了植棉合作社，解决了群众想种没地的困难。其次，抓紧雨后突击下种，仅上五六等八个村两天种花一千九百亩。现在统计，担水栽的花已有五百零二亩八分出土，群众看着出土的棉苗，都非常高兴，如排行郭伏德说：“棉花都捉住苗啦，今年耕三余一可有把握啦。”王四则说：“干部开始动员，我老是想天旱出不来，担水是白费力气，今天看着小苗长得很俊，我觉的很痛快，真是听上政府话没错。”四区王曲进行发家教育，打破了等雨天旱少种棉花等思想；并研究出旱天种棉三种办法：湿地多耙几遍，种上可以出来。没垧地组织所有劳力担水栽花。棉籽多用水泡，捞出来用灰搓，在太阳光下晒快发芽。讨论后群众很高兴，统计全村在三天内已栽种棉花四百三十亩，计划再有四天将修理好的七百亩花地全部下种。三区南庄于本月四日夜动员栽花后，五号到七号三天时间全村担水栽花三十八亩，连前种的八十九亩全村种花已超过计划（原计划种一百一十七亩）。
