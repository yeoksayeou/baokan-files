Old Hero Ye Wenzhang
Organizes Mutual Aid to Survive Famine Years
    Shao Zhen
    The title of "Old Hero" has been around for more than two years – it's unclear exactly who gave him the title, but everyone, young and old, male and female, within a radius of three to five miles in neighboring villages, frequently calls him that with affection.
    The old hero's real name is Ye Wenzhang, and he is from Wu Guanying in the first district of Jize. He is sixty-three years old this year. He came from a poor family and worked as a hired farmhand from the age of twenty-two to forty-seven. He is a simple farmer, not very tall, with a purplish-red face and sparse, short whiskers. Although he is getting on in years, he doesn't consider himself old. He often says, "Who says I'm old? When it comes to working in the fields, the young people can't keep up with me!" He also says, "I worked as a hired hand my whole life, and in my old age, I ended up with nothing to show for it (saving and scrimping with no surplus). Now, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we've completely turned ourselves around, and I feel like I'm reborn, full of energy!"
    Indeed, although the old hero is sixty-three years old, his personal labor skills, farming techniques, and diligent habits are unmatched by most people. As County Magistrate Han said, "The old hero is truly skilled at farming. He's worth two ordinary people with a hoe. He's really good and fast." When he hoes the ground, the hoe seems to fly past, the weeds are chopped so clean, and the seedlings are left so evenly spaced. Plowing the land makes a straight line. He truly deserves to be a heroic model.
    He is very diligent in going to the fields every day and has never missed a work session in the mutual aid group. Even when our cadres visit, he always chooses a gap in the work to talk about business, never wasting a whole session or a whole day staying at home to chat.
    Not only are his personal labor skills good, but his leadership in mutual aid is also very good. The mutual aid group he leads has never collapsed in four years. For several years, Wu Guanying has consistently enjoyed the honor of being a model village for production mutual aid.
  　I. Mutual Aid Production to Survive Famine Years
    His mutual aid group was organized in the spring of the 33rd year of the Republic of China (1944), when the famine was extremely severe. At that time, there were many enemy blockhouses near the village, and the environment was very harsh. He had been a hired laborer for landlords his entire life, and when he returned home in his old age, he had earned nothing. When the famine came, many people starved to death in this area. He described the situation at that time as follows: "That year, my son Erbao sold rice to make ends meet for the time being. My neighbor, Ye Dala, was a carpenter who had sold all his furniture and was about to starve to death. He had dug his own grave and asked the old hero several times to bury him. At that time, the old hero gave him some thin vegetable soup to drink and advised him not to die, but everyone had no good way to save themselves. 'People who shouldn't die will eventually be saved.' Our anti-Japanese District Chief Ma came, and later County Magistrate Han also came. They wanted us to organize mutual aid for production and also provided loans for grain and seeds. At that time, I didn't know what mutual aid was, I just thought it was a public matter of the Eighth Route Army, and if the enemy found out, it would be terrible! But the district chief and county magistrate repeatedly said that mutual aid production could save ourselves and prevent us from dying. My mind became a little active, and I went to discuss it with others, but they all said that the enemy was so close, wasn't that just a joke! It made me unable to make up my mind, but my family was still starving, and if I didn't think of a way, I would die anyway. At that time, I explained to people while connecting with eleven families. Zhou San only worked for three or four days and then didn't dare to continue. I said to others: If the enemy comes, we'll run, and when the enemy leaves, we'll produce, what are we afraid of? But Ye Dala was still lying down waiting to die. I got anxious and said, 'At this point, are you still afraid of death?' In the end, we managed to consolidate ten families. The next day, we went to the fields to pull the rake, and the government really gave us grain, one catty of grain per person per day (Ye Dala received one and a half catties because he was weakened by hunger). The first time we received more than three hundred catties of grain, and later we received more than seventy catties. This encouraged everyone to continue working."
    "We had only been working collectively in the fields for two days when Xu Sanwei from our village saw us and asked me what we were doing. I told him about the county magistrate and district chief lending us grain and seeds and asking us to engage in mutual aid production to save ourselves. That day, he connected with Yan Jizhen, Yan Zhengshui, and five other families, and they also received grain for mutual aid production. Later, the county magistrate and district chief also joined our group and were very energetic in pulling the plow and rake. At this time, it had spread throughout the village, and everyone was clamoring for mutual aid production. In a few days, eighteen groups were formed."
　  II. Leading the Fight Against Locusts and Developing Mutual Aid
    The emotions of the masses were like newly grown seedlings, and everyone held great hope. Unexpectedly, just after the first hoeing of the seedlings, the locusts came. District Chief Ma led the masses to fight locusts during the day and cut wheat at night. At this time, the whole village was organized, and men, women, and children all came out to deliver water and food. The division of labor for fighting locusts was clear. The masses felt the benefits of mutual aid and said that mutual aid was really good. At this time, County Magistrate Han and District Chief Ma, because the old hero was old, let him lead more than 300 women, while the district chief led 600-700 men. In a few days, the locusts were wiped out, but the seedlings were also eaten up. Everyone was worried, but it happened to rain heavily, so they continued the locust-fighting group without disbanding, took out a second loan for seeds, and replanted. The masses all saw with their own eyes that mutual aid meant great strength and many benefits. After the wheat was threshed, six more mutual aid groups were added, bringing the total to twenty-four groups. At this time, everyone had food to eat and continued mutual aid production until the autumn harvest. Everyone generally got three or four dou of harvest. Each household received a portion of the grain, and everyone happily said, "If it weren't for the old hero taking the lead in mutual aid production, we wouldn't be alive now."

　　老英雄叶文章
  　组织互助渡荒年
    少真
    “老英雄”的称号已经二年多了——究竟是谁给他送的称号，说不清，但是方圆三五里内的邻村，不论男女老少，都以亲切的口吻，经常的这样称呼他。
    老英雄真名叶文章，是鸡泽一区吴官营人，今年六十三岁，从小家穷，二十二岁到四十七岁，一直给人家当长工，是一个质朴的农民，个子不大，紫红色的面孔，稀稀的有些短胡，虽说他已经上了年纪，但他自认不老，他常说：“谁说我老呢？论下地，年轻人还碰不着我呢？”还说：“我拉了一辈子长工，临老落了个圆碰圆（省吃俭用不余积），这时共产党毛主席领导咱翻透身，我自觉像新生一样，有劲儿呢！”
    的确，老英雄虽说六十三岁了，他个人的劳动条件，耕作技术殷勤习惯，是一般人赶不上的，正如韩县长说：“老英雄种地真是把式，他一张锄下了地，一个顶俩，真是又好又快”，他锄起地来，一张锄像飞的一样过去后，草折那么干净，苗留的那么均匀，犁耕地是一条线直，真不愧为英雄模范。
    他每天很殷勤下地，互助组里一晌没缺过工。就是咱们的干部去了，他一定是择空隙谈工作，从不整时整晌的误着工陪人在家说闲话。
    他不但个人劳动条件好，领导互助也很好，他领导的互助组，四年没垮过，几年来，吴官营也一直享受着生产互助模范村的荣誉。
  　一、互助生产渡荒年
    他的互助组，是在民国三十三年春灾荒极严重时组织起来的，当时村附近敌人碉堡正多，环境很恶劣，他给地主当了一辈子雇工，临老回家啥也没赚下。灾荒来了，这一带村饿死人很不少，他谈起当时的情形是这样的：那年他儿子二保贩卖米，暂时顾嘴，邻家叶打拉，是个木匠，一切家具都卖光了，将要饿死，自己挖好坑，几次要老英雄将他埋了，当时老英雄一面给他些稀菜汤喝，一面劝他不要死，但是大家又没什么好办法自救。“人不该死终有救，我们的抗日马区长来了，后来韩县长也来了，他要我们组织起来互助生产，还给贷粮贷种，当时我还不知道互助是啥，只是想八路的公事，要敌人知道了，还了得？但是区长县长一再的说，互助生产能自救，可以不死。我心眼有点活了，去找别人商量，都说敌人这样近，那不是胡闹剧吗！弄的我拿不定主意，但是家里还饿着，不想办法反正是死，这时我便一面解释，一面串连了十一家，周三只干了三、四天就不敢干了；我给别人说：敌人来了，咱就跑跑，敌人走了，咱就生产，怕啥呢？但是叶打拉还是躺着等死，我着了急说：“事到如今，还怕死吗？结果算是巩固了十家；第二天就下地拉耙，政府果然给了粮食，每人每天一斤谷子（叶打拉因饿的瘦了，每天斤半），第一次共领到谷子三百多斤，后来又领了七十多斤，这样便鼓起了大家的劲头干下去。”
    “我们集体下地才两天，本村的徐三卫见了问我这是干啥的，我就将县长区长给贷粮、贷种要我们互助生产、自救的办法说给他，当天他就串连阎计真、阎正岁等五家，也领粮互助生产了，后来县长、区长也参加到我们组里，拉犁拉耙很带劲儿，这时已传遍了全村，大家纷纷要求互助生产，没几天就成立起十八个组。”
　  二、领导打蝗开展互助
    群众的情绪和新长起来的小苗一样，大家抱着满腔热望，不料小苗刚锄了头遍，蚂蚱来了。马区长就领导着群众白天打蝗，夜里割麦子，这时全村都有了编制，男女老幼齐出动送水送饭，打蝗都分了工，群众感到互助的好处，都说互助真好，这时韩县长与马区长因老英雄年岁老，让他率领三百多妇女，区长率领男子六七百人，没几天把蚂蚱打完了，可是把小苗也给吃光了，大家也正在发愁，偏偏下了一场透雨，于是接着打蝗组不散，二次贷种、再种，群众都亲眼见到互助起来力量大，好处多，等麦子打完场，互助组又添了六组，共为二十四组了，这时大家有了饭吃，一直互助生产到秋收，普遍都能落三四斗收成，各户都批到粮食，大家高兴的说：“要不是老英雄带头互助生产，咱们可活不到现在。”
