　　"Think about 1932, what if it doesn't rain?" Matou Village cadres in Qiu County, after clearing their minds, decided to engage in emergency planting for famine relief. Comrade Liu, the Minister of the County Party Committee, and Comrade Wang, the Director of the Anti-Japanese Association, assisted the village cadres in Matou on the evening of the 10th to study issues related to spot planting, emergency planting, and conservation. Initially, the village cadres said, "Our village has already sown all the cotton; there's no need for spot planting." "If we sow the millet too early, it will become old seedlings; it won't be too late to wait a few more days for rain." The leaders discovered that the village cadres had a serious mentality of relying on rain, so they asked, "Think about how much cotton the whole village used to plant, and how much did you plant this year?" "Have you finished planting your own land, or is there still some land that the masses haven't planted?" "What if the seedlings don't emerge fully?" "If we wait a few more days and it doesn't rain, will we still be able to sow the millet?" Through self-reflection and careful accounting, many problems were discovered: Wu Mei's cotton had not been planted because she was engaged in petty trading at the market and neglected agriculture. There was also a widowed old woman who had more than ten mu of land that had not been sown. Some of the sown land may not produce full seedlings due to small ridges and wind this year. From these specific problems, the village cadres changed their thinking that "there is no need for spot planting or emergency planting" and realized the importance of spot planting and emergency planting. Then, the conversation turned to conservation and famine relief, and everyone's spirit showed complacency: "It will always rain," "If it doesn't rain this year and there is no harvest in the fields, there will be a way." Qiu Shuyu, the militia squad leader, said: "I'll make some preparations. I used to eat corn flour at home, but now I've switched to sorghum flour. If it doesn't rain in another twenty days, I'll add half chaff." Minister Liu asked him, "Why wait another twenty days?" It turned out that he had a plan because he had some grain at home, and he thought that the autumn harvest would be enough to eat and drink. He was asked, "What if there is no harvest in the autumn?" After saying this, he was reminded, and everyone lowered their heads and said, "In 1932, we didn't prepare in advance, and we ate all the wheat after it was harvested. Later, we wanted to exchange it for coarse grains, but there was no grain stored at home. In the spring and winter, no one worked, and we just sat in the sun with our benches." Qiu Shuyu interrupted and said: "In 1932, I starved my wife away, and my younger brother was so hungry that he couldn't get up. Don't mention it. I understand now." After everyone's thinking was straightened out, they discussed "What should we do in the future?" The result of the discussion was to hold a meeting the next day to straighten out the masses' thinking, strive to finish planting all fifteen qing of millet land in the village in three days, and not wait for rain, and call on everyone to plant more melons. The cadres were willing to take the lead. The chairman of the Farmers' Association said: "I will plant a hundred or so more melon plants on the edge of the pit." Qiu Shuyu, who had planted cotton, was responsible for helping Wu Mei plant, and the chairman of the Farmers' Association was responsible for helping the widowed old woman plant. In terms of conservation, it was decided not to drink alcohol, smoke less, eat less good food, and make a plan for production and conservation for each household. Now the whole village has entered the emergency planting and famine relief campaign. (Note: The Matou area was a severely affected area in 1932)

　　邱县县委深入动员推动马头抢种备荒
    【本报冀南二十八日电】“想想三十二年，不下雨怎么办”，邱县马头村干部打通思想决定抢种备荒。县委会刘部长、抗联王主任于十号晚上在马头帮助村干研究开展点种、抢种及节约问题，一开始村干部说：“咱村棉花都耩上了，不用再点种”。“谷子耩的早了老苗，再等几天下了雨也不晚”。领导上发现村干部等雨麻痹思想严重，就提出“想想过去全村种多少棉，今年种了多少”？“自己地种完了，群众是否还有地没种的”？“苗出不全怎么办”？“再等几天不下雨，谷子是否还能耩”？从反省与细算账中发现很多问题：吴梅的棉花没点上，原因是在集上干小买卖，忽视农业。还有一个寡妇老太太十余亩地也没耩上。有些耩上的因今年垧小、风多，不一定能出全苗。从这些具体问题上，村干部们才转变“用不着点种、抢种”的思想，认识了点种抢种的重要。接着话头转到节约备荒上，大家的精神又表现出麻痹：“天总会下雨”，“天不下雨今年地里不收也有办法”。民兵班长邱书玉说：“我做做准备，以前家里吃玉米面，现在换成高粱面了，再等二十天不下雨就添一半糠”。刘部长问他“为啥再等二十天”？原来他肚里有底，家里有些粮食，秋里再一收吃喝不成问题。又问他：“假如秋里不收，怎么办”？经过这样一说，提醒了他，会上大家都低了头说：“三十二年咱事前没准备，打了麦子都吃了，后来想换粗粮，家里无存粮，春冬两季谁也不干活，拿着板橙晒太阳。”邱书玉截住说：“三十二年饿跑了老婆，小兄弟饿的爬不起来，不提了，我的思想通了。”大家的思想打通后，接着研究“今后怎么办？”讨论结果，决定第二天开会，打通群众思想，争取三天把全村十五顷谷地都种完，决不等雨，并号召多种瓜。干部都愿带头，农会主任说：“我在坑边上再多种百十棵瓜”。种上棉的邱书玉负责帮助吴梅种，农会主任负责帮助寡妇老太太种。在节约方面，决定不喝酒，少吸烟，少吃好的，每家作出生产节约的按家计划。现全村已进入抢种备荒行动中。（按马头一带为三十二年重灾区）
