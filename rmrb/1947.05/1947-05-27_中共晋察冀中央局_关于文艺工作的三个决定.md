The CCP Jin-Cha-Ji Central Bureau
　Three Decisions on Literary and Art Work
　(I) Decision on Developing Literary and Art Creation in the Border Region
　　I. Literary and art workers in the border region participated in the great struggle against the enemy and the construction of the base areas after the Anti-Japanese War, did a lot of work, produced many works, and made considerable contributions. Especially after Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," literary and art workers in the border region practiced the policy of integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers. Many new works appeared in various departments of literary and art creation, reflecting the lives and struggles of the masses; at the same time, they promoted literary and art work in rural areas and troops. These activities played a significant role in the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Patriotic Self-Defense War, rent reduction and production, and land reform, bringing the literary and art movement in the border region into a new stage. However, compared with the rapidly developing and infinitely rich real struggle, the reflection of literary and artistic creation still appears weak, especially during the Self-Defense War. Therefore, it is necessary to further develop literary and artistic creation.
　　II. At present, the people in the liberated areas are carrying out a large-scale Patriotic Self-Defense War. Our literature and art should serve the Patriotic Self-Defense War: reflecting the war, encouraging morale, and praising the new heroism of the people; reflecting the people's production, support for the army, preferential treatment to military families, and all actions and patriotic enthusiasm to win victory.
　　At the same time, our literature and art should reflect the unprecedented land reform movement in Chinese history. The vast number of poor and patriotic peasants have obtained land and broken the feudal shackles of thousands of years. Only the peasants who have turned over and changed their minds will pour into the front in large numbers to defend the fruits of victory, which is the richest source of strength for the Self-Defense War and will enable the Self-Defense War to achieve final victory.
　　III. Literary and art workers have played a significant role in helping literary and art work in rural areas, companies, and factories. Workers, peasants, and soldiers have demonstrated their rich creative talents. Literary and art workers should have sufficient understanding of this, humbly learn from them, and should continue to help them with greater strength, and pay attention to training literary and art cadres from workers, peasants, and soldiers.
　　IV. As a result of the combination of literary and art workers and the masses, many works have been produced in the creation that use the language of workers, peasants and soldiers, and are in forms that are welcomed by the masses. In order to widely reflect the rich and complex real life, all forms, as long as they are welcomed by the masses, should be given the opportunity to develop freely. At the same time, the literary and artistic heritage of China and foreign countries should be critically accepted. In particular, Chinese folk art should continue to be studied and researched.
　　V. In order to better serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, literary and art workers should more actively and deeply go into the storm of mass struggle and thoroughly transform their own thoughts and feelings. In order to better serve politics and more effectively express the new production of the masses, literary and art workers should study and grasp the various policies of each period and each movement, and constantly strengthen their own professional study.
　　VI. Leading organs at all levels should attach importance to the great role of literary and artistic creation in completing political tasks, promoting work, and educating the masses; they should strengthen the leadership of literary and artistic activities, help literary and artistic workers in terms of policy and ideology, provide convenient conditions for work, and should reward outstanding works and correct any possible deviations in literary and artistic work in a timely manner. Literary and art workers should maintain regular contact with each other, exchange and summarize experiences, so that the literary and art circles can better exert collective strength and continue to strive to complete the great anti-imperialist and anti-feudal task in literature and art.
　(II) Decision on Developing Rural Literary and Art Movement
　　I. After the Anti-Japanese War, the rural art movement in the border region has developed greatly; especially after Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," the border region put forward and implemented the direction of "Poor People's Happiness," which enabled this movement to enter a new stage on the basis of expanding the liberated areas and the great production movement. The new literature and art began to be consciously mastered by the broad masses of peasants, specifically reflecting and promoting the struggle against the enemy and the political and economic emancipation of the masses, enriching the lives of the masses, and educating the masses themselves. In all departments of literature and art, especially in drama, the rich creative talents of the masses were displayed, unfolding a brilliant page in the history of the new literature and art movement in the border region. At present, the development of rural art has the scale of a broad mass movement, and this movement should be further organized to closely cooperate with the Patriotic Self-Defense War, land reform, and the great production movement, so as to better serve the masses.
　　II. The direction of "Poor People's Happiness" in the border region is the concrete practice of Chairman Mao's literary and art policy in the mass literary and art movement, which has played a great guiding and promoting role in the development of rural art. The basic spirit of this direction is to fully develop the creativity of the working masses in literature and art, so that literature and art can serve the masses more directly and universally. The basic method of this direction is collective creation by the masses themselves. The Chai Village Drama Troupe in Pingshan is a good example of practicing the "Poor People's Happiness" direction. Its characteristics are: (1) Serving the masses wholeheartedly, acting according to the opinions of the masses, and being loved by the masses of the whole village; (2) Serving the central work in a timely and close manner; carrying out propaganda and education according to the ideological situation of the masses; (3) Not delaying production, not wasting money, and having the role of hard work, simplicity, unity and mutual assistance. All departments of rural art should learn their spirit according to the specific situation.
　　III. Rural art activities must be based on the needs and voluntary participation of the masses, starting from the amateur nature of the village drama troupe that does not deviate from production, adapting to the wartime environment in rural areas, obeying the war and production, not delaying service, not violating agricultural time, and the village drama troupe's expenses are solved by their own production and are not paid from the village's finances. Therefore, the rural art movement should generally be seasonal; it should be mainly based on the activities of the village; small-scale activities should be developed in large numbers, small plays should be performed, and other various small art forms (such as storytelling, peep shows, singing, fast talks, mural street poems, etc.) should be carried out; performing plays should not be particular about scenery, should not use or use less lamp oil, should not eat public meals, and should overcome certain extravagant waste and other styles that are divorced from the masses.
　　IV. Rural art creation reflects the content of the mass struggle. Most of the works are written about local real events, which are true, kind, and of great educational significance. In the future, we should mobilize the masses to create more, advocate reflecting local real events, show positive figures and heroic models, and correctly and appropriately criticize the shortcomings in the work and some negative and backward phenomena. In terms of creative form, we should try our best to adopt the forms that the masses choose, like, and are familiar with; that is, the new forms that the masses have critically accepted (such as drama, living newspaper, etc.); and the folk inherent forms that have been utilized and transformed (such as Bangzi, Yangko, storytelling, New Year pictures, etc.); in particular, the new opera created by the masses integrating folk drama, music, song and dance, drama, living newspaper, fast talk and other forms should be further developed.
　　V. Rural intellectuals and folk artists have made considerable and significant contributions to the rural art movement, and their strength should be better united and brought into play. Rural intellectuals generally have relatively close ties with the masses, but some of their thoughts and feelings are still at a certain distance from the working people, and they need to further go deep into the lives of the masses, learn from the masses, create together with the masses, and serve the masses wholeheartedly. Folk artists have a lot of experience and skills in art, but their ideological and artistic views still have some conservative and even backward parts, and they need to strengthen ideological study, absorb new experience, actively transform old forms, and create new forms.
　　VI. Professional literary and art groups and literary and art workers have played a major role in the development of literary and art work in the border region. At the same time, correctly solving the relationship between them and rural art is the central link in correctly solving the relationship between literary and art popularization and improvement. They should list rural art work as one of the main tasks (the main tasks of army literary and art groups and army literary and art workers are to serve the soldiers), humbly learn from the masses, and carry out the following specific tasks: (1) Studying, introducing and guiding rural art creation; (2) Cultivating typical examples and summarizing and exchanging experiences; (3) Training rural art cadres.
　　VII. The rural art movement is an important part of mass literary and art work. Leading organs at all levels must attach importance to and strengthen the leadership of rural art, grasp the direction politically, guide creation, review works, strengthen education and assistance to village drama troupes and other rural art workers; in the leadership of the village, they should pay attention to adjusting the relationship between rural art organizations and other mass organizations, and unify the leadership of cultural and educational activities.
　(III) Decision on Implementing the Policy of Serving the Soldiers and Developing Literary and Art Work in the Troops
　　I. The literary and art work of the Jin-Cha-Ji troops inherited the tradition of the Red Army era and became a powerful weapon of the political work of the troops in the environment of the cruel anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines, and played a great role. Since Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," the literary and art workers of the troops have undergone new changes in ideology and work. Especially since the Self-Defense War, significant progress and achievements have been made in firmly implementing the policy of serving the soldiers. Literary and art workers of the troops have actively gone deep into the companies, strengthened the role of enlivening the troops, boosting morale, and political education. In participating in the actual struggle of the troops, the literary and art workers themselves have also been transformed; the quantity and quality of the works reflecting the troops have increased and improved; the style of work has also been improved; at the same time, the literary and art activities of the companies have been promoted and helped. But it must be pointed out that the current achievements are still preliminary and unbalanced, and are far from meeting the needs of the troops and the war. Therefore, continuing to conscientiously implement the policy of serving the soldiers and developing literary and art work in the troops ideologically and in work is still an extremely important task.
　　II. The initial experience of the Anti-Enemy Drama Society of the Military Region in joining the army proves that: literary and art workers often go deep into the companies and live with the soldiers in the actual struggle, so that their own life, style, thought, and emotion gradually merge with them, and they are moved by their great heroic behavior. The literary and art works produced in this way are presented to the soldiers and are easily accepted, liked, and revised and enriched by them. At the same time, their own creative enthusiasm is aroused. The soldiers reflect their lives and struggles in wall newspapers, fast talks, singing, dancing, painting, and drama. It should be recognized that this kind of literary and art activity of the soldiers themselves is an important part of our troops' literary and art work. As long as it is organized and promoted, it will form a troops-wide literary and art movement. Literary and art workers are learning in the process of influencing and promoting the literary and art activities of the companies. As a result, the literary and art work of the entire troops will be fully developed. Therefore, in addition to their own creative activities, literary and art workers of the troops should use great strength to help the literary and art activities of the companies, so that the direction of "Poor People's Happiness" can also be implemented in the companies. We should take advantage of appropriate opportunities to develop mass literary and art movements in the troops in a planned way.
　　When carrying out activities, literary and art workers of the troops must adapt to the situation of the troops in large-scale mobile warfare, and flexibly grasp the methods of dispersion and concentration. In combat situations, literary and art work must actively and timely extend to the front line in a combat posture. The valuable experience of the front-line art work group (three to five people carrying portable machines, using the forms of drums, fast talks, and singing, i.e., compiling and performing), trench posters, combat newspapers, tunnel mobilization groups, mobilization sheds, and various political offensives in previous campaigns should be studied and promoted.
　　In short, to implement the policy of literary and art serving the soldiers, we must cultivate and give play to the artistic activity of the broad masses of soldiers and cadres, we must make literary and art workers of the troops participate in the actual struggle of the troops, we must make literary and art combine with the broad masses of soldiers and cadres, and combine with the basic and specific tasks of the troops in each period, in order to develop the mass literary and art movement of the troops; in order to transform the literary and art workers themselves; in order to transform the literary and art work of the troops and produce good works reflecting the troops and the war.
　　III. In order to implement the policy of literary and art serving the soldiers, the political organs of the troops must not only correctly grasp the principles in leadership, but also strengthen business leadership, and regularly check the work and summarize the experience. Attach importance to the artistic creative genius of the broad masses of soldiers and cadres, give timely encouragement and improvement; pay attention to cultivating and educating the literary and art workers of the troops: improve them ideologically, politically, and in work, and give them convenient conditions for work, and care about their lives.
　　IV. Some literary and art workers of the troops must realize that serving the soldiers is the most concrete way to serve the people. All literary and art workers of the troops should, without exception, wholeheartedly go deep into the companies and into the war to make contributions to the people. We should reflect the heroic achievements of the people's soldiers in the rich, vivid, and admirable Self-Defense War in a timely and correct manner, and assume the glorious task of consolidating and improving the combat effectiveness of the troops to defeat the enemy. The writers, artists, and literary and art workers in Jin-Cha-Ji should go to the troops more, go to the front more, and serve our great Patriotic Self-Defense War.

### 中共晋察冀中央局　关于文艺工作的三个决定

　　中共晋察冀中央局
  　关于文艺工作的三个决定
  　（一）开展边区文艺创作的决定
    一、边区文艺工作者，在抗战后即参加了伟大的对敌斗争与根据地的建设，做了许多工作，产生了不少作品，有相当贡献。特别是毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会讲话》以后，边区文艺工作者，实践了与工农兵结合的方针，在文艺创作的各个部门，出现了许多新的作品，反映了群众的生活和斗争；同时推动了乡村与部队文艺工作。这些活动对抗日与爱国自卫战争，对减租生产及土地改革，起了重大的作用，使边区的文艺运动，进入了新的阶段。但是比起急遽发展与无限丰富的现实斗争，文艺创作的反映依然显得薄弱，尤其是自卫战争时期，更显得不够。因此，有进一步开展文艺创作的必要。
    二、目前解放区人民正进行着大规模的爱国自卫战争，我们的文艺应该为爱国主义的自卫战争服务：反映战争、鼓励士气，歌颂人民的新英雄主义；反映人民的生产、拥军、优抗和一切为了取得胜利的行动与爱国热忱。
    同时我们的文艺应该反映中国历史上空前未有的土地改革运动，广大的贫苦爱国农民获得了土地，打碎了几千年的封建枷锁；也只有翻了身和翻了心的农民，大量的涌向前方，保卫既得的胜利果实，才是自卫战争力量的最丰富的源泉，将使自卫战争取得最后的胜利。
    三、文艺工作者在帮助乡村、连队与工厂文艺工作中，起了很大作用。工农兵群众已表现他们丰富的创作才能，文艺工作者对它应有足够的认识，虚心向他们学习，而且应该以更大的力量，继续帮助他们，并注意培养工农兵文艺干部。
    四、由于文艺工作者与群众结合的结果，在创作上产生了很多用工农兵的语言，为群众所喜见乐闻的形式的作品。为了广泛反映丰富复杂的现实生活，各种形式，只要是为群众所欢迎的，都应该使他们有自由发展的机会。同时应批判地接受中外的文艺遗产。而特别是对中国民间文艺，应继续学习与研究。
    五、为了更好的为工农兵服务，文艺工作者应更踊跃和更深入到群众斗争的暴风雨中去，彻底改造自己的思想感情。为了更好的服务政治和更有力的表现群众的新的生产，文艺工作者应研究与掌握每一时期，每一运动的各种政策，并不断地加强自己的业务学习。
    六、各级领导机关，应重视文艺创作在完成政治任务，推动工作，教育群众上的巨大作用；应加强对文艺活动的领导，在政策思想上帮助文艺工作者，给予工作上的便利条件，并应奖励优秀作品，及时纠正文艺工作中可能发生的偏向。文艺工作者相互之间，应经常取得联系，交换总结经验，使文艺界更能发挥集体力量，为完成文艺上的反帝反封建的伟大任务而继续奋斗。
　  （二）开展乡村文艺运动的决定
    一、抗战后边区的乡艺运动，即有了很大的发展；特别在毛主席文艺座谈会讲话以后，边区提出和执行了“穷人乐”的方向，在扩大解放区和大生产运动的基础上，使这一运动进入了新的阶段。新文艺开始为广大农民群众自觉的掌握，具体的反映与推动了对敌斗争及群众政治经济上的翻身，充实了群众生活，并教育了群众自己。在文艺各部门中，特别是戏剧上，表现了群众丰富的创造才能，展开了边区新文艺运动史上灿烂的一页。目前乡艺发展已具有广大群众运动的规模，应进一步的组织这个运动，密切配合爱国自卫战争，土地改革和大生产运动，更好的为群众服务。
    二、边区的“穷人乐”方向，是毛主席文艺方针在群众文艺运动上的具体实践，对乡艺的发展起了极大的指导与推动作用。这个方向的基本精神，是充分发扬劳动群众在文艺上的创造性，使文艺更直接普遍的为群众服务。这个方向的基本方法，是群众亲自动手的集体创作。平山柴庄村剧团是实践“穷人乐”方向的一个好榜样，它的特点：（一）全心全意为群众服务，按群众意见办事，为全村群众所喜爱；（二）及时密切的为中心工作服务；针对群众思想情况，进行宣传教育；（三）不误生产，不浪费金钱，有艰苦朴素，团结互助的作用。乡艺的各个部门，应根据具体情况，学习他们的精神。
    三、乡艺活动必须以群众的需要与自愿为原则，从村剧团不脱离生产的业余性质出发，适应农村战时环境，服从战争与生产、不误勤务，不违农时，村剧团经费由自己生产解决，不在村财政中开支，因此，乡艺运动一般的应有季节性；应以本村活动为主，应大量发展小型活动，演小戏及进行其它各种艺术小形式（如说书、洋片、歌咏、快板、壁画街头诗等）的活动；演戏不讲求布景，不用或少用灯油，不吃公饭，克服某些铺张浪费及其他脱离群众的作风。
    四、乡艺创作，反映了群众斗争的内容，大多数作品写本地实事，真实、亲切，教育意义很大。今后应更加大量发动群众创作，提倡反映本地实事，表现积极人物与英雄模范，正确适当的批评工作中的缺点与某些消极落后现象。在创作形式上，应尽量采用群众自己选择的，喜爱的，熟悉的形式；即群众批判的接受了的新形式（如话剧、活报等）；利用与改造了的民间固有形式（如梆子、秧歌、说书、年画等）；特别是群众综合民间戏剧，音乐、歌舞、话剧、活报、快板等各种形式所创造的新歌剧，更应该发展。
    五、乡村知识分子与民间艺人，在乡艺运动中有相当重大的贡献，应更好的团结与发挥他们的力量。乡村知识分子一般与群众有比较密切的联系，但他们有些思想感情，还和劳动人民有一定的距离，需要进一步深入群众生活，向群众学习，与群众共同创作，全心全意为群众服务。民间艺人在艺术上有很多经验和技能，但他们的思想艺术观点还有某些保守甚至落后的部分，需要加强思想学习，吸取新的经验，积极改造旧形式，创造新形式。
    六、专业文艺团体和文艺工作者，在边区文艺工作的开展上起了重大作用。同时，正确解决他们与乡艺的关系，乃是正确解决文艺普及与提高的关系的中心环节。他们应把乡艺工作列为主要任务之一（部队文艺团体和部队文艺工作者主要任务是为兵服务），虚心向群众学习，并进行以下的具体工作：（一）研究、介绍及指导乡艺创作；（二）培养典型，总结交流经验；（三）培养训练乡艺干部。
    七、乡艺运动是群众文艺工作的一个重要部分，各级领导机关，须重视与加强乡艺的领导，在政治上掌握方向，指导创作，审查作品，加强对村剧团和其他乡艺工作者的教育与帮助；在村的领导上，应注意调整乡艺组织与其他群众组织间的关系，并统一文教活动的领导。
  　（三）贯彻为兵服务方针，开展部队文艺工作决定
    一、晋察冀部队文艺工作，继承红军时代的传统，在残酷的敌后抗日游击战争的环境中成为部队政治工作的有力武器，起了很大作用。从毛主席《文艺座谈会讲话》以后，部队文艺工作者在思想上工作上有了新的变化。特别是自卫战争以来，在坚决执行为兵服务的方针下，有了显著的进步和成绩。部队文艺工作者积极深入连队，加强了活跃部队，鼓舞士气、与政治教育的作用。在参加部队的实际斗争中，也改造了文艺工作者自己；反映部队的作品，量与质均有增加与提高；工作作风亦有改进；同时推动与帮助了连队的文艺活动。但必须指出，现在的成绩还是初步的和不平衡的，还远不能满足部队和战争的需要。因此，从思想上、工作上继续认真贯彻为兵服务的方针，开展部队文艺工作，仍然是极其重要的任务。
    二、军区政治部抗敌剧社入伍的初步经验证明：文艺工作者经常的深入连队，和战士共同生活在实际斗争当中，使自己的生活、作风、思想、感情，逐渐和他们溶合在一起，为他们伟大的英雄行为所感动，这样产生的文艺作品，再现在战士面前，就容易被接受、喜好，并得到他们的修正与充实，同时更激起了自己的创造热情。战士们把自己的生活和斗争，反映在墙报、快板、歌咏、舞蹈、绘画和戏剧中。应该认识这种战士们自己的文艺活动，是我们部队文艺工作的重要部分，只要加以组织和推动，就会形成部队性的文艺运动。文艺工作者在影响与推动连队文艺活动的过程中，得到学习。这样的结果，就会使整个部队的文艺工作，全面的开展起来。因此部队文艺工作者除了本身的创作活动外，应以很大力量帮助连队文艺活动，使“穷人乐”方向在连队中也得到贯彻。应利用适当时机，有计划的开展部队群众性的文艺运动。
    部队文艺工作者进行活动时必须适应大规模运动战中的部队情况，灵活的掌握分散与集中的方法。在作战情况下，文艺工作必须主动及时的以战斗的姿态伸展到火线上去。历次战役中火线艺术工作组（三人至五人携带轻便机器，采用大鼓、快板、歌唱形式，即编即演）和战壕画报、战斗小报，坑道鼓动组，鼓动棚以及政治攻势中的各种宝贵经验，应予以研究和推广。
    总之，要贯彻文艺为兵服务的方针，必须培养与发挥广大战士与干部艺术活动的积极性与创造性，必须使部队文艺工作者参加部队的实际斗争，必须使文艺与广大战士干部相结合，与部队基本的和各个时期具体的任务相结合，才能开展部队群众性的文艺运动；才能改造文艺工作者自己；才能改造部队文艺工作，产生反映部队和战争的好作品。
    三、为了贯彻文艺为兵服务方针，部队政治机关在领导上不但要正确的掌握原则，还必须加强业务领导，经常检查工作与总结经验。重视广大战士干部的艺术创造天才，予以及时的鼓励和提高；注意培养与教育部队文艺工作者：从思想上、政治上、工作上提高他们，并予以工作上的便利条件，及关心他们的生活。
    四、一些部队文艺工作者，必须认识，为兵服务，就是最具体的为人民服务。一切部队文艺工作者，应该毫无例外的，全心全意的深入连队，投入战争中去为人民立功。把丰富、生动、可歌可泣的自卫战争中的人民子弟兵英勇战绩及时正确的反映出来，负起巩固提高部队战斗力战胜敌人的光荣任务。在晋察冀的文学家、艺术家、文艺工作者们，应该更多的到部队中去，到前线上去，为我们伟大的爱国自卫战争服务。
