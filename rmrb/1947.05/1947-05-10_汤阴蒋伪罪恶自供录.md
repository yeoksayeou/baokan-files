　　The Self-Confessed Crimes of the Chiang Kai-shek Clique in Tangyin

　　In the construction section of the Chiang Kai-shek county government in Tangyin, I found a "Blockhouse Volume" labeled January to March 22nd, 36th year of the Republic (1947). Opening the first page, it was the "Minutes of the Establishment Meeting of the Procurement Committee for Construction Materials" held at 3:00 PM on January 7th. The attending organizations included the Kuomintang County Party Headquarters, the Three People's Principles Youth League, the County Council, the Headquarters of the Provisional Third Column of the Ministry of National Defense (i.e., the pseudo-Third Column of Sun Dianying, the traitor), the County Government, the Police Bureau, and the Construction Section. They planned to build nine fortified villages and 439 blockhouses on the Pinghan Road, which was only 32 li (approximately 10 miles) long. Regarding the materials used for the construction work, their "resolution" stated: (1) The principle of demolishing civilian houses is that the households should demolish their own houses to avoid "disturbing" them. (2) All public temples, "bandit" houses, ruined houses, houses of escaped households, or houses that obstruct military needs should be demolished. (3) Civilian land, civilian schools, and tombs should be requisitioned according to the needs of the project. (4) Supervisors, managers, or laborers who fail to complete their tasks on time will be put in shackles and forced into hard labor for a week. Laborers who escape will be fined five dou of grain per day, and the grain obtained from the fines will be used to "reward" meritorious personnel. (5) Each laborer must bring their own hoe and 25 jin of millet as rations. In addition to food, supervisors will be paid 1,600 yuan, and soldiers will be paid 1,400 yuan per day by the supervisor's office. The running dogs of the Chiang family went to the countryside to urge and supervise the laborers, causing great disturbance. Even their henchman, the chief of the large township, Meng Zhaocheng, couldn't bear it and wrote in a memorial to the Chiang Kai-shek county magistrate on March 12th: "Wang Ruiqing, the on-duty township supervisor, will be amiable and generous if treated with wine and meat. I have hosted him at restaurants for three days. Yesterday, because I was busy with official duties and did not drink with him, he became furious and threatened me in every way." Sun Dianying also revealed in an official letter to the Chiang Kai-shek county magistrate: "Wang Qishan, the material requisition officer sent by the county magistrate, accepted bribes of 170,000 yuan in Houjia Village." As a result, the "common people" were subjected to unbearable levies. A petition from the Wuling Town Government stated: "Wuling Town has 36 large and small blockhouses, no less than 540 zhang of moats, and more than 330 zhang of ramparts. The labor and materials for the trench covers on the ramparts are countless. The people can no longer sustain it. Now, the Third Column (pseudo-Sun Dianying's unit) and the Security Training Column are constructing trenches and adding a large blockhouse and eight small blockhouses along the Weihe River bank from Wuling to Daliu Village, a distance of more than ten li, along with six kitchens. The materials needed include 256 beams and pillars, 30 six-foot-long and eight-inch-wide boards, 100,000 jin of sorghum stalks, 20 bricks, 1,200 laborers, and 40 mud and carpentry workers. It is impossible to meet this demand with the limited manpower available." The people of Tangyin City suffered even more. Zhu Yourui, a resident of the Tenth Bao of the West Gate, wrote in a petition: "In October of the 34th year of the Republic (1945), civilian houses were demolished. Now, the foundations are being dug into trenches, more than one zhang wide and long, and the entire base is occupied. Food, clothing, shelter, and transportation are the four basic necessities of life. Now, a family of eleven has no place to settle down and is exposed to the elements. The situation is truly tragic and desolate..." The soulless traitorous traitors do not care about these things. At an emergency meeting on March 9th, they resolved: "The rations owed to each township must be fully supplied as soon as possible. If there is any further delay in delivery, they will be charged with obstructing official business and colluding with bandits and will not be tolerated." How much intense bloody smell permeates this!

　　汤阴蒋伪罪恶自供录
    我在汤阴蒋记县政府建设科的卷橱中发现一本“碉寨卷”旁边注明三十六年一月到三月二十二日。翻开第一页，是“征购工料委员会成立会议记录”一月七日三时召开的，出席机关有国民党县党部、三青团、县参议会、国防部暂编三纵队总司令部（即孙逆殿英伪三纵队）、县政府、警察局及建设科等，他们在不过卅二华里的平汉路上，要建筑九个围寨，四百三十九座碉堡。修筑工事所用的器材，他们的“决议”里这样记载着：（一）撤拆民房的原则由户人自行拆房，以免“惊扰”。（二）凡公共庙宇、“奸匪”房屋、已毁坏之房屋、逃亡户之房屋或有碍于军事之房屋，均予撤拆。（三）民地、民校、坟墓，视工程之需要而征用之。（四）督工人员、管理人员或民夫，不能如期完成者带脚镣罚苦役一周，民夫逃逸者一日罚粮五斗，罚得之粮“奖励”有功人员。（五）民夫每人自带镢锄。及口粮小米二十五斤。督工人员每日除火食外，由督工处发洋一千六百元。士兵每天一千四百元。蒋家走狗下乡催夫督工，闹得鸡犬不宁，连他们的爪牙大乡长孟昭诚也逼得受不了，在他三月十二日给蒋记县长一篇呈文里写着：“王瑞卿在职乡监工，如能酒肉相待，即和颜悦色赐予宽大，职曾在饭馆筵请三日。昨因公未同伊饮酒，即大发雷霆，诸万恐吓。”孙逆殿英给蒋记县长公函里也透露：“县长所派征料员王岐山，在侯家庄受贿有十七万元。”于是，“小民”就被征收得受不了。五陵镇公所一件呈文说道：“五陵镇村大小碉堡卅六个，城壕不下五百四十丈，寨墙三百三十余丈，寨墙上战沟盖板工料无以数计，民众已无法维持，今更有三纵队（伪孙殿英部）、保安集训纵队，自五陵顺卫河堡岸至大刘村十余里，增筑战沟，加设大碉楼一座，小碉堡八座，厨房六间。所须工料有梁柱二百五十六根，寸板六尺长八寸宽三十块。高粱秸十万斤，砖二十个，民夫一千二百名，泥木工四十名，以有限民力应此差役，实无法应命。”汤阴城人民更苦，西关十保居民，朱有瑞一张呈文里写着：“三十四年十月，将民房拆毁，今又将房基掘成战沟，宽长丈余，基地全部占用，查衣、食、住、行是人之四大要素，现在民家十一人，已无安身立锥之地，飘落露宿，情实悲惨凄凉………。”没有人心的卖国汉奸是不管这些的，他们在三月九日的紧急会议上决议：“各乡镇所给养一项，克日补足，如再迟延不送，定以阻碍公事通奸论罪，决不姑息。”这里面充满了多么浓烈的血腥气味呀。（方德）
