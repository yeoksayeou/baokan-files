Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th: Shanghai News: According to preliminary statistics, the rice-snatching wave in the Chiang Kai-shek-controlled areas in early May has already involved more than 30 counties, including Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Suzhou, Wuxi, Hangzhou, Chengdu, Shouchang, Yongkang, Chongming, Shaoxing, Qu County, Wuxing, Songjiang, Hefei, Wuhu, Pukou, Yichang, Jiangshan, Anqing, and various places in northern Henan. The intensity of the snatching is unprecedented. In Hangzhou, 40,000 starving people seized rice, and more than 300 rice shops were looted. According to incomplete statistics (excluding the counties in the Chiang Kai-shek-controlled areas of northern Henan), the number of starving people who seized rice is more than 150,000. In Wuxing, the starving people who seized rice used red and green paper as slogans, with the words "Follow me to get food!" written on them; when they arrived at the rice shop, they shouted, "Please save us dying little people!" Their mournful cries resounded throughout the city. In Shouchang, an old woman who was seizing rice cried as she seized, "We can't print banknotes, we haven't had a grain of rice for days, please save our lives!" During the rice seizure in Hangzhou, the grain administration staff of Chiang Kai-shek's government and the police chief were beaten by starving people. During the rice seizure in Wuxi, the starving people destroyed the county government and paraded the county government's horizontal plaque through the streets. The stored rice in Anqing was all looted, the bank was destroyed, and the private residences of the bank president, the Chamber of Commerce directors, and others were also destroyed by the masses. In addition to seizing grain, starving people in Beiping also seized sesame seed cakes in the bustling areas such as Dongxi Pai Lou.
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th: Shanghai News: At the Nanjing Chiang Kai-shek National Political Council, many councilors expressed deep sympathy for the students' anti-hunger, anti-civil war demonstrations and protested the "May 20th" massacre. Xu Deheng said: "The brutal suppression of students on May 20th violates Article 10 of the administrative policy. This article stipulates that the people's freedom of person, freedom of speech and publication, and freedom of assembly and association are guaranteed. Now, instead of giving students peaceful advice, they send cavalry, infantry, military police to suppress them. What is the basis for this? The constitution also stipulates the freedom of petition. Therefore, I want to ask: Is the 'Temporary Measures for Maintaining Order' based on law? Today, the people of the whole country unanimously demand peace. The people petition the government because they want to do so." Huang Yanpei said: "In Shanghai, an average of more than 2,000 corpses of people who have starved to death are found every day, lying on the streets. This is the pain caused by the civil war. I think the civil war is intolerable, and the students are right to petition the government." Liang Shuming pointed out: "The government should bear full responsibility for the bloody massacre of unarmed students by the police."

　　蒋区民不聊生
    京杭等地抢米饥民达十五万上海每日平均饿死两千多人
    【新华社陕北廿七日电】沪息：本月初旬蒋管区之抢米风潮，据初步统计：已有南京、上海、北平、苏州、无锡、杭州、成都、寿昌、永康、崇明、绍兴、衢县、吴兴、松江、合肥、芜湖、浦口、宜昌、江山、安庆、及豫北各地等卅余县。抢风之猛烈，空前未有。杭州抢米饥民达四万人，被抢米店达三百余家。抢米饥民据不完全统计（豫北蒋管区各县不计在内），数在十五万人以上。吴兴抢米饥民以红绿纸作标语，上书“要吃饭的跟我来”；到米店门口时，高喊：“你们救救我们垂死的小百姓吧！”哀声震遍全城。寿昌一抢米之老妇边抢边哭：“我们不会印大钞，我们好几天没有一颗米下肚了，救救命吧！”杭州抢米时，蒋记之粮政科员与警局长被饥民殴打。无锡抢米时，饥民捣毁县府，并将县府之横匾抬出游行。安庆之存米被抢光，银行被捣毁，行长、商会理事等人私邸亦均被群众捣毁。北平饥民除抢粮外，并在东西牌楼等闹市抢烧饼。
    【新华社陕北廿七日电】沪息：南京蒋记国民参政会上，参政员多人对学生之反饥饿、反内战大游行深表同情，并抗议“五、二○”惨案。许德珩说：“五月二十日对学生的残酷镇压，是违反施政方针第十条的。该条规定保障人民身体自由，言论出版自由，集会结社自由。现在不给学生以和平的劝告，反而派遣骑步宪警镇压，是根据什么？宪法并规定有请愿自由，因之，我要问：“维持秩序临时办法，”是不是根据法律的？今日全国人民一致要求和平，人民向政府请愿，是因为他们想这样做。”黄炎培说：“上海平均每日发现饿死的尸首二千多具，横陈大街，这是内战引起的惨痛，我认为内战是不能容忍的，学生向政府请愿是对的。”梁漱溟指出：“警察对赤手空拳的学生的血腥屠杀，政府应负完全责任。”
