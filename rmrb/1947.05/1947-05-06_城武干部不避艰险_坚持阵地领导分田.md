(JiluYu News Agency, 4th) Chengwutownship is carrying out land reform amidst war. When the enemy occupied the city for the second time, the county's democratic government maintained its position, but failed to implement land reform during the guerrilla warfare. The cadres believed the area was unstable and the masses were being slaughtered by the enemy, and thought that proposing land reform would definitely be opposed by the peasants. After investigation and research, it was discovered that it was not that the masses dared not want it, but that the cadres did not give the masses enough support. After the cadres' thinking was straightened out, the county committee made a preliminary summary and decided that land reform would be carried out in all eight districts of the county without exception. The movement is now in full swing in various districts. The Third and Sixth Districts have mostly recovered the landlords' land and distributed it to the peasants. The ×× district's Dan Village is only five or six miles away from the area where the enemy is active. Last year, when the enemy invaded, ten members of the two farmers' association heads' families in the village were killed by bad elements, and the steel gun team members were also persecuted. When our district cadres arrived at the village, the masses initially dared not approach them, fearing trouble. Later, when the landlords and bad elements were having a grand feast, our district cadres suddenly entered, and the bad elements fled in fright. The masses' emotions immediately surged. Although the enemy raided Dan Village again the next day, and the bad elements returned and killed the head of the farmers' association, our team immediately besieged the village at dawn, arrested the murderers, suppressed them on the spot, and held a solemn funeral ceremony for the martyred head of the farmers' association, and gave appropriate condolences to the descendants of the deceased. Afterwards, the masses' emotions rose even higher. On April 1st, a village meeting was held to announce the land reform decree, and the district cadres expressed their determination to persist in the area. The whole village then vigorously carried out land reform, and within three days the peasants had initially distributed the land, and the village immediately showed a new atmosphere.

　　城武干部不避艰险
    坚持阵地领导分田
    【本报冀鲁豫四日电】城武在战争中进行土地改革。敌人第二次侵占该城时，该县民主政府坚持了阵地，但未能在游击战争中实行土地改革，干部认为地区不稳，群众又遭受敌人的残杀，以为提出土地改革定遭农民反对。经过调查研究，发现不是群众不敢要，而是干部没有给群众足够撑腰。干部思想上搞通以后，县委会作了初步总结，决定全县八个区无例外的均进行土地改革，现运动正在各区热烈开展中。三、六区已大部追回地主土地，分到农民手里。××区单庄，距敌人经常活动地区仅五、六里，去年敌人侵占时，该庄两个农会长十一口人曾被坏蛋杀死十口人，钢枪队员亦被坏蛋迫害，我区干部到该村时，起初群众不敢接近，都怕惹祸；后来在地主坏蛋大请客正热闹的时候，我区干部突然进去，坏蛋们吓跑了。群众情绪立即高涨起来，虽然第二天敌人又袭入单庄，坏蛋又回去杀了农会长，但我队拂晓即围攻该庄，逮住了杀人凶手，当场给以镇压，并给被害的农会长举行了隆重的安葬典礼，对死难的后代也予以适当的安慰。以后群众情绪更高涨起来。四月一日召开了村民大会，宣布了土地改革法令，区干并表示坚持地区的决心，全村便轰轰烈烈的进行土地改革，前后三天农民即初步分到土地，村里立即显出新气象。
