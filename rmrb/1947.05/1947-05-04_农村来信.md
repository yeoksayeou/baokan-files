    "…Recently, I've also learned about some issues with professional theatrical troupes. They are doing very well, such as the Liming Theatrical Troupe, the Tunliu Theatrical Troupe, and many other county troupes mentioned above. However, from what I've gathered in the past half-month, there are two urgent problems that need to be solved: One is that some professional troupes perform more old plays and fewer new plays; they perform old plays with enthusiasm, but new plays are performed poorly (therefore, the audience's enthusiasm also diminishes accordingly). The other is high expenses and high ticket prices. According to Section Chief Xu of the Licheng Culture and Education Section, a certain famous new theatrical troupe performed for three days in a certain place in the county, and the ticket revenue was more than 100,000 yuan. Food, drinks, gasoline, makeup, and miscellaneous expenses (including serving wine and dishes from the audience to the stage during performances, scattering peanuts, red dates, etc.) also cost more than 100,000 yuan, totaling about 300,000 yuan. They studied the costs after the fact with the village cadres, and found that the cost of these three days of performances exceeded the village's annual burden. It's truly shocking! A certain middle-class family spent a total of 5,000 yuan on apportionments and inviting relatives to watch the plays during these three days; if we also consider the valuable labor force during the current spring plowing, it's even more alarming. Therefore, I think we should pay more attention to the problems of professional theatrical troupes in the future and hope to send someone to conduct research on this issue, so that they can improve politically and artistically, which is urgently needed…"

    "…According to the existing materials, there are many problems with the current professional theatrical troupes. According to the summary materials of the Second District Education Conference not long ago, performing old plays has become a trend. Even many old plays that were previously banned are being performed under the temptation of making money. ...In rural areas, the trend of hiring teachers at high prices is rampant. Xiangtangpu spent 280,000 yuan to hire an old teacher. Changle Village spent 200,000 yuan to hire an old teacher to stage an old play called 'Lu Mengzheng Drives Away the Disaster'. Several villages in Zuoquan and Wuxiang are also doing the same. As for the masses, the reason why they love to watch old plays and are willing to spend a lot of money to write plays is related to excessive eating and drinking after the liberation. This issue is indeed worth studying.
    Regarding mass cultural and recreational activities, according to the summary materials of ten counties, this year's achievements are astonishing, and the scale is grand and magnificent, which is incomparable to previous years. It is a pity that it is only temporary. The brilliant achievements and correct political and organizational line of this movement cannot be adopted by professional theatrical troupes and combined with them. In a sense, the two are even moving in opposite directions, which is truly regrettable and worrying. Based on this situation, I have a preliminary idea, that is, in the past, we probably did not give the Spring Festival cultural and recreational activities a proper evaluation, and clearly regarded it as a starting point for guiding the mass cultural activities of the year; and also consider how professional theatrical troupes can inherit all the brilliant achievements and creations of the Spring Festival. I would like to find more materials in the future to continue studying this issue…"

    “………最近也了解了一些职业剧团的问题。他们工作得很有成绩，如上面说的黎明剧团、屯留剧团及其他很多县的剧团，但是据我这半月来所知道的，也有两个迫切需要解决的问题：一个是在某些职业剧团中，旧戏演的多，新戏演的少；旧戏演的起劲，新戏就演的差一些（因此观众看的劲头也就随之差劲了）。一个是花费大，戏价高。据黎城文教科徐科长和我谈，某有名新剧团，在该县某处演戏三天，戏价了要十余万元，吃喝、汽油、化装费、零星化销（包括在演戏中途从台下往台上送上盘酒菜，往台上撒花生、红枣等等）也十余万元，全部约三十万元。据事后他们与村干部研究，这三天唱戏的花费，超过该村全年的负担。真是吓人！某一中等人家，在这三天内连摊派及请亲友看戏，全部花了五千元；如果再算上目前春耕时的宝贵劳动力，就更加惊人了。所以我觉得我们今后应更加重视职业剧团的问题，希望能专门派人进行这项研究工作，使他们在政治上、艺术上提高一步，是迫切需要的……………。”
  （其二）
    “………根据现有材料来看，现在职业化的剧团，问题很多。据不久前二分区教育会议的总结材料上看，演旧戏已经成为一种风气了。甚至很多过去禁演的旧戏，在赚钱的诱惑下，也出演了。……在农村方面来说，大请教师之风甚炽，向堂铺曾花了二十八万请了个旧教师。长乐村用二十万请一个旧教师排了一个旧戏《吕蒙正赶灾》，左权、武乡有好些村庄也是如此。在群众方面来说，他们所以爱看旧戏，愿花大价钱写戏，则是与翻身后的大吃大喝有关。这个问题确是值得研究。
    在群众文娱活动上，根据十个县的总结材料来看，今年的成绩是惊人的，规模之宏大、雄伟，确非往年可比。可惜只是一时的。而这一运动的光辉成就与正确的政治与组织路线，不能为职业化的剧团所采纳，而互相结合起来，甚至在某种意义上讲，两者是背道而驰的，确使人惋惜、焦虑。根据这样一种情况，我初步有这样一个想法，就是过去我们恐怕都没有把春节文娱活动给一个适当的估价，把它明确地作为指导本年度的群众文艺活动的一个起点；而又使得职业化剧团，如何来继承春节中这一切光辉的成就与创造。我想在今后找更多的材料来继续研究这个问题。……”
