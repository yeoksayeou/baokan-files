Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th. The Shanghai Wen Cui magazine carries an article stating that Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary group has become aware of its impending defeat and is lamenting. The article lists the following facts as proof: The Chiang faction's organ publication, Li Xing Bi-monthly, issue 31, states: "No matter what, we have made a mistake on one point. World War III will not break out so quickly, and the strength of the Chinese Communists is unexpectedly strong... We must, before the 'public enemy' (referring to the people's forces) strangles us, ...fight to the death with the 'public enemy.' History dictates that the general situation in China will inevitably change after half a year... We cannot allow the enemy (referring to the people) to use this change to overthrow us, and implicate everyone." Song Ziwen also stated at a certain National Defense Conference that "overthrow" is unavoidable. He said: "Before last September, we could still have had a way (referring to salvaging the economic crisis), but now I know there is no way, really no way!" "A complete collapse will occur within June." Hu Zongnan anxiously said in his telegram: "If the strategic errors of the war are not quickly remedied, then in one year, there will be no soldiers to fight." And the Central Daily News is even more worried about the outbreak of popular uprisings, calling it "the most distressing crisis."

　　军事政治经济危机严重威胁南京政府
    蒋家喽罗绝望哀鸣
    【新华社陕北十六日电】沪文萃杂志载：蒋介石反动集团已觉察失败而发出哀鸣。该文列举如下事实作证：蒋记复兴系机关刊物力行半月刊三十一期上说：“无论如何，我们有一点弄错了，第三次世界大战并不会那么快就爆发，中共实力也意外坚强，……我们要在‘公敌’（按指人民力量）还未扼到我们的喉咙以前，……与‘公敌’决一雌雄，历史注定中国大势半年以后非变不可……我们不能让敌人（指人民）把这个变化覆亡我们，而连累大家。”宋子文亦在某次国防会议上，认为“覆亡”之不可避免。他说：“去年九月以前，我们还可以有办法（按即挽救经济危机），现在我知道没有办法，真的没有办法了！”“六月内会发生完全的崩溃。”胡宗南曾在他的电报中着急地说：“战争之失策如不迅予补救，则一年之后，将无可战之兵。”而中央日报更忧虑着民变蜂起，称之为“最苦恼的危机”。
