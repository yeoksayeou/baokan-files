    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The × Column, in its Jinan campaign, turned over to the government warehouse all the grain seized, except for the amount used for transportation, rewards, and relief for the troops, militia, and civilians. This included approximately 30,000 *shi* of grain, 150,000 *jin* of salt, and approximately 200,000 *jin* of cotton. Furthermore, the × Column recovered Hua County and Jun County, seizing 97,150 *jin* of rice, 97,240 *jin* of white flour, 18,000 *jin* of wheat, and 34,000 *jin* of coarse grains, all of which were handed over to the Jun County government for reception.

    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] Following the Jiluyu Postal District Bureau's saving of 8,600 *jin* of millet since January of this year, it has now responded to the administrative office's call for clearing public and private savings in preparation for a major counter-offensive, launching a donation movement. After mobilization, everyone realized that individual interests should be subordinate to revolutionary interests. On the 17th of last month, a self-reporting conference for donations of money and grain was held for all employees, launching a revolutionary competition. The 49 people present donated a total of 500,000 yuan in grain, firewood, and cash (local currency). The bureau also handed over all of its only 500,000 yuan in production from last year, totaling one million yuan. (Zhang Boda)
