Xinhua News Agency, Jilu Yu, 28th: (Delayed dispatch) The Jilu Yu Seventh Military Sub-district militia, in coordination with a portion of local armed forces, recovered Dongping City on the 21st. The stubborn puppet troops guarding the city fled in disarray. Our local armed forces intercepted and annihilated a portion of the enemy at the Beida Bridge north of the city, killing 15 enemies, capturing 21 alive, and seizing one vehicle. We only expended 200 rounds of ammunition.
This newspaper, Jilu Yu, 28th: A certain unit of the Sixth Military Sub-district local corps annihilated an enemy company, creating a glorious battle example of 2 to 60. After breakfast on the 14th, the Yun Mao-cai puppet security regiment, consisting of three companies with more than 200 men, who had invaded Changqing east of the Yellow River, went to Hexi County to plunder property. They made contact with the local troops of the area. Under the heroic attack of the brave soldiers of our unit, the enemy could not withstand and fled. Another unit of ours outflanked the enemy's escape route. After 20 minutes of battle, we annihilated one enemy company, capturing 21 enemies (including one instructor and one platoon leader each), killing and wounding 20, and drowning more than 20 who jumped into the Yellow River (including one company commander and one platoon leader each), totaling more than 50. We seized three light machine guns, 22 rifles, 1,700 rounds of ammunition, and 18 bombs. We only suffered two minor injuries.
This newspaper, Jilu Yu, 29th: The Nanhua militia persisted in guerrilla warfare, annihilating 71 enemies in 17 days from the 16th of last month to the 2nd of this month. In early this month, the remnants of Chiang Kai-shek's army, including Mi Wenhe, Liu Ruzhen, and Cao Fulin, concentrated more than 1,000 men to repeatedly "mop up" our Nanhua central area. Nanhua cadres and local armed forces, in order to resolutely safeguard the interests of the masses, persisted in operating within the enemy's encirclement, inflicting heavy blows on them. In the 17 days of counter-mopping up, there were 11 battles, killing 32 enemy soldiers below the rank of company commander, capturing 34, and seizing two machine guns and 41 long and short guns. During this counter-mopping up operation, many heroes and models emerged among the Nanhua Party, government, civilian, and military cadres and the masses. Wang Baozhuang, Zhang En (female), and Liu Baozhai of Gangyi District led 37 militiamen, breaking through the enemy's encirclement and suppression several times, always persisting in the work of the district and suppressing the bad elements at any time. Chang Lejin of Ganyuan District fought six enemies in a breakout. Although he was wounded in the head, he still fought the enemies to the death with his fists and finally broke through successfully. Sun Jiesheng, the head of the Civil and Educational Section, He Tao, the director of the Armed Forces Committee, and Hu Hanwen, the Minister of Organization, together with two communicators, maneuvered and fought around the enemy, timely encouraging the masses' morale and investigating the situation, creating the experience of small-scale persistence in the hinterland struggle. Now, all cadres and masses in Nanhua are full of confidence and are ready to strike the enemy at any time and strive for the complete victory of the counter-mopping up.
This newspaper, Jilu Yu, 28th: The Flying Demolition Team of the Border Region Armed Forces Committee General Association set off to the enemy's rear to carry out demolitions. On March 29, upon learning that more than 1,000 enemies from Dongming were "mopping up" in the Juanxi area, the Wu Zong Flying Demolition Team, led by the team's political instructor Wei Xinmin, personally led more than 10 demolition team members to set up landmines at the road the enemy was sure to pass at night. On the 30th, the enemy advanced in several routes towards Gezhuangji, Juancheng. When the enemy's advance troops walked into our minefield, a landmine exploded, and one Chiang Kai-shek soldier was killed on the spot, his body flying. The enemy's follow-up troops were frightened and fled in different directions. At that time, dozens of our militiamen cooperated with the demolition team and fired at the enemy, causing great disorder. On the 6th of this month, another enemy cavalry unit also stepped on a landmine. According to incomplete statistics, there are already hundreds of demolition experts in Juancheng, and they have gained experience in combining demolitions with rifles. After the enemy is blown up, the rifle group can take the opportunity to kill and wound the enemy. If the situation is unfavorable, the rifle group can cover the demolition team's transfer.
