Several Experiences and Understandings
    Yuan Bo
    Our newspaper was founded on May 15th of last year, and it has now been a full year. Over the past year, under the direct leadership of the Central Bureau and with the care and help of the Party, government, military, people, and broad readership throughout the region, it has gradually overcome various difficulties in the early stages of its founding (such as a shortage of manpower and printing materials). In terms of its human and material resources and experience, it can be said that it has laid the foundation for a big step forward. Looking back on the construction process of the newspaper over the past year, we have experienced some tortuous paths, from which we have learned many experiences and lessons. The following points, some of which are new problems encountered in the past year, and some of which have long been known to everyone but are often easily overlooked or difficult to clarify in practical work, are mentioned again without fear of repetition, in order to facilitate improvements in our future work.

    First, the issue of where to stand and where to face. The People's Daily is a newspaper for the entire Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu region, and it should reflect the situation of the entire region and guide the entire region. However, precisely because of this, at the time of its founding, we were limited by the conditions of communication work and lacked a comprehensive understanding of the situation in the entire region. For each region, it seemed to be suspended in the air, and its guidance seemed weak. Later, due to the war, we moved to Taihang, relying on the specific situation in the Taihang area, and then continuously guiding some typical counties and typical examples in the Taiyue, Ji'nan, and Ji-Lu-Yu areas. Gradually, we were able to have a general introduction to the overall picture of the region. By relying on the concrete reports of a region and some typical examples, after several times, it can gradually become a region-wide guidance. This is a concrete example of our learning the combination of the general and the individual.

    In addition, at the time of the founding of our newspaper, because we lived in a newly recovered medium-sized city away from the countryside, and the whole country was in the midst of peace, our reports were briefly obsessed with urban peace construction and the role of external propaganda. Of course, now that we have cities, and our liberated areas have a great influence on the whole country, it is not wrong for us to pay attention to the above reports. In the future, we will have to recover more cities, and we will need to use the deeds of the liberated areas to promote the progress of the whole country even better. In the future, we will need to pay better attention to urban reports and external propaganda, which is no problem. Our mistake at that time was that we paid attention to the cities and did not pay much attention to the vast rural base areas, and we paid attention to external propaganda but not much attention to local work. What was even more inappropriate was that we only paid attention to some "superficial construction" at that time, regardless of the lively movements such as anti-traitors, revenge, and land reform among the broad masses in both cities and the countryside, but the reports were insufficient. It can be determined that external propaganda was also weak. Later, we faced the vast countryside and combined one or two typical cities, especially grasping the central work of our liberated areas to do typical reports, and we quickly established contact with the broad masses (including cities). Regarding the propaganda to the local area and to the whole country, we feel that there are certain differences in the propaganda methods. However, as a local newspaper, the stronger the locality, the stronger the guidance. At the same time, if the best things in this locality can be appropriately used for external propaganda, its external propaganda effect will be greater. This is our understanding of the unity in the difference between internal and external propaganda, and it is also the issue of where our local news work should mainly start from and where it should mainly face.

    Second, the issue of adopting news agency dispatches and maintaining close contact with the broad masses of correspondents. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, our region's news undertakings received the support of the broad masses of soldiers and civilians and their cadres, laying a mass foundation. One of the signs of this was the widespread development of rural communication networks. The work of our region's news agency was also based on the establishment of these communication networks. At the time of the founding of our newspaper, because we had not yet established a newspaper communication network, we completely relied on the Xinhua General Branch and various branches to provide our newspaper with a large amount of news and communications. From the perspective of the timeliness of the news and the breadth of news sources (in terms of regions), it is absolutely necessary for the newspaper to rely on the news agency's dispatches. Newspapers in all countries in the world are like this because news agencies have a set of communication tools (such as radio stations), which are more convenient for specialized news organization. However, the experience of the past year has also proved that it is not enough for a local newspaper to rely solely on the news agency's dispatches. It must earnestly establish a vast rural communication network (including medium and small cities) that is directly connected to the newspaper, and maintain close contact with the broad masses of correspondents at all times. Precisely because the news agency transmits news and communications through radio stations, it has to strive for brevity in the text. As a result, sometimes the actual process of the movement is not described in sufficient detail. The advantage of the manuscripts from local correspondents is not only that they can tell the vivid process of the facts truthfully, but also that they can often communicate and discuss issues, and provide some reference materials, such as work reports and summary booklets, etc. This is of great help to the newspaper editors in understanding the actual situation, and paying attention to this work will enhance the initiative of the newspaper editors and make the implementation of the editorial policy more effective.

    Third, the issue of conscientiously implementing the Party's policies and linking them with reality and the masses. The strength of the newspaper's guidance is determined by the degree of implementation of the Party's policies and the degree of linking them with reality. Every journalist must conscientiously study the Party's policies in order to have a clear mind, distinguish right from wrong, and distinguish between the important and the unimportant. Experience has shown that once the Party's policies are grasped, attention will be paid to combining them with practical situations to conduct investigation and research, and to explore new problems. Comprehensive a large amount of materials in the development of objective reality, improve creativity and experience in work, and then, according to the Party's policies, grasp the main links of the movement, and can effectively promote the development of the movement.

    It is wrong not to pay attention to the study of the Party's policies, to take an objective attitude without using one's brain, to record everything that is heard, and even not to raise news work to the level of political principles, but to limit oneself to technical viewpoints and haggle over typesetting forms. It is also wrong to abstract and dogmatize the Party's policies, not to pay attention to linking them with reality to make concrete and vivid reports, and not to send competent reporters deep into reality to discover problems in the use of force, that is, to focus on internal affairs and neglect external affairs, and only circle around in words. In addition, onesidedly emphasizing linking with reality and linking with the masses, opposing linking with reality to the Party's policies, believing that the Party's policies are only the opinions of a few responsible comrades of the Party committee, and it is better to directly contact the actual situation to meet the requirements of the masses..., thus putting the Party's policies aside, and endlessly searching for phenomena. On the surface, this seems to be a strong spirit of starting from reality and a strong mass viewpoint, but in fact it is a one-sided mass viewpoint. What he can understand in reality is only some one-sided phenomena. He does not understand that the Party's policies are precisely concentrated from the broad masses and a large amount of reality. Experience has also proved that not paying attention to the Party's policies or not linking them with reality to deeply study the Party's policies is the main crux of not running a newspaper well. In this respect, we show some weaknesses today. Only by truly paying attention to the Party's policies can we connect with reality well and comprehensively, and concretely realize and implement the Party's policies to the masses.

    Fourth, improving the political understanding of news cadres and transforming the ideological methods of news workers is one of the basic determining factors in implementing the Party's policies. Because no matter how correct the Party's policies are, they must be realized by news workers. In our practical work, there have been several long-term and unclear disputes, some of which have fallen into unprincipled disputes and sophistry. In fact, every dispute implements an issue of position, viewpoint, and method. Due to the deviation of the position, viewpoint, and method among news workers, even if attention is paid to the study of the Party's policies, there are still different understandings, and it is difficult to concentrate and comprehensively implement the Party's policies. Therefore, it is very important to strengthen the Party's education in the news organs and pay attention to continuously improving news workers from the political and ideological aspects.

    Fifth, regard the news organization as a whole, and do not underestimate the work of the management department. There is no doubt that grasping and embodying the Party's policies is first implemented through the editorial department. However, no matter how good the editing is, if the printing and distribution work is not done well, it will also weaken the political role of the newspaper. Even if the livelihood supply is not done well, it will also affect the editing work. Work has proved that underestimating the work of the management department or only regarding it as technical affairs work not only fails to complete all the tasks of the Party's news workers (it can only be said that one department has been done well), but also often affects the unity between the editorial department and the management department. There is a problem of understanding of the management department here that must be resolved.

　　几点经验与认识
    袁勃
    本报从去年五月十五日创刊，到现在已是整整一年了。一年来，它在中央局直接领导下，在全区党、政、军、民及广大读者的爱护与帮助下，逐步克服了创刊初期的各种困难（如人手少印刷材料缺等），就其人力、物力的条件和经验来讲，可以说都已打下了大步向前发展的基础。回顾一年来本报的建设过程，曾经经历了一些曲折的道路，使我们学得了不少经验和教训。下面的几点意见，有的是一年来遇到的新问题，有的则虽然久已为大家所熟知，但在实际工作中，往往易被忽视，或不易弄清，因之也不怕重复的提出来谈谈，以便于我们今后工作上的改进。
    第一是立足于那里、面向那里的问题。人民日报是晋冀鲁豫全区的报纸，它应当是反映全区的情况并指导全区。但正由于此，在创刊当时，我们限于通讯工作的条件，对于全区情况缺乏全面了解，对各个区来说，似有架在空中之感，显得指导无力。后来我们因战争关系转移到太行，依靠太行区具体情况，再就太岳、冀南、冀鲁豫各个区当中的一些典型县份和典型的事例连续指导，便对全区的面貌，能逐渐有了一般的介绍；而依靠一个地区和一些典型事例的具体的报导，经过几次之后，逐渐又可以成为全区性的指导。这是我们学习一般与个别结合的具体例证。
    另外，在本报创刊当时，由于我们离开乡村住在一个新收复的中等城市，当时全国正在闹和平，因之我们的报导，有短短一个时期曾迷恋于城市和平建设和对外宣传作用。当然，我们现在有了城市，我们解放区对全国又有很大影响，我们注意了如上报导，并不算错，今后我们还要收复更多的城市，还须要更好的用解放区的事迹来推动全国进步，将来还须更好的注意城市报导和对外宣传是没有问题的。我们当时的错误，在于注意了城市，便不大注意广大的农村基本阵地，注意了对外宣传便又不大注意地方工作了。更不妥的是我们当时只注意了一些“表面建设”，而不论城市与农村中，广大群众的反奸复仇土地改革等生动的运动，却报导不足。这样可以断定对外宣传也是无力的。后来我们面向广大农村，并结合一、二典型城市，特别是抓住我们解放区的中心工作做典型报导，我们便很快的和广大群众（连城市在内）有了联系。关于对地方和对全国的宣传，我们觉得在宣传方法上，是有某些区别的。但作为一个地方报纸来讲，地方性越强，指导性就越强，同时倘能把本地方最好的事情，适当做对外宣传，它的对外宣传作用也越大。这是我们对于内外宣传区别中的统一的体会，也是我们的地方新闻工作主要应从那里出发与主要应面向在那里的问题。
    第二、采用通讯社电讯及与广大通讯员保持密切联系的问题。抗日战争中，我区新闻事业得到了广大军民及其干部的支持，奠定了群众性的基础，其标志之一，即是农村通讯网的普遍开展。本区通讯社工作也是依靠于这些通讯网建立起来的。本报创刊当时，由于尚未建立报纸的通讯网，便完全依靠新华总分社与各分社供给本报以大量的新闻与通讯，从新闻时间性的迅速上及新闻来源之广泛上（就地区上说）来看，报纸依靠通讯社的电讯是完全必要的，世界各国的报纸都是如此，这是因为通讯社有一套通讯工具（如电台等），更便于专门组织新闻。但一年来的经验又证明：一个地方报纸，只靠通讯社的电讯供给是不够的，必须认真建立与报纸有直接联系的广大农村通讯网（中、小城市在内），和广大通讯员时时刻刻保持密切的联系。正因为通讯社是通过电台寄递消息和通讯，便不得不力求文字简短，结果有时把实际运动的过程说得不够详尽，而地方通讯员的来稿的好处，不但能把事实的生动过程原原本本的说出来，而且能经常通信商谈问题，并供给一些参考材料。如工作报告及总结性的小册子等，这对于报纸编辑了解实际情况上，帮助很大；重视这一工作，则会使报纸编辑的主动增强，贯彻编辑方针更为有力。
    第三、认真贯彻党的方针政策与联系实际联系群众问题。报纸指导性的强弱，是以贯彻党的方针政策以及与联系实际的程度来决定的。每个新闻工作者必须认真研究党的方针，才能清醒头脑，辨别是非，分别轻重。经验证明：一旦掌握了党的方针，便会随时注意结合实际情况进行调查研究，发掘新的问题。综合客观现实发展中的大量材料，提高工作中的创造与经验，再依据党的方针，掌握运动的主要关节，便可有力的推动运动的发展。
    不注意研究党的方针政策，采取客观态度不花脑筋，有闻必录，甚至不把新闻工作提高到政治原则性上来，而局限于技术观点，斤斤计较排版形式等，是不对的；或者把党的方针抽象化、教条化，不去注意联系实际做具体生动的报导，在力量使用上，不派遣得力记者深入实际去发现问题，即所谓重内勤轻外勤，只在文字上兜圈子，也是不对的；另外片面强调联系实际、联系群众，把联系实际和党的方针对立起来，认为党的方针只是党委机关几个负责同志的意见，不如直接去联系实际更适合于群众要求……，于是把党的方针放在一边，无边际的去搜罗现象，表面上看，这似乎是从实际出发的精神和群众观点很强，实际上是一种片面的群众观点，他所能了解的实际，只是一些片面的现象，他不了解党的方针正是从广泛的群众中与大量的实际中集中起来的。经验中又证明：不重视党的方针或不联系实际来深刻研究党的方针，是办不好报纸的主要症结，而在这一方面，我们今天却表现了一些弱点，只有真正注意党的方针，才能很好的即全面的联系实际，把党的方针政策具体的实现并贯彻到群众中去。
    第四、提高新闻干部的政治认识，并改造新闻工作者的思想方法，在贯彻党的方针上，乃是基本的决定因素之一。因为不论党的方针如何正确，总是要新闻工作者来实现的。在我们的实际工作中，曾经有过若干长期纠葛不清的论争，有的便陷于无原则的纠纷与诡辩中了。实际上每一个论争，都贯彻着一个立场观点方法的问题，由于新闻工作者中间的立场观点方法有了偏差，即使是注意研究党的方针，也还是各有各的不同理解，很难集中的全面的贯彻党的方针，因之，在新闻机关中加强党的教育，注意从政治上、思想上把新闻工作者不断的加以提高，乃是十分重要的。
    第五、把新闻机关视为一个整体的机构，不能轻视经理部门工作。毫无疑问的，掌握与体现党的方针，首先是通过编辑部门来执行；但不论编辑的如何好，如果印刷和发行工作做不好，同样是会削弱报纸的政治作用，即使是生活供给有一点搞不好，也会影响到编辑工作。工作中证明：轻视经理部门的工作或者只把它看成技术性的事务工作，这不仅不能使党的新闻工作者的任务全部完成（只能说是做好了一部门），而且经常影响着编辑部门与经理部门的团结，这里存在着一个对经理部门的认识问题必须加以解决。
