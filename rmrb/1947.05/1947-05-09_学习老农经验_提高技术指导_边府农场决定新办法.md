Learning from Veteran Farmers' Experience, Improving Technical Guidance
Bianfu Farm Decides on New Measures

[This newspaper Changzhi dispatch] In order to make agricultural technical guidance more practical, Bianfu Farm has made the following decisions: (1) Designate key villages, starting with the promotion of improved varieties (including sugar beets, seed salt... promoting Yuanhang eggs, Berkshire pigs, etc.). (2) Send dedicated personnel to the fields of Liu Jubao, a skilled seed cultivator, at any time to study his cultivation methods and further improve his seed selection techniques. Invite Zhang Haixing, an experienced indigo dyer, to the farm to gradually study his seed salt and indigo dyeing processes. (3) Collect and study local methods for preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests. Contact medical institutions to jointly study local methods for preventing and treating livestock diseases, collect medicinal plants, and try planting and using them on the farm. To ensure that the research work achieves tangible results, this year's experimental work will focus on the prevention and control of livestock plague, the cultivation of indigo, sugar beets, and tobacco leaves, and the breeding of grains and wheat, with particular emphasis on indigo as the experimental focus, and further research into the chemical processes of indigo dyeing.

　　学习老农经验  提高技术指导
    边府农场决定新办法
    【本报长治讯】为使农业技术指导更加切合实际，边府农场特作如下决定：（一）划定基点村，从推广优良品种中（包括甜菜、种盐……推广远航鸡蛋、巴克夏夏猪等）。（二）派专人随时到育种能手刘聚保的田园去，研究他的耕作方法，把他的选种技术提高一步。邀请打靛老手张海兴到农场来，把他的种盐、打靛过程逐步加以研究。（三）搜集研究防治病虫、害虫的土办法。联系医务机关，共同研究当地防治畜病的土办法，采集药用植物，在农场内试种试用。为使研究工作获得确实成效，确定今年试验工作，以畜瘟的防治，蓝靛、甜菜、烟叶的栽培，和谷麦的育种为主，尤以蓝靛为试验重心，并进一步钻研打靛的化学过程。
