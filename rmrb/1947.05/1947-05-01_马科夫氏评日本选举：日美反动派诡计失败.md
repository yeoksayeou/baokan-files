　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th: TASS, Moscow dispatch: Markov recently published an article in Pravda analyzing the situation of the Japanese parliamentary election, stating briefly: The Japanese reactionary parties represented by the "Liberal" Party and the "Democratic" Party understand that the voters represented by the democratic forces must be stronger than in the 1946 election, so they have harmed the democratic parties in every possible way. However, in the past year, the strength of the democratic camp has increased, and the ranks have expanded. The revision of the election law by the parliament (note: that is, the restoration of the so-called "medium-sized" constituency system that was abolished in 1945) is a conspiracy of the reactionaries, nothing more than to make the democratic forces encounter more difficulties in the election struggle. They divided the country into many constituencies to disperse the votes of the democratic parties. The dissolution of the "Progressive" Party and the organization of the "Democratic" Party is another conspiracy of the Japanese reactionaries. Their intention is obviously to use the signboard of "democracy" to deceive the public. The Yoshida government has been trying its best to help these reactionaries in the election campaign. Deliberately delaying the purge work is one way of providing this help. Although the Japanese government has recently had to deny many well-known "Democratic" Party representatives and some "Liberal" Party leaders, these parties still rely on many people who should have been purged but still enjoy complete freedom to carry out various political conspiracies. They not only manipulate elections, but even act as candidates. The first name on the "Liberal" Party's candidate list is Yoshida Shigeru, the pillar of the Japanese reactionaries, who is closely related to the Japanese imperialist foreign policy. His candidacy should have been stripped long ago, but the Americans regarded him as a "convenient" role. These Americans are trying to hold on to the control of Japan and use Japan as a tool for their expansionist policy. The Japanese reactionaries, in coordination with their shameless slander offensive against democratic groups, also adopted terrorist means to oppose the Communist Party's candidates and campaign propagandists, stole slogans introducing the Communist Party's parliamentary candidates, and engaged in bribery (the reactionaries allocated 300 million yuan for election activities). No matter how many difficulties there are in the struggle, the democratic parties—as in the elections of local administrative organs—finally shattered the reactionaries' expectation of "complete victory."

　　马科夫氏评日本选举：日美反动派诡计失败
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：马科夫顷于真理报著文分析日本议会选举的情势，略称：以“自由”党、“民主”党为代表的日本反动党派明白民主势力所代表的选民必定比一九四六年选举时更为强大，因而对民主党派百般加害。可是在过去一年中，民主阵营的力量增强了，行列扩大了。议会之修改选举法，（按：即恢复曾于一九四五年废除了的所谓“中型”选区制。）乃是反动派的诡计，无非想使民主势力在选举斗争中遭遇到更多的困难。他们把国内划成许多选区，以分散民主党派的选票。解散“进步”党，组织“民主”党，是日本反动派另一种诡计。其企图显然是在利用“民主”的招牌，以欺骗大众。吉田政府在选举运动中，对于这些反动派是竭力帮助的。故意迟延整肃工作便是这种帮助的方式之一。尽管日本政府最近不得不否认许多有名的“民主”党代表和一些“自由”党的领袖，然而这些政党迄今仍然依赖许多应该清除却依然享有完全自由的人们，进行各种各样的政治阴谋，他们不仅操纵选举，甚至充当候选人。“自由”党候选人名单中的第一名就是日本反动派的支柱吉田茂，他是和日本帝国主义外交政策有密切关系的人物。他的候选人资格早就应该被剥夺的，然而美国人竟把他看作“方便”的脚色，这些美国人企图紧握着对日管制，并利用日本作为他们实行扩张政策的工具。日本反动派，配合着他们无耻诽谤民主团体的攻势，并采取恐怖手段以反对共产党的候选人和竞选宣传者，偷走介绍共产党议员候选人的标语牌，以及进行贿选（反动派拨出三万万元作选举活动费）。不管在斗争中有多少困难，民主的党派——在地方行政机关的选举中也是如此——终于粉碎了反动派对于“完全胜利”的期望。
