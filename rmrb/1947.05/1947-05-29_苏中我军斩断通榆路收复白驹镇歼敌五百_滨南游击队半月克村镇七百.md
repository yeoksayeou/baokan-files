Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 27th: A unit of the Suzhong People's Liberation Army, at 11:00 AM on the 23rd, recovered the important town of Baiju on the Dongtai-Yancheng section of the Tongyu Highway in one fell swoop, completely annihilating the defending enemy, Hao Pengju's Fourth Division, 11th Regiment, two companies, and the armed forces of the Seven Tian Chiang-affiliated rural regime, capturing over 310 people including Deputy Regiment Commander Song Lixun, killing and wounding dozens, and seizing over ten light machine guns, one grenade launcher and small cannon, over 200 rifles, and over ten pistols. The main transportation artery of the Chiang army in Suzhong and Subei was thus cut off. Currently, the People's Liberation Army is expanding its victories along this line to the north and south. To coordinate with this battle, a unit of the Suzhong Second Military Sub-district local armed forces ambushed the remnants of Hao's forces who invaded from Liuzhuang at the Dongxi River Bridge in Xinghua on the 22nd, killing and capturing 120 people including their regiment commander, Wu Yutian. On the same day, the Ninth Military Sub-district local armed forces ambushed the local Chiang's puppet troops near Yuxi Town, Nantong, in places like Sijia Town and Erjia Town, capturing and killing over 90 Chiang-affiliated joint defense battalion commanders and others, seizing seven light machine guns, four Thompson and carbine guns, and forty rifles.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 27th: New changes have taken place in the Binnan situation. In order to coordinate with the Luzhong campaign, the People's Local Armed Forces took advantage of the enemy's Seventh Division and Forty-eighth Division being forced to move north, actively launching attacks. In the past half month, they launched more than 30 attacks, killing and capturing more than 200 enemy main forces and local armed forces, capturing more than 300 puppet township chiefs and others alive, destroying 20 puppet district and township public offices, seizing 120 long and short guns, more than 4,000 rounds of ammunition, one hand cannon, five warhorses, and many other military supplies, and recovering more than 700 villages and towns. The masses have returned home one after another, rural order is gradually stabilizing, market towns are opening, and prices have fallen by one to three times. The "Returning Home Corps" are increasingly panicked and shaken.
