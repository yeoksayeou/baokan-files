　　Bian District Postal Service Headquarters Decides to Fully Improve Postal Speed

    [Our Newspaper] The Bian District Postal Service Headquarters has decided to concentrate all its efforts to launch a region-wide speed improvement campaign in June to support the front lines and accelerate the delivery of letters. The general goal is: to strive for every possible minute, to improve speed one step further on the existing basis, and to strive for speed, accuracy, regularity, and universality.” To this end, the following has been decided: 1. Adjust the connection time of postal routes, overcome the disconnection phenomena at the junctions of districts, day and night shifts, half-day and daily shifts, trunk lines and branch lines, etc., and strive for flexible coordination and connection of schedules. 2. Exert strength to carry enough and walk enough, vigorously overcome backlog, familiarize ourselves with the location of the border area, send quickly and accurately, widely explain to the publishing institutions, and strive to pack books and newspapers tightly and write clearly, so as to avoid loosening and breaking in the middle, which may cause delays back and forth. 3. Strengthen military mail and persist in liaison with guerrilla areas, assign strong tool personnel and leading cadres to military mail, and always ensure close contact between the front and rear, and ensure that it cannot be broken or dropped. Night shifts have now been implemented in Taihang and Taiyue. In addition to preparing for night shifts, Ji'nan is also actively trying to add "express shifts" and motorcycle tools to improve speed. Ji'LuYu is also actively preparing for night shifts.
