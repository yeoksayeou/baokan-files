　　Women's Production Self-Sufficiency Model
    Refugee Wang Liqin Earns Money Through Transportation
    [Our Newspaper, Bo'ai News] Wang Liqin, in her thirties, is the chairman of the Women's Rescue Association of Five Streets, Zone One, Bo'ai. After the Chiang Kai-shek/puppet traitorous army invaded Bo'ai, she settled down following our army's withdrawal. Under the democratic government's loan relief and the slogan of "Self-sufficiency in production leads to wealth and returning home!" she intensified her transportation efforts. Initially, she had only 40,000 yuan in funds. At the end of last year, after accounting, she had a net profit of 62,000 yuan. Feeling that the capital was small and she wasn't earning much money, she freely combined with five other shareholders in February of this year, with a total share capital of 266,000 yuan in silver dollars. With a larger capital, her enthusiasm for production became even higher. She often carried her backpack, regardless of wind or rain, and ran around for production.
    She bought sulfur from Zone Seven of Bo'ai and sold it in Changzhi City. She brought back hemp and nails as return cargo, running three trips and selling a total of 2,600 jin of sulfur. After increasing the fund, she earned a profit of 320,000 yuan in just one month.
    She was also very prompt in accounting and distributing dividends. She distributed dividends after each trip. Besides the transportation costs, she distributed the earned dividends to everyone according to the amount of their shares. Currently, each 10,000 yuan share has received more than 10,000 yuan in dividends. According to the regulations on labor-capital cooperation, she should also receive a "two-eight" bonus in addition to the dividends, but she refused, saying, "I am producing for everyone, just to give everyone a way to make a living. It's fine for me to just distribute dividends according to the shares!"
    During the long journey of production, she was also very frugal. After earning money, she wanted to support the front lines and defeat the Chiang Kai-shek bandits to recover northern Henan as soon as possible. First, she offered 5,000 yuan to comfort the front-line militia. Under her influence, some gave 1,000 yuan, others 2,000 yuan, totaling more than 20,000 yuan in consolation money. When she delivered the consolation money to the front-line district office, she also entertained the sick and wounded militia at the front, giving the militia money to spend.
    This year, when electing production models, she was selected as a self-sufficiency expert in Bo'ai. After being commended, her enthusiasm was even higher. She is now preparing to buy bamboo goods and go to the mountains to sell them, earning more money and returning home with wealth.

　　妇女生产自给模范
    难民王立勤运输赚钱
    【本报博爱讯】三十来岁的王立勤，是博爱一区五街的妇救会主席，从蒋伪卖国军侵犯博爱后，随着我军撤出安了家，在民主政府的贷款救济与“生产自给发财还家！”的口号下，加劲的搞起运输。起初只有四万元基金，去年年底算了账，净赚红利六万二千元。她嫌本钱少，赚不多钱，便于本年二月自由结合了五股，共股金洋廿六万六千元，股本大了，她生产的劲头也更高了，经常背了背包，不顾风雨，奔跑生产。
    她从博爱七区买上硫磺，到长治市去卖。回货捎麻和钉子，跑了三次共贩卖硫磺二千六百斤。自增基金后一个月即赚红利三十二万元。
    她算账分红还很及时，每跑一次就要分红利一次，把赚下的红利，除了脚价花费外，按股金的多少分给大家红利，现每万元股已分得红利一万元多了。本来在劳资合作的规定上，她除得红利外还应“二、八”提奖，但她拒绝，她说：“我给大家生产，就是叫大家都有办法，我光按股分红就行了！”
    她在生产的长途中，还很节约、赚了钱还要支援前线，早日打败蒋贼收复豫北，首先慰劳前线民兵五千元。在她的影响下，你一千他二千，就慰劳了两万多元。他把慰劳款送到前方区公所时，并招待前方的病号和挂彩的民兵，给民兵钱花。
    今年选举生产模范时，她被选为博爱的生产自给能手，当表扬她后，情绪更高涨，现准备去买竹货，上山去卖，赚更多的钱，发财还家。
