　　Two Approaches, Two Different Results
    The Experience of Yuanqu in Mobilizing the Masses to Subscribe to Household Plans
    [Report from Shexian by Our Newspaper] After the great production movement started in Yuanqu Village, Fifth District, the leadership went deep into the masses to inspire them to formulate plans for prosperity. The first time they helped labor hero Yao Huozhu make a plan, they used a rigid calculation method. When they arrived at his house, they immediately asked, "Let's calculate how much you can cultivate and how much you can save." Huozhu said impatiently, "Okay, okay! It's always like this every year." They asked a question and got an answer, wasting half a day. They calculated that the whole family could cultivate two and save one this year. Yao Huozhu said, "I cultivated two and saved one last year, and this year it's still two and one. That's it." After discussion among the comrades, they realized that this method did not inspire the masses' enthusiasm for production, but instead caused resentment. Then, they used a second calculation method for Yao Huozhu. After understanding his family's situation, they used the method of "first finding the holes, then patching the seams and calculating the time." Seeing that Huozhu's house was very dilapidated, they immediately said, "Your house is very dilapidated, it needs repair." Huozhu said, "That's right, I plan to use 25,000 yuan earned from mutual aid labor to buy some wood and stone to repair it, and I also want to invest 20,000 yuan in the mutual aid group as shares." "You said you would use 45,000 yuan for repairing the house and buying shares, but eating and drinking for your family is a big deal." Huozhu said, "Speaking of eating and drinking, my family has two people, and the whole year's food, clothing, public grain, and pocket money will cost more than 1,000 catties of rice." "With such large expenses and such big holes, what will you use to fill them?" Yao Huozhu said, "Our mutual aid group plans to rent an acre of paddy field from someone else and plant it all with tobacco. My own dry land in Lujiagang will be planted with flowers on seven-tenths of an acre. In addition to farming, I can also spare more than ten days to transport goods and do odd jobs, earning at least 20,000 yuan. Also, I'll have my mother spin and weave, and she can sell half of it after making clothes for ourselves in three months..." Through casual conversation, they drew up a family plan. The whole family of two, cultivating three and a half acres of dry land and working fifteen days on slope land, would have a total annual income of 1,996 catties of millet and 54,000 yuan. The whole year's food, clothing, public grain, and house repairs would cost a total of 1,392 catties of millet and 45,000 yuan, leaving a net surplus of 604 catties of millet and 9,000 yuan. He said happily, "If you put it that way, I have to work hard." Yao Yinyuan, who was participating in the calculation nearby, also chimed in, "We have to hurry up and get that acre of land we rented for our mutual aid group, and we'll all guarantee to help you make bricks for your house." This way of calculation increased his enthusiasm. The next day, when they were working on his land, they began calculating for Yinyuan. Now his whole group has finished sowing the slope land and weeding the wheat fields, and they are now rushing to deliver manure.

　　两种做法两样效果
    原曲动员群众订按家计划经验
    【本报涉县讯】五区原曲村大生产运动起来后，领导上便深入群众启发订发家计划，第一次给劳动英雄姚火柱订计划时，采用了呆板的只计算办法，到他家首先便提出咱给你算算看能够耕几余几，火柱很不奈烦的说：“可以吧！年年总要这样弄一回哩。”问一声答一声，误了整整半天，算出全家今年能做到耕二余一，姚火柱说：“俺去年就是耕二余一，今年还是耕二余一，就这吧。”经过工作同志大家伙的研究，这样办法并不能启发群众生产积极性，反而会招到反感。接着便对姚火柱来了个第二次计算，了解他家的情况后，用先找窟窿后补补绽打算时光的办法，进门看到火柱房子很破，即说：“你的房子很破，该修修哩。”火柱说：“你说那吧，俺今年就打算用互助里的工拿上两万五千元买些木石收拾收拾哩，另外还想往俺互助组入两万块钱股金哩。”“你说的修房子入股金就用四万五千块钱，你家的吃喝可是个大事哩。”火柱说：“提起吃喝来，俺家有两口人，全年连吃带穿上公粮零花等，就得一千多斤米哩。”“像你家这大开支这大窟窿拿啥来补呢？”姚火柱说：“俺互助里打算租上人家一亩水地，都栽成烟，俺自己芦家岗旱地七分种成花，除种田地外，还有十多天抽空去运输打忙工，至少也能挣两万元，另外叫俺娘纺织，三个月除了自己穿还能卖一半……。”由闲拉扯当中，订出全家计划，全家两口人，种着旱地三亩一分五，坡地十五个工，全年农副共收入小米一千九百九十六斤，钱五万四千元。全年吃穿上公粮及修理房子等，共用小米一千三百九十二斤，洋四万五千元，净余小米六百零四斤，洋九千元。他很高兴的说：“要照你这样说吧，还得好好干哩。”在旁边参加打算的姚银元也抢着说：“咱互助里租人家那一亩地还得赶紧去弄哩，你盖房子俺大家保证给你张坯。”经过这样打算，提高了他的积极性。第二天到他地做活时，又给银元打算起来，现在他全组坡地下种，麦地锄苗都已完成了，现在正在突击送粪中。（胜前、兴华、贵昌、学俭、华峰、士元）
