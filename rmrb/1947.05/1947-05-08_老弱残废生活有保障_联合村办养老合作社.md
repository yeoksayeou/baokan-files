Guaranteed Life for the Old, Weak, Disabled, and Ill
Joint Village-Run Home for the Aged Cooperative
[This report from Cixian] During the land leveling and consolidation movement in Lianhe Village, Pengcheng Township, Cixian County, a number of elderly, weak, disabled, and ill military dependents without support were discovered. Among them were seven households, including blind individuals and wives without labor power. Their children had all joined the Eighth Route Army before 1942 and made significant contributions to the people. Now they are fighting the traitor Chiang Kai-shek on various fronts. The masses are very concerned about their families, saying, "Their children are shedding blood outside for us, shouldn't we support them!" During this struggle to distribute the fruits of victory, they were all listed as first-class military dependents. Many elderly people said at the meeting, "They should get more things, how could we have turned ourselves around if it weren't for the Eighth Route Army!"
　　Although they were entitled to a considerable share of the fruits of victory, they were mostly disabled people with poor eyesight and a lack of labor power, left only to sit and eat away at their shares. District Chief Zhu convened village cadres and activists to study the living problems of these people. Everyone unanimously agreed that if a thorough solution was not found for them, their fruits of victory would probably be exhausted in less than half a year, and what would they do in the winter? This issue sparked heated discussions. Finally, it was decided to establish a home for the aged cooperative, using the 400,000 yuan worth of fruits of victory that these seven helpless military dependents were entitled to as the cooperative's capital. In addition, a shop was set aside for the cooperative. Progressive merchants in the village who were willing to serve the masses were selected to be responsible for operating the shop, selling various goods needed by the masses. A business plan was drawn up to ensure that no luxury goods were sold, and through careful management and thrift, a certain profit would be guaranteed to provide for these disabled military dependents until they grew old. In terms of living provisions, it was decided to issue 25 liang of grain per person per day and 100 yuan for food per person per day (65 yuan for food, 35 yuan for charcoal). Each person would receive five zhang of cloth and three jin of cotton for clothing each year. The cooperative would be responsible for the cost of medicine for ordinary illnesses, and the cooperative would be responsible for burial after death, with a burial fee of 50,000 yuan per person. They planned very carefully for the military dependents, and also stipulated that if a military dependent died and it was discovered that there were other helpless disabled military dependents or masses, the membership of the deceased members could be supplemented after discussion and approval by the masses.
　　Now the cooperative has delivered grain, food money, and single-layer clothing cloth to them separately, and the military dependents are extremely happy! Holding the things sent by the cooperative, the blind man smiled so much that his eyes appeared very small, and he touched the cooperative cadre with a beaming smile, saying, "For the first time, I have never experienced such a thing in my life. The cooperative cares about me even more than my children. If it weren't for Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, who would care about us, the blind and incompetent?" Guo Youfu said, "This is truly preferential treatment for military dependents. Chairman Mao is really our savior, and we will never forget Chairman Mao and the Communist Party even after death!" Comrade Li Lianfu, a veteran who was honorably discharged after being wounded, had his eyes damaged two years ago. When he saw how concerned the cooperative was about these people, he was moved and said to everyone, "Although I didn't join the home for the aged cooperative, I am willing to lend the medicine rack I received to the cooperative for use." He became even more excited and patted his chest loudly, saying, "From now on, I won't be afraid of anything. If my eyes go blind, someone will take care of me." (Jian Feng)

　　老弱残废生活有保障
    联合村办养老合作社
    【本报磁县讯】联合村是磁县彭城镇的一个村子，这次填平补齐运动中，发现了一批没有依靠的老弱残废军属；这里有瞎子和无劳力的老婆等七户，他们的孩子们都是四二年以前参加了八路军的老战士，为人民立下了不少功劳，现在都正在各个战线上与卖国贼蒋介石作最后斗争。群众对他们的家属非常关心，说：“人家孩子在外拚命流血，还不是为咱，咱就该拥护人家！”在这次分配斗争果实时，把他们都列在头等军属内，有很多上年纪的老人，在开会时说：“人家就该多分些东西，要不是八路军咱们怎能翻了身！”
    他们应分的果实虽然不少，但都是些没眼睛缺劳力的残废人，只有拿着果实坐着白吃。朱区长召集村干部和积极分子，研究这些人生活问题，大家一致认为如不给他们想个彻底办法，恐怕不到半年就将果实消耗光了，到了冬天如何办？这一问题引起了大家热烈的讨论，最后决定成立养老合作社，把这七个无依无靠的军属应分的四十万元果实作为养老合作社资金；另外还留下一座店房亦归了合作社，由村内抽出愿意为群众服务比较进步的商人，负责经营，销售群众所需要的各种物品；并订出营业计划，保证不卖奢侈品，并在节衣缩食的细心经营下，保证要赚到一定利润，供给这些残废军属白头到老。在生活供给上，决定每人每天发粮食二十五两，每人每天发给菜金一百元（菜钱六十五元，炭钱三十五元）。每人每年发给衣服布五丈，棉花三斤，平常生病吃药，药价由合作社负责，死亡后由合作负责葬埋，每人规定葬埋费五万元。他们为军属打算的很周到，还规定：如军属死亡，而发现再有无依无靠的残废军属或群众，经群众讨论批准后，可以补充死亡之社员名额。
    现在已把粮食、菜金、单衣布等由合作社按户分别送给他们了，军属们可高兴极啦！拿着合作社送来的东西，把瞎眼笑得显得很微小，笑眯眯的摸着合作社干部说：“头一回，我一辈子没有经过这样的事，合作社比俺孩子还关心我，要不是毛主席共产党，俺这些少眼无能的人谁管呢？”郭有富说：“这才真是优待军属的，毛主席真是咱们的救命恩人，就是死后亦忘不了毛主席共产党！”荣誉军人李连付同志，他是光荣负伤退伍的，前年眼坏了，他见到合作社对这些人这样关心，感动得向大家说：“我虽然没有参加养老合作社，但我情愿把我分到的药架子借给合作社使用”。他越发兴奋了，拍着自己的胸膛大声说：“这以后我可啥也不怕了，我的眼如瞎了，有人照管了。”（简峰）
