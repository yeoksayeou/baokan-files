Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 27th—The Tonghai Guerrilla Unit, which persists between Nantong and Haimen, has repeatedly performed extraordinary feats in extremely difficult circumstances. In an area of 50 li east to west and 30 li north to south, Chiang's army built 51 strongholds, used 13 large rivers and 5 highways to blockade them, and repeatedly "mopped up" for five and a half months, but the unit still stood firm. On February 25th, Chiang's army attacked fiercely from more than ten directions. The guerrillas used bamboo poles to vault over the sea, moving as swiftly as flying, leaving Chiang's army chasing shadows everywhere. However, on the same day, the unit suddenly appeared at the foot of Qianlang Mountain and completely wiped out the Chiang's township government of Changqiao Township. A certain hated Chiang's head of the Bao in Chuangang stronghold also suddenly disappeared in the middle of the night. The next day, a notice from the People's Liberation Army Guerrilla Unit appeared in Chuangang, shocking the Chiang's puppets, who dared not move for several days. A few days ago, after the guerrillas arrested eleven Chiang's puppet "Self-Defense Force" members at the Sanxu head stronghold, ten li away from Nantong City, they left safely. On another occasion, four guerrillas chased and arrested eighteen Chiang's puppet "Self-Defense Force" members, and were surrounded by more than eighty Chiang's soldiers from the Chuangang, Zhanglanshan, and Sanhe Town strongholds. The four guerrillas resisted from all sides and held out until nightfall, when the Chiang's army finally retreated to the strongholds.
Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 29th—The Jiang (du) Gao (you) local armed forces of the Second Sub-district of Jiangsu and Anhui, after penetrating behind Chiang, successively recovered Guanba, 20 li south of Lin (ze), and Xiaoji Town (15 li southeast of Fanchuan) in Jiangdu on April 21st and 22nd, seizing three machine guns and more than twenty rifles. Xiaoji Town is a commercial transportation hub between Fanchuan, Dashe, and Dazhou, and is the first major town recovered by the local armed forces after penetrating behind Chiang in Jiangdu.

　　通海武工队屡创蒋伪军
    【新华社华中二十七日电】坚持在南通、海门间的通海武工队，在极艰苦环境中屡创奇功。该地东西五十里，南北三十里，蒋军筑下五十一个据点，利用十三条大河与五条公路封锁他们，反复“清剿”达五个半月，该队仍屹立其间。二月二十五日，蒋军十余路猛扑，该队战士以竹竿跳远过海，来去如飞，蒋军到处扑空，而该队当日却突然出现千狼山脚下，将长桥乡蒋记乡公所全部解决。川港据点为人民痛恨的蒋记某保长，亦突于半夜失踪。次日，川港出现人民解放军游击队的布告，使蒋伪震惊，数日不敢出动。日前武工队在离南通城十里之三圩头据点逮捕十一名蒋伪“自卫队”员后，安然离去，又一次，武工队员四人为追捕十八个蒋伪“自卫队”员，被川港、张兰山、三和镇三据点出援之蒋军八十余人包围，四个队员四面阻击，坚持天晚，蒋军终于缩回据点。
    【新华社华中二十九日电】苏皖二分区江（都）高（邮）地方武装突入蒋后，于四月二十一、二十二两日，先后复收临（泽）南二十里之官坝及江都小纪镇（樊川东南十五里），缴机枪三挺，步枪二十余支。按小纪镇为樊川、大舍、大舟间商业交通联络点，为该地方武装突入江都蒋后收复的第一个重镇。
