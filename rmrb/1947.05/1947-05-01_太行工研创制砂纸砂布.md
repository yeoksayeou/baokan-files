The Taihang Industrial Research Institute has been researching sandpaper and abrasive cloth since the end of last year. First, fish glue was used, then water-based glue, and finally a mixture of the two, but none worked. Now, a mixture of half pigskin glue and half water-based glue is used, which adheres very firmly. When rubbed against imported Tiger brand abrasive cloth and No. 40 coarse sandpaper, the imported sandpaper can be rubbed off, while the homemade sandpaper has very little shedding. From now on, the base areas will no longer need to buy imported sandpaper and abrasive cloth. (Changzhi City Trade Union Communications Group)

　　太行工研创制砂纸砂布
    太行工业研究所，自去年底研究砂纸砂布。先用鱼票，后用水胶，最后二者混合用，但都不行，现用猪皮胶水胶各半，粘的非常牢固，与外来的虎牌砂线及四十号粗砂纸相摩，可将外货的砂擦掉，而自制砂纸脱落极少，从此根据地可不买外来的砂纸砂布了。（长市工会通讯小组）
