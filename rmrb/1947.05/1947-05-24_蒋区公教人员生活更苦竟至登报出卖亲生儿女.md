Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: According to reports from Shanghai newspapers: The suffering of public educators in Chiang Kai-shek-controlled areas has surpassed any previous period. A professor at a university in Shanghai, unable to make a living, wrote to Wenhui Daily requesting that his son be accepted as an apprentice in the newspaper's printing plant. A teacher at Gezhi Middle School in Shanghai sustains his lunch with only three fried dough cakes. Teachers at the No. 1 Central National School in Hanyang have not been paid for two or three months, even to the point of running out of food. Yu Zhiqin, a teacher at a private elementary school in Hangzhou, has a family of five whose combined monthly salary is only 200,000 yuan. They are forced to have their eldest son sell newspapers on the street every day, but they still cannot make a living. A minor civil servant in Gong County, Sichuan, due to insufficient income, sets up a fortune-telling stall at night to make ends meet, but was "dismissed" for "undermining the government's prestige" when discovered by his supervisor. A civil servant couple in Wuxi, due to low salaries, wrote to the Shanghai Xinmin Evening News, requesting to be introduced as hired laborers to maintain their livelihood. On the streets of Hankou, a middle school teacher even publicly advertised the sale of his own daughter. A civil servant in Xiangxiang, Hunan, due to unemployment, advertised in the newspaper to sell his two boys, aged five and nine.
