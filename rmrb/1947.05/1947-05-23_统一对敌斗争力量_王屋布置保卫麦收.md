　　Unify the Forces of Struggle Against the Enemy
    Wangwu Deploys to Defend the Wheat Harvest
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 21st] Wangwu County convened an expanded cadre meeting on the 8th of this month, calling on cadres in the border areas to learn the complete set of skills for leading the masses in production and fighting against the enemy, and to prepare for armed defense of the wheat harvest. The organizational form of combining labor and military was determined as follows: (1) The joint defense villages will organize an armed production command, with administrative villages as the unit, to organize small commands, and cadres from all systems will lead in a unified manner. (2) The militia in the villages bordering the enemy can stay in their own villages, guarding and covering the masses in rushing to plant and harvest; the rotating militia in the rear will specialize in monitoring and attacking the enemy in front. (3) Strengthen intelligence and anti-traitor organizations to closely monitor the enemy's situation.
