　　Eighty Thousand Liberated Peasants in the Border Region Join the Main Force to Prepare for Counter-Offensive

　　[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] During the victorious spring offensive across the region, another 80,000 liberated peasants in the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region joined the People's Liberation Army. This astonishing achievement exceeded the overall regional target by more than one-third. Specifically, 30,000 from the Taihang Region (originally targeted at 13,000), 26,000 from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region, 18,000 from southern Hebei (originally targeted at 13,000), and 6,000 from the Taiyue Region. According to Generals Liu and Deng of the ever-victorious People's Liberation Army, these new soldiers are of very high quality and extremely enthusiastic about learning how to kill the enemy. None of them deserted after arriving at the front lines. They believe that the reason these new soldiers are better each time is that the land reform movement across the region is becoming more thorough with each passing day. Therefore, Generals Liu and Deng affirmed: "With such an ample source of manpower and such high-quality soldiers, we have every reason to guarantee that we can win even greater victories and eliminate even more enemies."

　　[Dispatch from the Yubei Front Lines, 19th of this month, from this Newspaper] Reporter Wu Xiang reports: Under the slogan of fully preparing for the great counter-offensive, more than a thousand new soldiers and liberated soldiers have flooded into the main corps of the "Plow Characters" [耕字] troops. The new soldiers are all liberated peasants and militiamen with very high political quality. They brought to each platoon and squad the vivid scenes of enthusiastic support for the army from the masses and mutual aid in production after the equalization, enabling the troops to further appreciate the infinite and powerful support from the rear, thereby further increasing their confidence in victory. Zheng Guichu from Wangjia'an, north of Lincheng, said, "In our small village, six people signed up to join the army on the spot in one night." A comrade in the squad asked him, "Do you miss home since you just arrived?" He said, "The village cadres are taking care of things at home, even better than if I were there myself, so why would I miss it?" The liberated soldiers who joined the unit, formerly belonging to the 59th Regiment of the 66th Division and the 379th Regiment of the 47th Division of the Chiang army, have all recognized after a short period of education and grievances that there is no way out for the Chinese people unless Chiang's bandit regime is ended. If they run home, they will still be conscripted by the Kuomintang, so the only way is to pick up a gun and fight Lao Jiang. The veteran soldiers take great care of the new and liberated soldiers. The blackboard bulletins are filled with articles welcoming the new soldiers, and the new and liberated soldiers have also set up merit plans, ready to show their skills in the next battle.

　　边区八万翻身农民参加主力准备反攻
    【本报特讯】在全区胜利的春季攻势中，晋冀鲁豫区又有八万翻身农民参加人民解放军。这一惊人成绩，超过了全区预定计划总数三分之一强。计太行区三万人（原定一万三千人），冀鲁豫两万六千人，冀南一万八千人（原定一万三千人），太岳六千人。据人民解放军常胜军刘邓两将军谈：这些新战士质量非常之好，学习杀敌情绪非常之高。他们抵达前方后，根本没有一个开小差的。他们认为：这些新战士之所以一次比一次好，是由于全区土地改革运动一次比一次走向了深入。因此刘邓两将军肯定的说：“我们有了这样充足的兵源，有了质量这样好的战士，我们有充分理由保证：一定可以打更大的胜仗，消灭更多的敌人。”

    【本报豫北前线十九日电】本报记者吴象报导：在全力准备大反攻的口号下，又有千余新战士、及被解放的战士涌进耕字部队之主力兵团。新战士均系翻身农民和民兵，政治质量极高。把填平补齐后群众热烈拥军，生产互助的生动情景带到各排各班，使部队进一步体会到后方对前线无穷尽的强有力的支援，胜利信心更加提高。临城北王家庵的郑贵初说：“我们一个小村，一晚上就有六个人当场报名参军。”班里同志问他：“刚来想家吗？”他说：“家有村干部照应，比自己在家还好哩，想他干啥？”参加该部之被解放战士，原属蒋军六六师五九团与四七师三七九团，经过短期教育与诉苦，均已认清不结束蒋贼统治，中国人民就没有出路，跑回家还要被国民党抓壮丁，只有拿起枪来和老蒋拚。老战士对新战士和解放战士照顾备至，门板报贴满了欢迎新战士的稿子，新战士、解放战士亦纷纷订立功计划，准备在下次战役中大显身手。
