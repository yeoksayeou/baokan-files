Comrades, listen to me,
I want to talk about fearing to get rich:
Fearing struggle, fearing to get rich,
He's afraid the village will count him.
There was an old man Zhao in Huguan,
He was afraid of the land investigation movement;
He was just afraid they'd cut off his tail.
Starting a family through labor without struggle,
In winter, he only eats plain bread.
He sold a day's work for a stone of wheat,
There were walnut trees growing in the field,
He cut them down and burned them as firewood.
The big donkey was pregnant with a little donkey foal,
He frowned with a heavy heart.
He thought two donkeys would have one cut off,
And the next one would have two cut off.
Since last winter until now,
No one has struggled against him.
Everyone said you got rich through labor,
Be bold and get rich, don't be afraid!
At this year's spring plowing mobilization meeting,
He said, "I regret it.
If I had listened to everyone,
Things would always be done right."
Comrades, get rich!
Things will always be done right.”
"Cultivating three and keeping one" must be done,
Getting rich through labor is never to be feared.
Every family is rich,
We won't have to worry about defeating the bandit Chiang.
Every family must make a plan.
There will be a heroes' meeting after the autumn harvest,
Let's see who has the greatest ability.

　　劳动发家快生产
    马如龙
    叫老乡，听我拉，
    我要说说怕发家：
    怕斗争，怕发家，
    他怕村上数着他。
    壶关有个赵老汉，
    查田运动他害怕；
    他光怕给他割尾巴。
    劳动起家不斗争，
    冬天吃个光踏踏。
    卖晌赚了麦一石，
    地里长着核桃树，
    砍下当柴烧了他。
    大驴怀上小驴驹，
    他愁眉不展心事大。
    他想道两驴就要割一个，
    再下一个就割俩。
    自从去冬到现在，
    大家都没斗争他。
    大家说你是劳动发的家，
    大胆致富莫害怕！
    今年春耕动员会，
    他说“我可后悔啦。
    要是听上大家话，
    事情永远办不差”。
    老乡们，发家吧！
    事情永远办不差”。
    耕三余一要做到，
    劳动发家永不怕。
    家家户户都富了，
    蒋贼不愁打不垮。
    家家都要订计划。
    秋后要开群英会，
    看一看谁的本事大。
