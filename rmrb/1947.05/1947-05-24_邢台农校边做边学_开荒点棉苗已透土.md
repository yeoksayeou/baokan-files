　　Xingtai Agricultural School Learns by Doing
    Newly Reclaimed Land's Cotton Sprouts Have Broken Ground
    [Our Newspaper, Xingtai News] The entire student body of Xingtai Agricultural and Forestry Vocational School divided into three large groups on April 28th to carry water and rush to plant cotton. In seven days, they planted 33 mu of the superior cotton variety "Si Zi Mian," including newly reclaimed wasteland, all of which was sown. Most of the seedlings have now emerged from the soil. While carrying water and planting, they simultaneously studied cotton planting techniques. Some students previously had no experience planting cotton, but after this water-carrying and planting exercise, they learned how. They also created ten points of experience: (1) When carrying water to plant cotton, attention should be paid to the depth of planting. Those planted at a depth of about one and a half inches have particularly good germination. Those less than one inch deep are mostly dried by the sun and have not sprouted. Those deeper than two inches are too deep, and some seeds cannot break through the soil. (2) The pits should be dug larger and deeper; if they are too shallow, the water will overflow. (3) Because the soil is dry, if too little water is poured, it is difficult for the seeds to germinate. When planting cotton, put more seeds in each pit (seven or eight seeds per pit). If some don't sprout, others may. (4) When soaking cotton seeds, three different temperatures were used: boiling water, warm water, and cold water. Recent observations after germination show that cotton seedlings soaked in cold water grow very vigorously. (5) The quality of land preparation has the greatest impact on germination. Cotton fields that were plowed more often in the spring had faster and more uniform germination. Those that were only plowed in the autumn and not in the spring had poorer germination. (6) Because carrying water to plant cotton is most prone to drying out, after putting the seeds in the soil pit, gently step on them with your foot. If you only bury the soil without stepping on it, the seeds will dry out in the wind and will not germinate. (7) When soaking cotton seeds that are ready to be planted, check them. If you find that they are bright white when peeled open, they will germinate and sprout. If they are dark yellow or black, they will rot and will not sprout after planting. Planting more seeds in each pit can prevent missing seedlings. (8) When cotton cake is used as base fertilizer in the pit, it must be thoroughly fermented. If it is only half-fermented, it will generate heat, and some cotton seeds will not germinate after planting, suffering from this deficiency. (9) When sowing cotton seeds that have germinated after soaking, cover them well and do not let the sun dry them out; if the buds dry out, they will not sprout. (10) Hairy, thick-skinned cotton seeds and smooth, thin-skinned cotton seeds should not be mixed together for soaking, because the thin-skinned, smooth seeds germinate faster.

　　邢台农校边做边学
    开荒点棉苗已透土
    【本报邢台讯】邢台农林职业学校，四月二十八日全体同学分成三个大组挑水突击种棉，七天即点种优良品种斯字棉三十三亩，连新开出的荒地，也全部下种，现大部已出土。他们在担水点种时，一面劳动，一面研究种棉技术，过去有些同学根本不会种棉，经过这次挑水点种棉花以后，也学会了，并创造十点经验：（一）挑水点种棉花，种时要注意深浅，凡在一寸半深左右的，出苗特别好，不足一寸深的，大部分把种晒干没有出苗，凡在二寸深以上的，就太深了，有的籽就顶不出土。（二）刨坑要大些、深些，浅了倒水就溢出来。（三）因为土干，倒水少了不容易出土，在点棉时，要把坑里多放几颗（每坑七、八颗）种籽，这几颗不出，那几颗就可出。（四）在泡棉籽时，用了三种温度，即开水、温水、冷水浸种观察最近出苗后，凡冷水浸种的，棉苗长的很壮。（五）整地好坏和出苗关系最大，凡春季多耕一遍的棉田，出苗又快又整齐，只秋耕一遍没有春耕的，出苗就比较差。（六）因为挑水点种，最容易刮干，把籽点到土坑以后，要用脚轻轻踏一下，如果只埋土不踏，种籽就会风干不生芽。（七）棉籽泡好快种时，要检查一下，剥开种子，如发现是鲜白色，就能生芽出土，如发现是深黄色或黑色，就会腐烂，种了以后不能出土，每坑多点几颗就可以防止缺苗现象。（八）棉饼下坑内作底粪时，要发熟透，如发的半生不熟，不要发烧，有些棉籽种后没有发芽，就是吃了这个亏。（九）浸种出芽的棉籽，在播种时，要好好盖着不要让太阳去晒，芽子晒干就不出土了。（十）带毛厚皮棉籽和薄皮光棉籽不可混到一起浸种，因为薄皮光籽出芽快。（邢台农联通讯小组）
