　　Unify Strength, Rationally Use Manpower
  　Yi Unit Establishes New Battle Service Department
    [Report from the North Henan Front, May 26th] The Yi Unit under General Liu Bocheng has created a new method for battle service work: the establishment of a unified, centrally led Battle Service Department. The department is staffed with two directors and two political commissars, and is further divided into seven teams: a medical team, a political work team, a burial team, a stretcher-bearer team, a supply group, a material collection and management group, a communications and reporting group, and a prisoner of war group. It also has an armed squad. Each team has clearly defined responsibilities. This cooperative approach saves manpower and ensures the smooth progress of work, eliminating much of the confusion. When temporary tasks arise, the department immediately organizes and leads forces for a concentrated effort. In a recent campaign, the Battle Service Department played a significant role, with battle service work proceeding in an orderly manner. Wounded soldiers were carried down from the front lines soon after the fighting began. The care of the wounded, the management of prisoners, and post-battle work were all handled by dedicated personnel. With concentrated strength, the work progressed quickly. After the battle, many people were commended, and all the stretcher-bearers received commendations.

　　统一力量合理使用人力
  　毅字部新设战勤处
    【本报豫北前线廿六日电】刘伯承将军所部毅字部队，创造战勤工作新方法：成立统一组织，统一领导的战勤处。该处设正副处长两人、正副政委二人，下设医疗队、政工队、掩埋队、担架队、供给组、物资收集管理组、通讯报导组、战俘组等七组，另设一个武装班，各组职务分明。这种分工合作的办法，既节省人力，又能使工作顺利进行，免去很多紊乱的现象。有临时任务发生，该处即统一领导组织力量突击。在最近某次战役中，战勤处起了很大作用，战勤工作有条不紊。战斗开始不久伤员就从火线上抬下来。伤员的救护、俘虏的管理以及战后工作，都有专人负责，力量集中，工作进行很快。战斗结束后很多人记了好，担架组全体工作人员都记了好。
