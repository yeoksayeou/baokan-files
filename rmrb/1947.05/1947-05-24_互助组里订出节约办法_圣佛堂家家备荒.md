　　Mutual Aid Teams Establish Conservation Methods
　　Every Household in Shengfotang Prepares for Famine
　　[Our Jinnan Dispatch, 22nd] Farmers in Shengfotang Village, Weixian County, are all preparing for famine. After several days of deliberation, the village held a mass meeting on the evening of the 11th. They recalled the great famine of 1943. Due to the ravages of the Japanese invaders and feudal exploitation, the land was barren, families were scattered, and many people wept as they talked about this tragic history. Everyone said, "Poor people have little land and no surplus grain, and rely on the heavens for food and planting." Finally, labor hero Shi Decai stopped sobbing and reminded everyone: "That year's famine was also because we were waiting for rain day after day. If it weren't for the Communist Party saving us, could our families still meet?" Then he called on everyone to listen to the Communist Party, and in addition to rushing to plant, they should also prepare for famine. The next day, each team discussed famine preparedness measures during production, and continued to hold a mass meeting in the evening. The Geng Lanyu team challenged the Shi Decai team, and then the fourth and third teams also made challenges. The conditions were: 1. After sowing, dig wells, two for one team, and one each for the third and seventh teams. 2. Combine agriculture and sideline industries throughout the year. 3. Practice strict economy, no foreign cigarettes, no alcohol, and replace white grain (rice and wheat steamed buns) with red grain (sorghum steamed buns). 4. Mutual assistance to overcome famine, and the organization must not collapse. 5. Each team should plant one mu of vegetables by the well pit. 6. All sowing should be completed within five days. 7. Women should immediately organize to spin and weave.
　　[Our Jinnan Dispatch, 22nd] The masses in Qinghe are rushing to plant and prepare for famine. After completing most of the sowing tasks, the masses in Zhangkuan Village, First District, organized twenty salt-boiling teams under the call for famine preparedness. They produced 3,000 jin of salt per day, earning a total profit of 3.25 million yuan in fifteen days. Wang Shuangmiao Village, Second District, distributed all of the 1.1 million yuan from the second batch of fruit on May 6th, and the entire force has shifted to rushing to plant cotton. Ma Yizhang, a 50-year-old from Gexianzhuang Village, and his wife planted more than two mu of cotton in two and a half days.

　　互助组里订出节约办法
    圣佛堂家家备荒
    【本报冀南二十二日电】威县圣佛堂农民家家备荒。经数日酝酿，该村十一日晚召开群众大会，回忆三十二年大灾荒，该村由于日寇蹂躏及封建剥削的结果，灾荒袭来时，田园荒芜，妻离子散，许多人谈到这种悲惨的历史，泣不成声，大家纷纷说：“穷人地少没余粮，靠天吃饭没种上。”最后劳动英雄石德才止住鸣咽，提醒大家：“那年灾荒也怨咱一天天等雨。要不是共产党救了咱们，咱老少爷们还能见面？”接着他号召要听共产党的话，除了抢种之外，还要进行备荒。第二日白天生产中各组都讨论出备荒办法，晚上继续开大会。耿兰玉组向石德才组挑战，接着四组与三组也提出挑战，其条件：一、下种后打井，一组两眼，三、七组各一眼。二、农业、副业结合贯彻全年。三、厉行节约，不吸洋烟、不喝酒，白干粮（米面馍）换成红干粮（高梁面馍）。四、互助渡荒，组织不垮。五、井坑边每组种一亩菜。六、五天以内全部下种。七、妇女马上组织起来纺织。
    【本报冀南二十二日电】清河群众抢种备荒，一区张宽村群众完成大部播种任务后，在备荒号召下又组织成二十个淋盐组，每天出盐三千斤，在十五天内，共获利三百二十五万元。二区王双庙村，于五月六日把二批果实一百一十万元悉数分完，整个力量已转入抢种点棉中。葛仙庄五十多岁的马一彰夫妇二人两天半点种棉花二亩多。
