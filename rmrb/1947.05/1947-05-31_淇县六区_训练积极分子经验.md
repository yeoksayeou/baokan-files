　　Qixian Sixth District
  　Experiences in Training Activists
    In order to powerfully promote the anti-traitor and revenge movement in the new district, the Sixth District of Qixian County launched a short-term training class in Tumen Village on May 6th. Thirty-five villages and one hundred and four people were trained, including forty-five poor peasants, twenty-eight poor farmers, twelve middle farmers, eleven tenant farmers, and eight hired laborers. Before the start of the study, the leadership seized the example of the recovery of Tangyin, explained the current situation, and after a day of deliberation and discussion, some people gained courage. Bao Donghai from Guowan Village said, "Hu Quanlu was very powerful before, relying on Sun Dianying above and the association team below. This time, the Eighth Route Army opened Pang Village (Hu Quanlu's stronghold) with three cannons. His men either ran away or surrendered their guns. Hou Rushan of the association team was killed. Song Pei was captured alive, and even Sun Dianying was captured by the Eighth Route Army. Hu Quanlu's old roots have been dug up, what are we still afraid of?" After the correct ideas of the masses were established, many people's fear of change was resolved. Secondly, informal chats were held, finding people with grievances to chat about their families, how poor they were, how people died, and following the thread of the aggrieved people's words, saying what came to mind. Lu Mingtai, who had been a tenant farmer for Hu Quanlu, dared not speak at first, but later in the chat, he had a lot to say, "I rented ten mu of land from Hu Quanlu, and in the famine year, I didn't see a single grain. The seedlings were eaten by locusts, but he forced me to pay the rent. I really had no choice but to give him my only one mu of vegetable garden, and the whole family cried for several days without anyone caring, and there was nowhere to complain." Wang Xicun of Sanwangzhuang said, "I worked as a farmhand for Song Pei for half my life. Even if my family has enough to eat in the future and doesn't want him to suffer, he won't agree. He forces me to perform free labor every year, plowing five mu of land for him. He is truly unreasonable!"
　Stabilizing Middle Peasants and Clarifying the Goals of Struggle
    After recounting grievances, deliberating, and tracing the roots of poverty, most people were determined to fight, only the middle peasants still showed concerns. Therefore, a general meeting was held to talk about class division and announce the implementation of "land to the tiller" without touching the middle peasants, and everyone understood. After three days of study, everyone felt like doing something, but didn't know how to do it, so it was decided to use the Tumen struggle meeting as a practical teaching material. The activists from each village saw the masses in this village reasoning and complaining to the landlord. Wang Youcheng questioned the object of struggle: "Your child burned my house and robbed my grain, you should compensate me?" The shepherd boy Xiao Shuijing said: "I herded sheep for you for a year, and you didn't pay me, leaving my whole family starving. Now you say should you pay me or not?" The landlord could not deny it and lowered his head on the spot, promising to return the money. After the meeting, everyone broke the idea that struggle was not easy. A village cadre said, "After watching the general meeting, my mind suddenly opened up, and I found the key! I guarantee I can do it when I go back." Wang Youcheng said, "The landlord is sometimes tough and sometimes soft. We are not afraid of him when he is tough, and we cannot pity him when he is soft. There is a way to struggle." The activists from each village have now returned to their villages, and in less than four days, they have started working hard. The masses in Chengguan have executed the big traitor and tyrant Zhao Guoqing. (Taihang Branch)

　　淇县六区
  　训练积极分子经验
    为了有力的推动新区反奸复仇运动，淇县六区于五月六日在土门村开办短期训练班。有三十五个村，一百零四人受训，其中赤贫四十五人，贫农二十八人，中农十二人，佃户十一人，雇工八人。开始学习前，领导上抓紧汤阴收复的实例，对时事做了解释，经过一天酝酿讨论，部分人有了胆量，郭湾村鲍东海说：“扈全禄原很利害，上凭孙殿英，下仗会队，这次八路军三炮打开了庞村（扈全禄的盘据地），他的人马跑的跑，缴枪的缴枪，会队侯如山打死啦。宋配被活捉了，连孙殿英也被八路军捉住了，扈全禄的老根都挖了，咱还怕啥？”群众中的正确思想树立起来之后，很多人的怕变天思想都解决了。其次是不拘形式的漫谈，找有苦人闲谈家常，怎样穷的，人怎样死的，顺着有苦人的话头，说到那里算那里，给扈全禄当过佃户的卢明太开头不敢说，后在闲扯中，他的话真多，“我租种扈全禄的十亩地，灾荒年一籽不见，楷梢（禾苗）都叫蝗虫吃光啦，他逼住非要租子不行，俺实在没法，把仅有的一亩菜园地给了他，全家哭了好几天也没人管，伸冤也无处伸”。三王庄王锡存说：“我给宋配住了半辈子长工，以后俺家够吃了不给他受苦了，他还不答应，强迫每年白尽义务给他代犁五亩地，真不说理！”
　安定中农明确斗争目标
    经过诉苦酝酿追穷根，多数人决心斗，只有中农表现仍有顾虑，于是又开大会讲阶级划分，宣布实现“耕者有其田”中农不动，大家才都想通了。经过三天学习，大家心里想干了，但不知怎么干，就决定把土门斗争会当成个实习教材，各村积极分子看到这村群众和地主说理诉苦，王有成指问斗争对象：“你孩子烧了我的房，抢了我的粮食，你应该包赔我？”放羊小孩萧水晶说：“我给你放了一年羊，你不给工钱，叫俺全家饿着，现在你说该给不该？”地主抵赖不过，当场低头，承许退还。会后，大家打破了斗争不容易的想法，一个村干说：“看了大会，心眼一下就开了，可摸着门啦！回去保险能干起来。”王有成说：“地主是有时硬，有时软，他硬咱不怕，他软咱不可怜他，斗争就有办法。”各村积极分子现已回村，不到四日，便大干开了，城关群众已处决大奸霸赵国庆。（太行分社）
