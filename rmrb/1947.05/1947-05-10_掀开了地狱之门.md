The Gates of Hell Unveiled
    Ge Luo, Bingru
    On April 8th, our People's Liberation Army's 104th unit destroyed the lair of the stubborn bandit leader Cheng Daosheng - the Thirteen Taibao, and captured Cheng Daosheng alive.
    Cheng Daosheng is one of the stubborn bandit leaders with notorious crimes, just like the pseudo-Guo Qing, Wang Ziquan, Si Huasheng, and others. His life of crime is well known in the area east of the Pinghan Railway and along the Yellow River. His father was a local bandit leader, and his elder brother, Cheng Daosheng, served as the pseudo "Third Brigade Commander of the East Asia Allied Autonomous Army" for the Japanese. At that time, Cheng Daosheng was the pseudo regiment commander. In 1942, Cheng Daosheng was killed by our Eighth Route Army, and Cheng Daosheng inherited his brother's criminal position. After the Japanese surrender, he was appointed by the bandit Chiang Kai-shek as the pseudo "Commander-in-Chief of the First Henan People's Self-Defense Corps." For more than ten years, he entrenched himself in the stronghold east of Anyang, using the banner of anti-communism, dominating the area, and devastating the people.
    The people called Cheng Daosheng "Living Yama" (阎王, the King of Hell). He created a living hell here. "Thirteen Taibao Yama's Nest, people passing by are skinned, birds passing by have their feathers plucked." This is the people's description of their miserable life. The central stronghold of Thirteen Taibao, Cheng Taibao, presents a desolate scene that is unbearable to witness. Most of the trees in the village have been cut down for stockades, and the houses have been demolished, with beams used to build bunkers. High blockhouses stand on a pile of ruins. The people's blood and sweat have been drained. Each mu of land has to provide three shi (石, a unit of dry volume) of grain per year, and the amount of money is even more staggering. In the first levy this year alone, each mu of land was charged 50,000 yuan.
    The number of people who have been brutally harmed is in the tens of thousands. The village chief of Qidao Village near Cheng Taibao Village was forced to jump into a well and die because he could not collect the grain (the people had already been squeezed dry). The village chief of Shiziyuan was buried alive in Taibao for the same reason. An old Mr. Ma in Chen Temple committed suicide by hanging himself because he could not afford the grain. Many women have been raped. Cheng Daosheng himself has six "official" concubines, all women snatched from the common people. All young men were forced to join the army. In a family named Wei in Wadian Town, two people were forced to die because of conscription. The life of the soldiers was extremely miserable. A folk song circulated in the villages near Taibao: "The soldiers of Taibao are not to be, they wear ragged clothes and eat chaff, better to see Yama sooner!"
    The suffering could no longer be tolerated. The people of Thirteen Taibao prayed day and night for the arrival of the Eighth Route Army.
    On April 8th, the People's Liberation Army launched a general offensive against Thirteen Taibao. The surrounding strongholds were cleared. At 6:30 in the afternoon, our mountain guns, field guns, and direct-firing guns fiercely bombarded the east and south gates of the central stronghold, Cheng Taibao. Cheng Daosheng was in a panic in Taibao, giving orders: "You fight! Anyang has sent four telegrams saying that reinforcements will arrive by dawn. The Eighth Route Army is not to be feared. Capture one alive and get 500,000 yuan, hand in a gun and get 10,000 yuan. ..." But these orders could not save his fate. Three deep ditches were crossed, and three layers of stockades were destroyed. After the east gate was blown down, the assault team of the 4th company of the 2nd detachment of our 17th district team, under the command of company commander Zhou Lianqi, rushed into the village. Street fighting began, and the enemy's three counterattacks were repelled. Chaos broke out inside Taibao, and the enemies ran and scurried like pigs, throwing their guns on the ground. By 8:30, we had cleared more than 200 enemy bunkers, and more than 2,000 enemy soldiers had become our prisoners. More than 90 light and heavy machine guns became our spoils of war, and Cheng Daosheng himself was captured alive.
    The people of Thirteen Taibao saw the sunshine today, and smiles appeared on their sallow faces. A new folk song is spreading here. The folk song is:
    The Eighth Route Army, is our benefactor,
    Who lifted the gates of hell with one hand….

　　掀开了地狱之门
    葛洛　炳茹
    四月八日，我人民解放军一○四部队，捣毁了顽匪头子程道生的老巢——十三太保，并将程道生活捉了。
    程道生是和伪郭清、王自全、司华生等同样罪恶昭彰的顽匪头子之一，他一生的罪恶史，在平汉路东侧和黄河沿岸一带是尽人皆知的。他的父亲就是地方上的一个土匪头，其兄程逆道河曾当过日本人的伪“东亚同盟自治军第三旅旅长”，程逆道生当时任伪团长。四二年程逆道河被我八路军击毙了，程逆道生就继承了他哥哥的罪恶职务。日本投降后，他又被蒋贼介石委任为伪“河南人民自卫第一总队总队长”。十余年来，他盘据在安阳以东据点，打着反共旗子，称霸四方，涂炭人民。
    老百姓称程道生为“活阎王”，他在这里造下了人间地狱。“十三太保阎王窝，人过剥皮，鸟过拔毛。”这是当地人民痛苦生活的自述。十三太保的中心据点程太保，一片阴惨的景象令人目不忍睹。村里大部树木都被砍作鹿柴，房子被拆了，拿梁木建筑了地堡。一片废墟上耸立着高高的炮楼。老百姓的血汗被吸干了，每亩地一年要给拿三石粮食，款项的数目更是惊人，仅今年第一次征款，每亩地就出了五万元。
    被惨害了的老百姓是要以万计算的。程太保村附近齐道村的村长因催不起粮款（老百姓早被压榨干了），结果被逼着跳井而死，狮子园的村长以同样的理由被拉到太保里活埋了。陈寺的一个马老先生，因拿不起粮款上吊自杀了。许多妇女都遭到了奸淫。程道生一个人有着六个“正式”的小老婆，都是抢夺来的老百姓妇女。所有的青壮年都被强迫着来当兵，瓦店镇一个姓卫的人家因为征丁被逼死了两口人。兵的生活更是凄惨到了顶点，一个歌谣在太保附近的村子里流传着：“太保的兵，不能当，穿的破烂吃的糠，趁早见阎王！”
    苦难再也不能忍受下去了，十三太堡的老百姓日日夜夜祷告着八路军的到来。
    四月八日，人民解放军向十三太保的总进攻开始了。周围的据点都被扫清了。下午六点半钟，我们的山炮，野炮，平射炮猛轰着中心据点程太保的东门和南门，程道生在太保里慌乱地下着命令：“你们打吧，安阳已经来了四次电报，说援兵天明就到，八路军不可怕，捉一个活的给五十万元，缴一枝枪给一万元。……”但这些命令都不能挽回他的命运。三道深沟都被冲过了，三层鹿柴都被破坏了。东门被轰垮以后，我十七区队二小队四连的突击队，在连长周连其的指挥下冲入村里。巷战展开了，敌人的三次反扑均被击退。太保内部慌乱起来，敌人像猪一样的乱跑乱窜，把枪扔到地下。到八点半钟，我们肃清了敌人二百多个地堡，两千多敌兵全部成了我们的俘虏，九十多挺轻重机枪成了我们的战利品，程道生本人也被我们生擒了。
    十三太保的老百姓今天看见了阳光，他们菜色的脸上现出了笑影。一个新的口歌正在这里流传起来。那口歌是：
    八路军，是恩人，
    一手掀开地狱门……。
