　　【Report from this newspaper in Licheng】The Dongyangguan Base Area has established a drought prevention committee to seize the time and fight the spring drought. On May 11th, the Dongyangguan Base Area held a cadre hero cotton-planting review meeting and found that most people had a "wait for rain" mentality when it came to planting cotton. For example, Yang Deyi, the political director of Huoxiangdao, said, "The higher-ups called for planting cotton long ago, but I didn't understand the idea and wanted to wait for rain before planting." Jia Jiangtang, the political director of Dongyangguan, said, "I also didn't want to carry water to plant, and didn't think that the 'Beginning of Summer' would pass and it would be too late." Others said that planting cotton was not as profitable as planting crops. After deliberation and discussion, they realized that planting cotton, calculated at 25 jin of net cotton per mu, was more profitable than planting crops, and that waiting for rain was not an option. Then, slogans such as "If you want to prosper, plant more cotton," and "If you want to get rich, weave more cloth" were put forward, and everyone's thinking became clearer. Technically, it was determined that spot planting was the most suitable method, and soaking the seeds with warm water was appropriate for the current weather, which would both allow them to emerge and support them for a longer time. The standard was 20 dan of water mixed with 3 dan of night soil per mu, which could both moisten the soil and resist drought. All male and female, old and young, full and half labor were accurately calculated and organized to launch a full-scale assault, with women and children watering and dropping seeds, old men filling the holes, and men carrying water. Planting more cotton in nearby areas, and implementing land contracting and exchange in remote areas. For example, Li Tun in Changning has 5.5 mu of land, and he plants crops on 1 mu himself. The Li Qinghe group contracted 4.5 mu of his land to plant cotton completely, and in the fall, they would provide enough grain according to the amount harvested from Li Tun's own 1 mu of land. Teachers offered to be responsible for publicity and broadcasting, and compiled clappers to encourage and praise. Finally, everyone decided to plant a total of 1,493 mu of cotton in the entire base area. In addition to the 412 mu that had already been planted, the remaining 1,081 mu would be guaranteed to be completed within seven days. Villages also put forward competition challenges, and 12 people including Yang Fengxiang were selected to be responsible for inspection. A preliminary inspection and summary would be held on the 26th day of the lunar month, and a grand summary on the 29th. During this period, it was guaranteed that all millet would be planted, and half of the "Golden Queen" crop would be planted, and models would be selected. In order to complete the planting more quickly and on time, it was decided to establish a base area drought prevention committee to direct the planting in a unified manner, and labor hero Wang Jianfu was elected as the director, and Zhang Sikuo, Li Jingxing and seven others as deputy directors, to lead the drought prevention committees in each village. Each village established a village drought prevention committee through mass election, and established contact with the base area committee to promote the work.

　　【Report from this newspaper in Licheng】Yang Jiyuan, the political director of Pingtou Village in the Fourth District, solved the problem of the masses waiting for rain by planting in his own group first. After five days, he went to see that the buds had grown more than an inch long. He immediately publicized this method and convened a meeting of the technical research group leaders of each group to promote this planting method in all groups in the village. Statistics on May 10th showed that more than 240 mu had been planted, and each group said that this method was very successful. (Xiangqin, Huozhi, Fuqun)

　　东阳关基点组织力量战胜天灾
    村村设立防旱委员会
    【本报黎城讯】东阳关基点成立防旱委员会，抓紧时间与春旱作斗争。五月十一日东阳关基点召开干部英雄下种检讨会，发现大部分对种棉存在着等雨思想。如火巷道政治主任杨德义说：“上级早就号召种棉，我思想不通，还想等下了雨再种。”东阳关政治主任贾江堂说：“我也是不想担水栽，并没想立夏过去就误啦。”还有说种棉不如种庄稼有利。经过酝酿讨论后，认识了种棉以每亩产二十五斤净花计算，比种庄稼还有利，同时等待下雨时间不允许。接着提出了“要想发家，多种棉花，”“要想富，多织布”等口号，大家思想上更为明确。在技术上研究出采取点种法最适宜，浸种按目前天气用温水合适，既能出来又能支持时间，每亩以二十担水渗圊三担为标准，圊能泛潮又能抗旱。把男女及老汉儿童全半劳力精确计算组织起来全力突击，妇女儿童浇水跌籽，老汉埋圪道，男人担水。近地多栽远地实行包地换栽，如长宁李吞在地上＠有地五亩半，自己种庄稼一亩，李清何组包他四亩半完全种棉花，秋后按李吞自种一亩地收粮数包够粮食。教员提出负责宣传广播，编快板鼓励表扬。最后，大家决定全基点共种棉花一千四百九十三亩，除已下种四百一十二亩外，下余一千零八十一亩保证在七天内完成，各村并提出竞赛挑战，选出杨逢祥等十二个负责检查，阴历二十六日初步检查总结，二十九日大总结，在这期间保证谷子全部下种，金皇后下种一半，并评选模范。为了更迅速的按时完成下种，决定成立基点防旱委员会，统一指挥下种，选出劳动英雄王建福为正主任，张思魁李景星等七人为副主任，领导各村防旱委员会，各村由群众民选成立村防旱委员会，与基点委员会取得连系，推动工作。（恩魁、何堂、锁兰、建成、有田、时顺）
    【本报黎城讯】四区平头村政治主任杨积元解决群众等雨思想，先在自己组里进行栽种，过了五天去看，芽儿发出一指多长，他当即把这办法宣传出去，并召集各组技术研究组长会，推动全村各组都这样栽，五月十号统计，已栽二百四十余亩，各组都说这办法很成功。（香琴、火帜、富群）
