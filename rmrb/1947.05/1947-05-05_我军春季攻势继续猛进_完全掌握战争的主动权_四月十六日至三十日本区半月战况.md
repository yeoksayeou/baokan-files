The spring offensive of the Jinji-Luyu People's Liberation Army has continued for one month and seven days. Currently, it is continuing to inflict heavier blows on the enemy and expand its victories.

In the past half-month, after our army cut off the Pinghan Railway, cleared the periphery of Anyang, and arranged the battlefield north of the Qi River, as expected, Wang Zhonglian, under the strict supervision of Gu Zhutong, came to walk into the trap. On April 18th, we won a great victory northeast of Qi County, annihilating two of his brigades, killing and capturing more than 13,000 people, and achieving a complete victory in the initial battle of northern Henan. Taking advantage of the victory, we recovered five cities including Hua County, Jun County, Qi County, Fengqiu, and Yangwu, tightly compressing Wang Zhonglian and Sun Zhen's troops into the narrow area south of Xinxiang and Ji County. The Kuomintang-occupied cities of Anyang, Tangyin, and the Daoqing Railway were completely isolated, and the situation in northern Henan changed accordingly.

In the Jinnan area, our army, which entered the lower reaches of the Fen River, crushed the two-pronged attack on Yishi by one and a half brigades of Hu Zongnan's entire 10th Division on the 22nd, annihilating its left wing (the 28th Regiment of the entire 10th Brigade) in Meiyang Town, east of Yishi. Taking advantage of the victory, we recovered six cities including Linjin, Yuxiang, Yongji, Jiexian, Wenxi, and Ruicheng, as well as Fenglingdu, the gateway to the three provinces of Shanxi, Henan, and Shaanxi, overlooking Tongguan and pressing on to Longhai. Xi'an and Luoyang were both shaken. By this point, except for five isolated strongholds such as Yuncheng, Anyi, Pinglu, Xia County, and Yuanqu, the entire Jinnan triangle area had been liberated by us.

At the same time, our northern line troops, in coordination with the Jin-Cha-Ji fraternal troops, launched an offensive against the Zhengtai Railway section from Huolu to Yuci. The Zhengtai Railway between Huolu and Yangquan was completely controlled by us, cutting off the connection between the Kuomintang and Yan Xishan's troops in Shanxi and Hebei, and making Shijiazhuang even more isolated. The Yan Xishan's troops on the Tongpu Railway were hurriedly transferred north, and our army immediately recovered Huo County and Zhaocheng.

In addition, after the main force of the Kuomintang's entire 27th Army in the Ji-Lu-Yu area was transferred east to the Jinpu Railway, the entire 72nd Division was annihilated in Tai'an. The Kuomintang-occupied cities south of the Yellow River were very empty. Our local corps, which persisted in guerrilla warfare in the occupied areas, and the military region troops that crossed the Yellow River from the south, took advantage of the situation to recover five cities including Juye, Jiaxiang, Dongping, Dong'a, and Pingyin, and large areas of occupied territories were liberated. Our troops in the Yu-Wan-Su area once again crossed the New Yellow River and attacked Weishi County on the 13th.

In total, in the 37 days of operations since the launch of the spring offensive, our army has successively recovered and newly liberated 36 county towns in the four areas of northern Henan, southern Shanxi, Ji-Lu-Yu, and Yu-Wan-Su, killing and capturing more than 40,000 Kuomintang troops. Just imagine, from the time Chiang Kai-shek launched a full-scale civil war in July last year until the strategic offensive of the Kuomintang army against our area reached its peak in January this year, Gu Zhutong, Hu Zongnan and others spent a great deal of effort, using more than 56 brigades, consuming countless ammunition and supplies, and changing commanders-in-chief three times on the Ji-Lu-Yu battlefield. As a result, from July last year to January this year, they only managed to exchange the destruction of sixteen entire brigades for thirty-six empty cities. However, in no time at all, once the offensive of our People's Liberation Army was launched, Chiang Kai-shek's "National Army" was eliminated like chickens and dogs; Chiang Kai-shek's "impregnable fortresses" were transferred into the hands of the People's Liberation Army one by one. Our army captured 36 cities in the 37-day offensive, which is equal to the number occupied by the Kuomintang army in half a year. This further proves the growth of the Jinji-Luyu People's Liberation Army in the war, and after a large number of enemy's vital forces have been annihilated, how the initiative of the war is completely in our hands, and giving the enemy continuous and increasingly heavy blows.

### 我军春季攻势继续猛进  完全掌握战争的主动权  四月十六日至三十日本区半月战况

　　我军春季攻势继续猛进
    完全掌握战争的主动权
    四月十六日至三十日本区半月战况
    晋冀鲁豫人民解放军的春季攻势，已经持续了一个月零七天，目前正继续向敌人加重打击，扩张战果。
    半月以来，在我军斩断平汉铁路，扫清安阳外围，安排好淇河以北的战场以后，果然，王仲廉就在顾祝同的严令督进之下，来自投网罗了。四月十八日淇县东北大捷，歼灭其两个旅，毙俘一万三千余人，获得了豫北序战的全胜，并乘胜收复滑县、浚县、淇县、封邱、阳武等五城，把王仲廉、孙震两部紧紧压缩在新乡、汲县及其以南的狭小地区之内，安阳、汤阴及道清线各蒋占城市完全陷于孤立，豫北形势随之改观。
    晋南方面，进入汾河下游的我军，于二十二日粉碎了胡军整十师一个半旅兵力向猗氏的两路进攻，歼灭其左翼（整十旅二八团）于猗氏以东之嵋阳镇，乘胜收复临晋、虞乡、永济、解县、闻喜、芮城等六城及晋豫陕三省门户风陵渡，俯瞰潼关，进逼陇海，西安、洛阳均为之震动。至此，晋南三角地带除运城、安邑、平陆、夏县、垣曲等五个孤立据点之外，已全部为我解放。
    同时，我北线部队配合晋察冀兄弟部队向正太线获鹿至榆次段展开攻势后，正太路获鹿至阳泉间完全为我控制，切断了蒋阎军晋冀间的连系，石家庄更加孤立。同蒲线阎军仓惶北调，我军遂即收复霍县、赵城。
    此外，冀鲁豫方面蒋军主力整二十七军东调津浦线后，七十二师全部在泰安就歼，黄河以南各蒋占城市均十分空虚，我坚持沦陷区游击战争的地方兵团，与南越黄河的军区部队，遂乘虚收复巨野、嘉祥、东平、东阿、平阴等五城，大块沦陷区重获解放。豫皖苏我军则于十三日再一次西渡新黄河袭入尉氏县城。
    总计，春季攻势开展以来三十七天的作战中，我军已在豫北、晋南、冀鲁豫、豫皖苏四区先后收复与新解放了县城三十六座，毙俘蒋军四万余人。试想自去年七月蒋介石发动全面内战时起，至今年一月蒋军对本区的战略攻势发展至顶点时为止，整整半年时间，顾祝同、胡宗南等辈费了九牛二虎之力，使用了五十六个旅以上的兵力，耗费了无数的弹药粮秣，并在冀鲁豫战场上三易主帅，而其结果，从去年七月至今年一月也不过以十六个整旅的覆灭，换取了三十六座空城。但是，曾几何时，一旦当我人民解放军的攻势发动之后，蒋介石的“国军”，便都像土鸡瓦犬的消灭了；蒋介石的“金城汤池”，一个个的都转入人民解放军手中。我军则在三十七天的攻势中攻克三十六城，正等于蒋军半年中所侵占之数；这就更加证明了晋冀鲁豫人民解放军在战争中的成长，与在大量歼灭了敌人的有生力量之后，战争的主动权是如何的完全掌握在我们手中，而予敌人以连续不断的愈来愈重的打击。
