　　I Launch Psychological Warfare in the Siege of Tangyin

　　[Special dispatch from the North Henan Front, May 1st] Our reporter Ke Gang reports: Under the walls of Tangyin city, the sounds of war horses are faint. The 68th Unit under the command of General Liu Bocheng is launching a fierce psychological warfare campaign against the defending enemy prior to the main assault. Many psychological warfare teams are tirelessly active day and night in the trenches, only 30 meters away from the city walls. They can conduct verbal persuasion against the enemy under any circumstances and erect mats and wooden boards during the day to create eye-catching wall newspapers for the enemy. These wall newspapers often cause enemy soldiers to cease firing. According to political instructor Li Qingfu, the most effective method is to load propaganda materials into small iron tubes, write "Treasure Inside" on them, and throw them into the city at night. Alternatively, propaganda materials are tied to arrows and shot into the city. The combat significance of the "attack on the mind" and "attack on the city" being carried out simultaneously has been deeply understood by the soldiers. Everyone is constantly thinking of ways to create more opportunities. Even during intense fighting, some people tie propaganda materials to grenade handles and throw them at the enemy. It is said that this method does not damage the propaganda materials.

　　[Special dispatch from the North Henan Front, May 1st] Our reporter Ke Gang describes the scene of psychological warfare in the suburbs of Tangyin: As dusk approaches, the tens of thousands of lights on Tangyin city, which Sun Dianying uses to bolster his courage, are quickly lit. Gunfire gradually subsides, and a dramatic psychological warfare campaign quietly begins here. A loudspeaker extends from the People's Liberation Army's prone firing position, broadcasting astonishing news: "Hey, let us tell you some good news. The reinforcements that Wang Zhonglian brought to you have had more than two brigades wiped out by us in the northeast of Qi County. Your Rapid Second Column has been completely annihilated. We captured alive the brigade commander Li Shouzheng, deputy brigade commander Jiang Tiexiong, and Yuan Zhishan. We heard that Wang Zhonglian told you to run away, but how can you possibly escape! You should lay down your weapons sooner rather than later, so you don't look bad in the future!" "Hey, are there any people from Lin County inside? In our liberated areas, the poor have stood up. Your families also have land to cultivate and food to eat. Don't you want to go back and see?" Both sides completely ceased firing. "Eighth Route Army, Eighth Route Army: Why are you besieging us?" Someone on the city wall poked his head out and then ducked back in: "Don't shout, you listen to your family!" Another person said: "Because you only harm the common people and don't do anything for the Chinese people. You used to work for the Japanese, and now you follow Chiang Kai-shek to work for the Americans." Suddenly, the flashlight of the officer on patrol flashed, and the city began firing again. "Don't shoot, let me talk to him." Someone said loudly: "Eighth Route Army, are you reasonable or not? You say that we harm the common people and work for the Americans, but you kill and set fires and work for the Soviets." "I ask you, who came out of the city yesterday and burned down the civilian houses in Dongguan? Who did the American planes come to deliver bullets to this morning? What is it that you eat, wear, and the guns and ammunition that isn't given to you by the Americans? Why don't Soviet planes come and deliver bullets to us? Which one of our guns wasn't seized from the hands of Japanese devils and Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous troops with our blood and flesh? Who is it that is being unreasonable? I ask you again: Who signed the traitorous commercial treaty with the United States? We implement 'land to the tiller' in the liberated areas, but the Soviets haven't come to China to farm..." Silence. A rare moment of silence before the two armies. In the silence, the members of the People's Liberation Army's psychological warfare team fully drew their bamboo bows, and arrows carrying propaganda materials were shot onto the city walls, whizzing through the air, piercing the remorseful and ashamed hearts of those on the city walls.

　　汤阴围困战中我展开攻心战
    【本报豫北前线一日电】本报记者柯岗报导：汤阴城下兵马萧萧，刘伯承将军麾下六八部队在大攻击前对守敌展开猛烈攻心战，许多攻心小组日夜不停的活跃在距城三十公尺之战壕中，他们在任何情况下均能对敌进行喊话。并在白天竖起席子和木板，用醒目大字办对敌墙报。这种墙报常使敌军士兵停止射击。据政治指导员李庆福谈：最有效的办法是将宣传品装入小铁筒内，上书“内中有宝”，深夜投入城内。或将宣传品捆在箭上，射入城中。“攻心”、“攻城”双管齐下的战斗意义，已被战士们深刻理解。在大家不断的积极想办法中创造颇多，即在激战中也有人把宣传品拴在炸弹柄上对敌投掷，据说此种办法并不毁坏宣传品。
    【本报豫北前线一日电】本报记者柯岗描述汤阴城郊攻心战时的情景称：黄昏到来的时候，汤阴城上孙逆殿英借以壮胆的万盏灯火迅即燃起，枪声渐渐稀疏了，一幕激剧的攻心战在这里悄然开始。从人民解放军的立射掩体中伸出一个大喇叭，那里传出了惊人的消息：“喂喂，告诉你们一个捷报，王仲廉给你们带来的援兵，有两个多旅在淇县东北被我们歼灭了。你们的快速第二纵队全部被歼灭了。我们活捉了旅长李守正、副旅长蒋铁雄、袁峙山。听说王仲廉叫你们逃跑，你想那怎能跑掉！还是早点放下武器吧，不要等将来不好看！”“喂，你们里边有林县人没有？我们解放区穷人都翻身啦，你们家里也有地种有饭吃啦，你们不想回去看看吗？”双方完全停止了射击。“八路军、八路军：你们为啥包围我们呀？”城墙上有人一露头就缩进去了：“不要嚷，你听家人说么？”另一个人这样说：“因为你们光糟害老百姓，不替中国人办事。从前替日本办事，现在又跟上蒋介石替美国办事”，忽然查哨军官的电筒一闪，城上又茫然打起枪来。“不要打，让我跟他讲”。有人这样大声说：“八路军，你们讲理不讲？你说我们糟害老百姓，替美国办事，你们杀人放火，替苏联办事”。“我问你，是谁昨天从城里出来把东关民房都烧光了？今天上午美国飞机是来给谁送子弹的？你们吃的、穿的、枪炮子弹那一样不是美国给的？为什么苏联飞机不来给我们送子弹？我们的枪那一枝不是用血肉从日本鬼子和蒋介石卖国军队的手中夺过来的？你说到底是谁不讲理？我再问你：是谁和美国订了卖国商约？我们在解放区实行耕者有其田，苏联人并没有来中国种地呀……”。沉默，在这两军阵前难得的，默里，人民解放军的攻心组员们拉满了竹弓，一条条带着宣传品的箭射上城头，嗖的一声，从城上那些懊恨而又惭悔的心上穿过去。
