　　Ideological Leadership of New Soldiers
　　Nan Fei
　　Providing ideological leadership to new soldiers is a complex and meticulous task. The Sixth Company of a certain replenishment regiment has created extremely valuable experiences in this regard, yielding great results. It is now being presented as a typical example for your reference:

　　The Sixth Company received over 120 new soldiers from the Fifth District of Shahe, the majority of whom were from middle and poor peasant backgrounds. When all the company cadres went to the district to gather the new recruits, the local people brought many gifts of comfort. The new soldiers took these for their own use, and although the cadres were unhappy, they did not strictly prohibit it. On the march back to the unit's station, many young men arbitrarily left the ranks to throw stones, make jokes, and even go up the mountain to play during rest periods, without being disciplined. They believed that the new recruits had not yet shed their loose rural habits, and that discipline could not be improved as quickly as in veteran units.

　　The company instructor was physically weak, even helping others carry their bedrolls on the road. The new soldiers all said, "The Eighth Route Army is so good, the cadres can really endure hardship." After arriving at the unit's garrison, they formed squads and established organizations the next day, stipulated rules of life, and the instructor took the lead, sharing a blanket with soldiers at night and fetching water and bedpans for the sick. Soldiers Zhu Qingyue and Su Yunzhi from the Eighth Squad, feeling homesick, deserted. On their way, they were moved by the instructor's care and concern for the soldiers, and felt that they were letting the instructor down by leaving, so they returned on their own accord. Comrade Instructor seized this opportunity and, starting with the Eighth Squad, initiated a research and discussion on consolidating the unit. Everyone unanimously agreed on a joint pact to be observed by the entire squad, vowing not to desert. A dozen other squads responded at once. Only the Twelfth Squad did not trust the process and dared not make a commitment, so he mobilized representatives from other squads to persuade them until the entire company vowed to abide by the pact. The second step was to start a "speak bitterness" movement.

　　At first, the term "speak bitterness" was not explicitly mentioned. Instead, they first looked for activists and used a "talking about family matters" approach to guide out the bitterness of soldiers who had suffered. They conducted individual visits to listen to their stories, and individual investigations, and there were those who cried in the squad. Then, they convened a company-level military conference to mobilize the troops. The instructor said, "I heard that everyone has some grievances that you can talk about with your own people. The Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army helped you turn over a new leaf, and are your relatives. You should tell your heartfelt words to your relatives." During the mobilization, the entire field was filled with an atmosphere of grief and indignation. They didn't sing cheerful songs, but songs about emancipation; they didn't whisper or laugh, but not by prohibition, but by explanation, such as saying, "Everyone has their own suffering, and we should care for each other as a family. Show sympathy for the hardships of comrades. Suffering is given by the enemy. Everyone can think about their own suffering, without disturbing others, and without going out, to avoid distraction." After the mobilization, each squad returned to have heart-to-heart talks, with cadres participating by division of labor. Among the ten people who participated in the discussion in the Sixth Squad, eight cried loudly during the talks, and one cried softly. After the talks, activists were gathered to report, and twenty-four of the most bitter typical cases were selected for individual mobilization to speak about their suffering at the meeting. At first, they were still shy and unwilling to speak. By the afternoon, a company-wide military conference was held with ninety-five new soldiers in attendance (cooks, sick people, etc. did not participate), and cadres at all levels participated. After the instructor spoke, he announced a three-minute silence to allow everyone to think. Then, the instructor was the first to speak about his own suffering. It turned out that he had worked in the White Area and was arrested, suffering all kinds of humiliation and abuse, which led to a nervous breakdown from which he has not yet recovered. After the instructor spoke, the twenty-four comrades who had suffered were all vying to speak. After only a few people had spoken, both the listeners and the speakers began to weep sadly. At this time, in order to prevent the time from dragging on too long, and to avoid the bitterness being expressed in too general a way, it was announced that there would be a five-minute cry, and then, with a "waaah" sound, the entire field burst into loud wailing, and the entire field was filled with an extremely indignant hatred towards the enemy. After crying, the question was raised: What should we do with so much suffering? The unanimous cry was revenge! At this time, a few topics were given for the new soldiers to discuss back in their squads. 1. What to do with suffering? 2. Is it guaranteed that you will have turned over a new leaf? How to defend the fruits of the struggle? 3. How to avenge your parents and siblings? 4. How to repay Chairman Mao's kindness? After discussion, the conclusion of the twelve squads was the same, that is, not to desert and go home, to intensify military training, to join the main force to defeat Chiang Kai-shek, to eradicate the roots of poverty, to avenge their parents, and to repay the kindness of the Communist Party, the Eighth Route Army, and Chairman Mao.

　　The third step was to conduct a "frankness" movement, discover problems, untie the ideological knots of the new soldiers, and persuade them with mobilization: speak heartfelt words, speak personal matters, whoever speaks his heart, who is the most happy, who speaks most thoroughly, who is most frank, who says he is a frank hero, if there is a problem, speak it out and everyone will solve it, and only by solving the problem can you practice martial arts well and take revenge. After the mobilization, they still went back to each squad to share their thoughts, talking to each other, asking each other, speaking their own minds, and if they knew others but they didn't speak, then they would speak for them. As a result of the talks, the summarized report materials showed that there were five who wanted to go home to see their wives, two who were married, one who wanted to find a partner (lover), one whose wife had given birth to a child and no one was taking care of her and asked to go back to take a look, and two whose families had sick people and wanted to go home to visit them, and others who wanted to go home to get money. One nineteen-year-old young soldier had dozens of eggs at home hatching chicks and wanted to see if they had hatched. Problems like these, when summarized, there were only two: one was homesickness, and the other was fear of death, and fear of death was just another form of expression. After collecting these problems, the instructor did not offer explanations from the front. Instead, he first found some descriptions of inhuman life in the Chiang-controlled areas from the newspapers, the victory news from the front lines of the liberated areas, and a few related short stories (such as a liberated farmer who took a landlord's daughter as his wife, but was poisoned to death by his wife), and gathered all the soldiers of the company to read the newspaper, making some explanations aimed at the thinking of the new soldiers. After speaking, he announced, "There are five people in our company who want to go home to see their wives..." etc. Every time he announced a sentence, there were low murmurs, private comments, and contemptuous gestures. People with ideological problems could not withstand these stimuli. For example, those who wanted to find a partner or see the chicks gave up their opinions on the spot. The instructor said, "It's good that everyone has problems to bring up, it's good for everyone to think of solutions, everyone's affairs are handled by everyone, I alone cannot make the decision, each squad knows the problems raised by each squad, everyone go back to discuss, discuss how to do it, and we will do it that way." After the meeting, each squad went back to discuss, and all the discovered problems were solved very reasonably and very appropriately. After the solutions, some even went to the company headquarters to see the instructor, stamping their feet anxiously and repeatedly asking: "Instructor, I wasn't thinking about my wife there, do you think everyone said I was thinking about my wife?… I had that thought before, but I really don't have it now." In fact, the instructor had not said anyone's name, so he had to say, "You are not one of the five who want their wives," and he went back relieved. From then on, the instructor constantly read good letters from home to everyone, and helped the soldiers write letters from home, so that the entire company was at peace and happy.

　　The final step was to summarize. All the frankness heroes, reflection heroes, and persuasion heroes selected in the past were gathered together, a grand occasion. Each squad selected one hero, for a total of twelve people, and then three people were selected from the twelve people. These three people represented three types, one who had transformed from fear of death, one who had transformed from wanting his wife, and one who had thought things through for family matters. They were asked to report on their transformation process at the meeting. After the reports were completed, they swore an oath: "We will not go home until we defeat Chiang Kai-shek." After the oath, flowers were presented, and the heroes wore various kinds of flowers on their chests. After the flower presentation, they celebrated wildly, singing hero songs, and many heroes were lifted up by the masses, jumping and skipping, and the meeting ended in joyful cheers.

　　对新战士的思想领导
    南飞
    对新战士的思想领导，是一个复杂而又细致的工作，某补充团第六连，在这方面创造出极可宝贵的经验，收效很大，现在作为一个典型，介绍于下：
    第六连接收了沙河五区的新战士，共一百二十余人，大多数为中贫农成份。当全连干部到该区把新战士集中以后，老百姓送来很多慰劳品，被新战士拿去自用，干部虽不高兴，也没有严格制止。带部队回来的行军路上，有不少青年，擅自离开队伍投石子，开玩笑，休息时还有上山玩的，都没加管束。他们认为新战士没有脱出散漫的农村生活习惯，不能像对待老部队一样，纪律是逐步提高的。
    该连指导员身体很弱，路上还帮别人背被包。新战士都说：“八路军真好，干部真能吃苦。”到部队驻地，次日即编队，建立组织，规定生活制度，指导员以身作则，晚上与战士盖被子，替病号打水端尿。八班战士朱庆月、苏运之落后想家，开了小差，行到半路，因指导员爱护战士，关心战士，受了感动，认为自己走了对不起指导员，又自动返回来了。指导员同志抓紧这一点，就从八班开始，发起巩固部队的研究讨论，大家一致议定一个全班遵守的联合公约，宣誓不开小差，一时响应的有十几个班，只有十二班并不信任，不敢规定，他又发动其他班派代表劝说，直到全连宣誓愿遵守公约为止。第二步就着手进行诉苦运动。
    开始时并不明显提出“诉苦”二字，先找积极分子，用说家常的形式，把有苦战士的苦指引出来，个别访苦，个别调查，在班里就有哭的。然后，召开连的军人大会，进行动员，指导员说：“听说大家有些冤枉事，可以给咱们自己人谈谈，共产党八路军帮助你们翻了身，就是亲人，知心话要对亲人说说。”动员时，全场充满了一种悲愤空气，不唱欢歌，唱翻身歌，不私语，不谈笑，但不是制止，而是解释，如说：“各人有各人的苦，一家人应该互相关心，对同志的苦事表同情，苦是敌人给的，各人想各人的苦，不妨碍别人，也不外出，免于分散注意力。”动员后，各班回去谈心，干部分工参加，六班参加讨论的十人，谈话中八人大哭，一个小哭。谈毕召集积极分子汇报，选取二十四个最苦的典型；进行个别动员，到大会上诉苦，当初仍怕羞不愿说，等到下午开全连军人大会，到会新战士九十五人（炊事员病号等未参加），并有各级干部参加，指导员讲话后，宣布静默三分钟，让大家思索。接着指导员首先诉苦，原来该同志曾在白区工作被捕，受尽百般侮辱虐待，弄得神经失常，至今未能恢复健康。经指导员一讲，那二十四个有苦的同志都争先恐后抢着讲话。还仅诉过几个人，听的人和诉的人都悲痛得哭泣起来。此时，为使时间不致拖延过长，不致诉苦太一般化了，就宣布大哭五分钟，于是，哇的一声，全场嚎啕大哭起来，全场洋溢着极端悲愤的对敌仇恨情绪。哭罢，提出咱们有这么多的苦处应该怎样办？一致的呼声是报仇！这时候出了几个题目，要新战士回各班讨论。一、有苦怎么办？二、翻了身是不是保险？怎样保卫斗争果实？三、怎样给父母兄弟报仇？四、怎样向毛主席报恩？讨论后，十二个班的结论是一样，即不开小差不回家，加紧练武，参加主力军打败蒋介石，刨掉穷根，为父母报仇，向共产党八路军毛主席报恩。
    第三步是搞坦白运动，发现问题，为新战士解开思想圪瘩，劝说会动员：说知心话，心事话，谁把心里话说出，谁最愉快，谁说得彻底，谁最坦白，谁说是坦白英雄，有问题说出来大家解决，解决了问题，才能练好武，才能报仇雪恨。动员后，依然回各班拉心事，互相说，互相问，自己心事自己讲，知道别人的他不说就替他讲，讲的结果，综合汇报材料，有五个想回家看老婆的，两个结婚的，一个想找对象（爱人），一个老婆生了小孩无人招呼要求回去看看的，二个家里有病人想回家探望的，其他还有回家取钱用的。一个十九岁的青年战士，有几十颗鸡蛋在家孵小鸡，要想去看看孵出来没有？诸如此类的问题，归纳起来，只有两个：一个是想家，一个是怕死，怕死不过是采用另一种形式说出的罢了。指导员搜集了这些问题之后，不从正面提出解释，先从报纸上找出一些蒋管区非人生活的描述，解放区前线的胜利消息，和几个有关的小故事（如一个翻身农民要了地主姑娘做老婆，为老婆毒死），集合全连战士读报，针对新战士思想作些解释，讲完后，就宣布“咱们连里有五个想回家看老婆……”等的汇报材料，每宣布一句，就听到有低声啧啧私下评议与轻视举动。思想上存在有问题的人，经受不起这些刺激，如找对象，看小鸡，就当场放弃意见了。指导员说：“大家有问题提出来是好的，提出来大家好想办法解决，大家的事大家办，我一个人不能作主，各班提出的问题各班都知道，大家回去讨论，讨论说怎样办，咱就怎样办。”散了会各班回去讨论，所有发现的问题，都得到非常合理非常恰当的解决。解决后还有到连部见指导员，急的跺脚连声问：“指导员我那里想老婆咧，你当大家说我想老婆？………先前有，现在真没有了”。其实指导员并没说出过任何一个人的名字，只好说：“那五个想老婆的里面没有你”，他才安心的回去了。以后，指导员不断把好的家信读给大家听，帮战士写家信，做到全连安心愉快。
    最后一步是总结。把历次选拔出来的坦白英雄、反省英雄、劝说英雄都集拢来，济济一堂，每班选出一名英雄，共选十二人，再从十二人中选出三人，这三个人代表着三种类型，一个是有怕死思想转变了的，一个是想老婆转变了的，一个是为家务事纠缠想开了的，要他们在大会上报告转变经过。报告完时，举行宣誓：“不打败蒋介石不回家”。宣誓毕，献花，英雄们胸前带上各色各样的花朵。献花毕，狂欢唱英雄歌，许多英雄被群众抬起来，蹦蹦跳跳，在欢乐声中散会结束。
