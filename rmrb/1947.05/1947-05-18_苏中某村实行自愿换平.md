Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 15th. A village in Liansheng Township, Yongfeng District, Xinghua, Central Jiangsu, used the method of "voluntary land exchange" to adjust land plots during the review, creating unprecedented unity in the whole village. A certain military dependent exchanged two mu of high-lying land on a distant embankment for Li Wensheng, who needed high-lying land to grow vegetables, and the review committee helped him exchange it for two mu of nearby land. Li Shengwen divided two mu of land near Li Neizhi's house to Li Neizhi, making up for Li Neizhi's basic shortage. For a time, mutual exchange became a mass upsurge in the whole village, and everyone said happily: "Our exchange of land has brought us closer, and exchanging one mu is faster than gaining three mu." Due to the mutual exchange, seven households had complete land plots, six households obtained sites, households lacking labor obtained nearby and easy-to-cultivate land, and households with more labor obtained whole plots of land with richer harvests, satisfying every family.

    实行自愿换平
    【新华社华中十五日电】苏中兴化永丰区联胜乡某村复查中，以“自愿换平”方法，调整田亩，造成全村空前大团结。某军属将二亩嫌远的垛子田高地，换给需要高地种菜的李文生，又由复查委员帮他换了二亩近田，李生文将靠近李内之屋宅的二亩田分给李内之，补平了李内之的基本不足数。一时互换成了全村群众性的热潮，个个兴高采烈地说：“我们换田换出亲来了，换一亩比进三亩还快活。”因互换使田亩完整的有七户，得到场地的六户，缺劳动力户得到了近田和易种田，劳动力多的换得了整块而收成较丰的田，家家满意。
