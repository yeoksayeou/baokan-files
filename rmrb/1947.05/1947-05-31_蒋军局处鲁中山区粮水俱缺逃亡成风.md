　　Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 29th: Chiang Kai-shek's defeated troops in the central Shandong area are in extreme panic. Wherever they go, they dare not enter large villages, only small ones. It is said that large villages are all mined. Later, even small villages would explode, forcing them to climb to the mountain tops. For example, in the Lianhua Mountains, they did not stay in Tianjialin Village, but rather on the summit of Nanci Mountain near the village. When they invaded Yanzhuang (northwest of Mengyin), they did not occupy the village, but instead established large camps on the two mountain peaks to the southeast and southwest. Even the chickens and ducks they plundered in the village were taken to the mountain tops to be slaughtered. But the mountain tops have Shandong's unique "flavor"—scorching sun during the day, unbearably hot; at night, cool winds blow, with a piercing chill. During the battles in northern Jiangsu and southern Shandong, because most of the area was plains, hundreds of cars, trucks, and jeeps came and went, quite lively; once they entered the mountainous area, they had to abandon all these contraptions and switch to mules and horses. Thus, Chiang's defeated troops and herds of mules and horses were scattered on countless mountain tops, lacking food and water, the men and horses exhausted, leading to extremely serious desertion. Taking the reorganized 11th Division, one of the three main forces of Chiang's offensive against Shandong, along with the 74th Division and the 5th Army, as an example, the reconnaissance platoon of the 32nd Regiment of the 11th Brigade of that division painstakingly captured 32 conscripts, but 26 of them deserted at once. The 7th Company of the 3rd Battalion of the 52nd Regiment of the 88th Brigade lost 15 men when it moved slightly. Five men from the transport company of the 118th Brigade deserted after stopping for a meal. After the annihilation of the 74th Division, other Chiang Kai-shek troops universally reflected: "If the 74th Division has been annihilated, what about us? If we encounter the Eighth Route Army, we'll drop our guns early."

### 蒋军局处鲁中山区粮水俱缺逃亡成风

　　蒋军局处鲁中山区粮水俱缺逃亡成风
    【新华社山东二十九日电】局处于鲁中山区之蒋家败军异常恐慌。他们每至一地，不敢进大庄，只敢住小庄。据说凡是大庄里都埋着地雷。后来小庄里也会爆炸，迫着他们爬上山顶。例如他们在莲花山里不住田家林庄，而住该庄附近的南刺山顶。侵占颜庄（蒙阴西北）时，庄里不占，却在东南和西南两个山峰扎个大营。连在庄里抢的鸡鸭也拿到高山顶上去宰杀。但高山顶上有着山东特有的“风味”，白天赤日炎炎，热得要命；入晚凉风吹来，寒气袭人。敌军在苏北与鲁南会战时，因大部分是平原，成百辆汽车、卡车、吉普车来来往往，好不热闹；一进入山区，只好把这些劳什子统统丢掉，改用骡马。于是蒋家败军和成群骡马分布在无数山头上，粮水俱缺，人困马疲，致逃亡现象极为严重，以与七十四师、第五军同为蒋军进攻山东的三大主力之一的整十一师为例，该师十一旅三十二团搜索排辛辛苦苦抓来卅二个壮丁，一下子跑掉廿六个。八十八旅五十二团三营七连稍一移动，十五个人不知去向。一一八旅输送连停下来吃一餐饭，五个人开了小差。七十四师被歼灭后，蒋家其他部队普遍反映：“七十四师都被歼灭了，还谈我们？碰到八路军，老子早点放下枪杆。”
