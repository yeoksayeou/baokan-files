　　Japanese Communist Party Issues Statement
  　Supporting Socialist Party to Form New Government
    【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th】 TASS, Tokyo: A news agency reports that the Japanese Communist Party issued a statement on the 22nd, stating that the Liberal Party should bear full responsibility for the current complex political situation in Japan arising from negotiations for a coalition government. The statement said: Once the Liberal Party saw that they would not get the position of prime minister, they disregarded negotiations to form a coalition government and shouted their anti-communist slogans like Hitler's followers in the past. The Socialist Party, due to its attempt to unite with the anti-socialist Liberal Party, failed to implement its platform with sufficient strength and courage, thus aggravating the current political situation. After the Democratic Party, taking advantage of the division between the two parties, played tricks, the situation became even more serious. Therefore, the Communist Party announced that it would fully form a democratic front to support a government led by socialists.
    【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th】 Tokyo: The new Japanese parliament held its first meeting on the afternoon of the 23rd and elected Tetsu Katayama, chairman of the Social Democratic Party, as prime minister. Katayama also received formal appointment from the Emperor on the 24th. Regarding the issue of forming a coalition cabinet, it is reported that the Democratic Party will abandon its insistence on forming a four-party coalition cabinet (referring to the Social Democratic Party, the Democratic Party, the Liberal Party, and the National Cooperative Party). Secretary-General of the Liberal Party, Banboku Oono, stated: The Liberal Party has finally decided not to participate in the coalition cabinet. Note: Tetsu Katayama is a right-wing leader of the Social Democratic Party, from the upper class of the petty bourgeoisie, and is a Christian.

　　日共发表声明
  　支持社会党组新政府
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】塔斯社东京讯：某通讯社报导，日本共产党于二十二日发表声明谓：对于因谈判联合政府所产生的日本目前复杂的政局，自由党应负完全责任。该声明称：自由党一旦看出他们将得不到首相的位置，他们就漠视组织联合政府的谈判，并且如过去希特勒党徒一样，大喊其反共口号。社会党由于图与反社会主义的自由党联合，致未能用充分的力量与勇气实行其政纲，因而使目前的政治局势严重化。在利用两党间分歧的民主党玩弄花样之后，局势更形严重，因此共产党宣布该党将全力组成民主阵线，支持以社会党人为首的政府。
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】东京讯：日本新议会于二十三日下午开首次会议，选举社会民主党主席片山哲为首相，片山并于二十四日得日皇之正式任命。关于组织联合内阁问题，传民主党将放弃坚持组织四党联合内阁（按系社会民主党、民主党、自由党、国民协同党）。自由党书记长大野伴睦声称：自由党已最后决定不参加联合内阁。按：片山哲为社会民主党右派领袖，出身小资产阶级的上层，是一个基督教徒。
