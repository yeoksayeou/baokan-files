　　Seventeen Villages in Taihang Mountains
    Complete Weaving Target 100 Days Ahead of Schedule
    [Reported from Taihang, 17th of this month] Seventeen villages in Taihang's Pingshun, Huguan, Shahe and other counties have completed their 100-day weaving plans ahead of schedule. These seventeen villages have a total of 6,648 weaving women. Within 60 to 80 days, they not only completed the original plan of 72,818 jin of homespun cloth, but also exceeded the plan by 3,514 jin. The main reasons for the early completion are: in-depth ideological education was conducted at the beginning of the movement; weaving women were universally organized and expanded under the leadership and promotion of heroic activists; technology was improved, and tools were renovated. After Pingshun Wangzhuang Village resolved the fear of weaving for the public and stipulated an 80/20 split of profits between the household and the collective (80% for the household, 20% for the collective), all 177 weaving women in the village completed the 100-day weaving plan of 5,396 jin of homespun cloth in 77 days. Chi Di completed the plan in 70 days and exceeded it by 200 jin. Six villages, including Hongtiguan, also exceeded the plan by 1,657 jin in 60 days. Eight villages, including Huangjiachuan in Huguan's Second District, also successfully completed the 100-day weaving plan in mid-April, completing all 17,700 jin of homespun cloth that should have been woven. Currently, these villages are summarizing and selecting heroes, conducting rewards, re-formulating new weaving plans, and further developing the weaving movement. The completion of the plan has greatly increased the income of the rural areas. According to calculations from Pingshun Wangzhuang Village alone, the net profit reached 5,396,000 yuan. With each斗 (dǒu) of rice priced at 500 yuan, 1,078 石 (shí) of rice can be purchased. With each person eating 3 斗 (dǒu) of rice per month, this is enough for all 732 people in the village to eat for four and a half months with surplus.

　　太行十七个村
    百日纺织提前完成
    【本报太行十七日电】太行平顺、壶关、沙河等县，已有十七个村庄提前完成了百日纺织计划。该十七村共六千六百四十八个纺织妇女，在六十天至八十天内，不仅完成了原计划土布七万二千八百一十八斤，并超过计划三千五百一十四斤。提前完成的主要原因是：运动初期进行了深入的思想教育，在英雄积极分子带头与推动下，普遍组织起来扩大了纺织妇女；提高了技术，改造了工具。平顺王庄村解决了怕给公家纺织与规定和家庭二八分红（家八自二）后，全村一百七十七个纺织妇在七十七天内完成了土布五千三百九十六斤的百日纺织计划。池底七十天内除完成计划外，还超过二百斤。虹梯关等六村在六十天内也超过计划一千六百五十七斤。壶关二区黄家川等八村也提前于四月中旬胜利的完成了百日纺织计划，将应纺织之一万七千七百斤土布全部完成。现这些村庄正进行总结选拔英雄，进行奖励，重订新的纺织计划，进一步开展纺织运动。计划的完成，大大增加了农村的收入，仅平顺王庄一个村计算：净余利即达五百三十九万六千元。每斗米价按五百元，可买米一千零七十八石，每人每月吃米三斗，够全村七百三十二口人吃四个半月尚有余。
