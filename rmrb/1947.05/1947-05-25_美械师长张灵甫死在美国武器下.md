　　Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 23rd: Zhang Lingfu, commander of the 74th Division, the first American-equipped division and Chiang Kai-shek's elite main force, has been killed by American weapons in the hands of the People's Liberation Army. On the fourth day (May 16th) of the Menglianggu annihilation battle in the Yimeng Mountains, when the headquarters of Chiang's 74th Division was being wiped out, Zhang Lingfu attempted to break through and escape. An American-made Thompson submachine gun of the People's Liberation Army blocked his path, and a bullet hit Zhang's posterior brain, killing him. After the body was found, Huang Zheng, the captured colonel of the division's Quartermaster Regiment, Lei Liqun, the colonel of the 172nd Regiment of the 58th Brigade, and Zhang Guangdi, Zhang Lingfu's personal secretary, went to identify it. They confirmed that Zhang's posterior brain had been shattered by Thompson bullets, the blood and brain matter had dried up, he had a long rectangular face and a high nose bridge, was tall and burly, his right leg was disabled due to an injury and was thinner than his left leg, and the body had begun to rot. The People's Liberation Army has prepared a coffin and buried him, awaiting Zhang's family to come and claim the coffin and return it to his hometown. According to reports, Zhang Lingfu was 43 years old, a native of Chang'an, Shaanxi, and a graduate of the fourth class of the infantry department of the Baoding Military Academy. He served as a battalion, regiment, brigade commander, deputy division commander, division commander, deputy army commander, and army commander. He was violently tempered, worshiped Napoleon and Hitler, and had strict control over his subordinates. He was a trusted cadre loved by Chiang Kai-shek and a proud disciple cultivated by American imperialism. Now that the American-equipped and American-trained 74th Division has been completely annihilated, and Zhang Lingfu has not escaped, one wonders what Chiang and the Americans think?
　　
　　Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 23rd: Special correspondent Sima Long reports: Zhang Lingfu is dead. Speaking of Zhang Lingfu, there is an interlude. After Zhang Lingfu led the 74th Division to occupy Huaiyin at the cost of heavy casualties, the troops were scattered. He originally planned to go to Nanjing for reorganization. However, he was overwhelmed by Chiang Kai-shek's commendation order and said arrogantly: "We must take Lianshui first." When he ran into a hard nail under the city of Lianshui, he was greatly frustrated. So he said to those around him: "If we don't eliminate the Communist Party within a year, we will die without a burial place." This spring, the 74th Division entered Shandong from Jiangsu. Zhang Lingfu saw that Chiang's first rapid column, the 26th Division, and the 51st Division were successively annihilated in Lanling, Yixian, and Zaozhuang. Knowing that the situation was not good and wondering when it would be his turn, he pretended to be sick and asked Chiang Kai-shek for "poor health and a request for rest." But it was not approved. Zhang Lingfu did have some vision, and as expected, he died like a mangy dog. It's just that it wasn't a year but eight months (counting from last October when Zhang Lingfu said he would "die without a burial place"). The leaping development of the People's Liberation Army's strength has slightly revised Zhang Lingfu's estimate. As for "die without a burial place," it is unnecessarily worrying; because the People's Liberation Army, in accordance with the principle of broad-mindedness, has properly collected and buried him.

　　美械师长张灵甫死在美国武器下
    【新华社华东前线廿三日电】蒋介石嫡系精锐主力第一个美械师七十四师师长张灵甫，已为人民解放军手中的美国武器击毙。沂蒙山区孟良崮大歼灭战之第四天（十六日）当蒋军七十四师师部就歼时，张灵甫妄图突围逃生，人民解放军的美造汤姆机枪挡住了他的去路，弹中张氏后脑而死。尸首查出后，经被俘之该师辎重团上校团长黄政、五十八旅一七二团上校团长雷励群及张灵甫之侍从秘书张光第等人前往辨认，确证张氏后脑被汤姆枪弹炸烂，血与脑浆均已干涸，长方大脸鼻，梁高大，身体魁梧，右腿曾因伤残废，较左腿为细瘦，尸体已开始腐臭。人民解放军已备棺代为埋葬，以待张氏家属前来领柩回籍。按：张灵甫四十三岁，陕西长安人，保定军校第四期步兵科毕业，曾历任营、团、旅长、副师长、师长、副军长、军长等职，个性强暴，崇拜拿破仑、希特勒，对下管制甚严，为蒋介石所钟爱的心腹干部，亦为美帝国主义所喜爱培植的得意徒弟。如今美械美训之七十四师全军覆灭，张灵甫亦未能身免，不知蒋美作何感想？
    【新华社山东二十三日电】本社特派记者司马龙报导：张灵甫死了。提起张灵甫来，还有一段插曲。张灵甫率领七十四师以牺牲惨重的代价侵占淮阴后，部队七零八落，本拟去南京休整。但由于蒋介石的一纸嘉奖令，就此冲昏头脑，趾高气扬地说：“要拿下涟水再说。”至在涟水城下碰了硬钉子，大为懊丧。于是对他的左右说：“一年之内不消灭共产党，死无葬身之地。”今春七十四师由苏入鲁，张灵甫眼看到蒋军第一快速纵队二十六师、五十一师分别在兰陵、峄县、枣庄相继就歼，知道苗头不好，不知有那一天会轮到自己，因此假托生病，向蒋介石提出：“身体不好，要求休养。”但未批准。张灵甫毕竟有些眼光，果然不出所料，像癞皮狗一样地死了。只是不是一年而是八个月（从去年十月张灵甫说了“死无葬身之地”算起），人民解放军力量的飞跃发展，对张灵甫的估计略加修正。至于“死无葬身之地”云云，未免杞忧；因为人民解放军一本宽大为怀之旨，妥为收殓矣。
