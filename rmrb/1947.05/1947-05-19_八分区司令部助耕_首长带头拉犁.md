　　Eighth District Military Command Helps with Farming
    Commanders Take the Lead in Plowing
    [This newspaper, Jinan, 16th] The leaders of the Eighth District of Jinan investigated and found that military families, families of martyrs, the old, weak, and orphaned residing in the villages still had more than 70 mu of land that had not been plowed. Therefore, they convened a mobilization meeting of soldiers directly under the district a few days ago, calling for the organization of people and animals to fully help the masses with spring plowing. A total of three groups were formed. Commander Li and Deputy Director Wang of the district also joined the groups and took the lead in plowing. On the first day, the group of 16 people pulling plows by hand plowed more than five mu of land. Everyone said with confidence: "We will finish plowing the uncultivated land in the villages within three days."
    [This newspaper, Taihang News] In order to complete spring plowing and sowing ahead of schedule and fully support the front line, the Second Prefectural Commissioner's Office specially organized 16 laborers and one animal from the remaining organs (excluding those participating in the war in the countryside) to squeeze out time to cooperate with the masses to help military families without labor force to rush to sow. Currently, more than 70 loads of fertilizer have been carried, and four and a half mu of corn have been planted. (Xiu De, Zai Qing)
    [This newspaper, Jinan, 17th] More than 100 people from the First Recuperation Company directly under the Jinan Military Command helped the masses in the villages to sow 305 mu of cotton, and 50 mu of peanuts, beans, and melons within a week. Zhao Wenming, whose left arm was disabled, also planted three mu of cotton; He Wende, whose left leg was disabled, planted fifteen mu. Comrades with one leg, in order to make it easier to carry water, used a crutch and helped each other with other single-crutch comrades. Comrades with both hands disabled used their feet to cover the planting pits. All the comrades are still working hard to ensure that no land in the village is left uncultivated.
