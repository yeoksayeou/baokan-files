Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 27th: Desertion due to war-weariness is causing the ranks of Chiang Kai-shek's and Hu Zongnan's troops in northern Shaanxi to dwindle after several armed parades. According to liberated soldiers, from the attack on Yan'an to April 1st, the 9th Company of the 36th Regiment of the 12th Brigade decreased from 140 men to 80. The 7th Company of the 232nd Regiment of the 78th Brigade decreased from 180 to 80 men, and the 2nd Company of the 181st Regiment of the 61st Brigade decreased from 130 to 60 men. The reduction in personnel in these units ranged from 30% to 55.5%. The majority of these were desertions. In the battle of Yujiaping on April 19th, our unit captured a report from a company of the 368th Regiment of the 123rd Brigade, stating that both the company commander and deputy company commander were wounded, with a total of 7 dead and 12 wounded. However, 25 were missing (i.e., deserted), which is more than the total number of casualties. The only method used by Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan to prevent desertion is to stipulate that if any soldiers desert and leave behind their rifles and ammunition, they are not allowed to be turned in; instead, they must be carried by the members of the same squad. They hope to use this method to force soldiers to monitor each other. Squad leaders try to win over soldiers with emotional appeals, saying things like, "Wait until we return to Xi'an to desert; then we can even give you some travel expenses." But all this is useless. Carrying 60 to 70 jin of rifles, ammunition, and rations, parading through the mountains, sleeping in ditches, and suffering from cold and hunger, soldiers in Hu's army have no choice but to seek another way to survive. In late March alone, a small detachment of our army took in more than 40 stragglers and deserters. In the last ten days or so, another small detachment of our army has taken in more than 100 people. According to them, not only are soldiers deserting in Hu's army, but some officers are also not interested in armed parades. Before the 31st Brigade was annihilated, a deputy company commander and a warrant officer from the 3rd Battalion of its 52nd Regiment ran away.
Xinhua News Agency, Tongpu Railway Front, 26th: Frontline reporters report that the Yan Xishan occupied area along the Tongpu Railway is in extreme chaos and panic. Family members of Yan's troops in Pingyao, Jiexiu, and Hongdong are fleeing to Taiyuan and Xi'an. Trains are fully loaded with ammunition, food, and military supplies looted by Yan's puppet regime, retreating to Taiyuan. On the 14th of this month, Yan's puppet regime had already dismantled and burned the railway tracks and stations from Jiexiu to Yiquzhen. The main force of Yan's troops in Pingyao are fleeing north in a panic, leaving the "defense" to local police units and militia. These people are even more afraid of death, with more than 3,000 deserting in January alone. Taking in fleeing Yan's soldiers has become a heavy task for the democratic government along the Tongpu Railway. Even Quwo County has taken in more than 200 people in a few days. In order to save his dying fate, Yan Xishan has stipulated that all young students and strong men aged 17 to 45 must be conscripted and transported to Taiyuan to serve as soldiers. More than 200 young students from a middle school in Jiexiu City have been collectively enlisted. Everyone in the Yan occupied area is in danger and is fleeing to the liberated areas in groups. On the 14th and 15th alone, as many as 2,500 people fled to Wanghe and Shuimotou villages in Qin source. The democratic government has provided them with resettlement and relief.

　　蒋军士兵厌战日深纷纷逃来我解放区
    【新华社西北二十七日电】厌战逃亡的减员，使蒋胡军在陕北几次武装大游行的行列愈来愈短。根据解放士兵所谈：从进攻延安到四月一日止，其十二旅三十六团的第九连，由一百四十人减到八十人。七十八旅二三二团的第七连由一百八十减到八十人，六十一旅一八一团的第二连由一百三十人减到六十人。以上各单位减员达百分之三十至百分之五十五点五。其中大部分系开小差。我某部在四月十九日余家坪战斗中，缴获一二三旅三六八团某连的报告，说该连正副连长均负伤，共亡七名伤十二名。而失踪（即开小差）二十五名，比伤亡的总和还要多。蒋胡防止逃亡的唯一办法，是规定各班如有逃亡丢下的枪弹不准往上交，由本班的人背上走。想用此法逼使士兵互相监视。班长则用感情拉拢士兵，如说：“等回到西安再开小差，那时还可送一点路费。”但都无用。因背负枪弹粮秣六七十斤，游行大山，露宿沟渠，挨冻受饿的种种苦差，使胡军士兵不得不另找生路。仅三月底我军某小队收容掉队落伍开小差者皆有四十余名，最近十来天我军另一小队又收容百人以上。据他们谈：胡军中不仅士兵逃亡，某些军官也对武装游行不感兴趣，三十一旅被歼前，其五十二团第三营跑了一个副连长和一个准尉。
    【新华社同蒲沿线二十六日电】前线记者报导：同蒲沿线阎占区陷于极度混乱恐慌中。平遥、介休、洪洞阎军军官眷属纷纷向太原、西安逃亡，火车满载阎伪抢劫的子弹、食粮及军用杂物，向太原溃退。本月十四日阎伪已将介休至义渠镇之铁轨及车站自动拆除烧毁。平遥阎军主力仓惶北撤，把“防务”交给地方警团。这些人更怕死，一月中逃亡在三千人以上。收容阎军逃亡士兵已成同蒲沿线民主政府一繁重工作。连曲沃一县数日内即收容二百余人。阎锡山为挽救其垂死命运，规定凡十七至四十五岁的青年学生及壮丁均得被抓运太原当兵。介休城内某中学二百余青年学生已被集体编兵，阎占区人人自危，成群向解放区逃亡。仅十四、十五两日逃到沁源王和、水磨头等村者已达两千五百余人。民主政府均予以安插和救济。
