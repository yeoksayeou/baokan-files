　　Millet Sown During Lesser Fullness, Cotton Blossoms During Start of Summer – No Longer Waiting for Rain, Not Relying on Heaven
    Various Regions Rush to Plant
    Jinnan Daily Staff Help Local Masses Plant Cotton

    [Our Newspaper, Licheng News] In order to break the wait-and-see mentality, Beifang Village in the First District launched a crash planting of cotton. On the 3rd of this month, a cadre meeting was held to discuss how to complete the cotton planting plan. Labor Hero Cui Hailing said, "I had a wait-and-see attitude for the past two days, thinking the solar term was still early and it would rain. I was just waiting without moving. Now, the longer we wait, the higher the sky gets (meaning no rain), and we have to hurry up and plant! If we delay a few more days, we won't be able to plant." Public Security Director Jin Naigou said, "To complete the cotton planting, the main thing is to rely on us to speak up. If we can take active action, the masses will not be a problem; conversely, if we only talk and don't act, the masses will also become a problem." After a heated debate, the understanding became clearer. They also studied cotton planting techniques and listed the benefits of starting cotton planting early: First, high yield, early boll splitting, and early plowing of the land. Delaying it results in low yield, late boll splitting, and no plowing. Second, evenly emerged cotton seedlings and vigorous growth. Third, it saves water during planting and is easy to emerge. A plan was drawn up to complete the cotton planting: the whole village has twenty-eight livestock and thirty-four male laborers; twenty children and twenty-four old men must also participate. Distant and nearby lands are allocated evenly, with two laborers planting one mu. Thirty mu can be planted in one day. The total cotton field area of the village is one hundred and forty mu and five fen, and it will be completed in five days starting from the 4th. Each team challenges each other to strive for early completion. The whole village is now implementing large-scale labor exchange, with some plowing, some planting, and some carrying water, and no one is idle. Also: The labor hero He Kaoxian Brigade in Beiliuji base point, Nanbu Village, is carrying water to plant cotton, and has planted thirteen mu in three days. Under the leadership of his team, the whole village is actively preparing for planting, no longer sitting and waiting for rain. The masses in Longwang Village are seizing the gap in production to repair canals, which will be completed in three more days, and can irrigate more than seven qing of cotton fields.

    [Our Newspaper, Jinnan, 8th Dispatch] Zhao Laoxiang and others in Xuguzhai Village, Weixian County, are determined to "man will conquer nature" and are carrying water to plant cotton. Their experience is that the planting should be shallow, and the seedlings will emerge in three days and are drought-resistant. He said, "See the seedlings for thirty percent of the harvest. You have to sweat more. Relying on heaven is useless. If you rely on it until "Lesser Fullness," the cotton will not return home." Under his influence, many people in the village are preparing to plant with water. According to cotton planting veteran Shi Lao Ji, "In the eighth year of the Republic of China, I planted cotton and harvested one hundred and forty jin per mu. Others relied on rain, and the seeds were sown during Lesser Fullness, yielding only twenty jin per mu. In the twenty-third and thirty-third years, I planted cotton, and the cotton seedlings were lush, and the bolls were dense, yielding more than one hundred jin per mu." The whole village is now brewing: "The Yang family generals, all go up together," to plant the cotton early to prevent spring drought.
    [Another Dispatch] Jinnan Daily published a short commentary calling for carrying water to plant, prevent drought, and prepare for famine. At the same time, under the personal leadership of Director Mo, all staff of the newspaper and the Jinnan Xinhua Branch give water for planting cotton to the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers in the resident area in the afternoon after work. All employees are vying to carry water, dig pits, plant seeds, and pile up soil, with high enthusiasm.

　　小满谷子立夏花不再等雨不靠天
    各地纷纷突击点种
    冀南日报职工帮助驻地群众点棉
    【本报黎城讯】一区北坊村为打破等待思想，突击栽棉，于本月三日召开干部会议，讨论如何完成种棉计划。劳英崔海令说：“前两天我还存着等待思想，以为节令还早哩，天还要下雨，光等不动。现在是越等天越高（不下雨意思），赶快得栽哩，再迟几天就栽不上了。”公安主任靳乃狗说：“要想完成栽棉，主要就是靠咱们这伙人说话，如果咱们能积极行动起来，群众是不成问题的；相反，如果我们光说不动，群众也就成问题。”经过热烈争论，思想上才更明确起来。又研究了栽棉技术，列举了早动手点棉的好处：一、产量大，裂桃早，垡地早。迟了产量少，裂桃迟，还不能垡地。二、栽的棉出的齐，苗发旺。三、现在趁垧省水，好出。并订出完成栽棉计划：全村二十八个牲口，三十四个男劳力；儿童二十人，老汉二十四人也都要参加。远近地平均开，用两个工栽一亩，一天能栽三十亩，全村花地一百四十亩五分，从四号起五天完成。各队互相挑战，争取提前完成。现在全村实行大变工，耕的耕，栽的栽，担水的担水，没有一个闲人。又：北流基点南堡村劳动英雄何考贤大队，担水点棉，三天已种十三亩。在他队的带头下，全村都在积极准备点种，不再坐等下雨。隆旺村群众抓紧生产空隙修渠，再有三天即可竣工，可以浇棉田七顷多。（建熊、丕义、东魁、渐清）
    【本报冀南八日电】威县徐固寨村赵老香等以“人定胜天”的决心，挑水点种棉花。他们的经验是栽的要浅，三天就可出苗，苗亦耐旱。他说：“见苗三分收，要多流点汗，靠天不济事，靠来靠去到了“小满”，花就不归家了。”在他的影响下，村中很多人都准备用水点种。据点种棉花的老手石老济谈：“民国八年点种棉花，一亩地收了一百四十斤，别人靠天雨，都是小满时播的种，每亩仅合二十多斤。二十三、三十三年他都点种过棉花，花苗又茂盛，桃又密，每亩都在百斤以上。”现全村正在酝酿：“杨家将，一齐上”，早把花点种上，以防春旱。
    【又电】冀南日报发表短论，号召担水点种，防旱备荒。同时报社与冀南新华分社全体人员，在莫社长亲自领导下，每日下午工作余暇，给驻地烈工属担水点棉。全体职工争先担水、刨坑、点籽、屯土，情绪很高。
