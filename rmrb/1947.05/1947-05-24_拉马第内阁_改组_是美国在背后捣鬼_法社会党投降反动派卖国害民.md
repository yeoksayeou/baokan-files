Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th: TASS Moscow dispatch: The "Pravda" recently published an article stating: World opinion justly believes that the "reorganization" of the Ramadier cabinet is an automatic surrender of the ministers of the French Socialist Party to the right-wing parties. The details of the artificial government crisis in France (which is now being copied in Italy) are becoming clearer, and the appearance of the current political situation is becoming more obvious. The French Socialist Party's automatic surrender to domestic reactionary forces and the exclusion of the Communist Party ministers not only rudely disregard the will of all voters, but also express their "interpretation" of the recently adopted democratic constitution with a non-democratic de Gaulle consciousness. This also means taking an important step towards abandoning national sovereignty and subordinating France's national interests to the orders of foreign monopolists. The methods of the American monopolists' blatant interference in French internal affairs—and not just French internal affairs—are quite straightforward. "Replace those we don't like, abandon independent policies, and then we'll give you gold coins," that's the essence of what these monopolists demand. Therefore, it is not surprising that one of the direct results of the change in the Ramadier cabinet is that the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development is granting France a 30-year loan of 250 million US dollars. "Pravda" concluded: Thus, we have obtained another valuable explanation of the American concept of "democracy" and a secret of how they save this "democracy"; this secret is to completely disregard the will of the nations freely expressed under the constitution. At the same time, "independent democratic government" translated into American means a government that violates the will of the voters, violates the people and their national interests and the constitution. Clearly, the "democratic" nature of such a government is measured here by different standards—by its dependence on the will of the trusts and cartels, and by its dependence on the will of the Wall Street tycoons.

　　拉马第内阁“改组”是美国在背后捣鬼           
    法社会党投降反动派卖国害民
    【新华社陕北二十日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报顷著文称：世界舆论公正的认为拉马第内阁的“改组”是法国社会党各部长向右冀各政党自动的投降。法国人为的政府危机（目前也在意大利如法泡制）的详情愈显露，目前政局发展的外貌也就愈明朗。法国社会党向国内反动势力之自动投降及共产党的各部长的被排除，不仅粗鲁的藐视了全体选民的意志，而且也表示了他们以非民主的戴高乐的意识对最近通过的民主宪法所作的“解释”，这也意味着走向放弃国家主权和把法国的国家利益服从于外国垄断家之命令的重要的一步。美国垄断家对法国内政——而且不仅是法国一国的内政——粗暴干涉的手法，是颇为率直的。“撤换那些我们不喜欢的人，放弃独立政策，然后我们就给你金元”，这便是这些垄断家们要求的要点。因此，拉马第内阁变动后的直接结果之一，即国际建设开展银行正给予法国为期三十年的二万万五千万美元贷款，这并不是值得惊奇的。真理报结论称：于是，我们又获得了一个对美国“民主”概念的有价值的解释和一个他们如何挽救这种“民主”的秘诀；这一秘诀便是完全不顾各民族根据宪法自由表现的意志。而同时“独立民主的政府”翻译成美国话，意思就是违反选民意志，违反人民和他们的民族利益与宪法的政府。很清楚地，这种政府的“民主”性质，在这里是以不同的标准来衡量——以对托拉斯，卡迭尔之意志的依赖来衡量，以对华尔街大亨们之意志的依赖来衡量。
