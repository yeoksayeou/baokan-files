【This dispatch from the North Henan Front, May 11th】Frontline reporter Wu Xiang reports: Villagers inside Hua County discovered a new pit in the backyard of the KMT county government. Thinking it contained buried ammunition and supplies, they led soldiers to dig it up. After digging only a foot and a half deep, they were stunned. It turned out that the hoe had hit a human head. When the Jiang troops occupied Hua County, they arrested so-called unstable elements on a large scale, but dared not announce their "crimes." They often secretly dragged them to the wilderness north of the city and executed them at night. Residents of West Street and North Street could see flashes of electricity and hear the victims' miserable screams almost every night. The Jiang troops fled in such a hurry this time that they didn't have time to transport the remaining thirty-odd "prisoners" out of the city and buried them alive inside the puppet county government. The news quickly spread throughout the city, and relatives came in twos and threes to identify the bodies. Jia Wenyi, the deputy director of the Chengguan District Farmers' Association, pale and trembling, forcefully dragged the leg of a corpse with both hands. She hoped to pull out her own man, but even more hoped it wasn't, fantasizing that her man was still alive somewhere. She has four children, the oldest girl is only ten years old, and the youngest is only two months old. How has she been able to endure these difficult days? I really didn't have the courage to ask her. The corpse was finally pulled out, completely naked, with a bloody and blurred face. There were many bricks beside it, indicating that this martyr had resisted with all his might when he was martyred, and the executioners pushed him into the pit and smashed him hard with bricks and tiles. This poor woman found a scar on the back of the corpse's head and immediately fainted into the pile of corpses. Two old men searching for their sons silently carried her out. At this moment, the people's soldiers shed tears of grief and indignation, vowing to the martyrs' families: "We will catch these bastards and bite them to death alive."

　　蒋军在滑县血腥屠杀
    【本报豫北前线十一日电】前线记者吴象报导：滑县城内的老乡们在蒋记县府后院里，发现了一个新坑，以为埋藏的是弹药物资，领着战士们去刨，刨了一尺半深，人们都怔住了。原来镢头碰到了人头。蒋军盘踞滑县的时候，大捕所谓不稳分子，又不敢公布他们的“罪名”，常常在深夜里拉到城北荒地里秘密处死。西街北街的居民几乎每夜都可看到一闪闪的电光，听到被难者凄厉的惨叫。蒋军这次逃跑得太仓皇，剩下的三十几个“囚犯”来不及运到城外去，就在伪县政府内活埋了。消息很快传遍全城，认尸的家属三三两两的跑了来，把坑掘开，里面堆满横七竖八的尸首。城关区农会副主任贾文义的老婆面黄如纸颤栗的两只手用力拖着一个尸首的腿，她希望拉的就是自己的男人，但更希望不是，她幻想自己的男人还意外的活在人间。她有四个小孩，最大的女孩才十岁，最小的才两个月，这些苦难的日子是怎样支持过来的？我真没有勇气去问她。尸首终于拉出来了，全身精光，脸部血肉模糊。身旁有许多砖块，显示这位烈士殉难时曾全力反抗，刽子手把他推到坑里，又狠狠的用砖瓦砸他。这个可怜的女人在尸首后脑上找到一个疤痕，立刻昏倒在尸堆里。两个寻找儿子的老汉，默默无声的把她抬了出来。人民的战士们这时都悲愤的滚下热泪，他们向烈属们发誓：“抓住这些龟孙子，要活活咬死他。”
