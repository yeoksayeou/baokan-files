Asked: "Have you read Mr. Wallace's speech? Can you share some opinions?" Answered: "Mr. Wallace, as an American democrat, is quite popular with audiences in Yugoslavia.

    杜鲁门关于希土的演说  不能影响南国外交政策
    【新华社陕北一日电】法国新闻社讯：南斯拉夫唐纳格通讯社二十六日宣布：南国总统铁托元帅顷接见美国评论记者斯蒂尔，并回答若干问题。问：“杜鲁门总统关于希土的多次演说，是否影响南国的外交政策？”答：“美国总统的演说并未使我们惊奇。无论如何，杜鲁门总统的演说不能影响我们的外交政策。”问：“阁下怎样预测南国与希腊及土耳其间将来的关系？”答：“并不很乐观。”谈到南国与美国间的关系时，铁托元帅称：“我并未清楚的看出，两国间的关系在最近的将来是否有巨大改进的可能。”问：“阁下对克伦地亚问题在联合国机构中讨论，有何意见？”答：“如果有人把这问题交付联合国机构讨论，那是因为他们认为在那里解决将于南国不利，我对这是不满意的。”铁托元帅承认国内情况是困难的，并称：“我们觉得我们一定要克服这些困难，这或者有赖于向国外的购买。”问：“阁下读了华莱士先生的演说吗？可否以若干意见相告？”答：“做为一个美国民主人士的华莱士先生，在南国是颇受听众欢迎的，我们喜欢听取客观人士的发言。我个人对他的演说大部同意。”
