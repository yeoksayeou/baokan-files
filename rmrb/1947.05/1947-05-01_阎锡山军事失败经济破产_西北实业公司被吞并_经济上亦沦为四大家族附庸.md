Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 28th: Yan Xishan's Northwest Industrial Company, which he had operated for many years by exploiting the wealth of the people of Shanxi, was completely mortgaged to Chiang Kai-shek's Bank of China in early April for the price of 700 billion yuan. From then on, Yan Xishan became an economic appendage of the four major families. The company was Yan Xishan's general organ for producing war materials for the civil war and monopolizing Shanxi's industry. After the Japanese surrender, it also "preserved on behalf of" the industries left behind by the Japanese invaders. Its heavy industries included the nationally famous Taiyuan Arsenal, as well as steel plants, machinery factories, and railway factories. Light industries included Jin Sheng Textile Factory, Northwest Cement Plant, Northwest Flour Company, Northwest Match Factory, and Jinhua Cigarette Company. Recently, due to Yan Xishan's military failure, the economic bankruptcy of his controlled areas, the oppression of American goods dumping, the lack of raw materials, and the sluggish sales of finished products, the company suffered huge losses, and the four major families took the opportunity to swallow it up. The company's light industrial plants have long been in a semi-closed state. Yan Xishan's plan of "light industry making money to subsidize heavy industry to produce military supplies" has long been shattered. The same is true for heavy industry. For example, of the four steel-making furnaces in the steel plant, only one remains, and it has been converted to cast pig iron and manufacture guns. A large number of employees have been laid off. The railway factory, which once had 5,000 employees, has been reduced by two-thirds. Almost all the employees of the Jinhua Cigarette Company have been laid off. The remaining nearly 10,000 workers have been completely incorporated into the "standing army" from the "military-industrial integration," forcing them to serve as cannon fodder in the civil war.

　　阎锡山军事失败经济破产
    西北实业公司被吞并
    经济上亦沦为四大家族附庸
    【新华社晋绥二十八日电】阎锡山盘剥山西民脂民膏经营多年之西北实业公司，已于四月初以七千亿元之代价，全部押给蒋记中国银行。从此阎锡山在经济上成为四大家族之附庸。该公司系阎锡山用以生产内战军火及垄断山西工业的总机关。日寇投降后，又“代为保存”日寇遗留的工业。其重工业有全国著名之太原兵工厂，以及炼钢厂、机器厂、铁道工厂等。轻工业有晋生纺织厂、西北洋灰厂、西北面粉公司、西北火柴厂、晋华卷烟公司等。近因阎锡山军事失败，其统治区经济破产，美货倾销压迫，原料缺乏，成品滞销，该公司赔累甚巨，四大家族乃乘机吞并。该公司之轻工业各厂，久处半关闭状态。阎锡山的“轻工业赚钱补助重工业生产军火”的计划，早成泡影。重工业方面亦如是，如炼钢厂的四座炼钢炉，只剩一座，改铸生铁、造枪支。大批职工被裁失业，曾拥有五千职工之铁道工厂已减去三分之二。晋华卷烟公司职工几乎全部裁完，剩余之近万工人，已从“兵工合一”进而全被编为“常备兵”，迫使彼等充当内战炮灰。
