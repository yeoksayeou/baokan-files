　　Experiences in Adjusting Cadre-Masses Relations in the Old Liberated Area of Wu'an
    Wang Tingdong
    At the end of April, the Wu'an County Party Committee convened 300 district and village cadres from the old liberated areas to discuss the People's Daily editorial "A Salute to District and Village Cadres" of April 23. Combining this with a review of the "movement" for cadre-masses unity since April, they initially summarized twelve points of experience:

    1.  It is essential to boldly trust and give authority to truly honest farm laborers and poor peasants, and their foundation must be firm. In some places, failing to distinguish between honest poor and farm laborers and rogue, sharp-tongued elements at the beginning, and mobilizing them indiscriminately, was wrong.

    2. The branch should first be mobilized to take the initiative in leading the knot-untangling movement and unite with upright poor and farm laborers to form the leadership core. Suddenly mobilizing the masses to offer opinions to cadres, or standing above the cadres and masses and ordering cadre-masses unity, is wrong.

    3. It is necessary to affirm and acknowledge the legitimacy of cadres and masses turning the tables and becoming prosperous in the double reduction movement and production movement, and to consolidate their vested interests. In some villages, saying that cadres became rich in the rent reduction movement by "grabbing a handful" and forcing cadres to "return the fruits" is wrong.

    4. Treating knot-untangling as a struggle, or using attitudes and habitual methods of struggling against feudalism to a greater or lesser extent towards cadres with shortcomings, is wrong.

    5. The leadership must share the responsibility for certain shortcomings of cadres, and use the exemplary role of the leadership's self-criticism to inspire cadres to become aware. The branch leadership should also make self-criticism for the shortcomings of individual party members, and should not push all the mistakes onto one or two comrades.

    6. Knot-untangling should be combined with comparing progress to mobilize "backward" masses. If the masses' certain backwardness is mixed up with the cadres' shortcomings, it will have the side effect of "rewarding" backwardness.

    7. Treat cadre-masses unity as part of peasant unity. Between cadres, between advanced and "backward" elements, between masses, between poor and farm laborers and middle peasants, between old and new activists, between peasant men and women, between party members and the masses, between branches and various systems, and within families, call on everyone to untangle their knots, creating a large-scale unity movement. In some villages, simply raising opinions about cadres allows rogue, sharp-tongued elements to exploit loopholes, or creates sectarian retaliation, which is wrong.

    8. Educate honest peasants to learn to manage their affairs and speak the truth, and help cadres to fairly untangle knots and be good at distinguishing right from wrong. Some villages' mass organizations have a "Guarantee Committee" that has grasped the principle of unity and mediation, which is a good experience.

    9. Only publicizing cadres' shortcomings and not publicizing their merits, treating the evaluation of merits as a way to improve cadres' emotions, or simply letting the masses evaluate cadres' merits, is not good. A mass movement to recognize and commend meritorious service should be launched from the bottom up, starting from summarizing the land reform, and become a major part of the conscious unity movement.

    10. Adjusting cadre-masses relations should serve the current movement. In some villages, the purpose of adjusting cadre-masses relations has been blurred, endlessly "digging up old scores," delaying time, and trying to solve all the peasants' sectarian selfishness in ten days and a half, achieving a permanent solution, which is harmful.

    11. Treating "attitude" as the main criterion for evaluating cadres, regarding cadres who are inoffensive and conciliatory with no stance as good cadres, while regarding cadres who are resolute in struggle, do not show affection, complete tasks, do not compromise, but sometimes have a slightly bad attitude, as bad cadres, is still wrong. The standards for good cadres must be clarified in the leadership's thinking and the masses' thinking.

    12. A new atmosphere of loving the people and respecting cadres should be created in the process of untangling knots and comparing progress, and cadre-masses unity should be made regular. Any activities by landlords to sow discord among the peasants should be crushed.

　　武安老区调整干群关系经验
    王庭栋
    武安县委于四月底召集老区区村干部三百人，讨论人民日报四月二十三日“向区村干部致敬”的社论，连系检讨四月以来的干群团结“运动”，初步总结经验十二条：
    一、必须放手给真正老实雇贫，根要坐正。有的地方，开始没分别老实贫雇与流氓尖头分子，混同发动是不对的。
    二、应当首先发动支部，主动的领导解圪瘩运动，并团结正派贫雇农组成领导核心。突然发动群众给干部提意见，或站在干部群众上面，命令干群团结的作法是不对的。
    三、应当肯定承认干部群众在双减运动、生产运动中翻身发家的合法，并巩固其既得利益。有的村子说干部在减租运动中发家都是“抓一把”，迫着干部“退果实”是不对的。
    四、把解圪瘩当作起斗争，或多或少的用些斗封建的态度习惯方式来对待有缺点的干部是不对的。
    五、对于干部的某些缺点，领导上必须分担责任，以领导上自我批评的模范作用启发干部自觉。对于个别党员的缺点，支部领导上也应作检讨，不该把一些错误都推到一、二个同志身上。
    六、应当把解圪瘩与比进步结合，才能发动“落后”群众。如果把群众的某些落后与干部缺点混起来，就会起“奖励”落后的副作用。
    七、把干群团结作为农民团结的一部分，干部与干部间，先进与“落后”间，群众与群众间，贫雇与中农间，老新积极分子间，农民男女间，党员与群众间，支部与各系统间，家庭间，号召谁有圪瘩都要解，造成大规模的团结运动。有的村单纯提干部的意见，被流氓尖头分子钻空，或造成宗派报复是不对的。
    八、教育老实农民学会当家说真理，帮助干部公平解圪瘩善于分辨是非，有的村群众组织“保证委员会”，掌握了团结调解方针，是很好的经验。
    九、只宣传干部缺点，不宣传干部功劳，把评功当作是提高干部情绪的方针，或单纯让群众给干部评功，这是不好的。应当自下而上的从总结土地改革中开展群众立功表模运动，成为自觉团结运动的主要部分。
    十、调整干群关系应服务于当前运动，有的村模糊了调整干群关系的目的，无限止的“翻老账”，拖延时间，想把农民的一切宗派自私，在十天半月中突击解决，一劳永逸这是有害处的。
    十一、把“态度”好坏，当作鉴定干部的主要条件，把不惹人的调和主义的没立场的干部，当作好干部，而把斗争坚决不讲情面，完成任务，不打折扣，只是有时态度稍有不好的干部认为是坏干部，还是不对的，必须在领导思想与群众思想中明确好干部的标准。
    十二、应当在解圪瘩比进步中，造成爱民尊干的新风气，把干群团结经常化。并把地主任何挑拨农民团结的活动打垮。
