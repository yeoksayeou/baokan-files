Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: The Shanghai Ta Kung Pao reported on April 24th: The people's armed forces, which are widespread in more than ten counties and cities in southern Guangdong, including Zhanjiang, Lianjiang, Hua County, Wuchuan, and Suixi, number about six to seven thousand. The Chiang Kai-shek local armed security forces are no match for them. People's governments have been established in Lianjiang and Hua County, controlling vast rural areas. Their momentum is enormous. The Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters convened a "Public Security Symposium" in mid-April but could only dispatch a battalion from the reorganized 69th Division to "suppress" them. In addition, the people's armed forces are also active in the Wushe, Shentan, Zhongyiqiao, and Shifeng areas of the Guangdong-Jiangxi-Fujian border region, disrupting traffic in the three provinces from time to time. The magistrates of Meixian and Jiaoling counties were given a major demerit by the Chiang Kai-shek Guangdong Provincial Government for "ineffective bandit suppression," and the inspectors of the two counties were all dismissed. Furthermore, the Zhang Yan's troops, active in the southern Guangdong area, are increasing in strength daily. Months ago, they moved into Guangxi and captured Rong County. The Chiang government is at a loss on how to deal with them. (Note: Zhang Yan was originally a division commander of the 19th Route Army. Due to persecution by Chiang Kai-shek, he led his troops to resist Chiang in the local area for many years.)

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: Shanghai News: The people's armed forces in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui are growing stronger daily. Local party secretaries' self-defense teams and township offices are often surrounded and disarmed. At the end of February, more than ten sophisticated weapons, including carbines and machine guns, belonging to the Chiang Kai-shek self-defense team in Hangtou Town, a suburb of Shanghai, were seized by the people's armed forces active in Pudong. On March 19th, the Jiangnan People's Militia killed the notorious bandit Chen Xiaoping, in Wenzu Town, Jiangyin, in a restaurant. (During the Anti-Japanese War, this bandit preyed on the people in the Wuxi and Jiangyin areas. After Japan's surrender, he served as the leader of the "Wuxi-Shanghai Joint Defense Office" of the Chiang Kai-shek party.) Due to the intense activity of the people's armed forces, the Chiang Kai-shek township heads and Baojia chiefs in Huangtutang, Donghuqiao, and Diaotuqiao areas in northern Wuxi have fled. On March 5th, the Jingzhong Township Office in Yuyao, eastern Zhejiang, was suddenly surrounded by 40 militiamen, who seized seven rifles and pistols and more than 500 rounds of ammunition. At the end of March, the Chiang Kai-shek self-defense team in Taopu Township, Siming District, Ningbo, was surrounded by the militia, and six rifles were seized. At the end of April, more than 300 members of the people's armed forces in Jingxian County, southern Anhui, successively rushed into Zhangdu Town and surrounded the Maolin Town Office, taking all the rifles from both locations.

　　粤桂边民变军势力日张
    张炎部攻占容县城
    苏浙皖民军屡缴蒋家枪械
    【新华社陕北十六日电】四月二十四日沪大公报载：遍及粤南湛江、廉江、化县、吴川、遂溪等十余县市之民变武装约六七千人，蒋记地方武装保安队已非其敌手，廉江、化县两县并已成立人民政府。控制广大农村，声势浩大，广州行辕于四月中旬特召开“治安座谈会”，但仅能派出整六十九师一个营前往“会剿”。又粤赣闽边区五设、神坛、忠义桥、石峰一带民变武装亦活跃，三省交通时受阻隔，梅县焦岭两县长因“防匪不力”，被蒋记广东省府记大过一次，该两县巡官均被撤职。又：活跃于广东南路一带之张炎部队，势力日大，月前更转入桂境，攻占容县，蒋政府对其已束于无策。（按张炎原系十九路军师长，以被蒋介石迫害，乃率其部从于当地抗蒋多年。）
    【新华社陕北十六日电】沪讯：苏浙皖民变武装日趋壮大，各地书记自卫队、乡镇公所辄遭包围缴械。二月底，沪郊市区航头镇蒋自卫队之卡宾、快机等精良武器十余支，均为活跃浦东之民变武装缴去。三月十九日，江南民军于江阴文祖镇一菜馆内击毙苏南著名顽匪陈逆宵平。（该逆抗战期内在无锡、江阴一带鱼肉人民，日本投降后，任蒋党“锡沪联防处”组长。）无锡北乡黄土塘、东湖桥、吊土桥一带蒋记之乡镇保甲长，因民变武装活动甚烈，逃避一空。浙东余姚精忠乡公所，于三月五日突遭民军四十人包围，被缴去长短枪七支，子弹五百余发。宁波四明区桃浦乡蒋自卫队，于三月底遭民军包围，被缴去步枪六支。皖南泾县民变武装三百余人，四月底先后冲入章渡镇，包围茂林镇公所，将两处步枪悉数携去。
