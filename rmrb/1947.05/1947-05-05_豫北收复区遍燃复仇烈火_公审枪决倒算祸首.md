　　Northern Henan Recovered Area Ablaze with Revenge
    Public Trial and Execution of Counter-Settlement Masterminds
    [This Dispatch from Taihang, May 3rd] In the newly liberated areas of Northern Henan, people's movements against traitors and for revenge, as well as movements against counter-settlement, are being successively launched. On April 15th, the Fourth District of Wuzhi held a mass rally of more than 2,000 people in Xiaodong Town to commemorate the martyred compatriots who were brutally killed by the Chiang Kai-shek puppet traitors and local despots, and to publicly try Yang Shifa, the ringleader of the counter-settlement. This traitor had served as a bao chief for many years during the Japanese occupation. When the Chiang Kai-shek puppets occupied our Wuzhi last year, he actively organized the puppet "Self-Defense Corps" and "Returning Home Corps," cruelly carrying out counter-settlement and committing all kinds of evil deeds. During the speaking bitterness sessions, the masses listed the traitor's crimes: 1. Murdering more than 20 people, including Yang Xinghan, who actively resisted Japan and led the emancipation, and their families. 2. In addition to forcing the masses to give up all the fruits of emancipation, he looted more than 100 shi of grain and many other things. 3. Digging up the coffins of two of our sacrificed soldiers, abandoning the corpses, and selling the coffins. Finally, County Magistrate Yang accepted the people's demands and, on behalf of the government, sentenced the traitor to death. After the recovery of Tangyin Hewei Town, the masses, while demolishing fortifications, brewed bitterness, and on the 18th, convened a mass rally of more than 1,000 people to publicly try and execute Wang Xian, the head of the Returning Home Corps. Now, the masses shouted in unison: "The sun is shining again! We must support the front lines well and eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek army!"
    [This Dispatch from Taihang, May 3rd] In Anyang Lunzhang, the "Returning Home Corps," during its five months of demonic rule, buried alive hundreds of good people. Since the "Returning Home Corps" arrived in Lunzhang on October 18th last year, pedestrians were prohibited as soon as night fell. Around the Yang family's old graves outside the village, there were individual long pits, piles of loose soil, and everywhere in the wheat fields and weeds were pieces of clothing stained with blood. Since last year, investigations have revealed that there are six people who were eaten by dogs and whose names are known. After liberation on April 21st, two dogs were fighting over a skull. People chased the dogs away and came forward to identify it. They all said that this was probably the head of Li Guocai. People recalled that Li Guocai was hanged and beaten several times in the village, but he always cursed more the more he was beaten. He said to the murderers: "I am an old Eighth Route soldier! The Eighth Route Army will not die, and I will not die either. If I die, my son will still be an Eighth Route soldier!" After he died, his wife was in confinement, and soon died of grief, leaving behind only a six-year-old orphan named Xiaobao. On April 22nd, Lunzhang joint defense cadres and the masses carried coffins to exhume the bodies of the victims. The first to be exhumed were Yao Lizhi's two brothers. The bodies had become semi-liquid and could not be coffined. Yao Lizhi's eyes, nose, and two ears were cut off, and a piece of flesh was cut off his arm. There was a tree close to the edge of the pit, and the bark of the tree was stained with purple blood. Yao Lizhi was tied to this tree and brutally murdered. While exhuming and identifying the bodies, Li Heinu's (female) mother came to look for Heinu, carrying a quilt. Wei Qingfeng's niece from Zhongle Village came to look for Wei Qingfeng, and Cui Quanyou's mother from Xilu Village also came to look for her son. But none of them found a complete corpse. Wang Heicheng from Nan'ya Village said: "I almost got buried alive! Everyone in Lunzhang knows that I, Heichengzi, have been a farmhand all my life and have a single household. On November 30th last year, people said that I had struggled against Yang Shufeng, and they hung me and beat me in the bao chief's bureau, almost to death. They insisted on burying me alive. Later, Yang Shuxue, Yang Shugui, Yang Laiquan, and others knelt in the bao office to save me. I spent one shi, eight dou, and four sheng of rice to buy nine mu and two fen of land, and this time it was all taken away by others, and two shi of grain was confiscated, leaving only a few sheng of grain." He is now complaining to everyone and is filled with vengeful anger. More than 30 people who were buried alive have been found, and dozens more are missing. The murderers of this massacre are: Guo Jikui and Yao Denong, the puppet Lunzhang township's chief and deputy chiefs; Liang Yuechao, the puppet captain; and the traitorous despotic landlords Zhang Yuebo, Chang Shuzhi, and Yang Nanguan. The Lunzhang masses are currently settling this blood debt, and they have shouted the slogan "Avenge the martyred brothers!"

　　豫北收复区遍燃复仇烈火
    公审枪决倒算祸首
    【本报太行三日电】豫北重获解放之新区，人民反奸复仇及反倒算运动相继开展。武陟四区于四月十五日在小东镇召开二千余人的群众大会，追悼被蒋伪奸霸残杀之死难同胞，公审倒算头子杨世法。该逆在日寇时代即任保长多年，去年蒋伪进占我武陟时，又积极组织伪“自卫团”及“还乡团”，残酷倒算，无恶不作，群众于诉苦中，列举该逆之罪状：一、杀害积极抗日及领导翻身之杨兴汉等及其家属二十余人。二、除逼迫群众全部退出翻身果实外，抢掠粮食一百余石及其他东西甚多。三、刨出我牺牲战士之棺材两个，抛弃死尸，售卖棺材。最后由该县杨县长接受人民要求，代表政府将该逆判以死刑。汤阴鹤璧镇于收复后，群众在拆毁工事中，即酝酿诉苦，十八日召集了一千余人的群众大会，公审枪决还乡团团长王宪，今后群众齐声嚷嚷：“现在又露出了晴天！可得好好支援前线，把蒋军消灭掉！”
    【本报太行三日电】安阳伦掌“还乡团”在其五个月的恶魔统治内，活埋了上百个善良的人民，自去年十月十八日“还乡团”到伦掌以后，一到夜晚，就禁止行人。村边杨家老坟周围，个个的长坑，一堆堆的虚土，麦垅间，荒草里，到处是血迹斑斑的衣裳片。从去年到现在，调查出有名有姓被狗吃掉的就有六个。四月二十一日解放后，两只狗抢吃一个骷髅，人们把狗赶跑了，上前认了认，都说这大概是李国材的头。人们回忆李国材在寨上被吊打了几次，总是越打越骂，他向凶手们说：“老子就是老八路！八路军不会死，我也不会死，我死了我的儿子还是八路军！”他死了以后，他的老婆在坐月子，不久也气死了，只丢下一个六岁的孤儿，名叫小保。四月二十二日，伦掌联防干部及群众抬着棺材来刨死难者的尸体，首先刨出来的是姚立志亲弟兄两个，尸体已经成了半流动体，不能装殓。姚立志的眼睛鼻子和两只耳朵被割掉了，膀臂上割了一块肉，紧靠坑边有一棵树，树皮上沾染着紫色的血迹，姚立志就是在这个树上被绑着惨害的。正在刨尸与认尸的时候，李黑女（女）的母亲来找黑女，并拿着一条被子，众乐村魏清风的侄媳来找魏清风，西炉村崔全有的母亲也来找她的儿子。但都没有找着全尸。南崖村王黑成说：“我差一点没有被活埋了！伦掌谁不知道我黑成子住了一辈子长工，是个独门小户，去年十一月三十日，人家说咱斗争过杨树风，在保长局子里吊打我，死去活来，非活埋我不行，后来杨树学、杨树贵、杨来全等全家跪在保公所才算把我保下。我花了一石八斗四升米买了九亩二分地，这次都给人家啦，又把两石谷子也没收了，只留下几升谷子。”他现在见人就诉苦，并充满着复仇的愤怒，被活埋的，已经找到者卅余人，失踪者还有数十人。这次惨害的凶手是：伪伦掌乡正副乡长郭吉奎、姚德农，伪队长梁月兆及奸霸地主张月波、常树芝、杨南关等。这笔血债，伦掌群众正在清算，他们已喊出了“为死难弟兄复仇”的口号。
