【This newspaper's report from Ji-Lu-Yu on the 22nd】 The Nanwang County Party Committee summarized the achievements of the guerrilla war: (1) Insisting on the position, the democratic order was firmly established throughout the county. When Chiang's Fifth Army arrived in Nanwang, the county brigade always persisted in the struggle. The county's armed work team always carried out night activities in the gaps between the enemy's densely populated areas in Pobei, cutting telephone lines, disturbing the enemy, posting notices, distributing propaganda, and capturing enemy deserters and stragglers. It also eliminated more than 30 members of the stubborn Dongping Security Team and killed Peng Yuanyou, the leader of the stubborn enemy Zhang Security Team. In Pobei, the county brigade, in conjunction with the county and district armed work teams, launched a political offensive, destroying the bridges at Kaihe and Yuankou several times, hindering the enemy's transportation. The armed work teams of the sixth and seventh districts, in conjunction with the backbone brigade, killed Yu Ancai, the local tyrant, and eliminated the reactionary landlord of Caomiao Xue Magai. The armed work teams of the fifth district and the militia fought with a battalion of the puppet Wu Huawen for four hours. A group of seven people were able to fight calmly under the enemy's heavy machine gun fire, advancing and retreating freely. All districts in the county have universally carried out the struggle against aiding the enemy and against robbery, and have developed the political situation. (2) In the first and fourth districts, they have already achieved holding a gun in one hand and distributing land in the other, and guerrilla warfare is gradually becoming a mass guerrilla war. The experience gained in the guerrilla war is: (1) Armed forces and political power vigorously support the masses, resolutely suppress the bad landlords, strive for the wavering, and distribute land quickly, fighting and distributing quickly, distributing as the fight proceeds, and widening the scope of distribution. (2) In terms of leadership, the method of establishing merit through exemplary actions is used to commend good cadres who are brave, resolute, and obey orders, establish exemplary banners, and encourage all cadres to learn from the models, which has greatly promoted the work. (3) The distribution of land and food can be done by the soldiers themselves, which can strengthen the mass concept of the troops and make them more disciplined.

　　地方武装坚持活动成核心
    南旺游击战普遍开展
    【本报冀鲁豫二十二日电】南旺县委总结游击战争成绩：（一）坚持阵地，全县依然确立民主秩序。蒋五军到南旺时，县大队始终坚持斗争，县武工队始终在坡北敌人密集的空隙间夜间活动，割电线，扰乱敌人，张贴布告，散发宣传品，捕捉敌之逃兵散兵。并解决了顽东平保安队三十余人，打死了顽敌张保安队小队长彭远友。县大队在坡北结合县、区武工队开展政治攻势，几度破坏开河、袁口的桥梁，阻碍了敌人的交通。六、七区武工队结合基干大队，打死了土顽头子余安才，杀掉了草庙薛马垓的反动地主。五区武工队民兵连同伪吴化文一个营战斗四小时，一个小组七个人在敌重机枪火力下，仍能镇静作战，进退自如。全县各区都普遍开展了反资敌反抢劫的斗争，开展了政治形势。（二）在一、四区已做到一手拿枪，一手分田，游击战争逐步成为群众性的游击战。游击战争中所获得的经验是：（１）武装、政权大力给群众撑腰，对坏地主的坚决镇压，动摇的争取，分地要快斗快分，随斗随分，分的面要广。（２）领导上运用表模立功办法，对英勇坚决服从命令的好干部表扬，树立模范旗帜，鼓励所有干部向模范看齐，大大的推动了工作。（３）分地分粮可由战士亲自帮助去作，这样可以加强部队战士的群众观念，和更加遵守纪律。
