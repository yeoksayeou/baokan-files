　　Independence Movements Surge in French Colonies
    People of Madagascar Form Guerrilla Units, Repeatedly Defeating French Troops
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th] According to various reports: Independence movements in French colonies are flourishing. The people of French Madagascar (located in the Indian Ocean southeast of Africa, with an area of over 240,000 square miles and a population of approximately four million, the fourth largest island in the world) launched an uprising on March 29th to resist French colonial rule and demand independence. The uprising has spread throughout the island. The people of the island have formed guerrilla units armed with modern weapons. The central cities of the island, such as Tamatave and Antananarivo, have been attacked by people's guerrilla units. All local French garrison troops and constabulary have been mobilized to fight, but have been repeatedly defeated by the people's guerrilla units, and the French troops have suffered heavy losses. Although the French Ramadier government has dispatched a large number of troops and paratroopers to reinforce, it has been to no avail. To date, the people's guerrilla units in Madagascar still control vast areas and transportation routes, and are bravely fighting the French troops. According to French official sources, the independence movement in French colonies has spread to North Africa. The situation in French colonies in Oceania is also increasingly unstable, and the independence movement in the Marquesas Islands (located in the southeastern Pacific Ocean in Oceania) is brewing.

　　法国各殖民地独立运动勃起
    马达加斯加岛人民组游击队屡败法军
    【新华社陕北十一日电】据各方报导：法国各殖民地的独立运动方兴未艾。法属马达加斯加岛（位菲洲东南印度洋中，面积二十四万余方英里，人口约四百万，为世界第四大岛）人民于三月二十九日发动暴动，反抗法国殖民统治，要求独立，暴动遍及全岛。该岛人民已组成握有现代武器的游击队，该岛中心城市大马达维、安塔那那里瓦等地，均遭人民游击队攻击。当地法国驻军及宪兵队全部出动作战，历次被人民游击队击败，法军损失甚重。法国拉马第政府虽曾调大批军队及伞兵前往增援，但亦无济于事。迄今马达加斯加岛人民游击队仍控制广大地区及交通要道，正奋勇与法军作战中。另据法国官方消息，法属殖民地独立运动已扩及北菲。而大洋洲的法国殖民地情况亦日益不稳，大赫的岛（位大洋洲以东南太平洋中）独立运动正在酝酿中。
