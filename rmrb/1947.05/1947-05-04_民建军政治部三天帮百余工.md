　　People's Construction Army Political Department Helps Over a Hundred Workers in Three Days
    [Our Newspaper's News] The General Political Department of the Democratic Construction Army has enthusiastically launched a farming assistance campaign. In the three days of the 24th, 25th, and 26th of last month, they helped with a total of 134 work tasks, plowing 78.5 mu of corn stubble, plowing 24 mu of land, delivering 67 large carts of manure and 54 small carts, turning 224 carts of manure, as well as watering vegetables, digging land, filling pits... and other tasks. After the farming assistance, the spring plowing difficulties of the 13 military families in the garrison area have been largely resolved. The local masses were extremely moved. An old man named Guo Jin, who is 70 years old, said, "I have lived this long, and this is truly the first time I have seen the army hauling manure for the common people." The farming assistance work is still ongoing. (Xi Wen, Wen Qi)
    [Our Newspaper's Ji-Lu-Yu Dispatch, 2nd] The various sections of the Sixth Special Commissioner's Office and the Security Team of the Public Security Bureau have been formed into two large teams. During the afternoon break every day, they all go to help with spring plowing and adopt the method of short-term labor market. Each person brings farm tools to gather at Miaotai, where village cadres or landowners come to hire them (mainly to dig land for those who provided stretchers and the families of military workers and martyrs). They also propose competitions in their work, and in just three days, they have dug sixteen mu of land.

　　民建军政治部三天帮百余工
    【本报讯】民主建国军总政治部热烈展开助耕运动，在上月廿四、五、六三天内，共帮工一百三十四个，刨玉茭茬子七十八亩半，犁地二十四亩，送粪六十七大车，五十四小车，翻粪二百廿四车，及浇菜、挖地、填坑……等工作。经助耕之后，驻地十三家军属春耕困难已大部解决。驻地群众极为感动，年已七十岁的老汉国金的说：“我活了这大岁数，真是头一回看见军队给老百姓拉粪。”现助耕工作仍在继续进行中。（希文、文麒）
    【本报冀鲁豫二日电】六专署各科与公安局保卫队，已编成两个大队，在每天下午休息时间，都去帮助春耕，并采取短工上市的办法，各带农具在庙台集合，由村干或地户来领（主要是给出担架者与军工烈属掘地），并在工作中提出竞赛，仅三天即已挖地十六亩。
