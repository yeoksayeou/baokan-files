Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th. TASS published on the 8th the full record of Stalin's meeting with Stassen (a contender for the Republican Party's 1948 presidential nomination) at the Kremlin on the 9th of last month, and stated that the record had been approved by both parties. However, many intentional deletions and ambiguities appeared in the full text of the conversation published in the American press. The following are the key points of the full text of the conversation:

　　When discussing the issue of Soviet-American cooperation, Stalin said: People should distinguish between the possibility of cooperation and the desire for cooperation. There is often the possibility of cooperation, but there is not always the desire for cooperation. If one party refuses to cooperate, the result will be conflict and war. The Soviet Union, however, has a desire for cooperation. Although the United States and Germany, which launched the war, have different political systems, there is no difference in their economic systems. But cooperation does not require the same system. People should respect the system chosen and approved by the people. Whether the American system is good or not is a matter for the American people. Stalin said: When the people want to change the system, they will change it.

　　Regarding the Soviet Union's censorship system, Stalin said: It would be difficult for the Soviet Union without a censorship system. Every time the Soviet government abolished the censorship system, it led to some regrets. Stalin cited the fabricated reports by American journalists at the Tehran Conference and during his vacation in the autumn of 1945; and such incidents often occur. Stalin pointed out that the attitude of some American journalists towards the Soviet Union is bad, so the Soviet people are naturally angry and demand the restoration of the censorship system.

　　Stassen asked: Regarding the control and regulation of atomic energy production and its peaceful use, does Your Excellency think there is any hope of reaching an agreement in the future? Stalin replied: He hoped so. He believes that the use of atomic energy for military purposes should be prohibited as much as possible. This is the desire and moral requirement of many countries, and it is possible to stipulate international supervision and control, and this is now proceeding in this direction. He believes that the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes will bring about a major revolution in industry.

　　Regarding Europe, Stalin believes that the current situation in Europe is very bad. Europe has a large number of factories and manufacturing plants, but they are in a tragic situation due to lack of raw materials and food. Stalin explained that the geographical environment and national history of the United States are conducive to the great development of the United States.

　　Stassen said: The main task of the United States now is to avoid depression and economic crisis, and the main task is to avoid the crisis of the American economic system. But if the government can adopt smart policies and recognize the lessons of 1929 and 1930, controlled capitalism rather than monopoly capitalism will dominate in the United States, which can avoid crises.

　　Stalin said: To achieve this goal, a very strong government is needed, with great determination. Stalin said: Before the war, about 10 percent of American products were sold to other countries, and now it may increase to 20 percent. But Stassen affirmatively replied: He estimated that it would not exceed 15 percent, and he believed that if it could increase to 15 percent, the United States would be lucky. Stassen said: All factories in the United States are responsible for carrying out 100 percent of the work, but they are able to supply the demand for food, women's clothing, shoes and socks, while the production of machines, automobiles and locomotives is lagging behind.

　　Stassen said: Industrialists are often against control. But he said: This is necessary under any political system and regime, and making mistakes is not good for the people, as Japan and Germany have proven. Stalin said: The economies of these countries are manipulated by the military, who are ignorant of economics. Therefore, Japan's economy was dominated by Tojo, who only knew how to fight.

　　塔斯社公布
    斯大林与史塔生谈话纪录
    【新华社陕北十二日电】塔斯社于八日公布上月九日斯大林在克里姆林宫接见史塔生（美共和党一九四八年总统候选人之竞选者）时之谈话纪录全文，并声明该项纪录系经二氏各自认可的。然而，在美国报界所发表的谈话全文中则有许多有意删改与不明确之论点出现。以下为该项谈话纪录全文之要点：在谈及苏美合作问题时，斯大林说：人们应当把合作的可能与合作的愿望分清，常常有合作的可能性，但却并不是常常有合作的愿望。假如一方拒绝合作，其结果将是冲突战争。而苏联则是有合作之愿望的。美国与发动战争的德国在政体上虽有不同，在经济制度上却无区别。但合作并不要求彼此有同一制度，人们应尊重为人民所选择和允准的制度。美国的制度好不好，这是美国人民的事情。斯氏谓：当人民愿望改变制度的时候，他们就会改变它。谈到苏联的新闻检查制度时，斯大林说：对苏联说，没有检查制度会是困难的。苏联政府每次取消检查制度，每次都引致一些遗憾。斯氏并例举美国记者在德黑兰会议时及一九四五年秋季渠度假期美国记者所捏造的报导；而此种事件常常发生。斯氏指出，一部分美国记者对苏联的态度是恶劣的，自然苏联人民是愤怒，并且要求恢复检查制度。史塔生问：关于原子能生产之管制与规章及其和平的使用问题。阁下认为在将来是否有获致协议之任何希望？斯氏答称：彼希望如此。彼认为应尽可能的禁止利用原子能于军事方面，这是许多国家的愿望和道义上的要求，而规定由国际监督和控制是可能的，现在已是正向这个方向进行。他认为原子能用于和平方面，将使工业发生一个大的革命。谈到欧洲，斯氏认为目前欧洲的情况是很坏的。欧洲有极多的工厂和制造厂，但是却因缺乏原料和粮食而陷于悲惨境地。斯大林说明美国地理环境与民族历史都便于美国的极大发展。史塔生说：美国现在的工作避免不景气和经济危机，其主要的工作是避免美国经济制度的危机。但是如果政府能采用聪明的政策和认清一九二九年一九三○年的教训，不是垄断的而是受控制的资本主义将在美国占统治地位，这将可以避免危机。斯大林说：要达成这个目的，需要非常强有力的政府，并且有极大的决心。斯大林说：战前美国生产品约有百分之十运销他国，现在或将增加到百分之二十。但史塔生肯定的回答说：他估计不能超过百分之十五，他并认为如能增加到百分十五，美国就是幸运的了。史氏说：美国所有的工厂都责成进行百分之百的工作，但是它们向能供应食品和妇女服装鞋袜之要求，而机器汽车和火车头的生产则是落后的。史塔生说：实业家经常是反对控制的。但他说：在任何政制及政体之下来说，这是必需的，而造成错误对于人民是不好的，日本与德国已证明如此。斯大林说：这些国家之经济为军人所操纵，而他们对于经济是无知的。因此，日本之经济便被只会如何打仗的东条支配了。
