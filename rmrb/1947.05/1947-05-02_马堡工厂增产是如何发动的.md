　　How the Mabu Factory Launched Increased Production
　　Gao Wenlin

　　I. A Brief History of Taiwu Factory

　　The Mabu Factory was formed after the surrender of the Japanese invaders in 1945, through the merger of various district repair shops, becoming a cooperative operation. At that time, the leadership's style was undemocratic, cadres were not united, and no ideological mobilization was carried out among the workers during the merger. The workers did not believe in cooperative operation. In addition, the factory was not profitable, the profit-sharing methods were inadequate, the workers' lives were not guaranteed, and there were internal factional disputes among the workers, which lowered the workers' morale and led them to request leave to return home. At its worst, the number of workers decreased from one hundred and eighty to ninety-one. This situation almost led to the collapse of the factory. Around July of last year, the leadership discovered the above problems and subsequently launched a mass-based comprehensive work review and inspection from July 1st to July 7th, which solved some problems. The leadership, adhering to the principle of "everyone handles their own affairs," established a factory management committee and also established various systems, such as adjusting gun prices based on fluctuations in the prices of various goods. To ensure that workers could work with peace of mind, a fixed salary was stipulated, in addition to a three-seven surplus profit sharing (workers get three, the public gets seven), settled every two months. As a result of solving these problems, the morale of all the staff and workers in the factory was stronger than in the past. On this basis, a short-term seventy-day production competition was launched, which also achieved some results.

　　II. How the Movement Was Launched

　　In early March, the Mabu Factory received the Taihang General Trade Union's call and instructions to the entire district to engage in large-scale production. Combining this with the factory's own situation, all the staff and cadres of the factory discovered the following problems: (1) Wage issues. The workers all said: "Whether we produce or not, prices keep rising. I don't know how our wages are calculated!" Most workers had the idea that "I don't care if the factory is good or bad, I'll just work if I get paid." (2) There were many apprentices and few skilled workers. Due to the change in work, each department was not yet proficient in their work, and labor allocation was not precise enough. There were often conflicts in work, such as the breechblock department being able to produce 180 per month, while the magazine department could only produce 90. (3) The previous movement last year also achieved some results, but the cadres did not participate, there was no plan, and it was simply a quantity competition. To enable the masses to consciously participate in the production and meritorious service movement, the leadership conducted a short-term mass ideological mobilization. Cadres went deep into the worker masses to conduct brainstorming and solicit individual opinions, discovering that in addition to purely economic demands, the workers also said: "The peasants have obtained land and turned over, what about us? We are still holding onto the small wolf's head." Some also said they hadn't turned over. My father worked for others his whole life, and I have worked for others my whole life. I think my grandson will still be working for others his whole life. The main thing is that the workers haven't turned over. From this, a mass discussion was launched, comparing their own history and current life, and social status. After several days of discussion, someone said: "In the past, in capitalist factories, we ate their food and worked for them. People called us spinning tops, afraid to fall off." Now, we are "eating our own food and working for ourselves, jointly formulating plans, and jointly producing. The factory director is also a worker, and the workers have also become masters." Subsequently, everyone proposed "protecting the Big Canal" (meaning cherishing the revolutionary factory). The slogan was "If the Big Canal is not full, the small canal will not flow. If the Big Canal is always full, the small canal will always flow." Because of the above problems, the workers were given some ideological enlightenment. Finally, combined with current affairs education, real wages were increased by 25% as prices rose. The factory director called on everyone to participate in the Great Turn-Over Movement, overthrow the four major families, and launch a production movement to perform meritorious service for the people. Thus, the production movement was brewing among the masses, and meetings were held to discuss and formulate production plans. First, cadres and activists formulated plans to promote the masses. The plans were based on their own work and the shortcomings in their work. After formulation, they were reviewed and approved by the masses. If there were any shortcomings, they were revised. For example, the workers’ foreman, Chen Shangzhi's plan, was given opinions by the masses and revised three times. This way of formulating plans made the workers feel very satisfied. It was also stipulated that the plans would be continuously revised as the movement developed and needed. After individuals and departments formulated plans, the Gauge Department first issued a challenge to the entire factory. As a result, within five days, all the staff and workers participated in the movement. As the movement developed, the requirements for quantity and quality increased. Therefore, mutual assistance among workers in the movement became essential. In organizing mutual aid groups, the first step was to overcome the fear of loss and the fear of being unfree among technically skilled workers. The second was to ensure that the profit-sharing methods were reasonable. For example, the Gauge Department implemented piece-rate wages and graded profit-sharing, with more work leading to more profit sharing. Their approach was to divide the entire gauge into parts, with each person taking a share of the work. Five gauge covers are counted as one complete gauge. Five bolt carriers are counted as one complete gauge. Three and a half gauge bases are counted as one complete gauge. This can solve the problem of differences in speed and skill. The profit-sharing method was based on the amount of work done and the level of skill, as assessed by the masses. Solving the above problems, the Gauge Department improved both the quantity and quality of production. In the past, each person made three gauges in four days. Now, they make more than one gauge per day and they are more standardized. The relationship between masters and apprentices was also strengthened. For example, the skilled worker Gui Xiufeng patiently helped his apprentice, and the apprentice also helped him with odd jobs. They also promoted mutual research and improved technical requirements, which also played a role in mutual supervision.

　　III. Achievements of One Month of Movement

　　At the beginning of the movement, all staff and workers participated. Cadres carried water to help the cooks, reducing their fatigue. Union Chairman Xu Jiacun went to work despite being ill. Workers’ foreman Chen Shangzhi participated in the repair department's work in his spare time. Chang Keming conveyed news from the newspapers to the workers during meal times. The cooks brought water to the workers in the workshops. Production results have significantly improved. The monthly output of rifles exceeded the original plan by 27%. In terms of quality, Guo Yousan and Qu Yuzhen researched day and night, and now they have the title of "Type 38". The power has also increased, and it can penetrate three and a half points of thick steel plate at a distance of sixty meters. In terms of tools, one engine lathe and one drilling machine were completed. After completing their tasks, Hao Shenggui and others also made four sets of clamping plates, four adjustable wrenches, one set of typeheads, one caliper, and three sets of thread dies. They repaired eight rifles for the militia and completed the worm gear for the homemade engine lathe at the end of the month. Furthermore, in order to improve the quality, comrades in various departments also modified some of their daily-use small tools. For example, labor hero Gui Xiufeng, together with parts department mutual aid group leaders Li Suixing, Zhang Shuangcun, and Chang Shuijin, used Sundays to transform the grinding wheel shield mold and the gauge mold. After the self-modification, the finished products were both more standardized and reduced the scrap rate of apprentices.

　　马堡工厂增产是如何发动的
    高文林
    一、太武工厂的简历
    马堡工厂是在一九四五年日寇投降后，由各分区修械所合并起来，改为合作经营。当时领导上作风不民主，干部之间不团结，在合并时又没在工人中进行思想动员，工人对合作经营不相信，加之工厂不赚钱，分红办法欠妥，工人生活没保障，工人内部又闹宗派，使工人情绪不高，要求请假回家。最严重时，由一百八十个工人，减少到九十一个工人。这种情况，使工厂几乎走向垮台。去年七月间，领导上发现以上问题，随提出七一、至七七，展开群众性的全面工作回顾与检查，当时也解决了些问题。领导上本着“大家事大家办”，成立了工厂管理委员会，也确定了各种制度，如枪价以各种货物涨落而增减，为使工人安心工作，规定固定工资外，实行三七剩余分红（工三、公七），每两月结算一次。由此问题的解决，全厂的职工人员在情绪上是比过去强了，就在这个基础上，发动了一个短时期的七十天生产竞赛，也收到了一些成绩。
    二、运动是怎样搞起来的
    三月初，马堡工厂接到太行总工会向全区发出大生产号召和指示。全厂的职工干部，结合本厂情况，发现以下几个问题：（一）工资问题，工人都说：“生产不生产吧，物价一直上涨，不知咱的工资是怎样算哩？”大部分工人存在着“工厂好坏不管，给钱就干”的思想。（二）学徒多，工匠少，由于改活，各部门做活还不够熟练，劳力配备不够精细，常在工作上发生顶手，如拴管部每月可做一百八，子匣部又能做九十个。（三）去年的一次运动，也收到了一些成绩，但干部没有参加，也没有计划，又是单纯的数量竞赛。为使群众自觉的参加生产立功运动，领导上进行了一次短时期的群众思想发动。干部深入职工群众里，进行酝酿，和个别征求意见，发现工人内心思想，除单纯经济思想要求外，还有的说：“农民得到了土地，翻身了，咱们呢？还是拿着小狼头。”也有人说没翻身，我父亲给人家做了一辈子工，我又给人家做了一辈子，我看我的孙子也还是给人家做一辈子工。主要的是工人没有翻身。由此展开群众讨论，结合自己历史和现在生活、社会地位对比。经几天大家讨论，有人说：“过去在资本家工厂里是吃了人家饭，当事给人家干，人叫扑拉球，不敢落人家旦。”现在是“吃着自己饭，干事给自己干，共同订计划，共同来生产。厂长也是工人，工人也变成主人。”随着大家提出“保护大渠”（爱护革命工厂的意思），口号是“大渠不满，小渠不流，大渠常满，小渠常流。”由于以上的问题，在思想上给了工人一些启发，最后结合时事教育，在工资问题上，随着物价上涨，实物工资提增百分之二十五。厂长号召大家参加大翻身运动，打垮四大家族，展开生产运动，来为民立功。由此生产运动在群众中酝酿，并开会讨论着订生产计划。首先由干部积极分子订出计划，来推动群众，计划一是按自己应作的工作，及自己工作中所存在的缺点，订出后经过群众审查批准，如有不够的地方，再修正。如工务长陈尚智的计划，由群众给提出意见，经过三次修改，这样订计划，使工人觉得非常满意，并规定随着运动的发展和需要，不断的修改，经过个人，各部订计划后，首先由标尺部向全厂发出挑战，结果在五天内，全体职工都参加了运动。随着运动的发展，在数量质量上要求提高，因此运动中的职工互助，成为必须的东西。组织互助组，首先是给技术好的工人打通怕吃亏，怕参加了互助组不自由的思想，其次是分红办法要合理。如标尺部，实行按件计工，按等分红，多做活多分红，他们的做法是：把整个标尺分成零件，分工合作，标尺盖五个顶一个全标尺。走码五个顶一个全标尺，标尺座，三个半顶一个全标尺。这可以解决手快慢，做活好坏的问题。分红办法，是群众自己依做活多少技术好坏评级分红。把以上问题解决标尺部提高了数质量，过去每人四天做三个，现在是一天做一个多还规矩。师徒之间也团结了，如工匠桂秀峰耐心帮助徒弟，徒弟也帮助他做零活，并促进大家互相研究，提高技术的要求，也起了互相督促作用。
    三、一个月运动的成绩
    运动一开始全体职工参加，干部们担水帮助火夫，减少他们疲劳。工会主任徐家存带病上工，工务长陈尚智抽时参加修理部工作，常克明抽吃饭时间，给工人传达报纸上的消息，火夫往工房给工人送水，生产成绩有显著提高。全月出步枪超过原计划百分之廿七。在质量上经郭有三、曲玉珍白黑夜的研究，现有“三八式”的称号，在威力上也大了，六十米远能打透三分半厚的钢板。在工具方面，完成元车钻车各一部。郝生贵等九人，任务完成后，还做了夹板四付，活搬手四个，字头一付，卡钳一个、板牙三付，给民兵修理步枪八支，并将土元车挂牙轮，在月底完成。而各部门的同志，为着质量提高，个人日常用的小工具，也改了一些，如劳动英雄桂秀峰与零件部互助组长李随兴、张双存、常水金，抽礼拜日改造口弹上竖磨磨子挡机模子与标尺模子，自改出后，成品又规矩，也减少了学徒的报废。
