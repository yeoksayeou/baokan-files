　　Evidence and Witnesses Abound, No Denying It!
    Chiang Kai-shek Was a Longtime Traitor
    Sun Dianying Confesses Jiang's Instructions to Surrender to the Japanese.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Henan Front, 10th] Our reporter Li Pu reports: The fact that the traitor Sun Dianying surrendered to the Japanese invaders was due to Chiang Kai-shek's secret orders. General Liu Bocheng revealed this secret when he summoned Sun Dianying and others a few days ago. When General Liu said to Sun and his senior subordinates, "In the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, we cannot say that you made no contributions, but what you did later was really too bad," before Sun's subordinates could answer, Sun Dianying himself suddenly hysterically shouted, "Chiang Kai-shek ordered me to be a traitor, and afterwards secretly sent people to try to get that order back, but that was impossible!" According to his subordinates, this order has been made into a photograph and carefully stored. Li Minbin, Sun Dianying's major general director of the political department (now changed to major general director of the press office), was sent by Hu Zongnan of the First War Area, arriving for duty last October. After arriving, he wrote a "Past and Present of the Provisional 3rd Column" report, including: A. The first paragraph on the Taihang Incident and the current suppression of bandits says: "1. After the full-scale War of Resistance Against Japan, the Sun unit was incorporated into the New Fifth Army as a guerrilla force in Hebei and Chahar provinces due to its war merits. In April 1942, after the Taihang Incident, Chiang, the former commander of this war zone, successively dispatched political department secretary Liu Yuankun and party and government general captain Jing Xiansheng to secretly convey the leader's loving care and give guidance, encouraging righteousness... All of this can be verified." The so-called guidance was to surrender to the enemy and oppose the Communists; the so-called righteousness was "saving the country by a roundabout route." Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial betrayal of the country is already well known. The so-called Taihang Incident refers to Sun Dianying being captured by the Japanese. After Sun was captured, Chiang Kai-shek was still able to send high-ranking officials twice to convey orders, showing the close relationship between Chiang Kai-shek and the Japanese imperialists in secretly colluding with each other. There is also a letter from Pang Bingxun to Sun Dianying that can also serve as evidence. This is the original letter in which Pang Bingxun asked him to help him surrender to the enemy after Sun Dianying openly surrendered to the enemy. It was photographed in a six-inch photo, and the content is as follows: "My dear brother Dianying: We have suffered together for decades, sharing life and death. This time, my brother was forced by circumstances to do this. It can be said that he has a clear conscience and does not fail the people, so as to avoid the defeat of officers and soldiers and joining the treacherous bandits, harming the country and the people. Regardless of whether the people of the country understand or not, he only seeks peace of mind. But the New Fifth Army already has a solution. I hope my brother can quickly find a proper solution for the 40th Army. The relationship between my brothers must not be polite. I think my brother must treat the 40th Army the same as the New Fifth Army in this difficult situation. My brother has no prejudice and agrees with my brother's opinion. Please send a reliable person to meet with the Japanese army overnight to explain the pros and cons. If they continue to oppress us, they will inevitably cause the scattered officers and soldiers to join the traitors, which is not in their interest either. Your brother Xun, May 4th." The original letter was written in pen and is Pang Bingxun's handwriting. People like Pang Bingxun, a member of the Kuomintang Central Committee, used the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army as political capital to sell their souls and curry favor with the Japanese imperialists. They said to Neiji Okamura: "If you force me again, I will cooperate with the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army." This is such a nauseating prostitute's tone. This is also the reason why Chiang Kai-shek was able to put on a show of resisting Japan during the War of Resistance Against Japan, while actually sending his subordinates to surrender to the enemy and oppose the Communists. It is also the reason why the Japanese imperialists flirted with Chiang Kai-shek while allowing Chiang Kai-shek to collude with open traitors and puppet troops. After Sun and Pang openly surrendered to the enemy, He Yingqin repeatedly issued statements to defend them, saying that Pang and Sun were firm and unyielding and had not surrendered to the enemy, and that Pang and Sun were forced to surrender by the CCP and failed, which is extremely shameless. Now that there is evidence and witnesses, the truth is revealed to the world, and it turns out that all of this was a conspiracy by the great traitor Chiang Kai-shek.

　　人证物证俱在狡辩不得！
    蒋介石早是大汉奸
    孙逆殿英供认降日系蒋指示
    【新华社豫北前线十日电】本社记者李普报导：汉奸头子孙殿英之投降日寇，系由于蒋介石的秘密命令。刘伯承将军日前召见孙殿英等时，孙等公开暴露了这个秘密。当刘将军对孙及其高级僚属说：抗战初期，不能说你们没有贡献，但是以后的一段，确实做得太不好了。”孙的僚属们还没有来得及答话，孙殿英自己突然歇斯底里地叫道：“蒋介石下命令叫我当汉奸，事后又秘密派人来想把那个命令要回去，那还能行啊！”据他的部下说，这个命令已制成照片，妥慎收藏。孙殿英的少将政治部主任李民彬（现改为少将新闻处长），由第一战区胡宗南派来，于去年十月到差，到差后，来了一篇“暂编第三纵队过去及现在”的报告意见书，其中：甲、太行事变后与现在剿匪的第一段说：“一、查孙部于全面抗战后，冀察游击队以战功被编为新五军，四二年四月太行事变，经本战区前长官蒋先后派遣政治部秘书刘元坤，党政总队长荆宪生秘密转示领袖曲予爱护之意，授以方略，勖以大义，…………均有事实可查。”接所谓方略，就是投敌反共；所谓大义，就是“曲线救国”，是蒋介石的独裁卖国，这已是人所共知的了。所谓太行事变，是指孙殿英的被日本俘掳。当孙被俘之后，蒋介石仍能两次派遣大员传达命令，可见蒋介石和日本帝国主义者暗渡陈仓，勾勾搭搭的亲密关系。另外还有一封庞炳勋给孙殿英的信，也可以做证，这是在孙殿英公开投敌以后，庞炳勋请他牵线投敌的原信，摄成六英寸的照片，内容是这样：“殿英我弟：我辈患难数十年，生死与共，此次弟为环境所迫，如此作法，可谓仰不愧天，俯不作人，以免官兵失败，投入奸匪，祸国害民，无论国人谅解与否，只求良心所安。但新五军已有办法，望弟对四十军速想一妥善办法，我弟兄之关系，万勿客气。想弟在此恶劣情况中，必视四十军与新五军一样，兄决无成见，以弟主张为是，请星夜派一妥人来与日军面陈利害，如再压迫，必使流散官兵投奸伪，亦非其利。兄勋手，五月四日”。原信是用钢笔写的，是庞炳勋的亲笔。国民党中委庞炳勋之流，就把共产党、八路军作为向日本帝国主义者出卖灵魂和撒娇讨好的政治资本。他们向冈村宁次说：“你再逼我，我就要和共产党、八路军合作了。”这是多么肉麻的娼妓口吻，这也就是蒋介石在抗战时期之所以能够一面做出抗战的样子，一面实际上派遣部下投敌反共的原因；也是日本帝国主义者一面和蒋介石眉来眼去，一面又允许蒋介石和公开的汉奸伪军勾勾搭搭的原因。孙、庞公开投敌以后，何应钦一直发表声明为他们辩解；一则说庞、孙坚贞不屈，并未投敌；再则说庞、孙是中共逼迫而失败的，真可谓无耻已极。现在人证物证俱在，真象大白于天下，原来这一切都是大汉奸蒋介石耍的阴谋诡计。
