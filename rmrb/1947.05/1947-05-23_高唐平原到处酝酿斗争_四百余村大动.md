(Our newspaper, Jinan, 21st dispatch) The land reform movement in the new Gaotang and Pingyuan districts has entered a high tide, with over 400 villages igniting the flames of anti-traitor liquidation. Since 6,248 farmers from 124 villages in Gaotang returned after training, 205 villages have immediately entered into great upheaval, while other villages are brewing struggles. In the farmer training classes of each district, after venting grievances, class education, and mutual enlightenment, everyone had long made up their minds to settle accounts with the landlords. In Sun Jiaen's village in the Third District, the masses went back in the middle of the night to arrest the households to be struggled against. When the masses in Yang Zhuang in the Eighth District struggled against the landlords, they all carried hoes and red-tasseled spears, greatly demonstrating the great power of the peasants after they rose up. Many landlords in the villages sent pork and steamed buns to curry favor during the farmers' training, but they were seen through by the farmers, who firmly refused to accept them. The movement is now developing universally and vigorously. After large-scale turn-over meetings and farmer training in the new Pingyuan district, over 200 villages have formed a situation of great upheaval; the 36 villages in the eastern part of the Fourth District are distributing land. In the First District, two-thirds of the 108 villages outside the city have moved. During the training, seven villages, including Luan Zhuang and Chou Zhuang, arrested objects of struggle. After the Third District held a turn-over meeting of more than 2,000 people, most of the villages arrested objects of struggle; when the masses in Guan Zhuang returned to the village, the feudal landlords set up cases to welcome them, but the farmers kicked them over and tied up the landlords. The entire district is under unified martial law, and no one can pass without a pass from the village turn-over committee. In the eastern part of the Fifth District, 22 of the 29 villages have taken action. In order to combine the spring plowing and sowing, the County Committee specifically put forward the slogan of fighting on one hand and planting on the other, fighting, distributing, and planting at the same time.

　　高唐平原到处酝酿斗争
    四百余村大动
    【本报冀南二十一日电】高唐、平原新区土地改革运动进入高潮，四百余村燃起反奸清算烈火。高唐自一百二十四个村的六千二百四十八名农民受训回村后，立即有二百零五个村进入大动，其他村正在酝酿斗争。各区农民训练班中，经诉苦和阶级教育及互相启发，大家都早有了与地主算账决心。三区孙家恩群众半夜回去扣起被斗户，八区杨庄群众当斗争地主时，都拿着镢头、红缨枪等，大大显示出农民起来后的伟大力量，不少村地主于农民集训时送猪肉、馒头买好，但都被农民识破，坚拒不收，现运动正在普遍猛烈开展中。平原新区经大规模召开翻身大会，农民集训后有二百多村形成大动局面；四区东部三十六个村正在分地。一区城外一百零八个村已有三分之二的村动起来。在集训中即有栾庄、仇庄等七个村扣起了斗争对象。三区召开了两千多人的翻身大会后，大部村庄扣起了斗争对象；管庄群众回村，封建地主摆了案子迎接，农民一脚踢翻，并把地主捆了起来。全区并统一戒严，没村翻身委员会的条子即不能通行。五区东部二十九个村，已有二十二个村行动起来。为了结合春耕播种，县委会特提出一面斗争，一面种地，随斗、随分、随种的口号。
