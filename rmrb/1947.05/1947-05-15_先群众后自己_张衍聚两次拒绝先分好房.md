　　Put the Masses First, Not Yourself
    Zhang Yanju Twice Refuses to Be Allotted a Good House First
    [This newspaper, Jinan, 13th dispatch] Zhang Yanju, a representative of the emancipated peasants in Liukou Village, Pingxiang First District, always considers the masses first and handles problems fairly and justly. When dividing houses, someone suggested, "Our director has worked hard for our emancipation from beginning to end. His family is very poor, and his house is so dilapidated that it is almost uninhabitable. Let's give Director Zhang Guangjin's courtyard to the director." All the masses agreed, but Zhang Yanju refused, saying, "I shouldn't be allotted that. It's true my house is dilapidated, but my courtyard is not small and can accommodate a three-section house. Now that everyone has elected me as a representative of the emancipated peasants, I should serve everyone. There are others who are worse off than me, so give it to them!" Later, in the house allocation committee, the masses again proposed, "We said we would give the director that courtyard, but he doesn't want it. This time, let's give him Zhang Xingan's three-room brick house facing north!" Zhang Yanju immediately and resolutely refused, saying, "This matter should be specifically discussed by the house allocation committee and the masses, and based on the spirit of filling gaps, I should be allotted as much as I am entitled to. As a representative, I shouldn't be allotted more." As a result, he didn't take it. Seeing that he was so sincerely thinking of everyone, the masses supported and loved him even more.

　　先群众后自己
    张衍聚两次拒绝先分好房
    【本报冀南十三日电】平乡一区柳口村翻身代表张衍聚，处处为群众打算，处理问题公平正直。分宅子时，有人提议：“咱主任为咱翻身，从头到尾都很卖力气，他家很穷，房子破的快不能住了，咱把斗争张光金的那处院给了主任吧。”全体群众都很同意，但张衍聚却拒绝了，他说：“我不该分那些，我的房破是真，我的院并不小，能盖三合房，大家现选我当翻身代表，就应为大家服务，还有不如我的哩，就分给他们吧！”后来在分房委员会上，群众又提议：“咱说给主任那个院他不要，这次咱把张心干的三间砖北房给了他吧！”张衍聚又马上坚决拒绝说：“这事应由分房委员会及群众具体讨论，根据填补精神，该分给我多少即分多少，我当代表不该多分东西。”结果也没要，群众见他这样真心为大家着想，更加对他拥护与爱戴。
