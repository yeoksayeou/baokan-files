　　The wheat is ripe, not a single grain can be taken by the enemy!
  　Northern Henan launches a wheat protection struggle.
  　Du Balian implements labor-military combination and mutual aid to harvest wheat
    [Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] Comprehensive Report: In various parts of northern Henan, the wheat is approaching harvest time. Chiang’s puppets are restless, desperately trying to plunder the wheat harvest. The masses in our border areas have been urgently mobilized to wage a fierce struggle against Chiang’s puppets to defend their lifeline, and to strike at the enemy's conspiracy to seize wheat. In the border areas of Ji and Qi counties, Chiang's puppets have already cut the green wheat that has not yet ripened to disrupt and sabotage our masses' wheat harvest. The masses in the Second District have organized wheat harvesting shock brigades, with men, women, old, and young participating. Young and middle-aged men and women are in charge of cutting and carrying, while children and the elderly are in charge of threshing, ensuring quick harvesting, quick threshing, quick drying, and quick storage. No matter whose land it is, harvest whatever is ripe, cut and thresh each piece as it's cut, with mutual assistance and mutual labor exchange. If the enemy harasses during the day, harvest at night as well. The use of livestock and threshing grounds is specifically organized, with June 1st to 7th designated as a shock week. To ensure the masses can harvest with peace of mind, the armed work teams and district cadre teams are actively operating in the border areas in two groups to strike at the enemy's plundering conspiracy. The Fifth District of Qi County began harvesting barley on the 19th of this month. The enemy launched attacks and disturbances in the area twenty li east and west of the railway. The local mass armed forces have launched a wheat protection guerrilla war. Luoquanming in Jiaozuo convened a meeting of village cadres, militia, and self-defense forces on May 5th, officially forming a guerrilla force to armedly protect the wheat harvest. They have also established joint defense with Dongzhangzhuang, Xuhe, and nearby villages to jointly protect the wheat harvest and prevent the enemy from taking a single grain. (Jiu Ru, Guo Cheng, Hong Fu)
    [Dispatch from this Newspaper, Taihang, 26th] In order to launch the movement to protect fields and wheat, the Fourth and Fifth Sub-districts of Taihang, in addition to organizing armed turn-over teams to penetrate into the enemy-adjacent areas and guerrilla areas, have issued work instructions on armed defense of the wheat harvest, emphasizing: 1. Arm the turned-over masses to rise up and protect fields and wheat. 2. Labor-military exchange of labor: the village should be responsible for helping harvest and cultivate on behalf of the militia supporting the front lines; the militia active on the front lines should do their best to help the masses rush the harvest. 3. Continue to carry out guerrilla warfare in border areas and newly recovered areas. 4. Pay attention to appropriate adjustment of the use of labor in the front and rear. Women, children, and semi-labor force in the rear should organize large-scale mutual aid to storm the wheat harvest. (Sifen Wu, Jiang Qing)
    [Dispatch from this Newspaper, Taiyue, 26th] The Ji Yuan Du Balian militia recently held a review meeting to carry out combat mobilization to prepare for the upcoming wheat harvest struggle. The meeting put forward slogans such as "One hand holding a gun, one hand holding a shovel" and "Harvesting, fighting, and storing simultaneously," and decided to organize a labor force and a labor-military combination labor exchange method. In organizing the labor force, all men, women, full and semi-labor forces were organized to ensure that no one was idle and no sickle rested. The division of labor was clear: full male laborers bound and carried wheat, semi-laborers threshed and cut wheat. Women and children participated in cutting wheat, picking up wheat, and loading wheat, and old women cooked at home and led the children. In terms of labor-military combination, stone mines were used to block the border areas. The militia also prepared sickles; they fought when the enemy came and cut wheat when the enemy left. A large-scale labor-military exchange of labor was implemented between the front and rear. The Liewei base village in the rear first organized fifty people to go to the front to rush the harvest, and in the next round, the Du Balian militia replaced them in the rotation. In the enemy-adjacent area, a night rush harvest was organized. In terms of time, it was required to achieve "three completions in ten days," that is, three days to complete the cutting, five days to complete the threshing, and two days to complete the storage. Currently, the militia and the masses are preparing sickles while rushing to build stone mines. The prelude to the wheat harvest struggle has already begun, and the Daqiao outside the Potou stronghold has been completely destroyed by the militia.

　　麦子黄了，不能让敌人抢走一粒！
  　豫北展开护麦斗争
  　杜八联实行劳武结合变工收麦
    【本报特讯】综合报导：豫北各地麦子已届收割时期，蒋伪蠢蠢思动，亟图抢掠麦收；我边缘区群众已紧急动员起来，为保卫命根子而与蒋伪展开激烈斗争，打击敌人抢麦阴谋。汲、淇边缘地区，蒋伪为扰乱破坏我群众麦收，已将没有成熟的青麦割掉。二区群众已组织起麦收突击队，男女老少齐参加。男女青壮年管割管担，儿童老年管打场，保证做到快收、快打、快晒，快藏。不论谁家的地，熟一块割一块，割一块打一块，互助变工。如白天敌人扰乱，夜间也要收割。牲口和打麦场的使用，都有具体组织，预定六月一日至七日为突击周。为了保证群众安心收割，武工队和区干队分两路在边沿地带积极活动，打击敌人抢掠阴谋。淇县五区本月十九号已经开始收割大麦，敌人在铁路东西二十来里的地区进攻扰乱，当地群众武装已展开保麦游击战争。焦作罗圈明曾于五月五日召开全村干部、民兵、自卫队会议，正式成立游击队，武装保卫麦收。并与东张庄、许河附近村庄建立联防，共同保卫麦收，不让敌人抢走一颗麦。　　　        （九如、国成、洪福）
    【本报太行二十六日电】太行四五分区为开展保田、保麦运动，除已组织武装翻身队深入接敌区、游击区活动外，均已发出武装保卫麦收的工作指示，强调提出：一、武装翻身群众，起来保田保麦。二、劳武变工：支援前线的民兵，村上要负责代收、代耕；在前线活动的民兵，应尽力帮助群众抢收。三、边沿区和新收复区，继续开展游击战争。四、前后方劳力使用，应注意适当调剂。后方妇女儿童半劳力，组织大互助，突击麦收。      （四分武、江清）
    【本报太岳二十六日电】济源杜八联民兵于日前举行检阅大会，进行战斗动员，准备迎接即将到来的麦收斗争。会上提出“一手拿枪、一手拿铲”，“边收、边打、边藏”等口号，并决定组织劳力与劳武结合变工办法。在组织劳力上，把所有男女全半劳力组织起来，作到不闲一个人，不歇一张镰，分工明确，男全劳力捆麦担麦，半劳力打场、割麦。妇女儿童参加割麦、拾麦、装麦，老太婆在家做饭引孩子。在劳武结合上，边沿区用石雷封锁。民兵亦准备镰刀，敌来进行战斗，敌走进行割麦。前后方实行劳武大变工。后边的栗围基点村先组织五十个人到前边突击抢收，下期轮战时，杜八联民兵替他们轮战。接敌区，组织黑夜抢收。在时间上，要求做到“十天三完”，即三天割完，五天打完，两天藏完。现民兵群众正一面准备镰刀，一面赶造石雷。麦收斗争序幕刻已展开，坡头据点外围大桥，已被民兵彻底破坏。
