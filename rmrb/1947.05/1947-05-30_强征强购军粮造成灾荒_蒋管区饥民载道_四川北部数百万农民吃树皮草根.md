Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, May 28th. A compilation of Shanghai newspaper reports: Chiang Kai-shek's forced grain requisitioning and purchasing in various regions has caused severe famine in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas. In Sichuan, known as the "Land of Abundance," the Chiang-controlled Ministry of Food sent supervisory teams to various counties to collect grain, causing grain prices to skyrocket. Millions of peasants in the northern Mingshan area are already eating tree bark and grass roots. In areas such as Zhaohua, Guangyuan, Jiange, Tongjiang, Nanjiang, Bazhong, and Wanyuan, miserable cries are everywhere; some are exchanging children to eat, or killing their wives before committing suicide. Counties in the Chengdu Plain, known as the "Granary of Sichuan Province," such as Xindu, Jintang, and Xinfan, have no grain left for the peasants. The disaster in Anhui Province is also extremely severe, and the peasants have no heart to cultivate the land. Northeast Anhui has become a wasteland. Peasants in Jiashan County are only surviving on wild vegetables. In Caili Township, 50 miles from the city, a peasant family of eight tragically died by taking poison one after another because the Chiang-controlled township head forbade them from digging for vegetables. In Wuxi, known as the "Land of Fish and Rice," the peasants have been so plundered that nine out of ten households are empty. They are selling their fertile land one after another, but even though the price has been reduced from ten *shi* of rice per *mu* to five *shi*, there are still no buyers. The excessive levies in eastern Hebei have forced peasants to give away their land for free, and they still have to write a deed. Grain shortages have also occurred in Shenyang, Andong, and southern Liaoning in the Northeast. In the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas of northern Henan and northern Huaihe, corpses of the starved are seen everywhere.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, May 28th. A Shanghai newspaper analysis of the rural bankruptcy situation in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas stated: Land is accelerating its concentration into the hands of bureaucratic and commercial capital. The number of owner-cultivators has sharply decreased, while the number of tenant farmers has drastically increased. For example, in ten villages in Baoding, Hebei, 1.7 percent of the peasant households are landlords and rich peasants, but they own 41.3 percent of the cultivated land. The poor and hired peasants, accounting for 65.2 percent of the total number of households, only own 25.9 percent of the cultivated land. In Pinghu, Zhejiang, landlords account for 3 percent of the total population, but own 80 percent of the cultivated land. In 21 villages in Wuxi, out of 1,035 households, landlords and rich peasants, accounting for 10.3 percent of the population, own 65 percent of the cultivated land, while the poor and hired peasants, accounting for 68.9 percent, only cultivate 14.2 percent of the land. Land concentration is even more severe in Sichuan. Near Chongqing, tenant farmers account for more than 80 percent of the total number of peasants. In Xikang, the land occupied by landlords has increased from 69 percent to 73 percent. Statistically, in the entire Chiang Kai-shek controlled area, the poor and hired peasants, accounting for 73 percent of the rural population, only own 17 percent of the cultivated land, while the landlords, accounting for 4 percent of the rural population, own more than 70 percent of the land. Coupled with inflation, land tax in kind, and high-interest loans, the peasants' livelihood is becoming increasingly difficult. According to statistics from various regions in 1946, the average land rent in Yunnan, Xikang, Guizhou, and Shaanxi has increased to 60 percent of the normal yield. The situation is worst in Sichuan, where Chiang Kai-shek's "wartime capital" was located. In Lingchang, land rent has increased to 80 percent, and in the Chengdu Plain, it has increased to 90 percent, with the average land rent increasing to 80 percent of the total normal yield. Some even have to hand over all of their agricultural products to the landlords. In the northern countryside of Wuxi, known as the land of fish and rice, owner-cultivators often lose money. As a result, those who rent land are returning the land to the landlords one after another. Under these harsh living conditions, those who are capable flee to the cities, and those who are unable to do so resort to desperation. Coupled with the urgent conscription of soldiers, there is a severe shortage of rural population, and fields are left uncultivated, leading to a rural depression and economic bankruptcy.

　　强征强购军粮造成灾荒
  　蒋管区饥民载道
  　四川北部数百万农民吃树皮草根
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】综合沪报讯：蒋介石在各地强征强购军粮，已造成蒋管区之严重灾荒，号称“天府之国”的四川，由蒋记粮食部督察团开赴各县坐收，粮价随即上涨如飞，北部名山一带数百万农民，已在吃树皮草根。昭化、广元、剑阁、通江、南江、巴中、万源一带，哀鸿遍野，有易子而食或先杀妻而自杀者。素称“川省谷仓”之成都平原各县，如新都、金堂、新繁等地，农民已无粒米余剩。皖省灾情也极惨重，农民均无心耕种，皖东北已成一片荒地，嘉山县农民仅以野菜渡日，距该城五十里之蔡里乡，一农民因蒋记乡长不准挖菜，一家八口遂先后服毒惨死。“鱼米之乡”的无锡，农民已被搜刮得十室九空，纷纷出卖良田，每亩代价虽由十石米减至五石，仍无人问津。冀东摊派之苛重，使农民将田白送人家，还须写送契。其他如东北之沈阳、安东、辽南均发生粮荒。豫北蒋管区及淮北遍野饿殍。
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】沪报月前分析蒋管区农村破产情形称：蒋管区土地加速集中于官僚资本与商业资本之手，自耕农锐减，而佃农激增。如河北保定十村一五六五家地主富农，占农家总数百分之一一点七，但耕地竟占百分之四一点三，占总数百分之六五点二之贫雇农，其耕地仅占百分之二五点九；浙江平湖地主占总人口百分之三，而耕地占百分之八十；无锡二十一村一○三五家中，地主富农以百分之一○点三人口，占耕地百分之六十五，而百分之六八点九之贫雇农，仅耕地百分之一四点二；广东百分之七十四以上农民，仅占耕地百分之十九，但百分之六的地主富农，却占耕地百分之六十六。四川土地集中更甚，重庆附近佃农数占农民总数百分之八十以上；西康地主所占农地已从百分之六九增至百分之七三。如以整个蒋管区统计，占农村人口百分之七三之贫雇农，仅占耕地百分之十七，而占农村人口百分之四的地主，竟拥有百分之七十以上土地；再加上通货膨胀、田赋征实、高利贷等剥削，农民生计更趋困迫。以三十五年各地统计：云南、西康、贵州、陕西平均地租增至正产物十分之六。蒋记“陪都”所在地四川，情形最劣，陵昌地租加至八成，成都平原增至九成，平均地租增至正产物总额十分之八，甚至有将农产品全数缴给地主者。素称鱼米之乡的江南无锡北乡，自耕农时常赔本，因之租田者纷纷将田还给地主，在此恶劣之生活情况下，有力者逃向都市，无力者挺而走险，再加上紧急征兵，农村人口奇缺，田园荒芜，以致造成农村萧条，经济破产之局。
