(This report from Taiyue, 8th) The masses in Shangliang Village, Jiexiu County, dispelled their concerns about the enemy situation and created a model of integrating guerrilla warfare and land reform. After the enemy's surprise attacks several times last September, nine-tenths of the masses in the village hid outside the village, and many cadres and militiamen also left the village. After the leadership proposed carrying out a two-in-one movement of guerrilla warfare and land reform in March this year, the village first conducted deliberations among cadres, militiamen, and activists. On April 1st, cadres and activists of the village held a meeting in Qiangbei Village. The cadres of the farmers' association first analyzed the surrounding enemy situation, explaining that the enemy was not stronger than before, and as long as we strengthened the struggle against the enemy, land reform could be carried out, breaking the cadres' and activists' concerns about the enemy situation. The next day, they organized the masses to settle accounts with the landlords and established a "Farmers' Liquidation Committee," cooperating with the militia to take turns on sentry duty, holding struggle meetings in concentrated form during the day, and dispersing and hiding at night, while the militia went out to capture the targets of struggle. Cadres and activists gathered to study and arrange the struggle for the next day. The number of people participating in the liquidation increased day by day. At the beginning, in addition to the militia cadres and activists, only sixteen farmers participated, but the next day it increased to twenty-eight, and by the end of the struggle, the number had increased to more than one hundred and fifty people. After twenty-three days of land distribution struggle, the farmers recovered 160 mu of land. Adding the fruits of the past three struggles, a total of 963 mu of land was obtained. After the farmers obtained land, thirteen people joined the militia and cooperated with the local guerrillas to repel the enemy's attack. On one occasion, two battalions of enemies from three strongholds including Zhanglan, Hongshan, and Qidong attacked the village. The militiamen of the nearby joint defense villages came to reinforce, and the masses of the village also actively and boldly fought, repelling the enemy. Since then, the confidence of the masses in the whole village in the struggle against the enemy has greatly increased, pushing the land reform movement forward.

　　介休上梁群众
    加强对敌斗争  贯彻土地改革
    【本报太岳八日电】介休上梁村群众解除敌情顾虑，创造了游击战争与土地改革两位一体的范例。该村自去年九月敌人奔袭数次后，十分之九的群众躲出村外，干部民兵亦多离开本村。今年三月领导上提出开展游击战与土地改革两位一体的运动后，该村便首先在干部民兵与积极分子中进行酝酿。四月一日，该村干部与积极分子在枪背村开会，农会干部首先分析周围敌情，说明敌人并不比以前强大，只要我们加强对敌斗争，土地改革是能进行的，打破了干部与积极分子的敌情顾虑。第二天便组织群众向地主清算，并成立“农民清算委员会”，配合民兵轮流放哨，白天集中开斗争会，夜间分散隐蔽，而民兵则出去抓捕斗争对象，干部与积极分子集会研究布置第二日的斗争。参加清算的人一天比一天增多。开始除民兵干部与积极分子外，仅有十六个农民参加，第二天即增至廿八个，至斗争结束时，人数便增为一百五十余人。经过二十三天的分田斗争，农民收回一百六十亩土地，加上过去三次斗争的果实，共计九百六十三亩，农民获得土地后，有十三人参加了民兵，并配合当地游击队击退敌人的进攻。某次，张兰、洪山、七洞等三个据点敌人两营向该村进攻，附近各联防村民兵均来增援，该村群众也积极大胆作战，将敌击退。从此全村群众对敌斗争信心倍增，使土地改革运动向前推进一步。
