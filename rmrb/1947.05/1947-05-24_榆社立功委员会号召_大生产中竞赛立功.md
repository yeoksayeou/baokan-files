　　Yushe Merit Committee Calls for
    Merit-Earning Competition in the Great Production Drive
    [Reported by Our Newspaper] The Yushe Merit Committee calls on all cadres and masses in the county to add merit upon merit in the great production movement and win another great victory, stating: "Since last year, our county's farmers and all cadres have served the people with utter devotion in the great land reform movement. Through united and active struggle, we have thoroughly eliminated feudalism and realized 'land to the tiller,' establishing indelible achievements, building great merit, and winning a victory. Now, in the midst of the intense self-defense war and the unfolding great production movement, we still need to maintain this enthusiasm and spirit from our liberation, continue to struggle, promote new heroism, and exert all our talents to serve the people, continue to earn merit, and strive for an even faster victory in the self-defense war. Therefore, we specifically call on all our masses and cadres at all levels to universally launch a merit-earning competition in the self-defense war and great production movement, win victory after victory, and add merit upon merit. We call on cadres to organize and lead the masses to actively produce, achieving 'three years of farming with one year's surplus,' raise the consciousness of the masses, actively participate in the war effort to support the front lines, promote a democratic work style, and maintain close ties with the masses. We call on workers, farmers, and merchants to actively produce and save, participate in the war effort to support the front lines, unite with the masses, and unite with the cadres. The county has therefore established a Merit Committee, responsible for the reporting, recording, evaluation, and congratulation of merit for cadres and the masses. We hope everyone will enthusiastically respond to the call and win another great victory in the great production movement, winning victory after victory, and adding merit upon merit."
