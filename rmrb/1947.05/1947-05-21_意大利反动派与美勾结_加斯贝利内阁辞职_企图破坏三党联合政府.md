Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, May 17th: TASS, Rome: On the morning of the 13th of this month, Italian Prime Minister Gasperi called on President Niccolai to inform him of his intention to resign without presenting the domestic financial and economic situation to the Constituent Assembly. According to reports, President Niccolai refused Gasperi's resignation and instructed him to attend the Constituent Assembly in accordance with the resolution of the Council of Ministers. On the morning of the same day, Gasperi convened an emergency cabinet meeting, declaring that since the Socialist Party Gazette had criticized his actions as a trick intended to change the balance of power within the government, he could not attend the Constituent Assembly. Gasperi also stated that he had decided to immediately submit the resignation of the entire cabinet and that he would immediately call on the President. After the meeting, Socialist Party ministers told reporters that Gasperi's actions were an attempt to shift the responsibility for the government crisis onto the Socialist Party; however, it was Gasperi himself who wanted the government crisis. Minister Silini declared that, despite the cabinet's resignation, Gasperi must report to the Constituent Assembly because the government is responsible to the Constituent Assembly for the domestic situation. The Times commented on Gasperi's resignation, saying: "This step can only be interpreted as a desire to end the tripartite coalition system in order to obtain foreign loans." Roman political figures have called the attention of Italians to the fact that the government crisis coincided with the arrival of the US Export-Import Bank's delegation to Italy.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, May 17th: According to TASS, Rome: Just as the reactionaries were rejoicing over the crisis in the Italian government, Italian Communist leader Togliatti (i.e., Ercoli) recently wrote a commentary in the Italian Communist Party's newspaper *Unità*, commenting on the resignation of the Gasperi cabinet. Togliatti said: "The current crisis undoubtedly constitutes part of a broad offensive by the financial groups against democracy." Togliatti continued: "Here, we first tell our colleagues—the Christian Democrats—that the shame of the 1921-22 crisis that opened the way for fascism cannot and will not be repeated. Regarding the government's program, we all, or almost all, agreed to this program to some extent and regarded it as a starting point for reaching a rapid agreement." At the same time, the reactionaries and the organs of the reactionary parties hailed the Italian government crisis, hoping for US support. *Il Tempo* assured that the United States would provide "substantial loans," which encouraged them to stubbornly demand the establishment of a government without the participation of the Communist Party. The leader of the Liberal Party's parliamentary group, Kerding, in a statement to a reporter from a news agency, welcomed the outbreak of the crisis and opposed any Communist participation in the government. The attitude of the Christian Democrats is not yet very clear. Christian Democratic parliamentarian Sargin told the press that the Christian Democratic parliamentary group predicted the possible formation of a government without Gasperi, with former Prime Minister Bonomi as Prime Minister and Grucci as Deputy Prime Minister.

　　意大利反动派与美勾结  加斯贝利内阁辞职
    企图破坏三党联合政府
    【新华社陕北十七日电】塔斯社罗马讯：本月十三日晨意总理加斯贝利晋谒总统尼科莱告以彼拟不向立宪会议陈述国内财政经济情况即行辞职。据报载，尼科莱总统拒绝加斯贝利辞职，嘱其遵照日前部长会议之决议出席立宪会议。加斯贝利于是日上午招集内阁紧急会议，宣称社会党公报既已批评他的行动为意图改变政府内力量均衡的诡计，他便不能出席立宪会议。加氏并称，他决定立即提出全体内阁辞职，并且他立即晋谒总统。会后，社会党部长们告诉各记者说：加斯贝利的行动，是企图把政府危机的责任推在社会党身上；然而正是加斯贝利他自己想要政府危机。西里尼部长宣称，尽管内阁辞职，加斯贝利必须向立宪会议陈述，因为政府是对立宪会议负国内局势之责的。十三日立宪会议开会历时仅数分钟，待加斯贝利宣称代表内阁全体提出辞职后，立即闭会。时报评论加斯贝利辞职说：“他这一步骤只能解释作意欲结束三党联合政制，以谋获得外国贷款。”罗马政界人士唤起意人注意：政府危机恰与美国进出口银行访意使团之到来同时发生。
    【新华社陕北十七日电】据塔斯社罗马讯：正当反动分子对意大利政府的危机表示欢忭之际，意共领袖托格里亚蒂（按即爱尔科里）顷在意共机关报《团结》报上撰写时评，评论加斯贝利内阁之辞职。托氏谓：“目前的危机无疑地构成了财阀们对民主主义广泛攻势的一部分。”托氏继称：“在这里，我们首先告诉我们的同僚——基督教民主党人，给法西斯主义开辟了道路的一九二一——二二年危机的耻辱，是不能而且将不会重演了。关于政府的纲领，我们全体或几乎是全体都多少同意了这个纲领，并且把它当作能够迅速获致协议的起点。”同时，反动分子们和反动党派的机关报则欢呼意大利的政府危机，希望美国的支持。坦波报保证美国会给予“大量贷款”，他们为此所鼓励，顽固地要求成立没有共产党参加的政府。自由党议会党团领袖克尔丁在其向某新闻社记者发表的声明中，欢迎危机爆发，反对任何共产党人参加政府。基督教民主党的态度尚未十分明确，该党议员萨金向报界说，基督教民主党议会党团预测可能成立一个没有加斯贝利参加而以前总理波诺米为总理，格鲁奇为副总理的政府。
