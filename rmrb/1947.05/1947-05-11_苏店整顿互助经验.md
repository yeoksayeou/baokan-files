　　Experiences in Rectifying Mutual Aid in Su Village
    Lin Tang, Xing Fu, Han Qing
    Rectifying mutual aid groups also requires boldness and a free hand. First and foremost, respect the demands of the mutual aid group members, thoroughly resolve the leftover issues from last year, and genuinely achieve voluntary association, paving the way for the development and improvement of mutual aid groups.
    When Su Village began to rectify mutual aid, although there were many problems, those leading the mutual aid groups were still keeping them to themselves. For example, in Wei Xiaohai's group in the North Street, out of nine households, seven were determined to withdraw from the group, but he still said, "We don't have any problems." Lao Ying and Bi Eryun said, "There's nothing wrong with my group, it's just that everyone doesn't seem as energetic as last year." Later, the problems were finally clarified. In summary, they were: 1. Wages before the autumn harvest were not cleared, and there were no work records during the autumn harvest and autumn plowing. The hired laborers were anxious, while those who owed labor kept silent. 2. Two groups shared three livestock, and there were many disagreements about their use and fodder distribution. 3. The original stipulation was to divide the earned wages and family income on a 3/7 basis, but no one received any money. 4. Two large carts and four small carts went to Handan for transportation, but the accounts were not settled. 5. Bi Eryun's prizes won at the Hero Conference were not clearly announced. Group members reflected, "We earned glory for Eryun, why didn't you say anything if there were problems?" Bi Eryun said during his self-criticism: "I thought we were a model group, and if there were problems, other groups would laugh at us, so I planned to drag it out." Du Qisheng said, "I was afraid of offending people and didn't want to mention it. I wanted to leave the group a long time ago, but if the problems are solved, I won't leave the group."
    After deliberation and discussion, Bi Eryun's group was praised for discovering many problems and being a good group, breaking the confused ideas of fearing the collapse of the group and fearing to offend people. All the problems of each group were then fully exposed and resolved.
    Among the leftover problems, the most common was the wage issue. In the thirteen groups in the South Street, eight groups had wage problems. Secondly, there were some opinions about labor conversion calculation and living arrangements in each group. While solving the problems, new mutual aid groups were established at the same time. Huang Quanshui's group cleared the wages at night and paid them in cash the next day; and new wages were determined, with frequent accounting to avoid arrears. For those with unclear work records, everyone discussed and estimated, thoroughly clearing them up without leaving any loose ends. Du Qiuhe's group adopted the experience of not being able to settle accounts and issued work tickets based on shifts. All groups criticized the malpractice of calculating labor based on fixed points and implemented calculating labor based on actual work done. Regarding opinions involving the leadership, cadres and group leaders made self-criticisms face to face. For example, Bi Eryun said: "The heroes and models are all due to everyone's efforts." It was immediately explained that all the prizes would be returned to the whole group, but the group members voluntarily gave the black cloth to the hero to compensate for his lost work time, thus further strengthening the relationship between the hero and the masses.
    During the rectification, voluntary association was earnestly achieved. Very few of the thirty-eight groups rectified in the whole village remained unchanged. Chou Ren said, "I not only look for the right people, but also choose good leaders!"
    After the rectification, it was further proven that the groups that discussed and solved all the problems, and were truly voluntarily combined, had great enthusiasm.
    In addition to thoroughly solving the leftover problems, the most important thing in rectifying mutual aid is to establish and improve the peasants' organizational awareness, from poverty to prosperity, and mutual assistance and mutual benefit.
    When Su Village began to organize mutual aid last year, fifty-one groups were organized within a few days, accounting for more than 80% of the households in the whole village. This was a concrete manifestation of the peasants' enthusiasm after being liberated in response to the call. But there was some blindness here, so many groups collapsed after the spring plowing and sowing. After a year of mutual aid production, peasants only relied on intuition and had many illusions about being organized. The most common were that mutual aid had benefits and burdens, or that mutual aid benefited the elderly, widowed, and disabled households, benefited the lazy, and benefited the cadres. Therefore, participating in mutual aid this year was no longer as casual as last year. Those who had benefited were very active, while those who had been burdened were unwilling to participate in mutual aid. Middle peasant Liu Fa said, "I can do mutual aid, or I can not do mutual aid," but in reality, he was unwilling to do mutual aid. Many old men and women in the whole village were squeezed out and could not join the groups. Some people also believed that mutual aid was a public affair and had to be done. An old woman in the South Street said, "If I didn't have to do mutual aid, I wouldn't."
    To solve these confused ideas and establish organizational awareness, Su Village used the method of comparative accounting. Within the mutual aid group, on the one hand, they summarized whether the mutual aid last year was beneficial or detrimental. For some who had actually suffered losses, was it because the organization was not good, or was the method wrong? On the other hand, they recalled whether it was good or bad to take care of themselves (individual production) in the old society, and compared it with mutual aid. This greatly improved their own temporary illusions about mutual aid using the peasants' own long-term personal experience, and it was very effective. Niu Yonggui in the East Street said, "Every family has a vegetable garden. In the past, whether it was thirty or twenty pounds, they all had to carry it to sell themselves, which was time-consuming and expensive. Last year, the group assigned one person to be in charge of selling vegetables (for the whole group), saving a lot of labor and expenses. Mutual aid weeding saved the whole group eighty workdays, and everyone was satisfied." Jiao Genfa said, "I am convinced by the mutual aid group. In the past, I smoked opium and didn't get out of bed until noon. Participating in mutual aid for a year has improved me. In the past, the grass on my few acres of land was taller than the grain, and I couldn't plow the stubble after autumn. Last year, everything was done well. Furthermore, like Yuan Xiaotu, who was sick for several months last year, the mutual aid group helped him do his land. If everyone took care of themselves, who would care about him?" Zhang Chounv said, "Mutual aid is like a machine. Six people planting corn together in shifts can also take care of three acres." Zhu Fuxi said, "My group calculates labor based on actual work done, and everyone is energetic. I, Chou Ren, and Zengfu got up early and cut five acres of corn, earning fifteen pounds of rice (three pounds per acre)." Zhu Dan said, "I joined a group in the spring and planted six and a third acres of wheat, which cost twenty-one shifts of labor. I felt it was a loss and left the group. People looked at their lives and did more to make up for it. No one benefited. The loss was due to not having good leadership and the wrong method." This greatly improved the peasants' understanding of being organized, believing that mutual aid was beneficial to everyone and made everyone rich, and participating in mutual aid became a more conscious action.
    Improving organizational consciousness cannot be done all at once, but is a long-term experience process of continuous summarization and education (calculating the results of mutual aid) and gradually improving leadership (more equitable and reasonable, more democratic leadership, more voluntary combination).

　　苏店整顿互助经验
    林堂　行夫　汉清
    整顿互助组也需要大胆放手，首先是尊重互助组成员的要求，彻底解决去年遗留问题，并真正做到自愿结合，给互助组的发展与提高铺平道路。
    苏店开始整顿互助，虽有许多问题，但领导互助组的人却还闷在肚里。如北街魏小孩组，共九户就有七户决心退组，可是他还说：“我们这个没问题。”劳英毕二云说：“我那组也没啥，就是感到大家没有去年劲大。”后来终于把问题搞明白，总起来说，有：一、秋前工资末清，秋收秋耕中连工账也没有，长工的着急，欠工的不吭气。二、两组伙着三个牲口，使用及摊草料意见很多。三、原规定把赚下工资和家庭三七分红，结果分文未得。四、两辆大车四辆小车下邯郸运输一次，没算清账。五、二云在群英会上所得奖品，没给明白宣布，组员反映：咱是给二云争了光荣，有问题为啥不说呢。毕二云在检讨时说：我想咱是模范组，出了问题，别组耻笑，就打算拖下去。杜起盛说：“我是怕得罪人，不愿提，早想跳组哩；解决了问题，我也就不跳组了。”
    经酝酿讨论，表扬了毕二云组发现问题多，还是好组，打破了怕垮组、怕惹人等糊涂思想。各组问题才全部发掘出来，并得到解决。
    遗留问题中，最普遍的是工资问题。南街十三个组，即有八个组存在工资问题，其次折工计工，生活安排，各组都有一些意见。与解决问题同时，即建立新互助组，黄全水组，黑夜把工资算清，第二天即过现付清；并确定了新工资，以后勤算账，不拖欠。工账不清的，也由大家讨论估计，彻底清理，不留尾巴。杜秋和组，接受算不清账的经验，搭晌制出工票，各组都批判了按死分计工的毛病，实行以活计工。涉及领导的意见，干部、组长当面做自我检讨。如毕二云说：英雄模范都是大家的功劳。当即说明把所有奖品归全组，但该组员又自动把黑布拥护给英雄，照顾其误工，这样进一步密切了英雄与群众关系。
    整顿中，切实做到了自愿结合。全村整顿起来的三十八组，很少是原封原样的。丑仁说：“我不是光找对势人，还挑选好领导人哩！”
    经过整顿，更证明了那一组把问题都谈透解决了，又是真正自愿结合，那一组的劲头就很大。
    整顿互助，除彻底解决遗留的问题外，更重要的是树立与提高农民组织起来，由穷变富、互助互利的组织自觉思想。
    苏店去年开始组织互助时，几天内便组织起五十一组，户数占全村百分之八十以上，这是农民翻身后一股热情响影号召的具体表现。但这里却存在一些盲目性，所以在春耕下种后，就垮了不少。经过一年互助生产，农民只凭直感，对组织起来产生不少错觉。最普遍的是互助有光沾，有背伤，或认为互助起来孤寡无劳力户沾光，懒汉沾光，干部沾光，因而今年参加互助，就不再像去年那样马虎。沾过光的很积极，背过伤的就不愿参加互助。中农刘发则说：“我是互也行，不互也行”，实际是不愿互助。全村有不少的老汉妇女被挤出来，入不了组。也有人认为互助是公事，不能不办，南街一个老婆说：“要非互不行，我也不能不互。”
    解决这些糊涂观念，树立组织自觉思想，苏店是用对比算账的办法，在互助组内，一面总结去年互助是沾光还是吃亏。有些实际吃了亏的是组织起来不好，还是办法不对？一面回忆旧社会的各顾各（个体生产）好不好，与互助起来作对比。这种用农民自己长期的亲身体验，打通了自己对互助的一时错觉，收效很大。东街牛永贵说：“家家有菜园，过去不管三十斤、廿斤，都靠自己挑上卖，费工多盘费大，去年由组抽出一人专管卖菜（全组），不知节省多少工和盘费。互助耨地，全组省工八十个，人人满意。”焦根发说：“我算服气了互助组，以前我抽料面，半晌不起床，参加互助一年把我带好了，我那几亩地，过去草比谷高，秋后垡不了茬，去年样样搞的好。再说像原小秃去年害病几月，互助组给他把地做好，要是各顾各、谁管他呢？”张臭女说：“互助起来就是机器，六个人种玉茭搭晌，就捎了三亩。”朱福喜说：“我那组按活计工，大家都有劲，我和臭仁、增福起早割了五亩玉茭，就赚十五斤米（一亩三斤）。”朱旦则说：“我春天参加一组，种六亩三分大麦，就费了二十一晌工，我嫌吃亏跳了组，人家是看生活，多做多顶，谁也沾光，吃亏是怨没领导好，办法不对。”这样大大提高了农民对组织起来的认识，相信互助是大家沾光、大家发财，参加互助就成为比较自觉的行动了。
    提高组织自觉，不可能一下子做好，而是互助起来不断进行总结教育（算互助成果账）和逐渐改善领导（等价更合理，领导更民主，结合更自愿）的长期体验过程。
