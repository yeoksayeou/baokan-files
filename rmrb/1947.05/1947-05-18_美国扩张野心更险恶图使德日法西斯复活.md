　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th. According to the U.S. Information Service: U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Acheson delivered a speech in Cleveland on the 8th. The speech once again fully exposed the aggressive ambitions of U.S. imperialism to actively expand outward by means of its monetary power. The first sentence of his speech, as clear as day, was: "In the coming years, the United States must continue to provide foreign aid." The so-called "aid" is a synonym for "expansion." Acheson, blinded by arrogance, predicted the beautiful prospects of U.S. imperialism's outward expansion, saying: "Further requests for assistance from various countries to the United States will come one after another through the International Bank, the Export-Import Bank, or directly through diplomatic channels." "This requires our diplomatic policy to take more urgent steps." What is the diplomatic policy of the gold standard empire? He also made it very clear: "One of the main objectives of our foreign policy today is to use our economic and financial resources to expand our narrow economic scope." In order to facilitate the implementation of this expansionist policy, he said: "After June 30, Congress must continue the government's control over certain domestic matters." One point in Acheson's speech is even more noteworthy, namely, his unreserved exposure of the U.S. imperialist conspiracy to support the revival of the remnants of German and Japanese fascism. He said: The United States "wants to promote the reconstruction of the two major factories (Germany and Japan) in Europe and Asia."

　　美国扩张野心更险恶图使德日法西斯复活
    【新华社陕北十四日电】据美新闻处讯：美副国务卿亚泽逊顷于八日在克利夫兰发表演说。该演说又一次充分暴露了美帝国主义图借金元力量积极向外扩张的侵略野心。他演说的开宗明义第一句，就是：“今后数年内，美国必须继续对外救济。”所谓“救济”就是“扩张”的同义语。亚泽逊冲昏头脑的预测着美帝国主义对外扩张的美妙远景，他说：“各国对美之进一步援助要求，将由国际银行、进出口银行或直接经由外交途径，纷至沓来。”“此事使吾人之外交政策更应采取紧急步骤。”金元帝国的外交政策是什么呢？他也说的很明白：“今日吾人外交政策主要目的之一，在于运用吾人之经济与金融、资源，以扩充狭隘之经济范围。”为了便利实行这种扩张政策，他说：“国会在六月三十日以后，必须继续政府对国内的若干统制。”在亚泽逊演词中有一点更值得注意的，就是他供认不讳的暴露了美帝国主义扶植德日法西斯残余复活的阴谋。他说：美国“要推动欧亚两洲二大工厂（德日两国）之重建。”
