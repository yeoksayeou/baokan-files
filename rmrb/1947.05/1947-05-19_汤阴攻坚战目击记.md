　　Eyewitness Account of the Tangyin Campaign
    Our Correspondent Ke Gang

    This was May 1, 1947. General Liu Bocheng's victorious troops were to slay the poisonous snake that had been sucking the blood and fat of the people for thirty years – the bandit gang of Sun Dianying and its lair, the city of Tangyin. At 3:15 AM, I, as a reporter, followed the supreme commander of the 67th unit, braving the drizzling spring rain, into the command post shelter 200 meters from the city. As we passed through the communication trenches, troop shelters, machine gun emplacements, and artillery positions, the slogan "Strive to make great contributions, capture Sun Dianying alive" was being whispered among the officers and soldiers. The command post was set up in a fairly solid bunker that we had captured yesterday. The telephone operator was using the nails where the enemy had hung their guns to erect telephone lines, which were connected to various positions. The commander was a thoughtful person. His guard told me that he had always been like this. As soon as he entered the command post, he would start thinking like he was writing an article, smoking and thinking non-stop. Apart from ordering the troops how to attack and shoot, he did not speak to others or smile. But now, he put down the receiver and, exceptionally, smiled. And he said to me: "Look, there's still half an hour before the general attack, but all the combatants are asking to attack immediately. They say they are ready and really don't want to wait. It's really innocently endearing." The pre-war silence was brewing a fierce battle. The fine rain fell silently. Many raindrops gathered on the rolling logs and thunderstones on the battlements, and on the landmines and barbed wire at the edge of the trenches. Various gun barrels stretched out from the honeycomb-like gun holes in the city wall. The red tassels of the spears that the enemy intended to use for hand-to-hand combat were exposed on the city wall, swaying quietly. All the troops, more than 9,000 soldiers, who were being deceived by Sun Dianying's treacherous means, were stationed in the city of Tangyin, which was only two Chinese miles in diameter. How crowded it must have been.

    A large amount of steel pressed down from the air; this was at 5:30 AM. The artillery positions kept roaring. In just twenty minutes, the section of the city wall that Sun Dianying had telegraphed to Li Zhenqing (commander of the Chiang Kai-shek's 40th Army) in Anyang a few days ago, claiming that the People's Liberation Army would never be able to break through, had been blasted open with two large breaches in the northeast corner. The enemy was indeed very stubborn. From the bunker of the command post, I saw from afar a row of shells pass by, and a platoon of enemies and bricks and stones flew up violently with the thick black smoke. Then Sun Dianying used the bodies of another platoon to block the breach. At this breach, the venomous Sun Dianying bandit gang threw the flesh and blood of an entire company into the sky filled with drizzling rain. The breach grew larger and larger. When night came, the rain stopped, and the moon gradually rose. Shells of various calibers exploded even more fiercely. In the enemy's depths, Jin Yushan of the 679th unit, Song Haiqing of the 666th unit, and others, led their assault teams and climbed onto the city along the breaches. On the city, the bandit gang, who were preparing for a bayonet fight, were extremely vicious. They fired a volley of sulfur bombs before counterattacking. When our combatants were covered in green flames, they suddenly pounced over. In this way, the people's heroes, amid bursts of shouts and flashes of fire, repelled eleven enemy counterattacks after forty minutes of fighting. Many people's clothes were burnt. When platoon leader Chen Yongfu's hand was burnt, he stabbed three enemies in a row. At this time, the Party Committee of the 666th unit awarded each of Song Haiqing's assault team members a major merit. The commendation list was sent to the smoke-filled battlefield by a special envoy, read aloud in public, and immediately posted on the breach in the city wall. Just then, they captured enemy soldier Li Zhongpu. Ding Xinzhang, the political instructor of Song Haiqing's assault team, immediately asked him why he was so stubbornly resisting. He said, "After the artillery blasted open the breach in the city wall, the commander-in-chief ordered that whoever could hold the breach would be rewarded with 500,000 silver dollars."

    During the repeated fighting, the 684th unit, which had temporarily withdrawn from the city on × month 17, 1945, due to the large-scale northward invasion by the Chiang Kai-shek troops, fulfilled their promise to the people in the city and bravely attacked the city. The soldiers rushed down the city wall with the force of autumn wind sweeping away fallen leaves. The enemy, who had been badly beaten, had no confidence in house-to-house combat. Although their bandit officers pointed their pistols at the back of their heads, they laid down their weapons in groups as the houses they occupied were surrounded one by one.

    The army of the working people was like a large pair of iron pincers: advancing section by section, one route to the northwest, and one route to the southeast. Before the sun rose on May 2, this pair of iron pincers finally clamped the neck of Chiang Kai-shek's puppet army, Sun Dianying. All the officers and soldiers of Sun's unit were captured.

    When men and women, old and young, crowded the streets to watch the prisoners march out of the city in a line, peddler Li San and his wife pointed to me with joy: Sun Dianying's office is here. I saw telegram number 174 sent by Gu Zhutong on April 30, which read: "Commander Sun: Your unit has fought bravely for many days, repeatedly thwarting fierce attacks. Details have been reported to Chairman Chiang, who is very pleased. He sent a telegram saying: 'Commander Sun Dianying's attack on the Communist army is highly commendable. Tangyin is a strategic key point in northern Henan, and it must be firmly defended to achieve complete success.' I am sending this message to you and hope that you will telegraph the battle situation at any time. Gu Zhutong, Zhengzhou, 30th" Upon reading this, I, as a reporter, couldn't help but laugh.

　　汤阴攻坚战目击记
    本报记者  柯岗
    这是一九四七年五月一日，刘伯承将军所部常胜军，要在这一天斩杀三十年来吮吸人民血脂而生存的毒蛇——孙殿英匪帮及其魔窟汤阴城。三点一刻，记者随六七部队最高指挥员冒着霏霏春雨，进入距城二百公尺的指挥所掩护部内。当我们经过交通沟、屯兵壕、机枪掩体和炮兵阵地的时候，“争取立大功、活捉孙殿英”的口号，正被指战员们低声传送着。指挥所设在昨天被我攻占的一座相当坚固的碉堡内，电话员利用着敌人挂枪的钉子架起电线，拉到各个阵地上去。指挥员是个喜欢思考的人。他的警卫员告诉我，他从来就是这样，只要一进指挥所，就像作文章一样，不停的吸烟，不停的想。除掉命令队伍怎样去进攻和射击之外，不和别人说话，也不笑。然而他现在放下听筒，破例的笑了。并且对我说：你看现在距总攻时间还有半点钟，可是所有的战斗员们都要求立刻攻击，他们说已经准备好了，实在不愿等待了，真是天真的可爱。战前的静寂，酝酿着激剧的厮杀，细雨无声的飘落，城垛口的雷石滚木、壕边的拉雷和铁丝上都凝聚了许多雨珠。城墙上蜂巢一样的枪眼里，伸出了各种各样的枪口。敌人打算用来肉搏的长矛红缨显露在城头，静静的摆动。现在被孙殿英的奸恶手段愚弄着的全部人马九千多个士兵，统统驻扎在直径不过两华里的汤阴城内，该是多么拥挤啊。
    大量的钢铁从空中压下来，这是五点半钟的时候。炮兵阵地上不停的发出轰鸣。只有二十分钟的功夫，在几天以前孙殿英还电告安阳李振清（蒋记四十军军长），认为这是人民解放军保险攻不破的城墙，东北角上已经被轰开了两个大缺口。敌人确实很顽强，我在指挥所的碉堡上远远看到一排炮弹过去，一连敌人和砖砾便随着浓黑的烟幕猛然飞起，于是孙殿英又拿另一连人的肉体来堵塞。在这个缺口，毒恶的孙殿英匪帮把整四连人的血肉都抛在飘着细雨的天空中。缺口越来越大了。夜来的时候雨停了，月亮渐渐升起，各种口径的炮弹更猛烈的爆炸。在敌人的纵深，六七九部队的金玉山、六六六部队的宋海清等，带着他们的突击队员们，顺着缺口登上城去。在城上，准备进行白刃战的匪帮是万分恶毒的，他们在反扑之前先打一排硫磺弹。当我们的战斗员混身冒起绿色火苗的时候，突然扑过来。就这样，人民的英雄们在一阵阵的杀声，一片片的火光里，经四十分钟的格斗，击退了敌人十一次反扑。许多人的衣裳被烧坏了，排长陈永福当他的手背烧着时，一连刺了三个敌人。这时六六六部队党委会给宋海清突击队员们每人记大功一次，报功单被特派员送到烟火漫天的阵地上，当众宣读之后，马上贴到城墙缺口上。正在这时，他们捉住了敌兵李中仆；宋海清突击队的政治指导员丁新章，立时问他为什么这样顽抗？他说：“在大炮轰开城墙缺口以后，总司令命令说谁能守住缺口，赏洋五十万元”。
    正在反复格斗的时候，曾于一九四五年×月十七日由于蒋军大举北犯而暂时撤离该城的六八四部队实践了他们对城内人民的诺言，勇猛打上城去。战士们冲下城墙，势如秋风扫落叶。被打痛了的敌人，对于逐屋战是毫无信心的，尽管他们的匪官用手枪对准他们的后脑，但当他们占据的家屋一座一座被包围的时候，他们便一群群的放下武器。
    劳动人民的军队像一把大铁钳子：一路向西北，一路向东南，节节前进。五月二日的太阳尚未升起，这把大铁钳子终于夹住了蒋伪军孙殿英的脖子。孙逆所部官兵全部就擒。
    当全城的男女老小挤满街旁，争看俘虏排队出城的时候，小贩李三和他妻子喜笑颜开的指给我：孙殿英的办公室在这里。我看到顾祝同四月三十日发来的一七四号的电报，上面写着：“孙司令：贵部奋战多日，迭挫凶锋，详情已历呈委座，主席闻之，极为欣慰。顷奉电称：孙司令殿英打击共军，殊堪嘉许；汤阴为豫北战略重点，务必坚守之以竟全功等语。特达，并希将战况随时电告为要。郑州顾祝同三十日”记者读此，不禁失笑。
