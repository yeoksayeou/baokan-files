　　Jinan-North Qinggou Area
  　Distributing Land While Fighting
    [Our newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 24th dispatch] In the Qinggou area of northern Jinan, land is being distributed while fighting. Initially, the cadres lacked confidence, believing that the enemy frequently came to the vicinity to demand grain and money, that the bad landlords in the area were secretly aiding the enemy, that democratic order had not been established, that there was no mass base, and that there were bandit and special agent activities, estimating that the masses would be afraid and would not dare to ask for grain or land. However, after going deep into the masses to understand the situation, the situation was exactly the opposite, all saying, "Nothing is more severe than hunger." The leadership grasped this demand of the masses, leading the distribution of land and grain, and the masses enthusiastically participated, and the morale of the cadres also rose accordingly. When the enemy set out to seize grain, sentries were posted in the village, and the armed working group in the sub-district immediately assembled to intercept them. As soon as the enemy left, they returned to carry out work.
    [Another dispatch] The 896th unit of the × military sub-district has achieved remarkable results in helping the masses in the border area of Ji-Jia (New County) to return land to their homes. Over the past two months, the unit has persisted in guerrilla warfare in the border area and cooperated with local comrades to launch a land-to-the-home movement behind enemy lines. They started with six squads, with each squad taking turns for one week, earnestly ensuring that they worked in each village they went to. Two squads have already worked in five villages, and fifty to sixty poor people have been allocated six hundred mu of land and fifty bags of grain.

　　济北清沟地区
  　一面打仗一面分田
    【本报冀鲁豫二十四日电】济北清沟地区，一边打仗，一边分田。初干部没信心，认为敌人经常到附近催粮催款，这一带的坏地主还暗中资敌，民主秩序未建立，没有群众基础，又有匪特活动，估计群众害怕不敢要粮要地，但深入群众中了解以后，情形恰正相反，都说：“啥厉害也比不上饿厉害”，领导上抓住群众这一要求，领导分地分粮，群众踊跃参加，干部情绪也随之高涨。在敌人抢粮出发时，村里放上哨，小区武装工作组即集合阻击，敌人刚走，又回来进行工作。
    【又电】×分区八九六部队，帮助济嘉（新县）边地群众土地还家，成绩卓著，该部两个月来坚持边地游击战争，并配合地方工作同志，掀起了敌后的土地回家运动，他们先由六小队做起，每小队轮流一星期，切实做到走一村做一村，两个小队已作了五个村子，五六十家贫苦群众分得了田地六百亩，粮食三十口袋。
