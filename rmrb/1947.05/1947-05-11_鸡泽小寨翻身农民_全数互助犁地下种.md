　  Jize Xiaozhai Emancipated Peasants
    All Cooperatively Plow and Sow
    [This newspaper's Jinan dispatch on the 9th] In Jize Xiaozhai village, all 178 households, 175 of which participate in mutual aid, have established twenty-some mutual aid groups, adding 14 head of cattle and 10 donkeys. Of the village's 2,067 mu of spring land, 2,030 mu have already been plowed. 193.5 mu of cotton land have been plowed twice, and planting has begun in individual plots. Sideline production includes as many as 16 varieties: 4,879 jin of saltpeter were leached, worth 300,500 yuan; 220 bolts of military cloth were woven, worth 22,660 jin of grain in wages. It is estimated that the whole village can earn at least one million yuan before the wheat harvest. Dong Lanzhang's group used a 100,000 yuan loan to buy one head of cattle and one donkey each, and repaid the loan with income from leaching saltpeter. The reasons for achieving universal mutual aid this year are: 1. After land reform, each person has at least 4.3 mu of land, demanding mutual aid production to become prosperous. 2. Ideological mobilization is mature. In addition to general appeals, family meetings of 17 or 18 households were held, using precise calculations to get the message across. After cadres took the lead in organizing, a Cattle Production Committee was established to strengthen leadership and solve difficulties. 3. There is last year's experience in mutual aid plowing. The masses have seen the benefits of mutual aid with their own eyes.

　  鸡泽小寨翻身农民
    全数互助犁地下种
    【本报冀南九日电】鸡泽小寨全村一百七十八户，一百七十五户参加互助，成立了二十几个互助组，添牛十四头，驴十头。该村两千零六十七亩春地，已有二千零三十亩犁完。棉花地犁过两遍的已有一百九十三亩半，个别地块已开始下种。副业生产计有十六种之多：淋盐四千八百七十九斤，折款卅万零五千元，织军布二百廿匹，折工资粮二万二千六百六十斤，估计全村麦前至少可收入百万元。董兰章组以十万贷款买牛驴各一头，以淋硝收益还清贷款。今年做到普遍互助原因：一、土地改革后每人至少有了四亩三分土地，要求互助生产，发家致富。二、思想动员成熟，除一般号召外，召开了十七、八户家庭会，以精确计算方法，打通思想，干部带头组织起来后，又成立了牛产委员会，加强领导，解决困难。三、有去年互助拉犁经验，群众亲眼看见互助的好处。
