　　Fascist Tool of Rule
    ——The Kuomintang Defense Ministry's "People's Service Corps"—Its Essence as a Secret Service
    Wǔ Zhōu
    Gu Zhutong, one of the leading henchmen of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique, said in his "Speech to the People's Service Corps" last November: "The task of you all is to counter the Communist Party's strategy of advancing politics through organization and using politics to cover up military operations, and to carry out political 'bandit suppression.'" At the same time, the inaugural issue of the *Qinmin Monthly*, published by the Second Squad of the First Battalion of his Second Corps on January 21st, 1947, also stated: The "People's Service Corps" is a "shock force for promoting party and government work." Its members have all received secret service training at the Chiang Kai-shek Defense Ministry's Cadre Training Class of the News Bureau (currently there are three branches, located in Qijiang and Longchang in Sichuan, and Hangzhou in Zhejiang); our overall understanding of it is: the Chiang Kai-shek Defense Ministry's "People's Service Corps" is a tool of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's utter fascist secret service and bloody rule.

    The Second Corps' *Implementation Measures for the Work Plan* states: "This Corps takes the organization and training of the masses as the basis of all work, and promotes overall work through the organization and training of the masses." In Gu Zhutong's "Speech," when discussing what the "People's Service Corps" actually does, the first thing he proposed was: "Thoroughly investigate household registration and reorganize the Baojia system, ensuring that everyone is registered to a household and every household belongs to a Jia... Issue national identity cards, and according to national identity, separately organize various mass organizations and civic groups." This means that all the common people are to be ruled under this dark and bloody Baojia system; and like the Japanese issuing "good citizen certificates" in their occupied areas, so-called "national identity cards" are issued, restricting the freedom of all people. In the *Work Log* of the Second Squad of the First Battalion from December 9, 1946, to January 30, 1947, it is written on December 20th: "The Baojia system in Jixian County is unsound, resulting in the darkness of administrative organs at all levels and the infiltration of treacherous parties not being taken care of; therefore, a Jixian Youth Work Corps is organized, which is divided into overt and covert types. The overt is the organization and training of able-bodied young men, and the covert is a kind of horizontal secret organization, so that they supervise each other... eliminate bad elements and 'treacherous parties.' Its organization is divided into schools, labor unions, chambers of commerce, farmers' associations, and railway civil servants, etc." This open restriction of people's freedom everywhere, and the secret deployment of secret agents everywhere "so that they supervise each other," is the basic content of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' so-called "organization and training of the masses."

    At the same time, on December 10 (in Xinxiang) and December 23 (in Jixian) in the Second Squad's "Work Log," it is written: "According to a report from Group Nine, Yang Bin, the chief of the test area station of the Eighth Air Force General Station at No. 5 Wangjia Hutong, seems suspicious. After I met with him this evening, he was indeed the chief of the district station, and his attitude was amiable and cordial, and there was absolutely no illegal behavior." (December 10) "There are more than 800 workers in the Huasha Spinning Factory, and female workers account for two-thirds of the total. The chairman of the council, Gao Zeren, is the leader of the labor union squad. This person is slippery in his speech... His actions need to be investigated." In the Second Squad's Fu character No. 417 telegram on March 13, 1947, it broadcasted the "commendation order" for Ouyang Xu, attached to the Third Battalion, and Wang Haodong, attached to the Ninth Squad, for shooting Li Xin× (i.e., Li Shisai), a resident of Xinkouji Village, Chenliu Township, Henan, and for searching and arresting the brothers Zuo Tingbin, Zuo Tinggui, and Zuo Tingdong, and Li Lanting and four other liaison officers of the New Army. In the First Battalion's Zhen secret character No. 611 telegram in March 1947, it was to grant meritorious service to Shu Sheyu, a member of the Fourth Team of the Second Squad, for capturing five suspects, and to report it for "circular commendation."... Enough, the fascist terror rule that the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' "People's Service Corps" has given to the people can be glimpsed from this. Under such a large number of "commendations" and "rewards" for arresting, burying alive, and shooting people, anyone can imagine how many innocent people will be arrested, detained, and slaughtered by them. In fact, under such "commendations" and "rewards," and the large-scale arrest and killing of people, even the people within their own fascist rulers were "innocently" killed by themselves. This is stated in the Second Corps' First Battalion's Zhen secret character No. 635 telegram (in Xinxiang) on March 17, 1947: "According to the order of Commander Liu Bennian on February 14, General character No. (1188): 'According to a report, after the 49th Brigade formerly stationed in Chenbao Town, Xinxiang, was transferred to Kaifeng, a soldier named Li Yihai stayed in the house of Hao Zhenzhang, attached to the Nanzhangmen Bao team. On the ninth day of the lunar second month, he was taken away by Sun Yumin, a member of the Second Squad of the brigade, together with the Bao chief. The soldier claimed to be an intelligence agent of the brigade, but after investigation, there was no evidence, and he was shot dead by Sun Yumin and Ji Yunqing in Kuicun Camp'... etc. According to this joint letter and telegram, please strictly detain and escort the two people, Sun Yumin and Ji Yunqing, to Xinxiang for transfer to the corps" (Note: Ji Yunqing was originally the leader of the Second Group of the First District Team of the Second Squad). This was when they rewarded the large-scale arrest and killing of people, killing their own people, causing internal conflicts, and Sun Yumin and Ji Yunqing had to be "strictly detained and escorted to Xinxiang"; this can also be said to be Sun and Ji's well-deserved "bad luck"! However, under the bloody rule of Chiang Kai-shek's fascist secret service, tens of millions of innocent people are being imprisoned and slaughtered, and "commendations" and "rewards" are still continuing!

    The Chiang Kai-shek bandits' so-called "People's Service Corps" is even more insidious and vicious in its sabotage of our liberated areas; the ninth item, Article 38, in the Second Corps' "Draft Implementation Plan for Assisting in the Suppression of 'Traitorous Bandits'" reads: "Personnel sent by each team into the bandit area should grasp the objective situation and carry out work on the following four points: (1) incite 'surrender and return to righteousness,' (2) incite internal strife and chaos, (3) shake military morale, (4) collect intelligence documents." How worthy this is of our vigilance!

    In addition, the "Homecoming Corps" is organized in the occupied areas of the Chiang army, and "counter-settlement" is carried out against our emancipated peasants as their military invasion proceeds. This has been explained very thoroughly in Gu Zhutong's "Speech to the People's Service Corps." He said: "Recently, there have been organizations of refugee homecoming teams in various places, and we should lead and assist their work." At the same time, he also said: "During the occupation of the Communist army, the original land system was completely destroyed, and the outline was completely different, so after the recovery, there will inevitably be disputes everywhere. When you implement your work in the future, you should also abide by the relevant land provisions of the central government's promulgated Administration Outline for the Pacification Zone and assist in the investigation of property rights." Isn't this clear? The landlords and despots who fled from the liberated areas to the Chiang Kai-shek occupied areas are to be organized and led; and the land reform of "land to the tiller" implemented in the liberated areas is considered to have destroyed the "original land system," and "assisting in the investigation of property rights" is to be implemented, which undoubtedly clearly states: The land that the common people struggled to obtain from the landlords and despots must still be forcibly "returned" to the landlords and despots in the areas occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits! This is the essence of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' "People's Service Corps" so-called "mediation of civil disputes" in the "pacification" zone.

    In short, regarding the Chiang Kai-shek Defense Ministry's "People's Service Corps," this tool of bloody fascist secret service rule, no matter how it talks about "relieving the suffering of the people" and "improving the lives of farmers," under the bloody rule of fascism, the people cannot live; the so-called conscription, apportionment... even its fascist lackeys have to feel a little "flustered" and admit that "the difficulty and suffering of the people's lives is really indescribable." This is written in the Second Squad's "Work Log" on December 29: "The problem of conscription can make me rack my brains, because the able-bodied young men who have been selected by the county government have all run away, and now there are a few able-bodied young men who are orphans who have been grabbed to replace their quotas, so every day there are several grandmothers and sisters-in-law who ask the team headquarters to find a way, and cry and kowtow, which can make me flustered." In addition, Cheng Jian, the leader of the Seventh Group of the Second Squad, wrote in his work weekly report in February 1947: "Prices are rising day by day, especially when the harvest is getting closer and closer, and I don't know where the prices will end up... Take Hu Quanlu, the commander of the Fourth Security Corps, for example... The salaries of his subordinates are completely borne by the people. Each Bao in Junxian County reluctantly pays five big dippers and ten dou of wheat every month. Not only the Baos in Junxian County are like this, but also the counties bordering Junxian are like this. With so many Baos, the amount of grain collected is also incalculable." This is the epitome of the so-called making the people "live and work in peace and contentment" under Chiang Kai-shek's bloody rule.

    This tool of the Chiang Kai-shek feudal fascist rule—the Defense Ministry's "People's Service Corps"—has been confirmed to have formed two corps. The commander of the First Corps is Guo Zhongrong (the corps headquarters is currently stationed in Xuzhou), and the commander of the Second Corps is Liu Peichu (the corps headquarters is currently stationed in Zhengzhou); according to its organizational structure, each corps has about 1,500 people, is fully armed, and are all officers above the rank of second lieutenant. As it stands, this armed fascist secret service organization is large enough; but according to Deng Wenyi, one of the Chiang Kai-shek secret service bosses, in a letter representing Chiang Kai-shek to the "People's Service Corps," he said: "There are more than 30,000 people in the Youth Army who are being trained, and they will do the same work as the service corps, and the area will also be expanded." What a bloody fascist secret service demon! But no matter what, it is impossible to save Chiang Kai-shek, the feudal fascist ruler, from his fate of death! Because the people will not be deceived again, and the power of the people is growing unprecedentedly!

　　法西斯的统治工具
    ——蒋记国防部“人民服务总队”的特务本质
    伍州
    蒋贼反动派头子之一的顾祝同，在去年十一月于“对人民服务总队讲词”中说：“各位的任务，就是要针对共产党以组织推进政治，以政治掩护军事的策略，实行政治‘剿匪’。”同时，在其第二总队第一大队第二中队于民国三十六年元月二十一日出版之《亲民月刊》创刊号上也写着：“人民服务队”是“推行党政工作的突击队”。它的成员，全部是在蒋贼国防部新闻局干部训练班（现共有三个分班，计有四川之綦江、隆昌及浙江之杭州）受过特务训练的；我们对其总的认识是：蒋贼国防部“人民服务总队”，是蒋贼十足的法西斯特务血腥统治的一种工具。
    于其第二总队《工作计划实施办法》中写着：“本总队以民众组训为一切工作之基本，并于民众组训中推进全盘工作。”而在顾祝同的“讲词”中，在说到“人民服务队”究竟做些什么事情时，他首先提出的第一条即是：“切实清查户口、整理保甲，务使人必归户、户必归甲；……制发国民身份证，按国民身份，分别编组各种民众团体与民众组织。”这就是说，要把一切老百姓都统治在这黑暗的血腥的保甲制度中；并像日本人在其占领区制发“良民证”一样，制发所谓“国民身份证”，而限制着一切人民的自由。在其第一大队第二中队一九四六年十二月九日至一九四七年元月三十日的一本《工作日志》上，于十二月二十日，也曾这样的写着：“汲县保甲制度不健全，致顾不到各级行政机关团体之黑暗，及奸党之潜入；故组织一个汲县青年工作总队，其队分明暗两种，明的则为及龄壮丁之组训，暗的则为一种横的秘密组织，以使其互相监督，……消灭不良分子及“奸党”。其组织分为学校、工会、商会、农会及铁路公务人员等。”——这种到处公开的限制人民自由，秘密的到处满布特务“以使其互相监督”，这就是蒋贼“人民服务总队”的所谓“组训民众”的基本内容。
    同时，在其第二中队“工作日志”的十二月十日（在新乡）及二十三日（在汲县）的两天中这样写着：“据九组报告，王家胡同五号有空军第八总站测试区台区台长杨彬似有可疑，经本人于本晚面晤其人确系区台长，态度和蔼可亲，决无有越法情事。”（十日）“华沙纺纱厂工人有八百余人，女工占全数三分之二，理事长高则仁是工会中队的中队长，此人言语刁滑……行动须待考察。”三十六年三月十三日其第二中队福字第四一七号代电中，转播着第三大队附欧阳旭及第九中队附王浩东枪杀河南陈留＠生乡新口集居民李新×（即李石塞），与搜查并拘捕左廷宾，左廷桂，左廷栋弟兄及新军联络四员李兰亭等的“嘉慰令”。于民国三十六年三月其第一大队珍秘字第六一一号代电，是为了其第二中队第四队队员舒舍予捕获了五名嫌疑犯而准予记功，并转报“传令嘉奖”。……——够了，关于蒋贼之“人民服务总队”所给予人民之法西斯恐布统治，已可由此而窥见一斑。在这样的大量“嘉慰”、“嘉奖”进行对于人民的逮捕、活埋、枪杀的情况下，谁都会想象到将会有多少无辜的百姓们被其逮捕、扣押与屠杀掉。事实上，在这样的“嘉慰”与“嘉奖”，大量捕人、杀人的情况下，而就连他们法西斯统治者自己内部的人，都被自己“无辜”的杀掉了。这在民国三十六年三月十七日其第二总队第一大队珍秘字第６３５号代电（于新乡）中称：“案奉总队长刘本年二月十四日总三字第（１１８８）号命令开：“据报第四十九旅前驻新乡陈堡镇奉调赴开封后有士兵李义海一名留驻南张门保队附郝珍璋家，于农历二月九日被该大队第二中队队员孙裕民会同保长带去，该兵称系该旅谍报，经查无证据，即被该孙裕民季韵静枪毙于奎村营等情”……等因奉此合函电仰遵照将该孙裕民季韵静二名严密扣押解送来新转解总队”（按：季韵静原系第二中队第一区队第二组组长）。——这是在他们奖励大量捕人杀人的情况下，杀到自己内部的头上，引起了内部矛盾，而孙裕民季韵静就不得不被“严密扣押解送来新”了；这也可说是孙、季的活该“倒霉”吧！但是，在蒋贼法西斯特务的血腥统治下，成千万的无辜百姓被监禁屠杀，而都还在继续着“嘉慰”、“嘉奖”呢！
    蒋贼之所谓“人民服务队”，其对于我解放区的破坏，更是阴险毒辣，无微不至；在其第二总队“协助清剿‘奸匪’实施方案草案”中的第九项，第三十八条，是这样的写着：“各队派入匪区人员，应把握客观情势，针对下列四点进行工作：（一）策动“投诚反正”，（二）煽动内哄内乱，（三）动摇军心士气，（四）搜集情报文件。”——这是如何值得引起我们警惕的呵！
    另外，在蒋军的占领区域组织“还乡团”，而随着其军事的侵占向我们的翻身农民进行“倒算”。这在顾祝同“对人民服务总队讲词”中，已说得非常透辟。他这样的说着：“最近各地都有难民还乡队的组织，我们应该领导及协助其工作。”同时又说：“共军占据期间，原有土地制度，彻底破坏，轮廓全非，以致收复之后，自不免此疆彼界，无在而不发生纠纷，各位将来实施工作时，并遵照中央颁布绥靖区施政纲领有关土地部分的规定，协助调查业权。”——这还不明白吗，自解放区逃亡到蒋占区的地主恶霸们，他们要对其进行组织和领导；而对于解放区之实行“耕者有其田”的土地改革，则认为是破坏了“原有土地制度”，而要实行“协助调查业权”，这无疑即是明确的说：要将老百姓们自地主恶霸手里斗争得到的土地，在蒋贼侵占的区域仍要强迫“归还”给地主恶霸们！这就是蒋贼之“人民服务总队”的所谓在“绥靖”区进行“调解民间纠纷”的实质。
    总之，关于蒋贼之国防部“人民服务总队”这一血腥的法西斯特务统治的工具，不管其如何的在说着是为了“解除民众痛苦”、“改善农民生活”等漂亮的词句，而在法西斯的血腥统治之下，人民是无法生活下去的；所谓抓丁、派款……这就连其法西斯的走卒们，也不得不感到有些“慌了手足”及承认“人民生活之难苦实无法形容”的情况。这在其二中队“工作日志”十二月二十九日这样的写着：“征兵问题可使我伤透了脑筋，因县政府所已中签之壮丁逃之夭夭，现已有少数壮丁系孤子抓来顶替其名额，故每日总有几个婆婆和大嫂向队部请求，请设办法，并痛哭叩头，可弄得我慌了手足”。另在其第二中队第七组组长程健于民国三十六年二月的工作周报表上写着：“物价日趋高昂，尤以日渐青黄不接之际，其物价更不知伊于胡底，……就以保安第四总队总队长扈全禄来说，……以伊之部属……薪饷完全迫民负担，浚县各保按月均忍痛出麦五大十斗，不惟浚县各保如是，与浚接壤各县亦莫不如是，以保数之多，其征集粮额亦不可胜计。”——这即是蒋贼血腥统治之下的所谓使民“安居乐业”的缩影。
    这一蒋贼封建法西斯的统治工具——国防部“人民服务总队”，目前已证实的发现它已组成有两个总队，其第一总队总队长为郭仲容（总队部现驻徐州），第二总队总队长为刘培初（总队部现驻郑州）；根据其编制，每个总队约有一千五百人，系全副武装，都是准尉以上的军官。以目前来说，这一武装的法西斯的特务组织，已是够庞大的了；但是根据蒋贼特务头子之一的的邓文仪在代表蒋贼致“人民服务总队”的信中说：“青年军正在受训的有三万多人，将要作和服务队同样的工作，而且地方也要扩大”。——好一个血腥的法西斯的特务魔王！——但是不管如何，事实上不可能挽救封建法西斯统治者蒋介石之死亡的命运！因为人民是不会再受骗了，人民的力量正空前的增涨着！
