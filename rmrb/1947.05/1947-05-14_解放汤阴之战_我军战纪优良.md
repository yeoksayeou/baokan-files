　　Liberation of Tangyin Battle
    Our Army's Excellent Discipline
    [This newspaper's North China Front, 12th dispatch] During the battle to liberate Tangyin, the battlefield discipline of a certain unit of our attacking forces was excellent. Li Jumin, a squad leader of the 4th Company of the 200th unit, lost his shoes in the mud while crossing a large trench during the battle. When he entered the city, he saw many shoes on the street, but he didn't take a single pair. He remained barefoot until the unit was transferred from city defense. Lin Zisong, a soldier of the 7th Squad, got his clothes soiled by mud when crossing the outer moat. He picked up three pieces of clothing in the city, but he said, "I cannot affect the reputation of the entire army by taking a piece of clothing." After the battle, the company checked and found that, apart from the captured guns and grenades, not a single soldier took anything. The reason for the good battlefield discipline this time was due to thorough ideological mobilization and strict organizational work before the battle. From senior commanders to soldiers, everyone could consciously abide by the rules. When a certain regiment convened a mobilization meeting for platoon leaders and above, the regimental commander spoke and guaranteed that he and the three battalion commanders and their communication soldiers would not violate discipline, proposing that "taking anything from the masses and prisoners is a disgrace." In addition, the unit, the local government, and the city defense headquarters organized a materials management committee. Non-city defense units should quickly withdraw from the city after the battle, and the enemy's military supplies that were confiscated should be distributed to the units that contributed to the capture of the city as soon as possible.

　　解放汤阴之战
    我军战纪优良
    【本报华北前线十二日电】解放汤阴战斗中，我攻城部队某部战场纪律良好。二○○部四连班长李居民，在战斗中通过大壕沟，泥水把鞋弄丢了，攻进城内见街上很多鞋子，他没拿一双，直到部队调离城防，还是光着一只脚。七班战士林子松，通过外壕衣服被泥水沾污，他在城内拾到三件衣服，他说：“我不能因拿一件衣服影响全军名誉。”该连在战斗后检查，全连除增加了缴获的枪和手榴弹外，没有一个战士拿一点东西。此次战场纪律良好原因，是由于战前有深入的思想动员和严密的组织工作，从高级指挥员到战士均能自觉遵守，某团召集排级以上动员会时，团长发言，保证他和三个营长及其通讯员决不违犯纪律，提出“拿一点群众和俘虏的东西是耻辱”。另外由部队和地方政府、城防司令部组织物资管理委员会。非城防部队在战斗结束后，应迅速撤出城外，没收敌人之军需物资，即尽先分发给攻城有功部队。
