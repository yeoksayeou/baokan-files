　　Su Village Completes Sowing Inspection and Plowing Techniques
　　[Report from Changzhi by this newspaper] Under the promotion of labor hero Bi Eryun, Su Village convened a village-wide technical committee on May 10th to inspect spring plowing and sowing techniques. The inspection results showed that: in terms of plowing and sowing, the situation was better than last year because of an increase of 51 head of livestock. Most of the autumn fields were plowed once in the autumn and once in the spring, with two harrowings. However, due to a lack of labor and the need for a concentrated effort, the phenomenon of "rough plowing and rough cultivation" was also discovered. A quarter of the village's autumn fields were sown after only one plowing. Individual households, such as Zhang Shannv and Lü Yazhe, planted 15 mu of corn directly without turning the soil. In terms of fertilizer, military dependents received fertile soil from landlords, and peasants who had been emancipated bought a considerable amount of oilseed cake with their harvest, so fertilizer was not felt to be too scarce. However, some people lacked labor and were afraid of paying wages, so they had fertilizer but didn't apply it to the fields. For example, Jin Chougou's three mu of corn received no fertilizer at all. Mao Zhagen had a latrine full of manure, but only applied less than 30 dan to his five mu of corn. Households like Zhai Yulin and Qin Qinglan sowed seeds while leaving oilseed cake aside. After the inspection, everyone realized that this would affect increased production. They immediately discussed remedial measures based on the above situation: 1. Transplant corn and other small seedlings that have been directly planted once they grow to about an inch tall, and then hoe them later. Newly sown fields can be re-plowed and re-sown. 2. Fields sown after only one plowing should be hoed one more time, with the first hoeing being slightly deeper to loosen the soil. 3. For grains and corn that have not been fertilized or have been under-fertilized, apply a top dressing once after thinning the seedlings, scattering diluted manure or oilseed cake flour around the roots of the seedlings, and then hoeing it in to turn the fertilizer into the soil. For application of coarse manure, small ditches can be dug near the roots of the seedlings, the manure scattered in, and then covered with soil. (Xing Fu, Lin Tang, Han Qing, Niu Xue)

　　苏店完成下种检查犁种技术
    【本报长治讯】二到苏店，在劳动英雄毕二云推动下，五月十号召开全村技术委员会，检查春耕下种技术。检查结果：在犁种方面，比去年好的是因增加牲口五十一头，大部秋田是秋垡一次，春犁一次，耢耙两次。但因劳力缺乏，又是突击，也发现“粗耕粗作”现象，全村犁一次就下种的占秋田四分之一，个别户如张善女、吕鸭则等没有垡茬就硬栽了十五亩玉茭。肥料方面，军属分到了地主的肥土，翻身户拿果实买到不少油饼，肥料不感太缺。但也有没劳力又怕出工资，有肥上不到地里。如靳丑狗三亩玉茭，就一点也没上肥，毛扎根有一茅房圊粪，但五亩玉茭，上肥不到三十担，翟玉林、秦庆兰等户是放着油饼播种了。经检查后，大家认识到这样会影响增产，当即根据上述情况讨论出补救办法：１、硬栽的玉茭等小苗长到寸把高，实栽一遍，以后再锄。刚下种的，可重犁重种。２、一垡地下种的要多锄一次，第一遍稍深些，把土松开。３、没上肥少上肥的谷、玉茭，在间苗后一定奶一次，把稀粪或油饼面撒到苗根，跟手就锄一遍，把粪翻到土里。上圪渣粪可在苗根挖圪道，撒进粪盖上土。（行夫、林堂、汉清、牛学）
