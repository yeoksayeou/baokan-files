In Nantianhe Village, Changzhi, 81% (weak) of livestock are collectively fed. In Xigu County, it's 91% (strong), in Xincheng Village, 62% (strong), and in Zhonghe Village, it's over 90%. Combining these four villages, out of 140 livestock, 115 are collectively bought and fed, accounting for more than 82%. However, there are some existing problems with collective livestock feeding and use. For example, in Caiyuan Group of Nantianhe, no one wants to feed the livestock, leading to broken reins and no one to replace them, and thin donkeys with no one to care for them. The donkey seems to have no owner. Collecting feed every three days is considered troublesome by everyone. Jin Tang's wife wanted to go to a fair while someone was plowing, and when she wasn't allowed, they argued. In Xinglong Group, they collectively bought an ox. Plowing fields and hauling coal are paid wages, but grinding grain isn't. Qi Hao's wife used the livestock to grind grain, and Huai Suo's wife also wanted to grind, saying, "There's a share for you, and there's a share for me." So they argued. In Xigu County Village, people who collectively feed livestock all think they own the livestock, and they compete to use them, causing disunity within the mutual aid team. There are three reasons for these problems: First, the issue of voluntariness. When distributing the harvest, livestock are often distributed to the collective involuntarily, leading to more problems. Some were initially voluntary when collectively bought, but later became unwilling due to issues such as equivalent value and work points, leading to wanting to leave the group. However, they are held back by their livestock shares, causing frustration. This lack of freedom to leave the group also hinders the principle of voluntariness. Second, the issue of equivalent value. Third, the issue of work points, such as finding feeding troublesome but wanting to be the first to use the livestock, and disputes arising from temporary lack of arrangements. Therefore, in places with these problems, quickly allowing the masses to establish reasonable systems should become one of the issues to be addressed in reorganizing and consolidating mutual aid teams.

The Nantianhe Village mutual aid team leaders' meeting discussed the issue of livestock feeding and decided on the following measures: (1) The feeding family is responsible for feeding the livestock, plowing, and official duties (expenses reimbursed by the team). The feeding family gets the manure and may not have to contribute to feed or contribute less. (2) Feed is collected every half month or month, and fixed personnel take turns carrying water and chopping grass, all counted as work points. Plowing, delivering manure, and hauling coal earn wages, and grinding grain and other odd jobs also count as wages. Profits are distributed according to shares when settling accounts. (3) Livestock will be displayed at the village's "Bibi Fair" on the tenth day of the fourth lunar month, and their quality will be evaluated, with those who have fed their livestock well receiving awards. Cao Yingqiu, the best feeding family at the meeting, said, "Up before dawn, to feed livestock well, you have to be diligent. The grass must be short, the feed must be crushed, feed and water frequently, and they will gain weight. A small knot is worth a bean, never stop adding bran." This excited Wang Siyou, an old man in his sixties, who laughed loudly and said, "I'll compete with you." Since then, a competition has been launched in collective livestock feeding. Xigu County Village also held a meeting on collective livestock feeding. In addition to measures similar to those in Nantianhe, those who find the number of shares too large can exchange them for equivalent value, appropriately dispersing the number of collective households and increasing the number of small collective livestock feeding within the group.

There are several types of collective livestock feeding methods in Xincheng Village: (1) Livestock are fed and used by small-scale cooperative flour mills. The livestock eat at the flour mill, and plowing fields, hauling coal, and occasional use all earn wages. The money earned is distributed according to shares. (2) A dedicated person is selected to feed and use the livestock, and the feeding family gets the manure. (3) Hiring someone to feed and use the livestock. The cost of livestock feed and the worker's wages are shared according to shares, with meals provided in rotation (every five days, ten days, or a month). (4) Whoever uses the livestock feeds it. In Nanhe Village, there is also a method called contracting, where the team relies on one person to feed and use the livestock. Each household in the team contributes four liters of feed for plowing fields, delivering manure, and hauling coal, and the feeding family is responsible for the livestock's transportation earnings and official expenses. Among the above methods, the first two are more common and better. One of the basic experiences here is to select a dedicated person to feed the livestock. It is best to have a dedicated person responsible for feeding and using the livestock, so that more attentive care can be given to the livestock.

　　关于伙喂牲口问题
    长治南天河村伙喂的牲口占百分之八十一（弱），西故县占百分之九十一（强），辛呈村占百分之六十二（强），中和村占百分之九十以上，四村合计起来，一百四十头牲口当中，伙买伙喂的共一百一十五头，占百分之八十二还多。可是在伙喂伙用牲口上，目前存在着的一些问题，如南天河才元组，是谁都不想喂牲口，弄的缰断了没人接，驴瘦了没人管。驴好像没主儿一样，三天一集料，人人嫌麻烦，正在犁地，金堂娘想去赶会，不允许，就吵起来。兴隆组伙买一头牛，犁地拉煤出工资，推碾不出工资，起好娘用牲口推碾，怀锁娘也要碾，她说：“有你的份，也有我的份。”于是就吵起来。西故县村，伙喂牲口的人们都以为自己有了牲口，等着用和抢着用，造成了互助组内的不团结。这些问题的产生有三个原因：第一，是自愿问题，分果实时伙分牲口，多是不自愿，问题也多。有的虽是伙买，当时是自愿的，但后来由于等价、做活等问题而又不愿意了，以至想跳组，但又因牲口股拖住跳不出去而苦闷。这种出组不自由也妨碍了自愿原则。第二，是等价问题。第三，是做活问题，如喂时嫌麻烦，用时想争先，一时欠安排，就会嚷起来。因之有这些问题的地方，应迅速让群众自己建立合理制度，就成为整理与巩固互助组应注意的问题之一。
    南天河村互助组长会议讨论喂牲口问题，决定如下办法：（一）喂牲口掌犁及支差（盘费归组）都由喂家负责，喂家得粪，并可以不摊料或少摊料。（二）每半月或一个月集一次料、固定人轮流担水，铡草，破料等都算分。犁地、送粪、拉煤赚工资，推碾磨等零活也算工资，结账时按股分红。（三）在阴历四月初十村的“比比会”上展览牲口，评议好坏，喂好牲口的受奖。会上顶好的喂家曹迎秋说：“三更不睡五更起，想喂好牲口，非手勤不行。草要短料要碎，勤些上勤些喂，水草均匀就上膘。一个圪节顶一颗豆，吃不尽上把麸。”这一下激动了六十多岁的王四有老汉，大声笑道，“我和你赛”。从此在伙喂牲口上便掀起了竞赛。西故县村，也开了伙喂牲口的会议，办法除和南天河相类似外，嫌股份太多者，可以等价折换，适当分散合伙户数，增加组内的小伙买喂牲口。
    在伙喂牲口办法上，辛呈村存在着几种类型：（一）牲口由小型合作粉坊喂使，牲口吃在粉坊，犁地、拉煤及零星使用一律赚工资，赚下的钱按股分红。（二）推选专人喂养和使用，喂家得粪。（三）雇人喂使，牲口草料和雇工，工资都按股摊，轮流管饭（五天，十天，一个月）。（四）谁使谁喂。在南和村还有一种叫作包干的办法，即组里专靠一人喂用，组内各户犁地，送粪，拉煤统一出四升料，其余牲口运输赚钱和支差，开支的归喂家。以上办法中前两种较普遍也较好，这里的基本经验之一，是选专人喂，喂和使最好有专人负责，这样对牲口的照顾上，就会更周到。
