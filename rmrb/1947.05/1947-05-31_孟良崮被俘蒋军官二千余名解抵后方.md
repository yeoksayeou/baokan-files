Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 28th—The first group of two thousand captured Chiang Kai-shek officers from the Menglianggu battle have safely arrived at a certain location in the Liberated Area rear. This group includes Lieutenant Colonel Zhou Yaqiu, Deputy Commander of the 152nd Regiment of the 51st Brigade of the 74th Division, Lieutenant Colonel Qin Minghui, Deputy Commander of the 172nd Regiment of the 58th Brigade, Lieutenant Colonel Wang [missing character], Battalion Commander of the Independent Battalion directly under the Division, and Major Li Buyun, Battalion Commander of the Engineer Battalion of the 58th Brigade, and other mid- and low-ranking officers. Their clothes were tattered. Before being captured, they had been starving on the barren hills of Menglianggu for two days and nights, their faces were haggard and exhausted, and their eyes were dull. The People's Liberation Army continues to treat them favorably, based on its lenient policy.
    Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 28th—Chiang Kai-shek's 74th Division officers and soldiers who laid down their weapons in the Menglianggu campaign freely talked about the demise of their army. Zhang Lixin, a gunner from the artillery battalion of the 51st Brigade, said: "Your (referring to the People's Liberation Army) artillerymen are number one, no shot misses. When we (referring to the Chiang army), a group of two hundred people and thirty mules were going down the mountain, there were only a few left." Cui Chuandian, a soldier directly under the 57th Brigade, said: "Our troops were completely disrupted by you. Running east then slipping west, running west then slipping east. Zhang Baizi (referring to Division Commander Zhang Lingfu) was also running around, no longer in charge (meaning unable to command). The soldiers hadn't eaten or drunk for two days and nights, they were exhausted, threw their guns aside, and lay down saying: 'Screw it, surrender, I'm not fighting anymore.'" Dong Zhongxiang, the head nurse of the health team of the 151st Regiment of the 51st Brigade, said: "In the end, our troops were so chaotic that we couldn't control them. The brigade commander (referring to Chen Chuanjun, the brigade commander of the 51st Brigade) was so anxious that he threw his binoculars on the ground, tore up the map, and sighed repeatedly: 'I'm going to die here this time.' Later, he just squeezed around with everyone else." Han Youzhi, a machine gunner from the 170th Regiment of the 57th Brigade, angrily scolded the officers for still bragging about the "74th Division never having lost a battle," this time it was a "complete failure."

　　孟良崮被俘蒋军官二千余名解抵后方
    【新华社华东前线廿八日电】孟良崮战斗中就俘之蒋军七十四师五十一旅一五二团中校副团长周亚球，五十八旅一七二团中校副团长秦名徽，师直独立营中校营长王＠、五十八旅工兵营少校营长李步云等中下级官佐首批二千人已于日前安抵解放区后方某地。他们衣服褴褛。就俘前在孟良崮荒山上挨饿两昼夜，面色憔悴困顿，双目黯然无光。解放军仍本宽大政策，予以优待。
    【新华社华东前线廿八日电】孟良崮战役中放下武器之蒋军七十四师官兵畅谈该军覆灭情景。五十一旅炮兵营炮手张立新说：“你们（指人民解放军）的炮手要算第一，没有那一炮不打中的。我们（指蒋军）一堆二百多人，三十匹骡马下山时已没有几个了。”五十七旅旅直士兵崔传典说：“我们队伍全给你们打乱了，东边跑来向西溜，西边跑来向东溜。张跛子（指师长张灵甫）也跑来跑去，不当家了。（无法指挥的意思）当兵的两天两夜没吃没喝没劲儿，把枪往身旁一扔，都躺下来说：‘操他妈的，缴枪就缴枪，投降就投降，老子不打了。’”五十一旅一五一团卫生队看护长董忠祥说：“最后我们的队伍乱得没办法掌握了，旅长（指五十一旅旅长陈传钧）急得把望远镜往地下一扔，把地图也撕了，连声叹气说：‘这下子我可死在这里了。’后来他也就随着大家挤来挤去。”五十七旅一七○团机枪手韩友之怒骂当官的还吹什么“七十四师没打过败仗”的牛皮，这一回可算是“完全失败了”。
