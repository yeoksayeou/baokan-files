　　Mass Campaign for Merit Spurs a Surge
  　Zuoquan Completes Sowing in Twenty Days
    [Report from this newspaper in Zuoquan] The sowing work in Zuoquan has been completed in twenty days of intense effort. During this crash program, the mass campaign for merit played a significant role in guaranteeing the successful completion of the task. A county-wide competition was launched among individuals, groups, villages, district cadres and village cadres, military families and revolutionary soldiers, women and children. Countless new activists and heroic models emerged during the campaign. In ten villages of the Third District Joint Defense, statistics show that the mass summary selected 274 heroic and capable individuals. The merit conditions for cadres and heroic masses universally implemented ideological leadership, democratic style, and practical actions to lead others, and to ensure good care for military dependents and their farming. For example, cadres in the Seventh District personally participated in labor to carry manure, and the head of the Fenghou mutual aid group encouraged four lazy people to reform by addressing their concerns. The hero Zhao Shuanhai influenced others to become prosperous by hiring laborers and buying land himself. Furthermore, priority was universally given to sowing for the militia, followed by completing the farming for military dependents.
    However, from the beginning of the mobilization to the victorious completion, various difficulties were overcome. After the general mobilization for production in various villages, they received combat missions. This time, the county adopted a voluntary sign-up for participation. The militia's armed consciousness and eagerness to participate inspired the masses to consciously help with farming. However, after sowing the land for the participating militia, the masses felt it was still too early, and the seasonal thinking of step-by-step progression remained. There was insufficient awareness of the long-term nature of the war and the lack of labor. Based on the masses' thinking, district cadres first started by discussing current affairs to recognize the long-term nature of the war and establish a long-term concept of war participation among the masses. Next, they addressed the seasonal thinking. For example, the masses in villages like Houzhuang used practical experience to propose the slogan "Better to take advantage of suitable soil than to follow the season." Zhang Mucheng accepted the lessons from the 1943 famine and said, "Early planting in Zhanghuang leads to rice in the autumn; Zhang Qiucheng planted according to the season but nothing matured." Some villages proposed the slogan "Not afraid of too much labor, only afraid of not being able to use it." The masses clearly understood that having labor did not necessarily mean it could be used when needed, and from then on, they started delivering manure. At the beginning of the action, everyone felt that there were too few livestock and a lack of labor, but they thought that the auxiliary labor of women and children was useless. At this time, the district cadres used precise calculation methods to further make the masses concretely understand the degree of labor shortage, and also discussed how to complete sowing ahead of schedule, so that the masses recognized the importance of organizing auxiliary labor. They proposed the slogan "A good hand cannot keep up with many people." They made it so that everyone was producing, and no one, big or small, was idle. In addition, in the twenty-day production campaign, they exerted the spirit of diligent planning, diligent inspection, and diligent summary, so that the work was successfully completed. This approach is entirely in line with a basic method of production mutual aid that saves labor and benefits both parties, and it is also an approach that farmers love. For example, in Fenghou, Changjieyan and other villages, the first stage of the plan was to complete fifteen circles of sheep manure in five days, with eighteen full laborers and eleven half laborers participating. As a result, it was completed in four days, saving thirty laborers. Everyone felt that the task was clear, and it was easy to do.

### 群众性立功运动掀起热潮　左权二十天完成播种

　　群众性立功运动掀起热潮
  　左权二十天完成播种
    【本报左权讯】左权播种工作，经二十天的紧张突击，已全部完成。在突击过程中，群众性的立功运动，给胜利完成任务起了重大保证作用。全县掀起人与人，组与组，村与村，区干部与村干部，军属与荣军，妇女与儿童的相互竞赛。运动中涌现出无数新的积极分子与英雄模范。三区中联防十个村统计，群众性总结选出英雄能手二百七十四名，在干部、英雄群众的立功条件中，普遍贯彻了思想领导、民主作风与实际行动带领别人，保证优军代耕做好等项。如七区干部亲自参加劳动担粪，丰堠互助组长以摸心事鼓励方式改造了四个懒汉。英雄赵拴孩自己用雇工、买地，影响别人发家。并普遍给民兵先下种，接着完成军属代耕。
    但从动员开始到胜利完成，曾克服种种困难。各村生产大动员后，接到参战任务，这次参战，全县是采取自愿报名的。由于民兵的武装自觉争先参战，也启发了群众的自觉助耕。但种完参战民兵土地后群众觉得还太早，按步就班的季节思想仍然存在，对参战长期性与劳力缺乏的认识还不足。区干部根据群众思想，首先从讨论时事，以认清参战的长期性，树立群众长期参战观念。接着解决季节思想，如后庄等村群众以实际经验，提出“按季节不如趁垧土”的口号。张木成接受四三年灾荒教训说：“张黄小早种，秋天有米吃，张秋成按季节没成熟。”有的村提出“不怕劳力多，光怕用不上”的口号。群众清楚了有劳力不一定到时能用，从此开始送粪。在行动一开始，大家就感到牲口少、劳力缺乏，但对妇女儿童辅助劳力认为不顶事。这时区干部以精确计算办法，进一步使群众具体了解劳力缺乏程度，又讨论如何提前完成下种，使群众认识组织辅助劳力的重要。提出“好手赶不上人多”的口号。作到了人人都生产，大小没闲人。此外在二十天的生产运动中，发挥了勤计划、勤检查、勤总结的精神，使工作顺利完成。这种作法，是完全合乎生产互助省工互利的一个基本办法，也是农民所喜爱的作法。如丰堠、长节岩等村，第一段计划五天担完十五圈羊粪，参加全劳力十八个，半劳力十一个，结果四天完成，省工三十个，大家感到任务明确，做起来又轻快。
