Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 12th. A reporter from the Northern Jiangsu Branch commented: The war situation behind Chiang's lines in Northern Jiangsu in April has undergone significant changes. Chiang's army is unable to conduct large-scale "encirclement and suppression" operations against the vast People's Liberation Army, and is also unable to control transportation lines. The People's Liberation Army and militia guerrillas counterattacked everywhere. There were 998 battles throughout the month, eliminating 3,252 enemies, seizing 14 small cannons, 4 grenade launchers, 46 various machine guns, 1,028 rifles, and nearly 60,000 rounds of ammunition. Taking the Yancheng-Funing District as an example, the number of enemies eliminated was twice as many as last month, and the number of captures was more than doubled. In the first half of March alone, Chiang's army in Huai'an was still conducting "encirclement and suppression" operations in the eastern suburbs of the city. In April, there was no "encirclement and suppression" in Yancheng-Funing for the entire month. The People's Liberation Army and militia guerrillas launched powerful counterattacks on both sides of the Grand Canal and along various transportation lines. The five major highways in Northern Jiangsu – Tongyu, Huaimu, Huailian, Lianxin (South Xin'an Town), and Lianyi (Dayi) – were all cut off at one point. The Tongyu Highway, which runs through Northern Jiangsu, was paralyzed in the midst of widespread guerrilla warfare, and it was difficult to pass north of Funing. The reporter continued to review the situation in Northern Jiangsu in February and March, stating: At that time, Chiang's army divided Northern Jiangsu into three major blocks, attempting to gradually "encircle and suppress" the areas. However, a large number of Chiang's troops in Shandong were annihilated, and the 25th Division of Chiang's army, originally stationed in Huai'an, was hurriedly transferred north. The 21st Division of Chiang's army, stationed along the Yeting-Funing line, was also transferred to Taiwan, and the replacements were only two regiments of the Reorganized 4th Division and the remnants of the defeated troops of Hao Pengju, who had lost their combat effectiveness. In the Xiaocunji battle, the People's Liberation Army of Northern Jiangsu directly pressed on the city of Lianshui. The annihilation battle at Huji shook Muyang. As a result, Chiang's army was on the defensive everywhere, and the People's Liberation Army was on the offensive everywhere. The two major areas of Yancheng-Funing and Huaihai have been linked together.

　　苏北敌后战局有显著变化
    蒋军无力控制交通线
    【新华社华中十二日电】苏北分社记者评称：四月份苏北蒋后战局有显著转变。蒋军无力对广大解放军作大规模“清剿”，交通线亦无力控制。人民解放军及民兵游击队到处反击。全月作战九九八次，歼敌三二五二名，缴小炮十四门，掷弹筒四个，各种机枪四十六挺，步枪一○二八支，子弹近六万发。以盐阜区论，歼敌数较上月多二倍，缴获多一倍。仅三月上半月淮安蒋军尚在城东郊进行“清剿”，四月份盐阜全月无“清剿”。人民解放军与民兵游击队则在运河两岸及各交通线展开强大反击。苏北五大公路通榆、淮沐、淮涟、涟新（南新安镇）、涟伊（大伊）均曾被一度切断，贯穿苏北之通榆公路，在漫天游击战火中，陷入麻痹状态，阜宁以北已难通行。记者继回述二、三月间苏北形势称：那时蒋军将苏北分割为三大块，企图分区逐步“清剿”，但山东蒋军大量被歼，原驻两淮之蒋军二十五师匆匆北调，驻叶挺、阜宁一线蒋二十一师亦调台湾，接防者仅为整四师二个团及失却战斗力之郝逆鹏举残部。苏北人民解放军小村集一战，直迫涟水城下。胡集歼灭战，沐阳为之震动。遂使蒋军处处防御，解放军处处主动，盐阜淮海两大地区已联成一片。
