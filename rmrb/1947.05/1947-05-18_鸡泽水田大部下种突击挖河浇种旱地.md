Jize is combining river dredging with land review work. All the county's land has been plowed, and most of the paddy fields have been planted. Currently, the masses in various villages are rushing to dig rivers to draw water for irrigating dry land. In the Dongxiaoqu Guanzhuang area of the ninth district, seven villagers plan to dig five more small river branches so that the high-lying areas of the seven villages can be irrigated at any time. The county government is leading the dredging of the Niuwei River, with seventy-one villages participating, all vying to become river-digging models. Women from various villages are also volunteering to participate. The river project was originally planned to be completed in six days, but villages such as Wuguanying and Chengxijie completed it in four and a half to five days. During the river management, it was combined with a review; while digging the river, they were also brewing up action. Seven villages in Chengguan conducted a collective accusation meeting at the river, and the masses' emotions were tragic and impassioned. After completing the river work, they immediately carried out struggles in the villages in the evenings and mornings. Wuguanying, Huanggu, and Xiaozhai fired the first shots, and villages in the fourth district and Chengguan also fired one after another. In early April, more than twenty villages in the fourth district conducted liquidations against landlords who had been overlooked or not thoroughly struggled against, and the masses recovered a large amount of property. For example, Xizhendi struggled against Du Lao Ji for 740 silver dollars; Yang Caozhuang struggled against Zhang Runtao for 280 pieces of silk cloth and foreign cloth; a certain village held family accusation meetings and collective accusation meetings on the river in the struggle against nine landlord households. Villages that have completed the review are now engaged in production during the day and distributing the fruits of the struggle in the evening. The war support work in the villages has not been delayed at all. They have organized young and strong laborers to dig rivers and have organized the elderly, women, and children to grind military flour and hull military rice. For example, in Wuguanying, in addition to the old hero Ye Wenzhang leading the young and strong to dig rivers, women's leader Lian Zi Niang led twelve women to volunteer to dig rivers, and the women and children left behind ground 3,500 kilograms of military flour in three days. Because the young and strong men rushed to dig the river, they completed the task two days ahead of schedule and received a reward of more than 6,000 yuan.

    【本报冀南十六日电】鸡泽挖河复查战勤结合进行，全县土地全部犁完，大部水田业已下种。现各村群众正突击挖河，以便引水浇种旱地。九区东小区贯庄一带七个群众，计划再挖五个小河岔，使七村的高凹地均能随时灌溉。县府领导浚治牛尾河，七十一村参加，竞相争取挖河模范。各村妇女亦自报奋勇参加，挖河工程原计划六天完成，吴官营、城西街等村四天半至五天即告完成。治河时结合复查，一面挖河，一面酝酿，城关七个村在河上进行了集体大诉苦，群众情绪悲壮激昂，挖完河工后，晚上、早晨即在村里进行斗争。吴官营、黄沟、小寨打响第一炮，四区各村及城关各村亦纷纷打响。四月上旬，四区二十多村均对疏漏的和未斗透的地主，进行了清算，群众收回了大批财物。如西臻底斗出杜老际银洋七百四十元；杨曹庄斗出张润涛绸缎洋布等二百八十件；×村在斗争九户地主中，先后召开了家庭诉苦会及河上集体诉苦大会。复查结束村庄，刻正白天生产，晚上分配果实。各村战勤工作亦毫未耽误，他们把青壮全劳力组织起来挖河，把老头、妇女、小孩组织起来，磨军面碾军米。如吴官营除老英雄叶文章领导青壮挖河，妇女领袖莲子娘领导十二个妇女报奋勇挖河外，留下的妇女儿童三天即磨军面三千五百斤。由于青壮年，突击挖河，提前两天完成任务，获得六千余元的奖励。
