　　Chiang Kai-shek Area Economic Chaos
    Rice-Snatching Wave Rises Repeatedly
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th: Rice-snatching waves have successively broken out in Wuhu (Wuhu is a well-known rice-producing area in the country), Yichang, Jiangshan and other places, and the situation is serious. The Shanghai Xinmin Daily criticized this extraordinary situation, saying: "Stopping the civil war is the only effective way to solve the economic problem."
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th: Shanghai report: While the Chiang government is singing loudly about issuing bonds to recover Chiang currency, a large batch of Chiang currency printed by the Chiang government in foreign countries is pouring into Shanghai. Following the 390 boxes of new banknotes shipped from the United States on April 1, another 472 boxes of new banknotes printed by the British printing factory were shipped to Shanghai on April 11. It is reported that the new banknotes are all large denominations and are continuously being shipped in transit, the number of which is extremely considerable. It is generally estimated that prices in the Chiang area will continue to rise sharply as a result. According to the new official statistics released by the Chiang Kai-shek Finance Department's Public Debt Department, the Chiang government has issued 42 kinds of bonds in the past that have not been fully repaid, which, together with the current US dollar bonds and treasury bills, total 44 kinds.

　　蒋区经济混乱
    抢米风潮迭起
    【新华社陕北九日电】抢米风潮又于芜湖（按芜湖为全国著名之产米区）、宜昌、江山等地相继爆发，形势严重。沪新民报批评此种非常形势称：“停止内战，是解决经济问题的唯一有效办法”。
    【新华社陕北九日电】沪报讯：在蒋政府高唱发行债券以求蒋币回笼之际，蒋政府在外国承印之大批蒋币又源源到沪。继四月一日美国运来之三百九十箱新钞后，四月十一日复由英国印钞厂制印新钞四百七十二箱运沪。据悉新钞均系大钞，且陆续在途装运，为数极其可观。一般估计，蒋区物价显将随之继续猛涨。又据蒋记财政部公债司新发表之正式统计，蒋政府过去发放而尚未偿付完竣之各种债券，计四十二种，连同此次之美金公债库券共达四十四种。
