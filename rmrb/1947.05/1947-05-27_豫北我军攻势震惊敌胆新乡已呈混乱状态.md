　　[Special dispatch from this newspaper] After our army captured Tangyin and captured the traitor Sun Dianying alive, the enemy in Xinxiang was extremely panicked and took strict precautions. Anyone entering or leaving the city gates must hold a special pass issued by the military authorities and undergo a strict body search, even women were not exempt. Pedestrians were cut off in the evening. Since the 13th of this month, all men in the county between the ages of 15 and 55, regardless of whether they were scholars, farmers, workers, or merchants, have been forced to dig fortifications around the city gates. Those who evade or escape will have their household registration canceled and be subject to heavy fines. Men passing through the streets of the urban area were immediately arrested. Ordinary citizens, workers, and vendors were all complaining about this. In order to collect bricks, tiles, and wood, all the temples in various places have been completely demolished. The famous Guo Tian Temple, tombs, and ancestral steles in Beihuayuan Village have also been demolished, and many civilian houses have also been demolished. Fierce runners and soldiers went to various villages every day to urge work and demand materials. If there was any delay, they were whipped. Even the Chiang Kai-shek puppet Baos and Jia chiefs fled one after another because they could not cope. The livestock and vehicles of ordinary farmers were driven out during the day and hidden in remote places to avoid being taken away. Many people fled to the liberated areas. The order in the four rural areas has become chaotic, and the people everywhere are looking forward to our army rescuing them from the abyss of suffering. (Xi Zhang)
　　[Dispatch from this newspaper, Jilu Yu, 25th] On April 28th, our 7th Military Sub-district guerrillas seized a letter from Yuan Chunting, the Chiang Kai-shek puppet County Chief of Yuncheng, on the Yunji Highway, which fully reflected the terror and fear of the Chiang Kai-shek puppet personnel towards our guerrilla warfare. The letter stated: "Taking the road from Jining to Yuncheng via Wenshang, I was escorted by Commander Xu's troops. The car refused to go west upon reaching Wenshang because they were afraid of the guerrillas. The subordinate and Li Yongqin, the County Chief of Shou Zhang (Chiang Kai-shek regime), are waiting for an opportunity to advance. On the 16th, two platoons of the military supply unit of the 37th Regiment of the New 17th Brigade of the 71st Division arrived in Wenshang and stopped advancing westward (note: again, they were afraid of the guerrillas). I had no choice but to ask Commander Zhao, who was stationed there, to send troops to escort them. I also took the opportunity to travel with them and arrived at the east gate of Yuncheng at 4:00 pm on April 18th. The highway from Heze to Yuncheng is impassable, and most of the military transport vehicles are dilapidated. The troops stationed there rely entirely on local supplies for supplies, and the people's strength is exhausted. At this time of famine in spring, I really feel unsustainable. I am light in talent and bear a heavy responsibility, and I am deeply worried that I will not be able to win. I implore Your Honor to dismiss me as soon as possible. At present, there are many obstacles to local politics, and there are many difficulties, insufficient manpower, and even more financial resources. The general "cadres" have deeply ingrained habits (eating, drinking, whoring, gambling, and embezzlement), which are extremely difficult to correct. The local forces and factional concepts are complex, and there are contradictions everywhere. The forces cancel each other out, which in turn makes the work sluggish and develops inertia. I feel cold when I think of this."
　　[Dispatch from this newspaper, Jilu Yu, 25th] According to people from Jinan: After the news of the capture of Li Xianzhou and others and the successive annihilation of Wang Jingjiu's troops in the Laiwu and Tai'an battles reached Jinan City, the Chiang Kai-shek puppet army was extremely panicked and saw ghosts at the slightest sign of trouble. They conducted household registration checks several times a day and forcibly collected food from merchants, making it impossible for merchants to do business. They all eagerly hoped that the Eighth Route Army would enter the city to rescue them.

　　豫北我军攻势震惊敌胆新乡已呈混乱状态
    【本报特讯】我大军攻克汤阴，生俘孙逆殿英后，新乡敌人恐慌异常，严加戒备，进出城关必须持有军事机关发出之特别通行证，并须经受严格之周身检查，即女子亦不能免。傍晚即断绝行人。自本月十三日起，全县十五岁至五十五岁之所有男子，不论士农工商，一律被迫至城关周围挖掘工事，如有规避逃脱，除取消其户口外，并处以苛重之罚金。市区各街道如遇男子通过，即行抓去。一般市民、工人及商贩对此莫不叫苦连天。为搜罗砖瓦木料，各处之庙宇已被拆除净尽。北花园村著名之郭天宫、坟茔、祖先碑楼，亦被拆去，民房亦有不少被拆。凶恶之衙吏士兵，每日至各村催工索料，稍一迟缓，鞭笞即至。虽蒋记各保甲长，亦因无法应付，相率逃跑。一般农民之牲口车辆，均于白昼赶出，隐避于荒僻之所，以免拉去。许多民众纷纷逃入解放区。四乡秩序已呈混乱状态，各处民众莫不盼望我军早日拯救其出于水深火热之中。（锡璋）
    【本报冀鲁豫二十五日电】四月二十八日，我七分区游击队在郓济公路上，缴获蒋记郓城县长袁春霆一封信，充分反映了蒋伪人员对我游击战争之恐怖畏惧，内称：“由济宁取道汶上赴郓城，蒙徐总队长派兵护送，汽车至汶上坚不西开，怕游击队，职与寿张（蒋记政权）李县长永勤候机待进。十六日，七一师新十七旅三七团军需部队两个排，抵汶后又停留不再西进（按：又是怕游击队），不得已乃请驻军赵团长派兵护送。职亦趁机同行，于四月十八日午后四时到达郓城东关。荷泽至郓城公路不通，军方运输汽车多破旧不堪，驻军给养全需地方供给，民力已竭，际此荒春，实感不支。职才轻任重，值兹时艰，深虞弗胜。恳钧座早予罢免，目前地方政治障碍重重，困难殊多，人力不足，财力尤甚。一般“工作干部”积习甚深（吃喝嫖赌贪赃枉法），极难纠正，地方势力及派系观念复杂，处处矛盾，力量对消，反而工作消沉，惰性发展，言念及此，深感寒心。”
    【本报冀鲁豫二十五日电】据济南来人谈：莱芜、泰安战役中，李仙洲等被俘，王敬久部相继被歼的消息传至济市后，蒋伪军异常恐慌，闻风见鬼，草木皆兵。一天清查户口数次，强行征收商家粮食，闹得商家无法营生。彼等无不殷盼八路军进城营救他们。
