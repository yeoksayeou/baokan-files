　　The Border Region Government and Military Region Call for Emergency Mobilization Throughout the Region
    To Launch a Struggle to Protect Men and Grain
    Northern Henan Counties Organize Joint Summer Harvest Defense to Strike at Chiang Kai-shek's and Puppet Troops' Grain Seizures
    [Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] Since the Patriotic Self-Defense War, after the People's Liberation Army eliminated over seventy brigades of Chiang Kai-shek, Yan Xishan, and puppet troops, the replenishment of enemy forces has become increasingly depleted. Especially after our army's proactive offensives, Chiang Kai-shek, Yan Xishan, and puppet troops have been largely compressed into a few points and lines. The vast rural areas have been recovered or liberated by us. Enemy troops and grain supplies are showing signs of being unsustainable. Therefore, they are frantically grabbing men and seizing grain from our liberated areas to save their crisis and make a dying struggle. Some areas in our border region have suffered some losses because of insufficient attention. In response to the enemy's conspiracy to seize men and grain, the Border Region Government and Military Region specifically call on all Party, government, military, and civilians in our region to mobilize urgently to launch a struggle against Chiang Kai-shek, Yan Xishan, and puppet troops to cut off the enemy's bloody hands. Special calls are made as follows: 1. All young and middle-aged men in border areas, guerrilla areas, and combat areas should voluntarily participate in our self-defense forces and militia organizations, arm themselves, and carry out guerrilla warfare to protect their own lives and property. 2. All young and middle-aged men in border areas, guerrilla areas, and combat areas, when the enemy is temporarily strong and irresistible, can temporarily seek refuge with our army, serve in logistical support work, and receive food, vegetables, and wages from us. They can freely return home when the war situation eases, and will never be forced to stay. All our regular army, local corps, and guerrillas have the sacred obligation to protect able-bodied men, protect harvesting, and extract forces as much as possible to participate in harvesting. 3. All border areas, guerrilla areas, and combat areas should implement the combination of labor and military affairs during the summer and autumn harvests, with the rear supporting the front and conducting surprise harvesting. Hold guns to protect the fields and defend our grain. 4. The wheat harvest and autumn harvest should be carried out quickly, threshed quickly, dried quickly, and stored quickly, so that the enemy cannot seize a single grain. When necessary, some border areas can rely on relatives and transfer grain to our inland areas for storage. 5. All public grain allocated in border areas and guerrilla areas should be quickly stored and transported. Except for a small portion retained to support local guerrilla warfare, the majority must be transported back to the inland areas for decentralized storage. 6. All public and private stores and cooperatives should control the grain trade in border areas and guerrilla areas as much as possible to prevent it from falling into enemy hands. 7. When the enemy is seizing grain and grabbing men, our armed work teams and local guerrillas must concentrate their forces to strike at and eliminate the enemy's looting teams and conscription teams, and should implement village-to-village joint defense, widely carry out guerrilla warfare and landmine warfare to blockade and monitor the enemy. All our regular army and local corps must provide powerful cooperation nearby. 8. Every summer and autumn harvest, it is necessary to organize a unified force of Party, government, military, and civilians to launch political offensives against the enemy, disrupt the enemy's local government system, and eliminate the enemy's henchmen, so that the enemy loses its foundation for seizing grain and grabbing men. 9. When the enemy concentrates a certain force to launch a sudden attack on us, we should transfer grain in a timely manner, store it in a decentralized manner, and not allow a single grain to aid the enemy.

    [Dispatch from this Newspaper] Wheat is ripe in the Fourth Sub-district of Taihang, and the summer harvest is approaching. The masses in the guerrilla areas and areas bordering the enemy are eager to regain the land and wheat fields illegally occupied by Chiang Kai-shek's diehards, and hope for armed cover for harvesting wheat. Our sub-district armed forces, local armed forces, militia, and armed work teams are widely carrying out the movement to protect the fields and wheat. The Prefectural Committee, the Political Department of the Sub-district, the Prefectural Commissioner's Office, the Industrial and Commercial Bank, and the Cooperative General Society and other organs specifically organized an armed emancipation team of more than 30 people, led by Deputy Commissioner Liu Mei, to set off for the guerrilla area south of the road, to mobilize the masses, carry out the anti-liquidation of accounts and protect the fields and wheat movement, and regain the land and wheat fields to re-distribute to the masses. The Fourth Prefectural Commissioner's Office, in addition to retaining a small number of cadres to persist in the work of the organs, mostly participated in the emancipation team. And determined: 1. Order the county and district governments to persist in the guerrilla warfare of dividing fields and wheat, the district does not leave the district, and the county does not leave the county. 2. Explicitly and resolutely suppress the leaders of the liquidation of accounts, special agents, and gunmen. 3. All troops, militia, armed work teams, and cadres at all levels who have contributed to the movement to divide fields and wheat, protect fields and wheat will be commended and rewarded.

    [Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu, 23rd] In the Taiyue border area, 100,000 emancipated peasants in Ji(yuan) and Meng(xian) counties, under the slogan of "one hand holding a gun, one hand holding a sickle, fighting on one side, and harvesting on the other," formed armed grain seizing teams to prepare for the wheat harvest. Joint harvest defense is organized between districts and villages. In the area of hundreds of miles from the border of Qin(yang) and Meng(xian) in the east to the bank of the Yellow River in the south, a solid joint defense fortress has been woven horizontally and vertically. Many mobile armed forces and flying explosion groups in Jiyuan have set out to the front line to cooperate with the militia of Mengxian to encircle the enemy in Nanling. And laid out a dense minefield along the Manghe River under Nanling, and completely blocked large and small intersections at night. In order to cooperate with this action, a strong political offensive was launched, on the one hand, convening a meeting of family members of puppet troops, urging them to persuade their sons to return as soon as possible, on the other hand, posting notices and leaflets all over the Chiang Kai-shek's and puppet strongholds, or writing letters to Chiang Kai-shek's and puppet officers and soldiers through personal relationships to carry out heart-to-heart warfare.

    【本报特讯】自爱国自卫战争以来，蒋阎伪军被我人民解放军消灭其七十几个旅以后，兵力补充越感枯竭。特别在我军主动出击后，蒋阎伪军大部被我压缩于少数点线之内，广大农村已为我恢复或解放，敌人兵力与粮食已呈不支现象，于是向我解放区实行疯狂的抓丁抢粮，以挽救其危机，作死亡之挣扎。我边区某些地区，因为注意不够，曾遭受了些损失。为针对敌人抓丁抢粮阴谋，边府与军区特号召我全区党政军民紧急动员起来，对蒋阎伪军开展护丁护粮斗争，打断敌人的血手，特号召：一、所有边沿区、游击区、作战区青壮年，均应自愿参加我自卫队、民兵组织、武装起来，为保卫自己的身家性命进行游击战争。二、所有边沿区、游击区、作战区青壮年，因敌人一时强大，不可抗拒时，可以暂时投奔依托我军，服务战勤工作，粮食菜金由我发给。俟战争情况缓和，即可自由回家，决不强留。凡我正规军、地方兵团、游击队均有保护壮丁保护收割与尽可能的抽出力量参加收割之神圣义务。三、所有边沿区、游击区、作战区在夏收秋收时，应实行劳武结合，后方支援前方，突击收割。拿枪护田，保卫我们的粮食。四、麦收、秋收均应实行快收、快打、快晒、快藏做法，不使敌人抢走一颗粮食，必要时某些边沿区可以依托亲戚，向我内地转移存藏粮食。五、所有边沿区、游击区分派之公粮，要快屯快运，除留一小部支持当地游击战争吃用外，大部须运回内地，分散储藏。六、公私商店、合作社应握掌边沿区、游击区粮食买卖，尽可能的勿使落入敌手。七、在敌人抢粮抓丁时，我武工队、地方游击队须集中力量，打击消灭敌的抢掠队、抓丁队，并应实行村村联防，广泛开展游击战、地雷战，以封锁监视敌人。凡我正规军与地方兵团，务须就近予以有力的配合。八、每逢夏收、秋收时，要组织党政军民一元化力量，对敌展开政治攻势，打乱敌人的地方政权系统，消灭敌人的爪牙，使敌人抢粮抓丁失去依托。九、在敌集中一定兵力向我突击进攻时，我应适时转移粮食，分散保管，不使一粒资敌。

    【新华社晋冀鲁豫二十三日电】太岳边沿区济（源）孟（县）两县十万翻身农民，在“一手拿枪、一手拿镰，一面打仗、一面收割”的口号下，组成武装抢收队，准备麦收。区村之间组织抢收联防，在东至沁（阳）孟（县）边界，南至黄河沿岸之数百里地区，已纵横交织为一座坚固的联防堡垒。济源许多机动武装和飞行爆炸组已出发前线，配合孟县民兵围困南岭敌人。并于南岭下蟒河沿岸布置严密雷阵，入夜大小路口完全封锁。为配合此一行动，又展开强烈政治攻势，一面召集伪军家属会议，敦促他们劝其子弟早日来归，一面在蒋伪据点内遍贴布告传单，或通过私人关系写信给蒋伪官兵，进行攻心战。
