Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th: According to the Central News Agency, a joint delegation of students from eighteen colleges and universities in Beijing, Shanghai, Suzhou, and Hangzhou, petitioning to save the education crisis, presented written petitions to the Chiang government and the People's Political Council on the 23rd, demanding six points: (1) Immediately release all arrested students. (2) Severely punish Zhang Zhen, acting commander of the Nanjing Garrison Headquarters, Han Wenhuan, director of the Nanjing Police Department, Chen Shantong, director of the Eastern District Police Bureau, and the military police involved in the atrocities, and investigate responsibility for this tragedy. (3) Immediately abolish the "Temporary Measures for Maintaining Social Order." (4) Guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future. (5) Compensate for all losses. (6) Effectively guarantee freedom of person, speech, publication, assembly, association, and the right to demonstrate and petition. Agence France-Presse reports that the students' demands require a response within three days, or they will have to take new actions, and reconciliation will be impossible. According to the Central News Agency, the case has revealed nineteen seriously injured, one hundred and four slightly injured, and thirty-one arrested or missing. Currently, students at Central University have automatically donated over 10 million yuan to慰问 (console and express sympathy to) the injured students.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th: Following the Nanjing and Tianjin May 20th massacres, university and middle school students in Wuhan and Changsha have launched magnificent parades and demonstrations. According to the Central News Agency, on the 22nd, thousands of students from Wuhan University and other schools marched into the city (Wuchang) from Luojia Gate at 7:00 AM, shouting and posting slogans such as "Oppose the civil war," "Down with bureaucratic capitalism," and "Good men don't become soldiers." When the procession reached Central China University, they shouted, "Students with passion, come out quickly!" Subsequently, students from Central China University joined, and the procession passed through Hanyang Gate and arrived at the Hanyangmen Wharf. Because the Chiang authorities ordered all shipping companies to suspend operations to prevent students from crossing the river to Hankou, the procession turned to negotiate with the Chiang government's provincial government. The provincial government authorities avoided them in advance, and no one took responsibility. The students then wrote slogans and cartoons such as "Down with corrupt officials," and "Officials are fat while the people are thin" in the provincial government office, and carried out propaganda to the public on the spot. They returned to school via Yuema Factory at 5:00 or 6:00 PM. The authorities sent agents disguised as wounded soldiers to attempt to attack the students. The students were filled with激愤(righteous indignation) and the agents, seeing the situation was unfavorable, scurried away. Students at Hunan University in Changsha responded to students in other areas, announcing a strike against the civil war on the 21st and holding a parade demonstration on the 22nd. Chiang's military police and secret agents blockaded the Xiang River, attempting to prevent the procession from entering the city. The students detoured through Y湾市(Yu Wan Shi) near Houzi Stone and organized a swimming team to swim across the Xiang River, collecting more than thirty large and small boats to cross the river in batches, gathering outside the South Gate to enter the city. Thousands of male and female students from various schools participated, shouting slogans against the civil war and distributing leaflets along the way, before returning to their respective schools in teams at around 5:00 PM. In addition, Nanchang Zhongzheng Medical College and Nanjing Ginling Women's College also responded with strikes.
