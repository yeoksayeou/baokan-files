　　A Banner of Loving the People
  　Gui Shoujin's Stretcher Team
    Zhu Yaoting
  　I. Gui Shoujin and Guo Zhende
    The masses in the newly liberated AnYang New District, who had suffered greatly under Chiang Kai-shek's rule, were like startled birds when they first approached us. When the Gui Shoujin detachment of the Shexian stretcher team arrived at Qianliujiang Village, the young women hid in the cave dwellings, and the pots and bowls were buried; even firewood could not be bought.

    Gui Shoujin, who came from a hired labor background, had suffered much hardship in the past. Now that he had been emancipated, he was particularly sensitive to the suffering of the masses. He first approached his landlord, Guo Zhende, to offer help with his production. But to his surprise, Guo Zhende refused, saying, "I don't have any land, so where would I find work?" In Guo Zhende's view, there was no such thing as an army (he regarded the participating masses as the Eighth Route Army) helping ordinary people with their livelihood for nothing!

    Gui Shoujin understood his concerns. After inquiring about Guo Zhende's land in the street, he borrowed eleven hoes and mobilized eleven team members to secretly hoe eighteen mu of wheat for him in the morning. Only after the work was done did he invite him to inspect it. This fact dispelled Guo Zhende's doubts, and he hurriedly prepared a meal for the stretcher team, but everyone refused to eat a bite. Guo Zhende was truly moved. When the couple heard that one of the team members was ill, they immediately brought out their best quilt for the patient to use. They even patched up the trousers of two team members before feeling a little relieved.

    Guo Zhende listened attentively to everything Gui Shoujin said. Gui Shoujin told him about his past suffering, how he had been emancipated after the arrival of the Communist Party, and how he was now living a good life with food and clothing. These great truths of emancipation illuminated Guo Zhende's mind like fire. After listening, he couldn't help but spread the word to everyone he met.

    Guo Zhende's mother cursed that the Central Army had burned her spinning wheel, leaving the young women with nothing to do but be idle. Gui Shoujin comforted the old woman, saying, "If the Central Army burned your spinning wheel, our people can do anything, and we'll make you a new one."

    When Guo Zhende's wife saw that Gui Shoujin did not have a tobacco pouch, she carefully made one and gave it to him.
　  II. The Words in the Mute's Heart

    The leadership seized upon these typical examples of Gui Shoujin to educate everyone. After deliberation and discussion among the stretcher teams, many more model figures emerged.

    The Fourth Squad lived in the home of Guo, who was mute. The mute was frightened and looked worried, not daring to go out during the day.

    Squad leader Niu Yiqi, adopting Gui Shoujin's experience, led several team members to secretly hoe three mu of wheat for Guo the mute. Only after they finished did Guo the mute find out. Guo the mute laughed heartily when he saw it. Niu Yiqi saw that his thatch was used up, so he helped him carry thatch and carefully piled it up for him. The mute gesticulated, trying to express his thoughts to them, but he couldn't find the words, so he patted his chest anxiously to show his feelings. At dinner, he brought out the eighteen fine Jiangxi bowls he had kept hidden for a long time for them to use. After using them, he carefully put them away, doing this twice every day.

    Guo the mute's heart was like the hearts of the broad masses in the New District. He had many thoughts and feelings he wanted to pour out to his own people. One day, he gesticulated to the team members, trying to tell them his thoughts, but despite his great efforts, no one understood. Neighbors translated, and everyone finally understood. It turned out that his brother had been killed by the Central Army. The more he gesticulated, the more anxious the mute became. Suddenly, he ran home, took out a stick, and gestured that he wanted to fight the stubborn enemy and avenge his brother! He gestured that he wanted the squad leader to help him tie up his enemies and bring them back.

    One day, the stretcher team conducted a night march exercise. When they returned, the masses were frightened and dared not open their doors, but as soon as they heard it was the Shexian stretcher team, everyone opened their doors. The mute opened his door the fastest. He grabbed the team members and pulled them into his house, all the way to the kang (heated brick bed). He covered them with his quilt and told them to sleep on the kang, while he stood by the side.
  　III. Two Lines, Two Results

    Two bad examples were also discovered in the stretcher team. Niu Quanwang, Yang Qilu, and others were ruffians in the past. This time, they secretly went to gamble and also pulled up saplings from the villagers. The leadership then convened mass meetings of three brigades, with local villagers also participating. At the meeting, Gui Shoujin's model example was first reported, praised, and rewarded; Gui Shoujin's banner of "loving the people" was raised. Then, the facts of Niu Quanwang, Yang Qilu, and others violating mass discipline were reported. When the participating masses heard this, they demanded that they confess:

    "You are people from the old base area, why did you do such a thing?"

    "Quickly say what village you are from, don't disgrace all the people of Shexian!"

    "Quickly say your name, we are ashamed to be from the same village as you!"

    Under the pressure of the masses, Niu Quanwang and Yang Qilu, with pale faces, confessed their mistakes to the masses. The masses then forgave them and urged them to learn well.

    The New District masses who attended the meeting were very moved. Everyone said, "The Eighth Route Army really wants people to do good things!"

    At the end of the meeting, everyone was clamoring that they now clearly understood what the stretcher team should do.

    "Gui Shoujin is taking the mass line, which can both gain the support of the masses and be rewarded, bringing honor to the people of Shexian!"

    "Niu Quanwang and Yang Qilu violated mass discipline, were criticized and struggled against, losing face and causing disgrace!"

    With Gui Shoujin's banner of "loving the people" raised, all the detachments of the Shexian stretcher team are enthusiastically carrying out the Gui Shoujin movement.

　　一面民爱民的旗帜
  　桂守金担架队
    朱耀庭
  　一、桂守金和郭振德
    刚从蒋介石统治下解放出来的安阳新区群众，被蒋官兵苦害得太狠了，才接近我们时，还像受惊的小鸟一样。涉县的担架队桂守金分队，来到前柳江村时，年青的女人躲到窑洞里去了，锅碗埋藏了起来；连柴草也买不到。
    桂守金是个雇工出身，过去受过很多苛薄，现在翻了身，所以他最能体会群众的痛苦。他先找到房东郭振德，要帮助他搞生产。可是想不到郭振德却说：“自己没有地，那里来的营生，”而被拒绝了。在郭振德看来，世界上那有军队（他把参战群众也认成八路军了），凭空帮助老百姓干营生的事！
    桂守金摸着了他的心思，在街上打听好那是郭振德的地块后，便借了十一把锄头，动员了十一个队员，一上午偷偷的给他锄了十八亩麦子，锄好后再请他来验工。事实打破了郭振德的怀疑，连忙给担架队做好饭吃，但是大家却死也不吃他一口东西。郭振德可真是受感动了。两口子一听说一个队员病了，就连忙拿出一条顶好的被子叫病号盖上，也找着给两个队员补了裤子，才稍微安心了。
    桂守金说啥郭振德都在用心的听着。桂守金向他叙说着自己过去怎样受痛苦，共产党来后怎样翻了身，现在怎样过着有吃有穿的好时光。一片翻身大道理，像火一样照亮了郭振德的头脑，他听了后，忍不住见人就传播起来。
    郭振德的娘骂中央军把纺车给烧了火，小妞子闲着连花也不能纺。桂守金安慰老人家说：“中央军把你的纺车烧了火，我们的人啥也会干，给你做一个新的。”
    郭振德的老婆见桂守金吸烟没有烟荷包，很细心的做了一个送给他。
　  二、哑巴心里的话
    领导上抓住桂守金这些典型实例教育了大家，在各担架队中进行酝酿讨论后，又出现了许多模范人物。
    四中队住在郭哑子家中。哑巴吓得愁眉苦脸，白天也不敢出门。
    中队长牛义其，接受了桂守金的经验，便带了几个队员，偷偷的去给郭哑子锄了三亩麦子，锄完时才叫郭哑子知道，哑巴一见哈哈大笑起来。牛义其见他的茅子满了，就给他担茅子，还很地道的给他泼开。哑巴指手划脚的想把他心里的话说给他们，又说不出来，急得他拍拍胸口，表示了他的心意。晚上吃饭时，把藏了很久的十八个江西细碗拿出来给他们用，用过后，他仍细心的放起来，每天都要这样做两次。
    郭哑子的心和新区广大群众的心一样，他有好多心事话，要对自家人倾吐出来。一天他指手划脚的向队员们说自己的心事话，但费了很大的力气，大家还是不懂，邻人们给翻译，大家才算懂了。原来他哥哥叫中央军杀了。越比划哑子越急，突然跑回家中，拿出一根棍子来，比划着他要打顽军，替哥哥报仇！比划着要中队长能帮他把仇人捆回来。
    一天担架队进行夜行军演习，回来时群众都惊慌的不敢开门，但一说是涉县担架，大家都把门开开了。哑子开门最快，他拉住队员就往家中拉，一直拉到炕上去，他给他们盖上他的被子，叫他们在炕上睡，自己反站在一边。
  　三、两条路线两种结果
    担架队中也发现了两个不好的典型，牛全旺、杨启禄等三人，过去就是流氓，这次又偷偷去赌钱，还拔了老乡的小树。领导上就召开了三个大队的群众大会，当地群众也来参加，会上先把桂守金的模范实例做了报告，进行表扬和奖励；树起了桂守金这杆“民爱民”模范的大旗随后报告了牛全旺、杨启禄等破坏群众纪律的事实。参战群众一听，应声要求他们坦白：
    “你是老根据地人，为什么办出这种事？”
    “快说你是那个村的人，别丢全涉县人”！
    “快说你叫个啥，我们和你一个村嫌败兴！”
    牛全旺、杨启禄在群众的压力下，露着灰苍苍的脸，向群众坦白承认了错误。于是群众宽恕了他们，嘱咐他们要学好。
    参加会的新区群众看了很受感动，大家说：“八路军实在是要叫人作好事啊！”
    散会时大家在圪嚷，这一下子可明确懂得担架队该怎么办了。
    “桂守金走的群众路线，既能得到群众拥护又受到奖励，为涉县人争光！”
    “牛全旺、杨启禄破坏群众纪律，受批评挨斗争，丢人败兴！”
    桂守金“民爱民”模范的大旗竖起来了，涉县担架队各分队都热火朝天开展着桂金守运动。
