　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th: Washington dispatch: The Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) in the United States launched a large-scale campaign last week to oppose the anti-labor bill under consideration by Congress. The CIO placed full-page advertisements in more than 100 major newspapers and made radio appeals on various stations. The title of the advertisement was "Accusation to Truth," and its content stated that if the anti-labor bill under consideration by Congress is passed, it will inevitably endanger the freedom of labor rights, increase labor-management disputes, and lead to economic crises. Note: The anti-labor bill under consideration by the U.S. Congress was proposed by reactionary congressmen Taft, Ball, Smith, etc., and includes reactionary provisions such as restricting strikes and prohibiting workers from joining trade unions. As early as January and February of this year, it was opposed by the Chairman of the American Communist Party, Foster, the Congress of Industrial Organizations, and the Federation of Labor.

　　美国产业工联会反对反劳工法案
    【新华社陕北七日电】华盛顿讯：美国产业工会联合会，为了反对国会考虑中的反劳工法案，于上周发起一个大规模运动。该会曾在一百余家大报上刊登全版广告，并于各电台作广播呼吁。广告的标题为“向真理控诉”，内容略谓：国会考虑中之反劳工法案若被通过，势必危害劳动自由权利，并增加劳资纠纷及招致经济危机。按：美国会考虑中之反劳工法案为反动派议员塔虎脱、鲍尔、史密斯等所提出，其中包括限止罢工、禁止工人参加工会等反动规定。远在本年一、二月间，即为美共主席福斯特、产业工会联合会、劳工联合会等所反对。
