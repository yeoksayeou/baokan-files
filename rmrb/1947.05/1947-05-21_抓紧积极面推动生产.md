　　Grasp the Positive Aspects to Promote Production

　　Lucheng's Fifth District, after mobilizing for large-scale production in mid-April, has seen a gradual rise in the masses' enthusiasm for production after a month of exploration. In the process of exploration, it was discovered that district cadres had two different understandings of the masses' production enthusiasm after emancipation this year, resulting in two different approaches and two different outcomes. This district cadre meeting clarified the two lines in launching production.

　　Comrade Cui Kuanxin made a self-criticism, saying: "Last spring, when I was working in the village, I resolved the 'cutting chives' mentality before organizing mutual aid. This year, when I went to work in Xitiangong, I immediately asked Yong Sheng (the political director), 'Which family has a "cutting chives" mentality?' Yong Sheng said, 'It's not important this year.' I criticized Yong Sheng for not being thorough in his work and asked the person in charge of meal distribution to send meals to middle peasant families. After several days, I still couldn't find the 'cutting chives' mentality. I thought the masses weren't telling the truth, and I also felt incompetent for not even being able to find a 'cutting chives' mentality. Later, I mobilized the masses several times at meetings with the eight slogans proposed by the district, calling on everyone to 'emancipate again and again, get rich again and again,' and 'labor creates good times.' The masses' enthusiasm for production grew day by day. Production started, but I didn't know how it started. A member of the masses said that his carrying pole had blossomed, and he used the money from selling persimmons to buy an old ox. I didn't praise those who actively got rich, but only focused on the negative aspects, alienating myself from both the cadres and the masses, and my work suffered."

　　Comrade Chen Baofu made a self-criticism, saying: "The joint office asked me to understand the masses' production enthusiasm, so I focused on a village with many ideological problems and struggled against the middle peasants. When I arrived, the middle peasants had already been compensated. After investigating for several days, I couldn't find the 'cutting chives' mentality. I thought the masses weren't telling the truth, so I shifted to Licun to investigate and found several households with the 'cutting chives' mentality. I was very happy, thinking, 'I've finally found you.' During this period of working in Licungou, I discovered that Jin Shun's credit shop had 4,000 yuan in debt, so I raised the issue of hedonistic thinking at a meeting. The masses said, 'One piece of mutton ruins the whole pot of soup.' The more I criticized, the more dissatisfied the masses became. Later, the radio station praised Jin Shun for leading the oxen and women for pulling carts to carry manure. Jin Shun's enthusiasm was very high, and the women's enthusiasm was also very high, and everyone was mobilized. Liang Madou said, 'Don't think that more than forty full laborers have joined the army; with the women and children working, they are no weaker than if they were at home.' The day before yesterday, I was walking on the street and saw that many houses were locked, and the women were pushing carts to carry manure, working with great energy. Only then did I understand that I should grasp the positive aspects."

　　Every comrade made a self-criticism and also recognized that they had also grasped the positive aspects in their work to get the movement going, but their understanding was not clear at the time. Zhang Zhuang introduced the process of launching a campaign for cadres and the masses to perform meritorious service in production. Gaojiazhuang introduced the role of the radio station in praising activists, clarifying everyone's understanding.

　　The leadership summarized the following based on everyone's opinions:

　　Two understandings: First, after the emancipation movement, the 'cutting chives' mentality and the fear of getting rich were the main ideologies in the masses' production. Second, after the emancipation movement, production and getting rich were the basic demands of the masses; the 'cutting chives' mentality and the fear of getting rich were the ideas of a few individuals.

　　Two approaches: In grasping ideology: First, grasp negative ideology, look for the 'cutting chives' and the fear of getting rich mentality. If you can't find it, criticize the cadres, complain about the masses, and feel incompetent. Second, grasp positive ideological factors, and put forward moving propaganda slogans: "Get rich again and again, emancipate again and again," "Labor creates good times," "Rise step by step, let the carrying pole blossom," "Elm money is green, rectify mutual aid and get up at five o'clock; elm money is yellow, men, women, old and young are busy planting grain."

　　In grasping activists: First, find the 'cutting chives' mentality and "deduct ideology," trying to win over a few and cultivate them into activists. In reality, they were picking activists from backward elements, picking gun barrels from hemp stalks, and selecting generals from cripples. The real activists in production and the emancipation movement, because they did not have the 'cutting chives' mentality, were considered dishonest, spouting official jargon, and thrown aside. Second, call on the activists in the emancipation movement to become activists in the production movement, calling for adding merit to merit, launching a production merit campaign, and praising the newly emerged activists who are rising step by step and letting the carrying pole blossom. In doing so, a large number of activists have emerged. Rely on these people to connect and mobilize a few people with the 'cutting chives' mentality and the fear of getting rich mentality.

　　In style: First, more criticism, more administrative orders. Second, more encouragement, more praise, lively radio stations and mass blackboards.

　　Two results: First, binding the masses' production enthusiasm, alienating cadres and the masses, and working hard without success. Second, the movement is rapidly launched, the enthusiasm of the masses and cadres is high, and the work is carried out smoothly.

### 抓紧积极面推动生产

　　抓紧积极面推动生产
    潞城五区从四月中旬动员大生产，经过一个月的摸索，群众生产情绪逐渐高涨起来。在摸索的过程中，发现区干部对今年翻身后群众生产情绪有着两种认识，因而产生两种做法，得到两种结果。这次区干部会上清算了发动生产中的两条路线。
    崔宽心同志检讨说：去年春天，我在村工作时，是解决了割韭菜思想再组织互助。今年到西天贡工作，一去就问永盛（政治主任）“谁家是割韭菜思想？”永盛说：“今年没要紧，”我就批评永盛说他工作不深入，让派饭的给我往中农家派，派了几天还找不见割韭菜思想，我认为群众不说老实话，又觉得自己没出息，连个割韭菜思想都找不到，以后把区上提的八个口号在大会上动员几次，叫大家“翻身再翻身、发家再发家”，“劳动创造好时光”，群众生产情绪一天比一天高。生产搞起来了，我也不知道怎样搞起来的。有个群众说他扁担开了花，担卖柿子换了个老牛。我不表扬积极发家的，光抓消极面，脱离了干部也脱离了群众，工作吃了亏。
    陈保富同志检讨说：联合办公室让我了解群众生产情绪，我就抓了一个思想多的村，斗争中斗了中农的村。我去的时候，中农已经补偿了，调查好几天，调查不出割韭菜思想，心想群众不说老实话，就转移到李村调查，发现了几户割韭菜思想，心里非常高兴，心想“我可找到你了”。这一段在李村沟工作，发现金顺赊饭铺四千元，就在大会提出享乐思想，群众说：“一块羊肉满锅腥汤”，我越批评，群众越不满意。以后广播电台表扬了金顺驾辕和妇女拉车拉粪，金顺情绪非常高，妇女情绪也非常高，大家动起来了。梁马斗说：“你别看参战走了四十多个全劳力，妇女儿童干起来，比他们在家也不弱”。前天我在街上走，看见许多家都锁了门，妇女们推车拉粪搓粪干的一股劲，这才懂得应当抓住积极面。
    每个同志都作了检讨，同时也认识到自己工作中也曾抓住积极面，才把运动搞起来，不过当时认识不明确。张庄介绍了开展干群生产立功的经过。高家庄介绍了广播电台表扬积极分子起的作用，使大家在认识上明确起来。
    领导上根据大家意见总结了一下：
    两种认识：一、翻身运动后，割韭菜思想和不敢发财思想是群众生产中主要思想。二、翻身运动后，生产发家是群众基本要求，割韭菜思想和不敢发财思想是少数人，个别人的思想。
    两种做法：在掌握思想上：一、抓消极思想，找割韭菜不敢发财思想，找不见就批评干部，埋怨群众，觉得自己没本事。二、掌握积极的思想因素，提出动人的宣传鼓动口号：“发家再发家、翻身再翻身”，“劳动创造好时光”，“步步登高，扁担开花”，“榆钱青，整顿互助起五更；榆钱黄，男女老少种谷忙”。
    在掌握积极分子上：一、找到割韭菜思想，就“扣思想”，企图打通几个，把他培养成积极分子，实际上是在落后分子中挑积极分子，是在麻杆里挑枪杆，蹶子里选将军；真正的生产和翻身运动的积极分子，因为没有割韭菜思想，就被认为不老实，打官腔，扔到一边。二、号召翻身运动中的积极分子，变成生产运动中的积极分子，号召功上加功，开展生产立功运动，表扬新涌现的步步登高和扁担开花的积极分子，这样做已经涌现出大批积极分子。依靠这些人，去串通发动少数有割韭菜思想和不敢发家思想的人。
    作风上：一、批评多，行政命令多。二、鼓励多，表扬多，广播电台、大众黑板活跃。
    两种结果：一、束缚着群众生产情绪，脱离干部和群众费力搞不好。二、运动迅速开展，群众干部情绪高涨，工作顺利进行。
