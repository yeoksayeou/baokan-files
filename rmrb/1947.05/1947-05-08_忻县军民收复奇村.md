Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 6th. After more than a month of encirclement operations, the military and civilians of the Xinxian liberated area successively recovered seven strongholds of the Yan clique in Qicun and Yiti, west of Xinxian County, at the end of last month, forcing the Yan-puppet troops back to the suburbs of Xinxian County. When the Yan army invaded the above-mentioned areas in mid-March, the county organized armed village governments to penetrate the grid network of the Yan clique strongholds and persist in the struggle. Counter-revolutionary landlords in villages such as Songjialiang maintained the Yan clique, but were captured by the guerrilla village government in just three days. Guerrilla teams attacked armed secret agents everywhere, intercepted Yan army supplies, and laid mines everywhere, completely isolating the strongholds and making it impossible to move. On the 13th, 17th, and 24th of last month, the Yan army harassed the area several times, but was driven back by landmines, killing and wounding dozens of people below the company and platoon leader level. Fearing annihilation, the Yan clique fled back to Xinxian County in a panic on the 27th, 28th, and 29th of last month.

　　忻县军民收复奇村
    【新华社晋绥六日电】忻县解放区的军民经月余的围困作战，于上月底连续收复忻县城西之奇村、依提等阎顽据点七处，将阎伪逼退至忻县城郊。三月中旬阎军侵占上述各地，该县即组织武装村公所，深入阎顽据点的格子网内坚持斗争。宋家梁等村反动地主维持阎顽，仅三天即被游击村公所捕去。游击队到处打击武装特务，截夺阎军给养，到处埋雷。使据点完全孤立，寸步难行。上月十三、十七、二十四日阎军数次出扰，均被地雷炸回。毙伤其连排长以下数十人。阎顽惧被歼灭，于上月二十七、二十八、二十九先后狼狈窜忻县城。
