　　Xinhua News Agency, Tongpu Frontline, 28th Urgent Telegram: The Taiyue People's Liberation Army captured Xiangning County, one of Yan Xishan's lairs, on the 25th, annihilating the 204th Regiment of the 68th Division and the 15th Regiment of the 9th Special District Security Force, totaling more than 2,700 men. Preliminary battle results show that over 200 were killed or wounded, and the commissioner Liu Hansen, Zhang Jingshun, commander of the 204th Regiment, Zhang Zhilu, deputy commander, and more than 2,500 others were captured alive. Sixteen light and heavy mortars, twelve heavy machine guns, over a hundred light machine guns, over a thousand rifles, and over twenty telephones were seized, with other items still being inventoried. Yan Xishan had spent a great deal of effort building deep trenches, high ramparts, and over a hundred various pillboxes within a five-mile radius around Xiangning city, boasting that the city's fortifications were stronger than those of Taiyuan.
　　[This newspaper, Taigu News] The enemy's 2nd Battalion of the Luo Regiment of the 9th General Column, stationed in Rencun, Taigu, was fully equipped with Japanese weaponry. On September 17th, it mobilized over 200 men, carrying one mountain gun, eighty carts, and over a hundred civilians, advancing in two directions to attack and plunder Fancun. When they arrived at Yancun, they were ambushed by local militia. The enemy then carried out large-scale looting in Yancun, stealing over 25 *shi* of coarse and fine grains, destroying all utensils, and searching every inch for clothing scraps and broken shoes. Our Jia Mao Monkey Home Guard, in coordination with a unit of a certain regiment, resolutely tracked and pursued the enemy, eventually defeating them. In addition to intercepting some of the grain, over 20 enemy soldiers, including the battalion commander, were killed or wounded, and five bayonets, four steel helmets, and over ten shells were captured. We suffered only one minor injury. (Zemin)
　　[This newspaper, Taiyue, 27th Telegram] Taking advantage of Yan's stubborn panic and unease, our Jiexiu militia launched a "digging out the heart" offensive. On the night of the 11th of this month, the guerrilla and working teams of the Third District, in coordination with the "Flying Feet" Tai Shichang and others from the Hedong militia, raided the enemy's key stronghold of Nanliangshui, capturing eleven Yan puppet troops alive in a fierce battle lasting twenty minutes. One 60mm mortar, eight rifles, six shells, one hundred and fifty bullets, and ten hand grenades were seized. The Zhangliang militia, active within the grid network of Zhangliang and Yi'an, raided the villages of Zhangliang, Hongshan, Donggu, and Daxu several times on the 11th, killing or capturing eleven enemy soldiers.
