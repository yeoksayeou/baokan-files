　　Xinhua News Agency, Shaanxi-Gansu Front, Urgent Telegram, 25th: The county seat of Xunyi (Sanshui), 120 kilometers northwest of Xi'an, was completely occupied by a unit of the Northwest People's Liberation Army on the 22nd. Taking advantage of the victory, the unit advanced southward and recaptured Zhanghong, an important town between Xunyi and Binzhou, on the 23rd, directly threatening the Xi'an-Lanzhou Highway. Note: Xunyi was once recovered by the People's Liberation Army in March of this year. This second liberation is the second major victory on the southern front of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region after the capture of Yaoxian. In the battle to capture Xunyi, more than 200 members of Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan's Shaanxi Security Force were captured, and three machine guns, more than 150 rifles, and a large amount of other ammunition, flour, and other materials were seized.

    【新华社陕北前线二十五日急电】西安西北一百二十公里之栒邑（三水）县城，二十二日已为西北人民解放军一部完全占领。该部乘胜向南推进，二十三日复攻克栒邑彬州间之张洪重镇，直接威胁西（安）兰（州）公路。按：栒邑于本年三月曾为人民解放军一度收复，此次重获解放，为陕甘宁边区南线继攻克耀县后之第二次大胜利。在攻克栒邑之战中，俘获蒋胡陕西保安队二百余人，缴获机枪三挺，步枪一百五十余支，其他弹药、面粉等物资甚多。
