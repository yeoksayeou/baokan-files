This Newspaper Reporter Wu Xiang Comments
	Wang Zhonglian is Cowardly and Incompetent
[This newspaper, Frontline of Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 30th dispatch] Frontline reporter Wu Xiang commented on the cowardice and incompetence of Chiang Kai-shek's defeated generals Wang Zhonglian and Sun Zhen, saying: This time, four brigades of Chiang's army risked their lives to cross the Wei River and invade northward. Wang Zhonglian personally went to Weixianji, Qixian County, north of the Wei River, to command the western route, and Sun Zhen personally went to Junxian County, on the edge of the Wei River, to command the eastern route. These two frequently defeated generals suddenly put on a brave appearance and "courageously" took personal command, as if to say, "Watch this time!" As a result, in less than three days, we saw entire brigades and regiments annihilated, and tens of thousands captured. We saw countless floating corpses and wronged souls drowning in the Wei River, and we saw the frequently defeated generals reveal their cowardly and incompetent nature, abandoning their troops in panic and fleeing, leading to a complete military collapse that was beyond repair. Their embarrassment was even worse than any time they didn't personally command. Last September, when the entire 3rd Division was annihilated, they retreated to Dongming and Kaocheng and stopped. Last December, when the 41st and 47th Divisions had a brigade and a half annihilated in Shangguancun, Shaoerzhai, and other places, the Chiang's army in Hua County and Changyuan still relied on fortifications to barely hold on. This time, Qixian County on the western route was recovered by us. And Junxian County, where Sun Zhen was stationed, had the Wei River as a barrier, fortifications that had been painstakingly built for more than half a year, and Hua County and Daokou to provide mutual support. Unfortunately, after the slightest disturbance, they were so frightened that they dared not stop to catch their breath. Last month, General Liu Bocheng's troops marched westward in great strides, and the Chiang's army abandoned five county towns in fright. In this helpless situation, the frequently defeated generals actually declared with self-deprecating humor, "We don't care about the gains and losses of a city or a place." Their shamelessness is truly unexpected! Of course, they can shamelessly declare that they "don't care about the gains and losses of a city or a place" when they flee from Junxian, Hua County, and Daokou. But at the same time, they left behind more than 10,000 artillery shells and hundreds of thousands of catties of military grain. Is this also because they "don't care," or is it because they were panicked when they fled? The most suitable work for these frequently defeated generals is to shrink in their faraway tortoise shells and issue orders in a muddle-headed way, rather than pretending to be "brave" and personally commanding, because: First, if they shrink in their faraway tortoise shells and issue orders, they can push the responsibility onto the front-line commanders when they fail. Second, if they are not at the front, they will of course be "sad" when their troops are annihilated, but witnessing their own troops' lack of fighting will, wavering, and confusion at the front will inevitably cause some "pessimistic emotions," and there is also a great risk of being captured. Of course, the frequently defeated generals have suffered many defeats at the hands of General Liu Bocheng and have learned some lessons. As soon as they see that things are not going well, they turn around and run away, to hell with orders and troops! This is the entire skill of these frequently defeated generals, Wang Zhonglian and Sun Zhen, and it is a major development in their tactics!
[This newspaper, Northern Henan Frontline, 29th dispatch] According to recent investigations, the regimental commander of the 379th Regiment of the 127th Brigade of the 47th Division of Chiang's army was killed when the entire regiment was annihilated. In the huge group of prisoners, Lin Hejun, the lieutenant colonel staff officer of the 49th Brigade, was also recently found among them.

    王仲廉懦怯无能
    【本报冀鲁豫前线三十日电】前线记者吴象评述蒋家败将王仲廉、孙震之懦怯无能称：此次蒋军四个旅冒死渡卫河北犯，王仲廉亲至卫河北淇县属之魏贤集指挥西路，孙震亲至卫河边之浚县指挥东路，这两位常败将军忽然装出一副雄赳赳的样子，“勇敢”地亲自出马，似乎在说：“这一回看吧！”于是不出三天，我们就又看到整旅整团的歼灭，成千成万的被俘。看到淹死在卫河里无数的浮尸冤魂，看到常败将军露出懦怯无能的本相，弃众惊逃，以至全军溃乱，无可收拾。其狼狈较之他们未亲自出马的任何一次更甚。去年九月整三师被歼，他们败退到东明、考城就停住了。去年十二月四一师、四七师在上官村、邵耳寨等处被歼一个半旅，滑县、长垣的蒋军仍据险勉强撑持。这一次西路淇县被我收复。而孙震坐镇的浚县有卫河作屏障，有惨淡经营了半年以上的城垣工事，有滑县、道口可作犄角之呼应。惜乎风声鹤唳之余，已吓得不敢停脚喘息了。上月刘伯承将军所部大踏步西进，路过一趟，吓跑了五座县城的蒋军。在此无可奈何的情况下，常败将军们竟自己解嘲似的宣称：“不在乎一城一地之得失”了。其厚颜无耻，真出人意料！当然，他们之从浚县、滑县、道口逃跑，他们可以大言不惭的宣称“不在乎一城一地的得失”，但是同时留下了一万多发炮弹，数十万斤军粮，难道也是因为“不在乎”，而不是逃走时惊慌失措吗？对于这些常败将军最适宜的工作，还是缩在远远的乌龟壳里糊里糊涂地发号施令，而不是冒充“勇敢”亲自出马指挥，因为：第一、自己缩在远远的乌龟壳里发号施令，失败时可把责任推到前边的指挥官；第二、自己不在前边，部队被歼灭当然也“伤心”，但在前边目睹自己部队原来如此缺乏战斗意志，动摇混乱难免引起些“悲观情绪”，并且还有被俘的极大危险。当然，常败将军们在刘伯承将军手下吃败仗已经很多，已学了些乖，一见大事不妙，扭头飞跑，什么命令和部队，管他娘！这就是王仲廉、孙震这些常败将军的全部本领，他们在战术上的重大发展！
    【本报豫北前线二十九日电】近据查明蒋军四十七师一二七旅三七九团团长已于该团全部就歼时击毙。在庞大的俘虏群中，近又发现四十九旅中校参谋主任林鹤军亦在其中。
