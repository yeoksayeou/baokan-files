　　[This article transmitted from Taiyue on the 27th] The Taiyue and JinSui local guerrilla forces have formed a steel-like joint defense, encircling the Jiang Yan troops in Hongdong. On April 11th, our Taiyue Ludong militia, in coordination with the JinSui Second District Detachment of Hexi, attacked Yan troops moving south from Zhaocheng at Shizheng Village, killing six enemies including a battalion commander, and capturing three alive. They seized one pistol and over 2.6 million Jiang currency. On May 15th, our Gao Huida combat team and a unit of the Ludong militia, taking the enemy by surprise, raided the Jiang-controlled township office in Denglin Village, Hexi (20 li northwest of Hongdong), killing the township head Zhang Jiangshan and capturing seven, seizing six rifles. On the 16th, our militia from four townships in Hexi intercepted enemy forces invading Langjia Village, killing and wounding two, and capturing one alive. On the 17th, a unit of our JinSui guerrilla force, in coordination with the Ludong Gao Huida combat team and militia, ambushed Yan troops harassing Mamudi (13 li northwest of Hongdong), capturing 11 Yan soldiers alive including Kang Lishi, the chief of the Fourth District of Hongdong, and seizing one machine gun and five rifles. Currently, the Jiang Yan troops in Hongdong are in a state of extreme panic due to our encirclement.
