　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th: Shanghai reports: An unusually high number of fire alarms in Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places has become a serious threat to urban residents. In Nanjing, from New Year's Day to March 24th, a total of 73 fire alarms occurred, with losses to citizens reaching 2.78 billion yuan, equivalent to the total fire losses for the entire previous year. In Shanghai, there were 111 fire alarms in January, 113 in February, and as many as 71 in the first half of March, with three days seeing more than eight fires per day. The largest fire in the past three months was the major fire on Wuding Road in Shanghai on the evening of the Lunar New Year's Day, which burned continuously for 13 hours. The losses to the family of Wang Yunfu, the manager of the Sanyou Industrial Society, alone were estimated at 6,000,000,000 Chiang Kai-shek yuan. The fire on Jin Shenfu Road on March 10th burned as many as seven factories, including the China Industrial Dyeing and Weaving Factory, with losses exceeding 10,000,000,000 yuan. The entire warehouse of the family industrial society, which had been established for over 30 years, was destroyed, with estimated losses of at least 10,000,000,000 yuan. General public opinion believes that the fundamental causes of the fire alarms are the political corruption of the Chiang Kai-shek government, the chaotic urban order, and the dilapidated fire-fighting equipment. In the past, during the "Concession" era, the annual budget for fire-fighting in Shanghai was 15 percent, but now, while revenue has increased, the fire-fighting budget has been reduced to 2 percent. There is also embezzlement and corruption in the funds. Zhou Zhaoxiang, the head of the Chiang Kai-shek Fire Department in Shanghai, even used the funds approved by the Chiang Kai-shek Shanghai Municipal Council without purchasing fire-fighting equipment. During the Wuding Road fire, the rescue vehicles used were all old items received, and the Chiang Kai-shek government had not added a single foot of hose. Chiang Kai-shek's fire-fighting personnel even took advantage of the blazing flames to loot property; for example, Huang Baoqi and Li Ren, the fire chiefs of the Jing'an and Xinzha districts of Shanghai, were accused of this. The people of Nanjing and Shanghai are extremely angry about the frequent fires. The 13th issue of the Commentary Newspaper on March 2nd stated that the people in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas are "tax-paying citizens," meaning that the people only have the obligation to pay taxes, but no guarantee of safety.

　　蒋党政治腐败都市秩序混乱
    京沪等地火灾奇多
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】沪报讯：京沪等地火警奇多，已成为都市人民严重的威胁。南京自元旦日起至三月二十四日止，共发生火警七十三次，市民损失达二十七亿八千余万元，与去年全年火灾损失相等。上海一月份火警一百一十一次，二月份一百一十三次，而三月上半月竟达七十一次，其中日达八次以上者有三天。三个月来最大的一次则是农历元旦晚间的上海武定路大火，连续燃烧达十三小时之久，仅三友实业社经理王云甫一家，损失估计值蒋币六十万万元。三月十日金神父路大火，仅被焚工厂达七家之多，其中中国实业染织厂损失达一百亿元以上，创设三十余年的家庭工业社堆栈全部焚毁，估计损失最低亦在百亿以上。一般舆论均认为引起火警之基本原因，系由蒋政府政治腐败，都市秩序混乱，消防设备窳陋所致。过去“租界”时代，上海市消防经费全年预算百分之十五，而现在收入增加，而消防经费反降低为百分之二。经费中又有贪污舞弊，上海蒋记消防处处长周兆祥竟动用上海市蒋记参议会所通过拨给的经费，而迟迟未办消防器材。此次武定路大火时，所用的救济车均系接收旧物，而蒋政府并未添过一尺皮带。蒋记消防人员且竟有乘烈焰腾空之时趁火打劫者；如上海静安、新闸两区消防分队长黄宝琦、李仁等即以此被控。京沪人民对火灾频繁极表愤怒，三月二日十三期评论报称：蒋管区人民为“纳税公民”，按即人民只有纳税义务，而无任何安全保障。
