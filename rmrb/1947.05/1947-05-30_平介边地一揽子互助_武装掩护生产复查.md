　　Pingjie Border Area Integrated Mutual Aid
  　Armed Escort for Production Review
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 28th dispatch] In the Pingyao-Jiexiu border area, during the rush to spring plowing, the combination of labor and military, and the combination of production and emancipation, repelled enemy harassment, protected emancipation, and protected production. Jiexiu proposed slogans such as "Reduce meeting time during the day, change large meetings into small meetings," "Cadres go to the fields to participate in labor and lead the struggle," and "The masses labor in the fields while brewing [struggle]," to rush spring plowing and conduct a review. In Quanquan Village, a coal-producing area in the First District, the masses carried out "two-pronged efforts," producing during the day and emancipating themselves at night. Zhang Wanshun, a hero of emancipation in Beishantou, has now been elected by the masses as the production captain, leading the masses to dig licorice root for ten days, earning 30 shi of millet. He distributed 500 jin of his own saved yam to the poor who had no yam, and borrowed two large oxen from Cheng Zhongyi from another village to plow the land for military dependents and families of martyrs. Xia Li Hou is very close to the Hongshan Zhangliang enemy stronghold. Militiamen are on guard at the head of the fields, and the masses are rushing to plant day and night. Cheng Zhongyi, a double hero of fighting and emancipation in the village, injured his right leg while researching and modifying hand grenade landmines. Although his injury has not fully healed, he is still going to the railway line with his illness to cover work. In Hou Yaitou, the Second District, a village-wide mutual aid team was established, divided into twelve groups, with cadres and activists participating separately. During spring plowing, they squeezed out time to connect with the masses to brew struggle, and once brewing was mature, they held meetings at night to carry out struggle. In ×× Village in the Third District, which is close to the enemy's old nest of Jiexiu City, the village command uniformly leads the organization. Every day, a squad of militiamen is sent to guard the north of the village, and the remaining militiamen, cadres, and masses go to the fields together to rush spring plowing. Under the leadership of combat hero Zhang Sanhu, Shangliang Village is now rushing the "half mu of flowers" (per person) campaign. All the militiamen in the village, in addition to fighting, also participated in production. In Dongjiazhuang, Shangjiazhuang, and Zaolin Village in the Fourth District of Pingyao, armed village commands were established in mid-April, implementing the "integrated" leadership and mutual aid, rushing production during the day under the guard of treetops, and quickly brewing struggles during rest. Land reform was carried out at night within the landmine blockade line.
