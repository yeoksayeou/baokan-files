　　Cadres Frequently Go to the Countryside to Strengthen Production Leadership
    Taihang Third Administrative Office Changes Leadership Methods
    [This newspaper's Taihang dispatch] The Taihang Third Administrative Office, in the past two months, combined the establishing merit campaign with leadership inspection, and also had a more profound review of the leadership role in the previous production movement in the administrative office. The leadership methods have been improved. The previous problems were: (1) Unable to understand the situation at the lower levels in a timely manner, just sitting in the office, waiting for materials, complaining that the counties had materials, but the materials lacked research. (2) Vague instructions, mostly not in line with reality, and often "hindsight" (not timely). (3) Each department emphasized its own interests and was disconnected from the central work. Sometimes, people were reluctantly sent down, and it was considered "cooperation," forming a burden. Therefore, the administrative office showed weakness in guiding the central work, and the work suffered losses. After recent research, first of all, the concept of each department serving the central work is clearer. Several meetings of each system have implemented the viewpoint of serving the central work. For example, the Finance and Grain Section organizes production to open up financial resources, reduce the burden on the people, balance labor service burdens, work-study grading, and give play to civilian labor to solve the labor difficulties in production. Judicial work is engaged in civil mediation in the organization of the production movement, eliminating disputes in mutual aid groups. In specific practices: (1) Reduce the number of personnel in the office, go to the countryside more, and organize work groups according to different stages of movement development, go deep into the villages to directly obtain experience, discover and summarize mass creations. Recently, nine comrades have focused on going to various counties to create specific experiences in which departmental work serves the central work. (2) Select typical new and old areas to establish contact areas and contact villages. The second district of Changzhi and Nantianhe Village in the new area, the first district of Licheng and Xiazhuang Village, and the first district of Pingshun and Wangzhuang Village in the old area are designated as contact areas and villages as a basis for understanding the situation. (3) Clarify the task of the Construction Section as technical guidance, overcome the phenomenon of average use of forces in the past movement, and especially focus on the combination of mass experience and science. (4) Exchange experiences in a timely manner through the Party newspaper and the administrative office's newsletter. (Taihang Third Administrative Office Office)

　　干部经常下乡  加强生产领导
    太行三专署改变领导方法
    【本报太行讯】太行三专署两月来，结合立功运动与检查领导，对专署以往生产运动中的领导作用，亦有较深刻的检讨，领导方法有所改进，以前的毛病是：（一）不能及时了解下边情况，只是坐机关，等材料，没有材料埋怨县有了，材料又缺乏研究。（二）泛泛的指示，多不切合实际，甚至常放“马后炮”（不及时）。（三）各科强调本位，与中心工作脱节，有时勉强抽人下去，也认为是“配合”，形成负担，因而专署在中心工作指导上，表现无力，工作受到损失。经最近研究，首先是各部门为中心工作服务的观念较明确，各系统的几次会议，都贯彻了为中心工作服务的观点，如财粮科以组织生产开辟财源，减轻民负，与平衡力役负担，勤工评分，发挥民力，解决生产中的劳力困难。司法工作，在组织生产运动中，从事民间调解，把纠纷消灭在互助组里。在具体做法上：（一）减少机关人员，多下乡，依运动发展不同阶段，组织工作组，深入到村，直接取得经验，发现并总结群众创造。最近已有九个同志有重点的分赴各县，在工作中创造部门工作为中心工作服务的具体经验。（二）选择新老区的典型，建立联系区与联系村，新区以长治的二区和南天河村、老区以黎城一区和霞庄村、平顺的一区和王庄村为联系区村，作为了解情况的依托。（三）明确建设科的任务为技术指导，克服过去在运动中平均使用力量的现象，特别着重群众经验与科学相结合。（四）通过党报，专署通讯及时交流经验。（太行三专署办公室）
