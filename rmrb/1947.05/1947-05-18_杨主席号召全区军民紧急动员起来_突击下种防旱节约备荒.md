Chairman Yang Calls on the Military and Civilians of the Entire Region to Mobilize Urgently
    Rush to Plant, Prevent Drought, Conserve, and Prepare for Famine

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] On the 14th of this month, Chairman Yang, at a conference of cadres directly under the border region, called for an urgent mobilization to lead the masses in a rush to plant crops, prevent drought, and prepare for famine. He said: The war of self-defense has reached its most intense stage and is about to crest the hill. To guarantee supplies for the war and meet the needs of the masses, we must fulfill the requirements put forward by the People's Daily editorial and the Xinhua News Agency editorial: treat spring planting as an urgent matter like winning a battle, and win a major victory in production. However, the current situation is very urgent, and there is a possibility of famine. Since the beginning of spring, the entire region has generally experienced more wind and less rain, and the wheat harvest is certain to be reduced. Even in good areas, it will not exceed 70% of normal. Spring planting has already been affected by the drought. According to recent information, except for Fan County and areas south and west of it in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region, and parts of the second and fourth districts of Taihang and the second and fourth districts of Taiyue, which have experienced light rain, the rest of the region is experiencing a serious drought, affecting planting. The Beginning of Summer has passed, and Grain Full is approaching. If we do not make timely efforts to find solutions and instead wait for the weather, it goes without saying that the autumn harvest will be greatly reduced, and there is a danger of famine, which will inevitably greatly affect the victory of the patriotic self-defense war! We must be highly vigilant against the difficulties of famine during the war of resistance, promote the valuable experience of overcoming natural disasters in the past, and increase our confidence to complete the urgent task of spring planting as if it were winning a battle! Chairman Yang highly praised certain areas of Taihang, such as Pingshun, Lucheng, Huguan, Changzhi, Heshun, Zuoquan, and Xingtai counties, for sharing water to plant seeds and striving to complete the planting of one million mu of cotton. He highly commended certain places in Taihang, Taiyue, and the plains for starting rush planting early, especially Jincheng, where many villages mobilized and organized a large number of women to participate in agricultural labor to complete planting, without delaying war support and land reform. He expressed great satisfaction with the loud calls from the leading organs and newspapers in various districts for rush planting! He then loudly called on all cadres directly under the border region and cadres at all levels of government to mobilize urgently, especially district and village cadres, to promote the experience of leading the masses through famine and overcoming difficulties in 1942 and 1943, and to do everything possible locally to organize, help, and coordinate with the masses to carry water and plant seeds. Plant one seed is one seed, harvest one seed is one more seed; accumulate the small to make the great, and human determination will conquer nature. Some areas can dig canals and wells to prevent drought and famine. Chairman Yang especially emphasized the role of cadres taking the lead in doing things themselves, urging everyone to learn from the exemplary actions of Vice Director Jia of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Administrative Office, who, at over sixty years old, personally held the plow last autumn to plant land for the masses, and from Comrade Cao Xun, the director of the Jinnan Daily, and the county magistrate of Neiqiu County, who recently took the lead in carrying water and planting seeds for the masses, as well as from the Taiyue organs organizing teams to cultivate more than a thousand mu of land for the masses. The various units directly under the border region have also cultivated a hundred mu as a substitute, and should continue to do so, taking a few days, and stopping work if necessary, to help the masses plant seeds, in order to solve the labor difficulties caused by participation in the war and to overcome the idea of relying on heaven for food among some of the masses. Chairman Yang further called on everyone to conserve and prepare for famine. He recalled the spirit of cadres eating bran and vegetables with the masses during the severe famine in our region in 1943, and the hard work of all personnel, united from top to bottom, in practicing strict economy to overcome the famine. He said: Everyone has a deep understanding of this aspect, and we should further implement the Central Bureau's call for production and conservation. We should not only ensure that organs solve their own difficulties and individuals solve their own difficulties, and never increase financial expenditures, but also save food for famine preparedness. Each organ can carry out a campaign to save two liang (approximately 100 grams) of rice per person per day, which should be stored by each organ for emergencies. Chairman Yang emphasized that the issue of conservation should also be thoroughly implemented at the lower levels, especially the conservation of the masses is particularly important. We must educate and overcome the wasteful phenomena among some of the masses after they have been emancipated. The people of our region have a deep experience of the pain of famine, and they will also know that wasting a little will reduce a little of the strength to fight Chiang Kai-shek. It is easy for the broad masses to understand and accept the timely raising of awareness about famine, saving food, ensuring military food for the patriotic self-defense war, and reducing hunger in the future. Chairman Yang finally encouraged everyone, saying: This year, we must guarantee the supply to the front lines, win battles, implement land reform, and carry out a large-scale production movement. The tasks are very heavy, and we must strive a hundred times harder, grit our teeth, work hard, thoroughly overcome any degenerate thoughts, and not forget the various difficulties, especially financial difficulties, because of military progress. Only by facing difficulties together and taking a long-term perspective can we overcome difficulties and overcome difficulties. We must also improve our work style, become tense, and complete the glorious task with a fighting posture!

　　杨主席号召全区军民紧急动员起来
    突击下种防旱节约备荒
    【本报特讯】本月十四日，杨主席在边直干部大会上号召，紧急动员起来，领导群众进行突击下种，防旱备荒。他说：自卫战争已经到了最紧张的阶段，即将爬过山头，为了保证战争的供应与满足群众要求，必须作到如人民日报社论和新华社社论所提出的要求：把春耕下种当做如打胜仗一样的紧急事情来作，在生产上打一个大胜仗。但是目前情况很紧急，有发生灾荒的可能。入春以来，全区一般是风多雨少，麦子减收已定，好的地区也不会超过七成。春耕下种已因天旱受到影响。根据最近了解，除冀鲁豫范县以南以西，太行二、四分区及太岳二、四分区的部分地区曾先后落了小雨外，其余全区则均呈现严重旱象，影响下种。立夏已过，小满即来，如不及时努力想办法而等待天时，不用说今秋会大大歉收的，并且还有发生灾荒的危险，势必大大影响爱国自卫战争的胜利！必须高度警惕抗战中的灾荒困难，发扬过去战胜天灾的宝贵经验，提高信心来完成打胜仗一样紧急的春耕下种工作！杨主席对于太行某些地区如平顺、潞城、壶关、长治、和顺、左权、邢台等县分担水点种，大力争取完成一百万亩的植棉任务，倍加赞许。对于太行、太岳以及平原某些地方提早突击下种，特别对于晋城很多村庄动员与组织起来广大妇女参加农业劳动完成下种，不误战勤与土地改革，予以高度表扬。对于各区领导机关与报纸大声呼喊突击下种，深表满意！继即大声号召边直全体干部以及各级政府干部紧急动员起来，特别是区村干部，发扬四二、四三两年领导群众渡荒克服困难的经验，尽当地一切可能，组织、帮助、协同群众担水点种。种一粒是一粒，收一粒多一粒；积少成多，人定胜天。有的地区可以开渠打井防备旱荒。杨主席特别强调干部带头亲自动手的作用，要大家向冀鲁豫行署六十多岁的贾副主任去年秋天亲自扶犁为群众种地，最近冀南日报社长草循同志，内邱县县长带头为群众担水点种的模范行动以及太岳各机关组织代耕种、远征队为群众耕地千余亩等等学习。边直各单位亦代耕百亩，应继续进行，拿出几天时间，必要时，停止工作帮助群众点种。以解决因参战所生之劳力困难，并克服某些群众靠天吃饭思想。杨主席更号召大家节约备荒。他回忆我区四三年灾荒严重期间，干部吃糠菜与群众同甘苦的精神，全体人员上下一致厉行节约渡过灾荒的艰苦事迹说：这方面大家的经验很深刻，今后应进一步执行中央局生产节约的号召，我们不仅做到机关困难机关解决，个人困难个人解决，决不增加财政开支；并且为了备荒还要节省食粮，各机关可进行每人每天节约二两米运动，由各机关自己保存起来，备万一之需。杨主席着重指出节约问题还应深入贯彻到下层去，特别是群众的节约尤属重要。对部分群众翻身后的浪费现象要教育克服之。本区的老百姓有深刻的灾荒痛苦经验，他们也会知道浪费一点，就要减少一点打蒋介石的力量。及时提出警惕灾荒，节约粮食，保证爱国自卫战争之军食也减少以后俄肚子，是很容易为广大群众所了解所接受的。杨主席最后勉励大家说：今年我们要保证前线供给，打胜仗，又要贯彻土地改革，还要开展大生产运动，任务很繁重，必须百倍奋发，咬紧牙关，艰苦努力，彻底克服任何蜕化思想，不要为军事进展而忘掉各种困难，特别是财经困难。一致面向困难，从长期着眼，才能克服困难、渡过困难。还要改进工作作风，紧张起来以战斗姿态完成光荣的任务！
