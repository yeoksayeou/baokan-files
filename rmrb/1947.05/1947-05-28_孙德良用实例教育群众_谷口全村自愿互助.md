[This report from our Taiyue office on the 26th] Sun Deliang of Gukou Village, Gaoping, led mutual aid, promoting the timely planting of 3,000 mu of grain in the entire village. Sun Deliang, the village's Farmers' Association chairman, used enlightenment and guidance to lead the masses in discussing how to overcome the difficulties of this year's spring plowing. The masses only said mutual aid was good, but no one wanted to participate. Deliang then took the lead in organizing a group, saying, "Whoever wants to join can join." The four volunteers were all old men in their fifties. The next day, the five of them went to the fields, repairing 25 mu of field edges, saving two workdays. When this achievement was announced, four boys and girls aged fourteen or fifteen wanted to join. The group members thought they were too young, but Deliang said, "We are exchanging labor of equal value, big or small." When they got to the fields, the adults plowed the land, and the children dug up the stubble. Each person averaged 1.5 mu per day. After three days, everyone said, "It's faster and more than doing it individually." As a result, nine more people joined, for a total of eighteen. At this time, Shen Xiangling, who was in his fifties, raised two pigs and also ground tofu, and he also wanted to join the mutual aid, but he couldn't go to the fields much. After discussion, the group bought two pigs and added them to the group. The money earned from grinding tofu was distributed among the members, and the mutual aid group planted his land for him. In this way, the entire village was gradually organized. Now eight groups have been organized, with 128 people participating.

[This report from our Jinnan office on the 26th] Dahu Village in the new district of Gaotang organized a spring plowing brigade to plow 364 mu of land. The brigade was led by the village chief, the director of the Farmers' Association, the brigade leader, and the group leaders. They planned to complete the plowing in three days, but completed it all in three half-days. After this collective labor, the masses deeply felt the power of organization, and all said that they would listen to the government's call in the future and follow Chairman Mao.

　　孙德良用实例教育群众
  　谷口全村自愿互助
    【本报太岳二十六日电】高平谷口村孙德良领导互助，推动全村三千亩谷物按时下种。孙德良是该村农会主席，用了启发诱导的办法领导群众讨论怎样克服今年春耕困难，群众只说互助好，但谁也不愿互助。德良便带头先组织了一组，说：“谁愿意谁就参加。”自愿报名的四人，都是五十多岁的老汉，第二天五人上地，修地边二十五亩，省下二个工，把这成绩一说，有四个十四、五岁的男女儿童要来参加，组员嫌小，德良说：“咱们是等价变工，大小一样变。”到了地，大人刨地，儿童掘茬子，一天每人平均一亩半，做三天后，大家说：“就是比个人做的又快又多”，因此又参加了九人，共十八人。这时有个申祥龄，五十多岁，喂猪两只，还磨豆腐，也愿入互助，但不能多去地，大家讨论结果，组内买猪两只入到里边，磨豆腐赚下钱大家分红，他的地由互助组给他种，这样慢慢就把全村都组织起来，现在已组织了八个组，有一百二十八人参加。
    【本报冀南二十六日电】高唐新区大胡集组织春耕大队翻地三百六十四亩。该大队由村长、农会主任、大队长、小组长参加领导，计划三天完成翻地工作，结果三晌即全部翻完。经过这次集体劳动，群众深感组织起来力量大，都说以后要听政府号召，跟着毛主席走。
