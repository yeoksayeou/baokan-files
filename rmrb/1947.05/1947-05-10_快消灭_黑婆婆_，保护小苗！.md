　　Quickly Eliminate "Black Grannies" and Protect the Seedlings!
　　Zhou Gang
　　Due to the lack of snow and rain last winter and this spring, pests are easily bred. Now a large number of "Black Grannies" have been found hiding in the soil in the Ping Shunzhi Chuan bottom, Dong Qingbei of the third district, and Jin Zhuang and Chong Xian areas of Hu Guan. According to the masses, their number exceeds historical records. The following are several pest control methods for your reference, hoping everyone will take action to capture them.
　　1.  Universally sow castor seeds with other seeds. (Some places call it castor bean) "Black Grannies" love to eat it most, but they die as soon as they eat it. In order to make the castor bean emerge from the soil at the same time as other crops, the white top of the castor bean must be removed during planting. If it is not removed, the emergence period will be slow and the time effect will be lost.
　　2.  In the evening, dig some small "pits" in the field and fill them with water. At night, the "Black Grannies" will concentrate in the ditch. Go and catch them the next day at dawn, and none will escape.
　　3.  Cut some elm branches and jujube branches, and place them sparsely in the field in the afternoon. "Black Grannies" will crawl onto them in piles. Take them out at dusk, throw them down and burn them.
　　4.  At dusk, many will fall on the trees. Spread a cloth sheet on the ground, shake the trees or stir the branches with a stick. "Black Grannies" will fall on the sheet, then gather them up and burn them.
　　5.  Organize children to catch them at the edge of the field and on the banks.
　　6.  "Black Grannies" are afraid of sunlight. They only come out in the morning and late in the evening, crawling under the leaves of the seedlings. Therefore, when catching them, look under the seedlings in the afternoon and morning.

　　快消灭“黑婆婆”，保护小苗！
    周刚
    由于去冬今春缺少雪雨，害虫容易滋生，现在三专平顺之川底、东青北、及壶关晋庄、崇贤一带发现了大批“黑婆婆”隐藏在土内。据群众说其数量之多超过历史。兹将几个除虫办法介绍如下，希望大家动手捕捉。
    １、下种时普遍带种大麻籽。（有的地方叫篦麻）“黑婆婆”最爱吃它，但一吃即死。为了使大麻和其它作物一齐出土，栽种时要除去大麻头上之白顶，如不除去出土期慢失去时效。
    ２、傍晚在地内，花花刨些小“圪道”灌水在内，夜里“黑婆婆”集中沟内，第二日天刚亮就去捉，一个都跑不掉。
    ３、垡些榆树枝，酸枣树枝，于下午花花放于地内，“黑婆婆”即一堆一堆的爬上去，到傍黑拿出，摔下烧掉。
    ４、傍黑时，树上落的很多，地下铺块布单子，把树摇动或用棍拌搅树枝，“黑婆婆”即跌在单子上，然后集中起烧掉。
    ５、组织儿童到地头岸边去捉。
    ６、“黑婆婆”怕太阳光，早上晚西才出来，爬在苗叶下边，因之捕捉时要在下午和早上苗下寻找。
