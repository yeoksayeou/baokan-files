Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 10th: The first stage of the Bohai Liberated Area's emergency repair project was successfully completed by the end of April. More than 500,000 workdays were used, mobilizing more than 70,000 civilian laborers, completing 521,716 cubic meters of earthwork, repairing more than 160 sections of embankments, using 518,554 catties of straw, 77,350 cubic meters of bricks and stones, and 20,780 wooden stakes. More than 20 dangerous sections were turned from danger to safety.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 10th: The Bohai District Administrative Office and the Provincial River Affairs Bureau jointly held an emergency meeting on the 29th of last month, attended by the county heads of eleven counties along the river and the deputy directors of the river management offices. The meeting lasted four days and decided that the key to Yellow River management and flood control was to repair dangerous sections, supplemented by restoring dikes. Governments at all levels established Yellow River Management Committees, and special districts established Frontline Support and Yellow River Management Committees to unify leadership in supporting the front and managing the Yellow River.

Xinhua News Agency, Ji-Lu-Yu, 8th: Chiang Kai-shek's planes and troops continue to attack employees restoring dikes along the river. At 3:00 PM on April 28th, one Chiang Kai-shek plane strafed the Zhangqiu Shentun ferry crossing, wounding one civilian crossing the river. On the same day, people in Dong'a were repairing the Fanpo dangerous section when they were also attacked by Chiang Kai-shek's planes, wounding three people. At 9:00 AM on April 29th, one Chiang Kai-shek plane dropped eight bombs and strafed for more than ten minutes at the Tao Chengpu dam head in Zhangqiu, sinking one ferry boat. On April 27th, more than 300 Chiang Kai-shek troops from Zhaogudui (under Kunshan) attacked emergency repair workers in a repair section, killing seven people.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 10th: The junctions of Zhangli and Jiyang in Bohai with Chiang Kai-shek occupied areas have not yet completed dike restoration and dangerous section repairs due to repeated sabotage by Chiang Kai-shek. In early April, when more than 400 people in Jiyang were repairing dangerous sections such as Shujia Shili Pu, more than 80 men from Chiang Kai-shek's special agent Qian Dekong and others surrounded the emergency repair masses, causing work to be suspended for half a month. When the people repaired again, they were bombed twice by Chiang Kai-shek's planes. This inhuman, despicable, and vicious behavior of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits is rarely seen in the world.

　　渤海抢险工程第一阶段完成
    多处险工转危为安
    【新华社山东十日电】渤海解放区自四月底止，抢险工程第一阶段胜利完成。共用人工五十万个以上，动员民夫七万余人，完成土方五二一七一六方，修补埝坝一百六十余段，用秸料五一八五五四斤，砖石七七三五○公方，木桩二○七八○根，二十余处险工转危为安。
    【新华社山东十日电】渤海区行署省河务局于上月二十九日联合召开沿河十一县县长及各治河办事处副主任紧急会议，历时四日，对治黄防汛问题决定以修险为主，复堤为副；各级政府成立治黄委员会，专员区成立支援前线及治黄委员会，支前治黄统一领导。
    【新华社冀鲁豫八日电】蒋机蒋军继续袭击沿河复堤员工，四月二十八日下午三时，蒋机一架窜至张秋沈屯渡口扫射，击伤过河民众一名。同日东阿民众抢修范坡险工，亦遭蒋机袭击，伤三人。二十九日上午九时，蒋机一架在张秋陶城铺坝头等地投弹八枚，扫射十余分钟，击沉渡船一只。四月二十七日，赵固堆（昆山属）蒋军三百余袭击修防段抢险员工，枪杀七人。
    【新华社山东十日电】渤海章历、济阳与蒋占区衔接处，因屡遭蒋介石破坏，复堤修险迄未完工。四月初济阳四百余人修舒家十里铺等险工时，蒋特钱德孔等部八十余人包围抢险群众，致半月未得复工。当人民再次抢修时，又遭蒋机两次轰袭。蒋贼此种毫无人性的卑劣毒辣行为，可谓人间罕见。
