　　Model Postal Workers

            Delivering mail, handing in machine guns, capturing Chiang's troops alive.
    Postal worker comrades at the front are both couriers and combatants. To complete their missions, they often have to pass through several lines of enemy blockade on a single postal route. Wei Nan postal workers Zhang Shutian, Wang Baotian, Guo Dongping, and Li Wenxiu once carried a large number of propaganda materials and twelve tubes of electricity to the command post. On the second day, they arrived at ×× village and encountered three enemies, so they shot at the enemy and chased them for more than two li. On the third day, they encountered special agents in Dinan and were shot at by the agents, but they were determined to find the command post and marched urgently all night. At dawn on the fourth day, they finally found the command post. Jiaxiang Bureau postal worker Peng Shengxiang was about to set off at dawn when a group of Chiang's troops ran from Juye. He cooperated with the Nanwang Brigade in two charges. They captured one enemy, seized one pistol and one rifle, and one hundred and eighty bullets, all of which were handed over to the troops. On March ×, Pingyao Station postal worker Guo Fuyi was about to cross the Tongpu Road to contact Jin Sui when he encountered an enemy patrol team on the railway who shot at him with a volley of fire. He cleverly used the terrain to lie down and threw a grenade. The enemy was thrown into chaos for a moment, and he took the opportunity to run across and successfully completed the task. Military Post Office postal workers Song Wenfa, Zuo Fengxian, Chen Jianping, and three other comrades were transporting documents on April 6th when they encountered the enemy midway in Fanzhuang, twenty li northwest of Qixian. They quickly rushed up and annihilated a group of enemies, capturing six enemies, seizing two light machine guns, one gun body, three 38-type rifles, and six hundred bullets, and returned safely after completing the task.
            Du Peizhen, Young and Bold
    Ningyang Bureau postal worker Du Peizhen is only fifteen years old this year. The special agents in the sixth and seventh districts of the county were very rampant that year, but he was not afraid at all and insisted on working. Once, he went to Feicheng to pick up contact, and his car and documents were robbed by special agents at Jieshou in the third district. He desperately entangled and fought with the special agents, and took the documents back, but the car was ridden away by the special agents. He chased and shouted, and the Jieshou militia heard the alarm and came to help, firing several shots. The special agents abandoned the car and fled. He happily thanked the militia, rode his car and sent the documents.
            Bao Honghai Endures Hardship and Sets an Example
    Bao Honghai is the squad leader of the postal worker team of the Juancheng Bureau. He is active in his work and endures hardship and is hardworking. Every time he delivers mail, he returns on the same day, a round trip of one hundred and ten li. If there is too much mail, he pushes it with a cart, regardless of whether it is dark or snowy. Even if his clothes are wet, he has to hurry to make time. He also feeds two livestock and hardly has any time to rest. Under his impetus, four people in the bureau (according to the establishment of nine people) are responsible for nine districts, ten administrative villages, and a trunk line of 360 li. Each person runs more than 90 li every day, and they also do some odd jobs when they return to the bureau. They truly do the work of more than two people, and no one has ever said that they are tired.

    陈彬
            送邮件、缴机枪、活捉蒋军。
    前方的邮工同志们，是交通员又是战斗员，他们为了完成任务，在一条邮线上，往往要通过敌人的好几道封锁线。卫南邮工张书田、王保田、郭东平、李文秀四人，一次捎了大批宣传品和十二筒电，往指挥部送。第二到了××村，遇上了三个敌人，他们便向敌射击，并追赶了二里多地。第三天在堤南碰上特务，被特务打了几枪，但他们抱着非找见指挥部不行的决心，连夜急行。第四天刚明，终于找见指挥部。嘉祥局邮工彭盛祥天刚明要出发，适巨野跑来一股蒋军，他便协同南旺大队冲锋二次，他们俘敌一名，缴匣枪步枪各一支、子弹一百八十粒，都交了部队。平遥站邮工郭富义在三月×日要冲过同蒲路与晋绥联系，在铁路上遇见了敌人的巡查队用排枪打他，他即机警的利用地形卧倒，甩了一颗手榴弹，敌人一时混乱，他即趁机飞跑越过，胜利地完成了任务。军邮局邮工宋文法、左凤仙、陈建平等三位同志，于四月六日往前运送文件，在淇县西北二十里之樊庄中途与敌遭遇，他们快速的冲上去，歼敌一股，俘敌六名、缴轻机枪二挺、枪身一个、三八式步枪三支、子弹六百发，完成任务后安然返回。
            杜培振年小胆大
    宁阳局邮工杜培振，今年才十五岁，去该年县六、七区特务很猖獗，但他毫不畏惧，坚持工作。一次，他去肥城取联系，在三区界首被特务抢了车子和文件，他拼命纠缠，和特务争夺，把文件夺回来了，但车子被特务骑跑了，他又一面追一面喊，界首民兵闻警赶来援助，打了数枪，特务弃车而逃，他高兴地谢了民兵，骑上车送了文件。
            鲍洪海吃苦耐劳起模范
    鲍洪海是鄄城局的邮工班长，工作积极吃苦耐劳，他每次送邮件，来回一百一十里当天即返回，邮件多了用小车推，不管黑夜下雪。甚至把衣服都湿透了也要赶路争取时间，他还喂着二头牲口，几乎没有休息时间。在他推动下，全局四个人（按编制九人）担负着九个区、十个行政村，一条干线共三百六十里长的路程，每天每人均跑着九十多里，返局时还要做些零星活，真正做到一个人顶两个多人，没有一个人说过累。
