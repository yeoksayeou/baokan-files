　　Wu'an and Ping Shun Intensify the Clearing of Public Property

　　[Report from this newspaper, Wu'an] Wu'an's districts and villages are clearing public property, rectifying finances, and increasing income. Comrade Li Fu of the Fourth District is particularly concerned about this, promoting it everywhere, which has played a significant role. Within ten days, many problems were discovered throughout the district, with a total of over 1,200 jin of millet, 770 jin of grain, and 500 jin of wheat being cleared out, and 700,000 yuan (currency) raised from the auction of public property. The Third District has now also established a public property rectification team to delve into various villages for clearing. The Eighth District has cleared out 5,000 jin of millet and five leather robes. County and district-level organizations are also investigating organizational materials and successively handing over illegal production funds and surplus profits. The Public Security Bureau handed over 1,000,000 yuan (currency) in shares, the Political Department handed over three mules, the Fourth District handed over two mules, the County General Affairs Section handed over 200,000 yuan (currency), the Second District handed over 400,000 yuan (currency), and the Fifth District handed over one mule. These materials have been directly handed over to the logistics headquarters to solve financial difficulties. The Commissioner's Office has given special commendation.

　　[Report from this newspaper, Ping Shun] Cadres and the masses in the Second District's villages have universally broken through ideological obstacles and are vigorously rectifying village administration. In the beginning, some village cadres had a fear of trouble, feeling that there was nothing in the village and no need to rectify. Others were afraid that the rectified property would be turned over to the public, increasing the burden, and were afraid of allocating it to other villages. Natural villages were unwilling to rectify in one place, preferring to rectify separately, fearing that they would suffer losses if they rectified together. To solve these problems, the first step was to explain that clearing not only would not increase the burden, but would also reduce it. As for the method, it could be carried out by natural village first, because this would facilitate clearing. After the problems were solved, the cadres' morale was high. According to preliminary statistics from three villages: When Yangshu Village began rectification, cadres and the masses all felt that there was nothing to rectify, but as a result, in addition to old opera costumes, props, and twenty-odd houses, they also rectified 26,400 jin of millet, enough for the entire village's public expenses for ten years. Tangli Village rectified over 4,700 jin of corn, over 3,000 jin of rice, over 2,500 yuan (currency) in shares, 36 jin of tin, and 25 jin of nitrate, among other things. Hanjia Village rectified over 13,000 jin of millet. Other villages are still actively rectifying. (Yun Zhong, Jian Xian)

　　武安·平顺加紧清理公产
    【本报武安讯】武安各区村清理公产，整顿财政，增加收入。四区李富同志对此特别关心，到处宣传，起了很大作用。全区十余天内发现问题很多，共计清理出小米一千二百余斤，谷子七百七十斤，麦子五百斤，拍卖公产款洋七十余万元。三区现在亦成立整理公产小组，分头深入各村清理。八区已清理出小米五千斤，皮袄五件。县区各机关亦清查机关物资，并陆续交出不合法的生产资金及余利。公安局交出股金洋一百万元，政治处交骡三头，四区交骡二头，县总务科交款洋二十余万元，二区交洋四十余万元，五区交骡子一头，这些资材均直接交后勤指挥部解决财政困难。专署并给以特别表扬。
    【本报平顺讯】二区各村干部群众普遍打破思想障碍，大力整顿村政。一开始有的村干部有怕麻烦思想，觉着村里没啥，不用整理。还有的整理出来怕归公，和加重负担，怕给别村拨。各自然村不愿往一处整理，愿各整理各的，怕整理到一处吃亏。解决这些问题首先是说明清理出来不只不加重负担，还可减轻负担，至于方法，可先以自然村为单位进行，因为这样便于清理。问题解决后干部情绪高涨，现在根据三个村的初步统计：杨树村开始整理时，干部群众都觉得没啥整理，结果除旧戏衣、行头和廿余间房子外，还整出小米二万六千四百斤，够全村全年公费十年用。棠黎村整理出玉茭四千七百余斤，米三千余斤，股金洋二千五百多元，锡三十六斤，硝二十五斤等多种。韩家村整出小米一万三千余斤。其余各村还正在积极整理中。（允中、见贤）
