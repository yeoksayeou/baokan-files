　　Sanitarium No. 1 Creates New Leadership Methods
    Launches Wounded Soldier Mutual Aid Movement
    [Our Newspaper] Sanitarium No. 1 used the mass line method to organize wounded and sick soldiers to help each other achieve merit, promoting the initiative of wounded comrades, and creating a method of wounded soldiers educating wounded soldiers. At the beginning of the movement, a merit group, which was the core of the recuperating personnel's mutual aid and merit campaign, was first established. This was conceived by these combat heroes in the hospital. Later, the branch carried out organizational work, proposing tasks, merit conditions, content, etc. The list of group members was proposed by each class and approved by the soldiers' meeting. After the merit group was established, it quickly discovered active elements among the convalescents; such as Kang Chun, Zheng Zhenhua, and Liu Tingbang, combat heroes from the 212th unit. In addition to being able to recuperate peacefully, they actively helped the severely wounded get food, assisted the lightly wounded to eat in the kitchen, explained hospital rules, promoted new treatments, and provided great help to the hospital's management work. This merit group also promoted a mass merit campaign. The 2nd Recuperation Team and the 3rd Recuperation Team launched a merit competition, proposing the following conditions: 1. No one will desert during treatment and return to the team; 2. Guarantee that one-third will be discharged and return to the team, and each will achieve a small merit; 3. Observe hospital rules and no fights or abuse will occur; 4. The food is well prepared and the wounded soldiers are satisfied. In order not to bury the merits, when convalescents return to the team, the merits are transferred together in the form of a letter of introduction or on the evaluation form. Secondly, among the working convalescents, a communications group was established, mainly composed of comrades with a little cultural foundation among the wounded soldiers. Using blackboard newspaper form to promote work, timely disseminating victory news and the model deeds of the wounded soldiers, which greatly encouraged the wounded soldiers. Zhang Wulai, the squad leader of the recuperation class, worked very actively, helping the wounded soldiers who were more severely injured than him to get food and boil water, clean the house, and bring stool and urine to the seriously injured. After being praised on the blackboard newspaper, he did not sleep all night, and got up before dawn to help the patients clean the ward. In addition, they also flexibly used various lively forms such as ditties and clapper talks to praise model comrades. In order to closely link the military and civilian relations, a civil affairs group was organized among the convalescents. Before each move, they first conducted investigations and compensations to ensure the return of borrowed items. When arriving at a new garrison, they first contacted the village cadres to establish close relations and conduct propaganda to the village. Therefore, they also received the village's condolences and help. Model convalescent Comrade Zhang Wulai often supplied three local families with water and helped them grind grain. The villagers reflected, "Comrade Zhang Wulai is really good, we can't bear to see you go!" There are many comrades like this who love the people. Convalescents with better injuries also formed a condolence group. They lived in the center of the street, and whenever they heard that wounded soldiers were coming, they would carry lanterns in the middle of the night to help the wounded soldiers down, arrange for them to eat and sleep, and then talk about hospital rules and the benefits of new treatments. They also often went to the wards to publicize victory news and explain problems to comfort the wounded soldiers. This organization became a bridge between the hospital and the convalescents, greatly strengthening the connection between the hospital and the convalescents. The wounded soldiers also organized their own economic committee to improve their lives; a small summary every five days, a major settlement every ten days, and public announcement of accounts; carrying out life adjustments within the limits of the supply system, ensuring that the meals are not the same for ten days, and eating half a catty of meat every other day. The enthusiasm of the wounded comrades was aroused, and they limped (Note: The hospital should take care of the wounded and not affect their recuperation) to buy cheap vegetables and dredge them back from dozens of miles away to improve everyone's life.

　　封院一所创用新领导方法
    开展伤员互助运动
    【本报讯】封院一所，运用群众路线方法，组织伤病员互助立功，发扬了伤员同志的积极性，创造了伤员教育伤员的方法。运动开始，首先建立了休养人员互助立功运动核心的立功组，这是由这些战斗英雄们在医院中酝酿起来的，以后支部又进行了组织工作提出任务、立功条件、内容等。组员的名单是由各班提出来经军人大会通过的。立功组成立后，很快发现了休养员中的积极分子；如二一二部战斗英雄康春、郑振华、刘廷邦，除自己能安心休养外，并积极的帮助重彩号打饭菜，扶轻彩号到火房吃饭，并且解释院规，宣传新疗法，给医院管理工作上很大的帮助。这种立功组同时又推动了群众性的立功运动，休二队与休三队间，展开了立功竞赛，提出的条件是：一、在医疗和归队中间没有一个开小差的；二、保证三分之一出院归队，并每人立一小功；三、遵守院规不发生打骂人的现象；四、饭菜作得好，伤员都满意。为了不使功绩埋没，休养员归队时，用介绍信方式或在鉴定表上把功绩一起转走。其次是在工休人员中，主要是伤员同志中稍有文化基础的同志建立通讯组，运用黑板报形式推动工作，及时传播胜利消息与伤员的模范事迹，对伤员的鼓舞作用很大。休养员张五来班长，工作非常积极，帮助比他伤重的彩号打饭烧水，打扫房子，给重伤员端屎尿。在黑板报上受表扬后，他一夜没睡着，天不明便起来帮助病人打扫病室去了。此外，他们还灵活的利用各种活泼的形式如小调、快板等来赞扬模范同志。为密切军民关系休养员中组织民运小组，每次移动前，先进行调查、赔偿，保证借物归还。到新驻地先和村干接洽，密切关系和对村里进行宣传。因而也就得到村里的慰问与帮助。模范休养员张五来同志经常供三家老乡吃水、推碾。老乡反映说：“张五来同志真好，可舍不得你走！”像这样爱民的同志还很多。伤较好的休养员并组成慰问组，他们住在街中心，一听到有彩号来，半夜也提着灯把彩号扶下来，安置吃饭、睡觉，然后讲些院规，讲新疗法的好处，还经常到病房里，宣传胜利消息，解释问题给伤员以安慰。这一组织成为医院与休养人员的桥梁，大大密切了院方与休养人员的联系。伤员并自己组织经委会，改善生活；五天小结，十天大结算，公布帐目；在不超过供给制度内进行生活上的调剂，做到十天饭菜不重样，隔天吃半斤肉，伤员同志积极性发扬起来了，拐着腿（按：所方要照顾伤号，不要影响到休养）到几十里外买回便宜菜疏回来改善大家生活。
