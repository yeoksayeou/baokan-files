Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 14th: The masses in Leipingta and Lijia Gou in Ansai County, Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, have fully utilized their high level of intelligence during wartime, creating a method of mutual aid and labor exchange between large rivers and small gullies, as well as a way for local residents and immigrants from enemy-occupied areas to unite in production. Ma Qimin and his brother in Leipingta had four oxen. When the enemy invaded Donggoumen, his brother went to the front line to carry the wounded, leaving two oxen idle at home. At that time, blacksmiths Lei Guangrui and Gao Qingchun from Zhenwudong happened to have moved to Xiaogou to avoid the enemy. Ma Qimin immediately engaged in labor exchange with them, ensuring that neither people nor oxen were idle, plowing 15 mu of land for the Ma family in nine days. After the enemy retreated, Ma Qimin drove the four oxen to Zhenwudong to return the labor for three days, plowing five mu of land for the Lei and Gao families, enabling timely planting of cotton and miscellaneous grains. In addition, Gao Shanying, a resident from the enemy-occupied area of Yan'an, moved to Lijia Gou, lacking food and clothing. The villagers jointly collected one dan of grain and lent it to Gao Shanying without interest, and also allocated five mu of riverside land, providing oxen and seeds for joint cultivation, stipulating that the grain be returned after the autumn harvest. This enabled Gao Shanying to concentrate on production and reclaim wasteland to rebuild his home.

　　陕北安塞新创造
    小川大沟互助变工  战时仍能按时下种
    【新华社西北十四日电】陕甘宁边区安塞县雷平塌、李家沟群众，在战时充分发挥高度智慧，创造出大川与小沟互助变工。本地居民与敌占区移民团结生产的办法。雷平塌、马起民兄弟，有牛四头，敌人窜犯东沟门时，其弟到前线抬运伤兵，家中两牛闲着。当时真武洞铁匠雷光瑞、高庆春恰巧移至小沟避敌，马起明即与他二人进行人牛变工，使得人牛不闲，九天给马家耕十地五垧。敌人退走后，马起明赶四头牛至真武洞还工三天，给雷、高两家耕地五垧，使得棉花杂粮得以按时下种。另有延安敌占区居民高善英移至李家沟，缺吃少穿，该村居民即共同凑集谷米一石，无利借给高善英，并调剂五垧川地，供给牛力、种籽，进行伙种，规定秋收后还粮。使得高善英能够安心生产，并增开荒地重建家务。
