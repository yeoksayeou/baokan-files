　　Pingshun Beishe Village Launches Emergency Planting After Rain
    [This newspaper's Pingshun dispatch] After rain on May 1st, Beishe Village in the Fifth District launched an emergency planting campaign, organizing all able-bodied, semi-able-bodied, and auxiliary laborers (including primary school students). After four days of concentrated effort, they planted 577 mu of cotton, exceeding the plan by 150 mu. Active members such as Cao Xiaogou and Wang Baoze (labor heroes), totaling 27 people, received rewards for their excellent performance in cotton planting. Now everyone has set out a plan: Starting from the 5th, they will complete the sowing of 575 mu of "Golden Queen" seeds in four days. (Chun He, Yongming, Zhenhua)
    [Another dispatch] Cui Fubao, labor hero of the Seventh District's Anyang, starting from the 29th day of the lunar calendar, led his group as a role model and launched an emergency sowing campaign. The group consisted of eight able-bodied and semi-able-bodied men, twelve able-bodied and semi-able-bodied women, and one auxiliary laborer. They sowed 40 mu of grain in one day, working from dawn till dusk with great enthusiasm. This influenced three large teams and thirteen groups throughout the village. Currently, there are 73 laborers (excluding those participating in the war), 151 able-bodied and semi-able-bodied men and women, all participating in the emergency sowing campaign. In a total of three days, they have already planted 520 mu of grain and over 20 mu of corn. They now plan to plant another 610 mu of corn, to be completed within seven days.
