Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, May 18th -- TASS, New York: According to reports, Wallace delivered a speech at a mass meeting of 20,000 people in Chicago on May 14th, hosted by "American Progressive Citizens." In his speech, he again condemned American foreign policy and urged the adoption of a fifteen-billion-dollar ten-year world reconstruction plan. He emphasized that his reconstruction plan considered extensive assistance to the Soviet Union, saying, "We must protest Dulles' (Secretary of State Marshall's Republican advisor at the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference) erroneous assertion that the Soviet Union caused the failure of the Moscow meeting." He declared that the so-called Truman Doctrine is "the doctrine of unlimited assistance to all anti-Soviet governments." Wallace predicted that "one day we will bitterly regret the actions taken by Congress" - regarding the Turkish-Greek aid bill. Wallace said, "The Truman Doctrine may not lead to war, but it can never lead to peace... In all of Europe, I have only seen one group - the extreme right-wing group led by Churchill - that is prepared to uphold the Truman Doctrine." Wallace condemned Truman's administration for "playing politics with the disasters of Europe" by giving aid to France on the condition that the French government "continue without the support of the French Communist Party." This policy not only insulted France, but also "will lead to disaster." Wallace quoted Assistant Secretary of State Clayton's assertion, as reported in newspapers, that the United States should continue to control exports and prevent Eastern European countries from obtaining American food and reconstruction materials, saying that if this is true, "it is a most cruel war - a war against the needs of the people. I regard this proposition as the most severe form of the Truman Doctrine." Other speakers at the conference included Thomas, Vice President of the United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America, radio commentator Walsh, and the famous black singer Paul Robeson. Thomas said at the conference: "There is a similar ominous sign between the activities of the reactionaries in this country and the activities of the former Third Reich Nazi leaders. Behind those proposals to provide financial and military support to various reactionary governments, behind the proposals to deprive every person and doctrine that does not bear the reactionary trademark of the National Association of Manufacturers (Note: i.e., the reactionary organization of American capitalists) of legal protection, there is a shadow of violence, already armed and ready to act. We are facing a crisis caused by reactionary industrialists and their political lackeys, who deliberately ignore our urgent economic and social needs, and instead launch a large-scale attack on our basic civil rights as a prelude to their plan to dominate the world."

　　芝加哥两万群众大会
    反对杜鲁门主义
    华莱士、汤麦斯等发表演说
    【新华社陕北十八日电】塔斯社纽约讯：报载：华莱士于五月十四日在芝加哥“美国进步公民”所主持之两万人群众大会上发表演说。在演讲中他再度谴责美国外交政策，并力促采取一千五百亿元之十年世界重建计划。他强调他的重建计划中考虑广泛的帮助苏联时说：“我们必须抗议杜勒斯（国务卿马歇尔在莫斯科外长会议中的共和党顾问）说苏联招致了莫斯科会议失败的错误断言。”他宣称：所谓杜鲁门主义就是“无限制的帮助各个反苏维埃政府的主义”。华莱士预言“总有一天我们将痛苦的悔恨国会所采取的行动”——对于土希法案。华莱士说：“杜鲁门主义或许不会引向战争，但是它却永远不能引向和平……。在全欧洲我仅只见过一个集团——由邱吉尔领导的极端右翼的集团——他们准备维护杜鲁门主义。”华莱士谴责杜鲁门的施政说，它“用欧洲的灾祸去玩弄政治”，在法国政府“不要法国共产党支持而继续下去”的条件下给法国帮助。这个政策不仅侮辱了法国，而且“它将引向灾难”。华氏摘引报纸所载助理国务卿亚泽逊主张美国继续管制输出，不使东欧各国获得美国的粮食及复建物资时称：如果这是真的，“它就是一种最残酷的战争——反对各国人民之需要的战争。我把这个主张看作杜鲁门主义的最严酷的方式。”在大会中的另外一些演讲者有汽车工人产业职工联合会副主席汤麦斯、无线电评论员华尔施、著名黑人歌唱家保罗·罗宾逊等多人。汤麦斯在大会上称：“在这个国家里的反动派的活动与前第三帝国纳粹头子们的活动之间有着相似的恶兆。在那些以财政及军事支持各个反动政府的提议后面，在要剥夺每一个没有贴上美国制造业协会（按：即美国资本家的反动组织）反动商标的人和主义之法律保障的提议后面存在着暴力的阴影，已经武装起来而且准备开始行动了。我们面临着反动的工业家及其政治走狗们所造成的危机，他们故意不认识我们经济上及社会上的迫切需要，而代之以开始在广大范围内大规模地进攻我们的基本公民权利，以作为他们统治全世界之计划的前奏”。
