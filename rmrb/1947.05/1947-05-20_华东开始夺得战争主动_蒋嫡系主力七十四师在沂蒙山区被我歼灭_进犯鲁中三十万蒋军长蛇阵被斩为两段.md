　　Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, urgent dispatch on the 18th: The People's Liberation Army, under the command of Generals Chen Yi, Su Yu, and Tan Zhenlin, in one fell swoop annihilated the entire three brigades of Zhang Lingfu's 74th Division, Chiang Kai-shek's elite main force, and the entire 57th Regiment of the 19th Brigade of the 83rd Division at Menglianggu in the Yimeng Mountains. This marked the beginning of seizing the war initiative and swiftly bisected the 300,000 Chiang troops advancing on the Central Shandong Liberated Area in a single file, long snake formation. The battle is still developing victoriously. Headquarters of the East China People's Liberation Army, Communique No. 17, stated: After the start of the second campaign of our army's summer offensive, on May 13th, we launched a counterattack against Chiang's elite main force, the 74th Division, in the southern mountainous area of Tanbu (52 li northeast of Mengyin). On the same day, the Chiang troops fled in disarray. Our army relentlessly pursued and annihilated them, compressing and encircling them in the mountains of Menglianggu—55 li southeast of Mengyin, east side of the Lin (Yi) Meng (Yin) highway—by the morning of the 14th. Our army launched a general offensive in the afternoon of the 15th, and after fierce fighting until noon on the 16th, completely resolved the battle. At the same time, we defeated several reinforcements from five divisions of the enemy: the 25th, 65th, 83rd, 7th, and 48th Divisions. The 74th Division headquarters and all of its three brigades, the 51st, 57th, and 58th, as well as the entire 57th Regiment of the 19th Brigade of the 83rd Division, were completely and thoroughly annihilated. Detailed battle results are being tallied. Thus far, Chiang Kai-shek and Chen Cheng's "key offensive" strategy in Shandong has suffered continuous heavy blows from the iron fists of the People's Liberation Army and has begun to fail. Note: The 74th Division advanced north in three routes from Duozhuang (56 li southeast of Mengyin on the Linmeng Highway), Antibei (50 li southeast of Mengyin) and other places on May 11, attempting to attack Yishui, but was completely annihilated.

　　Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, dispatch on the 18th: Introduction to Chiang's 74th Division: The 74th Division is one of Chiang Kai-shek's five elite main forces and also one of the main forces of the Chiang troops on the East China battlefield, known as the "Model Army," directly under the Chiang Army Headquarters. It had received special training from the U.S. Military Advisory Group, was entirely equipped with American light weapons, and partially re-equipped with "National Weapons" in March of this year. Chiang Kai-shek had repeatedly given it "awards."

　　Before reorganization, the division was the 74th Army, originally commanded by Wang Yaowu, under the jurisdiction of the 36th Group Army of the Fourth War Area. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, it was stationed in Nanjing as a guard force, comprising the 51st, 57th, and 58th Divisions. Its main force, the 58th Division, was originally commanded by Yu Jishi, Chiang Kai-shek's nephew. At the beginning of the War of Resistance, Yu was transferred elsewhere, and Feng Shengfa and Liao Lingqi successively took over as division commander. In November 1941, Zhang Lingfu succeeded them. In December 1944, after the Battle of Changde, Wang Yaowu was transferred, and Shi Zhongcheng took over as army commander, with Zhang Lingfu as his deputy. Before the Japanese surrender, the entire army was re-equipped with American weapons. After the Japanese surrender, it was transported by water from Changsha and Hankou to the Nanjing, Zhenjiang, and Pukou areas, serving as the Nanjing garrison force of the Chiang Army Headquarters. When Chiang's senior military officers gathered in Nanjing, Chiang Kai-shek designated this unit as a model unit at the meeting, ordering all Chiang Army units to use this unit as the standard for all training and education, praising it as the "Model Army."

　　After reorganization, the army was renamed a division, and the divisions were renamed brigades. The division was commanded by Li Yannian, deputy director of Chiang's Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters, and advanced towards the Liberated Area of Northern Jiangsu. Before suffering a head-on blow from the East China People's Liberation Army, it successively invaded and occupied Suqian, Siyang, Huaiyin, Huaian, Baoying and other cities, boastfully and "majestically" for a time. Although it had lost more than 3,000 officers and soldiers (including two regimental commanders and six battalion commanders), Chiang Kai-shek, a lackey and a fool who only knew how to seize territory and would rather carry burdens, still greatly rewarded Zhang Lingfu. From October 19 to November 1, in the famous 14-day and night Battle of Lian Shui defense, the division and the 192nd Brigade of the 28th Division jointly annihilated more than 9,000 enemy troops and were forced to retreat and reorganize. The 74th Division, having its head clouded, finally learned some useful lessons. From then on, it dodged and hid, dared not rush headlong, and adopted so-called "steady progress." On December 16, the Liberation Army actively withdrew, and the 74th Division finally occupied Lian Shui. On January 10 this year, it occupied Muyang city again, passed through Xin'anzhen, invaded Tancheng on February 1, invaded Linyi city on the 15th, attempting a "military showdown" with the Liberation Army in Southern Shandong, but unexpectedly found nothing. By the end of March, the division and the 83rd Division jointly advanced along the Lin (Yi) Zi (Yang) Highway, occupied Feixian city on the 27th, and harassed the mountainous areas of Southern Shandong. In mid-April, when Chiang Kai-shek concentrated thirteen reorganized divisions to invade the Central Shandong Liberated Area in five routes, the 74th Division occupied Mengyin city on the 28th. Recently, under the direct command of the First Army Corps, Tang Enbo, the division and the 25th, 65th, 83rd, 7th, and 48th Divisions advanced toward Yishui and Juxian. In the face of the powerful People's Liberation Army, the division was finally completely annihilated.

　　Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, dispatch on the 18th: Introduction to the 57th Regiment of the 19th Brigade of the 83rd Division of Chiang's Army: The 83rd Division was originally Wang Yaowu's unit, with Li Tianxia as the division commander. Before reorganization, it was the 100th Army. After its annihilation in the Yijiabao battle in Taixing from July 13 to 15 last year, it was restored and rebuilt with supplements from the Chiang Provincial Security Regiment. The 57th Regiment was completely annihilated during the attack on Yancheng and Wuyou in early December, and the regimental commander, Zhong Xiongfei, was also captured alive. After being reorganized, this time the regiment was annihilated for the third time.

　　华东开始夺得战争主动
    蒋嫡系主力七十四师
    在沂蒙山区被我歼灭
    进犯鲁中三十万蒋军长蛇阵被斩为两段            
    【新华社华东前线十八日急电】陈毅、粟裕、谭震林诸将军麾下人民解放军，在沂蒙山区孟良崮一举歼灭蒋介石嫡系精锐主力七十四师张灵甫部三个旅全部，及八十三师十九旅五十七团全部，开始夺得战争主动权，将进犯鲁中解放区之三十万蒋军一字长蛇阵迅速腰斩为两段，战事犹在胜利发展中。华东人民解放军总部第十七号公报称：我军夏季攻势第二个战役开始后，首于五月十三日在坦埠（蒙阴东北五十二里）南山区向蒋嫡系主力军七十四师举行反击，当日蒋军即狼狈败逃。我军以勇猛行动跟踪追歼，至十四日晨，将其压缩包围于孟良崮——蒙阴东南五十五里，临（沂）蒙（阴）公路东侧——大山中。我军于十五日午后发动总攻，激战至十六日午时，完全解决战斗。同时打垮敌二十五、六十五、八十三、七、四十八等五个师的数次增援，彻底干脆歼灭七十四师师部及其五十一、五十七、五十八三个旅全部，暨八十三师十九旅五十七团全部，详细战果正清查中。至此，蒋介石、陈诚在山东之“重点攻势”战略，遭受人民解放军铁拳接连痛击，已开始破产。按：七十四师于五月十一日自垛庄（蒙阴东南五十六里临蒙公路上）、岸堤（蒙阴东南五十里）等地三路北犯坦埠，企图转犯沂水而遭全军覆灭。
    【新华社华东前线十八日电】蒋军七十四师介绍：七十四师为蒋介石嫡系五大精锐主力之一，亦为华东战场蒋军主力之一，号称“模范军”，直属蒋记陆军总部。曾受美军事顾问团特种训练，全部美械轻装，今年三月间部分改换“国械”。蒋介石曾多次予以“嘉奖”。
    该师整编前为七十四军，原军长王耀武，属第四方面军三十六集团军统辖。抗战前驻防南京，充作警卫部队，下辖五十一、五十七、五十八等三个师。其主力五十八师，原师长为蒋介石外甥俞济时，抗战开始，俞他调，曾有冯圣法、廖令奇先后接任该师师长。一九四一年十一月，由张灵甫继任。四四年十二月，常德会战后，王耀武调开，由施忠诚接任军长，张灵甫副之。日寇投降前，该军全部改为美械装备；日寇投降后，中长沙、汉口水运南京、镇江、浦口一带，为蒋记陆军总部之南京卫戍部队。蒋军高级将领于南京集会时，蒋介石在会上指定该部为典型部队，命令蒋军各部队一切训练教育以该部为标准，誉之为“模范军”。
    该部后经整编，军改称师，师改旅，该师由蒋记徐州绥靖公署副主任李延年指挥，向苏北解放区进犯。在遭受华东人民解放军迎头痛击前，先后侵陷宿迁、泗阳、淮阴、淮安、宝应等城，扬扬得意，“威武”一时。虽曾丧失官兵三千余（包括两个团长，六个营长），但只知抢地方、宁愿背包袱的奴才加蠢才的蒋介石，仍对张灵甫备予嘉奖。十月十九日至十一月一日，有名的十四昼夜涟水保卫战役，该师与二十八师一九二旅共就歼九千余名，被迫退却整顿。被冲昏了头脑的七十四师，总算获得了若干有益教训。从此躲躲闪闪，不敢横冲直撞，采取所谓“稳步前进”。十二月十六日，解放军主动撤出，涟水城始为该师占领。今年一月十日，又占领沐阳城，后经新安镇，于二月一日侵入郯城，十五日侵入临沂城，企图与解放军在鲁南“武力决赛”，却不料扑了几个空。至三月下旬，该师与八十三师共同沿临（沂）滋（阳）公路进犯，二十七日侵占费县城，并向鲁南山区侵扰。四月中旬，蒋介石集中十三个整编师五路进犯鲁中解放区时，七十四师于二十八日侵占蒙阴城。最近由第一兵团汤恩伯直接指挥该师及二十五、六十五、八十三、七、四十八等六个师，又向沂水、莒县进犯，在强大的人民解放军面前，该师终被全部歼灭。
    【新华社华东前线十八日电】蒋军八十三师十九旅五十七团介绍：八十三师原为王耀武部，师长李天霞，整编前为第一百军。其十九旅于去年七月十三日至十五日泰兴宜家堡战役中就歼后，由蒋记省保安团补充恢复建制。五十七团于十二月初旬进攻盐城、伍佑，全部就歼，团长钟雄飞亦被生擒，后又经整装；此次该团乃第三次被歼。
