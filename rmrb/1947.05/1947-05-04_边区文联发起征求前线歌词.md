　　Border Region Federation of Literary and Art Circles Launches Solicitation of Lyrics for the Front Lines

    In order to meet the general needs of soldiers at the front, the Border Region Federation of Literary and Art Circles has launched a solicitation of lyrics for the front lines, the methods are as follows:
    I. Content: Any theme related to the front line is welcome, such as marches for the Field Army, merit campaigns, army-civilian relations, respect for cadres and love for soldiers, mutual assistance, as well as joining the army, supporting the army, giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers and revolutionary martyrs, and supporting the front line.
    II. Lyrics can be submitted separately. The musical rhythm should be powerful and suitable for chorus.
    III. Once a manuscript is adopted, the Federation of Literary and Art Circles will first pay the lyricist a fee of 150-500 yuan, and the composer 200-600 yuan per piece. A complete song (including lyrics) will receive 350-1000 yuan. The author will still receive royalties when it is published. If it is popular at the front and well-received, once the front line reflects this, additional bonuses will be awarded to encourage creativity!
    In addition, musicians can register by writing to us immediately. After receiving the lyrics, the Federation of Literary and Art Circles will mimeograph and distribute them for musical composition.
