Saving Labor to Support the Frontlines
	Military Families in Yuancun and Other Places Farm Their Own Land
[This newspaper Changzhi News] On the 23rd of last month, Yuancun in the Second District held a meeting of retired veterans and military families. Under the conscious demand to support the frontlines and reduce the burden on the people, military families and retired veterans requested to decline substitute farming. You Tang's mother, a military family member, said, "I don't need the people's help; I have people and livestock." Others also proposed canceling substitute farming. A total of 27 households registered to cancel substitute farming, accounting for 499.4 mu of land. Only seven households needed full assistance, accounting for 92.5 mu of land; ten households requested half-substitute farming for 59.5 mu of land. Regiment Commander Ma's wife said, "Regiment Commander Ma wrote to me and asked me to be self-reliant. I spin and weave every day to earn money to live on, and I even carry water when I'm busy." Yi Wang said, "This is very reasonable. In the past, some military families had young people but only worked 10 mu of land, while Old Chen, an old man, farmed 16 mu himself and still had to receive preferential treatment." Ju Wang said, "We can't be too much better off than the ordinary people. The ordinary people lose too much work time and are not satisfied. It's enough to be supported by the masses in the village." After everyone discussed it, they were all happy, and the village cadres were also happy. The next day, they led the substitute farming of 152 mu, ensuring that the substitute farming would be completed within two days, which made the military families and cadres feel satisfied.

[This newspaper News] On the evening of the 22nd of last month, West Street in Heshi Town, Third District of Lucheng, held a mass meeting of the whole street to discuss preferential treatment for military personnel. First, Village Deputy Wang Ruanhai said, "Our preferential treatment work this year is different from previous years. Troops are enlisting one batch after another, and more are leaving to participate in the war, the labor force is actually decreasing, so we must pay more attention to farming the land well and not let an acre of land go to waste, especially we must first help military families and those participating in the war to farm their land well." Before he finished speaking, Wang Linfu, a military family member, said, "I am a military family member, and my family has more than 30 mu of land and feeds a cow. My eldest son has joined the army, and there is still a second child at home. Although I am over 50 years old, I can still be used as a full laborer. My family's land does not need the village to farm for me. My wife spins and weaves at home, and besides using it ourselves, we can also sell it, and we also guarantee to achieve 'cultivating three and saving one'." Then, Li Jitao, Li Chunming, and others also voluntarily requested to cancel substitute farming. The masses were very moved by this situation. Some suggested that although this method is good, those who have difficulties should still be helped as much as possible. After the meeting, various mutual aid groups formulated plans to ensure that they would help military families with planting first. (Ming Bo, Wang Jian, Li Yong, Yun Cheng)

　　节省劳力支援前线
    原村等地军属自耕自种
    【本报长治讯】二区原村于上月廿三日，召开荣退军人和军属会议，在支援前线减轻民力负担的自觉要求下，军属荣退军人纷纷要求谢绝代耕。军属有堂的娘说：“我不用老百姓帮助，有人也有牲口。”其他人亦纷纷提出取消代耕的意见。先后报名取消代耕的共廿七户，地四百九十九亩四分。没劳力要全帮助的只有七户，地九十二亩半；把地请求半代耕的有十户，地五十九亩半。马团长老婆说：“马团长写来信要我自力更生，我每天纺花织布，赚钱过活，在忙时我还担水。”一旺说：“这一办可合理了。过去军属家有的有青年人，才做十亩地，老陈是个老汉，自种十六亩地，还要优抗。”聚旺说：“咱不能比老百姓太高了，老百姓误工太多，也不满意，在村上得到群众拥护就行啦。”经过大家讨论，都很高兴，村干部也高兴。第二天就领导代耕一百五十二亩，代耕地保证在两天内完成，军属干部都觉得满意。

    【本报讯】潞城三区合室镇西街于上月二十二日晚召开全街群众大会，讨论优军工作，首先由村副王软孩说：“咱们今年优抗工作和往年不同，参军一批一批的走，再加上参战也走，劳力事实上是要少，地就更要多注意种好，不能荒了一亩地，特别要先好好帮助军属和参战的把地种好。”他的话还没落音，便有军属王林福说：“我是个军属，我家种有三十来亩地，喂着一头牛，老大参军走了，还有个二孩在家里，我虽五十多岁啦，但还能顶全劳力用。我家的地不用村上给我代耕，我老婆在家里纺花织布，除我家用了还能卖，还保证达到耕三余一。”接着又有李吉太、李春明等自动请求取消代耕。群众在这种情况下，甚为感动，有的提出虽然这种办法好，但对于有困难的还是要尽力帮助，会后各互助组纷纷订出计划保证尽先帮助军属下种。（明波、王建、李勇、云程）
