    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th] TASS, London Dispatch (delayed): The Spanish News Agency recently reported detailed information about the workers' strike that broke out in Bilbao, northern Spain, on May 1st, emphasizing that the resistance movement encouraged the workers of Bilbao, with 75 percent of the industrial workers in the city and its vicinity participating in the strike. The dispatch stated: At noon on May 1st, the Civil Governor demanded that the striking workers return to work, but the workers refused. The Civil Governor announced the abolition of collective labor contracts and declared that before employment was permitted, new employers must check that workers held work permits from May 1st. On May 8th, the authorities retaliated against 14,000 workers, with 6,000 workers arrested and sent to prisons, which were already overcrowded. Many workers were held in bullrings. The clandestine trade union federation ordered a general strike on May 5th, and immediately 25,000 workers left the factories. The next day, 7,000 construction workers and transportation workers also went on strike. On May 7th, 5,000 bakers and more transportation workers joined the strike. Police and Fascist party members began to commit atrocities, and arrests are increasing.
