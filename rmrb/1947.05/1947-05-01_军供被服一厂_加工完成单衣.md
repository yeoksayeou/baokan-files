　　Military Supply Clothing Factory No. 1
    Completes Production of Single-Layer Clothing
    [This Newspaper's Report] The First Clothing Factory of the Military Region Supply Department, inspired by the slogan "Production is going to the battlefield, making more single-layer clothing to defeat Chiang Kai-shek," has launched a factory-wide competition craze. Comrade Zhou Jingzhong increased his daily output from thirty to fifty pieces on one machine; Comrade Liu Haishun worked even harder, making fifty-five pieces a day, setting a new record for the machine group. Comrade Huo Yuncai, who sews sleeves by hand, used his ability to sew one hundred and eighty pieces a day, exceeding the merit standard by twenty percent. Comrade Shi Guangrong of the cutting room cut from one hundred and forty pieces to one hundred and eighty pieces, Comrade Hu Xiaoliu put in extra effort, cutting two hundred pieces a day, and Shen Tianwang, the leader of the cutting group, worked even harder, cutting two hundred and thirty pieces a day. Comrade Tian Qilian, who is seven months pregnant, buttonholed eight hundred and forty pieces in March, setting a factory record. The dye house has been getting up to work in the middle of the night for more than a month. In the tense competition for merit, the slogan "Welcome May Day, Red Flag Recognition" was put forward. Comrade Xu Xiaofang said: "I am determined to get on the red flag, I will not rest even if my eyes hurt, I must earn merit." Before dawn, the sound of machines roared in the workshop, and after putting down their rice bowls, they climbed onto the machines, as tense as on the battlefield. Through the efforts of all the factory's workers, the original 90-day production task was completed in 53 days. (Ge Qin)
