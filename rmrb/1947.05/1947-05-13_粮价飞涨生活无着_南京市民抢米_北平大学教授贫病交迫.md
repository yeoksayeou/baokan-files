Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th: Shanghai News: The rice-snatching turmoil has spread to Nanjing, where the Chiang government is located, and Pukou, an important town across the river. In Nanjing, over a hundred people, due to soaring grain prices and destitution, smashed four rice shops; police intervened and arrested seventeen people, and the situation is seriously escalating. Pukou is suffering from a grain shortage, and on the 8th of this month, the price of rice nearly doubled within a few hours. Over two thousand hungry railway employees smashed all nine rice shops in the town, and troops and military police rushed to suppress them, opening fire. The town has now been placed under martial law. Furthermore, most rice shops in Shanghai remained closed on the 9th.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th: According to the Central News Agency: The economic crisis in the Chiang-controlled areas has forced Peking University, known as the highest institution of learning in Beiping, to be unable to maintain itself. Professors are unable to teach, and the school's 180-plus professors have overdrafted their salaries to the tune of 400 million yuan. The largest overdraft is over 6 million yuan, and will reach 10 million yuan next month. The school is already in debt to the tune of 600 million yuan, and the monthly interest payment is 50 million yuan, while the school's regular expenses are only 34 million yuan per month, which is not enough to cover the interest. Professors such as Shen Congwen are currently in a state of poverty and illness. Other schools such as Tsinghua University and Teachers College are in similar situations.

    【新华社陕北十一日电】上海消息：抢米风潮已扩展至蒋政府所在地之南京与隔江重镇浦口。南京一百余人以粮价飞涨，生活无着，捣毁四个米店；警察出动干涉，逮捕十七人，事态正严重扩大中。浦口粮食缺乏，本月八日米价几点钟内约涨两倍，铁路饥馑员工两千余人，捣毁了城内所有的九个米店，军队宪兵驰往镇压，并开枪射击，该镇现已宣布戒严。又上海大部米店九日仍未复业。
    【新华社陕北九日电】据中央社透露：蒋区经济危机已迫使北平号称最高学府之北京大学也无法维持。教授无法教书，该校教授一百八十余人，透支薪津已达四亿元。其中透支最多者为六百余万元，下月即达千万元。该校已负债六亿，每月付息即需五千万元，而全校经常费每月仅三千四百万元，尚不敷付息之数，该校教授沈从文等现正陷于贫病交迫中。其他清华、师院等校情况亦相似。
