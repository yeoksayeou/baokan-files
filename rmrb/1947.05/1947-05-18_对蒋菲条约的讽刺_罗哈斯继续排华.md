Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th: Manila dispatch: Philippine President Roxas has ordered the Immigration Bureau to strictly enforce the laws regarding the temporary residence of foreigners in the Philippines, and ordered the Immigration Bureau to regularly inspect these foreigners with temporary residence permits to prevent them from exceeding their temporary residence period. It is reported that Chinese people constitute the majority of these foreigners temporarily residing in the country. In order to plan further restrictions on overseas Chinese entering the Philippines, the Immigration Bureau will soon submit several important amendments to the Immigration Law to the Presidential Palace. The contents of the amendments are: (1) Increase the payment for foreigners temporarily traveling to the Philippines from $500 to $2,500. (2) Tourists visiting the Philippines can only reside for one month. (3) Temporarily prohibit foreigners engaged in business from staying in the Philippines as temporary travelers. At the same time, in order to prevent overseas Chinese from entering the country "illegally," the Immigration Bureau has suggested sending two immigration investigation commissioners to Xiamen, Taiwan, and other Chinese ports.

　　对蒋菲条约的讽刺
    罗哈斯继续排华
    【新华社陕北十五日电】马尼刺讯：菲总统罗哈斯已令移民局严格执行关于外人暂居菲律宾之法令，并令移民局经常检查此等具有暂居证件之外人，使彼不得超过暂居期限。闻此等暂居本国之外人，以中国人为最多。移民局为计划进一步限制华侨进入菲境，不久将向总统府提出移民法之若干重要修改，其修改内容为：（一）增加暂时旅菲外人纳款自五百美元至二千五百美元。（二）来菲游行客仅可居住一月。（三）暂时禁止经商外人作为暂时旅客留菲。同时移民局为禁止华侨“非法”入境，已建议派遣移民调查专员二人，驻厦门台湾及其他中国港口。
