The Bianqu (Border Region) Literary Association Seeks Lyrics and Songs for the Front Lines

A letter from the front lines states: Soldiers generally lack songs to sing. Our front-line soldiers are performing meritorious service for the people and constantly achieving great victories, and should be praised and inspired by magnificent songs! The Bianqu Literary Association is therefore launching a solicitation campaign, hoping that literary and art circles at the front and in the rear will enthusiastically participate. The application methods are listed below:

One: Content: All themes related to the front lines are welcome, such as marches for the field army, campaigns for meritorious service, military-civilian relations, respecting officers and loving soldiers, mutual assistance, as well as joining the army, supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to military families, and supporting the front lines.

Two: Lyrics can be submitted separately. The melody and rhythm of musical scores must be majestic and powerful, suitable for chorus singing.

Three: Once a manuscript is adopted, the Literary Association will first issue a fee of 150-500 yuan for each set of lyrics, and 200-600 yuan for each musical score. Each full song (including lyrics) will receive 350-1000 yuan. Copyright fees will still be paid to the author when published. If it becomes popular at the front and is well-received, once reflected by the front lines, additional bonuses will be issued as encouragement!

Four: Music workers are requested to write to register immediately. After the Literary Association receives the lyrics, they will be mimeographed and sent out for musical composition.

Five: Manuscripts (especially musical scores) must be clearly copied with a writing brush or fountain pen, and the envelope should be marked "Frontline Song Submission" and mailed to the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Literary Association. The Literary Association has the right to modify and prioritize the publication of manuscripts.
