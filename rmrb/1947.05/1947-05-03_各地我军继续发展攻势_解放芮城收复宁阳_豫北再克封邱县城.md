　　Our Army Continues to Develop Offensives in Various Places
    Liberation of Ruicheng, Recovery of Ningyang, Recapture of Fengqiu County Town in Northern Henan
    [Xinhua News Agency, Urgent Dispatch from the Tongpu Front, 30th] The Jinan People's Liberation Army continued to advance, approaching Ruicheng County Town on the morning of the 29th. The defending enemy fled to the south bank of the Yellow River upon hearing the news, and the city was thus liberated by us. Ruicheng is the 19th county town newly liberated by our army in Southern Shanxi.
    [Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 1st] Following the great victory in Tai'an, the East China People's Liberation Army took advantage of the victory to counterattack Ningyang City, west of the Jinpu Railway, at dawn on the 28th. It captured the four gates in fifteen minutes, launched a general offensive at 6 p.m., and broke into the city from several directions at 9 p.m., eliminating the remaining Chiang troops. By 3 a.m. on the 29th, the city had returned to the hands of the people. The results of the battle are being tallied. Also, on the same day, Democratic Government County Chief Li entered the city to comfort the residents and quickly restore democratic order.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Henan Front, 30th] A unit of the JiluYu People's Liberation Army recaptured Fengqiu County Town on the 26th, annihilating a portion of the enemy and capturing over 70 people and guns. Our army recovered the city on March 26th, then moved its troops to carry out new combat missions. The city was reoccupied by Chiang's troops, and now it has returned to the hands of the people.
    [This newspaper, Northern Henan Front, 30th] A certain unit of the JiluYu Local Corps launched a fierce attack on the first company of the first battalion of the puppet Fengxian Security Regiment entrenched in Chenzhai (more than ten miles west of Jinxiang City) on the night of the 22nd. Most of the defending enemy was annihilated in a battle lasting more than thirty minutes. The second and third companies of the battalion reinforced twice, but were repelled. More than forty enemy soldiers, including the deputy company commander, were killed and over twenty were captured. Three light machine guns, forty rifles, and some ammunition were seized.
    [This newspaper, Northern Henan Front, 30th] The Taihang People's Liberation Army Headquarters issued a call this month to its subordinate brigades and sub-district troops to annihilate 8,000 enemies during the summer (April, May, and June). After heated deliberation and discussion, the brigades, regiments, battalions, companies, platoons, squads, and mutual-aid groups for killing the enemy enthusiastically responded with telegrams. Brigade X, Brigade X, Brigade X each planned to kill 1,800, Sub-district X planned to kill 1,500, Sub-district X planned to kill 1,300, Sub-district X planned to kill 1,000, Sub-district X planned to kill 600. After twenty days of hard fighting, the troops on the Northern Henan Front, in addition to killing and wounding 1,495 enemies, captured 3,288 officers and soldiers, including the enemy regimental commanders Zheng Jianqiu and Lu Wenying. In the Battle of Qixian alone, Sub-district X troops captured 1,117 enemies, completing more than two-thirds of their mission. They are full of confidence and determined to exceed their own plans for killing the enemy. In order to accurately assess heroes and models, it is stipulated that the capture of prisoners and the seizure of weapons are to be used as the criteria for inspection. The receipt from the reception center is the standard for prisoners, and the receipt from the Military Region Headquarters is the standard for weapons; if the unit needs it, the approval slip from the Military Region is the standard. The campaign to kill the enemy and compare contributions is being enthusiastically carried out in various units. (Shi Hong)
