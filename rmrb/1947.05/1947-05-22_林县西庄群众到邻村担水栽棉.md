　　Lin County Xizhuang Villagers Carry Water to Neighboring Villages to Plant Cotton
    [This Newspaper, Lin County News] The entire village of Xizhuang is mobilized to carry water to neighboring villages to plant cotton. Xizhuang itself lacks drinking water, but because the village profited from carrying water to plant cotton last year, the village is very active this year when the government calls for carrying water to plant cotton. Cadres personally lead the entire village, men and women, to mobilize to carry water from Xihuang, Munan, and other villages two to five *li* away to plant cotton. Priority is given to the families of military personnel and veterans. Now, each military family has planted an average of more than one *mu* of cotton, and ordinary people have planted an average of five *fen* to one *mu*. Kang Qinwang Yuancheng's team is the fastest in planting. Elementary school teacher Sun Wei carries water to lead students to plant cotton, and broadcasts the results every evening, greatly increasing the enthusiasm of the masses for planting cotton.
    [Another Dispatch] The teachers and students of Heshun Elementary School carried water to plant 7.5 *mu* of cotton in half a day (originally planned for one day). Everyone is in high spirits, unanimously saying that human power can overcome nature. Not only will we plant cotton, but we will also mobilize the masses to carry water to plant cotton. Taking advantage of the half *xiang* of rain, all senior students and some junior students were immediately organized to go to the countryside, divided into three groups under the personal leadership of Principal Zhao. After two days of hard work, the students personally carried water to plant 28.8 *mu* of cotton for military families and hoed wheat on 35.5 *mu*. Qu Yan and Niu Chunfu, fifteen-year-old third-grade junior students, returned in the morning and mobilized sixteen children in the afternoon, hoeing wheat for military families on 15 *mu* in one afternoon and carrying water to plant 2 *mu* of cotton the next day.

　　林县西庄群众到邻村担水栽棉
    【本报林县讯】西庄全村总动员到邻村担水来植棉、西庄本村连吃的水都有没，但是由于该村去年担水植棉得了利，所以今年政府号召担水植棉时，该村非常积极，干部亲自领导全村男女齐动员到离本村二里至五里的西皇、木南等村担水植棉，并先给军属和参战人员的家属种，现在每家军属都平均种上一亩多花了，一般人每家也平均种五分至一亩了。抗勤王元成领导的一组种的最快，小学教员孙伟一担水领导学生种花，每晚上广播成绩，群众种花的劲头很大。
    【又讯】河顺高小师生，半天担水植棉七亩半（原计划一天），大家情绪很高，一致说人力能胜天，不光咱植棉，还要发动群众担水植棉，乘着天下了半垧雨，当即组织全部高级生及部分初级生下乡，分为三组由赵校长亲自领导，经两天的突击，学生亲自担水给军属种花二十八亩八分，锄麦子三十五亩半。十五岁的初级三年级学生曲言的、牛纯福，上午回去，下午即发动了十六个儿童，一下午给军属锄麦子十五亩，第二天又抬水种棉花二亩。（博学）
