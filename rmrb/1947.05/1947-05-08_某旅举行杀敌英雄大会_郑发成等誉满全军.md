[Report from the North Henan Front, May 5th] Our reporter Wu Xiang reports: After the great victory in North Henan, a certain brigade of the Field Army held a brigade-wide meeting of combat heroes on the 26th at their station. At 9:00 AM, the heroes from various units, riding warhorses, wearing new uniforms, adorned with large red flowers, and carrying newly captured weapons, entered the solemn venue amidst the sound of gongs and drums. The hero list displayed forty-six names, including Liu Congdao, a new soldier from Cixian who had only been enlisted for three months, and Wang Fenglian, who had come over from Xitaiji less than four months prior. Both became heroes in this campaign, truly demonstrating that victories beget greater victories, and heroes emerge in greater numbers. During the meeting, the heroes reported on their heroic deeds and exchanged combat experiences. First-class hero Zheng Facheng narrated how he commanded six soldiers to charge into the fortifications on the wall of the Jiang army's stronghold at Xitaiji, advancing in the darkness and seizing eight light and heavy machine guns and forty-three rifles. He also described how, after being wounded, he used his teeth to sever the fuse of a hand grenade, defeating the Jiang army's counterattack. Every simple and vivid statement overflowed with high levels of bravery and resourcefulness, earning warm applause from the entire audience. Another first-class hero, Li Cunkao, stood up and expressed his boundless respect, stating that he would follow Zheng Facheng's example. The heroes proposed that these two outstanding heroes shake hands. As the two joyfully grasped each other's hands tightly, enthusiastic and sustained applause resounded throughout the venue, and the crowd shouted, "Learn from Zheng Facheng, combine bravery with tactics and techniques!" In their speeches, the heroes all emphasized the need to achieve even greater merits, transforming from third-class and second-class to first-class and special-class. They hoped that more comrades from their own squads and platoons would participate in the next meeting, and they challenged each other in this regard. Together, they formulated a competition pact: 1. Resolutely complete combat missions, combine bravery with tactics and techniques, and ensure large captures with small casualties; 2. Lead the masses, cultivate new heroes, and make great contributions to the people; 3. Abide by mass discipline and strengthen the relationship between the army and the people. The brigade leaders spoke, humbly expressing their willingness to learn from the heroes and pointing out that the heroes should also continue to learn humbly, further combining bravery with tactics and techniques, creating more Zheng Fachengs, fighting larger annihilation battles, and swiftly ending the rule of the Jiang bandits. The meeting then proceeded to a meal, photography, awards presentation, and adjournment.
