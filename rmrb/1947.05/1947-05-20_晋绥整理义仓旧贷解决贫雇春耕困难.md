Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 14th: Jin-Sui is making every effort to solve the spring plowing difficulties of poor peasants. In addition to providing interest-free loans of 900,000 yuan from the accumulated production of troops and government organizations over the years, land reclaimed over many years and purchased cattle, farm implements, and fertilizers are also given to poor peasants and hired laborers without compensation. Such land reaches 36,000 mu in four counties including Wuzhai and Kelan. Various localities are also coordinating with land reform to reorganize the public granary's accumulated loan funds and distribute them to poor and remote villages. Shenchi, based on the principle of "repay if you can, waive if you cannot," has reorganized more than a thousand dan of old loan grain, solving the spring plowing seed and food problems for nearly a thousand poor peasant households. In areas that have undergone land reform, the solution to spring plowing difficulties is combined with a review. For example, the review in Shenchi and Guqu villages cleared more than one hundred mu of land, eight dan of food grain, and five hundred loads of fertilizer, which were distributed to twenty-eight poor military dependents, demobilized soldiers, and peasants. After the difficulties of the poor peasants and hired laborers were solved, they enthusiastically expanded production.

　　晋绥整理义仓旧贷解决贫雇春耕困难
    【新华社晋绥十四日电】晋绥正全力解决贫苦农民春耕困难。各部队、机关除以历年生产积蓄之九十万万元无利贷与农民外，并将多年垦出之土地及购置之耕牛、农具、肥料等无贷价赠与贫苦农民。此种土地在五寨、岢岚等四县即达三万六千亩。各地亦配合土地改革，整理义仓蓄贷粮款转发给贫苦偏僻村庄。神池根据“能还即还，不能还即免”的原则，已整理出旧贷粮千余大石，解决了近千户贫苦农民的春耕种籽与粮食。经过土地改革的地区，则结合复查解决春耕困难，如神池、谷渠村复查又清算出土地百余亩、食粮八石，肥粪五百驮、分给二十八户贫苦军属、复员军人和农民。贫雇农困难解决后，均热烈扩大生产。
