　　(Delayed report) Taiyue, 23rd (By our correspondent) The remnant troops of Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan in Jingsheng Town, Lingshi, were forced to withdraw on the 29th of last month after being besieged day and night by our militia. Jingsheng was thus liberated. After the enemy occupied the town in early April, the district headquarters immediately led the militia to conduct a siege. A ring of minefields was set up around the town to strictly blockade it, killing 83 enemies in succession. The enemy was extremely terrified and had to flee in a hurry.
