Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 5th: In the 32 townships in central Nantong, where Chiang Kai-shek's army maintained the strictest control, 23 townships have returned to the hands of the people, and the other nine have become guerrilla zones. Rural democratic political power has been universally re-established, and the people's guerrilla forces have increased sixfold. This area is located between the important towns of Shigang, Jinsha, and Sanyu in northeastern Nantong. From November of last year, a Chiang Kai-shek army regiment and over 1,500 local Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops conducted a "comprehensive stationing and suppression" campaign in the area, occupying 23 townships. In mid-February, the People's Liberation Army counterattacked in Tangcha, and the main force of the Chiang Kai-shek army was forced to move north. The local armed forces launched continuous counterattacks, removing eight strongholds including Sanyu in just over a month, compressing the enemy to the line of Shigang, Jinsha, and Sijiaba. At the same time, a mass political offensive was launched, winning over 200 "Homecoming Legions" to reintegrate. At this point, the enemy's "suppression" completely failed, and the local lackeys who had been painstakingly cultivated were also defeated.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 8th: In the half-month following the great victory at Libao, over 800 Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops and district/township chiefs in various parts of central Jiangsu surrendered and reintegrated with the People's Liberation Army, or fled. On April 8th alone, 22 soldiers from the 315th Regiment of the 105th Brigade of the 49th Division of Chiang Kai-shek's army, which had reoccupied Libao, deserted. According to Zhou Guangming, a third-class soldier from the 3rd Battalion of the 304th Regiment of the 102nd Brigade of the Chiang Kai-shek 4th Division who escaped from Fuan on the 18th, of the new recruits from Anhui Province who were added to the battalion in January, nine were in the mortar platoon, and seven deserted. Among the local Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops, only the Yuwang Township Chiang Kai-shek Self-Defense Force along the Jiang (Yan), Qu (Tang), and Hai (An) lines had only three remaining out of thirty deserters in the past half month. Chiang Kai-shek army officers were unable to stop the desertions and vented their anger on the local Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops. Xu Rongsou, the commander of the Chiang Kai-shek Haimen Security Brigade, and Jiang Fangku, the commander of the "suppression" were dismissed from their posts, and Li Jinyi, the captain of the Tiaomen Security Brigade, and Gu Tianlong, the district chief of the Chiang Kai-shek 6th District, each received a major demerit.

　　南通恢复广大乡村  普遍重建民主政权
    苏中蒋伪八百余向我投诚自新
    【新华社华中五日电】蒋军控制最严之南通中部三十二个乡，已有二十三个乡重归人民之手，另九个乡成为游击区，乡村民主政权普遍重建，人民游击队发展六倍。按该地处于南通东北石港、金沙、三余等重镇间，去年十一月起，蒋军一个团及土著蒋伪一千五百余人，向该地进行“全面驻剿”，侵占二十三个乡。二月中旬，解放军在樘茶反击，蒋主力被迫北调，该地地方武装连续反击，月余拔除三余等八个据点，将敌压缩在石港、金沙、四甲坝一线，同时展开群众性的政治攻势，争取二百余“还乡团”自新，至此敌之“清剿”全告失败，处心积虑扶植之土著爪牙亦告溃灭。
    【新华社华中八日电】李堡大捷后半月中，苏中各地蒋伪军及区乡保长等，向解放军投诚自新或流亡者八百余人。四月八日一天中，重占李堡之蒋四十九师一○五旅三一五团有二十二人逃散。据十八日由富安逃出之蒋四师一○二旅三○四团三营三等兵周光明谈：该营一月间补充之安徽籍新兵，在迫击炮排者九人，逃掉七人。土著蒋伪逃亡仅姜（堰）、曲（塘）、海（安）线的于王乡蒋自卫队半月来自三十人逃剩三人。蒋军长官无法阻遏，迁怒土著蒋伪。蒋海门保安大队长徐容寿“清剿”指挥官蒋方魁被撤职，眺门保安队长李仅一、蒋记六区区长顾天龙各记大过一次。
