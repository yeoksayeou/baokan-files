　　Record of Sun Dianying's Capture
    Su Zhong, Hua Bo
    The People's Liberation Army's heavy artillery blasted a gap in the northeast corner of Tangyin, and the 1306 Unit swarmed in, initiating a fierce battle for control. The traitor Sun Dianying used all the artillery and bombs he could muster to bombard the gap, and desperately counterattacked with his most elite regiment. The people's soldiers, like roaring mountain torrents, charged straight into the enemy ranks, and Sun's troops began to collapse. He panicked and fled the city with some men through a narrow, dog-hole-like opening, and burrowed into Shizhuang village on the edge of the city, attempting to break through. Deputy Instructor Chai Bingqi tracked him down, and the Fifth Company soldiers, fearing they wouldn't make it through the hole in time, jumped over the city wall and pounced on Shizhuang. Hero Wang Qingshan and his team repelled Sun's three fierce attacks, preventing the enemy from escaping. Then, cries of "Lay down your arms and you won't be killed!" and "Don't die for Sun Dianying!" resounded from all directions; the gunfire from Sun Dianying's soldiers gradually subsided. Sun, uneasy, ran from one courtyard to another, finally saying to his deputy commander: "Surrender, it's no use." His surrounding entourage, adjutants, and staff officers breathed a sigh of relief and shouted in all directions, "Please don't shoot, we surrender." Then the寨gate opened, and the group of prisoners led by Sun Dianying filed out one after another. Sun Dianying bowed deeply to Instructor Chai, saying, "I hope the political commissar will take care of us, and please convey to your army brothers to be careful of landmines when entering the village." Sun's senior advisor Shao Wenyuan and four or five puppet soldiers stood on the寨wall, constantly telling our comrades: "Go this way, there are landmines there." The寨wall was immediately filled with people's soldiers, asking each other: "Who is Sun Maizi? Who is Sun Da Maizi?" Sun Dianying walked dejectedly, answering in a low voice, "Brothers, that's me, that's me." Following behind him were Deputy Commander Liu Yueting, Chief of Staff Deng Fuxuan, and others. Behind them, countless soldiers formed a long line.

　　孙殿英被俘记
    苏众　化波
    解放军的重炮把汤阴东北角轰开一个缺口，一三○六部队蜂涌而上，猛烈的争夺战展开了。孙逆殿英以所有能集中的炮火、炸弹向缺口猛烈轰击，并以他最精锐的一团拚命的反扑，人民的战士像怒吼的山洪一样直冲敌阵，孙逆的兵马开始溃散了。他慌忙带了些人，从窄的像狗洞一样的洞口逃出了城，钻到城边石庄，企图夺路而走。副教导员柴兵起跟踪追出，五连战士怕钻洞来不及，便从城墙上跳过去，猛扑石庄。杀敌英雄王清山和他的队伍，击退了孙逆的三次猛扑，使敌人无法夺路逃走。接着四面八方“缴枪不杀”、“不要替孙殿英送死”的喊声响成一片；孙殿英士兵还击的枪声逐渐稀疏了。孙逆不安的从这个院跑到那个院，最后向他的副司令说：“投降吧，不中用了。”他周围的随从、副官、参谋们松了一口气，向四方喊叫着说：“请别打了，我们缴枪。”接着寨门打开，以孙殿英为首的俘虏群鱼贯而出。孙殿英向柴教导员深深的一鞠躬说：“望政委关照，请转达贵军兄弟，进村时留心地雷。”孙的上校顾问邵文远和四、五个伪军立在寨墙上不断的告诉我们的同志：“往这边走，那里有地雷。”寨墙上立刻站满了人民战士，互相询问：“谁是孙麻子？谁是孙大麻子？”孙殿英一面颓丧的走着，一面以低沉的声音回答：“兄弟就是，兄弟就是。”跟在他后面的是副司令刘月亭、参谋长邓甫喧等。在他们后面，无数的士兵拉成一条长长的行列。
