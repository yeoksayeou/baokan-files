　　Xinhua News Agency, Shaanxi Front, 23rd: Young farmer Wang Shutong cleverly captured Xiao Bolian, an important escaped prisoner of the Jiang-Hu army, and won the glorious title of militia hero; and received a generous reward. Xiao Bolian, commander of the 499th Regiment of the 167th Brigade of the Jiang-Hu army captured in the Panlong battle, was injured in a fall from his horse and sent to a hospital by the People's Liberation Army for treatment. The hospital immediately assigned a nurse to take care of him and issued him a subsidy of 800,000 Border Region currency for his illness. Unexpectedly, Xiao was determined to continue serving as a traitorous running dog of Chiang Kai-shek, persisting in his criminal acts of harming the country and the people. Taking advantage of the lenient treatment of the People's Liberation Army, he took the opportunity to escape. At dawn on the 15th, he arrived at Zhangjiaping Village, north of Yan'an County, five miles from the Jiang-Hu army's cordon line. Wang Shutong, a local farmer, was going up the mountain to cut firewood and saw him acting suspiciously. He interrogated him, and Xiao falsely claimed: "I am from the × Column, and the commander is from my hometown. He sent me to Yan'an to scout out the enemy's situation." Wang Shutong asked him for a travel permit, but Xiao said: "Those who do reconnaissance work never carry travel permits." As he spoke, he ran away. At this time, this resourceful farmer realized that he must be an escaped prisoner, so he gripped his firewood axe and chased after him, grabbing him. He sternly said, "I don't care if you are from the commander's hometown, without a travel permit, no one can escape." Xiao Bolian immediately shamefully took out 400,000 Border Region currency to attempt bribery, but Wang Shutong resolutely refused. Xiao then threatened, "I am a 'Nationalist soldier.' If you don't let me go, we will bury you alive when we come back." Wang Shutong was enraged upon hearing this and immediately tied Xiao up and sent him to a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army. Wang Shutong received a warm welcome and reception from the local soldiers and civilians and was presented with a good rifle and many bullets. The county government also sent a special person to pay tribute and awarded him the glorious title of militia hero.

　　延安农民王树桐捉回逃俘萧伯廉
    【新华社陕北前线二十三日电】青年农民王树桐，机智捉回潜逃之蒋胡军重要俘虏萧伯廉，获得民兵英雄光荣称号；并受重赏。蟠龙战役所俘之蒋胡军一六七旅四九九团团长萧伯廉，因乘马不慎跌伤，经解放军送往医院治疗。院方即派护士加以照料，并发给病中补助费边币八十万元。孰料萧竟决心继续充当卖国贼蒋介石走狗，坚持其祸国殃民的罪恶行径，利用解放军之宽大待遇，乘隙逃跑。十五日拂晓，到达距蒋胡军警戒线五里之延安县北张家坪村，适有该地农民王树桐上山砍柴，见其行迹可疑，当予盘查，萧诡称：“我是×纵队的，司令员和我是老乡，他派我去延安侦察敌情。”王树桐向他要路条，萧说：“做侦察工作的从来不带路条。”边说边跑，此时这一机智农民已明白他一定是俘虏逃跑，于是紧握砍柴斧头，急追上去，将他抓住。厉声说：“我不管你是不是司令员的老乡，没有路条，谁也走不脱。”萧伯廉立即可耻地拿出边币四十万元企图行贿，被王树桐毅然拒绝。萧又威吓说：“我就是‘国军’，你不放我走，我们回来时准把你活埋掉。”王树桐听罢此话，无名火起，立即将萧绑起送至人民解放军某部。王树桐受到当地军民热烈欢迎与接待，并赠予上好步枪一枝及子弹多发。某县县政府亦派专人前往致敬，给予民兵英雄光荣称号。
