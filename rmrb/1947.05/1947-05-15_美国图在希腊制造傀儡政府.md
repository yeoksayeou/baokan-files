　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th -- TASS reports: New York Herald Tribune reporter, Mr. Follieting, reported from Athens that U.S. officials are currently actively plotting to form a "new government" in Greece. This new government must be composed of agreeable "democratic elements" who can cooperate with the U.S. economic mission and fairly distribute U.S. aid, to serve as Prime Minister. The reporter stated that since May 5th, U.S. Ambassador MacVeagh has been in discussions with many officials of the current Greek government. Follieting continued: Among those currently being considered are former Prime Minister Plastiras, the royalist Tsaldaris, and the liberal Sophoulis. The reporter pointed out: If Plastiras is chosen, it may increase the differences between Britain and the U.S. in resolving the Greek issue. Because two years ago, Plastiras did not get along well with British officials.
