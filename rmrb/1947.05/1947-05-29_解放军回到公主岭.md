Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, May 27th: Our special correspondent Liu Baiyu reports: Gongzhuling was liberated again at midnight on the 19th of this month. When a unit of the Democratic Allied Army, in hot pursuit of the remnants of the enemy, entered the city, the railway station was still filled with smoke and chaos, and the locomotives were still running. After our army fired upon them, the locomotives fled in panic, forced to abandon the last train on the platform. The next morning, braving the danger of enemy planes strafing back and forth, the reporter arrived in the suburbs. At that time, intense gunfire was still heard in the city, but it soon ceased. A general of the Democratic Allied Army, riding a white horse, personally led a cavalry contingent and officially entered Gongzhuling via the railway bridge from the station.

　　During the Battle of Siping last year, the reporter was once here. Now, seeing the station buildings, flowers, trees, and streets again, I am even more excited. Especially the thousands of people, raising their arms and shouting, "We haven't seen you for a year!" Many soldiers in the troops also showed respect and greeted the masses: "How are you?" Most touched was an old man with white hair, who said, "If you hadn't come back, we would have starved to death!" Grain prices here are incredibly high. Grain is piled up like mountains at the two stations. Especially in the last seven days, all the shops have been closed, and tens of thousands of citizens have been driven to dig fortifications. But before the fortifications were finished, the Democratic Allied Army had already entered the city. It is said that in the last train to leave, Chiang's officials filled it with their families' belongings and even took a girls' school. The fleeing and collapsing soldiers were pushed off the moving train doors one after another. When the reporter inspected, countless embroidered shoes and cosmetics were abandoned on the platform, while blood-stained soldiers limped along the railway line.

　　Our troops stopped in the city center. The cavalry teams were divided into several groups to offer greetings in the streets and alleys. Immediately, a group of children came to report: "There are American guns here, new ones, go and get them!" Others came to report the location of warehouses. Immediately, a group of young people pushed a medium-sized jeep card hidden by the enemy in front of us.

　　The city of Gongzhuling immediately became lively, a true picture of a people's city, unfolded on this happy day.

　　解放军回到公主岭
    【新华社东北前线二十七日电】本社特派记者刘白羽报导：公主岭于本月十九日子夜重获解放，当猛追残敌之民主联军一部于开入城区时，车站上还是一片乌烟瘴气，火车头还在开动。经我军射击后，车头仓慌逃逸，不得不把最后一列车丢弃在站台上。记者次晨冒着敌机往复扫射的危险进抵近郊，当时市内还传出密集的枪声，旋即枪声停止。一位民主联军将领骑着白马，亲率骑兵行列，自车站经天桥正式进驻公主岭。
    去年四平保卫战时，记者曾抵此地，现在重睹车站房舍，花木街道，更加兴奋。尤其是千百群众，高举两臂，欢呼着：“一年不见了！”部队中不少战士也向群众示敬慰问：“你们好吗？”最受感动的是一个白发老人，他说：“你们再不来，我们就饿死了！”此间粮价奇昂，两车站上粮食囤积如山，尤其最近七日，商店全部停业，成万市民被驱逐去挖掘工事。可是工事还没有挖完，民主联军已经进入市内了。据说最后开走一列车中，蒋家官员装满自己家属财物，还带走一个女学校，把逃溃下来的士兵，都从开动了的车门上纷纷推下来。记者巡视时，月台上溃弃无数绣花鞋与化妆品，而血迹斑然的士兵，则一步一拐地顺着铁路线走去。
    我们的队伍停在市中心，骑兵队分成若干小组往各街巷慰问，立刻一群小孩来报告：“这里有美国枪，新的，还不去拿！”又有人来报告仓库地址的。立刻一群青年把敌人隐藏的一辆中型吉普卡推到我们面前来。
    公主岭市面立刻热闹起来，一幅人民城市的真情实景，展开在这个快乐的日子里。
