　　Concentrated Donkey Cart Support for the Front Lines
    Float Mountain County's Cattle and Donkeys Transform Labor
    [Our newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 13th] Float Mountain is implementing a county-wide production labor transformation to support the front lines. Based on the actual conditions of the county, the first and third districts have many donkey carts, while the second, fourth, and fifth districts have more cattle. Therefore, 500 donkey carts are being transferred from the first and third districts to support the front lines, and 70 head of cattle are being transferred from the fifth district to the first district for substitute plowing, and 180 head of cattle are being transferred from the second district to the third district for substitute plowing. Production committees have been established in counties, districts, and villages to uniformly regulate livestock power. The labor transformation methods are as follows: (1) A single-horse cart carrying 300 to 350 jin, traveling 60 li, will receive a 35-point work ticket, equivalent to three and a half labor days. A double-horse cart, if accompanied by two people, carrying 700 jin, traveling 60 li, will receive a 70-point work ticket, equivalent to seven labor days. If accompanied by one person, 10 points will be deducted, and the work points will be increased per jin if the load exceeds the specified amount. (2) A donkey carrying 100 jin, traveling 60 li, accompanied by one person, will receive a 20-point work ticket, equivalent to two labor days. More work points will be added for heavier loads and longer distances. (3) A person carrying 60 jin, traveling 60 li, will receive a 10-point work ticket. More work points will be added for heavier loads and longer distances, fewer points will be deducted for lighter loads and shorter distances. A stretcher carried by five people traveling 60 li will receive a 50-point work ticket, equivalent to five labor days. (4) When substitute plowers arrive in the substitute plowing areas, military families and civilian laborers participating in the war have priority. The head of the household is responsible for providing meals, fodder, and preparing farm tools. One person plowing one mu of stubble land with one head of cattle will receive a 10-point work ticket, equivalent to one labor day. Plowing and harrowing one and a half mu of cultivated land will receive a 10-point work ticket, equivalent to one labor day. Hauling manure will be evaluated and determined by cadres in consultation with the distance and quantity of the land. Sowing five mu will receive a 10-point work ticket, equivalent to one labor day. Odd jobs will be temporarily evaluated on a case-by-case basis. (5) If it rains, both the war participants and substitute plowers will rest, and both labor and livestock power will be counted as one day, each receiving a 10-point work ticket, each equivalent to one labor day. (6) Work tickets will be uniformly issued by the county government to each village. At the end of the month, the total work tickets earned by each labor force and livestock will be calculated, deducting the number of duty days and obligatory labor, and the remainder will be calculated according to the value of the work tickets.
