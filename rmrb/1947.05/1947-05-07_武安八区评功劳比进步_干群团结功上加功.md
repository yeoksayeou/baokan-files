　　Wu'an Eighth District Evaluates Merit, Compares Progress:
    Cadre-Masses Unity Adds Merit Upon Merit

    [This newspaper's Wu'an dispatch] The Eighth District's cadre unity movement has victoriously concluded. For over a month, in adjusting cadre-masses relations, the Party's and cadres' prestige has been greatly elevated. The masses' opinion is: "Only under the Communist Party's leadership can there be such good cadres." After the anti-feudal struggle, and then after the internal unity movement, the cadres have become even stronger. They believe this movement is equivalent to attending school for three years. Because the cadres universally satisfied the honest peasants' four demands: "Issue a list, change attitude, return excess gains, and no retaliation" (statistics from fifteen villages show that cadres returned 143 mu of land, 139 rooms, 319 pieces of clothing, 4 head of livestock, and 485,000 yuan), making the land reform in the entire district closer to complete thoroughness. During the unity movement, 1,007 new activists emerged. Another in-depth squeezing out of feudalism movement, based on cadre-masses unity, is continuing to unfold in conjunction with spring plowing.

    From April 22nd to 27th, 694 cadres, new and old activists, and honest peasants from the entire district held a unity and merit-establishment conference. The completion of land reform is a great mass heroic undertaking. Summarizing this from the bottom up through merit evaluation and model commendation is the main content of this conference. The conference pointed out the ten major merits of cadres and masses in the land reform in the entire district: (1) Recovering land and houses, fighting thoroughly to dig out the roots, recovering documents and demanding guns, going through "two rounds" repeatedly. (2) Relying on poor and middle peasants wholeheartedly, both men and women have contributed to emancipation, thoroughly breaking with the landlords, cutting off the tail and digging the hole. (3) Distributing land according to output, letting everyone freely discuss and evaluate, self-reporting and selecting according to needs, distributing fruits to everyone's satisfaction. (4) Advanced and backward are of the same root, originally all poor brothers, making revolution we are one family, "pulling out Chiang Kai-shek" we are of one heart. (5) Staying up late and delaying work for the sake of work, speaking practically and working honestly, being careful and sharp-eyed against sabotage, defeating the landlord's counterattack. (6) Good cadres are ideologically clear, making self-criticisms adds merit upon merit, resolving knots and uniting cadres and masses, returning excess gains to level the playing field. (7) Attacking "pillboxes" with united struggle, mobilizing backward villages through mutual assistance, no contradictions between large and small villages, rich and poor villages taking care of each other to achieve emancipation. (8) Mutual aid teams regulate labor, the front and rear organize exchange labor, cooperatives serve the people, accounts are clear and dividends are distributed on time. (9) Eliminating the ultra-poor peasants, adding livestock and making more manure, not wasting the fruits of blood and sweat; enriching the foundation, men plowing and women weaving. (10) Overthrowing Little Chiang and pushing down Old Chiang, showing loyalty by pulling out Chiang Kai-shek, practicing martial arts and making mines to protect family property, joining the army and going to the front. After careful selection, a total of 1,475 people in the entire district were credited with merit, of which 51 were elected as village models and 18 were elected as district-wide emancipation models. The District Mutual Aid Merit Establishment Committee specially issued certificates of commendation and posted red celebratory reports on the doors of the meritorious people's homes.

    The merit evaluation movement naturally formed a progress comparison movement. According to the masses' opinions, cadres and masses with merit and no mistakes, and those with merit and mistakes but who immediately corrected them, were all credited with merit. Those with mistakes who had not yet made self-criticisms were credited with merit, and could be supplemented with further merit later. Those who were credited with merit all automatically made self-criticisms and diligently asked the masses to "point out shortcomings." Those who in the past sought no merit but only sought no fault realized that having no merit was the same as having fault, and resolved to establish more merit in the future. During the merit evaluation, cadres realized that merit belonged to the masses, and without the masses there would be no individual merit. "Backward" masses regretted that they had awakened late, suffered more hardship, and also hindered everyone's thorough emancipation. Everyone resolved to finally level the playing field and squeeze out feudalism, establish merit again and again, establish small merit and then great merit, and supplement merit where there was none.

    From resolving knots and removing psychological burdens to the unity movement of evaluating merit and comparing progress, a democratic and lively new spirit has been created.

### 武安八区评功劳比进步  干群团结功上加功

　　武安八区评功劳比进步
    干群团结功上加功
    【本报武安讯】八区干部团结运动已经胜利结束，月余以来，在调整干群关系中，党与干部的威信大大提高，群众的舆论是：“只有共产党领导下才有这样好干部。”经过反封建斗争，又经过内部团结运动，干部更坚强起来，他们认为这次运动，顶住上三年学校。由于干部普遍的满足了老实农民的四个要求“出清单、改态度、退多得，不报复。”（十五个村的统计，干部退出多得果实一百四十三亩土地，一百三十九间房，三百一十九件衣服，四头牲口，四十八万五千元），使全区土地改革更接近于彻底完成。团结运动中又出现新积极分子一千零七人。又一次深入的挤封建运动，已在干群团结的基础上结合春耕继续展开。
    四月廿二号至廿七号全区干部、新老积极分子、老实农民六百九十四人，开了一个团结立功大会。土地改革的完成，是伟大的群众英雄事业，通过立功表模，自下而上的总结起来，是这次大会的主要内容。大会指出全区干群在土地改革中的十大功劳：（一）收回土地要回房，斗争彻底挖了瓤，收回文书要出枪，三番五次“溜二场”。（二）雇贫中农一条心，男女翻身都有功，和地主彻底分了家，割了尾巴挖了洞。（三）按产量分配土地，放开手大家评议，按需要自报自挑，分果实人人如意。（四）先进落后一股根，本来都是穷弟兄，闹翻身咱是一家人，“拔介石”咱是一条心。（五）为工作熬夜误工，讲实际老实作风，反破坏心细眼明，打垮了地主反攻。（六）好干部思想打通，作检讨功上加功，解圪瘩干群团结，退多得为了填平。（七）打“炮台”联合斗争，落后村互助发动，大小村不起矛盾，穷富村照顾翻身。（八）互助组调剂劳力，前后方组织变工，合作社为民服务，账目清按期分红。（九）消灭了赤贫贫农，添牲畜多多造粪，不浪费果实血汗；安富根，男耕女织。（十）斗垮小蒋推老蒋，为拔介石显忠良，练武造雷保家产，参战参军上前方。经过慎重的评选，全区共有一千四百七十五人记了功，其中五十一人当选为村模范，十八人当选为全区翻身模范。全区互助立功委员会特发给奖状表扬，并将红纸喜报贴到功臣家门上。
    评功运动自然形成了一个比进步运动；根据群众意见，对有功无过和有功有过，知过即改的干群都立了功。有错误尚未检讨改正的记了功，以后可补功。评上功的人都自动作了自我批评，而且努力要求群众给“指缺点”。过去不求有功但求无过的人，认识了自己没功就是有过，决心今后多立功。在评功中，干部认识了功劳是群众的，没有群众就没有个人功劳。“落后”群众则后悔自己觉悟迟，多受了罪，也阻碍了大家的彻底翻身。大家都决心最后填平挤封建，立功再立功，功小立大功，没功要补功。
    从解圪瘩去心病开始到评功劳比进步的团结运动，造成了民主活泼的新精神。
