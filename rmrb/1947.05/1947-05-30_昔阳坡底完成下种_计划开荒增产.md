　　Xiyang Slope Bottom Completes Sowing
　　Plans to Reclaim Wasteland for Increased Production
　　[Our newspaper Xiyang News] The Sixth District's Slope Bottom Village has 65 households with a population of 212 and 582 mu of land. Thanks to the organization of auxiliary labor, spring plowing and sowing have been completed after the return of the war participants, and the seedlings have begun to emerge, which makes everyone very happy. After discussion, a one-month plan from Small Full to Summer Solstice was formulated: 44 women in the village will help the men weed 320 mu of fields, each person weeding 0.6 mu per day, to be completed in half a month. While weeding, each person will also spin 1 tael of cotton per day, totaling 33 jin and 12 taels in half a month. Each jin earns 320 yuan, totaling 10,800 yuan. 44 male semi-laborers, in cooperation with the village's 16 oxen, will eliminate 48 mu of cultivated wasteland and repair and edge them, with each mu estimated to produce 5 dou of grain, increasing production by 24 shi in total. 44 male full laborers will each reclaim 2 mu of virgin wasteland, totaling 88 mu, with each mu estimated to produce 3 dou of grain, producing a total of 26 shi and 4 dou. Spare time will be used for carrying coal, with each person carrying 60 jin, earning 6 yuan per jin, each person earning 360 yuan per day, with a plan to earn 15,840 yuan in ten days. Combined with the money earned by women spinning cotton, the total of 26,640 yuan can buy 1,776 jin of salt at 150 yuan per jin, solving the village's eight-month salt consumption problem. A total of 136 mu of wasteland (both cultivated and virgin) will be reclaimed, and this year's grain production can be increased by 50 shi and 4 dou. (Xin Ying)
