[This report from our Lecheng correspondent] The North Ma Village Central Work Group of the Fourth District convened its third meeting on the 10th. Each village shared their experiences and situations. They conducted in-depth discussions and research on how to intensify cotton planting under the current drought conditions. The main reflection of the masses' thinking in each village was a wait-and-see attitude. This thinking included a tendency to be lazy and afraid of exerting effort, simply waiting for rain from the sky; another aspect was that carrying water for planting required three or four workdays per mu, while after the rain, it wouldn't even require one workday. They were afraid of suffering losses by planting early and unable to afford the wages. In addition, there was the issue of water usage. For example, North Ma, Sidi, and Bei＠ had five pools, but the water storage was low, and everyone was rushing to carry water, causing delays and wasted labor. Based on the situation, the workgroup discussed and researched solutions from a proactive perspective: 1. Implement a large-scale contract system. The entire village, using mutual aid teams as units, determined the amount of labor required per mu through democratic discussion, based on the distance from the river water. The whole team unified, labor and livestock were calculated according to the work completed. After planting was completed, they summarized together, conducted a large-scale "in and out" system, unified input of labor according to land, unified distribution of work according to labor power. The "ins and outs" of each laborer were offset, resulting in the number of long-term labor surpluses or deficits. This approach overcame disputes and contradictions about timing, rain or no rain, delays, and unfair water distribution. At the same time, it ensured the completion of the original plan. 2. Implement a full-scale mobilization. Accurately calculate and appropriately use labor and livestock, implement work-based compensation. Children, the elderly, and women all participated.

After research and discussion, each village felt it was very suitable, and the masses' enthusiasm immediately soared. Li Shuanpin, a 75-year-old man from Sidi, actively participated in burying seedlings every day. Mutual aid teams and squads in each village also proposed competition standards: complete the plan by the Beginning of Summer, ensure every planted mu survives, keep everyone busy, not waste a moment of labor, implement democratic solutions to problems, and evaluate contributions during the summary. Yang Jiangping's team in Jinqu started beating the gong before dawn, got up, ate, and went to the fields. Yang Zhenlong's team used ringing bells to unify the cotton planting action. Statistics from the three villages showed that they planted 110 mu of cotton in one day. The masses unanimously believed that there was a time limit and proposed the alert slogan "Grain Full, Flowers Don't Return Home," confident in completing water-carrying and cotton planting in nine days.

　　“小满花不归家”
    北马突击点花
    【本报黎城讯】四区北马村中心工作小组，十日召开了第三次会议，各村互相交流了经验情况，对目前天旱无雨如何突击栽棉花，作了深入讨论研究，各村群众思想反映，主要的是等待思想。这种思想包括有一种贪懒怕出力气，单纯等待天下雨；另一种是担水栽，每亩须用三、四个工，下了雨不用一个工，先种怕吃了亏，且出不起工资。此外，还有用水的问题，如北马、寺底、北＠有五口水池，但贮水不多，全村人都抢着要担，挤不开误了许多工。根据情况，工作小组从积极方面，讨论研究出办法：一、实行大包工制。全村以互助组为单位，把所有棉花地数都按离河水远近为标准，民主讨论出每亩的用工数目，全组统一起来，劳畜力按活计工，栽完后一起总结，进行大出大入的统一按地入工，统一按劳力分工，每个劳力的出入相抵消，就得出长工欠工数目。这样做法，克服了先后、有雨没雨、误工多少与水不公的争吵矛盾，同时都能保证完成原订计划。二、实行全力总动员。精确计算，适当使用劳畜力，实行按活计工，儿童、老汉、妇女全部参加。
    经过研究讨论，各村都感到很合适，群众情绪马上高涨。寺底七十五岁的老汉李拴品，每天积极去参加埋圪道。各村互助组、队又提出竞赛标准，立夏完成计划，栽一亩活一亩，不闲一个人，不浪费一刻劳力，实行民主解决问题，总结时评选功劳。靳曲杨江平队天不明就打罗，起床吃饭上地，其他杨振龙队是用打钟，统一栽花行动，三村统计一天栽花一百一十亩。群众一致认为时间有了限制，又提出“小满花不归家”的警惕口号，有信心的九天完成担水栽花。
