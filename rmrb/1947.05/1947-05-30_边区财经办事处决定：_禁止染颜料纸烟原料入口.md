　　Bianqu (Border Region) Financial Office Decides:
  　Prohibition of Import of Dyed Paper and Tobacco Raw Materials
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] According to reports from various places: In recent years, the import of dyes ranks first among our region's imports, accounting for more than one-half of the total import value. The second is tobacco raw materials. The import of these two kinds of goods is indeed a major obstacle to our economic construction. In order to develop a self-sufficient economy and promote the creation and use of local dyes and local tobacco raw materials, the Financial Office has decided that all foreign dyes and tobacco raw materials, except for tipping paper and tipping powder that are difficult to manufacture locally, which are temporarily allowed to be imported, are prohibited from being imported. This is of great significance for obtaining the initiative in import and export trade. During the process of prohibiting imports, most merchants may raise the prices of dyes and tobacco raw materials to seize excess profits. For this reason, the Bianqu (Border Region) Trade Bureau has made the following decisions: 1. All merchants in various places who have foreign dyes and tobacco raw materials in stock should immediately register with the local Industrial and Commercial Bureau or Office and no longer handle imports. 2. The prices of dyes and tobacco raw materials shall not be deliberately increased due to the cessation of imports. The price changes should follow the proportion of price increases and be jointly discussed and decided by the local Industrial and Commercial Bureaus and Offices and merchants' organizations. 3. If anyone takes the opportunity to raise prices or conceals stocks and fails to go through registration procedures, once discovered, they will be treated as smuggled goods and subject to a fine of 100%, and their stocks will not be confiscated.

    【本报特讯】据各地报导：年来染颜料入口，占我区入口之第一位，占全部入口总值二分之一以上，其次为纸烟原料，这二种货物输入，实为我经济建设之一大障碍。为发展自给自足经济，提倡创造使用土制染料土制纸烟原料，所有外来染颜料、纸烟原料，已由财办决定，除难以自造之拖纸拖粉，暂准入口，其他禁止入口。这对出入口贸易主动权之取得有很大意义。在禁止入口过程中大部商民，可能抬高染颜料、纸烟原料价格，攫取超额利润，边区贸易局为此特作以下决定：一、各地商民，凡存有外来染颜料、纸烟原料者，应即向所在地区工商局或事务所进行登记，不再办理入口。二、染颜料、纸烟原料价格，不得因停止入口故意提高，其价格变动，应随物价上涨比例，经各地工商局所，商人组织共同讨论决定之。三、如有乘机抬高价格，或私藏不履行登记手续者，发觉后准依私货论，予以百分之百的罚款处分，不没收其存货。（边区贸易通讯小组）
