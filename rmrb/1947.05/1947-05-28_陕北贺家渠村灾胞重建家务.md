Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 25th. Hejiaqu Village in Zichang, which was devastated by Hu Zongnan's troops, has begun to rebuild their homes with the help of the democratic government. Liu Jingfan, Deputy Chairman of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government, personally went to the village to express condolences to the affected masses, instructed cadres on their work, and allocated several shih of relief grain and tens of thousands of catties of wheat flour, for which the villagers were extremely grateful. They also requested the government to issue ten rifles to organize a joint village self-defense force, which was approved by the democratic government. With the help of the government and mutual assistance and adjustment among the masses, the village's farming tools and seeds have been resolved, and they are now rushing to plant crops. During the Panlong battle, in addition to sixteen people who went to the front lines to assist the army, those who remained in the village continued to work in the mountains as usual, rushing to plant melons and beans.

　　陕北贺家渠村灾胞重建家务
    【新华社西北二十五日电】惨遭胡军劫掠之子长贺家渠村，在民主政府帮助下已开始重建家务。陕甘宁边区政府刘景范副主席曾亲往该村慰问受灾群众，指示干部工作，并拨给救济粮数石、麦粉数万斤，村民极为感激。并要求政府发给步枪十枝，组织联庄自卫队，当获民主政府允准，在政府帮助和群众互助调剂下，该村农具种籽，已获解决，现正突击抢种。蟠龙战斗时，除十六人去前线帮助军队工作外，留在村里的人们均照常上山耕作，抢种瓜豆。
