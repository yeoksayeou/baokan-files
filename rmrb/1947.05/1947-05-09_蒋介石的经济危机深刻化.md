　　Chiang Kai-shek's Economic Crisis Deepens
    On April 18th, Chiang Kai-shek announced the "reorganization" of his "government," pulling the Political Study Clique, the Youth Party, and the Democratic Socialist Party – this batch of warlords, bureaucrats, politicians, compradors, and traitors – into the government. The day before, on April 17th, the prices in the Chiang-controlled areas began a new round of frenzied increases. For half a month, the price surge has been escalating, causing severe chaos in the entire Chiang-controlled area's economy. According to various sources, this price surge is more severe than the gold and dollar panic of February this year and is continuing to develop.

    During the February economic turmoil, Chiang Kai-shek promulgated an "Economic Emergency Measures Plan," forcibly transferring the economic disaster caused by the four major families onto workers, peasants, and small and medium-sized bourgeoisie. Under the guise of "emergency measures," he devalued his legal tender almost to a quarter of its value in September of last year, setting the exchange rate of US dollars to legal tender at 1:12,000 (the official rate in September last year was 1:3,050). This regulation was equivalent to robbing three-quarters of the people's property held in Chiang currency out of thin air. They thought this would delay the economic crisis for a period, but only two months later, a new and greater economic storm has befallen Chiang Kai-shek.

    According to May 4th reports, the black market price of US dollars in Shanghai has risen to 1:30,000, which is two and a half times higher than in February; most of this increase occurred in the 18 days after April 17th. On April 24th, the price of gold reached 1.1 million legal tender per tael, nearly two and a half times higher, with most of the increase also occurring in the eight days after April 17th. This economic crisis is not only reflected in the rise of gold and US dollars but also in essential goods. According to the Central News Agency's own reports on prices, general prices in Nanjing in mid-April had risen several times compared to December last year. Within April, the Central News Agency has called the surge in grain and yarn prices a "stunning record"; in fact, even more "stunning" "records" are being created from late April to now. The price of rice in Shanghai has risen to 300,000 legal tender per dan (official price is 168,000 legal tender) as of the 5th of this month; the price of a large bag of flour in Beiping on the 4th has risen from 200,000 legal tender a week ago to 350,000 legal tender; on April 29th, the price of rice in Beiping rose from 1,000 legal tender per jin to 3,500 legal tender; in Taiyuan, on April 21st, compared to the time of the February "Emergency Measures Plan," the price of wheat rose from 140,000 legal tender to 200,000 legal tender, and "Mingxing" cloth rose from 200,000 legal tender to 290,000 legal tender; in Changchun, the average price index in April rose by more than a quarter compared to March; in Fuzhou, the price of rice rose to over 220,000 legal tender on the 4th of this month; in Nanchang, the price of rice had risen to 120,000 legal tender on the 5th of this month; in Jinan, prices are "rising several times a day, and the market is gradually becoming chaotic" (Central News Agency). In addition, prices are rising everywhere in Kunming, Chongqing, Chengdu, Changsha, Wuhan, and other places. Based on extremely incomplete data, from the time Chiang Kai-shek issued the "Emergency Measures Plan" in February to April, the average price increase in various places was roughly doubled, while gold and US dollars more than doubled. The new price surge is first making the lives of the vast poor people increasingly desperate, forcing them to take risks. At the end of April, Shanghai workers, led by textile workers, formally demanded that the Chiang government abolish the freeze on wages at the January level. The rice-snatching riot that occurred in Hangzhou on the 2nd of this month destroyed rice shops and police stations. On the 3rd, Hangzhou rice merchants staged a large-scale petition, forcing the Zhejiang Chiang government to declare martial law in Hangzhou. Also, a thousand people attacked rice shops in Shanghai. Chiang's public employees in the Wuhan area, facing soaring prices and difficult living conditions, have decided to go to Nanjing to petition. Public employees in Baoding, whose salaries are insufficient to maintain the minimum living standard for one person, began formally signing petitions to Nanjing on the 5th; faculty and staff at Henan University in Kaifeng and Shandong University in Qingdao went on strike on the 4th and 5th, respectively, demanding increased compensation. Students at Shandong University also went on strike on the 5th. Bai Chongxi also expressed pessimism about military grain for the civil war at the Nanjing Grain Conference, saying, "The grain problem will become increasingly urgent."

    What solutions does the so-called "reorganized" "government" have for this nationwide price surge? None. They are still following the old path of "emergency measures" that has proven to be a complete failure, that is, internally intensifying the oppression and exploitation of the people, and externally reaching out to the United States for loans in an attempt to prolong its economic lifeline for the civil war.

    Chiang Kai-shek's response to this economic crisis is even more barbaric than in February, not allowing Shanghai newspapers to publish the well-known black market news and threatening newspaper editors and reporters with "arrest." On February 27th, he also promulgated the "Regulations on Penalties for Buying and Selling Gold and Foreign Currency," imposing extremely heavy penalties on those who buy and sell gold and foreign currency without the Chiang government's permission; that is to say, only the four major families have the special privilege to buy and sell gold and foreign currency. Despite such soaring prices, Shanghai workers' wages are still frozen at the January level and are not allowed to increase. The Shanghai Chiang government announced the implementation of rice "rationing" on the 5th, but immediately announced its cancellation. The Associated Press said that this was because "the situation is deteriorating, and the people are becoming increasingly uneasy," so the Chiang government was caught in a flurry.

    Chiang Kai-shek's only subjective hope is still to rely on US loans to inject a stimulant. But the Chiang Kai-shek dictatorial and traitorous rule, which is approaching total economic collapse day by day, can't find any magic formula for resurrection.

    The price surge in the Chiang-controlled areas that began in mid-April is like the third stage of syphilis for the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique: once it breaks out, the whole body is ulcerated and cannot be cured. "Emergency measures" don't work, celebrating the capture of Yan'an doesn't work, "reorganizing the government" doesn't work, and borrowing heavily from the United States will certainly not work either. Chiang Kai-shek's three crises, namely the political, military, and economic crises, stimulate and reinforce each other, like the eruption of a volcano. The Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique is sitting on this erupting volcano.

### 蒋介石的经济危机深刻化

　　蒋介石的经济危机深刻化
    四月十八日蒋介石宣布其“政府”“改组”，把政学系、青年党、民社党这批军阀、官僚、政客、买办、汉奸拉进政府。在这前一天即四月十七日，蒋管区物价开始了新的疯狂的上涨。半个月来，涨风正步步高升，已使整个蒋管区经济发生严重的混乱。据各方消息：这次物价暴涨，其剧烈程度超过了今年二月黄金美钞风潮；而且还在继续发展中。
    在二月经济风潮中，蒋介石颁布“经济紧急措施方案”，把四大家族所造成的经济灾难以强力转嫁到工人、农民和中小资产阶级身上，且在“紧急措施”的幌子下，把他的法币贬值几乎到去年九月的四分之一，即规定美金对法币的比例为一比一万二千元（去年九月官价为一比三零五零），黄金每两为法币四十八万元；这一规定，等于把使用蒋币的人民财产凭空抢去了四分之三。他们以为这样总可以把经济危机拖延一个时期，但仅仅两个月，新的更大的经济风潮已经降临到蒋介石的头上了。
    据五月四日消息，上海美金黑市已涨至一比三万，即比二月份涨了两倍半；此中大部分为四月十七日以后十八天内涨上者。上月二十四日黄金每两已达一百一十万元，即涨了近两倍半，而其大部分亦为四月十七日以后八天内涨成者。这一次的经济危机不仅表现在黄金美钞之上涨，而且表现在生活必需品上面。据中央社自己对物价的报导：南京四月中旬一般物价已比去年十二月涨了几倍。四月份内，粮食与纱布之涨风，中央社已呼为“惊人纪录”；其实由四月下旬到现在，更“惊人”的“纪录”还正在产生。上海米价至本月五日已涨至三十万元（官价为十六万八千元）；北平四日大袋面粉已由一周前之二十万元涨至三十五万元；上月二十九日，北平大米由每斤一千元涨至三千五百元；太原上月二十一日物价与二月“紧急措施方案”时比较，小麦由十四万元涨至二十万元，“明星”布由二十万元涨至二十九万元；长春物价四月份较三月份平均指数涨四分之一强；福州大米本月四日涨至二十二万余元；南昌大米本月五日已涨达十二万元；济南物价“一日数涨，市场渐趋紊乱”（中央社）。此外昆明、重庆、成都、长沙、武汉各地物价无处不涨，仅根据极不完全材料，蒋介石在二月份颁发了“紧急措施方案”后到四月为止，大体平均各地物价上涨了一倍，黄金美钞则在两倍以上。新的物价风潮首先是使广大贫苦人民生活日趋绝望，被逼挺而走险。上海工人四月底以纺织工人为先导，已正式向蒋政府提出取消冻结工资于一月份水平的要求。本月二日杭州所发生的抢米风潮，捣毁米店与警察派出所，三日杭州米商大请愿，使浙江蒋记政府不得不宣布杭州戒严；上海也发生了一千人打米店的事情。武汉区蒋记公教人员以物价飞涨，生活艰难，已决定赴南京请愿；保定公教人员也以薪津收入不足维持一人最低水准的生活，五日起正式签名向南京请愿；开封河南大学与青岛山东大学教职员，已于四五两日先后罢教，要求增加待遇，山东大学学生亦于五日罢课。白崇禧也在南京粮食会议上对于内战军粮表示悲观，他说：“粮食问题将益为急迫。”
    所谓“改组”了的“政府”，对于这个普及全国的物价涨风有什么办法呢？一点新办法也没有。他们仍然走着已经证明完全失败的“紧急措施”的老路，即对内更加紧压迫剥削人民，对外向美国伸手借债，以图延长其内战的经济命脉。
    蒋介石应付这次经济危机比二月份更加横蛮，不允许上海报纸刊登尽人皆知的黑市消息，拿“逮捕”来威胁报纸的编辑记者。二月二十七日又颁布了“黄金外币买卖处罚条例”，对于未经蒋政府允许买卖黄金外币者，将加以极重的处罚；就是说只有四大家族才有买卖黄金外币的特权。物价这样飞涨，上海工人的工资仍然被停留在一月份的水平，不许增加。上海蒋政府五日宣布实行米的“配给”，但是立刻又宣布取消。美联社说这是由于“形势日益恶化，人民渐趋不安”，所以弄得蒋政府手忙脚乱。
    蒋介石唯一的主观上的希望，还是凭借美债来打强心针。但是一天一天接近经济总崩溃的蒋介石独裁卖国统治，无论如何也找不到起死回生的妙计了。
    四月中旬开始的蒋管区物价风潮，对于蒋介石反动集团像到了第三期梅毒，一发起来周身溃烂，不可收拾。“紧急措施”不灵，打下延安开庆祝大会也不灵，“改组政府”又是不灵，大借美债也一定不会灵。蒋介石的三种危机，即政治、军事、经济的危机，互相激励，互相助长，犹如火山的喷发。蒋介石反动集团正是坐在这座喷发的火山口上。
