　　Weixian Daning Plants Early
    Sorghum and Cotton All Sprout
    [Jinan News, Southern Hebei, 9th] Daning Village, Second District of Weixian County, launched a spring plowing campaign and has already planted 400 mu of sorghum, 200 mu of cotton, and 50 mu of melons. The seedlings have all emerged. The seedlings of the militia members participating in the war and their families are particularly strong because the village planted them early on their behalf. More than 200 mu of other spring land have also been fully fertilized, plowed, and loosened, waiting to be sown. Due to the severe drought, the village is holding meetings to mobilize everyone to carry water for spot planting and is calling for preparations to dig wells to prevent drought.
    [Jinan News, Southern Hebei, 12th] The masses in Shengfo Tang, Weixian County, discussed and came up with a method of deep plowing and meticulous cultivation, deciding that plowing should be deep and meticulous, leaving no hard clods underneath. One ox should plow two mu per half-day (last year, two and a half mu). Harrowing should be done with two oxen pulling one harrow, with a person standing on the harrow, covering fifteen mu per half-day (last year, twenty mu per half-day). Last year, living-axle rollers were used for rolling the land, and one person could pull ten mu per half-day. This caused the clods to be pressed unevenly, allowing wind to escape, and the seedlings did not emerge well. This year, all rollers are changed to dead-axle rollers, with one person pulling at most one mu per half-day. It was decided that sideline production should be implemented throughout the year. Although manpower is lacking, the method of "starting work early and finishing late" can save some manpower for sideline production. Currently, Shi Decai's group's flour mill has earned more than 100,000 yuan, and Guo Mingyu's group has earned more than 70,000 yuan.

　　威县大宁及早播种
    高粱棉花全部出土
    【本报冀南九日电】威县二区大宁村突击春耕，已播种高粱四百亩，棉花二百亩，瓜五十亩，苗子都出来了，参战民兵及军属的苗子，因村中代耕种的早，比别家的特别旺。其余春地二百余亩也都全部施肥，耕完耙松，等待下种。因天气亢旱，村子正开会动员大家担水点种，并号召准备挖井防旱。
    【本报冀南十二日电】威县圣佛堂群众讨论出深耕细作办法，决定犁地要深细，底下不留硬垅，一牛一晌犁二亩（去年二亩半）耙地要两牛一耙，人立耙上，每晌十五亩（去年每晌二十亩）。去年砘地用活轴砘子，一人一晌能拉十亩，这样压不死垅眼，跑风，苗出不好。今年一律改用死轴砘子，一人一晌至多拉一亩。副业生产决定贯彻全年，人力虽缺，但用“早上工，晚下晌”的办法，即可省出一部分人力搞副业。现石德才组的粉坊已赚十万余元，郭明玉组已赚七万多元。
