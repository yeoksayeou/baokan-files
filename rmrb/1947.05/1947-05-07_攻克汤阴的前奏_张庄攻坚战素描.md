　　Prelude to the Capture of Tangyin
    A Sketch of the Battle of Zhangzhuang
    Ke Gang
    Five hundred meters northeast of Tangyin City, there is a small village of forty to fifty households called Zhangzhuang. The terrain here is high, and you can overlook the East Gate, North Gate, and the city from the rooftops. Therefore, when Sun Dianying decided to defend Tangyin to the death, he wholeheartedly strengthened the defenses of this highland area. Sun forced the peasants to do three months of hard labor, first digging an outer trench more than two zhang deep and more than one zhang wide around the village, then building a wall more than one zhang high inside the trench, and then completely according to the organization of the defensive firepower network, circular giant bunkers were arranged around the inside of the wall, protruding seven or eight chi from the wall; hidden bunkers were lined up inside the outer trench, and there were tunnels directly to the village.
    It seemed that Sun Dianying had indeed decorated Zhangzhuang very solidly. In principle, they should have been very relieved, but the reality was not like this. Many prisoners used their own experiences to explain this very strange principle to us. They said: The solid fortifications of Zhangzhuang not only did not embolden them, but made the serious fear in their hearts multiply even more dramatically. On the night when the People's Liberation Army had just entered the suburbs to camp, the city headquarters had ordered them: "Why is it so quiet outside? You dead pigs, afraid that the enemy is approaching the outer trench! Open fire quickly!" So the gunfire sounded like a strong wind into the dark distance all night. At dawn, it was still very quiet, and the headquarters ordered them to fill the area within three hundred meters around Zhangzhuang with landmines.
    On the morning of April 15th, Sun Dianying, looking flustered, spoke to the garrison troops in Zhangzhuang (two officer teams and one infantry battalion): "Zhangzhuang is the key to the gate of Tangyin City and must be defended to the death. You must remember Chairman Chiang's words: 'Don't be alarmed when surrounded, don't surrender when captured.' You must know that Liu Bocheng's army can only fight in the field and cannot attack fortifications. As long as you hold on, I will never let you suffer losses. You are all officers, my good capital!"
    Almost at the same time as Sun's speech, in the small house in Beisuzhuang, two li northwest of Zhangzhuang, the young commander of the Sixth Column, after learning that Li Wenbin, a mine-sweeping expert liberated from Shangguan Village, had led everyone to complete the entire mine-sweeping task with his exemplary action of sweeping away twenty-five landmines, drew three red arrows on a 1:50,000 military map from the east, west, and north towards Zhangzhuang, and then picked up the telephone receiver and, like arranging a sand table exercise, quickly and methodically deployed his various troops, and for the convenience of command, he ordered that each gun and enemy bunker be numbered.
    The telephones in the various artillery positions rang at the same time, and they received the same order: "Open fire!"
    The artillery bombardment lasted only fifty minutes, and all the bunkers protruding from the wall were destroyed. Smoke and fire obscured the entire Zhangzhuang.
    Platoon Leader Li Ruzhang led his warriors and broke through the front line and wedged deep into the village within twelve minutes.
    I was amazed at the accuracy of our gunners' shooting. No. 7 and No. 6 guns completely destroyed the fortresses and front-line fortifications within their range with only forty-seven shells. After No. 5 gun continuously bombarded the lower part of No. 6 bunker, the bunker immediately sank. The enemy soldiers in the bunker screamed and shouted, but none escaped.
    Unexpectedly, after the infantry broke into the village, the battle seemed to diminish. The enemy soldiers, malnourished and with their nerves disturbed by the huge roar, were busy hiding in various houses. Bunkers were gradually occupied by our troops. The Third Platoon of the Third Company quickly occupied nine courtyards, the battalion headquarters, and the ammunition depot, compressing the enemy into a few houses in the southwest corner. After a brief house-to-house sweep, under the smoke and darkness of the night, except for some who escaped, the rest laid down their weapons.
    At dawn, when cleaning the battlefield, four heads were exposed at the entrance of the No. 6 large bunker, with their bodies still pressed inside the bunker. The prisoners told us that this was because they wanted to escape when the first shell hit. At this moment, five so-called "good capital" of Sun surrendered with their weapons. They said: "Last night they escaped to the edge of the city, but the city was shooting and wouldn't let them in!"
    In this way, General Liu Bocheng's warriors captured the key to the gate of Tangyin City.

　　攻克汤阴的前奏
    张庄攻坚战素描
    柯岗
    在汤阴城东北五百公尺的地方，有个四五十家的小村名叫张庄。这里地形较高，站在屋顶上，可以眺望东关、北关和城里。因此，当孙逆殿英决心死守汤阴时，就全心全力加强这一带高地的防御。孙逆迫使农民用三个月的苦役，先在村周挖了两丈多深，一丈多宽的外壕，又在壕内筑起丈余高的围墙，而后又完全按照守备火力网的组织，围墙之内环布圆形巨堡，耸出围墙七八尺；外壕之内暗堡林立，并有地道直通村里。
    看样子孙逆殿英确实把张庄装饰得十分坚固了。按道理他们应该很放心的，但事实并不这样，许多俘虏都用自己的经历向我们说明这种很奇怪的道理，他们说：张庄的坚固工事不仅没有给他们壮胆，而使严重的恐惧在他们的心里更加激剧的繁殖起来。当人民解放军刚刚进入城郊宿营的夜晚，城里司令部曾这样命令他们：“为什么外面这样静呵？死猪们，怕是人家接近了外壕了！赶快开火！”于是枪声像大风似的向漆黑的远处打了一夜。天明，依然很静，司令部又命令他们在张庄周围三百公尺内满布了地雷。
    四月十五日上午，形色惶惶的孙逆殿英，给张庄的守备部队（两个军官队，一个步兵营）讲话：“张庄是汤阴城门的钥匙，必须死守。你们要记着蒋主席的话：‘被围不惊，被俘不屈’。要知道刘伯承的军队是只能野战不能攻坚的，只要你们坚守，我决不让你们受损失，你们都是军官，是我的好本钱呵！……”
    几乎和孙逆的讲话完全同时，在张庄西北两华里处，北苏庄的小屋里，六六部队的青年指挥员，得悉他从上官村解放来的扫雷能手李文彬以自己扫除二十五个地雷的模范行动，带领大家完成了全部扫雷任务之后，他在一张五万分之一的军用地图上，从东，西，北三面，向张庄画了三个红色箭头，而后，便拿起电话听筒，像布置沙盘作业一样，迅速而又有条理的，把他的各种兵都摆布开来，并为了指挥的便利他命令把每门炮和敌人的碉堡统统编了号码。
    各个炮兵阵地上的电话机同时响了，他们得到了同一的命令：“开炮”！
    炮弹的轰击仅仅持续了五十分钟，耸出围墙的碉堡全部毁灭了。烟火迷蒙着整个张庄。
    突击班长李如章带着他的勇士们，在十二分钟之内突破前沿，楔入纵深。
    我惊奇我们炮手们射击的准确，七号和六号炮只用了四十七弹便彻底摧毁了他们范围内的堡垒和前沿工事。五号炮向六号碉堡的下部连续轰击之后，那碉堡立即沉落下来。堡的敌兵狂呼乱喊，谁也没有逃脱。
    想不到，步兵突进村子之后，战斗反相形减色了，营养不良而又被巨大的轰鸣震乱了神经的敌兵，忙着向各个家屋去隐蔽，碉堡一座座逐步被我占领。三连三班很快就攻占了九座院子、营部和弹药库，把敌人压缩到西南角的少数民房，略经逐屋清扫之后，在硝烟和夜的暗幕下，除部分逃散外，其余的都放下了武器。
    天明，打扫战场的时候，有四颗人头露在第六号大堡的门口，身子仍压在堡内。俘虏告诉我们这是第一发炮弹打来时，他们想向外逃跑的。正在这时，有五个所谓孙逆的“好本钱”携械来降，他们说：“昨夜逃到城边，城上打枪不准进去！”
    就这样，刘伯承将军的勇士们夺获了汤阴城门的钥匙。
