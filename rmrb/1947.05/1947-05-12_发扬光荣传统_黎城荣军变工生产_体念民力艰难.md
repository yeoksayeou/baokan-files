　　Carry Forward the Glorious Tradition
    Licheng's Disabled Soldiers' Cooperative Production Empathizes with the People's Hardships

    [Our Newspaper Licheng News] Each district and village in Licheng held separate symposiums for families of military personnel, martyrs, cadres, and retired soldiers to educate them to cherish their glory, empathize with the people's hardships, rely on their own labor, engage in cooperative production, and overcome dependence. When retired soldiers in the sixth district held a meeting, retired soldier Zhang Yuanying called on everyone, saying: "Carry forward the glorious tradition of the Eighth Route Army—hard work, diligence, production, and thrift, and become prosperous through our own labor." Zhang Mancang immediately responded: "Now there is a shortage of labor for participating in the war and supporting the front. In order to reduce the burden on the masses and save workdays to support the front, I will not use substitute cultivation and will also help the families of military personnel with substitute cultivation." Peng Qinggui said: "We retired soldiers are taking the lead in liberation, and we must also take the lead in production. I want to rely on my own efforts to engage in production." The meeting also stipulated that self-reliance in cooperative production, without using substitute cultivation and helping military families with substitute cultivation, would be a condition for earning merit. At the same time, the masses were educated that in order to win victory at the front, they should do their best to help military families with production. According to the specific circumstances of the military families, whatever difficulties they have, help them with that, and determine whether there is a price for it. The substitute cultivation of land adopts a fixed group or household responsibility system, and the required labor is shared equally by all laborers in the village who have substitute cultivation tasks. After mobilization, the masses were extremely active in substitute cultivation. Qiu Shuyuan first helped the families of military personnel with weeding wheat without compensation. Li Tiantang and Zhang Tiedan, civil affairs cadres of Shangmajia Yu, automatically helped Li Siqing's family, a cadre's family, transport fertilizer for three mu of land. Immediately, Zhang Erguang and Li Qishun helped Li Youku's family, a military family, transport fertilizer. Labor hero Chen Guixian of Shanyaotou organized people to pull plows to help military families plant 23 mu of millet in order to seize the time for sowing. Because the military families, retired soldiers, and the masses empathized with and took care of each other, the substitute cultivation problem in each village was solved very well. For example, the masses of Lijia Yao wanted to help Li Zhouling's family, a military family, with all substitute cultivation without compensation, but old man Li Zhouling resolutely refused, saying: "Although I am old, labor is too scarce. I will slowly exchange work with everyone." But the masses insisted on substitute cultivation, and as a result, it was decided to help him with 15 workdays throughout the year. Wang Yunpeng and Zhang Xiaokao, retired soldiers from Baojiajiao, although they were old, unanimously and resolutely declined the substitute cultivation offered by the masses. The villagers said: "Old Wang and Old Zhang are really good. We don't even need to help them. That's good. We'll have to take care of them in the future." Wang Youcheng, a retired soldier from Dongwang, volunteered to help Wang Sentang's family, a military family, with substitute cultivation of one and a half mu of land. He said: "I originally didn't have any surplus labor, but because labor is scarce this year, I will squeeze in some work early and late to help the military family with production." (Yang Ke)

　　发扬光荣传统
    黎城荣军变工生产
    体念民力艰难
    【本报黎城讯】黎城各区村分头召开军、烈、干属、荣退军人座谈会，教育他们珍贵光荣，体念民力，依靠自己劳动，变工生产，克服依赖思想。六区荣退军人开会时，荣军张元英号召大家说：“发扬八路军光荣传统——吃苦耐劳生产节约，靠自己劳动发家致富。”张满仓立即影响：“现在参战支差劳力缺乏，我为了减轻群众负担，省下工好去支援前线，我不用代耕，还要帮助军属代耕。”彭青贵说：“咱们荣退军人翻身带头，生产也要带头，我要自力更生搞生产。”会上并规定自力更生变工生产不用代耕、且帮助军属代耕为立功条件。同时教育群众，为了前线胜利，尽力帮助军属进行生产。根据军属具体情况，啥困难帮助啥，确定有无代价，代耕地采取固定组或户的责任制，所需劳力，由全村有代耕任务劳力平均负担。自动员后，群众对代耕异常积极，秋树垣先帮助军属无代价锄麦，上马家峪民事干部李天堂、张铁旦自动帮助干属李思庆家运了三亩地肥。马上张二广、李起顺又帮助军属李有库家运肥，山窑头劳英陈贵贤为了突击下种，组织人拉犁先帮助军属种谷廿三亩。由于军属荣军与群众相互体念照顾，各村代耕问题解决得很好。比如栗家窑群众要帮助军属李周令全部无代价代耕，但李周令老汉坚决拒绝说：“我虽老啦，可是人工太缺，我慢慢和大家变工吧。”而群众却硬要代耕，结果确定全年帮他十五个工。暴家脚荣退军人王云棚、张小考虽已年纪老，但他们异口同声坚决谢绝了群众代耕，村上人说：“老王、老张真好，咱帮助他还不用哩，就那吧，以后可还得照顾哩。”东旺荣退军人王有成自愿帮助军属王森堂代耕亩半地，他说：“我本来没有剩余劳力，因今年劳力缺，我起早搭黑挤点工来帮助军属生产。”（杨柯）
