Seeing the Play "Wang Keqin Squad"
    Squad Leaders Must Learn
    After the First Company of the Fourth Detachment of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region Direct Troops watched the cultural troupe perform "Wang Keqin Squad," the company held a squad leader symposium, mainly to conduct self-reflection and learn from Wang Keqin's good style. Everyone was asked to prepare in advance before the meeting was convened for discussion. At the meeting, Squad Leader Wu Zhenhua of the Fourth Squad first reflected on his insufficient exemplary role. He said, "While marching in × County, we walked all night without rest, and then took the wrong road in the morning, so I was very unhappy. I fell behind and said a lot of strange things." Reflecting on his bad temper, he said, "When the team is assembling, if someone needs to defecate, I would lecture him for half a day, which is really wrong. After seeing the play about Wang Keqin this time, I really learned a great lesson." Then, Squad Leader Shi Ziming of the Second Squad said, "After seeing Wang Keqin's many advantages, we have too many shortcomings. When we see a sick soldier in the squad, we get irritated." In their speeches, everyone admired Wang Keqin's thorough management and good explanation work. Everyone deeply felt that Bai Zhixue's words in the play were right: the squad leader (Wang Keqin) is truly a good manager. Jing Shirong, Squad Leader of the Ninth Squad, said, "Wang Keqin is attentive, communicative, and does what he says, and is considerate in every way." He also said, "We don't explain anything when we do things, we just say 'Quick! Do it quickly!' or 'Keep up! Follow closely!' That's it, we don't explain the problem like Wang Keqin did to Bai Zhixue." Guo Zailin, Squad Leader of the Seventh Squad, felt that mutual assistance was important. He said, "In the past, I always thought that when you're a soldier, everyone takes care of their own business. Each person carries their own things when marching, and I didn't think mutual assistance was important, so it was difficult to manage the squad well." Other squad leaders reflected and said, "Sometimes when we encounter difficulties, before the soldiers even complain, we first lose our temper. We are not as good as the soldiers, let alone Wang Keqin." While reflecting, some people also raised questions, such as Squad Leader Song of the Fifth Squad who said, "Can you get things done by just saying nice things as a squad leader?" After everyone's discussion, they believed that it is necessary to first clarify the ideology in everything. Finally, they discussed the company's mutual aid organization, and everyone thought that there were shortcomings (such as mutual aid group leaders being concurrently held by squad leaders, deputy squad leaders, and team leaders). They said that Wang Keqin's method was good—soldiers find their own mutual aid partners, and mutual aid group leaders are democratically elected. Therefore, according to everyone's opinions, they prepared to rebuild the mutual aid groups, launch a mutual assistance and mutual learning movement, and create a "Wang Keqin Squad." (Hu Bosheng)
    Soldiers Must Also Learn
    After the "Wang Keqin Squad," jointly written and directed by the Military Region Cultural Troupe and a certain unit's cultural team, was performed, the 100th Troops immediately discussed it.
    Yang Fuqiang of the First Squad of the Fourth Company, talking about how the squad leader helped him make his quilt, gave him money to buy cigarettes, and didn't eat the meat himself but let everyone else eat it, said, "Why does the squad leader do this? It's all for our sake." Li Qingzhi of the Fourth Squad said, "I am worried because I am slow-witted, but Squad Leader Yue Kaide has constantly helped me, and now my morale is very high. This is mainly because the squad leader is good to me, and the squad leader is as concerned about us as the squad leader in the play." Soldier Wang Jinxiao of the Fourth Squad, in the past, had the idea of running away. Although he had been educated by his superiors; later, he saw that those who had run away had returned to the team, and the care shown by his superiors during the formation of the team, etc., made him hesitate, but the overcoming of this thinking was largely due to the education given by "Wang Keqin Squad." Wang Jingen's thinking wavered because he was not used to the life. His ideological transformation was due to the squad leader drawing water and letting him drink it first. He realized the care that the cadres had for him, so after seeing the play, he dispelled the idea of going home and said, "Now my thinking is good, mainly because the squad leader taught me well." Many new soldiers felt that Bai Zhixue eventually became a combat hero, and that they also came with red silk and ribbons, determined to catch up with him. After seeing "Wang Keqin Squad," the masses raised these issues, and everyone felt that their company could also produce a "Wang Keqin." At the discussion, some squad and platoon cadres also used Wang Keqin to examine themselves.
    The squad and platoon cadres of the Fifth Company all felt that "they are too poor in taking care of the sick in the squad, in mutual solidarity and love, and in management and education. In the future, they must learn from Wang Keqin." Yue Kaide, the Squad Leader of the Fourth Squad of the Fourth Company, reviewed his three months of work, feeling that he was lazy, lacked solidarity and friendship, and spoke poorly, and that he should learn from Wang Keqin to care for everyone. Wang Zhiren, the Squad Leader of the First Squad, said, "Since I came to the First Squad, I have taken too little care of everyone. The exemplary squad leader in the play gave me a stimulus. In the future, I must care about my comrades." Among the soldiers of the Fifth Company, there were individuals who were not in high spirits, lying on the kang when they returned from training. After seeing the play, they figured it out and wanted to work hard. After seeing the play, many comrades automatically cared about the sick. Everyone's morale is very high, the work has begun to change, and the relationship between officers and soldiers is also closer than before. (Tan Beide)

　　看了《王克勤班》的戏
    班长们要学
    晋冀鲁豫军区直属队四大队一连看了文工团演出的《王克勤班》之后，连里便召开了一个班长座谈会，主要是进行反省，学习王克勤的好作风。事前先叫大家做了一下准备，便开会讨论，会上首先是四班长武振华同志反省自己模范作用不够。他说：“在×县行军时，走了整整一夜，没休息，天明又走错路，所以我很不高兴，自己掉了队，还说了许多怪话。”反省到自己的脾气坏，他说：“队伍集合时，如果有人要大便，我就得训他半天，真不对。这回看了王克勤的戏，真是上了一大课。”接着，二班长石子明同志说：“看了王克勤的许多优点，咱的缺点太多了，看见班里有了病号，就要发燥。”发言中，大家都佩服王克勤管理周到，平时解释工作好，大家深深觉得剧中白志学的话说得对：班长（王克勤）真是个好当家的。九班长荆世荣说：“人家王克勤是眼到、口到、做得到，处处周到。”又说：“咱们干什么事情不会解释，总是快！快干！或是跟上！紧跟上！就算了，没有像王克勤给白志学讲道理一样的去解释问题。”七班长郭载林觉得互助要紧。他说：“以前我总认为当兵么，就是各管各，行军各人背各人的东西，不觉得互助要紧，所以班里也难搞好。”另外几个班长反省说：“有时碰到困难，战士还没哼气，咱首先就发了一顿脾气，咱都比不上战士，更比不上王克勤。”一面进行反省，一面又有人提出些问题，如五班宋班长说：“当班长光说好话能办事吗？”经大家研究，认为什么事尽先弄通思想是应该的。最后，研究了本连的互助组织，大家认为有缺点（如互助组长都是由班长副班长小组长兼任），说王克勤的办法好——由战士自己找互助对象，民主选出互助小组长。于是就根据大家的意见，准备重新建设互助组，展开互助互学运动，创造“王克勤班。”（胡波生）
    战士也要学
    军区文工团和某部文工队联合编导的《王克勤班》演出后，一○○部队即加以讨论。
    四连一班杨富强同志谈到班长帮他作被子，拿钱给买烟，肉少了自己不吃，让大家吃的事情说：“班长为的啥？就是为的我们大家。”四班李清志说：“我心笨就发愁，班长岳开德同志不断的帮助，现在情绪很高。这主要是班长对我好，班长和戏里那个班长一样关心咱们。”四班战士如王金小同志，在以前有心想跑，虽然经过上级的教育；后来又看到跑了的归了队，编队时上级的照顾等等原因，使他犹豫，但这种思想的克服，是《王克勤班》给以很大的教育的。王金根同志就因为生活不惯，思想动摇，他的思想转变是班长打水，先给他喝，他体会到干部对自己的关心，所以看戏后，就打消了回家思想，并且说：“现在我思想好，主要是班长教我好。”好些新战士感到白志学终归成为战斗英雄，自己也是披红挂绸来的，决心要好好的赶上他。看了《王克勤班》之后，群众把这些事提出来了，大家觉得自己连里也能出“王克勤”的。在讨论会上，一些班排干部，也拿王克勤来检讨自己。
    五连班排干部都感到“对班里病员招呼上，互相团结友爱上，管理教育上太差了，今后要向王克勤学习。”四连四班长岳开德把三个月工作作了检讨，觉得自己偷懒，团结友爱差，说话不好，要学王克勤关心大家。一班长王治仁说：“我自来一班里，对大家照顾太差了，戏演的模范班长给我一个刺激，以后我对同志们一定要关心。”五连战士中，有个别人情绪不高，出操回来就躺在炕上，看戏以后想开了要好好的干。许多同志看戏以后，自动的对病员关了心。大家情绪很高，工作已经开始转变，官兵关系也比以前密切了。（谈倍德）
