　　Xiyang Over Ten Thousand Auxiliary Laborers Participate in Mutual Aid to Cooperatively Sow Seeds
　　[This Newspaper's Report] Xiyang's spring plowing and sowing have entered a high tide, with over 11,000 auxiliary laborers involved in the movement. In Xingdanyu Village, First District, after the combatant laborers left, more than ten old men were organized to plow the land, and eighty women and children carried manure, carrying out over four hundred loads in seven days. Jinggou, after finishing delivering manure, formulated a sowing plan, and auxiliary laborers were involved in sowing, raking stones, and weeding. They aimed to complete sowing five days before Grain Full, and in the last two days, they have already sown over 150 mu, and are engaging in challenge competitions, with very high morale. In the Second District, 272 women and children participated in production, delivering a total of 4,179 loads of manure with livestock in three days. The reasons for the district's mobilization: 1. After accurate calculations, they recognized the difficulties under the circumstances of a large number of laborers participating in the war. 2. Cadres personally took action, participated in production, and led the masses. 3. After taking action, cadres specifically divided labor, arranged for district leaders to supervise, and good deeds were broadcasted and praised, so the enthusiasm was very high. Dongzhai women, without hindering production, also made 288 pairs of military shoes and ground over 2,570 jin of wheat. Eighty children in Dongfengren organized ten groups, helping to lead livestock, pinch seeds, and spread manure during sowing, and carrying 191 loads of water for the families of military members and combatants. In the Fourth District, each village established a production committee, established responsibility areas, cadres divided the leadership, and loudly proposed a meritorious service movement on the production front among the masses, so spring plowing and sowing formed a movement, and twenty-two villages in the entire district have begun sowing. The Sixth District plans to complete sowing five days before Grain Full. Incomplete statistics from the second, fourth, fifth, and sixth districts, and nine villages in the first and third districts: over 11,108 auxiliary laborers participated in spring plowing and sowing, and everyone was in high spirits, striving to complete sowing ahead of schedule.

　　昔阳万余辅助劳力参加互助协力播种
    【本报讯】昔阳春耕下种进入高潮，卷入运动的辅助劳力达一万一千余人。一区杏丹峪村在参战劳力走后，即组织了十几个老汉耕地，八十个妇女儿童抬粪，七天抬出四百余担。井沟在送完粪后，订了下种计划，辅助劳力卷入了下种、耙石头、锄草，要在小满前五天完成下种，在最近两天内已下种一百五十余亩，并进行挑战竞赛，情绪非常高涨。二区洪水妇女儿童参加生产的达二百七十二人，三天内连牲口共送出粪四千一百七十九担。该区动起来的原因：１、经过了精确计算，认识了在大批劳力参战的情况下的困难。２、干部亲自动手，参加生产，带领群众。３、在行动起来以后，干部具体分工，按排区领导督促，好的进行了广播表扬，所以劲头很大。东寨妇女在不妨碍生产情况下，还作起军鞋二百八十八双，磨麦二千五百七十余斤。东丰稔儿童八十人组织了十个小组，在下种时帮助牵牲口，捏籽撒粪，并给军属参战人员家属抬水一百九十一担。四区各村都成立了生产委员会，建立了责任区，干部分工领导，在群众中响亮的提出了生产战线上的立功运动，所以春耕下种形成运动，全区已有二十二个村开始下种。六区计划在小满前五天完成下种。全县二、四、五、六区及一、三区九个村不完全统计：参加春耕下种之辅助劳力达一万一千一百零八人，大家情绪很高，争取提前完成下种。
