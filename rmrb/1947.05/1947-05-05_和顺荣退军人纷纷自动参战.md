　　Retired Veterans in Heshun Voluntarily Enlist
    [Our Newspaper Heshun News] After receiving the order to join the war on the 16th of this month, various places actively prepared to join the war and rushed to plant seeds; under these circumstances, retired veterans voluntarily signed up to join the war. For example, Liu Chengnu and Xing Qiang, retired veterans from the Second District, competed to join the war; Han Hailin, Zhao Deyao, Fan Shangzhong, and other five comrades, honorary veterans from Qingjiazhai in the Fourth District, voluntarily proposed not to have the masses cultivate their land on their behalf in order to save civilian labor and support the front line during the war, and said: "You go to join the war! Although my arm cannot move, I am a person with a happy spirit, and now I should work hard to support the front line." Du Su, a retired soldier from Songyan in the Third District, voluntarily signed up to join the war, and said: "I didn't make any contributions on the front line, so this time I will go to the front to make contributions again. If I don't kill a few enemies as a leader of the militia, I will not come back." The masses proposed, "You go to join the war, and we will cultivate your land well on your behalf." (Qiming)

　　和顺荣退军人纷纷自动参战
    【本报和顺讯】本月十六号接到参战的命令后，各地积极准备参战，并突击下种；在这一情况下，荣退军人都自动的报名参战。如二区荣退军人刘成牛和邢强的争着去参战；四区青家寨荣誉军人韩海林、赵德耀、樊尚忠等五同志，因在参战时期，为了节约民力支援前线，自动提出不用群众代耕，并说：“你们去参战吧！虽然我胳膊不能动，但我是人得喜事精神高，现在应来努一把劲，支援前线。”三区松烟退伍军人杜素小，自动报名去参战，并说：“我在前线没有立了功，这次要到前方重来立功，领导民兵非杀他几个敌人不行，立不上功我决不回来。”群众提出“你们去参战，我们给你们好好的代耕。”（启明）
