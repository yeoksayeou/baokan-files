　　Not Afraid of Bandits and Secret Agents, Resolutely Mobilizing the Masses
　　Tangyin New District Opens Up
　　[This Newspaper, Tangyin News] Starting with resolving the ideological problems of cadres, the Tangyang Road East New District has achieved a breakthrough. Initially, cadres transferred to work in the New District had fears, believing that there were many bandits, many secret agents, and many secret societies in the area; they also lacked sufficient understanding of their own strength. They were afraid of being shot at from the shadows. During discussions, everyone gradually clarified the following ideas:
　　First, if we are timid and hesitant, the masses will not dare to approach us, and therefore work in some areas cannot be launched in a timely manner, and some bad elements will still be rampant for a while. The masses have an urgent desire for revenge. If we can stand up for the masses, when the masses rise up, the reactionary forces will not be scary. Second, only through struggle can black guns be eliminated. Black gunners are poor, vagrant elements driven by bullies and landlords. If we adopt correct policies towards them, they will change. The most proactive way to eliminate black guns is to mobilize the masses and arm the masses to confront black guns with rifles. Fear will only fuel the ferocity of landlords and secret agents. Third, we should not use the excuse of raising vigilance to shrink back. Vigilance is active and cautious, doing things better. Overly exaggerating the enemy's strength and binding our feet will cause a lot of losses to our work. After the discussion, everyone's mood changed. Two comrades from Lin County Normal School stayed in Daqingshan Village, where others dared not go, for three or four days and completed the task of borrowing grain. Everyone's confidence in carrying out work improved, and they quickly found a way to get started. Six or seven villages in the Fifth, Seventh, and Eighth Districts have launched struggles. The majority of the remaining villages are brewing and colluding, preparing for struggle. The fear has turned into a surge of struggle. (Shi Hong, Zhang Jie)

　　不怕土匪特务坚决发动群众
  　汤阴新区打开局面
    【本报汤阴讯】从解决干部思想入手，汤阳路东新区打开局面。起初调赴新区工作的干部有畏惧思想，认为当地土匪多、特务多、会门多；而对自己力量缺乏足够的认识：怕打黑枪，讨论中大家逐步明确了以下观念：
    第一、自己畏首畏尾，群众便不敢接近我们，因此某些地方工作便不能及时打开局面，某些坏分子仍能猖獗一时，群众有急切的复仇要求，如果我们能给群众作主，群众起来了，反动势力就不可怕了。第二、只有斗争，才能消灭黑枪。黑枪手是被恶霸、地主所驱使的一些贫苦游民分子，我们对他们采取正确的政策，他们就会转变。消灭黑枪最积极的办法是：发动群众，武装群众以明枪对付黑枪，恐惧只能助长地主、特务的凶焰。第三、不应借口提高警惕性而畏缩不前，警惕性是积极的、是谨慎小心，把事情做的更好，过分夸大敌人力量而裹脚不前，就会使工作遭受不少损失。讨论后，大家情绪转变了，有林县师范两个同志，他们在别人不敢去的大青山村住了三、四天，完成借粮任务。大家开展工作信心提高，工作很快找到了门路；五、七、八区有六、七个村子开展了斗争，其余多数村子，正在酝酿串通，准备斗争，恐惧情绪一转而为斗争的热潮了。（史洪、张捷）
