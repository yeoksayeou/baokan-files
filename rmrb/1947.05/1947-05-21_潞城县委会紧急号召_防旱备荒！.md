　　Lu Cheng County Committee Issues Emergency Call
    Prevent Drought and Prepare for Famine!
    [Reported by this newspaper] The Lu Cheng County Committee issued an emergency call to the entire county to prevent drought, plant seeds, and prepare for famine, stating: "The drought continues without rain, causing a spring drought. The spring wind scrapes the land bare, drying it out an inch each day. If seeds are not sown in the spring, there will be starvation in the autumn; a wife may be childless her whole life, and if seeds are not sown well, the whole year will be in vain." Recalling our experience in fighting the drought in 1943, we believe that humans can conquer nature. Taking advantage of the remaining arable land, men and women, young and old, must act together, engage in large-scale labor exchange and mutual assistance, and rush to sow seeds to fight the spring drought. Villages near the Zhang River should repair the canals, calculate precisely, and irrigate the land day and night, striving not to waste a single drop of water. The fourth district, including Gu Zhang, should vigorously engage in mutual assistance, set up waterwheels, and irrigate the land in shifts. Some areas in the fifth district are relatively damp and should also seize the time to rush to sow seeds. Other dry land should be watered by carrying water to plant seeds, especially cotton, which is even more urgent. All schools should give older children leave to go home and sow seeds, and all businesses, except for those who remain to operate the business, should mobilize to go home and sow seeds. All government agencies and organizations should organize manpower and animal power to help the masses rush to sow seeds. All types of people must seize the season and engage in shock competitions to establish merit during sowing, overcoming the passive mindset of waiting and not caring about what happens to others. On the other hand, we must practice frugality and prepare for famine, overcoming the mindset of wastefulness, excessive eating and drinking. (Lu Cheng Small Newspaper)

　　潞城县委会紧急号召
    防旱备荒！
    【本报讯】潞城县委会向全县发出紧急防旱点种备荒号召称：天旱不雨，造成春旱，更加春风刮地皮一天干一指，春天不种籽，秋后饿个死，说不好媳妇一辈光，种不好籽一年光；回想我们四三年向旱灾作斗争的经验，人定胜天，乘着现在还有些垧土，男女老少一齐动手，大变工大互助，突击下种向春旱作斗争。靠近漳河沿岸的村庄，把水渠修理好，精确计算，白天黑夜浇地，务求不浪费一点水。四区故漳一带应大力互助，把水车按起来，轮流浇地；五区有些地区比较下湿，也应抓紧时间突击下种，其他旱地应担水点种，特别是棉花更不容缓。各学校要将大儿童放假回家下种，各商号要除留下营业的人都动员回家下种，各机关团体尽量组织人、畜力帮助群众突击下种，各种人都要抓紧季节，在下种时要突击竞赛立功，克服等待与事不关己高高挂起的消极思想。另一方面要实行节约备荒，克服浪费、大吃大喝的思想。（潞城小报）
