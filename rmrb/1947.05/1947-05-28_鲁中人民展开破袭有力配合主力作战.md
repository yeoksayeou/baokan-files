Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 26th. Before and after the Chiang Kai-shek army launched a large-scale concentrated offensive on Lu Zhong, the broad masses of militiamen and guerrillas in the Yi (Shui) Meng (Yin) and Mount Tai areas used a combination of sabotage, explosions, shooting, and encirclement guerrilla warfare to protect their fields and homes, providing powerful cooperation to the field army. When the Chiang Kai-shek army first invaded Lu Zhong, 100,000 people in Laiwu County launched seven days and nights of continuous large-scale sabotage, combining sabotage with landmines to create conditions for the main force to annihilate the enemy. More than 60 explosion teams trained and compiled by the military region's armed forces department have gone to the front to assist in the battle. Under the slogan "Farmers all over the world are one family, our enemy is the same," in recent months, tens of thousands of militiamen and guerrillas in the central area have either guarded the periphery or gone to the Chiang Kai-shek occupied areas to assist in the battle. Yi Nan's Gao Yuncheng and Jin Weisan explosion guerrilla teams not only blew up the Jiaoji Railway line in Lu Zhong but also went to Lu Nan and other places to fight. During the Laiwu Campaign, in that county, only old men, women, and children captured 90 prisoners, seized a small cannon, a machine gun, and 30 rifles using sticks, stones, hand grenades, and shouting. With the masses' conscious enthusiasm for participating in the war, new guerrilla tactics have been created. Such as (1) Confusion Formation. On March 26, the enemy commando team that was "suppressing" Renyi Village in Taining was repelled by the village militia's confusion formation. When the enemy was about to enter the village, gunfire broke out in the village, and gunshots, horns, and shouts sounded from all directions at the same time. The enemy was in chaos for a while, mistaking it for being surrounded, and then fled in panic. (2) Chain Trap. After two Chiang Kai-shek soldiers were killed by a landmine while looting grain in Shiza of Taining, the enemy company commander immediately fled to the woods to hide. Suddenly, another landmine was triggered, and two Chiang Kai-shek soldiers were killed. (3) Combination of Mine and Gun, Luring the Tiger Away from the Mountain. When the enemy entered Laiwu, landmines were everywhere, and the enemy dared not move easily. The Wang Aishan explosion team went to the gate of the Dazhaizi stronghold to shoot and attack the enemy. When the enemy came out to chase, they lured them into the landmine network. In addition, such as "Iron Cat Watching the Mountain" and "Willow Tree Blocking the Road," on the mountain slopes and small ridges where landmines could not be buried, obstacles were created with stones and branches on the road, and iron cat mines and branch mines were scattered among them, making it impossible for enemy vehicles to pass. When the enemy went to remove them, they could not escape the fate of "sitting on a plane." Li Xueshou of Miaoshan District in Laiwu bombed more than a dozen enemy vehicles three times in three days, preventing the enemy from advancing easily for eight hours.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 26th. After the Chiang Kai-shek army re-occupied Laiwu on the 10th of this month, more than 700 county and district cadres poured into the armed work teams, leading thousands of young men to persist in fighting in the original place. The director of the county government's public security bureau, the head of the county party committee's organization department, and the armed forces minister all personally led the militia and guerrillas to attack the enemy. When the enemy stepped into the territory of Laiwu, the local armed forces in Wennan District took the lead in blocking the enemy, covering the transfer of the masses. The Yanzhuang armed work team killed dozens of enemies with 15 bombs and landmines on the 5th. When the district chief and the armed forces minister encountered elderly people in various villages who could not evacuate when the enemy sneaked back to the top of the mountain at night. From the 7th to the 12th, in six days, the local armed forces fought 15 times on both sides of the Wenhe River in the Penghua Mountain area, detonating more than 40 landmines and injuring more than 100 enemies. Forcing the enemy to camp on the mountain, and every time they acted, they had to search with plainclothes teams first before the main force dared to advance. It took three days for the enemy to travel less than 30 miles from Li Tiaozhuang to Laiwu City.

　　鲁中人民展开破袭有力配合主力作战
    【新华社山东二十六日电】蒋军大举向鲁中作重点进攻之前后，沂（水）蒙（阴）、泰山山区广大民兵游击队，利用破袭爆炸射击围困相结合的游击战争，保田保家予野战军以有力配合。当蒋军第一次进犯鲁中时，莱芜县十万人展开连续七昼夜大破袭，复以破袭与地雷相结合，到处破路埋雷，造成主力歼敌有力条件。军区武装部训编之六十余爆炸队，已开赴前线助战。在“天下农民是一家，咱们的敌人是一个”的口号下，几个月来，中心区数万民兵游击队，或在边缘看大门，或到蒋占区助战，沂南高运成、金维三爆炸游击队不仅炸遍鲁中胶济沿线，且开赴鲁南等地作战。莱芜战役中，该县仅老头妇女儿童用木棍石头手榴弹喊话即捉俘虏九十名，缴小炮一门，机枪一挺，步枪三十枝。在群众自觉的参战热情下，并创造出新的游击战术。如（一）迷惑阵。三月二十六日，“清剿”泰宁仁义庄之敌突击队，即被该村民兵迷惑阵击退，敌正欲进庄时，村内枪声大作，同时四面枪声号声喊声齐发，敌一时混乱，误为被包围，随即仓惶逃走。（二）连环套。向泰宁石砸抢粮蒋军被一个地雷炸死两名后，敌连长立即逃到树林隐蔽，忽又触雷，两名蒋军被炸毙。（三）雷枪结合，调虎离山。当敌进莱芜时，遍地地雷，敌不敢轻易出动。王爱山爆炸队即到大寨子据点门前打枪袭敌。敌人出追，便诱其进入地雷网。此外，如“铁猫看山”“柳树拦路”，在不能埋雷的山坡小岭的公路上，用石头及树枝造成障碍物，将铁猫雷与树枝雷散布其中，使敌汽车不能通行。当敌人去铲除时，即无法逃避“坐飞机”命运。莱芜苗山区李学收在三天内三次炸敌汽车十余辆，阻敌在八小时内不敢轻易行进。
    【新华社山东二十六日电】蒋军与本月十日再度侵占莱芜后，该县七百余县区干部均涌入武工队，带领数千青壮年坚持原地斗争。县府公安局长、县委组织部长、武装部长等，均亲率民兵游击队击敌人。当敌人踏入莱芜境时，汶南区地方武装首起阻击，掩护群众转移。颜庄武工队五日的炸弹地雷十五枚，毙敌数十名。该区区长及武装部长于夜间乘敌窜回山顶时，遇到各村抚慰不能撤走的老年群众。自七日至十二日六天中，地方武装于蓬花山区汶河两岸即作战十五次，炸雷四十余枚，伤敌百余。迫使敌在山头露营，每逢行动，必先以便衣队搜索，大队始敢行进。由李条庄到莱芜城不足三十里，走三天始到。
