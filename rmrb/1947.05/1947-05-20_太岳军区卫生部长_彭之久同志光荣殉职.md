　　Taiyue Military Region Health Director
    Comrade Peng Zhijiu Dies a Heroic Death
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 18th] Comrade Peng Zhijiu, Director of the Health Department of the Taiyue Military Region (note: Comrade Zhijiu is the younger brother of Peng Xuefeng, the late Division Commander of the New Fourth Army), went to the front lines of southern Shanxi this time to serve the wounded. Unfortunately, on the 28th of last month, he encountered an enemy intelligence group and died a heroic death in a certain area of Xia County. After encountering the enemy, Comrade Zhijiu was very calm. When the enemy rushed forward, he fought them with a pistol. However, due to the disparity in numbers, he died a heroic death. When the sad news arrived, the soldiers and civilians of the entire region mourned together. On the 9th of this month, the Taiyue Regional Party Committee, the Administrative Office, and the Military Region jointly initiated a memorial service. Comrade Guo Qin'an of the Taiyue Regional Party Committee, in great grief and indignation, called on comrades in the health department to cherish the wounded and sick soldiers, strengthen medical work, enable the wounded and sick soldiers to recover as soon as possible, and return to the front line to avenge Director Peng.

　　太岳军区卫生部长
    彭之久同志光荣殉职
    【本报太岳十八日电】太岳军区卫生部长彭之久同志（按之久同志为新四军彭故师长雪枫之弟）此次身临晋南前线，为伤员服务，不幸于上月二十八日在夏县某地与敌谍报组遭遇牺牲。之久同志遇敌后，非常镇定，敌人冲来当以手枪与敌格斗，卒因众寡悬殊，光荣殉职。噩耗传来，全区军民同声痛悼。本月九日太岳区党委、行署、军区发起举行追悼大会。太岳区党委郭钦安同志于万分悲愤中，号召卫生部门同志，爱护伤病员，加强医疗工作，使伤病员早日痊愈，重上前线与彭部长复仇。
