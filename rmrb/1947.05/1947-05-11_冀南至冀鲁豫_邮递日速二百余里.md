　　From Southern Hebei to Hebei-Shandong-Henan
    Postal Delivery Reaches Over 200 Li Per Day
    [Our Newspaper] To strengthen the connection between the front and rear, and to accelerate newspaper distribution, post offices in various regions are actively improving postal routes and increasing speed. In addition to the established military post offices, the Weixian to Guantao section in Southern Hebei has added night shifts, covering over 100 li, with horse-drawn carriages completing the journey overnight. Later, a relay system was implemented for the Guantao-Yanggu section, increasing the daily speed of mail delivery to 210 li, thus shortening the entire journey by two days. Furthermore, automobile services have been added to the Nangong-Hengshui section, which can speed up delivery by one and a half to one day. On all main routes, bicycles are used wherever possible instead of horse-drawn carts, and where horse-drawn carts are feasible, large carts are avoided, striving to increase speed. The daily speed on main routes, whether using non-wheeled vehicles or horses, is consistently between 90 and 100 li, or even more.

　　冀南至冀鲁豫
    邮递日速二百余里
    【本报讯】为密切前后方联系，加速报纸发行，各地邮局纷纷改进邮路，提高速度。除已创立军邮××个外，冀南威县至馆陶段已增设夜班，全长一百余里，马车一夜赶到。后又实行馆（陶）阳（谷）段接力制，邮件日速二百一十里，因此全程缩短两天。此外，南宫、衡水段增设汽车班，速度可加快一天半至一天。各干线凡可走自行车者，一律不用马车，可用马车者，一律不使大车，力求速度之提高。干线日速无轮车、马均在九十至一百甚至百里以上。
