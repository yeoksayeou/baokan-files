　　Zuoquan Fourth District Office
    Donates Rice to Relieve Border Area Masses
    [This newspaper's report from Zuoquan Fourth District] At an emergency mobilization meeting of district and village cadres on the 5th of this month, everyone resolutely responded to Commissioner Fan's emergency call and guaranteed to complete the disaster relief fundraising work within a week. On the morning of the 6th, before the district cadres left (to work in the countryside), Secretary Ma said to everyone, "The six counties of Ping, Shou, Yu, Tai, Qi, etc., have suffered destruction by Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan's puppets, and 30,000 people have nothing to eat. We should set an example and donate some rice first." Everyone immediately agreed. From the district chief down to the cook, except for the district cadres who had left to join the war, 20 people donated a total of 101.5 jin of rice.

　　左权四区区公所
    捐米救济边地群众
    【本报左权四区讯】本月五日在区村干部紧急动员会议中，一致坚决响应樊专员紧急号召，保证一礼拜中完成救灾募捐工作。六日早区干部临走前（下乡工作），马分书对大家说：“平、寿、榆、太、祁等六县遭受蒋阎伪摧残，三万人没有吃的，咱们应该起模范，先捐助一部米。”大家马上赞成，计上自区长下至炊事员，除参战走了的区干部外，二十人共捐米一百零一斤半。
                                                      （伏怀）
