　　Xinhua News Agency, Jinsui, 12th: The Yan army's 72nd Division, 216th Regiment, entrenched in Wenshui city, fearing annihilation by the People's Liberation Army, completely retreated to Jiaocheng on the 7th of this month, and the city was liberated for the third time. Wenshui city was occupied by the Yan army in mid-February.
　　[Special dispatch from this newspaper] The Qi-Tai militia of the Taihang Second Military Sub-district, taking advantage of the enemy's internal weakness, used a miraculous "heart-digging" tactic to raid the enemy guarding Yaocun town in Yuci from Fancun, Taigu on the night of April 6th. Thanks to the bravery and swift action of all our commanders and fighters, they captured all 22 enemies, including the platoon leader, alive within 20 minutes, without a single one escaping. They seized one light machine gun, 19 rifles, more than 500 rounds of ammunition, more than 400 grenades, and some other spoils of war. We suffered only three minor injuries. (Liu Ruzhen)
　　[This newspaper, Taiyue, 12th] Encouraged by the victories on the front lines, the militia in various parts of Taiyue are launching a military training movement. Shimin launched the "Three-Five Movement," cultivating five sharpshooters, five demolition experts, and five grenade throwers in each village. The Fourth District began a 100-person training session on the 16th of last month. After half a month, they learned the tactics of combining thunder and guns, and improved the command ability of cadres. The Fifth District put forward a plan to kill an enemy squad in the military training. The Sixth District, at a meeting of village demolition team leaders, studied a method of using damaged Hanyang-made grenade burst tubes to modify stone mine burst tubes. According to experiments, one can create twenty stone mine burst tubes. Villagers and militiamen in Wu Village and Hong Village in Qinyuan are seizing every opportunity to study, whether in the morning or during breaks in the fields, and even practice martial arts under the moonlight at night. The militiamen guarding the river defense in Wangwu are also seizing the time to actively train. Chen Xiaoliu, from the Second District, leads the militia to patrol the riverbank. After patrolling all night, they still participate in military training at dawn. Cook Zhao Fabao has also set out a military training plan and can now throw grenades more than 25 meters.
　　[This newspaper, Taiyue, 12th] After capturing Quwo, the Second Company of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army in Southern Shanxi carried out commendations and rewards, followed by military training. Chang Zhanyun, Zhang Lou, Ma Caishun, and others, who had never liked to study, also automatically started night exercises. Two people act as enemies, and two people search, just like on the battlefield. When Li Baohai was practicing earthwork operations, others could dig a prone firing position, but he could dig a kneeling firing position. He also automatically studies after returning. Now all comrades are gearing up and intensifying their efforts to practice their skills in preparation for winning bigger victories next time.
