Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th. Comprehensive reports: American imperialism is increasingly and openly supporting Germany, Japan, and Spain, which are universally recognized as hotbeds of fascist remnants. According to a Wall Street Journal correspondent in Japan, the US Congress will vote on the issue of granting Japan a huge loan within five years, which may amount to as much as one billion US dollars. Recently, Spanish newspaper editorials and news reports have stated, "The US policy towards Spain has changed." Rumors of loans to Spain have also been rampant. Although the US State Department has stated that "the US has not considered loans to Spain," it has also inadvertently admitted that "private transactions are taking place between American companies and the Spanish government." Everyone knows that the behind-the-scenes bosses of the White House political stage are several large "companies." Under the guise of relieving the German grain shortage, US Secretary of the Army Patterson recently announced that the US will ship 400,000 tons of grain to Germany in May, and will increase the amount monthly thereafter. This is partly to alleviate the deteriorating economic situation of American agriculture, but more importantly, to add reactionary capital for the Nazi reactionaries in the American and British occupied zones of Germany.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th. American imperialism attempts to further control the countries of the Americas through a "plan to standardize the armaments of Western Hemisphere nations." According to the US Information Service in Washington, a State Department spokesman stated on the 22nd that the Secretary of State and the Secretaries of the Army and Navy jointly submitted to Truman a plan to standardize the armaments of Western Hemisphere nations, and urged Truman to immediately request Congress to pass legislation approving this plan. In fact, the so-called "standardization" of armaments in the Western Hemisphere is actually "Americanization." This is closely related to the Pan-American Conference that Marshall is eager to convene, and is a major conspiracy by American imperialism to strengthen its control over Latin American countries and Canada.

　　美扶植法西斯残余贷款给德日西班牙
    【新华社陕北二十日电】综合报导：美帝国主义，对于公认为法西斯残余之渊薮的德、日与西班牙，竟亦日益公开予以扶植。据华尔街日报驻日记者报导：美国会将投票表决于五年内对日作巨额贷款问题，该项贷款，数额可能达十亿美元之多。最近西班牙报纸的社论与消息都说：“美国对西政策业已改变。”对西贷款之说近亦甚嚣尘上。美国务院虽然声明“美未考虑对西贷款”，但却又不打自招的承认“美国公司与西班牙政府间则有私人之交易进行。”谁也知道，白宫政治舞台的后台老板，也就是几个大的“公司”。在救济德国粮荒的幌子下，美陆长柏德逊于最近宣布，五月间美将以粮食四十万吨运往德国，以后还要逐月增加。这一则是为了解救美国农业经济情况的恶化，而更重要的是为德境美英占领区的纳粹反动派们增添一笔反动的资本。
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】美帝国主义图以“西半球国家军备标准化之计划”，更进一步控制美洲各国。据美国新闻处华盛顿讯：美国务院发言人于二十二日声称：国务卿、海陆军部长曾联合向杜鲁门提出一项西半球国家军备标准化之计划，彼等并促杜鲁门即速请求国会通过立法，批准此一计划。事实上，所谓西半球国家军备“标准化”，实际就是“美国化”，此与马歇尔亟谋召开的泛美洲会议有着密切关联，为美帝国主义加强控制拉丁美洲各国及加拿大之重大阴谋。
