Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th: Compiling reports from various sources: Chiang Kai-shek's deception in Taiwan has been completely exposed. The Taiwanese people continue their resistance and struggle under bloody and terroristic suppression. The butcher Chen Yi has been "replaced" by Wei Tao-ming, the former ambassador to the United States for the Chiang government, while the "Executive Governor's Office," which the Taiwanese people deeply resent, has been renamed the "Provincial Government." The so-called "appointment of Taiwanese people" only involves adding a few deputy directors to the provincial government. According to Chiang's spokesperson, their authority "aims to enable them to be proficient in the country's political system and all laws and regulations." Under these cosmetic changes, Chiang Kai-shek's terroristic policies towards the Taiwanese people remain unchanged. According to a TASS report on the 27th: Taiwanese groups in Shanghai have sent a letter to Wei Tao-ming, demanding the immediate cessation of the "mopping-up war" in Taiwan and the cancellation of "martial law," and the permission for newspapers to resume publication and schools to reopen. As for the Taiwanese insurgents who have penetrated the rural areas and mountains, they are still continuing their heroic resistance. Chen Yi, in response to reporters on the 24th, had to admit that the vast rural areas of Taipei are still under the control of the insurgents.

　　台湾人民不受欺骗  坚持农村英勇抗蒋
    【新华社陕北三十日电】综合各方消息：蒋介石在台湾的骗局完全拆穿，台湾人民仍在血腥恐怖镇压之下继续反抗斗争。刽子手陈仪已由蒋政府前驻美大使魏道明“接替”，而台湾人民深恶痛绝的“行政长官公署”则易名为“省政府”。所谓“任用台人”，只是在省政府内增设几名副厅长；而其职权，按照蒋方发言人的说法：“旨在使能娴熟本国政治制度与一切法令规章。”在这些改头换面的装璜下，蒋介石对台湾人民的恐怖政策则原封未动。据塔斯社二十七日电：上海台湾各团体已致书魏道明，要求立即停止台湾之“扫荡战”与取消“戒严法”，准许报纸复刊和学校重开。至于深入农村及山地的台湾起义人民，现则仍在继续英勇反抗；陈仪在二十四日答复记者时，也不得不承认台北广大农村仍在起义人民控制之下。
