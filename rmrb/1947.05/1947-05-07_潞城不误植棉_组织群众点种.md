　　Lucheng Does Not Delay Planting Cotton
    Organizing the Masses to Sow
    [Our Newspaper Lucheng News] It is currently the time for planting cotton, but due to prolonged drought and lack of rain, the land is too dry to plant. The general public is waiting and hoping for rain, feeling helpless. Therefore, Liu Jubao, a top-notch agricultural expert from Nanliu Village, convened a symposium on April 28th for members of the technical committees from various villages in the entire joint defense zone to study techniques for planting cotton during drought conditions. At the meeting, everyone was highly enthusiastic, not only sharing their experiences in planting cotton during drought but also pledging not to reduce the acreage of cotton fields due to the drought, but to maintain the original acreage and even expand it. Several effective methods for planting cotton in dry weather are described below:

    I. Adjusting planting to nearby water sources for watering. Most cotton fields in the villages are far from water sources, making watering a significant challenge. It is best to adjust planting to fields near water sources. If households cannot adjust internally, they can exchange land with other households based on equal yield (equal value). When watering, each mu should use at least twenty buckets of water. The planting method is to first dig a pit, then pour water in, wait for the water to seep in, and then use a hoe to loosen the soil before placing the seeds. If a hoe is not used, rake the soil horizontally and vertically after placing the seeds to avoid the formation of mud clumps.

    II. Planting cotton by piling soil on dry ground. After a long drought, even a brief, light rain is not enough for planting. One can immediately drip cotton seeds on the flat ground and then scrape the surrounding wet soil over the seeds, piling it into a pointed mound. Wait until the seedlings are about to emerge, then remove the tip of the mound to prevent them from being buried too deep.

    III. Planting in low-lying areas. This method is used when the cotton fields were plowed last fall and have not been plowed this spring. The surface soil has dried out, but there is still moisture underneath. At this time, the dry surface soil can be scraped away to expose the wet soil. Then, dig a pit, sow the seeds, and cover them with the wet soil first, followed by the dry soil. When the seedlings are about to emerge, the dry soil on the surface can be scraped away.

    IV. Borrowing soil for planting. This method can be used when there is either moisture underneath but no loose surface soil, or loose surface soil but no moisture underneath. If there is moisture underneath, dig deep and plant shallow, digging up the wet soil and turning the dry soil underneath. When dripping the seeds and covering them, dig soil from elsewhere without dispersing it, and cover the seeds with it, so that both the upper and lower layers are wet soil. If there is loose surface soil but no moisture underneath, the pit should be dug deep. Then, put the wet surface soil into the pit, drip the seeds, and cover them with wet soil, so that both the upper and lower layers are wet soil.

    V. Using seedbeds to raise seedlings for transplanting. This method can reduce the difficulty of watering, allow for timely planting, and allow the seedlings to grow while waiting for rain. Once it rains, they can be transplanted.

        (You Sheng, Jin Xiang, Feng Jun)

    [Another News] The Taihang Third Special Commissioner's Office has circulated the experiences of Ping Shun in planting cotton during drought (the methods are basically the same as above) throughout the special zone, and called on cadres and labor heroes to take the lead in organizing the masses to plant cotton. It also calls for adopting the experience of tree planting, inspecting while planting, and transplanting and replanting if the seedlings are not complete.

　　潞城不误植棉
    组织群众点种
    【本报潞城讯】目前正在棉花下种时候，但因天高无雨，地干种不出来，一般群众都在等待，盼望着下雨，感到别无他法。因此，南流村特等能手刘聚宝为了研究这一技术，解决这一困难，特于上月二十八日召开全联防区各村技委会委员座谈天旱种花经验。在会议上大家情绪很高，不但个个把自己天旱种花经验说出了，而且保证不能因天旱威胁我们少种，要保持原有棉田亩数，甚至扩大。兹将几种旱天种花好办法分述如下：
    一、调剂近水地担水栽种。各村棉田多系离水较远，因此在担水栽花上是很大困难，最好调在近水地种花，如本户调换不转，可实行户与户等产（等价）调换。担水栽时，每亩最少用二十担水即行，栽法是先把坑刨下，然后放水，待水渗下，再用镢掏过放籽，如不用镢掏，放籽后再用耙横顺耙一遍，以免结泥圪瘩。
    二、就垧堆土栽花。久旱无雨，忽然下了一半指雨，仍然是种不出来，可以马上把棉籽滴在平地上，然后把周围的湿土刮过来，把籽堆成尖堆，等待快出土时，将堆尖去掉，以免过深出不来。
    三、趁垧凹栽法。就是去秋垡过的花地，今春又没有犁过，浮面土吹干了，仍有底垧，这时可以把浮面的干土刮开，露出湿土，再刨坑下种后，复土先用湿土，后盖干土，待苗快出土时，可把浮上的干土刮开。
    四、借垧栽花。有底垧没浮垧或有浮垧没底垧，都可以用这种办法。如有底垧可深刨浅栽，把湿土掘起，把干土翻下，滴上籽盖土时，另在别处掘一下，原掘土不散盖上，这样上下都变成湿土了。有浮垧没底垧，坑要刨深，后将浮面湿土放进再滴籽，然后再盖湿土，这样上下也都变成湿土了。
    五、用畦养苗移栽法。这个办法可以减少担水困难，又能按时下种，一面生长，一面等雨，一等有雨即可移栽。

    【另讯】太行三专署特将平顺旱天种棉经验（办法基本同于上法），通报全专区，并号召干部、劳英积极带头，组织群众点种；并接受植树经验，边种边检查，如苗不齐全，要移栽补栽。
