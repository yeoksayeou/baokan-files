　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 20th Urgent Telegram: A unit of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army annihilated two divisions and two regiments of the enemy in the Huai De campaign. When recovering old Huai De on the 17th, they annihilated the 90th Regiment of the 30th Division of the New First Army and the 17th Security Regiment. On the 18th, they continued to encircle and annihilate the enemy reinforcing Huai De, annihilating the 91st Division and the 88th Division of Chiang's 71st Army (Note: The 88th Division was newly formed after being annihilated by our army in the battle northwest of Nong'an this spring after large-scale replenishment). The battle results are continuing to expand.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 20th Urgent Telegram: Gongzhuling, an important town on the Changchun Railway, was recaptured by a certain unit of the Democratic Allied Army on the same day (19th) that it took the initiative to withdraw from the area last year. When the Democratic Allied Army re-entered the city, the masses lined the streets to welcome them, tears welling up in their eyes, tightly grasping the hands of the warriors and saying, "Comrades! We have suffered for a whole year, you have not forgotten us, and you are back today."
　　After Chiang's army was annihilated by our army at Daheilinzi, southeast of Huai De, on the 18th, a small number of remnants fled towards Gongzhuling. The heroic troops of the Democratic Allied Army took advantage of the victory to pursue. Before the enemy could catch their breath, they scattered and retreated, failing to organize any effective resistance, abandoning solid fortifications and bunkers, and fleeing in a panic towards Siping, abandoning countless ammunition, equipment, grain and other materials. In the station alone, 25 train cars fully loaded with ammunition were seized. Note: Gongzhuling is an important stronghold more than 100 li southwest of Changchun, and one of the supply bases for Chiang's army. The area is a small mountainous region, located between the plains of Changchun and Siping, with the Liao River encircling it to the south. The Japanese invaders spent many years developing this area, establishing tank and airplane factories and airfields, surrounded by numerous碉堡, with convenient transportation, and it was an important station in the middle section of the Changchun Railway. After the Siping campaign last year, Chiang's army organized strong forces, attempting to use this as a battle zone to fight a decisive battle with us. After the recapture of Gongzhuling, the trunk line traffic between Changchun and Shenyang has been cut into two sections by us.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Liaodong, 21st: The Liaodong Democratic Allied Army once again shattered Chiang's army's attack, capturing more than a thousand enemies. Since the Democratic Allied Army captured the stations of Shanchengzhen and Caoshi on the Shenyang-Hailong line and annihilated more than 3,000 Chiang's troops (i.e., the previously reported annihilation of two regiments of Chiang's army), Du Yuming mobilized the troops he could mobilize in Liaodong to attack us, including the entire 22nd Division of the New Sixth Army, one of the main forces of Chiang's Northeast Army, the headquarters and two regiments of the Provisional 20th Division of the 13th Army, and one regiment of the 54th Division of the 13th Army, totaling six regiments (equivalent to two divisions). Liao Yaoxiang, the commander of the New Sixth Army, personally directed the attack, under the cover of two American-style airplanes, and set out from Xinbin and Ying'emen (40 li northeast of Qingyuan) on the 15th, launching a three-pronged attack on Nanshanchengzi (70 li south of Shanchengzhen and east of Qingyuan City). At 5 p.m. on the 16th, the Liaodong Democratic Allied Army bravely counterattacked, and the artillery fire from both sides was extremely fierce. After a fierce battle until the afternoon of the 17th, we completely defeated the invading enemy. The enemy scattered and fled in extreme disarray. Their tanks, ammunition, heavy weapons, baggage and other equipment were scattered all over the ground. As of the time of the telegram, we had captured more than 1,000 men from the 22nd Division of Chiang's army, and are currently pursuing them to expand the battle results. (Attached picture)

　　西满我军歼敌两师
    攻克公主岭斩断中长路         
    辽东击溃蒋军两师进犯俘敌千余
    【新华社东北二十日急电】东北民主联军一部，于怀德战役中，歼敌两师零两团。十七日收复旧怀德时，歼敌新一军三十师九十团及保安十七团。十八日，继续围歼增援怀德之敌，歼蒋军七十一军九十一师及八十八师（按八十八师系今春于农安西北之役中被我歼灭后，大肆补充而新组成者）。战果正在继续扩展中。
    【新华社东北二十日急电】中长路上之重镇公主岭，已为民主联军某部于去年主动撤离该地之同日（十九日）一举收复。当民主联军重入该城时，群众夹道欢迎，热泪夺眶，紧握勇士们的手说：“同志们！我们受了整整一年的罪，你们没有忘记我们，今天又回来了。”
    蒋军于十八日在怀德东南之大黑林子被我军歼灭后，其少数残部溃向公主岭，民主联军英雄部队乘胜追击，敌喘息未定，散乱溃退，未能组织任何有效之抵抗，即放弃坚固工事及地堡，狼狈向四平方面逃窜，遗弃弹药、器材、粮食等物资无算。仅在车站一处，即缴获满载弹药之车皮二十五个。按：公主岭系长春西南百余里之重要据点，蒋军兵站补给基地之一，该地乃小山区，位于长春、四平两处平原之间，南有辽河环带，日寇曾以大力在此经营多年，设有坦克、飞机制造厂与飞机场，周围碉堡林立，交通便利，为中长路中段之重要车站。去年四平战役以后，蒋军曾组织强大兵力，妄图以此为与我决战地带。公主岭收复后，长、沈间干线交通，已被我截成两段。
    【新华社辽东二十一日电】辽东民主联军再度粉碎蒋军进攻，俘敌千余。自民主联军攻克沈（阳）海（龙）线上之山城镇、草市等车站歼蒋军三千余人（即前报导之歼蒋军两个团）后，杜聿明复动员其在辽东可能调动之部队，向我进攻，计有东北蒋军主力之一的新六军二十二师全部，十三军暂二十师师部及两个团，十三军五十四师一个团共六个团（计两个师）的兵力。新六军军长廖原湘亲自指挥，在两架美式飞机掩护下，分由新宾及英额门（清原东北四十里）出动，十五日分三路向南山城子（在山城镇之南、清原城以东七十里）进攻。十六日下午五时，辽东民主联军奋勇反击，双方炮火至为猛烈，激战至十七日下午，我将进犯之敌全部击溃，敌四散逃窜，状极狼狈。其坦克、弹药、重武器、辎重等，遗弃遍地；至发电时止，我已俘掳蒋军二十二师千余人，刻正跟踪追击，扩大战果中。（附图片）
