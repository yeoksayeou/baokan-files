Left-wing Seventh District Farmers Universally Participate in Mutual Aid
	Rushing to Plant 1,300 Mu of Land
	[Report from the newspaper's Left-wing correspondent] After the county's production mobilization meeting, the production work in the Seventh District has achieved significant results in the ten days from the 20th to the end of last month. Of the 2,688 households in the district, 99.1% are organized, with only 79 households not participating in mutual aid. Of the district's more than 3,000 mu of land, about 40% has now been sown. The main reasons why the district was able to achieve the above results in a short period of time, especially after completing successive war support tasks, are:

	Combining Spring Plowing and Equitable Land Distribution Greatly Increases Enthusiasm for Production
	1. In terms of methods, different villages adopted different approaches. The district can be roughly divided into three types of villages: First, five villages where the distribution of harvest was unfair, hindering mutual aid in production. For example, in Sucheng Village, most of the farmers who were enlightened last year dared to express their opinions during the distribution of harvest. Because the leadership understood their situation, they were allocated relatively satisfactory harvests. However, there were still a few unawakened, honest farmers who did not speak at meetings and did not stand out in ordinary times. They were overlooked during the distribution of harvest. When the village cadres returned from the county meeting to resolve the masses' fear of getting rich, the masses did not mention getting rich or not, but kept complaining about the unfair distribution of harvest. For example, Liu Fulin from the village said, "I want to get rich but can't, there are too many people and the land is bad, there's no fundamental solution." When the leadership discovered this problem, they immediately conducted a thorough investigation. As a result, it was found that a poor household that had just moved in had not been allocated any land at all; four poor farmer households had only been allocated some inferior land. At that time, because it was during a rush to sow, in addition to filling the pits that had been discovered, the examination of harvest is currently being continued. Then, at the village's mass production mobilization meeting, the masses were in high spirits, and 94% participated in mutual aid. The second type of village is where the relationship between cadres and the masses was not straightened out, totaling eight villages. For example, the cadres of Yuanzhuang Village were discouraged and boasted about their achievements. The masses regretted expressing their opinions and feared retaliation. The relationship between the two sides was very strained. Under the leadership's active encouragement of the production enthusiasm of cadres and the masses, on the one hand, they combined reviewing mutual aid with reviewing the relationship between cadres and the masses, and on the other hand, they rushed to sow. Now the relationship between cadres and the masses has gradually improved. The third type of village is where the cadres have been reformed and can unite the masses. In some villages, old cadres were promoted and new cadres took over, and they had great enthusiasm for leading production. Production work proceeded smoothly, and significant achievements were made in rushing to sow.

	2. In accordance with the government's decree protecting farmers' property rights, repeatedly explain: "Exploitation will not take away labor." And emphasizing, "Everyone should get rich together, even lazy people have to get rich, everyone has to work together, even those who don't want to have to work." Also, people such as Zhao Yinshun and Yang Mancang from Sucheng Village overcame the thought of getting rich, they automatically proposed resolving the issues and establishing a mediation committee to solve problems and work in peace. Although the fear of getting rich has not been completely resolved, the masses have a preliminary concept of getting rich.

	3. Seize the time to encourage the masses to rush to sow. When the leadership proposed to rush to sow, the masses in Nanye resisted the idea and were unwilling to sow. They said: "A busy time during Little Fullness is worth two normal times." The leadership, in response to this idea, proposed "A busy time during Little Fullness is worth as much as if you are late, but you can replant." Later, during successive war support tasks, not only did they not slacken, but on the contrary, they further urged the sowing, and the whole village took action.

	The current problems are: First, some households in many villages have not settled their mutual aid accounts for several years. Nanye Village underreported nine head of cattle when reporting the number of cattle in other villages. The reason was that the district transferred cattle to Weize last year, but they have not been compensated to this day, so they are afraid of being transferred again, hence the underreporting. For example, Wang Quanzi from Sucheng Village worked for seven days for village cadre He Xianrong two years ago and has never been paid. Second, the harvest has not been cleared in general, and the masses demand it be cleared, but time does not allow it. Third, a large number of village women have still not fully participated in labor, and currently 68% of the labor force in the district is participating in war support. Based on this situation, the following decisions are made: In the next ten days, continue to rush to sow. All workers, students, women, and merchants in the district must participate in sowing, and ensure that sowing is prioritized for war support personnel and military families.

### 左权七区农民普遍参加互助  突击种地千三百亩

　　左权七区农民普遍参加互助
    突击种地千三百亩
    【本报左权讯】县生产动员大会后，从上月二十日至上月底十天中，七区生产工作已获显著成绩。全区二千六百八十八户，百分之九十九点一都组织起来了，只剩七十九户未参加互助。全区土地三千余亩，现已下种的约占百分之四十。该区能在短时间内，特别是在一连完成参战任务的情况下能取得以上成绩，主要原因是：
    结合春耕分匀土地  生产热情大大提高
    一、在作法上，不同村庄采取了不同方法，全区大致可分三种村：第一果实不公，障碍生产互助的五个村。如粟城村去年分果实时大部分觉悟了的农民敢提意见，由于领导上了解了他的情况，便给他分到比较满意的果实。但还有少数不觉悟的老实农民，开会不发言，平素表现不突出，分果实时便将他遗漏了，当村干部从县里开会回来解决群众怕发财思想时，群众不提发家不发家，老是吵着果实不公问题。如该村刘福林说：“我是想发财发不了财，人多地坏没根本。”当领导上发现这个问题后，随即普遍深入检查。结果查出一户新安家的赤贫根本没分到土地；四户贫农仅分到些劣地，当时因正突击下种，除将已发现的圪洞予以填补，现正在继续公布检查果实。接着在全村群众生产动员大会上，群众情绪很高，百分之九十四参加了互助。第二类村是干群关系没整通，共有八个村。如原庄村干部消沉，摆功劳，群众后悔提了意见；怕报复，双方关系极不容洽，在领导上积极鼓舞干群生产情绪下，一方面连系检讨互助进行检讨干群关系，一方面突击下种，现干部与群众关系已逐渐好转。第三类村是干部得到改造，能团结群众。有些村是老干部提拔，新干部继任，领导生产劲头大。生产工作进行得很顺利，突击下种成绩显著。
    二、依据政府保障农民财权的法令，反复解释说明：“剥削扣净劳动不动。”并强调提出：“要发大家发，懒人也得发，要动大家动，不动也得动。”又如粟城村赵银顺、杨满仓等思想闹通，为了消除发家致富的思想障碍，自动提出解疙瘩，成立调委会，解决问题安心生产。目前怕发财思想虽未彻底解决，但群众的发家致富思想也有了初步概念。
    三、抓紧时间鼓励群众突击下种。当领导上提出突击下种时，南冶原群众思想对抗，不愿下种。他们说：“小满夹忙种，一本顶两本。”领导上去针对着这个思想，提出了“小满夹忙种，迟了虽补种。”后来在连续的参战任务中不仅未松懈，相反的更加督促了下种，全村都行动起来了。”
    目前存在的问题是：一、不少村的个别户几年的互助账没清算，南冶村在报告他村耕牛数时少报了九头，追其原因，去年区所调剂与苇则耕了地，至今没给代价，因此再怕调剂，故少报。如粟城王全籽大前年给村干部何显荣作了七天活也没给过工资。二、果实普遍未清理，群众要求扫清，但时间又不允许。三、仍有大部村妇女没全部参加劳动，眼下全区又有百分之六十八的劳力参加战勤。据此情况特做以下决定：今后十天，继续突击下种，全区所有工人，学生妇女商号……一律参加下种，并保证尽先给参职人员及军属下种。
