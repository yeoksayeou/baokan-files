　　Cadres in Anyang District Lead the Masses in a Crash Planting, Brewing Revenge
　　[This newspaper, Anyang] District One is vigorously supporting the front lines, and at the same time, cadres are taking the lead in mobilizing the masses to carry water to plant cotton. Combining these two tasks, they are continuing to carry out the movement to oppose traitors, seek revenge, and investigate land. Yang Yougui, the director of the armed committee in Xiabao Village, carried water to plant seven mu of cotton, and Yang Fenchun, the village chief, carried water to plant several mu of cotton. Because of their leadership, the masses discussed that if the cadres are carrying water to plant, why shouldn't we do such a good thing? As a result, more than 200 people in the village followed the cadres and planted more than 500 mu of cotton by carrying water within seven days. At this time, the leadership immediately spread the example of cadres taking the lead and the amount of cotton planted to other villages. Cadres in Xiazhuang Village also learned from the leading role of cadres in Xiabao Village. The village chief and the chairman of the farmers' association each participated in a work team, mobilizing more than 150 people to carry water to plant 250 mu of cotton in five days. Immediately afterwards, nine villages in the entire district planted 2,229 mu of cotton. Currently, thirteen villages are planting tensely. In addition, in many villages, they are planting during the day and conducting anti-traitor liquidation at night. Cadres in Guoyuanhexi Village went to the fields with the masses to carry water to plant cotton during the day. While working, they used a casual chat to inspire complaints. At night, they discussed the crimes of the targets of struggle in the farmers' association. The masses in Quanmen Village continued to investigate land, and found that landlords had hidden 2,500 catties of cotton, 123 shi of grain, more than 500 pieces of clothing, 10 head of livestock, 2 mules, 30 sheep, 55 pockets, 31 quilts, 55 blankets, and 50 large vats. Currently, the masses in the village are carrying water to plant cotton during the day and investigating land and distributing the fruits at night. (County Committee)
　　[This newspaper] Song Village cadres in the second district of Neiqiu called for drought prevention and famine preparation, carrying water to plant cotton. They organized the masses to discuss methods. One person said to dig wells if there is no water in the wells, and another said to find a foreign bucket, thatched cans, and earthenware jars to put on ropes if there are not enough buckets. Finally, it was decided that from the 10th, women and children would be mobilized to organize and carry water to plant cotton, and it was planned to complete 300 mu in ten days. The more the masses talked at the meeting, the more energetic they became, and finally they proposed a competition to exceed the task. According to the statistics on the third afternoon (one and a half days), all of the 124 male full laborers, 64 half laborers, 24 female full laborers, 136 half laborers, and 5 auxiliary laborers in the village participated in the water carrying cotton planting campaign, digging more than a dozen wells, and planting 24 mu of cotton. In the cotton planting in Wuguo, 17 groups were organized, and it was proposed that each group should plant 15 mu of cotton, and the three-day plan was to complete 2.5 hectares. Cadres participated in each group to play a leading role. The children of Xiaoxiao School all participated in the cotton planting campaign in these three days, proposing to plant cotton for the families of soldiers first. The whole village had specific plans and specific division of labor. The young and middle-aged carried water, the elderly dug holes, and the children planted seeds. At the end of the three days, each group summarized and completed 314 mu, exceeding the plan by 64 mu. They also discussed and put forward the slogan: "We will plant even if it doesn't rain, and we will be able to plant if we water more in the pits!" The Kangnankan group proposed: "We will not only plant cotton. If it doesn't rain again, our group will carry water to plant 20 mu of sorghum." The masses get up at dawn every day when the bell rings and go to the fields, forming a vigorous cotton planting movement, and everyone is in high spirits. (Neiqiu Small Newspaper)
