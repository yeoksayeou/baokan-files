Ode to the New Nine Muses
    Guo Moruo

Last December 29th, the Literary Association had a year-end party. I had originally decided to attend, but I mistakenly remembered the date as the 30th. When I looked at the newspaper on the morning of the 30th, I realized the party had already taken place, which left me feeling utterly lost. I missed the opportunity to hear the valuable opinions of many friends regarding "Observations on Literary Work Before and After the Victory," which I found extremely regrettable.

I myself had also prepared to express some "Observations," and today I am writing them down here.

First, I must condemn myself. In the past year or so, my efforts in literary work have been truly poor, and I deeply feel ashamed. Some time ago, in the history and geography section of Wenhui Bao, I saw a Mr. "Japan" criticize me, saying that everyone must admit that Guo Moruo has not made much progress in recent years. I am truly grateful to him; he has truly pointed out my shortcomings. To be honest, I myself am the first to admit that I really haven't made much progress lately.

There is also a "liberal" professor who, I hear, shakes his head whenever my name is mentioned, because I "flew to Moscow" last year, which has become even more fodder for his head-shaking. I have seen many friends feeling indignant on my behalf about this, but it is really unnecessary. I want to say even more frankly that I myself often shake my head at myself, and certainly more vigorously than any professor. Not to mention having achieved nothing in the past year, what have I achieved in my entire life? It's truly pathetic! Fortunately, I still dare not sit in a well and view the sky, because I have also gone to swim in the sea. I know that the world outside the well is much wider, and within that vast world, countless large and small stars are truly dazzling. "Flying to Moscow" is similarly a regret for me, because my skills are too low. I didn't make good use of this opportunity to learn and improve a bit more, to write something that could be shown to others.

I don't intend to deliberately be self-effacing, using this "humility" virtue, which we Orientals particularly boast about, to cover up my own laziness and emptiness. A person who truly has genuine talent and knowledge disdains self-promotion, but also doesn't need to belittle himself. My efforts have been insufficient, I must admit, but I also don't want to be so magnanimous that I take responsibility for the sins of the era and the environment. What kind of era has this been "before and after the victory" for the past year or two? And what kind of environment are we in? Professor Fei Gong's whereabouts are still unknown, the blood of Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo has not yet dried, thirty million famine victims should not have starved to death completely, and the civil war spreading across nineteen provinces is killing thousands and tens of thousands of compatriots every day and every month. Anyone who is not an idiot can see it clearly!

I personally heard the beautiful four promises being read out. I personally participated in drafting some of the five resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. All of these have been blown away. I personally endured the stones of Cangbaitang and the iron bars of Jiaochangkou on my own head. I personally saw the destruction of the Democracy Daily and the New China Daily with my own eyes. I personally ate pork that cost five hundred yuan a pound in Chongqing and four thousand yuan a pound in Shanghai with my own mouth. I personally experienced the wind blowing across the world, the attack on people's representatives at the Xiaguan Railway Station on June 22nd, and the siege of vendors in Shanghai on December 1st. In Chongqing, I saw the authorities announce the abolition of nearly fifty laws restricting the rights of the people, and in Shanghai, I saw the authorities announce the prohibition of nearly fifty publications calling for democracy and peace. I saw *News* being forced to cease publication, *Weekly* being forced to cease publication, *Democracy* being forced to cease publication, *The Masses* and *Literary Anthology* not being allowed to be sold on the streets, and the yet-to-be-published *Literary Groups* being banned in the womb. What kind of era and environment is this, after all? I think saying this is probably not an overstatement, right? I think saying this – this is a political winter of minus thirty-five degrees, and a rocky field covered in ice and snow. I myself have not lived in a greenhouse, thank you very much, and I really don't sprout, can't take root, and am not in a hurry to talk about flowering and bearing fruit.

However, I am not saying this to excuse myself, but to remind myself of my awareness of the more resolute and unyielding friends. Even in this political winter of minus thirty-five degrees, in this snowy and icy world, most of my friends are still constantly producing. In the field of novels, there is Luo Binji, Lu Ling, Yu Ru... who can deny it? In the field of poetry, there is Ma Fantuo, Luyuan, Liyang... who can deny it? In the field of drama, there is Xia Yan, Chen Baichen, Wu Zuguang... who can deny it? In the field of criticism, there is Yang Hui, Shu Wu, Huang Lemian... who can deny it? These particularly strong and resilient friends of vigorous life, they are not only constantly producing, but also the finished products they produce are so strong and robust, able to withstand the chipping of ice, wind, and hail. This is where I find supreme comfort. The fact that we can still have an interest and spirit in survival in today's era and environment is given to us by these superhuman-like friends.

Please also forgive me, regarding the scope of so-called literature and art, I don't want to limit it to poetry, novels, drama, and criticism, although the current literary and artistic friends, especially the minority of greenhouse writers who write novels, draw the circle of literature and art very tightly. Except for their own novels, almost nothing else is considered "creation." They despise poetry, obliterate criticism, and dismiss drama as "not worth a glance." The world of literature and art should be even broader. Among the nine Greek Muses (Note 1), there are Clio, the goddess of history, and Urania, the goddess of astronomy. We must not forget them. Our Chinese tradition also has a similar spirit. Haven't we always regarded thinkers and historians like Zuo Qiuming, Zhuang Zhou, and Sima Qian as literary figures, just like Qu Yuan and Sima Xiangru? If we broaden the circle of literature and art in this way, then we have many more friends worthy of admiration. We cannot forget Du Shousu, Jian Bozan, and Hou Wailu in the field of ancient studies. We cannot forget Hua Gang, Hu Sheng, and Yu Huai in the field of modern studies (Note 2).

Countless brave and upright journalists, they are precisely today's Zuo Qiuming and Sima Qian. I feel that we should nominate them as the chief scholars in today's literary world. Literary forms evolve with the times. The literary world, which is now dominated by novels, is a product of capitalist society in Europe since the Ming and Qing dynasties in China. Although there is Calliope, the goddess of epic poetry, among the nine Muses, there is no novel goddess. The reporting literature of journalists should be the newest and most progressive form of literature and art. They grasp reality so firmly, reflect it so freshly, and criticize it so quickly! They have become our daily lives. Every morning and evening, just like people in the Middle Ages receiving divine revelation, we are being enlightened by journalists. What kind of literary work can match the power of news literature? What great writer can have as wide an audience as journalists? I want to praise the progressive journalist friends of the past year or so. They are truly today's Calliope, and their spiritual response is truly like lightning. They participate in any dangerous situation. Beating, bloodshed, imprisonment, life, what is it that they don't have a share in? Their literature is truly written in blood! The highest achievement in literature and art in the past year should belong to journalists. Such friends, please forgive me for not being able to write down all their names. There are truly stars all over the sky. (To be continued)

### 新缪司九神礼赞
郭沫若

专栏：

　　新缪司九神礼赞
    郭沫若
    去年十二月二十九日文协有一个辞年晚会，我本来决定要去参加的，但把日子记成三十日去了。三十日的清早一看报，才知会已经开过，使我膛然若失。关于“胜利前后到现在的文艺工作的观感”，好些朋友的宝贵意见，我失掉了听取的机会，实在是非常遗憾。
    我自己本来也准备着想发表一些“观感”的，今天我把他写在这儿。
    我首先要谴责我自己。在这一年多来，我在文艺工作上的努力实在太差，自己深深地感觉着惭愧。前些时候在文汇报的史地栏内，看见一位署名“日本”的先生批评到我，说谁也得承认郭沫若在近年来没有多大的进步。我真感谢他，他真是说到我的短处。认真说，我自己是比谁也先得承认，我近来实在是没有多么大的进步的。
    还有一位“自由主义”的教授，听说一提到我便摇头，因为我去年曾经“飞莫斯科”，更成为了他的摇头材料。我看到好些朋友为这事替我不平，其实是大可不必的。”我要更坦白的说一句，我对于自己也时常在摇头，而且一定比任何教授更摇得厉害。不说一年来毫无成就，就是我一辈子到底又成就了什么？真是可怜得很！幸好我还不敢坐井观天，因为我也到海里去游泳过一下。我知道井外的天地还宽广得多，而在那宽大的天地里面无数的大星小星实在光辉夺目。“飞莫斯科”在我倒也同样是一件遗憾，因为自己的本领太低。没有好好利用这个机会更学进步一点，写些可以见人的东西出来。
    我倒也并不想故意自谦，借这个我们东方人所特别夸耀的“谦虚”美德以掩盖自己的怠惰和空虚。确实地有真才实学的人，他是不屑于自我宣传，但也无须乎自我贬责的。我的努力不够，我得承认，但我也不想宽大到让时代和环境的罪过，也要由我来负责。“胜利前后到现在”的这一两年到底是什么时代呢？而我们所处的又是怎样的环境呢？费巩教授的下落至今都还不明，李公朴、闻一多的血还没有干，三千万的饥民应该还没有饿死完，蔓延了十九省的内战每天每月不知道要杀死几千几万的同胞，只要不是白痴，是谁也认得清楚！
    漂亮的四项诺言我自己的耳朵亲自听见宣读。政协的五项决议有一部分我自己的手亲自参加过草拟。这些都吹掉了。沧白堂的石子，较场口的铁棒，我自己的头亲自捱过。民主报的捣毁，新华日报的捣毁，我自己的眼睛亲自看见过。由重庆的五百块钱一斤、到上海的四千块钱一斤的猪肉，我自己的嘴亲自吃过。打风遍天下，六月二十二日下关车站打人民代表，十二月一日上海围剿摊贩，不佞也躬逢其盛。在重庆，我看见当局宣布废除了将近五十种的束缚人民权利的法令，到上海我又看见当局宣布了禁止将近五十种的呼吁民主和平的刊物，我看见《消息》被迫停刊，《周报》被迫停刊，《民主》被迫停刊，《群众》《文萃》不准在街头贩卖，还未出版的《文群》在胎中遭了禁止。这到底是什么时代，怎样的环境呢？我想这样说，大概总不会过份吧？我想这样说——这是零下三十五度的政治冬季，而且是冰雪满地的岩田。我自己没有住在温室里面，敬谢不敏，实在并不出芽，扎不起根，还不忙说开花结实。
    然而我这样说倒也并不是想替我自己解嘲，而是想提醒我自己对于更坚毅倔强的朋友们的认识。就这样零下三十五度的政治冬季的雪地冰天，而多数的朋友们仍然在不断地生产。小说方面的骆宾基，路翎，郁如…………谁个能够否认？诗歌方面的马凡陀，绿原，力扬，……谁个能够否认？戏剧方面的夏衍，陈白尘，吴祖光……，谁个能够否认？批评方面的杨晦，舒无，黄乐眠……，谁个能够否认？这些有生力量特别强韧的朋友们，他们不仅不断地在生产，而且所生产出来的成品那样坚强茁壮，经得起冰风雹雨的铲削。这是使我得到无上安慰的地方，我们在今天这样的时代和环境中还能有生存的兴趣和精神，就是这些类似超人的朋友们所给予我们的。
    还要请容恕我，关于所谓文艺的范围，我不想把它限制在诗歌、小说、戏剧、批评里面，虽然现今的文艺朋友们，尤其是搞小说的少数温室作家，他们把文艺的圈子画得很紧，除掉自己的小说之外差不多就无所谓“创作”，他们藐视诗歌，抹杀批评，斥戏剧为“不值一顾”。文艺的天地更要广泛。希腊的缪司九神（注一）里面，本有司历史的克略女神（Clio）和司星宿的优罗尼女神（ＵＲＡＮＩＡ）我们可不要忘记。我们中国的传统也有和这类似的精神，我们向来不是把左邱明、庄周、司马迁那样的思想家和历史家，也和屈原司马相如一样，作为文学家在看待的吗？假使我们这样把文艺的圈子放宽，那我们还有的是朋友值得赞叹。在古代研究方面的杜守素、翦伯赞、侯外卢，我们不能忘记。在现代研究方面的华岗、胡绳、于怀，我们不能忘记。（注二）
    无数勇敢正直的新闻记者，他们正是今天的左邱明、司马迁，我倒感觉着我们今天的文坛上应该推他们为祭酒。文艺形式是随着时代进化的，今天以小说称雄的文坛，在中国明清之际以来，在欧洲是资本主义社会的产物。缪司九神里面虽然有司叙事诗的女神珈略普（ＣＡＬＬＩＯＰＥ），并无小说娘娘的存在。新闻记者的报导文学应该是最新最进步的一种文艺形式。把现实抓的那么牢，反映得那么新鲜，批判的那么迅速！它们成为了我们每天的丢命。我们每天清早和晚上，就像中世纪的人要受到神的启示一样，我们是受着新闻记者的启示的。有那一种文艺作品能够抵得新闻文学的力量呢？有那一位大作家能有新闻记者的读者那样广泛？我要赞仰一年多来的进步的记者朋友们。他们真是今天的珈略普，他们的精神反应真有如电光石火。任何危险的场合都有他们的参预。捱打，流血，坐牢，生命，那一样没有他们的份？他们的文学倒真真正正是用血写出来的！一年多来的文艺上最高成就应该属于记者。这样的朋友们，恕我把名字写不完，写不完，那真是满天星斗。（未完）
    （注一）缪斯（Muse）是希腊神话传说中的九个司文艺的女神，其名除文中所列举者外，尚有Polyhymnia＝抒情事，颂神赋，Erato＝情爱诗，VIelpomene＝悲剧，Thalia＝喜剧，Euterpe＝音乐，Terpsichore＝跳舞。
