　　A Discussion on the Issue of "Stabilizing Wages"
    Bomín
    After reading the article "Research on Solving Labor Shortages and Stabilizing Wages" by Comrade Shang Feng and others published on May 10th, I felt there were some issues I would like to raise for discussion with everyone:

    The widespread increase in agricultural wages is indeed something that deserves our attention. The main reason for this phenomenon is the labor shortage caused by the self-defense war. According to surveys in several villages in Wuxiang, Heshun, Licheng, Xingtai, and Wu'an counties in Taihang, the land that cannot be cultivated due to insufficient male labor accounts for 30% to 39% of the total land area. Not only is there a labor shortage in agricultural production, but also in the industrial and handicraft sectors. Secondly, due to the labor shortage and limitations in technical conditions, the output of industrial and some sideline products is low and cannot meet demand, resulting in high profits and high wages. For example, the daily wage and additional compensation for workers in Wuxiang can reach 1,000 yuan. The daily wage for workers in general rural workshops is also around two dou of rice. Therefore, although agricultural wages have increased compared to the past, they are still lower than those in industry and sideline occupations, and in some areas, the disparity is even greater. It is no wonder that rural labor is flocking to the industrial and sideline sectors. Another reason is that after the land reform's leveling and replenishment, farmers have obtained land, and there is very little surplus labor besides that needed for self-cultivation. Therefore, even if wages are raised, it is difficult to find a long-term laborer (for example, in the second district of Wuxiang, the annual wage for a long-term laborer is as high as 21 shi and 3.5 dou—including all kinds of compensation converted, and still no one is willing to do it). I believe that the above are the three reasons for the high agricultural wages. I do not agree with Comrade Shang Feng and others that the existence of the small-peasant mentality among farmers is the primary reason for the wage increase, because ideological problems are not the most important factor determining the cost of labor. Therefore, even if the ideological problem is solved, it will not have much effect on the rise and fall of wages.

    The general high cost of labor due to labor shortages is a current social phenomenon, and in our region, there are no exceptions in any place or any production sector. Therefore, we cannot simply focus on the high or low agricultural wages, nor can we simply seek ways to raise or lower them from the perspective of agricultural wages. Therefore, the proposal to stabilize wages put forward by Comrade Shang Feng and others is worth considering. We can imagine that if we start from subjective wishes and forcibly lower agricultural wages (although Comrade Shang Feng has not explicitly stated to what extent wages should be lowered), the result may be counterproductive, that is, forcing the few remaining rural laborers to invest even less in agricultural production. Because with high wages in other sectors, no one is willing to exchange the same amount of labor for the lowest compensation. This will further exacerbate the urgency of agricultural labor. If the stabilization of wages in agricultural mutual aid carries some kind of coercion, it will inevitably affect the sustainability and consolidation of production mutual aid.

    I do not deny the difficulties caused by the increase in agricultural wages, especially the greater difficulties for military families, veterans' families, and orphans. The crux of this problem is that the value of agricultural products that can be cultivated by one laborer is not commensurate with the cost of investment in land (including wage payments). Some households lacking labor have little left after paying wages. This is the contradiction caused by the increase in wages (which is much worse than the production profits of industry and sideline occupations). The solution to this difficulty, at present, may be to save labor and promote labor intensity (I agree with the last two points made by Comrade Shang Feng in the article and will not repeat them), thereby substantially overcoming the drastic wage fluctuations that occur during the busy farming season due to the extreme shortage of labor. In addition, we can also use the past experience of some villages in expanding the scope of labor exchange: that is, widely organize auxiliary labor from men, women, old, and weak, and implement large-scale labor exchange between various sideline productions and agricultural labor. For example, weaving, making clothes, shoes, and socks, collecting firewood and manure, etc., are exchanged for agricultural labor under the principle of equivalent value, thereby substantially compensating for the excessive or insufficient payment of wages for agricultural products. This is not only through mutual aid to combine agricultural and sideline occupations in terms of management and capital, but also to combine them more broadly in terms of labor exchange.

### 对“平抑工资”问题的商榷

　　对“平抑工资”问题的商榷
    渤民
    读了五月十日报载尚枫等同志之《解决劳力困难，平抑工资的研究》一文后，感到有些问题，愿意提出来和大家商讨：
    目前农业工资的普遍增高，确实值得我们注意。造成这种现象的主要原因，是由于自卫战争而引起的劳力缺乏。如太行之武乡、和顺、黎城、邢台及武安等县几个村的调查，因男劳力不足而种不过来的土地，占土地总数百分之三十至百分之三十九。不仅农业生产中劳力如此，而工业手工业部门中也有这种现象。其次，正由于劳力的缺乏，再加以技术条件的限制，致使工业与某些副业的成品产量不大，供不应需，因而利润大，工资高。如武乡职工每日工资与附加报酬竟达千元。一般农村作坊工人每日工资也都在二斗米左右。因此，目前农业工资虽然较前提高，但较诸工业副业中的工资仍然是低的，甚至某些地区悬殊甚大。这就无怪乎农村劳力都趋向于工业和副业方面了。另外一个原因，即经过了土地改革中的填平补齐后，农民都取得了土地，除供自耕外，剩余劳力很少，所以即使工资提高，觅一长工也很困难（如武乡二区，一个长工全年工资达二十一石三斗五——连各种报酬折算在内，而且还没人愿干）。我认为以上便是造成农业工资高涨的三个原因。我不同意尚枫等同志把农民圪瘩户思想的存在，举为工资上涨的第一原因，因为思想问题不是决定劳力代价的重要因素，所以即使解决了思想问题，对工资的涨落也不会起多大作用。
    由于劳力缺乏而促成一般劳力代价高，这是当前整个的社会现象，在本区说来，任何地方，与任何生产部门均无例外。所以我们不能单纯从农业工资上来计较高低，同样也不能单纯从农业工资上来钻求升降的办法。因此，尚枫等同志提出平抑工资的主张是值得考虑的。我们可以想到，假如我们从主观愿望出发，硬将农业工资压低（虽然，尚枫同志还未明确提出工资要压低到什么程度），其结果可能适得其反，那便是迫使农村仅有的某些剩余劳力会更少的投入农业生产中去。因在其它方面工资高涨的情况下，谁也不愿意以同样的劳力换取最低的代价。这样，会更加促进农业劳力的紧迫程度。假如在农业互助中平抑工资带有某种强制性，则又必然会影响生产互助的持久与巩固。
    我并不否认由于农业工资的上涨所引起的一些困难，特别是军、烈属与孤寡户困难更多，这个问题的症结，是一个劳力所能耕作的农产量的所值与用于土地投资的代价（包括工资支付）不相适应，有些劳力缺乏户，打下粮食除了工资，便所余无几了，这就是因工资上涨所引起的矛盾所在（这比起工业与副业的生产利润来是差的很多）。这个困难的解决，在目前说来，可能做到的就是如何节约劳力与发扬劳动强度（我同意尚枫等同志文中最后提出的两点意见并不赘述），用此以相当克服在农忙中因劳力奇缺而发生的工资急剧波动。此外，还可运用以往某些村子扩大劳力交换范围的经验：即广泛的组织男女老弱之辅助劳力，从各种副业生产中与农业劳力实行大变工。如用纺织，做被服鞋袜，打柴积肥等，在等价原则下，与农业劳力相交换，用此以相当的弥补农产品过多的或不敷工资之支付，这就是不仅通过互助把农副业在经营上与资金上相结合，并更广泛的从劳力交换上结合起来。
