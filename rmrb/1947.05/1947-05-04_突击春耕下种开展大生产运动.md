　　Currently, it is the spring plowing season. Land reform in our area has been basically completed, but there are still some loose ends. The vast majority of farmers have been allocated land. The common new demands of the emancipated farmers are: to organize, develop production, build a family business, and become rich. At the same time, in order to ensure the food supply for the long-term war, it is also necessary to step up spring plowing and increase grain production. Therefore, all localities should launch a great production movement based on land reform, focusing on agriculture combined with sideline occupations and handicrafts, to develop national wealth. Otherwise, it will be impossible to guarantee military and civilian food needs, which will affect the support for the long-term patriotic self-defense war. The central issue now is: to be good at solving some problems of combining production with war service and production with land reform, seize the time, complete the spring plowing work, and strive to not leave an acre of land uncultivated. This is the basic link to doing a good job in the whole year's production. Time is very tight, and it cannot be delayed any longer. We must carry out the great production movement with the same strength as we carried out land reform.

　　The general goal of launching the great production movement is mainly to restore the production level before the War of Resistance, increase the production of grain and daily necessities, achieve self-sufficiency and "耕三余一" [cultivate three and have one remaining], and ensure the military and civilian food needs of the self-defense war. To achieve this goal: it is necessary to focus on agriculture, universally respond to Chairman Mao's call, "organize," carry out labor mutual aid and exchanging of labor, and organize all labor and animal power to participate in production. At this time of labor shortage, we must also be good at organizing women, children, and the elderly to participate in production to supplement the labor shortage and achieve the goal of not reducing production and increasing production. Veterans' family members, families of martyrs, and demobilized soldiers should all join production organizations as long as they have labor power and do their best to increase production and overcome dependence. To achieve this goal: it is also necessary to promote deep plowing and careful cultivation, improve agricultural technology, build water conservancy projects, and select improved varieties, such as Golden Queen and 169 wheat. To achieve this goal: on the basis of being organized, it is also necessary to organize surplus labor, develop sideline production, implement the direction of combining agriculture and sideline occupations throughout the year, and universally carry out textile production, salt extraction, saltpeter production, oil pressing, indigo planting, paper making, iron smelting, and the establishment of small farm tool factories, etc., and vigorously develop the transportation industry. In short, in addition to ensuring great victories in military affairs, we must also ensure a great victory in the production movement. Whether it is a cooperative or a transportation team, it must be combined with mass production, give unlimited play to the mass viewpoint, organize agriculture, industry, and sideline occupations to serve the production of social wealth, supply raw materials, transport and sell products, and exchange materials. Oppose the purely profit-seeking viewpoint or methods of engaging in commercial speculation. Experience has proven that all cooperatives and transportation teams that are formed by the masses themselves and serve the masses' own production, can meet the needs of the masses, benefit the masses, and help them build their families and businesses and become rich, will thrive and develop day by day; on the contrary, those who pursue short-term profits, hoard goods, or engage in commercial speculation, will all lose money and ultimately harm the masses and themselves.

　　In launching a crash spring planting campaign and a great production movement, it is also necessary to combine it with the work of land reform. When the production season arrives in the whole area, we should all enter the great production movement, but this does not mean that the landlord class has been completely eliminated, the land reform work has been completely completed, and we can sit back and relax and enter a slack phase. This is wrong. In areas that have indeed undergone leveling and replenishment (most areas of Taihang, Taiyue, and Southern Hebei), the landlord class has indeed surrendered to the peasants, but it has not reached the point of eradication. The elimination of the landlord class is not thorough enough, and they still hide land and property, conceal "changing sky" accounts, and prepare for one morning when the weather suddenly turns dark and they can implement a restoration. The fruits of land reform are not distributed fairly and reasonably enough. Therefore, even in the great production movement in the above-mentioned areas, it is still necessary to conduct partial, small, but regular investigations of land, classes, and ideology, in order to distinguish class boundaries and finally and completely eliminate the landlord class from history, so that the landlord class will never have the opportunity to restore itself, not only from the economic and political aspects, but also to eliminate the influence of the landlord class from the backward peasant class and the minds of certain staff members. As for the fact that cadres and activists occupy more of the fruits of land reform, it still requires long-term adjustment to achieve voluntary withdrawal, but it must be withdrawn to achieve fair and reasonable distribution. This is still an arduous task and should be strived to be completed gradually in the production process.

　　The development of land reform in our area is uneven. If certain individual counties, districts, and villages have not yet carried out the leveling and replenishment movement, then land reform should continue, but it should be done in a way that does not violate the farming season or leave land uncultivated; in the border areas and guerrilla areas where land reform has not been completely completed, land reform should still be the central task, with one hand holding a gun and the other distributing land, and carrying out the struggle to protect the land, distribute the land, and oppose the "倒算" [reversal of verdicts]. However, labor and military should also be combined to launch a crash spring planting campaign.

　　In order to ensure the good development of the spring plowing and great production movement, we must quickly overcome all obstacles and difficulties that hinder the development of production. We must eliminate the concerns of some farmers, especially middle peasants, who are afraid of struggle, afraid of being "cut like leeks" [repeatedly exploited], and afraid of heavy burdens, and are unwilling to produce, and the ideas of some idlers who rely on struggle for a living; as long as the liquidation of the landlords and old rich peasants who have been liquidated has been completed thoroughly, they will also be encouraged to participate in production; all levels of the masses should be informed that the party's policy is to oppose feudal exploitation and oppression, and to help peasants organize, develop production, build families and businesses, and become rich. The policy towards new capitalism is to adopt a policy of development and encouragement, not to struggle against anyone who is rich; in areas where land distribution has undergone leveling and replenishment and has achieved fairness and reasonableness in terms of quality and quantity, no more liquidation will be carried out, and the government may issue decrees to protect land ownership and property rights by county, consolidating the new property relations; in areas where land has not been well distributed, it should be distributed quickly to determine land ownership so that peasants can produce with peace of mind. Even in areas where distribution cannot be completed before spring plowing, we must still rush to plant the crops to prevent the land from being left uncultivated.

　　In order to launch the great production movement and take care of the masses' labor difficulties, we must consider long-term plans, promote the experience of saving people's labor, and oppose any phenomenon of wasting people's labor. In particular, we must reduce the people's corvée burden and determine that except for the militia participating in the war and necessary war service, all corvée will be stopped. For the work of participating in the war and war service, accurate calculations should be made, so that each battle does not exceed one soldier per farmer, and a regional war service adjustment method is implemented, with village, district, county, and special district major adjustments, core area and war area major adjustments, core area assisting border area, non-war area assisting war area, and a unified accounting and conversion of labor for war service and production.

　　Agricultural loans should be quickly and timely loaned to the peasants. After the loan is made, an inspection should be organized to see if the loan is reasonable, and inspections should be carried out along with the loan to promote production.

　　To cooperate with the production movement, we must practice thrift and prepare for famine, implement the Central Bureau's instructions on thrift among the masses, and oppose waste.

　　The leadership must devote 90% of its energy to timely inspection and assistance to mass production. All rear institutions, schools, and organizations, without exception, should implement the system of leaders taking responsibility and everyone taking action. In addition to carrying out institutional production, they should organize production teams and wealth-generating teams to help the masses rush to spring plowing. A competition to perform meritorious service for the people on the production front should be launched among all cadres, and a system of recording, commending, and rewarding meritorious service should be implemented to cultivate labor heroes and production models and perform new meritorious service for the people.

### 突击春耕下种开展大生产运动

　　突击春耕下种开展大生产运动
    目前正值春耕时期，我区土地改革已基本上完成，但尚留有尾巴，广大农民都已分得土地，翻身农民普遍的新的要求是：组织起来，发展生产，兴家立业，发财致富。同时，为了保证长期战争的粮食供给，亦必须加紧春耕，增产粮食。因此，各地应在土地改革的基础上开展一个大生产运动，以农业为主并结合副业和手工业进行，以发展国民财富。否则，将无法保证军需民食，影响支持长期的爱国自卫战争。现在的中心问题是：要善于解决生产与战争勤务，生产与土地改革相结合的一些问题，抓紧时间，完成春耕工作，求得不荒一亩地，这是做好全年生产的基本环节，时间已十分紧迫，不可再缓，要以进行土地改革的同样力量来进行大生产运动。
    开展大生产运动的总目标，主要是恢复抗战前的生产水平，增产粮食和日用必须品，达到自给自足与耕三余一，保证自卫战争的军需民食。为达到此目的：必须以农业为主，普遍响应毛主席的号召，“组织起来”，进行劳动互助，变工拨工，把一切劳畜力都组织起来参加生产，在此劳动力缺乏的时候，还要善于组织妇女儿童老年人参加生产，以补劳动力之不足，做到不降低生产，增加生产的目的，荣誉军人干部家属、烈属及退伍军人，只要有劳动力的，均应加入生产组织，尽力之所能及以增加生产，克服依赖现象。为达此目的：还必须提倡深耕细作，改良农作技术，兴修水利，选种优良品种，如金皇后，一六九小麦等。为达此目的：在组织起来的基础上，还必须组织剩余劳动力，发展副业生产，实行农副业结合，贯彻全年的方向，普遍开展纺织、淋盐、熬硝、榨油、种蓝、造纸、炼铁及开办小型农具工厂等，并大力发展运输事业。总之，我们除开保证在军事上打大胜仗之外，还须保证在生产运动上也要打个大胜仗。不论合作社运输队，均须与群众生产相结合，无限发挥群众观点，组织农工副业为生产社会财富，供应原料，运销产品，交流物资而服务。反对单纯营利观点或从事商业投机的办法。经验证明：所有合作社运输队，凡是为群众自己所组成又为群众自己生产而服务并能适应群众需要，给群众生利，帮助其兴家立业，发财致富者，均能欣欣向荣，日益发展；反之，凡是追逐近利，囤积居奇，或作商业投机的，没有一个不亏本、最后害了群众又害了自己的。
    在突击春耕下种，开展大生产运动时，又必须与土地改革的工作相结合。在全区生产季节到来时，均应进入大生产运动，但这并不是说地主阶级已经彻底消灭，土地改革工作已经完全结束，我们已可高枕无忧，来一个拉的阶段，这是错误的。凡确实经过填平补齐的地区（太行太岳及冀南的大部地区），地主阶级确已向农民屈服低头，但并未达到根绝程度，地主阶级消灭的不彻底，仍有隐瞒土地财产，藏变天账，准备有一个早上，天气突然变暗，实行复辟。土地改革果实分配尚不公平合理。因此，即使在上述地区大生产运动中，仍需部分的点滴的，但是经常的进行查土地、查阶级、查思想的工作，以便分清阶级界线，最后的，彻底的，从历史上消灭地主这个阶级，使地主阶级永无复辟之余地，不仅从经济上政治上消灭地主阶级，而且要从落后的农民阶层，及某些工作人员的头脑中消灭地主阶级的影响。至于干部积极分子多占土地改革果实，尚需长期的调整，做到自愿退出，但又必须退出，以达到分配的公平合理，还是一个艰巨的工作，应争取在生产过程中，逐步的完成这一任务。
    我区土地改革发展不平衡，如某些个别县区村，尚未进行过填平补齐运动，则应继续土地改革，但应做到不违农时，不荒地；边沿区游击区土地改革尚未彻底完成者，仍应以土地改为中心工作，一手拿枪、一手分田，开展保田分田反倒算斗争，但亦应实行劳武结合，突击春耕的工作。
    为保证很好的开展春耕大生产运动，必须迅速克服发展生产的一切阻碍和困难问题，要消除部分农民特别中农的怕斗争、怕割韭菜、怕负担重，而不愿生产的顾虑，和有些人靠斗争吃饭的二流子思想；对被清算的地主和旧富农只要清算已经完毕彻底，亦奖励其参加生产；对各阶层群众都要说明党的政策是反对封建主义的剥削和压迫，是帮助农民组织起来，发展生产，兴家立业，发财致富，对新资本主义，则是采取发展和奖励政策，不是谁富就斗谁；对土地分配已经经过填平补齐，按照质量和数量，达到公平合理的地区，即不再清算，政府即可以县为单位分别的公布保障地权财权的法令，巩固新的财产关系；对土地尚未分配好的地区，应迅速分配，确定地权，使农民安心生产，即使春耕前不能分配完毕的地区，亦必须突击下种，不使土地荒芜。
    为要开展大生产运动，照顾群众劳力困难，从长期打算，发扬节约民力的经验，反对任何浪费民力的现象，特别要减轻人民的支差负担，确定除民兵参战和必要的战勤外，停止一切支差。对参战战勤工作，实行精确计算，作到每战役不超过一兵一夫，实行全区战勤调剂办法，村、区、县、专区大调济，腹心区与战争区大调济，腹心区协助边沿区，非战区协助战区，并实行战勤与生产大变工，参战支差生产统一计工、折工的办法。
    对农业贷款，应迅速及时的贷到农民手中，贷出后应组织检查，是否贷的合理，要随贷出随检查，借以推进生产。
    配合生产运动，要厉行节约备荒，将中央局的节约指示贯彻在群众中去，反对浪费现象。
    领导上必须拿出百分之九十的力量来及时的进行检查和帮助群众生产，一切后方机关、学校、团体，无例外的均应实行首长负责，大家动手，除进行机关生产外，要组织生产队发家队帮助群众突击春耕，在所有干部中展开在生产战线上为人民立功的竞赛运动，实行记功表功和奖励政策，培养劳动英雄和生产模范，为人民再建功勋。
