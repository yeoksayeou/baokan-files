A Liberation Fighter's Accusation

Chen Jianhong, formerly a corporal squad leader in the Special Service Company of the 90th Division of the Hu Army, is now twenty-two years old. He was liberated in November of last year in the Battle of Pu County in Jinxi. He received training for two months in the "Liberation Brigade" in Lishi, and voluntarily joined a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army in late February. In the Qinghuabian battle on March 25th, he fought bravely, charging ahead, capturing twelve prisoners and seizing four rifles, greatly exceeding his original plan of capturing two enemies and seizing two guns. He was credited twice on the "Defend Chairman Mao" merit book. The following is his statement at the merit citation meeting:

"I am from Hanzhong, southern Shaanxi. When I left home in 1931, my parents were still alive. In those days, we rented thirty mu of land from the landlord Fang Huaiqing, paying two shi per mu as rent, which was more than half of the harvest. In the thirtieth year, there was a drought and we couldn't pay the rent, but the Fang family only knew how to urge and scold us with abusive words and slaps. My father was so angry that he sued to the county government, but the Fang family bribed the county magistrate, and instead demanded that my family pay all eight shi of arrears and apologize with a feast. My father sold our only cow to pay the rent, and we gave up the land. This is how the Fang family and my family became enemies.

"In March 1931, when conscription came, Fang Huaiqing used his personal connections through the Bao head to capture me. I was only seventeen years old at that time. At first, I went to the local National Militia, and after a month I was transferred to the 'Children's Platoon' of the Special Service Company of the 90th Division of the Hu Army. Platoon leader Liu Zhongju was very barbaric. Once during morning exercises, I didn't do well, and the platoon leader punched me in the chest, which hurt for a whole month. Another time, when I was a purchasing agent in the gas defense platoon, the cook burned the steamer a little, and the platoon leader beat me with a carrying pole. ...Such unreasonable things were common in the Kuomintang army!

"Another time, I had already become a corporal squad leader, it was during the New Year, and platoon leader Zhu Shenghai ordered me to find cypress firewood from the homes of the common people. I didn't find any, and when I came back I was beaten with bamboo sticks. He also insulted me in front of everyone and slapped me in the face. I thought about running away, but I couldn't. Alas! Where could I go? Thinking of the pig shit air I suffered in the Kuomintang army, and remembering my family's oppression by the landlord, I shed tears.

"Now I am a soldier in the People's Army of the Eighth Route Army, there is democracy and freedom, and my spirit is so happy! But when I first joined the Liberation Brigade for training, my mind had not completely changed, and I still wanted to retire and go home. Later, I thought about it again and again, if I didn't defeat Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan's dogs, there would still be no way out for me at home. I decided to request to join the Northwest People's Liberation Army. When I got to the company, the superiors of the company treated me especially well and cared about me very much. The instructor carried my gun for me when I couldn't walk during marches, and he patiently explained the principle of serving the people to me many times, opening my mind. Compared with the dark days of the past, who wouldn't be moved?

"Comrades, you ask me why I am so brave in fighting as soon as I come over? My bravery comes from here. I hate the traitorous army of the Kuomintang, I hate the landlords and big capitalists who oppress the poor. I am grateful to the Eighth Route Army for liberating me. In order to defend Chairman Mao, I am willing to sacrifice my life. In the future, I will make more contributions and kill more enemies. I think that many of the friends who are still working in the Chiang army are suffering the same fate as me. I hope they will wake up soon, lay down their weapons, escape from the sea of ​​misery, and stand in the ranks of the people!"

    一个解放战士的控诉
    陈建鸿原是胡军九十师师部特务连下士班长，现年二十二岁，去年十一月在晋西蒲县战斗中才得解放，曾在离石“解放大队”受训两个月，二月下旬自愿参加人民解放军某部。三月二十五日青化砭战斗中，他作战勇敢，冲锋在前，捉了十二个俘虏，缴步枪四支，大大超过了他原来捉敌二名缴枪两支的计划。“保卫毛主席”的功劳簿上他被记了两次功。下面是他在记功会上的自述：
    “我是陕南汉中人，三一年离家时，父母还在，当年租种大地主方槐青三十亩地，每亩出租二石，占收成的一半还多。三十年天旱交不起租子，家里没吃的，但方家只管催逼，恶言斥骂、打耳光。父亲气愤不过，就告到县府，但方家贿赂县长，反而要我家将八石欠租全部交清，还要请客赔礼。父亲把唯一的牛卖了才交了租，地也退了，就这样方家和我家结下仇恨。
    “三十一年三月间征兵，方槐青经过保长的私人关系，就把我捉走了。那时我才十七岁。最初是到地方国民兵团，一个月后就转入胡军九十师师部特务连‘小孩排’。排长刘忠桔很野蛮，一次早操，我操的不好，排长就当胸给我一拳，整整痛了一个月。又一次我在防毒排当采买，伙夫把蒸笼烧坏了一点，排长打了我一顿扁担。……在国民党队伍里这种无理的事情可多呢！
    “又一次我已当了下士班长，正是过年的时候，排长朱盛海要我到老百姓家里去找柏树柴。我没有找到，回来即是一顿竹棒子。还当着大家辱骂我，打我的耳光。我想着跑，跑不掉。唉！那里去呢？提起我在国民党队伍里受的这些猪屎气，想起我的家庭受地主的压迫，我就流泪。
    “现在我在八路军人民队伍里当战士，有民主有自由，精神可痛快啦！不过我刚入解放大队受训的时候，脑筋也没有彻底改变，还想退伍回家。后来我想了又想，不把蒋介石胡宗南狗日的打退，回家还是没有出路。我决定请求参加西北人民解放军。到了连队，连队的上级对我都特别好，很关心我，行军中走不动路指导员替我背枪，一连好几次还耐心的给我讲解为人民服务的道理，给我开脑筋。和过去的黑暗日子对照起来，谁不感动呢？
    “同志，你问我为什么一过来打仗就这么勇敢吗？勇敢就由这里来的。我恨国民党卖国军队，我恨大地主、大资产阶级压迫穷人。我感激八路军解放了我。为了保卫毛主席，就是牺牲了性命我也甘心情愿。今后我还要多多的立功杀敌。我想现在还在蒋军队伍里干事的朋友们，不少的弟兄遭受着和我同样的命运。希望他们早点觉悟，放下武器，脱离苦海，站到人民的队伍里来。”（新华社陕北前线记者海棱）
