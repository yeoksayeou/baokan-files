Buying Sesame Cakes, Spoon-Feeding Egg Drop Soup, Lighting the Way: Taking Care of Every Need
　　Women of Lianhe Village, Cixian County, Care for the Wounded
[Our Newspaper's Report] The women of Lianhe Village, Fifth District of Cixian County, enthusiastically care for the wounded. On the evening of the 12th of this month, thirty wounded soldiers were transferred from the front. Women cadres Li Aizhen, Li Guiqin, Zhang Xiuwen and other comrades excitedly led a dozen women to care for them. They used small spoons to feed soup and water, spoonful by spoonful, and voluntarily spent money to buy a hundred or so cooked eggs for the wounded soldiers to eat. Huang Shoujing, the head of the sisters' group, used her saved-up private money to buy sesame cakes, added an egg to each, and fed them to the wounded soldiers. After they finished the sesame cakes, she spoon-fed them egg drop soup, spoonful by spoonful, taking care of the wounded soldiers perfectly. She also voluntarily took lanterns and stretchers to lead the way to Zhifang Village. The stretcher bearers were moved and said, "This little girl is truly rare. The enthusiasm of the women in this village for caring for the wounded is the first time we've seen it."
