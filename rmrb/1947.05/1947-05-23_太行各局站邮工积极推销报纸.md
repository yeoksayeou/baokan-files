Taihang Region Post Office Workers Actively Promote Newspapers
[This newspaper's Taihang News] Post office workers in various bureaus and stations in Taihang actively promote newspapers. Every month when the newspaper subscription period arrives (from the 15th to the 25th), they automatically look for subscribers and develop new subscribers. Comrade Wei Baoshu, a post office worker at the Yangyi Bureau, proactively went door-to-door to various government offices, factories, shops, and people's homes to solicit newspaper subscriptions, subscribing to more than 150 copies in May. Li Guiliang from the Changzhi City Bureau promoted newspaper subscriptions along the street. In the past, not many newspapers were subscribed to in the tenth district of Wu'an. Comrade Guo Conghui, a post office worker, used village cadre meetings to promote the benefits of newspapers, and told some comrades who were illiterate and could not read newspapers: "You are village cadres, you should know good news early. Even if you are illiterate, you should subscribe to the newspaper and find a literate person to read it so that everyone can listen." Twelve copies of the People's Daily were newly subscribed at once. Comrade Wang Husheng, a post office worker at the Cixian Bureau, went to Pengcheng to promote newspaper subscriptions. In April, there were 80 copies of the People's Daily, and in May there were 130 copies. As soon as the newspapers are delivered to the post office, the post office comrades always try to avoid having the newspapers stay in the bureau. When the newspapers arrive at the Zuoquan Post Office at 5 pm, Comrade Zhang Jinfu, a post office worker, always delivers them before eating. In order to let the front lines read the newspapers early, Comrade Dong Chouhai, a post office worker from the Shexian Bureau, proposed carrying more weight. He carried more than 80 kilograms in one load. (Yao Cheng)
