　　Our Army Liberates Pinglu
    Artillery Fire Can Cut Off the Longhai Transportation
    [Xinhua News Agency, South Shanxi, Urgent Telegram, 5th] The South Shanxi People's Liberation Army liberated Pinglu City on the 4th. The enemy, attempting to break through and escape, is being encircled and annihilated by us in the suburbs. Pinglu is only five li away from Shanxian on the Longhai Railway across the river, and the People's Liberation Army's strong artillery fire can cut off Longhai transportation at any time.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 5th] The People's Liberation Army in South Shanxi has strict discipline. During the battle to liberate Quwo, the soldiers did not take a single blade of grass or tree from the masses, and completely turned over to the public 14,250 jin of cotton, 500 shi of grain, and 100,000 jin of salt seized from the enemy. Before the government stipulated the currency exchange rate, they stopped purchasing goods and compensated for the losses of the masses. The city's residents praised them as "unparalleled in the world." The reason for this strict discipline is, first, in-depth mobilization. The company introduced examples of good discipline in advance, so that everyone fully understands that strict battlefield discipline and mass discipline are important guarantees for victory in battle. Secondly, leading comrades attach importance to this work. The political director of the department personally participated in the picket team and entered the city with the vanguard troops to check and supervise. Thirdly, cadres and soldiers with excellent discipline were selected to participate in the picket team and the work team. The picket team was responsible for martial law, maintaining order, investigating losses, and checking household registration. The work team was responsible for condolences, compensation, and the organized collection of Jiang's puppet property.

　　我军解放平陆
    炮火可断陇海交通
    【新华社晋南五日急电】晋南人民解放军四日解放平陆城，企图突围逃窜之敌正在城郊为我聚歼中。平陆与陇海路上的陕县隔河相距仅五华里，人民解放军强烈炮火随时可切断陇海交通。
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫五日电】晋南人民解放军纪律严明。在解放曲沃战斗中，战士们未取群众一草一木，并将缴自敌人之一万四千二百五十斤棉花，五百石粮食，十万斤食盐完全缴公。在政府未规定货币比值前停购货物，并对群众损失进行赔偿。该城市民誉为“天下无比”，产生这种严明纪律的原因，首先是动员深入，连队事先介绍纪律良好的范例，让大家充分认识严格的战场纪律与群众纪律是战斗胜利的重要保证。其次是领导同志重视这一工作，该部政治主任亲自参加纠察队，随先头部队入城检查督促。第三排选纪律优良的干部、战士参加纠察队与工作队，纠察队负责戒严，维持秩序，调查损失，检查户口。工作队担任慰问、赔偿与有组织的收集蒋伪资财。
