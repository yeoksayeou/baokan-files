Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: The Shanghai press reports that U.S. imperialism is preparing to invest heavily in Guangdong to strengthen its economic plunder of China. Pan Yi, General Manager of the U.S. Pan Yi Company, has drafted investment cooperation methods with the Guangdong Chiang government. The scope of investment includes: (1) opening up the Huangpu commercial port; (2) building docks and merchant ships; (3) establishing cotton, silk, and machinery factories; (4) glass factories, rubber factories; (5) agricultural factories; (6) constructing fishing plants; (7) expanding small-scale urban machine handicraft factories. The total investment amounts to 15 million U.S. dollars, with all senior technical personnel being the responsibility of the U.S. side.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th: The Shanghai press reports that Guangzhou's industry and commerce have fallen into a severe crisis under the heavy burden of Chiang's levies and the influx of foreign goods. Factories are closing and suspending operations one after another. At the beginning of the victory, there were two to three hundred cigarette factories, now only about twenty remain. Among the first-class towel, sock, and homespun weaving factories, fifty-six have stopped work and are in a semi-dormant state. Those barely maintaining business are reducing their scale; the number of unemployed male and female workers has reached 35,000. The match and rubber industries, which used to prosper while others declined, are closing down or partially suspending operations due to the Chiang government's suppression of foreign exchange and the difficulty in purchasing raw materials. The gold jewelry industry was forced to suspend operations for more than a month, with each store losing over 20 million Chiang currency. The city's more than 230 gold jewelry stores have lost over 5 billion Chiang currency in total. Currently, only 95 stores have勉强resumed business. Due to the catastrophic decline in the value of Chiang currency and the loss of credibility, large commercial firms still mostly use gold or foreign currency for pricing transactions.

　　美拟在广东大批投资广州工商业危机严重
    【新华社陕北十三日电】沪报讯：美帝国主义已准备在广东大批投资，加强对华经济掠夺。美潘宜公司总经理潘宜已与广东蒋政府草拟投资合作办法，投资范围包括：（一）开辟黄浦商埠；（二）建造船坞及商船；（三）设立棉业、丝业、机器工厂；（四）玻璃厂、胶厂；（五）农业厂；（六）建设渔厂；（七）扩充小型市民机器手工业厂。投资总数的为一千五百万美元，各高级技术人员均由美方负责。
    【新华社陕北十二日电】沪报讯：广州工商业在蒋捐苛重、洋货充塞下已陷入严重危机。工厂纷纷倒闭、停业。胜利初烟厂有二三百家，现只剩二十余家。甲型的毛巾、线袜、土布业织造厂，已有五十六家停工，陷入半睡眠状态。勉强维持业务者，均缩小范围；失业男女职工已达三万五千人。向以众枯独荣的火柴及橡胶工业，因蒋政府压制外汇，原料采购困难，纷纷歇业，或部分停工。金饰业迫令停业月余，每店亏折在蒋币二千万以上，全市金饰店二百三十余家共亏折蒋币五十亿元以上，现勉强复业者仅九十五家。由于蒋币价值惨跌、信用扫地，大商号货款往来仍多以黄金或外币作价。
