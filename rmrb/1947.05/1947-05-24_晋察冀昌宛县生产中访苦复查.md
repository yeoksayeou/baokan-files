Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 20th—Since April 10th, in Ma Paoquan, Lao Ye Gou, and other four villages in Changwan County, Pingxi, under the leadership of county and district cadres, the masses have conducted another land review in conjunction with spring plowing, and the land issue has now been largely resolved. During the review, it was discovered that various village organizations were mostly controlled by feudal forces, and village cadres were mostly manipulated by them, resulting in some landlords maintaining their original status during the movement, and even the main feudal forces not being eliminated. The landlords only offered a small amount of bad land through the "land contribution" method, and the masses reflected: "The landlords keep the good land and still pay a lot of grain, but only reduce the unified tax quota. The peasants have to increase the tax quota and cannot afford it. Distributing the land is not as good as reclaiming wasteland." This review was conducted by district cadres visiting the masses separately while helping them with production during the day, purging the bad elements from various village organizations, and enabling poor peasants to gain leadership. The distribution of land was discussed by the peasants themselves, so that the peasants achieved their goals, recovering 560 mu of good land, plus more than 1,000 mu recovered last year. As a result, the peasants' production enthusiasm has been increased, and all four villages have established production committees and formed 23 labor allocation groups to carry out emergency planting.

　　晋察冀昌宛县生产中访苦复查
    【新华社晋察冀二十日电】平西昌宛县马刨泉、老爷沟等四村，四月十日以来经县区干部领导群众，结合春耕再度进行土地复查，现土地问题大体已获解决。复查中，发现村中各种组织多被封建势力掌握，村干部多被其操纵，致有的地主在运动中仍保持原状，甚至主要封建势力并未消灭。地主仅以“献田”方式拿出少数坏地，群众反映：“地主留下好地，不少打粮食，只是减少统累税分数。农民到增加了纳税分数负担不起，分地还不如垦荒。”此次复查，是区干部白天在帮助群众生产中分头访问，清洗了村中各种组织的坏分子，使贫苦农民掌握领导权。分配土地由农民自己讨论，这样农民才达到目的，收回好地五百六十亩，加上去年共收回土地千余亩。至是，农民生产情绪提高，四村均已成立生产委员会，组成拨工组二十三组进行抢种。
