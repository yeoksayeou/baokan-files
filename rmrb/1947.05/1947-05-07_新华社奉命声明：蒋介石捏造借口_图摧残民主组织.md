　　Xinhua News Agency Authorized Statement:
    Chiang Kai-shek Fabricates Excuses to Destroy Democratic Organizations
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th] Xinhua News Agency is authorized to state: The so-called "CCP Underground Struggle Program Outline" announced by Chiang Kai-shek's rumor-mongering agency, the Central News Agency, on May 2nd, is a 100% fabrication. The person in charge of the CCP Central Committee also told reporters that Chiang Kai-shek had ordered his rumor-mongering agency, the Central News Agency, to repeatedly publish so-called "CCP secret documents," but because they were so absurd and ridiculous as to be unworthy of refutation, we have never issued any statements. The intention of the document published by the Central News Agency this time is obviously to create unwarranted excuses to destroy the organizations of democratic figures such as the Democratic League, the China National Democratic Construction Association, the China Association for Promoting Democracy, the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, and the San Min Chu I Comrades Association. Therefore, we have a moral responsibility to make this statement to people at home and abroad. At the same time, we are making a general statement as an addendum, that all so-called "CCP secret documents" published by the Central News Agency in the past are fabrications without exception.

    蒋介石捏造借口  图摧残民主组织
    【新华社陕北四日电】新华社奉命声明：蒋介石造谣机关中央社于五月二日宣布所谓中共秘密文件“中共地下斗争路线纲领”，系百分之百的捏造。中共中央负责人并告记者称：蒋介石曾令其造谣机关中央社屡次发表所谓“中共秘密文件”，因其荒谬绝伦不值一驳，所以我们从未发表任何声明。此次中央社所发表之文件，其用意显然要造出莫须有的藉口，对民主同盟、民主建国会、民主促进会、工农民主党、三民主义同志联合会等民主人士的组织加以摧残。所以我们有道义上的责任，对中外人士作此声明。同时我们附带的作一总声明，即以往中央社所公布的所谓“中共秘密文件”全部都是造谣，无一例外。
