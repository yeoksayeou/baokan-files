　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, May 15th: Comprehensive reports: Negotiations between the Dutch government and representatives of the Republic of Indonesia have been fruitless due to the Dutch side's breach of faith and refusal to fulfill previously agreed agreements. The situation in Indonesia is currently quite tense. During the negotiations, the Indonesian delegation demanded that the Dutch side fulfill the terms stipulated in the Linggadjati Agreement, namely, to reduce the number of Dutch troops stationed in Indonesia, and that the areas occupied by the Dutch army be transferred to the Republic of Indonesia. At the same time, they rejected the Dutch proposal for "economic cooperation" and the establishment of a central joint institution to control Indonesia's foreign trade. During the negotiations, the Dutch side not only refused to fulfill the agreement, but also continued to send troops to Indonesia. This reactionary conspiracy of Dutch imperialists has aroused great anger among the Indonesian people. The secretary of the Indonesian Republic Youth League recently appealed to the youth of the world, stating: Indonesian youth appeal to the youth of the world to pay attention to the fact that the Netherlands is constantly sending more troops to Indonesia, and this action abominably violates the Dutch-Indonesian agreement. We call on young people to support our demands and stop the Dutch government from transporting troops from Europe to Indonesia. At a conference in Solo, Indonesian Prime Minister Sukarno called on the Indonesian people to consolidate national unity in the struggle against the conspiracies of colonial groups.

　　荷兰继续派遣大军侵入印尼
    印尼人民愤怒
    【新华社陕北十五日电】综合报导：荷兰政府与印尼共和国代表之一周谈判，由于荷方背信弃义拒绝履行既订协定而毫无结果，印尼情势目前仍颇紧张。在谈判中，印尼代表团要求荷方履行井里汶协定所规定之条款，即减少荷兰在印尼之驻军，荷军占领区将移交印尼共和国。同时，并拒绝荷方所提“经济合作”与建立中央联合机构以统制印尼对外贸易之建议。在谈判期间，荷方不但拒绝履行协定，而且继续派遣军队到达印度尼西亚。荷兰帝国主义者此种反动阴谋，引起了印尼人民之极大愤怒。印尼共和国青年联盟书记顷向全世界青年呼吁称：印尼青年吁请全世界青年注意这一事实，即荷兰不断派遣更多的军队到印度尼西亚来，这一行动可恶的破坏了荷兰与印尼的协定。我们号召青年们支持我们的要求，制止荷兰政府从欧洲运兵到印度尼西亚来。在梭罗的一个大会上，印尼总理苏加诺号召印尼人民，在反抗殖民集团阴谋的斗争中，巩固国家之统一。
