　　US House of Representatives Debates "Aid" to Greece and Turkey Plan
    Bender Vigorously Criticizes Truman

    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th: Washington—During the debate in the US House of Representatives on the "Aid to Greece and Turkey Plan" on the 7th, Republican Representative Bender of Ohio vigorously criticized Truman's plan. Bender believes that the new US policy is a malicious conspiracy and an open act of helping reactionary governments fight. He pointed out that the $400 million loan to Turkey and Greece is a prelude to loans to Britain and other countries, which will lead to an increase in domestic prices and inflation in the United States. Bender asked: Does Truman's theory mean that the United States should help France to have a civil war? What is happening in France now? Bender emphasized the matter of former US Ambassador to France Bullitt staying in France and demanded assurances that the United States should not interfere if a civil war breaks out in France.

　　美众院辩论“援”希土方案
    班德猛烈抨击杜鲁门
    【新华社陕北九日电】华府讯：美众院七日对“援助希土计划”的辩论中，俄亥俄州共和党众议员班德猛烈抨击杜鲁门的计划，班德认为美国的新政策是恶毒的阴谋，以及公开的帮助反动政府作战。他指出对土希之四亿元贷款，是对英贷款及对其他国家贷款的序幕，这将造成美国国内物价的增涨与通货的增加。班德问道：杜鲁门的理论是不是意味着在美国帮助下使法国发生内战？法国现在正发生些什么事？班德强调美前驻法大使布立特之逗留法国一事，并要求保证如果法国发生内战，美国应不干涉。
