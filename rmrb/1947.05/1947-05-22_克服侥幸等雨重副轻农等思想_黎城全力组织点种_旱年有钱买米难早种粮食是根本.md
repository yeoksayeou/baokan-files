　　Overcoming Ideas of Luck, Waiting for Rain, Emphasizing Sideline Occupations and Devaluing Agriculture:
    Licheng Fully Organizes Planting
    In a Drought Year it is Difficult to Buy Rice with Money, Early Planting of Grain is Fundamental
    [Our Newspaper Licheng News] In areas of the fifth and sixth districts of this county (mountainous regions), over 90 percent of millet and cotton have already been sown. After finishing planting, Qianwu Village vigorously switched to sideline production, earning 1.3 million yuan in seven days. In Dongyanggua, the Huang Xuji point established a drought resistance committee to organize a planting blitz. However, only some people are carrying water to plant cotton on both sides of the Handan-Changzhi highway, and a few are beginning to plant millet. According to investigations, there are three types of ideas hindering progress: (1) Emphasizing sideline occupations and devaluing agriculture, wanting to plant less land with a "rough and careless approach." (2) Overestimating the labor shortage, with mutual aid wages being relatively high (generally ten catties of rice). In addition, cotton is relatively cheap at the moment, so they do not want to plant more cotton, but are willing to plant simple crops (beans, corn). (3) More widespread and serious is the lax and lucky idea of waiting for rain. In response to this situation, based on the experiences of various places, the leadership proposed the following solutions: (1) Organize the masses to discuss what is the most reliable way for peasants to live? Review whether you could buy rice with money in famine years? Starting from calculations, emphasize that "grain is the most fundamental" and "peasants cannot leave the land" to overcome the masses' ideas of emphasizing sideline occupations and devaluing agriculture. (2) Promote the method of Dong Gouhai in Beishe: "As long as the old, children, and women all exchange labor, there is no need to pay more wages in rice." (Labor for labor). Wang Qinghe and his wife in Xihuangxu use making sesame cakes and spinning cotton to exchange labor for planting land. At the same time, calculations can be made to persuade the masses to appropriately reduce mutual aid wages. An accounting can be made for the masses, although cotton is relatively cheap now, as long as each mu yields 25 catties of raw cotton, it is better than planting millet, and grain prices are only temporarily high. Furthermore, if we want to be self-sufficient in clothing and achieve selling cloth without buying cloth, we must plant more cotton. (3) Like Beishe, let the masses discuss: "If it doesn't rain now even after planting millet, it will still come up. Planting cotton also saves water. If it still doesn't rain until the Little Full and Grain in Ear seasons, what should we do?" Put forward the slogan: "If you should plant the land you cannot wait for rain, if you want to eat you cannot rely on heaven, urgently mobilize, resist drought and plant," organize the masses to help each other, exchange labor, and plant in turns, planting near the land first. Promote the Zizhen "whole team's cotton land according to the distance unified evaluation of labor and accounting methods" (if it rains before and after, the labor will be uniformly borne) to break the idea of waiting for rain and rush to plant. Combining the above ideological solutions, implement education on the principles of production and thrift, establish a long-term concept of drought resistance and famine preparedness, and organize a full-scale drought resistance and planting blitz, especially ensuring the completion of the original plan for cotton. To this end, we should study drought planting techniques, cadres and heroes should take the lead in launching a meritorious service movement, and break through from individual team members to launch a warm drought resistance planting movement.

　　克服侥幸等雨重副轻农等思想
    黎城全力组织点种   
    旱年有钱买米难早种粮食是根本
    【本报黎城讯】本县五、六区一带（山地）谷与棉花有百分之九十以上业已下种，仟仵村下种完毕即大力转上副业生产，七天赚洋一百三十万元；东阳关黄须基点成立抗旱委员会，组织突击下种；但邯长公路两侧仅有部分担水点棉，少数开始种谷，据调查有下列三种思想阻碍：（一）重副轻农，想少种地“粗耕粗作”。（二）过分估计劳力缺乏，互助工资米较高（一般十斤米），加以目前棉花相对便宜，因此不想多种棉花，愿意多种简单作物（豆、玉茭）。（三）更为普遍严重的是松懈侥幸等雨思想。领导上针对此种情况，根据各地经验，领导上提出如下解决办法：（一）组织群众讨论农民生活干啥最可靠？回顾灾荒年有钱能不能买到米？从计算出发强调：“粮食最根本”“农民不离土”，克服群众重副轻农思想。（二）提倡北社董狗孩办法：“只要老汉儿童妇女都变工，就不用多出工资米。”（工对工）西黄须王清河老两口就是用打烧饼纺花变工种地的，同时亦可作过计算说服群众适当降低互助工资。可给群众算个账，虽然目前棉花相对贱，但每亩只要收二十五斤净花，就比种谷强，且粮价上涨是一时的，再说我们要想穿衣自给，作到卖布不买布，就得多种花。（三）像北社一样让群众讨论：“现在种谷还能出来，种花也省水，如果等到小满芒种再不下雨，还种不上该怎么办？”提出：“该种地不能等雨，要吃饭不能靠天，紧急动员起来，抗旱下种”口号，组织群众互助变工，轮流栽种，先栽近地。推广子镇“全组棉花地根据远近统一评工算账办法”（如果下了雨前后用工统一负担），来打破等雨思想抢先下种。结合以上思想解决，贯彻生产节约生产方针教育，对立长期抗旱备荒观念，组织全力进行抗旱突击下种，特别是棉花应保证完成原订计划。为此应研究旱天下种技术，干部英雄带头开展立功运动，从个别队员里突破，开展热烈的抗旱下种运动。（杨柯）
