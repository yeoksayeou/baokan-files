　　[Report from this newspaper, Jinnan, 21st] Women in the Zhentang Third District practice thrift for famine preparedness, stipulating that they will not wear foreign cloth, use foreign thread towels, or use hair oil. Men are stipulated not to smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or eat as many steamed buns. In Sima Village, out of 104 households, 105 people smoke cigarettes. Each person smokes ten cigarettes a day, which costs 256,800 yuan a month. After all members of the farmers' association calculated and discussed, they unanimously decided not to smoke, and each group stipulated rules. The East Xiaoqu District in the First District held an all-cadre meeting to discuss thrift. Everyone believed that if the upper beam is straight, the lower beams will not be crooked, and unanimously agreed that thrift should start with the cadres themselves. Comrade Cui Jijin, who had been emancipated, swore on the spot: "From today onwards, I will not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or eat in restaurants."

　　石窑节约备荒
    提倡掺吃野菜
    【本报冀南二十一日电】振堂三区妇女节约备荒，规定不穿洋布，不使洋线毛巾，不使头油。男人规定不吸纸烟，不喝酒，少吃馒头。四马庄一百零四户，吸纸烟者一百零五人，每人每日吸十支，一个月就需二十五万六千八百元，全体农会员算账讨论后，一致决议不吸，各组都规定了纪律。一区东小区召开全体干部碰头会，讨论节约，大家认为上梁正了下梁才不歪，一致同意节约先从干部本身做起。翻身的崔集锦同志当场宣誓：“我从今天起不吸纸烟，不喝酒，不下饭馆”。
