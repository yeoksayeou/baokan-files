　　Use Wisdom and Technology to Defeat the Enemy!
　　New Creations in Various Units of "Xikang"
　　[This newspaper reports] Comrade Ren Dawei from the front lines in northern Henan reports: Under the call to use wisdom and technology to defeat the enemy, various units of "Xikang" have new creations. The "Fanjiapo" troops, since the Gongguang battle, have been paying attention to the study of tactical issues. Whenever they receive a mission, they convene "Zhuge Liang" meetings between cadres and soldiers, analyze various situations based on the specific mission, and mobilize everyone to think of solutions. When the First Battalion was sweeping away enemy strongholds on the outskirts of Tangyin, they acquired the method of drawing maps on the ground, which proved very effective. In the process of mobilizing people to think of solutions, there were difficulties; for example, some cadres, holding a "must-die" mentality, could not actively think of solutions. After the leadership continuously mobilized and explained that fighting was not for the sake of dying but for the sake of living, the ideological knots were untied, and a widespread enthusiasm for thinking of solutions was created. The study of tactics often continued late into the night. During the day, they practiced siege actions around the houses. After everyone's research, they have summarized a set of experiences on issues such as formation in siege warfare, overcoming obstacles, eliminating bunkers, occupying commanding heights, dealing with enemy "counterattacks," and communication and liaison.
　　[Another dispatch] The "Fanjiapo" troops have made building fortifications a habit. Whenever the troops arrive at a place, regardless of fatigue, they first build fortifications. When the Seventh Squad of the Third Battalion was on guard duty in Dongzhuang, they built a 300-meter-long, four-foot-deep communication trench, individual shelters for all personnel, and machine gun and artillery fortifications in two hours. The enemy fired 107 shells at their position, all of which landed in front of the fortifications. No one was injured or killed, which further strengthened their confidence in victory. Because they paid attention to using technology to defeat the enemy, they greatly reduced casualties in combat. In the Xiqugou battle, the "First Squad of the First Battalion" created a glorious record of one to fifty.
　　[Another dispatch] The "Wangjiapo" artillery company has participated in seven battles since the start of the northern Henan campaign. Each time, they completed their mission with 100% success and with minimal casualties. This is the result of their attention to tactics. To shoot the enemy more effectively, they made a special study of direct-fire shelling. They usually pay attention to the preservation and rigorous inspection of the guns to ensure that no faults occur on the battlefield. In the battle of Xiguan, Jixian County, they fired twenty shells at a distance of 250 meters, with only two deviations. In the Xiqugou battle, they fired twenty-three shells at a distance of 120 meters. Except for two shells that hit the walls, all hit the blockhouses, inflicting great casualties on the enemy. The "Xizang" unit leaders awarded them a fat pig.

　　用智慧与技术战胜敌人！
    “西康”各部有新创造
    【本报讯】豫北前线任大卫同志报导：在用智慧与技术战胜敌人这号召下，“西康”各部均有新的创造。“范家破”部队自公光战斗后，即注意对战术问题的研究。他们每当受领一个任务时，即在干部与战士间，分别召开“诸葛亮”会，根据具体任务，想定各种情况，发动大家想办法。一大队于扫荡汤阴外围敌据点时，这样取得了在地上画地图的办法，收效甚大。在发动想办法过程中、不是没有困难的；如有些干部抱着“必死”的决心，就不能积极去想办法。经领导上不断动员解释，说明打仗不是为了死，而是为了活；思想上的圪瘩解除了，想办法就造成了普遍热潮。钻研战术，往往继续到夜深。白天则围着房子演习攻坚动作。经过大家研究，他们对攻坚战中的队形、克服障碍、消灭地堡、占领制高点、应付敌人的“反扑”、通讯联络诸问题，已总结出一套经验。
    【又讯】“范家坡”部队对做工事已成了一种习惯，部队每到一地不顾一切疲劳，先做工事。三大队七小队在东庄担任警戒时，两小时筑成三百米边长，四尺深深的交通沟，全体人员的单人掩体，及机枪小炮工事。敌人在他们阵地上打了一百零七发炮弹，都落在工事前沿，没有一人伤亡，更增强了他们的胜利信心。由于他们注意了用技术战胜敌人，大大的减少了在战斗中的伤亡，在西曲沟战斗中“一大队一小队”创造了一比五十的光辉纪录。
    【又讯】“王家破”炮兵连自豫北战役开始以来，参加了七次战斗，每次都百分之百的完成任务，而且伤亡极小，这是他们讲求战术的结果。为了更有效的射击敌人，他们对接敌发射炮弹作了专门的研究。平时注意炮的保存和严格检查，做到战场上不发生故障。在汲县西关战斗中，二百五十公尺距离平射二十发，只有两发发生偏差。西曲沟战斗中距离一百二十公尺打炮，打了二十三发。除两发打着围墙，都打中炮楼，给敌人以极大的杀伤，“西藏”部首长特奖给他们肥猪一口。
