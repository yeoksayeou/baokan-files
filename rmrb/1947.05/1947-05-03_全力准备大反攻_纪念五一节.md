　　Fully Prepare for the Great Counter-Offensive
    Commemorating May Day
    Xinhua News Agency Editorial
    The great festival of world workers' solidarity - May Day - has arrived. More than sixty years have passed since the American workers in Chicago initiated May Day in 1886, advocating for the eight-hour work system. In these sixty years, the reactionaries in the world bourgeoisie have become increasingly shameless, and the working class has become increasingly aware. Under the leadership of the working class, the people of the world have become increasingly aware, uniting to fight for their own liberation.

    The world's bourgeois reactionaries transformed into imperialists, launching the First World War, and then into fascists, launching the Second World War. After the Second World War, American imperialists replaced the fascists as the enemy of humanity in the world.

    After the Second World War, American imperialists eagerly sought expansion, wanting to swallow the entire world in one gulp. Their ambitions surpass all bourgeois reactionaries in history, surpassing the British, French, German, and Japanese imperialists who launched the First World War, and also surpassing the German, Italian, and Japanese fascists who launched the Second World War. They want to go to every place in the world, seize everything for their own exclusive possession, not even letting go of the icebergs in Antarctica, the deserts and jungles of inland Africa, or the small country of Nepal in the Himalayas. They want to "feel interested," want to "explore," want to "rescue American military personnel," and want to "sign equal and mutually beneficial trade agreements." As for other places in the world, it goes without saying that they want to find ways to invade them and turn them into appendages of American imperialism. American imperialism is so arrogantly invading the world, yet they shout about "Soviet world expansion." The deceit and shamelessness of American imperialists has reached such a degree that it surpasses all their predecessors.

    For all countries in the world, American imperialists select the most reactionary, most traitorous, and most dictatorial faction and do their best to provide assistance and support. In China, they selected the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group of feudal compradors, warlords, and bureaucrats; in Japan, they selected the pro-fascist Yoshida and his ilk; in Korea, they selected the running dog Syngman Rhee, who had been raised in the United States for more than twenty years; in France, they selected the dictator De Gaulle; in Britain, they selected the reactionary Churchill; in Greece, they selected the Greek emperor; in Hungary, they selected the "Smallholders Party"; and in Spain, they condoned Franco. Whether it is feudal forces, fascist forces, financial oligarchs, or "small landowners," as long as it is the most reactionary faction in that country, there is no problem in receiving the support of American imperialism. The "democratic world" that American imperialism wants is a world of American colonies composed of many countries ruled by the most reactionary factions in each country, a world where the people of all countries are trampled under the feet of reactionaries, and all nations are trampled under the feet of American imperialism – that is the kind of "democratic" and "peaceful" world they want.

    At the same time, in these sixty years, the awakening and growth of the world working class and, under the leadership of the world working class, the awakening and growth of the people of the world have reached an unprecedented level. The creation of the Soviet Union proved to the people of the world that the capitalist system can and should be changed to the socialist system, and that a country with a socialist system built under the leadership of the working class is much better than a country with a capitalist system. The victory of the Soviet Union in the war against German, Italian, and Japanese fascism proved that the socialist system is infinitely stronger than the capitalist system. The creation of the Chinese Liberated Areas and their role in the ten years of civil war and the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan proved that in a backward colony or semi-colony, a new type of democratic country can and should be established under the leadership of the working class. This new democratic system is not only incomparably better than the feudal system, but also much better than the old democratic system. This new democratic system is sufficient to mobilize and unite the strength of the entire nation to achieve the three major goals of national independence, democratic freedom, and people's livelihood. This new democratic system has already been victorious in many countries in Europe, and in many colonial and semi-colonial countries in Asia and the Americas, the people are fighting to realize it. The working class, leading the masses of the people to take back the world they created with their own hands, has accumulated tremendous power. Now the affairs of the world and the affairs of China can no longer be decided solely by the reactionaries; they cannot decide everything alone. Now, in the world and in China, nothing can be done if it does not receive the consent of the people. The power of the people is a decisive factor in the affairs of the world and in the affairs of China.

    Precisely because of this, although American imperialism wants to launch a Third World War, it has already become very difficult.

    Precisely because of this, although the Chinese reactionaries have received the help of American imperialists, and although the Chinese people have not received any help from foreign countries except for moral support, it is absolutely impossible for the American and Chinese reactionaries to turn China into a colony of American imperialism and a fascist hell ruled by the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group.

    The Chinese civil war, launched by the Chinese reactionary Chiang Kai-shek group and aided by American imperialism, is now the most important event determining the fate of China and is also an event that has a significant impact on the world situation. This war has been going on for ten full months (since Chiang Kai-shek tore up the truce order and launched a full-scale offensive last July). Ten months of war have shown that it is completely impossible for the American and Chinese reactionaries to conquer the Chinese people. If Chiang Kai-shek's two hundred and forty-eight brigades, and the United States' four hundred million US dollars, plus the Japanese and puppet assets seized by Chiang Kai-shek can only create a political, economic, and military crisis for Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule, then the reactionaries' dream of conquering the Chinese people will never be realized.

    In March, the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries' bestial hoofs ravaged the democratic holy land of Yan'an. American imperialism hastily praised Chiang Kai-shek, added the title of "democratic" to Chiang Kai-shek's civil war government, and gave it new "aid." It immediately allowed the Chiang Kai-shek government to use three hundred million of the five hundred million loan to supply two hundred and seventy-one naval vessels, and promised more help. The reply to American imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek is the great victory of the People's Liberation Army in Pinghan, Tongpu, Zhengtai, Northeast, Shandong, and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. This victory will continue to develop in May, June, and July, and will directly lead to a fundamental change in the situation between the two armies. That is, the seesaw-like war situation that began in January of this year, from the local offensives of the Chiang army and the local counter-offensives of the People's Liberation Army, will change to the overall defense of the Chiang army and the overall counter-offensive of the People's Liberation Army. Resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely eliminate the two hundred and twenty-three brigades of Chiang Kai-shek who are attacking the Liberated Areas (only twenty-five brigades remain in the rear of the Chiang-controlled areas).

    The revolutionary May has arrived. We, the Chinese people, welcome this month with extremely high confidence in victory. Our task is to mobilize all forces and fully prepare for the great counter-offensive. This counter-offensive will be long-term, so the idea of a quick victory is wrong. Whether in military or economic terms, we must make long-term plans and achieve victory through long-term, comprehensive, and arduous struggle. This counter-offensive may have some twists and turns, because American imperialism will inevitably strengthen its assistance to the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous and fascist group. The intention of American imperialism to directly interfere in China's internal affairs with military force has been shown by the United States' unwillingness to withdraw its troops from our country. In the future, this interference may be strengthened. Therefore, the possibility of certain twists and turns occurring in the counter-offensive process must also be fully estimated. Estimate the long-term nature of the war and the possibility of certain twists and turns to prepare for a comprehensive counter-offensive. Our final victory is certain. Our task is to liberate the suffering Chinese people from the oppression of imperialism and feudal forces. The Chinese people have been fighting for this for a hundred years, and this glorious historical task must be completed in the hands of our generation.

　　全力准备大反攻
    纪念五一节
    新华社社论
    世界工人团结的伟大节日——五一劳动节到了。自从一八八六年美国芝加哥工人发起五一节，提出为八小时工作制而奋斗以来，已经六十余年。这六十余年中，世界资产阶级中的反动派越来越显得无耻，工人阶级就越来越觉悟。在工人阶级的领导之下，世界人民也越来越觉悟；团结起来为自己的解放而斗争。
    世界的资产阶级反动派，变为帝国主义者发动第一次世界大战，又变为法西斯发动第二次世界大战。在第二次世界大战之后，美国帝国主义者就代替了法西斯成为世界人类的敌人。
    美国帝国主义者在第二次世界大战之后，急如星火地寻求扩张，要想一口独吞全世界。他的野心超过历史上所有的资产阶级反动派，超过发动第一次世界大战的英、法、德、日等帝国主义者，也超过发动第二次世界大战的德、意、日法西斯。他要到世界上的一切地方，把一切都抢来为自己独占，连南极的冰山、菲洲内地的沙漠和丛林、希马拉雅山上的小国尼泊尔都不肯放过，都要去“感到兴趣”，都要去“探险”，都要去“救援美军人员”，都去“订立平等互惠商约”。至于世界的其他地方，当然更不待言，要去设法侵略，把它变为美国帝国主义的附庸。美国帝国主义如此狂妄的侵略全世界，然而他们却大喊什么“苏联的世界扩张”。美国帝国主义者的诳骗无耻到这个程度，真是超过了它的一切先辈。
    美国帝国主义者对于世界上一切国家，都挑选最反动的、最卖国的、最独裁的一派尽力给以援助和扶持。在中国挑选了封建买办军阀官僚的蒋介石反动集团，在日本挑选了亲法西斯的吉田等辈，在朝鲜挑选了在美国豢养了二十余年的走狗李承晚，在法国挑选了独裁者戴高乐，在英国挑选了反动派邱吉尔，在希腊挑选了希腊皇帝，在匈牙利挑选了“小地主党”，在西班牙纵容佛朗哥。不管是封建势力、法西斯势力、金融财阀、“小地主”，只要是那一个国家里的最反动的一派，就没有问题的会得到美国帝国主义的扶持。美国帝国主义所要的“民主世界”，就是由各国最反动的一派统治的许多国家联合组成的美国殖民地世界，就是各国人民都被踏在反动派脚下，各民族都被踏在美国帝国主义脚下的那样的“民主”与“和平”的世界。
    同时，在这六十余年中，世界工人阶级的觉悟与力量的增长；在世界工人阶级领导之下，世界人民的觉悟与力量的增长，也到了空前未有的程度。苏联的创立，证明给全世界人看：资本主义制度是可以改变而且应该改变为社会主义制度，在工人阶级领导下可以建成社会主义制度的国家，比资本主义制度国家好得多。苏联在反对德、意、日法西斯的战争中的胜利证明：社会主义制度比资本主义制度强固得无数倍。中国解放区的创立及其在十年内战与八年抗日战争中的作用证明：在工人阶级领导之下，在落后的殖民地、半殖民地也可以而且应该建立一种新式的民主主义国家。这种新的民主主义制度，比封建制度固然好得不可比拟，比旧的民主主义制度也好得多。这种新民主主义制度，足以发动和团结全民族的力量来实现民族独立、民权自由、民生幸福的三大目标。这种新的民主主义制度在欧洲许多国家中已经胜利，在亚洲、美洲的许多殖民地、半殖民地国家中，人民正为其实现而斗争。工人阶级领导人民群众以自己的手争回自己所创造的世界，积聚了极其巨大的力量。现在世界的事情，中国的事情，已经不能再由反动派独断独行，由他们单独来决定一切了。现在在全世界、在中国，一切事情如果不得到人民的同意，是一定办不通的了。人民的力量在世界的事情中，在中国的事情中，是有决定性的因素了。
    正因为如此，美国帝国主义虽然要想发动第三次世界大战，但是已很困难了。
    正因为如此，中国反动派虽然得到了美国帝国主义者的帮助，中国人民虽然除了道义的声援以外从外国得不到任何帮助，但是中美反动派要想把中国变为美国帝国主义的殖民地，变为蒋介石反动集团独裁统治的法西斯地狱，乃是绝对不可能的了。
    由中国反动派蒋介石集团发动的，由美国帝国主义帮助的中国大内战，现在是决定中国命运的最重要的事件，也是对于世界形势发生重大作用的事件。这个战争到今天已经足足进行了十个月（从去年七月蒋介石撕毁停战令，发动全面进攻算起）。十个月的战争表现出来：中美反动派要想征服中国人民是完全不可能的。如果蒋介石的二百四十八个旅，和美国的四十万万美金，加上蒋介石所劫收的日伪财产仅能造成蒋介石反动统治的政治、经济、军事的危机，那末反动派征服中国人民的梦想是永远不会实现的了。
    三月里蒋介石反动派的兽蹄蹂躏了民主圣地延安，美国帝国主义对于蒋介石连忙加以称赞，和给蒋介石的内战政府加上“民主”的称号，给以新的“援助”；立即让蒋介石政府动用五亿借款中的三亿，供给二百七十一艘海军船只，并且答应更多的帮助。对于美国帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石的答复，就是人民解放军在平汉、同蒲、正太、东北、山东和陕甘宁边区的大胜利。这种胜利将在五、六、七等月继续发展下去，且直达到两军形势的根本改变。就是由今年一月开始的拉锯式的战争形势，由蒋军的局部进攻与人民解放军的局部反攻，改变到蒋军的全面防御与人民解放军的全面反攻。坚决、彻底、干净、全部地消灭蒋介石进攻解放区的二百二十三个旅（仅有二十五个旅留在蒋管区后方）。
    革命的五月到来了，我们中国人民以极高的胜利信心来迎接这个月份。我们的任务就是：动员一切力量，全力准备大反攻。这个反攻将是长期的，因此速胜的观念是不对的；不论在军事方面和经济方面，都要作长期的打算，在长期的全面的艰苦奋斗中取得胜利。这个反攻可能会有某些曲折，因为美国帝国主义必然加强对蒋介石卖国贼、法西斯集团的援助，美国帝国主义直接以军事力量干涉中国内政的意图，已从美国不肯从我国撤兵中表现出来，今后这种干涉还可能加强。因此反攻过程中发生某些曲折的可能性，也必须充分的估计到。估计到战争的长期性，和发生某些曲折的可能性，来准备全面的反攻。我们的最后胜利是肯定的。我们的任务是要把苦难重重的中国人民，从帝国主义与封建势力的压迫下解放出来。中国人民为此奋斗已经一百年之久，这个光荣的历史任务一定在我们这一代人手里获得完成。
