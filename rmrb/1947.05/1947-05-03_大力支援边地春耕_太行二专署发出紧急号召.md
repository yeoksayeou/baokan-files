　　Vigorously Support Spring Farming in Border Areas
    Taihang Second Administrative Office Issues Emergency Appeal
    [This newspaper reports] According to Comrade Fan Yusheng, Commissioner of the Taihang Second Administrative Office: Spring farming is extremely difficult in the border areas of Yuci, Taiyuan, Qi County, and west of the Yuci-Taiyuan-Qi County Road. Currently, 30,000 people are without food. Although they are striving to help themselves, they lack the ability to carry out spring farming. There is an extreme shortage of livestock, with each animal having to plow an average of six *qing* of land, and generally two to three *qing*. In addition, the looting by the Chiang-Yan troops has left the people with virtually nothing. Some autumn harvests have not yet been collected. Losses in farm tools and clothing exceed 450,000 yuan, and grain losses amount to 460,000 *shi*. Nearly 10,000 head of livestock have been seized. The people's lives are difficult, and diseases are rampant, with a severe shortage of medicine. The militia also lacks bullets needed to protect the fields and homes in their struggles. In view of this situation, the Second Administrative Office issues the following emergency appeal: (1) Appeal to the people in the interior to uphold the spirit of "all farmers under heaven are one family" and vigorously assist the 30,000 people in the border areas. Each person needs two *dou* of grain to get through the spring farming season (a total of 6,000 *shi*). If each of the 700,000 people in our interior saves one *sheng* of millet, the difficulties can be completely overcome. (2) Make the most of the different planting times in the border and interior areas, and squeeze out livestock and manpower to support the border areas. The border and interior areas should work together to ensure that not an inch of land is left uncultivated. (3) Organize medical teams to go to the border areas to treat diseases, in order to ensure the health of the labor force and carry out spring farming. (4) The militia in the interior should strive to save bullets to support the militia in the border areas in their fighting.
