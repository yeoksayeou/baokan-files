　　Elementary School Students Can Handle Big Tasks
　　Teachers and Students in Various Schools Universally Participate in Production
　　[This Newspaper Comprehensive Report] Teachers and students in primary and secondary schools in various places have universally thrown themselves into the wave of production. All teachers and students of Taihang No. 1 Middle School specifically calculated the land area of military families stationed in the village and the school's labor force, helping to deliver manure. On the first day, more than fifty students delivered a total of more than one hundred and ten loads of manure. Wu'an No. 8 High School organized a shock spring plowing mutual aid production team to go to the countryside to help the masses with production. They were divided into eight small teams according to base points, combining with the elementary schools at each base point, and put forward the slogan "Production and study are excellent, and current affairs publicity must be done." Each team also formulated a production study plan and conducted challenge competitions. All schools in Zuoquan had holidays to focus on spring plowing. Hongxing Elementary School in Shangwu divided students into 14 production study groups according to family mutual assistance. They produced in the afternoon and studied in the morning, noon, and evening. The evening class focused on production, teaching what they did during the day, so as to closely integrate production and study. The whole village planned to finish delivering manure and harrowing corn and black beans in seven days, but they completed it in five days. Students from Shahe No. 2 High School planted more than 20 mu of cotton in one and a half days. The teacher of Huguan No. 1 Primary School led more than 50 students staying at school to go to Nanguan to help military families deliver manure, remove stubble, and plant millet. Four or five elementary school students pulled a cart of manure together, and the military families happily said, "Elementary school students are doing big things." More than 140 elementary school students from Sunjiakou in Jinnan, led by teachers, participated in the river management project, picking up more than 10,000 jin of firewood for the river project alone, helping the government complete the plan of not assigning firewood for river management.
