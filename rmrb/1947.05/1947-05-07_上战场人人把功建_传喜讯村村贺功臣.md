　　【Our Special Dispatch】Frontline soldiers valiantly perform meritorious deeds for the people, and the masses in the rear enthusiastically celebrate. In Tongtan Town, Zuoquan, on April 23rd, during a mule and horse fair attended by 5,000 people, Comrade Yao Laifu, who bravely killed the enemy, was congratulated for his meritorious service. Amidst shouts of "Add merit upon merit" and "Double the joy," the merit plaque and the family members of the hero were welcomed into the venue. More than 10,000 eyes were fixed on the hero's family members, who were in their sixties, arousing infinite respect and love from the masses. Some military dependents said, "I hope my son will kill more enemies and make great contributions, so we can also be celebrated. How glorious would that be!" Labor Hero Jia Fukuai said, "Frontline soldiers make great contributions, and I will make small contributions in the rear. I will lead the masses to produce more grain to support the front lines and take good care of the military dependents." After receiving a letter of commendation for Comrade Guo Guifang from Paiheng Village in Pingshun, the masses were extremely excited, considering it an honor for the whole village, and they hung a plaque to celebrate the hero's family. The village chief of Chengguan Village excitedly said at the celebration meeting, "Li Changfu from our village killed more than 30 'doomed soldiers' in one go during the Zhangzhuang battle in Anhui. Lu Desheng ensured that the troops were well-fed in the front lines regardless of the difficulties. They have all made great contributions, which is a great honor for our village." In Wangbao Village, Shexian, Comrades Yang Qinggong and Zhou Zhengqing were awarded the Second Class Hero in Killing the Enemy of the entire brigade during the self-defense war. At the celebration meeting, the masses from each village presented the hero's families with honorary plaques of "Hero in Killing the Enemy" and "People's Hero." Guo Zhangbao and Cao Shouhai from Jingyu Village, Lucheng, bravely participated in the assault squad during the Shangguan Village battle in Hua County, breaking through three enemy blockades and gloriously completing the task of checking the line three times despite the dense bullets. They made great contributions. During the district-wide celebration meeting, the people of Jingyu Village sang, "Two heroes in one village, reporting merit at the same time, everyone praises, the whole district celebrates." In Huguan County, there were already 28 heroes, and the democratic government held a celebration meeting for thousands of people in the city on April 17th, with plaque parades, which inspired 70 young people to request joining the army and making contributions. More than 5,000 people in Cejing Village, Shahe, hung plaques to celebrate the heroes Gao Wuchang and Wang Laosan. (Fu Wen, Xiu Zeng, Huo Lin, Zhen Guo, Fu Sheng, Deng Ying, Tu Chang, Fu Jin, Wang Jian, Zeng Lu, Wan Yi, Jian Yu, Ying Shan, Cong Lie, Er Fu, Ru Long, Liang Bi, Xiang Cun, Qing Fu, Xue Fu, Yun Bei, Lin Sheng, Zhuo Min, Jiao Long, Qing Yun, Shi Ze)
　　
　　【Another Dispatch】Comrade Guo Kairong, a soldier from Nantianhe Village, had fought in five major battles on the Hebei-Shandong-Henan front, especially in the Wanglou battle, where he bravely charged and seized a heavy machine gun and captured many bullets, earning him the title of Hero in Killing the Enemy of the entire company. After the unit's commendation form was sent to the village, everyone in the village was happy and built a colorful stage to hold a grand celebration meeting. The county and district governments sent special personnel to carry congratulatory reports and couplets to celebrate. After the letter from the front was read aloud on the stage, three old men discussed in the southeast corner of the venue, "Kairong is very honest and a bit dull, but I didn't expect him to make such a great contribution." Another old man followed up, "So many people come to celebrate, it's even more glorious than passing the imperial examination as the top scholar or second place. To be able to do this in life, that's enough." An old man nodded and said, "You can't judge a person by their appearance. Kairong may not be good at talking, but he can do great things." At this time, the hero of land reform, Cao Linshui, said on the stage, "I led everyone to turn over a new leaf for a winter, but I only dug up some grass roots (small special agents, small landlords). Guo Kairong is digging up the old roots (referring to Chiang Kai-shek) on the front lines, his contribution is much greater than mine. He is our village's martial arts champion, the glory of our village, we must learn from him." As soon as he finished speaking, Wang Liuze, a model militiaman from Nantianhe who had just been allocated eight acres of land, six houses, and had only been married for two days, jumped on the stage to sign up for the army. Then, Guo Chunxing, another young militiaman, immediately signed up for the army on the spot. Finally, the entire team lined up to Guo Kairong's door to hang a large plaque, post congratulatory reports, paste couplets, make merry, and set off cannons. Men, women, old and young, congratulated the Kairong family, and the meeting did not end until sunset.
