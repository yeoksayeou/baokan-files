　　Indian Farmers
    British direct rule over India has lasted for more than 150 years. In order to make India a permanent market for British goods and a supplier of industrial raw materials, the old feudal system has been maintained. The landlord class remains the master of the countryside, and farmers still account for 89 percent of the national population.
    The concentration of land in India is astonishing. In Madras Province, 136 landlords own 6.12 million hectares of land, while in Bombay, 125 landlords own 500,000 acres of land each. Between the big landlords and the tenants who directly cultivate the land, there are so-called "intermediaries" (similar in nature to China's "second landlords"). Some landlords' land reaches the tenants through as many as 50 "intermediaries," and each additional layer increases exploitation. On the other hand, in Madras Province mentioned above, 30 million farmers each have less than five acres of land, and in Punjab Province, farmers with less than one acre to less than ten acres account for more than 70 percent. However, to maintain the Indian standard of living, each person needs at least ten to fifteen acres of land.
    Landlords' various exploitations and usury have left the Indian people heavily indebted. In Punjab Province, among 437,333 landowners, only 17 percent are not in debt. Among 4,000 permanent tenants, only 20 percent are not in debt, and among ordinary tenants, only 27 percent are not in debt. The import of British capital and the dumping of British goods have bankrupted Indian handicrafts, and a large number of unemployed workers have poured into the countryside to engage in the production of industrial raw materials needed by British capitalism. But they do not have an inch of land and immediately become the unemployed army in agriculture, further creating favorable conditions for landlords to exploit farmers. They can evict farmers from the land at any time.
    But the Indian people have recognized their own path. In the Indian Peasants' Association led by the Communist Party of India, Indian Muslims and Hindus get along very well. Its membership has grown from 800,000 in 1945 to 1.5 million now. When the Indian Peasants' Conference was held in 1945, people of all nationalities participated, of which women accounted for one-tenth. The conference called on farmers to organize. At that time, Joshi, the general secretary of the Communist Party of India, delivered a speech saying: "When the peasant movement can mobilize the relatively backward rural women, there is no force in the world that can destroy it... It will be victorious!" (Research Office)

　　印度的农民
    英国对印度的直接统治已有一百五十多年，为着要使印度永远成为英国商品的销售市场和工业原料的供给地，旧的封建制度一直被保留下来，地主阶级依旧是农村的主宰者，农民仍占全国人口的百分之八十九。
    印度土地集中情形是十分惊人的，在马德拉斯省，一三六个地主拥有土地六一二万公顷，孟买一二五个地主每人有土地五十万英亩。在大地主与直接耕种土地的佃农之间，有所谓“借地人”（和中国的“二地主”性质一样），有些地主的土地到达佃农手里，经过“借地人”达五十个之多，每多一层，便增加一层剥削。另方面，在上述马德拉斯省，三千万农民每人土地则不到五英亩，旁遮普省从不满一英亩到具有不及十英亩土地的农民，占百分之七十以上。但要维持印度生活水平，每人至少要有十至十五英亩土地。
    地主种种剥削及高利贷，使印度人民负债累累。旁遮普省四三七三三个有地农民，不负债者仅百分之十七。四千个永久佃户，仅有百分之二十，普通佃农则仅有百分之二十七。英国资本的输入及其商品的倾销，更使印度手工业破产，大批失业工人流入农村，从事英国资本主义所需要的工业原料之生产。但他们没有寸土尺地，立刻变成了农业中的失业军，更造成地主对农民剥削的有利条件。他们随时可以将农民驱离土地。
    但是印度人民已认清了自己的道路，在印共所领导的印度农民协会中，印回族农民相处极为融洽，其会员已由一九四五年的八十万发展到现在的一百五十万。一九四五年召开印度农民大会时，参加者有各民族，其中妇女占十分之一，大会号召农民组织起来。当时印共总书记约希发表演说称：“当农民运动能把比较落后的乡村妇女动员起来的时候，世界上就没有力量能够摧毁它……它将获得胜利！”（资料室）
