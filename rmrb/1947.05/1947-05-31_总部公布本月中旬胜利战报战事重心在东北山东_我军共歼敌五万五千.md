Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, May 29th: The General Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army announced a battle report for May 11th to 20th, stating that the focus of the battles this ten-day period was in the Shandong and Northeast Liberated Areas. In other liberated areas, either small victories were won through continuous attacks, or preparations were being made for new counter-offensives. In these ten days, more than six brigades of Chiang Kai-shek's regular army (at or above the regimental/battalion level) were annihilated, and a total of over 55,000 Chiang and puppet troops were wiped out. Five counties were recovered and liberated: Shuangshan, Huaide, Weichang, Changli, and Funing, for a total of seven cities when combined with Mengcheng and Weichuan which were liberated earlier in the month, but not previously announced.

    In Shandong: After the 72nd Division was annihilated, Chiang Kai-shek, disregarding the life or death of his subordinates, strictly ordered the Tang Enbo, Ou Zhen, and Wang Jingjiu Groups to advance north at great risk. When the Tang Group was advancing along the Yimeng Highway from Mengyin towards Tanbu, about 50 li northeast of Mengyin, attempting to invade Yishui and Ju County, we immediately launched a counter-attack. From the 14th to the 16th, in the Menglianggu area, 60 li southeast of Mengyin, Chiang's Model Army, the 74th Division, was completely annihilated, and the 57th Regiment of the 19th Brigade of the 83rd Division was also completely wiped out. Zhang Lingfu, commander of the 74th Division, and more than 9,000 other officers and soldiers, became meaningless sacrifices to Chiang Kai-shek's civil war policy; more than 15,000, from brigade commanders down, laid down their weapons. At the same time, we repelled multiple reinforcements from the 7th Division, 25th Division, 65th Division, 83rd Division, and 11th Division, annihilating more than 4,000 of them. After suffering this blow, the Chiang army had to busy itself with restoring lost ground, and its original plan of advancing on three routes, east, west, and south, suffered a major setback.

    On the 13th, another unit of the Shandong People's Liberation Army liberated Yancheng Station, more than 30 kilometers northwest of Jinan, and annihilated all 1,600+ troops of Chiang's puppet Li Lianxiang.

    The Northeast People's Liberation Army launched a powerful summer offensive simultaneously in Eastern, Western, and Southern Manchuria.

    Eastern Manchuria: On the 16th, we liberated Tiangang, Youjiatun, Jiangmifeng and other stations east of Jilin, annihilating the entire 113th Regiment of the New 38th Division of the New 1st Army. On the 19th, we recovered Ula Street, an important stronghold north of Jilin, and Laoye Ridge, an important stronghold east of Jilin, annihilating the entire 112th Regiment of the New 38th Division. The Chiang army in Jilin is now in our arc-shaped encirclement.

    Western Manchuria: After recovering the Glass Mountain Station north of Liaoyuan on the 13th, we recovered Shuangshan City, 40 kilometers northeast of Liaoyuan, on the 15th, annihilating one battalion of the 259th Regiment of the 87th Division of Chiang's 71st Army, and then recaptured Wohutun Station, approaching Liaoyuan City (Note: Liaoyuan City was recovered on the 24th). On the 16th, Huaide City, 40 kilometers west of Changchun, was captured, and the defending enemy, the 90th Regiment of the New 30th Division of the New 1st Army and the 17th Security Regiment, were completely eliminated. On the 18th, the 91st Division and 88th Division of the 71st Army were annihilated in the suburbs of Huaide City. In this battle, more than 4,000 Chiang soldiers, including Feng Yunmin, the chief of staff of the 71st Army, were killed or wounded, and more than 11,200 were captured alive. On the 19th, we continued to recover the important stronghold on the Changchun-Shenyang Railway, Gongzhuling, more than 150 li southwest of Changchun. Thus, we completely controlled 150 li of the railway trunk line between Changchun and Gongzhuling. The Chiang army in Changchun was terrified.

    Southern Manchuria: On the 10th and 11th, we successively recovered the three stations of Beishanchengzi, Caoshi, and Heishantou on the Jilin-Shenyang line, annihilating the 552nd Regiment of the 184th Division of Chiang's 60th Army, and one battalion and two companies of the 550th Regiment, one battalion of the 3rd Regiment of the Provisional 20th Division, two companies of the 10th Engineer Regiment, and one security regiment. On the 14th, near Caoshi, we annihilated one battalion of the 160th Regiment of the 54th Division of the 13th Army, which was reinforcing from Qingyuan. On the 15th, Liao Yaoxiang personally led the New 22nd Division, two regiments of the Provisional 20th Division of the 93rd Army, and one regiment of the 54th Division of the 13th Army, a total of six regiments, to reinforce the Nanshanchengzi area. From the 16th to the 17th, we defeated them, capturing more than 1,000 soldiers from the New 22nd Division. In this battle, more than 1,000 Chiang soldiers were killed or wounded, and more than 4,000 were captured. The Jilin-Shenyang traffic was cut off.

    The Rehe and Eastern Hebei People's Liberation Army also launched offensives, echoing the counter-offensive in the Northeast. On the 16th, Rehe recovered Weichang County, 100 kilometers northwest of Chengde, annihilating the 10th Regiment of the 4th Division of Chiang's 13th Army and a part of the bandits, a total of more than 1,200 people. Qipanshan, an important stronghold 50 li north of Weichang, was also captured, and the battle results are expanding. On the 18th, Eastern Hebei captured Changli City and the nearby Zhangjiazhuang, Liushouying, and Houfengtai stations on the Beining Railway in one fell swoop, annihilating more than 1,000 Chiang puppet troops. On the same day, the Chiang army in Funing, northeast of Changli, fled upon hearing the news, and the city was recovered by us. Chiang's attempt to eliminate our army in Eastern Hebei within a limited time has become a bubble.

    Since the Panlong Victory, the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia People's Liberation Army has been actively attacking the rear of Hu Zongnan's army. On the 11th, Jinpenwan, 90 li southeast of Yan'an, was recovered, annihilating more than 300 people from the Second General Team of the Shaanxi Self-Defense Force. Yanzhen, Yunyan and other places were successively recovered by us. On the 17th, Tuqiao Town, northeast of Xunyi in Guanzhong, was captured, and we advanced towards Xunyi City. (Note: Xunyi was recovered on the 22nd.) Since Hu Zongnan's army scurried back from Suide to Panlong, not only failed to relieve the 167th Brigade, but instead wandered back and forth like rice on a sieve, with hundreds being lost every day. Currently, the main force of Hu Zongnan is all concentrated in the area from Panlong, Qinghuabian to Guaimao, and is in a great dilemma where it is difficult to advance or retreat.

　　总部公布本月中旬胜利战报战事重心在东北山东
  　我军共歼敌五万五千
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】人民解放军总部公布五月十一日至二十日战报称：本旬战事重心在山东与东北两解放区；其他解放区或不断出击小胜，或正准备新的反攻。在这十天中，歼灭蒋正规军团营以上的兵力六个旅以上，歼蒋伪军共五万五千余人。收复和解放县城双山、怀德、围场、昌黎、抚宁五座，连上旬未公布的蒙城、洧川共七城。
    山东方面：蒋介石在七十二师被歼后，仍不顾其部属的死活，严令汤恩伯、欧震、王敬久三集团冒险北进。当汤集团正由蒙阴沿沂蒙公路向蒙阴东北五十余里的坦埠进攻，图犯沂水、莒县的时候，我即予以反击。由十四日至十六日，在蒙阴东南六十里之孟良崮地区，将蒋之模范军七十四军彻底歼灭，八十三师十九旅之五十七团亦被全歼。七十四师师长张灵甫与其他官兵九千余人，一同做了蒋介石内战政策无意义的牺牲品；放下武器者旅长以下一万五千余人。同时我又击退七师、二十五师、六五师、八十三师、十一师等部多次增援，歼其四千余。蒋军受此打击后，乃不得不忙着恢复已失阵地，其原先东、西、南三路并进的计划，已受重大挫折。
    十三日，山东解放军另一部，解放济南西北三十余公里之晏城车站、歼蒋伪李连祥全部千六百余人。
    东北解放军本旬在东、西、南满同时发动强大夏季攻势。
    东满：十六日我解放吉林以东之天岗、尤家屯、江密峰等车站，歼新一军新三十八师一一三团全部。十九日收复吉林以北重要据点乌拉街，与吉林以东重要据点老爷岭，歼新三十八师一一二团全部。吉林蒋军已处我弧形包围中。
    西满：十三日收复辽源北之玻璃山车站后，十五日又收复辽源东北四十公里的双山城，歼蒋七十一军八十七师二五九团一个营，旋又克复卧虎屯车站，并迫近辽源城（按：辽源城已于二十四日收复）。十六日攻克长春以西四十公里之怀德城，守敌新一军新三十师九十团及保十七团完全消灭。十八日又歼灭七十一军之九十一师、八十八师于怀德城郊。是役共击毙伤蒋军七十一军参谋长冯运民以下四千余名，生俘一万一千二百余人。十九日继续收复长沈路重要据点、长春西南百五十余华里的公主岭。至是我已完全控制长春至公主岭间铁路干线百五十里。长春蒋军恐慌万状。
    南满：我十、十一日相继收复吉沈线上之北山城子、草市、黑山头三车站，歼蒋六十军一八四师五五二团，及五五零团之一个营又两个连，暂二十师三团一个营，工兵十团两个连，又一个保安团。十四日于草市附近又歼十三军五十四师由清源北援之一六零团一个营。十五日，廖耀湘亲率新二十二师、九十三军暂二十师之两个团，十三军五十四师一个团，共六个团向南山城子一带出援。十六日至十七日，我将其击溃，俘新二十二师千余人。是役共毙伤蒋军千余人，俘四千余人。吉沈交通为之切断。
    热河、冀东解放军亦发动攻势，与东北反攻互相呼应。十六日热河收复承德西北一百公里之围场县城，歼蒋十三军四师十团及土匪一部，共千二百余人。围场以北五十里之重要据点棋盘山，亦告克复，战果正扩大中。十八日，冀东一举攻克北宁路上之昌黎城及附近之张家庄、留守营、后封台三车站，歼蒋伪军千余。同日昌黎东北抚宁之蒋军闻风逃窜，该城当为我收复。蒋军限期肃清冀东我军企图，已成泡影。
    陕甘宁解放军自蟠龙大捷后，又积极出击胡军后方。十一日收复延安东南九十里之金盆湾，歼陕西自卫第二总队三百余人。淹真、云岩等地续为我收复。十七日克关中旬邑东北之土桥镇，并进迫旬邑城。（按旬邑已于二十二日收复）而胡军自从绥德向蟠龙回窜后，不但未能解一六七旅之危，反之来回游行像筛上之米，漏掉者每日以数百计。现胡之主力全部集结于蟠龙、青化砭至拐峁一带，已处于进退两难的极大困境。
