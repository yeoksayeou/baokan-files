　　“May Fourth”
    “I am the rebellion festival,
    The vanguard festival,
    The mobilization festival!
    Children, the time has come!
    The wind is the bugle,
    The sea is the whistle,
    Lightning is the command saber,
    Thunder is the war drum,
    Those ready to burn, prepare to burn,
    Those ready to explode, prepare to explode,
    Unite all those who are not free to fight for freedom,
    Unite all those who have no democracy to fight for democracy,
    Those with knives, take out your knives,
    Those with guns, shoulder your guns,
    Those with landmines, bury your landmines,
    Those without knives,
    Without guns,
    Without landmines,
    Wave your fists,
    Those with broken hands,
    Those with broken feet,
    Shout with your voices!
    Children,
    Aim your knives at the feudal, autocratic tradition,
    Aim your fire at the corrupt, degenerate, reactionary, dictatorial clique!
    March forward,
    Take over democracy,
    Take over science,
    Return the rights of freedom to the people.
    Turn the joy of happiness to the common people,
    Darkness is fading,
    The dawn bugle has sounded,
    Children,
    Stand on my shoulders and welcome the red sun.”

　　“五四”
    “我是叛变节，
    先锋节，
    号召节！
    孩子们是时候了！
    风是号角，
    海是哨音，
    电闪是指挥刀，
    雷鸣是战鼓，
    燃烧的准备燃烧，
    爆裂的准备爆裂，
    联合起一切不自由的人争自由，
    联合起一切没民主的人争民主，
    有尖刀的拿出尖刀来，
    有枪的扛起枪，
    有地雷的埋下地雷，
    没刀的，
    没枪的，
    没地雷的，
    舞拳头挥击，
    断手的，
    断脚的，
    用声音呐喊！
    孩子们，
    对准那封建专制传统开刀，
    对准那贪污、腐化、反动、独裁的集团射击！
    挺向前，
    把民主接过，
    把科学接过，
    把自由的权利让给人民。
    把幸福的欢笑转给老百姓，
    黑暗已在褪色，
    黎明号音已响，
    孩子们，
    站在我肩上迎接那红太阳。”
