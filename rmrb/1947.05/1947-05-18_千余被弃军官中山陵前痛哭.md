Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: An Associated Press dispatch from Nanjing on the 13th reports: Over a thousand retired military officers (including discharged officers and approximately four hundred generals from the "Central Training Corps") are launching a movement to protest the Chiang government's neglect of their interests, and are weeping before Sun Yat-sen's tomb. These unemployed retired officers, most of whom are unable to make a living, complained during a memorial ceremony for Sun Yat-sen that their service to the revolution and the War of Resistance had been completely forgotten by the Chiang central government. These people, wearing tattered military uniforms (some still bearing medals and decorations), bowed to Sun Yat-sen's tomb, appealing to his spirit in heaven to witness their current suffering. A former general said, "If the central government wants us to live, they should give us a bowl of rice; if they want us to die, they should give us a coffin."

　　千余被弃军官中山陵前痛哭
    【新华社陕北十四日电】美联社南京十三日电：一千余退职军官（包括退伍军官及“中央训练团”约四百名将官）正发起反对蒋政府忽视他们利益的运动，并至孙中山墓前痛哭。这些失业的大多数无法糊口的退伍军官们，在纪念孙中山仪式中，抱怨他们对于革命以及抗战之服务完全为蒋中央政府忘记。这些身着破旧军装（有些人还佩带勋章奖章）的人们，向孙中山墓鞠躬，吁请孙氏在天之灵做他们目前痛苦的天上之目睹者。一个前将级军官说：“假如中央政府愿意我们活下去，他们应该给我们一碗饭吃；假如他们愿意我们死，他们应该给我们棺材。”
