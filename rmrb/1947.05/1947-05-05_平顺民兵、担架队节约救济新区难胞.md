　　Pingshun Militia and Stretcher Team Save and Relieve New District Refugees Through Thrift
    [Our newspaper, Taihang, 2nd dispatch] The Pingshun 3rd and 4th district militia and stretcher teams were stationed in the Tangyin ×× area on the Yu Bei (Northern Henan) front. Seeing the masses suffering from the devastation of the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops and living in extreme poverty, they initiated a "Saving and Relieving Disaster Movement." The two teams from the two districts, totaling one thousand two hundred and forty-nine people, saved a total of six hundred and forty-four jin of millet, which was handed over to the Tangyin First District Office to be distributed to the masses. They also spent two days helping the masses weed 125 mu of wheat. Because of the difficulty in obtaining firewood in that area, the masses were unable to supply it, so they assigned 345 people to specialize in cutting firewood. In two days, they cut back 8,259 jin, which not only reduced the burden on the local masses, but also saved 48,200 yuan. The local masses were greatly moved and said, "You are still the people from the old base area, you truly have understanding! If you have any difficulties in the future, just speak up." They also sent representatives to visit each team to express their gratitude, and everyone was extremely harmonious.
    [Our newspaper, Taihang dispatch] The stretcher-bearers of the 3rd sub-district, Hu and Ping militias, care for the wounded very thoughtfully. Guo Laiyou, Cui Pangze, and others from the first and second districts of Huguan Stretcher Brigade take care of the wounded like family, going uphill and downhill facing upwards, giving their own rations to the wounded, and helping them with their bodily functions. When it was summed up, thirty-three people were commended. The 3rd Battalion militia escorted prisoners of war, and a squad of the 7th Company said, "The Chiang Kai-shek deputy brigade commanders are now under our command!" They escorted the officers for five days and did not feel tired at all. (Shi Duan, Zhi Qing, Xue Kong)

　　平顺民兵、担架队节约救济新区难胞
    【本报太行二日电】平顺三，四区民兵、担架队在豫北前线汤阴××一带驻扎，见群众受着蒋伪军摧残、生活极苦、特发起“节约救灾运动”，两区两个队一千二百四十九人，共节约了小米六百四十四斤，交给汤阴第一区公所分给群众。他们并用二天时间帮助群众锄麦一百廿五亩。那一带烧柴困难，群众供应不来，便抽出三百四十五人专门砍柴，两天即砍回八千二百五十九斤，不仅减轻了当地群众的负担，而且节省了四万八千二百余元。当地群众大受感动的说：“还是老根据地的人，真有认识！以后你们有什么困难，说话就行”。并派代表到各队慰问，大家极为和谐。
    【本报太行讯】三分区壶、平民兵担架，爱护伤员十分周到。壶关一、二区担架大队郭来有、崔胖则等，爱护彩号，和亲人一样，上下坡头朝上，自己干粮送给彩号吃，帮助他大小便，天冷脱下衣服给彩号盖上。总结时有三十三人记功表扬。三营民兵押送俘虏，七连一排说：“蒋介石正副旅长，现由咱指挥哩！”他们押送军官走了五天，一点也不觉得疲劳。（士端、之庆、学孔）
