　　Giddy and Muddled
    American warlords, made giddy by their ambition to annex the world, have become more and more muddled over the past year, practically to the point of madness! MacArthur said to Admiral Denfeld, Commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet: "If a free vote were held, ninety percent of Japanese would favor turning Japan into a U.S. territory." (United Press) This is a typical example.

    MacArthur's remarks expose the American imperialists' ambition toward Japan, which is to annex Japan. The "democracy" and "freedom" spoken of by American imperialism are all lies.

    MacArthur thinks that all Japanese are like Shigeru Yoshida, a reactionary who can send people to MacArthur's headquarters every day to call him "Apusan" (i.e., father); just as they thought that the Chinese people were all like the Chiang Kai-shek clique, who could regard the United States as their "motherland." The facts are exactly the opposite of MacArthur's view. Shigeru Yoshida and these reactionaries represent an extreme minority among the Japanese, just as the Chiang Kai-shek clique is only a tiny minority in China. As for the people, they all oppose the policies of American imperialism.

    American warlords have now manipulated American diplomacy and intervened in the economy to a considerable extent. MacArthur himself is already a very large monopoly capitalist. He has huge shares in important enterprises in Japan and the Philippines.

    These newly emerging American fascists are so "democratic" that one day they will say: "If a free vote were held, ninety percent of the people in the world would favor turning the whole world into a U.S. territory." Then they will use military force to realize this "popular will."

　　昏头昏脑
    美国军阀们被并吞世界的野心弄昏了头，一年多来，越昏越厉害，简直快要疯了！麦克阿瑟对美太平洋舰队总司令邓菲德说：“如果实行自由投票，日本人会有百分之九十赞成变日本为美国之领土。”（合众社）就是一个典型的例子。
    麦克阿瑟这个谈话，暴露了美帝国主义对于日本的野心，它是企图吞并日本。美帝国主义所说的“民主”“自由”等，全是假话。
    麦克阿瑟以为日本人个个都是吉田茂，这种反动派可以天天派了人去麦克阿瑟总部外面叫“阿启散”（即爸爸）；正如他们以为中国人民个个都和蒋介石集团一样，可以把美国做“祖国”。事实恰和麦克阿瑟的看法相反，吉田茂这些反动派在日本人中占极端的少数，正如蒋介石集团在中国只是极少数一样。至于人民，则都是反对美国帝国主义政策的。
    美国军阀现已操纵了美国的外交，并且在相当重要的范围内干预了经济。麦克阿瑟自己已经是很大的独占资本家了。在日本和菲律宾的重要企业，很多都有他的巨大股份。
    这些新出现的美国法西斯，他们是这样的“民主”：将来总有一天会说：“如果实行自由投票，全世界百分之九十的人，都会赞成把全世界变成美国的领土。”然后他们就好用军事力量，来实现这种“民意”。
