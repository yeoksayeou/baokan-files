Everyone Learns Well, Everyone Improves!
    ——Introducing the "Record Well, Learn Well" Movement in Frontline Troops

　　Everyone Learns Well, Everyone Improves!
　　Learn Everything Well, Improve Every Day!
　　Learn More and Better, Improve Forever!
　　Learn Skills Well, Eliminate Chiang's Troops!

Currently, such vivid slogans are spreading in a certain frontline unit, exciting everyone's actions. After the launch of this "Record Well, Learn Well" movement, it further promoted the merit-making movement, expanded the mass character of the merit-making movement, initially solved the problem of promoting small advantages in the merit-making movement, highlighted and promoted the advantages of good comrades, stimulated the overcoming of backwardness, and promoted righteousness. In this movement, cadres took the lead, and soldiers followed. Everywhere, it aroused a surge of "everyone learns well, everything learns well." Wang Daoshun, the platoon deputy of the Second Squad of the Ninth Company, had been sick for four days. When Deputy Company Commander Li Kaiping asked him to see a doctor, he was afraid of being left behind. He said, "My illness is severe, but I still have to follow!" He also took good care of the soldiers, and no one fell behind during the march. As soon as they settled down, he mobilized the comrades in the entire platoon to help the villagers push manure, hoe weeds, and carry water. Li Baocheng, a communication soldier of the First Squad of the Third Company, was only fifteen years old and also had dysentery, but he did not fall behind and even helped others carry things. Vivid examples are too numerous to mention.

How is "good" defined? According to Director Jiang of a certain column, recording the good is a broader mass movement, and the view of "good" should not be too demanding. The leadership must first solve such an ideological problem: "Good" refers to taking a step forward from the existing foundation. In fact, complete goodness is difficult to achieve. Therefore, when good and bad appear in each specific movement, the leadership should vigorously praise the good side, promote the good side, and overcome the bad side. Budding goodness should be cultivated regularly so that it grows into a more complete goodness. The budding of goodness will lead the way, and the general public can be mobilized to discover more complete models in the universal movement. It is essential to avoid forcibly creating "models" all at once. These are not models from the movement, and the masses will not easily accept them. Therefore, it is not necessary to wait until there is this "model" to be considered good. Instead, it is necessary to promote minor advantages at any time according to the situation and level of the mass movement, to promote the general, cultivate models, and improve the level of the entire movement. That is, we must find and record the good at any time in our work and movement, pay attention to commendation, be good at promoting the minor progress of the masses, promote the movement, and give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. This is a key issue.

The content of recording the good includes the small advantages of marching, combat, martial arts training, mass work, etc. Generally, it is based on tasks and higher-level calls. The size of the good is based on the evaluation of the masses and the size of the achievement of tasks and combat achievements. It is divided into squad good, platoon good, and company good, which can all be accumulated in threes. Two company good deeds are equal to one minor merit. It is necessary to record the good if there is good and record the merit if there is merit. The general experience of recording the good is that cadres and branches must grasp it tightly and record it in a timely manner. The Mingzi 37th Company allowed everyone to "find the good" before arriving at the station. During foot washing, everyone "proposed the good" and "reported the good." After evaluation and debate, if it was considered good, the squad and platoon leaders or publicly elected literate soldiers would record them one by one, item by item, in the "Record Good Deeds" booklet. There are two ways to record: one is to use the date as a unit, that is, under the same day, accumulate each person's good deeds according to who did what (such as who helped whom carry a gun and walked several miles). The other is to use people as units, leaving some blank paper behind each person's name and recording the good deeds under his name every day (time, place, what he did). This makes it clearer and easier to see the progress every day. After recording the good, in addition to selecting the outstanding ones to commend before departure or posting them on the bulletin board when stationed, they also "calculate the good" once a week or a stage, combining small good deeds into big good deeds and piecemeal good deeds into whole good deeds to make comparisons between people, groups, and squads, and then announce the good deeds in front of all the soldiers to encourage everyone to strive for victory and learn. This series of "seeing the good," "finding the good," "proposing the good," "reporting the good," "recording the good," "calculating the good," "announcing the good," and "learning the good" forms a relatively complete process of recording good work.

Recording the good is to conduct education and criticism from commendation, to promote the mass righteousness and enthusiasm. In principle: (1) It is necessary to base it on objective circumstances, and not to rigidly stipulate standards and content, forming formalism. (2) According to individual circumstances, enable him to take a step forward from the current foundation. (3) Standards can be raised and content can be added at any time. However, several problems have also occurred in recording the good, which have now been resolved: (1) The issue of cadres recording the good. The Third Company was recorded by the company cadres and the branch, and the scope of recording the good was wider, including organizational leadership and caring for soldiers. In the Seventh Company, officers and soldiers alike raised the good deeds of the officers and the good deeds of the soldiers at the squad meetings, forming commendations from top to bottom. (2) The recorder felt it was troublesome, mainly because the facts were too trivial. The Third Company Branch Committee studied and decided that sweeping five times to clean up was considered a good deed, and carrying three loads of water was considered a good deed, which raised the conditions for good deeds. Those who recorded the deeds found two more people to take turns recording. (3) How to persist in the marching environment? One is to record when the opportunity arises, such as when washing feet, eating, and before departure assembly. The other is to make up the record. Do not force it when too tired, and make up the record when you rest the next day. (4) The idea that small things and occasionally doing one or two good deeds should not be recorded mainly relies on education and persuasion to promote enthusiasm and overcome conservative and backward psychology.

Celebrating merit and celebrating the good is also an important part, which is of great educational significance to everyone. In order to pay attention to this issue, all troops have set up "Good Celebration Days." The celebrations were very grand. The Gongzi unit was bustling with activity. The leader gave the meritorious and good models as orderlies, concentrated on riding horses, and personally led the horses to the company camps to pick them up. They served tea and rice to them when they ate. The military and civilians celebrated the good together. In addition to congratulating with music and tea, the old folks also invited representatives of the masses to participate in the presidium. The soldiers wrote more than 1,300 blackboard newspapers for the celebration of the good, carried them in parades, and gathered them for exhibitions. The celebration activities were divided into two parts: one was to concentrate on the good, calling on everyone to find the good, select the good, record the good, understand the good, and glorify the good. The three-good comrades were happily sent to the regiment to celebrate the good. The other was to persist in the concentrated good deeds after the meeting, recording good comrades, discussing good deeds, studying good deeds, and organizing the learning of good deeds. The combat drama troupe went to various troops to perform operas such as "Lü Dengke" for the celebration of the good. The Combat Newspaper Agency sent more than 200 congratulatory letters. When the Mingzi troops celebrated the good, they mobilized the entire regiment to dance Yangko with weapons to make shirts for the comrades who had made meritorious service. The Binzi unit had a good performance during the celebration of the good: First, it was a mass activity. Before the whole regiment meeting, there were many small group activities, turning all the celebration activities into mass activities from bottom to top. Second, most people were commended. From squads to companies to battalions to regiments, they all went through the masses to find the good, select the good, and even celebrate the good. Many comrades were commended, with as many as sixty or seventy people being commended in each company, not just heroes and models. (Compiled by the Data Room of this newspaper)

　　人人学好，个个进步！
    ——介绍前线部队记好学好运动
    人人学好，个个进步！
    事事学好，天天进步！
    多多学好，永远进步！
    学好本事，消灭蒋军！
    现在我前线某部正传播着这样生动的口号，在激动着每个人的行动。这个记好，学好运动开展后，更推动了立功运动，把立功运动的群众性扩大，初步解决了立功运动发扬点滴优点的问题，使好同志的优点突出起来，发扬起来，刺激克服着落后，发扬着正气。在这个运动中，干部带头，战士跟上。到处激起“人人学好，事事学好”的热潮。二小队九连排副王道顺已经病了四天，副连长李开平让他请医生检查时，他怕把他留在后方，他说：“我的病再严重也得跟着走！”他还很好的照顾战士，行军中，没有一个掉队的。一住下，他就发动全排同志帮助老乡推粪、锄草、担水。一小队三连通讯员李保成，才十五岁，又有痢疾，也不掉队，还帮别人背东西。生动的例子，不胜枚举。
    怎样才算“好”呢？根据某纵政姜主任总结，记好是更广泛的群众运动，对“好”的看法，不能要求过高。这里领导上得先解决这样一个思想问题，“好”是指从现有基础上的提高一步而言，事实上完全的好是难存在的。因此，在每个具体运动中出现好坏，领导上对好的一面，即大力表扬，发扬好的一面，克服坏的一面。萌芽的好，要经常培养，使它成长为比较圆满的好。萌芽好一带头，一般的都能动起来，在普遍的运动中，发现的更完满的典型。切忌一下子就硬弄“典型”，这种不是运动中的典型，群众不易接受。故不能等有了这个“典型”，才算一好，而是要在运动中，依照群众运动的情况、水平，随时发扬微小的优点，用以推动一般，培养典型，以提高整运动的水准；就是我要在工作中，运动中随时找好记好，注意表扬，要善于发扬群众微小的进步，推动运动，发挥群众的积极性、创造性，这是一个关键问题。
    记好的内容，包括着行军、作战、练武、群众工作等的点滴优点。一般是根据任务与上级号召。好的大小，根据群众的评定，根据完成任务与战斗功绩的大小，分为班好、排好、连好，都可以三三累进，两个连好，就是一个小功，做到有好记好，有功记功。记好的办法，一般经验是干部与支部要抓得紧，及时记录。明字三七连则是到达驻地以前，就让大家“找好”，洗脚的时候由大家“提好”“报好”，经评议争论，认为是好的话，就由班排长或公推识字的战士，一个一个的，一条一条的记到记好簿子上。记法有两种：一种是以日期为单元，即在同一日子下把每个人的好，按谁谁怎么（如谁帮谁背枪，走了几里路），积累下来。另一种是以人为单元，每个人名后面留些白纸，每天把好记在他的名下（时间、地点、做了些啥）这样眉目比较清楚，也容易看出每天的进步。记好以后，除选择其突出的在出发前后表扬，或驻军时在门板报上公布外；他们又做到每周或一阶段“算好”一次，综合小好为大好，零碎好为整个好，做出人与人、组与组、班与班的比较，然后在军人全体面前公布好，来激励大家争胜学习。这一系列的“看好”“找好”“提好”“报好”“记好”“算好”“公布好”“学好”就形成记好工作的一个比较完整的过程。
    记好是从表扬中进行教育与批评，要发扬群众性的正气与积极性，原则上：（一）要根据客观情况，不要死规定标准内容，形成形式主义。（二）根据个人情况，使他从现在的基础上提高一步。（三）标准可随时提高，内容可随时增加。但在记好当中，也发生过这样几个问题，现在已经解决了：（一）干部记好问题，三连是由连干和支部记，记好范围广泛一些，包括组织领导和关心士兵等项。七连官兵均在班务会上，官提兵的好，兵也提官的好，形成上下表扬。（二）记的人嫌麻烦，主要是事实太琐碎了。三连支委会研究出打扫五次卫生才算一好，挑三担水才算一好，把好的条件提高了一些，记的人多找两个，轮流着记。（三）行军环境中怎样坚持？一个是抓住时机就记，譬如洗脚时、吃饭时、出发集合前。再一个是补记，太疲累了不勉强，第二天休息过来时再补上。（四）认为小事和偶然做一两件好事不让人记的思想，主要依靠教育说服，发扬积极性，克服保守的，落后的心理。
    庆功庆好问题，也是一个重要的环节，对大家教育意义很大。为了重视这个问题，各部队都订出“庆好日”。庆好的时候，非常隆重。功字部闹得热火潮天；首长给功臣好的模范当勤务员，集中乘马，亲自牵马到连营里接他们，他们吃饭时给他们端茶端饭，军民同庆好，老百姓除致乐献茶果祝贺外，还请群众代表参加主席团。战士写了一千三百多篇门板报稿给庆好，抬着游行，集中展览。庆好活动分为两部，一是集中好，叫大家找好、选好、记好、认识好、荣耀好的，三好同志逐级欢送到团庆贺好。一是大会后，把集中的好坚持下去，记好同志，回去谈好，研究好，组织学好。战斗剧社为了庆好，去各部队演出“吕登科”等歌剧，战斗报社发出二百多封贺好信。明字部队贺好时，发动全团武装扭秧歌，替立功得好的同志做衬衣。斌字部举行庆好时，有很好表现：第一是群众性活动。在全团大会以前，小集团活动很多，把一切庆好活动，造成自下而上的群众活动。第二是表扬多数，从班排到营团，都经过群众找好选好以至庆好，被表扬的同志很多，每连被表扬的有六、七十人之多。不是光表扬英雄模范。（本报资料室整理）
