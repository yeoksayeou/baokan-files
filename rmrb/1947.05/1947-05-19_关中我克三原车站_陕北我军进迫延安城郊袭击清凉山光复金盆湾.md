　　Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, Urgent Telegram, 16th: Sanyuan Station, only seventy miles south of Xi'an (three miles from Sanyuan County), was completely captured by a unit of the Northwest People's Liberation Army on the night of the 13th and thoroughly destroyed. This battle is only ten days away from the liberation of Yao County. Bridges near Yao County Northwest and Yanliang Bridge were also completely blown up. The Longhai Railway's Xian (Yang) to Tong (Guan) branch line, the main artery of the Jiang-Hu army invading northern Shaanxi, has been cut into several sections again. Xiaoqiu Town, a stronghold of the Jiang-Hu army forty miles south of Liulin Town on the right side of the railway, was also captured by the People's Liberation Army on the 13th. The entire Gao Yanlong squadron of the Jiang's "Self-Defense Force" and the puppet township office were annihilated. The Hu army in the nearby strongholds of Fangli and Tongrun fled upon hearing the news, and the two towns were liberated again.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi Front, 17th: Following the recovery of Panlong and Qinghuabian, the Northwest People's Liberation Army took advantage of the victory to advance towards Yan'an. The vanguard forces joined the local guerrillas as early as the 9th on the outskirts of the city. On the night of the 10th, they attacked Yizhuangping, twenty miles northeast of the city. A company of the 5th Battalion of the "National Defense Ministry's Youth Army" stationed there fled back into the city upon hearing the news. Another unit of the People's Liberation Army attacked Qingliang Mountain in the east corner of the city. The defending enemy in the city was terrified and dug fortifications and buried landmines on the mountains in the four suburbs for days. All gates except the south gate have been blocked, and traffic is prohibited inside and outside the city even during the day. The military might of the People's Liberation Army is greatly enhanced. This reporter patrolled the vicinity of Yan'an city and heard singing echoing in the valleys and rivers everywhere, interspersed with Yangko drums. Large slogans of "Preparing for a Major Counter-Offensive" could be seen along the way. After the People's Liberation Army arrived, the people in the suburbs sent food and water and vied to tell their grievances, as if seeing relatives. Labor hero Yang Buhao personally sent four chickens, representing the people of Yan'an, to pay tribute to the People's Liberation Army.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 17th: On the 11th, a unit of the Northwest People's Liberation Army once again recovered Jinpen Bay, a famous area seventy miles southeast of Yan'an, and annihilated the defending enemy Jiang's "Shaanxi People's Self-Defense Second General Team". More than 200 people, including Deputy General Captain Li Shengxia, were captured, more than 100 were killed or wounded, and three machine guns, more than 160 long and short guns, more than 30,000 rounds of ammunition, and more than ten war horses were seized.

　　关中我克三原车站
    陕北我军进迫延安城郊袭击清凉山光复金盆湾
    【新华社西北十六日急电】南距西安仅七十里之三原车站（距三原县城三里），十三日夜已被西北人民解放军某部一举攻克，并将其彻底破坏。此役与解放耀县之役相距仅十日。耀县西北及颜良桥附近桥梁同时悉数被炸毁，蒋胡军侵犯陕北大动脉之陇海路咸（阳）同（官）支线又被切成数段。该路右侧柳林镇南四十里之蒋胡军据点小邱镇，十三日亦被解放军攻克，蒋记“自卫队”高彦龙中队及伪乡公所全部被歼；附近方里、通润两据点胡军闻风逃窜，该两镇遂再度解放。
    【新华社陕北前线十七日电】继收复蟠龙、青化砭之后，西北人民解放军乘胜向延安推进，先头部队九日即进迫城郊与当地游击队会合。十日晚并袭入城东北二十里之沂庄坪，据守该处之“国防部青年军”五大队一个中队闻风窜回城内。解放军另一部袭击城东角之清凉山，城内守敌惊恐万状，连日在四郊各山头挖工事，埋地雷，除南门外各门都已封堵，即白昼城内外也禁绝通行；解放军军威大震。记者巡行延市近郊，处处听见歌声荡漾山谷大川，间杂秧歌锣鼓声，沿途可见“准备大反攻”之大字标语。近郊人民于解放军到达后，送饭、送水，争相诉苦，如见亲人。劳动英雄杨步浩亲自送来鸡四只，代表延安人民向解放军致敬。
    【新华社西北十七日电】十一日西北人民解放军某部再度光复延安东南七十里之著名地区金盆湾，尽歼守敌蒋记“陕西人民自卫第二总队”，俘副总队长李生侠以下二百余人，毙伤其百余人，缴获机枪三挺，长短枪一百六十余枝，子弹三万余发，战马十余匹。
