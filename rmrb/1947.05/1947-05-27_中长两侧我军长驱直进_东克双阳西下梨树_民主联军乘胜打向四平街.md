Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, Urgent Telegram, 24th: A unit of the Northeast Democratic Allied Forces recaptured Shuangyang County, 90 li southeast of Changchun, yesterday afternoon (the 23rd). The defending enemy, consisting of the security regiment and police brigade, fled in disarray.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, Urgent Telegram, 24th: A unit of the Northeast Democratic Allied Forces recaptured Lishu County, 30 li northwest of Siping, on the morning of the 23rd, and directly attacked Siping. The defeated enemy, who fled from Yushutai to Lishu City on the night of the 22nd, had barely caught their breath when they fled in panic towards Siping. A unit of the Democratic Allied Forces pursued them fiercely for more than 10 li, and the majority of the fleeing enemy, including the 2nd Security Regiment of Liaobei Province, were annihilated. Another unit annihilated the remaining troops of the enemy's 1st Security Regiment in Guojiadian, 60 li northeast of Siping. The Democratic Allied Forces are now advancing towards Siping in triumph.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 24th: After the recapture of Tonghua, the Liaodong Liberated Area has become a vast consolidated base area. The city is located on the Mei (Hekou) Ji (An) line and is an important industrial city in the Changbai Mountains, known for its coal and iron production. During the puppet Manchukuo period, Tonghua was the seat of the provincial government. In October of last year, Chiang's troops violated the agreement and occupied the area, using it as a base of operations for invading the Liaoning Liberated Area. This spring, they used it as a launching point for four attacks on Linjiang, suffering repeated defeats and the annihilation of two divisions. Subsequently, the Democratic Allied Forces successively recovered Jinchuan, Liuhe, Huinan, Huanren, Ji'an and other cities, leaving only the isolated city of Tonghua as a wedge into the Liberated Area. With the successive victories on all fronts of the Democratic Allied Forces' summer offensive, Chiang's troops, knowing that defeat was inevitable, fled in haste on the 23rd. The Democratic Allied Forces are now pursuing and annihilating them. (Attached picture)

　　中长两侧我军长驱直进
  　东克双阳西下梨树
  　民主联军乘胜打向四平街
    【新华社东北前线二十四日急电】东北民主联军一部，于昨（二十三日）下午收复长春东南九十里之双阳县城，守敌保安团及警察大队，狼狈逃窜。
    【新华社东北前线二十四日急电】东北民主联军一部，于二十三日晨收复四平西北三十余里之梨树县城，直捣四平城下。二十二日夜，由榆树台逃往梨树城之败敌，喘息未定，即慌乱向四平方向逃窜，民主联军一部猛追十余里，逃敌辽北省保安第二团等大部就歼。另部在四平东北六十里之郭家店，将敌保安一团残部全部歼灭。现民主联军正乘胜向四平挺进。
    【新华社东北前线二十四日电】通化收复后，辽东解放区已连成一片广大根据地。该城位于梅（河口）辑（安）线上，系长白山区之一重要工业城市，为煤铁之著名产地。伪满时，通化省省府即设于此。去年十月，蒋军违约侵占该地，作为进犯辽宁解放区之兵站基地；今春以此作进攻出发地四犯临江，被歼两师连遭败溃后，民主联军即相继收复金川、柳河、辉南、桓仁、辑安等城，仅余此一楔入解放区之通化孤城。此次民主联军夏季攻势各线连捷，蒋军自知败局已成，乃于二十三日仓惶逃窜，现民主联军正追歼中。（附图片）
