Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, May 27th: TASS, Tirana: Enver Hoxha, Chairman of the Government of the People's Republic of Albania, has sent a letter to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, lodging a strong protest against the intrusion of Greek aircraft into Albanian territory and the machine-gunning of Albanian villages. The letter stated: On May 21, 1947, three Greek aircraft intruded 15 kilometers into Albanian territory, circled over the territory of Kers for forty minutes, and machine-gunned peaceful villages, resulting in the death and injury of ten people, including the elderly, women, and children. The act of aggression on May 21st has aroused strong indignation among all the people of Albania. I, on behalf of the people and government of the People's Republic of Albania, strongly protest to the United Nations against this crime of the Greek monarchist fascist government, and request that our protest be submitted to the Security Council as soon as possible, in order to completely stop Greece's infringement upon Albania's sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity, and the lives of its citizens.
