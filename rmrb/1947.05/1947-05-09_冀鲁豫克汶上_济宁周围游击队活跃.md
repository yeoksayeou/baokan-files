　　Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Lu Yu, 7th: (Delayed) Local armed forces of the Seventh Sub-district of Jilu Yu, combined with militia, recovered the county town of Wenshang on the 29th of last month, capturing over 70 enemy soldiers.
    This newspaper, Jilu Yu, 6th: The First Armed Work Team of Jining, in late February, raided the Jining city gate five times, and carried out land reform in groups within 20 li around Jining City, achieving great results: (1) Protecting the interests of the masses. On the second day after the enemy occupied Jiaxiang, the puppet county district chief of Jining forced each village to establish a Baojia system and organize self-defense corps. However, that night, our armed work team entered many villages, held mass meetings, and suppressed bad elements. The masses immediately had a reliance, and democratic order was restored. (2) Organizing activities flexibly and achieving brilliant results: On the ×× highway, two team members destroyed an enemy car, obtaining various car parts and more than 20 bullets. Three team members seized an American-style submachine gun, more than 800 jin of electric wire, and ambushed a passing regiment of the enemy's 75th Division, capturing 17 Chiang soldiers and secret agents on the highway, wounding one, with no losses on our side. (3) Launching a propaganda offensive. In the areas under their responsibility, even as far as Bali Temple and Wuliying near Jining, village meetings were held openly or secretly to publicize the situation and the policy of severe oppression against landlords and puppet regime personnel. Slogans were written everywhere. After the enemy looted, village meetings were immediately convened to comfort the masses, and the deer barricades cut down by the enemy were distributed, anti-Chiang oaths were taken, and bad Bao chiefs were suppressed. (4) Inspecting American goods, conducting tax collection, and stabilizing currency value. American goods were frequently inspected on the highway, and our industrial and commercial policies were implemented.
    This newspaper, Jilu Yu, 5th: The Kao County Wang Hongsheng Guerrilla Team relies on tunnels to cleverly attack the enemy. When the enemy conducted a sweep in the central area of our Kao County, they advanced from north and south in three routes. At Dazhaiji, they were intercepted by the Wang Hongsheng guerrilla team of our Kao County backbone battalion. After killing two enemies, the guerrilla team retreated to ×× village and joined the guerrilla group of Ma Zhenqing. Relying on the village's tunnels, they continued to fight the enemy. When the enemy advanced to within a dozen steps of our guerrilla team's hiding place, the guerrilla members suddenly opened fire, and a Chiang army company commander and his entourage fell to the ground. The remaining enemy fled in disarray. Subsequently, the enemy transferred a mortar from Wangdazhuang and shelled the courtyard defended by our guerrilla team for two hours. Although the enemy fired more than 200 shells, our guerrilla team relied on the tunnels to persist and suffered no losses. The enemy launched a fierce attack on the courtyard, but our troops entered the tunnels. When the enemy entered the courtyard, it was empty. They searched for a long time before discovering the entrance to the tunnel, but none dared to go down. This guerrilla team emerged from the tunnels in the wilderness at dusk. As they searched forward, they discovered four enemy grain-grabbing carts and rushed forward, ordering the enemy to surrender their guns. Our sniper killed an enemy squad leader with one shot and shot down another with another shot. The remaining enemy abandoned their carts and fled in panic. Subsequently, the enemy troops were also in disarray, and our guerrilla team took away the four guns left by the enemy and quickly withdrew from the battle.
