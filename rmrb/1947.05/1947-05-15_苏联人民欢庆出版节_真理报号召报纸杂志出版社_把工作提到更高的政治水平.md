　　Soviet People Celebrate Publishing Festival
    Truth Calls on Newspapers and Magazine Publishers
    to Raise Work to a Higher Political Level
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th] Comprehensive Report: The Soviet people warmly celebrated the Publishing Festival and summarized the unprecedented great achievements of Soviet publishing work. May 5th is the Soviet Publishing Festival. Thirty-five years ago, the Truth Newspaper, founded by Lenin and Stalin, was published on this day. Because the Soviet people play the most active role in news and publishing work, this festival is widely celebrated by the Soviet Republics. On the eve of the festival, wall newspaper editors, factory newspaper editors, worker correspondents, and many readers in various districts of Moscow held meetings to commemorate the event. Representatives of the Moscow publishing industry and worker correspondents held a meeting in the Trade Union Hall on the 5th to commemorate the event. The publishing industry, as usual, reviewed its achievements and planned its future work. According to statistics, a total of 7,000 newspapers are now published in the Soviet Union, with a circulation of 30 million copies. Since the Soviet Revolution, 85,000 kinds of books have been published, with a total of 1.1 billion copies printed. In 1946 alone, 23,000 kinds of books were published, with a total of 500 million copies printed. The average circulation of each book is 20,000 copies, which is more than six times the circulation of each book in the Tsarist Russia era of 1913. The works of famous writers are published in millions of copies. For example, Gorky's works have been translated into 66 languages and distributed 43 million copies. "Quiet Flows the Don," the most popular Soviet novel written by Sholokhov, has been printed in 5 million copies. Soviet books, magazines, and newspapers are regularly printed in 115 languages, including the dialects of those ethnic groups that had no written language before the revolution. The works of Lenin and Stalin have been published in the languages of all Soviet nationalities. Lenin's works have been printed in 154.5 million copies, and Stalin's works have been printed in 470.5 million copies. Although the number of books printed is so large, it still cannot meet the demand.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th] Moscow Dispatch: The Truth published an editorial on the 5th to commemorate the Soviet Publishing Festival, stating: Because the broad masses directly and creatively participate in publishing work to engage in practical socialist construction, the Soviet publishing industry is powerful. We regard the Publishing Festival as a victory for Soviet socialist democracy, which, for the first time in history, has shown the world an example of establishing truly free and mass-oriented newspapers. No matter what the reactionary pseudo-democrats in every corner shout about their "freedom of the press," freedom of the press is unimaginable where capitalism is in power. The editorial continued: Today, facing the major tasks of the post-war Stalin Five-Year Plan, the people demand that newspapers, magazines, book publishers, journalists, and writers raise their work to a new and higher political level. The editorial pointed out: Soviet newspapers have played an important role in promoting Stalin's foreign policy and opposing the international reactionaries' conspiracy to plan a new war. Our newspapers must always firmly strive for the consolidation of peace and friendship among all countries and persistently and firmly defend the interests of freedom and democracy.

　　苏联人民欢庆出版节
    真理报号召报纸杂志出版社   
    把工作提到更高的政治水平
    【新华社陕北十日电】综合报导：苏联人民热烈的庆祝了出版节，并总结了苏联出版工作的空前伟大成就。五月五日是苏联的出版节，三十五年前由列宁、斯大林创办的真理报就是在这一天出版的。因为苏联人民在新闻和出版工作中起着最积极的作用，这一节日被苏维埃共和国广泛的庆祝着。在节日前夜，莫斯科各地区的墙报编辑、工厂报纸编辑、工人通讯员和许多读者都分别开会纪念。莫斯科出版界与工人通讯员的代表们于五日在职工会大厅开会纪念。出版界照例检讨它的成就，并计划今后的工作。据统计：现在苏联全国共出版七千种报纸，发行三千万份。苏维埃革命以来，已出版八万五千种书，共印了一百一十万万份，仅一九四六年一年内就出了二万三千种书，共印了五十万万份，平均每种书的发行额是两万份，比一九一三年帝俄时代每种书的发行额超过六倍。名作家的作品都是数百万份的出版着。例如高尔基的作品就译成六十六种文字，发行了四千三百万份。萧洛霍夫写的苏联最流行的小说：《静静的顿河》，已印出了五百万部。苏联的书籍杂志和报纸经常用一百一十五种文字印行，其中包括革命前还没有文字的那些民族的方言。列宁、斯大林的著作已经用苏联各民族的文字出版。列宁的著作已印行了一万五千四百五十万份，斯大林的著作已印行了四万七千零五十万份。虽印出书籍数目如此巨大，但仍供不应求。
    【新华社陕北十日电】莫斯科讯：真理报于五日发表社论，纪念苏联出版节，略称：因为广大群众直接有创造性地参加出版工作以从事于实际的社会主义建设，苏联出版界是强有力的。我们把出版节作为苏维埃社会主义民主的胜利，它在历史上第一次向全世界显示出建立真正自由和大众化的报纸的范例。不论各个角落里的反动的假民主分子对他们的“新闻自由”叫嚣些什么，新闻自由在资本主义当权的地方是不可想像的。社论继称：今天面临战后斯大林五年计划的重大任务，人民要求报纸、杂志和书籍的出版社及新闻记者同著作家们提高他们的工作到新的更高的政治水平。社论指出：苏联报纸在宣扬斯大林外交政策及反对国际反动派阴谋计划新战争上面起了重要作用，我们的报纸一定永远坚决的为各国的巩固和平和友谊而奋斗，并持久而坚定的保卫自由与民主的利益。
