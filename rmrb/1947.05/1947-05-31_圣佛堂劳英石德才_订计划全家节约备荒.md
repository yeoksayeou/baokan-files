[This report from our Jinnan office, dated the 29th] Labor Hero Shi Decai of Shengfotang, Weixian County, based on the challenge conditions of the entire group, first formulated his own production, conservation, drought prevention, and famine preparedness plan: A. Agricultural plan: (1) Complete the emergency planting of all land before the 11th. (2) Plant seven fen of green vegetables and bean pods along the edges of the fields. (3) Work with Geng Lanyu to dig a well, transforming twenty mu of dry land into irrigated land, and organize all family members with semi-labor power to participate in agricultural production, hoeing common crops such as millet and sesame three times each. B. In terms of sideline occupations, his wife plans to weave six zhang of purple floral cloth in the summer, raise one pig, and ten chickens, and invest 12,000 yuan in the district cooperative. In terms of conservation, the existing grain is enough to last until the wheat harvest. The construction of a house will be halted, saving more than 20,000 yuan in labor costs and more than 50,000 yuan in raw materials. In terms of diet, rice "窝窝" (a kind of corn bread) will be replaced with millet "窝窝", smoking and drinking will be completely stopped, matches will not be purchased, fire strikers will be used instead, and vegetables, steamed buns, and 饸饹 (héluo, a type of noodle) will not be purchased.

[This report from our Jinnan office, dated the 29th] Since Shengfotang launched a challenge during the famine recollection meeting on the evenings of the 11th and 12th, stipulating that emergency planting be completed in five days, labor hero Shi Decai first overcame the rain-waiting mentality of some of the masses on the morning of the 13th with the practical action of completing the planting of his own land. He led the entire village to urgently sow seeds, and by the evening of the 15th, statistics showed that only in five days, Shi Decai's group, Guo Pengyu's group, and the eighth group had completed the emergency planting ahead of schedule, and the other five groups had completed it on schedule. The land planted in place of those carrying stretchers was also fully planted. In order to produce more grain and apply more fertilizer, more than 120 old stoves were dismantled in the village during the emergency planting to make more than 500 carts of fertilizer, and more than 200 carts of old walls were dismantled to make fertilizer. Currently, the small vegetables are about to ripen, and the sorghum seedlings are growing tall. The plan is to quickly harvest the ripe small vegetables and then mobilize the mutual aid groups to launch a sorghum hoeing campaign.

[This report from our Jinnan office, dated the 29th] Due to the drought and lack of rain, various places are learning from the lessons of the great famine in 1943 and are actively promoting frugality and seeking substitute foods. In Guojiazhuang, Longping Second District, all one hundred households in the village currently have forty households eating red sorghum, sunflower seeds, and bran, and are actively collecting wild vegetables and other substitute foods. They go to the wild to collect wild vegetables at 6:00 PM every day, dry them in the sun, and store them for long-term use. Xie Jinhang of Xielu Village, Qinghe Second District, seeing the drought and lack of rain, is not only mixing bran and vegetables to eat less grain, but also actively making mud bricks to sell for money.

　　圣佛堂劳英石德才
  　订计划全家节约备荒
    【本报冀南二十九日电】威县圣佛堂劳英石德才根据全组挑战条件，首先订出自己的生产节约防旱备荒计划：甲、农业计划：（１）十一日前将地全部抢种完毕。（２）地边再种七分青菜和豆荚。（３）和耿兰玉伙打一眼井，变二十亩旱地为水地，组织全家半劳力参加农业生产，一般谷子、芝麻等杂粮各锄三遍。乙、副业上，他媳妇计划夏季织六丈紫花布，养猪一口，鸡十只，入区合作社一万二千元的股。在节约方面，现有的粮食，可吃到麦收，停止盖房，可节省工钱两万多元，原料五万多元，吃饭将米窝窝改为谷子窝窝，纸烟、酒全部戒掉，不买洋火，改用火链，不买菜、馒头、＠子。
    【本报冀南廿九日电】圣佛堂自十一、十二日晚在灾荒回忆大会中挑战，规定五天完成抢种后，劳动英雄石德才首先于十三日上午以全部种完自己地的实际行动，克服部分群众的等雨思想，领导全村紧张下种，至十五日晚统计，仅五天中，已有石德才组、郭朋玉组及第八组提前完成抢种，其他五个组均按期完成，出担架的代种地亦全种上。为了多打粮食多上粪，在抢种中全村拆老灶一百二十多座，做成肥料五百多车，拆老墙做肥料二百多车。目前小菜将熟，高粱苗长大，计划迅速把熟了的小菜割完，即动员各互助组展开锄高粱运动。
    【本报冀南二十九日电】天旱不雨，各地接受三十二年大灾荒教训，纷纷提倡省吃俭用，觅寻代食品。隆平二区国家庄，全村百户人家，现已有四十户吃红粮、花籽、糠秕，并积极搜集野菜等代食品。每天下午六时去野外采野菜，晒干保藏起来，作长期打算。清河二区谢芦村谢金杭，见到天旱不雨，一面掺糠菜少吃粮，一面积极制坯卖钱。
