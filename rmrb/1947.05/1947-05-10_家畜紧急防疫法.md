　　Emergency Livestock Disease Prevention Law
　　Peking University College of Agriculture Research Laboratory
　　Various animal epidemics are again prevalent in various regions. We are now writing down the emergency prevention methods below, hoping that local governments will lead the masses to resolutely and diligently implement them.
　　1. Upon discovering a sick animal, immediately isolate the healthy livestock far away to avoid infection, and do not allow them to graze outside.
　　2. The person feeding the sick livestock must not feed the healthy livestock; the feeding troughs and utensils used for the sick livestock must not be taken to the healthy livestock.
　　3. A small pool should be dug at the entrance of the livestock shed (the same width as the entrance, two to three inches deep), filled with lime powder. People entering and exiting the livestock shed must step into the lime pool for foot disinfection.
　　4. Use fresh, clean, dry hay and feed, and boil it first for disinfection and easy digestion.
　　5. When pigs first get sick, crush half a bowl of almonds or a dozen cloves of garlic, mix with flour to form many small balls (about the size of soft dates), and place them in the pig feed. Unaffected pigs can also eat them for prevention.
　　6. Sick livestock are not allowed to be bought, sold, or grazed. It is best to stop all livestock trading in epidemic areas.
　　7. Dead livestock must be buried deep (five feet or more) in secluded places far from roads. Slaughtering and selling are strictly prohibited. Manure and urine left on the road must be scraped away and disinfected with lime.
　　8. The inside of the sick livestock's shed and utensils must be washed and disinfected with lime water (three pounds of lime per hundred pounds of water). Its bedding and feces must be burned or buried deep, and some lime powder should be sprinkled in the pen.

　　家畜紧急防疫法
    北大农学院研究室
    各种兽疫，又在各地流行了。现在把紧急防疫方法，写在下面，希望各地政府，领导群众，坚决努力实行。
    １、发现一畜有病，马上把好的家畜远远隔离，免受传染，并不可放牧于外。
    ２、喂病畜的人，一定不能再去喂好畜；病畜用过的食槽和用具，都不能带到好畜那边去用。
    ３、畜舍门口，都要挖一小池，（宽和门口一样、深二三寸）内放石灰粉，进出畜舍的人，都要踏入灰池，以行脚下消毒。
    ４、要用新鲜清洁的干草和饲料喂养，并先煮过，既行消毒，又好消化。
    ５、在猪初得病时，用小半碗杏仁或大蒜十几瓣，捣碎，用面和成许多小团，（如软枣大小），放在猪食内，没病的猪，吃了也可预防。
    ６、病畜不准买卖及放牧，在有疫病的地区最好停止一切牲口的买卖。
    ７、病死的家畜，须深埋（五尺以下）在距道路很远的僻静地方，绝对禁止屠杀及贩卖，遗在路上的粪尿，须刮去、并撒布石灰消毒。
    ８、病畜的舍内和用具，须用石灰水（一百斤水、三斤石灰）洗涤消毒，它的卧草及粪便，必须烧掉或深埋，圈内再撒些石灰粉。
