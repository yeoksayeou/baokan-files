　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th: TASS, Tokyo: The Allied Council for Japan held a meeting on May 14 to discuss the issue of "prices and wages." The Soviet representative, General Derevyanko, stated that the issue of stabilizing prices and wages cannot be viewed in isolation from the general economic state of Japan today and the causes of economic difficulties. The characteristics of Japan's economic situation today are low levels of industrial production, a lack of food, raw materials, and manufactured goods, widespread speculation, rising prices, and inflation. This constantly reduces real wages and makes the situation of workers and employees increasingly worse. General Derevyanko pointed out that large monopoly companies still retain their economic power and dominate industry and banking, and are trying their best to directly influence the policies of the Japanese government for their own interests. The continuous recommendations made by the Allied Council for Japan on economic issues have been ignored. As for land reform, it is still being carried out in a completely unsatisfactory manner; no measures have been taken to curb inflation; price controls and controls on the distribution of raw materials and finished products have not been established; black markets and speculators have not been restrained in the slightest. At the same time, effective measures have not been taken to limit unproductive expenditures in the budget. The American representative, Acheson, believed that if all the issues mentioned by Derevyanko were to be discussed, the meeting would be prolonged for too long and would deviate too far from the issues on the agenda. The meeting ended without any result.

　　在麦克阿瑟纵容下
    日本大的垄断公司仍可影响政府政策
    【新华社陕北二十日电】据塔斯社东京讯：盟国对日委员会五月十四日开会讨论“物价和工资”问题，苏代表德勒维杨科将军发言，认为安定物价和工资的问题，不能同今天日本一般的经济状态和经济难关的原因孤立起来看。今天日本经济情势的特点是工业生产水平的低下，粮食、原料和制造品的缺乏，广布的投机，日益高昂的物价及通货膨胀。这样就经常降低实际工资而使工人和雇员之景况日益恶化。德勒维杨科将军指出：大的垄断公司仍然保有他们的经济力量并支配着工业和银行业，而且为了他们自己的利益，竭力直接影响日本政府的政策。盟国对日委员会关于经济问题所提出之连续建议，均被置若罔闻。至于土地改革，仍然进行得完全不能令人满意；没有采取任何措施抑制通货膨胀，物价管制以及分配原料和成品的管制，均未成立；在黑市及投机者，丝毫未予抑制。同时，也未能采取有效的办法，来限制预算中不生产的支出。美代表艾其森对于德勒维杨科所提到的问题，竟认为如果都要讨论，会议将延得太长，并且将离议程中的问题太远，该日会议遂无结果。
