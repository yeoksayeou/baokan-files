　　District Chief Personally Repairs Canal
    Shahe Fourth District Draws Water into Fields
    [Report from this newspaper] When Wang, the district chief of Shahe Fourth District, passed by the Baicuo River and saw that the water was abundant, he thought that if a canal were built, it could irrigate a lot of land. When he returned to the village and told the masses, some didn't believe it. On the evening of the 6th, he, along with cooperative chairman Hu Lai's, and honorary soldier Lao Ni's comrades went to the river to investigate. They found that building a canal from east to west could irrigate more than one *qing* of land. Immediately, they calculated the costs: using a waterwheel on the Baicuo River to irrigate one *mu* of land requires a full labor force plus a half labor force, or two workdays; after the canal is built, irrigating one *mu* of land will require at most half a workday, totaling six workdays to irrigate twelve *mu* of land, saving eighteen workdays. Irrigating three times would save a total of fifty-four workdays. The canal construction plan could be completed in ten workdays. If irrigating millet and vegetables, which require seven waterings, even more labor would be saved, not including the use of ropes and other materials. The three of them returned to the village and presented this calculation to the masses in a meeting. The masses said, "It sounds good, but we're afraid it can't be done." The next day, District Chief Wang and the cooperative chairman, along with seven others, went to repair the canal for a day. Because it wasn't completed, the district chief went to another village for a meeting. The cooperative chairman and others continued to repair it for half a day, but it still wasn't finished, and their morale dropped. When the district chief returned from the meeting, the second day before dawn, he and the cooperative chairman, along with seven others, went to repair the canal again for a day. That day, they irrigated three *mu* of land. The twelve *mu* of land by the river could be irrigated in two days (using a total of eighteen workdays). Further upstream, eighty *mu* of land could be irrigated. Now that the masses see that the land can be irrigated, their morale is high. They proposed: "We must not only build this canal, but also build a canal to draw water from the Zhangcun Kiln to irrigate the land, so that not a single drop is wasted." In the past, no one used the water from the Zhangcun Kiln to irrigate the land, letting it flow freely. In the future, we must make full use of it.

　　区长亲自修渠
    沙河四区引水入田
    【本报讯】沙河四区王区长路过白错河时，见水很大，要是修水渠能浇很多地，回村向群众说，有的不相信。六日晚，他和合作社长胡来的、荣誉军人老尼的同志去河边察看，从东往西修成渠能浇一顷多地，当下算了算帐：白错一天井浇一亩地，得一个整劳力配一个半劳力或得两个工；修渠后一亩地最多用半个工，合计十二亩地六个工就能浇一水，就省十八个工。浇三水共能省五十四个工。修渠计划十个工就能完成，要浇谷子、菜都得七水，省工更多，其他用绳等尚不计算在内。三人回村在大会上把这个帐给群众一算，群众说：“好到好，就怕不能办。”第二天王区长就和社长等七人去修了一天，没修成区长就去别村开会，社长等又去修了半天没修成，情绪低落下来。区长开会回来，第二天天不明就和社长等七人又去修了一天，当天就浇了三亩地，河边十二亩地两天就可浇完（共用工十八个），再往上修能浇八十亩地。现在群众见能浇地，情绪高了，提出：咱们不但要把这渠修成，还要把章村窑上的水修成渠浇地，不让他浪费一点，因章村窑水过去没人浇地，让他自流，今后要全部利用起来。
