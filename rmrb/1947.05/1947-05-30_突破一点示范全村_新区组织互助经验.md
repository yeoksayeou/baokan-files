　　Wumen Village (new district) began production work this year with cadres putting forward the slogan that everyone should engage in mutual aid, and they were forced to organize. For example, the three natural villages of Wumen, Nanpan, and Shanxidi formed 35 groups, totaling 162 people. However, the ideological problems of the masses were not resolved, and the organization was just a formality. Except for a few labor exchanges during the rush to plow the land, it did not move at all, and even the cadres did not participate in the mutual aid groups.

　　What ideological problems did the masses have? They can be roughly divided into the following types: First, going to the fields is not as profitable as carrying loads; second, participating in mutual aid is not free or fair; third, people fear wealth like pigs fear fat, just not starving to death is enough; fourth, although there will be no more struggle in the future, we have to see the situation regarding burdens. The village cadres themselves did not participate in mutual aid, and their reason was that they had too much work, but in reality, they were also hindered by these thoughts. The root cause of these ideas comes from two aspects: one is that they do not understand the production policy and have no personal experience of organizing to replace machines, and they are still doubtful about organizing to become rich; the other is that the influence of certain "equalization" policies during the land reform made them afraid to let go of production. Therefore, they adopted a negative attitude towards production, only caring about not going hungry in the short term, and carrying loads outside could also avoid corvee labor.

　　However, there was another situation, namely that among all the mutual aid groups in Wumen, two or three groups persisted and did a very good job. In this process, the leadership closely grasped and helped them, thus promoting the work a step further and playing a demonstrative role for the whole village. For example, the Wumen Wang Naohai mutual aid group of five people, because they were the best laborers in the past, and three households were newly turned-over basic masses with high production enthusiasm, coupled with serious work recording and exchange (although they had not yet adopted a scientific and convenient work point system, they generally achieved fairness and rationality), the leadership praised their enthusiasm and good methods; the Nanpan Laisheng group of three people exchanged labor (they avoided saying mutual aid, believing that exchanging labor was free, while mutual aid was not), originally one person could only deliver manure three times in the morning, but three people did four times in one morning; when planting millet, three people pulled the seed drill, planting eighteen mu a day, and finished planting their own millet in three days. The leadership also publicized the labor-saving situation of mutual aid, while pointing out that this was mutual aid, and relieved the masses of their burden of fearing mutual aid.

　　At the same time, the leadership, based on the needs of the work at that time and the mood of the masses, put forward the slogan of "three no delays", guaranteeing that participating in the war would not delay production, and that carrying loads and transportation would be carried out in the gaps. After discussion by the masses, it was decided to mobilize all full and semi-labor women and children in the village to participate in production, sort out corvee labor, and accurately calculate the labor of the preferential treatment for resistance (to the US), thus greatly exerting the power of the organization.

　　For example, Shanxi studied the issue of corvee labor and determined the method: clear the corvee labor accounts before March, more earning and less supplementing; clear the accounts of those on long-term war service for one month, and those at home, in addition to repaying labor by planting land for the families of those on duty, would first take out some rice to give to those on duty as travel expenses, so that those participating in the war would not feel difficulty and would be happy to go out. After returning, they had to report to the village, the good ones would be praised, and the bad ones would be criticized.

　　The women and children in Nanpan were well organized. Wang Lanying's entire group hoed forty-three mu of wheat out of fifty-two mu in four days; the children's Du Fa group also hoed more than thirty mu in six days. In this way, the full male labor force was freed up to carry coal and transport it, and everyone was also very energetic. As Xiao Budan said: "Before, when I went to the fields with my grandfather, I would hoe a little and look around, and I couldn't finish hoeing with torment; when I went to the fields with Du Fa and the others, I finished hoeing in no time."

　　In this movement, the masses gradually overcame their ideological problems, and the situation of mutual aid has improved. Now cadres not only participate in mutual aid, but also lead everyone to work; the masses not only participate in mutual aid with their full labor force, but even the old women also participate in mutual aid. Now the whole administrative village wants to learn from them. (Liang Zhi, Hong Ji, Zhang Qing)

　　Dongzhuang in the Eighth District has a total of more than 130 households, 1,700 mu of land, and 18 large cattle and donkeys. After the rain, the masses were worried that the village only had a few plows and could not plant all the land. The emancipated peasant Li Zhang, under the understanding of "doing a good job in one group and promoting the whole village," first combined five households without livestock to pull the plow for three days, plowing and planting 15 mu of stubble land, and then plowing sorghum land. The 58-year-old Li Ruilan and the 17-year-old Li Fang had swollen arms. Li Ruilan didn't want to do it anymore, but Li Zhang patiently explained, "People support the land, and the land supports the people. If we don't plant seedlings, what can we expect?" Later, the plowing was changed to a moldboard plow, which was lighter to pull. At the same time, specific division of labor was implemented. When planting, the strong pulled the seed drill, and the old and weak pulled the clod crusher. When harrowing, the children pressed the harrow. Li Fang's mother, who was in her fifties, not only participated in pulling the plow, but also called everyone to get up early every day at five o'clock. During meals, they discussed planting cotton and sorghum first, and then plowing millet land. After the demonstration by Li Zhang's group, two more poor peasant families joined his group. In ten days, Li Zhang led three full laborers and six half laborers, cultivated 34 mu of uncultivated land, and planted more than 50 mu of crops. During the rush planting period, they also took turns doing work for the military families. At present, everyone in the group is happily watching the seedlings and cotton grow day by day, and deeply experiencing the truth that "if you have cattle, rely on cattle, if you don't have cattle, you have to rely on people," and "many people have great power, and organizing can make us rich."

　　突破一点示范全村
  　新区组织互助经验
　  晋城
    五门村（新区），今年开始进行生产工作时，干部提出人人得互助的口号，勉强组织起来。如五门、南畔、山西底三个自然村便组成了三十五个组，共一百六十二人。但群众思想中的问题没有解决，组织是个形式，除了在突击犁地时变了几个工外，根本就没有动起来，连干部也没有参加互助组。
    群众有些什么思想问题呢？大概可分为下列几种：第一种：下地不如担挑赚钱；第二种：参加互助不自由不公道；第三种：人怕有钱猪怕肥，饿不死就行；第四种：将来虽然不斗争了，但是要看情况负担。村干部本身不参加互助，他们的理由说是因为工作多，实际上也是存在着这些思想阻碍。这些思想产生的根源来自两方面：一是因为不了解生产政策，对于组织起来顶机器，没有亲身体会，而对于组织起来生产致富还是惑疑；一是在土地改革中某些“平”的影响，使他们不敢放手生产。因此，他们对生产采取消极的态度，只顾眼前不受饿，担挑在外也可躲避支差。
    但也有另外一种情况，即在五门所有的互助组中，有两三个组坚持下去了，搞得很不错，这当中领导上抓紧对他们帮助，因而工作推进了一步，对全村说来起了示范作用。如五门王闹孩五个人的互助组，因为他们过去都是劳动最好的，有三户又是新翻身的基本群众，生产情绪很高，加上记工换工很认真（虽然还没有像采用工票制那样科学方便，一般的做到公平合理），领导上就表扬他们的积极性与办法好；南畔来生组三人变工（他们避免说互助，认为变工可以自由，互助不自由），原来一人早晨只能送三次粪，三人做一早晨却送四次；种谷时，三人拉耧，一天种十八亩，三天把自己的谷都种完了。领导上又宣传互助省工的情形，同时指明这样就是互助，给群众解下怕互助的包袱。
    同时，领导上又根据当时工作需要与群众情绪，提出了个“三不误”的口号，保证参战不误生产，空隙进行担挑运输。经过群众讨论，确定把全村全半劳力妇女、儿童一齐动员起来，具体分工，参加生产，整理差务，精确计算优抗人工，这样大大的发挥了组织的力量。
    如山西的研究支差问题，确定办法：清理三月以前的支差账，多挣少补；参战出长差的一月清理，在家的除还工给出差人家里种地外，每人先拿出一部分米，给出差的人作路费，使参战的人不感困难，高兴出去。回来以后要向村里汇报，好的表扬，不好的受批评。
    南畔妇女儿童组织的好，王兰英全组五十二亩麦，四天锄了四十三亩；儿童陡发组，六天也锄了三十多亩。这样，便把男全劳力腾出担炭运输，大家也干得很有劲头。正如小补旦说的：“以前我和爷爷一起去地，锄一锄看一看，熬煎的锄不完；跟陡发们一起去地，没多大一会就锄完了。”
    在这个运动中，群众逐渐克服了思想问题，互助情形已较有起色。现在干部不但参加互助，而且领导着大家干；群众不仅全劳力参加互助，连老太婆们也参加互助了。现在全行政村都要向他们学习。（亮之、鸿基，章青）

    八区东庄共有一百三十余户，一千七百亩土地，大小牛驴十八头。下雨后，群众看着村里仅有几犋牲口种不过来，很发愁。翻身农民李章，在“搞好一组、推动全村”的认识下，首先结合五家无牲口户拉犁三天，将十五亩茬地犁好耩上，接着又犁高粱地。五十八岁的老头李瑞兰和十七岁的小孩李方，膀子拉肿了，李瑞兰不愿干了，李章耐心的说明，“人养活地，地养活人，咱种不上小苗指望什么呢？”以后犁地便换成镬子犁，拉着轻。同时实行具体分工，耩地时壮年拉耧，老弱拉砘子。耙地时小孩压耙。李方五十多岁的母亲，不光参加拉犁，还每天喊五更，叫大家早起。吃饭时商量好先种棉花、高粱，然后再犁谷子地。经过李章组的示范，又有两家贫农参加他的组，十天时间，李章领导着三个整劳力，六个半劳力，耕白地三十四亩，播种庄稼五十多亩，抢种期间还轮流给军属做了活。目前组里都欢天喜地看着小苗和棉花一天天长出来，并深刻体验到“有牛靠牛、无牛就得靠人”，“人多力量大，组织起来能发家”的道理。（冀南分社）
