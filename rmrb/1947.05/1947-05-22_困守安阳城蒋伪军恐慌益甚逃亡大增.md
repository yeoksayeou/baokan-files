[Report from the North Henan Frontline, 18th] Chiang Kai-shek's troops in Anyang city are terrified and desertions are increasing daily. Xu Jinli, a soldier of the 3rd Company of the Engineering Battalion of the 40th Division of Chiang Kai-shek's army who recently escaped from Anyang city, stated: Since the People's Liberation Army recovered Tangyin, the Chiang Kai-shek troops in the city have become even more panicked, forcing soldiers to repair fortifications while hungry. The soldiers say, "Entering the prefecture (referring to Zhangde prefecture) means a miserable death; entering the stronghold means a quick death." They are all busy changing into plain clothes, trying to escape. In the 3rd Company of the Engineering Battalion alone, twelve people deserted in four days. Furthermore, Chen Jingchun, a soldier of the 40th Division of Chiang Kai-shek's army who escaped to our army, stated: The 40th Division is mostly composed of new recruits. The division has a draft-grabbing platoon stationed in Xinxiang. He was drafted after being caught buying cigarettes at Xinxiang railway station not long ago. On the night of the 13th, three Chiang Kai-shek sentries from Anyang also brought their weapons and defected to the People's Liberation Army.

[Report from the North Henan Frontline, 18th] Frontline reporter Chen Yongjin reports: Anyang has become a dead city of hunger and panic, with merchants and residents eagerly awaiting the Eighth Route Army. The city of Anyang is garrisoned by the 40th Division of Chiang Kai-shek's army and twenty-four Chiang Kai-shek refugee county governments in northern Henan, as well as remnants of Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops such as Wang Ziquan and Hu Quanlu, totaling more than 20,000 people. The grain of merchants and residents in the city has been looted by the Chiang Kai-shek troops. The common people can only eat one meal a day. Chiang Kai-shek's troops often go to the homes of merchants and residents to "eat" and rob food. If they see smoke rising from any house, they rush in to overturn the pot and grab food. If anyone dares to resist, the Chiang Kai-shek troops will say, "Communicating with the Eighth Route Army, arrest them." According to merchants and residents who escaped from the city: "The common people in the city are praying day and night: 'When will the Eighth Route Army attack the city? We will have food to eat when the city is opened!'" The Chiang Kai-shek soldiers also secretly say, "The Eighth Route Army should attack the city quickly, otherwise we will starve to death here as poor soldiers."

　　困守安阳城蒋伪军恐慌益甚逃亡大增
    【本报豫北前线十八日电】安阳城内蒋军恐慌胆战，逃亡日增。被日前由安阳城内逃来之蒋军第四十师工兵营第三连战士许进立称：自人民解放军收复汤阴后，城内蒋军更加恐慌，强令士兵饿着肚子赶修工事，士兵们说：“进了府，（指彰德府）死的苦；进了寨，死的快。”都忙着换便衣，设法逃跑，仅该工兵营第三连，四天内即逃亡十二人。又据逃来我军的蒋军四十师士兵陈景春称：四十师内多是新兵，该师有一个抓兵排，住在新乡，他就是不久以前在新乡车站买纸烟被抓来的。十三日夜又有安阳蒋军哨兵三人，携枪投来人民解放军。
    【本报豫北前线十八日电】前线记者陈勇进报导：安阳已成饥饿恐慌的死城，商民热望着八路军。安阳城里驻有蒋军第四十师和豫北廿四个蒋记流亡县政府，及王自全、扈全禄等蒋伪军残部，共两万余人。城内商民粮食已被蒋军抢光，老百姓每天只能吃到一顿饭，蒋军常到商民家里“就食”抢饭，看到谁家冒烟就跑去掀锅抢吃，如果谁敢反抗，蒋军就说：“通八路，押起来”。据城里跑出之商民谈：“城里的老百姓日夜祷告着：“八路什么时候打城呀，打开城就有饭吃啦！”蒋军士兵也暗地传说着：“八路军赶快打城吧，不然当个穷兵也脱不了饿死在这里。”
