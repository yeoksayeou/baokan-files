　　Thirty-Eighth Army Training Corps Helps Villagers Plow and Plant
    [Report from this newspaper] Since the Thirty-Eighth Army Training Corps moved to a certain village in February, the relationship between the army and the people has been quite good. The entire battalion has universally launched a "fill the water tank" campaign. For example, the Second Squad carried over 500 loads of water in more than fifty days. Trainee Han Yanglong alone carried more than 100 loads of water. Comrade Cao Quanfa from the First Squad treated 31 donkeys for the masses without taking any compensation. When the landlady of the Third Squad's First Platoon was away from home, her chickens laid seven or eight eggs, and the trainees carefully preserved them and returned them to the landlady. The second time the landlady was about to leave, she entrusted the chickens to the army to take care of. When new soldiers from the village joined the army, the training corps presented towels as a token of appreciation and sent representatives to see them off with flowers. When a portion of the trainees from the training corps went to the front lines, the villagers also voluntarily offered cigarettes as a token of appreciation, and a lively send-off ceremony was held with drums and gongs. On April 18th, the training corps conducted political education on army-people relations, emphasizing connecting with reality and improving the army-people relationship in the stationed village. In the morning, the students realized from the discussions that "We are the people's army, and observing mass discipline is not just a simple matter of reputation, but more importantly, it is for the benefit of our class of people." In the afternoon, four inspection teams were organized to investigate discipline, and the majority of the remaining people helped the masses with spring plowing. The entire battalion organized more than 290 people, each working for an average of two hours, helping nearly a hundred households of military families, poor peasants, and militia members participating in the war, plowing, planting, hoeing, watering, and cultivating over 40 mu of land, repairing 5,824 meters of field ridges, and carrying 232 large baskets of manure. Many comrades also collected firewood and carried water. Some landlords prepared noodles and bought cigarettes to treat the army, but the trainees politely declined. In the evening, the trainees discussed the situation of helping the masses that day, and many felt that this educational method was very good: first, it strengthened the concept of labor; second, it specifically solved the problem of army-people relations; third, only when we love the people will the people love us more. Everyone is also preparing to further help the masses with planting.

　　三十八军教导队帮驻村群众犁种
    【本报讯】自二月间三十八军教导队移驻某村后，军民关系搞的不错，全大队普遍开展满缸运动。如二队在五十余天中，共担水五百余担。仅学员韩养龙担水一百余担。一队曹全发同志不取任何代价给群众医好毛驴三十一头。三队一班房东老太太不在家，鸡下了七八个蛋，学员们很小心地保存起来，交还给老太太，第二次老太太又要走了，将鸡交给军队照管。当该村新战士参军时，教导队慰劳手巾派代表欢送戴花。当教导队有一部分学员上前线时，该村老百姓也自动慰劳纸烟，锣鼓喧天举行欢送。四月十八号教导队进行军民关系政治教育，强调连系实际，搞好驻村军民关系。上午，同学们从讨论中认识了“我们是人民军队，遵守群众纪律不仅是单纯名誉，更重要的是为了本阶级人民利益。”下午，组织四个检查组调查纪律，其余大部分人帮助群众春耕。全大队共组织二百九十余人，每人平均劳动了两个钟头，帮助军属、贫农、参战民兵等近百余家，犁、种、锄、浇、开地共四十余亩，修地垅五千八百二十四公尺，担粪二百三十二大筐，并有不少同志拾柴担水。有些房东做好面条买的纸烟招待军队，学员们都婉辞谢绝了。晚上，学员们讨论了当天帮助群众情形，很多人感到这种教育方法很好：第一，加强了劳动观念。第二，具体解决了军民关系。第三，只有我们热爱着人民，人民会更热爱着我们。大家并准备更进一步帮助群众下种。
