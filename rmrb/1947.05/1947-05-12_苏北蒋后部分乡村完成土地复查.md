Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 10th. Land re-examination has been completed in some villages in Northern Jiangsu under Chiang's control. In Lianshui County, 1,093 households of tenant farmers were allocated 18,420.6 mu of land in twenty days; 321 households of middle peasants were compensated for losses, with 708.7 mu of land; and the boundaries of 93,543.5 mu of land were demarcated. In Shuangdun District of Binhai (Xin County), one month of re-examination eliminated poverty, with an average of half a mu of land per person. In ×× Township alone, 180 new contracts were written. In the Dong District of Jianyang Dang, 4,030 households of farmers who received land beat gongs and drums, collectively going to the democratic government to pay taxes on the contracts. Considering the difficulties faced by the masses during the spring famine, the government exempted 4% of the land price in taxes, only charging for paper and ink. Women in Lianshui joined men in opposing feudalism, launching a movement to pursue, create, and establish women's property rights. In the villages along the Yan River, although the enemy frequently harassed them, women still carried banners in parades and demonstrations, organizing contract groups in villages. In × Village, women, led by the 70-year-old Grandma Jiang the Second, recovered old contracts from the local tyrant landlord Ma Yuejiang.
