　　Advocating Carrying Water for Spot Planting
    This year, the spring rains have been delayed, affecting sowing work in most areas. "Grain fills on Lesser Fullness, flowers bloom on Start of Summer." Now is precisely the season for sowing, and any slight懈怠 (slackening) will cause us to miss the timing. In several areas of Taihang, Taiyue, and Southern Hebei, carrying water for spot planting has already begun, and this method should be vigorously promoted.
    However, many people in various regions currently have a mindset of waiting for rain. We hope that district and village cadres and labor heroes will pay attention to learning from the experiences of advanced areas, using practical examples to illustrate that it is better to sow early than late, and that late sowing leads to reduced harvests. We should find ways to break the masses' waiting mentality and mobilize them to sow crops that can be spot-planted as punctually as possible. For crops that cannot be spot-planted, we must also achieve "rather have the seeds wait for the rain, than the rain wait for the seeds." We should sow the seeds first to avoid missing the timing and suffering major losses.
    The signs of spring drought have gradually become apparent, and paying attention to timely drought prevention is indeed urgent. We hope that all localities can pay attention to drought prevention work in a timely manner, like the Shahe County government, and call on all the people to fight against the drought. Many places in our region have had experience in organizing to overcome the natural disasters. We hope to vigorously promote past experience and use various methods to ensure that planting is not excessively affected by the lack of rain.

　　提倡挑水点种
    今年春雨失时，大部地区播种工作已受到影响。“小满谷子立夏花”，目前正是播种节令，如果稍一松懈，时间便会错过。太行、太岳、冀南若干地区，已开始挑水点种，这种办法，极宜大力推广。
    但不少地区群众，目前存有等雨思想，我们希望区村干部同志及劳动英雄们，注意学习先进地区的经验，用实际例子，说明赶早不赶晚，迟种少收成，设法打破群众等待心理。动员群众，能点种的作物，尽可能按时点种；不能点种的作物，也要做到“宁可籽等雨，不叫雨等籽”，先把籽播下去，以免错过时间，受到大的损失。
    春旱征象已逐渐明显了，注意及时进行防旱确已迫不及待，我们希望各地能像沙河县府一样，及时注意防旱工作，号召所有群众与天旱作斗争。我区不少地方曾有组织起来人定胜天的经验，希大力发扬过去经验，用各种方法做到不因缺雨而过分影响播种。
