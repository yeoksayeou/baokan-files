[This dispatch from the Taiyue Front on the 2nd] During the battle to capture Quwo, two model stretcher-bearers were commended by the troops. One was Zhang Yincun from Dongye Village, Erqu District, Yangcheng County. In the battle of Beiguan, he carried wounded soldier Yan Jianghai of a certain regiment's first battalion. At the time, the weather was cold, and Yan Jianghai was shivering. Zhang Yincun took off his cotton-padded coat and put it on the wounded soldier, while he himself carried the stretcher bare-backed. The other was Lang Zhiguo from Hehe Village, Erqu District. When the order came to transfer the wounded, he was ill and hadn't eaten all day, but he insisted on going. He took extra care of the wounded soldier along the way. The wounded soldier was very moved when they parted.

　　太岳部队表扬模范担架员
    【本报太岳前线二日电】在曲沃攻城战中，有二个模范担架员被部队表扬。一是阳城二区东冶村的张银寸，在北关战斗中抬着某团一营伤员阎江海，当时天气寒冷，阎江海冻得发抖，张银寸脱下棉衣，给伤员穿上，自己却赤着背膀抬担架。另一为二区合河村的郎治国，转运彩号的命令下来，他正在病中，且一天没吃饭，但他要求非去不行，路上还特别小心照护伤员。和伤员分别时，伤员很感动。
