　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: According to a Central News Agency report: All students of the National Jiaotong University in Shanghai have gone on strike and launched a large-scale petition movement to Beijing, disrupting the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. At 8:00 a.m. on the 13th, more than 2,000 students from the university boarded 48 large trucks and drove from Xujiahui to the North Railway Station to petition in Beijing. The university's president, Wu Baofeng, and Chiang Kai-shek's Deputy Minister of Education, Tian Peilin, along with Shanghai Mayor Wu Guozhen and Pan Gongzhan, Fang Zhi, Gu Yuxiu, and others came to "dissuade" them, but to no avail. Chiang Kai-shek's Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua, upon hearing the news, immediately flew to Shanghai with Deputy Minister of Transportation Ling Hongxun and arrived at the North Railway Station that afternoon. President Wu Baofeng also personally issued a large "notice," threatening the students: "Those who have not left the station by 6:30 p.m. or do not attend classes by 8:00 a.m. tomorrow will be expelled from the university." At this point, the students' emotions became even more intense, and they insisted on going to Beijing to petition. All the students rushed to climb onto the train, and male students directly drove the locomotive away from the North Railway Station and moved forward. The Chiang Kai-shek authorities, helpless, secretly ordered the railway bureau to dismantle the tracks, imposed martial law inside and outside the North Railway Station, and dispatched "Youth Army" and military police to suppress them. However, by the time the military police arrived, the students had already driven the train to Maigen Road. When the "Youth Army" caught up on a special train, the students had already reconnected the dismantled tracks and continued to move forward, driving straight to the Zhenru station. Thereupon, the railway bureau dismantled the tracks along the way, and the students dismantled and reconnected them, bravely advancing. After this incident occurred, the Beijing-Shanghai Railway was temporarily unable to operate, and on the 15th, the Beijing-Shanghai China Aviation Company was ordered to add flights. According to the Central News Agency: This strike and petition movement was caused by opposition to the Ministry of Education's changing of the school name and the closure of the ship management and turbine engineering departments. The truth of the matter is still unknown.

　　上海交大学生罢课自开火车赴京请愿
    【新华社陕北十六日电】据中央社消息：上海国立交通大学学生全体罢课并发动大规模之赴京请愿运动，京沪铁路已为之中断。十三日晨八时，该校学生二千余人分乘四十八辆大卡车，自徐家汇驰往北站赴京请愿。该校校长吴保丰及蒋记教育次长田培林，上海市长吴国桢及潘公展、方治、顾毓秀等纷纷前来“劝阻”，均告无效。蒋记教育部长朱家骅闻悉后，当即偕同交通部次长凌鸿勋于当日午飞沪赶抵北站。校长吴保丰又亲出大幅“布告”，威胁学生：“如于十八时半止尚未离站或明晨八时不上课者，决予开除学籍。”至此学生情绪益趋激烈，坚持赴京请愿。全体学生蜂涌攀登火车、由男学生径引驾驶机车离北站前进。蒋当局无奈、乃密令路局拆除路轨，北站内外实行戒严，并调派“青年军”与宪兵前往镇压。但军警赶到时，学生已驾车驶抵麦根路，待“青年军”乘专车赶上时，学生已将卸拆铁轨接通，继续前进，直驶真茹车站。于是路局沿路拆毁铁轨，学生则随拆随接，奋勇前进。此事发生后，京沪路一时无法通车，十五日京沪中航公司已奉令加开班机。据中央社称：此一罢课请愿运动，系由反对教育部更改校名及停办船管、轮机两科而起。实情究系如何，尚不得而知。
