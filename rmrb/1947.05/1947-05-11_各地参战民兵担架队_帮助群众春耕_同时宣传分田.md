　　Militia Stretcher Teams in Various Places Participate in Helping the Masses with Spring Ploughing, While Simultaneously Promoting Land Distribution

　　[Our Newspaper] When the Wu'an Fourth District stretcher team stopped near a village near Tangyin City, Secretary Gao Sizheng proposed helping the masses weed and pull grass for wheat. This proposal was immediately praised by Instructor Cui Zhengliang, who said, "Our brigade headquarters should set an example first." After investigating the situation in the village, on the morning of the 26th, Comrade Cui Zhengliang personally led Secretary Gao Sizhi, propagandist Han Jun, correspondent Cui Zezhi, Cui Maze and other nine people to weed the wheat for the landlord (tenant farmer). The six people forgot their fatigue as they talked and weeded, and they weeded ten and a half mu in one morning. Influenced by the comrades of the brigade headquarters, the whole team launched a movement to help weed seedlings and fill water jars. They not only helped the masses with work, but also took time to collect firewood. They built walls, dams, and delivered manure for the villagers, and also carried out propaganda work, telling the local villagers about the situation of liberation in the liberated areas and the happy life after liberation, so they had a very good relationship with the masses.

　　[Also reported] The participating militia and stretchers in Wu'an Fifth District saved 475 jin of millet to help the local poor brothers. This exemplary action influenced the participating personnel in the whole county, who automatically discussed ways to save. They unanimously decided to save two liang of millet per person per day, saving a total of 2,262 jin of millet. They also took time to help the masses with weeding wheat, carrying water, and delivering manure. In addition, the repair group of the Second Detachment repaired more than 250 pots and 72 washbasins for the people in Loulou Town within three days.

　　[Our Newspaper] After the Hu and Ping militia stretchers arrived in the new district of Tangyin, they paid special attention to discipline towards the masses. Whenever they stayed in a village, they carried water and cleaned for the landlord, and at any time propagandized the news of liberation in Hu and Ping to everyone. Each team also put forward the slogan: "Launch a movement to love the people"; in a few days, in addition to carrying wounded soldiers and escorting prisoners, they helped the masses in the駐地 weed 375 mu of wheat and carried 599 loads of manure. The Third Brigade helped the masses solve 11 burdens, and drew out stonemasons to grind for the masses. They automatically collected 3,312 jin of firewood, which was calculated at five yuan per jin, saving a total of 125,610 yuan in firewood. The Third Brigade compiled 221 rain capes, selling them for 17,620 yuan, improving their own lives, and gaining the support of the masses everywhere. (Zhi Qing, Tu Rui, Xue Kong)
　　[Our Newspaper, Ji'nan, 9th] When the Qinghe Third Deputy Stretcher Team was stationed in Sanzhuang, Qingfeng County, they investigated and found that six military families in the village had difficulties. Everyone discussed and brewed it at night: "Helping others here is the same as helping others at home." Wang Shiwen, Zhang Fulu, Zhang Hengchang and others were the first to volunteer to help military families with work, and then everyone wanted to go. The next day, according to the difficulties of the military families, more than 80 people went, and the rest helped the landlords with work. Wu Jicheng, Wu Jinsuo and others were the most active in pushing manure for military families, going back and forth four or five miles, the carts were full, and they pushed quickly. In one day, they sent all the manure of the military families to the ground. More than 30 people including Li Zuori built houses for military families, and built five houses in a row. When the military families wanted to boil water for them, they also said to the military families: "Don't boil it, firewood is expensive, the public has given us supplies and firewood, let's go back and drink it." An eighty-year-old man was so moved that he said: "People now are not only liberated, but their hearts have become better." This group of stretcher bearers stayed there for five days. Except for the first day of rest, they helped the people like this every day thereafter. When they accepted the task and left there, the people there sent them a long way, reluctantly saying: "If you pass by here in the future, be sure to come home for dinner."
