　　Establishing the Banner of Fighting Behind Enemy Lines
    The Hua County Party Committee Calls for Launching the Liu Guanglu Movement
    [Our Newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 22nd] The Hua County Party Committee has decided to launch the Liu Guanglu Movement. Liu Guanglu was originally the director of the Sixth Team Joint Association. In logistics work, he was a model leader of stretcher teams, and in guerrilla warfare, he was a model of persisting in guerrilla warfare. Every time, he resolutely completed the tasks assigned to him by the Party, unafraid of danger and difficulty, sticking to his post without complaint. In addition to commendation, the County Party Committee promoted him to Secretary of the District Committee. In its decision to launch the Liu Guanglu Movement, the County Party Committee called on all county mass members, cadres, and militia to actively learn from Comrade Liu Guanglu, and in the campaign to commend models and establish merit, they should also use Comrade Liu Guanglu as an example to examine themselves.
    [Our Newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 22nd] Comrade Liu Guanglu is from the Sixth District of Hua County. He worked as a hired laborer for landlords for eight years, suffering exploitation. After participating in the rent reduction movement in Xishan, Hua County, in 1943, he returned to his village to take the lead in organizing the farmers' association. He joined the Communist Party in 1944. He transformed from a village leader into a district leader. Because of his active work and exemplary performance everywhere, he was promoted to Director of the District Joint Association in the autumn of 1945. When the Self-Defense War began, he led stretcher bearers from the Sixth District to participate in the battle, separated from the enemy by only a dike. The battle was extremely fierce, and some cadres and stretcher bearers wavered for a time. Comrade Guanglu, on the one hand, mobilized the stretcher bearers to feel at ease, and on the other hand, personally and calmly went to the front line to collect the wounded twice in a row. After the enemy occupied Hua County, the County Party Committee decided that Comrade Liu Guanglu should go to the most tense southeastern part of the Sixth District to persist in the struggle. Comrade Guanglu immediately went in with three cadres and eight militiamen, opening up the situation in several villages. Although the enemy carried out several encirclements and suppressions, he always persisted in his position. Once, last December, when the armed work team set out to investigate the situation, Comrade Guanglu himself stood guard for four hundred people. The weather was very cold at the time, but he did not feel it was bitter at all. Comrade Liu Guanglu has a very good relationship with the cadres in the Sixth District and believes that he is not as good as others. Although he has been commended, he is not arrogant at all. His spirit of learning is very good. When he joined the Party, he only knew a few words, but now he can read newspapers and letters. After the war, Comrade Liu Guanglu has become even stronger. He often says: "As long as there is the Communist Party, there will be Liu Guanglu."

　　树立奋战敌后的旗帜
    滑县县委号召开展刘光禄运动
    【本报冀鲁豫二十二日电】滑县县委会决定开展刘光禄运动。刘光禄原为六队联合会主任，在战勤工作中他是领导担架模范，在游击战中又是坚持游击战争的模范，每次他坚决完成党给他的任务，不怕危险与困难，坚持自己岗位，从无怨言。县委会除表扬外，并提拔为区委书记。县委会开展刘光禄运动决定中，号召全县群众党员干部、民兵，积极向刘光禄同志学习，在表模立功运动中，亦应以刘光禄同志作榜样来检讨自己。
    【本报冀鲁豫二十二日电】刘光禄同志是滑县六区人，曾给地主当过八年雇工，受尽地主的剥削，一九四三年他参加滑县西山再的增资运动后，即回村带头组织农会。一九四四年参加共产党，他由一个村的领袖，变为一个区的领袖，由于他工作积极，处处表现模范，所以在一九四五年秋即被提拔为区联合会主任。自卫战争开始，他率六区担架参加战斗，和敌人只隔一道堤，战斗异常激烈，有些干部及担架队员一时表现动摇，而光禄同志一面动员担架队员安心，一面亲自从容上火线连续二次彩号。自敌人占滑县城后，县委会决定刘光禄同志到最紧张的六区东南坚持斗争，光禄同志即同三个干部和八个民兵插进去，打开几个村的局面，虽敌人清剿数次，但他始终坚持阵地。去年十二月转移到旁地，有一次武工队出发侦察情况，光禄同志自己替四百人站岗，当时天气很冷，但他毫不以为苦。刘光禄同志与六区干部都有很好的关系，认为自己不如别人，虽受到表扬，但毫不自高自大。他的学习精神很好，入党时只认识几个字，目前已能看报纸和信件了。经过了战争，刘光禄同志已锻炼的更坚强，他常说：“只要有共产党便有我刘光禄。”
