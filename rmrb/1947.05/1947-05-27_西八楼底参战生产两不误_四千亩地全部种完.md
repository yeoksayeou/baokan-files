　　West Balou Bottom Combines Participation in the War Effort with Production
  　Completing Sowing on All 4,000 Mu of Land
    [Report from Changzhi by our newspaper] In the fifth district, the villages of West Ba and North Lou Di have completed the spring planting of over 4,200 mu of land, five days ahead of schedule, while fulfilling their war participation tasks. The main reasons are: First, improved relations between cadres and the masses. In past years, the masses' experience was that mutual assistance with cadres resulted in the cadres being more often absent from work, owing labor that they were afraid the cadres wouldn't be able to repay, and suffering losses. They thus didn't want to engage in mutual aid with cadres. Based on the masses' thinking, the cadres made a deep self-criticism, unanimously agreeing that the masses' opinions are the guiding principles for the cadres' future work. Consequently, a mass meeting was convened to announce the task and policy for this year: "Achieve victory in both war participation and production." The cadres made a self-criticism of their past shortcomings in front of the masses, and determined that future office work would not take up production time, with office work done at night and production during the day. Only then did the relationship between cadres and masses become harmonious, and the cadres were divided into groups to lead the spring plowing. Second, resolving outstanding issues. After the cadres were divided into groups, they first tried to understand the concerns of the masses. Superficially, there was pleasant conversation, but in reality, there were problems that were difficult to discuss, and the enthusiasm for production was not high. Most of these were old middle peasants. Last year, the mutual aid wages were not completely settled. At that time, they were afraid of struggle, but this year, after hearing the government's call, their thinking was very different, and they demanded a settlement of wages. The groups of Song Xiulin, Cui Pangze, and Xu Youming in West Ba, and the groups of Zhang Heqi and Song Tuwang in Lou Di, solved more than ten wage issues and more than ten scattered land issues, settling all debts. Those who could repay with labor did so, and those who could not repay with labor at that time would repay with women's weaving later. In this way, the turned-over masses were taken care of, and the problems of the old middle peasants were also resolved, and the enthusiasm for production surged. Third, mobilizing women, children, and the elderly. First, the concept that women and children never did labor was broken, and then the old sayings of the masses over the years were also turned into slogans for a concentrated effort in spring plowing: "Early sowing brings harvest every year, late sowing depends on the year's conditions; seize the moment and don't delay, beware of drought; if spring plowing is not tight, the whole year's belly will be loose; if you fall behind one step, you will be in a hurry every step." Under this encouragement, 257 women, children, and elderly people participated in labor in West Ba, and 70 participated in Lou Di, cultivating more than 1,400 mu of land, accounting for one-third of the village's land. Fourth, education and rewards are an effective way to improve mutual aid groups. Whether they are old middle peasants or turned-over masses, they have a strong desire to win and like praise but do not like criticism. For example, the old middle peasants have always been afraid of having their "leeks cut" since the mass movement. If you criticize them as being backward elements, their production enthusiasm will be even more depressed. The method of rewarding and praising is adopted, with street blackboard commendations, winning banners, and the production committee also preparing some prizes to reward model groups and model people. When the news spread, everyone's enthusiasm increased even more. (Kai Di)

　　西八楼底参战生产两不误
  　四千亩地全部种完
    【本报长治讯】五区西八、北楼底村，在完成参战任务下，四千二百余亩土地春耕下种，现已提前五日全部完成。主要原因由于第一、改善干部与群众关系。群众历年的经验是与干部互助干部误工多，欠下工怕干部还不了，吃干部亏，不和干部互助。根据群众思想，干部作了深刻的检讨，一致认为群众意见即是干部今后工作的指南，随召开群众大会，宣布今年任务方针：“参战生产两胜利”，干部在群众面前检讨了过去毛病，确定了今后办公不占生产时间，黑夜办公白天生产。干部群众关系才得到融洽，干部分入各组领导春耕。第二、解决遗留问题。干部分入各组后，首先摸群众心事，表面光，面谈欢，实际有问题，碍口不谈，生产劲头不大，多半是旧中农，去年互助工资未彻底清算，当时怕斗争，今年听到政府号召，思想大不同了，要求清算工资。西八宋秀林组、崔胖则组、徐有名组，楼底张和气组、宋土旺组，共解决了工资问题十余件、零星土地问题十余件，将谁欠谁的工资一律算清，能还工的还工，当时不能还工的随后妇女纺织还工。这样，照顾了翻身群众，也解决了旧中农问题，生产劲头蓬勃高涨。第三、发动妇女、儿童、老汉。首先打破妇女、儿童从来不劳动的观念，接着把历年群众老俗话也变成突击春耕下种的口号：“早种年年收，迟种碰年头，趁早不趁晚，防备天气旱，春耕不抓紧，全年肚皮松，一步赶不上，步步都着慌。”这样鼓舞下，西八参加劳动妇女、儿童、老汉二百五十七个，楼底参加七十个。共耕地一千四百余亩，占全村土地三分之一。第四、教育奖励是提高互助组的有效办法。不论旧中农翻身群众，争胜心很大，喜欢夸奖而不喜欢批评。如旧中农自群运以来一贯怕割韭菜，你要批评它是个落后分子，生产情绪就更加消沉。采取奖励表扬办法，街头黑板表扬，优胜旗，生产委员会并准备些奖品，奖励模范组，模范人，消息传出，大家劲头越加大起来。（开弟）
