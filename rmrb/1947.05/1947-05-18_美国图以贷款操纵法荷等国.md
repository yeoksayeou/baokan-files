Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: According to a United Press Washington dispatch: The World Bank has recently announced a loan of $250 million to France for its "revival" and "to modernize the country." Note: At a time when the political situation in France is turbulent, American imperialism is providing France with a huge loan, and the subtle clues are worthy of attention. The World Bank is a product of the 1944 International Monetary and Financial Conference. At present, the bank is completely controlled by the United States and has become a tool for the United States to carry out foreign expansion.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th: TASS, The Hague: Dutch newspapers recently reported on the proposed US loan to the Netherlands. A powerful spokesman for the Dutch government, Kortan Hess of the Catholic Party, recently declared: "The Americans can help us. Huge American capital must be invested in our industry. Dutch industrialists should also seek private loans from the United States." He also said that the United States has "great strategic and economic interests" in Indonesia. The Waayahead newspaper commented on this: "We deeply understand what the Dutch reactionaries want to do. They are trying to sell Indonesia to American trusts and military leaders at the highest possible price. They want to turn the Netherlands into a colony of American capital. Our country is facing danger. Prime Minister Bijl, Ministers Jonkman Reeflek, and Van Mook are planning to go to Washington to sell our country's independence. But they have forgotten that the Dutch people, who have paid a heavy price for freedom, oppose this traitorous path and will do everything in their power to fight for independence."
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: Under the smoke screen of "relief," American imperialism is stepping up its expansionist policy. According to the US News Service: The US Senate passed a bill on the 14th, stipulating that the United States will issue $350 million in "relief" to countries damaged by the war. Marshall has hinted that this "relief" will be given to Austria, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Poland, and the Chiang Kai-shek government.

　　美国图以贷款操纵法荷等国
    【新华社陕北十四日电】据合众社华盛顿讯：世界银行顷宣布贷款二万万五千万美元予法国，供其“复兴”及“使国家趋于现代化”之用。按：正当目前法国政局动荡之际，美帝国主义又予法以巨额贷款，其间蛛丝马迹，颇堪注视。世界银行是一九四四年国际货币金融会议的产物、目前该行完全在美国把持下，成为美国对外进行扩张的一个工具。
    【新华社陕北十二日电】塔斯社海牙讯：荷兰各报顷报导拟议中的美国对荷贷款问题。荷兰政府有势力的发言人天主教党的柯尔坦荷斯最近宣称：“美国人可以帮助我们，巨大的美国资本必须投资于我们的工业，荷兰的实业家们亦应向美国求取私人借贷。”他又说：美国对印度尼西亚有“很大的战略与经济的兴趣”。瓦亚海德报对此评称：“我们十分深切了解荷兰反动派要干什么，他们正力图以可能的较高价格出卖印度尼西亚给美国的托拉斯及军事领袖们，他们要将荷兰变为美国资本的殖民地。我们的国家正面临着危险。内阁总理比吉尔、部长容克曼李夫了克和樊穆克正筹划去华盛顿，以出卖我国的独立。但他们忘记了为自由已付出重大代价的荷兰人民反对这种卖国路线，并将竭尽全力为独立而奋斗。”
    【新华社陕北十六日电】美帝国主义在“救济”烟幕下，加紧推行扩张政策。据美新闻处讯：美参院于十四日通过议案，规定美国发出三亿五千万美元“救济”遭战争破坏之各国。马歇尔已暗示，此项“救济”给予奥、希、匈、意、波等国及蒋介石政府。
