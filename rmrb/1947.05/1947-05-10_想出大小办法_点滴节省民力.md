　　Think of All Methods, Big and Small
    Conserve the People's Strength Drop by Drop
    South Qinghe: Jointly Hiring Laborers Saves Grass and Feed
    [Our Newspaper Taihang News] The First District is universally developing livestock breeding to solve the difficulty of animal power. In all counties, whether mountainous or plains, livestock is extremely lacking due to enemy destruction. After precise calculations and research discussions, Nanqinghe in Zanhuang believes that increasing livestock by simply buying and selling from east to west cannot solve the fundamental problem. Village Chief Wang Fuyi and Cooperative Director He Laoguang said, "If we want to completely solve the livestock problem, we can only strengthen livestock breeding." The masses automatically requested, "Let's organize the livestock of each household in our village into groups, jointly hire a herdsman, which will save feed and grass, and also increase livestock; now buying a catty of grass costs ten yuan, and a livestock has to eat eight catties of grass a day, which costs eighty yuan, and feed is calculated at forty yuan per catty, costing one hundred and twenty yuan a day, whether the livestock is used or not. Seventy-four or five livestock cost 26,820 yuan per month, and 321,840 yuan per year, which is too large an expense." In addition, the masses said, "Our Chairman Mao calls for thrift, if we get our village's cattle herd going, we can save a lot of money." Later, a cadre meeting was held for research, and a livestock breeding committee was established, a herdsman was hired, and the treatment for the herdsman was studied, and it was decided that the cooperative would buy a male donkey to speed up breeding. The masses all said, "This is great." This plan can solve the difficulty of livestock shortage in three years. Currently, all counties in the First District are universally organizing cattle herds to carry out livestock breeding. The bank attaches great importance to this work and strongly supports it, allocating a special fund of 5.6 million yuan for livestock breeding, of which 3.2 million yuan has been loaned out. According to incomplete statistics, forty male donkeys and bulls have been purchased. (Shuang Qing)
    Hou Xiyu: Setting up a Rest Stop During Grain Transport Saves 300 Labor Days and 200,000 Yuan
    [Our Newspaper She County News] Hou Xiyu Village in the Third District has recently achieved significant results in its participation in the war effort, and the relationship between cadres and the masses has become closer. When the village mobilized to transport public grain a few days ago, the masses raised many difficulties, mainly the cost of staying in hotels (eating noodles and renting quilts) and delaying spring plowing. Cadres and the masses jointly studied ways to save manpower, livestock power, and financial resources. It was decided that the elderly and children in the village would set up a rest stop midway, starting directly from the grain storage village, without having to return to the village, and also solving the problem of eating and lodging. After the rest stop was established, it originally took twelve days to complete the transport, but it was completed in nine days. The laborers ate their own food and covered themselves with their own quilts at the station, without spending a penny. The village dispatched a total of seventy-eight people and forty-seven livestock, saving two hundred and thirty-four labor days and one hundred and forty-one livestock labor days; calculating three bowls of noodles and one quilt rental per person per night, each person saved 3,150 yuan, for a total saving of 246,000 yuan.

    North Siqu District: Using Market Days to Send Newspapers
    [Our Newspaper Lingchuan News] Because the North Siqu District sent newspapers too slowly, and also had to send people to pick them up, wasting the people's strength, under the leadership of Comrade Zhang Song, a method was created: First, agree with the small shop opened by their district in Qianbingzhang, and then agree with the Transportation Bureau to send the newspapers directly to the small shop for distribution, and tell the masses that they have a responsibility to bring back the newspapers every day when they go to the market. This saves a lot of the people's strength in fourteen villages, and the masses can see the newspapers every other day, as people go to the market every single day. (Chuan Fang)
    [Our Newspaper Pingshun News] Responding to the call to cherish the people's strength, the cadres of the Fourth District checked the fuel consumption of their district office and found that too much of the people's strength had been wasted in the past. They immediately studied the issue of switching to burning coal. At this time, the district was about to transport grain to a certain village, so the district office seized this opportunity, sent cadres to buy coal, and organized the grain-transporting masses to transport the coal back, a total of 12,000 catties of coal. The purchase price plus transportation costs was less than the cost of buying firewood for the whole year, saving 21,600 yuan, and saving more than 1,000 labor days for the villages to deliver firewood in the past. Saving money and labor, the masses are very satisfied. (Lai Fu)

　　想出大小办法
    点滴节省民力
    南清河  合雇牛工省草省料
    【本报太行讯】一分区普遍开展繁殖牲口，解决畜力困难。各县不论山川平原，由于敌人摧残，牲口极为缺乏。赞皇南清河经过精确计算和研究讨论，要想增加牲口，单靠东买西贩是解决不了根本问题的。村长王付义，合作社长何老广说：“要想彻底解决牲口问题，只有加强繁殖牲口。”群众自动要求说：“把咱村各户的牲口组织成群，共雇一个放牛人，又省料，又省草，还能增加牲口；现在买一斤草须洋十元，一个牲口每天得吃八斤草，就须洋八十元，料按一斤算须洋四十元，每天不管用牲口不用，都须洋一百二十元，七十四、五头牲口，每个月须洋二万六千八百二十元，全年须洋三十二万一千八百四十元，这一笔开支数太大了。”另外群众说：“咱们毛主席号召节约，如果把咱村牛群搞起来，可节约好多钱。”后来召开干部会，进行研究，成立了一个牲口繁殖委员会，雇了牛工，研究了放牛的待遇，决定由合作社买一个叫驴，加紧繁殖。群众都说：“这可好极了。”这样计划三年即可解决了牲口缺的困难。现一分区各县普遍都在组织牛群，进行繁殖牲口。银行对这工作非常重视，用大力来扶持，专拨资金五百六十万元来作繁殖牲口用，现已贷出三百二十万元，据不完全统计，已买公驴公牛四十头。（双庆）
    后西峪  运粮中途设招待站  省工三百省钱廿万
    【本报涉县讯】三区后西峪村最近参战工作获显著成绩，干群关系益趋密切。该村日前动员运输公粮时，群众提出许多困难，主要是住店花钱（要吃面和赁被子）和耽误春耕。干部和群众共同研究节省人、畜、财力办法。决定由本村老头儿童在中途设一招待站，从囤粮村庄直接起运，不需绕回本村，还可解决吃、住问题。招待站组成后，原来需要十二天运完，结果九天就完成了。民夫到站吃自己饭，盖自己被子，一个钱也不花。该村共出差七十八人，牲口四十七头，节约人工二百三十四个，畜工一百四十一个；一人住店一夜以吃三碗面、赁一条被计，每人省钱三千一百五十元，共省钱二十四万六千元。（增元）
    北四渠学区  利用赶集发报
    【本报陵川讯】北四渠学区，因为送报纸太慢，同时还得派人来取，浪费民力，在张松同志的领导下，创造了办法：首先和他们本学区在乾炳掌合伙开的小铺说好，然后和交通局说好，把报直送到小铺分发，回去告诉群众，每日来赶集都有责任捎回报纸，这样十四个村节省民力很大，群众单日都有人赶集，隔一日就能看到报纸。（传芳）
    【本报平顺讯】四区区干部响应爱惜民力号召，检查了自己区署的烧柴问题，发现过去浪费民力太大，当即研究了改烧煤炭问题。恰好此时该区要往某村运粮，区署即抓住这个机会，派干部前去买煤，组织运粮群众回运，共运回煤一万二千斤，每斤买价加上脚力，比买柴烧全年可省二万一千六百元，并节省下过去由各村送柴工一千多个。又省钱又省工，群众都很满意。（来福）
