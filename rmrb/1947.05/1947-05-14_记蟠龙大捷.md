　　A Record of the Great Victory at Panlong
    (Special Correspondent of Xinhua News Agency, Lin Lang)
    The people's fighters anxiously spent two days of continuous rain. On the evening of the second day, a northwest wind started blowing, and everyone happily and quickly completed all combat preparations. The tragic scenes of the suffering of the masses under the trampling of the Jiang-Hu troops ignited the blood of every single person.
    On the third day, in the faint mist of dawn, dense gunfire erupted simultaneously on the mountains within a ten-mile radius centered on Panlong. On these dozens of mountains of varying heights, on the mountainsides and slopes, the enemy had built countless strong fortifications and defense points. In the gullies and paths, the enemy's camping holes were densely packed like honeycombs. After half an hour of fierce exchange of fire, a certain unit of the Northwest People's Liberation Army quickly seized several of the Jiang army's lower positions and immediately entered the enemy's built fortifications. The enemy hurriedly ran to the fortifications on the high mountains, blindly sweeping with light and heavy machine guns without daring to show their heads, and bombarding with mountain guns and mortars. The shells all landed on the distant mountains, raising bursts of dust. The enemy was indulging in wasting American ammunition.
    Soon two planes flew low to assist in the battle, strafing wildly with machine guns. A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army immediately fired upon them, one of which immediately caught fire and landed to the south, while the other fled in panic. From then on, Jiang's planes dared not fly low again.
    At 3:30 in the afternoon, a fierce battle of contention began. Everyone's emotions and efforts were focused on Jimu Mao, one thousand meters east of Panlong. This was the highest mountain; occupying it would allow them to overlook everything and control everything. The enemy's strongest fortifications were here.
    First, the people's artillerymen began to accurately fire, each shell landing precisely in the enemy's fortifications. The battalion commander of the 5th company, 2nd battalion, 499th regiment, 167th brigade was killed by a direct hit, and the entire company immediately became panicked; thus, the enemy urgently transferred the 4th company to replace them. After another continuous bombardment, the mountaintop was covered in smoke. At this time, the infantry bravely ran up the thousand-meter-high peak and approached the enemy's outer trench fortifications in ten minutes. They immediately threw grenades, rushed through the six-foot-wide, seven-foot-deep outer trench, rushed through the barbed wire, and entered the enemy's machine gun bunkers and individual trenches; finally, they ended the battle by raising their gleaming bayonets. Twenty-odd surviving enemies laid down their weapons, and sixty-odd corpses lay sitting, lying, or prostrate in the fortifications, with another ten-odd wounded enemies groaning. The captured bitterly pleaded, "We were forced, we had no choice!" One prisoner with his head wrapped in cloth took out a pot cake from his dry food bag and offered it to the People's Liberation Army soldiers, but everyone declined. This was because the cake was made from flour robbed from the common people, after they had burned the common people's windows and doors, and then smashed the common people's pots.
    The reporter inspected the complex and strong fortifications occupying the entire mountain top, thinking that it had taken Jiang more than twenty days to construct it, while the People's Liberation Army had occupied it in one hour. To defend it, a company of Jiang-Hu troops had made a futile sacrifice; while the People's Liberation Army had only paid the price of a dozen or so casualties. Everywhere on the mountain were the common people's doors, trees, pot lids, clothes, grain, and wheat straw. Some pots of beef and mutton were still steaming, while the skins and bones of cattle and sheep were scattered all over the mountains and fields. But at this time, the peasants were crying because they had no cattle to till the land, and countless lambs were crying because they had no ewes to suckle! All this made people think that Chiang Kai-shek was a plague, symbolizing death and destruction. Our Northwest People's Liberation Army, together with other fraternal armies of the Liberation Army, are gloriously fighting to extinguish this plague. After the occupation of Jimu Mao, the people's armed forces held the advantage from then on.
    The evening passed, and the nearly full moon climbed over the mountain top. At this time, the meritorious soldiers of a certain unit who had attacked and captured the position retreated to rest, while another unit came to carry out new attack missions. They were all young, heroic, and orderly ranks, passing each other shoulder to shoulder, smiling and greeting each other: "Comrades, our mission is completed, you quickly take that village!" "Don't worry, no problem."
    At this time, everyone was carrying out their tasks tensely and seriously: engineers clearing landmines, artillerymen observing the position, telephone operators setting up wires, medical personnel giving first aid to the wounded, cooks delivering water and food... The Yan'an guerrillas and the Yongping guerrillas enthusiastically rushed to participate in the battle with rifles and grenades, and stretcher bearers carefully carried the wounded. But most were still resting, leisurely smoking cigarettes. The masses from nearby villages came voluntarily to build fortifications and level the enemy's fortifications. They affectionately said to the soldiers: "You must protect yourselves well."
    Everything was ready, and a new action began again. The commander resolutely ordered: "Capture alive Brigade Commander Li Kungang and recover Panlong Town."
    After another day and night of fierce fighting, all the mountains and fortifications were occupied by the People's Liberation Army, leaving only the enemies on a small mound on the west side still resisting desperately. At dusk, the bugle call for the charge sounded. People's warriors from the east, west, south, from all the mountains, rushed towards Panlong Town with an overwhelming momentum. The covering artillery and machine gun fire roared together, and soon the soldiers' shouts drowned out the sound of gunfire. At this time, the Jiang-Hu troops in Panlong Town were extremely panicked. They fled from the street into the houses in groups, and then fled from the houses to the upper gullies, climbed into the cave dwellings, but immediately climbed out of the cave dwellings to the streets... At this time, a dozen people formed a group and desperately fled to the north. A certain commander of the Liberation Army shouted, "Catch them!" It turned out that this was Brigade Commander Li Kungang and his senior commanders. They dared not flee to Qinghuabian, thirty li to the south, and chose Wayaobao, eighty li away. These captured senior officers were yesterday relying on its strong fortifications to resist stubbornly, but now they could only helplessly be captured alive.
    In the bright moonlight, the reporter entered the shattered Panlong and saw groups of Jiang-Hu army prisoners wearing wide leather-edged military caps and American-style traitor uniforms being escorted by cooks and grooms to the Liberation Army camp. More than a thousand mules and horses were pulled out of various stables and loaded with captured weapons. The houses in the street were piled with flour, military uniforms, shoes, salt, and cigarettes. The clothing and supplies of Jiang-Hu army's nine brigades were all finished from then on.
    Panlong used to be a bustling town, but now it has been quickly destroyed by Chiang Kai-shek's demonic hands. Only two old women were seen on the entire street. They invited the reporter in to drink water and earnestly said: "It's good that you have come!"

　　记蟠龙大捷
    （新华社特派记者林朗）
    人民战士们焦急的渡过了两天的连绵阴雨，二日黄昏刮起了西北风，大家都高兴的迅速完成了一切战斗准备。眼前群众所遭受蒋胡军蹂躏的悲惨景象，使得每一个人的血都在沸腾。
    三日，在晨光熹微的薄雾中，以蟠龙为中心的十里圆周内的群山上，同时响起稠密的枪声。在这几十个高低不一的山头上，山腰间和山坡旁，筑有敌人无数强固工事与防御点。在沟洼小道里，蜂窝似的密布着敌人的宿营穴。经过半小时激烈枪炮互射，西北人民解放军某部就迅速夺取了蒋军几个较低的阵地，立即进入敌人筑好的工事。敌人慌忙跑到高山的工事里，不敢露头地用轻重机枪拚命盲目扫射，用山炮、迫击炮轰击。炮弹都落在远处的山上，扬起了一阵阵灰土。敌人在尽情地浪费着美国人的弹药。
    不久两架飞机低飞来助战了，用机枪疯狂低飞扫射。人民解放军某部立即加以射击，其中一架马上着火向南降落，另一架慌张地逃去。从此蒋机再不敢低飞了。
    下午三时半，激烈的争夺战开始了。大家的情绪和努力都贯注到蟠龙东一千米的积牧峁。这是一架最高的山，占领了它就可以俯瞰一切，控制一切。敌人最强大的工事就在这里。
    首先人民炮手开始准确的射击，一颗颗炮弹都正好落在敌人的工事里。一六七旅四九九团二营五连连长被击中毙命了，全连马上慌乱起来；于是敌人急调四连来换防。又经过一阵连续的轰击，使山头上烟雾弥天。这时候，步兵群勇敢的跑上一千米达的高处，十分钟就接近了敌人的外壕工事。立即投掷手榴弹，冲过六尺宽，七尺深的外壕圈，冲过铁丝网，进入敌人的机枪掩体和单人壕；最后举起明晃晃的刺刀解决了战斗。二十几个活着的敌人放下了武器，六十几具尸体或坐或仰或俯的留在工事里，还有十几个受伤的敌人在呻吟。被俘者苦痛的申述“我们被强迫的，没办法啦！”有一个以布裹头的俘虏，从干粮袋中取出锅饼请解放军战士们吃，大家都谢绝了。因为这个饼是向老百姓抢来的面粉，烧了老百姓的窗门，随后又把老百姓的锅打烂了。
    记者巡视占有整个山头的复杂的强固的工事，想到它曾经化费了蒋二十多天的经营，而人民解放军在一小时内就占领了。为着据守它，蒋胡军一个连已作了无谓牺牲；而人民解放军只付出十几名伤亡的代价。满山上到处都是老百姓的门板、树木、锅盖、衣服、粮食和麦草，有些锅里煮着的牛肉、羊肉还冒着热气，而满山遍野正丢着牛羊的皮和骨头。可是农民们这时候正为着没有牛耕种而哭泣，无数的小羊正为着没有母羊哺乳而嗥叫！这一切使人想到蒋介石就是瘟疫，它象征着死亡和毁灭。我西北人民解放军正与其他解放军兄弟军队，为着扑灭这股瘟疫而光荣的战斗着，积牧峁占领后，人民武装从此握着优势。
    黄昏过去了，将圆的月亮爬上山头。这时攻战阵地的某部有功的战士退下去休息，而由另一部来执行新的攻击任务。他们都是年青、英武、整齐的队列，相对的擦肩而过，互相微笑地打着招呼：“同志，我们的任务完成了，你们快拿下那个寨子吧！”“放心吧没问题”。
    这时每个人都紧张的严肃的执行自己的任务：工兵扫清地雷，炮兵观察阵地，电话员架设电线，卫生员急救伤员，炊事员送水送饭……。延安游击队，永坪游击队拿着步枪手榴弹热情地赶来参战，担架队员小心翼翼地抬着伤员。但大部还在休息，悠闲的抽着纸烟。附近村庄中的群众，纷纷自动来作工事与平毁敌人工事。他们亲热的对战士说：“你们要好好保护自己”。
    一切都准备好了，新的行动又告开始。指挥员坚毅的命令：“活捉旅长李昆岗，收复蟠龙镇”。
    又经过一天一夜的激烈战斗，所有山头和工事都被人民解放军占领了，只余西面一个小峁子上的敌人还在绝望的抗拒。黄昏时分，冲锋号响了。人民勇士从东、西、南由各个山头上，以排山倒海之势冲向蟠龙镇。掩护的炮声和机枪火力响成一片，不久战士的呼喊声又盖过了枪炮声。这时候，蟠龙镇上的蒋胡军慌乱极了，他们一群一群的从街上逃进屋里，又从屋里逃向上沟，爬进窑洞，但是马上又从窑洞里爬到街上……………这时候，有十几个人结成一群拚命向北奔逃，解放军某指挥员大喊“抓住他们！”原来这就是旅长李昆岗及其高级指挥人员，他们不敢逃向南面三十华里的青化砭，而选择相距八十里的瓦窑堡。就是这些被俘的高级军官，昨天还依靠它坚固工事顽强抵抗，可是现在只有无可奈何地被活捉了。
    在皎洁的月光下，记者进入破碎了的蟠龙，见到成群结队的戴着宽大皮前沿军帽，穿美式汉奸军服的蒋胡军俘虏，由伙、马夫陪送至解放军营地。千余匹骡马被从各个马房里牵出，驮上了缴获的武器。街上房子里堆着面粉、军服、鞋子、盐和纸烟，蒋胡军九个旅的服装和给养从此都完了。
    蟠龙过去是一个热闹的市镇，如今被蒋介石的魔手迅速毁灭了。全街只见到两个老太婆，他们招呼记者进去喝水，恳切的说：“你们来了就好了！”
