　　Xinhua News Agency, Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Front, 15th. People's guerrilla forces are active in the suburbs of Yan'an. On the night of the 6th, guerrilla forces destroyed more than ten li of highway between San Shi Li Pu and Lao Shan, south of Yan'an. On the 7th, they destroyed four large sections of road, about fifteen li, between Lao Shan and Lin Gou. On the 8th, they destroyed a Chiang-Hu road repair truck at San Shi Li Pu and captured a driver. The guerrilla forces also ambushed between Lao Shan and Yang Zhuang on the morning of the 6th, wiping out 47 Chiang-Kai-shek puppet self-defense soldiers and seizing more than 50 rifles. Currently, transportation on the Yan'an-Ganquan highway has come to a standstill. The Nanniwan Reclamation Area guerrilla forces are tightly blockading the enemy troops in the area towns, covering the people's rush production. In the more than 50 days since the Chiang-Hu troops entered the reclamation area, the guerrilla forces have fought more than 20 large and small battles against the enemy, killing and wounding more than 70 enemy soldiers (including a Hu army battalion commander, a Shaanxi security second battalion commander, and a company commander), and capturing more than 270 prisoners. The weapons, horses, clothing, etc., used by the guerrilla forces have all been resolved from the captured materials. On April 13, the militia of Linzhen District ambushed outside the West Gate of Linzhen, severely attacking more than 200 Chiang-Kai-shek puppet "assault teams" and "self-help teams." Five enemy soldiers were killed or wounded, and no militiamen were injured or killed. The people's guerrilla forces in the suburbs of Wayaobao are also extremely active. On the 7th, more than 100 enemy soldiers went out of the city to plunder and were repelled by more than ten guerrilla fighters.

    【新华社陕北前线十五日电】人民游击队活跃于延安近郊。六日夜游击队在延安南之三十里铺至劳山间，破坏公路十余里。七日在劳山、林沟间又破路四大段约十五里，八日在三十里铺击毁蒋胡之修路汽车一辆，捕获汽车夫一名。游击队并曾于六日上午在劳山、杨庄间设伏，歼蒋伪自卫军四十七名，缴枪五十余枝。现延（安）甘（泉）公路运输已陷于停顿状态。南泥湾垦区游击队正将区镇敌军严密封锁，掩护人民突击生产。自蒋胡军进入垦区迄今之五十余天中，该游击队对敌大小战斗二十余次，毙伤敌七十余名，（内有胡军营长、陕保二大队长、中队长等），生俘二百七十余名。游击队所用之武器、马匹、服装等，都从缴获中得到解决。临镇区民兵于四月十三日埋伏在临镇西门外，痛击蒋伪“突击队”、“自救队”二百余人。毙伤敌五名，民兵无一伤亡。瓦窑堡城郊人民游击队亦极活跃，七日敌百余名出城抢掠，被十多个游击队员击退。
