　　Our Army in the North and South of the Yellow River Coordinate with Each Other
    Re-capture Yangwu and Attack Weishi

    [Xinhua News Agency, Yubei Front, 3rd] The Jilu Yu Local Corps re-recaptured Yangwu County on the 29th of last month, and the results of the battle are still being verified. Our army first recaptured Yangwu on March 38th and then took the initiative to transfer. This is the second time the city has been recaptured.

    [This newspaper, Yuwan Su Front, 14th] (Delayed) A portion of the main force of our Yuwan Su Military Region, in order to coordinate with the offensive launched by our Jinji Lu Yu People's Liberation Army in northern Henan and southern Shanxi, crossed the new Yellow River on the night of the 13th and attacked Weishi County after six hours of fierce fighting. The defending enemies, except for a few who fled, were mostly annihilated. A total of more than 60 enemies were captured alive, and 57 long and short guns, more than 30,000 rounds of ammunition, one radio station, and four telephones were seized. Our task of annihilating the enemy having been accomplished, we immediately withdrew from the city to seek greater opportunities to annihilate the enemy.

    [Special dispatch from this newspaper] In the blocking battles of Baisishan, Yulin, and Cuiping Mountain (all located northwest of Junxian) on the northern Henan front, the Yi character troops of the People's Liberation Army defeated the covering attacks of Chiang's troops with superior forces with fewer troops, fully demonstrating the improvement of the Liberation Army's tactics and combat effectiveness. On the 11th, the Yi character troops first defeated more than 1,000 attacks by Chiang's 124th Brigade on the mountain at the foot of Baisishan at a ratio of one to fifty. Machine gun squad leader Zhang Shuangkou shot down 28 attacking Chiang soldiers with single shots from his machine gun, and combat hero Li Zhixiang hit three enemies with three shots. By the 13th, the Chiang army of the brigade launched another attack on the mountain with 4,000 troops in five routes. Our machine gun shooter Chen Jinlu used one machine gun to repel four Chiang's machine guns. Our platoon of guards repelled the attack of 500 Chiang soldiers. After a day of battle, more than 200 Chiang soldiers were killed or wounded and fled in embarrassment, while our brave defenders had only two battalions. On the 14th, Meng Wenxuan, the second platoon leader of the ninth company of the unit, led eighteen soldiers and repelled four attacks by more than 2,000 Chiang soldiers on Naishantou in one day. The Chiang army attacked from the south, southeast, and southwest. Our defending soldiers calmly resisted. When the enemy advanced to 20 meters away from the position, platoon leader Meng Wenxuan gave an order to "fire", first repelling the Chiang army on the south route, and then turning to the sides to repel the enemies attacking on the southwest and southeast routes. On the same day, Xu Jinwang, the deputy company commander of the sixth company of the unit, led 20 soldiers to block the Chiang army invading Daxiaoyulin and fought with the Chiang army for two days and three nights. In the blocking battle of Cuiping Mountain on the 15th, the two battalions of the unit defeated two attacks by Chiang's 199th Brigade, killing and wounding more than 300 Chiang soldiers, creating a brilliant example of a ratio of one to one hundred. In this battle, soldier Gao Tianze single-handedly blocked a company of attacking enemies, defended the position for half an hour, and killed more than ten enemies. Zeng Xiankun, an eighteen-year-old artilleryman, repelled the charge of hundreds of Chiang soldiers with seven shells. The five-day blocking battle fully demonstrated the greater improvement of the People's Liberation Army's tactics and combat effectiveness, while the Chiang army showed more panic. Although they carried out fierce artillery bombardment and were covered by aircraft before each attack, they lay on the ground and dared not advance when they advanced to 50 meters away from our position, which shows the general low morale of the Chiang army.

　　黄河南北我军相互策应
    再克阳武袭入尉氏
    【新华社豫北前线三日电】冀鲁豫地方兵团于上月二十九日再度收复阳武县城，战果正清查中。按我军于三月三十八日第一次收复阳武后，即主动转移，此为第二次收复该城。
    【本报豫皖苏前线十四日电】（迟到）我豫皖苏军区主力一部，为配合我晋冀鲁豫人民解放军在豫北、晋南所发动的攻势，乃于十三日夜渡过新黄河，以六小时激战袭入尉氏县城。守敌除少数逃窜外，大部就歼。计生俘敌六十余名，缴长短枪五十七枝，子弹三万余发，电台一部，电话机四部。我以歼灭敌人之任务已经达成，当即撤出该城，以寻找更大之歼敌机会。
    【本报特讯】豫北前线白寺山、榆林、翠屏山（均在浚县西北）等阻击战中，人民解放军毅字部队均以少胜多，击退蒋军以优势兵力的掩护进攻，充分显示出解放军战术与战斗力的提高。十一日，我毅字部队首在白寺山麓以一与五十之比，击退蒋军一二四旅千余对该山之两次进攻，机枪班长张双科以机枪单发打倒二十八个冲锋蒋军，战斗英雄李芝香三枪中三敌。至十三日，该旅蒋军复以四千之众分五路向该山再次进攻，我机枪射手陈金录，他用一挺机枪击退蒋军四挺机枪，我以一排守卫战士击退五百蒋军之进攻。经一日战斗，蒋军被毙伤二百余，狼狈窜回，而我固守勇士仅两个营。十四日，该部九连二排长孟文轩，带十八个战士一日内击退二千余蒋军对奶山头的四次进攻。蒋军从正南、东南、西南三面进攻，我守卫战士沉着抗击，待敌进至距阵地二十米远处，排长孟文轩一声“开火”，首先将正南一路蒋军击溃，后又转至两侧将西南、东南两路冲锋之敌击退。同日该部六连副连长徐金旺率领二十名战士阻击向大小榆林进犯之蒋军与蒋军周旋二天三夜。十五日翠屏山阻击战中，该部两个营击溃蒋军一九九旅之两路进攻，毙伤蒋军三百余，更创下一与一百之比的光辉战例。此次战斗中，战士高天泽单身阻击一连进攻之敌，固守阵地半小时，毙敌十人以上。十八岁小炮手曾现琨七发炮弹打退百余蒋军的冲锋。五日的阻击战中，充分显示出人民解放军战术与战斗力的更加提高，而蒋军则愈加表现恐慌，虽然每次进攻前均先实行猛烈的炮轰并由飞机掩护，但冲锋时进至距我阵地五十米远处，即伏地不敢前进，由此可见蒋军士气低落之一般。（乃一、勇进）
