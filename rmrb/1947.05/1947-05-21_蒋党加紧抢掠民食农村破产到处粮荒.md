    Beiping dispatch: Citizens of Beiping and Tianjin line up daily to buy grain, and sighs are heard everywhere. Local newspapers unanimously believe that this serious famine was caused by the Chiang army's exhaustive levies and exploitation. Now the Chiang government authorities are planning to purchase 50,000 tons of coarse grains from the Northeast to alleviate the emergency, but according to people from the Northeast, this move is bound to be futile. Because the grain panic that is generally occurring in the Chiang-occupied areas of the Northeast is no less severe than in the Chiang-occupied areas within the customs. The Northeast has always been abundant in grain production, especially in northern Manchuria, but now most of northern Manchuria is in the liberated areas. Because rice prices in Beiping have risen too sharply, citizens say, "Rice prices and banknotes are soaring together, and the people can only eat vegetables."

    Shanghai dispatch: In order to save its grain shortage crisis, the Chiang government is frantically intensifying grain requisition. The "Grain Requisition Supervision Groups" of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan and Kangxi, which are responsible for plundering grain from the people, were formed and distributed to various places as early as the beginning of March when the wheat seedlings were less than a foot tall. The Chiang government also ordered that "hereafter, the detention of people due to grain requisition shall not be restricted by law." According to the Dagong Bao on April 26, the Chiang government has levied another 2.34 million dan of military grain in Jiangxi Province. From 1941 to 1946, the province had been levied 70 million dan of grain, accounting for one-fifth of the annual output. Last year, the Chiang government forced the "purchase" of 2 million dan of military grain, and the grain official Cheng Maoxing, director of the Jiangxi Provincial Land Management Office, was forced to die. This year, there has been no harvest, but the requisition order has been reissued. The newspaper also said: "If this continues, the rural economy will collapse and be irreparable."

    Shanghai report: The rural economy in Jiangnan, which is known as the land of fish and rice, has been completely bankrupted under the heavy oppression of donations, taxes, and rents by the Chiang government. Farmers in the area can usually produce two and a half dan of rice per mu of paddy field, but after paying rent and other miscellaneous expenses, they only receive six or seven dou. Farmers have nothing to eat, forcing young people to flee to Shanghai or other cities to make a living, and only the old, weak, women and children are left in the countryside, which is very tragic. But the Chiang government is extremely cruel to the surviving farmers. Tang Huisheng, a farmer in Guoxiang, Suzhou, was subjected to water torture by the so-called "Tenancy Mediation and Enforcement Office" because he could not afford to pay the rent. When he was escorted to Suzhou on the 30th of last month, he died with blood flowing from his ears and nose.

　　蒋党加紧抢掠民食农村破产到处粮荒
    【新华社陕北十八日电】北平讯：平津市民每日排队购粮，到处一片叹息声。此间报纸一致认为：此次严重粮荒，是蒋军穷征极剥所造成。现蒋政府当局又图从东北购杂粮五万吨救急，但据东北来人谈，此举势必徒劳无功。因目前东北蒋占区普遍发生之粮食恐慌，并不比关内蒋占区为轻。东北产粮向以北满为丰，现北满大部又为解放区。平市因米价涨风太甚，市民汉谓：“米价与大钞齐飞，民容共蔬菜一色。”
    【新华社陕北十八日电】沪讯：蒋政府为挽救其粮荒危机，正疯狂加紧征粮。江浙皖赣湘鄂川康等四个抢劫民粮之“征粮督导团”于三月初麦苗尚不满尺时已组成分发各地。蒋政府且下令“嗣后因征粮而扣押人民不受法律限制。”据四月二十六日大公报载称：蒋政府又在江西省苛征军粮二百三十四万担。该省于民国三十年至三十五年间，曾被征粮七千万担，占年产量五分之一。去年蒋政府因强迫“采购”二百万担军粮，并把粮官赣省田管处处长程懋型逼死，今年秋毫未收，而征令已重。该报并称：“如此下去，农村经济势将土崩瓦解，而不可收拾。”
    【新华社陕北十八日电】沪报讯：素称鱼米之乡的江南，在蒋政府捐税苛虐，地租沉重压迫下，农村经济完全破产。该地农民耕种一亩田稻，普通可产米两担半，但付出地租及其他苛杂后，实收只剩六七斗；农民无以为食，迫使青年纷纷逃往上海或其他城市谋生，乡村仅留老弱妇孺，状甚悲惨。但蒋政府对苟延残喘的农民，极尽惨酷；苏州郭巷农民汤惠生，因无力缴租，竟被所谓“佃租调解执行处”施以灌水毒刑。至上月三十日被押至苏州时，耳鼻流鲜血而死。
