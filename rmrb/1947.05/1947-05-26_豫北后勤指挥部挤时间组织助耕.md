　　The Yubei Logistics Command Squeezes Time to Organize Aid to Agriculture
    [Report from this newspaper, Yubei] On the evening of the 16th of this month, the Logistics Command held a meeting at its station for all personnel to assist in agricultural work. Vice Commander Lu Ruilin pointed out in his speech: Production is as important as war. Everyone must step up their work and squeeze out as much time as possible to help the masses plant cotton. Plant one more mu, gain one more strength. After the meeting, various departments discussed the matter separately. In the past, the communications platoon was too busy with fifty people, but after discussion, a system was established, routes were designated, and only ten people were left to maintain operations each day. The guard platoon left three people to take turns on sentry duty during the day, and each department left a small number of cadres to maintain operations. A total of seventy-two people were drawn out to help the masses with production. Everyone's morale is high, and action has already begun with great fanfare.

　　豫北后勤指挥部挤时间组织助耕
    【本报豫北讯】后勤指挥部于本月十六日晚，于驻地召开本单位全体人员助耕大会。鲁瑞林副司令员在讲话中指出：生产和战争同样的重要，大家要加紧工作，尽量挤出时间，来帮助群众播种棉花，多种一亩，多增一分力量。会后各部门分别讨论；通讯排过去五十个人忙不过来，经讨论后，确定制度，划定路线，每天只留十个人坚持工作；警卫排白天留三个人轮流站岗，各部门中留少数干部，坚持工作，计共抽出七十二人去帮助群众生产。大家的情绪很高，现已轰轰烈烈地行动起来了。
