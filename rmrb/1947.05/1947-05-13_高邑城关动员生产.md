　　Gao Yi City Mobilizes Production
    [Reported by our Gao Yi correspondent] After the emancipation movement, the more than ten thousand residents of Gao Yi City each received an average of four mu of land. On the 28th of last month, a meeting of 470 cadres and activists was held to mobilize production. The first task was to resolve the issues left over from last year's mutual aid efforts. Last year, in order to rush the wheat planting, the city organized all labor and animal power in the city, including merchants, women, children, and all able-bodied people, working day and night to operate waterwheels. Although wages were stipulated at the time, everyone broke up due to the emancipation movement and the accounts were never settled. Some people with labor and livestock worked hard for a period, but their own wheat was not planted. The merchants' work on the waterwheels was also wasted, which affected this year's organization. In addition to reviewing last year's mistakes, the leadership also guaranteed that they would not repeat last year's path this year. As a result, the masses at the meeting discussed, "Many hands make light work. As the saying goes, a hoe is afraid of three people, and an ox is afraid of two yokes. Mutual aid has its benefits, but it must be fair." Then, they promoted speaking frankly, and many people revealed their inner problems, thus resolving many knots and laying a good foundation for further developing mutual aid. For example, Wang Mang said, "I get a headache when I hear about mutual aid. This year, I thought about it and was afraid people would say I was backward if I didn't participate. Later, I organized a support group with several households, specializing in supporting the superiors, but actually not engaging in mutual aid." After being praised by the leadership, many people told the truth. Some people's "cutting chives" mentality was also resolved in the process of telling the truth. After the mobilization meeting, the masses were very enthusiastic about production. At the end of the meeting, each district issued challenges to each other, aiming to compete before the Grain in Ear season.

　　高邑城关动员生产
    【本报高邑讯】高邑城关万余市民，经翻身运动后每人平均取得土地四亩。上月二十八日开了四百七十人的干部积极分子会动员生产。首先是解决去年互助留下的圪塔；去年城关为了突击种麦，把全城关大、中、小商妇女儿童一切劳力畜力完全编制起来，连明带夜的推水车，当时虽也规定工资，但因后来大家闹翻身也没算账就散了，有些有劳力有牲口的，突击忙了一个时期，可是自己的麦子没有种上。商人们推水车也就算白推了，因此影响了今年的组织起来。领导上除检讨去年错误外，同时保证今年再不走去年的道路。这样一来到会的群众纷纷议论说：“人多力量大，常说锄怕三张牛怕二犋，互助起来沾是沾，就是得闹公道。”接着又提倡说心话，许多人谈出来自己的心病，因此有很多解不开的圪塔解开了，给进一步发展互助打了下好的基础。如王忙说：“我一听互助，就脑袋痛，今年我想了一顿，不参加怕人说落后，后来我与几户组织了一个支应组，专门支应上级，实际不互助。”经过领导上的表扬，许多人都说了老实话。有些人的割韭菜思想也在说老实话中得到解决。经过动员会，群众对生产的热情很高。散会时各关互相下了挑战书，要在芒种以前比高低。
