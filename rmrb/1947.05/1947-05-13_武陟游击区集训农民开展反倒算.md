　　[Reported from Wuzhi] To more effectively carry out the anti-land redistribution movement, the Fourth District convened a training class for farmer association members and those whose land had been redistributed on April 26th in a guerrilla environment. Approximately 150 people from more than ten villages including Mozhuang attended. At the beginning of the meeting, most people wore bitter expressions, sighed deeply, and remained silent. Even when they spoke, they would say things like, "I've died several deaths," and, "Alas! Let them (referring to special agents, local bullies, and landlords) do what they want! Arguing with them is pointless." After a report on the current situation and speeches by activists, the mood slightly shifted. Some said, "This can be considered a breath of fresh air (referring to news of victories), and I feel a little more relieved. However, good is good, but things here aren't that great yet." Under this circumstance, the leadership emphasized: "The present good situation is the result of several months of hard work. Is it better for everyone to stand up tall or to lie down and not get up?" After this mobilization, the masses asked, "Is it lenient or not?" and "Will we go back to the mountains or not?" Everyone showed that they were ready to act. They unanimously agreed to not go home that night and continue the meeting the next day. The next day, even more people attended than the first day. The leadership organized some exemplary speeches from the activists discovered on the first day and the members of the armed work team (mainly focusing on the positive aspects of the masses), which inspired the masses' enthusiasm. Everyone said, "Now they (enemies) don't dare to act openly, so they act secretly." Some said, "You've already died several deaths by not acting, and worrying without acting is also concerning." After that, it's enough to catch those who are not lenient. Wasn't the capture of Liu Shengyou (a major local bully) done by our core members (old farmer association members)? We have to learn from them to relieve our hatred." By the time the meeting adjourned in the late afternoon, the general mood was quite high, and smiles replaced the previously worried expressions.
　　When addressing the ideological concerns about "going back to the mountains or not," in addition to explaining the changes in the overall situation, a correct analysis should be made of the situation and reasons for going to the mountains. Particular emphasis should be placed on the fact that the work had not been done well, and everyone had not yet united into a "hornet's nest" or "iron lump," and did not know how to wage guerrilla warfare. But today, there is already experience in guerrilla warfare. Experience proves that as long as everyone raises their heads again, works harder, and unites as one, success will be achieved, further indicating that there will be no more going back to the mountains.
　　When addressing the ideological problem of "leniency or not," some self-criticism and explanations were combined with the actual situation, so that everyone understood that we are lenient towards those who were coerced and have decided to reform. We will never be lenient towards those who have committed heinous crimes and are only paying lip service to changing their ways, those who are die-hard elements. Those who have killed must pay with their lives, and the government will avenge the victims and give vent to their anger. In this way, everyone's ideological concerns were resolved. Now everyone is working with great energy and high morale.

　　武陟游击区集训农民开展反倒算
    【本报武陟讯】四区为了更有力的开展反倒算运动，乃于四月二十六日在游击环境中召开了农会会员与被倒算之群众训练班，到磨庄等十余村庄约一百五十余人。会议开始时大部分都是面带苦容、长吁短叹，不发言，即或发言，也是说些死了几死，唉！叫人家干吧！弄不住人家（指特务恶霸地主），说说也是白说。经过时事报告积极分子已发言，大家情绪稍有转变，有的便说：“这也总算出了口气（指胜利消息），心里还舒展些。可是，好是好，咱们这里还不算太好。”领导上在这情况下着重强调：现在的好，是几个月努力干出来的，大家是抬头站起来好呢？还是躺着不起来好？经过这一动员，群众又提出：“宽大不宽大”？“还上山不上山”？大家显示出要准备干。当天晚上不回家，明天继续开会，得到大家一致同意。第二天人比头一天人又增加些。领导上组织些头天发现的积极分子和武工队员的典型发言（主要是群众的积极面），启发了群众的干劲，大家说：“现在明的不敢干要暗干。”有的说：“你不干已经死了几死了，死了不干也是担心。”以后捉住不宽大就行，捉住刘生有（大恶霸）还不是咱们那几个基本人（老农会员）干的，咱们也得学他们解解心头恨。”半下午散会时，一般情绪颇高，一扫愁眉不展而成笑容。
    解决“还上山不上山这一思想顾虑时，除了说明整个形势变化外，应正确分析上山的情况与原因，特别强调了工作没有作好，大家还没有团结成“蚂蜂窝”“铁圪塔”，不会打游击等，而今天在打游击上已有经验。实验证明：只要大家重新抬起头来，更加努力团结一致，干就中，更表明今后再不上山。
    解决“宽大不宽大”的思想问题，结合实际作了些自我批评和解释，使大家了解了我们宽大的是胁从分子，并已决心改过者，对罪大恶极只是口头坦白转变的死心分子，决不宽大，杀人者一定得抵命，政府一定给被害者报仇出气。这样大家的思想顾虑才得到解决，现在大家干的劲很大，情绪也很高。
