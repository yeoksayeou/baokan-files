　　Combat Hero Squad of the Sacred Character Unit
    Valiant and Swift in Action, Resolutely Executing Missions
    Demonstrating High Degree of Class Fraternalism in Combat
    [Report from the Yubei Front, May 5th] In the Laotian'an (near the Yellow River Iron Bridge) battle of the Yubei Campaign, the Second Squad of the Eighth Company of the Sacred Character Unit had seven of its nine members selected as combat heroes. The unit specially commended them, awarding them a prize banner and the title of "Combat Hero Squad." The commendation order pointed out that the squad was valiant and swift in action during the battle, with six members wounded but refusing to leave the front line, resolutely executing their mission to break through the enemy's forward positions, and demonstrating a high degree of class fraternalism in combat. The squad was the assault squad in the Laotian'an battle. After the battle began, under intense enemy fire, the squad used a sudden movement to pounce on the enemy's field fortifications and enter the forward trench. Squad leader Zhang Zongbao was wounded in the head, but without bothering with bandaging, he led the entire squad across the second trench and into the village. During the battle, when the enemy was changing machine gun magazines, soldier Guo Yicai leaped forward and seized the machine gun. Mutual aid group leaders Ye Renying and Wang Fushan, and soldier Li Haiqing, discovered that the enemy's heavy machine gun in a bunker to the north was blocking our advancing troops. They crawled to within five or six meters of the enemy, and three rifles were aimed at the enemy's gun port, effectively suppressing the enemy's fire. Soldier Gai You charged into a house alone, and after being wounded, fought with more than ten enemies armed with submachine guns using hand grenades, driving the enemy into a series of rooms. First mutual aid group leader Xiao Chaowen and deputy squad leader Chao Yuejian went into the house to rescue Gai You, and were wounded in the head and neck, but insisted on staying in the fight, saying, "We will not leave until we have eliminated the enemy and rescued Gai You!" After the platoon leader arrived with other soldiers, Xiao Chaowen charged into the house with them, eliminating all the enemies, carrying out the immobile Gai You, and seizing two British-style rifles and one submachine gun from the enemy.
