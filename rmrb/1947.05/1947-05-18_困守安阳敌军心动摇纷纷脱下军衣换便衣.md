　　[Reported from the front lines of northern Henan, May 17th] Following the liberation of Tangyin, the Chiang troops in Anyang are gripped by extreme panic. According to Zhang Zicai, a first-class private from the small artillery platoon of the 316th Regiment of the Chiang army who escaped from Anyang: Li Zhenqing, the commander of the 40th Division of the Chiang army in Anyang, has recently been lecturing his officers, forbidding his subordinates from discussing the loss of Tangyin and the capture of Sun Dianying alive, only allowing them to talk about "the National Army's occupation of Yan'an." However, the soldiers are spreading the saying, "Victory is talked about every day, but defeats are fought every time." Some soldiers even deliberately ask their superiors: "How is Tangyin? Where did Chief Sun (Sun Dianying) go?" Even more ridiculous, Chiang army officers are deceiving their soldiers by saying: "The Eighth Route Army's cannons and machine guns are made of wood and dough, just used as props to scare people." But the soldiers do not believe this shameful deception. Soldiers are anxiously trying to establish relationships with merchants in the city, looking for civilian clothes to prepare for escape. Pang Deqing (son of Pang Bingxun), the commander of the 613th Regiment of the Chiang army, took off his officer's uniform and put on a soldier's uniform after flying from Xinxiang to Anyang a few days ago. Other officers have followed suit, preparing to become prisoners of the People's Liberation Army. The soldier also said: "Chiang Kai-shek, fearing that his officers would lay down their arms, has already transported their families to Xinxiang and other places by plane."

　　[Reported from the front lines of northern Henan, May 16th] Frontline reporter Wu Xiang reported: The Chiang and puppet troops in Anyang and the "government-in-exile," "homecoming corps," local bullies, and secret agents in the surrounding twenty-odd counties are in extreme panic and unease. The "homecoming corps" mostly retreated to the towns and cities, but they are not receiving supplies. The 40th Division of the Chiang army, under the pretext of insufficient troops, has reorganized them into the army, causing great dissatisfaction among the "homecoming corps," and many people have buried or sold their guns. The Chiang army has densely deployed strongholds and bunkers around the outskirts of the towns and cities, and is stepping up construction day and night. Clerks, students, merchants, and fleeing landlords are all, without exception, being forced to serve as laborers. Currently, firewood has risen to 3 catties per thousand yuan, grass to 2 catties per thousand yuan, and salt to more than 20 yuan per catty. Grain has no fixed price, only beef and donkey meat are relatively cheap, because fleeing landlords can no longer afford to feed their livestock and are killing them to sell the meat. The order in the city is extremely chaotic, and the Chiang army is taking the opportunity to fish in troubled waters, with several cases of robbery and rape occurring every day. On the morning of the 11th, 300-odd "laborers" escaped from Sanlitun, Nanguan. They were all old people from nearby villages who had been forced to build fortifications. The Chiang army gave them a bowl of thin porridge, and anyone who dug slowly was beaten with a rifle butt. When they fled, the Chiang army opened fire in pursuit but was repelled by the People's Liberation Army.

　　困守安阳敌军心动摇纷纷脱下军衣换便衣
    【本报豫北前线十七日电】汤阴为我解放后，安阳蒋军恐慌万状。据安阳逃出之蒋军三一六团小炮排一等兵张自才称：安阳城内蒋军四十师师长李振清，近来常向其军官训话，不准部下讲汤阴失守、孙殿英被活捉的消息，只准讲“国军进占延安”。但士兵中却流行着“胜利天天讲，败仗回回打。”有的士兵更故意问其长官：“汤阴怎么样？孙长官（孙殿英）上那里去了？”更可笑的，是蒋军官欺骗其士兵说：“八路军的炮和机枪都是木头和面做的，只是用来做样子吓人的。”但士兵们都不相信这种可耻的欺骗。士兵慌着和城内商民拉关系，找便衣准备逃跑。蒋军六一三团团长庞德庆（庞炳勋之子），日前由新乡飞安阳后，即脱去军官服装，换上士兵军服。其他军官纷纷效尤，准备做人民解放军的俘虏。该士兵又称：“蒋介石恐其军官放下武器，已将他们的家属用飞机押运新乡等地”。
                                                 （勇进）
    【本报豫北前线十六日电】前线记者吴象报导：安阳蒋伪军及附近二十余县之“流亡政府”、“还乡团”、恶霸、特务陷于极度恐慌不安中。“还乡团”多缩回城关和城内，但是得不到给养。蒋军四十师借口兵员不足，将其改编入伍，引起“还乡团”极大不满，不少人已把枪埋藏或卖掉。蒋军在城关外围密布据点碉堡，日夜加修工事，职员、学生、商人、逃亡地主，都毫无例外地被抓去当夫。现烧柴已涨至每千元三斤，草一千元二斤，盐两十余元一斤。粮食已无定价，只有牛肉驴肉比较便宜，因为逃亡地主已喂不起牲口，纷纷杀了卖肉。城内秩序混乱异常，蒋军乘机混水摸鱼，抢劫奸淫案件日必数起，十一日上午，由南关三里屯逃出“民夫”三百余，都是附近各村抓去修工事的老百姓，蒋军给他们一顿稀饭，谁挖慢了就用枪托乱打。他们逃跑时，蒋军开枪尾追，被人民解放军击退。
