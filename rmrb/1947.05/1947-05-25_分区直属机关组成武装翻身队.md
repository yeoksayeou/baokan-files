　　Partition Directly Subordinate Organs Form Armed Turn-Over Team
　　[Another dispatch] The directly subordinate organs of the partition and the Lingchuan militia have jointly formed an armed turn-over team, which will go to various counties to help peasants turn over. On May 13th, Comrade Liu Yi, secretary of the Taihang Fourth District Committee, first explained the task of the turn-over team at the send-off meeting, and gave five points of instruction on the work: First, we must use our own determination and courage to firm up the masses, and then we can talk about boldly mobilizing the masses. Second, we must take root well, and we must grasp the complete class line of mobilizing the poor and hired peasants, uniting the middle peasants, and eliminating feudalism. Third, the leadership method must be the mass line, we must carefully and patiently feel the thoughts of the masses (especially the poor peasants), and we must boldly believe in and use activists to carry out the work. Fourth, pay attention to the issue of distributing the fruits, and be sure to let the poor and hired peasants thoroughly turn over. Fifth, pay attention to organizational construction, and be sure to put the power and armed forces in the hands of the poor and hired peasants. Repeated bloody experience has taught us that no matter what the incident, it was not caused by internal causes, but the peasant association should be broadened. The comrades of the various organs participating in the turn-over team are working hard to study these instructions, and are discussing making meritorious preparations and discipline issues, preparing to go down and do it well and make great contributions!

　　[Report from our newspaper in Huojia] On the evening of May 5th, our Huojia Wukung Team, combined with a part of the Wuzhi guerrilla team, raided Chengfeng, the center of the Chiang army's occupied area between Xinxiang Yellow River Bridge, Wuzhi, and Xiuwu. Without firing a single shot, they immediately ascended the village. More than 20 traitors and despots and pseudo-personnel were captured, and no one on the pre-captured list of traitors and despots escaped. All thirteen guns of the pseudo-self-defense corps were also seized by us. A few extremely evil traitors and despots were executed on the spot after public announcement, and most were educated and allowed to be released on bail. At the same time, a two-hour propaganda activity was carried out, posting notices, propaganda materials, and conducting door-to-door visits to publicize grievances. The people's hearts were encouraged, and the enemy and puppets were shocked. The surrounding villages contacted our democratic government one after another, saying in unison: Old Chiang is not working, the rear is empty, and they demand that our army enter the activities and re-liberate them from the abyss of misery and recover the lost land.

　　分区直属机关组成武装翻身队
    【又讯】分区直属机关和陵川民兵合组武装翻身队，将分赴各县帮助农民翻身，五月十三日太行四地委书记刘毅同志在欢送会上首先说明翻身队的任务，在工作上指示了五点意见：一、要以自己的坚决勇敢来坚定群众，而后才能谈到大胆放手发动群众。二、要把根扎好，要掌握住发动贫雇，团结中农，消灭封建的完整的阶级路线。三、领导方法一定要是群众路线的，要细心耐心的摸群众（特别是贫农）的心思，要大胆的相信和运用积极分子开展工作。四、注意分果实的问题，一定要让贫雇彻底翻身。五、要注意组织建设，一定要把政权和武装掌握在贫雇农民手里，多次血的经验教训了我们，不论那次事件，没有不是由内因造成的，但农会要放宽些。参加翻身队各机关的同志们，正在努力研究这些指示，并讨论立功准备和纪律问题，准备下去干，好立大功！

    【本报获嘉讯】五月五日晚，我获嘉武工队结合武陟游击队一部，奔袭新乡黄河桥、武陟、修武之间，蒋军侵占区中心程封。一枪未发，即行登寨。捕捉二十余名奸霸伪人员，所有预捉名单上之奸霸，无一漏网。伪自卫团共十三支枪，亦全部被我缴获。个别罪大恶极之奸霸，当场布告处决，大部教育后，准予取保释放。同时，开展了二小时宣传活动，张贴布告、宣传品，并进行挨户访苦宣传工作。人心振奋，敌伪震惊，周围村庄纷纷向我民主政府接头，一致说：老蒋不行了，后方空虚，要求我军进入活动，重新解放他们于水深火热之中，收复失地。
