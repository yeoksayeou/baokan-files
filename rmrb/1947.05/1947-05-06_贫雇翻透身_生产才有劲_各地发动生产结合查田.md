　　Poor and Hired Peasants Thoroughly Liberated, Production Gains Momentum
    Various Regions Launch Production Combined with Land Investigation
    [Our Newspaper's Report] In Baichan Village, She County, cadres and the masses felt the shortage of labor during the busy period of participating in the war effort this spring, and the cadres did not lead the work, so production did not start. On the 10th of last month, when the cadres were mobilized in the village to first mobilize the poor and hired peasants for production, the masses reflected: "We are willing to produce, but we have no food to eat. Last winter, the struggle against the major targets was treated as minor targets. When we should have struggled, we just had discussions. We don't understand what's going on." In one day, it was discovered that seven households had no food to eat and could not produce (all of whom returned from Shanxi last winter), completely relying on doing odd jobs for others to survive. Last year, of the nineteen landlords who were struggled against, six were despots and landlords who were not thoroughly struggled against, and nine who should have been struggled against just had discussions. Furthermore, from the average amount of land held by each class after the land reform, it can be seen that landlords and rich peasants still have more land and grain production than poor peasants (landlords averaged 1.3 *shi* of grain per person; poor peasants 0.8 or 0.9 *dou*). It was decided to continue the review, conduct education, and unite for large-scale production. Individual mobilization was carried out, followed by organized discussions. In one day of discussion, 68 unflipped farmers and honest peasants (men) and 57 (women) who did not speak up were identified. Niu Tongji, a peasant who had been liberated, said: "There are four minds in our village: the landlords have one mind, the middle peasants have one mind, we who have been liberated have one mind, and those who have not been liberated have another mind. This is like 'stone chickens climbing the south slope, each minding their own business.' How can we unite?" After clarifying this issue, classes were divided, targets were clarified, and after four dark nights of deliberation and discussion, eighteen households were struggled against on the 15th and 16th, using a method of struggling against them in batches and resolving problems on a small scale.
    In the struggle, ideological education was combined to clarify "who are our own people." The minds of the middle and poor peasants were opened up, and they expressed their attitudes to each other. The middle peasants said, "Let the poor peasants get the fruits." The extremely poor peasants said, "We can't liberate ourselves by relying on ourselves alone." The middle and poor peasants united, and everyone actively engaged in production.
    [Our Newspaper's Report from Huguan] Zhao Village conducted land investigation during production to completely fill the "hole" households. The land investigation revealed that although the masses had been liberated in terms of land quantity, there were still some problems in terms of land quality. Poor peasant Guo Qishu was farming 2.2 *mu* of land alone, and according to the expected yield, he should have harvested 3.6 *shi*, which is still acceptable given his single-person situation. He is already eighteen years old this year, and soon another marriage will create another "hole." Poor peasant Guo Fujin's family of four had 6.1 *mu* of land, yielding 7.2 *shi* of grain. Destitute peasant Guo Laocang's family of three farmed 4.8 *mu* of land, yielding 6.6 *shi* of grain. Military dependent Guo Chengshan's family of three farmed 5.3 *mu* of land, with an expected yield of 6.9 *shi*. According to the above households, neither the yield nor the quality is sufficient; however, landlords still average 1.2 *mu* of land per person. The operating landlords averaged 2 *mu*, and the quality of their land was even better than that of the peasants. Based on this situation, the leadership, under the guiding principle of production as the primary task, worked on the land during the day and held meetings at night to solve the remaining problems in the land investigation. The masses mobilized the landlords to return their debts voluntarily with the slogan "Debts must be paid off completely, leaving no future troubles." The cadres discovered the problems of "hole" households from the plan of ordering "three out of ten" (耕三余一), and finally carried out a new allocation. One landlord, two operating landlords, and one rich peasant contributed 12.4 *mu* of good land, filling the "holes" of eight households (five poor peasant households and three lower-middle peasant households), so that the "hole" households received appropriate solutions in terms of both the quantity and quality of land. (Liang Yu)
    [Our Newspaper's Report from Taiyue, 4th] Shimin Sixth District combined review with production to thoroughly resolve legacy issues and promote the production movement. Their experience: First, relatively large problems were resolved by drawing out morning or noon time after the mutual aid teams had matured, such as the problem of Wang Jiaxu, a small landlord in Beigou, which was resolved in one morning by the two relevant mutual aid teams. After the resolution, someone was sent to take the fruits, and the others went back to production. Second, small problems were solved by calling the targets of struggle to the mutual aid team during rest or evening time, allowing the masses to express their opinions and calculate the fruits to be returned. The problem of Guo Shuhai in Jiaofang Village was solved in this way. Now the district has completed the review work, and the peasants have gained another 248 *mu* of land, 128 *shi* of grain, and 28 head of livestock, providing sufficient compensation for the unflipped poor households. At the same time, in order to dispel the concerns of individual peasants about getting rich, they also resolutely compensated the middle peasants who had been harmed, which improved the peasants' enthusiasm for production. In Wangbi Village, elderly people in their fifties carried manure like young people, and Hou Meili and Hou Meiqing, who had never worked in the past, also joined the mutual aid, and 95% of the full and semi-labor force in the village has been organized. Tian Limei, a former rich peasant in Huojiashan, also happily joined the mutual aid team after the feudal vestiges were cut off during the review, working from early morning to late night with great enthusiasm.

　　贫雇翻透身  生产才有劲
    各地发动生产结合查田
    【本报讯】涉县白芟村在今春参战差务繁忙中干部群众都感到劳力缺，干部也没去领导，所以生产就没动。上月十号在村里动员了干部要先发动贫雇生产，听到群众反映是：“咱愿意生产就是没粮食吃，去冬斗争大对象当成小对象，该斗争就座谈了，咱不清楚是怎样一回事。”一天即发现七户没粮食吃不能生产（都是去冬从山西回来的），完全靠着给人家做活维持生活，去年斗了地主十九户就有六个恶霸、地主未斗透，九户该斗争就座谈了。又从土地改革后各阶层土地平均数来看，亦是地主、富农还保有土地和产粮多于贫农（地主平均每人产粮一石三；贫农八九斗）。便决定继续复查，进行教育，团结大生产。进行个别发动，再到组织讨论，讨论中一天即找出没翻身户及不说话的老实农民男六十八个、女五十七个，翻了身的农民牛同吉说：“咱村有四条心，地主一个心思，中农一个心思，咱翻了身的一个心思，没翻身的又一个心思，这是“石鸡上南坡各顾各”，怎能团结哩。”明确了这个问题后，划分阶级，明确对象，经过四黑夜酝酿讨论在十五、十六两天即斗争了十八户，是分片斗争与小型解决问题的方法。
    在斗争中结合进行了思想教育，明确：“谁是自己人”，中贫农思想扯通了，互相表明态度，中农说：“让贫农得果实”。赤贫农说：“光靠我们翻不了身。”中贫农团结了，大家积极闹生产。
    【本报壶关讯】赵村生产中查田，彻底填平窟窿户。查田中发现：从地量上看来群众都翻了身，但从地质上看来还有些问题。贫农郭起书一人种着二亩二分地，按应产量才收三石六斗，以一人的光景来看还是可以，他今年已十八岁了，不久再结一个婚就又是一个窟窿。贫农郭福金四口人，六亩一分地，收粮食七石二斗。赤贫郭老仓三人种地四亩八分。收粮六石六斗。军属郭成山三人种地五亩三分，应产量六石九斗。据以上的几户看来，无论从产量和质量都不够；但是地主每人还平均土地一亩二分。经营地主，平均二亩，比起农民的地质还好。领导上依据这种情形在生产为主的方针下，白天上地，黑夜开会解决查田中的遗留问题。群众对地主是以“账要还清，不留祸根”的口号，动员他们自动还账，干部对群众是从订耕三余一的计划里，发现窟窿户问题，最后进行了新的割补。一户地主、两户经营地主、一户富农，献出好地十二亩四分，填了八户窟窿（贫农五户、下中农三户），使窟窿户在土地的数量与质量上，都得到了适当解决。（良玉）
    【本报太岳四日电】士敏六区在生产中结合复查，彻底解决遗留问题，推进生产运动。其经验：第一、比较大的问题，经互助组酝酿成熟后，抽出早晨或晌午时间解决，如北沟小地主王家绪的问题，便是在一个早上，由有关的二个互助组来解决，解决后派人去拿果实，别人都回去生产。第二、小问题利用休息或晚上时间，把斗争对象叫到互助组来，让群众提意见，算出应退的果实；教坊村郭书海的问题，就是这样解决的。现该区已完成复查工作，农民又获得土地二百四十八亩，粮食一百二十八石，耕畜二十八头，使未翻透身贫户得到充足填补。同时为解除个别农民怕发财顾虑，又坚决进行补偿被损害的中农，提高了农民的生产情绪。王璧村五十多岁的老人和年青人一样担粪，过去从不劳动的侯美礼、侯美卿也参加互助，该村全半劳力百分之九十五已组织起来。霍家山旧富农田礼美，自复查割去封建尾巴后，也愉快的参加互助组，起早搭黑劳动，情绪很高。
