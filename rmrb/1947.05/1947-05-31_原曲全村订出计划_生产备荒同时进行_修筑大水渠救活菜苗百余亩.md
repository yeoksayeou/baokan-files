[Reported by this newspaper from Shexian] The mobilization for production and famine preparation in Yuanqu Village, Fifth District, was proposed during the mass transportation of grain by all male full and semi-laborers and some women in the village. The slogans were "Don't be afraid of drought, only afraid of inaction," "As long as we work hard, we can resist drought," and "Resisting drought is resisting the Chiang army." Cadres and activists first consulted with the masses in various street food markets. Shen Wuben said, "That's right, the sun is so high in the sky. If we don't conserve water now, we won't get through this." Shen Xiaosan said, "We suffered enough that year. Wouldn't we have problems if the government didn't come up with a solution? You cadres really care about the masses. How can the masses not support you!" Based on the opinions of the masses, the cadres transformed the Production Committee into the Production and Famine Preparation Committee, and put forward the following call: (1) "Instead of waiting for rain, let's start early." Repair canals (a canal was damaged in 1942, and now we are organizing the masses to repair it), carry water to plant flowers and melons, plant one if we can. (2) "Heaven's mistake is man's loss." Strive to continue completing the sowing of sloping fields within seven days. (3) "Save and use sparingly." Each person should accumulate an average of seventy-five jin of wild vegetables (dried, including all aquatic vegetables). (4) Each woman should weave twenty-five straw hats and spin twenty jin of cotton. Men should transport goods and help with busy work. During the wheat harvest, one hundred laborers should be drawn to work short-term to earn one hundred shi of wheat. Take the time to engage in sideline occupations, striving for each person to earn ten thousand yuan before autumn to buy bran. After the call for production and famine preparation was made, cadres and activists went to various street food markets to mobilize the masses to promote production and famine preparation, so that everyone could make a plan. Xing Zhifu went to mobilize Yao Yuchang to make a plan. His family of five originally ate two jin of rice a day. From now on, they will mix in wild vegetables and save half a jin every day. By the end of the year, they can save one hundred and thirty-five jin of millet, enough to eat for three months. Take the time to engage in sideline occupations, and each person should earn an average of ten thousand yuan to buy bran to survive the famine. Convene meetings of wives and old men as family members to discuss production, famine preparation, saving, and frugality. After the meeting, some went to grind bran flour, and some changed their meals. In the past, they didn't eat bran at noon, but now they have started eating it.
    Masses gather in streets, all clamoring: "We must make preparations earlier this year!" At the request of the masses, the production director and other cadres led the masses to repair a large canal, which could irrigate more than 300 mu of land and save more than 130 mu of vegetable seedlings, which made the masses very happy. Lao Ying Yao Huozhu leads the masses to plant flowers. His group has already planted five mu and is preparing to plant another eight mu. Women's association cadre Kong Sixiang and others led women to collect wild vegetables. Fifty people collected more than 2,500 jin in one day.
    Currently, everyone in the village is planning production and famine preparation, striving to avoid going hungry even if a famine comes, and to supply the front line to win victory as soon as possible. (Shengqian, Xingyi, Junshi, Lanbang)

　　原曲全村订出计划
  　生产备荒同时进行
  　修筑大水渠救活菜苗百余亩
    【本报涉县讯】五区原曲村生产备荒的发动，是在全村男全半劳力和部分妇女大运粮当中提出的，口号是“不怕旱，光怕不动弹”，“只要干能抗旱”，“抗旱就是抗蒋军”等。干部积极分子先到各个街头饭市上和群众商量，申五本说：“可是该哩，天吊的这样高，现在要不细水长流，可渡不过去。”申小三说：“那一年受罪就受够啦，不是政府给咱想办法还有咱哩？你们当干部真关心群众，群众怎能不拥护你们！”干部依据群众意见，将生产委员会变为生产备荒委员会，提出号召：（一）等雨不如早动手，修渠（四二年坏了一道渠，现在组织群众修通了）、担水栽花、栽瓜，栽一棵算一棵。（二）“天误收人误丢”，争取在七天内继续完成坡地下种。（三）“省吃俭用细水长流”，每人平均要积野菜（干的）七十五斤（一切水菜在内）。（四）每个妇女要编二十五顶草帽，纺二十斤花，男人运输打忙工，在麦收时抽出一百个劳力打短工挣一百石麦子，抽空就搞副业，争取每人在秋前要赚一万元买成糠。生产备荒号召提出后，干部积极分子分头到各街饭市动员群众拉扯生产备荒，使每个人都订计划。邢治富去动员姚雨昌订计划，全家五口人，原来每天吃米二斤，从现在起每天掺野菜节省半斤，到年底可节省小米一百三十五斤，可吃三个月，抽时间搞副业，平均每人要赚一万元买糠渡荒。召开老婆老汉当家人会议，讨论生产备荒省吃俭用。散会后有的去推糠面，有的变了饭，过去晌午不吃糠，现在也吃开了。
    群众分街集会，都在吵闹着：“今年可要早些作准备哩！”在群众的要求下，生产主任等干部领导群众修开了一道大渠，能灌田三百余亩，救活菜苗一百三十余亩，群众很高兴。劳英姚火柱领导群众栽花，光他组现已栽五亩，准备还栽八亩。妇会干部孔四祥等领导妇女采野菜，五十人一天采了两千五百余斤。
    日前全村每人每户都在打算生产备荒，争取如果荒年到来也不饿肚，并要供给前线，争取胜利早日到来。（胜前、兴义、俊士、兰榜）
