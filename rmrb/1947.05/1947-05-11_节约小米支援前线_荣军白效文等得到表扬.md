　　Saving Millet to Support the Front Lines: Honored Veterans Bai Xiaowen and Others Receive Praise
    [This newspaper's Changzhi News] In Changzhi County, honorably discharged soldiers Bai Xiaowen, Li Liangsheng, Wang Shuancheng, Li Zhilin, Qin Erzhi, and five other comrades heroically fought the enemy on the front lines and were gloriously wounded. After returning home, they served as village cadres. During the land reform movement, they actively led the masses to defeat the feudal landlords and local bullies in the village, liberating themselves and the masses. For example, Comrade Bai Xiaowen and his wife were allocated three mu of good land (they originally had eight mu), eight rooms, four shi and two dou of grain, as well as livestock, furniture, and clothing. They rose from poor peasants to middle peasants, and their lives improved greatly compared to before. These five comrades unanimously believed that in order to defend the fruits of their liberation and help poor friends in the Chiang-controlled areas to also be liberated, it was necessary to defeat the big tyrant Chiang Kai-shek. In addition to stepping up militia training in the rear and improving military skills, they voluntarily saved the millet they were entitled to receive to support the front lines. Bai Xiaowen saved 1,170 jin of millet, Li Liangsheng saved 520 jin of millet, Wang Shuancheng saved 1,170 jin of millet, Wang Zhilin saved 780 jin of millet, and Qin Erzhi saved 1,170 jin of millet, totaling 4,810 jin of millet. The Taihang Third Special District Commissioner's Office believes that these five comrades were able to heroically fight the enemy on the front lines, lead the masses to liberation in the rear, and save to support the front lines, making them models for honorably discharged soldiers and worthy of reward and commendation.

    【本报长治讯】长治县荣退军人白效文、李良胜、王拴成、李之林、秦二只等五同志，在前方英勇杀敌光荣负伤，复员回家后，在村里担任村干部，土地改革运动中，积极领导群众，把村里的封建地主、恶霸打垮，他们和群众都翻了身。如白效文同志夫妇两口，分了三亩好地（原有八亩），八间房子，粮食四石二斗及牲口、家具、衣服等。从贫农上升到中农，生活较前大大改善。该五同志一致认为：为了保卫翻身果实，帮助支援蒋管区的穷朋友也都翻身，非打垮大恶霸蒋介石不行。除在后方加紧训练民兵，提高军事技能外，自愿节约应领之米，支援前线。白效文节约米一千一百七十斤，李良胜节约米五百二十斤，王拴成节约一千一百七十斤，王之林节约七百八十斤，秦二只节约一千一百七十斤，共米四千八百一十斤。太行三专署认为该五同志在前方能英勇杀敌，在后方又能领导群众翻身，节约支援前线，堪称荣退军人之模范，应予奖励表扬。
