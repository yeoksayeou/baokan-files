　　Establishing Merit-Based Models Promotes Sowing
    Hukuan First District Plants 5,000 Mu of Cotton in Eight Days
    [Report from Hukuan by this newspaper] At the beginning of the month, it was the time to plant cotton. Most of the village cadres and young people in the First District had gone to war, and everyone was at a loss. At this time, two promoters from the Changzhi Agricultural and Forestry Bureau came to the First District. On the 4th, they first convened a meeting of village cadres from seven villages in the sub-district to discuss cotton planting methods and organize all the women in the village to participate. At the meeting, the idea of launching a production campaign based on merit was proposed, stipulating that the village that completed the cotton planting plan would be credited with a merit. Immediately, everyone proposed to guarantee a crash planting. The women in each village also volunteered and said, "Cotton planting requires a lot of odd jobs. If we organize women and children, we can manage the cotton fields. Men can go to war, annihilate more Chiang's troops, win more victories, and defend our Chairman Mao." In this way, all seven villages in the sub-district organized more than 80 percent of their full and semi-labor force. During the crash planting, each village used public blackboards and broadcast cotton planting news to commend models, which played a significant role in promoting the work. Within eight days, all 5,500 mu of cotton fields in the district were sown. (Ma Lin, Zhi Gao, Hu Xian, Shi Rong, Jun De)

　　立功表模推动下种
    壶关一区八天种棉五千亩
    【本报壶关讯】月初正是植棉的时候，一区村干部和青壮年大部参战去了，大家没办法。这时恰好长治农林局两位推广员到了一区，四日首先召开小区七个村干部会议，讨论植棉办法及组织全村妇女参加种棉。会上并提出开展生产立功运动，订出那个村完成了种棉计划就算立了一功。当下大家提出，保证突击种完，各村妇女们也自报奋勇的说：“种棉费零工多，俺们妇女儿童组织起来，能管理棉花，男人们去参战，多歼灭几个蒋军，多打胜仗，保卫咱毛主席。”这样，全小区七个村便组织起全半劳力百分之八十以上。在突击种棉中，各村都利用大众黑板、广播种棉消息，表扬模范，起了很大推动作用、八天内，全区五千五百亩棉田全部下种。（马琳、志高、虎先、世荣、俊的）
