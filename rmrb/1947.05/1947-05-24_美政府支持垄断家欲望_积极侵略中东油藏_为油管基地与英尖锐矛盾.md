　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st—TASS, Moscow: Pravda recently published an article by the authoritative Soviet economist Varga on Near Eastern oil, stating in brief: According to recent materials, the Near East and Middle East account for 45 percent of the world's total oil reserves. This explains why Britain, France, and the United States, after twenty years of expansion, are still stubbornly fighting to obtain oil concessions here. It would seem that the United States, which accounts for 6 percent of the world's population, should be able to rest content with its own estimated 35 percent of the world's oil reserves and should not seek new oil resources in other countries. However, the actual situation is not so: First, the development and refining of oil is a very profitable industry, especially in backward countries with very cheap labor; second, considering the strategic importance of oil. Therefore, the U.S. government fully supports the desires of "its own" monopolists to acquire most of the oil reserves of other countries. The Near East oil reserves related to U.S. capital are continuing to grow compared to Britain. Especially in those areas where oil has only recently been discovered, in the latest statistics for 1946, Britain held 1.9 billion tons of all drilled oil reserves in the Near East, while the United States also held around 1.5 billion tons. As for oil production, in 1946 British oil fields produced about 22 million tons per year, while the United States reached about 11 million tons. However, U.S. production is increasing rapidly. Within eight years, the U.S. oil production increased from one-tenth to five-tenths of British oil production. If we remove Iran from the Near East region, the power of the United States is three times that of Britain. They continue to fight not only for oil reserves but also for oil transportation methods. Oil pipelines are the cheapest method of transportation. Since the United States has emerged as a power in the Mediterranean, American oil monopolists are very interested in rapidly laying pipelines from Saudi Arabia to the Mediterranean. There, in 1946, the oil mines leased by the United States produced more than 8 million tons. The construction of the Kirkuk-Haifa-Tripoli pipeline has also raised the question of its terminal. Currently, most of the eastern coast of the Mediterranean is controlled by Britain. Gaining a dominant position in this part of the Mediterranean enables it to strategically exploit its oil. The United States needs solid bases on the coast, and Palestine and Egypt, free from British influence, could become such bases and the terminal of the oil pipeline connecting Saudi Arabia and the Mediterranean. This is one of the reasons why the United States is currently striving to expand in this region.

　　美政府支持垄断家欲望
    积极侵略中东油藏         
    为油管基地与英尖锐矛盾
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报顷发表苏联权威经济学家瓦尔加有关近东石油之论文，略称：根据最近之材料，近东和中东总计占全世界油藏量的百分之四十五，这说明了为什么进行了二十年扩张的英法美为了获得在这里的石油租借权，而仍然正在顽强的斗争着。似乎是占全世界人口百分之六的美国，对于他自己的估计占全世界油藏百分之卅五的油藏是能够安心的满足了，而不应再在其他的国家寻求新的石油资源。然实际情形却非如此：第一，石油的开发与提炼是非常有利的实业，特别是在具有很低廉劳动力的落后国家；第二，考虑到石油的战略的重要性。所以美国政府完全支持“它自己的”垄断家们的欲望，获得其他国家大部的油藏。近东油藏与美国资本有关者，较诸英国正在继续增长。特别是在最近才发现石油的那些区域，在一九四六年的最后的统计中，近东所有试掘的油藏中，英国占有一百九十万万吨，美国亦占有一百五十万万吨左右。至于石油的产量，在一九四六年英国油田每年生产二千二百万吨左右，美国亦达一千一百万吨左右。然而，美国的产量正在迅速的增加着。八年之内，美国石油产量中等于英国石油产量的十分之一增加到十分之五；假若把近东部分除去伊朗，美国的势力则三倍于英国。它们之间，不仅为了油藏而且也为了石油的运输方法而继续斗争着。油管是最便宜的运输方法，自从美国出而变为地中海上的强国以后，美国的石油垄断家们对急速敷设从沙地阿拉伯通往地中海之油管甚感兴趣；在那里，一九四六年美国所租借的油矿生产量超过八百万吨。在克尔卡克——海法——的黎波里油管的建设中，又引起了它的终点问题。目前，地中海东部海岸的绝大部分都为英国所控制；在地中海的这一部分获得统治地位，就能够战略地利用它的石油。美国需要海岸上的坚固的基地，巴勒斯坦和埃及摆脱了英国的势力就能变成这样的基地和联结沙地阿拉伯与地中海之油管的终点。这就是目前美国在这一地域极力从事扩展的原因之一。
