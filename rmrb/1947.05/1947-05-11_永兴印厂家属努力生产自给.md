　　Family Members of Yongxing Printing Factory Strive for Self-Sufficiency Through Production

[Reported by this newspaper] To defeat the Chiang Kai-shek army as soon as possible, the family members of the Yongxing Printing Bureau's employees launched a self-sufficiency production movement to reduce the burden on the public. In addition to ensuring that their husbands and children have meals on time every day and doing other miscellaneous chores, they are completely involved in the production wave during their remaining time, and their enthusiasm is unprecedentedly high. The production methods are flexible, such as doing odd jobs like sorting waste paper, spinning cotton and weaving cloth, and bartering labor with each other, overcoming the difficulty of knowing how to spin but not how to weave. Secondly, as summer approaches, they are rushing to make single-layer clothes and shoes for their fellow workers, processing them day and night. According to statistics from March 1st to the end of April alone, nineteen family members earned a total of 120,145 yuan in bonuses (subsidiary occupations such as raising pigs, raising chickens, and collecting firewood are not included in the statistics). Some have been able to fully support themselves, and most can partially support themselves. For example, Zhang Shumin earned 3,000 yuan by spinning thread, 4,500 yuan by spinning five catties of cotton, 6,300 yuan by weaving striped cloth, 800 yuan for two pairs of single pants, and 800 yuan for a pair of shoes, totaling 15,400 yuan. Shi Meilan earned 4,500 yuan by spinning five catties of yarn in one month, 1,050 yuan by sorting waste paper, and 8,000 yuan by making diaries, totaling 13,550 yuan. In addition, Zhang Qiurong produced 10,800 yuan using this method, and Ren Yuzhen produced 10,300 yuan. Secondly, Xue Zhimin produced 8,170 yuan with two children, Wang Zhen produced 8,950 yuan with one child, and Ma Aiying and Li Yuxian both produced around 8,000 yuan. Gong Yuzhen produced 6,300 yuan with one child, and Zheng Xian'e, Zhang Zhuanping, Li Junqing, Bai Lingxian, and others all produced around 6,000 yuan, with the least being 3,350 yuan. The creation of these remarkable achievements is mainly due to the fact that their thinking has been straightened out. Under the influence of activists, they have overcome the feudal ideas of being unwilling to produce, relying on public meals, and the past belief that production was shameful, and have changed to the idea that production is the most glorious. In addition, the establishment of the family cooperative has solved many difficulties for them, such as distributing cotton and collecting yarn, and the prices of daily necessities such as oil, salt, soy sauce, and vinegar are cheap, allowing them to produce with peace of mind. The family cooperative earned a total of 160,000 yuan in bonuses in four months.

　　永兴印厂家属努力生产自给
    【本报讯】永兴印刷局职工家属为早日打败蒋军，展开生产自给运动，减轻公家负担；除每天保证丈夫和子女按时吃饭及其他零星杂活以外，余时完全卷入生产浪潮，情绪空前紧张。生产方式灵活，如打短工挑选废纸，纺花织布，互相变工，克服了会纺不会织的困难。其次，夏天已来，即给工友同志赶做单衣和单鞋，日夜加工，现仅山三月一日至四月底两月统计，十九个家属共赚红利十二万零一百四十五元（养猪、养鸡、拾柴等副业尚未统计），部分的已能全自给，一般的可半自给。例如张淑民纺线绳赚工资三千元，纺花五斤四千五百元，织花条子布六千三百元，单裤两条八百元，鞋子一双八百元，共一万五千四百元。石梅兰一个月纺纱五斤四千五百元，挑选废纸一千零五十元，做日记本子八千元，共一万三千五百五十元。还有张秋荣以此方法生产一万零八百元，任玉珍一万零三百元。其次，薛芝敏带两个孩子生产八千一百七十元，王珍带一个孩子生产八千九百五十元，马爱英、李玉仙均八千元左右。巩玉真带一个小孩生产六千三百元，郑先娥、张专屏、李俊青、白伶仙等均生产六千元左右，最少的三千三百五十元。这些显著的成绩之造成，主要是打通了思想，在积极分子影响之下，克服了不愿生产、靠公吃饭、及过去以为生产可耻的封建思想，变为生产最光荣的思想。另外家属合作社的成立，给她们解决了很多困难，如发花收纱，油、盐、酱、醋等日用品价钱便宜，使她们安心生产。家属合作社四个月共赚红利十六万元。
