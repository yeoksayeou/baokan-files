Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, May 17th: *Truth* newspaper recently published an international commentary by Leontiev which stated: The most significant event of the past week was the publication of the full text of Stalin's meeting and conversation with Stassen. The issue of cooperation between two different socio-economic systems—socialism and capitalism—discussed during this meeting is very interesting, both in principle and from a practical point of view. Some of Stassen's comments demonstrate that even well-informed American political leaders lack a clear understanding of the Soviet Union's attitude on this most important issue. However, the Soviet Union's attitude is very clear and definite. The author pointed out that Lenin at the Eleventh Congress of the All-Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and Stalin at the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Congresses repeatedly stated that the Soviet Union strives for a foreign policy of developing correct trade relations with all countries in the capitalist world. It is not the Soviet Union, but the short-sighted policies of certain countries that obstruct the strengthening of trade relations. Now, the world has once again heard Stalin's clear explanation of the basic principles of Soviet foreign policy; Stalin's authoritative discussion urging the recognition of the historical fact of the coexistence of two systems is very timely. Because recently, within some capitalist camps, there has been a tendency to forget this clear fact. The author denounced that after the full text of Stalin's meeting with Stassen was published, some British and American newspapers immediately attempted to distort its content. He said: As recognized by all progressive people in Europe and America, Stalin's conversation is full of love for peace and a desire for cooperation. It plays a significant role in exposing certain people who are now trying to forcibly impose opposition regimes on other countries, while hypocritically and groundlessly slandering the Soviet Union for cultivating the Soviet system in other countries.

　　苏联力求国际和平合作两种经济制度可以并存     
    里昂吉也夫评斯大林对史塔生谈话
    【新华社陕北十七日电】塔斯社讯：真理报顷发表里昂吉也夫之国际评论内称：过去一周来最重大的事件，就是斯大林接见史塔生谈话全文的发表。这次会见所谈到的两个不同的社会经济制度——社会主义与资本主义——的合作问题，不论在原则上和从实际观点来说，都是很有趣味的。史塔生的一些谈论证明了：即使消息灵通的美国政治领袖，对苏联关于这一最重要的问题的态度，也缺乏明确的观念。然而，苏联此种态度是十分明显而且确定的。作者指出列宁在联共（布）党第十一次大会上及斯大林在第十七次及第十八次大会上均曾一再说明，苏联力求与资本主义世界各国发展正确贸易关系的外交政策。而使贸易关系之加强受到阻挠的，不是苏联，而是某些国家的近视政策。如今世界又重新听到斯大林这样明确的解释苏联外交政策之基本原则；斯大林敦促承认两种制度并存之历史事实，此种具有权威意义的谈论是十分及时的。因为近来在某些资本主义营垒当中，出现了要忘掉这一明确事实的倾向。作者指斥在斯大林接见史塔生之谈话全文发表以后，某些英美报纸就立刻企图曲解其内容。他说：如像欧美所有进步人士所承认的一样，斯大林的谈话，充满了对和平的爱好和合作的愿望。而对于揭发某些人来说，它是具有重大作用的；这些人现在正力图将反对政体强行加于其他国家，同时竟又虚伪而毫无根据地诬蔑苏联要在他国培植苏联的制度。
