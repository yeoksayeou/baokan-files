　　Firmly Supporting the Masses
  　Changyuan Border Area Intensifies Land Distribution
    [Our newspaper, Jilu豫, 28th dispatch] The masses in the seventh district of the Changyuan border area are launching a revenge and anti-liquidation movement. This district is very close to the city, and the enemy harasses it frequently, causing severe damage to the masses. The masses are eager for revenge, but they fear enemy retaliation. Based on this situation, the leadership proposed firmly acting as the masters for the masses to move stones and lead the masses to carry out anti-"liquidation" and revenge movements. The militia went to each village ahead, and the armed mass mobilization work team in the rear specialized in land reform work, fighting guerrillas while leading the struggle. Each village also extensively used administrative power to convene mass meetings to declare that confiscating the property of local bullies and landlords was a government decree. After Caopo Village at the forefront distributed the property of a returning head of a reactionary team, the news spread to the rear. The masses in Dongxijiao Village not only dared to distribute, but also distributed it thoroughly. Then, six or seven villages, including Qianwuzhuang, Gongqiaoying, and Zhangbuzhai, all took action. After the government executed Zhang Haiyin, a local bully and landlord in Qianwuzhuang, the masses were very happy. While fighting, they completely distributed all his property. As a result, the cadres' confidence increased, and they realized that the masses' demand for land was urgent. The masses generally said, "As long as the government supports us, we will do whatever it says." In less than two days, the northern half of the area took action, creating a mass movement throughout the district.

　　坚决给群众撑腰
  　长垣边地加紧分田
    【本报冀鲁豫二十八日电】长垣边地七区群众开展复仇反倒算运动。该区离城很近，敌人经常骚扰，群众受到严重的摧残，群众迫切要求复仇，又怕敌人报复，根据此种情况，领导上提出坚决与群众作主搬石头，领导群众进行反“倒算”复仇运动。民兵在前方走一村作一村，后方的武装民运工作队专作土地改革工作，一面打游击一面领导斗争。各村并广泛运用行政力量，开群众会声明没收恶霸地主的东西，是政府的法令。最前方的草坡村分了一家还乡团队长的东西后，后方传开了，东西角城群众不但敢分，而且分的还很彻底，接着前吴庄、宫桥营、张卜寨等六、七个村子，都动起来了，政府枪毙了前吴庄恶霸地主张海寅后，群众非常高兴，一面打仗，一面把他的东西全部分光。由此干部信心增高了，认识到群众要求土地是迫切的，群众普遍的说：“政府只要给咱作主，说作啥就作啥。”不及两天的时间，北半部都动起来了，造成了全区群众性的运动。
