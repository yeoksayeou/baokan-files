　　[This article transmitted by our newspaper, Taiyue, on the 29th] The guerrilla warfare and land reform movement in Lingshi is developing rapidly. A strict curfew is universally implemented on the first line, and extensive enemy-killing and explosion movements are launched. Between the first and second lines, additional sentry posts are set up, and mutual defense pacts are signed, ensuring that every village fights when one village is attacked by the enemy. Landmine warfare tactics have shifted from simple defense to active offense, resulting in each district planting more than double the original number of mines. In villages such as Lv Zhuang in the first district, the landmines have been extended to the periphery of enemy strongholds, and the main roads within six or seven li of the town are blocked by landmines. Due to the vigorous progress of guerrilla warfare, farmers in thirty-five natural villages on the first line have rationally distributed land after speaking bitterness and re-examination. Villages such as Niwangmiao, Zhuangli, Daoqing, and Gouxi have also begun large-scale production. In a certain village in the first district, a liquidated element from a certain village within an enemy stronghold was also sent by the masses of that village to the guerrilla area for struggle.
    [This article transmitted by our newspaper, Taiyue, on the 29th] The militia and guerrilla forces of An'yi, Pinglu, Xiaxian, Wenxi, Jilu and other counties in southern Shanxi are actively launching attacks in coordination with the main forces in southern Shanxi. From the 1st to the 15th of this month, in half a month, they have annihilated 131 enemies, seized eight machine guns, 59 rifles and pistols, and more than 3,000 rounds of ammunition; and harvested more than 1,000 jin of electric wire. The activity of guerrilla warfare exceeds any previous period. Among the larger battles, the night raid on the Land Temple by the Pinglu militia and guerrillas on April 1st and the counterattack at ×Lan Village on the 7th were the most successful, resulting in a total of 52 enemies killed or captured with no casualties on our side.

　　灵石拿枪分田运动猛烈发展
    土地改革深入敌据点
    安邑平陆民兵配合主力出击
    【本报太岳廿九日电】灵石游击战争与土地改革运动一日千里向前发展。在第一道线上普遍实行大戒严、广泛开展杀敌与爆炸运动；一、二道线之间，增设复哨，并互订联防公约，一村有敌，村村都打。地雷爆炸战术改变过去单纯防御而为积极进攻，因而各区埋雷皆超过原数的一倍。一区吕庄等村的地雷已扩展至敌人据点周围，城关六七里路的交通要路皆为地雷封锁。由于游击战争的猛烈进展，第一道线上已有三十五个自然村的农民，经过诉苦、复查，合理的分配了土地，牛王庙、庄里、道清、沟西等村并已开始了大生产。在一区某某村，敌据点内某某村的被清算分子，亦被该村群众送来游击区斗争。
    【本报太岳二十九日电】晋南安邑、平陆、夏县、闻喜、稷麓等县民兵游击队，在配合晋南主力作战中积极出击。自本月一日至十五日半个月中已歼敌一三一人，缴获机枪八挺、长短枪五九支、子弹三千余发；并收割电线千余斤。游击战争的活跃，超过以往任何一个时期。其中较大战斗，应以四月一日和七日平陆民兵游击队夜袭土地庙及×岚村反击战为最，两役共毙俘敌五二名，我无伤亡。
