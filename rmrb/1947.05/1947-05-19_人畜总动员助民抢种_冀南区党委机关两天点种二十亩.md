　　People and Livestock Mobilized to Help Peasants with Emergency Planting
　　Jinnan District Party Committee机关 Plants Twenty Mu in Two Days
　　[This newspaper, Jinnan, 16th] After the District Party Committee issued an emergency call for seedling planting and emergency sowing, the District Party Committee机关 first suspended work for three days. Starting from the 8th, more than 50 cadres and staff members, and all 20-plus livestock of the 机关 were mobilized to help the masses with planting. During the planting, everyone's enthusiasm was extremely high, and they put forward slogans such as "Not only guarantee planting, but also guarantee seedling emergence" and "Water can only be watered more, not less." In two days, the whole group carried 1,200 loads of water and planted 20 mu of cotton. Under such influence and promotion, the masses stationed in the village, mainly militiamen, voluntarily organized themselves and have already planted more than 200 mu of cotton. After the efforts of cadres and the masses in these two days, the cotton of the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers and households without labor in the village has been completely planted. At this moment, the 机关 and the masses are still continuing the blitz planting.

　　In addition, the Jinnan Military Commission General Association, except for one female comrade and the cook who were left to take care of the work, all 13 cadres and staff members and 3 livestock were fully mobilized to help the masses with spring plowing. In one day, they plowed four and a half mu of land and planted more than six mu of cotton.

　　[This newspaper, Jinnan, 17th] Responding to the call to prevent drought and prepare for famine, all comrades of the Qi County Government helped the masses plant 13 mu of cotton under the scorching sun on the 5th of this month. More than ten cadres of the Jinnan Bank branch helped widows and orphans plant 12 mu of cotton in the stationed village, carrying a total of 490 loads of water, and using vehicles to transport 110 loads, an average of 50 loads of water per mu. In Feixiang, on May 1st, there was a two-finger rainfall. The county 机关 immediately led the masses to take advantage of the wet ground to plant cotton and helped those without labor, those serving in war duties, and the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers in the North Street of the city to carry out planting.
