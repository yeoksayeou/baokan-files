　　Young and Strong Men Join the Army to Fight Chiang Kai-shek; Men and Women in the Rear Busy Sowing Seeds

    Shimin and Other Places Organize Auxiliary Labor Production

    [Reported by our Taiyue office on the 7th] Shimin, Qinshui, Yangcheng, Gaoping and other counties are vigorously organizing women and children to participate in labor, completing both production and war support tasks. In Lucunhe Village, Yangcheng County, under the promotion of labor hero Bai Rusai, twenty-six women and twelve children have been organized into agricultural mutual aid teams, planting 266 mu of millet in five days. When the men went to join the army, they launched a large weeding competition, weeding all the wheat fields in three days. Women and children in Jide Village have been organized to plant 1,800 mu of millet in the whole village, and are now rushing to plant corn, which is expected to be completed in four days. Most mutual aid teams also practice intensive cultivation, applying an average of 60 loads of manure per mu. All autumn land, regardless of whether it was plowed last autumn, is plowed twice. Coal mine workers and primary school students in the village also take time to work in the fields early in the morning and at dusk, adding color to the production lineup. Primary school students in Quanfeng Village, Shimin, dug a canal to solve the village's drinking water difficulties; primary school students in Miaoyao carried more than 100 loads of manure for military families and conscripted laborers; primary school students in Motou created a combination of farming and studying, carrying more than 900 loads of manure and repairing more than 90 zhang of walls in ten days. In Nanzhuang Village, Gaoping, women, whose men are in the army, have taken on most of the agricultural labor. They have organized three mutual aid teams, which have promoted production in the whole village. Now they have finished planting the land of military families and conscripted laborers. The Anyuxian Mutual Aid Brigade in Qinshui started sowing on the 27th day of the second lunar month. Various labor forces were divided and cooperated with each other. The old man shook the seed drill, and the women and children pulled the seed drill, poured grain, and delivered manure, freeing up the men to join the army. By the beginning of March, the land was planted, and now the millet seedlings have all emerged from the soil.

    [Reported by our Lingchuan office] Women in Lingchuan participated in rear war support, freeing up male labor to go to the front line. A group of women organized by the Duohu District chopped 10,800 jin of firewood, which, in addition to their own use, was also supplied to the passing conscripted laborers. According to statistics, 108 male labor days were saved. Women in Xichedi, Tainan and other villages in the Fucheng District carried stretchers and transported wounded soldiers. Women in Huaishuling organized all the women in the village to divide the work of chopping firewood. The elderly and those with bound feet chopped on the mountains, and the young and those with large feet transported it back, saving a lot of work. (Xie Fei, Hua Nan)
