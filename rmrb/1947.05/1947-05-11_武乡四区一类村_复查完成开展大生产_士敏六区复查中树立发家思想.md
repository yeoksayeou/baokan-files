　　[This Newspaper, Wuxiang News] The eight first-class villages (those with relatively good land reform movements) in the Fourth District have successfully completed the re-examination movement and are now transitioning to large-scale production. These villages, after repeated inspections, have seen farmers recover a total of 2,060 mu of their own land, 33 head of livestock, 1,200 shi of grain, and many other items and assets. Poor and extremely poor peasants have been elevated to middle peasants. Before the movement, each person had an average of less than two mu of land; now, after turning the tables, each person has an average of 3.2 mu of land. On the 22nd of last month, a training method was used to mobilize production, with 532 people trained from the eight villages. First, a review of the liberation experience was launched to inspire everyone to get rich. The review revealed that 324 out of the 532 people were afraid of struggle and dared not get rich; 81 people believed that turning the tables meant getting rich and didn't want to work hard. In light of this situation, the leadership proposed the question: "Does turning the tables equal getting rich?" for everyone to discuss. Guo Muze from Jianzhang said, "Divided land and houses cannot be eaten, and divided grain cannot last forever. If you want to have it, you must work hard." Zhao Shuangyuan said, "My family has five people, and originally had five mu of land. After turning the tables, we have 18 mu. According to grain production, we should achieve 'two-thirds cultivation, one-third surplus,' but because production was not well managed, we only harvested six shi of grain last year. How can we live well? Zhao Quanzhong's family has five people, originally had one mu of land, and now has 16 mu. Last year, they harvested 18 shi of grain and earned 50,000 yuan from transportation, equivalent to five shi of rice. His wife spins and weaves, and after deducting clothing expenses, they have 60 jin of cotton left, equivalent to six shi of rice. After deducting 20 shi for food, they still have a surplus of nine shi of grain. I think we must work hard." In this way, the idea that turning the tables does not equal getting rich, and that getting rich requires hard work, was clarified. Then, everyone discussed how to get rich. Everyone believed that, on the one hand, it is necessary to cultivate intensively and do a good job in production; on the other hand, it is necessary to do a good job in sideline occupations. Li Hong from Manpo said, "The salt, oil, and miscellaneous expenses of the masses in our village are all paid by the mutual aid society, so there is no need to sell grain. Therefore, every family in our village achieved 'two-thirds cultivation, one-third surplus' last year." Finally, everyone discussed whether it is okay not to organize. Li Chouhai from Wu Village said, "I remember one year when I was sick, no one in my family moved. We only planted but didn't weed the 24 mu of land, and in the autumn we harvested only four shi of grain. The following spring we had nothing to eat, and sold our child for three dou of rice, and borrowed 20 yuan from someone, with interest added on top of interest, and became a pauper from then on." Li Chouze from Gezhen Village said, "I was sick last year and planted 15 mu of land, which was planted for me by the mutual aid group. In the autumn, I harvested 16 shi of grain, and achieved 'three-thirds cultivation, one-third surplus.'" This cleared everyone's thinking, and they believed that each going their own way is the root of poverty, and they must organize. After this meeting, everyone was very motivated and determined to go back and work hard to improve production.

　　[This Newspaper News] The villages in the Shimin Sixth District have now concluded their in-depth re-examination after seven days and are fully transitioning to production. In this re-examination, 25 landlords and old rich peasants who were not thoroughly dealt with were identified, and a total of 248 mu of land, 28 cattle and donkeys, and many other materials were recovered. After the re-examination, because the loss of middle peasants was compensated in the movement, the masses recognized the glory of labor, and their production enthusiasm was unprecedentedly high. In Wangbi Village, 95% of the male full laborers and more than 50% of the female full and semi-laborers are organized. Hou Dongqin, an old man over 50 years old, also joined the mutual aid group and worked as hard as the young people, carrying more manure than the young people, and the whole group elected her as a model member. Hou Meili and Hou Meiqing, who had never participated in labor, are now also participating in the mutual aid group and working even harder than the average person. Tian Limei, an old rich peasant from Dongjiashan, was left out in the movement last year, but he was very uneasy. After the re-examination solved his own problems, he returned some of the feudal exploitation to the masses. He did not feel disheartened at all, but instead felt relaxed and happy, and his production enthusiasm was even higher than before.

　　武乡四区一类村
    复查完成开展大生产
    士敏六区复查中树立发家思想
    【本报武乡讯】四区第一类型村（土地改革运动做得较好的）共八个，复查运动胜利结果，转入开展大生产。该类村经过数次反复检查，农民共收回自己土地二千零六十亩，牲口三十三头，粮食一千二百石，及其他物品资财甚多。贫农赤贫上升为中农，在运动前每人平均不到二亩地，现翻身每人平均三亩二分地。上月廿二号，以集训方法动员生产，八个村集训五百卅二人。首先展开回忆翻身检查，启发大家发财。检查中发现五百三十二中有三百二十四人怕斗争不敢发财；有八十一人认识翻了身就是发了家，不想好好劳动。依据这种情况，领导上即提出翻了身是不是等于发了财？让大家讨论，监漳郭木则说：“分上土地房屋不能吃，分上些粮食也不能经常有，要想有，还得好好劳动。”赵双元说：“俺家人五口，原五亩地，经过翻身成了十八亩，按产粮应做到耕二余一，可是因为生产没抓紧，去年只打了六石粮，怎能好活？赵全中人五口，原一亩地现成十六亩地，去年打粮十八石，运输赚钱五万元，折米五石，老婆纺织，除穿现存六十斤花，折米六石，除吃二十石还长粮九石，我认为好好劳动才行。”这样弄通了翻身不等于发了家，要发家还得好好劳动的思想。接着大家又讨论了如何发财的问题；大家认为，一方面要深耕细作，搞好生产，另一方面必须搞好副业。慢坡李红说：“俺村群众吃盐油杂费都是互助社开支，因此不用卖粮食，所以我村去年家家达到耕二余一”。最后大家讨论不组织行不行？吴村李臭孩说：“我记得有一年我有病，家中没人动，光种上没有锄，二十四亩地，秋天打了四石粮，第二年春没吃的，把小孩卖了三斗米，又借人家二十元，利上加利，从此成了穷光蛋。”圪针庄李臭则说：“我去年有病，种十五亩地，是由互助组给我种的，秋天打了十六石粮，还作到耕三余一。”这样打通了大家思想，认为各顾各是穷根之路，一定回去组织起来。经过这一会议，大家劲头很大，决心回去加油突击搞好生产。

    【本报讯】土敏六区各村经过七天来的深入复查，现已结束，全力转入生产。在这次复查中，共查出不彻底的地主、旧富农二十五户，共计退出地二百四十八亩，牛驴廿八头及其他物资甚多。经过复查之后，由于运动中结合补偿了中农损失，群众认识了劳动光荣，因此生产情绪即空前提高。王壁村的男全劳力组织起来百分之九十五，女全半劳力组织起来百分之五十以上。五十多岁的老汉侯东勤也参加到互助组里和年轻人一样做活，担粪比年轻人还担的多，全组人选她为模范组员。从来没有参加过劳动的侯美礼、侯美卿二人，现在也参加了互助组做活，比一般人的劲头还大。董家山的旧富农田礼美等，去年运动中把他遗漏下，但他很不安心，经过复查解决了自己的问题，把一部分封建剥削退给群众，他一点也不散心劲，反而感到轻松愉快，生产情绪比以前更高。
