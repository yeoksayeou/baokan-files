Lama and Wang Gong
    Qiupu

    At the Inner Mongolia People's Representative Conference, I interviewed two representatives: one was Tegexi Bayar, the ninth-generation Lama of Bayanchakemiao Temple in Zhalant Banner, who is forty-one years old this year. The other was Saxiyazabu, the stepson of Wang Gong Ye Xihaishun of the Xike Middle Banner, who is ten years younger than Te Lai and has received a lot of education.

    Saxiyazabu modestly said that his Mandarin was not fluent. He said, "The Mongolians have been oppressed for many years. Only now, with the help of the Chinese Communist Party, can we be considered truly autonomous." He refuted the fallacy that "there are no classes in Inner Mongolia" because he had personally experienced it. From the perspective of his class background, his father was a Wang Gong who possessed a large amount of land, while the vast majority of farmers and herdsmen were extremely poor. He highly praised the method of mutual assistance movement. When this movement was launched in the Xike Middle Banner, he took the lead in donating all of the more than 100,000 mu of land left by his father to the people. He believed that doing so was completely correct and should be done.

　　喇嘛与王公
    秋浦
    在内蒙人民代表大会上，我访问了两位代表：一位是特格希巴雅尔——扎赉特旗巴彦查开庙的第九代喇嘛，今年四十一岁了。另一位是西科中旗业喜海顺王公的继子萨喜雅扎布，比起特来要年青十岁，曾受过不少的教育。
    萨喜雅扎布自谦汉话讲得不纯熟，他说：“蒙古人多少年来都一直是在受压迫，只有现在在中共帮助下，我们才算得真正的自治了。”他批驳了“内蒙没有阶级”的谬论，因为他曾亲身体验。从他阶级成份来说，他的父亲是个犀公，据有大量土地，而广大的农牧民则是极其贫苦的。他非常称道互相运动的办法，当这一运动在西科中旗展开时，他首先就把父亲遗留下来的十余万亩土地全部捐献给人民，他认为这样做是完全正确的，应该的。
