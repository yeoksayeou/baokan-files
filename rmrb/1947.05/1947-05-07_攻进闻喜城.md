　　Capture of Wenxi City
　　Feng Mu　Ai Bai
　　A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army approached the outskirts of Wenxi City on the night of the 25th at a speed of fourteen li per hour. Along the way, they captured many "Homecoming Corps" members who had fled from the city upon hearing the news. One battalion's scouts and signalmen alone captured twelve, seizing seven rifles and two light machine guns. While setting up telephone lines, four telephone operators from the Second Company also captured ten, seizing eight rifles. Our army occupied the South Gate without encountering any resistance. The next morning, the enemy inside the city, still unaware that our army was at the gates, brazenly left the city to enter the blockhouses across the river. After the enemy entered the blockhouse, Zhang Jixiang of the Seventh Squad of the Seventh Platoon was the first to throw a grenade into the embrasure. As thick smoke rose, the entire squad occupied the blockhouse.

　　Around ten o'clock in the morning, the Second Company of the Second Battalion occupied the West Fort. The sound of the explosion was like a thunderclap; two-thirds of the large blockhouse in the southeast corner was overturned, and the earthen walls collapsed. The soldiers surged forward. Simultaneously, another unit of ours occupied Fanshan Temple in the east of the city. By this point, the strongholds on the outskirts of the city had been cleared.

　　At six fifty in the afternoon, the general offensive was launched. Nineteen artillery pieces fired in unison, and the blockhouses disintegrated one after another. The first mountain artillery shell fired from the south struck the blockhouse above the South Gate, destroying half of the gate tower. Mortar shells simultaneously landed on the roof, and the entire blockhouse collapsed. Dozens of light and heavy machine guns from the southwest accurately sealed off every gun embrasure on the city walls, and the enemy simply could not raise their heads. Demolition soldiers ran to the base of the city walls. After several dozen minutes, a deafening roar was heard, and the South Gate instantly disintegrated. Sandbags piled inside the city were sent flying several dozen feet. At this time, the west side also erupted in gunfire, and the entire southwestern part of the city was shrouded in dust and smoke. The soldiers advanced through the smoke. Three minutes after the first cannon was fired, the troops attacking from the southwest simultaneously mounted the city walls. The troops attacking from the south crossed the small river; soldier Shi Rongming was the first to reach the top of the city. The Fourth Squad of the Second Battalion, attacking from the west, successfully crossed the three hundred meters of open ground. Ma Pengxiang of the ladder team was the first to climb the city wall and rapidly advanced into the depths of the city. In just thirty minutes, all gunfire in the city ceased. The soldiers rested in the streets. The common people opened their doors wide to welcome them into their homes, but no one went in. Men and women, young and old, crowded at their doorways to greet them. They said, "We've been waiting for you for a long time!"

　　攻进闻喜城
    冯牧　艾柏
    人民解放军某部以每小时十四华里的速度，于二十五日夜接近闻喜城郊。他们沿路俘虏了许多闻风从城内逃出的“还乡团”，仅一营几个侦察员和通讯员就俘虏了十二名，获步枪七枝、轻机枪两挺。二营四个电话员在架电线时也俘了十名，缴获八枝步枪。我军占领南关，没遇到任何抵抗。翌日晨，城内守敌尚不知道我军兵临城下，仍大模大样的出城进入隔河碉堡。敌上碉堡后，七小队七班张继祥第一个把手榴弹投入碉堡枪眼，浓烟起处，全班占领碉堡。
    上午十点钟左右，二营二中队占领西堡，爆炸声如巨雷，东南角大碉堡三分之二翻了身，土围墙倒了，战士们一涌而进。同时我另一部占领城东番山寺。至此城郊据点，遂告扫清。
    下午六时五十分发动总攻，十九门大炮齐发，碉楼纷纷解体。从南面发出的第一发山炮弹正中南门上的碉堡，把门楼打掉半个，迫击炮弹同时落在楼顶上，整个碉堡塌倒了，几十挺轻重机枪从西南两面准确的封锁着每一个城墙上的枪眼，敌人根本抬不起头来。爆炸手跑到城墙下，几十分钟后，只听见天崩地裂的一声轰响，南门立刻解体，堆在城里的沙包，也飞出几丈远。这时，西面也打响了，整个城西南部笼罩在一片尘土浓烟之中，战士们冒着浓烟跑步前进。从第一炮发射后三分钟，西南两面的部队即同时登上城墙，从南面进攻的部队越过小河，战士史荣明，第一个上了城；从西面进攻的二营四小队，顺利地越过三百米的开阔地。架梯组的马彭祥头一个攀上城墙，迅速向纵深发展，仅三十分钟，全城枪声即告停止。战士们在街上休息着，老百姓都大开着街门欢迎他们进家，可是谁也没有进去。大街小巷男男女女都挤在门口看望，他们说：“我们早就盼望你们来了”！
