　　Red Flag Flies Every Month on the First Day
    Fengfeng Workers Produce to Support the Army
    8 Million Yuan Obtained on April 1st Sent to the Front
    [Our Newspaper's Report] To support the front lines, the workers of various kilns in the Fengfeng Mining Area, through democratic discussion, decided to designate the first day of each month as "Labor Production to Support the Front Lines Day." On this day, all staff members (except those selling coal) go down into the mines to participate in production. The workers do not receive wages, and the company does not calculate costs. All money from the production and sale is used to support the front lines. On this day, large red flags are planted at each wellhead, inscribed with "Labor Production to Support the Front Lines Day." All employees actively labor and produce under this red flag. It is calculated that 8,978,197 yuan was earned on April 1st alone, and has already been sent to the front lines. Under the enthusiastic production of this day, the coke ovens and other small kilns in the mining area, which were not originally included, have also automatically requested to participate in the production wave of supporting the front lines, and they also voluntarily send the labor income of this day to the front lines. For this year's "May Day" Labor Day, they prepared and arranged for the large-scale production movement from April 25th to 30th, and scheduled a memorial meeting and holiday for "May Day," with May 2nd as Labor Production Support the Front Line Day to make up for the one-day holiday, and large-scale production movement starting from the 3rd.

    [Our Newspaper Fengfeng News] On March 29th, the Fengfeng Coal Mine held a symposium on supporting the front lines. In order for the self-defense war to be victorious as soon as possible, the workers automatically proposed to contribute labor and money to support the front lines. Some contribute two days a month, and some contribute one day a month. All the workers of Tongshun Well proposed to contribute 1,600 baskets of coal per month (equivalent to 16,000 jin). These labor contributions will continue until the end of the self-defense war. (Feng)
    [Our Newspaper's Report] Under the leadership of manager Zhang Dewu, all cadres and staff of the Lita Coal Mine in He Village, Wu'an, organized several mining teams to take turns going down into the coal mines to dig coal. Under the influence of the cadres going down into the coal mines, the workers' production enthusiasm was increased. The workers said: "In the old society, how many people who operated coal mines knew the painful lives of coal miners? Only in the areas under the leadership of the Communist Party do cadres and workers truly share joys and sorrows." (Zhirang)
