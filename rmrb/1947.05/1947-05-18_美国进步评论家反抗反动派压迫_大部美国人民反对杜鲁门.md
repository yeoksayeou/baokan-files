　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th: TASS, New York dispatch: The New York Voice of Freedom Committee held a conference in New York to protest the dismissal of liberal radio commentators. 1,500 people attended. Radio commentators Hill and Kingdon, progressive critic Gallena, and Los Angeles critic Wells delivered speeches successively, pointing out that the purpose of dismissing liberal broadcasters was to support the reactionaries in suppressing resisters. Kingdon claimed that radio stations were controlled by a few very wealthy monopoly companies and only allowed the expression of "views that can be bought with money." Wells said: "If freedom of speech is strangled, the result will satisfy the requirements of the most brutal police state." All the speakers urged the conference to demand that the authorities restore free broadcasting programs. Former New York Mayor LaGuardia sent a telegram to the conference expressing his support. Participants vowed to continue to fight to defend the program of the Voice of Freedom Committee.

　　Also, the progressive black singer Robeson held a concert at Albany School, with an audience of 1,200 people. Before the concert began, Robeson said that in the next two years he would engage in systematic speeches against the American reactionaries; this systematic speech was arranged by the "American Progressive Citizens" and other liberal groups.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: Agence France-Presse, Chicago dispatch: Wallace said at a press conference in Chicago on the 14th that two-thirds of the American people oppose the Truman Doctrine. This estimate is based on personal letters he received and reports from various progressive groups. Wallace also pointed out that the U.S. "aid" to Greece and Turkey is based on a development plan to seize oil resources in Saudi Arabia.

    大部美国人民反对杜鲁门
    【新华社陕北十五日电】塔斯社纽约讯：纽约自由之声委员会在纽约主持召开大会，对自由主义的广播评论员之被解职，表示抗议。与会者达一千五百人。广播评论员希尔和金顿、进步评论家伽伦纳和洛杉矶评论家威尔斯相继发表演说，他们指出：辞退自由主义者的广播员职务的目的，是支持反动派以压制反抗者。金顿称：电台被控制在几个很富的垄断公司手里，只准表达那些“能够被金钱收买的观点”。威尔斯说：“如果言论自由被绞杀了，结果将满足最严酷的警察国家的要求。”所有的讲演人都敦请大会要求当局恢复自由广播节目。前纽约市长拉里第亚致电大会表示支持。与会者誓为保卫自由之声委员会之纲领而继续奋斗。
    又讯：进步黑人唱歌家罗宾逊曾在爱尔班尼学校内举行歌唱会，听众有一千二百人。歌唱开始前，罗宾逊称：今后两年内将从事反抗美国反动派的有系统演讲；此种有系统的演讲乃由“美国进步公民”及其他自由团体安排。
    【新华社陕北十六日电】据法国新闻社芝加哥讯：华莱士于十四日在芝加哥记者招待会上发表谈话称：三分之二的美国人民反对杜鲁门主义，这个估计是根据他个人收到的信件和各进步团体的报告。华氏并指出：美国对希土的那“援助”是基于一个攫取沙特阿拉伯石油资源的开发计划。
