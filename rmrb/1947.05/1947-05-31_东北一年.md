　　The Northeast in One Year
    In mid-May, the Northeast People's Liberation Army launched a counteroffensive on all fronts in North Manchuria, East Manchuria, South Manchuria, and West Manchuria. In less than half a month, they have eliminated more than three divisions (including two complete divisions) of the Northeast Kuomintang army above the regular army corps level, recovered cities and many important stations such as Shuangshan, Tongliao (recaptured for the second time), Liaoyuan, Huaide, Lishu, Gongzhuling, Shuangyang, Dongfeng, Huadian, Tonghua, Kangping (recaptured for the third time), and Faku (recaptured for the third time). They have cut across the Shenyang-Changchun and Shenyang-Jilin railways from the northwest and southeast, encircling the Kuomintang troops in Changchun and Jilin, isolating them from the Kuomintang troops in Shenyang and Qingyuan. The previously isolated North Manchuria, East Manchuria, South Manchuria, and West Manchuria Liberated Areas are now being completely connected. Although this counteroffensive is still in its initial stage, its development trend is already very clear. The once rampant Northeast Kuomintang army will, in the near future, only be able to retreat to a few isolated cities. General Lin Biao pointed out to reporters when he recaptured Gongzhuling on May 19th that this day was exactly the anniversary of the People's Liberation Army's withdrawal from Gongzhuling, pointing out that the situation in the Northeast has undergone tremendous changes in the past year. Indeed, this is a tremendous change. Anyone who pays attention to the situation and future of China must have a full understanding of this. The most noteworthy aspect of the changes in the Northeast situation is naturally military. A year ago today, the Northeast people ended the heroic defense of Sipingjie, which lasted more than a month, and voluntarily withdrew from the Gongzhuling-Changchun line. The Northeast people once hoped that this major concession could finally be exchanged for peace in the Northeast, but it did not happen. Chiang Kai-shek, blinded by superficial victory, mistakenly believed that the Northeast people's forces had "collapsed." He personally went to Changchun to command and continue the offensive, until the People's Liberation Army eliminated another six regiments of the Kuomintang army, which had suffered heavy blows in the half-year civil war, within a short period after withdrawing from Changchun. The 184th Division of the Yunnan Army in South Manchuria, under the leadership of Commander Pan Shuoduan, staged an anti-war uprising, and he then retreated, quietly returning to Nanjing. After this, Chiang Kai-shek, in an attempt to use "political methods" to force the people to submit and to cover up a large-scale offensive across the country, issued so-called ceasefire orders twice in June, limiting the dates and areas. The Northeast Kuomintang army still occupied Faku County and other places during the validity of the so-called ceasefire order. After July, such offensives occurred constantly, the important ones being the Battle of Andong in South Manchuria in October, and the Battles of Tongliao and Kaiping in West Manchuria, and the Battles of Kaiyuan and Tonghua in South Manchuria in November. However, the scale and extent of these offensives have clearly decreased. In the Battle of Tonghua, the entire 25th Division of the Kuomintang army was wiped out. Since then, the Kuomintang army in South Manchuria has launched four more unsuccessful offensives against the Linjiang area, each one more disastrous than the last. In the first offensive in early January, about one regiment of the 195th Division was lost. In the second offensive in early February, all of the 63rd Regiment of the Provisional 21st Division was lost. In the third offensive in the second half of February, all of the 272nd Regiment and an engineering battalion of the 91st Division were lost. In the last offensive at the end of March and early April, all of the 89th Division and all of the 162nd Regiment of the 54th Division were lost. During this period, the South Manchuria Liberation Army not only repelled these offensives, but also recovered the five cities of Huinan, Jinchuan, Liuhe, Ji'an, and Huanren. At the same time, the West Manchuria Liberation Army also recovered the four cities of Kulun, Kailu, Tongliao, and Kangping. The biggest blow to the Northeast Kuomintang army was the three crossings of the Songhua River by the North Manchuria Liberation Army. In the three battles of Qitamu in January, Chengzijie in February, and Kaoshantun in March, six regiments and all of the 88th Division of the Kuomintang army were annihilated. In this way, in the three months of the beginning of this year, the Northeast Liberation Army eliminated 69,400 Kuomintang troops, exceeding the result of eliminating 60,000 Kuomintang troops in the previous ten months. The law that the Liberation Army is becoming stronger and stronger with each battle, and the Kuomintang army is becoming weaker and weaker, has been proven on the North China battlefield, and it has also been proven on the Northeast battlefield. In the face of the powerful offensive of the Kuomintang army, the Kuomintang government, and the Kuomintang party, the people of Northeast China resisted and prepared at the same time, persevering and striving, enduring hardship and biding their time. After a short year, they have made great changes in the overall situation in the Northeast, making today's counteroffensive move forward courageously, with irresistible force. This achievement is truly amazing!
    How did this change come about? There is no doubt that the organizers, trainers, and commanders of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army have made indelible contributions to the cause of the Chinese people's liberation in the past year. However, the most profound root of this change, as General Lin Biao said, "should mainly be attributed to the masses." The events of the past year have provided the 35 million people of Northeast China with a wealth of education, enabling them to finally recognize friends and enemies, distinguish right from wrong, and determine their position. The masses in the Northeast, like the masses in the interior, have two teachers: one is Chiang Kai-shek, and the other is the Communist Party. But they have a special difficulty, which is that despite Chiang Kai-shek's policy of non-resistance selling them out to the Japanese invaders for fourteen years, and the Northeast Anti-Japanese Allied Army led by the Communist Party persisting in the anti-Japanese guerrilla war for fourteen years, most of the Northeast people who had been under long-term Japanese rule did not understand this history and the truth of these two teachers, and therefore had to learn from scratch. To be fair, Chiang Kai-shek's work as a teacher has been very diligent in the past year. Chiang Kai-shek has educated the people of Northeast China. His policy is to continue to cooperate closely with the Japanese invaders, preserve a large number of Japanese aggressive elements in the Northeast, and give them various preferential treatments. His policy is to continue to preserve the various enslavement systems and terrorist systems of the puppet Manchuria, continue to employ puppet police, and incorporate puppet troops and bandits. His policy is to sell the Northeast to the new master, the American imperialists, allowing American intelligence personnel, American troops, and American adventurers to run wild in the Kuomintang-controlled areas of the Northeast. His policy is to resolutely fight a civil war in the Northeast, and resolutely not compromise with the Communist Party and the Democratic Allied Army, who persisted in the anti-Japanese war in the Northeast, although the Communist Party and the Democratic Allied Army had repeatedly expressed this desire for compromise since the winter of the previous year. His policy is to resolutely implement dictatorship, oppose democracy, and not allow the people and ethnic minorities in the Northeast to have the right to autonomy and all freedoms. His policy is to conscript soldiers, collect grain, rape and plunder, make a fortune from receiving property, make a fortune from the civil war, make a fortune from corruption, make a fortune from circulating vouchers, make a fortune from prices, make a fortune from hoarding, and make a fortune from starvation. The Northeast people, who were once blindly "thinking of the Central Government and hoping for the Central Government," are now greatly awakened. They have correctly summarized Chiang Kai-shek's one-year rule with three words: "Second Manchuria!" But the other teacher of the Northeast people has given them completely opposite education. In the one year of struggle in the Northeast Liberated Areas, the Communist Party led the people of Northeast China to eliminate the forces of Japanese invaders and puppet Manchurian national traitors, eliminate more than 90,000 habitual bandits who had been harming the people for a long time under the protection of Japan and with the support of Chiang Kai-shek, and established democratically elected, three-thirds system, clean, and efficient local governments at all levels. In areas where the Mongolian nationality is in the majority, the Mongolian Autonomous Government was established. Especially after July of last year, 11,000 cadres were mobilized to go to the countryside to implement universal land reform. Up to now, excluding South Manchuria which has not yet been included in the statistics, 4.2 million farmers have been helped to free themselves from feudal exploitation and have obtained 33 million mu of land, thus laying a strong and unshakable foundation for the democratic cause in the Northeast. In this way, the people of Northeast China have recognized the Communist Party and trusted the Communist Party from facts (rather than from any propaganda), just as they have recognized Chiang Kai-shek and abandoned Chiang Kai-shek from facts (rather than from any propaganda). This fundamental change in the political life of the masses in the Northeast over the past year has determined the fundamental change in the military situation in the Northeast over the past year. On the one hand, the broad masses of the Northeast Liberated Areas, for their own benefit, have massively, continuously, and voluntarily participated in and supported the Northeast People's Liberation Army, filling it with forward momentum and confidence; on the other hand, the broad masses of the Northeast Kuomintang-controlled areas and the broad officers and soldiers of the Kuomintang army, also for their own benefit, have increasingly moved towards the anti-war and war-weary side. Recently, Northeast University in Shenyang, together with universities in the interior, went on strike, and not long ago, officers of the 89th Division gathered soldiers on the battlefield to surrender in formation, which are significant examples.
    The changes in the Northeast situation cannot but shake the whole country. Isn't the all-round counteroffensive of the Northeast Liberation Army a signal of the all-round counteroffensive of the entire Liberated Area? Isn't the Northeast, with its economic, political, and military importance in the country, being the first to launch a counteroffensive and achieve victory, greatly strengthening the position of the North China Liberation Army when it launches a counteroffensive? The Northeast Liberation Army is not the strongest in its Liberated Area, and the history of its composition and its connection with the masses is mostly very short. And Chiang Kai-shek in the Northeast has been fully supported by American imperialism from the beginning. Most of the Northeast Kuomintang army is equipped by the United States, trained by the United States, transported by the United States, supplied with ammunition by the United States, helped to command by the United States, and has the cooperation of the remaining forces of the Japanese invaders and puppet Manchuria, and the convenience of the blind orthodox concept among the masses, and the signboard of "victory" a year ago. But in a short time, the situation of offense and defense has turned 180 degrees. Then what hope is there for Chiang Kai-shek's plan to sell the country, wage civil war, and implement dictatorship? There is no hope, no future! The future of the Northeast belongs to the people of the Northeast, and the future of China belongs to the Chinese people. There is no room for doubt.

　　东北一年
    东北人民解放军已于五月中旬在北满、东满、南满、西满各线，开始反攻。不到半个月，已经消灭了东北蒋军正规军团以上兵力三个师以上（包括两个整师），收复了双山、通辽（第二次收复）、辽源、怀德、梨树、公主岭、双阳、东丰、桦甸、通化、康平（第三次收复）、法库（第三次收复）等城市和许多重要车站，由西北和东南横切了沈阳通长春和沈阳通吉林的铁路线，包围了长春、吉林两点的蒋军，使之与沈阳、清原的蒋军互相隔离。而过去被隔离的北满、东满、南满、西满解放军区，则正在完全联成一片。这个反攻，目前虽还在开始阶段，但其发展的趋势，已很明了。曾经猖獗一时的东北蒋军，在不久的将来，将只能退守屈指可数的几座孤城。林彪将军在五月十九日收复公主岭时，向记者指出这一天恰恰是人民解放军撤出公主岭的一周年，指出东北的形势，在这一年中是起了巨大的变化。的确，这是一个巨大的变化。凡是留心中国时局和前途的人，对此不可不有充分的认识。东北形势变化最引人注意的方面，自然是军事。去年今日，正是东北人民结束了一个多月的英勇的四平街保卫战，自动撤出公主岭、长春一线的时候。东北人民曾经希望以这个重大的让步，能够终于换得东北的和平，但是没有。被表面胜利冲昏了头脑的蒋介石，错以为东北人民力量“崩溃”了，亲自到长春去指挥，继续进攻，直到解放军在撤出长春后的短期内，又把已在半年内战中饱受打击的蒋军消灭掉六个团，南满滇军一八四师并在潘朔端师长领导下举行反战起义，他才知难而退，悄然回到南京。在这以后，蒋介石因为企图用“政治方法”压迫人民屈服和掩护全国范围的大举进攻，发表过六月间两次限定日期、限定区域的所谓停战令。东北蒋军在所谓停战令的有效期内，仍然侵占了法库县城和其他若干地方。在七月以后，这种进攻更是不断发生，其重要的则有十月南满安东之役，和西满通辽、开平之役，十一月南满开原、通化之役。但是，这些进攻的规模和程度都显然下降了。通化一战，蒋军二十五师全军覆没。此后，南满蒋军对临江地区，还作了四次失败的进攻，一次比一次失败得惨。今年一月初的第一次进攻，损失了一九五师的约一个团。二月初的第二次进攻，损失了暂二十一师的六十三团全部。二月后半月的第三次进攻，损失了九十一师的二七二团全部和一个工兵营。三月底四月初的最后一次进攻，损失了八十九师全部和五十四师的一六二团全部。南满解放军在此期间，不但击退了这些进攻，而且恢复了辉南、金川、柳河、辑安、桓仁五城。同时西满解放军也恢复了库伦、开鲁、通辽、康平四城。而对东北蒋军打击最大的，则是北满解放军的三渡松花江。在一月其塔木，二月城子街，三月靠山屯三次战役中，歼灭了蒋军六个团和八十八师全部。这样，在今年年初的三个月中，东北解放军就消灭了蒋军六万九千四百人，超过了去年十个月消灭蒋军六万的战果。解放军愈战愈强，蒋军愈战愈弱的规律，在华北战场上证明了，在东北战场上也证明了。东北人民在蒋军、蒋府、蒋党的强大进攻面前，一面抵抗，一面准备，坚毅奋发，卧薪尝胆，经过短短的一年，就使东北的大局焕然改观，就使今天的反攻一往直前，势如破竹，这个成绩实足令人惊叹！
    这个变化是怎样来的？毫无疑问，东北民主联军的组织者、训练者和指挥者们，在这一年中，对中国人民解放事业，是建立了不可磨灭的功勋。但是，这个变化的最深刻的根源，却如林彪将军所说：“主要地应归功于群众。”一年的事迹，使东北三千五百万群众，受到了丰富的教育，使他们最后认清了敌友，判明了是非，决定立场。东北的群众和关内的群众一样，有两个教员：一个是蒋介石，一个是共产党。只是他们有一个特别的困难，就是尽管蒋介石的不抵抗主义把他们出卖给日本侵略者十四年之久，而共产党领导的东北抗日联军坚持了抗日游击战争十四年之久；大部分在日本长期统治下的东北人民，却并不明白这一段历史和这两个教员的真相，因而不得不从新学起。应该说句公道话，蒋介石这个教员的工作，在过去一年内是十分努力的。蒋介石教育了东北人民，他的政策就是继续与日本侵略者密切合作，在东北保存大量的日本侵略分子，并加以种种优待；他的政策就是继续保存伪满的各种奴役制度和恐怖制度，继续任用伪警，收编伪军土匪；他的政策就是把东北出卖给新的主人美帝国主义者，让美国情报人员、美国军队和美国冒险家在东北蒋管区横行无忌；他的政策就是坚决在东北打内战，坚决不与坚持东北抗战的共产党和民主联军妥协，虽然共产党和民主联军从前年冬天起就曾经再三表示这种妥协的愿望；他的政策就是坚决实行独裁、反对民主，不让东北人民和少数民族有自治的权利和一切自由权利；他的政策就是征兵、征粮、奸淫掳掠、发接收财、发内战财、发贪污财、发流通券财、发物价财、发囤积财、发饥饿财。曾经盲目地“想中央、望中央”的东北人民，现在是大大觉悟了，他们把蒋介石一年的统治由三个字作了正确的总结：二满洲！但是东北人民的另一个教员，却给了他们完全相反的教育。共产党在东北解放区一年的奋斗中，领导东北人民肃清了日本侵略者和伪满民族叛逆的势力，肃清了在日本卵翼下和蒋介石支持下的长期为害人民的九万多惯匪，建立了民选的、三三制的、廉洁的和有效率的各级地方政府。在蒙古民族占多数的地方，则建立了蒙古自治政府。尤其是去年七月以后，动员了一万一千干部下乡，实行普遍的土地改革。到目前为止，除南满尚未统计在内，已经帮助四百二十万农民从封建剥削下翻了身，取得了三千三百万亩土地，从而为东北的民主事业奠定了坚强不拔的基础。东北人民就是这样从事实上（而不是从任何方面的宣传上）认识了共产党，信任了共产党，如同他们从事实上（而不是从任何方面的宣传上）认识了蒋介石，抛弃了蒋介石一样。一年来，东北群众政治生活中的这个根本变化，决定了一年来东北军事形势上的根本变化。一方面东北解放区的广大群众为了自己的利益，大量地、源源不绝地、自愿地参加和支援东北人民解放军，使之充满了前进的活力和信心；而另一方面，东北蒋管区的广大群众和蒋军的广大官兵，同样为了自己的利益，日益走到反战厌战的方面来。最近，沈阳东北大学和关内各大学一起，实行罢教、罢课，和不久以前八十九师官长在战场上集合士兵整队投降，正是显著的例证。
    东北形势的变化，不能不震动全国。东北解放军的全面反攻，难道不是整个解放区全面反攻的信号吗？以东北在全国经济上、政治上、军事上的重要而首先反攻，并取得胜利，难道不是大大加强了华北解放军反攻时的地位吗？东北解放军在其解放区来说，还不是最强大的，其组成的历史及其与群众联系的历史，大部分还很短。而蒋介石在东北则从一开始就受到美帝国主义的全力支持，大部分东北蒋军，都是美国装备的，美国训练的，美国运输的，美国接济军火的，美国帮助指挥的，又有日寇伪满残余势力的合作，又有群众中盲目的正统观念的便利，又有一年前“胜利”的招牌。但是，曾几何时，攻守优劣之势，就转了个一百八十度；那么蒋介石的卖国内战独裁计划，还有一点什么指望呢？没有一点指望，没有一点前途！东北的前途是东北人民的，中国的前途是中国人民的，没有一点怀疑的余地。
