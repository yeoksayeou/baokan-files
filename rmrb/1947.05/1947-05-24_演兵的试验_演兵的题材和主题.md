　　Experimenting with Military Exercises
    Thematic Material and Subject of Military Exercises
    Li Yun

    In the past, it was often difficult to find material in the life of soldiers. People said that the life of soldiers was monotonous, uniform, and impossible to perform on stage. At the beginning of this year's training, some comrades also believed: "Political study is easy to put on stage, but military training is difficult." After exploration, this problem was broken, proving that as a result of following the mass line, performing military exercises is not difficult. We realized and experienced that the life of soldiers is rich and vivid, even in the environment of garrison troops sharpening their swords without combat or marching, it is still full of infinitely valuable dramatic material. Recently, hundreds of large and small programs have been performed in our troops: those sharing broadcast experiences, praising figures, students praising cadres and administrative staff, administrative staff praising students, and criticizing and exposing bad phenomena. What was written about might be a class, a mutual aid group, an individual, or a mass scene. Each program more or less explained a problem or solved a problem. Therefore, we feel that in carrying out the "military exercise" movement, we must first have confidence, believing that the combat, training, production, and military-civilian relations of soldiers have infinitely rich things to perform. Secondly, the search for material should first start from the model figures, groups, classes, platoons... in your own unit and compile their strengths into plays to bring them out. That is to say: all good examples in the life of soldiers, work and study experience, the learning life of a mutual aid group, unity and fraternity, ideological transformation... can be brought to the stage. Work is progressing every day, and models are available every day, so the material is inexhaustible. Finally, when choosing a theme, we should focus on praise, mastering the principle of more praise and less criticism; specific praise and abstract criticism. We should look for the main thoughts of the masses as the basis for selecting themes.

    Boldly Bring Soldiers to the Stage

    In the past, it was always thought that the things performed in military exercises were simple and crude, and they were afraid of not being presentable. The results of this experiment have proved that we must break the old days of stage work and bring all aspects of the life of soldiers to the stage. In the past, we have brought all aspects of political study to the stage, and this time we have brought the four major techniques to the stage. In the play "Dream," construction, assassination, and jumping over wooden horses are all performed on stage; in the play "Eliminating Obstacles to Merit," there is a collective assassination by a class; in the plays "Star" and "Two Mutual Aid Groups," there is an assassination by a mutual aid group; in the play "No Sesame Cakes," there is also a live ammunition shooting performance. The audience was very interested in these scenes because they truly reproduced their own lives, constantly causing applause, cheers, joyful laughter, and even encountering some familiar songs and tunes, the stage and the audience hummed together involuntarily. Bringing the battlefield actions of soldiers' field exercises to the stage may be unaccustomed, awkward, inappropriate, or unaesthetic at first, but as long as we are bold, willing to create, willing to improve, and willing to listen to the opinions of the masses, we will eventually do a good job. In the past, many plays put these scenes in the background and used effects to replace them, and used dialogue to narrate them. This old method of performing military exercises should become a thing of the past.

    Of course, from the experiment, we also saw that performing military exercises is not necessarily on the stage, because soldiers are collective armed organizations, and many of their combat, life, and work scenes are limited on the stage, and it is not easy to perform the collective actions of most soldiers. Therefore, our experience is: we should perform military exercises more in the square, and gradually achieve that no matter marching, combat (possible situations), camping, or stationing, we can perform military exercises anywhere.

    How Do We Perform Soldiers?

    In addition to using forms such as clapper talk, storytelling, and peep shows... to sing about soldiers and express soldiers, we now usually use the following forms:

    One is like "Both Are Important," like "Construction Quick Report," using people to represent a thing (personification), and people explain the truth, such as the four major techniques each played by one person; various fortifications in construction are also played by one person, and in "No Sesame Cakes," people play the targets, etc.

    One is the performance method of bringing actual life military actions to the stage. For example, if a meeting is successfully held, after being cut, it is boldly brought to the stage to be replayed. For example, how the fourth and fifth class mutual aid groups live and study, that is, pick good excerpts and bring them to the stage to perform. In terms of actions, all the assassinations and aiming on the training ground can be done according to the actual situation, not necessarily too dramatized. Use real equipment as much as possible, and don't make any other props, so it is easy to generate a sense of reality and good integration with the actual situation, and it also saves the trouble of making props.

    One is to artistically spread experience on the training ground, compiling one's own assassination, shooting, grenade throwing, and other experiences into clapper talk and lyrics, with one person singing solo, two people singing in duet, singing and acting at the same time, and after singing, doing it again in practice. This method of spreading experience by acting, singing, and performing is lively, not boring, and remembered deeply. Although it cannot be regarded as drama, it can be said to be a visualized method of introducing experience.

    The Second Battalion's drums and gongs are blaring when crossing obstacles, as if on a battlefield, but also like acting, which is another way.

    The form of military exercises should be based on the existing skills of the soldiers. Whatever they know, they should do. At the beginning, the content and form may be uncoordinated, but it doesn't matter. As long as they dare to come, they should be advocated. For example, if he sings Wuqiang Yangko, let him use this tune to sing first, and then gradually promote other forms.

　　演兵的试验
    演兵的题材和主题
    立云
    从前在兵的生活中常常找不到题材，说兵的生活单调，千篇一律，没法上演。今年练兵之初，也有同志认为：“政治学习演戏容易，军事练兵演戏困难。”经过摸索，打破了这个难题，证明了走群众路线的结果，演兵也并不是难事；认识和体会到兵的生活是丰富而生动的，即使不作战行军而在驻军磨刀的环境下，也一样充满了无限宝贵的戏剧的题材。最近一个时期在我们部队中出演了百数十个大大小小的节目：有广播经验的，表扬人物的，学员歌颂干部、事务人员，事务人员歌颂学员的，批评与揭发坏现象的。写的或者是一个班，一个互助组，一个人，一个群众场面。每一个节目里面多多少少都说明了一个问题或解决了一个问题，因此，我们感到在开展“演兵”运动中，首先要有信心，相信兵的战斗、训练、生产、军民关系中有无限丰富的东西可以演。其次，找寻题材应当先从自己所在的单位里找寻模范人物、组、班、排……把他们的长处编成戏往外拿。这就是说：凡兵的生活中好的事例，工作学习经验，一个互助组的学习生活，团结友爱，思想转变，……都能搬上舞台。工作是天天进步，模范是天天有的，所以题材也是取之不尽用之不竭的。末了，在选择主题时，应当以表扬为主，掌握多表扬少批评；表扬具体，批评抽象的原则。应当找寻群众中当前主要的思想作为选择主题的根据。
    大胆把兵搬上台去
    过去总以为演兵的东西简陋，怕上不得台。此次试验的结果证明了要打破过去舞台工作的旧日子，把兵的全部生活搬上台去。过去我们把政治学习的各个方面都搬上台去了，这次又把四大技术搬到台上。《梦》一剧里筑城、刺杀、跳木马都在台上表演；《扫除立功障碍》一剧里有一个班的集体刺杀；《明星》和《两个互助组》剧里有一个互助组的刺杀；《不吃烧饼》一剧里还有实弹射击的表演。这样一些场面，观众十分感到兴趣，因为这些场面十分真切地再现了他们自己的生活，使其不断引起掌声，叫好声，欢悦的笑声，甚至遇见一些熟悉的歌曲和调子，台上台下不由自主地哼成了一片。把兵的野外操场战斗动作都搬上台，开始可能不习惯，不顺手，不恰当，不美观，但是，只要大胆，肯创造，肯改进，肯倾听群众意见，终于是会搞好的。历来不少的剧把这些场面多放在后台用效果来代替，用对白来叙述，这种旧的演兵方法，应该成为过时的东西了。
    当然，从试验中我们又看到演兵不一定就在舞台上，因为兵是集体的武装组织，他们许多战斗、生活、工作场面，有些在台上是要受局限的，表演多数兵的集体行动也不容易。所以我们的体会是：应多在广场演兵，逐渐做到不论行军、作战（可能情况）、宿营、驻扎，随处都可以演兵。
    我们怎样表演兵
    除了用快板、坠子、拉洋片……等形式唱兵表现兵之外，现在通常用的是这样几种形式：
    一种像“都重要”，《筑城活报》那样，用人来代表一件事物（拟人法），由人把道理讲出来，如四大技术各由一人扮饰；筑城中各种掩体也各由一人扮饰，“不吃烧饼”中由人饰靶子等。
    一种是把实际生活军事动作搬上舞台的表演法，譬如一个会开得成功，经裁剪后，就大胆搬上台重来一次。如四班、五班互助组是怎样生活和学习的，即拣好的截取片段，搬上台去演。动作方面凡属操场上的刺杀、瞄准都可照实际作，不一定太戏剧化了，能用真器材的都用真器材，不必另外制什么道具，这样易生真实感和实际结合好，也省去制道具的麻烦。
    一种是在操场上艺术化的传播经验，把自己的刺杀、射击、投弹等经验编成快板、歌词，有一人独唱的，两人对唱的，边唱边动作，唱了之后，再来实际作一次，这种又作又唱又表演的传播经验的方法，生动活泼不枯燥，记的深刻，虽不能算作戏剧，但可以说是一种形象化的介绍经验法。
    二大队在超越障碍时金鼓齐鸣，如临战场，但又像在演戏，这又是一种方式。
    演兵的形式，要根据兵现有的本领去要求，会啥就来啥，开始可能内容形式不协调，但是不要紧，只要敢来，就要提倡，譬如他唱武乡秧歌，就先让他用这个调子来唱，然后逐渐推广其他形式。
