　　[This Dispatch from Taiyue, 19th] During the great labor exchange in Fushan County, Zhao Meiying, the woman hero of the Shi Zhenming Joint Brigade, led 102 able-bodied men and women, along with 102 head of livestock, from five villages, including Fancun and Yuantou, to the newly recovered Third District to assist in farming. Zhao Meiying's brigade departed on the 5th, and after a journey of over a hundred li, arrived at villages such as Shanqu, Dongzhang, and Liangjiahe in the Third District on the 7th. They divided every five villages into one sub-district, led by a squad leader. One village forms a team, led by a team leader. They also established regulations for leave, meetings, work point recording, reporting, and learning. In five days, they have already rushed to cultivate 1,560 mu of land. It is estimated that within seven days, they will complete the cultivation of land belonging to military personnel, cadres, martyrs' families, and civilian laborers participating in the war in these eighteen villages. Zhang Lanying and Chai Xiuying, the two female heroes accompanying Zhao Meiying, are both all-round experts in farming, plowing steadily and sowing meticulously, earning high praise from the local masses. Under their influence, local women have also begun to put down their needlework and go to the fields to produce. After the brigade entered the new district, Zhao Meiying also proposed the slogan "Production and Propaganda Go Hand in Hand," taking advantage of various opportunities to promote the happy life of the farmers in the old liberated areas.
