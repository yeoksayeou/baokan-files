　　Experiences of Renzhuang Village, Licheng, in Solving the Wage Problem
　　Han Cunliang, Wang Shunqing
　　Last year, the wage in Renzhuang Village was six and four-tenths catties of rice per day, calculated as five *shang* (a unit of time or work, roughly equivalent to half a day), with each *shang* being one and four-tenths catties. During this time, some people took advantage, feigning illness when it was their turn to work, thinking, "Giving up five or six catties of rice isn't much. Now I can rest at home." This year, during the rectification of mutual aid, everyone felt that six and four-tenths catties were too little, so it was increased to ten catties, two catties per *shang*. In specific implementation, Shen Yuqin, the labor hero who led the first brigade, had three households without labor power. Whenever they were assigned *biangong* (exchange labor), they were charged four taels less per *shang*, others two catties, they one catty twelve taels, and efforts were made to have them repay as much work as possible. If they couldn't repay it all, they would use methods such as making clothes or weaving to repay it. The other teams generally paid equivalent wages of ten catties of rice.

　　In early May, households with sufficient labor and livestock proposed increasing it to twelve and a half catties. This proposal was passed by the second brigade. At that time, three types of people showed three types of attitudes at the meeting: some households with surplus labor actively advocated increasing the wage rice; some self-cultivating households who did not lack labor did not express an attitude, whether you raise it or not. Therefore, labor-deficient military families, widows, widowers, and orphans, even if they wanted to object, were in the minority and had to keep it to themselves. When it was ten catties of rice per work unit, Shen Daozhong said, "I won't farm the land anymore, I can earn ninety catties a month by working for others for nine days, enough for my family to eat." Shen Jin, in the mutual aid group, shouldered half a labor force, moved half a mu (Chinese acre) of sheep manure to the land, and worked thirty-seven and a half *shang*, equivalent to seventy-four catties of rice. He said, "The land is impossible to farm, just moving manure took more than seventy catties of rice, how much can half a mu yield even if it's fully fertilized?" From these reflections, ten catties of rice was heavy enough, let alone twelve and a half catties? After implementing the new wage rice, even those who originally proposed the increase felt difficulties. First, they considered that the wages of the three brigades were not unified, and it would be difficult to calculate accounts in the future for large-scale *biangong*, participation in war, and supporting the *chai* (government work, corvee labor); secondly, the freight earned from one trip was not enough for the wage rice he should earn himself. Therefore, in a few days, the whole village unified again to ten catties; but even calculated at ten catties, problems still existed in implementation.

　　1. Affecting transportation production: the wage rice is high, the freight is low, not only does it not make money, but the brigade also has to lose money. For example, starting from Renzhuang, going to Henan Dian and then to Changzhi and returning, each catty carried can earn 37 yuan in freight. Each cart carries 420 catties, earning a total of 15,540 yuan in freight. The round trip takes seven days, calculated as 120 catties for one labor force, 420 catties equals three and a half labor forces. One labor force at ten catties of rice per day should earn a total of 245 catties of rice, calculated at 60 yuan per catty, totaling 14,700 yuan in silver. Adding travel expenses of 1,300 yuan per day, seven days total 9,100 yuan in silver. The wage rice plus travel expenses totals 23,800 yuan. Calculating the accounts, each cart loses 8,260 yuan net, so the livestock are all tied up.

　　2. Affecting intensive farming. Because the wage rice is high, everyone wants to help others in mutual aid to earn rice, and doesn't want to work for themselves and take out rice. The edges of the fields that should be repaired are not repaired. Instead of applying thirty loads of manure per mu, they apply twenty. One farmer said, "You can just barely do your own work, and if you do it well, you'll have to miss more work!" The mutual aid group wanted to help Shen Yuzhi carry water to plant flowers, but was rejected. He said, "I won't plant flowers or grain, I want to plant beans." Some vegetable garden land on the edge of the village is also poorly cared for because "labor is expensive." Many small pieces of irrigated land close to the well, some have weeds taller than the chives, some are still barren.

　　3. It is universally reflected that now it is not the land supporting the people but the people supporting the land. One mu of grain land requires 14 work units, totaling 140 catties of wage rice, equivalent to four and a half *dou* (peck). In a good year, one mu of land can yield seven *dou* of grain, producing four *dou* two *sheng* (tenth of a peck) of rice. Burdens, seeds, and fertilizer are completely included in it. Calculated down, planting one mu still loses three *sheng* of rice. This problem is even more serious for newly turned-over households lacking labor and for widows, widowers, and orphans. The idea of "farming is not worth the cost" is emerging among the farmers, and they are not thinking about how to increase production, but only how to save labor.

　　Based on the above situation and mass reflections, labor hero Shen Yuqin first convened a meeting of team leaders to discuss why our transportation has been losing money recently. From specific calculations, everyone felt that farming was also losing money. The reason was unanimously concluded to be that the wage rice was too high, and it was immediately reduced from ten catties to seven and a half catties. The next night, after small group deliberation and discussion at the Minxiao (people's school), everyone unanimously agreed that the past was too high. The seven and a half catties wage rice was passed smoothly by everyone. At the same time, new methods were further stipulated in the combination of agriculture and transportation. When transporting outside for one day, 120 catties are counted as one labor force, and each cart carrying 420 catties is equivalent to three and a half labor forces (one person, two livestock, half a cart). The freight earned from carrying more than 420 catties belongs to the individual. Each time they return from transportation, they report to the brigade. After deducting the discounted price of their own wage rice, the remaining amount is used as a reward, from which to solve the travel expenses. However, the bonus should not exceed the market price of the fare. In order to stimulate everyone to work more, the profits earned from transportation in the future will be distributed as extra work points. In addition to receiving 70% of the entire bonus, the surplus labor force can also share 30% of everyone's, so that the mutual aid relationship can be close. If the rain delays the journey, only travel expenses are paid and no work is recorded. Returning with an empty cart is counted as half a day's work.

　　From the above materials, it can be seen that the equivalent wage in the great production movement is a relatively major issue. If it is not resolved well, it will directly affect the completion of the "cultivate three, save one" plan. Renzhuang Village used the accounting method to open up the masses' thinking to reduce wages, reaching a level that everyone considered relatively fair and reasonable. This is very good, but more importantly, from enlightening the class consciousness of the masses, the slogan that farmers all over the world are one family should be routinely incorporated into the great production movement. The masses in Fengtuo, Second District, have reflected this: "Now it's time for the objects of struggle to get rich. They have no land and only earn wage rice. Not to mention cultivating three, saving one, cultivating one and saving one can also be achieved. It doesn't matter whether they plant land or not." Shen Benfu, a newly turned-over farmer in Renzhuang, said, "I have more land now, but I can't afford the wages to plant it. Our *gedao* (a dialect word for hardship) is getting deeper and deeper." In the past, the wages were higher to prevent landlords from taking advantage. After the checking reduction and leveling compensation movement, the broad masses of peasants just got land, and the capital to manage these lands is lacking. Higher wages are not good for them. Secondly, it is also necessary to widely organize semi-labor forces and auxiliary labor forces to actively participate in production, master the principle of work exchange, and overcome the difficulty of lacking labor.

　　黎城仁庄村解决工资问题经验
    韩村良　王顺庆
    去年仁庄村的工资米六斤四两，每天以五晌计，每晌一斤四两。在这当中曾有人钻过空子，轮到他还工时就装病，以为“出上五、六斤米不算啥。现能在家休息一回。”今年整顿互助的时候，大家感到六斤四两太少，增为十斤，每晌二斤。在具体执行中，劳动英雄申玉芹领导的第一大队有三户无劳力的，每当给他们变工的时候，一晌少要四两，别人二斤，他们一斤十二两，并争取使他们尽量还工，如果万一还不清，就用作衣服、纺织等办法来还工，其他队一般都是按十斤出等价工资米。
    五月上旬，劳畜力都不缺的家户提议增为十二斤半，这个提议被第二大队通过了。当时会议上可以看出三种人三种态度，一种是有剩余劳力户积极主张提高工资米；一种是自耕自种的不缺劳力户，你们涨也好不涨也好不表示态度。因此，缺乏劳力户军属鳏寡孤独即使想反对，却成了少数，只好闷在肚里不提罢了。在每个工十斤米的时候，申道中这样说：“我不种地了，每月抽九天给别人干可赚九十斤，够我一家吃啦”。申进在互助组顶半个劳力，往地搬了半亩地羊粪，就出了三十七晌半，合米七十四斤，他说：“地没法种啦，光搬粪就出了七十多斤米，半亩地通满才能打多少？”从这些反映里看十斤米就够重了，何况十二斤半呢？实行新工资米后，就原先提议增资的也感到困难。第一顾及三个大队工资不统一，将来大变工、参战、支差时不好算账；其次是运输一趟赚回的脚价不够他自己应赚的工资米。因此，不几天全村又统一成为十斤；但就以十斤计算，在执行中问题是依然存在着。
    一、影响运输生产，工资米高，运费低，不但不赚钱，大队还得赔钱。例如从仁庄出发到河南店再到长治返回，每载一斤可赚运费三十七元，每辆车载四百二十斤，共赚运费一万五千五百四十元，往返须七天，以一百二十斤计一个劳力，四百二十斤合三个半劳力，七天合二十四个半劳力。一个劳力每天按十斤米，共应赚米二百四十五斤，每斤以六十元计，合洋一万四千七百元，每天再加路费一千三百元，七天合洋九千一百元，工资米加上路费共合二万三千八百元，算起账来，每辆大车净亏八千二百六十元，因之牲口都拴起来了。
    二、影响精耕细作。由于工资米高，都想给别人互助赚米，而不想干自己的往出拿米，地边该修的不修了，每亩应上三十驮粪上二十驮就算了，一个农民这样说：“自己活儿好歹干干就算了，干的好了还得多误工哩！”互助组要给申玉枝担水栽花，遭到拒绝，他说：“我花也不栽，谷也不栽，我想种豆儿”。村边上一些菜园地也是因为“工贵”而照顾的不周到了，很多距井近小块水浇地，有的草比韭菜高，有的仍然荒芜着。
    三、普遍反映着现在不是地养人而是人养地，一亩谷地按实用工须十四个，合工资米一百四十斤，等于四大斗半。好年景一亩地能收七大斗谷，出米四大斗二升，负担、种籽、肥料完全贴到里面，计算下来种一亩还得赔三大升米。这个问题在新翻身户缺乏劳力及鳏寡孤独户里更为厉害，“种地不够本”的思想在农民当中产生出来，不想如何增产，而光打算怎样能省工怎样办。
    劳动英雄申玉芹根据以上情况及群众反映，首先召集各队组长开会，讨论最近咱运输为什么赔钱，大家从具体算账中，感到种地也是赔钱的，归结原因，一致认为工资米太高，当即由十斤降至七斤半。第二天晚又在民校经过小组酝酿讨论，大家异口同声认为过去的太高，七斤半工资米很顺利被大家通过了，同时在农业和运输的结合上，也进一步规定了新办法。在外运输一天，一百二十斤作一个劳力，每辆载四百二十斤折三个半劳力（人一个、牲口二个、车半个），载四百二十斤以上所赚运费归个人，每次运输回来向大队报账，除去自己应赚工资米折价外，根据剩余多少作为奖励，从中解决盘费问题，但奖励金最多不超过相等市价的路费。为刺激大家多劳动，将来运输赚的红利，实行余工分红。剩余劳力除分整个红利的百分之七十外，还可分大家的百分之三十，这样使互助关系能密切起来。下雨在外耽误了只发路费不记工，放空车回来按天记工一半。
    从以上材料看出，大生产运动中的等价工资是比较主要的问题，如果解决的不好，会直接影响耕三余一计划的完成，仁庄村是用算账办法打通群众思想使工资降低，作到大家认为比较公平合理的程度。这一点很好，但更重要的是从启发群众阶级自觉，天下农民是一家的口号应照例贯串到大生产运动中。二区风驼群众就有这样的反映：“现在可该斗争对象们发财啦，人家没地光赚工资米，别说耕三余一，耕一余一也能达到，种不种地没啥关系”。仁庄新翻身农民申本富说：“我现今地多了，种吧出不起工资，咱的圪道越填越深啦”。过去工资高些，是为防止地主钻空子，经过查减及填平补齐运动以后，广大农民刚才得到土地，经营这些土地的资本是欠缺的，工资高了对他们没有好处，其次还须广泛组织半劳力、辅助劳力积极参加生产，掌握工换工的原则，克服劳力缺乏的困难。
