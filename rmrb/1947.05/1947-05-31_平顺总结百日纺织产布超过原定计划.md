　　[This Dispatch from Pingshun] Pingshun summarized the hundred-day textile movement, exceeding the plan by 20% in 75 days. After Pingshun convened a county and district cadre meeting on February 20th to deploy the hundred-day textile work, the entire county launched a vigorous movement under slogans such as "Become prosperous through textiles, don't buy cloth for the changing seasons" and "People, spinning wheels, and machines should never be idle." In various places, eighty-year-old women, six or seven-year-old girls, the blind, the disabled, village cadres, militia, and government organizations and schools all participated in the movement. As of May 10th, the entire county had spun more than 290,000 jin of cotton and woven more than 180,000 jin of cloth. According to the original plan, 80% of the cotton spinning and 56% of the cloth weaving tasks were completed. If calculated based on the actual 75 days from the start to the summary in various places, the textile task was exceeded by 20%. Taking the amount of cloth woven alone, it is enough for the 110,000 people in the county to change clothes for the season. This achievement is unprecedented in Pingshun's history. During the county-wide textile movement, 2,581 new female spinners were added (accounting for 12% of the original), 1,089 new female weavers were added, 617 new hand-cranked machines were added (doubling the existing number), and more than 7,000 spinning wheels were added, most of which were new.
    Recently, truly mass mobilization has been achieved, giving play to mass creativity. For example, in the cotton spinning movement, female spinners have been extensively organized. Small groups combine to weave cloth, emphasizing the relationship between teacher and apprentice. Statistics show that the First District is relatively advanced, with 95% of female spinners organized, while other six districts have reached 85%, and the minimum is 60%. The leadership has now put forward the call to implement textile production throughout the year, planning to complete a new plan of 250,000 jin of cloth before "August 1st". (Joint Office)

　　平顺总结百日纺织产布超过原定计划
    【本报平顺讯】平顺总结百日纺织运动，七十五天超过计划百分之二十。平顺于二月二十日召开县区扩干会议，布置百日纺织工作后，全县在“纺织发家，换季不买布”、“人、车、机三不闲”等口号下，运动猛烈开展。各地八十岁的老太婆，六、七岁的小女孩，瞎子、残废、村干部、民兵及机关学校都卷入运动。截至五月十日统计，全县已纺花二十九万余斤，织布十八万多斤，按原计划纺花完成百分之八十，织布完成百分之五十六，若按各地从开始到总结实际时间七十五天来统计，则超过纺织任务百分之二十。单拿织布数目来说，已够全县十一万群众换季。这个成绩在平顺历史上说来还是空前的。全县纺织运动中增加新纺妇二千五百八十一名（占原有百分之十二），增加的织妇一千零八十九名，手拉机增加六百一十七架（新增一倍），增加纺车七千余辆，而且大部是新纺车。
    最近真正成为群众性的组织起来，发挥群众创造，如纺花运动中纺妇均大量组织起来，小组合机织布，强调了师徒关系，统计一区比较先进，纺妇组织起来的达百分之九十五，其他六区为百分之八十五，最少亦达百分之六十。现领导上已提出纺织贯彻全年的号召，计划“八一”以前，全县再完成二十五万斤大布的新计划。（联合办公室）
