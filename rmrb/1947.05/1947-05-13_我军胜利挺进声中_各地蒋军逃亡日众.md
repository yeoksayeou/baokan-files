Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th. Amidst the victorious advance of the People's Liberation Army, lower-ranking officers and soldiers of Chiang's troops in various regions are deserting in increasing numbers. More than 400 men have deserted from the 218th Regiment of the 73rd Division of Yan's army (originally stationed in Jiexiu), which originally had more than 700 men. After the liberation of Jiexian, almost all of the 1,800 new recruits conscripted by Yan Xishan last year in the Jiexian and Anyi areas have deserted. In Hongtong, Zhaocheng, and other places, under the influence of the "calling sons home" movement by families, Yan's soldiers are deserting with their weapons. After the annihilation of the entire 72nd Division of Chiang's army in the Tai'an campaign, more than 70 men deserted from the newly formed 73rd Army (note: this refers to the 73rd Army, which was hastily reorganized by Chiang Kai-shek with local armed forces and conscripts after the three divisions of the 73rd Army were completely wiped out in the Laiwu campaign) and the 77th Division in Jinan in a single day. The remaining machine gun platoon of the newly formed Second Battalion of Zibo, which had already lost most of its men in the Laiwu campaign, has completely deserted. After the victory of the People's Liberation Army in northern Jiangsu against the counterattack on Huji, Wang Jiatai, the deputy platoon leader of Chiang's army in Huji, and others defected to the liberated area while going to the countryside to arrest deserters. Chiang's army in Baoying keeps its soldiers concentrated together all day long to prevent desertion. The remnants of Ye Ting's (Yancheng) Chiang's army pack their bags every day, waiting for the sound of gunfire to flee immediately. Chiang's "Homecoming Corps" are crowding the wharves, waiting for boats to escape to the south of the Yangtze River. Zuo Jihan, the head of Chiang's Funing Judicial Section, and Zuo Tiesheng, the head of the Finance Section, have successively requested to resign and be transferred to "safe areas."

This newspaper, Taiyue, 11th. The "desertion wind" is intensifying among Yan's troops in Pingyao, Jiexiu, Lingshi, and other places. According to Guo Hongtong, a soldier from the 5th Company of the 2nd Battalion of the 219th Regiment of the 73rd Division who escaped, "After the Eighth Route Army occupied the city of Huoxian, our 5th Company had 70 or 80 men, but in a few days, only 20 or 30 men were left." Lu Yujie and Hu Shoren, new recruits from the 217th Regiment of the 69th Division stationed in Antian Village, Jiexiu, said: "We are from Zhangyinghe Village, Yongji. We were conscripted in February this year. Yan Xishan conscripted more than 2,400 people in our county, all of whom were organized into reserve soldiers. Now only 500 or 600 men are left, and there are more than 100 sick. We only get half a catty of millet every day, and more than 30 people have died in less than a month. Even more are deserting these days. Twenty people were conscripted from our village, and eighteen have already run away." In order to prevent soldiers from deserting, Yan Xishan formed groups of six in the army. If one person deserts, the other five are beaten, but to no avail. Guo Pangzi, a soldier from the 8th Company of the 2nd Battalion of the 14th Security Regiment of Yan's army stationed in Haojiabao, Pingyao, said: The regiment originally had more than a thousand men, but now only 400 or 500 men are left. The Second Battalion originally had more than 300 men, but now only a hundred or so are left. A farmer from Zhaocheng went to Yan's army to call his son home and said, "The Eighth Route Army in southern Shanxi has captured thirteen county towns (now nineteen county towns), you should go home quickly!" When Yan's soldiers heard this, they shouted, "What are we waiting for?"

    各地蒋军逃亡日众
    【新华社陕北十一日电】人民解放军胜利挺进声中，各地蒋军下级官兵纷纷逃亡。原有七百多人的阎军七十三师二一八团（原驻介休）已跑掉四百余人。解县解放后，阎锡山去年在解县、安邑一带所抓之一千八百名新兵，已逃亡殆尽。洪洞、赵城等地阎军在家属唤子弟回家运动下，均纷纷携械逃亡。泰安战役歼灭蒋军七十二师全部后，济南新编七十三军（按此为七十三军三个师于莱芜战役中全部覆没后，蒋介石以地方武装及抓丁所重新凑成者），七十七师，一天内即逃亡七十多名。于莱芜战役已跑掉大部之淄博新编第二营所仅余的一个机枪连，已扫数跑光。苏北人民解放军反击胡集获胜后，胡集蒋军副排长王家泰等乘下乡追埔逃兵之际，投奔解放区。宝应蒋军将士兵整天集中在一起，防止逃亡。叶挺（盐城）蒋军残部天天打背包，等待枪响马上逃走。蒋记“还乡团”挤满埠头，候轮逃往江南。蒋记阜宁司法科长左寄汉，财务科长左铁生等，纷纷要求辞职调往“安全地区”。
    【本报太岳十一日电】平遥、介休、灵石等地阎军“逃风”日烈。据逃出之七十三师二一九团二营五连士兵郭宏通说：“八路军进占霍县城后，我们五连原有七八十人，几天功夫就跑得只剩二三十人”。又驻介休安天村六九师二一七团新兵吕育杰、胡守仁说：“我们是永济张营河村人，今年二月被抓来的，阎锡山在我县抓了两千四百余人，都编了预备兵，现在跑的只剩五六百人了，病号就有一百多。每天只发半斤小米，不到一个月已死了三十余人。这几天跑的更多了，我村抓来二十人，已跑了十八人。”阎锡山为了防止士兵逃跑，在军中编成六人小组，一人逃跑，五人挨打，但也无济于事。又驻平遥郝家堡阎军保安十四团二营八连士兵郭胖子说：该团原有千余人，现只剩四五百人。二营原有三百余人，现剩百余人。赵城某农民去阎军那里唤他儿子回家说：“晋南八路军打下十三个县城（按现为十九座县城），你快回家吧！”阎军士兵听了，纷纷喊着“还不走等甚？”
