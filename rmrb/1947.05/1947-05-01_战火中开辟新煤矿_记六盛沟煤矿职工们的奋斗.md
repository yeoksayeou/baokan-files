　　Opening a New Coal Mine Amidst the Flames of War
    A Record of the Struggles of the Workers of the Liushenggou Coal Mine
    Han Guojun
    When the Chiang army invaded Guantai last November, the workers of the Liuhe Coal Mine, with the direct help of the company, moved to the Liushenggou area. In order to solve the livelihood of some workers, increase the wealth of the liberated area, and support the war, a new well was opened in Liushenggou. The workers were united in their struggle to build a "Little Liuhegou."
    At the beginning, they used manpower to push carts to dig the well and drain water. After two months of effort, they reached a depth of fifteen zhang and saw a small amount of coal, with a coal seam height of two chi four cun. In order to mine large coal, they dug another five zhang deeper. According to the old coal master Wu Shouxiang's survey, digging another five or six chi deeper would reveal the main seam, exposing large coal that could be used to produce blue coke.
    This mine was entirely born in the War of Patriotic Defense. The workers, who were used to machines and the life of large companies, struggled against the barren mountains. There were many moving scenes among them.
    Fighting Water
    On February 19th, during well digging, the water that seeped from the sand and stone hindered the work in the well. The cart pushing work was immediately changed from three eight-hour shifts to two large shifts, led by the heroes of the picket team Yang Yanggui, model worker Zhao Qingliu, and comrade Wu Huairen. Their slogan was: "Resolutely fight against the water, we must be as good as a small water pump!" From afar, you could hear their cheers and the rumbling of the carts. In the freezing weather, they worked bare-armed, covered in sweat. They understood that fighting against water was the same as fighting against Chiang Kai-shek. If they didn't resolutely defeat it, they couldn't see large coal, burn coke, and supply it for the manufacture of machines and weapons. After issuing the challenge, the rate of water removal increased from 25 bags per hour to 39 bags, and at most reached 41 bags. To put it in terms of walking: this is equivalent to twelve people carrying a weight of 650 kilograms per hour, walking 14 li. How intense the labor! They persevered automatically. After three days, the water gradually subsided, and the struggle finally won.
    Burning Lime
    A large amount of lime was needed to build the well lining and stabilize the boiler. Getting it from three li away was neither timely nor cheap, and the price was high. At this time, the comrades of the picket team proposed to find local villagers for guidance and burn it themselves near the wellhead. Every day, early and late, you could see comrades picking stones on the river beach. Comrade Yang Yanggui used a hammer as big as a human head to knock stones. Now the second kiln of lime is about to be fired. The first kiln alone produced a value of 370,000 yuan, saving the public expenditure of 170,000 yuan.
    Pulling the Boiler
    The boiler (six sections) was pulled from the ×× River, a distance of about twelve li. After the masters estimated in advance that about 70 people would need 20 days to pull it to the wellhead, 50 people pulled it in 8 days. The efficiency exceeded the original budget by more than 65%; the expenditure saved 920 workdays, equivalent to 2,900 jin of rice. Moreover, the boiler was installed 12 days earlier. The success of this work was due to:
    First, the comrades of the picket team took the lead in uniting the masses.
    Second, good organization, according to the strength of the labor and the level of technology, appropriate specific division of labor.
    Third, technical research at any time, studying how to use force when turning and going up and down slopes. The workers worked together to get the boiler installed as soon as possible.

　　战火中开辟新煤矿
    记六盛沟煤矿职工们的奋斗
    韩国俊
    去年十一月蒋军侵占观台时，六河煤矿职工，在公司的直接帮助之下，转移到六盛沟一带。为了解决部分职工生活并增加解放区财富，支援战争，就在六盛沟开辟了新井，职工们一致为着建立“小六河沟”而奋斗。
    开始用人力推车打井排水，经两个月的努力，打至十五丈深的样子便见小煤，煤头有二尺四寸高。为了采掘大煤又往下打了五丈，据吴守香老煤师勘察，再打五、六尺深揭开了大盖，就露出可以炼青焦的大煤来。
    这个矿厂，完全是在爱国保田战争中生长出来的，由用惯机器，过惯大公司生活的职工们，对着荒山奋斗，其中实有许多动人的场面。
    斗水
    二月十九日凿井中，从沙石上增加出的水，妨碍了井下工作。推车工作当即改三八小班为两大班，由纠察队英雄杨羊贵、模范赵清流及吴怀仁同志负责带领工作。大家的口号是：“坚决与水作斗争，要顶一个小汽泵”。离老远便听到他们的欢呼，和车子辘辘声，在冰冷的天气里赤着臂膀冒着满头大汗的干。他们懂得与水作斗争和与蒋介石作斗争一样，非坚决斗垮他不能见大煤、烧焦炭，供给制造机器和武装的应用，提出挑战后，推水由一小时推二十五包增至三十九包，最多时竟达四十一包。拿走路来说明：这等于十二个人每小时负担重量六百五十公斤，走十四里路，你看多么强烈的劳动！这样自动地坚持干下去，三日之后水势渐小，斗争终于胜利了。
    烧石灰
    砌井筒稳锅炉，需用大批石灰，得到三里地以外去买，既不及时，又得一笔脚费，价格也高。这时纠察队的同志们便提出在当地找老乡指导，在井口附近自己来烧。每天起早搭黑，都看见同志们在河滩担拣石头。杨羊贵同志拿着人头大的铁锤敲石头，现在第二窑灰快要出窑了，单第一窑灰，就生产了价值三十七万元，节省公家开支十七万元。
    拉锅炉
    锅炉（六节）是由××河拉来的，经过路程约十二里。事前经师傅们预算约有七十个人拉二十天即可拉到井口，结果五十个人拉了八天便拉到了，在效率上超过了原预算的百分之六十五强；在开支上节省了九百二十个工，合米二千九百斤。而且使锅炉稳装提早十二天。这个工作成绩的了得，是由于：
    第一、纠察队同志们积极带头团结群众。
    第二、组织的好，根据劳力的强弱，技术的高低适当的具体分工。
    第三、随时研究技术，在拐弯上下坡时，都研究力量如何使用。职工一齐动手，使锅炉早日装上。
