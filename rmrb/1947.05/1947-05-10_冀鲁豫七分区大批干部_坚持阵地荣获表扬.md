Jilu豫 News Agency, 8th. The 7th District Committee of Jilu豫 recently issued a circular commending the heroic models who have persisted in guerrilla warfare over the past two months. The circular is as follows: The Jining County Committee has been tense and active in the war environment, showing a good combat style; When the main force of the enemy set up a temporary stronghold in Daimiao in late March, the Kunshan Eighth District Committee, without the leadership of the county party committee, fought independently, persisted in the area, divided the cadres and militia of the whole district into three groups, flexibly concentrated and dispersed, suppressed special agents, carried out work, and timely grasped the militia education and consolidated their own ranks; Comrade Huang Tianming, Secretary of the Jibei County Committee, has been leading the county armed forces to operate between Wen and Ji since the end of February when the enemy invaded Wenshang City; Comrade Li Xuezhi, Secretary of the Wenshang County Committee, usually cares about the armed forces and controls the troops. After the enemy occupied Wenshang City, when the masses were in emotional turmoil, they were still able to calmly grasp the thinking of the cadres, overcome right-leaning emotions, take the lead in activities, control the landlords, and lead the masses to struggle; Comrade Zhang Jianting, Minister of Organization of the Dongping County Committee, when the enemy's army entered the country at the end of March, he and Zhao Junqing, the acting secretary of the county government, led the cadres and militia of the Fourth District to turn the enemy's head, and immediately carried out restoration work in the Fourth District, so the situation in the Fourth District was quickly opened; After the situation in the Fourth District stabilized, Comrade Zhang Jianting went to the Second District to organize cadres and militia to conduct activities in the east of Dongping City, taking the lead in capturing special agents. Comrade Zhao Junqing has always been active and responsible in emergency situations. To this end, the District Committee has decided to promote him to a member of the County Committee. A large number of heroes and working models have emerged in Nanwang and Jiaxiang in the guerrilla war. Therefore, we hope that the county and district committees will seize the opportunity to summarize the work in a timely manner and commend the models in order to continue to boost our courage to kill the enemy and make the guerrilla war even better. We must combine with the people to make more contributions.
