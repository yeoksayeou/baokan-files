　　Japanese House of Representatives Election Results Announced
    Okano Susumu, Tokuda, and Others Elected
    Social Democratic Party Becomes Largest Party in Parliament
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th] Comprehensive report: The results of the Japanese general election (House of Representatives election) held on the 25th of this month have been announced. Due to the unity of democratic forces, the Japanese Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party cooperated in some respects to overcome various difficulties arranged by the reactionaries. The Social Democratic Party finally won 143 seats, becoming the largest party in the next parliament. JCP leaders Nozaka Tetsuzo (Okano Susumu), Tokuda Kyuichi, and others have also been elected. The Japanese reactionaries, supported by the US occupation authorities, claimed before the election that they would achieve a "complete victory" and that the "Liberal" party would still occupy the highest position in the House of Representatives. This beautiful hope, along with all the conspiracies and tricks they played in the election, was shattered by the merciless facts.

　　日本众院选举结果揭晓
    冈野进德田等当选
    社会民主党成议会中第一大党
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】综合报导：本月二十五日日本大选（众议院选举）的结果已经揭晓。由于民主力量的团结，日共与社会民主党在若干方面协同克服反动派所安排的种种困难，社会民主党终于获得了一百四十三席，而成为下届议会中的第一大党。日共领袖野坂铁（冈野进）、德田球一等亦已当选。在美占领当局支持下的日本反动派，选举前曾扬言将取得“完全胜利”，“自由”党仍将占众院的最高地位。这个美妙的希望，连同他们在选举中所玩弄的一切阴谋诡计，是一并为无情的事实所粉碎了。
