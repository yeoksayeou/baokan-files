　　Quliudian in Puyang County Implements Large-Scale Labor Exchange
    Spring Plowing and Land Distribution Carried Out Simultaneously
    [This newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 12th] Quliudian village in Puyang County organized large-scale mutual aid to complete spring plowing. This village has more than 130 households. The land reform has not yet been completed. Spring plowing has arrived, and the stretcher teams haven't returned. The village also has to hold a district-wide farmer's congress and a women's congress, and several tasks have to be completed at the same time. The village cadres gathered the masses to discuss, and everyone said: "These are all our own important matters, and the tasks must be completed. Let's combine people and divide them into shifts to do it." So they proposed that more than 60 people go to the district to attend the congress, and the remaining farmer's association and militia members organized five spring plowing brigades, each with 20 people, one plow and one harrow. The militia also organized one plow and one harrow, and children under the age of fourteen also organized two harrows. They were weak and only harrowed without plowing. Twenty-four teams of livestock were organized, with one person in charge of each team, specializing in plowing the land. Everyone worked together with high enthusiasm and great efficiency. They completed more than eight hectares of land in three days. Everyone's land was taken care of. The sisters' corps and children's corps members under the age of fourteen and the elderly took care of the house and kept watch. Because they were organized, divided responsibilities, implemented large-scale mutual aid, and carried out various tasks simultaneously, they all did well and completed them quickly.

　　濮县曲六店大变工
    春耕分田同时进行
    【本报冀鲁豫十二日电】濮县曲六店组织大互助完成春耕。该村是一百三十多户的村庄，土地改革还没完成，春耕来到，担架出发未回，村里又要开全区农民大会和妇女大会，同时要完成几件任务。全村干部就召集群众商量，大家说：“这都是咱自己要紧的事，任务都得完成，把人并起来分开班做吧。”于是提出六十多人到区开大会，其余农会、自卫队员组织五个春耕大队，每队廿人，一犁一耙。民兵也组织一犁一耙，十四岁以下的儿童也组织起来两个耙，他们力小光耙不犁。牲口组织起来二十四犋，每犋一人管，专犁地。大伙一齐干热情高，效率大，三天完成八顷多地。谁家地都弄好了。姐妹团及十四岁以下的儿童团员与老人看家放哨。由于他们组织起来，分工负责，实行大互助，各项任务同时进行，都干得好，完成得快。
