Left-wing Fourth District Emergency Drought Prevention: Branch Committee Secretary Takes the Lead in Planting
[This newspaper, Left-wing News] After the emergency mobilization meeting for drought prevention and crash planting held by district and village cadres in the Matian Joint Defense Area of the Fourth District on May 6th, the ideological obstacles of waiting for rain and the idea that there was more wheat land and less empty land, and that planting would not be a problem, were broken; all able-bodied and semi-able-bodied laborers were organized, and cadres took the lead in crash planting. Comrade Ma, the secretary of the Fourth District Branch Committee, first led a group to carry water and planted two mu in one day, influencing the masses to move into action. Before May 12th, 301 mu of cotton had been planted by carrying water. The First Mutual Aid Team responded to the call to fight against the spring drought and crash plant, and conducted group discussions and deliberations. It was found that the masses generally believed that the season was early, that there was little dry land, and that planting would not be a problem when it rained. Labor hero Wang Zhirong said: "Ideological work must be done well, and the passive idea of waiting and thinking that there will be no problem must be broken. Everyone must mobilize and organize all their strength to rush into the fields to make a breakthrough." Then he put forward the idea that "cotton planted at the Beginning of Summer can be harvested, cotton planted at the Grain Full cannot be taken home. Planting early means growing well," breaking the waiting mentality. The "no problem" mentality was also broken by using accounting methods. After the negative thoughts were resolved, everyone agreed that planting cotton was very important, clarified the direction, and inspired everyone's enthusiasm. The whole team of ten groups, fifty-five households, planned to plant thirty-five mu of cotton. The whole team had twenty-three livestock, forty-two male laborers, and all old men, children, and women participated in the labor, each with their own division of labor, and all were involved in the movement, with great enthusiasm. They completed the plan in seven days and exceeded it by sixteen mu. During the movement, Wang Zhirong took the lead in carrying water and planting one mu of cotton, influencing the second group. All six families in the group also planted five and two-tenths mu at the same time. Now all the seedlings have emerged, and everyone happily said: "If Zhirong hadn't pushed us, we wouldn't have been able to plant. The hero is our leader!" Old man Peng Shuangxi, fifty-two years old, was very active in the third group. He said: "There is great strength in organization. As long as everyone takes action, crash planting will not be a problem!" Peng Shuangxi personally carried water to plant cotton, which also inspired everyone's enthusiasm.
