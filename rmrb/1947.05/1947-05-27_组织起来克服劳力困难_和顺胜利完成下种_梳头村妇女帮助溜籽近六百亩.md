　　Organize to Overcome Labor Difficulties
  　Heshun Victoriously Completes Sowing
  　Women of Shutou Village Help with Seeding Nearly Six Hundred Mu

    [Report from this newspaper in Heshun] During the concentrated sowing stage from the end of April to mid-May, the general thinking was still to cultivate crops step by step as in previous years. However, the war support task at the end of April broke the original expectations. Eleven thousand of the better male laborers in the county left. Under such labor shortages, Heshun simultaneously and victoriously completed war support and sowing. The county's 400,000 mu of land were sown on time. Everyone said that although there was less labor this year, the sowing time was the same as in previous years and even more decisive than in previous years. On May 17, two hundred county, district, and village cadres from the entire county held a meeting to summarize the sowing and war support and to deploy weeding work. The main reasons for the smooth and rapid completion of the sowing work were summarized as follows: (1) The leadership proposed organizing women, children, and the elderly to fully participate in production. Some people initially thought it was unreliable, but after discussion, they all agreed that this was the only good solution. Wen Yuan ×× said: "Planting one mu now will yield one shi in the autumn. If you don't move now, you'll hold an empty bowl in the autumn. You can't add a lapel, but you can mend a sleeve. You can't add a jin, but you can add two. People often say: Even a chick weighs four liang." For example, Fang Aizi and Bai Xiaoni of Shutou Village in the Second District led 52 women, carried 740 loads of manure in five days, and helped seed 594 mu, also according to work points. The more they worked, the more motivated they became. Thirty-nine children delivered 864 loads of manure, sowed 446 mu, intercropped 207 mu, and reclaimed 6.5 mu. Children and women ground 900 jie of wheat in two days and also had to deliver the flour to Hebei Village. Bai Xiaoni's planting of grain was even better than that of men. Yan Erni and two others from Boli ground two dou of wheat and one dou of corn in one day and also had to deliver a meal to the fields. A total of 10,294 women, 4,867 children, and 2,764 elderly men in the county were involved in the movement. (2) Labor was used in a unified and rational manner, making the best use of talent. The use of differential tickets and work tickets was unified, orderly, simple, and easy to calculate, giving full play to everyone's enthusiasm. For example, eight old men in Wenquan cultivated land with the same work points as strong young men. Yang Guangzhan of Gaoqiu calculated all the land and labor in the village to see how much labor was needed and how many days it would take to complete. He divided the stages. Before Gaoqiu participated in the war, each person averaged more than five mu; after the war, each person averaged 21.5 mu. Due to unified use, labor and time were not wasted. When planting, they planted together, quickly and early. In the Huchuan Shi Shennian mutual aid group, three of the three laborers from three households left. Only one person and his wife, Xie Yinglian, took a child. They went in the morning and returned at night. Now one family is planting 51 mu of land for three families. (3) Organizations and schools organized sowing shock brigades to help in the countryside. With sowing imminent after the war participants left, all organizations, except for a few cadres who stayed at home to persist in their work, went to the countryside to help and lead sowing. More than 300 students from the First, Second, Third, and Fourth Higher Schools and Cadre Schools also organized sowing shock brigades under the leadership of teachers to help the masses with sowing. Students carried stretchers and did propaganda and mobilization work. (4) Commendations for meritorious service combined with the encouragement of confidence in the victory of the front and rear. Bai Gao launched a challenge when the war participants left. Encouraged by the victory news, Fan Liuhaizi said: "As long as the front wins the battle, we will be happy to die." In the past, they planted more than 20 mu of grain per day; now they plant more than 30 mu per day. Qin ××, a demobilized soldier from Dongdong Nao Rong, did not need anyone to cultivate his three households' 30 mu of land. He said: "I didn't make meritorious service in the army, but I will make meritorious service this time." Children in Hengling collectively filled every household's water vat, freeing up labor for use in the fields. An old man in Wenquan took five children, bought ten yuan of candy, and placed it in the center of the field. Whoever intercropped first got to eat it. They intercropped eight mu of stubble in one morning. (Gui Lin, Zhi Yuan, Shi Chang, Gui De)

　　组织起来克服劳力困难
  　和顺胜利完成下种
  　梳头村妇女帮助溜籽近六百亩
    【本报和顺讯】四月底到五月半的突击下种阶段中，一般人思想上存在仍和往年一样按步就班的养种，可是四月底有了参战任务，打破了原来的预料，全县较好的男劳力走了一万一千人，在这样的劳力缺乏的情形下，和顺的参战与播种已同时胜利完成。全县四十万亩土地都按时下种完了，都说今年虽然劳力少了，但下种时间与往年一样，比往年还来得干脆。五月十七日，全县县区村干部二百余人开会，总结播种参战，布置锄苗工作。总结下种工作能加此顺利迅速完成的主要原因是：（一）领导上提出了组织妇女儿童老汉全力参加生产，开头有的人认为恐怕靠不住，经讨论后，都承认只有这才是唯一的好办法。温源××说：“现在栽一亩，秋天收一石，现在不动弹，秋天端空碗。不能添襟也能补个袖，不能添斤也能添两，人常说：小鸡还有四两重”。如二区梳头村房爱子、白小妮，领导五十二个妇女，五天担粪七百四十担，帮助溜籽五百九十四亩，也是按活评分，越干越有劲；三十九个儿童送粪八百六十四担，下种四百四十六亩，搭茬二百零七亩，开荒六亩半。儿童妇女两天磨九百介麦子，还要把面送到河北村。白小妮种谷比男人还强。泊里阎二妮三人一天磨二斗小麦一斗玉茭，还要往地里送一回饭。全县妇女一万零二百九十四个、儿童四千八百六十七个、老汉二千七百六十四个，都卷入了运动。（二）统一合理使用劳力，做到才尽其用；统一使用差票与工票，有条不乱省事又好算账，发挥了每个人的积极性。如温泉八个老汉耕地评分与壮年一样，高邱杨光占把全村土地劳力都统一计算了，看共需要多少劳力，几天能完成，划分了阶段，在高邱未参战前每人平均五亩多，参战走后每人就平均二十一亩半，由于统一使用，不浪费劳力和时间，要种一齐挨住种，又快又早。牛川史申年互助组三户三个劳力走了两个，只有一个人与他女人谢英莲带了一个小孩，早上去晚上回来，现一家种了三家地五十一亩。（三）机关学校组织播种突击队下乡帮助。参战走后播种在即，各机关除留少数干部在家坚持工作外，全部下乡帮助和领导播种，一、二、三、四高校和干校的三百余学生也在教员的领导下组织播种突击队下乡帮助群众播种。学生抬担架并且做了宣传鼓动工作。（四）立功表扬结合了前后方胜利信心的鼓舞。白皋在参战人走时进行了挑战，在胜利消息的鼓舞下樊六孩说：“只要前方打胜仗，咱们受死也高兴。”过去每日种谷二十余亩，现在每日种三十余亩，东东瑙荣退军人秦××三户三十亩地不用代耕，他说：“在部队没立下功，我这次也要立功。”横岭儿童集体把每家水瓮都担满，这样挤出劳力运用到地里。温源一个老汉带五个儿童，买十元钱糖放在地中央，谁先搭了谁先吃，一上午搭八亩茬。（桂林、志远、世昌、贵德）
