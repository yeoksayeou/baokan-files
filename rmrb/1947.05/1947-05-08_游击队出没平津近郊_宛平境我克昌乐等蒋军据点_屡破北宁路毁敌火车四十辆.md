Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th: Guerrillas are active in the suburbs of Peiping and Tientsin. In mid-April, guerrillas from Wanping, Liangxiang, Daxing, and other counties ambushed the Peiping-Liaoning Railway several times, destroying forty enemy trains. Under the political offensive of the guerrillas, 130 members of the puppet "Lian Zhuang Hui" from the Chiang Kai-shek army stronghold in Panggezhuang, 50 miles south of Peiping, fled. In the past half-month, the Pingxi guerrillas have fought more than 40 battles, killing, wounding, and capturing more than 150 Chiang Kai-shek troops and puppet soldiers. They captured two strongholds, Luogangling and Changle (both belonging to Wanping County), 60 miles from Pingxi, and captured four Chiang Kai-shek army trucks loaded with military supplies near Liulihe. The Tianjin Southern Working Team raided Liyuan, five miles from Tianjin, and captured Guo Qi and his son, the heads of the puppet village security force. In the past month, the local armed forces in this area have sabotaged the railway five times, collected more than 15,000 catties of electric wire, 150 sleepers, and dismantled several sections of rails, forcing the enemy to suspend traffic for several days. In addition, the local armed forces in Cangxian County have fought seven battles along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway in the past month, annihilating 171 Chiang Kai-shek puppet county police corps captain Liu Zhongxing and others. Consequently, more than 200 members of the Chiang Kai-shek puppet self-defense corps at Yao Guantun Station fled on the night of April 2nd.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 6th: In the last ten days of last month, the four divisions of the Chiang Kai-shek army's 94th Army, 121st Division, and others, attempting to reinforce Shizhuang from Baoding, remained hesitant and were blocked by the People's Liberation Army north of Wangdu. Zhangdeng, Fangshunqiao, Qingliangcheng and other places (all located thirty to forty miles south of Baoding) which had been invaded by the enemy on the 25th and 30th, were recovered by the People's Liberation Army on the 1st. At 3:00 PM on the 2nd, in order to cover up their failure to invade southward, the enemy, led by Mu Tingfang, the commander of the 94th Army, launched a sneak attack into Gaoyang County in central Hebei with three divisions, namely the 121st Division, the 116th Division, and the 130th Division of the 53rd Army. They were driven out by the Central Hebei People's Liberation Army in less than an hour, and fled back to Taizhuang and Yangqiao areas south of Baoding in disgrace. In this battle, more than 260 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers were killed or captured.
