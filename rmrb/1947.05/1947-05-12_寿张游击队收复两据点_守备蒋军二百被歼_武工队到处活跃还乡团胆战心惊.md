[This dispatch from our newspaper's Hebei-Shandong-Henan bureau on the 10th] The Shou Zhang guerrilla force recovered the two strongholds of Zhaogudui and Mohumiao on the 1st. All of the Chiang troops garrisoning these strongholds, numbering over 200 men with their weapons, were captured. The guerrilla force only suffered two casualties. The surrounding "Homecoming Legions" fled in panic upon hearing the news. In addition, local armed work teams have become increasingly active recently. After the victories in Zhang Yangwang and Chenji, the 6th District's armed work team has increased its membership by one and a half times. The masses near the Chiang troops' strongholds all provide intelligence to the armed work team. On April 10th, the puppet district headquarters and a part of the puppet "Ganzihui" were stationed in Yangcheng, 5th District. Before they could gain a foothold, twenty members of the armed work team infiltrated Yangcheng that night, shouting slogans and firing guns, causing great chaos among the enemy and puppets. The "Ganzihui" scattered and fled that night, and the puppet district headquarters withdrew in panic. On the 26th, the armed work team ambushed at three locations: Luhutong, Wangtielu, and Zengnali. On that day, a Chiang army company, in coordination with the puppet district headquarters and a part of the "Ganzihui," totaling approximately 200 men, set out at dawn, attempting to loot grain from Yangji. The armed work team calmly ambushed them. The sharpshooter Hu Anmin discovered the enemy's command position and killed the commander with a single shot. A unit ambushing at Wangtielu, hearing the gunfire, rushed to the scene and attacked from the flank. The enemy, unable to withstand the assault, scattered and fled in all directions. It is estimated that fourteen enemy soldiers, including the company commander, were killed or wounded. Having repeatedly suffered ambushes and attacks from the armed work team, the enemy and puppets are now on edge and dare not engage in activities.

　　寿张游击队收复两据点
    守备蒋军二百被歼
    武工队到处活跃还乡团胆战心惊
    【本报冀鲁豫十日电】寿张游击队于一日收复赵固堆、墨虎庙两据点，守备蒋军全部人枪各二百余，均被俘获，游击队仅伤亡二人，附近“还乡团”闻风纷纷逃窜。此外，当地武工队近来益形活跃。六区武工队在张仰望、陈集胜利后，队员扩大一倍半，凡在蒋军据点附近群众，均为武工队送情报。四月十日伪区部和伪“杆子会”一部，驻五区杨城，立脚未稳，当夜武工队二十人即摸进杨城内，喊话打枪，敌伪大乱，“杆子会”当夜跑散，伪区部仓惶撤走。二十六日武工队设伏于陆胡同、王铁炉及曾那里三处，是日蒋军一个连配合伪区部和“杆子会”一部约二百余名，于拂晓出发，企图到杨集抢粮，武工队沉着伏击，神枪手胡安民发觉敌人指挥位置，一枪即将该指挥官击毙。设伏于王铁炉之一部，闻枪声赶来，从侧面袭击，敌不支四散逃奔，计毙伤敌连长以下十四名。敌伪屡遭武工队设伏、袭击，已提心吊胆，不敢活动。
