　　The Growing Strength of the Indian Proletariat
    By Soviet Journalist Yevgeny Zhukov
    (TASS Moscow dispatch) Yevgeny Zhukov, a well-known Soviet journalist (and member of the Soviet delegation to the Pan-Asian Conference) who recently visited India, recently published his impressions of his visit in Pravda. He wrote:
    In the larger towns of India such as Delhi, Calcutta, and Bombay, which the Soviet delegation visited, we encountered curfews announced by the authorities in certain areas, banning pedestrians at night. The frequent conflicts between Hindus and Muslims were used as a pretext for these curfews. These conflicts often take the form of ambushes, sniper attacks, or individual killings. Sometimes, frenzied mobs, incited by certain sinister figures, break into the homes of their "enemies," killing everyone around and destroying and burning everything in sight, committing acts of rare cruelty. From a conversation with a high-ranking government official in one of India's major provinces, we understood the essence of these tragic events. This official frankly told the Soviet delegation that "fortunately," most of those who died in the Hindu-Muslim conflicts were from the poor classes, poor people killing poor people. This provincial administrator said with a look of fear: What changes would occur in the overall situation if the rich became the targets of attack! This visit gave us a deep impression that the British-Indian local authorities never intended to take any measures to oppose those who instigated the massacres that repeatedly occurred in various corners of the region. But who used the riffraff to incite the poor against the poor? They are the ones who seek excuses to justify the presence of British troops on Indian territory; those who fear the masses and try to divert them from the struggle for their fundamental interests; those who brutally exploit the working people to consolidate their reactionary rule. Zhukov continued: "Modern India is a huge, backward agricultural country, shackled by the chains of extreme backwardness by British imperialism's rule. You can see traces of backwardness in everything, from the use of primitive agricultural tools to the archaic dogmas that seek protection for backwardness. On the other hand, in the same era in India, new and progressive social forces can also be found with similar views. During the Second World War, the Indian working class has grown in both quality and quantity. Indian workers are forever firmly resisting the exploiting classes and all efforts to confine them to the miserable life of a poor colony. We saw the port of Calcutta, where dockworkers were on strike, with a large number of ships lying idle and motionless. Shipowners are calculating their losses, but still hope that poverty will break the will of the strikers. The dockworkers persisted in their strike, and the workers have an unwavering spirit. The Indian proletariat not only exists, but is increasingly becoming a permanently important factor in Indian political life. No wonder this has become a matter of deep concern for some people in India. We saw many speakers at gatherings in India declare themselves to be ardent supporters of socialist ideals. We will never forget the passionate display of confidence and devotion to the Soviet state and Marshal Stalin. We have seen this sign more than once in India, especially when we meet with workers and students. When the Soviet representatives traveled by train from Delhi to Agra to visit the famous Indian architectural monuments, two stops before their destination, the representatives' carriage was crowded with local young people who came to pay their respects to the guests. A marching crowd holding red flags gathered at the destination train station, so perplexing the local stationmaster, who later invited the Soviet representatives to rest in a room in the train station and locked the door until the marching crowd dispersed. In many cases, we saw Indians react eagerly when they heard that there was no racial oppression, no ethnic conflict, and no religious fanaticism in the Soviet state. The hereditary class system is the most terrible obstacle to Indian society, but some people benefit greatly from it. I only need to say the following fact to make it clear. The low wages of certain types of workers is a reflection of wages based on class. Workers belonging to the lower classes, no matter how skilled they are, can only get a very small wage for their labor. The hereditary class system is essential for those who need to use social barriers to consolidate their rule. We not only saw the terrible impoverished "untouchable" (i.e. pariah class) residential areas, which were all small houses covered with rusty lead sheets, but still had to pay rent to the ruthless landlords. We not only saw naked teenagers and semi-naked adult men and women who had no clothes to cover their bodies. We also saw some other things. We learned that many of these poor people have heard that in the distant north there is a "strange country" where there is no hereditary class system, where all people are equal, and that is the country of Lenin. We saw red flags in the "untouchable" residential areas of Bombay, and we will never forget how easy it was to connect with the people there. When shaking hands with the Soviet people, tears of joy welled up in the eyes of our "untouchable" hosts.

### 印度无产阶级力量与日俱增

　　印度无产阶级力量与日俱增
    苏联记者叶夫根尼·朱可夫
    塔斯社莫斯科讯：著名的苏联新闻记者叶夫根尼·朱可夫（系出席泛亚洲会议苏联代表团之一员）新近曾拜访过印度，顷在真理报发表其观光印象。他写道：
    在苏联代表团所参观过的印度的德里、加尔各答及孟买一带的较大城镇中，我们在某些地区遇到当局宣布的晚间禁绝行人的戒严令。印回的经常冲突，成为这种戒严的口实。这些冲突常常出以埋伏、狙击的方式或个别杀害，有时疯狂的暴民为某些阴险的人物所鼓动，破门进入他的“敌人”家里，杀死周围每一个人，捣毁与烧掉所有的东西，做出了罕见的暴虐行为。从与印度某主要省份之某政府高级官吏谈话中，我们明白了这些悲剧事件的本质。这位官吏坦白的告诉苏联代表团说：“幸运的”是在印回冲突里牺牲的大部是贫穷阶级，穷人杀穷人。这位省行政官吏带着恐惧的表情说：假如富人变成了被攻击的目标时，全面形势将要起如何的变化啊！这一次的访问使我们得一深刻的印象，英印地方当局是永远不想采取任何办法去反对屡次在各个地区的角落里发生的屠杀的背后唆使者。但是是谁当了流氓们去鼓动穷人反对穷人？他们就是那些找寻借口辩护英国军队留驻印度领土内的人；就是害怕群众而企图把他们从为自己的基本利益的斗争中引导开去的人；就是那些残酷剥削劳动人民以巩固他们的反动统治的人。朱可夫继续写道：“现代印度是一个巨大的落后的农业国家，被英国帝国主义的统治用极端落后者锁链把手足锁住了。你可以从每一件事里看到落后的痕迹，从使用原始的农具，以至为落后找寻保护的极古式的教条。在另一方面，在同一时代的印度里，也可以找到新的进步的社会力量同观点。在世界第二次大战中，印度工人阶级已经在质与量上有了成长，印度工人们永远坚决地去抵抗剥削阶级，想把他们限制在贫穷的殖民地的悲惨生活的一切努力。我们看到了码头工人罢工的加尔各答港口，闲散的无动静的停泊着大量的船只。船主们计算着损失，但是仍旧希望着贫穷将打破罢工者的意志。码头工人们坚持着罢工，工人们有着坚定不移的精神。印度的无产阶级不仅存在了，而且与日俱增的变成印度政治生活中永远的主要的因素。无怪乎这变成了印度某些人士深刻忧虑的事情。我们在印度看到很多集会中的演讲者都宣称他们自己是社会主义理想的热烈的拥护者。我们将永远忘记不了激情的显示对苏维埃国家及斯大林元帅的信心与虔敬，我们在印度不止一次的看到这种迹象，尤其当我们与工人同学生相遇的时候。当苏联代表们从德里乘火车到阿格拉去参观著名的印度建筑的纪念物时，还离目的地两站时，代表乘坐的车箱中就挤满了当地的青年，他们是来向客人们致敬的。游行群众手执红旗集聚在目的地火车站中，如此困惑了当地火车站长，他后来邀请苏联代表们到火车站的一间房子里休息，并且把门锁了起来，一直等到游行群众散去后。在很多场合里，我们看到印度人当听到在苏维埃国家里没有种族压迫，没有民族冲突，没有宗教的狂热，他们有着热切的反应。世袭的阶级制度是对印度社会的最可怕的障碍，但是却有些人从其中得到不少利益。我只消说下列事实就够了，某几类工人的低工资就是工资在阶级上的反映，属于低级阶层的工人不管如何熟练，他们只能得到自己劳力的极小的工资。世袭阶级制度对于那些人是紧要的，他们需要用社会的障碍去巩固他们的统治。我们不仅看到可怕的贫穷的“不可接触”（即贱民阶级）的居民区，其中都是些用发锈的铅皮盖起来的小屋，但是仍旧要付给无情的地主以租金。我们不仅看到赤裸裸的少年同半裸的成年男女，他们都没有衣服去遮盖他们的身体。我们也还看到别的一些事情。我们得知很多这类贫民都听到过，在遥远的北方有着一个“奇异的国度”，在那里没有世袭阶级制度存在，那里所有人民都是平等的，那就是列宁的国家。我们在孟买的“不可接触”居民区里看到了红旗，而且我们将永不会忘记那里的人们是如何容易接触。与苏联人民握手时，在我们“不可接触”的主人的眼里激起了欢喜的眼泪。
