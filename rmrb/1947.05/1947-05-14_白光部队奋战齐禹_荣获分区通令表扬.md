　　[This newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 12th dispatch] Bai Guang, a combat hero who is famous in Tai-Xi and well-known in Ji-Lu-Yu, led his troops during the Anti-Japanese War, frequently ambushing enemy and puppet strongholds, repeatedly striking the enemy, and establishing great achievements. He was elected as a top enemy-killing hero at the Ji-Lu-Yu District mass meeting. After the Chiang army occupied Qi-Yu, he led the local armed work team to fiercely attack the enemy, fighting tirelessly to protect the people of Qi-Yu. On March 31st, in Huangcun Village, Fifth District of Qi-Yu, they cooperated with the Ninth District Team to strike the "Homecoming Corps" who came out of Qi-Yu City to loot grain. The enemy scurried south like rabbits, and they chased them all the way to the turbulent Yellow River bank, resulting in the annihilation of seven enemies and the seizure of six long and short guns. At dawn on April 2nd, more than 150 enemies from Nangujia Village, carrying three machine guns, came to Nixing Village to rape and plunder. Bai Guang's troops arrived. Although the enemy had already left the village at that time, Bai Guang's troops ambushed them head-on in the northwest corner of Sutun, waiting for the enemy. After a while, more than a hundred enemies came with looted goods. Our troops suddenly rushed up with a grenade, and the enemy collapsed in disarray. In addition to returning five carts full of the masses' property to the masses, we also liberated more than 20 masses, captured two enemies, seized two large guns, the enemy abandoned four corpses (including one company commander), and six were injured. We only suffered one minor injury. On the night of the 3rd, the enemy's township public bureau team and part of the ×× Brigade attempted to extinguish our Liuqi Village militia. When the enemy approached the militia's housing, Bai Guang's troops immediately launched an attack in separate routes, encountering the enemy head-on. Although everyone had been fighting for several days and was extremely tired, they still pounced on the enemy like hungry tigers, fighting courageously. The enemy abandoned their corpses and fled. We killed or wounded six enemies and captured one enemy. In this battle, when approaching the enemy, Comrade Bai Guang personally led the communicators in the charge. He encountered three tall and strong enemies head-on. Under the starlight, they wrestled with the enemies. The communicator was knocked down by the enemy's gun butt. He was left alone to fight with three strong enemies. Before long, a squad came up and drove the enemy away. Bai Guang had just breathed a sigh of relief when he saw an enemy tripped. He quickly pounced on him, grabbed the enemy's neck, and took off a large gun with eighteen bullets. In three battles, a total of twenty-six enemies were annihilated, and nine rifles were seized. Bai Guang's troops' achievements in these three battles were commended by the Sixth Sub-District Command of Ji-Lu-Yu, and the Qi-Yu Armed Work Team was renamed the "Bai Guang Unit."

　　白光部队奋战齐禹
    荣获分区通令表扬
    【本报冀鲁豫十二日电】威震泰西名扬冀鲁豫的战斗英雄白光，抗日战争时代曾率领部队出没敌伪据点之间，屡次打击敌人，建立大功，曾在冀鲁豫区群众大会上被选为头等杀敌英雄。蒋军进占齐禹后，他又在当地带领武工队狠命打击敌人，为保卫齐禹人民奋战不息。三月三十一日，在齐禹五区黄存庄配合九区队打击齐禹城出来抢粮的“还乡团”，敌人像兔子一样往南窜，他们一直追到波涛汹涌的黄河岸边，结果歼敌七名，缴长短枪六枝。四月二日拂晓，南顾家沟敌人一百五十余，带机枪三挺到倪幸庄奸淫抢掠，白光部队赶至，当时敌人虽已出庄，但白光部队迎头埋伏在肃屯西北角，等候敌人。一会，敌百余带着掠夺物品过来，我部突然一个手榴弹直冲上去，敌人狼狈溃散，我除将满载群众财物的大车五辆归还群众外，并解放群众二十余名，俘敌二名，缴大枪二支，敌弃尸四具（内连长一名），伤六名，我仅轻伤一名。三日夜，敌乡公局队和××大队一部，企图扑灭我刘淇村民兵，当敌人逼进民兵住房时，白光部队即分路出击，正和敌人遭遇，大家虽数日转战，极为疲劳，但一见敌人，仍如饿虎扑食，勇猛冲杀，敌弃尸逃窜，我毙伤敌六名，俘敌一名。这次战斗接近敌人时，白光同志亲率通讯员冲锋，迎面碰到三个又高又壮的敌人，星光下和敌人扭成一团，通讯员被敌枪托击倒，剩他一人和三个强敌扭斗，不多时一班上来，把敌打跑。白光刚松口气，见一个敌人绊倒，他飞快扑上去，捏着敌人颈子，摘下大枪一支，子弹十八粒。三次战斗计歼敌二十六名，缴步枪九支。白光部队此三次的战绩，获得冀鲁豫六分区司令部通令表扬，并改齐禹武工队为“白光部队”。
