　　The Philippines Also Looks Down on Chiang Kai-shek

Last month, on the 18th, the Chiang Kai-shek government and the Philippine puppet government of Roxas signed the so-called "Sino-Philippine Friendship Treaty." The Chiang government boasted greatly about this, claiming it was a "new era in Sino-Philippine relations" and would have such-and-such influence on "Far Eastern peace," as if it were the same as the so-called "alliance treaty" signed by the traitor Wang Jingwei's government and the puppet Manchukuo's Puyi government. Wang Jingwei also made quite a show of it back then. In fact, the signing of the "Chiang-Philippine Treaty" was entirely orchestrated by the Americans behind the scenes. Besides enabling the two traitors, Chiang and Roxas, to praise each other, the main purpose was to facilitate Chiang Kai-shek's purchase and transport of American military supplies from the Philippines, just as the "Wang-Manchu Treaty" was entirely dictated by the Japanese. It had no independent significance whatsoever.

Judging from the various facts since the signing of the "treaty," the Philippines does not value this so-called "friendship" treaty at all, but is merely going through the motions in accordance with American intentions. Roxas, this double-dealing Philippine traitor, does not hold Chiang Kai-shek in high regard, causing even Central News Agency reporters to feel "indignant."

On the "solemn" day of the signing, only half of the Filipino newspapers published the full text of this "friendship" treaty in the Philippines, and it was placed in unimportant locations. Among them, only one newspaper published a short commentary. There was no atmosphere of celebration at all, which was quite a contrast to the enthusiasm of the Chiang Kai-shek government!

Not only that, but the Philippine government's anti-Chinese actions have increased because of this "friendship." First, regarding the immigration issue, the Philippine government continues to impose even greater restrictions on overseas Chinese. The Philippine government has already forbidden the 7,800 displaced people who were transported back to China by UNRRA ships after the war from returning to the Philippines. The benefits enjoyed by overseas Chinese under the 1940 Immigration Act were declared by the Immigration Bureau on the first day after the signing to be unable to be restored unless Roxas orders otherwise. A week later, when 637 overseas Chinese arrived in Manila, the vast majority of them were subjected to extremely unreasonable abuse and detention. The Philippine government also passed a bill to increase the registration fees for foreigners and a bill to prohibit foreigners (excluding Americans) from applying for licensed pharmacists, both of which aimed to make the livelihoods of the 150,000 overseas Chinese increasingly difficult.

These are Roxas's "friendly" gestures to the Chiang Kai-shek government. On July 14th of last year, at the closing reception at the American Embassy in Nanjing on American Independence Day, Marshall mentioned Chiang Kai-shek and Roxas together in his speech. Many of Chiang Kai-shek's high-ranking lackeys felt deeply honored by this and applauded enthusiastically, as if they were being granted official titles. In reality, Roxas is not even willing to stand on equal footing with Chiang Kai-shek; because the Philippine reactionaries, as American compradors in the Philippines, have been qualified for much longer than Chiang Kai-shek.

### 菲律宾也看不起蒋介石

　　菲律宾也看不起蒋介石
    上月十八日，蒋介石政府与菲律宾罗哈斯傀儡政府签订了所谓“中菲友好条约”，蒋政府曾为此大吹大擂，说什么“中菲关系新纪元”，对于“远东和平”有如何如何影响等，好像过去汉奸汪精卫政府和伪满洲国的溥仪政府订立的所谓“同盟条约”一样，汪精卫也曾煞有介事一番。其实“蒋菲条约”之签订，完全是美国人在后面牵线，目的在使蒋罗两奸互相捧场之外，主要是便利于蒋介石从菲律宾购运美国军火，正如“汪满条约”完全由日本人指使一样，一点自主的意义也没有。
    从签“约”以后的种种事实看来，菲律宾并不重视这个什么“友好”条约，只不过奉行美国意旨敷衍一番而已。罗哈斯这个双料菲奸，并没有把蒋介石放在心上，使中央社记者也感到“愤慨”。
    在签约的“隆重”日子，这个“友好”条约全文全菲律宾只有一半菲文报纸刊载，且登都在不重要的地方，其中又只有一家报纸发表了短评，全无庆祝空气，比起蒋介石政府那股热劲，好不冷淡！
    不仅如此，菲政府之排华行动，反因“友好”而增加。首先是关于移民问题，菲政府继续予华侨以更大之限制，战后由联总船只运送回华之七千八百名难胞，菲政府已不许他们再回菲岛；一九四○年移民法案中华侨已享受之待遇，在签约后第一天，移民局宣布除非罗哈斯另有命令不能恢复；又过一个星期，有六百三十七名华侨至马尼刺，绝大部分华侨受到极端无理之虐待与拘禁，菲政府又通过增加外侨登记费案，及禁止外侨申请执业药剂师案（美侨除外），目的均在使十五万华侨之生计日趋困难。
    这些就是罗哈斯给蒋介石政府的“友好”表现。去年七月十四日，美国独立纪念日，马歇尔在南京美大使馆的结尾酒会上演说，曾把蒋介石与罗哈斯并提，好些蒋介石的高级喽罗们深以为荣，热烈鼓掌，有如封官赐爵。实际上，罗哈斯还不肯与蒋介石立于同等地位；因为菲律宾反动派作美国在菲律宾的买办，比蒋介石的资格老的多。（陕北十五日电）
