　　Medical Worker Zhu Tongyi
	Battalion Commander Li Wenbo
		Finally escaped the tiger's den
　　Zhu Tongyi, a young medical worker from the 213th Unit, was a child from a poor family in Jincheng, Shanxi. He suffered greatly from a young age. At seventeen, he was seized by Yan Xishan to learn bugling. The bugle instructor always disliked him, not allowing him to urinate during the day or sleep at night, forcing him to practice bugling constantly. Because he secretly urinated, he was punished by making him kneel in the sun for half a day with a brick on his head, and he would be slapped for saying anything wrong. Later, he resolved to desert. That night, he crawled out of the machine gun emplacement of Yan's army, thinking he had finally escaped the tiger's den. Who knew that he lost his way and ran to Duancun, where he was caught by Yan's army and made a cook's assistant, enduring beatings and scolding again. During the Shangdang Campaign, our army recovered Duancun, and he followed along. When clearing the prisoners, because he was young, he was told to go home, but he refused at all costs. Only then was he allowed to learn to be a medical worker. At that time, he happily said: "I have finally escaped the tiger's den."
		
		Elected as a Model Four Times
　　Because he was clever and skillful, he became a medical worker in the Eighth Company of the Third Battalion after only a few months of training. He not only achieved great results in hygiene work in the company, but he was also a skilled propagandist. Especially since the Longhai Campaign, he has made many great contributions and was elected as a model worker. However, because of the wartime environment, no meeting was held, so it passed silently. Comrade Zhu Tongyi was not affected at all, and his work was still so energetic. During the battle of Shao'erzhai, he was wounded, but he not only did not leave the front line, but also rescued more than thirty wounded soldiers, and was elected to attend the Model Workers Congress of the 106th Unit. Because the regulations at the time stipulated that each battalion should have one model medical worker and one administrative worker, and his company had a cook, Wu Hequan, and the machine gun company had a medical worker, Qu Yanbin, in order to take care of the unity of the company, he gave up his qualification to Qu Yanbin. But he still did not waver in the slightest, and his work continued to be energetic. After returning from the second Longhai Railway campaign, he was elected as a model for the third time, and only then did he attend the group hero meeting of the regiment and win the title of First-Class Model. Now the entire battalion has elected him as a model to attend the Second Congress of Heroes of the 106th Unit.
		
		A Child's Big Medical Kit
　　He knew that our army's medicine was not easy to obtain, so he was reluctant to waste even a bit of cotton or a piece of gauze. He also often collected local herbs to put in his medical kit. When Jinxiang was besieged, enemy planes sent shells into the city, and many fell on our positions, breaking a lot of them. He dismantled these broken shells and put the white explosives inside into his medical kit. Later, he used these explosives to cure thirty-one scabies patients. When people saw his medical kit, they would say: "Look! The child's big medical kit." Meaning they admired that he could save money and treat illnesses.
		
		On the March
　　When the troops marched towards northern Henan, not a single member of the Eighth Company fell behind. Zhu Tongyi's collecting group was set up at the rear. He always ran back and forth to check, and whenever he found someone showing signs of fatigue, he would carry things for them or tell jokes, in any case, he would not let you fall behind. When they arrived at a place, he wouldn't put down his backpack, but would go to each squad to check the comrades' sleeping positions, whether they had washed their feet. Sometimes he would hold their shoes and socks while they poured out the wash water before he left.
		
		Don't worry, I can do it
　　When the troops were attacking Jixian, our soldiers were on the front line, only having dug a narrow and shallow trench when the enemy began a barrage of fire. At that time, a large man named Guo Migou was seriously injured, and his lying down completely blocked the trench, and the troops could no longer move. It was also getting close to dawn, and the stretcher bearers could not arrive. What could be done? The battalion commander saw Zhu Tongyi administering medicine to him under heavy fire and immediately ordered him: "Medical worker, take him down after you apply the medicine." This stumped him, as Zhu Tongyi, a teenager, even four of him, could not carry this big man, let alone carry him alone in such terrain and under the enemy's fire blockade? But he did not object, and answered very simply: "Yes! I will carry him after I apply the medicine." At this moment, he heard someone shouting from a distance: "Medical worker! Come quickly!" He quickly replied: "I'll be right there!" We didn't see what method he used to carry Comrade Guo Migou down, but we only saw him running back covered in sweat and saying: "Battalion Commander, I carried him down!" As he spoke, he ran towards the direction he was being called, saying as he ran: "Don't worry, I can do it."
		
		Machine gun, come back with me!
　　After dawn, a machine gun was found on the position of the Seventh Company; this was left behind by the Seventh Company when it was ordered to transfer its position to provide cover, and unfortunately the gunner and assistant gunner were killed and lay with the machine gun. The enemy thought they were still alive and concentrated their fire on this location.
　　The machine gun was still more than sixty meters away from our position, across open ground. Who could go and get it without orders? Zhu Tongyi knew that there would be no wounded soldiers at this time, so he jumped out of the trench and ran towards the machine gun. When the enemy saw a barefoot and empty-handed young Eighth Route Army soldier running towards them, they immediately concentrated an even denser barrage of fire on him. All the comrades of the Eighth Company leaned out of their positions, anxiously watching his actions. He crawled closer to the machine gun without panic, then lay down and ran to the front, grabbed the gun handle with his right hand, and shouted, "Come on! Machine gun, come back with me." Under the enemy's increasingly intense barrage of fire, he finally calmly brought the machine gun back.

　　卫生员朱同义
    营长  李文波
            终究逃出了虎口
    二一三部小卫生员朱同义，是山西晋城穷人家的孩子，从小受苦，十七岁时被阎锡山抓去学号兵。那个号长总看他不顺眼，白天不叫他小便，黑夜不叫睡觉，成天成夜的拔号音，因为他偷偷尿了尿，就罚他顶着整砖在太阳地跪了半天，一句话不对劲就得挨嘴巴。后来下决心要开小差。那天黑夜就从阎军重机枪工事的射口钻出来，心想这回可逃出虎口了，谁知道因失了方向跑到段村，被段村的阎军捉住，当了勤务兵，又过起挨打受骂的日子来。上党战役我军收复段村，他就跟了来，清查俘虏时因为他小叫他回家，他长短不肯，才叫他去学卫生员，当时他高兴的说：“我终究逃出虎口来了”。
            四次当选模范
    因为他心灵手巧，只学了几个月就到三营八连任卫生员。他在连上不仅卫生工作有很大的成绩，宣传鼓动也是能手，特别是陇海战役以来，立过很多大功，就当选了模范工作者，可是因为战争环境没有开会，就不声不响的过去了。朱同义同志毫没受到影响，工作还是那么起劲。打邵耳砦他负了伤，他不仅没下火线，还抢救了卅多个彩号，又当选了出席一○六部的模范。因为当时规定模范卫生人员每营一个，事务人员一个，他连有了个炊事员吴何全，机炮连出了卫生员渠炎斌，为了照顾连队团结，就把他的参加资格让给渠炎斌了。可是他仍没有半点波动，工作照常起劲。二下陇海路回来，又当选第三次模范，才出席团的群英大会，获得甲等模范的称号。现在全营又选他为出席一○六部二届群英大会的模范。
            小孩子的大药包
    他知道我军医药来源不易，所以对一点棉花一块盖口布都不舍得浪费；他还时常收集土药装进他的药包里。围困金乡时敌人飞机给城里送炮弹，很多落在我们阵地上，摔坏了不少，他就把这些坏炮弹拆开，把里头的白色炸药装到他药包里，后来用这些炸药治好了三十一个疥号。人们一看到他的药包就说：“看！小孩背的大药包。”意思就是羡慕他又能节省又能治病。
            进军的路上
    部队往豫北开，八连没有一个掉队的。朱同义这个收容组就设在后边。他总是跑来跑去的看，只要发现有人现出疲劳的样子，他就给同志们背东西或是说笑话，反正不能叫你掉下去。到一个地方，他背包不下，就到各班去检查同志们睡觉的位置，是否洗了脚，有时候人家洗脚他抱着鞋袜，等人家泼了洗脚水他才走。
            放心吧，都能办到
    部队打汲县的时候，我们的战士在阵地上，才挖成一个又狭又浅的交通沟，敌人就开始了火力封锁。当时大个子郭密沟同志负了重伤，一躺就把个交通沟塞满了，部队再也不能运动了。天又快明，担架来不到，这可怎么办呢？营长见朱同义冒着稠密的火力给他上药，马上命令他说：“卫生员，上好药你把他背下去”。这下可把他难住了，十几岁的朱同义就有四个，也背不动这个大个子，何况在这样的地形和敌人的火力封锁下叫他一个人背呢？可是他没提意见，很干脆的答道：“是！上好药我就背他”。正在这时候听见很远的地方在喊：“卫生员！快来呀！”他又赶紧答应道：“一下就来！”究竟他那时用什么办法把郭密沟同志背下去的，我们没有看见，只见他满头大汗的跑回来说：“营长，我把他驼下去了！”说着就往喊他的方向跑了去，嘴里还边跑边说着：“放心吧，都能办到”。
            机关枪，跟我回去！
    天明以后，发现七连阵地上一挺机关枪；这是七连奉命转移阵地时留下最后作掩护的，不幸射手和预手都牺牲了，和机关枪躺在一起。敌人以为他们还活着，便集中火力向这里射击。
    机枪离我们的阵地还隔着六十多米远的开阔地，没有命令谁能去拿呢？朱同义知道这会没有彩号，就跳出交通沟，向机关枪跑去。敌人见对面跑来了个赤手空拳的小八路军，立时集中更稠密的火力向他射击。全八连的同志都探出身子，紧张的盯住他的行动。他毫不惊慌的爬近机枪，然后伏下身去跑到跟前，用右手抓住枪提把，一面喊道：“来！机关枪，跟我回去”。在敌人一阵紧似一阵的火力追击下，他终于不慌不忙的把机关枪拿了回来。
