　　Hou Village Elderly Mutual Aid Group
　　In Hou Village, Gaoping, there is a mutual aid group consisting of four people: Gao Sancong, Zhu Yan, Song Youzhen, and Cheng Xiaonv. Gao Sancong is also a military dependent; her son joined the Eighth Route Army. They are all widowed elderly women. Except for Zhu Yan, who is 57 years old this year, the other three are over 60 years old.
　　Last June, these four women first organized themselves to spin cotton to earn wages. By August, they borrowed four jin of cotton from the cooperative and spun yarn to sell themselves. During the mass movement, they were also allocated some fruits of labor, which laid the foundation for them to settle down and turn over a new leaf. The four of them lived together, ate from the same pot, and focused wholeheartedly on spinning cotton. By the end of February this year, after six months, they had earned and saved a total of 30 jin of cotton, 20 zhang (large measure) of cloth, 1.5 dan of rice, 2 dou of corn, and 10 carts of coal (valued at 68,400 yuan at market prices), in addition to living expenses of 48,000 yuan. The total earnings for both expenses and savings amounted to 116,400 yuan. Based on the food expenses for these six months, they achieved "spin one, surplus one," meaning they didn't need to rely on the government or others for their livelihood. The reasons and experiences for their success are as follows:
　　1. They broke away from the mentality of simply relying on government care and others to support them. They said, "The farmers' association helps the people to turn over, but it won't work if they don't produce themselves. It also won't work to rely on children, daughters-in-law, relatives, and friends to support us. It's right to do a little work with our own strength." 2. They recognized that they were old and could only do light labor, and that spinning cotton was a good way. Especially now that spinning cotton is very profitable, so all four of them started by learning to spin cotton. 3. They have perseverance and determination. At the beginning, none of them knew how to spin. When they were learning, they didn't have fuel at home, and especially since they were old, their arms ached after spinning for a while; but they overcame these difficulties. 4. The four of them care for and love each other, and everyone discusses and understands each other's problems. If one person is not in good spirits, the other three will take care of her more. Everyone talks through everything in their hearts, so the four of them are as close as one family. 5. They are diligent and thrifty, and their lives and work are regularized. In the past six months, the four of them have only spent a total of a little over 12 shi of rice on rice, oil, salt, and cloth. They lived very frugally and never spent money recklessly just because they had it. It was stipulated that Zhu Yan was responsible for all outside errands, while the other three were responsible for cooking and other chores. They were required to spin one jin of cotton every day, and go to bed after burning one or two wicks of oil at night. (Zheng Dong)

　　侯村老人互助组
    高平侯村有个互助组共四个人——高三聪、朱眼、宋有珍、程小女。高三聪还是个军属哩，她儿当了八路军。她们都是孤寡老婆，除朱眼今年五十七岁外，其余三人都是六十多岁的人了。
    去年六月，她们四个人，先是组织起来纺花赚工资，到八月就向合作社借了四斤花，自己纺花卖线了。群运中又分给她们一些果实，就打下安家翻身的基础，四个人就住在一起，吃饭也是一锅，心无二用，一心闹纺花。到今年二月底共六个月，先后除过生活开支四万八千元外，共赚存花三十斤、布二十丈（大尺）、米一石五斗、玉茭二斗、煤十车等（按市价值洋六万八千四百元）。开支和存货两宗共赚洋十一万六千四百元。若按这六个月的开支计粮，做到“纺一余一”，生活完全不需依赖公家和别人帮助。她们四个人做的这样好的原因和经验有下列几点：
    一、打破了单纯依靠公家照顾和别人养活的心理。她们说：“农会帮助老百姓翻身，可是光靠农会自己不生产也不行，靠孩儿、媳妇、亲友养活也不行，还是自己有一点力做一点活是个正路”。二、认识到自己年老只能做轻劳动，纺花就是好办法。尤其现在纺花利很大，因此她们四个人一开始就是学纺花。三、有恒心、有毅力。开始时都不会纺，学的时候，家里没烧的，尤其是上年纪了，纺上些时候，胳膊酸痛；但这些困难，她们都克服了。四、她们四个之间相互关照友爱，有事大家检讨和谅解。一个人精神不好，其他三人便来多照顾，大家在心中有些甚话都谈透了，因此她们四个就和一家人一样亲热。五、勤苦节俭，生活工作规律化。她们四人，这半年来米、油、盐、布等统共才开支了十二石多米，日子过的很节省，决没有因为有了钱就胡花起来。规定跑外全由朱眼负责任，另三人担任做饭等杂事。每天规定纺一斤花，夜间一两油点完睡觉。（郑东）
