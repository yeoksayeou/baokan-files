People's Hero Zhang Youjun
	Yuè Yún
　　Comrade Zhang Youjun is the squad leader of the mortar company of the × Regiment of the × Brigade. He has always been brave, firm, and tenacious in combat, and has played a leading role in every battle. In the Shao’erzhai offensive last year, his artillery was firing directly. Due to the short distance (40 meters) and under heavy enemy fire, he relocated his position three times, but continued to fire as usual. Ninety-five percent of his shells hit the enemy's position, completing the glorious task of suppressing the enemy with artillery. Comrade Zhang Youjun became a hero and attended the brigade's hero conference. In the Jinxiang battle in January of this year, his artillery was still 40 meters away from the enemy, and he fired 79 shells, all of which hit the target, collapsing the blockhouse. In the Wanglou battle, only 20 meters across the street, he fired ten shells and broke through a gap, allowing the infantry to charge in. He immediately moved to another position and used six shells to break through another gap. Comrade Youjun was credited for the second time. Under his leadership, heroic enemy-killer Zhang Xinrong and model worker Xu Baode emerged in his squad. Everyone wanted to be a soldier in his squad, and his squad was always able to complete the tasks assigned to them 100%. Coming to the political work team to study, he became an active promoter of learning. He often said, "It is not easy to be able to take time out to study under these frequent combat conditions." Recently, Comrade Youjun received a letter from home, which began with: "Youjun, who has won glory for Heshun County and for our ancestors for three generations: The day before yesterday, we received a letter from the county saying that you have performed meritorious service for the people at the front. County Chief Wang, District Chief Wang, and many cadres held a celebration meeting for five villages, put up a plaque for our family, and even put on a play for a whole day. The government takes special care of our family... You don't need to worry about family matters. We hope you study hard, hone your skills, and make greater contributions and win greater glory for the nation. This is what parents hope for their son..." After reading this letter, Comrade Youjun was so moved that he was about to burst into tears. On the battlefield, he only knew to resolutely complete his tasks and kill more enemies, and did not expect such great honor!

　　人民功臣张友俊
    岳云
    张友俊同志，是×旅×团迫击炮连的班长，一贯作战勇敢、坚定、顽强，每次战斗都起了带头作用。去年邵耳寨攻坚战，他的炮是平射，因距离太近（四十米），在敌强烈火力压迫下一连转移了三次阵地，仍照常发射，百分之九十五的炮弹命中敌人阵地，完成了以炮压倒敌人的光荣任务，张友俊同志成了英雄，出席了纵队群英会。今年一月金乡战斗中，他的炮仍是距离敌四十米，他一直发射了七十九发炮弹，又弹弹命中，把炮楼打塌了。王楼战斗仅隔街二十米，打了十炮，冲破了一个缺口，步兵冲进去了。他立即转到另一阵地，以六发弹又冲破了一个缺口。友俊同志第二次立了功劳。在他的领导下，本班出现了杀敌英雄张新荣，模范工作者徐保德，谁都愿意到他班当战士，他班每次接受的任务，都能百分之百的完成。来政工队学习，他又成了推动学习的积极分子。他常说：“在这战斗频繁的情况下，能抽来学习是很不容易的。”最近友俊同志接到了家信，开头写着：“为和顺县争光、为咱祖宗三代争光的友俊儿：前天接县来信，你在前方为人民已立了功劳，王县长王区长及许多干部召开了五个村的群众祝功大会，给咱挂了匾，还唱了一天戏；政府对咱家的照顾特别周到……家事不用你管，望你好好学习，练好本事，为民族立更大的功劳，争更大的光荣，这才是当父母的对儿的希望………”友俊同志看了这信后，感激的快要流出泪来，战场上他只知道坚决的完成任务，杀死更多的敌人，并未想到会有这大的荣耀！
