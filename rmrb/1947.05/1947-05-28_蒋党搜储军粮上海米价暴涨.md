　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, May 26th: Shanghai newspapers continue to expose the severe food shortage in the Chiang-controlled areas, which is caused by the Chiang government's seizure of military grain. The institutions involved in this plunder include the Storage and Transportation Office under the Chiang-led Ministry of Food (with branches in Shanghai, Nanjing, Anqing, Jiujiang, Hankou, Yichang, etc.), the Provincial Land and Grain Management Offices, and the Chiang-led Bank of China and Farmers Bank, which are entrusted by the Chiang-led Ministry of Food to purchase grain. In early May, when the rice price in Wuxi fluctuated, the Chiang-led China National Grain Corporation seized the opportunity to raise prices and purchase a large amount of grain, buying 8,000 shi of rice in one day, causing panic in the market. Currently, rice from rural areas along the Yangtze River and in Sichuan is being stockpiled by Chiang Kai-shek in the Shanghai Grain General Warehouse as capital for the civil war. The twelve sub-warehouses of the General Warehouse are filled with about 900,000 bags of food grain, enough for the consumption of the Shanghai people for four to five months. However, the Chiang government's food conference claims that from May to September this year, it still needs 1.5 million bags of military rice, about 300 million jin.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, May 26th Urgent Dispatch: According to an Associated Press report from Shanghai on May 25th: The price of rice in Shanghai has risen to 450,000 yuan per shi, up from 420,000 yuan in yesterday's (May 24th) dispatch. During the "Rice Riot" in Nanjing and Shanghai in late April and early May, the highest recorded price was 360,000 yuan.

　　蒋党搜储军粮上海米价暴涨
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】沪报继续揭露蒋管区之严重粮荒，系蒋政府搜购军粮所造成。其搜刮的机构，计有蒋记粮食部下的储运处（上海、南京、安庆、九江、汉口、宜昌等地均有分处），各省的田粮管理处，以及受蒋记粮食部委托收购粮食的蒋记中国银行及农民银行等等。在五月初，无锡米价波动时，蒋记中国粮食公司曾乘机抬价大量收购，一天内即买进大米八千石，因而市场大起恐慌。目前长江两岸农村以及四川食米，均被蒋介石囤积于上海的粮食总仓库内，作为内战资本。总仓库的十二个分库，已装满食粮约计存米九十万包之多，足够上海人民四五个月的消费。而蒋政府粮食会议又称：今年五月至九月，尚需军米一百五十万包，约三万万斤。
    【新华社陕北二十六日急电】据美联社上海二十五日电：上海米价已涨至每石四十五万元，前日（二十四日）电讯尚为四十二万。在四月底五月初的京沪“米骚动”期间，米价最高记录还是三十六万。
