Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, May 25th: Comprehensive report: Following the "May 20th" tragedy in Nanjing and Tianjin, students across the country are increasingly impassioned. In addition to directly lodging serious protests with Chiang Kai-shek and the Political Participation Council, Nanjing students have initiated the organization of a National Student Federation to unify national action. According to Agence France-Presse: branches have been established in Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, Kunming, and other places. On May 22nd, Shanghai students organized the "May 20th Massacre Support Association." Forty colleges and universities are implementing a strike to protest, and secondary schools have also been drawn into the movement, and are now actively preparing to welcome the "June 2nd" Anti-Civil War Day, launching demonstrations and marches involving strikes by students, workers, and merchants. The Shanghai-Woosung Garrison Headquarters is extremely panicked and issued a terroristic "Martial Law" on the same day. On May 22nd, Nankai University in Tianjin established a ten-member delegation to petition in Nanjing. Students at the school began entering factories on May 23rd to conduct propaganda work. Beijing is shrouded in terror, with special agents shooting everywhere. A curfew is enforced throughout the city at night, but students are still going out to conduct propaganda. In Zhejiang, thousands of students from Zhijiang University, Zhejiang University, Ying Shi University, Industrial University, Medical College, City High School, Hangzhou High School, Anding, Zhejiang University Affiliated High School and other universities and middle schools held a demonstration march on May 24th, holding up large colored cartoons and shouting slogans such as "Severely punish the murderers." Students from Yunnan University, Kunhua Normal School, Kunhua Women's Normal School, Kunhua Business School, Kunhua Agricultural School, and other schools in Kunming also went on strike and marched on May 24th. The student unrest in Nanchang has spread to primary and secondary schools. On May 24th, students and faculty members, despite the suppression by Chiang Kai-shek's Jiangxi Provincial Chairman Wang Lingji, participated in marches and petitions.
