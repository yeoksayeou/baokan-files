Ode to the New Muses
(Continued)
Guo Moruo

Like journalists, we must praise cartoonists. Especially during these past two years, the efforts of friends in the cartooning world have been astonishing! Their brains are mental atomic bombs. Leaving aside other places, can a single day or issue of Shanghai's progressive private newspapers and magazines do without cartoons? Cartoons are not just our cigarettes and tea, but our meals! I admire their quick wit, sharpness, depth, richness, and healthiness. I am surprised that publishers haven't collected and published several "Complete Cartoon Collections." They should be able to serve as food for the illiterate masses!

The woodcarver's knife is like lightning during a storm, cleaving the black night sky, so even the accomplices and hangers-on can see the dazzling light. Fortunately, the hard work of woodcarvers has already earned social recognition. The book "Selected Woodcuts of the Eight Years of Resistance" is the crystallization of this hard work. These one hundred works, selected from nearly ten thousand, can truly be considered a rigorous selection. But I dare to believe that such strict selection is only due to publishing difficulties. The publishing direction of the "Selected Works" is aimed at upper-class and foreign readers, and the version strives for excellence, which naturally increases the cost, resulting in such a strict selection. If the target were changed to the masses, like cheap comic books sold on the streets, it shouldn't be too difficult to print all ten thousand, right? It's a pity that didn't happen, to chill the accomplices' spirits!

The efforts of drama and film workers are also obvious, but their hardships are unimaginable even in the dreams of greenhouse writers. Many who served on the front lines have made sacred sacrifices, and many more have suffered imprisonment. Some were disbanded after the victory and are now wandering the streets. Others, though still tethered, are not warm enough in their clothing or full enough in their stomachs. Those working in the cities, under the crushing burden of heavy taxes and invisible censorship, are dragging heavy usury and fighting a precarious, blood-soaked battle. Some are making irresponsible remarks, saying "not worth a look." That's true. How could pampered flowers in greenhouses know the cruelty of snowy, icy weather? However, the pines and cypresses remain lush; they do not crave your "look."

The voices of musicians have been particularly subdued lately. Unfortunate musicians, their fate seems particularly tragic. Before the War of Resistance, Nie Er died at sea; after the War of Resistance, Huang Zi died of illness; Zhang Shu died in an enemy air raid, Ren Guang died during the Jiangnan encirclement; Xian Xinghai died in exile. But are they really dead? Has the sound of music disappeared? No! It is they and many other friends who are still persevering through hardships who have stirred up the torrent of resistance songs in this silent desert. The sound wave remains in the hearts of millions, who can destroy it! The "Yellow River Cantata" and the "Democracy Cantata" are silently roaring in everyone's hearts. Once they erupt, they will fill the entire Chinese sky. Those who sell out the motherland and their souls are deeply afraid of hearing the call of the national soul, but can you suppress it?

I devoutly salute these friends, these literary friends outside the greenhouse who write novels, poems, plays, and criticisms, friends engaged in ancient and modern historical research, friends in the news industry, friends in the cartoon and woodcut world, friends in the new music world, friends in the drama and film world. Friends, I want to praise you as "The Nine New Muses of the New Era." You are truly overcoming the current super hell with superhuman effort and sowing the seeds for us. To say that you have nothing to show is the slander of accomplices! But your suffering from such slander is precisely your glory. Now is the time when all values are reversed: deer are horses, horses are deer, black is white, white is black, existence is non-existence, non-existence is existence. You have nothing to show the "people" of kings and ministers, but you have floods of things to show the "people" of the masses. I praise you, I thank you. It is you who have given me warmth, courage, and encouragement, so that I can still persevere and not become a lifeless zombie. It is you who have given me a lofty model, so that I want to rouse my spirit and serve the masses of the people, serve until the day I can no longer serve.

I must admit that I have maintained a principle in my life: to remain silent when necessary, to "not do" when necessary. I am not trying to "protect myself wisely," but rather believe that silence is also a weapon. I believe that "by not doing something, one can do something else." I was born in Sichuan and am a person who uses a pen. Ancient writers from Sichuan have presented me with a lesson from the past, making me hold a warning in my heart: "Do not be Yang Xiong" (Note 3)! To this day, perhaps I can report innocently to our Nine Muses, to our masses of the people. Although I have not produced any works worth offering, I am fortunate that I have not made myself into a "Yang Xiong." This possible danger, in the twenty-odd years since I have been engaged in writing activities, has not lacked opportunities to approach me, but I have carefully avoided it. Today, I seem to be able to believe that I have immunity.

But today, I deeply feel that such a life principle is too passive, too selfish, too petty-bourgeois. I cannot just "not do," but should "do." For example, even if it is to be a Yang Xiong who sings praises, what is wrong with me being a Yang Xiong for the masses of the people? I should sing the praises of the achievements of the masses of the people, praise the virtues of the masses of the people. The masses of the people are our supreme Zeus, and our ability to maintain a thread of survival until today is truly his grace. Our Nine New Muses, you are also under his protection, whether you already know it or not. Your activities have dedicated themselves to him, and in the future, you will dedicate yourselves to him even more wholeheartedly. I want to follow you, be your tail, work hard to learn from you, and work even harder to learn from our Zeus. Cartooning, woodcuts, and music are beyond my ability, and directing and performing dramas and films are also not my forte, but I can write poetry, novels, plays, and criticism. Or I may dedicate my strength specifically to historical studies. If there is a chance to fly, I will still fly, especially "fly to Moscow." I am not afraid of professors (Note 4) shaking their heads at me, I am only afraid of myself shaking my head at myself, afraid of my Nine Muses shaking their heads at me, afraid of the people shaking their heads at me. It would be most pleasant if I pretended to work hard enough to make the professors shake their heads off.

I will still struggle in this icy world, I will take root, I will sprout, I will blossom and bear fruit. This is my reality. I may also have to run errands for red and white affairs, as long as the red and white affairs are related to the masses of the people, they are also my reality. I hear a voice coming from the greenhouse: "Learn from reality." This is a very pleasant voice, although the "reality" in the greenhouse is not my reality, and the "learning" in the greenhouse is not my learning, but I still like that pleasant voice. Who can deny it? The flowers and plants in the greenhouse are pitiful after all, aren't they? They also have their "posts," let them appreciate them alone, or be appreciated by the objects they yearn for. Learning to prostrate oneself from the frankness under the pomegranate skirt, learning to masturbate from the frankness in the quilt, that is the freedom of those who are different from the vulgar. At least in this respect, I am also a liberal; I am unwilling to violate the freedom of others. However, I dare to be confident that although I have no achievements before, the main reason is probably due to my "not doing," and from now on I will "do." The cold winter will not be too long. With our new Zeus above, and our Nine New Muses beside us, who can determine that I will not receive their blessing, so that I also get a continuous new "inspiration"?

I will mercilessly liquidate everything before 1946 and bravely welcome today and tomorrow in 1947. (Written on January 5th. Reprinted from "Wen Cui" magazine)

[Note 3] Yang Xiong, courtesy name Ziyun, was a native of Chengdu in the Han Dynasty. He wrote very well in Ci and Fu styles and authored works such as Tai Xuan, Fa Yan, Fang Yan, etc. When Wang Mang ascended the throne, because of concerns about literary inquisition, he jumped down from the "Tianlu Pavilion" and almost died. He was forced to become an official of the Xin Dynasty and began to sing praises.
[Note 4] Last October, a reporter from Yi Shi Bao interviewed Shen Congwen. When Guo Moruo was mentioned, "he shook his head," and said, "... Mao Dun is also very quiet, not like Guo Moruo who flies to Moscow." He also expressed other fallacies that literature must be separated from politics. The "liberal professor" mentioned in the article probably refers to him, but the main point is to expose the Jiang family's abuse of culture and praise the hard struggle of progressive cultural workers.
(Correction: Yu Ru, a female novelist from the Southwest, said in the previous note that she wrote about national industry, which was a misremembering.)

　　新缪斯九神礼赞
   （续完）
    郭沫若
    和新闻记者一样，我们要礼赞漫画家。特别在这两年的期间，漫画界朋友们的努力是怎样惊人啊！他们的脑筋是精神上的原子弹。别的地方暂且不说，上海的几份进步的民间报纸和杂志，有那一天那一期能够离得开漫画？漫画不仅等于我们的烟，我们的茶，而且等于我们的饭了！我佩服那机智的锐敏，深刻，丰富而健康。我惊讶于出版家们为什么没人收集起来出它几部“漫画大全”，那应该是可以使不识字的大众读者们把它当成食粮的！
    木刻家的刀，暴风大雷雨时的闪电，划破了黑夜的太空，就是帮凶和帮闲，也得看见了那炫目的光芒。木刻家们的辛苦，可庆幸的是已经赢到社会的重视了。“抗战八年木刻选集”一书是这辛苦的结晶。这从将近一万份的作品中选出的一百幅，真可以算得极严格的选择。但我敢于相信，这样的严选仅是由于出版上的困难。“选集”出版的方针是以上层和外国的阅者为对象，版本务求精良，因而成本也就自然增高，这便产生了那样严格的甄选。假使把对象掉换成人民群众，像街头出卖的连环画那样，廉价印行，就把一万张全部印出来，应该也不会怎么困难的吧。可惜没那样，使帮凶们也寒一寒胆！
    戏剧电影工作者的努力也是有目共睹的，而他们的辛酸在温室作家们当然是连做梦也想不到，在战地服务的工作者不少已经在前线上作了神圣的牺牲，更有不少的人受过缧马的痛苦，有的在胜利后被解散了，至今多流落街头，有的虽然被靼縻着，而衣不能暖，食不能饱。在城市服务的工作者，在杀人的苛重捐税与无形的检查制度下，拖着沉重的高利贷，作朝不保夕的滴血的奋斗。有人在作漫无责任的放言，说“不值一顾”，倒是事实，在温室中娇养惯了的名花那里会知道雪地冰天的惨酷。然而松柏依然是森森的，他们并不希罕你名花们的“一顾”。
    音乐家的声音，近来是特别的消沉了。不幸的音乐家们，他们的际遇似乎特别悲惨。抗战直前，聂耳死于海；抗战以后，黄自死于病；张曙死于敌机轰炸，任光死于江南围剿；冼星海死于流亡。但他们真是死了吗？音乐的声音沉没了吗？不！是他们和其他许多还在苦难中坚毅撑持的朋友，使中国在这个无声的沙漠，卷起了抗战歌曲的洪流。那声浪留存在千千万万人的心中，谁能够消灭了它！“黄河大合唱”，“民主大合唱”，在人人的心中作着无声的怒吼，一旦爆发了出来，会是塞满全中国的太空。出卖祖国出卖灵魂的人们，就深怕听这民族灵魂的呼号，然而你能禁制得了吗？
    我虔诚地敬礼着这些朋友，这些温室之外的小说、诗歌、剧作、批评的文学上的朋友，从事于古代和近代的史学研究的朋友，新闻界的朋友，漫画木刻界的朋友，新音乐界的朋友，戏剧电影界的朋友。朋友们哟，我想称颂你们为“新时代的缪司九神”，你们真以超人的努力，克服着当前的超级地狱，而在替我们播着火种，说你们没有货色拿出来见人者，那是帮凶者的诬蔑！但你们受着这样诬蔑，也正是你们的光荣。目前是一切价值倒逆的时候，鹿是马、马是鹿，黑是白、白是黑，有是无、无是有。你们没有货色可以见王公大夫的“人”，而你们尽有洪水一般的货色可以见人民大众的“人”。我礼赞你们，感激你们，是你们给与了我以温暖，以勇气，以鼓励，使我还能坚持着，不至成为丧失了生命力的僵尸。是你们给予了我以崇高的模范，使我想抖擞起我的精神，为人民大众服务，服务到我不能再服务的一天。
    我要承认，我生前曾经保持着一个生活的原则，便是遇必要时保持沉默，遇必要时“有所不为”。我也并不是想“明哲保身”，而是认为沉默也是一种武器，我是相信着“有所不为而又可以有为”的。我是生于四川，而且是拿着笔杆活动的人，四川出产的古代文人向我提示了一个殷鉴，使我自己怀着一个戒心：便是“不要做扬雄”（注三）！到今天为止，或许我也可以向我们的缪司九神，向我们的人民大众差告无罪，我虽然没有什么值得奉献的作品产出，然而我幸得还没有把我自己造成为一个“扬雄”。这个可能的危险，在我从事文笔活动以来的二十几年的当中，并不是没有接近我的机会，然而我兢兢业业地把它避开了。我今天似乎可以相信得过我已经是有了免疫性的。
    但到了今天，我却深切地感觉着，那样的生活原则是太消极，太自私、太小资产阶级的了。我不能光是“不要做”，而是应该“要做”。譬如就是做歌功颂德的杨雄吧，我假如做人民大众的扬雄，又有什么不可？我是应该歌人民大众的功，颂人民大众的德的。人民大众才是我们至高无上的宙司大神，我们之得以维持着一线的生存而直到今天，实在是他的恩惠。我们的新缪司九神，你们也是受了他的庇荫的，无论你们是已经知道或许还不曾知道。你们的活动曾经奉献了他来，今后也会更专心诚意的向他奉献。我要跟着你们，做你们的尾巴，努力向你们学习，更努力向我们的宙司大神学习。漫画、木刻、音乐是我所不能做的，戏剧电影的导演和演出也非我所能，但我能写诗歌、小说、剧本、批评。或者我可能把我的力量专门贡献于史学。假如有机会飞，我还是要飞的，尤其“飞莫斯科”。我并不怕教授（注四）们向我摇头，我只怕的我自己向我摇头，怕我的中缪司九神们向我摇头，怕人民向我摇头，我假装的努力到使教授们把头摇断，那是最愉快的事。
    我依然会在这冰天雪地中挣扎，我要扎根，我要迸芽，我要开花结果。这儿是我的现实。我可能也还要为红白喜事奔走，只要和人民大众有关的红白喜事也就是我的现实。我听见有声音自温室中来：“从现实学习”吧。这是很中听的声音，虽然温室中的“现实”不是我的现实，而温室中的“学习”不是我的学习，但我还是喜欢那个中听的声音。谁个又能够否认？那温室中的花草们毕竟是可怜的呢？他们也有他们的“岗位”，让他们去独自欣赏，或为所憧憬的对象们所欣赏吧。从石榴裙下的坦实去学习拜倒，从被窝中的坦实去学习自渎，那是不同乎流俗者的自由。至少在这一方面我也是一位自由主义者，我是不愿意干犯别人的自由的。然而我敢于自信，我以前虽然毫无成就，主要的原因大约也就是由于我的“有所不为”，而我今后却是要“有所为”了。严寒的冬季也不会那么太久的。有我们的新宙司大神在上，有我们的新缪司九神在旁，谁能量定我就得不到他们的加被，使我也得到不断的新的“灵感”？
    我要毫不容情地清算我一九四六年前的一切，而勇敢地迎接着一九四七年的今天和明天。（一月五日写。转载自《文萃》杂志）
    【注三】扬雄，字子云，汉代成都人，词赋写得很好，著有太玄、法言、方言等等。当王莽即位后，因为文字狱的牵挂，从“天禄阁”上跳下来，差一点没摔死，便被迫做了新朝的官，歌功颂德起来。
    【注四】去年十月，益世报记者曾访问沈从文，当提及郭沫若时，“他表示摇首”，并说：“……茅盾也很沉静，不像郭沫若一般的飞莫斯科。”又发表了其他一些文学必须与政治隔离的谬论，文中所提“自由主义教授”，盖即指他来说，但主旨还是揭露蒋家对文化的虐害，歌颂进步文化工作者的苦斗。
    （更正：郁如，西南女小说家，前期注中说写民族工业，系误记。）
