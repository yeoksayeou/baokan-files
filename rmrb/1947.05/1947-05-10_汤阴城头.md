　　Tangyin City Wall
    Fang De
    One day at dusk, outside the West Gate, the People's Liberation Army continuously fired various caliber cannons, machine gunners and infantry sealed off the gun emplacements, and the enemy machine guns trapped in the city gate fortress stopped, and the sound of the rifles also seemed surprisingly sparse. The charge in the trenches launched, heavy artillery concentrated its fire on the city tower, which was riddled with holes, the city gate was breached, bricks and tiles whistled everywhere, and the dust and smoke made the sky very dim, making the splashing sparks particularly dazzling. The soldiers squatting in the trenches raised their hand grenades with the fuses pulled, some clutching their guns, ready to rush to the top of the city. As soon as the artillery fire stopped, the brave men pounced in. The Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops fleeing along the city wall ran ahead, with the brave men chasing closely behind. The embarrassed Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops ran off their shoes, and threw away bullets and grenades. As the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops ran, they were surrounded, and they shouted "Stop fighting, hand over your guns, surrender!" Here, the People's Liberation Army captured one thousand one hundred prisoners at the cost of no more than ten people.

　　汤阴城头

    一日黄昏，西关外围解放军各种口径的炮连续发射，机枪射手和步兵把枪眼都封锁起来，困守城关堡垒中的敌人机枪停了，步枪的声音也显得惊人地稀疏。伏在战壕里的冲锋发动了，重炮向城楼集中射击，城楼打得稀烂，城门被打穿，砖瓦到处呼啸，尘土硝烟使天空变得非常昏暗，飞溅的火花特别显得耀眼。蹲在战壕里的战士们，举起拉出引线的手榴弹，有的紧握着枪，准备冲上城头。炮声一停，勇士们便猛扑进去。沿着城墙逃跑的蒋伪军在前面跑，勇士们紧追在后面，狼狈的蒋伪军跑掉了鞋子，扔掉了子弹手榴弹。蒋伪军跑着跑着被包围了，他们高呼“不打了交枪、投降”在这儿的解放军以不过十个人的代价，捉住了一千一百个俘虏。
