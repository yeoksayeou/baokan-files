Our Army in Northern Henan Creates New Method
    Concentrated Use of Stretchers Saves Significant Civilian Labor
    [Report from the Northern Henan Front, May 17th] The troops under General Liu Bocheng have created a new method of concentrated stretcher use, greatly saving civilian labor and facilitating the escort of the wounded. In the early stages of the Self-Defense War, civilian stretcher-bearers were mostly used in an average and dispersed manner. The disadvantages were: First, due to different combat tasks, there were not enough stretchers where casualties were heavy, and too many where casualties were light. Second, it was very difficult for civilian stretcher-bearers to be accommodated, managed, and educated in the regimental headquarters, and many were uneasy about carrying the wounded to the front lines. Third, the number of stretchers allocated on average was bound to be large, resulting in significant consumption of civilian labor, food, firewood, and grass. Since the Shao'erzhai battle in November of last year, army stretchers have been established, with the number held by the column twice that held by the brigade, and the brigade having one more than the regiment. Before the battle, the stretchers of the column were distributed with emphasis to the brigades with tasks, and can also be called upon when necessary. If organized well, each stretcher can carry five or six times per night. Civilian stretcher-bearers do not go to the front lines. They are directly controlled by the column, with roughly two-fifths placed at the column headquarters and three-fifths placed at the column aid station. In advance, two cadres are sent by the brigade to wait at the column headquarters to lead the stretcher-bearers, and then they are assigned to the brigade according to the casualties at the front. In the beginning, everyone agreed in principle, but when specific tasks came, they were all afraid of not having enough and tried to get more by various means. This relied entirely on the column promptly grasping the situation and resolutely concentrating the use with emphasis. Therefore, the rescue work in the recent battles has been very timely, and management and education are convenient, saving a lot of civilian labor and supplies. (Yu Hua)

　　豫北我军创造新办法
    担架集中使用节省大量民力
    【本报豫北前线十七日电】刘伯承将军所部创造部队担架集中使用的新办法，大大节省了民力，并便利了彩号的护送。自卫战争初期民夫担架多平均分散使用，其缺点为：第一、战斗任务不同，伤亡重的不够用，伤亡少的用不了。第二、民夫担架在团部住宿管理教育都很困难，上火线抬彩号也多不安。第三、平均分配数目必多，因此民力粮食柴草的消费甚大。自去年十一月邵耳寨战役后，乃建立部队担架，纵队所有者为旅所有者之二倍，旅比团又多一倍。战斗前将纵队的担架有重点的分散给有任务的旅，必要时并可调用。如组织的好，每付每晚可抬五六次。民夫担架不上火线，由纵队直接掌握，大体上以五分之二放在纵队指挥所，以五分之三放在纵队救护所，事先由旅派干部两人在纵队指挥所等候带领，然后根据前方战斗伤亡情况，随时分配给旅使用。开始时大家在原则上同意，但到具体任务一来都怕靠不住，找各种办法想多要一点，这就全靠纵队及时掌握情况，坚决有重点的集中使用。因此最近几次战役中救护都很及时，且管教方便，节省的民力粮草甚多。（于华）
