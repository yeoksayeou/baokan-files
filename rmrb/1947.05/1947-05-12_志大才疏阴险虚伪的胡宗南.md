　　Chiang Kai-shek's last card, Hu Zongnan, is now stuck in northern Shaanxi; he can't advance, and he can't retreat. Hu Zongnan is now riding the tiger. Chiang Kai-shek has cultivated Hu Zongnan as his loyal lackey and vicious claw for more than 20 years, hoping to use him to save the day in the most difficult times; Chiang Kai-shek, having exhausted all other options, decided to attack Yan'an, and only then did he use all of Hu Zongnan's forces. Chiang Kai-shek was genuinely pleased when he occupied Yan'an. The Third Plenary Session of the Kuomintang in March even sent a "commendation telegram," praising Hu Zongnan to the skies. However, in less than two months, the facts have proved that Hu Zongnan, on whom Chiang Kai-shek relies, is truly an "ambitious but incompetent" good-for-nothing.

　　Since Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the Great Revolution, Hu Zongnan has always been Chiang Kai-shek's tool for civil war. By fighting the civil war, Hu Zongnan became Chiang Kai-shek's "favorite student." Chiang Kai-shek's trust in him even exceeded that of Chen Cheng. However, Hu Zongnan always lost battles in the civil war (and the "War of Resistance"), and he was a famous "ever-defeated general." From 1932 to 1933, Hu Zongnan first took part in the battles against the Red Army in Hubei, Henan, and Anhui, and was immediately defeated by the People's Army under the command of Generals Xu Xiangqian, Cai Shengxi, and Chen Geng. In 1935, when fighting in the Sichuan-Shaanxi-Gansu border area, he was once trapped in the Songpan area of northwestern Sichuan by the Red Army's First and Fourth Front Armies, and almost the entire army was wiped out. In 1936, in the battle of Shanchengpu on the Shaanxi-Gansu border, Hu's army was again wiped out a regiment by the Red Army. This was the last battle of the ten-year civil war. Hu Zongnan followed the Red Army for thousands of miles, always acting as a transport team for the Red Army in the capacity of a defeated general.

　　After the War of Resistance, Hu Zongnan's First Army was foolishly lost in Shanghai. Later, when the Japanese army attacked Nanjing, Hu Zongnan fled to Pukou. In 1938, when defending the Xinyang area of the southern section of the Pinghan Railway, he was defeated in successive battles. Since then, he has hid in Tongguan, away from the anti-Japanese battlefield, and lingered outside the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border area. Until the end of the War of Resistance (1944), Tang Enbo suffered a disastrous defeat in Henan, and the so-called "second-line" Hu Zongnan army in Luoyang and other places collapsed at the first touch, fleeing in panic.

　　From the Battle of Wuhan in 1938 to the present, for ten years, Hu Zongnan has been hiding in the Northwest, specializing in oppressing the people and creating civil war. He launched five anti-communist wars: the first in the summer of 1939, when he attacked our Guanzhong Liberated Area and successively occupied the five county towns of Chunhua, Gouyi, Zhenning, Ningxian, and Zhenyuan, truly becoming the first person to provoke civil war during the War of Resistance. The second was in July 1943, when he attacked Lucheng County, but was immediately frustrated and retreated. The third was in 1944, when he attacked Guanzhong again, but was defeated at Yetaishan. The fourth was in 1946, when he invaded Guanzhong, but was also repelled. The all-out invasion of the border area in March this year is the fifth. This time, the scale was larger than previous times, mobilizing 20 brigades of his direct troops, and also coordinating 11 brigades of non-direct troops from Ningxia, Qinghai, Gansu, and Yulin, totaling 31 brigades. Hu Zongnan, overestimating his own capabilities, attempted to capture the CCP's leadership and the main force of the Northwest People's Liberation Army, and even shamelessly told the press corps about "building" Yan'an. Now that he is sitting in Yan'an, Hu Zongnan probably has tasted some of the flavors of this military adventure. In northern Shaanxi alone, Hu Zongnan has sacrificed four brigade commanders in more than two months, one killed and three captured, and three brigades have been wiped out (three brigade headquarters, four complete regiments, one security regiment, and two complete battalions. Other scattered eliminations of more than 5,000 enemy soldiers are not counted), an average of one brigade being wiped out every 20 days. As for southern Shanxi, Hu Zongnan's more than one year of management has been largely ruined. His old nest, Guanzhong, is extremely empty and huge changes can happen at any time.

　　Hu Zongnan is determined to make his fortune in the Northwest. After the Xi'an Incident, Hu Zongnan took the opportunity to seize control of Xi'an and has refused to let go ever since. Although he was once transferred to the eastern battlefield in the early days of the War of Resistance, after three consecutive disastrous defeats, he quickly sneaked into Tongguan and refused to come out again.

　　In Hu Zongnan's mind, the five provinces of the Northwest (Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang) are all territories he wants to dominate, and Shanxi is also within his scope. Therefore, in the past, Chiang Kai-shek's senior officials in the Northwest, such as Zhu Shaoliang and Jiang Dingwen, could not control Hu Zongnan. Chiang Kai-shek sent these people to protect Hu Zongnan's growth.

　　Hu Zongnan wants to be the King of the Northwest, and the first thing he wants to eliminate is not the Communist Party, because he has already deeply tasted the "long-term torture" of "suppressing the Communists." What he wants to eliminate first is Yang Hucheng and Gao Guizi in Shaanxi, Deng Baoshan and Lu Dachang in Gansu, Ma Bufang and Ma Buqing in Qinghai and the Hexi Corridor of Gansu, Sheng Shicai in Xinjiang, and Ma Hongkui in Ningxia. None of these people have not suffered at his hands. General Yang Hucheng's old troops have been broken to pieces, Sheng Shicai and Lu Dachang have completely collapsed, Deng Baoshan is guarding Yulin in vain, which is equivalent to being exiled to the desert; Gao Guizi's troops have been reorganized, and Ma Buqing's troops have been exiled to Xinjiang and will never be allowed to return; Ma Bufang has been forced to shrink back to Qinghai. Only Ma Hongkui and Zuo Xiezong occupy a slightly advantageous position and still maintain a precarious situation; however, Hu Zongnan has divided and bought over their capable subordinates, and Ma Hongkui and Zuo Xiezong are not so free and easy anymore.

　　Hu Zongnan's plot to control Xinjiang has been going on for a long time. His intention in cultivating the Hui Muslim Yang Deliang is for this purpose. When Sheng Shicai openly betrayed the people of Xinjiang and surrendered to Chiang Kai-shek, Hu Zongnan took the opportunity to send Li Tiejun and Yang Deliang's troops into Xinjiang one after another, forcing Sheng Shicai away. Hu Zongnan was complacent, but he didn't know that he had forced the national self-defense war in northwestern Xinjiang. Li and Yang's armies were defeated in successive battles, and almost the entire army was wiped out. Thus, Hu Zongnan's left hand was cut off outside Yumenguan.

　　Hu Zongnan regards himself as "Chiang Kai-shek the Second." The Northwest is not his final goal, but only his starting point. Therefore, after Japan surrendered, his ambition turned to North China. He extended his basic troops, the 16th Army, into Beiping, controlled the Shijiazhuang, the intersection of Pinghan and Zhengtai Railways with the 3rd Army, and controlled southern Shanxi with his most capable 1st Army and 90th Army (both now reorganized as divisions). After the 1st and 90th Armies were transferred back to attack the border area, he still left the 30th Division and the 38th Division there, creating a situation where they could control Tianjin and Peiping when advancing, and seize Yan Xishan's Taiyuan when retreating. Hu Zongnan's ambition even extended to the Northeast for a period of time. He originally wanted to be the king of the three Norths: Northwest, North China, and Northeast. Chiang Kai-shek's transfer of Du Yuming to the Northeast made Hu Zongnan extremely sad; but what made him even sadder was that he couldn't even be the king of North China. Now the Pinghan, Zhengtai, and Tongpu Railways are controlled by the People's Liberation Army, and his right hand has been cut off east of the Yellow River.

　　Hu Zongnan rose to prominence by expanding and annexing, and the internal factions are complex. Chiang Kai-shek's treachery and cunning were also inherited by Hu Zongnan without exception. Although Hu Zongnan is a graduate of the Huangpu Military Academy, he is most afraid of the Shaanxi Huangpu forming its own faction. In this regard, he not only has contradictions with Du Yuming and Guan Linzheng (both from Shaanxi), but also is extremely uneasy about Dong Zhao. He transferred Dong Zhao's 16th Army to North China, but wanted Dong Zhao to lead his own direct 1st Division and 90th Division. As for the miscellaneous troops, they were all divided and disintegrated by Hu Zongnan. The former 17th Route Army was once divided by him; later, General Kong Congzhou led an anti-civil war uprising. One of Gao Guizi's armies was first reorganized into a division, then reorganized into a brigade (84th Brigade); he was still uneasy about this brigade, so he transferred one of its regiments to Yuncheng, Shanxi, and the other regiment was transferred to northern Shaanxi. One of the armies under Liu Maoen was also reduced to a division (15th Division), then reduced to a brigade (64th Brigade), and then Hu's 135th Brigade (which has now been wiped out) was incorporated into the division for supervision. Deng Baoshan's troops in Yulin were even more messed up after being transferred. Recently, Hu Zongnan was deeply afraid that Deng's troops would be "ineffective in combat," so he airlifted two regiments to Yulin and drove Deng's troops out of the city of Yulin.

　　Due to Hu Zongnan's exorbitant taxes and levies on the people of the Northwest, peasant uprisings have sprung up in various parts of Shaanxi and Gansu in the past few years. This peasant uprising has even developed to the Longhai Railway line, where Hu Zongnan's rule is strongest. Once Hu Zongnan fails, this latent hatred will immediately erupt. At that time, not only will the Hu army trapped in the border area find it difficult to escape the net of annihilation, but also its rear base will be burned by the flames of this erupting hatred.

　　Hu Zongnan's dream of being the "King of the Northwest" will inevitably be shattered in the Northwest. It is destined that this ambitious, incompetent, treacherous, and hypocritical ever-defeated general will have his life's evils settled in this military adventure. And this is also a symbol of the dying of Chiang Kai-shek's fascist rule.

　　志大才疏阴险虚伪的胡宗南
    新华社记者
    蒋介石的最后一张牌——胡宗南，现在在陕北卡着了；进又进不得，退又退不得，胡宗南现在是骑上了老虎背。蒋介石培养胡宗南作他的忠实走狗、恶毒爪牙已经廿多年了，满心希望在最困难时用他来救驾；蒋介石在走头无路之后决定打延安，才使用了胡宗南的全部兵力。在占领延安时，蒋介石着实高兴了一番。三月召开的国民党三中全会，还拍了一个“嘉奖电”，把胡宗南捧得上天。然而不到两个月，事实证明蒋介石所依靠的胡宗南，实在是一个“志大才疏”的饭桶。
    从蒋介石背叛大革命开始，胡宗南一直是蒋介石的内战工具。靠了打内战，胡宗南成了蒋介石的“得意门生”。蒋介石对他的信任甚至超过陈诚。但是胡宗南在内战（以及“抗战”）中却总是打败仗，是有名的“常败将军”。一九三二年至三三年，胡宗南在鄂豫皖首先出马与红军作战，立即被徐向前、蔡升熙、陈赓等将军所部的人民军队击败。一九三五年在川陕甘边作战时，又曾被红军一、四方面军困于川西北的松潘地区，几乎全军覆没。一九三六年陕甘边山城堡之役，胡军又被红军消灭了一个旅。这是十年内战中的最后一仗，胡宗南随红军转战数千里，一直以红军手下一员败将的资格充当红军的运输队。
    抗战后，胡宗南的第一军在上海愚笨地损失殆尽。以后日军进攻南京，胡宗南逃到浦口。一九三八年防守平汉南段之信阳一带，又是连战连败。从此躲入潼关，远离抗日战场，徘徊陕甘宁边区门外。直至抗战末期（一九四四年）汤恩伯在河南惨败，洛阳等地所谓“第二线”的胡宗南军，又是一触即溃，望风而逃。
    从一九三八年武汉会战后，到现在十个年头，胡宗南一直躲在西北，专门压迫人民制造内战。他曾经发动了五次反共战争：第一次于一九三九年夏，向我关中解放区进攻，先后侵占了淳化、枸邑、正宁、宁县、镇原五个县城，诚为抗战中挑起内战的第一人。第二次于一九四三年七月向鹿县进攻，立即受挫败退。一九四四年第三次向关中进攻，又败于爷台山。一九四六年第四次进犯关中，但亦被击退。今年三月的倾巢进入边区，是第五次了。这次规模较历次为大，动员其嫡系部队二十个旅，还配合宁夏、青海、甘肃、榆林等非嫡系的十一个旅，共达三十一个旅之众。胡宗南不自量力的企图捕捉中共首脑部与西北人民解放军主力，还大言不惭对记者团说什么“建设”延安。现在坐在延安的胡宗南，对于这一次军事冒险滋味大概会尝到一些了。单在陕北，胡宗南两个多月内牺牲了四个旅长，一死三俘，被消灭了三个旅（三个旅部，四个整团，一个保安团，另个整营。其他零碎消灭敌五千人以上不计），平均约二十天被歼一个旅。至于晋南，胡宗南一年多经营已经大部完蛋了。其老巢关中则空虚万分，随时可以发生巨大变化。
    胡宗南是决心拿西北起家的。西安事变后胡宗南即乘机把持西安，从此不肯放手。抗战初期虽曾一度调至东战场，但接连三次惨败后，他又赶快钻进潼关，再也不肯出去了。
    在胡宗南的心目中，西北五省（陕、甘、宁、青、新）都是他要霸占的地盘，山西也在其范围之中。故过去蒋介石在西北的大员如朱绍良、蒋鼎文之流，对于胡宗南都是支配不动的。蒋介石派这些人的目的，也是为了掩护胡宗南的成长。
    胡宗南要作西北王，他首先要消灭的并不是共产党，因他已经深深尝过“剿共”这“长期苦刑”的味道。他首先要消灭的还是陕西的杨虎城、高桂滋，甘肃的邓宝珊、鲁大昌，青海及甘肃西北走廊的马步芳、马步青，新疆的盛世才，宁夏的马鸿逵。这些人没有不吃过他的苦头的。杨虎城将军旧部已弄得支离破碎，盛世才、鲁大昌已根本垮台，邓宝珊空守榆林，等于充军沙漠；高桂滋的部队已被改编，马步青的部队已被充军新疆，永远不得回来；马步芳被逼缩回青海。只有马鸿逵、左协忠占点地位便宜，还保持苟延残喘的局面；不过胡宗南已把他们的得力部下分化收买，马鸿逵、左协忠也不是那样自由自在了。
    胡宗南之图新疆？为时已久。他培养回教徒杨德亮的用意在此。当盛世才公开背叛新疆人民向蒋介石投降时，胡宗南乘机派了李铁军、杨德亮两军先后开入新疆，逼走了盛世才。胡宗南正洋洋自得，那知已逼成新疆西北一带的民族自卫战争。李、杨两军连战皆北，几乎全军覆没。于是胡宗南的左手便断在玉门关外。
    胡宗南心目中自命是“蒋介石第二”，西北还不是他最后的目的，只是他的起点。因此日本投降后，他的野心转向华北。他把基本部队第十六军伸入北平，第三军控制平汉与正太交叉点之石家庄，而以其最精干之第一军及第九十军（现均改师）控制晋南。一军、九十军调回进攻边区后，还将三十师三十八师留在那里。成为进可以制平津，退可以夺阎锡山之太原的形势。胡宗南的野心甚至在一个时期扩展到东北。他原想作西北、华北、东北三北之王。蒋介石把杜聿明调去东北，曾使胡宗南极为伤心；但更伤心的是他连华北王也做不到。现在平汉、正太、同蒲都被解放军控制，他的右手又切断在黄河以东了。
    胡宗南靠扩充吞并起家，内部派系复杂，而蒋介石的阴险权诈也毫不例外的为胡宗南所承袭。胡宗南虽然是黄埔正牌，但他却最怕陕西黄埔自成一系。在这方面他不仅与杜聿明、关麟征（均陕西人）有矛盾，而且对董钊也极不放心。他把董钊的第十六军调到华北去，却把自己的嫡系第一师及九十师要董钊去带领。至于杂牌则全遭胡宗南分化解体。过去的十七路军即曾被其分化；后来由孔从周将军率领举行了反内战起义。高桂滋的一个军初被改编为师，再改编为旅（八十四旅）；对于这个旅还不放心，又将其中一个团调到山西运城，另一个团则被调到陕北。刘茂恩部下的一个军也被其缩编为师（十五师），再缩为旅（六十四旅）而另以胡之一三五旅（现已被歼）编入该师，实行监视。榆林之邓宝珊部队更被调得稀烂。最近胡宗南深怕邓部“作战不力”，又空运两个团到榆林，并且把邓部由榆林城内赶出城外。
    由于胡宗南对于西北人民的横征暴敛，过去几年中陕甘各地民变蜂起，这一民变曾一直发展到胡宗南统治最强的陇海线上。这种潜伏的仇恨，一旦当胡宗南失败就会立即喷发出来。那时不仅陷身边区的胡军难得逃脱歼灭之网，其后方的老巢亦必为此种喷发的仇恨怒火所烧尽。
    胡宗南“西北王”的幻梦必将破灭在西北，命运注定，这位野心十足、志大才疏、阴险虚伪的常败将军，其一生恶迹必在这次的军事冒险中得到清算。而这也正是蒋介石法西斯统治将要死灭的象征。
