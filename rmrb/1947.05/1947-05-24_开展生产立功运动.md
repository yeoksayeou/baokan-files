Our newspaper's editorial, "Launch a Crash Planting and Great Production Movement," called for launching a competition among all cadres on the production front to earn merit for the people and to ensure victory in production. The cadres of Jincheng County, districts, and villages have widely launched a production and war participation campaign to earn merit. This is an important step in promoting production movements and strengthening production leadership, and it is also a strong guarantee for winning victories on the production front. The experiences of the first district of Huguan and other places have also proven that grasping commendations and role models in crash planting, encouraging cadres to build on their merits, and organizing forces to carry out production with all their strength can smoothly overcome difficulties and complete plans. Moreover, it proves that if this method is implemented throughout the entire production process, creating a conscious action for cadres and the masses, the great production movement will be launched quickly.

The demand of the broad masses of liberated peasants in our region is to organize, develop production, build a prosperous home, and become wealthy. However, the key to truly organizing the masses' enthusiasm for production into action still depends on the leadership's attention. Cadres at all levels must personally get involved and go deep among the masses; pay attention to helping solve the difficulties of the masses in production, improve the masses' production awareness, and help the masses organize labor, creating a warm mass movement. Disregarding mass production and letting things take their own course will make it impossible to organize the masses. The launch of merit-earning competitions and the implementation of commendations and role models by cadres in counties, districts, and villages in Jincheng, Yushe, Changzhi, Huguan, and other places in the production movement is worthy of being launched in all parts of our region.

　　开展生产立功运动
    本报“突击下种开展大生产运动”社论中，曾号召在所有干部中展开在生产战线上为人民立功的竞赛运动，保证在生产上打胜仗。晋城县、区、村干部广泛掀起生产、参战立功竞赛，这是推动生产运动加强生产领导的重要步骤，也是生产战线上获得胜利的有力保证。壶关一区及其他地方的经验也已证明，凡在突击点种中能抓紧表功表模，鼓励干部功上加功，组织起来，全力进行生产，就能顺利克服困难，完成计划。而且证明把这个办法贯穿在整个生产过程，造成干部与群众的自觉的行动，大生产运动就会很快开展起来。
    我区广大翻身农民的要求，是组织起来，发展生产，兴家立业，发财致富。但真正把群众的生产热情组织成行动，关键还是决定于领导上的重视，各级干部必须亲自动手，深入群众中去；注意帮助解决群众生产中的困难，提高群众生产自觉，帮助群众组织劳力，造成热烈的群众运动。漠视群众生产，放任自流，就不可能把群众组织起来。晋城、榆社、长治、壶关等地县区村干部在生产运动中开展立功竞赛，贯彻表功表模，值得我在全区各地都开展起来。
