　　Zanhuang Second District: Men, Women, Old and Young All Pitch In
    Planting 2,500 Mu of Cotton in Four Days

    [Report from our newspaper in Zanhuang] After the county-level expansion meeting on the 5th issued the call to launch a cotton planting campaign, all 23 cadres of the Second District, except for the secretary, the correspondent, and the cook, went to various villages to help the masses carry water and plant cotton. After promptly resolving the masses' passive, rain-waiting mentality and the confused idea that the government would demand cotton after the autumn harvest, the district-wide cotton planting movement rapidly and vigorously unfolded. In Dahedao Village, with an actual population of 609, excluding the elderly and children unable to move, all 331 full and auxiliary laborers were fully involved in the cotton planting movement. The village's 120 water buckets were insufficient. In their rush, they cleverly devised a plan to use all six oil drums and three wine jars in the village as water buckets, and even buried two large pots in the ground to hold water to save buckets. Under the leadership of their teachers, 52 students from the Second High School voluntarily ran to the fields to help the masses dig holes, water, and plant cotton. Xiao Zhan'ao, Wang Junni, and Zhao Jinye, women from Caojia Village, unable to find water buckets, used earthenware jars to carry water, saying, "We can't carry less than the men!" Two old men in their fifties or sixties in Shangma Village said while planting cotton, "The Eighth Route Army treats the common people as kindly as elders treat their children, remembering to tell us to plant cotton even after we've been liberated." Yangze Village organized five shock cotton planting work exchange teams to speed up planting and planned to adjust cotton fields. The mutual aid groups in Yuantou Village are also speeding up the shock. Songjia Lane in the village has exceeded the plan of planting three-tenths of a mu of cotton per person. Shangma, Wayao, Xiaojiazhuang, Qijiazhuang, Shenyu and other twenty-three villages are actively acting under the slogan of "Total Mobilization to Shock Plant Cotton." As of the 10th, 2,526.5 mu have been planted in four days. Now the torrent of the district-wide cotton planting movement is surging toward the goal of 3,800 mu.

    [Report from our newspaper in Xingtai] Last year, the people in Longmen Village in the Sixth District who carried water to plant cotton all wore new clothes, while those who relied on rain suffered losses. This year, the masses accepted this lesson and held a group leader meeting on May 1st, deciding that the whole village would organize to carry water and plant cotton. In addition to watering the fields early in the morning and after noon, as of the 10th, they have planted 142 mu of dry land with water in nine days. Forty-three mu of irrigated land have been planted, for a total of 185 mu of cotton. The whole village planted an average of 1.1 mu of cotton per household.

　　赞皇二区男女老少齐动手
    四天点棉二千五百亩
    【本报赞皇讯】从五号县扩干会上提出突击种棉的号召后，二区除留书记、通讯员、伙夫外，全体干部二十三人分赴各村帮助群众担水种棉，经随时解决了群众的消极等雨思想和怕政府秋后要棉花的糊涂想法后，全区植棉运动迅速猛烈展开。大河道全村实有人数六百零九个，除了不能行动的老人和小孩，所有整半辅助劳力三百卅一人完全卷入植棉运动，全村一百二十付水桶不够用，他们忙中生巧计，把村中所有的油桶六个酒篓三个也当水桶用，还找了两口大锅按在地里盛水节省水桶。二高学生在教员的领导下，五十二人自愿跑到地里抢着帮助群众刨坑浇水种棉花。曹家庄妇女萧占熬、王俊妮、赵金叶找不到水桶，便用瓦罐担水，还说：“咱不能比男人们少担！”上麻村两个五、六十岁的老头一边种棉一边说：“八路军看老百姓和老人看孩子们一样亲，叫翻身还记着叫种棉花。”阳泽村组织了五个突击种棉变工队加紧抢种，并计划调剂棉地。院头村的各个互助组也是快马加鞭的突击，该村宋家巷已超过每人三分棉的计划。上麻、瓦窑、肖家庄、齐家庄、申峪等二十三个村都在“全体总动员突击种棉花”的口号下积极行动着，截至十号止四天内已种了二千五百二十六亩五分，现全区植棉运动的洪流正朝着三千八百亩的目的澎湃涌进。

    【本报邢台讯】六区龙门村去年担水栽花的都穿上了新衣服，靠天下雨的吃了亏，今年群众接受了这个经验，于五月一日开了个组长会，决定全村组织起来突击担水栽花，除早起午后不误浇地外，到十日止，九天中旱地担水栽花一百四十二亩。水地栽花四十三亩，共种花一百八十五亩，全村每户平均种花一亩一分。
