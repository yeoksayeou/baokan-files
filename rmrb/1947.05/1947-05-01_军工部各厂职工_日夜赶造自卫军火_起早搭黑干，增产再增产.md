　　Military Industry Department Factory Workers
    Race Day and Night to Manufacture Self-Defense Armaments
    Starting Early and Working Late to Increase Production Again and Again
    [This newspaper dispatch] Inspired by the frequent victories on the front lines, workers in the various military armaments factories of the Military Industry Department are working day and night. Competitions have sprung up in each factory, all striving to become a glorious "Liu Bocheng Factory." In Factory ×, the shift finishes before dawn, and workers start work when the sky is still full of stars. They eat in shifts, and the machines run non-stop from dawn till dusk. Sometimes, they start work as early as 2 a.m. and don't finish until after 5 p.m., working for fourteen hours. The repair section works ten hours during the day, and also puts in three or four hours of voluntary work at night. Comrades He Qingyun, Gong Bingyan, and others continued working despite having sores. Comrade Qi Zhigao, a carpenter, helps the tin workers or completes work when there are no materials. Even with materials, he works as a carpenter during the day and also joins the tin worker comrades in adding voluntary work at night, learning to make landmine barrels. Factory × completed more sheet medicine in March, exceeding the original plan by 60%. The quality was maintained according to the regulations of the Military Industry Office. Thanks to the efforts of all members and improved tools, the production of the gelatinization team increased eighteenfold, and the rejection rate decreased from one-half to one-tenth. They started work at 2 a.m. before dawn and didn't finish until 3 p.m., exhausted and hoarse, but without complaint. One concentrated steaming team steamed concentrated acid exceeding the task by 58%. During the most intense few days, the sulfuric acid vapor burned the faces of workers Shi Huaijin, Guo Xiaotang, and others, but everyone was not afraid for the victory of the self-defense war, applying medicine and continuing to work. In Factory ×, after the mobilization meeting, all workers responded to the call to start all the machines in three days. Comrade Chen Fengshan, an ironworker, took the lead, leading the entire group to work twelve hours on the night of the mobilization meeting, doubling the output. Comrade Yan Suonv, despite breaking her hands in two places, persisted in working. Comrade Li Tingxi, a fitter, completed four mold bases and twenty sets of screws after working several hours of overtime, work that would normally take two days to complete. The movement in Factory × has deepened a step further, with all workers striving to break through the spring production tasks. The output of the two groups led by Xiao Chen and Bai Peitang has increased by 44% since the start of the movement. The iron smelting and machining departments have launched extremely arduous breakthrough movements. The general working hours reach fourteen hours a day, with no rest on Sundays. Some of the tail, fuse, and fin groups stay up all night, or the day shift works until midnight, and the night shift continues to work until the day shift starts work. The completion department originally stipulated a nine-hour system, but everyone insisted on working ten hours, using the extra hour as voluntary work. The movement in each factory is still continuing.
    Transforming Various Tools, Increasing Production Efficiency
    [Another report] In the upsurge of the competition to increase production, various skilled workers have emerged, actively transforming tools, saving raw materials, and improving work efficiency, promoting the development of the movement. In order to support the front line and increase production, the heroes and skilled workers of our factory are actively researching and transforming machines and tools to overcome difficulties in their work. Comrade Wu Zhenchang of Factory × changed a small car for steel head skin. In the past, when the car was on the original car, the highest output per worker was more than six hundred, but now it can produce one thousand two hundred, increasing production by one time and saving an original car and two people. Comrades Shang Wenyuan and Cui Shengguang transformed the pulley on the old drill car, which greatly facilitated the work. If the belt is loose, a pair of long and short ones can be used, saving the labor and time of connecting the belt (the car can run non-stop) and tendon (saving more than two-thirds compared to the past). Comrade Chen Zhaoxiang won three awards in a row: first, he changed a small bullet machine for breaking bullet casings, which doubled the output compared to the past; then, he changed scissors for cutting bundles of bullet wings, which was fast and good to use, and at the same time, the scissors would not be skewed, and the quality was improved a lot; he changed the tool for punching bullet eye, which used to be defective and irregular when punched, but now two eyes are punched at a time, which is good and fast, increasing the output by one time. Comrade Guo Hengdong of Factory × is a newly liberated worker. Under extremely difficult raw material conditions, he repaired a 30-horsepower motor that others could not repair. Cao Peizhi, the foreman of the carpentry team, is a 65-year-old veteran who only joined last year. He is determined to pass on his skills, allowing apprentices to work independently within a year. His attitude is mild and patient, which greatly moves the apprentices.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 27th] The workers of the logistics factories of the Jin Sui Military Region are making every effort to increase production to support the front line. The output of hand grenades in a certain factory is 420% of the same time in the past, and the output of artillery shells is 149.6%. The newly established third factory has only 30% skilled workers, but its production has exceeded the original plan by three times. The department led by labor hero Zhang Qiufeng, workers get up early and go to bed late, and do not rest on Sundays. The output has increased eight times compared to the past. Worker Wang Juwen can complete five days of work in one day. Zhang Fuhai, an apprentice who has been in the factory for a short time, has increased his daily production by more than two times. Shoe factory workers are also rushing to make a large number of military shoes and send them to the front line. Workers Song Yaowu and Li Deqing have increased the number of shoes they make per day from twelve or thirteen pairs to twenty pairs. The production of many workers has increased two or three times, and the products are exceptionally strong.
