　　Zhang Jiuming Mutual Aid Team Would Rather Have Seeds Wait for Rain
    Two Days Planting 400 Mu of Millet

    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 8th dispatch] The Zhang Jiuming Mutual Aid Brigade in Zhangma Village, Qinshui County, started work earliest this spring. After the Lantern Festival, they began delivering manure to the fields, building ridges, and repairing the land. After plowing the land, it did not rain, and the masses wanted to wait for rain before sowing. Zhang Jiuming convened a meeting of group leaders on April 26th. Some said, "It's still early, sowing too early won't sprout." Others said, "If it doesn't rain after sowing, even the seeds will be wasted." Zhang Jiuming said, "We would rather have seeds wait for rain than have rain wait for seeds. Missing the season will ruin the year's crops." Finally, all the group leaders came to a consensus, and they went to each group to discuss it, unifying their opinions. The next day, they started a sudden campaign, planting 400 mu of millet in two days. The entire brigade has a total of 1,234 mu of millet, which can be completely planted within ten days.
    [This newspaper, Licheng dispatch] Under the influence of labor hero Wang Tonghui, the masses of Yantouling in the Sixth District seized the time to plant over 470 mu in ten days. On the first day of the lunar month, the village discussed the sowing work at the people's school. Wang Tonghui said, "It hasn't rained this spring, and we also have to participate in the war. I'm afraid planting too late won't sprout. We must start sowing early." He Chou Nu said, "There are not many people in our village participating in the war yet. We should seize the opportunity and quickly plant millet and cotton." Finally, everyone discussed and came up with a half-month sowing plan and made challenges to each other, with a summary and evaluation every half month. The masses of the Third Team said, "Our team challenges the First Team. If we don't complete the plan, we are willing to lose two <i>laozi</i>." The Second Team then challenged the Fourth Team, and each team also challenged Beipo Village. Under the leadership and influence of labor hero Wang Tonghui and Second Team Leader He Chou Nu, from the first to the eleventh day of the lunar month, statistics show that the whole village has planted 358.5 mu of millet, 38.2 mu of cotton, 41.7 mu of yams, and 34 mu of hemp seeds. They have also planted 9,250 squash seedlings. The whole village has planted a total of 472.4 mu. The sowing can be completed in the next few days. In addition to completing the sowing plan on time, the Second Team also extracted six cattle for transportation, earning over 90,000 yuan. The whole village earned a total of 710,000 yuan.

　　张九铭互助队宁叫籽等雨
    两天种谷四百亩
    【本报太岳八日电】沁水张马村张九铭互助大队，今春开工最早，元宵节后他们就往地里送粪、垒＠、修地。将地犁完，天不下雨，群众都要等雨下种，张九铭便于四月二十六日召集小组长讨论，有的说：“现在还早，种的早了出不来。”有的说：“种上没雨连籽也搭赔了。”张九铭便说：“宁叫籽等雨，不叫雨等籽，误了时节一年的庄稼完蛋了。”最后全体小组长的思想打通了，又分别到各组进行讨论，意见弄一致，第二日便开始突击，两天内种谷四百亩，全大队共有一千二百三十四亩谷子，十天内就可全部种完。
    【本报黎城讯】六区岩头岭群众在劳动英雄王同会影响下，抓紧时间十天下种四百七十余亩。该村于阴历初一在民校讨论下种工作，王同会说：“今年春天没下雨，又要参战，恐怕种的迟了出不来，咱们要提前下种。”何丑女说：“现在咱村的参战人还不多，应抓紧空隙，赶快种谷、种棉。”最后大家讨论出半月下种计划，并互相提出挑战，半月一总结一评选。三队群众说：“我队向一队挑战，如果完不成计划，愿输两面耢子。”二队接着向四队挑战，各队又和北坡庄提出挑战。在劳动英雄王同会与二队队长何丑女的带头与影响下，自初一到十一十天的统计，全村已种谷三百五十八亩五分，已种棉花三十八亩二分，种山药四十一亩七分，种大麻籽三十四亩，还栽了九千二百五十窝南瓜，全村共下种四百七十二亩四分。日内即可全部完成下种。另外二队除按时完成下种计划外，还抽出六犋牲口运输，五十天赚洋九万余元，全村共赚七十一万余元。（怀良、景云、文详、长廷、锦彪、羡渭）
