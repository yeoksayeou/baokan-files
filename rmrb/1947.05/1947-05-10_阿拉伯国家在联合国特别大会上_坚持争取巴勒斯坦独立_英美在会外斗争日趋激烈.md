　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th. Comprehensive reports: The United Nations Special Assembly and its Steering Committee have held continuous meetings from the end of last month to the 3rd of this month. Apart from the continued debate on the scope of the assembly's discussion and whether representatives of Jewish groups should attend the assembly, there has been no progress. Although the Arab states' proposal that the assembly should fully discuss the Palestinian issue and immediately declare Palestine's independence was rejected by the Steering Committee and the Special Assembly, the Arab states are still making every effort to achieve it due to the support of many countries. At the Special Assembly on the 2nd, Chairman Aranha was once forced to declare that the Palestinian issue might be fully discussed. On the other hand, the struggle between the United States and Britain outside the assembly has intensified. According to a French news agency dispatch: A group of Jews supported by the United States recently caused riots in Saronas in Palestine. The British police station and radio station in Saronas were attacked, and 1,300 corpses were piled up at the police station. Mutual killings between Jews and Arabs also occurred in the Tel Aviv area. The central prison in Acre was attacked on the 4th of this month, and some Jewish prisoners escaped. Explosions also occurred on the road from Acre to Haifa.

　　阿拉伯国家在联合国特别大会上
    坚持争取巴勒斯坦独立
    英美在会外斗争日趋激烈
    【新华社陕北六日电】综合报导：联合国特别大会及其指导委员会，自上月底至本月三日连续举行会议，除仍争论大会讨论范围与犹太团体代表是否列席大会之问题外，别无进展。阿拉伯国家所提大会应全盘讨论巴勒斯坦问题立即宣布巴勒斯坦独立一案，虽经指导委员会与特别大会否决，然而由于许多国家的支持，阿拉伯国家仍竭力争取。二日之特别大会上，主席阿兰哈曾一度被迫宣称，巴勒斯坦问题或将全部讨论。另一方面，美英在会外的斗争又趋激烈。据法新闻处电讯：由美国所支持的一部分犹太人近又在巴勒斯坦之沙罗那骚动，沙罗那英方警察局与广播电台等均遭袭击，警察局堆集死尸一千三百具。特乐阿米克地区亦发生犹太人与阿拉伯人互相残杀事件。亚克之中央监狱，于本月四日遭受袭击，若干犹太犯人逃逸，亚克到海法的路上并发生爆炸事件。
