Xinhua News Agency, Jinji-Luyu, 7th: Two hundred and fifty thousand laborers in Hebei-Shandong-Henan are undertaking a second large-scale rush to repair the Yellow River dykes from Changhui to Qihe, to prevent the impending "flood season." In areas occupied and controlled by the Chiang army, the democratic government is calling on the people to seize every possible opportunity to rush repairs and save themselves. Another dispatch: The Southern Hebei Administrative Office has called on the people of the area to assist the people of Hebei-Shandong-Henan in rushing the repair of the Yellow River embankments. Thirty thousand people from Qingping, Shenxian, Guanxian, Yuanchao and other counties, carrying tools, have rushed to the north bank of the Yellow River overnight, preparing to massively expand the 250-li-long dyke from Puyang to Zhangqiu, which is expected to begin on the 15th of this month.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinji-Luyu, 6th: The Chiang army is building fortifications on the south bank of the Yellow River, shelling workers repairing dykes and peaceful residents in the liberated areas on the north bank day and night. In Kunwu Seventh District, which is only twenty li long along the river, the Chiang army has built nine blockhouses and pillboxes. Twenty-one residents on the north bank have been killed or wounded by Chiang army shelling. Residents along the bank, unable to endure it any longer, have risen up in self-defense, established joint defense, and provided cover for dyke repair work. The forty-li-long dam in the Wangziyu area has been largely completed.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 6th: Shanghai newspapers revealed that after the Yellow River returned to its old course, due to the Chiang government's failure to take any water conservancy measures in advance, the Yellow River flooded areas in Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces have become deserts, with thousands of miles of barren land. The once "granary of Henan" has now become a landscape of yellow sand, where not a blade of grass grows. Thousands of returning farmers arrive daily, all sleeping in the yellow sand, without food, clothing, or any possibility of cultivation. The "Yellow Flood Area Inspection Team" also stated that the area west of Fugou, bordering Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces, will become a new desert in the world. Note: This is another disaster area created by Chiang Kai-shek using the Yellow River to drown the people in the old course, while also creating a new disaster area within the Yellow Flood Zone.

　　冀鲁豫二十五万民工
    抢修堤坝预防伏汛
    冀南三万民众前往协助
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫七日电】冀鲁豫二十五万民工第二次大规模抢修长辉至齐河段黄河堤坝，预防不久即将到来的“伏汛”。在蒋军侵占与控制地区，民主政府号召民众尽一切可能抓紧空隙抢修自救。又讯：冀南行署号召该区人民协助冀鲁豫人民赶修黄河堤岸。清平、莘县、冠县、元朝等县三万民众，已携带工具星夜赶至黄河北岸，准备大举增修濮阳至张秋二百五十里长的大堤，预计本月十五日即可动工。
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫六日电】蒋军在黄河南岸大修工事，昼夜炮击北岸解放区复堤工员与和平居民。昆吾七区沿河仅长二十余里，蒋军即筑有炮楼碉堡九座。北岸居民被蒋军炮击死伤者已达二十一人，沿岸居民忍无可忍，奋起自卫，成立联防，掩护抢修堤工。王子鱼一带长四十里之堤坝，已大部竣工。
    【新华社华中六日电】沪报透露：黄河归故后，因蒋政府事前并未作任何水利措施，豫、皖、苏三省黄河泛滥区已成沙漠，赤地千里。昔为“河南谷仓”之大平原上，今遍地黄沙，寸草不长；回籍农民，日有千余人，均露宿于黄沙中，衣食无着，更无耕种可言。“黄泛区视察团”亦称：扶沟以西毗邻豫、皖、苏三省地带将成世界上新沙漠。按：此乃蒋介石以黄水淹杀故道人民造成新灾区，同时在黄泛区内所造成之又一灾区。
