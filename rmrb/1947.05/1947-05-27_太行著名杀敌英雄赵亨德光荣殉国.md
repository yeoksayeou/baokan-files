　　Taihang's Renowned Heroic Enemy Killer
  　Zhao Hengde Gloriously Dies for His Country
    [Report from this newspaper] Comrade Zhao Hengde, a famous enemy-killing hero from Taihang, gloriously sacrificed his life at 3:00 AM on April 19th during the Panshi and Zhuangwo battles of the Zhengtai Campaign. When the tragic news spread, the soldiers and civilians of Taihang were filled with grief and indignation, sparking an even fiercer wave of revenge and killing of the enemy. Note: Comrade Zhao Hengde was only 26 years old. He joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1938. He rose from a soldier to battalion commander through meritorious service. Before his sacrifice, he served as the Chief of Staff of a certain regiment in the Taihang Second Military Sub-district. During the nine years of the Anti-Japanese War and the year-plus of the Patriotic Self-Defense War, he was infinitely loyal to the people's cause and unafraid of sacrifice and bloodshed, having been wounded seven times. Especially during the unprecedentedly severe and cruel struggle against the enemy in 1941 and 1942, he fought behind enemy lines, braving death, and frequently cut off the enemy's important transportation line, the Zhengtai Railway. At the Taihang Hero Congress in the winter of 1944, he was awarded the title of First-Class Enemy-Killing Hero of the entire district's soldiers. In the spring of 1945, his brilliant achievement of capturing Lieutenant General Suzuki Kawasaburo, a senior advisor to the Japanese invaders in Shanxi, and nine others on the Zhengtai Railway, further boosted morale. The Japanese and puppet troops turned pale at the mention of him, calling him the "Roadblock Tiger." In the year of the Patriotic Self-Defense War, he successively organized and participated in over a hundred battles such as Changning, Yangyi, and Suohuang, making great contributions to the persistence and development of the situation in the Taihang Second Military Sub-district. His glorious sacrifice this time is indeed a major loss for the people and our army. Currently, the soldiers and civilians of Taihang are launching an even fiercer offensive against Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan to complete the martyr's unfinished cause and avenge the hero.

　　太行著名杀敌英雄
  　赵亨德光荣殉国
    【本报讯】太行闻名杀敌英雄赵亨德同志，于四月十九日晨三时，在正太战役磐石、庄窝战斗中，光荣牺牲，噩耗传出，太行军民悲愤交集，激起更猛烈的复仇杀敌怒潮。按：赵亨德同志，现年仅廿六岁，三八年加入中国共产党。由战士积功跃升至营长，牺牲前，任太行二分区某团参谋长。在九年抗日战争与一年余爱国自卫战争中，对人民事业无限忠诚，不畏牺牲流血，曾先后负伤七次之多。特别是在四一、四二年空前严重残酷的对敌斗争中，转战敌后，出生入死，敌重要交通线正太路，时遭切断。一九四四年冬太行群英大会上曾荣获全区子弟兵一等杀敌英雄。四五年春，正太路上捕捉日寇山西省高级顾问铃木川三郎少将等九人的辉煌战绩，更振奋人心，日伪谈虎色变，称之为“搁路虎”。在一年的爱国自卫战争中，先后组织与参加了长凝、阳邑、锁簧等百余次战斗，对太行二分区局面坚持与开展贡献极大。此次光荣殉国，实为人民及我军的重大损失。现太行军民，正向蒋阎发动更猛烈的攻势，完成烈士的未竟事业，为英雄复仇。
