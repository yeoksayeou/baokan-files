No Force Can Subdue Them!
Liberated Chiang Officers Talk About Their Experiences in Taiwan
Haitao
After the "February 28th" massacre, six million Taiwanese compatriots launched a great movement and struggle demanding autonomy. To understand the causes of this movement in more detail, I specifically interviewed five officers from the Kuomintang's direct line troops, the 70th Division, 140th Brigade, known as the "Taiwan Garrison Division," who laid down their weapons during the Yutai campaign.

Zeng Jiamo was the acting company commander of the service company of the 140th Brigade.
Xiong Dengyun was the captain deputy battalion commander of the 1st Battalion of the 280th Regiment of the 140th Brigade.
Zhou Wu was a young man from Zhejiang, serving as a lieutenant company instructor in the 280th Regiment.
Pan Guoguang was a lieutenant platoon leader in the 280th Regiment.
And there was also Wu Hanzhen, a second lieutenant communications officer in the brigade headquarters.

What they introduced to me included the blood and tears of six million people, the countless crimes of the Four Families, and the five of their own resentment towards the rulers of Taiwan and joy for the victory of the Taiwanese people!

The six million compatriots in Taiwan suffered all kinds of hardships after Taiwan was taken over by central officials led by the traitor Chen Yi. Zeng Jiamo said, "The common people called Chen Yi 'pig liver' (because its pronunciation is similar to the words 'in charge'). In butcher shops, you could often hear the curse 'buy half a catty of Chen Yi'... See how much the common people hated him!"

Then, the young communications officer told me that he once saw a large mural on the wall, depicting a central official in a Zhongshan suit, and the two pockets were drawn particularly large, taking up half of the jacket; he was very curious about what this meant, but a fellow villager told him: "Your Zhongshan pockets are too big, all the money of the Taiwanese people is filled by you!" From then on, the phrase "Zhongshan pockets" became popular in Taiwan. "Damn it, the big officials get rich, and we get scolded!" Wu Hanzhen angrily finished this story.

The big officials seized factories, stole and sold the machines, and smuggled the raw materials, resulting in the closure of factories and tens of thousands of people without food; Chen Yi established many wine, sugar, tobacco, salt, and fertilizer monopoly bureaus in eight counties and nine cities..., and called his younger brother Chen Gongquan to manage these money-making agencies. What was called the Taiwan Governor-General's Office was actually his private property, just as your newspaper said, "monopoly, manipulation," but it "tormented" the Taiwanese people!

"Prices are 'flying' every day!" Zeng Jiamo emphasized the word "flying" in a forceful tone, telling me that this was caused by the multiplicity and severity of taxes. There was nothing that was not taxed there. Killing a pig was taxed, watching a play was taxed, and eating a meal of one hundred yuan also required a tax of twenty yuan. The train from Chiayi to Taipei cost three cents in Japanese times, and later it cost twenty-five yuan (Taiwan currency). "How can the people live like this!" Several people sighed together. Zhou Wu further supplemented that the average tax amount for hotels and businesses had to reach a height of forty percent. No wonder all Taiwanese people called Chen Yi "King of the South" and "Local Emperor." Indeed, he was too outrageous! "Damn it, he did so many bad things in Fujian, and the Fujianese kicked him off the stage, but Chiang Kai-shek made him Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, President of the Army University, and President of the Central Cadre Training Corps, and then made him the head of Taiwan after the victory. He's simply a bastard!" Pan Guoguang, a native of Fuzhou, Fujian, angrily denounced Chen Yi after Zhou Wu finished scolding.

"'What the superiors do, the subordinates follow.' I heard that Lu Guichang, the magistrate of Taipei County, embezzled more than 1 million Taiwan dollars in just half a year. Others even smaller, even some squad leaders in our队伍 could steal gasoline and sell it, and fill it with water to make up the difference. Damn it, no one doesn't embezzle." The youngest Wu Hanzhen cursed like this, followed by many unforgettable facts: how the Air Force ground crew stole and sold parts and gasoline, and all the "big becoming small" and "small becoming non-existent" embezzlement methods created by the takeover personnel. Because of the uneven takeover, the garrison troops and Chen Yi's group had conflicts. The "Iron Rooster" was performed at the Senate, and Wang Tao, the commander of the 62nd Army, was finally dismissed because Chen's backstage was strong. A conflict occurred between the military and police in Taipei City, resulting in the death of nine military police (in the tragic case on New Year's Day the year before)... Everyone shook their heads while angrily turning over this disgraceful family history of the "King of the South" and his lackeys.

"Didn't the Chiang government investigate and deal with these things?" I asked.

Zhou Wu said, "Don't even mention it. Last year in June and July, the Japanese property investigation group headed by Liu Wendao arrived in Taiwan, and the result was a big fanfare. Although the directors of the monopoly and trade bureaus were detained, they immediately 'returned to their posts' as soon as the investigation group left! When Liu Wendao was about to leave, he also said, 'Things are difficult to handle, everything depends on the decision of Governor Chen Yi!'"

"Many people are hungry and want to work, and many warehouses are left unattended... but these guys are busy marrying Taiwanese concubines. It became a trend at that time."

From these angry accusations, they solved my question - the real reason for the February 28th Incident in Taiwan. Just as Xiong Yingfu said: "Because they are unwilling to be subjected to the bloody rule of the Chiang family, six million people want autonomy, and no force can subdue them!"

　　啥力量都压不倒他们！
    被解放的蒋军官谈驻台湾时的见闻
    海涛
    “二二八”惨案以后，六百万台湾同胞掀起了要求自治的伟大行动与斗争，为了更详细具体的了解这一运动的起因，我特去访问了驻扎台湾一年半号称“台湾警备师”的国民党嫡系部队——七十师一四○旅的五个军官，他们是在鱼台作战时放下武器的。
    曾家谟是一四○旅的勤务连代理连长。
    熊登云是一四○旅二八○团一营的上尉副营长。
    周武是浙江一个青年，在二八○团担任中尉连指导员。
    潘国光是二八○团的中尉排长。
    还有一个在旅部担任少尉通讯士的伍汉祯。
    他们所介绍给我的，有六百万人民的血泪，也有四大家族那些说不完的罪恶，还有他们五个人对台湾统治者的愤恨和对台湾人民胜利的欢喜！
    ×        ×        ×          ×
    台湾六百万同胞，在汉奸陈仪为首的中央大员劫收了台湾后，受尽了苦难，曾家谟说：“老百姓把陈仪都叫“猪肝”（因与“主管”二字的音相似），在肉铺里经常可以听到“买陈仪半斤”的咒骂……，你看老百姓恨到什么程度了！”
    接着，年轻的通讯士又告诉我，他一次看到墙上画了一幅很大的壁画，一个穿着中山服的中央大员代表，而那两个口袋画得特别大，竟占了上衣的一半；他很奇怪这是什么意思，但老乡告诉他：“你们的中山袋太大了，台湾老百姓的钱都被你们装满哪！”从此“中山袋”之语，便流行台湾。“妈的，大官发财，咱们挨骂！”伍汉祯气愤着说完了这个故事。
    大员们劫收工厂，把机器盗卖了，原料走了私，结果弄得工厂关门，几万人没有饭吃；陈仪在八个县九个市里成立了许多酒、糖、烟、盐、肥料专卖局……，把他的弟弟陈公铨叫来掌管这些发财机关，名为台湾长官公署的，实际上都是他的私产，正是像你们报上说的“垄断，操纵”，可是把台湾人民“整”苦啦！
    “物价天天在‘飞’呵！”曾家谟用有力的语气加重了“飞”字，他告诉我这是因为税的繁多和苛重而造成的。那里没有一样不抽税的，杀猪要抽税，看戏要加税，吃饭上一百元的也要抽二十元的税，火车从嘉义坐到台北日本人在时是三角钱，以后到了二十五元，（台币）“你看人民怎么能过下去呢！”几个人在共同的叹息。周武又补充了使旅馆和经营商业的税额平均要达到百分之四十的高度，难怪所有台湾人民把陈仪叫“南面王”“土皇帝”。的确他也太不像样了！“妈的，他在福建干了那么多坏事，福建人把他搞下了台，而蒋介石又让他干行政院秘书长，陆大教育长，中央干训团的教育长，胜利后又主政台湾，简直是混蛋！”福建福州人潘国光在周武骂完了之后，又狠狠的把陈仪诉说了一顿。
    “‘上行下效’，我听说台北县县长陆贵昌，在短短的半年就贪污了台币一百多万，其他那些更小的，甚至连我们队伍中的一些班长之类都能将汽油偷去卖了，而把里面灌上水充数，他妈的，没人不贪污的。”年纪最小的伍汉祯这样的咒骂着，接着就是许多让人记不完的事实：空军地勤部队如何盗卖零件、汽油，一切劫收人员所创造的“大的变小的”“小的变无有”的贪污办法。因为劫收的不均，而使驻军与陈仪那一伙闹矛盾，在参议会上演出“铁公鸡”，终因陈的后台硬，而将六十二军军长王涛撤职，在台北市军宪发生冲突，结果打死了九个宪兵（在前年的元旦的惨案）……，大家都在一边摇头，一边愤怒地翻起这一笔“南面王”和它的走卒的家丑。
    “蒋政府难道就没有调查与处置这些事情吗？”我问了一句。
    周武就说：“不用提了，去年六七月，以刘文岛为头的接收日产清查团到了台湾，结果是放了一顿大炮，虽然把专卖，贸易局长扣了起来，清查团一走，马上又“各就各位”了！在刘文岛临走时还说“事情很难处理，一切均依靠陈仪长官裁决吧！”
    “许多人饿着要工做，许多仓库放着没有人管……而这些家伙却忙着娶台湾姨太太，那时竟形成了风气。”
    从这些愤怒的控诉里，他们解决了我的疑问——台湾二二八事变的真实原因。也正像熊营附说的：“因为不愿再受蒋家的血腥统治，所以六百万人民就要自治，啥力量都压不倒他们！”
