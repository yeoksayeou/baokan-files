(By our correspondent from Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 13th) Liberated peasants in various parts of Hebei-Shandong-Henan are moving into new houses in succession. At a peasant conference in the third district of Puyang County, the masses decided through public vote that April 22nd would be an auspicious day for moving. On that day, from dawn till dusk, the sound of gongs and drums celebrating the move and slogans resounded throughout the district. In Sanlidian, first district, a major relocation took place on April 21st. On that day, about 200 men, women, and children from the entire village joyfully escorted three military dependents' families and one poor peasant family to their new houses amidst the sounds of gongs and drums. In Xijie of Nanle city, the problem of housing for military dependents and impoverished peasants was resolved. Everyone discussed the number of houses to be allocated based on the number of people without housing, and collectively escorted them to their new homes. The masses, holding brooms and shovels, and the sisters' corps and children's corps, singing songs and shouting slogans of celebration, helped more than ten families move. Newly composed couplets were pasted on the doors of the houses. The new owners said, "If it weren't for Chairman Mao, the poor would never have such joy!"
