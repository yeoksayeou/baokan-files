　　Jincheng County and District Cadres Show Great Enthusiasm
　　Launching Production Emulation Drive
　　Cadres in Changzhi's First District All Plan to Add Merit Upon Merit
　　[Our Newspaper] This month, Jincheng convened a meeting of village chiefs, heads of farmers' associations, and cadres from various districts. Everyone was delighted to hear the news of victory from the front lines and said, "If the soldiers at the front can kill enemies and earn merit, can't we earn merit in the rear?" The old hero of Tianshuiling proposed, "Chairman Mao deserves the greatest credit for our peasants' ability to turn over. We must repay his kindness and earn merit. Our Tianshuiling has a total of forty-nine mutual aid teams. I guarantee that all of them can achieve voluntary combination and fair exchange of labor. We have twenty looms and guarantee to have over fifty by autumn. Cadres will lead the way in providing civilian laborers, ensuring no desertion. We are willing to challenge Jinmiaopu with the above conditions." Jinmiaopu immediately rose to accept the challenge, outlining their own merit-earning plan. The Sixth District challenged the Seventh District: (1) Cadres will participate personally to consolidate 115 mutual aid teams; (2) The entire district already has 2,870 women participating in agricultural labor. We will strive to reach 7,200 women by autumn, with 104 women learning to plow, harrow, carry manure, drive carts, and other complete skills; (3) Cadres will lead participation in the war effort, ensuring no desertion of civilian laborers, etc. The Seventh District responded to the challenge: (1) In the old areas, 60% of male laborers and 40% of female laborers will be organized; in the new areas, 50% of male laborers and 30% of female laborers will be organized. The entire district will increase the yield of coarse grains by one dou per mu, with half the district achieving "cultivating three and surplus one," and half the district eating well and being well-clothed; (2) We guarantee that the burden payments, public grain, and military shoes will be entirely solved by sideline occupations, without using a single grain from the fields, etc. The Eighth District challenged the Fifth District: (1) We are determined to extend the merit-earning movement deeply into the masses, with district cadres personally participating in labor; (2) Among the 768 military families and cadres' families in the entire district, we will strive for 70% to voluntarily participate in labor before the wheat harvest, and cultivate one model military family or cadre family in each village; (3) Millet will be hoed three times, cotton will be hoed five times, increasing the yield of fine grains by three sheng per mu, and guaranteeing that 80% of the autumn plowing will be completed. Subsequently, villages and districts all proposed: "We must repay Chairman Mao's kindness! We must earn merit!" Cadres in each village are determined not only to earn merit themselves but also to mobilize all the villagers to earn merit! Let's have a county-wide "Repay Kindness and Earn Merit" movement in Jincheng County! The conference concluded with a discussion of merit-earning plans, and the enthusiasm of district and village cadres was very high. Comrade Zheng Siyuan, the county party secretary, and County Chief Yang were also present at the meeting and shared their own merit-earning plans with everyone. First, Comrade Zheng said, "My merit-earning plan is: 1. Personally lead civilian laborers to participate in the war effort at least once; 2. Turn in 10,000 yuan to the public from production and savings, with 5,000 yuan before the wheat harvest; 3. Personally participate in a mutual aid team, work in the fields with the masses, gain experience, and promote it throughout the county." County Chief Yang also proposed four merit-earning plans: 1. Personally participate in and improve a mutual aid team, go to the fields to work with the masses, achieve voluntary combination, equal exchange, democratic leadership, realize "cultivating three and surplus one," and do a good job in combining war support and production; 2. Guarantee to personally lead civilian laborers to participate in the war effort at least once, do a good job in political work, and strive to achieve no desertions, and personally carry a wounded soldier at least once; 3. Turn in 10,000 yuan to the public from production and savings to support the front lines, with 5,000 yuan turned in during the first half of the year; 4. Personally take on a portion of logistical work, help the guards establish household affairs, and help them generate an income of over 5,000 yuan to solve their family difficulties. Seeing that the county secretary and county chief had personally made merit-earning plans, everyone shouted, "We have to work hard!" (Jincheng Laboring People's Small Newspaper)
　　[Our Newspaper] At the district and village cadre meeting in Changzhi's First District on the tenth and eleventh, after commending and modeling to inspire the cadres' enthusiasm for production, everyone enthusiastically responded to the call from above, determined to be models in turning over and heroes in production. District and village cadres all set merit-earning standards.
　　Labor Hero Zhao Changhao set conditions: (1) Guarantee that 80% of the village's male and female full and semi-laborers are organized, and implement work points. (2) Guarantee that participation in the war effort and production are not delayed, and transport grain without hiring a single person or wasting money. Li Cun, director of the Armed Forces Committee of Guan Village, set merit-earning conditions: (1) Guarantee that 80% of the village's male and female full laborers are organized, and implement work points. (2) Guarantee to promote the purchase of ten mules in the whole village after autumn. (3) Major exchange of labor for participation in the war effort and production, without hiring a single person. In addition to these, many other village cadres set merit-earning standards. Each of the district cadres also set merit-earning standards: Guan Lianjun, Civil Affairs Assistant, established the following merit plan: (1) Transform Nanzhai Consumer Cooperative into a Production Cooperative; (2) Cultivate a model group and a heroic individual; (3) Resolve the disunity of the Nanzhai village cadres, untangle the knots, and mobilize village cadres to fully lead production. Other district cadre comrades have all made plans according to their own strength. At the next meeting, we will evaluate achievements to see who is better.
