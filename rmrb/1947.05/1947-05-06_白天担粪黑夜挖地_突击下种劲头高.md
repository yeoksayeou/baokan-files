　　【Report from Lucheng, this newspaper】When Xifenshang Village was rectifying the mutual aid teams, the masses had many complaints because the mutual aid team labor last year did not implement equal exchange, with uneven distribution of hardship and enjoyment, and the wage rice was also handled carelessly. This year, at the beginning, a method for determining points was discussed, and it was decided to determine points based on labor, with one day divided into ten points, each point worth half a jin of rice. Everyone agreed, and five teams were voluntarily organized at any time. Sui Renhe of the first team had the greatest enthusiasm. He carried manure during the day and dug the earth at night, digging eleven mu of land in sixteen nights. Yao Shuize of the second team is sixty-three years old and digs eight fen of land every day. The enthusiasm for spring plowing in each team was generally mobilized, and they worked early and late. In ten days, they dug 635 mu of land. In addition to plowing one qing of land with four animals, the autumn land has now been completely prepared, and they are about to prepare for sowing.

　　【Another report】Beicheng Town called for mutual aid and large-scale production during spring plowing, and the whole village automatically organized thirty-two mutual aid teams. Among them, ten militiamen serve as mutual aid team leaders. These ten teams have a total of sixty-two full laborers and twenty-five half laborers, with a total of 905 mu of land. They are now determined to completely cultivate all the land before the tenth day of the third lunar month and guarantee that all will be sown by the thirteenth. They are very enthusiastic, working early and late every day, and becoming more energetic every day. Under their influence, all thirty-two mutual aid teams in the village are working in the same way.

　　【This newspaper reports】Since Gaoping Shimocun复查 (fucha - review and reinvestigation) cut off the feudal vestiges and distributed the remaining fruits, the masses have been in high spirits to step up spring ploughing production. The whole village has more than 100 full laborers. Under the leadership of Village Chief Li Zongling, 24 mutual aid teams were organized. During the meeting, each team proposed to guarantee that no field in the village would be left barren and no one would be idle. They planned to complete the spring plowing task of the whole village in 20 days. At the same time, in order to expand this year's large-scale production movement and solve the clothing problem of the whole village, they began to help each other after Qingming, digging border lands, carrying manure, and plowing the land. In about ten days, the village planted more than 400 mu of cotton, averaging one mu of cotton for every ten mu of land. In addition to planting millet and miscellaneous grains, they also plan to plant two to three hundred mu of sesame and hemp. Qiu Cun's Meng Xianfu and Niu Hairong are afraid that drought will delay the cotton planting, so they carry water and rush to plant. Su Shouyi's family of four has already rushed to plant 1.2 mu of cotton and will plant three to four more mu. Most of the villagers have exceeded the plan of four people per mu of cotton.
