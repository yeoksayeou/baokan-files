Literary Correspondence Call for Submissions Regulations

    In order to better understand the literary activities in various front-line areas and the mass literary activities in rural areas such as Yangge dances, operas, and drum ballads, and to exchange experiences and establish connections, the Border Region Federation of Literary and Art Circles has created a Literary Correspondence column on page four of the People's Daily. It is tentatively scheduled to be published semi-monthly. We hope that comrades from literary and art federations, propaganda and education departments, cultural work troupes, and theater troupes in various regions will provide more assistance and contribute enthusiastically! This publication welcomes the following types of manuscripts:

    I. News reports of various art activities.
    II. Investigation and research on the organization and work of rural theater troupes, Yangge teams, and drum ballad teams.
    III. Snippets of experience and creations in various art activities, such as reforming old operas and old artists.
    IV. Book and newspaper introductions, short literary reviews, and discussions on various issues related to literary and art activities.

    Manuscripts should focus on practicality, be concise and incisive; reports on situations and statistics from investigations should be as accurate as possible. Submissions should be sent to the Editorial Department of the Border Region Federation of Literary and Art Circles, c/o Yetao Post Office, Wu'an.
