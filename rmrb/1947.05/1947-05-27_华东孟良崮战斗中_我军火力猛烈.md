Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 25th: On the afternoon of May 15th, People's Liberation Army forces attacking the 74th Division at Menglianggu stormed the mountain from all directions, and the Chiang troops retreated like a tide to the 600 Heights. At this time, a unit of the People's Liberation Army had completely controlled the 540 Heights and concentrated fire on the 600 Heights. Chiang's troops scurried about on the mountaintop, and many horses jumped around in panic. The sound of Chiang's troops firing was almost inaudible. The firepower of the People's Liberation Army completely overwhelmed them. Chiang's troops desperately waved white aerial liaison flags, but the ammunition and food dropped by Chiang's planes fell into the positions of the People's Liberation Army. In the afternoon, the sound of the general attack was heard. The People's Liberation Army charged towards the 600 Heights from all the hilltops. Chiang's troops retreated in panic to the peak cliffs and large stone valleys. Zhang, the battalion commander of the People's Liberation Army, used the mountain guns he had just seized to bombard Chiang's troops. Bi Wenxing, an artilleryman from the 58th Brigade of Chiang's troops who had just laid down his weapons, requested permission to join the shelling and was granted. He excitedly aimed at the Chiang's troops' position and fired more than fifty rounds in one go. The Chiang's troops on the mountain were in chaos. The People's Liberation Army soldiers immediately launched a political offensive, shouting slogans such as "Those who surrender will not be killed" and "Lenient treatment for those who surrender." Suddenly, a Chiang soldier in the northwest corner of Shanxi waved a small white flag, and the mountain was filled with cries of "Surrender, I surrender." The People's Liberation Army soldiers immediately stopped all firearms. Chiang's troops poured out from caves and valleys, holding their hands high and walking down the mountain in a long line. Piles of light and heavy weapons, groups of war horses, and countless military supplies lay scattered on the mountain, waiting for the People's Liberation Army to collect and process.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 24th: The newly established local corps in central Shandong rendered meritorious service in the Menglianggu campaign, cooperating in annihilating the enemy. When the 74th Division of the General was surrounded and annihilated, the advancing 75th Division of Chiang's troops immediately contracted backward, attempting to reinforce. On the morning of the 16th, a regiment of the division was ambushed by a unit of the People's Local Armed Forces in Gaoyipu area, south of Mengyinzhai. After four hours of fierce fighting, more than 40 enemies were killed, achieving the purpose of delaying the enemy's actions.

Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 25th: Shandong's famous shooting hero, Wei Laiguo, was delighted to hear of the great victory at Menglianggu while recuperating from his injuries, saying: "The complete annihilation of the 74th Division shows that all of Chiang Kai-shek's troops can be annihilated. If the Chiang's troops attacking the liberated areas do not lay down their weapons, they will inevitably suffer the same fate as the 74th Division sooner or later." The hero further stated: "In the Second Self-Defense War, I have killed more than 360 enemies. The killing plan for the defensive battle has been exceeded three times, but the killing figures for the annihilation battle have not yet been completed." He raised his injured right hand and said, "Now the index finger can be bent, and the thumb can move slightly, and I will soon be able to return to the front line."

　　华东孟良崮战斗中
  　我军火力猛烈
    【新华社华东前线二十五日电】五月十五日下午，围攻孟良崮七十四师的人民解放军，从四面八方攻上山去，蒋军像潮水似的退到六○○高地。此时，解放军某部已经完全控制五四○高地，并集中火力向六○○高地射击。蒋军在山顶上窜来窜去，许多马匹也惊慌地乱蹦乱跳，简直听不到蒋军的射击声。解放军的火力完全压倒了他们。蒋军绝望地摆动着白色的对空联络旗，然而蒋机扔下的弹药和食物落到了解放军的阵地。下午响起了总攻击的号声。解放军从各个山头冲向六○○高地。蒋军慌乱地退缩到高峰悬崖和大石谷间。解放军张营长把才缴到的山炮，向蒋军轰击。一个才放下武器的蒋军五十八旅炮兵毕文行请求参加炮击被允准了，他兴奋地瞄准蒋军阵地，一气打了五十多发。山上蒋军乱做一团。解放军勇士们立即展开政治攻势，喊起“缴枪不杀”、“缴枪优待”的口号。突然，山西北角一个蒋军摇着小白旗，山上是一片“缴枪、我缴枪”的呼叫。解放军勇士们立即停止了一切火器。蒋军从山洞里、山谷间蜂拥出来，高举双手，拉成一长长的行列走下山来。山头上一堆堆杂乱地放着的轻重火器，成群的战马，无数军用品，等着解放军去收拾处理。
    【新华社山东二十四日电】孟良崮战役中，鲁中新成立之地方兵团立功，配合歼敌。当将军七十四师被围歼时，北进之蒋军七十五师即向后收缩，妄图增援，十六日晨，该师一个团为人民地方武装一部堵击于蒙阴寨以南的高义铺一带，激战四小时，歼敌四十余，达成延迟敌军行动之目的。
    【新华社华东前线二十五日电】山东著名射击英雄魏来国于养伤期间闻孟良崮大捷，欣谓：“七十四师被彻底歼灭，说明蒋介石一切军队都可以被歼灭。如果进攻解放区的蒋军不放下武器，都必然迟早要遭受和七十四师一样的命运。”英雄复称：“第二次自卫战中，我已杀敌三百六十余名。守备战的杀敌计划已超过三倍，歼灭战则尚未完成杀敌数字。”他举起负伤的右手说：“现在食指已能弯屈，拇指已能微动，不久即可重上前线。”
