　　Expressing the Wisdom of New Heroes
　　Liu Beigeng
　　The play "Wang Keqin Class" has been appraised by commanders and fighters as an excellent work with practical educational significance. Each performance has greatly promoted and exemplified the mutual aid movement, training movement, and advocacy of combat styles that combine wisdom and courage in our troops.

　　The success of "Wang Keqin Class" has opened up a new path for our military's artistic work, which is the path indicated by Chairman Mao that "all revolutionary struggles of the people must be praised." Military artistic activities must portray new heroes of the masses, must express the creativity and wisdom of new heroes, and must attach great importance to the ideological and educational significance of artistic works. Our soldiers like to see their own heroes, and they especially like their heroes to be smart, brave, and progressive soldiers, because new heroes are the typification of countless soldiers. Commending hero models is the best educational method, and this experience has been proven once again in "Wang Keqin Class."

　　Why can "Wang Keqin Class" have such significant results? Of course, this is not accidental. It is because we have recognized and achieved "serving the soldiers." Only after we have clearly established the idea of "serving the soldiers" can we go deep into the troops, humbly learn from soldiers and heroes, and express the intelligence and talent of the masses and heroes.

　　If we recall the failures of many dramas in the past, it can help us further cherish the gains of "Wang Keqin Class." In the past, some of us portrayed soldiers as foolish and mischievous characters such as "simpletons," "scarface Zhang," "playful commander," and "stubborn bunkers," which naturally aroused resentment from the soldiers, and as a result, there was no educational significance. The reason for such shortcomings is due to a lack of belief in the wisdom of the soldiers, a lack of understanding of the soldiers' lives and demands, and a lack of understanding that without portraying the soldiers' own heroes, it will inevitably be unpopular with our soldiers. No problem, this painful lesson will not be repeated.

　　In the patriotic self-defense war, countless heroes are continuing to emerge. If we can follow the creative direction of "Wang Keqin Class," then it can be believed that many good works will be produced.

### 表现新英雄的智慧

　　表现新英雄的智慧
    刘备耕
    剧作《王克勤班》，已为部队指战员同志评定为有实际教育意义的优秀作品；它的每一次演出，对于我们部队的互助运动，练兵运动及提倡智勇结合的战斗作风，都起了很大的推动作用和示范作用。
    《王克勤班》的成功，给我们部队文艺工作开辟了一条崭新的道路，这就是毛主席所指示的“一切人民群众的革命斗争必须歌颂之”的道路，部队文艺活动必须表现群众的新英雄，必须表现新英雄的创造和智慧，必须十分重视文艺作品的思想教育意义。我们的战士喜欢看自己的英雄，他们更喜欢自己的英雄是一个很聪明，很勇敢，很进步的战士，因为新英雄是无数战士的典型化。表扬英雄模范是最好的教育方法，这一个经验在《王克勤班》也再一次的被证明了。
    为什么《王克勤班》能有这样显著的成果呢？当然这不是偶然的，它是由于我们认识了和做到了“为兵服务”。在我们明确树立了“为兵服务”的思想之后，才有可能深入部队，虚心向士兵、向英雄学习，并表现了群众和英雄的聪明才智。
    如果我们回忆一下过去有许多剧作的失败，就可以帮助我们进一步珍贵“王克勤班”的收获。以前我们有人把战士描写成“二不楞”，“张大疤”，“佻皮司令”，“顽固碉堡”等愚蠢的胡闹的角色，自然引起战士们的反感，结果就谈不到什么教育意义。产生这样缺点的原因，是由于不相信战士的智慧，不了解战士的生活和要求，不懂得如果没有表现战士自己的英雄，必然不受我们战士的欢迎。没有问题，这个痛苦的教训再也不会重复了。
    在爱国自卫战争中正继续涌现出无数的英雄人物，假若我们能够走《王克勤班”的创作方向，那末可以相信，将会产生许多好的作品。
