　　Beiping Wang Repairs Canal to Prevent Drought
  　Eighty Mu of Land Transformed into Paddy Fields
    [Our Newspaper, Zanhuang News] The masses of Beiping Wang responded to the call to actively fight against the drought. Village cadres led the masses to repair canals. Thirty people participated. In three days, they built a four-foot high, three-zhang long (approximately 10 meters) water dam in the south of the village, and a drainage ditch three li (approximately 1.5 kilometers) long, which can irrigate eighty mu (approximately 5.3 hectares) of land, turning eighty mu of dry land that had never been irrigated in history into paddy fields. In addition, the village is organizing the masses to prepare for further large-scale canal construction to turn more dry land into irrigated land. (Shuangqing)
    [Our Newspaper, Taiyue, 24th dispatch] Zhu Long River in Dongmatou Village, Jiyuan, was destroyed by the Japanese invaders. For several years, more than a thousand mu of fertile land along the river lost irrigation. In the spring, due to lack of rain, the emancipated farmers of the village, with the support of a government loan of 100,000 yuan, actively dredged and diverted water back into the old channel. The project has now been completed, and a thousand mu of fertile land has regained water conservancy.
