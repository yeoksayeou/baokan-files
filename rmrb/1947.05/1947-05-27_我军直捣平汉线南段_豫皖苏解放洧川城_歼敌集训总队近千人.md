　　[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] (Delayed) The Yu-Wan-Su People's Liberation Army continues to cross the New Yellow River, advancing towards the southern section of the Pinghan Railway. On the 8th of this month, a unit of the southward-advancing Liberation Army liberated Weichuan County, northeast of Xuchang. The Chiang troops guarding it were weak, and no resistance was encountered. The next day (9th), our army continued south and, in Weizhuang, Xiefang, Tuancun and other places between Weichuan and Yanling, annihilated the entire Second Regiment of the Chiang-controlled Henan Sixth Special District Training Corps, capturing the detachment leader Zhao Jiayan and 783 others, killing and wounding over 100, and seizing 642 long and short guns, over 10 light machine guns, 58 war horses, and a large quantity of ammunition. The battle results are still expanding.
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] All members of the Fifth Detachment of the Wuzhi County Workers' Team, combined with parts of the Fourth Detachment, the Jiaozuo Third Detachment, and the Public Security Team, ambushed the enemy at dawn on the 10th of this month in Beidi, near Fucheng, about five li from Jiaozuo, and west of Xinzhuang. When 28 members of the Wang Da-Liu unit, the Jiaozuo township puppet self-defense corps, happily entered the ambush circle, they were completely annihilated in five minutes of courageous action. Except for six or seven who escaped, all the enemy were wiped out. Seven enemies were captured, over 10 were killed, and 10 rifles and some ammunition were seized. The county command believes that this ambush was meticulously planned, and the action was resolute, courageous, and swift. The battle was resolved in five or six minutes, and the unit left immediately after the fighting. It is an example of the county's workers' teams automatically combining to annihilate the enemy and is hereby commended.
