　　Jin-Cha-Ji Zhengtai Front Field Army Thanks Taihang Military and Civilians for Supporting the Operations
　　[Our Dispatch] The commanders of a certain unit of the Jin-Cha-Ji People's Liberation Army Zhengtai Front Field Army, Yang Chengwu and other comrades, recently sent a letter to the headquarters of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu People's Liberation Army, thanking the Taihang Second Military Sub-district's Party, government, military, and civilians for their enthusiastic support and assistance during the unit's operations on the Zhengtai Front. After first stating the brilliant achievements on the Zhengtai Front, the letter then described, in admiring tones, the assistance the Second Military Sub-district's war support work gave to their operations. The letter said: "At the beginning of this campaign, due to the intense and high-level mobilization of the Second Military Sub-district's Party, government, military, and civilians, they provided extremely enthusiastic assistance and support in terms of manpower, materials, and various organizations. This enabled us to avoid and overcome many difficulties in large-scale troop operations in an unfamiliar mountainous area, and allowed the campaign to develop rapidly and smoothly. It also greatly encouraged the participating troops in spirit and politically, and greatly enhanced their combat confidence and sense of responsibility. In particular, the well-organized stretcher-bearer civilians vigorously transported ammunition and supplies to the front lines. Women and children's groups made dry rations in the rear and widely organized comfort stations to warmly comfort and care for the wounded along the way. The front and rear, the army and the people, the Party, government, military, and civilians, highly demonstrated that everything was for the victory of the front line, fully demonstrating the characteristics and great power of a people's war. This deeply moved all our commanders and fighters, who unanimously praised the excellent work in the People's Ever-Victorious Army area, and further recognized the reason why the People's Ever-Victorious Army in this area can win every battle. This is a great education for us. Now, the morale of the entire front is getting higher and higher, and everyone is striving to perform meritorious deeds and continue to fight great victories to repay the local Party, government, military, and civilians for their support and expectations." The letter concluded: "In this campaign, we have emphasized in all our work the importance of strictly observing political discipline, respecting local people's customs and habits, and loving the people, and we will make the greatest efforts to relieve the suffering of the people along the Zhengtai line under the ravages of the Yan puppet regime." (Liu)
　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, May 18th: 30,000 militiamen and masses from the Zhengtai Front, Taihang Xiyang, and Pind Ding area participated in the war. Within just two or three days, they sent one million jin of grain, oil, salt, firewood, and grass to the front lines, so the troops did not feel difficulties operating in the "no-man's land" created by Yan's puppet regime. During the battles, the participants displayed unparalleled courage. The North and South Gou militia of Xiyang County bravely assisted troops in scaling the city walls of Pind Ding in eight minutes on the night of the 17th. Liu Yezhu, a self-defense member of the county, rescued the wounded on the front line while attacking a bunker. Despite being wounded in the leg, he insisted on staying on the front line. After returning, he insisted on working and refused to rest. The 34 members of the Pind Ding First District militia work team guided the army and charged with the troops when attacking Fengtai, killing and wounding 21 enemies, capturing 6, and seizing 2 rifles and more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition. Militia combat hero Zhou Shenxin captured a squad of enemy sappers near the Luanliu Railway Station, seizing 9 rifles.
