　　Review of the Hebei South April Mass Movement
　　Ji'nan Branch
　　The April mass movement was more in-depth than that of March, and the intensity of the struggle of the liberated peasants against the landlords far exceeded any previous period. Due to the arrival of spring plowing and sowing, it also showed the characteristics of not missing the farming season and combining with production.

　　After the Party Committee issued the instruction of "Implement the review of emancipation, seize spring plowing, and do not miss the farming season," all localities paid attention to it. In Ganji Town and Shengfo Tang in Wei County and the first district of Jize, emancipation and production were implemented under unified leadership. Under the leadership of the Farmers' Association and mutual aid team leaders, during the day production was combined with the brewing of emancipation, and at night discussions were held on land distribution, grievances were aired, and meetings were held. In Xunhu Village, Julu, the distribution of fruits had not yielded results for a long time, and the masses were tired of it. After it was decided to brew during the day and discuss at night, the masses immediately became invigorated. Guantao, Yuanchao, Wucheng, Guangping, Pingxiang and other counties all put forward the idea of not missing the farming season and distributing land first during the fruit distribution, which was deeply supported by the masses. In the loans of Xiajin, Nangong, Jize, Feixiang, Zaoqiang and other counties, the targets were clarified and the use was concentrated, which solved the production difficulties of the newly liberated peasants.

　　In terms of completely eliminating feudalism, some areas began a pursuit in April, showing that the struggle between peasants and landlords was particularly fierce. Landlords not only feigned poverty, colluded with and bought off cadres, and organized fake farmers' associations to gain leadership (this was very common in the Gaotang area) in order to avoid struggle before the struggle, but also used conspiracies and tricks to resist the masses during the struggle. For example, during the struggle in Ganji Town, Wei County, the landlords used kinship to desperately disperse materials. In Dongqifang, Qiu County, the Ren surname landlords of the East and West factions colluded with village cadres and the masses to create sectarian disputes within the masses. These conspiracies of the landlords were crushed one by one after the leaders in various places carried out class ideological education for the village cadres and the masses, and the masses enlightened each other. With a spirit of getting to the bottom of things, a thorough liquidation was carried out against the landlords, and great achievements were made. For example, in Aixinzhuang, Ningnan, landlords' materials worth 20,000,000 yuan were seized. In some areas of Gaotang, cadres were bold and brave, went deep into the border areas of difficulty, discovered activists, and supported the masses to attack the landlords.

　　In Jize, which had completed land reform and shifted to production, it was discovered that the masses in "thorough" villages were still not completely emancipated, so it was proposed to combine production and implement the elimination of feudalism. At present, the masses in each village are using the "Four Comparisons" (comparing land, comparing houses, comparing food, comparing clothing) method to enthusiastically brew a review. Ningnan used the "Four Comparisons" and "Three Thorough Struggles" (thoroughly fighting the landlord's land, houses, and floating wealth) method. In the five villages of Dingcao, Dongwang, Dongxi Town, Aixinzhuang, and Xiaohekou, 131 landlords who had not been eliminated were identified. Ganji Town used the "Three Hearts" (pat the heart, ask the heart, compare the heart) movement to implement ideological education throughout the struggle process, so that the movement entered the pursuit and annihilation war against the landlords. Members conducted major ideological reviews to separate from the landlords ideologically.

　　In the movements in Jize and Ganji Town, attention was paid to mobilizing and educating the "backward" masses, which powerfully promoted the development of the movement. After separate enlightenment education and collective discussions, the consciousness of 35 "backward" poor masses in Fudong Village, the third district of Jize, was raised, and they automatically proposed the requirement of thorough emancipation.

　　In terms of leveling and supplementing, some counties have taken a step forward in April. In Shaliu Village, the first district of Longping, most of the land is sandy and alkaline, and the quality is very different. In the past, the fruit distribution was not truly reasonable; recently, this village has fully promoted democracy and adopted the method of comparing land with land. After discussion by each group, the results were distinguished by quality, and a large exchange was implemented according to yield. In Yu Huang Temple Shang, the fifth district of Wucheng, some military dependents and village cadres were assigned more land during the land distribution, and those related to the village cadres also benefited. Most of the masses were dissatisfied; this time, after group discussions, it was decided to implement "adjusting and taking uniformly". Those who were assigned more last time would be assigned less or not at all, and those who were assigned less would be supplemented. The director of the Farmers' Association in Loujia Village, the fourth district of Yuanchao, returned the over-distributed fruits, and after redistribution, the village eliminated extreme poverty. The Linqing County District Office returned 1,042 mu of leased land; the Eighth Sub-district Basic Regiment returned 750 mu of confiscated traitor land and distributed it to the peasants, solving the land problem of 19 poor villages, which was deeply supported by the masses. The characteristics of this month were also manifested in the unprecedented development of the mass movement in the new district. A large number of cadres were transferred from the Second Prefectural Committee, Qinghe, Gucheng and other counties to Gaotang and Pingyuan New District. The mass movement in the new district of the two counties was then rolled out. Gaotang broke the conspiracy of the landlords to organize fake farmers' associations, and more than 40 villages set off a widespread anti-traitor anger. The leadership clearly put forward "Dare to go deep, drill down, and resolutely support the masses." The District Party Committee and the Third Prefectural Committee recently organized emancipation teams to go to the newly recovered area of ​​Linzhang to help the masses emancipate themselves. It is estimated that the mass movement in the area will be launched fiercely.

　　冀南四月群运回顾
    冀南分社
    四月群运较三月更趋深入，翻身农民对地主斗争激烈的程度，远超过过去任何时期。由于春耕播种的来临，又表现出不误农时和生产结合的特点。
    在党委发出“贯彻翻身检查，抓紧春耕，不误农时”的指示后，各地都引起了注意。威县干集镇、圣佛堂及鸡泽一区，翻身与生产实行一元化领导，在农会长及互助小组长领导之下，白天生产结合翻身酝酿，晚上讨论分地、诉苦、开会。巨鹿寻虎村分果实好久没有结果，群众厌倦，后确定白天酝酿，晚上讨论，群众马上振奋。馆陶、元朝、武城、广平、平乡等县，分果实中都提出了不误农时，先分土地，深得群众拥护。夏津、南宫、鸡泽、肥乡、枣强等县的贷款中，明确了对象，集中使用，解除了新翻身农民的生产区难。
    彻底消灭封建方面。部分地区四月份开始追击战，表现了农民和地主的斗争特别激烈，地主不仅在斗争前为避免斗争而装穷，拉拢收买干部，组织假农会，掌握领导权（此点高唐地区很普遍），即斗争中也在阴谋诡计抵制群众。如威县干集镇斗争中，地主利用亲戚关系，拚命疏散物资。邱县东七方东西两派任姓地主互相拉拢村干与群众，制造群众内部宗派纠纷。地主这些阴谋，经各地领导对村干群众进行了阶级思想教育，群众互相启发，都被一一粉碎，并以追根到底的精神，向地主进行了彻底清算，获得很大成绩。如宁南艾辛庄清查出地主物资价值两万万元。高唐部分地区干部大胆勇敢，深入边沿困，发现积极分子，给群众撑腰向地主进攻。
    在完成土地改革转入生产的鸡泽，又发现“彻底”村群众仍没有翻透身，于是提出结合生产，贯彻消灭封建。现各村群众正用“四比”（比土地、比房、比吃、比穿）办法，热烈酝酿复查。宁南用“四比”“三斗透”（斗透地主的地、房、浮财）办法，丁曹、东汪、东西镇、艾辛庄、小河口五村，比出一百卅一个未被消灭的地主。干集镇用“三心”（拍拍心、问问心、比比心）运动，把思想教育贯彻到整个斗争过程，使运动进入对地主的追歼战。会员进行思想大检查，从思想上作到和地主分家。
    在鸡泽和干集镇的运动中，注意了发动教育“落后”群众，很有力的推动了运动的开展，经过分别启发教育，集体座谈，鸡泽三区浮东村三十五户“落后”的贫苦群众觉悟提高，自动提出翻透身的要求。
    填平补齐方面，四月份有几个县已前进了一步。隆平一区沙浏村土地多系沙碱，好坏悬殊，过去分果实没做到真正合理；最近这村充分发扬了民主，采用以地比地办法，经各组讨论，结果分别优劣，实行按产量大换平。武城五区玉皇庙上，分地时部分军属和村干分的土地多，与村干有关的也沾了些便宜，大部群众不满；这次经小组讨论，决议实行“调匀取齐”，上次多分的少分或不分，分的少要补齐。元朝四区娄家村农会主任退还多分果实，重新分配后，村里消灭了赤贫。临清县区机关租地退还一千零四十二亩；八分区基干团退出没收汉奸土地七百五十亩，分给农民，解决了十九个贫村的土地问题，深得群众拥护。这一月的特点也表现在新区群运空前开展，自二地委、清河、故城等县抽调大批干部，开赴高唐、平原新区，该两县新区群运随即推开。高唐打破地主组织假农会的阴谋，四十余村掀起普遍的反奸怒火，领导上明确提出“大胆深入，钻下去，坚决与群众撑腰”。区党委、三地委日前组织了翻身队开赴临漳新收复区，帮助群众翻身，估计该区的群运将猛烈展开。
