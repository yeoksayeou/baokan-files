　　【This Newspaper, Shexian News】 In response to the instructions to hurry up planting and rush planting, the Shexian County Government held a general meeting of all government cadres on the 21st of this month. Secretary Sun first gave a persuasive mobilization on how to prevent drought, prepare for famine, organize rush planting. Then everyone conducted production inspections and discussions in each group. Comrade Zhang Zhenhua of the Education Section said: "Our agency's production land hasn't been planted yet. Like our group, there is one mu of land in Gengle Village, and we still don't know where that plot is." The Construction Section proposed: "Our group has seven fen of paddy fields, growing scallions, and now the grass is taller than the scallions. The masses are really laughing at us." After a whole morning of inspection, they discovered several thoughts hindering active production: One is that the production leaders of each group are not actively leading everyone, leaving after eating every day and not asking about production matters; one is that the group members are not aware of production, thinking that since everyone is a group member, why should I go to production alone; one is that life and work are not normal, and besides emergency work hours, they are just chatting idly, arguing, etc. In response to these thoughts, they discussed future rectification methods for production: (1) Each group will both produce and review production on the land, check what needs to be replanted, and immediately start replanting, and what needs to be weeded, and immediately mobilize to weed. After inspection, the General Affairs Section weeded all the vegetable plots with the five people in the group in the afternoon. (2) Strengthen small group leadership. Now, after eating, we call for production, and the group members automatically go to the land without waiting for notification. (3) Adjust agricultural tools. The county government has very few agricultural tools. It is now decided that each group leader will automatically connect and adjust the agricultural tools after eating. In this way, three mu were rush-planted and two mu were weeded in two days, and three mu of potatoes are being planted, and plans are now being made to help the masses rush-plant.

　　涉县县府加强机关生产立即动手除草补种
    【本报涉县讯】响应赶快点种抢种的指示，涉县县府特在本月二十一号召开全体机关干部大会，由孙秘书首先进行了如何防旱备荒组织抢种的说服动员，接着大家即进行各组生产检查与讨论。教育科张振华同志说：“咱机关生产地还种不上哩，像俺这一组，更乐村有一亩地，直到现在还不知道地块在那里。”建设科提出：“俺那一组有七分水地，长着葱，现在草比葱还高，真叫群众笑话咱。”你一言他一语，经过一清早检查，发现有几种思想阻碍着不能积极生产：一种是各组生产组长不主动的去领导大家，每天吃罢饭就走了不问生产事；一种是组员们对生产不自觉，认为都是组员，为啥咱一个人去生产；一种是生活工作都不正常，每天除了紧急工作时间外，闲着都是扯闲话、抬话杠子等。针对这几种思想，又讨论了今后整顿生产办法：（一）各组到地一面生产，一面检讨生产，检查出啥地需要补种，即马上动手补种，啥地需要除草，即发动马上除草。总务科组经检查后，下午全组五个人把菜地草都除掉。（二）加强小组领导，现在吃罢饭就号召生产，组员们也不等通知就自动上了地。（三）农具调剂，县府农具很少，现在决定每个组长吃罢饭自动接头把农具调剂开。这样，两天内即抢种三亩，除草二亩，栽山药蛋三亩，现正计划帮助群众抢种。（志胜、华峰）
