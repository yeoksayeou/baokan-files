　　【Report from Jilu豫 [Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region] on the 26th】 30,000 dike repair workers from five counties in the southern Hebei region, namely Xin County, Yongzhi, Wuxun, Guan County, and Yuanchao, arrived at the Golden Dike on the 14th. The original plan was to start major construction on the 15th, but due to their high level of enthusiastic mutual assistance, work was started early on the 14th. Every day before dawn, the workers voluntarily went to work to rush the repairs, and the speed of the project was amazing. The project, which was originally planned to take half a month, was completed in seven or eight days. Xin County launched a meritorious service campaign during the dike repair, so the project was done well and quickly. The original project assigned to the county was only to build one dam, but in order to earn more merit, the second, third, and fourth districts built five dams. The original estimate was that one person would do two cubic meters of earthwork per day, but the fourth district averaged four cubic meters of earthwork per person per day. Zhao Xizhu and Zhao Rujun of the sixth team of the fourth district carried more than 130 pounds of soil 240 loads in one go from morning to noon, becoming outstanding heroes in the soil carrying team. Guan County proposed to build the dike like a copper wall and iron barrier to truly prevent the Yellow River water. They went to work before dawn. The work of more than 700 cubic meters of earthwork in the Wangdikou section was completed in just one day. A large pit southeast of Caodikou Village, 72 meters in circumference and 8 meters deep, was filled in just one hour under the personal leadership of Zhang Qiu, the district chief of the White Area. In order to further improve the dike work, the district brigades jointly organized observation teams to visit and inspect each other eastward along the dike. Those who did well in terms of size and form were praised, and those who did not do well were reviewed and improved. The Wuxun workers filled and transported soil to level the pits built by the enemy and puppets south of Zhang Qiu City. Although the project was particularly difficult, it was completed on the morning of the 20th due to the workers' highly active work and resolute overcoming of difficulties.

　　冀南三万群众
    助修黄河金堤
    【本报冀鲁豫二十六日电】冀南区莘县、永智、武训、冠县、元朝等五县三万修堤工人已于十四日到达金堤。各工程段原定十五日大动工，但由于他们高度热忱的友爱互助，特提早于十四日开工。每天天不明，工人便自动上工抢修，工程速度惊人，原计划半个月的工程，七、八天内即告完成。莘县于修堤中展开立功运动，因而工程做的好做的快。该县原分配的工程只做一个坝，但为了多立功，二、三、四区就做了五个坝，原计一人一天做二方土，而四区平均每人每天则做四方土。四区六中队赵西柱和赵如军，从早晨至午时，一百卅多斤的土担，一气挑了二百四十担，成了担土队的出色英雄。冠县提出要把堤打得像铜墙铁壁，真正防住黄水。天不明就上了工，王堤口一段七百余方土的工，只一天的工夫即做完了；曹堤口村东南一个大坑，周围七十二公尺，深八公尺，在张秋白区长亲自带领下，只一小时就填好了。该县为更加提高与改善堤工，各区大队特联合组织观摩队，沿堤向东参观与互相检查。凡尺寸形式等工作好的，互相表扬，不好的则互相检讨，设法改善。武训工人将张秋城南敌伪筑过工事的坑填平、运土，虽工程特别艰苦，但在工人高度积极工作坚决克服困难下，亦于二十日上午告成。
