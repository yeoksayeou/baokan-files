    [Our Jinnan Dispatch, 28th] In the past month, 20,000 young and middle-aged people in Jinnan have successively gone to the front lines to defend their land. In the first district, Wuxun, Linqing, Yongzhi; in the second district, Enxian, Xiajin; in the third district, Yongnian, Handan, Chengci; in the fourth district, Longping, Yaoshan, Nanhe, Baixiang, Renxian; in the fifth district, Jingxian, Fudong, Jixian, and other counties, more than 20,000 young people have gone to the counter-offensive front. As of April 18, more than 1,400 young people from Wuxun had joined the army, of whom 80 percent were emancipated poor farmers, and the rest were middle peasants. More than 1,300 young people from Linqing joined the army, exceeding the original mobilization plan by one time. In Qiu County, more than 500 young people enlisted in the army within ten days. Yongnian had more than 4,800 people, Longping had more than 1,600 people, and the other counties had about 1,000 people.

More than 100 young people from Xiliang Village in Yaoshan joined the army. Sixty-two young people from Xiaozhuang in Longping joined the army. Due to the general awakening of the peasants, a mass mobilization movement has formed. After Wang Jitang from Li Ci Village, Yongzhi mobilized his son, he mobilized his daughter-in-law and his wife, explaining that they could not live well unless they dug out the root of the disaster, Lao Jiang, and they finally agreed. In Handan, 16 cadres above the team leader level in Su Li joined the army or sent their sons to join the army. The director of the Yongnian Liu Gu Farmers' Association mobilized two sons to join the army together. In Zhao Zhuang, a martyr's family had two children who had already sacrificed, and they mobilized two nephews to join the army. The village chief of Shi Zhuang sent away two of his three children, and now he is mobilizing his third son to join the army. Li Xianglan, the leader of the women's association group in Xiyu Cao, Chengci, signed up for her husband. Shuang Lai, an old anti-Japanese family member in Chongxian Village, Yaoshan, led the four young people of his family to enlist in the army together.
