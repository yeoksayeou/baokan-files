　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: According to a France News Agency report from Flensburg: 20,000 workers and citizens here held a demonstration parade on the afternoon of the 13th to protest the worsening food crisis. Not only did workers leave their workplaces to participate in the demonstration that day, but shop assistants and civil servants also joined the march. The chairman of the Flensburg Trade Union Federation declared: Germans do not ask the British to support them, but they must at least be able to live by their own work. Note: Flensburg is in the British occupied zone of Germany.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: Moscow News: The Soviet "Labor News" commented on the strikes and demonstrations in the British occupied zone of Germany caused by the serious food situation. When the author, Isayev, investigated the cause of this crisis, he pointed out: The average harvest in western Germany in 1946 was almost the same as the pre-war harvest, enough to guarantee rations for every resident of the British occupied zone until the next harvest season. However, only a quarter of the grain produced in western Germany reached consumers. Landlords and rich peasants concealed a large amount of agricultural products and sold them on the black market at exorbitant prices, and the Junker families, who possessed huge amounts of wealth, manipulated and profited from it. The policy of sheltering landlords adopted by the occupying authorities is actively supported by all reactionary and Nazi elements in Germany, and a large number of Nazis occupy high positions in the food supply organs.

　　德境英军庇护大地主
    粮食危机加剧
    法林斯堡工人市民示威抗议
    【新华社陕北十六日电】据法新闻社法林斯堡讯：此间两万工人与市民于十三日下午举行游行示威，抗议粮食危机的加剧。是日不仅工人离开工作场所参加示威，而且店员与公务员也都参加了游行行列。法林斯堡职工联盟主席宣称：德国人不要求英国人赡养，但是他们至少必须获得依靠自己工作而生活的可能。按：法林斯堡在德国英占领区。
    【新华社陕北十六日电】莫斯科讯：苏联“劳动报”评论德国英占领区于由严重的粮食情势而引起的罢工示威运动。作者伊萨亚夫追究这种危机的原因时指出：一九四六年在西部德国的收获平均数，比战前的收获量差不多，足够保证直到下次收获季之前的英占区每一个居民的口粮。但是在西部德国出产的粮食，只有四分之一到了消费者的手里。地主与富农隐匿了大量农产品用骇人听闻的高价在黑市出卖，拥有巨量财富的容克家族们更从中操纵取巧。占领区当局所采取的庇护大地主政策，受着德国一切反动分子及纳粹分子的积极支持，大批纳粹分子在粮食供应机关盘踞高位。
