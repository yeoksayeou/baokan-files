Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th. In the marginal areas of liberated areas, various regions are combining labor and military affairs to seize the time for plowing and planting. In Fangshan County, Hebei-Chahar-Hebei District, militiamen are strengthening joint defense during spring plowing to protect the masses' safe production. In Xia Tanlin alone, 19 mutual aid groups and 16 textile groups were organized, with 12 spinning wheels added, resulting in extremely high production enthusiasm. The farmers have full confidence in continuing production in the future. In Xin County, west of the Datong-Puzhou Railway, more than 20 villages formed a unified command for combat and production, establishing a 30-mile-long landmine blockade line. In mid-April, Yan Xishan's troops attempted to disrupt spring plowing but 20 were captured alive. The masses in a village on the front line also successfully plowed 3,000 mu of land and sowed more than 200 mu within three days. In a village in Ding County, Hebei-Chahar-Hebei, only three miles from an enemy stronghold, young and middle-aged people protected the masses and livestock during the day, and at night, militiamen provided cover to return to the village for rush planting. The people of northern Jiangsu, deep behind enemy lines, disregarded the high-pressure tactics of Chiang Kai-shek's army, which strictly prohibited the planting of sorghum along transportation lines. Farmers on both sides of the Grand Canal and the Tongyu Highway are still rushing to plant at night under the cover of militiamen. Sanzao and other townships have completed planting 1,400 mu.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 16th. In the border areas of Haimen, Qidong, Rudong, and Dongtai counties in central Jiangsu, armed forces are protecting the planting of over 90,000 mu of spring fields. In Dingdong District, Rudong County, more than 200 young and middle-aged militiamen from a certain township organized seven field protection production teams, divided into production groups and armed groups. The production groups cultivated the land, and the armed groups provided security, ensuring the timely completion of spring plowing. The masses in Qidong Qixi planted sorghum directly in front of the enemy blockhouses. The masses in the central areas are even more actively assisting the border areas. Militiamen from Kuanzhen District in Rudong County advanced to the sides of the Juegang-Matang Highway to protect thousands of farmers returning home for spring plowing. In a certain township in Tangyang District, Dongtai County, more than 300 militiamen organized seven teams to work and cultivate on behalf of others, helping a certain township north of the Fan Gong Dyke to rush-plant more than 3,000 mu in five days.
