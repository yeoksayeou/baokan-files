　　【This newspaper, Ji'nan, 11th dispatch】The Gao Tang New District mass movement is vigorously developing. In the Fourth District, 38 out of 71 villages have established peasant associations, and 23 villages have joined the struggle. In the Seventh District, 15 villages have established peasant associations, with over 940 members, and seven villages have already joined the struggle. The characteristic of the movement is that once a base village initiates a struggle, nearby villages quickly join the wave of struggle. Because of the long-term rule of the local Chiang bandits, the masses were initially afraid that we would not take charge and make decisions for them. In addition, the landlords used intimidation and spread rumors, causing many ideological concerns among the masses. Therefore, the leadership proposed "boldly supporting the masses and leveraging administrative power." When the Yin Ji struggle began, activists were not bold enough, and the masses had concerns. The leadership promptly expressed its attitude to the masses. In the struggle, armed forces were used to coordinate with mass parades. The masses felt they had support, their courage increased, and their enthusiasm was extremely high. The experience of the movement is: 1. After the masses are organized and their ideological concerns are dispelled, their new demands must be met, and they must immediately transition to struggle. The masses see their own strength everywhere, and their courage will be even greater. 2. Because many masses are still starving, the spoils of struggle should be distributed to the masses in a timely and continuous manner to encourage the spirit of struggle and expand the organization.

　　高唐群众解除顾虑
    新区群运蓬勃开展
    【本报冀南十一日电】高唐新区群运蓬勃开展。四区七十一个村中已有三十八村建立了农会，二十三村卷入斗争。七区十五个村建立了农会，会员九百四十余人，七个村已卷入斗争。运动特点是基点村一斗，附近村接着卷入斗争浪潮，由于土著蒋匪长期统治，群众开始时怕我们不给作主，再加上地主的恐吓、造谣，思想上顾虑甚多。因此领导上便提出“大胆给群众撑腰，发挥行政力量”。尹集斗争开始时，积极分子不大胆，群众有顾虑，领导上及时向群众表明了态度，斗争中以武装力量配合群众游行，群众觉着有依靠，胆量大了，情绪极高。运动经验是：一、群众组织起来思想顾虑打破后，就要满足群众的新要求，马上转入斗争，群众处处看到自己的力量，胆量便会更大。二、因为不少群众还在挨饿，斗争后的浮财要及时不断的分给群众，以鼓舞斗争情绪扩大组织。
