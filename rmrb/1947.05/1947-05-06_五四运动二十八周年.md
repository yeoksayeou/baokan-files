　　Twenty-eight years have passed since the May Fourth Movement of 1919. It was both a political and a cultural movement. The Chinese working class, for the first time in history, consciously participated in leading this movement, making it very different from previous democratic movements and opening a new chapter in China's democratic movement, namely, the New Democratic Movement, which differed from the Old Democratic Movement. The New Democratic revolutionary movement initiated by the May Fourth Movement is now nearing completion. The strength of this revolutionary movement was so small, so naive, and so inexperienced at the time of the May Fourth Movement. However, the pioneers of the Chinese working class who participated in leading the May Fourth Movement, such as Comrade Li Dazhao and others, were convinced that their cause was correct, that the liberation of the Chinese people would surely be victorious, and that the Chinese people had the power to liberate themselves. They fought unarmed against imperialism and feudal forces, demonstrating unwavering confidence in victory and unparalleled noble integrity. This confidence and integrity have been maintained by the Chinese Communist Party, becoming one of the important factors in the victory of the New Democratic Revolution. The May Fourth Movement gave birth to the Chinese Communist Party. Among the democratic movements of more than a hundred years since the Opium War in 1840, only this party has been able to lead the people, unite all democratic parties, defeat imperialism and feudal forces, and victoriously build a new China that is independent, free, happy, unified, prosperous, and strong. It is a great happiness for the Chinese people to have such a political party. China's area and population are equal to those of Europe; Europe is advanced, and China is backward. In such a vast country with a large population and an underdeveloped economy, the people have been mobilized, and the New Democratic Revolution is approaching success. This is a major change in Chinese and Eastern history, not a minor matter. This is the era we are in, a great era.
　　The May Fourth Movement launched China's cultural revolution, overthrowing the deep-rooted feudal old culture of thousands of years and creating a new democratic culture. This task was also carried out under the leadership of the working class, not the bourgeoisie. Hu Shih, who participated in the bourgeois cultural movement in those years, has now degenerated into a lackey of American imperialism and dictator Chiang Kai-shek. The cultural movement of the Chinese people under the leadership of the working class, after Comrade Mao Zedong's speech at the Forum on Literature and Art in 1943 and the rectification movement, has made rapid progress in the past four years. This kind of Chinese people's literature and art is different from the past in both content and form. This is a new stage in the development of Chinese new culture. If the new cultural movement after the May Fourth Movement was still limited to revolutionary intellectuals in terms of content and form, and still had a very strong "foreign stereotyped writing" and "student style," keeping a distance from the masses of the people, especially the peasant masses who accounted for 80% of the country's population, then the new culture since the 1943 Forum on Literature and Art and the rectification movement has served the workers, peasants, and soldiers in both content and form, and belongs to the workers, peasants, and soldiers themselves. The May Fourth Movement was like a "foot-binding emancipation movement" in culture. From then on, except for reactionaries such as Wu Peifu, Chiang Kai-shek, and Dai Jitao who still advocated "reading the classics" and promoting feudal, comprador, and imperialist culture, the masses of the people have had no nostalgia for foreign slave culture and feudal culture. However, there is still a period between the transition from foot-binding emancipation to the dominance of natural feet; it also takes a period from cultural revolution to a truly popular culture that dominates cultural undertakings. Twenty-four years after the May Fourth Movement, namely, the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art in 1943, advocated natural feet in literature and art. This is the literature and art of the masses of the people that has absorbed the excellent traditions of Chinese and foreign literature and art and has completely broken away from the influence of imperialist and feudal literature and art. Compared with the "foreign stereotyped writing" and "student style" literature and art that had been bound and then released, it is incomparably superior in both content and form. This kind of literature and art can only mature when the New Democratic revolutionary movement has already possessed a broad mass base and many revolutionary intellectuals are determined to dedicate themselves to serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. The cultural revolution of the May Fourth Movement is the precursor to the maturity of the new democratic culture of the masses of the people. Our cultural army, our literary and art workers who are fighting for a new democratic China, should not be limited to the level of the May Fourth Movement when commemorating the May Fourth Movement, but should highly value the new literature and art since the 1943 Forum on Literature and Art, bravely advance along the broad road pointed out by Comrade Mao Zedong, consolidate and develop the existing achievements, and complete the cultural revolution that began with the May Fourth Movement. This new cultural undertaking is already and will be one of the indispensable and important undertakings in the work of winning the victory of the New China and completing the construction of the New China. It serves the current revolutionary war and the future revolutionary construction; without it, the victory of the revolutionary war and revolutionary construction is impossible. We still have powerful enemies and arduous battles ahead, so we very much need a broad and powerful revolutionary cultural undertaking to fight for the common goal of defeating the enemy and overcoming difficulties, and to fight for an independent, democratic, and peaceful New Democratic China.

### 五四运动二十八周年

　　五四运动二十八周年
    一九一九年的五四运动已经过去了二十八年，这是一个政治运动，又是一个文化运动。中国工人阶级在历史上第一次自觉的参加了这一个运动的领导，使得这次运动成为与以往许多次的民主运动大不相同的一次，开辟了中国民主运动的新的一章，这就是与旧民主主义运动不同的新民主主义运动。五四所创始的新民主主义革命运动，现在是快要完成了。这个革命运动的力量，在五四的当时曾是何等渺小，何等幼稚和没有经验，但是当时参加领导五四运动的中国工人阶级先驱，其代表人物如李大钊同志诸人，确信自己的事业是正确的，确信中国人民的解放一定会得到胜利，确信中国人民有力量足以解放自己，他们手无寸铁，向帝国主义与封建势力搏斗，表现出坚决的胜利信心和崇高无比的气节。这种信心和气节，一直被中国共产党保持着，成为新民主主义革命胜利的重要因素之一。五四运动产生了中国共产党，从一八四○年鸦片战争以来一百余年的民主运动中，只有这个党能够领导人民团结一切民主党派，打败帝国主义和封建势力，并胜利的建设起独立自由幸福统一富强的新中国。中国人民有了这样的政党，是中国人民的大幸福。中国的面积和人口都与欧洲相等；欧洲是先进的，中国是落后的；在这样一个土地广大、人口众多，而又是经济落后的国家，人民已经动员起来，新民主主义的革命接近于成功，这是中国历史与东方历史上的大变化，并不是一件小事，这就是我们所处的时代，这是一个伟大的时代。
    五四运动发起了中国的文化革命，打倒几千年来根深蒂固的封建旧文化，创造了民主主义的新文化，这个任务也不是在资产阶级领导之下，而是在工人阶级领导之下进行的。当年资产阶级文化运动的参加者胡适现在已经堕落为美国帝国主义及独裁者蒋介石的僮仆，而在工人阶级领导之下的中国人民的文化运动，经过一九四三年毛泽东同志在文艺座谈会上的演说及整风运动之后，四年以来，有了突飞猛进的发展。这种中国人民的文艺，在内容与形式上都与以往不同，这是中国新文化发展的新阶段。如果五四以后的新文化运动还在内容与形式上局限于以革命的知识分子为对象，还有很浓厚的“洋八股”“学生腔”，与人民大众特别是与占全国人口百分之八十的农民群众还保持着距离，那开一九四三年文艺座谈会与整风运动以来的新文化就在内容和形式上都是为工农兵服务的，是工农兵自己的了。五四运动在文化上犹如“放足运动”，从此以后，除了反动派如吴佩孚、蒋介石、戴季陶等还提倡“读经”，提倡封建的买办的和帝国主义的文化以外，人民大众对于洋奴文化、封建文化已经毫无留恋了。但是，放足过渡到天足占优势，中间还有一个时期；从文化革命到真正人民大众的文化，在文化事业中占优势，也需要一个时期。五四运动以后二十四年，即一九四三年的延安文艺座谈会，在文艺上提倡天足，这是吸收了中外文艺优良传统而又完全脱离帝国主义与封建文艺的影响的人民大众的文艺，这比那缠过足又放开的“洋八股”“学生腔”文艺，不论在内容和形式上，都是高明得不可比拟。这种文艺只有在新民主主义革命运动已经拥有广大人民群众，并且有许多革命的知识分子立志献身为工农兵人民大众服务的情形之下才会成熟。五四运动的文化革命，是人民大众的新民主主义新文化成熟的先导。我们的文化军队，我们的为新民主主义新中国而奋斗的文艺工作者，在纪念五四运动时，不应该局限于五四运动当时的水准，应该对于一九四三年文艺座谈会以来的新文艺作极高的估价，向着毛泽东同志所指示的宽广的道路勇敢前进，把已有的成绩巩固起来和发展起来，完成五四运动所开始的文化革命。这种新的文化事业在争取新中国胜利与完成新中国建设的工作中，已经是而且将要是不可缺少的重要事业之一。它为现在的革命战争与将来的革命建设而服务；没有它，革命战争与革命建设的胜利是不可能的。我们面前还有强大的敌人与艰苦的战斗，因此我们十分需要广大有力的革命文化事业，为战胜敌人克复困难之共同目标而奋斗，为独立、民主、和平的新民主主义中国而奋斗。
