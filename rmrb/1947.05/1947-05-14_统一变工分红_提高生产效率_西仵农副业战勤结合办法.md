　　Unified Variable Work Points and Dividends
    Improving Production Efficiency
    The West Wu's Method of Combining Agriculture, Sideline Occupations, War Support, and Conscription
    [This Dispatch from Li Cheng] West Wu is experimenting with a unified variable work points and dividends method combining agriculture, sideline occupations, war support, and conscription. This method involves unified scoring, unified variable work, unified income, and unified dividend allocation based on transportation by weight, agriculture by work done, and war participation, conscription, and sentry duty based on the strength of full labor and the proportion of task difficulty. Taking the Sun Ai-lian group as an example: The entire group has 129 mu of wheat land and 209 mu of autumn land, a total of 13 households, 12 male full laborers, one semi-laborer, 4 mules, and 3 donkeys. After precise calculation, three laborers and three sets of large carts are assigned to transportation, while the remaining labor and animal power are used for farming and performing war participation and conscription tasks. The work point recording method is as follows: Within the transportation cart group, in addition to managing food for people and grazing for livestock, each person earns 10 points per day, and each livestock earns 1 point for carrying 20 jin of cargo. In agriculture, each mu of land plowed earns 12 points for people and livestock, each mu of double harrowing earns 4 points for people and livestock, and each mu of planting including rolling earns 4 points for people and livestock. The distance of the base area is taken into account. General living standard labor earns 10 points. War participation earns 10 points, with 1 to 2 points awarded for good performance. Conscription earns 10 points for round trips within 60 li without overnight stay (conscription with overnight stay receives a subsidy of one meal of noodles), and sentry duty earns 8 points per night. Each work point is worth one jin of rice in wages. Those who contribute more work earn more points and receive more rice wages. Regarding the use of work tickets and dividend allocation: After deducting the equivalent rice for the wages of people and livestock engaged in transportation from the total profit of sideline occupation transportation, 10% of the remaining net profit is awarded to active producers, and the remaining 90% is distributed based on the total points earned by the entire group participating in agriculture, sideline occupations, war participation, conscription, and sentry duty. More labor points result in a larger dividend allocation, encouraging everyone's enthusiasm for production and labor. The most recent settlement showed that the net profit from transportation was 100,000 yuan, the wages of the transportation personnel and livestock amounted to 84,260 yuan, leaving a net profit of 15,740 yuan. After deducting 10% for bonuses, the total points for people and livestock were 3,640, with each point worth 4 yuan (each laborer with 10 points could receive 40 yuan). Since the implementation of this new method, everyone's production efficiency has been improved, and the difficulty of earning pocket money after participating in war support and conscription has been resolved.

　　统一变工分红
    提高生产效率
    西仵农副业战勤结合办法
    【本报黎城讯】西仵试用农、副战勤相结合统一变工分红办法。这一办法是运输按斤，农业按活，参战、支差、站岗按全劳力的强弱和任务的繁重比例，统一记分，统一变工，统一收入，统一批红。以劳英孙爱莲组作例说明：全组有麦地一百二十九亩，秋地二百零九亩，共十三户，男全劳力十二个，半劳力一个，骡四头，驴三头，经过精确计算，抽出三个劳力三套大车来搞运输，其余劳畜力种地与执行参战支差等任务。记工方法是：运输大车组内除管人吃与牲口吃草外，人每日作十分，牲口拉车每载重二十斤作一分。农业上，每耕一亩地人畜作十二分，双耙一亩，人畜作四分，种一亩地连砘人畜作四分。运动根据地的远近规定。作一般生活标准劳力十分。参战十分，表现好的要奖一分至二分。支差往返六十里不住夜者记十分（支差住夜者津贴一顿面）、站岗每夜八分。每一分工一斤米工资，多入工者，多记分，多得工资米。在工票使用与分红上：副业运输总盈利除去搞运输人畜按分应得等价米外，所余净红利按百分之十奖励生产积极分子，其余百分之九十按全组参加农业、副业、参战、支差、站岗总分数来分，劳动分多多批红，鼓舞了大家的生产劳动积极性。最近结算了一期账，运输净赚洋十万元，运输人畜工资应得八万四千二百六十元，净留一万五千七百四十元，除抽去百分之十奖金外，人畜总分为三千六百四十分，每分可批四元（每劳力以十分记可批四十元）。自实行此种新办法后，提高了大家生产效率，解决了参战支差走后怕赚不上零花钱的困难。
