　　The "Generation After Generation of Soldiers" Turns Over
    Cao Xin
    On May 6th, I met Cui Quande, who had been liberated from Cuijia Bridge. He excitedly said to me:
    "Wang Ziquan's soldiers are 'generation after generation of soldiers.' If the son is killed, the old man has to go and replace him. If the brother is killed, the older brother has to take his place. If the family is all dead, they'll grab someone from your relatives' house. Anyway, everyone from seventeen to forty-five years old is taken. That's why no one wants to get married if they're serving as a soldier for Wang Ziquan.
    "Last autumn, my brother, Cui Quan'an, was only seventeen when he was seized to be a soldier. His betrothed broke off the engagement. In the twelfth lunar month, my brother really couldn't bear the hardship of being a new recruit, so he deserted on the night of the fifteenth.
    "Wang Ziquan sent people to our Dasikong Village, brandishing their box cannons, demanding the person. They tied up my old man and beat him half to death. There was no other way. I had to give up my stonemason work and take my brother's name.
    "This spring, my old man came to see me. He cried the whole time, saying there were no hands at home, and they couldn't get enough to eat and drink. My wife was even talking about divorcing me. When he left, I saw him off. The officers found out and said I was thinking of deserting. They dragged me back and used a ruler more than three feet long and more than an inch thick to hit my palms one hundred and twenty or thirty times, beating my palms like fermented dough. They also fined me fifteen loads of wheat to spare my life.
    "On the 5th, you surrounded us, digging trenches all the time without firing a shot. I was really worried. Who knew you'd call all our relatives and families to the trenches to talk to us? I even heard my aunt's voice. My aunt shouted to me, 'Quan'er (my nickname), don't fire your gun! They treat us so well, they're here to save us. As long as we hand over our guns, we'll be fine.' I felt really bad when I heard that. I wanted to respond, but I didn't dare. There were officers watching behind us. I saw with my own eyes two soldiers who responded get shot by the officers. Several of us together felt more and more heartbroken, and could only cry secretly.
    "As it was getting dark, the Eighth Route Army began shelling. The officers pressed us to fire, but we didn't want to fight at all. We couldn't wait to jump out of the stockade walls.
    "The Eighth Route Army used firepower to break through. Seeing that it wasn't working, Wang Ziquan ran away with the officers.
    "As soon as the officers left, we discussed surrendering our guns. The first four soldiers of the Eighth Route Army rushed in, and all thirty of us handed over our guns. Later, I found out that more than two thousand of us had surrendered.
    "Now everything is fine. My wife won't divorce me, and we have turned over a new leaf!"

　　“辈辈兵”翻身
    曹欣
    五月六日，我会见了从崔家桥解放出来的崔全德，他激动地对我说：
    “王自全的兵是‘辈辈兵’，儿子打死了要当老的去替，兄弟打死了要当哥的去顶，家里死完了，就到你的亲戚家去抓，反正十七岁到四十五岁的都要，所以谁也不愿意给王自全当兵的成亲。
    “去年秋天，我兄弟崔全安才十七岁，就给抓去当了兵，订下的媳妇就退了亲，到腊月我兄弟实在吃不住当新兵的苦，就在十五日夜里开了小差，逃跑了。
    “王自全就派人到咱大司空村来，掂着盒子枪要人，把我老的绑走了，打得死去活来，没办法，我只有放下石匠活不作，去顶了兄弟的名字。
    “今年春天，我老的来看了我一趟，一直给我哭，说家里没人手，弄不上吃喝，我老婆又要给我离婚。他走的时候，我送了送他，当官的知道了说我想开小差，拖回来用三尺多长，一寸多厚的长戒尺，打了一百二三十下手心，把手掌打得像发了面的馍馍一样，还罚了十五担麦子才算求下了一条命。
    “五号，你们把咱包围了，一直挖交通壕也不打枪，我心里真发愁。谁知道你们把咱们的亲戚，家眷全叫到壕沟里来给咱们讲话来了。我听到也有我大娘的声音，我大娘对我嚷‘全儿（我的小名）你可不要打枪呀，人家队伍待咱可好哩，是来救咱们的，只要咱缴了枪，就没咱的事。’我听了心里实在难受，我想答理一声，又不敢，后面有当官的看着，我亲眼看到两个当兵的给答理了一声，就叫当官的枪嘣了。我们在一起的好几个人，越听越心酸，只有偷偷地哭。
    “天快黑了，八路军就向里撩炮，当官的压着咱们开火，咱们心里早就不想打了，恨不得一下子就跳出寨墙去。
    “八路军用火力掩护着冲开了，眼看不行了，王自全就带着当官的逃跑了。
    “当官的一走，咱们就商议着要缴枪，先头冲进来了四个八路军，咱们三十多个人全把枪缴给了他们。后来我才知道我们两千多人全缴枪了。
    “这一下子可好了，老婆也不会给咱离婚了，咱可辈辈翻身啦”。
