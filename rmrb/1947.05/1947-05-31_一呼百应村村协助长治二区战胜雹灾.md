Responding to the Call: Villages Unite to Help Changzhi Second District Overcome Hailstorm

[This Report from Changzhi] On the afternoon of May 18th, more than ten villages in the Second District, including Xinyi, Yuanjia Zhuang, and Beidong, suffered a hailstorm. The largest hailstones were the size of eggs, the average size was that of walnuts, and the smallest were the size of red dates. The hailstones fell over an inch thick, and most of the wheat was beaten bare. According to veteran farmers, only 20-30% will be harvested. The millet seedlings were buried in the soil and had not yet emerged, and the corn that was about to emerge was crushed under the soil. According to incomplete statistics, 2,083 mu of wheat, 4,150 mu of millet, 180 mu of hemp, and over 2,000 mu of corn were destroyed. Upon hearing the news, District Chief Ren immediately led four capable cadres and twelve students from the Fourth School to visit the disaster areas to offer condolences and immediately organized the masses to rush to replant. He summoned the masses for discussion. The village chief of Xinyi Village said, "We cannot be overwhelmed by the heavens. We must fight against it. It can strike, and we can plant." After mobilization, the masses were greatly encouraged to fight against the natural disaster. However, there were no seeds for replanting, and there was a lack of farm tools. The district cadres immediately appealed for support from outside, transferring seeds and lending farm tools from non-disaster areas. Cao Linshui, a turned-over hero from Nantianhe, ran back to his village from the district to borrow one shi of millet seeds for the Jiajia Zhuang masses. The cadres of Sudian helped borrow ten seed drills. The masses were mobilized to borrow seeds from their relatives and friends, overcoming the difficulties of farm tools and seeds. The masses were even more motivated and happily said, "Farmers all over the world are truly one family." They immediately organized all the full labor force, as well as all the women, children, and elderly men, to rush to replant early and late. Everyone, regardless of age, had something to do. Groups challenged each other in competitions. On the night of the 19th, over 150 women from Xinyi Village went to the fields. By the night of the 20th, Xinyi and Jiajia Zhuang villages alone had replanted 975 mu of millet, harrowed over 400 mu of cornfields, and replanted 20 mu of hemp in just one and a half days. The masses in each village plan to complete replanting in four days. (Fu Tian, Ren Bin, Er Xiong)

　　一呼百应村村协助长治二区战胜雹灾
    【本报长治讯】二区信义、原家庄、北董等十余村五月十八日下午遭受雹灾，冰雹最大者像鸡蛋，平常有核桃大，最小也有红枣大，下了一寸多厚，小麦大部打成光棍，据老农说才有二、三成收，谷苗被土埋没未出土，将要出土的玉茭压死在土下。据不完全统计，打毁小麦二千零八十三亩，谷四千一百五十亩，麻一百八十亩，玉茭二千多亩。任区长闻讯，立即带了四个有力干部及四中十二个同学分至灾区慰问，立即组织群众突击补种。召集群众讨论，信义村长说：“咱不能被天压倒，要向它作斗争，他能打，咱能种。”经动员，大大鼓舞了群众向天灾斗争的勇气。但抢种没籽，缺乏农具，区干部立即向外声援，在非灾区调剂种籽借给农具。南天河翻身英雄曹林水，从区跑回村给焦家庄群众借了一石谷种，苏店干部帮助借出十张耧，在动员群众向自己亲朋调剂种籽，克服了农具、种籽困难，群众劲头更大了，很高兴的说：“天下农民真是一家呀。”立即把全劳力组织起来，又把所有妇女、儿童、老汉全部组织起来，赶早搭黑突击补种，能干啥就干啥，不管老少都有事干，组与组又提出挑战竞赛，信义村十九日晚有一百五十多妇女下地，到二十日夜仅信义、焦家庄两村一天半即补种谷九百七十五亩，耙玉茭地四百多亩，补种麻二十亩。各村群众计划四天可以完成补种。（福田、任斌、二兄）
