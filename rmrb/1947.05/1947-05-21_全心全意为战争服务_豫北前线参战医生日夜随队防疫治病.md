Wholeheartedly Serving the War Effort
Frontline Doctors in Northern Henan Accompany Troops Day and Night, Preventing Epidemics and Treating Illnesses

[Report from the Northern Henan Front by our correspondent from the Taihang Branch] More than fifty county-level war participation doctors active on the Northern Henan front have been working tirelessly day and night since the start of the war, actively supporting the front lines. They accompany the militia regiments, stretcher teams, and transportation teams on tense marches, treating illnesses back and forth, fearing that increased sickness will affect the war effort. "Wholeheartedly serving the war effort" has become a unanimous action. When entering the battlefield, doctors in each team generally educate the members on first aid and hygiene and epidemic prevention. Wu'an, Shexian, Pingdeng and other counties also conduct health inspections in each team. After the doctors of the Pingshun Sixth Brigade held a meeting to study epidemic prevention, they gave each member of the brigade a dose of preventive medicine. Their slogan is "Prevent before sickness occurs" "Urgent illness, urgent doctor, treating illness like fighting a war." They take care of sick team members as if they were their own brothers, staying by their sides to feed them medicine and water, and only rest after the patients are sound asleep. Shen Zhizhong and Li Yongtai, doctors from the Second Detachment of Shexian County, have participated in the war three times in a row, and he always reports first each time he participates. Shen Zhizhong, who had been liberated and turned over a new leaf, heard that participating in the war was to eradicate old roots, so he took 10,000 yuan from his own home to buy medicines and brought them to the front. He has personally treated hundreds of patients with mild and severe illnesses. Li Yongtai also cured six patients with difficult cases. Their activities are mainly in the rear, but they also go wherever the stretchers go. Their footprints are all over the front line battlefield, and their skills have also greatly improved in collective diagnosis. After the launch of the "Love the People" campaign, there were more facts of doctors seeing patients for the masses in the new areas. The masses in the new areas of Northern Henan generally spread the word that "The new world has arrived, and the new doctors treat illnesses as soon as they see them, without asking for anything in return." What particularly moved and praised many villagers was that seeing a doctor was free. Guo Fasheng and Fu Wanchun, doctors from the Linxian Road Demolition Team, successively cured more than a dozen patients in Liuhe Village, Qixian County, providing medicine and care without taking a penny. When Shen Zhizhong and Li Yongtai saw patients in Qianliujiang and Wangyou villages in Anyang, many villagers from neighboring villages rode donkeys to the team. Zheng Shuchun's young daughter had a bone boil that had been difficult to cure for a long time. In the past, when she asked a doctor, the doctor insisted on one dan of rice, so the boil had not healed for a long time. After Dr. Shen cured her, she gratefully spread the word everywhere: "There are living immortals in the Eighth Route Army, and poor people can also see a doctor." Zhang Yaozhong, a doctor from the First Regiment of the Third Military Subdistrict of Taihang, cured a military family member in Boluo Village. The military family member immediately wrote to her husband, telling him to kill a few more stubborn heads at the front to repay the kindness of the Eighth Route Army doctor." (Cheng Guang)
