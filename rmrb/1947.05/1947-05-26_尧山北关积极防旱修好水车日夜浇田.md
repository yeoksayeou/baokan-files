　　Yaoshan Beiguan Actively Prevents Drought, Repairs Waterwheels, and Irrigates Fields Day and Night
　　[This Newspaper Reports] In Yaoshan Beiguan village, originally there were eighteen waterwheels, but nine were broken and unusable. The owners were unwilling to spend money to repair them due to financial difficulties and narrow-minded thinking. Manager Wang of the bank calculated the detailed costs for everyone, saying that if a little labor was spent to repair them, everyone could irrigate their land. “Collect three-tenths of the crop from the seedlings,” and everyone will have grain to eat. He said they should not neglect major matters because of fear of labor. He proposed that if everyone had financial difficulties, the government would provide loans to help. With his help, everyone's thinking was straightened out. Li Luoqin was the first to say: "I guarantee that my waterwheel will be repaired and installed on the well within five days." Nie Youzi, Nie Baogui, and Baozhen also proposed to guarantee processing and repair. Sure enough, they all repaired the waterwheels within five days. The eighteen waterwheels can irrigate more than fifty mu of land every day. The masses of the whole village are full of confidence in conquering nature, fighting drought, and striving not to leave an inch of land uncultivated. Those with livestock use livestock to pull the wheels, and those without livestock use manpower to pull them. Men, women, old, and young are all participating in this irrigation movement. The waterwheels are clanging day and night.

　　尧山北关积极防旱修好水车日夜浇田
    【本报讯】尧山北关全村原十八辆水车，九辆坏了不能用，车主因经济困难又加上狭隘的思想障碍，谁也不愿花钱修好。银行王经理给大家算了算细账，说费点小工修好了大家都能浇地，“按苗三分收”，收了都有粮食吃，怕费工不修，因小事而误大事。提出如果大家经济困难，政府贷款帮助。在他帮助下，打通了大家的思想。首有李洛勤说：“我的水车五天内保证修好按到井上。”聂有子、聂保桂、保祯也都提出保证加工修好，果然五日内都把水车修好了。十八辆水车每日可浇地五十余亩，全村群众对人力胜天、战胜灾荒，争取不荒一寸土的信心十足，有牲口的用牲口拉，无牲口的人力拉，男女老少都参加这一浇地运动。水车不分昼夜在当当的响着。
