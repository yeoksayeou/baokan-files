　　Lucheng Fifth District Prevents Complacency
　　Implements Spring Planting Grand Inspection
　　[Reported by this newspaper] The Fifth District of Lucheng convened a district-wide cadre meeting and, using Zhangzhuang Village, where they resided, as an experimental village, first conducted a grand inspection of spring planting. On the night of the 21st, Zhangzhuang Village cadres reported that only over 30 mu of fallow land and 60 mu of stubble land had not been sown. However, after a joint inspection the next morning by all district cadres and the heads of mutual aid teams in Zhangzhuang, it was immediately discovered that there were 208 mu of stubble land and 74 mu of fallow land, totaling 283 mu, that had not been sown. Based on the experience of this inspection, a district-wide grand inspection was launched. As of the 20th of this month, out of a total of 70,808 mu of autumn land in 20 villages, 10,901 mu had not been sown, including 2,006 mu of stubble land. The un-sown land accounted for 14.5% of the total autumn land. The reasons for so much land not being sown are: First, the organization of the crash sowing was not strong, and the allocation of labor and livestock was poor. Households with livestock were busy transporting goods outside after sowing, while households without livestock were anxious but helpless. Second, wages were not paid in a timely manner, and some were afraid that, as in the past, they would only receive wages next year for work done this year. Third, cooperative organizations did not provide sufficient leadership in production, merely issuing work vouchers and considering the matter closed. Insufficient attention was paid to how to allocate work vouchers, how to allocate labor and livestock, how to help households without livestock, and how to help newly turned-over peasants with production funds. Fourth, the overall mobilization was poor, with old men still sitting idle on the streets in places like Beishe. Fifth, village-wide plans were not comprehensive enough. Some teams only cared about their own groups, and some squads only cared about their own teams, failing to implement village-wide livestock labor exchange and mutual aid, unified planning, and unified allocation and adjustment of labor and livestock. Based on these reasons, the solutions discussed were: 1. Cadres should go to villages to conduct a widespread mass-based village-wide grand inspection to overcome the complacency of cadres and activists. 2. Publicize the importance of seizing the season and rushing to plant among the masses, recalling the painful lessons of not being able to plant during the drought in the spring of 1943. 3. Implement village-wide labor exchange and mutual aid, uniformly allocate labor and livestock, and mobilize men, women, old, and young to rush to seize the season and rush to plant. 4. Settle wages in a timely manner. If a turned-over household truly cannot afford to pay at the time, the cooperative should provide a temporary loan, but this must be discussed and approved by the masses to avoid the problem of those who intentionally refuse to pay when they have the means. 5. Increase praise and encouragement, making full use of mass blackboards and radio stations to commend models every day and conduct small summaries and inspections every day. Groups and groups, teams and teams, villages and villages should conduct mutual inspections and competitions, stipulating deadlines for the crash completion.

　　潞城五区防止自满
  　实行春耕大检查
    【本报讯】潞城五区召开全区干部会议，并以住在村张庄为实验村，首先进行春耕大检查。二十一号夜，张庄村干部汇报仅有三十余亩白地及六十亩茬地未下种，但经第二天早上全体区干部配合张庄各互助组组长进行检查，当即发现有茬地二百零八亩，白地七十四亩，共二百八十三亩没有下种，根据这次检查的经验，展开全区的大检查。至本月二十号止，共计二十个村秋地七万零八百零八亩，未下种的一万零九百零一亩，其中有茬地二千零六亩，未下种的占全部秋地百分之十四点五。还有这样多地没下种的原因是：第一、突击下种的组织性不强，劳力畜力调剂差，有牲口户种上了赶着牲口到外运输；没牲口的户干着急没办法。第二、工资不及时，有的恐怕和过去一样，今年做了工明年才能得上工资。第三、合作社组织领导生产不够，仅是发出工票就算完事。如何调剂工票，如何调剂劳、畜力，如何帮助没畜力户及如何帮助初翻身农民的生产资金，都注意不够。第四、全体动员差，如北舍还有老汉在街上闲坐着。第五、全村性的计划不周密，有的是各组顾各组，有的是各队顾各队，不是全村牲口大变工大互助，统一计划统一调动、调剂劳畜力。根据这些原因，讨论出解决办法是：１、各干部到村普遍的展开群众性的全村大检查，克服干部积极分子的自满思想。２、在群众中宣传抢垧抢种的重要，回想四三年春旱时没有种上的痛苦教训。３、全村大变工大互助，统一调剂劳畜力，男女老少一齐动员突击抢垧、抢种。４、及时清理工资，若翻身户确是当时出不起，由合作社暂借，但要经过群众评议，避免本来有而故意不拿的毛病。５、多表扬多鼓励，充分的运用大众黑板广播台，每天表扬模范，每天检查小总结一次；组与组、队与队、村与村互相检查竞赛，规定日期突击完成。
