　　Introducing the Merit Reporting Movement of Li Wenbo's Battalion
　　Battalion Commander Comrade Li Wenbo used to be a propagandist and instructor. He is not only a good military commander, but also a very good political worker, especially good at utilizing newspaper work. Therefore, the newspaper helped them to invigorate the troops, boost morale, enhance combat effectiveness and the desire to improve, improve the cultural level of the troops, and guide the work.
　　"Report Those Who Have Earned Merit Three Times"
　　Comrade Li Wenbo's first article in the newspaper was a short story of twenty-odd words, titled "Eighth Route Army People are Strong and Kind-hearted." Comrade Wang Shitang, who was praised, paid more attention to battlefield discipline from then on. At that time, many people envied him and said, "We haven't violated discipline, why can't we be reported?" After the battle of Shao'erzhai, the newspaper published his article "More than Fifty Wounded People" "Blood on the Sleeves." Later, in the battle of Tulou, many comrades reported their merits to him on the battlefield and asked to be reported. He collected the materials from the battle and wrote "The Third Battalion in the Battle of Wanglou." After these were published, many comrades said, "As long as it is reported, we are happy even if we don't get a reward." Therefore, the demand for reporting became a wave. Before the battle, everyone made plans, and most of them had the item "Strive to Report." Everyone was determined to strive to be a hero and strive to create achievements. He also decided in the merit committees of each company, according to everyone's request, "Report those who have earned merit three times." During the battle of Wanglou, his command post was at the edge of the village. At that time, one person went and said, I captured a prisoner, please publish it in the newspaper; another person sent a few guns and asked to be published in the newspaper. The courtyard was crowded with people asking to be reported.
　　The Backward Have Become Good
　　A groom in the battalion headquarters often violated discipline. After he changed, Comrade Li Wenbo wrote an article "The Transformation of Shi Ming San." After it was published, Shi Ming San said, "My progress is not enough, I have to continue to earn merit." "Clapper Talk Criticism of Zhang Huobao" was written by several comrades from the battalion headquarters' newspaper reading group in the middle of the night. After it was published, the battalion commander and instructor talked to this Zhang Huobao, who often violated discipline. Zhang Huobao said, "This time I was reported, it's not an honor, I will really report it once after I have earned merit." Indeed, Comrade Zhang immediately made a plan to earn merit. He earned merit in this Henan-North battle.
　　Publish Their Own Small Newspaper
　　Li Wenbo noticed the situation of crowding and asking to be reported during the Battle of Wanglou, "Even the fastest hand can't write about so many heroes!" So, he asked everyone to write. At first, he would revise them, but later he published them as they were. In less than two months, fourteen correspondents were developed, including soldiers, military and political cadres, and administrative staff. They went from not being able to write to being able to write, from writing poorly to writing well. "Clapper Talk Criticism of Zhang Huobao" written by the soldiers' correspondence group is proof of this.
　　With the increase in the number of correspondents, they started their own "Merit Broadcasting Newspaper" to cultivate and improve the soldiers' culture and to promote the work of the battalion in a timely manner. This small newspaper was led by cadres and edited by soldiers.
　　"Newspaper Listening Enthusiasts"
　　In order to be reported, some people often inquired and urged for newspapers, "Has the newspaper arrived? Are our articles in it?" Therefore, newspaper reading groups were established one after another. The Seventh Company established a "Newspaper Reading Committee" and also had a writing and interviewing group. Whenever the newspaper arrived, everyone scrambled for it, especially the people in the battalion headquarters often surrounded Battalion Commander Li and asked him to read the newspaper. Number callers, health chiefs, and correspondent Xiuling, etc., have all become famous "newspaper listening enthusiasts."
　　Communication and newspaper reading work has enlivened the work of Li Wenbo's battalion.

### 介绍李文波营的上报立功运动

　　介绍李文波营的上报立功运动
    营长李文波同志，过去曾当过宣传员、指导员，他不仅是个好的军事指挥员，而且也是个很好的政治工作者，特别是善于利用报纸工作。因此报纸帮他们活跃了部队，提高了士气，增强了战斗力和上进心，提高了部队文化程度，指导了工作。
    “立功三次者上报”
    李文波同志的稿子，第一次出现在报纸上的是二十几个字的小故事，题叫“八路军人强心好”，被表扬的王士堂同志，从此对战场纪律更注意了，当时有好多人羡慕的说：“咱也没有犯纪律为什么不能上报呀？”打邵耳寨报上登出他写的“五十几位负伤者”“袄袖上的血”，后来在土楼战斗中，好多同志在战场上向他报功，并要求上报，他把战斗中的材料收集在一块写了“王楼战斗中的第三营”。这些登出后，好多同志说：“只要上报，不给奖品也高兴”，因此，上报的要求成了浪潮，战斗前大家订计划，多数有“努力上报”这一条，大家决心争取当英雄，努力创造事迹。他又根据大家要求，在各连的立功委员会上决定“立功三次者上报。”打王楼的时候，他的指挥所在村边，当时这个人去，说我捉了俘虏给我登报；那个人送去了几枝枪要求登报。要求上报的人挤了满院子。
    落后的变好了
    营部一个马夫，好犯纪律，以后转变了，李文波同志便写了一篇《石明三的转变》，登出后，石明三说：“我的进步还不够，还得继续立功。”“快板批评张活宝”，是营部通讯读报小组的几个同志半夜写成的，登出后，营长和教导员便和这个好犯纪律的张活宝谈话，张活宝表示：“这一次上了报，不是光荣，立了功再真上一次报。”真的，张同志马上订了立功计划，这次豫北战役中，他立了功。
    自己出小报
    王楼战斗那种挤挤拥拥要求上报的情况，李文波同志发现“天快的手也写不了那么多的英雄呀！”于是，就叫大家动手写，起初，还改一改，后来就原封不动的发出去，不到两个月，发展了十四个通讯员，有战士，有军政干部，也有事务人员。他们由不会写到会写，由写不好到写好。战士通讯小组写的《快板批评张活宝》便是证明。
    通讯员增加多了，他们自己又办了个《播功报》以便培养和提高战士们的文化，并及时推动本营工作，这个小报是在干部领导由战士任编辑的。
    “听报迷”
    为了上报，有的经常打听和催讨报纸，“报来了吗？有我们的稿没有？”于是便纷纷成立读报小组，七连成立了“读报委员会”，并且还有写稿采访小组，每当报纸一来，大家就乱抢，特别是营部人常围起李营长叫读报，号目、卫生长、通讯员秀龄等，都成了有名的“听报迷”。
    通讯读报工作，使李文波营的工作有生气的开展起来。
