　　Troops on the Henan-North Hubei Front Squeeze Out Time to Sharpen Their Swords
　　[Our Newspaper Henan-North Hubei Front, 18th Dispatch] In the past two months, the People's Liberation Army under General Liu Bocheng has achieved remarkable results in combining courage and tactics. As a result, they often win more with less in blocking battles and greatly reduce casualties in offensive battles. For example, in the Junxian blocking battle, our army, with one battalion, repelled five attacks by two contingents of Chiang's troops totaling more than 2,000 men. Zhang Shuangkou, a machine gun squad leader, injured 28 Chiang soldiers with single shots from his machine gun. Soldier Li Zunzhi hit three enemies with three shots, and artilleryman Yao Ruhai repelled the charge of more than 200 Chiang soldiers with five shells. Due to the proper and solid construction of our army's fortifications, Chiang's troops only injured two of our soldiers with five shells, creating a brilliant example of one-to-fifty. In the Yulin blocking battle, Xu Jinwang, deputy company commander of the 6th Company of the × Unit, led 20 soldiers and held out against a regiment of Chiang's attacking troops for two days and three nights, repelling more than ten attacks by Chiang's troops, killing and wounding more than 30 Chiang soldiers, with no casualties on our side. In the Shitou Mountain battle, Meng Wenxuan, the second platoon leader of a certain unit of our army, repelled four attacks by more than 2,000 Chiang soldiers with 18 men, creating a record of zero-to-forty. In the Laotian'an battle north of Chuhe Bridge, a certain regiment of our "Xikang" unit, tasked with assault missions, built 4-foot-deep, 300-meter-long communication trenches and various fortifications in two hours, completing the attack mission with a casualty ratio of one-to-fifty.

    [Our Newspaper Henan-North Hubei Front, 16th Dispatch] Under the call for full preparation for the great counteroffensive, the Yi-character units on the front launched a surge in improving combat skills and strengthening military learning. A certain regiment proposed the slogan "Improving tactics is the greatest care for soldiers" at a cadre meeting on "opening minds and studying tactics." In strengthening military learning methods, they focused on the further integration of military and political work and mutual learning among cadres and soldiers at all levels, convened various "Zhuge Liang symposiums," classified research according to the specialties of various arms of service, and called for "democratic discussion in peacetime, execution of orders in wartime"; striving to summarize combat experience and assess casualties after each battle; and going to the battlefield to study various actions in combat after the battle was over. A certain regiment held an enlarged meeting of the regimental committee, where military and political cadres above the company level studied the tactical command of various levels in groups, reviewed past experience, and emphasized that commanders at all levels should use their brains more and not rely solely on personal courage, taking into account the situation of both the enemy and ourselves. It was also decided that the regimental headquarters would establish a special military research group.

    [Our Newspaper Henan-North Hubei Front, 17th Dispatch] After the Yi-character troops held a hero commendation and celebration meeting, various units successively formulated plans for sharpening their swords. The hero Wu Wenzhi's squad announced the improvement of shooting skills, the whole squad learned to repair machine guns, and mastered various combat actions. Chen Zhonglian, the squad leader of the Hero Squad of the Eighth Company, provided meticulous guidance and education to the soldiers when they practiced night actions. In the garrison of each squad of the Fourth Company of a certain unit, tripods were full of frames for shooting practice all day long. Hou Liangshan, a new soldier, learned to disassemble a machine gun in three days. The enthusiasm for learning well in the Eighth Company of a certain regiment was particularly high. Comrades who had earned a good record were determined to lead the masses to learn well, while comrades who had not earned a good record actively strove to learn well. Soldier Tang Xiancheng had not been very enthusiastic in the movement to record and learn well in the past. Seeing that many people had become heroes, he wrote an article on the bulletin board saying: "From now on, I will transform myself, improve my skills, work hard, learn my skills well, hand over more weapons, and capture more prisoners to make great contributions."

　　勇敢与战术技术结合得好
    我军战力提高伤亡大减   
    豫北前线部队挤出时间磨刀
    【本报豫北前线十八日电】最近两个月来，刘伯承将军所部人民解放军，在勇敢与技术结合方面，收到了显著成果。因而在阻击战中，经常以少胜多；在攻击战中，伤亡大大减少。比如在浚县阻击战中，我军以一个营，击退两路蒋军二千余人的五次进攻。机枪班长张双科，以机枪单发伤蒋军二十八名。战士李樽芝，三枪击中三个敌人，炮手姚如海五发炮弹打退二百余蒋军的冲锋。由于我军工事建筑的得当而坚固，蒋军五发炮弹只打伤我军战士两名，创造了一比五十的光辉战例。在榆林阻击战中，×部第六连副连长徐金旺，带领二十个战士与进攻的蒋军一个团坚持了二天三夜，击退蒋军十次以上的进攻，毙伤蒋军三十余人，我方无一伤亡。拾头山战斗中，我某部二排长孟文选，以十八人击退蒋军二千余人的四次进攻，创造了零比四十的战绩。在楚河桥以北的老田庵战斗中，我“西康”部某团担任突击任务，在两小时内筑成四尺深、三百米长的交通沟和各种工事，以一比五十的伤亡，完成了攻击任务。

    【本报豫北前线十六日电】在全力准备大反攻的号召下，前线毅字部各兵团展开提高战斗技术，加强军事学习的热潮。某团在“打开脑筋、钻研战术”的干部会上提出“提高战术就是对战士的最大爱护”的口号，在加强军事学习的方法上，着重军政工作进一步结合和各级干部战士互相学习，召开各种“诸葛亮座谈会”，按各种兵种的特长分类研究号召“平时民主讨论，战时执行命令”；作到每次战斗后总结战斗经验，评定伤亡；战斗完毕后，前往战场实地研究战斗中的各种动作。某团召开团委扩大会，连级以上军政干部分组研究各级的战术指挥，检讨过去的经验，强调各级指挥员应针对敌我双方情况，多用脑筋，不只凭个人勇敢。并决定团部专门成立军事研究组。   （乃一）
    【本报豫北前线十七日电】毅字部队举行贺功庆好大会后，各兵团纷纷定出磨刀计划。英雄吴文芝班宣布提高射击技术，全班学会修理机枪，熟练各种战斗动作。八连英雄班班长陈仲连，在战士们练习夜间动作时，他细心的指导与教育。某部四连每个班的驻院，都架满三角架，整日练习射击。新战士侯良山，三日内学会拆卸机枪。某团八连学好情绪尤高，记好的同志决心带领群众学好，没有记好的同志则积极学好。战士唐宪成过去在记好学好运动中情绪不高，他看到很多人都做了英雄，在门板报上写稿说：“今后我要转变了，要提高技术，埋头苦干；学好本事，多缴武器，多捉俘虏立大功。”
