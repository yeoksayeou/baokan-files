　　Xinxiang Plunged into Extreme Panic
    Citizens Eagerly Await Our Army
    [This newspaper's front-line report from the Ji-Lu-Yu Front, dated 29th] Front-line reporter Wu Xiang reports: According to merchants who recently returned to Daokou Town from Xinxiang, after two or more brigades of Chiang's troops in northern Henan were annihilated, Xinxiang was plunged into extreme panic. Trains heading south from Xinxiang were packed with Chiang's military dependents. People were even climbing on top of the carriages. Large numbers of Chiang's military dependents fleeing from counties such as Hua and Jun were still pouring into Xinxiang non-stop. Thousands of carts on the Ji (County) - Xin (xiang) highway were transporting Chiang's military officers' personal belongings day and night. Even the donkeys of the villagers grinding flour were seized to pull the carts. Chiang's troops are reinforcing the fortifications of the town, blocking the city gates. The theaters have all stopped performing. Chiang's army, Chiang's government, and Chiang's military police have established a so-called "Joint Inspection Office," increasing patrols and inspecting pedestrians, and enforcing a curfew before dark. They have become so panicked that they are suffering from nervous breakdowns. Even old beggars in their fifties and sixties are suspected of being "Eighth Route Army secret agents" and arrested. The general public, however, are privately telling each other about the annihilation of Chiang's troops with incomparable joy, because when the 49th Brigade was stationed in Xinxiang, they snatched door panels and searched wallets, causing the citizens a great deal of suffering. Prices in the city have soared once again, and Chiang's currency of 10,000 yuan per note has already appeared. The citizens are all quietly saying, "We can't live like this, the Eighth Route Army should come quickly!"

　　新乡陷入极度恐慌
    市民殷切盼望我军
    【本报冀鲁豫前线二十九日电】前线记者吴象报导：据最近由新乡返抵道口镇之商人称：豫北蒋军被歼两个多旅后，新乡即陷入极度恐慌中，由新乡南驶的火车挤满了蒋军眷属。车厢顶上都爬着人，大批自滑、浚等县逃出的蒋军眷属还在不停地向新乡涌进。汲（县）新（乡）公路上成千辆大车昼夜运输蒋军军官私人的物资。老乡正在磨面的毛驴都被抢去拉车了。蒋军正在加修城关的工事，堵塞城门。戏院均已停演。蒋军、蒋政府及蒋宪兵成立了所谓“联合稽查处”，加岗盘查行人，天不黑就戒严。他们已经恐慌到神经衰弱的程度。五六十岁的老乞丐也被疑作“八路暗探”而逮捕起来。一般市民却以无比的快慰私相传告蒋军被歼的情况，因为四十九旅驻新乡时，抢门板、搜腰包，把市民实在糟踏苦了。该城物价又一次飞涨，一万元一张的蒋币早已出现。市民们都悄悄的说：“没法活了，八路军赶快来吧！”
