【This Newspaper, Taiyue, 10th】 Over two hundred and thirty refugee households from Quwo, who were forced to relocate to Yicheng and Fushan counties due to the Jiang army's occupation of Quwo last August, have been returning to their hometowns one after another. Since moving to Fushan and Yicheng, they have been able to support themselves with the comfort and assistance of the local government and people. Everyone is rushing to make new clothes, and those who cannot finish in time are washing their clothes clean. They said, "Let's go back and compare to see who is doing better." To thank the local masses for their brotherly friendship, they held heart-to-heart talks between hosts and guests before leaving, checked the procedures for working together and interacting over the past eight months, and invited them to dinner. After the 20th, the vehicles of each household, large and small, have been rolling continuously on the Quwo-Yicheng road. Women and children are smiling and singing songs in the vehicles. Cui Haishen, the old village chief of Nanxi Village, said, "Following the Communist Party is truly a life in paradise. I am fifty-one years old. If it weren't for the help of the democratic government, I would have died long ago, and I wouldn't be able to return home."

　　曲翼难民欢欣还乡
    【本报太岳十日电】去年八月蒋军进占曲沃被迫转移到翼城、浮山两县的二百三十余户难民，已纷纷还乡。他们自移居浮山、翼城后，在当地政府与人民的安抚扶助下，生活均能自给自足，人人赶做新衣，赶不及的，也把衣服洗的干干净净，他们说：“回去比一比，看看谁好谁坏。”他们为答当地群众的兄弟友谊，行前并召开主客谈心会，检查八个月来共事来往手续，请吃饭。二十日以后，各家的大小车辆，便陆续不绝滚滚于曲翼道上，妇女小孩在车上喜眉眼笑唱着歌，南喜庄老村长崔海深说：“跟共产党走实在是天堂的生活，我五十一岁了，不是民主政府帮助，早就死了，还能回上家。”
