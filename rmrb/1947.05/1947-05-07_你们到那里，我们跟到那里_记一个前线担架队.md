You Go There, We Follow There
    —A Record of a Frontline Stretcher Team

　　"Chairman Mao liberated us, we must defend Chairman Mao, defend the good times." This is the action slogan of the emancipated masses participating in the war. In this Northern Front campaign, the inseparable flesh-and-blood relationship between the army and the people was demonstrated on the battlefield. Every stretcher bearer took great care of their benefactor—the People's Liberation Army. When going to the front line, they used the pocket money they carried to buy eggs for the wounded and sick soldiers, and offered them comfort. When the soldiers needed to urinate or defecate, everyone patiently and gently helped them. At night, fearing that the wounded and sick soldiers would be cold, they took off their coats to spread on them or cover them, and took off their cotton jackets as pillows. They had no complaints even when the jackets were stained with blood, and felt that it was a supreme honor.

　　When enemy planes came to harass, everyone entered air-raid shelters with the stretchers to hide. Many people, fearing that they would expose the target, took off their black cotton coats and covered the white quilts of the wounded soldiers.

　　Comrade Yuan and Comrade Zheng from the Brigade Headquarters brought letters of greetings and some eggs from the leaders and wounded and sick comrades to the stretcher team to express their gratitude. When the message was read to everyone, they all felt that the troops were being too polite. How could the troops be thanking the people? They repeatedly refused to accept the gifts. Comrades Yuan and Zheng left the eggs and departed. After discussing it, everyone cooked half of the eggs, leaving the other half to take to the front line for the wounded and sick soldiers to eat. It was very convenient to eat the cooked ones when hungry and drink the raw ones when thirsty.

　　Not long after, Comrades Yuan and Zheng brought two award banners with the words "Model Stretcher Team," twenty-three certificates of merit, and another batch of eggs to the stretcher team. First, on behalf of all the comrades in the brigade, they thanked all the stretcher team members and cadres for completing their tasks diligently in the cold, heat, wind, and rain. Then, they stated that the troops had other missions and had to temporarily say goodbye, and asked for everyone's opinions about the troops. Everyone said: "We have no opinions, we only ask that wherever you go, we will follow." Comrade Yuan gave many explanations, and they shook hands and said goodbye with reluctance. When they looked back at each other, they all wiped their tears with their hands.

### 你们到那里，我们跟到那里——记一个前线担架队

　　你们到那里，我们跟到那里
    ——记一个前线担架队
    商增亮
    “毛主席给咱翻了身，咱要保卫毛主席，保卫好时光。”这是翻身群众参战中的行动口号。此次北线战役，在战场上表现出军民不可分的血肉关系。每个担架队员都非常谨慎细心的关照着自己的恩人，——人民解放军。上前线时，他们将自己身上带的零花钱买成鸡蛋给伤病员吃，并进行慰问，大小便时每个人都是很耐心的轻轻的扶着，晚上怕伤病员冷，把袄脱下给铺上盖上，脱下小袄作枕头，染上了血也无怨言，并觉得这是无上的光荣。
    遇到飞机来扰时，大家与抬子一同进入防空壕隐蔽起来，很多人怕暴露目标，把身上所穿的黑大袄脱下盖在伤员的白被子上。
    旅部袁干事和郑干事带着首长及伤病员同志的慰问信和一部分鸡蛋到担架队里来慰问，把信念给大家听时，都感到部队有些太客气了，那有部队慰劳人民的？再三不留。袁干事和郑干事丢下鸡蛋走了、大家商量了一下，把鸡蛋煮了一半。丢下一半还带到前线给伤病员吃，饿了吃熟的，渴了喝生的，倒很方便。
    过了不久，袁干事和郑干事带了二面写着模范担架的奖旗，二十三个奖状及一批鸡蛋又到了担架队来，首先代表全旅同志向全体担架队、干部队员在冷热风雨中不辞劳苦的完成任务致谢后，提出部队另有任务，要暂时告别，并征求大家对部队的意见，大家说：“没什意见，只要求你们到那里我们也跟到那里去。”袁干事又进行了很多解释，在依依不舍的情况下握手告别了，当互相回头看望时，都用手擦着眼泪。
