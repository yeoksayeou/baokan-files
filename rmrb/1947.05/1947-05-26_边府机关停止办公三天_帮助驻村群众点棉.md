　　Border Government Agencies Stop Working for Three Days
　　Helping Villagers in Stationed Villages Plant Cotton
　　[This newspaper's dispatch] The entire staff of the Border Government, responding to Chairman Yang's call, has stopped working for three days to help the masses plant cotton. The entire staff was divided into eight groups to participate in eight mutual aid teams of the masses. Over the past three days, they have carried more than 5,570 loads of water with the masses and planted 54.6 mu of cotton. Under the high degree of awareness of serving the people, all the workers in the agency, from Secretary-General Sun, various Secretary Directors, and Section Chiefs to service personnel and keepers, competed with each other to participate actively and happily. Zhao, a Section Chief in his forties, led the sixth group to find the masses first every day before dawn. He, along with comrades Su Sanyin, Wu Xusheng, Zhang Xiangfa, and Zhao Yinfu, carried water continuously for three days without rest. Comrade Cao Jiang led the fifth group, setting an example and working so hard that his throat became hoarse. Ran Junchang, the communications squad leader, carried heavy loads and walked fast. The masses said, "That fat guy is doing a really good job!" Generally, the cotton fields are about one li away from the water source, and the farthest are about three li away, but the comrades of the guard team can bear the hot sun and sweat to carry water up the mountain. The cotton field of the eighth group is two li away from the well, but comrades Li Sande, Shi Bating, and others carried water twice as many times as the villagers. After the three days, 21 labor assistance models were praised and commended by everyone and were recommended to the Merit Committee for recognition. The masses, fearing that the comrades' contributions would be buried, even came to inquire about their names so that they could be praised on the radio in the evening.
　　[Another dispatch] Peace Hospital and other agencies directly under the Border Government have also begun to help the masses with planting. Doctors and nurses are participating, and the movement is gradually developing.

　　边府机关停止办公三天
  　帮助驻村群众点棉
    【本报讯】边府全体人员，响应杨主席号召，特停止办公三天，帮助群众点花。全体共分为八个小组，分别参加群众八个互助组。三天来，与群众共担水五千五百七十余担，种棉五十四亩六分。全机关工杂人员在为民立功之高度自觉下，上自孙秘书长、各秘书主任、处长，下至勤务员、饲养员等，无不争先恐后，积极愉快地参加。四十多岁的赵科长率领第六组每天起晌都是先找群众，与该组苏三银、武序盛、张香发、赵银福等同志一连担水三天不休息，曹江一同志领导第五组，以身作则自己累得喉咙都哑了。通讯班长冉均昌同志担的重走的快，群众都说：“那个胖子干的真红！”一般棉地离水均在一里左右，最远者达三里许，而警卫队同志都能顶着炎热的阳光流着汗担水上山。第八组棉地离井二里，而李三德、师白亭等同志都比老乡多担二次。三天结束后，受到大家称赞与表扬的助耕模范达二十一名，均被提向立功委员会准备立功。群众怕埋没同志们功劳，有的还专来问询名字，好在晚上广播表扬。
    【又讯】边府直属机关和平医院等，也已开始帮助群众点种。医生护士均参加，运动正在逐渐开展中。
