　　[Reported from Cixian by this newspaper] In Pengcheng, men, women, and children are mobilized to carry water and rush to plant cotton on more than 600 mu of land. Workers, peasants, merchants, men, women, old and young in the town voluntarily united to rush planting on land near the wells. They voluntarily discussed who would plant whose land, either working in return or sharing the cotton. Through total mobilization and overall mutual assistance, they rushed to water and plant 600 mu in three days. A women's mutual aid group in Hequan Village, consisting of six women and one man, planted four mu of land. If the land had not yet been cultivated, they used hoes to break the soil. They had a specific division of labor: those who could carry water carried water, and those who could hoe hoed and watered. It only took them two days of work to plant the four mu. (Service Labor)
　　[Reported by this newspaper] In Dongxiqiu Village, Gaoyi, in order to rush-plant cotton, the masses discussed and decided to organize a rush-planting effort using waterwheels, with full mutual assistance, regardless of whether it rained. The whole village was organized into three teams, and all except the elderly, weak, and sick participated in the rush-planting group. With this organization, they watered 90 mu of land and cultivated 30 mu of land in one day. Among them, the most enthusiastic was the women's group led by Li Yin'jie. Four people worked together to push a waterwheel, watering 2.5 mu of land in half a day. Children like Hou Zengxiang and ten others also watered five or six mu of land in one day. Now, a surge of rush-planting cotton with people pushing waterwheels and livestock plowing the land has formed in the two villages. (Gaoyi Small Newspaper)
　　[Reported by this newspaper] In Da Wa Qiu, Xiyang, during the meeting to mobilize early planting, the leadership discovered the masses' idea of "waiting for the solar term." The leaders then guided everyone to start a discussion. Wang Zhiyuan, a 63-year-old man, said: "It's not early at all. Look, the cherry blossoms have already faded. I remember in past years, planting started when the peach blossoms just began to bloom. This year, the drought is not good. If it's delayed any further, it won't come out."翟建元Zhai Jianyuan, a 77-year-old man, said: "Plant on the hillside during Grain Rain, and plant in the river bend during the Beginning of Summer. I always plant early, and the crops grow well." After the two old men spoke and calculated the village's entire assets, they sounded an alarm for the masses. The next day, seven groups started planting, and on the third day, fifteen groups started planting. Currently, 795 mu have been planted, guaranteeing completion in eleven days.
