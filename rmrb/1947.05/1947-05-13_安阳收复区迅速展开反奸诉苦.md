　　[Anyang News] In Shuangquan Village, Sixth District, immediately after the recovery of Shuiye, the masses were mobilized to reverse the verdicts of the past and to redress grievances, seeking revenge for wrongs and justice for grievances. Initially, the masses were hesitant. After we conducted current affairs education and individual interviews, Wang Heitian, an activist, connected with six households that had suffered reversals of previous judgments. Subsequently, small group discussions were held, and in just a few days, a vigorous struggle against traitors, despots, and reversals of previous judgments unfolded. On the morning of May 1st, despite a light rain and the presence of airplanes overhead, more than a thousand people from the Shuangquan Joint Defense maintained their fighting spirit, recounting their suffering over the past five months and launching a struggle against the puppet village head, Ma Gen. Since the enemy occupied Shuiye in September of last year, they appointed him as the puppet village head, arbitrarily oppressing the masses, requisitioning grain and conscripting soldiers for the enemy, and actively helping landlords reverse previous verdicts, especially being harsh on those who had turned over a new leaf and the families of soldiers. Run Sheng's mother, at the struggle meeting, became speechless with anger upon seeing Ma Gen. She said, "I am a widow raising a child. We have no means. Ma Gen wanted my child to join the 'Homecoming Corps'. I kowtowed to people, but it was useless. Mother and son cried ourselves half to death, but they still dragged my child away." As she spoke, she began to cry again. Li Delai said, "Ma Gen took away all the things distributed by the Farmers' Association. My family had nothing to eat or drink. One mu of land required twelve jin of 'flower gun money'. The amount of rice and flour taken was countless. The landlord reversed the distribution of two mu of land and took back one mu, and I had to give the landlord two dou of rice (large dou). There was nothing to eat at home, and my wife was driven to hang herself." Ma Gen also organized the Red Spear Society in the village, and anyone who missed roll call was fined 5,000 yuan. Wang Heitian, a militiaman, was slow by a step and was fined 10,000 yuan. Countless others were fined without reason. He provided over 10,000 jin of public grain returned to the masses by the democratic government to the enemy to consume. Ma Gen and other puppet personnel ate steamed buns worth over 200,000 yuan at Ma Shunze's house, without paying a single cent. The masses truly hated Ma Gen to the bone. After this liberation, Ma Gen was captured by our army and handed over to the masses for disposal. After hearing the masses' grievances, everyone unanimously demanded that he be shot. On the same day, at the meeting, the head of the judicial section responded to the demands of the masses and executed him on the spot. Currently, the masses are distributing the spoils of victory and preparing for new struggles.

　　安阳收复区迅速展开反奸诉苦
    【本报安阳讯】六区双全村，在收复水冶后即发动群众反倒算诉苦，有仇报仇，有冤报冤。刚开始群众不敢干，经我们进行了时事教育，个别访问，积极分子王黑田诉苦串通了六个被倒算户，随后即进行了小组酝酿，在短短的几天中即展开了轰轰烈烈的反奸霸反倒算斗争。五月一号的上午，天降着细雨，飞机在空中飞来飞去，双全联防千余群众仍鼓着斗争意志，在诉说着五个月来的痛苦，向伪保长马根展开了斗争。自去年九月敌占据水冶后，即委他为伪保长，任意压迫群众，替敌方征粮抽丁，积极的帮助地主倒算，特别是对翻身户及军属更加苛刻。润生他娘在斗争大会上，看见马根就气的说不出话来了，他说：“我守寡养大了一个孩子，家里没一点办法，马根叫我孩子去当‘还乡团’，我给人家叩头也不行。母子哭个半死也无用，就把我孩子拉走了。”说着又哭起来了。李得来说：“马根把农会分给的东西完全拿走，我家没吃没喝，一亩地还要十二斤花的枪款，米面出的没数，分了地主二亩地人家倒算了一亩，还给地主出了二斗米（大斗），家里没有啥吃，逼的老婆上了吊。”马根又在村上组织红枪会，点名一次不到即罚洋五千元。王黑田是个民兵，一步迟慢，即罚洋一万元，其他无故被罚者更难数计。民主政府退给群众的一万余斤公粮，他供给敌人吞食了，马根等伪人员在马顺则家光蒸馍吃了二十余万元，分文不给，群众对马根真是恨之入骨。这次解放后，马根被我军捉回，随即交给群众处理。经群众诉苦，大家一致要求枪毙，当天在大会上由司法科长答复了群众的要求，当场枪决。现群众正在分配果实及酝酿新的斗争。
