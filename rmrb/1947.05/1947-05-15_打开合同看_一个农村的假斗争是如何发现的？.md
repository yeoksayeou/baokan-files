　　Opening the Contract to See
　　How a Fake Struggle in a Rural Village Was Discovered?
　　District Chief Wu Aiwei
　　Li Baosuo's Suffering
　　Li Baosuo and his mother, over sixty years old, fled from Dongshan to Qin Jiahe in the seventh district of Lingchuan due to famine, a small village of thirty-three households. During the ignition movement in March of last year, he was given a pair of white cloth trousers after the struggle against Ping Yuanchang, with cadres from the main village of Yangzhai participating. However, less than three days after the cadres left, Li Tianbao, the village's peasant association chairman, asked him to return them. During the review and assessment movement in October of last year, he was given a small cotton jacket after the struggle, with cadres from the main village participating. He was very happy to wear his new clothes to visit his sister in Dongpo. His sister, who had just been emancipated, was also very happy to see him wearing the newly distributed clothes. However, late that night, when everything was quiet, Yuanchang and Tianbao took it back and scolded him: "Running around in it is really a problem!"
　　"Poor people seek out poor people for their troubles." A few days later, he went to Dongpo again. His sister was surprised to see him and asked:
　　"Brother! Where are those good clothes you were wearing?"
　　He sighed and said: "The cadres wanted them back! They said I was too emancipated!"
　　"What exactly have you been emancipated from?" she asked again.
　　"Nothing!" The old man's tears were about to fall.
　　His sister told her husband, Cao Qifu, about this sad affair.
　　Investigation Uncovered
　　In February, the county held a training class for active peasant emancipation cadres. Han Antu, the political director of Yangzhai, reported on the village's struggle against local bullies and complete emancipation. Coincidentally, Cao Qifu also came for training and thought: "It's time to talk about that sad affair." He opened his mouth unceremoniously:
　　"Your Yangzhai cadres are all talk. Why did Li Baosuo of Qin Jiahe have to return the fruits of the struggle twice, and still has no solution?"
　　Antu said: "I don't know about this. I'll investigate when I get back."
　　After completing his training, Antu understood that only by delving deep into the work could problems be discovered and the masses fully mobilized. On the way back, he thought: the work in Yangzhai has never been said to be worse than that village by the district. This time I lost face in the training class, so when I get back, I won't do anything else but first clarify the problem in Qin Jiahe. Back in the village, he first talked to the village chief Zhang Gouhai, and then called Li Tianbao to ask. Li got angry: "You can investigate. If the old peasants in our village haven't been emancipated and there is protection, execute me!" This made everyone half-believe and half-doubt. Later, the peasant association chairman and the militia committee director were called in to discuss. Everyone said: "We can't just listen to the cadres. If our cadres go, I'm afraid we won't be able to investigate anything." Finally, everyone came up with a way to arrange for the emancipated peasant Zhao Guixian to investigate. At dusk, Zhao Guixian returned to report: "Li Tianbao went back the day before yesterday and detained Baosuo, saying he had a relationship with Ping Yuanchang's wife." While everyone was discussing, Li Baosuo rushed in covered in sweat. Seeing all the cadres, he said: "Village chief! I dare not go to the village anymore, Tianbao detained me. I secretly escaped while it was dark. Lord Zao goes to heaven with a stick of incense, it won't work now. As long as you all make the decision for me, everything will be fine." The cadres asked him a few questions, and he explained the whole story of daytime struggles and nighttime returns, and Tianbao's protection.
　　Detaining Ping Yuanchang
　　On the evening of April 5th, the sky was overcast and moonless. The Qin Jiahe peasant association was holding a meeting. Wang Licheng, the militia committee director of Yangzhai, led the militia, came like "pouring boiling water on a rat", and dragged Ping Yuanchang and five other targets out of the meeting. When they were arrested, the militiamen wondered: "Why is the struggle target participating in the peasant association?" Someone said at the time: "He has reformed well." But after being brought to the main village and questioned, Ping Yuanchang, seeing that the situation was not right, admitted that Li Tianbao's peasant association had returned to him twenty-five silver dollars, more than fifty pieces of clothing, and other things.
　　Li Baosuo Raises His Head
　　The next day, the political director and the village chief led more than ten cadres and several militiamen to Qin Jia Ling. They first asked Li Tianbao, who stubbornly said: "If there are poor people in our village who have not been emancipated, and I protect a struggle target, then beat me to death." Village chief Zhang Gouhai ignored him and gathered more than forty members by beating a gong. The village chief said: "Have we all been emancipated? Have we received the fruits of our struggle?" Someone in the crowd replied: "The old peasants in our village have all been emancipated! The landlords and local bullies have all fallen!" Others echoed. It seemed that their tone was very uniform. At this time, only Li Baosuo was squatting aside with his head down, saying nothing. Then the political director said to everyone: "Okay, let's go to the struggle target's house to check. Don't dismiss the meeting, wait a moment." The militiamen pushed Ping Yuanchang home. Yuanchang's wife took out six covered grounds (quilts), six felts, more than 160 pieces of clothing, and twenty-five silver dollars from the cellar. Everyone carried the things to the meeting place. The cadres pointed to the things with a smile and asked: "The target is thorough, where did these things come from?" At this point, everyone who had been speaking lowered their heads, but Li Baosuo raised his head.
　　On the spot, they questioned the struggle target, and the result was an admission that they had been returned after daytime struggles and nighttime returns.
　　"Why did you return them?" the cadres and militiamen asked. Only then did everyone speak their minds: "During the Shanxi December coup, the death of my village cadres Yuan Sigou and Li Laisuo was caused by Ping Yuanchang's brothers leading the assault team to kill them. The cadre (referring to Li Tianbao) is of one mind with them, afraid, and dares not want them. Once it is wanted the whole family will be accused of banditry." Hearing the four words "whole family will be accused of banditry," the village chief couldn't help but feel shaken, feeling as if some kind of "contract" had been made here. But after asking for a long time, people just cried and didn't say anything.
　　Li Tianbao Confesses
　　Li Tianbao was dismissed from his post, and the political director talked to him.
　　"Tianbao! The old peasants have already confessed. You have a contract to protect the target" ... The political director solemnly and slowly explained: "Being a cadre is not afraid of making mistakes, but only of not correcting them! You are also from a poor background, and nothing will happen to you!" After an internal struggle and constant persuasion, Tianbao began to confess: "First, I have a relationship with Xiao Yuan (Yuanchang)'s wife, and I didn't want to let him be struggled against; second, he often sent me noodles and eggs. He told me that as long as I could guarantee that no one in his family would be harmed, the Central Army would protect me when they came. I also said: If the world changes, you can recommend me, and now I can recommend you. He then asked me: 'If you are willing, let's make a 'contract'. I said, 'Okay', so Li Zhaohai wrote it on a red paper. In the village, thirteen households, both rich and poor, gathered together, at night, in the temple, drew a cross, burned incense, and kowtowed..."
　　Opening the Contract to See
　　The cadres took out the contract and saw that among the thirteen households, there were four struggle targets, seven honest and poor peasants, and two middle peasants. As for what the contract said, to avoid trouble, it is copied below:
　　"The writers of this contract, (thirteen names), because both parties work in this village, no matter what other country occupies it, the contract states that no disputes are allowed. We swear to heaven that if anyone has bad intentions and starts any disputes, the whole family, big and small, will be destroyed. Afterwards, peace and tranquility, singing Yangko to fulfill vows. Fearing that words are unreliable, a contract is specially made as proof.
　　December 13th, Republic of China 34th year
　　Contract swearers to heaven (thirteen names crossed below)"

　　打开合同看
    一个农村的假斗争是如何发现的？
    区长武艾巍
    李保锁的苦
    李保锁和六十多岁的老娘，因为灾荒从东山逃难到陵川七区秦家河，一个三十三户的小村。去年三月点火运动，斗争平元昌，有主村杨寨的干部参加，分到白布裤子一条。但干部走后不到三天，这个村的农会主席李天保，就叫他给退回去了。去年十月盘荏运动，主村干部参加斗争，又给保锁分到小棉袄一件，他穿上新衣很高兴地去东坡看他的妹妹，刚翻身的妹妹见他穿上分来的新衣裳，也很高兴。可是当天晚上夜深人静时，又被元昌和天保要回去了，还骂了一句：“穿着跑来跑去真成问题！”
    “穷人有苦找穷人”，隔了几天，他又去东坡，妹妹见他很惊奇的问：
    “哥！你穿的那件好衣裳那啦？”
    他长出口气说：“干部要回去啦！说我翻身多！”
    “你到底翻了些啥？”她又问。
    “啥也没哪！”老汉的泪水快要流出眼眶。
    他妹妹就把这件伤心事，告诉了自己的丈夫曹起富。
    调查出来了
    二月里，县里开干部翻身积极分子训练班，杨寨政治主任韩安土汇报村上斗恶霸、翻透身的事。可巧，曹起富也来受训，心想：“那件伤心事，可该谈谈啦”。很不客气的开了口：
    “你杨寨的干部尽是卖嘴，为啥秦家河李保锁分得两次果实都退回啦，如今还没办法？”
    安土说：“这事我不了解，回去调查。”
    安土受毕训，懂得了只有深入工作，才能发现问题，充分发动起群众来。一路上想：杨寨的工作区上从来没说过比那个村坏，这回在训练班丢了人，回去别的不干，先得把秦家河的问题弄清。回村先找村长张狗孩谈，又叫来李天保问。李起了火：“你们可以调查，如果我们村老农民没翻了身，有包庇，把我枪决了！”这一来，倒把大家弄得半信半疑。后来把农会主席武委会主任都找来研究。大家说：“不能光听干部，咱干部去，恐怕一下也调查不出来。”最后大家想出一个办法，布置翻身农民赵贵先去调查。黄昏时，赵贵先回来报告：“李天保前天回去就把保锁扣起来，说他和平元昌媳妇有关系。”大家正在议论中，李保锁满头大汗闯进来，见干部都在，就说起来：“村长！我不敢到村啦，天保扣我。趁天黑我是偷偷逃出来，皂老爷上天一柱香，到这会不行啦，只要你都给我作主，就都不塌啦。”干部们问了一番，他才把白天斗黑夜退，天保包庇的事，从头至尾说了个明白。
    扣起平元昌
    四月五日晚上天阴无月，秦家河农会正开着会，杨寨武委会主任王里成带着民兵，来了个“开水泼老鼠”一下把正在参加会的平元昌等五个对象，从会场中拉出带了回来。捉的时候，民兵都奇怪的问：“为啥斗争对象参加农会？”当时便有人说：“他转变好了”。可是弄到主村一追问，平元昌见形势不对，就承认李天保的农会退给他现洋二十五块，衣裳五十多件，还有其他东西。
    李保锁抬头
    第二天政治主任和村长领着十多个干部和几个民兵来到秦家岭。先问李天保，他依然硬着头皮说：“如果我村有穷人没翻身，包庇一个斗争对象，就捶死我。”村长张狗孩不再理他，自己打锣召集开会，来了四十多个会员。村长说：“咱们大家翻身啦！没哪？得果实没有？”群众中有人就回答：“我村老农民都翻身啦！地主恶霸都垮啦！”另外也有些人帮腔，看来口气很齐，这时只有李保锁蹲在一旁低着头不吭气。于是政治主任就向大家说：“好，我们去斗争对象家检查一下，不散会，都等一下。”民兵推着平元昌回家，元昌的女人从地洞里把六条盖地（被子）六条毡子，一百六十多件衣裳，二十五块现洋拿出来。大家把东西搬到会场上，干部一面指着东西一面带笑的问：“对象彻底啦，这些东西从那来的？”这一来说话的人都低了头，李保锁却抬起头来了。
    当场追问斗争对象，结果承认了是：大家白天斗了黑夜退回的。
    “为啥要退？”干部民兵就问起来。大家这才七言八语说了真心话：“山西十二月政变时，我村干部原四狗，李来锁的死，就是平元昌家弟兄俩引的突击队杀死的，干部（指李天保）和人家又是一心，嫌怕，不敢要。一了要举家犯剿”。村长说听“举家犯剿”四个字，不由得思想震动了一下，觉得这里面好像是订过什么“合同”似的。但问了好久，人们只是哭没说出来。
    李天保坦白
    李天保撤职了，政治主任和他谈话。
    “天保！老农民已坦白啦，你订的有合同包庇对象”……政治主任十分严肃的又慢慢往下解释：“当干部不怕做错，只怕不改！你也是穷人出身，绝不会怎你！”经过一番内心斗争，和不断地说服，天保就开始坦白了：“一来我和小元（元昌）媳妇有关系，不想叫斗；二来人家又常给咱送面送鸡蛋。他告诉我，只要我保险能不伤他家一个命，中央军过来保障我。我也说：如果变了天你能保举我，现在我也能保举你。他就又问我：愿意的话，订个“合同”。我说：“可以”，就由李照孩弄一张红纸写了，在村上围拢了有穷有富一共十三户，黑夜，在庙上，划了十字，烧了香，磕了头……。”
    打开合同看
    干部们把合同拿出来一看，那十三户中有斗争对象四户，七户老实贫苦农民；两户中农，至于合同说些什么呢？说明麻烦，照抄如下：
    “立合同文字人，（十三个姓名）因双方在本村办公，无论其他国家占了，合同言明不许挑起事非，对天明誓，如有一人坏心，起甚事非，一家满门大小人口绝亡，以后，平和无事，唱秧歌还愿，恐口无凭，特立合同文字存证。
    民国三十四年十二月十三日
    立合同对天明誓人（十三人的姓名下划十字）”
