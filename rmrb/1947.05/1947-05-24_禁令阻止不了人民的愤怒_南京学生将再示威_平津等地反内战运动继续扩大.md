Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: TASS reports: According to Nanjing newspapers, students have publicly expressed surprise at Chiang Kai-shek's condemnation in his proclamation of their marches and demonstrations as "incited by the Communist Party." Students declared that regardless of any bans, they will continue to march and demonstrate. According to news from Beiping, representatives of the emergency meeting composed of students from eleven universities and colleges in North China issued an appeal, urging all students to participate in the June 2nd (i.e., Anti-Civil War Day) strike and demanding an immediate end to the Chinese civil war. Student leaders called on workers, merchants, and other sectors to participate in mass anti-civil war demonstrations. Xu Deheng, a professor at Peking University who recently arrived here from Beiping, said: "Student unrest stems from the following facts: students and faculty are currently on the verge of starvation, the root cause of which is the civil war. During the Anti-Japanese War, students were able to endure deprivation; however, the situation is different today with the civil war underway."

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 21st: A shocking massacre of students at a branch school of the Weixian Middle School occurred in Weicheng by Chiang's bandits. On March 31st, two soldiers from the Sixth Army's Engineering Battalion went to the wall of the Weixian Middle School branch (Wangliuzhen, southwest of Weicheng) to cut iron thorns to build civil war fortifications. They were dissuaded by about three hundred students. Shortly after the soldiers returned to their unit, about sixty soldiers in two rows from the unit surrounded the school and fired American-style submachine guns at the students who were in class. Several students, including Wang Yongnian and Li Guangyan, were killed or wounded. Yang Lianzhi, the director of education at the school, attempted to go out of the school to negotiate but was shot dead as soon as he left the school gate. A teacher named Zhang was also wounded at the same time. Afterwards, students, teachers, and citizens of Weicheng were extremely angry and were preparing to strike and protest, but they were suppressed by Kui Mi, the commander of Chiang's Sixth Army. Citizens said that Weicheng had become a Yama's palace.

　　禁令阻止不了人民的愤怒
    南京学生将再示威       
    平津等地反内战运动继续扩大
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】塔斯社讯：据南京报纸报导：学生界对蒋介石在其文告中谴责彼等之游行示威为“受共产党之鼓动”，公开表示惊异。学生界宣称：不管任何禁令他们将继续游行示威。据来自北平之消息，华北十一个大学和学院之学生所组成的非常会议之代表发出呼吁，敦促全体学生参加六月二日（按即反内战日）之罢课运动，要求立刻停止中国内战。学生界领袖号召工人、商人及其他各界参加反内战的群众示威游行。顷自北平抵此之北京大学教授许德珩谈：“学生之不安起于下列事实：学生及教职员现正濒于饥饿，其根本原因在于内战。抗战期间，学生尚能忍受剥夺；但是，今天内战正在进行，情形就不同了。”
    【新华社山东二十一日电】潍城发生蒋贼血洗县中分校学生惊人惨案。三月三十一日，蒋六军工兵营士兵二人，为修筑内战工事至潍县中学分校（潍城西南望流镇）围墙上割铁棘子，当遭三百余学生劝阻，乃该士兵归部后不久即有该部士兵两排约六十余人，将学校包围，以美式冲锋式机枪向正在上课之学生射击，当有学生王永年、李广言等数人伤亡。该校教务主任杨连致拟出校交涉，甫出校门即被击毙，教员张某亦于同时负伤。事后潍城各校学生教员及市民均气愤异常，正酝酿罢课罢教以示抗议，但又为蒋六军军长奎弥所镇压。市民们说潍城已变成了阎罗殿。
