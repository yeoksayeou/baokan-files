Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, May 28th: Our correspondent Liu Baiyu commented: The demise of the 71st Army caused a huge shock among the KMT troops in the Northeast because this operation did not take place in Harbin, which Chiang Kai-shek dreams of every day, or even north of Changchun, but south of Changchun, in the heartland they considered safe. Pan Yu-kun, commander of the New 1st Army, was still broadcasting in Changchun on the 17th, saying, "Good news will be heard soon"; on the 18th, he broadcast again, "The situation in Huaide has improved, and a strong reinforcement has arrived 20 li from Huaide"; he also said, "The Communists have suffered more than 10,000 casualties." Unfortunately, the facts are not so. According to the captured KMT army's "Sui Dai Order A No. 20," it stated: "Attack and advance, aiming to force the bandits to the north bank of the Liao River and annihilate them." Chen Mingren, commander of the 71st Army, also said before departure: he would "coexist and die with the army." The problem is that these loud and resounding words cannot help them win battles; the ending is just the opposite, not only was Huaide city lost and people killed, but the reinforcements, whose equipment was not weak, also abandoned their armor and fled, giving away their prized artillery pieces and mountains of ammunition as gifts, and they gave them away very happily and cleanly. The so-called "ten thousand corpses left behind" are none other than themselves. Hitler once hoped that the summer offensive would not be the Soviets', now Du Yuming's hope that the thawing of the Songhua River would not hinder our army has failed, and instead, our army appeared in southern Manchuria completely unhindered. It has been exactly one year since I participated in the Battle of Siping last year. This victory fully exposes that the KMT troops in the Northeast have been repeatedly annihilated, their strength is insufficient, and they have shifted from their frantic offensive to defense. It fully demonstrates that the strength of the people in the liberated areas has grown unprecedentedly in the past year, reaching the enemy's rear. The belligerent Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group must know that the downhill road is not easy to walk, and bragging is not a good thing. Those who are besieged are annihilated, and those who are trying to relieve the siege are also annihilated. The "good news" Pan Yu-kun mentioned can be summed up in one sentence: it is just a repeat of the old story of "losing both the wife and the army."

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, May 27th: Our correspondent Liu Boyu reported on the demise of the KMT 71st Army, saying: On May 18th and 19th, Lin Biao's army suddenly appeared southwest of Changchun and skillfully and quickly completed the annihilation of the KMT 71st Army. When the KMT troops in Huaide became turtles in a jar, Du Yuming hurriedly gathered the remnants of the 91st Division and the 88th Division, as well as the 30th Division of the New 1st Army, and gradually probed forward along the XinKai River from Gongzhuling, Changchun and other places. On the morning of the 17th, the 30th Division, with fierce artillery fire, harbored fearful feelings, but also fabricated the illusion of "annihilating the Communist army in the area east of Huaide," covering the above-mentioned KMT troops. After crossing the Liao River westward, when the 91st Regiment was hesitating and not moving forward, our army immediately maneuvered and transferred, letting the stupid enemy move north without restraint and fall into the bag. Once our army's deployment was complete, it immediately closed the mouth of the bag and launched attacks in several directions, and the sound of artillery shook the sky. In the evening, the red light of the KMT army's flares and signal flares colorfully filled the night sky. On the morning of the 18th, a green and boundless depression was filled with wisps of white smoke everywhere. At noon, the enemy desperately tried to break through, and a brave pursuit battle was quickly launched. The reconnaissance unit discovered the enemy's attempt to retreat across the entire line, and it only took ten minutes for our troops to be dispatched. The command's combat orders were conveyed in a "wind action mobilization" manner while walking and talking. The reporter followed the army under the bombing of Chiang's planes southward, from entering Yanjiadian to intercept the enemy to ending the battle at Daheilinzhi, along several major roads of the 30 to 40 li retreat and pursuit, the road was blocked by the KMT army's abandoned giant cannons, ammunition trucks, and jeeps. Wounded KMT soldiers and innocent dead were lying and standing horizontally. The nine towed howitzers that American imperialism gave to Chiang Kai-shek, and which had been approved by Chiang's Ministry of National Defense to be assigned to the KMT troops in the Northeast, were also lying intact on the roadside. The soldiers cleaning the battlefield couldn't help but burst out laughing, because they found that the enemy had stuffed heavy machine gun bullets into the barrels of light machine guns, and mountain gun shells were placed beside the bodies of field guns. Not far from the east bank of the Liao River, among the dominoes scattered by the retreating KMT army, there was also a charming picture of a young girl given to "Deputy Division Commander for Remembrance" and a diary full of obscene words. The soldiers who picked them up handed them to the reporter with great contempt and said very seriously: "It would be strange if Chiang Kai-shek doesn't collapse!" In this one-day-one-night long-distance pursuit and fierce battle, the 71st Army was destroyed. General Lin Biao's troops took advantage of the victory to recover Gongzhuling that night (the night of the 19th).

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, May 28th: The Northeast Democratic Allied Army captured a secret order from Du Yuming in the battle in which the 112th Regiment of the 38th Division of the New 1st Army was annihilated at Laoye Ridge in Jilin Province. The secret order was issued on May 15th, which fully exposed Du Yuming's fear of the Democratic Allied Army's summer offensive, and even threatened his subordinates with the death penalty to sell their lives for him. The secret order stated: "It has been found that the Communist bandits have launched a full-scale general offensive, invading Liaobei, Liaodong, Jilin and Changchun, Rehe and other places. The situation is serious. Our garrison troops should unite in hatred against the enemy, inspire morale, strengthen the offensive, and persist in independent and solid defense. If anyone withdraws from key areas without authorization or retreats in battle, the garrison officers of each garrison area shall be ordered to execute them on the spot according to the joint responsibility law, and they shall immediately order their subordinates to comply." Our correspondent commented: This murderous order of Du Yuming did nothing but scare his terrified subordinates. Due to the KMT and Du army's lack of troops, war-weariness among the soldiers, and low morale, the KMT troops guarding each line under the Northeast Democratic Allied Army's summer self-defense offensive have violated his "persist in independent and solid defense" order, and fleeing at the sight of the wind has become a sharp irony.

　　蒋军七十一军的覆灭证明蒋介石必然完蛋
  　新华社记者报导怀德之战
    【新华社东北前线二十八日电】本社特派记者刘白羽评称：七十一军的覆灭，引起了东北蒋军巨大的震动，因为这次作战不是在蒋介石天天所唾涎梦想的哈尔滨，甚至也不是在长春以北，而是在长春以南，在他们认为确保无虞的腹心之处。新一军军长潘裕昆十七日还在长春广播说：“不久可闻捷报”；十八日又广播：“怀德形势好转，强大援军已抵怀德二十里之处”；还说：“共军伤亡万余人”。可惜的是事实并非如此。据缴获蒋军“绥代命甲字第二零号命令”中说：“攻击前进，期将该匪压迫于辽河北岸地区而歼灭之”。七十一军军长陈明仁在出发前也说：他要“与军共存亡”。问题是这些声嘶力竭的好听字眼，并不能让他们打胜仗；结局恰好相反，不但怀德城亡人毁，就是这支装备并不弱的援军，也来个弃甲落荒而走，把他们认为致胜武器的榴弹炮和堆积如山的弹药，都送了礼，而且送得很痛快，很干净。所谓“遗尸盈万”的不是别人，正是他自己。希特勒曾经希望夏季攻势不是苏联的，现在杜聿明希望的松花江解冻不但未能阻扰我军，我军反而丝毫不受阻制的出现于南满。记者自参加去年四平战役以来，恰好一年，这个胜利充分暴露东北蒋军经无数次被歼，兵力不足，已由其疯狂进攻转为防御。它充分说明解放区人民这一年来，力量已空前壮大，打到敌人后方。好战的蒋介石反动集团，要知道下坡路不是好走的，牛皮不是好吹的，被围的被歼了，解围的也被歼了，潘裕昆所说的“捷报”，总结一句话，不过是又重演了“赔了夫人又折兵”的老故事而已。
    【新华社东北前线二十七日电】本社特派记者刘伯羽报导蒋军七十一军的覆灭称：五月十八、十九日，林彪蒋军的大军突然出现在长春的西南方，奇巧迅捷地完成了对蒋军七十一军的歼灭战。当怀德蒋军成为瓮中之鳖时，杜聿明慌忙纠集九十一师与八十八师残部及新一军三十师，从公主岭、长春等地，分路向新开河一线逐步试探前进。十七日晨，三十师以猛烈炮火，怀着畏怯心情，但又虚构着“在怀德以东地区消灭共军”的幻梦，掩护上述蒋军。渡辽河西进后，九十一团方正踌躇不前，我军立时机动转移，让愚笨的敌人放手北进，堕入袋中。我军部署既定，立刻封闭袋口，分路进击，炮声震撼天地。入晚，蒋军照明弹、信号弹的红光，彩色缤纷地布满夜空。十八日既明，一片油绿无垠的洼地，处处冒着如缕的白烟。正午敌人拚死突围，勇猛的追歼战从此急迅展开。相距侦察部队发现敌人全线退却企图，至我军各部队出动，为时仅十分钟。指挥部的作战命令，采用了边走边谈的“风行动员”方式传达。记者随军冒蒋机轰炸南下，从进入阎家店截击敌人到大黑林子结束战斗，沿三、四十里的溃窜与追击的数条大路，途中蒋军遗弃巨炮、弹药卡车、吉普，道为之塞。蒋军伤员与无辜死者，竖卧横陈。美帝国主义授给蒋介石，又将经蒋记国防部批准配属东北蒋军的九门牵引榴弹炮，也完好无损地躺在道旁。打扫战场的战士，都不禁失声大笑，原来他们发现了敌人把重机枪弹塞在轻机枪膛里，山炮炮弹被搁置在野炮的身旁。在距离他们并不算远的辽河东畔，却在溃退蒋军丢散的骨牌子中间，还睡着一张一位妙龄女郎送给“副师长存念”的嫣然媚像，和一本充满淫秽话句的日记。拾得它们的战士，很鄙视的将它们递到记者手里，并且很正经的说：“蒋介石不完蛋才怪啦！”就在这一日一夜长距离追歼激战的情况下，七十一军覆灭了。林彪将军部队当晚（十九日晚）乘胜收复公主岭。
    【新华社东北前线二十八日电】东北民主联军在吉林方面之老爷岭歼灭新一军三十八师一一二团战斗中，缴获杜聿明之密令一件。该密令系五月十五日发出，其中充分暴露杜聿明对民主联军夏季攻势之惊惧，乃至以死刑威胁其部下为他卖命。密令中称：“查共匪发动全面总攻，进犯辽北、辽东、吉长、热河各地，情况严重。我守备部队，应同仇敌忾，激励士气，加强攻势，持久独立固守。如有擅自撤防要地或临阵退缩者，一律授令各守备区守备官，按连坐法就地处决，仰即饬属一体遵照。”本社记者评称：杜聿明这一道杀气腾腾的催命符，除了吓吓其胆颤心惊之部下外，丝毫没有发生其它作用。由于蒋杜军兵力不足，军心厌战，士气低落，连日在东北民主联军夏季自卫攻势下，各线据守之蒋军背逆着他的“持久独立固守”命令，望风潜逃成为一个尖刻的讽刺。
