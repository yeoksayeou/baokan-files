Jiyuan's "Second Du Balian"
Gu Weijin

(1) Resolutely Execute Orders and Persist in the Struggle on the Spot

Last October, the enemy occupied Jiyuan City. A small plain in the eastern part of Jiyuan's Third District was ravaged by enemies from three counties. There were × militiamen in Qinshi Village. They had to persist in guerrilla warfare in this harsh grid area. What was in front of the militiamen at that time was a desolate village, surrounded by enemy gunfire. The village was full of rumors spread by secret agents and secret shootings. The worst thing was that the terrain of Qinshi Village was bad, with no obstacles on all sides, and the enemy could attack from all directions. The militiamen had to move to Quzhong Village (two li away from Qinshi). But this village was a den of bandits and secret agents. They fired shots and probed near the militiamen every night. The militiamen had to leave the village and move to the area between the Linlin River and the Guangji River. This was a long stretch of wasteland, and the environment was very harsh. However, under the leadership of Comrade Liu Chuanfang, the militiamen were determined to persist on the spot. Everyone discussed: "It will be terrible when the 'counter-reckoning team' comes back. We can only seek survival in death. With this gun in hand, we must fight to the end!" Thus, this short guerrilla team, like a young horse, galloped in the grid.

(2) Defeat the Puppet Regime and Establish a Guerrilla Base

In order to have a slightly safe place to settle down, the guerrilla team had to eliminate the nearest enemy. The target was those bad guys in Quzhong Village who fired shots and probed. On January 5th, the militiamen learned that more than 20 of them were going to the countryside to retain the enemy while beating gongs and drums. The guerrilla team ambushed them in the wasteland between the Linlin River and the Guangji River, and captured all the 20-odd secret agents. After the masses voted, it was decided to temporarily send them to the base area on the other side of the Qin River, and confiscate the property of the chief culprit, He Sifu's family, and distribute it to the poor. After the poor got the things, they organized self-defense teams to help the guerrilla team stand guard. From then on, the guerrilla team had a small guerrilla base in Quzhong Village.

Later, Jia Zhitong of Qinshi Village led the "counter-reckoning" in the village and killed five or six ordinary people. The guerrilla team got the information and ran to Huaifeng Village (Meng County), fifty li away, in a dark night, and brought Jia Zhitong back and handed him over to the masses for disposal. The masses all said: "No need to interrogate, no need for confessions, just get rid of him." This was very satisfying to the people.

(3) Rely on the Masses to Repel the Enemy

After repelling the "puppet regime" and killing the captain of the "counter-reckoning," the guerrilla team became the backer of the masses and even more of a thorn in the enemy's side. The enemy, like a hungry wolf, was always trying to devour the guerrilla team. At this time, the guerrilla team must have a sound intelligence organization. Xin, an old lady from Qinshi, and Wang, an old lady, whose sons were both in the guerrilla team, volunteered to take on this task when they heard that the guerrilla team wanted to gather intelligence. In order to connect with more people, they went to Qinshi and Quzhong to mobilize old women and men, saying: "The guerrilla team is doing things for us, we can't be ungrateful, we can't let the traitors harm the guerrilla team, let's help gather intelligence!" The old people all nodded in praise and said: "Heaven is above, the guerrilla team are our own people, how can we not care." Thus, more than a dozen old women and men formed a secret intelligence group, and they were active in the enemy's strongholds every day. With so many eyes and ears, the guerrilla team knew clearly every move of the enemy, even what they ate. Relying on the quick intelligence, they once drove away fifty-odd harassing enemies in Nanguanzhuang; and made a big disturbance in Baixiang Town, drove away the enemy in Gao Village, and beat the enemy far away from them.

After the guerrilla team took root, the enemy in Nanguanzhuang, three or five li around, retreated, the enemy's blockhouse in Gao Village was blown up by the militiamen, and the enemy in Baixiang was isolated, and soon retreated quietly. Thus, the militiamen had a large area of twenty-five li without enemies.

When the Third District summarized the work of this period, it pointed out that because this magical guerrilla team ran rampant in the enemy's grid, it opened up the situation: (1) It enabled the masses in 90 villages around Qinshi to live in peace, and at the same time, the masses in the Fourth District of Qinyang also had a base to transfer to. (2) More than 20 villages nearby, such as Quzhong and Shagou, automatically sought joint defense with Qinshi Village, and more than 10 villages in Gaocun and Baixiang in the Fourth District of Qinyang also wanted to seek joint defense with Qinshi because they believed that the Qinshi guerrilla team was very effective. (3) The guerrilla team has grown from a dozen people to more than a hundred people, becoming a very powerful fighting force. The Qinyang Independent Battalion also sought the cooperation of the Qinshi guerrilla team in combat. In late December, land reform began in this area. Thus, led by the Qinshi guerrilla team, the militiamen went deep into Qin and Meng counties to cover the masses in carrying out the struggle to divide the land. People called the Qinshi militiamen the "Second Du Balian" of Jiyuan.

　　济源“第二杜八联”
    古维进
    （一）坚决执行命令就地坚持斗争
    去年十月，敌占济源城，济源三区东部一块小平原便受到三县敌人的残踏，沁市村有×个民兵，他们要在这个恶劣的格子网里坚持游击战争，当时摆在民兵面前的是一片荒凉的村落，四面是敌人的枪声，村里是特务造谣与打黑枪。而最糟糕的是沁市村的地形不好，四无阻挡，敌可四面袭击，民兵只得转移在曲冢村（距沁市二里），但这个村又是土匪特务窠，他们每夜在民兵附近打枪摸哨，民兵们不得不离开村庄，移住林林河与广济河之间。这里是一片漫长的荒草地，环境很恶劣。但在刘传芳同志领导下的民兵，决心就地坚持，大家议论着：“土匪倒算队一回来就糟糕，咱们只有死里求生，每人有这一杆枪，一定打到底！”于是这支短小的游击队，象一匹年轻的骏马，驰骋在格子网中。
    （二）打垮维持建立游击根据地
    为了有一个稍可安身的地方，游击队必须消灭最近的敌人，对象为曲冢村那些打枪摸哨的坏蛋。一月五日，民兵打听到他们二十多人敲着锣鼓去农村挽留敌人，游击队便埋伏在林林河与广济河的荒草间，把二十多个特务全部擒来，经群众表决，决定暂时送到沁河那边的根据地去，并把主犯何思福家中的财产没收，分给穷人。穷人得了东西，组织自卫队，帮助游击队放哨，从此游击队有了曲冢村这一块小小的游击根据地。
    以后，沁市村贾志同在村里领导倒算，还杀了五、六个老百姓，游击队得息，便在一个黑夜跑到五十里以外的怀奉村（孟县），把贾志同抓回来，交给群众处理。群众都说：“不必审问，不要口供，干脆收拾了就是。”这一下，大快人心。
    （三）依靠群众打退敌人
    打退“维持”，打死倒算队长，游击队成了群众的靠山，也更成了敌人的眼中钉，敌人像饿狼一样，时刻想把游击队吃掉，这时游击队必须有健全的情报组织。沁市辛老太太与王老太太的儿子，都在游击队，听到游击队要搞情报，她们自报奋勇要担任这个工作，为了多串通几个人，她们到沁市、曲冢去动员老婆老汉说：“游击队给咱办事，咱们不能亏心，不能让汉奸把游击队害了，咱们帮助探情报吧！”老人们都点头称赞说：“皇天在上，游击队是咱们自己人，咱们还能不管。”于是十多个老婆老汉组成一个秘密情报小组，每天活动在敌人的据点里。游击队有了这么多的耳目，敌人的一举一动，甚至吃什么饭也都知道的清清楚楚，依靠情报灵通，曾经打跑南官庄五十几个骚扰的敌人；并大闹柏乡镇，赶走高村敌人，打得敌人远远离开他们。
    游击队扎下根以后，周围三、五里的南官庄敌人退了，高村敌人被民兵点了炮楼，柏乡敌人陷于孤立，不久也悄悄撤退了。于是民兵们有了二十五里地没有敌人的大地。
    在三区总结这一时期工作时指出，由于这一支神奇的游击队纵横敌后格子网里，打开局面：（一）使沁市周围九十个村庄的群众能安心度日，同时沁阳四区群众也有了转移的根据地。（二）附近曲冢、沙沟等二十余村自动找沁市村联防，沁阳四区的高村柏乡等十余村，也要找沁市联防，因为他们认为沁市游击队很顶事。（三）游击队由十几人发展到一百余人，成为一支战斗力很强的队伍。沁阳独立营作战也找沁市游击队配合，十二月下旬，这块地区开始进行土地改革，于是以沁市游击队为首，带领民兵深入沁、孟二县活动，掩护群众进行分田斗争。人们称沁市民兵为济源的“第二个杜八联”。
