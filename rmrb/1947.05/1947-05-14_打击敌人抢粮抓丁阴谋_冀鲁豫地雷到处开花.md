　　Striking at the Enemy's Plot to Seize Grain and Enlist Men
    Hebei-Shandong-Henan Landmines Blossom Everywhere
    [Reported by this newspaper] From December of last year to the end of March this year, the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Military Commission General Association successively held two training sessions on explosives, training more than 100 armed cadres above the district level. In the initial training, trainees thought learning about landmines was dangerous. During the learning process, they conducted multiple experiments and exercises on the structure and performance of various landmines, as well as the burying, camouflage, and manufacturing of detonators, which boosted everyone's morale. Now they have returned to their original posts, actively training militia, and are confident in using explosives to kill and wound the enemy in large numbers!
    Comrade Jin Yisan of the Changqing Military Commission of the First Sub-district, through careful research and patient education of the Taixi militia, has already fired the first shot. On March 13, the Second District Command of the county, based on intelligence from various sources, estimated that the enemy in Changqing might set out to seize grain and enlist men. That night, Comrades Wen Dong and Dai Dong led the militia to bury three landmines north of Pingfangjia. On the morning of the 14th, the Chiang bandits in Changqing indeed set out. As they reached the levee, they stepped on the landmines, killing or wounding eight enemies on the spot, scaring the invading Chiang bandits into fleeing in panic. Militiamen in another district buried a landmine at the Zhanghou ferry crossing on the north bank of the Wen River, and on the 16th, they also blew up a special agent. The explosives movement is now underway in the county.
    The enemy at Black Tiger Temple constantly looted grain, enlisted men, and murdered the masses in the vicinity of the Second and Fourth Districts of Kunshan County. On the evening of April 22, the county militia explosives team, led by Director Yang of our Seventh Branch and the political work section chief of the county armed forces, made a long-distance raid to the levee half a li from the stronghold and buried three landmines. At dawn on the 23rd, the enemy set out towards Shouzhangji. As they reached the bottom of the levee, they stepped on the landmines. With a loud boom, the lives of eleven dogs were lost. On the same day, the enemy from the stronghold advanced in several directions towards Yeli, Houmo, Wangsunzhuang, and other places. At this time, our militia, in coordination with the Shouzhang team, had already laid an ambush. When the enemy entered our ambush circle, our militia immediately opened fire fiercely, scaring the Chiang bandits into fleeing like sheep in all directions. At this time, we bravely pursued them to the Xiaojing River bank, where the enemy was again killed or wounded, with fifteen casualties, and a squad leader was captured alive, along with a rifle seized. We suffered no casualties.
    On the evening of March 26, the explosives team of our Border Association, led by instructor Wei Xinmin and explosives officer Chen Jinshuo, crossed the Yellow River with nine explosives team members, in coordination with the militia of the Seventh District of Qiongcheng, and arrived near the Dongkou stronghold in the district. They buried a landmine and disguised another as a "straw man mine" on the levee. The head of the straw man was a landmine, and its two hands held small flags, one reading, "Chiang Kai-shek is a traitor, and the Home Return Corps are bastards." The other read, "Welcome patriotic compatriots in the Central Army to withdraw from the civil war as soon as possible." On the morning of the 27th, the enemy from the stronghold, lured by the gunfire of our militia, pursued them to the levee. When they reached the bottom of the levee and saw the small flags held by the straw man cursing them, the enemy, filled with anger, rushed up and knocked the straw man down. There was a loud bang, and the enemy fell with the straw man, their lives also ended. When the enemy saw the dog's flesh and blood flying into the sky, they were frightened and fled in panic. As the enemy retreated in a panic, they stepped on the large landmine we had pre-buried. From then on, the enemy at the stronghold dared not go out until they were more than ten li away from the stronghold. Now, hundreds of thousands of militiamen in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region have learned how to use landmines.

　　打击敌人抢粮抓丁阴谋
    冀鲁豫地雷到处开花
    【本报讯】冀鲁豫武委总会由去年十二月起至今年三月底，先后开办爆炸训练两期，共训了百余名区级以上的武装干部。在初期训练时学员认为学习地雷危险，在学习中将各种地雷构造和性能以及埋设伪装制造雷管，均进行了多次试验与演习，大家情绪提高了。现已返回原来工作岗位，积极训练民兵，有信心以爆炸大量杀伤敌人！
    一分区长清武委会金益三同志经过细心钻研，耐心教育泰西民兵，已打响第一炮。于三月十三号，该县二区指挥部根据各方情报估计长清之敌可能出发抢粮抓丁，当晚由文东岱东两同志率领民兵到平坊家北埋设地雷三颗。十四日早长清蒋贼果然出发了，一行至大堤下即将地雷踏响，敌当场死伤八名，吓的该进犯蒋贼即狼狈而逃。另一区民兵在汶河北岸张候渡河口埋设地雷一颗，十六日又炸特务一名。现该县爆炸运动正在开展中。
    黑虎庙之敌不断向我昆山县二四区一带抢粮抓丁，杀害群众。于四月廿二日晚，该县民兵爆炸队在我七分会杨主任和县武的政工股长率领下，长途奔袭至该据点半里许之大堤上，埋设地雷三颗。廿三日天刚发亮，敌即出发向我寿张集方向前进，行至该堤下又踏上地雷，只听轰轰的声音，十一条狗命又完蛋了。同日该据点之敌又分数条向我叶那里、后莫、王孙庄等方向前进。这时我民后配合寿张队早已埋伏好了，当敌人进入我伏击圈内时，我民兵即猛烈射击，吓的蒋贼溃兵如羊，四处逃跑。这时我即勇敢追击至小青河岸，敌又被打的伤亡了十五名，并活捉班长一名，缴获步枪一支，我无伤亡。
    我边会爆炸队于三月廿六日晚由该队指导员魏新民，爆炸干事陈金锁两同志带领爆炸队员九名渡过黄河，配合邛城七区民兵，到达该区附近之董口据点附近，埋设地雷一颗，大堤上并伪装一颗“草人雷”，头部就是地雷，两只手拿着小旗子，一面写的是“蒋介石是卖国贼，还乡团是王八蛋。”另一面写的是“欢迎中央军里的爱国同胞及早退出内战火坑。”廿七日早晨该据点之敌在我民兵枪声引逗之下，即向大堤上追击。当追至大堤下头，望见草人手持之小旗是骂他们的，这时该敌恶气斗牛的冲上去，将草人打倒。只听到轰的一声，该敌也随草人而倒，小命也完蛋了。敌人看见这条狗的骨肉飞天了，即吓的抱头逃窜，当敌狼狈逃退时，又踏上我预埋的大地雷。从此后该据点之敌每出发时都是走出十里以外才敢上路。现在冀鲁豫区已有民兵数十万都学会使用地雷。
