　　Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 8th: During the Battle of Tai'an, all 300,000 people in the county fully assisted in the war effort, transporting supplies and ammunition day and night. The broad masses of women milled flour and husked rice day and night. One district supplied 150,000 jin of provisions to the front lines within three days. After the battle began, women from Sulin and Zhao Zhuang districts, who had fled to other villages during the KMT occupation, returned home one after another to participate in the work of caring for the wounded.
    Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 8th: The Binhai local armed forces, in coordination with a certain unit, swept away the "Home Return Corps" south of the Lin(yi)-Qing(jiang) Road. From April 8th to 30th, they fought more than ten battles, eliminating more than 500 enemies, seizing more than 40 long and short guns, and recovering a vast area of 3,000 square kilometers west of Huandunbu to Xiangzhuang Lake, north of Yushan to Sanwulin Village, and east of Daguanzhuang Shutuo River. Currently, with the exception of the main force of the stubborn enemy at Huandunbu on the Shutuo River, the "Home Return Corps" west and south of Huandunbu have been largely eliminated. A part of the local armed forces has advanced to the Shanzigu line, taking advantage of the victory to expand the results of the battle towards the west of the river.

    【新华社山东八日电】泰安之战中，该县卅万人民全力助战，日夜运送给养弹药。广大妇女日夜磨面辗米，某区三天内供给前线十五万斤给养。战斗开始后，在蒋占期间逃难外乡之粟林与赵庄区妇女，纷纷回家，参加看护伤员工作。
    【新华社山东八日电】滨海地方武装配合某部横扫临（沂）青（江）路南“还乡团”，（四月八日至卅日）作战十余次，歼敌五百余，缴长短枪四十余支，收复欢墩埠至项庄湖以西，羽山至三五林村以北，大官庄沭河以东，计三千平方公里之广大地区。现沭河更除欢墩埠尚有顽军主力外，欢墩埠以西以南之“还乡团”已大部肃清。地方武装一部已进迫山子古一线，乘胜向河西扩张战果。
