Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th: A comprehensive report: The disputes between the upper-level leaders of the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League have not been lessened by the "mediation" of the new British Governor-General Mountbatten. Mountbatten's first "work" after arriving in India was the partition plan for the provinces of Bengal and Punjab proposed by the ruling Congress Party. Jinnah, in a statement on the 30th, considered the partition of the two provinces to be an insidious act, and he still insisted on the entire "Pakistan." The Congress Party's plan was also opposed by Legislative Minister Mandal (Mandal is a leader of the non-Congress Untouchable class). In this uncoordinated situation, the Indian Constituent Assembly controlled by the Congress Party held its third meeting on April 28th. The second largest party, the Muslim League, which had not participated all along, was still absent, and many representatives of the princely states also did not attend. As a result, the Constituent Assembly was still Nehru's solo performance, and it hastily concluded on the 2nd. India's hope lies in the countryside. The peasant movement demanding land is expanding daily, and in some places it has developed into armed struggle. This has shaken the old order, which is what Gandhi and Jinnah described as "illegal riots" in their joint statement of April 15th. These Congress and League leaders, who are increasingly becoming enemies of the broad masses of India, demand the "suppression of all riots and acts of disorder." This not only shows the growing strength of the Indian masses, but also exposes the lack of future for these new nobles.

### 印度的希望在农村  农民运动日益扩展  制宪会议只是尼赫鲁独唱

　　印度的希望在农村
    农民运动日益扩展
    制宪会议只是尼赫鲁独唱
    【新华社陕北五日电：】综合报导：印度国回两党上层领袖之间的纷争，并未因英国新总督蒙特巴顿的“调解”而有所减弱。蒙特巴顿抵印以后的第一件“作品”是通过执政的国大党提出的孟加拉省与旁遮普省的分治计划。金纳在三十日发表谈话，认为两省的分治是一种阴险行为，他还是坚持整个的“巴基斯坦”。国大党的计划也同时受到立法部长孟达尔的反对（孟达尔是非国大党贱民阶级的上层领袖）。在这不协调的情势下，国大党控制的印度制宪会议于四月二十八日开第三次会议，一直没有参加的第二大党回盟还是不出席，许多土邦的代表也还是不到会。这么一来，制宪会议就还是尼赫鲁在那里唱独脚戏，它已于二日草草结束了。印度的希望在农村，农民要求土地的运动日益扩展，某些地方发展成为武装斗争，这就动摇了旧秩序，这就是甘地与金纳四月十五日联合声明中所描绘的“不守法律的暴动行为”。这两个日益为印度广大群众为敌的国回领袖，要求“压制所有暴动与无秩序之行为”，这不仅显示了印度群众力量的日趋壮大，也暴露了这些新贵的没有前途。
