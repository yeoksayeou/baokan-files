　　United Action to Achieve the People's Program
    General Secretary of the Communist Party of America, Dennis
    (This is the full text of the third section of the political report "The People Against the Trusts" made by Dennis, General Secretary of the Communist Party of America, at the plenary session of the National Committee of the Communist Party of America from December 3 to 5, 1946. – Editor)
    The post-election outlook can be summarized as follows: the forces of reaction will grow, the struggle will intensify, and new political combinations will form.
    The most urgent question now is: how to stop and defeat the arrogance and reactionary offensive of speculators, economic royalists, war-mongers and pro-fascists fueled by the Republican election victory!
    Obviously, the most decisive immediate task facing all progressive workers (both non-Communists and Communists) is to achieve unity in action by uniting the entire labor movement and all anti-fascist and democratic forces. It is to form a broader, more combative labor-progressive-democratic alliance that can unite all anti-monopoly capital and anti-war elements and groups, regardless of political, trade union and religious differences. It is to unite the democratic camp around a common program of struggle for jobs, security, equal rights, progress, democracy and peace for everyone, and to advance towards a new progressive political combination under labor leadership.
    To achieve this goal, the most extensive common action must first be realized at all levels of the Industrial Union Council, the American Federation of Labor and the Railway Workers' Association in various localities.
    Labor unity, or what else?
    No anti-fascist lightly ignores the gains that the reactionaries have made and the price that the American people have already had to pay due to the divisions that exist in the trade union movement. No progressive can ignore, for example, the divisive and dangerous role and influence played by the American Federation of Labor bureaucracy in the November primaries, or the reactionary and divisive program for workers drawn up by the recent American Federation of Labor congress.
    Therefore, every progressive worker and anti-fascist must understand more than ever before: if we want to stop and defeat the growth of reactionary forces and fascism, then not only is it indispensable to strengthen the organization and unity of the Industrial Union Council, but, as a matter of life and death, we must break down the "iron curtain" that now artificially separates the masses of the American Federation of Labor members from the Industrial Union Council and other progressive forces.
    That is to say, the only most decisive problem now facing the labor-progressive camp is to establish the broadest unity of action between the Industrial Union Council, the American Federation of Labor and the Railway Workers' Association around a program of anti-monopoly capital and anti-fascist struggle. This militant worker unity in action, more than anything else, can enable the working class to resist the attack of big capital, can enable them to play a leading role in national issues, and can build a strong democratic alliance and a new progressive front.
    This is why special, maximum attention must be resolutely paid to strengthening workers' common action on one or several issues. This action is based on a factory or urban and rural area, as well as a state and even national scale. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to arouse all workers and every progressive person to be vigilant against the conspiracy of the government and employers against the coal miners, which is fueled by Lewis's arbitrary and irresponsible policies, but in any case, this is a conspiracy that threatens wage increase demands, trade unions and the democratic rights of every American worker. Therefore, every effort must be made to force the government to grant the miners' demands and withdraw its injunctions and accusations against workers for contempt of the law, and every effort must be made to unite the Industrial Union Council, the American Federation of Labor and the Railway Workers' Association at the local and national levels to actively support the miners, and ensure that their just struggle cannot be destroyed from the outside or betrayed from the inside.
    Unified Action on Wage Issues
    At the same time, every effort must be made to establish unified worker action locally and at all levels of organizations to support the wage increase demands planned by the Industrial Union Council and wage increases for all workers and employees. These wage increase movements and the upcoming strike struggles must be dealt with in a new way, as a major part of the current people's struggle against the reaction of monopoly capital, inflation and speculation. In addition, these wage increase demands and strikes must be realized in a unified form, they must be a common struggle for all workers to collectively seek solutions to a common, national problem, rather than the pain of one line or one industry.
    It is not only a matter of wages, but also a matter of inflation and economic chaos.
    This common action of labor on wage issues should be combined with the organization of joint labor-progressive committees to oppose the passage of oppressive labor laws, to oppose the reduction of social welfare funds, to oppose the Republican-controlled 80th Congress being responsible for federal housing and public works, and to launch unified action by the Industrial Union Council, the American Federation of Labor and the Railway Workers' Association in various states (especially now in Massachusetts, Nebraska, Arizona and South Dakota) to cope with and strive to abolish the anti-labor laws passed by those states on November 5.
    In this regard, no effort must be spared to enable American Federation of Labor organizations to participate in movements such as the January Progressive Conference and actions in various urban and rural areas and states to fight for rent control and adequate housing plans. Similarly, a militant and systematic effort must be made to enable American Federation of Labor members to work together with the World Federation of Trade Unions, the unified and progressive center of the world trade union movement, which defends the security, progress and peace of all working people.
    Strengthen Progressive Workers
    In order to easily complete these urgent tasks, all progressive trade union workers, especially Communists, must immediately and fundamentally change their work for the American Federation of Labor, strengthen their foundation and influence in the American Federation of Labor, promote and support the re-formation of every progressive movement and combination in the American Federation of Labor, and constantly develop common or coordinated progressive actions of the Industrial Union Council and the American Federation of Labor in various localities.
    At the same time, the primary and decisive thing is to make every effort to strengthen the Industrial Union Council and its organizational movement; to jointly prepare and ensure the victory of the upcoming wage increase struggles in the steel, electrical, automotive, packaging and other industries; to resolutely refute and isolate anti-communists and consolidate the internal unity of the Industrial Union Council on its generally progressive policies, to strengthen the ongoing cooperation between leftists and the middle forces led by Murray in the Industrial Union Council, and to supplement this policy with systematic efforts in order to achieve a broader combination of forces within the Industrial Union Council to actively support the progressive policies and goals of the Industrial Union Council.
    For the integrity and combat effectiveness of the great Industrial Union Council and the entire labor movement, this necessity is a matter of life and death, that is, it is necessary to stop the destructive attempts of stubborn anti-communists in this progressive trade union center to "cleanse" any organization of the Industrial Union Council or carry out provocative and divisive activities, which attempts violate the will of the recent congress, which condemned the evil attempts of anti-communists to split the organization on the "red party" issue.
    When we have discussed the key issues of establishing unified labor action and a broad people's alliance above, we have mainly emphasized a central task, that is, the extreme need to achieve the maximum degree of unified struggle in all parts of the trade union movement. But at the same time, we must also focus significant attention on another key issue: that is, to further and more quickly develop the united front of Communist and non-Party workers, and to strengthen the supreme importance of the common action between the Communist Party in various places and all other anti-fascist people's organizations.
    The United Front of Communists and Non-Party Members
    At present, in several important national trade unions, a system of united front has been established by Party and non-Party trade union workers. These trade unions are characterized by: solid unity and sound internal conditions, continued growth and continuous improvement of the treatment and welfare of members' lives, and a progressive role in the political life of urban and rural areas and the country.
    Of course, there are also other trade unions, most of which are American Federation of Labor trade unions (although some are Industrial Union Council trade unions). In these trade unions, Communist workers are trampled and persecuted and are formally excluded from elected or appointed positions. The characteristics of most of these trade unions are roughly as follows: they are constantly divided by internal struggles, and they easily become victims of employer pressure and interference; they cannot grow or grow relatively slowly in times of "storm"; their wage levels or working conditions are generally lower than those obtained by trade unions led by progressive forces. In addition, these trade unions often take a hands-off attitude to the political struggles that the people carry out for the common good and national security; even if they participate in political struggles, they have always acted as "labor" echoes for a certain party of big capitalists. But this is only one side of the issue. Today, there are some well-known Communists in many united front organizations and movements. They are respected as Communists, but their participation in those organizations is only because they formally represent their trade unions or fraternities.
    As far as the formal relationship between Communists and the majority of non-Party groups is concerned, only a few states and a dozen or so cities have Communist Parties formally participating as an integral part of the people's and democratic front alliance in, for example, certain united front activities and organizations for progressive legislation, for peace, and for black rights. But whenever this happens, there is a vigorous, efficient, unified, people's democratic movement.
    In addition, there is now a popular and widespread situation in which Communists and various trade unions and political leaders informally establish understandings and friendly relations in order to promote progressive policies. There are dozens or hundreds of such cases. This cooperation is generally effective and successful, although the informal form of this cooperation is definitely hindering and limiting the effects and benefits derived from this cooperation.
    Excluding Communists is Helping the Reactionaries
    Now is the time, and the interests of the labor-progressive alliance also require it, that individual Communist Party members and non-Party workers should form a closer, more friendly day-to-day working relationship in every factory and in their mass organizations on the democratic basis of various people's organizations. It is equally important and urgent to establish and expand normal, harmonious, public political relations between the Communist Party and other labor and anti-fascist groups in all joint labor-progressive alliances and movements.
    This is necessary in order to strengthen the unified combat action of workers and the people, to stop and defeat the reactionary anti-communist offensive and its poisoning influence on the entire people's movement, and to protect and develop democracy.
    It must be known that any trade union or mass organization (even the huge Industrial Union Council) cannot be progressive for long if it excludes or attacks Communists. Any labor or democratic group or activity that excludes or vilifies any part of the anti-fascist movement, especially excluding and attacking the most consistent and resolute fighters against fascism and reactionaries, the Communists, cannot become or remain broad or effective.
    As American and world experience has proven, any attempt to not allow Communists to participate or not allow them to be elected as leaders, and to launch a so-called anti-communist movement of the working class or progressive organization, or a united front movement, cannot truly defend the interests of the people, and cannot effectively promote the cause of democracy and peace. Such a group or alliance will inevitably narrow its own foundation, degenerate, and be destined to first become a victim of anti-communists and reactionaries, and finally fall into the hands of anti-communists and reactionaries as a captive and tool.
    In order to strengthen the unity of action between Communists and non-Party members, we Communists, in addition to other things, have a responsibility to specifically answer the arguments raised by various leaders and groups with progressive tendencies who, for some reason, still oppose Communists forming a united front.
    For example: Several liberal and trade union leaders say that because we Communists advocate socialism, there cannot be unified action between us and those progressives who support and believe in capitalism.
    Of course, this "argument" is obviously unconvincing. Indeed, we Communists believe, and strive to convince our worker comrades that seeking a basic (socialist) solution to our common economic, political and social problems, that is, establishing the socialization of the means of production, is necessary.
    Our socialist solution is not proposed as a current task, nor is it proposed as an arbitrary "invention" of American Marxists arising from subjective wishes. We propose it as a scientific understanding of the path of social evolution. We know that the contradictory process of capitalist development, due to its inherent insolubility, will cause an increasingly broad mass of people to take action based on their own experience of struggle and the vanguard role of the Communist Party to ultimately realize the socialist road to the highest stage of democracy and progress.
    In addition, we are proposing a socialist solution in view of the qualitative superiority of the socialist system in domestic and world relations achieved by the Soviet Union in peace and war, which is shown in epoch-making manifestations. This capitalism is accompanied by cyclical crises, mass unemployment, dog-eat-dog competition, predatory imperialism, worldwide massacres and its fascist or near-fascist "solutions."
    But we are convinced that most progressives who do not understand or believe in socialism, as long as they are not prepared to deny or abandon all democratic freedoms and methods, cannot and will not refuse to grant Communists the right to promote our socialist views.
    As for all those who face the lessons of modern history squarely, it should be obvious that nowhere on any continent can the power of the people victoriously repel and decisively defeat fascist forces without the participation of Communists (full freedom and influential participation). During the national liberation war, Europe was one country after another to gain this understanding, and the recent faith in the Communist Party by the masses in elections and referendums has given us eyewitness proof.
    Even so, we Communists are not now proposing, nor will we propose in the near future, that the majority of our people outside the Communist Party should unite with us Communists to "establish socialism."
    What we are proposing now is that Party and non-Party workers and progressives should now join hands on a common current action program against reaction and fascism.
    What we are proposing now is that workers and their allies, regardless of trade union, race, religion and political differences, should establish a democratic front and carry out a common struggle today and tomorrow.
    What we are proposing now is that a united front of Communists and non-Party members should be established in order to increase the purchasing power of the masses, protect the people from inflation and the imminent economic crisis, and ensure the civil liberties of all nationalities (black and white, Jewish and non-Jewish), and most importantly, to restrain war-mongers and prevent fascism from coming to power in our country.
    In addition, we Communists know and believe that when the issue of labor and people's united action is rightly placed on this action program and based on it, most of the workers and progressives with very different political views and social views will embark on the road of anti-fascist and democratic solidarity in the current and gradually maturing economic and political struggles in order to defeat the reaction and fascism of monopoly capital, and will also continue to advance along the road of social progress.
    In order to form a broad and democratic anti-monopoly alliance under labor leadership that can effectively fight against the reactionaries, it is equally necessary to pay much greater attention to creating a new, cooperative working relationship between the progressive labor movement and their great allies, the black people, especially the middle classes in urban and rural areas. At the present time, the key link to completing this alliance is for labor to provide clear answers and practical leadership to solve the acute economic problems currently encountered by the vast majority of the American people.

　　统一行动以争取人民纲领之实现
    美共总书记  但尼斯
    （这是美共总书记但尼斯在一九四六年十二月三日至五日美共全国委员会全体会议上所作政治报告《人民反对托拉斯》的第三节全文。——编者）
    选举后的前瞻可以这样地总结：反动派力量将增长，斗争将尖锐化，新的政治结合的形成。
    现在最迫切的问题是：怎样阻止与击败由共和党选举胜利所助长的投机商、经济保皇党、战争贩子与亲法西斯分子之骄横与反动的攻势！
    显然，面临着一切进步工人（非共产党人与共产党人皆在内）的最具有决定性之直接任务是实现整个劳工运动与一切反法西斯的与民主的力量联合起来求得行动上统一。是结成一个更广泛，更具战斗性，能够不论政治、工会与宗教的差异将所有反独占资本与反战分子及集团团结在一起的劳工——进步——民主的联盟。是把民主阵营团结在一个争取每个人都有职业、安全与平等权利及争取进步、民主与和平的共同斗争纲领周围，向一个在劳工领导下的新的进步政治结合挺进。
    为了达到此一目的，首先必须使产业工会联合会，美国劳工联合会与铁路工人联谊会之各级组织在各地实现最广泛的共同行动。
    劳工的团结呢，还是别的？
    任何反法西斯人士皆不轻轻忽略反动派已得到的收获以及由于职工运动中存在的分裂，而使美国人民不得不已经付出的代价。任何进步人士皆不能忽视，例如美国劳工联合会官僚在十一月先举中所起的分裂性和危险性的作用与影响，或是由美国劳工联合会最近召开的大会所拟定的反动的与分裂工人之纲领。
    因此，每一个进步工人与反法西斯人士必须较过去任何时候更为了解：要想阻止与击败反动力量与法西斯主义的增长，那末不仅加强产联的组织与团结是不可或缺的，而且，作为一个生死存亡的问题，必须打破现在将劳联会员群众与产联及其他进步力量人为地隔离开来之“铁幕”。
    这就是说，现在面对劳工——进步阵营的唯一最具有决定性的问题是建立围绕在一个反独占资本与反法西斯斗争纲领周围的产联、劳联与铁路工人联谊会之间最广泛的行动上的统一。这种战斗性的工人统一行动较任何其它事情都更能够使工人阶级抵抗大资本的进攻，都更能够使他们在全国性的问题中起领导作用，以及建立一个强有力的民主联盟与一条新的进步阵线。
    这就是为什么必须坚决地把特别的、最大的注意放在增强工人对于一个或几个问题的共同行动上。而这种行动是以一个工厂或城乡以及全州甚至全国规模为基础的。为了达到这一目的，必须唤起全体工人和每个进步人士对政府与雇主反对煤矿工人阴谋的警觉，这种阴谋为路易斯的专断与不负责任的政策所助长，但无论如何，这总是一个威胁增资要求、工会与每个美国工人民主权利的阴谋。因此，必须竭尽一切努力迫使政府允诺矿工的要求，并收回其禁令及诬告工人蔑视法令之起诉，必须竭尽一切努力使产联、劳联与铁路工人联谊会在地方范围及在全国范围联合起来积极地支持矿工，并保证他们的正义斗争是既不能从外面摧毁，也不能由内部出卖的。
    对于工资问题的统一行动
    同时，必须尽一切力量在地方上及在各级机构中建立统一的工人行动以支持产联所计划的增资要求与所有工人与雇员的增资。对于这些增资运动以及行将到来的罢工斗争必须以一种新的态度去处理，做为目前人民反对独占资本的反动、通货膨胀与投机的斗争之主要部分来处理。此外，这些增资要求与罢工无论如何必须以统一的形态实现，必须是全体工人的共同斗争，集体求取解决一个共同的、全国性的问题，而不是一行或一业的痛苦。
    不仅是工资问题而是通货膨胀和经济混乱问题。
    劳工在工资问题上的此种共同行动应该与以下的事情结合起来，即组织各劳工——进步联合委员会，反对通过压迫劳工法律，反对减少社会福利经费，反对由共和党控制的第八十届国会来负责联邦住宅与公共工程工作，以及发动产联、劳联与铁路工人联谊会在各州（现在特别是在马萨诸塞、内布拉斯加、阿利桑那与南达科他）的统一行动以应付并争取废止各该州在十一月五日通过的反劳工法律。
    与此有关，必须不遗余力地使劳联各组织参加诸如正月进步分子会议一类的运动以及在各城乡与各州争取租金管制及足够的住宅计划等行动。同样地，必须重新做战斗性与有系统的努力俾使劳联会员与世界职工联盟协力合作，后者是世界职工运动之统一的进步中心，它捍卫着所有劳动人民的安全、进步与和平。
    加强进步工人
    为了易于完成这些迫切的任务，全体进步的职工工作者，特别是共产党人，必须立即基本地改变他们对于劳联的工作，加强他们在劳联中的基础与影响，促进与支持劳联中每一个进步的运动与结合的再形成，并在各地不断地发展产联与劳联共同的或配合的进步行动。
    同时，首要的与具有决定意义的是：尽一切力量加强产联与其组织运动；共同准备与保证在行将到来的制钢、电气、汽车、包装等工业中增资斗争之胜利，坚决地驳斥与孤立反共分子以及在产联一般进步的政策上巩固其内部之团结，加强产联中左翼分子和以莫莱为首的中间力量之间正在进行的合作并以系统之努力补充此一政策，以便在产联内部达到一个更广泛的力量结合，使其积极地支持产联的进步政策与目的。
    对于伟大的产联与整个劳工运动之完整性及战斗效率来说，这种必要是属于生死攸关性质的，即必须阻止此一进步职工会中心里面顽固不化的反共分子“清洗”产联任何组织或者进行挑拨分裂活动之破坏性的企图，这种企图是违反了最近召开的大会意志，后者曾斥责反共分子在“赤党”问题上分裂组织之万恶企图。
    以上我们论及建立统一劳工行动与广泛人民联盟之关键问题时，曾主要地强调一个中心任务，即达成职工运动中一切部分最大程度统一斗争之极端需要。但同时也必须将重大的注意集中在另一个关键问题上：即进一步并更快地发展共产党与非党工人的统一战线以及加强各地共产党与一切其它反法西斯的人民团体间之共同行动这个至高无上的重要任务。
    共产党人与非党人士的统一战线
    目前，在若干重要的全国性职工会中，党与非党职工工作者已建立起一个统一战线体系。这些工会的特点是：巩固的统一与健全的内部情况，继续生长与会员生活待遇及福利之不断改善，以及在城乡与全国的政治生活中所起的进步作用。
    当然，也有另外一些工会，多数是劳联的工会（虽然有些是产联的）。在这些工会里，共产党工人遭到蹂躏与迫害并正式被摈于选任职或委任职之外。这里工会多数的特点大致如下：不断地为内争所分裂，并且很容易变成雇主压力与干涉下的牺牲品；在“暴风雨”的时期他们不能生长或者是生长得比较缓慢；他们的工资水准或工作条件一般地总是比进步力量领导的工会所得到的工资水平为低。此外，这些工会对于人民为了共同利益与国家安全所进行的政治斗争经常采取袖手旁观态度；即使他们参加了政治斗争，也一贯是给大资本家某个政党充当“劳工”方面的应声虫。但这只是问题的一方面。今天，在许多统一战线组织与运动中有一些闻名的共产党人。他们以共产党人资格被人尊重，但他们的被允许参加那些组织是仅仅因为他们正式代表他们的工会或联谊团体。
    仅就共产党人与大多数非党集团的正式关系而论，只有几个州和一二十个城市共产党是以一个人民的与民主战线联盟的完整部分而正式参加到例如某些统一战线活动和争取进步立法、争取和平与争取黑人权利组织里的。但每当此种情况发生，就会有一个旺盛的、有效率的、统一的、人民的民主运动。
    此外，现在还有一种流行而普遍的情况，即共产党人与各职工会，各政治领袖之间非正式地成立谅解与友好关系以便增进进步政策，这种事有几十件或数百件之多。此种合作一般地是有效果的有成就的，虽然此种合作之非正式形式是确定地要妨害与限制由此种合作而得来的效果与裨益的。
    排除共产党即帮助反动派
    现在恰是时候了，同时劳工——进步联盟的利益也要求这样，即在各种人民团体的民主基础之上，共产党员个人应该和非党工人在每个工厂里和他们的群众团体中结成一种更密切，更友好的日常工作关系。同样重要的是迫切需要在一切劳工——进步的联合与运动当中，建立与扩大共产党与其他劳工和反法西斯团体之间的正常的谐协的公共政治关系。
    这是必须的，以便加强工人与人民的统一战斗行动，制止与挫败反动的反共攻势及其对整个人民运动的毒害影响，并保护与发展民主。
    必须确知：任何工会或群众团体（甚至是庞大的产联）如果排斥或攻击共产党人就都不能长期是进步的。任何劳工或民主团体或活动如果排斥或诋毁反法西斯运动之任何一部分，特别是排斥与进攻反对法西斯与反动派最一贯最坚决的战士共产党人，那末即不可能变成或保持其广泛性或有效性。
    正如美国与世界经验所证明的，任何企图不使共产党参加或不许他们被选为领导者以及发动一个所谓反共运动之工人阶级的或进步的组织或者是统一战线运动皆不能真正保卫人民的利益，皆不能有效地增进民主与和平事业。此种团体或联盟不可免地将使本身的基础变为狭隘、退化并注定要首先变为反共分子与反动分子的牺牲品，而终于沦为反共分子与反动分子的俘虏及工具。
    为了加强共产党员与非党人士行动的统一，我们共产党人除了其他事情以外还有责任具体地回答那些由于某种原因仍然反对共产党人结成统一战线的各种具有进步倾向领袖与集团所提出的论据。
    例如：若干自由主义与职工领袖说，由于我们共产党人主张社会主义，因而在我们和那些支援并相信资本主义的进步人士之间不能有统一行动。
    当然，这种“论据”是显然不能使人折服的。的确，我们共产党人相信，并努力使我们工人同伴确信对我们共同经济、政治与社会问题觅取一个基本的（社会主义的）解决方案，也就是建立生产工具的社会化乃是必要的。
    我们的社会主义解决方案不是作为当前任务提出的，也不是作为从主观愿望中产生的美国马克思主义者之专断“发明”而提出的。我们是作为对于社会进化之途径的科学认识而提出它的。我们知道资本主义发展的矛盾过程，由于其固有的不可解决性，将使日益广泛的群众根据他们自己的斗争经验与共产党的先锋作用而采取行动以最终实现走向民主与进步最高阶段之社会主义道路。
    此外，我们是有鉴于在划时代的表现中显示出来的平时与战时苏联所达到的在国内与世界关系上社会主义制度较无政府的与反动的资本主义之质量上的优越性而提出社会主义解决方案的，此种资本主义是伴随着周期循环的危机、大批失业、你死我活的竞争、掠夺性的帝国主义、世界性的屠杀与其法西斯主义或接近法西斯主义之“解决方案”。
    可是我们确信大多数不了解或不相信社会主义之进步人士，只要他们不准备否认或摒弃一切民主的自由与方式，即不能或不会拒绝给予共产党人以提倡我们的社会主义观点之权利。
    至于所有正视现代历史教训的人们来说，这应该是明显的，即在地球上任何一个大陆上，没有一个地方人民的力量可以没有共产党人的参加（充分自由与有影响的参加）而能胜利击退并且有决定性地击败法西斯力量的。在民族解放战争期间，欧洲便是一个国家又一个国家相继得到这种认识，而最近选举与复决中群众对共产党的信仰又给予我们以亲眼目击的证明。
    虽然如此，我们共产党人现在并不建议，也不在最近的将来建议，要共产党以外的我国多数人民应和我共产党人联合起来“建立社会主义”。
    我们现在所建议的是，党与非党工人与进步分子，现在应在一个共同的当前的行动纲领上携起手来反对反动与法西斯主义。
    我们现在所建议的是，工人们与他们的同盟者，不管工会、种族、宗教及政治的差异应建立一个民主阵线，并在今日和明日进行共同斗争。
    我们现在建议的是，应建立一个共产党人与非党人士之统一战线以便增加群众之购买力，保护人民使免于通货膨胀及即将到来的经济危机之侵害以及确保一切民族（黑人与白人，犹太人与非犹太人）之公民自由，而最重要的是约束战争贩子与防止法西斯主义在我国当权。
    此外，我们共产党人知道而且相信：当劳工和人民统一行动的问题端正的摆在这种行动纲领之上并以之为基础时，大部分的工人和政治见解社会观点却极不相同的进步分子就会在目前的和逐渐成熟的经济政治斗争中走上反法西斯和民主团结的道路，以挫败独占资本的反动与法西斯主义，并且也将循着社会进展的道路继续前进。
    为了在劳工领导之下结成一个能有效与反动派斗争的，广泛而民主的，反独占的联合起见，同样也必须以更大得多的注意力去在进步劳工运动与他们的伟大同盟者黑种人中间，尤其是与城乡中等阶级造成一种新的、通力合作的工作关系。在目前时机，完成这种联合的关键环节，就是要劳工方面提出明确的答案和实际的领导作用，去为绝大多数美国人民解决他们当前所遇到的尖锐的经济问题。（未完待续）
