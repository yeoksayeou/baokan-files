Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th.
    After the People's Liberation Army annihilated a large number of Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops in various places in April, it launched victorious counterattacks in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia and Shandong liberated areas in early May; it expanded its offensive in the central section of the Pinghan Railway; it continued to mop up the remaining enemies in the Jinan triangle area; it developed a strategic offensive on the Zhengtai Railway; and it also launched victorious offensives in Rehe and western Shanxi. From the end of April to the beginning of May, Chiang Kai-shek's army only played two tricks of trying to steal a chicken but losing the rice in Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia and Shandong; after the 89th Division and other units of the Chiang Kai-shek army in the Northeast were annihilated, they are now adopting a defensive posture of contraction.
    On April 26, Hu Zongnan gathered nine and a half brigades and fled from the Wayaobao area to Suide, attempting to drive the Northwest People's Liberation Army to the east bank of the Yellow River. However, on May 2, as soon as Hu's army entered Suide, its important rear stronghold, Panlong, was besieged, and its 167th Brigade headquarters and the 499th Regiment of the "Northwest Self-Defense Fifth Column" were completely annihilated. In addition to killing and wounding more than 1,400 people, its brigade commander Li Kungang and more than 5,700 people were all captured alive. A unit of the Guanzhong People's Liberation Army annihilated a unit of the 1st Cavalry Brigade in Hanguanzhuang, south of Tongguan, on the 4th. On the 5th, it captured Yao County, more than 170 miles north of Xi'an, annihilating the entire logistics department of the 85th Brigade of the 10th Reorganized Division and the 3rd Security Regiment. It killed, wounded, and captured more than 1,400 Chiang Kai-shek special commissioners including Yan Chongshi, and then actively withdrew from the city after completing the task of killing the enemy. Under this situation, Hu's army hurriedly fled back from Suide in its entirety, and Suide was immediately recovered by the People's Liberation Army.
    In Shandong, at the end of April, Chiang Kai-shek used the first-line forces of the Tang Enbo, Wang Jingjiu, and Ou Zhen groups, a total of thirteen reorganized divisions (of which the Fifth Army had not yet been reorganized), under the jurisdiction of thirty-four brigades, advancing from the broad area of Lin (Yi), Fei (County), Qu (Fu), and Si (Shui) to Tai'an, Xintai, Mengyin, and south of Yishui, attempting to find the main force of the People's Liberation Army for a "decisive battle." However, Chiang Kai-shek's army did not find any main force, and only falsely reported that it was "advancing in attack" here and "searching and attacking" there. However, the Shandong People's Liberation Army found three brigades of the 72nd Reorganized Division, one of Chiang Kai-shek's main forces, in late April and annihilated them all in Tai'an. The first-line thirty-four brigades of Chiang Kai-shek's army were now only thirty-one. Then the People's Liberation Army wedged in between Mengyin and Qingtuosi to its east, and by May 2, it had completely controlled the highway between Mengyin and Qingtuosi and the highway between Fei County and Sishui, and annihilated parts of the 19th Brigade, 44th Brigade, and 63rd Brigade of the 83rd Division. In addition to killing and wounding them, 3,500 were captured alive. Chiang Kai-shek's army is still taking the risk of advancing north, and it is expected that it will encounter even greater failure.
    In the central section of the Pinghan Railway, after General Liu Bocheng's troops annihilated the Second Rapid Column of Chiang Kai-shek and other units, they launched the Tangyin Campaign on May 1, liberating Tangyin City in a six-hour battle and capturing Sun Dianying, the commander of the temporarily compiled 3rd Column, which was originally the puppet Sixth Route Army, with none of his more than 9,100 subordinates escaping. On the 6th, we also captured Cuijiaqiao, more than 20 miles east of Anyang City, and wiped out all 2,700 of Wang Zi's puppet People's Self-Defense Third Corps.
    On the Zhengtai Railway, the sharp edge of the Jin-Cha-Ji People's Liberation Army developed westward to Shijiazhuang. On the 2nd, it captured Pingding City, liberated the important town of Yangquan, and on the 4th, it captured Shouyang City. By this time, the entire Zhengtai Railway, extending more than 300 miles from the vicinity of Huolu in the east to Shouyang in the west, was under the control of the People's Liberation Army. The Jin-Ji and Taihang liberated areas were connected into one, and the connection between the Chiang Kai-shek Yan troops between Shijiazhuang and Taiyuan was completely cut off. In this battle, more than 10,000 people from the 71st Division of the Yan 33rd Army, the Provisional 46th Division (lacking one regiment), and the Independent 10th Column were annihilated. After Chiang Kai-shek's army, which was guarding the Baoding area, sneaked into Gaoyang City in central Hebei on the 2nd, it fled in panic in less than 2 hours, fearing annihilation, and dared not reinforce the Zhengtai Railway.
    On May 3, General Chen Geng's troops of the Taiyue area attacked the Yuncheng Airport, annihilating two battalions of the 2nd Brigade of the 206th Youth Army and seizing two airplanes. On the 4th, they also recovered Pinglu County and Maojindu, capturing more than 600 Chiang Kai-shek Yan troops. Currently, the Chiang Kai-shek army in southern Shanxi is only trapped in strongholds such as Anyi, Yuncheng, Xia County, and Yuanqu, while the People's Liberation Army in southern Shanxi is conducting new combat operations.
    On May 1, the Rehe People's Liberation Army attacked the Jinzhou-Chengde Railway line and captured Lingyuan City, killing, wounding, and capturing more than 1,000 members of the Northeast Security Third Detachment and police. Han Meicun, the commander of the Third Detachment, led three companies to revolt and immediately assisted the People's Liberation Army in clearing the remaining Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops. In this battle, more than 60 miles of railway between Lingyuan and Yebaishou were liberated.
    On May 3, a unit of the Shanxi People's Liberation Army ambushed the enemy harassing from Xin County and annihilated a unit of Yan's Provisional 39th Division. On the 7th, Wenshui City was recovered again. On the 9th, Xishe Town and Beihujiapu, northeast of Wenshui, were recovered, and a Yan security team was annihilated.
    According to incomplete statistics from the first ten days of May, the People's Liberation Army field army and local army killed and wounded a total of 7,100 Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops, captured more than 28,100 Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops including Li Kungang and Sun Dianying, and 300 Chiang Kai-shek troops revolted, totaling more than 35,500 people. In ten days, Chiang Kai-shek's army had invaded two liberated area county seats, and the People's Liberation Army liberated and recovered eight county seats, and abandoned one after liberation.

### 陕北山东我军胜利反击  平汉中段攻势继续扩大

专栏：五月上旬综合战报

    陕北山东我军胜利反击  平汉中段攻势继续扩大
    四月间解放军在各地大量歼灭蒋伪军后，五月初又在陕甘宁、山东两解放区进行胜利的自卫反击；在平汉线中段则扩大攻势；晋南三角地区继续扫荡残敌；正太线上发展战役进攻；热河、晋西亦胜利出击。而蒋军从四月底至五月初，仅在陕甘宁与山东两地耍了两次偷鸡不着反舍米的把戏；东北蒋军八十九师等部被歼后，现采取收缩防御。
    四月二十六日胡宗南凑了九个半旅，从瓦窑堡地区向绥德窜犯，图逐西北人民解放军于黄河东岸。但五月二日胡军甫入绥德，其重要后方据点蟠龙即被围击，其一六七旅旅部及四九九团“西北自卫第五纵队”等部完全被歼，除毙伤千四百余外，其旅长李昆岗以下五千七百余人全被生擒。关中解放军一部于四日在同官南韩官庄歼骑一旅一部后，五日一举攻克西安北百七十余里之耀县城，歼其整十师八五旅后勤部及保三团全部，毙伤俘蒋记专员阎崇师以下千四百余，于完成杀敌任务后主动撤离该城。在此种情势下，胡军乃慌忙由绥德全部回窜，绥德当即被解放军收复。
    山东方面，四月底，蒋介石以汤恩伯、王敬久、欧震三集团之第一线兵力，共十三个整编师（其中第五军尚未整编），下辖三十四个旅，分由临（沂）费（县）曲（阜）泗（水）宽广地带，向泰安、新泰、蒙阴及沂水以南并进，图找人民解放军主力“决战”。可是蒋军并没有找到什么主力，只谎报在这里“攻击前进”，在那里“搜索出击”。而山东解放军却在四月下旬找到了蒋主力之一的整七二师三个旅，在泰安将其全部歼灭。蒋军第一线三十四个旅，至此只剩下三十一个了。接着解放军又向蒙阴及其以东之青驼寺间楔进，战至五月二日，将蒙阴至青驼寺间公路及费县至泗水间公路全部控制，并歼其八三师之十九旅、四十四旅、六三旅各一部，除毙伤外，活捉三千五百。蒋军现仍冒险北进，预料将遇到更大的失败。
    平汉中段，刘伯承将军所部歼蒋第二快速纵队及其他等部后，五月一日进行汤阴战役，以六个钟头战斗解放汤阴城，生俘原伪六方面军后改暂编三纵队司令孙殿英，其部下九千一百余无一漏网。六日我又克安阳城东二十余里之崔家桥，将伪人民自卫第三总队王自全部二千七百余扑灭。
    正太线上，晋察冀解放军锐锋向石家庄以西发展，二日克平定城，解放阳泉重镇，四日克寿阳城，至此正太线东迄获鹿附近，西至寿阳三百余里全由解放军控制。冀晋与太行两解放区联成一片，而石家庄与太原间蒋阎军的联系完全切断，是役阎三三军七一师、暂四六师（缺一个团）及独立十纵队等部万余人就歼。据守保定地区之蒋军二日窜入我冀中高阳城后，因慑于被歼，不到二小时即仓惶逃出，亦不敢向正太线增援。
    太岳区陈赓将军所部三日攻入运城机场，歼青年军二○六师二旅两个营，并缴飞机两架。四日又光复平陆县城及茅津渡，俘蒋阎军六百余。现晋南蒋军仅困守安邑、运城、夏县、垣曲等据点，晋南解放军则正在进行新的作战行动。
    五月一日热河解放军向锦承铁路线上攻击，当克凌源城，毙伤俘东北保安三支队及警察千余；其三支队司令韩梅村率三个连起义，并即协助解放军扫清残余蒋伪。是役解放凌源至叶柏寿间铁路六十余里。
    五月三日晋西解放军一部，伏击忻县出扰之敌，歼阎暂三九师一部。七日，再度收复文水城。九日收复文水东北之西社镇及北胡家堡，歼阎一个保安队。
    综合五月上旬不完全统计，解放军野战军及地方军，毙伤蒋伪军共七千一百余人，俘蒋伪军李昆岗孙殿英以下二万八千一百余人，蒋军起义者三百余，共三万五千五百余人。十天中蒋军曾侵占解放区县城两座，解放军解放及收复县城八座，解放后又放弃者一座。
