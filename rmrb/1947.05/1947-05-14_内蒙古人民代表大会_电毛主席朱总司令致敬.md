Inner Mongolia People's Congress
Sends Respects to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu
(Xinhua News Agency, West Manchuria, 12th) The Inner Mongolia People's Congress passed a telegram to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu to express their respects. The original telegram stated: "Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu: We extend our heartfelt gratitude with unparalleled enthusiasm. For three hundred years, the Mongolian people have been oppressed by Han chauvinism, and the suffering is beyond description. Only the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army under your leadership have saved the Mongolian people from their tragic fate. In the future, we firmly believe that under your wise leadership, the future of the Inner Mongolian people is infinitely bright. We only express to you: We will certainly unite the ethnic groups internally and unite with all ethnic groups in the country to thoroughly crush Chiang Kai-shek's offensive and build a peaceful and democratic new China and new Inner Mongolia, and we will not stop until we achieve our goal!"
(Xinhua News Agency, West Manchuria, 12th) The Inner Mongolia People's Congress passed a telegram on the 30th to express their respects to Stalin of the Soviet Union and Marshal Choibalsan of Outer Mongolia. It stated: "The unprecedented People's Congress in Inner Mongolia's history is being held, and we want to realize the people's will to establish an autonomous government of Inner Mongolia. The world's heroic and unparalleled Red Army and the brave sons of Outer Mongolia drove the Japanese aggressors out of Inner Mongolia. The blood of the Soviet-Mongolian soldiers who bravely sacrificed themselves for the liberation of the Inner Mongolian people is spread all over the Mongolian grasslands, and the Mongolian people will never forget them for thousands of generations. On the occasion of the convening of the Inner Mongolia People's Congress, we extend our deepest condolences to them, and extend our highest friendship and respect to you and the people of your country."
