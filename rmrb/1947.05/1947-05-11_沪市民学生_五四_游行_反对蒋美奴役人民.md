　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th. Shanghai: A fierce movement of students and citizens against the Kuomintang and the U.S. military has erupted again in Shanghai. On May 4th, citizens and students held a parade and demonstration against high prices and the speculative manipulation of bureaucratic capital, which actually turned into a parade and demonstration against the Party and the U.S. military. The demonstrators wrote and posted slogans everywhere, shouting slogans such as "Demand the immediate withdrawal of the U.S. military." Chiang Kai-shek's police and military police came out in force and acted ferociously, and several students were beaten. When the procession reached Avenue Joffre, the U.S. military police openly assisted, helping Chiang Kai-shek's military police arrest students posting slogans; at this point, the citizens' anger and indignation were aroused, and the students were spared from being arrested. This incident shocked the people of the city. On the morning of the 5th, hundreds of students from various schools in Shanghai held a meeting in the city hall, proposing conditions such as guaranteeing human rights, punishing the perpetrators, compensating the injured students, and guaranteeing that such incidents would not happen again. Chiang Kai-shek's Shanghai Mayor Wu Guozhen was forced to meet with student representatives, but in addition to agreeing to bear the medical expenses of the injured, he stubbornly refused to accept other conditions.

　　沪市民学生“五四”游行
    反对蒋美奴役人民
    【新华社陕北七日电】沪讯：上海又掀起学生与市民的剧烈反对国民党和反对美军的运动。五月四日市民与学生举行反对物价高涨与官僚资本投机操纵的游行示威，实际上则变成了与反对党与反对美军的游行示威。游行者到处写贴和高呼“要求美军立即撤退”等标语口号。蒋记警察宪兵纷纷出动，悍然行凶，学生数人当被殴伤。当游行行列行至霞飞路时，美国宪兵竟公然帮凶，协助蒋记宪兵逮捕张贴标语的学生；至此市民怒情愤激，学生才得未被捕去。此事发生后，震动了全市人民。五日晨，上海各学校学生数百人于市政府大厅开会，提出保障人权、惩办肇事凶手、赔偿受伤学生、并保证今后再不发生此类事件等条件。蒋记上海市长吴国桢被迫接见学生代表，但除应允负担受伤者医药费用外，蛮横的拒绝接受其他各项条件。
