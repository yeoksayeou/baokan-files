　　Bomb Factory Workers Participate in Production
    Save Wages and Grain to Support the Front Lines
    [This newspaper's Changzhi report] Seeing the response to the Central Bureau's call for thrift, Comrade Wang Qingxiang said, "We must not only produce well, but also contribute our wages and grain to support the front lines." Comrade Li Hezhi said, "Our workers must have our wives participate in production, reduce our demands on the household, lower our living standards, and save wages and grain to support the front lines." Instructor Niu Suotai further proposed: "Our own production should be like the troops at the front." Under this slogan, everyone contributed 1,500 jin of millet to support the front lines, and all 120-plus employees reported a total of 41,000 jin of millet. Furthermore, the factory established a Technical Research Committee. Through the research of Comrades Zhang Wanchang, Gao Xiulong, Wang Qingxiang, and others, the shell pressing machine was modified. Two pairs of small gears were used, spaced more than a foot apart in the middle, with one end pressing and the other end rocking. Sheet iron was clamped into the small gears, and a few turns would cut out the shells for more than twenty detonator tubes, saving two workers and increasing production tenfold. For rolling fuses, previously only one was rolled at a time, but after Wang Qingxiang's modification, it was changed to a long iron bar, rolling three at a time, which is twice as efficient as before.

　　炸弹所工属参加生产
    节省工资米支援前线
    【本报长治讯】某炸弹所全体职工看到了响应中央局节约号召，王庆祥同志说：“我们不只好好生产，而且还要拿出自己工资米来支援前线。”李何枝同志说：“我们工友要让自己女人参加生产，减少咱们对家中的供给，生活水平低一些，节约工资米支援前线。”牛所泰指导员更进一步提出：“自己生产要和前方部队一样。”在这样口号下，每人拿出一千五百斤小米支援前线，全体职工一百二十余人报出四万一千斤小米。又：该所成立技术研究委员会，经张万昌、高秀龙、王庆祥等同志研究，改造了压壳机子，用两对小牙轮，做成中间一尺多远，一头压一头摇，把洋铁片夹到小牙轮内，摇几圈就是二十多个爆发管的壳子剪妥了，能节省二个人工，而产量增加十倍。卷导火，过去一下卷一个，经王庆祥的改造，现改为长铁杠子、一下即卷三个，比过去提高一倍。（道兴）
