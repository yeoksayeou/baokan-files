　　Ping Shun Jingdi Village Men and Women Cheer Together
　　Completing Grain Sowing in Three Days
　　Xiyang Dongfengren and Other Villages are Now Rushing Spring Plowing

　　[Our newspaper, Taihang, 3rd dispatch] In Ping Shun 7th District, Jingdi Village, from the 23rd to the 26th of last month, all 420 mu of grain land were sown. The village has a total of 135 households and 1,276 mu of land. Ten able-bodied men joined the army, and another 37 joined the war effort, leaving only 39, each averaging 30 mu of land to cultivate. Initially, everyone thought that there was too little labor this year to deep plow and cultivate carefully, and even uncertain if all the land could be sown. After cooperative hero Zhang Jincheng, the village chief, and the political director discovered these thoughts, they held a mass meeting to discuss: deciding to organize the 100 able-bodied women, 57 semi-able-bodied people, and children into mutual aid teams. According to the village's geographical conditions, they were divided into three mutual aid brigades, and a sowing plan was drawn up to rush the sowing. Whichever brigade finished sowing first would then help the other brigades. Large plots of land were sown with animal-drawn plows, with children leading the animals. Men operated seed drills on smaller plots, with women pulling the drills. Women who knew how to plow took charge of the plows, freeing up male labor and livestock to harrow the land and deliver manure. This approach greatly boosted everyone's morale, and in three days, all 420 mu of grain land in the village were sown. The women showed the most enthusiasm during the sowing. Wang Xuezhe, already 42 years old, not only drove two animals to plow three mu of land a day but also spun one liang of thread by getting up early and working late. Women's Federation Chairman Yang Jinhua helped men pull the seed drill during the day, and also spun three liang of cotton in her spare time. After the land was sown, mutual aid team leader Xie Mancang happily said: "Before going to the fields, I was worried that I wouldn't be able to sow it all, but who knew that everyone would pitch in and we finished it in three days." This sowing saved a total of 112 male and female labor days.

　　[Our newspaper dispatch] The Xiyang County War Production Committee called on the entire county to mobilize urgently, with women and children working hard to participate in sowing. Those who can plow should plow, and those who can sow should sow, striving for "double victory in war and production." This call has been answered by various villages: The spring plowing preparations in Dongfengren in the 3rd District have been completely prepared (firewood, coal, rice, and noodles are sufficient for the entire village for three months, and an additional 1,947 loads of fertilizer have been accumulated); recently, under the leadership of labor hero Zhang Shuaicheng, the labor cooperative was reorganized, and a plan was drawn up. Currently, they are rushing spring plowing and sowing. The entire village has a total of 105 head of livestock. After Qingming Festival, 100 head of livestock were organized to deliver manure, and a total of 18,000 loads were delivered on the 15th. Three teams of oxen were organized to plow fallow land, and a total of 191.6 mu were plowed on the 12th. There are still 231.5 mu unplowed. Now, all livestock have been transferred to plowing fallow land (land sown only by hand) and plowing stubble land, which is expected to be completed five or six days before the Beginning of Summer. Three days after the Beginning of Summer, the land will be sown. Plowing and sowing will begin five days before the Grain Full, ensuring that spring plowing and sowing are completed five days before the Grain in Ear. Lin× village in the 7th District used to be very poor. Before spring plowing, in order to lay the foundation for a larger-scale production campaign this year, three transportation operations were organized over ten days, purchasing seven donkeys, two oxen, and 57 pigs, with an average of one head of livestock and two pigs per household in the village. Now, the masses in the entire village are jubilant and are rushing spring plowing and sowing.

　　[Our newspaper, Shexian dispatch] Twenty-five older boys and girls in Mabucun, 3rd district, are organized; they attend classes in the morning and help military families with production in the afternoon. Their active production enthusiasm has promoted the organization of male and female semi-able-bodied laborers throughout the village. The children have set a plan to complete the work of carrying manure and building embankments for military families and war participants within ten days. Within six days, they have transported 1,450 loads of manure to the fields. Everyone in the village admires the children's strength. Currently, the elderly have organized ten groups, and women have organized eighteen groups, with each group competing to complete tasks. (Feng Qi, Ke Xian, Xiang Qian)

　　平顺阱底村男女齐加油
    三天完成谷地下种
    昔阳东丰稔等村现正突击春耕
    【本报太行三日电】平顺七区阱底村，于上月二十三日至二十六日三天中将四百二十亩谷地全部下种。该村共一百三十五户，地一千二百七十六亩，男全劳力参军走了十个，参战又走了三十七个外，只剩了三十九个，每人平均种地三十亩。起初大家都认为今年劳力太缺，不能深耕细作了，甚至不能保险全部种上。合作英雄张金成和村长、政治主任发现了这些思想后，就召开群众会讨论：决定把一百个女全劳力，五十七个半劳力和儿童也都组织到互助组中来。按全村地理情况分成三个互助大队，订出下种计划，突击下种。那一大队先种完，再帮助其他队种，大块地下种由牲口拉，儿童牵牲口，小块地男人摇耧，由女人拉耧，女人会犁地的捉犁，腾出男劳力和畜力耙地、送粪，这样做法大家情绪很高，三天中把全村四百二十亩谷地种完啦。在下种中妇女们表现最积极，王雪则已四十二岁了，她除赶的两个牲口一天犁三亩地外，还要起早搭黑纺一两线。妇救主席杨金花白天帮男人拉耧，抽空还纺三两花。地种完后，互助组长谢满仓高兴的说：“没上地前，我光发愁种不过来，谁知大家都动手，三天就种完了。”这次下种共节省了男女劳力工一百一十二个。
    【本报讯】昔阳县战争生产委员会号召全县紧急动员起来，妇女儿童要努力参加下种，能耕的耕，能种的种，要争取“战争生产两胜利”。这一号召已得到各村的响应：三区东丰稔的春耕准备已完全作妥（柴煤米面足够全村三个月费用，另外还积肥一九四七驮）；最近在劳英张甩成领导下，重新整理了劳力社，订出了计划，现正突击春耕下种。全村畜力共一○五头，清明后就组织一百头畜力送粪，十五日共送出一万八千驮。又组织三犋牛耕茬地，十二日共耕一九一·六亩，还剩二三一·五亩未耕，现已将全部畜力转入翻点地（只用人工下种的地）与耕茬地，预计立夏前五、六日完成，立夏后三天可点完。接着翻种地，小满前五日翻完谷地开始下种，保证芒种前五天完成春耕下种。七区林×村过去很穷，春耕前为了打下今年更大规模生产运动的基础，又组织了三次运输，前后十天；买到了驴七头，牛两头，猪五十七口，全村每户平均牲口一头、猪两口。现全村群众喜气洋洋正在突击春耕下种。
    【本报涉县讯】三区马布村较大男女儿童二十五人组织起来，上午上课下午帮军属生产。他们积极生产热情推动了全村男女半劳力纷纷组织起来。儿童订计划在十日内给军属及参战人员完成担粪垡堰工作，六天内已运到地粪一千四百五十驮，全村的人无不羡慕儿童的力量。现老年已组织了十组，妇女组织了十八组，各组正竞赛完成任务。（凤岐、克贤、向前）
