　　Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 20th: *Dazhong Daily* here recently published an editorial entitled "A Great Victory of Decisive Significance," pointing out that the complete annihilation of the 74th Division, one of Chiang Kai-shek's direct line elite five main forces, is a great victory of decisive significance on the East China battlefield, and a signal that the People's Liberation Army is beginning to take the initiative and is about to move into a counter-offensive. The editorial then analyzes the significance of annihilating the 74th Division for the overall war situation: First, the 74th Division was Chiang Kai-shek's most trusted "Imperial Guard," which had been trained by the American advisory group for a long time. It was well-equipped and had a lot of combat experience, ranking first among Chiang Kai-shek's first-class main forces. Last year, when Chiang Kai-shek launched the civil war to invade the liberated areas, after other Chiang troops paid a heavy price of entire divisions and brigades, the 74th Division successively occupied counties such as Suqian, Siyang, Huaiyin, Huai'an, Baoying, Lianshui, Shuyang, Tancheng, and Linyi, thus becoming the backbone of Chiang Kai-shek's 800,000 troops attacking the East China liberated areas. A battalion commander of the division who laid down his arms in the Lianshui battle once said: "If the 74th Division is annihilated, no troops will be able to resist the People's Liberation Army. The People's Liberation Army can not only recover all the lost land, but no one can stop them even if they go to Nanjing." This shows the arrogance of the officers of the 74th Division, and also shows the importance of the 74th Division in Chiang Kai-shek's army. The annihilation of the 74th Division not only shows the strength of the people's army, which is sufficient to crush all the offensive forces of the Chiang-American reactionaries; on the other hand, it can also be concluded that the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries have suffered an extremely serious blow, which is even more powerful than annihilating several other divisions of their troops. Second, this time Chiang Kai-shek made a desperate "key offensive" against the central Shandong liberated area, concentrating the first-class and second-class main forces to advance side by side, with the strength of thirteen reorganized divisions to invade the Yimeng Mountains. In its deployment, the position of the direct line main force was painstakingly linked. The Gui系 7th Division and 48th Division were on the right wing, the 72nd and 75th Divisions were on the left wing, and the 74th Division, 11th Division, 5th Army and other direct line main forces were in the middle, advancing side by side. This not only strengthened the strength of the "key offensive," but also reduced the risk of the direct line main force being annihilated. (After continuous annihilation battles, the Chiang troops on the flanks were all in danger.) When the People's Liberation Army annihilated the 72nd Division in Tai'an, Chiang Kai-shek strictly ordered other troops to continue according to the original plan. Although some troops were very close to Tai'an, they watched the annihilation of the Sichuan army without going to rescue them. When the People's Liberation Army attacked the 83rd Division on the Lin (Yi) Meng (Yin) highway, Chiang Kai-shek and Chen Cheng, fearing that the 74th Division would be surrounded, personally went to Linyi to direct the deployment. Before the start of the second campaign of this summer offensive of the People's Liberation Army, the 5th Army and the 11th Division went north to take the left wing, and the 74th Division attacked from Mengyin, still in the middle. After being surrounded, Chiang Kai-shek strictly ordered the 83rd Division, 25th Division, 65th Division, 7th Division, and 48th Division to rush to reinforce from all directions, southeast, northwest. These all show that Chiang Kai-shek paid great attention to his direct line main force and did not let them be in a dangerous position. And he especially loved and supported the 74th Division. However, the 74th Division was finally annihilated. This shows that the strength of the People's Liberation Army can not only annihilate the Chiang troops on the flanks, but also annihilate them even if they are placed in the middle. The editorial also pointed out that after the complete annihilation of the 74th Division, it will make the morale of the Chiang troops even more depressed, and their combat will and combat effectiveness will be further reduced. Even on the East China battlefield, where Chiang Kai-shek concentrated nearly half of his existing forces attacking the liberated areas, it will start to decline from now on, and this will continue to the complete collapse of Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous and reactionary rule. This fate is even more certain. Finally, the editorial emphasized that the enemy still occupies many cities in the liberated areas, and there are still many difficulties ahead. Even in the counter-offensive period, there will still be difficulties and twists and turns. We must not be blindly optimistic, arrogant, or slack; but we must redouble our efforts, overcome difficulties, and persist in the struggle to meet the great counter-offensive that is about to come.

　　蒋军五大主力之一的覆灭显示蒋介石统治必将崩溃 
    大众日报评七十四师被歼
    【新华社山东二十日电】此间大众日报顷以《有决定意义的大胜利》为题发表社论，指出蒋介石嫡系精锐五大主力之一的七十四师全部就歼，是华东战场上具有决定意义的伟大胜利，是人民解放军开始取得主动、即将转入反攻的信号。社论继分析歼灭七十四师对整个战局的意义：第一、七十四师是蒋介石最亲信的“御林军”，经过美国顾问团长期训练，装备既好，作战经验又多，居蒋介石的一等主力中第一位。去年蒋介石发动进犯解放区的内战，在其他蒋军付出整师整旅的惨重代价后，由七十四师连续侵占宿迁、泗阳、淮阴、淮安、宝应、涟水、沭阳、郯城、临沂等县城，因而成为蒋介石进攻华东解放区的八十万军队的骨干。涟水战役放下武器的该师营长曾说过：“如果七十四师被歼灭了，就没有任何部队能抵抗解放军了。解放军不仅可以收复一切失地，就是要到南京也没有人能够阻拦。”这可以看到七十四师军官的自负程度，也可以说明七十四师在蒋介石军队中所占地位的重要。七十四师被歼灭了，既说明人民军队的强大，足以粉碎蒋美反动派的一切进攻力量；另一方面，也可以断定蒋介石反动集团所受到的打击是异常严重，比起歼灭它其他部队几个师还要厉害。第二、这次蒋介石对鲁中解放区作孤注一掷的“重点进攻”，集中第一等、第二等主力齐头并进，以十三个整编师的兵力向沂蒙山区进犯，在它的部署内，对嫡主力的位置是煞费苦心的系。桂系七师及四十八师在右翼，七十二、七十五等师在左翼，七十四师、十一师、第五军等嫡系主力在中间，齐头并进。这一方面加强了“重点进攻”的力量，一方面又减少了嫡系主力被歼灭的危险性。（经过不断的歼灭战，蒋军在侧翼者人人自危。）当解放军在泰安歼灭七十二师时，蒋介石严令其他部队仍遵原计划进行。虽然有些部队离泰安很近，但眼看着川军的覆灭而不去援救。当解放军在临（沂）蒙（阴）公路上打击八十三师时，蒋介石、陈诚怕七十四师被包围，亲自赶到临沂指挥部署。在这次解放军夏季攻势第二个战役开始前，第五军及十一师北上担任左翼，七十四师从蒙阴出犯，仍当中路。被包围以后，蒋介石严令八十三师、二十五师、六十五师、七师及四十八师从东南西北各方迅往增援。这些都说明蒋介石对它的嫡系主力是非常注意，不让他们处于危险地位。而对于七十四师，尤其爱护拥护。然而七十四师终被歼灭了。这说明人民解放军的力量不仅能歼灭蒋军的侧翼部队，就是放在中间的也一样能够歼灭它。社论并指出七十四师全部就歼以后，将使蒋军士气更为衰落，战斗意志及战斗力更为降低，就是在蒋介石集中它现有违攻解放区兵力将近一半的华东战场，它也从此要走下坡路，一直发展到蒋介石卖国反动统治的完全崩溃，这个命运是更加确定的了。最后，社论强调敌人还侵占解放区许多城市，前面还存在着不少困难，就是到反攻时期，也还有困难，还可能有曲折，不能盲目乐观，骄傲松懈；而要加倍努力，克服困难，坚持斗争，以迎接不久就要到来的大反攻。
