　　[This dispatch from our Hebei-Shandong-Henan office on the 4th] The masses in Hebei-Shandong-Henan are turning their hatred for the bandit Chiang into action by eagerly enlisting in the army. In Nanfeng County, following the last mass meeting of ten thousand people where sixteen hundred young and strong men poured into the new recruit corps, nearly two thousand more villagers have continued to sign up, with 140 young women also registering. The model women's squad leader of Qian Dong Village led four squad members to sign up for the army. Village Committees for Supporting the Army have been universally established, with high platforms built, and military families invited. Bright red couplets are pasted on the doorposts of military families, and "Glory" plaques are hung. Cadres and members of farmers' associations are guaranteeing that military families will not face any difficulties in plowing, harvesting, fetching water, etc., before the new soldiers depart. Villages are giving priority to cultivating the spring land for military families. In Ma Lao Village, the land of military families was completely cultivated in just three days, with manure already spread in the fields. As a result, the new soldiers are training with hundredfold intensity, eager to make contributions for the people. Many model peasants who turned over and received land in Yanggu are now becoming model land protectors, with over nine hundred people enlisting. The eldest son of Yan Jingfa, an old hero of the land reform in the Ninth District, joined the army last year. He has two more sons, and this time the three of them joined the army together. In Guancheng, based on the foundation of anti-Chiang support for the army and preferential treatment for resistance, an upsurge of enthusiasm for joining the army has been launched, with cadres and heroes taking the lead in enlisting. Honored veterans are returning to the front lines, and hired laborers and students are voluntarily joining the army. At the hero models conference in Fan County, more than three hundred heroes volunteered to sign up on the spot.
