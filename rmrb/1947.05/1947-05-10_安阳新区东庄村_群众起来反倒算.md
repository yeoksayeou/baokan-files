    The Masses Rise Up to Reverse the Settled Accounts
    [This newspaper, An'yang News] After our army liberated Dongzhuang Village in the Sixth District, the local bullies and landlords who had oppressed the masses during the period of the enemy and puppet regime actively moved to seize control of the village government, taking advantage of the fact that the masses were still afraid to speak out. They themselves appointed Zhao Chenglu, a target of struggle, as the chairman of the Farmers' Association, the bully landlord Zhao Xi as the village chief, and Zhao Yupei, a member of the Home-Returning Corps, as the head of the self-defense force, and had the masses approve it in a meeting. When democratic government sent cadres to the village, the Farmers' Association chairman and others appointed by the landlords pretended to be very active and told the cadres, "We will do whatever the higher authorities instruct." After the cadres conducted an in-depth investigation, the masses said, "They oppressed the people when the enemy was here, and they are still doing well after the Eighth Route Army came." The cadres immediately asked the masses, "They were our enemies in the past. Can they lead the poor people to turn over a new leaf?" The masses said, "A ghost can never become a human being." With the unanimous opposition of the masses, a mass meeting was immediately held to remove all the bad eggs appointed by the landlords from their posts. Groups were formed to discuss and elect cadres, such as the chairman of the Farmers' Association, who were truly loved by the masses and enthusiastic in helping the poor to turn over a new leaf. The movement to reverse the settled accounts immediately unfolded. (Shi Feng)

　　安阳新区东庄村
    群众起来反倒算
    【本报安阳讯】六区东庄村经我军解放后，在敌伪时期欺压群众的恶霸地主，趁群众还不敢说话，就积极活动，企图掌握村政权。他们自己指定斗争对象赵成禄为农会主席，恶霸地主赵喜的为村长，还乡团员赵玉佩为自卫队长，并叫群众开会通过。当民主政府派干部到该村时，这伙地主委派的农会主席等，都装腔作势的表示很积极，并对干部说：“上级指示啥，我们一切都干了”。经干部深入调查，随之群众都说：“他们敌人在时欺压人民，八路军来啦还吃得开。”干部即问群众：“过去是咱们敌人，能不能领导穷人翻身？”群众说：“鬼总不能变成人。”在群众一致反对下，立即召开群众大会，将地主指派的坏蛋一齐撤职，分组讨论，选出真正为群众爱戴热心帮助穷人翻身的农会主席等干部。反倒算运动马上开展起来。（石峰）
