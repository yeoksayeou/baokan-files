　　Women of Songshuping in Zuoquan
    Pull Seed Drills to Plant Over 100 Mu of Grain
    [Report from Zuoquan by this newspaper] In order to support the front lines and prepare for battle, Songshuping in the Third District decided to launch a crash-planting effort within five days, from the 4th to the 8th. Due to a shortage of livestock, strong women organized three seed-drill-pulling teams. In four days, eighteen women pulled seed drills to plant 120 mu of grain. Ma Fenghuang, the deputy village chief of Sai Di, and three other women planted 62.3 mu of grain in four days. Influenced by them, five women including Xia Lizizhi refused to plant seeds by hand and insisted on pulling seed drills. Calculating that one animal can plant 12 mu per day, 120 mu of grain saved ten animals. The masses all say: "The women are really something!"

    [Another report] According to statistics from Hama Tan and Xiuchi villages: 98 women are working in the fields, equivalent to 53 full male laborers. Wang Xiaoying, a military dependent from Hama Tan, originally received preferential treatment, but now not only does she not need preferential treatment, but she also helps other military dependents' mothers carry water. Influenced by this, women in Xiuchi have stopped weaving and started working in the fields, some carrying manure, some hoeing the edges of the fields, and some pulling plows. The masses have a new understanding of women's ability to work in the fields.

　　左权松树坪妇女
    拉耧种谷百余亩
    【本报左权讯】三区松树坪为了支援前线，准备参战，定四日到八日五天内突击下种。因为畜力缺乏，身体强壮的妇女组织了三个拉耧组，四天内十八个妇女拉耧种谷一百二十亩。赛底副村马凤黄等四个妇女四天内就种谷六十二亩三分。在她四人影响下，下李芝籽等五个妇女不愿点籽非要去拉耧不行。以一个牲口一天种十二亩计算，一百二十亩谷，省出十头牲口。群众都这样说：“妇女真不简单呀。”

    【又讯】据蛤蟆滩、休池两个村统计：上地妇女九十八人，能顶男全劳力五十三人。蛤蟆滩军属王小英原用优待，现在不但不用优待，反而帮助其他军属老娘担水。休池妇女在这一影响下已停止纺织，开始下地，有担粪的、有刨地边的，有拉耢的，群众对于妇女能上地劳动有了新的认识。
