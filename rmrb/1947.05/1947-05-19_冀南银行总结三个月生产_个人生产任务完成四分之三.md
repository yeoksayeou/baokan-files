　　Jinnan Bank Summarizes Three Months of Production
    Individual Production Tasks Completed Three-Quarters
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Jinnan Bank Head Office achieved significant results in three months of office production. Totals include: 1,600 catties of cotton carding, raising six large pigs, knitting ten sweaters, making 1,380 catties of tofu, making two shirts, three single-layer garments, one pair of shoes, and two pairs of shorts, etc., with a total income of 6,680 catties of millet, averaging 185 catties per person, accounting for 74 percent of the annual production task. Among them, Chen Guiying's group transported goods for two months and completely fulfilled the production task. Chen Yinggui carried 120 catties of weight each time, walking 90 li, eating only one steamed bun on the road, and living very hard. He not only completed his own task, but also, through labor exchange with Lian Delu, completed the leader's task.
    The following experiences were gained in the three months of production: 1. Office handicraft production must be combined with mass production; our cotton carding bow was established in this way. The textile industry in the stationed village is very active, and each adult woman has to spin 36 catties of cotton. The most difficult thing is cotton carding. The cooperative's two machines cannot card enough. Every time the masses go to the cooperative to card cotton, it takes ten days. Seeing the difficulties of the masses, we bought a machine, and even now the carded cotton is still piled up in a room. 2. Production should be combined with work. For example, the kitchen's production involves grinding tofu and raising pigs, and comrades on missions also do some transportation, etc. 3. Learn about handicraft tools before buying them. This time we bought a sock knitting machine, but as a result, we couldn't use it after buying it, so we had to sell it! And lose money! It cannot produce and occupies capital. 4. The production plan should be realistic and linked to increasing social wealth. The past plans were divorced from increasing social wealth. At present, the head office's production is still continuing. (Chen Qi)

　　冀南银行总结三个月生产
    个人生产任务完成四分之三
    【本报讯】冀南银行总行三个月的机关生产，获显著成绩；计共弹花一千六百斤，养大猪六口，织毛衣十件，做豆腐一千三百八十斤，做衬衣二件，单衣三件，鞋一双，裤叉二个等等，共收入小米六千六百八十斤，平均每人一百八十五斤，占全年生产任务百分之七十四。其中陈贵英组运输了两个月，全部完成了生产任务。陈英贵每次担一百二十斤重，走九十里地，路上只吃一个馍，生活非常艰苦，他不但完成了自己任务，而且和连得禄变工还完成了首长任务。
    三个月的生产中，获得以下几点经验：一、机关手工业生产要与群众生产结合；我们的弹花弓就是这样建立起来的。驻村的纺织很活跃，每个成年妇女要纺三十六斤花，最感困难的是弹花，合作社二辆车子弹不出来，每次群众去合作社弹一次花，要得十天工夫，我们看到了群众这样困难，就买了一辆车子，至今弹花仍是堆积一屋子。二、生产要与工作结合。如伙房的生产磨豆腐兼养猪，出发同志兼做些运输等。三、手工工具要学会再买。我们这次买了一架织袜子机，结果买来用不了，卖！又得赔钱！既不能生产又占资金。四、生产计划要切合现实，与增加社会财富联系起来，过去订的计划与增加社会财富脱节。目前总行生产仍在继续开展中。（陈琦）
