[Report from our Jinnan Office on the 19th] Farmers in Yuancheng, Ningnan, and other counties are actively building water conservancy projects to prevent drought and disasters. In April, 30,000 liberated farmers in Yuancheng County launched a surprise excavation of the Majia River, transforming 7,000 mu of marshland into fertile fields, which is expected to increase grain production by 360,000 jin. The farmers spontaneously started a competition craze. The masses in Zhang Village, Yuancheng, dug rivers at night, and the honored veterans of Zhanglu competed to make contributions. Students from Fanzhuang Elementary School in Jing County worked hard every night, going out before dawn. Each elementary school student excavated 20,000 jin of soil every day, completing the project ahead of schedule. The 23,000 farmers digging rivers on both sides of the North Sha River in Ningnan saved 81,200 jin of millet. The people praised the canal, saying, "This is truly a merit for all ages."
