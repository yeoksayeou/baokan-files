The Yang Shiying Flying Squad of the Anxia Independent Battalion
    Conducts Activities Deep in the Suburbs of Anyun City

    [This Newspaper Taiyue 3rd Dispatch] The Yang Shiying Flying Squad of the Anxia Independent Battalion has been conducting activities deep in the suburbs of Anyun City. In one month, they killed or captured 23 Chiang soldiers and seized more than 10 rifles, with no casualties on our side, creating a good example of small armed forces conducting activities deep behind enemy lines, accumulating small victories into a big victory. This small armed force was organized in February of this year under the influence of the surprise victory of the guerrilla detachment going to Sichuan. Their combat activities have the following characteristics: (1) They have truly grasped the contradiction of Chiang, Hu, and Yan bullying the small. Once, the squad was active in Han Wutong Village on the Anxia Highway and encountered six Yan stubborn "Love the Village Corps" members. Yang Shiying pretended to be a Chiang army officer and approached the Yan stubborns calmly, asking, "Which unit are you from? Why didn't you bring official documents when you came out? Are you up to no good?" The six stubborn soldiers were so frightened that they huddled together. They quickly took out their official documents. Yang Shiying took the documents and said, "Good, take their guns and prove it in the city." The stubborn soldiers were like drowned chickens when they were captured. (2) Flexible and calm. They often encounter large enemy units in their activities, but they do not fight recklessly, but wait for an opportunity to capture the enemy. Once, they went deep into the Yuncheng Airport to reconnoiter and saw a large enemy force concentrating south of Yuncheng. They quietly ambushed on the side and finally captured a straggling platoon leader. Another time, they met a Chiang army major officer. Yang Shiying was afraid that the enemy would see through their disguise, so he chatted and laughed with the common people. Taking advantage of his carelessness, they captured him alive. That day, they captured seven enemies alive in six different places. (3) Resolutely protect the interests of the people, maintain close military-civilian relations, and kill Chiang's army secret agents who harm the people. As long as the people report to him, he will definitely find a way to eliminate the harm for the people. In January, they captured seven secret agents and won the warm support of the masses in the Chiang-occupied area.

　　安夏独立营杨士英飞行小组
    深入安运城郊活动
    【本报太岳三日电】安夏独立营杨士英飞行小组深入安运城郊活动，一个月毙俘蒋军二十三名，缴获步枪十余支，我无伤亡，创造了短小武装深入敌后活动，集小胜为大胜的好榜样。这支小型武装，今年二月在赴川游击队出奇制胜的影响下组织起来，他们的战斗活动有以下几个特点：（一）确实掌握了蒋胡阎大欺小的矛盾。某次小组在安夏公路的韩五同村活动，遇见阎顽“爱乡团”六人，杨士英装出蒋军军官样子，不慌不忙接近阎顽发问道：“你们是那部份？出来怎么不带公事？不是干好事吧？”六个顽军吓成一堆，赶忙把公事拿出来，杨士英接住公事，又说：“好，把他们的枪收了，到城里再证明。”顽军像落水鸡似的当了俘虏。（二）机动沉着。他们活动常遇到敌人大队，但他们不乱打，而待机捉敌。有一次深入运城机场去侦察，见大队敌人由运城南下集中，他们静悄悄的伏在一边，最后捉住一个掉队的排长。又一次遇见蒋军一少校军官，杨士英怕敌人看出破绽，就和老百姓连说带笑的闲谈，乘不留意时，将其活捉。这天他们在六个不同地方，活捉敌人七名。（三）坚决保护人民利益，密切军民关系，杀害人民的蒋军特务，只要老百姓向他报告，他就一定生法为民除害。一月间，他们捉了七个特务，获得蒋占区群众热烈拥护。
