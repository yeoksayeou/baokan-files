　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th. A Xinhua News Agency reporter commented on the People's Liberation Army's battle achievements in February, March, and April, stating: Reviewing the People's Liberation Army's achievements in these three months, and comparing them with the previous seven months, one can see that Chiang's army is showing an increasingly serious crisis in the following aspects. (1) The scope of Chiang's regular army annihilated in each battle is expanding, and the resistance time is shortening. In the second half of last year, Chiang's army was rarely annihilated a brigade or more at a time; this year, the annihilation of several brigades at a time has occurred continuously. In January this year, the People's Liberation Army annihilated five enemy brigades in Lunan, taking more than ten days; in February, the annihilation of seven enemy brigades in Lunan took only sixty-odd hours; the final resolution of the battle only took five hours. Other battles, such as the Tonghua battle in Southern Manchuria and the Qixian battle in Northern Henan, were resolved very quickly. The Qinghuabian and Wayao Fort battles in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region were resolved in just two hours and eight hours respectively. (2) The proportion of captured Chiang's soldiers is increasing, and the number of Chiang's generals captured is also increasing. In the seven months from July last year to January this year, the People's Liberation Army captured 252,117 Chiang's regular soldiers, killed and wounded 214,305 Chiang's regular soldiers, with a ratio of only six to five; in the three months of February, March, and April this year, 137,794 Chiang's regular soldiers were captured, and 67,921 Chiang's regular soldiers were killed and wounded, with the ratio leaping to over two to one. In the annihilation battles during these three months, this ratio often reached four to one or even ten to one or more. In the seven months from July last year to January this year, eighty-six Chiang's generals were captured, including thirty-nine puppet army generals and forty-seven Chiang's regular army generals. In the three months of February, March, and April this year, fifty Chiang's generals were captured, and other than ten being puppet army generals, the rest were all Chiang's regular army generals. When Chiang's army was surrounded last year, there was an incident of Dai Zhiqi, commander of the 69th Division, committing suicide. This year, after Li Xianzhou, deputy commander of the Second Appeasement Zone of the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters, was captured, he soon took the lead in publishing a circular telegram against the civil war. The 89th Division, which had been the main force of Chiang Kai-shek's anti-communism since the Ten-Year Civil War era, was surrounded in Tonghua this time, and the officers ordered the troops to disarm in an orderly manner. It can be seen to what extent the war-weariness of Chiang's army has risen, and the morale and combat effectiveness have declined. (3) In the three months of February, March, and April, Chiang's army occupied 67 counties in the liberated areas, and the People's Liberation Army liberated 101. Chiang's army occupied 276 kilometers of railways and 38 stations in the liberated areas, while the People's Liberation Army liberated 1,020 kilometers of railways and 99 stations. The People's Liberation Army's strategy is not primarily based on the gains and losses of cities and railways, but the above-mentioned developments have occurred in these three months; this precisely shows that in the overall war situation, Chiang's army is increasingly falling into a passive position, and the People's Liberation Army is increasingly gaining the initiative.

### 解放军三个月战绩显示蒋军危机日益严重

　　解放军三个月战绩显示蒋军危机日益严重
    【新华社陕北二十日电】新华社记者评人民解放军二、三、四三个月战绩称：回顾人民解放军这三个月的战绩，并与前此七个月的战绩相比较，人们可以看出：蒋军在如下各方面显示日益严重的危机。（一）蒋正规军在每个战役中被歼的范围日益扩大；抵抗的时间日益缩短。在去年下半年，蒋军很少一次被歼一个旅以上；而在今年，则一次被歼几个旅的事连续发生。今年一月，人民解放军在鲁南歼敌五个旅，费时前后达十余日；至二月间鲁南歼敌七个旅，费时不过六十余小时；其最后解决战斗只费五小时。他如南满通化之战，豫北淇县之战，解决战斗均甚迅速。而陕甘宁边区青化砭与瓦窑堡之战，仅以二小时与八小时即解决战斗。（二）被歼蒋军俘虏所占的比重日益增高；蒋军将级军官被俘者也日益增多。人民解放军在去年七月至今年一月七个月中，俘虏蒋正规军为二十五万二千一百十七名，毙伤蒋正规军二十一万四千三百零五名，两者比率仅为六比五；而在今年二、三、四三个月中，俘虏蒋正规军十三万七千七百九十四人，毙伤蒋正规军六万七千九百二十一人，两者比率即一跃而超过二比一。至在这三个月各次歼灭战役中，此项比率则往往高至四比一以至十比一以上。在去年七月至今年一月七个月中，俘虏蒋军将级军官八十六名，内伪军将领占卅九名，蒋正规军将领占四十七名。而今年二、三、四三个月中，即俘虏蒋军将级军官五十名，内除十名为伪军将领外，余均为蒋正规军将领。在去年蒋军被围时，还出过六十九师师长戴之奇自杀这样一件事，而今年徐州绥署二绥区副司令李仙洲被俘后，不久即领衔发表反内战的通电。自十年内战时代即伪蒋介石反共主力的八十九师，此次在通化被围后，即由军官指挥军队缴械，秩序井然。可见蒋军厌战情绪高涨，与士气战力的低落是已经到了什么程度。（三）在二、三、四三个月中，蒋军侵占解放区县城六十七座，人民解放军解放了一百零一座。蒋军侵占解放区铁路二百七十六公里，车站卅八个，人民解放军则解放铁路一千零二十公里，车站九十九个。人民解放军的战略本不以城市铁路的得失为第一位，但是在这三个月中却得到上述的发展；这正是说明在整个战局中，蒋军已日益陷于被动，而人民解放军则日益取得了主动。
