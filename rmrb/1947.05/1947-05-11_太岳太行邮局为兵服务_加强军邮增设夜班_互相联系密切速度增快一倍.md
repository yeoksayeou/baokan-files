　　Taiyue Taihang Post Office Serves the Soldiers
    Strengthens Military Mail, Adds Night Shifts
    Close Mutual Contact, Speed Increased by One Time
    [This newspaper Taiyue News] In order to more powerfully support the front lines, defeat Chiang Kai-shek, defend the liberated areas, and defend Chairman Mao, the Administration has decided on the following measures for the postal service in the area: (1) Strengthen military mail. The 1st and 3rd military post stations will be changed to military post offices, and three additional military post stations will be established so that battlefield troops' newspapers, letters, and propaganda materials can be delivered in a timely manner. (2) Add night shifts. Starting from the 7th of this month, two night shifts will be added to the main line from Yangcheng to the Third Sub-district, so that day and night shifts can be closely combined, with people resting but mail not resting. In the past, this main line took five days, but now it only takes three days. Also, a night shift has been added to the main line from Yangcheng to Yicheng, which can speed up the journey by one day. (3) In order to cooperate with the victory in Southern Shanxi, liaison stations will be established in counties that may be recovered, and postal services will be opened immediately if the situation permits. (4) Postal workers' fast legs should be combined with the postal clerks' fast hands in receiving and sending mail, so as to avoid mutual influence. Mail should be delivered locally, striving to "finish today's work today," without backlog or shirk responsibility. (5) Postal workers should post good news and propaganda materials, and spread news of victory orally. (6) Strengthening the speed of the front line should be combined with the merit-making movement. Competitions should be launched to ensure that cadres and postal workers complete wartime tasks, and close contact between the front and rear is maintained. With the victorious advance of our army in Southern Shanxi, the area has entered a surge of merit-making movement. It is reported that the Yangcheng Bureau was the first to respond, with cadres taking the lead. Comrade Wei Gaofeng took the lead in running the night shift on the 7th of this month. Under his influence, seven comrades including Kong Xiangfu have also set off on night shifts. Subsequently, seven comrades including Li Zhenbang also signed up and promised to persist, ensuring that the mail is not lost, not misplaced, not incorrect, and on time return, increasing the weight of the load. On the 8th, the employees of the Qinshui Bureau also began to implement it. Postal worker Zhao Hongyuan said: "Everyone is happy and satisfied to defeat Chiang Kai-shek. The troops in the front are not afraid to die, so how can we be afraid of hardship?"

    [This newspaper Taihang News] The area is also vigorously carrying out work to support the front lines in conjunction with the ongoing Battle of Northern Henan. They put forward the central slogan of "serving the soldiers" and "delivering newspapers and letters to the front quickly." The District Bureau issued an order on April 4th, which stated briefly: "It is decided to implement a night shift system on the main lines of the Fourth and Fifth Sub-districts. With Yetao Bureau as the starting point, a night shift will be set up every other line. From Yetao to Bo'ai, it used to take seven days, but now it can be reached in three and a half days. It used to take four days to Linqi, but now it takes two days. The time has been accelerated by one time."
