　　Pay Attention to the Use and Care of Working Cattle
　　Aicang Village has eleven cattle in total, but only nine are usable. Those who use the livestock do not take care of them and are unwilling to invest money (feed) in them. Some people have the bad, mutually-supportive idea of just letting things slide to save effort. For example, Duan Zhenfu's cattle were used by Duan Jinshan to plow the fields. The cattle were already exhausted, but after plowing, they drank cold water from the pond on the way home, and died two days later from not eating grass. This is a great loss to the spring plowing effort. It is hoped that village cadres in all regions will pay attention to this.

　　注意使养耕牛
    艾仓村共有牛十一只，能用的只九只，使牲口的不将息牲口，不愿下本钱（料）喂牲口，在某些人思想上有着拉倒省的互助坏想法。如：段真福的牛给段金山犁地，本来牛乏了，犁罢地回家时，又在池上喝了冷水，回家二天不吃草就死了。这样对春耕损失很大，希各地区村干部注意。
