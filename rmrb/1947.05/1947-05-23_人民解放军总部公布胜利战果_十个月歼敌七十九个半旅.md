Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th. The Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army issued a communiqué on the self-defense achievements from July of last year to April of this year (ten months) and the three months of February, March, and April of this year, stating that from July of last year, when Chiang Kai-shek began the full-scale civil war, to April of this year, in these ten months, the strength of Chiang's regular army eliminated above the regiment level has reached 79 and a half brigades. In the three months of February, March, and April of this year, 23 and a half brigades (23 brigades and 7 battalions) of Chiang’s regular army were eliminated above the regiment level. This includes 14 complete brigades, namely the 15th Division, 77th Division, and 193rd Division of the 73rd Army (equivalent to a reorganized division, the same below), the 175th Brigade, 188th Brigade, and New 19th Brigade of the Reorganized 46th Division, the New 36th Division of the 12th Army, the 88th Division of the 71st Army, the 34th Brigade, New 13th Brigade, and New 15th Brigade of the Reorganized 72nd Division, the 89th Division of the 13th Army, the 135th Brigade of the Reorganized 15th Division, and the Second Rapid Column (i.e., the 49th Brigade) of the Reorganized 27th Division. The complete annihilation of the 73rd Army, the 46th Division, and the 72nd Division in succession in the Laiwu Campaign and the Tai'an Campaign in Central Shandong dealt a heavy blow to Chiang Kai-shek and created panic and confusion in Chiang Kai-shek's command organs. They regarded Shandong as a decisive battlefield with the People's Liberation Army. These three annihilated divisions were all elite divisions of Chiang Kai-shek: the 73rd Army was entirely American-equipped, a direct line main force of Chiang's army airlifted to Jinan; the 46th Division was the main force of the Guangxi clique of Chiang's army formerly under Li Pinxian; and the 72nd Division was the main force of the Sichuan clique of Chiang's army formerly under Wang Lingji. The annihilation of the elite 88th Division and 89th Division of Du Yuming's forces changed the balance of military power in the Northeast. The elimination of the Second Rapid Column in northern Henan, following the elimination of the First Rapid Column in southern Shandong, caused the Chiang army to completely lose confidence in the so-called rapid columns, and greatly weakened the position of the Chiang army in northern Henan. The annihilation of the 135th Brigade of Hu Zongnan's forces following the annihilation of the 31st Brigade marked a turning point in the war situation in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. These victories in February, March, and April prepared favorable conditions for new victories for the People's Liberation Army on the Shandong, Northeast, and Northern Shaanxi fronts in May. Other important victories in April occurred in southern and eastern Shanxi Province. The People's Liberation Army in southern Shanxi liberated 19 county towns in the southern section of the Datong-Pukou Railway in Shanxi and south of the Fen River, directly threatening Hu Zongnan on the west and south banks of the Yellow River. The People's Liberation Army in the Jin-Cha-Ji liberated the central section of the Zhengtai (Zhengding to Taiyuan) Railway and liberated Zhengding, thus completing the encirclement of Shijiazhuang and Taiyuan. The communiqué stated that in the operations in February, March, and April of this year, a total of 67,921 Chiang regular army soldiers were killed or wounded, 137,794 were captured, totaling 200,5715. In the ten months from July last year to April this year, a total of 282,226 Chiang regular army soldiers were killed or wounded, 389,911 were captured, and 4,393 defected. The total is 676,530. In addition, the People's Liberation Army also achieved great results in the battles against the puppet troops and local armies incorporated by Chiang Kai-shek. In the ten months from July last year to April this year, a total of 84,922 Chiang puppet troops and local army soldiers were killed or wounded, 137,944 were captured, and 11,581 defected. The total is 234,448, accounting for about two-fifths of all puppet troops and local armies. In the operations in February, March, and April of this year, a total of 23 regiments of puppet troops above the regiment level were annihilated, and the main puppet troops of Hao Pengju, Zhang Lanfeng, and Hou Ruyong were almost completely wiped out. Hao and Zhang were both captured alive. The communiqué stated that in the three months of February, March, and April, a total of 50 Chiang-level military officers of the Chiang regular army and Chiang puppet army were captured, and 2 were killed. In the ten months from July last year to April this year, a total of 136 Chiang-level military officers of the Chiang army were captured, and 14 were killed.

　　人民解放军总部公布胜利战果
    十个月歼敌七十九个半旅
    【新华社陕北二十日电】人民解放军总部发表去年七月至今年四月十个月，和今年二、三、四三个月自卫战绩的公报称：由去年七月蒋介石开始全国内战的月份，到今年四月十个月中，蒋正规军整营以上被歼灭的兵力，已达七十九个半旅。在今年二、三、四三个月中，蒋正规军整营以上被歼灭的有二十三个半旅（二十三个旅又七个营）。其中包括十四个整旅，即七十三军（等于整编师、下同）的十五师（等于整编旅、下同）七十七师和一九三师，整四十六师的一七五旅、一八八旅和新十九旅，十二军的新三十六师，七十一军的八十八师，整七十二师的三十四旅、新十三旅和新十五旅，十三军的八十九师，整十五师的一三五旅与整二十七师的第二快速纵队（即四十九旅）。七十三军、四十六师和七十二师三个整师，在鲁中莱芜战役和泰安战役中相继被歼，给了蒋介石沉重的打击，并在蒋介石指挥机关中造成恐慌和混乱。他们是把山东当作与人民解放军的决战场的。这三个被歼的师都是蒋介石的精锐师：七十三军是全部美械，空运济南的嫡系蒋军主力；四十六师是原李品仙所属桂系蒋军主力；七十二师是原王陵基所属的川系蒋军主力。杜聿明部精锐八十八师与八十九师的歼灭，改变了东北军事力量的对比。第二快速纵队在豫北继第一快速纵队在鲁南被消灭的结果，使蒋军对所谓快速纵队完全丧失信心，并使豫北蒋军地位大大削弱。胡宗南部一三五旅继三十一旅被歼，标志着陕甘宁边区战局的转折点。二、三、四三个月的这些胜利，为五月份山东、东北、陕北各线人民解放军的新胜利准备了良好的条件。四月份的其他重要胜利，发生于山西省南部和东部。晋南人民解放军解放了山西同蒲路南段和汾河以南的十九座县城，直接威胁着黄河西岸和南岸的胡宗南。晋察冀人民解放军解放了正太（正定至太原）铁路的中段，并解放了正定，从而完成了对石家庄和太原的包围。公报称：在今年二、三、四三个月作战中，蒋正规军共被毙伤六万七千九百二十一人，被俘十三万七千七百九十四人，合计二十万零五千七百十五名。在去年七月到今年四月十个月中，蒋正规军共被毙伤二十八万二千二百二十六人，被俘三十八万九千九百十一人，外投诚四千三百九十三人。总计六十七万六千五百三十人。此外，人民解放军在对蒋介石所收编的伪军与各地方军作战中，也得到了巨大的成绩。由去年七月到今年四月十个月中，蒋伪军与地方军共被毙伤八万四千九百二十二人，被俘十三万七千九百四十四人，外投诚一万一千五百八十一人。总计二十三万四千四百四十八人。约占全部伪军与地方军五分之二。在今年二、三、四三个月作战中，伪军整营以上被歼灭的合计二十三个团，主要的伪军郝鹏举、张岚峰、侯如墉等部，几已全部肃清。郝张二人都被生擒。公报称：在二、三、四三个月中，蒋正规军和蒋伪军蒋级军官共被俘五十名，被击毙二名。在去年七月到今年四月十个月中，蒋军蒋级军官共被俘一百三十六名，被击毙十四名。
