(This report from Taiyue, 6th of this month) Since the village cadre conference on the 20th of last month, Jin City's Sixth District has mobilized 2,870 women to participate in major agricultural labor, overcoming the labor shortage caused by the large-scale war effort, and completing spring planting ahead of schedule. The women of He Village, after returning from the fields on the first day, were all complaining about body aches. The Women's Rescue Chairman said, "Three days for the arms, two days for the legs, and you'll be fine after three days." Finally, all 57 women in the village were organized to ensure timely planting and prevent delays in farming. When Kou ＠Gou Village began mobilizing women to work, Li Guilian, the director of the Women's Rescue Association, carried manure for a whole day to show everyone, and the next day six group leaders went together, carrying a pit of manure in one and a half days. Many women came to see and said, "She is a cadre after all, truly capable." Guilian then went door-to-door to mobilize, and the women said, "We may be incapable, but we can try." On the third day, more than twenty women participated in carrying manure. Those who could carry, carried, and those who couldn't, carried with two people. The more they worked, the more energetic they became, and after two days they were all able to carry it alone, without needing two people. By the time of planting, thirty women had joined mutual aid teams. While the men planted, they cleaned up around the edges and pulled the livestock. The entire village completed the planting in eight days. They now put forward the slogan: "Men support the front, women guarantee clothing and food." Zhang Jiangshui, the production director of Qiaoxi Village, was worried when he saw that all the able-bodied men had gone to support the front lines. One day, while visiting relatives, he passed through He Village and Kou ＠Gou and saw that the women were all in the fields. He went to the village cadres to learn about the experience of mobilizing women. After the village cadres gave a detailed introduction, he didn't even go to his relatives' house, but went to his father-in-law's house to call his wife first. Along the way, he mobilized his wife, saying, "We have more than twenty mu of land to plant. Do you think I can do it alone? If you can't do heavy work, you can do light work!" His wife said she could. That night, Jiangshui went to persuade his aunt, who was over fifty years old. His aunt then mobilized four women, and they all went to the fields together the next day. Subsequently, the number of women participating in mutual aid teams reached seventy-three, all participating in major labor, and continuing to persist in mutual aid until the planting was completed. The village leadership's experience is to regularly commend models and post them on the blackboard newspaper. This method encouraged the women of eleven groups to continue carrying manure even at night. After being commended, the women of Beipo Village wanted to compete with the men in hoeing the fields. Military families in various villages are also competing in labor, with 935 mu of land declining assistance. Only one-third of the land of military, cadre, and martyr families in Beipo Village needs assistance. The widespread participation of women in agricultural labor has enabled the early completion of spring plowing in the entire district. According to incomplete statistics, women in the district carried a total of 5,641 loads of manure, hoed 1,130 mu of land, built ＠1,574 ridges, and hoed wheat on 6,879 mu.

    两千妇女上地劳动
    提早完成春耕下种
    【本报太岳六日电】晋城六区自上月二十日村干部大会后，已动员了二千八百七十名妇女参加农业主要劳动，克服了因大参战发生的劳力困难，提早完成了春耕下种。河村妇女第一天下地回来，个个叫着身上痛，妇救主席说：“三天胳膊两天腿，过三天就行了。”最后将全村五十七个妇女都组织起来，做到按时下种，不误农时。口＠沟村开始动员妇女劳动时，妇救会主任李桂莲独白担了一天粪叫大家看，第二天就有六个小组长一块去担，一天半担了一窖粪。许多妇女来参观，都说：“到底是干部，真能干。”桂莲接着挨门进行动员，妇女们说：“咱可是没出息，试试也可以。”第三天有二十几个妇女参加担粪，能担动的就担，担不动的就两个人抬，越干越有劲，两天后就都能担起来，没有人抬了。至下种时，有三十个妇女参加了互助组。男人下种，她们收拾＠边，拉牲口，全村八天即突击种完。她们现在提出口号：“男人支援前援，女人保证穿衣吃饭。”桥西村生产主任张江水看见全劳力支援前线去了，有些发愁。某日走亲戚路过河村、口＠沟，看见妇女都下了地，便找到该村干部请教动员妇女的经验。村干部详细介绍之后，他连亲戚家也不去了，先去他岳父家叫他女人。一路上他动员女人说：“咱种二十多亩地，你看光靠我一个人能行不行？你不能做重活可以做轻活！”女人表示可以。这天黑夜，江水又去说服了他五十多岁的婶母，他婶母又去动员了四个妇女，第二天一齐下地。接着，陆续参加互助组的妇女达到七十三名，均参加主要劳动，直至下种完毕，仍坚持互助。该村领导经验是经常表扬模范，登黑板报。这方式曾鼓舞十一个组的妇女在黑夜也继续担粪。北坡村妇女经过表扬，要与男人比赛锄地。各村军属亦在竞赛劳动，有九百三十五亩地谢绝了代耕。北坡全村军、干、烈属仅需代耕三分之一。妇女们广泛参加农业劳动，使全区春耕得以提早完成。据不完全统计，全区妇女在春耕中共担粪五千六百四十一担，锄地一千一百三十亩，垒＠一千五百七十四条，锄麦六千八百七十九亩。
