[This article is transmitted by the Taiyue branch.] The Taiyue region is universally combining support for the front lines with production campaigns. Mutual aid teams in various villages have created many good methods for integrating participation in the war effort with production: The Zhangxun Village mutual aid team in Yangcheng has stipulated three measures: (1) A civilian laborer participating in the war effort gets credited with one and a half days of work for each day of absence. (2) Those who do not wish to have work credited can return the labor. (3) Those who do not return the labor will be paid wages, ensuring that support for the front lines and production are not delayed. In 24 days, the village organized 22 teams, and all millet and cotton have been sown, saving 1,200 workdays. The Donghengling Village mutual aid team's method of supporting military families is: (1) Military dependents without labor receive free substitute farming of three mu per person, with the remainder being paid at low wages. (2) Military dependents with labor who participate in mutual aid teams receive an additional three sheng of millet on top of their own work credit. The method of mutual aid for civilian laborers participating in the war is: (1) Militiamen and civilian laborers participating in the war receive an extra two fen of work credit each day. (2) The mutual aid team is responsible for providing coal and water for the families of those participating in the war. The Shancun mutual aid team has created two types of work vouchers: one is a labor voucher, which is issued and received by the construction director, with one work unit equaling ten fen; the other is a war participation voucher, which is issued and received by the logistics director, with one work unit equaling twelve fen. This time, 15 people from the village participated in the war, which not only did not delay production, but also further consolidated the mutual aid team. The Zhongcun Village mutual aid team in Gaoping differentiates members when giving preferential treatment to military dependents and civilian laborers participating in the war, stipulating four measures: (1) If a military dependent is a middle peasant or rich peasant and has draft animals, their draft animals will not be used to plow land for others, and their draft animals will not receive preferential treatment from others. (2) If a military dependent is a middle peasant without livestock, each household will first receive preferential plowing of three xiang of land, with the remainder to be discussed separately. Food and fodder will be provided for both people and animals during the plowing time. (3) If a military dependent is a newly turned-over middle peasant, food will be provided for plowing, but not fodder. (4) Military dependents who are poor and have no people or animals will receive full preferential treatment. Military dependents are very satisfied with this method, so both full and semi-labor force members have joined the mutual aid team. On average, each household provides substitute farming of about three mu, with the remainder being farmed by themselves. Wangzhuang Village has also adopted the same method, not only completing the cultivation of all land belonging to military families, cadres, and martyrs, but also competing to complete the land of civilian laborers participating in the war. Xucun Village in Tunliu organized a military support evaluation committee to evaluate four types of military support measures for the entire village: (1) Those who have no people or animals, or who have animals but no people, and who are experiencing difficult living conditions, will receive full preferential treatment without compensation. There are a total of 13 households and 138.8 mu of land in this category in the village. (2) Those who have people but no animals, or who have animals but no people, and who have a better life, will receive half preferential treatment and pay half wages. There are a total of five households and 116 mu of land in this category in the village. (3) Those who have few people and a lot of land, lack draft animals, and have a relatively wealthy life, will receive low-price preferential treatment. There are a total of sixteen households and 408 mu of land in this category in the village. (4) Those who have both people and animals will not receive preferential treatment. There are a total of thirteen households and 453 mu of land in the whole village. In total, 140 laborers and 47 draft animals in the village participated in substitute farming, with each laborer providing an average of two work units and one xiang of military support, and draft animals providing two work units and four xiang. According to this standard, military dependents and various mutual aid teams voluntarily combine to provide preferential treatment through household contracts and contract labor, which is extremely satisfying to military dependents. The land is cultivated meticulously, and the mutual aid team saves 100 work units compared to previous years in providing military support.

　　吸收军属全半劳力参加生产
    太岳精确组织代耕
    【本报太岳一日电】太岳全区支援前线与生产运动普遍结合，各村互助组创造了不少参战与生产结合的好办法：阳城章训村互助组规定三项办法：（一）参战民夫出去一天顶工一天半。（二）如不愿顶差者可还工。（三）不还工者付工资，使支援前线与生产两不耽误，该村廿四天中即组织起二十二个小组，谷子、棉花已全部下种，并省工一千二百个。东横岭村互助组优军的办法是：（一）无劳力的军属，按其人口每人无代价代耕三亩，余付低价工资。（二）军属有劳力参加互助组者，除本人顶工外，并外得三升小米。给参战民夫互助的办法是：（一）参战民兵与民夫每日多顶工二分。（二）参战人员的家庭烧煤吃水全由互助组负责。山村互助组制定两种工票：一种是劳动工票，由建设主任负责收发，一工顶十分；一种是参战工票，由后勤主任负责收发，一工顶十二分。此次该村参战走了十五人，不仅未误生产，并使互助组更加巩固。高平中村互助组划分成份优待军属及参战民夫，规定了四项办法：（一）军属如系中农或富农成份者且有耕畜者，其耕畜不给别人犁地，别人耕畜亦不优待他。（二）军属如系中农而无牲畜者，每户先优待犁地三晌，余地另议。在犁地时间人畜饭料皆管。（三）军属如系新翻身的中农，犁地管饭不管料。（四）军属如系贫苦且无人畜者全部优待。此种办法军属都很满意，因此全半劳力皆参加了互助组。一般每户约代耕三亩，余皆自耕。王庄村亦采取同样办法，不仅将全村军、干、烈属土地耕种完毕，并争先完成了参战民夫的土地。屯留许村组织了优军评议委员会，评定全村四种优军办法：（一）人畜全无，或有畜无人，而生活困难者，全部无代价优待。此类军属全村共有十三户，一百三十八亩八分土地。（二）有人无畜或有畜无人生活较好者，优待一半，付工资一半，此类军属全村共有五户，一百一十六亩土地。（三）人少地多耕畜缺乏，而生活较富裕者，低价优待，此类军属全村共有十六户，四百零八亩土地。（四）人畜全有者不予优待。全村共有十三户，四百五十三亩土地。总计全村参加代耕的一百四十个劳力，四十七头畜力，平均每个劳力优军两工零一晌，畜力二工零四晌。按此标准，军属与各互助组自愿结合，采取包户包工进行优待，军属对此异常满意，土地均精耕细作，互助组优军较往年省工一百个。
