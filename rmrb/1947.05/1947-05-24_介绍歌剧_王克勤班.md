Introducing the Opera "Wang Keqin Class"
　　Chen Feiqin

　　The opera "Wang Keqin Class," collectively created by the Military Region Cultural Troupe and the Sixth Cultural Work Team, was performed eighteen times on the front lines of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Military Region. It received widespread welcome and praise. However, there were few comments from the perspective of entertainment or acting skills. Most comments came from the perspective of the actual living conditions of the troops and the significance of educating the troops.

　　If the Wang Keqin movement marks the deepening of the army's political work to the most basic level of the troops – the class, then the opera "Wang Keqin Class," which reflects the Wang Keqin movement, plays a universal educational role for the troops. If Wang Keqin is a model of mutual assistance, bravery combined with skill, and being good at leading new recruits in combat, then the opera "Wang Keqin Class," which reflects the Wang Keqin model, has broad educational significance for the troops in various aspects of work – from receiving new recruits, marching, training, combat, educating new recruits with skills and leading them, mutual assistance in various situations, solving ideological and life problems of soldiers, loving work, to summarizing battles, and electing heroes.

　　Precisely because of this, many companies and platoons held discussions after watching "Wang Keqin Class," and all such discussions were closely linked to their own reality. In the records of these discussions, we can see:

　　1. It helped the troops discover that there were also some aspects in their own units that were like the "Wang Keqin Class," encouraging them to cultivate their own Wang Keqin.

　　2. Squad leaders used Wang Keqin as a standard to examine themselves, determined to learn from Wang Keqin. For example, after the first company of a certain regiment watched "Wang Keqin Class," the company held a squad leader symposium, mainly to reflect and learn Wang Keqin's good style. A squad leader named Jing Shirong said: "We don't explain anything when we do things, we always just say, 'Quick! Do it quickly!' or 'Keep up! Follow closely!' That's it. We don't explain the problem like Wang Keqin explained to Bai Zhixue." After everyone's research, they felt that it was necessary to first communicate ideas before doing anything. After watching the play, the Fourth and Fifth Troops vigorously launched the Wang Keqin movement in conjunction with "sharpening the knife" and "training soldiers." After watching the play, the ninth squad of the seventh company and the eighth squad of the second team of the troops automatically held a squad meeting to conduct self-examination and reflection. Ren Wu, the squad leader of the eighth squad, said: "I was liberated by the Eighth Route Army, and soon the superiors asked me to be the deputy squad leader and squad leader. The superiors care about me so much, but I still have that set of warlordism from the Chiang army, and my attitude towards comrades is not good. When I saw that Wang Keqin was also liberated, and he treated the soldiers like his own brothers, I decided to learn Wang Keqin's method of leading troops, and we will create a second Wang Keqin Class."

　　3. Mutual aid group leaders used the mutual aid group of the Wang Keqin Class to examine their own mutual aid group. For example, the squad leader symposium of the first company mentioned above researched that their own company's mutual aid group had shortcomings (such as the mutual aid group leader being concurrently held by the squad leader, deputy squad leader, and group leader). They felt that Wang Keqin's method was good – the soldiers themselves find mutual aid partners and democratically elect the mutual aid group leader. Therefore, according to everyone's opinions, they prepared to re-establish the mutual aid group. After watching the play, the soldiers and squad leaders of the Fourth and Fifth Troops further recognized the true role of the mutual aid group. An old Kong, the leader of a mutual aid group of the eighth squad, said: "The mutual aid group of the Wang Keqin Class is really well organized. Their mutual aid group leaders care about the soldiers so much, we are far behind them! I plan to learn the mutual aid song first, and then learn from the mutual aid group leader in the play."

　　4. Liberated soldiers saw their way out in the People's Liberation Army from Wang Keqin, and saw reliance in the People's Liberation Army from mutual assistance and friendship. For example, after watching "Wang Keqin Class," the liberated soldiers of the 21st Brigade felt that there were really people like Wang Keqin in the People's Liberation Army, who were respected by everyone. They felt that the Eighth Route Army was friendly and helped each other, caring and helping each other in everything, like family, fathers, sons, and brothers. The squad leader was like the head of the family, taking care of everything, unlike the Chiang army, where everyone took care of themselves, had no support, and only relied on saving a few dollars to find a way to treat themselves when they were sick, and if they couldn't, they had a few travel expenses to desert and go home."

　　5. New recruits examined themselves with Bai Zhixue as an example, wanting to learn from him how to transition from peasant life to get used to army life, from fear to fearlessness, and striving to be a hero. For example, at the eighth squad meeting mentioned above, the new recruit Erniu said: "Bai Zhixue in the play is just like when I first came, this play is really well acted, it has grasped the hearts of the new recruits! When I joined the army at home, I also swore at the conference: "I will not go home until I defeat Chiang Kai-shek." However, this one night march pulled me down! I can't stand this hardship, so I had the idea of going home. Later, I thought it was wrong to go home, Chiang Kai-shek has not been defeated, it is too embarrassing to go back... Bai Zhixue later changed and strived to become a hero and wear a red flower, I will also work hard to learn from Bai Zhixue and strive to become a hero and wear a red flower."

　　6. Old soldiers examined themselves with Zhao Qingnian as an example, wanting to learn from him how to help new recruits politically and militarily, and organize mutual assistance.

　　In this way, their discussion meetings became meetings for strictly examining themselves, humbly learning from others, uniting and progressing, and became meetings for studying how to improve themselves politically and militarily. After the self-examination, they immediately proposed competitions and made plans. For example, at the discussion meeting of the ninth squad of the seventh company of the Fourth and Fifth Troops, Guo Wu, the leader of one mutual aid group, proposed a competition to the second group, and made a learning plan for his group:

　　(1) Su Shun of the second group has poor movements, I will first teach him;
　　(2) Now the average throwing distance of each person in the whole group is 20 meters, and during the training, it must reach an average of 30 meters per person;
　　(3) The shooting posture must be good, and accurate shooting must be achieved;
　　(4) Ensure that everyone is proficient in their own weapons.

　　The second group immediately responded to the challenge, proposing to reach a throwing distance of 35 meters, and to master the field movements in three days, so that everyone could lunge forward, and requiring the whole group to be proficient.

　　The above is to observe "Wang Keqin Class" from its content and practical significance. From the perspective of form, because it adopts the form of a military opera that can express the troops' combat enthusiasm and the enthusiasm for winning victory, it strongly strengthens the role of its content. The whole process of the matter, in the atmosphere of opera, expresses the active life and combat enthusiasm, bravery, wit, and the joy of victory of the People's Liberation Army. Many of the songs, such as "Welcome New Recruits," "Mutual Aid Song," "Departure to Battle," and "Training," have been widely spread to the troops and integrated into their lives, because they have found what they want to sing about in their troops' various activities. These songs are a praise of their struggle life, an encouragement to morale, and a teaching of work and struggle.

　　For many years, the rich and vivid struggle content and new heroism of our People's Liberation Army have urgently demanded the creation of a form suitable for it to express it. Now, the drama workers and music workers who have been trained in our troops for many years have begun to create it. They have inherited the advantages of Chinese old opera, especially folk opera, and created new military operas from the actual life of the troops. This kind of military opera has begun to have a strong impact in the troops, causing the soldiers to turn away from "Beijing Opera" and "High Pitches" (all of which only seek to satisfy entertainment desires, lose the expression of the new posture, new struggle life, and ideological content of the People's Liberation Army. These things in essence always teach people with the thoughts of the feudal rulers and the lifestyle of the old era.) and tend towards this new artistic creation.

　　The opera "Wang Keqin Class" has shortcomings. I think:

　　First, given the direct and urgent burden of transforming and training new liberated soldiers on the combat troops, how the various soldiers in a class should be equipped, the changes and characteristics of the various components of the Wang Keqin Class in the process of development, the work of the Party in a class, etc., all need to be further investigated and studied to strengthen its practicality and practical educational role;

　　Second, the portrayal of the characters in the troops and the embodiment of the life of the troops are not deep enough;

　　Third, the lyrics and dialogues are not soldier-like enough.

　　But these can be improved, and the Cultural Troupe is working hard to improve them. I believe that as long as we can further go deep into the company to experience life, be willing to humbly learn from the soldiers in the class, and after multiple performances, gather everyone's opinions and improve them, "Wang Keqin Class" will definitely become a successful new type of military opera.

　　介绍歌剧“王克勤班”
    陈斐琴
    军区文工团和第六文工队集体创作的歌剧《王克勤班》，在冀鲁豫前线部队上演了十八次，受到普遍的欢迎和好评，但很少听到从娱乐，从演技方面的评论，普遍地听到的是从部队实际生活状况，从教育部队的意义上发出来的评论。
    如果说王克勤运动是标志着人民军队的军政工作深入到部队的最基层——班，那么反映王克勤运动的歌剧《王克勤班》，就起了对部队普遍的教育作用；如果说王克勤是互助友爱，勇敢与技术结合，善于带领新战士作战等的典型，那么反映王克勤典礼的歌剧《王克勤班》，就对部队在各种方面工作——从接收新战士、行军、练兵、作战，教育新兵以技术和带领新战士，各种情况下的互助，解决战士思想与生活上的问题，拥爱工作以至总结战斗，选举英雄等——有广泛的教育意义。
    正因为如此，许多连队和班排看过了《王克勤班》之后，都进行讨论，所有这样的讨论会都是和自己的实际密切结合起来的。在这些讨论会的纪录中，我们可以看出：
    一、它帮助该部队发现本部队也有某些方面像《王克勤班》那样的班，鼓励了他们也去培养出自己的王克勤来。
    二、班长以王克勤作标准来检讨自己，决心要学王克勤，如×团一连看了《王克勤班》之后，连里就召开了一个班长座谈会，主要是进行反省，学习王克勤的好作风，一个班长荆世荣说：“我们干什么事情都不会解释，总是快！快干！或是跟上！紧跟上！就算了，没有像王克勤给白志学讲道理一样的去解释问题。”经大家研究，认为干什么事尽先打通思想是应该的。四五部队观剧后，结合着“磨刀”“练兵”轰轰烈烈的展开了王克勤运动。该部队七连九班、二小队八班观剧后，回去就自动开了个班务会，进行检讨与反省。八班班长任五说：“我被八路军解放过来，不久上级就叫我当副班长、班长，上级对我这样关心，但我还是蒋军那一套军阀主义，对同志态度不好。一看人家王克勤也是解放过来的，对战士比亲兄弟都亲，我决心学习王克勤的带兵办法，咱们也创造一个第二个王克勤班。”
    三、互助组长以王克勤班的互助小组来检讨自己的互助小组；如上述一连班长座谈会上研究出自己连里的互助组有缺点（如互助组长都是由班长、副班长、小组长兼任）觉得王克勤的办法好——由战士自己找互助对象，民主选出互助小组长，于是根据大家的意见，准备重新建立互助组。观剧后，四五部队战士班长都进一步认识互助组的真正作用。八班的一个互助组组长老孔说：“王克勤班的互助组搞得真好，人家那互助组长多关心战士，咱比人家可差得远哩！我订计划要先把那个互助歌学会，再学习戏上那个互组组长。”
    四、解放战士从王克勤看到自己在人民解放军找着了出路，从互助友爱看到在人民解放军里有依靠；如二十一旅的解放战士看了《王克勤班》后，感到人民解放军真有王克勤这样的人，受到大家的尊敬，感到八路军友爱互助，遇事都互相关心帮助，像家人父子兄弟一样，班长就像当家人，事事都照顾到，不像蒋军各顾各，无依无靠，只靠自己弄几个钱好在有病时自己想法治一治，没法时有几个盘川开小差回家。”
    五、新战士以白志学来检讨自己，要学习他从农民生活转到习惯部队生活，从恐惧走向无畏，发奋当一个英雄；如上述八班班务会上，新战士二牛说：“戏上的白志学就和我刚来时一样，这戏演得真好，都摸准新战士的心啦！我在家参军时也是在大会上宣誓：“不打败蒋介石就不回家。”可是，这里一个夜行军就把我拉垮啦！吃不得这苦，就起了回家思想，后来又想回家不对，蒋介石没有打败，回去太丢人……白志学后来转变了，还争取当了英雄，带上红花，我也要努力学习白志学，争取当英雄带红花。
    六、老战士以赵青年来检讨自己，要学习他在政治上、军事上帮助新战士，组织互助。
    这样，他们的讨论会，就成为严格检讨自己，虑心学习别人，团结进步的会，成为研究如何在政治上军事上提高自己的会，并且在检讨之后，立即提出比赛，订计划，如四五部队七连九班讨论会上，一组互助组长郭五一提议向二组提出比赛，并订出本组学习计划：
    （一）二组苏顺动作差，我首先把他教会；
    （二）现在全组平均每人投弹二十米达，整训中要达到平均每人投到三十米达；
    （三）射击姿势要好，还要达到准确射击；
    （四）保证每人要熟练自己的武器。
    二组马上应战，提出投弹要达到三十五米，三天内把野外动作突击会，做到个个跃进，要求全组都要熟练。
    以上是从他的内容和实际意义来观察《王克勤班》。从形式上来看，因为他采取的是能表达部队战斗热情与争取胜利的热情的部队歌剧形式，就使它强烈地加强其内容的作用。全部事情的过程在歌剧的气氛中，表达出人民解放军活跃的生活与战斗的热情，勇敢、机智与胜利的欢腾，其中许多歌曲，如“欢迎新战士”“互助歌”“出发作战”“练兵”等已经广泛的传播到部队里，和他们的生活融合着，因为他们找到了他们部队各种活动中他们所要歌唱的。这些歌子对他们是斗争生活的颂扬，是士气的鼓励，又是工作与斗争的教导。
    好多年来，我们人民解放军丰富的生动的斗争内容与新英雄主义，已经迫切地要求创造出适合于它的形式来表现它了。现在，我们部队里多年锻炼出来的戏剧工作者与音乐工作者，已开始创造它，他们继承了中国旧歌剧，尤其是民间歌剧的优点，从部队的实际生活出发，创造了新的部队歌剧，而这种部队歌剧，已经开始在部队里发生强烈的影响，使战士们从“京戏”“高调”等等（所有只求满足娱乐欲望，失掉表现人民解放军的新姿态，新的斗争生活与思想内容的戏剧，这些东西实质上总是常常以封建统治者的思想与旧时代的生活方式来教导人们。）扭过头来，倾向于这新的艺术创造了。
    歌剧《王克勤班》是有缺点的。我以为：
    第一，它对改造新解放战士和训练新战士的工作直接急迫的负担在战斗部队身上的情况下，一个班内各种战士应如何的配备，王克勤班在发展过程中各种成分配备的变化与特点，党在一个班里的工作等等，都还需要进一步去调查研究，以加强其实际性和实际教育作用；
    第二，它对部队人物的刻画和部队生活的体现，还是不够深刻的；
    第三，唱词与对话还不够士兵化。
    但这些都是可以改进的，而且文工团已在努力改进了，我相信只要能更进一步深入连队去体验生活，肯下到班里去虚心向战士学习，并经过多次的出演，将大家的意见汇集起来加以改进，《王克勤班》一定可以成为一个成功的新式的部队歌剧。
