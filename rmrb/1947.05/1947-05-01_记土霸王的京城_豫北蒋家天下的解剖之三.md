　　A Record of the Earth Emperor's Capital
    An Anatomical Analysis of the Jiang Family's Reign in Northern Henan, Part 3
    Li Pu
    The current official title of the local tyrant Hu Quanlu is the so-called Commander of the 4th Regiment of the Hebei Third Special District People's Training Corps. Yang Xiaotun is his capital, located twelve li northwest of the Junxian Railway Station on the Pinghan Railway.
    From a distance, I could see the tall, circular outer walls and the even more towering square blockhouses, which reminded me of the castles of ancient feudal lords in history textbooks.
    The arched gatehouse had two rooms, and two stone bridges were built over the moat, all engraved with three large red characters. The one on the right was called "Revival Bridge," and the one on the left was called "National Bridge." The gatehouse was engraved with "Nation Building Gate," and these three characters were especially large. The moat was more than ten feet deep, but not filled with water.
    Walking under the gate tower, I found that there were even more patterns above the three characters "Nation Building Gate." Let us look down in order from the top. At the top are the two characters "Defend," in the middle is "Wisdom, Benevolence, and Courage," on the right is "Pay Attention to Etiquette," and on the left is "Maintain Appearance." All of these were painted red on horizontally engraved stones.
    My feelings are complicated. When I saw the city walls and blockhouses, I thought of the ancient feudal lords. When I saw the two stone bridges acting as attendants, I thought of the Forbidden City in Beijing. When I saw those words, I thought of Chiang Kai-shek. And Hu Quanlu once lived inside here. The relationship between these four is truly mysterious. I suddenly discovered that my interest and curiosity were so strong, just like when I first visited the Forbidden City in Beijing.
    On the inner wall of the gate tower, on both sides were large slogans with six characters each, "Be Responsible and Obey Discipline." This is also Chiang Kai-shek's mantra. Walking inside, there were two more large slogans on the walls on both sides. On the left was "The rise and fall of the nation is the responsibility of soldiers; the failure to eliminate bandits is the shame of soldiers." Isn't this the first sentence in the preface to Chiang Kai-shek's personally ordered bandit suppression handbook? Looking at the right side, it says: "Support our Chairman Chiang in building a new China." Look how intimate! All of this clearly illustrates a fact: this local tyrant is wholeheartedly learning from the Heavenly King Chiang, supporting the Heavenly King Chiang, in order to be a small feudal lord under his command.
    I turned around and found that on the inside of the gate tower, in the place equivalent to the three characters "Nation Building Gate" on the outside, there were also three characters: "Spirit, Energy, and Vigor." Truly full of local flavor!
    I walked a circle along the road inside the city wall, wanting to see what other patterns there were. There were quite a few slogans, but I didn't want to copy them down because they were all Chiang Kai-shek's set. In addition to the gate tower, there were as many as seven large blockhouses, although the entire city wall was only about three li long. According to the old people who participated in the construction, the height of the city wall was thirty feet, and the blockhouses were forty feet. Most interestingly, I also discovered that each blockhouse had a name. They were: "Martial Virtue Tower," "Filial Piety Tower," "Integrity Tower," "Benevolence Tower," "Courtesy Tower," "Loyalty Tower," and "Physical Fitness Tower."
    I came on the morning of April 8th. Hu Quanlu had only escaped from here with his remnant troops the night before. At this time, many old people had come to collect grain, some from forty or fifty li away. For several years, every time the Liberation Army opened a place, they would distribute relief grain. The old people already knew this rule. The Liberation Army had not originally planned to distribute it on this day. They had just opened a place, and there were so many things to do. But since they had already come, they couldn't let them run back empty-handed, especially since these grains had originally been collected from them. This was the Liberation Army's responsibility. It was the same in Pangcun yesterday. In two days and two places, about 200,000 catties or more were distributed.
    In this capital, besides Hu Quanlu and his subordinates, there were also sixty or seventy households. Many men were tearing down the city walls, which used a lot of wood and sorghum stalks. The old people were worried about not having firewood to burn, because firewood was also among the things Hu Quanlu and his men had plundered. From these old, weak, women, and children collecting grain and the men tearing down the city, I learned that this village used to be larger than it is now, and the population was also larger. In order to build the city walls and dig that moat, Hu Quanlu forcibly demolished two streets on the southwest side, seventy-six rooms in total, belonging to eighteen households. That was in the spring of the thirty-fourth year [of the Republic, i.e. 1945], when the Japanese devils were still around. Those slogans and pictures were written later, and the words outside the door were also added later. In the Lunar New Year, Hu Quanlu announced that several families should start demolishing themselves on the thirteenth day of the first month [of the Lunar calendar], which was considered as saving some firewood. A middle-aged man named Hu Ying told me: "I was late to the fifteenth [of the month] and didn't start, thinking about where to live after it was demolished. Unexpectedly, two soldiers came that morning and asked, 'Are you going to demolish it or not?' I hadn't even had time to eat the pot of rice I had cooked before they drove me out, and they demolished the beams and pillars, leaving not even a single piece of firewood." Hu Ying is now squeezed in with his brother's family, and several other households have gone to other places to escape the famine.
    The project lasted for three or four months, which was during the busy farming season, so the crops were all delayed. A landlord named Yang Bin told me: "I originally had one qing of land, but these things made me poor that year." He pointed to the city walls and blockhouses and said. If a landlord with one qing of land was impoverished, what about the poor people? They only had one way to die. A middle-aged man named Shen Mingde told me that his uncle was forced to death at that time.
    The people tearing down the city were putting down their shovels to rest. Yang Bin said: "Now it's really clear. These past two days, no one has come looking for things, and the shovels are safely placed here. For the past few years, three hundred and sixty days a year, there wasn't a day when someone didn't come asking for something. Today they want this, tomorrow they want that, and you couldn't even keep a shovel!"
    I watched from afar as those old and young people collecting grain returned fully loaded, the spring sun shining on them. This is an extraordinary spring, truly beautiful and moving!

　　记土霸王的京城
    豫北蒋家天下的解剖之三
    李普
    土霸王扈全禄现在的正统名义是所谓河北第三专区民众集训总队第四团团长，杨小屯是他的京城，在平汉路浚县车站西北十二华里的地方。
    远远地我就看见那高大的圆形外墙，和几座更为高耸的四方炮楼，使我想起历史教科书上古代封建诸侯的城堡。
    拱形的大寨门两房，在护城河上架了两座石桥，都刻着三个红色的大字，右边的叫“复兴桥”，左边的叫“民族桥”，大寨门上刻着“建国门”，这三个字特别大。护城河有一丈多深，但未灌通。
    走到城门楼子底下，原来在“建国门”三字上面，别的花样还多着哩。让我们从顶上顺次看下来，顶上是“捍卫”两个字，当中是“智仁勇”，右边是“注意礼节”，左边是“整肃仪容”。都是在横刻石头上涂红了的。
    我的感想很复杂。看见城墙和炮楼的时候，想起古代的诸侯，看见那两座做配相的石桥的时候，想起北平的故宫，看见那些文字的时候，又想起蒋介石。而扈全禄曾经就住在这里面，这四者之中的关系真是奥妙得很啊。我突然发现我的兴趣和好奇心如此之强烈，就好像初次到北平参观故宫的时候一样。
    城门楼子的内墙上两边写着六个字的大标语，是“负责任守纪律”，这也是蒋介石的符咒，走到里面，两边墙上又是两幅大标语，左边是“国家兴亡军人之责，匪盗不除军人之耻”。这不是蒋介石手订的剿匪手本序言里的第一句话吗？再看右边，是：“拥护我们的蒋主席建设新中国”。你看，多么亲热！这一切清楚地说明着一个事实，这个土霸王是在一心一意学习着蒋天子，拥戴着蒋天子，以便在他手下做一个小诸侯。
    我回过头来，发现城门楼子的内面，相当于外面“建国门”三个字的地方，也有三个字，是：“精气神”。真是土气十足！
    我沿着城墙里面的大路走了一个圈子，想看看还有什么花样，标语很不少，但是我不想抄录了，因为都是蒋介石的那一套。除城门楼之外，大形的炮楼一共有七座之多，虽然这个城墙全程仅有三里路左右。据参加修建的老百姓说：城墙的高度是三丈，炮楼是四丈。最有趣的是我又发现原来每一座炮楼都有一个名字，他们是：“武德楼”，“孝悌楼”，“廉耻楼”，“仁爱楼”，“礼义楼”，“忠勇楼”，“强身楼”。
    我是四月八号上午来的，先一天晚上扈全禄才率残部从这儿逃出去。这时候已有许多老百姓来领粮了，有的是从四五十里以外跑来的，几年来解放军每打开一个地方总要发放救济粮，老百姓已经知道了这个规律。解放军本来没有准备在这一天散发，刚刚打开一个地方，有多么多的事情要做。可是既然已经来了，不能让他们空跑一趟，何况这些粮食本来就都是从他们身上搜刮来的，这是解放军的责任。昨天在庞村也是这样，两天两地约共发了廿万斤以上。
    这个京城里面除了扈全禄和他的部属之外，还住了六七十户人家，许多男人正在破城墙，那里面用了许多木头和高粱杆，老百姓正苦于没有柴烧，因为柴草也在扈全禄们搜刮之列。从这些领粮的老弱妇孺和破城的男人们那里，我才知道这个村庄过去比现在大，人口也多一些。为了修城墙和挖那条护城河，扈全禄强迫拆除了西南两面的两条街，大小七十六间房，十八户人家。那是三十四年春天的事，正是鬼子在的时候，那些标语图画是以后写的，门外那些字也是以后加的，旧历新年里扈全禄通知下来，有几家在正月十三日就自己动手拆，算是保住了几根柴烧。有一个叫做胡英的中年人对我说：“我迟到十五没动手，心里盘算着拆掉了住到那儿去呢，不料那天早晨就来了两个兵，你到底拆不拆？我煮好的一锅饭还没来得及吃，就给赶出来，梁柱都给他们拆去了，连柴火也没剩下一根。”胡英现在挤在他的兄弟家里，其他有好几户都到外面逃荒去了。
    工程进行了三四个月，正是农忙的时候，因此庄稼全耽误了。一个名叫杨彬的地主对我说：“我本来有一顷地，就是那一年这些东西把我压穷了。”他指着那城墙和炮楼说。如果说一个一顷的地主都压穷了，穷人呢，就是只有死路一条，一个叫做沈明德的中年人告诉我，他的伯父就是那时候活活给逼死的。
    破城的人正放下铁锹在休息，杨彬说：“现在可真是天晴了。这两天就没有人来找，铁锹也安安稳稳摆在这里，这几年来，年年三百六十天，那一天没有人来要东西，今天要这，明天要那，连一把铁锹也保不住！”
    我远远地望着那些领粮的老少满载归去，春天的太阳晒在他们身上。这是一个不平凡的春天，真是美妙和动人啊！
