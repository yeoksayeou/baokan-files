　　Retired Soldiers Lead the Way in Promoting Sowing Competition in Songshuping Village

　　[Report from Zuoquan by our newspaper] Under the slogan of "Mobilize urgently to complete sowing with a concentrated effort," Songshuping village has seen teams challenging each other and groups competing against each other, with retired soldiers and cadres launching waves of meritorious service. In particular, poor and hired peasant cadres and poor and middle peasant masses were heroes in the mass movement and must become heroes on the production front. On the evening of the third of this month, at a mass meeting, ten retired soldiers (out of a total of eleven in the village) declined substitute farming. Retired soldier Comrade Zhang Tiancai and political director Li Guijiang proposed three items for meritorious service competition: 1. Unite the masses without being special, and take the lead in mutual aid teams. 2. Consider both public and private interests, prioritize the public over the private, follow the mass line, have a democratic style, be upright and thrifty. 3. Achieve two ploughings and three weedings, without the help of the masses, and increase grain production by six sheng per mu. Raise one pig per household and two chickens per person; if they lose, they will give five hens. Retired soldier Comrade Li Yushan and village head Li Yutian also proposed a competition, with the conditions being deep ploughing and meticulous cultivation, achieving three ploughings with one to spare this year, saving half a jin of rice per person, and not smoking cigarettes. If they lose by autumn, they will give the village head five chickens. Following this, Wang Dongming, a first-class disabled veteran who had just settled down, said, "Although I am disabled and cannot move, I will learn to spin cotton. I have already spun three jin of cotton." Comrade Liu Jucai said, "After I retired from the army, I don't know how to do anything else, so I will give haircuts to the masses." The masses applauded to show their welcome. Under the meritorious service competition of retired soldiers and cadres, a movement of unity and friendship has been launched. Seidi Village has a shortage of livestock, and Dajie Village has proposed drawing a pair of draught animals every day to help with sowing. From the fourth to the tenth of this month, all villages are guaranteed to complete sowing within six days and will compete with Tongtan Town. Children and women have also been mobilized. The women's weaving group has decided to have nine people draw lots to weave cloth during the day and reel thread at night. In addition to weaving cloth, the remaining women will all go to the fields within six days. Li Lao Tai, who is sixty years old, also joined the mutual aid team to carry manure.
