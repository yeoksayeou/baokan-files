　　Combine the Merit Campaign with Strengthening Learning and Improving Skills
    Zhang Jichun
    The merit campaign in the army is unfolding universally and deeply, which is why we have seen a large number of heroes and models who have contributed to the people's liberation cause and are able to constantly win battles. In order to further deepen the merit campaign and achieve greater and more victories, it is very necessary to combine it with strengthening learning and improving skills in the war. Because the achievement of every large or small battle merit and the successful completion of every task are inseparable from the learning and skill improvement of the individual or unit that achieved the battle merit and made the achievement. Battle merits and work achievements can never be obtained by luck. The "thinking of ways" movement is a manifestation of the creativity of the masses, and it is also the masses' demand. Dealing with the enemy requires good methods, and the ability and skills must be improved. Courage must be combined with technology, that is to say, in addition to being brave, one must also understand the means of killing the enemy and be proficient in skills. Learning and striving for progress in struggle, and improving skills, is a quality that every officer and soldier of the People's Army should possess. It is also a prerequisite for every officer and soldier of the People's Army to do their job well, to be loyal to their job, and to serve the people and earn merit.

    Speaking of skills, due to the different positions and responsibilities of commanders at all levels, the different positions and responsibilities between officers and soldiers, and the different positions and responsibilities of the military, political, supply, and health departments, in the war, it is impossible to generalize that everyone is the same. There are great differences according to the work positions and nature of each individual and department. If the skill of a soldier lies in how to skillfully use the weapon in his hand to kill the enemy, then the squad leader is very different. In addition to skillfully using the weapon in his hand, the most important thing is how to command the actions and combat of his squad. Commanders at the platoon and company level, battalion and regimental level, and above should be more different and more complex in the skills they should be proficient in and familiar with. The higher the position, the heavier the responsibility, and the better or worse their learning and skills are, the greater the relationship with the success or failure of the cause. The same is true for each department. Whether its learning and skills have developed to the most perfect level, the impact is also very large. The organization and command of a battle or campaign, the complete implementation of a Party policy, the guarantee of supply, rescue, communication, and reconnaissance, and the consolidation and guarantee of political emotions and thoughts, all contain the art of precise command and organizational leadership.

    How to improve skills? Chairman Mao clearly instructed us in his book "Strategic Issues in China's Revolutionary War." He proposed: "The important thing is to be good at learning"; on the method of learning, he pointed out: "Recognize the situation of the enemy and ourselves in all aspects, find out the laws of their actions, and apply these laws to determine our own actions," "The key lies in properly integrating the subjective and the objective," "Use your heart to think," "Learn warfare from warfare—this is our main method," "Learn from warfare," "Entry is not difficult, and advanced studies are also possible, as long as you put your heart into it, as long as you are good at learning." Although what Chairman Mao said is about war guidance and the command of battles and campaigns, it is also completely suitable for application to other work. Therefore, in our combat, in the consolidation and training during battle gaps, in the commendation of heroes and models, in the evaluation of casualties, in the work of winning over and consolidating new recruits and officers and soldiers who have laid down their weapons, in the work of propaganda to the enemy, winning over residents, and implementing urban policies, etc., we must be good at summarizing experience in concrete terms, carrying forward strengths and correcting mistakes, so as to strengthen our actual learning, constantly improve ourselves, improve our skills, do our work well and fight well. The victory and shortcomings or mistakes of any battle and any work have many things worth our humble learning and should be learned.

    The Patriotic Self-Defense War has been going on for ten months, and the People's Liberation Army has achieved brilliant victories, and Chiang's army has suffered serious losses. Although Chiang Kai-shek's troops have occupied Yan'an and some areas, and Chiang Kai-shek is still desperately trying to support it, Chiang Kai-shek is in greater difficulty and is more passive. As long as we continue to inflict annihilation blows on Chiang Kai-shek's troops, the collapse of Chiang Kai-shek's troops will inevitably come. In the past nine months of war, we have indeed accumulated a lot of experience and have been tempered to be stronger, but we must not be satisfied with past achievements. The glorious task requires us to further strengthen and improve in the future, and become an even stronger iron People's Liberation Army. Therefore, we must implement Chairman Mao's instruction to "learn from war" to learn and improve our combat, consolidation and training, and military and political skills, so that we can build ourselves even stronger. In this way, our merit campaign can be carried out more practically and better.

　　把立功运动和加强学习提高业务结合起来
    张际春
    部队的立功运动正在普遍深入的展开着，所以我们出现了大批的、有功于人民解放事业的英雄模范，能不断的打胜仗。为了使立功运动更进一步的深入开展和取得更大更多的胜利，同时与加强战争中的学习提高业务结合起来是非常必要的。因为每一大小战功的获得和每一件工作的做好，都同那个获得战功作出了成绩的个人或单位的学习和业务的提高是分不开的。战功和工作成绩，决不是侥幸可以得到的。“想办法”的运动，是群众创造性的一种表现，同时也是群众要求。对付敌人要有好的办法、要提高本领和业务的表现。勇取与技术结合，亦是说除勇敢外还要懂得杀敌的手段和精通业务。斗争中学习求进步，提高业务，是每个人民军队官兵应有的品质，也是每个人民军队的官兵为了作好他们的工作、为了忠诚于他们的工作岗位、为了为人民服务和立功的前题。
    讲到业务，由于各级指挥员的地位和责任不同，官与兵之间地位和责任的不同，军事、政治、供给、卫生各部门的地位和责任不同，在战争中决不能笼统的，大家都是一样的，随着各个人、各部门的工作地位和性质而有很大的差别。如果一个战士的业务是于在如何熟练使用自己手中武器，杀死敌人的话，班长就大大的不同了，他除了熟练的使用自己手中武器以外，最主要的还在于如何指挥自己一班人的行动和作战，排连长、营团长及其以上的指挥员，所应精通和熟悉的业务就更不同、更复杂了。地位愈高，责任愈重，他们学习和业务的好坏关系与事业的成败亦愈大。各个部门也一样，他的学习和业务是否发展到最完善、影响所及亦是非常大的。一个战斗战役的组织与指挥，党的一个政策的完全实施，供给、救护、通讯、侦察之保证，政治情绪和思想巩固与保证等，无一不包含精细的指挥与组织领导的艺术。
    怎样去提高业务呢？毛主席在他所著“中国革命战争战略问题”一书中，曾经明确指示了我们。他提出：“重要的问题在善于学习”；在学习的方法上指出：“认识敌我双方各方面的情况，找出其行动的规律，并且应用这些规律决定自己的行动”，“关键就在于把主观与客观二者之间好好的融洽起来”，“要用心去想”，“从战争学习战争，——这是我们的主要方法”，“从战争中学习”，“入门既不难，深造也是办得到的，只要用心，只要善于学习罢了”，毛主席说的虽然是关于战争指导和战役战斗的指挥问题，运用之于其他工作亦是完全适合的。因此，我们在作战中，在战斗空隙的整训中，在表扬英雄模范中，在评定伤亡的工作中，在争取与巩固新兵和放下武器的官兵工作中，在对敌宣传、争取居民、执行城市政策等等的工作中，必须善于具体的总结经验，发扬优点与改正错误，从这中间来加强自己实际的学习，不断的提高自己，提高业务，作好工作打好仗，任何一个仗和一个工作的胜利与缺点或错误，都有很多值得我们虚心学习和应该学习的地方。
    爱国自卫战争已经进行到第十个月，人民解放军取得了辉煌的胜利，蒋军遭到了严重的损失，尽管蒋伪进占了延安和某些地区及蒋介石还仍然在拼命继续撑持，但蒋介石是更加困难更处于被动了，只要我们继续给蒋伪以歼灭的打击，蒋伪的崩溃必然要到来的。过去九个月的战争中，我们确是积累了很多经验，已经锻炼的更坚强了，但我们决不能满足于过去的成就，光荣的任务要求我们今后还必须更加加强、提高，成为更加坚强的铁的人民解放军。因此我们必须执行毛主席“从战争中学习”的指示来学习，来提高作战的、整训的、军事政治的业务，使自己建设的更坚强。这样我们的立功运动就能够更实际的、更好的展开起来。
