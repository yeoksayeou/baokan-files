Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st. Shanghai newspapers report: Some professors and staff at National Tsinghua University in Beiping recently refused to "subscribe" to the new bonds (i.e., "U.S. Dollar Bonds") to help the Kuomintang army. Professor Zhang Xiruo said that the Kuomintang is trying to foment civil war; because Zhang opposes civil war, he will not donate money. It is worth noting that the Beiping authorities have established a special agency to raise bonds for the Kuomintang army. The Beiping authorities have ordered all school teachers and staff to "subscribe" to these bonds with four months' salary.

　　北平教授拒买公债
    【新华社陕北一日电】沪报消息：北平国立清华大学若干教授职员等顷拒绝“认购”新公债（按即“美金公债”）帮助国民党军队。张奚若教授说，国民党力图滋长内战；因为张氏反对内战，所以他不捐款。值得注意的是北平当局已成立为国民党军队募集公债的专门机构，北平当局命令一切学校教员与职员以四个月薪金“认购”此项公债。
