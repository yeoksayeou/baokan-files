    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 6th dispatch] The people of the newly liberated Fushan and Yicheng counties are actively supporting the front with unparalleled enthusiasm. The 314 people's meritorious workers in Fushan, who persisted in the struggle for seven months, after hearing the call from the higher authorities to support the front at the commendation meeting on April 27, set off a new wave of participation in the war. They immediately took the lead in organizing 200 stretchers, and 230 militiamen also set off for the Jinmiao front. The masses in the whole county responded quickly and organized 300 carts to join the team. County and district cadres also participated in the leadership, with five vehicles forming a group, five groups forming a squad, led by the district cadres, each district forming a company, and the whole county forming a large team, led by the county cadres. Each large team and company had a cook, and the company also had a doctor and a veterinarian. A temporary recuperation center was set up to take care of the sick civilian porters participating in the war. Women in Shangjiao Village, Er District, Yicheng, heard that the wounded from the liberation of Quwo City were coming down, and 60 women in the village volunteered to wash bloody clothes for the wounded. They didn't even bother to eat, washing from morning till night. Ren Yulian said: "It must be washed white and pounded soft, so that the wounded will not feel pain when they wear it." Women in Lijia Mountain also brought needlework bags, washed and dried them casually on the river beach, and sewed up the broken places. The wounded put them on and said: "It's well washed, and it's soft and doesn't rub the wound at all."
