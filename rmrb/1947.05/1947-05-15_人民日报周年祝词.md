　　Anniversary Congratulatory Message for People's Daily
    In the past year, China has experienced unprecedented major events in history: one is the resolute implementation and victorious completion of the land reform policy in the liberated areas; the other is the large-scale patriotic self-defense war and democratic movement, which unfolded magnificently and developed victoriously. The Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region, in these two major events, its position, its role, and its achievements were particularly solemn and great. The People's Daily was born and grew up in the occurrence and development of these two major events and within such a border region, then, undoubtedly, its contribution to the liberation struggle of the border region and the Chinese people and their democratic nation-building cause is very brilliant and far-reaching. I would like to extend warm congratulations as a loyal reader and supporter!

　　人民日报周年祝词
    过去的一年，中国发生了历史上空前的大事件：一件是解放区土地改革政策的坚决执行和胜利完成。一件是大规模的爱国自卫战争和民主运动，壮烈的展开，胜利的发展。而晋冀鲁豫边区，在这两大事件中，所处的地位，所起的作用和所获成就，都特别的庄严和伟大。人民日报，就在这两大事件的发生发展和在这样的边区内诞生成长的，那末，无疑的，它对于边区和中国人民的解放斗争及其民主建国事业的贡献，都是非常辉煌和远大的，我愿以一个忠实的读者与拥护者，致以热烈的祝贺！
