Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 2nd. The counties of Xixian, Yonghe, Shilou, Zhongyang, and Fenxi in the new district of Southwest Shanxi are making every effort to carry out land reform. In the past two months, more than 60,000 people in more than 500 villages have been mobilized to participate in the struggle to settle accounts and distribute land, and more than 110,000 mu of cultivated land have been returned to poor peasants. However, since the areas have only recently been liberated, they are busy supporting the front lines, and cadres lack experience, and their policies and ideas are not very clear. Most villages have not yet fully realized "land to the tiller." Some places are eager to complete the task before the spring plowing to save trouble. Most areas have not actively mobilized the masses to struggle, but instead have mobilized landlords to donate land. As a result, the more than 40,000 mu of land obtained by farmers are mostly bad land, and the prestige of the landlords and bullies has not been defeated. Some places are not clear about thoroughly eliminating feudal ideas and emphasize taking care, so landlords still occupy too much good land and ignore the liquidation of other properties of landlords. In order to quickly and thoroughly complete land reform, the leading organs of the Party, government, army, and people in the area have dispatched more than 200 cadres to form several work teams to go to various counties, districts, and villages to assist in the work.

　　吕梁抽调二百余干部
    分赴新区领导分田
    【新华社晋绥二日电】晋西南新区隰县、永和、石楼、中阳、汾西等县正全力进行土地改革，两月来已在五百余村发动六万余群众参加清算分地斗争，已有十一万亩耕地归还贫苦农民手中。惟各地解放不久，忙于支援前线，且干部经验不够，政策思想不很明确，大部村庄尚未完全实现耕者有其田。有的地方急于在春耕前完成，图省事；大部地区未积极发动群众斗争，而系发动地主献地，因而农民所得四万余亩土地，多是坏地，地主恶霸威风未能打垮。有的地方对彻底消灭封建思想不明确，强调照顾，因而地主仍占有过多好地，并忽视地主其他财产的清算。为求土地改革迅速彻底完成，该区党政军民领导机关已抽调二百余干部，组成若干工作团，分赴各县区村帮助工作。
