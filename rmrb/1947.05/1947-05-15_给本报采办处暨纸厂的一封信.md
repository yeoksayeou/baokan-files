To the comrades of the Handan Purchasing Department, Jinan Purchasing Department, People's Paper Mill, and No. 1 Paper Mill of this newspaper: Over the past year, you have worked diligently for the Party newspaper, ensuring the supply of paper and materials, and your achievements are excellent. The employees of the paper mill have demonstrated initiative and creativity, greatly improving quality, increasing output, and reducing costs. Moreover, in the upsurge of vigorously supporting the front lines, you have launched a production competition movement and a savings contribution movement. This spirit of work is admirable and praiseworthy! As we commemorate the anniversary of this newspaper, we extend our regards from afar, and hope that you will continue to work harder, adding merit to merit, improving quality, increasing production, implementing policies, ensuring the supply of paper and materials, and victoriously completing new and greater tasks. We extend our respects!
        And wish you well,
                          People's Daily Management Department (with picture)
