　　[This newspaper's dispatch from Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 7th] Our correspondent commented on the situation in the Seventh Sub-district after the recovery of Dongping and Wenshang, saying: At present, with the exception of the isolated city of Jining, all county towns in the entire sub-district have been recovered by us. The vast area of the entire sub-district has returned to the situation before the Jiang army re-invaded in late February. From the occupation of Jiaxiang in late February to the recovery of Wenshang in late April, the situation has fundamentally changed in just two months. The Jiang army has changed from actively attacking and seizing cities to abandoning cities and fleeing. Our army has completely shifted from retreat to actively recovering lost territory. This fully demonstrates Jiang's dilemma of being unable to attend to everything and having insufficient troops. A month ago, the Jiang army launched a frantic attack with tens of thousands of its main forces, and loudly trumpeted its "victory," but it turned out to be just a pipe dream. The situation shows that as long as we bravely and actively fight against the enemy, not only can our work be sustained, but we can also recover lost territory. The military and civilians in the Jining, Jibei, and Nanwang areas of the Seventh Sub-district have worked hard, and the situation is also easy to restore. On the contrary, in some individual counties, the lack of active struggle has resulted in a depressed public sentiment and rampant landlords, reactionaries, and special agents, which has made restoration work difficult. Although the Seventh Sub-district has now returned to the situation before the guerrilla war, the possibility of enemy "mopping-up operations" still exists. Therefore, the entire district is currently taking advantage of the lull in the war to rapidly restore all organizations in a state of preparedness and vigorously launch the land redistribution and army enlistment movement.
　　[This newspaper's dispatch from Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 7th] Since the beginning of the guerrilla war, the troops of the Seventh Sub-district of Hebei-Shandong-Henan have engaged in over 40 battles of various sizes with the enemy, killing and capturing more than 500 enemies, liberating the two cities of Dongping and Wenshang, and eliminating enemy special agents and "Homecoming Legions" in the two counties. Especially after tens of thousands of Jiang bandits' main forces infiltrated Dongping County at the end of March, the situation in Dongping underwent serious changes, and the masses suffered a great disaster. In order to protect the lives and property of tens of thousands of people, the troops inserted themselves into the enemy's heart without any hesitation, and taking advantage of the enemy's unstable foothold, led local militia to eliminate the puppet district and township governments. Since then, the troops have attacked the enemy every day, compressing them within Dongping City, preventing them from venturing out. The Battle of the North Bridge in Dongping terrified the enemy, causing them to abandon the city and flee. Subsequently, the troops launched a further offensive, bringing the army to the city of Wenshang. The enemy in Wenshang fled eastward in panic. From then on, this land in the Seventh Sub-district was once again the people's world.
　　[This newspaper's dispatch from Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 7th] On April 28, more than 20 enemies departing from Yuncheng, traveling in two cars, advanced along the Yuncheng-Wenshang highway to Yuan Kou Bridge at 9:00 AM. The bridge had already been destroyed by us, forcing the enemy to turn back. The Nanwang Brigade dispatched more than 30 people to intercept them. A battle unfolded at Rongxing, and the enemy, unable to withstand the attack, abandoned their vehicles and fled. We seized two cars and captured three enemy drivers and more than ten members of the "Homecoming Legion," seizing one grenade launcher, one light machine gun, seven rifles, some ammunition, and more than 4,000 catties of white cloth.

### 冀鲁豫七分区失地大部恢复

　　冀鲁豫七分区失地大部恢复
    【本报冀鲁豫七日电】分社记者评论东平、汶上收复后之七分区形势称：现全分区除济宁孤城外，所有县城均已为我收复，全分区广大地面，已恢复了二月下旬蒋军再度侵入以前的形势。自二月下旬嘉祥被占，及四月下旬汶上收复，刚刚两个月时间，形势就起了根本变化，蒋军由主动的攻城夺地，变为弃城逃窜。我军则由退却，完全转为主动收复失地。这充分说明蒋顾此失彼，兵力不足的窘态。一个月前，蒋军以数万主力作疯狂进攻，并大吹大擂其“胜利”，原来只是南柯一梦。形势说明，只要是我们英勇积极对敌斗争，非但工作可以坚持，且能收复失地。七分区济宁、济北、南旺地区军民艰苦奋斗，局面也易恢复。相反的，有个别县份，不积极斗争，结果造成群情消沉，地主反动特务四出，以致恢复工作遭受困难。目前七分区虽已恢复了游击战争以前的形势，但敌人“扫荡”的可能仍然存在，故全区现正利用战争空隙在备战状态下，迅速恢复一切组织，大力展开分田参军运动。
    【本报冀鲁豫七日电】冀鲁豫七分区部队自游击战争开始以来，与敌大小作战达四十次，毙俘敌人五百余，解放东平、汶上两城，肃清两个县的敌特和“还乡团”。尤以从三月底蒋贼主力数万人窜入东平县后，东平的局面起了严重变化，群众遭受浩劫。该部为了数万人民的生命财产，丝毫无顾虑的插入敌人心脏，乘敌立足未稳，领导地方民兵消灭伪区、乡政权。自此以后，该部每天袭击敌人，将敌压缩在东平城内，不敢出扰。东平北大桥一役，使敌恐慌万分，弃城逃窜，接着该部展开进一步攻势，兵临汶上城下，汶上敌人仓惶东窜。从此七分区这片土地，复为人民的天下。
    【本报冀鲁豫七日电】四月二十八日，由郓城出发之敌二十余名，分乘汽车两辆，于上午九时由郓汶公路进至袁口桥时，桥已为我破坏，敌被迫返驶。南旺大队派出三十余人前往截击，当于荣形展开战斗，敌不支弃车逃窜。汽车两辆为我所获，并俘敌司机三人，“还乡团”十余名，缴获掷弹筒一个，轻机枪一挺，步枪七枝，子弹一部，白布四千余斤。
