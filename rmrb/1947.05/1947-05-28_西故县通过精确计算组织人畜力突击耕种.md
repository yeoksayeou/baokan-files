　　Xigu County Organizes Human and Animal Power to Rush Planting Through Precise Calculation
    [Our newspaper, Xiangyuan News] Xigu County Village, Xiangyuan, has a total of 2303.59 mu of land. The village currently has 67 full male laborers (including male half-laborers converted), with each laborer cultivating an average of 34.1 mu of land. Normally, one laborer can only cultivate 20 mu of land, so the whole village would need 115 laborers to avoid leaving land uncultivated, a shortage of 48 full laborers for the whole year. Even if the 22 auxiliary laborers are organized (three equivalent to one full laborer), there would still be a shortage of 41 laborers for the whole year. The whole village has 11 head of cattle, 5 donkeys, and 1 mule, totaling 14 teams of animal power, with each team cultivating an average of 159 mu of land. Normally, one team of animals can only cultivate 100 mu of land, resulting in a shortage of 9 teams of animal power. Adding the fact that a batch of laborers would be drawn for war participation, the masses were increasingly worried and lacked the confidence to plant and complete the "cultivating three and reserving one" task, and production tended towards fatigue and drift. The village leadership organized the masses to collectively find ways to solve the difficulties of labor and animal power. Finally, they came up with: (1) convening a forum for honorably discharged soldiers, inspiring ideological awareness of production, organizing their production and overcoming difficulties in production. Six honorably discharged soldiers declined the masses' offer of cultivation on their behalf, saving six laborers and one animal. (2) Making military martyrs' families aware of the village's difficulties in labor and animal power, organizing self-cultivation production, saving one and a half animals and six full laborers. (3) Organizing 90 female laborers to work in the fields, equivalent to 30 full male laborers. (4) Rectifying and tightening the village cooperative and mutual aid societies, streamlining nine people to turn to agricultural production, and extracting one animal. (5) Implementing a combination of agriculture and mining, organizing 24 coal mine workers to participate in the rush planting. (6) Organizing five landlords who had been struggled against to help the masses with farm work. After careful organization and precise calculation, a total of 80 laborers and three and a half animals were squeezed out, the masses' confidence was enhanced, and they organized people to pull plows, starting early and working late to rush planting. In a blitz of eight days, twelve qing of land were planted, and everyone unanimously determined to complete the planting half a month ahead of schedule.

　　西故县通过精确计算组织人畜力突击耕种
    【本报襄垣讯】襄垣西故县村，共有土地二三○三·五九亩，全村现有男全劳力共六十七个（男半劳力折合在内），每个劳力平均耕地三四·一亩。平常一个劳力只能种地二十亩，这样全村就需一百十五个劳力才能不荒地，全年短下四十八个全劳力，再把二十二个辅助劳力组织起来（三个折一全劳力），全年尚短四十一个劳力。全村有牛十一头，驴五头，骡一头，共折十四犋畜力，每犋平均耕地一五九亩。平常一犋牲口只能耕地一百亩，畜力就短九犋，加上准备参战又要抽走一批劳力，群众愁上加愁，没信心下种与完成耕三余一，生产走向疲塌自流。村领导上便组织群众集体想法解决劳畜力的困难。最后想出：（一）召开荣退军人座谈会，启发生产自觉思想，组织其生产并克服生产中困难，六个荣退军人谢绝群众代耕，节余出六个劳力一个牲口。（二）让军烈属认识本村劳畜力困难，组织自耕生产，节余牲口一个半，全劳力六个。（三）组织妇女劳力九十个上地生产，共折男全劳力三十个。（四）整顿紧缩村合作社与互助社，精简九个人转向农业生产，并抽出一个牲口来。（五）实行农矿业结合，组织煤窑工人二十四个参加突击下种。（六）组织五个被斗地主给群众打忙工。经细密组织与精确计算后，共挤出八十个劳力，三个半牲口，群众信心提高，组织人拉犁，起早搭黑的忙着下种，突击八天就下种十二顷，大家一致确定提前半月完成下种。
