　　The Border Government Completes Assistance to Agriculture
    Assistance to Agriculture Surges Across the Region
    [Reported by this newspaper] The Border Government's participation in the spring plowing work in stationed villages has concluded victoriously. In eleven days of plowing on behalf of the people, 55 labor days and 53 animal labor days were expended, plowing a total of more than 91 mu of land. "The remaining ten mu will be plowed when it rains." The labor cost for plowing each mu is calculated at 16 jin of millet, saving the masses over 95,000 yuan. This was particularly appreciated by the masses, as it coincided with the time when they were cutting off feudal vestiges and preparing labor for participation in the war effort. As a village cadre said, "The Border Government's plowing on our behalf has solved a great difficulty for us." An elderly widow said, "I have never seen such a government before, plowing the land for us common people." Many families brought boiled water and cigarettes to the comrades who were plowing, and some even brought steamed buns, all of which we politely declined except for the tea and cigarettes. Due to the Border Government's leading role in assisting agriculture, the masses in the stationed area have now formulated a one-week spring plowing plan and are engaging in mutual challenges and competitions in cultivation.

    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 2nd dispatch] On the 21st of this month, various organs, organizations, and state-owned stores in Anze County extracted 33 head of livestock to help the masses with spring plowing. Two heads of livestock were combined into one team, and they have now cultivated 448 mu of land for the masses.
    [This newspaper, Heshun dispatch] The intense spring plowing and sowing stage has arrived. In order to more effectively help lead the masses in production, the Heshun County Party Committee held a meeting on April 19th and decided to reduce personnel in various system organs, leaving only one person to support miscellaneous affairs, and extracting the rest to go deep into various district villages to lead production.

    [Reported by this newspaper] The Supply Department of the Military Region began helping the masses in the stationed area with spring plowing on April 19th. All comrades in the department enthusiastically participated in this work. Director Zheng of the Political Department, Section Chief Hou, Section Chief Wang, and others took time to participate one after another. Comrade Yang Jian, a pharmacist, although in poor health, also insisted on participating for two days and worked as vigorously as the male comrades. Preliminary statistics as of the 21st show that a total of 134.5 labor days were contributed, and 132 ridges were dug (equivalent to approximately 250 mu of land). In addition, some miscellaneous work such as delivering manure was also done. The masses here unanimously praised, "This is truly a military-civilian family, helping each other!" The Director of Resistance and Diligence excitedly told me, "Hey! This time you have really solved a big difficulty. If it weren't for your help, there would be no way to solve the difficulties of the military dependents alone!" (Shu Gong)

　　边府完成助耕
    全区各地掀起助耕热潮
    【本报讯】边府参加驻村春耕工作已胜利结束。代耕十一天，费人工五十五个，牲口工五十三个，共犁地九十一亩多。“其余十亩待落雨始能犁”。犁地每亩工价以十六斤小米计，共为群众节省九万五千余元。时值群众割封建尾巴及准备参战劳力缺乏之际，特别为群众所感激，如村干部说：“边府代耕，给我们解决了很大困难。”一寡妇老太太说：“我从来没见过这样的政府，还给我们百姓犁地。”很多家去给犁地的同志送开水和香烟，还有的送包子，而我们除烟水之外，均婉言拒绝。由于边府之带头助耕，现在驻地群众已订定一周春耕计划，正互相挑战竞赛耕作中。（奇之）
    【本报太岳二日电】安泽县各机关团体及公营商店于本月二十一日，抽出牲口三十三头，帮助群众春耕，两头每合一犋，现已为群众耕种四百四十八亩。
    【本报和顺讯】紧张的春耕播种阶段已到来，和顺县委为更有力的帮助领导群众生产，于四月十九号开会决定紧缩各系统机关人员，除留一个人支持杂务事，其余全部抽出深入各区村领导生产。（桂林）
    【本报讯】军区供给部，于四月十九日开始帮助驻地群众春耕，该部全体同志热烈参与这一工作，政治部郑主任、侯科长、王科长等均先后抽暇参加，许多同志连续参加三天，司药杨健同志，她虽然身体不好，但也坚持参加两天，且干起来和男同志一样有劲。截止二十一日初步统计：共参加人工一百三十四个半，刨地堰一百三十二道（约合地二百五十余亩），另外还作了些送粪杂活。此间群众一致称赞：“这才真是军民一家，互相帮助哩！”抗勤主任兴奋的告诉我：“嗨！这回真的解决了很大困难，要不是你们帮助，只军属的困难就没法办！”（述恭）
