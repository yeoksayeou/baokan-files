　　Taiyue Actively Repairs Canals to Prevent Drought
　　Jiyuan, Yangcheng, and Other Counties Have 9,000 Mu of Land Benefit from Water Conservancy
　　[This newspaper, Taiyue, 27th dispatch] The democratic government actively uses financial and technical resources to help the masses build water conservancy projects to prevent drought. Jiyuan, Yangcheng, Shimin, and Tunliu counties have repaired three old canals and dug six new canals, which can irrigate more than 9,000 mu of land. The Guanghui Canal in the Third District of Jiyuan was built in the Ming Dynasty. Since then, landlords, local bullies, and puppet bandits have taken the opportunity to extort money from the people every time it was repaired. In 1934, the puppet army Li Zhengde forced the people to repair the canal and embezzled 5 million yuan from it. This year, when it was repaired, the administrative office lent 2 million yuan and sent a water conservancy team to assist. The masses all said, "This is something that hasn't happened in 500 years." The enthusiasm of the masses for repairing the canal was high. It was originally planned to be completed in ten days, but it was completed in only nine days. This canal can irrigate 5,000 mu of land. A new canal was built in Huaizhuang, Shimin, with a loan of 40,000 yuan from the Jinnan Bank, which can irrigate 4,000 mu of land. Zhang Shuncheng, the village chief of Zhucun Village in Yangcheng, led the masses to repair the canal. When he encountered several broken areas, he devised a method of bundling kerosene barrels to make troughs to collect water. The canal has now been completed and can irrigate more than 40 mu of land. When the masses in Zhongzhai Village, Yangcheng, were repairing the canal, the village office only kept two people to insist on working, and the rest participated in mutual aid labor.

　　太岳积极修渠防旱
  　济源阳城等县九千亩地获水利
    【本报太岳二十七日电】民主政府积极以财力技术帮助群众兴修水利预防旱灾。济源、阳城、士敏、屯留四县又修旧渠挖新渠三址六条，可灌溉九千余亩。济源三区广惠渠兴修于明朝，以后每次修补，地主、豪绅、伪匪即乘机勒索民财。民国三址三年伪军李正德逼迫民众修渠，一次即从中贪污五百万元。今年修理时，行署贷款二百万元，并派水利组前往协助，群众都说：“这是五百年来没有过的事”。群众修渠高涨，原拟十天修毕，结果仅用九天完工，此渠可浇地五千亩。士敏槐庄新修水渠一道，冀南银行贷款四万元，可浇地四千亩。阳城朱村村长张顺成同志领导群众修渠，遇到几处断绝地带，均设法用煤油筒束起，做成槽子接水。现该渠已经修成，可浇地四十余亩。阳城中寨村在群众修渠时，村公所祗留两俱坚持工作，其余都参加互助劳动。
