Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi Front, urgent telegram, 6th: The Northwest People's Liberation Army captured Panlong Town, Hu Zongnan's most important strategic supply station and fortified stronghold, 90 li northeast of Yan'an, at dusk on the 4th. The 167th Brigade of the First Division, Hu Zongnan's most elite unit, which was guarding Panlong, was completely wiped out, with the exception of one regiment that was not in Panlong. Hu Zongnan's most trusted cadres, Brigade Commander Li Kungang, Deputy Brigade Commander Tu Jian, Chief of Staff Liu Quchun, 499th Regiment Commander Xiao Bolian, Deputy Regiment Commander Fu Yutong, and more than 6,500 others were captured alive. Over a thousand Hu troops were killed or wounded. According to preliminary statistics, the following were seized: 6 mountain guns, over 40,000 sets of single uniforms, over 12,000 bags of foreign flour, and over 1,000 mules and horses. Detailed battle results are still being verified.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi Front, 5th: On the 2nd and 3rd, the Northwest People's Liberation Army shot down one Chiang Kai-shek aircraft each in the Panlong area northeast of Yan'an and the Suide southwest area. The former caught fire in the tail after being hit and crashed near Qinghuabian. The latter was burned and destroyed, and the pilot made a futile sacrifice. Five machine guns on board were seized by the People's Liberation Army. Since March 19, four Chiang Kai-shek aircraft have been shot down on the Northwest battlefield in the past month and a half. Of the previous two, one crashed in Panlong, and the wreckage still exists. The other crashed in Masi River, on the bank of the Yan River, and the pilot was captured by the People's Guerrilla Force. The weapons in the plane were also dismantled and used by the Guerrilla Force.

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 5th: Northwest Front Reporter Ye Bin reports: After the liberation of Longfang Town, 40 li northwest of中部 (Zhongbu) County, on the main road between Yan'an and Xi'an, the people saw the light of day again and immediately rose up to tear down the signboard of the Chiang Kai-shek town government and re-established the people's government. During the land revolution, a people's government had once been established in the town, but it was later destroyed, and it suffered from the ravages of the Chiang-Hu troops for twelve years. This time, after liberation, the villagers who had suffered for a long time in the town and nearby villages warmly surrounded the staff of the Liberation Army and complained about the crimes of the Hu Zongnan bandit gang. Just the fact that Zhang Huiyang, a 50-year-old blind man from Qiang Village, committed suicide by jumping off a cliff after being forcibly conscripted by the Hu troops made his brother burst into tears when he mentioned it. In nearby Gulu Village, 13 out of more than 30 households had fled because they could not bear the heavy burden. They only returned after the Liberation Army arrived. In the past two months, the village had paid 1.1 million Chiang Kai-shek currency just for military funds. The day before the liberation, the Chiang government sent another 11 shi of wheat to the village, requiring it to be delivered in full within three days. Zhang Mingru from the village said, "We would have been in big trouble if you had come a day later."

　　延安东北我克蟠龙  歼敌精锐七千五百
    一六七旅正副旅长就擒
    【新华社陕北前线六日急电】延安东北九十里之胡宗南最重要的战略补给站及强固据点蟠龙镇，于四日黄昏被西北人民解放军攻克，据守蟠龙的胡宗南最精锐的第一师一六七旅，除不在蟠龙的一个团以外，全部就歼。生俘胡宗南最心腹干部旅长李昆岗、副旅长涂健、参谋长柳屈春、四九九团团长萧伯廉、副团长傅毓通以下六千五百余名，毙伤胡军千余名。据初步统计：缴获山炮六门、单军衣四万余套、洋面一万二千余袋、骡马千余匹；详细战果正清查中。
    【新华社陕北前线五日电】二、三两日西北人民解放军连续于延安东北蟠龙地区及绥德西南地区击落蒋机各一架。前者尾部中弹起火，落于青化砭附近。后者被击焚毁，驾驶员作了无谓牺牲。机上机枪五挺为人民解放军缴获。自三月十九日迄今一个半月，蒋机在西北战场已被击落四架。前此之两架一架落于蟠龙，现残骸犹存。另一架落于延水岸旁之马寺川，驾驶员为人民游击队俘获，机中武器也被游击队拆卸使用。
    【新华社西北五日电】西北前线记者叶滨报导：延安、西安间要道上之中部县西北四十里之龙坊镇解放后，人民重见天日，立即群起打掉蒋记镇公所的牌子，重新建立了人民政府。该镇土地革命时曾一度建立人民政权，后被摧残，受蒋胡军蹂躏达十二年之久。此次解放，该镇及附近村庄久经苦难的老乡们，亲热的围着解放军工作人员申诉胡宗南匪帮的罪恶。仅在强村的五十岁瞎子张惠仰被胡军抓夫跳崖自杀的事，他哥哥一提起就热泪盈眶。附近古路村三十多户人已有十三户因受不住苛重的负担逃亡了。解放军到后他们才纷纷归来，该村近两个月来仅军款一项就出了一百一十万蒋币，解放前一日蒋政府又派了该村十一石麦子，限三天内扫数送完，该村张明如说：“你们迟来一天我们就不得了。”
