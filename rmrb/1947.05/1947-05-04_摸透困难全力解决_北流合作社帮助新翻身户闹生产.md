　　Grasping Difficulties Thoroughly and Solving Them with All Efforts
    Beiliu Cooperative Helps Newly Emancipated Households Engage in Production
    [Report from this newspaper, Licheng] After the peasants of Beiliu Village were allocated land, their enthusiasm for production soared. However, the newly emancipated households lacked collateral. The newly emancipated peasants collectively owned 893 mu of land, but only had 18 working donkeys and oxen. Each animal had to cultivate an average of 46 mu. Calculating based on need, there was still a shortage of one-half of the necessary farming tools. Fertilizer was even more scarce; based on the existing fertilizer supply, there were only 12 loads per mu. Based on this situation, the cooperative immediately tried every possible way to solve this problem. The credit department (affiliated with the cooperative) lent 1,090,000 yuan to 28 emancipated peasant households, helping them buy 12 donkeys and 5 mules. Furthermore, 13 newly emancipated households, including Hu Xian, received loans of 90,000 yuan to help repair and purchase farming tools. The blacksmith's furnace has recently been dedicated to making farming tools, and has already completed 22 pieces. The plan is to complete 150 pieces this spring, thoroughly solving the village's shortage of farming tools. Regarding fertilizer, the oil mill had over 33,000 jin of oil cake in storage from last winter and this spring, enough to fertilize 300 mu of land. The flour mill accumulated 1,600 loads of manure by raising pigs, enough for 40 mu. In total, this can solve the fertilizer problem for 340 mu. The cooperative has plans to sell these to the emancipated peasants who lack fertilizer at low prices. The emancipated peasants greatly support the cooperative's concrete assistance. They said, "Without the cooperative's help, we wouldn't even be able to plant the land this spring, let alone achieve 'cultivating three and reserving one!'"

    北流合作社帮助新翻身户闹生产
    【本报黎城讯】北流村农民分到土地后，生产情绪高涨，但新翻身户没有抵垫；新翻身农民共有土地八百九十三亩，只有能耕种的驴牛十八头，每头畜力平均要耕种四十六亩，农具按够用计算，尚缺二分之一，肥料更感困难，按现有肥料计算，每亩地只有十二驮。合作社据此情况，即想尽一切办法来解决这个问题，信用部（附属合作社内）贷给二十八户翻身农民款一百零九万元，帮助买了驴十二头、骡五头，还有虎贤等十三户（新翻身）贷款九万元帮助修买农具。铁匠炉近日是专制农具，现已完成廿二件，计划今春完成一百五十件，彻底解决全村的农具困难。在肥料上，油坊去冬今春存有油饼三万三千余斤，可上地三百亩，粉坊养猪积肥一千六百驮，可上四十亩，共可解决三百四十亩的肥料问题，合作社都有计划的贱价出卖给缺肥料的翻身农民，合作社具体帮助，翻身农民均极拥护，他们说：“不是合作社帮助，今春连地也种不上，更不用说耕三余一啦。”
