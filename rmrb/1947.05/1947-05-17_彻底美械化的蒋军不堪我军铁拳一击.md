　　Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 12th: A front-line reporter met Chen Shengju, lieutenant colonel and deputy regimental commander of the First Regiment of the 44th Brigade of the 83rd Division of the Chiang army, captured in the Lin (Yi) Meng (Yin) Road battle, at a certain place. Regarding the annihilation of the regiment, Chen said: "The soldiers of the First Regiment received very good training (referring to the meticulous training by American instructors), and each person fired 600 rounds of live ammunition in India; but now they have no energy in battle, hide in the trenches and do not move, and fire their guns haphazardly at the sky in a panic. The internal structure of the team is like it is full of maggots and collapsing on its own. Even the officers are unwilling to continue. More than a dozen officers have left in the past month, and a company commander cried and asked to become an adjutant. Once they become adjutants, they go to the rear." Chen also admitted that although he was proficient in using American equipment, he had lost interest in it. He said: Every soldier carries a full load of equipment weighing sixty to seventy catties, and can only walk twenty to thirty li per day, and ammunition is insufficient, making it impossible to deploy in mountainous areas. Another lieutenant colonel and deputy regimental commander, Mao Lirang (note: the regiment had two deputy regimental commanders), said: "The regimental commander (i.e., the commander of the First Regiment), Lin Guanhong, abandoned his position and retreated one day after the battle began." Major battalion commander Zhang Zengying said: The officers and soldiers of the regiment have been in service for three to five years, but the number of soldiers who have deserted or been reduced in number has reached one-third. It is reported that the regiment was formerly the Second Battalion of the Student Soldier Corps of Chiang Kai-shek's Ministry of Military Administration, and was later renamed the Second Artillery Regiment. Its members were all young students, and it was a "family army" cultivated single-handedly by the reactionary He Yingqin. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the regiment was sent to India and renamed the First Infantry Regiment of the Chinese Expeditionary Force's Student Soldier Corps. Later, it was incorporated into the Sino-American Mixed Brigade with the US 5332nd Brigade, and was thoroughly equipped with American equipment (i.e., even war horses and miscellaneous military supplies were all American-made), and meticulously trained by American instructors. It went to Burma, and returned to China after the Japanese surrender, and was incorporated into the First Regiment of the Honorary Second Division of the Chiang army, and later renamed the First Regiment of Dai Jian's 67th Division. The division was originally scheduled to go to Japan as an occupation force, but at the end of August last year it crossed the Yangtze River from Shanghai to attack the Suzhong Liberated Area. On March 1st of this year, it was reorganized into the 44th Brigade in Linyi, Shandong, and placed under the command of the 83rd Division. The regiment was the First Regiment of the 44th Brigade of the 83rd Division. From April 30th to May 1st, it was completely annihilated in the area of ​​Qingtu Temple on the Lin (Yi) Meng (Yin) Road. Although the regiment often boasted of being the "Number One Regiment in the World," it was wiped out with one blow of the People's Liberation Army's iron fist.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 14th: More than a thousand Chiang army officers and soldiers who laid down their weapons and arrived in Harbin held a "New and Old Friends Get-Together" with the People's Liberation Army on the 6th. General Li Minran, representative of the General Headquarters of the Democratic Allied Forces, called on everyone: "We must look at reality more, distinguish right from wrong, and be determined to serve the people." Then Chen Jiazhen, the former Chiang army commander of the Changchun garrison, spoke, saying: "Being a prisoner of the people and bowing to the truth is not only not a disgrace, but also a glorious thing. It is the beginning of one's new life." He then swore to the assembly: "Determined to break away from the Kuomintang reactionaries, stand on the side of the people, and atone for our crimes." Li Zhengzhong, former member of the Chiang Kai-shek municipal party committee in Changchun, said: "In the past, we took the road of betraying the people. Now, only by strengthening our study can we approach the truth and completely transform ourselves." Lu Shidi, former secretary of the Chiang Kai-shek Liaobei Provincial Government and a veteran Kuomintang member of fifteen years, after recounting Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous actions from the War of Resistance to the present, proposed that in the name of the liberated army personnel, a telegram be sent to the whole country to accuse Chiang Kai-shek of his traitorous crimes.

　　彻底美械化的蒋军不堪我军铁拳一击
    【新华社华东前线十二日电】前线记者于某地会见了临（沂）蒙（阴）路战斗中就俘之蒋军八十三师四四旅一团中校副团长陈盛举，对该团被歼，陈氏说道：“第一团士兵受过很好的训练（按指曾由美教官精心训练），在印度每人都打过六百发实弹靶；可是现在打仗没有劲，躲在阵地里不动，慌得朝天乱打枪。队伍内部像生了蛆，自己坍了。连当官的都不愿干下去。一个月来军官走了十几个，一连连长哭哭啼啼要当附员，当了附员便到后方去了。”陈氏复自承虽是熟用美械，亦已对之失去兴趣。他说：每个兵士全付装备六七十斤重，每天走二三十里路就不得了，而且弹药不足，在山地更无法施展。另一中校副  团长茆礼让（按该团有两个副团长）谈称：“团长（按即第一团团长）为林冠雄，于战斗开始一天后即弃阵而退。”少校营长张曾颖谓：该团官兵伍龄均在三、五年以上，然士兵逃亡减员数达三分之一。按该团前身为蒋记军政部学兵总队第二大队，后改为炮兵第二团，成员全为青年学生，系反动派何应钦一手培植的“家兵家将”。抗战期间，该团曾开往印度，易名为驻印军学兵总队步兵第一团，后又与美军五三三二旅合编为中美混合旅，彻底美式装备（即战马及零星军用物件亦均为美国产），由美教官精心训练。到过缅甸，日寇投降后回国，编入蒋军荣誉第二师，后改六七师戴坚部第一团。该师原定开往日本为占领军，去年八月底由沪渡江进攻苏中解放区，于今年三月一日在山东临沂改编为四四旅，归八三师建制。该团乃为八三师四四旅一团。四月三十日至五月一日，全部就歼于临（沂）蒙（阴）路上之青驼寺一带。虽该团常自诩为“天下第一团”，但人民解放军铁拳一击即被消灭。
    【新华社东北十四日电】放下武器抵哈之蒋军千余官兵于六日举行被解放军人“新老朋友联欢会”，民主联军总司部代表李敏然将军号召大家：“要多看现实，辨别是非，下定决心为人民服务。”接着前蒋军长春城防司令陈家珍发言，他说：“作了人民的俘虏，向真理低头，不仅不是耻辱，而且是一件光荣的事情。是自己新生命的开始。”继向大会宣誓：“决心脱离国民党反动派，站到人民方面来，将功折罪。”前长春蒋记市党部委员李正中说：“过去我们走的是背叛人民的道路，现在只有加强学习，才能接近真理，彻底转变。”前蒋记辽北省府秘书、十五年的老国民党员吕世第，在陈述蒋介石从抗战到现在的卖国行为后、提议用被解放军人名义，通电全国，控诉蒋介石的卖国罪状。
