Anniversary Message
　　——A Record of the Tea Party Celebrating the Newspaper's Anniversary

　　On the tea party held on the occasion of the newspaper's anniversary (May 15th), Comrade Pan Shi, the newspaper's president, and other comrades sincerely sought opinions from the attendees regarding the newspaper. The atmosphere at the meeting was harmonious and lively, with free and easy conversation. The opinions offered were very pertinent and greatly helpful in improving the newspaper's editorial and communication work. We have now compiled and published the minutes of the meeting.　　——Editor

　　　      
    Comrade Lu Li said: I saw in the newspaper that the "cutting the chives" mentality is very serious. I just returned from Lucheng, and I heard from the responsible comrades there that this mentality is a minority view in Lucheng, not universal. Establishing a family and building a career, getting rich, is the general thinking of the emancipated peasants. Is it appropriate that the newspaper has not vigorously promoted getting rich? This still needs to be studied.
    Comrade Zhao Shuli said: The situation varies from place to place. When cutting off the feudal vestiges, where the interests of the middle peasants are harmed, the "cutting the chives" mentality will arise; where the interests of the middle peasants are not harmed, there will be less, perhaps none.
    Director Yuan Zhihe of the Border Region Government said: The "cutting the chives" mentality is mainly the old middle peasant thinking. The emancipated peasants strongly demand to get rich. In old areas with labor heroes and new rich peasants, the "cutting the chives" mentality will be less. In new areas without examples of getting rich through labor, the "cutting the chives" mentality will be more serious. However, this mentality can be gradually overcome after entering the production movement and the land rights are stabilized.
    Then Director Yuan talked about his opinions on the newspaper. He excitedly said: The content of the newspaper is much richer than before, and the guiding role is also much stronger. Good communications in the newspaper can influence the actions of hundreds of thousands of people, making them jump up after reading it. For example, the communication "Ideological Leadership of New Soldiers" is a thoroughgoing mass line. It does not strike at anyone but leads all kinds of soldiers, making everyone very energetic. This typical leadership method has so much guiding significance for us in leading new soldiers! The communication on resolving the relationship between cadres and the masses in Yetao Town is also a typical leadership method. It starts with praising merit, inspires consciousness, and makes the cadres naturally move towards revolutionization. It is not like some villages that do not praise merit, but first smear black, wiping the cadres down, wiping them into a black mass. If you wipe like that, it will affect the emotions of more than one million district and village cadres. Therefore, the newspaper should greatly promote the positive aspects and avoid negative factors in its guidance. I love to read the communication about "Jiyuan's Second Du Balian" in the Taiyue area. It gradually developed from a few people, slowly forming a guerrilla team, establishing a guerrilla base, and engaging in an unyielding struggle against the enemy. This is a great event! This short communication has such a great guiding effect on comrades working behind enemy lines! In the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, I led a guerrilla team myself, but I wouldn't have done it like this. This is not a simple matter! Now some comrades only want to see news of great victories, not small news of guerrilla activities and development, which is not good.
    Comrade Wang Chun said: Many war reports and local news are just piles of dry numbers, which are boring and tasteless. Some communications still have flesh and blood, and it is exciting to read. Can't the news and communications be written together?
    After pointing out the achievements of the newspaper, Wang Zhongqing put forward several opinions: 1. International news does not reflect the dynamics of the colonial liberation movement and the democratic movement, and improvements should be made in the future. 2. Some headlines are marked very prominently and vividly, which can attract readers to read them. Some headlines are objectively descriptive, and the guidance is less. 3. The fourth edition has recently been closely integrated with the war, and some work experience on land reform and production movement should be published in the future. 4. The reporting area of communication work should be wider. We write more about the battle process and battle stories, and less about how the soldiers' thinking changes in the battle. There are more simple military reports, and the reporting of political work, such as the political impact of a certain battle, battlefield discipline, and mass work in the war zone, is worse.
    Comrade Cui Xi said: Our newspaper reflects the dynamics of other liberated areas, and uses their work experience to guide the work in our area. I feel that we are doing poorly in this regard. At the same time, there are more reports on general work experience, and fewer reports on guiding work through typical figures and typical deeds.
    Comrade Wang Chun said: In international news reports, we cannot see the trend of the world, and we cannot see the activities of the people of the world moving towards victory. It is not enough to only let readers see right and wrong. We should make everyone see the strength of the world's people and where the world is going, in order to increase confidence in victory.
    Comrade Zhao Shuli said: The recent fourth edition reflects a lot of war, which is well coordinated. But some communications are written in the old way, and they don't taste good. For example, when describing the emotions of the masses in the newly liberated areas, many places say that "if you had come a few days later, we would not have been able to live." There is a lot of suffering for the people in the Chiang-controlled areas, and it should be written from all aspects.
    Comrade Huangmei said: In the reporting aspect, sometimes good things are buried. For example, the "three-in-one" education in the army is a very good thing, which plays a great role, and it should be published well, but it was not published. Some news is handled inappropriately. After the Taiyue troops entered Quwo City, the discipline was so good, but it was not put in a prominent position on the layout. Therefore, I associate it with the issue of the top headline news on the first edition. Is it just to publish war victory news? Sometimes, although a city is liberated, there is another news that is more significant than it, and I think it can also be published as the headline. On the local edition, can we focus on reporting the work of one area to give people a clear impression? There is too little international news on the third edition, and sometimes it is not connected. Some news is read without understanding. The fourth edition should reflect some cultural news and the activities of cultural people. The newspaper's reporting on the contact between various agencies and the coordination of various work is not enough.
    Liu Yangqiao said: At the end of various tasks, there should be a comprehensive report, so that people can understand the whole picture of this stage of work. Too little is reflected in the Chiang-controlled areas (such as democratic movements, civil unrest, etc.).
    Shao Wei said: When I was in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, I saw that the villagers' blackboards and chats were very attentive to national affairs, but now I live in the countryside, and I rarely hear them talk about this thing. In this regard, the newspaper is not closely enough combined with the masses. Strengthening the masses' current affairs education should also be noted.
    Speaking of this, it was already late. Comrade Pan Shi and all the comrades of the newspaper were very satisfied with the opinions raised by everyone. Comrade Pan Shi said: These opinions are very valuable. There are many things that the comrades of the newspaper have not been able to examine after several reviews. Now, based on everyone's opinions, I put forward a few points:
    (1) Special attention should be paid to the issue of the newspaper linking with practical issues. For example, is the "cutting the chives" mentality serious in the old areas or the new areas? Is it among the old middle peasants or someone else? The newspaper's understanding of these ideas is still very general and far from the actual situation. If we do not understand the overall situation and only pay attention to one aspect of the "cutting the chives" mentality without emphasizing the idea of getting rich, then it will be very harmful to the guidance of the work. These must pay attention to investigating the actual situation in various places and understand various problems at any time. The newspaper is the newspaper of tens of millions of people. Posting a message, a sentence, or a word on the newspaper is very important, and we are not allowed to be negligent in the slightest.
    (2) Distinguish between the thinking of the masses and the thinking of the leadership. The leadership's thinking is the concentrated expression of the will of the broad masses. What to advocate and what to oppose must be very clear. The thinking of the masses, some of which is very good and can be vigorously advocated, can become the thinking of the leadership, widely spread, and promote the work. Some of the thinking of the masses is simple and not necessarily comprehensive, and cannot be used in a confused manner. For example, the slogan "wash your face and smear black," we used it in the headline and put it in a prominent position. By marking it like this, the leadership's thinking went wrong. A village cadre criticized correctly, he said: "Washing your face is what Chairman Mao said, we have no opinion; smearing black is a way to treat the personnel of the puppet organization, we do not agree." This is a very good example.
    (3) The issue of the newspaper's format: In the headline aspect, we can truly grasp the essence of the news, and the marks are clear, vivid, and instructive. It does not need to be marked a lot in a lengthy manner. For example, when reflecting the work of filling in the gaps and making up for the deficiencies, there is no need to fill in the gaps on the layout on the left and make up for the deficiencies on the right. More is not refined, it will make people bored. Some of our headlines are indeed too objectively descriptive, especially those headlines that extract a large paragraph from the text, almost writing the entire text, without guidance, and readers do not read the content. In the writing of news, communication can be written vividly, and news should also be written vividly. The most important thing is that every news (especially in terms of local work) must write a vivid and specific process, so that people can see the development of the facts and be able to learn. Only dry numbers and place names will not arouse the interest of readers.
    (4) Reflecting the central work and reflecting the central issue from the side. It is right and necessary for the newspaper to reflect the central work and guide the work, so that the guidance will be powerful. This is the key to ensuring the successful completion of the work. In reflecting the central work, we can report the entire process of the work with typical events and specific examples. This is a very good reporting method, and readers also love to read it. It is actually difficult for the newspaper to publish everything. However, in order to highlight the central work, strengthen the guiding force, and coordinate from all aspects, it is necessary to reflect from the side, and it is also necessary to adopt the experience of foreign areas. For example, our current central work is drought prevention and rush planting. Jin-Sui District also put forward the slogan "drought prevention and rush planting, saving and preparing for famine." Their wording is also very good, and it can be published to enlighten us. For example, reporting on the self-defense war, it is not enough to have simple war reports, and it is necessary to cooperate with battle communications and battle stories. What is particularly important is that the self-defense war is a people's war. The activities of thousands of people supporting the front line are earth-shattering and great scenes, all of which need to be written. In addition, the cooperation with the work of other departments can also be reflected in the central work. For example, now that the newspaper is reporting on the great production movement, the articles written by the comrades of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles on this aspect can be published, and the activities of the cultural troupe promoting production can also be published. By doing this, we can see the activities of the work of various departments, highlight the central work, and adjust the monotony on the layout.

　　周年赠言
  　——本报周年纪念茶会纪实
    本报周年纪念日（五月十五日）茶话会上，本报社长磐石同志及本报同志，诚恳征求到会同志对本报意见。会上，空气和谐活泼，谈笑自若。所提意见，非常中肯，对报纸编辑工作及通讯工作的改进，都有很大帮助。现特将会议记录整理出来，发表于此。　　——编者
　　　      
    鲁藜同志说：在报上看见，反映割韭菜思想很厉害。我刚从潞城回来，听那里负责同志讲，这个在潞城是少数人的思想，不是普遍的，兴室立业、发财致富是翻身农民的普遍思想。报上未大力宣传发家致富，是否合适？还须研究研究。
    赵树理同志说：各地情况不同，割封建尾巴时，那里损伤了中农利益，那里就会引起割韭菜思想，不损伤中农利益的地方就会少些，也许没有。
    边府袁致和厅长说：割韭菜思想，主要是旧中农思想，翻身农民是强烈要求发家致富的。老区有劳动英雄，有新富农，割韭菜思想就会少些。新区没有劳动发家的榜样，割韭菜思想就会严重些。不过这种思想在进入生产运动后，地权稳固了，慢慢可以克服的。
    接着袁厅长就谈对报纸的意见，他兴奋的说：报纸的内容比从前丰富得多了，指导作用也强得多了。报上的好通讯，可以影响几十万人的行动，让他们读了能够跳起来。如《对新战士的思想领导》那篇通讯，是个彻头彻尾的群众路线，他不打击一个人，把各样的战士都领导起来，个个劲头儿很大。这个典型的领导方法，对我们带新兵有多么大的指导作用啊！冶陶镇解决干群关系的通讯，也是篇典型的领导方法。它从表功入手，启发自觉，使干部自自然然的走向革命化。它不像有的村那样，不表功，先擦黑，把干部擦下去，擦成黑漆一团。如果这样擦下去，会影响一百多万区村干部的情绪。因此，报纸在指导上，要大大发扬积极方面，避免消极因素。太岳区“济源第二杜八联”的通讯，我很爱看。他由几个人慢慢儿活动，慢慢成了一支游击队，建立了游击根据地，给敌人不屈不挠的斗争着。这是个了不起的大事啊！这个短短的通讯，对敌后工作同志指导作用多么大啊！抗日战争初期，咱自己也带过游击队，就不会这样搞，这不是个简单事情！现在有些同志，光愿看大胜利消息，不愿看游击队活动、发展的小消息，是不好的。
    王春同志说：战报、地方新闻很多是堆集一些干巴巴的数字，枯燥无味。有些通讯还有血肉，看着还很起劲。把新闻和通讯统一起来写不好？
    王仲青同志指出报纸成绩后，又提出几点意见：一、国际消息上，反映不出殖民地解放运动、民主运动的动态来，今后应加改进。二、标题有的标得很醒目、很生动，能够吸引读者非看不可。有的标题客观性叙述性大，指导性就差一些。三、四版最近与战争结合得很紧，今后应登一些土地改革、生产运动的工作经验。四、通讯工作，报导面要广泛一些，我们写战斗经过、战斗故事多，写战士在战斗中思想如何变化少。单纯的军事报导多，报导政治工作，如某战役的政治影响，战场纪律，战地群众工作等就差一些。
    崔玺同志说：咱们的报纸反映其他解放区的动态，采用他们的工作经验，来指导本区工作，我感到做得差些。同时，报导一般工作经验多，通过典型人物典型事迹来指导工作的报导还少。
    王春同志说：国际消息报导上，看不出世界的趋势，看不出世界人民走向胜利的活动。只让读者看出是非，是不够的，应该使大家看出世界人民力量的强大，世界走向那里去，以增加胜利信心。
    赵树理同志说：最近四版上反映战争多，配合得好。可是有的通讯写成老一套了，看起来没啥味道。像描写新解放区群众的情绪，好多地方都是老太太说：“你们再晚来几天，俺们就不能活了。”蒋管区人民的痛苦很多，从各方面去写才好。
    荒煤同志说：在报导方面，有时候把好的东西埋没了。如部队上“三合一”教育，是个很好的东西，起作用很大，应该好好的登一下，可是没有登。有的消息处理不恰当，太岳部队进入曲沃城后，纪律那样良好，但在版面上没有把它放到显著地位。因此，我联想到关于一版上头条消息的问题，是否光登战争胜利消息？有时候，虽然解放了一座城，但同时又有其他的一个消息比他更有重大意义，我看也可登头条。地方版上，是否可以集中报导一个地区的工作，给人以明确的印象？三版上国际消息太少，有时还接连不上，有些消息看了不摸头脑。四版对文化消息和文化人的活动应反映一些。报纸对各机关联系和各种工作配合报导还不够。
    刘仰桥同志说：各种工作告一段落时，应有一个综合报导，使人对这一段工作可以了解全貌。蒋管区的东西反映的太少了（如民主运动，民变情形等）。
    邵伟同志说：我在陕甘宁边区，看到那里乡村黑板报，老百姓闲谈，很注意国家大事，而现在我住的乡村，很少听到他们谈这个东西，在这一点上，报纸和群众结合还不够。加强群众的时事教育还应注意。
    谈到这里，时间已经不早，磐石同志和本报所有同志对于大家所提意见，感到十分满意。磐石同志说：这些意见很宝贵，有很多报馆同志几次检讨，也没检讨出来。现在，我根据大家意见，提出几点：
    （一）报纸联系实际问题，要特别注意。如割韭菜思想，究竟是老区严重呢，还是新区？是旧中农有呢，还是其他什么人？报馆对这些思想的了解，还非常笼统，和实际情况距离还远。如果对全面情况不了解，只注意了割韭菜思想的一面，而不强调发家致富的思想，那对工作指导就非常有害了。这些就须要注意调查各地的实际情况，随时了解各种问题。报纸是几千万人的报纸，报上登一条消息，一句话，一个字，关系都很重大，不允许我们有丝毫马虎。
    （二）把群众思想和领导思想区别开来。领导思想是广大群众意志的集中表现，提倡什么、反对什么，要能十分明确。群众思想，有的很好，可以大力提倡，就可成为领导思想，广泛的传播出去，推动工作。有的群众思想，是朴素的，还不一定全面，不能合混采用。如洗脸擦黑口号，我们曾把它用标题标出来，登到显著地位，这样一标，就成了领导思想出了毛病。某村干部批评的对，他说：洗脸是毛主席说的，我们没啥意见；擦黑是对待伪组织人员的办法，我们不赞成。这是很好的例子。
    （三）报纸形式问题：在标题方面能真正抓住新闻的精髓，标得明确、生动，有指导性，不在连篇累牍的标得多，如反映填平补齐工作，不需要在版面上左一个填平，右一个补齐。多而不精，就会使人生厌。我们有的标题，确是客观性叙述性太大了，尤其是那样的标题，摘录文内一大段，几乎把全文都写出来了，没有指导性，读者也不看内容了。在写新闻方面，通讯能写得生动，新闻也应该写生动，顶要紧的是，每一条新闻（尤其是地方工作方面的），必须写出生动的具体过程，使人看出事实的发展，能够学习。只有干巴巴的数字和人名地名，不会引起读者们的兴趣。
    （四）反映中心工作与侧面反映中心问题。报纸反映中心工作，指导工作，这是对的，也必须这样做，指导才会有力。这是保证胜利完成工作的关键。在反映中心工作中，可以用典型事件、具体事例报导全部工作的过程。这是很好的报导方法，读者也很爱看。要想凡事都登，报纸实际上有它的困难。不过为了突出中心工作，加强指导力量，从各方面配合，和从侧面反映都是必要的，采用外区经验，也很必要。如目前我们中心工作是防旱抢种，晋绥区也提出“防旱抢种，节约备荒”口号，人家的提法又很好，可以刊出，启示我们。又如报导自卫战争，光有简单的战报是不够的，需要有战斗通讯、战斗故事配合。特别重要的，自卫战争是人民战争，千千万万人民支援前线的活动，都是惊天动地的伟大场面，都需要写。此外，和其他部门工作的配合，也可在中心工作反映上来配合。如现在报纸报导大生产运动，文联同志写的关于这方面的文章，就可以登，文工团演剧推动生产的活动也可以登。这样做，既可看出各部门工作的活动，又可突出中心工作，调剂版面上的单调。
