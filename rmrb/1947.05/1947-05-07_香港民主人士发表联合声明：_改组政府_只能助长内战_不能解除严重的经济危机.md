Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th: The Hong Kong "Hua Shang Bao" reports: Prominent Kuomintang members Li Ji-shen, He Xiangning, Cai Tingkai, etc., Democratic League members Peng Zemin, etc., National Salvation Association members Li Zhangda, Chen Cisheng, leaders of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party Li Boqiu, Guo Guanjie, and many others, recently issued a joint statement expressing their attitude towards the Chinese government's "reorganization." The statement said: "Such a government reorganization cannot solve any problems in China, but can only fuel civil war and increase the suffering of the people. Such a government reorganization cannot guide China towards democracy in the slightest. On the contrary, it uses the guise of 'democracy' to conceal the Kuomintang's one-party dictatorship. Regardless of the fact that Kuomintang members still occupy an overwhelming majority in the National Government, we believe that the China Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party, which have been invited to participate in the government, cannot represent China's true liberals; in fact, true liberals are now suffering arrest, imprisonment, and persecution by secret agents. Such a government reorganization is clearly and extremely contrary to the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference." The statement also said: "Establishing such a government cannot guarantee peace, and aims to obtain American loans to continue the civil war. Such a new government cannot resolve the current serious economic crisis." The statement concluded: "In short, the reorganized government now is essentially still a one-party dictatorship of the Kuomintang. The participation of the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party in this government only serves as a smokescreen for the one-party government. From now on, one-party dictatorship and civil war will continue as they are now, and everything will remain unchanged. We have no illusions about this 'reorganized government' and are willing to jointly oppose it with our patriotic compatriots."

　　香港民主人士发表联合声明：
    “改组政府”只能助长内战  不能解除严重的经济危机
    【新华社陕北四日电】香港华商报称：著名之国民党员李济琚何香凝、蔡廷楷等，民主同盟人士彭泽民等，救国会人士李章达、陈此生，农工民主党领袖李伯球、郭冠杰，及其他多人，顷发表联合声明，对于中国政府之“改组”表明态度。该声明称：“这样的政府改组，不能解决中国任何问题，只能助长内战，增加人民之痛苦。这样的政府改组，丝毫不能引导中国走向民主。反之，是用“民主”的外衣，掩盖国民党的一党专政。姑不论在事实上国民党员在国民政府内仍占压倒多数，我们认为，被邀请参加政府的中国青年党和民社党，也不能代表中国真正的自由主义者；事实上，真正的自由主义者现在正遭受特务之逮捕、监禁和迫害。这样的政府改组是和政协决议显然极端背谬的。”该声明又说：“建立这样的政府，不能保证和平，旨在获得美国贷款，以继续内战。这样的新政府是不能解除当前严重的经济危机的。”该声明在结论里说：“总而言之，现在改组的政府，本质上仍是国民党一党专政的政府。青年党和民社党参加这个政府，徒供作一党政府的烟幕而已。从今以后，一党专政、内战将如现在一样继续下去，一切均将毫无改变。我们对此‘改组的政府’，不存任何幻想，并愿与我爱国同胞共同反对之。”
