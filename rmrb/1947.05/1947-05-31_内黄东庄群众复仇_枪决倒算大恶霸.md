　　Neihuang Dongzhuang Masses Take Revenge
  　Big Bully Who Reversed Settlements Executed
    [Our newspaper's report from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area on the 29th] After Neihuang was recovered, the masses rose up to take revenge. Zhang Dafa and Zhang Erfa, big bullies from Dongzhuang in the first district, and their parents (a total of four people) immediately went over to the enemy when they came. Their father came forward as the Baozhang (head of the village) and led the landlords to reverse the grain and land settlements. Zhang Dafa relied on his power to rape Luo Wangshi. Because Luo Wangshi's grandmother lived with her, making things inconvenient, Zhang Dafa, Zhang Erfa, and their mother conspired to strangle Luo Wangshi's grandmother, and stripped off her fur coat. Later, Luo Wangshi saw Zhang Dafa's mother wearing her grandmother's fur coat, and then realized the truth, but dared not say anything. Wang Duanshi's only son was also beaten to death by them. Resident Zhang Ping was beaten and injured, and Zhang Jinbao's father was buried alive. They also led the Home Return Team to kidnap five young men in the × area. The entire village held them in utmost hatred. After our army recovered Neihuang, the masses immediately arrested Zhang Dafa's mother and sons, and conducted reasonable liquidation, recovering all the gains. The masses from the surrounding eight villages rushed to tell of their suffering and take revenge, and many people cried bitterly. They unanimously demanded that those who killed people should pay with their lives. The democratic government immediately executed Zhang Dafa's mother and sons by firing squad, which greatly satisfied the people.
