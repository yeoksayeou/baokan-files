　　Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 7th: A frontline reporter's summary of the military situation on the main battlefield in East China states: In the ten days since the start of the East China People's Liberation Army's summer counter-offensive (April 22nd to May 1st), the cities of Tai'an and Ningyang were recovered, over 30,000 Chiang troops were annihilated, and over 300,000 Chiang troops attempting to divide the Yimeng Mountains by invading Mengyin and Xintai were forced into a passive position, taking beatings everywhere. In mid-April, Chiang's army concentrated thirteen reorganized divisions on the front line and advanced on the Yimeng Mountains in five routes: one route, with the 74th and 83rd Divisions, attacked northwestward along the highway from Linyi towards Mengyin; one route, with the 25th and 65th Divisions, attacked Mengyin from the north of Feixian; one route, with the 11th and 64th Divisions, attacked Xintai and Mengyin from the east of Yishui; one route, with the 7th and 48th Divisions, attacked from the northeast of Linyi, attempting to spy on Juxian and Yishui; one route, with the 9th, 85th, 75th, and 72nd Divisions, controlled the Zou County to Tai'an section of the Jinpu Railway, with the 5th Army (unreorganized) attacking eastward from Dawenkou, occupying Loude (forty li southeast of Dawenkou), turning south, passing through Sishui eastward, passing through Bianqiao again north, and occupying Shilai, also targeting Xintai and Laiwu. In order to smash Chiang's army's offensive and annihilate the enemy's effective strength, the East China People's Liberation Army, starting on April 22nd, used a portion to blitz the flanks and rear of Chiang's army, capturing the city of Tai'an in one fell swoop, and completely annihilating over 20,000 troops from three brigades of Chiang's 72nd Division. On the 28th, the city of Ningyang on the west side of the Jinpu Railway was recovered, annihilating over 1,000 Chiang puppet troops from Wu Huawen's unit. At the same time, another unit resisted the invading Chiang troops in Shangye, Zhuman, Baimaguan, Heishan and other places on the eastern and southwestern foothills of Mount Meng, fighting fiercely for seven days and nights, annihilating 6,000 enemies. After completing their mission, this unit of the People's Liberation Army voluntarily withdrew from the cities of Mengyin and Xintai on the 28th and 29th. On the 30th, a unit of the People's Liberation Army inserted itself into the enemy's rear, recovering Difang, Tongshi, Taipingyi, Bianqiao and other places between Feixian and Sishui on the Lin (yi) Zi (yang) Highway. From April 29th to May 1st, another unit counterattacked Qingtuo Temple and other places on the Lin (yi) Meng (yin) Highway, annihilating two regiments of Chiang's 83rd Division. In addition to killing and wounding, over 3,500 were captured alive, and three new American-supplied flamethrowers given to Chiang Kai-shek were seized. During the same period, the People's Liberation Army under General Liu Bocheng and the local armed forces of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area continuously recovered seven cities, including Feicheng and Pingyin, providing strong support to East China. Chiang's army was overwhelmed and exposed its embarrassment. In particular, the victory at Tai'an shattered Chiang's plot to open the Jinpu Railway and divide the two major liberated areas of Shandong and Hebei-Shandong-Henan, making Jinan once again a dead city. After the capture of Ningyang, Chiang's army's large supply depot in Ziyang (Yanzhou) in the central section of the Jinpu Railway was also seriously threatened. Chiang's 75th and 85th Divisions huddled in the Dawenkou area, and the 5th Army had to rush back day and night to reinforce. Chiang's army, which had advanced northeast from Linyi to the Heyang (80 li southwest of Yishui) and Tingshui (56 li southwest of Juxian) line, was also forced to hurriedly transfer west to reinforce Qingtuo Temple. The four divisions of Chiang's army, the 11th, 74th, 25th, and 65th, which had invaded the Mengyin and Xintai areas, were deeply afraid of being annihilated and huddled in the mountainous area west of the Linmeng Highway, in a dilemma of advancing or retreating. The People's Liberation Army's victorious offensive is continuing to develop.
    Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 6th: Guerrilla blasting operations in Mengshan and other counties are being vigorously carried out along the points and lines occupied by Chiang's army. In twenty days in April, the Mengshan County Armed Work Team and militiamen killed and captured 68 Chiang soldiers and "Homecoming Corps" members, seized two light machine guns, two Thompson submachine guns, and more than ten rifles. The Wang Fayuan blasting team in Fangcheng and other places laid mines eight times, killing seven enemies and wounding three, and fought more than twenty times, killing, wounding, and capturing eight Chiang army "Homecoming Corps" members. The Renyizhuang militia team used deceptive tactics during the anti-encirclement campaign. Wherever Chiang's army went, gunshots and whistles were heard from all the mountains, forcing them to flee in panic. In Zhao Village and other areas of Tai'an County, a movement to dismantle bridges, destroy roads, and transform the terrain has been launched.

    我迫三十万蒋军处于被动  敌打通津浦路阴谋已破灭
    【新华社华东前线七日电】前线记者综述华东正面战场军事形势称：华东人民解放军夏季反击攻势开始十天（四月二十二日至五月一日），光复泰安、宁阳二城，歼蒋军三万余，迫使进犯蒙阴、新泰企图分割沂蒙山区之三十余万蒋军趋于被动，到处挨打。四月中旬，蒋军集结十三个整编师于第一线，分五路进犯沂蒙山区：一路以七四、八三两师，自临沂向西北沿公路进攻蒙阴；一路以二十五、六五两师，自费县北攻蒙阴；一路以十一、六四两师自沂水东犯新泰、蒙阴；一路以七、四八两师自临沂东北犯，图窥莒县、沂水；一路以九、八五、七五、七二等四个师，控制津浦路邹县至泰安段，以第五军（未整编）由大汶口东犯占楼德（大汶口东南四十里），折而南，经泗水向东，经卞桥复北，进占石莱，亦以新泰莱芜为目标。华东人民解放军为粉碎蒋军进攻，歼敌有生力量，四月二十二日起，以一部闪击蒋军之侧背，一举攻克泰安城，全歼蒋军七二师三个旅二万余众。二十八日收复津浦路西侧宁阳城，歼蒋伪军吴化文部千余。另一部于同时在蒙山东麓及西南麓上冶、诸满、白马关、黑山等地抗击进犯蒋军，奋战七昼夜，歼敌六千。该部解放军于达成任务后，二十八、二十九两日主动撤出蒙阴、新泰两城。三十日，解放军一部插蒋军腹背，收复临（沂）滋（阳）公路上费县、泗水间之地方、铜石、太平邑、卞桥等地。另一部于二十九日至五月一日反击临（沂）蒙（阴）公路上之青驼寺等地，歼灭蒋军八三师两个团，除毙伤外，生俘三千五百余，并掳获美帝国主义赐予蒋介石之新武器喷火器三具。同时期内，刘伯承将军所部人民解放军及冀鲁豫地方武装连续收复肥城、平阴等七城，予华东以有力配合。蒋军顾此失彼，窘态毕露。特别是泰安之捷，破灭了蒋军打通津浦路分割山东、冀鲁豫两大解放区的阴谋，使济南复成一座死城。宁阳攻克后，津浦中段蒋军大屯兵站滋阳（兖州）亦遭严重威胁。蒋军七五、八五两师蜷缩于大汶口地区，第五军不得不星夜兼程回师增援。自临沂向东北进至河阳（沂水西南八十里）、汀水（莒县西南五十六里）一线之蒋军，亦被迫仓慌西调增援青驼寺。侵入蒙阴、新泰地区之蒋军十一、七四、二十五、六五等四个师深惧被歼，紧缩于临蒙公路西侧山地，进退维谷。解放军的胜利攻势，刻正继续发展中。
    【新华社山东六日电】蒙山等县游击爆炸运动正在蒋军侵占点线猛烈开展。蒙山县武工队与民兵四月份二十天内毙俘蒋军与还乡团六十八名，缴获轻机枪两挺、汤姆式冲锋枪两支，步枪十余支。该县王法元爆炸队在放城等地埋雷八次，毙敌七名，伤三名，并作战二十余次，毙伤俘蒋军“还乡团”八名。仁义庄民兵队在反清剿时，大摆迷魂阵，蒋军所到之处，各山枪声哨声大作，迫使狼狈逃窜。泰安县赵庄等区则掀起拆桥破路改造地形运动。
