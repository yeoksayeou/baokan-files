Xinhua News Agency, Zhengtai Front, 7th: The Frontline Field Headquarters has just issued its fourth operational communique stating: On April 30th, a unit of our army cut off the railway between Yangquan and Shouyang, leaving the Yan puppet 33rd Army's 71st Division, Provisional 46th Division (missing one regiment), Independent 10th Column, Shanxi Security 4th Regiment and part of the Security 24th Regiment, Security 5th Battalion (Japanese soldiers retained by Yan Xishan, battalion commander was Fujita), and the Yangquan and Pingding military police, etc., completely isolated. The enemy, except for the Japanese Security 5th Battalion defending Lion Mountain southwest of Yangquan, broke out to the west on the 1st. On the 2nd, our army annihilated the enemy guarding Lion Mountain and liberated Yangquan. The troops that broke out to the west were surrounded by us in the area south of Dongxiguo Village and Qinquan (Qinquan is east of Shouyang) southwest of Meng County. After three days of fierce fighting, we completely annihilated them on the 4th. Another unit of our army counterattacked Shouyang, first recovering the Mashou Railway Station southwest of Shouyang. The Shouyang defenders abandoned the city in panic and fled west, and our army liberated the city of Shouyang on the 3rd (previous telegram incorrectly stated the 4th). Preliminary statistics of the battle show that over 10,000 enemies were annihilated, including 8,000 captured and 400 Japanese soldiers. Detailed results are still being tallied. The more than 300-li railway line from west of Huolu to Mashou Railway Station is completely under our control. The three major coal and iron mining areas of Jingxing, Yangquan, and Huangdangou (northwest of Shouyang) are all in our hands.
Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 7th: A frontline reporter reports that on the night of April 28th, a unit of the Jin-Cha-Ji People's Liberation Army captured Yan's army's "Flying Dragon" armored train between Baiyangshu and Yangquan on the Zhengtai line: At about 10 pm that night, our army had just destroyed the railway section from Yangquan to Baiyangshu when the enemy's "Flying Dragon" armored train came from Baiyangshu, attempting to escape to Yangquan. It was fiercely attacked by our artillery fire and fled back in a panic, but was intercepted by our western troops. Both locomotives were destroyed first. Six carriages could not move. The enemy attempted to resist stubbornly relying on the carriages. People's warrior Guo Hua, the platoon leader of the 5th Company's 1st Platoon, climbed onto the roof and threw more than 20 hand grenades into the chimney. All the more than 50 Yan soldiers in the carriage were either killed or captured. According to the prisoners, Yan Xishan has a total of five broad-gauge armored trains, and the "Flying Dragon" is the largest, with steel armor about half an inch thick.
