  　A Signal of a New Upsurge in the Workers' Movement

    The intense struggle between progress and reaction in the post-war world was universally manifested in all important capitalist countries on this year's May Day. In New York, tens of thousands of members of the CIO and AFL shouted the slogan "Fight for Peace and Democracy," condemned Truman's reactionary plan to "aid" Greece, demanded US-Soviet friendship, and opposed the anti-labor bill under consideration in Congress; in Tokyo, 700,000 workers marched, demanding the strengthening of the worker-peasant united front; in France, more than one million workers held a grand demonstration to "defend republican freedom"; the British Trades Union Congress called on global labor organizations to "reaffirm loyalty to international solidarity and lead the movements of their respective groups to defeat the unconquered reactionary forces that aim to rule through imperialism and capitalist exploitation of labor"; in The Hague, 120,000 people demonstrated, demanding the withdrawal of Dutch troops from Indonesia; in Brussels, banners carried by 40,000 marchers read: "We advocate peace," "Down with Spanish Fascism," "Foreign interventionists get out of Greece"; in Berlin, a continuous stream of demonstrators shouted: "Demand peace and friendship between nations!" "Demand the expulsion of Nazis and reactionaries from the economic and political spheres!"

    The May Day demonstrations are a signal of a new upsurge in the workers' movement in the world, especially in Europe. They indicate that the working classes of various countries, highly awakened by the war, are gathering strength to resist the attacks of international reactionary forces headed by American reactionaries. The characteristics of the new workers' movement in Western Europe are the close integration of urgent economic struggles with political struggles against domestic reactionaries. In Italy, reactionaries killed eight workers on May Day, triggering an unprecedented political general strike of six million workers. The French General Confederation of Labor, with more than five million members, is leading a wage increase movement and is rising up to wage a serious struggle against French reactionaries. The working class in the capitalist world still faces arduous struggles, but it can be determined that the consciousness and unity of the working class will continue to strengthen, and the difficulties they face will certainly not be greater than the difficulties of the reactionaries in various countries. The real difficulty lies with the reactionaries in various countries, who can neither solve the people's problems nor escape their own crises, but can only force the workers and people to become more and more revolutionary day by day.

　  The Growth of the French Political Crisis

    A political crisis is growing in France, a crisis caused by the Lamartine government's embrace of the reactionary forces and the forced withdrawal of the French Communist Party from the government. If the Lamartine government had relied on the support of the Communist Party and the left wing of the Socialist Party, it could have had a solid social foundation to solve the serious difficulties facing France. However, the Lamartine group, representing the right wing of the Socialist Party, chose the opposite path.

    The Lamartine government betrayed the interests of the French nation and people and surrendered to the American and British reactionaries. This is most blatantly demonstrated in France's policy towards Germany. On the German issue, and in solving the problem of Ruhr coal, which France urgently needed, Lamartine signed the Anglo-American-French coal agreement. This agreement abandoned the principle of four-power joint control of the Ruhr, which France had already agreed to at the Moscow conference, and agreed to the unilateral control of the Ruhr by Britain and the United States. When the Lamartine government became a servant of the American and British reactionaries on diplomatic issues, it naturally also became a servant of French monopoly capital on domestic issues. When Lamartine first came to power, under the pressure of the broad masses of workers' demands for wage increases, he ordered a 5% reduction in prices. During his four months in office, prices were 738% of those in 1939, while wages were 400% of what they were then; the capitalists' profits exceeded three times the pre-war level, while the workers' demands for wage increases were rejected. Lamartine's actions were condemned by the Communist Party; his response was "unwilling to change a single word in the January 21st statement on price and wage policy." Since Lamartine adopted such an extremely reactionary attitude on this major issue directly related to the entire French working people, he could not but force the French Communist Party, which represents the interests of the French people, to withdraw from the government. The Lamartine government showed an even more ferocious imperialist face on the issues of Vietnam and Madagascar. Lamartine came to power when the war in Vietnam was tense, but he neither ordered a ceasefire nor continued peace talks, but increased the number of troops and intensified the offensive against the Vietnamese people, regardless of France's serious lack of manpower and financial resources. According to official figures, the number of French troops sent to Vietnam has reached 115,000, more than double the number sent to Germany. Lamartine also implemented armed conquest against the local people and French in Madagascar who were striving for democratic rights. Due to the complete adoption of imperialist policies on colonial and international diplomacy, his Minister of Finance, Souman, included military expenditures accounting for 61% of the national budget he made not long ago.

    As the political reaction in France intensified, the interference of the American and British reactionaries in French internal affairs became increasingly overt. After Churchill came to France and was awarded the highest French military medal, Bullitt, a confidant of former US Ambassador to Vichy Leahy and a close friend of de Gaulle, also arrived in France. When the French Communist Party withdrew from the government, the American reactionaries immediately loaned 250 million yuan to Lamartine through the international banks they controlled. Even so, the Lamartine government's disaster is far from over. The withdrawal of the French Communist Party from the government did not alleviate but aggravated Lamartine's difficulties. Because, as French Communist leader Duclos said: "Without the Communist Party in France, nothing important can be done." The Lamartine government's foundation within the French Socialist Party has also been severely weakened. It barely obtained the continued support of the Socialist Party Congress with a very small majority. However, the serious domestic and international economic and political situation facing France is definitely continuing to worsen, and the Lamartine government is resolutely unable to cope with this situation. The French political crisis is continuing to grow.

  　The Dim Future of the "Truman Doctrine"

    The "Truman Doctrine" is the general name of the current American reactionaries' ideology and policy. It is extremely reactionary and extremely fragile. The introduction of the "Aid to Greece and Turkey Act" on March 12 was the first clear shot fired by the Truman Doctrine. At that time, the American reactionaries once thought that they could frighten the Soviet Union and the world's democratic forces at the Moscow Conference, but this attempt failed. Only two months have passed since this "doctrine" was introduced, and it has encountered strong opposition at home and abroad, so that it has had to undergo a "revision." A United Press Washington dispatch on the 10th stated: "The US government is striving to shift the emphasis of the Truman Doctrine to an economic plan for rebuilding Europe and the Far East as healthy democratic areas, rather than a crusade against communism." This "doctrine" changed so quickly because it was opposed by the world's democratic forces and the broad masses of the American people. The division within the American bourgeoisie caused by this is also very obvious. When voting on the "Aid to Greece and Turkey Act," those who voted against it accounted for more than 25% in the Senate, and even more in the House of Representatives, accounting for 27%. Wallace, the representative of the left wing of the bourgeoisie, and American progressive Senator Pepper, both firmly announced that two-thirds of the American people opposed the "Truman Doctrine." At the same time, the American reactionaries themselves also admitted that the result of deliberately publicizing the "communist threat" also caused the masses under their influence to lose confidence in the American reactionaries. Of course, the so-called "shift in emphasis" only represents the posture of the American reactionaries, and does not change any essence. The political significance of the Truman Doctrine is to tighten the oppression and exploitation of the people by extending the government's wartime economic control rights domestically, and to expand the scope of aggression by "saving" the reactionaries of various countries abroad. And its overall direct goal is to escape the crisis.

    In order to escape the economic crisis, the American bourgeoisie has to lend money abroad; there are two ways to do this: one is Wallace's method, who proposed a ten-year, 150 billion yuan foreign loan plan, advocating large loans to the Soviet Union, which is a continuation of Roosevelt's international cooperation policy; the other is the so-called "Truman Doctrine," which only lends money to the reactionaries of various countries and refuses to lend money to the Soviet Union and the world's democratic countries, which is a plan to split the world. The latter type of loan now takes the following forms: so-called military loans (such as those loaned to Greece and Turkey), political loans (such as those planned to be loaned to Korea and Chiang Kai-shek in China), relief loans (such as the 350 million yuan under discussion to replace the UN plan), etc.; no matter what form is adopted, this type of loan is attached with political conditions. The general condition is that the detailed use of all loans must be reviewed and approved by the US delegation sent to that country; the special conditions are to grant the United States special privileges or allow its special requirements. The former is like allowing the United States to send a special mission to Greece and Turkey, and the latter is like requiring the French Lamartine government to continue in power without the leadership of the Communist Party. The wishful thinking of the American reactionaries is to lend out 5 billion yuan annually in the above manner, achieving the dual goals of escaping the crisis and expanding aggression. However, although the American reactionaries' dream is beautiful, it is ultimately a dream; its ending in China is a very good example. The result of the American reactionaries' 4 billion yuan "aid" to Chiang Kai-shek has not alleviated Chiang Kai-shek's crisis in the slightest, but has deepened Chiang Kai-shek's crisis; and its capital is in danger of being completely lost! In fact, not only have the American progressives made pessimistic predictions about the Truman Doctrine, but Truman himself has also expressed a loss of confidence in avoiding the crisis. On May 15, when commenting on an economist's speculation that the United States would experience an economic collapse in three to five months, Truman said: "If the people use good sense and do not allow greedy people to control the necessities, they will not suddenly shift from prosperity to collapse." But isn't the essence of the so-called "Truman Doctrine" to make "greedy people control the necessities" in the United States and many other countries? The Truman Doctrine can never save the collapse of the international reactionaries, just as it can never eliminate the revolutionary movements of various countries.

　　国际述评
  　工人运动新高潮的信号
    战后世界进步与反动的紧张斗争，在今年五一劳动节普遍表现于所有重要的资本主义国家。在纽约数万产联与劳联的会员们叫出“为和平民主而斗争”的口号，谴责杜鲁门“援助”希腊的反动计划，要求美苏友好，反对国会研讨中的反劳工法案；在东京七十万游行工人，要求加强工农联合阵线；法国百余万工人举行“保卫共和自由”的大示威；英国总工会吁请全球的劳工组织，“重申对国际团结之忠诚，领导各该团体之运动，俾能击败以帝国主义统治及资本家剥削劳工为目的而尚未被征服之反动势力”；海牙十二万人示威，要求荷军自印尼撤退；布鲁塞尔四万人游行的旗帜上，写着：“我们主张和平”，“打倒西班牙法西斯主义”，“外国干涉者从希腊滚出去”；柏林的川流不息的示威者，则高喊：“要求各国间的和平与友谊！”“要求自经济界、政治界中驱逐纳粹与反动分子！”
    五一节的示威，是世界特别是欧洲工人运动的新高潮的信号，它表示为战争所教育的高度觉悟了的各国工人阶级，正在集合力量，来抵抗以美国反动派为首的国际反动势力的进攻。西欧新工人运动的特点，就是迫切的经济斗争与反对国内的反动派的政治斗争密切结合。意大利反动派在五一节枪杀了八名工人，激起了空前的六百万工人的政治总罢工。拥有五百余万会员的法国总工会所领导的增资运动，正奋起与法国反动派作严重的斗争。资本主义世界的工人阶级面前还有艰苦的斗争，但是可以断定，工人阶级的觉悟和团结，将要继续增强，而且他们面前的困难决不会比各国反动派的困难更大。真正困难的乃是各国反动派，他们既不能解决人民的问题，也不能逃脱自己的危机，而只能迫使工人和人民一天比一天更加革命化。
　  法国政治危机的增长
    政治危机正在法国增长，这个危机是由于拉马第政府投向反动派的怀抱、迫使法国共产党退出政府而引起的。拉马第政府如果依靠共产党和社会党左翼的支持，本来可以有一个巩固社会的基础，来解决法国面对着的严重困难。但是，代表社会党右翼的拉马第集团，却选择了相反的道路。
    拉马第政府背叛法国民族和人民的利益，而投降美英反动派，这在法国对德国问题所采取的政策上，表现的最为露骨。在德国问题上，在解决法国最急需的鲁尔煤炭问题上，拉马第签订了美英法煤炭协定。这个协定抛弃了法国在莫斯科会议已经同意的四强共管鲁尔的原则，同意了英美对鲁尔的片面管制。当拉马第政府在外交问题上成为美英反动派的仆从时，它在国内问题上当然也成为法国独占资本的仆从。拉马第刚上台的时候，在广大工人的增资要求之下，曾经下令压低物价百分之五。在他当政的四个月中，物价是一九三九年的百分之七百三十八，而工资则为当时的百分之四百；资本家的利润超过了战前的三倍，而工人阶级的增资要求却受到拒绝。拉马第的这种举措，受到共产党的谴责；他的回答是“不愿改变正月二十一日关于物价与工资政策声明中的一个字”。拉马第对这个直接关系全法国劳动人民的重大问题，既然采取如此极端反动的态度，就不能不迫使代表法国人民利益的法国共产党退出了政府。拉马第政府对于越南问题和马达加斯加问题上，更是一派帝国主义的凶恶面目。拉马第正当越南战事吃紧的时候上台，但他既不下令停战，甚至也不继续和谈，而不顾法国人力财力的严重缺乏，增派军队加紧进攻越南人民。法国派到越南去的军队，据官方数字，已达十一万五千人；比派到德国去的多一倍还不止。拉马第对马达加斯加争取民主权利的本地人和法国人，也是实行武力征服。由于对殖民地和国际外交完全采取帝国主义政策，他的财政部长苏曼不久以前所作的国家预算中，军费竟占百分之六十一。
    随着法国政治反动的加剧，美英反动派对法国内政的干涉也就日益表面化了。在邱吉尔来到法国并被颁授法国最高军事勋章以后，美国前驻维希大使李海的亲信和戴高乐的密友布立特也到了法国。当法共退出政府以后，美国反动派马上经过他们把持的国际银行对拉马第贷款二万五千万元。虽然如此，拉马第政府的灾难还远没有解除，法共退出政府不是解除了而是加重了拉马第的困难。因为如同法共领袖杜克洛所说：“在法国没有共产党，就作不出任何重要的事。”拉马第政府在法国社会党内的基础也严重地削弱了。它仅仅以相差极小的比较多数，勉强得到了社会党大会的继续支持。而法国面临着的国内外的严重经济政治局势，却是确定地继续严重化，拉马第政府决然无能应付这个局势，法国政治危机正在继续增长着。
  　“杜鲁门主义”的黯淡前途
    “杜鲁门主义”是目前美国反动派思想政策的总名称，它是极端反动的，也是极端脆弱的。三月十二日“援助希土法案”的提出，就是杜鲁门主义旗帜鲜明的第一炮。当时美国反动派曾经以为可以吓倒莫斯科会议上的苏联与世界民主势力，但这个企图失败了。这个“主义”问世以来，还只有两个月的时光，在国内外已遇到强大的反对，以致不得不来一个“修正”。合众社华府十日电称：“美政府正努力转移杜鲁门主义之着重点，使其为重建欧洲远东为健全民主区域之经济计划，而不再为对抗共产主义之十字军主义。”这个“主义”改得这样快，是因为受到世界民主势力和美国广大群众的反对。美国资产阶级内部为此而引起的分裂也十分明显，在表决“援助希土法案”时，参院投反对票者占百分之二十五以上，众院更多，占百分之二十七。资产阶级左派的代表华莱士和美国进步参议员泼贝尔，都确定的宣布美国有三分之二的人民反对“杜鲁门主义”。同时，美国反动派自己也承认：故意宣传“共产主义威胁”的结果，也引起了他们影响下群众对美国反动派失去信心。当然，所谓“着重点的转移”，只是表示美国反动派的姿态，而并不是改变任何实质。杜鲁门主义的政治意义，对内是用延长政府战时的经济管制权利以加紧压迫剥削人民，对外是想经过对于世界各国反动派的“拯救”，来扩大侵略范围。而其总的直接目标，就要想要逃脱危机。
    美国资产阶级为了逃避经济危机，不能不向外贷款；这可以有两种办法：一种是华莱士的办法，他提出一个为期十年的一千五百亿元的对外贷款计划，主张以大宗贷款给苏联，这是继于罗斯福的国际合作政策的；另一种就是所谓“杜鲁门主义”，只贷款给各国反动派，不肯贷款给苏联与世界民主国家，这是分裂世界的计划。后一种贷款，现在采取了下面这些形式：有所谓军事贷款（如贷予希土者）、政治贷款（如拟议中之贷予朝鲜、中国蒋介石者）、救济贷款（如讨论中之三亿五千万元代替联总计划）等等；不论采用什么形式，这种贷款都附有政治条件。一般的条件，是所有贷款的详细用途都得经过美国派赴该国代表团的审查与同意；特殊的条件，是给予美国特权或者允许它的特殊要求。前者如应允许美国派遣特别使团赴希土，后者如要求法国拉马第政府不在共产党领导下继续当政等。美国反动派的如意算盘，是在上述方式之下，每年之内贷出五十亿元。达到逃避危机和扩大侵略的两重目的。但是，美国反动派的美梦虽然美妙，终究是梦；它在中国的下场就是很好的例子。美国反动派对蒋介石四十亿元“援助”的结果，丝毫没有减轻蒋介石的危机，反而加深了蒋介石的危机；而它的本钱倒有完蛋的危险！事实上，不仅美国的进步派已经对于杜鲁门主义作了悲观的预言；就是杜鲁门自己也表示了对于避免危机的丧失信心。五月十五日杜鲁门在评论某名经济学家推测美国将于三五个月之间发生经济崩溃时称：“如人民运用良好意识，勿使贪婪人士控制需要品，则不致自兴盛突趋崩溃。”但是所谓“杜鲁门主义”的要点，不正是使美国本国和其他许多国家的“贪婪人士控制需要品”吗？杜鲁门主义决不能挽救国际反动派的崩溃，正如它决不能消灭各国的革命运动一样。
