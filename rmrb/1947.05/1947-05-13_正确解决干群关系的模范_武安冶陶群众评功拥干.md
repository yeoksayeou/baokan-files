A Model of Correctly Resolving Cadre-Mass Relations
　　Wuan Yetao Masses Evaluate Merit and Support Cadres
　　Li Bingjie
　　Yetao Town was formerly a guerrilla area with 808 households and 2,780-odd people. The land leveling and patching-up movement has been going on in Yetao for three or four months, but still, 60% of the masses (including women) do not participate in meetings, and the vast majority of honest farmers do not speak at the meetings. Although some are relatively backward, many are dissatisfied with the incomplete elimination of feudalism in their village, feeling that cadres and activists have turned themselves over, but they themselves have not turned over or have not turned over completely, resulting in great grievances and complaints. The reason for not speaking is the fear that their opinions will not be effective or that they will be rebuffed; and some cadres believe that there are many selfish people among the masses, and it is impossible to have no opinions. It would be too troublesome to solicit the opinions of the masses in everything. Some cadres believe that they have contributed to the masses and should be better off than the masses after liberation. The masses are not as capable as the cadres and should only listen to the cadres. Therefore, the leadership believes that the key to moving the work in Yetao forward lies in mobilizing all the "backward" honest farmers, transforming the work style of the cadres, and improving the cadre-mass relationship. Otherwise, it will be impossible to further mobilize the masses to promote all work.
　　Must first commend merits and talk about model deeds, promote righteousness, and improve the enthusiasm of cadres.
　　Not long after the old year, the work of "washing the faces" of cadres and "untangling knots" between cadres and the masses was carried out, but the method was incorrect and there were no results. The leadership saw that it was not good to start with self-reflection, as it would easily dampen the enthusiasm of the cadres. After several research discussions, the method was changed in a timely manner to first commend merits, compare models, recount grievances, and talk about experiences among the cadres, affirming the merits of the cadres as a basis for them to dare to face their shortcomings squarely.
　　At the beginning of the commendation meeting, when the political director said, "When the enemy was here, I delivered food and messages to the Eighth Route Army every day. When the enemy found out, they threatened me several times. I was afraid to go home, and my wife was also scared and complained, but I still insisted on working despite everything." He was very excited, and everyone was moved. When talking about the advantages of the farmers' association director, everyone said that he had a strong fighting spirit. When he struggled against a landlord in his own family, the masses dared not come forward, and he took the lead to lead the masses. The masses all said that he was a "person who uncovers stone slabs." Everyone also praised the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce for reducing the burden on small vendors, not fearing blows, and not being tempted by profit, clearing up the facts of large stores evading burdens after various difficulties. It was also said that "the militia captain does not put on airs, does not act imposing, and cares about the eating and sleeping of the team members when departing. When fighting, he takes the lead, and all the militia members can be tensely united around him." When militia member Gui Xi set off, his mother said with a smile, "As long as the captain is there, I am at ease." The deputy village chief said, "During the worst days of the locust plague, I got up to beat the gong every morning without knowing it, leading the people to find ways to fight the locusts." Before he finished speaking, someone snatched to add, "The people are still grateful to the deputy village chief for his great contribution to fighting locusts and saving the disaster." The village chief is a selfless, hardworking, and conscientious model worker. He is good to the masses and has an understanding of the army; one thing that is particularly admirable about him is that he was beaten by a public porter last year, and the masses wanted to retaliate for him, and his mother also complained, but he first examined his own shortcomings, which moved everyone to not mention retaliation, and it was peaceful. The commendation meeting, which lasted for several days, was lively and vivid, and many vivid model deeds influenced and encouraged all the comrades present.
　　The merits and advantages of the cadres, after their own explanations and mutual supplements, established the example of some model cadres and model deeds. Everyone realized that good cadres should have a clear position, be resolute in struggle, be modest and responsible, care for and unite the masses, be able to endure hardship and stand hard work, and not be selfish, etc.
　　Talking about merits encourages the courage to reflect
　　When one's own merits are re-recognized by oneself and understood by the leadership and all comrades; when one recognizes the qualities that a model party member should possess, one spontaneously generates the courage and willingness to examine one's shortcomings, and one naturally uses the model deeds of these model party members to compare oneself, examine oneself, and deeply experience that "washing the face" is to make oneself perfect and add merit to merit, so one happily turns to criticism and self-criticism.
　　A model cadre who is usually considered to have no major shortcomings examined his lack of fighting spirit, the fear of offending people, a "good guy" work style, an unclear class position, and a wavering middle peasant mentality. Because he was afraid of offending people, even good things could not be implemented, and he often offended the masses as a result. A comrade who had participated in the revolution for more than ten years examined the reasons for his separation from the masses, which was that his burden was too heavy. He believed that he was the first revolutionary hero in Yetao Village, so when distributing fruits, he wanted to give the best to himself, forgetting that those who had received the most and longest revolutionary education should do more for the masses. The branch secretary reflected that the reason for not developing a large number of party members and cultivating activists was the fear that it would be difficult to lead if there were too many party members and that his merits would not be obvious if there were too many activists. The criticism meeting was lively and vivid. They reflected on themselves, and the comrades criticized each other, and were responsible for reflecting the opinions of the masses on each comrade. People who had never spoken before scrambled to make suggestions, and comrades who had always felt that meetings were a burden arrived at the meeting early. The relationship between comrades was unprecedentedly harmonious, and they unanimously praised, "The educational effect of the few days of meetings on the comrades is really great, even better than going to several training classes."
　　Encouraged by this upward revolutionary spirit, the most realistic and difficult part—returning the excess fruits—was also carried out smoothly. All the excess fruits, cheap purchases, land borrowed from landlords in the past, and the preservation of the farmers' association that had been forgotten were reported one by one and were willing to return them to the masses. Some comrades even voluntarily donated their spacious houses and land to the farmers' association to help the poor brothers turn themselves over. Everyone felt that they had unloaded their burdens and were very happy.
　　After the internal ideology was clarified, the village political committee was convened. Various non-party village political cadres used the same method and were inspired by the comrades' self-reflection. Various ideological concerns were quickly resolved. Finally, except for one or two who had more shortcomings and one who had insufficient self-reflection for interacting with a special agent's landlord woman, they unanimously requested to conduct self-criticism in front of the masses as soon as possible in order to achieve cadre-mass unity as soon as possible.
　　The above is the preparation process for cadres to commend merits and examine their thoughts. On the one hand, it is to make the cadres' emotions high, excited, and happy. On the other hand, it is to make self-reflection and the return of fruits thorough.
　　Cadres' preliminary self-reflection mobilized honest farmers to cut off feudal tails
　　On the mass side, the most common phenomenon at the beginning was that honest farmers were afraid to speak out their opinions and did not believe that they had the power to transform cadres. Therefore, while the village cadres were commending merits and reflecting on shortcomings, they carried out further work to mobilize the masses. It is impossible to transform the work style of cadres without the entire masses rising up. First, honest farmers' meetings were held to let them examine the village's land leveling and patching-up work from their various grievances of not having turned over completely, let them compare their past poor and painful lives with the lives of landlords and wealthy people, and complain about their sufferings to stimulate their class feelings, and then inspire their enthusiasm for the movement. In just three or four days, seventy or eighty so-called "backward elements" became activists, and through them, more than two hundred honest farmers were connected. At this time, the village cadres already had the courage and preparation for self-reflection, relieved their various concerns, and automatically convened a meeting of new and old activists in the village, explaining that there were shortcomings in the past work, the feudal tails were not cut off thoroughly, the basic masses did not turn over enough, and they were willing to accept criticism, let the masses rise up, and hoped that the activists would lead the entire village to conduct a general inspection of Yetao's work and launch another general mobilization. When the masses already knew that the cadres had changed their attitude and let go of them, they quickly launched a movement to dig air-raid shelters and cut off feudal tails. This movement was the most thorough and in-depth revolution in Yetao Village, and men, women, and children throughout the village were swept into the tide. Dozens of places in the streets and alleys were fighting, and the internal goods dug out were more than all the previous movements combined.
　　After the tail-cutting movement, the masses' awareness and enthusiasm were further improved, and they demanded to untangle knots with the cadres. The work of brewing to untangle knots was carried out in various streets and neighborhoods. The leadership let go of democracy and mobilized the masses to boldly offer suggestions. Although some people among the masses dared to offer suggestions without any concerns, some masses offered suggestions but were still uneasy and not bold, and some masses did not offer suggestions at all. Their main ideological concerns were the fear of retaliation from the cadres. Some honest farmers were afraid that the cadres would not accept their opinions and would stop working. Therefore, they requested the superiors to write a guarantee that the cadres would not retaliate. The above-mentioned concerns hindered the enthusiastic development of the movement, and the masses did not speak universally enough (less than half). However, on the other hand, the attitude of a small number of activists was incorrect. They harbored the psychology of revenge and "taking their place" against the cadres. Therefore, the leadership paid special attention to correctly resolving the cadre-mass relationship and must not let go of a small number of people who were separated from the masses and opposed to the cadres. Instead, they should let go of honest farmers, cultivate new activists, and then let the masses find people with correct ideas and abilities from among the new and old activists to form a leading group to lead this movement.
　　Therefore, a meeting of activists was convened. The leadership stated that they would definitely support the masses and act as their masters, and introduced the village cadres' determination to correct their mistakes. At the same time, it was emphasized that the guarantee should be based on the masses' own strength. After the masses' ideology was clarified, they discussed and proposed a method to elect representatives from the masses to form a guarantee committee to guarantee that the cadres would not retaliate and to supervise the cadres to correct their mistakes and return the excess fruits.
　　After the meeting, the activists went to connect and explain, and held small meetings to brew and mobilize at large meetings. The masses believed in their own power and role to transform and supervise the cadres and all agreed to organize a guarantee committee. Eleven mass representatives were elected on the spot to establish a guarantee committee, and they were publicly elected as the presidium of the cadre-mass unity conference.
　　Let go of democracy and guide wrong attitudes to correct attitudes
　　The masses were relieved of their worries, and their enthusiasm for speaking as masters was aroused. The opinions that had been suppressed in their hearts for many years were brought up one by one. "The masses have not turned over, and cadre ×× lives in a building." "Cadre ×× sleeps with a landlord's spy woman and personally leads the mule that the farmers' association gave him to send the landlord's woman back to her mother's house." "×× protects landlords and wealthy people." "During the famine years, Director ×× received relief funds but did not distribute them, and more than a dozen people starved to death." "Cadre ×× casually puts spy hats on the masses." "The cadres do not mobilize their wives to attend meetings."… There were many opinions. Some even cried when they mentioned it. When it was mentioned that Director ×× punished the masses in 1942 and randomly labeled them, and now he enjoys high houses and big horses, the brewing meeting in the second street could not continue, and the emotions of the masses changed from grief to indignation.
　　The leadership immediately raised questions for discussion, "Is Director ×× a landlord and wealthy person or a liberated mass?" "Is he working for Chiang Kai-shek or for the masses?" "Although there are mistakes, are there still many merits?" "These mistakes are all mistakes in serving the masses, and the work is not done well enough. What should be done?" The masses in each street organized discussions in groups based on neighborhood units. After discussions, all the masses unanimously recognized that the cadres of the new society are serving the masses, and they have contributed and achieved results in various tasks and movements, and that untangling knots is a matter for the peasant family, and the attitude of fighting against landlords should not be adopted. Instead, opinions and criticisms should be made, and problems should be corrected. "What should be done if cadres resolutely refuse to admit their mistakes?" A few cadres had more shortcomings and were more stubborn, and the masses did not believe that they could reflect. Later, after small and large group discussions, everyone set a mass discipline that no cadre should be treated like a landlord in struggle. The return of fruits should also be conscious and voluntary. Those who did not reflect thoroughly or were unwilling to reflect at the general meeting would be entrusted to the guarantee committee and the village cadres who had reflected thoroughly to help them get through their thoughts. If they still did not realize their shortcomings, they would be sent to the district for rectification, and they would return to the masses to make a self-examination when they recognized their shortcomings.
　　At this point, the masses were not only able to raise all their opinions about the cadres, but also, after several repeated educations and enlightenments, they also realized the position and attitude they should take towards their cadres. They understood the position and principles that a family should abide by.
　　A family unites
　　The conference officially opens
　　At the meeting, the chairman first announced that this was a mass family unity conference, a family meeting, and landlords were not eligible to participate. The masses cleared the venue, and the meeting began according to the general procedure. After the meeting, the guarantee committee officially announced at the meeting that their tasks were: 1. To guarantee that the cadres would not retaliate. 2. To supervise the cadres to correct their shortcomings and fulfill their self-reflection. 3. To guarantee that the masses would not take a dynamic attitude. Then, the cadre representatives explained to the masses their understanding of washing their faces and their determination to accept the opinions of the masses.
　　The cadres' self-reflection and examination were carried out one by one. When the presidium announced that a certain cadre was making an examination, the masses first raised their opinions, then the person answered and reflected on them. Misunderstandings in the opinions raised by the masses could be clarified, and shortcomings and mistakes not raised by the masses could also be supplemented by themselves. Once a self-reflection and reply were completed, opinions could be raised again and self-reflection could be made again until both the cadres and the masses had no objections.
　　A total of seventeen main cadres in the village conducted self-reflection and examination at the conference, including the director of the farmers' association, the political director, the village chief, the public security officer, the warehouse director, the militia captain, and the cooperative manager. The cadres of each street (Yetao is divided into four streets), the street head, the women's director, and the civil affairs committee member conducted self-reflection and examination separately in each street.
　　Because the cadres were ideologically prepared for this cadre-mass untangling of knots in advance and had a correct understanding, they were able to take the initiative in various links, so they were able to deeply examine their shortcomings in front of the masses. For example, in addition to accepting the opinions raised by the masses, cadre ×× also supplemented the fact that he had stolen several pieces of clothing, more than a zhang of cloth, and a sweater from passers-by during the Pinghan Campaign, and mobilized his mother and woman to wash their faces, and self-reported the baggage of preserving the landlord. He also examined the three major shortcomings in the roots of his thinking: First, the view of acting according to the situation, so the struggle against the landlord was not resolute and thorough. Second, the practice of monopolizing and substituting, looking down on the masses, and not accepting the opinions of the masses. Third, the selfish and self-interested thinking, so he became corrupt and took other people's things. Cadre ×× examined the process of his embezzling fruits, saying, "I was in charge of keeping the fruits. At first, I just took a piece of cloth casually, thinking of making a new cloth shirt for my wife for the New Year, but there was no bottom half, so I tried to get a new pair of pants. After having clothes and pants, I wanted hats, shoes, and socks. After having clothes for my wife, I wanted clothes for myself and my children. After having clothes to wear, I wanted things to use, so as a custodian, I embezzled more than sixty fruits."
　　Every cadre thoroughly examined himself after the masses enthusiastically raised their opinions, and reflected on many shortcomings that the masses had not mentioned, which moved the masses of the whole village, won enthusiastic praise from the venue, and moved and promoted the self-reflection of other cadres. Every day when the conference adjourned, there was only discussion in the streets and alleys. Some said, "Look how thoroughly people reflect, speaking with reason and emotion." Some said, "The opinions in my heart are resolved when I speak them." Some said, "It's really not easy to be a cadre. If your attitude is not good, the masses will also raise opinions." "If the cadre's wife doesn't attend the meeting, it also becomes the cadre's black spot." "Embezzling even a needle and a thread cannot escape everyone's eyes." Some said, "Yetao is going to be good this time. The customs are going to change greatly. If cadres are a little corrupt, they will be examined, and the masses will not dare to be easily corrupted." "If cadres do not protect landlords, the masses will not dare to protect landlords easily." In an atmosphere of righteousness, some individual inaccuracies and private grievances were immediately discovered by other masses. The theme of the masses' discussion was the cadres' attitude of self-reflection. The most thorough self-examination was the most praised by the masses, and the prestige was also improved. Therefore, washing the face became an honor, and self-reflection formed a craze. Two cadres who had many shortcomings and were stubborn did not examine themselves thoroughly in front of the masses for the first time. Many masses estimated that they would only be dismissed in the end and go to the district for rectification, but after the collective help of the village cadres and the influence of mass public opinion and the promotion of the self-reflection craze, they were very thorough when they examined themselves at the mass meeting for the second time, and the masses were unexpectedly satisfied.
　　The self-reflection lasted for four days. Under the promotion of the cadres' self-reflection, the mass activists also requested self-reflection. Because time did not allow, only a few people were carried out, and it was planned to carry them out separately on a small scale in the future during production gaps.
　　Masses commend merits
　　Evaluate merits and support cadres
　　After the examination meeting was over, it turned to commending and evaluating the cadres' merits. While the masses criticized the cadres' shortcomings, they did not obliterate the cadres' merits and achievements. The eyes of the masses are very bright. Unexpectedly, the masses know the cadres' merits, big and small. They are clearly stated by different masses. For example, for the past eight or nine years, many cadres have worked for the masses day and night, leading the opposition to the old regime, opposing grain and money levies, opposing black land, opposing maintenance, reducing rent and interest, land reform, fighting locusts and saving disasters, and the vigorous revolutionary struggle of large-scale production, leading the masses to turn themselves over, especially since the land leveling and patching-up movement last year, they have been so busy that their eyes are red and they cannot take care of their own production. And the merits and advantages of each cadre were summarized.
　　The standard of model workers has been further recognized by the masses, and the excellent qualities of the cadres have been deeply imprinted in the minds of the masses. At the end of the meeting, the masses rated the merits of all the cadres in the village into five grades. The work of cadres transforming their work style and uniting the cadres and the masses has been carried out continuously for more than a month. The cadres and the masses do not know how many large and small meetings have been held. After the examination and commendation were completed, the masses and the cadres were very happy and willing to have a lively day. They held another cadre-mass unity celebration meeting to support the cadres and love the people. It also happened that soldier Huang Baolai from the village had made great contributions on the front line, and the front line sent good news. The two happy events were combined, and the people of Yetao were particularly excited. At the meeting on this day, the cadre representatives thanked the masses for their help, and the activists stated their determination to unite closely with the cadres and the masses in the future and play a bridging role. The mass representative was an elderly person. He compared the old regime's headman in the village to explain the reason why the cadres of the new society are their own people. He said that the old headman oppressed the masses and extorted the people, lying on the kang all day and smoking opium, not doing anything for the people, and the masses had to give him gifts during the New Year and festivals; the cadres of the new society eat their own food and wear their own clothes, set an example in assigning errands and money, and are busy for the masses day and night. If they get an extra piece of clothing or a piece of cloth, they must return it to the masses. If their speaking attitude is not good, they must also accept the criticism of the masses. In the old society, if the headman beat or scolded them, the people could only say good things. In the new society, the masses must also rise up to be masters and elect cadres. This is really the cadre of the people and should be supported, respond to the various calls of the cadres, accept the leadership of the cadres, and the family should work together to do a good job in the village.
　　Entertainment began, singing, telling fast board stories, performing stories, shouting slogans... On and off the stage, the cadres and the masses made a scene, showing the new spirit of democracy and liveliness after the unity of the cadres and the masses.

　　正确解决干群关系的模范
    武安冶陶群众评功拥干
    李冰洁
    冶陶镇过去是游击区，有八○八户人家，二千七百八十几口人。填平补齐运动在冶陶已进行了三、四个月，但仍有十分之六的群众（妇女在内）不参加会议，绝大多数老实农民在会上也不发言，其中虽有些是比较真正落后一些，但许多人是对本村封建消灭的不彻底有意见，对干部积极分子都翻了身，而自己没有翻身或翻身不彻底，感到很大委屈和牢骚。不发言的原因是怕提了意见不顶事，或者反而碰钉子；而有些干部则认为群众中有不少自私自利分子，要做到没有意见不可能。如果事事都要征求群众意见，实在麻烦。有些干部认为自己对群众有功，翻身就该比群众高一点，群众不如干部能力强，只有听干部的意见。因此，领导上认为要将冶陶工作向前推进一步，关键就在于发动全体“落后”老实农民，改造干部作风，改善干群关系，否则进一步发动群众推动全部工作是不可能的。
    必须首先表功劳谈模范事迹，发扬正气提高干部积极性。
    过旧年不久，即进行干部洗脸、干群解圪塔的工作，但方法不对，没有成绩。领导上看到先反省不行，容易打击干部情绪。经过几次研究讨论，就及时的改变了方法，变为首先在干部中进行表功劳、比模范、叙委屈、谈经验，在肯定干部功劳的基础上，使干部敢于正视自己的缺点。
    表功劳的会议开始，当政治主任说到：“敌人在时，我每天给八路军送饭、送消息，被敌人发现了，敌人几次威胁，我简直不敢回家，老婆又怕又埋怨，我还是不顾一切的坚持工作。”精神很兴奋，大家很感动。谈到农会主任的优点，大家都说他的斗争性强，当斗争他本家一个地主的时候，群众不敢上前，他打先锋才带领起了群众。群众都说他是“揭石板盖的人”。大家还表扬了商联会主任为着减轻小商贩的负担，不怕打击、不受利诱，经过种种困难，清出了大商店逃避负担的事实。又说：“民兵队长不摆架子，不闹威风，出发时，连队员吃饭睡觉都很关心，作战时，自己打先锋，全体民兵都能紧张的团结在他的周围。”民兵桂喜出发，他的母亲笑着说：“只要有队长一路，我就放心了。”副村长说：“蝗灾最厉害的几天，我每天都是不明就起来打锣，领着老百姓想办法打蝗。”话还没有说完，有人就抢着补充说：“老百姓提起副村长打蝗救灾的大功，至今都很感激。”村长是一个大公无私，任劳任怨的模范工作者，他对群众好，对军队有认识；特别佩服他的一件事，是去年他挨了公家脚夫的打，群众要给他报复，他母亲也埋怨，但他还是首先检讨了自己的缺点，感动的大家不提报复，和平无事了。几天的表功会进行的活泼生动，情绪高涨，许多活生生的模范事迹，影响鼓舞了所有在会的同志。
    干部们的功劳和优点，经过自己说明，互相补充，一些模范干部和模范事迹的榜样确立了，大家都认识到好干部应有明确立场，斗争坚决，虚心负责任，关心与团结群众，吃苦耐劳，不自私自利等等。
    谈功劳鼓励了反省的勇气
    当自己的功劳被自己再认识，并被领导上和所有同志了解了之后；当自己认识了模范党员应具备的条件之后，就自觉的产生了检讨缺点的勇气和愿望，就自然而然的会用这些模范党员的模范事迹来对照自己，检讨自己，就会深刻的体验到洗脸是为了使自己尽善尽美，功上加功，于是愉快的转入了批评与自我批评。
    一个素常被人认为没有什么大缺点的模范干部，他检讨了自己缺乏斗争性，怕惹人“好人”作风，是阶级立场不明确，是可上可下的中农思想作怪。因为怕惹人，好了也不能贯彻，恰常因此得罪群众。参加革命十多年的一个同志检讨脱离群众的原因，是包袱太重，认为自己是冶陶村第一个革命功臣，因此分果实时，就想把最好的都分给自己，忘去了受革命教育最多最长的人，应当多为群众办事。支部书记反省没有大量发展党员和培养积极分子的原因，是怕党员多了难领导，积极分子多了显不出自己的功劳。检讨会开得热烈生动，自己反省，同志们互相批评，并负责反映群众对各个同志的意见。从来不发言的人争着提意见了，一向感到开会是负担的同志提前到了会，同志间的关系空前融洽，一致赞扬说：“几天会议对同志们的教育作用真大，比进了几回训练班还强。”
    在这种向上的革命朝气鼓励下，最现实而又最困难的一环——退出多得果实也进行得很顺利。凡是多得的、贱买的、过去借用地主的、保存农会而被人忘去的，都一一自报出来，愿意退给群众，甚至有些同志个人有宽裕的房子土地，也自愿捐献给农会，让穷兄弟翻身。大家都感觉卸去了包袱，精神非常愉快。
    内部思想弄通了，再开村政委员会，各个非党村政干部用了同样的方法，并受了同志反省的感召，各种思想顾虑很快就解决了，最后除去一、二个缺点比较多和一个与特务地主女人交往的反省不够外，一致要求早些在群众面前进行自我批评，以便早日达到干群团结。
    以上是干部表功检讨思想的准备过程，就是一方面做到使干部情绪高涨兴奋愉快，另方面还要做到反省和退果实彻底。
    干部初步检讨，发动了老实农民割封建尾巴
    在群众方面，开始最普遍的现象是老实农民有意见不敢说，不相信自己有改造干部的力量，所以在村干部进行表功劳反省缺点的同时，则进行进一步发动群众的工作，群众不全体起来，改造干部作风是不可能的。首先曾召集老实农民会议，让他们从自己没有翻透身的各种委屈中检讨全村填平补齐工作，让他们用自己过去穷困与痛苦的生活和地主老财生活对比，并诉苦追根，激动他们的阶级感情，进而启发他们对运动的积极性。三、四天光景，七、八十个所谓“落后分子”，就变成积极分子了，通过他们又串连了两百多个老实农民。这时村干部已经有了反省的勇气与准备，解除了各种顾虑，即自动召集全村新老积极分子会议，说明过去工作有缺点，封建尾巴割得不彻底，基本群众翻身不够，愿意接受批评，放手让群众起来，希望积极分子带领全村群众对冶陶工作作一次总检查，再作一次总发动。当群众已知道干部转变了态度，对他们放了手之后，很快即掀起了挖防空洞割封建尾巴的运动。这次运动在冶陶村是一个最深入最彻底的大革命，全村男女老少都卷入了浪潮。大街小巷分数十处都在斗争，所挖出的内货比过去几次运动加起来的还多。
    经过了割尾巴运动，群众觉悟与情绪更加提高，要求和干部解圪塔。酝酿解圪塔的工作，在各街各闾进行着，领导上放手发扬民主，动员群众大胆提意见。群众中虽有些人敢无顾虑的提意见，但有些群众是提了意见却还不放心、不大胆，有些群众却根本不提，他们的主要思想顾虑，是怕干部报复。还有老实农民怕干部接受不了意见，反而不干工作了。因此他们提出要求上级写保证书，保证干部不报复。上述许多顾虑障碍着运动的热烈开展，群众发言不够普遍（不到二分之一）。但另一方面有少数积极分子态度是不正确的，对干部存着报复与“取而代之”的心理，因此领导上特别注意要正确解决干群关系，决不能放手给少数脱离群众而又与干部对立的分子，而应放手发动老实农民，培养新积极分子，然后由群众在新老积极分子中找出思想正确，有能力的人组成领导集团来领导这一运动。
    于是召集积极分子会议，领导上表明一定与群众撑腰作主，并介绍村干部已有改正错误的决心，同时更强调的提出：应依靠群众自己的力量作保证。群众思想上弄通了，又讨论出办法，提出由群众中推选代表，组织保证委员会，保证干部不报复，监督干部改正错误，退出多得果实。
    会后，积极分子即去串连解释，并开小会酝酿，大会动员，群众相信了自己改造干部监督干部的力量与作用，都赞成组织保证委员会，当场选出十一个群众代表，成立了保证委员会，并公推他们为干群团结大会的主席团。
    放手发扬民主，引导错误态度到正确态度
    群众解除了顾虑，当家说话的热情发动起来了，积压在心中多年的意见都一件件提出来。“群众没有翻身，××干部住了楼房”，“××干部和地主特务的女人睡觉，还亲自牵着农会分给他的骡子去送地主女人回娘家”，“××包庇地主老财”，“灾荒年××主任领了救济款不发放，饿死十几个人”，“××干部随便给群众带特务帽子”，“干部不动员自己的老婆参加会议”，……………意见多得很。有的甚至提起来就哭了，当提到四二年××主任惩罚群众，给群众乱扣帽子，而今竟享用高房大马时，二街的酝酿会开不下去了，群情由悲痛到愤激。（⑵⑶）
    领导上即提出问题讨论，“××主任是地主老财还是翻身群众？”“是给蒋介石办事的还是为群众办事的？”“虽说有错误是否还有很多功劳？”“这些错误都是在为群众办事中的错误，事办得不够好，应该怎么办？”以上问题各街群众以闾为单位分组展开讨论，经过讨论之后，全体群众一致认识到新社会的干部是给群众办事的，在各种工作中各段运动中都有功劳有成绩，解圪塔是农民一家人的事情，不能像对地主一样动态度起斗争，是应提意见批评，有毛病应使他改正。“如果遇到坚决不承认错误的干部如何办？”有两三个干部缺点较多，个性又较固执，群众不相信他们能反省。后经过小会大会讨论，大家定出一条群众纪律，对任何干部都不能像对地主一样的斗争，退果实也应是自觉自愿，在大会反省不彻底的或不愿反省的即委托保证委员会和反省彻底的村干部共同帮助打通其思想，再不觉悟，即送区上整风，何时认识了自己缺点再回来在群众面前检讨。
    至此，群众对干部的意见不仅能都提出来，而且经过几次反复的教育启发，也都认识了对自己的干部应取的立场和态度。
    群众方面的准备工作进行到这里就算完成了，就是一方面做到知无不言言无不尽，另一方面对干部能不动态度，懂得了一家人应遵守立场原则。
    一家人团结
    大会正式开幕
    会上主席首先宣布这是农民的一家人团结大会，是家庭会议，地主没有资格参加。群众清查了会场，会议即照一般程序开始。开会后，保证委员会正式在大会上宣布他们的任务是：一、保证干部不报复。二、监督干部改正缺点，反省兑现。三、保证群众不动态度。接着干部代表向群众说明他们对洗脸的认识，和接受群众意见的决心。
    干部反省检讨系一个一个进行，当主席团宣布某某干部检讨的时候，先由群众提意见，然后本人答复并反省，群众提的意见中，有误会的可以申明，群众没有提出的缺点错误，自己也可以补充。一次反省答复完毕，有意见再提，再反省，直至干群双方都没有意见为止。
    全村主要干部在大会上进行反省检讨的共十七人，有农会主任、政治主任、村长、公安员、仓库主任、自卫队长、合作社经理，其次各街（冶陶分四街）的干部、街闾长、妇女主任、民事委员则在各街分头进行反省检讨。
    干部们因对这次干群解圪塔事前有了思想准备，有了正确认识，各种环节都能争取主动，所以在群众面前都能深刻的检讨自己的缺点，如××干部除了接受群众提的意见外，还补充了在平汉战役中偷窃过路客人几件衣服、一丈多市布、一件毛衣，并且动员他的母亲和女人洗脸，自报保存地主的包袱。还检讨到自己思想根源上的三大缺点：一是看势行事的看法，因此斗争地主不坚决，不彻底。二是包办代替的作法，看不起群众，不接受群众意见。三是自私自利的想法，所以才腐化，才拿别人的东西。××干部反省他与群众争买楼房的时候说：“自己连面都不出，只是预先托人去向卖家表示自己有买的意思，自己是干部，卖家还敢不卖给干部，于是很轻便的楼房就到自己手了。”××干部检讨他贪污果实的经过是这样的：“我保管果实，最初只顺便拿了一块布，心想过年给老婆做件新布衫，但有了上身没有下身也不中，又设法弄了一条新裤，有了衣裤又想帽子鞋袜，有了老婆的又想自己的和孩子的，有了穿的又想用的，所以当了一次保管委员，贪污果实达六十几件之多。”
    每一个干部经过群众热烈的提过意见后，检讨自己都很彻底，并反省出许多群众没有提到的缺点，感动了全村群众，博得了会场热烈赞扬，并又感动与推动了其他干部的反省。每天大会休会的时候，只听街头巷尾议论纷纷，有的说：“看人家反省的多彻底，说的入情入理。”有的说：“心中的意见说了就解开了”。有的说：“当干部真不容易，态度不好，群众也要提意见。”“干部老婆不参加会，也成了干部的黑”。“贪污一针一线都躲不过大家的眼光”。有的说：“冶陶这次可闹好了，风俗要大变了，干部腐化一点点都检讨出来，群众也就不敢轻易腐化了”。“干部不包庇地主，群众也不敢轻易包庇地主了”。在正气昂扬的空气里，有个别不确的事实和报私怨的，当即被别的群众发现出来。群众议论的主题是干部们的反省态度，检讨最深刻的就最受群众赞扬，威信也越提高。因此洗脸成了光荣，检讨形成了热潮。两个缺点多而又固执的干部，第一次在群众面前反省不彻底，许多群众都估计他们最后只有撤职，到区上整风，但经过村干部集体帮助与群众舆论的影响及反省热潮的推动，第二次在群众大会上反省时，却很彻底，群众都觉得出乎意外的满意。
    反省进行了四天，在干部反省的推动下，群众积极分子也要求反省，因时间不允许，只进行几个人，拟待将来在生产空隙中小规模的分别进行。
    群众表功
    评功拥干
    检讨会完，即转入与干部表功评功。群众批评了干部的缺点，也不抹煞干部的功劳和成绩。群众的眼睛亮得很，想不到干部的大小功劳群众都知道，经过不同群众口中都清清楚楚说出来了，如对八、九年来，许多干部白天黑夜的为群众工作，领导反旧政权，反派粮派款、反黑地、反维持、减租减息、土地改革、打蝗救灾、大生产等轰轰烈烈的革命斗争，领导着群众翻身，尤其去年进行填平补齐运动以来，忙得连眼都熬红了，也顾不上自己生产。并把每个干部的功劳和优点都做了总结。
    模范工作者的标准又进一步为群众所认识，干部们的优良品质深深的刻印在群众的脑海中。会末，群众将全村干部的功劳评为五等。干部改造作风干群团结的工作连续的进行一个多月的时间，干部和群众不知开了多少大会小会，到检讨和表功完毕，群众和干部都很高兴，愿意热热闹闹玩一天，又开了一个拥干爱民的干群团结庆祝大会。又巧逢本村战士黄宝来在前线立了大功，前线送来了喜报，两件喜事合在一起，冶陶人们格外兴奋，这一天会上干部代表感谢群众帮助，积极分子表明他们今后决心紧紧的和干部群众团结在一起，发挥桥梁作用。群众代表是一个上了年岁的人，他以本村旧政权保长来对比，说明新社会干部是自己人的道理，他说旧保长欺压群众敲诈人民，成天躺在炕上吸毒品，不为人民办事，过年过节还要群众给他送礼；新社会的干部吃自己、穿自己，派差派款起模范，白天黑夜为群众忙，多得一件衣服、一块布，也要退还给群众，说话态度不好，也要接受群众批评。旧社会被保长打了骂了，老百姓只能说好话。新社会群众还要起来当主人，评选干部，这真是老百姓的干部，应该拥护，响应干部的各种号召，接受干部的领导，一家人，一条心作好本村工作。
    娱乐开始，唱歌、说快板、演故事、喊口号…………台上台下，干部和群众闹成一片，显示了干群团结后民主活泼的新精神。
