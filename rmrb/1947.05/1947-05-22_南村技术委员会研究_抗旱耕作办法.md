　　Southern Village Technical Committee Studies
    Drought-Resistant Farming Methods
    [This newspaper's report from Licheng] The Southern Village Agricultural Technology Research Committee of Licheng, under the promotion and leadership of labor hero Yuan Laohu, convened the technical committee on the night of May 7th and researched the following drought-resistant farming methods: 1. Plowing – This year, the spring drought has made harrowing difficult, so shallow and fine plowing is advisable. For example, if a crop needs to be sown three finger-widths deep, plow only two and a half finger-widths deep. This way, the fertilizer can be turned into the soil, and the seeds will be sown precisely on moist soil, making it easier for seedlings to emerge. 2. Harrow once more after plowing to compact the loose soil, making the soil even and nurturing the field. 3. Seed soaking – For millet and corn, three types of seed soaking methods are suitable. First, soak in cold water to float and remove any empty seeds. Second, use very hot water (a ratio of ten bowls of boiling water to five bowls of cold water) to soak the cold-water-soaked seeds again for disinfection. Finally, it is even better to soak in ash water. 4. When it is dry and there is no field moisture for sowing, adopt the method of cross-plowing and lengthwise sowing (plowing east-west and sowing north-south). Because no matter how finely you plow, there will always be areas that are not plowed properly. If you use the method of cross-plowing and lengthwise sowing, the seeds will easily be sown on moist soil, making it easier for seedlings to emerge. 5. When it is dry and there is only a little rain, it is necessary to seize the opportunity to sow in the field. Be sure to sow below the moist soil and above the dry soil. This way, when the sun evaporates and shines, the moisture can seep down to the seeds, making it easier for the seeds to germinate and emerge. (Ke Ren, Ci Meng)

　　南村技术委员会研究
    抗旱耕作办法
    【本报黎城讯】黎城南村农业技术研究委员会在劳动英雄原老虎的推动领导下，于五月七日夜召集技术委员会，研究出如下的抗旱耕作办法：一、耕地——今年春旱垧不好，宜浅耕细耕，例如一种作物下种需三指深，耕时只耕二指半，这样肥料能翻在地里，种籽恰恰种在湿土上，客易捉苗。二、耕后再耙一次，能使松土蹋实，一则土匀、二则养垧。三、浸种——谷和玉茭，宜用三种浸种法，第一次先用冷水浸，能把秕籽漂起捞去，第二次用大热水（十碗滚水配五碗冷水作比例），把冷水浸过的种籽再浸一次，这样可以消毒，最后再用灰水浸一次更好。四、在天旱没垧下种时，要采取横耕顺种的办法（东西耕南北种），因为无论怎样耕的细，中间总有耕不着的地方，若用横耕顺种办法，种籽易种到湿土上，容易捉苗。五、在天旱有时下了点小雨，需要抢垧下种，一定要种在垧土下面，干土上面，这样太阳一蒸晒，水份可以下浸到种籽上，种籽容易发芽出土。（克仁、次孟）
