　　Jiluyu Rear Headquarters Commends Hebei West and Other Counties' Stretcher Teams

　　[This newspaper, Jiluyu, 12th dispatch] The Rear Headquarters of the Jiluyu Military Region recently issued a circular commending the expedition stretcher teams from Hebei West and other counties that participated in the Second Pinghan Campaign. The Hebei West County stretcher team traveled thousands of miles for more than twenty days, with no one deserting. The Nangle and other county stretcher teams were also very solid. The Guancheng stretcher team paid attention to strict organizational work and ideological leadership. For example, when crossing to the west side of the railway, they focused on ideological reflection. County Chief Shen led the stretcher team deep into the masses, leading by example. The Yanggu stretcher team rushed to the front line, maintaining order and organization under artillery fire, with cadres personally carrying stretchers. The Zhuangping stretcher team maintained good marching order, with no one falling behind. The stretcher team of District Chief Wang of the Sixth District completed its mission three times on the front line after a long-distance march. When the Boping stretcher team transported the wounded from Yangwu to ××, they made an agreement not to shake, sway, or make noise, and the civilians voluntarily paid for food for the wounded. The Pu County stretcher team automatically converted to a standing stretcher team and performed well on the front lines. Comrade Feng Xiwen, a cultural and educational assistant in the Second District, went to the front line three times and rescued five wounded soldiers.
　　[This newspaper dispatch] In the battle to annihilate the 49th Brigade, the militia stretcher teams also had their own gains. Cheng Zifa, the militia captain of the First District of Lin County, led more than ten militiamen and automatically launched an attack, fired two shots, and captured a rifle and a prisoner. The stretcher brigade of the Seventh District of Lin County, in the enemy's chaotic retreat, searched out a prisoner and four rifle grenades at Tongshan in Jun County.
　　Li Heishui, the stretcher squad leader of the Fourth District of Huguan, and several stretcher bearers captured two prisoners in a pit, seizing one rifle and one Mauser pistol. (Xiaohu)
