    The Increasingly Consolidated and Developing Friendship Between the Chinese and Korean Peoples
    ——Commemorating the First Anniversary of the Signing of the Sino-Korean Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement
    Liu Ran
    In November 1953, a government delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, headed by Premier Kim Il-sung, visited China. Our government and the Korean government delegation held negotiations, and on November 23, 1953 signed the Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement between the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People’'s Republic of Korea. Today marks the first anniversary of the signing of this significant agreement, which embodies the fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples.
    In the past year, the unbreakable friendship between our people and the Korean people, forged in blood in the struggle against American imperialist aggression and in defense of peace in the Far East and the world, has been further developed and consolidated.
    In the joint communiqué issued by the Chinese and Korean governments a year ago, both sides expressed their determination to thoroughly implement the Korean Armistice Agreement and peacefully resolve the Korean issue. The communiqué pointed out: The proposal of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the peaceful unification of Korea is the sincere desire of the Korean people. The Chinese people have always sympathized with this sincere desire of the Korean people. The two governments are willing to cooperate with all relevant countries to realize the great cause of the peaceful unification of Korea. Based on this shared aspiration, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have consistently upheld the Armistice Agreement, severely打击ed the conspiracies of the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique to undermine the Korean Armistice Agreement and the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. During the discussions on the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference, our delegation and the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, together with the Soviet delegation, made their utmost efforts and put forward a series of fair and reasonable proposals, hoping to reach an agreement on the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. Although the Geneva Conference failed to reach an agreement on the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue due to the obstruction and sabotage of the US government and the Syngman Rhee clique, China, the Soviet Union, and Korea still believe that the Korean issue has not been removed from the agenda. In the government work report delivered by Premier Zhou Enlai at the First Session of the First National People's Congress of our country, and in the joint declaration issued by the Chinese and Soviet governments on October 12, suggestions were made for continuing to seek a peaceful solution to the Korean issue, advocating that a conference to discuss the Korean issue be convened in the near future, with broad participation of relevant countries. This proposal has been supported by the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and by peace-loving countries and people around the world.
    Recently, the Korean people have made new efforts for the peaceful unification of their motherland. The Eighth Session of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea called for broad consultations and mutual contacts between the people of North and South Korea to discuss the issue of seeking the peaceful unification of the motherland. The Chinese people fully support this legitimate aspiration of the Korean people and firmly believe that the people of North and South Korea will overcome the obstruction of the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique, gradually carry out mutual consultations and contacts, so as to strive for the peaceful unification of the motherland.
    In order to heal the wounds of war, restore and develop the people's economy, and create conditions for the peaceful reunification of the motherland, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has carried out large-scale economic and cultural restoration and construction work in the past year, and is effectively implementing the Three-Year Plan for construction. The Chinese people actively support the peaceful labor of the Korean people as much as they care about their own national construction. Our government has gratuitously allocated 800,000 million yuan in aid funds to the Korean government in accordance with the joint communiqué of the Chinese and Korean governments; by the end of October this year, materials worth 289,210 million yuan had been allocated, completing 96.4 percent of this year's delivery plan, including locomotives, freight cars, passenger cars, coal and coking coal, pumps, motors, cement, timber, steel, and a large number of daily necessities and stationery. In addition, 278 technicians and technical workers were sent to Korea to help with the restoration and construction work. The assistance given to the Korean people by the Chinese people, the great Soviet Union, and the people of various people's democratic countries, as Marshal Kim Il-sung said:
  “Has provided us with favorable conditions to effectively complete the restoration and construction of our people's economy, which has been severely damaged by the war, in a very short period of time.”
    The outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people in Korea—the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers—have also devoted themselves to the restoration and construction cause of the Korean people with selfless labor. According to incomplete statistics: In the first six months of this year, the various units of the Volunteers helped the Korean people build a total of 661 dikes such as Aishan River and Longchuan River, with a total length of more than 171,400 meters; more than 540 canals, with a total length of more than 181,800 meters; repaired 6 river channels, with a total length of more than 10,600 meters; and repaired 4 large reservoirs. These projects involved a total of more than 2,088,300 cubic meters of earth and stone excavation and filling. During the same period, the Chinese People's Volunteers also helped the Korean people build 463 bridges for highways and railways, 11 enterprise buildings such as brick and tile factories, 13,063 houses, 172 cinemas, hospitals, auditoriums, government office buildings, etc., and also helped Korean farmers carry out reclamation, cultivation, rice transplanting, weeding, harvesting and other labor on a total of more than 17,836,000 ping of land, and planted more than 8,866,700 trees.
    In the past year, the economic and cultural exchanges between our country and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have also seen significant development.
    In terms of economic ties, the railway departments of the two countries signed the Sino-Korean Border Railway Joint Transportation Agreement. According to this agreement, joint transportation of goods, passengers and luggage has been established between the two countries. Postal, telegraph, and wired telephone communications between the two countries were opened to each other as early as 1950. This year, in order to further strengthen ties and adapt to the needs of economic cooperation and international trade between the two countries, the postal and telecommunications departments of the two countries signed an agreement on the exchange of postal parcels. Other agreements, such as the agreement on the exchange rate between RMB and Korean Won, the protocol on border currency exchange and the protocol on non-trade currency exchange, and the protocol on the exchange of goods in 1954, have strengthened economic and trade ties between the two countries and promoted the development of mutual assistance and friendly relations.
    In terms of cultural exchanges, the Korean people have sent more than 200 students to study in our country's universities or secondary technical schools, and our country's students have also begun to be sent to Korea this year. Other aspects such as film screenings and book exchanges have also seen frequent interactions this year.
    It should be particularly pointed out that the government delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, headed by Marshal Kim Il-sung, the beloved leader of the Korean people, was invited to participate in our country's 5th National Day celebration, which made the Chinese people feel greatly honored. Prior to this, the Democratic Front for the Unification of the Fatherland of Korea sent a delegation of the Korean people to visit China in March this year, headed by Kim Ung-gi, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea, as well as an art troupe including more than 360 Korean literary and art workers. They visited 28 cities in North China, Northwest China, Southwest China, East China, Central South China, and Northeast China, as well as ethnic minority areas, for more than three months, and performed 129 art performances, which were warmly welcomed by the Chinese people everywhere.
    The Chinese people regard the victory of the Korean people against American imperialist aggression and the selfless labor in the post-war reconstruction work as direct support for the Chinese people's socialist construction cause.
    The mutual assistance and friendly relations between China and Korea will surely continue to be consolidated and developed on the basis of the deep foundation of the past. The Chinese people firmly believe that the Korean people will eventually overcome the obstruction and sabotage of the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique, realize the peaceful reunification of their motherland, and make greater contributions to maintaining peace in the Far East and the world.

    中朝两国人民日益巩固和发展的友谊
    ——纪念中朝经济及文化合作协定签订一周年
    刘然
    一九五三年十一月，以金日成首相为首的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府代表团访问了中国。我国政府和朝鲜政府代表团进行了谈判，在一九五三年十一月二十三日签订了中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国经济及文化合作协定。今天，这一表现中朝两国人民兄弟般友谊的重大协定的签订，已经一周年了。
    在这一年中间，我国人民和朝鲜人民在并肩反对美帝国主义的侵略、维护远东和世界和平的斗争中用鲜血凝固起来的牢不可破的友谊，得到了进一步的发展和巩固。
    中朝两国政府在一年前发表的谈判公报中，共同表示了彻底实施朝鲜停战协定和和平解决朝鲜问题的决心。公报中指出：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府关于和平统一朝鲜的主张，是朝鲜人民的衷心愿望。中国人民一贯同情朝鲜人民这一衷心愿望。两国政府愿意为实现和平统一朝鲜的伟大事业而和一切有关国家合作。根据这一共同的意愿，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军始终维护停战协定、严重地打击了美国和李承晚集团力图破坏朝鲜停战协定和中立国监察委员会工作的阴谋。在日内瓦会议关于和平解决朝鲜问题的讨论中，我国代表团和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团，同苏联代表团在一起，曾经尽了最大的努力，提出一系列的公平合理的建议，希望就和平解决朝鲜问题达成协议。虽然由于美国政府和李承晚集团的阻挠和破坏，使日内瓦会议没有达成关于和平解决朝鲜问题的协议，中、苏、朝三国仍然认为，朝鲜问题并没有从议程上抹掉。周恩来总理在我国第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上所作的政府工作报告中，中苏两国政府在十月十二日发表的联合宣言中，都为继续谋求朝鲜问题的和平解决提出了建议，主张在最近的将来召开讨论朝鲜问题的会议，由有关各国广泛参加。这个建议得到了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的支持，得到了全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的支持。
    最近，朝鲜人民又为祖国的和平统一作了新的努力。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议第八届会议号召南北朝鲜人民之间开展广泛的协商和相互接触，以讨论谋求祖国和平统一的问题。中国人民完全支持朝鲜人民的这种正当的愿望，深信南北朝鲜人民将会克服美国和李承晚集团的阻挠，逐步开展相互的协商和接触，以争取祖国的和平统一。
    为了医治战争创伤，恢复和发展人民经济，并为和平统一祖国创造条件，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国在过去的一年中大规模地开展了经济、文化的恢复建设工作，卓有成效地执行着三年建设计划。中国人民像关心自己的国家建设一样，积极支持朝鲜人民的和平劳动。我国政府根据中朝两国政府谈判公报无偿地拨赠给朝鲜政府八万亿元人民币的援助款项；到今年十月底止，已拨付价值二万八千九百二十一亿元的物资，完成了今年度交货计划的百分之九十六点四，其中包括机车、货车、客车、煤和焦煤、抽水机、电动机、水泥、木材、钢材及大量生活必需品和文具等。此外，还派遣了技术人员和技术工人二百七十八人到朝鲜帮助恢复建设工作。中国人民和伟大的苏联以及各人民民主国家人民给予朝鲜人民的援助，正如金日成元帅所说的：
  “使我们具备了能够在很短时期内有成效地完成恢复建设因遭受战争惨重破坏的我国人民经济的有利条件。”
    在朝鲜的中国人民的优秀儿女——中国人民志愿军指战员们，也以忘我的劳动投入了朝鲜人民的恢复建设事业中。根据不完全的统计：志愿军各部队在今年头六个月里，共帮助朝鲜人民修筑了艾山江、龙川江等堤坝六百六十一条，总长十七万一千四百多公尺；水渠五百四十多条，总长十八万一千八百多公尺；修治了河道六条，总长一万零六百多公尺；另外补修了四个大型贮水池。这些工程，共出土石和填土石二百零八万八千三百多立方公尺。同一时期，中国人民志愿军还帮助朝鲜人民修建公路和铁路的桥梁四百六十三座，砖瓦工厂等企业建筑十一座，房屋一万三千零六十三间，电影院、医院、礼堂、政府机关办公室等一百七十二座，还帮助朝鲜农民在总计一千七百八十三万六千多坪的土地里进行了开荒、耕种、插秧、锄草和收割等劳动，并植树八百八十六万六千七百多棵。
    一年以来，我国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的经济文化交流也有了显著的发展。
    在经济联系方面，两国铁道部门签订了中朝国境铁路联运协定。根据这一协定，两国间已经建立了货物联运、旅客、行李联运关系。两国间的邮政、电报、有线电话通讯早在一九五○年即已互相开放，今年，两国邮电部门为了进一步加强联系并适应两国经济合作和国际贸易的需要，又签订了互换邮政包裹协定。其他像两国间签订的关于人民币与朝鲜币比价的协定、关于边境货币兑换议定书和非贸易货币兑换议定书、关于一九五四年货物交换的议定书等等，都加强了两国间经济贸易的联系，促进了互助友好关系的发展。
    在文化交流方面，朝鲜人民已派出了留学生二百余人在我国各高等学校或中等技术学校学习，而我国的留学生也在今年开始派往朝鲜。其他像电影放映、书刊交流等各方面，今年也有着频繁的交往。
    应当特别指出的是：以朝鲜人民敬爱的领袖金日成元帅为首的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府代表团应邀参加了我国建国五周年的国庆，这使中国人民感到莫大的光荣。在此以前朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线在今年三月派出了以朝鲜最高人民会议常任委员会副委员长金应基为首的朝鲜人民访华代表团以及包括朝鲜文艺工作者三百六十余人的艺术团访问我国。他们在我国的华北、西北、西南、华东、中南、东北等地的二十八个城市以及少数民族地区进行了三个多月的访问，并作了一百二十九次艺术演出，到处受到中国人民热烈的欢迎。
    中国人民把朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义侵略的胜利和在战后恢复建设工作中忘我的劳动，都认为是对中国人民进行社会主义建设事业的直接支持。
    中朝两国的互助友好关系，今后必将在过去深厚的基础上继续巩固和发展。中国人民深信，朝鲜人民终将战胜美国和李承晚集团的阻挠破坏，实现祖国的和平统一，并为维护远东和世界和平作出更大的贡献。
