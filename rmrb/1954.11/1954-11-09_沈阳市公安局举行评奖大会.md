    Shenyang Public Security Bureau Holds Awards Ceremony
    The Shenyang Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau held an awards ceremony on October 29th to commend outstanding workers and advanced units within the public security organs.
    Over the past year, 661 model workers and 27 advanced units have emerged in the Shenyang public security organs. The entire traffic police team at the Sanwei Road traffic post, awarded collective merit of a high order, has created the advanced experience of "fast vehicles not stopping, slow vehicles not piling up, pedestrians not waiting" through close unity and joint effort, and has not had a traffic accident from 1953 to the present. Wang Jintai, a household registration officer who was awarded merit of a high order, was able to rely on the masses, actively cooperate with the street security and defense committees and criminal police, and solve two theft cases, recovering over 20 million yuan in wealth for the state. Detective Jin Zaihe was also awarded a major merit for solving a major case. At the awards ceremony, Liu Baotian, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Shenyang Municipal Committee and Mayor of the Shenyang Municipal People's Government, pointed out to all public security personnel that public security organs hold an important position in the cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation. Public security organs must strengthen the leadership of the Party, thoroughly overcome the bourgeois individualistic thinking and arrogant sentiments, closely connect with the masses, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and better serve economic construction.
