Letter Summary:

    Why Blindly Mobilize the Masses to Cut Down Timber
    Wu Pingfeng and Shen Xiangan et al. from the Seventh District of Ninghua County, Fujian Province, wrote: Last year, the Fourth District Timber Company of Shicheng County, Jiangxi Province, mobilized the masses in our district to cut and sell Chinese fir. At that time, they promised the masses: "Cut as much as you can! We will buy as much timber as you have." Initially, the timber company did buy a lot, but later they couldn't buy anymore, but they didn't promptly notify the masses to stop cutting, resulting in a large amount of timber being stockpiled and no one buying it. After long-term erosion by wind and rain, this timber has changed from yellowish-white to black and has begun to deteriorate and become moldy. During the floods this summer, a lot of timber was washed away. It is hoped that the Ganzhou Forest Industry Bureau will promptly investigate and deal with this matter.

    为什么盲目发动群众砍伐木材
    福建省宁化县七区巫平峰、沈贤干等来信：去年，江西省石城县四区木材公司，曾在我区发动群众砍卖杉木，当时他们向群众许下了诺言：“你们出力砍伐吧！你们有多少木材，我们就给收购多少。”起初这个木材公司的确收购得不少，后来不能收购了，却没有及时通知群众停止砍伐，以致大批木材积存下来无人收购。这些木材经过风雨长期的侵蚀，已经由黄白色变成黑色，并开始变质霉烂了。今年夏季发水期间，有不少木材被大水冲走了。希望赣州森林工业局对这件事迅速进行检查和处理。
