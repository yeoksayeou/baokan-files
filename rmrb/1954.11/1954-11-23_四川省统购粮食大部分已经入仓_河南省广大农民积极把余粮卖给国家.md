    Most of the Grain Purchased in Sichuan Province Has Been Stored
    Broad Masses of Farmers in Henan Province Actively Sell Surplus Grain to the State
    Farmers in various parts of Sichuan are enthusiastically selling surplus grain to the state. As of the end of October, the amount of grain stored throughout the province had reached 65 percent of the planned purchase. Luzhou City has already completed its storage task. Farmers in Desheng Township, Luxian County, sold more than one million jin of grain this year, exceeding the state's original planned purchase. On October 30, the entire township mobilized more than 1,000 people, sending more than 400,000 jin of grain to the state granary in a single day. The 66 households in Qixin Village, Tanzi Township, Xuyong County, sifted the grain they sold to the state two or three times before sending it to the state grain warehouse. When sending grain to the warehouse, the villages in Wanxian County, under the slogan of "Sell good grain, hand in good grain," first checked the quality of the grain and made preliminary weighings in the village, ensuring that "bad grain does not leave the village." Many areas in the Luzhou Special District adopted the method of collective grain delivery and collective weighing. After the farmers delivered the grain to the warehouse, one or two cadres were responsible for handing over the grain, and the rest of the people returned home to produce, achieving "no delay in production or grain delivery." When Longyun Township Cooperative Village in Longchang County delivered grain, the village head led the team to deliver the grain, and the central group leader stayed in the village to lead production. All 15 mutual aid teams in the village had people plowing the fields at home, and the women went to the fields to sow small spring crops. The grain depots in the 14th, 17th, and 18th districts of Wanxian County also signed storage contracts with relevant villages, agreeing on the time, location, quantity, and quality of storage, with both parties dividing responsibilities to ensure the safe storage of grain and that the grain quality meets standards.

    The broad masses of farmers in Henan Province are enthusiastically selling surplus grain to the state. From late September to November 10, the province has purchased more than 328.5 million jin of grain. The broad masses of farmers regard selling surplus grain as a concrete action to support the country's socialist industrialization. Xu Bingchen and other five agricultural production cooperatives in Xiangcheng County, which started to be cultivated by the state agricultural machine tractor station this year, jointly wrote to the workers of the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant, the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, and the Aircraft Manufacturing Plant, expressing their intention to sell 177,000 jin of grain, 5,000 jin of cotton, 4,700 jin of sesame, and 375,000 jin of tobacco to the state to support their production and construction work. Farmers in many areas deeply appreciate the benefits of the unified purchase and sale of grain and are very enthusiastic about selling grain. Last winter, when the unified purchase of grain was carried out, 25 households in Xiahou Township, Xingyang County, sold more than 90,000 jin of surplus grain, investing the money from the sale into production and expanding mutual aid and cooperative organizations; this summer and autumn, a total of more than 350 households in the township sold more than 141,000 jin of surplus grain to the state.

    四川省统购粮食大部分已经入仓
    河南省广大农民积极把余粮卖给国家
    四川各地农民踊跃把余粮卖给国家。到十月底止，全省入仓粮食已达统购计划的百分之六十五。泸州市入仓任务已经完成。泸县德胜乡农民今年卖粮一百多万斤，超过了国家原订统购计划。十月三十日，全乡出动了一千多人，一天就送入国家粮库四十多万斤粮食。叙永县滩子乡齐心村六十六户农民，把卖给国家的粮食风筛了两三遍才送交国家粮食仓库。万县各乡村在送粮入仓的时候，在“卖好粮、缴好粮”的口号下，自己在村里先检查粮质，初步过秤，做到了“坏粮不出村”。泸州专区许多地区采用集体送粮集体过秤的办法，农民们把粮食送到仓库以后，由一两个干部负责交粮，其余的人都回家生产，做到了“生产、送粮两不误”。隆昌县龙云乡合作村送粮的时候，村长领队送粮，中心组长留村领导生产。全村十五个互助组都有人在家犁田，妇女们便下地播种小春作物。万县第十四、十七、十八等区的粮库还同有关乡村签订入库合同，商定入仓时间、地点、数量和质量，双方分工负责，保证了粮食安全入库，粮质合乎标准。

    河南省广大农民踊跃卖余粮给国家。从九月下旬到十一月十日，全省已收购粮食三亿二千八百五十多万斤。广大农民把卖余粮作为支持国家社会主义工业化的具体行动。襄城县今年开始由国家农业机器拖拉机站代耕的徐丙辰等五个农业生产合作社，联合写信给第一拖拉机制造厂、第一汽车制造厂和飞机制造厂的工人，表示要卖给国家十七万七千斤粮食，以及五千斤棉花、四千七百斤芝麻、三十七万五千斤烟叶，用来支援他们的生产和建设工作。许多地区的农民深切体会到粮食统购统销的好处，卖粮十分踊跃。去年冬季进行粮食统购工作的时候，荥阳县夏候乡有二十五户出售了九万多斤余粮，把卖粮得到的钱投入生产，扩大了互助合作组织；今年夏秋两季，全乡共有三百五十多户卖给国家十四万一千多斤余粮。（本报河南记者站）
