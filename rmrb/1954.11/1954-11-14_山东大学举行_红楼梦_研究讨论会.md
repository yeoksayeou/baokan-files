Xinhua News Agency:

    Shandong University's Scientific Research Committee held a "Dream of the Red Chamber" research symposium on the 7th. The meeting focused on criticizing the bourgeois viewpoints and methods of Hu Shi, Yu Pingbo, and others in researching classical literature.

    Those who spoke at the meeting included: Hua Gang, President of Shandong University; Vice Presidents Lu Kanru and Tong Dizhou; Dean of Studies Wu Fuheng; Professors Zheng Hesheng, Liang Xiyan, Feng Yuanjun, Gao Lan, Guan Dedong, Xu Wenyu, Huang Jiade, Zhang Weihua, and Wu Dakun; and Lecturer Qi Shugeng. In their speeches, they analyzed and explored the differences between the working class and the bourgeoisie in their attitudes towards literary heritage, and the differences between realism and naturalism. Speakers argued that the bourgeois viewpoints of Hu Shi, Yu Pingbo, etc., were aimed at minimizing the positive significance of classical works such as "Dream of the Red Chamber," guiding the people to escape reality, and weakening the people's fighting power. Our task today should be to conduct scientific research on all valuable classical literature based on Marxist-Leninist literary theory, and to identify the proper position and role of classical works. Everyone unanimously expressed their willingness to actively participate in this revolutionary struggle on the ideological front.

    More than 200 teachers and students from Shandong University attended the symposium. Shandong University is preparing to conduct further research and discussions on "Dream of the Red Chamber."

    山东大学举行“红楼梦”研究讨论会
    山东大学科学研究委员会在七日举行“红楼梦”研究讨论会。会上着重批判了胡适、俞平伯等研究古典文学的资产阶级观点和方法。
    在会上先后发言的有：山东大学校长华岗，副校长陆侃如、童第周，教务长吴富恒，教授郑鹤声、梁希彦、冯沅君、高兰、关德栋、许文雨、黄嘉德、张维华、吴大琨，讲师琦书畊等。在发言中，他们围绕着工人阶级与资产阶级对待文学遗产态度的区别、现实主义与自然主义的区别等方面作了分析和探讨。发言人认为胡适、俞平伯等的资产阶级观点是竭力缩小“红楼梦”等古典作品的积极意义，引导人民逃避现实，削弱人民的斗争力量。我们今天的任务应根据马克思列宁主义的文艺理论，对一切有价值的古典文艺进行科学研究，找出古典作品应有的地位和作用。大家一致表示要积极地参加这一思想战线上的革命斗争。
    出席这次讨论会的有山东大学师生二百多人。山东大学并准备对“红楼梦”作进一步的研究和讨论。（新华社）
