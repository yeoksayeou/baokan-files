    Tens of Thousands of Farmers in Liaoning Province Join Credit Cooperative Organizations
    Henan Province Develops Credit Cooperatives in a Planned Way
    Before and after the autumn harvest in Liaoning Province, farmers in various places showed a great enthusiasm for organizing credit cooperatives. From October 1st to November 10th alone, more than 1.4 million farmers in only 27 cities and counties, including Jinzhou, Fuxian, and Gaiping, joined credit cooperatives. By the end of October, there were 714 newly established or soon-to-be-opened cooperatives in the province; adding the original credit cooperatives and credit departments, the total was 1,412. It is estimated that by the end of the year, the capital stock and deposits collected by credit cooperatives and credit departments will reach more than 177 billion yuan.
    The quality of the newly developed credit cooperatives and credit departments is generally very good. Party committees and people's governments at the county and district levels in various places attach importance to the leadership of credit cooperative work. Before establishing cooperatives, all counties trained cadres. A total of more than 2,500 people were trained in the province in August and September as cadres for establishing cooperatives, as well as old cooperative directors and accountants.
    At present, counties and districts where credit cooperation is becoming universal are emerging one after another. Yixian, Beizhen and other thirteen counties already have cooperatives in every village. In Gaiping County, hundreds of thousands of farmers have joined credit cooperatives, and the capital stock and deposits of 104 new and old cooperatives total 18.5 billion yuan. A strong rural financial network with the National Bank as its core has gradually taken shape throughout the province, and it will further support agricultural production, organize rural financial activities, and crack down on usurers through various business activities.

    In accordance with the needs of the development of the agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation movement, Henan Province has recently revised its plan for developing credit cooperative organizations this year. According to this plan, the province will develop more than 4,300 new cooperatives on the basis of the 5,651 credit cooperatives at the end of August, develop more than 4.16 million new members, and newly absorb more than 81.04 billion yuan of capital stock this year. By the end of this year, the number of credit cooperatives in the province can be developed to 10,000, and more than 74% of the townships in the province will have established credit cooperatives; the members of credit cooperatives will be more than 9 million, accounting for 37.23% of the population that should join; the capital stock will exceed 163.5 billion yuan.
    Generally, all localities have made specific arrangements for carrying out rural credit cooperative work when deploying winter work in accordance with this plan and local conditions. At present, areas where less than half of the townships have established credit cooperatives have begun to train cadres in large numbers and fully launch cooperative establishment work; areas where more than 80% of the townships have established cooperatives have begun to concentrate their efforts to eliminate "blank townships" in addition to consolidating the work of the old cooperatives; areas where every township has a cooperative are further improving and consolidating the existing credit cooperatives in coordination with the unified purchase of grain, cotton, and oil crops. By the end of September, 1,410 new credit cooperatives had been established in the province; together with the original cooperatives, there were a total of 7,061 credit cooperatives in the province, with a total of more than 6,402,000 members and more than 100.53 billion yuan of capital stock. There are more than 1,780 credit cooperatives in preparation, and more than 7.38 billion yuan of capital stock has been collected. (Xuan Jinnong)

    辽宁省成千上万农民参加信用合作组织
    河南省有计划地发展信用合作社
    辽宁省秋收前后，各地农民组织信用合作社的情绪十分高涨。从十月一日到十一月十日止，仅锦州、复县、盖平等二十七个市、县，就有一百四十多万农民加入了信用合作社。十月底，全省已开业或准备开业的新社有七百一十四个；加上原有的信用合作社、信用部，共计有一千四百一十二个。预计到年底，信用合作社和信用部收集的股金和吸收的存款，可达一千七百七十多亿元。
    最近新发展的信用合作社和信用部，质量一般都很好。各地县、区党委和人民政府都重视对信用合作工作的领导。各县在建社以前，都培养和训练了干部。全省在八、九月份训练的建社干部和老社主任、会计等，共有两千五百多人。
    目前，信用合作普遍化的县、区正陆续出现。义县、北镇等十三个县已是村村有社。盖平县有十几万农民加入了信用合作社，一百零四个新社、老社的股金和存款，共有一百八十五亿元。全省以国家银行为核心的强大的农村金融网已经逐步形成，它将通过各项业务活动，进一步扶助农业生产，组织农村金融活动，并打击高利贷者。

    河南省根据农业生产互助合作运动发展的需要，最近重新修订了今年发展信用合作组织的计划。根据这个计划，全省今年将在八月底的五千六百五十一个信用合作社的基础上，再发展新社四千三百多个，发展新社员四百一十六万多人，新吸收股金八百一十亿四千多万元。到今年年底，全省的信用合作社可以发展到一万个，全省百分之七十四以上的乡都将建立起信用合作社；信用合作社社员将有九百多万人，占应入社人口的百分之三十七点二三；股金将超过一千六百三十五亿元。
    各地一般都根据这一计划和当地具体情况，在布置冬季工作时，对开展农村信用合作工作作了具体安排。现在，建立信用合作社的乡还不足半数的地区，已着手大量训练干部，全面展开建社工作；百分之八十以上的乡都已建社的地区，除进行巩固老社的工作外，开始集中力量消灭“空白乡”；已经乡乡有社的地区，正配合粮食、棉花、油料的统购工作，进一步提高和巩固已有的信用合作社。到九月底止，全省又新建立信用合作社一千四百一十个；连同原有的社，全省共有信用合作社七千零六十一个，共有社员六百四十万二千多人、股金一千零五亿三千多万元。正在筹备成立的信用合作社，还有一千七百八十多个，已经收起的股金有七十三亿八千多万元。　　（宣金农）
