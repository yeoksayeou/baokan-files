    Shanxi Province's civil engineering and construction projects for basic construction this year are now largely completed, with the exception of some projects that require winter construction. This year, factory buildings, high-rise buildings, and high-grade structural projects accounted for a significant proportion of Shanxi Province's civil engineering and construction. These include the newly built 36-meter-high main building of the Taiyuan No. 1 Power Plant and its auxiliary projects, many newly built and expanded factory buildings for the Datong Cement Plant and the Taiyuan Wire Rod Plant, and ground buildings for many coal mines. Thanks to the extensive labor emulation campaign launched by basic construction workers throughout the province, the active promotion of advanced experiences, and the acceleration of construction progress, the quality of the projects has been basically guaranteed, and the cost of the projects has been reduced. For example, in Taiyuan City, 339 production teams from 11 construction units have reached or exceeded the new quotas. Workers in various units in Yangquan City have improved their labor efficiency by an average of 12% to 60% in 14 types of work such as bricklaying, tamping earth, scaffolding, and ceiling installation compared to last year. In October, the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant Engineering Department reduced the actual cost of the six completed projects by 21%. According to statistics, the basic construction departments throughout the province can save the state 118.4 billion yuan in funds just by reducing project costs.

    山西省今年土木建筑工程大部完工
    全省基本建设部门可给国家节约资金一千多亿元
    山西省今年施工的基本建设土木建筑工程，除部分需要进行冬季施工的工程外，目前已基本完工。今年山西省的土木建筑工程中，工厂场房和高层建筑及高级结构的工程，占相当大的比重。其中有新建太原第一发电厂三十六公尺高的主场房及其附属工程，有大同水泥厂、太原线材厂等许多新建和扩建的工厂场房工程，及许多煤矿的地面建筑工程。由于全省基本建设工人深入开展劳动竞赛，积极推广先进经验，加速了施工进度，基本上保证了工程质量，并降低了工程成本。如太原市十一个施工单位，有三百三十九个生产小组，达到和超过了新的定额，阳泉市各单位工人，在砌砖、打灰土、搭架、吊顶棚等十四个工种中，比去年的劳动效率平均提高了百分之十二至六十。太原钢铁厂工程处在十月份已完成的六项工程中，实际降低工程成本百分之二十一。据统计全省基本建设部门仅降低工程造价，就可给国家节约资金一千零一百八十四亿元。
