On the Typicality of the Jia Family and Other Matters
—A Discussion with Comrades Li Xifan and Lan Ling
She Shusheng

Li Xifan and Lan Ling were the first comrades to raise their spears against the bourgeois viewpoints that dominated the field of classical literature. Their criticism of Yu Pingbo's erroneous views on "A Dream of Red Mansions" was fundamentally correct. Precisely because it was the first shot, although this first shot hit the mark and played a significant role, it inevitably left some issues worth further exploration, and even contained some erroneous viewpoints on certain issues, which is not surprising.

In analyzing the social causes of the Jia family's decline and its typical significance, I believe that the opinions of Comrades Li Xifan and Lan Ling are incorrect. Here, I write down my views for everyone's correction.

Unlike all anti-Marxists, we believe that the Jia family in "A Dream of Red Mansions" is a typical phenomenon in reality, a family with typical characteristics during the period when the feudal ruling class was transitioning from prosperity to decline, from strength to death. Therefore, through the characteristic phenomena of the Jia family, we can foresee the inevitable collapse of the feudal ruling class. Comrades Li Xifan and Lan Ling mentioned this point.

It is very obvious that the Jia family's extravagant and corrupt life is an important phenomenon with its characteristic features. The question is, why does the Jia family's extremely luxurious and decadent life reveal the signs of the collapse of the feudal ruling group? I have differences of opinion with Comrades Li Xifan and Lan Ling here.

Comrades Li Xifan and Lan Ling believe that behind the extremely luxurious scenes of the Jia family's life, we can see: "How domestic and foreign industrial and commercial capital shook the economic foundation of the feudal rulers and led them to the path of collapse," believing that this "shows the historical fate of the inevitable demise of the aristocratic landlord class" [1]. I believe: the Jia family's extremely luxurious life can indeed show the historical fate of the collapse of the ruling group, but it can show the historical fate of the collapse of the ruling group, not because it represents "how domestic and foreign industrial and commercial capital shook the economic foundation of the feudal rulers," not because it represents "this class, in order to satisfy its luxurious enjoyment, had to rely on domestic and foreign industry and commerce to manufacture and import noble luxury goods for it" [2].

Although Comrades Li Xifan and Lan Ling also subjectively emphasized that it is necessary to study "A Dream of Red Mansions" from a specific analysis of the historical conditions that produced it, their analysis of why "A Dream of Red Mansions" can show the historical fate of the inevitable demise of the feudal ruling group is far removed from the characteristics of Chinese history and the specific characteristics of the historical conditions that produced "A Dream of Red Mansions."

The demise of each dynasty in China's thousands of years of feudal society has always been marked by the extreme luxury of the ruling group as a sign of its demise. The extreme luxury of the ruling group is a reflection of the extremely cruel economic exploitation and political oppression of the peasants by the ruling class, and this exploitation and oppression will inevitably arouse the armed revolutionary struggle of the peasant masses. Chairman Mao wrote in discussing this characteristic of Chinese feudal society: "The peasants of all dynasties in China lived a poor and miserable slave-like life under this feudal economic exploitation and feudal political oppression," and also said: "The extreme poverty and backwardness of the peasants caused by such cruel exploitation and oppression by the landlord class is the basic reason for the stagnation of Chinese society in terms of economy and social life for thousands of years" [3]. The extreme luxury of the landlord class shows the extreme cruelty of exploitation, and this extremely cruel exploitation determines the inevitable arrival of the revolutionary struggle of the peasants who rise up in revolt. This is what Chairman Mao said: "The landlord class's cruel economic exploitation and political oppression of the peasants forced the peasants to launch uprisings many times to resist the rule of the landlord class." [4]

It can be seen that: considering the reason why the extreme extravagance of the feudal ruling class in the era of "A Dream of Red Mansions" is a sign of the demise of a specific ruling group as being due to the development of industrial and commercial capital shaking the economic foundation of the feudal ruling class, is contrary to the characteristics of Chinese history.

Another characteristic of Chinese history is also manifested in the fact that the emperor of Chinese feudal society was the largest landowner in the country, and large-scale industry and commerce were also owned by the emperor. Therefore, this kind of industry and commerce has an essential difference from capitalist industry and commerce, and of course, the role it plays within feudal society is also fundamentally different from general industry and commerce with some capitalist characteristics. It is wrong to confuse the nature and role of the two. At the same time, Cao Xueqin's family history and "A Dream of Red Mansions" itself also show us this characteristic: Cao Xueqin's grandfather was the weaving manufacturer in Jiangning, mainly managing the textile industry run by the emperor for the exclusive use of the royal family; Lin Daiyu's father, Lin Ruhai, held the position of salt administration, which also shows that commerce was also monopolized by the royal nobles.

Comrades Li Xifan and Lan Ling's analysis of the significance of the inevitable demise of the feudal ruling group shown through the Jia family also departs from the specific historical conditions that produced "A Dream of Red Mansions." In order to prove that the development of industrial and commercial capital at that time was the fundamental force that shook the ruling foundation of the feudal ruling class, they also quoted Chairman Mao's following words as proof: "The development of commodity economy in Chinese feudal society had already nurtured the bud of capitalism. Without the influence of foreign capitalism, China would also have slowly developed into a capitalist society."

However, the actual emergence of capitalism requires two preconditions, namely the primitive accumulation of capital and the free market for selling labor. Chairman Mao believed that the two preconditions for the emergence of capitalist society in China appeared only after the Opium War. Chairman Mao said in discussing the great impact of the Opium War on the nature of Chinese feudal society: "These situations not only played a disintegrating role in the foundation of China's feudal economy, but also created certain objective conditions and possibilities for the development of Chinese capitalist production. Because the destruction of the natural economy created a market for commodities for capitalism, and the bankruptcy of a large number of peasants and handicraftsmen created a market for labor for capitalism." [5]

It can be seen that the statement of Comrades Li Xifan and Lan Ling that "domestic and foreign industrial and commercial capital" "shook" the "economic foundation of the feudal rulers" in the era of Cao Xueqin and as expressed in "A Dream of Red Mansions" is contrary to the economic characteristics of the era in which "A Dream of Red Mansions" was produced.

Comrades Li Xifan and Lan Ling simply start from the abstract definition of the theory that the destruction of feudal society is due to the emergence and growth of capitalism, depart from the characteristics of Chinese history, depart from the specific social conditions that produced "A Dream of Red Mansions," and depart from the characteristics expressed in "A Dream of Red Mansions," to analyze the significance of "A Dream of Red Mansions" as a predictor of the inevitable collapse of the feudal ruling class, and therefore they came to the above-mentioned erroneous conclusion.

Because of this, it is no wonder that they regarded the "confiscation of the house," which is of great significance to the Jia family, only as an "individual accidental cause."

Since the Jia family is a typical family within the ruling group, then the "confiscation of the house," which is of great significance to the Jia family, cannot but be an event related to certain essential things in society, and cannot but be an event that most fully and sharply expresses the essential things of a certain social force. Therefore, thinking that the Jia family's "as for the confiscation of the house, this is an individual accidental cause," denying the connection between the Jia family's "confiscation" and certain essential things in reality, is in effect equivalent to denying the typicality of the Jia family or will inevitably lead to denying the typicality of the Jia family.

Comrade Malenkov once pointed out that the question of the typical is a political question, and that typicality is the basic category of party spirit in realistic art. Therefore, the struggle between bourgeois thought and proletarian thought in the practice of literary theory and literary creation cannot but be concentrated on the struggle over the recognition or denial of the typical. Isn't our struggle with the erroneous viewpoints of the bourgeois Hu Shi and Mr. Yu Pingbo, the direct follower of Hu Shi, concentrated on this issue?

Comrades Li Xifan and Lan Ling admit the typicality of the Jia family, admit that the signs of the death of the feudal ruling group can be seen through the luxurious life of the Jia family, and point out that "behind this luxurious scene, hides the blood and sweat of millions of peasants." Unfortunately, they just barely touched the essence of the problem, and then drifted away again.

The actual situation of Chinese feudal society in the mid-18th century was: due to the continuous large-scale foreign aggressive wars by the Manchu Qing rulers, and due to the ruling class's unprecedentedly cruel economic exploitation and political oppression of the peasants in order to satisfy their extravagant and decadent lives, the peasant uprisings had already begun to brew.

From the life of the Jia family written in "A Dream of Red Mansions," we can also see that the extravagant and corrupt life of the feudal ruling group has reached its extreme, and the cruel exploitation of the peasants, the crazy usury activities, the collusion with the government, the contracting of lawsuits, and the seizing of property through trickery, all of this irrefutably proves that the feudal ruling group's economic exploitation and political oppression of the peasants has reached an extremely cruel state. Furthermore, through the poor life of the peasants and ordinary poor citizens reflected in "A Dream of Red Mansions," the "taking risks" activities of the urban lumpenproletariat, and the people's hatred for the Jia family, we can feel that the sparks of the peasant uprising are about to become a prairie fire.

The true meaning of the inevitable demise of the feudal ruling group shown through the Jia family, this typical family, lies here.

How should we understand the typical significance of the Jia family's confiscation of the house?

Since the Jia family is a typical family standing at the forefront of the conflict between the feudal ruling group and the ruled, then when the conflict between the rulers and the ruled reaches its sharpest point, when the ruling class's throne is not easy to maintain, the ruling group will strike at certain families within its own ranks that stand at the forefront of the class conflict, in order to alleviate class contradictions and maintain its own ruling power.

This is the fundamental reason for the Jia family's confiscation of the house.

It can be seen that: the Jia family's confiscation of the house most fully and sharply expresses the essential things of a certain social force. Its typical significance lies in the fact that the confiscation of the Jia family more vividly expresses the sharpness of class struggle.

It can be seen that: It is wrong for Comrades Li Xifan and Lan Ling to regard the confiscation of the Jia family merely as an "individual accidental cause." This violates the principles of realism.

Are there any other reasons for the Jia family's confiscation of the house?

The reasons for the Jia family's confiscation of the house are not simple. The Jia family's confiscation of the house is also the result of the development of contradictions within the ruling group. First of all, it is the result of the development of contradictions between the royal family group and the local landlord group. For example, Jia Zheng, representing the interests of the royal family group, held the position of Jiangxi grain transport officer, and was later impeached and dismissed by the emperor. This incident fully illustrates the sharpness of the contradictions between the royal family group and the local landlord group. In order to achieve the unity of the ruling class to deal with the rising peasant uprising, the royal family group had to painfully make major concessions to the local landlord group and withdraw its rent collector—Jia Zheng. The Jia family's confiscation of the house was also the result of the contradiction between Jia Zheng and the core group of the royal family—eunuchs, assistant ministers, etc. It was also the result of mutual infighting between colleagues.

These are some other reasons for the Jia family's confiscation of the house. These reasons are still typically significant. Through these contradictions, we can see that the disintegration within the ruling class has reached a high degree, thereby adding another layer of meaning to the inevitability of the demise of the ruling group shown through the Jia family's confiscation of the house.

However, Comrades Li Xifan and Lan Ling believe: "The confiscation of the Zhen family and the impending confiscation of the Jia family described and implied in 'A Dream of Red Mansions' are by no means merely due to embezzlement of public funds, but behind them lie political factors. The rise and fall of certain nobles is transferred by the success and failure of the political group to which they belong, especially by the relationship with the emperor. This was common during the Manchu Qing Dynasty, especially the Yongzheng Dynasty. The decline of the nobles who had close relations with the Jia family described in 'A Dream of Red Mansions' is closely related to such a political background." [6] Undeniably, the Jia family's confiscation of the house is closely related to the historical facts discussed by Comrades Li Xifan and Lan Ling, but for us, the important question lies in understanding that the Jia family's "confiscation" has the artistic typical significance, that is to say, it is not a true historical record or a simple reproduction of historical events. The significance of the typical is not because it is a "common thing," as Comrades Li Xifan and Lan Ling said. Comrade Malenkov has already said: "The typical is not only the most common thing," and also said, "The typical is by no means a statistical average."

The "political factors" of the Jia family's confiscation of the house pointed out by Comrades Li Xifan and Lan Ling would even be gladly agreed to by Yu Pingbo. This conclusion is consistent with the conclusion reached by Mr. Zhou Ruchang, who studied "A Dream of Red Mansions" directly under the influence of Hu Shi and Yu Pingbo's bourgeois thought, in his textual research on the reasons for the Jia family's confiscation of the house and the confiscation of the houses of the nobles related to the Jia family. Is this a mere coincidence? Absolutely not. This practice of mechanically equating the Jia family's confiscation of the house with the historical situation at that time, in essence, still belongs to the category of bourgeois naturalistic viewpoints. By doing so, the typical significance of the Jia family's confiscation of the house is actually extracted. This shows that in the understanding of the typicality of the Jia family and the typicality and significance of the Jia family's confiscation of the house, Comrades Li Xifan and Lan Ling have still not shaken off the influence of bourgeois viewpoints.

It can be seen that the struggle to eliminate the influence of bourgeois thought in the study of classical literature is such an arduous and complex task! Unite and wage a more resolute battle against bourgeois thought!

    关于贾家的典型性及其它
    ——向李希凡、蓝翎两同志商榷
    佘树声
    对在古典文学领域中占据统治地位的资产阶级观点第一次举起了投枪的，是李希凡、蓝翎两位同志。他们对俞平伯的“红楼梦研究”的错误观点的批判，基本上是正确的。唯其因为它是第一枪，尽管这第一枪击中了要害，起了很大的作用，却也不可避免地留下了若干值得进一步探讨的问题，甚至在某些问题上也包含着一些错误的观点，这并不是什么奇怪的事。
    在分析贾家衰败的社会原因及其典型意义上，我认为李希凡、蓝翎两同志的意见就是错误的。这里，我把我的看法写出，请大家指正。
    我们和一切反马克思主义者相反，我们认为“红楼梦”中的贾家是现实中的典型现象，是封建统治阶级由盛转衰、由强大转向死亡时期的具有典型性的家族，因之通过贾家的特征性的现象，就能够预示封建统治阶级必然溃灭的命运。这一点，李希凡、蓝翎两位同志是说到了。
    十分明显贾家的穷奢极欲的腐化生活是它的具有特征性的重要的现象。问题就在于为什么通过贾家的极度奢华的腐朽生活就显示了封建统治集团的溃灭的征兆呢？我和李希凡、蓝翎两同志在这里便有了意见的分歧。
    李希凡、蓝翎两同志认为在贾家的极度豪华的生活场景的背后，能够看出：“国内外的工商业资本怎样动摇着封建统治者的经济基础，怎样把它导向崩溃的道路上去”，认为从这里就“显示出贵族地主阶级必然灭亡的历史命运”〔一〕。我认为：通过贾家的极度的豪华生活是能显示出统治集团的溃灭的历史命运的，但是它所以能显示出统治集团溃灭的历史命运，并不是因为它表示了“国内外的工商业资本怎样动摇着封建统治者的经济基础”，不是因为它表示了“这个阶级为了满足自己豪华的享受，又不得不依靠内外工商业为其制造和输入高贵的奢侈品”〔二〕。
    李希凡、蓝翎两同志虽然在主观上也强调说应该从产生“红楼梦”的历史条件的具体分析上来研究它，但是他们对“红楼梦”之所以能够显示出封建统治集团必然灭亡的历史命运的分析，却远远离开了中国历史的特点与产生“红楼梦”的历史条件的具体特点。
    中国几千年的封建社会的每一朝代的灭亡，总是以统治集团的极度的豪华生活为其灭亡的征兆的。统治集团的极度的豪华生活，乃是统治阶级对农民的极端残酷的经济剥削与政治压迫的反映，而这种剥削和压迫是必然会激起农民群众的武装革命斗争的。毛主席在论述中国封建社会的这种特点时写道：“中国历代的农民，就在这种封建的经济剥削和封建的政治压迫之下，过着贫穷困苦的奴隶式的生活”，又说：“地主阶级这样残酷的剥削和压迫所造成的农民的极端的穷苦和落后，就是中国社会几千年在经济上和社会生活上停滞不前的基本原因”〔三〕。地主阶级的极度的豪华生活，说明了剥削的极度的残酷，而这种极为残酷的剥削，又决定了农民的揭竿而起的革命斗争的必将到来。这就是毛主席所说的：“地主阶级对于农民的残酷的经济剥削和政治压迫，迫使农民多次地举行起义，以反抗地主阶级的统治。”〔四〕
    由此可见：把“红楼梦”时代的封建统治阶级的穷极奢侈之所以是特定的统治集团灭亡的征兆，认为是由于工商业资本的发展动摇了封建统治阶级的经济基础，是违背了中国的历史特点的。
    中国历史的另一特点，还表现在中国封建社会的皇帝，是全国最大的土地所有者，较大规模的工商业也是皇帝所有的。因之这种工商业和资本主义的工商业有着本质的区别，当然它在封建社会的内部所起的作用也就和一般的带有若干资本主义性质的工商业有着原则的不同了，将二者的性质与作用混同起来是错误的。同时，曹雪芹的家世和“红楼梦”本身也向我们表明了这一特点：曹雪芹的祖父是江宁的织造，主要的是管理皇帝办的专供皇室之用的纺织工业；林黛玉的父亲林如海为盐政之职，这也表明了商业同样的也是为皇室贵族所垄断了的。
    李希凡、蓝翎两同志对于通过贾家所显示出的封建统治集团的必然死亡的意义的分析，也离开了产生“红楼梦”的具体的历史条件。他们为了证明当时工商业资本的发展是动摇封建统治阶级的统治基础的根本力量，还引用了毛主席的如下的话作为证明：“中国封建社会内商品经济的发展，已经孕育着资本主义的萌芽，如果没有外国资本主义的影响，中国也将缓慢地发展到资本主义社会。”
    但是，资本主义的实际产生是需要两个前提的，即资本的原始积累与出卖劳动的自由市场。毛主席认为在中国产生资本主义社会的两个前提是在鸦片战争以后才出现的。毛主席在论述鸦片战争对中国封建社会性质的巨大影响时说道：“这些情形，不仅对中国封建经济的基础起了解体的作用，同时又给中国资本主义生产的发展造成了某些客观的条件和可能。因为自然经济的破坏，给资本主义造成了商品的市场，而大量农民和手工业者的破产，又给资本主义造成了劳动力的市场。”〔五〕
    可见，李希凡和蓝翎两位同志认为在曹雪芹的时代以及在“红楼梦”中所表现的是“国内外的工商业资本”“动摇”了“封建统治者的经济基础”的说法，是违背了产生“红楼梦”的时代的经济特点的。
    李希凡和蓝翎同志单纯地从封建社会的破坏是由于资本主义的产生和壮大这一理论的抽象定义出发，离开了中国历史的特点，离开了产生“红楼梦”的具体的社会条件，也离开了“红楼梦”所表现的特点，去分析“红楼梦”作为封建统治阶级必然溃灭的预言者的意义，因而他们就得出了上述的错误的结论。
    正因如此，无怪乎他们把对于贾家来说有着重要意义的“被抄”只当作“个别的偶然的原因”了。
    贾家既然是统治集团内部的具有典型性的家族，那么对于贾家来说有着重大意义的“被抄”，也就不能不是和一定的社会的本质事物相联系的事件，不能不是最充分、最尖锐地表现一定社会力量的本质事物的事件。因之，认为贾家的“至于抄家，这倒是个别的偶然的原因”，否认贾家的“被抄”和现实中的一定的本质事物的联系，在实际上就等于否认贾家的典型性或者说必将导引至否认贾家的典型性。
    马林科夫同志曾经指出：典型的问题是一个政治性的问题，典型性是党性在现实主义艺术中表现的基本范畴。因而在文艺理论与文艺创作的实践上资产阶级思想与无产阶级思想的斗争便不能不集中在关于典型的承认与否认的斗争上。难道我们和资产阶级的胡适和胡适的直接追随者俞平伯先生的错误观点的斗争不是集中在这个问题上吗？
    李希凡、蓝翎两同志承认贾家的典型性，承认通过贾家的豪华奢侈的生活能够看出封建统治集团死亡的征兆，并且指出在这种“豪华的生活场面的背后，正隐藏着千百万农民的血汗”。可惜，他们刚刚快要接触到问题的本质时，便又飘然而去了。
    十八世纪中叶中国封建社会的实际情况是：由于满清统治者连年地大规模地对外进行侵略战争，由于统治阶级为了满足他们的穷奢极欲的生活，对农民的经济剥削与政治压迫便空前地残酷了，农民的起义活动已经开始酝酿了。
    从“红楼梦”所写的贾家的生活中，我们也可以看出封建统治集团的穷奢极欲的腐化生活已经达到了极点，对农民的残酷剥削，疯狂的高利贷活动，勾结官府、包揽讼词、巧取豪夺，通过这一切，无可辩驳地证明了封建统治集团对农民的经济剥削和政治压迫已经达到了极端残酷的境地了。再通过
  “红楼梦”里所反映的农民和一般穷苦市民的穷困生活，城市流氓无产者的“挺而走险”的活动，以及人们对贾家的仇恨，我们可以感到农民起义的星星之火即将成为燎原之势了。
    通过贾家这一典型性的家族所显示的封建统治集团必然溃灭的命运的真实意义就在这里。
    应如何理解贾家的被抄的典型意义呢？
    贾家既然是立于封建统治集团和被统治者冲突的尖端的典型性的家族，那么当统治者和被统治者的冲突达到尖锐化的时候，当统治阶级的统治宝座不易保持的时候，统治集团为了缓和阶级矛盾，为了保持自己的统治权，就向立于阶级冲突的尖端的自己内部的某些家族开刀了。
    这就是贾家被抄的根本原因。
    由此可见：贾家的被抄是最充分最尖锐地表现了一定社会力量的本质事物的。它的典型意义就在于通过贾家的被抄更加鲜明地表现了阶级斗争的尖锐性。
    由此可见：李希凡和蓝翎同志将贾家的被抄仅仅当作“个别的偶然的原因”是错误的，在这一点上是违背了现实主义的原则的。
    至于贾家的被抄是不是还有其他的原因呢？
    贾家被抄的原因是并不单纯的。贾家的被抄也是统治集团内部矛盾发展的结果。首先是皇室集团和地方性的地主集团矛盾发展的结果，如贾政代表皇室集团的利益担任江西粮道之职，后由于被参而被皇帝罢免，这件事就充分地说明皇室集团和地方的地主集团的矛盾的尖锐，皇室集团为了取得统治阶级内部的统一以对付日益高涨的农民起义不得不忍痛对地方性的地主集团作了重大的让步，把自己的收租人——贾政——撤回。贾家的被抄也同时是贾政和皇室的核心集团——太监、侍郎等——矛盾的结果。也还是同僚之间互相倾轧的结果。
    这就是贾家被抄的其他的一些原因。这些原因仍然是有典型意义的，通过这些矛盾可以看到统治阶级内部的分崩离析已经达到了高度，从而通过贾家的被抄所显示的统治集团灭亡的不可避免性便又多了一层意义。
    但是李希凡、蓝翎两同志却认为：“‘红楼梦’中所描写与所暗示的甄家被抄家与贾家的将被抄家，绝不仅仅是因亏空公款，而背后就隐藏着政治的因素。某些贵族的兴衰是以它所属的政治集团的得势与失败为转移的，特别是以与皇帝的关系为转移，这在满清统治时代，尤其是雍正王朝是屡见不鲜的事。‘红楼梦’中所描写的与贾家有亲密关系的诸贵族的衰落，与这样的政治背景是有着密切关系的。”〔六〕无可否认，贾家的被抄是和李希凡、蓝翎两同志所论述的历史事实是有着密切关系的，但是对我们来说，重要的问题在于了解贾家的“被抄”是具有艺术的典型性的意义的，就是说它不是历史的真实的记录与历史事件的单纯的再现。典型的意义不是因为它是“屡见不鲜的事”，如李希凡、蓝翎同志所说的。马林科夫同志已经讲过：“典型不仅是最常见的事物”，又说“典型绝不是某种统计的平均数”。
    李希凡、蓝翎两同志所指出的贾家被抄的“政治因素”，即使是俞平伯也会欣然同意的，这一结论和另一位直接在胡适、俞平伯的资产阶级思想影响之下研究“红楼梦”的周汝昌先生在贾家被抄和与贾家有关的诸贵族的被抄的原因的考证上，所得到的结论是一致的。这难道是偶然的巧合吗？绝不是。这种将贾家被抄与当时的历史情况机械地等同起来的做法，在实质上仍然属于资产阶级的自然主义观点范畴之内。这样做，就是在实际上抽去了贾家被抄的典型意义。这说明在对贾家的典型性及贾家被抄的典型性及其意义的认识上，李希凡和蓝翎同志也仍然没有摆脱资产阶级观点的影响。
    可见，清除古典文学研究中的资产阶级思想影响的斗争是一件多么艰巨、复杂的任务！团结起来，对资产阶级思想进行更坚决的战斗吧！
