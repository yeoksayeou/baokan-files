We should strengthen technical supervision during construction.
Li Zhi

Strengthening technical supervision during construction is an important Soviet experience in ensuring project quality. Technical supervision during construction refers to the establishment of a technical supervision organization by the construction unit (also known as Party A) alone or by both the construction unit and the construction contractor (also known as Party B) to inspect each stage of the construction process, ensuring that construction operations comply with construction regulations and design requirements, and that project quality meets design standards. Therefore, it can identify problems during construction in advance and plug loopholes that could lead to quality accidents.

Experience has shown that neglecting technical supervision during construction is often the root cause of various major quality accidents. We have begun to implement a technical supervision system on some construction sites, but its implementation is not widespread or strict enough, and some construction sites do not yet attach importance to this work. Recently, a construction site had two serious construction quality accidents. The construction site is building a giant factory building of more than 20,000 square meters. One quality accident was the unauthorized modification of the design, shortening the steel roof truss by ten centimeters. As a result, the steel roof truss could not be installed, so it had to be spliced, forced into place, and the rivet holes were burned with a gas flame to speed up the process, which is not allowed by construction specifications. As a result, the strength of the steel structure was greatly damaged, so that the trolley originally intended to be hung on the roof frame could no longer be hung, and steel columns had to be installed to bear the weight of the crane, wasting funds and shortening the life of the factory building. Another quality accident was that dozens of reinforced concrete columns in the factory building were poorly poured, with most of them exhibiting honeycombing, pitting, and exposed rebar. The worst column had pitting on all four sides, with the largest pit being 2.2 meters long, 45 centimeters wide, and 10 centimeters deep, exposing more than a dozen rebars. Because the strength of the columns was severely damaged, the load on the columns could only be reduced, seriously affecting the life of the factory building.

When analyzing the responsibility for these two quality accidents, Soviet experts pointed out that such serious accidents, in addition to exposing the construction unit's lack of experience, low technical level, and chaotic management system, also stemmed from the factory's lack of strict technical supervision of the construction. Obviously, modifying the design of the steel roof truss and shortening the truss are major issues of principle, and the construction unit cannot easily make decisions on its own. If Party A could study the drawings in detail, adhere to principles, and promptly raise opinions to the design unit, this accident would never have happened. The quality accident of the reinforced concrete columns was caused by the construction unit disregarding operating procedures, improper concrete mixing ratios, and failure to compact the concrete during pouring. Reinforced concrete columns are the lifeline of a factory building, and Party A must carry out strict technical supervision during pouring. If Party A's technical supervision staff could go deep into the construction site and carefully examine and study each step of the construction, they would certainly be able to stop this serious error that violated technical regulations.

Soviet experts sincerely told us that in the future, the number of construction projects in various places will increase, the amount of work will be large, and the content of the projects will be complex. There will be many giant factory buildings and automated equipment that China has never seen before. These projects, especially the 141 enterprise projects, are the foundation of China's industry and the lifeline of China's first five-year plan. Ensuring the construction quality of these projects is an extremely important task. Without strong technical supervision, major accidents may occur, causing irreparable losses to the country. Strengthening technical supervision should become an urgent task.

However, some of our comrades have very incorrect views on technical supervision during construction. Some people say, "The construction units now are all state-owned construction enterprises, and they are all responsible to the state. Why is it still necessary to implement technical supervision?" This view does not fully appreciate that the technical level of our construction enterprises is not high, there is a lack of experience in management, and subjectivism and bureaucracy still exist in some places. The phenomenon of only pursuing rapid progress and neglecting construction quality is not limited to individual construction units. And these are important reasons for damaging project quality. Technical supervision of construction is to fight against various technical, management, ideological backwardness and conservatism, and constantly improve project quality and construction speed.

Other comrades propose: "Many experiences have proven that in order to do a good job in project construction, it is necessary to have good unity between Party A and Party B. Will strict technical supervision cause tension between Party A and Party B, which is not conducive to the project?" This view is due to a failure to recognize what is the foundation and purpose of unity. Doing a good job of unity is to ensure that the project is built well, quickly, and economically. Unity that loses this fundamental purpose is meaningless. Now, the relationship between Party A and Party B in construction is not a capitalist-style employment relationship, but a friendly relationship under the unified leadership of the state, fighting for the same goal. As long as the technical requirements insisted upon by Party A are reasonable and possible, although certain dissatisfaction or avoidance of difficulties may be encountered, as long as necessary discussions and explanations are conducted, it will never affect unity.

The main weapons of technical supervision are two things: one is the construction design drawing, and the other is the construction acceptance specification.

In addition to studying and mastering the above two main weapons, cadres engaged in technical supervision should also pay attention to the following aspects based on our experience:

(1) Oppose construction personnel being self-righteous and modifying the design without authorization. Because our design technical force is weak, some design personnel still have erroneous design ideas and outdated design theories, or the collection of original design data is not sufficient, there are often shortcomings such as the design not conforming to the actual situation, wasting materials, being inconvenient to construct, or even being impossible to construct. Sometimes, due to the carelessness of the design personnel, there are often errors in the drawings, such as inconsistencies in various dimensions, inconsistencies between plan views and sectional views, and other details. If this situation is found during construction, the construction unit should raise it, and personnel from both Party A and Party B should jointly study the nature of the error. If it is an individual detail error that can be analyzed and corrected from the drawing itself, it can be modified with the consent of both Party A and Party B, and the modification opinions can be sent to the design unit. If it is a major error in the design, or the design does not conform to the actual site conditions, it is necessary to report to the design unit and ask them to modify it, or send representatives to the construction site to modify it according to the site conditions. Without the permission of the design unit, it is not permissible to modify the design without authorization, especially when it involves structural calculations. The example mentioned earlier of a construction site shortening the steel roof truss by ten centimeters, so that the steel frame could not be installed on the roof, is a serious evil consequence of unauthorized modification of the design.

(2) Oppose accommodating backwardness and lowering design requirements. Now, some construction personnel often raise opinions that they cannot meet the design requirements and request to lower the design requirements. Sometimes, this is just an excuse to avoid difficulties. It should be recognized that lowering design requirements is often an important factor in damaging project quality. When implementing certain new design standards, there is often a reluctance to repeatedly test. This emotion is also very harmful. If a new design requirement is not successful after testing, the construction unit should not arbitrarily decide to lower the requirement, but must obtain the consent of the design unit. In this regard, Soviet experts have set a good example for us. This year, we promoted cement-reinforced light roof panels on a certain construction site. The construction site repeatedly failed in trials, and Party A and Party B first reported to the Soviet experts in charge of basic construction management and requested modification. However, the Soviet experts believed that the design could not be arbitrarily modified, nor could the experiment be terminated. Later, they repeatedly asked the Soviet design experts to modify it. In addition to studying the manufacturing difficulties and proposing reference opinions, the Soviet design experts still insisted on the experiment. Finally, the trial was successful and could be mass-produced. Because this type of roof panel is very light, it can reduce the load on the steel roof frame and save a lot of steel for the country.

The materials specified in the design should also strictly comply with the design requirements and cannot be arbitrarily modified or substituted. In this regard, some situations that emphasize difficulties may also be encountered. For example, in a project on a construction site, the design stipulated that a metal waterproof layer should be used, that is, a very thin aluminum foil asphalt felt board. The construction unit and Party A both believed that they had never done it before, it was difficult to purchase, and they insisted on using tar-coated sacks instead, and proposed to "suspend work and wait for a decision." Later, after repeated explanations by the design unit, and after proposing the technical requirements and practices of aluminum foil asphalt felt board, various material processing factories were finally found in the area, and the quality of the products made was very good. Soviet experts told us that if tar-soaked sacks were really used as a substitute, the project might be infiltrated by groundwater, and the entire project would be completely unusable after it was built.

(3) Oppose following old habits, cutting corners and seeking quick results, and violating construction technical specifications. Whether it is earthwork engineering, brick and stone engineering, concrete and reinforced concrete engineering, or steel structure engineering, there are specific construction technical specifications to follow. The "Provisional Technical Specification for Construction and Acceptance of General Civil Engineering and Construction Projects" published by the former Northeast Industrial Department is a specification that is worth advocating and adopting. It is necessary to construct in accordance with these specifications to ensure quality. The aforementioned factory’s situation of most reinforced concrete columns having pitting and exposed rebars was caused by failure to strictly comply with the requirements of the specifications. When mixing concrete, they arbitrarily added water. The mixed concrete was not poured into the columns for a long time, resulting in sedimentation of sand and gravel and uneven slurry. When pouring concrete, they did not pour it in sections and use vibrators to compact it. These results of seeking quick results caused serious quality accidents.

(4) Strictly carry out technical supervision of concealed works and sample testing. Each concealed work needs to be inspected before it can be covered. The more important parts need to be tested. For example, when pouring reinforced concrete, sample block tests must be done. The erroneous practice of being careful and cautious when doing sample block tests, while being careless and sloppy when actually operating and constructing, must be opposed. A certain construction site made reinforced concrete roof panels. Because the rebars were shortened, the stress points could only rely on the edges of the concrete blocks without rebars. After being moved to the roof, they collapsed. Later, each piece was inspected and it was found that most of them were unqualified, causing a serious accident of scrapping thousands of roof panels. This was entirely caused by mass production without sample testing, and without strict inspection during actual operation.

In order to strictly do a good job in technical supervision during construction, the responsibilities of the personnel in charge of construction technical supervision are heavy. They must do the following:

First, study the design drawings in detail, so as to discover problems in advance and understand the main problems of individual projects. Not only must they study the drawings themselves, but they must also jointly study the drawings with Party B's construction personnel.

Second, be familiar with the technical specifications for construction acceptance, master various testing methods, and be familiar with operating procedures. Not only learn from books, but also pay attention to the advanced experience on the construction site and the advanced experience introduced in newspapers and magazines.

Third, have a high sense of responsibility and carefully carry out inspection and supervision.

Fourth, often conduct technical supervision deeply on site. However, this does not mean pointing fingers and directing construction on site; but to put forward opinions through certain procedures and systems.

    应该加强施工中的技术监督工作
    立之
    加强施工中的技术监督，是苏联保证工程质量的重要经验。所谓施工中的技术监督，就是由建设单位（又称甲方）单方面，或由建设单位和施工单位（又称乙方）双方面，组成技术监督组织，检查施工的每一程序，使施工操作符合施工规程和设计要求，保证工程质量达到设计标准。因之，它能在事先发现施工中的问题，堵塞各种可能发生质量事故的漏洞。
    经验证明：忽视施工中的技术监督，常常是造成各种重大质量事故的根由。现在我们在某些工地上已开始推行技术监督制度，但是推行得不够普遍，不够严格，有些工地上还没有重视这一工作。最近有一个工地曾发生了两次严重的施工质量事故。该工地正在建筑一幢两万多平方公尺的巨型厂房。一次质量事故是擅自修改设计，将钢屋架截短了十公分，结果钢屋架装不上，不得不拼接一段，勉强装上去，而且赶工图快，用气体火焰烧铆钉孔，这是施工规范所不容许的。结果钢结构强度大受损害，以致原来可以挂在房架上的挂车不能再挂，需要另设钢柱子承受吊车荷重，浪费了资金，缩短了厂房的寿命。另一次质量事故是该厂房数十根钢筋混凝土柱子浇灌得不好，大部分发生了蜂窝、麻面和露钢筋等情况，最坏的柱子是四面麻面，其中最大的麻面长达二点二公尺，宽四十五公分，深十公分，露出来的钢筋有十多根。由于柱子强度受到严重损害，只能减轻柱子上的荷重，严重地影响了厂房的寿命。
    苏联专家分析这两次质量事故的责任时指出：像这样严重的事故，除开暴露出施工单位的经验不足、技术水平低和管理制度混乱等外，从工厂方面来说，缺乏对施工的严格的技术监督，也是其中一项重要原因。很明显，修改钢屋架设计，截短屋架，这是重大的原则问题，施工单位不能单独地轻意作出决定。如果甲方能详尽地研究图纸，坚持原则，并及时向设计单位提出意见，是决不可能发生这次事故的。钢筋混凝土柱子的质量事故，是由于施工单位不顾操作规程、混凝土的掺合比例不当、浇灌混凝土时未加捣实等所致。钢筋混凝土柱子是一幢厂房的命脉，浇灌的时候，甲方必须进行严格的技术监督，这一次如果甲方的技术监督工作人员能深入工地，认真地检查研究施工的每一步骤，也一定能制止这种违反技术规程的严重错误。
    苏联专家十分恳切地告诉我们：今后各地的施工项目日益增多，工程量大，工程内容复杂，有很多是中国从来没有过的巨型厂房和自动化装备。这些工程，特别是一百四十一项企业内的工程，是中国工业的基础，是中国第一个五年计划里的命根子，保证这些工程的施工质量，是一项极为重要的任务。如果没有强有力的技术监督，就可能造成重大事故，给国家造成难以补偿的损失。加强技术监督，应该成为刻不容缓的工作。
    但是，我们有些同志对施工中的技术监督却有着很不正确的看法。有的人说：“现在的施工单位都是国家经营的建筑企业，都是向国家负责的，为什么还要实行技术监督呢？”这种看法是没有充分地估计到：我们的建筑企业的技术水平是不高的，管理工作上缺乏经验，有的地方仍然存在着主观主义和官僚主义。只图进度迅速，忽视施工质量，也不只是个别建筑单位有的现象。而这些正是有损工程质量的重要原因，对施工的技术监督，就是要向各种技术上、管理上和思想上的落后现象和保守现象作斗争，不断地提高工程质量和建设速度。
    另一些同志提出：“很多经验证明，为搞好工程施工，必须搞好甲乙双方的团结。严格的技术监督会促使甲乙双方关系紧张，不是对工程不利吗？”这种看法是由于没有认清什么是团结的基础和目的。搞好团结，是为了保证工程建设得好、快、省，失去了这个根本目的的团结，是没有任何意义的。现在施工中的甲乙双方，并不是资本主义式的雇佣关系，而是在国家统一领导下，为着同一目标斗争的友谊关系。只要甲方所坚持的技术要求是合理的和可能的，虽说可能遇到某些不满或躲避困难的情况，但只要进行必要的讨论和解释，是决不会影响团结的。
    技术监督的主要武器有两件，一件是施工设计图，另一件是施工验收规范。
    进行技术监督的干部除开要研究和掌握上述两件主要武器外，根据我们的体会，还要注意以下几方面：
    （一）反对施工人员自以为是，擅自修改设计。由于目前我们的设计技术力量薄弱、某些设计人员还有着错误的设计思想和陈旧的设计理论、或对设计原始资料搜集得不够充足，因而常有设计不符现实情况，浪费材料，不便于施工，甚至不能施工等缺点。有时由于设计人员粗枝大叶，图纸上也常有各种尺寸不符、平面图和剖面图不符等细节的错误。在施工中，如果发现这种情况，施工单位应该提出，由甲乙双方的人员共同研究其错误的性质，如果是个别的细节错误，可以从图纸本身中分析和修正的，则可在甲乙双方同意下，进行修改，并将修改意见寄送设计单位。如果是设计中的重大错误，或者设计同现场实际情况不符，则需要向设计单位反映，并请其修改，或派代表至工地根据现场情况进行修改。未经设计单位许可，是不能容许擅自修改设计的，特别是牵连到结构计算的时候，更不能任意修改。前面举出的某工地将钢屋架截短了十公分，以致钢架不能装上房顶的例子，就是擅自修改设计的严重恶果。
    （二）反对迁就落后，降低设计要求。现在有一些施工人员，常常提出不能达到设计要求，请求降低设计要求的意见，有时，这只是一种躲避困难的借口。应该认识，降低设计要求，常常是一种损害工程质量的重要因素。在推行某些新的设计标准时，也常常遇到一种不愿反复试验的情绪，这种情绪也是十分有害的。一种新的设计要求，如果经过试验不成功时，不应该由施工单位武断地决定降低要求，而必须经过设计单位的同意。在这方面，苏联专家给我们做出了良好的榜样。今年我们曾在某工地推行水泥钢筋轻型屋面板，该工地屡经试验不成功，甲乙双方先向负责基本建设管理的苏联专家反映，请求修改，但苏联专家认为不能任意修改设计，也不能终止试验。以后他们又几次要求苏联设计专家修改，苏联设计专家除了研究制造上的困难，提出参考的意见外，仍坚持要试验，最后终于试制成功，而且可以大量试造了。这一种屋面板，因为很轻，能使钢房架上面的荷重减轻，为国家节省大量钢材。
    设计中所规定的材料，也应该严格遵守设计要求，不能任意修改代用，这方面也可能遇到一些强调困难的情况。例如，某工地一项工程中，设计中规定要使用金属防水层，即一种极薄的铝箔油毡板。施工单位和甲方都认为从未做过，难以采购，一定要求用涂焦油的麻袋代替，并且提出要“停工等待决定”。后来，经过设计单位反复解释，并且提出了铝箔油毡板的技术要求和做法，终于在该地找到了各种材料加工的工厂，而且做出来的产品质量很好。苏联专家告诉我们，如果真用焦油浸麻袋来代用，可能使该工程为地下水所浸透，整个工程在建筑好以后，完全不能使用。
    （三）反对因循旧习，偷工贪快，违反施工技术规范。无论是土方工程、砖石工程、混凝土及钢筋混凝土工程、钢结构工程等，都有具体的施工技术规范可以遵循。前东北工业部出版的“一般土木建筑工程施工验收暂行技术规范”就是一本值得推崇和采用的规范。必须遵照这些规范施工，才能确保质量。前述某工厂大部分钢筋混凝土柱子出现麻面和露钢筋的情况，就是未严格遵守规范要求所致。他们在搅拌混凝土时，任意加水，搅拌出来的混凝土，很久也不灌到柱子里去，以致砂石沉淀，灰浆不匀，浇灌混凝土时，没有分段浇灌，使用振荡器捣实，这些贪工求快的结果，就造成了严重的质量事故。
      （四）严格进行隐蔽工程及样品试验的技术监督工作。每一项隐蔽工程，需要经过检验后才能覆盖。较重要的部分要经过试验。如钢筋混凝土浇制时，必须做样块试验。要反对那种做样块试验时谨慎小心，而实际操作施工时粗枝大叶的错误做法。某工地做钢筋混凝土屋面板，因钢筋截短，受力点只能依靠没有钢筋的混凝土块边，搬上屋顶后即坍落下来。以后逐块进行检验，发现大部分都不合格，造成了数千块屋面板报废的严重事故。这完全是由于不经样品试验就大批制造，而在实际操作时又不进行严格检查所造成的。
    为了严格做好施工中的技术监督工作，负责施工技术监督的人员的责任是重大的，他们必须做到下面几点：
      一、详尽地研究设计图纸，做到事先发现问题，摸清单项工程的主要问题。不但他们自己要学习图纸，还要会同乙方施工人员共同学习图纸。
    二、熟悉施工验收技术规范，掌握各种试验方法，熟悉操作规程。不只是从书本上学习，而且要注意工地现场上的先进经验，和报章杂志上介绍的先进经验。
    三、应该具有高度的责任心，细心地进行检查和监督。
    四、应该经常深入地在现场进行技术监督。但是，这并不是说在现场指手划脚，指挥施工；而是要通过一定的手续和制度来提出意见。
