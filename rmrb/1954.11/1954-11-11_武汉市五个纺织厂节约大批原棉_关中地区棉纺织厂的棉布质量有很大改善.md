Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 10th. The state-owned Wuhan First Cotton Textile Factory, the joint state-private Hankou First Textile Company, the joint state-private Yuhua Textile Company's E Factory, the joint state-private Hankou Shenxin Textile Factory, and the joint state-private Zhenhuan Textile Company saved over 120,000 jin of raw cotton for the country in October. If this raw cotton were spun into yarn and woven into cloth, it would be enough for more than 80,000 people to each make a new set of clothes.

    These five textile factories launched a labor competition in October centered on saving raw cotton and improving quality, and strengthened planned management and technical management. As a result, the amount of cotton used per piece of cotton yarn was reduced from an average of 405 jin from January to September to 395.15 jin. The quality of cotton yarn in each factory has improved compared to before, and the rate of second-grade cloth has also decreased compared to before.
    Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 10th. The quality of cotton cloth in cotton textile factories in the Guanzhong area has greatly improved.

    The state-owned Shaanxi First Cotton Textile Factory, which had failed to meet its cotton cloth quality plan for eleven months, saw its first-grade cloth rate increase by 4.5 percent in the third quarter compared to the second quarter, and by another 2.1 percent in the first half of October compared to the third quarter. Originally, only 40 percent of the workers in the weaving workshop of this factory were able to complete the quality plan, but now it has increased to more than 70 percent. This is because the weaving workshop has strengthened patrol inspections, established a quality responsibility system, and promoted technical mutual learning contracts among the workers. The first-grade cloth rate of the state-owned Northwest Second Cotton Textile Factory also increased from 91.8 percent in the second quarter to more than 95 percent in the third quarter. Due to the improvement in cotton cloth quality, this factory can accumulate about 1 billion yuan more in funds for the country annually. The Xi'an Textile Factory, which had a first-grade cloth rate of only about 84 percent before July, began to focus on key links and formulate technical measures from August, and by October 20, the first-grade cloth rate had also increased to more than 96 percent.

    武汉市五个纺织厂节约大批原棉
    关中地区棉纺织厂的棉布质量有很大改善
   【新华社武汉十日电】国营武汉第一棉纺织厂、公私合营汉口第一纺织公司、公私合营裕华纺织公司鄂厂、公私合营汉口申新纺织厂和公私合营震寰纺织公司十月份共为国家节约了十二万多斤原棉。这些原棉假如纺成纱、织成布，够八万多人各做一套新衣。
    这五个纺织工厂在十月份开展了以节约原棉、提高质量为中心的劳动竞赛，并加强了计划管理和技术管理，因而每件棉纱的用棉量从一月到九月的平均四百零五斤降低到三百九十五点一五斤。各厂棉纱的质量比以前都有提高；棉布次布率也都比以前降低了。
    【新华社西安十日电】关中地区棉纺织厂的棉布质量有很大改善。
    曾经有十一个月没有完成棉布质量计划的国营陕西第一棉纺织厂，第三季度的正布率比第二季度提高百分之四点五，十月上半月又比第三季度提高了百分之二点一。这个厂的机织车间能完成质量计划的工人原来只占百分之四十，现已增加到百分之七十多。这是因为机织车间加强巡回检查工作，建立了质量责任制，并在工人中推行技术互学合同的结果。国营西北第二棉纺织厂的正布率，也从第二季度的百分之九十一点八提高到第三季度的百分之九十五以上，这个厂因棉布质量提高全年就可以多为国家积累资金约十亿元。在七月份前正布率只有百分之八十四左右的西安纺织厂，从八月开始抓住主要环节订出技术措施，到十月二十日正布率也已提高到百分之九十六以上。
