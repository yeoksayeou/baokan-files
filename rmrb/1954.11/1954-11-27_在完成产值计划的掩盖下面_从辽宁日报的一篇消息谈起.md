    Under the Guise of Completing Production Value Plans
    ——From a News Report in the Liaoning Daily
    Our Newspaper Reporter An Gang
    On November 2nd, the Liaoning Daily published a news item with the headline "State-owned and Local State-owned Industries in the Province Overfulfill the Third Quarter Production Plan" in a prominent position on the front page. The article listed the overall situation of the fulfillment of the plan by various factories throughout the province, pointing out that the total output value of state-owned and local state-owned industries in the province reached 101%, an increase of 24.9% compared to the same period last year. By the end of September, 27 state-owned and local state-owned factories and mines had completed their annual total output value plans ahead of schedule. According to statistics from the Liaoning Provincial People's Government, state-owned and local state-owned industries completed 101% of the quarterly output value plan in the third quarter, with state-owned enterprises completing 101.7% and local state-owned enterprises completing 98.9%. Among the 46 major products of state-owned industries, 33 completed their output plans, and among the 45 major products of local state-owned industries, 26 completed their output plans. From these statistical materials, the overall completion of the total output value plan for industrial production is basically good. In the future, as long as complacency is prevented and continued efforts are made, it is possible to strive for a comprehensive completion of the annual plan in the fourth quarter. However, our newspapers should not be satisfied with merely reporting the completion of the output value plan, but should correctly analyze the actual situation of each factory's completion of its tasks, point out the current problems, and further mobilize the masses to comprehensively overfulfill the state plan. The Liaoning Daily did not do this when it published this news on November 2nd. Therefore, from this news, one cannot see the many serious situations behind the completion of the output value plan, which may encourage blind optimism in enterprises and relax people's fighting will to overcome difficulties and complete tasks.
    Why did the Liaoning Daily make a mistake of one-sidedness in publicizing the completion of the third quarter production plan?
    This is because, when reporting on the completion of the plan by enterprises throughout the province in the third quarter, they did not correctly combine the Party's policies with the overall situation in the region for publicity. This one-sidedness in publicity can be specifically stated in the following three points:
    First, the Party newspaper should adhere to the principle of comprehensively completing the state plan when dealing with the issue of completing the plan, and should not be satisfied with simply overfulfilling the total output value plan, because the total output value plan is only a part of the state plan. Premier Zhou mentioned in his "Government Work Report" at the First Session of the First National People's Congress: "For example, according to the inspection by the Ministry of Heavy Industry, the Ministry of Heavy Industry overfulfilled its overall output value plan for 1953, but 25% of its production enterprises did not complete their plans; and, if we examine it from the four indicators of total output value, cost, profit, and labor productivity, only 30% of the total number of enterprises comprehensively completed all four plans. ...These serious situations also exist in other industrial ministries, and some are even more serious. We must make great efforts to change these situations." The Liaoning Daily's publicity ignored the other aspect of the fact, which is that a considerable number of state-owned factories and local state-owned factories in Liaoning Province did not comprehensively complete the state plan from January to September this year. Although the completion of the plan in the third quarter was better, there were still problems in many aspects. For example, Anshan Iron and Steel Company overfulfilled its total output value in the third quarter, which is good. However, there are still many problems in production, mainly that many units cannot complete the production plan on a monthly or quarterly basis. Not only did the number of units that failed to complete the plan in the third quarter increase compared to the previous two quarters (13 units failed to complete the total output value task in the third quarter), but from the perspective of the 16 major products of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, only three did not complete the plan in the first quarter, only one did not complete the plan in the second quarter, but in the third quarter, seven major products, including rich ore, poor ore sintering, coke, pig iron, medium plate, and welded steel pipes, did not complete the plan. In the first quarter, 12 units did not complete the labor productivity plan, accounting for 31.6% of the total, 13 in the second quarter, accounting for 34.2%, and 14 in the third quarter, accounting for 35.9%. In terms of product quality, among the 17 major products, three did not complete the plan in the first quarter, seven in the second quarter, and eight in the third quarter. In the third quarter, among the 24 production units, only six units, including the medium-sized steel rolling mill, comprehensively completed the plan. Similar situations also exist in Fushun City: Fushun Steel Plant only completed two of the seven major steel products; as of September, the Heavy Machinery Plant only completed 20% of the 15 major products; Fushun Mining Bureau's mining and stripping did not complete the plan, resulting in an imbalance between mining and excavation, and affecting production.
    According to statistics from the Shenyang Municipal People's Government Statistics Bureau, in the third quarter, 48 of the 66 state-owned factories in Shenyang City completed the total output value plan, comprehensively completing the plan by 104.5%. On the surface, isn't the completion of the plan very good? However, if we further analyze it, it will reveal three facts: The first fact is that under this average overfulfillment of 104.5%, the fact that the light industry sector only completed 92.8% is hidden, and the average figure has become a refuge for these departments. Perhaps some will say that, no matter what, the total is always overfulfilled; but the second fact tells us: there are still 18 factories that were not included in the list of overfulfilled plans and did not complete the quarterly output value plan in the third quarter. The comprehensive completion of the plan for these 18 factories is only 77.4% of the quarterly plan that should have been completed, which means that 22.6% of the state plan was not completed. Can this be said to be a small problem? If some people still don't think so, then let's look at the third fact. The figures for the above-mentioned factories that completed the plan were obtained through comprehensive calculation. If we calculate the actual level of this quarter based on the actual working days, then the completion of the plan by these enterprises is 20.1% lower than the production in the first quarter, and 10.8% lower than the second quarter; if we look at each department separately, the factories under the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry have the largest decrease.
    One-sidedly and isolatedly publicizing the completion of the output value plan will not only cover up the shortcomings and errors in industrial production, but, even worse, it will encourage the idea of unilaterally pursuing the completion of the output value plan among some factory leaders. In order to complete the output value plan, some factories do not produce according to the types of products stipulated by the state. Regardless of whether the state needs it, they specialize in finding jobs with high output value. Therefore, on the surface, they have completed the output value plan, but no one orders these products, and they can only be stockpiled in the warehouse for a long time. Some factory leaders simply pursue the quantity of production. They take various measures to reduce product quality in order to make up enough output to complete the output value plan. Some factories, in order to rush out products, use the excuse of "trusting brother factories" and do not check whether the components cooperated by foreign factories meet the quality standards (according to the inspection, unqualified cooperative components account for more than 65%). These wrong ideas and behaviors all appear under the pretext of "completing the output value plan." The result is that it will never be possible to ensure the comprehensive completion of the state plan and harm the socialist construction work. We believe that reporting the completion of the output value plan is entirely necessary, but we cannot use isolated and one-sided methods.
    Second, the reporting work of the Party newspaper should be closely integrated with the requirements of the Party. The Liaoning Provincial Party Committee and the Party Committees of various cities are currently concentrating their efforts to take measures to ensure the comprehensive completion of the state plan. Many places are conducting in-depth inspections of the reasons for failing to complete the plan, and are intensely carrying out a labor emulation drive to comprehensively complete the plan. The newspaper's publicity should conform to this basic situation. The Liaoning Daily has a responsibility to raise some urgent practical problems from the actual situation of the completion of industrial production plans by various enterprises in Liaoning Province, and to vigorously promote the comprehensive completion of the state plan by various enterprises. For example, the plan for labor productivity. The situation of low labor productivity in many factories in Liaoning Province in the third quarter is serious. According to the materials from Shenyang City, the completion of the labor productivity plan by various factories in the third quarter declined compared to the first and second quarters. There are 28 factories that have continuously declined in the three quarters, including fan factories, screw factories, the First, Second, and Third Machine Tool Factories, the Mining Machinery Factory, the Air Compressor Factory, the High and Low Voltage Switch Factories, and the Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Seventh Rubber Factories. The continuous increase in the repair rate and the rejection rate is one of the reasons for the low labor productivity. The average repair rate of a certain factory is 40%. In September, the rejection rate of boring machine castings in the Machine Tool No. 2 Factory was as high as 46.7%. Some parts were scrapped in batches, and the design and technical departments of some factories were irresponsible, drawing a large number of erroneous drawings. In September, erroneous drawings of the High Voltage Switch Factory accounted for 21% of all drawings; after the drawings were revised, the erroneous drawings were not recovered. According to the inspection in September, the workshop was still "producing" waste products according to 3,500 erroneous drawings. Secondly, there is the relaxation of labor discipline in the factory. In a certain factory, half an hour before the end of work, a large number of workers waited at the factory gate for release. Some employees in the pharmaceutical factory read novels at work, and even slipped out to watch movies. The attendance rate of many factories did not meet the requirements of the state. Due to the relaxation of labor discipline, a large number of equipment accidents and personal accidents have been caused. In the third quarter, state-owned factories in Liaoning Province lost a total of 21,589 workdays due to equipment accidents, the most of which were in factories under the Ministry of Heavy Industry and the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry. According to statistics from January to August, a total of 87,986 work hours were lost. The work hours lost by factories under the Ministry of Heavy Industry increased by 253% compared to last year, and the work hours lost by factories under the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry increased by 237% compared to last year. The impact of two accidents in a certain factory of Anshan Iron and Steel reduced the production of more than 2,800 tons of steel plates. In the coal mine system, 40% of the accidents were caused by workers' failure to comply with operating procedures. If these situations are allowed to exist, they will all become obstacles to the comprehensive completion of the state plan.
    Even in terms of factory management, we should admit that the management work of some factories in Liaoning Province has made certain progress, but from the overall point of view, the management work lags behind the development of production, and many factories are still far behind. For example, some factories complete the plan not by tapping their own potential, but by reducing tasks. Some comrades do not understand that relying on conservative plans to live is by no means a proper way for enterprises to complete their tasks. Factories should explore potential forces from within to ensure the completion of the plan. We can find out the seriousness of the problem just by looking at the waste of production workers' labor force. According to statistics, the Oil and Fat Chemical Plant wasted 540 people's labor force in the third quarter, the First Ceramics Factory wasted 534 people's labor force, and the Medical Equipment Factory wasted 225 people's labor force. In this case, even if the payment plan is completed, the product cost will inevitably increase significantly. The most urgent thing to be solved in management work is the disconnection between supply, production, and sales. The plans of many factories are not thorough. When compiling production plans, they do not consider the needs of orders. The compilation of raw material supply plans is also disconnected from the production plans. Therefore, the operation plan cannot play a role in organizing production, and the implementation of order contracts cannot be guaranteed. As a result, a serious situation of product backlog and failure to complete order tasks is caused. In the third quarter, factories in Liaoning Province belonging to the five central industrial ministries caused 18,044 full-day shutdowns due to untimely supply of raw materials, an increase of 77.8% compared to the second quarter. In the third quarter, steel production at the Dalian Steel Plant was affected by 37 tons of steel that could not be delivered on time due to duplication, omission, and wrong specifications in the production plan. There were also 62 tons of overproduction backlog. Since the beginning of the year, there have been more than 50 times of incorrect delivery addresses and product specifications. The situation of product backlog in various factories is also very serious: the value of backlog products in state-owned industries in the third quarter reached more than 110 billion yuan, an increase of 11.7% compared to the second quarter. These losses must be added to the completed production plan, but the average figures will cover up these shortcomings in one stroke. The Party newspaper has a responsibility to expose these shortcomings to promote the relevant departments to improve their work.
    Third, we should treat every news item and every word with a serious, realistic attitude and style. All styles that exaggerate the facts are incompatible with the requirements of the Party newspaper. The Liaoning Daily's news on November 2nd put the completion of the plan by state-owned and local state-owned factories on a par, collectively calling it: "Overfulfilling the production plan." Did the local state-owned factories really complete the production plan? In fact, the completion of the production plan by local state-owned industries in the third quarter was not very good. 44% of the provincial and municipal enterprises did not complete the quarterly output value plan, and 75% of the enterprises did not complete the production, labor, cost, and financial plans. In Shenyang and Benxi cities, the plan was not completed for eight months from January to September this year. The quality of many products in local state-owned industries throughout the province is poor. In the third quarter, none of the 13 products with planned quality standards reached the planned standards. As a result of poor quality and blind production, products cannot be sold, resulting in a large backlog. According to incomplete statistics from the four cities of Fushun, Benxi, Anshan, and Lushun-Dalian, the backlog of products in these four cities at the end of September was equivalent to one-fourth of the total output value of the local industries in the four cities in the third quarter. Many enterprises have reduced production or even stopped production due to backlog. Compared with this actual situation, isn't "overfulfilling the production plan" an exaggeration?
    At present, one of the reasons for the exaggeration in the reports on factory production is said to be that some people have a unclear understanding of "what is political mobilization." They think that publicizing news for mobilization can only talk about the good side, while raising criticisms is the task of the article. In fact, the current problem is neither a question of news format nor a question of the division of labor between news and articles, but a question of one-sidedness in reporting. It is true that the news has to undertake the task of mobilization, but what are the basic requirements for the mobilization work of the Party newspaper? The most important thing is to be realistic and seek truth from facts, and to carry out mobilization based on facts. It is entirely necessary for the newspaper to commend those units that have completed the plan well in order to encourage and promote other units; but average figures cannot play the role of "advanced driving the backward," but can only encourage backward units to rely on advanced enterprises to live, can this be our requirement for mobilization? Our mobilization must not only be based on facts, but also be guided by Marxism-Leninism. News should play a leading role, not just reporting good news and not reporting bad news, encouraging blind optimism. That is to say, the facts we choose for mobilization must be checked. The editors must seriously conduct comprehensive analysis with a spirit of responsibility to the Party and correctly raise questions; only such mobilization is in line with the requirements of the Party newspaper.
    The one-sided mistake made by the Liaoning Daily in handling the publicity of completing the third quarter plan is common and widespread in many newspapers. Many newspapers have not yet clearly established the viewpoint of comprehensively completing the state plan in the publicity of industrial production. For a long time, it has mostly been a one-sided report on the completion of the output value plan. This is something that deserves our vigilance and efforts to improve. Industrial publicity is still relatively unfamiliar to us, and the complexity of industry increases the difficulty of reporting. In order to gradually solve this problem, we must seriously accept the experience and lessons from past publicity, seriously study the instructions of the Party and the government, fully embody the leading ideas and requirements of the Party committee, and pay special attention to familiarizing ourselves with the Party's economic policies, deeply understanding the economic work and the ideological situation of the economic departments, and gradually striving to achieve "having a clear idea of the situation" and improving the publicity of industrial production.

    在完成产值计划的掩盖下面
    ——从辽宁日报的一篇消息谈起
    本报记者　安岗
    十一月二日辽宁日报在第一版头条地位发表了一条标题为“全省国营和地方国营工业超额完成三季度生产计划”的新闻。文中列举了全省各工厂完成计划的综合情况，指出全省国营和地方国营工业生产总值完成百分之一百零一，比去年同时期提高百分之二十四点九。至九月末，有二十七个国营和地方国营厂矿提前完成全年生产总值计划。根据辽宁省人民政府的统计，国营和地方国营工业第三季度完成季度产值计划百分之一百零一，其中国营完成百分之一百零一点七，地方国营完成百分之九十八点九。国营工业四十六种主要产品中，有三十三种完成产量计划，地方国营四十五种主要产品有二十六种完成产量计划。从这些统计材料来看，工业生产完成总产值计划的情况，基本是好的。今后只要防止自满情绪，继续努力，在第四季度争取全面完成全年计划是可能的。但是我们的报纸，却不应满足于仅仅报道完成产值计划，而不去正确地分析各厂完成任务的实际情况，指出当前的问题，进一步动员群众全面超额完成国家计划。辽宁日报在发表十一月二日这条新闻的时候，却没有这样做，因此，从这条新闻里，看不到完成产值计划后面的许多严重情况，可能助长企业中的盲目乐观的情绪，松懈人们克服困难完成任务的战斗意志。
    辽宁日报在宣传完成第三季度生产计划的时候，为什么发生了片面性的毛病呢？
    这是因为他们在报道全省企业第三季度完成计划情况时，没有把党的政策同本区全面情况正确的结合起来进行宣传。这种宣传上的片面性，具体说来，有以下三点：
    第一，党报应当坚持以全面完成国家计划的原则来对待完成计划问题，不能只满足于超额完成生产总值计划，因为生产总值计划只是国家计划的一部分。周总理在第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上所作的“政府工作报告”中曾提到：“例如根据重工业部的检查，重工业部一九五三年总的产值计划是超额完成了，但是，它所属的生产企业却有百分之二十五没有完成计划；并且，如果从生产总值、成本、利润、劳动生产率四种指标来检查，全面完成四种计划的企业只占企业总数的百分之三十。……这些严重的情形在其他的工业部也同样存在，有的甚至更严重。我们必须用极大的努力来改变这些情形。”辽宁日报的宣传正是忽视了事实的另一方面，就是辽宁省相当多的国营工厂和地方国营工厂从今年一月至九月没有全面完成国家计划。第三季度完成计划的情况虽然较好，但在许多方面还有问题。譬如：鞍山钢铁公司在第三季度是超额完成了生产总值，这是好的。但生产上的问题还很多，主要是许多单位不能按月、按季完成生产计划。不仅在第三季度内没有完成计划的单位较前二季度是增加了（第三季度有十三个单位没有完成生产总值任务），而且从鞍山钢铁公司的十六种主要产品来看，第一季度只有三种没有完成计划，第二季度只有一种没有完成，第三季度却有富矿、贫矿烧结、焦炭、生铁、中板、焊接钢管等七种主要产品没有完成计划。劳动生产率第一季度未完成计划的单位有十二个，占总数的百分之三十一点六，第二季度十三个，占百分之三十四点二，第三季度十四个，占百分之三十五点九。产品质量，在十七种主要产品中，第一季度未完成计划的三种，第二季度七种，第三季度增为八种。第三季度内，在二十四个生产单位中，全面完成计划的，只有中型轧钢厂等六个单位。在抚顺市也有类似的情况：抚顺钢厂七种主要钢材只完成二种；重型机器厂到九月止，十五种主要产品中，只有百分之二十的产品完成计划；抚顺矿务局采剥没有完成计划，造成采掘不平衡，并影响生产。
    根据沈阳市人民政府统计局统计，第三季度，沈阳市六十六个国营工厂中，完成总产值计划的有四十八个工厂，综合完成计划百分之一百零四点五。从表面上看去，完成计划的情况不是很好吗？可是如果进一步加以分析，那就会暴露出三个事实：第一个事实，是在这平均超额完成百分之一百零四点五的数字下，隐藏了轻工业部门只完成百分之九十二点八的事实，平均数字成了这些部门的避难所。也许有人会说，不管怎样，全部总是超额了；可是第二个事实告诉我们：未列入在超额完成计划之列而在第三季没有完成季度产值计划的工厂还有十八个，这十八个工厂综合完成计划的情况仅为应完成的季度计划的百分之七十七点四，这就是说，国家计划有百分之二十二点六没有完成。这能够说是小问题吗？如果有人还不以为然，那就再看第三个事实，原来上述所举完成计划工厂的数字是综合计算得来的，如果按实际工作日数计算本季度的实际水平，那末这些企业完成计划情况比第一季度生产降低了百分之二十点一，比第二季度降低了百分之十点八；如果分别各部来看，其中又以第一机械工业部所属各厂降低的为最多。
    片面地孤立地宣传完成产值计划，不但会掩盖了工业生产的缺点和错误，而且更坏的是会助长一部分工厂领导干部片面追求完成产值计划的思想。有些工厂为了完成产值计划不按照国家规定产品种类进行生产，他们不管国家是否需要，专找产值大的活来作，因而，从表面上看，他们是完成了产值计划，但是这些产品却没有人来订货，只好长期积压在仓库里。有的工厂领导干部单纯追求生产数量，他们采取各种办法来降低产品质量，以便凑够产量来完成产值计划。也有的工厂为了赶出产品，就借口“对兄弟工厂要信任”，不去检查外厂协作的部件是否合乎质量（据检查，有的协作部件不合格的占百分之六十五以上）。这些错误的思想和行为都是在“完成产值计划”的借口下出现的，其结果就是永远也不能保证全面完成国家计划，损害了社会主义的建设工作。我们认为报道完成产值计划是完全有必要的，但不能采用孤立和片面的方法。
    第二，党报的报道工作应当紧密结合党的要求。中共辽宁省委及各市市委目前正集中力量采取措施来保证全面完成国家计划，很多地方正在深入检查完不成计划的原因，紧张地开展全面完成计划的劳动竞赛。报纸的宣传应当符合于这个基本情况。辽宁日报有责任从辽宁省各企业完成工业生产计划的实际情况中，提出一些迫切的实际问题，有力地推动各企业全面完成国家计划。比如关于劳动生产率的计划。第三季度辽宁省相当多的工厂劳动生产率低下的情况是严重的。根据沈阳市的材料，各工厂第三季度劳动生产率完成计划情况比第一和第二季度都下降，三个季度内一连下降的工厂就有扇风机，螺钉，第一、第二、第三机床厂，矿山机器厂，空气压缩机厂，高、低压开关厂，第三、四、五、七橡胶厂等二十八个工厂。返修率和废品率不断加大是劳动生产率低下的一个原因。某一工厂返修率平均为百分之四十，机床二厂九月份搪床铸件的废品率高达百分之四十六点七，有的部件成批作废，有些工厂设计技术部门不负责任，大量绘制有错误的图纸。高压开关厂九月份错误图纸占全部图纸的百分之二十一；修改图纸后，又没有把有错误的图纸收回。据九月份的检查，车间还照着三千五百张有错误的图纸在“生产”废品。其次是工厂劳动纪律的松弛。某一工厂在下班前半小时，即有大批工人在工厂门口等待放行，制药厂有的职员上班看小说，甚至溜出去看电影，很多工厂出勤率没有达到国家的要求。由于劳动纪律松弛，造成了大量的设备事故和人身事故。辽宁省国营工厂第三季度由于设备事故共停工二万一千五百八十九个工日，其中以重工业部及第一机械工业部所属各厂为最多。据一至八月份的统计，共计损失八万七千九百八十六个工时，重工业部所属各厂损失的工时比去年增加百分之二百五十三，第一机械工业部所属各厂比去年增加百分之二百三十七。鞍钢某厂两次事故的影响，减产两千八百多吨钢板。煤矿系统事故中有百分之四十是由于工人不遵守操作规程所致。这些情况如任其存在，都将成为全面完成国家计划的障碍。
    就是在工厂管理方面，我们应当承认辽宁省若干工厂管理工作是有一定进步的，但从整个来看，管理工作落在生产发展的后边，有许多工厂还落后得很远。譬如有的工厂完成计划并不是靠挖掘本身潜力，而是靠了削减任务。有些同志不了解，靠保守计划过日子绝不是企业完成任务的正当途径，工厂应当从内部发掘潜在力量来保证计划的完成。我们单看生产工人劳动力的浪费情形，就可以发现问题的严重性。据统计，油脂化学厂在第三季度内浪费了五百四十个人的劳动力，第一陶瓷厂浪费了五百三十四个人的劳动力，医疗器械厂浪费了二百二十五个人的劳动力。在这种情况下即使完成了上缴计划，实际上必然会大大提高产品成本。管理工作最迫切需要解决的是供、产、销三方面脱节问题。很多工厂的计划不周密，编制生产计划时，不考虑订货需要，编制原材料供应计划又同生产计划脱节，因而作业计划不能起组织生产的作用，对订货合同也无法保证它的实现，结果造成产品积压和不能完成订货任务的严重情况。中央五个工业部所属在辽宁省的工厂，第三季度由于原材料供应不及时，而造成全日停工的达一万八千四十四个工作日，比第二季度增加了百分之七十七点八。大连钢厂第三季度钢材生产中由于生产计划的重复、遗漏、错了规格等原因，就影响了三十七吨钢不能按时交货，还有六十二吨超产积压，从年初到现在还发错订货地址和弄错产品规格五十多次。而各厂产品积压的情形也很严重：第三季度国营工业产品积压价值达一万一千亿元以上，比第二季度增加百分之十一点七。这些损失都要加到完成的生产计划中去，但，平均的数字却会把这些缺点一笔遮过。党报有责任揭发这些缺点，来推动有关部门改进工作。
    第三，应当用严肃的实事求是的态度和作风来对待每一条新闻和每一个字，一切夸大事实的作风，都是同党报的要求不相容的。辽宁日报十一月二日这条消息把国营同地方国营工厂完成计划相提并论，笼统地称之为：“超额完成生产计划”。地方国营工厂是否真的完成了生产计划呢？事实上第三季度地方国营工业完成生产计划的情况是不十分好的。有百分之四十四的省市营企业没有完成季度产值计划，有百分之七十五的企业没有完成生产、劳动、成本财务计划。沈阳、本溪两市今年一月到九月份中有八个月没有完成计划。全省地方国营工业有很多产品质量低劣，第三季度内，十三种有计划质量标准的产品，没有一种达到计划标准。由于质量低劣和盲目生产的结果，产品推销不出去，造成大批积压。据抚顺、本溪、鞍山、旅大四个市不完全的统计，九月底这四个市积压产品约相当于四个市的地方工业的第三季度总产值的四分之一，许多企业已因积压而缩减生产甚至停产。同这种实际情况对比起来，那末“超额完成生产计划”不是夸大了吗？
    目前，对工厂生产的报道发生夸大的原因之一，据说是有人对“什么是政治鼓动”认识不清。他们以为发表新闻进行鼓动，只能谈好的一面，至于提出批评却是文章的任务。其实现在的问题既不是新闻格式问题，也不是消息同文章的分工问题，而是报道上的片面性问题。新闻要担负鼓动的任务，这是不错的，可是对于党报鼓动工作的基本要求是什么呢？最主要是实事求是，要根据事实来进行鼓动。报纸完全有必要表扬那些完成计划好的单位，来鼓舞和推动其他单位；可是平均数字却不能起“先进带动落后”的作用，而只能助长落后的单位依赖先进企业过日子，难道这能是我们鼓动的要求吗？我们的鼓动不但要以事实为基础，同时还要以马克思列宁主义为指导思想。新闻应当起领导的作用，而不是报喜不报忧，助长盲目乐观的情绪。这就是说，我们为进行鼓动而选择的事实必须是经过检查的。编辑同志必须用对党负责的精神认真地进行综合分析，正确地提出问题；只有这样的鼓动才是符合党报的要求的。
    辽宁日报在处理完成第三季度计划这个宣传问题上所犯的片面性的毛病，在很多报纸来说是共同的和普遍的，许多报纸在有关工业生产的宣传上，还没有明确地树立起全面完成国家计划的观点。长期以来，多是片面地报道完成产值计划。这是值得我们警惕并努力求得改进的。工业宣传，对于我们来说，还是比较生疏的，工业的复杂性，又增加了报道的困难。为了逐步解决这个问题，我们必须认真从过去的宣传中接受经验教训，认真学习党和政府的指示，充分体现党委的领导思想和要求，特别是要注意熟悉党的经济政策，深入地了解经济工作和经济部门的思想状况，逐渐努力达到“心中有数”，改进有关工业生产的宣传。
