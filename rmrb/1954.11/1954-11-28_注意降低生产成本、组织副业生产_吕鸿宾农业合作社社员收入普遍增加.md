    Pay Attention to Reducing Production Costs and Organizing Sideline Production
    Income of Members of Lu Hongbin Agricultural Cooperative Generally Increased
    As a result of paying attention to saving cooperative expenditures and reducing agricultural production costs this year, the actual income of the Lu Hongbin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Aiguo Village, Ju County, Shandong Province, and its members has increased significantly. This year, the cooperative's agricultural income increased by more than 69,000 jin of grain compared to last year, and the actual total income of the members increased by more than 92,000 jin of grain compared to last year. Among the 116 member households in the cooperative, the income of 79 households increased by more than 20% compared to last year, and the income of 8 households increased by more than 100%.
    Last year, in order to increase the yield of farmland, the Lu Hongbin Agricultural Production Cooperative used a large amount of commercial fertilizer regardless of cost (74 jin per mu), and also blindly carried out some basic construction that could have been postponed, borrowing more than 57 million yuan from the state. As a result, production costs accounted for 44% of agricultural income, and the cost per mu was equivalent to 177 jin of grain, so the actual income of the members did not increase much.
    This year, the cooperative learned from last year's lessons, organized members to raise pigs to accumulate fertilizer, dig pond mud, and exchange old kangs and old walls, accumulating more than 6,300 carts of natural fertilizer, and using more natural fertilizer on farmland than last year, only using 12 jin of commercial fertilizer per mu appropriately. The whole cooperative paid attention to frugality in all aspects. Herdsmen paid attention to cutting forage short, grinding feed finely, and mixing it evenly so that livestock would like to eat it and not waste forage, saving 4,500 jin of grain in feed throughout the year. A contract system was also implemented for farm tool ropes and office supplies such as paper, ink, and kerosene. These measures reduced the cooperative's expenses. Although the number of members in the cooperative doubled this year compared to last year, the amount of loans from the state was more than 32 million yuan less than last year. In addition, the Lu Hongbin Agricultural Production Cooperative also used surplus labor this year to organize sideline production such as raising pigs, raising chickens, cultivating orchards, doing carpentry, construction, and transportation according to the specialties of the members, increasing the cooperative's income by more than 20 million yuan.

    注意降低生产成本、组织副业生产
    吕鸿宾农业合作社社员收入普遍增加
    山东省莒县爱国村吕鸿宾农业生产合作社今年注意节约社的开支和降低农业生产成本的结果，全社和社员的实际收入有了显著增加。今年全社农业收入比去年增加了六万九千多斤粮食，社员实际总收入比去年增加了九万二千多斤粮食。全社一百十六户社员中，有七十九户的收入比去年增加了百分之二十以上，其中有八户增加了一倍以上。
    去年，吕鸿宾农业生产合作社为提高农田产量，不顾成本地大量施用商品肥料（每亩用七十四斤），还盲目地进行了一些可缓办的基本建设，向国家贷款五千七百多万元。结果使生产成本占了农业收入的百分之四十四，每亩成本合一百七十七斤粮食，因此社员实际收入增加不多。
    今年合作社接受了去年的教训，组织社员养猪积肥、挖塘泥、换旧炕旧墙，积自然肥料六千三百多车，农田使用自然肥料比去年增多，每亩只适当地使用了十二斤商品肥料。全社各方面都注意了节约。饲养员注意把饲草锄短、料磨细，调拌均匀，使牲口爱吃，不剩草料，全年就节约了四千五百斤粮食的饲料。农具绳索和纸张、墨水、灯油等办公用品方面，也实行了包干制。这些措施减少了社的开支，虽然今年社员比去年扩大了一倍，但是向国家贷款却比去年少三千二百多万元。此外，吕鸿宾农业生产合作社今年还利用剩余劳动力，按照社员的专长组织了养猪、养鸡、栽培果园，做木工、建筑和运输等副业生产使全社收入增加了两千多万元。　（新华社）
