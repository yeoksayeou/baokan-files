Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 7th: Shandong Province's 113 million mu of autumn grain crops have been harvested. Preliminary statistics show that the total autumn grain output of the province has increased by 3,243 million jin compared to last year, with the yield per unit area increasing by 18.9%. Currently, the vast number of farmers are seizing the time to dry the grain and preparing to sell large quantities of surplus grain to the state.

In Shandong Province, 68.1% of the total number of farm households have joined mutual aid and cooperative organizations. On this year's agricultural production front, the province's more than 24,000 agricultural production cooperatives actively led the vast number of farmers to explore production increase potential according to local conditions and strive to improve the yield per unit area. The 14,620,000 mu of soybeans and 7,840,000 mu of millet in the Liaocheng, Heze, Dezhou, and Huimin regions on both sides of the Yellow River were mostly sown with superior varieties such as "Swan Egg" and "Flat Top Yellow" soybeans and "Huanong No. 4" millet. This year, the yield of these superior varieties was about 15% higher than that of general varieties. According to a survey of nine counties, including Jiaoxian, Rizhao, Zhucheng, and Jimo, the promotion of superior varieties alone increased grain production by approximately 180 million jin. Farmers in the Jiaodong and Yimeng mountainous areas also planned to expand the area of high-yield crops such as corn and sweet potatoes by more than 2.3 million mu this year. The mutual aid and cooperative organizations in these areas also led farmers to turn and plow the land, improving cultivation techniques. The corn grown by agricultural production cooperatives in the Wendeng and Laiyang regions yielded an average of about 300 jin per mu, and the sweet potatoes planted after soil improvement generally yielded more than 3,000 jin per mu. In the low-lying areas of southwestern Shandong, the farmers who had been organized dug ditches and ridges, and created terraced fields, resulting in an unprecedented bumper harvest of crops this year.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengde, 7th: Farmers in Rehe Province have increased their grain harvest by 32,200 tons through careful harvesting, equivalent to increasing the province's harvest by half a year.

At the beginning of this year's autumn harvest, Rehe Province conducted education among farmers on careful harvesting through people's congresses at all levels. The chairman of the Rehe Provincial People's Government, the director of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry, and others led more than 500 cadres to go deep into the countryside to promote the importance of careful harvesting to the farmers. All state-owned farms took the lead in demonstrating. After being educated, the farmers actively launched activities. Farmers in Chengde County put forward the slogan of supporting the liberation of Taiwan, supporting industrial construction, and supporting disaster areas through careful harvesting, and the county harvested an additional 1.2 million jin of grain. Farmers in Chifeng County changed the old habit of "no one staying on the field, livestock eating their fill," and threshed and stored the grain in a timely manner, increasing the county's harvest by more than 880,000 jin. Women and children played a significant role in the autumn harvest. In Damiao Village, Pingquan County, a 77-year-old woman, Granny Mu, picked up a斗 (dǒu) of grain in seven days.

After the farmers in various places carefully harvested more grain, they actively paid agricultural taxes and sold surplus grain. The Hongqi Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jianping County has sold 32,000 jin of grain to the state.

    山东全省增产三十二亿多斤秋粮
    热河省农民细收细打增加了半成年景
    【新华社济南七日电】山东省一亿一千三百万亩秋季粮食作物已收获完毕。据初步统计：全省秋粮的总产量比去年增产三十二亿四千三百万斤，单位面积产量提高百分之十八点九。现在，广大农民正抓紧晒粮，准备大量向国家出售余粮。
    山东省已有占总农户百分之六十八点一的农户参加了互助合作组织。在今年的农业生产战线上，全省的两万四千多个农业生产合作社，曾积极带动广大农民因地制宜地发掘增产潜力，努力提高单位面积产量。黄河两岸的聊城、菏泽、德州、惠民等专区的一千四百六十二万亩大豆和七百八十四万亩谷子，大部分是选用“天鹅蛋”、“平顶黄”大豆和“华农四号”谷等优良品种播种的。今年这些优良品种的产量，都比一般品种高出百分之十五左右。据胶县、日照、诸城、即墨等九个县的调查，仅推广优良品种一项，约计增产粮食一亿八千万斤。胶东和沂蒙山区的农民，今年还有计划地扩大了玉米、地瓜等高产作物二百三十多万亩。这些地区的互助合作组织还带动农民翻地刨地，提高耕作技术。文登和莱阳两专区农业生产合作社的玉米，平均每亩收成三百斤左右，经过改良土壤后种的地瓜，一般每亩都收获三千斤以上。鲁西南低洼地区，经过组织起来的农民挖沟洫、造畦田，使今年的农作物也得到空前的丰收。
    【新华社承德七日电】热河省农民在秋收中细收细打，多收粮食三万二千二百吨，相当于全省增加了半成年景。
    今年秋收一开始，热河省各地便通过各级人民代表大会向农民进行细收细打的教育，热河省人民政府主席、农林厅长等又相继率领五百多名干部深入农村向农民宣传细收细打的重要性，各国营农场都带头示范。农民们经过教育后，积极展开活动。承德县农民提出以细打细收的行动来支援解放台湾、支援工业建设、支援灾区的口号，全县共多收粮食一百二十万斤。赤峰县农民改变了过去“场上不留人，牲口吃饱场”的老习惯，及时打，快入库，全县多收粮食八十八万多斤。妇女儿童在秋收中起了很大作用，平泉县大庙村七十七岁的穆大娘，在七天中拣了一斗粮食。
    各地农民细收细打多收粮食后，都积极缴纳农业税和出售余粮。建平县红旗农业生产合作社已卖给国家粮食三万二千斤。
