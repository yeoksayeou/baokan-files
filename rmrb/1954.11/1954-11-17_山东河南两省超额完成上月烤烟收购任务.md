Shandong and Henan Provinces, major flue-cured tobacco production areas, both exceeded their flue-cured tobacco purchase quotas for October. Shandong Province completed 110% of its monthly plan, accounting for 34.42% of the fourth quarter plan; Henan Province completed 119.15% of its monthly plan, accounting for 50% of the quarterly plan.

In October, the Shandong and Henan provincial tobacco monopoly companies seized the season of large-scale new tobacco sales, relied on supply and marketing cooperatives, and vigorously carried out purchase work; at the same time, they respectively organized work teams to go deep into major producing areas to provide specific assistance and guidance to the purchase work. In Henan Province, the amount of purchases entrusted to cooperatives by the monopoly company this year accounted for 83% of the company's total purchases. In order to facilitate tobacco farmers' sales, many major tobacco collection points in Shandong Province increased manpower and scales, and, under the instruction of local governments, organized food and beverage services and set up medical aid teams. As a result, tobacco farmers' enthusiasm for selling tobacco was even higher. In mid-October, the highest daily purchase volume of flue-cured tobacco in Shandong Province was approximately 100,000 jin higher than the highest purchase volume in the same period last year.

    山东河南两省超额完成上月烤烟收购任务
    烤烟的主要产区的山东、河南两省，十月份都超额完成了烤烟收购任务。山东省完成月计划百分之一百一十，占第四季度计划的百分之三十四点四二；河南省完成月计划百分之一百一十九点一五，占季度计划的百分之五十。
    十月份，山东、河南两省的专卖事业公司抓紧新烟大量上市的季节，依靠供销合作社，大力展开收购工作；同时，分别组织工作组，深入各主要产地，对收购工作进行了具体的帮助和指导。河南省专卖公司今年委托合作社收购的数量，占该公司全部收购量的百分之八十三。为了便利烟农售烟，山东省不少主要收烟点增加了人力和磅秤，并根据当地政府的指示组织了水食饭业，设置了医疗救护组。烟农售烟情绪因此更加高涨。山东省十月中旬每天烤烟的最高收购量，比去年同期最高收购量约多十万斤。
