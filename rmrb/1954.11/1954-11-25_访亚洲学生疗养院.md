    A Visit to the Asian Students' Sanatorium
    Bai Sheng
    About twenty kilometers northwest from Fuxingmen in Beijing, one arrives at the southern foot of the famous scenic spot of Beijing – the Western Hills. Here, the scenery is beautiful, and the air is fresh. At the foot of the mountain, a magnificent palace-style building has been erected. This is the Asian Students' Sanatorium of the International Student Union.

    The Asian Students' Sanatorium is the second large-scale sanatorium established by the International Student Union, capable of accommodating three hundred tuberculosis patients. It covers an area of 90,000 square meters, with a building area of more than 20,000 square meters. The main buildings of the sanatorium include three ward buildings, a medical building, and an office building.

    The wards in the ward buildings here all face south, with plenty of sunlight. Stepping inside, one feels very comfortable. Each floor has sixteen wards, each accommodating one or two patients. The light blue or apple green walls of the rooms are complemented by brand-new and exquisite furnishings. The wire beds are covered with clean white quilts and soft floral blankets; there is a flower stand at the head of the bed, as well as a small cabinet containing the patient's daily necessities and headphones for listening to the radio. Exiting the ward through the south door, there is a spacious balcony. Patients can sunbathe here, take walks, breathe fresh air, or enjoy the scenery of the mountains and fields.

    In each ward building, there are two spacious and bright solariums where patients can lie on rattan chairs to rest and sunbathe. Each floor has an extremely elegant dining room. Patients sitting in the dining rooms on the second or third floor can enjoy various dishes brought up by elevator from the first floor. The dining rooms are equipped with modern insulation and disinfection equipment. In addition, each floor is equipped with a soiled linen chute, allowing patients to directly send soiled linen to the laundry for disinfection and washing.

    The sanatorium has very complete and state-of-the-art medical and health facilities. The medical building houses sterile operating rooms, septic operating rooms, and regular operating rooms; there are also X-ray rooms, physiotherapy rooms (including electrotherapy, phototherapy, kinesiotherapy, etc.), ENT departments, laboratories, and pharmacies.

    To make the lives of patients in the sanatorium more enjoyable, the medical building also houses a recreation room. Patients can play chess, cards, billiards, violin, and watch movies here. There is also a library with various world-renowned literary works, newspapers, and magazines. A kinesiotherapy room is also set up, with exercise equipment such as rocking beds and dumbbells. Various flowers, trees, and a fountain are being planted and built in the garden.

    The establishment of the sanatorium came about as follows: At the Second World Student Congress held in Prague, Czechoslovakia in 1950, the Chinese student delegation proposed building an Asian Students' Sanatorium in China to promote the welfare and health of Asian students. This proposal was warmly welcomed and supported by all the delegates present, especially those from Asian countries. Students from various countries also actively expressed their support. The International Student Union and the International Student Relief Fund allocated funds to purchase medical equipment for the sanatorium. The All-China Students' Federation provided full support for the construction of the sanatorium.

    Chinese young students participated in various construction tasks with great enthusiasm. Students from the Department of Architecture of Tsinghua University and Qingdao Institute of Technology participated in the design and construction of the sanatorium. Hundreds of students from Peking University, Renmin University of China, Beijing Institute of Geology, Beijing Agricultural University, and Beijing Normal University participated in the beautification of the gardens. Teachers and students from the Central Academy of Fine Arts enthusiastically created artistic arrangements for the sanatorium, painting huge oil paintings and sculptures.

    The sanatorium also received help from young students in other countries. Youth organizations such as the Soviet Youth Anti-Fascist Committee, the Czechoslovak Youth League, and the Free German Youth League donated a large number of medical equipment, such as valuable large-scale surgical instruments, tomographic cameras, shadowless lamps, ultra-shortwave electrosurgical knives, universal surgical beds, autoclaves, X-ray machines, oxygen emergency devices, and metabolism testers. British students raised funds for the sanatorium, Icelandic students prepared to donate a large amount of cod liver oil to the sanatorium, and Indian students collected many books and newspapers. The All-Japan Federation of Student Self-Government Associations sent a telegram to the All-China Students' Federation, expressing their warm concern for the Asian Students' Sanatorium.

    The Asian Students' Sanatorium is a sanatorium for tuberculosis, admitting students from universities in Asian countries who suffer from mild pulmonary tuberculosis for treatment and recuperation, waiving medical, food, and accommodation fees. Patients can submit applications for admission directly to the International Student Union or the Asian Students' Sanatorium through their national student organizations or student relief groups. The travel expenses for patients coming to the sanatorium are borne by the patients or the relevant student organizations or student relief groups in their own countries, and if there are difficulties, they can apply for subsidies from the International Student Union. Currently, the sanatorium has begun to admit patients (the first phase will admit about one hundred people).

    The establishment of the Asian Students' Sanatorium signifies the International Student Union's care for Asian students. At the same time, it symbolizes the unity and friendship between Chinese young students and Asian young students, and it also symbolizes the solidarity of international students. (Attached pictures)

    访亚洲学生疗养院
    柏生
    出北京复兴门西北行约二十公里，便到北京著名的风景区——西山的南麓。这里，风景优美，空气清新。山脚下已矗立起一座金碧辉煌的宫殿式的大楼。这便是国际学生联合会亚洲学生疗养院。
    亚洲学生疗养院是国际学生联合会举办的第二所大规模的疗养院，可容纳三百个结核病人。它占地面积达九万平方公尺，建筑面积为二万多平方公尺。全院主要建筑包括三幢病房大楼、一幢医疗大楼、一幢办公楼。
    这里病房大楼的病房全是向南的，阳光非常充足，一走到里面，令人感到非常舒适。每层楼里设有十六间病房，每间可住一个或两个病人。房内淡蓝色或苹果绿色的墙壁，衬托着崭新精致的摆设。钢丝床上，铺着洁白的被子和柔软的花毯；床头有一个花架，还有一个小柜，里面放有病人的日用品，以及收听广播用的耳机子。出病房的南门，便是一条宽敞的阳台。病人可以在这里进行日光浴，散步，呼吸新鲜空气，或欣赏山野景色。
    在每幢病房大楼里，都建筑有两间宽敞明亮的日光室，病人可以躺在藤椅上休息，进行日光浴。在每层楼里都设有十分雅致的餐厅。病人坐在二楼或三楼的餐厅里，便可以吃到由一楼用电梯送来的各种饭菜。餐厅中都有现代化的保温和消毒设备。此外，每层楼上都装置有污衣箱，病人可以把污衣放进去直接送到洗衣房里消毒洗涤。
    院内有着非常完善和最新式的医疗卫生设备。在医疗大楼里设有无菌手术室、有菌手术室和普通手术室；还有爱克斯光室、理疗室（包括电疗、光疗、体疗等）、眼耳鼻喉科室、化验室和药房等。
    为了使疗养的病人在疗养期间生活得更加愉快，在医疗大楼里，还设立了文娱室。病人可以在这里下棋、打扑克、打克郎球、拉提琴和看电影。还有一个图书室，里面藏有各种世界文学名著和报纸、杂志等。又布置了一个体疗室，里边有摇床、哑铃等运动器械。庭园里，正在种植各种花草树木和修建喷水池。
    疗养院建立的经过是这样的：在一九五○年在捷克斯洛伐克布拉格召开的第二届世界学生代表大会上，中国学生代表团提议，在中国筹建亚洲学生疗养院，以促进亚洲学生的生活福利和健康。这个提议受到了全体到会代表特别是亚洲各国代表的热烈欢迎和支持。各国学生也积极表示支持。国际学生联合会和国际学生救济会并拨款为疗养院购置医疗器材。中华全国学生联合会给疗养院的建筑以全力的支持。
    中国青年学生以最大的热情参加了各种建院工作。清华大学建筑系和青岛工学院的同学们，曾参加了疗养院的设计和施工工作。北京大学、中国人民大学、北京地质学院、北京农业大学、北京师范大学等校的数百名学生，都参加了美化庭园的工作。中央美术学院的师生们，热情地为疗养院作艺术布置，绘制了巨幅的油画和雕塑。
    疗养院还得到其他国家青年学生的帮助。苏联青年反法西斯委员会、捷克斯洛伐克青年联盟、自由德国青年联盟等青年组织，赠送了大批医疗器材，如珍贵的大型手术器械、断层摄影机、无影灯、超短波电开刀、万能手术床、高压灭菌器、爱克斯光机、氧气救急器、新陈代谢检查器等。英国学生为疗养院进行了募捐，冰岛学生准备捐助大量鱼肝油给疗养院，印度学生则募集了许多书报。全日本学生自治会总联合会打电报给中华全国学生联合会，对亚洲学生疗养院表示了热情的关怀。
    亚洲学生疗养院是一所结核性的疗养院，它接收亚洲国家各大学患轻度肺结核病的学生入院疗养，免收医疗、食宿等费用。病人经过本国学生组织或学生救济团体的介绍，可直接向国际学生联合会或亚洲学生疗养院提出申请书，申请入院。病人来院时的旅费，由病人或本国有关的学生组织或学生救济团体承担，如有困难时，可以向国际学生联合会申请补助。目前，疗养院已开始接收病人（第一期约接收一百人）。
    亚洲学生疗养院的建立，表示着国际学生联合会对亚洲学生的关怀，同时，它象征着中国青年学生和亚洲青年学生的团结和友谊，也象征着国际学生的团结一致。（附图片）
