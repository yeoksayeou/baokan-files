The Zhengzhou Railway Special Court along the line recently held a sentencing conference, and made careful and serious judgments on Zhao Shuxin and Feng Xuezhu, who were responsible for major traffic accidents caused by violating labor discipline and railway regulations.

Zhao Shuxin, the construction负责人 (fùzé rén - person in charge) of the Fifth Line Engineering Team of Zhengzhou Railway, violated traffic safety regulations and neglected his duties when building the Chenjiahe meeting station on the Beijing-Hankou Railway. He failed to correct the phenomenon of randomly placing pieces of stone and ballast on both sides of the track, which obstructed traffic. Instead, he piled sleepers in places that hindered traffic, resulting in a major accident in which a freight train derailed and overturned, causing eight freight cars to be severely damaged, one slightly damaged, eighteen rails and three hundred and sixty-four sleepers crushed, and a loss of more than 500 million yuan in state property. The deputy conductor was seriously injured, four freight handlers were slightly injured, and traffic was interrupted for fifteen hours.

On September 27th, Feng Xuezhu, a pointsman at the Shanxian Station, violated railway technical management regulations and failed to inspect the close contact status of the turnout after traffic passed. After a malfunction occurred in the turnout, Feng Xuezhu still did not inspect it, and together with the chief pointsman and shunter, forcibly pulled down the signal by hand, causing a passenger train to enter the turnout that had not been properly turned, resulting in a major derailment accident. One passenger car was severely damaged and one was moderately damaged, and line materials were also damaged, resulting in a loss of more than 70 million yuan in state property.

The Zhengzhou Railway Special Procuratorate along the line and the Luoyang Transportation Branch of the Zhengzhou Railway Administration filed public prosecutions and charges for these two major traffic accidents. The Zhengzhou Railway Special Court along the line conducted trials, and Zhao Shuxin and Feng Xuezhu confessed their responsibility for the accidents. In order to rectify labor discipline, protect public property, and implement railway regulations, the Zhengzhou Railway Special Court along the line, in accordance with national laws, sentenced Zhao Shuxin to two years of imprisonment and Feng Xuezhu to six months of imprisonment.

The employees of the Zhengzhou Railway Administration supported this judgment and are discussing these two major traffic accidents in order to learn from them, strengthen labor discipline, eliminate serious traffic accidents, and ensure the completion of national transportation tasks.
