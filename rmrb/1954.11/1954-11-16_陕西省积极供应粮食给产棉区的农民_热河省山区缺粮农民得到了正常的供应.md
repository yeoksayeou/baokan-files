    Shaanxi Province is vigorously supplying grain to farmers in cotton-producing areas. Since the new cotton crop came on the market in early September, counties in Shaanxi's cotton-producing areas, such as Sanyuan, Jingyang, and Gaoling, have been paying attention to strengthening this work. In addition to adjusting and transporting the quantity and variety of grain supplies according to local needs, these counties have also promptly established more supply points and vigorously launched grain supply work. After Gaoling County added supply points in Chengguan and Beiguo, it supplied more than 1.93 million jin of various grains to cotton-growing farmers from September 1 to October 25. Before the new cotton came on the market, Xianyang County transferred more than 77,000 jin of various grains to the first and second districts, where more cotton is produced. From the time the new cotton came on the market to the end of September, the first district alone supplied grain to 6,896 households, of which cotton farmers accounted for more than 87%. Due to the normal grain supply, the amount of cotton coming onto the market has continued to increase in recent days.

Xinhua News Agency:
    The state's implementation of the unified purchase and sale of grain has guaranteed the supply of food grain to farmers in the mountainous areas of Rehe Province.
    Half of the population of Rehe Province lives in mountainous areas. The mountainous areas mainly produce pears, fruits, and cotton, and food grain needs to be supplied. In the past, this became a loophole for grain merchants to speculate and make profits. They often defrauded grain in the grain-producing areas of the mountains at an exchange rate of one package of needles for four jin of grain, and then sold it at high prices in the grain-deficient areas. The implementation of the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain has changed this situation. The state, through supply and marketing cooperatives, has carried out planned supplies to grain-deficient farmers. The state transferred more than 10,000 tons of grain to Qinglong County, a grain-deficient area. Farmers in Shangfangzi District of Jianchang County, which is rich in pears and fruits, bought food grain from the supply and marketing cooperatives. The unified sale of grain also takes into account the dietary habits of farmers. In Xinglong County in the mountainous area, the state transferred corn and shipped in sorghum according to the farmers' habits. Over the past year, the grain supply in the mountainous areas has been normal and the price of grain has been stable. Grain-deficient farmers believe that having a grain purchase certificate is equivalent to having grain, and they have concentrated the money they used to save grain in the past and invested it in production.

    陕西省积极供应粮食给产棉区的农民
    热河省山区缺粮农民得到了正常的供应
    陕西省大力供应产棉区农民粮食。自九月初新棉上市以后，陕西省产棉区的三原、泾阳、高陵等县就注意加强这一工作；这些县除根据当地实际需要，对粮食供应的数量和品种进行了调剂和调运外，还及时增设了供应据点，大力展开粮食供应工作。高陵县在城关和北郭增设了供应据点后，自九月一日到十月二十五日已供应植棉农民各种粮食一百九十三万多斤。咸阳县在新棉上市前，就给这个县产棉较多的第一、二两区增调各种粮食七万七千多斤，仅第一区从新棉上市到九月底，就有六千八百九十六户人家得到了粮食供应，其中棉农就占供应户的百分之八十七强。由于粮食供应正常，近日来，各地棉花上市量继续增多。　　　　　　（新华社）

    国家实行粮食统购统销保障了对热河省山区农民的食粮供应。
    热河省有半数人口住在山区。山区主要生产梨果、棉花，食粮需要供应。过去，这就成为粮商投机牟利的空子，他们经常在山中粮产区以一包针换四斤粮的比价骗取粮食，运到缺粮区后用高价出售。粮食统购统销政策的实施改变了这种情况，国家经过供销合作社对缺粮农民进行了计划供应。国家向缺粮区青龙县调进了一万多吨粮食。盛产梨果的建昌县和尚房子区的农民们从供销合作社买到了食粮。粮食统销还照顾到农民的食用习惯。在山区兴隆县，国家根据农民习惯，调出玉米运进了高粱。一年来，山区粮食供应正常，粮价稳定。缺粮农民认为有了购粮证就等于有了粮食，把往年存粮用的钱都集中起来投入了生产。　　　（新华社）
