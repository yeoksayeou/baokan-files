    The "Young Pioneers Palace" of the Beijing Normal University Affiliated High School was established on the 8th.

    The "Young Pioneers Palace" has an exhibition room and an activity room. The "Heroes Corner" in the exhibition room displays portraits of the Soviet hero Matrosov drawn by the Young Pioneers and essays written after reading the book "Ordinary Soldier". The exhibition room displays the outstanding academic work of the Young Pioneers. There is a small evergreen pine tree, which was presented by all the members of the Communist Youth League of the Beijing Normal University Affiliated High School. They hope that the Young Pioneers will be as cold-resistant and evergreen as the pine tree, not be afraid of difficulties, and study hard. In addition, there is a set of woodworking tools donated by the school's teachers' union and specimens of corn and sunflower seeds planted by the junior high school third-grade Young Pioneers. What attracts attention in the exhibition room is a map of Taiwan collectively made by the Young Pioneers, as well as a "Aurora" cruiser and two silver-gray jet airplanes. The exhibits in the exhibition room will be changed regularly, and the members will continuously build the "Young Pioneers Palace" with various excellent works.

    The activity room is a place for the members' recreational activities, and it contains various recreational activity supplies. The Red Scarf Chorus and Drum and Bugle Corps of the "Young Pioneers Palace" have been organized, and aviation model groups, weather groups, etc. will also be established. In the future, film evenings, field trips, small football matches and other activities will also be organized.

    “少先宫”设有展览室和游艺室。展览室的“英雄角”陈列有少年先锋队员们画的苏联英雄马特洛索夫的像和阅读“普通一兵”一书的读后感。展览室展出了少年先锋队员们优秀的学习作业成绩。有一棵四季常青的小松树，是北京师范大学附属中学全体青年团员赠送的，他（她）们希望少年先锋队员们像松树那样耐寒而常青，不怕困难，努力学习。此外，还陈列有学校教师工会赠送的一套木工工具和初中三年级少年先锋队员种的玉蜀黍、葵花籽的标本。展览室中引人注目的是少年先锋队员们集体制作的一幅台湾地形图和一艘“阿芙乐尔”号巡洋舰、两架银灰色喷气式飞机。展览室的展览品将不定期地更换，队员们将不断地以各种优秀作品建设“少先宫”。
    游艺室是队员们文娱活动的场所，里面有各种文娱活动用品。“少先宫”的红领巾合唱团和鼓号队已经组织起来了，航空模型小组、气象小组等也将成立。以后还将组织电影晚会、郊外旅行、小足球赛等活动。（新华社）
