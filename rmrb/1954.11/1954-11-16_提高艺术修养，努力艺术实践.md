The East China Holds a Festival of Opera Performances

The East China Opera Performance Festival was held in Shanghai from September 25th to November 6th. The performances included 158 programs from 35 opera genres, including Peking Opera, Shanghai Opera, Min Opera, Wu Opera, Yue Opera, Huangmei Opera, Jianghuai Opera, Changxi Opera, Shandong Bangzi, Lü Opera, Kunqu Opera, Hui Opera, Yong Opera, Yang Opera, Puppet Show, Shadow Puppet Show, and Leather Shadow Play. Among them were large-scale classical traditional operas, as well as folk minor operas mainly based on song and dance; there were programs depicting ancient Chinese historical stories and folk legends, as well as programs depicting the struggles and lives of modern people.

During the performances, the conference conducted research and discussions on the performing programs, and also held a "Opera Literature Exhibition". The conference notated the main tunes of various local operas, and recorded all the performances. The better scripts from the performances have been published in "Play Selections". During the performances, the conference also successively held symposiums for playwrights, directors, actors, opera music, and stage art to discuss opera reform work in various places.

The conference finally announced the list of winners in seven aspects: script, performance, actor, director, music, stage art, and special art performance, and issued certificates and medals.

Collecting Folk Songs in the Hetao Area of Inner Mongolia

Teachers and students of the Composition Department of the Central Conservatory of Music went to the Hetao area of Inner Mongolia, on the north bank of the Yellow River and the southern foot of the Ula Mountain, to collect folk songs during their internship. They have recently completed the arrangement and compilation. They collected a total of 400 tunes and nearly 1,000 lyrics, including the most widely circulated "Climbing Tune," "Mongolian-Han Tune," local operas, and folk ditties in the Hetao area.

These folk songs are not only beautiful in melody and lyrics, but also have a strong sense of the people and artistry. In the past, the local people were oppressed by the Kuomintang reactionaries and feudal landlords, and their class hatred was very deep. Many folk songs reflected the people's hatred for the reactionary ruling class and their infinite yearning for a bright and happy life. One folk song sang: "A southeast wind blows gently, no longer a farmhand for the landlord." It reflects the people's curse on the landlords and their own wishes. After liberation, the people of Inner Mongolia began a new life, and the people's love and praise for the new life are also fully reflected in the folk songs. They sang: "Green mountains and clear waters, ravines one after another, good days are ahead." "The water in the Chegou is too shallow to sail a boat, mutual aid and cooperation can move mountains." Among the newly collected folk songs, there are also many that praise the steadfastness of love between young men and women and oppose the constraints of feudal marriage.

The Central Conservatory of Music's trip to the Hetao area of Inner Mongolia to collect folk songs was not only to experience life and prepare for composition lessons, but also made a considerable contribution to the sorting out and promotion of the motherland's folk music.

Capital Performances of Dramas Such as "Ten Thousand Waters and a Thousand Mountains"

Three military art troupes under the Cultural Department of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army performed three dramas in the capital, "The Southern Shift of the Frontline", "Ten Thousand Waters and a Thousand Mountains" and "The Forefront of the East China Sea," which reflect the heroic struggles of our army. "The Southern Shift of the Frontline" has ended its performance, and "Ten Thousand Waters and a Thousand Mountains" and "The Forefront of the East China Sea" will be performed successively starting from the 7th.

"The Southern Shift of the Frontline", performed by the Art Troupe of the Political Department of the North China Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, mainly depicts the heroic deeds of the Chinese People's Volunteers in launching attacks on the American imperialist aggressor troops and the Li Seung-man bandit army in Korea, changing the entire frontline situation. The playwright, Hu Ke, also described the struggle between advanced, scientific military thinking and conservative, backward military thinking in the play.

The Art Troupe of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army will perform the six-act, eight-scene drama "Ten Thousand Waters and a Thousand Mountains" starting on the 7th. This drama depicts the historical traces of the 25,000-mile Long March of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. "The Forefront of the East China Sea" will be performed by the Art Troupe of the Political Department of the East China Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The content reflects our country's coastal defense forces, firmly guarding the east coast of the motherland, annihilating the invading Chiang bandit army, and expressing our army's anger at the American imperialist aggression against Taiwan and the determination to liberate Taiwan.

Classical Music Touring Performance

The Chinese Folk Classical Music Touring Performance Troupe, organized by the Chinese Musicians Association, recently gave its first performance in Shenyang. This is the first performance of the troupe's tour of major cities across the country. The performance is divided into two parts: folk singing and classical instrument performance.

The folk singing includes female choruses by the Folk Chorus of the Central Song and Dance Troupe. They sang beautiful Shaanxi folk songs such as "Duì Huā" ("Facing the Flower"), "Sānshí Lǐ Pù" ("Thirty Li Shop"), "Xìntiān Yóu" ("Believe in Heaven"), "Shāo Shǒupà" ("Bring a Handkerchief"), "Lán Huā Huā" ("Blue Flower"), and "Fūqī Dòu Qù" ("Husband and Wife Teasing"). Their singing is healthy and simple. The folk singing also includes Shandong Qinshu performed by Zou Huansheng and Han Fenglan, familiar to audiences in Liaoning Province: "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai Go Down the Mountain."

Classical instrument performances include: Qin, Xiao, and Erhu ensemble by Guan Pinghu, Zha Fuxi, and Jiang Fengzhi. The tune they played together, "Píng Shā Luò Yàn" ("Wild Geese Descending on the Sandbank"), is a famous ancient tune loved by Qin players for 300 years, depicting the scene of endless sand and wild geese flying and singing. Others include: Feng Zicun's flute solo Suiyuan folk music "Xǐ Xiàngféng" ("Happy Reunion") and "Fàng Fēngzhēng" ("Flying a Kite"); Jiang Fengzhi's Erhu solo "Hàn Gōng Qiū Yuè" ("Autumn Moon over the Han Palace") and "Kōng Shān Niǎo Yǔ" ("Birds Singing in the Empty Mountain"); Li Tingsong's Pipa solo "Shí Miàn Mái Fú" ("Ambush from Ten Sides"); Guan Pinghu's Guqin solo "Guǎnglíng Sǎn", an ancient tune composed by Ji Kang of the Jin Dynasty; Zhao Chunting's Suona solo "Shandong Dagu" and Hebei folk music "Xiǎo Fàng Niú" ("Little Cowherd").

Music workers in Liaoning Province and Shenyang City feel that this performance is of great significance in promoting learning from classical and folk music.

Documentary of Mei Lanfang's Stage Art to be Filmed

A color film documenting the stage art of Mei Lanfang, China's famous dramatist, will begin filming in early December.

This film is divided into two parts, including Mei Lanfang's life and six Peking Opera programs: "Kàng Jīn Bīng" ("Resisting the Jin Troops"), "Bàwáng Bié Jī" ("Farewell My Concubine"), "Yǔzhòu Fēng" ("Cosmic Front"), "Guìfēi Zuì Jiǔ" ("The Drunken Concubine"), "Luò Shén" ("Goddess of the Luo River"), and "Jīnshān Sì, Duàn Qiáo" ("Jinshan Temple, Broken Bridge").

With the assistance of units such as the Beijing Film Studio, the Chinese Academy of Traditional Opera, and the Central Academy of Fine Arts, the film has completed its test shooting work, and Soviet cinematographers and sound engineers have been invited to participate in the filming work.

    提高艺术修养，努力艺术实践
    华东举行戏曲观摩演出大会
    华东区戏曲观摩演出大会，从九月二十五日起到十一月六日在上海举行。参加演出的有京剧、沪剧、闽剧、婺剧、越剧、黄梅戏、江淮戏、常锡剧、山东梆子、吕戏、昆曲、徽剧、甬剧、扬剧、布袋戏、傀儡戏、皮影戏等三十五个剧种的一百五十八个剧目。其中有大型的古典传统剧目，也有以歌舞为主的民间小戏；有表现我国古代历史故事和民间传说题材的，也有表现现代人民斗争和生活的剧目。
    在演出期间，大会曾对演出剧目作了研究、讨论，还举行了“戏曲文献展览会”。大会对各种地方戏的主要曲调进行了记谱，全部演出作了录音。演出中较好的剧本已出版了“剧本选集”。演出期间，大会还陆续召开了编剧、导演、演员、戏曲音乐和舞台美术等座谈会，讨论各地的戏曲改革工作。
    大会最后宣布了剧本、演出、演员、导演、音乐、舞台美术、特种艺术表演七个方面的获奖名单，颁发了奖状和奖章。
    到内蒙河套地区采集民歌
    中央音乐学院作曲系师生，实习期间到黄河北岸、乌拉山南麓的内蒙河套地区采集民歌，已在最近编排整理完毕。他们采集的有包括河套一带流传最广的“爬山调”、“蒙汉调”、地方戏曲和民歌小调共四百支曲调和近千首歌词。
    这些来自民间的歌曲，不仅曲调、歌词优美，而且具有强烈的人民性和艺术性。当地人民过去受国民党反动派和封建地主的压榨，阶级仇恨很深，民歌里很多都反映了人民对反动统治阶级的痛恨，对光明幸福生活的无限向往。有一首民歌唱道：“丝喽喽刮了一场东南风，再不给地主当长工。”反映了人民对地主的诅咒和自己的愿望。解放后内蒙人民开始了新生活，人民对新生活的热爱和赞颂，也充分地在民歌里反映出来。他们这样唱道：“青山绿水一道道沟，好活的日子在后头。”“车沟里水流撑不开船，互助合作推倒个山。”新搜集的民歌里，还有很多是赞颂男女青年爱情的坚贞和反对封建婚姻束缚的。
    中央音乐学院作曲系这次去内蒙河套地区搜集民歌，不仅是体验生活，为创作课做了准备，而且对于整理、发扬祖国的民间音乐也有相当的贡献。
    首都公演“万水千山”等话剧
    中国人民解放军总政治部文化部主办的三个部队文艺工作团在首都公演“战线南移”、“万水千山”和“东海最前线”等三个反映我军英勇斗争事迹的话剧，“战线南移”已结束演出，七日起陆续公演“万水千山”和“东海最前线”。
    中国人民解放军华北军区政治部文艺工作团演出的“战线南移”，主要表现中国人民志愿军在朝鲜英勇地向美帝国主义侵略军和李承晚匪军发起攻击，改变了整个战线形势的英雄事迹。剧作者胡可在剧中并描写了先进的、科学的军事思想和保守的、落后的军事思想的斗争。
    中国人民解放军总政治部文艺工作团七日起公演六幕八场话剧“万水千山”，这个剧描写了中国工农红军二万五千里长征的史迹。“东海最前线”将由中国人民解放军华东军区政治部文艺工作团演出，内容是反映我国海防部队，坚强地守卫祖国东海岸，歼灭来犯的蒋贼军，表现出我军对美帝国主义侵略台湾罪行的愤恨和解放台湾的决心。
    古典音乐巡回演出
    中国音乐家协会组织的中国民间古典音乐巡回演出团，最近在沈阳作了第一次演出。这是该团在全国各大城市巡回演出的首次演出。演出共分两部分：民间演唱和古典乐器演奏。
    民间演唱有中央歌舞团民间合唱队的女声合唱。她们共演唱了“对花”、“三十里铺”、“信天游”
  “捎手帕”、“蓝花花”、“夫妻逗趣”等优美的陕北民歌。她们的演唱健康而朴素。民间演唱还有为辽宁省观众所熟悉的邹环生、韩凤兰演唱的山东琴书：“梁山伯与祝英台下山”。
    古典乐器演奏有：管平湖、查阜西、蒋风之的琴、箫、二胡合奏。他们合奏的曲子“平沙落雁”是三百年来为古琴家们所喜爱的著名古曲，表现的是平沙无垠，秋雁飞鸣的情景。其他还有：冯子存的笛子独奏绥远民间音乐“喜相逢”和“放风筝”；蒋风之的二胡独奏“汉宫秋月”和“空山鸟语”；李廷松的琵琶独奏“十面埋伏”；管平湖的古琴独奏晋代稽康所作的古曲“广陵散”；赵春亭的唢呐独奏“山东大鼓”和河北民间音乐“小放牛”。
    辽宁省和沈阳市的音乐工作者都感到这次演出对推动向古典和民间音乐学习有很大作用。
    梅兰芳舞台艺术纪录片将摄制
