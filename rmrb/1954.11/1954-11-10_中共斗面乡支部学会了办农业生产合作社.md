The Communist Party of China's Doumian Township Branch Has Learned How to Run Agricultural Production Cooperatives
    Zeng Yuqiu
    The Doumian Township Branch of the Communist Party of China is one of the best branches in the twelfth district of Fu'an County, Fujian Province. The work foundation here is relatively good. Last winter, when grain was purchased and marketed in a unified way, general task education was carried out among the masses. The masses were very enthusiastic about participating in mutual aid and cooperation, and the organized farmers accounted for 90 percent of the total number of farmers. After propaganda and education since spring and summer, 34 of the 38 mutual aid groups in the township have requested to establish agricultural production cooperatives.

    Before autumn, the district committee changed the method of sending work teams to run cooperatives and began to let the branch independently take charge of running cooperatives. Now the branch has established two agricultural production cooperatives, and four more cooperatives are in the process of assessing property. 264 farmers have joined agricultural production cooperatives, accounting for 60 percent of the total number of farmers. Judging from the current situation, the work of establishing cooperatives is proceeding relatively smoothly, with fewer deviations, and the leading backbone has maintained the advantage of poor and lower-middle peasants.

    How does the Doumian Township Branch of the Communist Party of China run cooperatives?

    First, Clarify the Thinking of Party Members

    In the past, the party members of this branch did not have a clear understanding of the party's basic tasks in rural areas. Everyone only knew to organize farmers and develop production, but they could not see the future of mutual aid and cooperation. This spring, after branch secretary Guo Deci went to the Party School to study, he understood that socialist transformation should be carried out in agriculture, and party members should lead the masses to take the socialist road. Only by taking the socialist road can everyone become rich and support national construction. After Guo Deci came back, he combined the actual situation of the township and educated party members to take the road of collectivization. He also used concrete facts to show that if the spontaneous tendency of farmers is not restricted, they will embark on the capitalist road. After discussion, the party organization clearly realized that the center of work must be shifted to mutual aid and cooperation. Party members reviewed the leadership of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Branch Secretary Guo Deci reviewed that in the past, due to unclear understanding of mutual aid and cooperation, he did not lead this work well. Party members also expressed that they must lead the mutual aid groups well and create conditions for the development of agricultural production cooperatives.

    The branch also regularly organizes party members to conduct political study. After studying the article "Overcoming Capitalist Tendencies within the Party," party members all checked their own thoughts in connection with reality. Branch Secretary Guo Deci said: "Party members are the guides of farmers. It is wrong to only want to get rich personally without leading farmers to take the socialist road. I didn't want to sell surplus grain before the unified purchase and sale last year, and now I understand that this is not right." Branch Deputy Secretary Xie Shengkang said: "I transferred back last year and wanted to kill pigs for business, so I was reluctant to sell the surplus grain to the state. This kind of thinking must be eliminated." Party member Lin Wenxiao once hired a worker under the guise of hiring a cowherd. The branch strictly criticized Lin Wenxiao's erroneous thinking and behavior, pointing out that it is wrong for party members to take the lead in hiring workers. If party members do this, the masses will also do this. After criticism and education, Lin Wenxiao dismissed the worker. All party members have raised their socialist consciousness.

    Before autumn, when the district committee decided to let the branch run cooperatives, the party members' thinking became confused again. Branch Deputy Secretary Xie Shengkang said: "This is a major socialist event, why doesn't the higher authority send someone?" Zheng Cheng'an said: "Our mutual aid group has a foundation, but without a work team to guide us, we are afraid that there will be difficulties in running cooperatives!" Many people felt that the responsibility was great and feared that they would not be able to run it well. The branch then led everyone to discuss this ideological situation. Everyone recalled that every time the party assigned a new task, they felt that they had no experience and didn't know how to do it, but everyone was determined to do a good job, and the task was completed. Therefore, they all realized: "Nothing is difficult in the world for those who put their heart into it." Everyone also analyzed the current favorable conditions for running cooperatives: the foundation of mutual aid and cooperation is good, the enthusiasm of the masses is high, party members and the backbone of running cooperatives have all studied in the mutual aid and cooperation training class run by the district committee, and they can also ask the district committee for instructions if something happens. Branch Secretary Guo Deci said: "Everything is learned, no one is born knowing it. As long as we earnestly learn policies and rely on the masses, the work will be done well." Everyone agreed with his view.

    Give Play to Collective Strength

    After the party's internal thinking was unified, it was determined that Branch Secretary Guo Deci would be responsible for the overall work of establishing cooperatives, and he would go deep into the key group, Xie A'xi Mutual Aid Group, to create experience and guide the overall situation. Township Head Zheng Baimei, who is responsible for leading the township's excess production campaign, took care of the cooperative transformation work of Zheng Cheng'an's group; and six other party members were assigned to five mutual aid groups preparing for cooperative transformation.

    In order to lead the work of establishing cooperatives well, the branch paid attention to giving play to collective strength, holding party meetings every seven days to study the problems in establishing cooperatives. In the entire process of running cooperatives, the branch held a total of seven branch committee meetings and six party member meetings. Each meeting focused on solving an important problem. At the branch committee meeting on August 15, everyone discussed the principles, policies, and steps for establishing cooperatives and formulated a township-wide plan for establishing cooperatives. The branch committee meeting on August 29 studied how to overcome the "self-reliance" thinking in running cooperatives in a joint group.

    Regularly Study the Party's Policies

    In the process of running cooperatives, the branch paid attention to leading everyone to study the party's policies. In addition to sending main cadres and mutual aid group leaders to participate in the mutual aid and cooperation training class run by the district committee to study the principles and policies of running cooperatives; it also led everyone to study the methods of running cooperatives. After repeated study and discussion, everyone had a certain understanding of the principles and policies of establishing cooperatives, especially the principles of "active leadership, steady progress" and "only allow good management, not bad management." Guo Deci said: "To lead farmers to take the socialist road, we must actively lead, and we cannot stand still. It is like building a house, just talking about it and not moving your hands, you can never build it. To run a cooperative well, farmers must consciously and voluntarily take this road, and absolutely no coercive orders can be used." The branch also used examples to make everyone remember the party's policies.

    The branch often organizes everyone to study the advanced experience of running cooperatives in various places. At the beginning of establishing cooperatives, the branch organized a total of 36 people, including party members, cadres, and mutual aid group leaders from the township, to go to Louxia Basic Point Township to study Shi Linxian's experience in establishing cooperatives. When transitioning to property assessment, the experience of property assessment of the Shi Linxian Mutual Aid Group was discussed again, and it was understood that a property assessment committee should be established first, and standard fields should be selected. In this way, the property assessment work proceeded relatively smoothly.

    If there are any problems that are not understood, the branch will promptly ask for instructions from higher authorities. For example, when the Xie A'xi Mutual Aid Group was discussing the deduction of public accumulation funds, they did not know where to deduct it from. Branch Secretary Guo Deci personally ran to Louxia Township to ask the work team.

    Conduct In-Depth Persuasive Education for the Masses

    Branch Secretary Guo Deci personally took action and specifically led the Xie A'xi group to run cooperatives. His method was: first let the mutual aid group leader Xie A'xi deeply publicize the purpose and method of running cooperatives to the group members. After the publicity, it was found that there were seven households that really wanted to run cooperatives, six households that wanted to run cooperatives but had concerns, and four households that had very heavy ideological concerns. At this time, Guo Deci found two group members with representative views for individual conversations. One household was poor peasant Guo Kangxian, who believed that he could rely on government loans after joining the cooperative. Guo Deci explained to him that the purpose of running cooperatives is to take the road to common prosperity, and it is necessary to rely on everyone's cooperation, actively labor, and develop production. It is wrong to simply rely on government loans. He also publicized the future of agricultural production cooperatives to him, so that he corrected his attitude towards joining the cooperative. Another household was Chen Lan'an, whose land and labor were average. He had the idea of "following the wind." Guo Deci specifically explained the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives to him, and inspired his enthusiasm for joining the cooperative.

    After the branch found out the thoughts of the group members, it led everyone to start a discussion, summarize the advantages of the mutual aid group, and at the same time pointed out the problems in the mutual aid group, so that the group members realized that these problems could be solved after the land was managed in a unified way and the labor force was used in a unified way. The branch also used examples from other places and local examples to explain the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives to the group members, and repeatedly explained the policies, so that the group members voluntarily signed up to join the cooperative. After each step of the work of establishing the Xie A'xi Mutual Aid Group, the branch immediately held meetings of party members and Youth League members to summarize experience and promote it throughout the township. At the same time, the branch also extracted backbones and activists from key groups to help the newly built cooperatives solve problems. The branch once sent Xie A'xi to Guo Xidi's group to help solve the concerns of group members who had more land and less labor. The branch paid attention to inspecting the work of key groups, listening to the opinions of the masses on them, and constantly improving the work of key groups.

    Mobilize Everyone to Run Cooperatives Together

    In the process of running cooperatives, the branch attached great importance to uniting and using the strength of all parties and activists. After each branch committee meeting was held and the party made a resolution, it immediately held an expanded cadre meeting. First, it explained the branch's intentions to the cadres and activists, let everyone put forward amendments and supplements, and let them bring the branch's propositions to the masses with full political enthusiasm. At the same time, the branch also put forward different requirements for all parties. For example, at the beginning of property assessment, the branch required Youth League members in the cooperative group to actively assist in the property assessment, and Youth League members in non-cooperative groups to publicize to the masses, do a good job in production, and welcome the establishment of cooperatives; required township government cadres to do a good job in the mutual aid groups in their villages and handle the daily work in the township; required women cadres to solve the ideological problems of women in property assessment and actively develop sideline production to support agriculture; required militiamen to protect the work of establishing cooperatives well and be vigilant against bad elements spreading rumors and carrying out sabotage activities.

    In the mutual aid groups preparing for cooperative transformation, the branch paid attention to using the strength of activists and specifically explained the methods in the work. Xie Ruitang, a Youth League member of the Xie A'xi group, had poor working ability and few methods in the past. When Branch Secretary Guo Deci assigned him work, he studied with him and specifically taught him how to do it, which improved his confidence. Xie Ruitang gradually found ways to do things in his work.

    Because the branch is good at organizing and using the strength of all parties, the township-wide excess production campaign and the collectivization movement can be carried out vigorously and effectively.

    中共斗面乡支部学会了办农业生产合作社
    曾毓秋
    中共斗面乡支部是福建省福安县十二区最好的支部之一。这里的工作基础较好，去冬实行粮食统购统销时，曾对群众进行了总任务教育，群众参加互助合作的积极性很高，组织起来的农户占总农户的百分之九十。经过春夏以来的宣传教育，全乡三十八个互助组，就有三十四个要求办农业生产合作社。
    秋前，区委改变了派工作组办社的办法，开始让支部独立负责去办社。现在支部已经办成了两个农业生产合作社，还有四个社正在进行评产工作，参加农业生产合作社的农户有二百六十四户，占总农户的百分之六十。就现在的情况看，建社的工作进行得比较顺利，偏差较少，领导骨干中保持了贫雇农的优势。
    中共斗面乡支部是怎样办社的呢？
    先把党员的思想弄通
    这个支部的党员过去对党在农村中的基本任务的了解是不够明确的。大家只知道把农民组织起来，发展生产，却看不清互助合作的发展前途。今年春天，支部书记郭德慈去党校学习后，才明白了要对农业实行社会主义改造，党员就要领导群众走社会主义的道路。也只有走社会主义道路，大家才能富裕，才能支援国家建设。郭德慈回来后，联系本乡实际情况，教育党员走合作化的道路，又通过具体事实，说明如果对农民的自发倾向不加以限制，就会走上资本主义道路。经过讨论，党组织明确认识了必须把工作中心转移到互助合作方面来。党员们检查了对互助合作运动的领导情况。支部书记郭德慈检讨了过去由于对互助合作认识不明确，以致没有很好地去领导这一工作。党员也都表示一定要领导好互助组，为发展农业生产合作社创造条件。
    支部还经常组织党员进行政治学习。在学习了“克服党内的资本主义倾向”一文后，党员们都联系检查了自己思想。支部书记郭德慈说：“党员是农民的引路人，不领导农民走社会主义道路，只想个人发财是错误的。我在去年统购统销前，就不想卖余粮，现在懂得这是不对的。”支部副书记谢胜康说：“我去年转业回来，想杀猪作买卖，就不肯爽利地把余粮卖给国家。这种思想一定要去掉。”党员林文孝曾以雇看牛小孩为名，雇了一个雇工。支部对林文孝的这种错误思想和行为，进行了严格批判，指出：党员带头雇工是错误的，党员这样做，群众也会这样做。经过批评教育，林文孝就辞退了雇工。全体党员都提高了社会主义觉悟。
    秋前，区委决定让支部办社时，党员的思想又混乱起来。支部副书记谢胜康说：“这是社会主义大事，为什么上级不派人来？”郑成安说：“我们互助组是有基础，可是没工作组来指引，办社怕有困难！”好多人感到责任很大，怕办不好。支部便针对这一思想情况，领导大家讨论。大家回忆党每次交下新任务时，都感到没经验，不会办，可是大家决心好好干，任务也就完成了；因此，都认识到：“天下无难事，只怕有心人。”大家又分析了目前办社的有利条件：互助合作基础好，群众热情高，党员和办社骨干都在区委办的互助合作训练班里学习过，有事还可以请示区委。支部书记郭德慈说：“什么都是学来的，都不是生来就会的。只要我们认真学政策，依靠群众，工作就会做好。”大家都同意他的看法。
    发挥集体力量
    党内思想统一后，确定支部书记郭德慈负责建社的全面工作，并深入到重点组谢阿细互助组去创造经验，指导全盘。负责领导全乡超额增产运动的乡长郑白妹，照顾郑成安组的转社工作；还有六个党员分工到五个准备转社的互助组中去。
    支部为了领导好建社工作，注意发挥集体力量，每七天召开一次党的会议，研究建社中的问题。在整个办社过程中，支部共开了七次支委会，六次党员大会，每次会议都集中解决一个重要问题。在八月十五日的支委会上，大家讨论了建社的方针、政策、步骤，制定了全乡建社计划。八月二十九日的支委会，研究了如何克服联组办社中的“自立门户”的思想。
    经常学习党的政策
    在办社过程中，支部注意领导大家学习党的政策。支部除了派主要干部和互助组长参加区委办的互助合作训练班，学习办社的方针、政策外；又领导大家学习办社的办法。经过反复的学习讨论，大家对于建社的方针、政策，特别是对“积极领导，稳步前进”和“只许办好，不许办坏”的方针有了一定的体会。郭德慈说：“要领导农民走社会主义的路，一定要积极领导，不能站着不走。好比修房子，光是嘴讲，双手不动，再也修不成。要想办好社也还要农民自觉自愿地走这条路，绝对不能采用强迫命令。”支部又用实例，使大家牢记着党的政策。
    支部经常组织大家学习各地办社的先进经验。建社之初，支部组织了全乡党员、干部、互助组长等共三十六人到楼下基点乡学习施霖现建社经验。在转入评产时，又一次讨论了施霖现互助组评产的经验，懂得要先建立评产委员会，选择标准田站队。这样，评产工作就进行得比较顺利。
    遇有不懂的问题，支部就及时请示上级。例如谢阿细互助组在讨论公积金的扣除问题时，不知从那里扣除好。支部书记郭德慈便亲自跑到楼下乡去问工作组。
    对群众进行深入的说服教育
    支部书记郭德慈亲自动手，具体领导谢阿细组办社。他的作法是：先让互助组长谢阿细向组员深入宣传了办社的目的和方法。经过宣传后，发现真正要求办社的有七户，想办社又有顾虑的有六户，思想顾虑还很重的有四户。这时郭德慈就找了两户有代表性的组员个别谈话。一户是贫农郭康现，他是认为入社后可以依靠政府贷款。郭德慈就对他说明，办社是为了走大家富裕的路，要靠大家合作，积极劳动，发展生产。单纯依靠政府贷款是不对的。又向他宣传了农业生产合作社的前途，使他端正了入社的态度。另一户是陈蓝安，他的土地一般，劳力一般，他存在着“随风倒”的思想。郭德慈就跟他具体说明了农业生产合作社的优越性，启发他入社的热情。
    支部摸清了组员的思想，就领导大家展开讨论，总结互助组的好处，同时指出了互助组里的问题，使组员认识到在土地统一经营、劳力统一使用之后，就能解决这些问题。支部又运用外地、本地的实例向组员说明农业生产合作社的优越性，并反复地讲解政策，使组员们都自觉自愿地报名入社了。谢阿细互助组建社的每一步工作结束后，支部立即召开党员、团员会议，总结经验，向全乡推广。同时，支部还从重点组抽出骨干、积极分子帮助新建社解决问题。支部就曾派谢阿细到郭细弟组去帮助解决土地多、劳力弱的组员的顾虑。支部注意对重点组的工作进行检查，听取群众对他们的意见，不断改进重点组的工作。
    动员大家一起来办社
    支部在办社过程中，十分重视团结、运用各方面和积极分子的力量，每次支委会开过，党内作出决议后，紧接着就开扩大干部会议，先向干部、积极分子说明支部意图，让大家提出修正和补充意见，让他们以饱满的政治热情，把支部主张带到群众中去。支部同时还对各方面分别提出不同要求。比如在开始评产时，支部要求办社组的团员要积极协助评产，非办社组的团员则要向群众宣传，搞好生产，迎接办社；要求乡政府干部，搞好自己所在村的互助组，处理好乡里的日常工作；要求妇女干部解决妇女在评产中的思想问题，并积极开展副业生产，支援农业；要求民兵很好地保卫建社工作，警惕坏分子造谣和进行破坏活动。
    在准备转社的互助组中，支部注意运用积极分子的力量，在工作中具体交代办法。谢阿细组团员谢瑞堂，过去工作能力差，办法少。支部书记郭德慈给他布置工作时，同他一起研究，具体地教给他做法，提高了他的信心。谢瑞堂在工作中慢慢就有了办法。
    由于支部善于组织和运用各方面的力量，所以全乡超额增产运动和合作化运动能够开展得蓬勃有力。
