Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 19th—Jiangsu Province has newly established 12,000 agricultural production cooperatives this autumn, and more than 8,000 new cooperatives are under construction. After all these cooperatives are completed, plus the original 4,400 old cooperatives, the province will have approximately 25,000 agricultural production cooperatives. Currently, in areas such as Huaiyin and Yancheng, more than 80% of the townships have cooperatives, and many cooperative villages have emerged.

　　These agricultural production cooperatives were all established in batches before autumn on the basis of year-round preparation. This spring and summer, members of the County Party Committees and District Committees of the Chinese Communist Party, who are responsible for leading the mutual aid and cooperation movement, directly led one cooperative to create experience in running a cooperative, while also creating conditions for developing new cooperatives. The agricultural production cooperatives established in the spring often absorbed mutual aid teams who wanted to join the cooperative in attending cooperative meetings, or organized them to visit the cooperatives. This autumn, the fact that more than 4,000 cooperatives overcame unprecedented flooding and achieved generally good harvests had a profound educational impact on mutual aid teams and individual farmers, and more people requested to establish cooperatives. Some mutual aid teams around old cooperatives called themselves "production teams outside the cooperative." In Songjiang County, there were 600 mutual aid teams with more than 10,000 farmers around 71 old cooperatives who requested to establish cooperatives. To this end, various counties universally held mutual aid and cooperation cadre training classes in the autumn, training more than 66,000 backbone members for running cooperatives. Counties, districts, and townships also held mutual aid and cooperation representative meetings to summarize production achievements, introduce the experiences of old cooperatives, and study the establishment of cooperatives with representatives of farmers who applied to establish cooperatives. Therefore, the newly established cooperatives generally have a good foundation. Currently, the focus of work in various regions has been placed on consolidating the new cooperatives, and continuing to train cadres and cultivate the next batch of targets for establishing cooperatives.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 19th—Hebei Province has begun a comprehensive rectification of the newly established agricultural production cooperatives. This work is being carried out in conjunction with the unified purchase and sale work.

　　While carrying out the unified purchase and sale work, each county has used a certain number of county and district cadres to assist the general Party branches of various townships in rectifying and consolidating the new cooperatives. Currently, various regions are classifying the newly established cooperatives and solving the problems existing within the cooperatives accordingly. In order to run the large-scale cooperatives that have emerged in this year's agricultural cooperation movement, many regions have held meetings of large-scale cooperative directors or representatives of large-scale cooperatives to exchange experiences in running large-scale cooperatives. Many regions have also rectified the mutual aid and cooperation networks (stations). According to statistics from seventeen counties including Anping and Yuanshi, 324 new mutual aid and cooperation networks (stations) have been established.

　　This year, Hebei Province has newly established 58,097 agricultural production cooperatives, which, together with the 28,977 old cooperatives that have been expanded and merged, have reached 87,074, with a total of 2,300,490 households, accounting for 29.86% of the province's total number of farm households. According to statistics from seven special districts and three cities, more than 17,900 new cooperatives are being planned.

    江苏省秋季建成一万二千个农业合作社
    河北省结合统购统销整顿新建农业合作社
    【新华社南京十九日电】江苏全省已在秋季中新建成农业生产合作社一万两千个，还有八千多个新社正在建立中。这批合作社全部建成以后，加上原有的四千四百多个老社，全省将有约二万五千个农业生产合作社。现在，淮阴、盐城等地区已有百分之八十以上的乡有了合作社，并出现了许多合作化的乡村。
    这些农业生产合作社都是在常年准备的基础上，秋前分批建立的。今年春、夏，各县分工领导互助合作运动的中共县委委员和区委员会都直接领导一个合作社创造办社经验，同时，并创造发展新社的条件。春季建立起来的农业生产合作社经常吸收要求办社的互助组参加合作社的会议，或组织他们到合作社参观。今年秋季四千多个社战胜百年未有的洪水灾害，收获普遍较好的事实，对互助组和单干农民有极其深刻的教育，要求建社的更多。有些老社周围的互助组自称为“社外生产队”。松江县七十一个老社周围就有六百个互助组一万多农民要求办社。为此，各县在秋季又普遍举办互助合作干部训练班，培养了六万六千多个办社骨干分子。各县、区、乡还分别开了互助合作代表会议，总结生产成绩，介绍老社经验，和申请办社的农民代表研究建社问题。因而新建各社一般基础较好。现在，各地工作重点已放在巩固新社方面，并在继续训练干部和培养下一批建社的对象。
    【新华社保定十九日电】河北省对新建的农业生产合作社开始全面进行整顿工作。这一工作是结合统购统销工作进行的。
    在进行统购统销工作的同时，各县都以一定数量的县、区干部协助各乡的中共总支部进行整顿巩固新社工作。现在各地正对新建社进行分类排队，针对社内存在的问题分别加以解决。为办好今年农业合作化运动中出现的大型社，不少地区召开了大社社长或大社的代表会议，交流了办大社的经验。很多地区还整顿了互助合作网（站）。据安平、元氏等十七个县统计，新建互助合作网（站）三百二十四个。
    今年河北省新建立农业生产合作社五万八千零九十七个，连同经过扩建、合并的二万八千九百七十七个旧社，已达八万七千零七十四个，共有二百三十万零四千九百多户，占全省总农户的百分之二十九点八六。另据七个专区和三个市的统计，正在酝酿建立的新社有一万七千九百多个。
