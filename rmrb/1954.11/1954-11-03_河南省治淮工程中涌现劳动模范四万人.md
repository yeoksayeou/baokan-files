    Following this year's extraordinary flood in the Huai River basin, the Henan Provincial Huai River General Headquarters held the First Henan Provincial Labor Model Representatives Conference for Harnessing the Huai River from October 20th to 27th, rewarding labor models who emerged in the Huai River project and individuals who demonstrated active performance in this year's flood control efforts.

    Over the past four years, 3.2 million people in Henan Province have participated in the Huai River project, with 40,000 labor models emerging from the project. The 229 labor model representatives attending this conference are representatives of these 40,000 model individuals. Among them are Zhu Deming, a worker with outstanding contributions to his work; Ma Fuqian, a migrant worker who has participated in the Huai River project four times and has been awarded the title of model each time; Wang Guangcheng, a military worker who made great achievements at the Bo Mountain Reservoir construction site; Qian Xingsun, a young technical cadre who made outstanding innovations in the Nanwan Reservoir project shortly after graduating from school; and Hu Manzi, a farmer who showed heroic and active performance in this year's flood prevention and rescue efforts, and others. Because they led the masses to engage in selfless labor, four valley reservoirs—Shi Mantan, Banqiao, Baisha, and Bo Mountain—were built in just four years, and four depression storage projects—Laowangpo, Wu Songhu, Jiaotinghu, and Tonghu—were repaired, and more than 50 rivers were harnessed to varying degrees. As a result, a large amount of floodwater was intercepted and stored in this year's extraordinary flood, which played a significant role in flood control. In Henan Province alone, the disaster situation was reduced for seven million mu of farmland. These models are deeply loved by millions of people on both sides of the Huai River.

    The models attending the conference expressed one after another that they would continue to work hard in the future Huai River project, continue to carry forward revolutionary heroism, and strive to thoroughly harness the Huai River. (Xinhua News Agency)

    河南省治淮工程中涌现劳动模范四万人
    河南省治淮总指挥部在淮河流域度过了今年特大洪水之后，于十月二十日到二十七日举行了河南省第一届治淮劳动模范代表大会，奖励治淮工程中涌现的劳动模范及在今年防汛斗争中表现积极的人物。
    四年多以来，河南省有三百二十万人先后参加了治淮工程，工程中涌现的劳动模范达四万人。出席这次会议的二百二十九位劳动模范就是这四万模范人物的代表。其中，有在工作中有卓越贡献的工人朱德明、四次参加治淮工程都获得模范称号的民工马福乾、在薄山水库工地创造巨大功绩的军工王广成、从学校出来不久在南湾水库工程中作了突出创造的青年技术干部钱杏荪，还有在今年防汛抢险中表现英勇积极的农民胡蛮子等等。由于他们带动群众进行了忘我的劳动，在短短的四年中建成石漫滩、板桥、白沙、薄山四个山谷水库，修好老王坡、吴宋湖、蛟停湖、潼湖四个洼地蓄洪工程，并且对五十多条河道进行了不同程度的整理，因而在今年特大洪水中，拦蓄了大量洪水，对防洪起了显著作用。仅河南省境内，便有七百万亩农田减免了灾情。这些模范们受到淮河两岸千百万人民深挚的爱戴。
    出席大会的模范们在会上纷纷表示，将在今后治淮工程中再接再厉，继续发扬革命英雄主义，为彻底治好淮河而奋斗。　（新华社）
