    Beijing, November 11 (Xinhua News Agency) — Seventeen united traditional Chinese medicine clinics in Beijing have signed medical contracts with seventy-one agricultural production cooperatives, including Huangtugang Township, Baipenyao Township, "May First," and "Spark." The united traditional Chinese medicine clinics that signed contracts with agricultural production cooperatives have mostly reduced outpatient and home visit fees. Some united clinics are also carrying out preventive healthcare work and emergency medical treatment within the agricultural production cooperatives.
    In order to ensure that members do not delay production when seeking medical treatment, the Dongbajanjian United Clinic has established a branch clinic near the "May First" agricultural production cooperative. The Yuegezhuang United Clinic has also formed two mobile medical teams to provide medical treatment to members near the various agricultural production cooperatives. The Xihongmen and Liulitun United Clinics also stipulate that members can see a doctor whenever they arrive, without being restricted by outpatient hours.

    北京市十七个中医联合诊所
    同七十多个农业生产合作社订立医疗合同
    北京市十七个中医联合诊所同黄土岗乡、白盆窑乡、“五一”、“星火”等七十一个农业生产合作社订立了医疗合同。同农业生产合作社签订合同的中医联合诊所，大都减低了门诊和出诊费用。有些联合诊所并在农业生产合作社内开展预防保健工作和急救医疗。
    联合诊所为了使社员看病不耽误生产，东八间房联合诊所已在“五一”农业生产合作社附近设立了分诊所；岳各庄联合诊所也组成了两个巡回医疗组到各农业生产合作社附近去给社员看病；西红门、六里屯联合诊所还规定社员随到随看，不受门诊时间的限制。（新华社）
