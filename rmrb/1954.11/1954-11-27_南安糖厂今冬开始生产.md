    Nan'an Sugar Factory to Begin Production This Winter

    The basic construction of the Nan'an Sugar Factory in Fujian Province is nearing completion and will begin production this winter. The sugar factory has already ordered a large quantity of sugarcane from farmers in nearby villages. Before the sugar factory even ordered sugarcane from the farmers, the nearby farmers had already prepared to sell sugarcane to the sugar factory. They said: "Supporting industrial production is our glorious responsibility." Before ordering sugarcane, the sugar factory convened a meeting of sugarcane production area group leaders and sugarcane farmer representatives, announced the sugarcane ordering price, formally signed sugarcane ordering contracts, and prepaid a portion of the deposit. The sugarcane farmers were generally satisfied with the sugarcane price and the contract. After the meeting, the farmer representatives visited the sugar factory's basic construction project. They were particularly interested in the various types of machinery in the factory.

    南安糖厂今冬开始生产
    福建省南安糖厂基本建设工程即将完工，并将在今冬开始生产。糖厂已向附近各乡农民订购了大批甘蔗。在糖厂还没有向农民订购甘蔗前，附近农民早已准备把甘蔗卖给糖厂。他们说：“支援工业生产是我们的光荣责任。”在订购甘蔗前，糖厂召开了甘蔗产区交蔗组长和蔗农代表会，宣布了甘蔗订购价格，正式签订了订购甘蔗合同，并预付了部分订金。蔗农对蔗价和合同普遍感到满意。会后，农民代表参观了糖厂基本建设工程。他们对工厂里各式各样的机械特别感到兴趣。
