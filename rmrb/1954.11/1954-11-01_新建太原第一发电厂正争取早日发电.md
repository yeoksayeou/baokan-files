    The broad masses of workers at the steam turbine construction site of the newly built Taiyuan No. 1 Power Plant are working intensely to install the steam turbine, striving for early partial power generation.
    The steam turbine installation project is the most complex and meticulous of all the equipment installation projects at the newly built Taiyuan No. 1 Power Plant; it is the heart of the entire power plant. Since the installation project began on September 10th, the workers have launched a labor competition, aiming to complete seventy days' worth of work in fifty days. In over a month, the workers have overcome many difficulties and achieved great results. For example, the surface plate, an indispensable tool for installing steam turbines, requires extremely high precision, but through everyone's research, it was finally manufactured. In grinding the rotor shaft journal, according to the suggestions of Soviet experts, a set of simple cast iron tools was modified, which doubled the efficiency and completed the very precise grinding task ahead of schedule. The cleaning task of No. 2 machine was also completed four days ahead of schedule. The grinding task of the steam turbine shims was also completed two days ahead of schedule, saving fifty man-days. At present, the broad masses of workers are continuing the installation.

    新建太原第一发电厂正争取早日发电
    新建太原第一发电厂汽机工地的广大职工，正在紧张地安装汽轮机，争取早日局部发电。
    汽轮机的安装工程，是新建太原第一发电厂各种设备安装中，最复杂、细致的一项工程，它是整个发电厂的心脏。从九月十日安装工程开始后，工人们展开了劳动竞赛，要争取在五十天内完成七十天的任务。在一个多月的时间里，工人们已克服了许多困难，取得很大成绩。如平尺，是安装汽机中不可缺少的一种工具，它的精密程度极严，但是经过大家钻研，终于制成了。研磨转子轴项，根据苏联专家建议，改了一套简单的铸铁工具，使效率提高两倍，提前完成了很精密的研磨任务。二号机的清理清洗任务，也提前四天完成。汽机垫铁研磨任务，也提前两天完成，并节约下五十个人工。现在广大职工正在继续安装中。
