Liling County in Hunan Province has completed the harvesting of over 653,000 mu of late rice. This year's late rice yield in the county is generally about 10% higher than last year, with agricultural production cooperatives showing an increase of 10% to 20% compared to last year. The Qianjin Agricultural Cooperative in Hongqiao Township, Third District, saw an average increase of 26.5% compared to last year. Cooperative member Wen Yixiu's "one-dou big field" yielded only 320 jin of late rice last year but produced 466 jin this year.

After the bumper late rice harvest, farmers throughout the county are actively engaged in winter plowing and winter planting. The Gaodeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Miaoquan Township, Seventh District, promptly planted 7.1 mu of rapeseed in the fields after harvesting the late rice. Influenced and driven by the agricultural production cooperative, the entire township completed a rapeseed planting plan of 150 mu.

The 44,000+ mu of late rice in Hanshou County, which were replanted after drainage, have now begun to be harvested. The late rice harvest is generally good. Xin'cheng Township in the Sixth District has harvested over 400 mu of late rice, with a yield of around 300 jin per mu. Mutual aid team member Mo Fangzhang in the township harvested 390 jin of rice from his one mu of late rice. The Hongxing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shuangtong Township, Fourth District, has harvested over 30 mu of the 52 mu of late rice that was reclaimed and replanted after drainage, averaging 450 jin per mu. Before harvesting the late rice, the cooperative rationally arranged labor, plowing and planting immediately after harvesting. The day after finishing the late rice harvest, rapeseed was planted in the fields. (Our Hunan reporter station)

    湖南醴陵汉寿等县晚稻丰收
    湖南醴陵县六十五万三千多亩晚稻，现已收割完毕。全县今年晚稻一般比去年增产一成左右，农业生产合作社比去年增产一成到两成。三区虹桥乡前进农业社平均比去年增产百分之二十六点五，社员温一修的“一斗大丘”，去年只收三百二十斤晚谷，今年收了四百六十六斤。
    晚稻丰收以后，全县农民又积极进行冬耕冬种。七区妙泉乡高等农业生产合作社在收完晚稻的田里及时种了七亩一分的油菜。在农业生产合作社的影响与带动下，全乡完成一百五十亩的油菜种植计划。
    汉寿县排涝补种的四万四千多亩晚稻，现已开始收割。晚稻收成一般还好。六区新成乡已收割晚稻四百多亩，每亩产量一般在三百斤左右。该乡互助组员莫方章的一亩晚稻，收了三百九十斤谷。四区双铜乡红星农业生产合作社经开荒和排涝抢种的五十二亩晚稻，已收了三十多亩，平均每亩合四百五十斤。该社在收割晚稻前，合理安排了劳动力，随收随即整理播种，第一天割完晚稻，第二天田里就种上了油菜。　（本报湖南记者站）
