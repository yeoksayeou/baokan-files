Letter to the Editor Abstracts

　　Field personnel in various departments should assist in mineral exploration work
　　Wang Fuchang of the Exploration Committee of the Ministry of Geology writes: At present, the work of mass reporting of mineral deposits has been widely launched throughout the country, which is of great help to the exploration of mineral resources in our motherland. I think that, in addition to the geological departments, there are many field personnel in other departments, such as those who specialize in investigating coal, petroleum, forests, aquatic products, and other field personnel engaged in specialized scientific research. When they are working in the field, they are likely to discover some valuable mineral outcrops on the surface. If, after discovering mineral outcrops, they tell the geological department the location and situation of the discovery, and collect some specimens for the geological department to analyze and test, this is easy to do. In addition, when they conduct propaganda, interviews or understanding with the local people in connection with their own work, they can also do some mineral reporting propaganda work.
　　Some field work teams have already done this; however, this issue still needs to attract widespread attention. There are a considerable number of field personnel across the country, whose footprints cover the mountains and forests of the motherland. If everyone can pay attention to exploring the rich treasures buried underground in the motherland while doing their own work well, it will be of great benefit to the geological department's exploration work and the construction of the motherland.
　　"International Games" are meaningless
　　Jiang Weitong, Du Keli, Xu Mingwen, Hu Xianrong, Wang Shaobo, and Zhang Shide of Chongqing University, Sichuan Province, write: Recently, we received a letter called "International Game". The content of the game stipulates that everyone who receives this letter must send an artistic painting, photo, or postcard to the address of the first name in the letter, and then rewrite four copies in the original letter form and send them to friends at home and abroad. According to the initiators, by doing so, everyone who participates in the game can get two hundred and fifty-six photos and "precious friendship." What are the consequences of continuing this "international game"? We believe it has the following two disadvantages:
　　First, people who participate in this game have to send out photos and five letters. In addition to wasting their own time and money, it will also affect more people and waste more manpower and materials.
　　Second, it spreads bourgeois selfish individualism. Because the people who receive this letter first feel the "benefit" of the "international game," that is, they can "earn back" two hundred and fifty-six photos or pictures with one photo, and thus unconsciously accept and spread this despicable exploitative thinking.
　　Moreover, this may also bring us political harm. Therefore, we hope to find a way to stop this harmful and useless "game" as soon as possible.
　　A strange toy
　　Cheng Junzhe, a reader from Changge County, Henan Province, writes: One day, I came to the livestock yard of an agricultural production cooperative in Zengfumiao Village and saw a group of children fighting over a toy; this toy was taller than the children and had four iron legs, two large iron wheels on both sides, and a long tail sticking out behind it. The children were having a lot of fun turning the big wheels, but as soon as the adults shouted, the children scattered and ran away, and as soon as the adults left, they came back one by one. I was very curious, what exactly were the children playing with? Looking closely, it turned out to be a broken chaff cutter. Its large wheels were broken, the small shaft on the central shaft was also rotten, and the blades were nowhere to be found. Where did this strange toy come from? It turned out that it was lent to the people by the Construction Section of the Changge County People's Government in 1951, worth more than 8 million yuan. At that time, it was said that this chaff cutter was an agricultural mechanization tool, which saved labor and was efficient... Unexpectedly, after cutting grass for two days, the middle wheel broke. This machine has been a children's toy for more than four years, but no one has ever cared about it.
　　Timely prevention of gas poisoning
　　Du Shujun of the Xinxiang City Labor Bureau in Henan Province writes: Xinxiang City attached importance to the work of preventing gas poisoning in 1953, ensuring that there were no deaths due to gas poisoning throughout the year. On the evening of October 9 this year, two workers from the Zhongyuan Textile Factory were accidentally poisoned by gas while sleeping. Fortunately, it was not long before they recovered their health after treatment and a day of rest. The Xinxiang City Safety and Health Committee has promptly issued a notice to all units, requiring everyone to be vigilant and take effective measures to prevent gas poisoning incidents.
　　Winter has arrived, and people in vast areas of the north have to light fires indoors for warmth. It is hoped that the relevant departments of the people's governments in all regions will be able to carry out the work of preventing gas poisoning in a timely manner to ensure the safety and health of the people.

专栏：来信摘要

    来信摘要
　　各部门野外工作人员应该协助进行矿藏普查工作
    地质部普查委员会王福昌来信：目前群众报矿的工作已在全国各地广泛展开，这对祖国矿藏的普查工作有很大帮助。我想到，除了地质部门以外，其他部门也有不少野外工作人员，如专门调查煤、石油、森林、水产及其他从事专门科学研究的野外工作人员等。他们在野外工作时，很可能发现一些有价值的暴露在地面的矿苗。如果他们在发现矿苗以后，把发现矿苗的地点和情况告诉地质部门，并采集一些标本供给地质部门分析、化验，这是很容易办到的。此外，他们在结合本身工作向所在地群众进行宣传、访问或了解时，还可以捎带做一些报矿宣传工作。
    目前有一些野外工作队已经这样做了；但是，这个问题还需要引起普遍的注意。全国野外工作人员数量不少，足迹遍于祖国各地的山野和林区，如果大家都能在做好本身工作的条件下，还捎带注意探查祖国埋藏在地下的丰富宝藏，这对地质部门的普查工作，对祖国的建设是有很大好处的。
　　“国际游戏”是没有意义的
    四川省重庆大学蒋维同、杜克礼、许明文、胡先荣、王绍伯、张世德来信：最近我们收到了一种叫做“国际游戏”的信，游戏的内容规定每一个接到这种信的人，都要按照信中第一个名字的地址寄出一张有艺术价值的画片或照片或者明信片，然后再照原信的形式重抄四封，分别寄给自己国内外的朋友。根据发起人的意思，这样做下去，每一个参加游戏的人，都可以得到二百五十六张照片和“珍贵的友谊”。这种“国际游戏”继续下去有什么结果呢？我们认为它有以下两个坏处：
    第一、参加这种游戏的人，要寄出相片和五封信，除了本身浪费了时间和金钱外，还要使更多的人受到影响，浪费更多的人力物力。
    第二、它散布着资产阶级自私自利的个人主义思想。因为接到这种信的人，首先感到“国际游戏”的“好处”，就是自己用一张照片可以“赚回”二百五十六张照片或画片，因而不自觉地接受并传播了这种卑鄙的剥削思想。
    而且，这还可能给我们带来政治上的危害。因此，希望赶快设法制止这种有害无益的“游戏”。
　　一件奇怪的玩具
    河南省长葛县读者成俊哲来信：一天，我来到增福庙村一个农业生产合作社的牲口院内，看到一群小孩在争着一个玩具；这个玩具比小孩高，还长着四个铁腿，两边两个大铁轮，后面还翘着一个长尾巴，小孩子们十分有趣地转着大轮子玩，只要大人们一吆喝，小孩们就四散跑开，大人一走，一个一个又回来了。我很奇怪，小孩到底玩的是啥东西呢？仔细一看，原来这是一个破烂的铡草机，它的大轮子已经碰断了，中轴上的小轴也烂了，刀片也无影无踪了。究竟这个奇怪玩具咋来的，原来是一九五一年，长葛县人民政府建设科贷给老百姓的，价值八百多万元。当时说这架铡草机是农业机械化的农具，既省劳力、效力又高……。不料铡了两天草，中间的小轮子就坏啦，这架机器变成小孩玩具已经四年多了，却从来没人过问。
　　及时预防煤气中毒
    河南新乡市劳动局杜淑君来信：新乡市各单位在一九五三年重视了预防煤气中毒的工作，保证全年没有发生因煤气中毒而死亡的事故。今年十月九日晚上，中原纱厂有两位工人同志睡觉时不慎中了煤毒，幸而时间不久经治疗后休息一天就恢复了健康。新乡市安全卫生委员会已经及时向各单位发出通报，要求大家提高警惕，采取有效措施来防止煤气中毒事件的发生。
    冬季已到，北方广大地区的人民都要在屋内生火取暖。希望各地人民政府有关部门都能及时开展预防煤气中毒的工作，保证人民的安全和健康。
