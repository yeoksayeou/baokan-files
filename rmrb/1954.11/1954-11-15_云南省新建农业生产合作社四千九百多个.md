    More Than Four Thousand Nine Hundred New Agricultural Production Cooperatives Established in Yunnan Province
    Yunnan Province's work on developing agricultural production cooperatives before the autumn harvest this year, which began in late August, concluded in early October. The province developed a total of 4,931 new cooperatives; the old cooperatives established this spring have also been expanded. In the development process, 22 cooperative villages and 460 cooperative villages emerged. While developing agricultural production cooperatives, year-round mutual aid teams also increased from more than 30,000 to more than 50,000, credit cooperatives increased from 600 to 2,439, and the number of supply and marketing cooperative members increased from 3.8 million to 4 million.
    Through the development of cooperatives, the socialist enthusiasm of cadres and the masses has been further enhanced, and the number of activists has generally increased. In the process of establishing cooperatives, party building was combined with the establishment of cooperatives, and the party organization was developed. More than 14,000 new party members were developed, and more than 740 new branches were established. There are now more than 31,000 party members and more than 3,230 branches in rural areas throughout the province.
    Currently, the province is consolidating these new cooperatives by organizing autumn plowing and planting. At the same time, it is re-establishing new mutual aid and cooperation networks, strengthening leadership over mutual aid teams, helping mutual aid teams solve problems such as work evaluation, work point recording, work settlement, and labor organization. Through production, it will further cultivate backbone activists to prepare for the development of cooperatives next spring. (Jing Ru)

    云南省新建农业生产合作社四千九百多个
    云南省今年秋收前发展农业生产合作社的工作，自八月底开始至十月上旬已结束。全省共发展了四千九百三十一个新社；今春建立的老社也都有了扩大。发展中出现了二十二个合作化的乡，四百六十个合作化的村。在发展农业生产合作社的同时，常年互助组也由三万多个增加到五万多个，信用合作社由六百个发展到二千四百三十九个，供销合作社社员由三百八十万发展到四百万。
    通过发展合作社，干部、群众的社会主义积极性有了进一步的提高，积极分子普遍有了增长。建社中结合建党，发展了党的组织，新发展的党员有一万四千多人，新建支部七百四十多个。全省农村现共有党员三万一千多人，支部有三千二百三十多个。
    现在全省正在通过组织秋耕秋种，来巩固这批新社，同时重新建立新的互助合作网，加强对互助组的领导，帮助互助组解决评工记分、清工结账、劳动组织等问题，通过生产，进一步培养骨干积极分子，为明春的发展合作社进行准备。（静如）
