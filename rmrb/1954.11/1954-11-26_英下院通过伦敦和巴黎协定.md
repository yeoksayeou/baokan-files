(Xinhua News Agency, London, November 21st) The British House of Commons debated the government's proposal to approve the London and Paris Agreements on the 17th and 18th.

    Foreign Secretary Eden spoke first at the start of the debate. He tried his best to defend the Western countries' policies of arming West Germany and maintaining the division of Germany. He opposed holding talks with the Soviet Union to resolve the issue of German reunification before approving the London and Paris Agreements, insisting that passing the London and Paris Agreements would improve "negotiating opportunities."

    Former Labor Foreign Secretary Morrison spoke on behalf of the opposition party. He admitted that negotiations should be held with the Soviet Union, but he also supported the London and Paris Agreements, thus supporting the Conservative government's policy of remilitarizing West Germany.

    Labor left-wing members of Parliament Bevan and Crossman expressed disagreement with the rearmament of West Germany in their speeches. Bevan refuted the claim that arming West Germany would strengthen the West's negotiating position, pointing out that it would increase military spending and poison the atmosphere for negotiations. He also warned that if German troops under the command of Nazi officers possessed atomic bombs, the British people would be threatened by war. Bevan emphasized: "The international crisis in Western Europe is not a problem of relations between Britain and the Soviet Union, but a problem of relations between Western Europe and the United States."

    Labor leader Attlee admitted that rearming West Germany was a risky thing, but he still demanded that this policy be implemented as soon as possible, while holding talks at the same time.

    Conservative Prime Minister Churchill stated in response to questions raised by members of parliament: The British government's policy is to "exhaust all means to secure the approval of the London and Paris Agreements," and then conduct negotiations on the basis of a rearmed West Germany.

    On the evening of the 18th, the House of Commons hastily held a vote, and the result was that the London and Paris Agreements were approved by 264 votes to 4. The Labor Party's right-wing leaders originally threatened to use party discipline to force Labor members to vote in favor of approving these agreements, but finally changed their decision and allowed them to abstain. Reuters pointed out that the Labor Party leader did this to avoid internal divisions.

    An important fact is that just as Eden was giving his closing remarks in the debate, some British youth threw leaflets opposing the rearmament of West Germany into the House of Commons, which shows that the decision of the House of Commons is contrary to the will of the true British people.

### 英下院通过伦敦和巴黎协定

    英下院通过伦敦和巴黎协定
    【新华社二十一日讯】伦敦消息：英国议会下院在十七日和十八日就政府要求批准伦敦协定和巴黎协定的提案进行辩论。
    外交大臣艾登在辩论开始时首先发言。他竭力为西方国家武装西德、保持德国分裂的政策辩护，反对在批准伦敦和巴黎协定前与苏联会谈解决统一德国的问题，硬说通过伦敦协定和巴黎协定才会改进“谈判机会”。
    前工党外交大臣摩里逊代表反对党发言。他承认应该同苏联谈判，但是又拥护伦敦协定和巴黎协定，因此支持了保守党政府使西德重新军国主义化的政策。
    工党左翼议员比万和克罗斯曼在发言中表示不同意重新武装西德。比万驳斥那种说武装西德可以加强西方谈判的地位的说法，指出这将增加军费负担，毒害谈判的气氛。他还警告说：在纳粹军官指挥下的德国军队如果拥有了原子弹，英国人民将受战争的威胁。比万强调指出：“西欧的国际危机并不是英国同苏联的关系问题，而是西欧同美国的关系问题。”
    工党首领艾德礼承认重新武装西德是冒险的事情，但是他还是要求尽快执行这种政策，同时进行会谈。
    保守党首相邱吉尔在答复议员提出的问题时表示：英国政府的政策是“用尽一切方法使伦敦协定和巴黎协定获得批准”，然后在重新武装了西德的基础上再来进行谈判。
    十八日晚，下院草草进行表决，表决结果，以二百六十四票对四票批准了伦敦协定和巴黎协定。工党右翼领袖原来以党纪威胁，要工党议员投票赞成批准这些协定，但最后改变决定，让他们弃权。路透社指出，工党领袖这样做是为了避免党内分裂。
    一件意义重要的事实是，正当艾登在作结束辩论发言时，一些英国青年把反对重新武装西德的传单投进了下院，这说明，下院的决定是违反真正英国人民的意志的。
