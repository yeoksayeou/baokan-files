Soviet Scientists Participating in the Exhibition

General Director of the Soviet Agricultural Exhibition
Academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences Ni· Qijin

In the Soviet Union, there are many research institutes, experimental farms, and experimental stations studying issues in various agricultural sectors. The All-Union Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences possesses an extensive network of scientific institutions and experimental stations. The fact that over a thousand scientific research institutions are participating in the All-Union Agricultural Exhibition alone sufficiently illustrates this point. The achievements of these institutions are displayed in the various pavilions of the exhibition.

In the "Agriculture," "Grain," "Urals," and "Mechanization" pavilions, the methods for increasing yields researched by collective farm scientist Maltsev are widely displayed. This outstanding innovator has made discoveries of great scientific and practical significance, and his name has spread throughout the country. His recent speech at the All-Union Agricultural Exhibition aroused great interest.

The exhibits at the exhibition clearly convince people that Soviet agriculture is equipped with various powerful machines. In the post-war years alone, Soviet agriculture has received approximately one million tractors, one hundred and seventeen thousand "Stalinets-6" trailed grain combine harvesters, one hundred and eleven thousand "С—4" self-propelled grain combine harvesters, and many other agricultural machines and implements. In our countryside, many newly built collective farm, multi-collective farm, and state power stations begin supplying electricity every year.

Soviet scientists have created first-class sowing and harvesting machines. In the past two years, many machines that can be used to plant potatoes and vegetables using the square cluster planting method and the square planting method have been manufactured. Thanks to these machines, the labor expenditure is reduced to one-tenth to one-twentieth, greatly increasing the yield.

Among the various new types of machines for applying manure, peat, lime, mineral fertilizers, and other fertilizers, the universal machine created by designers of the Gomel Agricultural Machinery Manufacturing Plant with the participation of staff from the Soviet Fertilizer, Agricultural Technology, and Agricultural Soil Science Institute has aroused great interest.

The Soviet Institute of Agricultural Electrification was granted the right to participate in the exhibition. Participating in the exhibition were the director of the institute, Master of Technical Sciences U.F. Vorobyov, and the director of a laboratory of the institute, Full Member of the Soviet Academy of Agricultural Sciences M.G. Yevreinov.

The Soviet Institute of Agricultural Mechanization, which designed many new types of agricultural machines and accessories for these machines, also participated in the exhibition. The director of this institute, A.I. Buyanov, is the founder of a new method of operating combine harvesters to harvest grain.

Relying on the advanced production experience of collective farms and state farms, Soviet science is increasingly gaining a deeper understanding of the laws of nature, pointing out the path to transforming nature for the benefit of mankind. Our scientists have proven that it is entirely possible to turn barren soil into fertile soil that can consistently produce abundant harvests of various crops. New and valuable varieties of plants and breeds of livestock have been created based on Michurin's theories. For example, the Soviet Institute of Plant Cultivation has established rare and most valuable materials for breeding, cultivated approximately four hundred varieties of various crops, made valuable contributions to solving the problems of northern agriculture, studied methods of reclaiming semi-desert areas, and achieved many successes in plant cultivation in various regions.

Certain achievements have been made in researching the biological issues of livestock breeding, in breeding new livestock breeds, and in improving existing livestock breeds. The work of M.F. Ivanov and the famous livestock breeders S.I. Shteiman and K.D. Filyansky, who bred new livestock breeds with higher productivity, has received well-deserved honor.

The participant of the exhibition—the Soviet Livestock Breeding Research Institute—has carried out tremendous work in organizing livestock breeding experimental farms and researching the important theories for developing livestock science. Ten staff members from this institute participated in the exhibition, including the director of the institute, Professor I.M. Kuznetsov.

The Soviet Institute of Microbiology has effectively used bacterial fertilizers—soybean rhizobia—and researched the bacterial fertilizer "AMB," which has already been put into production.

The exhibition also showcased the achievements of Soviet science in hydraulic engineering and soil improvement, demonstrating new irrigation systems, highly efficient irrigation technologies, new hydraulic structures, and methods to combat water waste.

Exhibition participant and Stalin Prize winner Professor P.A. Mandeyfel founded a new scientific discipline—semi-captive breeding, which is of great significance for enriching hunting areas.

Many scientific experts are working to solve the task of further improving agriculture. Botanists are studying wild plants, from which materials can be selected for the cultivation and hybridization of crops. Physiologists are studying the functions of various parts of plants. Biochemists are deeply studying the phenomena of biological metabolism. Plant anatomy experts are studying the tissue structure and cell structure of plants.

Currently, the issue of correctly utilizing depressions and river bends and making every effort to increase the fertility of these soils has attracted special attention from scientists and practitioners.

The exhibition demonstrates that Soviet agricultural science has achieved remarkable achievements. The collective farm system has opened up broad avenues for the further development of agricultural science and the solution of many important problems.

    参加展览会的苏联科学家
    苏联农业展览会总干事
    苏联科学院院士  尼·齐津
    在苏联，有很多研究农业各部门问题的研究所、实验场和实验站。全苏列宁农业科学院拥有广泛的科学机关和试验站网。仅只参加全苏农业展览会的就有一千多个科学研究机关这一事实，便充分地说明了这点。这些机关的成就，展出在展览会的各个展览馆里。
    在“农业”、“谷物”、“乌拉尔”和“机械化”展览馆里广泛地展出了集体农庄科学家马尔采夫所研究出的提高收获量的方法。这位卓越的革新者，做出了具有巨大科学意义和实践意义的发现，他的名字已经传遍了全国。最近他在全苏农业展览会上所做的演说引起了人们极大的兴趣。
    展览会上的展览品明显地使人确信，苏联的农业是用各种威力强大的机器装备起来的。仅在战后的年代中，苏联农业就得到了约一百万架拖拉机、十一万七千架“斯大林涅茨—六号”曳引谷物收割联合机、十一万一千架“С—4”型自动谷物收割联合机和很多其它农业机器和农具。在我国的农村中，每年都有许多新建的集体农庄的、几个集体农庄公用的和国家的发电站开始送电。
    苏联的科学家制造了头等的播种和收割用的机器。最近两年来制造出了很多可以用来按正方穴播法和正方栽种法栽种马铃薯和蔬菜的机器。赖有这些机器，使劳动的耗费缩减到十分之一至二十分之一，大大地提高了收获量。
    在各种新型的施用粪肥、泥炭、石灰、矿物肥料和别的肥料的机器中，引起人们极大兴趣的是在苏联肥料、农业技术和农业土壤学研究所工作人员参加之下，由哥美尔斯克农业机器制造厂设计师创造的万能机。
    苏联农业电气化研究所获得了参加展览会的权利。参加展览会的有该研究所所长、技术科学硕士乌·弗·伏罗伯耶夫和研究所的一个实验室主任、苏联农业科学院正式研究员马·格·耶夫列伊诺夫。
    设计了许多新型农业机器和这些机器附件的苏联农业机械化研究所也参加了展览会。这个研究所的所长阿·伊·布雅诺夫是收割联合机收割谷物的新操作法的创始者。
    依靠集体农庄和国营农场的先进生产经验，苏维埃科学愈益较深入地认识到自然的法则，指出为了人类的利益去改造自然的道路。我们的科学家证明了完全可以把贫瘠的土壤变为经常能使各种农作物得到丰收的沃土。根据米丘林的学说创造了新的珍贵的植物品种和家畜品种。例如，苏联植物栽培研究所为选种创立了稀有的最宝贵的资料，培养了约四百种各种作物品种，对解决北方农业问题作了有价值的贡献，研究了开垦半沙漠地带的方法，使各个地区的植物栽培获得了很多成就。
    在研究牲畜繁殖的生物学问题方面，在培育新的牲畜品种和改良现有牲畜品种方面都获得了一定的成就。马·弗·伊凡诺夫和培育了新的、产品生产率较大的牲畜品种的著名的饲畜家斯·伊·西迭伊曼和克·得·费梁斯基的工作，得到了应得的荣誉。
    展览会的参加者——苏联饲畜业研究所在组织饲畜业试验场和研究发展饲畜科学的重要理论方面进行了巨大的工作。这个研究所有十个工作人员参加了展览会，其中有研究所所长依·姆·库兹涅佐夫教授。
    苏联微生物学研究所有效地使用了细菌肥料——大豆根瘤菌，研究出细菌肥料“АМБ”，并且已经运用到生产中了。
    展览会也展出了苏维埃科学在水力工程学和改良土壤方面的成就，展示出新的灌溉系统、生产效能非常高的灌溉技术、新的水利建筑和同浪费水流做斗争的方法。
    展览会参加者斯大林奖金获得者帕·阿·曼迭伊费利教授创立了一门新的科学学科——半饲养学，这门学科对充实狩猎区有很重要的意义。
    很多科学专家正在解决进一步提高农业的任务。植物学家在研究野生植物，从这些野生植物中可以为农作物的栽培和杂交选择资料。生理学家在研究植物各部分的功用。生物化学家在深入地研究生物的新陈代谢的现象。植物解剖学专家在研究植物的组织结构和细胞结构。
    目前，正确地利用洼地和河湾地，尽力增加这些土壤的肥沃程度的问题引起了科学家和实践工作者的特别注意。
    展览会显示出苏联农业科学已经达到了卓越成就。集体农庄制度为农业科学进一步发展和解决许多重要问题开辟了广阔的道路。
