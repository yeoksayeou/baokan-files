    On the Highway in the Bomi Area
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Lü Huanxiang
    I recently took a car trip on the highway in the Bomi area of the Kangzang Plateau. With the improvement of transportation conditions, this area is undergoing new changes.
    For a long time, due to inconvenient transportation, this area with its warm climate and abundant resources was almost completely isolated from the outside world. To the east of the Bomi area is the natural barrier of the Nu River, and to the north and south are snow-capped peaks all year round. To the west, mountains of four to five thousand meters high hinder its connection with the Gongbu area. In the rainy summer, the rugged mountain roads in the territory are often destroyed by floods, and it is very difficult to walk from one village to another. Although the Tibetan people repair plank roads and build rope bridges every year, they still cannot change this situation. When we passed through Bomi this spring, it took us more than ten days to complete this rugged mountain road; now it only takes more than a day by car to cross Bomi.
    After the car descended from a large mountain on the west bank of the Nu River, it entered the Bomi area. There is a road maintenance team station beside the highway, which used to have only two households, but now it has become a lively small market town. Rows of new houses have been built at the foot of the mountain, and white smoke is rising from the woods on the opposite hillside, where workers are burning lime. There is also a sawmill in the forest above, supplying the wood needed for nearby construction sites. Zhamu is the largest new market town in the Bomi area, and a new batch of buildings has been added in the past two months. The construction worker sanatorium has been completed, and the auditorium and office building are also nearing completion; in addition to the original electricity, a charcoal generator recently added has also begun to supply power. A construction plan with an area of several thousand square meters has been designed and will soon begin construction. After the completion of this project, Zhamu will become the central town of the Bomi area.
    I once visited the state-owned Bomi Trading Branch Company. The retail department is often crowded with farmers and herdsmen buying things. The types of goods supplied in this retail department have reached more than 700. During the rainy season, rubber shoes from East China and umbrellas from Chengdu were transported here, and recently a batch of silk and other daily necessities were transported here. In the few months that the highway has been open to traffic, nearly ten tons of goods have been sold, most of which are tea and salt. In order to meet the needs of the people, the trading company also sends mobile trading teams along the highway. Postal and telecommunications services between the Bomi area and the mainland are also smooth. Various books, newspapers, and magazines have been transported from the mainland to this remote area, and the people along the highway can already see movies and newly published Tibetan books and newspapers.
    The severe winter is coming, and the snow on the high mountains around the Bomi area is even thicker. In previous years, this was the time when transportation between Bomi and the outside world was almost cut off. Now, it is the busy season for highway transportation. Long convoys loaded with various materials are heading towards the current end of the highway. Mules, horses, and carts are also constantly traveling on the flat and wide highway.

### 在波密地区的公路线上

    在波密地区的公路线上
    新华社记者　吕焕祥
    最近我乘汽车在康藏高原波密地区的公路上作了一次旅行。随着交通条件的改善，这个地区正在发生着新的变化。
    很久以来，因为交通不便，这个气候温暖、物产丰富的地区，几乎完全和外界隔绝。波密地区的东面是怒江天险，北面和南面都是常年积雪的高峰，往西去有四、五千公尺高山阻碍着它和工布地区的联系。在多雨的夏季里，境内的崎岖山道常被洪水冲毁，从这个村子走到那个村子也是十分困难的。藏族人民虽然年年修栈道、架蹓索桥，但仍然不能改变这个情况。今年春天我们路过波密时，走了十多天才走完这段崎岖的山路；现在坐汽车只要一天多就可以横穿波密了。
    汽车下了怒江西岸的一座大山以后，就进入了波密区。公路边有一个道班房，这里过去只有两户人家，现在已经变成一个热闹的小集镇了。山脚下兴建起一排排的新房屋，对面山坡上的树林里冒着白烟，工人们正在那里烧石灰，上面的大森林里还有一个锯木厂，供应着附近建筑工地需要的木材。札木是波密区最大的新集镇，最近两个月来又增加了一批新建筑。建筑工人疗养院已经落成，大礼堂和办公楼也快要完工；除原有的电力外，最近增加的一个木炭发电机，也已开始送电。一个几千平方公尺面积的建筑计划已经设计完毕，不久即可动工兴建，这一工程完工后，札木将成为波密区的中心城镇。
    我曾经访问了国营波密贸易支公司。门市部里经常挤满了购买东西的农民、牧民。在这个门市部里供应的货物种类已达七百多种。雨季期间曾经运来了华东的胶鞋、成都的雨伞，最近又运来了一批绸缎和其他日用品。在公路通车的几个月里，已经销售了近十吨的货物，其中绝大部分是茶叶和食盐。为了满足人民的需要，贸易公司还在公路沿线派出流动贸易组。波密区和内地的邮电也畅通了。各种书报、杂志从内地运送到这个偏僻的地区来了，公路沿线的人民已经可以看到电影和新出版的藏文书报。
    严冬来临，波密区四周高山上的积雪更厚了。往年这个时候，正是波密和外界交通近于断绝的时候，现在，却正是公路运输繁忙的时节，长长的车队满载着各种物资，驰向目前公路通车的终点。骡马、大车也络绎不绝地来往在平坦宽阔的公路上。
