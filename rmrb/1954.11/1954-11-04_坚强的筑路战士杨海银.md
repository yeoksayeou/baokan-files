In the People's Liberation Army unit building the Kangzang Highway, there is a young soldier named Yang Haiyin. He broke a leg while building the road. After treatment and hard training, he stubbornly held on to his job. Although his body was disabled, his enthusiasm for building the frontier of the motherland continued to burn.

Yang Haiyin has been in the Chinese People's Liberation Army for seven years. In 1951, after his unit arrived in the Kangzang Plateau, it was responsible for building the Kangzang Highway. Because he had the enthusiasm to serve the Tibetan people and build the frontier of the motherland, he researched and created many advanced operating methods in road construction and was rated as a Special Class Meritorious Person. When the troops first came to the area east of the Jinsha River from the inland, everyone was not used to working in areas with thin air, and it was difficult to master the operating skills of various tools. Yang Haiyin was one of the fastest to master the essentials of using a sledgehammer. On the Que'er Mountain, which is more than 5,000 meters above sea level, he swung an eight-pound hammer more than a thousand times in one breath, and was praised by the soldiers as a "Thousand Hammer Hero." While working on the Bangda Prairie, he served as a squad leader. He helped the soldiers in his squad create an operating method of piercing the turf with a steel drill, which increased the work efficiency of digging turf by more than double. On the west bank of the Nu River, the troops had no experience in loosening rocks. He studied the methods created by fraternal units and improved them, promoting them to the entire battalion and regiment.

On the evening of November 9, 1953, he was working under an earth embankment more than ten meters high. The frozen soil on the top of the embankment, which had been burned by fire, suddenly collapsed and buried him. When the soldiers rescued him from the soil, the bone of his right calf had already been broken. While asking the soldier Guo Desheng to straighten his leg, he firmly said to his comrades in the squad: Comrades! Don't be sad, I will work with you again in a few days.

After Yang Haiyin arrived at the sanatorium, he once thought: I'm so young and I've become disabled, can I still participate in frontier construction? But he never forgot the road construction work. The scene of the soldiers in the squad working hard clearly appeared in his memory, and he still pondered day and night the knack of improving operating techniques. One day, the团 (regiment) Party committee sent an organization assistant to visit him, and left him a book describing the volunteer army heroine Zhang Daohua when he left. After reading this book, he was moved by the heroic deeds of this girl. He thought to himself: Zhang Daohua is blind but learned to write articles to continue working for the people, am I discouraged because I broke a leg? The next day, he immediately wrote a letter to Regiment Commander Chai Hongquan, drew a picture of the winch-lifting method that he had spent two or three nights thinking about, and suggested that it be adopted when opening stone cliffs in the next phase of the project.

Later, after reading the story and watching the film "The Real Man" of the Soviet Union, he decided to practice walking. At the beginning, he could only walk a few steps with two crutches before falling. He continued to get up and practice again. When he realized that his right foot could support some strength, he shouted happily: I can start walking. So he began to drop one crutch. After a few days, he dropped the other one. Every day, he practiced walking up and down the small hill behind the sanatorium. Three months later, he was finally discharged from the hospital, but his right leg was more than an inch shorter than his left leg. The regiment wanted him to return to the inland, but he repeatedly requested to continue staying in the unit. At this time, the troops were preparing to transfer the construction site, and he practiced climbing steep slopes every day to prepare for the march. Although the instructor talked to him several times and asked him to continue recuperating, he still insisted on transferring with everyone.

After construction started, he climbed up and down the seventeen-meter-high rope ladder like other comrades and participated in various road construction tasks. During the days of day and night shifts, he went down to the six-meter-deep gun holes with the soldiers to swing the hammer. No one could tell that he was a person who had broken his leg. His strong will encouraged the labor enthusiasm of all the comrades in the company, and the squad he was in always maintained the honor of having the highest work efficiency in the entire company.

    坚强的筑路战士杨海银
    新华社记者　林田
    在中国人民解放军修建康藏公路的部队里，有一个名叫杨海银的青年战士，他在修路中折断了一条腿，经过治疗和苦练后，仍然坚强地守住了他的工作岗位，他的身体虽然残废了，但他建设祖国边疆的热情继续燃烧着。
    杨海银参加中国人民解放军已经七年了。一九五一年，他所在的部队到了康藏高原以后，一直担负着修筑康藏公路的任务。由于他有着为藏族人民服务和建设祖国边疆的热情，在筑路中研究和创造了很多先进的操作方法，被评为特等功臣。部队刚从内地来到金沙江以东地区时，大家都不习惯在空气稀薄的地区施工，掌握各种工具的操作技术都很困难。杨海银却是掌握打大锤要领最快的一个，在拔海五千多公尺的雀儿山上，他抡起八磅重的铁锤一气打了一千多锤，被战士们称誉为“千锤英雄”。在邦达草原施工时，他担任着班长的职务，他帮助本班战士创造了钢钎穿草皮的操作方法，使挖草皮的工作效率提高了一倍多。在怒江西岸，部队没有开松石的经验，他学习兄弟部队创造的方法，并加以改进，推广到全营全团。
    一九五三年十一月九日的晚上，他正在一个十多公尺高的土坎下工作，土坎上面被火烧化的冻土，突然塌下来把他埋住了。当战士们把他从土里救出来的时候，右小腿的骨头已经折断了。他一面叫战士郭德生拉直他的腿，一面坚定地对班里的同志说：同志们！别难过，过几天我还会和你们一起工作的。
    杨海银到了休养所以后，曾经这样想过：年青青的就成了残废，还能参加边疆建设吗？但他却一直没有忘记修路工作，班里战士们努力干活的情景清晰地浮现在他的记忆里，他仍然日夜苦思着改进操作技术的窍门。有一天团党委派组织助理员来慰问他，临走时给他留下一本描写志愿军女英雄张道华的书。他读了这本书以后，被这个姑娘的英雄事迹感动了。他暗自想道：张道华双眼失明还学会写文章继续给人民工作，我断了一条腿就灰心了吗？第二天他马上写了一封信给团长柴洪泉，把他费了两三夜功夫想出来的辘轳吊石头的办法，画了一个图，建议下期工程开石崖时采用。
    以后，他看了苏联“真正的人”的故事和电影，决心练习走路。开始扶两根拐杖走不几步就摔倒了。他继续爬起来再练，当他发觉右脚可以支持住一些力量时，高兴得叫道：可以开步走了。于是开始丢掉一根拐杖。过了几天，又丢掉另一根。每天在休养所后面的小山上练习上下山走路，三个月以后他终于出院了，但右腿已比左腿短一寸多。团里要他回内地去，他一再请求继续留在部队。这时部队正准备转移工地，他每天都练习爬陡坡准备行军，虽然指导员几次谈话要他继续休养，他还是坚持着和大家一起转移。
    开工以后，他和其他同志一样在十七公尺高的绳梯上爬上爬下，参加各种筑路工作。昼夜轮班施工的日子里，他和战士们一起下到六公尺深的炮眼里抡锤，已经没有人能觉察到他是一个曾经断过腿的人了。他的坚强意志鼓舞了全连同志的劳动热情，他所在的班始终保持着全连工作效率最高的荣誉。
