    Aristophanes - A Great Patriotic Comedy Writer
    Li Jianwu
    Aristophanes was the greatest comedy writer of ancient Greece, and one of the greatest comedy writers in the world. He was a citizen of Athens, born around 446 BC and died around 385 BC. He wrote forty-four works, and although only eleven have been passed down, they are still full of life after more than two thousand years, and do not have a sense of isolation due to the long years.
    He inherited the folk comedy tradition, quickly reflected the times, and created a wonderful realm. No language can define the characteristics of his comedy. His brushstrokes are sometimes heavenly, sometimes earthly; sometimes human and divine, sometimes bird and beast; sometimes metaphorical, sometimes explicitly critical; sometimes refined, sometimes rough; sometimes serious, sometimes relaxed; a piece from the east, a piece from the west, like a patchwork quilt, but seamless; the style is ever-changing, but the soul of the poet is everywhere. The plot is virtual, the encounters are bizarre, but the actions are realistic, the characters are realistic, the language is sparkling and jumping, and every sentence is meaningful. Reality and fantasy are condensed here into a perfect harmonious imaginative activity. Walking into his comedy world, later generations feel dazzled, as if they have arrived at a new garden they have never been to before, and it is difficult to imagine that the flowers and trees of European comedy have sprung up from here.
    He not only established the lively, free, and popular tradition of comedy's surprise victories, but was also the first great writer with strong political inclinations. In his comedic masterpiece "The Frogs", he was the first to point out the major tasks of literature. Before the end of the play, in addition to general standards, he put forward a final and most decisive standard, that is, the poet's political contribution to the motherland. "The Frogs" is a dramatic comedy work. In 406 BC, the two great Athenian tragedians Euripides and Sophocles passed away one after another. Dionysus, the patron saint of tragedy, felt great loneliness and grief. He decided to go to the underworld to bring Euripides back to the world. After many dangerous journeys, he discovered that Euripides was fighting with Aeschylus, the father of tragedy, for the throne of tragedy in the underworld. He acted as the arbitrator of their dispute. Dionysus declared that he would take the winner back to the world, and the winner would be determined by "who has the most useful idea for the country". At the same time, Aeschylus questioned Euripides, "What does a poet rely on to be respected?" The answer was also: "Helping the country to teach the people." Just as Aeschylus won the victory and was about to leave, the main god of the underworld bid farewell:
        “Then, farewell, Aeschylus, go happily
    on your way. Come up with good ideas to save your
    hometown, find a way to enlighten those fools - there are many fools
    there.”
    In Aristophanes' view, the poet must first be a responsible citizen. Drama is not just for entertainment. The poet's task is to "help the country teach the people." Because of Aristophanes' courageous, responsible, upright, and kind wishes, things that seemed out of place in his comedy creation were all unified under his subjective intentions. That is to say, sharpness is for healing, going to heaven and earth is for saving the world, and watching and waving hands, being broad-minded, is for releasing higher glory.
    The poet loves the motherland, whether it is a major or minor matter, regardless of whether it is related to personal matters, he actively participates in it as his civic responsibility, expressing a clear attitude through rich and colorful styles, either praising or criticizing. Because of his concern for the motherland, his works are full of fighting spirit. In his works, he exposes corrupt civil and military officials, and he rebukes petty people who only seek profit. He loves the honor of the motherland above all else, so his attacks on all kinds of people who endanger the motherland are especially fierce. The battle is so intense that it is close combat.
    Although the comedies he wrote in his later years were oppressed by the objective political environment and could not speak freely, even in "Women in the Assembly" and "Plutus", we see that the poet does not escape reality, nor does he abandon politics and society, and remain indifferent. The writing motivation of "Women in the Assembly" was obviously because he was saddened by the state affairs. Here we see groups of women, wearing their husbands' clothes and hats, unexpectedly seizing power. The poet encourages housewives who do not ask about foreign affairs to intervene in politics, because "the advisers of the republic are all bad. If one of them occasionally does a good deed for a day, they have the right to do bad things for ten days in a row." Fishing in troubled waters has become a common trick for politicians. A man in despair said, "Give power to women, this is the only new method that Athens has not tried." The poet's satire is only for: how can the country get on the right track. He finally understood that to completely restore stability, it must be solved from the root. For a defeated country, to become strong again, it must first establish an economic foundation. Athens is poor, Athenian citizens are poor, and social phenomena here naturally reflect the basic problem of national revival. So he wrote "Plutus". In "Plutus", he was the first to inspire European economists to consider the phenomenon of poverty and wealth. In "Plutus", he proposed using morality as a fair standard for poverty and wealth. Naturally, due to the poor economic conditions at the time, Aristophanes was in the historical limitations of the time, and he could not answer the questions he raised himself.
    He was the first to raise such questions to mankind, which also shows that his comedy art is active on how broad a realistic thematic foundation.
    And the theme of the work can be closely integrated with the situation of the country and the wishes of the people, which is the result of the poet's in-depth understanding of life. He goes into real life to understand politics. His comedies show a highly realistic artistic technique, and do not stay on naturalistic sketches. The reason why he can achieve such high achievements in art is because he has a general principle of serving politics in his heart. He loves life, loves ideals, and loves the motherland.
    His other comedic masterpiece "The Birds" seems to be built in the air on the surface, but it is actually firmly established on the wishes of the Athenian people. Two Athenian citizens, Pisthetaerus and Euelpides, leave their homeland and visit the Hoopoe, hoping to find a country where they can "sleep comfortably, as comfortable as sleeping on a big leather mattress," because they are "citizens who oppose jury duty." They talked to the birds about their ancestors, who commanded the world, and gods and men were in awe, unlike today, where they are threatened everywhere. They awakened the birds' sense of honor, built a strong city in mid-air, cut off the communication between gods and men, helped mankind escape from disasters, and became true good neighbors and friends of mankind. The gods who bullied the birds surrendered. Athenians flocked to "Cloudcuckooland," this ethereal land of happiness, but Pisthetaerus, who became the king of the bird country, resolutely drove away those poets, prophets, numerologists, inspectors, rebellious sons, dancers, lawyers, etc. who specialized in speculation. The poet clearly told his audience that if Athens wants to be rich and strong, it should expel these scum who are harmful to the group.
    In his other comedic masterpiece "The Wasps," he used all his strength to awaken his compatriots. In "The Birds," there are two "citizens who oppose jury duty," but here a large number of jurors appear. When they were young, they were all soldiers who defended the motherland. Now that they are old, they are scrambling to be jurors, because they can get three obols (currency name) for being a juror for a day. After being jurors for a long time, they developed the character and habits of wasps, because when they get angry, they are like wasps; because they go to court in groups to be jurors; because they try every means to extort citizens who are involved in litigation. The poet wants them to cherish their past honor. What they should be particularly embarrassed about is that many of the jurors have never taken a spear, never wielded an oar, and never shed a drop of blood for the motherland. And these old people who have made great contributions to the country now sell their honor for three obols. Increasing juror allowances was a disguised bribery method used by Cleon, the person in power at the time, to buy people's hearts. The old warriors thought they deserved it, so the poet pointed out in "The Wasps" that the total amount of all allowances was less than one-tenth of the national income, and the other nine-tenths went into the pockets of people who claimed to
  “We will never sell public welfare.” They supported Cleon only to help him do evil and become his political speculation capital and tools for his evil deeds.
    As early as before "The Wasps" was staged, Aristophanes had continuously attacked Cleon, the owner of a leather workshop, in his comedies. And the biggest and most violent concentrated attack was his comedy "The Knights." In other comedies, Cleon only appeared through the dialogue of characters, but in "The Knights," he met the audience face-to-face as the main character. When this comedy was staged, it was during the period when Cleon's prestige reached its peak. It took unparalleled fighting courage for the poet to do this. In "The Wasps," the chorus talked about the poet's fearless spirit, pointing out:
        “If someone sees him mocking his
    lover in the play, gets angry and comes to complain to him, he doesn’t care
    at all, because he only has an upright motive; his
    muse is not a prostitute. Since he started his drama career, he
    has disdained to argue with ordinary people, but has mustered the courage of ancient
    heroes to specialize in fighting ferocious monsters…” But at this time, this “monster” was very popular, and no actor dared to accept the order to play the role. No mask maker was willing to make a Cleon mask for the actor to wear. The poet did not back down. He put on makeup himself to play the role of Cleon.
    In the play, Cleon is a servant who is trusted by the foolish and old Demos (common people). Relying on flowery words, he gained the blind trust of the citizens' assembly, "the rich are afraid of him, and the poor shiver when they see him." He not only did not sincerely help Demos, but also did not feel sorry for him at all. He imprisoned him for eight years and ruined his eyes with smoke; he tore up the peace treaty with Sparta, and the envoys who suggested a truce were kicked out of the city gate by him. The poet found a competitive rival for him in the play, a sausage seller. The sausage seller revealed his privacy in the rebuttal, saying: "You don't take Athens' rule in Arcadia to heart; you only care about plundering the allied states and forcing them to take out more donations. You support the war in order to fish in troubled waters and cover up the bad things you do in secret, and the people have no way out but to reach out to you." The sausage seller finally defeated Cleon and demoted Cleon to the street to sell sausages to foreigners, "because he used to insult them casually."
    We can see that the poet launched an attack on the powerful Cleon mainly because he and his war group brought disaster of no food and clothing to Athens. They sent the navy abroad to carry out large-scale economic plunder. The Greek brothers who once worked together to resist foreign enemies have now become enemies who repay each other with vengeance due to their clever plundering. History proves that Aristophanes' years of struggle for the peaceful coexistence of Greek city-states conformed to the wishes of the people and belonged to just actions.
    However, he does not oppose all wars. He often relies on the chorus to praise the battles of Marathon and Salamis. The ancestors once defeated the huge Persian expeditionary army with fewer troops at the critical moment of the survival of the entire Greece. This was a war for the motherland, a glorious war against aggression. The war presided over by the workshop owners and the like only brought poverty, riots, and humiliation to the motherland. Athens has forgotten that the defeat of the Persian invasion was the result of the Greek brothers working together and fighting side by side. Victory was exchanged for the prosperity of Athens. But now it is like having an irreconcilable hatred, clenching their fists and killing each other. Aristophanes loves the motherland because the motherland was once a good example of peaceful coexistence among brothers, because it once led them, through life and death, to defeat the common enemy.
    His earliest surviving comedy masterpiece "The Acharnians" expresses his ardent desire for the peaceful coexistence of brotherly nations. He describes how the heroes who once fought to the death and defeated the Persian invading army several times are now spending their remaining years. For many years, they have retired from the army and returned to their fields, burning charcoal for a living. Now, in times of war and chaos, the peasants are naturally the first to bear the brunt. They are bound to lose their heroic spirit and shed old tears in the play. This is an unpleasant laugh; this is a painful laugh. The sallow-faced Megarians, unable to make a living, brought their two young daughters to sell; they exchanged them for a handful of garlic and a tube of salt, and they were only sold by pretending to be piglets. This is a touching picture. The poet hopes that the urban industrial and commercial owners will see how poor the peasants are! What kind of disasters has the war brought to the people on both sides of the war! How big a crisis has it caused to the motherland!
    It is precisely this painful mood that turns into great joy when there is a glimmer of hope for peace. In 422 BC, Cleon of Athens and Brasidas of Sparta, the main warriors of the two opposing camps, died in battle one after another. The main obstacle to peace was removed. In order to celebrate the realization of the peace treaty, the poet staged his comedy "Peace" in the spring of the following year. The play is full of joyful feelings of escaping from the scourge of war. The Athenian peasants who have been suffering for many years are happily going to heaven to rescue the goddess of peace. They are jumping and shouting wildly, and nothing can stop them from shouting to their heart's content. They have suffered so much, so now they also have confidence in their own strength:
        "Once we have her, no one in the world will be able to
    take her away from us again. Good! Good!" They were united and finally rescued the goddess from the deep pit. We might as well listen to their joyous singing in the face of the goddess:
        "Welcome! Welcome! Welcome our beloved goddess! Seeing
    you come back, we are extremely happy. We have been eagerly looking forward
    to returning to our fields, but without you, we cannot go back, and we feel
    very sad in our hearts. Happiness is all given by you. We have missed the goddess of peace for a long time, and only you truly support the
    farmers. Once we have you in the world, we will have blessings to enjoy; you are
    the farmer's wheat cake and protector. Therefore, our vineyards,
    our vigorous fig groves, and our various gardens,
    smile and welcome you when they see you coming."
    Unfortunately, it was a flash in the pan, and the peace treaty was broken soon after. In 411 BC, the poet staged his "Lysistrata." This is the last comedy we have seen him write to strive for peace. Here, as in "Women in the Assembly," he expressed his progressive views on women's participation in politics. They are unwilling to go home unless their husbands put down their murder weapons. They won, and a happy life was restored. In the cheers, we heard the poet's mood of forcing a smile.
    Aristophanes' spirit of loving the motherland has been the same for decades. Whether it is teasing, satire, or whipping, whether it is shouting, praising, or reveling, it is all to save it from suffering, just like those peasants in the play, regardless of everything, to rescue the goddess of peace from the abyss. He did everything he could in his art. He pursued all kinds of artistic effects in order to arouse and awaken the people's self-awareness and sense of glory for the motherland. He is fascinating only to restore the rationality of his compatriots. In all the themes, he regards striving for peace as the biggest theme, using it again and again, and the technique always gives people a novel feeling. The civic task of striving for peace has become a profound source of inspiration for his creation, because he sees that this is related to the welfare of the vast people and the fate of Athens. He attacks a small number of people in order to save more people. He is so sensitive to politics, his heart beats with the times, and his imagination is so active that his performance is almost as fast as the event.
    In 404 BC, Athens had to surrender to Sparta. The empire collapsed, and in another seventy or eighty years, the Macedonian nation, which rose in the north, swept across the entire Greece. Our writer was not able to reverse the fate of the motherland, but his lofty aspirations and his great efforts made him a model for all poets and artists.
    Commemorating Aristophanes is not only to respect his outstanding contributions to world literature and dramatic art, but also to encourage the Greek people who are still living under bloody rule today. Aristophanes' tradition is the tradition of the people. In ancient times, he reflected the ardent desire of the people of his time for peaceful coexistence and a better life. He loves his motherland, just as each of us loves our own motherland. He wants his motherland to stand between heaven and earth, not to invade neighboring countries, nor to be invaded by neighboring countries. He was not able to see his wishes come true. Over the years, through several dynasties, the Greek people have followed one another, and to this day, they are still struggling for the cause of the liberation of the motherland. But history is progressing, and the people are no longer manipulated by others as in the past. The people have already become the masters of their own affairs in many countries, raising their heads and striding forward. The call for victory continues to be spread in a vast area.
    The World Peace Council's decision to commemorate Aristophanes, whether it is to remember the sages or to inspire future generations, is of great practical significance. (Attached picture)

专栏：

    阿里斯托芬——热爱祖国的伟大喜剧作家
    李健吾
    阿里斯托芬是古代希腊最伟大的喜剧作家，也是全世界最伟大的喜剧作家之一。他是雅典公民，生在公元前四四六年左右，死在公元前三八五年左右。他写了四十四部作品，传下来的作品虽然只有十一部，但是经过两千多年，照样虎虎有生气，并不因为年月久远，而有隔离之感。
    他承继民间喜剧传统，迅速反映时代，而又创造奇妙境界。没有语言可以点定他的喜剧特征。他的笔触忽而天，忽而地；忽而人神，忽而鸟兽；忽而隐喻，忽而明斥；忽而精致，忽而粗犷；忽而严肃，忽而轻松；东来一块，西来一块，好像是百衲衣，然而天衣无缝；风格千变万化，然而诗人的灵魂无所不在。情节虚拟，遇合离奇，然而行动细节真实，人物性格真实，语言闪烁跳荡，句句全有所指。现实和幻想在这里凝成完美的谐和的想像活动。走进他的喜剧世界，后人觉得目迷五色，好像到了一个从未来过的新园地，很难想到欧洲喜剧的花木是从这里滋生出来的。
    他不仅建立了喜剧的出奇制胜的活泼、自由的通俗的传统，而且是最早一个有强烈政治倾向的伟大作家。在他的喜剧杰作“蛙”里面，他最早指出文学的重大任务。他在全剧结束之前，在一般标准之外，提出一个最后也最有决定性的标准，就是诗人对祖国在政治上的贡献。“蛙”是一部富有戏剧性的喜剧作品。公元前四零六年，雅典两位大悲剧家欧里庇得斯和索福克勒斯先后去世。悲剧的护神狄俄倪索斯，感到很大的寂寞和悲痛。他决定要到阴曹把欧里庇得斯接回阳世来。经过了不少危险路程，他发现欧里庇得斯在阴间正同悲剧之父埃斯库罗斯争夺悲剧的宝座。他做了他们争论的仲裁人。狄俄倪索斯声明他要带优胜者转回阳世，而优胜的取决，却看他们“谁对国家出最有用的主意”。同时埃斯库罗斯质问欧里庇得斯，“一个诗人靠什么受人尊崇？”回答也是：“帮助国家教导人民”。就在埃斯库罗斯得到了胜利要走的时候，地府的主神赠别道：
        “那么，再会罢，埃斯库罗斯，你就欢欢
    喜喜上路罢。多出些好主意，救救你的老乡，
    想办法开导开导那些蠢才——那里有很多蠢
    才。”
    在阿里斯托芬看来，诗人首先必须是一位富有责任感的公民。戏剧不光为了消遣娱乐。诗人的任务就是“帮助国家教导人民”。由于阿里斯托芬这种勇于负责的正直、善良的愿望，在他的喜剧创作里面，像是不伦不类的东西，全在他的主观意图之下统一起来。这就是说，尖锐为了治病，上天下地为了救世，而目送手挥，海阔天空，为了放出更高的光辉。
    诗人热爱祖国，无论大事小事，不问是否关系个人，他全积极参预，作为自己的公民责任，通过丰盈多采的样式，或褒或贬，表示明确的态度。由于他对祖国的关怀，他的作品充满了战斗精神，在他的作品中他揭发贪污的文武官员，他斥责唯利是图的宵小。他爱祖国的荣誉过于一切，所以攻击危害祖国的各色人等，也就分外猛烈。战斗紧张到了短兵相接的程度。
    他晚年写的喜剧，虽然受到客观政治环境的压迫，不可能畅所欲言，但是，即使是在“公民大会妇女”和“财神”里面，我们看见诗人也不逃避现实，也没有丢开了政治和社会，不闻不问。“公民大会妇女”的写作动机，显然由于他为国事蜩螗而伤心。我们在这里看见一群一群妇女，穿戴丈夫衣帽，出其不意，把政权夺到了手。诗人鼓励不问外事的家庭妇女干预政治，因为“共和国的顾问一个坏似一个。他们中间偶尔有一个人做了一天好人，就有权一连做十天坏人”。混水摸鱼成了政客们的家常戏法。一个男子绝望之余就说：“把政权交给妇女罢，这是雅典还没有试过的唯一新办法”。诗人的讽刺只是为了：国家怎么样才能够走上正轨。他最后明白，想要彻底恢复安定，一定要从根本解决。对于一个战败的国家，再想强盛，首先应该建立经济基础。雅典穷了，雅典公民穷了，社会现象在这里自然而然就反映着国家复兴的基本问题。于是他写“财神”。在“财神”里面，他最先启发欧洲经济学者考虑贫富现象。他在“财神”里面提出以道德来做贫富的公平标准。自然，由于当时的经济条件太差，阿里斯托芬处在当时的历史局限性之下，他不可能解答他自己提出来的问题。
    他头一个把这样的问题提到了人类面前，也正好说明了他的喜剧艺术，活跃在怎样宽阔的现实的主题基础上面。
    而作品的主题能够密切结合国家的情况和人民的愿望，又是诗人深入生活的结果。他到实际生活里面领会政治。他的喜剧表现出了高度现实主义的艺术手法，并不停留在自然主义的素描上面。他之所以在艺术上能够达到这样高的成就，就因为他心里有一个为政治服务的总原则的缘故。他热爱生活，热爱理想，热爱祖国。
    他的另一部喜剧杰作“鸟”，表面好像凌空架设，实际也正牢牢建立在雅典人民的愿望上。两个雅典公民珀斯?泰洛斯和欧厄尔庇得斯，离开本土，访问戴胜鸟，希望找到一个国家，可以“痛痛快快睡个大觉，就像睡在大皮褥子上那么舒服”，因为他们是“反对陪审义务的公民”。他们向鸟类谈起它们的祖先，号令天下，神人慑伏，不像今天处处受到胁制。他们唤醒鸟类的荣誉观念，在半空建立了一个坚固的大城，截断神人之间的往来，帮助人类脱离灾难，成为人类真正的善邻好友。欺凌鸟类的天神投降了。雅典人纷纷来到“云中鹁鸪国”这块虚无缥缈的乐土，但是做了鸟国国王的珀斯?泰洛斯，却决不徇情地赶走了那些专务投机的诗人、预言家、历数家、视察员、逆子、舞蹈家、讼师等等。诗人明明白白告诉他的观众，想要雅典富强，应该驱除这些害群之马的败类。
    他在他另一部喜剧杰作“马蜂”里面，用足了气力唤醒他的同胞。“鸟”里面是两个“反对陪审义务的公民”，这里却是大批陪审员出现。年轻时候，他们都是保卫祖国的战士，现在上了年纪，他们抢着来做陪审员，因为做一天陪审员，有三个俄玻罗斯（货币名）好拿。做久了陪审员，他们养成马蜂的性格和习惯，因为他们发起狠来，都像马蜂一样；因为他们成群结队，到法庭做陪审员；因为他们千方百计敲诈兴讼的公民。诗人要他们爱惜过去的荣誉。他们应当特别感到难堪的是，陪审员中间很多人就没有拿过矛、撑过桨，为祖国流过一滴血汗。而这些曾经为祖国立过汗马功劳的老年人，如今贪图三个俄玻罗斯，就把荣誉出卖了。提高陪审员津贴，是当时的当权人物克勒翁收买人心的一种变相行贿的方法。老战士们自以为受之无愧，于是诗人就在“马蜂”里面，指出全部津贴的总和不到国家收入十分之一，此外十分之九进了口头上自称
  “我们决不出卖公众福利”的人们的腰包。他们拥护克勒翁，只是助纣为虐，做了他政治上投机的资本，成了他作恶的工具。
    早在“马蜂”上演之前，阿里斯托芬已经不断在他的喜剧里面攻击当权人物制革作坊坊主克勒翁。而最大最猛烈的集中一击，要算他的喜剧“骑士”。在别的喜剧里面，克勒翁仅仅通过人物的对话出现，到了“骑士”里面，他就以主要人物身分和观众正面相会了。上演这出喜剧的时候，正是克勒翁声威达到高峰的期间。诗人敢于这样做，需要无比的战斗勇气。在“马蜂”里面，合唱队说起了诗人的无畏的精神，指出道：
        “万一有什么人，看见他在戏里嘲笑他
    的爱人，生了气，跑过来对他抱怨，他全不放
    在心上，因为他只有一个正直的动机；他的文
    艺女神不是鸨子。自从他开始他的戏剧事业以
    来，他就不屑于和常人斤斤较量，而是鼓起古
    代英雄的勇气，专打穷凶极恶的妖怪……”但是这时候正是这“妖怪”炙手可热的时候，没有一个演员敢于应命扮演。也没有一个面具匠肯做一副克勒翁的面具给演员戴。诗人并不知难而退。他自己抹了脸扮演克勒翁这个角色。
    克勒翁在戏里是昏庸老朽的德谟斯（平民）宠信的仆人。仗着花言巧语，他得到公民大会的盲目信任，“阔人怕他，穷人见了他直打哆嗦”。他不但不真心诚意帮德谟斯作事，反而一点也不怜惜，把他幽闭了八年，拿烟薰坏了他的眼睛；他撕毁了斯巴达的和约，建议停战的使节也被他一脚踢出了城门。诗人在戏里给他找了一个竞争的敌手腊肠贩。腊肠贩在对驳里面揭发他的隐私道：“你不拿雅典在阿耳卡狄亚的统治搁在心上；你关怀的只是抢掠盟邦，逼它们拿出更多的捐献。你赞成战争，为了混水摸鱼，掩蔽你在暗地做的坏事，而人民走头无路，只好向你伸手”。腊肠贩终于打败了克勒翁，把克勒翁贬到街头，卖腊肠给外国人吃，“因为他从前随随便便就侮辱他们”。
    我们可以看出，诗人放手攻击声势煊赫的克勒翁，主要就是为了他和他的战争集团给雅典带来了无衣无食的灾害。他们派遣海军出国，为了大规模进行经济掠取。从前曾经协力御侮的希腊兄弟民族，由于他们的巧取豪夺，如今变成了冤冤相报的仇敌。历史证明阿里斯托芬为希腊各城邦和平共处所做的多年斗争，符合人民的愿望，属于正义的行动。
    但是，他并不反对一切战争。他常常借重合唱队，歌颂马拉松和萨拉弥斯战役。祖先曾经以少胜多，在全希腊存亡关头，打败声势浩大的波斯远征军队。这是为祖国而战，这是反侵略的光荣战役。而作坊坊主之流主持的战争，只给祖国带来了贫困、骚乱和羞辱。雅典已经忘记了：当年打退波斯侵略，是希腊兄弟民族同心协力、并肩作战的结果。胜利换来了雅典的兴盛。而今却像有了不共戴天之仇，彼此摩拳擦掌，自相厮杀起来。阿里斯托芬热爱祖国，因为祖国从前有一时期曾经是兄弟民族和平共处的好榜样，因为它曾经领导它们，九死一生，打退了共同的敌人。
    流传下来的他的最早的喜剧杰作“阿卡奈人”里面就说出了他对兄弟民族和平共处的热烈愿望。他描写那些曾经出生入死、几次打退波斯侵略大军的英雄好汉，如今在怎样渡过他们的余生呢？多年来他们解甲归田，烧炭为生，现在兵荒马乱，如斯巴达陆军来攻，农民自然首当其冲。他们在戏里也势必要英雄气短，老泪横流。这是不愉快的笑；这是痛心的笑。面黄肌瘦的墨伽拉人，无以为生，带着两个小女儿出卖；她们给他换到一把蒜头和一筒盐，而且还是假装成了小猪，才卖掉了的。这是感动人的画面。诗人希望城里工商业主看看农民苦到什么程度！战争给交战双方的人民带来了什么样的灾害！给祖国招致了多大的危机！
    正是这种沉痛心情，遇到和平有了一线希望的时候，就会变成莫大的喜悦。公元前四二二年，两个敌对营垒的主战人物、雅典的克勒翁和斯巴达的布剌西达斯，先后死在战场。和平的主要障碍扫除了。诗人为了预祝和约实现，就在第二年春天，上演他的喜剧“和平”。戏里充满了脱离战祸的欢乐情调。多年困苦的雅典农民们，欢天喜地地上天堂营救和平女神，他们狂蹦乱跳，什么也挡不住他们尽情叫喊。他们受尽了苦，所以现在对自己的力量也有了信心：
        “我们一有了她，世上就别想有谁能够拿
    她再从我们这里抢走。好啊！好啊！”他们万众一心，终于把女神从深坑里头救了出来。我们不妨听听他们面对女神的欢唱：
        “欢迎！欢迎！欢迎我们敬爱的女神！看
    见您回来，我们欢喜极了。我们一直热切盼望
    回到我们的田野，可是没有了您，我们就回不
    去，心里甭提要多难过。幸福全是您给的。我
    们想念了许久的和平女神，只有您真正支持庄
    稼人。世上一有了您，我们就有福好享；您就
    是农民的麦饼和护卫。所以，我们的葡萄园、
    我们茁壮的无花果树林子和我们各色的田园，
    一见您来，就喜笑颜开，欣然欢迎。”
    不幸是昙花一现，和约不久就又破坏了。公元前四一一年，诗人上演他的“吕西斯特剌?”。这是我们见到的他写的末一个争取和平的喜剧。他在这里和在“公民大会妇女”里面一样，发表了他对妇女参政的进步见解。她们不肯回家，除非她们的丈夫放下杀人凶器。她们胜利了，幸福生活恢复了。在欢呼声里，我们听出了诗人强作欢笑的心情。
    阿里斯托芬热爱祖国的精神，几十年如一日，无论揶揄、讽刺或者鞭挞，无论呼喊、歌颂或者狂欢，都是为了把它从苦难中救出来，就像戏里那些农民，不顾一切，要把和平女神从万丈深坑救出来一样。他尽了他艺术上可能尽的一切心力。他追寻各种各样的艺术效能，为了激起、唤起人民的自觉心和对祖国的光荣感。他引人入胜，只是为了恢复同胞的理智。在所有主题里面，他把争取和平看做最大的主题，三番四次使用，手法上也永远给人以一种新颖的感觉。争取和平的公民任务成了他创作上深厚的灵感泉源，因为他看出这关系着广大人民的福利和雅典的命运。他攻击一小撮人，为了救出更多的人。他对政治那样敏感，心随着时代一同跳动，而想像又那样活跃，表现几乎和事件一般快速。
    公元前四零四年，雅典不得不向斯巴达投降。帝国崩溃了，再过七八十年，崛起北方的马其顿民族席卷了全希腊。我们的作家没有能够挽回祖国的劫运，但是他的崇高的心愿和他的伟大的努力，却使他成为一切诗人和艺术家的楷模。
    纪念阿里斯托芬，不光为了敬重他对世界文学和戏剧艺术的卓越贡献，也为了鼓舞今天依然活在血腥统治之下的希腊人民。阿里斯托芬的传统是人民的传统。他在古代反映了同代人民对于和平共处与美好生活的热烈愿望。他热爱他的祖国，也正如同我们每一个人热爱自己的祖国一样。他愿意他的祖国挺立于天地之间，不侵略邻邦，也不受邻邦侵略。他没有能够看见他的心愿成为事实。岁月悠悠，几经朝代，希腊人民前仆后继，直到今天，还在为祖国的解放事业艰苦奋斗。但是历史进展着，人民不像已往那样由人摆布了。人民已经在许多国家当家作主，抬起了头，大步向前迈进。胜利的号召不断在广大地域传了出来。
    世界和平理事会决定纪念阿里斯托芬，无论是追念先贤，或者激励后人，都是有很大的现实意义的。（附图片）
