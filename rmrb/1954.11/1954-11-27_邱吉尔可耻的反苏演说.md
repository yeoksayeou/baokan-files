　　Churchill's Shameful Anti-Soviet Speech
　　[Xinhua News Agency, London, November 25th] TASS London, November 25th: Speaking to voters in his constituency (Woodford) on the 23rd, Prime Minister Churchill said: "Even before the end of the war, when hundreds of thousands of Germans were surrendering to us and our streets were filled with joyful crowds, I had already telegraphed Montgomery, instructing him to carefully collect German weapons and store them away, so that if the Soviet Union continued to advance, it would be very convenient to reissue these weapons to the German soldiers with whom we would have to cooperate."
　　Reuters pointed out that when Churchill said this, someone in the audience shouted: "Shameful!"
　　Churchill said: "Our policy is to seek peace through strength." According to Churchill, the London and Paris Agreements "are improved in many ways compared to the European Defense Community."
　　[Xinhua News Agency, London, November 26th] London Dispatch: Churchill's anti-Soviet speech on the 23rd has caused a great uproar in Britain. In this speech, Churchill stated that even before the end of World War II, he was prepared to return weapons to Hitler's troops to fight against the Soviet Union.
　　Labor MPs have attacked Churchill en masse. Hughes said that after Churchill admitted this, "everyone wants to know what we fought the last war for." Plummer said: "This shockingly shows that he did not have any discussions with his colleagues before ordering those officers and soldiers whom he had always called murderers to be rearmed in order to prevent Russia from achieving victory." Dribble said: "This matter shockingly reveals that Churchill's words about the camaraderie and loyalty of all allied comrades at the end of the war were completely insincere."
　　Labor MPs Lipton and others have already raised questions in Parliament about Churchill's statement.
　　Newspapers pointed out that Churchill would be severely criticized by Labor MPs at the next session of Parliament on November 30th.
　　The "Workers' Daily" editorial pointed out: "In the history of alliances, there has never been such a perfidious act against an ally… This speech should be the final piece of evidence proving that rearming Germany means war, and it is for the purpose of launching war."
　　The bourgeois press criticized Churchill's remarks as untimely. The "Times" editorial said that Churchill seemed to indicate the possibility of employing people directly from Hitler's army, "This idea was unrealistic at the time, and it is unwise to talk about it now." The Liberal Party's "News Chronicle" said, "It is imprudent to make such a public disclosure now." The Labor Party's "Daily Herald" believes that Churchill's "shocking leak of secrets" is very untimely.

    邱吉尔可耻的反苏演说
   【新华社二十六日讯】塔斯社伦敦二十五日讯：邱吉尔首相二十三日向他的选区（伍德佛）的选民们发表演说时说：“甚至在战争结束以前，在数以十万计的德国人向我们投降、我们的街道上挤满了欢乐的人群的时候，我就已经打电报给蒙哥马利，指示他仔细收集德国人的武器，把他们收藏起来，这样，如果苏联继续前进的话，就可以很方便地把这批武器重新发给我们必须与之合作的德国士兵。”
    报联社指出，当邱吉尔说这一段话的时候，听众中有人喊：“可耻！”
    邱吉尔说：“我们的政策是以实力求和平。”据邱吉尔说，伦敦和巴黎协定“在许多方面都比欧洲防务集团有改进”。
   【新华社二十六日讯】伦敦消息：邱吉尔二十三日的反苏演说在英国引起了轩然大波。邱吉尔在这篇演说里曾经声明，他甚至在第二次世界大战结束以前就准备把武器交还给希特勒军队来反对苏联。
    工党议员群起攻击邱吉尔。休斯说，在邱吉尔承认了这件事以后，“每个人都希望知道我们进行上次大战到底是为了什么”。普鲁麦说：“这惊人地表明：他没有同他的同僚们进行任何讨论，就下令把他一直称为杀人犯的那些军官和士兵重新武装起来，以便阻止俄国取得胜利。”德里柏说：“这件事惊人地透露了邱吉尔在战争结束时谈到关于所有盟国的战友之谊和忠诚的那些话完全是不真诚的。”
    工党议员李普顿等人已经就邱吉尔这种声明向议会提出质询。
    报纸指出：在十一月三十日议会下届会议中，邱吉尔会遭到工党议员们的猛烈抨击。
    “工人日报”的社论指出：“在结盟的历史上，从来不曾有过对盟国这样背信弃义的行为……这篇演说应该成为最后的一件证据，证明重新武装德国意味着战争，而且是为了发动战争。”
    资产阶级的报纸批评邱吉尔的这番话不合时宜。“泰晤士报”的社论说，邱吉尔似乎表示有可能起用那些直接从希特勒军队里出来的人，“这种主意在当时是不现实的，而在现在讲出来是不聪明的”。自由党的“新闻纪事报”说，“现在作这种公开透露是不慎重的。”工党的“每日先驱报”认为邱吉尔“惊人地泄露秘密”是很不合时宜的。
