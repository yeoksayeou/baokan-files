    Fushun Coalfield Boundary Expanded

    In the eastern part of the Fushun Coalfield, the northernmost row of drilling rigs on the south bank of the Hun River has continuously discovered coal seams, further expanding the boundary of the coalfield.

    This row of drilling rigs has a total of nine drill holes. On September 22nd, coal was found in Hole No. 391, and the coal seam was more than 14 meters thick. On September 30th, coal was also discovered in Hole No. 166, and by the end of October, it had drilled more than 8 meters into the coal seam. On October 27th, coal was found in drill hole No. 104. Good news of coal being found also came from drill hole No. 190 on the morning of October 29th. The coal discovered by each drilling rig formed a line, completely connected to the coal of the main layer of the Fushun Coalfield.

    The newly discovered coalfield is about 7,000 meters long and about 200 to 400 meters wide. Preliminary calculations show that the coal reserves can supply the Longfeng and Laohutai mines for eight years of underground mining.

    抚顺煤田境界扩大
    抚顺煤田东部，在浑河南岸最北的一排钻塔，连续发现了煤层，再次扩大了煤田的境界。
    这排钻塔共有九个钻孔，九月二十二日，三九一号孔见煤了，煤层有十四公尺多厚。九月三十日，一六六号孔又发现了煤，到十月底已在煤层中钻进八公尺多。十月二十七日一零四号钻孔见了煤。一九零号钻孔在十月二十九日早晨也传出了见煤的喜报。各钻机发现的煤连成了一线，和抚顺煤田的本层煤整个接连在一起。
    新发现的煤田长约七千公尺，宽约二百到四百公尺，初步计算煤的埋藏量可供龙凤、老虎台矿井下采掘八年。
