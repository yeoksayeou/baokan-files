    Strengthening Political and Ideological Work in Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives
    Ma Tieding
    Since the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued its resolution on the development of agricultural producers' cooperatives, and after the general line propaganda of last winter and this spring, and the implementation and thorough application of the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement has made tremendous progress. The number of agricultural producers' cooperatives has increased from more than 14,000 last year to more than 200,000 at present. In the future, agricultural producers' cooperatives will develop even more and gradually become the main form of agricultural production. Under these circumstances, the issue of strengthening political and ideological work in agricultural producers' cooperatives has particular significance and has become a central link in further strengthening rural political work. Over the past few years, especially since the propaganda of the general line, political and ideological work in agricultural producers' cooperatives has been making continuous progress and has achieved some success, but it still lags far behind the requirements of the development of the objective situation.

    With the progress of the socialist transformation of agriculture and the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, rural class struggle, whether political, economic, or ideological, is not weakening but becoming more acute. The contradictions between cooperation and the individual economy, between the planned economy and the free market, between individual interests and overall interests, between immediate interests and long-term interests, and between socialist ideology and capitalist ideology, exist in the vast rural areas and are inevitably reflected in the internal affairs of the cooperatives. The sabotage activities of counter-revolutionaries and rich peasants further complicate this struggle and these contradictions.

    Although most of the peasants who have joined the cooperatives are enthusiastic about production and determined to take the socialist road, treating the cooperatives as their own homes, some peasants have joined the cooperatives with unclear purposes or with various different motives. Some cooperatives, due to stronger leadership and more experience in running the cooperative, may have fewer problems; others, due to weaker leadership, may have more problems. However, in all types of cooperatives, there are many ideological problems that farmers have when they join the cooperative and after they join the cooperative, which need to be constantly studied and gradually resolved, and these are largely consistent. For example, some fear being called backward and join the cooperative "following the crowd," saying things like "Everyone is on the boat, let's get on too, how else can we cross the river?" Some hold the attitude of "try it and see, if it's not good, we'll quit the cooperative," and are very wavering. Some households with more land and less labor are afraid of not being able to hire workers if they don't join the cooperative. Some households with less land and more labor want to earn more workdays by joining the cooperative. There are also individual reactionaries and rich peasants who infiltrate the cooperative with the intention of sabotage. After joining the cooperative, the individual peasants' selfish and undisciplined habits still generally exist, reflected in daily labor, with frequent quarrels over work assignment and workpoint recording, preferring to do easy and effortless work, and not obeying unified distribution; they are not concerned about the collective interests and public property of the cooperative, and even harm the public for personal gain; in some cooperatives, there is not enough unity between new and old members and between middle and poor peasant members; some members of individual cooperatives engage in commercial speculation, black market trading, and disguised labor exploitation within the cooperative. All of this creates an extremely complex ideological situation within the cooperative. But the leadership had foreseen this situation long ago. We know that it is impossible for individual peasants to quickly become selfless collectivists when they first join the cooperative; it is not surprising that many of them enter the cooperative with their own small plans. It is also certain that capitalist ideology will influence them. The question is how to strengthen their education and gradually raise their political consciousness.

    At present, political and ideological work in agricultural producers' cooperatives is weak or relatively weak. This is partly due to a lack of experience and partly because party organizations in some areas have not universally attached importance to this work. Some people hold the attitude that "once the cooperative is established, everything is fine," saying, "The members all know that socialism is happiness, and I don't see any concerns," "The principles have been explained almost enough, there won't be any problems." This statement is clearly not in line with the actual situation in the countryside. The actual situation is not that there are no problems, but that there are many problems; the peasants do not have no concerns, but many peasants, especially middle peasants and well-to-do middle peasants, have great concerns; the principles are not explained "almost enough," but are far from enough. Some propaganda cadres have participated in the actual work of agricultural producers' cooperatives, which is a good thing and will greatly help to improve propaganda work, but unfortunately, they have not consciously studied and accumulated experience in strengthening political work within the cooperative. The above reflects that some comrades do not sufficiently understand the importance of the Party's political and ideological work.

    The establishment and development of cooperatives is indeed an achievement that should not be underestimated. But facts have proved that it is not as simple as "everything will be fine." It must be understood that after the cooperative is established, it can develop in the direction of socialism or in the direction of capitalism. If we strengthen the Party's leadership, strengthen the Party's political and ideological work, and constantly guide the peasants in the direction of socialism, then it will develop in the direction of socialism, using the cooperative to drive the mutual aid groups and individual farmers, and the socialist transformation of the entire countryside will be able to proceed smoothly. Conversely, the cooperative can also develop in the direction of capitalism. If socialism does not occupy the ideological front in the minds of the vast number of peasants, then capitalist ideology will inevitably strengthen its position. This is true in the case of individual farmers and mutual aid groups, and it is also true in the case of agricultural producers' cooperatives. And in fact, this is exactly the case. In some areas, due to the relaxation of the Party's leadership and the relaxation of the Party's political and ideological work, the capitalist influence in the agricultural producers' cooperatives there has indeed increased. The agricultural producers' cooperatives there are not interested in agricultural production, but put their main efforts into sideline occupations and commerce, and even engage in commercial speculation; there is disguised exploitation of poor peasants within the cooperative; and the grain produced is refused to be sold to the state, attempting to wait for a better price. If this is allowed to develop, what kind of nature will such a production cooperative be, is it not clear? Some cooperatives have developed in production, and the income of the peasants has also increased, but this has not become a factor in strengthening and consolidating the cooperative; instead, the more the members are prosperous, the more they want to get rich individually. The development of production has become a condition that endangers the cooperative with disintegration and collapse. Ignoring or neglecting the Party's political and ideological work in the cooperative has already and will inevitably have serious consequences, is there anything to doubt? Agricultural producers' cooperatives are examples for mutual aid groups and individual farmers, and everyone is watching them. Their success or failure, good or bad, is obviously not only a matter for the cooperative itself, but a matter for the direction of development of the entire rural work. Some people say, "No matter what, political work is not as important as growing more grain." Growing more grain and developing production are certainly important. However, without political work to ensure economic work, it is also difficult to grow more grain and develop production. Even if production can be developed, it is not guaranteed that the cooperative can be consolidated, as the previous example has shown. Economic work and political work are the two rings to gradually realize the socialist transformation of agriculture, and lacking or relaxing either side will lead to losses in the work. The resolution of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on the development of agricultural producers' cooperatives points out: "Closely integrate the Party's political work with economic work in order to gradually realize the socialist transformation of agriculture." Here, the importance of political work in agricultural producers' cooperatives has been made very clear. So, what are the main tasks of the Party's political and ideological work in production cooperatives?

    This is to constantly educate the members with socialism and collectivism, gradually overcome the individualism of the members, and pay special attention to overcoming the capitalist ideological tendencies that grow at any time among the members, such as collective concealment of output, resistance to unified purchase and sale, speculation and profiteering, tax evasion and other violations of the articles of association. It is necessary to encourage agricultural producers' cooperatives to provide socialist assistance to mutual aid groups and individual farmers. It is necessary to establish and strengthen the exchange of experience and mutual assistance between agricultural producers' cooperatives, between cooperatives and mutual aid groups, and between cooperatives and individual farmers. It is necessary to ensure that labor competition is carried out regularly and persistently to improve the members' socialist consciousness in labor, cherish public property, abide by labor discipline, oppose selfishness and laziness, and oppose the phenomenon of no one being responsible.

    In the mutual aid and cooperation movement, especially in the political and ideological work of agricultural producers' cooperatives, our experience is insufficient. However, this does not mean that we have no experience or no way to do it; we still have some experience, although it is not yet mature, and many fragmented and piecemeal experiences have not yet been well collected and summarized, and this is precisely what we need to strengthen, because the experience and methods themselves are originally created and gradually accumulated.

    Some areas have proposed that political and ideological education for members is a long-term and arduous task for rural party organizations, and first of all, it is necessary to educate party members so that they understand the importance of political and ideological work, understand the relationship between political and ideological work and the development of production, and that party members have the obligation to carry out propaganda work. In order to strengthen political work in cooperatives, some areas have stipulated that among the main leading cadres in the cooperative's management committee, at least one party cadre should be in charge of or concurrently manage political and ideological work. Some areas have already established propaganda team within the cooperative. Experience has shown that there are many benefits to establishing such a propaganda team: the Party can learn and collect the ideological situation of the masses in a timely manner through the propagandists, and the Party will have more conditions and possibilities to combine the specific thoughts of the members and educate them through the propagandists; the Party can also carry out publicity on the superiority of organizing through the Party's propagandists to mutual aid groups and individual farmers, as well as other publicity, so as to drive the entire rural political and ideological work to be carried out regularly and constantly consolidate and strengthen the socialist ideological front. Some areas have proposed to be good at grasping all possible opportunities for education. For example, when developing new members, when distributing dividends, and when carrying out production competitions and appraising production results, the thoughts of the masses are most easily exposed at this time, and it is easier to achieve results by educating them. Naturally, it is not enough to rely solely on meetings for education, and meetings should not be held too many or too long. More importantly, it is necessary to conduct different education based on different occasions and different objects in daily labor, life contact, and individual conversations. In particular, the exemplary role of party members and Youth League members, being selfless, is a most realistic education for ordinary members. Therefore, it is necessary to educate party members to resolutely implement the Party's policies and branch resolutions, modelly abide by the articles of association, implement production plans, unite members, cultivate activists, and strive to complete production plans and support socialist industrialization. While educating the members, various undesirable tendencies should be constantly overcome within the party and party members' education of the members should be regularly checked. All of these can be flexibly applied by various localities according to their specific conditions.

    To strengthen political work in agricultural producers' cooperatives, the key issue lies in the specific leadership of the Party's county committees and district committees over political and ideological work. At present, the majority of township and village cadres have to directly participate in production, and their tasks are busy; on the other hand, they are limited by their political and cultural level, and it is difficult for them to independently carry out political and ideological work among the peasants, and they urgently need the specific help and guidance of the county and district; this request is reasonable, and the county and district should satisfy this request as much as possible. The county and district should at least be able to and should do the following: First, when deploying various specific tasks, especially central tasks, deploy political and ideological work at the same time, because any matter directly related to the vital interests of the broad masses is difficult to implement without fairly mature political and ideological mobilization. Without sufficient persuasive education, coercion will inevitably occur; second, the Party's county and district committees should discuss the major issues in political and ideological work. It is true that our tasks are very heavy, and there are many things that need to be discussed and studied at the Party committee, but political and ideological work should occupy a certain position, and ignoring this aspect of work is wrong; third, strengthen the regular supervision and inspection of political and ideological work. Only through regular supervision and inspection can we truly achieve specific assistance and timely solve the difficulties that occur in the work. Naturally, the county's propaganda department and the district's propaganda and education committee should actively cooperate with the progress of various tasks and strive for the supervision and leadership of the Party committee. The Party committees at the county and district levels and above should also pay attention to summarizing and exchanging the experiences of political work in agricultural producers' cooperatives in various places, and give specific guidance to the lower levels.

    The mutual aid and cooperation movement in rural areas has made great progress and will make even greater progress. The Party's political and ideological work must correspondingly catch up in order to continuously consolidate and expand the socialist ideological front in the countryside in order to meet the new upsurge of the mutual aid and cooperation movement.

    加强农业生产合作社中的政治思想工作
    马铁丁
    自中共中央关于发展农业生产合作社的决议发布以后，经过去冬今春的总路线宣传，粮食统购统销政策的执行和贯彻，农村互助合作运动已经有了巨大的发展。农业生产合作社已由去年的一万四千多个增加到目前的二十多万个。今后农业生产合作社将会有更大的发展，它将逐渐成为农业生产中的主要形式。在这种情形下，加强农业生产合作社中的政治思想工作的问题，就有特别重要的意义；并成为进一步加强农村政治工作的一个中心环节。过去几年来、特别是宣传总路线以来，农业生产合作社中的政治思想工作是在不断进步中，并且已经取得了一些成绩，但是，依然远远赶不上客观形势的发展要求。
    随着农业社会主义改造的进行，互助合作运动的发展，农村阶级斗争，不论是政治的、经济的、还是思想的斗争，都不是削弱，而是更加尖锐了。合作化和个体经济的矛盾，计划经济和自由市场的矛盾，个人利益和整体利益的矛盾，目前利益和长远利益的矛盾，社会主义思想和资本主义思想的矛盾，在广大农村中存在着，也必然反映到合作社的内部中来。加上反革命分子、富农分子的破坏活动，更使这种斗争和矛盾复杂化。
    在已参加合作社的农民中虽然大部分生产积极，决心走社会主义的路，把合作社当自己的家。但也有一部分农民参加社的目的性本来就不明确，或者怀着各种不同的动机。有的社，由于领导骨干较强，对于办社有较多的经验，社内所存在的问题，可能比较少些；有的由于领导较弱，存在的问题可能多一些。但是，不论在那种类型的社里，农民入社时以及入社后，有许多思想问题，需要经常研究并加以逐步解决，却是大体一致的。例如有怕别人说落后，“随大流”进社的，说什么“大家都上船啦，咱也上吧，那能淌过河呢”，有的抱着“试试看，不好就退社”的态度，动摇性很大；有些地多劳力少的户，因为怕不入社就雇不到工；有些地少劳力多的户，为了入社能多挣劳动日；也有个别反动分子、富农钻进社里蓄意进行破坏。入社后，个体农民的自私散漫等思想习惯依然普遍存在，反映在日常劳动中，经常为了分工记工发生争吵，喜欢拣省力、易做的活做，不服从统一分配；对社内集体利益、公共财物不关心，甚至损公利己；有的社新老社员及中贫农社员之间，还存在不够团结的现象；个别社的社员有进行商业投机、黑市买卖，在社内进行变相的劳动剥削的。所有这些，就造成了合作社内部极端复杂的思想情况。但这种情况是领导方面早就预见到了的。我们知道，个体农民初加入到合作社里来，要他们很快变为毫无自私打算的集体主义者是不可能的，他们中的许多人怀有各个人的小打算走进社来，本来并不奇怪。资本主义思想会对他们发生影响，也是肯定的。问题在于如何加强对他们的教育，逐步提高他们的政治觉悟。
    目前农业生产合作社的政治思想工作是薄弱的，或比较薄弱的。这一方面由于经验不足，一方面由于某些地区的党组织还没有把这一工作普遍地重视起来。有的人抱着“建社完毕，万事大吉”的态度，他们说：“社员都知道社会主义是幸福的，看不出有什么顾虑”，“道理已经讲得差不多了，不会有问题”，这种说法显然是不符合农村实际情况的。实际情况不是没有问题，而是问题很多；农民不是没有顾虑，而是有许多农民，特别是中农、富裕中农顾虑很大；道理不是讲得“差不多”，而是差得多。有一些宣传干部参加了生产合作社的实际工作，这本是好事情，对改进宣传工作将大有作用，可惜他们没有有意识地从中研究和积累加强社内政治工作的经验。上述这些反映了有些同志对党的政治思想工作的重要性是认识不足的。
    合作社建立起来了，发展了，这诚然是不应低估的成绩。但事实证明，并不是就可以“万事大吉”了。必须懂得合作社建立之后，可以向社会主义的方向发展，也可以向资本主义的方向发展。如果加强党的领导，加强党的政治思想工作，不断地把农民向社会主义方向引导，那么，它就会向社会主义方向发展，用社带动互助组，带动单干农民，整个农村的社会主义改造工作也就能够顺利进行。反之，合作社也可以向资本主义方向发展的。在广大农民思想中，社会主义不去占领阵地，客观上也就必然加强资本主义的思想阵地。在单干农民和互助组中是这样，在生产合作社中也是这样。而事实上也正是这样。有些地区由于放松了党的领导，放松了党的政治思想工作，那里的农业生产合作社中的资本主义影响果然就增强起来。那里的农业生产合作社对农业生产并无兴趣，而把主要的力量放在副业和商业方面，甚至进行商业投机；社内存在着变相的对贫苦农民的剥削；生产的粮食拒绝卖给国家，企图待价而估。如果任其发展下去，这样的生产合作社将是何种性质，难道还不明白吗？有的合作社生产上虽然发展了，农民的收入也增加了，但是这并没有成为加强和巩固合作社的因素，而是社员越是各自富裕，越是各自想个人发财。生产发展反而成为使合作社有拆台、散伙危险的条件。忽视或轻视党在合作社里的政治思想工作，已经而且必然发生严重的后果，难道还有什么可以怀疑的吗？农业生产合作社是互助组、单干农民的榜样，大家眼睛看着它。它的成败、好坏显然不仅是合作社本身的问题，而是整个农村工作发展方向的问题。有的人说：“政治工作无论如何，总没有多打粮食重 要”。多打粮食，发展生产，当然是重要的。但是，经济工作没有政治工作来保证，要多打粮食，发展生产也是困难的。即使能够发展生产，也保不定合作社能够巩固，前面已有例子说明了这点。经济工作和政治工作是逐步实现农业社会主义改造的双环，缺少或放松那一面，都会招致工作上的损失。中共中央关于发展农业生产合作社的决议中指出：“把党的政治工作和经济工作密切地结合起来，以便逐步实现农业的社会主义改造”。这里已把农业生产合作社中的政治工作的重要性讲得很清楚。那么，党在生产合作社中政治思想工作的主要任务是什么呢？
    这就是必须经常地以社会主义与集体主义教育社员，逐步克服社员的个人主义，特别要注意克服社员中随时滋长的资本主义思想倾向，例如集体隐瞒产量，抵抗统购统销，进行投机买卖，偷漏税收以及其他违犯章程的行为。必须鼓励农业生产合作社对互助组和单干农民的社会主义的帮助。必须建立和加强各个农业生产合作社之间，社与互助组、单干农民之间交流经验和互相帮助的关系。要保障劳动竞赛的经常持久地进行，以提高社员在劳动中的社会主义自觉，爱护公共财产，遵守劳动纪律，反对自私懒惰，反对无人负责现象。
    在互助合作运动中间，特别是农业生产合作社中的政治思想工作，我们的经验是不足的。但是，这并不是说我们毫无经验，毫无办法，我们还是有些经验的，虽然它还不成熟，许多片断、零星的经验还没有很好地集中起来进行总结，而这正有待于我们加强这方面的工作，因为经验办法的本身，本来也就是创造和逐步积累起来的。
    有的地区提出，对社员的政治思想教育是农村党组织长期的艰巨的任务，首先必须教育党员，使党员懂得政治思想工作的重要，懂得政治思想工作和发展生产的关系，党员有进行宣传工作的义务。为了加强合作社中的政治工作，有的地区已规定合作社的社务管理委员会中，主要领导干部中至少有一个党员干部专管或兼管政治思想工作。有的地区已经在合作社内建立宣传员小组。经验证明，建立这种宣传员小组有不少好处：党可以通过宣传员及时了解和收集群众的思想情况，党也就有更多的条件和可能结合社员的具体思想并通过宣传员向社员进行教育；党还可以通过党的宣传员向互助组、单干农民进行组织起来优越性的宣传以及其他宣传，从而带动整个农村的政治思想工作能够经常进行，不断地巩固和加强社会主义思想阵地。有的地区提出要善于掌握一切可能进行教育的机会。例如在发展新的社员的时候，分红的时候，开展生产竞赛、评比生产成绩的时候，在这种时候，群众的思想最易暴露，向他们进行教育，也较易收到效果。自然，单靠会议进行教育是很不够的，而且会议也不宜开得太多太长。更重要的还必须在日常的劳动中，生活接触中，个别交谈中，根据不同的场合，不同的对象进行不同的教育。特别是党员、团员的模范作用，大公无私，对于一般社员就是一个最现实的教育。因此，要教育党员坚决执行党的政策和支部决议，模范地遵守社章，执行生产计划，团结社员，培养积极分子，为完成生产计划，支援社会主义工业化而斗争。在向社员进行教育的同时，在党内应不断克服各种不良倾向和经常检查党员对社员的教育情况。所有这些各地都可根据自己的具体条件，灵活运用。
    加强农业生产合作社中的政治工作，关键问题在于党的县委会、区委会对政治思想工作的具体领导。目前，乡、村干部一方面多数要直接参加生产，任务繁忙；另一方面也受政治水平、文化水平的限制，要他们独立自主地向农民进行政治思想工作是有困难的，他们迫切需要县、区的具体帮助和引导；这个要求是合理的，县、区方面应该尽可能满足这个要求。县、区方面至少可以而且应该做到：第一和布置各项具体工作，特别是中心工作的同时，布置政治思想工作，因为任何一件和广大群众切身利益直接有关的事情，没有相当成熟的政治思想动员，都是难以行得通的。不进行充分的说服教育工作，必然产生强迫命令；第二、政治思想工作中的重大问题，党的县委会、区委会应该加以讨论。不错，我们的任务是十分繁重的，需要在党委会讨论研究的事情是很多的，但政治思想工作应占有一定的位置，无视这方面的工作是不对的；第三、加强对政治思想工作经常的督促和检查。只有经常的督促检查，才能真正做到具体帮助，及时地解决工作中所发生的困难。自然，县的宣传部门，区的宣教委员应该主动地配合各项工作的进行，争取党委会的监督和领导。县、区以上的各级党委也应注意总结和交流各地农业生产合作社政治工作的经验，给下面以具体指导。
    农村中的互助合作运动已经有了很大的发展，而且将有更大的发展。党的政治思想工作必须相应地迎头赶上，以便不断地巩固和扩大在农村中的社会主义思想阵地，以迎接互助合作运动的新的高潮。
