Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 8th: TASS reported from Moscow on the 8th that on November 7th, the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs delivered a note to the U.S. Embassy in the Soviet Union, protesting the outrageous act of U.S. military aircraft intruding into Soviet airspace.

The note stated: According to established facts, on November 7th of this year, at 13:20 Tanfilyev Island time (12:41 Vladivostok time), a B-29 type four-engine military aircraft bearing U.S. Air Force markings violated the Soviet border in the area of Tanfilyev Island (in the Kuril Islands), and continued to intrude into Soviet airspace in the direction of the island. As this U.S. aircraft flew over Tanfilyev Island, two Soviet fighter planes approached, intending to point out to the aircraft that it was in Soviet territory and demand that it immediately leave Soviet airspace. As the Soviet fighter planes approached, the U.S. aircraft opened fire on them. In view of this unwarranted action by the U.S. intruders, the Soviet aircraft had no choice but to return fire, after which the U.S. aircraft flew out of Soviet airspace, heading southwest.

The Soviet government lodges a strong protest with the U.S. government against the outrageous act of a U.S. military aircraft rudely violating the Soviet border.

The note pointed out: This is yet another instance of a U.S. aircraft intruding into Soviet territory. The Soviet government has previously called the U.S. government's attention to similar violations.

The Soviet government considers that taking measures to prevent the recurrence of U.S. aircraft intruding into Soviet territory is in the interests of both the Soviet Union and the United States, and the Soviet government hopes that the U.S. government will give the U.S. Air Force Command appropriate instructions.

    苏联政府照会美国政府
    强硬抗议美国军用飞机侵犯苏联国境
    【新华社九日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科八日讯：十一月七日，苏联外交部以照会一件送交美国驻苏联大使馆，抗议美国军用飞机侵犯苏联领空的无礼行为。
    照会说：根据已确定的事实，在今年十一月七日坦菲利耶夫岛时间十三点二十分（海参威时间十二点四十一分），一架漆有美国空军标志的B—二十九型四引擎军用飞机，在坦菲利耶夫岛（在千岛群岛）地区侵犯苏联国界，并朝着这个岛的方向继续侵入苏联领空。当这架美国飞机在坦菲利耶夫岛上空飞行时，两架苏联战斗机迎上前去，想要向这架飞机指出它已在苏联国境内，并要求它立即飞离苏联领空。当苏联战斗机迫近时，这架美国飞机向它们开火。鉴于美国入侵者的这种毫无理由的行动，苏联飞机不得不还击，在此以后，这架美国飞机就飞离苏联领空，向西南方向飞去。
    苏联政府对一架美国军用飞机粗暴地侵犯苏联国境的行为，向美国政府提出强硬的抗议。
    照会指出：这是美国飞机又一次侵犯苏联国境。苏联政府曾经促请美国政府注意类似的侵犯行为。
    苏联政府认为采取措施来防止再次发生美国飞机侵犯苏联国境的情事，是符合苏联和美国的利益的，苏联政府并希望美国政府给美国空军司令部以相应的训示。
