Shanxi Province's Unified Purchase and Supply of Grain
Wu Rui

The Victory of the Unified Purchase and Supply of Grain Policy

Since Shanxi Province implemented the unified purchase of grain in the fourth quarter of 1953, the province has overfulfilled its grain purchase plan by 121.3%, which has enabled the state to supply grain according to plan. From January to September this year, the state supplied more than 1,336.6 million jin of grain throughout the province, which not only guaranteed the grain supply to cities and industrial and mining areas, supported industrial construction, but also supplied rations to more than one million grain-deficient households in rural areas.

At present, the urban grain supply has basically become institutionalized. Urban residents reflect: "Since the implementation of planned supply, we are not afraid of not being able to buy grain, nor are we afraid of rising grain prices, nor are we afraid of grain merchants adulterating the grain." Last year, the state purchased 7.82 million jin of grain in Yongji County (cotton-producing area), and this year the grain supplied to the county reached 9,297,000 jin by July. The government has guaranteed the grain needs of disaster areas, which has deeply moved the farmers. For example, Bai Mao, a farmer in Quanzhawan Village, Pianguan County, only sold more than 700 jin of grain to the state during the unified purchase of grain last year, leaving a large amount of grain in reserve for disaster prevention; this year, seeing that the government fully supplied grain to grain-deficient households and people in disaster areas, he sold all the 3,700 jin of grain he had left over to the state. This year, after Shanxi's wheat suffered a serious freeze disaster, grain prices in the province have remained stable. The masses in the Jinnan area unanimously reflected: "If the state had not controlled the grain, the price of grain would have skyrocketed!"

The implementation of the unified purchase and supply of grain has not only promoted the transformation of private commerce, but also effectively打击ed capitalist forces in rural areas, enabling the rural economy to develop healthily and further safeguarding the interests of farmers. For example, before the unified purchase of grain, 1,190 households in Fencheng County had lent out 8,000 shi of grain, causing a serious class differentiation in rural areas; since the land reform, farmers in the county have sold more than 2,590 mu of land. In one village in the county, 36 out of 280 households sold their land. After the implementation of the unified purchase of grain, the elimination of the free grain market eliminated the intermediary exploitation of grain merchants, which greatly limited class differentiation in rural areas. The farmers themselves are very clear about this benefit. Li Jingcai, the head of the Taoli Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yongji County, calculated the following account: Last year, during the period of grain shortage in the spring, grain merchants took the opportunity to raise grain prices, with wheat rising to 1,800 yuan to 2,000 yuan per jin, which was 700 yuan to 900 yuan higher than the state grain price. His cooperative bought more than 10,000 jin of grain from grain merchants, and was exploited by private merchants for more than 8 million yuan compared with the state grain price, which led to his agricultural production cooperative being unable to afford fertilizer after the wheat was damaged by frost, resulting in a poor harvest. This year, 36 households in his cooperative were short of grain, and the state supplied more than 19,000 jin of surplus grain, which was more than 3 million yuan less than the price of private merchants last year. Because farmers can buy the grain they need at reasonable prices, and get rid of the exploitation of unscrupulous merchants and usurers, many old grain-deficient households are no longer short of grain after the summer harvest this year. For example, Huang Jingtai, a grain-deficient household in Xincheng Town, Wanquan, was supplied with more than 1,000 jin of grain by the state this year, and was not subject to the exploitation of usury. After the summer harvest, he became a surplus grain household. He happily said: "If the state had not implemented unified purchase and supply, the wheat harvested this year would have been exploited by usury."

Facts have educated the farmers: the state's implementation of unified purchase and supply of grain is beneficial to the country and the farmers, and has therefore won the support of the majority of farmers. Therefore, this year's summer grain requisition and unified purchase work has more smoothly overfulfilled the state plan than last year, exceeding the original requisition and purchase plan by 14.6%; the requisition and purchase volume accounted for 30% of the total wheat production.

A New Look in Rural Areas, Unprecedented Development of the Mutual Aid and Cooperation Movement

The socialist consciousness of the broad masses of farmers has been unprecedentedly improved through the propaganda and education of the general line and general task. The superiority shown by agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups in the grain sales campaign has further strengthened the determination of farmers to take the socialist road. Last year, during the purchase of grain, the China-Soviet Friendship Collective Farm in Changzhi Prefecture and 984 agricultural production cooperatives collectively sold more than 8 million jin of grain; in Yuci Prefecture, 528 agricultural production cooperatives and perennial mutual aid groups were rewarded for patriotic grain sales. In this summer's unified purchase of grain, according to statistics from Yuncheng Prefecture, agricultural production cooperative farmers accounted for only 6.5% of the prefecture's farmers, but they sold surplus grain that reached 10% of the prefecture's total task. Encouraged by such facts, the broad masses of farmers participated in mutual aid and cooperation with unprecedented enthusiasm, and at the same time a new upsurge of the mutual aid and cooperation movement emerged in the patriotic grain sales campaign. Last year, during the unified purchase of grain, more than 6,500 agricultural production cooperatives were automatically requested to be established by farmers throughout the province, and the actual number established far exceeded this number. By the end of June this year, there were more than 10,600 agricultural production cooperatives in the province, which was four and a half times that of last year; the number of farmers participating in agricultural production cooperatives accounted for 9.4% of the total number of farmers in the province, and together with those participating in mutual aid groups, they accounted for 68% of the total number of farmers. With the development of agricultural production cooperation, supply and marketing cooperation and credit cooperation have also developed by leaps and bounds. By the end of June this year, there were 3,900 supply and marketing cooperatives and 3,419 credit cooperatives in the province. The close combination of the three cooperative economies has powerfully promoted the agricultural production increase movement.

This summer, the promulgation of the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China further improved the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of farmers. Therefore, in this summer's unified purchase of grain, the mutual aid and cooperation movement has greatly advanced. According to incomplete statistics, in this summer's grain purchase work, another 50,000 mutual aid groups and 380,000 farmers actively requested to organize agricultural production cooperatives. In Yuci District alone, more than 250,000 farmers requested to join the cooperative, and all 200 households in Gudongdao Village, Jiaocheng County, requested to build a cooperative. In Linfen Prefecture, 176 new cooperatives were built while purchasing wheat. According to incomplete statistics, 119 new credit cooperatives were built throughout the province this summer, with 89,346 new members and an increase of more than 250 million yuan in share capital. The rural areas have undergone profound changes, and the idea of taking the socialist road has established a huge advantage. This is a new victory in the socialist transformation of agriculture. In August this year, the Shanxi Provincial People's Government proposed at the first session of the first People's Congress of the province: this year, the number of farmers participating in agricultural production cooperatives should reach 30% of the total number of farmers. This call was warmly endorsed by all the representatives. According to the plans currently proposed by various places, more than 33,500 agricultural production cooperatives will be developed throughout the province this autumn and winter, and the number of cooperative members will be expanded to account for 35% of the total number of farmers in the province.

The Primary Market is Becoming More Active, and the Socialist Commercial Position is Becoming Increasingly Consolidated

Due to the state's implementation of the unified grain purchase policy, farmers have "turned dead treasure into living treasure," which has improved the farmers' ability to expand reproduction. With the improvement of the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers, production investment is also rapidly expanding. According to statistics from Yuncheng Prefecture, the production materials supplied by the supply and marketing cooperatives in the district in the first half of this year increased by 133% compared with the same period last year, including an increase of 134% in fertilizers, 866% in farm tools, 477% in carts, and tenfold in livestock.

The improvement of agricultural production and the improvement of farmers' lives are concentratedly reflected in the increasing proportion of rural sales and the active primary market in rural areas. The growth rate of cotton cloth sales of the state-owned cotton yarn and cloth company in the first half of this year compared with the same period last year was: 135% in Linfen County, 274% in Yuncheng County, 145% in Changzhi County, 323% in Xinxian County, and about 88% in Taiyuan and Datong. The increase in the turnover of commodities in the primary market in rural areas is even more rapid. According to statistics from ten market towns such as Houma, the turnover of commodities in the first quarter increased by 52% compared with the same period last year; according to statistics from ten market towns such as Quting, the turnover of commodities in the second quarter increased by 27% compared with the same period last year, and the turnover of commodities in many market towns exceeded the level of the fourth quarter of last year in the first quarter of this year, such as Kuolao Town, which increased by 36% compared with the fourth quarter of last year, Liulin Town, which increased by 5.3% compared with the fourth quarter of last year, and Zhaidian Town, which increased by 6.6% compared with the fourth quarter of last year. The further upsurge of the rural economy reflected in the active rural market means the continuous expansion of the domestic market, which will undoubtedly promote the country's socialist industrialization.

Several Experiences in the Two Unified Purchase and Supply Works

The unified purchase and supply of grain is an arduous and complex new task, which is related to the grain needs of millions of people, the socialist transformation of agriculture, and the development of the entire national economic construction. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out in-depth publicity and education work and meticulous organizational work. It is necessary to be familiar with the situation, have clear policies, and have specific methods. In this work, Shanxi paid special attention to the following issues:

(1) The implementation of the unified purchase and supply of grain is a sharp struggle between socialism and capitalism. This struggle must be used to raise the socialist consciousness of the masses, combat capitalism, and liquidate spontaneous capitalist forces. Therefore, in the two grain purchase works, Shanxi organized a working team of one million people with more than 20,000 cadres above the district level as the backbone, and first launched publicity to the masses about the state's general task in the transition period and the policy of unified purchase and supply of grain. Using concrete facts, the masses were educated to recognize the two roads of socialism and capitalism. After reviewing, comparing, and calculating the three accounts of production, life, and prices since liberation, and comparing the two types of typical examples of good and bad mutual aid and cooperation work, the broad masses of people realized the correctness of the party and government's policies and the brilliant prospects of socialism, and set off a patriotic grain sales and mutual aid and cooperation upsurge. This is the basic driving force for the successful completion of the entire work. At the same time, Shanxi paid special attention to the struggle against the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionary elements and the illegal activities of unscrupulous merchants rushing to purchase and hoard grain. Public security, judicial, and procuratorial departments organized forces to actively protect the grain work. During the unified grain purchase period last year, the procuratorial departments mobilized three-quarters of the procuratorial cadres at all levels in the province to invest in this movement; the people's courts at all levels strengthened the trial of grain cases, and seriously dealt with cases of counter-revolutionary rumors and sabotage and unscrupulous merchants sabotaging the unified purchase and supply of grain, and inspected and found more than 1.3 million jin of hoarded grain, thus fully demonstrating the power of the people's democratic regime to protect economic construction.

(2) Starting from the requirement that grain purchase work must promote the further development of agricultural production, the principle of starting from production and focusing on production was implemented, and a grain purchase plan was formulated, and a plan for the development of agricultural production was also formulated, which ensured that the socialist enthusiasm of the masses was guided to organize and develop production. At the same time, in order to guide farmers to correctly handle the currency obtained after selling grain, a large amount of material supply was organized on the one hand, and preferential savings for grain sales were opened on the other hand. During the summer purchase period this year, according to incomplete statistics, the materials supplied to farmers by supply and marketing cooperatives alone reached more than 140 billion yuan, and banks absorbed 42.9 billion yuan of farmers' deposits and recovered 9.9 billion yuan of agricultural loans. This not only guaranteed the needs of farmers to expand production and improve their lives, but also stabilized market prices.

(3) Grain requisition, unified purchase, and unified supply are a unified whole, and it is necessary to "purchase and supply at the same time," and conduct a survey of grain-deficient households at the same time as unified grain purchase. This work was not paid enough attention to during the purchase last year, which caused certain difficulties for this year's grain supply work. It has been strengthened in this summer's purchase, and the supply situation has improved. Secondly, to do a good job in grain purchase work, it is also necessary to do a good job in leading the grain market. The grain market can not only cooperate with the state's grain plan supply to ensure the grain needs of rural residents and reduce the state's burden on supply, but also promote the activity of the rural market. There are 1,754 such new-type markets in Shanxi, and they have become an important supplementary source of the state's grain supply.

The unified purchase and supply of grain is a new task, and our experience is still insufficient. There are still some problems in the past work, which must be paid attention to and resolved in the future. In terms of purchase, although the grain unified purchase method has been formulated, there are still some specific provisions that are not entirely in line with reality, and need to be further improved in the future. In terms of supply, the main shortcoming is that the understanding of the situation of grain-deficient households is still very insufficient, so some that should not be supplied have been supplied, and the grain-deficient households that should be supplied have been under-supplied. This problem must continue to be solved by strengthening cadre education and clarifying the situation, so as to continuously improve the unified purchase and supply work. In addition, many grain markets in various places have not played their due role, and still need to be rectified.

    山西省的粮食统购统销工作

    粮食统购统销政策的胜利
    山西省自一九五三年第四季度实行粮食统购，全省超额完成粮食收购计划的百分之一百二十一点三，这就使国家有条件按计划进行粮食供应。今年一至九月，国家在全省范围内供应了粮食十三亿三千六百余万斤，不仅保证了对城市和工矿区的粮食供应，支援了工业建设，而且向农村一百多万缺粮户供应了口粮。
    目前城市粮食供应已基本上达到制度化。城市居民反映：“实行计划供应以来，一不怕买不到粮吃，二不怕粮价上涨，三不怕粮商掺杂掺假。”国家去年在永济县（产棉区）统购粮食七百八十二万斤，今年供应该县的粮食到七月份已达九百二十九万七千多斤。政府保证了灾区的粮食需要，使农民感动颇深。如偏关县泉子湾村农民白毛，去年国家统购粮食时，他只出卖了七百多斤，留下大批粮食准备防灾；今年看到政府对缺粮户和灾区人民充分供应粮食，又把原来留下来的三千七百多斤粮食全部卖给了国家。今年山西小麦遭受严重冻灾之后，全省粮价仍一直是稳定的，晋南地区群众一致反映：“要不是国家掌握了粮食，这一下粮价可涨得没底啦！”
    实行粮食统购统销，不仅促进了对私营商业的改造，而且有力地打击了农村的资本主义势力，使农村经济得以健康地发展，进一步保障了农民的利益。如汾城县在粮食统购前有一千一百九十户放出了八千石粮食，造成农村阶级的严重分化；全县自实行土地改革以来，农民出卖土地达二千五百九十多亩。该县有一个村二百八十户中就有三十六户卖了土地。实行了粮食统购之后，由于取缔了粮食自由市场，就消除了粮商的中间剥削，这就大大限制了农村阶级的分化。这种好处农民自己是知道得很清楚的。永济县桃李村农业生产合作社社长李敬才算了这样一笔账：去年春季青黄不接时，粮商乘机抬高粮价，小麦每斤涨到一千八百元到二千元，比国家粮价高七百元到九百元。他的社从粮商手中买了一万多斤粮食，和国家粮价相比就被私商剥削了八百余万元，以致他的农业生产合作社在小麦受冻后无力买肥田粉施肥而歉收。今年他的社三十六户缺粮，由国家供应了一万九千多斤余粮，和去年私商粮价比较，少出了三百多万元。由于农民能够以合理价格买到他们所需要的粮食，摆脱了奸商和高利贷者的剥削，好多老缺粮户今年夏收后也不缺粮了。如万泉新城镇黄敬太是个老缺粮户，今年国家供应了他一千多斤粮食，没有遭受高利贷的盘剥，夏收后变成了余粮户。他高兴地说：“要不是国家实行统购统销，今年打下的麦子还要被高利贷盘剥一空。”
    事实教育了农民：国家实行粮食统购统销，对国家、对农民都是有利的，因而得到了广大农民的拥护。因此，今年夏季的粮食征收和统购工作比去年更顺利地超额完成了国家计划，比原征收和收购计划超过了百分之十四点六；征收和收购量占小麦总产量的百分之三十。
    农村面貌一新，互助合作运动空前发展
    广大农民经过总路线总任务的宣传教育，社会主义觉悟空前地提高了。农业生产合作社和互助组在售粮运动中显示出来的优越性，更加坚定了农民走社会主义道路的决心。去年收购粮食时，长治专区中苏友好集体农庄和九百八十四个农业生产合作社集体售粮八百余万斤；榆次专区爱国售粮中受到奖励的农业生产合作社和常年互助组有五百二十八个单位。今夏统购粮食中，据运城专区统计，农业生产合作社农户只占全专区农户的百分之六点五，他们出卖的余粮却达到全专区总任务的百分之十。在这样事实的鼓舞下，广大农民以空前无比的热情参加互助合作，在爱国售粮运动中同时出现了互助合作运动的新高潮。去年粮食统购时，全省农民自动要求建立的农业生产合作社达六千五百多个，实际建成的远远超过此数。到今年六月底，全省已有农业生产合作社一万零六百多个，为去年的四倍半；参加农业生产合作社的农户已占全省农户总数的百分之九点四，连同参加互助组的在内，已占农户总数的百分之六十八。随着农业生产合作的发展，供销合作和信用合作也都有了飞跃的发展。截止今年六月底，全省已有供销合作社三千九百个，信用合作社三千四百一十九个。三种合作经济紧密结合，有力地推动了农业增产运动。
    今年夏季，中华人民共和国宪法草案的公布，进一步提高了广大农民的社会主义觉悟，因此，在今夏粮食统购中，互助合作运动又大大前进了一步。据不完全统计，在今夏收购粮食工作中，又有五万个互助组和三十八万农户积极要求组织农业生产合作社。只榆次区就有二十五万多农户要求入社，交城县古洞道村二百户农户全部要求建社。临汾专区在收购小麦同时，新建了一百七十六个社。据不完全统计，全省今夏新建信用合作社一百一十九个，社员增加八万九千三百四十六人，股金增加二十五亿余万元。农村面貌起了深刻的变化，走社会主义道路的思想已树立了巨大的优势。这是对农业实行社会主义改造的新胜利。今年八月，山西省人民政府在全省第一届人民代表大会第一次会议上提出：今年内要达到使参加农业生产合作社的农户占全部农户的百分之三十。这一号召得到了全体代表的热烈拥护。按照目前各地提出的计划，今年秋冬全省农业生产合作社将要发展到三万三千五百个以上，入社农户将扩大到占全省总农户的百分之三十五。
    初级市场愈趋活跃，社会主义商业阵地日益巩固
    由于国家实行了粮食统购政策，农民们“把死宝变成了活宝”，就提高了农民扩大再生产的能力。随着广大农民生产积极性的提高，生产投资也在迅速扩大。据运城专区统计，全区供销合作社今年上半年供应的生产资料较去年同期增加了百分之一百三十三，其中肥料增加了一百三十四，农具增加了八百六十六，大车增加了四百七十七，牲口增加了十倍。
    农业生产的提高和农民生活的改善，集中地表现在农村销售比重的日益增长和农村初级市场的活跃上。国营花纱布公司今年上半年棉布销售量较去年同期增长速度为：临汾县百分之一百三十五，运城县百分之二百七十四，长治县百分之一百四十五，忻县百分之三百二十三，太原、大同两市百分之八十八左右。农村初级市场商品流转额增长的幅度更为迅速。据候马等十个集镇市场统计，第一季度商品流转额较去年同期增加百分之五十二；曲亭等十个集镇市场统计，第二季度商品流转额较去年同期增加百分之二十七，并有不少集镇市场今年第一季度商品流转额超过了去年第四季度水平，如栲栳镇较去年第四季度增加了百分之三十六，柳林镇较去年第四季度增加了百分之五点三，翟店镇较去年第四季度增加了百分之六点六。广大农村市场活跃所反映出来的农村经济的进一步高涨，就意味着国内市场的不断扩大，这对于国家社会主义工业化事业，无疑地将会发生促进作用。
    两次统购统销工作中的几点经验
    粮食统购统销是一件艰巨、复杂的新工作，它关系着千百万人民的粮食需要，关系着农业的社会主义改造，关系着整个国家经济建设的发展。因而必须进行深入的宣传教育工作和细致的组织工作。要情况熟悉，政策明确，方法具体。在这一工作当中，山西特别注意了以下几个问题：
    （一）实行粮食统购统销，是社会主义和资本主义一场尖锐的斗争，必须通过这场斗争来提高群众的社会主义觉悟，打击资本主义和清算资本主义自发势力。因此，在两次收购粮食工作中，山西都组织了以两万多名区以上干部为骨干的百万人的工作队，首先对群众展开关于国家在过渡时期的总任务和粮食统购统销政策的宣传，用具体的事实，教育群众认清社会主义和资本主义的两条道路。广大群众经过回忆、对比，经过算解放以来生产、生活、物价的三笔账，经过对比互助合作工作好坏两种典型，认识了党和政府政策的正确和社会主义的光辉远景，掀起了爱国售粮和互助合作的热潮。这是整个工作得以胜利完成的基本动力。同时，山西特别注意了和反革命分子的破坏活动及奸商抢购囤积的违法行为作斗争。公安、司法、检察部门都组织力量积极保卫了粮食工作。去年统购粮食时期，只检察部门即动员全省各级检察干部四分之三投入这一运动；各级人民法院都加强了对粮食案件的审判，认真地处理反革命造谣破坏和奸商破坏粮食统购统销的案件，检查出囤积的粮食达一百三十余万斤，这样，就充分发挥了人民民主政权保卫经济建设的威力。
    （二）从粮食收购工作必须促进农业生产的进一步发展的要求出发，贯彻了从生产入手落足于生产的原则，制订了粮食收购计划，同时也制订了发展农业生产的计划，这就保证了把群众的社会主义热情引导到组织起来发展生产。同时，为了指导农民正确地处理售粮后得来的货币，一方面组织了大量的物资供应，一方面开办了售粮优待储蓄。今年夏季收购期中，据不完全统计，仅供销社供应农民的物资即达一千四百余亿元，银行吸收农民存款四百二十九亿元，收回农业贷款九十九亿元。这样，既保证了农民扩大生产与改善生活的需要，又稳定了市场物价。
      （三）粮食征收、统购、统销三件工作是一个统一的整体，必须“边收购、边供应”，在统购粮食同时就要进行缺粮摸底工作。这一工作，在去年收购时注意不够，给今年粮食供应工作造成一定的困难，今年夏季收购中已注意加强，供应情况已有好转。其次，要做好粮食收购工作，还必须做好对粮食市场的领导工作。粮食市场不仅可以配合国家的粮食计划供应，保证乡村居民的粮食需要，减轻国家在供应上的负担，而且可以促进农村市场的活跃。山西现有这种新型市场一千七百五十四个，它们已成为国家粮食供应的一个重要的补充来源。
    粮食统购统销是一件新的工作，对我们来说，经验还是不足的。在过去的工作中还存在着一些问题，今后必须注意解决。在收购方面，虽制定了粮食统购办法，但在若干具体规定方面尚有不尽切合实际的地方，需要今后作进一步的改善。在供应方面，主要缺点是对缺粮户的情况了解仍很不够，因而有些不应供应的供应了，对应供应的缺粮户反而供应不足。这一问题必须继续从加强干部教育和摸清情况入手，很好地加以解决，以便使统购统销工作不断提高。此外，各地粮食市场有不少还不能起到应有的作用，仍须继续加以整顿。
