Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, November 22nd: The Polish Press Agency broadcast: On November 20th, the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs delivered a note to the U.S. Embassy in Warsaw regarding the detention of Polish merchant ships in the Far East waters controlled by the U.S. military.

The note stated: The Government of the Polish People's Republic has protested in its previous notes on this issue against these illegal acts that harm Polish sailors and Polish ships, and has also demanded that the U.S. government take appropriate measures to immediately release the detained sailors and return them to their country, as well as return the hijacked ships and goods to Poland.

Despite repeated demands from the Polish government and repeated protests from the Polish public, the families of the detained sailors, and many international organizations, the crew of the "President Gottwald" have been detained for six months and deprived of the opportunity to return to their homeland. Like the crew of the "Praca" before them, the crew of the "President Gottwald" have been subjected to brutal pressure, intimidation, and coercion. They are detained like prisoners under the guard of armed military police. The atmosphere created there has driven the sailors to desperate actions, as evidenced by the suicide of one sailor.

All these brutal means are aimed at destroying the sailors' unwavering spirit and forcing them to betray their country. The statements of the "Praca" crew members who returned to their homeland after continuous efforts by the Polish People's Republic government and with the help of the Swedish Red Cross provide conclusive proof of the pressure exerted on the Polish sailors and how U.S. representatives, including the U.S. ambassador to Taiwan, played a leading role in these activities. A copy of their statement is attached to this note.

The note pointed out that the actions of the U.S. government and its subordinates violate commonly observed principles of international law and the basic rights of personal freedom that U.S. politicians are so keen to promote.

The Government of the Polish People's Republic strongly protests against these actions and once again demands the release of the sailors detained in Taiwan, the return of the two ships "Praca" and "President Gottwald," as well as the cargo on board, to Poland, and the punishment of those responsible for these illegal actions.

    波兰政府抗议美国残酷对待被扣波兰船员
    【新华社二十二日讯】塔斯社华沙讯：波兰通讯社广播：波兰外交部十一月二十日就波兰商船在为美国军方控制的远东海面被扣一事交给美国驻华沙大使馆一件照会。
    照会中说：波兰人民共和国政府已在它以前就这一问题发出的几次照会中对这种损害波兰船员和波兰船只的非法行为提出抗议，并且还曾要求美国政府采取适当的措施，立即释放被扣的船员返国和把被劫的船只和货物归还波兰。
    尽管波兰政府一再的要求，波兰公众、被扣船员的家属以及许多国际组织一再的抗议，但是，“哥特瓦尔德总统号”的船员已被扣了六个月并且被剥夺了返回祖国的机会。“哥特瓦尔德总统号”船员就像“工作号”船员先前一样，受到粗暴的压力、恫吓和胁诈，他们就像犯人一样，在武装的宪兵看守下被拘留。那里所造成的气氛使船员们采取绝望行动，有一名船员自杀就说明了这一点。
    这一切粗暴手段的目的是要毁坏船员们的坚贞不屈的精神，迫使他们背叛祖国。经过波兰人民共和国政府不断努力和瑞典红十字会的帮助才返回祖国的“工作号”船员的声明，就确凿地证明：波兰海员受到了什么压力，美国代表、包括美国驻台湾大使在内，在这些活动中如何起着主谋的作用。本照会附上他们的声明的副本。
    照会中指出，美国政府和它的下属的行为破坏共同遵守的国际法的准则和美国政治家们所热衷地宣扬的人身自由的起码权利。
    波兰人民共和国政府坚决抗议这种行为，并再次要求释放被扣在台湾的船员，把“工作号”和“哥特瓦尔德总统号”这两艘船只以及船上的货物归还波兰，惩办作出这种非法行动的人。
