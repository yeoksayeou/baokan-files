    At the Military Tribunal of the Supreme People's Court
    Lin Hong
    Recently, the Military Tribunal of the Supreme People's Court held trials for two major criminal cases involving American spies plotting sabotage activities within our country and endangering our national security. On the judge's bench in the Military Tribunal sat the presiding judge and two judges. On the right side sat the military procurator of the Supreme People's Procuratorate and interpreters, while on the left sat the clerk and defense lawyers. The courtroom was filled with people in the audience, and the entire atmosphere was solemn.
    This is not the first time our country has tried cases of American spies and secret agents. In recent years, American espionage agencies have adopted various extremely vile and shameless means to dispatch a large number of spies and secret agents from land, sea, and air into our country, plotting to subvert our people's democratic regime from within and directly serving the American government's expansion of armed interference in our country and new aggressive wars. The American spies Donnely and others, eleven in total, and American spies Arnold and others, eleven in total, who were captured this time, are pawns executing America's sinister war policy.
    After the presiding judge formally announced the opening of the court, the American spies Donnely and others were tried first. The audience watched the American spies being brought in with hatred. The spies stood timidly in the courtroom. After the presiding judge questioned the defendants one by one about their names, ages, nationalities, and occupations, he said to them: "Our country is an independent and democratic country, and the independence and security of our country will not be violated by any imperialists. Anyone who dares to endanger the independence and security of our country will be punished by our laws. Today, the Military Tribunal of this court accepts the public prosecution of the Supreme People's Procuratorate and opens a court to try your case. In the just court of our country, you should honestly answer the questions. At the same time, this Military Tribunal protects your legitimate rights in accordance with the law, appoints defense lawyers to defend you, and you can also make factual appeals."
    After the presiding judge finished speaking, the military procurator of the Supreme People's Procuratorate stood up and read the indictment of the Supreme People's Procuratorate of the People's Republic of China. The indictment used conclusive facts and many irrefutable evidences to show that this group of American spies and secret agents committed the serious crime of sneaking into our country by plane to plot sabotage activities and endanger our national security. The indictment first pointed out that Donnely and Fecteau were both spies of the American "Central Intelligence Agency." After receiving specialized espionage training in the American espionage agency for conducting terrorist sabotage and organizing armed riots in the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries, they were successively transferred by the American "Central Intelligence Agency" to the Atsugi espionage agency stationed in Japan to train secret agents and airdrop and dispatch secret agents to our country. In the spring of 1952, Donnely accepted the order of the person in charge of the Atsugi espionage agency of the "Central Intelligence Agency" stationed in Japan and selected a group of Chinese-籍 American secret agents, including Li Junying and Zhang Zaiwen, from the espionage training institution established by the American "Central Intelligence Agency" in Japan, and gave them airdrop training. Ten of them were formed into a "Wen Team" and a "Shen Team," which were airdropped into Jilin Province in July and September 1952, respectively. Their missions were to establish armed secret agent "bases," hide secret agent "safe houses," "airdrop sites," and transportation lines from the "bases" to Shenyang in the Northeast region; collect intelligence on our national defense facilities, industrial area targets, and weather; rescue American air force personnel who had invaded our country and were shot down, and recruit remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to carry out armed riots. In August 1952, Donnely personally sneaked into the airspace of Jilin Province, China, by plane to airdrop food and other supplies to the "Wen Team," and in October of the same year, he airdropped another American secret agent, Li Junying, into Jilin Province to inspect the activities of the "Wen Team." On the night of November 29, 1952, Donnely and another American spy, Fecteau, sneaked into the airspace of Jilin Province by plane. In addition to contacting the "Wen Team" and providing them with supplies, they also attempted to use an air retrieval device to take the ground agent Li Junying back from the air to report the situation in order to strengthen the evil activities of airdropping agents into our country. After this plane, which was specially used for secret agent activities, was shot down by us, two crew members were killed on the spot, and Donnely and Fecteau were captured. We seized their criminal evidence on the spot, including pistols, various telecommunications equipment, maps, and equipment for air retrieval of secret agents. The remaining nine secret agents were captured successively, and two were killed.
    After the military procurator detailed the crimes of this group of American spies and secret agents, he pointed out: The above facts have fully proved that Donnely, Fecteau, and others are all active executors of the American imperialist's sinister policy of plotting to carry out sabotage and destruction activities against our country and expand aggression against our country. They have committed the serious crime of directly sabotaging our peaceful construction and endangering our national security. The military procurator, on behalf of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, filed a public prosecution with the Military Tribunal of the Supreme People's Court, requesting that this group of American spies and secret agents be severely punished in accordance with the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Punishing Counterrevolutionaries."
    After the military procurator finished the prosecution, the court began the trial of the defendants. The first to be tried was the American spy Donnely. The following is the presiding judge's questions and Donnely's answers:
    "What work did you do in the United States before you were arrested? What kind of training have you received?"
    "I worked for the Central Intelligence Agency in the United States and received spy training."
    "What is the content and purpose of the training? How was it trained?"
    "The content of the training is demolition, map identification, radio, etc. All this training is secret and is intended to carry out terrorist sabotage and armed riots in communist countries."
    "Were you sent by the US Central Intelligence Agency to Atsugi, Japan, to train Chinese people?"
    "I have trained them. Wen Shijie, Si Xueshen, and Jiang Dazhi (i.e. Zhang Zaiwen, Xu Guangzhi, and Yu Guanzhou) in the court are all trained by me."
    "How many times have you been to China in person?"
    "Twice."
    "What for?"
    "Once was in August 1952, I flew into the airspace of Jilin Province, China, by plane to send food and supplies to a paratrooper team airdropped in Jilin Province. Once was on the night of November 29, 1952, when I flew into Chinese airspace in a C-47 aircraft in order to take away Bu Jingwu (i.e. Li Junying) from the air."
    "Do you know that your actions constitute a serious crime endangering China's security?"
    "Yes, I know my criminal behavior is completely true."
    Then, one by one, the American spies and secret agents such as Fecteau, Zhang Zaiwen, Yu Guanzhou, and Xu Guangzhi were brought to the court. Fecteau also said that he had received specialized secret training from the US "Central Intelligence Agency" to conduct espionage activities in the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries. He confessed to his crime of airdropping secret agents into China with Donnely, and sneaking into the northeast airspace of our country by plane to provide assistance and take secret agents from the air. The remaining nine Chinese-籍 American secret agents were originally officers of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army. After the reactionary rule of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique on the mainland was destroyed, they fled to Hong Kong one after another to join the American espionage organization "Free China Movement." After receiving specialized secret agent training in assassination, demolition, armed riots, intelligence gathering, and secret communication at the espionage training institution established by the American "Central Intelligence Agency" in Japan, they were successively sent by American espionage agencies to airdrop them into the northeast of our country by plane, committing the serious crime of betraying the motherland and endangering the peaceful construction of the motherland. During the interrogation, these American secret agent elements answered the presiding judge's questions one by one and confessed their criminal facts.
    At this point in the interrogation, the defense lawyers defended each defendant. In their speeches, each defense lawyer pointed out: After a detailed study of the materials of Donnely and Fecteau and others, it was found that this group of American spies and secret agents did commit serious crimes of plotting terrorist sabotage activities and endangering the security of our country within our country, and no questions can be raised regarding the criminal facts. However, the defense lawyers believe that the real instigators of this criminal activity are the American aggressive group and its subordinate espionage agencies, and the defendants such as Donnely were only executing the orders of their superiors; as for those Chinese-籍 American secret agents, their degree of criminality is indeed very serious, but some of them have frankly confessed or have shown remorse, so they requested the presiding judge to handle them leniently according to the different criminal circumstances of each defendant. At this time, the military procurator and the defense lawyer made a reply. After the reply ended, the presiding judge asked each defendant again: "Do you have anything else to say?" At this time, the defendant Donnely looked at the presiding judge with pleading eyes and said: "Please have mercy, judge." The remaining defendants also said that they had nothing to say, thinking that the defense lawyer had said it well.
    Then, the American spies Arnold, Baumel, and other eleven American spies were brought to the court. First, the presiding judge questioned them one by one about their names, ages, nationalities, and occupations, and then the military procurator of the Supreme People's Procuratorate read the indictment of the Supreme People's Procuratorate of the People's Republic of China, and then the presiding judge questioned the defendants one by one, and finally the defense lawyer defended each defendant. According to the indictment, the American spies Arnold and others were captured on the night of January 12, 1953, when they invaded the airspace of Liaoning Province, China, to carry out espionage reconnaissance activities to spy on our national defense facilities after they were shot down by us. Arnold was the colonel commander of the American "581st Air Supply and Communication Squadron." This squadron serves the American espionage agency "Central Intelligence Agency" and is specifically used to airdrop spies and secret agents to China, the Soviet Union, and people's democratic countries, supply supplies for spies and secret agents, and maintain communication and contact with ground spies and secret agents. The squadron was established at Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho, USA in 1951, and transferred to Clark Air Force Base in the Philippines in July 1952. Shortly thereafter, it began its criminal activities. During the trial, the criminals had to bow their heads and confess their crimes in the face of accurate facts. Baumel also confessed that in addition to this time when he and Arnold and others sneaked into the northeast airspace of our country to carry out criminal activities, he also carried out espionage reconnaissance activities to spy on our defense facilities in the coastal areas of China twice. One time was taking off from Yokota Airport in Japan, and one time was taking off from Clark Airport in the Philippines. The following is an excerpt of the presiding judge's questions and the defendant's answers during the interrogation of Arnold:
    "What kind of squadron is the '581st Air Supply and Communication Squadron'?"
    "It is a squadron that performs special missions."
    "What is its mission?"
    "It serves the Central Intelligence Agency. The actual mission is to airdrop secret agents, maintain communication with them, and airdrop supplies to them."
    "You and Baumel and others sneaked into Chinese airspace this time to carry out reconnaissance activities, endangering China's security. Do you know this is a crime?"
    "Yes, I know this is a crime."
    After the court completed the above trial procedures for these two American spy cases, the presiding judge announced a temporary adjournment, and the defendants awaited the final verdict of the court. After the presiding judge and the two judges retired for deliberation, the court reopened on November 23, and the presiding judge announced the verdicts for these two groups of American spies and secret agents, giving them different legal sanctions. At this time, the people in the audience stood up and unanimously supported the court's just verdict. This trial once again exposed the ugly face of the American aggressors who are enemies of the people of our country in front of the people of the world, and it is a heavy blow to the sabotage activities of the American imperialists; it is a major education for the people of our country, telling us that we should raise our revolutionary vigilance at all times in order to effectively smash all the enemy's conspiracies and tricks, safeguard the independence and security of the country, and protect the free and happy life of the people of our country.

    在最高人民法院的军事审判庭上
    林洪
    最近，最高人民法院军事审判庭开庭审理了两批美国间谍阴谋在我国境内进行破坏活动、危害我国安全的重大犯罪案件。在军事审判庭的审判席上坐着审判长和两个审判员，右面的席位上坐着最高人民检察院的军事检察员和翻译人员，左面的席位上坐着书记员和辩护人，审判席的对面坐满了旁听的人们，整个法庭充满了严肃的气氛。
    在我们国家里审判美国间谍特务案件，这已经不是第一次。最近几年来，美国间谍机关采取了各种极其卑鄙无耻的手段，把大量的间谍特务从陆地、海上和空中派遣到我国境内，阴谋从内部颠覆我国的人民民主政权，并且直接为美国政府扩大对我国的武装干涉和新的侵略战争服务。这次被我捕获的美国间谍唐奈等十一人和美国间谍阿诺德等十一人，就是执行美国这一罪恶的战争政策的爪牙。
    审判长正式宣布开庭后，首先受审判的是美国间谍唐奈等十一人。旁听的人们用憎恨的眼光注视着被带进来的美国间谍，间谍们胆怯地站立在审判庭上。审判长一一地讯问过被告的姓名、年龄、国籍、籍贯、职业以后对他们说：“我们的国家是一个独立民主的国家，我国的独立和安全绝不容许任何帝国主义者侵犯；谁如果敢于危害我国的独立和安全，就一定要受到我国法律的制裁。今天本院军事审判庭接受最高人民检察院的公诉，开庭审判你们的案件。在我国正义的审判庭上，你们应该老老实实地回答问题。同时本军事审判庭依法保障你们的合法权利，指定有辩护人为你们辩护，你们自己也可以据实申诉。”
    审判长讲话完毕以后，即由最高人民检察院军事检察员起立宣读中华人民共和国最高人民检察院起诉书。起诉书用确凿的事实和许多无可辩驳的证据说明：这一批美国间谍特务犯有乘用飞机偷入我国阴谋进行破坏活动、危害我国安全的重大罪行。起诉书首先指出：唐奈和费克图都是美国“中央情报局”的间谍，他们在美国间谍机关受过对苏联和人民民主国家进行恐怖破坏和组织武装暴乱的专门间谍训练后，先后由美国“中央情报局”调到该局驻日本的厚木间谍机关工作，担任训练特务和向我国空投和派遣间谍特务的工作。一九五二年春天，唐奈接受“中央情报局”驻日本厚木间谍机关负责人的命令，从美国“中央情报局”设在日本的间谍训练机构挑选了一批中国籍的美国特务李军英、张载文等十一人，对他们施以空投训练后，其中十人编成了一个“文队”和一个“沈队”，分别在一九五二年七月和九月把他们空投到吉林省境内，任务是在东北境内建立武装特务的“根据地”、掩藏特务的“安全处所”、“空投场”和从“根据地”到沈阳的交通线；搜集我国国防设施、工业地区目标及气象情报；救护入侵我国被击落的美国空军人员，并收罗蒋贼卖国集团残余分子进行武装暴乱。一九五二年八月，唐奈曾亲自乘飞机潜入我国吉林省上空，为“文队”空投粮食及其他物资，并在同年十月又把另一美国特务李军英空投到吉林省境内，视察“文队”的活动情况。一九五二年十一月二十九日夜，唐奈又偕另一美国间谍费克图乘坐飞机潜入吉林省上空，除了和“文队”联络和接济他们物资以外，还企图从空中把地面特务李军英用空取器取回汇报情况，以便加强对我国空投特务的罪恶活动。这架专供特务活动使用的飞机被我击落以后，驾驶人员两名当场毙命，唐、费二人被捕获，我们当场缴获了他们的犯罪证据手枪、各种电讯器材、地图以及空取特务的器具等。其余特务先后捕获九名，击毙二名。
    军事检察员详细说明了这一批美国间谍特务的罪行后指出：上述事实已充分证明唐奈、费克图等人都是美帝国主义阴谋对我国进行暗害破坏活动并扩大对我国侵略的罪恶政策的积极执行者，他们犯有直接破坏我国和平建设、危害我国安全的重大罪行。军事检察员代表最高人民检察院向最高人民法院军事审判庭提起公诉，请求依照“中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例”严厉惩治这一批美国间谍特务。
    军事检察员起诉完了以后，法庭开始了对被告的审讯。首先被审讯的是美国间谍唐奈。下面就是审判长的问话和唐奈的答话：
    “你被捕以前在美国做什么工作？受过什么训练？”
    “在美国中央情报局工作，受过间谍训练。”
      “训练内容和目的是什么？怎样训练的？”
    “训练的内容是爆破、辨认地图、无线电等。这一切训练都是秘密的，都是为了在共产主义国家进行恐怖破坏和武装暴动的。”
    “你被美国中央情报局派到日本厚木去训练过中国人吗？”
    “训练过，现在法庭上的文世杰、斯学深、蒋大志（即张载文、许广智、于冠洲）都是我训练的。”
    “你亲自到中国来过几次？”
      “两次。”
      “干什么的？”
    “一次是在一九五二年八月，我坐着飞机，飞入中国吉林省上空，给空投在吉林省的一个空降队送粮食和物资。一次是在一九五二年十一月二十九日夜，乘坐C—47型飞机飞入中国领空，为了要从空中取走卜经武（即李军英）。
    “你知道你的行为犯了危害中国安全的重大罪行吗？”
    “是的，我知道我的犯罪行为是完全真实的。”
    接着被一个一个地带到法庭上来的是费克图、张载文、于冠州、许广智等美国间谍特务。费克图也说他曾经受过美国“中央情报局”的专门到苏联和人民民主国家进行间谍活动的秘密训练，他供认了他和唐奈一起向中国空投特务，并且乘坐飞机秘密潜入我国东北领空接济和空取特务的罪行。其余的中国籍的美国特务张载文等九人原来都是蒋贼军的军官，在蒋介石卖国集团在大陆上的反动统治被摧毁后，他们先后逃亡到香港参加了美国的间谍组织“自由中国运动”。他们在美国“中央情报局”设在日本的间谍训练机构中受过暗杀、爆破、武装暴乱、刺探情报和秘密交通等专门的间谍特务训练后，先后由美国间谍机关派飞机把他们空投到我国东北境内，犯有背叛祖国和危害祖国和平建设的重大罪行。在审讯过程中，这几个美国特务分子一一地回答了审判长的询问，供认了自己的犯罪事实。
    审讯至此，由辩护人为各个被告辩护。每个辩护人在发言中都指出：在详细研究唐奈和费克图等人的材料以后，发现这一批美国间谍特务确实犯了阴谋在我国境内进行恐怖破坏活动、危害我国安全的重大罪行，在犯罪事实方面提不出任何问题。但是辩护人认为，这次犯罪活动的真正主使者是美国侵略集团及其所属的间谍机关，被告唐奈等只是为了执行上级的命令；至于那些中国籍的美国特务，他们的犯罪程度的确是很严重的，但是其中有些人已经坦白供认或者有了悔罪的表现，因此请求审判长根据各个被告的不同的犯罪情节从轻予以处理。这时军事检察员和辩护人又作了答辩。答辩结束以后，审判长又问各个被告：“还有要说的话吗？”这时被告唐奈用恳求的眼光望着审判长说：“请求法官开恩。”其余的被告也都表示没有什么说的，认为辩护人说得很好。
    接着被带到法庭上来的是美国间谍阿诺德、包莫等十一个美国间谍。首先也是由审判长一一地讯问他们的姓名、年龄、国籍、籍贯、职业，再由最高人民检察院军事检察员宣读中华人民共和国最高人民检察院起诉书，然后由审判长逐个地审问被告，最后由辩护人为每一个被告辩护。据起诉书说，美国间谍阿诺德等十一人，是在一九五三年一月十二日夜侵入我国辽宁省上空进行刺探我国国防设施的间谍侦察活动时被我击落后捕获的。阿诺德是美国“五八一空中补给与通讯联队”的上校司令官，这个联队是为美国间谍机关“中央情报局”服务，专门用来对中国、苏联和人民民主国家进行空投间谍特务，供给间谍特务使用的补给物资，并和地面上的间谍特务保持通讯联络等间谍特务活动的联队之一。这个联队于一九五一年在美国爱达荷州山家空军基地成立，一九五二年七月调驻菲律宾克拉克空军基地，其后不久就开始了它的罪恶活动。审讯中，罪犯们在确切的事实面前，只好低头认罪。包莫还供认他除了这一次和阿诺德等人偷入我国东北领空进行罪恶活动以外，他还两次在中国沿海地区进行刺探我国防设施的间谍侦察活动。一次是从日本的横田机场起飞，一次是从菲律宾的克拉克机场起飞。下面是在审讯阿诺德时审判长的问话和被告的答话的摘记：
    “‘五八一空中补给与通讯联队’是一个什么样性质的联队？”
    “它是一个执行特殊任务的联队。”
    “它的任务是什么？”
    “它是为中央情报局服务的，实际的任务是空投特务，和他们保持通讯联络，并给他们空投补给物资。”
    “你这次和包莫等人潜入中国领空，进行侦察活动，危害了中国的安全，你知道这是犯罪吗？”
    “是的，我知道这是犯罪。”
    法庭在完成对这两个美国间谍案件的上述审讯程序以后，审判长宣布暂时退庭，各被告等候法庭的最后判决。审判长和两个审判员在退庭实行合议以后，法庭在十一月二十三日重新开庭，审判长宣布了对于这两批美国间谍特务的判决，对他们分别给予了不同的法律制裁。这时旁听席上的人们起立，一致拥护法庭的正义判决。这一次的审判，再一次在世界人民的面前揭露了美国侵略者与我国人民为敌的丑恶嘴脸，对于美帝国主义者的暗害活动是一个沉重的打击；对于我国人民则是一个重大的教育，它告诉我们每时每刻都应该提高革命警惕，才能有效地粉碎敌人的一切阴谋诡计，保障国家的独立和安全，保护我国人民自由幸福的生活。
