    Full-Scale Construction Begins on the Final Phase of the Kangzang Highway
    The final phase of the Kangzang Highway is now under full-scale construction. After the People's Liberation Army soldiers and workers constructing the eastern section broke through the last great mountain – the Seqila Mountain – the road-building army has deployed to the new worksite, seventy-odd kilometers long, where the eastern and western sections of the project will connect, and construction has already begun. The western section road-building troops and Tibetan civilian workers also arrived at the end point of their work area at the end of October. Now, the construction areas of the two road-building armies are separated by only a river, and bridge workers began building a bridge over this river at the end of last month. After this phase of the project is completed, only a portion of the bridge and stone work on the western section of the Kangzang Highway will remain.
    This entire phase of the project is located on the flat, low-altitude alluvial plain of the Niyang River, with the closest point to the Yarlung Tsangpo River being only ten kilometers. In this final phase of the project, the enthusiasm of the soldiers and workers is particularly high. The road-building troops continue to implement the patriotic campaign to build Tibet and make meritorious contributions. Cadres and soldiers have all expressed their determination to add merit upon merit in the construction of the Kangzang Highway. After work began, the workers also launched a full-scale labor emulation campaign. The work efficiency of all road builders has reached more than 150% of the standard quota. The first construction troops to enter the work area completed more than 15% of the roadbed construction on the 16-kilometer construction line in four days, with work efficiency generally exceeding the quota by more than double, and the work efficiency of many squads and platoons reaching 500% of the prescribed standard.
    In the past few days, a magnificent labor scene has unfolded in the sunny Niyang River valley under the gentle sunshine. The songs of the road-building teams on the north bank echo the mountain songs of the Tibetan farmers plowing the land for winter cultivation on the opposite bank.

    康藏公路最后一期工程全面动工
    康藏公路最后的一期工程已全面动工。修筑东段的人民解放军战士和工人在打通最后一座大山——色齐拉山后，筑路大军的队伍已摆到东西两段工程衔接点的七十多公里的新工地上，并已开始施工。西段筑路部队和藏族民工也在十月底到达了工区终点。现在，两路筑路大军的施工区仅隔一河之地，而桥梁工人早在上月底就已开始在这条河上架桥。这期工程全部完成后，康藏公路就只剩下西段的部分桥梁工程和石方工程了。
    这期工程全部在地势平坦、拔海较低的尼洋河冲积平原上，离雅鲁藏布江最近的地方仅十公里。在最后这期工程中，战士、工人们的劳动热情特别高。筑路部队继续贯彻爱国建藏立功运动，干部战士都表示要在修筑康藏公路中功上加功，工人们开工以后也全面展开了劳动竞赛。全体筑路人员的工作效率都达到了标准定额的百分之一百五十以上。最先进入工区的施工部队，在十六公里的施工线上，四天中就完成了百分之十五以上的路基工程，工作效率普遍超过了定额一倍多，不少班排的工作效率达到了规定标准的百分之五百。
    几天来，天气晴朗的尼洋河谷里，在温和的阳光照耀下展开着一幅壮丽的劳动图景，北岸筑路队伍的歌声和对岸正在冬耕的藏族农民的山歌遥相呼应。　（新华社）
