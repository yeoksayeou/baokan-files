Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 18th: TASS reports from Prague on November 17th: The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Czechoslovak National Assembly held a meeting on the 16th to discuss the Soviet government's suggestion in its November 13th note aimed at strengthening peace and European security.

　　The meeting heard a report from Prime Minister Viliam Široký, who briefly explained the government's views on the Soviet note.

　　The meeting also passed an appeal to members of parliament of European countries, calling on them to reject the London and Paris Agreements and to demand that their governments participate in the Soviet-proposed Pan-European Conference.

　　The appeal begins by pointing out: The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Czechoslovak National Assembly unanimously agrees with the decision of the Government of the Czechoslovak Republic to participate in the conference proposed by the Soviet government to be held on November 29th this year to discuss the establishment of a European collective security system. This conference, to be attended by all European countries, the United States, and the People's Republic of China, is in the vital interests of all Czechoslovak peoples. The purpose of the conference is to help achieve a peaceful resolution to the German question, which is of great importance to Czechoslovakia as Germany's immediate neighbor.

　　The appeal states: The historical experience of the Czechoslovak people proves that weapons in the hands of West German militarists are a serious threat to the security of European peoples and world peace.

　　The appeal condemns the absurd claims that the so-called London and Paris Agreements are "defensive" and that ratification of these agreements would not hinder further negotiations. It states: The serious threat that will arise from the ratification of the London and Paris Agreements must be avoided at all costs.

　　The appeal concludes by calling on members of parliament of European countries, in the interests of their countries and peoples, to persistently uphold the cause of peace, to refuse to agree to ratify the London and Paris Agreements, and to resolutely demand that their governments participate in the Pan-European Conference proposed by the Soviet government to be held on November 29, 1954.

    捷克斯洛伐克国民议会外交委员会通过呼吁书
    要求欧洲各国议会议员支持召开全欧会议
    【新华社十八日讯】据塔斯社布拉格十七日讯：捷克斯洛伐克国民议会外交委员会十六日举行会议，讨论苏联政府十三日照会中所提出的以加强和平和欧洲安全为目的的建议。
    会议听取了总理威廉·西罗基的报告，他扼要地说明了政府对苏联照会的看法。
    会议并且通过了一项致欧洲各国议会议员的呼吁书，呼吁各国议员拒绝批准伦敦和巴黎协定，并且要求他们的政府参加苏联建议的全欧会议。
    呼吁书首先指出：捷克斯洛伐克国民议会外交委员会一致赞同捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府决定参加苏联政府建议的在今年十一月二十九日召开的讨论建立欧洲集体安全体系的会议。这个将由所有欧洲国家、美国和中华人民共和国参加的会议符合于捷克斯洛伐克各族人民的切身利益。会议的目的是帮助德国问题的和平解决，这个问题对于作为德国的紧邻的捷克斯洛伐克具有重大的关系。
    呼吁书说：捷克斯洛伐克人民的历史经验证明：武器在西德军国主义分子手里就是对欧洲各国人民的安全和世界和平的严重威胁。
    呼吁书斥责了所谓伦敦和巴黎协定是“防御性”的以及批准这些协定不会妨碍进一步商谈的荒谬说法。它说：必须不惜一切代价来避免因批准伦敦和巴黎协定而将产生的严重威胁。
    呼吁书最后要求欧洲各国议会的议员们，为了他们的国家和人民的利益，坚持不懈地维护和平事业，拒绝同意批准伦敦和巴黎协定，并坚决要求他们的政府参加苏联政府建议在一九五四年十一月二十九日召开的全欧会议。
