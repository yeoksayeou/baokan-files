    Fushun Carbon Black Factory's newly built project for this year has been completed. The Fushun Longfeng Mine is continuing to develop gas roadways to meet the carbon black factory's need for gas.
    Recently, the Fushun Carbon Black Factory, in cooperation with the Changchun Comprehensive Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, has made a new technological contribution by using harmful gas from coal mines to produce carbon black. They are using coal mine gas mixed with naphthalene vapor to trial-produce oil-gasified carbon black. According to preliminary test results, using this method can increase carbon black production by three and a half to five times compared to using pure coal mine gas, and the cost can also be reduced by half.

    抚顺碳黑工厂今年新建工程完工
    抚顺碳黑工厂今年的新建工程完工了。抚顺龙凤矿正在继续开拓瓦斯巷道，以满足碳黑工厂对于瓦斯的需要。
    抚顺碳黑工厂最近和中国科学院长春综合研究所合作，又作出了利用煤矿井下有害的瓦斯来制造碳黑的新的技术贡献。他们用煤矿瓦斯混合萘蒸气来试制油气化碳黑。据初步试验结果，采用这种方法，可以使碳黑产量比用纯粹煤矿瓦斯制造时提高三倍半到五倍，成本也可降低一半。   （新华社）
