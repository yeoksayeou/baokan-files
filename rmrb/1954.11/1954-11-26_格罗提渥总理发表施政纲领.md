    Grotewohl's Government Program Announced
    [Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, November 25th] Grotewohl, Premier of the German Democratic Republic, announced the new government's program in the People's Chamber meeting on the 19th.
    Grotewohl first spoke about the West German rearmament issue, saying that the Paris Agreements are merely a new plan to continue implementing the policies embodied in the "European Defense Community" treaty and to achieve the main goals of this policy. The revival of German militarism ultimately leads to war. Therefore, the German people have a particularly important responsibility to defend peace.
    Grotewohl condemned the agreement on the Saar issue as a deal between German and French monopoly capitalists, and pointed out that a unified, democratic, peaceful, and independent Germany and France can reach a peaceful and permanent understanding on the Saar issue on the basis that the Saar is an indivisible part of German territory, but that French interests in security and economic relations should be taken into account.
    Grotewohl then addressed the issue of German sovereignty. He pointed out that the sovereignty granted by the Soviet Union to the German Democratic Republic in internal and external affairs is fundamentally different from the "sovereignty" granted to West Germany by the Paris Agreements. The sovereignty of the German Democratic Republic serves the restoration of German unity, while the so-called "sovereignty of the Federal Republic" serves to hinder German understanding and to permanently divide Germany. He called on all Germans to fight together to defeat the London and Paris Agreements, which are making West Germany militarize again and preparing for a war of revenge.
    Grotewohl pointed out that building a new, democratic, and peace-loving Germany is the historical mission of the German Democratic Republic. The German Democratic Republic has the necessary internal conditions to accomplish this mission. This country is democratic internally and peaceful externally. It belongs without reservation to the great peace camp. It strives to restore peaceful and friendly relations with the people of other countries in the world.
    Grotewohl also pointed out that restoring German unity is a matter for all the German people. In order to resolve the German issue as soon as possible on a peaceful and democratic basis and to establish a unified, peace-loving, democratic, and independent Germany, the government of the German Democratic Republic believes that the following measures among Germans themselves are urgent and absolutely necessary:
    1.  Abolish the Paris Agreements, prevent the resurgence of West German militarism, and absolutely prohibit this or that part of Germany from participating in aggressive military blocs.
    2.  Prepare for and hold universal, equal, secret, direct, and free all-German elections so that the people of eastern and western Germany can reach an understanding on issues vital to their nation. An important step in this direction is for representatives from both parts of Germany to consult on resolving issues conducive to reunification, especially the normalization of the German situation and the economic, social, and cultural rapprochement between the two parts of Germany.
    3.  The Four Powers reach an agreement on the immediate and simultaneous withdrawal of occupying forces from Germany.
    4.  Participate in the Pan-European Conference according to the suggestions in the Soviet note of November 13, 1954, to discuss the establishment of a European collective security system, and, as suggested in the Soviet government's note to the three Western powers on October 23, 1954, immediately convene a meeting of the Four Foreign Ministers to negotiate the German issue.
    5.  Formulate a peace treaty with Germany with the equal participation of representatives from both parts of Germany or representatives of the all-German government.
    6.  The German people must have the possibility to decide completely freely and without restraint throughout Germany whether to support the Paris Agreements and West Germany's accession to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or to support a peaceful resolution of the German issue and the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany within the overall framework of the European collective security issue.
    Grotewohl then discussed the main tasks in the economic field, pointing out that the government has the responsibility to ensure the further rise of the various economic sectors of the German Democratic Republic in order to ensure the continuous improvement of the living standards of the working people. In the coming years, the total industrial output should be greatly increased further, especially the output of electricity, coal, mining, and chemical industries. The production of high-quality consumer goods must be increased. At the same time, efforts must be made to achieve greater development in agriculture. This requires excellent leading cadres to improve the work of machine tractor stations and state farms, and also requires more attention to cultivating leading cadres of agricultural producers' cooperatives and providing agricultural producers' cooperatives with more loans and better assistance.
    Grotewohl called on all state organs, especially the state-owned enterprise sector, to fulfill the tasks set by the state, and at the same time expressed the hope that farmers, handicraftsmen, and private entrepreneurs would strive to support the government's policies.
    Grotewohl also spoke about cultural policy, and pointed out that the government should maintain close contact with the residents, strengthen the spirit of law-abiding, and greatly develop collective cooperation in state organs at all levels.

    格罗提渥总理发表施政纲领
    【新华社柏林二十五日电】德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥十九日在人民议院会议上发表了新政府的施政纲领。
    格罗提渥首先谈到西德重新武装问题说：巴黎协定只是继续执行“欧洲防务集团”条约所体现的政策和实现这个政策的主要目标的一种新计划。德国军国主义的复活最后的结果就是战争。因此，德国人民对保卫和平有特别重大的责任。
    格罗提渥谴责关于萨尔问题的协定是德法垄断资本家之间的买卖勾当，并且指出一个统一、民主、和平和独立的德国同法国能够在下述基础上求得对萨尔问题的和平而永久的谅解：萨尔是德国领土不可分割的一部分，但是应该照顾法国在安全问题上和经济关系上的利益。
    格罗提渥接着谈到德国主权问题。他指出：苏联给予德意志民主共和国在对内和对外事务上的全部主权，这和巴黎协定规定给予西德的“主权”是根本不同的。德意志民主共和国的主权为恢复德国的统一而服务；而所谓“联邦共和国的主权”是为阻挠德国人彼此谅解并使德国永久分裂而服务的。他号召一切德国人共同斗争，击败使西德重新军国主义化和准备复仇战争的伦敦协定和巴黎协定。
    格罗提渥指出：建立一个新的、民主的、爱好和平的德国是德意志民主共和国的历史使命。德意志民主共和国对于完成这个使命具有必要的内部条件。这个国家对内民主对外和平。它毫无保留地属于伟大的和平阵营。它努力恢复同世界其他国家的人民的和平友好关系。
    格罗提渥还指出：恢复德国统一是全德国人民的事情。为了尽速在和平和民主的基础上解决德国问题和建立统一、爱好和平、民主、独立的德国，德意志民主共和国政府认为：德国人自己之间实行下列措施是不可拖延的和绝对必要的：
    一、废除巴黎协定，阻止西德军国主义再起，绝对不许德国的这部分或那部分参加侵略性的军事集团；
    二、筹备和举行普遍、平等、秘密、直接、自由的全德选举，德国东部和西部的人民就其民族切身问题达成谅解。这方面的重要步骤是：德国两部分的代表协商解决有助于重归统一的各项问题，特别是德国局势正常化的问题以及德国两部分在经济、社会和文化上彼此接近的问题；
    三、四大国就立即同时从德国撤出占领军问题达成协议；
    四、按照一九五四年十一月十三日苏联照会的建议参加全欧会议，来讨论建立欧洲集体安全体系的问题，并且按照一九五四年十月二十三日苏联政府致西方三国的照会所建议的那样，立即召开四大国外长会议谈判德国问题；
    五、在德国两部分的代表或全德政府代表的平等参加之下拟订对德和约；
    六、德国人民必须有可能在全德范围内完全自由、毫无拘束地决定：赞成巴黎协定和西德加入北大西洋公约体系，还是赞成和平解决德国问题并且在欧洲集体安全问题通盘解决的情况下缔结对德和约。
    格罗提渥然后谈到经济方面的主要任务，指出政府有责任保证德意志民主共和国各经济部门进一步高涨，以便保证劳动人民的生活水平不断提高。在今后几年之内，应该进一步大大提高工业总产量，首先是电力、煤、采矿和化学工业部门的产量。品质优良的日用消费品的生产必须提高。同时要努力使农业获得更高的发展。这需要有优秀的领导干部来改善机器拖拉机站和国营农场的工作，也需要更注意培养农业生产合作社的领导干部以及给农业生产合作社以更多的贷款和更好的帮助。
    格罗提渥号召所有国家机关，特别是国营企业部门，完成国家规定的任务，同时希望农民、手工业者和私营企业家努力支持政府的政策。
    格罗提渥还谈到文化政策，并且指出政府要同居民密切联系，要加强守法精神，要在各级国家机关中大大开展集体合作。
