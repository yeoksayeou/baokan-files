Flax Fiber Can Be Used as Raw Material for the Textile Industry

The Ministry of Textile Industry recently succeeded in an experiment processing flax fiber in the Yanbei area, which is rich in flax. In the past, local farmers used flax stalks as fuel. Now, after processing, every 100 jin of flax stalks can produce 12 to 15 jin of fiber, and the tensile strength is suitable for weaving sacks.

This year, Yanbei area had a bumper harvest of 710,000 mu of flax. In addition to producing more than 23 million jin of oil, it is estimated that it can provide the textile industry with at least 3.5 million jin of fiber raw materials. Local farmers can also increase their income by more than 10 billion yuan. (Xinhua News Agency)

    胡麻纤维可作纺织工业原料
    纺织工业部最近在盛产胡麻的雁北地区，进行胡麻纤维加工试验成功。过去当地农民都把胡麻秆当作燃料烧用。现在经过加工，每百斤胡麻秆能出十二斤到十五斤纤维，拉力和强度都适合织麻袋用。
    今年雁北地区七十一万亩胡麻丰收，除产油料二千三百多万斤外，估计最少可给纺织工业提供三百五十多万斤纤维原料。当地农民还可增加一百多亿元收入。（新华社）
