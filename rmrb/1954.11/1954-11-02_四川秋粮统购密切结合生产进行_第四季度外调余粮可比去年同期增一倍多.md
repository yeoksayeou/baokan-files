Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, October 31st: Various regions in Sichuan Province are conducting grain unified purchase work closely integrated with production. Since the grain unified purchase work began in mid-September, the Sichuan Provincial Committees of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Governments at all levels have issued instructions on combining grain unified purchase with production, requiring all counties, districts, and townships to allocate a certain amount of manpower to lead production based on local conditions. Methods such as organizing the masses for regular inspections or launching competitions are to be used to promote production. The CPC Luzhou Prefectural Committee specifically arranged autumn cultivation work before the purchase work began. In the Jiangjin Prefecture, each district and township left a certain number of cadres specifically to lead production during the unified purchase, striving to ensure that neither unified purchase nor production was neglected. Currently, the Jiangjin Prefecture has completed more than 60% of its grain purchase task and more than 80% of its autumn cultivation production.

During the unified purchase, party and government leading departments and cadres sent to carry out grain unified purchase work paid close attention to helping farmers solve problems that needed to be addressed in autumn cultivation and sowing. Many regions transferred large quantities of seeds and fertilizers from grain departments and supply and marketing cooperatives to supply farmers for autumn sowing. In Jiangjin, Luzhou, and other prefectures, local people's governments and grain unified purchase work cadres organized internal adjustments, ensuring that farmers lacking seeds had them; they also established warm water seed soaking stations and held sowing demonstrations for wheat and rapeseed. When deploying the grain unified purchase and sales work, the Neijiang Prefecture set a production increase plan to transform single-season fields into double-season fields and expand the wheat sowing area by 50,000 mu and the rapeseed area by 80,000 mu throughout the prefecture. The Wenjiang Prefecture also promoted improved rapeseed varieties on 350,000 mu. The practice of combining unified purchase and sales with production further encouraged farmers' enthusiasm for selling grain. Ye Yutang, a farmer from Dashi Township in Changshou County, voluntarily sold one stone and one dou of millet to the state because government leadership in drought resistance reduced the threat of autumn drought, resulting in a good harvest of sweet potatoes, taro, and other late-autumn crops.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, October 31st: Sichuan Province plans to increase the surplus grain transferred out in the fourth quarter of this year by more than double compared to the same period last year, accounting for 40% of the total surplus grain transferred out for the year, making it the quarter with the largest outward transfer of surplus grain in history. The number of counties in the province with surplus grain for outward transfer has increased from 89 to 99.

In the fourth quarter, grain departments and transportation units at all levels have listed grain transfer work as an important central task. In the fourth quarter transportation plan of the Chongqing Port Authority, grain transportation accounted for 70%. Grain departments have now successively erected temporary grain warehouses at the Chongqing Railway Station and along the Jialing River to receive large quantities of grain transported from various places.

### 四川秋粮统购密切结合生产进行  第四季度外调余粮可比去年同期增一倍多

    四川秋粮统购密切结合生产进行
    第四季度外调余粮可比去年同期增一倍多
    【新华社成都三十一日电】四川省各地把粮食统购工作和生产密切结合进行。自九月中旬粮食统购工作开始，中共四川省各级委员会和各级人民政府就发出粮食统购和生产结合进行的指示，要求各县、区和各乡必须按当地情况，抽出一定力量领导生产，并用组织群众进行定期检查或开展竞赛等方法，把生产推动起来。中共泸州地委在收购工作开始前，专门布置了秋耕工作。江津专区各区乡在统购进行中留下一定数量的干部专门领导生产，力求做到统购和生产两不误。现在江津专区粮食收购任务已完成百分之六十以上，秋耕生产完成百分之八十以上。
    在统购中，各地党、政领导部门和派出作粮食统购工作的干部，很注意帮助农民解决秋耕秋种中需要解决的问题。许多地区从粮食部门和供销合作社调集大批种籽、肥料供应农民秋种。在江津、泸州等专区，各地人民政府和粮食统购工作干部组织内部相互调剂，使部分缺乏种籽的农民都有了种籽；同时成立了温汤浸种站，并举办了小麦和油菜的播种示范。内江专区在布置粮食统购统销工作时，订出了变一季田为二季田，全专区扩大小麦播种面积五万亩、油菜面积八万亩的增产计划。温江专区还推广良种油菜三十五万亩。统购统销结合生产进行的做法更鼓舞了农民卖粮的积极性。长寿县大石乡农民叶玉堂在统购中由于政府领导抗旱，减除了秋旱威胁，红苕、芋头等晚秋作物收成很好，他于是自愿多卖了一石一斗谷子给国家。
    【新华社重庆三十一日电】四川省今年第四季度计划外调的余粮比去年同期增加一倍多，占全年外调余粮的百分之四十，是历年余粮外调中最多的一个季度。全省有余粮外调的县份由八十九个增加到九十九个。
    第四季度，各级粮食部门和交通运输单位都把调粮工作列为重要的中心工作。重庆港务局第四季度的运输计划中，粮食运输占了百分之七十。粮食部门现已陆续在重庆火车站、嘉陵江边架搭临时粮库，迎接各地运来的大批粮食。
