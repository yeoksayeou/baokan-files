    Chinese Artists Form Study Group
    To Learn from the Soviet State Moscow Musical Theatre

    A Chinese artist study group has been formed to learn from the Soviet State Moscow Musical Theatre, which is currently visiting and performing in Beijing.

    The study group includes musicians, dancers, playwrights, stage artists from various art troupes in the capital, as well as art workers from various regions who have come to Beijing specifically to participate in this study. Zhou Weizhi, Director of the Central Experimental Opera House, serves as the head of the study group. The group is further divided into subgroups for performance, directing, conducting, ballet, chorus, stage art, and theatre management, each engaging in specialized study.

    Since the arrival of the entire Moscow Musical Theatre company in Beijing, the members of the study group have been observing the rehearsals, dress rehearsals, and performances of the Moscow Musical Theatre's operas and ballets. They have also engaged in numerous seminars and individual conversations with the Soviet artists on various artistic issues.

    Starting from the 10th, the study group began inviting artists from the Moscow Musical Theatre to hold report meetings. Bulmester, the general director of ballet of the Moscow Musical Theatre, ballet directors Kholfin and Gusev, opera directors Meltzer, Keimarskaya, and Kamernitsky, and others gave systematic reports to the Chinese art workers on the artistic creation issues of opera and ballet. They also answered questions raised by the Chinese literary and art workers at the meetings. Each report meeting was attended by more than 500 people.

    The study group also invited Soviet artists to appreciate the performances of Chinese artists separately, and then held seminars on these performances. On the 9th, the entire staff of the Moscow Musical Theatre watched the Chinese opera "Liu Hulan"; on the 13th, Stepanov, the general conductor of the Moscow Musical Theatre Choir, and others listened to the choir of the Central Song and Dance Troupe; on the 14th and 15th, Slavinsky, the general conductor of the Moscow Musical Theatre Orchestra, and others listened to the performances of the Central Song and Dance Troupe Orchestra and the Central Experimental Opera House Orchestra respectively. The Soviet artists offered valuable suggestions for improvement on these performances. Stepanov also guided the Central Song and Dance Troupe Choir in rehearsing the peasant chorus from the opera "Eugene Onegin." (Xinhua News Agency)

    我国艺术家组成学习组
    向苏联国立莫斯科音乐剧院学习
    我国艺术家组成学习组，向正在北京访问演出的苏联国立莫斯科音乐剧院进行学习。
    参加学习组的有首都各艺术团体的音乐家、舞蹈家、戏剧家、舞台美术家和各地专门来北京参加这次学习的艺术工作者。学习组由中央实验歌剧院院长周巍峙担任组长，组内又分为表演、导演、指挥、舞剧、合唱、舞台美术、剧院领导工作等各组，分别进行专业学习。
    从莫斯科音乐剧院全体人员到达北京后，学习组的成员就开始观摩莫斯科音乐剧院歌剧和舞剧的排练、总排和演出，还就各种艺术问题和苏联艺术家进行了多次的座谈和个别交谈。
    十日起，学习组开始邀请莫斯科音乐剧院艺术家举行报告会的活动。莫斯科音乐剧院舞剧总导演布尔梅斯杰尔，舞剧导演霍尔芬、古谢夫，歌剧导演麦尔泽、凯玛尔斯卡娅、卡麦尔尼茨基等分别就歌剧和舞剧的艺术创作问题对我国艺术工作者作了系统的报告，并在会上解答了我国文艺工作者提出的问题。每次报告会都有五百多人参加。
    学习组还分别邀请苏联艺术家欣赏我国艺术家的表演，然后就这些表演举行座谈。九日，莫斯科音乐剧院全体人员观看了我国歌剧“刘胡兰”；十三日，音乐剧院合唱团总指挥斯捷潘诺夫等听了中央歌舞团合唱队的合唱；十四日和十五日，莫斯科音乐剧院乐队总指挥斯拉文斯基等分别听了中央歌舞团乐队、中央实验歌剧院管弦乐团的演奏。苏联艺术家们曾对这些表演提出了宝贵的改进意见，斯捷潘诺夫还指导中央歌舞团合唱队练唱了歌剧“叶夫根尼·奥涅金”中的农民合唱。（新华社）
