    Youth from the Capital and Soviet Youth in Beijing Hold a Joint Celebration
    The youth of the capital and Soviet youth in Beijing held a friendly get-together on the evening of the 8th at the Cultural Center of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in Beijing to celebrate the 37th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution. More than 400 people attended the get-together, including workers, students, soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, cadres of government offices from the capital, and Soviet students and expatriates in Beijing. Some young actors from the Moscow State Musical Theater of the Soviet Union also participated in the get-together.
    Zhang Dazhong, Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Democratic Youth Federation, and representatives of the Soviet youth spoke at the gathering.
    Youth from China and the Soviet Union performed many artistic programs at the get-together, including solo singing, chorus, and red silk dance. Borisova's solo "Lovely Little Grass" and Matveyev's rendition of "Russia" from the Moscow State Musical Theater of the Soviet Union won enduring applause from the audience. When Matveyev excitedly sang "The Song of the Chinese People's Volunteers" in Chinese, the whole audience followed him in singing "Valiantly and spiritedly…". Chinese youth also recited Mayakovsky's "Soviet Passport" at the get-together.
    The young people sang and danced until late at night, and the evening ended with the joyful song "Moscow-Beijing." (Xinhua News Agency)

    首都青年和在京的苏联青年举行联欢会
    首都青年和在京的苏联青年，八日在北京市中苏友好协会文化馆举行友谊联欢晚会，庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命三十七周年。参加联欢会的有首都的工人、学生、人民解放军战士、机关干部和在京的苏联留学生及侨民等共四百多人。苏联国立莫斯科音乐剧院的部分青年演员也参加了联欢会。
    北京市民主青年联合会主席张大中和苏联青年的代表在联欢会上讲话。
    中苏两国青年在联欢会上表演了独唱、合唱、红绸舞等很多文艺节目。苏联国立莫斯科音乐剧院波里索娃的独唱“可爱的小草”和马特维也夫演唱的“俄罗斯”博得了全场经久不息的掌声。当马特维也夫兴奋地用中国话唱“中国人民志愿军战歌”时，全场都跟着他“雄赳赳，气昂昂……”高唱起来。中国青年在联欢会上也朗诵了马雅柯夫斯基的“苏联护照”。
    青年们歌舞到深夜，晚会最后在欢乐的“莫斯科—北京”的歌声中结束。  （新华社）
