    Geological Survey Teams Discover Many Mineral Resources
    [By our newspaper] This year's large-scale mineral prospecting work across the country has achieved remarkable results. In June of this year, the Ministry of Geology dispatched more than 40 mineral prospecting teams composed of graduating students from various geological institutes and departments. Over the past few months, the team members have traveled to 120 counties and more than 280 mineral locations in 19 provinces and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, discovering many valuable mineral resources. In the Northwest region, a certain iron mine, which had been investigated several times in the past and considered a valueless limonite deposit, has now been identified as a black metal ore needed for smelting high-grade alloy steel in our country. A certain manganese mine, which was previously considered to be of low quality and of little value, now shows signs of potentially being a large copper deposit of the copper-bearing pyrite type. In a certain area of Gansu Province, a large coalfield has been discovered, which is of great significance for solving the urgent fuel needs of industrial construction and transportation in Gansu Province. In the Southwest region, the survey teams discovered comprehensive mining areas with several metallic ore bodies and abundant reserves. Not far from the mining area, there is also a coalfield with good quality coal. In the Central South region, several ore deposits with exploration prospects have been discovered and inspected, including two non-ferrous metal ores and one ferrous metal ore, all of which are large-scale and widely distributed deposits. Another coalfield discovered contains a large amount of bauxite, the raw material for aluminum refining, at the bottom of the coal seam, which greatly increases the value of this coalfield. The prospecting team composed of the Northeast Geological Bureau discovered a currently the largest ultramafic rock mass in our country in a certain area of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Dozens of ferrous metal ore bodies and previously undiscovered ore-bearing weathered crust deposits were found in this rock mass. This raises the possibility and clues for finding ore-bearing weathered crust in our country in the future. In the North China region, a coalfield with various types of industrial coal has been found, with a large area, multiple and thick coal seams, and good coal quality. In both the Northeast and East China, molybdenum deposits with good exploration prospects have been found this time. In addition, a huge phosphate deposit that can be used as mineral fertilizer has been discovered in the Northeast. Phosphate deposits have also been successively discovered in the Southwest, Northwest, and East China regions.
    In addition to discovering many valuable mineral locations, this prospecting work has also grasped and solved the geological structure of several regions, pointing out the direction for future mineral prospecting in these regions. During the work process, the students participating in the prospecting learned practical field work methods and learned how to conduct mineral evaluation work. Currently, the prospecting teams are working actively to provide design data for prospecting and exploration next year.

    地质普查队探明许多矿产资源
   【本报讯】今年全国大规模的矿产普查工作已取得显著成绩。今年六月间，地质部先后派出了由各地质院系本年暑期应届毕业生参加的四十多个矿产普查队。几个月来，普查队的队员走遍十九个省和内蒙古自治区的一百二十个县、二百八十多个矿产地，探明了许多有价值的矿产资源。在西北地区，某地的一个铁矿，过去经过了若干次调查，认为是没有价值的褐铁矿床，但这次普查探明它是我国目前冶炼高级合金钢所需要的黑色金属矿。某地有一个过去认为品质低劣价值不大的锰矿，现在，也有迹象证明可能是一个巨大的含铜黄铁矿类型的铜矿床。在甘肃省某地，发现了一处面积很大的煤田，这块煤田对解决目前甘肃省工业建设和交通所急需用的燃料有很重大的意义。在西南地区，普查队发现了有几种金属矿体而埋藏量又很丰富的综合矿区。离矿区不远，还有一处煤质很好的煤田。在中南地区，发现和检查出了几个有勘探前途的矿床，其中两个有色金属矿和一个黑色金属矿，都是规模大、分布面积广的矿床。另外发现的一处煤田，煤层底部还藏有大量的炼铝原料——铝土矿，这就大大提高了这块煤田的价值。由东北地质局组成的普查队，在内蒙古自治区某地发现了一块目前我国最大的超基性岩体，在这块岩体内找到了几十个黑色金属矿体和过去从未发现过的含矿风化壳矿床。这就提出了今后在我国找寻含矿风化壳的可能性及其线索。在华北地区，找到一处有各种工业用煤的煤田，而且面积广，煤层多而厚，煤质好。在东北和华东，这次都找到了很有勘探前途的钼矿床。此外，在东北还发现了一个巨大的可作矿物肥料的磷矿床。西南、西北、华东等地也都相继发现了磷矿床。
    这次普查工作除探明许多有价值的矿产地外，还掌握和解决了若干地区的地质构造，给今后这些地区的矿产普查指出了方向。参加普查工作的学生在工作过程中，学会了野外实际工作操作方法，知道怎样进行矿产评价工作。目前各普查队正在积极工作，以便为明年的普查和勘探提出设计资料。
