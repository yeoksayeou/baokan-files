Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, November 12th: President Sukarno's speech in Palembang on the 9th, condemning reactionary elements engaged in treasonous activities, has aroused widespread reaction in Indonesia.

At a mass rally held in Jakarta on the 10th to commemorate Indonesian Heroes' Day, a resolution was passed demanding that resolute measures be taken to eliminate all subversive groups. The resolution pointed out that these groups are enemies of the Republic of Indonesia. The resolution also expressed opposition to all activities hindering the smooth progress of the general election, supported the government's initiative for the Asian-African Conference, and supported the government's efforts to recover West Irian. Speakers at the meeting included representatives of the Indonesian Political Party and Group Consultation Committee, Mayor Sudiro, and youth representatives. They all emphasized the importance of national unity in the continued struggle against imperialism. They believe that imperialists and big capitalists, with the help of anti-national and reactionary Indonesians, are creating dangers for Indonesia both at home and abroad.

Sunjoto, chairman of the Greater Indonesian Party's parliamentary group, also spoke to the press about Sukarno's speech. He said that the leading figures whom the president denounced should be arrested and punished because their actions are tantamount to subversive activities aimed at overthrowing the country.

Indonesian newspapers have attached great importance to Sukarno's speech. On the 11th, many newspapers published commentaries advocating the punishment of those reactionary elements who betray the country.

"People's Daily" wrote that the entire people support President Sukarno's speech, which exposed the opposition leaders who sold out national interests to foreign imperialism.

"Indonesia News" called for immediate and resolute measures to be taken against these traitors who betray the country.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, November 12th: Indonesian President Sukarno told reporters from the Indonesian News Agency (formerly Aneta News Agency) on the 10th: "We know that there are some leading figures who want to sell our country to foreigners for millions of dollars. They can do this without legal prosecution. The reason we cannot prosecute them is that the money they obtain is always acquired in a 'democratic' manner. They are conducting active propaganda and trying to influence the country's political structure in some way. In this regard, they are supporting foreigners who want to subvert the government in an effort to push Indonesia's policies in a certain direction."

Sukarno said that this trick is played very cunningly in order to escape legal sanctions. He said: "We can only condemn them morally now."

Sukarno said that he had known about this situation for a long time, but had never had a better and more opportune opportunity to expose it as he does now.

Sukarno said: "I am making this revelation to warn those who commit crimes, so that they know that we have seen through their immoral tricks."

    印度尼西亚各界要求惩办出卖国家的叛徒
    苏加诺总统再次指责反动分子的卖国活动
    【新华社雅加达十二日电】印度尼西亚总统苏加诺九日在巨港发表的谴责反动分子从事卖国活动的演说，在印度尼西亚引起了广泛的反应。
    十日在雅加达举行的纪念印度尼西亚英雄日的群众大会上，通过了要求采取断然措施肃清一切颠覆集团的决议。决议指出，这些集团是印度尼西亚共和国的敌人。决议并表示反对阻挠大选顺利进行的一切活动，支持政府发起的亚非会议和支持政府收回西伊里安的努力。在这个大会上发言的有印度尼西亚政党团体协商委员会的代表、市长苏迪罗和青年代表。他们都着重指出在继续进行反对帝国主义的斗争中民族团结的重要性。他们认为，帝国主义者和大资本家在反民族的、反动的印度尼西亚人的帮助下，在国内和国外给印度尼西亚制造了危险。
    大印度尼西亚党国会党团主席松佐托也就苏加诺的演说向报界发表了谈话。他说，应该把总统所斥责的那些领袖分子拘捕起来，并加以处分，因为他们的行动等于是推翻国家的颠覆活动。
    印度尼西亚报纸都很重视苏加诺的演说，十一日，许多报纸发表评论，主张惩办那些出卖国家的反动分子。
    “人民日报”写道，全体人民都拥护苏加诺总统的演说，他的演说揭发了出卖国家利益给外国帝国主义的反对派领袖们。
      “印度尼西亚新闻”要求立即对这些出卖国家的叛徒采取坚决的措施。
   【新华社雅加达十二日电】印度尼西亚总统苏加诺十日对印度尼西亚新闻社（前为安尼塔通讯社）记者发表谈话说：“我们知道，现在有一些领袖人物为了百万金钱而想把我们的国家出卖给外国人。这件事，他们做得可以不受法律检举。我们之所以不能够检举他们，是因为他们所获得的金钱一直是用‘民主的’方式取得的。他们正在进行积极的宣传，并设法用某种方法来影响国家的政治结构。他们在这方面正在支持那些想颠覆政府的外国人，以竭力把印度尼西亚的政策推到某一个方向去。”
    苏加诺说，这个把戏玩得很狡猾，以便逃避法律的制裁。他说：“我们现在只能从道义上谴责他们。”
    苏加诺说，他早已知道这种情况，但是一直没有像现在这样较好的和比较合乎时宜的机会来加以揭露。
    苏加诺说：“我作这样的揭露，是为了警告那些犯罪的人，使他们知道我们已看透了他们那种违反道德的伎俩。”
