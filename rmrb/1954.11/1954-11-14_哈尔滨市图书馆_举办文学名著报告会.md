    Harbin Library
    Holds Report Meetings on Famous Literary Works
    The Harbin Library began holding report meetings on famous literary works in May of this year. To date, a total of nineteen reports have been given, with a total audience of 4,195 people. The report meetings are led by heads of Harbin's literary and art departments, writers, teachers, and others. The literary masterpieces that have been discussed include "How Steel Was Tempered," "Happiness," "Virgin Soil Upturned," "Dream of the Red Chamber," and sixteen others. Depending on the different requirements of the audience, some reports emphasize explaining the noble ideological qualities of the protagonists in the works, so that the audience can actively learn from them; others conduct a systematic analysis of a certain work, pointing out the theme, organizational structure, and writing techniques of the work, in order to improve the audience's interest in and appreciation of literature and art. These report meetings have been warmly welcomed by the audience. Many factory workers, after listening to the reports on works such as "How Steel Was Tempered," have expressed their determination to learn from the protagonists in the works.

  “红楼梦”等十六种。报告会根据听众不同要求，有的是强调讲解作品中主人翁的崇高思想品质，以便使听众积极向他们学习；有的是对某一作品进行系统的分析，指出作品主题思想、组织结构和写作技巧，以便提高听众对文艺的兴趣和欣赏水平。这些报告会受到听众的热烈欢迎。许多工厂的工人们听了“钢铁是怎样炼成的”等作品的报告后，都表示决心向作品中的主人翁学习。
