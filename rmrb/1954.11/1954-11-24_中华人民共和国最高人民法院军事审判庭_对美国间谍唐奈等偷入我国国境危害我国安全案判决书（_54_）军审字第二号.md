The above eleven defendants were prosecuted by Yao Lun, Military Procurator of the Supreme People's Procurate of the People's Republic of China, for the crime of illegally entering Chinese territory by plane to carry out espionage activities endangering our country's security and betraying the motherland. Based on the trial materials, this court has ascertained:

The defendant, John Thomas Downey, joined the Central Intelligence Agency, an American spy organization, in June 1951. In December of the same year, he was sent by the American CIA to work at the Atsugi spy organization in Japan. The defendant, Richard George Fectau, joined the Central Intelligence Agency, an American spy organization, in June 1952. In October of the same year, he was sent by the American CIA to work at the Atsugi spy organization in Japan. They had both received specialized training in conducting terror and sabotage and armed rebellion against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. In the spring of 1952, John Thomas Downey and another American spy, under the orders of the head of the Atsugi spy organization, selected the special agents Li Junying, Zhang Zaiwen, Xu Guangzhi, Yu Guanzhou, Luan Hengshan, Wang Jinsheng, and others from the CIA's Saipan Island spy training facility and brought them to a secret training camp established by the Atsugi spy organization in Chigasaki City, Japan, for training. They also transferred Wang Weifan and radio operators Niu Songlin and Zhong Dianxin from other CIA spy technical training facilities. The defendants Zhang Zaiwen, Xu Guangzhi, Yu Guanzhou, and Niu Songlin were organized into the "Wen Team" and secretly landed in Jilin Province, Northeast China, in July 1952 using a C-47 type American aircraft. Luan Hengshan, Wang Weifan, Wang Jinsheng, and Zhong Dianxin were organized into the "Shen Team" and secretly landed in Liaoning Province, Northeast China, in September of the same year using a B-17 type American aircraft. In addition, Li Junying was dispatched in October of the same year, landing secretly in Jilin Province, China, by American aircraft to conduct liaison and sabotage activities. John Thomas Downey also personally infiltrated Jilin Province, China, by American aircraft in August 1952 to airdrop food and supplies to the "Wen Team" special agents who had landed in Jilin Province. Finally, he and the defendant Richard George Fectau infiltrated the airspace of Northeast China on the night of November 29, 1952, aboard a C-47 type American aircraft, to make contact again and provide support to the special agents who had landed in Chinese territory, and attempted to retrieve the special agent Li Junying from the air in order to report on the work situation, so as to continue to parachute large numbers of special agents into China. That night, the aircraft was shot down by our troops, and the defendants John Thomas Downey and Richard George Fectau were arrested on the spot.

The defendants Zhang Zaiwen, Xu Guangzhi, Yu Guanzhou, Niu Songlin, Luan Hengshan, Wang Weifan, Wang Jinsheng, Zhong Dianxin, Li Junying, and the other nine were all former officers of the Chiang bandit army who participated in the anti-people civil war. After the Chiang bandit army collapsed, they fled to Hong Kong. In 1951, they were successively recruited by the American spy organization "Free China Movement" in Hong Kong. Using the guise of being hired by the "Far East Reclamation Company" to work in Guam, they were sent in batches by plane to the American CIA spy training facilities in Chigasaki City, Kanagawa Prefecture, and Saipan Island for secret training. The training content mainly included espionage techniques such as assassination, demolition, armed rebellion, intelligence gathering, and secret communication within China. After receiving this training, they were selected by the defendant John Thomas Downey and another American spy, and under the direction of the defendant Downey, they were trained, formed into teams, and successively landed in Jilin Province and Liaoning Province in Northeast China by American aircraft. Their mission was to establish armed special agent "bases," protect special agent "safe houses," accept supplies and airdrop special agents at "airdrop sites," and establish secret transportation lines from the "bases" to Shenyang within Northeast China; to collect information on China's defense facilities, industrial target locations, and meteorological information; to rescue downed American air force personnel who had intruded into our country and to recruit remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to carry out armed rebellions. Li Junying's mission was to inspect the activities of the "Wen Team" after landing and to carry out liaison and sabotage work. The above defendants were also captured by us successively.

After the defendants were arrested, they all confessed to the aforementioned facts, and there is evidence in the form of various weapons, ammunition, radios, maps, parachutes, equipment for airdropping special agents, forged People's Liberation Army passports, wounded veteran certificates, passes, and various tools and gold and banknotes used for espionage activities. Therefore, the defendants, in order to realize the American aggressors' plot to expand aggression against China and undermine the Chinese people's democratic cause, entered Chinese territory by parachute from aircraft to engage in espionage activities, seriously endangering China's national security. The evidence is conclusive and there is no doubt.

The defendant John Thomas Downey actively recruited, trained, and dispatched special agents to secretly parachute into Chinese territory by aircraft to carry out sabotage activities, and personally infiltrated China by aircraft to carry out criminal activities, making him the principal offender in this case and should be severely punished. The defendant Richard George Fectau assisted John Thomas Downey in invading Chinese territory and engaging in espionage activities and should also be severely punished. The defendants Xu Guangzhi, Wang Weifan, Wang Jinsheng, Yu Guanzhou and others betrayed the motherland, joined American spy organizations, and, under the direction of American spy organizations, landed in Chinese territory by aircraft to engage in espionage and sabotage activities, endangering national security. Their crimes are serious and they should all be severely punished according to law. The crimes of the defendants Zhang Zaiwen, Luan Hengshan, Zhong Dianxin, Li Junying, and Niu Songlin are as serious as those of the above defendants, but the defendants Zhang Zaiwen, Luan Hengshan, Zhong Dianxin, and Li Junying have shown remorse during the interrogation and are given a relatively lighter sentence at the discretion of the court. The defendant Niu Songlin was able to sincerely repent during the interrogation and is therefore given a lighter punishment. Now, based on the provisions of Articles 6, 3, 7, 11, 14, and 16 of the Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Punishment of Counterrevolutionaries, the judgment is as follows:

I. The defendant JOHN THOMAS DOWNEY is sentenced to life imprisonment.

II. The defendant RICHARD GEORGE FECTEAU is sentenced to 20 years imprisonment.

III. The defendants Xu Guangzhi, Yu Guanzhou, Wang Weifan, and Wang Jinsheng are all sentenced to death; and deprived of political rights for life.

IV. The defendants Zhang Zaiwen, Luan Hengshan, Zhong Dianxin, and Li Junying are all sentenced to life imprisonment; and deprived of political rights for life.

V. The defendant Niu Songlin is sentenced to 15 years imprisonment; and deprived of political rights for 10 years.

VI. All weapons, ammunition, radios, maps, parachutes, and airdrop equipment seized in the case are confiscated.

                                    Judge of the Military Tribunal of the Supreme People's Court of the People's Republic of China: Jia Qian
                                             Judge: Zhu Yaotang
                                             Judge: Zhang Xiangqian

    上列十一名被告因乘用飞机偷入中国国境进行特务活动危害我国安全和背叛祖国案，经中华人民共和国最高人民检察院军事检察员姚伦提起公诉。本庭根据审理材料，查明：
    被告约翰·托马斯·唐奈于一九五一年六月参加美国间谍机关中央情报局，同年十二月被美国中央情报局派至该局驻日本厚木间谍机关工作。被告理查德·乔治·费克图于一九五二年六月参加美国间谍机关中央情报局，同年十月被美国中央情报局派到该局驻日本厚木间谍机关工作。他们都先后受过对苏联和人民民主国家进行恐怖破坏、武装暴乱的专门训练。约翰·托马斯·唐奈于一九五二年春与另一美国间谍分子，受该厚木间谍机关负责人之命，从美国中央情报局的塞班岛间谍训练机构中挑选了被告李军英、张载文、许广智、于冠洲、栾衡山、王金声等特务分子，带到日本厚木间谍机关在茅崎市所设的秘密训练营加以训练，并从美国中央情报局的其他间谍技术训练机构中调来王维藩和电台人员牛松林、钟殿馨等，将被告张载文、许广智、于冠洲和牛松林等编为“文队”，于一九五二年七月以C—47型美国飞机秘密降落于我国东北吉林省；另将栾衡山、王维藩、王金声和钟殿馨等编为“沈队”，于同年九月以B—17型美国飞机秘密降落在我国东北辽宁省。此外，又派李军英于同年十月乘美国飞机秘密降落我吉林省，进行联络和破坏活动。约翰·托马斯·唐奈并曾亲自于一九五二年八月乘美国飞机潜入我吉林省，给降落于吉林省的“文队”特务分子空投粮食和物资，最后又与被告理查德·乔治·费克图于一九五二年十一月二十九日晚乘C—47型美国飞机潜入我国东北领空，再次联络和接济降落在我国境内的特务分子，并企图将特务分子李军英从空中取回以便汇报工作情况，借以继续对中国降落大批特务分子。当晚该机被我部队击落，被告约翰·托马斯·唐奈和理查德·乔治·费克图当时被我逮捕。
    被告张载文、许广智、于冠洲、牛松林、栾衡山、王维藩、王金声、钟殿馨、李军英等九人原都是蒋贼军官，曾参加反人民的内战，蒋贼军溃散后，逃往香港，于一九五一年先后为美国在香港的间谍组织“自由中国运动”所搜罗，以“远东垦业公司”雇用到关岛作工为掩护，将他们分批以飞机送到日本神奈川县茅崎市和塞班岛的美国中央情报局间谍训练机构，受秘密训练。训练内容主要是如何在中国国内进行暗杀、爆破、武装暴乱、刺探情报和秘密通讯等间谍特务技术。他们受了这些训练之后，即经被告约翰·托马斯·唐奈和另一美国间谍分子挑选，在被告唐奈主持下进行训练，分别编队，先后乘美国飞机降落在我国东北吉林省和辽宁省境内，任务是在我国东北境内建立武装特务的“根据地”、掩护特务的“安全处所”、接受补给和空降特务的“空投场”、和从“根据地”到沈阳的秘密交通线，搜集我国国防设备、工业地区目标和气象情报；救护入侵的美国空军被击落人员和搜罗蒋介石卖国集团残余分子进行武装暴乱。李军英的任务是视察“文队”降落后的活动情况，并进行联络和破坏工作。以上被告等亦被我先后捕获。
    各被告经逮捕后，对前开事实均供认不讳，并有获案的各种武器、弹药、电台、地图、降落伞、空投特务的器材和伪造的中国人民解放军护照、负伤纪念证、通行证以及供进行特务活动使用的各种工具和黄金、纸币等为证。因此，被告等为了实现美国侵略者对中国扩大侵略、破坏中国人民民主事业的阴谋，乘用飞机空降中国境内，进行特务活动，严重地危害了中国国家安全，罪证确凿，已无疑义。
    被告约翰·托马斯·唐奈积极搜罗、训练和派遣特务分子乘用飞机秘密空投中国境内进行破坏活动，并且亲自乘飞机潜入中国实施罪恶活动，为本案首要罪犯，应从重惩处。被告理查德·乔治·费克图协助约翰·托马斯·唐奈侵入中国境内，进行间谍特务活动，亦应严惩。被告许广智、王维藩、王金声、于冠洲等背叛祖国，参加美国间谍组织，受美国间谍组织指使，乘用飞机，降落中国境内，进行特务破坏等活动，危害国家安全，罪情严重，均应依法严惩。被告张载文、栾衡山、钟殿馨、李军英、牛松林等罪行与以上被告同样严重，但被告张载文、栾衡山、钟殿馨、李军英等在审讯中有悔过表现，酌予较轻判处，被告牛松林在审讯中，尚能真诚悔过，因而予以从轻处罚。现分别依据中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例第六条、第三条、第七条、第十一条、第十四条、第十六条之规定判决如下：
　　一、被告约翰·托马斯·唐奈（JOHN THOMASDOWNEY）判处无期徒刑。
　　二、被告理查德·乔治·费克图（RICHARD GE-ORGE FECTEAU）判处徒刑二十年。
　　三、被告许广智、于冠洲、王维藩、王金声均判处死刑；并剥夺政治权利终身。
　　四、被告张载文、栾衡山、钟殿馨、李军英均判处无期徒刑；并剥夺政治权利终身。
　　五、被告牛松林判处徒刑十五年；并剥夺政治权利十年。
　　六、获案的各种武器、弹药、电台、地图、降落伞及空降器材等均予没收。
