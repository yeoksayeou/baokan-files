Xinhua News Agency, November 11th: The US government estimates that the total retail sales of goods in the United States in October this year was 14.6 billion US dollars, a decrease of 329 million US dollars compared to the same month last year, according to an Associated Press report. October of last year was already the third month of continuous decline in US economic activity.

In addition, the inventory situation, which can largely reflect the retail situation, has not improved. According to figures released by the US Department of Commerce, the US industrial and commercial inventory at the end of September was 77.4 billion US dollars, an increase of 90 million US dollars compared to the end of August.

    美国商品零售状况不好
    【新华社讯】据美联社十一日报道：美国政府估计，今年十月份美国的商品零售总额为一百四十六亿美元，比去年同月份减少了三亿二千九百万美元。去年十月份已经是美国经济活动开始连续下降的第三个月了。
    此外，在很大程度上可以反映零售状况的存货状况，也未见改善。根据美国商务部公布的数字，九月底的美国工商业存货是七百七十四亿美元，比八月底增加了九千万美元。
