Credit cooperative organizations in Shanxi Province have developed vigorously this year. By the end of this year, more than 72% of all townships in the province will have established credit cooperatives.

Credit cooperatives in Shanxi Province began to be established under the leadership of the Party as early as during the War of Resistance Against Japan. In recent years, especially after the publicity of the general task of the state during the transition period, the credit cooperative cause in the province has developed rapidly. At the end of 1953, there were 1,824 credit cooperatives in the province. By the end of June this year, the number of credit cooperatives in the province had increased to 3,419. At the beginning of July, the first Shanxi Provincial Credit Cooperative Representative Conference decided that the province would build another 1,155 new credit cooperatives in the second half of this year. After the completion of this plan, the number of credit cooperatives in the province will reach 4,574, accounting for more than 72% of the total number of townships in the province, with an average of one credit cooperative for every 1.38 townships. In various counties in Jinan and other places, basically every township will have a cooperative. According to a recent inspection, in the three months of July, August, and September, various counties have newly established 635 credit cooperatives in the process of consolidating old cooperatives. At present, there are 4,054 credit cooperatives in the province, with a total of 2.98 million members and more than 88 billion yuan in share capital.

Credit cooperatives in Shanxi Province have played a significant role in supporting production and combating usury. For example, in August this year, the first Shanxi Provincial People's Congress passed a resolution requiring that, on the basis of completing this year's agricultural production plan, an agricultural production increase campaign be launched with the goal of increasing grain production by four to seven jin per mu of autumn fields and increasing ginned cotton production by ten jin per mu. Credit cooperatives in various parts of the province cooperated with this campaign and issued a total of more than 26 billion yuan in loans, helping farmers buy more than 7 million jin of fertilizer, more than 10,000 jin of seeds, more than 26,000 jin of pesticides, more than 29,000 pieces of agricultural tools, and transferred and purchased more than 11,000 head of draft animals. In addition, they also helped 4,542 farmers solve difficulties in weddings, funerals, and illnesses, thus powerfully supporting the development of this campaign.

The broad masses of farmers in Shanxi Province love credit cooperatives. They affectionately call credit cooperatives "their own small bank." They say that landlords, unscrupulous merchants, and usurers are "the three knives that kill farmers in the old society," and agricultural production cooperatives, supply and marketing cooperatives, and credit cooperatives are "the three treasures that save farmers in the new society." Farmers are very enthusiastic about joining credit cooperatives. In August alone, more than 330,000 people in the province joined credit cooperatives, expanding share capital by more than 12.1 billion yuan and absorbing more than 5 million yuan in deposits. According to statistics from the Shanxi Branch of the People's Bank of China, credit cooperatives in the province absorbed a cumulative total of more than 259.7 billion yuan in deposits from January to September and issued 227.8 billion yuan in loans. The amount of loans issued is equivalent to the total amount of agricultural loans issued by the state during the same period.

In the work of developing credit cooperative organizations in Shanxi Province, the method of taking agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation organizations as the center to drive individual farmers to establish cooperatives has been adopted, so that the development of credit cooperatives is closely combined with the agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation movement. In order to take care of the difficulties of poor farmers in paying share capital, Shanxi Province has adopted the methods of "joining the cooperative first and then paying share capital" and "paying share capital in installments." As a result, many poor farmers feel even more that credit cooperatives are truly their own organizations, so they actively join the cooperatives. In the process of establishing cooperatives, some areas mobilized people to join the cooperatives and raise shares, while at the same time absorbing mass deposits and issuing loans, so that credit cooperatives began to carry out business activities as soon as they were established, helping the masses solve difficulties in production and life. In this way, the masses experienced the role and benefits of credit cooperatives from concrete facts, and credit cooperatives were established, expanded, and improved more quickly. The credit cooperatives in Baijiazhuang and other five townships in Xing County were established in this way. While absorbing share capital, they absorbed more than 3.4 million yuan in deposits and issued more than 27 million yuan in loans, helping farmers solve the difficulties of lacking agricultural tools, seeds, and rations, and were warmly supported by the farmers. In August alone, these five cooperatives expanded and absorbed 1,539 new members.

In August and September, various counties in Shanxi Province convened credit cooperative conferences and formulated specific plans for developing credit cooperatives this winter. At present, various places are actively carrying out winter cooperative construction work. (Report from our newspaper's Shanxi reporter station)

    山西省各地信用合作组织蓬勃发展
    今年年底全省百分之七十二的乡都将建立起信用合作社
    山西省的信用合作社今年有很大发展，到今年年底，全省百分之七十二以上的乡都将建立起信用合作社。
    山西省的信用合作社，远在抗日战争期间，就在党的领导下开始建立起来。近几年来，特别是经过国家过渡时期总任务的宣传以后，全省的信用合作事业有了飞跃的发展。一九五三年底，全省有一千八百二十四个信用合作社，到今年六月底止，全省信用合作社已发展到三千四百一十九个。七月初，该省第一届信用合作社代表会议确定今年下半年全省要再新建一千一百五十五个信用合作社。这个计划完成以后，全省的信用合作社将达到四千五百七十四个，占全省乡数的百分之七十二以上，平均每一点三八个乡就有一个信用合作社。晋南等地各县，将基本上达到乡乡有社。据最近检查，在七、八、九三个月内，各县在整顿老社的过程中，已经新建立起六百三十五个信用合作社。目前，全省已有四千零五十四个信用合作社，共拥有二百九十八万社员，八百八十多亿元股金。
    山西省的信用合作社在扶助生产、打击高利贷活动等方面起了很大作用。如今年八月间，山西省第一届人民代表大会会议上通过决议，要求在完成今年农业生产计划的基础上，以每亩秋田再增产粮食四斤到七斤、增产籽棉十斤为目标，开展农业增产运动。全省各地的信用合作社配合这一运动，共发放贷款二百六十多亿元，帮助农民买到七百多万斤肥料、一万多斤种籽、二万六千多斤农药、二万九千多件农具，并调换和买进了一万一千多头耕畜，另外，还帮助四千五百四十二户农民解决了婚丧、疾病中的困难，因而有力地支持了这一运动的开展。
    山西省广大农民都热爱信用合作社。他们亲热地把信用合作社叫作“自己的小银行”；他们说地主、奸商和高利贷者是“旧社会里杀农民的三把刀”，农业生产合作社、供销合作社和信用合作社是“新社会里救农民的三件宝”。农民们要求参加信用合作社的热情很高，仅八月份，全省就有三十三万多人参加了信用合作社，扩大股金一百二十一亿余元，吸收存款五百多万元。据中国人民银行山西省分行统计，全省信用合作社在一月到九月份，吸收存款累计达二千五百九十七亿余元，放款二千二百七十八亿余元；放款数额，相当于同时期国家发放农业贷款的总额。
    山西省在发展信用合作组织的工作中，采取了以农业生产互助合作组织为中心，带动个体农民建社的办法，使信用合作社的发展紧紧地同农业生产互助合作运动结合在一起。为了照顾贫苦农民缴纳股金的困难，山西省采取了“先入社，后缴股金”和“分期缴纳股金”的办法，许多贫苦农民因此更加感到信用合作社真正是自己的组织，于是踊跃入社。有些地区在建社过程中一面动员入社集股，一面就吸收群众存款和发放贷款，使信用合作社一开始建立就展开业务活动，帮助群众解决生产和生活中的困难。这样就使群众从具体的事实中体验到信用合作社的作用和好处，信用合作社便更加迅速地建立、扩大和健全起来。兴县白家庄等五个乡的信用合作社就是这样建立起来的。它们在吸收股金的同时，吸收了三百四十多万元存款，发放了二千七百多万元贷款，帮助农民解决了缺乏农具、种籽、口粮等的困难，得到农民热烈拥护，仅八月份，这五个社就扩大吸收了一千五百三十九名社员。
    八、九月间，山西省各县普遍召开了信用合作会议，拟定了今冬发展信用合作社的具体计划。现在，各地正积极进行冬季的建社工作。  （本报山西记者站）
