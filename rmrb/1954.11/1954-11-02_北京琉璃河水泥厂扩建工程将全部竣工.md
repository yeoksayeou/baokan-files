The expansion project of the Beijing Liulihe Cement Plant, which began in April this year, includes 23 construction items such as new cement mills, drying kilns, electric excavators, conveying equipment, and dust removal equipment. Sixteen projects have been completed and put into production; the remaining seven are currently installing machinery and are expected to be officially put into production in late November.

After this expansion, the plant will greatly change its original appearance. For example, after the newly built cement mill and drying kiln are put into production, the plant's annual cement production will increase by about 30%, creating conditions for the production of multi-grade cement next year. Secondly, this expansion has further mechanized some of the plant's production processes. For example, after the newly built electric excavator and conveying equipment are put into production, only two or three people per shift will be needed to operate the machines, replacing the heavy manual labor of one or twenty workers per shift in the past.

    北京琉璃河水泥厂扩建工程将全部竣工
    北京琉璃河水泥厂从今年四月开始扩建，工程项目共有新建水泥磨、烘干窑、电扒、输送设备以及吸尘设备等二十三个。目前已有十六项工程竣工并开始生产；其它七项正在安装机器，预计在十一月下旬即可正式投入生产。
    该厂在这次扩建后，将大大地改变原来的面貌。如新建的水泥磨和烘干窑投入生产后，将使全厂的水泥年产量提高百分之三十左右，并为明年生产多标号水泥创造了条件。其次，经过这次扩建，使该厂部分生产过程更进一步机械化。如新建的电扒和输送设备投入生产后，每班只用两三个人掌握机器，就代替了过去每班一、二十个工人的笨重体力劳动。  （李诚夫）
