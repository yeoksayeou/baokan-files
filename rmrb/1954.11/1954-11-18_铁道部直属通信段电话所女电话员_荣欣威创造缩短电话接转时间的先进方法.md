Rong Xinwei, a female telephone operator at the Telephone Section of the Directly Subordinate Communications Section of the Ministry of Railways, has created an advanced method for shortening railway telephone transfer times. The advanced method she created can shorten the telephone transfer time from an average of more than fifty seconds per call in January to an average of 10.5 seconds now, and as fast as 1.3 seconds. Taking her improved efficiency on October 18, an average day for her work on the Jinan long-distance switchboard, as an example, if the efficiency of the other three comrades working with her on the Jinan long-distance platform could be the same as hers, then 44,000 yuan could be saved in 24 hours; if everyone in the entire telephone section could emulate her working method, 9.94 million yuan could be saved.

Rong Xinwei is an 18-year-old member of the Communist Youth League. When she first started working at the long-distance switchboard of the Ministry of Railways telephone exchange in 1951, she was still a first-year junior high school student and thought that being a telephone operator was not promising. After much practical education in life and studying the general line, she realized the importance of the work of a railway telephone operator, began to love her work, and began to study how to shorten call transfer times in January of this year. First of all, she thought that to shorten the call transfer time, she must cooperate well with the other telephone exchange and the user. Therefore, she discussed it with the three comrades who worked with her, took the initiative to set up a guarantee plan with the Jinan Railway Telephone Exchange, and communicated with each other, exchanging opinions once every day after 5:30 pm. In order to cooperate well with users and reduce waste of transfer time, she tried to avoid notifying users of phone calls during work breaks. Secondly, in order to save transfer time, she rationally arranged the operation process, and when doing the previous work, she thought about preparing for the next step, so that each work could be connected to each other, trying to save even a second. She conducted many experiments based on the above two points. After solving many practical difficulties encountered, the transfer time was shortened from the original average of more than 50 seconds to 38 seconds, and the shortest to 4 seconds. Later, she further studied, and each transfer time was shortened to an average of 10.5 seconds, the shortest being 1.3 seconds, and without making mistakes.

Her method of shortening the transfer time is accurate, fast, and flexible, which effectively improves the utilization rate of return lines and greatly exerts the potential of existing communication equipment, providing a model for solving the current insufficient railway telephone communication capacity. Now, the Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Railways has technically appraised her working method, summarized it as the "Rong Xinwei Operation Method," and promoted it throughout the institute. As a result, the average transfer time per call in the institute has been shortened from the past 60 to 70 seconds to 48.3 seconds, and it is still continuing to shorten. (Xinhua News Agency)

    铁道部直属通信段电话所女电话员
    荣欣威创造缩短电话接转时间的先进方法
    一种缩短铁路电话接转时间的先进方法，已在铁道部直属通信段电话所女电话员荣欣威手中诞生。她创造的一套先进方法，可使电话接转时间从一月份每次平均五十多秒，缩短到现在平均十点五秒，最快到一点三秒。拿十月十八日全月最普通的一天她提高的效率来计算，如果在她通济南的长途台上工作的其他三人的效率能和她一样，那么一天二十四小时中就能节省四万四千元；如果全电话所所有的人都能仿效她的工作法，就能节省九百九十四万元。
    荣欣威是个十八岁的青年团员。在一九五一年刚到铁道部电话所长途台工作时，她还是初中一年级的学生，对当电话员认为没有出息。通过生活中许多实际教育和总路线的学习后，她才认识到铁路电话员工作的重要性，对工作开始热爱，并在今年一月开始钻研如何缩短通话接转时间。首先，她想到要缩短通话线路接转时间，必须和对方电话所及用户配合好才能做到。因此，她跟她一起工作的三个同志谈好，主动跟济南铁路电话所订出保证计划，并互相通信，每天十七点半以后和对方交换一次意见。为了和用户配合好，减少接转时间的浪费，她设法避免在工间操时间给用户预告电话。其次，为节省接转时间，她合理地安排操作过程，在做上一工作时，就想法为下一步工作做好各项准备，使每个工作都能互相衔接，哪怕一秒钟都设法节省。她根据以上两点进行了多次试验，在解决了遇到的许多实际困难后，接转时间就由原来平均一次五十多秒缩短到三十八秒，最短到四秒。后来她又进一步钻研，每次接转时间，又缩短到平均十点五秒，最短为一点三秒，而且不出错。
    她的缩短接转时间的操作方法准确、迅速、灵活，有效地提高了回线运用率，大大发挥了现有通讯设备的潜力，在解决目前铁路电话通话能力不足上提供了范例。现在铁道部电务局已给她的工作方法作了技术鉴定，总结成“荣欣威操作方法”，并在全所推广。因而使全所平均一次接转时间已由过去六、七十秒缩短到四十八点三秒，而且还在继续缩短中。（新华社）
