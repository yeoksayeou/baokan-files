Dalian Port Station Completes October Transportation Tasks Ahead of Schedule

On the evening of October 22nd, Dalian Port Station completed its entire month's transportation tasks ahead of schedule. In order to complete the busy monthly transportation tasks ahead of schedule, the station's employees devised many methods. The business station master and the cashier took the initiative to contact cargo owners to study how to compile the six five-day plans for the whole month into four five-day plans, striving to ship the goods in advance, so as to guarantee the timely loading and transportation of materials arriving at the port outside the plan. For example, in October, a large amount of tea, pig bristles, and other export goods transported by combined transport arrived at Dalian Port, which had to be transshipped abroad by the station. The loading time was urgent, but with the active efforts of the station's employees, carefully selecting vehicle types, and cooperating with relevant parties, the tasks were completed on time. In their work, the employees demonstrated initiative. For example, when loading apples on the night of October 5th, there were insufficient cold-proof straw curtains, so the weighers braved the light rain to help the cargo owner pull a small cart of straw curtains, and the apples were transported out on time. They said: "Shipping these special products out sooner will allow us to exchange them for machines sooner, making our industrial production stronger and supporting the People's Liberation Army to liberate Taiwan sooner!" Thanks to the efforts of all the station's employees, by 18:00 on the 22nd, the port station had already overshipped 460 more tons of goods.

    大连港站提前完成十月份运输任务
    十月二十二日傍晚，大连港站即提前完成了十月份全月运输任务。为了提前完成全月繁忙的运输任务，该站员工曾想了很多办法，商务站长和出纳员曾主动地联系货主，研究把全月六个五日计划编成四个五日计划，争取提前把货运出，这样就对计划外抵港的物资也有力量保证按时装运。如十月中有大量的茶叶、猪鬃等运抵大连港的联运出口货物，要由该站转运国外，装车时间急迫，但是在该站员工们的积极努力下，认真挑选车型，并和有关方面配合，因此都按时完成了任务。在工作中，员工们发挥了积极性，如在十月五日夜间装苹果时，防寒草帘子不足，司磅员们就冒着小雨帮助货主拉了一小车草帘子，按时把苹果运了出去。他们说：“把这些特产早些运出去，就能早些换回机器，使我们工业生产力量更壮大，支援解放军早日解放台湾！”由于全站员工们的努力，到二十二日十八点止，港站就已超额运出了四百六十多吨货物。
