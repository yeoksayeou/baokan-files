    1954 was the most intensive year for our company in undertaking the construction tasks of the First Automobile Works, and it was also a crucial year in the construction of the plant. The main tasks of civil construction were concentrated in this year's construction. Thanks to the enthusiastic guidance and help of Soviet experts, we overcame various difficulties in the heavy construction and improved work efficiency. Since the large-scale commencement of work in May, we have overfulfilled the state plan every month except for August.
    In early May, various factory buildings started construction one after another. Due to insufficient preparation before the commencement of work, the allocation of manpower and materials could not keep up, so the site was chaotic and the construction plan could not be completed. At this time, Soviet experts suggested strengthening planned construction, adjusting the concrete supply, and advised the leadership to check daily, thus reversing the chaotic situation on the site and ensuring that the monthly construction plan was completed with an overfulfillment of 7%. Soviet expert Mirzak proposed the slogan "Walking Ahead of Time" in the 104 construction area and advocated starting projects that could be started outside the plan in advance. As a result, the construction of the sulfite warehouse and the basement of the coke pit were started ahead of schedule, resulting in an overfulfillment of the monthly plan by 9.35%. In June, Soviet experts proposed the slogan "Strive to Complete Projects Under Construction Ahead of Schedule" and suggested increasing machinery, improving operations, implementing assembly line operations, and launching labor competitions. As a result, the construction area overfulfilled the construction plan by 67.5% in June. Therefore, the workers often said: "Wherever the experts go, the enthusiasm to complete the task increases there."
    Soviet experts pay great attention to thrift. They propose that every suggestion must be carefully calculated on the project cost. For example, more than 6 billion yuan was needed for the felt gaskets used for the skylights of the factory building. Soviet expert Basterlokov believed it was too wasteful and regrettable. He suggested not using felt gaskets, but simply increasing the specifications of the large windows to meet the construction requirements. We implemented this suggestion and saved all the gasket felt. The metal component factory implemented the expert's suggestion of using a Danish mixture for painting steel, which can reduce the cost of paint by 40%. Statistics for July, August, and September alone saved 300 million yuan. In August, the first and third construction areas implemented the expert's five suggestions such as using square floor tiles instead of hexagonal floor tiles, which can reduce costs by 950 million yuan, completing 50% of the construction area's cost reduction plan for the second half of the year. When the 106 construction area carried out the foundation anti-corrosion work, it implemented the expert's suggestion of applying asphalt to one meter above the groundwater level. Preliminary calculations show that the three sections can save 14 tons of asphalt in three months. The 101 construction area implemented the expert's two suggestions that the waterproof layer of the roof does not need to be made of benzene (a mixture of asphalt and oil) and the moisture-proof layer on the basement cushion of the living room does not need to be coated with asphalt, which can save more than 360 million yuan. In addition, after the implementation of many suggestions of Soviet experts on steel structure, steel component welding, and moisture-proof layers, we have saved countless funds.
    At the beginning of each project, Soviet experts reminded us to pay attention to the quality of the project in advance. Projects that do not meet quality standards are insisted on being reworked; in the event of a quality accident, we are advised to carry out proper remedial work. During the rainy season construction, we were carrying out foundation engineering, and experts often went to the construction site twice a day. The experts believed that the more it rained, the more they should go to the construction site to check. The foundation drainage problem was solved with the specific help of the experts, so that the most important part of the factory building - the foundation - was guaranteed in quality. For example, the basement of the living room of the wood factory in the 102 construction area and the basement of the sulfite warehouse in the 104 construction area leaked water after being built, and remedial work was carried out with the help of experts.
    In terms of safe construction, Soviet experts paid meticulous attention. Every time the experts went to the site, they had to check the safety of the scaffolding and suggested widening and securing the scaffolding boards, and binding railings on both sides of the scaffolding. Especially when carrying out high-altitude operations, the experts constantly used Stalin's famous saying - people are the most valuable asset - to educate everyone.
    Soviet experts also helped us carry out major reforms in production operations and production technology. Based on the Soviet construction acceptance specifications and combined with our construction experience, they helped us formulate construction operation procedures and determined the operation standards for project construction. Soviet experts also helped us promote the construction method of prefabricating and installing large blocks in the living room of the 104 construction area and the pipeline project of the 110 construction area. This is a major innovation in construction engineering. This method of building walls is not restricted by climate and seasons, and it can greatly reduce costs and improve work efficiency. Another example is the "inner scaffolding wall building method" suggested by experts, which replaces the outer scaffolding with prefabricated inner scaffolding. This not only saves a lot of wood, but also saves binding time, which can reduce processes and improve project efficiency.
    In terms of construction management, experts helped us carry out assembly line operation construction, which greatly improved the level of construction management. In the 104 construction area, there is a three-story reinforced concrete structure, in which four processes are operated simultaneously at the same time. Inside the basement project of the sand mixing department, it is successively divided into six sections, ninety types of work and processes, and different operations are carried out in the same time and the same part of the project. According to the old construction method, it takes about a month. This shortens the construction period, accelerates the progress, reduces the phenomenon of idle work, and basically achieves balanced construction.
    The serious and responsible work style, internationalist spirit, and socialist moral qualities of Soviet experts are also models for us to learn from. Many experts check the project on site every day in the wind and rain without stopping.
  Qu Qingxiang, a technical inspector in the 102 construction area, said: "Experts care about our projects as if they were their own." When installing steel columns in the forging workshop, in order to check whether each foundation and elevation were correct, expert Basterlokov ran to the construction site early in the morning and checked all 293 column bases from beginning to end before returning to the office. Experts also care about the interests of the people everywhere. For example, in the dormitory area, a large amount of sewage will be discharged this year, which will have a great impact on the health of the nearby rural areas. Expert Lieshanlov suggested setting up an epidemic prevention station in the nearby rural areas, testing the water in wells near the river at any time, and suggesting accelerating the design to strive for the construction of a sewage treatment station in the first quarter of next year.
    Now we are preparing for winter construction with the help of experts. Winter construction measures will make our construction industry no longer restricted by seasons in the future, and the plant construction tasks can also be completed earlier. In addition, thanks to the help of Soviet experts, we have also learned to manufacture many new products.
    Soviet experts are helping us build the First Automobile Works so kindly. Under the guidance of Soviet experts, we are determined to further learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and strive to complete the construction task of the First Automobile Works as soon as possible!

    苏联专家在第一汽车制造厂
    建筑工程部直属工程公司专家工作室
    一九五四年是我们公司承建第一汽车制造厂工程任务最紧张的一年，也是建厂中带有关键性的一年。土木建筑的主要任务都集中在今年施工，由于苏联专家的热情指导和帮助，我们在繁重的施工中克服了各种困难，提高了工作效率，自从五月份大量开工以来，除了八月份以外，月月超额完成了国家计划。
    五月初各个厂房先后施工，因开工前准备不足，人力配备和料具调拨配合不上，所以现场紊乱，完不成施工计划。这时苏联专家提出加强计划施工，调整混凝土供应，建议领导方面日日检查，因而扭转了现场的紊乱现象，保证月施工计划以超额百分之七完成了。苏联专家米尔扎克，在一○四工区又提出“走在时间前头”的口号，并主张计划外能开工的项目提前开工，因而亚硫酸仓库和焦碳坑地下室工程都提前开工，结果超额完成月计划百分之九点三五。六月份苏联专家又提出“把开工的工程争取提前竣工”的口号，并建议增加机械，改进操作，实行流水作业，开展劳动竞赛，因而六月份该工区又超额完成施工计划百分之六十七点五。所以工人们常说：“专家走到那里，那里就增加了完成任务的劲头。”
    苏联专家是非常注意节约的。他们提出每项建议都要在工程成本上仔细盘算。如厂房天窗用的呢料垫片需六十多亿元，苏联专家巴斯特洛库夫认为太浪费、太可惜。他建议不用呢料垫片，只要把大窗规格提高，就可以满足建筑要求。我们执行了这个建议，节约了全部垫片呢料。金属构件工厂执行了专家的油漆钢材用丹掺合料的建议，可降低油漆成本百分之四十，仅七、八、九三个月统计就节约三亿元。一、三工区八月份执行了专家的方块地板代替六角地板等五项建议，可降低成本九亿五千万元，完成了该工区下半年降低成本计划的百分之五十。一○六工区进行基础防腐工作时执行了专家提出柏油涂至地下水位以上一公尺的建议，三个工段在三个月内初步计算可节约柏油十四吨。一○一工区贯彻专家关于屋面防水层不做苯（沥清与油的掺合料）和生活间地下室垫层上防潮层不涂柏油的两项建议，即可节约三亿六千多万元。此外，苏联专家关于钢材结构、钢构件焊接和防潮层方面的许多建议实现后，给我们节约下来了难以数计的资金。
    苏联专家在每一项工程开始时，就预先提醒我们注意工程质量。不合质量标准的工程都坚持进行返工；发生了质量事故，就建议我们进行妥善补救的工作。雨季施工的时候，我们正在进行基础工程，专家经常每日两次去工地，专家认为愈是落雨，愈要去工地检查。基础排水问题就在专家具体帮助下得到解决，使厂房工程最主要的部分——基础得以保证了质量。再如一○二工区木工厂生活间地下室和一○四工区亚硫酸仓库地下室工程，做好后室内漏水，也都在专家帮助下进行了补救工作。
    在安全施工方面，苏联专家更是无微不至地给予注意。专家每次到现场都要检查脚手架保险程度，并建议把架手板加宽放牢，脚手架的两边要绑栏杆，特别在进行高空作业时，专家还不断用斯大林的名言——人是最宝贵的财产，来教育大家。
    苏联专家还帮助我们进行了生产操作、生产技术上的重大改革。他们依据苏联的施工验收规范结合了我们的施工经验，帮助我们制定了施工操作规程，确定了工程施工上的操作标准。苏联专家还帮助我们在一○四工区生活间和一一○工区管道工程中推行了大型砌块预制安装的施工方法。这是建筑工程上的重大革新。这样砌墙既不受气候季节的限制，而且可大大降低成本，提高工作效率。再如专家建议的“里脚手砌墙法”，以预制的里脚手架代替外脚手架。这不仅在木料上大大节约，而且还省去了绑扎时间，可以减少工序，提高工程效率。
    在施工管理方面，专家帮助我们进行流水作业法施工，大大提高了施工管理水平。一○四工区有一个三层的钢筋混凝土结构，在同一时间四个工序同时操作。合砂部地下室工程里面，先后分成六个段、九十个工种和工序，在同一时间和同一部分工程中进行不同操作。按旧的施工方法，需要相距一月左右的时间。这就缩短了工期，加速了进度，减少了窝工现象，并在基本上做到均衡施工。
    苏联专家严肃负责的作风、国际主义精神和社会主义的道德品质，同样也是我们学习的榜样。许多专家每天风里雨里从不停息地在现场检查工程。
  一○二工区技术检查员渠清香说：“专家对我们的工程，就像对自己事一样关心。”锻工场安装钢柱时，为了检查每个基础、标高是否正确，专家巴斯特洛库夫一清早就跑到工地，把二百九十三个柱基从头至尾地校对过了，才回到办公室里去。专家还处处关怀着人民的利益。如在宿舍区，今年要将大量污水排出去，对附近农村卫生很有影响。专家烈山洛夫就建议，在附近农村设立防疫站，靠河饮水井要随时化验，并建议加速设计争取明年第一季度修建污水处理站。
    现在我们正在专家帮助下准备冬季施工。冬季施工的措施，将使我们建筑业今后不再受到季节的限制，建厂任务也能够提早完成。另外由于苏联专家的帮助，我们也学会了制造许多新产品。
    苏联专家就是这样亲切地帮助我们建设第一汽车制造厂的。我们在苏联专家的指导下，决心进一步学习苏联先进经验，争取第一汽车制造厂建厂任务早日完成！
