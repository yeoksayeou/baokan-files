Responses to Criticism and Suggestions

    The Ministry of Heavy Industry's Chemical Industry Administration is Finalizing the Closure of Linglong Mine
    Letter from the Ministry of Heavy Industry: The People's Daily published Comrade Chen Lijun's letter on August 9th, reflecting a serious lack of responsibility within our Ministry's Chemical Industry Administration during the takeover of the former Shandong Province Local State-Owned Linglong Mining Company. This situation is indeed accurate. The Chemical Industry Administration has organized a team to handle the closure of Linglong Mine. Currently, the Chemical Industry Administration, with the consent of relevant units, has decided on the principles for handling the assets of Linglong Mine awaiting disposal. For fixed assets: land, buildings, etc., which cannot be moved and used, will be transferred to the local administrative authorities; machinery, power, transmission, and transportation equipment will be retained and sold at a negotiated price. For current assets: cash in bank deposits will be remitted; the difference between accounts receivable and payable will be cleared and remitted within a specified time limit; slow-moving materials will be transferred to Qingdao Hardware and Materials Company. As for surplus personnel, they will be transferred gradually. All the above work will be completed within this year.
    Review by the Chemical Industry Administration: The lack of responsibility during our administration's takeover of Shandong Linglong Mine was a serious situation. Why did this happen? No objective reason can alleviate our responsibility in the slightest; the main reason for this incident is the serious bureaucracy within our administration's leadership. When deciding to take over the mine, we lacked thorough consideration of the mine's then arrangements and long-term plans and hastily formed a team to carry out the work. The leadership lacked specific and clear instructions on takeover principles and methods, especially adopting an unserious attitude towards financial handover procedures, mistakenly believing that "both parties to the handover are state organs, and the handover is only a change in affiliation, so there is no need to quibble over some procedures." Therefore, for issues such as deferred expenses and material price differences in financial matters, and for the disposal of mine equipment after the dissolution of the Exploration Brigade, we did not adopt an active and consultative approach but instead adopted a procrastinating and passive attitude. Under the criticism and urging of comrades, our administration decided to form a team to handle the handover procedures and designated the Geological Division to manage it specifically; the head of the Geological Division insisted on not taking charge, and our administration's leaders did not seriously and resolutely reverse this situation but instead did not check or inquire, allowing the decision to go unexecuted. In short, this problem could not be resolved for a long time due to being pushed upwards, approved downwards, discussed but not decided, and decided but not implemented. This shows our erroneous attitude of indifference to state property. In addition to taking effective measures to actively carry out the closure of Linglong Mine, we are determined to strengthen inspection work, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and accept the serious lessons of this incident to earnestly improve our future work.
　　Tianjin Chemical Plant Review
  　Erroneous Attitude Towards Brotherly Enterprises
    Letter from Tianjin Chemical Plant: The reader's letter published in the People's Daily on October 25th criticized our factory's erroneous attitude towards brotherly enterprises. This criticism is correct. Some cadres in our factory adopted an insincere and irresponsible attitude in signing an agreement with Tianjin Paper Mill on the transfer of liquid chlorine, which caused difficulties for Tianjin Paper Mill and caused undue losses. The main reason is that our factory's political and ideological leadership is weak, and the ideological education of cadres is poorly done. Therefore, some cadres have fostered complacency, and their work is not thorough, and they make decisions arbitrarily. The error of Du Jinzhang, the head of the Technology Supply Section who was directly responsible for the liquid chlorine issue, occurred in this way. After discovering that the factory did not lack liquid chlorine and that the transfer price was higher than the allocation price, our factory's leaders firmly demanded a refund. This attitude of only considering one's own convenience and disregarding the difficulties of others is obviously wrong. We are determined to learn from this incident, improve our future work, and correct our attitude towards brotherly enterprises.

    批评建议的反应
　　重工业部化学工业管理局正在进行玲珑矿的结束工作
    重工业部来信：八月九日人民日报登载了陈力军同志的来信，反映我部化学工业管理局在接收原山东省地方国营玲珑矿业公司的工作中发生了严重的无人负责现象，这个情况是确实的。玲珑矿的结束工作，已由化工局组织小组前去办理。目前，化工局征得有关单位的同意，决定了对玲珑矿待处理资财的处理原则。固定资产部分：土地、房屋等因无法移动使用，移交当地行政机关；机械、动力、传动及运输设备分别保留，变价处理。流动资产部分：银行库存现金即上缴；债权债务差额限期清理上缴；呆滞材料转帐拨给青岛市五金器材公司。至于多余人员，则陆续抽调。以上工作，都限于本年度内全部办理结束。
    化学工业管理局的检讨：我局接管山东玲珑矿时发生了无人负责现象，情况是严重的。为什么会造成这种现象呢？任何客观原因也丝毫不能减轻我们应负的责任；造成这次事件的主要原因是我局领导方面存在着严重的官僚主义。在决定接收该矿时，我们对该矿当时的安排和长远的计划缺乏周密考虑，就匆促地组成小组进行工作。领导方面对接收原则和接收方法缺乏具体的、明确的交代，尤其对财务接交手续采取了不严肃的态度，错误地认为“接交双方都是国家机关，接交问题只不过是隶属关系的改变，用不着在一些手续上纠缠”。因此，对于财务问题上的待摊费用和材料差价问题，对于勘采大队撤销后矿山设备处理问题，都不是采取积极协商解决的态度，而采取了拖拉的消极态度。在同志们的批评督促下，我局曾决定成立小组去办理接交手续，并指定地质处专门管理；地质处负责人坚持不管，我局领导同志不是严肃而坚决地扭转这种情况，而却不检查、不过问，任凭决定不执行。总之，这个问题在推上来、批下去、议而不决、决而不行的情况下长期不能解决。这表现了我们对国家财产漠不关心的错误态度。我们除采取有效措施积极进行玲珑矿的结束工作外，并决心加强检查工作，开展批评和自我批评，以接爱这个事件的严重教训，认真改进今后的工作。
　　天津化工厂检讨
  　对待兄弟企业的错误态度
    天津化工厂来信：十月二十五日人民日报发表的读者来信，批评我厂对待兄弟企业的错误态度。这个批评是正确的。我厂某些干部在同天津造纸总厂签订关于转让液氯协议的问题上，采取了不诚恳、不负责任的态度，以致使天津造纸总厂工作发生困难，受到不应有的损失。主要原因是我厂政治思想领导薄弱，对干部的思想教育工作做得很差，因此在一部分干部中，滋长着骄傲自满情绪，工作不深入，决定问题时自做主张。液氯问题的直接责任者技术供应科长杜锦章的错误就是这样发生的。我厂领导干部发现厂内液氯并不缺少以及转让价格又比调拨价格高的情况以后，又坚决要求退货。这种只顾自己方便、不管别人困难的态度，显然是错误的。我们决心从这个事件中接受教训，改进今后的工作，并端正对兄弟企业的态度。
