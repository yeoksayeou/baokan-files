Xinhua News Agency, London, 10th—The British House of Commons held a debate on the Southeast Asia Treaty on the 8th.

In the proposal submitted to Parliament, the Churchill government deliberately linked the Geneva Conference's agreement on the peaceful resolution of the Indochina issue with the Manila Treaty, which stipulates the establishment of a Southeast Asian military bloc, and asked Parliament to approve the government's policy "as demonstrated in the agreements reached in Geneva and the treaty signed in Manila."

British Foreign Secretary Eden spoke at the beginning of the debate. He tried his best to defend the Southeast Asia Treaty, insisting that this aggressive military treaty was "purely defensive in nature" and "fully in line with the United Nations Charter and the Geneva Accords." He also insisted that the Manila Treaty made Southeast Asian countries "feel safe and aware that someone is defending them." He asked some Asian countries that were unwilling to join the bloc to "change their minds."

The main speaker for the Labor Party, former Deputy Foreign Secretary Younger, stated in his speech that the Labor Party "expressed doubts about this hastily concluded treaty." He said that American commentators like Lippmann believed that the purpose of the Southeast Asia Treaty was to permit international interference in the domestic affairs of other countries. If this were the case, it would be a "very dangerous proposition." He expressed concern that countries like India had not joined the bloc, while Britain had "joined so quickly." He believed that such a bloc "cannot be regarded as a perfect form of Southeast Asian defense," and advocated for the signing of a joint security treaty with China's participation.

However, Younger also said that the Labor Party did not intend to vote against it and did not want to be seen as Britain failing to fulfill the "obligations" stipulated by the Southeast Asia Treaty.

Labor MP Harold Davies said: The treaty signed in Manila is dangerous; it does not defend Southeast Asia but insults it. "It undermines the United Nations Charter...It wastes the good work done in Geneva and makes India's good work to achieve consensus futile." He believed that only by holding a conference with the participation of China, the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain to discuss the entire issue of Southeast Asian security can a Far East security system be established.

Labor MPs Gordon Walker and Warbey also criticized the British government's policy in Southeast Asia.

British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Robert Turton, stated in his reply that Britain's policy was to create a situation in Southeast Asia similar to the situation in Europe after the establishment of the North Atlantic military aggression bloc.

At the end of the debate, no one proposed a motion against the government's proposal. The government's proposal was passed without a vote.

### 英议会下院通过马尼拉条约  工党议员抨击英政府东南亚政策

    英议会下院通过马尼拉条约
    工党议员抨击英政府东南亚政策
    【新华社十日讯】伦敦消息：英国议会下院在八日就东南亚条约问题举行辩论。
    邱吉尔政府在提交议会的提案里，故意把日内瓦会议关于和平解决印度支那问题的协议同那个规定要建立东南亚军事集团的马尼拉条约硬拉在一起，而要求议会批准政府“在日内瓦达成的协议和在马尼拉签订的条约中所表明的”政策。
    英国外交大臣艾登在辩论开始时发言。他竭力为东南亚条约辩护，硬说这个侵略性的军事条约是
  “纯粹防御性质的”，是“完全符合联合国宪章和日内瓦协定的”。他还硬说马尼拉条约使东南亚国家“感到安全并且意识到有人在保卫它们”。他要求某些不愿参加这个集团的亚洲国家“改变主意”。
    工党的主要发言人、前外交副大臣杨格在发言中表示，工党“对这个匆匆缔结的条约表示怀疑”。他说，像李普曼这样的美国评论家都认为东南亚条约的目的在于准许对别国的国内事务进行国际干涉。如果真是这样，那就是一种“非常危险的主张”。他对印度等国没有参加这个集团而英国却“这样迅速地参加”表示不安。他认为这样的集团“谈不上是东南亚防务的一种完善形式”，而主张签订一个有中国参加的共同安全条约。
    但是杨格又说，工党并不打算投反对票，而且不希望被人认为英国会不履行东南亚条约所规定的“义务”。
    工党议员哈·戴维斯说：在马尼拉签订的条约是危险的，它不是保卫东南亚，而是侮辱东南亚。
  “它破坏了联合国宪章……它使日内瓦进行的良好工作成为白费气力，它使印度为了取得一致而进行的良好工作徒劳无功。”他认为，只有举行有中国、苏联、美国和英国参加的会议来讨论关于东南亚安全的整个问题，远东安全体系才能够建立起来。
    工党议员戈登—华尔克和华贝也抨击了英国政府在东南亚的政策。
    英国外交次官罗伯特·脱顿在答辩中表示，英国的政策就是要在东南亚制造这样一个局面，这个局面和北大西洋军事侵略集团建立后的欧洲局面一样。
    辩论结束时，没有人提出反对政府提案的动议。政府的提案没有经过表决，就算通过。
