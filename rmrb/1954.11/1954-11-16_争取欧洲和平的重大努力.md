　　The Soviet government, on November 13th, sent notes to European countries that have diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and to the United States, proposing that a conference including all European countries and the United States willing to participate be held in Moscow or Paris on November 29th to discuss the establishment of a European collective security system. This note was also sent to our government; our country has been invited to send representatives to participate in the above-mentioned meeting as observers. This proposal by the Soviet government is a major effort to strive for European peace and safeguard world peace. All European countries and all peace-loving people around the world warmly welcome this constructive effort by the Soviet government.

　　The current situation in Europe is that the demand for establishing a European collective security system through the joint efforts of all European countries is becoming increasingly urgent. The Western countries, headed by the American aggressive forces, disregard the trend of relaxation in the international situation since the Berlin Conference and the Geneva Conference, and disregard the strong desire of the European people to oppose the revival of German militarism and the establishment of exclusive aggressive military blocs in Europe. They are openly embarking on rearming West Germany and establishing a Western European military alliance including Britain to replace the already collapsed "European Defense Community". The agreement on West Germany signed by the United States and relevant Western European countries in Paris on October 23rd is an agreement to realize the above-mentioned sinister goals. According to the so-called Paris Accords, West Germany's revanchist forces will rebuild an army of 500,000 to 520,000 men, which will be able to possess atomic weapons; at the same time, West Germany's heavy industry will carry out arms production without restriction. A rearmed West Germany will also join the Western European military alliance and the North Atlantic aggressive group, which are being cobbled together. And the establishment of such a military group is aimed at opposing other European countries.

　　Therefore, it is very clear: if the intentions of the creators of the Paris Accords are realized, the tense situation in Europe will be greatly increased, and the danger that West German militarist forces may provoke a devastating atomic war in Europe will be possible. Now, Western countries are trying to speed up the approval of the Paris Accords by the parliaments of the countries concerned. U.S. President Eisenhower submitted the Paris Accords to the U.S. Senate for approval on the 15th; the parliaments of other relevant Western European countries will also begin to consider the Paris Accords in December under pressure from the United States. All peace-loving forces cannot but express serious concern and great indignation about this.

　　In order to avoid Europe being ravaged again by the flames of war ignited by the German "Wehrmacht", the Soviet Union has consistently been committed to unifying Germany into a peace-loving and democratic country, and has actively striven to establish a European collective security system. Especially after the Geneva Conference, the Soviet government repeatedly sent notes to the governments of France, Britain, and the United States on July 24th, August 4th, and October 23rd, suggesting that a pan-European conference be held to study the establishment of a European collective security system, and suggested that a meeting of the foreign ministers of the four countries of France, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union be held to discuss the restoration of Germany's unity on a peaceful and democratic basis, the holding of free all-German elections, the withdrawal of the four-country occupying forces from the territories of East and West Germany, and issues related to the convening of a pan-European conference and the preparation for a European collective security system. The Soviet Union's persistent efforts to seek a peaceful solution to the German question and the establishment of a European collective security system have been widely welcomed and supported by the public in European countries. Broad sections of people in Western European countries, including French Gaullists, British Labour Party members, and West German Social Democratic leaders, advocate holding negotiations with the Soviet Union to seek European collective security.

　　However, the American aggressive forces and their partners, who are bent on turning West Germany into a breeding ground for war in Europe, are so afraid of the universal desire of the European people for collective security that they do not hesitate to use various excuses to delay responding to the Soviet proposals. While they are eagerly trying to implement the agreement to rearm West Germany, they are spreading various lies, insisting that the Western countries can only hold negotiations with the Soviet Union on the German issue and European security after the relevant countries participating in the Paris Accords approve the Paris Accords. They want to use this false promise of reaching an agreement with the Soviet Union in the "future" to paralyze the vigilance of the public and public opinion in various countries against the sinister plan to revive German militarism, and to curb the growing call for negotiations with the Soviet Union in European countries. But this deceptive trick cannot confuse clear-headed people.

　　Because, people will see that if the Paris Accords are implemented, the revival of German militarism will become inevitable; this means that the cause of restoring Germany's unity through holding free all-German elections will therefore be ruined.

　　It is equally clear that after the Paris Accords are approved, not only will the "Western European Union," including West German revanchism, become a military group against other European countries, but the aggressive nature of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization will also be strengthened due to the accession of a remilitarized West Germany. Historical experience has long shown that the formation of military groups of certain European countries hostile to other European countries will inevitably lead to war in the end.

　　What cannot be ignored is that since West German militarist forces are allowed to rearm and can act freely, West Germany is transformed into a hotbed of new wars, and things will inevitably develop to the point where European countries, especially those neighboring Germany, once again face the threat of German militarist aggression. In this case, there is no guarantee of the security of European countries.

　　Therefore, all European countries cannot turn a blind eye to the serious consequences inevitably caused by the arbitrary policies of the American aggressive bloc and its followers. The interests of European countries require that the development of Europe should not follow the dead end of reviving German militarism and establishing opposing military blocs in Europe, but should follow the path of establishing a pan-European security system based on taking into account the legitimate interests of all European countries, large and small. The Soviet government's proposal to convene a pan-European conference on November 29th to discuss the establishment of a European collective security system is very timely. The Soviet Union's long-standing proposal for a pan-European treaty on the establishment of a European collective security system is based on the principle of member states taking collective action against threats and armed attacks against any signatory to the treaty, as well as the principle of economic cooperation. Therefore, the Soviet proposal contains a genuine guarantee of the security of all European countries, large and small. At the same time, it creates the most favorable conditions for re-establishing Germany's national unity and for Germany's free and peaceful development. Obviously, this proposal is in the common interest of all European countries.

　　It is urgent for all European countries to make joint efforts to establish collective guarantees for European security. Only in this way can Europe be prevented from being dragged into a new war by German militarist forces once again. European countries and peace-loving forces around the world should strive to actively realize the Soviet proposal to convene a pan-European conference.

　　The Chinese people are not only concerned about peace in Asia, but also about peace in Europe. Our Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai pointed out in his foreign policy report on August 11th: "We hope that the people of European countries, after suffering the disasters of two world wars, can enjoy peaceful life. If a European collective security system can be established, it will not only be conducive to ensuring peace in Europe, but also conducive to ensuring peace in Asia and the world." Therefore, our people warmly support the Soviet proposal to hold a pan-European conference and are willing to have our own observers present.

### 争取欧洲和平的重大努力

    争取欧洲和平的重大努力
  　苏联政府于十一月十三日向已同苏联有外交关系的欧洲国家及美国提出照会，建议于十一月二十九日在莫斯科或者巴黎召开一个包括所有愿意参加的欧洲国家及美国的会议，来讨论建立欧洲集体安全体系的问题。这个照会同时也送交给我国政府；我国已被邀请派遣代表作为观察员参加上述会议。苏联政府这个建议是争取欧洲和平并维护世界和平的一个重大努力。所有的欧洲国家和一切爱好和平的各国人民都热烈欢迎苏联政府这个建设性的努力。
    目前的欧洲局势是：通过所有欧洲国家的共同努力，以谋求建立欧洲集体安全体系的要求是越来越迫切了。以美国侵略势力为首的西方国家，不顾柏林会议和日内瓦会议以来国际局势趋向和缓的形势，不顾欧洲各国人民反对复活德国军国主义、反对在欧洲建立排他性的侵略军事集团的强烈愿望，正公然着手要重新武装西德，并建立一个包括英国在内的西欧军事联盟，来代替已经垮台的“欧洲防务集团”。美国和西欧有关国家于十月二十三日在巴黎签订的有关西德的协定，就是要实现上述罪恶目标的协议。按照所谓巴黎协定，西德的复仇主义势力将重建一支五十万到五十二万人的军队，这支军队将能够拥有原子武器；同时西德的重工业将不受限制地进行军备生产。重新武装起来的西德并将加入正在拼凑起来的西欧军事联盟和北大西洋侵略集团。而这种军事集团的建立是以反对其他的欧洲国家为目的的。
    因此，事情很明显：巴黎协定的制造者的企图如果实现，将大大增加欧洲的紧张局势，并使西德军国主义势力有可能在欧洲挑起一场毁灭性的原子战争的危险。现在，西方国家正在设法加速使巴黎协定得到有关国家议会的批准。美国总统艾森豪威尔已于十五日把巴黎协定提交美国参议院批准；其他有关的西欧国家的议会在美国的压力下也将在十二月开始考虑巴黎协定的问题了。一切爱好和平的力量对此不能不表示严重的关怀和极大的愤慨。
    为了避免使欧洲重新遭受德国“国防军”所点起的战火的蹂躏，苏联一贯地致力于使德国统一成为一个爱好和平的民主的国家，并积极为建立欧洲的集体安全体系而努力。特别是在日内瓦会议以后，苏联政府更连续于七月二十四日、八月四日以及十月二十三日一再照会法、英、美三国政府，建议召开全欧会议以研究建立欧洲集体安全体系的问题，并建议召开法、英、美、苏四国外长会议来讨论在和平民主的基础上恢复德国的统一、举行全德自由选举、四国占领军撤出东西德的领土以及有关召开全欧会议、筹建欧洲集体安全体系的问题。苏联坚持不懈地谋求和平解决德国问题和建立欧洲集体安全体系的努力，得到了欧洲国家公众的广泛欢迎和支持。西欧国家的广泛阶层人士，包括法国戴高乐派、英国工党人士以及西德的社会民主党领袖都主张和苏联举行谈判，以谋求欧洲的集体安全。
    但是，一心要把西德变成欧洲的战争温床的美国侵略势力及其伙伴们，却十分害怕欧洲各国人民要求集体安全的普遍愿望，竟至不惜用各种借口拖延对苏联建议的答复。他们一面迫不及待地要实现重新武装西德的协议，一面又散布各种谎言，硬说要等参加巴黎协定的有关国家批准巴黎协定之后，西方国家才可以和苏联就德国问题和欧洲安全问题举行谈判。他们想用这种在“将来”和苏联取得协议的虚伪诺言，来麻痹各国公众和舆论对重新复活德国军国主义的罪恶计划的警惕，并阻遏在欧洲国家中日益增长的要求和苏联举行谈判的呼声。但是这种欺骗伎俩是迷惑不了头脑清醒的人们的。
    因为，人们都会看得出，如果巴黎协定一旦付之实施，德国军国主义的复活就将成为不可避免；这就意味着通过举行全德自由选举来恢复德国统一的事业将因此而断送。
    同样清楚的是，巴黎协定批准之后，不但包括西德复仇主义在内的“西欧联盟”将成为一个反对欧洲其他国家的军事集团，并且由于重新军国主义化的西德的加入，也将加强北大西洋公约集团的侵略性质。历史的经验早已表明：某些欧洲国家同其他欧洲国家为敌的军事集团的组成，最后将不可避免地要导向战争。
    更不容忽视的是，西德军国主义势力既然被容许重新武装起来并且可以自由行动，西德被变成为一个新战争的温床，事情就必然要发展到欧洲国家、特别是和德国邻近的国家重新面临德国军国主义的侵略威胁的地步。在这种情况下，欧洲国家的安全是没有任何保障的。
    因此，一切欧洲国家都不能对美国侵略集团及其追随者的武断政策所必然造成的严重后果熟视无睹。欧洲国家的利益要求欧洲的发展，不是沿着复活德国军国主义和在欧洲成立彼此对立的军事集团的死路，而是沿着在考虑到欧洲所有大大小小国家的合法利益的基础上建立一个全欧安全体系的道路进行。苏联政府提出的在十一月二十九日召开一个全欧会议，以讨论建立欧洲集体安全体系的建议，是十分适时的。苏联早已提出的关于建立欧洲集体安全体系的全欧条约的主张，是以各个成员国采取集体行动反对对任何这个条约的签字国的威胁和武装攻击的原则以及在经济方面合作的原则为基础的。因此，苏联的主张包含着对欧洲一切大小国家的安全的真正保证。同时它为重新建立德国的国家统一，为德国的自由及和平发展创造了最有利的条件。显然，这个主张是符合于一切欧洲国家的共同利益的。
    所有欧洲国家进行共同的努力，以建立对欧洲安全的集体保障是刻不容缓的。只有这样才能避免欧洲再一次被德国军国主义势力拖入新战争的危险。欧洲各国以及全世界爱好和平的力量，都应该为积极实现苏联关于召开一个全欧会议的建议而努力。
    中国人民不仅关心亚洲的和平，也关心欧洲的和平。我国周恩来总理兼外长在八月十一日所作的外交报告中曾指出：“我们希望，欧洲国家的人民在遭受两次世界战争的灾难之后，能够享受和平生活。欧洲集体安全体系如能建立，将不仅有利于保障欧洲的和平，而且也将有利于保障亚洲及世界的和平。”因此，我国人民热烈拥护苏联关于举行全欧会议的建议，并愿意有自己的观察员出席。
