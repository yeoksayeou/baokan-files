    Efforts to Promote Sino-Italian Friendship and Trade
    Sergio Segre, Member of the Italian Cultural Delegation
    Secretary of the "Center for Promoting Economic and Cultural Relations with China"
    For Italy, restoring relations with China has become an increasingly pressing issue. A broad spectrum of public opinion in our country understands that restoring and developing exchanges with China will provide an attractive prospect for the Italian economy. Business people see this prospect particularly clearly. Because the basic principle of the Chinese People's Government's commercial policy is to conduct the exchange of goods with all countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, Italy can profitably exchange its own products for Chinese products. The concrete steps already taken by other Western countries in this regard vividly illustrate the possibilities that lie before our country.
    Italian intellectuals are eager to restore normal relations with this nation that once had such a glorious ancient culture.
    This desire is deeply felt by the broad public opinion in Italy, so representatives of various parties and groups have joined the ranks of those working to overcome the obstacles that hinder the establishment of relations between the two countries.
    The result of these efforts has promoted the birth of the "Center for Promoting Economic and Cultural Relations with China." The executive committee of this institution is composed of leading figures of various tendencies in the parliament, such as: Socialist Party members Targe (Vice President of the Lower House), Lombardi (former Minister of Transport), Royalist Senator Di la Torreta (former Minister of Foreign Affairs), Ambassador Gaeri Liya (Senator, former Minister of Foreign Affairs), Lower House member Du. Fransasco (President of the University of Milan), Communist Party Senator Tarassini (former Chairman of the Constitutional Conference), Lower House member Ziolitti (former Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs), Senator Duni (former Ambassador), Christian Democratic Party member Gudanti (Minister without Portfolio), Liberal Party Senator Pairadol (former Speaker of the Upper House), Professor Bapi (President of the University of Rome), Senator Jennacon; Non-party member Professor Berry (former Prime Minister), Senator Mol (Vice President of the Upper House).
    In addition to political figures, there are also prominent figures in the Italian cultural world, including university presidents and professors from almost all universities and research institutes in the country. In addition, there are many representatives of the business community. Therefore, the research center can be said to truly represent all political views and all cultural and economic interests.
    Although these people may have their own views on the new Chinese regime, they unanimously believe that different social systems should not prevent the establishment of normal relations between our two countries.
    The visit of the Italian cultural delegation to China has important significance, because on the one hand it represents the "Center for Promoting Economic and Cultural Relations with China," and this center so broadly reflects Italian public opinion, and at the same time because it is the first Italian delegation to visit China.
    The Italian delegation traveled thousands of miles in China from Guangzhou to Anshan, and the touching and enthusiastic hospitality it received everywhere will be unforgettable for the members of the delegation. This is clear proof of the profound sympathy of the Chinese people for the Italian people.
    What moved us most was the enormous scale of construction being carried out by the Chinese people in all areas, and the great achievements they have already made. In these five years, the Chinese people have created many miracles.
    The wounds left by the war have been completely healed. After a period of recovery, the Chinese people have begun to implement the first Five-Year Plan to guide the country's leapfrog development.
    We saw the practical effects of this effort everywhere: we saw the large railway bridge built between Hankou and Hanyang, which is a prelude to another more magnificent railway bridge across the Yangtze River; we saw new buildings being built from the ground up everywhere, for example in Shenyang, we saw new houses built for the first 32,000 residents of a new town, which will be a city with a population of 300,000 when it is fully completed in ten years; we saw new factories being built throughout the country, which shows the Chinese people's determination to change the backwardness caused by the years of oppression and war in old China.
    The living standards of the people have improved; wages have increased, and the consumption of grain and other necessities is growing everywhere. The appearance of this development is visible everywhere, from the clothing of pedestrians to the new bedding and furniture seen in workers' families and in the countryside. In the state-owned stores in major cities, customers are crowded, buying all kinds of goods.
    Not only has the material living standard improved, but the cultural level of the people has also improved. The work of eliminating illiteracy has achieved amazing results. In China, bookstores are the most crowded stores. From large cities to remote rural areas, people from all walks of life read books and periodicals in bookstores, and many people leave the bookstores with armfuls of books they have chosen to buy.
    We found that in addition to a large supply of a wide range of works, there are also the latest technical and scientific books published in various countries around the world.
    We have seen that although the Chinese people have encountered countless difficulties in recent years, the government still cares for and loves the people in every possible way: workers can receive free treatment in large hospitals with modern scientific equipment; the sanatoriums located in beautiful gardens in every place we visited are also free; and the magnificent cultural palaces and clubs attached with theaters, cinemas, stadiums and libraries that carry out various cultural activities are also free.
    What is most touching in the whole country is the care for children: we have seen nurseries in every factory, in the countryside and even in many railway stations, and kindergartens in every village from the smallest to the largest cities, which are always located in the most beautiful and sophisticated places, and there are also facilities for children to play in the parks.
    Although so much has been done so far, the Chinese people still have very arduous tasks ahead of them, and in the years to come they will devote all their efforts to the great work of peaceful construction.
    This is why the Chinese people need a policy of peace, and have automatically undertaken the task of being a major peaceful factor in the international situation.
    During the visit to China, people clearly realized the irrationality and danger of the situation in Taiwan. After Taiwan was recognized by the major countries as part of China's territory, it is now refused to be returned to China, and is being used as a tool to undermine peace in Asia and endanger the world. In this regard, Italy has personal experience, and Italian ships have been robbed by modern pirates on the high seas.
    The value of the huge potential for trade with China that is presented to Italy cannot be ignored; at the same time, it is clear that the embargo policy against China has been harming those who implement it. In fact, it has deprived our country of endless opportunities, and many other countries are already taking advantage of these opportunities.
    We have convincing evidence of how necessary the work of the Italian "Center for Promoting Economic and Cultural Relations with China" is, because we have seen the vast opportunities that will open up for the export of many of our products. These prospects will last for a long time, because the development trend in China is endless. These prospects are not only limited to providing new markets for our products, but also to supplying us with many raw materials, which we currently have to obtain from other markets under harsh conditions.
    The sympathy and respect that the Chinese people have shown for the Italian people will also make it possible to carry out large-scale cultural exchanges in a way that benefits both countries and helps to consolidate friendship and peace between countries.
    For various reasons, the people of the two countries have been isolated from each other, and there is endless work to be done in this regard.
    From the exchange of information and books between academic institutions to the mutual dispatch of delegations and students, song and dance troupes and sports teams, many tasks await us.
    Italian public opinion is eager to know the life and work of the Chinese people, and we have personally seen that there is a similar desire among the Chinese people.
    The warm hospitality we received and what we saw and heard in China tells us that for the benefit of Italy and peace, we must pursue our work with greater determination.

    为促进意中友好和贸易而努力
    意大利文化代表团团员
    “促进对中国的经济与文化关系研究中心”秘书  塞尔乔·塞格雷
    对意大利说来，恢复和中国的关系已成为一个日益迫切的问题。我国的广大公众舆论懂得，恢复并发展同中国的来往将为意大利的经济提供一个引人的前景。工商界人士对这种前景看得尤其清楚。由于中国人民政府的商业政策的基本原则是在平等互惠的基础上同各国进行货物的交换，意大利就可以合算地拿自己的产品来换取中国的产品。其他西方国家在这方面已经采取的具体步骤，生动地说明了在我国面前所展现的这种可能性。
    意大利的知识分子是亟愿和这个曾经有过这样光辉灿烂的古老文化的民族恢复正常关系的。
    这个愿望为意大利广大公众舆论所深深体会到，所以各种不同党派和集团的代表人物都投身到致力克服妨碍了两国建立关系的障碍的队伍中来。
    这些努力的结果，促成了“促进对中国的经济和文化关系研究中心”的诞生。这个机构的执行委员会是由议会中各种不同倾向的领袖人物组成的，例如：社会党党员塔尔盖蒂（下议院副议长）、龙巴迪（前交通部长），保皇党上议员狄拉·托列塔
  （前外交部长）、大使盖瑞里亚（上议员、前外交部长）、下议员杜·弗朗萨斯哥（米兰大学校长）共产党上议员塔拉西尼（前立宪会议主席）、下议员治奥里蒂（前外交部副部长）、上议员杜尼尼
  （前大使），天主教民主党党员古丹蒂（不管部长），自由党上议员派拉多尔（前上议院议长）、巴皮教授（罗马大学校长）、上议员真纳孔；无党派人士柏里教授（前内阁总理）、上议员莫尔（上议院副议长）。
    除了政界人物之外，还有意大利文化界的杰出人物，这包括大学校长和几乎全国所有大学和研究院的教授。此外，还有许多工商界代表人物。因此研究中心可以说是真正代表了一切政治见解以及所有文化和经济利益的。
    这些人尽管在对新中国的政权的看法上可能各有自己的看法，但却一致相信：不同的社会制度不应阻碍我们两国之间建立正常的关系。
    意大利文化代表团的访问中国有着重要的意义，因为它一方面代表了“促进对中国的经济和文化关系研究中心”，而这个中心又是那么广泛地反映了意大利的公众舆论，同时因为它是意大利访问中国的第一个代表团。
    意大利代表团在中国从广州直到鞍山作了几千里的游历，到处所受到的令人感动的热情款待，将是团员们终生难忘的，这是中国人民对意大利人民的深厚同情的明证。
    最使我们感动的，是中国人民在各个方面进行建设的巨大规模，和他们已经获得的伟大成就。在这五年中，中国人民已创造了许多奇迹。
    战争所遗留下来的创伤已经完全治愈了。经过一个恢复时期之后，中国人民已经开始实行引导国家飞跃发展的第一个五年计划。
    我们到处都看见这种努力的实际效果：我们看到了在汉口、汉阳之间修建的大铁桥，它是另一座更宏伟的横跨长江的铁桥的前奏；我们看到了到处都有从平地盖起来的新楼房，例如在沈阳，我们看到了为一个新市镇的首批三万二千居民而建的新住宅，这个新市镇在十年内全部建成后，将是一个拥有三十万人口的城市；我们看到了在全国各地正在兴建中的新工厂，这表明了中国人民要改变遭受压迫与战争的年月给旧中国造成的落后状况的决心。
    人民的生活水平提高了；工资增加了，各地的粮食和其它必需品的消费量在增长。这个发展的外貌是到处都可以看得见的，从行人的衣着上一直到在工人家庭中和农村里见到的新铺盖和家具，都可以看得出来。在各大城市的国营商店里，挤满了购买各种货物的顾客。
    不仅是物质生活水平提高，人民的文化水平也同样提高了。扫除文盲的工作，获得了惊人的成果。在中国，书店是最拥挤的商店。从大城市到偏僻的农村，各阶层的人们在书店里阅览书刊，许多人走出书店时腋下夹满了自己选购的书籍。
    我们发现在书店里除了大量供应极广泛的各种著作之外，还有世界各国出版的最新的技术和科学书籍。
    我们看到，中国人民在这几年中虽然遇到无数的困难，政府依然对人民关怀和爱护备至：工人们可以到具有新式科学设备的大医院里免费治疗；在我们所到过的每个地方的设在景色怡人的园林中的休养所也是免费的；附设有开展各项文化活动的剧院、电影院、运动场和图书馆的壮丽的文化宫、俱乐部也都是免费的。
    在整个国家中最使人感动的，是对儿童们的关怀：我们看到在每个工厂中、在农村里甚至在许多火车站上都有托儿所，从最小的村庄到最大的城市都有幼儿园，它们总是设在最美好和最讲究的地方，同时在公园里也有供儿童们嬉戏的设备。
    虽然到目前为止已做了这许多，在中国人民面前仍然有着很艰巨的任务，在往后的岁月中它将要把全部努力投入和平建设的伟大工作中。
    这就是为什么中国人民需要一个和平的政策，并且自动承担了作为在国际局势中的重大的和平因素的任务。
    在访问中国的期间，人们清楚地认识到台湾局势的不合理和危险。台湾在被各大国承认了是中国的领土的一部分之后，现在却被拒绝归还中国，并且被利用作为破坏亚洲和平，危害世界的工具。在这方面，意大利是有切身的经验的，意大利的船只曾在公海上被现代的海盗劫夺。
    不能忽视展现在意大利面前的同中国贸易的巨大可能性的价值；同时很明显的是，对中国的禁运政策已在危害着那些执行这一政策的人们。实际上，它使我国失去了无穷尽的机会，其它许多国家已经正在利用着这些机会了。
    我们有令人信服的证据证明：意大利“促进对中国的经济和文化关系研究中心”的工作是多么的必要，因为我们看到了将会打开我们许多种产品的输出的广大机会。这些远景将长久地持续下去，因为中国的发展趋势是没有止境的。这些前景还不仅限于给我们的产品提供新的市场，而且还可以给我们供应许多原料，这些原料是我们在目前不得不在苛刻的条件下从其它市场上取得的。
    中国人民所流露出来的对意大利人民的同情和尊重，也将使得有可能在两国互利以及有助于巩固各国之间的友好和和平的情况下，开展大规模的文化交流。
    由于种种缘故，两国人民曾经被人互相隔绝，在这方面是有着无穷尽的工作要做的。
    从学术机构之间的交换情报和书刊，直到互相派遣代表团和留学生、歌舞团和体育队，许多工作在等待着我们去做。
    意大利公众舆论渴望知道中国人民的生活和工作，而我们亲自看到在中国人民中间也有相似愿望。
    我们所受到的热情款待以及我们在中国的见闻，告诉我们：为着意大利的利益和和平，必需以更大的决心来从事我们的工作。
