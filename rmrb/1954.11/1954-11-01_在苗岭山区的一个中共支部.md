In September, I arrived in the Miao Autonomous Region of Leishan County, Guizhou Province, surrounded by mountains. In the mountainous area inhabited by the Miao people, I visited the Xianglou Township branch of the Chinese Communist Party. Like many branches in the Miao Mountains, this branch has led the Miao people in transforming mountain production and has made significant achievements.

Xianglou Township is inhabited by more than 300 Miao peasant households. Before liberation, they suffered from the oppression and devastation of the Kuomintang reactionaries and the landlord class, living a miserable life for many years. In the autumn of 1952, Xianglou Township completed land reform, and the people's government issued a large number of free farm tools and various agricultural loans to help farmers of all ethnic groups overcome production difficulties. At this time, Yu Baoli and two other outstanding Miao farmers, who had been tempered in the mass movement, joined the Communist Party of China. They conscientiously implemented the Party's resolutions and used their exemplary actions to lead Miao farmers on the road of mutual aid and cooperation, organizing four mutual aid teams. By 1953, the mutual aid teams had grown to thirty-four, and the township's grain production increased by 10 percent.

At the beginning of this year's spring plowing, six more outstanding Miao farmers joined the Communist Party of China, and the township's Communist Party members formally organized a Party branch. After the establishment of the branch, it studied how to further develop mountain production and decided to lead Miao farmers to improve production technology on the basis of developing mutual aid and cooperation. Each party member was responsible for leading a village, patiently educating the masses through demonstration. Subsequently, in the six mutual aid teams led by seven party members, the production methods of rice seed selection and seedling cultivation were carried out, which educated the mutual aid team leaders and individual farmers who came to visit, and more than 250 farmer households in the township carried out salt water seed selection. In May, the Party branch called on everyone to practice sparse planting of rice. Eight party members first demonstrated in their own fields, and Communist Party member Yu Lueshan introduced the experience of increased production last year, so that 507 *tiao* of paddy fields in the township implemented sparse planting. The old farmer Yu Shazhai, also under the persuasion and education of Party Branch Secretary Yu Shaluo, eliminated his worries about lodging and happily implemented sparse planting.

Under the leadership of the Party branch, the township newly built and repaired three ditches that could irrigate more than 7,000 *tiao* of paddy fields, turning more than 80 percent of the township's dry land into paddy fields. They also achieved three plowings and three harrows, applying more than four *tiao* of fertilizer per *tiao* of paddy field. Therefore, this year the mutual aid teams and rice fields implementing sparse planting in Xianglou Township generally increased production by more than 10 percent.

Now, the Xianglou Township Party branch of the Communist Party of China is leading Miao farmers to complete the autumn harvest and carry out autumn plowing and planting in an intense manner, while consolidating the existing production mutual aid teams and establishing two agricultural production cooperatives on this basis.

    在苗岭山区的一个中共支部
    新华社记者  杨炫之
    九月里，我到了被群山包围的贵州省雷山县苗族自治区。在苗族人民聚居的山区里，我访问了中共响楼乡支部。这个支部和苗岭山区的许多支部一样，领导苗族人民改造山区生产，已做出了显著的成绩。
    响楼乡聚居着三百多户苗族农民。他们在解放前受尽了国民党反动派和地主阶级的压榨摧残，多少年都过着悲惨的生活。一九五二年秋，响楼乡完成了土地改革，同时人民政府又发给大批无偿农具和各种农业贷款，帮助各族农民克服了生产上的困难。就在这个时候，在群众运动中锻炼出来的余保立等三个优秀苗族农民，参加了中国共产党。他们认真执行党的决议，以自己的模范行动带领苗族农民走互助合作道路，组织了四个互助组。到一九五三年，互助组发展到三十四个，全乡粮食增产百分之十。
    今年春耕开始时，响楼乡又有六个优秀的苗族农民参加了中国共产党，于是全乡的共产党员正式组织了一个党支部。支部组成后，研究了如何进一步发展山区生产，决定领导苗族农民在开展互助合作的基础上提高生产技术；每个党员负责领导一个村子，用示范的方法耐心教育群众。随后，在七个党员领导的六个互助组中，进行了水稻选种和育苗的生产方法，使前来参观的互助组长和单干农民受到了教育，全乡有二百五十多户农民进行了盐水选种。五月间，党支部号召大家实行水稻稀株密植，八个党员首先在自己的田里进行了示范，并由共产党员余略山介绍去年获得增产的经验，于是全乡有五百零七挑田面进行了稀株密植。老农民余沙斋也在支部书记余沙略的说服教育下，消除了害怕倒伏的顾虑，高高兴兴地实行了稀株密植。
    在党支部的领导下，全乡新筑和补修了三条可灌七千多挑田面的水沟，使全乡百分之八十以上的干田变成了水田，并作到三犁三耙，每挑田面施肥四挑以上。因此，今年响楼乡互助组和进行稀株密植的水稻，普遍增产一成以上。
    现在，中共响楼乡党支部正领导苗族农民，紧张结束秋收和开展秋耕秋种工作，一面巩固现有的生产互助组，并在此基础上建立了两个农业生产合作社。
