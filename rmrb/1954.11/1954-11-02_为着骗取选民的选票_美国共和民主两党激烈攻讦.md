    In order to Deceive Voters and Win Their Ballots
    The US Republican and Democratic Parties Fiercely Attack Each Other

    The US congressional midterm elections will be held on November 2nd, and governors of several states will also be re-elected. On the eve of the election, the Republican and Democratic parties' campaign struggle has entered a white-hot stage. In the week before the election, both parties mobilized their maximum strength and delivered campaign speeches everywhere. According to the Republican Party, they plan to deliver more than 250 speeches in 36 states during this week.
    Many American newspapers now predict that the Democratic Party may gain the upper hand in this election. At the same time, the Republican Party is making a final effort to reverse the situation. Most members of the Eisenhower cabinet have been campaigning for Republican candidates everywhere. Eisenhower himself has also changed his original decision not to publicly campaign for individual Republican candidates, and has come out to "travel" to various places and deliver speeches.
    The Republican and Democratic parties are fiercely attacking each other. The Democratic Party is seizing on the bad consequences caused by the Republican government's nearly two years in power to launch attacks. The Democratic Party attacks the Republican government for causing a large number of unemployed people in the United States, reducing people's incomes, falling agricultural product prices, and farmers suffering economic disasters, etc. The Democratic Party does this in an attempt to use the growing dissatisfaction of ordinary American people with the Republican government to deceive and win votes for themselves.
    In addition to boasting about its "achievements" and providing comforting empty promises, the Republican Party is also fighting back against the Democratic Party, attacking the "mess" during the previous Democratic government's rule.
    The entire campaign has become an "ugly boxing match full of slogans, accusations, and abuse," which obscures important issues—this is Democratic leader Stevenson's accusation against Republican campaign tactics. In fact, the Democratic Party itself is exactly the same. Neither the Republican Party nor the Democratic Party is talking about the substantive issues of the United States' domestic and foreign policies in the campaign. The Democratic Party is only attacking the consequences of the Republican Party's implementation of these policies, while avoiding touching on the policies themselves. The Democratic Party and the Republican Party, which both serve American monopoly capital, are originally consistent on these basic policies. Stevenson repeatedly admitted in his speech that most of Eisenhower's legislative proposals in the past were passed in Congress with the support of Democratic Party members.
    Stevenson also made a guarantee in his speech that if a Democratic-controlled Congress is elected, the Democratic Party will support Eisenhower on the basic issues of domestic policy. Democratic Senator Johnson also said that the first item in the Democratic Party's plan after gaining control of Congress will be to ensure cooperation with Eisenhower in foreign policy.
    American voters are very indifferent to this election farce. According to a recent Gallup poll in the United States, only 21 percent of voters are relatively concerned about this election, 19 percent are somewhat concerned, and 60 percent are very little concerned or not concerned at all. An October 25th issue of "Newsweek" reported: "Politicians of both parties are embarrassed by the signs of growing voter indifference. Despite the candidates' vigorous agitation, it seems that in many areas, voter interest cannot be aroused beyond a minimal level. In fact, many people don't seem to care much who wins."

### 为着骗取选民的选票  美国共和民主两党激烈攻讦

    为着骗取选民的选票
    美国共和民主两党激烈攻讦
    【新华社三十一日讯】美国国会中期选举将在十一月二日举行，同时并将改选若干州州长。在选举前夕，共和党和民主党的竞选斗争进入白热化阶段。在选举前夕的一周中，两党都动员了最大的力量，到处发表竞选演说。据共和党方面宣布，在这一周中，共和党计划在美国三十六州发表演说二百五十次以上。
    现在美国许多报刊都预测民主党可能在这次选举中占上风，同时，共和党正在作最后努力，企图挽回局面。艾森豪威尔内阁大多数阁员已四出替共和党候选人捧场。艾森豪威尔自己也改变了他原来不公开出面替个别共和党候选人竞选的决定，跑出来到各地“旅行”，发表演说。
    共和党和民主党相互间正在激烈地进行攻讦。民主党方面抓住共和党政府执政近二年来所造成的恶果，进行攻击。民主党攻击共和党政府使得美国国内失业人数庞大，人民收入减少，农产品价格下跌，农民蒙受经济灾难等。民主党这样做，是企图利用美国普通人民对共和党政府日益增长的不满情绪，而为自己骗取选票。
    共和党除了吹嘘自己的“政绩”、提供安抚人心的空洞诺言外，也对民主党进行还击，攻击前任民主党政府执政时的“一团糟”。
    整个竞选成了“充满口号、指责和谩骂的丑恶的拳赛”，而把重要问题弄模糊起来——这是民主党领袖史蒂文森对共和党竞选手段的指责，实际上民主党自己也是一模一样。无论共和党还是民主党，在竞选中都避而不谈美国对内和对外政策的实质问题。民主党也只是攻击共和党实施这种政策所造成的结果，而避不触及这些政策的本身。同样为美国垄断资本服务的民主党和共和党在这些基本政策上原来就是一致的。史蒂文森在演说中一再承认：大多数艾森豪威尔的立法建议过去在国会中就是依靠民主党议员的支持通过的。
    史蒂文森还在演说中提出保证，如果选出民主党控制的国会，民主党将在对内政策的基本问题上支持艾森豪威尔。民主党参议员约翰逊也说，民主党获得对国会的控制后的计划中的第一项，将是保证在对外政策方面和艾森豪威尔合作。
    美国选民对于这次竞选把戏十分冷淡。据最近美国盖洛普民意测验的统计，对于这次选举，只有百分之二十一选民比较关心，百分之十九还关心一些，而百分之六十极少关心或根本不关心。美国“新闻周刊”十月二十五日的一期报道说：“两党政治家对于日益增长的选民冷淡的迹象感到很窘。尽管候选人用劲煽动，看来在许多地区并不能使选民兴趣超出极微的程度。事实上，许多人民似乎是不大关心谁获胜的。”
