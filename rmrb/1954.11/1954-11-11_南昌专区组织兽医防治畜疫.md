The Nanchang Prefecture Livestock Veterinary Association in Jiangxi Province organized veterinary personnel to prevent and control livestock epidemics and achieved certain results. According to preliminary statistics, in more than five months, they vaccinated over 150,000 head of draught cattle and pigs, and treated over 18,700 head of draught cattle and pigs, basically controlling the spread of animal epidemics and greatly reducing the mortality rate of pigs and cattle. The counties in the flood-stricken areas also organized mobile medical teams for draught cattle, with more than 100 veterinarians participating in the work, treating more than 1,500 head of draught cattle, effectively reducing the mortality of draught animals in the disaster areas, and playing a significant role in restoring production in the disaster areas.
