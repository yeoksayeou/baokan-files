Longxi County's Agricultural-Fruit Integrated Production Cooperatives Achieve Universal Bumper Harvests of Tangerines and Other Fruits

    The "Lighthouse," "May Fourth," and "Increase Production" agricultural and fruit integrated production cooperatives, newly established this year in Longxi County, Fujian, have reported universal bumper harvests of tangerines and various other fruits, with significant improvements in quality. During the tangerine growing season this year, the region experienced a severe drought. Members of the cooperatives worked day and night in shifts to operate water wheels and carry water to irrigate the orchards, overcoming the drought. After their establishment this year, these three cooperatives purchased sprayers and repeatedly sprayed lime-sulfur mixture, effectively preventing damage from rust mites. Last year, farmers in these three cooperatives suffered rust mite damage to approximately 20% of their total tangerine production; this year, the pest has been basically eliminated. The lychees harvested by the three newly established cooperatives this year increased by four to five times compared to when they were working individually last year. This year was a big year for lychees, and coupled with the meticulous management of each cooperative and the capture of tens of thousands of stink bugs, an unprecedented bumper harvest was achieved. This year, the three cooperatives also collectively raised funds to build additional "drying sheds" and other equipment for drying lychees, ensuring that the harvested lychees were promptly dried, and the dried lychees produced were of excellent quality.
    The benefits of agricultural and fruit integrated production cooperatives – high yields, good quality, and high incomes – are deeply desired by nearby farmers, who are actively seeking to join cooperatives. During September and October this year, Longxi County established 110 new agricultural and fruit integrated production cooperatives, bringing the total to 127, including the existing ones. The original old cooperatives have also expanded. Cai Jiuyong, a middle peasant in his fifties from Qitang Village, applied to join the "Increase Production" agricultural production cooperative in Qitang Village four times this spring, but withdrew his application four times for fear of losing out. During the drought that occurred this summer and autumn, he prioritized rice and neglected his tangerines. As a result, the "Increase Production" cooperative had a bumper tangerine harvest, while his production decreased by 30%; the "Increase Production" cooperative's late rice crop overcame the severe drought and achieved a harvest, while he had no harvest. The facts of the past year have educated him, and he has now genuinely joined the cooperative. (Xinhua News Agency)

    龙溪县农果结合的生产合作社
    柑桔等果品普遍丰收
    福建龙溪县今年新建的“灯塔”、“五四”、“增产”等三个农、果结合的生产合作社的柑桔和其他各种水果普告丰收，质量也大有提高。今年柑桔生长期间碰到大旱，合作社的社员们夜以继日地分工车水、挑水灌溉果树园，战胜了旱灾。这三个社今年建社后都购置了喷雾器，数次喷射石灰硫磺合剂，有效地制止了锈壁虱为害。去年这三个社的农民受锈壁虱害的柑桔占总产量百分之二十左右，今年这种虫害已基本铲除。三个新建社今年收获的荔枝，比去年单干时增产四、五倍。今年荔枝是大年，加上各社精心管理，捕捉了几万头椿象虫，因此获得了空前的丰收。今年三个社还集资增建了焙制荔枝干的“焙寮”等设备，使丰收后的荔枝及时上焙，所焙出的荔枝干都很好。
    农、果结合的生产合作社产量高、品质好、收入多的好处，深为附近农民所向往，都积极要求办社。今年九、十月间，龙溪全县新建了一百一十个农、果结合的生产合作社，加上原有的，已达一百二十七个。原有的老社也扩大了。蜞塘村有一个五十多岁的中农蔡玖咏，在今春蜞塘村“增产”农业生产合作社办社时，他曾四次申请入社，但又四次怕吃亏而取消了他入社的申请。今年夏秋间发生旱灾，他顾了水稻顾不上柑桔，结果，“增产”社柑桔丰收，他减产三成；“增产”社的晚稻战胜大旱年获得收成，他没有收成。一年来的事实教育了他，现在他真正入社了。　（新华社）
