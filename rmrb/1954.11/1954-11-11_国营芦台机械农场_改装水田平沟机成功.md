State-Run Lutai Mechanical Farm

Successfully Modifies Paddy Field Ditch Leveler

The staff of the mechanized farming team of the state-run Lutai Farm, directly under the Ministry of Agriculture, have successfully modified a paddy field ditch leveler. The farm originally had Ukr-type ditch levelers, but they swayed from side to side when leveling ditches, making it impossible to fill the ditches properly, and the coverage was too narrow to be convenient. Zhang Ming, the deputy leader of the mechanized farming team, in order to change these shortcomings, added two fixed rudders to the original machine. After testing, it was somewhat better than before, but because it was too close to the plow, it easily accumulated soil. Later, after careful research by drivers Zhao Wei and Feng Shiming, the fixed rudder was moved to the middle. This allowed the ditch leveler to not only avoid swaying, but also cover more than one meter wide of ground. The soil on both sides of the drainage ditch could be leveled into the ditch, allowing tractors to pass unhindered across large tracts of land.

This machine can level 18,000 meters of ditches per day, which can replace the physical labor of 120 people. On the farm's 17,000+ mu of paddy field ditch leveling work, the original requirement of 3,000 manual laborers to complete, could now be completed in just 20 days using this newly modified ditch leveler.

    国营芦台机械农场
    改装水田平沟机成功
    农业部直属国营芦台农场机耕队的职工，改装水田平沟机成功。该场原有乌克派型平沟机，平沟时左右摆动，沟道不能填平，并且揽面太狭，不便使用。机耕队副队长张铭为了改变这些缺点，把原机器加上两个固定方向舵，经过试验比过去好了一些，但因距离翻土板太近，易于拥土。后经驾驶员赵未、冯世明二同志细心钻研，又把固定方向舵移到中间，这样使平沟机既不摆动又能揽一公尺多宽的地面，排水沟两岸的土都可平入沟里，使拖拉机在大片的土地上通行无阻。
    这种机器每日可平沟一万八千公尺，能代替一百二十个人的体力劳动。在该场一万七千余亩水田沟道填平作业上，原需三千个人工才能完成，而用这种新改装成功的平沟机仅二十天内就可全部作完。
