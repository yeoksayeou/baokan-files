    The Huai River Committee Conducts Socio-Economic Survey of Huai River Basin
    Comprehensive Hydrographic Survey of the Western Sichuan Plain Commences
    In order to comprehensively develop the water and land resources of the Huai River Basin, the Huai River Committee of the Ministry of Water Resources has drawn nearly eighty cadres from various departments of its direct organs to form a Socio-Economic Survey Group of the Huai River Basin, which will go to various places along the Huai River to conduct surveys.

    The purpose of this survey is mainly to understand the socio-economic conditions of various provinces in the Huai River Basin, collect various socio-economic survey statistics and development plans, as a basis for preparing the basin plan. The scope of the survey includes the Huai River Basin and the Yi-Shu-Si-Wen area in the four provinces of Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Shandong; the content of the survey includes: society, agriculture, industry and mining, transportation, forestry, animal husbandry, fisheries, salt, as well as the water and drought disaster situation over the years. The entire survey is required to be completed within two months. After studying and discussing relevant documents, the survey team members departed from Bengbu around November 21, heading to Henan, Shandong, Anhui, Jiangsu and other places.

    The Western Sichuan Plain in Sichuan Province has fertile land, suitable for planting crops such as rice, wheat, and rapeseed. However, every summer and autumn, many areas such as the Fujiang and Qujiang areas suffer from floods, and in winter and spring, higher areas such as Pujiang and Qionglai sometimes suffer from drought. In order to solve the threat of drought and flood in this area, the Sichuan Provincial Department of Water Resources dispatched six surveying teams in September and October this year to carry out various hydrographic surveys in the Western Sichuan Plain. Since November, in addition to the original surveying teams continuing to collect topographical and other materials in various places, the Department of Water Resources has also dispatched a team to conduct observations such as triangulation, traverse, and primary leveling control point selection in Guanxian, Pixian, Xinfan, Dayi and other places.

    治淮委员会进行淮河流域社会经济调查
    四川省川西平原水利勘测工作全面展开
    水利部治淮委员会为了全面开发淮河流域的水利和土地资源，特在直属机关各部门抽调近八十名干部，组成淮河流域社会经济调查团，分赴沿淮各地进行调查。
    这次调查的目的，主要是了解淮河流域各省的社会经济情况，搜集各种社会经济调查统计资料及发展计划，以作为编制流域规划的依据。在调查范围上，包括河南、安徽、江苏、山东四省的淮河流域及沂沭泗汶区流域；调查的内容包括：社会、农业、工矿、交通、林、牧、渔、盐以及历年水旱灾情等。全部调查时间要求在两个月内完成。调查团人员经过学习讨论有关文件后，已在十一月二十一日左右由蚌埠出发，分别前往河南、山东、安徽、江苏等地。

    四川省川西平原土地肥沃，适宜种植稻谷、小麦、油菜等作物。但每年夏天和秋天，不少地区如涪江、渠江一带都要遭遇洪水灾害，冬天和春天，在浦江、邛崃等较高地区有时又要受到干旱。为了解决这一地区的旱涝威胁，四川省水利厅在今年九、十月间，先后派出六个测量队，在川西平原地区进行了各项水利勘测工作，从十一月份起，除原各测量队继续在各地进行地形等材料的搜集外，水利厅又增派一个队在灌县、郫县、新繁、大邑等地作三角、导线、主水准选点等观测工作。（李昌善）
