Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, November 2nd: The Cambodian Joint Armistice Commission had to suspend its activities from October 20th because the issue of Cambodian citizens participating in national public life had not been clearly resolved. However, in the final days of the committee's activities, some progress was made on the aforementioned issue.

On October 16, 1954, Cambodian Royal Government Prime Minister Penn Nouth issued an order regarding the issuance of identity cards to demobilized Khmer resistance fighters. According to this order, each Khmer resistance fighter only needs to obtain a certificate issued after demobilization in order to register as a voter. After this, each Khmer resistance fighter will be able to obtain an identity card held by all Cambodian citizens. The certificate issued after demobilization is only temporary and is intended to allow Khmer resistance fighters to participate in national public life.

Regarding this issue, Colonel Thanh Son, chief representative of the General Command of the Khmer Resistance Forces and the delegation of Vietnamese volunteers, pointed out at the meeting of the Joint Armistice Commission held on October 17 that several points in this order should be clarified further. In fact, many Khmer resistance fighters, after being demobilized and returning to their hometowns, did not obtain certificates because they were afraid of being arrested or unwilling to obtain a "surrender certificate" issued by the Royal Government. What about this category of Khmer resistance fighters? Are they allowed to be listed as voters and obtain an identity card? Colonel Thanh Son suggested that the Royal Government devise all possible means to easily achieve the participation of all citizens in national public life without discrimination. He also suggested that the Royal Government not create difficulties for those demobilized Khmer resistance fighters when distributing identity cards and other necessary documents.

The above suggestions of Colonel Thanh Son have been agreed to by the delegation of the General Command of the Royal Cambodian Army.

    柬埔寨王国同意不歧视高棉抗战人员
    【新华社二日讯】据越南通讯社柬埔寨一日讯：柬埔寨联合停战委员会在关于柬埔寨公民参加国家公共生活的问题得到明确解决以前，已不得不从十月二十日起停止活动。但是，在这个委员会最后几天的活动中，上述问题已经得到了一些结果。
    一九五四年十月十六日，柬埔寨王国政府首相彭诺特发表了一项关于把身份证发给那些已经复员的高棉抗战人员的命令。根据这个命令，每一个高棉抗战人员只须领一张在复员以后发给的证明书，以便作为选民登记。在这以后，每一个高棉抗战人员将可以领到一张所有柬埔寨公民都有的身份证。复员以后所发的证明书只是暂时的，目的在于准许高棉抗战人员参加国家公共生活。
    关于这个问题，高棉抗战部队总司令部和越南志愿人员司令部代表团首席代表青山上校在联合停战委员会十月十七日举行的会议上指出，这个命令中有几点应该更清楚地加以说明。事实上，有许多高棉抗战人员在复员返回家乡以后，并没有去领证明书，因为他们怕被逮捕，或是不愿意去领王国政府所发的“投降证明书”。对于这一类的高棉抗战人员怎么办呢？他们是否被准许列为选民并取得一张身份证呢？青山上校建议王国政府想出一切可能的办法，使所有公民毫无歧视地参加国家公共生活这一点能够很容易地实现。他还建议，王国政府在分发身份证和其他必要的证件时，不要给那些已复员的高棉抗战人员制造困难。
    青山上校的上述建议已得到柬埔寨王国军队总司令部代表团的同意。
