No More Famine Relief Needed
Chen Lida, Zhu Shimei

    Wenjia Township, Lixian County, Hunan Province, suffered a once-in-a-century flood this year. The water was three feet deep on the plains, and the rice and cotton were ruined.

    The frequent floods before liberation left a very tragic impression in the minds of the people of Wenjia Township.

    Not to mention the distant past, let's just talk about the situation after the disaster in 1948. That year, as soon as the disaster struck, the landlords and profiteers smiled. Ran Dacheng immediately opened a rice shop on Yujia Tai Street. He knew that the farmers were waiting for rice to cook, so he quoted prices arbitrarily. At the same time, the rice bought from him was only nine 合 per 升. The rice grains were soaked in water until they were like cooked rice grains, and they turned into powder when squeezed.

    That year, many disaster-stricken farmers had no food to eat in their hometown, so they had to go to other places for famine relief. Zhou Naizhong, a middle peasant, reluctantly sent his sixteen-year-old eldest daughter to a rich peasant's house to be a child bride, and sent his fourteen-year-old eldest son to another village to herd cattle. He asked his wife to take his three younger children out for famine relief, and they only returned after begging for food for a few months. This was considered "lucky." Some people who went out for famine relief have not been heard from since, and it is not known whether they are dead or alive.

    This year, the flood was bigger than in previous years. The biggest concern for the farmers in Wenjia Township was: would the price of grain rise? Some older people, thinking of the past, were afraid and prepared to take the old road of famine relief. Li Yuanhu's family of five had packed their luggage and planned to escape into the mountains for famine relief. He said sadly: "Famine relief is not a good way out. But without food, we have no choice!"

    However, this year is not 1948. The cadres of the CCP branch and the district office told the farmers: This year, the state has implemented the unified purchase and sale of grain, and the government can guarantee the supply of rations. As a result, the uneasy hearts of the people began to settle down, and Li Yuanhu reopened his packed luggage. Some people were still a little doubtful at this time: This year's disaster is so big, can the government provide so much grain? This doubt was quickly broken by the facts. Grain was transported in large quantities, and households lacking grain immediately received supplies. The elderly who were preparing for famine relief said one after another, both happily and ashamed: The old eyes really can't see the new world!

    Zhou Naizhong, mentioned earlier, suffered a much heavier disaster this year than in 1948. The government supplied him with more than 900 catties of rice and also gave him relief money. His family's life can be maintained, and they no longer have to scatter everywhere. Relying on the strength of everyone in the mutual aid group, he drained the water from the high fields and planted three mu of buckwheat and one mu of late rice. After the government supplied Li Yuanhu with 600 catties of rice, he also completely settled down to carry out production self-rescue. Now, he has planted three mu of buckwheat and one mu of grass seeds. He said: "Food is not a problem, and production has already started. We don't need to go for famine relief anymore!"

    How did these benefits come about? The farmers in Wenjia Township all know that this is because: first, today's government is the people's own government; second, the country has now implemented the good policy of unified purchase and sale of grain. When the middle peasant Mo Jiazhong implemented the unified purchase of grain last year, he couldn't understand it in his heart. He reluctantly sold 500 catties of surplus grain, and sometimes complained:
  "The government does everything well, except for this one thing." After this disaster, the government supplied him with 400 catties of rice. He said:
  "The method of unified purchase and sale is really good, otherwise where can we buy rice, and where can we eat such cheap rice!" A few days ago, when he wanted to buy grass seeds to plant, because the supply and marketing cooperative did not prepare enough, the profiteers took the opportunity to raise prices, and he also said angrily: "It would be great if grass seeds were also subject to unified purchase and sale!"

    When Fang Yejing, the secretary of the CCP branch in Wenjia Township, discussed the benefits of the unified purchase and sale of grain with us, he excitedly calculated two accounts for us. The first account is that, after this year's flood, the state has already supplied Wenjia Township with 360,000 catties of rice, and the price per catty has always been more than 780 yuan; if the unified purchase and sale of grain had not been implemented, the price of grain would inevitably fluctuate, and if it was 100 yuan more expensive per catty, the households lacking grain in the whole township would have to pay 36 million yuan more. The second account is that, because the state supplied enough rations, the farmers in the whole township were able to concentrate on production and self-rescue, drained the water from more than 2,000 mu of fields, and rushed to plant more than 1,100 mu of late rice, more than 1,000 mu of buckwheat, plus more than 2,000 mu of barley, wheat, etc., the people in the whole township can solve three and a half months of rations.

    Fang Yejing said excitedly: "You tell me, with these things alone, can the farmers not support the policy of unified purchase and sale? This year, the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain saved Wenjia Township. Next year, we must sell more surplus grain to the state and use practical actions to support the policy of unified purchase and sale!"

    再不用逃荒了
    陈立达　朱世美
    湖南省澧县温家乡今年遭了百年未有的大水灾，平地水深三尺，稻子和棉花都被淹坏了。
    解放前连年的水灾，在温家乡人民的心里留下了极其悲惨的印象。
    久远的事情不说，单说一九四八年受灾后的景况吧。那年刚一遭灾，地主、奸商就眉开眼笑了。冉大成马上在余家台街上开了一个米店。他晓得农民家里等着米下锅，要起价钱来便信口开河。同时，从他那里买的米，一升只有九合，米粒子用水发得跟饭粒子一样，一捏就成了粉末。
    那年，许多遭了灾的农民，在本乡没有饭吃，只好到外地去逃荒。中农周乃忠，忍痛把十六岁的大女儿送到富农家里做童养媳，把十四岁的大儿子送到外乡去放牛，叫老婆带着三个小儿女出去逃荒，讨了几个月饭才回来。这还算是“运气好”的。有的人逃荒出去，至今还没有音讯，不知道是死是活。
    今年，水灾比往年大。温家乡农民最担心的一个问题就是：粮价会不会涨？有些年纪大的人，想到过去的情形，害怕起来了，准备走逃荒的老路。李远湖全家五口人，把行李都收拾好了，打算往山里逃荒。他沉痛地说：“逃荒不是好出路。没有粮食，也只好这样！”
    但是，今年不是一九四八年了。中共支部和区公所的干部们向农民说：今年国家实行了粮食统购统销，政府可以保证供应口粮。于是，惶惶不安的人心开始安定了，李远湖把捆好的行李重新打开。有些人这时候还有点怀疑：今年这么大的灾，政府拿得出这么多粮食吗？这个怀疑很快也被事实打破了，粮食大批大批地运来，缺粮的户马上得到了供应。原来准备逃荒的老年人，一个个又喜欢又惭愧地说：老眼光真是看不清新世界啊！
    前面谈到的周乃忠，今年遭的灾比一九四八年重得多。政府供应给他九百多斤大米，还发给他救济款，一家人的生活可以维持，再也不用东逃西散了。他依靠互助组里大伙的力量，排掉高田渍水，种上三亩荞麦、一亩晚稻。李远湖在政府供应给他六百斤大米以后，也完全安下心来进行生产自救了。现在，他已经种了三亩荞麦、一亩草籽。他说：“粮食不成问题，生产也已经搞起来，我们都不用再逃荒了！”
    这些好处是怎么得来的呢？温家乡的农民都知道，这是因为：第一、今天的政府是人民自己的政府，第二、现在国家实行了粮食统购统销这个好政策。中农莫家忠在去年实行粮食统购的时候，心里想不通，勉强卖了五百斤余粮，有时还发点牢骚：
  “政府桩桩事情都办得好，就是这件事情没办好。”这次遭灾以后，政府供应给他四百斤大米。他说：
  “统购统销的办法真好，不然向哪里买米，哪里又有这样便宜的米吃！”前些日子他要买草籽种的时候，因为供销合作社准备的数量不足，奸商便乘机抬高价钱，他还生气地说：“草籽也实行统购统销就好了！”
    温家乡的中共支部书记方业镜和我们谈论粮食统购统销的好处的时候，兴奋地给我们算了两笔账。第一笔账是，国家在今年水灾以后，已经供应给温家乡三十六万斤大米，每斤的价钱一直是七百八十多元；如果不是实行粮食统购统销，粮价难免就要波动，如果每斤贵出一百元，全乡缺粮户就得多付出三千六百万元。第二笔账是，由于国家供应了足够的口粮，全乡农民能够专心生产自救，排干了两千多亩田的渍水，抢种了一千一百多亩晚稻、一千多亩荞麦，再加上两千多亩大麦、小麦等，全乡的人可以解决三个半月的口粮。
    方业镜激动地说：“你们讲，就凭这些事情，农民们能够不拥护统购统销政策吗？今年，粮食统购统销政策救了温家乡。明年，我们一定要把更多的余粮卖给国家，用实际行动来拥护统购统销政策！”
