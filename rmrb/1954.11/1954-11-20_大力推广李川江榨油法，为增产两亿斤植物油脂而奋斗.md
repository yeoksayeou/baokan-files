    Vigorously Promote Li Chuanjiang's Oil Pressing Method and Strive to Increase Vegetable Oil Production by 200 Million Jin
    Wang Yizhi, Deputy Director of the Light Industry Bureau, Ministry of Light Industry
    The current basic situation of the oil industry is: the development of production cannot keep up with the needs of the people's lives; on the one hand, there is a shortage of oil materials, and on the other hand, the existing raw materials are not fully utilized, and waste is still very common. Especially this year, some rural areas have suffered from floods, and oil crops have decreased in production, so the supply of oil materials will be even more tense next year. In order to further meet the needs of the people's lives and industrial oil consumption, the National Oil Industry Advanced Experience Exchange Conference determined that the production policy of the national oil industry in 1955 should be: vigorously promote Li Chuanjiang's soybean oil pressing method, try out peanut oil pressing method and cottonseed oil pressing method and other advanced oil pressing experiences, actively improve operation and management, strengthen technical management and planning management, and strive to increase production and save 200 million jin of vegetable oil throughout the year under the conditions of ensuring product quality, safe production and reducing costs!
    Is it possible to increase production and save 200 million jin of vegetable oil? China's oil industry has not yet made good use of national resources, and the oil yield of oil factories and oil workshops varies greatly from place to place. For example, the oil content of every 100 jin of soybeans is about 17 jin, while the oil yield of every 100 jin of raw materials in various places is: the average of 14 oil workshops in Jiaozhou area of Shandong is 13 to 14 jin, the average of Henan, Shanxi, Shandong, Anhui and other provinces is 11 to 12 jin, the average of Jiangsu, Shaanxi and other provinces is about 10.5 jin, and the average of Hubei Province is 8.5 jin. For example, the oil content of every 100 jin of peanut kernels is 46 to 50 jin, while the oil yield of every 100 jin of raw materials in various places is: the average of Shanxi Province is about 41.5 jin, the average of Guangdong, Hunan, Shandong and other provinces is a little more than 40 jin, the average of Henan Province is 39 jin, the average of Jiangsu Province is a little more than 36 jin, and the average of Anhui Province is 34 jin. The oil yield of every 100 jin of cottonseed also differs by about 6 jin in various places, and the oil yield of every 100 jin of rapeseed differs by about 10 jin in various places. It can be seen that the potential power of the oil industry is very great, and the possibility of increasing production and saving is fully existent. At the same time, thanks to the great attention of leaders at all levels, the processing methods have been improved, and the promotion of Li Chuanjiang's oil pressing method and other advanced experiences, with the joint assistance of various departments concerned for seven months, some experience has been accumulated. These are all favorable conditions to ensure the completion of the increase in production and savings of 200 million jin of vegetable oil.
    The basic link to increase production by 200 million jin of vegetable oil without increasing raw materials is: vigorously promote Li Chuanjiang's oil pressing method, and try out spiral peanut oil pressing method and cottonseed oil pressing method to increase the oil yield of raw materials.
    Li Chuanjiang's oil pressing method was produced in the Northeast Local State-owned Siping Oil and Wine Factory in 1952. From April to July 1953, the Northeast Local Industry Bureau concentrated more than 50 advanced producers, technicians, and management cadres from 23 oil factories to conduct pilot projects in the Dalian Oil and Grease General Factory, which was further summarized and improved. After the promotion in the entire Northeast region, the average oil yield of every 100 jin of soybeans increased to 12.47 in 1953, and the average oil yield of soybeans reached 12.8 jin by the end of September 1954, of which the Dalian Oil and Grease General Factory and the Siping Oil and Wine Factory had reached about 14.5 jin. The Central Ministry of Light Industry and the Light Industry Trade Union Working Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions held a small symposium on the promotion of advanced oil pressing methods in Beijing on March 15 this year. Subsequently, the relevant departments respectively selected key factories in East China, Central South China, and North China to test and promote Li Chuanjiang's oil pressing method. Now the facts have proved that all oil factories that have correctly promoted Li Chuanjiang's oil pressing method have increased the oil yield of every 100 jin of raw materials. Taking the 30 local state-owned factories in East China as an example, soybeans have increased by an average of 0.74 jin, peanuts have increased by an average of 3.19 jin, rapeseed has increased by an average of 1.23 jin, and cottonseed has increased by an average of 0.77 jin. The oil factories affiliated to the Shandong Provincial Department of Industry have also increased: soybeans generally increased by 1 jin to 2 jin, and the most increased by 3 jin; cottonseed generally increased by more than 2 jin; peanuts increased by an average of 4 jin to 5 jin. After the oil factories in Jiangsu Province initially promoted Li Chuanjiang's oil pressing method, the oil yield also generally increased by 1 to 2 jin. The oil yield of every 100 jin of raw materials in factories in Zhejiang Province and Henan Province that initially promoted Li Chuanjiang's oil pressing method has also increased.
    In the oil factories of automatic screw machines, due to the promotion of Li Chuanjiang's oil pressing method and related advanced experiences, the oil yield of every 100 jin of raw materials was increased and the residual oil in the oil cake was reduced. For example, the residual oil content in peanut cake of Qingdao Oil Factory decreased from 5.93 to 4.66 jin, and the residual oil content in hemp cake of Baotou Flaxseed Oil Factory decreased from 5.78 jin in May to 5.41 jin in June, of which one machine dropped to an average of 5.01 jin. The five oil factories of Baoding, Zhangjiakou, Shijiazhuang, Tongxian, and Handan affiliated to the Hebei Provincial Department of Industry produced 68 tons more oil from May to September due to the promotion of Li Mengshui's advanced experience in safe production operation methods. The residual oil content in the cake of every 100 jin of cottonseed in Tianjin China Oil and Grease Chemical Factory also decreased from 8 jin in April to 5.77 jin in September.
    The above facts show the superiority of Li Chuanjiang's oil pressing method. Its basic principles and several key points are not only applicable to large oil factories, hydraulic presses and manual screw machines throughout the country, but also can be applied to native oil workshops and automatic screw machines; not only applicable to soybean oil pressing, but also can be applied to peanut, cottonseed oil pressing, etc.; not only applicable to oil factories in the Northeast, but also applicable to oil factories throughout the country.
    The problem now is to promote comprehensively, vigorously, with organization, leadership, key points, and differentiation. The so-called leadership means that there should be plans, inspections, summaries, and beginnings and ends; organization means that there should be responsibility at all levels, mutual combination, and this work should be carried out step by step and in an orderly manner; key points mean that different types of oil factories and oil workshops in different regions should be distinguished, and different work priorities should be determined; differentiation means that the different conditions of various places and factories should be distinguished, and Li Chuanjiang's oil pressing method, spiral peanut oil pressing method and cottonseed oil pressing method should be correctly used in combination with the specific conditions of the place and factory; comprehensively means that universal and in-depth promotion is required, and no matter what region, equipment, or raw material, large and small oil factories should be promoted without exception; vigorously means that a positive attitude should be adopted and the promotion should be carried out seriously and practically. At the same time, the promotion of advanced experience must be combined with the establishment and strengthening of technical management, and must achieve cost reduction and increased income, and create conditions for cost accounting.
    To promote advanced experience and carry out technical innovation movement in the oil industry, we must first do a good job in ideological and political work. The ideological obstacles to the promotion of advanced experience in the oil industry are mainly that some administrative cadres, technicians, and technical workers have various conservative ideas and complacency in their minds. This is manifested in the fact that some people overemphasize the special and look down on the advanced experience of other factories. They superficially admit that Li Chuanjiang's operation method is good, but in fact, they think that the machines in their factory are different and cannot be applied. Some people superficially admit that Li Chuanjiang's operation method is good and also say that they want to promote it, but there are no specific measures and no one is responsible, which is actually a passive attitude. Some people think that their factory is large and the equipment is good, and they want to create their own set. They are unwilling to learn even if others have good experience. Some people simply emphasize that the processing contract is unreasonable, and think that further improving the oil yield of raw materials is harmful to the factory, so they blindly pursue the amount of pressing, which affects the oil yield and causes great waste. Some people doubt that other factories are advanced, do not face up to the backward phenomena in their own factories, stick to the old ways and refuse to make progress. Some people think that the oil industry has low income, many difficulties, and simple equipment, and has no great future, and take a passive and wait-and-see attitude towards the promotion of advanced experience. The above ideas often become the main obstacles to the promotion of advanced experience. Therefore, the above-mentioned conservative ideas and complacency must be overcome in a timely manner in order to effectively implement advanced experience. The solution is: repeatedly carry out persuasive education on specific ideas, and explain the advantages and disadvantages with examples; organize appropriate personnel to visit advanced factories and conduct practical education with advanced deeds; break conservative ideas with typical examples in our own factories; carry out criticism and self-criticism, promote advanced ideas, overcome complacency, promote collectivist spirit, and oppose individual limelightism.

    大力推广李川江榨油法，为增产两亿斤植物油脂而奋斗
    轻工业部轻工业管理局副局长  王毅之
    目前油脂工业的基本情况是：生产的发展赶不上人民生活的需要；一方面油料供应不足，另一方面现有的原料又没有充分利用，浪费还很普遍。特别是今年有部分农村遭受水灾，油料作物减产，所以明年油料的供应更加紧张。为了进一步满足人民生活的需要以及工业生产用油，全国油脂工业先进经验交流大会确定一九五五年全国油脂工业生产的方针应该是：大力推广李川江大豆榨油法，试行花生榨油法和棉籽榨油法及其他榨油的先进经验，积极改善经营管理，加强技术管理和计划管理，在保证产品质量、安全生产和降低成本的条件下，为全年增产节约二亿斤植物油而奋斗！
    增产节约二亿斤植物油有没有可能呢？我国油脂工业还没有很好地利用国家资源，各地油厂和油坊产油率高低悬殊甚大。例如每百斤大豆的含油量为十七斤左右，而现在各地每百斤原料的产油量则是：山东胶州专区的十四个油坊平均十三到十四斤，河南、山西、山东、安徽等省平均十一斤到十二斤，江苏、陕西等省平均十斤半左右，湖北省平均八斤半。又如每百斤花生仁含油量是四十六到五十斤，而现在各地每百斤原料的产油量则是：山西省平均四十一斤半左右，广东、湖南、山东等省平均四十斤多一点，河南省平均三十九斤，江苏省平均三十六斤多一点，安徽省平均三十四斤。每百斤棉籽的产油量各地也相差六斤左右，每百斤菜籽的产油量各地相差十斤左右。由此可见油脂工业的潜在力量是很大的，增产节约的可能性是充分存在的。同时由于各级领导都很重视，加工办法有所改善，李川江榨油法和其他先进经验的推广，七个月来在各有关部门共同协助下，积累了一些经验。这些都是保证完成增产节约两亿斤植物油的有利条件。
    在不增加原料的条件下，增产两亿斤植物油的基本环节是：大力推广李川江榨油法，并试行螺旋机花生榨油法和棉籽榨油法，提高原料产油量。
    李川江榨油法一九五二年产生于东北地方国营四平油酒制造厂，一九五三年四月至七月，经东北地方工业局集中了二十三个油厂的先进生产者、技术人员、管理干部五十多人在旅大油脂总厂进行试点，得到了进一步的总结和提高。东北全区推广以后，一九五三年每百斤大豆产油量平均提高到十二点四七，一九五四年九月底止大豆产油量平均已达到十二点八斤，其中旅大油脂总厂和四平油酒制造厂已达十四点五斤左右。中央轻工业部和中华全国总工会轻工业工会工作委员会于今年三月十五日在北京召开了小型的推广先进榨油法座谈会。接着，各有关部门就分别在华东、中南、华北选择重点工厂试验推广李川江榨油法。现在事实证明：凡是正确地推广了李川江榨油法的油厂，每百斤原料产油量都有提高，以华东地方国营三十个厂为例，大豆平均提高零点七四斤，花生平均提高三点一九斤，菜籽平均提高一点二三斤，棉籽平均提高零点七七斤。山东省工业厅所属各油厂也有提高：大豆一般提高了一斤至二斤，最多的提高了三斤；棉籽一般的提高了二斤以上；花生平均提高了四斤到五斤。江苏省各油厂，初步推广了李川江榨油法后，产油量也普遍提高了一至二斤。浙江省、河南省初步推广了李川江榨油法的工厂，每百斤原料的产油量也都有所提高。
    在自动螺旋机的油厂里，也由于推广了李川江榨油法和有关的先进经验，提高了每百斤原料的产油量，降低了油饼中残油，如青岛油厂花生饼中残油量由五点九三降至四点六六斤，包头胡麻油厂麻饼中残油量由五月份五点七八斤降至六月份五点四一斤，其中一台机降到平均五点零一斤，河北工业厅所属保定、张家口、石家庄、通县、邯郸五个油厂由于推广了李孟水安全生产操作法的先进经验，五月至九月多产油六十八吨。天津中国油脂化学厂每百斤棉籽的饼中残油量也由四月份的八斤降至九月份的五点七七斤。
    上述事实说明了李川江榨油法的优越性。它的基本原理和若干要领，不但适用于全国的大型油厂、水压机和人力螺旋机，也能够运用于土榨油坊和自动螺旋机；不但适用于大豆榨油，也可以运用于花生、棉籽榨油等；不但适用于东北的油厂，而且也适用于全国各地油厂。
    现在的问题在于要有组织、有领导、有重点、有区别地全面、大力推广。所谓有领导就是要有计划有检查有总结，有始有终；有组织就是要层层负责，相互结合，有步骤有秩序的进行这一工作；有重点就是要区别不同地区不同类型的油厂和油坊，确定不同的工作重点；有区别就是要区别各地各厂的不同条件，结合该地该厂的具体情况正确运用李川江榨油法，试行螺旋机花生榨油法和棉籽榨油法；全面就是要求普遍深入的推广，不管那个地区那种设备那种原料的大小油厂均应无例外地加以推广；大力就是要采取积极态度，认真地切实地去推广。同时，推广先进经验必须同建立和加强技术管理相结合，必须做到降低成本，增加收入，为成本核算创造条件。
    在油脂工业中推广先进经验，开展技术革新运动，必须首先做好思想政治工作。油脂工业中推广先进经验的思想障碍主要是某些行政干部、技术人员、技术工人等思想上存在着各色各样的保守思想和骄傲自满情绪。这表现在有的人过分强调特殊，看不起别厂先进经验，表面承认李川江操作法好，实则认为本厂机器不同，不能适用。有的人表面承认李川江操作法好，也表示要推广，但没有具体措施，无人负责，实际上乃是消极态度。有的人认为自己厂大，设备好，想独创一套，别人虽有好经验也不愿学。有的人单纯强调加工合同不合理，认为再提高原料产油量对工厂有害无利，于是盲目的追求压榨量，影响了产油量，造成了极大浪费。有的人怀疑别厂先进，不正视本厂的落后现象，故步自封，不愿学习别人，不求进步。有的人认为油脂工业收入少，困难多，设备简陋，没大前途，对推广先进经验采取了消极观望的态度。上述思想往往成为推广先进经验的主要障碍。因此，对于上述保守思想和骄傲自满情绪，必须及时地予以克服，才能够把先进经验切实地贯彻下去。解决的办法是：针对具体思想反复进行说服教育，以实例说明利害；组织适当人员赴先进厂参观，以先进事迹进行实际教育；以本厂的典型事例打破保守思想；开展批评与自我批评，发扬先进思想，克服骄傲自满情绪，发扬集体主义精神，反对个人风头主义思想。
