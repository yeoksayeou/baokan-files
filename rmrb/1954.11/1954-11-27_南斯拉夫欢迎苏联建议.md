Xinhua News Agency report:
    The Yugoslav Foreign Ministry handed over the Yugoslav government's reply to the Soviet Union's November 13 note to the Soviet Embassy in Yugoslavia on the 24th.

    The reply stated that the issues discussed in the Soviet government's proposal are issues that the Yugoslav government attaches great importance to. The Yugoslav government welcomes and supports the proposal made by the Soviet government to hold a conference, as well as the fact that this proposal has been made to twenty-three countries, and believes that holding such a conference in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter will make a significant contribution to easing international tensions.

    The reply stated that the Yugoslav government considered: "At present, the opinions of some European countries on many issues of common concern are far apart, and many European countries are not prepared to participate in the aforementioned conference at this time," and therefore believes that if this conference were held at a later date than the date proposed by the Soviet Union, it would not be too late.

    南斯拉夫欢迎苏联建议
    据新华社讯：南斯拉夫外交部二十四日把南斯拉夫政府对苏联十三日照会的复照交给苏联驻南斯拉夫大使馆。
    复照说，苏联政府建议中所谈到的问题都是南斯拉夫政府非常重视的问题，南斯拉夫政府欢迎和支持苏联政府建议中提出的举行会议的主张以及已向二十三个国家提出这个建议的事实，并且认为，根据联合国宪章的原则，来举行这样一次会议将对缓和国际紧张局势作出重大贡献。
    复照表示，南斯拉夫政府考虑到：“目前一些欧洲国家在许多共同有关的问题上的意见彼此距离很远，而且许多欧洲国家不准备在现在参加上述的会议”，因而认为，如果这次会议在比苏联建议的日期晚些时候召开，也不算太晚。
