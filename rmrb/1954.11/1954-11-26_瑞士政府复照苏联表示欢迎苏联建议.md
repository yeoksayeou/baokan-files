Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 25th: According to TASS, the Swiss Minister to Moscow delivered the Swiss government's reply to the Soviet note of November 13th to the Soviet Foreign Ministry on the 24th.

The reply first thanks the Soviet government for sending the note to Switzerland and welcomes the Soviet government's proposal "to establish a lasting system of peace and security throughout the world, especially in Europe."

The reply emphasizes Switzerland's "permanent neutral status," stating that Switzerland "cannot participate in any collective security system incompatible with this status."

However, the reply states: The Swiss government believes that some of the issues raised in the Soviet note are consequences of the last war and are caused by the lack of a peace treaty. Therefore, these issues should be studied and discussed by the governments of the countries concerned.

The reply further states: As long as "the issues in which Switzerland should not participate in the discussion are resolved, or the countries directly related to these issues agree to convene a conference to establish a European security system," the Swiss government is prepared to consider Switzerland's participation in a pan-European conference and in the effort, within the scope of permanent neutrality, to establish a system of peace and security in which all European countries participate.

    瑞士政府复照苏联表示欢迎苏联建议
    【新华社二十五日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十五日讯：瑞士驻莫斯科公使二十四日把瑞士政府对十一月十三日苏联照会的复照交给苏联外交部。
    复照首先感谢苏联政府送致瑞士照会，并欢迎苏联政府“为在全世界、特别是在欧洲建立起持久的和平和安全体系”而提出的建议。
    复照强调瑞士“的永久中立地位”，说瑞士“不能参加任何和这种地位不相合的集体安全体系”。
    但是复照说：瑞士政府认为，苏联照会中所提出的某些问题是上一次战争的后果，是由于还没有缔结和约而引起的。因此，这些问题应该由有关国家的政府来研究和讨论。
    复照又说：只要“瑞士所不应参与讨论的那些问题获得解决，或是和这些问题直接有关的国家同意召开建立欧洲安全体系的会议”，瑞士政府就准备考虑瑞士参加全欧会议以及在永久中立的范围内协同努力建立一切欧洲国家都参加的和平和安全体系的问题。
