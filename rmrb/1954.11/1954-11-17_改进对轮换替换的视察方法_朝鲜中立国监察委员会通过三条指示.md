Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 15th. At the November 2nd meeting of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea, the four-nation committee jointly passed three directives to each neutral nations inspection team regarding the issue of improving inspection methods for rotation and replacement. It also instructed each team to begin work in accordance with these three directives.

The three directives passed by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission this time clearly stipulate: teams should require local authorities to provide prior notice before carrying out personnel rotations and replacement of war materials; in addition to inspections based on these prior notices, teams should also conduct random checks at any time; the directives also put forward improved methods for the teams to report to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission after inspections.

Regarding prior notification, the directive states: teams should require local authorities to submit written notice "approximately three hours before" rotated military personnel and replaced war materials "enter or leave Korean seaports and stations". Regarding inspections of air transport, "teams should require prior notification that allows them ample opportunity to conduct appropriate inspections." Regarding spot checks, the directive states:
  "Teams should conduct spot check inspections within their port area at any time when they deem it necessary." "The conduct of spot check inspections, taking into account local conditions, should always ensure suddenness."

Since the teams of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission began working at the northern ports last year, they have consistently received assistance and cooperation from the Korean and Chinese sides. The Korean and Chinese sides have provided the teams with accurate notifications before each rotation and replacement. The teams have also carried out spot checks at any time with the help of the Korean and Chinese sides. However, the neutral nations inspection teams stationed at the southern ports have often been subjected to some restrictions by the U.S. side during their inspection work, especially since the U.S. side unilaterally announced and implemented the so-called "new methods" on April 15th of this year, the team's inspection work has been further restricted.

The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission has made long-term efforts to improve the inspection work of each team. On September 22nd of this year, the Czechoslovakian commissioner submitted a draft proposal on improving the inspection methods of each port team at the meeting of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. The four-nation committee conducted multiple discussions on this draft proposal and finally reached a consensus, passing the three directives on inspection methods.

### 改进对轮换替换的视察方法  朝鲜中立国监察委员会通过三条指示

    改进对轮换替换的视察方法
    朝鲜中立国监察委员会通过三条指示
    【新华社开城十五日电】在朝鲜中立国监察委员会十一月二日的会议上，四国委员共同就改进对轮换替换的视察方法问题通过了对各中立国视察小组的三条指示；并指令各小组开始遵照这三条指示进行工作。
    中立国监察委员会这次通过的三条指示中明确规定：小组应要求地方当局在进行军事人员的轮换和作战物资的替换以前提出事先通知；小组除根据这些事先通知进行视察外，并应随时进行抽查；指示中还对小组在视察后向中立国监察委员会进行报告的工作，提出了改进办法。
    关于事先通知，指示中说：小组应要求地方当局不迟于轮换的军事人员和替换的作战物资“进出朝鲜海港和车站前三小时左右”提出书面通知。对于空运的视察，“小组应要求能使其有充分可能进行适当视察的事先通知”。关于抽查，指示中说：
  “小组应在其认为需要时，随时在其口岸范围内进行抽查视察。”“抽查视察的进行，在考虑到当地情况的条件下，应该始终保证是具有突然性的。”
    中立国监察委员会在北方各口岸的小组自去年开始工作以来，就一直得到朝中方面的帮助和合作。朝中方面在每次轮换替换以前都向小组提出精确的通知。各小组也在朝中方面的帮助下实行了随时抽查。但是，驻南方各口岸的中立国视察小组在进行视察工作时，却经常受到美方的一些限制，特别是从今年四月十五日美方片面宣布并实行所谓“新办法”以后，小组的视察工作受到了进一步的限制。
    中立国监察委员会为了改进各小组的视察工作，曾经进行了长期的努力。今年九月二十二日，捷克斯洛伐克委员在中立国监察委员会会议上提出了一个改进各口岸小组视察方法的草案，四国委员就这个草案进行了多次的讨论，最后取得了一致的意见，通过了关于视察方法的三条指示。
