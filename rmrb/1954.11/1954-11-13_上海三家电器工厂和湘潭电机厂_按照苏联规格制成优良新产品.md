Shanghai's Three Electrical Appliance Factories and Xiangtan Motor Factory Produce Excellent New Products According to Soviet Specifications

Xinhua News Agency

The main products of Shanghai's three largest electrical factories – Shanghai Motor Factory, Shanghai Wire Factory, and Huatong Switch Factory – are now manufactured according to Soviet specifications. According to incomplete statistics, this year these three factories have designed and manufactured approximately 500 types of electrical switches, over 50 types of wires and cables, and hundreds of types of generators, motors, and transformers based on Soviet blueprints, physical objects, or with reference to Soviet technical data.

The technical level of these three factories has significantly improved by manufacturing products according to Soviet specifications. The Shanghai Wire Factory, which before liberation could only produce a few types of civilian-use braid wires and flexible cords, trial-produced 40 new products according to Soviet specifications last year and has continued to trial-produce nearly 30 more this year. The 10,000-volt paper-insulated power cables trial-produced for the construction of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company are now in mass production. This factory has also manufactured telephone cables for large cities such as Beijing, capable of handling 2,400 simultaneous conversations. It has also trial-produced trapezoidal copper bars for 10,000 kW generators, non-combustible rubber-sheathed cables for shipbuilding, and ignition wires for aircraft and automobile engines, all for the electrical, shipbuilding, and the under-construction aviation and automotive industries. The Shanghai Motor Factory and Huatong Switch Factory, which originally had a mixture of product specifications and incomplete varieties, have undergone similar transformations. The Motor Factory produced 270 types of products last year and has increased to 484 types this year. Among the new products manufactured this year according to Soviet specifications are equipment such as experimental transformers with voltages as high as 250,000 volts. The Huatong Switch Factory has also produced various electrical control equipment for the automated machinery used by the Anshan Iron and Steel Company and the Soviet-style machine tools produced by machine tool factories in Shanghai, Jinan, and other places.

The new products manufactured according to Soviet specifications have superior performance, longer lifespan, and lower costs, far exceeding the products originally manufactured by the factories according to the specifications of capitalist countries. For example, after the Shanghai Wire Factory adopted Soviet sector-shaped conductors for power cables, lead consumption was reduced by half, and oil and paper consumption were reduced by 50% and 40% respectively. The use of Soviet sulfur-free rubber for braid wires completely eliminated the tin-plating process required for British and American specification braid wires, saving all tin usage. After the Shanghai Wire Factory manufactured four major types of products, including paper-insulated power cables, telephone cables, rubber wires and cables, and mining cables, according to Soviet specifications, it is estimated that the raw materials saved from May of last year to the end of this year, including rubber, tin, steel strips, lead, cotton yarn, insulating oil, and hemp thread, are worth approximately 90 billion yuan. This amount of money could be used to produce over 48,000 kilometers of ordinary rubber wires.

The state-owned Xiangtan Motor Factory has successfully trial-produced and produced 118 new products from August of last year to October of this year, supplying a large number of urgently needed products to many metallurgical, mining, textile, and power enterprises across the country. These new products were all designed and manufactured according to Soviet design drawings or Soviet product samples, combined with China's specific conditions. Seven of these new products participated in the international expositions in Leipzig and Damascus this year, and another eight new products will be sent abroad for exhibition next year. The new automatic air-break switches manufactured by this factory this year to support the construction of the second thin plate plant of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company were delivered on schedule, and the Anshan Iron and Steel Company sent a telegram to express its gratitude.

The new products made by the Xiangtan Motor Factory are not only better in performance and safer than the products previously manufactured according to British and American specifications, but also have simpler structures and use fewer materials. For example, the total number of single-piece varieties of protected and enclosed motors is more than half less for the new styles than for the old styles. In addition, a certain new type of oil circuit breaker, compared with similar old products, is not only safer and more durable, but also saves 70% on copper material alone.

    上海三家电器工厂和湘潭电机厂
    按照苏联规格制成优良新产品
    上海市三家最大的电器工厂——上海电机厂、上海电线厂、华通开关厂的主要产品，都已按照苏联规格制造。据不完全的统计，这三家工厂今年约有五百多种电气开关，五十多种类型的电线、电缆和几百种发电机、电动机、变压器，是根据苏联图纸、实物或参考苏联技术资料设计制造的。
    这三家工厂根据苏联规格制造产品，使技术水平有了显著提高。解放前只能生产几种民用皮线、花线的上海电线厂，去年试制了四十种苏联规格的新产品，今年又继续试制近三十种。为鞍山钢铁公司建设工程而试制的电压一万伏特的纸绝缘电力电缆，现已大批生产。这个工厂还为北京等大城市制造了可供二千四百人同时通话的电话电缆，又为电器工业、船舶工业和正在建设中的航空、汽车工业试制了一万瓩发电机用的梯形铜排、船用非燃性橡套电缆和飞机、汽车引擎发火线等。原来产品规格混杂、品种不全的上海电机厂和华通开关厂也起了同样的变化。电机厂去年生产二百七十种产品，今年已增加到四百八十四种。今年苏联规格的新产品中，有电压高达二十五万伏特的试验变压器等设备。华通开关厂也为鞍山钢铁公司使用的各种自动化机器和上海、济南等地机床厂生产的苏式机床，配制了各种电气控制设备。
    按照苏联规格制造的新产品，性能高、寿命长、成本低，远比各厂原来按资本主义国家规格制造的产品优越。如上海电线厂电力电缆采用苏联扇形导线后，铅节省一半，油、纸各节省百分之五十和百分之四十。采用苏联无硫橡皮的皮线，完全省掉了英美规格的皮线镀锡的工序，省出了全部用锡。上海电线厂的纸绝缘电力电缆、电话电缆、橡皮电线电缆和矿用电缆等四类主要产品按照苏联规格制造后，以去年五月到今年年底的产量计算，节省下来的橡胶、锡、钢带、铅、棉纱、绝缘油、麻线等原料估计约值九百亿元。这笔钱可以增产四万八千多公里长的普通橡皮电线。（新华社）
    国营湘潭电机厂从去年八月到今年十月已试制成功和生产了一百一十八种新产品，大量供应了全国许多冶金、采矿、纺织、电力等企业的迫切需要。这些新产品都是按照苏联设计图纸或者按照苏联产品图样结合我国具体条件设计制成的。其中有七种新产品今年参加了来比锡和大马士革的国际博览会，还有八种新产品将在明年送到国外展览。这个工厂今年为支援鞍山钢铁公司第二薄板厂建设而制造的新式自动空断开关按期送到后，鞍山钢铁公司曾来电表示感谢。
    湘潭电机厂制成的这些新产品比过去按照英美规格制造的产品，不仅性能好、安全，而且结构简单，材料用得少。如防护式和封闭式两类电动机的单件品种总数，新式的比旧式的要少一半以上。又如某种新式油断路器和同类旧产品比较，不但要安全耐用，而且仅铜料一项就要节省百分之七十。
