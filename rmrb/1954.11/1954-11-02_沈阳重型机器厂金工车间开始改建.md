    Renovation Begins at the Metalworking Shop of Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant
    Construction has begun on the medium-sized metalworking shop, a project included in the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant's renovation plan for this year. Engineers, technicians, and construction workers are working diligently and enthusiastically. Workers in the second fitter group used their rest time to collect various old and discarded parts from scrap piles and made one mixer and one stone washing machine, saving the country funds and increasing construction efficiency fourfold. Engineers, technicians, and workers also jointly researched and used the "one-time grouting method," improving work efficiency by more than 30%. Many workers have offered numerous rationalization proposals during construction. The entire project will be basically completed in the second quarter of 1955.
    After the renovation, the machine equipment in the metalworking shop will be the most modern, capable of manufacturing various types of crushers (such as jaw crushers, rotary crushers, etc.) under 30 tons. These machines can crush huge stones into small stones for use in laying railways, building bridge piers, repairing roads and highways, and also for basic construction foundation work. Various minerals extracted from mines can be crushed into small pieces by crushers and then ground into powder by ball mills for smelting various metals needed by industry.

    沈阳重型机器厂金工车间开始改建
    沈阳重型机器厂今年改建工程计划中的中型金工车间已开始施工。工程技术人员和基本建设工人正以兴奋的心情积极劳动着。钳工二组工人利用休息时间，在废铁堆里捡出许多种旧废零件，做出搅拌机和洗石机各一台，不但节省了国家资金，还使施工效率提高四倍。工程技术人员和工人又共同研究使用“一次灌浆法”，提高工作效率百分之三十以上。许多工人在施工中提出不少合理化建议。整个工程将在一九五五年第二季度基本完成。
    改建后金工车间的机器设备都是最新式的，能制造三十吨以下各式各样的破碎机（如颚式破碎机、旋转式破碎机等）。用这些机器可把巨大的石块破碎成小石头，用于铺铁路、建桥墩、修马路和公路，还可以供基本建设打基础的需要。从矿井里开采出的各种矿产，用破碎机破成小块，再经球磨机磨成粉状，可以冶炼出工业所需要的各种金属。
