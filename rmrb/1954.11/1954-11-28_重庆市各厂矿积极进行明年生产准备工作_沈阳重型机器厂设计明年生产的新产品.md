    Chongqing Municipality's factories and mines are actively preparing for production in 1955. Chongqing's steel plants have successively sent personnel to negotiate steel orders with users and have ordered large quantities of iron ore and other raw materials. The power plants have ordered large quantities of raw coal in preparation for the production needs of the first quarter of next year. Many factories and mines will trial-produce and produce new products next year. The Chongqing Air Compressor Factory will manufacture a batch of sugar-making machinery and equipment for a new sugar factory in Sichuan Province. The science and technology personnel of this factory are launching a labor emulation campaign for the design of the sugar-making machine. The jointly-owned 104th Steel Plant will formally produce a new product - double-ribbed tie plates - in the first quarter of next year and is now working on the machine modification of tie plate punching and shearing machines, and will train a group of workers who can master the production technology of double-ribbed tie plates. The Sichuan Cement Plant is installing an air separator, which is crucial to increasing cement production next year.
    Many factories and mines have also made specific arrangements for production, maintenance, labor allocation, and technical organizational measures for the first quarter and the first half of next year.

    A large number of design personnel at the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant are working intensely on designing new products for 1955.
    This plant will produce fifty new products next year. These include a large short cylinder ball mill and open hearth furnace tilting machine for the Anshan Iron and Steel Company, as well as a 2,000-ton oil press for the Shenyang Transformer Factory and a zinc plate rolling mill for the Guangdong Zinc Plate Factory. In the past, the design work for new products in this factory was mainly surveying and reviewing, and very few new products were designed entirely by themselves. Nearly half of the new products to be produced next year will be designed by themselves. If done according to the original design strength, it would take too long to complete. Now this factory has extracted as many technical personnel from the offices and workshops who can undertake design work as possible to work in the design department, and some university graduates who came to the factory this year have also been assigned to do design work. After the technical personnel of each office and workshop are extracted, their work has been undertaken by some excellent veteran workers who have been newly promoted.

### 重庆市各厂矿积极进行明年生产准备工作  沈阳重型机器厂设计明年生产的新产品

    重庆市各厂矿积极进行明年生产准备工作
    沈阳重型机器厂设计明年生产的新产品
    一九五五年生产的准备工作已在重庆市各厂矿中积极进行。重庆各钢铁厂已先后派人出去和用户接洽钢材订货，并订购大批铁矿砂和其他原材料。各电力厂已订购了大批原煤，准备明年第一季度生产需要。明年许多厂矿都要试制和生产新产品。重庆空气压缩机厂要为四川省一个新建的糖厂制造一批制糖机械设备，这个厂的科室人员正为制糖机的设计而展开劳动竞赛。公私合营一零四钢铁厂明年第一季度将正式生产一种新产品——双筋垫板，现正着手进行垫板冲剪机等机器改装工作，并将训练一批能掌握双筋垫板生产技术的工人。四川水泥厂正在安装一部对明年提高水泥产量有决定意义的选粉机。
    许多厂矿对明年第一季度和上半年的生产、检修、劳动力配备、技术组织措施等工作，也做了具体的安排。　（新华社）
    沈阳重型机器厂大批设计人员正在紧张设计一九五五年的新产品。
    这个厂明年要生产五十种新产品。其中有供给鞍山钢铁公司用的大型短筒球磨机和平炉倾倒机，还有给沈阳变压器厂生产的两千吨油压机和给广东锌板厂生产的锌板压延机等。过去这个厂生产新产品的设计工作主要是测绘和审查，完全靠自己设计的新产品很少。明年这个厂要生产的新产品，几乎有将近一半要由自己设计。如果按照原有设计力量来做，需要拖到很晚才能完成。现在这个厂已把凡是能够担负起设计工作的科室和车间里的技术人员都尽量抽调到设计部门来工作，今年来厂的一部分大学毕业生也被分配去做设计工作。各科室、车间的技术人员被抽出后，他们的工作已由新提拔的一些优秀老工人来担当。　（新华社）
