Xinhua News Agency, 28th: The United States is intensifying negotiations with the Chiang Kai-shek clique to sign a so-called "mutual defense treaty." The United States is attempting to use this treaty to legitimize its long-term occupation of Chinese territory, including Taiwan and other islands, and is scheming to further interfere with the Chinese people's liberation of coastal islands.

According to an Associated Press dispatch from Washington, the United States and the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek group have "largely" reached an agreement on the terms of a "defense treaty" and are preparing to sign it before the end of this year. According to the agreed-upon key points of the treaty, the United States will agree to regard an "armed attack" on the Taiwan area as "endangering its own (the United States') peace and security." The area under American "protection" includes not only Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, but also "other Kuomintang-controlled territories deemed essential by the United States for the defense of Taiwan." This treaty, which blatantly violates China's territorial integrity, "will be effective indefinitely."

According to an article by the Alsop brothers published in the "Washington Post" on November 19, as early as the beginning of the Eisenhower administration last year, the United States "openly supplied weapons" to Jinmen Island and Dachen Island, "and began to seriously establish the defense of these islands. Local Americans encouraged the establishment of this defense and even participated in the work."

    美国加紧和蒋贼谈判缔结军事侵略条约
    【新华社二十八日讯】美国正在加紧同蒋介石集团谈判签订所谓“共同防务条约”。美国企图利用这种条约使它长期侵占中国领土台湾等岛屿的活动合法化，并且阴谋进一步干预中国人民解放沿海岛屿。
    据美联社华盛顿消息透露，美国和蒋介石卖国集团“大体上”已就一个“防务条约”的条款达成协议，准备在今年年底以前签订。根据已经协议的条约要点，美国将同意把对台湾地区的“武装进攻”视为“危及它自己（美国）的和平和安全”。受美国“保护”的地区不仅包括台湾和澎湖列岛，并且还有“经美国断定为台湾的防御所不可缺少的其他国民党控制的领土”。这个露骨侵犯中国领土完整的条约，“将无限期有效”。
    据“华盛顿邮报”十一月十九日刊载的艾尔索普兄弟的文章透露，早在去年艾森豪威尔政府上台之初，美国对金门岛和大陈岛，“就公开供应武器了，而且就开始认真建立这些岛屿的防务的工作了。当地的美国人鼓励这种防务的建立，甚至还参加这项工作。”
