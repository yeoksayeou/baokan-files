    After the peak season this year, the sales of industrial products and the procurement of agricultural products mostly failed to meet the planned targets. The poor sales of industrial products further increased the difficulties in agricultural product procurement. Regarding the sales of industrial products, some commodities have large stocks at the wholesale level and are even backlogged; however, there are shortages at the retail level in rural areas. One of the reasons for this situation is the lack of close integration between state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce; unreasonable situations in the commodity circulation process are also an important reason. At the same time, some employees still have the mistaken idea that "the fewer commodities supplied according to the plan, the better" and "it doesn't matter if the plan is not completed." Obviously, this situation is incompatible with the Party and the state's policy of gradually meeting the people's living needs within the scope of existing production and to the extent possible, and must be quickly overcome.
    State-owned commerce and cooperative commerce both belong to socialist commerce, and their basic tasks are to serve the development of industrial and agricultural production and to meet the needs of the people. State-owned commerce is the leading force in the market, and cooperative commerce is a close assistant to state-owned commerce and a bridge for organizing small producers to closely integrate with the state-owned economy. State-owned commerce and cooperative commerce must, under the unified leadership of Party committees, governments, and commercial administrative departments at all levels, closely integrate, help and encourage each other, and strive to complete the current plan for the sales of industrial products and the procurement of agricultural products.
  　The commodity allocation work of state-owned commerce has improved recently, and most commodities have been transported to grassroots wholesale units. In addition to continuing to strengthen commodity allocation work, the most urgent task now is to quickly take effective measures to distribute these industrial products that have been transported to grassroots wholesale units to rural retail enterprises to meet consumers and meet the needs of farmers for industrial products after selling agricultural products as much as possible. Therefore, on the one hand, we must vigorously exert the role of cooperative retail institutions, and on the other hand, we should also make full use of rural retail merchants to expand retail business.
    All staff members of state-owned commerce must establish the idea of closely relying on and helping cooperatives. In all counties where the provincial authorities have decided that state-owned commercial wholesale organizations should be established in the decision on urban and rural division of labor, and state-owned commercial wholesale organizations have been established, all effective measures must be taken, such as organizing supply conferences at the county level, touring exhibitions, and commodity displays, to ensure that all inventory commodities meet with the grassroots cooperatives, and earnestly help grassroots cooperatives select commodities suitable for the needs of the people to supply to farmers, and resolutely prevent and overcome the bureaucratic style of "waiting for customers to come to the door" and "goods in the warehouse, no goods in the store" and the practice of forcing the combination of commodities, regardless of whether they meet the needs of the people, hindering the rational operation of cooperatives. In all counties where cooperatives are responsible for wholesale, state-owned commerce should, according to the laws of commodity circulation, actively promote county cooperatives to purchase goods directly from state-owned second-level wholesale stations or branch companies, and provide transfer and wholesale conditions in terms of procedures according to the newly stipulated regulations and methods, so that county cooperatives can undertake transfer and wholesale business, and resolutely prevent and overcome the phenomenon of only considering the convenience and "interests" of their own units and not actively assisting cooperatives to carry out transfer and wholesale business, thereby hindering commodity circulation.
    All staff members of cooperative commerce must establish the idea of closely integrating with state-owned commerce, and under the leadership of state-owned commerce, actively completing the industrial product sales and agricultural product procurement tasks stipulated by the state. All county cooperatives and grassroots cooperatives should give full play to their existing financial capacity, actively purchase goods from state-owned commerce, and ensure the completion and exceeding of the predetermined sales plan and procurement tasks. All county cooperatives should actively lead and organize grassroots cooperatives to closely integrate with state-owned commerce. When funds are insufficient, loans can be obtained from nearby banks according to the actual needs of commodity circulation. It is necessary to resolutely prevent and overcome the mistaken idea of "doing as much business as there is money" without actively expanding commodity circulation to meet the needs of consumers, as well as the passive attitude of some county cooperatives who do not actively lead and organize grassroots cooperatives to purchase goods from state-owned commerce because state-owned commerce directly wholesales to grassroots cooperatives.
    After the division of labor between state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce in terms of urban and rural business scope, state-owned commerce has become the main channel for wholesale business, which is a necessary condition for strengthening the leadership of state-owned commerce over the market and strengthening the balance of supply, production, and sales of major commodities. However, under the principle of unified planning and leadership of the market by state-owned commerce, cooperative commerce must also maintain and continue to strengthen its wholesale business, rather than stop its wholesale business, which is a necessary condition for state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce to jointly activate urban and rural exchanges, organize diverse non-planned commodities to meet the needs of the people as much as possible, complete agricultural product procurement tasks, and transform private merchants. It is wrong to fail to recognize that state-owned commerce is the main channel for wholesale business and to emphasize the establishment of two parallel wholesale systems regardless of commodity variety, which is not conducive to strengthening the unified leadership of state-owned commerce over the market and strengthening the state's planning in the supply and sales of major commodities; it is also wrong to fail to recognize the necessity of cooperative commerce to establish and strengthen wholesale business, thereby weakening the wholesale business of cooperatives regardless of commodity and region, which is not conducive to activating urban and rural material exchanges and organizing diverse non-planned commodities to meet the needs of the people. After the division of labor between state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce in terms of business scope, the wholesale business of cooperative commerce still has a broad scope. Party committees and governments and commercial administrative departments at all levels should help and organize cooperatives to actively carry out wholesale business for the products of urban and rural individual handicraftsmen and production cooperatives under the principle of unified planning and leadership of the market by state-owned commerce; for certain industrial products that are not operated or insufficiently supplied by state-owned companies, cooperatives at all levels should also actively carry out procurement and sales. Cooperatives should strengthen local product promotion institutions, and in addition to first completing the state-entrusted procurement tasks of non-staple foods and local products, they should also actively operate small local products that are not operated or insufficiently operated by state-owned commerce. After first meeting the needs of the state, the surplus can be wholesaled to the market, and retail stores with sample rooms can be set up. Only in this way can both state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce give full play to their organizational strength, expand commodity circulation, and overcome some of the current obstacles in urban and rural exchanges, so as to better develop urban and rural material exchanges, serve industrial and agricultural production, and serve the needs of the people.
    At present, in the rural retail market, it is also necessary to vigorously strengthen the transformation of private merchants and strengthen the arrangement and leadership of the market. The common responsibility of state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce must be to not only complete the task of promoting industrial products and procuring agricultural products, but also to implement the general policy of stepping up the arrangement of the market and the transformation of private merchants. In addition to completing its own retail plan, cooperative commerce must also fully and correctly utilize and give play to the enthusiasm of existing rural merchants, and give them an appropriate amount of commodities through methods such as distribution and consignment sales. Commercial administrative departments and state-owned specialized companies must, under the unified leadership of the local Party committees and governments, earnestly assist and guide county cooperatives to make appropriate arrangements for rural private merchants according to policies, carry out wholesale business to rural private merchants, and carry out socialist transformation of rural private merchants step by step and by industry through wholesale business. Therefore, in the retail price of cooperatives, it is necessary to distinguish commodities and gradually achieve complete consistency with state-owned commerce, and overcome the unreasonable phenomenon that the price of many commodities and in many areas is higher in cities than in rural areas. State-owned commerce and cooperative commerce should organize material exchange meetings of primary markets jointly hosted by state-owned commerce and cooperatives, and attended by vendors from rural areas and small towns, focusing on the promotion of industrial products, handicraft products and small local products, actively organize the supply of these commodities, and open up their sales channels. Places that are already holding exchange meetings should strengthen leadership, ensure that they are well-held, and summarize experience to promote them quickly. When necessary, the province or prefecture should also hold various types of material exchange meetings.
    Further strengthening the integration of state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce is an important condition for completing the current task of promoting industrial products and procuring agricultural products. Party committees at all levels should, when deploying the work of unified purchase and sales, conduct inspections on the integration of state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce, and effectively solve various ideological and organizational obstacles of state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce, so as to complete the commodity purchase and sales tasks stipulated by the state.

    进一步加强国营商业和合作社商业的结合
    今年旺季到来后，工业品销售和农产品收购大部未能完成计划。工业品销售情况不好，进一步增加了农产品收购工作的困难。在工业品销售方面，若干商品在批发环节上存量很大，且有积压；但农村零售环节却存在着脱销现象。造成这种情况的原因之一，是由于国营商业和合作社商业结合不密切；在商品流转环节中存在着不合理的情况，也是一个重要原因。同时，有些职工也还存在着“计划供应的商品越少卖越好”“不完成计划不要紧”的错误思想。显然的，这种情况是同党和国家在现有生产条件下、在可能范围内有步骤地满足人民生活需要的方针不相容的，必须迅速克服。
    国营商业和合作社商业，同属于社会主义性质的商业，它们的基本任务就是为发展工农业生产服务，为满足人民的需要服务。国营商业是市场的领导力量，合作社商业是国营商业亲密的助手和组织广大小生产者跟国营经济紧密结合的桥梁。国营商业和合作社商业必须在各级党政和商业行政部门的统一领导下，密切结合，互助互励，努力完成当前工业品销售和农产品收购的计划。
  　国营商业的商品调运工作，近来已有好转，大部分商品，已经运到了基层批发单位。目前除了应该继续加强商品调运工作以外，最迫切的任务，就是要迅速采取有效措施，把这些已经运到基层批发单位的工业品分配到农村零售企业中去，同消费者见面，尽可能满足农民在出售农产品后对工业品的需要。因此，一方面必须大力发挥合作社零售机构的作用，同时还应该充分利用农村零售商贩，扩展零售业务。
    国营商业一切工作人员，必须树立紧密依靠和帮助合作社的思想。凡是各省在城乡分工决定中已规定由国营商业设置批发机构的县，国营商业已经设立起批发机构的，必须采取一切有效的办法，如组织以县为单位的供应会议，巡回展览，商品陈列等，做到所有的库存商品和基层合作社见面，切实帮助基层合作社挑选适合人民需要的商品供应农民，坚决防止和克服“等客上门”、“仓库有货、门市无货”的官僚主义作风和不问是否合乎人民需要，强迫搭配商品，妨碍合作社合理经营的办法。凡是规定由合作社负责进行批发的县，国营商业应根据商品流转规律积极推动县合作社向国营二级批发站或分公司直接进货，按新规定的条例办法，在手续上给以转批条件，使县合作社有可能来担负转批的业务，坚决防止和克服只顾本单位经营的便利和“利益”，因而不去积极协助合作社开展转批业务，以致妨碍商品流转的现象。
    合作社商业的一切工作人员，必须树立和国营商业密切结合，在国营商业领导下，积极完成国家规定的工业品销售和农产品收购任务的思想。一切县社和基层合作社，都应当充分发挥现有的资金能力，积极向国营商业进货，保证完成并超过预定的销售计划和收购任务。一切县合作社，应当积极领导和组织基层合作社和国营商业紧密结合。资金不足时，根据商品流转的实际需要，可向就近银行贷款。要坚决防止和克服“有多少资金，做多大生意”而不去积极扩展商品流转满足消费者需要的错误思想，以及某些县合作社由于国营商业直接向基层社批发因而不去积极领导和组织基层社向国营商业进货的消极态度。
    国营商业和合作社商业就城乡经营范围分工后，国营商业成为批发业务的主要渠道，这是加强国营商业对市场的领导和加强主要商品的供产销平衡的必要条件。但在国营商业统一计划和领导市场的原则下，合作社商业也必须保持和继续加强其批发业务，而不是停止其批发业务，这是国营商业和合作社商业共同活跃城乡交流、组织多种多样的非计划商品以尽可能满足人民需要、完成农产品收购任务和改造私商的一个必要条件。不认识国营商业是批发业务的主要孔道，强调建立不分商品品种的两个平行的批发系统的做法是不对的，是不利于加强国营商业对市场的统一领导和加强国家在主要商品供销上的计划性的；不认识合作社商业建立和加强批发业务的必要性，因而不分商品、不分地区，削弱合作社的批发业务的做法也是不对的，是不利于活跃城乡物资交流并组织多种多样的非计划商品来满足人民需要的。在国营商业和合作社商业就经营范围作了城乡分工之后，合作社商业的批发业务仍然有广阔的范围，各级党政和商业行政部门应当帮助和组织合作社在国营商业统一计划和领导市场的原则下，积极开展对城乡个体手工业者和生产合作社的产品进行收购和推销的批发业务；对国营公司未经营或供应不足的某些工业品，各级合作社也应积极进行采购和推销。合作社应加强土产推销机构，除首先完成国家委托收购的副食品和土产收购任务外，并应积极经营国营商业不经营或经营不过来的小土产，在首先满足国家的需要之外，有余者可对市场批发，并可设立样子间的零售门市部。只有这样，才能使国营商业和合作社商业均能充分发挥其组织力量，扩大商品流转，克服目前城乡交流中存在的一些阻滞现象，以便更好地发展城乡物资交流，为工农业生产服务，为满足人民需要服务。
    目前在农村零售市场上，还必须用大力加强对私商的改造，加强市场的安排和领导。国营商业和合作社商业的共同责任，必须是一方面既要完成工业品推销和农产品收购的任务，另一方面又必须贯彻总的踏步着重对市场的安排和对私商改造的方针。合作社商业除完成自己的零售计划外，还必须充分而正确地利用和发挥现有农村商贩的积极性，通过经销、代销等办法给他们以适当数量的商品。商业行政部门和各国营专业公司必须在当地党政统一领导下，认真协助和指导县合作社，根据政策，对农村私商进行适当的安排，开展对农村私商的批发业务，并通过批发业务，有步骤地、分行分业地对农村私商进行社会主义改造。因此在合作社零售价格上，必须分别商品，有步骤地做到同国营商业完全一致，克服目前不少商品和不少地区城市价格高于乡村价格的不合理现象。国营商业和合作社商业应该组织由国营商业和合作社共同主持的，吸收乡村和小城镇商贩参加的，以推销工业品、手工业品和小土产为主的初级市场的物资交流会，积极组织这些商品的货源，并开拓其销路。现在已在召开交流会的地方应加强领导，保证开好，并总结经验，迅速推行。有必要时，省或专区亦应召开各种类型的物资交流会。
    进一步加强国营商业和合作社商业的结合，是完成目前工业品推销和农产品收购任务的一个重要条件，各级党委应当在布置统购统销工作时，对国营商业和合作社商业的结合情况，进行检查，切实地解决国营商业和合作社商业在思想上、组织上的各种障碍，以完成国家规定的商品购销任务。
