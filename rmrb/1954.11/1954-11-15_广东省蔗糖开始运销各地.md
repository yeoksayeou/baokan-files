    Guangdong Province Begins Transporting and Selling Sugar to Various Regions
    On the 10th, the Guangdong Provincial Sugar Company of the China National Sundries Company transported the first 150 tons of brown sugar produced by Guangdong state-owned sugar factories to Bengbu, Anhui this year. From the 12th to the 15th, more than 1,600 tons of white sugar and brown sugar will continue to be shipped to Wuhan, Tianjin, Inner Mongolia and the Northwest regions. The Guangdong Provincial Sugar Company of the China National Sundries Company's sugar procurement plan for 1954 to 1955 is about 40 percent higher than the previous year, and it is now preparing to appropriately expand the supply plan for the fourth quarter of this year based on the increased production of state-owned sugar factories.
