Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 9th: According to TASS, the governments of the Soviet Union and the Hungarian People's Republic issued a joint communiqué regarding the transfer of Soviet shares in various Soviet-Hungarian joint stock companies to the Hungarian People's Republic.

    The communiqué points out that, according to the economic cooperation agreement concluded between the Soviet Union and Hungary in 1945, Soviet-Hungarian joint stock companies for bauxite-aluminum, petroleum industry, and transportation were established in Hungary to promote the restoration and development of the Hungarian economy, which had suffered enormous losses due to the German fascist occupation. Since the establishment of these companies, both parties have invested a large amount of capital in these companies' enterprises. The Soviet side supplied a large amount of new equipment and materials and provided technical assistance. As a result of the expansion and reconstruction of old enterprises and the construction of new enterprises, the improvement of production organization, and the adoption of advanced labor methods, the production volume of the enterprises under these companies has greatly increased. The achievements of the companies have played an important role in the restoration and development of the Hungarian national economy and have prepared the ground for transferring the management of the enterprises to Hungarian state organs.

    In view of the fact that the above-mentioned companies have completed their tasks, the two governments unanimously agreed to transfer the Soviet shares in these companies to the Hungarian People's Republic. On November 6th, the two governments signed an agreement in Moscow stipulating the sale and transfer of Soviet shares in various Soviet-Hungarian joint stock companies to the Hungarian People's Republic, as well as the sale of the Soviet Industrial and Commercial Bank established in Hungary. The agreement stipulates that the value of the Soviet shares in the above-mentioned companies and the value of the Industrial and Commercial Bank will be repaid by the Hungarian side under preferential terms over several years.

    The communiqué stated: The agreement on transferring the Soviet shares in these companies to Hungary demonstrates the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Hungary and will further promote the friendship and cooperation between the two countries.
