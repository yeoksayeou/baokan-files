Great Achievements of Collective Labor
Soviet East Kazakhstan Oblast, Pretegolninsky District
“Stalin” Collective Farm Chairman En Niake

This autumn has brought many joyous events to the members of our collective farm. Through their creative labor and selfless struggle, they have achieved great successes in developing the public economy. The collective farm is firmly on the path to further economic upswing, and the rewards for workdays are becoming even more abundant. Many collective farm members' families have already received two to four hundred poods of grain in advance, nearly sixty kilograms of honey, and a lot of feed for their own livestock. By the end of the year, the collective farm will pay seven rubles per workday, and also give each family thirty to seventy kilograms of sunflower seeds. Our members have never received such high workday compensation before.

One guarantee of our work achievements is the correct utilization of the collective farm's production potential. The original plan was to reclaim nine hundred hectares of wasteland, but we have now reclaimed two thousand three hundred and forty hectares. As a result, the sown area has been greatly expanded, and more wheat and feed grains have been sown. Because we cultivated and sowed nine hundred and sixty-three hectares of wasteland in the spring, the collective farm was able to harvest an additional twenty-one thousand five hundred centners of grain. We planted maize for the first time: one hundred and eighty hectares for food and two hundred hectares for animal feed.

The struggle to increase field yields has been conducted better and more organized. The collective farm's sowing work was carried out quickly and completed during the best sowing period. We sowed selected seeds, adopted close planting and cross-sowing methods, and applied mineral fertilizers. In addition, timely field management work was carried out.

All of this ensured that we obtained high yields. An average of sixteen centners of grain was harvested per hectare. The first field work team led by Communist Party member Pavel Tokomin harvested eighteen centners of grain per hectare on two thousand six hundred hectares of land, and harvested thirty-one centners of wheat per hectare on one hundred and eighty-eight hectares of wasteland sown in the spring. The work team led by agronomist Youth League member Yekaterina Glokhtova and the work team of Communist Party member Dmitry Lyapunov also achieved high production targets.

The members actively participated in the harvesting work. Under the advocacy of the Communist Party members, socialist competition was widely launched in the work teams and combine harvester groups. As a result, despite having two thousand hectares of high-yielding crops, the harvesting work was carried out quickly and in an organized manner. The high discipline of all members, the voluntary assistance of workers from the Ertis factory, and the excellent work of the tractor work teams of the Pretegolninsky machine tractor station contributed to our achievements. The members manually harvested three hundred hectares of "lodged" wheat (a type of wheat – translator's note) in a short period. Long before the start of the harvest, the collective farm, with the voluntary assistance of the workers, built four threshing grounds with sheds and installed self-designed winnowing machines with high productivity. Because of these threshing grounds and machines, we were able to deliver grain to the state without interruption.

The collective farm originally expected to harvest seventy-two thousand centners of grain this year. But in reality, eighty-five thousand centners were harvested. The collective farm stored seeds, reserve grain, and feed, and supplied the state with fifty-five thousand centners of grain. Initially, we planned to sell eight thousand centners of grain to the state, but later the members recalculated and decided to sell twenty-six thousand centners of grain to the state. Therefore, this year, our collective farm alone supplied the state with the equivalent of the total grain supplied by the entire district last year.

The collective farm has widely launched construction work. The focus of this work is on the construction of main buildings. For example, a stone warehouse capable of holding seventeen thousand centners of grain was built. Now we are building a fully mechanized dairy barn made of brick, capable of housing four hundred dairy cows, and two stables. In the future, we also plan to build many livestock pens, mechanized threshing grounds, repair shops, clubs, greenhouses, vegetable cellars with salting rooms, and housing for the members, all made of stone and brick.

A solid foundation has now been laid for future harvests. The plowing work is in full swing, winter crops—winter rye and winter wheat—have been sown in a short period, and the work of sowing sunflowers before winter is about to be completed. Next year, the total harvest of our collective farm will reach one hundred and four thousand centners of grain and nearly ten thousand five hundred centners of sunflowers.

Because we have achieved these successes in grain crops, we have a great opportunity to eliminate the backwardness of animal husbandry, drastically increase the productivity of livestock, and thereby increase the income of the farm. This year, our farm will not experience a shortage of feed. Hay, straw, silage, and grain feed are all stored in abundance.

This year's achievements have convinced the members that even greater achievements will be reached in the future.

    集体劳动的伟大成果
    苏联东哈萨克斯坦州普列特高尔宁斯基区
    “斯大林”集体农庄主席  恩·尼雅克
    今年的秋天给我们集体农庄庄员带来了很多喜事。他们以自己的创造性劳动和忘我的奋斗，在发展公有经济方面获得了巨大的成就。集体农庄稳固地踏上了经济进一步高涨的道路，劳动日的报酬也更加丰富了。许多集体农庄庄员的家庭预先就得到了二百至四百普特粮食，将近六十公斤蜂蜜以及很多用来喂自己的牲口的饲料。到年底，集体农庄将按每个劳动日七个卢布来支付报酬，同时还要给每个家庭三十至七十公斤的葵花子。我们的庄员从来没有得到过这么多的劳动日报酬。
    我们获得工作成绩的一项保证就是正确地利用集体农庄的生产潜力。原定计划要开垦九百公顷荒地，但现在已开垦了两千三百四十公顷。因此，播种面积比去年扩大了很多，小麦和饲料谷物也播种得多了。因为春天耕种和播种了九百六十三公顷荒地，所以集体农庄能够多收获两万一千五百公担谷物。我们第一次播种了玉蜀黍：一百八十公顷供做食粮的，二百公顷供做牲畜饲料用的。
    为提高田地收获量的斗争进行得更好，更有组织了。集体农庄的播种工作进行得很快，并且是在最好的播种时期完成的。我们播种了精选的种籽，采用了密植和交叉播种法，施了矿物肥料。此外并及时地进行了田间管理工作。
    这一切就保证了我们获得高额的收成。平均每公顷收割了十六公担谷物，共产党员帕维尔·托科明领导的第一田野工作队在两千六百公顷土地上每公顷收割了十八公担谷物，在春天播种的一百八十八公顷荒地上每公顷收割了三十一公担小麦。农学家青年团员叶卡捷林娜·格洛赫托娃领导的工作队以及共产党员季米特里·良普诺夫的工作队都达到了高度的生产指标。
    庄员们积极地参加了收割工作。在共产党员们的倡导下，在工作队和联合收割机组内都广泛地展开了社会主义竞赛。结果，尽管有两千公顷丰产的庄稼，可是收割工作进行得很快，很有组织。全体庄员的高度纪律性，额尔齐斯工厂的工人对我们的义务帮助，普列特高尔宁斯基机器拖拉机站的拖拉机工作队的优良工作，这些就促使我们获得了以上的成绩。庄员们在短期间用手工收割了三百公顷的“倒伏”小麦（一种小麦的品种——译注）。开始收割前很久，集体农庄借工人的义务帮助修了四个带棚的打谷场，并安装了具有高度生产率的、自己设计的簸谷机，因为有了这些打谷场和机器，我们就能够不中断地把谷物运给国家。
    集体农庄原来预计今年收割七万二千公担谷物。但是实际上收割了八万五千公担，集体农庄贮藏起了种籽、后备粮和饲料，并供给国家五万五千公担谷物。起初我们预计售给国家八千公担粮食，但是后来庄员们又计算了一下，决定卖给国家两万六千公担粮食。因此，今年仅我们这一个集体农庄就供给了国家相当于去年全区所供给的粮食。
    集体农庄广泛地展开了建筑工作。这项工作的重点是修建主要的建筑物。例如，修盖了一个能容一万七千公担粮食的石砌仓库。现在我们正用砖盖一个完全机械化的能容四百头乳牛的乳牛栏和两个马厩。将来计划还要用石头和砖修建许多牲畜栏、机械化打谷场、修理所、俱乐部、温室、带盐渍室的菜窖以及庄员们的住房。
    现在已为将来的收成打下了巩固的基础，翻地工作正在热烈地进行着，在短期间播种了冬季作物——冬裸麦和冬小麦，冬天以前播种向日葵的工作也即将完成。明年，我们集体农庄的总收获量将达十万零四千公担谷物和将近一万零五百公担向日葵。
    因为我们在谷物作物方面获得了这些成绩，所以便有了巨大的可能来消灭畜牧业的落后现象，急剧提高牲畜的产品生产率，并以此来增进农庄的收入，今年我们农庄就不会发生饲料不足的现象了。干草、稻草、青储饲料、谷物饲料都贮备得很丰富。
    今年，集体农庄所获得的成绩使庄员们确信，将来一定会达到更大的成果。
