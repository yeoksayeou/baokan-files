Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm, 22nd - According to TASS, the World Peace Council held a meeting on the afternoon of November 20th, chaired by Liu Ningyi, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions.

Jose Flota Moreira, Secretary-General of the Brazilian Labor Party, read a joint report by the Brazilian delegation specifically addressing "the situation in South America caused by interference in national internal affairs."

The report stated that many treaties and agreements bind all Latin American countries to the North Atlantic Alliance, and these countries have also concluded bilateral agreements with the United States. All these treaties and agreements are contrary to the interests of Latin American countries. We are witnessing Latin American countries being transformed into participants in a military bloc pieced together with the United States at its center.

The report pointed out that one of the characteristics of the current situation in Latin American countries is the discrimination and restrictions these countries suffer in their diplomatic, economic, and cultural relations with the rest of the world. International aggressors openly and directly interfere in the internal affairs of Latin American countries. This interference, based on oppressing the people of Latin American countries, inevitably causes increasingly strong resistance from the people of Latin American countries and creates chaos and instability in the internal situation of these countries.

The report stated that it is no exaggeration to say that we are witnessing a real and tangible foreign aggression. The facts show that the real aggressors of Latin America are those militarist forces that issue orders and force others to accept policies that are harmful to national interests and peace.

The report concluded by describing the struggle for the relaxation of international tensions and for free trade and cultural exchange that has unfolded in Latin American countries. This struggle has gained considerable momentum and has produced preliminary results, especially in trade with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. At the same time, a struggle is underway to defend national sovereignty.

The meeting then discussed the Brazilian delegation's report.

The first speaker was Colombian writer Uribe. He said that the policy of expanding armaments and the "Cold War" has plunged Latin American countries into poverty, restricted civil liberties and democratic rights, caused instability in the national economy, and strengthened their economic dependence. Foreign capital, primarily from the United States, dominates these countries, plundering their natural resources. Uribe said: The people of Latin American countries want independence and peace. The peace movement advocates turning Latin America into a bastion of peace, with relations between countries based on the Five Principles announced by the People's Republic of China and India.

Mexican former Minister of the Navy, General Jara, then spoke. In his speech, Jara spoke about the imperialist policies adopted by Western countries towards the people of backward countries. Jara said that imperialist countries arm these countries against the will of their people and exploit their economic difficulties to deprive them of their freedom under the guise of so-called "aid." Jara said that after American capital infiltrated the Latin American market, it was unwilling to be a guest in these countries. It wants to be the master, the boss. In order to enslave other countries, it concocts a "communist threat."

Jara concluded by saying that only by acting in concert with the vanguard of the world's peace forces can the brothers of Latin America gain the right to a peaceful life and achieve happiness.

Next, Chairman Liu Ningyi announced that the conference had received a letter from Paul Robeson, the outstanding peace fighter who was unable to attend the meeting because the American authorities refused to issue him a passport. In his letter, Robeson described how the progressive forces in the United States are fighting for peace, and spoke of his recent travels in the country, during which he was once again convinced that millions of honest Americans want peace. Robeson also expressed his fervent hope for the success of the conference.

A short congratulatory message from Robeson and a recording of songs he sang to celebrate the World Peace Council meeting were also played at the meeting. After listening to the recording, all those present stood up and gave a thunderous applause. Shouts of "Long live peace!" rang out in the hall.

After speeches by writer Adalberto Ortiz (Ecuador) and Chilean Deputy Speaker of the Senate, Salvador Allende, the meeting adjourned.

Lombardo Toledano, President of the Latin American Labor Federation, spoke after the break. He pointed out that due to the policies implemented by the United States in Latin American countries, legitimate governments in many Latin American countries have been overthrown by violence, and violent regimes have been established. In these countries, many anti-democratic measures have been implemented. Many American political agents are active in Latin America. Lombardo Toledano went on to say that the people of Latin American countries understand that although their territories are vast and their populations are large, they are unable to play a decisive role in international life because they are deprived of the right to control their own destiny. Therefore, they always closely link the issue of war and peace with the issue of their national independence.

Toledano concluded by proposing that a meeting be convened in the first half of 1955 to discuss the Latin American issue in order to safeguard and expand the democratic freedoms of these countries, defend their national independence, and implement policies of friendship, trade, and cultural exchange with all countries.

Argentine writer Varela spoke about the struggle for peace in Argentina. He said: Recently, Argentina's trade exchanges with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries have expanded. Our commodities, which could not find a market in the past, can now be exported to these countries, and we can obtain the machinery and other commodities that our country needs from these countries. The Argentine government's decision to expand trade is due to the demands of people from all walks of life.

Professor Selim Ahmed of Baghdad University spoke on the second item on the agenda. He said that the establishment of a circle of military bases around the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, as well as dragging Iraq into this military system, poses a serious threat to the cause of peace. The ruling group in Iraq has established a reign of terror in the country, persecuting peace advocates. But the patriotic forces in Iraq are not afraid of repression and are intensifying their struggle. They demand the abolition of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty, the withdrawal of foreign troops, and the rejection of the so-called American "aid" imposed on Iraq.

Also speaking at the meeting were Alberto Roa Sustre, President of the Cuban Federation of Health Workers' Unions, and Danish pastor Hansen.

Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm, 23rd - According to TASS, the World Peace Council continued its meeting on the morning of November 21st.

After a speech by Israeli Member of Parliament Dubei, Georgi Nadzhekov, Vice President of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences and Chairman of the Executive Bureau of the Bulgarian National Committee for the Defense of Peace, spoke. He said: Peace advocates need to take new measures to mobilize all peace forces to break the plan to revive German militarism. He also called on the meeting to support the proposal of the Indian Association of Scientific Workers to immediately convene an international conference of scientific workers to seek ways to ban all weapons of mass destruction and prevent the use of science and scientists for the purpose of killing mankind.

The next speakers were Irish Christian pacifist Reverend Armstrong, who was participating in the World Peace Council for the first time, and Dr. Ben Slimane, the representative from Tunisia.

Turkish journalist Tuna said that the United States is turning Turkey into a military base. More than 60 percent of Turkey's national budget is allocated to military expenditures. The total amount of Turkey's foreign debt currently amounts to 180 million US dollars and is still increasing. Unemployment is increasing and the people's living standards are declining.

Spanish architect and former Republican Spanish Ambassador Acas, in his speech, exposed the US plan to use Spain to prepare for a new war. He said that the Spanish people oppose the war plan and oppose the division of Europe. They hope to realize the Soviet proposal to establish a European collective security system.

After Acas's speech, the meeting began to discuss the fifth item on the agenda: preparing to convene the World Peace Conference in the first half of 1955.

Indian representative Abbas gave a report on this item on the agenda. He analyzed the achievements made by the world peace movement in the past five years and pointed out that the threat of war has not been eliminated. Abbas said: One of the issues that should receive the most attention at the World Peace Conference to be held in 1955 is the issue of banning atomic weapons. Abbas suggested organizing a special scientific committee to prepare a report on the banning of atomic and chemical weapons and on the possibilities of using atomic energy for peaceful purposes. Abbas pointed out that other issues that should be discussed at the conference are: the US interference in Southeast Asia, the struggle against the colonial system, the conditions for peaceful coexistence among countries created by the Soviet government's statements, and the Five Principles on which Sino-Indian and Sino-Burmese relations are based. Abbas also suggested that the conference discuss the issue of expanding cultural ties between countries. He pointed out that large-scale cultural relations between India and the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries have developed.

P. Meunier (France) described the tasks of the upcoming conference in his speech. He said that the public in all countries of the world can and must prevent the intensification of international tensions. Public opinion is playing an increasingly important role in world affairs, which is mainly the result of the activities of the world peace movement.

Ho Cueto (Chile) spoke. He suggested that a special meeting be held before the World Peace Conference to consider the situation caused by the colonial policies implemented by imperialist countries in Latin American countries.

Preparing for next year's World Peace Conference was also the theme of Ivor Montagu's (UK) speech. He said that now is the time to convene a new conference to give our movement a new impetus. However, we do not want to do everything ourselves. We do not intend to draw any lines between our movement and other movements. We will appeal to all who want peace. Montagu also said that the preparations for the World People's Peace Conference should be carried out under the slogan of striving for world peace and opposing the final division of Europe. Our task is to explain the true meaning of the situation to the people. If the Paris Agreements are ratified, then Germany will be armed, Europe will be irretrievably divided, and the issue of cooperation between the people of all countries will become more complicated.

Next, Conference Chairman Faubek announced that the conference had received congratulatory messages from working people, scientists, public leaders, and politicians.

The meeting adjourned after the "Swedish Left-Wing Women's League" delegation delivered its congratulatory message.

Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm, 23rd - According to TASS, the World Peace Council meeting on the 22nd was conducted in committees and subcommittees.

Participants in the meeting are still arriving in Stockholm. Among those who arrived on November 21st was Otto Nuschke, Deputy Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic.

While this meeting is holding plenary sessions and various committees are working, it is also holding many meetings to promote the establishment and strengthening of ties between social celebrities. Such as the meeting of scientists from various countries attending the meeting and Swedish scientists, the meeting of all Asian national delegations, the meeting of all European national delegations, the meeting of writers from various countries attending the meeting and Swedish writers. The meeting of the delegations from Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Poland, Germany, and the Soviet Union with the participants of the "Peace Voyage."

Many cities in Sweden held peace supporters' conferences to celebrate the World Peace Council meeting. In Trelleborg, a conference hosted by the (Swedish) Soviet Association sent a congratulatory telegram to the Soviet delegation attending the meeting, saying: "Please convey our congratulations to the members of the presidium and all the delegates, as well as our desire for the relaxation of international tensions. Dialogue and mutual understanding between countries are the basis for peace throughout the world."

    世界和平理事会继续举行会议
    【新华社二十二日讯】据塔斯社斯德哥尔摩讯：世界和平理事会十一月二十日下午举行会议，由中华全国总工会副主席刘宁一担任主席。
    巴西劳工党总书记若泽·弗洛塔·摩雷拉宣读了巴西代表团专门谈“由于国家内政受到干涉而造成的南美洲局势”的联合报告。
    报告说，许多条约和协定把所有的拉丁美洲国家同北大西洋联盟束缚在一起，而且这些国家还同美国缔结了双边协定。所有这些条约和协定都是违背拉丁美洲各国的利益的。我们目击拉丁美洲国家正在被转变成为以美国为中心而拼凑起来的军事集团的参加者。
    报告指出，目前拉丁美洲各国情况的特征之一是这些国家在同世界其他国家的外交、经济和文化关系上所受的歧视和限制。国际侵略势力公开直接地干涉拉丁美洲各国的内政。这种以压迫拉丁美洲各国人民为基础的干涉，不可避免地引起拉丁美洲各国人民的越来越强烈的抵抗，并且造成了这些国家的内部形势的混乱和不稳定。
    报告说，要说我们正在目击着一种真正而有形的外国侵略，并不算夸张。事实说明拉丁美洲的真正侵略者是那些发号施令，并强使别人接受对国家利益和和平有害的政策的军国主义势力。
    报告最后叙述了已在拉丁美洲国家展开的、争取缓和国际紧张局势，争取自由贸易和文化交流的斗争。这一斗争已有相当大的声势，并产生了初步结果，特别是在和苏联以及各人民民主国家的贸易方面。与这同时，还在进行着保卫国家主权的斗争。
    会议接着就巴西代表团的报告进行讨论。
    首先发言的是哥伦比亚作家乌里贝。他说，扩张军备和“冷战”的政策使得拉丁美洲国家陷于贫困境地，使得公民自由和民主权利受到限制，造成了国民经济不稳定，加强了它们的经济依赖性。外国、首先是美国的资本统治着这些国家，掠夺它们的天然富源。乌里贝说：拉丁美洲国家的人民希望独立和和平。和平运动主张把拉丁美洲变成和平的堡垒，使各国之间的关系以中华人民共和国和印度所宣布的五项原则为基础。
    墨西哥前海军部长哈拉将军接着发言。哈拉在他的发言中讲到西方国家对落后国家人民所采取的帝国主义政策。哈拉说，帝国主义国家不顾各国人民的意志而把他们的国家武装起来，利用别国的经济困难而在所谓“援助”的幌子下剥夺它们的自由。哈拉说，美国资本渗入拉丁美洲市场后，就不愿在这些国家当客人了。它想当主人，想当老爷了。为了奴役别国，就虚构出一种“共产主义威胁”来。
    哈拉最后说，拉丁美洲的弟兄们只有和世界和平力量的先锋队一致行动，才能获得和平生活和取得幸福的权利。
    接着，主席刘宁一宣布，大会接到了因为美国当局拒绝签发护照不能来出席会议的、卓越的和平战士保罗·罗伯逊的来信。罗伯逊在信中叙述了美国的进步力量如何为和平而奋斗，谈到他不久以前在国内的旅行，在旅行期间他又一次相信：千百万正直的美国人是希望和平的。罗伯逊并热切地希望会议成功。
    会议上还放了罗伯逊的简短祝词和他为庆祝世界和平理事会会议而演唱的歌曲的录音。到会的人在听完录音之后都起立并发出暴风雨般的掌声。会场上响起了“和平万岁”的呼声。
    在作家阿达尔伯托·奥尔蒂斯（厄瓜多尔）和智利上议院副议长萨尔瓦多·阿伦德发言之后，会议宣布休息。
    拉丁美洲劳工联盟主席伦巴多·托列达诺在休息后发言。他指出，由于美国对拉丁美洲各国所实行的政策，在拉丁美洲许多国家里，合法的政府被暴力推翻了，建立了暴力政权。在这些国家里，实行了许多反民主的措施。许多美国政治特务在拉丁美洲活动着。伦巴多·托列达诺接着说，拉丁美洲各国人民了解，虽然他们的领土广大，居民众多，但他们却无法在国际生活中起决定性的作用，这是因为他们被剥夺了支配自己命运的权利。因此，他们总是把战争和和平的问题同自己国家独立的问题紧紧地联系在一起。
    托列达诺最后提出一项建议：在一九五五年上半年召开会议讨论拉丁美洲问题，以维护和扩大这些国家的民主自由、保卫它们的国家独立、执行同各国友好、通商及文化交流的政策。
    阿根廷作家瓦雷拉谈了阿根廷国内争取和平的斗争。他说：最近阿根廷同苏联和各人民民主国家的贸易交流已经扩大了。我们的商品过去是找不到市场的，现在可以输往这些国家，而从这些国家获得我国所必需的机器和其他商品。阿根廷政府采取扩大贸易的决定是由于各阶层人民的要求。
    巴格达大学教授赛利姆·艾哈迈德就第二项议程发言。他说，在苏联和人民民主国家四围建立军事基地包围圈，以及把伊拉克拖入这个军事体系，对和平事业是一个严重威胁。伊拉克统治集团在国内建立恐怖统治，迫害和平拥护者。但是伊拉克的爱国力量不怕镇压，正在加紧斗争。他们要求废除英伊（拉克）条约，撤退外国军队，拒绝强加于伊拉克的所谓美“援”。
    在会议上发言的还有古巴卫生工作者工会联合会主席艾伯托·罗·苏斯特和丹麦神甫汉森。
      【新华社二十三日讯】据塔斯社斯德哥尔摩二十二日讯：世界和平理事会十一月二十一日上午继续举行会议。
    在以色列议会议员杜比发言后，保加利亚科学院副院长、保加利亚保卫和平全国委员会执行局主席格奥尔基·纳德热科夫发言。他说：和平拥护者有必要采取新的措施，动员一切和平力量来打破复活德国军国主义的计划。他还号召会议支持印度科学工作者协会的建议：立即召开国际科学工作者会议，以寻求禁止各种大规模毁灭性武器和防止把科学和科学家用于残杀人类的目的的方法。
    接着发言的是初次参加世界和平理事会工作的爱尔兰基督教非战主义者阿姆斯特朗牧师以及突尼斯代表本·斯利曼博士。
    土耳其新闻工作者图纳发言说，美国正在把土耳其变成一个军事基地。土耳其国家预算的百分之六十以上都被拨作军事用款。目前土耳其的外债总数达一亿八千万美元，而且仍在不断增加。失业人数正在不断增加，人民的生活水平正在下降。
    西班牙建筑师、前共和西班牙大使阿卡斯在发言中揭露了美国利用西班牙来准备新战争的计划。他说，西班牙人民反对战争计划，反对分裂欧洲。他们希望实现苏联提出的建立欧洲集体安全体系的建议。
    在阿卡斯发言后，会议开始讨论第五项议程：准备在一九五五年上半年召开世界和平大会。
    印度代表阿巴斯就这一项议程作了报告。他分析了世界和平运动在过去五年中所取得的成就，并指出战争的威胁并没有消除。阿巴斯说：在将于一九五五年举行的世界和平大会上，应该受到最大注意的问题之一，就是禁止原子武器的问题。阿巴斯建议组织一个特别科学委员会来准备关于禁止原子武器和化学武器以及关于把原子能用于和平用途的可能性的报告。阿巴斯指出，应该在大会上提出讨论的其他问题是：美国在东南亚的干涉、反对殖民制度的斗争、苏联政府的声明所产生的各国和平共处的条件和中印、中缅关系所根据的五项原则。阿巴斯还建议大会讨论扩大各国之间的文化联系的问题。他指出，印度同苏联及各人民民主国家之间的大规模文化关系已经发展起来。
    皮·麦尼埃（法国）在发言中叙述了即将举行的大会的任务。他说，世界各国的公众能够而且必须防止国际紧张局势的加剧。舆论正在世界事务中起着越来越重要的作用，这主要是世界和平运动进行活动的结果。
    何·库埃托（智利）发言。他建议在召开世界和平大会前先召开一次特别会议来考虑由于帝国主义国家在拉丁美洲国家中执行殖民政策而引起的局势。
    准备召开明年的世界和平大会也是艾弗·蒙塔古（英国）发言的主题。他说，现在已是召集一次新的大会来给予我们的运动以新的推动力的时候了。然而，我们不想包办代替。我们不打算在我们的运动和其他运动之间划任何界线。我们将向一切希望和平的人呼吁。蒙塔古又说，世界人民和平大会的准备工作应在争取世界和平和反对最后分裂欧洲的口号下进行。我们的任务是要向人民解释局势的真正意义。如果巴黎协定获得批准，那么，德国就会被武装起来、欧洲就要不可挽回地陷于分裂，各国人民之间合作的问题就会更加复杂了。
    接着，会议主席福贝克宣布：会议已接到劳动人民、科学家、公众领袖和政治家们的贺电。
    会议在“瑞典左翼妇女联盟”代表团致贺后，宣布休会。
    【新华社二十三日讯】据塔斯社斯德哥尔摩二十二日讯：世界和平理事会会议二十二日在委员会和小组委员会中进行讨论。
    参加会议的人还在陆续来到斯德哥尔摩。在十一月二十一日到达的有德意志民主共和国副总理奥托·努舍克。
    本届会议在举行全体会议和各委员会进行工作的同时，还举行了许多促进建立和加强社会名流之间的联系的会议。如出席会议的各国科学家和瑞典科学家的会议，全体亚洲国家代表团的会议，全体欧洲国家代表团的会议，出席会议的各国作家代表和瑞典作家的会议。瑞典、挪威、丹麦、波兰、德国和苏联的代表团同“和平航行”的参加者举行的会议。
    瑞典的许多城市都举行了和平拥护者大会，庆祝世界和平理事会会议。在特雷列堡，由瑞（典）苏协会主持召开的大会拍贺电给出席会议的苏联代表团说：“请向主席团委员和全体代表转达我们的祝贺以及我们希望国际紧张局势得以缓和的愿望。各国之间的会谈和相互谅解是全世界和平的基础。”
