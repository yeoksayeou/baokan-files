    Jiangxi, Henan, and Zhejiang Farmers Enthusiastically Sell Surplus Grain
    [Our Newspaper] Farmers in various parts of Jiangxi Province are enthusiastically delivering grain for tax and sale to state warehouses. As of November 22nd, the amount of public grain stored in the province reached 94% of the planned collection, and the amount of grain purchased and stored reached 76.33% of the planned purchase. The total amount of surplus grain sold in the Ji'an Special District this year is 8.62% more than last year.
    When delivering grain, agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in various places served as the core, with entire villages and townships collectively delivering grain. Farmers in Jianshe Township, Yongxin County, transported 110,000 jin of grain to the warehouse in one morning. In order to ensure that grain is stored on time, Liu Guigen's mutual aid team in Hanleng Township, Yichun County, after delivering all the grain sold by the team, extracted eight laborers to help families lacking labor to deliver grain, ensuring that each team and each household cleared their obligations without leaving any arrears. Currently, many farmers who have sold their surplus grain have invested the proceeds into production.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, November 27th: The grain unified purchase work in Henan Province this year has entered a high tide. Now, an average of thousands of townships across the province are automatically selling large quantities of surplus grain to local grain purchasing stations in accordance with the state's grain purchase plan. As of November 22nd, farmers across the province had sold more than 450 million jin of grain to the state. Farmers in Xinyang Special District, where rice production increased this year, have now sold more than 180 million jin of rice and autumn grain to the state, accounting for more than 70% of the state's planned purchase of surplus grain in this area. Xingyang County achieved universal harvests of various crops this autumn, and the number of households selling surplus grain in the county increased by 10% to 20% compared to the unified purchase last winter. The amount of surplus grain sold to the state this autumn is nearly double the amount sold during the unified purchase of summer grain this year.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, November 27th: The grain unified purchase work in Zhejiang Province is gradually unfolding. As of November 20th, the grain unified purchase and storage in the province has completed 44% of the annual purchase plan. The amount of grain purchased by state grain departments in the recent half-month is more than double that of the same period last year. According to preliminary statistics, more than 700 townships across the province have basically completed the unified purchase work. Jinhua, Ningbo, Wenzhou, and Zhoushan Special Districts have all completed more than 55% of their unified purchase tasks. Jiaxing Special District, which has a later harvest season, has also begun purchasing late japonica rice.
    The total grain output in Zhejiang Province this year has increased compared to last year. Agricultural production cooperatives and areas directly supported by industry have more surplus grain this year. Ningfeng Township in Yin County achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of rice irrigated by pumping stations this year. The township provided approximately 400,000 jin more commodity grain to the state than last year. Many farmers in previously grain-deficient areas that experienced bumper harvests this year also have surplus grain to sell. Recently, continuous victories have been reported from the coastal defense front lines, further boosting farmers' enthusiasm for selling grain.

    江西河南浙江农民踊跃出售余粮
   【本报讯】江西省各地农民把应征和出售的粮食踊跃送入国家仓库，到十一月二十二日止全省公粮入库数字达征收计划的百分之九十四，购粮入库数字达收购计划的百分之七十六点三三。吉安专区今年出售余粮总数比去年多百分之八点六二。
    在送粮时，各地都以农业生产合作社、互助组为核心，整村整乡集体送粮。永新县建设乡农民在一个早晨运送了十一万斤粮食入库。为了保证粮食按时入库，宜春县寒冷乡刘桂根互助组送完全组卖出的粮食后，又抽出八个劳动力帮助缺乏劳动力的人家送粮，做到一组清、户户清，不留尾欠。目前许多卖了余粮的农民已把所得款项投入生产。
    据新华社郑州二十七日电：河南省今年的粮食统购工作已进入高潮。现在，全省每天平均都有上千个乡的农民，自动按照国家的购粮计划，把大批余粮卖给各地购粮站。到十一月二十二日止，全省农民已卖给国家四亿五千多万斤粮食。今年水稻增产的信阳专区农民现在已向国家出卖了大米和秋粮一亿八千多万斤，占国家在这个地区收购余粮计划的百分之七十多。荥阳县今秋各种作物获得普遍丰收，全县出卖余粮的户数比去冬统购时卖粮的户数增加百分之十到二十。全县今秋卖给国家的余粮比今年夏粮统购时多了将近一倍。
    据新华社杭州二十七日电：浙江省粮食统购工作正逐步展开。到十一月二十日止，全省统购入库的粮食已完成年度收购计划的百分之四十四。国家粮食部门在最近半个月收购粮食的数量，相当于去年同时期的二倍多。据初步统计，全省已有七百多个乡基本结束统购工作。金华、宁波、温州、舟山专区都已完成统购任务的百分之五十五以上。收获季节较晚的嘉兴专区也已开始收购晚粳稻。
    浙江省今年的粮食总产量比去年增加。农业生产合作社和直接受到工业支援的地区，今年的余粮较多。鄞县宁锋乡今年得到抽水机站灌溉的水稻空前丰收。全乡为国家提供的商品粮比去年增加四十万斤左右。不少丰收地区原来缺粮的农民，今年也都有余粮出售。最近海防前线不断传来胜利消息，农民卖粮情绪更加高涨。
