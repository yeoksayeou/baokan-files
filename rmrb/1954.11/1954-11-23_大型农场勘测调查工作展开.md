    Large-Scale Farm Survey and Investigation Work Unfolds

    [Reported from Fulitun, Heilongjiang Province, November 22nd] On the wasteland designated for a large-scale state-owned grain farm, hundreds of bright red and white survey flags flutter in the wind, indicating that the farm's land surveying and investigation work has fully commenced. Every morning, six or seven vehicles carrying Soviet experts, Chinese experts, technicians, and surveyors depart from Xinglong Town in Jixian County (the location of the land consolidation and investigation team), heading towards the various designated areas of the wasteland in the glow of the morning sun. At dusk, the cars, with their lights on, return one after another, carrying the people who have been busy all day.

    After the arrival of the experts from the Land Consolidation and Investigation Team of the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture, headed by N.S. Maslov, in Xinglong Town, they began a comprehensive survey and investigation of the site on the 17th after several days of preparation. Thanks to the strong support and information provided by local land surveyors and relevant departments, the work is progressing rapidly.

    Participating in this land surveying and investigation work are fourteen Soviet experts, headed by N.S. Maslov, specializing in land consolidation, soil science, and hydraulic engineering, as well as dozens of Chinese agronomists, soil scientists, hydraulic engineers, and land surveying technicians assisting the Soviet experts.

    The first task of land consolidation is to survey and plan the boundaries of the farm and measure the land area. Over the past four days, the survey team has simultaneously planted many stakes around the farm from the east, west, and north, and erected survey flags on more than half of the marginal land. The hydrographic survey team has excavated more than thirty groundwater test pits in several different areas of the wasteland belonging to the farm and has made preliminary observations of the groundwater conditions in recent days. They have also examined the current flow of the Qixing River, located more than 30 li south of the farm and closely related to it, and the existing levee conditions of the Qixing River. They have also interviewed local farmers to make a preliminary investigation of the maximum flood level of the Qixing River. The soil survey team has completed a key observation of soil types, and the first batch of soil samples taken has been sent to relevant scientific institutions for testing. They have also begun to use the grid survey method to conduct a more detailed and in-depth classification of soil types and a study of soil profiles. They have also collected various plant specimens to carry out plant classification in order to further study land use and prepare the necessary information for the farm's land planning and design.

    大型农场勘测调查工作展开
    【本报黑龙江省福利屯二十二日电】大型国营谷物农场场地的荒原上，数百面红白鲜明的测旗迎风招展，这个农场的土地勘测、调查工作已全面展开。每天早晨，六、七辆汽车载着苏联专家、中国专家、技术人员和测量工人们，迎着朝霞从集贤县兴隆镇（土地整理考察组驻地）出发，向着荒原的各个预定地区驶去。黄昏，闪着灯光的汽车才载着忙碌一天的人们陆续归来。
    以尼·谢·马斯洛夫为首的苏联农业部土地整理考察组的专家们到达兴隆镇后，经过几天的准备，十七日便开始了对场地的全面勘测和调查工作。由于当地土地勘测工作者和有关方面提供了有力的资料，工作进展速度很快。
    参加这次土地勘测、调查工作的，有以尼·谢·马斯洛夫为首的包括土地整理、土壤、水利工程方面的十四位苏联专家；还有协助苏联专家工作的中国的农学家、土壤学家、水利工程师和土地勘测方面的技术人员数十人。
    土地整理的第一个工作是勘测和规划出农场的地界，进行土地面积的测量。四天来，测量小组已同时从东、西、北三个方面，环绕农场插上了许多标桩，在二分之一以上的边缘地段上，插起测旗。水利调查小组在农场所属荒原的几个不同地区，挖掘了三十多个地下水试坑，这几天初步观察了地下水的情况。他们还察看了位于农场以南三十多里对农场有密切关系的七星河目前的流量和七星河的现有堤防情况，并访问了当地老农民，初步调查出七星河的最大洪水位。土壤调查小组已结束了土壤种类的重点观察，第一批取出的土壤标本已送往有关科学机关化验。他们并开始用方格调查法，更细致深入地进行土壤种类的区分和土壤剖面的研究。他们还采集了各种植物标本，准备进行植物分类，以进一步研究土地的利用，为农场的土地规划设计准备必要的资料。
