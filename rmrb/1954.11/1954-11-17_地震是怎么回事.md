Earthquakes have occurred in many parts of our country this year. Provinces such as Gansu, Anhui, Hubei, Hebei, Yunnan, and Sichuan have experienced earthquakes of varying magnitudes. An earthquake is a natural phenomenon. On average, over a hundred earthquakes occur worldwide every hour, with about twenty being noticeable or more intense. However, their distribution across the Earth is uneven, with some areas experiencing more and others less.

From years of instrumental earthquake observations, combined with relevant scientific theories, we have gained some knowledge of the secrets of the Earth's internal structure. The Earth's surface is covered by a crust that is tens of kilometers thick. Below it lies a solid and uniform mantle, about two thousand nine hundred kilometers thick. Beneath the mantle is the Earth's core, with a fluid outer core and a solid inner core. The Earth as it is today evolved from billions of years ago. From its birth to the present, it has been in a constant state of motion, change, and development. Earthquakes occur when the Earth's crust suddenly shifts and fractures during this movement.

Why do the rock layers that make up the Earth's crust shift and fracture? The rock layers forming the Earth's crust are visibly fractured. Generally speaking, the density of the upper layer of material is smaller than that of the lower layer, so the Earth's crust surface is like an iceberg floating on the sea. Its stability depends entirely on whether the forces it receives can maintain equilibrium. The part that loses its balance will move. What forces are at play? The most easily observed is pressure. The pressure on the Earth's crust is constantly changing. We can see that rocks on high mountains erode in wind and rain, constantly flowing to lower places to be deposited. In this way, the high places lose the weight of the rocks, and the pressure gradually decreases; the low places accumulate sand and gravel, and the pressure gradually increases. This is the change of external forces. There are other external forces, such as the centrifugal force and tidal force caused by the Earth's rotation. Secondly, there are internal forces. The Earth's crust contains a large amount of radioactive material. The heat released creates temperature differences in all directions, causing complex internal changes, which unbalance the internal pressure. Weak zones that cannot withstand the pressure will arch upward, so even very thick sedimentary rock layers will gradually rise. For example, the Himalayas were formed by the uplift of the ancient Mediterranean seabed. Because the forces acting on the Earth's crust deep inside are constantly changing, the Earth moves and changes accordingly. However, the movement of the Earth's crust is very slow; the amount of movement is not perceptible within a person's lifetime. The age of the Earth is calculated with one million years as one year.

The Earth is in perpetual motion. When the strength of the rock is still able to withstand the pressure, nothing happens. Once it encounters a weak zone that cannot withstand the pressure, it will suddenly break, and shifting or fracturing will cause vibration, which is an earthquake. Strong earthquakes can cause disasters.

The place where the geological layer suddenly breaks, which is also the place where the earthquake occurs, is called the hypocenter. The depth of the hypocenter varies; some are very shallow, some are very deep; but most earthquakes originate at a depth of ten to thirty or forty kilometers, with some as deep as six or seven hundred kilometers. Deep earthquakes are rare in our country; there are some in Northeast China and a few in western Yunnan. The point on the ground directly above the hypocenter is called the epicenter. The area around the epicenter will experience the strongest shaking when an earthquake occurs.

Some earthquakes are very weak and can only be observed with seismographs that magnify tens of thousands of times. Some earthquakes are so large that they can destroy cities. For example, the great Ningxia earthquake in the third year of the Qianlong reign of the Qing Dynasty destroyed the two cities of Pingluo and Baofeng.

During an earthquake, the destruction of the geological layer triggers vibrations, which generate elastic waves that propagate outward in all directions, through the Earth, at varying depths, or along the surface to various places. The great Haiyuan earthquake in Gansu in 1920 was felt in Beijing, and even the electric lights swayed. People study earthquakes by capturing these elastic waves, designing various seismic instruments to observe them from a distance, and recording the seismic waves on photographic paper as basic data for research.

    地震是怎么回事
    中国科学院地球物理研究所研究员　李善邦
    我国今年有好些地方发生了地震，甘肃、安徽、湖北、河北、云南、四川等省都曾发生大小不同的地震。地震是一种自然现象，全世界平均每小时要发生一百多次地震，其中人可以感觉到的和更剧烈的也有二十次。因为在地球上分布不均匀，有的地方比较多，有的地方就比较少。
    从历年用仪器观测地震的结果，结合有关科学的理论，我们对于地球内部构造的秘密已经知道了一些。地球表面有厚几十公里的地壳包着，下面是坚实而均匀的物质构成中间层，厚约二千九百公里。地壳下面是地核，地核外半部是具有流体性的，里核具有固体性的东西。现在的地球是从几十万万年前进化而来的，它自初生到现在，一直在不断地运动、变化、发展过程中。地震就是地壳在运动过程中突然转位和破裂时发生的。
    为什么构成地壳的岩层会转位会破裂呢？构成地壳的岩层，从表面就可看出它是破碎的。总的来说，上层物质的密度要比下层小，所以地壳表层好像冰山在海上浮着。它的稳定性全靠所受到的各方面的力能不能维持平衡来决定。那一部分失了平衡，那一部分就会动起来。有那些力在起作用呢？最容易看到的就是压力。地壳所受的压力是在变化着的。我们可以看到高山的岩石随风雨剥蚀、不断地流到低的地方去沉积起来。这样高处就失去了岩石的重量，压力逐渐减轻；低处积累了沙石，压力渐渐增加。这是外力变化。还有别的外力，如地球自转所引起的离心力、潮力等。其次是内力，地壳中存在大量的放射性物质，放出来的热使各方面有了温度差，因而引起内部很复杂的变化，使内部压力失去平衡，经不起压的软弱地带就会向上拱，所以沉积很厚的岩层也会逐渐上升。例如喜马拉雅山就是古时候的地中海底上升而成的。因为地壳深处受着外力和内力的作用常在变化，地就随着运动和变化。不过地壳运动是很缓慢的，不是一个人的有生时间可以觉察多少的，地球年龄是用一百万年为一岁来计算的。
    地在永恒地运动着，当岩石强度，还抵抗得住压力时，可以保持无事，一遇到脆弱地带经不住压力就会突然毁坏，而转位或破裂同时引起震动，那就是地震。强烈的地震便酿成灾害。
    地层突然毁坏的地方，也就是地震发生的地方，我们称它为震源。震源的深度有的很小，有的很大；但大多数地震发源于十多公里至三、四十公里的深度，有的深到六、七百公里。我国深的地震很少，东北有一些，云南西部也有一些。从震源直上的地面就叫做震中，在震中周围的地区，当地震发生时会受到最强烈的震动。
    地震有的很微弱，需要几万倍放大的地震仪才能观测出来。有的地震很大，可以毁灭城市。例如清乾隆三年宁夏大地震，曾毁坏平罗、宝丰二城。
    地震时由于地层破坏激起震动，产生了弹性波动向四外传播，通过地球或浅或深或沿地面传到各地。一九二零年甘肃海原大地震，北京也感觉得到，电灯都摇摆。人们研究地震就是抓住这种弹性波，设计出各种地震仪器从远处观测，把震波用照相纸记录下来，作为研究的基本资料。　（新华社）
