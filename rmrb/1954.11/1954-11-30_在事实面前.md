    In the Face of Facts
    Yuan Mingliang

    A State Statistical Bureau directive regarding inventory surveys lay on the desk of the deputy director of the Shanghai Electricity Meter Factory, who was in charge of supply and sales. The directive stipulated that an inventory survey should be conducted nationwide on October 1st, with all inventory materials being counted and weighed to obtain accurate figures, which would then be used to formulate the 1955 material allocation plan.

    The deputy director looked at the directive, shook his head slightly, and said to Wang, the head of the supply and sales section, "We just had a thorough inventory clearing in July, only a little over two months ago. Let's skip the counting and weighing this time!"

    A hint of hesitation appeared on Wang's face. The deputy director's tone became more firm: "The superior's directives should be implemented flexibly, you know! Just fill in the material account figures into the report and write a summary."

    Since the deputy director had given such a firm instruction, the section head had no choice but to comply. Thus, the preparations for the inventory survey were shelved.

    Soon, an inventory survey inspection team dispatched by the State Statistical Bureau arrived at the Shanghai Electricity Meter Factory. The Shanghai Electricity Meter Factory's practice of not implementing the directive to count inventory materials, and attempting to substitute material account figures for weighed figures in the report, immediately attracted the attention of the inspection team. Section Chief Wang hurriedly explained, "This is the opinion of the factory leaders… The inventory clearing in July was relatively thorough. You are welcome to visit the warehouse for an on-site inspection."

    Although it was "relatively thorough" and "welcome to visit," Section Chief Wang had not forgotten to leave himself an out: "Of course, the work still has shortcomings, and many shortcomings. Our factory's production tasks are quite busy, and materials are being received day and night, so... so, in terms of the material supply system, we haven't done a good enough job..."

    It turned out that not long ago, the factory had implemented a "night material issuance method," which involved the warehouse keeper handing the keys to the security guard after work, so that workshops could register with the security guard to receive materials, supposedly to avoid work stoppages due to lack of materials.

    The supply and sales section chief felt that this method was prone to errors and made it difficult to assign responsibility, so he had raised his concerns with the deputy director. The deputy director replied bluntly: "This is the decision of the factory leadership, just follow it! This method is practical and feasible; this is possible during the transition period.”

    After understanding these circumstances, the inspection team believed that the material supply work at the Shanghai Electricity Meter Factory was relatively chaotic and that there might be problems. They asked Section Chief Wang to relay to the factory leaders that they should reconsider immediately and organize a force to carry out the inventory survey work in accordance with the State Statistical Bureau's directive.

    A few days later, the inspection team came to find the deputy director. The deputy director was indeed busy and they had to wait. After a while, the deputy director arrived and said bluntly, "If you don't believe it, take a look for yourselves! Facts speak louder than words!"

    The comrades of the inspection team invited the deputy director to go to the warehouse together. The deputy director said, "I don't have time, I have a meeting waiting for me."

    The factory's vice chairman of the trade union, who was also in charge of warehouse work, was also attending the meeting and could not accompany them.

    Later, they finally agreed to go to the warehouse with the inspection team. Perhaps they also wanted to see how the comrades of the inspection team would bow their heads in the face of the eloquent facts!

    First, they visited the wire and material warehouse. The first random check was on No. 17 wire and material. The person weighing the material shouted loudly: "Three hundred sixty point zero four catties!" Everyone's eyes followed the shout to the ledger. The stock on the ledger was six catties more than the weighed amount.

    The second random check was on No. 32 wire and material. The weighed amount was two hundred thirty point seven five catties, which was ten point two one catties less than the stock on the ledger.

    Next came an embarrassing silence. The deputy director looked at the vice chairman of the trade union, and the vice chairman of the trade union looked at the deputy director. The deputy director remained calm, but the vice chairman of the trade union's face gradually turned red. Finally, someone broke the silence: "What's so important about such a small difference, we have so much coming in and going out here..."

    Since there was "nothing important" here, they went to another warehouse. This time, the random check was on 3 mm thin sheets. The stock on the ledger was twelve point four catties, but the actual weight was three hundred catties more; another random check was on 16 mm brass blanks, the stock on the ledger was one hundred eighty-nine point six six catties, but the actual weight was fifty-eight point six six catties less. This wasn't "a small difference" either.

    This time, the deputy director's face also changed. The vice chairman of the trade union kept touching his head and pacing around erratically, while muttering and searching around with his eyes: "Where did some of the brass blanks go..."

    Thank goodness, they finally found them. The vice chairman of the trade union shouted at the top of his lungs: "Ha, it's here!"

    People crowded around the newly discovered pile of brass blanks. Just as this pile of brass blanks was about to be put on the scale, a hand reached out from the crowd and clamped a caliper onto the brass blanks, immediately exposing the vice chairman of the trade union's secret: It turned out that the vice chairman of the trade union had brought 17.5 mm brass blanks to try to pass them off as 16 mm brass blanks.

    The deputy director waved his arm: "Call an emergency meeting tomorrow..."

    Section Chief Wang, who was standing nearby, said: "Don't wait until tomorrow, let's have it today!"

    Later, the Shanghai Electricity Meter Factory recounted and re-weighed the materials in the warehouse. The result of the counting was that a large portion of the material quantities on the ledger did not match the actual weighed quantities.

    在事实面前
    袁明亮
    一份国家统计局关于库存调查的指示，躺在上海电表厂负责领导供销工作的副厂长的办公桌上。指示规定十月一日在全国范围内举行库存调查，将库存物资清点过磅，取得准确数字，好据以制订一九五五年的物资分配计划。
    这位副厂长看了看这份指示，把头微微一摇，对供销科王科长说：“七月里刚搞过清仓工作，做得比较彻底，才不过两个多月，这一次就不要清点过磅了吧！”
    王科长脸上稍微露了一点犹疑的神色。副厂长的口气更坚决了：“上级的指示要灵活执行，知道吗！把料账数字填到报表里，写个书面总结就行了。”
    既然副厂长下了这样坚决的指示，科长只好照办，于是库存调查的准备工作就搁下来了。
    不久，国家统计局派出的库存调查工作检查组到了上海电表厂。上海电表厂不执行清点库存物资的指示，企图以料账数字代替过磅数字填入表报的做法，马上引起了检查组的注意。王科长慌忙解释道：“这是厂里领导同志的意见……七月里的清仓工作是比较彻底的。欢迎你们到仓库实地参观。”
    虽然是“比较彻底”，“欢迎参观”，王科长也还没有忘记留条后路：“自然，工作还有缺点，而且缺点还很多。我们厂里生产任务比较忙，白天黑夜都在领料，所以……所以在，在这材料供应制度方面，做得还是不够好的……”
    原来，不久以前，厂部规定了一个“黑夜发料办法”，叫仓库管理员下班后把钥匙交给警卫员，车间要领料就向警卫员登记，据说这是为了避免停工待料。
    供销科长觉得这个办法很容易发生差错，而且也很难分清责任，所以曾向副厂长提过意见。副厂长回答得很干脆：“这是厂部的决定，照着办吧！这个办法是切实可行的，过渡时期嘛，是可以这样的。”
    检查组了解了这些情况，认为上海电表厂材料供应工作是比较混乱的，里面可能有问题，就请王科长转告厂方领导同志重新考虑一下，马上组织力量，按照国家统计局的指示，进行库存调查工作。
    过了几天，检查组来找这位副厂长。副厂长也实在忙，左等右等等不到。隔了一阵，副厂长来了，劈头就说：“你们不相信，实地看看好了！事实胜于雄辩！”
    检查组的同志邀请副厂长一齐到仓库去看看。副厂长说：“我没空，马上有个会等着我。”
    工厂的工会副主席也在场，他兼管仓库工作，也要参加会议，难以奉陪。
    后来，他们总算答应和检查组一道到仓库去了。也许，他们还想看一看检查组的同志如何在胜于雄辩的事实面前低头哩！
    首先参观线料仓库。第一次抽查的是十七号线料。过磅的人大声喊着：“三百六十点零四市斤！”大家的眼光随着喊声移到账面上去。账面上的存量比过磅数却多了六市斤。
    第二次抽查的是三十二号线料。过磅的数目是二百三十点七五市斤，比账面上的存量又少了十点二一市斤。
    接着是一个难堪的哑场。副厂长望望工会副主席，工会副主席望望副厂长。副厂长还保持着镇静，工会副主席的脸却渐渐红了。终于，有人打破了哑场：“差这么一点点有什么了不起，我们这里进进出出这么多……”
    既然这里“没有什么了不起”的，就到另一处仓库去吧。这次抽查的是三公厘的薄板。账面上的存量是十二点四市斤，实际过磅多出三百多市斤，这不是“差一点点”了；再抽查十六公厘的黄铜元，账面上的存量是一百八十九点六六市斤，实际过磅少了五十八点六六市斤，这也不是
  “差一点点”了。
    这回，副厂长的脸色也变了。工会副主席一面不停地用手摸着脑袋，步履混乱地踱来踱去，一面用眼睛向四处搜索，口中念念有词地叨咕道：“还有些黄铜元弄到那里去啦……”
    谢天谢地，到底发现了，工会副主席拉长着嗓子喊道：“哈，原来在这里！”
    人们拥向新发现的一堆黄铜元。正当这堆黄铜元要抬上磅称时，人丛中伸出一只手来，一付卡钳往黄铜元上一卡，马上戳破了工会副主席的隐情：原来工会副主席把十七点五公厘的黄铜元找来想顶上十六公厘的黄铜元。
    副厂长把手臂一挥：“明天召开紧急会议……”
    站在一旁的王科长说：“不要明天了吧，今天就开吧！”
    后来，上海电表厂把仓库材料重新清点过磅了一次。清点的结果是：账面数量和实际过磅的材料数量一大半都不相符。
