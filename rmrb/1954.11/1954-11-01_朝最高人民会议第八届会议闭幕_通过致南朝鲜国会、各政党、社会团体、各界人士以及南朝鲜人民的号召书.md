Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 31st: The 8th Session of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which lasted for three days, closed on October 30th.

    The session, after hearing Foreign Minister Nam Il's report on the work of the government delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea at the Geneva Conference regarding the peaceful resolution of the Korean question on the 28th, conducted heated discussions on the 29th and unanimously passed a resolution. The resolution fully supports and agrees with the policies and work of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland and calls for continued efforts and struggles to realize the peaceful reunification and independence of the fatherland. The resolution states: In order to peacefully resolve the Korean question by the Koreans themselves, so as to promote the peaceful reunification and independence of the fatherland, it is decided, in the name of the 8th Session of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, to issue an appeal to the South Korean National Assembly, political parties, social organizations, people from all walks of life, and all the South Korean people. The relevant appeal was passed at the meeting on the 30th.

    At the meeting on the 30th, a report by Vice Premier Hong Myong-hui on the Organization Law of Local Power Organs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was also heard, discussed, and passed. The Organization Law stipulates that the local state power organs and executive organs shall be clearly divided into people's assemblies and people's committees. The meeting then passed amendments and supplements to the provisions of the Constitution related to the Organization Law of Local Power Organs.

    The meeting also heard, discussed, and passed a report by Vice Premier Choe Chang-ik on the reorganization of local administrative division.

    The meeting approved the ordinances passed by the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly between the 7th and 8th sessions of the Supreme People's Assembly that require the approval of the Supreme People's Assembly.
    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 31st: The 8th Session of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea passed an appeal to the South Korean National Assembly, political parties, social organizations, people from all walks of life, and the South Korean people on October 30th.

    The appeal states: The 8th Session of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, representing the will of all the Korean people, proposes and appeals as follows:

    1. In order to discuss the issue of the peaceful reunification of the fatherland, a joint conference of representatives of political parties, social organizations, and people from all strata of North and South Korea, or a consultative conference between the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the National Assembly of the Republic of Korea, should be held in Pyongyang or Seoul in 1955.

    2. In order to discuss the issue of convening the above-mentioned conference and the issue of starting economic and cultural exchanges, trade, travel, and correspondence between North and South Korea, a conference of representatives from North and South Korea should be held in Panmunjom or Kaesong in February 1955.

    3. In order to seek countermeasures for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland, patriotic figures from all political parties, social organizations, and all strata of North and South Korea should contact each other, visit each other, and interact with each other. The authorities of North and South Korea should guarantee their freedom of movement throughout Korea.

    The appeal writes: The suffering of the Korean people due to the division of the fatherland is indescribable. All Koreans with a conscience have been striving for the reunification of the fatherland. The government delegation of the Republic made its utmost efforts at the Geneva Conference for the peaceful resolution of the Korean question. However, due to the obstruction of the American representatives and their lackeys, this conference failed to achieve success on the Korean question. However, the Korean question has not been removed from the agenda and cannot be removed. We believe that it is necessary to convene a conference with broad participation of various countries in the near future to re-discuss the Korean question.

    The appeal states: We must seek and take measures as soon as possible to create and develop friendly relations between the people of North and South Korea in all aspects, and strengthen economic exchanges to promote the peaceful reunification of the fatherland. We believe that if we eliminate the obstructionist plans of American imperialism and allow the Korean people to negotiate among themselves, the Korean question can be resolved.

    The appeal states: We welcome any form of consultation to discuss the issue of contact between the people of North and South Korea and the peaceful reunification of the fatherland. We fully support the proposal that representatives of political parties, social organizations, people from all strata, governments, or National Assemblies of North and South Korea gather together for consultation.

    The appeal concludes: We are convinced that all the Korean people will support and welcome this appeal, will be able to overcome all the conspiracies that hinder the peaceful resolution of the Korean question by the Koreans themselves, and will rise up to fight to put this appeal into practice.

    通过致南朝鲜国会、各政党、社会团体、各界人士以及南朝鲜人民的号召书
   【新华社平壤三十一日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议第八届会议举行了三天，在十月三十日闭幕。
    会议在二十八日听取南日外务相关于朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府代表团在日内瓦会议上对和平解决朝鲜问题的工作报告后，在二十九日进行了热烈的讨论，并一致通过了一项决定。决定完全支持和同意朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府为和平统一祖国的政策和工作，并要为实现祖国的和平统一和独立事业而继续努力和斗争。决定中说：为了由朝鲜人自己和平解决朝鲜问题，以便促进祖国的和平统一和独立，决定以朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议第八届会议的名义，向南朝鲜国会、各政党、社会团体、各界人士以及全体南朝鲜人民发出号召。有关的号召书在三十日的会议上被通过。
    在三十日的会议上，还听取、讨论并通过了洪命熹副首相关于朝鲜民主主义人民共和国地方政权机关组织法的报告。组织法规定：将地方国家权力机关和执行机关明确地区分为人民会议和人民委员会。会议接着通过了关于修正和补充与地方政权机关组织法有关的宪法的条款。
    会议又听取、讨论并通过了崔昌益副首相关于改编地方行政区域划分的报告。
    会议批准了最高人民会议常任委员会在最高人民会议第七届会议和第八届会议之间所通过的政令中需要最高人民会议批准的各项政令。
   【新华社平壤三十一日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议第八届会议十月三十日通过了致南朝鲜国会、各政党、社会团体、各界人士以及南朝鲜人民的号召书。
    号召书说：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议第八届会议代表全体朝鲜人民的意志，提议并号召如下：
    一、为了讨论祖国的和平统一问题，在一九五五年内在平壤或汉城召开南北朝鲜各政党、社会团体及各阶层代表联席会议或朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议和大韩民国国会的协商会议。
    二、为了讨论关于召开上述会议的问题和关于南北朝鲜之间开始经济及文化交流、通商、通行、书信往来的问题，在一九五五年二月在板门店或开城召开南北朝鲜代表会议。
    三、为了谋求和平统一祖国的对策，南北朝鲜各政党、社会团体和各阶层爱国人士应互相联络，互相往来，互相接触。南北朝鲜的政权当局应在全朝鲜境内保障他们的自由活动。
    号召书写道：朝鲜人民由于祖国的被分割而遭受的痛苦是难以形容的。凡有良心的朝鲜人，都一直为祖国的统一而努力。共和国政府代表团在日内瓦会议上对和平解决朝鲜问题尽了最大的努力。但由于美国代表和它的仆从者们的阻挠，这个会议未能在朝鲜问题上取得成就。然而，朝鲜问题并没有从议程上抹掉，而且也是不能被抹掉的。我们认为，有必要在最近的将来召开由各国广泛参加的会议，重新讨论朝鲜问题。
    号召书说：我们必须尽快寻求和采取措施，从各方面创造和发展南北朝鲜人民之间的友谊关系，加强经济交流，以促进祖国的和平统一。我们认为，如果我们排除美帝国主义的阻挠计划，由朝鲜人民自己进行协商，朝鲜问题就能够得到解决。
    号召书说：为了讨论关于南北朝鲜人民的接触和和平统一祖国的问题，我们欢迎任何形式的协商。我们完全支持由南北朝鲜各政党、社会团体、各阶层人士、政府或由南北朝鲜国会代表聚集在一起进行协商的主张。
    号召书最后说：我们确信：全体朝鲜人民一定支持和欢迎这一号召，能够战胜阻碍我们朝鲜人自己和平解决朝鲜问题的各种策划，并奋起进行斗争来实践这一号召。
