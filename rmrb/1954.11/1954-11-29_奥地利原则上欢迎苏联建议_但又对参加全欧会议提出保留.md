Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 28th: TASS Moscow, November 28th: The Austrian Embassy in Moscow delivered the Austrian government's reply to the Soviet government's note of the 13th to the Soviet Foreign Ministry on the 27th.

The reply stated: "The Federal Government welcomes in principle any conference that promotes the relaxation of international tensions and guarantees peace. However, the Federal Government maintains that detailed exchanges of views must precede the convening of a conference on resolving all-European security issues. Only if all countries genuinely concerned about resolving European issues participate in the conference can it accomplish its task."

The reply continued: "The Austrian Federal Government, in keeping with its policy of striving in principle to maintain friendly relations with all major powers, can only participate in the convening of a conference to resolve all-European issues, as proposed by the Soviet government in its note of November 13th, if at least all the major powers still occupying Austria sponsor the convening of this conference."

    奥地利原则上欢迎苏联建议
    但又对参加全欧会议提出保留
    【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十八日讯：奥地利驻莫斯科大使馆二十七日将奥地利政府对苏联政府十三日照会的复照交给苏联外交部。
    复照说：“联邦政府在原则上欢迎促进缓和国际紧张局势和保证和平的任何会议。但是，联邦政府主张，在召开关于解决全欧安全问题的会议之前必须先详尽地交换意见。只有真正关心解决欧洲问题的所有国家参加会议，这一会议才能完成它的任务。”
    复照继续说：“奥地利联邦政府本着力求原则上实行同所有大国保持友好关系的政策，所以只有在至少是继续占领奥地利的一切大国赞助这个会议召开的情况下，它才能参加苏联政府在十一月十三日的照会中所提出的召开解决全欧问题的会议。”
