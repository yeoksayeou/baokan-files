The Supreme People's Court of the People's Republic of China and the Ministry of Justice of the People's Republic of China jointly held a judicial symposium from November 1st to 17th. This symposium brought together more than 120 central and local judicial cadres, focusing on the study of the Organization Law of the People's Courts of the People's Republic of China, and combined with relevant issues of the Organization Law of the People's Procuratorates of the People's Republic of China. Finally, a consensus was reached on these two organization laws.

Through study and discussion, the judicial cadres from various regions who participated in the symposium further clarified the importance of strengthening the revolutionary legal system during the national construction period. Everyone believes that the promulgation of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China and the Organization Law of the People's Courts of the People's Republic of China and other laws marks that after the country enters the period of economic construction, it will use and strengthen the revolutionary legal system to manage the country. In the future, the country will need to use the revolutionary legal system to maintain revolutionary order, further consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, ensure the smooth progress of national economic construction, and protect citizens' democratic rights from infringement. The Organization Law of the People's Courts stipulates that the state's judicial power is uniformly exercised by the people's courts, that all citizens are equal in the application of the law, and that the people's courts conduct trials independently and are only subject to the law and other principles of legal unity, which reflects the strengthening of the power of our people's courts; it also shows that in the future, judicial work will have a more significant task in ensuring the country's socialist construction.

The fundamental task of the people's courts was further clarified at this symposium. That is: The people's courts should, through their unique function—judicial activities, further strengthen the dictatorship over the enemies of the people, and at the same time effectively protect the rights and legitimate interests of citizens; "implementing dictatorship" and "protecting democracy" are two unified and inseparable aspects of the task of the people's courts, and neglecting either aspect is wrong. The meeting also pointed out that the people's judicial work in the transitional period of the country must take "ensuring the smooth progress of the country's socialist construction and socialist transformation cause" as the guiding ideology for all work. The people's courts should first and foremost handle cases related to national economic construction and the central tasks of each period, and at the same time properly handle general criminal and civil cases related to the specific interests of the masses, which are directly or indirectly closely related to serving economic construction. The people's court is not simply a punishing organ, but should also use all its activities to educate citizens to be loyal to the motherland and consciously abide by the law.

The symposium also discussed various systems for further democratizing the work of the courts stipulated in the Organization Law of the People's Courts, combined with the past experience and current situation of the people's judicial work in our country. The meeting unanimously agreed that earnestly implementing these systems will better protect the democratic rights of both parties to the lawsuit and the people, and at the same time give all criminals the punishment they deserve, so as to make objective, fair and reasonable judgments. The open trial, defense, jury, litigation in the language and script of the nationality, and the election of the president and being responsible to and reporting work to the people's congress at the same level stipulated in the Organization Law of the Court are not simply some working systems of the court, but national systems stipulated in the Constitution. The formulation and implementation of these systems are first of all beneficial to the country and the people, and it embodies the further democratization of the political life of our people; at the same time, the implementation of these systems is also beneficial to judicial work, which will greatly change the face of our country's judicial work. The meeting specifically pointed out that in order to implement these systems, it is necessary to first establish democratic thinking and overcome conservative thinking, and strengthen the mass viewpoint of judicial cadres; establishing democratic thinking is the driving force for implementing various systems for the democratization of court work, and it is necessary to unify the democratic form and democratic essence in judicial work.

After the symposium, all participants expressed their determination to strive to implement the Organization Law of the People's Courts; and believed that organizing judicial work cadres across the country to earnestly study the Organization Law of the People's Courts and unify their thinking and understanding is the primary key to implementing the Organization Law of the People's Courts. The meeting also discussed the guiding principles and specific measures for organizing judicial cadres to study and implement the Organization Law of the Court. (Xinhua News Agency)

    最高人民法院和司法部联合召开司法座谈会
    中华人民共和国最高人民法院和中华人民共和国司法部在十一月一日到十七日联合召开司法座谈会。这次座谈会集中了一百二十多名中央和各地司法干部，着重对中华人民共和国人民法院组织法，并结合中华人民共和国人民检察院组织法有关问题进行了学习，最后，对这两个组织法取得了一致的认识。
    参加座谈会的各地司法干部经过学习和讨论，进一步明确了加强革命法制在国家建设时期的重要性。大家认为：现在中华人民共和国宪法和中华人民共和国人民法院组织法等法律的公布，标明了国家在进入经济建设时期以后，将运用和加强革命法制来管理国家。今后国家更需要以革命法制来维护革命秩序，进一步巩固人民民主专政，保障国家经济建设的顺利进行和保护公民民主权利不受侵犯。人民法院组织法规定国家审判权统一由人民法院行使，对任何公民在适用法律上一律平等，人民法院独立进行审判只服从法律等法制统一原则，正是反映了我国人民法院威力的加强；同时也说明了今后司法工作在保障国家社会主义建设中的任务更加重大。
    关于人民法院的根本任务，在这次座谈会上也进一步明确了。这就是：人民法院应通过其特有的职能——审判活动，进一步加强对人民的敌人的专政，同时又切实保护公民的权利和合法利益；“实行专政”和“保护民主”是人民法院任务中统一的不可分割的两个方面，忽视那一方面都是错误的。会议又指出：人民司法工作在国家过渡时期必须以“保障国家的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的顺利进行”为全部工作的指导思想。人民法院应首先和着重处理有关国家经济建设和每一时期的中心工作的案件，同时又应妥善处理有关群众具体利益的一般刑事和民事案件，这些案件直接或间接都同为经济建设服务有密切关联。人民法院不单纯是惩办机关，同时也应该用自己的全部活动教育公民忠于祖国，自觉地遵守法律。
    座谈会还结合我国人民司法工作过去的经验和当前情况，讨论了人民法院组织法中规定的法院工作更进一步民主化的各项制度。会议一致认为，认真执行这些制度，将能更好地保护诉讼双方当事人和人民群众的民主权利，同时对一切罪犯给以应得惩处，从而作出客观的公平合理的判决。法院组织法规定的实行公开审理、辩护、陪审、用本民族语言文字进行诉讼和院长选举并对本级人民代表大会负责和报告工作等制度，不单纯是法院方面的一些工作制度，而且是宪法中所规定的国家制度。这些制度的制定与执行首先是有利于国家和人民，它体现了我国人民政治生活的进一步民主化；同时这些制度的实行，也有利于审判工作，它将大大改变我国司法工作的面貌。会议特别指出，贯彻这些制度必须首先树立民主思想和克服保守思想，加强司法干部的群众观点；树立民主思想是贯彻法院工作民主化的各项制度的动力，必须将审判工作中的民主形式和民主实质统一起来。
    经过座谈，参加会议的人都表示决心要努力贯彻人民法院组织法；并认为组织全国司法工作干部认真学好人民法院组织法，统一思想认识，是贯彻人民法院组织法的首要关键。会议还讨论了组织司法干部学习和贯彻法院组织法的方针和具体措施。 （新华社）
