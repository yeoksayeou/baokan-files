    Jingdezhen Porcelain Production Continuously Increases
    Jingdezhen City, Jiangxi Province, plans to produce 800,000 dan of porcelain in 1955 to meet the needs of domestic and foreign markets. In 1949, the city's annual porcelain production was only 270,000 dan, and the products could not be sold. In recent years, domestic and foreign sales have gradually opened up. This year, the planned output has reached 600,000 dan, but the supply still falls short of demand. In late October and early November this year, the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government successively convened porcelain professional conferences and porcelain raw material and fuel supply professional conferences in Jingdezhen City to conduct detailed research and deployment on the balance of production, supply, and sales, and coordination and cooperation issues after the increase in Jingdezhen porcelain production in 1955.

    景德镇瓷器产量不断增加
    江西省景德镇市计划在一九五五年生产八十万担瓷器，满足国内和国外市场的需要。一九四九年全市瓷器年产量只有二十七万担，产品还销不出去。近几年来国内和国外销路逐渐打开，今年计划产量已达六十万担，仍供不应求。江西省人民政府已于今年十月下旬到十一月上旬在景德镇市先后召开瓷器专业会议和瓷器原料、燃料供应专业会议，对景德镇瓷器一九五五年产量提高后的产、供、销平衡和配合协作等问题，作了详细的研究和部署。 （新华社）
