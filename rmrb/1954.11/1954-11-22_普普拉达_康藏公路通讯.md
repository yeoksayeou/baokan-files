    Pula Prada
    ——Communications on the Kang-Tibet Highway
    By our reporter Shen Shi
    The mountains echoed with the sound of copper bells, shouts, and mountain songs. A large pack train of mules and horses set off from Kormai in Sang’ngag Chubdzong, following the primitive paths towards the Angula construction site.

    The mule train stopped by the Kormai River. The Tibetan compatriots taking care of the livestock either walked back and forth on the riverbank's meadow, or anxiously looked at the wooden bridge washed away by the flood, or ran upstream, hoping to find a shallow spot where people and animals could wade across. The water flowed so rapidly, and the riverbed was full of rocks, making it impossible to wade. Just as everyone was worrying, a robust man wearing a tilted礼帽 (lǐmào, literally "ceremonial hat" but probably just a regular hat) on horseback sped over from the hillside behind. Everyone stared at him, and someone said, "Look! Pula Prada is here."

    Pula Prada was very familiar to everyone! When they were together, they always affectionately called him "Pula."

    Pula approached the group. Before he could dismount, everyone surrounded him, some raising their hands to greet him. A man named Buchu pointed to the site where the bridge had been washed away and said to him, "Pula! Look! The bridge is gone." Pula frowned and pondered for a while. He said to everyone, "If people and animals can't cross the river, it will be delayed for too long, and we won't be able to reach the construction site on time, and the transportation task won't be completed. The bridge has been destroyed, we must find a way. It's getting late, everyone should rest first, and we'll talk about it tomorrow!"

    A chorus of "Lasuo" (yes) was heard, and everyone dispersed, some unloading packs, some removing saddles, some setting up tents, and some gathering firewood. The sound of flowing water, the neighing of horses, the ringing of copper bells, the clamor of voices, and the crackling of burning firewood made the meadow lively.

    At this time, only Pula was walking back and forth by the river. He looked at the river water for a while, and at the bridge piers on the riverbank for a while. The water was flowing so fast, without a bridge, how could they cross the river? If they couldn't cross the river, would they have to stay here for a few more days? The project at the foot of Angula Mountain was urgent! If the rice wasn't delivered on time, would the road builders go hungry? He thought about these questions as he walked. He walked to the bridge pier and sat down. The afterglow of the setting sun shone on his dark face. He remembered when he was on the transportation line, Captain Dong of the People's Liberation Army had told him the story of the Red Army's Long March. The Red Army's Long March crossed the snowy mountains and grasslands, and eighteen warriors climbed over the iron chains on the Dadu River, defeating the Kuomintang bandit army's blockade. Could it be that we can't cross the Kormai River? Thinking of this, he suddenly stood up, took off his boots and clothes, grabbed the bridge piles just above the water surface with both hands, and jumped into the water. The water flowing down from the snow-capped mountains made him shiver. He endured the impact of the icy flood, shaking the wooden bridge piers and shaking the piles. His confidence increased, and he quickly jumped out of the water, put on his clothes and boots, returned to the tent, called everyone in the transportation team over, and said to them, "The road construction team is waiting for food, we shouldn't stay on the road for a day, we must find a way to cross. I just went down to the water, and the bridge piers and wooden piles are very solid. I want to rebuild the bridge, what do you think?"

    "Rebuild the bridge? We have few people, I'm afraid it won't work," someone said.

    "It doesn't matter if we have few people, we'll work from morning till night," Pula said.

    "We only have two axes, how can we cut down trees?"

    "We have to build the bridge even with two axes. If the axes are chipped, we'll grind them," Pula said.

    Everyone agreed. The next day, before dawn, Pula was awakened by the sound of voices outside the tent. He quickly got dressed, ate some tsampa, and followed everyone up the mountain. The stars were still twinkling, the moon was still to the west, and a burst of logging sounds came from the forest. The two axes swung non-stop. When the axes were chipped, they were sharpened on the rocks, and trees were felled one by one. Pula's palms blistered. Someone said, "Pula, take a break! Let us do it." "What do these blisters count for?" he replied with a smile while cutting down trees.

    When there was enough wood, it had to be carried down the mountain. At this time, even the people who stayed near the tent to boil tea came. There weren't enough ropes, so they took off their belts. The wood was carried one by one, and among those carrying the first piece of wood, walking at the front, was their transportation team leader – Pula.

    When the wood was carried to the river, it was not easy to put it across to the other side. They had never built a bridge before, and they lacked tools. But no matter what, the bridge had to be built. They tied one end of the wood with a rope, and placed the other end in a pit. People pulled the rope hard, and the wood stood up, falling towards the opposite bank. Unexpectedly, they released it too violently, and the wood rolled into the river. They quickly tightened the rope and dragged it to the riverbank. Some dragged it on the shore, and some jumped into the water to retrieve the wood.

    At this time, someone said, "When the wood falls, the rope should be tightened and released slowly, so it won't roll into the river." Pula immediately led everyone to do it this way, and the first piece of wood was erected. The Tibetan compatriots cheered. Then all the wood was erected, covered with mud and gravel, and the bridge was finally built. At dusk, Pula and his team drove the mules and horses across their newly built bridge and continued towards the Angula construction site.

    Who in the Sang’ngag Chubdzong transportation team does not respect Pula Prada? When the transportation team was first established, he went to various villages to promote it, calling on everyone to join the transportation team to support the construction of the Kang-Tibet Highway. Since he led the transportation team, he has been fair in handling affairs, and he pays the team members truthfully for the amount of work they do. Once, his own yak carried six steel drills. Someone said, "Pula! Is your yak carrying too much?" He said, "If the load on my yak is reduced, won't it have to be distributed to other people's livestock?"

    On the thousands of miles of transportation line, Tibetan compatriots, men and women, led yaks, mules and horses, transporting materials to various construction sites, and they took care of the materials meticulously. When it rained, they took off their clothes and covered the grain. When camping, they put the grain in the center of the tent and slept beside it. If the tent was too small, their feet often extended into the open air. If the sacks were broken and they didn't bring twine, they pulled out horsehair and used it as twine. When Pula Prada's transportation team carried grain to Wada, Pula saw a pile of rice scattered on the road. He thought it must be because someone's sack was broken. He hurried forward and stopped the livestock temporarily. He checked the sacks one by one, looking at more than a hundred sacks, and found that the livestock of Tibetan compatriot Yousang had worn through the sack. He quickly sewed up the sack and then said to Yousang:

   "The sack is broken and the rice is leaking out, didn't you see it?" Yousang lowered his head and didn't say anything. Pula continued, "Rice doesn't come easily, you should check whether the sacks are broken before you leave, and you must also pay attention to it on the road!" Yousang quickly turned back and picked up the rice.

    When Pula Prada's transportation team was stationed by Angtso Lake, one evening, Captain Dong came to find Pula and said to him, "The grain supply for the road construction ahead is not keeping up, I hope your transportation team can make a few trips." Pula agreed. It was winter, the road surface was frozen, and Angtso Lake was also covered with ice. The construction section could not be passed during the day to avoid affecting construction. Night transport passed over Angtso Lake, which was a shortcut. Pula discussed the task given to him by Captain Dong with the team members. They said, "Will the livestock fall into the ice caves when passing through Angtso Lake at night?"

   "Who can guarantee that? If we don't transport grain, the people building the road ahead will go hungry. Which is more important, our livestock or road construction?" Pula said.

    The team members listened and were willing to participate in the night rush transport. At night, Pula's transportation team set off for the construction site with grain. They carefully let the livestock pass over Angtso Lake, and transported the grain to the construction site in time.

    When the highway reached Angtso Lake at the foot of Angula Mountain, Pula and his team members saw cars for the first time, and for the first time bought their favorite necessities at the mobile sales station established by the trading company. When the transportation task was successfully completed, when they returned to Sang’ngag Chubdzong, they brought back to their hometown people the new things they had seen along the highway, the banners they had won, and the moving stories from the transportation line.

    普普拉达
    ——康藏公路通讯
    本报记者  沈石
    山间里响着铜铃声，吆喝声，山歌声。一大队骡马，从桑昂曲宗的科麦出发，循着原始的小路，向安鸠拉工地前进。
    骡帮到了科麦河边，停了下来，照顾牲口的藏胞们，有的在河岸的草滩上来回地走动，有的焦急地望着那被洪水冲走的木桥，有的跑到河的上游，希望能够找到一处水浅的地方，让人马涉水过去。水流得那么急，河底尽是乱石，涉水是不可能了。大伙正在发愁的时候，忽然一个身体魁梧的人，歪戴着礼帽，骑着一匹黑马，从后面山坡奔驰过来。大伙都睁起眼睛瞧着他，有人在说：“看！普普拉达来了。”
    普普拉达，大伙对他可熟悉哩！在一起的时候，总是亲昵地叫他“普普”。
    普普走近大伙跟前，还没来得及下马，大伙一齐围过来，有的举起双手，向他招呼。一个名叫布楚的，指着那被水冲走的桥位，对他说：“普普！你看！桥没有了。”普普皱着眉头，沉思了一会。对大伙说：“人马不能过河，耽误久了，就不会按时赶到工地，运输任务也不能完成。桥冲毁了，一定得想办法，时候不早了，大家先歇下来，明天再说吧！”
    一阵“拉索”（是的）声，大伙分散开来，有的卸驮架，有的解马鞍，有的搭帐篷，有的拾柴火。水流声、马嘶声、铜铃声、嘈杂的人声、柴火燃烧时发出的噼拍声，草滩上顿时热闹起来。
    这时候，河边上只有普普在走来走去。他一忽儿看看河水，一忽儿望望那河边的桥墩。水流得这么急，没有桥，怎么过河呢？过不了河，难道在这里多待几天吗？安鸠拉山下的工程正紧哩！大米不按时运上，筑路的会不会挨饿呢？他边走边想这些问题。他走到桥墩边，坐下来。落日的余晖，映照在他黑黑的脸上。他想起过去在运输线上，解放军的董队长曾向他讲过红军长征的故事。红军长征走过了雪山草地，十八勇士爬过了大渡河上的铁索，打垮了国民党匪军的封锁。难道咱们就过不了科麦河吗？他想到这里，猛的站起来，脱去马靴和衣服，两手抓住刚露出水面的桥桩，跳下水去。从雪山上流下来的水冻得他发抖，他忍受着冰凉的洪水的冲击，摇摇木头桥墩，摇摇桥桩，他的信心增加了，赶忙跳出水面、穿好衣服、套上马靴，回到帐篷，把运输队里的人都叫过来，对他们说：“筑路队伍等着粮食，我们在路上一天也不应该停留，必须想办法渡过去，刚才我下到水里，那桥墩和木桩都很牢固，我想要重新架桥，你们觉得怎样？”
    “架桥吗？我们人少，恐怕不行。”有人说。
    “人少没关系，我们从早干到晚好了。”普普说。
    “我们只有两把斧头，怎么砍树呢？”
    “两把斧头也得把桥架起来，斧头砍缺了口，将它磨一磨。”普普说。
    大伙都同意了。第二天，天还没亮，普普被帐篷外的人声吵醒了。他赶忙穿好衣服，吃些?粑，跟着大伙上了山。星星还眨着微光，月亮还偏在西边，森林里发出一阵阵的伐木声。两把斧头不停地挥动，斧头砍缺了口，在石块上磨得更加锋利，大树一棵棵地砍倒了。普普的手掌擦起了水泡。有人说：“普普，你歇一阵吧！让我们干好了。”“这点水泡，算得什么？”他边砍树边笑着回答他们。
    木料够用了，得抬下山去。这时候，连留在帐篷附近烧茶的人都来了。绳索不够啊，把腰带解下来。木料一根接着一根的抬起来，那些抬着第一根木料，走在最前面的人中，有他们的运输大队长——普普。
    木料抬到河边，要将它搭过对岸，并不是容易的事。他们从来没有架过桥，又缺少工具。但不管怎样，桥总得架好。他们用绳索缚住木料的一端，另一端搁在土坑里，人们用力地拉绳，木料竖起来了，朝河对岸倒过去。不料放的过猛，木料滚到河里，他们赶忙拉紧绳索，将它拖到河边，有的在岸上拖，有的跳下水去，才将木料捞上来。
    这时，有人说：“木料倒下去的时候，应当将绳索拉紧，缓缓地放，就不会滚下河了。”普普马上领导大伙按照这办法做，第一根木料搭成了。藏胞们都欢呼起来，接着所有的木料都搭好，上面铺着泥土和沙石，桥终于搭成了。黄昏的时候，普普和他的队员们，赶着骡马，跨过他们新架的桥，继续向安鸠拉工地前进。
    桑昂曲宗的运输队员们，谁不尊重普普拉达呢？在运输队刚成立时，他到各村宣传，号召大家参加运输队，支援康藏公路的建设。他领导运输队以来，办事公道，领到多少力资，照实地付给队员们。一次，他自己的牦牛，驮了六根钢钎，有人说：“普普！你的牦牛是不是驮的太重？”他说：“我的牦牛驮的东西减轻了，不是要分到别人的牲口上去吗？”
    在千里的运输线上，藏族同胞，男男女女，牵着牦牛、骡马，输送物资到各个工地，他们爱护物资无微不至。下雨了、将自己的衣服脱下来，盖在粮食上。宿营的时候，将粮食放在帐篷的中央，自己睡在旁边，帐篷太小，脚经常伸到露天地方。麻袋破了，没带麻线，他们将马尾拔下来，当作麻线。普普拉达的运输队驮粮食到瓦达的时候，普普看到路上撒了一堆米，他想一定是谁的麻袋破了。他赶到前面，叫牲口暂时停下来，他将麻袋一袋一袋地检查，看了一百多袋，发现藏胞友桑的牲口将麻袋磨破了，他赶忙将麻袋缝好，然后对友桑说：
  “麻袋破了，大米漏出来，你难道没有看见吗？”友桑低着头，没啃声，普普接着说：“大米来得不容易，你应当在动身以前，看看麻袋是不是有破了的，在路上也得随时关心哩！”友桑赶忙地转回去，将大米拾起来。
    普普拉达的运输队驻在安错湖边的时候，一个晚上，董队长来找普普，对他说：“前面筑路的粮食供应不上，希望你们的运输队跑几趟。”普普答应了。那是冬天，路面结了冰，安错湖也被冰层罩住了。施工地段白天不能通行，以免影响施工，黑夜运输打从安错湖上经过，是一条近路，普普把董队长交给的任务和队员们商量，他们说：“晚上经过安错湖，牲口会不会掉进冰窟里？”
   “谁能担保呢？假若我们不去运粮食，前面筑路的人就要挨饿，我们的牲口重要呢，还是筑路重要呢？”普普说。
    队员们听了，都愿意参加黑夜抢运，夜里，普普的运输队驮着粮食向工地出发了，他们小心地让牲口从安错湖上通过，将粮食及时地运到了工地。
    公路通到安鸠拉山下的安错湖边，普普和他的队员们，在这里，第一次见到了汽车，第一次在贸易公司设立的流动推销站买得了心爱的必需品，当运输任务胜利完成，他们回到桑昂曲宗的时候，他们带给故乡人民的，是公路沿线所见到的新事物，是他们所赢得的锦旗和在运输线上的动人事迹。
