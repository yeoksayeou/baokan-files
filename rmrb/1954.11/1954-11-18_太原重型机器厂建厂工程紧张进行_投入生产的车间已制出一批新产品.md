Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, November 17th: The construction of the new Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant is proceeding intensely. The steel structure roof truss of the extended section of the First Forging Workshop has been installed, and civil construction workers are building walls and laying roof panels. The foundation engineering of the approximately 40-meter-high heating furnace chimney in this workshop is also underway. Workers at the welding workshop construction site are pouring cement after tying the ring beams. The wall building and roof panel laying of this workshop will be carried out this winter using methods of delaying freezing and steam curing. At another construction site, earth-moving machines are removing topsoil and spreading sawdust to prevent ground freezing. They will dig the foundation for the woodworking workshop, which will be started early next year, this winter. The workers are determined to complete these construction tasks this winter to welcome even larger-scale construction tasks next year.

In past construction, the workers building the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant have already built more than 22,000 square meters of factory buildings, warehouses, and more than 9,700 square meters of roof trusses. The Second Machining and Assembly Workshop, the First Forging Workshop, and the temporary Foundry and Sheet Metal Workshop, which have been initially completed and partially built, have been put into production.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, November 17th: The Second Machining and Assembly, First Forging, and temporary Foundry and Sheet Metal workshops of the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant, which have been initially completed, have trial-produced a batch of new products since being put into production. This year, these workshops have already manufactured seven sets of equipment for the coking and chemical aspects of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company; other equipment is being assembled and prepared for trial production.

These workshops have been put into production successively since their initial completion in early 1952. In addition to undertaking the construction tasks of the plant's own steel structure, they have also undertaken the manufacture of coking and chemical equipment, 50-ton cranes, electric furnaces, blast furnace hoppers, gas generators, jib cranes, and D-shaped axles for trains, heavy machinery equipment and a number of large parts that could not be manufactured in the past or could only be manufactured by a few factories in our country, vigorously supporting the construction of more than ten enterprises such as Anshan, Taiyuan, Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plants, and the newly built Taiyuan No. 1 Power Plant and Jingwei Textile Machinery Manufacturing Plant.

With the progress of construction and installation engineering, the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant will further play its role in manufacturing heavy machinery. Next year, this plant will undertake three times the production tasks of this year and will manufacture in batches the gas generators and other heavy equipment that have already been successfully trial-produced this year.

    太原重型机器厂建厂工程紧张进行
    投入生产的车间已制出一批新产品
    【新华社太原十七日电】新建太原重型机器厂正在紧张施工。第一锻压车间的接长部分的钢结构屋架已经装好，土木建筑工人正砌墙和盖屋面板。这个车间内约四十公尺高的加热炉烟囱也在进行基础工程施工。焊接车间工地上的工人们扎好围梁后，正在浇注水泥。这个车间的砌墙和盖屋面板工程将在今冬以延缓冻结和蒸气养护的方法来进行施工。在另一工地上，铲土机正在铲趟表土和撒木屑，以防地冻。他们将在今冬挖好明年初就要兴工的木工车间地基。工人们决心要在今冬完成这些建筑任务，以迎接明年更大规模的施工任务。
    建筑太原重型机器厂的工人们，在过去施工中，已经建成两万二千多平方公尺的厂房、仓库和九千七百多平方公尺的屋架。已初步建成和部分建成的第二机工装配车间、第一锻压车间、临时铸工冷作车间等已投入生产。
    【新华社太原十七日电】太原重型机器厂初步建成的第二机工装配、第一锻压、临时铸工冷作等车间，投入生产以来试制了一批新产品。这些车间今年已经为鞍山钢铁公司制成七套焦炉化工方面用的设备；还有其他一些设备，正在进行装配和准备试制。
    这些车间从一九五二年初步建成后就陆续投入了生产。它们除担负了本厂厂房钢结构的建造任务外，并承制了我国过去不能制造或只有少数厂可以制造的焦炉化工方面用的设备、五十吨行车、电炉、高炉料斗、煤气发生炉、转臂吊车和火车用的D形轴等重型机械设备和若干大型配件，有力地支援了鞍山、太原、石景山等钢铁厂和新建太原第一发电厂、经纬纺织机械制造厂等十多个企业的建设。
    太原重型机器厂随着建筑和安装工程的进展，将进一步发挥制造重型机器的作用。明年这个厂将担负三倍于今年的生产任务。并将成批地制造今年已试制成功的煤气发生炉等重型设备。
