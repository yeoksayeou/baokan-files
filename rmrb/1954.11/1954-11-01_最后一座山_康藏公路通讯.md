　　The Last Mountain
　　——Communication from the Kangzang Highway
　　By Our Reporter　Shen Shi
　　The Sejila Mountain peak towers high in the clouds. At the foot of the mountain, the trees are lush and green, snow often flies on the mountain, the accumulated water in the stream valleys is covered with a thin layer of ice, and the deciduous trees are draped in scarlet autumn attire.
　　To the west of the mountain, advancing along the tributary of the Yarlung Tsangpo River—the Nyang River—passing through Tai Zhao, crossing the Minla Mountain at an altitude of over 4,000 meters, one reaches the Lhasa River Valley. To the east, the long Kangzang Highway has already been built to Lulang at the foot of the mountain. The highway must cross this great mountain, over 4,400 meters above sea level, and connect with the western section of the highway at the Ba River, east of Tai Zhao.
　　This is the last high mountain on the eastern section of the Kangzang Highway.
　　The last mountain is so attractive to the workers and soldiers, to the commanders and engineers responsible for building the road! Overcoming the last mountain, they will soon join forces with the road-building team in the western section, and the highway built on the "roof of the world" will be connected. For five years, how many high mountains have they climbed, how many high mountains have they conquered! Listen to the names of these mountains: Erlang Mountain, Zheduo Mountain, Que'er Mountain, Aila, Zongla, Gela, Jiapila, Damala, Nianla, Langla, Yela, Anjiula..., one by one, they have passed under their feet. Could the last mountain block the path of heroes?
　　Before the construction began, the footprints of surveyors and engineers had long been imprinted in the towering primeval forests on the mountain, on the moss-covered cliffs, and in the knee-deep mud marshes.
　　“Guarantee that the highway will be open to Lhasa by the end of this year," all road-building employees had solemnly reported to the people of the motherland and Chairman Mao. They all understood in their hearts that to fulfill their promise, they had to eliminate the obstacles on the road ahead in advance. And now, the main obstacle remaining on the entire line is this last mountain—Sejila.
　　On the high mountains above the snow line, when winter comes, the soil freezes like solid stone. The highway must pass through the top of the mountain before the soil freezes. This arduous task is undertaken by a certain division of the People's Liberation Army and thousands of workers.
　　In mid-September, the project to open up the last mountain began. The sound of blasting, the sound of hammering steel drills, the sound of electric saws felling trees, and the loud noise of cliffs and rocks rolling down the valleys were mixed with the sound of the vast pine waves, forming a symphony of the great forest. Everyone knows that this melody rippling in the deep mountains and valleys is also the march forward song for the construction of the Tibetan Plateau.
　　White tents, layer upon layer, are dotted among the pine forests along the slope of the mountain. Wisps of smoke, passing through the treetops, condensed into long sky-blue belts. Walking into the barracks of an engineering battalion, the corridors, arches, clubs, and surroundings of the dormitories are all woven from pine branches. People can imagine how the soldiers can adapt to nature and conquer nature at the same time.
　　Don’t think that the slope where the tents are set up is not as high as Jingshan in the capital. An average person has to take a few steps, rest for a while, and pant for breath to climb up that slope. However, the road-building workers and soldiers all climb up the high mountains carrying tents, food, tools, and luggage. When they arrive at the construction site, they have to go up and down slopes every day, hammering steel drills, and carrying earth and rocks. They said, “This kind of life has long been accustomed to.” But what does it take to get used to climbing mountains with heavy loads and building roads on the plateau? That is what they are proud of, they have the perseverance and determination to build the Kangzang, it is because they have armed themselves that they can cross the high mountains and pave the road close to Lhasa.
　　One day, I went to the 14th team of the workers’ detachment, and instructor Ye Chunsheng accompanied me to visit the construction site. As we walked and talked, I pointed to the newly built road and asked him, "Was there no road here before?"
　　“Where is there a road! If you had come here half a month ago, you wouldn’t have found a road from the foot of the mountain to the top,” he answered, drawing out his voice quite a bit.
　　Without roads, the workers and soldiers used their own hands to carve out a road in a short period of time. If a big tree blocks the road, chop it down; if a cliff blocks the road, blow it up. If a mud marsh blocks the road, dig a trench, fill it with tree trunks and rubble; in companies lacking shovels and steel picks, they sometimes find ways to replace them with wood. With determination and perseverance, no matter how high the mountain is, a road can be opened up.
　　The veteran soldiers of the 9th company of a certain regiment are known for quarrying stone. They are the heroes who opened up Erlang Mountain. At that time, instructor Meng Qingyao was also in this company.
　　We sat around the stove, listening to Meng Qingyao narrate the road-building process. He slowly talked about the journey from the first mountain to the last mountain, from the soldiers not knowing how to build roads to how they learned to build roads.
　　At that time, they first stepped into the gate of the Kangzang Plateau and built roads on Erlang Mountain. On the plateau, cooks could not cook rice well. The soldiers did not know how to lay the road surface, how to build culverts and revetments. The ditches they dug were either too wide or too narrow. After the arduous projects of Que'er Mountain, Aila, Jiapila, the west bank of the Nujiang River, etc., everyone understood how to build roads, how to improve the progress of quarrying, and the cooks, even on the harsh snow line, could think of ways to stir-fry white and tender bean sprouts.
　　Finally, Meng Qingyao said modestly: "These are our experiences. It's nothing. However, with the highway, the changes are great." Indeed, whether in the road-building troops or on the plateau, as long as you pay a little attention to the surrounding things, you can always see that it is changing every day! In terms of time, it has been almost five years. In terms of the road-building team, new people have gradually grown up. In terms of the long highway line, it is advancing westward day by day, has crossed the top of the last mountain, and the songs of labor can be heard on the banks of the Nyang River.
　　“With the highway, the changes are great," Meng Qingyao's words reminded me of the scene when I first entered the Kangzang Plateau in 1951. At that time, the highway was only built to Que'er Mountain, and the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province had just been established. But today, I am standing on the last mountain peak on the highway line, overlooking the towering Daxue Mountain in the southeast corner. I think of the winding highway that is advancing westward, crossing high mountains and rapids, and is about to approach Lhasa.
　　I also thought of a tea shed next to the highway on the mountainside, which was set up by the workers to entertain the brother troops passing by. The tea shed is filled with cigarettes, tea, and candy. There are also some newspapers and magazines. I browsed through the newspapers and found several copies of the People's Daily, one of which had a large headline and published the news of the Dalai Lama's arrival in the capital. I calculated the time. It took only about 20 days for this newspaper to come from the capital to this remote place. However, in the era when the highway was not built, it took people more than three months to ride a horse from Ganzi in Xikang to Lhasa. If there was heavy snow blocking the mountains, sometimes they could not pass at all. Today, in this place far away from Beijing, newspapers there can be seen in more than 20 days. This is a change! When the Dalai Lama went to Beijing from Lhasa and passed by the banks of the Nyang River, there was no road on this high mountain, and in the short time that he arrived in the capital, cars were already driving on Sejila.

    最后一座山
    ——康藏公路通讯 　本报记者　沈石
    色齐拉山峰高高地耸立在云层里。山脚下，林木青葱，山上经常飞着雪花，溪谷的积水浮起一层薄冰，落叶树披起了绯红的秋装。
    山的西边，沿着雅鲁藏布江的支流——尼洋河——前进，经过太昭，越过拔海四千多公尺的敏拉山，达到拉萨河谷。东边，漫长的康藏公路，已经修筑到山麓的鲁朗。公路必须翻过这座拔海四千四百多公尺的大山，在太昭以东的巴河和西段的公路啣接起来。
    这是康藏公路东段的最后一座高山。
    最后一座山，对于工人和战士，对于负责修路的指挥员和工程师，是多么富有吸引力啊！越过最后一座山，眼看就要和西段的筑路队伍会师了，修建在“世界屋脊”的公路就要贯通起来了。五个年头，他们爬过多少高山，征服过多少高山！听听这些山的名称吧：二郎山、折多山、雀儿山、矮拉、宗拉、格拉、加皮拉、达马拉、年拉、郎拉、业拉、安鸠拉……，在他们的脚下，一座一座的过去了，难道最后一座山，能够挡住英雄的路吗？
    动工以前，在山上遮天蔽日的原始森林里，长满苔藓的崖石上，水深及膝的泥沼里，早就踏上了测量工人和工程师的脚印。
      “保证今年年底将公路通到拉萨”，全体筑路员工曾经向祖国人民和毛主席作过这样庄严的报告，他们心底里都明白，要实践自己的诺言，就得事先排除前进路上的障碍。而现在，全线剩下的主要的障碍，就是这座最后的山——色齐拉。
    雪线上的高山，当冬天降临的时候，泥土冻结得像坚石一样，必须在冻土以前，将公路通过山顶；这一艰巨的任务，由人民解放军某师和数千工人承担起来。
    九月中旬，打通最后一座山的工程开始了，爆破声、锤打钢钎声、电锯伐木声、崖石滚下山谷发出的巨响，夹杂着万顷松涛声，凑成了大森林的交响曲。谁都知道，这荡漾在深山峡谷中的旋律，也就是建设西藏高原的前进曲。
    白色的帐篷，一层一层地，顺着山的坡度，点缀在松林间。缕缕炊烟，透过树梢，凝成了天蓝色的长带；走进工兵某营的营房，那回廊、拱门、俱乐部和宿舍的四围，都是用松枝编成的，人们可以想像到，战士们是这样会适应大自然，同时是这样会征服大自然。
    不要以为那架设帐篷的斜坡还没有首都的景山那么高。一般人爬上那斜坡，就得走几步，歇一阵，喘喘气，然而筑路的工人和战士，都是背着帐篷、粮食、工具和行李爬上高山的。他们到了工地，每天都得上坡下坡，都得锤打钢钎，搬运土石。他们说：“这种生活，早已习惯了。”可是习惯于负重爬山，习惯于高原上筑路，需要什么呢？那就是他们足以自豪的，他们有着坚忍的毅力和建设康藏的决心，就是因为他们武装了自己，才能越过重重高山，将公路铺近拉萨。
    一天，我到了工人支队十四中队，指导员叶春生伴着我去访问工地。我们边走边谈，我指着那刚修好的路问他：“这地方原先没有路吗？”
    “那里有路！假若你在半个月以前来到这里，你从山脚走到山顶，也找不出路来的，”他答话时，声音拖得相当长。
    没有路，工人和战士，用自己的手，在短短的时间内，开出一条路来。大树挡住了路，砍掉它；崖石挡住了路，炸掉它。泥沼挡住了路，挖出一条沟槽，用树干和块石填平它；在缺少铁锹、钢镐的连队里，有时他们想办法用木料来代替。有了决心和毅力，山再高些，也会开辟出路来的。
    某团九连的老战士们，是以开凿石方著称的。他们是打通二郎山的好汉。那时候，指导员孟庆尧也在这个连队里。
    我们围着火炉，倾听孟庆尧叙述筑路的经过。他慢吞吞地从第一座山说到最后一座山，从战士们不会筑路说到怎样学会筑路。
    那时候，他们初次踏进康藏高原的大门，在二郎山修路。在高原上，炊事员煮不熟饭。战士们不会铺路面，不会砌涵洞和护坡。挖水沟，不是太宽，就是太窄。经过雀儿山、矮拉、加皮拉、怒江西岸等艰巨工程，大家懂得了怎样筑路，懂得了怎样提高开凿石方的进度，而炊事员，即使在严寒的雪线上，也能想出办法，炒出又白又嫩的豆芽来。
    末了，孟庆尧谦虚地说：“这些就是我们的经历。这算不得什么。不过，有了公路，变化是大的。”的确，不管在筑路部队里，或者在高原上，只要稍稍留心周围的事物，总可以看到它每天每天都在变化啊！论时间，将近五年了。论筑路队伍，新人逐渐成长起来了。论漫长的公路线，它一天天地向西前进，已经越过最后一座山的山顶，在尼洋河边，可以听到劳动的歌声了。
    “有了公路变化是大的”孟庆尧的话，使我回想起一九五一年第一次进入康藏高原的情景，那时候，公路还只修到雀儿山，西康省藏族自治区还刚刚成立。而今天，我却站在公路线上的最后一座山峰，眺望那东南角上高耸入云的大霂山，我想到那蜿蜒西进的公路，它越过高山急流，快要接近拉萨了。
    我又想起山腰里公路旁边的一座茶棚，这是工人们为招待过路的兄弟部队而设的。茶棚里摆着纸烟、茶水和糖果。还有一些报刊和杂志。我翻阅那些报刊，找到几份人民日报，其中有一张用大号字标题、登载着达赖喇嘛抵达首都的新闻，我计算了一下时间，这份报纸从首都来到这遥远的地方，只有二十来天，但是在公路没有修筑的年代，人们从西康的甘孜骑马到拉萨，需要三个多月，碰到大雪封山，有时还不能通行。今天，在这远离北京的地方，二十多天内，可以看到那里的报纸了，这算是个变化啊！当达赖喇嘛从拉萨赴北京，经过尼洋河畔的时候，这座高山还没有路，而他到达首都短短的时日里，汽车已在色齐拉行驶了。
