Fujian’s coastal area public security organs, after careful investigation, have successively cracked nine espionage cases dispatched by American and Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agent organs. Twenty-six principals and accomplices, including Zeng Guozhu, were captured, and many pieces of incriminating evidence such as weapons, forged documents, secret intelligence, and potions were seized. These cases have been concluded by the Fujian Provincial People's Court, and death sentences or prison terms have been imposed according to the severity of each criminal's circumstances. This is a great victory for the people of Fujian in cooperating with the struggle to liberate Taiwan.

Among these nine American-Chiang Kai-shek espionage cases, one was cracked in Xiamen, with criminals led by Zeng Guozhu and Wu Quancheng. Since 1950, these two criminals have repeatedly written letters and sent people to Hong Kong to contact American and Chiang Kai-shek special agent organs, reporting on the military, political, and economic situation in Xiamen, and printed reactionary appointment orders, colluding with soldier-thugs Liang Shaorong, and rogue Lin Yongshun, to expand the counter-revolutionary organization. In September 1953, Zeng and Wu accepted the reactionary titles of Director and Staff Officer of the Chiang Kai-shek stationed Xiamen intelligence team respectively, and recruited henchmen such as Li Shuizhi, Lü Shuisheng, and Guo Nanshan, to collect information on the type of troop, serial number, quantity, firepower configuration, and fortification of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xiamen, and reported it to the American and Chiang Kai-shek special agent organs in Hong Kong. At the same time, the two criminals also attempted to disintegrate the militia forces in Heshan and Xuecuo townships of Xiamen, and distributed a large number of reactionary leaflets in Zhongshan Park, Xiamen, spreading rumors to confuse the public. At the end of 1953, when a certain construction project on the Fujian coast entered a stage of intense construction, these criminals thought the time had come, and immediately sent people to the special agent organs in Hong Kong to request potent anesthetics and poisons, plotting to infiltrate the construction site as cooks to poison our senior engineering personnel. After that, Zeng and Wu not only requested radio stations, small cameras, drawing instruments, and double-bottom suitcases from Hong Kong, but also established direct contact with the leading organs of Chiang Kai-shek special agents in Taiwan to expand their counter-revolutionary activities.

Another case is the case of Pan Dehua, a special agent dispatched to Zhangzhou by the Chiang Kai-shek "Confidential Bureau Hong Kong Special Group." The criminal Pan used the alias Fu Zefu. In January 1953, he officially joined the special agent organization, received special agent training in Taiwan, learned methods of sabotage such as blasting and assassination, as well as communication methods, and received personal instructions from Chiang Kai-shek special agent chief Mao Renfeng. From Taiwan via Hong Kong Pan sneaked into Zhangzhou and Xiamen to carry out activities. Pan mixed into our private night school in Zhangzhou as a volunteer teacher, and used teaching social dancing as a guise to enter and exit our government agencies and people's organizations, probing for our political and economic intelligence, and actively cultivating relationships, specifically probing for our military secrets. Pan sent multiple intelligence reports to special agent organs in Hong Kong using coded messages and secret writing, and received commendation letters from Mao Renfeng. After that, Pan actively engaged in activities among returned overseas Chinese to develop reactionary organizations. In February of this year, according to instructions from Chiang Kai-shek's "Confidential Bureau," Pan tried every means to establish a hidden radio station,妄想 to continue sabotaging our national defense and economic construction.

Another case is the espionage case led by criminal Wang Qiongyao, dispatched by Chiang Kai-shek's "Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Interior, Hong Kong South China Office." Criminal Wang sneaked into Xiamen from Hong Kong in March 1953, and successively introduced his concubine, criminal Xue Shuzhen, and his former wife's brother-in-law, criminal Huang Guozhong, into the special agent organization, appointing them as "strategic stronghold intelligence officers." He also used the Minhua Clinic opened by Wang's mother, Lin Sufang, in Haicang Town, Haicheng County, as cover to contact special agent organs in Hong Kong. This group of special agent bandits used the pretext of writing letters for military families in the Heshan district of Xiamen to probe the type of troop, serial number, and movements of our People's Liberation Army. They also feigned enthusiasm, infiltrated our grassroots government, collected our political intelligence, and spread rumors. Criminal Wang Qiongyao secretly wrote twelve intelligence reports and sent them to special agent organs in Hong Kong.

There is also a case involving the Chiang Kai-shek "Fujian Guerrilla Headquarters驻乌丘工作组 stationed in Wuqiu Task Force" which conducted espionage activities in coastal areas such as Fuqing, Pingtan, Hanjiang, Putian, Jiangkou, and Shicheng. Since 1953, the principals and accomplices Lin Toujiu, Wu Yupan, Lin Wentong, Lin Jiuzi and others have traveled back and forth between the mainland and Wuqiu Island three times, reporting to the Chiang Kai-shek army on the quantity and location of our warehouses along the coast of Fuqing, guard posts, traffic arteries, and the berthing of our ships. At the end of September 1953, they robbed one of our fishing boats on the sea, capturing seven fishermen and stealing a large quantity of fish. They also attempted to destroy important bridges on the Minnan Highway with powerful explosives. When this group of criminals was arrested, incriminating evidence such as transportation passes and bullet cartridges were seized.

In addition, the "Minnan Area Mainland Enemy Rear Area Work Training Class Task Force" directly commanded by the American special agent organs was also cracked, and the "Longxi Anti-Communist Work Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party" belonging to the Chiang Kai-shek special agent organs "Central Bureau of Statistics" and the "Ninth Column of the Minnan Area" belonging to the Chiang Kai-shek Ministry of National Defense" were also cracked. Hidden special agents Lin Maosheng, Hong Weichuan, Huang Guoging, Peng Cong, Li Kaize, Zhuang Zonghua, Zhuang Zongde, Huang Gangsheng, Chen Ganquan, etc. were captured. These criminals who betrayed the motherland and harmed the people were mostly professional special agents, puppet military officers, soldier-thugs, and rogues who have consistently committed evil deeds and adhered to counter-revolutionary stances. For example, professional special agent Li Kaize joined the "Central Unification" in 1941 and persecuted democrats several times. In 1946, he also led the demolition of the Chongqing "Xinhua Daily" office. After liberation, Li continued to be incorrigible, actively engaged in reactionary organizations, appointed himself as the director of the Chiang Kai-shek "Longxi Anti-Communist Work Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party," and took the initiative to contact Chiang Kai-shek special agent chief Chen Lifu in Hong Kong,妄想 to realize the restoration plot. Hidden special agent Huang Guoging is a counter-revolutionary element with bloody debts, who murdered the masses Hu Sunming and others, destroyed three civilian houses, and was hated by the local masses.

Fujian faces Kinmen Island and Taiwan and is at the forefront of coastal defense. In order to consolidate national defense and ensure the safety of national construction and the lives and property of the people, the Fujian Provincial People's Court, in accordance with the Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries, sentenced the criminals Zeng Guozhu, Wu Quancheng, Liang Shaorong, Pan Dehua, Lin Maosheng, Wang Qiongyao, Hong Weichuan, Li Kaize, Huang Guoging, Lin Toujiu, Wu Yupan, Peng Cong and other twelve people to death, and sentenced Chen Minjiao, Zhuang Zonghua, Zhuang Zongde, Huang Gangsheng, Lin Yongshun, Lü Shuisheng, Li Shuizhi, Guo Nanshan, Xue Shuzhen, Lin Wentong, Huang Guozhong, Lin Sufang and other twelve criminals to imprisonment. Chen Ganquan and Lin Jiuzi were accomplices and did not commit great evils. Chen voluntarily surrendered himself and turned over incriminating evidence, so he was treated leniently and released after education. The Fujian Provincial People's Court also instructed the people's courts in Xiamen, Zhangzhou, Pingtan, Putian, Zhangpu and other places that cracked these counter-revolutionary activity cases to hold public sentencing rallies on the 4th, and enforce the law on the spot to educate the broad masses of the people, raise revolutionary vigilance, strengthen anti-espionage struggles, and severely suppress counter-revolutionary activities to fully support the liberation of Taiwan.

    福建人民公安机关破获九起美蒋特务案件
    主从犯中二十四名已被依法分别判处死刑和徒刑
    福建沿海地区人民公安机关经过周密的侦察，先后破获了美国和蒋贼特务机关派遣的特务案件九起。捕获主从犯曾国柱等二十六名，查获武器、伪造证件、密写情报、药剂等罪证多件。这些案件已经福建省人民法院审理结束，并已按各罪犯情节的轻重，依法判处死刑或徒刑。这是福建人民配合解放台湾斗争的一个巨大的胜利。
    这九件美蒋特务案件中，一件是在厦门破获，罪犯以曾国柱、吴泉成为首。这两个罪犯自一九五○年以来，已多次写信派专人去香港同美蒋特务机关联系，报告我厦门军事、政治、经济情况，并印制反动委任令，串同兵痞梁少荣、流氓林永顺，扩大反革命组织。一九五三年九月，曾、吴两犯分别接受蒋贼驻厦门情报组主任和参谋的反动头衔，又收罗了李水治、吕水生、郭南山等爪牙，多方搜集我人民解放军驻厦门部队的兵种、番号、数量、火力配备及工事设防等情况，报告给香港美蒋特务机关。同时两犯还妄图瓦解我厦门禾山、薛厝乡民兵武装，并在厦门中山公园散发大批反动传单，造谣惑众。一九五三年末，我福建沿海某建设工程进入紧张施工阶段时，这些罪犯以为时机已到，立即派人赴香港特务机关请领猛烈麻醉剂、毒药，阴谋潜入工地作厨师，毒害我高级工程人员。此后曾、吴两犯一面向香港请领无线电台、小型照相机、绘图仪器和双底皮箱等物，一面又同台湾蒋贼特务首脑机关取得直接联系，以扩大其反革命活动。
    另一件是蒋贼“保密局香港特别组”派遣到漳州的特务潘德华案。潘犯化名傅则夫。一九五三年一月正式加入特务组织，曾在台湾受了专门的特务训练，学习了爆破、暗杀等破坏活动方法及通讯联络办法，并接受蒋贼特务头子毛人凤亲自指示，由台湾经香港潜入漳州、厦门活动。潘犯在漳州混入我民办夜校担任义务教员，又以教交际舞为名，出入我政府机关、人民团体，多方刺探我政治、经济情报，并到处拉关系，专门刺探我军事机密。潘犯先后以明信暗语和密写向香港特务机关发出多次情报，受到毛匪人凤密函嘉奖。此后潘犯又积极在归国华侨中进行活动，发展反动组织。今年二月，潘犯更根据蒋贼“保密局”指示，千方百计设法建立潜伏电台，妄想继续破坏我国防建设和经济建设事业。
    又一件是以王犯琼瑶为首的蒋贼“内政部调查局香港华南办事处”派遣的特务案。王犯于一九五三年三月由香港潜入厦门，先后介绍他的姘妇薛犯淑珍及其前妻妻舅黄犯国忠加入特务组织，任“战略据点情报员”。又以王犯之母林素芳在海澄县海沧镇开设民华诊所为掩护，同香港特务机关联系。这伙特务匪徒在厦门禾山区以代替军属写信为手段，刺探我解放军兵种、番号和调动情况。他们还伪装积极，混入我基层政权，搜集我政治情报，散布谣言。王犯琼瑶曾先后密写情报十二份寄往香港特务机关。
    还有一案是在沿海福清、平潭、涵江、莆田、江口、石城等地进行特务活动的蒋贼“福建游击总部驻乌丘工作组”。自一九五三年以来，主从犯林头九、吴玉攀、林文通、林九吇等四人，三次往返大陆和乌丘屿，向蒋贼军报告我福清、沿海一带仓库的数量和位置、岗哨、交通要道及我船只停泊情况。并在一九五三年九月底，在海面抢劫我渔船一艘，捕去渔民七人，抢去大批渔货。他们还妄图以烈性炸药炸毁我闽南公路上的重要桥梁。这批罪犯被逮捕时缴获的有交通船证、卜壳枪子弹等罪证。
    此外，还破获了由美国特务机关直接指挥的“闽南地区大陆敌后工作训练班工作组”、破获了蒋贼特务机关“国民党中央统计局”所属的“中国国民党龙溪反共工作委员会”、蒋贼国防部所属的“闽南地区第九纵队”等特务组织，捕获潜伏特务林茂生、洪维传、黄国卿、彭聪、李开泽、庄宗华、庄宗德、黄港生、陈甘泉等。这些背叛祖国、危害人民的罪犯，大都是一贯为非作恶、坚持反革命立场的职业特务、伪军官、兵痞、流氓。如职业特务李开泽，一九四一年就参加了“中统”，几次迫害民主人士，一九四六年还领头捣毁重庆“新华日报”社。解放后李犯仍怙恶不悛，积极搞反动组织，自任蒋贼“中国国民党龙溪反共工作委员会”主任，主动去香港同蒋贼特务头子陈立夫联系，妄图实现复辟阴谋。潜伏特务黄国卿是一个血债累累的反革命分子，曾杀害群众胡孙明等二人，毁民房三所，当地群众恨之入骨。
    福建面对金门岛、台湾，是海防最前线。为了巩固国防，保证国家建设和人民生命财产安全，福建省人民法院特根据中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例，判处罪犯曾国柱、吴泉成、梁少荣、潘德华、林茂生、王琼瑶、洪维传、李开泽、黄国卿、林头九、吴玉攀、彭聪等十二名死刑，并分别判处陈敏娇、庄宗华、庄宗德、黄港生、林永顺、吕水生、李水治、郭南山、薛淑珍、林文通、黄国忠、林素芳等十二名罪犯徒刑。陈甘泉、林九吇是胁从分子，作恶不大，陈犯并曾主动投案自首，还交出了罪证，故从宽处理，经教育后释放。福建省人民法院同时指示破获这些反革命活动案件的厦门、漳州、平潭、莆田、漳浦等地人民法院于四日分别举行公开宣判大会，并当场执法，以教育广大人民群众，提高革命警惕，加强反特防奸斗争，严厉镇压反革命活动，全力支援解放台湾。
