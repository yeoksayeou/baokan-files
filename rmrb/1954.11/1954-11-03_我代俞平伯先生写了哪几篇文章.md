Now, the literary and art circles are engaged in a discussion of criticism of erroneous viewpoints in the research of "Dream of the Red Chamber." The purpose of this discussion is to eliminate the bourgeois standpoints, viewpoints, and research methods that remain in the minds of classical literature researchers. This is a debate of great significance.

Because many problems arising from using bourgeois standpoints, viewpoints, and methods to study "Dream of the Red Chamber" probably exist, to a greater or lesser extent, in many classical literature workers who study "Dream of the Red Chamber"—so this debate is of broad and significant significance, but is particularly severely manifested in many works of Mr. Yu Pingbo who studies "Dream of the Red Chamber."

In order to carry out this debate more thoroughly and better, I have a responsibility to explain a fact:

Among the articles recently published by Mr. Yu, four of them were written by me. These four are: 1. "The Ideological and Artistic Nature of Dream of the Red Chamber" (Northeast Literature, February 1954 issue); 2. "A Brief Introduction to Dream of the Red Chamber" (Dagong Daily, December 19, 1953); 3. "How We Read Dream of the Red Chamber" (Wenhui Daily, January 25, 1954); 4. "An Introduction and Commentary on Dream of the Red Chamber" (People's China, No. 10, 1954). The article "The Ideological and Artistic Nature of Dream of the Red Chamber" is the longest and was written first; "A Brief Introduction to Dream of the Red Chamber" is a condensed version of this long article and can be included within it; my opinions in the article "How We Read Dream of the Red Chamber" are few, and its structure and content were all pointed out by Mr. Yu. After it was written, it was revised by Mr. Yu; the draft of "An Introduction and Commentary on Dream of the Red Chamber" is "A Brief Introduction to Dream of the Red Chamber," and it was further revised by the editorial department of People's China.

The views in these articles, especially the article "The Ideological and Artistic Nature of Dream of the Red Chamber," are obviously different from Mr. Yu's other articles. Here, I will focus on explaining the writing and modification of this long article:

The writing process of this article is as follows: The editorial department of the foreign language publication People's China asked Mr. Yu to write an article introducing Dream of the Red Chamber to foreign readers. Mr. Yu wrote "A Brief Discussion on Dream of the Red Chamber," but later it was not suitable. Constructive opinions were given to Mr. Yu, and it was revised and published in the March issue of New Construction. Mr. Yu then asked me to write one for People's China. I had previously written a report on Dream of the Red Chamber, the content of which was roughly: to clarify that the thematic thought of Dream of the Red Chamber is to expose the corruption and exploitation of feudal society, and the crimes of oppressing the people; to explain that the cause of the tragic love between Baoyu and Daiyu is that feudal society does not allow free love and the existence of anti-feudal ideas, while Baochai's thoughts conform to the moral standards of feudal society.

I used the above content as the basis for writing this article (later, because the article was too long, it was transferred to Northeast Literature).

The modifications of this article are as follows:

Written by Mr. Yu himself:

(1) In the front of the article, when talking about Dream of the Red Chamber being banned in the past, the passage from "In the former feudal era, parents used 'obscenity' as an excuse..." to the end of this paragraph "are all examples of 'looking at the Wind and Moon Mirror from the front'" (see Northeast Literature, page 21) was added by Mr. Yu himself; the following paragraph immediately after, "Looking at the problem on the surface..." to the end of this paragraph "This can really be said to have been said by him" (see Northeast Literature, page 21) was significantly revised by Mr. Yu.

(2) In the back of the article, when talking about some of the shortcomings of Dream of the Red Chamber, the two paragraphs from "From the perspective of thought" to the end of the next paragraph "is related to the obscurity of the work itself" (see Northeast Literature, pages 32 and 33) were written by Mr. Yu himself because he felt that my original writing was inappropriate.

In my original manuscript, deleted by Mr. Yu:

(1) In the first half of the article, when talking about the extravagance of the Jia family, between saying "They also have a major source of income—exploiting the farmers who produce on their land" and the next paragraph "Let's look at their exploitation of tenant farmers" (see Northeast Literature, page 23), I originally wrote a paragraph:

"The political power of the feudal system is the political power of the landlord class, and the emperor is only the representative of the interests of the landlord class. The landlord's exploitation of farmers is regarded as a matter of course, because the economic foundation of the landlord class's political power is based on the exploitation of farmers. Farmers toil all year round, but they have to hand over more than half of their harvest to the landlord, leaving them with insufficient food and clothing; landlords do not engage in physical labor all year round, but they are able to eat rich food and wear fine clothes. This is unreasonable, but it is true in feudal society."

Immediately after saying that the money and grain handed over by the estate was so much that Jia Zhen still lost his temper, the conclusion is "If we don't ask you (tenant farmers), who should we ask," and between the next paragraph "Does the landlord class's exploitation of the poor people end here?" (see Northeast Literature, page 23), I originally had another paragraph:

"To what extent is this exploitation cruel? It is really hard to imagine without reading this description. In fact, Liu Gou'er, who still 'has not completed the winter preparations' in winter and brings his wife and children to Jia's mansion to 'beg for help,' and Granny Liu, who is coldly treated by the powerful servants and ridiculed by the masters, is not the shadow of the poor farmers in the countryside! We should not think that Granny Liu's visit to the Grand View Garden is Jia Mu's pity for the old and compassion for the poor, helping the poor; in fact, why are the farmers in the countryside poor? Isn't it because they are exploited by the landlords. They take away the clothes on their backs and the food in their mouths that they earned from their own labor, and then occasionally give them a little leftover food. Is this generosity! Granny Liu's visit to the Grand View Garden is ironic enough, but the target is not Granny Liu, but those parasitic members of the landlord class who are fed by the hard work of the farmers and then turn around and laugh at the ignorance, stupidity, and poverty of the farmers."

(2) In the back of the article, when talking about Gao E's continuation of the book, saying "This weakens the anti-feudal significance and role of Dream of the Red Chamber to some extent" (see Northeast Literature, page 33), I originally wrote a paragraph above this sentence:

"We say that Gao E's contribution in continuing the book is that not only did he make Dream of the Red Chamber a complete story, but also gave Dream of the Red Chamber a deeper layer of anti-feudal significance—exposing the lack of freedom of marriage in feudal society; but the two unacceptable thoughts in the continuation of the book—the thought of fame and the thought of wealth—offset this contribution a lot (of course, comparing the merits and demerits, the merits are still greater than the demerits). The trouble caused by these two kinds of thoughts not only divides Baoyu into two completely different people—from scolding people as 'rice worms' to going to 'win the local examination'; and also makes the Ning and Rong mansions, which have done all kinds of evil, 'good people cultivate good karma, evil people repent of their sins,' and 'the family fortunes are restored'."

In addition, there are some other changes in individual words and sentences and some corresponding changes made to the context due to large paragraphs being added and deleted, but because they are not as prominent, I will not mention them here.

Regarding the additions and revisions made by Mr. Yu himself, because the article is available, I will not say much now; I will only talk about the two places that Mr. Yu deleted—from these two deletions, we can see part of Mr. Yu's thoughts:

From the deletion of (1), we can see that Mr. Yu only acknowledges some of the phenomena of the Jia family's exploitation of farmers reflected in Dream of the Red Chamber, but believes that it is not necessary to mention the fact that "the political power of the feudal system is the political power of the landlord class," is unwilling to analyze the strong class contrast of "meat rots behind the vermilion gates, while frozen bodies lie on the road," and is unwilling to investigate the reasons for the ignorance and poverty of the farmers; that is, he is unwilling to further touch the essence of the problem—the essence of class opposition in feudal society, which is precisely what Dream of the Red Chamber mainly reflects and attacks.

The attitude of Mr. Yu reflects not only the problem of bourgeois thought, but also that in Mr. Yu's body, there are still remnants of feudal class thought, so he cannot completely draw a clear line with the feudal landlord class, is unwilling to give them the hatred they deserve, and is unwilling to analyze and expose the essence of their cruel exploitation. This is not an accidental thing. In "Dream of the Red Chamber Research," many evidences can be found that Mr. Yu sympathizes with the decline of the feudal landlord class and pities the end of the exploiters:

For example, when talking about the author of Dream of the Red Chamber and the theme of the book, he says:

Xueqin enjoyed the blessings of wealth, nobility, tenderness, and affection in his childhood, so he was able to create Dream of the Red Chamber. (page 145)

I think that what the author of Dream of the Red Chamber wants to say is nothing more than starting with glory and ending with haggardness, lamenting his life experience, reminiscing about past joys, and when the beautiful dreams are over, spending his life in poverty and sorrow. (page 147)

From prosperity to decline, from wealth to poverty, from exquisiteness to desolation, from arrogance to destitution, that is the dream, that is the illusion, that is the main purpose of this book. (page 147)

This not only distorts the anti-feudal realistic significance of Dream of the Red Chamber, but also shows that Mr. Yu still admires and regrets the "blessings of wealth, nobility, tenderness, and affection," "glory," "past joys," "beautiful dreams," "prosperity," "wealth," "exquisiteness," and "arrogance" written in the book.

For example, regarding the end of the Jia family, he says:

Not only the rise and fall of the Ning and Rong mansions, and the prosperity and decline of the twelve beauties, can make readers feel sad and shed tears. (page 122)

After the confiscation, the Jia family members were imprisoned, including Baoyu and Fengjie. At that time, the servants were scattered, but there were former maids who were expelled who still knew how to comfort their masters. The sadness of the text can be imagined. (page 221)

Writing about the desolation of Fengjie's death is writing about the plight of the Jia family, even the prosperous family of a hundred years cannot protect a daughter, but instead relies on an old woman in the countryside. What kind of emotion is this! (page 155)

This "servants are scattered, maids comfort their masters," "a century-old family cannot protect a daughter" shows how deep sympathy is given to the decline of the feudal class!

The reason why Mr. Yu is particularly dissatisfied with the last forty chapters also lies here. He said:

Later, the Jia family members seemed too cold-blooded towards Daiyu, especially Jia Mu. (page 60)

In the ninety-sixth chapter, "Hiding the News, Fengjie Devises a Strange Plan," from our point of view, why write the Jia family so sinister? (page 40)

Fengjie and Baochai are written too viciously. (page 68)

According to Mr. Yu, the Jia family members, Baochai and Fengjie, should not be so "cold-blooded" and "sinister." Should they be "enthusiastic" and "kind"!

Especially Fengjie, the typical representative of the feudal class—she lends money at high interest rates, makes friends with government officials, undertakes lawsuits, kills people, and is lewd, treacherous, and dangerous. Mr. Yu gives a lot of sympathy to her end:

Fengjie's ending is very tragic, which makes people sad. (page 215)

The iceberg on the album vividly depicts the scene of everyone pushing a falling wall. (page 160)

"Knowing Fate and Forcing a Hero" is a very good title, and there should also be a good article to write about the sadness of her end, so that people can shed tears. (page 216)

Therefore, what exists in Mr. Yu's mind is not only the bourgeois literary and artistic viewpoint; at the same time, it is also accompanied by the remaining feudal class thoughts and the feelings of the declining scholar-bureaucrat class. Therefore, he feels so sad and sympathetic to the failure of the Jia family and the end of Fengjie.

From the deletion of (2), we can see that Mr. Yu underestimates the value of the last forty chapters of Dream of the Red Chamber. This erroneous view is also pervasive throughout the entire "Dream of the Red Chamber Research." Almost no article in this book does not denigrate the last forty chapters. This shows that Mr. Yu does not look at this issue from the objective effect of the work itself on the broad masses of readers.

Due to Mr. Yu's erroneous bourgeois literary and artistic thoughts, Mr. Yu's understanding of Dream of the Red Chamber starts from the basic concept of "form is emptiness" (all phenomena will eventually be annihilated), thus producing many views that are true and false, positive and negative, without affirmation or denial; and because there are still many remnants of the declining feudalist thoughts in Mr. Yu's mind, Mr. Yu does not have strong hatred and denial of the feudal characters and feudal things in the book. The most prominent manifestation of these two erroneous thoughts is that Mr. Yu actually says that Baochai and Daiyu, two characters with completely incompatible personalities, were originally intended by the author to be "two beauties in one," and affirmed that Baochai and Daiyu had a good relationship after the eightieth chapter. Because Daiyu died early due to illness, Baoyu married Baochai, and Baochai still missed Daiyu after marriage; thus, he denigrates how bad the tragic love story of Baoyu and Daiyu in the last forty chapters is.

That's right, Mr. Yu's statement is based on "Zhi's annotations." However, first of all, Zhi's annotations cannot be fully believed. For example, in the first chapter, "Song of the Good," "Saying that the powder is thick and fragrant, how can the temples be frosted again?" Regarding "how can the temples be frosted again," Jiaxu's annotation is "Daiyu and Qingwen and others" (the original is not there, according to the copied version). Daiyu aside, Qingwen died in the seventy-eighth chapter. How could she live to "have frosted temples"? If we believe this annotation to infer the later books, shouldn't we say that Qingwen and Daiyu lived to be sixty or seventy years old? Therefore, it is unreliable to infer the events after the eightieth chapter entirely based on Zhi's annotations. In addition, the most important thing in speculating on the later ending of an unfinished book is that it should be based on the text of the existing book, and not abandon the text to use unreliable annotations. Looking at the first eighty chapters, Baochai is indeed a typical and faithful believer of feudalism, while Daiyu is a representative of a strong anti-feudal young woman. Two people with such different personalities have already shown many irreconcilable contradictions and conflicts in the first eighty chapters. How could they suddenly "turn hostility into friendship" after the eightieth chapter? This is unimaginable.

Mr. Yu, because he first had a subjective idealistic erroneous view of "two beauties in one" and cited "Zhi's annotations" as the basis for his argument; thus, he disregarded the contradictions and conflicts between the two fundamentally different characters, Baochai and Daiyu, written in the eighty chapters of Dream of the Red Chamber, and insisted that Baochai and Daiyu had a good relationship after the eightieth chapter, "two beauties in one," thus denigrating the "disagreement with the author's original intention" of the tragic love story of Baoyu and Daiyu in the last forty chapters.

Of course, the first eighty chapters were written by Cao Xueqin, and the last forty chapters were continued by others. This issue cannot be confused; but not confusing them does not mean negating the last forty chapters, does not mean disregarding the role that the last forty chapters have played in the broad masses of readers for more than a hundred years and writing off its value.

Since it was discovered that the last forty chapters of Dream of the Red Chamber were not originally written by Cao Xueqin, they have always been denigrated. These denigrations are all written on Gao E's account; and even more conversely, because of Gao E, the last forty chapters are denigrated—Gao E passed the imperial examinations and served as an imperial censor, and the last forty chapters unfortunately have the event of "Baoyu passing the imperial examination," so it is said that the entire last forty chapters of Dream of the Red Chamber (including the tragic love story of Baoyu and Daiyu) are unacceptable.

Of course, there is a close relationship between "person" and "text." But regarding this issue, I have a very immature new view recently: I think that most of the last forty chapters were not continued by Gao E, but were continued by others that Cheng Weiyuan bought. The reasons are some, which will be explained in another article.

I think that most of the last forty chapters were not written by Gao E, so we cannot despise the entire last forty chapters because Gao E passed the imperial examinations and served as an imperial censor; but the manuscripts bought for the last forty chapters were very messy and were organized by Gao E. In this organizing process, he may have added some things—corresponding to his thoughts of fame and wealth. These things were mixed with the purchased manuscripts, bringing burdens to the last forty chapters of Dream of the Red Chamber. I highly suspect that some of the words about Baoyu passing the imperial examination and the Jia family being restored are added by Gao E, because from the ninety-sixth chapter to the one hundred and seventeenth chapter, there is no writing about Baoyu going to school, nor is there any implication that Baoyu passed the imperial examination, and this large section is precisely the tense scene of a series of events in the tragic love story of Baoyu and Daiyu and the decline of Ning and Rong; before this, the words that imply Baoyu passing the imperial examination and after this, the words that directly write about Baoyu passing the imperial examination, such as entering the family school twice, explaining the meaning of warning against stubbornness, trying the writing, and winning the local examination, and the words in the one hundred and twentieth chapter saying that the Jia family was restored, I suspect were added by Gao E.

As for whether the continuator of the last forty chapters had seen some remaining drafts of Cao Xueqin's work after the eightieth chapter and continued to write based on these materials, I think this may also be the case. The last forty chapters make the characters and stories of Dream of the Red Chamber develop reasonably and naturally (except for Baoyu passing the imperial examination and the Jia family being restored), which may be based on some evidence.

The reason why I emphasize so much that most of the last forty chapters were not continued by Gao E is because:

The development of the story in the last forty chapters has been denigrated by Mr. Yu because it did not conform to Mr. Yu's subjective idealistic prejudice of "two beauties in one" and wrote the "tragic love story of Baoyu and Daiyu"; but Mr. Yu's denigration is at the same time as denigrating "Baoyu passing the imperial examination." Therefore, I specifically state here: Most of the last forty chapters, such as the tragic love story of Baoyu and Daiyu and the decline of Ning and Rong, were not written by Gao E, but were continued by others that Cheng Weiyuan bought; but Baoyu passing the imperial examination and the Jia family being restored may have been added by Gao E. Therefore, they cannot be confused and should be viewed separately. Baoyu passing the imperial examination is not good, but the tragic love story of Baoyu and Daiyu should not be negated at the same time as criticizing Baoyu passing the imperial examination.

If my immature view can still be established, then our attitude towards the last forty chapters should be: affirming the part written by the original continuator—the tragic love story of Baoyu and Daiyu, the decline of Ning and Rong; criticizing the part added by Gao E—Baoyu passing the imperial examination, the Jia family being restored; instead of writing off the last forty chapters in one stroke like Mr. Yu.

I made a mistake in writing articles on behalf of Mr. Yu, and Mr. Yu also made a mistake, which should be reviewed separately. Today, I reveal this matter in order to clarify the issue, so that readers know which articles were written by me, so as not to be confused in this discussion; and to tell the situation of Mr. Yu's revision of this article (of course, there were also many problems in my original article), from these deletions and revisions, we can also partially explain Mr. Yu's bourgeois literary and artistic thoughts in the research of Dream of the Red Chamber, so that this discussion can be carried out better.

### 我代俞平伯先生写了哪几篇文章

专栏：

    我代俞平伯先生写了哪几篇文章
    王佩璋
    现在，文艺界展开了对“红楼梦”研究中错误观点的批判的讨论。这一讨论的目的在于清除残存在古典文学研究工作者思想中的资产阶级的立场、观点和研究的方法。这是一个有重大意义的论争。
    因为用资产阶级的立场、观点和方法来研究红楼梦而产生的许多毛病，在许多研究红楼梦的古典文学工作者的身上恐怕都是或多或少的存在着的——所以这次争论是有着广泛而重大的意义的，但表现得尤其严重的是俞平伯先生的许多研究红楼梦的作品。
    为了这次论争更彻底更好地进行，我有责任来说明一件事实：
    在俞先生近时所发表的文章中，其中有四篇是由我执笔的。这四篇是：一、“红楼梦的思想性与艺术性”（东北文学一九五四年二月号）；二、
  “红楼梦简说”（一九五三年十二月十九日大公报）；三、“我们怎样读红楼梦”（一九五四年一月二十五日文汇报）；四、“红楼梦评介”（人民中国一九五四年第十期）。“红楼梦的思想性与艺术性”一文最长，作在最先；“红楼梦简说”是这篇长文压缩成的，可以包括在它以内；“我们怎样读红楼梦”一文我的意见很少，其结构内容都是俞先生指出的，写成后又经俞先生增删改定的；“红楼梦评介”的底稿就是“红楼梦简说”，又经人民中国编辑部增删修改的。
    这几篇文章，尤其是“红楼梦的思想性与艺术性”一文的观点显然与俞先生其他的文章是不同的，这里就着重的说明这一长文写作与改动的情形：
    这篇文章写作的过程是这样：外文刊物人民中国编辑部请俞先生写一篇向国外读者介绍红楼梦的文章，俞先生写成了“红楼梦简论”，后来因为不合用，并且向俞先生提了建设性的意见，改在新建设三月号发表。俞先生就叫我代写一篇给人民中国。我从前作过一篇关于红楼梦的报告，内容大致是：阐明红楼梦的主题思想为暴露封建主义社会的腐朽和剥削、压迫人民的罪恶；说明宝黛爱情悲剧的原因是封建社会不容自由恋爱，不容反封建思想的存在，而宝钗思想合乎封建社会的道德标准。
    我用上述内容作为基础写了这篇文章（后来因为文章太长，转给东北文学）。
    这篇文章删改的情形是这样：
    俞先生自己写的：
    （一）在文章前面谈到红楼梦过去被禁止阅读，那“在从前封建时代里，家长们以‘诲淫’为借口……”至这一段末“都在‘正照风月宝鉴’之例”（见东北文学第二一页）这一段是俞先生自己增写的；紧接着下面一段“表面看问题……”至这一段末“这真算被他说着了”（见东北文学第二一页）这一段是俞先生做了较大的改动的。
    （二）在文章后面谈到红楼梦的一些缺点，那“就思想方面看”至下一段末“与作品本身的隐晦是有关系的”（见东北文学第三二、三三页）这两段是俞先生认为我原写不妥，自己写的。
      我原稿上有，经俞先生删去了的：
      （一）在文章的前半，谈到贾家生活奢侈，说
  “他们另外有主要的经济来源——剥削在他们的土地上生产的农民”与下一段“我们来看他们对佃户的剥削吧”（见东北文学第二三页）之间本来我写了一段：
    “封建制度的政权就是地主阶级的政权，皇帝不过是地主阶级利益的代表。地主剥削农民是被视为天经地义的，因为地主阶级政权的经济基础就是建立在剥削农民上。农民终年劳苦，但是要把收成的一半以上交给地主，弄得衣食不周；地主终年四体不勤，可是能够衣锦食肉。这是不合理的，可是在封建社会中却是真的。”
    紧接着说庄子上交来的钱粮是那么多而贾珍还发脾气，结论是“不和你们（佃户）要找谁去”，与下一段“地主阶级对穷苦人民的剥削止于此么？”（见东北文学第二三页）之间我本来还有一段：
    “这种剥削是残酷到了什么程度呢，不看这段描写，实在是很难想像的。其实呢，到了冬天而还‘冬事未办’，拿老婆孩子煞气的刘狗儿，到贾府去‘打抽丰’被豪奴们冷淡、被主子们嘲笑的刘姥姥，不就是乡村贫苦农民的影子么！我们不要以为刘姥姥进大观园一回是贾母惜老怜贫，周济穷苦人；其实乡下农民为什么穷苦呢，还不是被地主剥削的。夺去了他们自己劳动换来的身上衣、口中食，然后又偶尔极个别的给他们一点残羹冷炙，这就是宽仁厚义么！刘姥姥游大观园一回是够讽刺的，但对象不是刘姥姥，而是那些被农民辛苦的劳动成果喂养大了而又反过来嘲笑农民的无知、愚陋、贫穷的地主阶级寄生虫们。”
    （二）在文章后面谈到高鹗续书一段说“这就在某些程度上削弱了红楼梦反封建的意义和作用”（见东北文学第三三页），这句上面我本来写了一段：
    “我们说，高鹗续书的功劳是不但使红楼梦成为一个完整的故事，而且使红楼梦有了更深一层的反封建的意义——暴露封建社会婚姻不自由；但是续书中的两点要不得的思想——功名思想，富贵思想，就把这功劳抵消了不少（当然功罪相较，还是功大罪小。），这两种思想的作祟，不但把宝玉截然分成两个人——由骂人‘禄蠹’变成自己去‘中乡魁’；并且使作恶多端的宁荣二府又‘善者修缘，恶者悔祸’，而‘家道复初’起来。”
    此外，其他个别字句的改动和为了大段增删而把上下文做了某些相应的更动的情形还有一些，但因为不像这么突出，这里不说了。
    关于俞先生自己增改的，因文章具在，现在不多说；我只来谈谈俞先生删去这两处——从这两处删削可以看出俞先生一部分思想：
    从删去（一），可以看出俞先生只承认红楼梦所反映出来的贾家剥削农民的一些现象，而对“封建制度的政权就是地主阶级的政权”这一事实认为不必提及，对当时“朱门酒肉臭，路有冻死骨”的强烈的阶级的对比不愿分析，对所以造成农民的无知、贫困的原因不愿追究；也就是不愿更进一步接触这问题的本质——封建社会阶级对立的本质，而这正是红楼梦所主要反映和出力抨击的。
    俞先生这种态度所反映的不只是资产阶级思想的问题，而是在俞先生身上，还有着封建阶级的思想残余，所以对于封建的地主阶级还不能完全划清界限，对他们不愿给以应给的憎恨，对于他们残酷剥削的本质不愿加以分析和暴露。这并不是一件偶然的事，在“红楼梦研究”中就可以找到许多俞先生同情封建地主阶级的没落，悲悯剥削者末路的证据：
    例如谈到红楼梦的作者和书的主题时说：
        雪芹幼年享尽富贵温柔的人间福分，所以才有红楼梦。（一四五页）
        我想红楼梦作者所要说的，无非始于荣华，终于憔悴，感慨身世，追缅古欢，绮梦既阑，穷愁毕世。（一四七页）
        由盛而衰，由富而贫，由绮腻而凄凉，由骄贵而潦倒，即是梦，即是幻，即是此书本旨。（一四七页）
    这不但歪曲了红楼梦反封建的现实意义，而且表示俞先生对书中所写的“富贵温柔的人间福分”、“荣华”、“古欢”、“绮梦”、“盛”、“富”、“绮腻”、“骄贵”还不胜羡慕和追惋。
    又如关于贾家末路说：
        不但宁荣两府之由盛而衰，十二钗之由荣而悴，能使读者为之怆然雪涕而已。（一二二页）
        抄没以后，贾氏诸人关进监牢，宝玉凤姐都在内。其时奴仆星散，却有昔年被逐之丫鬟犹知慰主，文情凄惋可想而知。（第二二一页）
    写凤姐身后底凄凉，是写贾氏末路底光景，甚至于赫赫扬扬百年鼎盛的大族，不能荫庇一女，反借助于乡村中的老妪。这类文情是何等的感慨！（一五五页）
    这“奴仆星散，丫鬟慰主”，“百年大族不能荫庇一女”是对封建阶级的没落寄与了如何深刻的同情！
    俞先生对后四十回特别不满的原因也在这里。他说：
        后来贾氏诸人对于黛玉，似太嫌冷酷了，尤以贾母为甚。（第六○页）
        第九十六回“瞒消息凤姐设奇谋”，以我们眼光看来，何必写得贾氏一家如此阴险？（第四○页）
        凤姐宝钗写得太毒。（第六八页）
    依俞先生看，贾氏诸人，宝钗凤姐不该这么“冷酷”和“阴险”，难道他们应该是“热情”和“善良”的么！
    尤其是凤姐，这封建阶级典型的代表——他放高利贷，接交官府，包揽词讼，杀害人命，淫乱奸险，俞先生对她的末路却寄与了不少的同情：
        凤姐结局很凄惨，令人悲感。（第二一五页）
        册子上一座冰山，是活画出墙倒众人推的光景。（第一六○页）
        “知命强英雄”很好的回目，也应该有很好的文章写出她末路的悲哀，所以令人洒泪也。（第二一六页）
    所以，存在在俞先生思想中的，不只是资产阶级的文艺观点而已；同时，还伴有残余的封建阶级思想和没落的士大夫阶级的感情。因之才会对贾家的破败、凤姐的末路这么悲感和同情。
    从删去（二），可以看出俞先生对红楼梦后四十回估价的不足。这种错误的看法也是贯串在整个“红楼梦研究”中的。这本书中几乎没有一篇文章不是对后四十回加以贬斥的。这说明俞先生没有从作品本身在广大读者中所起的客观效果来看这问题。
    由于俞先生的错误的资产阶级文艺思想，俞先生对红楼梦的了解是从“色空”（一切现象终归幻灭）的基本观念出发的，于是产生了许多真假反正、可彼可此、没有肯定也没有否定的看法；又由于在俞先生思想中还有许多没落的封建主义思想的残余，就更使得俞先生对书中封建人物和封建事物没有强烈的憎恶和否定。这两种错误思想表现得最突出的就是俞先生竟把宝钗黛玉这两个性格绝不相容的人物说成作者原意是“双美合一”，并且肯定钗黛二人在八十回后感情很好，因为黛玉因病早卒，宝玉才娶宝钗，宝钗嫁后对黛玉还不胜追念；从而贬斥后四十回续写的宝黛悲剧如何如何不好。
    不错，俞先生的这一说法是有“脂批”做依据的。但是，首先，脂批不可尽信，如第一回“好了歌”中“说什么粉正浓，脂正香，如何两鬓又成霜”，对这“如何两鬓又成霜”甲戌本脂批“黛玉晴雯一干人”（原本不在，据过录本），黛玉不论，晴雯却是在七十八回就死了的，何曾活到“两鬓成霜”，我们如果信了这条脂批来推后书，那岂不该说晴雯黛玉都活到六七十岁么。所以全据脂批来推八十回以后的事，是不可靠的。另外，推测一本未完的书的后来的结局最主要的是应该以所存的书的本文做依据，而不该抛开了本文去用不可尽信的批语。从前八十回看，宝钗确实是一个典型的封建主义的忠实的信徒，黛玉则是一个强烈的反封建的青年女子的代表，这样性格绝不相同的两个人，在前八十回中就已经表现了许多不可调和的矛盾和冲突，难道到了八十回后就会忽然“化干戈为玉帛”了么，这是不能想像的。
    俞先生因为先有了一个主观唯心的“双美合一”的错误看法，并且引了“脂批”做为立论的根据；于是无视红楼梦八十回中所写的宝钗黛玉两个基本上不同的人物的矛盾和冲突，而一口认定在八十回后宝钗黛玉感情很好，“双美合一”，从而贬斥后四十回的宝黛悲剧的“不合作者原意”。
    当然，前八十回是曹雪芹作的，后四十回是别人续的，这问题是不能混淆起来的；但不把它们混淆起来不就等于否定了后四十回，不就等于无视后四十回一百多年来在广大读者中所起的作用而把它的价值一笔抹杀。
    红楼梦的后四十回自发现不是曹雪芹原著后，一向是被人贬斥的，这些贬斥，就都写在高鹗的帐上；并且更反过来，因为高鹗而贬斥后四十回——高鹗中过举人、进士，做过御史，而后四十回不幸正有“宝玉中举”一事，于是就说红楼梦后四十回整个（宝黛悲剧也在内）都要不得了。
    当然，“人”和“文”是有密切关系的。但对这问题我近来有这么一个很不成熟的新看法：我认为后四十回的绝大部分都不是高鹗续的，而是程伟元买来的别人的续作。理由是哪一些，当另外写文说明。
    我认为后四十回绝大部分都不是高鹗作的，所以不能因为高鹗之中举人、进士，做御史而菲薄整个后四十回；但后四十回买来的稿子很乱，经过高鹗整理的，在这整理的过程中他可能就加进去了一些东西——与他的功名利禄思想相称的。这些东西与买来的稿子混在一起，给红楼梦后四十回带来了芜累。我颇疑宝玉中举，贾家复兴的一些文字是高鹗后加的，因为从第九十六回至一百十七回并没写宝玉上学，也没有暗示宝玉中举的文字，而这一大段正是宝黛悲剧，宁荣破败的一连串事变的紧张场面；此前暗伏宝玉中举和此后直写宝玉中举的一些文字，如两番入家塾、讲义警顽心、试文字、中乡魁等，与一百二十回说贾家复兴的文字我疑心是高鹗加上去的。
    至于后四十回的续书者是否曾看到曹雪芹的八十回后的某些残稿，而依据这些材料续写的，我想，这可能也是有的。后四十回使红楼梦的人物和故事发展得很合理自然（宝玉中举、贾家复兴除外），可能是有依据的。
    我所以这样强调的提出后四十回绝大部分不是高鹗续的，是因为：
    后四十回故事的发展因为没有符合俞先生的“双美合一”的主观唯心的成见，写出了“宝黛悲剧”，而受到了俞先生的贬斥；但俞先生这贬斥是与贬斥“宝玉中举”同时的。所以我在这里特地说明：后四十回的绝大部分，如宝黛悲剧、宁荣破败都不是高鹗写的，而是程伟元买来的别人的续作；但宝玉中举、贾家复兴可能是高鹗加进去的。所以不能混为一谈，应该分别视之，宝玉中举是不好的，但不能因批判宝玉中举同时也否定了宝黛悲剧。
    假如我这不成熟的看法还可以成立的话，那我们对后四十回的态度就应该是：肯定原续书者所写的部分——宝黛悲剧，宁荣破败；批判高鹗加进去的部分——宝玉中举，贾家复兴；而不是像俞先生一样的把后四十回一笔抹杀。
    我代俞先生写文章这件事在我是犯了错误，俞先生也犯了错误，应当另外检讨的。今天我把这件事揭露出来，是为了把问题弄清楚，使读者知道那篇是我写的，以免在这次讨论中混淆不清；并且说出俞先生对这文章改动的情形（当然，我原来的文章中也是有许多问题的），从这些删削改动中也可以部分的说明俞先生在对红楼梦的研究中的资产阶级的文艺思想，使这次讨论更好地进行。
