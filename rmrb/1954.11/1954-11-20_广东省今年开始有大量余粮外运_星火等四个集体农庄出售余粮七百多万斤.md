Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, November 19th: In November, trains and trucks carrying grain from Guangdong Province are heading north every day. From the fourth quarter of last year to the third quarter of this year, Guangdong has shipped nearly 700 million jin of rice to support disaster areas in Hubei Province and to supply major cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, and Wuhan. This is the first year that Guangdong Province has had large-scale surplus grain exports after the implementation of the unified purchase and sale system.

Before liberation, Guangdong Province had to import more than 1 billion jin of rice every year. In the first one or two years after liberation, the state had to transfer large quantities of rice from other provinces to supply the people of Guangdong. After the land reform, the peasants of Guangdong Province launched a large-scale production movement, and by 1952, the province's grain output exceeded the consumption needs of the province's people. In 1953, the early rice harvest increased, and the province had more surplus grain, but at that time, the surplus grain was mainly in the hands of private merchants and rich peasants. It was not until the implementation of the unified purchase and sale of grain that the state controlled the province's surplus grain, which made large-scale surplus grain exports possible.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, November 19th: The Xinghuo, Liaoyuan, Qiu Shaoyun, and Hongguang collective farms in Huachuan County, Heilongjiang Province, have decided to sell all 7,862,000 jin of surplus grain to the state. This grain sales figure exceeds the grain sales figure of the four collective farms last year by more than 92 percent. With the help of the state tractor stations and water conservancy irrigation stations, more than 80 percent of the land in these four collective farms was mechanized this year, and the cultivated land was expanded by 446 hectares (15 mu per hectare). This year, the 1,173 hectares of rice planted by the four collective farms generally yielded a bumper harvest, with a total output increase of more than 4,569,000 jin compared to last year, with an average yield of 9,330 jin per hectare.

    广东省今年开始有大量余粮外运
    星火等四个集体农庄出售余粮七百多万斤
    【新华社广州十九日电】十一月份，广东省每天都有火车和汽车载着粮食源源北运。从去年第四季度到今年第三季度，广东已运出将近七亿斤大米，支援湖北省灾区和供应北京、天津、武汉等大城市。这是实行统购统销后广东省有大量余粮外运的第一年。
    解放前，广东省每年要运进大米十亿斤以上。解放后的头一、二年，国家还必须从外省调运大批大米供应广东人民。土地改革后，广东省农民展开了大生产运动，到一九五二年，全省粮食产量超过了本省人民消费的需要。一九五三年，早造稻增产，全省才有比较多的余粮，但当时余粮主要掌握在私商和富农手里。直到实行粮食统购统销，国家掌握了全省余粮，这才有大量余粮外运。
    【新华社哈尔滨十九日电】黑龙江省桦川县星火、燎原、邱少云和红光四个集体农庄决定把七百八十六万二千斤余粮全部卖给国家。这个卖粮数字超过去年四个集体农庄卖粮数字的百分之九十二以上。在国家拖拉机站和水利灌溉站的帮助下，今年这四个集体农庄有百分之八十以上的土地实行了机械作业，并扩大耕地四百四十六垧（每垧十五市亩）。今年四个集体农庄所种的一千一百七十三垧水稻普遍丰收，总产量比去年增加四百五十六万九千多斤，平均每垧产量达到九千三百三十斤。
