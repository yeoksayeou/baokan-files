　　　Overcome Blind Optimism, Strengthen Political and Ideological Work in Establishing Agricultural Production Cooperatives
　　　Shang Kai

　　After the in-depth and extensive publicity and education on the General Line, especially under the practical education and influence of the superiority of the existing agricultural production cooperatives, the broad masses of peasants have been clamoring to join agricultural production cooperatives. "The road to socialism" has become a slogan of action for the peasant masses. According to statistics from 19 provinces and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, agricultural production cooperatives have developed to more than 200,000. Cooperativeized townships and cooperativeized districts have emerged one after another. Most of the party work cadres, under this smooth situation, have been able to maintain a clear head and lead the agricultural cooperation work with humility and caution.

　　However, there are also some cadres who have been overwhelmed by this smooth situation, fostering a blind optimism. This blind optimism is mainly manifested in the fact that these cadres are only satisfied with the superficial phenomenon of the masses of peasants demanding to join the cooperatives, without going deep into the complex ideological situation of the masses in the process of joining the cooperatives, and conducting in-depth and meticulous ideological and political work according to these ideological situations. "Full of confidence" and "no problem" have become the catchphrases of these cadres.

　　We should always remember that the transformation of small-scale peasant economy is not a simple and easy task, but requires long-term and patient publicity and education work. At present, although the socialist consciousness of the peasant masses has been generally improved, not everyone is asking to join the cooperatives, and not everyone who asks to join the cooperatives is doing so consciously and voluntarily. Among them, a small number are joining the cooperatives by "following the crowd." The Duyun Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Guizhou Province conducted a survey in twelve agricultural production cooperatives and found that among those who signed up to join the cooperatives, only 30 percent truly saw the superiority of the agricultural production cooperatives and joined voluntarily; 50 percent were hesitant and signed up after education; and 20 percent signed up reluctantly due to the general trend, and these people still have more concerns in their minds. Even in areas with a better foundation for mutual aid and cooperation, the masses' thinking about joining the cooperatives is not completely mature. The Qinxian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Shanxi Province recently conducted a survey of 12,438 households who signed up to join the cooperatives and found that only 65 percent of them signed up truly voluntarily; 28 percent saw the benefits of joining the cooperatives but had concerns; and 7 percent signed up completely unconsciously, following the crowd. Therefore, we must never be complacent and blindly optimistic because of the smooth situation.

　　In the process of building cooperatives and after the new cooperatives are established, it is necessary to carry out in-depth and meticulous ideological education work to make everyone who joins the cooperative truly "ideologically joined", and to improve the understanding of those who still do not have a clear understanding after joining the cooperative, to change from involuntary to voluntary, and from not completely voluntary to completely voluntary. Even for those masses who voluntarily join the cooperatives, we must further raise their awareness and encourage them to play a backbone role in the cooperatives. If we relax or abandon the party's ideological leadership work because of the smooth situation, it will inevitably lead to failure. This is what happened in Guanzhuang, Gaoping County, Shanxi Province. Guanzhuang is one of the advanced villages in Gaoping County. Before the summer harvest this year, because the Party paid attention to ideological education work, more than 144 households of the masses signed up to join the cooperatives after the summer harvest, accounting for more than 70 percent of the total number of households in the village. The Party branch therefore became complacent, thinking that "there will be no problem in establishing a cooperative after the autumn harvest", so it relaxed the ideological education work for the masses. When it came to establishing a cooperative after the autumn harvest, 20 households openly stated that they would not join, and 40 households were also wavering.

　　It is precisely because some cadres are satisfied with the phenomenon of the masses actively signing up to join the cooperatives that they neglect to publicize the Party's policies on these issues to the masses in depth when dealing with issues such as land appraisal, pricing of draught animals and farm implements, and joining the cooperatives with mountains, forests, orchards, and flocks of sheep, and act rashly, which has aroused some unnecessary ideological concerns among the masses. These cadres did not patiently persuade and educate the masses about these ideological concerns, and even labeled them with the big hat of "small-scale peasant economy not accepting transformation." This approach, of course, cannot mobilize the masses, and it is easy to violate the Party's policy of voluntary mutual benefit and harm the enthusiasm of the masses. In Yangshufang Village, Xinjin County, Liaoning Province, the specific policies for production materials entering the cooperatives were not publicized enough, and the masses' thinking was confused from the beginning of the establishment of the cooperatives. At that time, 17 peasant households wanted to sell their livestock. Some cadres only saw the good side of many peasants actively signing up to join the cooperatives, so they put forward excessively high plans that deviated from reality. The four existing agricultural production cooperatives in Xiliangwa Village, Er District, Anping County, Hebei Province, were not well run and did not play a demonstrative role. In principle, these four cooperatives should be run well first, and then expanded. However, the Er District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Anping County ignored these circumstances and subjectively designated that the village should achieve cooperation before the autumn and that the number of households joining the cooperatives should reach more than 80 percent. In order to complete this subjective big plan, the working group stationed in the village and the township and village cadres used disguised coercive orders to mobilize the masses to join the cooperatives. Many people did not understand the idea and reluctantly signed up to join the cooperatives at the meeting, but regretted it later. The emotions of the masses fluctuated greatly, which affected the current production and disaster relief (the Shijiazhuang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has already corrected this bias). This kind of phenomenon of using coercive orders to carry out cooperative construction work has been found in many places, and the party committees in various places must pay attention to correcting this bias, and must eliminate the blind optimism from the cadres' thinking, otherwise the style of coercive orders will still grow and the Party's policy of "active leadership, steady progress" will not be correctly implemented.

　　In order to eliminate this blind optimism, the party organizations at all levels in rural areas must educate every rural work cadre to realize that the agricultural cooperation movement is a sharp and complex class struggle. At present, although socialist ideology has taken the upper hand in the vast rural areas, it must be seen that rich peasants, profiteers, and other bad elements are still using various methods to sabotage the cooperative movement. On the other hand, the broad masses of peasants, especially the large number of middle peasants, cannot but be affected by their own spontaneous tendencies and the forces of capitalism when deciding on their own path, and thus inevitably have a certain degree of wavering. This requires complex struggles and meticulous ideological work. However, the vast number of rural cadres still lack experience in this area. In the face of such arduous tasks, no rural work cadre has any reason to be blindly optimistic. Secondly, it is necessary to educate cadres to go deep into the grassroots, go deep into the masses, investigate and study the ideological situation of the masses, pay special attention to studying the doubts and concerns of the masses, and concretely help solve various difficulties in their work. This will enable cadres to maintain a clear head and have a comprehensive understanding of the problem under relatively smooth conditions. In this way, they will not be overwhelmed by victory, but will be able to correctly grasp the Party's policies and principles for the agricultural cooperation movement and ensure the healthy development of the movement.

### 克服盲目乐观情绪，加强建立农业生产合作社中的政治思想工作

    克服盲目乐观情绪，加强建立农业生产合作社中的政治思想工作
    商恺
    经过深入广泛的总路线的宣传教育，特别是在现有农业生产合作社的优越性的实际教育和影响下，广大农民群众纷纷要求参加农业生产合作社。“社会主义的道路”已变成农民群众的行动口号。根据河北等十九个省和内蒙古自治区的统计，农业生产合作社已发展到二十多万个。合作化乡，合作化区，相继出现。大部分的党的工作干部，在这种顺利形势下能够继续保持清醒头脑，虚心谨慎地领导农业合作化工作。
    但是，也有一部分干部，却被这种顺利形势冲昏了头脑，滋长着一种盲目乐观的情绪。这种盲目乐观情绪，主要表现在这些干部仅仅满足于目前农民群众要求入社的表面现象，而不去深入研究农民群众在入社过程中的复杂的思想情况，并根据这些思想情况，进行深入细致的思想政治工作。“满有把握”、“没问题了”成为这些干部的口头禅。
    应该经常记着：改造小农经济并不是一件简单容易的事情，而需要经过长期的耐心的宣传教育工作。目前，农民群众的社会主义觉悟虽然有了普遍的提高，但是，还不是每一个人都要求入社，要求入社的人也不是每一个人都是自觉自愿的。其中就有一小部分是“随大流”报名入社的。中共贵州省都匀地委曾在十二个农业生产合作社里进行了调查，发现报名入社的人，真正看到农业生产合作社的优越性，完全自觉自愿入社的，只有百分之三十；百分之五十是犹疑不定，经过教育后报名入社的；还有百分之二十是因大势所趋，勉强报名入社的，这些人在思想上还有较多的顾虑。就是在互助合作基础较好的地区，群众的入社思想也不是完全成熟的。中共山西沁县委员会最近在一万二千四百三十八户报名入社的群众中进行了一次调查，发现其中真正自觉自愿报名的不过百分之六十五；看着入社好，但又有顾虑的还有百分之二十八；完全不自觉随大流报名的占百分之七。因此，我们绝不能因为形势顺利而麻痹自满、盲目乐观。
    在建社过程中和在新社建成后，都需要进行深入细致的思想教育工作，使每个入社的人真正是“思想入社”，使入社后还认识不清的人提高认识，由不自愿变为自愿，由不完全自愿变为完全自愿。就是对那些完全自愿入社的群众，也必须进一步提高他们的觉悟，鼓励他们在社内起骨干作用。如果我们因为形势顺利而放松或放弃了党的思想领导工作，那就必然招致失败。山西省高平县官庄就是这样。官庄是高平县的先进村之一，今年夏收以前，由于党注意了思想教育工作，因此夏收以后，就有一百四十四户群众报名入社，占全村总户数的百分之七十以上。党支部因此自满起来，认为“秋后建社没问题了”，于是就放松了对群众的思想教育工作。到秋收建社的时候，有二十户公开提出不入社了，有四十户也动摇了。
    正因为有些干部满足于群众踊跃报名入社的现象，所以在处理土地评产，耕畜农具作价，以及山林、果园、羊群入社等问题时，忽略了向群众深入宣传党的有关这些问题的政策，而草率从事，以致引起了群众一些不必要的思想顾虑。对于这些思想顾虑，这些干部又不去进行耐心的说服教育，甚至给扣上个“小农经济不接受改造”的大帽子。这种作法，当然不能发动群众，而且很容易违反党的自愿互利政策，伤害群众的积极性。辽宁省新金县杨树房村，对生产资料入社的具体政策宣传的不够，建社一开始群众思想就混乱起来，当时就有十七户农民要卖牲口。还有些干部只看到许多农民积极报名入社的好的一面，因此提出了脱离实际情况的过高的计划。河北安平县二区西两洼村原有四个农业生产合作社办的不好，没有起到示范作用，按理说，应当先把这四个社办好，而后扩大。但是中共安平二区区委却不顾这些情况，主观地指定这个村秋前要实现合作化，入社户数要达到百分之八十以上。为了完成这个主观的大计划，驻村的工作组和乡、村干部就用变相强迫命令的办法去动员群众入社。很多人思想不通，勉强在大会上报名入社，以后又后悔了。群众情绪波动很大，影响了当前的生产救灾（中共石家庄地委已经纠正了这种偏向）。像这种用强迫命令办法去进行建社工作的现象，在不少地方都已发现，各地党委必须注意纠正这种偏向，并且必须从干部思想上去肃清盲目乐观情绪，否则强迫命令作风就仍会滋长起来，使党的“积极领导，稳步前进”的方针不能正确地贯彻。
    为了消除这种盲目乐观情绪，农村各级党组织必须教育每一个农村工作干部，使他们认识到农业合作化运动是一场尖锐的复杂的阶级斗争。目前，在广大的农村中，社会主义思想虽然已经占了优势，但是，必须看到富农、奸商及其他坏分子还在采用各种方法破坏合作化运动。另一方面，广大农民特别是为数很多的中农群众，在决定自己的道路时，还不能不受其本身的自发倾向及资本主义势力的影响，因而便必不可免地有一定程度的动摇。这就要经过复杂的斗争和细致的思想工作。但是广大的农村干部还缺少这方面的经验。在这样艰巨的任务面前，任何一个农村工作干部都没有理由可以盲目乐观的。其次，必须教育干部深入下层，深入群众，调查研究群众的思想情况，特别注意研究群众的怀疑和顾虑，具体帮助解决他们工作中的各种困难。这样就会使干部在比较顺利的条件下保持着清醒的头脑，全面的认识问题。这样就不致被胜利冲昏头脑，而能够正确地掌握党对农业合作化运动的方针和政策，保证运动健康的发展。
