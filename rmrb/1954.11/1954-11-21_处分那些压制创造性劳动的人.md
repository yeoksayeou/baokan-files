    Punish Those Who Suppress Creative Labor

    To the Editor:
    We accuse the leaders of the Shanxi Provincial Institute of Mining and Metallurgy of suppressing and ostracizing technician Tang Shiwu.

    Since Tang Shiwu came to the Institute of Mining and Metallurgy in April 1952, he has been enthusiastically and actively studying technology. He successfully trial-produced eight instruments, completed six technical improvements, learned and promoted two advanced Soviet experiences, put forward six rationalization proposals, and solved the technical key problem of installing the circuit connector of the honing machine, making many contributions to the country. For example, the promotion of the Soviet rapid sulfur determination method increased efficiency by 30 times; the trial-produced carbon combustion furnace not only solved the problem of elemental analysis of coal but also saved a considerable amount of investment; especially the successful trial-production of the polarograph (also called the ion polarizer, which could not be manufactured domestically in the past and was difficult to buy) enabled the sensitivity of metal analysis to reach the third decimal place, solving the problem of microanalysis of metals and ores and improving the institute's analytical technology. He is also good at exchanging experiences, helping others, and cultivating new forces. Even when he was being squeezed out, he was still thinking about the production of the institute.

    Tang Shiwu's creative work aroused the jealousy and hatred of a small group of technicians in the Institute of Mining and Metallurgy. They carried out attacks, ostracism, and framing against Tang Shiwu. For example, when Tang Shiwu promoted the rapid sulfur determination method, which increased work efficiency by 30 times, Xuan Tang (group leader) privately changed it to three times when reporting to the higher authorities. They falsely accused Tang Shiwu of damaging the PH meter, color comparator, Beckman thermometer, and broadcaster, which were broken by others or damaged due to poor storage. When Tang Shiwu proposed to trial-produce a polarograph, they collectively slandered Tang as a "personal hero," "ambitious," and "Tang the madman"; Ren Yuqing, director of the analysis laboratory, also secretly hid the institute's data and photos related to the manufacture of the polarograph, attempting to make Tang Shiwu's trial-production work fail.

    The leading cadres of the Institute of Mining and Metallurgy actually followed these technicians who were attacking Tang Shiwu and suppressed Tang Shiwu's initiative and creativity. For example, in June 1952, the director of the institute, Li Yifu, initially agreed to Tang Shiwu's proposal to trial-produce a polarograph, but later, after listening to rumors from Xuan Tang and others, he refused to approve his trial-production plan three times and convened three meetings to "rectify" Tang Shiwu's "thinking." In October 1953, Li Yifu was promoted to Deputy Director of the Shanxi Provincial Department of Industry (while still serving as Director of the Institute of Mining and Metallurgy), and Tang Shiwu's proposal to trial-produce a polarograph received some support from Du Runfu, director of the office (who was also the deputy secretary of the Party branch), and Zhang Senlin, the secretary of the Party branch. With the joint efforts of many veteran workers in the repair department, such as Zhao Jia and Li Yujin, it was finally successfully trial-produced in February 1954. After being appraised by people from the Shanxi Provincial science and technology circles, such as Professor Shi Jingshu of Shanxi University, its performance was considered good; it was exhibited at the Shanxi Provincial Technological Innovation Exhibition in August this year and was well received. Many units requested orders.

    However, the fact that the polarograph was successfully trial-produced did not change the way the leaders of the Institute of Mining and Metallurgy viewed Tang. Later, Wang Shunli, the acting director, although he clarified Tang Shiwu's work achievements, he actually put aside the 3 million yuan bonus and a certificate prepared by the Department of Industry for Tang Shiwu because he believed Li Yifu's lies. Therefore, the unhealthy atmosphere in the institute was still rampant, and Tang Shiwu continued to live a life of discrimination. He proposed a plan to put the polarograph into production three times, but none of them were approved.

    Seeing that the leading cadres in the institute held such prejudices against him, Tang Shiwu felt that he could no longer stay and requested a transfer. Wang Shunli took advantage of the situation by using the excuse of "higher-level decision" to drive Tang away and wrote some unrealistic shortcomings in his evaluation. This situation caused ideological confusion and emotional fluctuations among many technicians in the institute.

    Tang Shiwu's creative labor has been suppressed in the Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, and even after the creation has been successful, he continued to be attacked. What does this show? This shows that the base personalist jealousy and selfishness among some technicians in the Shanxi Institute of Mining and Metallurgy have developed to a serious degree of sectarianism, and the leadership has actually listened to only one side and treated this incident with a bureaucratic and subjective attitude for a long time, which is intolerable. It is hoped that the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China will conduct an inspection and handle the Tang Shiwu incident, make a clear conclusion, and further resolve all the problems existing in the Institute of Mining and Metallurgy.

### 处分那些压制创造性劳动的人

    处分那些压制创造性劳动的人编辑同志：
    我们控诉山西省工矿研究所领导人打击和排挤技术员唐世五的事件。
    唐世五一九五二年四月到工矿研究所以来，一直热情积极地钻研技术。他试制成功了八项仪器，完成了六项技术改进，学习并推广了两项苏联先进经验，提出了六项合理化建议，解决了安装摩片机电路接头的技术关键问题，对国家有了不少的贡献。如推广了苏联快速定硫分析法，提高效率三十倍；试制的炭素燃烧炉，不但解决了煤炭中元素分析问题，而且节省了相当大的一笔投资；特别是试制的极谱仪（也叫游子极化器。过去国内不能制造，也很难买到。）成功后，使金属分析的灵敏程度达到小数点以后的第三位，解决了金属、矿石的微量分析问题，提高了所内分析技术。他还善于交流经验，帮助别人，培养新生力量。直至被排挤出去时，还念念不忘于所里的生产。
    唐世五的创造性的工作，引起了工矿研究所技术人员里面的一个小集团的嫉妒和憎恨。他们对唐世五进行了打击排挤和陷害。如唐世五推广快速定硫分析法，提高工作效率三十倍，宣唐（组长）在向上级呈报时私自改成三倍。他们把别人搞坏的或因保管不善而损坏的仪器PH表、比色表、贝克马温度计、广播器等，诬赖是唐世五破坏的。当唐世五提出试制极谱仪时，他们群起诋毁唐为“个人英雄主义”、“野心家”、“唐疯子”；分析室主任任于清还把所里有关制造极谱仪的资料和照片暗藏起来，企图使唐世五的试制工作归于失败。
    工矿研究所的领导干部居然也随着这些打击唐世五的技术人员对唐世五的积极性和创造性横加压制。如一九五二年六月间，所长李一夫开始同意唐世五试制极谱仪的建议，后来听信了宣唐等人的流言蜚语，三次拒绝批准他的试制计划，并先后召开三次会来“整”唐世五的“思想”。一九五三年十月李一夫调升山西省工业厅副厅长（仍兼工矿研究所所长），唐世五试制极谱仪的建议得到了办公室主任杜润福（党内是支部副书记）和党支部书记张森林的一些支持。并在修理部许多老工人如赵嘉、李玉金等的共同努力下，终于在一九五四年二月最后试制成功了。经过山西省科学技术界人士如山西大学教授史景书等的鉴定，认为性能良好；今年八月间在山西省技术革新展览会上展览，深得好评。有不少单位要求订货。
    但是，极谱仪试制成功的事实，并没有使工矿研究所的领导人改变对唐的看待，后来代理所长王顺理虽然弄清了唐世五的工作成绩，但由于轻信李一夫的谰言，居然把工业厅准备给唐世五的三百万元奖金和一张奖状搁下不办。因此，所里邪气照样嚣张，唐世五过的仍然是被歧视的生活，他三次提出把极谱仪投入生产的计划，都没有得到批准。
    唐世五见到所内领导干部这样对他抱成见，觉得不能再呆下去了，才要求调动工作。而王顺理竟借口“上级决定”，顺水推舟地把唐撵走，并在他的鉴定上写上一些不合实际的缺点。这个情况使所内不少技术人员思想混乱，情绪波动。
    唐世五的创造性的劳动在工矿研究所一直遭到压制，甚至在创造已经成功后还继续受到打击，这说明什么呢？这说明了山西工矿研究所部分技术人员中卑鄙的个人主义的嫉妒、自私已发展到严重的宗派主义地步，而领导上竟然偏听偏信，长期以官僚主义、主观主义态度对待这一事件，这是令人不能容忍的。希望中共山西省委员会通过检查和处理唐世五事件，作出明确的结论，进一步解决工矿研究所存在着的一切问题。
