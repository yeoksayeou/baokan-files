Chongqing Transportation Company's Xu Songshu and other four driving teams
Emphasize driving safety and complete the annual transportation plan ahead of schedule

The Xu Songshu, Zhang Zhibao, Huang Haiping, and Shi Shuyi driving teams of Chongqing Transportation Company have completed their annual transportation plans two to three months ahead of schedule. From January to September this year, they saved and increased production for the country by a total of 1.49 billion yuan.

The drivers of these teams all attach great importance to vehicle maintenance and driving safety. They conscientiously implement the three-level maintenance system, regularly inspect vehicle parts, frequently add lubricating oil, and keep the chassis and engine clean, thereby reducing part wear and breakdowns and increasing vehicle turnover rate. During driving, they always maintain medium-speed driving, and carefully check the steering wheel and brakes and other safety parts at each station. As a result, these teams have not had any accidents in more than ten months. At the same time, they united and helped each other in production, often held meetings to understand each other's situations, urged each other to implement production plans, and carried out technical mutual assistance. No matter which vehicle had a problem, everyone worked together to help repair it. (Yang Hongjie)

    重庆运输公司徐松树等四个行车小组
    重视行车安全提前完成全年运输计划
    重庆运输公司徐松树、张知保、黄海萍、师淑义等四个行车小组，已提前两个月到三个月完成了全年运输计划。今年一至九月份，他们共为国家增产节约十四亿九千多万元。
    这几个小组的驾驶员，都非常重视车辆的保养工作和行车的安全。他们认真贯彻三级保养制，按时检查车辆机件，经常加润滑油，保持底盘和引擎的清洁，因而减少了机件损耗和抛锚现象，提高了车辆周转率。在行车途中，他们始终保持中速行驶，每到一个站就认真检查方向盘和煞车等安全机件，因此十个多月以来，这几个组没有发生过任何事故。同时，他们在生产上团结互助，经常举行碰头会，互相了解情况，互相督促执行生产计划，并展开技术互助，无论那一个车子出了毛病，大家都一齐动手帮着修理。　　　（杨鸿杰）
