    Self-Confession
    —Commenting on Churchill's Speech at Woodford
    Soviet Union You. Bafuluofu

    "All sorts of old and absurd opinions have been brought out again. The specter of Bolshevism occupies an important place in this puppet show. Fortunately, we immediately recognized this brightly painted puppet. It is an old acquaintance of ours; it appeared in the early days of the Nazi regime... At that time, it was used to scare Europe... Now, this red specter has been brought out once again, this time associated with another figure. Some people taught us to see Hitler as the savior of European civilization... The savior of civilization—what a great irony!"

    Could it be that these ironic words of reactionary propaganda are being spoken today? Today, some people are once again sparing no effort to try to scare Western Europe with the "red threat," and have taken all steps to restore Hitler's prestige. Hitler's generals are already preparing to wear the armbands of the resurrected German "Wehrmacht." No, these poignant and accurate words were spoken in February 1943. The person who spoke these words was the British Foreign Secretary Eden. This representative of the British government was at that time calling on Soviet and British soldiers to fight together against the terrible threat to the entire Western civilization and to jointly achieve final victory.

    However, today everyone can see that "all sorts of old and absurd opinions" have been brought out again. The "specter of Bolshevism" this time occupies an "important place" "in this puppet show" once again.

    Those who are keen to revive the "Wehrmacht" use this specter to intimidate Britain and do not hesitate to declare that the defeated Hitler's generals and their successors are needed to save Western civilization. However, they repeatedly assert that once the Paris Accords are ratified, once the West German forces pursuing revenge are established, and once they point the tanks, planes, and artillery of the West German forces towards the East, they will begin to establish…friendship with the Soviet Union. This is why they call the revived "Wehrmacht" a "bridge to peace."

    If it were not for a new event that occurred a few days ago, all these crude propaganda tricks would have been too old and clumsy to mention. The event is this: British Prime Minister Churchill felt that it was appropriate and permissible to openly talk about the benefits of Britain forming an alliance with German revanchists whose spearhead is directed at the Soviet Union.

    In his speech at Woodford, Churchill boasted that he was one of the first famous politicians to publicly declare that Britain must get Germany on its side to deal with Russian communist aggression. However, it is doubtful whether he was truly unprecedented in this regard: the idea of Britain joining forces with Germany to attack the Soviet Union had long been conceived by Hess, Hitler's closest aide, who was sentenced to life imprisonment by the Nuremberg International Tribunal as a war criminal.

    However, today Churchill clearly does not want Hess to have all the credit. He is willing to bring out facts to convince everyone that he had long been advocating cooperation with the Nazis to oppose the Soviet Union.

    Churchill said that "even before the end of the war, when hundreds of thousands of Germans were surrendering," he had cabled Marshal Montgomery, instructing him to "carefully collect the German weapons and store them away, so that, if the Soviets continued to advance, it would be very convenient to reissue this batch of weapons to the German soldiers with whom we must cooperate."

    In February 1945, when the Soviet army was expanding their victorious offensive and pursuing and annihilating the Nazis inside Germany, Churchill wrote that the Red Army was celebrating the 27th anniversary of its founding with brilliant victories, and because of these victories, it had gained the infinite praise of its allies and had doomed German militarism. He said that future generations would, like those who had witnessed the Red Army's glorious victories, unreservedly thank the Red Army.

    However, the Soviet people, when reading these words, did not think that within two months, the British Commander-in-Chief Montgomery would be ordered by Churchill to begin "carefully collecting" the weapons seized from the enemy, and to prepare to return these weapons to the enemy and cooperate with those whom Churchill had always contemptuously called "German barbarians."

    British official spokesmen publicly stated during the war: "In the final stages of German propaganda, a line of argument began to appear: 'Hold on a little longer, and the Anglo-Saxons will split with the Russians.' You all know that these hopes have been dashed." But now we know from Churchill that in a letter he wrote to British Foreign Secretary Eden on May 5, 1945, when talking about British tanks rushing forward to occupy Denmark, he said that these tanks were also to block the path of their Soviet friends in that region.

    This is Churchill's view of his responsibilities as an ally.

    However, the Soviet people had a different understanding of this responsibility. It is enough to give just one example: At the end of December 1944, the Hitlerite army launched an offensive in the Ardennes region of the Western Front, breaking through the front line and putting the Anglo-American forces in an extremely embarrassing situation. Therefore, Churchill wrote to J.V. Stalin on January 6, 1945, requesting that the Soviet army launch a large-scale offensive to assist the Anglo-American forces. The Soviet Supreme High Command decided to launch a full-scale offensive on January 12 on a wide front from the Baltic Sea to the Carpathian Mountains. This powerful blow from the East forced the German Supreme Command to withdraw troops from the Western Front to deal with the Soviet army. In this way, the German offensive on the Western Front collapsed.

    The mouthpiece of the West German revanchists, the "Rheinische Post," is today praising Churchill's "hatred of communism." The newspaper says that this quality, which German revanchists find very commendable, fully explains Churchill's behavior during the war.

    The Soviet people have long known that Churchill opposes communism. Everyone has known this since the days when the young Soviet Republic, surrounded by capitalist countries, fought heroically against the interventionists to defend its right to survive. Churchill was one of the organizers of the fourteen-nation crusade against the Soviet state. Incidentally, the outcome of that crusade is also well known: the Soviet people defeated the interventionists.

    A politician as experienced as Churchill certainly knows perfectly well that his position as Prime Minister obligates him to abide by the norms of relations arising from treaties concluded with allied countries, regardless of whether he likes their social system. It should not be forgotten that when Marshal Montgomery, on Churchill's instructions, was busy collecting the weapons abandoned on the battlefield by the defeated German fascist army in order to rearm them and drive them against the Soviet people, the Soviet Union and Britain were still allies. This fundamentally changes the whole question: the question is not about Mr. Churchill's attitude toward communism, but about the attitude of the head of the British government toward its allies.

    In this regard, one cannot help but recall what the British politician Lloyd George said about Churchill in his memoirs. As early as the First World War, when it was necessary to decide whether Churchill should be included in the government, according to Lloyd George, the question was: Is Churchill more dangerous as an enemy or as an ally? The Conservative leader at the time, Bonar Law, categorically stated that he would at any time prefer to have Churchill as an enemy. Lloyd George added: At that time, Churchill was not seen as a positive figure who must be utilized in times of danger, but rather as another danger that must be guarded against.

    Let us leave aside what Churchill's colleagues said about Churchill during the First World War. However, the Soviet public cannot remain indifferent to his plans during the Second World War—to arm German fascists and direct them against the Soviet Union.

    What do the Soviet people think of Churchill's plans? Undeniably, this is the simplest possible plan to revive German militarism; a plan to revive German militarism while allies were still lying wounded on the battlefield from the common fight; the fires of Majdanek and Auschwitz, where millions of victims of fascism were burned alive, had not yet been extinguished, and Churchill was already rushing to return weapons to those who dreamed of filling all of Europe with concentration camps.

    It is not Churchill's fault that the implementation of this "simple" plan has been delayed for nine years. Even today, the initiators of this aggressive plan still have to go to great lengths to disguise the plan to revive the German "Wehrmacht," because they fear that the people of all countries will once again thwart this plan.

    However, there is another characteristic of Churchill's plans at the end of the war and his current intention to revive German militarism. This characteristic cannot be concealed, and all honest people can see it. This characteristic should be given a name according to its actual content, and its Russian name is: вероломство (treachery).

    The Soviet people do not value this characteristic. The British people will also not value this characteristic, and they regard Churchill's speech at Woodford as a self-confession of a politician who has more than once concealed his aggressive plans with hypocritical rhetoric.

    Labour MP Barbara Castle said that Churchill's explicit words show that since 1945, Russia has had every reason to distrust him. Many comments from other British figures and newspapers also hold this view.

    There is no doubt that the peace-loving people of all countries will give Churchill's speech an appropriate evaluation. The purpose of this speech is to allow the forces that act as executors of aggressive policies and policies that create hatred among the people of all countries to act without scruples.

    The following is the correspondence between Churchill and Stalin during the Ardennes offensive in January 1945:

    As everyone knows, at the end of December 1944, the Hitlerite army launched an offensive in the Ardennes area of the Western Front, breaking through the Anglo-American defenses and putting them in a difficult situation. According to the Allies themselves, the German army wanted to strike the Liege position, defeat the US 1st Army, advance towards Antwerp, cut off the US 9th Army, the British 2nd Army, and the Canadian 1st Army, and create a second Dunkirk for the Allied forces in order to strike Britain out of the war.

    Because of this, Winston Churchill wrote to J.V. Stalin on January 6, 1945, with the following content:

     "The battle on the Western Front is urgent, and the Supreme Command must make a decisive decision. Your Excellency, based on your own experience, knows very well how critical it is to defend a vast front after losing the initiative. General Eisenhower is very willing and must know in general the actions that Your Excellency intends to take, because such actions will certainly affect Eisenhower and all our critical decisions. According to the information I have received, our representative, Air Chief Marshal Tedder, was delayed in Cairo last night due to weather conditions. He has been detained for a long time along the way, and the blame does not lie with you. If he has not yet arrived at your place, then I hope Your Excellency will give advance notice of whether we can count on "the Russian army starting a large-scale offensive on the Vistula River front or elsewhere in January, and I hope to see any other matters that Your Excellency is willing to inform me of. I will not tell anyone else about this extremely secret information except to pass it on to Marshal Brooke and General Eisenhower and instruct them to keep it strictly confidential. Please reply quickly."

    On January 7, 1945, J.V. Stalin gave W. Churchill the following reply:

      "Your letter of January 6, 1945, was received on the evening of January 7.

    "Unfortunately, Air Chief Marshal Tedder has not yet arrived in Moscow.

    "It is very important to use the superiority of our army over the German army in terms of artillery and air power. To achieve this goal, there must be good weather conducive to air operations and low-level clouds that do not hinder artillery fire. Our army is preparing to attack, but the weather is currently unfavorable for our army's offensive. However, the Supreme Command Headquarters of our army, taking into account the situation of our allies on the Western Front, has decided to speed up the completion of offensive preparations, and regardless of the weather, will begin a large-scale offensive against the German army on the entire central front no later than the second half of January. Your Excellency can rest assured that we will do everything we can to assist our glorious allies."

    On January 9, Churchill replied to J.V. Stalin: "I am extremely grateful for Your Excellency's exciting letter. I have given Your Excellency's letter to General Eisenhower, instructing him to know only this. I wish Your Excellency's grand strategy complete success!"

    In order to accelerate the assistance to the Allied forces on the Western Front, the Soviet Supreme High Command decided to change the date of the offensive against the German army on the Soviet-German front from January 20 to January 12. On January 12, the Soviet army launched a large-scale offensive on a wide front from the Baltic Sea to the Carpathian Mountains. The Soviet troops participating in this offensive numbered 150 divisions, as well as a large number of artillery units and air forces. They broke through the German defense line and pushed the German army back hundreds of kilometers.

    On January 12, the German troops on the Western Front, including the 5th and 6th Panzer Armies specifically assigned to new strike missions, immediately ceased offensive operations and were transferred from the Western Front to the Eastern Front within five or six days to resist the advancing Soviet army. The German offensive on the Western Front was thus broken.

    On January 17, 1945, Churchill wrote to J.V. Stalin with the following content: "Your Excellency's letter has been received, and I am extremely grateful. I am very pleased that Air Chief Marshal Tedder is deeply appreciated by Your Excellency. On behalf of the Government of the United Kingdom, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Your Excellency for starting a powerful offensive on the Eastern Front, and I would like to congratulate you..."

    不打自招
    ——评论邱吉尔在伍德佛的演说
    苏联  尤·巴夫洛夫
    “各式各样陈旧、荒唐的意见又全都搬出来了。布尔什维主义的魔影在这幕傀儡戏中占有重要地位。幸而我们一下子就把这个涂得很鲜艳的傀儡识破了。它是我们的老相识了，它在纳粹政权的初期就出现过……当时用它来吓唬欧洲……现在，这个赤色魔影又一次被搬了出来，这次同另一个人物相关联着。有人教我们把希特勒看作欧洲文明的救星……文明的救星——多大的讽刺！”
    难道这番讽刺反动宣传的话是在今天说的吗？今天，有人正在再一次不遗余力地设法拿“赤色威胁”来吓唬西欧，而且已采取了一切步骤来恢复希特勒的威望，希特勒的将军们已经准备戴上复活中的德国“国防军”的臂章。不，这些痛切的、确当的话是一九四三年二月说出来的。说这番话的人是英国外交大臣艾登。英国政府的这个代表当时是在呼吁苏联同英国士兵一同作战来反对整个西方文明所受到的可怕威胁，并且共同取得最后胜利。
    但是，今天大家都看到，“各式各样陈旧、荒唐的意见”又一次全都被搬出来了。“布尔什维主义的魔影”这次“在这幕傀儡戏中”又占“重要地位”。
    热中于复活“国防军”的人用这个魔影来恫吓英国，并且毫不犹豫地宣布需要被击败了的希特勒将领和他们的继承人来拯救西方文明。然而，他们还一再断言，一旦巴黎协定得到批准，一旦追求复仇的西德军队建立起来，一旦他们把西德军队的坦克、飞机和大炮对着东方，他们就会开始同苏联建立……友谊。这就是他们把复活中的“国防军”叫做“通往和平的桥梁”的缘故。
    如果不是因为在几天前发生了一个新的事件，这一切粗劣的宣传伎俩本来是陈旧、笨拙得不值一提的。这件事就是：英国的邱吉尔首相觉得：公开地谈谈英国同矛头对着苏联的德国复仇主义者结成联盟的好处，是适宜的，而且是可以允许的。
    邱吉尔在伍德佛的演说中说明这些计划时竟然夸口说，他是最早公开宣布英国必须使德国站在它这一边来对付俄国共产主义侵略的有名的政治家之一。但是，在这方面是否真是前无古人是值得怀疑的：英国同德国联合起来进攻苏联的主意很早以前就已经由希特勒最亲密的助手、被纽伦堡国际法庭当做战犯判处了无期徒刑的赫斯想出来了。
    但是，今天邱吉尔显然不愿让赫斯专美于前。他愿意拿出事实来使每个人都相信：他老早就在鼓吹同纳粹合作一同反对苏联的主张了。
    邱吉尔说，“甚至在战争结束以前，在数以十万计的德国人投降的时候”，他就已经打电报给蒙哥马利元帅，指示他“仔细收集德国人的武器，把它们收藏起来，这样，如果苏联继续前进的话，就可以很方便地把这批武器重新发给我们必须与之合作的德国士兵”。
    一九四五年二月，当苏联军队扩大他们的胜利攻势、在德国境内追歼纳粹的时候，邱吉尔写道：红军正以辉煌的胜利来庆祝建军二十七周年，由于这些胜利，它得到了它的盟国的无限赞扬，并且注定了德国军国主义的命运。他说，以后世世代代的人都会像那些亲眼看见红军的光荣胜利的人一样，毫无保留地感激红军。
    不过，苏联人民在读到这些字句的时候，并没有想到：不出两个月，英国的蒙哥马利总司令就奉到邱吉尔的命令，开始“仔细收集”从敌人手里夺来的武器，并且准备把这些武器再还给敌人，准备同邱吉尔一向鄙夷地称作“德国蛮子”的那些人合作。
    英国官方发言人在战时公开发表的言论中说：“在德国的宣传的最后阶段，又有一种论调开始出现：再多坚持一会儿，盎格鲁—撒克逊人就要同俄国人分裂了。你们都知道，这些希望已经破灭了。”但是，现在我们从邱吉尔那里知道，他在一九四五年五月五日写给英国外交大臣艾登的信里，在谈到向前疾进赶去占领丹麦的英国坦克时说，这些坦克也要在那个地区挡住它们的苏联朋友的路。
    这就是邱吉尔对自己作为盟友的职责的看法。
    但是，苏联人民对这种职责却有不同的领会。只要举一个例子就够了：一九四四年十二月末，希特勒军队在西战场阿登地区发动攻势，突破战线，使英美军队处境极其狼狈。因此，邱吉尔在一九四五年一月六日写信给约·维·斯大林，要求苏军发动一次大规模的攻势，援助英美军队。苏军最高统帅部决定在一月十二日在从波罗的海到喀尔巴阡山的广阔战线上全线进攻。这一个来自东方的有力打击迫使德国最高司令部从西战场抽出了军队来对付苏军。就这样，德军在西战场的攻势才归于瓦解。
    西德复仇主义者的喉舌“莱因信息报”今天在歌颂邱吉尔“对共产主义的仇恨”。这家报纸说，德国复仇主义者认为很值得赞美的这种品质充分说明了邱吉尔在战时的行为。
    苏联人民很久以来就知道邱吉尔反对共产主义。从受到资本主义国家包围的年青的苏维埃共和国为了保卫自己生存的权利对干涉军英勇奋战的日子起，大家就知道这一点。邱吉尔是反对苏维埃国家的十四国十字军的组织者之一。附带说一下，那次十字军的下场也是大家都知道的：苏联人民击溃了干涉者。
    像邱吉尔这样有经验的政治家当然完全知道，他的首相地位使他有义务遵守那种由于同盟国缔结条约而产生的关系的准则，不管他是否喜欢它们的社会制度。不应该忘记：蒙哥马利元帅奉邱吉尔的指示忙着收集溃败了的德国法西斯军队遗弃在战场上的武器以便重新武装他们，并且驱使他们反对苏联人民，当时，苏联同英国还是盟国。这一点就使全部问题有了根本的改变：问题不在于邱吉尔先生对共产主义的态度，而在于英国政府首脑对盟国的态度。
    关于这一点，人们不能不想起英国政治家劳埃德·乔治在他的回忆录中谈到邱吉尔时所讲的一番话。早在第一次世界大战期间，在需要决定是否应该使邱吉尔参加政府的时候，据劳埃德说，问题就是：邱吉尔是作为政敌危险呢，还是作为盟友危险？当时的保守党领袖邦奈尔·劳斩钉截铁地说，他任何时候都宁愿让邱吉尔作为一个政敌。劳埃德·乔治又说：在那个时候，邱吉尔没有被看成是一个在危险关头必须加以利用的正面人物，而是被看作必须加以提防的另一个危险。
    邱吉尔的同僚们在第一次世界大战期间谈到邱吉尔时到底谈了一些什么话，让我们撇开不谈吧。但是，对于他在第二次世界大战期间的计划——武装德国法西斯分子并且指使他们反对苏联，苏联公众却不能漠不关心。
    苏联人民对邱吉尔的这些计划有什么看法呢？无可否认，这是最简单不过的复活德国军国主义的计划；当盟友在共同的战斗中还负伤躺在战场上的时候，把德国军国主义复活起来的计划，把法西斯主义的千百万受害者活活烧死的麦丹尼克和奥斯威辛的炉火还没有熄灭，邱吉尔就已经急忙把武器交还给那些梦想使集中营遍布全欧洲的人了。
    这个“简单”的计划的实施一直拖了九年，可不是邱吉尔的过错。就是在今天，这个侵略计划的倡议者还不得不千方百计地把复活德国“国防军”的计划伪装起来，因为他们害怕各国人民会再次挫败这个计划。
    不过，邱吉尔在战争结束时期的计划和他目前复活德国军国主义的意图还有一个特点。这个特点也是掩盖不了的，一切正直的人们都看得见这个特点。这个特点应该按其实际内容定一个名称，它的俄文名称是：вероломство（背信弃义）。
    苏联人民并不重视这个特点。英国人民也不会重视这个特点，他们把邱吉尔在伍德佛的演说看作是一个不止一次地用伪善的词藻掩饰他的侵略计划的政客不打自招的供词。
    工党议员巴巴拉·卡斯尔说，邱吉尔这种露骨的话表明：从一九四五年起，俄国有一切理由不信任他。其他一些英国人士和报刊的许多言论也有这样的意见。
    毫无疑问，热爱和平的各国人民会给邱吉尔的演说以适当的评价。这篇演说的目的，是要让那些充当侵略政策及在各国人民中间制造仇恨的政策的执行者的力量无所忌惮。
    下面是邱吉尔同斯大林在一九四五年一月阿登战役时期通信的情况：
    大家知道，一九四四年十二月末，希特勒军队在西战场阿登一带举行进攻，突破了英美军的防线，使它们陷于窘境，据盟国自己证明，德军想打击列日阵地，击溃美军第一军，向安特卫普突进，截断美军第九军、英军第二军和加拿大军第一军，想给盟军造成第二个敦刻尔克，以便把英国从战争中打击出去。
    温斯顿·邱吉尔因为这件事在一九四五年一月六日致函约·维·斯大林，其内容如下：
      “西战场战斗紧急，最高统帅部必须当机立断。阁下根据自己的经验，当深知要在主动权暂时失去之后来防守极辽阔的阵线，该是如何危急。艾森豪威尔将军很愿意而且必须大体知道阁下所预定采取的行动，因为这种行动当然会影响到艾森豪威尔以及我们的全部紧要决定。据我所接到的消息，我方代表，即空军上将泰德因天候关系，昨晚留滞在开罗。他沿途停滞了很久，其咎不在贵方。如果他尚未到达贵处，那么，就盼望阁下预先通知一声，究竟我们能否指“俄军于一月间在维斯拉河阵线或其他地方开始大规模的进攻，并盼望把阁下所愿告知的其他种种事项一并见示。这一极秘密的消息，除了转达勃鲁克元帅和艾森豪威尔将军并责其严守秘密外我决不告诉其他任何人。务请火速赐覆。”
    一九四五年一月七日，约·维·斯大林给温·邱吉尔作了如下的答复：
      “一九四五年一月六日赠函已于一月七日晚间收到。
    “可惜空军上将泰德至今尚未到达莫斯科。
    “利用我军在炮空方面对德军的优势，此点甚为重要。为了达到这一目的，就要有便利空军行动的良好天候和没有妨碍炮兵射击的低层云雾。我军正在准备进攻，但此刻天候对我军进攻不利。然而，我军最高统帅大本营估计到西战场上我盟军情况，已决定加速结束进攻准备事宜，并不问天候如何，决至迟于一月下半月内在全中央战线上开始向德军大举进攻。阁下尽可相信，我们为了协助我们光荣的盟军，必将做到我们所能做到的一切。”
    一月九日，邱吉尔复信约·维·斯大林：“阁下这封令人兴奋的信，使我不胜感激。我已经把尊函交给艾森豪威尔将军，只令他一人知道。祝阁下宏谋大策完全成功！”
    苏军最高统帅部为加速援助西战场盟军起见，于是决定把苏德战场上进攻德军的日期，从一月二十日改到一月十二日。一月十二日，苏军在从波罗的海到喀尔巴阡山这一广阔阵线上开始了大规模的进攻。参加这次进攻的苏军部队计一百五十个师团以及大批炮队和空军。它们突破了德军阵线，把德军击退了几百公里之远。
    一月十二日，西战场上的德军，其中包括有专任新打击任务的第五和第六坦克军，立刻停止了进攻动作，并在五六天内就从西战场调到了东战场上，来抵抗正在攻击前进的苏军。德军在西战场上的攻势就被打破了。
    一九四五年一月十七日，邱吉尔致函约·维·斯大林，其内容如下：“尊函奉悉，感激莫名。空军上将泰德深受阁下赏识，诚不胜欣愉。兹因阁下在东战场上开始雄强攻势，谨代表联合王国政府向阁下深致谢忱，并特此祝贺……”（引自一九四八年“苏联情报局历史事实考证”）
