    Lessons from the Mutual Aid and Cooperation Movement in Tubagang Township, Kaifeng County
    Since the publicity of the General Line last winter and this spring, the socialist atmosphere in Tubagang Township has surged. "Resolutely taking the socialist road, there is no mistake in listening to the Communist Party," this is the voice of about 20% of the township's farmers—mainly cadres, party members, members of the Communist Youth League, and poor peasant activists; from "stopping to take a look" to "we have to take this road, better to go early than late," this is the attitude of most middle peasants and some poor peasants in the township who are so-called "riding the wave" and "watching the trend"; in addition, there are a few middle peasants and wealthy households who, on the surface, "understand the ideology very well," but are struggling fiercely in their hearts. In the socialist tide, every farmer in the township is considering and choosing his own path.
    At this important moment, the comrades of the work team sent to Tubagang by the Zhengzhou Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China did not more soberly analyze the facts with a class perspective, grasp the specific thoughts of the farmers, and work diligently, but became blindly optimistic. They did not deeply appreciate Chairman Mao's instruction: "The serious problem is to educate the peasants," but regarded the socialist transformation of the peasants as an easy task. They liked to say loudly at mass meetings: "See who walks the fastest!" "Spontaneous forces are a dead end!"
    As a result, more than 90% of the farmers in the township were organized in a whirlwind, and the number of households participating in cooperatives or similar cooperative forms accounted for 40% of the total number of households in the township. Most of the more than thirty wealthy farmers in the township were also allowed to join mutual aid and cooperative organizations, and some were even requested to join by township cadres who envied them for having complete sets of livestock and farm implements, or for having clan and kinship ties.
    Obviously, these farmers who joined the cooperatives, with the exception of a few cadres, party members, members of the Communist Youth League, and activists, the majority of the so-called "riding the wave" and "watching the trend" farmers, especially the middle peasants, were to a large extent blind, and some were even afraid of being labeled as "spontaneous forces" and joined, and they were still watching the facts happening before them to decide whether to continue to advance or retreat. Before the publicity of the General Line, although the township had undergone a general election movement (it was the earliest pilot township for general elections in the province), and the farmers had a certain ideological awareness foundation, agricultural production cooperatives were still appearing for the first time, lacking both examples and experience. The comrades of the work team did not fully recognize and estimate these situations and difficulties at that time, and they even said that the participation of wealthy farmers in the cooperatives was "a manifestation of advanced work." A kind of blindly complacent emotion made the comrades of the work team unable to truly understand the Party's policy of actively leading and steadily advancing in running cooperatives and the class policy, and even felt that certain policies could not be applied in this township.
    The situation in the township's cooperatives was very chaotic, and many of the systems in the cooperatives did not conform to the policy of relying on poor peasants and uniting with middle peasants. The land was mostly graded according to the standard of surveying fields and determining production, which was far lower than the actual output; the valuation of livestock and farm implements was sometimes too high and sometimes too low; the work point evaluation and distribution system generally disadvantaged labor. For example, in the "spontaneous cooperative" led by Qiao Zhenjia, the land was uniformly rated as the second grade of surveyed fields and determined production regardless of its quality, labor was implemented with fixed points and fixed records, land and labor were divided into half shares, and livestock feed was deducted from the labor income. The members were full of complaints and their labor enthusiasm was low. Among these cooperatives, four were later approved by the higher authorities as formal, while the other eighteen were so-called "spontaneous cooperatives" that the work team neither denied nor actively led, but allowed them to "develop freely" for a long time.
    Without a banner and lacking experience, the work team should have concentrated its efforts on running a key cooperative well first, creating experience, and establishing a banner. However, the agricultural production cooperative led by Party branch secretary Su Ju, which was watched by the masses of the township, was not run well. Su Ju had bravely led the masses of the township through the anti-feudal road, but his conservative and selfish side developed with the development of his economic life. The comrades of the work team were tolerant and accommodating to his backward side. This year's wheat season profit distribution, he violated the instructions of the leadership and implemented "one-nine profit distribution" (labor one, land nine). The People's Government successively loaned money to support his cooperative in drilling four wells, and they drilled the wells in the vegetable gardens within the cooperative as sideline production; this autumn, the cooperative's sorghum and millet were reduced in production because they could not withstand the drought and suffered from insect pests. They organized a cooperative, but spontaneous forces did not stop developing; after the publicity of the General Line, some wealthy members still bought the grain of poor members and hoarded it in their own hands. Su Quan, the deputy director, whose life gradually became richer, also became more and more troublesome; he was determined not to let the cooperative run well, he wanted to "leave the cooperative to do business." Therefore, the masses were indifferent to and even ridiculed this so-called "key cooperative."
    The cooperative led by the branch secretary was like this, which could not but affect the whole township. No matter what work was done in the township, no matter how the work team came up with a plan, and no matter how many meetings were held from within the Party to outside the Party, it was always difficult to implement it, and often the meeting was over, and the work was also over.
    After the publicity of the General Line, there were still more than thirty landlords, wealthy farmers, and middle peasants and wealthy households in the township lending money at usurious rates, while the cadres of the state bank found it difficult to recover the state loans in this township. The township's grain unified purchase task was also not well completed, and the work team was helpless against those wealthy households who refused to sell surplus grain because they were afraid of "stimulating their feelings."
    "Poor peasants come to the fore, middle peasants and wealthy farmers are in power." This is the dissatisfaction of the poor peasants in this township. The poor peasants here seem to be "supporting actors," looking up and begging others for help. Since the poor peasants have not become a force to be relied on, the middle peasants have left them; in this way, a solid alliance of poor peasants and middle peasants has not been formed, and the wealthy farmers have become more and more rampant. The divisive and disintegrative effect of wealthy farmers on mutual aid and cooperative organizations has become increasingly obvious. In the "spontaneous cooperative" led by township committee member Dong Jianbang (which included three wealthy farmer households), when the members discussed merging with the cooperative led by Dong Jingsheng, which was run better, the wealthy farmer Dong Jingrong spoke: "Dong Jianbang, you are the leader, do you really want to lead us to surrender?" Another wealthy farmer, Dong Jingfu, added: "Don't be confused, merge the cooperatives! It's more free to eat and drink outside, you won't be able to make decisions in socialism." In this way, the young buds of socialist consciousness of those poor peasant members who originally wanted to merge the cooperatives were destroyed. They really started eating and drinking heavily. During the three months before and after the wheat harvest this year, the whole cooperative of fifteen households slaughtered two pigs. The cooperative originally planned to buy a rubber-wheeled cart, but it didn't buy it, and instead distributed more than ten million yuan to each household to spend at will. In another "spontaneous cooperative" led by township cadre Li Wencai, two wealthy farmer households were also in power behind the scenes. When the later work team cadres began to realize this situation, but did not firmly propose to clean out these two wealthy farmer households, Li Wencai became anxious and said: "If you ask them to leave the cooperative, I will also leave the cooperative."
    The Zhengzhou Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China sent a work team to reside here, but it did not conduct a thorough inspection of the key township it controlled for a long time; the Kaifeng County Committee of the Communist Party of China, which was responsible for leadership, thought that Tubagang was a key township of the Prefectural Committee, so it shirked and indulged it. In this way, the cooperativization movement in Tubagang has not yet embarked on the right path from the beginning to the present. Now, the tide of great development of cooperatives is about to come, but the mutual aid and cooperation movement in Tubagang is silent and fragmented. The poor peasants are hesitating and depressed, and some are even following the wealthy farmers; many middle peasants are threatening to leave the cooperatives, they are unwilling to apply fertilizer to the fields, and some are using most of their money to build new houses. The "spontaneous cooperative" led by middle peasant Liu Yin was originally organized because "we have to take this road, better to go early than late"; but now that cadres are mobilizing them to negotiate with other "spontaneous cooperatives" to merge and formally run cooperatives, they are shaking their heads again. They said: "Let's stop and take a look again." The Qiao Zhenjia "spontaneous cooperative," which had repeatedly requested to formally run a cooperative in the past, now also expressed its desire to "maintain the status quo." They said: "It's quite free to do it this way!"
    The comrades of the work team felt that the work in Tubagang was more difficult than "an old ox pulling a broken cart," and they were very distressed. Some comrades still did not understand the reason, and they hoped to find a "new way" to reverse this situation. It is very clear that if they still cannot lead and educate the peasants with a clear socialist ideology as in the past, and if they still depart from the Party's complete class policy of "relying on the poor peasants, firmly uniting with the middle peasants, and gradually restricting and eliminating wealthy peasant exploitation" as in the past, then they cannot hope to find any "new way."

    开封县土柏岗乡互助合作运动中的教训
    本报记者　吕建中
    去冬今春宣传总路线以后，土柏岗乡的社会主义空气高涨起来了。“坚决走社会主义道路，听共产党的话没有错”，这是约占全乡百分之二十的农民——主要是干部、党员、团员和贫雇农积极分子的声音；由“停一停看”进而“非走这条路不可啦，晚走不如早走”，这是全乡所谓“赶浪头”，“看大势”的大多数中农和一部分贫农的态度；另外也有少数中农、富裕户，表面上“思想很通”，内心却斗争得特别厉害。在社会主义的声浪中，全乡每个农民都在考虑和选择自己的道路。
    在这重要的时节，中共郑州地委派到土柏岗来的工作组的同志们不是更清醒地用阶级观点分析事实，掌握农民的具体思想，兢兢业业地进行工作，却盲目乐观起来了。他们没有深刻地体会毛主席的指示：“严重的问题是教育农民”，而把对农民进行社会主义改造看成轻而易举的事。他们喜欢在群众会上大声地说：“看谁走得最快呀！”“自发势力是死路一条！”
    于是全乡农民的百分之九十以上一阵风似地组织起来了，其中参加合作社或类似合作社形式的农户就占全乡总农户的百分之四十。全乡三十几户富农也大都被允许参加了互助合作组织，有些并且是乡干部羡慕他们有成套的牲口农具、或者有宗族和亲戚关系而请求他们进来的。
    很显然，这些参加合作社的农民，除少数干部、党员、团员和积极分子外，多数所谓“赶浪头”“看大势”的农民，特别是中农，是带有很大程度的盲目性的，甚至还有些是怕戴“自发势力”的帽子而进来的，他们仍然在注视着眼前所发生的事实来决定自己是继续前进还是后退。这个乡在宣传总路线以前，虽然经过了普选运动（它是全省最早的普选试点乡），农民有了一定的思想觉悟基础，但农业生产合作社还是第一次出现，既没有榜样，也缺乏经验。工作组的同志当时对这些情况和困难没有充分认识和估计，他们甚至把富农参加合作社也说是“工作先进的表现”。一种盲目自满的情绪，使工作组的同志不能切实理解党的积极领导稳步前进的办社方针和阶级政策，甚至觉得某些方针政策在这个乡里运用不上。
    全乡合作社的情况是很混乱的，社内的制度很多都不合乎依靠贫农、团结中农的政策。土地大都是按远低于实际产量的查田定产的标准定了等级；牲口农具作价有的过高，也有的过低；评工记分和分配制度一般的是亏了劳动力。例如乔振家所领导的“自发社”，土地不分好坏一律定为查田定产的二等地，劳力实行死分死记，土地劳力对半分红，而牲口饲料却又从劳力所得部分扣除。社员们满腹牢骚，劳动情绪低落。这些合作社中，后来经上级批准了四个为正式的，而另外还有十八个则是工作组既不否认它，也不积极领导它而长期让它去“自由发展”的所谓“自发社”。
    既没有旗帜，又缺乏经验，那么工作组就应该集中力量先办好一个重点社，创造经验，树立旗帜。但是，那个为全乡群众注视着的、党支部书记苏聚所领导的农业生产合作社却没有办好。苏聚曾勇敢地领导全乡群众走过了反封建的道路，但是他的保守自私的一面却随着他的经济生活的发展而发展着。工作组的同志对他的落后的一面是姑息、迁就的。今年麦季分红，他违背着领导方面的指示，实行了“一九分红”（劳一地九）。人民政府先后贷款扶持他的合作社打了四眼井，他们把井都打在社内做为副业生产的菜园地里去了；今秋社里的高粱、谷子却因为经不起干旱，加上遭了虫灾，减产了。他们组织了合作社，自发势力并没有停止发展；宣传总路线以后，仍然有富裕社员把贫困社员的粮食买过来囤积在自己手里。那个生活逐渐富裕起来的副社长苏全也越来越捣乱得厉害了，他存心不要合作社办好，他要“出社去做买卖”。因此群众对这个所谓“重点社”是冷淡的，甚至讥笑它。
    支部书记所领导的合作社是这样，这就不能不影响到全乡。乡里不论什么工作，尽管工作组想了一套计划，也尽管从党内到党外召开一系列的会议，却总是贯彻不下去，常常是会议开完了，工作也跟着就完了。
    宣传总路线以后，乡里仍然有三十多户地主、富农以及中农和富裕户放高利贷，而国家银行的干部却难于收回这个乡里的国家贷款。这个乡的粮食统购任务也是完成得不好的，工作组对那些不肯卖余粮的富裕户因为怕“刺激了他们的感情”而束手无策。
    “贫农出头露面，中农富农掌权”。这是这个乡里贫农的不满之声。贫农在这里似乎是“配角儿”，是仰着脸恳求别人帮忙的。既然贫农没有成为一种被依靠的力量，中农就离开了它；这样，也就没有形成贫农和中农的巩固联盟，而富农也就越来越嚣张了。富农对互助合作组织的分化瓦解作用越来越明显。在乡委员董建邦所领导的“自发社”（内有三户富农），当社员们商量同董景盛所领导的那个办得较好的合作社合并时，富农董景荣发言了：“董建邦，你是组长，你真的要领导着我们投降吗？”另一个富农董景福接上说：“别发迷啦，并社哩！在外面吃点喝点多自由，到社会主义你就做不得主了”。就这样，那些本想并社的贫农社员的社会主义觉悟的幼芽被摧残了。他们真的大吃大喝起来了。今年麦收前后三个月当中，全社十五户宰吃了两口猪。社里本来打算买一辆胶轮马车，也不买了，而把一千多万元分给各户随意去花消。另一个乡干部李文才领导的“自发社”，也是两户富农在背后掌权，当后来的工作组干部开始察觉到这种情况，但并不坚定地提出要把这两户富农清洗出去的时候，李文才着急了，他说：“叫他们出社我也出社”。
    中共郑州地委派了一个工作组在这里常驻，却长期没有到这个自己所掌握的重点乡切实检查工作；负有领导责任的中共开封县委认为土柏岗是地委的重点乡，就对它推托和放任。就这样，土柏岗的合作化运动从开始到现在还没有走上正路。现在，合作社大发展的浪潮就要来临了，土柏岗的互助合作运动却是沉寂的，支离破碎的。贫农在犹豫和苦闷，有的甚至追随着富农；许多中农扬言要出社了，他们不肯往地里上粪，有的把钱大部分用到盖新房上。中农刘银所领导的那个“自发社”，本来是因为“非走这条路不可，晚走不如早走”才组织起来的；而现在干部动员他们和别的“自发社”酝酿合并正式办社，他们却又摇头了。说：“再停一停吧”。过去曾一再要求正式办社的乔振家“自发社”，现在也表示要“维持现状”。他们说：“这样干着倒挺自由哩！”
    工作组的同志感到土柏岗的工作比“老牛拉破车”还要吃力，他们很苦恼。有的同志仍然没有弄清楚原因何在，他们希望能够找到一个“新办法”来扭转这种局势。事情是很显然的，如果仍然像过去那样不能以明确的社会主义思想领导和教育农民，仍然像过去那样离开党的“依靠贫农，巩固地团结中农，逐步地限制和消灭富农剥削”这一完整的阶级政策，那是不能希望找到什么“新办法”的。
