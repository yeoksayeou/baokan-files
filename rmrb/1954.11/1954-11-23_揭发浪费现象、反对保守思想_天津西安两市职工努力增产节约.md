Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, November 22nd: More than 100 units, including state-owned, locally state-owned, and jointly state-private factories and transportation departments in Tianjin, have universally revised their production increase and economy practice plans for this year based on mobilizing the masses of workers to oppose conservatism and waste. It is estimated that they can increase profits submitted to the state by 705 billion yuan for the entire year.

During the process of revising the production increase and economy practice plans, more than 20 factories under the Light Industry Management Department of the Tianjin Municipal Local State-owned Industry Bureau conducted detailed accounting and exposed wasteful phenomena in production. The Local State-owned People's Paper Mill No. 2 tapped the potential of its machinery, increased paper production, and saved materials, so that the profit submission plan for the fourth quarter could be raised. Sixteen units, including the State-owned Tianjin Steel Plant and the State-owned Tianjin Paper Mill, will also be able to submit more profits to the state for the whole year due to overcoming wasteful phenomena in materials and other aspects. In addition, some factories have solved the difficulty of insufficient raw material supply by researching and adopting substitutes, which will also increase a lot of wealth for the country.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, November 22nd: More than 20,000 workers in 35 factories and enterprises in Xi'an have joined the labor emulation drive.

Workers in various factories and enterprises enthusiastically responded to the call of the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and formulated technical and organizational measures to increase production and practice economy, further tapping the potential of the enterprises. Workers at the New Northwest Printing and Dyeing Factory studied and adopted many raw material substitutes and utilized waste and old materials under the principle of not affecting quality, greatly reducing production costs. Preliminary calculations show that production can be increased and 51.1 billion yuan can be saved in the fourth quarter. Workers at the First and Second Power Plants and various lines of the Xi'an Electric Power Bureau decided to reduce unit costs by 6.18% to 8.48% by reducing coal consumption and material consumption, disposing of stagnant materials, and accelerating capital turnover. Many factory workers have already achieved results in the labor emulation campaign, which mainly focuses on technological innovation. The Xi'an People's Flour Mill can now produce three taels more flour per bag. Workers at the Xi'an People's Enamel Factory have taken many measures to improve quality, and the percentage of qualified products has increased from 48% in the past to 62%, changing the situation that the quality plan had not been completed for a long time. The fly waste and silk waste of the Dahua Textile Factory have begun to decrease day by day, and the yarn breakage per thousand spindles per hour has also decreased from more than 110 to about 80. The amount of cotton used per piece of yarn has dropped to about 393 catties, creating a new record since the factory was built.

    揭发浪费现象、反对保守思想
    天津西安两市职工努力增产节约
    【新华社天津二十二日电】天津市国营、地方国营、公私合营工厂和交通运输部门等一百多个单位，在发动职工群众反保守、反浪费的基础上，普遍修订了今年的增产节约计划，全年可为国家增加上缴利润七千零五十亿元。
    天津市地方国营工业局轻工业管理处所属二十多个工厂在修订增产节约计划的过程中，进行了算细账和揭发了生产中的浪费现象。地方国营人民造纸二厂发挥机器的潜在能力，提高纸的产量，并节约材料，第四季度的上缴利润计划就可以提高。国营天津钢厂、国营天津造纸厂等十六个单位由于克服材料等方面的浪费现象，全年也可以为国家上缴更多利润。此外，有些工厂由于研究和采用了代用品，解决了原材料供应不足的困难，也将为国家增加很多财富。
      【新华社西安二十二日电】西安市已有三十五个工厂、企业的两万多职工投入了劳动竞赛。
    各工厂、企业职工热烈响应中共西安市委员会的号召，订出了增产节约的技术和组织措施，进一步发挥了企业的潜在能力。新西北印染厂职工研究在不影响质量的原则下，采用许多原料代用品，利用废料旧料，使生产成本大为降低。初步计算，第四季度可增产节约五十一亿一千多万元。西安电业局所属第一、二发电厂和各线路职工，决定用降低煤耗和材料消耗，处理呆滞材料、加速资金周转等办法，把单位成本降低百分之六点一八到百分之八点四八。许多工厂职工已经在以技术革新为主要内容的劳动竞赛中取得了成绩。西安人民面粉厂现在磨一袋面粉可多出三两面。西安人民搪瓷厂职工采取许多办法改进质量，正品率已由过去的百分之四十八提高到百分之六十二，改变了长期完不成质量计划的情况。大华纺织厂的回花、回丝已开始逐日减少，细纱千锭小时断头也由一百一十多根减少到八十根左右，每件纱的用棉量已经下降到三百九十三斤左右，创造了建厂以来的新纪录。
