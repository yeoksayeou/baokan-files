For the Motherland's "Granary"
    ——An Account of the Intense Labor of Changsha City搬運 Workers Transporting Lake Management Equipment
    Wang Yongrong

    In Mao Cao Street, Yuanjiang County, Hunan Province, where the Xiang, Zi, Yuan, and Li Rivers converge, more than 200,000 tons of materials and equipment are piled up like small mountains. Sailing boats and steamboats shuttle back and forth day and night, transporting them to various construction sites.

    Passing by here, one can often hear people's exclamations and praises.

    "Where did such a large amount of materials and equipment come from?"

    "Such thick and long *nanmu* bamboo! How sturdy and well-made the *yuanji* baskets are!"

    "The Communist Party and the People's Government really think of everything for us. As soon as the flood receded, the embankment repair materials were delivered!"

    Tens of thousands of farmers who had been relocated to mountainous and hilly areas, seeing or hearing about the arrival of so many embankment repair materials, returned to repair the embankments with their families and belongings, full of confidence.

    Materials, even if they arrive at the construction site a day or even an hour earlier, will give the three million farmers such comfort and encouragement!

    But how were these materials transported?

    On the hundreds of kilometers of the Yuehan and Xianggui railways, train cars fully loaded with engineering equipment were speeding towards Changsha Railway Station. On the two or three kilometers of streets from Changsha North Railway Station through the city to the wharves in the Xiangjiang New River area, more than 700 carts were running day and night, transporting 400,000 *nanmu* bamboo poles, 200,000 *dan* of *yuanji* baskets, and other large quantities of engineering equipment to the wharves in the New River area, and then transferred to wooden boats for transportation to the lake area construction sites.

    The night was as tense as the day. If you look at the wharves along the Xiangjiang River, countless electric lights emit brilliant light, shining brightly on the river surface; rows of sailing boats, fully loaded with *nanmu* bamboo, *yuanji* baskets, and other lake management engineering equipment, are speeding towards the South Dongting Lake and West Dongting Lake, more than 200 kilometers away. Immediately following, rows of sailing boats swiftly sail from the upper reaches of the Xiangjiang River to the wharves in the New River area, neatly arranged along the riverbank. At this time, the搬運 workers immediately jump onto the boats, tie up the *bangzi* (two boats tied side by side to form a pair), load the equipment, and pairs of sailing boats speed towards the construction site.

    Passing by the Xiangjiang New River wharf area, one can always hear the elderly people who have grown up here expressing their feelings: "In the Kuomintang era, when the lake area suffered a disaster, only batches of disaster victims fled to Changsha City. But this year, when the lake area suffered such a severe disaster, not only did we not see any disaster victims fleeing, but on the contrary, we only saw large numbers of boats transporting materials to the lake area."

    Walking into the office of the North District Service Station of the Changsha City搬運 Company's Bamboo and Wood Office,搬運 workers are constantly flowing in and out. Some of them have dark circles under their eyes, and some have red eyes, as if they haven't slept for several nights, but they don't show the slightest fatigue on their faces.

    On the walls are pasted guarantee letters written by搬運 workers in groups or individually. The words on those guarantee letters are sometimes missing a stroke, sometimes missing a dot, and some sentences are not very smooth. However, after reading those guarantee letters, one will feel a genuine emotion and strong strength, making people intimately understand their great desire to support the lake management project and restore the motherland's "granary." From the loudspeaker upstairs, the loud song "Workers Have Strength" is heard, and from time to time, the good news of a group or a worker once again improving work efficiency is announced.

    The more than 1,100搬運 workers participating in the Changsha City Bamboo and Wood Wharf搬運 of lake management engineering equipment mostly participated in the flood prevention and rescue work in the lake and river areas this year. They fought against the floods day and night for more than 50 days. Now, they are supporting the farmer brothers in repairing the dykes with even greater enthusiasm. Zhang Shaoan, of the 16th Brigade of the搬運 Team, received a letter from his wife a few days ago, asking him to go home no matter what to see his long-lost older sister. After reading the letter, he said: "I can't feel at ease going home until the work is finished. Let my wife entertain her at home! It won't be too late to go and see her after the work is completed."

    Chen Bin, a member of the Communist Youth League in the same team as Zhang Shaoan, his father died a few days ago, and there was no one to take care of the family. He asked for a day off to go home to take care of it, and returned to the construction site early the next morning to continue the intense搬運 work.

    The workers' enthusiasm for搬運 is very high, but this is the first time they have搬運 so many materials, especially搬運 such long *nanmu* bamboo, which is a very unfamiliar task for them. When loading *nanmu* bamboo, they cannot load it with just one wooden sailboat as they usually do. They must use two boats of the same length and height, tied together to form a pair. This is a new thing. At the beginning of the tying process, each technical team (ten or eleven people) could only tie an average of two pairs per day. Some groups even only tied one pair per day. At such a slow speed, it would be impossible to transport so many materials to the construction site before the dry season. Therefore, under the slogan of "fast loading, fast transportation, and fast unloading," they have risen up to tap potential and find tricks. The first technical team of the first squad of the seventh搬運 brigade came up with a "assembly line operation method" of division of labor and cooperation, which doubled work efficiency. Other technical teams have adopted this method and have also improved work efficiency.

    In the first squad of the搬運 team, there is a worker named Wang Jiming. Seeing that the workers were carrying the *nanmu* bamboo one by one from the wharf to the bottom of the wharf, the fastest average time was five minutes to carry one pole. Climbing up and down took a lot of time and was very tiring. He also saw that a lot of *nanmu* bamboo was piled up on the wharf, obstructing the passage of vehicles. Therefore, he suggested that the *nanmu* bamboo be transported to the wharf without dismantling it, and then the flatbed truck and the *nanmu* bamboo would be rolled down the slope of the wharf to the bottom of the wharf. This saves time, reduces the fatigue of the workers, and increases work efficiency by more than thirty times.

    The搬運 workers of the Changsha City Bamboo and Wood Wharf are搬運 the lake management equipment with such a pioneering spirit and selfless labor!

    The vast Dongting Lake management project is about to start in full swing. When the 700,000 migrant workers use these materials to repair the "granary," how happy it will be to think of the fields in the lake area growing yellow paddy fields next summer!

    为了祖国的“粮仓”
    ——记长沙市搬运工人搬运治湖器材的紧张劳动
    王永鎔
    在湘、资、沅、澧四水汇集的湖南省沅江县茅草街，二十多万吨物资器材堆积得像小山一样，帆船、轮船日夜不息，来回交错地向各处工地转运。
    路过这里，常常可听到人们的惊叹、赞美的声音。
    “从那里运来的这样多的物资器材？”
    “好粗、好长的楠竹！多结实、多精工的箢箕！”
    “共产党、人民政府真为我们想得周到，洪水刚退去，修堤的物资就运来了！”
    转移到山区、丘陵区的成千上万的农民们，看到或听到运来这样多的修堤物资，都满怀信心地携着家眷划着划子回来修堤了。
    物资，哪怕早一天，就是早一个小时运到工地，将会给三百多万农民何等的安慰和鼓舞啊！
    可是，这些物资是怎样运来的呢？
    几百公里的粤汉、湘桂铁路线上，满载着工程器材的车皮，急速地向长沙市火车站奔驶着。从长沙火车北站通过市区往湘江新河一带码头的两三公里的街道上，七百多辆板车日夜不息，一车接一车地把四十万根楠竹，二十万担箢箕以及其他大批工程器材运到新河一带的码头上去，然后改装木船，运往湖区工地。
    夜里和白天一样的紧张。如果你走到湘江的码头上一望，那十里长的江边，无数盏电灯，发出灿烂的光芒，辉煌地照耀在江面上；那一排一排的帆船，满载着楠竹、箢箕等治湖工程器材，急速地向着二百多公里远的南洞庭湖和西洞庭湖驶去。紧接着，又一排一排的帆船火速地从湘江上游驶向新河一带的码头来，整整齐齐的排列在江岸。这时，搬运工人们，马上跳上船去，扎好帮子（两只船并排扎成一对），装上器材，又一对一对的帆船急速向工地驶去。
    路过湘江新河码头一带，可随时听到那些从小就生长在这里的老年人在发表着自己的感想：“在国民党时代，湖区遭了灾，只见那一批一批的灾民逃往长沙市来。可是今年湖区遭了这样重的灾，不但见不到灾民逃来，相反的，只见到大批大批的船装运物资往湖区去。”
    走进长沙市搬运公司竹木办事处北区服务站的办公室，搬运工人们川流不息地进出着，他们有的眼眶有些发黑，有的眼珠已经发红，好像有几夜没有睡觉了，但面上却显不出来丝毫的倦容。
    墙壁上贴着搬运工人们以小组或个人写来的保证书，那保证书上的字，有的多了一撇，有的少了一点，有些语句也不很通顺。可是，看完了那些保证书以后，会给人们一种真实的感情和坚强的力量，使人们亲切地了解他们支援治湖工程，修复祖国“粮仓”的伟大心愿。楼上的扩音器里，传出响亮的“咱们工人有力量”的歌声，也不时传出一个小组和一个工人又一次提高了工作效率的捷报。
    参加长沙市竹木码头搬运治湖工程器材的一千一百多搬运工人，大部分是参加过今年滨湖沿江地区的防汛抢险工作的，他们五十多天，夜以继日地和洪水搏斗过，现在，他们又以更高的热情，支援农民兄弟修复垸堤。搬运队第十六大队的张少安，前几天，接到老婆从家里来信，要他无论如何回家一趟，看一看他多年不见的亲姐姐。他看完信后说：“工作不完，哪能放心去，让老婆在家里招待吧！工作完成了，再去看也不迟。”
    和张少安同一个队里的青年团员陈斌，前几天，他的父亲死了，家里无人照料，他请一天假回家料理一下，第二天一早就赶回工地来，继续紧张地搬运着。
    工人们搬运的情绪是很高的，但是，他们第一次搬运这样多的器材，特别是搬运那样长的楠竹，对他们是一件很生疏的工作。在装运楠竹上，他们不能像平时那样以一只木帆船来装运，必须用两只同样长短，同样高低的船并扎成一对帮子。这是一个新事情，开始绑扎时，每个技术小组（十人，或十一人），平均每天只能扎两对，有的组，甚至一天才扎一对。以这样慢的速度，要使这样多的器材在枯水以前赶运到工地上去，那是不可能的。因此，他们在“快装、快运、快卸”的口号下，纷纷起来挖潜力，找窍门。第七搬运大队第一分队第一技术小组，想出了一种分工合作的“流水作业法”，使工作效率提高一倍。其他队的技术小组，有人采用了这种方法，也都提高了工作效率。
    在搬运队第一分队里，有个名叫汪基明的工人，看到工人们把楠竹一根一根的从码头上背到码头下，最快的平均也要五分钟背一根。爬上爬下，化了很多时间，而且很累人。他又看到码头上堆积了很多的楠竹，阻碍汽车通行。于是，他建议把楠竹运到码头上来，不要拆散，随即把板车与楠竹一起从码头的斜坡上滚滑到码头下。这样，既节省了时间，又减少了工人的疲劳，因而提高工作效率三十倍以上。
    长沙市竹木码头的搬运工人，就是以这样的首创的精神，忘我的劳动来搬运治湖器材的！
    浩大的洞庭湖治理工程，马上就要全面动工了，当那七十万民工使用这些器材，修复“粮仓”的时候，想到明年夏天，湖滨地区的田园里，长着一片一片黄甸甸的稻谷，该是多么愉快啊！
