Local People's Procuratorates across the country have conducted typical experiments in procuratorial work in many places. These typical experiments are being carried out in accordance with the formal procuratorial business system, and procuratorial cadres have gained a lot of experience in the experiments.

According to statistics, there are currently 155 typical pilot projects for procuratorial work across the country, with 1,554 procuratorial cadres participating in the typical experiments. These typical experimental works were started after the Second National Procuratorial Work Conference held in March this year. Through the typical experimental work, many regions have begun to formulate procedures and methods for various procuratorial businesses, and have improved the business level and work ability of cadres.

The procuratorial organs conducting typical experiments closely contacted and cooperated with relevant departments such as the People's Courts and public security organs, significantly improving the quality of case handling and work efficiency, and preventing and reducing the occurrence of wrong cases. Procuratorial organs in Changchun, Guangzhou, Beijing, Shanxi, and Dingxian County in Hebei Province, etc., received 582 cases submitted by public security organs for review of arrest and prosecution during the trial implementation of the investigation supervision system. During the review by the procuratorial organs, some cases with insufficient evidence or lack of evidence were returned to the public security organs for supplementary investigation, thereby accurately combating criminal acts and protecting the democratic rights of the people. Adopting formal systems for handling cases in the experiment made the pursuit of criminal facts more accurate. For example, in the case of Li Shouzhen's rape and murder in Minqin County, Gansu Province, after joint investigation by the People's Procuratorate and the People's Court, the People's Court was preparing to sentence the murderer to death, but the case had not been concluded for a long time because the defendant recanted. After the procuratorial organ used the method of collecting evidence in accordance with the formal system, it not only clarified the original criminal facts, but also discovered new criminal evidence. Finally, the defendant had to plead guilty in the face of irrefutable evidence and witnesses.

The pilot work in various places is closely integrated with the central work of the local area. During the flood season, the Wuhan Municipal Procuratorate investigated 20 cases of sabotaging flood control, which boosted the people's confidence in overcoming floods. The Shenyang Municipal Procuratorate seized a major personal injury and death accident case in a smelting plant, exposing the defendant's violation of operating procedures and causing significant losses to the state, which provided a profound education for representatives of more than 60 factory workers who attended the court hearing. Some workers who were unwilling to use safety belts in the past automatically used safety belts after attending the trial of the case. He Jingfu, a reactionary rich peasant in Renhe Village, Shuangcheng County, Heilongjiang Province, stole the position of deputy director of the cooperative, which led to the squeezing out of poor farmers, internal disunity, and continuous demands from members to withdraw from the cooperative, seriously affecting production. After investigation and prosecution by the county procuratorial organ, the court imposed legal sanctions on He, and the production enthusiasm of the members was rapidly improved. The purchase cloth coupons issued by the Commercial Department of the Henan Provincial People's Government violated the regulations on the use period of cloth tickets in the planned purchase and planned supply of cotton cloth by the former Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government. The Zhengzhou Municipal Procuratorate immediately reported to the Provincial Procuratorate to file a protest with the Commercial Department. The Commercial Department then published a statement correcting the error, recovering the adverse effects and losses caused by the illegal measures. (Xinhua News Agency)

    各地人民检察机关进行检察工作典型试验
    全国各地人民检察机关在许多地方进行了检察工作的典型试验。这种典型试验是按照正规的检察业务制度进行的，检察干部已在试验中取得了很多经验。
    根据统计，目前全国检察工作的典型试点有一百五十五个，参加典型试验的检察干部有一千五百五十四名。这些典型试验工作都是在今年三月召开的第二届全国检察工作会议以后开始进行的。通过典型试验工作，许多地区已着手制订各项检察业务的程序和办法，并提高了干部的业务水平和工作能力。
    进行典型试验的检察机关和人民法院、公安机关等有关部门密切联系、互相配合，显著地提高了办案质量和工作效率，并防止和减少了错案的发生。长春、广州、北京、山西和河北省的定县等检察机关，在试行侦查监督制度中，收到公安机关移送审查的逮捕和起诉的案件五百八十二件，检察机关在审查中，对于一些证据不足或缺乏证据的案件都退回公安机关作了补充侦查，这样就准确地打击了犯罪行为和保护了人民的民主权利。在试验中采取正规制度办理案件，对犯罪事实的追究也更加准确。如甘肃省民勤县李守珍奸杀案，经过人民检察机关和人民法院共同调查，人民法院准备对凶手判处死刑，但因被告翻供，很久没有结案；经过检察机关按照正规制度用收集证据的方法，不仅查清了原犯罪事实，并且还发现了新的犯罪证据。最后被告人在铁的人证、物证面前只得低头认罪。
    各地的试点工作都是密切结合当地的中心工作进行的。武汉市检察机关在防汛时期，检察了破坏防汛的案件二十起，提高了人民群众战胜洪水的信心。沈阳市检察机关抓住冶炼厂重大人身伤亡事故案件，揭发了被告人违反操作规程，给国家造成重大损失的罪行，使参加法庭旁听的六十多个工厂职工的代表受到一次深刻的教育。过去有些不肯使用安全带的工人，在旁听了审判案件后，都自动地使用了安全带。黑龙江省双城县仁和村反动富农何景富窃取了合作社副主任的职位，使贫苦农户受到排挤，社内闹不团结，社员不断要求退社，严重影响了生产。后经县检察机关侦查起诉，由法院给予何犯以法律制裁，社员的生产积极性迅速提高。河南省人民政府商业厅印发的购布证，违背了前中央人民政府政务院关于棉布计划收购和计划供应中布票使用期限的规定，郑州市检察机关即报请省检察机关向商业厅提出抗议，商业厅随即登报声明纠正，挽回了由于违法措施所造成的不良影响和损失。（新华社）
