What is Hindering the Completion of Commercial Plans

By our reporter An Gang

    One month of the fourth quarter of 1954 has passed. Comrades in the commercial departments of the Northeast region are working hard to complete and overfulfill the state plan. Most comrades are conscientious and hardworking, determined to "guarantee the overfulfillment of the fourth quarter plan and strive to complete the annual plan." However, some comrades have shown a lack of confidence and little enthusiasm. At a meeting of commercial department and bureau directors in the Liaoning region hosted by the Northeast Commercial Bureau, some comrades dared not even propose the slogan of completing the annual plan. Recently, at a meeting of city and county commercial departments in Heilongjiang Province, some also expressed that they did not dare to propose the struggle goal of striving to complete the fourth quarter plan.

    Why do these comrades lack confidence in completing the state plan? It is said that the main reason is that many regions or departments failed to complete their plans in the second and third quarters. The Northeast region's sales plan in the third quarter averaged 91.1 percent of the state quarterly plan, with a cumulative completion of 64.2 percent of the annual plan. According to general principles, since the plan completion was not good in the second and third quarters, it should be actively strived to complete and overfulfill the fourth quarter plan to make up for the tasks not completed in the past. This is completely appropriate and without any doubt. However, some comrades have a strange logic: they believe that "since the plan was not completed in the second and third quarters of this year, it is unavoidable that the annual plan cannot be completed," and "the failure to complete the plan this year was affected by objective conditions." Therefore, they rarely consider the issue from the perspective of ensuring the completion of the plan. They think, "Anyway, the plan cannot be completed, so there is no way to do it even if we work harder," and thus adopt an attitude of "more fleas don't itch, more debts don't worry." Some comrades only look for reasons and causes for "not completing the plan" and do not think of solutions from a positive perspective. The question now is: should we allow the influence of objective conditions, let time pass in vain, and let a "failure to complete the plan" result naturally occur? Or should we start by strengthening subjective efforts, not only resolutely completing but also striving to overfulfill the plan? Comrades who hold the latter attitude are full of confidence and strength, while those who hold the former attitude shout "there is no way to complete the plan" but do not really take action.

    Currently, the biggest obstacle preventing people from completing and overfulfilling commercial plans is the negative thinking of simply complaining about objective difficulties, which exists in some comrades. This kind of thinking was not obvious when various regions basically completed their plans in the first quarter. Starting from the second quarter, when completing the task became somewhat difficult, some people repeatedly proposed the requirement to revise the state plan. The Ministry of Commerce, proceeding from the overall interests of the country, did not approve this requirement. However, these comrades did not dispel their ideas because of this. After the situation of not completing the plan in the third quarter was determined, this sentiment played a dominant role to some extent.

    If we specifically analyze these thoughts and emotions, they are generally manifested in the following aspects:

    Some people believe that the estimated purchasing power this year is higher than the actual purchasing power, and the composition of market purchasing power has also changed, which is the main reason for not completing the plan. But can these be used as the basis for not completing the plan? This is very doubtful.

    Looking at the first half of this year, the increase in purchasing power in the Northeast region is not small. According to statistics from the Northeast Commercial Bureau, the purchasing power of the entire region increased by 11.3 percent compared to the same period last year, accounting for 45.2 percent of the annual purchasing power. The state-owned commercial system completed 109 percent of the first half-year plan for purchases and 95.4 percent of the sales plan. Judging from the current materials, although the estimated purchasing power for the whole year is about 1.7 percent higher than the actual purchasing power, the crops in the Northeast region have not suffered any disasters this year, and there has been great development in industrial and agricultural production, so there are still favorable conditions for completing the fourth quarter plan.

    It should be admitted that the change in the composition of purchasing power is indeed a fact. The most significant changes are the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement, with farmers buying more new agricultural tools and other means of production. In cities, the proportion of purchases of non-staple foods has increased, while the proportion of purchases of department stores and staple foods has decreased. For example, in the first quarter of Harbin, department stores accounted for 50.7 percent of the city's total retail sales, a decrease of 3.6 percent compared to the same period last year, non-staple foods accounted for 23.2 percent, an increase of 5.2 percent compared to the same period last year, and staple foods accounted for 26.1 percent, a decrease of 1.6 percent compared to the same period last year. However, the absolute sales volume of department stores still increased by 16.4 percent compared to the same period last year. From this situation, we can see that the claim that "changes in the composition of purchasing power hinder the completion of commercial plans" is unfounded.

    The fourth quarter is the last and busiest season of the year. We should not focus our main efforts on whether there has been a change in purchasing power. We should concentrate our efforts on finding ways to complete the plan. This is our current urgent task. As for carefully investigating purchasing power in order to better supply the needs of the market, this is the regular task of state-owned commerce.

    Some people say: "In previous years, social purchasing power was high in the third quarter, so the plan was completed better than in the first and second quarters. This year, this pattern has changed and is unpredictable." Has the pattern changed? This is a question that can be discussed for a quarter. But there is one pattern that will not change under any circumstances: the greater our subjective efforts, the better the completion of the plan. In order to illustrate this point, it is necessary to cite the situation of the department store, transportation and electrical appliance, and hardware systems, which have had relatively poor plan completion. From the perspective of the department store system, after the implementation of planned supply of cotton cloth, due to reasonable allocation, there will be no over-planned supply in the market this year, which is completely understandable. However, some commercial workers mistakenly regard planned supply as "the less we sell, the better," passively treating the work of planned supply and not actively completing sales tasks according to the plan. On the other hand, we must also see that cotton cloth is only one kind of commodity. Within the department store system, there are at least tens of thousands of commodities that are not subject to planned supply, many of which are necessities of people's lives. Why have sales plans not been completed either? If we examine it from subjective efforts, we will find some problems. According to statistics from Shenyang Department Store, the actual sales volume in the third quarter of this year decreased by 6 percent compared to the sales volume in the same period last year, but the inventory at the end of September increased by 17.39 percent compared to the same period last year. The decrease in sales volume is inversely proportional to the increase in inventory. This is related to the fact that many staff members neglect counter retail, and there are some shortcomings in commodity display, counter hygiene, and service attitude, as well as simply complaining about the large inventory and not actively trying to promote sales.

    From the perspective of the transportation and electrical appliance system, the most inventory and capital tied up is in diesel vehicles, tires, and wires. Is the accumulation of diesel vehicles an "objective reason"? Shenyang Transportation and Electrical Appliance Company only promoted five D350 trucks in the first half of this year. The comrades of the company said: "People like gasoline vehicles and do not like diesel vehicles." In fact, they did not actively try to promote sales from a subjective point of view. The company and the store did not pay attention to the maintenance of diesel vehicles. Some vehicles had damaged paint and were not repaired, and the toolkits were short of parts and were not replenished for customers. New vehicles were not charged or filled with oil, and customers were not allowed to choose when buying vehicles. These practices hindered sales to varying degrees. What is especially important is that they gave up on promoting the performance of the products. Diesel vehicles have a large load capacity and low fuel cost, which is very suitable for our current needs. However, because many drivers are not familiar with the performance of diesel vehicles and find it difficult to start, they prefer to buy gasoline vehicles rather than diesel vehicles. This can be persuaded. In September of this year, the Shenyang Municipal People's Government held a meeting of factories and mines to promote the benefits of large diesel vehicles, and two vehicles were sold the next day. Unfortunately, some comrades were not interested in this situation. A section chief of the planning and statistics department of the transportation and electrical appliance company still blamed the accumulation of diesel vehicles on "the climate in Northeast China being too cold." Looking at their plan and statistics work summary, it becomes even clearer. One of the conclusions of the summary is: "If the commodity sales composition remains unchanged, that is, if the commodity composition that accounted for a very large proportion last year does not decrease this year, the sales volume will change greatly. We assume that: as long as tires, rubber wires, electric motors, and transformers can maintain the level of last year, our net sales plan for the first quarter can be completed by 105 percent, and the net sales plan for the second quarter can also be overfulfilled by 1.3 percent." However, the problem is that this kind of plan analysis is not based on reality, but is based on "if" and "assumptions." Therefore, the conclusion can only be: "There is nothing I can do if this year is not as good as last year." These comrades want the market to not change at all, but they do not analyze the market production and sales situation, nor do they conduct in-depth investigation and analysis of major commodities. This cannot but make their work lag behind the actual needs. Some commodities (such as Shanghai wires and iron pipes, and Soviet new-standard wires) can be sold in other places. Why can't they be sold in some areas of Northeast China? This is not a "change in sales composition," but a lack of initiative in serving the cause of production by some people in the commercial department. They have not strengthened contact with factories, mines, and technical design departments, deeply studied commodity performance, opened up the minds of salespersons, and reversed the thinking of user units. Facts in various places have proved that as long as the above work is done effectively, sales will definitely open up. The idea of simply complaining about "changes in commodity sales composition" is one-sided. They have not seen the other side, that is, with the development of national production, the expansion of capital construction, and the increase in the circulation of transportation and electrical equipment commodities. According to statistics from Shenyang Transportation and Electrical Appliance Company, the market sales volume of transportation and electrical products in the first half of 1954 increased by 7.41 percent compared to the same period in 1953. This shows that the sales volume of a certain commodity (such as tires) may decrease, but as long as we expand the variety of operations, we will definitely strive to increase the total sales volume.

    Hardware equipment companies also have similar phenomena. For example, the carbide tools of the Shenyang Machine Tool Store are very much needed by factories, but they cannot be bought in the retail department, but there is inventory in the warehouse. Can these responsibilities be pushed to "changes in purchasing power or sales volume"? Obviously, this should not be the case. The commercial department should check the problems existing in serving production and serving people's consumption, and give play to potential strength. In this way, the enthusiasm of the employees will be mobilized to overcome all obstacles on the road ahead. In short, what should be studied now is how to seize the opportunity to complete the sales task, and not to talk emptily about "changes in purchasing power." The better we complete the task, the more likely we are to draw correct conclusions about changes in purchasing power.

    Some people believe that "the state has strengthened the planning of internal allocation of certain materials, thus making it impossible for us to complete the plan." It is true that the internal allocation of materials has expanded, which will affect the business plans of the hardware and transportation and electrical appliance companies to a certain extent. However, it should be recognized that the strengthening of the planning of internal allocation by the state is a good and inevitable phenomenon, indicating that our national life is increasingly moving towards planned leadership. The state's implementation of internal allocation can more flexibly and closely guarantee the needs of production and construction, so as not to turn a large number of means of production into commodities accumulated in stores, as in 1951, which affected the needs of construction. The commercial plan of the Northeast region this year has estimated the factors of the expansion of state allocation. However, some comrades in the commercial department equate the state's internal allocation with the subjective efforts that should be made. They have not worked well to adapt to the characteristics of the state's strengthening of planning. Some people even think that we are only "making up for the deficiency" and "have nothing to do." In fact, there are too many things that should be done, but have not been done or have not been done well. Because state allocation only accounts for a small part, most of the materials allocated by the state are not in the inventory of the store. It does not hinder the normal supply of the store. For example, indoor electrical materials, which are not in the planned allocation, accounted for only 3.7 percent of the total net sales in 1953, while the proportion has risen to 9.01 percent from January to August this year. This is due to the needs of installation projects after the completion of capital construction, the construction and renovation of urban housing. It has been raised to the first place in the planned varieties of the transportation and electrical system except for automobiles. Doesn't this show that there are many things to do? With the strengthening of the planning of the state's internal allocation, the commercial department should strengthen its initiative even more. The ideological style of "selling what we have, and forgetting about it if we don't have it" and "anyway, these are the specifications, take it or leave it" is the biggest obstacle to completing the task. The contact between stores and industrial and mining enterprises in many areas is not good, and they cannot supply the needs of production in a timely and sufficient manner. Shenyang Hardware Company signed a contract with the Mining Machinery Factory to purchase ball bearings, but could not supply them all on time. Some places purchased a large number of defective products regardless of specifications and quality, which were forced to be returned and reworked, which affected the production units that purchased them. This year, the plain white iron and corrugated iron supplied by Shenyang Hardware Company were out of stock. Later, it was found that these materials were in stock in brother companies in Changchun, Jilin, and Harbin, but the business department did not contact these units. If we compare the losses caused by these shortcomings in work with the reduction in commercial income due to the state's allocation of materials, we can see that the main reason for affecting the completion of the plan is the former, and the latter only accounts for a small proportion. This shows the practical significance of subjectively striving to open up new paths.

    Some people believe that "the state plan is too large," and thus have a negative attitude towards completing the plan. It should be admitted that the actual situation may not have been fully estimated when formulating plans in some regions and departments this year, and there may be some bias. This should be used by the subjective efforts of all employees on the commercial front to find out the scientific basis for compiling plans from practice in order to do a good job in planning next year. The question now is: what attitude should be used to treat the state plan? Is it a positive attitude of resolutely completing the plan with the greatest effort? Or is it a negative attitude? How much bigger is the commercial plan of the Northeast region this year? It is understood that this year's plan was basically proposed by various places and approved by the higher authorities. Judging from the historical situation, the plan in the past was generally underestimated. For example, the commercial plan of Shenyang City in 1953 was increased by the higher authorities, and it was still overfulfilled in the end. This is the general situation. This year, the higher authorities did not increase the planned tasks. The plan currently being implemented in the Northeast region has been reduced by 6.5 percent compared to the plan stipulated for the whole year. The fourth quarter plan does not include the task figures that were left behind in the first three quarters, and it is also somewhat lower than the figures that should be completed in the fourth quarter. The provinces and cities in the Northeast have sufficient possibilities to complete the plan, and should also complete a higher planned task, because the proportion of retail sales in the sales volume of the Northeast region is greater than that of other parts of the country, the traffic is smooth, the transportation is convenient, and the freight is lower. The agricultural products this year are not lower than last year. However, people who shout "the plan is too big" have not considered these actual conditions, and strive to actively complete and overfulfill the plan to support the disaster-stricken areas of the country. Some leading cadres see the comrades below shouting "the plan is too big," and they also blindly shout. The former Liaodong Provincial Commercial Department left 89.3 billion yuan of sales tasks in the third quarter without arranging them downwards. It is doubtful whether all of them cannot be realized. The manager of the Shuangcheng County Coal Construction Company in Heilongjiang Province went to a meeting at the provincial company. He completed the least of the plan for a certain commodity he sold, and was even praised by the manager of the provincial company at the meeting. This unserious attitude towards the state plan has encouraged the liberal attitude of the lower levels in completing the plan. Many companies and stores do not understand that the commodity circulation plan approved by the higher authorities is a concentrated expression of the leading role of state-owned commerce in the entire market. It has the nature of state law and must be resolutely implemented, rather than asking the higher authorities to revise it as soon as difficulties are encountered. Some people unilaterally emphasize that only continuous revision can make the plan tend to reality, but they do not understand what is meant by "reality." The plan should conform to reality, which is correct, but this reality is not obtained by itself, let alone a conservative and backward thing that can be obtained without effort. The reality we are referring to should be an average advanced one, so that it can guide the masses, change the status quo, and mobilize the masses to make greater efforts.

    Some people believe that "there are too many central tasks in the commercial system," which is the main reason for not completing the plan. It should be admitted that the work undertaken by the commercial department this year is arduous. Over the year, state-owned commerce has undertaken tasks such as planned procurement, planned supply, socialist transformation of private commerce, and adjustment of the division of labor between state-owned commerce and cooperatives. These tasks should not be regarded as burdens, but should be regarded as strengthening the leading role of state-owned commerce in the market under the correct policy leadership of the Party. State-owned commerce should shoulder the responsibility of planning and arranging the domestic market and become the leading and guiding force of national commercial activities. Can we relax the purchasing and sales work of state-owned commerce because our responsibilities have increased? This should not be the case. Expanding the promotion of state-owned commerce is consistent with expanding the circulation of social commodities as a whole. According to reports from various places, some provinces in the Northeast region have neglected promotion work to varying degrees in the commercial work of the first, second, and third quarters of this year. Dalian City is a place where state-owned commerce has completed its plan well. According to the responsible comrades of the city's commercial bureau, they also neglected promotion work to varying degrees during this period. Some comrades do not understand that only by strengthening the leadership of state-owned commerce over the market, vigorously supporting industrial and agricultural production, and meeting the needs of consumers, and ensuring the completion of purchasing and sales plans and financial plans, can we strengthen and consolidate the leading force and smoothly arrange and lead the entire commercial activity. State-owned commerce must play a leading role, and at the same time, strive to complete the annual purchasing and sales plans and financial plans. All work should revolve around this regular central task. The current problem is not that there is a contradiction between the so-called central work and daily work, because there is no central work without daily work. Today, what is more serious is that in many places, there is still a lack of active actions and serious and in-depth work in mobilizing and organizing all forces to ensure the completion of the annual commercial purchasing and sales plan. The leading comrades of the commercial departments of the provinces, cities, and counties basically spent the first month (October) of the fourth quarter in a series of large and small meetings. Many of the meetings were actually just bargaining and did little to actually complete the plan. Now time is tight and waits for no one. Meetings should be reduced, and efforts should be put into practical work, specifically helping the grassroots work, strengthening ideological work, overcoming wrong ideas in a timely manner, and strengthening inspection and supervision work in many ways.

    What is hindering the completion of the commercial plan? It should be affirmed that subjective negative thinking and various erroneous views that are incompatible with socialist commercial management thinking are the main reasons affecting the completion of the annual plan. The claim that responsibility is pushed to objective reasons can only indicate that it is bowing to objective difficulties. The commercial departments of various places in the Northeast have begun to pay attention to reversing some wrong ideas. It is hoped that in the tense work of completing the annual plan, political and ideological work will be seriously strengthened, and the struggle against all negative and passive thoughts and emotions will be resolutely carried out. Political work should guide people to learn from the advanced, and should guide people not only to see the difficulties, but also to recognize the favorable conditions for completing the plan. The fourth quarter is a busy season. This year, the state is centrally purchasing in rural areas, and the quantity and variety of commodities are more than last year. Rural production cooperatives and winter sideline production will have greater development. The ordering of basic construction departments in 1955 has also begun. These favorable conditions have brought great possibilities for completing the annual plan. Therefore, we must politically mobilize and organize all employees to complete the national plan with full confidence in the end, vigorously carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy, and encourage and support all advanced experiences in the movement. As long as we give full play to subjective initiative, mobilize all potential forces to contribute to the completion of the annual plan, it will inevitably narrow and even overcome objective difficulties, thereby ensuring the completion of the annual plan and laying a good foundation for the work in 1955.

    什么东西阻碍着商业计划的完成
    本报记者　安岗
    一九五四年第四季度过去一个月了。东北地区商业部门的同志正在努力争取完成和超额完成国家计划。大多数同志都是兢兢业业，努力工作，决心“保证超额完成第四季度计划，争取完成全年计划。”但有一部分同志却表现了信心不足，劲头不大。在东北商业局主持的辽宁地区商业厅、局长会议上，有的同志竟不敢提出完成全年计划的口号；最近在黑龙江省召开的市县商业部门的会议上，也有人表示不敢提出努力完成第四季度计划的奋斗目标。
    为什么这些同志完成国家计划的信心不足呢？据说主要是因为第二、三季度有不少地区或部门没有完成计划。东北区第三季度销售计划平均完成了国家季度计划的百分之九十一点一，累计完成全年计划的百分之六十四点二。按一般道理来讲，既然今年第二、三季度完成计划不好，那就应该积极努力完成和超额完成第四季度计划，弥补过去没有完成的任务，这是完全应该而且丝毫没有疑问的。但是个别同志却有一个奇怪的逻辑，他们认为“今年第二、三季度既没有完成计划，完不成全年计划已无法避免”，“今年完不成计划是受了客观条件的影响”。因此，他们很少从保证完成计划这方面来考虑问题。他们认为“反正计划是完不成了，再努力也没办法”，因而抱着一种“虱多不咬，债多不愁”的态度，有些同志只是去找“完不成计划”的理由和原因，根本不从积极方面想办法。现在的问题是：听任客观条件的影响，让时间白白过去，自流地出现一个“完不成计划”的结果呢？还是从加强主观努力入手、不但要坚决完成而且还要争取超额完成计划呢？抱着后一种态度的同志是充满信心和力量的，而抱着前一种态度的人却叫喊“没有办法完成计划”，自己却不去真正动手。
    目前妨碍人们完成和超额完成商业计划最大的原因是存在于一些同志身上的单纯埋怨客观困难的消极思想。这种思想在第一季度各地基本完成计划的情况下是表现得不明显的。从第二季度开始，当时完成任务有些吃力，于是就有人一再提出修改国家计划的要求；商业部从全国的整体利益出发，没有批准这种要求；但这些同志并未因此打消自己的念头，到第三季度完不成计划的局面确定以后，这种情绪就在某种程度上起了支配作用。
    如果具体地分析这些思想情绪，大体上表现为以下几个方面：
    有人认为：今年预计的购买力比实际购买力高，市场购买力的组成又发生了变化，这是完不成计划的主要原因。但这些是否就可以作为完不成计划的根据呢？这是很值得怀疑的。
    从今年上半年来看，东北地区购买力上升幅度并不小。据东北商业局统计，今年上半年全区购买力比去年同期增长百分之十一点三，占全年购买力的百分之四十五点二；国营商业系统购进计划完成上半年计划的百分之一百零九，销售计划完成百分之九十五点四。从目前的材料来看，全年预计的购买力虽比实际购买力高百分之一点七左右，但今年东北地区的农作物没有遭受什么灾害，工农业生产有很大发展，完成第四季度计划仍是有着有利条件的。
    应当承认，购买力的组成正在变化确是事实，最显著的如农村互助合作化，农民更多地购买新式农具等生产资料；在城市，购买副食的比重上升，购买百货和主食的比重下降。如哈尔滨市第一季度全市零售额中，百货占百分之五十点七，比去年同期下降百分之三点六，副食占百分之二十三点二，比去年同期上升百分之五点二，主食占百分之二十六点一，比去年同期下降百分之一点六。但百货绝对销售额和去年同时相比，仍然上升了百分之十六点四。从这个情况中，我们可以看到那种认为“购买力组成变化，妨碍完成商业计划”的说法是没有根据的。
    第四季度是全年最后的也是最旺的一季，我们不应该把主要的力量放在购买力是否有了变化这个事实上，我们应当集中力量寻找完成计划的途径，这是我们当前的紧迫任务。至于认真调查购买力，以便更好地供应市场的需要，这是国营商业经常的任务。
    有人说：“往年第三季度社会购买力高，因此计划完成的比第一、第二季度好，今年这个规律改变了，不可捉摸。”是不是规律改变了呢？这是可以花上一个季度去讨论的问题。但有一个规律是在任何情况下也不会改变的，这就是：我们主观努力越大，完成计划越好。为了说明这一点，引证完成计划较差的百货、交通电器、五金等系统的情况是有必要的。从百货系统看，棉布实行计划供应后，由于合理的分配结果，今年市场上将不可能有超计划供应的现象，这是完全可以理解的。但是，有些商业工作者却错误地把计划供应看作是“越少卖越好”，消极地对待计划供应的工作，不积极地按计划完成销货任务。另外一方面，我们还要看到，棉布只是商品的一种，在百货公司系统内至少有上万种商品并没有实行计划供应，其中有不少都是人民生活的必需品，为什么也没有完成销售计划呢？如果从主观的努力上来检查就会发现一些问题。据沈阳市百货公司统计，今年第三季度实际销售额较去年同期销售额下降百分之六，但九月末库存却较去年同期增大了百分之十七点三九，今年上半年每人每月平均卖钱额较去年同期降低百分之六点二。卖钱额的下降同库存的增加适成反比例，这和不少工作人员忽视柜台零售，在商品陈列、柜台卫生、服务态度上都存有若干缺点，以及单纯埋怨库存大，不去积极设法推销有关的。
    从交通电器系统来看，它们积压占用资金最多的是柴油汽车、轮带和电线等。柴油车的积压是不是“客观原因”呢？沈阳市交电公司今年上半年只推销了D350卡车五台。公司同志说：“人们喜欢汽油车，不喜欢柴油车”，实际是他们没有从主观上想办法积极推销。公司和商店对柴油车的保养工作不注意，有的车漆皮破损，也不去修理，随车工具短缺也不替顾客补配，新车不给充电带油，买车时不准挑选，这些作法都或多或少地妨害了销售。尤其重要的是他们放弃了对商品性能的宣传。柴油汽车载重能力大，油贱，很适合我们目前的需要，但因不少司机不熟悉柴油车性能，嫌它发动费力，都愿买汽油车而不愿买柴油车。这是可以说服的。今年九月份沈阳市人民政府召开厂矿会议，宣传大柴油车的好处，第二天就卖出了两台。很可惜的是某些同志对这个情况不感兴趣，跟我谈话的一位交电公司计划统计科科长仍然把柴油汽车积压归罪于“东北气候太冷”。再看看他们的计划统计工作总结就更明白了，总结的结论之一是：“如果商品销售构成不变，也就是如果在去年占比重极大的商品构成在本年不降低条件下，则销售额将大大改变。我们这样假定：轮胎、皮线、电动机、变压器只要能保持去年的水平，则第一季度我们的纯销计划可完成百分之一百零五，第二季度纯销计划也能超额百分之一点三”。可是问题就在于这种计划的分析不是建立在现实基础上，而是以“如果”和“假定”来作依据的，因此结论也就只能是：“今年不如去年岂奈我何。”这些同志要市场不发生一点变化，自己却不去分析市场产销情况，对主要商品也不进行深入调查研究和分析的工作，这就不能不使自己的工作落在实际需要的后边。有些商品（如上海电线铁管，苏联新规格电线）在别的地方能销，为什么在东北某些地区就不能销呢？这并不是什么“销售构成有变化”，而是商业部门有些人缺乏为生产事业服务的主动精神。他们没有同厂矿和技术设计部门加强联系，深入学习商品性能，打通营业员思想，扭转用货单位思想。各地事实证明，只要切实地作了以上的工作，就一定会打开销路。那种单纯埋怨“商品销售构成发生变化”的思想是片面的。他们没有看到另外一面，这就是随着国家生产的发展、基本建设的扩大、交通电工器材商品流通额也随之增加。据沈阳市交电公司统计，一九五四年上半年交电商品市场销售额比一九五三年同期增加百分之七点四一。由此可见，某一种商品（如轮带）销售量可能减少，但只要我们扩大经营品种，就一定会争取提高总的销售量。
    五金器材等公司也有类似现象。例如沈阳机工商店的硬质合金刀，工厂十分需要，门市部买不到，可是仓库里却有积压。能够把这些责任推给“购买力或销售额的变化”吗？显然这是不应该的。商业部门应当检查为生产、为人民消费服务等方面存在的问题，发挥潜在力量。这样，就会发动职工的积极性，克服前进道路上的一切障碍。总之，目前应当研究的是如何抓紧时机去完成销售任务，而不要空谈“购买力的变化”，我们完成的任务越好，我们就越有可能给购买力的变化作出正确的结论。
    有人认为：“国家对某些物资内部调拨的计划性加强，因而使我们完不成计划”。不错，内部调拨物资扩大了，在一定程度上是会影响到五金、交电两公司的经营计划的。但应当认识到：国家内部调拨计划性的加强，这是好的而且是必然的现象，表明我们国家生活日益走向计划的领导；国家实行内部调拨，可以更灵活紧密地保证生产建设的需要，而不至于像一九五一年那样把大批生产资料变成商品积压在商店里，以致影响了建设的需要。今年东北地区商业计划中已把国家调拨扩大的因素做了估计。但，有些商业部门同志却把国家内部调拨同主观应作的努力对立起来。他们没有很好地适应国家加强计划性的特点来进行工作，有人甚至认为：我们只是“补不足”，“没事可干”。其实，应该干的事情太多，只是还没有干或是干得不好而已。因为国家调拨只占一小部分，国家调拨的大部分物资都是商店库存所没有的。它并没有妨碍商店的正常供应。譬如不在计划调拨内的室内电料在一九五三年的纯销比重只占全年的百分之三点七，而今年一至八月比重已升至百分之九点零一，这是由于基本建设竣工后安装工程、城市房屋的修建和整理的需要而引起的变化，它在交电系统的计划品种中已提到除汽车外的第一位，这不是说明可干的事情是很多吗？国家内部调拨的计划性加强，商业部门就应当更加加强主动性。那种“有货就卖，没货就算”“反正是这些规格，爱要不要”的思想作风是完成任务最大的障碍。很多地区商店同工矿企业之间的联系不好，不能及时地充分地供应生产的需要。沈阳五金公司同矿山机器厂订了购置滚珠的合同，到期不能全部供应；有些地方进货时不顾规格、质量，购进大量次品以致被迫退货、返工，使购买的生产单位受到影响。今年沈阳五金公司供应的平白铁和瓦垅铁曾经脱销，后来查明这些物资在长春、吉林、哈尔滨等地兄弟公司都有积压，业务部门却没有同这些单位联系。如果拿这些工作上的缺点所造成的损失同因国家调拨物资而减少的商业收入来作一比较，我们可以看到，影响完成计划的主要原因是前者，后者只占很小的比重。这就说明从主观上努力打开出路的实际意义。
    有人认为：“国家计划大了”，因而对完成计划抱有消极情绪。应当承认，今年若干地区和部门制订计划时对实际情况估计不足，可能会有偏大之处，这应当通过商业战线全体职工主观努力，从实践中找出编制计划的科学根据，以便明年搞好计划工作。现在的问题是：应当用什么态度来对待国家计划。是用尽最大努力坚决完成计划的积极态度呢？还是用消极的态度呢？今年东北区的商业计划到底大了多少呢？据了解，今年的计划基本上是由各地提出而经上级批准的。从历史情况看，过去计划一般是偏低，如沈阳市一九五三年商业计划经过上级提高，最后还是超额完成任务。这是一般的情况。今年上级没有增加计划任务。东北区现在执行的计划较全年规定的计划已减少了百分之六点五，第四季度计划没有包括前三季度拉下的任务数字，还较第四季度应当完成的数字减少了一些。东北各省市有着完成计划的充分可能性，而且应当完成较高的计划任务，因为东北区销售额中零售比重大于全国各地，交通畅达，运输便利，运费较低，今年农产品年成不低于去年。可是，叫喊“计划大”的人却没有考虑到这些实际条件，争取积极完成和超额完成计划，以支援全国受灾地区；有些领导干部看到下边同志嚷“计划大”，也就盲目叫喊。前辽东省商业厅在第三季度留下八百九十三亿元的销售任务没有往下布置，其中是否全部不能实现，很可怀疑。黑龙江省双城县煤建公司经理到省公司开会，他对出售的某种商品计划完成得最少，会上还受到省公司经理的表扬。这种对国家计划不严肃的态度，助长了下级完成计划的自由主义情绪。很多公司和商店不了解上级机关批准的商品流转计划是集中地表现了国营商业对整个市场的领导作用，它具有国家法律性质，必须坚决执行，而不是一遇到困难就要求上级修改。有人片面强调只有不断修改才能使计划趋于实际，可是，他们却不懂得什么叫做“实际”。计划应该符合实际，这是不错的，但这种实际不是自流得来的，更不是不费力气就可以取得的保守落后的东西，我们指的实际应当是平均先进的，这样才能指导群众，改变现状，并动员群众作更大的努力。
    有人认为：商业系统中心工作过多，是完不成计划的主要原因。应当承认，今年商业部门担负的工作是繁重的，一年来国营商业担负了计划收购、计划供应，私营商业的社会主义改造，调整国营商业同合作社的分工范围等任务。这些任务不能看作是负担，而应该看作是在党的正确政策领导下，加强了国营商业在市场上的领导作用。国营商业应该担负起计划和安排国内市场的责任，成为全国商业活动领导与指导的力量。是否因为我们的责任加重了就可以放松国营商业的购销工作呢？这是不应该的，国营商业扩大推销同扩大整个社会商品流转是一致的。据各地反映，今年一、二、三季度东北一些省商业工作中在不同程度上忽视了推销工作。旅大市是国营商业完成计划较好的一个地方，据该市商业局负责同志讲，他们在这时期也曾或多或少地忽视了推销工作，有些同志不了解：只有加强国营商业对市场的领导，大力支持工农业生产并满足消费者的需要，保证完成购销计划和财务计划，才能壮大和巩固领导的力量，顺利地安排和领导整个商业活动。国营商业要发挥领导的作用，同时也要努力完成全年的购销计划和财务计划，一切工作都应围绕这个经常性的中心任务来进行。目前的问题并不是所谓的中心工作同日常工作有什么矛盾，因为离开了日常工作就谈不到什么中心工作。今天比较严重的是在不少地方对于动员和组织一切力量保证完成商业全年购销计划还缺乏积极的行动措施和认真深入的工作。各省市县商业部门的领导同志在四季度第一个月份（十月）中基本上是在一连串大会小会中渡过的。许多的会议实际上只是要价还价，对实际完成计划较少裨益。现在时间紧迫，时不我待，应当减少会议，要把力量投到实际工作中去，具体帮助基层工作，加强思想工作，及时克服错误思想，并从多方面加强检查督促工作。
    什么东西阻碍商业计划的完成？应当肯定的回答，主观上的消极思想和各种与社会主义商业经营思想不相容的错误看法，是影响完成全年计划的主要原因。那种把责任推给客观原因的说法只能表明是向客观困难低头。东北各地商业部门已经开始注意扭转一些错误思想，希望在完成全年计划的紧张工作中，认真加强政治思想工作，坚决同一切消极的被动的思想情绪进行斗争。政治工作应当引导人们向先进看齐，要引导人们不但看到困难，还要认清完成计划的有利条件。第四季度是旺季，今年国家在农村集中收购，商品数量和品种都比去年多，农村生产合作社和冬季副业生产都将有更大的发展，一九五五年基本建设部门订货又已开始，这些有利条件给完成全年计划带来了极大的可能性。因此，我们要从政治上动员和组织全体职工满怀信心地来最后完成国家计划，大力开展增产节约运动，并在运动中鼓励和支持一切先进经验。我们只要发扬主观能动性，动员一切潜在力量为完成全年计划贡献出力量，它就必然会缩小以至于战胜客观的困难，从而保证全年计划的完成，并为一九五五年的工作打下良好的基础。
