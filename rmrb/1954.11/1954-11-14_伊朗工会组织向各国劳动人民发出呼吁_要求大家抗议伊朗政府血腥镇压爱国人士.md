Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, 13th. TASS Vienna, 12th. The Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions, at the request of the Iranian Central United Labor Council, has distributed the council's appeal to the working people, trade unions, and democratic newspapers of the world to national trade union organizations in various countries.

The appeal states: Frightened by the people's resolute struggle, the Iranian government, under the orders of its American and British masters, has unprecedentedly intensified suppression measures in the past two months. A large number of patriots have been arrested, subjected to torture, and then secretly tried by military tribunals and sentenced to death, for the sole reason that they fought for the survival and independence of their motherland.

In view of this situation, the Iranian Central United Labor Council appeals to you for solidarity. Please organize meetings and rallies to express your protest, please send delegations, write letters and send telegrams to your embassies in Iran or directly to the Iranian government and the United Nations to express your protest. Please also use all other methods to express your protest.

In this way, you will show the imperialists and their agents in Iran that the Iranian people are not isolated and helpless in their just struggle, and that they have the support of the working people of the world. Please firmly demand: 1. Release trade union fighters and all patriots from prisons and concentration camps, and cancel the verdicts, including death sentences; 2. Reinstate workers and staff who have been dismissed from all factories and institutions for trade union and political activities; 3. Stop anti-trade union and anti-democratic activities.

The international solidarity of the working class will be able to stop the anti-democratic suppression and massacres of the representatives of our nation, and the Iranian nation is fighting for its independence and survival.

Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, 13th. TASS Vienna, 12th. The Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions issued a statement saying: News from Iran proves that the rampant police terror within Iran has reached an unprecedented level in the history of this country.

A large number of Iranian democrats and patriots of various political factions, including many working people and leaders of the workers' movement, have been imprisoned and sent to concentration camps.

Government newspapers have also had to admit that prisons are overcrowded, but military and police authorities continue to make arrests every day.

Those arrested are subjected to severe torture.

According to reports in various newspapers, military tribunals have secretly sentenced dozens of people to death, and a group of patriots have recently been executed. All this proves that the Iranian authorities are trying to eliminate the last bit of democratic freedom in the country.

The intensification of suppression and the unfolding of bloody terror are happening at the same time as the authorities are transferring oil resources and the country's independence to the monopoly capital of the United States and Britain.

The World Federation of Trade Unions supports the outstanding and heroic struggle of the Iranian people and patriots, and exposes the inhuman police terror in front of international public opinion.

The World Federation of Trade Unions is convinced that all working people and all trade union organizations will support the calls of the Iranian working people and democrats around the world, and unanimously demand an end to the execution of Iranian patriots, the immediate release of the arrested fighters, and an end to the campaign of terror.

    伊朗工会组织向各国劳动人民发出呼吁
    要求大家抗议伊朗政府血腥镇压爱国人士
    【新华社十三日讯】塔斯社维也纳十二日讯：世界工会联合会书记处根据伊朗中央联合劳工理事会的请求，已把该理事会致全世界劳动人民、工会和民主报刊的呼吁书分发给各国的全国性工会组织。
    呼吁书说：由于人民的坚决斗争而惊慌起来的伊朗政府，在它的美英主子命令下，在过去两个月中空前地加紧了镇压措施。大批爱国者被逮捕，遭受酷刑，然后受军事法庭的秘密审讯并被判处死刑，唯一的理由就是因为他们为祖国的生存和独立而进行了斗争。
    鉴于这种情况，伊朗中央联合劳工理事会吁请你们声援。请你们组织会议和集会来表示抗议，请你们派遣代表团、写信和打电报给你们驻伊朗的大使馆或直接给伊朗政府和联合国表示抗议。也请你们使用其他一切方法来表示抗议。
    这样，你们将向帝国主义者和他们在伊朗的代理人表明，伊朗人民在他们进行正义的斗争中不是孤立无援的，他们得到全世界劳动人民的支持。请你们坚决要求：一、从监狱和集中营中释放工会战士和一切爱国者，并取消包括判处死刑的判决；二、恢复一切工厂和机关中因进行工会和政治活动而被解雇的工人和工作人员的工作；三、制止反对工会和反对民主的活动。
    工人阶级的国际声援将能制止对我们民族的代表的反民主的镇压和大规模屠杀，伊朗民族正在为它的独立和生存而斗争。
    【新华社十三日讯】塔斯社维也纳十二日讯：世界工会联合会书记处发表声明说：从伊朗来的消息证明，伊朗国内警察恐怖的猖狂，达到了这个国家历史上空前未有的程度。
    大批伊朗民主人士和各种政治派别的爱国者，其中包括许多劳动人民和工人运动的领导人，被监禁起来和送进集中营。
    政府报纸也不得不承认，监狱已挤得过满，然而军警当局仍然每天继续进行逮捕。
    被逮捕的人遭到严刑拷问。
    据各国报纸报道，军事法庭秘密地判决了几十个人的死刑，一批爱国人士最近被处决。这一切情况证明，伊朗当局正力图消灭国内的最后一点民主自由。
    镇压的加强和血腥恐怖的展开，是和当局把石油富源和国家的独立转送给美国和英国的垄断资本同时发生的。
    世界工会联合会支持伊朗人民和爱国人士卓越的、英勇的斗争，并在国际舆论面前揭穿不人道的警察恐怖行动。
    世界工会联合会确信，所有劳动人民、所有工会组织一定会支持伊朗劳动人民和全世界民主人士的呼声，一致要求停止对伊朗爱国人士的处决，立即释放被捕的战士，并停止恐怖行动。
