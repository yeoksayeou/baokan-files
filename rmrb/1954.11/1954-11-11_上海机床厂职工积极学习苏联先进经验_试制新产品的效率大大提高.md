    Shanghai Machine Tool Plant Workers Actively Study Advanced Soviet Experience
    Efficiency in Trial Manufacturing of New Products Greatly Increased
    Workers at the state-owned Shanghai Machine Tool Plant are actively studying advanced Soviet experience in trial manufacturing new products, greatly increasing work efficiency. Since April of last year, the plant has been trial-manufacturing various Soviet-style precision grinders, and trial manufacturing efficiency has significantly improved. Only one type was successfully trial-manufactured in nine months last year, while four types were successfully trial-manufactured from January to September this year. One of them is a special crankshaft grinder used for manufacturing automobiles, tractors, airplanes, and so on.
    During the trial manufacturing process, workers actively studied advanced Soviet experience in metal cutting, quenching, casting, and so on, greatly increasing work efficiency. For example, after lathe workers learned high-speed cutting and the Kolesov tool method, cutting efficiency generally increased by two to three times. Sheng Li, a lathe operator who won the title of Shanghai Model Worker, learned the Kolesov tool method, increasing work efficiency by three to five times. He has now completed one year and six months of production tasks. Some workers, after learning the whirling thread cutting method, increased work efficiency by more than ten times. The casting workshop learned the "three-row sealing" method, increasing the melting rate by 20 percent, reducing scrap steel by 25 to 50 percent, and saving more than 150 tons of coke. Since the beginning of this year, more than 200 workers at the plant have been named advanced workers and outstanding workers due to their active study of advanced Soviet experience.
    The release of the Sino-Soviet Communiqué gave the workers even greater encouragement. After completing one month and twenty-one days of production tasks in October, model worker Sheng Li set a plan to complete forty-one days of tasks in November. He is now studying the advanced Soviet experience of using magnetic knives instead of diamond knives.

    上海机床厂职工积极学习苏联先进经验
    试制新产品的效率大大提高
    国营上海机床厂职工在试制新产品中积极学习苏联先进经验，工作效率大大提高。该厂自去年四月份开始试制各种苏联式精密磨床，试制效率已有显著提高。去年九个月只试制成功一种，今年一至九月已试制成功四种。其中有一种是专为制造汽车、拖拉机、飞机等使用的特种曲轴磨床。
    在试制过程中，工人们积极学习了苏联的金属切削、淬火、铸造等的先进经验，工作效率大大提高。如车床工人学习了高速切削和科列索夫车刀法以后，切削效率普遍提高二至三倍。荣获上海市劳动模范称号的车工盛利学习了科列索夫车刀法，工作效率提高了三倍至五倍，现在他已完成了一年又六个月的生产任务。有的工人学习旋风切丝法以后，工作效率提高十倍以上。铸工车间学习了“三排封口”法，增加熔化率百分之二十，减少废钢百分之二十五到五十，节省焦炭一百五十多吨。今年以来该厂有二百多名工人，由于积极学习苏联先进经验被评为先进工作者和优秀工作者。
    中苏会谈公报的发布，给了工人们以更大的鼓舞，劳动模范盛利在十月份完成了一个月零二十一天的生产任务后，又订出在十一月份内完成四十一天任务的计划，现在他正在研究以磁刀代替金钢刀的苏联先进经验。
