Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The World Peace Council meeting continued its discussion of the first agenda item on the morning of the 19th, presided over by Hugh Johnson (UK).

    Romanian representative Academician Mirku, Dean of the Bucharest Medical Institute, spoke first. Mirku pointed out that Romania has consistently pursued a policy of international understanding and cooperation, and therefore firmly supports the policy of collective security, the policy of disarmament and prohibition of weapons of mass destruction, and the policy of peacefully and democratically resolving the German question. Mirku called on the public of all countries to unite and take strong action to oppose the decisions made at the London and Paris conferences.

    Professor Kemnitz of the University of Berlin then spoke. He said: If the Paris Accords are ratified, then a military state will emerge that, once armed, will abandon all restrictions.

    Kemnitz said that the Paris Accords deepen the division of our motherland and intensify the opposition in Europe. We do not want to turn Germany into a military springboard. We do not want to be involved in any strategic plans. The recent Soviet proposals have been widely received in both West and East Germany. People everywhere see the conference proposed by the Soviet Union as a great opportunity to eliminate dangerous obstacles on the path of consultation. Germany is once again at a crossroads. As Germans, we have the primary responsibility to prevent the ratification of the London and Paris Accords and to reopen the path of mutual understanding in Europe.

    Chinese representative Cai Tingkai spoke (full text to be published separately).

    Icelandic representative Mrs. Thorvaldsson spoke. She talked about how her country became a military base for Western countries and how the Icelandic people fought against the American military occupation.

    Soviet representative Archbishop Nikolai spoke. He said that after the publication of the Soviet government's note on November 13, the profound significance of the issue of pan-European security is especially clear. Our country has pointed out to the people of European countries that it is possible to combine security interests with trust and cooperation, which is in the vital interests of European countries and is of decisive significance for consolidating universal peace. If all the Christian churches in the West and the Orthodox Church in the East work together, together with all peace-loving people in the world, to defend the peace on which the happiness of Europe and all mankind depends, then this is the fruit of Christian faith.

    Also speaking at the morning session on the 19th were Belgian public leader and former Member of Parliament, Mrs. I. Blum, British representative Maguire, Israeli Member of Parliament Janri, Professor Kokalis of the University of Athens, British representative and General Secretary of the Firefighters Union Burns, and Hungarian representative Dery.

    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The World Peace Council continued its meeting in the afternoon and evening of the 19th. At the afternoon meeting, the discussion of the second agenda item began – "The situation created in various parts of Asia due to foreign interference, the establishment of military blocs and military alliances." Soviet representative Fadeev served as chairman.

    Indian representative Romesh Chandra gave a report on this issue.

    Chandra first emphasized that relations between countries should be based on the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. He pointed out that the relations between India and China are based on the above five principles. Many other countries in Asia have also accepted these five principles, defined in the joint statement by Zhou Enlai and Nehru, as the basis for relations between countries. People all over the world regard these five principles as the path to victory for peace in the world.

    Chandra continued, saying that the proposition of Asia as a peace zone has become a powerful force. To make Asia a "continent of peace" – this is the goal of our efforts. At the same time, the people of Asia will not forget that those who are hostile to our freedom and peaceful labor are frantically trying to hinder the consolidation of Asian people's unity and trying to divide them. These people are stepping up suppression in an attempt to rule the people of Asia.

    Chandra emphatically pointed out the sinister purposes of the Southeast Asia military bloc and condemned the aggressive groups of some countries for attempting to prevent the resolution of the Korean issue and the Indochina issue. He also pointed out that in Indonesia, some people are attempting to overthrow the current government. This attempt is obviously instigated by the United States. In the Middle East, intervention takes the form of large-scale suppression. Chandra said that if the people of Asian countries become complacent and let the cause of consolidating peace drift, then all these sinister attempts cannot be broken.

    Chandra then explained the goals of the movement to strive for Asian unity. He said: First, we want to build a peaceful continent, a strong peace zone, where countries sign a series of bilateral and multilateral treaties based on the historic Five Principles. The mutual relations between these countries, as well as their relations with other countries in the world, should be based on these five principles. Second, we demand an end to all military conventions that attempt to divide us and rule us. Third, our goal is: to eliminate colonialism, to end foreign interference in our affairs, to oppose foreign bases, and to oppose foreign occupation of our territory. Fourth, the movement to strive for unity in Asia demands that the People's Republic of China immediately obtain its seat in the United Nations. Fifth, the movement to strive for unity in Asia should do everything possible to establish a free and peaceful Japan, without foreign bases on its territory, making it a country that maintains friendly relations with all countries. Finally, the movement to strive for unity in Asia should promote the consolidation of peace after the armistice in Indochina and Korea, in order to guarantee the freedom and unity of the people of Korea, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.

    Chandra pointed out that the American aggressive bloc is attempting to use the Chiang Kai-shek group to launch a war against the People's Republic of China. The people of Asia are closely watching this plan of the United States.

    Chandra said that the people of Asia firmly believe that this session of the World Peace Council will push forward the struggle for Asian unity and to turn Asia into a continent of peace.

    On the evening of the 19th, the meeting first began to discuss Chandra's report.

    Korean representative Han Xueye spoke. He pointed out that after the Korean Armistice Agreement was reached, the American ruling group has been trying in every possible way to prevent a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. He said that the Korean people insist that a conference with the broad participation of all relevant countries should be held in the near future to discuss this issue. He said that the Korean people want peace and the reunification of the motherland on the basis of peace. We believe that the first practical step is that representatives from North and South Korea must meet to discuss the issue of national reunification.

    Iranian representative B. Alavi spoke, pointing out that imperialists and their mercenaries are trying to drag Iran into an aggressive military bloc.

    Indian pastor Williams spoke. He said that world opinion must be drawn to the increasing pressure suffered by the people of colonial countries. He also said: The Southeast Asia aggressive bloc is a threat to the people of Asian countries because its purpose is to gather imperialist forces and suppress the national liberation movements of Asian countries.

    East Pakistani representative Maulana Abdul Hamid Bhashani spoke. He pointed out that the military blocs established by aggressive countries are not only to oppose the Soviet Union, New China, and Eastern European countries, but also to oppose the forces that are striving for national independence. Bhashani talked about the great role played by New China in the cause of defending peace. He said that Asian countries should demand the restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations. Bhashani said that the rulers of Pakistan have dragged the country into a military bloc against the will of the Pakistani people.

    After Bhashani's speech, a delegation of participants in the "Peace Voyage" entered the meeting hall. Dr. Rénouf, on behalf of the delegation, read out a congratulatory message to the meeting and the resolution passed by the participants of the "Peace Voyage" after the voyage ended. The representatives attending the meeting warmly welcomed them.

    Then, Vietnamese representative Lê Đình Thám spoke. He emphatically pointed out that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is implementing all the provisions of the ceasefire agreement and is doing its best to quickly carry out the restoration work in the liberated areas. However, French troops and Bảo Đại elements, under the direction of American imperialism, are constantly violating the ceasefire agreement. Lê Đình Thám pointed out that the purpose of the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc is primarily to undermine the implementation of the Geneva Accords. After the formation of this aggressive bloc, the American government gave the French government 350 million US dollars in financial assistance to maintain the French expeditionary force in Indochina and restore the army of Bảo Đại.

    Next, Chinese representative Liu Ningyi spoke (full text to be published separately).

    The meeting recessed after Liu Ningyi's speech. After the recess, the meeting turned to continue the discussion of the first agenda item. Canadian representative Wén Yòuzhāng served as chairman.

    Dutch physicist Mrs. Minnat-Kolin talked about the unease caused by the London Accords and Paris Accords in the Netherlands. She said that in Amsterdam, in a short period of time, more than 10,000 people signed a petition protesting the ratification of these two accords.

    General Secretary of the French General Confederation of Labor, Léripe, emphasized in his speech the dangers of the London Accords and Paris Accords for France. He said that according to the terms of these accords, German troops can be stationed on the territory of France or Belgium and other countries, which is equivalent to a new occupation. The leaders of the Western European Union can also intervene in member states of the Western European Union on the pretext that popular movements threaten order. That is to say, foreign troops can enter any member state to suppress demonstrations and strikes. After pointing out the difficulties caused to the French people's struggle by the French government's hasty actions to ratify the London and Paris Accords, Léripe said: The French people will definitely be able to fulfill their responsibilities. United, we will surely win again.

    The next speaker was Austrian representative Professor Brandweiner. He said: The pan-European collective security treaty proposed by the Soviet Union meets all the requirements regarding regional agreements stipulated in the United Nations Charter. The pan-European treaty will not only not divide the European continent, but will unite it. At the same time, the pan-European treaty can create conditions to promote the early restoration of German unity on a peaceful and democratic basis and to resolve the Austrian issue, because the pan-European treaty will completely eliminate the danger of German militarism.

    Also speaking at the meeting were: Diallo, Chairman of the Dakar Peace Defense Committee of French West Africa, Norwegian representative Pastor R. Foberg, and J. Michels, Secretary of the Luxembourg National Peace Committee.

    世界和平理事会会议开始讨论第二项议程
    据新华社讯：世界和平理事会十九日上午会议在休·约翰逊（英国）主持下继续讨论第一项议程。
    罗马尼亚代表、布加勒斯特医学院院长米尔库院士首先发言。米尔库指出，罗马尼亚一贯实行国际间相互谅解和合作的政策，因而坚决拥护集体安全的政策，拥护裁军和禁止大规模毁灭性武器的政策，拥护以和平民主方式解决德国问题的政策。米尔库号召各国的公众团结起来，迅速采取有力的行动，反对伦敦和巴黎会议上所作出的决定。
    柏林大学教授坎姆尼茨接着发言。他说：如果巴黎协定被批准，那末就会出现这样一个军事国家，它一旦武装起来，就会抛弃一切限制。
    坎姆尼茨说，巴黎协定使我们祖国的分裂加深，使欧洲的对立加剧。我们不愿意把德国变成军事跳板。我们不愿意卷入任何战略计划。苏联最近提出的建议在西德和东德都得到广泛的反应。各地人们都把苏联建议召开的会议看作是消除协商道路上的危险障碍的大好机会。德国又一次站在十字路口上。在阻止批准伦敦和巴黎协定和使欧洲互相谅解的道路重新畅通方面，作为德国人，我们负有主要责任。
    中国代表蔡廷锴发言（全文另发）。
    冰岛代表索尔瓦尔德逊夫人发言。她谈到她的国家如何变成西方国家的军事基地，以及冰岛人民如何对美国的军事占领进行斗争。
    苏联代表尼古拉大主教发言。他说，苏联政府十一月十三日的照会发表之后，全欧安全问题的深刻意义是尤其明显了。我们国家向欧洲各国人民指出，有可能把安全的利益同信任及合作结合起来，这是符合欧洲各国的切身利益的，对于巩固普遍和平具有决定性的意义。如果西方的全体基督教会和东方的正教协同一致，和世界一切爱好和平的人一道保卫欧洲和全人类的幸福所赖以存在的和平，那这就是信仰基督教的成果。
    在十九日上午会议上发言的还有比利时公众领袖、前议会议员伊·布伦姆夫人、英国代表马奎尔、以色列议会议员扬里、雅典大学教授科卡利斯、英国代表、救火员工会总书记伯恩斯和匈牙利代表德里。
      据新华社讯：世界和平理事会十九日下午和晚间继续举行会议。在下午的会议上，开始讨论第二项议程——“由于外国干涉、由于建立军事集团和军事同盟而在亚洲各地造成的局势。”由苏联代表法捷耶夫担任主席。
      印度代表罗米希·钱德拉就这个问题作了报告。
    钱德拉首先着重说，各国之间的关系应当以互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利和和平共处的原则为基础。他指出，印度和中国之间的关系是以上述五项原则为基础的。亚洲其他好些国家也接受了周恩来和尼赫鲁联合声明中确定的这五项原则作为各国之间关系的基础。全世界人民把这五项原则看作和平在全世界取得胜利的道路。
    钱德拉接着说，关于亚洲和平地区的主张已成为一股强大的力量。使亚洲成为“和平大陆”——这就是我们努力的目标。亚洲人民同时不会忘掉：敌视我们的自由和和平劳动的人正在疯狂地力图阻碍亚洲人民团结的巩固，并力图分裂他们。这些人正加紧镇压，企图统治亚洲人民。
    钱德拉着重地指出了东南亚军事集团的罪恶目的，并谴责一些国家的侵略集团企图阻止朝鲜问题和印度支那问题的解决。他又指出，在印度尼西亚，有人企图推翻现政府。这种企图显然是美国指使的。在中东，干涉采取大规模镇压的形式。钱德拉说，如果亚洲各国人民陷于自满，而一任巩固和平的事业自流，那么就不能击破所有这些凶恶的企图。
    钱德拉接着说明了争取亚洲团结的运动的目标。他说：第一，我们要建立一个和平的大陆，一个强固的和平地区，这个地区的各国签订一系列以历史性的五项原则为基础的双边的和多边的条约。这些国家之间的相互关系以及同全世界其他国家的关系，都应当以这五项原则为基础。第二，我们要求终结一切企图分裂我们和统治我们的军事公约。第三，我们奋斗的目标是：消灭殖民主义，终止外国对我们事务的干涉，反对外国基地，反对外国占领我们的领土。第四，我们争取团结的运动要求立刻让中华人民共和国得到它在联合国中的席位。第五，争取亚洲团结的运动应该尽一切力量建立自由、和平的日本，在它的领土上要没有外国基地，使它成为一个和一切国家保持友好关系的国家。最后，争取亚洲团结的运动应当在印度支那和朝鲜停战之后促成和平的巩固，以保障朝鲜、越南、老挝和柬埔寨人民的自由和统一。
    钱德拉指出，美国侵略集团企图利用蒋介石集团对中华人民共和国发动战争。亚洲人民正在密切地注意着美国这个计划。
    钱德拉说，亚洲人民深信，世界和平理事会本届会议将使争取亚洲团结、把亚洲变成和平大陆的斗争向前推进一步。
    十九日晚，会议首先开始讨论钱德拉的报告。
    朝鲜代表韩雪野发言。他指出，在朝鲜停战协定达成以后，美国统治集团一直千方百计地企图阻止朝鲜问题的和平解决。他说，朝鲜人民坚持主张：应当在最近期间召开有各有关国家广泛参加的会议来讨论这个问题。他说，朝鲜人民希望和平以及在和平的基础上统一祖国。我们认为，第一个实际步骤是：南北朝鲜的代表必须进行会晤，以讨论统一国家的问题。
    伊朗代表博·阿拉维发言指出，帝国主义者和他们的雇佣分子力图把伊朗拉入侵略性的军事集团。
    印度牧师威廉斯发言。他说，必须引起世界舆论对殖民地各国人民所遭到的日益强烈的压力加以注意。他又说：东南亚侵略集团是对亚洲各国人民的威胁，因为它的目的是纠集帝国主义的力量，镇压亚洲各国人民的民族解放运动。
    东巴基斯坦代表毛拉纳·阿卜杜勒·哈密德·巴沙尼发言。他指出，侵略国家所建立的军事集团，不仅是要反对苏联、新中国和东欧各国，而且也要反对那种正在争取民族独立的力量。巴沙尼谈到新中国在保卫和平事业中所起的巨大作用。他说，亚洲各国应当要求恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法权利。巴沙尼说，巴基斯坦的执政者违反巴基斯坦人民的意志而把国家拖入了军事集团。
    巴沙尼发言后，“和平航行”参加者的代表团进入了会议大厅。雷诺夫博士代表代表团宣读了给会议的贺词和“和平航行”的参加者在航行结束后通过的决议。出席会议的代表对他们表示热烈欢迎。
    接着越南代表黎廷探发言。他着重指出，越南民主共和国政府执行着停战协定的全部条款，并在尽全力迅速进行解放区的恢复工作。但是法国军队和保大分子却在美国帝国主义的指使下不断违反停战协定。黎廷探指出，东南亚侵略集团的目的首先是破坏日内瓦协定的实行，在这个侵略集团成立以后，美国政府就给予法国政府三亿五千万美元财政援助，以保持在印度支那的法国远征军和恢复保大的军队。
    接着，中国代表刘宁一发言（全文另发）。
    会议在刘宁一发言后休息。休息后，会议转而继续讨论第一项议程。由加拿大代表文幼章任主席。
    荷兰物理学家明纳特—柯林夫人谈到了伦敦协定和巴黎协定在荷兰所引起的不安。她说，在阿姆斯特丹，在短短的时期内就有一万多人在抗议批准这两个协定的呼吁书上签了名。
    法国总工会总书记勒里普在发言中着重指出了伦敦协定和巴黎协定对法国的危险性。他说，根据这些协定的条款，德国军队可以驻扎在法国或比利时等国的领土上，这就等于新的占领。西欧联盟的领导人还可以借口人民运动威胁秩序而对西欧联盟成员国进行干涉。这就是说，外国军队可以开入任何成员国去镇压示威游行和罢工。勒里普在指出了法国政府力图批准伦敦和巴黎协定的匆忙行动给法国人民斗争所造成的困难之后说：法国人民一定能履行自己的责任。团结起来，我们就一定能再次获得胜利。
    接着发言的是奥地利代表布兰德魏纳教授。他说：苏联所建议的全欧集体安全条约是符合联合国宪章中所规定关于区域性协定的全部要求的。全欧条约不仅不会分裂欧洲大陆，而且会使它团结起来。同时，全欧条约能够创造条件，促使德国早日在和平和民主的基础上恢复统一，使奥地利问题得到解决，因为全欧条约会彻底地消除德国军国主义的危险。
    在会上发言的还有：法属西非达喀尔保卫和平委员会主席迪亚洛、挪威代表拉·福贝克牧师、卢森堡全国和平委员会书记杰·密歇尔斯。
