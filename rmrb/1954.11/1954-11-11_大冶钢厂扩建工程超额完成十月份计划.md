    Daye Steel Plant Expansion Project Exceeds October Plan

    The various construction sites of the Daye Steel Plant expansion project exceeded their October plans. Among them, the open-hearth furnace construction site exceeded the plan by 26.7%; the workers' village construction site exceeded the plan by 16%; and the comprehensive repair workshop and garage construction site exceeded the plan by 50%. The quality of the projects generally met the standards.

    In October, leading cadres at various construction sites went deep into the field to solve key problems, accelerating the progress of the project. For example, the leaders of the open-hearth furnace construction site discovered that the piling work was the key at the time. If progress was slow, it would directly affect the pouring of concrete, causing a large number of workers to stand idle. In response to this situation, the Party branch quickly made a resolution to "accelerate the piling project on the basis of ensuring quality." The construction site director personally guided the work, coupled with the efforts of the piling workers and crane workers, so that the annual piling task was completed ahead of schedule on October 25. As a result, many concrete pouring projects were also started and completed ahead of schedule, increasing production and saving the country more than 300 million yuan.

    In October, employees at various construction sites launched labor competitions, and new records continued to emerge. For example, bricklayers at the workers' village construction site generally exceeded their quotas by 50% to 200%; when the Zhao Asi group was building clear water walls, the quota was 1,500 bricks, but they averaged more than 4,000 bricks per person, with the highest reaching 5,100 bricks. The Du Yongping work section at the Diaobao Mountain construction site improved the labor force allocation for digging, loading, and pushing carts, and completed the entire month's task on October 18; each person exceeded the quota by an average of 0.61 cubic meters per day.

    The dredging and blowing vessels from Shanghai, participating in the pond-filling project, completed more than 147,600 cubic meters from October 16 to the end of the month, which is equivalent to 100,000 workers working for a day, while the cost is much lower than manual pond-filling. They guarantee to complete all the pond-filling tasks before the 18th of this month.

    Currently, the movement to increase production and practice economy is unfolding in depth at various construction sites, and all employees are full of confidence in striving to complete and overfulfill the November plan.　　　　　(Zhou Ti)

    大冶钢厂扩建工程超额完成十月份计划
    大冶钢厂扩建工程各工地，超额完成了十月份计划。其中平炉工地超额百分之二十六点七；工人村工地超额百分之十六；综合修理车间和汽车库工地超额百分之五十。工程质量一般都合乎标准。
    十月份，各工地领导干部深入现场，解决关键问题，加速了工程进度。如平炉工地领导上发现打桩工作是当时的关键，如果进展缓慢，将直接影响混凝土的浇灌，造成大批工人窝工。党支部针对这种情况迅速作出了在“保证质量的基础上加速打桩工程”的决议，工地主任亲自指导，加上打桩工人和起高工人的努力，使全年的打桩任务提前在十月二十五日完成。因此许多混凝土浇灌工程也提前开始和提前完成，给国家增产节约了三亿多元。
    在十月份，各工地职工开展了劳动竞赛，新纪录不断出现。如工人村工地砌墙工人一般都超过定额百分之五十到二百；赵阿四小组在砌清水墙时，定额是一千五百块，而他们平均每人砌到四千多块，最高到五千一百块。碉堡山工地杜永平工段改进了挖土、装车、推车的劳动力配备，在十月十八日就完成了全月的任务；每人每日平均超过定额零点六一方。
    参加填塘工程、来自上海的挖泥船和吹泥船，从十月十六日到月底完成了十四万七千六百多方，等于十万工人工作一天，同时成本比人工填塘要低很多。他们保证要在本月十八日以前，全部完成填塘任务。
    现在各工地的增产节约运动正深入展开，全体职工满怀信心地争取完成和超额完成十一月份的计划。　　　　　（周惕）
