    New High-Voltage Power Line Between Beijing and Tianjin Begins Transmitting Power

    The newly built 110,000-volt high-voltage power line between Beijing and Tianjin began transmitting power at 12:00 on the 12th. From now on, the electricity supplied from Tianjin to the capital will double.

    This high-voltage power line was designed according to Soviet technical standards, and is 108 kilometers long, entirely constructed with iron towers and concrete poles. It changes the situation where the old line's power transmission capacity could not keep up with the increasing electricity consumption of the capital, ensuring the power supply for the capital's peak winter load.

    The line project started fully on July 4th this year and was completed on October 31st. In early November, the staff conducted a comprehensive inspection of the quality of the entire line project. From November 8th to 11th, the Central Testing Institute of the General Administration of Electric Power Management of the Ministry of Fuel Industry conducted various electrical performance tests, and the test results were good.

    北京、天津间新建高压送电线路开始送电
    北京、天津间新建的十一万伏特高压送电线路十二日十二时开始送电。从此，自天津送到首都来的电力增加一倍。
    这条高压送电线路是依照苏联技术标准设计的，全长一百零八公里，全部用铁塔和水泥杆子架设。它改变了旧线路送电能力和首都用电量增长不适应的情况，保证首都冬季高峰负荷的电源供应。
    线路工程在今年七月四日全面动工，十月三十一日完工。十一月初，职工们作了一次全线工程质量的综合大检查。十一月八日到十一日上午，燃料工业部电业管理总局中心试验所进行了各种电气性能的试验，试验结果良好。　（新华社）
