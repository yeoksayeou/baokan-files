Xinhua News Agency, New York, 17th - The Special Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly concluded its discussion on the question of admitting new member states on the 15th. An attempt by some Western countries, led by the United States, to force the committee to pass a proposal unilaterally supporting the admission of countries favored by them into the United Nations was unsuccessful. The committee unanimously adopted the joint proposal of Argentina, India, Cuba, and El Salvador, recommending that all applications for membership be referred back to the Security Council for further consideration and positive recommendations. The proposal also stipulates that the "Good Offices" Committee should continue its work, working with the Security Council to make the utmost effort to resolve this issue, and report its work results to the General Assembly, if possible, during the current session or at the latest during the tenth session.

During the committee's general debate, a total of three proposals and one amendment were put forward.

Based on the spirit that the United Nations should open its doors to all countries that meet the requirements of the Charter, regardless of their social and political systems, the Soviet delegation submitted a proposal suggesting that the General Assembly request the Security Council to reconsider the applications of Albania, the Mongolian People's Republic, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Finland, Italy, Portugal, Jordan, Ireland, Austria, Ceylon, Nepal, and Libya, in order to make recommendations for the simultaneous admission of these fourteen countries into the United Nations.

The delegations of Argentina, Cuba, and El Salvador put forward another proposal suggesting that the Security Council should allow Austria, Ireland, Italy, Libya, Nepal, Portugal, Finland, Jordan, Ceylon, and Japan to join the United Nations. The United States delegation's amendment to this proposal even demanded that South Korea and Bao Daï's Vietnam also be included. This proposal, as well as the US amendment, reflected the one-sided attitude that Western countries have long adhered to on the issue of admitting new member states, which is to exclude democratic countries such as Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, the Mongolian People's Republic, and Romania. This attitude of Western countries was justly criticized by the delegations of India, Indonesia, Syria, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and the Soviet Union during the committee's discussions.

The delegations of Australia, Pakistan, and Thailand put forward a proposal requesting the admission of Laos and Cambodia into the United Nations. The Soviet Union and the delegations of other countries pointed out in the discussion that it would be appropriate to postpone consideration of these applications until after the final settlement of the entire Indochina issue in accordance with the Geneva Accords.

After the committee concluded the general debate and began discussing the proposals, Argentina, India, Cuba, and El Salvador put forward their joint proposal. The Soviet delegation expressed its support for this proposal. Soviet representative Sobolev pointed out in his speech that the Soviet proposal to simultaneously admit fourteen countries into the United Nations was in line with the principle of the universality of the United Nations and the provisions of the United Nations Charter. If the Soviet proposal were adopted, the United Nations could overcome the abnormal state of affairs in the issue of admitting new member states. At the same time, Sobolev emphasized that the Soviet delegation was willing to do everything possible to continue to find ways to solve this important issue in a spirit of cooperation and understanding, and therefore, the Soviet delegation would vote in favor of this proposal.

Many delegations expressed the hope that the proposal of Argentina, India, Cuba, and El Salvador would be voted on first, because the purpose of this proposal was to promote the resolution of the issue under discussion in the spirit of the universality that the United Nations should have. The Indian representative moved to give priority to voting on this proposal. Despite the efforts of some delegations, including the United States, Australia, France, and the United Kingdom, to obstruct it, the Indian motion passed. The proposal of Argentina, India, Cuba, and El Salvador was then voted on first and was unanimously adopted. In this way, the majority of delegations indicated that they hoped that this would ease the situation in the issue of admitting new member states and help to achieve a constructive solution.

For the same purpose, the delegations of India and Indonesia jointly proposed that all other proposals and amendments be submitted to the Security Council. The representatives of the United States, Britain, France, and Australia opposed this proposal, once again attempting to force the committee to vote on proposals favoring countries they favored. However, the committee passed the joint proposal of India and Indonesia by twenty-five votes in favor, twenty-four votes against, and six abstentions.

    联大特别政委会结束关于接纳新会员国问题的讨论
    决议把各种提案送交安理会考虑处理
    【新华社十七日讯】纽约消息：联合国大会特别政治委员会在十五日结束了关于接纳新会员国问题的讨论。以美国为首的一些西方国家想强使委员会通过片面地支持他们所中意的国家参加联合国的提案，结果没有成功。委员会一致通过了阿根廷、印度、古巴和萨尔瓦多四国的联合提案，建议把所有要求加入联合国的申请，交回安全理事会作进一步考虑并作出积极的推荐。提案同时规定让“斡旋”委员会继续进行工作，会同安全理事会尽最大努力来解决这个问题，并且可能时在本届会议期间，或至迟在第十届会议期间，向大会报告它的工作结果。
    在委员会进行一般性辩论的过程中，一共提出了三个提案和一个修正案。
    苏联代表团根据联合国应当向所有符合于宪章要求的国家开门，而不问它们的社会和政治制度如何的精神，提出一项提案，建议大会要求安全理事会重新考虑阿尔巴尼亚、蒙古人民共和国、保加利亚、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、芬兰、意大利、葡萄牙、约旦、爱尔兰、奥地利、锡兰、尼泊尔和利比亚等十四国的申请，以便作出同时接纳这些国家参加联合国的推荐。
    阿根廷、古巴和萨尔瓦多三国代表团提出了另一个提案，建议安全理事会应该让奥地利、爱尔兰、意大利、利比亚、尼泊尔、葡萄牙、芬兰、约旦、锡兰和日本加入联合国。美国代表团对这个提案提出的修正案，甚至要求把南朝鲜和保大越南也列进去。这个提案以及美国的修正案，反映了西方国家长久以来在接纳新会员国问题上所坚持的片面态度，也就是要排斥像阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、匈牙利、蒙古人民共和国和罗马尼亚这样的民主国家。西方国家的这种态度，在委员会讨论过程中受到了印度、印度尼西亚、叙利亚、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克和苏联的代表团正当的批评。
    澳大利亚、巴基斯坦和泰国的代表团提出了一个要求接纳老挝和柬埔寨参加联合国的提案。苏联以及其他一些国家的代表团在讨论中曾指出，把这些申请推迟到根据日内瓦协定最后解决整个印度支那问题以后再加以考虑才是适宜的。
    在委员会结束了一般性辩论并开始讨论提案后，阿根廷、印度、古巴和萨尔瓦多四国提出了它们的联合提案。苏联代表团对这一提案表示支持。苏联代表索波列夫发言指出，苏联提案建议同时接纳十四个国家加入联合国，是符合联合国的普遍性的原则和联合国宪章的规定的。如果通过了苏联提案，联合国就可以克服在接纳新会员国问题上的不正常状态。同时，索波列夫又强调说，苏联代表团愿意尽一切力量继续寻找本着合作和谅解的精神解决这个重要问题的办法，因此，苏联代表团将投票赞成这个提案。
    许多代表团表示希望首先表决阿根廷、印度、古巴和萨尔瓦多的提案，因为这个提案的目的是要促使讨论中的问题本着联合国应当具有普遍性的精神来解决。印度代表动议优先表决这一提案。尽管包括美国、澳大利亚、法国和英国在内的一些代表团竭力阻挠，印度的动议还是通过了。阿根廷、印度、古巴和萨尔瓦多的提案于是首先进行表决，并得到一致通过。这样，大多数代表团就表明了，它们希望这将使在接纳新会员国问题上所产生的局势得到缓和，并有助于获得建设性的解决办法。
    为了同一目的，印度和印度尼西亚的代表团联合提出一项提案，建议把所有其他提案和修正案都送交安全理事会。美、英、法和澳大利亚的代表团反对这项提案，再一次企图强使委员会就偏袒他们所中意的国家的提案进行表决。但是委员会以二十五票赞成、二十四票反对、六票弃权，通过了印度和印度尼西亚的联合提案。
