    Partial Factories in Shenyang Establish "Women's Hygiene Rooms"
    Several dozen factories in Shenyang have learned from advanced Soviet experiences and established "Women's Hygiene Rooms," allowing female workers to handle menstruation in a hygienic manner. Some factories' "Women's Hygiene Rooms" already have good facilities. For example, the "Women's Hygiene Room" at the Shenyang Transformer Factory is equipped with hot water tanks, washing rooms, drying rooms, material boxes, hand-washing devices, and many books on women's hygiene knowledge. The room has full-time cadres who, in addition to being responsible for the daily work of the room, also use female workers' rest time to explain hygiene knowledge to them. Since the Shenyang Hemp Bag Factory established its "Women's Hygiene Room" in February 1953, most of the female workers have developed the habit of handling menstruation in a clean and hygienic way, reducing or preventing the occurrence of certain gynecological diseases. In the past, 78.9% of the female employees in the factory suffered from gynecological diseases. By the end of September this year, the number of those suffering from gynecological diseases had been reduced to 7.6%. A female worker in the Hemp Bag Factory's preparation workshop used to have to take two to three days of leave each month due to menstrual problems. Since the factory had the "Women's Hygiene Room," she has not missed a single day of work during menstruation, ensuring her attendance rate. (Xinhua News Agency)

    沈阳市部分工厂
    建立“妇女卫生室”
    沈阳市已有几十个工厂学习苏联先进经验，建立了“妇女卫生室”，让女工们在这里用合乎卫生的方法来处理月经。有些工厂的“妇女卫生室”已有良好的设备。如沈阳变压器厂的“妇女卫生室”内设有暖水箱、洗涤室、干燥室、材料箱、洗手器，并备有很多有关妇女卫生常识的图书，室内设有专职干部，除负责室内日常工作外，还利用女工休息时间给女工们讲解卫生常识。沈阳麻袋厂从一九五三年二月成立“妇女卫生室”以后，大部分女工都养成了用清洁卫生的方法处理月经的习惯，减少或预防了某些妇科病的发生。过去全厂患妇科病的占妇女职工中的百分之七十八点九，到今年九月底统计，患妇科病的已降低到百分之七点六。麻袋厂准备车间有个女工过去每月因月经病必需请假两天到三天，自从工厂里有了“妇女卫生室”后，月经期间一天也不误工，保证了出勤率。  （新华社）
