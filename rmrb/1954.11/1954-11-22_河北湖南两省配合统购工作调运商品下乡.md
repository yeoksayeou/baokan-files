Hebei and Hunan Provinces Cooperatively Transfer Commodities to Rural Areas to Support Unified Purchase Work

Hebei Province's state-owned commercial enterprises and cooperatives are transferring large quantities of goods to rural areas to support the state's unified purchase of grain, cotton, and oil crops. In the first ten days of November, state-owned companies supplied over 258,000 tons of coal, over 300,000 bolts of cotton cloth, and over 4 million jin of edible salt to rural areas. During these ten days, the state-owned commercial departments in Shijiazhuang transferred a total of over 190 billion yuan worth of general merchandise to lower levels. Since mid-October, seven state-owned department stores in Zhangjiakou, Shijiazhuang, and other places, under the leadership of the local People's Government Financial and Economic Committee, have successively held internal commodity exchange meetings for state-owned companies and cooperatives. When grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives purchased goods at the exchange meetings, they increased the variety of goods.

Since late October, various places in Hebei have widely held commodity exchange fairs, allowing commodities to meet with farmers. Small rural commodity exchange fairs, with grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives as units and market towns and temple fairs as sales focuses, have also been held successively in various places.

Currently, the situation of commodity backlog at the upper levels and commodity shortages at the lower levels has begun to change. According to the statistics of nine department store branches, the proportion of urban commodity inventory in the total urban and rural inventory has decreased from 54.84% to 49.62%. The inventory of 123 county stores increased by 21.6% in October compared to September. In many areas, due to the increase in goods in grassroots sales units, the sales volume of industrial products in rural areas has increased significantly. The sales volume of department stores in 25 counties in Shijiazhuang Prefecture in the last ten days of October increased by 74% compared to the first ten days of October. (Ji Xin)

Xinhua News Agency: According to incomplete statistics, from October 1st to November 10th, state-owned commercial departments in Hunan Province transferred more than 56,900 tons of various commodities, including cloth, general merchandise, edible salt, and medicines, to towns and rural areas.

In order to timely meet the needs of the broad masses of farmers for daily necessities after selling grain, oil crops, and other agricultural products, the Hunan Provincial People's Government Commercial Department specifically established a Material Transfer Office in late October, which formulated a commodity transfer plan based on local inventory conditions and the needs of the masses. Priority is given to transferring commodities that are currently most needed by farmers, such as cotton cloth, cotton, knitwear, cotton textiles, and edible salt. Among the commodities transferred to rural areas, there are as many as 300,000 dozen winter socks, more than 135,000 pounds of wool yarn, and more than 1,200 tons of sugar. The Provincial Commercial Department also transferred nearly 400 commercial workers to various places to assist in commodity sales. State-owned commercial departments in Hengyang Prefecture recently organized more than 400 peddlers to deliver goods to the countryside. (Xinhua News Agency)

    河北湖南两省配合统购工作调运商品下乡
    河北省各地国营商业和合作社调运大批物资下乡，配合国家统购粮食、棉花和油料。十一月上旬各国营公司供应农村的煤有二十五万八千多吨，各种棉布三十多万匹，食盐四百多万斤。这十天，石家庄的国营商业部门下调的百货总值有一千九百多亿元。从十月中旬起，张家口和石家庄等地的七个国营百货公司，在当地人民政府财政经济委员会的领导下，先后举行了国营公司、合作社内部商品交流会。各基层供销合作社在交流会上进货时，都增加了品种。
    十月下旬以来，河北各地广泛举行了物资交流会，使商品和农民见了面。以基层供销合作社为单位、集镇和庙会为销货重点的农村小型物资交流会也在各地陆续举行。
    现在，各地上层商品积压、下层商品脱销的情况已经开始有了转变。据九个百货分公司的统计，城市商品库存占城乡总库存的比重，已经由百分之五十四点八四下降到百分之四十九点六二；一百二十三个县商店的库存，十月份比九月份上升了百分之二十一点六。许多地区由于基层销货单位物资增加，工业品在农村的销售数量显著上升。石家庄专区二十五个县百货商店十月下旬的销售额，就比十月上旬增加了百分之七十四。（冀新）
    自十月一日到十一月十日不完全统计，湖南省国营商业部门下调到各地城镇和农村的布匹、百货、食盐、药品等各种商品已有五万六千九百多吨。
    为了及时满足广大农民在出售粮食、油料等农产品后，对日用品的需要，湖南省人民政府商业厅在十月下旬专门成立了物资调运办公室，根据各地库存情况和各地群众需要，编制了商品调运计划。对各地农民目前最需要的棉布、棉花、针织品、棉织品、食盐等商品都优先调运。现在下调到农村的商品中，仅冬袜就有三十多万打，毛线十三万五千多磅和食糖一千二百多吨。省商业厅还抽调了近四百个商业工作干部分赴各地协助商品推销工作。衡阳专区国营商业部门最近还组织了四百多个货郎担送货下乡。（新华社）
