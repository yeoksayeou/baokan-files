The victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution opened a new era in the relationship between the Russian and Chinese peoples. The October Revolution laid the foundation for a great friendship between the two peoples, a friendship that now not only has a positive impact on the destiny of the Soviet and Chinese peoples, but also on the destiny of all the peoples of the world. This friendship powerfully strikes at the entire imperialist system and brings the dawn of liberation to the peoples of colonial countries and dependent states suffering from imperialist oppression.

The Russian Revolution of October 1917 created decisive preconditions for the entry of the struggle of all peoples against imperialism into a new stage.

From the very first days of the October Revolution, the Soviet government has consistently and resolutely struggled to withdraw from the imperialist war, to strive for the establishment of universal peace on a democratic basis, to expose all imperialist aggressors, and to establish new friendly relations with neighboring countries on the principles of equality, mutual trust, mutual respect, and friendship.

The victory of the October Revolution in the struggle against Russian imperialism and international imperialism inspired the oppressed peoples with the conviction that they would win the struggle for freedom and independence.

The dawn of freedom also shone on the Chinese people.

Under the direct influence of the October Revolution, the Chinese people intensified their struggle for national and social liberation. The May Fourth anti-imperialist movement in 1919 was a decisive starting point for this struggle. The revolutionary Chinese proletariat led this movement and established its own Communist Party in July 1921. The Russian working class sympathized with the Chinese people's liberation struggle very early on. As early as January 1912, the resolution adopted by the Sixth All-Russian Bolshevik Party Congress held in Prague emphasized:
	“The revolutionary struggle of the Chinese people is of world significance. It can bring liberation to Asia and destroy the rule of the European bourgeoisie.” The congress condemned the position of the Russian bourgeois liberals in supporting the Tsarist government's policy of aggression. After the victory of the proletariat in October 1917, the Soviet government resolutely abolished the secret treaties signed in the past, the occupied territories of other countries, and the enslaving agreements signed. The Soviet government issued a declaration to the Chinese people on July 25, 1919, announcing the policy of friendship between the Soviet and Chinese peoples and recognizing it as the basis for the future relationship between the two peoples. This policy was confirmed in the declaration issued by the Soviet government on September 27, 1920, and in other documents.

In 1921, Sun Yat-sen and the then People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic exchanged friendly letters.

Under the pressure of the Chinese people, the Beijing government signed the Sino-Soviet Treaty on May 31, 1924. Article 4 of the treaty re-emphasized that all treaties and agreements that previously hindered China's sovereignty and interests were invalid. This treaty established friendly and equal relations between Soviet Russia and China and dealt a severe blow to imperialism and its attempts to invade China. For this reason, the great Chinese democrat and patriot Sun Yat-sen wrote to the Soviet government on March 11, 1925, before his death, expressing his hope that Soviet Russia and free China could join hands in the great struggle for the freedom of the oppressed nations of the world to achieve victory. Sun Yat-sen's prediction came true. In the course of its great revolution, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, have been constantly inspired by the revolutionary experience of the Soviet people. The theory of Marxism-Leninism is of great significance to the Chinese proletariat and its revolutionary party, and the party has regarded mastering this theory as the most powerful weapon in the struggle against imperialism in the past and now. Comrade Mao Zedong, the leader of the Party, regarded the study of the ideas and experience of the Russian revolution as the most important task of the Chinese Communists, and called on them to "take the Russian road." The slogan "Learn from the Soviet Union" has been widely spread. The Soviet Union's unswerving foreign policy of peace has gained great prestige and has been welcomed. The Chinese people are convinced from their own experience that the Soviet people have provided selfless and genuine assistance to the Chinese people in their struggle for freedom and national independence. Only the Soviet Union condemned Japan's aggression against China, which was supported by American and Western European imperialism. The Soviet Union's great victory over German fascism and Japanese imperialism inspired the Chinese people to carry out a resolute struggle to establish a truly people's country. As a result of the victory of this struggle, China broke away from the imperialist system and entered the great camp of peace, democracy and socialism headed by the Soviet Union. The establishment of the People's Republic of China is the inevitable result of the victory of the struggle of the forces of people's democracy against the forces of imperialist aggression. The great October Socialist Revolution gave this struggle a great impetus. The People's Republic of China, based on the ideas and experience of the October Socialist Revolution and creatively applying Marxism-Leninism, has made tremendous achievements in economic and cultural construction. The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance has played and will continue to play a huge role in these achievements. The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance signed on February 14, 1950, proves the victory of the new mutual relations between the two peoples, which were laid down by the Great October Socialist Revolution. The unbreakable and increasingly consolidated friendship between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China is a strong bastion of world peace and security.

The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, as well as the recent joint communiqué of the Sino-Soviet governments, clearly show to all countries that these agreements are fundamentally different from the unequal treaties by which the imperialists bound backward countries.

Now the People's Republic of China is an indivisible part of the mighty camp of peace, democracy and socialism. Mutual support between the peoples of the countries in this camp is the law of our lives. The friendly cooperation between the peoples of the countries in this camp is the foundation of the happiness of our next generation, the peaceful prosperity of our country and the victory of socialism, the guarantee of victory for the peoples of all countries who are still suffering from imperialist oppression, and the pillar of our struggle for world peace and security.

Long live the eternal and unbreakable brotherly friendship between the Soviet and Chinese peoples!

    伟大的十月社会主义革命的胜利和苏中两国人民友谊的加强
    苏联科学院院士　潘克拉托娃
    伟大的十月社会主义革命为俄罗斯人民同中国人民之间的相互关系开辟了一个新的纪元。十月革命给两国人民之间的伟大友谊奠定了一个开端，这种友谊在现在不仅对苏中两国人民的命运发生良好影响，同时对全世界人民的命运也发生良好影响。这种友谊有力地打击了整个帝国主义体系，并给遭受帝国主义压迫的殖民地国家和附属国人民带来了解放的曙光。
    一九一七年十月的俄国革命为各国人民同帝国主义的斗争进入到一个新的阶段创造了有决定意义的前提。
    苏维埃政府从十月革命的最初时日起，就始终不渝地、坚决地为退出帝国主义战争、争取在民主的基础上建立普遍的和平、为揭发一切帝国主义侵略者，以及为在平等、互相信任、互相尊重和友好的原则上建立新的同邻国友好的关系进行了斗争。
    十月革命在反对俄国帝国主义和国际帝国主义的斗争中所获得的胜利，鼓舞了被压迫的各国人民对于争取自由和独立的斗争获得胜利的信念。
    自由的曙光也照耀到中国人民。
    中国人民在十月革命的直接影响下，加紧进行了争取民族解放和社会解放的斗争。一九一九年的“五四”反帝运动是这一斗争的有决定意义的起点。革命的中国无产阶级领导了这一运动，并于一九二一年七月成立了自己的共产党。俄国工人阶级很早就同情中国人民的解放斗争。早在一九一二年一月，在布拉格召开的第六次全俄布尔什维克党代表会议所通过的决议中就强调指出：
  “中国人民革命斗争是具有世界意义的，它能给亚洲带来解放并摧毁欧洲资产阶级的统治。”代表会议痛斥了俄国资产阶级自由主义分子支持沙皇政府侵略政策的立场。一九一七年十月无产阶级取得胜利后，苏维埃政府坚决废除了过去签订的秘密条约、占领的他国的领土以及签订的奴役性协定。苏维埃政府在一九一九年七月二十五日发出了对中国人民的宣言，宣布了苏中两国人民友好的政策，并认定它是两国人民今后相互关系的基础。苏维埃政府在一九二○年九月二十七日发表的宣言以及其他文件中都证实了这一政策。
  一九二一年孙中山和俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国当时的外交人民委员会互通了友好信函。
      北京政府在中国人民的压力之下，于一九二四年五月三十一日签订了中苏条约，在条约的第四条中重新强调以前妨碍到中国主权和中国利益的一切条约和协定全部无效。这一条约建立了苏维埃俄罗斯同中国之间友好的平等的关系，并给帝国主义及其侵略中国的企图以严重的打击。正因如此，伟大的中国民主主义者和爱国者孙中山在一九二五年三月十一日临终前写信给苏维埃政府，表示希望苏维埃俄罗斯和自由的中国能在争取世界被压迫民族自由的伟大斗争中携手并进，以取得胜利。孙中山的预言实现了。中国人民在其伟大的革命过程中，在共产党的领导下，经常受到苏联人民革命经验的鼓舞。马克思列宁主义的理论对中国无产阶级及其革命政党具有着非常重大的意义，党在过去和现在都把掌握这种理论认为是同帝国主义进行斗争的最有力的武器。党的领袖毛泽东同志在当时和现在都把学习俄国革命的思想和经验认作是中国共产党员最主要的任务，并号召他们“走俄国人的路”。“向苏联学习”的口号已经是非常广泛地传布开来了。苏联坚持不渝的爱好和平的对外政策获得了巨大的威信并受到了欢迎。中国人民从自己的切身体验中，确信苏联人民在中国人民争取自由和民族独立的斗争中给予无私的真正的援助。只有苏联指责了为美国及西欧帝国主义支持的日本对中国的侵略。苏联战胜德国法西斯和日本帝国主义的伟大胜利，鼓舞中国人民为建立真正人民的国家进行坚决的斗争。由于这一斗争的胜利，中国脱离了帝国主义体系而进入了以苏联为首的伟大的和平、民主和社会主义阵营。中华人民共和国的成立是人民民主力量反对帝国主义侵略势力斗争胜利的必然结果。伟大的十月社会主义革命给了这个斗争以巨大的推动力量。中华人民共和国根据十月社会主义革命的思想和经验并创造性地运用了马克思列宁主义，在经济和文化建设各方面都取得了巨大的成就。中苏友好同盟互助条约对这些成就曾经起了和将来还要起着巨大的作用。一九五○年二月十四日签订的中苏友好同盟互助条约证明了两国人民之间新的相互关系的胜利，这种关系是伟大的十月社会主义革命所奠定起来的。苏联同中华人民共和国之间的牢不可破的日益巩固的友谊是世界和平和安全的坚强的堡垒。
    中苏友好同盟互助条约以及最近中苏两国政府会谈公报，清楚地向各国说明，这些协定同帝国主义者束缚落后国家的不平等条约是根本不同的。
    现在中华人民共和国是强大的和平、民主和社会主义阵营的不可分割的组成部分。这一阵营中各国人民之间的相互支持是我们生活的规律。这一阵营中各国人民之间的友好合作是我们下一代的幸福，我们国家的和平繁荣和社会主义胜利的基础，是还在遭受着帝国主义压迫的各国人民取得胜利的保证，是我们争取全世界人民和平与安全的斗争的支柱。
    苏中两国人民之间永恒的，牢不可破的兄弟般的友谊万岁！
