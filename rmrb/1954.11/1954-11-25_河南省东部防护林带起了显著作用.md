The struggle to build shelterbelts and overcome sandstorms has achieved success in the area east of Zhengzhou, Henan Province. The eastern Henan shelterbelts along the old course of the Yellow River and the Longhai Railway have protected an area of over 3 million mu of land.

Due to the Yellow River's repeated course changes and constant breaches, over 4 million mu of sandy and alkaline wasteland was created in a dozen counties in eastern Henan. In the past, during the winter and spring seasons, wind and sandstorms engulfed crops and houses like floods, forcing many farmers to flee in search of food. After liberation, the Party and the People's Government led the masses in eastern Henan to carry out a large-scale afforestation campaign, determined to overcome the harm caused by wind and sand. As of this year, a total of more than 332,000 mu of forest have been planted. The five main shelterbelts that have been completed are more than 1,100 li long, including one from Zhengzhou to Huaiyang that is more than 500 li long, with a width of up to 20 li in some places. The trees are generally three to four meters high, with the tallest reaching seven to eight meters. The protected area has reached more than 3 million mu.

After the shelterbelts grew, many sandy beaches were reclaimed and cultivated. In Tucheng Township, a suburb of Kaifeng City where wheat had never been grown before, more than 4,000 mu of wheat were planted this year, with an average yield of 110 jin per mu, and a maximum of 350 jin. The cotton planted within the forest network yielded more than 10 jin of ginned cotton per mu, and the quality was very good. In Yifeng Village, Lankao County, the 2,400 mu of fruit trees planted within the forest network have begun to yield a large harvest this year.

The lives of the people in eastern Henan have also undergone tremendous changes. In Yifeng Village, Lankao County, the center of the sandy area, in 1950, more than 50 households had only 20 livestock and one cart, and harvested 18 shi of grain throughout the year. This year, the village harvested more than 100 shi of wheat, the number of livestock has increased to more than 60, and four more carts and six stone mills have been added. (Cui Silan)

    河南省东部防护林带起了显著作用
    营造防护林战胜黄砂的斗争，在河南省郑州以东地区获得成绩，沿着黄河故道和陇海铁路两旁的豫东防护林带，已防护了三百多万亩土地的面积。
    由于黄河历次改道和不断决口，在豫东十数县内造成了四百多万亩砂荒和碱荒。这些地区，过去一到冬春季节，风砂像洪流一样吞没着庄稼和房屋，很多农民被逼得四出逃荒。解放后，党和人民政府领导豫东群众开展了大规模的造林运动，决心战胜风砂带来的危害。到今年为止，共已造林三十三万二千多亩。已完成的五条基干防护林带，全长一千一百多华里，其中从郑州到淮阳的一条有五百多华里，宽处达二十华里。树木一般高达三、四公尺，最高的七、八公尺。防护的面积已达三百多万亩。
    防护林成长后，使很多沙滩被垦植起来，不曾种过麦子的开封市郊土城乡，今年已种到了四千多亩小麦，每亩平均收麦一百一十斤，最高达三百五十斤。林网内种植的棉花，每亩收皮棉十多斤，质量很好。兰考县仪封村在林网内种植的两千四百亩果树，今年已开始大量收获。
    豫东人民生活也起了巨大的变化。砂区中心的兰考县仪封村，一九五零年时，五十多户人家只有二十头牲口和一辆大车，全年收获十八石粮食。今年全村收了一百多石麦子，牲口增加到六十多头，并添了四辆大车，六盘石磨。　（崔思岚）
