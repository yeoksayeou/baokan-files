Xinhua News Agency, 13th: According to a TASS report: The Soviet Union has begun constructing railways and highways in reclaimed areas to promote grain production and the development of other economic sectors in these regions.

A total of eight narrow-gauge railways, with a total length of approximately two thousand kilometers, will be built in the northern reclaimed areas of the Kazakh Republic. The longest of these, the Kustanai-Kokchetav railway, is four hundred and fifty kilometers long and will pass through the largest grain-producing areas of the Kustanai, Kokchetav, and Akmolinsk regions. The remaining seven railways will also serve as economic arteries connecting the reclaimed areas of northern Kazakhstan with other regions. Route surveys are currently underway for these eight railways, and construction of the roadbed has already begun in some sections of the Kustanai-Kokchetav line. A total of eight hundred kilometers of these new railway lines are scheduled to open to traffic before the start of the 1955 harvest season. This will enable large quantities of grain produced in the new grain-producing areas of northern Kazakhstan to be rapidly transported to major cities and industrial areas along the lines. In conjunction with the construction of railways, highways are also being built in the northern reclaimed areas of Kazakhstan, with plans to complete more than two thousand kilometers of highways in the next two years.

The Karasuk station on the Omsk railway line in Siberia welcomed a large group of construction workers on October 31st. They are preparing to build a railway from Karasuk to Kamen-na-Obi in the Altai Territory. This railway, part of the planned Mid-Siberian Railway (from Omsk to Barnaul), is two hundred and fifty kilometers long. It will pass through the Novosibirsk region and the Altai Territory, where large-scale land reclamation is underway, and will serve as an economic artery for the largest new grain-producing areas in these two regions. The route survey for the Karasuk-Kamen railway is nearing completion.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 13th: According to TASS reports from Moscow: Collective farms throughout the Soviet Union have recently completed hundreds of new cultural buildings. Many collective farms celebrated the thirty-seventh anniversary of the October Revolution in newly built farm clubs this year.

There are now more than one hundred and thirteen thousand clubs and cultural palaces in the Soviet countryside. The number of libraries and reading rooms is also increasing rapidly. There are now twenty-two thousand mobile film projection units in rural areas, and fifteen thousand collective farms have cinemas. Many collective farm clubs have also established rural music schools, allowing farmers' children with musical talent to learn piano, violin, accordion, and other instruments. Clubs in hundreds of collective farms in the Moscow, Leningrad, and Kiev regions have also installed radio televisions. This makes it possible for collective farmers in remote rural areas to see wonderful programs staged in major theaters in Moscow and other large cities.

The Soviet state allocates increasing funds each year to develop rural cultural and educational undertakings. Illiteracy has long been eliminated in the Soviet countryside, and children of ordinary farmers are now universally receiving secondary and higher education. With the development of rural cultural and educational undertakings, the number of intellectuals in rural areas has been increasing. The number of teachers and doctors in the Soviet countryside is now more than seven times that of 1913 before the revolution, and the number of agronomists and other experts is more than thirty times greater.

Xinhua News Agency, 13th: According to Soviet newspaper reports: Machine tractor stations throughout the Soviet Union have completed their annual tractor work quotas ahead of schedule. By November 5th, the amount of work they completed for collective farms, converted into arable land, had increased by 67 million hectares (1 hectare equals 15 mu) compared to the same period last year. The machine tractor stations in the Omsk, Leningrad, and Chelyabinsk regions of the Russian Federation completed their annual tractor work plans ahead of schedule on the eve of the October Revolution Day. The machine tractor stations in the Omsk region alone completed 45 percent more tractor work for collective farms this year than last year. In the Kazakh Republic, approximately two hundred machine tractor stations have already completed their annual tractor work plans ahead of schedule, and the average productivity of each tractor has greatly exceeded that of previous years. The machine tractor stations in the Moldavian Republic completed their annual tractor work plan on November 3rd. They cultivated nearly one million hectares of land more for collective farms this year than in the same period last year, and the average workload per tractor increased by sixty hectares. This year, machine tractor stations have performed one hundred and twenty types of field work for collective farms in the republic. As a result of increased mechanization, collective farms in the Moldavian Republic saved an average of ten labor days per hectare of vegetable crops, corn, and sunflowers. In addition, many machine tractor stations in the Frunze region of the Kirghiz Republic and other regions have recently reported that they have completed their annual tractor work plans ahead of schedule.

Constantly strengthening the assistance of machine tractor stations to collective farms and improving the utilization rate of machinery have played a decisive role in completing the task of further developing Soviet collective farm agricultural production this year. For example, as a result of organized spring plowing and sowing and rational use of machinery, the amount of work done by machine tractor stations in collective farm fields during the spring field work period this year (converted into plowing) increased by 18,674,000 hectares compared to last year. This not only enabled collective farms to complete spring plowing and sowing work rapidly within the shortest period stipulated by agricultural technical regulations, but also expanded the sowing area of spring crops, laying a good foundation for increased production of all crops in Soviet collective farms this year. In order to strive for a bumper harvest of all crops in 1955, machine tractor stations in various regions are now helping collective farms to complete the sowing plan for winter crops ahead of schedule, and have plowed 9.3 million hectares more autumn land for collective farms than in the same period last year.

    苏联在开垦地区修建铁路和公路
    【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社消息：苏联开垦地区开始修建铁路和公路，以促进这些地区的谷物生产和其他经济部门的发展。
    哈萨克共和国北部各开垦区共将修建八条总长约两千公里的窄轨铁路。其中最长的库斯坦奈—柯克齐塔夫铁路长达四百五十公里，它将通过库斯坦奈、柯克齐塔夫和阿克摩林斯克等三个州的最大的产粮区。其余七条铁路也将成为沟通哈萨克北部各垦区和其他地区的经济动脉。这八条铁路现在正在勘测路线，库斯坦奈—柯克齐塔夫铁路线上部分地区的路基修建工程已经动工。到一九五五年收获季节开始前，这些新铁路线总共将有八百公里开始通车。这一来，哈萨克共和国北部新产粮区出产的粮食，就可以大量迅速地运往沿线各重要城市和工业区。和修建铁路同时，哈萨克北部各开垦地区现在还正在修筑公路，在今后两年内将修成两千多公里的公路。
    西伯利亚的鄂木斯克铁路线上的卡拉苏克车站，在十月三十一日到达了一批人数很多的建设人员。他们准备从卡拉苏克到阿尔泰边疆区卡明城修建一条铁路。这条铁路是计划修建的中西伯利亚铁路线（从鄂木斯克到巴尔瑙尔）的一部分，共长二百五十公里。它将通过正在大规模开垦荒地的新西伯利亚州和阿尔泰边疆区，成为这两个地区的最大的新产粮区的经济动脉。现在，卡拉苏克—卡明铁路的路线勘测工作即将完成。
    【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联各地集体农庄最近又建成了几百个新的文化建筑物。许多集体农庄今年都在新建的农庄俱乐部内庆祝十月革命三十七周年。
    苏联农村的俱乐部和文化宫现在已增加到十一万三千个以上。图书馆、阅览室也增加得很快。农村里现在有二万二千个流动电影放映设备，有一万五千个集体农庄还设有电影院。许多集体农庄俱乐部还设立了农村音乐学校，让有音乐天才的农民子女学习钢琴、提琴、手风琴和其他乐器。莫斯科、列宁格勒和基辅等州几百个集体农庄的俱乐部还装置了无线电电视机。这一来，就使得在遥远的农村中的集体农民们，也可以看到莫斯科和其他大城市各大剧院上演的精彩节目。
    苏维埃国家每年都拨出越来越多的经费，以发展农村文化教育事业。苏联农村中早已消灭了文盲，普通农民的子女现在普遍都在受中等和高等教育。随着农村文化教育事业的发展，农村中的知识分子已日益增多。现在苏联农村中的教师和医生已增加为革命前一九一三年的七倍以上，农艺师和其他专家已增加为三十倍以上。
    【新华社十三日讯】据苏联报纸消息：苏联各地机器拖拉机站纷纷提前完成今年的拖拉机工作量，到十一月五日，它们为集体农庄完成的工作量，折合成耕地计算，已比去年同时期增加了六千七百万公顷（每公顷合十五市亩）。俄罗斯联邦的鄂木斯克、列宁格勒和车里雅宾斯克等州的机器拖拉机站早在十月革命节前夕就提前完成了全年的拖拉机工作量计划。其中，单是鄂木斯克州的机器拖拉机站今年为集体农庄做的拖拉机工作量，就比去年增加了百分之四十五。在哈萨克共和国现在已约有二百个机器拖拉机站提前完成全年的拖拉机工作量计划，它们的每台拖拉机的平均生产率都大大超过了往年。摩尔达维亚共和国的机器拖拉机站，在十一月三日已全部完成了今年的拖拉机工作量计划。它们今年已比去年同时期为集体农庄多耕作了将近一百万公顷的土地，每台拖拉机的平均工作量增加了六十公顷。今年，机器拖拉机站为共和国各集体农庄所作的田间工作达一百二十种。由于提高机械化程度的结果，摩尔达维亚共和国的集体农庄今年单是中耕一公顷蔬菜作物、玉蜀黍和向日葵，就平均为集体农庄节省了十个劳动日。此外，吉尔吉斯共和国的伏龙芝州和其他地区最近也传来了许多机器拖拉机站提前完成全年拖拉机工作量计划的消息。
    不断加强机器拖拉机站对集体农庄的帮助并提高机器设备利用率，对完成今年进一步发展苏联集体农庄农业生产的任务起了决定性的作用。例如，由于有组织地进行春耕、春播工作并合理地使用机器的结果，今年春季田间工作期间，各地机器拖拉机站在集体农庄田间所做的工作量（折合成犁地计算），就比去年增加了一千八百六十七万四千公顷，这不仅使集体农庄春耕春播工作能够在农业技术规程规定的最短的期限内迅速完成，而且还扩大了春播作物的播种面积，为今年苏联集体农庄一切农作物的增产打下了良好的基础。各地机器拖拉机站为了争取一九五五年一切农作物的丰收，现在又帮助集体农庄及时超额完成了冬季作物的播种计划，为集体农庄翻耕好的秋耕地已比去年同时期多九百三十万公顷。
