Hubei Province's aquatic and native product departments and cooperatives in areas along the Yangtze River and around the lakes are vigorously helping disaster victims and fishermen promote aquatic products. The Hubei Provincial People's Government Aquatic Products Bureau has allocated more than 20 billion yuan in funds and loans in batches for the purchase of aquatic products. In early October, the Hubei Provincial Aquatic Products Joint Sales Office transported more than 45,000 jin of fresh fish to Beijing, Xi'an, Taiyuan, and Shenyang. These fresh fish have sold well in various places. The Northwest and other regions have sent letters requesting continued supply. Changchun, Harbin, and other places have sent people to negotiate the purchase of aquatic products. The Hubei Provincial Aquatic Products Joint Sales Office has signed sales contracts with Beijing, Taiyuan, and other places, and will supply a large number of aquatic products to various places as soon as the aquatic product peak season arrives.

This year, the fish production in disaster-stricken areas of Hubei Province is very high. It is estimated that the province can produce 500 million jin of fish from August this year to May next year. The number of people fishing this year has also increased compared to previous years. Most disaster victims take fishing as their main sideline production. Including the original fishermen, more than 1.3 million people have gone to the lakes to fish. Currently, Jingzhou Prefecture has more than 500,000 jin of fresh fish on the market every day. Hubei Province's aquatic and native product departments and cooperatives have clearly divided the labor and are responsible for the purchase and promotion of aquatic products. The aquatic products department has decided to set up five new aquatic product companies, one hundred and ninety-six purchasing stations, supply and marketing stations, and more than four hundred purchasing points in disaster areas. Cooperatives and state-owned native product companies' branches in disaster areas have also increased their aquatic product business to help disaster victims and fishermen promote aquatic products. The Hubei Provincial People's Government Finance and Economics Committee has uniformly formulated reasonable purchase prices for aquatic products to ensure the income of disaster victims and fishermen. During the period of the Jiang thief clique's rule in 1931, after Hubei Province suffered a major flood, disaster victims in Hanchuan, Wuchang, and other counties closer to Wuhan City needed six or seven jin of fresh fish to exchange for one jin of rice. In the more distant Jingzhou Prefecture, fish prices were even lower. Now, disaster victims and fishermen can sell aquatic products at an average price of one jin of fresh fish for one jin of rice.

Currently, the water levels of the rivers and lakes have not yet returned to normal, and the fish production is not yet at its peak season. It is estimated that in the next three or four months, the average daily market supply of fresh fish will increase by 60% to 80% compared to now. At present, relevant departments in various places are further preparing for the large-scale listing of aquatic products. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 湖北省努力帮助灾民和渔民推销水产品

    湖北省努力帮助灾民和渔民推销水产品
    湖北省沿江和滨湖地区的水产、土产部门和合作社正大力帮助灾民、渔民推销水产品。湖北省人民政府水产局分批拨出收购水产品资金和贷款二百多亿元。湖北省水产品联合推销办事处在十月上旬运往北京、西安、太原和沈阳等地的鲜鱼达四万五千多斤。这些鲜鱼在各地的销售情况良好。西北等地已来信要求继续供应。长春、哈尔滨等地已派人前来接洽采购水产品。湖北省水产品联合推销办事处已和北京、太原等地订了购销合同，只等水产旺季到来，将大量供应各地水产品。
    今年湖北省受灾地区鱼产量很大，估计从今年八月到明年五月全省能产鱼五亿斤。今年捕鱼人数也比往年增多，大多数灾民都以捕鱼为主要副业生产，现在连原有渔民在内已经有一百三十多万人下湖捕鱼。荆州专区目前每天有五十多万斤鲜鱼上市。湖北省水产、土产部门和合作社已明确分工，负责收购和推销水产品。水产部门决定在灾区新设五个水产公司、一百九十六个收购站、供销站和四百多个收购点。灾区各合作社和国营土产公司分、支机构也增加了水产业务，帮助灾民、渔民推销水产品。湖北省人民政府财政经济委员会统一制订了合理的水产品收购价格，保证灾民、渔民收益。在一九三一年蒋贼集团统治时期，湖北省遭受大水灾之后，当时离武汉市较近的汉川、武昌等县灾民需用六、七斤鲜鱼才能换到一斤大米，较远的荆州专区各地鱼价更低。现在灾民、渔民平均都能按一斤鲜鱼换一斤大米的价格出售水产品。
    目前江、湖水位尚未正常，鱼产还不是最旺的季节，估计在今后的三、四个月内鲜鱼平均每日上市量要比现在增加百分之六十到八十。现各地有关部门正进一步作好各种准备工作，迎接大量水产品上市。　（新华社）
