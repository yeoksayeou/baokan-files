Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 15th: Vietnam News Agency, Hanoi, November 14th: The International Supervisory and Control Commission in Vietnam issued a public statement to the press on November 12th, refuting the fabricated news spread by certain American and French newspapers and radio stations that the International Commission had permitted French warships to enter the territorial waters of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

The public statement first said: "News reports and radio broadcasts, especially those published by the Associated Press and Agence France-Presse on November 10, 1954, mentioned that the International Commission had allegedly made a decision to allow French warships to enter the territorial waters of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to rescue Catholic refugees. This report is completely unfounded."

The public statement continued: "The International Commission has not made any decision on this matter and has never made any recommendations to any party. It is understood that the French authorities formally contacted the authorities of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam requesting such facilities, but this request was rejected."

The public statement concluded: "In the past three months of work, all decisions made by the International Commission in Vietnam have been reached by unanimous agreement, and there has never been a situation where decisions were passed by voting."

This is not the first time that American and French news agencies have published such fabricated reports in an attempt to conceal the conspiracies and activities of the U.S. imperialists and the French side to sabotage the armistice agreement, infringe upon the sovereignty and territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and create difficulties in fulfilling the armistice agreement.

Everyone remembers that not long ago, American and French radio stations also broadcast that 4,000 people had gathered on the coast of Quan Dien in Thai Binh province, waiting to be evacuated to South Vietnam, and that the authorities of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam refused to allow French warships to carry out "rescue" operations. However, when the International Commission inspection team arrived in Quan Dien on November 11 for an on-the-spot investigation, the facts proved that these broadcasts were fabricated.

The above facts show that the distorted propaganda of reactionary news agencies, aimed at slandering the policies of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and creating a tense situation unfavorable to the implementation of the armistice agreement, has failed and is destined to suffer even more severe failures.

    越南国际委员会驳斥美、法通讯社的造谣
    【新华社十五日讯】越南通讯社河内十四日讯：越南国际监督和监察委员会在十一月十二日向报界发表公报。驳斥美国和法国某些报纸和电台上所说国际委员会已准许法国军舰进入越南民主共和国领海的消息是捏造的。
    公报首先说：“新闻报道和电台广播，特别是合众社和法新社在一九五四年十一月十日所发表的新闻报道，提到国际委员会据说曾作出决定，准许法国军舰进入越南民主共和国的领海搭救天主教徒难民。这项报道是毫无根据的。
    公报又说：“国际委员会对这件事没有作出任何决定，并且从来没有向任何一方提出任何建议。据悉，法国当局曾向越南民主共和国当局正式接洽，要求给予这种方便，但是这项请求被拒绝了。
    公报最后说：“在过去三个月的工作中，越南国际委员会所作出的一切决定都是经过一致的同意的，至今还没有发生过以投票方式来通过决定的情况。”
    美国和法国通讯社发表这种捏造的报道，企图掩饰美帝国主义者以及法方破坏停战协定、侵犯越南民主共和国的主权和领土、以及为履行停战协定制造困难的阴谋和活动，这已不是第一次了。
    大家记得，不久以前，美国和法国的电台也曾广播说，四千个人曾聚集在太平省的昆典海岸，等待撤退到南越去，并且说，越南民主共和国当局拒绝准许法国军舰进行“拯救”。但是，当国际委员会视察小组在十一月十一日来到昆典作实地调查时，事实证明这些广播都是捏造的。
    上述事实表明，反动通讯社为了诬蔑越南民主共和国政府的政策和制造不利于履行停战协定的紧张局势的歪曲宣传已经失败了，并且注定将遭到更惨重的失败。
