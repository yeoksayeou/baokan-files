    陕西省陆续调出粮食支援工业建设和灾区
    陕西省调出大批粮食支援城市工业建设和灾区的农民。今年七月到十月份，全省先后调出粮食十一万八千四百多吨；其中第三季度调出的粮食，比去年同时期增加六万九千四百多吨。陕西省外运的粮食主要是小麦，这些小麦大部分调运到北京；陕西省调出的大米供给青海省和甘肃省；有名的关中“碧蚂一号”小麦也运往河南、安徽等省，帮助灾区农民解决籽种问题。
    今年陕西省广大地区粮食丰收。关中地区十七个国营农场的小麦，平均每亩产量有三百五十多斤；汉中专区褒城县许家街村的水稻，平均每亩产量达七百五十多斤，同时还出现了十多个平均每亩产千斤以上的丰产户。现在全省各地农民正积极缴纳公粮和出卖余粮。陕西省粮食厅正在有计划地进行粮食调运工作。（本报陕西记者站）
