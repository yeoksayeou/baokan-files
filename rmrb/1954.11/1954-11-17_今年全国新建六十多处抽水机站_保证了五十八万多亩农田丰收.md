    This year, more than sixty pumping stations have been built across the country, equipped with more than 700 pumps (with a power of 14,000 horsepower), benefiting a total of more than 580,000 mu of farmland. Together with the past, there are now more than 9,000 pumps in the country, totaling more than 160,000 horsepower, irrigating and draining more than 5.59 million mu of farmland.

    These newly built and expanded pumping stations this year are mostly located in areas prone to drought and flooding, where it is difficult to use manual labor and animal power for water lifting. After the stations were built, drought and flood disasters that had lasted for many years were eliminated, ensuring bumper harvests on the benefited fields. Shang Xiuli Enclosure in Gaoming County, Guangdong Province, is located in a low-lying area, and yields are reduced every year in the early rice season and lost in the late rice season. When the station was built in April this year, more than 4,000 mu of rice fields within the enclosure were already submerged in water, but as soon as the machines started, more than 300,000 tons of water were discharged from the enclosure into the Xijiang River every day, finally overcoming the flood.

    The establishment of pumping stations has saved a large amount of manpower and animal power for agricultural processing, promoting the development of the patriotic production increase movement. In the Jinshanwei irrigation area of the Songjiang Pumping Station in Jiangsu Province, with the support of mechanized irrigation tools, a surge of agricultural technology reform has been initiated. The Jinwei and Jinxing agricultural producers' cooperatives and a mutual aid group (composed of three permanent mutual aid teams) have planted more than 140 mu of rice this year. Generally, the fields are deeply ploughed to a depth of five or six inches.

    With the establishment of pumping stations, the socialist consciousness of farmers in various places has been raised, and the mutual aid and cooperation movement has been further developed. Farmers in the newly built pumping station irrigation areas in Zhejiang Province said that socialism is near! In the process of building the Yinjiang Pumping Station irrigation area, mutual aid groups rapidly developed from five to fifty-one, and three new agricultural producers' cooperatives were established. In Nanchong City, Sichuan Province, the number of agricultural producers' cooperatives in Duwei Township increased from three to thirteen, and six villages in Duwei Township have basically been cooperativized. Ninety-five percent of the farmers in Niuwuba have participated in mutual aid and cooperative organizations.

    今年全国新建六十多处抽水机站
    保证了五十八万多亩农田丰收
    【本报讯】全国各地今年已建成六十多处抽水机站，装备有七百多台抽水机（一万四千马力的动力），受益农田共有五十八万多亩。连同过去，全国已共有抽水机约九千多台，计十六多万马力，在五百五十九万多亩农田上进行灌溉和排水。
    今年新建和扩建的这些抽水机站，大都设置在易旱易涝、用人力畜力车水比较困难的地方，建站后，消灭了多少年来的旱涝灾害，保证了受益田亩的丰收。广东省高明县的上秀丽围，地势低洼，每年早造减产，晚造失收。今年四月建站时，围内已有四千多亩秧田淹没在水里，但是机器一开动，一天就有三十多万吨的水从围内排泄到西江中去，终于战胜了涝灾。
    抽水机站的建立，节省出大量的人力畜力投入农业加工，推动了爱国增产运动的开展。江苏省松江抽水机站的金山卫灌区，在机械化的灌溉工具的支援下，掀起了农业技术改革的热潮，金卫、金星两个农业生产合作社和一个互助联组（由三个常年互助组组成），今年就多栽了一百四十多亩水稻。一般田地都深耕到五、六寸。
    随着抽水机站的建立，各地农民的社会主义觉悟提高，互助合作运动进一步发展。浙江省新建的抽水机站灌溉区内的农民说，社会主义近了！鄞江抽水机站灌溉区在建站过程中，从五个互助组迅速地发展到五十一个互助组，并新建了三个农业生产合作社。四川省南充市都尉乡农业生产合作社由三个增加到十三个，都尉乡六村已基本合作化。牛五坝百分之九十五的农户都参加了互助合作组织。
