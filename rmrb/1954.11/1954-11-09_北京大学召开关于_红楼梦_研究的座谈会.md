    Peking University's Department of Chinese Language and Literature held a symposium on "Dream of the Red Chamber" research on the 6th. More than 200 professors and researchers from Peking University's Departments of Philosophy, History, and Western Languages, as well as the Peking University Institute of Literature, and representatives from the Chinese Writers Association participated in the symposium.

    At the symposium, Professors Gao Mingkai, You Guoen, Wei Jiangong, Pu Jiangqing, Lin Geng, Wang Li, Yan Jianbi and others spoke successively. They believed that this discussion on "Dream of the Red Chamber" research was a class struggle in the field of academic thought. The professors said: The existence of bourgeois idealism in some research and teaching work is the poisonous legacy of Hu Shi's reactionary philosophy. The speakers analyzed and criticized how Hu Shi's position, views, and methods influenced the research of classical literature. Professor You Guoen said that Yu Pingbo had been studying "Dream of the Red Chamber" for thirty years, and his research method, which followed Hu Shi's bourgeois idealist viewpoint, fell into tedious textual research, neglecting the social life reflected in this great realistic work.

    In the symposium, most people gave specific explanations on the harmfulness of bourgeois idealist viewpoints in academic research. They pointed out that the research methods of bourgeois idealism separate academics from politics and research from life. Some people also made criticisms in connection with some of their own erroneous research methods. Everyone unanimously agreed that carrying out discussions on the research of "Dream of the Red Chamber" is an important part of ideological remolding in cultural and educational circles; and believed that in the future, it is necessary to further strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works in order to thoroughly eliminate the bourgeois idealist viewpoint.

    北京大学召开关于“红楼梦”研究的座谈会
    北京大学中国语言文学系在六日召开关于“红楼梦”研究的座谈会。参加座谈会的有北京大学哲学系、历史系、西语系和北京大学文学研究所的教授和研究员以及中国作家协会的代表共二百多人。
    座谈会上，高名凯、游国恩、魏建功、浦江清、林庚、王力、阎简弼等教授相继发言。他们认为这次对于“红楼梦”研究的讨论，是学术思想领域中的一次阶级斗争。教授们说：资产阶级唯心论在一些研究工作和教学工作中的存在，是胡适的反动哲学的遗毒。发言者对胡适的立场、观点和方法怎样影响了古典文学的研究进行了分析批判。游国恩教授说：俞平伯研究“红楼梦”有三十年，他沿袭着胡适的资产阶级唯心观点的研究方法陷于繁琐的考证，忽视了这一部伟大的现实主义作品所反映的社会生活。
    在座谈中，大多数人对资产阶级唯心观点在学术研究中的危害性作了具体说明。他们指出：资产阶级唯心观点的研究方法使学术脱离政治，研究脱离生活。有的人并联系到自己的一些错误研究方法作了批判。大家一致认为开展对“红楼梦”研究的讨论，是文化教育界思想改造的一个重要内容；并认为今后必须进一步加强对马克思列宁主义和毛泽东著作的学习，才能彻底肃清资产阶级的唯心观点。（新华社）
