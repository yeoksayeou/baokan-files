Anshan Iron and Steel Works Steel Plant exceeded the national October plan by 4.38%. The quality of the steel was 0.8% higher than the national plan. A total of 81 heats of rapid steelmaking occurred in the plant throughout the month, an increase of 117% compared to September, creating a new record for rapid steelmaking in the past ten months. This month, all plant employees studied advanced Soviet furnace methods, implemented on-carriage ingot casting, and paid attention to shortening melting time and strengthening the unity of the three shifts. At the same time, the sulfur content of molten iron supplied to the plant by the ironmaking plant gradually decreased. The qualification rate of molten iron in October increased by 18.7% compared to August, which played an important role in completing the plan and increasing the number of rapid steelmaking furnaces.

    鞍钢炼钢厂超额完成十月份国家计划
    鞍钢炼钢厂超额百分之四点三八完成了十月份国家计划，钢的质量比国家计划提高百分之零点八。该厂全月共出现八十一炉快速炼钢，比九月份增加了百分之一百一十七，创造了十个月来的快速炼钢新纪录。在这个月里，全厂职工学习了苏联先进的炼炉方法，实行了车上铸锭，并注意缩短熔化时间，加强了三班团结；同时炼铁厂供给该厂的制钢铁水含硫率逐渐降低，十月份铁水的合格率比八月份提高百分之十八点七，这对完成计划和增加快速炼钢炉数都起了重要的作用。　（本报辽宁记者站）
