The Sino-Soviet Communiqué, marking a new development in the great friendship between China and the Soviet Union, has been wholeheartedly endorsed by all employees of the Sino-Soviet Joint-Stock Shipbuilding and Ship Repair Company in Dalian. All Chinese employees are determined to systematically summarize the various advanced experiences taught by Soviet experts before the Soviet shares are transferred to our country, in order to further master Soviet advanced technology and enterprise management methods.

Under the sincere assistance of the Soviet Union, the Sino-Soviet Joint-Stock Shipbuilding and Ship Repair Company in Dalian has become a powerful force in developing China's shipbuilding industry.

The predecessor of the Sino-Soviet Joint-Stock Shipbuilding and Ship Repair Company in Dalian was the Dalian Shipyard, an enterprise of the Imperial Russian Chinese Eastern Railway system from 1898 to 1904, which was occupied by Japan after the Russo-Japanese War. After the Soviet army liberated Dalian and Lushun in 1945, it was taken over by the Soviet Union. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet government immediately handed it over to our country without compensation. At that time, our country was facing the arduous task of restoring the national economy, and funds, equipment, and manpower were scarce. Therefore, we proposed to the Soviet government the requirement of Sino-Soviet joint ventures. The Soviet government accepted our government's request and established the Sino-Soviet Joint-Stock Shipbuilding and Ship Repair Company on the basis of the Dalian Shipyard, according to the principle of equal rights and joint shares. Over the past few years, the Soviet government has sent hundreds of experts, shipped in a large number of machines, built and expanded many factories, and cultivated a group of cadres who have initially learned to manage modern enterprises. The factory has taken on a new look. In the past, in addition to the relatively complete docks, shipways, machine shops, boiler shops, wood shops, and power plants, many other factory buildings were temporary sheds, and most workers worked in the open air. There were few roads in the factory, and the roadbeds and pavements were very poor, and it was muddy every time it rained. Now, the production, auxiliary, and preparation departments have been comprehensively adjusted. As early as 1948, an independent shipbuilding department was established. From 1950, new shipbuilding workshops were successively built and many other workshops were rebuilt, increasing the production area by 71 percent. New equipment has been added, and wharves, roads, and railways have been opened up, and modern means of transportation can enter some factory buildings. In the machine processing plant, Soviet-style machine tools account for 73 percent. Many parts that could not be manufactured before can now be manufactured, the precision of processing has been improved, and the proportion of manual operation in ship repair and shipbuilding has been greatly reduced. In terms of welding and cutting, automatic and semi-automatic welding machines have been added, saving a lot of labor and ensuring the quality of welding.

Soviet experts systematically imparted advanced experience, gradually replacing old technologies with new ones, greatly shortening the time for shipbuilding and ship repair. For example, the old shipbuilding method was to first lay the keel and bottom plate on the slipway, then put on the ribs, cover the side plates, cover the decks on each floor, and finally carry out the superstructure of the central building. In this way, the subsequent projects could not be started until the previous project was completed, so the shipbuilding progress was slow. The long time that new ships occupy the slipway is extremely unfavorable for batch shipbuilding. The segmented tire-shaped shipbuilding method now used is to divide a ship into more than a dozen sections for separate manufacture, which greatly speeds up the progress. After adding welding machines, Soviet experts taught workers to use welding instead of riveting, which resulted in saving 20 percent of steel plates and rivets, reducing the weight and resistance of the ship, and accelerating the speed of the ship. In terms of ship repair, Soviet experts taught us to use the parallel flow operation method, so that workers of various different types can widely carry out work on the ship without interfering with each other, thus speeding up ship repair.

The Chinese Communist Party Committee of the Sino-Soviet Joint-Stock Shipbuilding and Ship Repair Company pays great attention to improving the management and technical level of the vast number of employees, and organizes and leads employees to learn from Soviet experts. Soviet experts regard improving the management and technical level of Chinese employees as a glorious task. In order to teach workers to master a skill, they often explain it repeatedly and personally demonstrate it. After several years of efforts, the technical level of workers has gradually improved. In 1946, workers could only repair steam engine ships. Soon after, they learned to repair internal combustion engine ships. Since last year, they have begun to repair turbine engine ships, including cargo ships and ocean-going passenger ships with a displacement of more than 10,000 tons. When the shipyard was established in 1948, it could only manufacture 100-ton cargo ships and 150-horsepower diesel engine tugboats. Now, it can manufacture 1,200-horsepower ocean-going diesel engine tugboats and 3,700-ton large barges for transporting high-grade petroleum. The quality can meet the Soviet design requirements.

Soviet experts also systematically imparted the experience of socialist enterprise management. For example, the organizational structure within the enterprise, the valuation work which is particularly important for ship repair and shipbuilding enterprises, was done from the beginning in accordance with the principles of socialist management, and was continuously improved according to the changes in the situation, which created conditions for the entire company to organize production rhythmically and economically. Soviet experts have persistently promoted the piece-rate wage system, which unifies the personal interests of employees with the interests of the state. Up to now, 91.7 percent of employees have implemented the piece-rate wage system (96 percent if calculated by production workers). The implementation of the piece-rate wage system, coupled with the education of the Party and the trade union, has improved the enthusiasm and responsibility of workers in managing production. Employees can actively propose ways to overcome production interruptions caused by technical organization. The vast number of employees actively urge and cooperate with the leadership to improve unreasonable labor organization. For example, the original production groups in the forging shop, electrical shop, hull shop, and wood shop were too large and easily led to idling. Now that the groups have been reduced in size, they encourage each other and everyone works, which has promoted the universal improvement of labor productivity. For example, in the past, forging crankshafts in the forging factory required 1,080 hours for a group of 27 people. After changing to a cyclical operation of 7 people, it only took 200 hours. Now, 54 types of work have transitioned from experience-based estimates to average advanced quotas with operational content and measurement basis. These quotas have become the scientific basis for enterprise planning.

While continuously strengthening enterprise management and learning advanced experience, the Sino-Soviet Joint-Stock Shipbuilding and Ship Repair Company has, since last year, also launched indicator-based labor competitions with the help of Soviet experts, which has ensured the continuous improvement of labor efficiency. For example, if the man-hour quota for manufacturing the first 1,200-horsepower ocean-going tugboat in 1953 is 100, then it is only 88.4 for manufacturing the fourth, and only 70.3 for manufacturing the seventh this year.

The excellent qualities of Soviet experts are even more examples for us to learn from. Let’s take Comrade Yudin, the director of the machine shop, as an example. He often urges others to rest, but when his own work is finished, he gives technical lessons to the employees. He is particularly concerned about the safety and health of the workers. One month, the number of personal accidents in the factory increased compared with the previous month. He stipulated that whenever an accident occurs, the section chief must personally lead the injured person to him to sign the certificate. When signing, he would inquire in detail about the cause of the injury, analyze the cause, immediately investigate the responsibility, and take measures. He often educates workers to pay attention to safety and tells them to wear labor protection tools. He said: "You are the masters now, and the country relies on you to complete socialist construction. If you don't take care of yourselves and get hurt, not only will you suffer, but the tasks that the country requires you to complete will also be delayed."

Soviet experts believe that it is unforgivable to fail to complete the state plan. They often say to Chinese comrades: Anyone who fails to complete the task on time can find more than a hundred reasons to defend themselves. Although there are many reasons, they can never cover up the fact that the plan has not been completed on time, and they can never make up for the lost time. The country and the people entrust us to complete the task, which means that we must try our best to overcome the difficulties in completing the task. Although some difficulties require the help of the higher authorities, we are still the initiators of solving the difficulties; therefore, no difficulty can excuse the error of failing to complete the plan!

    发展我国造船工业的强大力量
    连章
    标志着中苏两国之间伟大友谊的新发展的中苏会谈公报，受到大连中苏建造和修理轮船股份公司全体职工的衷心拥护。全体中国职工都决心在苏联的股份移交我国之前，系统地总结苏联专家传授的各种先进经验，以便进一步掌握苏联的先进技术和企业管理方法。
    在苏联真诚援助下，大连中苏建造和修理轮船股份公司已成为发展我国造船工业的强大力量。
    大连中苏建造和修理轮船股份公司的前身是大连船渠工厂，一八九八年到一九○四年为帝俄中东铁路系统的一个企业，日俄战争后为日本所据有。一九四五年苏军解放旅大后，由苏联接管。中华人民共和国成立后，苏联政府立即无偿地交给我国。当时，我国面临着恢复国民经济的艰巨任务，资金、设备和人力都很缺乏，因而向苏联政府提出中苏合营的要求，苏联政府接受了我国政府的要求，在大连船渠工厂的基础上，按平权合股原则，创办中苏建造和修理轮船股份公司。几年来，苏联政府派来上百名专家，运来大批机器，新建和扩建了很多厂房，培养出一批初步学会管理现代企业的干部。工厂面貌已为之一新。在以前，除船坞、船台、机械厂、锅炉厂、木工厂和动力厂等几个部门比较完整外，其它许多厂房都是搭的临时小屋，大部分工人都在露天工作。厂内道路很少，路基和路面很差，每遇雨天，泥泞不堪。现在，生产、辅助、准备等部门已作了通盘的调整。早在一九四八年的时候，就成立了独立的造船部门。从一九五○年起，陆续新建造船厂房和改建别的许多厂房，增加了生产面积百分之七十一。增加了新的设备，开辟了码头、公路和铁路，现代的运输工具可以进入一些厂房内。在机械加工厂里，苏联新式机床占百分之七十三，许多以前不能制造的零件现在能制造了，加工的精密度提高了，修船、造船工作中人工操作的比重大大减少了。在焊接和切割方面，增添了自动的和半自动的电焊机，节省了大量的劳动力，并保证了电焊质量。
    苏联专家系统地传授先进经验，逐渐以新的技术代替旧的技术，大大缩短了造船和修船的时间。例如旧的造船法是在造船台上先铺上龙骨和底板，再放上肋骨，覆上舷板，盖上各层甲板，最后才进行中央楼等上层建筑。这样前一段工程没完成，以后的工程便不能开始，所以造船进度缓慢。新船占用造船台的时间长，这对于成批造船极为不利。现在运用的分段胎型造船法，就是把一只船分成十几段分别制造，大大加速了进度。新添了电焊机后，苏联专家又教会工人以电焊代替铆接焊，结果节约了百分之二十的钢板和铆钉，减轻了船的体重和阻力，加速了船的航行速度。在修船方面，苏联专家教我们运用平行流水作业法，使各种不同工种的工人在船上广泛地开展工作面，而不致于互相妨碍，因而加快了修船速度。
    中共中苏建造和修理轮船股份公司委员会非常注意提高广大职工的管理水平和技术水平，组织和领导职工向苏联专家学习。苏联专家把提高中国职工的管理水平和技术水平作为光荣的任务。他们为了教会工人掌握一种技术，常常反复地讲解，亲自操作示范。经过几年来的努力，工人的技术水平已逐步提高。一九四六年的时候，工人只能修理蒸气机船只，以后不久就学会修理内燃机船只，从去年起，又开始修理透平机船只，其中有货船，也有排水量一万吨以上的远洋客船。一九四八年成立造船厂时，只能制造一百吨货船和一百五十匹马力的柴油机拖船，而现在，已经能制造一千二百匹马力的远洋柴油机拖船和三千七百吨的载运高级石油的大型驳船，质量都能达到苏联设计要求。
    苏联专家也系统地传授了社会主义企业的经营管理经验。例如企业内部的组织机构，对修船、造船企业特别重要的估价工作，从开头就按照社会主义的管理原则来做，以后又按照情况的变化而给予不断的改进，这就给整个公司有节奏地、节约地组织生产创造了条件。苏联专家对把职工的个人利益同国家利益统一起来的计件工资制度，曾坚持不懈地予以推行。到现在为止，已有百分之九十一点七的职工实行计件工资（若以生产工人计，则有百分之九十六）。实行了计件工资，加上党和工会的教育，提高了工人管理生产的积极性和责任心。职工对于因技术组织上造成的生产中断，都能够主动地提出克服的办法。广大的职工都积极地督促和配合领导改善不合理的劳动组织。例如锻工一厂、电气厂、船体厂和木工厂原来的生产小组过大，容易窝工。现在小组改小了，互相鼓励，人人干活，促使了劳动生产率的普遍提高。如锻工厂过去锻造拐轴，二十七人一小组需要一千零八十小时，改为七人的循环作业后，只用二百小时。现在，已有五十四种工种由经验估计的定额，过渡到有操作内容和测定根据的平均先进定额。这些定额成为企业计划工作的科学基础。
    中苏建造和修理轮船股份公司在不断地加强企业的管理和学习先进经验的同时，从去年起，又在苏联专家的帮助下，开展了有指标的劳动竞赛，这就保证了劳动效率的不断提高。例如，以一九五三年制造第一艘一千二百匹马力远洋拖船的工时定额为一百，则制造第四艘时只有八十八点四，今年制造第七艘时只有七十点三。
    苏联专家的优良品质更是我们学习的榜样。举机械厂厂长尤金同志做例子吧。他经常督促别人休息，但他自己的工作完了，却又给职工讲技术课。他特别关心工人的安全和健康。有一个月工厂的人身事故比上月增加了，他就规定凡发生事故，工段长必须亲自领着受伤的人到他那里去签证明书。在签字的时候，他就详细地询问受伤的经过，分析原因，立即追查责任，采取措施。他经常教育工人注意安全，嘱咐一定要戴上劳动保护工具。他说：“你们当主人了，国家就依靠你们来完成社会主义的建设，假如你们不爱护自己，受了伤，不仅是自己受苦，而且国家要求你们完成的任务也给耽误了。”
    苏联专家认为完不成国家计划是不可原谅的。他们常跟中国同志说：任何一个没有按期完成任务的人，都能找出一百个以上的理由来为自己辩护，理由虽多，但永远掩盖不了没有按期完成计划的事实，也永远没法弥补已失去了的时间；国家和人民委托我们来完成任务，就是要我们想尽一切办法来克服完成任务中的困难，虽然有些困难需要请上级给予帮助，但解决困难的主动者还是我们自己；所以，任何困难，都不能原谅没有完成计划的错误！（附图片）
