To the Editor:

Since the establishment of the Beijing Food Company, it has done a lot of work in ensuring the supply of non-staple foods and stabilizing the non-staple food market. However, they have done very poorly in hygiene and sanitation and this urgently needs to be improved.

The meat supply department of the Food Company has very poor livestock raising conditions: the pigpens are few and dirty, the stench of manure and urine fills the air, and they become muddy during the rainy season, which seriously affects the health of the piglets; the feeding of livestock is chaotic, and some cattle do not get enough to eat... The consequences of this situation are weight loss, injury, and even death of livestock. The meat supply department also does not properly store the initially processed meat. In early July, a batch of fresh pork spoiled and deteriorated due to poor storage conditions. The aquatic products department also has many problems. Fresh fish often rots before it reaches retail outlets due to poor packaging and insufficient ice; the hygiene of the warehouse where salted fish is stored is poor, and many salted fish become infested with parasites in the summer; when selling crabs, there is a constant high rate of mortality. The courtyard of the fruit department is messy, and the fruit piled outdoors in summer and autumn attracts many flies, and much of the fruit rots. The egg products department does not have a fixed location. Currently, eggs are stored in a fruit warehouse, which has high humidity and no sanitary equipment, making the eggs prone to spoilage. In addition, the inspection work is flawed, with bad eggs mixed with good eggs, resulting in instances of selling rotten eggs to citizens. Broken eggs during transportation are also mixed with unclean debris such as grass.

The above situation shows that due to the poor hygiene work of the units under the Food Company, not only has a lot of food been lost, wasting state resources, but more seriously, some spoiled food has been sold to citizens due to lax inspection, which may cause serious harm to people's health.

It should be pointed out that similar situations also exist in other food enterprises in Beijing. For example, the sanitation in the slaughterhouses under the Beijing Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce is very poor: pigs are not properly cleaned of hair, raw meat is contaminated with feces, entrails and meat are scattered on the ground, and meat inspection is not thorough... The production workshops of the joint state-private Yili Food Company are also very dirty.

It must be admitted that due to the improvement of people's living standards and the requirements of the objective situation, the business of food enterprises is expanding, and equipment conditions cannot keep up with current needs; moreover, food is different from other commodities, and the transportation, storage, and sales are more complicated. There are many difficulties in operation, and we lack experience. These are all objective facts. However, it must be pointed out that the main reason for the poor hygiene situation in food enterprises is that leading cadres do not pay enough attention to hygiene work, and even separate hygiene work from food business operations. They have not fully realized that food is a special commodity, and doing a good job in food hygiene is a major issue related to the health of the people, and has special and important significance for food enterprises. If leading cadres truly attach importance to hygiene work ideologically, then the food hygiene situation can be greatly improved. At present, the general staff of food enterprises lack the necessary hygiene knowledge, which also affects the development of hygiene work, and deserves serious attention from the leadership.

Improving the hygiene situation of food enterprises is an urgent task and a pressing demand of the vast majority of people in the city. It is hoped that the Beijing Municipal People's Government will urge relevant leading organs to take prompt and effective measures to solve this problem.

### 北京市食品公司的卫生工作做得不好

    北京市食品公司的卫生工作做得不好编辑同志：
    北京市食品公司成立以来，在保证副食品的供应和稳定副食品的市场等方面，做了不少工作。但是，他们在卫生工作方面却做得很差，亟待改善。
    食品公司肉食供应部对牲畜的饲养情况很不好：猪圈既少且脏，粪尿臭气四溢，一到雨季更是泥泞不堪，严重地影响猪仔的健康；牲口喂草料的情况很乱，有些牛就吃不饱……。这种情况所造成的后果，就是牲畜减秤、病伤、甚至死亡。肉食供应部对已经初步加工的肉类保管得也不够好，在七月上旬就曾发生一批新鲜猪肉因保管条件不好而腐败变质的事件。水产部的问题也不少。由于包装不良、装冰不够，运往零售部门的鲜鱼经常腐坏；放置腌鱼的仓库卫生情况很差，在夏季有不少腌鱼生了寄生虫；在经营螃蟹时，也不断有大量的死亡。水果部院内零乱，在夏秋两季露天堆放的水果招引了很多苍蝇，果物腐烂的也很多。蛋品部没有固定的场所，目前蛋品储存在水果仓库中，湿度很大，并且毫无卫生设备，蛋品很容易变坏，再加上检验工作有缺点，坏鸡蛋和好鸡蛋混在一起，因而曾经发生了把臭鸡蛋卖给市民的现象。在一些因运输途中破碎而打开的鸡蛋中，还混有草棍等不洁杂物。
    以上情况说明：由于食品公司所属单位卫生工作做得不好，不但使很多食品遭受了损失，浪费了国家的物资；而更严重的是，有些腐坏的食物还因检验不严而卖给市民，可能引起损害人民健康的严重恶果。
    应该指出，类似情况在北京市其他食品企业中也是存在的。像北京市工商管理局所属的屠宰场，场内卫生情况就十分糟糕：屠猪去毛不净，生肉污染粪便，内脏肉体随地乱放，肉品检验工作不彻底……。公私合营的义利食品公司的生产车间也很脏。
    应该承认，由于人民生活水平的提高和客观形势的要求，食品企业的业务日益扩大，设备条件就赶不上目前的需要；而且食品不同于其他商品，在运输、保管、销售各方面情况比较复杂，经营中困难较多，我们又缺乏经验。这些都是客观存在的事实。但是，必须指出：目前食品企业中卫生情况之所以不好，主要原因还是领导干部对卫生工作不够重视，甚至把卫生工作和食品经营工作割裂起来。他们没有充分地认识到食品是一种特殊的商品，搞好食品卫生是关系人民健康的大事，对食品企业有着特殊重要的意义；领导干部如果在思想上真正重视卫生工作，那末食品卫生情况是可以大大改善的。目前，食品企业的一般工作人员缺乏必要的卫生知识，也影响着卫生工作的开展，值得领导方面严重注意。
    改善食品企业的卫生情况是一件刻不容缓的工作，是全市广大人民的迫切要求，希望北京市人民政府督促有关领导机关采取迅速有效的措施解决这个问题。　凌冬
