Comrade Chairman, dear comrades and friends:

    Today, the free Albanian people are celebrating the tenth anniversary of their liberation from the shackles of fascism and feudal and bourgeois oppression with a series of achievements at home.

    The historic victory of November 29, 1944, is the culmination of the long-term efforts and struggles of the Albanian people for land, freedom, and independence.

    In the long historical process, our small country has continuously fought and shed blood to crush the shackles of slavery imposed on us by insatiable imperialists. Our people have suffered and been oppressed by all kinds of invaders, who have drowned our people's revolution in blood. To satisfy their greed, they have used our people as currency for exchange, treating our country as a commodity to be bought and sold, but all in vain. Faced with so much misfortune and suffering, our people have never succumbed, despite countless conspiracies and threats. They have taken up arms and opened up the path of history. In the course of their struggle without assistance, our people saw the dawn of their liberation in the victory of the great October Revolution, which created a new era in human history.

    Our people realized that from then on, they had to fight bravely to win. Our vast poor peasants and workers suffering in misery understood this even more clearly. The great October Revolution educated our working people, preparing them for the struggle against feudalism, imperialism, exploitation, and long-term oppression.

    The occupation of Albania by Italian fascists on April 7, 1939, made it urgently necessary for Albania to carry out an organized armed liberation struggle and to establish a Marxist-Leninist party loyal to the interests of the people. After Nazi Germany launched its shameless invasion, the Soviet Union's entry into the war gave the Albanian people a clear vision of defeating the enemy. The development of the communist movement led to the founding of the Albanian Communist Party on November 8, 1941. The founding of the Party marked a decisive step in the Albanian people's anti-fascist revolutionary movement, which was organized to permanently rid themselves of the fascist occupiers and feudal bourgeois forces that exploited the working class and poor peasants by sucking their blood and sweat.

    In a struggle where the strength was vastly unequal, the Albanian people faced a very ferocious enemy, but they finally won because they fought selflessly under the leadership of the Communist Party (now the Albanian Labor Party); because the path they took was correct, firm, and uncompromising. The Albanian people owe their freedom to the Soviet Union, to the glorious Soviet army that destroyed Hitler's German war machine. The entry of the Soviet army into the Balkans forced the Nazi army to retreat and enabled our People's Liberation Army to expel the Nazi bandits from Albanian territory.

    Ten years of liberation is a short period in the history of a nation, but it has brought about astonishing progress in all aspects of Albanian life.

    Today, on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of liberation, the Albanian people are victoriously struggling to complete the tasks of the fourth year of the country's first Five-Year Plan. The main purpose of this plan is to transform Albania from a backward agricultural country into a country with developed agriculture and industry.

    Achievements in industry are the greatest achievements of the Albanian people in the last decade. Yesterday's Albania was only a country with a few small factories and mines, most of which were the property of capitalists; but today we see a young and newborn industry with modern machines and equipment, all owned by the people. The state has built many new enterprises, such as the Stalin Textile Factory, the "November 8th" Sugar Factory, the Lenin Hydroelectric Power Station, the Enver Hoxha Machine Factory, many cotton ginning and rice mills, the Nako Spiru Combined Timber Factory, many cigarette factories, and other factories. By the end of this year, the total industrial output will be 11.4 times that of the pre-war period; mineral production will be 5.6 times; oil production will be 4.3 times; food industry production will be 7.5 times; clothing industry production will be 33.7 times; and electrical industry production will be 19 times. In addition, our industry will add many new factories, such as the Enver Hoxha Central Hydroelectric Power Station, an oil refinery, a cement factory, and other factories.

    Agriculture has also made significant achievements. Compared with 1938, the sown area increased to 169.7 percent in 1954. The land that was cultivated using primitive methods in the past is now mostly using agricultural machinery. As a result, the yield of grains and technical crops has also increased.

    A major achievement in agriculture is the presence of socialist components. The socialist components are manifested in the participation of working farmers in agricultural cooperatives to jointly manage agriculture and animal husbandry. These agricultural cooperatives have served as a model for individual farmers.

    Significant achievements have also been made in other areas of the national economy. Many new highways have been opened, and railways have been built for the first time.

    At the time of liberation, more than 80 percent of the population was illiterate; today, this long-term pain is gradually being eliminated. The doors of schools are opening wide to the children of the people. In 1938, Albania had 643 primary schools with 52,000 students, and 11 secondary schools with 6,300 students; while in the 1954-1955 academic year, our country had 2,140 primary schools with 136,800 students, and 343 ten-year schools and seven-year schools with 48,300 students. For the first time in Albanian history, six institutions of higher learning have been established. Our culture is a culture with socialist content in national form, and its development has become the main factor in educating the broad working people and cultivating new people for socialist society.

    Although the remarkable and huge achievements made in the past ten years have improved the material life of the broad working people, the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party and the Government of the People's Republic of Albania have recently made important decisions regarding the future development of the national economy.

    According to these decisions, the production of daily consumer goods will be increased several times to better meet the needs of the broad working people. For example, in 1955, each person will receive more than in 1953: 32 percent more sugar, 14 percent more soap, 22 percent more cotton cloth, 350 percent more wool, 53 percent more shoes, 47 percent more furniture, and so on. On the eve of the tenth anniversary of liberation, the government conducted its third price reduction on consumer and industrial goods in five years, saving the broad working people 300 million leks.

    The great and eternal friendship between the Albanian people and the Soviet Union is one of the main factors for the various victories achieved by the Albanian people, including those achieved internationally. Without the Soviet army, a free Albania would be unthinkable. Without the great assistance of the Soviet Union, our country would not be able to build socialism. The experience and culture of the Soviet Union have become indispensable factors for Albania in its struggle to develop its economy and culture. The friendship established with the Soviet Union has become the foundation of the Albanian people's patriotism, and this friendship is the Albanian people's ever-victorious weapon.

    In addition, the people's democratic countries have also given Albania great assistance and continuously supported Albania's economic and cultural development.

    These achievements of the Albanian people have been achieved in the past ten years through fierce struggles against enemies both at home and abroad. These enemies have constantly sought to overthrow the people's regime and restore dark and oppressive rule. The American imperialists have relentlessly taken hostile actions against the People's Republic of Albania. They have tried their best to intimidate the Albanian people, attempting to make the Albanian people refuse to take the socialist road and to separate the Albanian people from the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp. However, all the plans of the imperialists have failed. The Albanian people have not been intimidated because the Albanian Labor Party and the Government of the People's Republic of Albania have implemented a firm policy to defend the freedom, independence, and territorial integrity of the People's Republic of Albania, and because the Soviet Union, great China, and the socialist and peaceful camp stand with it and invariably protect it.

    The Albanian people's mobilization of all their strength to build a socialist motherland also contributes to the great struggle to defend peace. They love peace and are determined to defend it at all costs. Because without lasting peace, without a society based on mutual respect for sovereignty and the desire for genuine cooperation among all nations, it is impossible to build socialism that gives people happiness and prosperity.

    To express the Albanian people's will and determination to coexist peacefully with all countries, the Government of the People's Republic of Albania has warmly accepted the Soviet proposal to convene an all-European conference to discuss the establishment of a European collective security system. The Government of the People's Republic of Albania has stated that it is not only willing to participate in this conference, but will also work with other peaceful and democratic countries to ensure that the conference achieves satisfactory results, prevents the revival of German militarism, and eases international tensions.

    It was only after the brilliant victory of the Chinese People's Revolution that our two geographically distant countries were able to become so close, forming a sincere, warm, and unshakable friendship. The victory of the Chinese People's Revolution was made possible by the long and heroic struggle of the Chinese people, by the existence of the Soviet Union, and by the Soviet army's historic victory over German Nazis and Japanese militarism.

    The Albanian people have a deep friendship with the Chinese people. They admire the efforts and continuous struggles of this great people, and they admire the Chinese people's patriotism and determination to fight for freedom and national independence. When the revolutionary forces of the Chinese people continuously attacked the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and their American masters, when the Chinese revolution moved from one victory to another, the Albanian people were overjoyed and firmly believed that the just cause of the people of the great Chinese brotherly country would be victorious.

    The revolutionary victory achieved against foreign imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism is the culmination of the Chinese people's struggle for freedom and national independence for more than a century. It is a historic victory of great international significance, which further strengthens the strength of the socialist and peaceful camp.

    The Albanian people would like to congratulate the Chinese people for the tremendous achievements made under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Government of the People's Republic of China, headed by Chairman Mao Zedong, the beloved son and great leader of the Chinese people, in the short period of the country's transition to socialism.

    The Albanian people's voice is consistent with the voices of millions of people in supporting the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China on the international stage. They believe that the People's Republic of China is one of the great powers, and that no major international issue can be resolved without China's active participation. The Albanian people support the Chinese people's legitimate right to liberate Taiwan, because the American imperialists are using Taiwan as a means of provocation against the People's Republic of China and the people of Asia.

    The recently concluded cultural and scientific-technical agreement between the Government of the People's Republic of Albania and the Government of the People's Republic of China has further strengthened the friendship between our two countries and the cooperation between our two peoples based on the principle of mutual respect. Our two peoples are advancing on a common and glorious path, joining hands in building socialism, and becoming steadfast comrades-in-arms in defending peace, democracy, and socialism.

    Our people are proud to have such great and sincere friends as the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. We will cherish this friendship as we cherish the apple of our eye, and we will continuously strengthen this friendship.

    Long live the great and unbreakable friendship between the Albanian people and the Chinese people!

    Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the outstanding son and great leader of the Chinese people!

    Long live the great unity of the forces of peace, democracy, and socialism led by the Soviet Union!

    Long live world peace!

### 阿尔巴尼亚大使纳赛的讲话

1954-11-29

专栏：

    阿尔巴尼亚大使纳赛的讲话主席同志、亲爱的同志们和朋友们：
    自由的阿尔巴尼亚人民今天在国内正以一系列的成就来庆祝本国从法西斯的枷锁、封建和资产阶级压迫之下获得解放的十周年纪念日。
    一九四四年十一月二十九日的历史性的胜利，是阿尔巴尼亚人民为争取土地、自由和独立而进行的长时期的努力和斗争的成就。
    在悠久的历史过程当中，我们这个人口不多的国家为粉碎贪得无厌的帝国主义者加在我们身上的奴役枷锁曾不停地进行了斗争并付出自己的鲜血。我们的人民曾遭受到苦难以及各色各样的侵略者的压迫，这些侵略者把我国人民革命淹没在血泊中，为满足他们的贪欲曾将我国人民当做货币来交换，将我国当作商品，彼此买卖，但都归徒劳。我国人民面临这样多的不幸和苦难，尽管遭遇着无数的阴谋和威胁，却从来不曾屈服过，他们拿起了武器开辟了历史的道路。在毫无援助的斗争过程当中，我国人民在伟大的十月革命的胜利中看到了解放自己的曙光，这一革命在人类历史上创造了新的纪元。
    我国人民认识到从此以后必须英勇地战斗，才能获得胜利。我国广大的贫苦农民们和在苦难中受罪的工人们对这认识得更清楚。伟大的十月革命教育了我国劳动人民，使他们对于反抗封建主义、帝国主义、剥削及长时期压迫的斗争有了准备。
    一九三九年四月七日，意大利法西斯的占领阿尔巴尼亚，使阿尔巴尼亚感到迫切需要进行有组织的武装的解放斗争，以及创立马克思列宁主义的、忠于人民利益的党。在纳粹德寇发动无耻侵略之后，苏联的参战给阿尔巴尼亚人民展开了战胜敌人的明确的远景。共产主义运动的发展，促成了阿尔巴尼共产党在一九四一年十一月八日的成立。在阿尔巴尼亚人民为永远摆脱那些以剥削工人阶级和贫苦农民为目的而吸取他们血汗的法西斯占领者、封建资产阶级的势力而组织的反法西斯的革命运动中，党的成立标帜着有决定性的一个步骤。
    在实力悬殊的斗争中，阿尔巴尼亚人民面对着的是十分凶恶的敌人，但他们终于获得了胜利，因为他们曾在共产党（即今天的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党）的领导下奋不顾身地战斗着；因为他们所走的道路是正确的、坚决的、不妥协的道路。阿尔巴尼亚人民得到自由，应感谢苏联，感谢摧毁希特勒德国战争机器的光荣的苏联军队。苏联军队的进入巴尔干，迫使纳粹军队败退，并使得我国人民解放军能够从阿尔巴尼亚国土上驱逐纳粹匪帮。
    解放已有十年，这在一国人民的历史上是一个短短的时期，但在阿尔巴尼亚人民生活各方面都产生了惊人的进步。
    今天，正值解放十周年，阿尔巴尼亚人民为完成国家第一个五年计划第四年的任务正胜利地斗争着。这个计划主要的目的是将阿尔巴尼亚从落后的农业国变为拥有发达的农业和工业的国家。
    工业方面的成就是十年来阿尔巴尼亚人民的最大成就。昨天的阿尔巴尼亚还只是一个有几座小工厂、几个矿山的国家，而且这些工厂矿山大都是资本家的财产；但今天我们所看到的，是具有现代机器和设备、为人民所有的年轻新生工业。国家建设了许多新的企业，如斯大林纺织工厂，“十一月八日”制糖厂，列宁水电站，恩维尔·霍查机器厂，许多轧棉厂和制米厂，纳科·斯皮鲁联合木材厂，许多制烟厂和其他工厂。今年年底工业总产量将为战前的十一·四倍； 矿物产量五·六倍；石油产量四·三倍；食品工业产量七·五倍；服装工业产量三三·七倍；电气工业产量十九倍。除此以外，我们的工业还要增加许多新的工厂，如恩维尔·霍查中央水电厂，石油提炼厂，洋灰厂以及其他工厂。
    农业同样也有了显著的成绩。和一九三八年相比，播种面积在一九五四年增加为百分之一六九·七。过去用原始方法耕种的土地，现在绝大部分已使用农业机器。因此谷物的产量和技术作物的产量也有了增加。
    农业方面取得的重大成就是在于有了社会主义成份。社会主义成份表现在劳动农民参加农业合作社共同经营农业及畜牧业上。这些农业合作社对单干户已起了示范作用。
    在国民经济其他方面也有了重大的成就。新开了不少的公路，第一次修筑了铁路。
    刚解放时，全国百分之八十以上的人口是文盲；今天这长时期的痛苦已正在逐渐消除。学校的大门对人民的子女正大大地开着。一九三八年阿尔巴尼亚六百四十三个初级学校计有五万二千个学生，十一个中等学校有六千三百个学生；而在一九五四—一九五五年这一学年内，我国初级学校有二千一百四十个，学生十三万六千八百人，十年制学校及七年制的学校三百四十三个，学生四万八千三百人。在阿尔巴尼亚历史中，第一次开办了六个高等专科学校。我们的文化是民族形式社会主义内容的文化，这种文化的发展已成为教育广大劳动人民、培养社会主义社会新人物的主要因素。
    十年来所取得的显著的巨大成绩虽然已提高了广大劳动人民的物质生活，但阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会和阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府最近又作了关于全国经济今后发展的重要决定。
    按照这些决定，日用消费品的产量将提高数倍，以更好地满足广大劳动人民的需要。例如一九五五年每人将比一九五三年多得：糖百分之三十二，肥皂百分之十四，棉布百分之二十二，呢绒百分之三百五十，鞋百分之五十三，家具百分之四十七等等。解放十周年纪念日的前夕，政府进行了五年以来的第三次降低消费品和工业品的价格，这给广大劳动人民节省了三亿里克。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民和苏联的伟大和永恒的友谊是阿尔巴尼亚人民取得各种胜利，包括在国际方面取得的胜利的主要因素之一。没有苏联军队，就不能设想自由的阿尔巴尼亚。没有苏联的伟大援助，我国就不能建设社会主义。苏联的经验和文化已成为阿尔巴尼亚在发展经济和文化斗争中不可缺少的因素。与苏联建立的友谊已成为阿尔巴尼亚人民爱国主义的基础，这友谊是阿尔巴尼亚人民常胜的武器。
    此外，各人民民主国家也给了阿尔巴尼亚莫大的援助，对阿尔巴尼亚经济和文化的发展不间断地加以支持。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民的这些成绩是在十年来同内外敌人进行激烈斗争中取得的。这些敌人时时刻刻地想推翻人民政权并恢复黑暗和压迫的统治。美帝国主义者毫不放松地对阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国采取敌对行动，他们竭力恐吓阿尔巴尼亚人民，企图使阿尔巴尼亚人民拒绝走社会主义的道路，企图使阿尔巴尼亚人民脱离苏联及整个社会主义阵营。但是，帝国主义者的一切计划都遭到失败，阿尔巴尼亚人民未被吓倒，因为阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府执行了坚决的政策来保卫阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国的自由、独立和领土完整，因为苏联、伟大的中国和社会主义的和平的阵营都和它站在一起，并始终不变地保护它。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民为建设社会主义祖国而动员一切力量，这也是有助于保卫和平的伟大斗争的。他们热爱和平并决心不惜一切来保卫和平。因为没有持久的和平，没有以互相尊重主权、各民族真诚合作的愿望为基础的社会，就不可能建设给予人民幸福和繁荣生活的社会主义。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府为表达阿尔巴尼亚人民同各国人民和平共处的意志和决心，曾热烈地接受了苏联所提出的关于召开全欧会议，商讨建立欧洲集体安全体系的建议。阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府声明，不仅愿意参与此次会议，并将同其他和平民主国家共同努力使会议获得圆满结果，阻止德国军国主义的复活，缓和国际局势的紧张。
  只是在中国人民革命取得辉煌胜利后，我们这两个相距遥远的国家才能够如此亲近，结成真诚热烈而不可动摇的友谊。中国人民革命的胜利是由于中国人民经过了长期的英勇斗争，由于苏联的存在，由于苏联军队对德国纳粹分子和日本军国主义取得了历史性的胜利，才成为可能的。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民对中国人民具有深厚的友谊，他们赞美这一伟大人民的努力和不断的斗争，赞美中国人民的爱国主义和争取自由和民族独立的决心。当中国人民的革命力量连续不断地打击着蒋介石卖国集团及其美国主子时，当中国革命从一个胜利走到另一个胜利时，阿尔巴尼亚人民欣喜万分，并深信伟大中国兄弟国家的人民的正义事业一定会取得胜利。
    为反对外国帝国主义和官僚资本主义所取得的革命胜利，是中国人民为争取自由和民族独立而进行的百余年斗争的成就。它是具有重要国际意义的历史性的胜利，它进一步加强了社会主义和平阵营的力量。
    以中国人民的亲爱儿子和伟大的领袖毛泽东主席为首的中国共产党和中华人民共和国政府领导中国人民在国家向社会主义过渡的短短时期内取得了巨大的成就，阿尔巴尼亚人民谨表示祝贺。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民的呼声和千百万人民的呼声一致支持中华人民共和国在国际舞台上的合法权利。他们相信：中华人民共和国是强国之一，国际间每个重大问题如果没有中国的积极参加，是不可能得到解决的。阿尔巴尼亚人民支持中国人民解放台湾的合法权利，因为美国帝国主义者将利用台湾作为一种对中华人民共和国及亚洲人民的挑衅手段。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府和中华人民共和国政府新近缔结的文化及科学技术协定，进一步加强了我们两国间的友谊和基于互相尊重原则的两国人民间的合作。我们两国人民在共同的光荣的道路上前进，在建设社会主义的道路上携手，成为保卫和平、民主和社会主义的坚决战友。
    我们的人民以能有苏联和中华人民共和国这样伟大而真挚的朋友而感到骄傲。我们将像爱护自己眼珠似地珍爱这个友谊，并且不停地加强这个友谊。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民和中国人民的伟大的和牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    中国人民优秀的儿子、伟大的领袖毛泽东主席万岁！
    以苏联为首的和平、民主、社会主义的力量大团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
