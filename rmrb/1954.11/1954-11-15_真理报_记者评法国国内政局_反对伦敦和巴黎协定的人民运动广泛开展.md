    "Pravda" Reporter Comments on the French Domestic Political Situation
    Popular Movement Against the London and Paris Agreements Widely Developing
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 13th] TASS Moscow, 12th: "Pravda" correspondent in Paris, Lasakin, comments on the French domestic political situation on the eve of the French National Assembly's debate on the London and Paris Agreements.

    He writes: Certain French politicians are trying hard to persuade all sectors of society to allow the revival of the German "Bundeswehr," insisting that the establishment of the "Bundeswehr" is "inevitable" because this is what the US ruling clique demands. However, no Frenchman has forgotten that France once rejected the "European Army" plan despite threats and pressure from the United States, proving that France is capable of pursuing an independent national policy.

    Lasakin continued: Among parliamentarians and people from various parties, there is a growing sentiment against the current direction of French foreign policy. Sober voices can often be heard from leading figures in the Socialist Party and the Gaullist Party. The popular movement against the London and Paris Agreements is also developing more and more widely. According to the materials of the French National Peace Council, in a short period of time, more than one million people in France have already signed petitions against the London and Paris Agreements. Workers, peasants, artisans, small business owners, scientists, cultural workers, artists, and students all oppose the new plans to rearm German revanchists. More and more French Socialist Party members, Communist Party members, and non-party members are taking joint action against the reconstruction of the "Bundeswehr." Nine leaders of the Socialist Party's Seine Department Committee, in view of the indignation of ordinary Socialist Party members, specifically issued an appeal against West German remilitarization.

    Lasakin said: The fact that an increasingly broad base of ordinary Socialist Party members are participating in the movement against the revival of the "Bundeswehr" is of particular importance, because the Mendes-France government is counting on the votes of Socialist Party parliamentarians to secure the approval of the London and Paris Agreements. The outcome of the upcoming parliamentary debates will largely depend on whether the Socialist Party leaders have to consider the will of ordinary Socialist Party members and the entire French people.

    “真理报”记者评法国国内政局
    反对伦敦和巴黎协定的人民运动广泛开展
    【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十二日讯：“真理报”驻巴黎记者拉萨金评论法国国民议会就伦敦协定和巴黎协定举行辩论前夕法国国内的政局。
    他写道：某些法国政客竭力要说服社会各界人士听任德国“国防军”复活，硬说“国防军”的建立是“不可避免的”，因为这是美国统治集团的要求。但是，任何一个法国人都没有忘记：法国曾经不顾美国的威胁和压迫，否决了“欧洲军”计划，这证明法国能够执行独立的民族政策。
    拉萨金接着说：在议会人士和各党派人士中，反对目前法国外交政策方针的情绪日益增长。从社会党和戴高乐党的领袖人物当中经常可以听到清醒的呼声。反对伦敦协定和巴黎协定的人民运动也日益广泛地开展着。据法国全国和平理事会的材料，在短短一个时期内，法国就已经有一百多万人签名反对伦敦协定和巴黎协定。科学、文化、艺术工作者，学生，工人，农民，手工业者和小商人都反对重新武装德国复仇主义者的新计划。愈来愈多的法国社会党员、共产党员和无党派人士正在采取共同行动反对重建“国防军”。社会党塞纳省委员会的九个领导人鉴于社会党普通党员的激愤，特别发表了一个反对西德重新军国主义化的呼吁书。
    拉萨金说：越来越广泛的社会党普通党员参加了反对复活“国防军”的运动，这个事实有特别重要的意义，因为孟戴斯—弗朗斯政府指望依靠社会党议员的投票来使伦敦协定和巴黎协定获得批准。未来议会的辩论结果如何，在很大程度上决定于社会党领袖们是否不得不考虑社会党普通党员和全体法国人民的意志。
