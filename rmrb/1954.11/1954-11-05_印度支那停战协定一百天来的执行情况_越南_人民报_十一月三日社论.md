Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 3rd Dispatch from Vietnam News Agency:

The Geneva Accords were signed over a hundred days ago, and the restoration of peace in Indochina is also approaching one hundred days.

In the steps of ceasefire, troop regrouping, troop transportation, exchange of prisoners of war, and demarcation of temporary military demarcation lines, despite the dispersed battle lines and complicated situations, and despite difficulties in communication, transportation, and traffic, the Vietnam People's Army, the Khmer Resistance Forces, and the Lao Fighting Forces have correctly and effectively implemented the terms of the Geneva Conference agreements.

In North Vietnam, the Vietnam People's Army has recovered towns in twelve provinces, including the capital Hanoi and Hai Duong City. Currently, the entire Red River Delta, except for the port of Haiphong and its surrounding area, has been liberated. Under the people's democratic regime, from rural areas to cities, the Vietnamese people are enthusiastically and actively rebuilding their war-torn country and are fighting to consolidate peace.

In South Vietnam, the Vietnam People's Army has completed the withdrawal from the Ca Mau-Ha Tien area and the Plain of Reeds, and has transferred two units from the Fifth Interzone of South Central Vietnam to North Vietnam. Despite the rainy season and harsh weather, the Vietnam People's Army has completed this task as scheduled and effectively moved its troops. This is due to the people's enthusiastic assistance to the army, the efforts and discipline of cadres and soldiers, and the sincere help of fraternal countries, especially the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union and Poland's sending of ships to assist in transporting troops and cadres from the south to the north is a great encouragement to the Vietnamese people.

In Cambodia, the fighters of the Khmer Resistance Forces have, in accordance with the Geneva Accords, completed their demobilization in place one month after the ceasefire. These fighters, who once fought heroically for independence, democracy, and peace, are now fighting to implement the ceasefire agreement and consolidate peace. They are returning to their hometowns to make a living and continue to strive for the consolidation of peace, the realization of unity and democracy, and the realization of the motherland's independence. By October 18, 1954, Vietnamese volunteers in Cambodia had completely withdrawn to Vietnam, two days ahead of the time stipulated by the Geneva Accords.

In Laos, Vietnamese volunteers will completely withdraw by November 20, 1954. All fighters of the Lao Fighting Forces will be concentrated in the two provinces of Phongsaly and Sam Neua. Although the battle lines are in mountainous areas, it is the rainy season, there is a lack of transportation, and the other side has created various difficulties, many units of the Lao Fighting Forces and Vietnamese volunteers have overcome all difficulties, traveled thousands of kilometers in the mountains and forests, and safely arrived in the assembly areas.

During the troop regrouping period, especially during the arduous troop transportation, the full assistance of the Cambodian and Lao peoples to the Resistance Forces and Vietnamese volunteers once again proved that the army and the people are united, and the peoples of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos are united.

In the hundred days of implementing the armistice agreement, although the enemies of peace – the US imperialists and colonialists – have been sabotaging the armistice agreement, and their servants have been distorting facts and spreading lies to slander us, facts have proved that the Vietnam People's Army, the Khmer Resistance Forces, and the Lao Fighting Forces are resolutely and seriously implementing the agreed-upon terms.

On the side of the French Union forces, although they have also completed some specific tasks, such as regrouping and withdrawing troops within the time limit, and assisting to some extent in the transfer of Vietnam People's Army troops, they have committed the following serious violations of the armistice agreement:

First, the French Union forces and the Ngo Dinh Diem government violated the people's right to freely choose to remain in any regrouping area. They used violence to force some civilians to move from North Vietnam to South Vietnam. As of October 15, 1954, a total of 436 incidents of attacks and arrests had occurred, including 26 sweeps, involving troops ranging from two companies to two battalions. Thousands of houses were burned, and hundreds of people were massacred.

Second, regarding the release of prisoners of war, not counting the past massacres and abuses of prisoners of war in various prisons by the other side, many such incidents have occurred since the signing of the armistice agreement. In the five days leading up to August 15, 1954, the managers of a prisoner of war camp on Con Son Island, at the instigation of their masters, beat and injured 22 prisoners of war. To date, the French Union forces have still refused to release more than 8,000 people listed on the list of prisoners of war to be released.

Third, regarding the transfer of administrative power in areas already evacuated by the other side, the other side engaged in acts of sabotage or removal of public property, or incited the Ngo Dinh Diem group to do so. The other side also encouraged hooligans to damage public utilities. In the case of the Hanoi Post Office, the Ngo Dinh Diem group has removed more than 400 tons of machinery and equipment. In the public works department, more than 50 percent of the materials and tools have disappeared or been destroyed. When handing over Hai Duong City, the representatives of the other side tried every possible means to incite their troops and the Ngo Dinh Diem group to plunder or destroy public property before retreating.

The other side and the Ngo Dinh Diem group shamelessly and continuously committed acts of sabotage of the armistice agreement, from signing the aggressive Southeast Asia Treaty to removing materials from public utilities. The most serious violations of the armistice agreement are continuing to force residents of North Vietnam to move to South Vietnam, carrying out terrorist actions and massacres against civilians in areas temporarily stationed by the French Union forces, and retaliating against those who participated in the resistance in these areas.

On August 2, 1954, the first day after the ceasefire, French Union forces fired on women and children in Kim Dai, Thua Thien Province, Central Vietnam, killing 17 and injuring 67, including 18 children aged 8 to 14. In the two days leading up to September 8, French Union forces used weapons of various calibers to fire on residents of Ngan Son, Phu Yen Province. On September 8 and 9, French Union forces committed four terrorist acts in Ha Thuong, Bich La, Cam Lo, and Nam Dong in Quang Tri Province. Recently, French Union forces massacred sixteen civilians and injured more than 500 in Mai Chi, Ben Tre Province, South Vietnam. According to incomplete figures, as of the end of September 1954, 1,596 people had been injured in various terrorist incidents, 526 had been killed, and another 2,415 had been arrested.

In the Bui Chu and Phat Diem areas of Nam Dinh Province, North Vietnam, reactionary elements disguised as priests – running dogs of the US imperialists and the French colonialists who are sabotaging the ceasefire – gathered hundreds and thousands of Catholics in churches, took them to the coast, and forcibly transported them to South Vietnam by boat.

In view of these shameless violations of the armistice agreement, representatives of the Vietnam People's Army stationed in the Central and Local Joint Armistice Commissions have repeatedly protested, urging the other side to stop the above-mentioned acts and severely punish the saboteurs. However, the representatives of the other side have consistently attempted to avoid discussing this issue. Their erroneous attitude has caused many difficulties in the implementation of the armistice agreement and encouraged the saboteurs to continue their activities. The systematic commission of these serious violations of the agreement by the French Union forces indicates that this is not merely the act of certain provocative and undisciplined individuals or military units, but in fact, these violations of the agreement are being carried out by the commanders of the French Union forces. These violations of the agreement have become even more egregious after General Ely issued a statement on August 31, 1954, after Lacoste and Ely held talks with the US government, and after the French government participated in the signing of the aggressive Southeast Asia Treaty.

Peace has been restored in Indochina, but peace has not yet been consolidated. In the hundred days of implementing the armistice agreement, many achievements have been made due to the efforts of the entire Vietnamese army and people. However, during this period, the US imperialists, the French colonialists who are sabotaging the ceasefire agreement, and their running dogs have tried every possible means to sabotage the agreement. Therefore, the Vietnamese people must maintain a high degree of vigilance against this conspiracy. Under the wise leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnam Workers' Party, and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, with the assistance of fraternal countries, the Vietnamese people and army are seriously implementing the armistice agreement and are determined to strive for the victorious completion of consolidating peace, realizing unity, and achieving independence and democracy.

    印度支那停战协定一百天来的执行情况
    ——越南“人民报”十一月三日社论
    日内瓦协定签字已过去一百多天了，印度支那和平恢复也将近一百天了。
    在停火、部队重新集结、运送部队、交换战俘、划定临时军事分界线等步骤中，尽管战线分散而且情况错综复杂，尽管在联络、运输和交通方面有困难，越南人民军、高棉抗战部队和寮国战斗部队已正确地和有效地执行了日内瓦会议达成的协定条款。
    在北越，越南人民军已收复了十二个省内的城镇，其中包括首都河内和海阳城。目前，整个红河三角洲除海防港及其周围地区外都已解放。在人民民主政权下，从农村到城市，越南人民都在热情地积极重建他们遭受战争蹂躏的国家，并且正在为巩固和平而斗争。
    在南越，越南人民军已完成撤出川木—咸津地区和同塔梅平原的工作，并且把中越南部第五联区中的两支部队调到北越，尽管正在雨季，气候恶劣，越南人民军已如期完成了这项工作，并且有效地调动了部队。这是由于人民对军队的热情援助，干部和战士们的努力和遵守纪律的精神，以及兄弟国家首先是苏联的真诚帮助。苏联和波兰派遣船只，协助把军队和干部从南部运往北部，是对越南人民的极大的鼓舞。
    在柬埔寨，高棉抗战部队的战士已遵照日内瓦协定，在停战一月后完成了就地复员的工作。这些战士过去曾经为争取独立、民主和和平而英勇地进行了斗争，他们现在正为实施停战协定和巩固和平而斗争，他们正回到他们的故乡去谋生，为巩固和平、实现统一和民主、实现祖国的独立而继续奋斗。到一九五四年十月十八日，在柬埔寨的越南志愿人员就已完全撤到越南，比日内瓦协定规定的时间早二天。
    在老挝，越南志愿人员将在一九五四年十一月二十日完全撤退。寮国战斗部队的全体战士将集中在丰沙里和桑怒这两个省。尽管战线是在山峦起伏的地区，又值雨季，缺乏交通工具，并且对方还造成了种种困难，寮国战斗部队和越南志愿人员的许多部队却克服了一切困难，在山地上和森林里走了几千公里的路，安然到达了集结区。
    在部队重新集结期间，特别是在艰苦的运送部队期间，柬埔寨人民和老挝人民对抗战部队和越南志愿人员的全力协助，再一次证明军队和人民是团结的，越南、柬埔寨和老挝这三国的人民是团结的。
    在执行停战协定的一百天中，虽然和平的敌人——美帝国主义者和殖民主义者一直在破坏停战协定，他们的仆从歪曲事实，散播诽谤我方的谎言，但是事实已经证明，越南人民军、高棉抗战部队和寮国战斗部队是坚决地认真执行已经协议的条款的。
    在法兰西联邦部队方面，虽然他们也完成了一些具体的工作，如在限期内重新集结和撤退了部队，在某种程度上协助越南人民军部队的转移，但是他们却犯了以下各种严重违反停战协定的行为：
    一、法兰西联邦部队和吴庭艳政府侵犯人民可以自由选择留在任何一方的重新集结地区的权利，他们曾经使用暴力强迫一些平民从北越迁到南越去。到一九五四年十月十五日为止，已发生的袭击和逮捕的事件共计四百三十六起，包括二十六次扫荡，参加扫荡的军队从两连到两营，几千所房屋被焚毁，几百人被屠杀。
    二、在释放战俘方面，且不算对方在过去屠杀和虐待各处监狱中的战俘的事件，在停战协定签订以后已发生了许多次这类的事件。在到一九五四年八月十五日为止的五天中，昆仑岛上一处俘虏营里的管理人在他的主子们的怂恿之下，曾经打死和打伤了二十二名战俘。直到目前为止，法兰西联邦部队方面仍然拒绝释放列在要释放的战俘的名单上的八千多人。
    三、在移交对方已经撤出地区的行政权方面，对方从事破坏或搬走公共财物的行为，或者怂恿吴庭艳集团这样做，对方并鼓励流氓分子破坏公用事业。就河内邮政局而论，吴庭艳集团已经搬走四百多吨机器和设备。在公共工程部门里，有百分之五十以上的物资和工具已经不见或被破坏。在移交海阳城的时候，对方的代表们想尽各种可能的办法，在撤退以前怂恿他们的军队和吴庭艳集团劫掠或者破坏公共财产。
    对方和吴庭艳集团无耻地连续犯了破坏停战协定的行为，从签订侵略性的东南亚条约一直到搬走公用事业中的物资。而最严重的违反停战协定的行为是继续强迫北越居民迁往南越，对在法兰西联邦部队暂时驻扎的地区内的平民采取恐怖行动和屠杀，并对在这些地区内的那些参加过抗战的人施行报复。
    在一九五四年八月二日即停火后第一天，法兰西联邦部队在中越南部承天省金玳向妇女和儿童开枪，打死十七人，打伤六十七人，其中有十八个八岁到十四岁的儿童。在到九月八日为止的两天中，法兰西联邦部队使用口径大小不同的武器向富安省银山居民开枪。在九月八日到九日两天中，法兰西联邦部队在广治省河商、碧罗、甘露、南同犯了四起恐怖行为。最近，法兰西联邦部队在南越槟椥省梅棋枪杀了十六个平民，打伤了五百多人。根据不完全的数字，截至一九五四年九月底为止，在各种恐怖事件中受伤的有一千五百九十六人，被杀的有五百二十六人，另外被逮捕的有两千四百十五人。
    在北越南定省裴朱和发艳地区，披着神甫外衣的反动分子——美帝国主义者和破坏停战的法国殖民主义分子的走狗——把成百上千的天主教徒集中到教堂里去，把他们带到海岸上用船把他们强行运往南越。
    鉴于这些无耻的违反停战协定的行为，驻中央和地方联合停战委员会的越南人民军代表曾多次提出抗议，敦促对方制止上述行为，并严惩破坏分子。但是对方的代表一直企图避开对这个问题的讨论。他们所持的错误态度已对执行停战协定造成了许多困难，并且鼓励了破坏分子继续进行他们的活动。法兰西联邦部队方面有系统地进行这些严重地破坏协定的行为，说明这不仅是某些挑衅和不守纪律的分子或部队单位的作为，而且实际上这些违反协定的行为，是法兰西联邦部队的司令官们所进行的。在一九五四年八月三十一日埃利将军发表声明后，在拉香波、埃利同美国政府举行会谈以及法国政府参加签订侵略性的东南亚条约以后，这些违反协定的行为更加变本加厉了。
    和平已在印度支那恢复，但是和平还没有巩固。在执行停战协定的一百天中，由于全体越南军民所作的努力，已经得到了许多成就。但是，在这个期间，美帝国主义者、破坏停战协定的法国殖民主义分子和他们的走狗们，想尽了各种办法来破坏协定。因此，越南人民必须对这个阴谋保持高度的警惕。在胡志明主席、越南劳动党和越南民主共和国政府的英明领导下，加上各兄弟国家的援助，越南人民和军队认真地执行停战协定，并且坚决地为胜利地完成巩固和平、实现统一和达成独立和民主而奋斗。　（新华社据越南通讯社河内三日讯）
