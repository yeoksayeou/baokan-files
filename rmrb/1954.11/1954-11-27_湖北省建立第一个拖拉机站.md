Hubei Province's first agricultural machinery tractor station has been established in Jianggou District, Xiangyang County. Currently, the DT-54 tractors, equipped with five-furrow plows, are working on the fields of Xianghuo, Xianggao, Guoguang, Hongguang, and Gonggu, five agricultural producers' cooperatives near the tractor station, winter plowing at a rate of just over four minutes per mu.

The Jianggou Agricultural Tractor Station held a trial cultivation ceremony in early November to mark its establishment. This station will gradually implement mechanized farming on hundreds of thousands of mu of land near the Jianggou District of Xiangyang County. The farmers here are very excited, and the number of farmers requesting to join the producers' cooperatives is rapidly increasing. (Xinhua News Agency)

    湖北省建立第一个拖拉机站
    湖北省第一个农业机器拖拉机站已经在襄阳县姜沟区成立了。现在，德特五四型拖拉机带着五铧犁，正在这个拖拉机站附近的襄伙、襄郜、国光、红光、巩固等五个农业生产合作社的田地上，以四分多钟犁一亩地的速度进行着冬耕。
    姜沟农业拖拉机站在十一月上旬举行了建站试耕。这个站将在襄阳县姜沟区附近数十万亩土地上逐步实行机械化耕作。这里的农民很兴奋，要求加入生产合作社的农户迅速增加。　　　（新华社）
