    Visiting the Collective Farm in Herman Village, Stalin City
    Ma Nan
    September 19th was the seventh day of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe's tour in Romania. At 11:00 AM, the troupe's special bus arrived in Stalin City at the foot of the Donba Peak in the Carpathian Mountains. Stalin City was formerly known as Brasov. The people of Brasov requested that it be named after the great Stalin to commemorate the Soviet army's liberation of the city. This is an important industrial city in Romania, home to the Telman Tractor Factory and the Red Flag Truck Factory.
    After getting off the bus, the comrades of the Song and Dance Troupe received a grand welcome from more than 10,000 people. Accompanied by the Secretary of the Stalin Region Workers' Party Committee, they took accordions, flutes, sheng, erhus, and some necessary props to visit Romania's famous model collective farm—the Tudor Vladimirescu Collective Farm in Herman Village. This collective farm is only eight kilometers away from Stalin City. The troupe's cars advanced along the wide asphalt road parallel to the railway line. After a turn, in less than five minutes, they saw a green forest and the occasional red roofs. Comrade Augustine, the secretary of the Regional Committee sitting in front of me, pointed to the red-roofed houses directly in front and said, "This is Herman Village." From the village's outline, it did not look like a village but rather a tranquil and beautiful small town immersed in a peaceful atmosphere.
    Herman Village, like a close-up shot in a film, gradually expanded before our eyes. At the intersection of the road opposite, stood a tall archway painted in red, with a banner written in Chinese characters: "Welcome, great Chinese artistic envoys." Welcoming crowds lined the road from outside the village to inside. The motorcade of the song and dance troupe passed through the bright red archway, and children followed the cars, raising their small faces and smiling as they threw flowers into the car windows.
    The cars stopped in front of the courtyard. An elderly member of the Tudor Vladimirescu Farm, dressed in a black suit and holding a plate of sliced bread, welcomed their Chinese guests. This is a ritual they use to welcome distinguished guests. Collective farm chairman Croca Ivan, a simple farmer in his forties, gave a warm welcoming speech. Then, we were surrounded by the crowd and walked through the glass-paneled vestibule into the office of the collective farm.
    Chairman Croca Ivan introduced the situation of their farm to us.
    The Tudor Vladimirescu Farm was organized and built in 1950 by 44 poor peasant households. Initially, it had only 136 hectares of arable land, 8 hectares of grassland, and wasteland. Under the leadership of the Workers' Party District Committee and the People's Committee, and with the help of the tractor station, advanced farming methods were implemented. In the first year, production reached 2,020 kilograms per hectare, an increase of 1,400 kilograms compared to the original. Now, 246 households have joined the farm. The farm owns 1,020 hectares of land, 62 horses, 74 dairy cows, 59 pigs, as well as sheepfolds, apiaries, and a wood and iron tool factory for repairing and manufacturing simple farm implements. It is already a wealthy large collective farm.
    The farm chairman and male and female members enthusiastically led us to visit their pigsties, where there were large pigs weighing 260 kilograms. Each pig averaged ten piglets per litter, with a record of up to seventeen. Six pregnant pigs had separate, more comfortable pigsties. A row of pigsties were all painted white, and lime was sprinkled on the sidewalks. Diagonally across from the pigsties was the farm implements room, where various machine plows were parked.
    In front of the stable, the 61-year-old old feeder, Leva Lebitru, waved to us with a smile when he saw us, inviting us into the stable to see the fat, shiny, tall horses he raised. This old feeder, who has fed horses for forty years, has been a member of the farm for three years. When we asked him what was different before and after joining the farm, he proudly told us that he earned the equivalent of 300 labor days' wages in 1953, totaling 3,128 kilograms of grain and vegetables, plus 2,400 lei (Romanian currency). He has eight people in his family, and his six children have all grown up and live independently. He is now living very well.
    We left the stable and walked along the pebble road towards the northwest corner of the village, seeing a tall building from afar. We thought it was the collective farm's auditorium. When we got to the door, we realized that it was a newly built spacious and clean cow house. Inside, cement walls divided the space into sixteen cow beds on the left and right sides. The dairy cows were comfortably lying on thick yellow grass. The calves to be weaned were separated in nearby pens. The feeder, George Mentianu, and his wife, Anna Mentianu, fed twenty dairy cows here. The husband fed the cows, and the wife milked them. Last year, the couple did 960 labor days of work, earning 7,000 lei, 8,700 kilograms of grain and vegetables, and 10,000 kilograms of straw. Before joining the collective farm, they were poor peasants. In the past four years, their lives have become more and more prosperous. Their family of seven lives happily. Their fifteen-year-old eldest son has entered a tractor school and will become a tractor driver. From this pair of simple, middle-aged farmers, we saw a new type of farmer who loves labor and is full of hope for the future.
    Leaving the dairy farm, Comrade Croca Ivan pointed to a large area of newly built houses in the distance and said: These are newly built houses for the expansion of the farm. Soon they will be used as granaries or other purposes. He said: Last year, the farm's total income was 800,000 lei, and it only paid 8% of agricultural tax to the state. The rest was all enjoyed by the collective farm and the members individually. He also specifically told us: In addition to sharing the collective production, 75% of the farmers also have their own dairy cows. In order to take care of children and the elderly who have lost their ability to work, the farm uses 2% of its total income for this purpose. Therefore, the elderly can live well even without labor!
    A large stage had been built on the big square in front of the village, surrounded by pine branches and flowers, and four microphones stood in the center of the stage. Electric wires and loudspeakers were erected in the middle of the square, and farmers came to the square in groups. Farmers from nearby villages came by horse-drawn carriages and trucks to watch the song and dance troupe's performance. Four large buses were parked behind the stage, now being used as temporary dressing rooms. In less than half an hour after we arrived, the square was already crowded with people. The secretary of the Regional Committee said: "The original plan was for 12,000 people, but there is no way to control it. At the people's request, it has now reached almost 20,000." Some stood on chairs, some climbed on the roofs of large buses, and some climbed on the high frame of the swings, while others simply drove their horse-drawn carriages and trucks to places far away from the stage and stood on them in order to see the stage over the countless moving heads. The three hundred or so Young Pioneers wearing red scarves were given preferential seating on the lawn in the first four or five rows. The innocent little smiling faces of the children sparkled and turned under the sunlight. Behind them on the chairs were the elderly grandfathers and grandmothers, some of whom were already white-haired and holding crutches. The Romanian folk band temporarily dispatched from the Stalin region, dressed in brand-new national costumes, played Romanian folk music with extremely fast-paced melodies during each intermission. Our song and dance troupe played "Long Live Mao Zedong" and several Romanian songs: "George, Goes to the Army," "Song of the Peace Warrior," and "Yenina," which received a tidal wave of applause; other dance programs also left a deep impression on the audience's minds. Even after the performance ended, people were still talking about it.
    The grassland outside Herman Village was as lively as a temple fair. Women's colorful summer dresses fluttered gently in the breeze, scattered across half of the village.
    Collective farm chairman Croca Ivan and many farm members surrounded their Chinese guests and walked down a street, pointing to a gate and inviting us to enter. Passing through a small courtyard and a hall filled with wheat straw, we arrived at a large orchard with lush trees that stretched as far as the eye could see. Next to the ridges with large, bright red tomatoes, two rows of banquet tables had already been set up, extending for more than 30 meters. The tables covered with snow-white tablecloths were piled with various wine bottles, soda bottles, cups, plates, and dishes filled with rose grapes, plump green grapes that looked like plums, green and red peppers the size of corn cobs, tomatoes, boiled eggs the size of duck eggs, "Kiss" made from cow and goat milk, and exquisite sausages. The farm chairman led the guests to their seats. At this time, the two rows of seats in the distance were already filled with the collective farm's model workers, both male and female, elderly seniors—grandfathers, grandfathers, grandmothers, and grandmothers, and young mothers still holding their babies in swaddling clothes. Comrade Croca Ivan stood up to give a speech. He briefly expressed his gratitude for the performance and visit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe, and he also asked the comrades of the Song and Dance Troupe to convey the warm greetings and care of all the collective farm members of Herman Village to the Chinese farmers after returning home. He finally apologized to the guests, saying: "There are not many things in the countryside. The food at the banquet is all harvested and made by our farm itself. Please forgive the guests." His words were so sincere that we forgot that we were abroad. From this rich banquet, we saw the happy, well-fed life brought to all farm members by the Tudor Vladimirescu Collective Farm on the path of collectivization, which set a good example for all working farmers in Romania.
    The banquet proceeded in an atmosphere full of sincere friendship. Hosts and guests frequently raised their glasses to congratulate each other and say hello. The male and female actors of the song and dance troupe poured full glasses of wine and walked to the model workers and grandmothers and grandfathers, wishing them and their farm new achievements and wishing the elderly longevity. Amidst the laughter, the farm chairman presented gifts to the guests on behalf of all the members. Inside a square glass box covered with brocade, were placed small paring knives made by their tool factory and more than a dozen beautifully woven handbags made of straw and wheat stalks, which were woven by the farm women especially for their Chinese guests.
    The afterglow of the setting sun shone obliquely on the treetops of the orchard, reflecting a fiery golden light. The Romanian folk dance Bolenița music resounded in the orchard. The elderly, young people, children, men, and women, officers and soldiers from China and Romania, linked arms, formed a circle, and danced around, the green orchard immersed in boundless joy.

    访问斯大林城赫尔曼村的集体农庄
    马楠
    九月十九日，这是中国人民解放军歌舞团在罗马尼亚巡回演出的第七天。上午十一点钟，歌舞团的专车来到了喀尔巴阡山顿巴峰下的斯大林城。斯大林城原名布拉索夫，是布拉索夫市人民为纪念苏军解放该城而请求以伟大的斯大林的名字命名的。这是罗马尼亚重要的工业城市，台尔曼拖拉机工厂、红旗卡车制造厂都在这里。
    歌舞团的同志们下车后，接受了一万多群众的盛大欢迎，然后就在斯大林州工人党州委员会书记的陪同下，带着手风琴、笛、笙、二胡和一些必需的道具去访问罗马尼亚著名的模范集体农庄——赫尔曼村的土多尔·沃拉底米列斯古集体农庄。这个集体农庄距斯大林城只有八公里路，歌舞团的汽车沿着和铁路线平行的宽阔的柏油公路前进，转一个弯，不到五分钟，就望见了一片碧绿的丛林和时隐时现的红色屋顶。坐在我前面的州委员会书记奥古斯丁同志手指着正前方的那一片红屋顶的房子说：“这就是赫尔曼村。”从这个村的轮廓看去，它并不像是村，而是一个恬静幽美浸透在和平气氛中的小城镇。
    赫尔曼村像影片中的特写镜头一样，渐渐地在我们眼前扩大起来。对面的大路口耸立着一座涂着红漆的高大牌楼，上面用中国文字写着“欢迎你们，伟大的中国艺术使者们”的横额。欢迎的群众夹道从村外排到村里。歌舞团的汽车行列穿过鲜红的牌楼，儿童们跟着汽车，他们仰起小脸，笑着朝车窗内投掷鲜花。
    汽车在一个庭院的门前停下了。土多尔·沃拉底米列斯古农庄的一个老年庄员，身穿黑礼服，手里托着一盘已经切成片的大面包，迎接他们的中国客人。这是他们迎接贵宾的一种仪式。集体农庄主席克罗卡·伊凡同志，是一个四十多岁的朴实的农民，他热情洋溢地致了欢迎词。然后，我们被人群簇拥着，穿过嵌着玻璃的避风走廊，走进集体农庄的办公室。
    克罗卡·伊凡主席为我们介绍了他们农庄的情况。
    土多尔·沃拉底米列斯古农庄是在一九五○年由四十四家贫农开始组织和建设起来的。最初只有一百三十六公顷可耕地，八公顷草地和荒地。在工人党区委员会、人民委员会的领导下，在拖拉机站的帮助下，实行了先进的耕作法，第一年生产量便达到每公顷二千零二十公斤，较原来增加一千四百公斤。现在参加农庄的已有二百四十六家，农庄已拥有一千零二十公顷土地，六十二匹马，七十四头奶牛，五十九头猪，此外尚有羊圈、养蜂场和一个修理、制造简单农具的木、铁工具厂。它已经是一个富有的大集体农庄了。
    农庄主席和男女庄员们热情殷切地带领我们参观了他们的猪房，这儿有着二百六十公斤重的大猪。每个猪平均一次下十个小猪，最高纪录曾达到十七个。怀孕的六头猪另有单独的较为舒适的猪房。一排猪房都粉刷得雪白，人行道上都撒有石灰。在猪房的斜对过是农具房，那儿停放着各式机器犁。
    在马棚门前，六十一岁的乐瓦列毕特鲁老饲养员看见我们时，笑眯眯的挥手让我们进马棚内看他养的肥得发光的高大的马。这个喂了四十年马的老饲养员加入农庄已经三年了。当我们问他参加农庄前后有什么不同时，他很自豪地告诉我们说，他在一九五三年挣了三百个劳动日的工薪，共收入三千一百二十八公斤的粮食和蔬菜，还有两千四百列伊（罗币）。他家里有八口人，六个孩子都已成人独立生活去了，他现在生活得非常富裕。
    我们出了马棚，穿过石子路的大街朝村西北角走去，老远望见一座高大的房屋。我们原以为是集体农庄的礼堂，走到门口，才发觉它是新盖的一座宽敞清洁的牛房。房中用水泥墙隔成左右两排十六个牛床，奶牛安逸而舒适地卧在厚厚的黄草上，要断奶的小牛，另隔在附近的牛栏里。饲养员乔治·孟田努和他的妻子安娜·孟田努两人在这里喂着二十只奶牛，丈夫喂牛，妻子挤奶，去年一年他们夫妇两人作了九百六十个劳动日的工作，收入七千个列伊、八千七百公斤粮食和蔬菜，还有一万公斤稻草。他们参加集体农庄前是贫农，四年来他们的生活越来越富裕了，他们一家七口人，生活得很幸福。十五岁的大儿子已进了拖拉机学校，将成为拖拉机手。从这一对朴实的壮年农民身上，我们看到了那种对于劳动的热爱和对于未来充满了希望的新型农民。
    从奶牛场出来，克罗卡·伊凡同志指着远处一大片新盖的房子说：这是为了扩大农庄而新建设的房子，不久它们将被用来作粮仓或其他用途。他说：去年一年农庄全部收入八十万列伊，向国家只缴纳了百分之八的农业税，其余全部为集体农庄和庄员个人享用。他还特别告诉我们：每一个农户除分得集体生产的收获物外，百分之七十五的农户还有自己的奶牛。为了照顾小孩和丧失了劳动力的老年人，农庄以全部收入的百分之二作为此项费用，因此老年人虽没有劳动力，也能生活得很好！
    村前的大广场上已经筑起一座大舞台，四周扎着松枝和鲜花，四座麦克风竖立在台中央。广场中央半空中架起电线和扩音喇叭，农民成群结队的来到广场，附近村庄的农民们有的乘马车，有的乘大卡车赶来看歌舞团的演出。舞台背后停着四辆大客车，它们现在被做为临时的化装室。我们到后不到半小时，广场上已成人山人海，州委书记说：“原计划一万二千人，没有办法，群众的要求，现在差不多已达两万人了。”有的站在椅子上，有的爬在大客车的顶棚上，有的攀登在秋千的高架顶上，有的干脆把自己的马车、卡车开到距舞台远远的地方，站在上面，以便使自己的视线越过无数钻动的头顶而望见舞台。戴红领巾的三百多少年先锋队队员被优待坐在前四五排的草坪上，孩子们一张张天真的小笑脸在太阳光下闪烁着，转动着。他们后排的椅子上便是年迈的老爷爷和老祖母们，其中有的已是白发苍苍，持着拐杖。临时由斯大林州派来的罗马尼亚民间乐队，穿着崭新的民族服装，在每一个节目的间隙就演奏起那旋律跳动极快的罗马尼亚民间乐曲。我们的歌舞团演奏了“万岁毛泽东”和几支罗马尼亚歌曲：“乔治，参军去了”、“和平战士之歌”、“叶妮娜”等，获得海啸般的掌声；其他一些舞蹈节目，也在观众的脑子里留下了深刻的印象。直到散场，人们还在议论不止。
    赫尔曼村外的草场上像赶庙会一样热闹。妇女们五颜六色的夏季衣裙在微风中轻轻飘荡着，斑斑点点撒满了半个村庄。
    集体农庄主席克罗卡·伊凡同志和许多农庄庄员簇拥着他们的中国客人们走过一条街，指着一个大门让我们进去。穿过一个小小的院落和一间堆满了麦草的穿堂，便是绿树成荫一眼望不到边际的大果木园，在那结着硕大鲜红番茄的畦垅旁边，早已摆设好了两排宴席桌，长达三十余公尺。铺的雪白桌布的桌子上堆满了各种酒瓶、汽水瓶、杯子，盘碟上面放了玫瑰葡萄，肥大的像李子似的青葡萄，像玉蜀黍棒大小的青红辣椒，番茄，像鸭蛋那样大的煮熟了的鸡蛋，用牛奶羊奶制成的“吉斯”，考究的腊肠，……。农庄主席把客人让上座。这时远处两排席位上已坐满了作陪的农庄的男女劳动模范，年老的长辈——老爷爷，老爹爹，老祖母和老妈妈，年青的母亲还抱着自己强褓中的娃娃。克罗卡·伊凡同志起立致词，他简短的表示了感谢中国人民解放军歌舞团的演出和访问，他还托歌舞团同志们回国后转达赫尔曼村全体集体农庄庄员对于中国农民的亲切问候和关怀。他最后抱歉地向客人说：“乡下东西不多，宴席上的食物全是我们农庄自己收获和制作的，请客人们原谅。”他的话是那样诚恳，使我们有一种忘记了自己是在国外的感觉。我们从这个丰富的宴席上，看到了土多尔·沃拉底米列斯古集体农庄在走集体化的道路上给予全体庄员带来的丰衣足食的幸福生活，它给罗马尼亚的全体劳动农民作了一个良好的榜样。
    宴会在充满了真挚友谊的气氛里进行，主人和客人们频频举杯互相祝贺和问好，歌舞团的男女演员们斟了满杯的酒走到劳动模范和老祖母、老爹爹们面前，祝他们和她们的农庄获得新的成就，祝老人们长寿。在欢笑声中，农庄主席代表全体庄员向客人献礼。一个一方尺长宽的铺了锦缎的玻璃方盒内，置有他们工具厂自造的小削刀，和十多只用稻草和麦杆编得极为美丽的手提包，这是农庄妇女们特为他们的中国客人编织的。
    夕阳的余晖斜射在果木园的树梢上，映射出火红的金光，园内响起了罗马尼亚民间舞蹈伯力尼查乐曲，老年人，青年人，小孩，男人，妇女们，中罗两国的军官们，士兵们手臂挽起来，结成一个圆圈，旋转着舞起来了，绿色的果木园沉浸在无边的欢乐中。
