Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, November 15th: The Indonesian Communist Party is carrying out an election campaign under the slogan of strengthening the solidarity of the whole nation and fighting against the conspiracies of the imperialists.

    The Indonesian "People's Daily" reported that the Communist Party held a rally in Cirebon, Central Java, attended by 100,000 people. The General Secretary of the Communist Party, D.N. Aidit, delivered a speech at the meeting. He said: We need the closest cooperation between national, religious and communist organizations, which will be the best answer to the conspiracies of the imperialists and traitors. Those traitors, as President Sukarno pointed out, are selling out our country for millions of dollars.

    Aidit emphasized that the most important tasks facing the whole nation are: to drive the Dutch imperialists out of the banks, sugar factories and oil industry, to eliminate the "Darul Islam" bandit gangs and to return West Irian to the Republic.

    According to the Indonesian "People's Daily," Aidit's proposal to establish a broad national front was warmly supported by the conference.

    In Pacitan, East Java, a conference was also held under the slogan of strengthening the unity of the people of the whole country, attended by 30,000 workers and farmers.
