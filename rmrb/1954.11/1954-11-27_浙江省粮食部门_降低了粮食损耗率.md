Zhejiang Province Grain Department
    Reduces Grain Loss Rate
    After the grain departments in various parts of Zhejiang Province promoted the advanced grain storage experience of the YuHang County Grain Bureau, the grain loss rate for the entire province this year has decreased from 0.117% last year to 0.103%. There are now 6,421 insect-free granaries in the province, and 1,209 "Four-Without" (no insects, no mold, no rats, no sparrows) granaries have emerged in the Jiaxing and Ningbo Special Districts.
    In February of this year, grain departments in various parts of the province generally adopted measures such as grain storage census and classification, mold prevention and insect control, and sanitation campaigns in a timely manner with seasonal changes, stipulating an inspection system of "a major inspection every five days and a minor inspection every three days." When the mold season arrived, many grain storage personnel demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm, drew up grain drying plans, and dried some grains with high moisture content. During the flood season, grain storage personnel transferred and rescued stored grain overnight. (Xinhua News Agency)

    浙江省粮食部门
    降低了粮食损耗率
    浙江省各地粮食部门在推广余杭县粮食局先进保粮经验后，全省今年粮食损耗率已由去年的百分之零点一一七降低到百分之零点一零三。全省现有无虫粮仓六千四百二十一座，嘉兴、宁波两专区并出现了一千二百零九座“四无”（无虫、无霉、无鼠、无雀）粮仓。
    今年二月，全省各地粮食部门大都随着季节变化适时地采取了储粮普查排队、防霉杀虫、清洁卫生运动等措施，规定了“五日一大查，三日一小查”的检查制度。当霉季来临时，很多保粮人员发挥了高度积极性，订出晒粮计划，把一些水份高的粮食晒干。防洪期间，保粮人员又连夜转移和抢救存粮。　　（新华社）
