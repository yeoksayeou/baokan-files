Correctly Implement the Guidelines for Improving the Quality of Primary and Secondary Education

    The work of improving the quality of primary and secondary education has attracted the attention of various regions. Party committees in Beijing, Jiangxi, and other places have successively issued decisions on improving the quality of primary and secondary education, and some regions have also taken corresponding specific measures. Now, many schools have a new atmosphere: teachers are more serious and responsible for teaching than in the past, and teaching and examination systems in various subjects are being seriously implemented; some of the lax phenomena in schools in the past have changed, and study life is more fulfilling and intense than before; and the academic performance of many students has begun to improve.

    However, recently some abnormal phenomena have also occurred in some schools. These phenomena include sudden increases in students' learning burdens, so that most students cannot rest on time, often get up early and go to bed late, and the number of people participating in cultural and recreational activities and physical exercise has decreased significantly, and the time for current affairs study has also been squeezed out.

    The main reason for this phenomenon is that the teaching plan outlines formulated by the educational administrative departments in some places are too demanding, and the teaching reference materials compiled are too heavy, deviating from the original foundation of general schools. At the same time, there is a lack of specific guidance for teachers in the process of improving the quality of education, and some teachers do not know what steps to take to improve the quality of education, but only increase the learning burden of students. It should be pointed out that in order to improve the quality of education, it is necessary for educational administrative departments to formulate unified teaching plan outlines or compile certain teaching reference materials and establish standards for outstanding achievements. However, when carrying out these tasks, it is necessary to take into account the general teaching situation of each school and the original level of teachers and students. The educational administrative departments in some places have ignored this point, only seeing the level of excellent schools and Soviet standards, and not studying the local actual situation and the standards that can be achieved. This approach is not correct.

    Secondly, it is correct to pay attention to improving the knowledge level of students in the work of improving the quality of school education; however, while improving the knowledge level of students, political and ideological education and physical exercise must not be ignored. To improve the quality of education, in the final analysis, is to cultivate students to become all-round developed members of socialist society. This means that students should not only have scientific knowledge, but also socialist ideology and a healthy physique. Therefore, while improving the knowledge level of students, we must improve their socialist consciousness and strengthen their physique.

    The main factors that directly determine the improvement of the quality of school education are teachers, teaching materials, and teaching methods. Educational administrative departments and school leaders should actively take effective measures to organize and lead teachers to conduct amateur learning, study teaching materials, and improve teaching methods to improve educational effectiveness. Educational administrative departments should also strengthen the inspection and guidance of schools and strengthen teaching leadership. Regardless of educational administrative cadres or school leaders, they should seriously study their profession, truly become experts, overcome generalized leadership methods, give teachers specific guidance, and effectively solve the difficulties in teachers' teaching.

    In the work of improving the quality of education, attention should be paid to the timely exchange of teachers' experience. A good teaching plan outline cannot play its due role if it cannot be mastered by teachers. Currently, some places are implementing new teaching plan outlines, which is a completely new task for the majority of teachers; however, in the process of practice, some teachers have explored some experience and have begun to achieve results in their work. The educational administrative departments in various places should attach great importance to these experiences, promote them among teachers at any time, so that they can be mastered by the majority of teachers, so as to gradually improve the quality of education.

### 正确地执行关于提高中小学教育质量的方针

    正确地执行关于提高中小学教育质量的方针
    提高中小学教育质量的工作，已引起各地的重视。北京、江西等地的党委已相继发布了关于提高中小学教育质量的决定，有些地区还采取了相应的具体措施。现在，许多学校已出现了新的气象：教师们对教学工作比过去认真负责了，各科教学制度和考试制度认真地执行了；过去学校中的某些松散现象已有所改变，学习生活比过去充实紧张；许多学生的学习成绩开始有了提高。
    但是，最近在某些学校中也产生了一些不够正常的现象，这就是骤然增加了学生的学习负担，以致大部分学生不能按时作息，经常早起晚睡，参加文化娱乐活动和体育锻炼的人数显著减少，时事学习的时间也被挤掉。
    造成这一现象的主要原因是某些地方的教育行政部门所制定的授课计划纲要要求过高，编写的教学参考材料份量太重，脱离了一般学校的原有基础；同时，在提高教育质量的过程中对教师缺乏具体的指导，一部分教师不知道按照怎样的步骤来提高教育质量，只是增加学生的学习负担。应该指出：为了提高教育质量，由教育行政部门制定统一授课计划纲要或编写某些教学参考材料，树立优秀成绩的标准是必要的，但是在进行这些工作时，必须照顾到各学校一般的教学情况和教师和学生的原有水平。某些地方的教育行政部门忽略了这一点，只看到优秀学校的水平和苏联的标准，而不去研究本地的实际情况和可能达到的标准，这种作法是不对的。
    其次，在提高学校教育质量工作中注意提高学生们的知识水平，这是正确的；但是，在提高学生的知识水平的同时，决不能忽视政治思想教育和身体锻炼。提高教育质量，归根到底就是要培养学生成为社会主义社会全面发展的成员。这就是说，要使学生不但具有科学知识，而且还要具有社会主义思想和健康的体格。因此，在提高学生的知识水平的同时，必须提高他们的社会主义觉悟，锻炼他们的体格。
    直接对提高学校教育质量起决定作用的，主要是教师、教材和教法。教育行政部门和学校负责人，应积极采取有效的办法组织领导教师进行业余学习，钻研教材和改进教法，以提高教育效果。教育行政部门并应加强对学校的视导工作，加强教学领导。不论教育行政干部，不论学校领导干部，都应当认真钻研业务，真正成为内行，克服一般化的领导方法，给教师们以具体的指导，切实解决教师教学中的困难。
    在提高教育质量工作中，应当注意及时交流教师的经验。好的授课计划纲要，如果不能为教师所掌握，那就不能发挥应有的作用。目前有些地方正执行新的授课计划纲要，这对广大教师来说是一件全新的工作；但是，在实践过程中已经有一部分教师摸索到一些经验，并在工作中开始做出了成绩。各地教育行政部门应当十分重视这些经验，随时在教师中加以推广，使之为广大教师所掌握，以便逐步地提高教育质量。
