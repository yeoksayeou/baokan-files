Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 14th -- Jiangxi Province's administrative organs and enterprises have achieved results in their work of practicing thrift and opposing waste. According to statistics from 15 units, including the Provincial Department of Finance, the Department of Education, and the Department of Industry, they can increase production and save approximately 300 billion yuan for the state in the second half of this year.

In the past three months alone, administrative organs at all levels throughout the province, in the spirit of practicing thrift, have tightened up various administrative and operational expenses that could be done away with or should not have been undertaken, saving the state over 83 billion yuan. The Provincial Department of Education initially calculated at the beginning of the year that the province's annual education expenditure was short 8 billion yuan, requiring state compensation. Recently, under the principle of "use what is needed, reduce what should be reduced, and resolutely do not use what is not needed," they recalculated the annual operating expenses, and the result was that not only was it unnecessary to request an additional 8 billion yuan from the state, but they also saved 7 billion yuan from the funds originally allocated by the state, which could be turned over to the state, while the operational plan could still be completed as planned. Yi Pengfei, a staff member of the Nanchang Office of the Jiangxi Forest Industry Bureau, proposed a suggestion to simplify the procedures for collecting afforestation fees. It is estimated that this suggestion, if implemented only in the 30 timber purchasing units under the Nanchang Office, could save the state more than 45,000 documents and reduce the waiting time for forestry farmers by more than 4,000 hours in three months. The staff of the newly built Jiangxi Textile Factory, a local state-owned enterprise, have been finding ways to reduce the average raw cotton consumption per yarn since September, from more than 415 jin in June to 396 jin. Now, the factory staff are striving to achieve the state-stipulated target of 393 jin for the average raw cotton consumption per yarn.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou -- State-owned, locally state-owned, and joint state-private factories and mines in Guangdong Province have successively formulated plans for increasing production and practicing thrift.

The province's five state-owned sugar refineries are focusing on planning and supplying raw materials this year, and have started production ahead of schedule in early November. Because the sugarcane yield in Guangdong has increased this year, these sugar refineries have set plans to overfulfill the state's output value plan by 3% to 20%. Various non-ferrous metal mines are focusing on improving production management, promoting deep-hole blasting methods and other advanced operating methods to ensure the comprehensive completion and overfulfillment of the state's production plan.

Before formulating their production increase and thrift plans, twenty-one state-owned, locally state-owned, and joint state-private factories and enterprises in Guangzhou City inspected the implementation of the state plan from January to July this year, identified outstanding problems in production, and solved them. After resolving the production accident of the second rotary kiln, reducing coal and electricity consumption, and other issues, the staff of the state-owned Xicun Cement Factory proposed to increase production and save more than 13 billion yuan for the year, and guaranteed to complete the annual state output plan 27 days ahead of schedule. In the fourth quarter, the Guangzhou Electric Power Bureau will increase production and save 9.7 billion yuan by increasing power generation and sales, reducing coal consumption, and reducing plant electricity consumption and line losses.

Factories and mines in Yuezhong, Yuedong, Yuebei, Yuexi, and Hainan regions have also carefully checked the implementation of the production plan for the first three quarters of this year, studied the main problems existing in the current factories and mines, and formulated preliminary plans for increasing production and practicing thrift and specific measures to achieve the plans. In Yuezhong District, the machinery, shipbuilding, and sugar industries, which have completed their production plans relatively well and have no problems with supply and marketing in the three quarters of this year, have determined that large factories will increase production by 10% and small factories will increase production by 5%.

    江西省各级行政机关和企业部门
    厉行节约反对浪费的工作有成效
    广东省许多工厂、矿山订出增产节约计划
    【新华社南昌十四日电】江西省人民政府所属各行政机关和企业部门开展的厉行节约、反对浪费的工作已获得成效。据省财政厅、教育厅、工业厅等十五个单位的统计：今年下半年可给国家增产节约约三千多亿元的资金。
    仅近三个月来，全省各级行政机关本着厉行节约的精神，紧缩各种可办可不办和不应该办的行政、事业费用，就给国家节省了八百三十多亿元。省人民政府教育厅今年年初核算全省全年教育经费时还缺少八十亿元，需要国家弥补。最近，他们在“需用就用，当减则减，不需用的就坚决不用”的原则下，重新核算了全年事业费，结果不仅不需要再要求国家增加八十亿元经费，而且在国家原来已经拨下的经费中节省出了七十亿元可以上缴给国家，事业计划还能照样完成。江西森林工业局南昌办事处工作人员易鹏飞，提出了简化征收育林费手续的建议。据推算，这个建议仅在南昌办事处所属的三十个木材收购单位实行，三个月就能给国家节省四万五千多份票据和减少林农们的等候时间四千多个小时。新建地方国营江西纺织厂的职工，自九月份以来他们就从各方面设法把每件纱的平均原棉消耗量由六月份的四百一十五斤多降低到三百九十六斤。现在，这个厂的职工正在争取使每件纱的平均原棉消耗量达到国家规定的三百九十三斤的指标。
    【新华社广州讯】广东省国营、地方国营和公私合营各工厂、矿山纷纷制订出增产节约计划。
    省内的五个国营糖厂今年着重做好原料的计划供应工作，并已提前在十一月初开榨生产。因为今年广东的甘蔗产量增多，所以这些糖厂订出超额完成国家产值计划百分之三到百分之二十的计划。各有色金属矿山着重改进生产管理，推广深眼爆破法和其他先进操作法，以保证全面完成和超额完成国家的生产计划。
    广州市国营、地方国营和公私合营二十一个工厂企业在制订增产节约计划之前，都曾检查了今年一月到七月执行国家计划的情况，找出生产上存在的突出问题加以解决。国营西村水泥厂职工在解决了第二回转窑的生产事故、降低煤耗和电耗等问题以后，提出全年增产节约一百三十多亿元，并保证提前二十七天完成全年国家产量计划。广州电业局第四季度将从增加发电量、售电量，降低煤耗、减少厂用电和线路损失等各方面，增产节约九十七亿元。
    粤中、粤东、粤北、粤西和海南等地区的工厂、矿山也都认真检查了今年前三个季度生产计划的执行情况，并研究了目前各厂矿中存在的主要问题，订出增产节约的初步计划和实现计划的具体措施。粤中区今年三个季度以来生产计划完成得较好、供销没有问题的机械、造船、制糖等行业，已确定大厂增产百分之十，小厂增产百分之五。
