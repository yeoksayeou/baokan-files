　　Everyone Should Protect Surveying Buildings

To the Editor:

　　With the development of the nation's socialist construction, geodetic surveying work has been launched throughout the country. Some of the basic construction related to surveying work, such as various steel markers and wooden markers built on the ground (i.e., steel towers and wooden towers ranging from four meters to dozens of meters in height, each worth several million to over twenty million yuan), and underground survey markers like triangulation points, leveling points, and azimuth points (made of concrete and steel cores), are not only important indicators and data for our country's current construction projects, but also precious assets of the state and the people for generations to come. Each marker can be used and referenced by us for hundreds of years. However, because Party committees and governments in various places have not conducted enough publicity and education among the masses, and the professional departments have not explained things clearly enough, many people do not understand the significance of geodetic surveying work, so the surveying buildings in various survey areas cannot be well protected and even suffer serious damage. In mid-August of this year, when I accompanied the Yellow River Conservancy Commission's surveying work inspection team to western Henan, southwestern Shanxi, and Guanzhong in Shaanxi for inspection, we found several incidents of damage to surveying buildings in one team's survey area. For example, in early July of this year, the masses of Caotan Village, Caotan Township, Dali County, Shaanxi Province, completely removed the flags, bamboo poles, and other items from the newly built triangulation point of the Yellow River Surveying Team's selection group. This spring, the newly buried marker stone of the second-order triangulation point on Phoenix Mountain in Chunhua County, Shaanxi, was smashed, and the steel core was stolen. More seriously, the triangulation marker newly built by the Yellow River Surveying Team in a certain place in Shicun, Qian County, was damaged or stolen after being used only once. In addition, some areas dug out the leveling points, azimuth points, and other markers buried underground and threw them aside, and some people even took them home to use as round tables. This not only causes economic losses to our country and people, but more importantly, affects the accuracy of the nation's geodetic surveying. As our country enters a stage of large-scale economic construction, I believe this is a very important issue that deserves attention. Therefore, I suggest that relevant professional departments carry out extensive publicity before and after carrying out this work, and that each surveying team should also sign contracts with the local district, township, and village governments to protect the buildings in accordance with regulations. At the same time, Party committees and governments at all levels should also explain the important significance of protecting geodetic surveying buildings at meetings of cadres and the masses at all levels, and take effective measures to enable the masses to consciously protect surveying buildings from damage.

    Editor's Note

    Editor's Note: Comrade Zhang Guowei's opinion is correct. The establishment of surveying landmarks has important significance for national construction. Not only does the engineering design and construction of the Yellow River governance project rely on it, but also railway, highway transportation, mine development, national defense construction, and all other engineering construction must rely on it for design and construction. Leading organs in various places must educate the people to attach importance to and protect surveying buildings, and prevent the occurrence of damage to surveying buildings.

### 人人都要保护测量建筑物

　　人人都要保护测量建筑物编辑同志：
    随着国家社会主义建设的开展，大地测量工作已在全国展开，有关测量工作的一些基本建设，如在大地上建筑的各种钢标、木标（即四公尺至数十公尺高的钢塔、木塔，每座价值多在数百万元至二千万元以上）及地下埋设的三角点、水准点、方位点等标石（系混凝土及钢心铸成的），不仅是我国当前进行各种建设的重要指标与重要资料，而且是国家和人民世世代代的珍贵的财产，每块标石都可供我们使用参考数百年，但是由于各地党和政府对群众宣传教育不够，业务部门又交代得不清楚，不少群众对于大地测量工作的意义不够了解，以致各测区的测量建筑物不能得到很好的保护，甚至遭到严重破坏。今年八月中旬我随黄河水利委员会测量工作检查组赴河南西部、山西西南部和陕西关中进行检查，在一个队的测区即发现破坏测量建筑物的事件数起。如今年七月上旬陕西省大荔县草滩乡草滩村群众，把黄河测量队选点组新建三角点上的旗子、竹杆等东西完全拔去；今春陕西淳化县凤凰山二等三角点新埋的标石被人砸坏，钢心被偷跑；更严重的是黄河测量队在乾县史村某地新建的三角标，建好只用了一次，三角标上的楼门、橹柱上的绳子和帆布等物就被破坏或偷跑了。另外还有的地区把藏在地下的水准点、方位点等标石，扒出来扔在一边，还有的群众拉回家去当圆桌。这不仅给我国家人民在经济上造成损失，更重要的是影响国家大地测量的精确。在我国进入大规模经济建设的今天，我认为这是一个十分值得重视的问题。因此我建议有关业务部门在进行此项工作前后进行广泛宣传，各测量队并应按照规定与当地区、乡、村政府订立保护建筑物的合同。同时，各级党委和政府也应在各级干部群众会上讲明保护大地测量建筑物的重要意义，并采取有效措施，使群众能自觉地保护测量建筑物不受损坏。

    编者按
    编者按：张国维同志的意见是正确的。测量标志建筑物的设置对于国家建设有重要的意义。不但治理黄河的工程设计施工要依靠它，就是铁路公路交通运输、矿山开发、国防建设等等一切工程建设都要依凭它来进行设计施工。各地领导机关必须教育人民群众重视和保护测量建筑物，预防破坏测量建筑物的事情发生。
