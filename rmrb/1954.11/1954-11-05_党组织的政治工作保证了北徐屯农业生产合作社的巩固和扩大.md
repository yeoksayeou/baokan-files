The Political Work of the Party Organization Guaranteed the Consolidation and Expansion of the North Xutun Agricultural Production Cooperative
Wang Gengxi

    The North Xutun Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yanggao County, Shanxi Province, has been established for two years. The output of this cooperative has increased every year. In the first year, the average yield per mu was 124 jin, 14 jin more than the best mutual aid team in the village, and 24 jin more than individual farmers. In the second year, the average yield per mu of the agricultural production cooperative increased by 47.4% compared to the first year, and the output of the mutual aid teams and individual farmers fell even further behind. Many farmers, seeing that the agricultural production cooperative's production increased so much and so quickly, were very envious. Many mutual aid teams set up their frameworks early in preparation for joining the cooperative. Last winter, the Party's general task during the transition period was publicized, and the farmers were even more enlightened than before. They all wanted to take the socialist road. Out of the 300 or so households in the village, more than 200 registered to join the cooperative. When the old cooperative members saw so many households wanting to join, they began to grumble: "Our 41 households have just gotten things going. If they all come in, won't that be taking advantage of us?" Cooperative members Xu Sheng and Cao Pigui both shouted: "If they want to join the cooperative, let them form another cooperative. We 41 households will see this through to the end." The farmers who wanted to join felt discouraged when they heard these words, and some said: "Otherwise, let's form another cooperative. There's nothing we can do if they don't want us."

    Correcting the "Closed Door" Ideology of Old Cooperative Members

    As soon as the North Xutun branch of the Communist Party discovered that the old cooperative members' mood was wrong, they quickly held a meeting to study the situation. The branch analyzed that the main reason why the old cooperative members had a "closed door" ideology was that they did not recognize the benefits of expanding the cooperative. Therefore, the branch explained to the old cooperative members that the socialist road is the road to prosperity for everyone, and that it is impossible to reach socialism by relying on only a few people. The branch used practical examples to make everyone realize that as long as it is in line with the actual situation and the agricultural production cooperative is appropriately expanded, the cooperative will be larger and stronger, which will be more beneficial to the development of production. In the first year, when the cooperative was just established, there were only six households. During the busy farming season, they could not attend to everything, and production was greatly limited. That year, only 13 mu of land was improved in terms of basic agricultural construction. In the second year, the cooperative expanded from six households to 41 households. With more people, it was easier to mobilize them, and the division of labor was more detailed and reasonable. In addition to completing agricultural production according to plan that year, they also improved more than 170 mu of land. From the facts, the old cooperative members realized that it was better to have a large cooperative and that the "closed door" ideology was undesirable.

    After the old cooperative members' thinking was straightened out, the agricultural production cooperative smoothly expanded from 41 households to 161 households.

    Correcting the Attitude of New Cooperative Members Towards Joining

    Most of the new cooperative members joined because they recognized the benefits of taking the socialist road, but some new cooperative members did not have a very correct ideological motivation for joining the cooperative. Take Zhao Yincheng for example. His family life was relatively difficult, and he was not very strong. He calculated that joining the cooperative would give him someone to "rely on", so that the cooperative could provide relief to him when he had no other way to make a living. Another type of person, such as Xu Zhanjun and Xu Ting, wanted to entrust their land to the cooperative and go out to work as laborers. There were also a small number of middle peasants with better production conditions who were not wholeheartedly seeking to join the cooperative, but joined because they saw that everyone else was joining and were afraid that others would say they were backward if they stayed outside the cooperative.

    The branch analyzed the ideological situation of the new cooperative members and conducted education tailored to the different ideologies.

    For those who had a dependent mentality about joining the cooperative, the branch focused on conducting education on the glory of labor, explaining that after joining the cooperative, they should work hard and not rely on the cooperative to support them. After this was said, those with a dependent mentality became somewhat discouraged, thinking: "My labor is not good, and the land is poor, and I can't count on the cooperative. How will I live?" Later, the branch used the example of old cooperative member Xu Pu to educate them. Xu Pu was also a poor household before joining the cooperative and also had tuberculosis. After joining the cooperative, the cooperative assigned him appropriate work according to his physical strength. Last year, he worked more than 170 labor days and distributed more than 17 shi of grain, which was more than 6 shi more than his income before joining the cooperative. Zhao Yincheng, who had a dependent mentality, felt relieved when he heard this, saying: "If I can get more grain like Xu Pu after joining the cooperative, I can definitely catch up with him. I have been a laborer since I was a child, so I am not afraid of labor."

    For those cooperative members who wanted to entrust their land to the cooperative and go out to work as laborers, the branch focused on explaining to them the importance of doing a good job in agricultural production, and ordered Vice-Chairman Yang Qi (a Communist Party member) to straighten out their thinking. Yang Qi approached these people and said to them: "Of course, it is good to be a worker, but it is not bad to be a farmer! If the country wants to achieve industrialization, it cannot do without agriculture. Workers and farmers must work hard to achieve socialism." After he said this, some people had nothing to say on the surface, but they still couldn't understand it and still felt that they could earn more money as workers. Yang Qi then used the fact that the cooperative's production had increased year after year to educate them, explaining that as long as they worked hard to do a good job in agricultural production, their income would increase year by year. At the same time, the cooperative management committee announced to everyone that if the state needed workers, the cooperative could uniformly draw them. In this way, those who originally planned to go out to work as laborers settled down in the cooperative.

    For middle peasants with unstable thinking, the branch focused on conducting education on the prospects of socialism, and through examples, explained that middle peasants not only do not suffer losses by joining the cooperative, but can also become prosperous together with everyone. For example, old cooperative member Xu Sheng, who was an old middle peasant, had an annual income of 31 shi of grain before joining the cooperative, but after joining the cooperative, his income was 37 shi. In this way, the middle peasants were relieved.

    Correctly Resolving Contradictions Between New and Old Cooperative Members

    The cooperative originally had more than 21 million yuan of public property (most of which belonged to share capital), which was about 460,000 yuan per labor force. After the expansion of the cooperative, the old cooperative members required the new cooperative members to make up the share capital equally according to the labor force. Some of the new cooperative members who could afford to make up the difference said: "If everyone makes it up, we will make it up too." Those who could not afford to make it up said: "Where can we get so much money? If we can't afford to join the cooperative, we can only not join."

    A contradiction arose between the new and old cooperative members on this issue.

    After studying this issue, the Party branch assisted the cooperative management committee in convening a meeting of representatives of new and old cooperative members to discuss it. Old cooperative member Xu Zhanxiang, whose family life was relatively difficult, advocated dividing the original public property among the old cooperative members. He said: "In this way, we can solve our difficulties, and the new cooperative members will not have to make up the share capital. Isn't this a win-win situation?" Xu Sheng, who did not have any difficulties at home, advocated counting the old cooperative's public property as the old cooperative members' investment. The new cooperative members neither agreed to divide the public property among the old cooperative members nor to count it as the old cooperative members' investment. Xu Xinglong, a representative of the new cooperative members, said: "If the old cooperative members divide the public property, the cooperative will be empty and there will be no foundation for production. If it is counted as the old cooperative members' investment, the new cooperative members will not have enough to give to the old cooperative members even if they work for a year." However, some people could not afford to pay the share capital if the new cooperative members were asked to pay it. At this time, the branch secretary put forward the branch's method of making up the share capital for everyone to discuss. The branch's opinion was: new cooperative members who join the cooperative should make up the full amount if they can afford to; those who cannot afford to make it up temporarily should make it up later; those who have relatively difficult lives should make up less as appropriate; and those who are particularly difficult can not make it up. After this method was put forward, everyone discussed it and agreed that those who could afford to make up the full amount should make it up, and those who could not afford to make it up temporarily should make it up later, but they could not understand the two methods of making up less and not making up at all. Old cooperative member Ma Hong said: "It is still okay to make up the difference slowly later if you cannot afford to make it up temporarily, but isn't it cheaper for the poor households if you make up less or simply don't make up at all?" Xu Zhanyou, a new cooperative member who could afford to make it up, said: "If we want to make it up, we will all make it up. If we don't want to make it up, we don't have to make it up. We are all new cooperative members, so how can we treat them differently?" The new cooperative members who could not afford to make it up were silent.

    The problem was stuck like this.

    The branch analyzed this situation and believed that the main reason was that some people did not understand the significance of absorbing poor households into the cooperative. In order to solve this problem, the branch organized everyone to study the newspaper article "The Datong Chenjiazhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative Leads Poor Households on the Road to Common Prosperity" and encouraged everyone to discuss it in connection with reality. During the discussion, everyone realized that it is beneficial to the cooperative and to the development of production to absorb poor households into the cooperative. Old cooperative member Xu Xingli said: "In order to achieve common prosperity and take the socialist road, we cannot be so strict with the poor households. If the new and old cooperative members are united, we can run the cooperative well." Among the new cooperative members, some who originally insisted on making up the share capital together also changed their attitude at this time, saying that if we can afford to make it up, we will make it up. If the poor households cannot afford to make it up, we cannot force them to make it up. Finally, the branch's opinion was unanimously adopted. Among the new cooperative members, there were 143 labor forces in total, of which 64 made up the full amount at one time, 50 made it up in installments, 24 made up part of it, and 5 did not make it up.

    Both the new and old cooperative members were satisfied with this treatment, and the poor households were even more grateful. Zhao Yincheng said: "The cooperative takes such good care of us, and I will definitely work hard and play a exemplary role in the cooperative."

    Struggling Against Capitalist Ideology

    During the expansion of the cooperative, three rich peasant households mixed into the cooperative due to lax review. After these people entered the cooperative, they spread capitalist ideology among the cooperative members, disrupted the cooperative's discipline, and damaged the cooperative's public property. For example, Zhao Piguang did not participate in agricultural labor in the cooperative, but specialized in selling pigs and engaging in speculative business. Under their inducement, some cooperative members also followed suit. Cooperative member Xu Da saw that it was more profitable to sell pigs than to work in the cooperative, so he wanted to sell pigs. Party member Ma Zhanlu also secretly sold two trips of pigs. As a result, the cooperative members' thoughts were shaken, and some said: "We are planting land for others, and they are going out to do business. All the good things belong to them."

    In order to overcome the capitalist ideology among the cooperative members, the Party branch first criticized Ma Zhanlu's thinking within the Party. Branch Secretary Xu Zhuo criticized him, saying: "We Communist Party members are the leaders of the masses and must lead the masses on the socialist road. You secretly went to sell pigs without the approval of the cooperative. How can this be something that a Communist Party member does!" Ma Hong also criticized him, saying: "The masses are watching us for everything. If you don't lead everyone on the right path, but instead engage in speculative business, how can you be worthy of the Party and the masses?" Ma Zhanlu accepted everyone's criticism, examined his mistakes, and promised that he would never make such mistakes again and that he would unite everyone to run the cooperative well.

    After criticizing Ma Zhanlu's capitalist ideology within the Party, education on the two roads of socialism and capitalism was then carried out among the cooperative members. The branch educated the cooperative members through the comparative education of the Ma Yun and Ma Cun brothers, so that they realized that only by wholeheartedly taking the socialist road can they live a truly happy life. Originally, Ma Yun and Ma Cun both joined the cooperative last spring. After joining the cooperative, Ma Yun felt that his production conditions were better and was afraid of suffering losses, so he followed the rich middle peasant Zhao Zhanfu and withdrew from the cooperative. Although Ma Cun's production conditions were not as good as Ma Yun's, he worked very hard in the cooperative. After the autumn harvest, a comparison between the two brothers showed the difference! Ma Yun had more than 60 mu of land, four labor forces, and two animal forces, and after a year of hard work, he harvested 38 shi of grain. Ma Cun had more than 40 mu of land, two labor forces, and no livestock, and after a year, he distributed more than 40 shi of grain in the cooperative. After comparison, Ma Yun regretted it and complained that he should not have listened to Zhao Zhanfu and left the cooperative, and he rejoined the cooperative.

    After the comparative education of the two roads, the thoughts of the cooperative members were raised a step further. Xu Shengkuan said: "Other roads are not for us farmers to take. Only by taking the socialist road is the right path." Xu Shengde, who originally planned to sell clay pots, also stopped selling them.

    While carrying out education on the two roads, the rich peasant elements were cleaned out of the cooperative, and the cooperative members' thoughts became clearer. They all said: those people are not of one heart with us at all. By cleaning them out, we will take the socialist road more steadily.

    党组织的政治工作保证了北徐屯农业生产合作社的巩固和扩大
    王耕溪
    山西阳高县北徐屯农业生产合作社成立两年了。这个社每年都增加了产量。头一年，每亩平均产量一百二十四斤，比本村顶好的互助组每亩多收十四斤，比单干户每亩多收二十四斤；第二年，农业生产合作社每亩平均产量比头一年又增加了百分之四十七点四，互助组和单干农民的产量就越发赶不上了。好些农民看到农业生产合作社的生产增加得这么多这么快，都很羡慕，许多互助组都早早儿搭架子，准备入社。去年冬天宣传了党在过渡时期的总任务，农民的心眼里比以前更亮了，都要走社会主义道路，全村三百来户，就有二百多户报名入社。老社员们一看这么多户都要入社，心里便嘀咕起来：咱们这四十一户刚闹的像个样儿啦，他们都进来，这不是占了咱们的便宜吗？社员徐生、曹丕贵都嚷着说：“他们愿入社，叫他们另成个社吧，咱这四十一户要办到底。”要求入社的农民，听到这些话，心里便凉了半截，有些人说：“要不咱就另成个社吧，人家不要咱，有啥办法呢？”
    纠正老社员的“关门”思想
    中共北徐屯支部一发现老社员的情绪不对头，就赶快开会研究。支部分析老社员所以产生“关门”思想，主要是没认识扩大社的好处。因此支部向老社员说明，社会主义道路，是大家富裕的道路，只靠少数人干是到不了社会主义的。支部用实际例子，使大家认识：只要切合实际情况，适当地扩大农业生产合作社，社大了、力量更大，对发展生产就更有好处；头一年社刚建起来，只有六户，农忙时，顾东顾不了西，生产受了很大限制。那年，在农业基本建设上，总共才改良了十三亩地的土壤。第二年，社由六户扩大到四十一户，人多了，干活好调动开，分工比较细密、合理。这一年除按计划完成了农业生产，还改良了一百七十多亩地的土壤。从事实中，老社员认识了还是社大有好处，“关门”思想是要不得的。
    老社员思想打通以后，农业生产合作社便顺利地由四十一户扩大到一百六十一户。
    端正新社员的入社态度
    大部分新社员是因为认识到走社会主义道路的好处才入社的，可是也有些新社员，入社的思想动机还不大正确。拿赵银成来说，家庭生活比较困难，自己身体也不大结实，他盘算着入了社有个“靠头”，生活没办法的时候，好让社里来救济他。另有一种人，如徐占俊、徐挺等，是想把土地靠给社里，自己出外当工人。还有少数生产条件比较好的中农，并不是一心一意地要求入社，只是看到大伙都入，怕留在社外别人说落后，才入了社的。
    支部分析了新社员的这些思想情况、针对各种不同思想，分别进行了教育。
    对入社有依赖思想的人，支部着重进行了劳动光荣的教育，说明入了社，更应该好好劳动，不能依赖社来养活。这一说，那些有依赖思想的人又有些泄气，心想：自己劳力不行，土地又差，社里又指望不上，日子怎么过呢？后来，支部又拿老社员徐璞作例子来教育他们。徐璞入社以前也是个困难户，还有痨病；入社以后，社里根据他的体力，给他分配适当的活儿干。去年一年，他做了一百七十多个劳动日，分了十七石多粮食，比他入社以前多收入六石。有依赖思想的赵银成听到这话，心里踏实了，他说：“照徐璞那样入了社还能多分粮食，我也满能赶上他，咱自小就是劳动人，还能怕劳动？”
    对那些想把土地靠给社里、自己出外头当工人的社员，支部着重向他们讲解了搞好农业生产的重要性，并责成副社长杨启（共产党员）来打通这些人的思想。杨启找上这些人，给他们说：“当工人当然好，可是当农民也不坏呀！国家要实现工业化，离了农业就不行，工人农民都好好干，才能实现社会主义。”他这么说了以后，有些人表面上没话说了，实际上还想不通，还是觉得当工人能多挣钱。杨启又拿社里连年增产的事实来教育他们，说明只要努力搞好农业生产，收入就会一年比一年增加。同时，社务委员会又给大家宣布了，如果国家需要工人，可由社里统一抽调。这样，原来打算出外头当工人的人，在社里才安下心来。
    对于思想不大坚定的中农，支部着重进行了社会主义前途教育，并通过实例，说明中农入了社不但不吃亏，而且可以和大家一同富裕。如老社员徐生，是个老中农，没入社以前，每年收入三十一石粮食，入了社，收入三十七石。这样，中农才放心了。
    正确解决新老社员间的矛盾
    社里原来有两千一百多万元的公共财产（其中大部属股份金），每个劳力约合四十六万元左右。社扩大以后，老社员要求新社员把股份金按劳力一律补齐。新社员里有些能补起的户说：“大家都补咱也补。”补不起的户说：“咱去那里弄这么些钱？进不起社只有不进。”
    新老社员在这个问题上发生了矛盾。
    党支部研究了这个问题以后，就协助社务委员会召开新老社员代表会来讨论。老社员徐占相，家庭生活比较困难，主张把原来的公共财产给老社员分了。他说：“这样，一来好解决咱的困难，二来新社员进来也不用再补股份金了。不是两全俱美吗？”家里没困难的徐生，主张把老社的公共财产算成老社员的投资。新社员既不同意老社员把公共财产分了，也不同意算成老社员的投资。新社员代表徐兴隆说：“老社员把公共财产一分，社里底空啦，生产没底垫；要是算成老社员的投资，新社员进社干一年，还不够给老社员哩。”可是，叫新社员补股份金，又有些人补不起。这时，支部书记就把支部研究的补股份金办法提出来，让大家讨论。支部的意见是：入社的新社员，能补起的就补齐；暂时补不起的，缓期补；生活上比较困难的，酌情少补；特别困难的户，可以不补。这个办法提出来以后，大家一讨论，对于能补起的就补齐，暂时补不起的缓期补，都表示同意，就是对少补和不补的两种办法弄不通。老社员马宏说：“暂时补不起，以后慢慢补倒还可以，要是少补，或者干脆不补，那不是便宜了困难户吗？”能补起的新社员徐占有说：“要补，咱都补，要不补，就都不用补，同是个新社员，还能两样看待？”补不起的新社员一声不响。
    问题就这样卡住了。
    支部分析了这个情况，认为主要是有些人对吸收困难户入社的意义还不大明白。为了解决这个问题，支部就组织大家学习了报纸上登的“大同陈家庄农业生产合作社带领困难户走上了共同富裕的道路”，并启发大家联系实际开展了讨论。讨论中，大家认识到，吸收困难户入社，对社对发展生产都有好处。老社员徐兴礼说：“为了共同富裕，走社会主义道路，咱就不能对困难户卡的那么紧，新老社员团结好，咱才能把社办好。”新社员中，有些原来死啃住一齐补股份金的，这时也改变了态度，都说，咱能补起咱就补，困难户补不起，咱也不能硬逼。最后一致通过了支部的意见，入社新社员共劳力一百四十三个，其中有六十四个一次补齐，有五十个分期补，二十四个补一部分，五个不补。
    这样处理以后，新老社员都满意，困难户更是感激不尽。赵银成说：“社里这样照顾咱，我一定要好好干活、在社里起模范作用。”
    向资本主义思想作斗争
    在扩大社时，因为审查不严，有三户富农混进社来。这些人进社以后，在社员中散布资本主义思想，破坏社的纪律，损害社的公共财物。如赵丕光，在社不参加农业劳动，专门贩猪搞投机生意。在他们引诱下，有些社员也跟着学起来。社员徐达看到在社干活不如贩猪利大，就要去贩猪。党员马占禄也偷偷贩了两趟猪。这么一来，社员们的思想都动荡起来，有的说：“咱给人家种着地，人家出外头搞买卖，好事都是人家的。”
    为了克服社员中的资本主义思想，党支部首先在党内对马占禄的思想开展了批评。支部书记徐卓批评他说：“我们共产党员是群众的引路人，必须带领群众走社会主义道路，你不经社里批准，偷偷去贩猪，这那像共产党员干的事！”马宏也批评他说：“群众干啥都是看我们，你不带领大家走正路，反倒搞起投机生意来，你怎能对得起党，对得起群众？”马占禄接受了大家的批评，检讨了自己的错误，并保证往后不再犯这样的错误，一定要团结大家，把社搞好。
    党内批评了马占禄的资本主义思想后，接着又在社员中进行了社会主义和资本主义两条道路的教育。支部通过马云和马存弟兄两个的对比教育社员，使他们认识：只有一心一意地走社会主义道路，才能过真正幸福的生活。原来，马云和马存都在去年春天入了社。入社以后，马云觉着自己的生产条件比较好、怕吃亏，就跟着富裕中农赵占福退了社。马存的生产条件虽不如马云，可是在社里干得挺有劲。收罢秋，弟兄俩一比较，高低显出来了！马云六十来亩地、四个劳动力，两个畜力，紧闹腾了一年，收了三十八石粮食；马存四十来亩地，两个劳动力，没牲畜，一年下来，在社里分了四十多石粮食。经过比较，马云后悔了，怨自己不该听上赵占福的话出了社，又重新入了社。
    经过两条道路的对比教育，社员们的思想都提高了一步，徐生宽说：“别的路都不是咱农民走的，只有走社会主义的道路，才是正路。”徐生德原来打算着去贩瓦盆，也不贩了。
    在进行两条道路教育的同时，把富农分子清洗出社，社员们的思想更加明亮起来，都说：那些人跟咱根本不是一条心，把他们清洗出去，咱走社会主义道路就走得更稳了。
