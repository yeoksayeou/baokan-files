Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, November 2nd: Hebei Province is about to fully launch the unified purchase and supply of grain and oil and the unified purchase of cotton. The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party emphasized at an enlarged cadre meeting: Agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation is the central task of winter work. The province must complete the above-mentioned unified purchase and supply tasks while doing a good job in winter production, establishing agricultural production cooperatives, and conducting production disaster relief in some areas. All localities should use no less strength than they did during last year's unified purchase and supply of grain to complete this year's arduous task.

Currently, counties across the province are convening three-level cadre meetings at the county, district, and township levels, and will also convene meetings of people's representatives at the county and township levels to make specific arrangements. Ten work teams composed of more than 300 cadres have gone to nine regions and one key county (Shunyi County) in the province to assist in carrying out various tasks. Counties and districts will also uniformly organize work teams to go to various townships for specific assistance and guidance. State-owned commercial enterprises, cooperatives, the People's Bank of China, and transportation departments at all levels will also cooperate in supplying materials, developing savings deposits, withdrawing currency from circulation, and managing the market under the unified leadership of Party committees and governments at all levels.

According to the planned steps, propaganda and mobilization work will be widely launched in various parts of the province in early November. At present, various localities are organizing propaganda teams in conjunction with the three-level cadre meetings. The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has issued instructions requiring all localities to create a mass movement for winter production, participation in mutual aid and cooperative organizations, and selling grain, cotton, and oil through in-depth propaganda work.

Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, November 2nd: The Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative, a well-known cooperative in Hebei Province, has achieved a bumper harvest of autumn crops. Most of the crops have now been harvested and brought home, and they are distributing them while successively handing over surplus grain, oil, and cotton to the state in accordance with the pre-purchase contracts signed with the state.

Of the more than 4,250 mu of autumn fields cultivated by the cooperative this year, most of them have completed or exceeded the contracted output plan, except for some crops that experienced slight yield reductions due to excessive rain. The more than 1,100 mu of late corn had a contracted output of 187.5 jin per mu, and the actual harvest was 220 jin; the more than 370 mu of cotton is estimated to exceed the contracted output of 40 jin of seed cotton per mu; the more than 900 mu of peanuts had a contracted output of 300 jin per mu, and the actual harvest may reach 350 jin. The total autumn output of the cooperative is estimated to be more than 1.6 million jin, converted to grain, with an average yield of 390 jin per mu, which is about 30% higher than that of ordinary farmers in the area. Due to the increased output, the income per labor day has increased from 5 jin 12 liang last year to 11 jin 14 liang this year. Therefore, the income of cooperative members has generally increased.

The cooperative has already sold the first batch of more than 10,000 jin of cotton and nearly 10,000 jin of grain to the state. The middle-season cotton is now blooming in more than 300 mu of cotton fields, and it is estimated that the cooperative will contribute 50,000 to 60,000 jin of seed cotton to the textile industry this year. The more than 900 mu of peanuts with full pods are starting to be sold. In addition to reserving seeds and food for the cooperative members, the cooperative can sell more than 200,000 jin of oil crops such as peanuts and sesame to the state this year. They are also preparing to sell more surplus grain to the state than last year and are currently calculating the actual grain output.

    河北省全面布置统购统销工作
    耿长锁农业合作社按照合同出售粮棉油料
    【新华社保定二日电】河北省将要全面展开粮食、油料统购统销和棉花统购工作。中共河北省委在扩大干部会议上强调指出：农业生产互助合作是冬季工作的中心，全省必须在做好冬季生产、建立农业生产合作社工作和部分地区的生产救灾工作中完成上述统购统销任务。各地要以不少于去年粮食统购统销时的力量来完成今年这项繁重任务。
    目前，全省各县正在召开县、区、乡三级干部会议，并将召开县和乡的人民代表大会会议，进行具体布置。由三百多个干部组成的十个工作队，已分别到全省九个专区和一个重点县（顺义县）协助进行各项工作。各个县、区也将统一组织工作队，到各乡进行具体帮助和指导。各级国营商业、合作社、人民银行和交通运输等部门，也将在各级党委和政府统一领导下，配合进行物资供应、开展储蓄存款、回笼货币及市场管理等工作。
    按照预定步骤，全省各地在十一月上旬就要普遍展开宣传动员工作。目前，各地正结合三级干部会议组织宣传队伍。中共河北省委已发出指示，要求各地通过深入的宣传工作，造成群众性的冬季生产、参加互助合作组织和售粮、售棉、售油料的运动。
    【新华社保定二日电】河北省著名的耿长锁农业生产合作社秋季作物获得丰收。目前大部作物都已收获到家，正一面进行分配，一面按着和国家订好的预购合同陆续缴售余粮、油料和棉花。
    这个社今年耕种的四千二百五十多亩秋田，除部分作物因雨多稍有减产外，绝大部分能完成或超额完成包工定产计划。一千一百多亩晚玉米每亩定产一百八十七斤半，实收二百二十斤；三百七十多亩棉花，估计每亩高于定产四十多斤籽棉；九百多亩花生每亩定产三百斤，可实收三百五十斤。全社秋季产量总计折谷一百六十多万斤，每亩平均产量三百九十斤，比当地一般农民高百分之三十左右。由于产量提高，今年每个劳动日所得报酬已由去年的五斤十二两增加到十一斤十四两。因此，社员收入普遍增加。
    这个社已把第一批一万多斤棉花和近万斤粮食卖给国家。现在三百多亩棉田的中喷花正在开放，估计今年全社将有五、六万斤籽棉支援纺织工业。九百多亩果实饱满的花生正开始缴售。除留下种籽和社员吃用外，今年全社可有二十多万斤花生、芝麻等油料卖给国家。并准备比去年更多的余粮卖给国家，现正计算实际产粮数量。
