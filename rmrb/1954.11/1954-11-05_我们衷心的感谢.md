    Our Heartfelt Thanks
    Li Hao, Director of Chongqing 507 Power Plant
    When I saw the news in the People's Daily that the Soviet government delegation, on behalf of the Soviet people, gifted machines and equipment to the Chinese people to organize large-scale state-owned grain farms, I immediately thought of the modern and automated 507 power plant that the Soviet government and the Soviet people helped us build. Stalin said, "No capitalist country can give the people's democracies such genuine and technically sophisticated help as the Soviet Union. The point is not only that this assistance is extremely cheap and technically first-rate. The point is, first of all, that this cooperation is based on mutual assistance and a sincere desire to achieve common economic upsurge." Recalling Stalin's words now, they are so warm and heartfelt!
    To help us build such a new type of automated and modern thermal power plant, the Soviet Ministry of Power Stations sent a design team of six experts to Chongqing in the summer of 1950. They extensively collected information on topography, geology, meteorology, hydrology, transportation, and building materials, and helped us analyze and study a series of problems. In order to correctly design the boiler, they even sent coal samples from Chongqing to Moscow for testing. At that time, the information was not very complete, and our technical level was very low, which could not meet the requirements of socialist construction design, causing the Soviet Ministry of Power Stations experts to encounter many difficulties in the design process. In order to ensure that the design of our plant met both the most advanced socialist construction design standards and the principle of using funds most economically, Soviet experts came to Chongqing in 1951 and 1952 to conduct site surveys and hydrological investigations. They studied the power supply situation in Chongqing at that time and the prospects for industrial development, and determined how the new power plant should be connected to the existing power plant to serve industrial construction. The experts worked tirelessly and selflessly in the scorching wilderness. In order to find the correct water level of the Yangtze River and the flow and velocity at different times, the hydrological expert Gormenov not only studied historical records related to the Yangtze River, but also personally directed the establishment of hydrological stations near the plant site, and conducted measurements at various depths dozens of miles upstream and downstream of the Yangtze River. When the drilling expert Morozov was measuring the topography of the plant area, he personally measured every field ridge in order to balance the amount of earth and stone excavated and filled during the design, so that the excavation of earth and stone could be carried out in a planned manner. They contributed decades of experience and provided us with more than 10,000 drawings in a short period of time, completing an extremely arduous task.
    During construction, to ensure full use of the design and equipment's advantages and fully implement the construction principles of "good, fast, economical, and safe," it was necessary to have excellent technical guidance. At the beginning of construction, Soviet expert Pravdin came to the construction site to study and analyze the specific situation, established a comprehensive installation schedule, and solved many key difficulties in the construction process. The experts provided more than 4,700 suggestions. The noble qualities and great internationalist spirit of the Soviet experts responsible for technical guidance at the construction site deeply moved all the employees. The experts worked diligently day and night, giving up holidays, forgetting about illnesses, and strictly demanding quality. The civil engineering expert Konstantinovich suffered from severe gallstone disease and could not go to the site to work. At that time, the turbine foundation was being poured, which had high technical requirements. The expert found the civil engineering technicians, explained the drawings in detail, and solved the problems raised by the technicians. The mechanical expert Gorokhov had a recurrence of heart disease due to overwork and was hospitalized; the doctor did not want him to receive visitors; but at that time, the coal mill was being installed, and some technical problems had to be solved by the expert himself. He was very anxious lying in bed, called the technicians to report, and explained the tasks in detail item by item. The doctor advised him to rest, but he insisted on studying the work to completion.
    When the installation was completed and the machinery and equipment began trial operation, boiler experts Kuznetsov and Studukallo, and turbine experts Shishov and Afanasyev, guided the operation in shifts day and night, even without sleep for two or three days and nights. During operation, experts took turns on duty to control the operation, working about twelve hours a day for two consecutive months. The experts also personally trained our operating workers, often gave lectures to the workers to answer questions, and also, in conjunction with the machinery and equipment and operation of our plant, helped us formulate 48 operating procedures and the organizational structure responsibilities of the plant. In order to achieve convenient and economical operation, the experts also put forward more than 600 suggestions during operation.
    In order to put all the automatic control equipment into normal operation, the Soviet experts worked day and night to carry out adjustment and testing work. They put forward many valuable suggestions. After these suggestions were implemented, the reliability of equipment automation and the economy of combustion were greatly improved. Based on the idea of resolutely implementing expert suggestions, all employees, under the condition of safe operation, ensured that the steam consumption per kilowatt-hour reached the Soviet design standard, and accumulated more wealth for the country's socialist industrialization.
    Now, when we look at the chimneys towering into the clouds with plumes of silvery-gray smoke, and see the workers in the workshops who have gone from unskilled novices to basically mastering this new type of automated equipment, how excited we are! We will always remember the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people, remember the people educated by Stalin, and express our heartfelt thanks: We will improve production to ensure safe power generation, and manage this new type of automated power plant well to repay the assistance of the Soviet government and the Soviet people, and to repay the sincere technical guidance of the Soviet experts. Let us always follow the Soviet path forward!

    我们衷心的感谢
    重庆五○七发电厂厂长  李浩
    我看到人民日报刊载苏联政府代表团代表苏联人民赠送机器和设备给中国人民以组织大型国营谷物农场的消息，立刻联想到苏联政府和苏联人民帮助我们建成的现代化自动化的五○七电力厂。斯大林说过：“没有一个资本主义国家能像苏联那样给予各人民民主国家以真正的帮助和技术精湛的帮助。问题不仅在于这种帮助是极度便宜的，技术上是头等的。问题首先在于这种合作的基础，是互相帮助和求得共同经济高涨的真诚愿望。”现在想起斯大林的话，是多么的亲切啊！
    为了帮助我们建设这样一个新型的自动化现代化的火力发电厂，苏联政府电站部在一九五○年夏天就派了一个包括六个专家的设计组到重庆来，广泛地收集了地形、地质、气象、水文、交通、建筑材料等情况，帮助我们分析研究了一系列的问题。为了正确地进行锅炉设计，还将重庆的煤样寄到莫斯科去化验。当时资料不很完整，我们的技术水平很低，不能满足社会主义建设设计的要求，使苏联电站部的一些专家们在设计中遇到了许多困难。为了使我们这个厂设计的既合乎最先进的社会主义建设设计标准，又合乎最经济地使用资金的原则，苏联专家又在一九五一年和一九五二年来重庆进行了厂址探测和水文调查，研究了重庆当时电力的供应情况和工业发展前途，确定了新电厂如何同原有电厂联结起来为工业建设服务。专家们不辞劳苦地在炎热的荒野上忘我地工作着。水文专家哥尔门诺夫为了找到正确的长江水位和各个不同时期的流量、流速等材料，不仅研究了有关长江的历史记录资料，还亲自指导在厂址附近设立水文站，在长江上下游数十里各种不同的深度中进行测量。钻探专家莫洛佐夫在测量厂区的地形时，每一根田坎都亲自测量，以便在设计时平衡土石方挖填数量，使开挖土石方的工程有计划地进行。他们把数十年的经验都贡献出来，在短短的时间内就供给了我们一万多张图纸，完成了一件异常繁重的工作。
    在施工的时候，要保证充分利用设计和设备的优越性，全面地贯彻“好、快、省、安全”的施工原则，就必须要有优越的技术指导。施工开始的时候，苏联专家普拉夫金来到工地研究分析了具体情况，订出了安装的综合进度计划，解决了施工中很多关键性的困难。单是专家们提出的建议即有四千七百多件。在工地负责技术指导的苏联专家们的崇高品质和伟大的国际主义精神，深深地感动了全体职工。专家们日夜辛勤地工作，放弃了假日，忘记了疾病，严格地要求着质量。土建专家康斯坦丁诺夫患了严重的胆石炎病，不能到现场工作，当时正在浇灌透平机的基础，技术要求较高，专家把土木建筑技术人员找去，给他们详细讲解图纸，解决技术人员提出的问题。机动专家郭若霍夫，因为工作过于疲劳，心脏病复发，住在医院里；医生不要他会客；但当时正安装磨煤机，有些技术问题必须专家亲自解决，他躺在病床上很着急，打电话把技术人员找去汇报，并详细地逐项交代任务，医生劝他休息，他却坚持把工作研究完。
    当安装竣工，机器设备开始试运转的时候，锅炉专家库兹聂错夫、斯都卡都洛夫，透平专家石少夫、阿佛拉西也夫昼夜轮班指导运转，甚至两三昼夜不睡觉。运转中专家轮流值班掌握运行，每天工作大约十二小时，连续有两月之久。专家并亲手培养我们的运行工人，经常为工人上课解答疑问，同时又结合我厂机器设备及运转情况，帮助我们拟定了四十八种运行规程和厂的组织机构职责条例。为达到运转既方便又经济，在运行中专家们又提出了六百多件建议。
    苏联专家们为了使自动控制设备全部正常地投入运转，曾经夜以继日地进行着调整和试验工作。他们提出许多宝贵的建议。这些建议经执行后，大大提高了设备自动化的可靠性和燃烧的经济性。全体职工在坚决执行专家建议的思想基础上，在安全运行的条件下，保证了每度电的蒸汽消耗量达到苏联的设计标准，为国家社会主义工业化积累了更多的财富。
    现在当我们望着耸立云霄的烟囱冒着银灰色浓烟，看着车间的工人由不熟练的生手到能基本上掌握这新型自动化的设备，我们的感情是多么的激动啊！我们永远怀念着中苏两国人民的友谊，怀念着斯大林教养的人们，倾诉着我们衷心的感谢：我们以搞好生产保证安全发电，管理好这座新型的自动化发电厂来答谢苏联政府和苏联人民的援助，答谢苏联专家们的真诚的技术指导，让我们永远遵循着苏联的道路前进！
