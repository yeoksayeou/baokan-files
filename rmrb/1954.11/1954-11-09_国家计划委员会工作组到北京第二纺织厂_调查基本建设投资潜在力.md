Xinhua News Agency, November 6th—The State Planning Commission recently sent a working group to the state-owned Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, which is under construction, to investigate the potential for investment in basic construction. The investigation concluded that if the construction project of the state-owned Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory could implement savings in all aspects, it could save the state over 50 billion yuan in investment. The experience of this investigation also shows that if relevant departments organize specialized inspection teams to carefully examine the construction of a single enterprise or construction site, and discover and solve more problems, it will be of great significance to the country's construction.

During the investigation, the State Planning Commission working group made specific calculations and studies of the planned and actual usage of materials, labor, management, and machinery procurement and installation expenses for the state-owned Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory project. Taking materials as an example, based on the actual amount used in completed projects and the planned amount needed for unfinished projects, compared with the construction estimate and balanced with actual material inventory, the remaining value of major materials such as wood, steel, cement, pipeline materials, and wires (mainly electrical wires) totaled 32.6 billion yuan. Among them, 5 billion yuan was saved, and 27.6 billion yuan was originally overestimated. In addition, by paying attention to saving on material price differences and transportation costs, another 9 billion yuan in investment can be saved. Taking labor as another example, based on the actual needs of civil engineering construction and the rough estimates of labor required for water and sewage, electrical, heating, and sanitary equipment installation projects, a total of 4.8 billion to 6 billion yuan can also be saved. This is mainly because, through last year's winter training, workers' political consciousness and technical level have been initially improved; on this basis, the construction site adjusted labor organization, promoted advanced experience, launched labor competitions, and implemented time-based bonuses for exceeding quotas; in the second half of this year, the piece-rate wage system was implemented, which further promoted the improvement of labor organization and the promotion of advanced experience, so labor productivity was improved, and labor was saved. In terms of management costs, because the project budget was overestimated and the fee standards for certain items (such as additional wages and low-value consumables) were too high, the amount of work contracted by the original engineering company was larger than last year, and labor productivity improved this year, and less labor was used, so various management costs were correspondingly tightened. It is estimated that the management expenses for the entire project can be reduced by more than 10 billion yuan. In terms of the purchase and installation of textile machinery, it is calculated that there is also a good chance of saving 2 billion yuan in investment.

The investigation concluded that, generally speaking, the state's planned investment in the basic construction of the Beijing State-owned No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory was too high, and the possibility and reality of saving investment were greatly present. The figures used in this investigation are still relatively conservative. If the engineering department can further strengthen the management of material costs, labor costs, and management fees, strengthen leadership over cost accounting, pay attention to saving, and reduce waste, then similar projects in the future can save even more state investment.

    国家计划委员会工作组到北京第二纺织厂
    调查基本建设投资潜在力
    【新华社六日讯】国家计划委员会不久前曾派出工作组，对正在建设中的国营北京第二棉纺织厂作了一次基本建设投资潜在力的调查。调查结果认为，国营北京第二棉纺织厂的建设工程如果从各方面进行节约，可以为国家节省出五百亿元以上的投资。这次调查的经验还说明，有关部门如果组织专门的检查组织认真检查一个企业或一个工地的建设，发现和解决更多的问题，将对国家建设有很大的意义。
    国家计划委员会工作组在调查中，曾对国营北京第二棉纺织厂工程的材料、人工、管理、机械购置和安装等方面费用的计划和使用情况，分别作了具体的计算和研究。拿材料一项来说，根据已完工程的实际需用量和未完工程的计划需要量，同施工概算对比，并和实际库存材料平衡，结果木材、钢筋、水泥、管线材料、线材（主要是电线）等主要材料的结余价值共达三百二十六亿元。其中有五十亿元是节约的，二百七十六亿元是原来多估了的。另外在材料差价和运输费方面注意节约，还可以省出九十亿元的投资。再拿人工来说，根据土木建筑工程的实际需要和上下水道、电气、暖气、卫生设备安装工程所需人工的粗略估算，总共也可节约四十八亿元到六十亿元。这主要是因为经过去年的冬季训练，工人的政治觉悟和技术水平初步提高了；在这一基础上，工地调整劳动组织，推广先进经验，发动劳动竞赛，实行计时超额奖励；今年下半年又实行计件工资制，更促进了劳动组织的改善和先进经验的推行，所以劳动生产率提高了，人工节省了。在管理费用方面，因为工程预算估计过大，某些项目（如附加工资、低值易耗品等）的取费标准偏高，原来的工程公司承包的工作量比去年大，今年的劳动生产率提高，人工用得少了，因此各种管理费用就相应地紧缩下来。计算整个工程管理费用可以节约一百亿元以上。在纺织机械购置和安装方面，据计算也有把握节约二十亿元的投资。
    调查结果认为，总的说来，国家对北京国营第二棉纺织厂基本建设的计划投资额是偏高的，节约投资的可能性和现实性是大大存在的。这次调查采用的数字还是比较保守的，如果工程部门能够进一步加强对材料费、人工费、管理费的管理，抓紧对成本工作的领导，注意节约，减少浪费，那末，今后像这样的工程是还可以节省出更多的国家投资的。
