    The Shanxi Provincial Federation of Trade Unions Convenes Third Congress
    Decides to Vigorously Mobilize Workers to Improve Labor Productivity
    The Shanxi Provincial Federation of Trade Unions held its Third Congress from November 1st to 8th. In order to further implement the resolutions of the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions, the congress, in accordance with the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee, seriously examined and summarized the work of the past five years using the method of criticism and self-criticism.
    The congress first affirmed that over the past five years, the Shanxi Provincial Federation of Trade Unions has achieved certain successes in organizing and educating workers, carrying out technical innovation movements, launching labor competitions, improving labor productivity, overfulfilling national production plans, and improving the welfare of workers on the basis of increased production. The congress also emphasized that the Shanxi Provincial Federation of Trade Unions had at one time neglected leading production and had committed errors of trade unionism and economism to varying degrees. In carrying out labor competitions, many trade union cadres were satisfied with the lively competition forms, did not deeply study the problems in production, or learn production knowledge; they were not good at solving key problems and weak links in production management through competition, relying on the masses, so that labor competitions were not better integrated with improving enterprise management; due to the lack of in-depth political and ideological work, errors of championism occurred in labor competitions. In the technical innovation movement, there was a tendency to not aim at fulfilling national plans, to carry out technical innovation in isolation, to oppose technical innovation to enterprise management and even to labor competition, to be unrealistic and ambitious without starting from the actual situation of the enterprise; to neglect the promotion of advanced experience and the education of workers to learn and master new technologies. In labor insurance work, it was once believed that labor insurance was just a post-event relief work for birth, old age, illness, death, injury, and disability, and they were busy paying insurance money according to regulations, lacking active disease prevention, injury prevention, strengthening the safety responsibility system, and carrying out health campaigns. Secondly, criticisms were also made of the shortcomings existing in the work of female workers and the education of labor models. The congress discussed in detail and resolved that in the future, it is necessary to strengthen trade union construction, widely and deeply mobilize the masses of workers to carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy, carry out the labor competition movement with technical innovation as the basic content, learn and promote advanced experience, organize and educate workers, practice strict economy, oppose waste, improve labor productivity, improve product quality, reduce product costs, strengthen trade union work in capitalist enterprises, and improve the material and cultural life of workers, so as to support the liberation of Taiwan with practical actions.
    The congress elected the Third Executive Committee of the Shanxi Provincial Federation of Trade Unions. (Report from Shanxi Reporter Station of this newspaper)

    山西省工会联合会召开第三届代表大会
    决定大力发动职工提高劳动生产率
    山西省工会联合会从十一月一日至八日召开了第三届代表大会。为进一步贯彻中国工会第七次全国代表大会的决议，大会根据党的四中全会决议的精神，用批评和自我批评的方法，认真地检查和总结了五年来的工作。
    大会首先肯定：五年来山西省工会联合会，在组织和教育工人，开展技术革新运动，开展劳动竞赛，提高劳动生产率，超额完成国家生产计划以及在提高生产的基础上，改善职工福利事业等方面，都取得了一定的成绩。大会并着重指出山西省工会联合会曾一度忽视领导生产，在不同程度上犯过工联主义和经济主义的错误。在开展劳动竞赛中，不少工会干部满足于轰轰烈烈的竞赛形式，没有深入研究生产中的问题，学习生产知识；不善于针对生产管理上的关键问题和薄弱环节，通过竞赛形式，依靠群众加以解决，使劳动竞赛没有更好地和改善企业管理紧密结合；由于政治思想工作不深入，劳动竞赛中曾发生锦标主义的错误。在技术革新运动中，曾发生不以完成国家计划为目标，孤立地进行技术革新，把技术革新和企业管理甚至和劳动竞赛对立起来，不从本企业实际出发，好高骛远；忽视推广先进经验和教育职工学习掌握新技术等不良倾向，在劳动保险工作中，曾认为劳动保险就是生、老、病、死、伤、残的事后救济工作，忙于按条例支付保险金，缺乏积极地防病、防伤，加强安全责任制，开展卫生运动等工作。其次，对女工工作，劳动模范的教育等方面存在的缺点，亦进行了批判。大会详细讨论并决议，今后必须加强工会建设，广泛深入地发动职工群众开展增产节约运动，开展以技术革新为基本内容的劳动竞赛运动，学习和推广先进经验，组织和教育工人，厉行节约，反对浪费，提高劳动生产率，提高产品质量，降低产品成本，加强资本主义企业中的工会工作，改善职工物质、文化生活，以实际行动支援解放台湾。
    大会选举了山西省工会联合会第三届执行委员会。（本报山西记者站）
