To all members of the "Stalin" Collective Farm, dear comrades:

We, all the men and women members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Collective Farm, are welcoming the great 37th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution with joy and excitement. We have also heard the news of the Sino-Soviet Communiqué and the Soviet Union's assistance in establishing large farms in our country. We would like to express our deep gratitude to you, and through you, to all the people of the Soviet Union.

Our Sino-Soviet Friendship Collective Farm was organized in 1952, during the Sino-Soviet Friendship Month, inspired by your shining example. It was formed by 918 peasant households from four villages: Guancun, Nanchui, and others. After the organization, our collective farm's production increased, fully demonstrating the superiority of collective production. The surrounding individual farmers also actively requested to join, so our farm expanded to 1,064 households.

This year, the machine tractor station used Soviet-made combines to help us harvest wheat. The plowing, harrowing, cultivating, and sowing of 14,000 mu of autumn crops were also done using Soviet-made tractors and various agricultural machines, greatly reducing heavy physical labor. We are applying various advanced Soviet production technologies in many aspects. This year's autumn seedlings are lush and even, promising a good harvest.

Machines have saved us a lot of labor, and we have the opportunity to engage in diversified sideline production. This year, we built three pig farms, opened an oil mill and a lime factory, and also organized a year-round manure accumulation team. On the barren mountains, we have planted 500 mu of tree saplings, and around the village, we have transplanted more than 67,000 various trees, and also cultivated 55 mu of apple and grape trees.

Our cultural life has also greatly improved. We have established four libraries with about 1,000 books and periodicals, most of which are popular booklets introducing the Soviet Union. The farm subscribed to 52 copies of the "Sino-Soviet Friendship News" and two copies of the Chinese version of "Soviet Women." In our amateur technical school, 56 men and women members are studying, and 29 young members (including six women) have already learned to drive tractors. We also have three amateur theatrical troupes that regularly perform programs singing about our life and production. Recently, the farm bought two new radios.

Dear comrades! The facts of the past two years have proven to us that following your path and earnestly learning from your advanced experience is the only way for us to fundamentally get rid of poverty. We will learn from you even better. We firmly believe that in the near future, our village will be as beautiful as yours is now; our life will be as happy as yours is now.

With the most cordial brotherly greetings,

All members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Collective Farm, Changzhi County, Shanxi Province

### 中苏友好集体农庄给“斯大林”集体农庄的信

    中苏友好集体农庄给“斯大林”集体农庄的信亲爱的“斯大林”集体农庄全体庄员同志：
    我们中苏友好集体农庄全体男女庄员，正以欢欣鼓舞的心情迎接伟大的十月社会主义革命三十七周年的时候，又听到了中苏会谈公报和苏联帮助我国建立大农场的消息，我们谨向你们，并通过你们向全苏联人民致以深切的感谢。
    我们中苏友好集体农庄，是在你们光辉榜样的启示下，于一九五二年中苏友好月期间，由关村、南垂等四个村庄的九百一十八户农民组织起来的。组织起来以后，我们的集体农庄生产提高了，充分显示了集体生产的优越性，周围的个体农民也都积极要求参加了，于是我们农庄扩大到了一千零六十四户。
    今年，机器拖拉机站用苏联制的联合收割机帮助我们收割小麦，一万四千亩大秋作物的耕、耙、中耕、播种等，也都是用苏联制的拖拉机和各种农业机器来干活的，繁重的体力劳动已经大大减少了。苏联的各项先进生产技术，我们正在多方面运用。今年的秋苗旺盛整齐，可望丰收。
    机器使我们节省了大量的劳动力，我们已有可能来经营多种副业生产了。今年，我们修建了三个养猪场，开了一个榨油厂、一个灰厂，还组织了一个常年积肥队。在光秃的山上，已经种了五百亩树秧，村子周围也移栽了六万七千多棵各种树木，还培植了五十五亩苹果树和葡萄树。
    我们的文化生活也有了很大的提高。我们已经建立了四个图书馆，有书刊一千来册，大部分都是介绍苏联的通俗小册子。农庄里订了五十二份“中苏友好报”和两份中文版的“苏联妇女”。我们的业余技术学校里，有五十六位男女庄员在学习，并已有二十九个青年庄员（其中有六个女庄员）学会了开拖拉机。我们还有三个业余剧团经常演出歌唱我们生活和生产的节目。最近，农庄又新买了两架收音机。
    亲爱的同志们！两年来的事实向我们证明了：走你们的道路，认真学习你们的先进经验，是我们根本摆脱穷困的唯一途径。我们要更好地向你们学习，我们深信：在不久的将来，我们的村庄，一定会像你们现在一样美丽；我们的生活，一定会像你们现在一样幸福。致以最亲切的兄弟般的敬礼
    山西省长治县中苏友好集体农庄全体庄员
