    State-owned Tianjin Cotton Textile Factories Actively Conserve Cotton
    Expected to Save 200,000 Jin of Raw Cotton in the Fourth Quarter
    [Our Newspaper] State-owned Tianjin cotton textile factories have launched a mass movement to conserve cotton. Preliminary estimates suggest that these factories can save more than 200,000 jin of raw cotton in the fourth quarter of this year. This cotton can be used to weave more than 22,000 additional bolts of cloth.
    Since the Tianjin Municipal Member Representative Conference of the Textile Workers' Union of China was held in late October, the factories have initially exposed phenomena of waste of raw cotton through anti-waste exhibitions and employee discussion forums. They have also formulated cotton conservation plans based on specific circumstances. Cotton Mill No. 3, after a relatively detailed analysis and careful accounting, has determined that in the fourth quarter, the amount of cotton used per yarn package will be reduced by 3.771 jin compared to the current actual level. Cotton Mill No. 1 plans to reduce the amount of cotton used per yarn package by 4.22 jin. The planned cotton usage of other factories is also lower than the figures required by the Tianjin Textile Administration Bureau.
    At present, the factory workers have been mobilized and are actively saving cotton in all aspects. The workers in the yarn and cloth workshops of Cotton Mill No. 4 have recently developed more than 30 measures related to saving raw cotton and reducing waste cotton. For example, after adjusting the steel wire machine, each machine can leak 1.4 pounds less cotton per day. After improving the angle of the cotton opener, the employees in the opening and cleaning section quickly reduced the amount of white cotton in the waste cotton from 29.23 percent to 16.33 percent. The workers in the warping department of the first cloth workshop of Cotton Mill No. 1 have improved the method of changing yarn, reducing the waste cotton from three liang to one and a half liang per frame. Luo Xiuxiang, a worker in the C shift group of the third yarn workshop, used to be careless when changing roving, resulting in several bags of roving strips every day, but now this has been reduced to one bag. The workers in Cotton Mills No. 3 and No. 6 are also vigorously saving cotton and have begun to achieve results.

    国营天津各棉纺织厂积极节约用棉
    预计第四季可节约原棉二十万斤
    【本报讯】国营天津各棉纺织厂，展开了群众性的节约用棉工作。根据初步预计，各厂在今年第四季度可节约原棉二十多万斤，用这些棉花可以多织二万二千多匹布。
    自从十月下旬中国纺织工会天津市会员代表会议开过以后，各厂通过反浪费展览会和职工座谈会等，初步揭发了浪费原棉的现象，并根据具体情况制订了节约用棉计划。棉纺三厂经过比较细致的分析和算细账，确定在第四季度把每件纱的用棉量较目前实际水平减少三点七七一斤。棉纺一厂计划将每件纱的用棉量降低四点二二斤。其他各厂计划的用棉量，也都低于天津纺织管理局要求的数字。
    目前，各厂职工已动员起来，积极从各方面节约用棉。棉纺四厂的纱场和布场职工，最近作出了三十多项有关节约原棉和减少回丝的措施。如调整了钢丝机，每天每部钢丝机就可少漏棉花一点四磅；清花工段职工改进了开棉机的角度以后，落棉中的白花很快地就由百分之二十九点二三降低到百分之十六点三三。棉纺一厂一布场整经部门的工人们，已经改进了换纱的办法，使每架纱出的回丝由三唡降低到一点五唡；三纱场丙班一组工人骆秀香，以前换粗纱不仔细，每天出的粗纱条子总有几口袋，现在已减少到一口袋了。棉纺三、六厂的职工，也在大力节约用棉，并开始获得成绩。
