Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 25th:

    Tokyo dispatch: The long-prepared conservative "New Party" of Japanese Prime Minister and President of the ruling Liberal Party, Yoshida's political rivals—the Japan Democratic Party—was formally established in Tokyo on the 24th. The "New Party" announced that its aim is to contend for the position held by the Yoshida faction.
    The main participants in the Japan Democratic Party include the anti-Yoshida group within the Liberal Party, led by Ichiro Hatoyama (mainly about forty members of the Diet), the Progressive Party, and the Japan Liberal Party. The "New Party" elected Ichiro Hatoyama as president and former Progressive Party president, Mamoru Shigemitsu, as vice president. The establishment of the Japan Democratic Party has caused a new division within the camp of conservative parties in the parliament. The "New Party" announced that it currently holds 124 seats in the House of Representatives and anticipates that approximately ten more Diet members will join the "New Party" within days. The formal departure of the Hatoyama group's Diet members from the Liberal Party has reduced the Liberal Party's seats in the House of Representatives to just over 180. To hold a majority of seats in the House of Representatives, it is necessary to have at least 234 members.
    According to the "New Party's" published platform, its positions on major issues such as constitutional revision and rearmament are the same as those of the Liberal Party. However, the "New Party's" platform advocates developing independent diplomacy and establishing normal relations with all countries, with an emphasis on establishing friendly ties and economic cooperation with other Asian countries. The platform also advocates breaking free from the Japanese economy's dependence on American "special procurement" orders and promoting normal foreign trade.
    In order to force Yoshida to step down, the "New Party" announced that it will submit a vote of no confidence against Yoshida at the special session of the Diet to be convened on November 30th. Suzuki Mosaburo and Jotaro Kawakami, leaders of the left and right wings of the Socialist Party, which together hold 133 seats in the House of Representatives, jointly announced on the 24th that the Socialists have decided to support this proposal. At the same time, Japanese newspaper opinion has also been calling for Yoshida to resign. The Liberal Party has been urgently discussing how to deal with the crisis these past few days.

    日本保守“新党”宣布成立
    准备对吉田提出不信任案
   【新华社二十五日讯】东京消息：日本首相、执政的自由党总裁吉田的政敌们筹备已久的保守
  “新党”——日本民主党，二十四日在东京正式成立。“新党”宣布了的目的是争夺吉田派的地位。
    参加日本民主党的主要有以鸠山一郎为首的自由党反吉田集团（主要是四十名左右的国会议员）、改进党和日本自由党。“新党”选出鸠山一郎为总裁，原改进党总裁重光葵为副总裁。日本民主党的成立使议会内保守党派的阵营发生新的分化。“新党”宣布它现在在众议院共拥有一百二十四席，并且预料在日内还将有约十名国会议员参加“新党”。鸠山集团国会议员的正式脱离自由党，使自由党在众议院的议席减少到一百八十多席。要在众议院掌握过半数议席，至少需要拥有二百三十四名众议员。
    根据“新党”发表的政纲，它在修改宪法和重新武装这些重大问题上的主张，和自由党一样。但是“新党”的政纲主张发展独立的外交和同各国建立正常的关系，而着重于同其他亚洲国家建立友好的联系和经济合作。这份政纲并主张解脱日本经济对美国“特需”订货的依赖，促进正常的对外贸易。
    为了迫使吉田让位，“新党”宣布它将在十一月三十日召开的国会特别会议上对吉田提出不信任案。在众议院共拥有一百三十三席的左、右两派社会党的领袖铃木茂三郎和河上丈太郎二十四日共同宣布，社会党人决定支持这种提案。同时，日本报纸舆论也纷纷要求吉田辞职。自由党这几天正在紧张地商讨如何应付危局。
