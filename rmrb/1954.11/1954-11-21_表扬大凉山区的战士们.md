Praising the Warriors of the Liangshan Area

In August, while the vast plains of the motherland still swelter with scorching heat, the primeval forests of the Liangshan area are already filled with swirling snowflakes. The warriors of the Public Security 3048 Detachment participating in the construction of Liangshan, with their fiery hearts, break through the cold's encroachment and transform into a tremendous force! Liu Zhensuo, the deputy platoon leader who has been recognized for eight major and minor military achievements and who participated in the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway and is now actively participating in the construction of Liangshan, said, "If Taiwan is not liberated for even one day, I feel like a thousand-pound stone is pressing on my heart!" – This is also the stone on the hearts of thousands of Liangshan warriors.

The slogan "Actively support the liberation of Taiwan" has been turned into practical action by the warriors. The Eighth Company, which is responsible for logging in the old forest, completes the tasks of two working days in an average of one working day, cutting down 550 huge fir trees from the dense old forest ahead of schedule, and then transporting them from the steep mountains to the construction site. Dai Yuxing, a model squad leader and first-class hero in the suppression of bandits, leads a lime kiln that used to produce only 2,000 catties of lime per kiln. Now, he has increased the output to 80,000 catties per kiln and will soon increase it to 120,000 catties per kiln; moreover, he delivered 280,000 catties of lime from the kiln ahead of schedule.

In the past two years, this unit has unlocked the mystery in people's minds throughout history – opening up the vast central area of ​​Greater and Lesser Liangshan, enabling the Yi people to truly achieve economic emancipation. The warriors built a historically unprecedented horse trail, thousands of miles long, through the Liangshan Mountains, extending directly from Sichuan to Xikang; at the foot of Huangmaogang, the main peak of Greater and Lesser Liangshan, they built the first large building in Liangshan in thousands of years.... In order to accelerate the construction of Liangshan, in September, this unit handed over the fruits of its labor over the past few months – piles of lime, wood, bricks, and tiles – to fraternal units. Braving rain and snow, they crossed the long peaks of Sichuan and Xikang to build the vast northern region!

Marching north is arduous, so arduous that even a path trodden by mountain goats cannot be found. But the warriors bravely and proudly said, "What is this little bit of hardship?" Because the warriors know: we endure hardship so that the Yi people of Liangshan can achieve happiness as soon as possible; building Liangshan well and consolidating the border defense is to support the liberation of Taiwan with practical actions. After a certain company crossed the central Liangshan Mountains, crossed the "Three-in-One Strike" River, and entered Niuniuba, they encountered continuous autumn rains, and the river rose sharply, cutting off the supply of food. Yun Qiliang, a young deputy platoon leader, voluntarily applied to cross the river to find the supporting troops, and unfortunately, our excellent warrior was swept away by the rapid cold current. Comrades wiped away their tears, and with empty stomachs, persisted in carrying out their work.

In the season of heavy snow and wind, the sky and the earth were a vast expanse of white, and even the vigorous ancient pines trembled slightly. But the warriors still opened roads through mountains and built bridges over rivers. No matter how towering the mountains, deep the ravines, or dangerous the valleys, they could not stop the warriors' hearts from advancing. They are always concerned about every major political event in the lives of the people across the country, especially the news about our determination to liberate Taiwan! This news has become the driving force for promoting all work in Liangshan, making the cold Liangshan fiery! Zhou Bangzhen

    表扬大凉山区的战士们
    八月，祖国的广大平原上还有着炙人的暑气，大凉山区的原始森林里就飞舞着漫天雪花。参加建设大凉山的公安三○四八支队的战士们，一个个火热的心冲破了寒冷的侵袭，化成了一股巨大的力量！立过八次大小战功，参加过修筑成渝铁路现在又积极参加建设凉山的副排长刘振锁说：“台湾一天没解放，我心里就像压上了一块千斤石！”——这也是千百个凉山战士们心上的石块。
    “积极支援解放台湾”的口号，变成了战士们的实际行动。在老林担任伐木的八连，平均以一个工作日的时间，完成了两个工作日的任务，提前把五百五十棵巨大的杉松，从密密杂杂的老林砍倒，再从险峻的山上运到工地。剿匪一等功臣、模范班长戴玉兴领导的石灰窑，过去一窑只能出两千斤石灰，现在提高到一窑出八万斤，不久又将提高到一窑能出十二万斤；而且提前使二十八万斤石灰出了窑。
    两年来，这支部队打开了有史以来人们心中的谜——开辟了大小凉山中部广大地区，使彝族人民真正在经济上翻身。战士们建筑了一条历史上从古未有的、长达千里的马道穿过大凉山，由四川直伸向西康；在大小凉山主峰黄茅岗下，建造了大凉山千百年来第一次出现的大楼……。为了加速凉山建设，九月，这支部队把几个月来的劳动成果——堆成山的石灰、木料、砖瓦等交给兄弟部队后，自己又冒着雨雪翻过川康长峰，建设北部广大地区去了！
    向北部进军是艰苦的，艰苦得连一条山羊走过的路也找不着。但是战士们勇敢自豪地说：“这点苦算个啥？”因为战士们知道：我们吃苦，是为了使大凉山的彝族人民早日得到幸福；建设好凉山、巩固了边防，就是以实际行动支援解放台湾。某连穿过大凉山中部，渡过了“三合一打”河，进入扭扭坝后，遇着连绵不断的秋雨，河水陡涨，后援粮食断绝。年青的副排长云起良，自动申请渡河找后援部队，不幸急湍的寒流卷没了我们这位优秀的战士。战友们抹干眼泪，空着肚子，坚持开展工作。
    大风雪的季节里，天和地白茫茫连成一片，苍劲的古松也有些战栗不安。但战士们仍逢山开路，遇水搭桥，那怕崇山峻岭、深涧危谷，都不能阻挡战士们前进的心。他们时刻关心着全国人民生活中的每一个重大政治事件，特别是有关我们一定要解放台湾的消息！这消息，成为推动凉山一切工作的动力，使寒冷的凉山变得火热！ 周邦桢
