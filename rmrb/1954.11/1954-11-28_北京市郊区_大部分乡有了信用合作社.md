    Beijing Suburbs
    Most Townships in the Suburbs of Beijing Have Credit Cooperatives

    With the development of agricultural producer cooperatives, credit cooperative organizations in the suburbs of Beijing have been widely established in rural areas. Before the autumn harvest last year, there were only sixty-six credit cooperatives in the rural areas of the suburbs of Beijing; after education on the general tasks of the state's transitional period, by the spring of this year, the number of credit cooperatives had grown to one hundred and eighty-five; around the autumn harvest this year, a number of credit cooperatives were established in conjunction with the development of agricultural producer cooperatives. At present, there are two hundred and sixty-three credit cooperatives in the suburbs of Beijing, and 87 percent of the townships have credit cooperatives. It is expected that every township will have a cooperative this winter and next spring.

    From January to October this year, these credit cooperatives absorbed a total of 62.86 billion yuan in deposits and issued 15.67 billion yuan in loans. The amount of loans issued is equivalent to 65 percent of the amount of loans issued by state banks during the same period. The phenomenon of "selling green seedlings" has long existed in the paddy field areas of the suburbs of Beijing. Last year, Liulangzhuang Township in Haidian District still "sold green seedlings" for more than 1,500 shi, and the peasants suffered usury exploitation of more than 150 million yuan. This year, credit cooperatives have been universally established in nineteen paddy field townships, and 550 million yuan in loans have been issued. With the support of national agricultural loans, the problem of "selling green seedlings" has been basically solved. The broad masses of peasants in the suburbs praised the credit cooperatives as being able to help develop agricultural production and "rescue the urgent and relieve the difficult," calling them the peasants' "happiness cooperatives."

    北京市郊区
    大部分乡有了信用合作社
    北京市郊区的信用合作组织，随着农业生产合作社的发展，已经在农村中普遍建立起来。去年秋收以前，北京市郊农村只有六十六个信用合作社；经过国家过渡时期总任务的教育，到今年春天，信用合作社已经发展到一百八十五个；今年秋收前后，结合发展农业生产合作社，又建立了一批信用合作社。目前，北京市郊区已经有信用合作社二百六十三个，百分之八十七的乡都有了信用合作社。预计今冬明春即可达到乡乡有社。
    这些信用合作社从今年一月到十月，共吸收存款六百二十八亿六千万元，发放贷款一百五十六亿七千万元。发放贷款数量，相当于同时期国家银行贷款数量的百分之六十五。北京市郊稻田地区长期存在着“卖青苗”的现象。海淀区六郎庄乡去年还
  “卖青”一千五百多石，农民受高利贷剥削达一亿五千多万元。今年十九个稻田乡普遍建立了信用合作社，发放出五亿五千万元的贷款，再加上国家农贷的支持，“卖青”的问题基本上得到了解决。郊区广大农民都称赞信用合作社既能帮助发展农业生产，又能“救急救难”，是农民们的“幸福社”。    （祝遵璜）
