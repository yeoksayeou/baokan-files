    The Research Department of Renmin University of China convened a symposium on the study of "Dream of the Red Chamber" on November 15th. Participants included Vice Presidents Hu Xikui and Nie Zhen, as well as comrades from the Chinese Language Teaching and Research Office, the Philosophy Teaching and Research Office, and the Chinese History Teaching and Research Office.

    In his speech, Vice President Hu Xikui pointed out that the significance of this criticism of "Dream of the Red Chamber" research lies in using the Marxist-Leninist standpoint, viewpoint, and method to oppose the bourgeois standpoint, viewpoint, and method, and to further consolidate the ideological position of the working class. He called on everyone to actively participate in this battle on the ideological front, and to carry out academic criticism in a guided, planned, and step-by-step manner from all aspects to draw a clear line in ideology. He also pointed out that in carrying out this work, it is necessary to oppose the ideology of "authority" and the crude attitude of subjective arbitrariness, to deeply study and delve into Marxism-Leninism and specialized knowledge, and to use truth to persuade people.

    Li Xifan, Wang Jinding, Shang Yue, He Sijing, Zeng Xiankai, Wu Rong, He Luo, Wang Nan, Hu Hua, and others spoke at the meeting. In their speeches, they criticized from various aspects the reactionary "experimentalism" viewpoints and methods of the Hu Shi school in the academic field, criticized the poison spread by Yu Pingbo in his research on "Dream of the Red Chamber" by using such viewpoints and methods, and made a general analysis of the historical conditions in which "Dream of the Red Chamber" was produced and its main social content. Everyone expressed their willingness to actively respond to this call and continue to conduct in-depth research and criticism.

    In his concluding remarks, Vice President Nie Zhen said that this discussion on the research of "Dream of the Red Chamber" was only the beginning, and it should continue to be carried out in the future. Finally, Vice President Hu Xikui emphasized that in order to achieve greater victory in this struggle between the world view and methodology of the working class and the world view and methodology of the bourgeoisie, it is necessary to strengthen the study of Marxist-Leninist philosophy.

    Teachers of the Classical Literature Group of the Chinese Literature Teaching and Research Section of the Chinese Department of Beijing Normal University, graduate students of the Classical Literature Group of the Research Class, and some students gathered on October 29th, and Associate Professor Qi Gong conveyed the situation of the first discussion on the "Dream of the Red Chamber" issue by the Writers Association. On November 4th, a free-talking session was held, and Professor Tan Pimo and Professor Li Changzhi introduced the situation of the joint meeting of the Writers Association and the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles on the discussion of this issue. At the free-talking session, the Hu Shi school's bourgeois idealistic viewpoint held by Yu Pingbo in the research of "Dream of the Red Chamber" was analyzed and criticized. Many speakers pointed out that this bourgeois idealistic viewpoint in academics not only exists in Yu Pingbo, but also manifests, to varying degrees, in the lectures of some teachers in the university. And this erroneous viewpoint has not yet received the criticism it deserves. Everyone expressed dissatisfaction with the style of many newspaper editors who maintain so-called "authority" and despise the work of young academics. During the discussion, everyone unanimously believed that this discussion is a serious struggle of Marxist literary and academic thought against bourgeois idealistic viewpoints in the literary and academic circles during the transition period of the country. Everyone also expressed their willingness to participate in this struggle seriously and conscientiously. On November 13th, all faculty and graduate students of the Chinese Department held another meeting, and Professor Huang Yaomian, director of the department, made a mobilizing report on the issue of launching academic discussions. Director Huang Yaomian summarized the recent situation of criticism and discussion on the Hu Shi school's bourgeois idealistic viewpoint in the study of "Dream of the Red Chamber", and arranged the requirements, methods and principles to be grasped for the discussion of the "Dream of the Red Chamber" issue. He asked everyone to participate in the discussion seriously. (Liu Fuhui)

    The Chinese Department of Henan Normal College convened a symposium on the study of "Dream of the Red Chamber" on November 9th. More than 200 people attended the meeting. Acting President Ji Wenfu and Acting Dean of Academic Affairs Guo Xiaotang also participated in the symposium. In addition, comrades from the Party Committee of Henan Provincial Higher Education Institutions and the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles also attended the meeting. At the meeting, professors spoke one after another. They criticized Yu Pingbo's bourgeois idealist viewpoints in the study of "Dream of the Red Chamber" from the perspective of research methods of classical literature. In their speeches, everyone believed that the study of classical literature should focus on the people's content and the realistic creative methods of the work. If we only circle around the form and techniques, we will inevitably embark on the road of abandoning the essence and pursuing the superficial; the textual research of classical literature must be combined with the study of the ideological content and historical background of the work, otherwise it will fall into the quagmire of formalism for the sake of textual research. During the symposium, everyone examined that they did not pay enough attention to the bourgeois idealist viewpoints in teaching and academic research. At the same time, through this symposium, they further realized the importance of strengthening the study of Marxism-Leninism.

    Tianjin cultural and academic circles convened the first symposium on the study of "Dream of the Red Chamber" on the 11th. Attendees included literary and art workers and professors of classical literature from the Chinese Departments of universities and colleges. The symposium was presided over by Fang Ji, director of the Municipal Bureau of Culture. He said that he hoped that through this discussion on the study of "Dream of the Red Chamber", a style of free criticism and free discussion could be cultivated in the cultural and academic circles of Tianjin, so as to achieve the purpose of promoting academic research. Hua Cuishen, a professor at Nankai University, and writer Lu Li spoke one after another. They analyzed and criticized Yu Pingbo's mistakes in the study of "Dream of the Red Chamber", and pointed out that Yu Pingbo's research methods of "Dream of the Red Chamber" followed Hu Shi's bourgeois idealist and formalist viewpoints and methods. They also pointed out that the pernicious influence of Hu Shi's reactionary philosophy still has a great influence among many higher intellectuals, and has not been systematically liquidated. At the symposium, everyone unanimously believed that this criticism and discussion should be launched in all aspects of the academic circles, so as to further strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism in the academic circles and thoroughly eliminate the erroneous ideas of the bourgeoisie.

    对“红楼梦”研究中的错误观点展开批评
    天津文化学术界召开关于“红楼梦”研究的座谈会
    中国人民大学研究部在十一月十五日召开了关于“红楼梦”研究问题的座谈会。参加座谈会的有副校长胡锡奎、聂真和中国语文教研室、哲学教研室、中国历史教研室等单位的同志。
    胡锡奎副校长的发言指出，这次“红楼梦”研究问题批判的意义，就是用马克思列宁主义的立场、观点和方法反对资产阶级的立场、观点和方法，继续巩固工人阶级的思想阵地。他号召大家积极地参加到这一思想战线上的战斗中去，有领导、有计划、有步骤地从各方面展开学术批评，划清思想界限。他并指出，在进行这一工作中，必须反对“权威”思想和粗暴的主观武断的态度，要深入地学习、钻研马克思列宁主义和专门业务，用真理去说服人。
    在会上相继发言的有李希凡、汪金丁、尚钺、何思敬、曾宪楷、吴容、何洛、王南、胡华等。在大家的发言中，从各个方面批判了胡适学派在学术领域中所散布的资产阶级的反动的“实验主义”的观点、方法，批判了俞平伯运用这种观点、方法在研究“红楼梦”中所散布的流毒；并对“红楼梦”所产生的历史条件及其主要的社会内容，作了概括的分析。大家表示要积极地响应这一号召，继续深入地进行研究和批判。
    聂真副校长在总结发言中说，这次对“红楼梦”研究问题的讨论只是开端，今后应继续贯彻开展下去。最后，胡锡奎副校长强调指出，为了使这次工人阶级的世界观、方法论同资产阶级的世界观、方法论的斗争取得更大的胜利，必须加强马克思列宁主义哲学的学习。（杨建中）
    北京师范大学中文系中国文学教研室古典文学组的教师和研究班古典文学组的研究生以及部分学生，在十月二十九日集会，由启功副教授传达了作家协会第一次讨论“红楼梦”问题的情况。十一月四日又召开漫谈会，由谭丕谟教授和李长之教授介绍了作家协会和全国文联联席会议关于讨论这一问题的情况。漫谈会上对俞平伯在研究“红楼梦”方面所持的胡适派资产阶级唯心论观点进行了分析批判。许多发言者指出：这种学术上的资产阶级唯心观点不仅存在于俞平伯的身上，而且在本校某些教师的讲课中，也程度不同的表露着这种错误观点。而这种错误观点至今还没有受到应有的批判。大家对许多报刊编辑维护所谓“权威”，轻视青年学术工作者的作风，表示不满。讨论中大家一致认为：这次讨论，是国家过渡时期文艺界、学术界的马克思主义文艺思想、学术思想对资产阶级唯心论观点的严重斗争。大家并表示要严肃认真地参加这个斗争。十一月十三日，中文系全系教职员和研究生又举行大会，由系主任黄药眠教授作了关于展开学术讨论问题的动员性报告。黄药眠主任概括地叙述了最近关于对“红楼梦”研究中的胡适派资产阶级唯心论观点进行批判讨论的情况，布置了对“红楼梦”问题讨论的要求、方法以及应掌握的原则。他要求大家认真参加讨论。　（刘福惠）河南师范学院中文系在十一月九日召开了“红楼梦”研究的座谈会。出席这个会议的有二百余人。代院长嵇文甫、代教务长郭晓棠等也参加了座谈会。此外，出席会议的还有河南省高等学校党委会和省文联的同志。会上，教授们相继发言。他们从研究古典文学的观点、方法等方面批判了俞平伯在“红楼梦”研究中的资产阶级唯心主义观点。大家在发言中认为：研究古典文学应以作品的人民性的内容和现实主义的创作方法为主，如果只在形式和技巧上兜圈子，就必然会走上舍本逐末的道路；古典文学的考证工作必须同研究作品的思想内容和时代背景相结合，否则就会陷入形式主义为考证而考证的泥坑。在座谈中，大家检查了自己在教学和学术研究上对资产阶级唯心论的观点没有引起足够的重视。同时，通过这次座谈，更进一步认识到加强学习马克思列宁主义的重要意义。
