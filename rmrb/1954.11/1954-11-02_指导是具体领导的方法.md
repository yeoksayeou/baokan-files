Guidance is a Method of Concrete Leadership
Chulayev, Deputy Director of the Department of Party, Trade Union, and Youth League Organs of the CPSU Central Committee

Editor's Note: This article comprehensively and profoundly elaborates on the issue of how Party organizations should strengthen concrete leadership over economic work. It points out that in order to strengthen concrete leadership over economic work, it is necessary to eradicate bureaucratic formalism and strengthen lively and concrete guidance. Leading personnel of Party organizations must step out of their offices and go to grassroots organizations to provide them with practical and effective on-the-spot guidance. Party leading organs should maintain regular contact with personnel sent to work in grassroots organizations, and their work should be summarized when these personnel return. After China entered planned economic construction, the Party's leadership over economic work has indeed improved greatly; however, it must be pointed out that the phenomenon of Party work lagging behind economic work in the past has not changed much, and many Party workers still use meetings and documents to replace lively and concrete leadership. Therefore, the issues and methods proposed in this article are of great reference value to our Party workers.

The practical life at present particularly urgently demands the continuous improvement of Party work. Practice often convinces us that the tasks of further developing the Soviet economy, sharply increasing agriculture, and increasing the production of consumer goods for the people can only be successfully resolved under the condition of continuously improving the Party's leadership methods. What is referred to here is eradicating the bureaucratic and formalistic leadership style, strengthening lively work among the masses, and first of all strengthening concrete guidance in all links of Party organs. The Party strives to ensure that the energy of organ workers is not spent on writing official documents, but is used to guide people on the spot.

Obviously, there is no need to prove that there is no more effective method of leadership than providing practical and serious guidance to Party organs and individual workers. It is necessary to know that guidance is concretely pointing out: what needs to be done and how to do it, why it needs to be done, and within what time limit a certain task should be completed and why this time limit must be adhered to. The purpose of guidance is to enable Party workers to understand the task and to arm them with the best methods to complete this task.

How to achieve this?

To truly teach Party workers what to do and how to do it, it is necessary to understand these workers, to talk to them, and also to study the specific conditions of local work. This means best ensuring the correct guidance of local work.

Recently, Party workers have been going to grassroots organizations more frequently. A year ago, some secretaries of state committees and other workers rarely went to district Party organizations, and even if they went, they only stayed for a short time. Now, business trips are more frequent and the duration of business trips is longer. For example, the Bashkir State Party Committee has significantly strengthened its lively contact with rural Party organizations, and has sent more members of the Standing Committee of the State Committee and other responsible personnel, as well as leading personnel of the Soviets, to various districts. The State Committee pays special attention to helping some backward districts. For example, a working group headed by a member of the Standing Committee of the State Committee was sent to Ulu-Telyak District; several leading personnel groups were also sent to Abzanovo, Pokrov, Madraevo and several other districts. Many members of the State Committee have been on long-term business trips to districts reclaiming virgin and fallow land, giving practical help to the district committees of the CPSU. They stayed in the districts for twenty to thirty days, actively guiding the work of local Party, Soviet and economic organs, giving political reports to the working people and talking with them. Thanks to these helps, the Baymak, Abzelilovo, Khaibullinsky and other districts completed the spring field work on time. During the period of preparing for and carrying out spring plowing, the secretary of the Bashkir State Party Committee and the leading staff of the Council of Ministers of the Bashkir Republic visited all the remote and backward districts of the republic.

Recently, the staff of the Molotov State Party Committee of the CPSU often go on business trips. It is enough to point out the following facts: in just two and a half months, the eleven instructors of the Party, Trade Union, and Youth League Organs of the State Committee went on business trips to the districts thirty-one times, staying there for a total of two hundred and fifty days. As for the staff of the municipal and district committees, they usually rarely sit in the office. The work being done by the organs is improving. The plenary session of the Molotov State Party Committee of the CPSU discussed how to implement the resolutions of the September and February-March plenary sessions of the CPSU Central Committee. After this plenary session, the secretary of the State Committee explained in detail to the staff of the State Committee the work facing them, and used concrete examples to illustrate the tasks of field management, preparing for harvest, and purchasing fodder. It was decided that the ministers and instructors of the State Committee would go to each collective farm together with the district committee secretaries to help organize all this work. This method of work enables the district committee secretaries, collective farm chairmen, and agrotechnicians to enrich themselves with good experience with the help of the staff of the State Committee.

But this does not mean that the on-the-spot guidance work is going well. Does each of these business trips fulfill its mission, and does each of them produce the effect that skilled guidance work should produce? This is not a meaningless question, which can be easily seen from the example of some Party organizations.

The staff of the Molotov State Committee often go to Kizel: this is an important coal-producing area in the country, so the Party organization often pays attention to this area. The purpose of these business trips is to strengthen the role of the municipal committee and the entire Party organization in the struggle to complete and overfulfill the coal mining plan. However, many coal mines have not completed the plan month after month, the coal mining speed is growing very slowly, and preparatory work has not been guaranteed to be completed on time. Last year, the coal-producing area gave the country tens of thousands of tons less coal; the debt owed is growing rapidly this year. In many respects, this is due to the incorrect working methods of the municipal committee and the grassroots Party organizations. Of course, in the notice on the main tasks of the Party organization, in the general instructions on the Party organization should fight for the completion of the economic plan, the guidance of the staff of the State Committee to the staff of the municipal committee is not without shortcomings. But the most important work they did not do was not to truly study the working situation of the Party organization and its working methods, and did not carry out purposeful education of cadres. And this is also reflected in the work style of the municipal committee.

Only when one understands the specific tasks and working conditions of a certain Party organization, only when one studies the cadres of this organization in practical work, can effective opinions be put forward. For example, each coal mine has certain characteristics, and the Party organization must know and take these characteristics into account. For example, the Lenin Coal Mine often completes the plan, but the municipal committee does not carefully study the working situation, but is satisfied with the achievements that have been obtained. If the Party workers carefully studied all parts of the coal mine's work, then they would find another situation, and they could help the Communists strengthen their influence in the coal mine. For example, it cannot be ignored that many workers here have not completed the production quota, and the cyclic coal mining operation method is used very slowly. Obviously, if the Party organization paid attention to ensuring that every worker completed the quota, then the plan could be greatly overfulfilled. The Party organization should enable the workers to study, master technology, and correctly organize their labor.

There are other reserves for increasing coal mining in the coal mine. But the Party organization did not pay attention to fully utilizing these reserves. For example, in March, all the personnel of the coal mine signed a convention to produce two thousand tons more coal than planned. Because there was no real help for all the personnel to estimate their potential, the standards set in this convention were obviously suppressed: the plan was overfulfilled by nearly five thousand tons without any special effort or special technical and organizational measures. In order to correctly guide the Party workers, all of this should be known.

These are a few facts that show the characteristics of the Lenin Coal Mine. The Capital No. 6 Coal Mine is another matter. Here, the daily coal mining plan is often not completed. There is a lot of talk about cyclical operations, but this work has not been widely organized. In this coal mine, indifference is often shown to improving labor conditions and workers' lives, and to strengthening youth education. All the personnel of the coal mine have not been well mobilized to complete the socialist work tasks. Comrade Leiziyev, the secretary of the coal mine's Party organization, did not raise these issues, and his actions were often not like a Party worker, but like a terrible formalist: he wrote a resolution, pinned it in a file folder, and felt safe. For example, the Party's decision on the coal mine's work on January 17 this year still remains on paper, and many suggestions of the Communists have not been implemented.

All these characteristics should be taken into account when guiding Party workers. Only in this way can truly beneficial opinions be put forward: how to work, how to correctly implement tasks under the specific conditions of a certain Party organization. If this is not done, guidance will definitely become a stereotypical, bureaucratic instruction, a repetition of generally known truths. However, in the Kizel area, Party workers do not always study the specific working situation of each Party organization. For example, when the two ministers of the municipal committee, Comrades Solovyov and Yuzhekov, went to various places, they only superficially treated the issues of Party work and did not coordinate Party work with the completion of the national plan. The same is true for the instructors. For example, Comrade Grebeshikov, an instructor of the Party, Trade Union, and Youth League Organs of the State Committee, has been to the Party organization of the Lenin Coal Mine more than once, but he only knows the percentage of completion of the plan. He only pays attention to those who have not paid Party dues in time, only studies Party documents, but does not understand the entire work of the Party organization, and therefore cannot help the Party organization eliminate shortcomings in its work and increase coal mining.

These shortcomings in the guidance of the city's Party organization are in many ways due to the incorrect guidance of the staff of the city committee. Guidance work is not based on an in-depth study of the specific practice of local Party organizations, and is of an overly general nature, completely failing to help promote good working experience.

Guidance should not only be based on theoretical principles; it should also estimate the materials provided by practice. Leadership is only truly correct and effective when it reflects practice, ensures the prevention of shortcomings, and uses good experience. At present, it is particularly important to ensure that guidance work can quickly promote all the good things accumulated by the practice of Party organizations. However, for this, it is necessary to deeply study the practice of Party organizations.

From the experience of the same Party organization in the Molotov State, it is easy to recognize that no matter how informative and specific the opinions are, opinions alone are not enough. Where does the power of the outstanding rural district party committees lie? First of all, it lies in the fact that when they reorganize their work, they not only study the work of agricultural machinery stations, collective farms, and state farms, but also, based on this study, give specific opinions to local workers, telling them how they should work, and also actually doing it to show them. No matter what issue the staff of the Party organs are on a business trip for, only when he not only tells how he should work, but also organizes this work, is his action correct. Guidance is inseparable from organizing implementation, inseparable from inspecting implementation, and inseparable from selecting and deploying cadres. If the staff of the State Committee goes to the district to check the implementation of the resolution on leading the preparation of the harvest, he cannot limit himself to collecting materials and putting forward opinions on how to do better in certain circumstances; he must help the district committee during the time he lives in the district, and must practically organize the work, not only pointing out the shortcomings, but also striving to eliminate these shortcomings. Under such conditions, cadres will grow up faster and the Party's leadership will be truly improved.

In the Osin District of Molotov State, the instructors were Comrades Nefedov and Shulin. Comrade Nefedov had no experience and did not do his job well. For example, he went to the "In Memory of Lenin" collective farm several times, talked to the branch secretary, and put forward opinions to the branch secretary. But the work there improved very slowly. The political work and organizational work of the branch among the collective farmers were very poor. The Party organization's supervision of the activities of the management office was not carried out correctly. All this affects the condition of the public economy. Comrade Shulin worked in another way: he did not limit himself to making suggestions, but actually organized the work and put forward practices. For example, he not only suggested that communists should be deployed in collective farms according to the tasks facing the Party organization, but also pointed out how to do better. Some collective farm propaganda groups carried out work separated from specific economic tasks. Comrade Shulin improved the guidance of the propagandists and the supervision of their work, so that the propagandists strengthened their individual work with the collective farmers. Of course, such guidance ensures excellent practical results and ensures faster improvement of the professional skills of the collective farm Party workers.

In order to carry out concrete guidance, in order to coordinate guidance with organizational work, it is necessary to make the entire Party organ, especially the leaders of the Party Committee, engage in guidance work. The secretaries of the state, municipal, and district committees are the most skilled Party workers. They should point out what work is the main link to ensure the resolution of urgent tasks for a certain Party organization, and in what way is it best to organize this work. The ministers of the various departments of the Party Committee can also and should provide practical help to the workers of the grassroots Party organizations. At present, it is particularly intolerable that the secretaries of the Party Committees and the leaders of the departments believe that guidance work is the task of the instructors, not the task of all leading workers, and therefore, for example, the secretaries can not delve into the details of the work. Lively leadership, guidance - this is first of all the responsibility of the leaders of the Party Committees.

It goes without saying that, even so, the instructors of the Party Committees are of special significance in further improving the Party's leadership. Now the requirements for instructors are constantly increasing, so it is very important to eliminate the phenomenon of underestimating the instructors. Due to the underestimation of the instructors, those who can guarantee correct guidance are far from always being absorbed to do this work. Many people who do the work of instructors are people who have neither received training suitable for the current working conditions nor have the necessary experience. However, now, when practical life requires improving Party work and further improving the professional skills of Party workers, it is very important to make the communists who work as instructors be those who understand the work, strive to broaden their horizons, are responsible for the work, do not wait for instructions in every occasion, but act bravely, as the local situation requires.

While raising the requirements in the selection of cadres, especially in the selection of instructors, it is also necessary to strengthen the work of the organs of the state, municipal, and district committees. The shortcomings in guidance work are in many ways due to the serious shortcomings that exist in the leadership of the organs: sometimes the activities of the organs are not organized correctly, the formalistic way is adopted, and there is little concern for expanding the horizons of the staff and arming them with practical skills.

Take economic issues as an example. The Party's leadership can only be skilled when Party workers truly deeply understand economic issues. Now, without understanding agriculture and understanding the issues of agricultural technology and animal husbandry, it is impossible to successfully lead agriculture. Practice tells us that without a certain minimum of knowledge, it is simply impossible to go to agricultural machinery stations, collective farms, or state farms now, let alone conduct guidance. The same is true in industry. Without understanding the issues of improving labor productivity, product cost, economic accounting system, etc., it is impossible to guide the secretaries of grassroots Party organizations in factories. Without a certain amount of knowledge, guidance is bound to become impractical guidance, and the Party's work will lose its meaning by being separated from the struggle to resolve economic and political tasks. However, not all state, municipal, and district committees organize the staff of the organs to study economic issues and master some necessary knowledge, without which it is impossible to move an inch under the current conditions.

The staff of the Party organs not only need a minimum of theoretical knowledge. Since it is impossible to conduct correct guidance without considering advanced experience, the Party workers should be armed with this experience. The Party Committee should know and should know in detail all the best experience accumulated by the individual Party organizations, collective farms, state farms, agricultural machinery stations, and enterprises in the state or district, so that the Party organs can promote this experience and rely on this experience when conducting guidance. However, Party organs rarely discuss the achievements of advanced producers. When on business trips, the staff sees many noteworthy things, but no one knows about it except themselves.

The Grakhov District of the Udmurt Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic is a backward district. The State Committee has passed a resolution on this district, but at present the situation has not changed essentially. This year, very little fertilizer has been applied to the fields, and many collective farms have violated agricultural technology regulations during the cultivation time. However, it is necessary to know that there is also advanced experience in the district, and some Party organizations have successfully promoted their collective farms from the backward rank. The Party organization of the Michurin collective farm is such a case. This year, the collective farm completed spring plowing in two-thirds less time than last year. All winter wheat land has been harrowed, mineral fertilizer has been applied, the necessary amount of manure has been applied to the fields, and the plan for planting potatoes using the square cluster planting method has been completed. All this shows that the Party organization has strengthened its influence on the working situation of the collective farm. However, the State Committee and the District Committee have not studied the experience of this Party organization, and the Party workers do not understand how this Party organization has achieved its achievements, so they cannot use the experience of this Party organization when guiding the work of other Party organizations. Why not establish such a system: everything new that happens in practice must be discussed in the organs without delay? There is no doubt that this will help improve guidance work.

It goes without saying that the staff of the Party organs should know the resolutions of the Party organs and the tasks facing the Party organizations in a certain period. If the instructor of the State Committee does not know the resolutions of his own Party Committee, but only encounters these resolutions when he is on a business trip to the District Party Committee, then there is no talk of skilled guidance. Obviously, under such circumstances, the instructor cannot give the District Party Committee the necessary help.

All this should be paid attention to by the secretary of the Party Committee first. He should be responsible for eradicating the bureaucratic and formalistic leadership methods in the organizational work of the organs, and for strengthening guidance work. For this, it is very important to make the staff of the Party organs have as much time as possible to live in the localities, to do lively work, instead of drafting official documents. However, the work is rarely organized in this way, for example, so that the instructors spend their main time in the grassroots Party organizations; before sending a person on a business trip, he must be given a clear task and armed with the ability to correctly resolve the task that has been put forward. However, in many places, the guidance of the organ staff who are sent on business trips is done incorrectly. Where are these shortcomings?

Just understanding the work of some state, municipal, and district committees can know that the guidance given to the organ staff who are sent on business trips to various organizations is usually of an overly general nature. For example, in the early stage of the spring plowing movement, the Chkalov State Party Committee of the CPSU sent the staff of the state to forty-eight agricultural districts. Comrade Antonov, the second secretary of the State Committee, was responsible for giving them guidance reports. In fact, these were the most general parting words and instructions on raising the state's agriculture, as for analyzing the specific experience accumulated by the Party organizations, they never even thought about it.

However, even if this guidance report is very good, this is still not enough. After general guidance, individual talks are very important. It is necessary to know that each district has its own characteristics, so it is necessary to talk with each person before sending him on a business trip. At the same time, it should not be simply talking about what to do, but also to clarify together in detail: how is the economy in the district, how are the cadres there, who has been there recently and what did they see, what shortcomings have been discovered, how to overcome it better. Of course, it is impossible to put forward opinions on everything, and it is impossible to solve all the problems before understanding the situation on the spot, but there is no doubt that as many problems as possible should be discussed before the business trip, so that there will be more confidence and strength when working. Conducting individual talks with the organ staff before the business trip will also definitely help the leaders of the Party Committee to find out: whether the task has been correctly understood, and whether it can be considered that the problems that occur on the spot will be correctly resolved. The leaders of the Chkalov State Committee did not pay attention to this.

The same is true for the guidance work of the various departments. Due to the general and empty guidance, the staff of the departments of the State Committee did not get the necessary preparation for the specific work of the districts. For example, Comrade Nosov, an agronomist instructor of the Department of Agriculture, stayed in the Andreev District for twelve days, but he did not give the District Committee any specific help on agricultural issues, and in fact he limited his task to participating in the plenary session of the District Party Committee. Comrade Mushienna, the head of the Propaganda Department of the State Committee, stayed in the Teplov District for fifteen days, where she handled two cases of accusations, learned about the work of the "Ural" state farm propaganda group and the district's newspaper. Comrade Mushienna found out that the newspaper often made serious mistakes, and the District Committee did not lead its newspaper well. The newspaper editor was often sent to the collective farm for a long time as the plenipotentiary representative of the District Committee. Comrade Mushienna did not improve the leadership of the newspaper locally, and after returning to the State Committee, she reported to Comrade Shebalshov, the minister of the Propaganda Department, and Comrade Shebalshov did not do anything to improve the newspaper work in the Teplov District. The Teplov District newspaper made serious mistakes as before.

The staff of the Party, Trade Union, and Youth League Organs of the State Committee were also poorly prepared for the business trip to the district. Minister Strelnikov had not been to the district for four months, and of course, he did not know what kind of help the district committee needed. The department had not even studied the working experience of the instructor group of the District Committee in the agricultural machinery station area in one district. The state has many good examples in the work of the instructor group. For example, the Petrov agricultural machinery station instructor group of the Ak-Bulak District, led by Comrade Filippov, the secretary of the District Committee, is good at organizing political work during the spring sowing period. The group enabled the tractor work team to complete and overfulfill the production quota from the very beginning. However, the Party, Trade Union, and Youth League Organs of the State Committee did not know the experience of these groups. Of course, under such circumstances, the staff on business trips in the department cannot actually carry out any guidance. The department had fifteen people on business trips in April, people were not given individual opinions, and they did not study the working situation in the district in advance, and did not understand the specific tasks that should be solved. What kind of help can the District Committee expect to get? Even experienced staff, if they go to the District Committee on a business trip without any preparation, cannot immediately decide what is the main thing, what should be started first, how to work better, and what goals to achieve.

Practice points out that it is important not only to train each staff well before going on a business trip to the Party organization, but also not to forget them when the staff lives there. For example, the staff of the Chelyabinsk State Committee said very reasonably: no one cares about their work when they are on a business trip, and they do not have close contact with the State Committee at this time. It should be pointed out that the guidance of the staff on business trips to the District Committee has been improving recently. The staff of the Party, Trade Union, and Youth League Organs of the State Committee know the economic work and political work of the organizations they are going to from various documents before the business trip, and talk with some staff who know the work of these organizations. However, in the process of completing the task, additional opinions are almost always needed, and it is always necessary to exchange opinions. For example, the instructor of the State Committee went to check whether there were serious shortcomings in the work of the Troitsk District Committee. After the inspection, he reported the summary of the inspection at the plenary session of the District Committee, and made many incorrect conclusions; the State Committee had to correct his mistakes. If the instructor maintains contact with the State Committee, if he can ask for the opinions of his leaders in time, these mistakes can be easily avoided. But here, such a practice has not been established. If the staff of the State Committee do things their own way, they cannot always correctly guide the Party organizations in the district.

All this reminds us again and again that after the Party Committee sends its staff to the lower-level Party organizations, it should maintain regular contact with these staff. For example, if the State Committee passes a new resolution or has new tasks while the instructor of the State Committee is working in the Party organization of the district, it should notify the instructor of all this, so that they can provide the necessary help to the staff of the district. At the same time, when the instructor understands the life of the Party organization in the district more deeply, he can put forward some suggestions, and it is very important to discuss these suggestions with the leaders of the State Committee.

After the staff of the Party Committee returns from the business trip, the work must be summarized, the shortcomings must be pointed out, the initiative must be supported, and the problems raised by him based on the materials must be analyzed. It is not only appropriate to do this at the organ meeting. The secretary of the State Committee and the ministers of the departments can know a lot by talking to each staff who has been to a certain organization. This makes it possible for them to study the life of the Party organization more deeply, understand the development process of new things faster, and take the necessary measures in time. At the same time, such a conversation is the most effective way to conduct the work of the Party Committee organs.

The staff groups of the District Party Committee in the agricultural machinery station area particularly need business help. These groups often live in collective farms due to the nature of their work. For them, the most important thing is not to get rid of the District Committee: to get timely notifications of the resolutions of the Party organs, and to have the opportunity to consult opinions on the problems that occur. If these groups are not given regular help, these groups will have a very poor effect on the agricultural machinery stations and collective farms. For example, the staff group of the Georghiev District Committee sent to the Obirilenn agricultural machinery station in the Stavropol region, instead of guiding the secretaries of the grassroots Party organizations on the spot, and giving them help, is keen on convening various meetings in the agricultural machinery station and wasting a lot of time collecting various materials. The group's work plan is full of measures of this kind: convening meetings of wall newspaper editors, meetings of Party organization secretaries, meetings of agronomists, meetings of farm staff, and meetings of Youth League organization secretaries. Obviously, preparing for and convening these meetings takes a lot of time, and there is no time for guiding the grassroots Party organizations and carrying out organizational and educational work for the collective farm members. If Comrade Popov, the first secretary of the District Committee, could pay more attention to the instructor group and give them help on the spot, the above-mentioned facts would not have happened.

It goes without saying that working towards the organs is not just about making explanations regularly; this work cannot be replaced by repeated telling and trivial regulations. It is necessary to require each staff to work hard to expand their horizons. Now the staff of the Party Committees are writing fewer and fewer kinds of official documents, and they can use more time to read books to increase their knowledge. In addition, they should also enrich themselves with the experience of the Party organizations to which they belong. Carefully studying and considering this experience is the most correct way to improve the professional skills of Party workers. Finally, the staff of the Party organs also have the opportunity to participate in the Party representative meetings, the plenary sessions of the Party Committees, and the activist meetings, and this is an important school for a thoughtful person who really wants to become an excellent leader who is good at skillfully guiding other staff.

Maintaining lively contact with Party organizations, deeply studying the local working situation, and skillfully conducting guidance - this is the guarantee of regularly improving Party work. Guidance is not only the most important part of Party work, but also a concrete leadership method to eradicate formalistic and bureaucratic working styles. Practice has proved that attempting to lead by issuing general instructions and by passing resolutions that are equally applicable to all organizations cannot guarantee the resolution of the complex tasks facing Party organizations in cities and rural areas. Precisely because of this, it has become very necessary to further improve guidance. Caring about regularly improving guidance is the most important duty of the Party Committee.

    指导是具体领导的方法
    苏共中央党、工会、青年团机关工作部副部长　楚拉也夫
    编者按：这篇文章全面地深刻地阐述了关于党组织如何加强对经济工作的具体领导问题。它指出了，为了加强对经济工作的具体领导，就要根除党的领导工作中的文牍主义和官僚主义作风，加强生动的具体指导工作。党组织的领导人员必须走出办公室，到基层组织中去，给予这些组织以实际有效的就地指导。党的领导机关对于派到基层组织中去工作的人员，要保持经常的联系，当这些人员回来后，就要总结他们的工作。我国进入有计划经济建设后，党对经济工作的领导的确有了很大的改善；但是必须指出，过去的党的工作落后于经济工作的现象并没有改变多少，至今还有很多的党的工作人员仍然用会议、文件来代替生动的具体的领导工作。因此这篇文章中所提出的问题和方法，对我们党的工作人员，有很大的参考价值。
    目前实际生活特别迫切地要求经常改善党的工作。实践经常使我们深信，进一步发展苏联经济、急剧地提高农业和增加人民消费品生产的任务，只有在不断改善党的领导方法的条件下，才能顺利地获得解决。这里所指的就是根除文牍主义和官僚主义的领导作风，加强在群众中进行生动的工作，首先是加强党机关各个环节中的具体指导工作。党力求使机关工作人员的精力不是耗费在写公文上，而是用来就地指导人们。
    显然用不着证明，再没有比对党机关和个别工作人员进行切实的严肃的指导更为有效的领导方法了。要知道指导就是具体地指出：需要做什么和怎样做，为什么需要做这个，某一工作应当在什么期限内完成和为什么必须坚持这个期限。指导的目的是使党的工作人员了解任务，并以最好地完成这一任务的方法来武装他们。
    怎样做到这一点呢？
    要真正教会党的工作人员做什么和怎样做，就需要了解这些工作人员，需要同他们谈谈，而且还需要研究当地工作的具体条件。这就是说，要最好地保证对当地工作的正确指导。
    最近党的工作人员比较经常地到基层组织去。一年以前某些州委书记和其他工作人员很少到区的党组织去，而且即使去了，也只呆很少时间。现在出差比较经常了，出差的时间也比较长了。例如，巴什基里亚州党委显著地加强了同农村党组织的生动的联系，更多地派州委的常委委员和其他负责人员以及苏维埃的领导人员到各个区去。该州委特别注意帮助一些落后的区。例如，该州委以常委委员为首的工作人员小组被派到乌鲁—捷良斯克区；一些领导人员小组同样被派到阿勃查诺夫、坡克罗夫、玛德拉也夫和其他若干区。该州委的很多委员长期地出差到开垦生荒地和熟荒地的各区，给予苏共各区委以实际的帮助。他们在区里停留二十天到三十天，积极地指导地方党、苏维埃和经济机关的工作人员，向劳动人民作政治报告并和他们座谈。由于这一些帮助，巴义马克、阿勃捷里洛夫、哈义布尔林和其他各区及时地完成了春天的田间工作。在准备和进行春耕的时期，巴什基里亚州委书记和巴什基里亚共和国部长会议的领导工作人员去过该共和国所有边远的和落后的各区。
    最近苏共莫洛托夫州委的工作人员常常出差。只要指出下列事实就够了：仅仅在两个半月的时间内，该州委的党、工会和青年团机关工作部的十一个指导员出差到区里去了三十一次，在那里总共住了二百五十天。至于市委和区委的工作人员，他们通常很少坐在办公室里。对机关进行的工作正在改善中。在苏共莫洛托夫州委全会上讨论了如何实现苏共中央九月和二—三月全会决议的问题。在这次全会以后，该州委书记详细地向州委工作人员讲述了面前摆着的工作，用具体的例子说明了田间管理、准备收获和征购饲料的任务。决定州委各部部长和指导员同区委书记一起到每个集体农庄去，帮助把这全部工作组织起来。这种工作方法，使区委书记、集体农庄主席和农艺技师在州委工作人员的帮助下能以好的经验来充实自己。
    但这还不是说，就地指导工作进行得很好。这些出差是否每一次都完成自己的使命，是否每一次都产生了熟练的指导工作所应当产生的效果？这并不是一个毫无意思的问题，这一点从某些党组织的例子上可以很容易地看到。
    莫洛托夫州委的工作人员常常到基捷尔去：这是全国重要的产煤区，所以党组织经常注意这个地区。这些出差的目的是加强市委和整个党组织在争取完成和超额完成采煤计划的斗争中的作用。但是很多煤井一月又一月地没有完成计划，采煤速度增长得很慢，准备工作没有保证按时完成。去年产煤区少给了国家几万吨煤；今年欠的债很快地增长着。在很多方面这是由于市委和基层党组织的工作方法不正确的原故。当然，在关于党组织的主要任务的通知中，在关于党组织应当为完成经济计划而斗争的总的指示中，州委工作人员对市委工作人员的指导是没有缺点的。但是最主要的工作他们却没有做，即没有真正深入地研究党组织的工作情况和它的工作方法，没有对干部进行有目的的教育。而这也反映在市委的工作作风上。
    只有在了解了某一党组织的具体任务和工作条件的时候，只有在实际工作中研究了这一组织的干部的时候，才能提出有效的意见。例如，每一个煤井都有某种特点，这种特点是党组织一定需要知道和考虑到的。例如，列宁煤井经常完成计划，但是市委没有仔细地研究工作情况，而满足于已得到的成绩。如果党的工作人员认真地研究了煤井工作的各个部分，那末他们就会发现另一种情况，就能帮助共产党员加强他们自己在煤井中的影响。例如，不能不考虑到这里很多工人没有完成生产定额，循环采煤作业法使用得很慢。显然，假如党组织注意了使每个工人都完成定额，那就可以大大地超额完成计划。党组织应当使工人们进行学习，掌握技术，使他们的劳动正确地组织起来。
    该煤井还有其他提高采煤量的后备力量。但是党组织没有注意去充分利用这些后备力量。例如，在三月份煤井的全体人员订出公约要超过计划再出产二千吨煤。由于没有真正帮助全体人员来估计自己的潜力，因而这一公约中所订的标准显然是被压低了的：没有经过什么特别的努力，也没有采取技术上和组织上的特别措施，就超额几达五千吨完成计划。为了正确地指导党的工作人员，所有这一切都是应当知道的。
    这就是表明列宁煤井的特点的几件事实。卡比塔尔第六号煤井则是另外一回事。这里一昼夜的采煤计划常常没有完成。关于循环作业讲得很多，但是没有广泛地组织过这一工作。该煤井中对于改善劳动条件和工人生活、对于加强青年教育往往是漠不关心的。没有很好地把该煤井的全体人员动员起来完成社会主义工作任务。该煤井党组织书记雷丝也夫同志没有提出这些问题，他的行动往往不像一个党的工作人员，而像一个糟糕的文牍主义者：写一写决议，把它订在文件夹子里，就安然无事了。例如，今年一月十七日党的会议关于该煤井工作的决定仍然停留在公文上，共产党员的很多建议也都没有执行。
    在对党的工作人员进行指导的时候，所有这一切特点都是应当考虑到的。只有这样才能提出真正有益的意见：怎样工作，在某一党组织的具体条件下怎样正确地执行任务。不这样做，指导就一定成为千篇一律的、官僚主义的指示，成为大家知道的一般真理的重复。但是，在基捷尔地区，党的工作人员远非任何时候都去研究每个党组织的具体工作情况。例如，市委的两个部长索洛维也夫同志和尤热科夫同志到各地去的时候，只是表面地对待党的工作问题，没有把党的工作和完成国家计划配合起来。指导员也是这样的情况。例如，党、工会和青年团机关工作部的指导员格雷别西科夫同志不止一次地到过列宁煤井的党组织，但是他只知道完成计划的百分比。他只注意没有及时交纳党费的人，只研究党的文件，但是不去了解党组织的整个工作，因而也就不能帮助党组织消灭工作中的缺点，增加煤的采掘量。
    市的党组织在进行指导中的这一些缺点，其本身在很多方面是由于对市委工作人员的指导不正确的原故。指导工作并没有建立在深入地研究当地党组织的具体实践的基础上，带着过于一般的性质，完全没有帮助推广好的工作经验。
    指导不仅要以理论原理为基础；它还要估计到实践所提供的材料。领导只有在反映实践、保证防止缺点和运用好的经验时，才真正是正确的、有效的。目前特别重要的是使指导工作能保证很快地推广党组织的实践所积累下来的一切好的东西。但是，为此又需要深刻地研究党组织的实践。
    从同一个莫洛托夫州的党组织的经验中很容易认识到，无论意见如何有内容，如何具体，但单是意见还是不够的。优秀的农村区党委的力量是在什么地方呢？首先是在于，它们在改组自己的工作时，不仅研究农业机器站、集体农庄和国营农场的工作情况，不仅根据这种研究给当地工作人员提出具体的意见，向他们讲述应当如何工作，而且还要实际上做出来给他们看。无论党机关的工作人员为了什么问题出差，只有当他不仅讲述应当如何工作，而且还组织这一工作的时候，他的行动才是正确的。指导是和组织执行分不开的，是和检查执行分不开的，是和挑选与配备干部分不开的。如果州委的工作人员到区里去检查关于领导准备收获的决议的执行情况，他就不能局限于收集材料和提出在某种情况下怎样做得更好些的意见；他住在区里的时间必须帮助区委，必须实际地组织工作，不仅指出缺点，而且要力求消灭这些缺点。在这样的条件下，干部就会更快地成长起来，党的领导就会得到真正的改善。
    在莫洛托夫州的奥辛区，指导员是涅非道夫同志和舒林同志。涅非道夫同志没有经验，没有把自己的工作做好。例如，他到“纪念列宁”集体农庄去了几次，同支部书记进行了谈话，向支部书记提出了意见。但是那里的工作改进得很慢。支部在集体农民中间的政治工作和组织工作做得很差。党组织对管理处活动的监督进行得不正确。这一切都影响着公共经济的状况。舒林同志则按另一种方式进行工作：他没有局限在提意见上，而是实际地组织工作，提出做法。例如，他不仅提出意见，说集体农庄中应当按照党组织所面临的任务来配备共产党员，而且指出要怎样做得更好。某些集体农庄的鼓动团脱离了具体的经济任务进行工作。舒林同志改进了对鼓动员的指导和对他们工作的监督，使鼓动员加强了向集体农民个别地进行的工作。当然，这样的指导保证了优良的实际效果，保证了更快地提高集体农庄党的工作人员的业务能力。
    为了进行具体的指导，为了使指导同组织工作配合起来，那就必须使整个党的机关、首先是党委的领导者从事指导工作。州委、市委和区委的书记是最熟练的党工作人员。他们应当指出什么工作对于某一党组织是保证解决迫切任务的主要环节，用什么方式把这一工作组织得最好。党委各部部长也能够而且应当对基层党组织的工作人员进行实际的帮助。目前特别不能容忍的是这样的事实：党委书记和各部的领导者认为，指导工作是指导员的任务，而不是所有领导工作人员的任务，因而，例如，书记就可以不钻研工作细节。生动的领导、指导——这首先是党委领导者的职责。
    不言而喻，虽然如此，可是党委的指导员在进一步改进党的领导方面是有特殊意义的。现在对指导员的要求不断提高着，因而消灭那种对指导员估计不足的现象是非常重要的。由于对指导员估计不足，所以远非任何时候都把那些能保证进行正确指导的人们吸收来做这一工作。做指导员工作的有不少是这样的人，他们既没有受过适合于当前工作条件的训练，也没有必需的经验。但是，现在，当实际生活要求改进党的工作，要求进一步提高党工作人员的业务能力的时候，非常重要的是使作指导员的是这样的共产党员，他了解工作，力求扩大自己的眼界，对工作有责任心，不是在每一个场合下都等待指示，而是勇敢地行动，就像当地的情况所要求的那样。
    在选拔干部、特别是选拔指导员时要提高要求，同时也必须加强对州委、市委和区委机关进行的工作。指导工作中的缺点在很多方面是由于机关的领导方面所存在的严重缺点：有时候机关的活动组织得不正确，采用文牍主义的方式，很少关心扩大工作人员的眼界并以实际的技能来武装他们。
    就拿经济问题来作例子。党的领导只有在党工作人员真正深入地了解经济问题的时候才能是熟练的。现在不懂得农业，不理解农业技术和动物饲养术问题，就不可能顺利地领导农业。实践告诉我们，没有一定的最低限度的知识，现在就简直不能到农业机器站、集体农庄或国营农场去，更不用说要进行指导。工业中也是同样的情况。不了解提高劳动生产率、产品成本、经济核算制等等问题，就无法指导工厂基层党组织的书记。没有一定的知识，指导就必然成为不合实际的指导，党的工作就会脱离争取解决经济和政治任务的斗争而丧失意义。但是，并非所有的州委、市委和区委都组织机关工作人员去学习经济问题，去掌握一些必要的知识，而缺乏这些知识，在当前条件下是寸步难行的。
    党机关的工作人员不仅需要最低限度的理论知识。既然不考虑到先进经验就无法进行正确的指导，所以就应当以这种经验来武装党的工作人员。党委应当知道而且应当详细地知道州或区的个别党组织、集体农庄、国营农场、农业机器站、企业所积累下来的一切最好的经验，使党的机关能够推广这一经验，在进行指导时依靠这一经验。然而党机关很少讨论先进生产者的成绩。在出差的时候，工作人员看到了很多值得注意的东西，但是除了他们自己外，谁都不知道了。
    乌德摩尔梯苏维埃社会主义自治共和国格拉霍夫区是一个落后区。州委通过了有关这一区的决定，但是目前情况没有什么本质的变化。今年田里的肥料上得很少，在耕作时间很多集体农庄又违反了农业技术规程。但是要知道，区里也有先进的经验，有的党组织顺利地使自己的集体农庄从落后的等级擢升起来。米丘林集体农庄的党组织就是这样。该农庄今年以比去年少三分之二的时间完成了春耕。全部冬麦地都已经耙平了，上了矿物肥料，田里还上了必要数量的粪，完成了用方形簇种法栽种马铃薯的计划。所有这一切都表明党组织加强了自己对该集体农庄工作状况的影响。但是州委和区委都没有研究这个党组织的经验，党工作人员不了解这个党组织是怎样取得成绩的，因而在指导其他党组织的工作时不能利用这个党组织的经验。为什么不建立这样的制度：实践中发生的一切新东西，必须毫不拖延地在机关中加以讨论？毫无疑问，这对指导工作的改进将有所帮助。
    不言而喻，党机关的工作人员应当知道党机关的决议和党组织在某一时期所面临的任务。如果州委的指导员不知道自己党委的决议，而只是在出差到区党委的时候，才碰到这些决议，那就谈不上有熟练的指导。显然，在这种情况下指导员是不能给区委以必要的帮助的。
    所有这一切，党委书记首先应当加以注意。他应当负责在组织机关工作中根除文牍主义和官僚主义的领导方法，并加强指导工作。为此很重要的是使党机关工作人员有尽量多的时间住在地方上，去做生动的工作，而不是去草拟公文。然而很少是这样地去组织工作的，例如，使指导员在基层党组织里度过自己主要的时间；在派一个人出差之前，必须给他提出明确的任务，并以正确解决所提出的任务的本领来武装他。但是，很多地方对被派出差的机关工作人员的指导是做得不正确的。这些缺点在什么地方呢？
    只要了解某些州委、市委和区委的工作就可以知道，向出差到各个组织去的机关工作人员所进行的指导通常还是带着过于一般的性质。例如，在春耕运动的初期，苏共契卡洛夫州委派该州的工作人员到四十八个农业区去。负责向他们作指导报告的是州委第二书记安东诺夫同志。其实，这是最一般的送行的话以及关于提高该州农业的若干任务的指示，至于分析党组织所积累的具体经验，则连想都没有想过。
    但是，即使这个指导报告很好，这毕竟还是不够的。在一般的指导以后，个别谈话是非常重要的。要知道每一个区都有自己的特点，因而在派每个人出差以前必须与他进行谈话。同时，应当不是简单地谈一谈做些什么，而且要一起详细地弄清楚：该区的经济如何，那里的干部怎么样，最近谁到那里去过和看见了什么，已经发现了什么缺点，怎样更好地克服它。当然，要给一切情况提出意见是不可能的，在就地了解情况以前要解决一切问题也是不可能的，但是毫无疑问，在出差以前应当尽可能讨论更多的问题，以便工作的时候更有信心更有力量。向出差前的机关工作人员进行个别谈话，也一定会帮助党委领导者弄清楚：任务是否正确地理解了，是否可以认为就地发生的问题会得到正确的解决。契卡洛夫州委的领导者没有注意到这一点。
    各部的指导工作也是同样的情况。由于一般的空洞的指导，该州委各部的工作人员没有得到区的具体工作所必需的准备。例如，农业部的指导员农学家诺素夫同志曾经在安得烈也夫区呆了十二天，但是他在农业问题上并没有给区委什么具体的帮助，实际上他把自己的任务只限于参加区党委全体会议。该州委宣传鼓动部的科长穆希恩娜同志曾经在捷普洛夫区呆了十五天，她在那里处理了两件控诉案，了解了“乌拉尔”国营农场鼓动团的工作以及该区的报纸。穆希恩娜同志查明，该报常常犯严重的错误，区委没有很好地领导自己的报纸。该报编辑常常作为区委的全权代表被派往集体农庄去很长时间。穆希恩娜同志在当地不曾改善对报纸的领导，而回到州委以后向宣传鼓动部部长谢巴尔萧夫同志作了汇报，谢巴尔萧夫同志也没有作些什么来改善捷普洛夫区的报纸工作。捷普洛夫区的报纸和以前一样犯着严重的错误。
    州委的党、工会和青年团机关工作部的工作人员对出差到区里去也准备得很差。部长斯特列里尼科夫同志有四个月没到区里去了，当然，他也就不知道这个或那个区委需要什么样的帮助。该工作部甚至连一个区里的农业机器站地区的区委指导员小组的工作经验都没有研究过。该州在指导员小组工作方面有很多好的榜样。例如，区委书记费利帕夫同志所领导的阿克—布拉克区的彼得洛夫农业机器站指导员小组，就善于在春季播种期间组织政治工作。该小组使拖拉机工作队从最初几天起就完成和超额完成生产定额。但是州委的党、工会和青年团机关工作部却不知道这些小组的经验。当然，在这种情况下，该部的出差的工作人员实际上是不能进行任何指导的。该部在四月有十五个人出差，人们没有向他们个别地提出意见，而他们也没有预先研究区内的工作情况，没有了解那些应当解决的具体任务。区委能指望得到什么样的帮助呢？甚至有经验的工作人员，没有丝毫准备就出差到区委去，也不能马上决定什么是主要的东西，首先应当着手作什么，怎样工作得更好，要达到什么目的。
    实践指出，重要的不仅是在出差到党组织以前要好好地训练每一个工作人员，而且当工作人员住在那里的时候，也不能把他们忘掉。例如，齐略宾斯克州委的工作人员说得很有道理：谁也不关心他们在出差时的工作，他们在这个时候和州委会没有密切的联系。应该指出，最近对出差到区委的工作人员的指导是在改进中。该州委的党、工会和青年团机关工作部的工作人员在出差前从各种不同的文件中知道他们所去的那些组织的经济工作和政治工作，同一些知道这些组织的工作人员进行谈话。但是在完成任务的进程中，差不多总是需要补充的意见的，总是需要交换意见的。例如，该州委的指导员去检查特洛伊茨克区党委工作中是否存在着严重的缺点。检查之后，他在区委全体会议上报告了检查的总结，而且作了很多不正确的结论；州委不得不去改正他的错误。如果指导员和州委保持联系，如果他能及时地征求自己领导者的意见，这些错误是很容易避免的。但是在这里，这样的作法还没有确立起来。如果州委的工作人员自行其是，他们就不能始终正确地指导区的党组织。
    所有这一切一次又一次地提醒我们，党委把自己的工作人员派到下级党组织去以后，应当和这些工作人员经常地保持着联系。比方说，当州委的指导员在区的党组织里工作的期间，州委如果通过了新的决议，有了新的任务，就应当把这一切都通知指导员，使他们能对区的工作人员进行必要的帮助。同时，当指导员更深入地了解区的党组织的生活时，他就能提出一些建议来，而把这些建议同州委领导者一起加以讨论，这是很重要的。
    当党委的工作人员出差回来以后，必须给他的工作做出总结，指出缺点，支持他的主动精神，分析他根据材料所提出的问题。这不仅仅在机关会议上来做才是适当的。州委书记、各部部长同每一个到过某一组织去的工作人员进行谈话，是能知道很多东西的。这使他们有可能更深入地研究党组织的生活，更快地了解新的事物发展过程，而且及时地采取必要的措施。同时，这样的谈话是对党委机关进行工作的最有效的方式。
    区党委在农业机器站地区的工作人员小组特别需要业务上的帮助。这些小组由于自己工作的性质，是经常住在集体农庄的。对他们来说，最重要的是不脱离开区委：及时地得到关于党机关决议的通知，有可能就发生的问题征询意见。如果不对这些小组进行经常的帮助，这些小组对农业机器站和集体农庄的作用就会很差。例如，盖奥尔多基耶夫区委派到斯达维罗宝里边区奥比里年斯克农业机器站的工作人员小组，它不去就地指导各基层党组织的书记，不给他们以帮助，而醉心于在农业机器站召开各种各样的会议，浪费很多时间来收集各种材料。小组工作计划充满着这一类的措施：召开墙报编辑会议、党组织书记会议、农艺师会议、农场工作人员会议、青年团组织的书记会议。很明显，准备和召开这些会议需要不少时间，而指导基层党组织，向集体农庄庄员进行组织工作和教育工作，就没有时间了。假如该区委第一书记波波夫同志能更多注意一下指导员小组，就地给它们帮助，那末上述的事实就不会发生了。
    不言而喻，向机关进行工作并不是仅仅经常作解释而已；这一工作是不能用反复的讲述和琐细的规定来代替的。必须要求每个工作人员自身努力扩展自己的眼界。现在党委的工作人员愈来愈少写各种各样的公文了，他们能用更多时间读书来增加自己的知识。此外，他们还应当以他们所在的党组织的经验来充实自己。仔细地研究和考虑这一经验，是提高党工作人员的业务能力的最正确的途径。最后，党机关的工作人员还有机会参加党代表会议、党委全体会议和积极分子会议，而这对于一个真正想成为善于熟练地指导其他工作人员的优秀领导者的深思熟虑的人来说，乃是一个重要的学校。
    和党组织保持生动的联系，深刻地研究当地的工作情况，熟练地进行指导，——这是经常提高党的工作的保证。指导不仅是党的工作最重要的一部分，而且是根除文牍主义和官僚主义工作方式的具体的领导方法。实践证明，企图用颁布一般的指示，通过对一切组织都同样适用的决定的方法来进行领导，便不能保证解决现在城市和农村的党组织所面临的复杂任务。正因为如此，所以进一步改进指导就成为非常必要的了。关心经常改进指导，是党委最重要的一个义务。
