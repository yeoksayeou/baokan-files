    Anhui Province Vigorously Develops Credit Cooperative Organizations
    Sichuan Province's Newly Built Credit Cooperatives are All Very Active
    Anhui Province has been vigorously developing credit cooperative organizations since October. By the end of September, the province already had 1,481 credit cooperatives, 101 credit departments, and 7,689 credit groups. The distribution of credit cooperatives and credit departments covered 18% of the total number of townships. In October, credit cooperative organizations in the province experienced new development. Farmers in disaster areas, who are rebuilding their homes and engaging in production for self-relief, need to mobilize more funds and have a more urgent need to organize credit cooperatives. In October, the Fuyang Special District newly established 695 credit cooperatives to support disaster-stricken people in production for self-relief. Many disaster victims call credit cooperatives their "production support" and "small banks for emergency relief."
    Recently, Party committees at all levels in Anhui Province have strengthened their leadership over credit cooperative work. Party committees at all levels have generally established specialized management agencies to be responsible for grasping the guidelines, policies, and plans for carrying out credit cooperative work, organizing summaries and promotion of experiences, and at the same time, especially strengthening leadership over relevant business departments, requiring banks to establish credit cooperative divisions and vigorously carry out credit cooperative work. Counties have successively begun training credit cooperative cadres. Since late September, the Fuyang Special District has trained more than 1,700 key personnel for running cooperatives and district cadres through short-term training courses. In the large-scale establishment of credit cooperatives, the special district and counties have deployed cadres to organize work groups, which go deep into key areas to provide specific assistance in carrying out work. The Lu'an Special District has successively organized 87 bank cadres to conduct roving guidance and assistance in various places. Within a month, they have assisted various places in establishing and preparing more than 400 credit cooperatives. (Yu Jun)
    The more than 1,900 credit cooperatives newly built in Sichuan Province before this year's autumn harvest are now very active in their business activities. In coordination with the unified purchase of grain and cotton, credit cooperatives in Jiangjin, Neijiang, Suining, Mianyang, Leshan and other five special districts absorbed deposits of more than 24.48 billion yuan in October alone, while issuing loans of more than 2.74 billion yuan in autumn plowing and sowing. The loans issued by nine credit cooperatives and nine credit mutual aid groups in Qingfu County helped local farmers add 37 head of cattle and more than 1,600 pieces of bamboo, wood, and iron farm tools, and purchase more than 350 pigs. In addition to providing loans to help members purchase large quantities of means of production, the sixteen newly built credit cooperatives in Peng County also helped more than 200 farmers overcome difficulties in illness, funerals, and life. Newly built credit cooperatives in Xinfan, Guanxian and other places have also signed deposit-loan combination contracts with agricultural production cooperatives to help the agricultural production cooperatives solve the problem of insufficient funds for autumn harvest and increasing the planting of one season of crops.
    Now, the number of farmers requesting to join credit cooperatives and organize credit cooperatives is increasing day by day. At the end of June this year, the number of farmers participating in credit cooperative organizations accounted for only 1% of the total agricultural population, but now it has increased to 9%. In major grain-producing areas and cash crop areas, there is almost one credit cooperative in each district, and individual counties have developed to the point where every township has a credit cooperative.

    安徽省各地大力发展信用合作组织
    四川省新建的信用合作社业务都很活跃
    安徽省从十月份起大力展开发展信用合作组织的工作。到九月底止，全省已经有信用合作社一千四百八十一个，信用部一百零一个，信用小组七千六百八十九个。信用合作社和信用部的分布面，达总乡数的百分之十八。十月间，全省的信用合作组织又有新的发展。灾区农民由于正在重建家园，进行生产自救，需要调剂更多资金，对组织信用合作社要求更加迫切。阜阳专区十月份新办了六百九十五个信用合作社，支持了灾民生产自救。许多灾民都称呼信用合作社是自己的“生产靠山”，是“救急救难的小银行”。
    安徽省各级党委最近都加强了对信用合作工作的领导。各级党委一般都设立了专管机构，负责掌握开展信用合作工作的方针、政策和计划，组织总结和推广经验，同时，特别加强了对有关业务部门的领导，要求银行设立信用合作股，大力开展信用合作工作。各县已经先后开始训练信用合作干部。阜阳专区从九月下旬起，采取短期训练班的方式，已经训练了办社骨干和区干部一千七百多人。在大规模建立信用合作社的工作中，专区和县都调配干部组织工作组，深入到重点地区具体帮助开展工作。六安专区先后组织八十七个银行干部巡回深入各地进行指导、帮助，一个月内，就协助各地新建和筹备了四百多个信用合作社。　（余浚）
    四川省今年秋收前新建的一千九百多个信用合作社，现在业务活动都很活跃。江津、内江、遂宁、绵阳、乐山等五个专区的信用合作社配合粮食、棉花统购，在十月份一个月内吸收存款二百四十四亿八千多万元，同时在秋耕秋种中发放贷款二十七亿四千多万元。庆符县九个信用合作社和九个信用互助组发放的贷款，帮助当地农民添置耕牛三十七头和竹、木、铁器农具一千六百多件，购买猪三百五十多只。彭县十六个新建的信用合作社除贷款帮助社员添置大批生产资料外，还帮助二百多户农民克服了疾病、丧葬和生活中的困难。新繁、灌县等地新建的信用合作社还和农业生产合作社订立存贷结合合同，帮助农业生产合作社解决了秋收和增种一季作物的资金不足的困难。
    现在各地农民要求加入信用合作社和组织信用合作社的日渐增多。今年六月底，全省参加信用合作组织的农民只占农业人口总数的百分之一，现在已增加到百分之九。各主要粮食产区和经济作物地区，差不多每个区有一个信用合作社，个别县已发展到乡乡有信用合作社。　（新华社）
