Jiangxi Provincial Institute of Agricultural Sciences
Successfully Trials Mandarin Oranges on Acidic Red Soil

    The Jiangxi Provincial Institute of Agricultural Sciences has successfully trialed the planting of Wenzhou mandarin oranges on acidic red soil, where plants do not grow well, and has already harvested some of the fruit.

    The thirty Wenzhou seedless mandarin orange trees transplanted from Changsha in the spring of 1953 by the Jiangxi Provincial Institute of Agricultural Sciences have all yielded fruit this year, with the most productive tree bearing more than 330 mandarin oranges. The more than 100 Wenzhou mandarin orange saplings that the Institute of Agricultural Sciences grafted and cultivated themselves and planted in 1950 have also borne fruit this year, with the more fruitful ones producing more than 70 each. The harvested Wenzhou mandarin oranges weigh more than six taels each for the larger ones. This type of mandarin orange tastes very good, is very juicy, has a high sugar content, is seedless, and can be stored well, and is almost the same as the original products from Wenzhou, Zhejiang.

    In order to utilize acidic red soil and "transform barren mountains into orchards," the scientific workers of the Jiangxi Provincial Institute of Agricultural Sciences have, over the past few years, conducted thorough research on the properties of acidic red soil and the cultivation experience of the origin, adopted scientific cultivation methods, and implemented methods such as applying more farmyard manure and intercropping with green manure during the transplantation, grafting, and cultivation of Wenzhou mandarin oranges, finally achieving success in changing the properties of acidic red soil.

    江西省农业科学研究所
    在酸性红壤上试种蜜柑成功
    江西省农业科学研究所在不大生长植物的酸性红壤上试种温州蜜柑成功，已经采下了部分果实。
    江西省农业科学研究所在一九五三年春季由长沙移植的三十株温州无核蜜柑树，今年全部结果，每株最多的结了三百三十多个蜜柑。农业科学研究所自己嫁接培育的和一九五零年定植的一百多株温州蜜柑小树，今年也结了果实，结果较多的每株有七十多个。已采下的温州蜜柑，较大的有六两多重。这种蜜柑味道很好，水分很多，并且糖分高，无核，耐贮藏，和浙江温州原地产品相差不多。
    江西省农业科学研究所的科学工作者为了利用酸性红壤，“变荒山为果园”，几年来，在移植、嫁接、培育温州蜜柑过程中，很好地研究了酸性红壤的性质和原产地的培育经验，采用了科学的栽培方法，以及多施农家肥料和绿肥间种等方法，终于在改变酸性红壤的性质方面得到成功。（新华社）
