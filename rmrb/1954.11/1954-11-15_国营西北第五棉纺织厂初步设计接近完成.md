The preparatory work for the state-owned Northwest No. 5 Cotton Textile Factory is progressing actively. This factory will have 100,000 spindles and more than 4,600 automatic looms, with a construction area nearly 30,000 square meters larger than the state-owned Northwest No. 4 Cotton Textile Factory currently under construction. After the factory is completed, it will not only produce a large amount of white sheeting, but also a large amount of fine cotton cloth, which has never been produced in the Northwest before and is specially used for printing brightly colored patterns; it will also produce beautiful and durable yarn-dyed gabardine and yarn-dyed serge fabrics.

The preparatory work for the factory began last winter. At present, surveying personnel have completed topographic surveys, geological drilling, and soil testing. With the help of Soviet experts, the preliminary design is nearing completion. The number of personnel in the preparatory office is increasing one after another, and nearly 10,000 tons of steel, wood and other building materials have been transported to the construction site.

    国营西北第五棉纺织厂初步设计接近完成
    国营西北第五棉纺织厂的筹建工作正在积极进行。这个厂将拥有十万纱锭，四千六百多台自动布机，建筑面积比目前正在建设的国营北第四棉纺织厂大了近三万平方公尺。这个厂子建成后，不仅能生产大量白细布，而且还要大量生产西北从来没有生产过的、专供印染彩色鲜丽的精细棉布；还要生产漂亮、结实的纱直贡呢和纱哔叽布等。
    该厂筹建工作从去年冬天就开始了。目前，勘测人员已经完成了地形测量、地质钻探和土壤试验。在苏联专家帮助下，初步设计已接近完成。筹建处的工作人员正陆续增加，已有近万吨的钢材、木材等建筑材料运到工地。
