Xinhua News Agency, Rome, November 28th: According to TASS, Italian Communist Party General Secretary Togliatti spoke in the Chamber of Deputies on the 26th, severely condemning Italian Foreign Minister Martino's negative attitude towards the Soviet proposal to hold an all-European conference.

Togliatti pointed out that public opinion now believes that the moment has arrived to either take a decisive step forward or to halt and reverse the current development of easing international tensions. The note presented by the Soviet government gives us the opportunity to take such a step forward. Rejecting the Soviet proposal would mean missing the above opportunity and would clearly seriously threaten and nullify the achievements made in the past. Whether European countries answer "yes" or "no" to the questions raised by the Soviet government to European countries will determine the future of the people of Europe and the people of the world.

Togliatti pointed out that Martino had already expressed a negative attitude towards the Soviet proposal in talks with newspaper reporters. Togliatti said that, unfortunately, our government has for many years been accustomed to basely submitting to the policies of major imperialist countries, abandoning any independent, Italian national stance. This is a very serious mistake.

Togliatti refuted many arguments put forward by government officials that the date of November 29th for convening the meeting proposed by the Soviet government seemed "too urgent." He said: The Soviet note clearly points out the peaceful purpose of Soviet foreign policy, while the imperialist countries use words such as "peace," "relaxation," and "agreements between countries" to conceal their conspiracy to permanently divide the world into two. Togliatti further pointed out that the imperialist countries' policy of arming West Germany and restoring German military industry will lead to a deterioration of international relations in Europe, making this relationship more acute in form and nature than it was a few years ago.

Togliatti said: It is completely natural and reasonable for the people of the Soviet Union, Poland, and Czechoslovakia, as well as the people of other countries that have suffered from German aggression, to take various measures to defend their own security. They are no longer preventing a threat, but are guarding against the real existence of 500,000 armed Germans, and against former Hitler generals commanding their divisions.

At the end of his speech, Togliatti called on the Italian masses to intensify their struggle for peace.

Foreign Minister Martino spoke after Togliatti. He tried to justify the Italian government's negative attitude towards the Soviet proposal. Togliatti spoke again, expressing dissatisfaction with Martino's reply.

    意共总书记陶里亚蒂在议院发言
    斥意大利外交部长对苏联建议的否定态度
    【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社罗马消息：意大利共产党总书记陶里亚蒂二十六日在下议院发言，严厉地斥责了意大利外交部长马蒂诺对苏联关于举行全欧会议的建议所抱的否定态度。
    陶里亚蒂指出，现在舆论相信这样一种时机已经到来了：不是向前迈进有决定意义的一步，就是阻止和改变目前缓和国际紧张形势这一发展进程。苏联政府提出的照会使我们有机会向前迈进这样的一步。如果拒绝苏联建议，那么就会放过上述机会，而且显然一定会使以往所取得的成绩受到严重威胁，并且将化为乌有。欧洲各国对苏联政府向欧洲各国所提的问题究竟作“是”或“否”的答复，将决定欧洲各国人民和全世界人民的前途。
    陶里亚蒂指出，马蒂诺在同报纸记者的谈话中，已经对苏联的建议表示了否定的态度。陶里亚蒂说，不幸，我们的政府多年来已习惯于卑贱地屈从大帝国主义国家的政策，放弃任何独立的、意大利的民族立场。这是非常严重的错误。
    陶里亚蒂驳倒了许多政府人士提出来的关于苏联政府所提议的十一月二十九日召开会议的日期似乎是“太急迫”的那种论据。他说：苏联的照会明确地指出了苏联外交政策的和平目的，而帝国主义国家则利用“和平”、“缓和”、“各国之间协议”等字眼来掩饰他们永久把世界分裂为二的阴谋。陶里亚蒂又指出，帝国主义国家武装西德和恢复德国军事工业的政策将导致欧洲国际关系的恶化，使这种关系比几年以前带有更为尖锐的形式和性质。
    陶里亚蒂说：苏联、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克人民以及遭受过德国侵略的其他国家人民采取各种措施来保卫自己的安全，是完全自然而合理的，他们现在已经不是在预防威胁了，而是在防备五十万武装的德国人的现实存在了，在防备统率着自己的师团的前希特勒将领了。
    陶里亚蒂在发言的最后号召意大利人民群众加紧斗争，争取和平。
    外交部长马蒂诺继陶里亚蒂之后发言。他力图为意大利政府对苏联建议采取的否定态度进行辩解。陶里亚蒂又一次发言表示不满意马蒂诺的答复。
