The All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives convened a national cooperative native produce exchange meeting in Beijing from October 18th to November 5th. Representatives from cooperatives in twenty-four provinces, three municipalities directly under the central government, six provincial-level cities, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, as well as relevant central departments, totaling fifty-one units, participated in the meeting.

This meeting was the first national native produce exchange meeting held by the cooperative system. Based on the balance of native produce purchasing and sales plans in various provinces and cities, the meeting organized and planned the exchange of national small native products, appropriately arranged domestic and foreign purchasing and sales businesses, and played an important role in regulating the supply of materials between urban and rural areas, supporting national industrial construction, supporting disaster victims in self-salvation through production, and guiding the production of small native products. A total of 593 kinds of commodities were traded, with 1,075 contracts and 147 agreements signed, with a total purchase and sales value of 648.8 billion yuan.

In terms of promoting and supplying products from disaster areas, the representatives from various regions demonstrated their enthusiasm for actively supporting the disaster areas. The meeting also adopted methods such as consignment sales and trial sales to assist in the promotion of some disaster area products that were not selling well. A total of 79 kinds of products were promoted for disaster areas, with a total value of 91.4 billion yuan. Cooperative representatives from disaster areas purchased 10.5 billion yuan worth of building materials and production and living supplies for local farmers. The meeting implemented the policy of serving agricultural production. Not only were agricultural and sideline products worth 466.5 billion yuan promoted at the meeting, but also production materials worth 29.8 billion yuan were supplied to rural areas, of which draft animals accounted for a large proportion, with 2,820 mules and horses, and 11,500 donkeys. The meeting also implemented the policy that the domestic sales of small native products should be subordinate to foreign sales and that urban and rural areas should support each other. In the transactions, the needs of national exports and industrial and mining areas in large and medium-sized cities were given priority. State-owned specialized companies completed transactions worth 68.4 billion yuan at the meeting. Through this exchange meeting, various regions basically communicated production and sales information, expanded the business scope of small native products, and improved the enthusiasm of supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions to manage small native products. The participants expressed that they would improve the planning of the management of small native products, guide farmers to improve production, and concentrate the scattered and sporadic native and sideline products from thousands of households as much as possible to meet the needs of the country and the people.
