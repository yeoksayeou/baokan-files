    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, November 12th: The Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party held its second plenary session in Jakarta from the 8th to the 10th of November.

    The meeting adopted the report made by General Secretary Aidit on behalf of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee regarding the expansion of the unity of all national forces in Indonesia. The meeting also adopted the list of candidates from the Indonesian Communist Party and non-party individuals participating in the general election, as explained to the meeting by First Deputy General Secretary Lukman. The meeting heard a statement from Second Deputy General Secretary Njoto regarding the establishment of a constitutional drafting committee and passed a resolution to establish this committee. The Indonesian Communist Party will submit the draft constitution of the Republic of Indonesia, drafted by this committee, to the constitutional assembly to be produced by the general election.

    At a press conference held after the meeting, Aidit said that the potential danger of war is threatening the security and sovereignty of all countries, and at the same time, foreign forces hidden within Indonesia are trying to disintegrate Indonesia's unity. Aidit said that this meeting was convened under such international and domestic circumstances, therefore, the meeting attached great importance to the discussion of expanding the national united front.

    In answering questions from journalists, Aidit said that the Central Committee plenary session considered it correct to continue to support the Ali Sastroamidjojo cabinet. He said: "We understand the positive side of the Ali cabinet, and we also understand its negative side." He also pointed out that the issue of the national united front is not an accidental issue arising in response to the general election, and regardless of who wins the general election, the national unity must be maintained among nationalists, Muslims, and communists.

    In talking about the issue of dissolving the Dutch-Indonesian Union, Aidit said that although this does not mean the near completion of the national struggle, it is of positive significance.

    印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会全会闭幕
    通过艾地所作的关于扩大民族团结的报告
   【新华社雅加达十二日电】印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会八日到十日在雅加达举行第二次全体会议。
    会议通过了总书记艾地代表中央委员会政治局所作的关于扩大印度尼西亚一切民族力量的团结的报告。会议并通过了由第一副总书记鲁克曼向会议说明的参加大选的印度尼西亚共产党和无党派人士的候选人名单。会议听取了第二副总书记约多关于成立一个宪法起草委员会的说明，并通过了成立这个委员会的决议。印度尼西亚共产党将把这个委员会所起草的印度尼西亚共和国宪法草案提交由大选产生的制宪议会。
    在会议结束后举行的记者招待会上，艾地说，潜在的战争危险正威胁着各国人民的安全和主权，同时，隐藏在印度尼西亚国内的外国势力也正在竭力瓦解印度尼西亚的团结。艾地说，这次会议是在这样的国际和国内情况下召开的，因此，会议极其重视扩大民族统一战线的讨论。
    艾地在答复新闻记者提出的问题时说，这次中央委员会全体会议认为，继续支持阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约内阁是正确的。他说：“我们了解到阿里内阁的积极的一面，也了解到它的消极的一面。”他并指出，民族统一战线问题不是因应付大选而产生的一个偶然的问题，不管大选的胜利属于谁，必须在民族主义者、回教徒和共产主义者之间继续保持民族的团结。
    在谈到解散荷兰—印度尼西亚联邦的问题时，艾地说，虽然这并不意味着民族斗争的接近完成，但是，它是具有积极意义的。
