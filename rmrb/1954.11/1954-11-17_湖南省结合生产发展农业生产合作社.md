    Hunan Province Combines Production to Develop Agricultural Production Cooperatives
    This winter and spring, Hunan Province will establish more than 15,000 agricultural production cooperatives. At present, various localities are carrying out cooperative establishment and preparatory work in conjunction with production. Changde and Xiangtan Special Districts, and the suburbs of Changsha City have started the first batch of cooperative establishment work. Pilot projects in Hengyang and Chenxian Special Districts are underway, and a batch of pilot projects in Qianyang Special District that began before autumn are nearing completion. A total of 2,229 new cooperatives have been established in the province, of which 569 are under deliberation, 1,305 are dealing with specific issues, and 355 cooperatives have been built or are nearing completion and have fully entered into production.
    In order to do a good job in preparing for cooperative establishment, various localities began to identify cooperative establishment targets in July and August, and dispatched a large number of cadres for training. According to statistics from six regions including Xiangtan and the suburbs of Changsha and Hengyang, 29,309 cooperative establishment target groups were重点培养 before autumn. In these groups, key personnel were trained, a number of Party and Youth League members were developed, and they were helped to solve specific issues such as work arrangement and settlement of accounts within the groups, so as to further consolidate and improve mutual aid teams. Many areas also organized them to visit existing agricultural production cooperatives on-site, and organized them to study relevant policies on agricultural cooperation, so as to make ideological and organizational preparations for cooperative establishment. Various localities also trained more than 69,000 farmer activists and cooperative management cadres at the county level, with an average of three to five backbone activists in each new cooperative. Due to the long period of training and preparation in advance, judging from the situation of the established cooperatives, most of the mutual aid teams meet the conditions for cooperative establishment.
    The cooperative establishment work in various localities is now being carried out around production. Liling County's cooperatives put forward the slogan of "Do a good job in production to build a good cooperative, produce during the day and build a cooperative at night." Most of the cooperatives in Xiangtan Special District seized the opportunity of autumn and winter planting during the cooperative establishment process. The planting area of ​​late-maturing crops in many cooperatives has been expanded by one time compared with the original plan. For example, the original plan of Li Jiaren Group in Zhouji Township, Second District of Xiangyin County, was to plant 8 mu of rapeseed and 12 mu of broad beans. Since the establishment of the cooperative, 20 mu of rapeseed and 30 mu of broad beans have been planted. (Xiao Chuanjing)

    湖南省结合生产发展农业生产合作社
    今冬明春湖南省各地将建立农业生产合作社一万五千余个。目前各地正结合生产开展建社和建社准备工作。常德、湘潭专区、长沙市郊区已开始第一批建社工作，衡阳、郴县两专区的试点工作正在进行，黔阳专区各县秋前动手的一批试点已快结束。计全省共新建社二千二百二十九个，其中正在进行酝酿的有五百六十九个，正在处理具体问题的有一千三百零五个，有三百五十五个社已经建成或将近建成，并全面转入生产。
    为了做好建社准备工作，各地早在七、八月间，就开始物色建社对象，并抽派大批干部进行培养。据湘潭等六个地区和长沙、衡阳两市郊区统计，秋前已重点培养了建社对象组二万九千三百零九组，在这些组中，重点培养了骨干，发展了一批党、团员，和帮助他们解决组内排工，清工结账等具体问题，进一步巩固和提高互助组；不少地区还组织他们到现有农业生产合作社去实地参观；组织学习有关农业合作化的政策，为建社作好了思想上与组织上的准备。各地还以县为单位训练了农民积极分子和办社干部六万九千多人，平均每个新建社有三至五个骨干积极分子。由于事先经过了较长时期的培养和准备工作，从已建社的情况看，大部分互助组都符合建社条件。
    各地建社工作现正围绕生产进行。醴陵县各社提出“搞好生产建好社，白天生产，晚上建社”的口号，湘潭专区各社在建社中大都抓紧了秋种冬种，许多社的晚熟作物的种植面积，较原计划扩大一倍。如湘阴二区周济乡李家仁组原计划种油菜八亩，蚕豆十二亩，建社以来已种下油菜二十亩，蚕豆三十亩。　（萧传京）
