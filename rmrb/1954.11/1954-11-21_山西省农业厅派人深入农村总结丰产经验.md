    The Shanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture dispatched twenty-eight technical and administrative cadres from September 22nd to November 10th to go deep into rural areas throughout the province. The purpose of this effort was to summarize mass bumper harvest experiences, improve agricultural technology, and further promote the patriotic agricultural increase production campaign next year. Combining this effort with inspections of autumn harvesting and autumn plowing work, they conducted investigations into mass bumper harvest experiences; based on different regions and different focuses, they summarized bumper harvest experiences for different crops. In Jinnan Prefecture, the main cotton-producing area, the focus was on summarizing large-area cotton bumper harvest experiences. During the summary, on the one hand, they studied the growth of cotton in different regions and under different cultivation conditions to find reasonable cultivation methods; on the other hand, they went to Jieyu and Hongzhao counties to focus on summarizing the large-area cotton bumper harvest experiences of the Xizhanggeng and Liu Tiancai agricultural production cooperatives. In Yanbei Prefecture, the same method was used to summarize the situation of potato blight and prevention methods. Other prefectures such as Changzhi, Yuci, and Xinzhou, also summarized large-area bumper harvest experiences of millet, corn and other miscellaneous grains based on local conditions and characteristics. These experiences have now been preliminarily investigated and are being researched and compiled, ready for vigorous promotion next year. (Guo Shi)

    山西省农业厅派人深入农村总结丰产经验
    山西省农业厅为总结群众丰产经验，提高农业技术，进一步推动明年的农业爱国增产运动，于九月二十二日至十一月十日抽调技术和行政干部二十八人，分赴全省各地深入农村，结合检查秋收、秋耕等工作，进行群众丰产经验的调查；根据不同地区不同重点地进行了不同作物的丰产经验的总结。主要产棉区晋南专区着重总结了棉花大面积丰产经验，总结时，一方面研究在不同地区、不同耕作条件下，棉花生长的状况，找出合理的耕作方法；一方面深入解虞、洪赵两县重点总结西张耿和刘天才两个农业生产合作社棉花大面积丰产经验。在雁北专区亦用同样的方法进行了山药蛋疫病情况及防治办法的总结。其他长治、榆次、忻县等专区，亦根据当地不同情况与特点，总结了谷子、玉米等杂粮大面积丰产经验，这些经验现在已初步调查完毕，正在研究整理，准备明年大力推广。　（郭石）
