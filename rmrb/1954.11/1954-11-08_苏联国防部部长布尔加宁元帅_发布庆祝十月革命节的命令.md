(New China News Agency, Moscow, 7th) TASS Moscow reports: The Minister of Defense of the Soviet Union, Marshal of the Soviet Union, N.A. Bulganin, issued an order celebrating the 37th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. The full text of the order is as follows:

Comrade soldiers of the Army and Navy! Comrade non-commissioned officers! Comrade junior officers! Comrade generals!

Today, our heroic Army and Navy, together with all the Soviet people, celebrate the 37th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution.

As always, the working people of our country are greeting this historic day with new achievements in the development of the national economy, science, and culture. The state's industrial production plan is being victoriously fulfilled. All sectors of socialist agriculture are also developing rapidly. Based on the continuous rise of the economy, the material welfare of the Soviet people is constantly improving.

Thanks to the tireless care of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government, our armed forces have obtained the latest weapons and military equipment. The personnel of the Army, Air Force, and Navy have made new achievements in improving military technology and combat readiness.

In the past year, the strength of the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism has been further greatly strengthened. The fraternal friendship between the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people's democracies has been further consolidated.

The Soviet Union has always been loyal to the principles of peace proclaimed by the October Revolution, and has consistently pursued a policy of easing international tensions, a policy of cooperation, and developing relations with all countries.

The policies of the major capitalist countries are completely different. The foundation of their policies remains: preparing for new wars, piecing together military aggression blocs, expanding armaments, and inciting hatred and hostility among the peoples of all countries.

In order to ensure the security of our socialist motherland, we must continue to maintain high vigilance, improve the combat and political training of all services, and resolutely strengthen the power of our armed forces, so that we are always ready to give any aggressor a firm rebuff.

I congratulate all personnel of the Army and Navy on this national holiday, and wish all military personnel new achievements in mastering military technology, improving combat readiness, and strengthening military discipline.

In order to celebrate the 37th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, I order:

Today, November 7th, in our motherland's capital Moscow, in the capitals of all the Union Republics, in Kaliningrad, Khabarovsk, Vladivostok, and in the hero cities of Leningrad, Stalingrad, Sevastopol, and Odessa, a 20-gun salute will be fired.

Long live our powerful motherland, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics!

Long live the great Soviet people and their glorious armed forces!

Long live our dear Soviet government!

Glory to the wise Communist Party of the Soviet Union!

N.A. Bulganin, Minister of Defense of the Soviet Union, Marshal of the Soviet Union

    苏联国防部部长布尔加宁元帅
    发布庆祝十月革命节的命令
    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联国防部部长、苏联元帅尼·亚·布尔加宁发布庆祝十月社会主义革命三十七周年的命令，命令全文如下：
    陆海军士兵同志们！士官同志们！校尉军官同志们！将军同志们！
    今天我们英勇的陆海军和全体苏联人民一起庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命三十七周年。
    我国劳动人民像往常一样，以发展国民经济、科学和文化的新成就来迎接这个历史性的日子。国家的工业生产计划正在胜利地完成着。社会主义农业的各个部门也都在急剧发展。在经济不断上升的基础上，苏联人民的物质福利正在不断地改善。
    由于苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联政府的不倦的关怀，我们的武装部队获得了最新式的武器和军事装备。陆军、空军和海军人员在提高军事技术和战斗准备方面，取得了新的成就。
    在过去一年中，和平、民主、社会主义阵营的力量进一步大大地加强了。苏联、中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家之间的兄弟友谊更进一步巩固了。
    苏联一向忠于十月革命所宣布的和平的原则，一贯坚持不渝地奉行缓和国际紧张局势的政策、奉行合作和与一切国家发展事务联系的政策。
    主要资本主义国家的政策就完全是另一个样子，它们的政策的基础依旧是：准备新战争，拼凑军事侵略集团，扩充军备和煽动各国人民之间的仇恨和敌视。
    为了保障社会主义祖国的安全，我们今后仍然必须保持高度警惕，提高各兵种的战斗和政治训练，坚决加强我们武装力量的威力，以便时刻准备给予任何侵略者以坚决的回击。
    我向陆海军的全体人员祝贺全民的节日，并祝全体军人在掌握军事技术、提高战斗准备和加强军事纪律方面取得新的成就。
    为了庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命三十七周年，我命令：
    今天，十一月七日，在我们祖国的首都莫斯科、在各加盟共和国的首都、在加里宁格勒、罗夫、伯力、海参威，在英雄城列宁格勒、斯大林格勒、塞瓦斯托波尔和敖德萨鸣放礼炮二十响。
    我们强大的祖国苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟万岁！
    伟大的苏联人民及其光荣的武装部队万岁！
    亲爱的苏联政府万岁！
    光荣归于英明的苏联共产党！
    苏联国防部部长、苏联元帅尼·亚·布尔加宁
