Xinhua News Agency, Paris, November 17th: French newspapers are paying close attention to the Soviet government's proposal to convene an all-European conference on November 29 to discuss the establishment of a collective security system.

    "L'Humanité" supports holding an all-European conference. It wrote: "France must seize the opportunity offered to prevent the revival of German militarism and to positively guarantee our security."

    "Libération" emphasizes that the Soviet note confirms how seriously the Soviet Union views the possible consequences of arming West Germany. France should immediately decide on its choice; the governments of the countries that receive the proposal cannot avoid public opposition if they evade or reject it. The newspaper believes that there is no real reason to say that the London and Paris agreements must be approved before negotiating with the East. It advocates postponing the debate on the ratification of these agreements by the French National Assembly, originally scheduled to begin on December 10.

    Contrary to the democratic newspapers, the bourgeois newspapers advocate a negative response to the Soviet government's note.

    "Le Figaro," while believing it is necessary to seek a common agreement with the Soviet Union, also advocates rejecting the Soviet proposal.

    "France-Soir," referring to claims in some foreign newspapers that the Soviet government would be willing to negotiate even after the Paris Agreements are ratified, said that this claim is "somewhat overly optimistic."

    "La Croix" commented on the Soviet note, saying that "despite the calm attitude taken by Bonn officials," the Soviet note "has already caused a shock in West Germany."

    "Le Dimanche" said: "This time, the Soviet Union is not only speaking to the three major powers, but to twenty-three European countries. The Soviet Union has not only raised the issue of a unified Germany, but also the broader issue of security for the whole of Europe."

    "Le Monde" points out: "The West claims that the Soviet Union will tolerate armed Germany, but this statement is somewhat premature." This newspaper expresses its support for a policy of disarmament. It says: "If both sides abandon this path (of disarmament), then people will simply not be able to have any confidence in peaceful coexistence." The newspaper also said: "We have begun to realize what consequences a new arms race will bring to the future of all mankind."

      "Combat" believes that the Soviet Union may convene a conference attended only by those countries that accept the Soviet proposal. The newspaper says: "Observers who are quick to say that this note 'has nothing new' or who purely see it as a tactic to achieve intimidation in the present moment are actually a bit too hasty."

      "Paris Presse" believes that the purpose of the Soviet note is to convene a conference of Eastern European countries to establish an Eastern European bloc opposed to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
Xinhua News Agency, Paris, November 17th: The Soviet note has generated a positive response among some political figures in France.

    National Assembly Vice-President Palewski (Social Republican Party) said:

    I believe that there "is no reason" to reject the proposal to convene a new Paris conference. Palewski said this is especially true because "the Soviet Union has not set any preconditions for considering the proposal for collective security."

    Daniel Mayer, Chairman of the National Assembly's Foreign Affairs Committee, has already expressed his support for giving a positive response to the Soviet note.

    "Combat" points out that the Soviet proposal has strengthened the position of some members of parliament who advocate negotiating with the Soviet Union before debating the ratification of the London and Paris agreements; these members of parliament were deeply impressed by the Soviet note.

  "Combat" says: Playing a considerable role in this regard are some Social Republicans actively supported by General de Gaulle and some Radical Socialists headed by Herriot and Daladier.

### 法民主报纸和政界人士赞成举行全欧会议

    法民主报纸和政界人士赞成举行全欧会议
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：法国各报十分重视苏联政府关于十一月二十九日召开全欧会议讨论建立集体安全体系问题的建议。
    “人道报”拥护举行全欧会议。它写道：“法国必须把握住所提供的这个机会来阻止德国军国主义复活，并肯定地保证我们的安全。”
    “解放报”着重指出：苏联照会证实了苏联多么重视武装波恩德国的可能后果。法国应当立即决定它的选择；接到建议的各国政府如果规避或拒绝这个建议，决不能不引起舆论的反对。这家报纸认为必须在和东方谈判之前批准伦敦和巴黎协定的这种说法是没有任何实在的理由的。它主张延期举行法国国民议会原定在十二月十日开始的关于批准这些协定的辩论。
    与各民主报纸相反，资产阶级报纸主张对苏联政府的照会作否定的答复。
    “费加罗报”虽然认为有必要同苏联谋求共同的协议，同时却主张拒绝苏联的建议。
    “法兰西晚报”在谈到某些外国报纸扬言即使在巴黎协定获得批准以后苏联政府也愿意进行谈判时说，这种说法“未免过于乐观了”。
    “十字架晚报”在评论苏联照会时说，“尽管波恩官方人士采取冷静的态度”，苏联照会“已经在西德引起震动”。
    “星期日报”说：“苏联这一次不只向三个大国说话，而是向二十三个欧洲国家说话。苏联不仅提出了统一德国这个问题，而且提出了关于整个欧洲安全的更广泛的问题。”
    “世界报”指出：“西方声称苏联将会容忍武装德国，这种说法未免提得太早。”这家报纸表示赞成裁减军备政策。它说：“如果双方都摈弃这条
  （裁减军备的）道路，那么人们将简直不能对和平共处抱有一点点信心。”这个报纸并且说：“我们已经开始认识到，新的军备竞赛将会为整个人类的前途带来怎样的后果。”
      “战斗报”认为：苏联可能会召开只是由那些接受苏联建议的国家参加的会议。报纸说：“那些急忙说这个照会‘没有新的东西’或是把这个照会纯粹看作在目前达到恐吓目的的手腕的观察家们实际上是有点过于急躁了。”
      “巴黎激进新闻”认为苏联照会的目的是召开东欧国家的会议，来建立同北大西洋集团对立的东欧集团。
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：苏联照会在法国某些政界人士中产生了良好的反应。
    国民议会副议长巴列夫斯基（社会共和党）说：
    我认为：拒绝关于召开新的巴黎会议的建议
  “是没有理由的”。巴列夫斯基说，这尤其因为“苏联并没有对考虑集体安全建议的问题提出任何先决条件”。
    国民议会外交委员会主席丹尼埃·麦耶已经表示赞成对苏联照会给予积极的答复。
    “战斗报”指出，苏联建议加强了一些主张在辩论批准伦敦和巴黎协定以前先同苏联谈判的议员们的地位，这些议员对苏联的照会获有深刻的印象。
  “战斗报”说：在这方面起了相当大的作用的，是一部分受戴高乐将军积极支持的社会共和党人和以赫里欧和达拉第为首的一些激进社会党人。
