Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 17th: Farmers in Shandong Province are intensively engaged in winter cultivation. In Huimin, Dezhou, Liaocheng and other regions, winter cultivation started earlier this year. By early November, about 50% of the land scheduled for cultivation had been plowed. In Wudi, Qidong and other counties, 70% of the scheduled land has been plowed. In counties such as Weixian, Changi, and Jiaoxian on both sides of the Jiaoji Railway, an average of about 30% of the scheduled land has been plowed. After harvesting late autumn crops such as peanuts and sweet potatoes, farmers in Wendeng, Rushan, Laiyang and other counties have also followed closely with winter cultivation.

This year, the large-scale development of mutual aid and cooperation organizations in Shandong Province has brought favorable conditions such as more labor and stronger animal power for winter cultivation. The Wang Shiying Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yangtang Village, Tangyi County, used a multi-bottom plow for deep plowing, and all 48 mu of winter cultivated land were plowed to a depth of eight or nine inches. In the Tai'an area, farmers have purchased more than 5,000 double-wheeled double-furrow plows and new-style walking plows in recent years, most of which have been used for winter cultivation, generally to a depth of more than five inches. In Zhao Shengbai Township, Shouzhang County, seventeen agricultural production cooperatives and one mutual aid team used twelve double-wheeled double-furrow plows and nine new-style walking plows, and have plowed more than 1,100 mu of land, generally two inches deeper than in previous years.

Farmers in various parts of Shandong Province are paying close attention to eliminating pests during winter cultivation. In Binjia Township, Huantai County, seventeen mutual aid teams mobilized women and children to pick up insects along the plows. The Xiang Zhengkui Agricultural Production Cooperative in Daying Township, Guangrao County, collected more than 20 jin of bean beetle pupae, grubs, and other pests per mu during winter cultivation.

    山东农民在冬耕中注意深耕除虫
    【新华社济南十七日电】山东省农民正紧张进行冬耕。惠民、德州、聊城等专区，今年冬耕开始较早，到十一月初旬，已耕好应耕地的百分之五十左右。无棣、齐东等县已耕好应耕地的百分之七十。胶济铁路两侧的潍县、昌邑、胶县等县平均已耕好应耕地的百分之三十左右。文登、乳山、莱阳等县农民在收完花生、地瓜（甘薯）等晚秋作物后，也已紧跟着进行冬耕。
    今年山东省由于互助合作组织的大量发展，给冬耕带来了劳力多、畜力强等有利条件。堂邑县杨溏村王世英农业生产合作社用套犁深耕，四十八亩冬耕地全部耕到八、九寸深。泰安专区农民近几年来购置的双轮双铧犁和新式步犁共五千多部，绝大部分都用来进行冬耕，一般深耕到五寸以上。寿张县赵升白乡十七个农业生产合作社和一个互助组，使用十二张双轮双铧犁和九张新式步犁，已耕地一千一百多亩，一般比往年深耕二寸以上。
    山东省各地农民在冬耕中很注意消灭虫害。桓台县滨家乡有十七个互助组发动妇女、儿童跟犁拾虫。广饶县大营乡相正奎农业生产合作社冬耕中每亩地拾豆虫蛹、蛴螬等二十多斤。
