    Eisenhower Administration's "Great Giveaway"

    The American "Nation" weekly, published on October 2nd, devoted an entire issue to exposing the Eisenhower administration's planned "great giveaway" to monopoly capital from various aspects.

    According to incomplete statistics from the "Nation" weekly, during the 608 days from January 1953 to the end of the Congressional adjournment in August this year, the US government, through various "giveaway" methods, increased the income of monopoly capital by $8.1 billion, an average of $13 million per day.

    The US government promotes this "great giveaway" plan in a variety of ways. The "Nation" weekly lists these methods as follows: increasing interest rates on public debt, securities, agricultural product loans, and housing loans, which increased the profits of large banks, insurance companies, and large corporations by $685 million; handing over the oil reserves on the seabed near the coasts of Texas, Louisiana, Florida, and California to oil monopoly capital for exploitation, increasing their income by $3 billion; implementing tax cuts for private utility companies, increasing their profits by $2.8 billion; increasing subsidies for airlines by $2 million; selling synthetic fuel plants at low prices due to the cancellation of supervision, making monopoly capital operating public utilities profit $68.8 million; transferring helium gas production to private enterprises for operation, making them profit $15 million; allowing a private power company to replace the Tennessee Valley Authority, which is operated by the US government, in transmitting electricity in a region, allowing the private power company to gain an income of $140 million; and increasing the profits of capitalists by $1.4 billion through tax system "reforms." In addition, the largest "giveaway" is that the US government, according to the 1954 Atomic Energy Act, allows private capital to operate atomic energy enterprises.

    The "Nation" weekly admits that its estimated "giveaway" figures are the most conservative. It says that, for example, the "giveaway" of atomic energy cannot be measured in dollar figures, and many other small-scale "giveaways" have not been included in the statistics. According to the "Nation" weekly's estimate, exploiting seabed oil will make oil capitalists profit $3 billion, while another American petroleum geologist, Dr. Wallace Pratt, estimates that oil capitalists' income will reach as high as $300 billion!

    The "Nation" weekly pointed out: In the past two years, the US government's "giveaway" plan to monopoly capital has been "unparalleled" in American history. Moreover, in the next two years, this kind of "giveaway" may be even more unscrupulous. The "Nation" weekly said that various materials and enterprises worth $10 billion currently held by the US government or operated by the US government, such as strategic material reserves, munitions factories, atomic equipment, surplus agricultural products, ships, housing equipment, etc., will be "given away" or transferred to private enterprises as soon as possible.

### 艾森豪威尔政府的“大赠送”

    艾森豪威尔政府的“大赠送”
    十月二日出版的美国“民族”周刊，用整整一期的篇幅，从各个方面揭露了艾森豪威尔政府对垄断资本施行有计划的“大赠送”。
    根据“民族”周刊的不完全统计，自从一九五三年一月起到今年八月底国会休会为止的六百零八天当中，美国政府通过各种“赠送”办法，使垄断资本的收入增加了八十一亿美元，平均每天增加一千三百万美元。
    美国政府推行这一“大赠送”计划的方式是多种多样的。“民族”周刊列举这些方式如下：提高公债、证券、农产品贷金和房屋贷金的利息，使大银行、保险公司和大公司的利润增加了六亿八千五百万美元；将得克萨斯、路易斯安那、佛罗里达和加利福尼亚州海岸附近海底的石油蕴藏交由石油垄断资本开采，而使它们增加三十亿美元收入；对私营公用事业公司实行减税，使它们的利润增加二十八亿美元；增加航空公司的补贴金二百万美元；由于取消监督，贱价拍卖人造燃料工厂等等，使经营公用事业的垄断资本获利六千八百万美元；将氦气生产转交给私营企业经营，使它们获利一千五百万美元；准许一家私营电力公司代替由美国政府经营的田纳西水利管理局在一个地区输电，而使这家私营电力公司获得一亿四千万美元收入；通过税制“改革”，使资本家增加利润十四亿美元。此外，最大的一笔“赠送”是，美国政府根据一九五四年原子能法允许私人资本经营原子能企业。
    “民族”周刊承认它所估计的“赠送”的数字是最保守的。它说，例如，原子能的“赠送”就无法以美元数字来衡量，其他很多小规模“赠送”也没有统计在内。依照“民族”周刊的估计，开采海底石油将使石油资本家获利三十亿美元，而另一位美国石油地质学家华莱斯·布拉特博士则估计，石油资本家这笔收入将达三千亿美元之多！
    “民族”周刊指出：两年来，美国政府对垄断资本实行的“赠送”计划，在美国历史上是
  “无与伦比”的。而且，在今后的两年内，这种“赠送”，可能更加肆无忌惮。“民族”周刊说，现在仍在美国政府手中或由美国政府经营的价值一百亿美元的各种物资和企业，如战略物资储备、军火工厂、原子设备、剩余农产品、船只、房屋设备等，都将尽速地“赠送”给或转让给私人企业。（新华社）
