    Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, November 22nd: According to sources in Bangkok, on May 18th of this year, the Thai government unreasonably arrested our compatriots residing in Thailand, He Dingchun, Wang Zhenfeng, Liu Zhuyou, Liao Jinquan, and others, subjected them to torture to extract confessions, and falsely accused them of "extorting money from merchants and secretly remitting it to the mainland, and encouraging young people to return to the mainland for further education." On July 3rd, they secretly escorted He and others to Taiwan, attempting to put them to death.
    The Thai government is intensifying its efforts to fabricate various charges and using various pretexts to persecute our compatriots residing in Thailand. According to reports in Bangkok Chinese newspapers, the Thai Ministry of Education issued an order on July 21st forcing the heads of overseas Chinese schools in Bangkok and Thonburi to dismiss 152 teachers, suspected of engaging in communist activities, by the end of July. Many of these teachers who were forced to resign have been secretly arrested. More than 200 distressed overseas Chinese currently imprisoned in Bangkok are suffering all kinds of torture and extreme pain. Recently, four people died tragically in prison; the families of the victims are in desperate situations. A tragic incident occurred in which the wife of overseas Chinese Gu Fotai painfully sold her son and daughter.
    The Thai government's persecution of overseas Chinese has aroused the indignation of the Chinese people and the broad masses of overseas Chinese.
    Xinhua News Agency, November 22nd: The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China issued a statement of protest on November 22nd regarding the Thai government's persecution of overseas Chinese. The text is as follows:
    The Thai government, disregarding the friendly relations between the Chinese and Thai people, disregarding humanitarian justice, and disregarding international law, unreasonably arrested our compatriots residing in Thailand, He Dingchun, Wang Zhenfeng, Liu Zhuyou, Liao Jinquan, etc., subjected them to severe torture, and fabricated charges against them. On July 3rd, they secretly escorted them to Taiwan, intending to put them to death. The Thai government is also intensifying its efforts to destroy our overseas Chinese education, forcing 152 teachers from overseas Chinese schools in the Bangkok and Thonburi areas to resign, and constantly carrying out secret arrests. We strongly protest against this unreasonable behavior of the Thai government in persecuting overseas Chinese, and solemnly declare that we reserve the right to hold the perpetrators accountable to the Thai government; at the same time, we warn the Thai government that it must stop all acts of persecution against overseas Chinese, otherwise the Thai government must bear all the consequences arising from the persecution of overseas Chinese.

    我华侨事务委员会抗议泰国政府迫害华侨
    【新华社二十二日讯】据曼谷消息：今年五月十八日泰国政府无理逮捕我国侨胞贺顶春、王振枫、刘助友、廖锦泉等，施以严刑逼供，诬指他们“向商家勒索款项，秘密汇至大陆，及鼓励一般青年回大陆升学”，竟于七月三日将贺等秘密押解台湾，企图置他们于死地。
    泰国政府正变本加厉地捏造各种罪名，以各种借口来迫害我国居留泰国的侨胞。据曼谷华文报消息，泰国教育部已于七月二十一日下令迫使曼谷及吞武里府华侨学校负责人，将一百五十二名所谓“有进行共产党活动的嫌疑”的教员于七月底停职。这些被迫辞职的教员已有许多遭到秘密逮捕。目前囚于曼谷监狱中的二百余难侨，正遭受百般磨折，痛苦异常，最近又有四人惨死狱中；被难者家属生活陷于绝境，致使华侨古佛带的妻子忍痛将一子一女出卖的悲惨事件发生。
    泰国政府的这种迫害华侨的行为，引起中国人民和广大华侨的愤慨。
    【新华社二十二日讯】中华人民共和国华侨事务委员会二十二日对泰国政府迫害华侨事发表抗议声明，文如下：
    泰国政府不顾中泰两国人民的友好关系，不顾人道正义，不顾国际公法，竟无理逮捕我国侨胞贺顶春、王振枫、刘助友、廖锦泉等加以严刑酷打、并捏造罪名后，于七月三日秘密押解台湾，置他们于死地。泰国政府还变本加厉地摧残我华侨教育，迫令曼谷及吞武里府地区华侨学校教员一百五十二人停职，并不断进行秘密逮捕。我们对泰国政府这种迫害华侨的无理行为，提出严重抗议，并郑重声明保留向泰国政府追究肇事者的责任的权利；同时正告泰国政府必须停止一切迫害华侨的行为，否则泰国政府必须承担由于迫害华侨所引起的一切后果。
