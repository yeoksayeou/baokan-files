Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, November 18th: Jiangsu Province has surpassed the state plan for grain production this year, with an increase of one billion jin compared to last year.

Following the bumper harvest of summer wheat and other grain crops, the province's autumn harvest of over 30 million mu of rice and 30 million mu of miscellaneous grains has also been successful. Currently, the province's autumn grain crops have been basically harvested, and farmers are rushing to thresh and dry their crops in preparation for selling surplus grain to the state.

Jiangsu Province is a well-known water network area. This year, the water levels of rivers, lakes, and ponds have exceeded the highest levels in recorded history. During the flood season, Party organizations and People's Governments at all levels throughout the province led the farmers in fighting the floods. For the affected fields, accumulated water was promptly drained, and late autumn crops were replanted or switched; measures were also taken to strengthen field management for crop growth deficiencies caused by prolonged cloudy and rainy weather with insufficient sunshine, resulting in a bumper harvest. The Lixiahe area in the lower reaches of the Huai River, which is most prone to disasters, saw an average yield of about 350 jin per mu for its 12 million mu of rice this year, with some areas reaching about 600 jin. In the Taihu Lake water network area, the 10 million mu of rice generally yielded about 500 jin per mu for early and mid-season rice, and about 600 jin per mu for late-season rice. High-yield harvests were also achieved for sorghum, corn, and other crops in the Xuzhou and Huaiyin prefectures over large areas.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 18th: New grain sold by farmers to the state is being continuously transported to Shanghai. Recently, hundreds of wooden boats, large and small, have been taking advantage of the receding tide to sail to more than a dozen grain loading and unloading docks on the Huangpu River and Suzhou Creek; trains transporting grain also arrive daily at Rihui Port Station and Shanghai East Station. Since the late-maturing japonica rice from the Yangtze River Delta region appeared on the market in early November, state-owned retail stores, cooperatives, and private commission shops in Shanghai have been universally supplying the city's six million residents with various types of rice. The new rice is pure white in color and has very few impurities.

From the time new grain generally entered the market last year to the new grain becoming available this year, the state's grain supply to Shanghai residents has been extremely normal. Zhou Jieren, who has been a clerk in a private grain store for more than 20 years, recalled the situation in 1931: that year, there were floods in the Yangtze River basin, and landlords and rich peasants hoarded grain and refused to sell it. The number of ships transporting grain to Shanghai decreased day by day, and when grain ships occasionally arrived in the suburbs of Shanghai, they were looted by hungry crowds. Shanghai grain merchants then raised the price of rice from 11 yuan to 24 yuan per shi. This year, the floods in the Yangtze River basin were even larger than that year, but Shanghai's grain supply has been continuous, and there has been no market fluctuation. Recently, the reporter visited a worker's family in Caoyang New Village. This family has two adults and three children. The worker eats one meal a day at the factory, and about one-tenth of his salary is enough for his family to buy rice. The housewife, Hu Caidi, takes her grain purchase certificate to the designated nearby cooperative once every half month, and the cooperative's salesperson will deliver the rice to her home.

### 江苏省今年粮食增产十亿斤  农民卖给国家的新粮正源源运到上海

    江苏省今年粮食增产十亿斤
    农民卖给国家的新粮正源源运到上海
    【新华社南京十八日电】江苏省今年粮食产量超额完成国家计划，比去年可增产十亿斤。
    继夏熟小麦等粮食作物丰收后，全省秋熟的三千多万亩水稻和三千万亩杂粮作物又获丰收。现在全省秋季粮食作物已基本收完，农民正赶打赶晒，准备出售余粮给国家。
    江苏省是有名的水网地区，今年江、湖、河、荡水位都超出历史上有纪录以来的最高水位。洪水期中，全省各级共产党组织和人民政府领导农民和洪水斗争；对于部分受灾的田亩及时排除积水，补种或改种了晚秋作物；对于因长期阴雨，缺少日照而引起的作物发育不良现象，也采取措施加强了田间的管理，因而获得了丰收。最易受灾的淮河下游里下河地区，今年一千二百万亩水稻平均每亩产三百五十斤左右，多的约六百斤。太湖水网地区一千万亩水稻，其中早稻和中稻一般每亩收五百斤左右，晚稻每亩收六百斤左右。徐州、淮阴等专区的高粱、玉米等作物，也都是大面积的丰收。
    【新华社上海十八日电】农民出售给国家的新粮，源源不断地运来上海。近来，每天有几百只大大小小的木船，趁潮水下落驶到黄浦江和苏州河上十几个装卸粮食的码头；日晖港车站和上海东站每天也有运粮的火车开到。自十一月上旬长江三角洲地区所产的晚熟粳稻见新后，上海市国营零售店、合作社和私商代销店普遍供应六百万市民各类品种的稻米。新米米色洁白，杂质很少。
    从去年新粮普遍上市到今年粮食见新的一年来，国家对上海居民的粮食供应极为正常。在私营粮食商店内当了二十多年店员的周介人回忆一九三一年时的情况说：那年长江流域发生水灾，地主富农把粮食囤起来不卖了，向上海运粮的船只一天天减少，间或有粮船开到上海郊区就被饥饿的人群抢光；上海粮食商人又把米价从每石十一元抬高到二十四元。今年长江流域的洪水比那年更大，上海市的粮食供应却源源不断，市场没有一点波动。日前，记者访问了曹杨新村的一个工人家庭，这家有两个大人三个小孩。这个工人除上工每天在厂里吃一顿饭外，用工资的十分之一左右就足够家里买米的开支了。女主人胡彩弟每半个月拿着购粮证到国家指定的附近合作社去一次，合作社的售货员就会把米送到她家里去。
