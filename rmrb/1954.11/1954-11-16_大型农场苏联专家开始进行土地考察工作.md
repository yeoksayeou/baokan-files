    Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 15th: At the site of the large state-owned grain farm – the Sandaogang area of Jixian County, Heilongjiang Province – a thin layer of snow has already covered the vast wasteland. On the morning of the 13th, the temperature dropped to minus nine degrees Celsius. Five Soviet experts from the land consolidation survey team, responsible for surveying, designing, and planning the farm, accompanied by Chinese personnel assisting the survey team, braved the cold and set out from Xinglong Town to the wasteland for the first inspection. The jeep traveled along the northwest edge of the wasteland, covering approximately one-third of the area. In the areas traversed, no gullies or ridges were encountered. On the same day, the remaining nine Soviet experts from the land consolidation survey team studied the existing data on the natural conditions of the Sandaogang area wasteland at their residence in Xinglong Town. They believe that these data are very valuable for reference when conducting farm surveying, designing, and planning work.
    On the 12th, the heads of local Party and government organs, as well as Chinese soil scientists, hydraulic engineers, and other personnel assisting the survey team, introduced the historical evolution, meteorology, water conservancy, crops, soil quality, and soil distribution of the Sandaogang area wasteland to the Soviet experts of the survey team.

    大型农场苏联专家开始进行土地考察工作
    【新华社哈尔滨十五日电】在大型国营谷物农场场址——黑龙江省集贤县三道岗地区，大片荒地已经盖上了一层薄薄的积雪。十三日早上，气温降到了摄氏零下九度。负责对农场进行勘测、设计和规划工作的土地整理考察组的五位苏联专家，在协助考察组工作的我国工作人员陪同下，冒着寒冷从兴隆镇前往荒地作了第一次的察看。吉普车沿着荒地的西北边缘行进，大约走完了荒地的三分之一。在所走过的地方，没有遇到一条沟或一道岗。同日，土地整理考察组的其余九位苏联专家，在兴隆镇住所研究了现有的有关三道岗地区荒地自然情况的资料。他们认为：这些资料在进行农场勘测、设计和规划工作时很有参考价值。
    十二日，当地党、政机关负责人和协助考察组工作的我国土壤学家、水利工程师等工作人员，曾向考察组苏联专家们介绍了三道岗地区荒地的历史沿革、气象、水利、作物、土质和土壤的分布等情况。
