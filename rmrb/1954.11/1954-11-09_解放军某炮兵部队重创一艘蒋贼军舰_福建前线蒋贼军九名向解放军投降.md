Xinhua News Agency, Zhejiang Front, 6th: A certain artillery unit of the People's Liberation Army on the Zhejiang front heavily damaged a Chiang Kai-shek bandit warship. At 11:43 AM on the 5th, when two Chiang bandit navy "Yong" class minesweepers were sailing from the Dachen Island harbor towards Yijiangshan Island, our People's Liberation Army artillery immediately launched a fierce barrage at the Chiang bandit warships from across the sea. Multiple shells hit one Chiang bandit warship's bridge, both fore and aft, inflicting heavy damage. It fled towards Dachen Island, the base of the Chiang bandit forces. The other Chiang bandit warship also hastily fled south under the heavy bombardment of our army.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhejiang Front, 6th: The leadership of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the Zhejiang Front issued a circular to commend a certain artillery unit for heavily damaging a Chiang bandit warship on the morning of the 5th. The circular encouraged the commanders and fighters of this artillery unit to continue to intensify their study, improve their shooting skills, wound and sink more Chiang bandit warships, defend the motherland's coastal defense, and establish greater meritorious service for the people of the motherland.

Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 6th: Nine Chiang bandit soldiers surrendered to us. At 6:00 AM on the 5th, nine Chiang bandit soldiers sailed in a junk from Jinmen Island southwest towards the sea off Wuyu Island. They waved a white flag and steered their boat towards our coast, surrendering to our People's Liberation Army.
