    Soviet Broadcasting – A Powerful Weapon in the Struggle for Communist Victory
    -- Commemorating the 30th Anniversary of the Official Broadcast of Moscow Radio
    Méi Yì, Director of the Broadcasting Bureau
    I.
    On November 23, 1924, Moscow Radio began its daily broadcasting work. In the history of worldwide radio broadcasting, this was an exceptionally important event.
    Russia is the motherland of radio. In the early days of the establishment of the Soviet regime, radio broadcasting had already become a powerful tool for uniting, mobilizing, educating, and organizing the working masses. As early as November 7, 1917, radio broadcast Lenin's "To the Citizens of Russia," which was the world's first radio broadcast to the people. During the most intense period of the civil war, when the Soviet regime was blockaded and surrounded, Lenin signed several important resolutions requiring Soviet engineers to organize and establish powerful radio stations. The pioneers of Soviet radio technology victoriously completed the tasks given by the Party and Lenin. In 1920, they successfully conducted Europe's first long-distance broadcast; in 1922, they established the world's most powerful radio station in Moscow. Moscow Radio began its daily official broadcasts thirty years ago today.
    Over the past thirty years, Soviet broadcasting has achieved tremendous accomplishments. It has played a huge role in carrying out communist education among the Soviet people, promoting truth to the world, promoting peace, progress, and friendship, and the undertaking itself has reached a massive scale. From 1930 to 1940, the number of national broadcasting stations increased seventeenfold, and wired broadcasting listening devices increased fifty-sixfold. After the war, many new broadcasting stations were built throughout the country, and wired broadcasting also experienced rapid development. Compared with 1940, the number of national broadcasting stations in 1954 increased by one and a half times, and wired broadcasting listening devices increased from 5.84 million to 13.84 million; in addition, there were about 5 million radios. After the September Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee pointed out the need to strengthen rural wired broadcasting, nearly two million wired broadcasting listening devices will be installed in rural areas this year according to plan. This workload is almost double that of last year. According to the development plan, the entire Soviet Union will realize wired broadcasting in the next five or six years. In terms of television, large-screen projection television has been successfully tested, and color television and stereoscopic television will also be formally tested. Soviet scientists are constantly achieving new achievements in applying radio to serve the people, and they have enabled the Soviet Union to occupy an advanced position in the development of radio science and technology worldwide.
    II.
    From the day it began broadcasting, Soviet broadcasting became a powerful weapon to inspire and educate the Soviet people to build a new life and to fight for the victory of communism. In 1939, the CPSU Central Committee said in a congratulatory letter to Soviet broadcasting workers on the occasion of the 15th anniversary of Soviet broadcasting: "It is hoped that broadcasting workers will use all the possibilities given to them by the state to make Soviet broadcasting a more powerful tool for carrying out communist education among the working people and comprehensively improving their cultural level." Soviet broadcasting workers have always actively carried out the tasks assigned to it by the Party, constantly helping the Soviet people to build a communist society and meet the growing cultural demands of millions of listeners.
    Through its daily activities, Soviet broadcasting promotes the excellent moral qualities of Soviet people, cultivates patriotic and internationalist ideological sentiments, promotes Marxism-Leninism, introduces the achievements of science and technology, literature and art, promotes the experience of advanced producers in industry and agriculture, and reports on the achievements of the Soviet people in the struggle to build communism. Soviet broadcasting has the most demanding but also the most sensitive listeners, but the high degree of ideological, artistic, and mass character of broadcasting itself gives it enormous persuasive power and appeal.
    Soviet broadcasting is closely linked to reality, serving the current tasks of the Party and the state. When the Party puts forward new tasks to broadcasting, for example, after the CPSU Central Committee issued a resolution on further developing agriculture last September, Soviet broadcasting repeatedly explained this task to listeners in all programs, mobilized the people in various ways to complete this task, and widely explained how the people of the whole country are working hard to complete the task prescribed by the Party, as well as the new achievements and new experiences they have gained in the process of carrying out the task, and so on. In some literary and artistic programs, in order to reflect this major political task, it also focused on introducing the musical and cultural life of collective farms, specially broadcasting selected music programs for the people who are reclaiming wasteland, and at the same time sent its musical performance groups to carry out patrol performances in the wasteland reclamation areas. The political and literary and artistic programs of Soviet broadcasting, because they are closely linked to the current central tasks, reflect the major issues that workers, peasants, and intellectuals are concerned about, have a high degree of ideological content and combat effectiveness, meet the urgent needs of the broad masses of the people, and therefore powerfully attract and educate listeners.
    Another achievement of Soviet broadcasting is the creation and development of many forms unique to broadcasting. Soviet broadcasting workers are constantly seeking various new broadcasting forms suitable for the characteristics of broadcasting with their creative labor, so that broadcasting programs can have a huge appeal and publicity effect on the broad masses of listeners. Soviet broadcasting has a variety of vivid and lively forms and concise and accurate language, and fully utilizes music and sound effects. Soviet broadcasting programs give full play to the characteristics of broadcasting, are popular, concise, interesting, and make people willing to continue listening to them as soon as they hear them.
    Soviet broadcasting, based on central broadcasting and supplemented by local broadcasting, closely integrates the national broadcasting propaganda into a whole, which strengthens its strength and enables it to more fully meet the growing cultural requirements of the Soviet people, while at the same time powerfully completing the tasks assigned to it by the Party.
    Soviet broadcasting has penetrated the lives of the Soviet people and is increasingly playing its role. "Pravda" gave the following evaluation of the role of Soviet broadcasting: "Among the various weapons for carrying out communist education among the working people, broadcasting occupies a very important position. Broadcasting, in its mass character and in the breadth of its influence, is incomparable to anything else." "Broadcasting has firmly penetrated the lives of our working people. Its role in the political and cultural life of the people is particularly great."
    Soviet broadcasting currently also broadcasts to foreign audiences in thirty-seven languages. People of all countries in the world regard Soviet broadcasting as a source of truth. Soviet broadcasting serves the noble internationalist goals, cooperation and friendship between the people of all countries, and lasting and consolidated peace. Through the barbaric cries of the enemies of peace, through the neurotic cries of the war instigators, Soviet broadcasting transmits the truth to all people who yearn for freedom and peace in a firm and kind voice, and inspires them to fight for peace and democracy.
    This progressive significance and noble goal of Soviet broadcasting, including domestic and foreign broadcasting, is not and cannot be possessed by any capitalist country.
    III.
    The reason why Soviet broadcasting has achieved such great achievements today is first and foremost due to the Soviet Communist Party's attention to and concern for this undertaking. Lenin repeatedly emphasized the great political significance of broadcasting. As early as January 26, 1921, he wrote: "The matter is extremely important. This is a newspaper without paper and without distance, because with the transmitter and radio receiver improved by Baunchi and Bruyevich, the entire Soviet Union will hear the newspaper read in Moscow." In a letter to Stalin and all members of the Politburo on May 19, 1922, Lenin again emphasized: "I think that whether from the point of view of propaganda and agitation or for the purpose of broadcasting study lectures, it is absolutely necessary to implement this plan (i.e., the plan to develop broadcasting), especially for the illiterate masses of residents. In the situation where the professors of social sciences from bourgeois origins, who still account for the majority and whom we allow to exist, are completely unsuitable or even harmful, we have no other way to think of except to let our few communist professors who are good at teaching social sciences broadcast lectures to hundreds of cities scattered throughout the republic. Therefore, I think that under no circumstances should we be stingy with money in thoroughly completing the radio broadcasting undertaking and manufacturing truly applicable loudspeakers." When Stalin spoke about the importance of broadcasting and film at the 15th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1927, he also said: "These most important tools should be in our hands. Transfer the shock troops among the true Bolsheviks to this undertaking and let them victoriously expand this undertaking."
    Soviet radio broadcasting thus laid the foundation for Soviet modern radio technology in the years of the civil war and laid the foundation for the development of radio technology in the first five-year plan under the care and leadership of the Soviet Communist Party and Lenin and Stalin. And now, it has become an undertaking armed with the most advanced technology and possessing powerful equipment and a broad mass base. On the other hand, the Soviet Communist Party is also constantly concerned about the political, ideological, and artistic level of broadcasting programs. The CPSU Central Committee has made many resolutions to improve broadcasting work. Each resolution has greatly improved the quality of Soviet broadcasting programs. The Party's care and leadership is the decisive force for the great achievements of Soviet broadcasting today. Lenin's ideal about radio broadcasting has now been brilliantly realized in the Soviet Union.
    The glorious course of Soviet broadcasting over the past thirty years has powerfully inspired and guided us. China's young broadcasting workers warmly celebrate the great achievements of Soviet broadcasting over the past thirty years and take it as our best example to learn from.

    苏联广播——为共产主义胜利而斗争的强大武器
    ——纪念莫斯科广播电台正式播音三十周年
    广播事业局局长　梅益
    一
    一九二四年十一月二十三日，莫斯科广播电台开始了它逐日的播音工作。在全世界无线电广播事业的历史上，这是一个异常重要的事件。
    俄国是无线电的祖国。在苏维埃政权建立的初期，无线电广播就已成为团结、动员、教育和组织劳动群众的强有力的工具。远在一九一七年十一月七日，无线电就广播了列宁的“告俄罗斯公民书”，这是全世界第一次向着人民的无线电广播。在内战最剧烈、苏维埃政权被封锁包围的时期，列宁曾签署了几个重要的决议，要求苏维埃工程师们组织和建立强大的广播电台。苏维埃无线电技术的先辈胜利地完成了党和列宁所给予的任务。他们在一九二○年成功地进行了欧洲第一次远距离的广播；一九二二年在莫斯科建立了当时世界上最强大的广播电台。莫斯科广播电台在三十年前的今天，开始了它逐日的正式的广播。
    三十年来，苏联广播已获得了巨大的成就。它在向苏联人民进行共产主义教育，向全世界宣传真理，宣传和平、进步和友谊中发挥了巨大的作用，而事业本身也已具备了极大的规模。从一九三○年到一九四○年，全国广播站增加了十七倍，有线广播收听工具增加了五十六倍。战后，全国建设了许多新的广播电台，无线电化事业也有了飞跃的发展。和一九四○年相比，一九五四年全国广播站增加了一倍半，有线广播收听工具由五百八十四万个增加到一千三百八十四万个；此外，还有约五百万个收音机。苏共中央九月全会指出必须加强农村无线电化工作之后，今年按计划将在农村装设将近二百万个有线广播的收听工具。这个工作量几乎等于去年的两倍。按照发展计划，全苏联将在今后五六年内实现无线电化。在电视事业方面，大银幕投影的电视已经试验成功，彩色电视和立体电视也将正式试验。苏维埃科学家们在应用无线电为人民服务方面，正不断获得了新的成就，他们已使得苏联在全世界无线电科学和技术的发展中，占有先进的地位。二
    苏联广播从它开始播音的那一天起，就成为鼓舞、教育苏联人民建设新生活，为共产主义胜利而斗争的强大武器。一九三九年，联共中央在庆贺苏联广播十五周年给苏联广播工作者的贺信中曾说：“希望广播工作者利用国家给与他的一切可能，使苏联广播成为向劳动人民进行共产主义教育和全面地提高他们的文化水平的更强有力的工具。”苏联广播工作者一直积极地执行着党为它所规定的任务，不断地帮助苏联人民去建设共产主义社会，满足千百万听众日益增长的文化要求。
    苏联广播通过它每天的活动，宣扬苏维埃人的优秀的道德品质，培养爱国主义和国际主义的思想感情，宣传马克思列宁主义思想，介绍科学和技术、文学和艺术的成就，推广工农业先进生产者的经验，报道苏联人民在建设共产主义的斗争中所已取得的成就。苏联广播有着最苛求的同时也是最富于感受力的听众，但是广播本身的高度的思想性、艺术性和群众性，使它具有巨大的说服力和感染力。
    苏联广播是密切联系实际，为党和国家的当前任务服务的。当党向广播提出了新的任务，例如在去年九月苏共中央发布了关于进一步发展农业的措施的决议之后，苏联广播就在一切的节目中向听众反复阐明这个任务，用各种方式动员人民去完成这个任务，广泛地说明全国人民如何为完成党所规定的这个任务而努力，以及他们在执行任务过程中所获得的新的成就和所创造的新的经验等等。在一些文艺性的节目中，为反映这个重大的政治任务，它还集中地介绍了集体农庄的音乐文化生活，为开垦荒地的人们特别播送精选的音乐节目，同时派出了它的音乐表演团体到开荒地区作巡逻的表演。苏联广播的政治性和文艺性节目，由于紧密地联系着当前的中心任务，反应着为工人、农民、知识分子所关心的重大问题，都具有高度的思想性和战斗性，都符合广大人民群众的迫切需要，因而也都有力地吸引了和教育了听众。
    苏联广播的另一个成就，是创造了和发展了许多为广播所特有的形式。苏联广播工作者不断地以其创造性的劳动，寻求各种各样的、适合于广播特点的新的广播形式，使广播的节目能够对广大听众产生巨大的吸引力和宣传作用。苏联广播具有多种多样的、生动活泼的形式和简洁准确的语言，并且充分地利用了音乐和音响。苏联广播的节目是充分发挥了广播的特点的，是通俗的、简短的、有趣味的、一听就愿意继续听下去的。
    苏联广播以中央广播为基础，以地方广播为补充，将全国的广播宣传密切结成一个整体，这就加强了它的力量，使它能更充分地满足苏联人民日益增长的文化要求，同时又有力地完成了党所交给它的任务。
    苏联广播已深入苏联人民的生活，并日益发挥它的作用。“真理报”对苏联广播的作用，曾给予这样的评价：“在向劳动人民进行共产主义教育的各种武器中，广播占着很重要的地位。广播在它的群众性上，在它的影响的广泛上，是没有东西能同它相比的。”“广播已巩固地深入我国劳动人民的生活中。它对人民的政治、文化生活所起的作用，特别巨大。”
    苏联广播目前还以三十七种语言向国外听众播音。世界各国人民，把苏联广播当作真理的泉源。苏联广播是为高尚的国际主义目的、为各国人民间的合作和友谊、为持久的和巩固的和平服务的。穿过和平敌人的野蛮的叫嚣，穿过战争挑拨者的神经质的哭泣，苏联广播以坚定的亲切的声音，把真理传播给所有渴望自由和和平的人民，并鼓舞他们为争取和平和民主而奋斗。
    苏联广播，包括对内的和对外的广播所具有的这种进步的意义和高尚的目标，是任何一个资本主义国家所没有也不可能有的。三
    苏联广播事业之所以获得今天这样巨大的成就，首先是由于苏联共产党对这一事业的重视和关怀。列宁曾不止一次地强调过广播的巨大的政治意义。他在一九二一年一月二十六日，就曾写道：“事情是无比重大的，这是不用纸和没有距离的报纸，因为有了包恩奇、布路也维奇所改良的放送器和收音机，全苏联都将听到在莫斯科诵读的报纸。”在一九二二年五月十九日，列宁在给斯大林和全体政治局委员的信中，又强调地说：“我想，无论从宣传鼓动的观点来看，无论是为了播送学习讲座，都有实现这个计划（按即发展广播的计划）的绝对必要性，特别是对于不识字的居民群众来说。在仍占多数的我们所准许存在的资产阶级出身的社会科学教授完全不能适用甚至还有害的情况之下，除了让我们善于讲授社会科学的少数共产主义者教授，给散处共和国各方的数百个城市播送讲座之外，我们再没有别的办法可想了。因此我想，无论在任何情况下，在彻底完成无线电广播事业，并制造真正适用的扩音器方面，不应该吝惜金钱。”斯大林一九二七年在联共（布）第十五次代表大会上讲到广播和电影的重要性时，也曾说过：“应该把这些最重要的工具掌握在手里。把真正的布尔什维克中的突击队员调到这种事业中去，让他们去胜利地扩大这种事业。”
    苏联无线电广播事业就这样在苏联共产党的和列宁、斯大林的关怀和领导下，在内战年代奠定了苏维埃现代无线电技术的根基，在第一个五年计划时期打下了无线电技术发展的基础，而现在，它已成为以现代最先进的技术武装起来的、具有强大的设备和广泛的群众基础的事业了。另一方面，苏联共产党又不断地关心广播节目的政治、思想、艺术水平。苏共中央曾为改进广播工作，做出了许多的决议。每一次决议都大大地提到了苏联广播节目的质量。党的关怀和领导，是今天苏联广播获得如此巨大成就的决定力量。列宁关于无线电广播的理想，现在已光辉地在苏联实现了。
    苏联广播三十年来的光辉历程，一直有力地鼓舞和指引着我们。中国年青的广播工作者热烈地庆贺苏联广播三十年来所获得的巨大成就，并以它作为我们最好的学习榜样。
