    Ministry of Food Sends Work Groups to Various Regions to Understand Grain Unified Purchase Situation
    The Ministry of Food of the People's Republic of China has organized five work groups, which departed on the 11th to the Northeast, Northwest, East China, Central South, and Southwest regions to understand and grasp the progress of grain unified purchase work. These work groups are led by cadres at the level of nine division and bureau chiefs or above. They will go deep into grassroots districts and township purchasing points to conduct on-site inspections, widely listen to the opinions of cadres at all levels and the people, and comprehensively understand the production, consumption, surplus, and shortage of grain in rural areas. For the areas affected by floods in the Yangtze River and Huai River basins, they will focus on understanding the grain shortage situation in order to organize transportation, arrange supply forces, and support the people in the disaster areas to restore production. The work groups will also exchange opinions with the grain departments of various provinces on the work connection after the abolition of the greater administrative region organizations, improving business management, and gradually institutionalizing unified purchase and sales.
