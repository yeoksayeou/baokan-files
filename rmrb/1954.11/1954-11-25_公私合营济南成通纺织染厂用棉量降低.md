    Lower Cotton Consumption at Joint State-Private Jinan Chengtong Textile and Dyeing Factory
    The Joint State-Private Jinan Chengtong Textile and Dyeing Factory, which had long exceeded the state's cotton consumption quota, reduced its cotton consumption per yarn piece in October to below the new state target, saving enough raw cotton to spin twelve more pieces of yarn for the state.
    The Chengtong Textile and Dyeing Factory became a joint state-private enterprise in June of this year. Before the joint state-private operation, due to poor management, the cotton consumption per yarn piece was consistently above 400 jin (last year's average was 402.03 jin per piece, and 401.06 jin from January to June this year). Only after the implementation of the joint state-private operation in June did it begin to gradually decrease. However, from January to September of this year, each piece of yarn still required 399.88 jin of cotton. Calculated based on the original state target of 395 jin, a total of 82,950 jin of medium-grade cotton was wasted in nine months, enough to spin 210 pieces of yarn. In October, the staff and workers of the Chengtong Textile and Dyeing Factory launched a production increase and economy campaign, achieving good results. According to October statistics, the cotton consumption per yarn piece dropped from the average of 399.88 jin in January to September to 390.37 jin, which is 2.63 jin lower than the new state target of 393 jin, saving a total of 5,310 jin of medium-grade cotton.

    公私合营济南成通纺织染厂用棉量降低
    用棉量长期以来超过国家指标的公私合营济南成通纺织染厂，十月份每件纱通扯用棉量已下降到国家新的指标以下，为国家节约了可纺十二件纱的原棉。
    成通纺织染厂是在今年六月份开始公私合营的。在公私合营前，由于经营管理不善，每件纱用棉量长期在四百斤以上（去年全年每件纱通扯四百零二点零三斤，今年一至六月份四百零一点零六斤），到今年六月份实行公私合营后，才开始逐步下降，但是今年一至九月份每件纱还要用棉三百九十九点八八斤，按照国家原规定指标三百九十五斤计算，九个月共浪费中级棉八万二千九百五十斤，可纺纱二百一十件。十月份，成通纺织染厂职工开展了增产节约运动，取得了良好的效果。据十月份统计，每件纱通扯用棉量，已由一至九月份平均三百九十九点八八斤，下降到三百九十点三七斤，比国家新指标三百九十三斤还低二点六三斤，共节约了五千三百一十斤中级棉。　（张啸白）
