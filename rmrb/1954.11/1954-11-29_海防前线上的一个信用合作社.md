    A Credit Cooperative on the Coastal Defense Front
    Wuyu Island, on the Fujian coastal defense front, faces off across the sea with Jinmen Island, occupied by Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops. More than 240 fishing families live on this island. Recently, they have been continuously subjected to intrusions and harassment from Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops' aircraft and artillery, which has affected production and made life more difficult than before.
    The cadres of the island's credit cooperative, in order to help the fishermen solve their difficulties in production and life, continue to persevere in their work, regardless of the threat of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops' aircraft and artillery. The directors of the credit cooperative went deep among the fishermen to understand the living conditions of the members. Comrade Cai Long, the accountant, carried account books and cash on his back to deliver money to the fishermen in need in a timely manner. A few days ago, they had already issued 5 million yuan in loans to help 46 fishing families solve their living difficulties. The credit cooperative also organized a "mobile condolence service team" to visit the fishermen evacuated from Wuyu Island to places such as Shima and Gangwei. This team visited 28 fishing families in Shima alone and lent 700,000 yuan in loans to eight fishing families with living difficulties.
    The activities of the credit cooperative have further encouraged the fishermen's will to fight against the enemy. The Zeng Chengjia family of eight experienced difficulties in life due to the harassment of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops. The credit cooperative provided timely loans to help them overcome their difficulties. Later, Zeng Chengjia voluntarily helped a communications soldier of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army to deliver a letter to another island. As soon as the boat left the shore, it was harassed by Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft, but he still rowed bravely and calmly, and finally successfully completed the task. Fishermen such as Cai Lian, who were evacuated to Shima, also expressed to the mobile condolence service team of the credit cooperative that they would contribute manpower and boats to resolutely support the liberation of Taiwan!

    海防前线上的一个信用合作社
    福建海防前线的浯屿岛同蒋贼军盘踞的金门岛隔海对峙着。这个岛上居住着二百四十多户渔民。近来，他们不断受到蒋贼军飞机、炮火的侵袭和骚扰，生产受到影响，生活也比以前困难了。
    岛上信用合作社的干部，为了帮助渔民解决生产和生活上的困难，不顾蒋贼军飞机、炮火的威胁，继续坚持工作。信用合作社的理事们分别深入到渔民中去了解社员的生活情况。会计蔡龙同志便背着帐簿和现款，及时地把钱送到有困难的渔民手里。前些日子，他们就已经发放了五百万元贷款，帮助四十六户渔民解决了生活困难。信用合作社还组织了一个“流动慰问服务组”，到石码、港尾等地去慰问从浯屿岛疏散到那里的渔民。这个组在石码一个地方就慰问了二十八户渔民，借给生活困难的八户渔民七十万元贷款。
    信用合作社的活动更加鼓舞了渔民们对敌斗争的意志。渔民曾成家全家八口人，因为蒋贼军骚扰，生活发生了困难，信用合作社及时贷款给他们，帮助他们把困难克服了。后来，曾成家自动帮助解放军某部的通讯员到另一个岛上去送信。船一离岸，就遭到蒋贼飞机的骚扰，他仍然勇敢、镇定地划船，终于胜利地完成了任务。疏散到石码的渔民蔡恋等也向信用合作社的流动慰问服务组表示：要人出人，要船出船，坚决支援解放台湾！（林小峰）
