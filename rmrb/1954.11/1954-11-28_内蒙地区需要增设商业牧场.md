To the Editor:

    Since the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region implemented comprehensive management of the sales and transportation of major livestock (cattle, horses, sheep, mules), herders have been freed from the exploitation of private merchants and are selling large numbers of cattle, sheep, horses, and mules to the state at reasonable prices. The local food company originally planned to purchase over 90,000 head of cattle throughout the region this year, but in October alone, it purchased more than 40,000 head, accounting for about 50% of the annual purchase plan. Recently, the number of livestock entering the market has continued to increase. It is estimated that by the end of the year, the actual purchase figure will exceed the original plan by about 40%.

    After purchasing a large number of livestock, the food company cannot immediately allocate them for export or slaughter them all. Instead, they must be raised in a concentrated manner for planned arrangements. Especially since the implementation of comprehensive management of the sales and transportation of major livestock and the clearing of pastures, the livestock sold by herders to the food company are not limited to those suitable for slaughter and export, but also include more old, weak, disabled, and female animals, as well as a large number of breeding and draught animals. In addition to state-owned commercial departments and cooperatives finding ways to allocate and transport these breeding and draught animals, the remaining ones need to be properly raised and sold next spring. This presents the food company with a serious task—it must adapt to the new situation, add fixed pastures to graze these livestock, and ensure that they do not lose weight or die.

    The current serious problem is the lack of such pastures. In areas where livestock are concentrated, such as Baotou, Pingdiquan, and the western regions of the Ikh Ju League, there are no fixed commercial pastures. The existing pastures are very small and not fixed, and essential wintering facilities for livestock, such as sheds and pens, cannot be established in a planned manner. This results in a serious loss of state wealth. In Baotou and Pingdiquan alone, there are currently about 20,000 head of cattle and 40,000 head of sheep stored. Because there is no grassland for grazing, they have to be driven from the eastern suburbs to the western suburbs in the morning and back from the western suburbs to the eastern suburbs in the afternoon.

    As a result, the phenomenon of livestock losing weight is very serious, and there are even deaths.

    Inner Mongolia's existing pastures are no longer able to meet the needs of business development. If this problem is not resolved quickly, it will inevitably directly affect the completion of livestock purchase and supply tasks; and next spring, farmers and herders will also not be able to buy satisfactory, fat, and strong livestock.

    In order to solve the problem of commercial pastures in areas where livestock are concentrated, such as Baotou, Pingdiquan, Hohhot, and the Ulanqab League and Ikh Ju League, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Commercial Department has repeatedly requested instructions from the Inner Mongolia Finance and Economics Committee, and also raised the issue at the First Session of the First People's Congress of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (held in July and August). Although the Finance and Economics Committee has tried in many ways, so far, except for Hohhot and the Ulanqab League government, which have preliminarily promised but not formally designated areas, other regions have not yet resolved the problem.

    Now that the weather is getting colder day by day, quickly handling and allocating pastures to ensure the safe overwintering of livestock is a major issue related to the state's meat supply task and also related to the long-term interests of herders. It is hoped that the relevant leaders of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region will carefully plan, consult in many ways, and quickly designate the locations and areas of pastures for state-owned commercial departments under the conditions that do not affect pastoral production and are conducive to the country's construction cause.

### 内蒙地区需要增设商业牧场

    内蒙地区需要增设商业牧场编辑同志：
    内蒙古自治区自从对主要牲畜（牛、马、羊、骡）的运销实行全面管理以来，牧民们已经摆脱了私商的剥削，以合理的价格把大批的牛、羊、马、骡卖给国家。这里的食品公司原来计划今年在全区收购牛九万多头，可是仅十月份一个月，便购进了四万多头，占全年收购计划百分之五十左右。近来，牲口上市量仍有增无已，估计到年底，实际收购数字将要超过原计划百分之四十。
    食品公司在收购了大批的牲畜之后，并不能立刻调拨出口，或全部屠宰，而是要集中饲养起来，以便有计划地安排。特别是对主要牲畜的运销实行全面管理和清理牧场以来，牧民卖给食品公司的牲口，不仅限于可供屠宰和出口的，而且老、弱、残、母畜也多了，还有大量的养畜和耕畜。这些养畜和耕畜除了由国营商业部门和合作社设法调剂运销外，剩下来的需要妥为饲养，等到明年春暖时再卖出去。这就给食品公司提出了一个严重的任务——必须适应新的情况，增设固定的牧场，放牧这些牲畜，保证它们不至于掉膘和死亡。
    当前严重的问题就在于缺少这类牧场。在牲畜上市集中的地区如包头、平地泉、伊克昭盟等西部地区，都没有固定的商业牧场。原有的牧场很小，又不固定，牲畜过冬所不可缺少的棚、圈等保温设备，也无法有计划地建立。这就造成国家财富的严重的损失。仅包头和平地泉两地，目前就共储存约二万头牛和四万头羊。因为没有草地可供放牧，只好把它们上午从东城郊赶到西城郊，下午又从西城郊赶回东城郊。
    这样，牲口的掉膘的现象很严重，甚至也有死亡的。
    内蒙的现有牧场已经不能适应业务发展的需要，这个问题如不尽速解决，势必直接影响牲畜收购和供应任务的完成；而明年春暖时农牧民也将买不到称心如意的、肥大强壮的牲畜。
    为了解决包头、平地泉、呼和浩特和乌兰察布、伊克昭二盟等牲口集中地区的商业牧场问题，内蒙古自治区商业部早就一再请示过内蒙古财政经济委员会，并在内蒙古自治区第一届人民代表大会第一次会议上（七、八月间开的）提出过，财政经济委员会虽在多方设法，但至今除呼和浩特和乌兰察布盟政府已初步允诺但未正式划定地区外，其他地区到现在还没有解决。
    现在，天气一天天冷了，迅速处理和调拨牧场，让牲畜安全过冬，是关系着国家肉食供应任务而且也关系着牧民长远利益的重大问题。希望内蒙古自治区有关领导方面慎重计划，多方协商，在不影响牧区生产又有利于国家建设事业的条件下，迅速给国营商业部门划出牧场的地点和面积。奔森
