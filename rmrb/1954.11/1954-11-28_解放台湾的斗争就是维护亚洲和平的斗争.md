    The Struggle to Liberate Taiwan is a Struggle to Safeguard Asian Peace

    On November 16th, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles publicly stated at a press conference that the United States is now closer than ever to signing a "bilateral common security treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. This is a grave provocative act by the American imperialists against the Chinese people.
    It is well known that Washington has been plotting this "bilateral treaty" for a long time. For a long time, the American bourgeois newspapers and news agencies have not concealed the purpose of the U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group's alliance
  "treaty" conspiracy, which is to find a hypocritical legal excuse to turn Taiwan into a U.S. colony forever and a base for further interference in our country's internal affairs. A United Press International dispatch on August 17 stated that U.S. officials admitted that concluding a "treaty" with Chiang Kai-shek would first "obligate the United States to protect the government of this island," and then further consider combining Japan, Syngman Rhee, and Chiang Kai-shek "into a single alliance with the U.S. government." This shows that the U.S. ruling clique is planning to intensify military adventures against the People's Republic of China through the U.S.-Chiang "treaty." The Chinese people obviously cannot sit idly by.
    Taiwan is an inalienable and sacred part of the People's Republic of China. This is a matter of course and an undeniable fact. In Taiwan, there is still the remnant group of Chiang Kai-shek, a butcher who has relied on imperialism and massacred the Chinese people for decades. The Chinese people must liberate Taiwan, eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang that owes blood debts, and save the Taiwanese compatriots who are in deep water. This is an inevitable matter that belongs purely to China's internal affairs, and no one has the right to interfere. At the same time, because the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group is a tool supported by American imperialist bayonets and serves American aggression against China, this shows that the Chinese people's liberation of their sacred territory of Taiwan and the elimination of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group is an effective step in restraining American aggression and safeguarding peace in the Far East.
    In order to prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, the American imperialists and their accomplices have tried their best to deceive world public opinion and carry out intimidation, saying that the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan will worsen the situation in the Far East and risk the outbreak of an international war. In fact, it is precisely because the United States occupies our territory of Taiwan and uses Taiwan as a military base for attacking the Chinese mainland that the situation in the Far East has deteriorated. As for trying to use intimidation to make the Chinese people give up their sacred duty of liberating Taiwan, that is simply a self-deceiving trick of the imperialists. The Chinese people, steeled in the struggle for liberation, cannot be intimidated. If the American aggressive clique disregards the legitimate rights and interests of the Chinese people and dares to act willfully, then it must bear the responsibility for all serious consequences.
    Today, there are some people who pretend to make gestures, trying to make people believe that the American occupation of China's territory of Taiwan does not cause any harm to the Chinese people, nor does it pose any threat to world peace. The British "Sunday Times" on November 7 believed that if the "treaty" concluded between the U.S. and Chiang only "guarantees the defense of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands," then it could become a "possible basis for future reconciliation," and it is said that "this is a solution that would be supported by Britain." Undoubtedly, this statement is actually a reproduction of the appeasement policy towards the American aggressors. These gentlemen keep saying that their "suggestions" are to ease the tense situation in the Far East, but people cannot help but ask: Isn't the only way to ease the tense situation in Asia to let the American aggressors who came from afar withdraw from Taiwan and withdraw from Asia?
    The facts are clear. Today, the root cause of the tense situation in the Far East and Asia is the American aggression in Asia, and the American ruling clique is unwilling to see the Chinese people's liberation and has adopted an aggressive policy of continuing to be hostile to the Chinese people. Therefore, only by liberating Taiwan and crushing the aggressive conspiracy of American imperialism can there be a reliable guarantee for peace and security in the Far East. The Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan is a struggle to safeguard peace in the Far East.
    The Chinese people must liberate the sacred territory of their motherland, Taiwan, and resolutely eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group. No force can stop the Chinese people from completing this glorious task. If the American aggressors attempt to further collude with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group and fight against the great Chinese people to the end, then a shameful defeat awaits them, and no other future is possible.

    解放台湾的斗争就是维护亚洲和平的斗争
    冯之丹
    十一月十六日，美国国务卿杜勒斯在记者招待会上公开说，美国现在已比过去任何时候都更接近于同蒋介石卖国集团签订“共同安全双边条约”。这是美帝国主义者对中国人民的严重挑衅行为。
    人们知道，华盛顿对于这个“双边条约”的阴谋策划已久。长久以来，美国资产阶级的报刊及通讯社，都不掩饰美国和蒋介石卖国集团缔结同盟
  “条约”阴谋的目的，是想找个虚伪的法律上的借口，把台湾永远变成美国的殖民地和进一步干涉我国内政的基地。合众社八月十七日的电讯更说，美国官员们承认，同蒋介石订立“条约”，首先“由美国承担保护这个岛屿政府的义务”，然后便进一步考虑把日本、李承晚和蒋介石“跟美国政府结合在一个单一的联盟中。”这就说明，美国统治集团是在打算通过美蒋“条约”来加紧部署对中华人民共和国的军事冒险。中国人民显然绝对不能坐视。
    台湾是中华人民共和国的神圣领土的一部分，这是天经地义、无法抹杀的事实；在台湾，今天还盘据着过去数十年中投靠帝国主义、屠杀中国人民的刽子手蒋介石残余集团。中国人民要解放台湾，消灭欠下血债的蒋介石匪帮，拯救水深火热中的台湾同胞，这是势在必行的、纯粹属于中国内政问题的事，任何人都无权加以干涉。同时，由于蒋介石卖国集团是在美帝国主义刺刀支持下、为美国侵略中国服务的工具，这就说明：中国人民解放自己祖国的神圣领土台湾、消灭蒋介石卖国集团，乃是克制美国侵略、维护远东和平的有效步骤。
    为了阻止中国人民解放台湾，美帝国主义及其帮手们竭力欺骗世界舆论，并实行恫吓，说中国人民解放台湾，就会使远东局势恶化，且有爆发国际战争的危险。事实上，正是由于美国侵占我国领土台湾，并利用台湾作为进攻中国大陆的军事基地，才使远东局势恶化。至于想用恫吓来使中国人民放弃解放台湾的神圣职责，那简直是帝国主义者自欺欺人的把戏。在解放斗争中百炼成钢的中国人民是吓不倒的。如果美国侵略集团无视中国人民的合法权益、敢于一意孤行，那么，它就得承担一切严重后果的责任。
    今天，有那么一些人假惺惺地作出姿态，企图使人相信：似乎美国侵占中国领土台湾对中国人民没有什么危害，也不会对世界和平造成任何威胁。十一月七日的英国“星期日泰晤士报”就认为美蒋缔结的“条约”如果只是“保证保卫台湾和澎湖列岛”，那末，就可以成为什么“将来和解的一个可能基础”，而据说，“这是一个会得到英国支持的解决办法”。毫无疑问，这种说法实际上是对美国侵略者的姑息和“绥靖”政策的翻版。这些先生们口口声声地说，他们的“建议”是为了要缓和远东紧张局势，但是人们不禁要问：难道不是只有让那不远万里而来的美国侵略者退出台湾、退出亚洲去，才是缓和亚洲紧张局势的唯一途径吗？
    事实是明白摆着的。今天远东和亚洲紧张局势的根源就是美国在亚洲的侵略，就是美国统治集团不甘于中国人民的获得解放，而采取继续与中国人民为敌的侵略政策。因此，只有解放台湾，粉碎美帝国主义的侵略阴谋，才是远东和平和安全的可靠保障。中国人民解放台湾的斗争，就是维护远东和平的斗争。
    中国人民一定要解放自己祖国的神圣领土台湾，坚决消灭蒋介石卖国集团。没有任何势力能够阻止中国人民完成这一光荣任务。如果美国侵略者企图同蒋介石卖国集团进一步勾结起来，同伟大的中国人民作对到底，那末，可耻的失败正等待着他们，任何别的前途是不可能有的。
