    Recovering 4.6 Billion in Losses
    On October 30th, the Liaoning Daily published a front-page headline titled "Shenyang Municipal Tax Bureau Earnestly Handles People's Letters, Significantly Reducing National Tax Revenue Losses." The news reported that after the Shenyang Municipal Tax Bureau rectified its work in handling people's letters and visits last year and established systems such as "Bureau Director's Reception Day for People's Visits," it greatly strengthened its connection with the people and improved work efficiency. Last year, the bureau received a total of 14,990 letters from the people (including visits), of which reports of illegal private merchants evading taxes accounted for 92.3 percent of the total number of letters, enabling the state to recover 3.411461 billion yuan in evaded taxes. From January to September this year, the number of letters (including visits) increased by 49 percent compared to the same period last year, with letters reporting illegal private merchants evading taxes increasing by 39.9 percent, enabling the state to recover an additional 1.195983 billion yuan in evaded taxes. The criticisms and suggestions in the people's letters regarding the tax work and the work style of tax officials also played an important role in improving the bureau's work.
    The news is not long. But these figures and facts alone powerfully illustrate the tremendous significance of earnestly handling people's letters for safeguarding the interests of the state and the people, and for improving and enhancing our work.
    However, not all staff members of state organs fully recognize this significance. On the contrary, many units still treat the work of handling people's letters with a bureaucratic and formalistic attitude. While praising the Shenyang Municipal Tax Bureau, the Liaoning Daily also pointed out this in its editorial titled "Correctly Treat the Work of People's Letters and Visits" and criticized some incorrect thoughts and practices.
    The editorial revealed the following facts: Leading cadres of the Shenyang Municipal State-Owned Commercial Bureau never accepted people's letters. The bureau has no one specifically responsible for this work, resulting in serious backlogs and loss of letters. Of the 139 letters received from the people last year, the whereabouts of which are still unknown. The newspaper described their pattern of handling people's letters as: "move only when urged," "no urging, no moving," and even "no moving even when urged." The section chief of the Medical Prevention Section of the Shenyang Municipal Health Bureau even attributed the reason for not completing the task in the first quarter to too many people's letters. He also told his colleagues, "Don't accept people's letters." The newspaper pointed out that treating people's letters with such a bureaucratic attitude will inevitably lead our state organs to become detached from the masses, work to lose supervision, and loopholes to emerge everywhere. Therefore, it requires leaders of party and government organs at all levels to educate their staff to attach importance to this work, to wage an irreconcilable struggle against the bureaucratic style of ignoring people's letters, and to earnestly inspect the handling of people's letters to ensure that every letter from the people is handled promptly and properly.
    Relying on the people, maintaining close contact with the masses, listening to the opinions of the masses, and accepting the supervision of the masses are fundamental principles stipulated in the Constitution for all state organs to carry out their work. And earnestly handling people's letters and visits is an important link in implementing this principle. The Liaoning Daily, through persuasive examples and necessary analysis and criticism, brings this issue to the public forum, which will further ensure that this issue is correctly resolved.　　(Yiren)

    挽回四十六亿的损失
    在十月三十日辽宁日报的一版头题地位，登出了题为“沈阳市税务局认真处理人民来信，国家税收损失大量减少”的消息。消息说：沈阳市税务局去年整顿了处理人民来信来访的工作，制定了局长“接待人民来访日”等制度以后，大大密切了同人民群众的联系，提高了工作效率。去年该局共收到人民来信（包括来访）一万四千九百九十件，其中检举不法私商偷税漏税行为的占来信总数百分之九十二点三，使国家收回被偷漏的税款三十四亿一千一百四十六万一千元。今年一至九月，来信（包括来访）数量较去年同期增加了百分之四十九，其中检举不法私商偷税漏税行为的信件增加了百分之三十九点九，使国家收回被偷漏的税款增加了十一亿九千五百九十八万三千元。人民来信中对税务工作和税务工作人员作风上的批评建议，对改进该局的工作也起了重要的作用。
    消息并不长。但仅是这些数字和事实，就已经有力地说明了：认真处理人民来信，对维护国家和人民的利益，对改进和提高我们的工作，有着多么巨大的意义。
    但是并不是所有的国家机关工作人员都充分认识到这种意义的。正相反，不少单位还是以官僚主义和形式主义的态度对待人民来信的工作。辽宁日报在表扬沈阳市税务局的同时，就在题为“正确对待人民来信来访工作”的社论中指出了这一点，并对一些不正确的思想和作法进行了批评。
    社论中揭露了以下的事实：沈阳市国营商业局的领导干部从不受理人民来信。该局没有专人负责这一工作，因而造成严重的积压和丢失来信的现象，去年收到的人民来信一百三十九件，至今未查明下落。报纸描述他们处理人民来信的规律是：“催一催动一动”，“不催不动”，甚至是“催也不动”。沈阳市卫生局医疗预防科的科长，竟把第一季度没有完成任务的原因推之于人民来信过多，他还告诉科里的同志“不要收人民来信”。报纸指出用这样官僚主义的态度对待人民来信，必将使我们的国家机关脱离群众，工作失去监督，漏洞百出。因此，它要求各级党政机关的领导人教育所属工作人员重视这一工作，向漠视人民来信的官僚主义作风进行不调和的斗争；并认真检查处理人民来信的情况，以保证每一封人民来信都得到及时妥善的处理。
    依靠人民群众，经常保持同群众的密切联系，倾听群众的意见，接受群众的监督，这是宪法中规定的一切国家机关进行工作的一个根本原则。而认真处理人民来信来访，又是贯彻这一原则的一个重要环节。辽宁日报通过富有说服力的例子和必要的分析批判，把这个问题提到群众论坛上来，将会使这个问题进一步得到正确的解决。　　（毅人）
