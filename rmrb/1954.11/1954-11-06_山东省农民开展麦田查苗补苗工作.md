Shandong Province farmers are carrying out wheat field seedling inspection and replenishment work. During the wheat sowing period this year, due to early drought, some areas rushed to sow in moisture-deficient soil, resulting in rough cultivation. Later, due to continuous rain, some sown wheat rotted due to waterlogging. In addition, the prevention and control of underground pests was not widespread enough, leading to varying degrees of missing seedlings and broken rows in many wheat fields. According to inspections in some counties and districts of Linyi, Tai'an, Jining, and Dezhou prefectures, many wheat fields are missing seedlings by about 20%.

Party and government leading organs in various regions, based on past experience in protecting seedlings and the different reasons for missing seedlings and broken rows this year, promptly mobilized the masses of farmers to carry out seedling inspection and protection work. According to statistics from eight districts in six counties, including Gaotang and Laiwu, more than 18,600 mu have been replanted or re-sown. In the six southern districts of Ju County, 2,636 mu of wheat fields were missing seedlings. By October 20, 1,764 mu had been replanted and 84 mu had been re-sown. In the fifteenth district of Fei County, 6,471 mu of wheat fields were missing seedlings due to underground pests. 5,036 mu had been replanted, 324 mu had been re-sown, and all had been treated with poisoned grain. In areas where soil locusts occurred, control measures were also being taken. Xintai and Shou Zhang counties organized more than 8,000 people to catch more than 1,700 jin of soil locusts in more than 5,660 mu of wheat fields. Farmers in the eighth district of Zhanhua County collected more than 70,000 jin of wild vegetables, plus 15,000 jin of wheat bran allocated by the People's Government, and mixed them into poisoned bait to control more than 20,000 mu of soil locusts, ensuring normal growth of wheat seedlings.

    山东省农民开展麦田查苗补苗工作
    山东省各地开展麦田查苗补苗工作。今年小麦播种期间，由于前期干旱，部分地区抢墒播种，耕作粗放；后期因连绵阴雨，部分播种小麦受涝霉烂，加之地下虫害的防治工作还不够普遍，以致不少麦田呈现不同程度的缺苗断垄现象。据临沂、泰安、济宁、德州等专区部分县、区的检查，许多麦田缺苗达百分之二十左右。
    各地党政领导机关，根据以往保苗工作的经验，和今年缺苗断垄的不同原因，及时发动农民群众开展了查苗保苗工作。据高唐、莱芜等六个县的八个区的统计，已完成补种和翻种一万八千六百多亩。莒县南六个区缺苗麦田共二千六百三十六亩，到十月二十日已补种一千七百六十四亩，翻种了八十四亩。费县十五区因地下虫害而缺苗的六千四百七十一亩麦田，已补种了五千零三十六亩，翻种了三百二十四亩，并全部施用了毒谷。在发生土蝗的地区也抓紧进行了除治。新泰、寿张两县组织了八千余人，在五千六百六十多亩麦田中，捕捉了一千七百多斤土蝗。沾化县八区农民群众，采集了野菜七万多斤，加上人民政府拨给的麦麸一万五千斤，配合做成毒饵，防治了两万余亩的土蝗，保证了麦苗正常生长。
