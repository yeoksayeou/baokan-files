    Congratulations on the 37th Anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution
    Telegram from Qian Junrui, Secretary-General, to Chairman Denisov of the Council of the Soviet Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries in Moscow:
    On the occasion of the 37th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, I extend the warmest congratulations on behalf of all members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association to the great Soviet people who are victoriously engaged in communist construction.
    The care of the Soviet government and people for our construction undertakings and the great, selfless, and comprehensive assistance they have given to us over the past five years have greatly encouraged and strengthened the confidence of the Chinese people in striving to build a socialist society. The Chinese people sincerely thank the Soviet Union for its assistance.
    In order to realize our country's first Five-Year Plan, ensure the gradual success of our country's socialist construction, and safeguard peace in Asia and the world, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association will continue to work hard to further consolidate and develop the great friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union, strengthen Sino-Soviet cultural exchanges, and promote the nationwide study of the advanced experience of Soviet socialist construction.
    Long live the great, permanent, and unbreakable friendship between China and the Soviet Union!
    Qian Junrui, Secretary-General of the National Headquarters of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association
