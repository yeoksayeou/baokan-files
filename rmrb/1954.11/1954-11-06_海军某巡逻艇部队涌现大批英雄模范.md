Xinhua News Agency, Zhejiang Front, 5th: A naval patrol boat unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has seen the emergence of a large number of heroic and model figures and collective merit-winning units in the past five years while completing its coastal defense combat missions. Among the heroic and model figures, four have been awarded the title of Hero or Model of the East China Navy, and two have been awarded the title of Model of the Naval Base; in addition, nine hundred and eighteen people have been credited with meritorious service. Among the units credited with collective meritorious service, there is the No. XX boat, which won the title of "Toumenshan Sea Battle Hero Boat," and two boat squadrons and two boats were each awarded the collective second-class merit, and eleven units and departments were awarded the collective third-class merit.

Over the past five years, this patrol boat unit, together with other naval vessels and the army and air force, has achieved remarkable results in escorting ships, protecting fisheries, and liberating coastal islands, and has continued to grow and strengthen through combat training. According to incomplete statistics, in the past five years, this patrol boat unit has fought a total of sixty-seven battles against the Chiang Kai-shek bandit navy, covered and cooperated with the army in twenty-three battles to liberate coastal islands, captured forty-five Chiang bandit military boats and vessels, sunk six Chiang bandit military boats and vessels, wounded fifteen Chiang bandit military warships and boats (including four Chiang bandit military warships), shot down and damaged four Chiang bandit military aircraft, killed and wounded one hundred and nineteen Chiang bandit soldiers, and captured two hundred and twelve Chiang bandit guerrilla troops. In addition, they also cooperated with the army to kill, wound, and capture more than one thousand Chiang bandit soldiers.

In the past battles, the commanders and combatants of this patrol boat unit created many heroic examples of naval warfare. Commander Chen Lifu has repeatedly made meritorious contributions in battle, and has been wounded several times without leaving the front line. He commanded the boat squadron to sink a large Chiang bandit military sailing ship, kill more than thirty Chiang bandit soldiers, and protect the safe fishing of more than one thousand fishing boats. Therefore, Chen Lifu was awarded the glorious title of Combat Hero of the East China Navy. On September 11th last year, the "Toumenshan Sea Battle Hero Boat" and another boat severely damaged a Chiang bandit military gunboat while escorting a batch of cargo ships and fishing boats, and safely reached their destination.

    海军某巡逻艇部队涌现大批英雄模范
    据新华社浙江前线五日电：中国人民解放军海军某巡逻艇部队，五年来在完成海防斗争任务中涌现了大批英雄模范人物和集体立功单位。在英雄模范人物中，有四人荣获华东海军英雄或模范称号，两人荣获海军基地模范称号；另有九百十八人立了功。在荣立集体功的单位中，有荣获“头门山海战英雄艇”的某号艇，另有两个艇队和两艘艇各立了集体二等功，有十一个单位和部门立了集体三等功。
    五年来，这一支巡逻艇部队和其他舰艇以及陆、空军部队一起，在护航、护渔和解放沿海岛屿的战斗中获得了显著的战绩，并在实战锻炼中不断成长壮大。据不完全统计，五年来这支巡逻艇部队先后对蒋贼海军共作战六十七次，掩护和配合陆军部队解放沿海岛屿作战二十三次，俘获蒋贼军艇船四十五艘，击沉蒋贼军艇船六艘，击伤蒋贼军舰、船十五艘（其中击伤蒋贼军舰四艘），击落、击伤蒋贼飞机四架，击毙、击伤蒋贼军一百十九名，俘获蒋贼游杂部队二百十二名。此外，还配合陆军部队击毙、击伤和俘获蒋贼军一千多名。
    在历次战斗中，这支巡逻艇部队的指挥员、战斗员创建了许多海战的英雄事例。指挥员陈立富在战斗中屡建功勋，曾数次负伤不下火线，指挥艇队击沉蒋贼军大型机帆船一艘，击毙蒋贼军三十多名，保护了一千多艘渔船安全捕鱼。因此，陈立富荣获了华东海军战斗英雄的光荣称号。去年九月十一日，“头门山海战英雄艇”同另一艘艇在护送一批货船和渔船时，重创了蒋贼军炮艇后，安全地到达了目的地。
