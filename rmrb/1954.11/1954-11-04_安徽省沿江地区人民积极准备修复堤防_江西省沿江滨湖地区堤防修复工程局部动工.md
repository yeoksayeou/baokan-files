The preparation work for the river and embankment dike repair projects in the thousand-mile area along the Yangtze River in Anhui Province is proceeding actively. The provincial dike restoration work conference concluded at the end of October, and the dike restoration headquarters has been established in Wuhu City. The Yangtze River Downstream Engineering Bureau and more than a dozen surveying teams affiliated with the Anhui Provincial Department of Water Resources are heading to the construction sites for surveying. Telephone lines to each embankment dike are being erected. To ensure the quality of the project, thousands of grassroots cadres who are in charge of engineering construction and acceptance are about to begin training. Grain and grass, oil and salt supply stations to be set up are soon to be established on the river and embankment dikes. During the repair of the embankment dikes, the grain departments and commercial departments will supply more than 200 million catties of grain and 300 million catties of firewood.

This year, the total earthwork for the Yangtze River dike restoration project in Anhui Province is more than 100 million cubic meters. Calculated on the basis of 100 working days, nearly one million workers will be on the dikes every day. The Wuwei Dike, which is related to more than 4 million mu of farmland in eight counties and one city, is one of the key points of the entire Yangtze River dike restoration project. The project requires ensuring that it will not be breached by the largest flood in nearly a century, and even never be breached. The Ma'anshan River Dike, which is related to the production of the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant, and the Fourteen-Lian Embankment, Dangtu First Embankment, Second Embankment, which are related to the transportation of the Huainan and Ningwu Railways, as well as the Tongma Dike, Dagong Embankment, and Guangji Embankment, which protect more than 100,000 mu of farmland, are also listed as key dike restoration projects in the province. The project requires raising the dikes above or level with the highest flood level in 1954 to ensure that the dikes will not be breached by floods as large as this year. The repair projects of other river and lake dikes are also required to ensure that they will not be breached by floods like those of 1949 or 1931. (Xinhua News Agency)

    Xinhua News Agency: Large-scale embankment dike repair projects in the along-the-Yangtze River and lakeside areas of Jiangxi Province have partially begun. More than 50,000 workers are now working on the dikes every day. According to the plan of the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government, the total amount of earthwork for the embankment dike repair project this winter and next spring will reach more than 40 million cubic meters (including annual maintenance projects). The total length of the embankment dikes to be repaired will reach more than 2,000 kilometers. The entire project will require more than 400,000 workers to work for 70 days. These projects will all be completed this winter and next spring, in order to create a strong guarantee for the agricultural production of these along-the-Yangtze River and lakeside areas—Jiangxi Province’s main grain-producing areas—next year.

Recently, all parts of Jiangxi Province along the Yangtze River and lakeside areas have vigorously carried out preparatory work for repairing embankment dikes. Counties along the Yangtze River and lakeside areas have successively established leadership and command organizations for repairing embankment dikes. The surveying work of the Ganjiang River East Bank, the East and West Banks of the Fu River, and the Twenty-Four-Lian Embankment of Xinjian County, etc., has been completed. Nanchang, Xinjian, Jinxian, Gao'an, Jiujiang, Yongxiu, Ruichang, Poyang and other counties have also trained more than 900 technicians and more than 700 ramming workers.

Relevant departments in Jiangxi Province have mobilized a large amount of manpower and materials to support this project. The Jiangxi Provincial People's Government Health Department has mobilized more than 1,000 medical personnel to carry out medical and health work among the dike-repairing workers. The Nanchang County Health Hospital has also organized medical stations to provide services to the workers on the dikes. In order to ensure the grain supply of a large number of workers, the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government Grain Department plans to set up special supply stations in places where workers are concentrated and far away from the original grain supply stations, and assign special personnel to be responsible for the supply. Since October 16th, the Poyang County Supply and Marketing Cooperative has organized 300 bamboo weavers to rush to make dirt baskets and bamboo sheds, and has prepared more than 38,000 catties of pig iron to cast tools for the workers to repair embankment dikes.

    安徽省沿江地区人民积极准备修复堤防
    江西省沿江滨湖地区堤防修复工程局部动工
    安徽省沿长江两岸千里地区的江、圩堤修复工程的准备工作，正在积极进行。全省复堤工作会议已在十月底结束，复堤指挥部已在芜湖市成立，长江下游工程局与安徽省水利厅所属的十几支测量队正纷赴工地进行测量，通到各圩堤的沿江电话线路开始架设。为保证工程质量，数千名掌握工程施工和验收等工作的基层干部即将开始训练，计划要设立的粮草、油盐等供应站即将在江、圩堤上设立，粮食部门和商业部门在修复圩堤期间将要供应两亿斤以上的粮食和三亿斤以上的柴草。
    今年安徽省长江复堤全部工程土方为一亿多立方公尺，按一百天工作日计算，每天上圩的民工近百万人。关系着八个县和一个市四百多万亩农田的无为大堤，列为整个长江流域复堤的重点之一，工程要求保证遇到近百年来的最大洪水不溃破，以至永不溃破。关系着马鞍山铁厂生产的马鞍山江堤和淮南、宁芜两条铁路运输的十四连圩、当涂第一圩、第二圩以及保障农田在十万亩以上的同马大堤、大公圩、广济圩等圩堤也列为全省的复堤重点。工程要求提高超过或平于一九五四年最高洪水位，确保像今年这样大洪水不溃堤。其余的河堤湖堤的修复工程也都要求遇到像一九四九年或一九三一年的洪水确保不破。　（新华社）

    江西省沿江滨湖地区大规模圩堤修复工程已经局部动工。现在每天有五万多民工上堤工作。根据江西省人民政府的规划，今冬明春圩堤修复工程土方总量达四千多万公方（包括岁修工程），修复圩堤的总长度达二千多公里，整个工程需要四十多万民工劳动七十天。这些工程都将在今冬明春完成，以便给这些沿江滨湖地区——江西省的主要产粮区明年的农业生产造成有力的保障。
    最近以来，江西省沿江滨湖各地已经大力进行了修复圩堤的准备工作。沿江滨湖各县都先后成立了修复圩堤的领导和指挥的机构。赣江东岸，抚河东、西两岸，新建县二十四联圩等圩堤的测量工作已经完成。南昌、新建、进贤、高安、九江、永修、瑞昌、鄱阳等县还训练了九百多个技术人员和七百多个硪工。
    江西省各有关部门都动员了大批人力、物力来支援这个工程。江西省人民政府卫生厅调动了一千多个医务人员在修堤民工中作医疗卫生工作，南昌县卫生院并组织了医疗站到堤上为民工服务。江西省人民政府粮食厅为了保证大批民工的粮食供应，准备在民工集中和离原有粮食供应站较远的地方专门设立供应站，指派专人负责供应，鄱阳县供销合作社从十月十六日起就组织了三百个篾工赶制土箕、篾棚，并准备了三万八千多斤生铁，以便给民工们铸造修复圩堤的工具。　（新华社）
