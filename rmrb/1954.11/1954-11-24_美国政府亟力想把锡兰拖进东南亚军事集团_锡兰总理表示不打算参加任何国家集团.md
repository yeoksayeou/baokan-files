Xinhua News Agency, 22nd: Washington dispatch: The United States is preparing to use Ceylonese Prime Minister Kotelawala’s visit to the United States in December as an opportunity to try to pull Ceylon into the Southeast Asian military bloc.

According to United Press reporter Hansley on the 17th, Washington officials admitted that during Kotelawala’s visit to the United States, American authorities may discuss with him the possibility of Ceylon joining the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. U.S. officials hope that Ceylon can at least establish contact with the "economic cooperation aspect" of the Southeast Asia Treaty. At the same time, U.S. authorities are also preparing to discuss with Kotelawala the issue of granting Ceylon economic and technical "aid." Hansley's report reveals that Washington wants to use "U.S. aid" to threaten and lure Ceylon into expressing its willingness to join the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

Hansley pointed out that the U.S. State Department, in a recent background publication describing its political objectives for Ceylon, made it clear that the United States "hopes that Ceylon will play a more active role in collective defense measures in South Asia and Southeast Asia."

Xinhua News Agency, 23rd: London dispatch: Ceylonese Prime Minister Kotelawala, on his way to the United States, arrived in London from Paris on the evening of the 19th for a week-long visit.

According to Reuters, Kotelawala said upon arriving in London: "We do not approve of the formation of national blocs, nor do we intend to join any national bloc." He said: "We do not want to stand idly by or take a detached attitude. We hope to be in a position where we can bring everyone together and prevent conflict."

He believes that efforts must be made to create a consensus for peaceful purposes, sit down and talk to each other, in order to promote greater friendship among all countries and eliminate the fears and suspicions that separate them.

    美国政府亟力想把锡兰拖进东南亚军事集团
    锡兰总理表示不打算参加任何国家集团
    【新华社二十二日讯】华盛顿消息：美国准备利用锡兰总理科特拉瓦拉十二月间访问美国的机会，设法把锡兰拉进东南亚军事集团。
    据合众社记者汉斯莱十七日报道，华盛顿官员们承认，在科特拉瓦拉访问美国期间，美国当局可能和他讨论锡兰参加东南亚条约组织的可能性。美国官员希望锡兰至少能和东南亚条约的“经济合作方面”建立联系。同时，美国当局还准备和科特拉瓦拉讨论给予锡兰以经济和技术“援助”的问题。汉斯莱的报道透露，华盛顿想利用“美援”对锡兰进行威胁利诱，要锡兰表示愿意参加东南亚条约组织。
    汉斯莱指出，美国国务院在最近的一份背景刊物中叙述它对于锡兰的政治目标时明白表示：美国“希望锡兰在南亚和东南亚的集体防务措施中起更为积极的作用”。
    【新华社二十三日讯】伦敦消息：锡兰总理科特拉瓦拉在他去美国途中，在十九日晚从巴黎到达伦敦，作为时一星期的访问。
    据路透社报道，科特拉瓦拉在到达伦敦时发表谈话说：“我们不赞成组成国家集团，我们也不打算参加任何国家集团。”他说：“我们并不想袖手旁观或抱超然态度，我们是希望处于我们能够使大家共处和防止冲突的地位。”
    他认为：必须设法创立和平目的的一致，坐下来彼此进行会谈，借以在所有国家中促成更大的友谊和消除使各国分开的恐惧和怀疑情绪。
