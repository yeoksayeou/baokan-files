Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 19th. By the end of October, workers at the state-owned Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant had overfulfilled the annual production increase and savings plan of 100 billion yuan by 66 percent.

　　In ten months, the total value of increased production at the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant reached 118.2 billion yuan, product costs were reduced by more than 30 billion yuan, and more than 16 billion yuan in working capital was saved. Due to the completion of the production increase and savings plan, the actual profits turned over to the state by the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant from January to October this year were 38.6 billion yuan more than the state-mandated task. After the completion of the new production increase and savings plan, the plant’s profits turned over to the state this year will reach 112.9 percent of the state plan. In the past three weeks, all employees of the plant have launched an intense labor competition to achieve the new production increase and savings plan. Workers in rolling steel, iron smelting, electric furnace steelmaking and other departments have enriched the content of the competition and launched competitions between individuals and groups. All departments are generally checking the implementation of suggestions from Soviet experts and further strengthening technical management. During the inspection, the workers of the thin plate department conscientiously implemented the recent suggestion from Soviet experts to move the finishing mill roller back 15 millimeters, and overfulfilled the production plan for the first half of November. Iron smelters are also trying to reduce the proportion of coke to below 0.9. Workers in the refractory materials department continue to vigorously implement the use of hard coal instead of coking coal for kiln firing. After the implementation of this measure, it is estimated that 400 million yuan can be saved by the end of the year.

    太原钢铁厂超额完成全年增产节约计划
    【新华社太原十九日电】到十月底为止，国营太原钢铁厂的职工已经超额百分之六十六完成了全年增产节约一千亿元的计划。他们并计划在今年最后两个月，再给国家增产节约一百四十亿元。
    十个月中，太原钢铁厂增产总值达一千一百八十二亿元，降低产品成本三百多亿元，节省流动资金一百六十多亿元。由于增产节约计划的完成，太原钢铁厂今年一月到十月实际上缴给国家的利润，比国家规定的任务多三百八十六亿元。新的增产节约计划完成以后，这个厂今年上缴给国家的利润将达到国家计划的百分之一百十二点九。最近三周以来，全厂职工为了实现新的增产节约计划，展开了紧张的劳动竞赛。轧钢、炼铁、电炉炼钢等部门的职工都充实了竞赛的内容，展开了人和人、组和组之间的竞赛。各部门都在普遍检查对苏联专家建议的执行情况，进一步加强技术管理。薄板部的职工们在检查中认真贯彻了最近苏联专家提出的把完成机轧辊移后十五米厘的建议，超额完成了十一月上半月的生产计划。炼铁工人们也正在设法把焦炭的比例降低到零点九以下。耐火材料部的工人们继续大力贯彻用硬煤代替炼焦煤烧窑。这一项措施实施以后，估计到年终可以节省四亿元。
