Six Hundred Million People – The Great Strength of Our Socialist Construction
Bai Jianhua

The results of the 1953 population census have been officially announced. Announcing the population figure of our great motherland – 601,938,035 people – is a major event of historical significance. A comprehensive and accurate count of the population of our great motherland is the foundation for counting all of our country’s assets, and it is also the basis for organizing the cause of socialist construction. In our country, as in the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, "people" are the most valuable capital of all kinds, and "people" are the masters of their own destiny and the conscious creators of their own happy lives.

According to historical records, calculations of population numbers existed in our country as far back as four thousand years ago. By the time of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, a system of population statistics based on Baojia was established. The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Beiyang Warlord Government and the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Kuomintang Government also counted the population and conducted surveys in several provinces. However, because the main purpose of population surveys by the feudal dynasties of the past, as well as by the Beiyang Warlord Government and the Kuomintang Government, was for taxation and conscription, and the survey and statistical objects were mainly adult males serving and paying taxes, the people always tried to avoid such surveys and statistics in every possible way. Therefore, the question of how many people our great motherland actually had was a problem that had never been correctly resolved in history, nor could it be. The figure of 400 million people was counted by the Manchu Qing government 119 years ago. The figure of 475 million was announced by the Kuomintang government in 1931 based on the household survey results of the "Republic of China" in 1928. At that time, only a portion of the provinces were surveyed, and the figures for the remaining provinces were estimated and fabricated. When the People's Republic of China was founded, the figure of 475 million was temporarily adopted. Later, with the progress of various tasks, governments at all levels obtained relatively accurate population statistics through land reform and production construction. From the beginning of 1950 to the end of 1952, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government compiled six national population figures based on reports from the people's governments of various provinces and cities, in consultation with relevant central departments. From the first compilation of 483 million to the last compilation of 575 million, each increased, gradually approaching the actual figure. However, because a scientific census had not been conducted, it was not announced.

The population survey and registration conducted in 1953 in conjunction with grassroots elections was carried out based on China's current actual situation and by drawing on the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. Before the survey, a practical survey plan was formulated, standard times for the survey were stipulated, permanent and non-permanent populations were clearly distinguished, simple and easy-to-implement survey items and methods were uniformly stipulated, and a national population survey conference was held for detailed discussion, and more than 2.5 million registration personnel were organized and trained. During the survey, the active elements of the vast grassroots governments were mobilized to assist. Practice in various places has proved that the various measures of this population survey are not only practical and convenient for the masses, but also relatively scientific under the current conditions, and thus have achieved good results.

Since this population survey was conducted in conjunction with grassroots elections, and the principles of subordination to production and convenience to the masses were adopted, the assistance of Party and government leading organs and election committees at all levels was obtained, and the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of the people was also obtained. In the survey, a working method of piloting at each level and advancing steadily was adopted, ensuring that the population survey work gradually improved on the basis of continuously absorbing experience and overcoming shortcomings. And because of the universal emphasis on review and verification and supplementary registration and reporting, the difficulties and errors caused by the postponement of grassroots elections and the extension of the survey registration time were basically overcome, ensuring the accuracy of the registration. According to the results of sampling inspections conducted by the Central Population Survey and Registration Office and population survey and registration offices at all levels in several regions, it was proved that the population survey and registration work in various places basically met the requirements of "comprehensive and accurate." According to the results of a nationwide sample survey of more than 52.95 million people, repeated population accounted for 1.39 per thousand, and omissions accounted for 2.55 per thousand. These figures show that although the first population census of New China was not able to completely avoid repeated omissions due to lack of experience and long time, it reflected China's population figures most accurately compared with any previous population survey conducted in our country.

This population survey and registration work was carried out in stages and batches over a period of nearly one year, from preparation to completion, on nearly 10 million square kilometers of land. This was a very arduous task, a cause that the feudal dynasties of the past and the Kuomintang reactionary government had undertaken many times but failed to complete. The completion of this cause is not only due to the scientific nature and practicality of the survey and registration methods, not only due to our carrying out a series of tasks such as conscientious training of cadres, in-depth publicity and mobilization, meticulous survey and registration, careful review and verification, and supplementary registration and reporting, but more importantly because the purpose of New China's population survey is to protect the people's democratic rights and carry out socialist construction, is for the people, and therefore can obtain the active support of the broad masses of the people. This is precisely the manifestation of the superiority of the people's democratic system, which is unthinkable for reactionary regimes.

According to the results of this survey, China's population is over 600 million, accounting for one-quarter of the world's total population. These more than 600 million industrious and brave Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, are building their own motherland and defending their own motherland with unparalleled enthusiasm, which not only shows that our country has a strong force for building socialism, but also shows that our country has a strong force for defending peace in Asia and the world.

During the era of Kuomintang reactionary rule, China's birth rate was not low compared with other countries in the world; however, due to the harsh living conditions of the people and the unrest in social order, the death rate was high, and the natural population growth rate was relatively low. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, according to typical survey materials from several domestic academic institutions and the Kuomintang government, the natural population growth rate in China at that time was generally around 10 per thousand. In the few years since liberation, due to the restoration and development of production, the improvement of people's lives, and the progress of medical and health care, China's death rate has dropped sharply, and the natural population growth rate has significantly increased. According to statistics from the Ministry of Internal Affairs on 29 large and medium-sized cities, the entire province of Ningxia, and a county in each of ten other provinces, a district in 35 counties, two towns, 58 townships, and seven villages, totaling more than 30.018 million people, China's current birth rate averages 37 per thousand, the death rate averages 17 per thousand, and the natural growth rate averages 20 per thousand.

Due to China's nascent industrial production, the proportion of the urban population is relatively small. Since liberation, due to the rapid recovery and development of industry and commerce, the urban population has seen a significant increase. In 1953, the permanent population of cities across the country (excluding floating population and temporary residents) increased by more than 40 percent compared with the total population of cities across the country in 1950. Many industrial and mining cities such as Anshan, Fushun, Benxi, Fuxin, Hegang, Tangshan, and Taiyuan have more than doubled their population compared with 1950, and some have increased by more than three times. At the beginning of China's large-scale socialist construction, the speed of urban population increase has been fully demonstrated.

According to the age statistics of more than 574.2 million people directly surveyed and registered, infants and young children under one to four years old born in the five years since liberation accounted for 15.6 percent of the total population, and the ratio of men to women has approached equilibrium. Children aged five to nine accounted for only 11 percent of the total population, and there were more boys than girls, a very disparate situation. This shows that children, both boys and girls, living in the Mao Zedong era have received normal childcare and happy lives, and the era of poverty, disease, ignorance, and the frequent drowning and abuse of baby girls is over.

Labor is the creator of all wealth. Bourgeois economists cling to the bankrupt Malthusian "population theory," are startled to hear that China has more than 600 million people, and declare that China will have no way to feed these more than 600 million people, even fabricating the absurd rumors that China will inevitably "invade abroad." Such fallacies are clearly not worth refuting. We acknowledge that in an economically underdeveloped country, rapid population growth may cause some difficulties in life. But our country has vast uncultivated land and abundant resources to be developed, and most importantly, the superiority of our social system guarantees that we can continuously develop the national economy. The rate of growth of China's industrial and agricultural production in recent years has obviously far exceeded the rate of population increase, and thus the gradual improvement of the people's lives is fully guaranteed. When our socialist construction is completed, our country will, like the Soviet Union, completely eliminate unemployment and underemployment, and ensure that all the people can enjoy a happy life.

Today, when our country is carrying out large-scale socialist construction, clarifying the population figures of our great motherland allows us to clearly grasp the labor resources and service objects for building socialism, so that we can have a reliable basis for the unified allocation of labor in urban and rural areas, the planned supply of means of production and means of subsistence for the people in urban and rural areas, the unified purchase and sale of grain and edible oil, the facilities of cultural and educational and health institutions, the planning and construction of cities, and a series of other political, economic, and cultural measures for the people and relying on the people. Therefore, this population survey is of great significance to our construction of socialism. However, the population is constantly changing, and a nationwide population survey cannot be held every year. Therefore, all localities should establish a regular household registration system on the basis of this population survey and registration in order to keep abreast of changes in household registration at any time and continue to provide accurate population data for the country's various construction projects.

    六万万人——我国社会主义建设的伟大力量
    白建华
    一九五三年人口调查登记的结果正式公布了。公布我们伟大祖国的人口数字——六亿零一百九十三万八千零三十五人，这是具有历史意义的一件大事。全面而精确地统计我们伟大祖国的人口，是统计我们伟大祖国的全部财产的基础，也是组织社会主义建设事业的依据。在我们国家如同在苏联和其他人民民主国家一样，“人”是各种资本中最宝贵的资本，“人”是自己命运的主宰和自己幸福生活的自觉创造者。
    据历史记载，远在四千年以前，我国就有了人口数目的计算。到满清时代，建立了按保甲进行人口统计的制度，北洋军阀政府内务部和国民党政府内政部，也曾统计过人口，并且在几个省份进行过调查。但是由于历代的封建王朝以及北洋军阀政府和国民党政府人口调查的主要目的是为了课税和征兵，调查统计的对象也主要是服役和纳税的成年男子，人民对这种调查统计总是想尽各种办法来逃避，因此我们伟大祖国人口究竟有多少，是历史上一直没有正确解决也不可能正确解决的一个问题。四亿人的数字，是一百一十九年前满清政府统计的。四亿七千五百万的数字，则是一九三一年国民党政府根据“民国”十七年户口调查的结果宣布的。当时调查过的只有一部分省份，其余各省的数字都是估计和臆造的。中华人民共和国成立时，暂时沿用了四亿七千五百万这个数字。以后随着各项工作的进展，各级人民政府通过土地改革和生产建设等各项工作，都较为确实地统计了人口。中央人民政府内务部从一九五○年初至一九五二年底，根据各省、市人民政府的报告，经同中央各有关部门研究，共汇编了六次全国人口数字。从首次汇编的四亿八千三百万到末次汇编的五亿七千五百万，每次都有增加，逐渐接近实际。但因没有经过一次科学的普查，所以没有公布。
    一九五三年结合基层选举举办的人口调查登记，是根据我国当前的实际情况和吸取了苏联的先进经验而进行的。调查之前，曾制定了切合实际的调查方案，规定了调查的标准时间，明确划分常住人口和非常住人口，统一规定了简单易行的调查项目和调查方法，而且召开全国人口调查会议进行详细的讨论，并组织和训练了二百五十余万登记人员。调查中，曾经动员了广大基层政府的积极分子来协助进行。各地的实践证明，这次人口调查的各项措施不仅切实可行，便利群众，而且在目前条件下也是比较科学的，因而收到了良好的效果。
    由于这次人口调查是同基层选举结合进行的，采取了服从生产、便利群众的原则，所以取得了各级党政领导机关和选举委员会的协助，也得到了广大人民的热诚拥护。调查中采取了层层试点、稳步前进的工作方法，保证了人口调查工作在不断吸取经验、克服缺点的基础上逐步提高。并且由于普遍地重视了复查核对和补登补报工作，所以基本上克服了由于基层选举推迟和调查登记时间延长所引起的困难和差错，保证了登记的准确性。根据中央人口调查登记办公室和各级人口调查登记办公室在若干地区进行抽查的结果，证明各地人口调查登记工作，基本上达到了“全面确实”的要求。根据全国范围内抽查五千二百九十五万以上的人口的结果，重复的人口占千分之一点三九，遗漏的人口占千分之二点五五。这些数字说明，新中国第一次人口普查虽然由于经验不足，时间较长，重复遗漏的差错还未能完全避免，但和我国历史上所进行的任何一次人口调查相比，则是最正确地反映了中国的人口数字。
    这次人口调查登记工作，是在近一千万平方公里的土地上，从准备到完成经过将近一年的时间分期分批进行的。这是一件十分艰巨的工作，是我国历代封建王朝和国民党反动政府办了很多次而没有办成的事业。这一事业的完成，不仅是由于调查登记办法的科学性和切合实际，不仅是由于我们进行了认真的训练干部、深入的宣传动员、细致的调查登记、缜密的复查核对以及补登补报等一系列的工作，更主要的是由于新中国人口调查的目的，是为了保障人民的民主权利和进行社会主义建设，是为了人民，因而能够取得广大群众的积极拥护和支持。这正是人民民主制度的优越性的表现，这是反动政权所不能设想的。
    这次调查结果，我国人口在六亿以上，占全世界总人口的四分之一。这六亿多勤劳勇敢的中国人民，正在中国共产党的领导之下，以无比的热情建设着自己的祖国，保卫着自己的祖国，这不仅表示出我国具有建设社会主义的雄厚力量，而且表示我国具有保卫亚洲和世界和平的雄厚力量。
    在国民党反动统治时代，我国人口出生率与世界各国比较并不低；但由于人民生活条件恶劣，社会秩序不安，因此死亡率高，人口的自然增加率比较低。在抗日战争以前，根据国内若干学术机关和国民党政府的典型调查材料，当时中国人口的自然增加率一般是在千分之十左右，解放以后几年来，由于生产的恢复和发展，人民生活的改善和医药卫生的进步，我国人口的死亡率急剧降低，因而人口的自然增加率有了显著提高。根据内务部统计的二十九个大中城市，宁夏全省以及其他省份的十个县的全县、三十五个县的一个区、二个镇、五十八个乡、七个村共三千零一十八万多人口的调查，我国人口目前的出生率平均为千分之三十七，死亡率平均为千分之十七，自然增加率平均为千分之二十。
    由于我国工业生产幼稚，城市人口所占比重较小。解放后由于工商业的迅速恢复和发展，城市人口已见显著增加。一九五三年全国各城市的常住人口（不包括流动人口、暂居人口）比一九五○年的全国各城市的人口总数共增加了百分之四十多。鞍山、抚顺、本溪、阜新、鹤岗、唐山、太原等许多工矿业城市比一九五○年的人口都增加一倍以上，有的增加到三倍多。在我国大规模的社会主义建设刚在开始的时候，已充分显示了城市人口增加的速度。
    根据直接调查登记的五亿七千四百二十万多人的年龄统计，解放后五年中，出生的不满一岁至四岁的婴幼儿占总人口的百分之十五点六，而且男女的比例已接近平衡。五至九岁的儿童则仅占总人口的百分之十一，且男多女少，情况很悬殊。这说明生活在毛泽东时代的男女儿童，都得到了正常的保育和幸福的生活，贫病愚昧和女婴常遭溺死虐待的时代已经过去了。
    劳动力是创造一切财富的。资产阶级经济学者死捧着早已破产了的马尔萨斯“人口论”，听到了我国有六亿多人口而大吃一惊，宣称中国将没有方法来养活这六亿多的人口，甚至制造中国必然要“向外侵略”的荒唐谣言。这种谬论显然是不值一驳的。我们承认在一个经济不发展的国家，人口迅速增长是有可能造成生活上的某些困难的。但我们国家有着广大的未开垦的土地和丰富的资源尚待开发，而最重要的是我们的社会制度的优越性保证了我们能够使国民经济不断发展，几年来我国工农业生产增长的速度显然远超过了人口增加的速度，因而人民生活的逐步改善是有充分保证的。到我们的社会主义建设完成时候，我国将像苏联一样完全消灭失业和半失业的现象，保证全体人民都能享受幸福生活。
    当我国正在大规模建设社会主义的今天，查清我们伟大祖国的人口数字，使我们清楚地掌握了建设社会主义的劳动资源和服务对象，使我们在城乡劳动力的统筹调度上，对城乡人民生产资料和生活资料的计划供应上，对粮食和食油等的统购统销上，对文教、卫生机构的设施上，对城市的规划建设上，以及其他为了人民和依靠人民的一系列的政治、经济、文化的措施上，都有了可靠的依据。因而这次人口调查，对我们建设社会主义是有巨大意义的。但是人口是随时变动的，而全国规模的人口调查又不能每年举行，因此各地应当在这次人口调查登记的基础上，建立起经常的户口登记制度，以随时掌握户口变动情况，继续为国家的各项建设提供准确的人口资料。
