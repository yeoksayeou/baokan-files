(Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 8th) According to TASS, Moscow, November 7th: As night fell on Moscow, the lights of the October Revolution blazed forth. Lights twinkled everywhere, illuminating the city as if it were daytime, and even making the sky glow faintly red. The clouds that had been hanging low over Moscow since early morning had also retreated far away.

Searchlight beams shot out in all directions, and all kinds of colorful electric light arches sparkled everywhere. Bright red flags fluttered in the autumn breeze under the lights. The slogans of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union for the October Revolution Day were particularly eye-catching on purple banners. The magnificent buildings looked like white statues in the light. The numbers "37," formed by lights on the buildings, caught people's eyes from afar.

The streets were packed with people. Muscovites of all ages came out to celebrate the capital's festival.

The Manege Square, not far from the Kremlin, was the center of the city. Here, the masses were reveling with great enthusiasm. On the open-air stage, the amateur art troupe of the Stalin Automobile Factory performed. The dancers performed the passionate Kazakh dance with great skill and artistry, winning rounds of applause from the audience. After them, the railway workers' choir performed. The songs beloved by the people resounded throughout the square. Then, professional actors from several major theaters in the capital gave brilliant performances.

Carnivals were held in many districts throughout the city. Music filled every square and street. Pairs of men and women sang and danced until late at night. The whole of Moscow was immersed in revelry.

At nine o'clock, fireworks were set off, and colorful fireworks soared into the sky.

Moscow fired a twenty-gun salute to celebrate the thirty-seventh anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution.

    莫斯科节日夜景
    【新华社八日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科七日讯：夜幕一降临莫斯科，十月节的灯火就齐放光明。遍地灯光闪闪，照耀得如同白昼，使天空都微微发红。从清早起就低低地笼罩莫斯科上空的云层，这时也远远地退去了。
    探照灯的光柱四射，用电灯织成的各式各样的彩环到处闪耀，红艳艳的旗帜在灯光下迎着晚秋的清风飞舞。苏联共产党中央委员会的十月革命节口号嵌在紫色的横幅上，分外醒目。巍峨的建筑物在灯光中宛如一尊尊的白色塑像。建筑物上用灯火组成了“37”两个大字，老远就映入人们眼帘。
    街道上人山人海。莫斯科男女老幼都出来消度首都的节日。
    练马场是全市的中心，离克里姆林宫不远。在这里，群众狂欢，意兴正浓。在露天舞台上，斯大林汽车工厂的业余艺术团作着表演。舞蹈家们极其熟练而富有技巧地表演了热情奔放的哈萨克舞，赢得了观众阵阵的掌声。在他们之后演出的是铁路员工的合唱团。人民喜爱的歌声洋溢在广场上。接着，首都几家大剧院的职业演员作了精采的表演。
    全市许多区都举行了游艺会。各个广场和街道上洋溢着音乐声。一对对的男女载歌载舞，直到深夜。整个莫斯科沉浸在狂欢中。
    九点钟，花炮齐放，彩色缤纷的焰火升上高空。
    莫斯科鸣礼炮二十响，庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命三十七周年。
