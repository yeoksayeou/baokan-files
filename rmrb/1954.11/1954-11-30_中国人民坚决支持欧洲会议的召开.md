The European Conference, proposed by the Soviet government, opened in Moscow on the 19th. Participating in this conference were government delegations from eight countries: the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Albania. The Chinese government also sent Zhang Wentian, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, as a representative to attend the meeting as an observer. This conference has also received support from many political figures and parties in other European countries, as well as the broad masses of people who desire peace. The widespread support this conference has received from the people of various European countries demonstrates that it fully accords with the aspirations of all countries and peoples seeking collective peace and security in Europe.

The convening of the European Conference is a timely and significant effort by the Soviet Union and peace-loving European countries to ensure collective peace and security in Europe. As everyone knows, the United States and its followers, in violation of existing international agreements on Germany, unilaterally signed agreements concerning West Germany in London and Paris this October, stipulating the restoration of West German militarism, the establishment of West German armed forces, and the inclusion of West Germany into the West European military aggressive bloc aimed at opposing other European countries. The implementation of these plans will inevitably lead to the deterioration of relations between European countries, accelerate the arms race in various countries, and subject the people of various European countries to the serious threat of a new war. In particular, the United States and its followers, fearing that this war plan would be opposed by the people of various countries and fail like the "European Army" treaty, are taking strong pressure to coerce the parliaments of relevant countries to ratify these war plans before the end of December this year. They want to use swift and sudden methods to revive West German militarism, divide Germany and Europe, make the peaceful reunification of Germany an impossible fait accompli, and threaten the security of peace-loving people in European countries. The Soviet Union and other peace-loving European countries have been compelled to take measures to safeguard their own security and convene the European Conference in Moscow, which is not only entirely justifiable but also very timely.

The governments of the United States, Britain, and France are trying to resist efforts to discuss the establishment of a European collective security system. They not only refuse to participate in the meeting themselves but also exert pressure on other European countries to prevent them from participating, in an attempt to obstruct the convening of the European Conference. Opponents of European collective security use the excuse of insufficient preparation time for the meeting, but everyone knows that the Soviet Union's proposals on establishing a pan-European collective security system and convening a European conference to discuss this issue were not raised for the first time recently. Moreover, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov pointed out in his answer to a reporter from the Soviet "Pravda" on November 20 that if the Western countries postponed the debate on the ratification of the Paris Agreement, it would be possible to reach an agreement on another date for convening the European Conference. However, the authorities of the United States, Britain, and France did not make a positive response to this, and continued to pressure Western European countries to ratify the Paris Agreement. However, people will not fail to see that once the Paris Agreement is implemented, West German militarism will be rapidly revived, and the division of Germany and Europe will be further deepened, which will not only create insurmountable obstacles to the restoration of German unification but also pose a serious threat to peace and security in Europe.

Obviously, the attempt of the American aggressive bloc and its British and French followers to force peace-loving European countries to accept the fait accompli of reviving German militarism and including West Germany in the Western military bloc is extremely unpopular. Not only do the broad masses of people in Western European countries strongly demand that their governments participate in the European Conference proposed by the Soviet Union and abandon the Paris and London agreements; but even some political leaders in Britain, France, and West Germany have expressed opposition to the so-called "ratify first, negotiate later" trick. The American rulers and their Western European followers refuse to participate in the European Conference and are determined to implement the criminal plan of reviving West German militarism, and they must bear full responsibility for aggravating the danger of a new war in Europe.

In the sinister plot of rearming West Germany and preparing for a new war, the American aggressive bloc and its partners do not conceal that their target is the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. However, historical experience has repeatedly shown that once German militarists are rearmed, they will unscrupulously carry out aggression against their neighbors, especially France. In the two world wars, especially in World War II, France and other European countries were occupied by the troops of German militarism, and the people suffered cruel enslavement and slaughter; the British Isles also suffered serious damage and threats. Now, the ruling groups of Britain and France are following the American ruling group in repeating the mistake of reviving German militarism, which will inevitably cause fatal damage to the interests of European countries, especially France. Moreover, because West Germany has once again fallen into the hands of German militarist forces, militarist forces will inevitably drive the German people to fight against other European countries again, which is also extremely unfavorable to the German people. At the same time, in the plan of the American aggressive bloc and its partners to revive German militarism, the reorganized German Wehrmacht will possess atomic weapons, and therefore the renewed aggression of German militarism will have the danger of causing a devastating atomic war in Europe. It is quite obvious that the people of various European countries, especially the people of France and Germany, who have been carrying out a resolute and heroic struggle against the revival of German militarism, will never tolerate this criminal practice of the American aggressive bloc and its British and French followers.

As for the American ruling group's desire to treat the Soviet Union with a so-called "policy of strength" and plan a war of aggression mainly targeting the Soviet Union, it will not have any good results. During World War II, the Soviet Union defeated the German fascist aggressive forces, powerfully proving that the Soviet Union is an invincible fortress of peace. Today, even the enemies of peace admit that the strength of the Soviet Union is even greater. The Soviet Union has the People's Republic of China and other People's Democratic countries standing with it at the forefront of defending peace, and it has also received the support of peace-loving and progressive people all over the world. The reason why the peace force headed by the Soviet Union is particularly strong lies in the fact that it is standing on the side of justice, and the cause of justice cannot be broken by any force.

The facts are becoming increasingly clear that while the American ruling group is further dividing Germany and Europe, rearming West Germany, organizing the West European military bloc, and preparing to launch a new war, it is also stepping

### 中国人民坚决支持欧洲会议的召开

     中国人民坚决支持欧洲会议的召开
    苏联政府建议召开的欧洲会议，一十九日在莫斯科开幕了。参加这个会议的有：苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国、保加利亚、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、阿尔巴尼亚等八个国家的政府代表团。我国政府也派遣我国外交部副部长张闻天为代表以观察员身份出席会议。这个会议还得到欧洲其他国家的许多政界人士和党派以及广大要求和平的人民的支持。这个会议得到欧洲各国人民这样广泛的支持，说明它是完全符合于一切谋求欧洲集体和平安全的国家和人民的愿望的。
    欧洲会议的召开，是苏联和欧洲爱好和平国家为保障欧洲集体和平安全所作的适时而重大的努力。大家知道，美国及其追随者们今年十月在德国问题上违反关于德国的现行国际协议，单独在伦敦和巴黎签订了有关西德的协定，规定恢复西德的军国主义，建立西德武装，并把西德拉入以反对欧洲其他国家为目的的西欧军事侵略集团。这些计划的实施，就必然会引起欧洲国家间关系的恶化，引起各国扩军运动的加速，使欧洲各国人民面临着新的战争的严重威胁。特别是美国及其追随者们生怕这个战争计划又像“欧洲军”条约一样遭到各国人民的反对而破产，正在采取强大压力，胁迫各有关国家议会在今年十二月底以前批准这些战争计划。他们想用迅雷不及掩耳的手法，把西德军国主义复活起来，分裂德国和欧洲，使德国的和平统一成为不可能的既成事实，威胁爱好和平的欧洲各国人民的安全。苏联和欧洲其他爱好和平国家迫不得已而采取保障他们自己安全的措施，在莫斯科召开欧洲会议，不仅完全是理所当然的，而且也是十分适时的。
    美、英、法三国政府力图抵制讨论建立欧洲集体安全体系的努力。它们不仅自己不参加会议，而且对其他欧洲国家施加压力，阻止它们参加，以图阻挠欧洲会议的召开。欧洲集体安全的反对者以准备会议时间不足作为拒绝欧洲会议的口实，但是谁都知道苏联关于建立全欧集体安全体系以及召开欧洲会议讨论这一问题的建议都并不是在最近才第一次提出来的，况且苏联莫洛托夫外长十一月二十日答复苏联“真理报”记者问题时已指出，如果西方国家批准巴黎协定的辩论延期的话，就召开欧洲会议的另外的日期达成协议是可能的。美、英、法三国政府当局却并没有对此作出积极的表示，而且继续压迫西欧国家批准巴黎协定。但是，人们不会不看到，巴黎协定一旦实施，西德军国主义便将迅速复活，德国和欧洲的分裂便将进一步加深，这不仅要对德国统一的恢复产生难以克服的障碍，而且给欧洲的和平与安全造成严重的威胁。
    显然，美国侵略集团及其英法追随者强使爱好和平的欧洲各国接受复活德国军国主义、把西德拉入西方军事集团的既成事实的图谋，是极不得人心的。不但西欧各国广大阶层的人民都强烈要求他们本国的政府参加苏联建议的欧洲会议，摈弃巴黎和伦敦协定；而且甚至英、法和西德等国的一些政治领袖也表示反对所谓“先批准后谈判”的骗局。美国统治者及其西欧的追随者拒绝参加欧洲会议，而一意实行复活西德军国主义的罪恶计划，他们必须担负使欧洲新战争危险加剧的全部责任。
    在重新武装西德、准备新战争的罪恶勾当中，美国侵略集团及其伙伴们并不掩饰他们的对象是苏联及人民民主国家。但是，历史的经验已经一再显示，德国军国主义者一旦重新武装起来，便会毫无顾忌地向它的邻国，首先是法国实行侵略。在上两次大战中，特别是第二次世界大战中，法国和其他欧洲国家都曾为德国军国主义的军队所侵占，人民遭受残酷的奴役和杀戮；英伦三岛也受到了严重的破坏和威胁。现在，英法两国的统治集团追随美国统治集团重蹈复活德国军国主义的覆辙，这就不可避免地要使欧洲国家，首先是法国的利益受到致命的损害。不仅如此，由于西德重新落入了德国军国主义势力的手中，军国主义势力必将驱使德国人民再次和欧洲其他国家作战，这对德国人民也是万分不利的。同时，在美国侵略集团及其伙伴们复活德国军国主义的计划中，重行组织起来的德国国防军将拥有原子武器，因而德国军国主义的重行侵略，将有在欧洲引起一场毁灭性的原子战争的危险。十分明显，为反对复活德国军国主义一直进行了坚决而英勇的斗争的欧洲各国人民，特别是法国人民和德国人民，是绝不会容忍美国侵略集团及其英、法追随者的这种罪恶做法的。
    至于美国统治集团想要以所谓“实力政策”对待苏联，并策划主要以苏联为对象的侵略战争，是不会有什么好结果的。在第二次世界大战期间，苏联打败了德国法西斯侵略势力，有力地证明了苏联是不可战胜的和平堡垒。今天，连和平的敌人也承认，苏联的力量是更加强大了。苏联有中华人民共和国和其他人民民主国家同它一起站在保卫和平的最前列，还得到了全世界爱好和平和进步的人民的支持。以苏联为首的和平力量所以特别强大的地方，更在于它是站在正义的一边，正义的事业是任何势力都攻不破的。
    事实越来越清楚地证明，美国统治集团在进一步分裂德国和欧洲、重新武装西德、组织西欧军事集团、准备发动新战争的同时，也在亚洲加紧复活日本军国主义，组织东南亚侵略集团和其他军事联盟，干涉和危害亚洲国家的主权和安全，支持蒋介石卖国集团，日益猖狂地对中华人民共和国进行挑衅。正是因为这样，中国人民和亚洲人民不仅关心亚洲的和平，要加紧努力扩大和巩固亚洲的和平地区，建立亚洲的集体和平和安全，而且关心欧洲的和平，同情和支持为欧洲集体安全而进行的斗争。只有当欧洲、亚洲和其他各洲的集体安全都得到了保障，世界才会有巩固的持久和平。
    目前欧洲爱好和平的国家和人民反对重新武装西德和建立西欧军事集团的斗争，在保卫世界和平运动中具有头等重要的意义。中国人民坚决支持欧洲会议的召开，并完全相信欧洲会议将能根据欧洲和世界人民的和平和安全的利益，作出重大的贡献。
