Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 20th: Late autumn grain crops in Hubei Province's non-disaster areas have largely yielded a bumper harvest. According to a rough estimate, the surplus grain production exceeds one billion jin.

Hubei Province's non-disaster areas are mainly mountainous and hilly regions. Farmers in these areas used to suffer from famine in previous years and received enthusiastic help from the state and the people in the areas along the Yangtze River and near the lakes. This autumn, farmers in non-disaster areas enthusiastically responded to the call of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and launched a campaign to increase production beyond quotas to support national construction and aid the people in disaster areas, fully demonstrating their enthusiasm for production. Farmers in Xiangyang Prefecture changed their past habits of not replanting or intercropping. This year, under the leadership of more than 180 agricultural production cooperatives and tens of thousands of mutual aid teams, they launched a production increase competition, braving rain and mud to complete the replanting and intercropping plan for more than 6.5 million mu of late autumn crops in a timely manner. Farmers in Tangni, Qili, Yanghe, and other townships in Enshi County rushed to plant from dawn till dusk, expanding the planting area to produce as much as possible. Farmers in non-disaster areas also universally carried out careful harvesting of mid-season rice and actively cultivated ratooning rice. The grain increase due to careful harvesting and threshing throughout the province is at least over 100 million jin. The cultivated ratooning rice amounts to nearly 6 million mu in the southwestern and northwestern mountainous areas alone.

After the late autumn crops were planted, the entire province experienced an autumn drought. Farmers then launched a tenacious struggle against the drought. Farmers in Macheng, Shengli, and other counties put forward the slogan of "Every inch of land must be fought for, every seedling must be protected," mobilizing 200,000 to 300,000 people day and night to dam rivers and draw water to irrigate the fields, saving most of the seedlings. In areas lacking water sources, farmers also dug wells and carried water to irrigate the seedlings, ensuring the harvest of dryland late autumn crops.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 20th: The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's outbound surplus grain is increasing year by year. The outbound original grain this year will reach two billion jin. Except for the Xilin Gol League, which is a purely pastoral area, the other six leagues and two administrative districts in the region have large amounts of surplus grain shipped out every year. Last year's outbound surplus grain increased by 44.4 percent compared to 1952; this year, due to the bumper harvest throughout the region, the amount of grain to be shipped out has increased by 20.22 percent compared to last year.

Recently, trainloads of grain have frequently been transported from railway stations in Hohhot, Baotou, Ulanhot, and other places. At various concentration points along the railway, there are daily arrivals of trucks, horse-drawn carts, and camel caravans loaded with grain from various agricultural areas. As of November 17th, 100 million jin of grain have been shipped out.

This year, farmers of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region received more than 55 billion yuan in agricultural loans from the state, adding new agricultural tools, draught animals, and improved seeds. At the same time, the broad masses of farmers waged a arduous struggle against natural disasters, launched an agricultural production increase campaign centered on mutual aid and cooperation, and overfulfilled the 1954 agricultural production increase plan by 600 million jin of grain. The surplus grain of farmers of all ethnic groups has increased after the bumper harvest. Farmers in the Hetao Administrative District harvested an average of more than 1,600 jin of grain per person this year, and the surplus grain sold to the state can reach more than 620 jin, an increase of 34.5 percent compared to last year. Over the past year, farmers of all ethnic groups have deeply realized the benefits of the state's policy of unified purchase and sale of grain and have enthusiastically sold more surplus grain to the state.

    湖北非灾区超额增产粮食十亿斤
    内蒙古自治区今年外运原粮将达二十亿斤
    【新华社武汉二十日电】湖北省非灾区晚秋粮食作物大部丰收。据粗略计算，超额增产的粮食达十亿斤左右。
    湖北省非灾区主要是山区和丘陵区。这些地区的农民往年也曾遭过灾荒，得过国家和沿江滨湖地区人民的热情帮助。今年秋天，非灾区农民热烈响应中共湖北省委员会的号召，开展了支援国家建设、支援灾区人民的超额增产运动，充分发挥了生产积极性。襄阳专区农民改变往年没有补种、间作的习惯，今年在一百八十多个农业生产合作社和上万个互助组带动下开展增产竞赛，冒着阴雨、泥泞，及时完成了六百五十多万亩晚秋作物的补种、间作计划。恩施县塘泥、七里、杨和等乡农民为了尽可能多增产，披星戴月进行抢种，扩大播种面积。非灾区农民还普遍对中稻精收细打，积极培育再生稻。全省因精收细打而增产的粮食，最低在一亿斤以上。培育的再生稻，仅西南部和西北部山区就有近六百万亩。
    当晚秋作物种植下去后，全省发生了秋旱。农民又向干旱展开了顽强的斗争。麻城、胜利等县农民提出“寸土必争，棵苗必保”的口号，先后出动二三十万人，日夜拦河筑坝，车水灌田，救活了大部禾苗。缺少水源的地区，农民也纷纷挖井挑水浇苗，保住了旱地晚秋作物的收成。
    【新华社呼和浩特二十日电】内蒙古自治区外运余粮，一年比一年增加。今年外运的原粮将达二十亿斤。全区除了纯牧业区的锡林郭勒盟外，其他六个盟和两个行政区每年都有大批余粮外运。去年外运的余粮比一九五二年增加了百分之四十四点四；今年由于全区获得丰收，决定外运的粮食又比去年增加了百分之二十点二二。
    近日来，经常有一车皮一车皮的粮食从呼和浩特、包头、乌兰浩特等地的火车站上向外运输。铁路沿线的各集中点上，每天都有从各农业区到来的满载粮食的汽车、马车和驼运队。到十一月十七日止，已运出粮食一亿斤。
    今年自治区各族农民得到国家五百五十多亿元的农业贷款，增添了新式农具、耕畜和优良种籽等。同时，广大农民和自然灾害作了艰苦的斗争，开展了以互助合作为中心的农业增产运动，全区超额六亿斤粮食完成了一九五四年的农业增产计划。获得丰收后的各族农民的余粮增加了。河套行政区农民今年每人平均收获一千六百多斤粮食，卖给国家的余粮可达六百二十多斤，比去年增加百分之三十四点五。一年来各族农民深切体会到国家实行粮食统购统销政策的好处，踊跃把更多的余粮卖给了国家。
