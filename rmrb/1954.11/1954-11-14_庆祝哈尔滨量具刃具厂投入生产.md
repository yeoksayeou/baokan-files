    Celebrating the Commissioning of the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant

    China's first modern precision machine tool manufacturing plant, the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant, has been completed and has fully entered the production phase. The Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant is one of the key projects built during China's First Five-Year Plan. Under the leadership of the Party and the government, with the comprehensive assistance of the Soviet Union, and the enthusiastic support of people from all over the country, the entire staff who participated in the construction worked hard for one year and six months to build it. The completion of such a technologically complex factory in such a short period of time once again proves a truth: building modern industry on a weak industrial base, no matter how difficult, can be overcome under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, relying on the efforts of the people of the whole country, and relying on the brotherly assistance of the Soviet Union. The Chinese people will draw strength from this, and increase their confidence in achieving socialist industrialization.

    The completion of the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant will promote the further development of China's machinery industry. We know that measuring tools are used to determine the accuracy of products, and cutting tools are used to cut metal and drill holes in metal. They are both indispensable tools for the machinery industry. The higher the precision of the products manufactured by the machinery industry, the more complete and precise measuring and cutting tools are needed. Otherwise, the quality of products will not be guaranteed. Over the past five years, China's machinery industry has moved from the repair stage before liberation to the stage of beginning to manufacture products with relatively high precision. However, in the past, China did not have factories that manufactured precision measuring and cutting tools. The precision measuring and cutting tools used by machinery manufacturing factories were all imported from abroad. However, due to the small number of imports, many factories lacked sufficient precision measuring and cutting tools, and the precision of many products did not meet the required standards. In the future, with the development of the national industrialization and national defense modernization, the machinery industry will need to manufacture more and more precise metallurgical equipment, power generation equipment, machine tools, as well as modern transportation equipment and agricultural machinery, etc., and the precision measuring and cutting tools required will inevitably increase. The Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant was built to meet this need. Therefore, its commissioning will promote the further improvement of manufacturing technology in China's machinery industry, and will play a certain role in the development of China's industrialization.

    Of course, it is not enough to just build the factory; it is also necessary to put the equipment into operation to give full play to the factory's due role. As Comrade Stalin once pointed out: "In order to make technology work and utilize it to the end, we need technically proficient personnel, and we need cadres who are good at learning to utilize and skillfully apply this technology." The existing engineering and technical personnel in the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant are not only of low quality, but also only one-ninth of the prescribed number. The average technical grade of workers should be 4.5, but in reality, technical workers below grade 3 account for more than 75%, and some workshops account for more than 88%. There are many new machines that workers do not yet know how to operate or maintain. Therefore, striving to improve technical skills has become the most urgent and serious task for all employees of the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant.

    This contradiction between technical strength lagging behind needs will also appear in other factories equipped with advanced Soviet technology, and the situation in some factories may be even more serious. Therefore, we must attach importance to and do a good job in cultivating technical reserve forces. Basic construction units should pay attention to cultivating production technical forces from the beginning, just as they attach importance to design and construction. Every production enterprise should regard cultivating new workers for new enterprises as the most glorious task. Relevant Party organizations at all levels should also regularly care about and supervise enterprises to implement worker training plans.

    The facts of the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant tell us that it is not only difficult for new workers to master new technologies, but it is also not easy for old technical workers to master new technologies, because they have to be familiar with the principles of new technologies and fight against old and bad habits. However, the facts of the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant also tell us: Chinese workers are very happy to use new machines and are very enthusiastic about learning new technologies; at the same time, Soviet experts provide full guidance. These are favorable conditions for China to cultivate new technical forces. As long as we make good use of these conditions and strengthen the work of cultivating technical forces, we can become familiar with and master new technologies relatively quickly, and quickly use new equipment to create miracles!

### 庆祝哈尔滨量具刃具厂投入生产

    庆祝哈尔滨量具刃具厂投入生产
    我国新建的第一座现代化的精密机械工具制造工厂——哈尔滨量具刃具厂已经建成，并全部进入掌握生产的阶段。哈尔滨量具刃具厂是我国在第一个五年计划期间建设的重点工厂之一。它是在党和政府的领导下，在苏联全面的援助下，在各地人民热诚的支援下，由参加建设的全体职工作了一年零六个月的艰苦奋斗建设成的。在这样短的时间内，建成这样一个技术复杂的工厂，这又一次证明了一个真理：在薄弱的工业基础上建设现代的工业，纵然困难重重，但是，在中国共产党正确的领导下，依靠全国人民的努力，依靠苏联兄弟般的援助，任何困难都是可以克服的。我国人民将从这里吸取前进的力量，提高实现社会主义工业化的信心。
    哈尔滨量具刃具厂的建成，将促进我国机械工业进一步的发展。我们知道，量具是用来测定产品的准确程度，刃具是用来切削金属和在金属上钻孔的，它们都是机械工业所不可缺少的工具。机械工业制造的产品的精密度越高，越需要有完整的精密的量具和刃具。不然，产品质量便没有保证。五年来，我国机械工业已经从解放前的修理性的阶段，进入开始制造精密度比较高的产品的阶段。但是，我国过去没有制造精密的量具和刃具的工厂，机械制造工厂所使用的精密量具和刃具，都是从国外进口的。但因进口的数量不多，以致不少的工厂里都缺乏足够的精密量具和刃具，许多产品的精密度不合标准的要求。今后，随着国家工业化和国防现代化事业的发展，需要机械工业制造更多、更精密的冶金设备、发电设备、工作母机，以及现代的交通运输设备和农业机械等等，其所需要的精密的量具和刃具，必将日益增加。哈尔滨量具刃具厂正是为着满足这个需要而建设的。因此，它的投入生产，必将推动我国机械工业的制造技术的进一步提高，对于我国工业化事业的发展将起一定的作用。
    当然仅仅把工厂建设起来还是不够的，还必须把设备开动起来，才能发挥工厂应有的作用。正像斯大林同志曾经指出的：“为要使技术动作起来并把它利用到底，就需要有精通技术的人才，就需要有善于学会利用和巧于运用这种技术的干部。”哈尔滨量具刃具厂现有的工程技术人员不只是质量较低，并且数量也只有规定的九分之一。工人的平均技术等级应为四点五级，实际上这里三级以下的技术工人占百分之七十五以上，一些车间占百分之八十八以上。有许多新机器，工人还不会开动、不会维护。因此，努力提高技术水平就成为哈尔滨量具刃具厂全体职工当前最迫切和最严重的任务了。
    这种技术力量落后于需要的矛盾，在其他以苏联的先进技术装备起来的工厂里也会出现，其中有的工厂的情况也许更为严重。因此，我们必须重视和做好培养技术后备力量的工作。基本建设单位应当跟重视设计和施工一样，从开始就注意培养生产的技术力量。每一个生产的企业，应该把为新企业培养新工人当作最光荣的任务。有关的各级党组织也应该经常关心和督促企业实现培养工人的计划。
    哈尔滨量具刃具厂的事实告诉我们，不仅是新工人掌握新技术很困难，就是老技术工人掌握新技术也并不容易，因为他们要熟悉新技术的原理，要跟旧的不良的习惯作斗争。但是，哈尔滨量具刃具厂的事实也告诉我们：我国工人非常乐于使用新机器，非常热衷于学习新技术；同时，又有苏联专家给以充分的指导。这是我国培养新的技术力量的有利条件。只要我们很好地利用这些条件，加强培养技术力量的工作，我们就可以比较快地熟悉并掌握新技术，迅速地运用新的设备创造出奇迹来！
