The Happiness of Geological Prospectors
——A Visit to the No. 241 Exploration Team of the Central Geological Department
By our reporter Liu Heng
Before visiting Team 241, someone told me: "Geological prospectors are people who open up the world. They move into the barren mountains, set up tents, and build a life on bare stones. When new factories are to be built, they move to another front. They constantly struggle arduously, leaving happiness to the future, to those who come later."
After visiting Team 241, I felt that this statement was only half right. The other half is: geological prospectors are also very happy people now.
“This is the Baoshan Fudi Great Iron Mine”
People say: geological prospectors are "treasure hunters," the "vanguard and pioneers of industrial construction." The exploration team members of Team 241 like to compare themselves to "eyes." Feng Yongyi of the geophysical prospecting team said, "We are the eyes of geological work, able to see through all strata." Shao Weiyuan of the laboratory said, "We are the eyes of geological work, able to see the iron and sulfur content of ores." He Shuyan, a college student from Beijing Geological Institute who was doing an internship, stood on the top of a high mountain, looking around, and couldn't help but want to write a poem:
	“We are the eyes of industrial construction,
	Able to see into the heart of the earth.
	We have seen the secrets of the earth,
	Ha, becoming the true masters of the earth!”
People come to the mountains and see the boundless grasslands and the high, distant sky. They see that the hills are dotted with large and small stones, and sheep that look like stones.
When exploration team members come to the mountains, they not only see what others see, but also what others cannot see.
Comrades from the general survey team carry iron hammers and compasses, singing: "Mountains and ridges, how can you stop us? Rivers and streams, we must cross them!" After wandering all over the mountains, they see: mountains are not just mountains, stones are not just stones. On the mountains, on the stones, they see granite and limestone. By knocking everywhere with their hammers, they see: "Iron!"
Comrades from the drilling team erect pointed drill towers, shouting the slogan "Drill to the center of the earth" while poking several extremely deep holes in the mine. They carefully listen to the breathing and heartbeat of Mother Earth while holding onto the feed handle. Then, they take out the core, analyze it, and calculate it, and they see: the position, size, and appearance of the iron ore fetus.
People run to the mountains and take a look, saying, "This is barren land with chaotic stones." Geological prospectors run to the mountains and take a look, saying, "No! This is the Baoshan Fudi Great Iron Mine." What appears before their eyes is a rich and wonderful scientific world—this is the geological prospector’s
“professional secret.” Chen Xin, a geological engineer from Team 241, told me, "Many people outside say: 'You deal with stones and sand all day long, it's too monotonous and boring.' 'You run around in barren mountains and wilderness all year round, it's so hard!' Actually, the field is my home, the place where I can use my skills."

There’s a Sweet Taste After the Hardship
However, fieldwork is, after all, difficult.
Wang Licheng of the repair shop told me:
"I really don't know where so many big, strange winds come from, roaring all day long, like thunder. The electric wires are also screaming and yelling all day long, and the stones and sand hit the wooden houses with a bang, which is deafening. Dust blows everywhere, you can't even see the sun, you can't even see people clearly.
"One day, Ma Shiji, that skinny apprentice from our repair shop, carried two pots of boiling water, walking in the wind. The wind, ah, was strong in bursts, tight in bursts. Suddenly, his hat was blown off, his water pot was blown away, and he himself—ha, was blown around on the ground for two circles."
Zhao Fuqing from the motorcade also told me:
"It snows here in September and October. Once it snows, hey, see you next year! It won't melt this year.
	"Once it starts snowing, don't expect it to stop. It snows on snowy days, and it snows on non-snowy days—guess why? It's that wind, ah, the wind blows the snow from the high places, scattering it all over the sky. This wind is our famous White-haired Whirlwind. But, then again, there should be White-haired Whirlwinds in grasslands and pastoral areas. Otherwise, if the snow covers the grass tightly, where will the sheep find food?"
I thought, "Talking about such bad weather is quite interesting, but it would be too hard to work in it." At a youth forum, I just said my thoughts, and with a "buzz," it aroused heated opposition from the exploration team members:
	"This is 'division of labor'! Some people are assigned to the iron-smelting furnace, how hot! Some people are assigned to fish in the icy lake, how cold! The task assigned to geological prospectors is to find treasures, and we have to go to any difficult place."
"Every job has its own 'hardships,' the question is whether you can endure 'hardship.' After the hardship, sweetness comes."
At the meeting, Xin Kuide, the captain of the hydrogeology team, told us his own experience:
"A few days ago, we were doing a flow velocity test. We put fluorescent red (a kind of color) into the river. Every hour, we had to scoop back a bottle of water from the observation well and measure the color depth with a colorimeter to make a graph. Then, according to the graph, we can calculate the speed and size of the river.
	"The river flows day and night, and the test work must be carried out in the middle of the night.
	"We live four or five miles away from the observation well, and we have to walk there and back. It's nothing during the day. But at night—hey, go there? The sky is dark, and the wind is hard, stinging your face really hurts! Maybe you'll run into a wolf and it will eat you. Good! If you're so timid, you're in trouble! If you miss the time, the test won't be accurate!
At that time, I thought: Can you not go? Factories are to be built here, iron mines are to be opened, can it work without water? It won't work! Machines need water, and people need to drink water.
	"Is it okay if you just find the water? It won't work either! You also need to find out how much water there is. If you don't know how much water there is, how can the factory be designed? If the design is too big, the water supply will not be enough, and the state's property will be wasted; if the design is too small, the iron mining speed will be small, and industrialization will be delayed—you see, how great is our responsibility!
	"As soon as I thought of my responsibility, all the wolves, foxes, and ghosts were gone, and I took a bottle and went out.
	"The big north wind blew head-on, stopping me from moving, so I closed my breath and charged at it. The big north wind blew head-on, choking me, so I turned my back and walked backwards. If I saw something black in front of me, I opened my throat and sang loudly. Charging all the way, singing all the way, one foot high, one foot low, and soon, I arrived at the observation well. Looking at it, the time was just right! I filled the bottle with water, holding my treasure, and charged all the way, sang all the way, one foot high, one foot low, I went home.
	"Once I got home—oh, my face was purple, my hands were numb, my feet were wet, my clothes were covered in mud, and my whole body was as uncomfortable as if it had been pricked by needles. But, at this time—right at this time, suddenly a sweet taste welled up in my heart, because I had completed the task assigned to me by the people….”
This is the sweet taste that comes after hardship. It is the sweet taste that only those who are loyal to the people's cause can have. I know that this sweet taste is called: "Happiness."
Where is Happiness?
Regarding the issue of hardship and sweetness in geological exploration work, the youths of Team 241 have many more experiences.
Shao Shixiong of the hydrogeology team said, "I don't see any hardship in geological exploration work, only endless joy! Just take the natural conditions, the wind doesn't blow every day, and it doesn't snow every day. Can you enjoy such beautiful grassland scenery in the big city?
	"Sometimes I work the night shift, guarding the night until dawn. I saw the sky gradually brightening, and a winding black line appearing far away, outlining the contours of the mountains. After a while, all the stars disappeared, and the sun rose, so red, so bright, not at all dazzling. I saw it rise with my own eyes, jumping twice, like a mischievous big rubber ball. Suddenly, thousands of rays of sunlight burned half the sky red, and the entire grassland was covered with gold. At this time, the thrush was singing, the lark was singing, the golden-yellow cattle herd was drinking water with their heads down, and the snow-white sheep herd seemed to be frightened, running one by one. The grassland was immediately lively, full of light, sound, and color. My whole body was full of strength, I wanted to sing, to dance, to shout, even my heart wanted to rush out!
	"I really hope that our painters, poets, and musicians can come here…."
"I find great pleasure in my work." Hu Weixing of the geology team said, "We study only the things underground. What kind of rock is in what place, what kind of mine is in what place, we have to calculate in advance, draw an 'ideal columnar section,' and hang it in the drill room. We say that there is an iron mine one hundred meters underground. Sure enough, the drilling workers drilled about one hundred meters and took out an iron-containing core. Then you should see us laughing and shouting, as if this iron mine was not originally there, but was created by us personally."
"I am most happy to be trained as a machine operator, so that I can do more for the country." Yang Jinxiang of the drilling team said, "I used to drive a tricycle, and I had never even seen whether the drilling machine was round or flat. When I came to the drilling room, the master worker Zhang Jianxun taught me hand in hand, explaining to me bit by bit:
	'To raise and lower the drilling tools, you must be quick with your hands, eyes, and feet. Look at the top, hold the lifting handle, and step on the automatic brake, all at the same time!' 'Holding the feed handle is like a doctor taking a pulse, listening and feeling with your hands. The first time I operated the feed handle, I saw a two-foot-long core jumping out of the drill pipe, and I didn't let that comrade from the geology section smash it. That comrade from the geology section smiled and didn't smash it, but took it away. Later—of course it was smashed, not only smashed, but also ground into powder. Tell me, how can you do a chemical analysis without grinding it into powder? But at the time, I wouldn't let him smash my core in front of me!"
Regarding the issue of hardship and sweetness in geological exploration work, the old geological workers of Team 241 also have deep feelings.
"If you want to talk about hardship, it refers to our past." Li Yuying, an old geological worker of more than ten years, said heavily, "When Nanjing was liberated, I was in the puppet Central Geological Survey. The military representative asked us 'What are your demands?' We said, 'We hope there is a pension regulation.' You see how tragic this is!
	"In that society, our lives were not guaranteed! When we went to the field, we often couldn't eat lunch, often starving or eating our fill, causing many people to get stomach problems.
	"It's not so bad to get stomach problems, but if you run into bandits or wild animals in the mountains, then you're done for! Not only are you done for, but your wife and children will also be done for, and they won't even receive a penny of pension!
	"In 1944, Mr. Xu Deyou, Mr. Chen Kang, and Mr. Ma Yisi were exploring in Guizhou when they were captured and killed by bandits. At that time, geologists were so heartbroken that they held a memorial service in Beibei, Sichuan, crying for them and crying for ourselves. At the meeting, a high-ranking official of the Kuomintang reactionary government said, 'Geological work requires not being afraid of death, those who are afraid of death should not do geological work!' You see, this is our past!"
"Now, it's no longer a question of receiving a pension!" Yan Kunyuan, the deputy captain of Team 241, said meaningfully, "I was among the first group of people to come here in May 1950, and I know this change. At that time, there were both bandits and wolves here. There were only about twenty of us, but there was a cavalry company and an infantry platoon sent to protect us!
	"I saw with my own eyes that the bandits here were wiped out and the wolves were driven away. I saw with my own eyes that the number of people here increased day by day, and the houses were built day by day. Now, there are electric lights, telephones, and radios here, and there are banks, trading companies, Xinhua bookstores, barbershops, bathhouses, everything, isn't it like a small city? There is a movie here every ten or eight days, and there are comfort groups coming to perform during the New Year and festivals…."
"Not only in terms of life, but also in terms of work, we feel a deep sense of happiness." Li Yuying continued, "In the past, I didn't know what the use of geological exploration work was, what problems it was to solve. After liberation, I learned that geological exploration is for mining, for the country's socialist industrialization, what a glorious task! In the past, I was always worried about not being able to make ends meet; now, I'm always worried about time passing too quickly! Tell me, when you feel that your intelligence and talents can be brought into full play to serve the people, and the people need you so much, aren't you the happiest person?"

    地质勘探者的幸福
    ——中央地质部二四一勘探队访问记
    本报记者　刘衡
    访问二四一队以前，有人告诉我：“地质勘探者是些开天辟地的人。他们开进荒山，支起帐篷，在精光的石头上建立生活。等到新的工厂要盖了，他们又转移到另外一个阵地。他们不断地艰苦奋斗，把幸福留给将来、留给后来的人。”
    在访问二四一队以后，我感到这话只说对了一半。另外一半是：地质勘探者在现在也是十分幸福的人。
    “这是宝山富地大铁矿”
    人们说：地质勘探者是“找宝的人”，是“工业建设的前哨、尖兵”。二四一队的勘探队员爱把自己比作“眼睛”。物理探矿队的冯永义说：“我们是地质工作的眼睛，能看穿一切地层。”化验室的邵炜源说：“我们是地质工作的眼睛，能看到矿石含铁、含硫的成分。”北京地质学院来实习的大学生贺书严站在高高的山顶，放眼四望，就忍不住要做诗：
      “我们是工业建设的眼睛，
    能够看到地球的内心。
    我们看见了地球的秘密，
    嗬，做了真正的地球主人！”
    人们到山上来，看见了无边无际的草原，又高又远的天。看见了一个接连一个的山包包上，斑斑点点地嵌满了大大小小的石头，和像石头一样的羊群。
    勘探队员到山上来，不光看见了别人所看见的，还看见了别人看不见的。
    普查队的同志腰挎铁锤，手把罗盘，嘴里唱着：“山啦，岭啦，哪能挡得住？江啊，河啊，咱要跨过去！”满山遍野转一转，他们就看见了：山不光是山，石头不光是石头。在山上面，在石头上面，他们看见了花岗岩、石灰岩。把锤子到处敲一敲，就看见了：“铁”！
    钻探队的同志竖起尖尖的钻塔，一边喊着“打到地球中心去”的口号，一边把矿山戳上几个极深的窟窿。他们手扶给进把，仔细地倾听着大地母亲的呼吸、心跳。然后，取出岩芯，化验一下，计算一下，就看见了：铁矿胎儿的胎位、大小、长了一付什么样子。
    人们跑到山上看了一看，说：“这是荒山野地乱石头。”地质勘探者跑到山上看了一看，说：“不！这是宝山富地大铁矿。”出现在他们眼睛面前的，是一个富饶的奇妙的科学世界——这就是地质勘探者
  “职业的秘密”。二四一队地质工程师陈鑫告诉我：“外边很多人说：‘你们整天跟石头、砂子打交道，太单调、太枯躁了。’‘你们成年累月在荒山野岭奔跑，好苦哟！’其实，野外才是我的家，是我用武的地方。”
    苦过去就有一股甜味儿
    可是，野外工作毕竟是艰苦的。
    修配间的王立成对我说：
    “真不晓得从哪儿来的那样多那样大的怪风，整天呼噜呼噜，跟打雷一样。电线也是整天呜里哇啦乱叫，石头、砂子打得木板房子乒哩乓啷直响，把人的耳朵都要吵聋了。灰尘刮得哪里都是，连太阳也看不见了，人都看不清了。
    “那天，马士骥，我们修配间那个瘦瘦小小的学工，提了两壶开水，在风地里走。那风啊，一阵一阵的大，一阵一阵的紧。突然，他的帽子吹掉了，水壶吹跑了，他自己——哈，吹得在地上转了两个圈。”
    汽车队的赵福庆也告诉我：
    “这里九、十月间就会下雪。一下雪，嗨，就明年见！今年怎么也化不了。
      “天下开了雪，你就不要指望它会停上一停。下雪的日子它要下雪，不下雪的日子它也要下雪——你猜怎么的？就是那风呀，风把高地方的雪刮走了，扬得满天都是。这风，就是我们这儿有名的白毛旋风。不过，话又得说回来，在草原、牧区，就应该有白毛旋风。要不，雪把草儿盖严了，羊到哪儿找饭吃？”
    我想：“这样坏的天气，在嘴边说说倒挺有趣。要是在这里边做工作，就太苦了。”在一次青年人的座谈会上，我刚把我的想法说出嘴，“嗡”的一声，惹起了勘探队员们热烈的反对：
      “这是‘分工’嘛！有的人分到高炉旁边炼铁，多么热！有的人分到冰湖里打渔，又多么冷！地质勘探者分的工是找宝，什么苦地方都得去。”
    “哪样工作都有哪样工作的‘苦处’，问题是看你能不能吃‘苦’。苦过去，甜就来了。”
    会上，水文地质队的队长辛奎德向我们讲了他自己的体会：
    “前些天做流水速度试验。我们把萤光红（一种颜色）丢进河里。每隔一个钟头就要到观测孔舀回一瓶水，用比色计测一测水的颜色深浅，把它制成图线。然后根据图线，我们就可以计算出河水的速度、大小。
    “河水是日夜不停地流，试验工作半夜三更也要进行。
    “我们住的地方离观测孔有四、五里路远，要走着去，走着回。白天倒没什么。一到夜里——嘿，你去吧？天又黑，风又硬，锥在脸上真是疼！说不定碰上一只狼，会把你吃了。好！你这么一胆小，就糟了糕！时间一错过，试验就不准了！
    当时我想的是：你不去行吗？这里要盖工厂，要开铁矿，没有水行吗？不行的！机器要用水，人也要喝水。
    “你光把水找到了，行吗？也不行的！你还要找出水有好大。你不晓得水有好大，工厂怎么设计？设计大了，水供应不上，就要浪费国家财产；设计小了，铁的开采速度就小了，工业化就要推迟——你们看，我们的责任多大！
    “我一想起责任，什么狼狐鬼怪都没有了，拿了个瓶子就出了门。
    “大北风迎头刮过来，顶得我走不动，我就闭着气对着它冲。大北风迎头刮过来，噎得我出不来气，我就背过身子退着走。要是看见前面有一个什么黑东西，我就张开喉咙大声地唱。一路冲，一路唱，一脚高，一脚低，一会儿，我就到了观测孔。一看，时间正好！我把瓶子灌满水，捧着我的宝贝，又是一路冲，一路唱，一脚高，一脚低，我回了家。
    “一回到家——哎呀，我的脸也紫了，手也麻了，脚也湿了，衣服上尽是泥巴，浑身难过得像针扎了一样。可是，这时候——正在这时候，忽然我心头涌出了一股甜味儿，因为我已经完成了人民交给我的任务……。”
    这是苦过去就有的甜味儿。是只有忠于人民事业的人才有的甜味儿。我知道，这甜味儿就叫：“幸福。”
    幸福在哪里？
    对于地质勘探工作的苦、甜问题，二四一队的青年们还有很多体会。
    水文地质队邵时雄说：“我看，搞地质勘探就没有什么苦，只有无穷的乐处！光拿自然条件说吧，风又不是天天刮，雪也不是天天下。那样好看的草原风光，在大城市里能享受得到吗？
    “有时我做夜班，守夜守到天明。我看见天空一点一点发亮，远远现出一道弯弯曲曲的黑线，画出了山的轮廓。一会儿，满天星星都看不见了，太阳升起，那样红，那样鲜艳，一点不刺眼睛。我亲眼看见它升上来，跳了两跳，像一个顽皮的大皮球一样。突然，万道霞光，烧红了半边天，整个草原铺满了金子。这时，画眉鸟在唱，百灵鸟在唱，金黄金黄的牛群在低头喝水，雪白雪白的羊群像是受了什么惊吓一样，一个挨一个地奔跑。草原立刻热闹起来了，到处都是光，都是声音，都是颜色。我浑身都是力量，我要唱，要跳，要大喊，连心都要冲出来了！
    “我很希望我们的画家、诗人、音乐家们，能够到这里来……。”
    “我在工作中找到极大的愉快。”地质队胡维兴说：“我们研究的尽是些地底下的事。什么地方有什么岩，什么地方有什么矿，我们都要预先计算出来，画出‘理想柱状图’，挂在钻机房里。我们说，一百公尺的地底下是铁矿。果然，钻探工人钻了一百公尺左右，就拿出含铁的岩芯。那时你看我们笑啊，叫啊，就像这个铁矿不是原来就有的，而是我们几个人亲手把它创造出来的一样。”
    “我最高兴的是把我训练成一个机长，能给国家多做点事。”钻探队杨进祥说：“我原先是拉三轮的，连钻机是圆的是扁的都没见过。来到钻机房，老师傅张建勋手把手地教我，一滴一点地给我讲：
  ‘升降钻具要手快眼快脚快。眼看上面，手扶升降手把，脚踏自动闸，一齐动作！’‘扶给进把就跟医生号脉、听诊一样，耳朵要听，手要摸，要感觉。’头一回我操纵给进把，看见两尺长的岩芯从钻杆里跳出来了，我就不让地质科那位同志把它打碎。地质科那位同志笑了笑，没有打碎，把它拿走了。以后——当然是打碎啦，不光是打碎了，还把它磨成了粉。你说，不磨成粉，怎么能进行化验？可是，当时我就不让他在我跟前把我的岩芯打碎！”
    对于地质勘探工作的苦、甜问题，二四一队的老地质工作者们的体会也是很深的。
    “如果要说苦，那是指我们的过去。”十多年的老地质工作者李毓英沉重地说：“南京解放的时候，我在伪中央地质调查所。军事代表问我们“有什么要求。我们说：‘希望有个抚恤条例’。你听，这有多惨！
    “在那个社会，我们的生命是没有保障的呀！我们到野外去，中午吃不上饭，常常是饥一顿、饱一顿，闹得很多人得了胃病。
    “得了胃病倒不怕，要是在山上碰见土匪，或者是什么豺狼虎豹，那你就完了！不光是你自己完了，你的老婆、孩子一家人都要跟着完了，他们连一个钱的抚恤金也领不到！
    “一九四四年，许德佑、陈康、马以思三位先生在贵州勘探，他们被土匪捉去杀了。当时地质界同人好不心伤，就在四川北碚开了个追悼会，一边哭他们，一边也哭我们自己。会上，国民党反动政府的一个高级官员说：‘干地质就要不怕死，怕死的不要干地质！’你听，这就是我们那个过去！”
    “现在，早已不是领抚恤金的问题了！”二四一队副队长严坤元意味深长地说：“我是一九五○年五月最先一批到这里来的，我知道这个变化。那个时候，这里又有土匪又有狼。我们一共才二十几个人，可是，派来保护我们的，就有一个骑兵连、一个步兵排！
      “我亲眼看见这里的土匪被肃清了，狼被赶跑了。我亲眼看见这里的人一天一天增多，房子一天一天盖起来。现在，这里电灯、电话、收音机都有了，银行、贸易公司、新华书店、理发馆、澡堂子，样样俱全，还不像个小城市？这里十天、八天就有一次电影，过年过节还有慰问团来演戏……。”
      “不光是在生活方面，在工作方面我们也感到深深的幸福。”李毓英接着又说：“以前我就不知道搞地质勘探工作有什么用处，要解决什么问题。解放以后，我才知道搞地质勘探是为了开采，为了国家社会主义工业化，任务真光荣！以前，我老愁日子过不去；现在，老愁日子过得快！你说，当你感到你的聪明才智都能发挥出来，为人民服务，而人民又是那样的需要你，你还不是一个最幸福的人吗？”
