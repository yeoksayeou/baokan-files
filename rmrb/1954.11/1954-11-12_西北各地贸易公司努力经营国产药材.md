    Northwest Region Trading Companies Strive to Manage Domestic Medicinal Materials
    Trading companies in various parts of the Northwest region have vigorously carried out medicinal material management work and have achieved considerable results. The total value of medicinal materials purchased from January to September this year is close to the total value of purchases for the entire year of 1953, an increase of twelve times compared to 1950. Among them, rhubarb, licorice root, and angelica, were acquired a total of 6.85 million jin in nine months, an increase of 7.53% compared to the entire year of 1953.
    Trading companies in the Northwest region have adopted many effective measures to strengthen medicinal material management work. Wholesale medicinal material departments and other specialized medicinal material management organizations have been established in major cities such as Xi'an and Lanzhou. The number of medicinal material varieties managed in various places this year is generally half or more than doubled compared to last year. The Xixiang County Trading Company in Shaanxi Province has added 54 types of medicinal materials this year that it had never managed before, such as blister beetles and ginseng leaves. The number of medicinal material varieties managed by the Feng County Trading Company has increased from 40 to 132. In August this year, the Qinghai Province Trading Company purchased angelica, poria cocos, and ophiopogon japonicus worth over 1.4 billion yuan from Xi'an and Lanzhou, curbing the phenomenon of private merchants selling medicinal materials at high prices, so that medicinal materials can be supplied in large quantities at reasonable prices. In the past, local people had to spend 4,000 yuan to buy a dose of ordinary Chinese medicine, but now they only need 2,000 yuan. In the third quarter of this year, the Xi'an City Trading Company sent people to Xinjiang, Gansu and other places to purchase a large number of medicinal materials. In addition to actively supplying domestic needs, it also used some of the rhubarb, angelica and other medicinal materials for export.
    This year, Northwest trading companies organized the export of more than 20 kinds of medicinal materials, including poria cocos, rhubarb, licorice root, angelica, wolfberry, codonopsis pilosula, and astragalus membranaceus. By the end of September, the annual export plan for wolfberry had been overfulfilled by 21.33%, and astragalus membranaceus by 27%.
    This year, trading companies in the Northwest region have also actively conducted investigation and research, and have newly discovered many areas and varieties of medicinal materials. For example, the Weinan Trading Company in Shaanxi Province previously only knew that Heyang and Chengcheng counties in the area produced polygala tenuifolia. After conducting in-depth investigations in some mountainous areas of the second and third districts of Weinan County, it was found that these areas also produce polygala tenuifolia, and the annual output is not small. In addition, there are more than 20 kinds of medicinal materials such as scutellaria baicalensis, sanguisorba officinalis, and pueraria lobata. In the third quarter of this year, the Gansu Province Trading Company investigated and discovered more than 30 kinds of medicinal materials that had not been managed before. Trading companies in various places are actively purchasing these new commodities. (Fang Chengjie)

    西北各地贸易公司努力经营国产药材
    西北区各地贸易公司大力开展药材经营工作，已有不少成绩。今年一月到九月份收购药材的总值，已经接近一九五三年全年的收购总值，比一九五零年增加十二倍；其中大黄、甘草、当归三种药材，在九个月中，共收进六百八十五万斤，比一九五三年全年增加百分之七点五三。
    西北地区的贸易公司采取了许多有效措施，加强药材经营工作。西安、兰州等主要城市都设立了药材批发部等专营药材的机构；各地今年经营的药材品种，一般都比去年增加一半或一倍以上。陕西省西乡县贸易公司今年增加了斑毛、参叶等五十四种过去从来没有经营过的药材；凤县贸易公司经营药材的品种已由四十种增加到一百三十二种。青海省贸易公司今年八月间，从西安、兰州购进当归、猪苓、麦冬等价值十四亿余元的药材，制止了私商高价出售药材的现象，使药材能按合理价格大量供应。过去当地群众买一服普通中药要用四千元，现在只需要二千元。西安市贸易公司在今年第三季度曾派人到新疆、甘肃等地采购了大批药材，除积极供应国内需要外，还将一部分大黄、当归等药材用来出口。
    今年西北贸易公司组织出口的药材有猪苓、大黄、甘草、当归、枸杞、党参、红芪等二十多种。到九月底止，枸杞出口的年度计划已经超额完成百分之二十一点三三，红芪超额完成百分之二十七。
    西北地区的贸易公司今年还积极进行了调查研究工作，新发现了许多出产药材的地区和药材品种。如陕西省渭南贸易公司过去只知道该专区郃阳、澄城县出产远志，经深入渭南县第二、三区的一些山区地带进行调查以后，发现这些地区也产远志，而且年产量不小，另外，这里还出产黄芩、地榆、葛根等二十多种药材。甘肃省贸易公司在今年第三季度就调查发现了三十多种过去没有经营过的药材。这些新商品，各地贸易公司正积极进行收购。（方承杰）
