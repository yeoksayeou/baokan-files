    Books in the Soviet Union are the Property of the Masses
    A. Pujikov, Editor-in-Chief of the Soviet State Literary Publishing House
    The various achievements of the Soviet people in cultural construction are inextricably linked to the vigorous development of the Soviet book publishing industry. In the Soviet Union, books have become the property of the people, deeply rooted in the lives of Soviet people and disseminated to the farthest regions of the country. Books published by Soviet publishing houses are printed in a total of 119 languages, and the number of published copies has increased many times over. In 1953, the Soviet Union published approximately 962.2 million books and pamphlets, eleven times the number published in Tsarist Russia in 1913. The Soviet state has provided enormous possibilities for the publishing industry to meet the rapidly growing spiritual needs of Soviet people.

    We, who are engaged in the publication of literary books, have also keenly felt the need of the entire people for books. The output of our publishing house alone has increased from 3.2 million copies in 1940 to 38.3 million copies in 1954.

    Soviet readers love and are familiar with both Russian and translated classical and modern literary works. They have strict requirements for the selection, artistic decoration, and printing of published books. Therefore, the tasks facing the State Literary Publishing House are diverse.

    The large demand of Soviet readers for multi-volume sets of classical and modern writers also illustrates the continuous improvement of readers' cultural level. In the post-war period, the publishing house published 59 types of complete works in 441 volumes. The number of these publications has reached 41.77 million copies in the past nine years. Some writers, such as Gorky, Chekhov, Turgenev, Leo Tolstoy, Jack London, Qiu Li Weilen, and other classical writers, have had their complete works printed in editions of 300,000 to 400,000 copies each. All the complete works are published after particularly meticulous revisions, taking into account the latest achievements in textual research. The most famous Soviet scholars participate in the editing of the complete works.

    The State Literary Publishing House is publishing a large number of single editions of works by classical and Soviet writers. Some books are now printed in editions of one million copies. From 1946 to 1953, Gorky's works were published in 18.31 million copies, Leo Tolstoy's in 15.75 million copies, Pushkin's in 11.8 million copies, Chekhov's in 11.6 million copies, Gogol's in 10.95 million copies, and Turgenev's in 10.5 million copies.

    The publication of series such as the "State Literary Publishing House Mass Series" and the "Soviet Novel Library" occupies a significant position in our plans.

    During the era of Soviet power, the literature of the Soviet brother republics has made tremendous achievements. Many nationalities in the Soviet Union did not have their own written languages before the Great October Socialist Revolution, but now they have all made outstanding contributions to the socialist cultural cause. In the post-war period, 335 books translated from the languages of the Soviet nationalities into Russian have been published, totaling 15.2 million copies.

    Soviet readers are eager to understand the material and spiritual culture of various eras and nationalities, and therefore show great interest in foreign literary works. In order to meet readers' needs in this regard, the State Literary Publishing House is translating and publishing literary works from all five continents on a large scale. In 1954, works by writers from Britain, Australia, Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Germany, Denmark, Italy, Iceland, Spain, India, China, Korea, Poland, Romania, France, the United States, Czechoslovakia, Chile, and Japan were published in Russian. The publishing plan for foreign literary works in 1955 is even more ambitious.

    Our publishing house has an Eastern Literature Editorial Department, which enables us to more fully meet readers' needs for works by writers from Eastern countries. In the plans of this editorial department, the rich literary works of the great Chinese people for many centuries occupy a large proportion. In the last three years alone, works by Bai Juyi, Qu Yuan, Shi Nai'an, Luo Guanzhong, Pu Songling, Lu Xun, Guo Moruo, Ding Ling, and Lao She have been published. The publishing house has scheduled to publish more than 1.5 million copies of books by Eastern writers in 1955. These include the unfinished two volumes of Lu Xun's collected works, collections of short stories by Ba Jin, Zhang Tianyi, and Ye Shengtao, selections of Guo Moruo, Ding Ling, and Sima Qian, Du Fu's poems, Tang poetry, collections of short stories by Chinese writers, as well as works by writers from India, Korea, Japan, Turkey, and other countries.

    In the Soviet Union, books have become the property of the broadest masses of the people, serving the cause of peace, democracy, and socialism.

    书籍在苏联是群众的财产
    苏联国立文艺书籍出版社总编辑　阿·普吉科夫
    苏联人民在文化建设中的各项成就，都同苏联书籍出版事业的蓬勃发展有着不可分割的联系。在苏联，书籍已经成为人民的财产，它已牢固地深入到苏维埃人的生活之中，并传布到国内最远的地区。苏联各出版社出版的书籍，共用一百一十九种文字印刷，出版册数已经增加了许多倍。一九五三年苏联出版了约九万万六千二百万册书籍和小册子，为沙皇俄国一九一三年出版册数的十一倍。苏维埃国家为出版事业满足苏维埃人急剧增长的精神需要，提供了巨大的可能性。
    我们从事文艺书籍出版工作的人也显著地感到了全体人民对于书籍的需要。仅就我们一个出版社的出书量来说，就已从一九四○年的三百二十万册增加到了一九五四年的三千八百三十万册。
    苏联的读者们热爱和熟悉俄罗斯的和翻译过来的古典文艺作品和现代文艺作品。他们对出版书籍的选题、美术装饰和印刷的要求都是严格的。因此，国立文艺书籍出版社面临的任务是多种多样的。
    苏联读者对古典作家和现代作家的多卷集有着大量的需要，这也说明了读者的文化水平在不断提高。战后时期，出版社出版了五十九种计四百四十一卷这样的全集。这些出版物的册数九年来共达四千一百七十七万册。有些作家，如高尔基、契诃夫、屠格涅夫、列夫·托尔斯泰、杰克·伦敦、裘里·味纶以及其他一些古典作家的全集，各印行了三十万至四十万册。所有的全集都是参考了考据学方面的最新成就，经过特别细致的校订才出版的。参加全集的编辑工作的有苏联最著名的学者。
    国立文艺书籍出版社在大量地出版着古典作家和苏联作家作品的单行本。现在有些书一次就印行一百万册。从一九四六年到一九五三年，高尔基的作品出版了一千八百三十一万册，列夫·托尔斯泰的出版了一千五百七十五万册，普希金的出版了一千一百八十万册，契诃夫的出版了一千一百六十万册，果戈理的出版了一千零九十五万册，屠格涅夫的出版了一千零五十万册。
    “国立文艺书籍出版社大众丛书”和“苏联长篇小说文库”等丛书的出版，在我们的计划中占有显著的地位。
    在苏维埃政权的年代里，苏联各兄弟共和国的文学取得了巨大的成就。苏联的许多民族在伟大十月社会主义革命以前还没有本民族的文字，而现在它们都对社会主义文化事业作出了杰出的贡献。战后时期，由苏联各民族语言译为俄文出版的书籍有三百三十五种，共一千五百二十万册。
    苏联读者渴望了解各个不同时代各个不同民族的物质和精神文化，因而对外国文学著作表现了极大的兴趣。为了满足读者在这方面的需要，国立文艺书籍出版社正在大规模地翻译和出版全世界五大洲的文艺作品。一九五四年，英国、澳大利亚、阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、匈牙利、德国、丹麦、意大利、冰岛、西班牙、印度、中国、朝鲜、波兰、罗马尼亚、法国、美国、捷克斯洛伐克、智利、日本作家的作品，都在用俄文出版。一九五五年的外国文学作品出版计划更为庞大。
    我们出版社设有东方文学编辑部，它使我们能够更充分地满足读者对于东方各国作家作品的需要。在这个编辑部的计划中，伟大中国人民许多世纪以来丰富的文学作品占有很大的分量。仅在最近三年内，已有白居易、屈原、施耐庵、罗贯中、蒲松龄、鲁迅、郭沫若、丁玲、老舍的作品问世。出版社预订在一九五五年出版的东方作家的书籍在一百五十万册以上。其中有鲁迅文集未完成的两卷，巴金、张天翼、叶圣陶的短篇小说集，郭沫若、丁玲、司马迁的选集，杜甫诗集，唐诗，中国作家短篇小说集，以及印度、朝鲜、日本、土耳其和其他各国作家的作品。
    在苏联，书籍成了最广大的人民群众的财产，它是为和平事业、为民主和社会主义事业服务的。
