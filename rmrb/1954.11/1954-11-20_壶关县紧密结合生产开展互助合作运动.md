    Huguan County, Shanxi Province, vigorously implemented the guiding principles of "establishing cooperatives in production, and promoting production in establishing cooperatives" and "running agricultural cooperatives well and improving mutual aid teams." This resulted in significant achievements in developing agricultural production cooperatives and consolidating mutual aid teams, while also promoting current production. As of early November, all 203 newly established agricultural production cooperatives in the county had been completed, and the original 210-plus old cooperatives had also been appropriately expanded. New and old peasant households participating in agricultural production cooperatives accounted for 62.5 percent of the total number of households in the county. While developing agricultural production cooperatives, attention was paid to developing and consolidating mutual aid teams. According to statistics from 67 townships including Fangshan and Gucun, 538 mutual aid teams were consolidated and developed during the expansion of cooperatives, enabling the county's mutual aid and cooperation movement to take a major leap forward on the original basis.
    Due to the integration of these three aspects, the production movement was greatly promoted. In the autumn harvest, the 417 agricultural production cooperatives increased grain production by 314,800 jin (an average increase of more than 3 jin per mu) simply by improving harvesting methods and carefully collecting and threshing. A collective 35,800 mu of wheat was sown, 5,800 mu more than last year. According to statistics from 166 newly established cooperatives and 158 mutual aid teams, autumn plowing has reached 68,459 mu, accounting for 85 percent of the total autumn plowing area, of which 40 percent was plowed with new-style walking plows. The newly established agricultural production cooperatives have prepared an average of 40 dan of fertilizer per mu for next year, and the mutual aid teams have averaged 30 dan, while also paying attention to improving quality. Seventy newly established cooperatives have also begun to repair 1,038 zhang of field embankments, which is estimated to expand the cultivated area by more than 30 mu, greatly demonstrating the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives.

    壶关县紧密结合生产开展互助合作运动
    山西省壶关县大力贯彻“生产中建社，建社中生产”和“搞好农业社，提高互助组”的指导方针，使发展农业生产合作社和整顿互助组工作获得重大成绩，同时促进了当前生产。截至十一月上旬，全县新建的二百零三个农业生产合作社已全部建成，原有的二百一十多个老社，也有了适当扩大，参加农业生产合作社的新老农户占全县总农户的百分之六十二点五。在发展农业生产合作社的同时，注意了发展和整顿互助组工作，据方善、固村等六十七个乡统计，在扩建社中，整顿和发展了五百三十八个互助组，使全县互助合作运动在原来基础上，又大大地跃进了一步。
    由于三者结合，大大推动了生产运动。四百一十七个农业生产合作社，在秋收中仅改进收割方法、细收细打一项，即增产粮食三十一万四千八百斤（每亩平均增产三斤多）；集体播种小麦三万五千八百亩，比去年多种五千八百亩。另据一百六十六个新建社和一百五十八个互助组统计：秋耕地已达六万八千四百五十九亩，占到总秋耕地面积的百分之八十五，其中有百分之四十是用新式步犁耕的。新建农业生产合作社每亩已平均给明年准备好了四十担肥料，互助组平均达到三十担，同时还注意提高了质量。七十个新建社还开始修整了一千零三十八丈地堰，估计可扩大耕地面积三十余亩，大大显示了农业生产合作社的优越性。
