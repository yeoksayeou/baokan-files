　　The youth coal mining teams and tunneling teams of Jixi Coal Mine have continuously created excellent achievements in this year's labor emulation drive. The 204 Youth Coal Mining Team of Muleng Third Mine overproduced 425 tons of raw coal for the state in early November. From January to July of this year, they overproduced nearly a thousand tons of coal and completed thirteen and a half more cycles than the national plan. Since its establishment in January, the Youth Tunneling Team of Didao Eighth Mine has overfulfilled the national plan every month, excavating an extra 250 meters for the state in the first half of the year. The tunneling efficiency has increased by an average of 16 percent compared to the national plan. In October, due to difficulties with the "electric chute" equipment, the tunneling efficiency was greatly affected. However, through the efforts of all team members, they still overfulfilled the national plan by two meters by the end of the month. Due to these exemplary deeds, the team has received six awards from the Mining Bureau and the Mine since the beginning of this year.
　　In 1952, under the proposal and assistance of Soviet experts, Jixi Coal Mine established three youth coal mining teams in Muleng Mine. These youth coal mining teams were composed of Communist Youth League members and young workers as the backbone, supplemented by a certain number of veteran technical workers. This year, the Communist Youth League Jixi Mining Area Committee summarized and promoted the experience of Muleng Mine and organized eight youth coal mining teams, tunneling teams, and twenty youth coal mining groups and tunneling groups throughout the mining area. Several hundred Communist Youth League members and young workers voluntarily joined these teams and groups. Now, the glorious title of youth coal mining team and youth tunneling team has become the goal pursued by young workers throughout the mining area. (Xinhua News Agency)

    鸡西煤矿青年采煤队和掘进队
    在劳动竞赛中增产成绩优越
    鸡西煤矿的青年采煤队和掘进队在今年的劳动竞赛中，不断创造出优越的成就。穆棱三坑二零四青年采煤队在十一月上旬为国家超额增产了四百二十五吨原煤。他们在今年一月到七月里曾增产近千吨煤，并比国家计划多完成了十三个半循环。滴道八坑青年掘进队从一月成立到现在，月月都超额完成国家计划，上半年共为国家多掘进了二百五十公尺，掘进效率平均比国家计划提高百分之十六。十月份因为“电溜子”设备发生困难，曾大大影响掘进效率，可是这个队在全体队员的努力下，到月底仍然超额两公尺完成了国家计划。由于这种模范事迹，今年以来这个队已得到矿务局和矿的六次奖励。
    鸡西煤矿一九五二年在苏联专家的倡议和帮助下，曾在穆棱矿建立了三个青年采煤队。这些青年采煤队都是以青年团员、青年工人为骨干，另外配备一定数量的老技术工人组成的。今年，青年团鸡西矿区委员会总结和推广了穆棱矿的经验，在全矿区组成了八个青年采煤队、掘进队和二十个青年采煤小组和掘进小组。有好几百个青年团员和青年工人自愿参加了这些队和小组。现在，青年采煤队和青年掘进队的光荣称号已经成为全矿区的青年工人所追求的目标。（新华社）
