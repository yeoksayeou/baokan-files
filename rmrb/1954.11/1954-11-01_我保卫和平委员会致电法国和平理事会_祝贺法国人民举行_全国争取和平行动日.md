Xinhua News Agency, October 31st: On the eve of the French people's "National Day of Action for Peace" (October 31st), the China Peace Committee cabled the French National Peace Council to express congratulations. The text of the telegram is as follows:

French National Peace Council:

On the occasion of the French National Peace Council and the French people holding a "National Day of Action for Peace," the China Peace Committee, on behalf of the Chinese people, extends warm congratulations to the French National Peace Council, and through you, to the French people.

After victoriously conducting the struggle to restore peace in Indochina and oppose the "European Defense Community" planned by the United States, the French people are now facing another new and serious struggle against the London and Paris Agreements to re-openly arm West Germany and restore German militarism. These agreements fundamentally violate the interests of peace in Europe and the entire world, and will greatly deepen the threat of a new war in Europe and exacerbate the world's tense situation. Therefore, the French people's struggle is of great significance not only to France, but also to the peace and security of the entire Europe and the world. There is no doubt that the French people's "National Day of Action for Peace" will further promote and strengthen this struggle against rearming West Germany and safeguarding peace in Europe and the world, and will win the heartfelt support of hundreds of millions of peace-loving people around the world and the Chinese people.

For the sake of peace in Europe and the world, may the unity between the Chinese and French people be increasingly consolidated, may the French people's "National Day of Action for Peace" be successful, and may the French people's struggle against rearming West Germany achieve new successes.

    我保卫和平委员会致电法国和平理事会
    祝贺法国人民举行“全国争取和平行动日”
    【新华社三十一日讯】在法国人民举行“全国争取和平行动日”（十月三十一日）的前夕，中国人民保卫世界和平委员会致电法国全国和平理事会表示祝贺。电文如下：法国全国和平理事会：
    值此法国全国和平理事会和法国人民举行“全国争取和平行动日”之际，中国人民保卫世界和平委员会代表中国人民谨向法国全国和平理事会，并通过你会向法国人民表示热烈祝贺。
    在胜利地进行了为恢复印度支那和平和反对美国所策划的“欧洲防务集团”的斗争以后，法国人民现在正面临着反对伦敦及巴黎协定重新公开武装西德、恢复德国军国主义的又一次新的严重斗争。这些协定的目的是根本违反欧洲和整个世界的和平利益的，并将大大加深欧洲新战争的威胁、加剧世界的紧张局势，因而法国人民的这一斗争就不仅对法国，而且也对整个欧洲及世界的和平与安全，具有十分重大的意义。毫无疑义，法国人民“全国争取和平行动日”定将进一步推动和加强这一反对重新武装西德和维护欧洲及世界和平的斗争，并赢得全世界爱好和平的亿万人民和中国人民的衷心的支持。
    为了欧洲及世界的和平，祝中法两国人民的团结日益巩固，祝法国人民“全国争取和平行动日”获得成功，祝法国人民反对重新武装西德的斗争获得新的成就。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会
    一九五四年十月三十日
