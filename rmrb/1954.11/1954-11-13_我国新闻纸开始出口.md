Xinhua News Agency:

    China has begun exporting domestically produced newsprint. From September of this year to the present, China has exported 2,000 tons of newsprint to countries including the Republic of India and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam; the volume of exports will continue to increase in the future.
    For decades, China's newsprint needs have always depended on imports. Before liberation, annual imports of newsprint reached 70,000, 80,000 or even 100,000 tons. After several years of hard work by papermaking industry workers since liberation, China's newsprint production can not only basically guarantee self-sufficiency, but can also begin to be exported.

    我国新闻纸开始出口
    我国制造的新闻纸开始出口了。从今年九月到现在，我国已向印度共和国、越南民主共和国等输出新闻纸两千吨；今后的输出量将继续增加。
    几十年来，我国所需要的新闻纸从来都依赖进口。解放前每年输入的新闻纸达到七万、八万或十几万吨。经过解放后几年来造纸工业职工们的努力，我国新闻纸的生产不仅基本上已能保证自给，并可开始输出。　（新华社）
