Fujian Province's coastal state-owned grain departments, commercial departments, and supply and marketing cooperatives have transported large quantities of grain, non-staple foods, winter supplies, and daily necessities to various islands to ensure the needs of the military and civilians.

In addition to bulk grain, the supplies transported to the islands include large quantities of hogs, chickens, ducks, dried bamboo shoots, salted fish, pickles, vermicelli, lily flowers, oil, sugar, and other non-staple foods, as well as various canned foods and seasonal fruits. Firewood, charcoal, and liquors such as rice wine, yellow wine, and lychee wine for the military and civilians on the islands to keep warm have also been shipped in large quantities. Although Dadeng Island and Xiaodeng Island, which are only five to ten li away from Jinmen Island occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops, have been subjected to enemy shelling or bombing by planes almost every day recently, the supply and marketing cooperatives located in the tunnels are still open as usual, and the prices of various commodities are the same as those in the mainland.

    福建省各海岛物资供应充足
    福建省沿海各地国营粮食部门、商业部门以及供销合作社已将大批粮食、副食品、御寒用品和日用品运往各岛屿，以保证军、民需要。
    运到各海岛的物资除大宗粮食外，有大批毛猪、鸡、鸭、笋干、咸鱼、咸菜、粉丝、金针菜、油、糖等副食品和各种食品罐头、时新水果。供海岛军、民御寒用的木柴、木炭以及烧酒、黄酒、荔枝酒等也大量运到。离蒋贼军盘踞的金门岛只隔五华里到十多华里的大登岛和小登岛，最近虽然几乎每天都受到敌人炮击或飞机投弹轰炸，但是设在坑道中的供销合作社仍照常营业，各种商品价格都和内地相同。
