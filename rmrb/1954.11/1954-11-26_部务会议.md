Ministry Meeting
    Han Chuan
    The 48th Ministry Meeting started at 2 p.m.

    As usual, at 2:10 p.m., those attending the meeting began to enter the conference room; those presiding over the meeting had not yet arrived. The secretary specifically serving the meeting, also as usual, was on the phone in the telephone room urging:
      "Is that Director Zhang? -- Now..." Director Zhang's secretary answered the phone, saying the director was talking with a cadre and would be there soon.

    The duty officer at Director Wang's office told him that Director Wang had "just left!"

    The secretary dialed the phone a few more times:
      "Is Director Li there?"
      "This is he. This is he. -- What? ... A meeting? Ask for an hour's leave for me! ... There's an urgent matter, I'll be there in exactly one hour. ... One hour."

    Director Zhao threw a fit on the phone:
      "What's going on! -- The meeting is at two o'clock, and you're only delivering the notice to me now!"

    2:25 p.m. The Deputy Minister presiding over the meeting arrived wearing an overcoat. The Head of the Secretariat hurried to greet him and handed him a large stack of newly printed meeting documents. He hung his overcoat on the hanger with one hand and took the stack of meeting documents with the other, casually asking:
      "How is it? Are they all here?"

    "All --" The Head of the Secretariat's words were about to come out, but he suddenly changed his statement very alertly: "I'm urging them by phone! -- Some are already on their way."

    The Deputy Minister pushed open the door of the conference room, walked in, and said with infinite emotion:
      "It's still 'meeting at eight, all arrive at ten'!" He walked to the chairman's seat and pulled out the chair, which was half under the table.
      "How many items are on the agenda today?" he asked the Head of the Secretariat following behind him.
      "The Director of the General Office told me there are seven." The Head of the Secretariat continued: "There wasn't enough time to type, so only six documents were printed -- the remaining one is being rushed, about half an hour..."
    "Which one should we discuss first?" The Deputy Minister interrupted him.

    The Director of the General Office hadn't specified this, but since the Deputy Minister asked, the Head of the Secretariat couldn't not answer, so he said with great uncertainty: "In view of the situation, it should... but it's not certain."

    The Deputy Minister didn't expect him to offer any definite opinions and sat down to browse through the large stack of meeting documents. He read at a glance. The conference room seemed very quiet.

    It was almost three o'clock. Cars arrived one after another. Director Wang, Director Zhao, Director Zhang, and others, each with several attendants, received a large stack of meeting documents outside the door and walked into the conference room one after another. They nodded to the Deputy Minister, greeted each other, and then found their respective seats and sat down. Director Wang wanted to speak but noticed that the Deputy Minister was reading the documents and didn't dare to disturb him, so he found the documents related to him and began to read them. Director Zhang, seeing that everyone was "cramming at the last minute," also hurried to use the time, his eyes darting like lightning across the documents related to him.

    4:10 p.m. The Deputy Minister finished reading the large stack of documents in one breath and stretched himself:
    "How is it? Let's seize the time! Which one should we discuss first? -- Director Li has asked for an hour's leave, I think the question he raised should be put later!" He was asking and answering himself, inspiring other comrades to speak.

    "Should we discuss the 'regulations' we drafted first?" Director Zhao said, the lower levels are urging very urgently, with telegrams, long-distance calls, and now some provinces and cities have even sent people here. "It's already late to send it out immediately, it'll really be 'locking the stable door after the horse is stolen' if we delay any longer!"

    Director Zhang advocated discussing the instructions drafted by them on behalf of the ministry first, on the grounds that the instructions had already been discussed six times, and a total of nine times including text revisions:
    "This time, we should be able to roughly finalize it!"

    The Deputy Minister agreed with Director Zhang's opinion. However, apart from the Deputy Minister and Director Zhang, who had just read it once, none of the other comrades had looked at Director Zhang's instructions, so they had nothing to say. Thus, they were given fifteen minutes to read the document. The Deputy Minister and Director Zhang took this opportunity to do some polishing work on the text.

    4:30 p.m., the ministry meeting truly began. Director Zhao was still the first to speak. He said that on the second page, fourth line, "...therefore should develop..." was rather vague and should be changed to "therefore, must develop." The reason was that unclear attitudes from leading organs not only fail to help the comrades working below but also increase their difficulties.

    Director Zhang disagreed with Director Zhao's opinion. He believed that leading organs should not be overly affirmative in issuing instructions before the situation is clear, as "saying things definitively will make them passive in the future."

    "If you don't understand the situation, why issue instructions at all?" Director Zhao asked.
    "Don't deliberately try to catch my words!" Director Zhang was somewhat indignant, saying that he had said "situation is not yet clear," not "don't understand the situation." He advocated that this instruction "must be sent out." Because first, leading organs must issue instructions; second, the lower levels do need the instructions of the leading organs; and third, eight months ago, when he drafted the instructions on behalf of the ministry, he did have a grasp of the situation at the lower levels. It's just that the time has passed so long, he worries that "the situation may have changed now."

    Director Wang supported Director Zhang's argument, that the instructions must be sent out. If they are not sent out, eight or nine months of work will be wasted. He also worried that the situation at the lower levels might have changed. "However," he said, "discussions and research on directive documents take a certain amount of time."

    The other people attending the meeting, including those attending as observers, all expressed opinions within the range of "therefore," "should," "in view of this," and "must." Some people said this was nitpicking, while others absolutely refused to admit this. Each had their own views, and the debate was extremely heated. In addition, the waiter came in with a kettle to make tea, and the telephone operator came from time to time to find Director Wang and Director Zhang to answer the phone. The glass door of the conference room opened and closed, closed and opened again, with people coming and going, and the atmosphere was quite active. It was also at this time that the seventh document being rushed by the typist was delivered, and the Head of the Secretariat was busy distributing it on the conference table. However, the hour hand on the electric meter was already pointing to 5:26 p.m., and there were only four minutes left until the end of the workday. The ministry meeting had to end at this climax.

    "How is it?" The Deputy Minister tapped the table lightly with a pencil: "Let's end the meeting here!" When summarizing everyone's opinions, he said that "therefore should develop" was not perfect; but he also did not agree with using "therefore, must develop," he thought using "correspondingly develop" was more accurate: "What do you think!" He was soliciting everyone's opinions. The door of the conference room opened again. This time it wasn't the telephone operator or the waiter, but Director Li, who had asked for an hour's leave. Director Li rushed in, flustered, with a small briefcase. The Deputy Minister glanced at him:
      "Good! You made it just in time for the adjournment!" He did not excessively blame him but smiled and explained to him that there had not been enough time to discuss the issue he had submitted to the meeting today.

    "I was mentally prepared." Director Li was very prescient, but immediately pressed on: "Will it be discussed next time?"

    The Deputy Minister did not answer him. He turned and sat next to Director Zhao. The Head of the Secretariat handed him the documents. He weighed the large stack of documents and, guided by habit, very naturally opened his small briefcase and stuffed them all in. At this time, he was eager to know what issues the meeting had resolved, so he brought his mouth to Director Zhao's ear. Director Zhao allowed him to give him a "summary introduction" after the meeting, and only then did he straighten up and listen to the Deputy Minister's conclusion. Of course, this conclusion was incomprehensible to him. The person making the conclusion was saying "...be more cautious to make fewer mistakes..." entrusting the Head of the Secretariat to "make a final revision based on everyone's opinions...discuss it again at the next ministry meeting."

    "Other issues," the Deputy Minister stood up and said: "How about finding another time?"

    Before getting into the car, Director Li grabbed Director Zhao, insisting that he "fulfill" the "promise" he made at the meeting. Director Zhao hesitated and said that he could not give a "summary introduction" but could only vent some complaints. He said that ministry meetings like this were not run well because some comrades did not understand the situation themselves, and did not admit that they did not understand the situation, so they did not want to understand the situation, and in addition, they did not dare to believe that others understood the situation, so they became "cautious" and remained "cautious" to the point where they could not solve the problem. He estimated that the instructions drafted by Director Zhang and the others on behalf of the ministry "will not be sent out even after being discussed five more times." He said that today's ministry meeting was the same as usual. In his view, continuing to hold such meetings, first, one does not need to think, and everyone has the opportunity to rest their brains; second, everyone can avoid studying and will fall behind together in the future; third, it sets an example for general cadres: "Look! How busy our leaders are!" Fourth, ... His words were not finished, and Director Li realized that the mood was not right, so he stopped him halfway:
      "Fourth, let me say it for you: the people will say that we are bureaucratic, right? Maybe there are fifth and sixth; but with so many opinions, why don't you talk to the leadership!"

    "I have talked," Director Zhao paused and continued: "Habits become natural, it's not easy to change them all at once! I think that open criticism in the newspaper may have some effect..."

    These words were mostly heard by Director Zhang behind them. He took a few quick steps and inserted himself between the two of them, saying:
      "My views are completely different from Lao Zhao's. Ministry meetings to resolve policy issues must be held like this." He believed that the defect of today's meeting "is mainly that everyone's sense of time is a little off," patted Director Li's shoulder: "Especially you, Lao Li, you're simply 'coming for the adjournment, wasting gasoline'! It's better not to come at all."

    A sudden attack! Director Li could not accept it, and naturally could not remain silent, so he glared at Director Zhang and argued:
      "It's better to be late than not to come at all, right?"

    部务会议
    韩川
    下午两点开第四十八次部务会议。
    照例，两点十分，列席会议的人，先后走进了会议室；出席会议的人都还没有到。专门为会议服务的秘书，也照例在电话室里用电话催请：
      “张局长吗？——现在……”张局长的秘书接电话，说局长正在和一个干部谈话，马上就来。
    王主任办公室的值班员，告诉他王主任“刚走！”
    秘书把电话又拨了几下子：
      “李局长在吗？”
      “我就是。我就是。——什么？……开会？你替我请一个钟头的假吧！……有一件临时事情，过一个钟头准到。……一个钟头。”
    赵司长在电话里发了一通脾气：
      “怎么搞的！——两点开会，现在才把通知送给我！”
    两点二十五分。主持这次会议的副部长披着大衣走来，秘书处长赶紧迎上去，把一大叠刚印好的会议文件递给他，他一只手往衣架上挂大衣，一只手接过这一大叠会议文件，顺便问了一句：
      “怎么样？都来齐了吧？”
    “都——”秘书处长的话到嘴边，突然又非常机警地改变了说法：“正在用电话催呢！——有的已经在路上了。”
    副部长推开会议室的门，走进去，无限感慨地说：
      “还是‘八点开会，十点到齐’啊！”走到主席的位子上，把放在桌子下边半截的椅子拉出来。
      “今天几个议程啊？”又问跟在背后的秘书处长。
      “办公厅主任告诉我是七个。”秘书处长接着说：“打字来不及，只赶印了六个文件——剩下的那一个正在突击，大约半小时……”
    “先讨论哪一个？”副部长打断了他的话头。
    这件事办公厅主任没有交代，但副部长既然问到，秘书处长又不能不回答，于是他十分没有把握地说：“看情形，应该……但也不一定。”
    副部长并不指望他说出什么肯定的意见，坐下去浏览那一大叠会议文件。一目十行。会议室里显得非常肃静。
    快到三点了。汽车陆继开来，王主任、赵司长、张局长等，各带若干随员，在门外边都领到一大叠会议文件，一个接一个地走进了会议室。分别向副部长点过了头，又相互致意，然后分别找到自己的席位坐下来。王主任想说话，发现副部长正在阅读文件，没有好意思打扰他，便找出与自己有关的文件翻阅起来；张局长见大家都在“临阵磨枪”，自己也赶紧利用时间，目光跟闪电一样，在与自己有关的文件上奔驰。
    四点十分。副部长把那一大叠文件一口气读完了，伸了伸懒腰：
    “怎么样？抓紧时间吧！先讨论哪一个啊？——李局长请了一个钟头的假，我看他提的问题先放在后边吧！”他在自问自答，启发别的同志发言。
    “是不是先讨论我们搞的那个‘规定’？”赵司长说，下面催得很急，电报，长途电话，现在有的省、市还派了人来。“马上发出去就已经晚了，再拖就真正‘马后炮’了！”
    张局长主张先讨论他们代部拟稿的那份指示，理由是：那份指示已经讨论了六次，连文字修改一共讨论了九次：
    “这一次总可以大体定下来吧！”
    副部长同意了张局长的意见。但，张局长的那份指示，除副部长和张局长方才看过一遍以外；其他同志都没有翻看，因而无言可发，于是限十五分钟，看这份文件。副部长和张局长趁这个机会在文字上又做了些推敲工作。
    四点半，部务会议真正开始。仍旧是赵司长首先发言，他说第二页、第四行“……因而应该发展……”比较含糊，不如改为“因之，必须发展”。理由是：领导机关态度不明确，对下边工作的同志不但没有帮助，反而会增加他们的困难。
    张局长不同意赵司长的意见。他认为：领导机关在情况尚未弄清之前，往下发指示不宜过分肯定，“把话说死，将来是会被动的”。
    “不了解情况，还发什么指示呢？”赵司长问。
    “你不要故意抓人的话柄啊！”张局长有些愤愤然了，他说他方才说的是“情况尚未弄清”，没有说“不了解情况”。他主张这一指示“一定要发出去”。因为第一，领导机关必须发指示；第二，下面也确实需要领导机关的指示；第三，八个月以前，当他代部拟稿的时候，也确实掌握了下面的情况。只是时间过去的久了，他耽心“现在情况可能发生变化”。
    王主任支持张局长的论点，即指示一定要发。不发出去，八、九个月的功夫就白费了。他也耽心下边的情况会发生变化。“不过，”他说：“指示性的文件，讨论、研究是要花费一定的时间的。”
    其他出席会议、连同列席会议的人，都纷纷在“因而”、“应该”、“因之”、“必须”的范围内，发表意见。有的人说这是咬文嚼字，另外一部分人就无论如何不承认这一点。各有各的见解，争论极为热烈。再加上服务员提着水壶进来冲茶，电话员不时来找王主任和张局长他们去接电话，会议室的玻璃门开了关，关了又开，人来人往，气氛颇为活跃。也正在这时候，打字员突击的第七份文件送来了，秘书处长又忙着在会议桌上分发。但，电表上的时针，已经指向五点二十六分，再有四分钟就要下班了。而晚上副部长还有一个非出席不可的外交宴会。部务会议不得不在这高潮中结束。
    “怎么样？”副部长用铅笔轻轻的磕了磕桌子：“会议就开到这里吧！”他在归纳大家的意见时，说“因而应该发展”不十分完善；但他也不同意用“因之，必须发展”，他以为用“相应发展”比较确切一些：“你们看，怎么样！”他正在征询大家意见。会议室的门又开了，这次进来的不是电话员，也不是服务员，而是请了一个钟头假的李局长。李局长夹了一个小皮包慌慌张张地冲进来。副部长瞅了他一眼：
      “好！你赶上散会了！”没有过分地责难他，并含笑向他说明，今天没有来得及讨论他提交会议的问题。
    “我有精神准备。”李局长很有预见，但马上又逼紧了一句：“下一次能讨论吧？”
    副部长没有回答他。他转身坐到赵司长旁边，秘书处长把文件送给他，他掂了一掂这一大叠文件，习惯支配着他，非常自然地打开小皮包，一股脑儿地塞了进去。这时候他急于要知道会议究竟解决了些什么问题，因之把嘴凑到赵司长的耳朵边，赵司长允许他会后向他做一个“总结性的介绍”，他才把身子正过来听副部长的结论。当然这结论在他听来是莫名其妙的。做结论的人正在说“……稳重一些，可以少犯些错误……。”责成秘书处长根据大家的意见“做一次最后的修改……下次部务会议再讨论一次”。
    “其他问题，”副部长站起来说：“怎么样？另找时间吧！”
    没有上汽车以前，李局长拉住赵司长，硬要他“履行”在会议上的“诺言”。赵司长犹豫了一下，说他不能做“总结性的介绍”，只能发一些牢骚。他说这样的部务会议开不好，因为有一部分同志，自己不了解情况，又不承认不了解情况，因而也就不想了解情况，再加上不敢相信别人了解的情况，所以就“稳重”起来，一直“稳重”到不能解决问题的程度。他估计张局长他们代部拟稿的指示“再讨论五次也发不出去”。他说今天的部务会议和往常一样，据他看这样的会开下去，一、可以不用思想，大家有机会休息休息脑筋；二、可以都不学习，将来一齐落后；三、向一般干部做样子：“你们看！我们领导方面是多么紧张啊！”四、……他的话没有说完，李局长就听出情绪不对头来，便在半路里截住他：
      “第四，我替你说：人民会说我们是官僚主义，对不对？也许还有第五、第六；可是有这样多的意见，你为什么不找领导上谈一谈呢！”
    “谈过，”赵司长把话顿了一顿，接下去说：“习惯成自然，不容易一下子扭过来啊！我看，在报上公开批评一下，也许会起些作用哩……”
    这些话被背后的张局长听到了一大半，他紧走了几步，插在他俩中间，说：
      “我的看法跟老赵完全不同，解决方针政策性的部务会议，就得像今天这样的开法。”他认为今天会议的缺陷“主要是大家的时间观念差一些”，拍了拍李局长的肩膀：“尤其你老李，简直是‘赶来散会，浪费汽油’！不如干脆不来。”
    突然袭击！李局长不能接受，当然也就不能缄默，便瞪着眼睛与张局长辩驳：
    “迟到总比不到要好得多吧？”
