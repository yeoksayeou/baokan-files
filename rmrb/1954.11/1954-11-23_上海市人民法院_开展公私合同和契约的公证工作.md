    Shanghai People's Court
    Carries Out Notarization Work for Public-Private Contracts and Agreements
    The Shanghai People's Court has decided to universally carry out notarization work for public-private contracts and agreements starting in late November.
    In the first half of the year, the Shanghai People's Court focused on carrying out notarization work for processing and ordering contracts at the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of the China National Pharmaceutical Corporation. Through notarization, legal education was conducted for capitalists, the authenticity and legality of the contracts were reviewed, and the rights and obligations of both parties to the contract, as well as the legal responsibilities for violating the contract, were specified in the contract. After the contracts were performed, there was a significant reduction in the phenomena of capitalists falsely reporting costs, cutting corners, and delaying delivery in violation of the contract. At the same time, it promoted the improvement of the procurement system of state-owned enterprises.
    However, there are many private factories in Shanghai undertaking state processing orders, exclusive sales, and purchasing businesses (currently estimated at over 8,500), and the variety of products produced is also very complex. The phenomenon of many capitalists violating contracts by delaying deliveries and producing shoddy goods is quite serious. For example, before September of this year, the quantity of machine screws ordered by the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of the China National Hardware Corporation from private factories with delayed delivery reached more than 37%; in August, the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of the China National Department Store ordered a batch of enamelware, and there were 1,100 incidents of illegal capitalists passing off substandard goods as good goods in violation of the contract. All of these affect the planned production and planned supply of state-owned enterprises. In order to further leverage the role of the notarization system in safeguarding national economic construction, the Shanghai People's Court has instructed the People's Courts of the Old Zha, Huangpu, Xincheng, Jiangning, Yulin, and Changning districts to handle the notarization of public-private contracts in their respective regions. The Shanghai People's Court will directly be responsible for gradually carrying out the notarization of processing and ordering contracts and agreements of the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of the China National Department Store and the Shanghai Municipal Trade Trust Company.

### 上海市人民法院  开展公私合同和契约的公证工作

    上海市人民法院
    开展公私合同和契约的公证工作
    上海市人民法院决定自十一月下旬起，普遍开展公私合同、契约的公证工作。
    上海市人民法院曾于上半年在中国医药公司上海采购供应站重点进行加工订货契约的公证工作，通过公证，对资本家进行了守法教育，审查了契约的真实性和合法性，并在契约上载明订约双方对契约的权利和义务及违反契约应负的法律责任。契约履行后，资本家虚报成本、偷工减料、违约延期的现象显著减少，同时推动了国营企业改进采购制度。
    但是，上海市承接国家加工订货、包销、收购业务的私营工厂很多（据目前估计约有八千五百余家），所制产品的品种也很复杂，而不少资本家在履行合同中违约延期、粗制滥造的现象相当严重。如中国五金公司上海采购供应站今年九月份以前向私营工厂订购的机器螺丝延期交货的数量达百分之三十七以上；中国百货公司上海采购供应站八月份订购搪瓷用品一批，不法资本家以次货充好货违约事件达一千一百次。所有这些，都影响到国营企业的计划生产和计划供应。上海市人民法院为进一步发挥公证制度在保障国家经济建设方面的作用，已指示老闸、黄浦、新成、江宁、榆林、长宁等区人民法院办理所在地区的公私契约公证，上海市人民法院将直接负责逐步开展中国百货公司上海采购供应站及上海市贸易信托公司的加工订货合同、契约的公证工作。
