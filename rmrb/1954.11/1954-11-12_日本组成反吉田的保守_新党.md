Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 11th: News from Tokyo: After a meeting on the 10th, the leading figures of the anti-Yoshida group within the Liberal Party, Ichiro Hatoyama, and the president of the Progressive Party, Mamoru Shigemitsu, issued a joint statement formally announcing the formation of a conservative "New Party" opposing Yoshida on November 23rd. Also participating in the meeting between Hatoyama and Shigemitsu were Takeji Miki, representative of the Japanese Liberal Party, and other leaders of the "New Party" movement. The joint statement by Hatoyama and Shigemitsu signifies another open split within the ruling Liberal Party and the conservative parties, deepening the crisis in Japan's unstable political situation.

The "New Party" members made this decision after the Liberal Party expelled Tanzan Ishibashi and Nobusuke Kishi, who were in charge of the preparatory work for the "New Party," from the Liberal Party on the 8th. This measure by the Liberal Party was originally intended to suppress the "New Party" movement. Prior to this, the pro-Yoshida group within the Liberal Party had engaged in intense behind-the-scenes activities, attempting to obstruct the preparatory work for the "New Party" and delaying it until Yoshida returned from the United States with "capital," in order to regain leadership of the "New Party." However, such attempts were opposed by the "New Party" members who sought to seize power from Yoshida.

According to foreign news agencies, it is estimated that around 40 members of the Diet's House of Representatives will leave the Liberal Party and join the "New Party" following Ichiro Hatoyama. Currently, the Liberal Party has only 225 seats in the House of Representatives, which is less than half of the total 466 seats. In addition, the Progressive Party holds more than 70 seats in the House of Representatives, and the Japan Liberal Party has eight seats. Kyodo News reported that after the Liberal Party decided to expel Tanzan Ishibashi and others, the Japanese financial community was concerned that the development of the "New Party" issue might lead to serious political instability and increase the possibility of dissolving the Diet and holding new general elections within this year.

### 日本组成反吉田的保守“新党”

    日本组成反吉田的保守“新党”
    【新华社十一日讯】东京消息：自由党内反吉田集团的首脑人物鸠山一郎和改进党总裁重光葵在十日举行会谈后，发表联合声明正式宣布将在十一月二十三日组成一个反对吉田的保守“新党”。参加鸠山和重光会谈的还有日本自由党代表三木武吉等其他“新党”运动首脑。鸠山和重光的联合声明标志着执政的自由党以及保守党派的再度公开分裂，加深了动荡不安的日本政局的危机。
    “新党”分子的这个决定，是在自由党在八日开除了“新党”筹备工作负责人石桥湛山、岸信介的自由党党籍以后作出的。自由党的这个措施原来是要借此镇压“新党”运动的。在这以前，自由党亲吉田集团曾进行过紧张的幕后活动，企图阻挠“新党”的筹备工作，拖延到吉田从美国带回“资本”以后，夺回“新党”的领导权。但是，这样的企图遭到力图同吉田夺取政权的“新党”分子的反对。
    据外国通讯社报道，估计追随鸠山一郎退出自由党而参加“新党”的国会众议员将有四十人左右。目前自由党在众议院只有二百二十五席，已不到众议院全部四百六十六席的半数。此外，改进党在众议院占有七十多席，日本自由党八席。共同社说，日本金融界在自由党决定开除石桥湛山等人后担心，“新党”问题的发展可能导致严重的政局不稳，并增加在今年以内解散国会重新举行大选的可能性。
