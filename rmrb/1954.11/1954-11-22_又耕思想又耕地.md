Newspaper Review

    Cultivating Thought and Cultivating Land
      The Hebei Daily published an article on November 2nd:
  "When the Tractor Came." This article vividly reflects the changes that the appearance of tractors has brought to farmers' lives and thoughts.
  The section "Cultivating Thought and Cultivating Land" tells people how the emergence of tractors promoted the growth and consolidation of farmers' cooperative ideas. On September 18th, the tractor arrived in Ge Village. Before the tractor even tilled the land, it began to till the farmers' minds. Everyone saw that to achieve mechanization, cooperation was necessary, and to use tractors, they had to join agricultural production cooperatives. Farmers who were afraid of losing out by joining the cooperative last year actively requested to join this year. Members who had considered withdrawing from the cooperative no longer wanted to withdraw after seeing the tractor. Thus, before the autumn harvest this year, Ge Village, West Cui, and East Cui had achieved cooperation, and all households except for five rich peasant households had joined the cooperatives. On the other hand, the emergence of tractors also promoted the shaking of farmers' private ownership concepts. The article introduced the fact that among the lands of the Ge Village, West Cui, and East Cui agricultural production cooperatives to be cultivated by machines this year, 532 mu were "interspersed lands" with other villages, which could not be cultivated without adjustment. In the past, it was a very difficult thing to get farmers to exchange land, but this time, because all villages were agricultural production cooperatives and tractors had arrived, the land was exchanged smoothly according to the principle of "mutual benefit." Mulberry trees on land boundaries are something farmers valued very much. In the past, they would not allow anyone to touch them, but now many farmers see them as obstacles to agricultural cooperation and mechanization and automatically uproot them. The article also tells people how farmers deepened their understanding of the worker-peasant alliance by seeing the tractor. They said, "We sell grain to the state to support national industrialization, the state builds factories, and workers make tractors and daily necessities for us. Isn't this a worker-peasant alliance?" It is very clear that the appearance of tractors has already brought and is continuing to bring significant changes to farmers' lives and thoughts.
    With the development of the agricultural cooperation movement and the display of the superiority of agricultural mechanization, more and more new atmospheres will appear in rural areas, and farmers' socialist ideas will continue to grow. Newspapers pay close attention to the emergence of these new things and reflect them vividly and actively, which will be a practical education and a powerful encouragement to the vast number of farmers.

    又耕思想又耕地
      十一月二日的河北日报上，刊登了一篇通讯：
  “拖拉机来的时候”。这篇通讯生动地反映了拖拉机的出现，在农民生活和思想上所引起的变化。
  通讯在“又耕思想又耕地”的一节中就告诉人们，拖拉机的出现怎样促进了农民合作化思想的成长巩固。九月十八日，拖拉机来到了葛村。拖拉机还没有耕地，却开始耕着农民的思想了。大家看到，要想机械化就要合作化，要想用上拖拉机就要参加农业生产合作社。去年怕入社吃亏的农民，今年主动要求加入了。曾经想退社的社员，见到拖拉机再也不想退社了。这样，在今年秋前，葛村、西崔和东崔三个村已经实现合作化，除去五户富农外，所有的农户已全部入社。在另一方面，拖拉机的出现，也促进了农民私有观念的动摇。通讯中介绍了这样的事实：今年要实行机耕的葛村、西崔、东崔三个农业生产合作社的土地中，有五百三十二亩是和外村的“插花地”，如果不调换一下，就无法耕种。过去，让农民换地是一件非常艰难的事情，但是这次因为一来各村都是农业生产合作社，二来又来了拖拉机，就很顺利地根据“互不吃亏”的原则把土地换过了。地界上的桑棵，是农民十分重视的东西，过去他们不允许任何人动它一动，但是现在很多农民却把它看成农业合作化和机械化的障碍而自动地把它刨掉了。通讯还告诉人们，农民们怎样因为看到拖拉机而加深了对工农联盟的认识，他们说：“我们把粮食卖给国家，支持国家工业化，国家开工厂，工人给我们造拖拉机，造日用品，这还不是工农联盟吗？”十分明显，拖拉机的出现已经而且正在使农民生活和思想发生着重大的变化。
    随着农业合作化运动的开展，随着农业机械化优越性的显示，农村中将出现愈来愈多的新的气象，农民的社会主义思想也将不断地成长。报纸密切地注意这些新事物的萌芽，把它生动、活泼地反映出来，对于广大农民将是一种实际的教育和有力的鼓舞。（陆占）
