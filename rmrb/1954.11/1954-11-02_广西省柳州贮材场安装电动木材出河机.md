    Electric Timber Extraction Machine Installed at Liuzhou Timber Yard, Guangxi Province

    The electric timber extraction machine at the Liuzhou Timber Yard of the Guangxi Forestry Industry Bureau has been installed and officially put into production on October 18th. According to the test run results and the first day's production statistics, this extraction machine, operating at slow speed, can extract 400 to 500 cubic meters of timber per day in eight hours, equivalent to the workload of over 400 manual laborers. As workers become more skilled in technical operation and the driving speed increases, the extraction volume can be greatly improved.

    After Soviet experts proposed the installation of an electric timber extraction machine in June of last year, the yard actively carried out preparatory work. Installation began in April of this year. During the installation process, the yard received assistance and support from relevant departments across the country. The Harbin Tool Factory of the Northeast Forestry Industry Administration supplied the electric timber extraction machine, and the Central South Forestry Industry Administration and the Hunan and Jiangxi Provincial Sub-bureaus sent engineers and technicians for technical guidance. Workers from the Liuzhou Power Plant also frequently came to the yard to help troubleshoot electrical and mechanical faults. The staff participating in the capital construction of the yard demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity, putting forward rationalization proposals such as "modifying hand trucks," which ensured the complete completion of the installation project before National Day.

    The installation of the electric extraction machine at the Liuzhou Timber Yard will enable the rapid removal and processing of large quantities of timber from the upper reaches of the Liu River, the Damiao Mountains, the Xing'an Wupai River, and the southern Guizhou forestry areas at the yard, supplying timber for local use in Guangxi Province, and transporting it to various parts of the country to support national industrial construction.

    广西省柳州贮材场安装电动木材出河机
    广西森林工业局柳州贮材场电动木材出河机安装竣工，并于十月十八日正式投入生产。根据试车结果和第一天生产的统计，这种出河机只开慢车速度，每天八小时的木材出河量可达四百到五百立方公尺，相当于四百多人工的工作量。工人技术操作熟练，开车速度加快后，出河量还可大大提高。
    去年六月间，苏联专家提出安装电动木材出河机建议后，该场即积极进行准备工作。今年四月开工安装。在安装工程中，该场得到全国各地有关部门的帮助和支持。东北森林工业管理局哈尔滨工具厂供应了电动木材出河机，中南森林工业管理局和湖南、江西等省分局都派工程师和技术人员来进行技术指导，柳州市电厂工人也经常到该场协助排除电气和机械部分的故障，该场参加基本建设的职工更发挥了高度积极性和创造性，提出了“改装手车”等合理化建议，保证了安装工程在国庆节前夕全部竣工。
    柳州贮材场电动出河机的安装，将使广西省柳江上游大苗山等地、兴安五排河和贵州南部等林区的大量木材迅速在该贮场起岸加工，供应广西省地方用材，并运送全国各地，支援国家工业建设。
