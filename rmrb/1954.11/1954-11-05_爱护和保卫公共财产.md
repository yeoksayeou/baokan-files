    Cherishing and protecting public property is an idea that has not yet been universally established among all state personnel and the people. Some people still believe that public property has nothing to do with them, so they do not cherish public goods when using them, and they do not economize when using state funds. Some state organs, state-owned enterprises, and cooperative agencies are bloated and overstaffed, which increases state expenditures; some are extravagant in internal equipment and life in the organs to show off, squandering public funds at will, and damaging public property arbitrarily. In industrial and mining enterprises and basic construction sites, many employees and the masses do not cherish machines and tools, do not save raw materials, and many useful materials and equipment are piled up randomly, exposed to the sun and rain, and gnawed by rats and insects. In state-owned factories and mines, some employees are careless in production, do not abide by labor discipline, and violate operating and safety procedures without authorization, causing accidents, producing a large number of defective products and wastes, damaging production equipment, and even causing personal injuries and deaths. In state-owned enterprises, production and construction units, and cooperatives, mismanagement, poor planning, and irresponsibility have resulted in the accumulation of funds, raw materials, and commodities, or the deterioration of goods due to improper storage, which has caused many unnecessary losses to state property. These phenomena urgently need to be overcome.
    Through the education of the "Three-Anti" movement, the phenomena of corruption and theft among our state personnel have been greatly reduced, but there are still some staff members who embezzle public funds and steal public property for their personal gain and to pursue a corrupt life. Through the education of the "Five-Anti" movement, more private industrialists and businessmen have improved their ideological understanding, but there are still some illegal capitalists who continue to evade state taxes, cut corners, and steal and defraud state assets in order to pursue exorbitant profits. These are all criminal acts that damage the public interest. In addition, because a considerable number of staff in organs, enterprises, and cooperatives lack the concept of cherishing public property and do not pay attention to preventing special agents, thieves, and fire, there are still a group of habitual thieves and other bad elements left over from the old society who can make a living by stealing public property. Among the theft and fraud cases that have occurred in various places, cases of theft of public property account for a large proportion. These phenomena are even more intolerable.
    Article 101 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China stipulates: "The public property of the People's Republic of China is sacred and inviolable. It is the duty of every citizen to cherish and protect public property." In order to effectively implement this provision among state personnel and the people, and to quickly eliminate the above-mentioned phenomena of waste, damage, and destruction of public property, our party committees at all levels, state organs at all levels, and mass organizations should regard educating state personnel and the people to cherish and protect public property as a regular and major task. Everyone should understand that public property is the material basis for our people to build a socialist society and the source of national prosperity and people's happiness. Therefore, in our country, cherishing and protecting public property is completely consistent with individual interests.
    The reason why our country has been able to gradually improve the material and cultural life of the working people and hold various social welfare undertakings for the working people to enjoy in the past five years is because the socialist economy has developed rapidly and public property has increased and expanded. Now our country's constitution has fixed the political, economic, and cultural and educational rights obtained by the people in law. If the people of our country are to better enjoy these rights, they must fulfill their due obligations, and cherishing and protecting public property is one of the most important. Because only when every citizen cherishes every tree and grass of the state or the cooperative can all public property be effectively used to develop the state-owned economy and the cooperative economy to accelerate the socialist construction of our country, and can it be effectively used to serve the people and further improve the material and cultural life of the people on the basis of developing production. Anyone who infringes on the public property of the state or the cooperative damages the current interests of the state and the people and damages the great cause of our people in building a socialist society.
    In our country, although there are still individual laborers' ownership economies and capitalist ownership economies based on the private ownership of the means of production today, there are already powerful socialist economies based on public ownership, namely the state-owned economy of ownership by the whole people and the cooperative economy of collective ownership by the working people. In order to consolidate and develop the socialist economy, we must declare that public property is sacred and inviolable and stipulate that cherishing and protecting public property is a solemn civic duty.
    To cherish and protect public property, the first requirement is to practice strict economy and oppose waste. All state organs, state-owned enterprises, and cooperatives should cultivate a mindset of careful calculation, diligence and frugality, and cherishing public property. Everyone should realize that a huge amount of funds is needed for economic construction, especially for the construction of the country's heavy industry; and the main source of funds is relying on our people to implement internal accumulation. Therefore, the improvement of the lives of our people in the future must be adapted to the development of the country's production and construction, and should not demand excessive enjoyment at present; on the other hand, all state organs must implement the strictest system of economy, and must resolutely oppose extravagance and waste in both administrative expenses and production and construction undertakings, rationally use existing funds, and no one should damage public property. Further strengthen labor discipline in factories and mining enterprises, so that every employee can consciously abide by labor discipline and various operating procedures, thereby reducing defective products and waste products and improving production efficiency. The good habit of cherishing public property should be cultivated among the people, so that everyone can rationally arrange their own lives and save their surplus money to support the country's industrial construction. At present, because some schools have neglected to educate young people on diligence, frugality, and cherishing public property, many young students have acquired bad habits such as belittling labor, advocating vanity, damaging public property, and squandering waste. All schools should also pay attention to correcting them.
    Cherishing and protecting public property also requires every citizen to resolutely fight against all criminal acts of corruption, theft, and destruction of public property. All enemies of the people—special agents, spies, and assassins sent by foreign imperialists, counter-revolutionaries who have escaped the net in the country, and other reactionary elements and hooligans—are bound to drill into, and some have already drilled into, our factories, mines, construction sites, cooperatives, and state organs and state-owned enterprises, taking advantage of our ideological麻痹carelessness and lack of concern for public property, and taking advantage of the shortcomings and errors in our work, seizing the opportunity to embezzle and steal public property, and even setting fire to our factories, warehouses, and various public buildings, blowing up our machines, railways, bridges, and other important projects, and destroying agricultural production and water conservancy facilities. In addition, there are still some people who are embezzling and stealing state property. Therefore, state organs at all levels, state-owned enterprises, and cooperatives must heighten their vigilance, tighten various work systems, and block all loopholes that can be used by counter-revolutionary elements and other destructive elements. The People's Courts, the People's Procuratorates, and the People's Public Security Organs should regard protecting public property as the basic content of further implementing the people's democratic legal system in the future, raise the struggle against corruption and theft to the principled height of safeguarding socialist economic construction, and give all corrupt and thieves and those who tolerate or harbor corruption and theft the punishment they deserve. These state organs should further improve and improve their work in order to discover and effectively punish corrupt and thieves in a timely manner; at the same time, and more importantly, they should educate the people and state personnel through various effective methods to further establish the concept of cherishing and protecting public property and actively fight against corruption and theft.
    We have the conditions to continuously win the victory in this struggle. Our party and the people's government, while leading the people to build and expand the socialist economy, have constantly educated the people to cherish and protect public property, so that the broad masses of the people have gradually established new concepts and new attitudes towards public property. Many state personnel and employees not only cherish public property very much when using it, take great care of production equipment, and try to save raw materials when using them; and have stubbornly fought against various criminal acts of damaging public property and various natural disasters in order to protect public property. Some people, in order to expose corruption, theft, and waste, although they have been attacked by bad elements, they have finally achieved victory through unyielding struggle; some people have been beaten to death and injured by the enemy in order to protect the factory and catch special agents; some people have bravely rescued public property in emergency situations and have been seriously injured and even disabled. As long as we further promote the enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people, everyone actively participates in production and construction, and everyone cherishes and protects public property, we will definitely be able to eliminate all phenomena of destruction, damage, theft, and waste of public property!

    爱护和保卫公共财产
    爱护和保卫公共财产的观念，还没有在所有的国家工作人员和人民群众中普遍地树立起来。有一部分人至今认为公共财产同自己无关，在使用公物时不爱护，在使用国家的资金时不节约。一部分国家机关、国营企业和合作社的机构臃肿，人浮于事，增加了国家的开支；有的为了讲究排场，在机关内部的设备和生活上十分铺张浪费，对公款任意挥霍，对公物任意损坏。在工矿企业和基本建设工地中，也有不少职工群众不爱护机器和工具，使用原材料不节约，许多有用的物资器材乱堆乱放，任随日晒雨淋和鼠咬虫蚀。在国营厂矿中，有些职工在生产时马马虎虎，不遵守劳动纪律，擅自违反操作规程和安全规程，造成事故，出产了大批次品和废品，损坏了生产设备，甚至造成人身伤亡。在国营企业部门、生产建设单位和合作社中，因经营管理不善、计划不周和不负责任而造成资金、原料和商品的积压，或因保管不善致使物品发生霉烂变质等现象，又给国家财产造成了许多不应有的损失。这些现象是亟需克服的。
    经过“三反”运动的教育，我们的国家工作人员中的贪污、盗窃的现象已经大大减少，但是至今也还有一部分工作人员为了个人的私利，为了追求腐化的生活而侵吞公款，盗窃公共财物。经过“五反”运动的教育，私营工商业中有更多的人提高了思想认识，但是至今也还有部分不法资本家为了追逐暴利而继续偷漏国税、偷工减料和盗窃诈骗国家资财，这些都是损害公共利益的犯罪行为。另外，由于有相当多的机关、企业和合作社的工作人员缺乏爱护公共财产的观念，不注意防特务、防盗匪和防火工作，所以至今还有一批旧社会遗留下来的惯盗、惯窃等坏分子能够以偷窃公共财产为生。在各地发生的盗窃、诈骗案件中，盗窃公共财产的案件占着很大的比重。这些现象更是不能容忍的。
    中华人民共和国宪法第一百零一条规定：“中华人民共和国的公共财产神圣不可侵犯。爱护和保卫公共财产是每一个公民的义务。”为了有效地把这一规定贯彻到国家工作人员和人民群众中去，迅速地消除上述各种浪费损害公共财产和破坏公共财产的现象，我们的各级党委、各级国家机关和群众团体，都应该把教育国家工作人员和人民群众爱护和保卫公共财产当作一项经常的重大的任务。要使每一个人都了解：公共财产是我国人民建设社会主义社会的物质基础，也是国家富强和人民幸福生活的源泉，因此在我们的国家里，爱护和保卫公共财产是同个人的利益完全一致的。
    我国五年来所以能够逐步改善劳动人民的物质生活和文化生活，举办各种社会福利事业以供劳动人民享受，就是因为社会主义经济有了迅速的发展，公共财产有了增加和扩大的缘故。现在我国的宪法已经把人民所获得的政治上、经济上和文化教育上的权利用法律固定下来。我国人民要能更好地享受这些权利，就必须尽应尽的义务，而爱护和保卫公共财产，就是其中最重要的一项。因为只有每一个公民都十分爱护和珍惜国家的或合作社的一草一木，才能使一切公共财物有效地用来发展国营经济和合作社经济以加速我国社会主义的建设事业，也才能有效地用来为人民服务，在发展生产的基础上，更加提高人民的物质生活和文化生活。任何人如果侵犯了国家的或合作社的公共财产，就是损害了国家和人民当前的利益，损害了我国人民建设社会主义社会的伟大事业。
    在我们国家里，今天虽然还有以生产资料私有制为基础的个体劳动者所有制的经济和资本家所有制的经济；但是已经有了以公有制为基础的强有力的社会主义经济，即全民所有制的国营经济和劳动群众集体所有制的合作社经济。为了巩固和发展社会主义的经济，我们就必须宣布公共财产神圣不可侵犯，并且把爱护和保卫公共财产规定为庄严的公民义务。
    爱护和保卫公共财产，首先是要求厉行节约，反对浪费。一切国家机关、国营企业和合作社都要养成一种精打细算、勤俭朴素和爱惜公物的思想作风。要使每一个人都认识到：为了进行经济建设，特别是为了建设国家的重工业，是需要巨大数量的资金的；而资金的主要来源是依靠我国人民实行内部的积累。因此，我国人民今后生活的改善，必须和国家的生产建设的发展相适应，不应该在目前要求过高的享受；另一方面，一切国家机关还必须实行最严格的节约制度，不论在行政费的开支上或生产建设事业上，都必须坚决反对铺张浪费，合理地使用现有的资金，并且任何人都不应毁坏公物。在厂矿企业中进一步加强劳动纪律，使每一职工都能自觉地遵守劳动纪律和各种操作规程，借以减少次品废品，提高生产效率。在人民群众中应该培养爱护公物的良好习惯，使每一个人都能合理地安排自己的生活，把多余的钱储蓄起来，用以支援国家的工业建设。目前由于部分学校忽略了对于青年进行勤俭节约和爱护公共财产的教育，有不少青年学生染上了轻视劳动、崇尚虚荣、毁坏公物、挥霍浪费等不良作风，各个学校也都应该注意纠正。
    爱护和保卫公共财产，还要求每个公民坚决地和一切贪污、盗窃和破坏公共财产的犯罪行为作斗争。一切人民的敌人——外国帝国主义派遣来的特务、间谍、暗害者，国内漏网的反革命分子以及其他反动分子和流氓分子，必然要钻进，有的已经钻进了我们的工厂、矿山、建设工地、合作社以及国家机关和国营企业部门，利用我们思想上的麻痹大意和对公共财产的不够关心，利用我们工作中的缺点和错误，乘机贪污、盗窃公共财产，甚至放火焚烧我们的工厂、仓库和各种公共建筑，炸毁我们的机器、铁路、桥梁和其他重要工程，破坏农业生产和水利设施。此外，还有一些人仍在贪污和盗窃国家的财产。因此，各级国家机关、国营企业部门和合作社必须提高警惕，严密各种工作制度，堵塞一切可以为反革命分子和其他破坏分子利用的空隙。人民法院、人民检察机关和人民公安机关应该把保卫公共财产当作今后进一步贯彻人民民主法制的基本内容，把反对贪污、反对盗窃的斗争提高到保卫社会主义经济建设的原则高度，分别给予一切贪污、盗窃分子以及那些容忍或包庇贪污盗窃行为的分子以应有的打击。这些国家机关应该进一步改进和提高自己的工作，以便及时发现和有效地惩治贪污、盗窃分子；同时更为重要的是应该通过各种有效方式，教育人民群众和国家工作人员进一步树立起爱护和保卫公共财产的观念，主动积极地同贪污盗窃行为作斗争。
    我们是有条件不断取得这个斗争的胜利的。我们的党和人民政府在领导人民群众建设和扩大社会主义经济的同时，曾经不断地对人民群众进行爱护和保卫公共财产的教育，使广大人民群众逐步树立了对于公共财产的新观念和新态度。有许多国家工作人员和职工群众，不仅在使用公共财物时非常珍惜，对生产设备非常爱护，在使用原材料时尽量节省；并且曾经为了保卫公共财产而顽强地和各种损害公共财产的犯罪行为以及各种自然灾害作斗争。有的人为了检举贪污盗窃和浪费行为，虽然遭受到坏分子的打击，但他们终于经过不屈不挠的斗争而取得胜利；有的人为了护厂捉特务而被敌人打死打伤；有的人在危急情况下奋勇抢救公共财物而身受重伤以至残废。只要我们进一步发扬广大人民的积极性，人人积极参加生产建设，人人爱护和保卫公共财产，我们就一定能够消除一切破坏、损害、盗窃和浪费公共财产的现象！
