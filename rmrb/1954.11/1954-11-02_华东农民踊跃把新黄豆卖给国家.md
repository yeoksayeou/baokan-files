    East China Peasants Enthusiastically Sell New Soybeans to the State
    Peasants in various parts of East China are enthusiastically selling new soybeans, and the amount of soybeans purchased by grain departments and supply and marketing cooperatives is constantly increasing. This year's soybean harvest in East China is good. After the harvest, farmers actively sell their newly harvested soybeans to the state. According to statistics from the East China Grain Department, the amount of soybeans purchased in the entire region increased by 110.78 percent in mid-October compared to early October. In the first and middle ten days of October this year, the amount of soybeans purchased by the state increased by 270.39 percent compared to the same period last year. Currently, Jiangsu Province alone purchases approximately five million catties of soybeans daily. As of October 21, Fujian Province had completed 172.73 percent of its soybean purchase target for the month.
    Some areas carried out pre-purchase work before the soybeans matured. Among the various autumn grains pre-purchased in Shandong Province, soybeans accounted for 66.5 percent. Currently, farmers in Shandong and other places are actively delivering soybeans in accordance with pre-purchase contracts. (Cheng Hua)

    华东农民踊跃把新黄豆卖给国家
    华东各地农民踊跃出售新黄豆，粮食部门和供销合作社收购黄豆数量正在不断增加。今年华东区黄豆收成良好。收割以后，农民们都积极把新收黄豆卖给国家。据华东粮食部门统计，全区收购黄豆的数量十月中旬比上旬增加百分之一百一十点七八。今年十月上、中两旬，国家收购黄豆的数量，比去年同期增加了百分之二百七十点三九。目前，仅江苏一省每天收购黄豆的数量即在五百万斤左右。福建省到十月二十一日止，已经完成当月收购黄豆任务百分之一百七十二点七三。
    有些地区在黄豆成熟以前进行了预购工作。山东省预购的各种秋粮中，黄豆占百分之六十六点五。现在，山东等地农民正积极按照预购合同交售黄豆。　（程华）
