The "Pravda" published an editorial on the 13th entitled "Economic Cooperation and Mutual Assistance Among Free Nations." The editorial pointed out that the friendly cooperation among the people of the great socialist camp is constantly strengthening in the process of economic and cultural development.

Life eloquently proves that friendly cooperation and mutual assistance among free nations are the most important source of strength for all countries united under the lofty goal of building socialism. Fraternal friendship, mutual assistance, and cooperation are becoming stronger day by day, and the relations between the People's Democracies and the Soviet Union, as well as among themselves, are constantly developing.

"Pravda" emphasized that the economic relationship between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China is the best example of such effective cooperation. These relationships—a manifestation of the unbreakable friendship between these two great nations—actively consolidate the cause of peace, democracy, and socialism.

Another significant contribution to the economic and cultural relations between the Chinese and Soviet peoples is the recent signing in Beijing of several agreements, namely the agreement on the Soviet government granting the government of the People's Republic of China a long-term credit loan of 520 million rubles; the agreement on Soviet assistance to China in constructing 15 new enterprises and increasing the supply of equipment to the 141 enterprises previously agreed upon. The total value of equipment the Soviet Union has increased its supply to China will exceed 400 million rubles.

Speaking of the expansion of trade among the countries of the socialist camp, "Pravda" continued: The new world market composed of the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies knows no difficulty in sales, and its capacity grows with the development of the socialist economies of these countries.

Last year, the total foreign trade volume of all democratic countries exceeded the 1948 level by 2.3 times. Effective cooperation in the democratic world market has helped the People's Democracies implement their plans for laying the foundations of socialism and improving the living standards of the people.

"Pravda" pointed out that last year, the Soviet Union exported machinery and equipment worth 800 million rubles to the People's Democracies. On the Soviet side, it obtained various goods from the People's Democracies that are of great significance for its economic development and improving the living standards of the people.

"Pravda" continued, the economic cooperation among free nations unearths new, far from utilized potentials, enabling the countries of the socialist camp to use their equipment, raw materials, and food resources most rationally in order to ensure faster development of productive forces. The Soviet Union and the People's Democracies are tirelessly striving to develop and improve the methods and means of economic cooperation.

In this regard, "Pravda" recalled that the Soviet government has transferred its shares in the Soviet-Romanian, Soviet-Chinese, Soviet-Bulgarian, and Soviet-Hungarian joint-stock companies.

"Pravda" emphasized that the Soviet government's decision to hand over its shares in joint-stock companies is aimed at strengthening the friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies. This cooperation embodies the new type of international relations established between the countries of the socialist camp. The vigorous vitality of these relations lies in the fact that they are based on the genuine and complete equality of all countries—large and small, on mutual trust and friendship between countries, on safeguarding national independence and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, and on common efforts to ensure world peace.

"Pravda" pointed out that the close economic ties between the countries of the socialist camp do not mean that these countries will hinder the development of trade relations with capitalist countries on the basis of complete equality, mutual respect, and mutual benefit. The Soviet Union and other People's Democracies believe that such trade is not only important for the economic development of each other but also for establishing friendly relations among all countries and strengthening world peace.

The example of the fraternal cooperation of free nations vividly proves to the people under the oppression of imperialist countries that in addition to the relationship of domination and enslavement, there are and can be other relationships between countries.

"Pravda" concluded: The working people of the countries of the socialist camp protect their mutual friendly relations like the apple of their eye, and they tirelessly dedicate themselves to consolidating and developing mutual cooperation. The fraternal friendship and cooperation consistently established between the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies demonstrate that the cause of peace, democracy, and socialism is invincible.

    自由的各民族的经济合作和互助
    ——苏联“真理报”十一月十三日的社论摘要
    真理报于十三日发表了题为“自由的各民族的经济合作和互助”的社论。社论指出，伟大的社会主义阵营各国人民之间的友好合作，在经济和文化发展进程中不断地增强起来。
    生活雄辩地证明了，自由的各民族之间的友好与互助，是团结在建设社会主义的崇高目标下的各国底力量的最主要源泉。兄弟般的友好互助和合作一天比一天巩固，各人民民主国家同苏联以及它们之间的关系正在不断发展。
    真理报强调说，苏联同中华人民共和国之间的经济关系就是这种有效的合作的最好的典范。这些关系——这两个伟大民族的牢不可破的友谊关系的表现，积极地巩固着和平、民主和社会主义的事业。
    对中、苏两国人民的经济和文化关系的另一重大贡献，是最近在北京签订的一些协定，即关于苏联政府给予中华人民共和国政府五亿二千万卢布长期信用贷款的协定；关于苏联援助中国修建十五项新企业和增加对以前签订的一百四十一项企业的设备的供应的协定。苏联所增加供应给中国的设备的总值将在四亿卢布以上。
    在谈到社会主义阵营国家之间的贸易扩展时，真理报接着说：由苏联和人民民主国家组成的新的世界市场，不知道有销售的困难，它的容纳量随着这些国家的社会主义经济的发展而增长。
    去年一年，所有民主国家的对外贸易总量超过一九四八年的水平二点三倍。民主的世界市场上的有效合作，帮助了各人民民主国家推行其奠定社会主义基础和提高人民的生活水平的计划。
    真理报指出，去年苏联向各人民民主国家输出了价值八亿卢布的机器和设备。在苏联方面，从各人民民主国家获得了各种对它的经济发展和提高人民的生活水平有重要意义的货物。
    真理报继续说，自由的各民族的经济合作，发掘出新的远未利用上的潜能，使得社会主义阵营各国能够为了保证更快地发展生产力而最合理地使用其设备、原料和粮食资源。苏联和各人民民主国家不倦地力求发展和改善经济合作的方式和方法。
    就此，真理报追溯，苏联政府已移交出它在苏罗、苏中、苏保和苏匈股份公司中的股份。
    真理报强调说，苏联政府的交出它在股份公司中的股份的决定，旨在加强苏联同各人民民主国家的友好和合作。这种合作体现出社会主义阵营国家之间所建立起来的新型的国际关系。这些关系的旺盛生命力在于它们是基于一切国家——大国和小国的真正完全的平等，是基于各国之间的相互信任和友好，基于维护民族独立和不干涉他国内政，基于对保证世界和平的共同努力。
    真理报指出，社会主义阵营国家之间的紧密的经济联系，毫不意味着会妨碍这些国家同资本主义国家之间在双方完全平等、互相尊重和互利的基础上发展贸易关系。苏联和其他人民民主国家认为：这种贸易不只对彼此的经济发展是重要的，而且对在所有国家之间建立友好关系、加强世界和平也是重要的。
    自由的各民族的兄弟般的合作的范例，向处在帝国主义国家压迫下的人民生动地证明了：在国家和国家之间，除了统治和奴役的关系之外，还有而且能够有其它的关系。
    真理报最后说：社会主义阵营各国的劳动人民保护他们的相互友好关系，像保护他们的眼睛一样，他们不倦地致力于巩固和发展相互的合作。苏联和各人民民主国家之间所一贯建立起来的兄弟般的友好和合作，表明了和平、民主和社会主义事业是不可战胜的。
