    Xiamen Housewife Chen Lihua Exposes Special Agents
    In the summer of 1953, one day a secret letter written on white paper with red grid lines was placed on the desk of the director of the Xiamen Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau. The director nodded and smiled, saying, "The masses are also watching these two fellows. Chiang Kai-shek's special agents cannot escape the giant palm of the people." He picked up the secret letter and read it from beginning to end. The letter stated:
    "Wang Qiongyao served as the factory director of the Houjiangdai Match Factory during the Kuomintang reactionary rule. He fled to Hong Kong before the liberation of Xiamen and has no legitimate occupation. He returned from Hong Kong around March this year and moved to live here in April. This person has an unclear history, and his words and deeds since coming to Xiamen are contrary to the people. Recently, a woman claiming to be his cousin named Xue Shuzhen also came to Xiamen from Hong Kong. Their actions are very suspicious. They have no jobs in Hong Kong, and they have no work to do after returning to Xiamen, but they are very financially well-off; and they leave early and return late every day, acting furtively."
    This letter was written by a housewife named Chen Lihua.
    A few days later, Chen Lihua met with public security personnel. She described Wang Qiongyao and Xue Shuzhen's activities in detail.
    Wang Qiongyao returned from Hong Kong in 1953 and moved into the room opposite Chen Lihua's. As time went on, Chen Lihua noticed that there were many suspicious things in this person's daily life: Wang returned from Hong Kong and had nothing to do, so why did he go out early and return late every day? Wang had no legitimate income, so where did the money come from to go to restaurants to eat fish and meat every day? Not long after, Xue Shuzhen also came to Xiamen, claiming to be Wang's cousin, but why were they sleeping in the same room? This series of questions made Chen Lihua vigilant. She thought: These things must be clarified, and if he is a bad person, he must be reported to the public security organs. But how can I know if Wang is a bad person? So, whenever she had time, she would talk to Wang Qiongyao's wife, who was originally in Xiamen, about household matters. One day, she asked Wang's wife, "Wang Qiongyao and Xue Shuzhen have a very good relationship, cousins are very nice."
    "Nonsense! Who knows when he hooked up with this improper woman in Hong Kong," Wang's wife said with a grievance.
    Chen Lihua asked Wang's wife again:
    "It's great that you have a younger uncle who often sends you money."
    Wang's wife said, "Wang Qiongyao has a younger brother in the Philippines, but he was given to someone else as a son when he was a child, and we haven't been in contact for a long time. He never sent a penny in the past. I don't know where he got rich now, but he sends money every two months."
    Chen Lihua became even more suspicious. Wang Qiongyao and his wife have been married for eight or nine years and have two children, but they have never seen his brother send a penny. Why did he start sending money after Wang Qiongyao returned from Hong Kong? One morning, Chen Lihua was breastfeeding her child when the postman knocked on the door, saying that money had been sent from Hong Kong to Wang Qiongyao. Coincidentally, Wang Qiongyao and the others were not at home. Chen Lihua cleverly glanced at the money order and secretly noted the name and address of the remitter. Later, she asked Wang's wife: What is your husband's brother's name? The name and address given in response did not match what was written on the money order. Chen Lihua was certain that there must be a problem.
    After Chen Lihua spoke with the public security personnel, she realized that her responsibility was very important, and she went home to continue monitoring Wang Qiongyao and Xue Shuzhen's actions. She is a housewife in her twenties with a husband and three children. She is busy with housework every day, but she always treats this matter as her own. Every day, as soon as she opened her eyes, she paid attention to Wang Qiongyao's movements in the opposite room. She kept a record of when he went out, when he came back, and what he usually said. One day at noon, she saw Wang Qiongyao and Xue Shuzhen go out. She was about to lie down for a nap, but after a while, Wang Qiongyao came back. She heard the sound of the door closing. She thought: This fellow just went out and hurriedly came back, there must be something fishy going on. She deliberately walked past the window and saw Wang Qiongyao squatting in front of the bed writing something. Chen Lihua thought to herself: Why isn't he writing at the table in front of the window? Why is he so flustered?
    Although the special agents Wang Qiongyao and Xue Shuzhen were very cunning, they could not deceive the eyes and ears of the people. They were afraid that people would suspect that they had no jobs but were living so well, so they set up a writing stall at the intersection of Kaiyuan Road to cover up their counter-revolutionary activities; at home, they began to pretend to be poor in terms of food and clothing, telling everyone that they had run out of savings and had pawned their watches, pens, and clothes. But this also could not deceive Chen Lihua, and she paid even closer attention to Wang Qiongyao's activities.
    Once, Chen Lihua discovered a suspicious person coming to see Wang Qiongyao, and she immediately reported the situation to the public security organs. Another time, it was raining heavily, and there was an emergency situation to report. There was no one to take care of the three children, and she didn't have an umbrella, so she first sent the two older children to her mother's house and braved the rain to take her two-year-old daughter to the public security organs. She said: No matter how difficult it is to monitor counter-revolutionary elements, I am not afraid. Chen Lihua gloriously fulfilled the responsibility that a citizen should fulfill in order to expose special agents.
    After a long period of investigation by the public security organs, it was confirmed that Wang Qiongyao was a special agent sent by the "Hong Kong South China Office of the Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Interior" of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique's special agent organization. Xue Shuzhen was not Wang Qiongyao's cousin, but his mistress in Hong Kong, a female special agent. After they came to Xiamen, they collected our military, political, and economic intelligence, and secretly wrote twelve intelligence reports to the special agent organization in Hong Kong, and developed a counter-revolutionary organization.
    The two criminals, Wang Qiongyao and Xue Shuzhen, were arrested by our public security personnel. They were subjected to the just sanction of the people. On November 4th, they were publicly tried in Xiamen. The Fujian Provincial People's Court sentenced Wang Qiongyao to death and executed him immediately; Xue Shuzhen was sentenced to fifteen years in prison.

### 厦门市家庭妇女陈丽华检举特务

    厦门市家庭妇女陈丽华检举特务
    在一九五三年的夏天，有一天一封用白纸红格信笺写的密告信，摆在厦门市人民政府公安局局长办公室的桌子上，局长点头笑了笑说：“这两个家伙群众也在注意了，蒋贼特务是逃不脱人民的巨掌的。”他拿起密告信从头到尾看了一遍，信上写道：
    “王琼瑶在国民党反动统治时做过后江埭火柴厂厂长。厦门解放前逃往香港，没有正当职业。今年三月间由香港回来，四月间搬到我们这里居住。这个人历史不清，来厦后的言谈及一切举动与人民相反。最近，有一个自称是他的表妹名叫薛淑珍的女人，也由香港来厦。他们两人行迹很可疑，在香港都没职业，回厦后也没工作干，但经济十分宽裕；而且天天早出晚归，行动鬼鬼祟祟的。”
    这封信是一位家庭妇女陈丽华写的。
    几天以后，陈丽华见到了公安人员，她详细地叙述了王琼瑶、薛淑珍的活动。
    王琼瑶在一九五三年从香港回来，搬到陈丽华对面的房间住下。日子久了，陈丽华就看出了这个人日常生活有许多地方值得怀疑：王由香港回来没事干，为什么天天早出晚归？王没有正当收入，天天上酒馆吃鱼吃肉，钱从哪里来？过了不久，薛淑珍也到了厦门，自称是王的表妹，但他们为什么又在一个房间睡觉？这一连串疑问使得陈丽华警惕起来。她想：这些事一定要弄清楚，如果他是坏人，就要报告公安机关。但怎样知道王是不是坏人呢？于是，她有空就找王琼瑶原在厦门的妻子谈家常。有一天，她问王的妻子：“王琼瑶、薛淑珍的感情很好，表兄表妹都不错。”
    “见鬼！谁知道他在香港什么时候搭上这个不三不四的坏女人。”王的妻子说这句话时带着一股怨气。
    陈丽华又问王的妻子：
    “你有一个小叔真好，经常寄钱给你们。”
    王的妻子说：“王琼瑶有一个弟弟在菲律宾，但那是在小时候就送给人家做儿子了，很久都没联系过，过去从来没有寄一块钱，现在不知发了什么洋财，两个月就寄一次钱来。”
    陈丽华更怀疑了。王琼瑶和他妻子结婚八、九年，孩子都生了两个，从未看见他弟弟寄一个钱来。为什么王琼瑶从香港回来，他就寄钱来呢？一天上午，陈丽华正在给孩子喂奶，邮递员来打门，说香港寄钱给王琼瑶，恰巧王琼瑶他们都不在家，陈丽华机警地看了一下汇票，暗中记下了汇款人的名字和住址。以后，她就向王的妻子了解：你丈夫的弟弟名叫什么？回答的名字和住址和汇票写的都不对头。陈丽华就肯定了这其中一定有问题。
    陈丽华和公安人员谈话后，她认识到自己的责任很重大，回家继续监视王琼瑶、薛淑珍的行动。她是一个二十多岁的家庭妇女，有丈夫和三个孩子。每天要忙着料理家务，可是这件事她总当作自己的事去做。每天，一睁开眼，她就注意对面房间王琼瑶的动静。他什么时候出去，什么时候回来，平时说些什么话，都一一记在心里。有一天中午，她看见王琼瑶和薛淑珍都出门去了，她正想躺下睡觉，可是一会儿王琼瑶又回来了，她听见关房门的声音。她想：这家伙刚出去又匆匆忙忙回来，一定又有鬼花样，故意从窗口走过，一眼看去，见王琼瑶正蹲在床前写什么，陈丽华暗自思量：为什么不在窗前的桌子上写？为什么这样慌慌张张？
    特务王琼瑶、薛淑珍虽十分狡猾，但也瞒骗不了人民的耳目。他们怕人怀疑自己没有职业，生活还过得这么好，就在开元路口摆了一个代书摊，以掩护他们的反革命活动；在家里的吃穿开始装穷了，逢人就说过去积的钱用完了，手表、钢笔、衣服也典当光了。这也骗不过陈丽华，她更加严密注意王琼瑶的活动。
    有一次，陈丽华发现一个形迹可疑的人来找王琼瑶，她立刻去公安机关报告情况。又有一次，天正下着大雨，有一个紧急的情况要去报告，三个孩子都没人照顾，又没雨伞，她就先把两个较大的孩子寄在她母亲家里，自己冒雨抱了二岁的女儿到公安机关。她说：监视反革命分子，再困难，我也不怕。陈丽华为了检举特务，她光荣地尽到了一个公民应尽的责任。
    经过公安机关长时间的侦察，证实了王琼瑶是蒋介石卖国集团特务机关“内政部调查局香港华南办事处”派来的特务，薛淑珍并不是王琼瑶的表妹，而是他在香港的姘头，是个女特务。他们来厦门后，已收集我军事、政治、经济情报，先后密写情报十二份寄给设在香港的特务机关，并发展了反革命组织。
    王琼瑶、薛淑珍二犯被我公安人员逮捕了。他们受到了人民正义的制裁。十一月四日在厦门公审，福建省人民法院判王琼瑶死刑，立即执行；薛淑珍被判处有期徒刑十五年。
