Farmers in various parts of Hubei Province have repaid 51.5 billion yuan in overdue agricultural loans in the two months of September and October. Farmers in various places deeply appreciate the benefits of national loans for developing agricultural production. Therefore, after selling surplus grain, cotton, and other agricultural products, they have enthusiastically repaid overdue loans. The Rao Xingli Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xishui County had only two head of cattle and very incomplete farm tools when it was first established in 1952. Through the state bank's continuous issuance of 34.15 million yuan in loans, plus its own funds, it has added 18 head of cattle, 17 plows, 3 waterwheels, 20 sprayers, and more than 100 other farm tools over the years. Based on being organized, this agricultural production cooperative has received such strong support from the state bank and has achieved bumper harvests year after year. Recently, after selling 80,000 jin of surplus grain and more than 5,800 jin of cotton to the state, this agricultural production cooperative decided to repay 20 million yuan in loans; members also decided to repay 5 million yuan in personal loans. Jiang Yingming, a farmer from Jiaoshan Township, Second District, Zhongxiang County, borrowed 600,000 yuan in loans. He said, "We have a bumper harvest here this year, and I want to repay the loans in time so that the government can use them to help the disaster-stricken farmers." The farmers in this township have already repaid more than 32 million yuan in loans. (Correspondent Group of the Hubei Provincial Branch of the People's Bank of China)

    湖北省各地农民
    积极归还到期的农业贷款
    湖北省各地农民在九月和十月两个月中，已经归还到期农业贷款五百一十五亿元。各地农民深切体会到国家贷款对发展农业生产的好处，因此在卖出余粮、棉花等农产品以后，都踊跃归还到期贷款。浠水县饶兴礼农业生产合作社在一九五二年刚成立的时候，只有两头耕牛，农具很不齐全；经过国家银行连年发放给三千四百一十五万元贷款，加上自有的资金，几年来共添置耕牛十八头、犁十七具、水车三乘、喷雾器二十个，及其他的农具一百多件。这个农业生产合作社在组织起来的基础上，由于得到国家银行这样大力的扶植，连年获得丰收。最近这个农业生产合作社把八万斤余粮、五千八百多斤棉花卖给国家以后，决定要还清二千万元贷款；社员个人借的贷款也要归还五百万元。钟祥县第二区焦山乡农民姜应明借着六十万元贷款，他说：“今年我们这里丰收，我要及时还清贷款，好让政府拿去帮助受灾的农民。”这个乡的农民已经归还贷款三千二百多万元。  （中国人民银行湖北省分行通讯组）
