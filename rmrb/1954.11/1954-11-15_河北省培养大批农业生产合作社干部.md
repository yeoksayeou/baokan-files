    Hebei Province Trains a Large Number of Agricultural Producers' Cooperative Cadres
    In the development of the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement, Hebei Province has trained a large number of cooperative management cadres, improving the ability of rural work cadres to lead the mutual aid and cooperation movement.
    Before last autumn's trial period, Hebei Province had more than 3,600 agricultural producers' cooperatives. These cooperatives were established under the leadership of Party committees at all levels and directly managed by specially assigned full-time cadres. Last winter and this spring, the number of agricultural producers' cooperatives in the province developed to more than 31,000. The development and consolidation of these cooperatives improved the work ability of cadres. At present, not only do the vast majority of county and district cadres have a certain amount of leadership experience and cooperative management knowledge, but most township cadres have also initially learned how to manage cooperatives. According to estimates from the Shijiazhuang, Xingtai, and other special districts, in Raoyang, Xingtai, Shahe and other counties where the cooperative movement is better, the vast majority of county, district, and township cadres can lead cooperatives; in average counties, about one-half can; and in relatively backward counties, about one-third of the cadres have generally learned how to manage cooperatives.
    In order to train cadres and improve leadership levels, Party committees at all levels in the Hebei Province have established their own key cooperatives, drawing experience from in-depth assistance to the work of these key cooperatives. The seven key cooperatives directly linked by the Provincial Party Committee in plains, mountainous areas, and various different crop areas have played an important role in the Provincial Party Committee's leadership of general cooperatives over the past year. Local party committees and county party committees have also enriched their leadership experience by relying on key cooperatives for learning and research.
    In order to improve cadres, Party committees at all levels have systematically adopted methods such as holding training classes and utilizing meetings for inspecting and summarizing the work of cooperatives, as well as mutual aid and cooperation representative meetings and guiding cadres in self-study, to universally train cadres. Last winter and this spring, approximately hundreds of thousands of rural cadres at the township level and above throughout the province received training. Before this autumn, the province's first batch of more than 80,000 construction core members of cooperatives had already completed training, and the second batch of construction core members training is underway. In practical work, various localities have also adopted methods such as experienced people mentoring new people, learning from old cooperatives, and learning through mutual aid and cooperation networks and stations. According to statistics from six special districts and eighty-four counties alone, there are more than 2,600 organizations such as mutual aid and cooperation networks, joint cooperative committees, and learning stations for exchanging cooperative management experience and improving production technology. Many cadres have not only increased their experience from practice but have also further raised their awareness. Many district and township cadres said, "With cooperatives, not only can production be increased, but all work becomes easier to handle." In order to adapt to the needs of future large-scale development, Party organizations at all levels in Hebei Province are continuing to work hard to improve the cooperative management ability of all rural work cadres in the mass cooperative management movement.

    河北省培养大批农业生产合作社干部
    河北省在农业互助合作运动的发展中，锻炼出大批的办社干部，提高了农村工作干部领导互助合作运动的水平。
    在去秋以前的试办时期，河北省共有三千六百多个农业生产合作社，这些合作社是在各级党委的领导下，由专设的专职干部直接掌握举办的。去冬今春全省农业生产合作社发展到三万一千多个，这些社的发展和巩固，提高了干部的工作能力。目前不仅绝大多数的县、区干部有了一定的领导经验和办社知识，而且多数乡干部也初步学会了办社。据石家庄、邢台等专区估计，在合作化运动较好的饶阳、邢台、沙河等县，绝大多数县区乡干部都会领导社，一般的县约有二分之一，比较落后的县份也约有三分之一的干部大体学会办社。
    为了锻炼干部、提高领导水平，中共河北省各级党委都建立了自己的重点社，从深入帮助重点社的工作中吸取经验。省委在平原、山地和各种不同作物区直接联系的七个重点社，一年来对于省委领导一般社的工作上，起了重要作用。各地委和县委也由于依靠重点进行学习和研究，丰富了自己的领导经验。
    为了提高干部，各级党委均有计划地采用了召开训练班和利用检查、总结合作社工作的会议，以及互助合作代表会议和指导干部自学等方法，普遍训练了干部。去冬今春，全省乡以上的农村干部约有几十万人受到了训练。今年秋前，全省第一批八万余名建社骨干的训练早已完成，第二批的建社骨干训练正在进行中。各地在实际工作中，还采用了熟手带生手、向老社学习、通过互助合作网、站进行学习。仅据六个专区，八十四个县的统计，就有互助合作网、联社委员会和学习站等交流办社经验及提高生产技术的组织二千六百多个。很多干部从实践中不仅增长了经验，又进一步提高了觉悟，很多区、乡干部说：“有了合作社不仅能够增产，什么工作都好办了”。为了适应今后大发展的需要，河北省各级党的组织正在领导群众办社运动中继续努力提高全体农村工作干部的办社能力。
