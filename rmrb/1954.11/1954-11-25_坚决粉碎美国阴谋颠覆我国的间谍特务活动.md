　　On November 29, 1952, and January 12, 1953, respectively, an air defense unit and a public security unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Northeast China shot down two American spy planes that had secretly entered our country's airspace. Furthermore, from 1951 to 1954, public security organs and public security forces in our country successively captured a group of American spies and special agents who had infiltrated our country from the air. According to the results of the interrogations, this group of American spies and special agents were guilty of serious crimes of plotting terrorist and sabotage activities within our country, endangering our country's security and peaceful construction. The Chinese people believe that these American spies and special agents must be strictly dealt with. Recently, the Military Tribunal of the Supreme People's Court held trials for the cases of American spy Arnold and others, and the cases of American spies Downey, Fecteau, and others, and handed down deserved legal sanctions to the American spies and special agents in these two cases. This is entirely necessary and correct and will surely be supported by the people of our country and peace-loving people of the world.

　　American spy Arnold and 13 others secretly entered our country's Northeast airspace on January 12, 1953, aboard an aircraft to carry out espionage and reconnaissance activities to gather intelligence about our country's defense facilities. American spies Downey and Fecteau, dispatched by the American Central Intelligence Agency's Atsugi spy agency in Japan, secretly entered our country's Northeast airspace on November 29, 1952, aboard an aircraft to contact and supply special agents who had landed in our country, and attempted to retrieve a special agent, Li Junying, who had been airdropped, from the air. Then, based on the intelligence he had collected, they planned to airdrop a large number of special agents into our country. Prior to this, Downey and Fecteau had directed the airdropping of 11 special agents, including Zhang Zaiwen, into Northeast China, ordering them to establish "airdrop sites" and "safe houses" to hide spies and special agents, gather important intelligence about our country's defense facilities and economic construction, and recruit remnant counter-revolutionaries to conspire to organize armed rebellion. However, under the close surveillance of our powerful and vigilant People's Liberation Army and public security organs, and with the active assistance of the broad masses of the local people, the enemy's sinister plots were not successful. Two American aircraft specifically used for espionage and special agent activities were shot down by us, and this group of criminal American spies and special agents were all captured by us, or were killed on the spot.

　　The American aggressive bloc's criminal activity of airdropping special agents into our country for its aggressive purposes began long ago. As early as the initial period of our country's liberation, the American aggressors colluded with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to establish many espionage training and dispatch organizations, including the so-called "Sino-American Joint Office" and the "Mainland Work Office of the Ministry of National Defense." One of the major conspiracies of these spy organizations was, under the control of American spy agencies, to recruit various counter-revolutionaries, train them, and then airdrop them into our country by plane. In July 1951, the American "Chase Advisory Group" stationed in Taiwan also helped the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique establish the "Airdrop Liaison Team of the Guerrilla Cadre Training Class of the Ministry of National Defense" in Tamsui, Taiwan, specializing in training airdropped special agents, further intensifying the activities of airdropping special agents. The American Central Intelligence Agency, the largest spy agency, also established special agencies in South Korea and Japan to airdrop special agents into our country. The so-called "Headquarters of the Free China Movement," presided over by the notorious former Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique's special agent head, Cai Wenzhi, was a spy organization directly controlled by the American Central Intelligence Agency. In recent years, many of the airdropped special agents captured in our country were dispatched by this spy organization. However, this large group of airdropped special agents have been successively captured within our country. This is a heavy blow to the American aggressive bloc's conspiracy.

　　The confessions of the captured American spies and special agents and various pieces of evidence thoroughly expose the criminal conspiracy of the American aggressive bloc to be hostile to the people of our country. The American aggressors have shamelessly slandered our country as carrying out so-called "subversive activities" in other countries, but the confessions of these two groups of American spies and special agents and various pieces of evidence once again prove that it is not us who are carrying out subversive activities against other countries, but the American reactionary ruling bloc. Arnold, Downey, Fecteau, and the other 22 American spies and special agents were all dispatched by the American Central Intelligence Agency via Tokyo and other places. Zhang Zaiwen and the other nine special agents airdropped into Northeast China by Downey have also confessed that they were specially trained by American Central Intelligence Agency spy training institutions located in Saipan and other places. Their main purpose in parachuting into our country was to establish "bases" for armed special agents, hide "safe houses" and "airdrop sites" for special agents, and establish transportation lines from the "bases" to Shenyang, to reconnoiter China's defense facilities and the targets of industrial areas, to collect meteorological intelligence, and to recruit and organize the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to prepare for organizing armed rebellion. Before they were sent out, an American spy boss had arrogantly told them that he would enter China with the American army during the war. This spy boss even called them "paving the way for the war." The so-called "581st Air Supply and Communications Liaison Team" commanded by Arnold also served the American Central Intelligence Agency. The task of this team was, according to the instructions of the American "Central Intelligence Agency," to airdrop spies into China, the Soviet Union, and the People's Democratic countries, to airdrop supplies to ground spies and special agents, to maintain communication with them, and to retrieve them from the air when necessary. This team also sent a "Vidi" crew attached to the "91st Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron" under the U.S. Far East Air Force Bomber Command, and this squadron targeted China and the Soviet Union for strategic reconnaissance. Are not all these facts ironclad evidence that the American aggressive bloc is attempting to launch a new war of aggression against our country and attempting to subvert our people's regime from within! The American aggressive bloc cannot deny it.

　　As everyone knows, the American aggressive bloc has consistently sent spies into the Soviet Union and various People's Democratic countries, plotting various sabotage activities. As early as 1951, former U.S. President Truman approved the so-called "Mutual Security Act," with the U.S. government openly appropriating $100 million as expenses for organizing and instigating sabotage and subversive activities in these countries' territories. The foreign aid bills for 1954 and 1955 passed by the U.S. Congress recently also contain a special appropriation for spying and sabotage activities. The U.S. government has successively established many huge spy agencies, attempting to form a ring of espionage and special agent activities against the Soviet Union and various People's Democratic countries. However, the enemy's plans have been met with shameful failures everywhere. In recent years, various countries in the peace and democracy camp have successively cracked many cases of American spies carrying out sabotage and subversive activities. In recent years, our country has also successively cracked a number of spy and special agent cases, which fully demonstrates the consolidation and strength of socialist forces and the people's democratic regime. However, we must not ignore this kind of spying and sabotage activity by the American aggressors. In future struggles, we must work harder to crush the restoration conspiracies of domestic and foreign counter-revolutionaries, and we should never relax our vigilance at any time.

　　Comrade Liu Shaoqi instructed us in the "Report on the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China": "At present, American imperialism is still occupying Taiwan, and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is still entrenched in Taiwan, continuing to do evil, and is constantly attempting to return to the mainland. The restoration of the reactionaries is still a practical danger. If anyone belittles this danger, they will make mistakes." Therefore, we must constantly strengthen our preparedness and resolutely crush all sabotage activities of spies and special agents.

　　In order to achieve victory in this struggle, we must not only further strengthen the people's public security organs and judicial organs, but also extensively and deeply carry out mass anti-espionage and anti-special agent work, and fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses of the people in the struggle against the enemy. Especially in combating the enemy's airdropped special agent activities, this kind of mass anti-espionage and anti-special agent work is particularly important. We believe that as long as the public security organs at all levels and the public security forces of the People's Liberation Army maintain a high degree of revolutionary vigilance and are good at relying on the masses and earnestly doing a good job in mass public security and defense work, and further strengthen and improve the militia organization, then all the spies and special agents sent by the enemy, no matter whether they come from land, sea, or air, will not be able to escape the grasp of the people of our country. The people of our country will never allow American spies and special agents to escape the net. The people of our country will certainly be able to crush all the American aggressive bloc's conspiracies to subvert our people's regime.

    坚决粉碎美国阴谋颠覆我国的间谍特务活动
    一九五二年十一月二十九日和一九五三年一月十二日我驻守东北地区的人民解放军某防空部队和人民公安部队曾先后击落了两架偷入我国领空的美国特务飞机，并且在自一九五一年到一九五四年的期间我国人民公安机关和公安部队陆续捕获了一批从空中潜入我国的美国间谍特务分子。从侦讯的结果看，这一批美国间谍特务分子犯有阴谋在我国境内进行恐怖破坏活动、危害我国安全和和平建设事业的重大罪行。中国人民认为对于这些美国间谍特务分子必须予以严格处理。最近最高人民法院军事审判庭开庭审理了美国间谍阿诺德等人的案件和美国间谍唐奈、费克图等人的案件，判决给予这两个案件中的美国间谍特务以应得的法律制裁，这是完全必要的和正确的，必然会得到我国人民和世界爱好和平的人民的一致拥护。
    美国间谍阿诺德等十四人，在一九五三年一月十二日乘坐飞机偷入我国东北领空，进行刺探我国国防设施的间谍侦察活动。美国间谍唐奈和费克图受美国中央情报局驻日本厚木间谍机关的派遣，在一九五二年十一月二十九日乘坐飞机偷入我国东北领空，联络和接济降落在我国境内的特务分子，并企图将一名已空投下来的特务分子李军英从空中取走，然后根据他所搜集的情报，再空投大量的特务分子到我国境内。在这以前，唐奈和费克图曾主持将特务分子张载文等十一名空投到我国东北境内，要他们建立“空投场”和掩蔽间谍特务分子的“安全处所”，刺探我国国防设施和经济建设等重要情报，并收罗残余的反革命分子，阴谋组织武装暴乱。但是在我强大机警的人民解放军和人民公安机关的严密监视之下，在当地广大人民的积极协助之下，敌人的这些罪恶阴谋并未得逞，两架专供间谍特务活动使用的美国飞机被我击落了，这一批罪恶的美国间谍特务分子全部已被我捕获，或已被当场击毙。
    美国侵略集团为了它的侵略目的，在我国境内空投特务的罪恶活动是早就开始了的。早在我国大陆解放的初期，美国侵略者就勾结蒋介石卖国集团，成立了许多间谍的训练和派遣机构，其中有所谓“中美联合办公处”和“国防部大陆工作处”。这些间谍组织的重大阴谋之一，就是在美国间谍机关的掌握下，网罗各种反革命分子，对他们施以训练，然后用飞机把他们空投到我国境内。一九五一年七月，美国驻台湾的“蔡斯顾问团”，又帮助蒋介石卖国集团在台湾的淡水设立了“国防部游击干部训练班空投联络队”，专门训练空投特务分子，进一步加紧了空投特务分子的活动。美国最大的间谍机关中央情报局，也在南朝鲜和日本等地设立了向我国空投特务的专门机构。由恶名昭著的前蒋介石卖国集团特务头子蔡文治主持的所谓“自由中国运动总部”，就是由美国中央情报局直接掌握的一个间谍组织。最近几年来，我国所捕获的空投特务分子，有很多都是这个间谍组织派遣来的。但是，这一大批空投的特务分子，在我国境内都被陆续捕获了。这对于美国侵略集团的阴谋是一个沉重的打击。
    落网的美国间谍特务的供词和各种证据，彻底揭露了美国侵略集团敌视我国人民的罪恶阴谋。美国侵略者曾经厚颜无耻地污蔑我国在别的国家里进行所谓“颠覆活动”，但是这两批美国间谍特务的供词和各种证据再一次证明：对别的国家进行颠覆活动的不是我们，而是美国反动统治集团。阿诺德、唐奈和费克图等二十二名美国间谍特务，都是美国中央情报局经由东京等地派遣来的。由唐奈空投到我国东北境内的特务张载文等九人，也都供认他们是经过美国中央情报局设在塞班岛等地的间谍训练机构专门训练过的，他们空降到我国境内的主要目的，是要建立武装特务的“根据地”，掩蔽特务的“安全处所”、“空投场”和从“根据地”到沈阳的交通线，侦察中国国防设备和工业地区的目标，搜集气象情报以及搜罗和组织蒋介石卖国集团的残余人员准备组织武装暴乱。在他们被派出之前，美国一个间谍头子曾经狂妄地对他们说过，他将在大战中随美国军队进入中国。这个间谍头子并且把他们称作“大战的铺路者”。阿诺德所指挥的所谓“五八一空中补给与通讯联队”，也是为美国中央情报局服务的。这个联队的任务，是根据美国“中央情报局”的指示，向中国和苏联和人民民主国家空投间谍，对地面的间谍特务空投补给物资，与他们保持通讯联络，并在必要的时候把他们从空中取走。这个联队还派出一个“维地”机组附属于美国远东空军轰炸机司令部所属“九一战略侦察中队”，而这个中队是以中国和苏联为战略侦察的目标的。所有这一切事实难道不都是美国侵略集团企图对我国发动新的侵略战争，企图从内部颠覆我国的人民政权的铁的证据吗！美国侵略集团是无法抵赖了。
    人们都知道，美国侵略集团一贯地派遣间谍分子潜入苏联和各人民民主国家，阴谋组织各种破坏活动。早在一九五一年，前任美国总统杜鲁门就批准了一个所谓“共同安全法”，由美国政府公开拨款一亿美元，作为在这些国家的领土上组织和策动破坏、颠覆活动的费用。最近美国国会所通过的一九五四年度和一九五五年度的援外法案中，同样都有一笔专作间谍特务破坏活动的经费开支。美国政府已经先后建立了许多庞大的间谍机构、妄图组成一个对苏联和各人民民主国家进行间谍特务活动的包围圈。但是，敌人的计划到处遭到了可耻的失败。最近几年来，和平民主阵营的各个国家已经相继破获了许多美国间谍进行破坏和颠覆活动的案件。几年来我国各地也陆续破获了一批间谍特务案件，这些都充分显示了社会主义力量和人民民主政权的巩固和强大。但是，我们对于美国侵略者的这种间谍特务破坏活动，绝不能忽视，在今后的斗争中，我们必须更加努力粉碎国内外反革命分子的复辟阴谋，在任何时候也不应该放松警惕。
    刘少奇同志在“关于中华人民共和国宪法草案的报告”中指示我们：“现在美国帝国主义还侵占着台湾，蒋介石卖国集团还盘踞在台湾继续作恶，并且时刻企图回到大陆上来。反动派的复辟仍然是一个实际的危险。如果有人看轻这种危险，那就要犯错误。”因此我们必须经常加强戒备，坚决粉碎一切间谍特务分子的破坏活动。
    为了在这一斗争中取得胜利，我们不仅要进一步加强人民公安机关和司法机关，并且必须广泛深入地开展群众性的防奸反特工作，充分发挥人民群众对敌斗争的积极性。特别是在打击敌人的空投特务活动上，这种群众性的防奸反特工作尤其重要。我们相信，只要各级人民公安机关和人民解放军公安部队经常保持高度的革命警惕，而又善于依靠群众，认真搞好群众性的治安保卫工作，进一步加强和健全民兵组织，那么，敌人派遣来的一切间谍特务分子，不论他们是从陆地、海上或空中进来的，就都无法逃出我国人民的手掌。我国人民是决不许美国间谍特务分子漏网的。美国侵略集团企图颠覆我国人民政权的一切阴谋活动，我国人民是一定能够粉碎的。
