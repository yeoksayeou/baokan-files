Guizhou Province has achieved remarkable results in farmers constructing and repairing agricultural irrigation projects. According to statistics from seventy-four counties, a total of more than 12,800 irrigation projects were constructed this year, and more than 22,700 were repaired, guaranteeing irrigation for more than 657,200 mu of land, completing 164 percent of the province's irrigation project plan for this year. The Zunyi Special District, due to the high importance attached to agricultural irrigation work by the Party and government leaders, achieved particularly significant results, completing 248 percent of its assigned tasks. At the same time, five mechanical pumping stations were established throughout the province, increasing the irrigated area by more than 3,300 mu.

All areas are paying more attention to the management and maintenance of the repaired agricultural irrigation projects than in previous years. Pingtang County trained 108 grassroots cadres in one go to strengthen the management and maintenance of water conservancy projects. It is estimated that the effectiveness of the irrigation projects constructed and repaired this year throughout the province will increase rice production by more than 32 million jin next year.

    贵州省修整农田水利工程三万五千多处
    贵州省农民兴修和整修农田水利工程获得显著成绩。根据七十四个县的统计，今年共兴修了水利工程一万二千八百多处，整修二万二千七百多处，保证了六十五万七千二百多亩田的灌溉，完成了今年全省兴修水利计划的百分之一百六十四。遵义专区由于党、政领导对农田水利工作高度重视，因而成绩特别显著，完成任务数的百分之二百四十八。同时全省还建立了五处机械提水站，增加了灌溉面积三千三百多亩。
    各地对修好的农田水利都比往年更注意了管理养护。平塘县为加强水利工程的管理养护，一次就训练了基层干部一百零八人。据估计，全省今年兴修和整修的水利工程所发挥的效能，明年可增产稻谷三千二百多万斤。
