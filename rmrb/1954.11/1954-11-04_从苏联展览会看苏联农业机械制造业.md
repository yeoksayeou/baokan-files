    Viewing Soviet Agricultural Machinery Manufacturing from the Soviet Exhibition
    Liu Xianzhou, Vice President of Tsinghua University

    After visiting the various agricultural machines displayed at the Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction Achievements Exhibition, we have come to appreciate the unparalleled superiority of socialist agriculture. At the same time, it has allowed us to see the beautiful prospects for the development of our motherland's agriculture, and further strengthened our confidence in building a socialist society.

    The degree of agricultural mechanization in the Soviet Union ranks first in the world. In 1953, there were 93,000 collective farms and more than 4,800 state farms nationwide. Each state farm averaged 19,800 hectares of land - equivalent to 297,000 mu, or 2,970 hectares, in our country. The degree of mechanization of耕作耕地 (gēngzuò gēngdì, cultivation tillage) has reached 98%; the degree of mechanization of sowing has reached 91%; and the degree of mechanization of grain harvesting has reached 77%. The number of tractor stations across the country is close to 9,000, the number of tractors has reached more than 1.2 million, and the number of grain combine harvesters has reached more than 300,000. This fully demonstrates the tremendous achievements of Soviet socialist agricultural construction.

    In 1950, the Soviet Union had already manufactured more than 150 kinds of highly efficient new agricultural machines. Although only more than 50 kinds of agricultural machines are displayed here, except for electric tractors and airplanes for dusting and fertilizing, almost all the main aspects have finished products on display, and they all have their own characteristics.

    The agricultural machinery displayed in the Soviet Exhibition can be roughly divided into the following categories: agricultural prime movers, tillage machines, sowing machines, cultivators, harvesting machines, and crop processing machines, and so on.

    In terms of agricultural prime movers, there are various types of tractors. On the east side of the west square of the exhibition hall, people can see eight different types of tractors, including the famous "Stalin 80" (С—80 type) tractor; in addition, there is a new type of large tractor called "ДТ—54" type tractor, crawler type, with a power of 54 horsepower, a speed of 2.4 to 7.9 kilometers per hour, and a traction force of 1,000 to 2,850 kilograms. It has many advantages, such as economy and durability. Therefore, it is called a "universal operating machine." In terms of tillage machines, there are various plows and harrows. The "П—0—35У" tractor-drawn five-bottom plow displayed in the exhibition hall belongs to this category. This plow has five plowshares and five moldboards, each plowshare has a small front plow in front of it, which can first turn over part of the surface grass, so that all the grass on the ground after plowing is covered under the soil. It has a strong soil breaking force and can plow soil with a resistance of 0.7 kg per square centimeter. If one "Stalin 80" tractor is used to drive two such plows, several hundred mu can be plowed in ten hours a day, with a depth of nine inches. In the southeast corner of the square, people can see the "БДТ2,2" type heavy disc harrow, which is suitable for clay dry land and marshland. Because clay dry land and marshland often produce large and hard clay clods after cultivation. The "ППО—25" type reversible plow with a front plow is the only horse-drawn plow we saw at the exhibition. Its structural feature is that two identical reversible plowshares are installed on one moldboard. Only one side is used when working in one direction, and then the other side is reversed and used when returning. In the past, our country mostly used flat plowshares and moldboards to cultivate slopes and small terraced fields. During cultivation, people tilted the plow to one side to make the ridges turn to one side back and forth, so it was laborious and ineffective. If this kind of reversible plow is used, the problem will be completely solved.

    Sowing machines include sowing machines for crops such as grains, corn, sugar beets, and potatoes (the latest planter is also attached to this category). The structure of this type of machinery is quite complicated. Some combined sowing machines can be used for sowing and fertilizing at the same time, narrow-row sowing machines can be used for sowing narrow-row grain crops, and some sowing machines can be used for cluster sowing (or spot sowing) or square cluster sowing. The structure of the "СКГ—4" type potato square cluster sowing machine is quite ingenious. It can automatically put potato pieces into holes, and simultaneously apply granular fertilizer and then bury them. Replacing manual planting with machinery is a problem that is not easy to solve in the process of agricultural mechanization, but now Soviet engineers and workers have solved it with their own wisdom and creative labor, and created a "СР—6М" type planter. It can be used to plant seedlings of tobacco, cabbage, tomatoes, peppers and other vegetable crops. Its structure is roughly similar to that of a potato sowing machine. The only difference is that it replaces the wheel-shaped frame with a chain sleeve for transporting seedlings; two large water tanks with a total capacity of 700 kg of water are attached to the upper part of the frame for simultaneous irrigation. This gives people a great inspiration: we should study and design a rice transplanter based on the principle of this planter.

    Let's talk about various machines belonging to the cultivator category. From the time a crop emerges from the seedlings until the final harvest, it often needs to be cultivated several times. Its function is to loosen the soil, keep the soil at a certain moisture and temperature, affect the decomposition of fertilizer in the soil; and to remove weeds, so that the crop obtains certain nutrients and moisture (sometimes during cultivation, the work of ridging and topdressing is carried out at the same time). Due to the heavy workload of cultivation, it is necessary to use machinery to carry it out. At the exhibition, everyone can see a "КПС—5,4" type tractor-drawn combined cultivator. It is mainly used for cultivating sugar beets, but it can also be used to cultivate other crops sown with a sugar beet sowing machine. It has the following characteristics in design: the hoe teeth can be replaced to adapt to different types of cultivation work; when the seedlings are young, wing-shaped teeth can also be installed to protect the seedlings. The "КОН—2,8" type potato cultivator for ridging and topdressing can carry out cultivation, ridging and topdressing at the same time.

    There are the most types of harvesting machinery, including grain harvesters, flax harvesters, corn harvesters, sugar beet harvesters, potato harvesters, cotton pickers, mowers and balers, etc. Among them, there is the most famous "С—4" type automatic grain combine harvester (combine), and also the extremely sophisticated "СКЕМ—3" type sugar beet combine harvester and "СХМ—48М" type cotton picker. The cotton picker is also a difficult agricultural machine to design. Its structure mainly includes the following parts: frame, cotton picking mechanism, fallen cotton collecting mechanism, working mechanism suspension device, handwheel lifting device, transmission mechanism, gear reduction mechanism, blower and air duct, cotton storage box and small storage box for collecting fallen cotton, etc. It can automatically pick and collect cotton that has already opened. Its entire working process is like this: when the tractor moves forward with the machine, the cotton rows pass between the two pairs of rollers of the cotton picker; the front of the rollers rotates towards the cotton rows, and the columns it carries rotate in the opposite direction at high speed. All the opened cotton is picked off as soon as it touches the tooth ingot. Outside the rollers, two cylinders with brown brushes and columns are installed, rotating in the same direction. When the columns rotate outward, the cotton on each tooth ingot is knocked down by the brown brush, and then blown by the blower through the air duct into the cotton storage box. If there is any cotton left on the ground during cotton picking, the fallen cotton collecting device will use wind power to send it to the small cotton storage box through a bend pipe. The top of the cotton storage box is sieve-like, and if there are broken leaves mixed in the cotton, they are blown out of the box by wind power. The production efficiency of the cotton picker is 0.2 hectares (three city mu) per hour.

    Finally, I would like to talk about crop processing machines and other various machines. This category includes "straw and green storage material cutter," "УКП" type universal cultivator, "УПХ—1,5" type cotton boll shell remover, "ОКС" type sprayer, etc. A common weakness of general agricultural machinery is that it has a single function, so the annual application time is short, or the utilization rate is low. The latest Soviet "УКП" type universal cultivator overcomes this weakness. As long as the attachments at the rear of the frame are replaced, it can be used for many tasks such as loosening the soil, breaking the soil, weeding, digging ditches, and building embankments.

    从苏联展览会看苏联农业机械制造业
    清华大学副校长　刘仙洲
    参观了苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会中所陈列的各种农业机械，我们体会到社会主义农业的无比优越性，同时，它使我们看到了祖国农业发展的美丽远景，更坚定了我们建设社会主义社会的信心。
    苏联农业机械化的程度已占全世界第一位。一九五三年，全国已有集体农庄九万三千个，国营农场四千八百多个。每个国营农场平均有一万九千八百公顷的土地——相当于我国二十九万七千亩，或二千九百七十顷。耕地的机械化程度已达到百分之九十八；播种的机械化程度已达到百分之九十一；谷物收割的机械化程度已达到百分之七十七。全国拖拉机站的数目已近九千个，拖拉机的数量已达一百二十万架以上，谷物联合收割机的数量已达三十多万台。这充分说明了苏联社会主义农业建设的巨大成就。
    一九五○年苏联已制出效率很高的新式农业机械一百五十多种。这里所陈列的农业机械，虽仅五十多种，但除电力拖拉机和撒粉施肥用的飞机以外，主要的方面几乎都有成品展出，并且都具有各自的特点。
    苏联展览会中陈列的农业机械大体可分为下列几类：农业原动力机、整地机、播种机、中耕机、收获机和作物加工机，等等。
    在农业原动力机方面，有各种类型的拖拉机。在展览馆西广场东边，人们可以看到八架不同类型的拖拉机，其中有著名的“斯大林八十号”（С—80型）拖拉机；此外还有一种新式的大型拖拉机叫“ДТ—54”型拖拉机，链轨式，功率是五十四马力，速度每小时二·四到七·九公里，牵引力一千到两千八百五十公斤。它具有很多的优点，例如经济、耐用。因此它被称为“万能作业机”。在整地机方面，有各种犁和耙。展览馆中陈列的“П—0—35У”型拖拉机牵引的五铧犁，便属于这一类。这种犁共有五个犁铧和五个犁壁，每个犁铧之前各有一个小型的前犁，它可以先把表面的草翻转一部分，使耕后所有地面上的草都覆在土下。它破土的力量很大，能翻耕每平方公分零·七公斤阻力的土壤。若用一架“斯大林八十号”拖拉机带动两个这样的犁，一天工作十小时，就可以耕数百亩，深度达到九寸。在广场的东南角，人们可以看到“БДТ2，2”型重型圆盘耙，它适用于粘土性的旱地和池沼地。因为，粘土性的旱地和池沼地，在耕后多发生很大很硬的粘土块。“ППО—25”型具有前犁的反转犁是我们在展览会上见到的惟一用马拉的犁。它构造上的特点是：在一个犁壁上装有同样的两个可以反转的犁铧，向一方面工作时只用一边，回来时再反转过来用那一边。过去我国耕坡地和小块梯田，多用平板形的犁铧和犁壁。耕种时由人使犁向一边倾斜，使来回的墢片翻向一边，因此费力大，效果又不好。若采用这种反转犁，问题就完全解决了。
    播种机包括谷物、玉米、甜菜等作物和马铃薯的播种机（最新式的植苗机也附在这一类）。这一类机械构造相当复杂，有的联合播种机可用以播种兼施肥，窄行播种机则可用以播窄行谷类作物，有的播种机可用来进行簇播（或称点播）或方形簇播。“СКГ—4”型马铃薯方形丛播机的构造相当巧妙，它可以自动把马铃薯块放入穴中，同时并施放颗粒肥料，然后把它们埋好。用机械来代替人力植苗，是农业机械化过程中很不容易解决的问题，但现在苏联工程师和工人们用自己的智慧和创造性的劳动，把它解决了，创造了一种“СР—6М”型植苗机。它可以用来植种烟草、卷心白菜、番茄、辣椒及其它蔬菜作物的幼苗。它的结构和马铃薯播种机大体相似，所不同的，它只是把轮状架换成一个链套，用以运送苗秧；在机架上部更附装着两个共能容七百公斤水的大水箱，可以同时进行灌溉。这给了人们一个很大的启示：我们应该根据这种植苗机的原理来研究设计一种水稻插秧机。
    让我们来谈谈属于中耕机类的各种机械吧。一种庄稼从幼苗出土以后直到最后收获，其间常常需要进行几次中耕工作。它的作用，一方面可以疏松土壤，使土壤保持一定的水分和温度，影响土壤中肥料的分解；一方面可铲除杂草，使庄稼获得一定的养分和水分（有时在中耕工作中，同时进行培垄追肥的工作）。由于中耕工作的繁重，就有必要使用机械来进行。在展览会上大家可看到一种叫“КПС—5，4”型拖拉机牵引联结中耕机。它主要是用来中耕甜菜的，但也可用它来中耕用甜菜播种机播种的其他农作物。它在设计上有下列几个特点：可以更换锄齿，以适应不同性质的中耕工作；当苗幼小时，还可以装上用以保护幼苗的翼形齿。“КОН—2，8”型马铃薯中耕培垄追肥机，可同时进行中耕、培垄和追肥工作。
    收获机械的种类最多，有谷类收割机、亚麻收割机、玉米收获机、甜菜收掘机、马铃薯收掘机、摘棉机、刈草机和捆草机等等。其中有最著名的“С—4”型自动谷物联合收割机（康拜因），也有构造极精巧的“СКЕМ—3”型甜菜联合收掘机和“СХМ—48М”型摘棉机。摘棉机也是很难设计的一种农业机械，它的构造主要包括以下部分：机架、摘棉机构、收拾落棉机构、工作机构吊挂装置、手轮升降装置、传动机构、齿轮减速机构、鼓风器和送风管、储棉箱和收集落棉用的小储棉箱等。它可以把已经开了的棉花自动摘下并收集起来。它的全部工作过程是这样的：当拖拉机带着机器前进时，棉行在摘棉机的两对滚筒之间经过；滚筒的前边都向着棉行旋转，它带着的各立柱则以高速度按相反的方向旋转，所有已开的棉花，一碰到齿锭就被摘下。在滚筒的外方，各装有两个带有棕刷的圆筒和立柱，按同一方向转动，当立柱转到外方时，各齿锭上的棉花遂被棕刷打下，然后由鼓风器经风管把它吹到储棉箱中。摘棉时如有遗落在地上的棉花，则由落棉收集装置用风力通过弯管把它送到小储棉箱。储棉箱的顶部像筛状，棉花中如杂有碎叶，迳由风力被吹出箱外。摘棉机的生产效能每小时零·二公顷（三市亩）。
    最后，我想谈谈作物加工机及其他各种机械。这一类包括有“蒿秸及青储料切割机”、“УКП”型万能耕作机、“УПХ—1，5”型棉铃铃壳清除机、“ОКС”型喷洒机等。一般的农业机械都有一个共同弱点，就是功用单纯，因此全年应用的时间短，或应用率低。苏联最新式的“УКП”型万能耕作机克服了这种弱点，只要更换了机架后部的附件，它便可以作松土、碎土、除草、挖沟和筑埂等许多工作。
