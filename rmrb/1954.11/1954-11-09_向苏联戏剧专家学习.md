    Learning from Soviet Drama Experts
    Sun Weishi, Vice President of the China Youth Art Theater

    This spring, I received a phone call and learned that Soviet drama expert Platon Vladimirovich Lesly had come to China. This news excited me beyond words, not only because Comrade Lesly was the first Soviet drama expert to come to China to teach, but also because he was one of my teachers when I studied at the Moscow State Theatre Institute. Thinking of this, the scenes of the difficult years of the Soviet Patriotic War immediately emerged before my eyes: When the sound of cannons faintly echoed in the suburbs of Moscow, and amidst constant air raids, the Soviet drama masters insisted on their drama work posts. Whether at the front lines or in the rear, they responded to the call to defend the motherland with touching art. The Theatre Institute continued to hold classes as usual, and the teachers educated the new generation with the great realistic traditions of Shchepkin, Yermolova, and Stanislavsky. The Soviet people loved peace and loved art. The war did not slacken their work and study. The late Soviet People's Artist Mikhail Mikhailovich Dakhnov, who was already over sixty years old at that time, still came to the school two hours early every day to give us classes. In winter, it got light very late in Moscow. At seven o'clock in the morning, the sky was still dark, but he had already arrived at the school. He checked our classrooms to see if we were as clean and tidy as usual; he understood each of us, he knew who came to the school early to prepare, and who rushed in just before class... Under his encouragement, we all studied diligently, because we knew that our current study was an urgent task entrusted to us by the motherland.

    One morning, I went to the institute to attend class and fell while catching the tram, bumping a big lump on my head. When I was sitting in the classroom, Mikhail Mikhailovich walked up to me and asked gently, "What's wrong with you today?" I replied, enduring the pain, "It's nothing." He looked into my eyes and shook his head, "Child, tell me the truth!" Due to his kind concern, I couldn't hold back my tears, and I said, "Mikhail Mikhailovich, forgive me, I fell today." He touched my head and sent a classmate to take me home. He himself was ill (liver cancer) and had difficulty walking, but he still insisted on working. Once I saw him walking slowly on the sidewalk on Gorky Street. I ran up to him, took his hand, and he smiled and asked me, "Do you miss your motherland?" I nodded, and he said, "What the motherland expects of you is to study hard here. After you finish studying, you can do a lot of work when you return to your motherland. This is also what we hope you will do!" Dear Mikhail Mikhailovich, my teacher, I often recall you with the greatest respect and love!

    Soviet Honored Artist Nikolai Mikhailovich Gorkakov is also one of the teachers I often miss. When studying "Director's Conception," he gave me many valuable inspirations. From him, I initially realized how a director should learn from life, how to understand life and accumulate knowledge. During the war years, Soviet students often went to factories, collective farms, state-owned farms, and wounded soldier hospitals to do voluntary labor. After participating in voluntary labor, we would tell him our feelings. When we truly felt happy and educated in the labor, this feeling would become a force for artistic creation and closely combine with the system we were learning. Nikolai Mikhailovich Gorkakov was a wise artist who penetrated the human soul. He sharply and pertinently pointed out some of our shortcomings in experiencing life, making us realize that the education of the Stanislavsky system is the education of life, is the education of thought. Nikolai Mikhailovich's requirements for my studies were strict, but in life, he cared for me so much: At that time, I was the only Chinese female student in the school. Every New Year and holiday, he would invite me to his home to eat. At that time, food was rationed, and a large amount of food was supplied to the front. This festive gathering was saved from his daily rations. I ate and played with his daughter, and he watched us lovingly from the side, making me feel no loneliness of being away from my motherland, but only how happy it was to live in this internationalist family!

    There are too many touching things to tell. Let me talk about the Soviet drama expert Platon Vladimirovich Lesly, who came to China. He is also one of my beloved teachers. He is a sincere, cheerful, and enthusiastic artist. He worked at the Moscow Art Theatre for thirty years and taught at the Moscow State Theatre Institute for twenty years, with rich experience in directing and teaching. This time he came to China as a consultant to the Central Academy of Drama to help us cultivate a new generation of drama workers. In addition to directly leading the teaching work of the directing and acting departments of the Central Academy of Drama, he also opened a training class for directing cadres, gathering outstanding and experienced drama cadres from all over the country to study here. The study time for the directing cadre training class is two years. Under his leadership, the teaching plan of the Moscow State Theatre Institute for one year has been completed in just three months. He was not only my teacher when I studied at the Moscow State Theatre Institute, but this time I assisted him in the directing cadre training class, and I was educated by him again.

    The selection of students for the directing cadre training class is strict. The first is a political examination. Only after passing the political examination are they allowed to participate in the professional examination. Some experienced drama cadres failed the political examination and lost this valuable learning opportunity. This examination further promoted the political study of drama cadres across the country and further clarified the principle of art serving politics.

    In the professional examination process, he did not care how experienced you were or how long you had participated in drama work. He only tested real talent and learning. The so-called "talent" is the endowment of an artist, the sincerity of performance, and the degree of closeness to the Stanislavsky system; the so-called "learning" is the literary cultivation of a drama worker—the understanding of Chinese and foreign literary and drama works, and the general knowledge of art and music, etc. Many drama cadres who had made contributions in literary and art work groups and propaganda teams did not seize the time to study independently in the environment where the country had already achieved victory. Some comrades read too few world literary and drama masterpieces and excellent Chinese classical literature and scripts since the "May Fourth" Movement, and thus lost this valuable learning opportunity. This examination further clarified the importance of literary cultivation for a drama worker, which aroused the attention of theaters across the country to professional study. Currently, the theaters in the capital have stipulated reading lists and plans for actors' self-study, organized actors' amateur recitations, etc., and advocated hard study and hard practice, improving politics, and delving into professional work, all of which are inseparable from this examination of the Central Academy of Drama.

    In addition to completing the teaching work of the Central Academy of Drama, Comrade Platon Vladimirovich Lesly also provided valuable guidance to the performances of theaters in the capital. In the process of the China Youth Art Theater rehearsing Chekhov's famous play "Uncle Vanya," he personally guided the rehearsal, which greatly advanced our work in directing art, performing art, and stage art. He constantly came to guide our work during illness, during his spare time, and on Sundays. His patient and meticulous rehearsal, his repeated explanations and enlightenment, his requirements and demonstrations of physical movements, his kindness, care, and love for us—I find it hard to express our gratitude to him in words. This play is about to meet the audience. The gains from this performance are not only limited to the comrades who participated in "Uncle Vanya," not only the gains of the China Youth Art Theater, but an important event in the history of Chinese spoken drama movement.

    In the process of rehearsing "Uncle Vanya," he also provided valuable opinions on the theater's approach. He believed that a theater must have its own repertoire and should achieve daily rotational performances. If a play is rehearsed and continuously performed for a month or two, then discarded after the performance, and then new plays are rehearsed and continuously performed, this approach is the performance method of capitalist countries. If this continues, the actors with roles will easily become tired and unable to create seriously, the actors without roles will always have no roles to play, the theater will never have its own repertoire, and the quality of performances will never be improved. After a theater has four decent plays, it can carry out rotational performances. New plays are rehearsed during the performance process, gradually increasing the number of performing plays, so that actors will not have nothing to do, the quality of performances will gradually improve, and at the same time, the requirements of the vast audience can be gradually met.

    He believed that the task of theater administration is to create conditions for performances and guarantee performances, rather than interfering in artistic creation. He believed that the theater director should try to establish a performance system with a repertoire, able to carry out rotational performances every day without interruption; and the director's responsibility is to direct good plays. The administration and art of the theater should have clear responsibilities, work together to do a good job in production—performance, to serve the audience and instill communist moral ideas into the audience.

    Platon Vladimirovich Lesly's words and deeds at work have a great educational effect on us. Recently, the Soviet government sent another famous drama expert, Boris Grigorevich Gurnev, to China. In the short days since he came to China, his humility, patience, and hardworking work style have already made Chinese comrades have great respect and love for him. From them, I feel the blood-connected friendship between the Soviet people and the Chinese people, and seeing them makes me think of many respectable and lovable Soviet teachers. Let us strive to learn from the Soviet drama experts, learn from their selfless internationalist spirit, learn from their noble communist moral qualities, learn from their outstanding art—the Stanislavsky system!

### 向苏联戏剧专家学习

    向苏联戏剧专家学习
    中国青年艺术剧院副院长  孙维世
    今年春天，我接到一个电话，知道苏联戏剧专家普拉东·乌拉季米诺维奇·列斯里同志到中国来了。这消息使我兴奋得说不出话来，这不仅因为列斯里同志是第一个到中国来教学的苏联戏剧专家，而且因为他还是我过去在莫斯科国立戏剧学院学习时的老师之一。想到这里，苏联卫国战争艰苦年代的情景就立刻在我眼前浮现出来了：当莫斯科近郊隐隐地响着炮声，在飞机不断的袭击中，苏联的戏剧大师们坚持在他们的戏剧工作岗位上，无论是在前线、在后方，他们都在用感人的艺术，响应着保卫祖国的号召。戏剧学院照常上着课，老师们用史迁普金、叶尔莫洛娃、斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基伟大的现实主义传统教育着新的一代。苏联人民是热爱和平、热爱艺术的，战争并没有松懈他们的工作和学习。已故的苏联人民艺术家米海依尔·米海洛维奇·达尔汗诺夫，那时已经是六十余岁的高龄了，他每天还要提前两小时到学校来给我们上课。在冬天，莫斯科天亮得很晚，早上七点钟，天色还是乌黑的，他已经到学校里来了。他检查着我们的教室，看我们是否还像往常一样的清洁整齐；他了解我们每一个人，他知道谁是一早就到学校来作准备工作，谁是在上课前匆忙赶着来的……在他的鼓舞下，我们都刻苦地学习，因为我们知道，目前的学习就是祖国交付给我们的迫切任务。
    有一天早上，我去学院上课，赶电车摔了一跤，头上碰了个大疙瘩。当我坐在课室的时候，米海依尔·米海洛维奇走到我的面前温和地问我说：
  “你今天怎么啦？”我忍着痛回答道：“没什么，”他望着我的眼睛摇摇头说：“孩子，说老实话吧！”由于他亲切的关怀，我的眼泪止不住地涌了上来，我说：“米海依尔·米海洛维奇，原谅我，我今天摔了一跤。”他摸了摸我的头，派了一个同学把我送回家去。他自己身体有病（肝脏癌），走路都很艰难，但是他还要坚持工作。有一次我在高尔基大街，看见他在行人道上蹒跚地走着，我跑到他面前握住他的手，他微笑着问我说：“想念祖国吗？”我点了点头，他说：“祖国期待你的就是在这里好好学习，学习完了回祖国去可以作许多工作呢，这也是我们盼望你所作的事情！”亲爱的米海依尔·米海洛维奇，我的老师，我经常带着最大的敬意与热爱来回忆着您！
    苏联功勋艺术家尼古来·米海洛维奇·戈尔卡柯夫也是我经常怀念的老师之一。在学习“导演构思”时，他给了我许多宝贵的启发，从他那里我初步认识到作为一个导演应该怎样向生活学习，怎样去认识生活和积累知识。在战争的年代里苏联学生经常到工厂、集体农庄、国营农场、伤兵医院去作义务劳动。我们在参加义务劳动后就把我们的感受讲给他听，当我们在劳动中真正感到幸福、受到教育时，这种感受就变成一种艺术创造的力量，就和我们所学习的体系紧紧结合起来。尼古来·米海洛维奇·戈尔卡柯夫是一个智慧的、渗透人类灵魂的艺术家，他尖锐中肯地指出我们在体验生活中的某些缺点，使我们认识到斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基体系的教育是生活的教育，是思想的教育。尼古来·米海洛维奇对我学习的要求是严格的，而在生活上，他对我又是这样关怀：那时在学校里只有我一个中国女学生，每逢过年过节，他就请我到他家去吃东西，那时候的粮食是定量分配的，大量的粮食都供应前方去了，这种节日的聚会是从他每日的口粮中节约下来的。我和他的女儿在一块吃着玩着，他慈爱地在旁边看着我们，使我感觉不到远离祖国的孤独，只觉得生活在这个充满国际主义的大家庭里是多么地幸福！
    许多感人的事情是怎样也说不完的，让我来谈谈到中国来的这位苏联戏剧专家普拉东·乌拉季米诺维奇·列斯里同志。他也是我热爱的老师之一，他是一位真挚、爽朗、热情的艺术家。他在莫斯科艺术剧院工作了三十年，在莫斯科国立戏剧学院教了二十年的书，有着丰富的导演工作和教学工作的经验。这次他到中国来作中央戏剧学院的顾问，帮助我们培养新一代的戏剧工作者。他除了直接领导中央戏剧学院导演系表演系的教学工作外，还开办了一个导演干部训练班，集中了全国优秀的有经验的戏剧干部在这里学习。导演干部训练班的学习时间是两年，在他领导下仅仅在三个月内就已经完成了莫斯科国立戏剧学院一年的教学计划。他不仅是我过去在莫斯科国立戏剧学院学习时的老师，这次我在导演干部训练班协助他工作的过程中，又受到了他的教育。
    导演干部训练班学员的选拔是严格的，首先进行的是政治考试，只有政治考试及格后才被允许参加业务考试。有些有经验的戏剧干部因为政治考试落了榜，就失掉了这次宝贵的学习机会。这次考试更加推动了全国戏剧干部的政治学习，更加明确了艺术为政治服务的原则。
    在业务考试过程中，他是不管你资格多老，参加戏剧工作的时间有多长，他考的只是真才实学。所谓“才”，就是作为一个艺术家的秉赋，表演的真挚和对斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基体系接近的程度；所谓“学”，就是一个戏剧工作者的文艺修养——对中外文学戏剧作品的理解，对一般的美术、音乐方面的常识等等。许多过去在文艺工作团及宣传队有过贡献的戏剧干部，在全国已经取得胜利的环境下没有抓紧时间自学，有些同志对世界文学戏剧的名著和中国古典文学及“五四”以来的优秀剧本读得太少，因而也失掉了这次宝贵的学习机会。这次考试，更加明确了文学修养对于一个戏剧工作者的重要，这就引起了全国各剧院对于业务学习的重视。目前，首都各剧院规定了演员自学的书目和计划，组织了演员业余的朗颂等，并提倡苦修苦练，提高政治、钻研业务，都是和中央戏剧学院的这次考试分不开的。
    普拉东·乌拉季米诺维奇·列斯里同志除了完成中央戏剧学院的教学工作外，对首都各剧院的演出都作了宝贵的指导。中国青年艺术剧院在排演契诃夫的名剧“万尼亚舅舅”的过程中，他亲临指导排演，使我们在导演艺术、表演艺术、舞台美术各方面的工作都向前迈进了一大步。他在病中、在工作之余、在星期日都不断地来指导我们的工作。他的耐心细致的排演，他的反复解说和启发，他对形体动作的要求和示范表演，他对待我们的亲切、关怀和爱护，我是很难用语言来说出我们对他的感激的。这个戏就要和观众见面了，这次演出的收获不仅限于参加“万尼亚舅舅”的全体同志，不仅是中国青年艺术剧院的收获，而是中国话剧运动史上一件重要的事情。
    在排演“万尼亚舅舅”的过程中，他对剧院的作法上也提供了宝贵的意见，他认为一个剧院必须有自己的上演剧目，应该作到每日轮换演出。如果排出一个戏来，不断地连演一两个月，演完就丢开，然后，再排新的剧目，再不断演出，这种做法，是资本主义国家的演出方法。这样下去，有戏的演员容易疲塌，不能认真地进行创造，没戏的演员就老没戏可演，剧院永远没有自己的保留节目，演出质量也永远不能提高。一个剧院有了四个像样的剧目以后，就可以进行轮回演出。在演出过程中又排新戏，逐渐增加演出剧目，这样演员就不会没事可干，演出质量会逐渐提高，同时又可以逐渐满足广大观众的要求。
    他认为剧院行政的任务就是给演出创造条件，保证演出，而不是干涉艺术创造。他认为剧院院长应该努力设法使剧院建立起保留节目的演出制度，能每日不间断地进行轮换演出；而导演的责任就是要排出好戏。剧院的行政与艺术应该职责分明，齐心合力搞好生产——演出，来为观众服务，将共产主义的道德思想灌输给观众。
    普拉东·乌拉季米诺维奇·列斯里在工作中的一言一行对我们都起着很大的教育作用，最近苏联政府又派来了一位有名的戏剧专家波里斯·格里哥列奇·古尔涅夫到中国来，在他来到中国短短的几日内，他的谦虚、耐心、刻苦的工作作风就已经使中国同志们对他发生极大的尊重和敬爱。从他们身上，我感到苏联人民和中国人民血肉相连的友谊，看见他们，使我想起许许多多可敬可爱的苏联老师们。让我们努力向苏联戏剧专家们学习，学习他们大公无私的国际主义精神，学习他们高贵的共产主义道德品质，学习他们卓越的艺术——斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基的体系！
