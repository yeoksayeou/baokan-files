    The Supreme People's Procuratorate of the People's Republic of China convened a National Procuratorial Work Conference from the 5th to the 21st. The meeting focused on studying how to implement the Organizational Law of the People's Procuratorates of the People's Republic of China and gradually establish a standardized procuratorial system.
    Sixty-three representatives from local People's Procuratorates attended the meeting. The meeting reviewed the progress of procuratorial work since the Second National Procuratorial Work Conference and initially summarized the experience of typical pilot projects and the establishment of operational systems in People's Procuratorates at all levels. The representatives carefully studied the Constitution of the People's Republic of China and the Organizational Law of the People's Procuratorates of the People's Republic of China, and, based on the new situation of procuratorial work in various regions after the promulgation of the Constitution and the principles of the Organizational Law of the People's Procuratorates, discussed and proposed suggestions for future procuratorial work.
    The meeting believed that the primary task of procuratorial work in the future must be to actively develop procuratorial operations and gradually establish a standardized procuratorial system. People's Procuratorates above the provincial (municipal) level and People's Procuratorates in industrial, mining, and key transportation areas should implement various standardized procuratorial operational systems in accordance with the provisions of the Organizational Law of the People's Procuratorates. Other established People's Procuratorates at all levels should also establish various procuratorial operational systems in a planned and step-by-step manner in accordance with the provisions of the Organizational Law of the People's Procuratorates, based on local conditions. In areas where People's Procuratorates have not yet been established, necessary cadres can be allocated first to focus on exercising procuratorial powers to meet the needs of current work, and then gradually expand the work. The meeting believed that in order to gradually establish a standardized procuratorial operational system, it is necessary to continue to vigorously conduct pilot projects of various procuratorial operational systems. The content of the pilot projects should be mainly based on the provisions of the Organizational Law of the People's Procuratorates, and should refer to the experience gained in typical pilot projects and the experience of Soviet procuratorial work. People's Procuratorates at all levels should provide specific guidance to one or two typical pilot units in order to obtain systematic experience to guide overall work.
    The meeting believed that in future procuratorial work, attention should also be paid to organizational development, and procuratorial organs should be established and improved in a planned and step-by-step manner. First, People's Procuratorates above the provincial (municipal) level should be improved, and People's Procuratorates in industrial, mining, and key transportation areas should be strengthened. People's Procuratorates with incomplete institutions should be gradually strengthened, and institutions should be gradually established in a planned manner in areas where People's Procuratorates have not yet been established.
    The meeting concluded that in order to implement the Organizational Law of the People's Procuratorates and carry out procuratorial work, it is necessary to organize existing procuratorial cadres to carefully and thoroughly study the Organizational Law of the People's Procuratorates in a planned manner, understand the content and spirit of the Organizational Law of the People's Procuratorates, gradually and systematically understand the basic principles of procuratorial work, understand the powers and procedures of the procuratorial organs in exercising their powers, improve the professional level of cadres, and learn to master and apply various procuratorial operational procedures to carry out work. At the same time, it is necessary to vigorously carry out the work of training cadres. (Xinhua News Agency)

    最高人民检察院召开全国检察业务工作会议
    中华人民共和国最高人民检察院在五日到二十一日召开了全国检察业务工作会议。会上着重研究了如何贯彻执行中华人民共和国人民检察院组织法，逐步建立正规的检察制度的问题。
    参加会议的有各地人民检察机关的代表六十三人。会议检查了第二届全国检察工作会议以来检察业务建设的情况，并初步总结了各级人民检察机关典型试验工作和建立业务制度的经验。代表们认真学习了中华人民共和国宪法和中华人民共和国人民检察院组织法，并根据宪法颁布后各地检察工作的新情况和人民检察院组织法的原则，讨论和提出了今后检察工作的意见。
    会议认为今后的检察工作首先必须积极进行检察业务的建设，逐步建立正规的检察制度。在省（市）以上的人民检察院和工矿、交通要道地区的人民检察院，要按照人民检察院组织法的规定，施行各项正规的检察业务制度。其余已建立的各级人民检察院也应按照人民检察院组织法的规定，根据各地具体情况，有计划有步骤地建立各项检察业务制度。在尚未建立人民检察院的地区，为适应目前工作的需要，可先调配必要的干部，有重点地执行检察职权，然后逐步展开工作。会议认为，为了逐步建立正规的检察业务制度，还必须继续大力进行各项检察业务制度的试验。试验的内容以人民检察院组织法的规定为主，并参考典型试验中已取得的经验和苏联检察工作的经验。各级人民检察院应具体指导一两个典型试验的单位，以便取得系统的经验，指导全面的工作。
    会议认为今后在检察工作中，还应重视组织建设，有计划有步骤地建立和健全检察机构。首先要健全省（市）以上的人民检察院和充实工矿、交通要道人民检察院，逐渐加强机构不健全的人民检察院，有计划地在尚未建立人民检察院的地区逐步建立机构。
    会议最后认为，为了贯彻执行人民检察院组织法，开展检察工作，必须有计划地组织现有检察干部认真地深入地学习人民检察院组织法，领会人民检察院组织法的内容和精神，做到逐步系统了解检察工作的基本原则，了解检察机关的职权和行使职权的程序，提高干部的业务水平，学会掌握和运用各项检察业务程序进行工作。同时必须大力进行培养和训练干部的工作。　　（新华社）
