Remembering Comrade Luo Guoren, Soviet Expert
　　Cao Yinzhi, Assistant Engineer, Central Laboratory, Technology Department, Anshan Iron and Steel

    In the Central Laboratory of Anshan Iron and Steel, various steel inspection and research experiments are carried out intensively every day. Production problems of more than sixty factories and mines affiliated to Anshan Iron and Steel, as well as the inspection of raw materials and finished products, are solved here. Here, cadres, engineering technicians, and workers alike are proud of their work. We have learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, adopted Soviet scientific and technological equipment, and, under the close guidance of Soviet experts, gradually delved into the front lines, combined the actual conditions in production to promote new technologies, and constantly strived to improve product quality and output. We know that our achievements in our work are inseparable from the selfless assistance of the great Soviet Union, and from the help of our deeply beloved teacher and friend—the late Soviet expert Comrade Luo Guoren.
    Comrade Luo Guoren came to our country in October 1952. After arriving at Anshan Iron and Steel, he immediately began to help the work of the Central Laboratory. At that time, the work of the Central Laboratory was limited to chemical analysis and inspection of products. Comrade Luo Guoren pointed out to us: In addition to chemical analysis and inspection, the laboratory must also frequently delve into the front lines, become familiar with and master on-site production operations, conduct analysis, and organize necessary research experiments. He also emphasized that the laboratory should strengthen its ties with scientific research institutions, universities, and other fraternal factories' laboratories. In this way, Comrade Luo Guoren gave our work a clear direction, and since then, the work of the Central Laboratory has undergone a major transformation.
    I remember those days working under the guidance of Comrade Luo Guoren. Every day, based on the situations occurring on-site and the opinions of comrades, he answered or guided various complex and difficult problems. In the expert's office, leaders and technicians from various factories often gathered to ask for advice. Comrade Luo Guoren always tirelessly introduced the advanced experience of the Soviet Union to us, sharply pointed out various key issues, and repeatedly put forward various suggestions until they were implemented. When solving major problems, it was often possible to see Comrade Luo Guoren delving into the front lines, and then putting forward incisive criticisms or practical suggestions.
    Comrade Luo Guoren often taught us to consider the issues of quality and output from the perspective of the country's interests. He pointed out that products must meet national standards and corresponding technical conditions. He insisted that technicians must establish the concept that "technical regulations are the laws of production," and that production should be carried out strictly in accordance with technical operating procedures. Thanks to Comrade Luo Guoren's help, we solved the production problem of medium plates for steel three according to national standards, and supplied first-class steel rails to the Ministry of Railways according to Soviet technical conditions. Comrade Luo Guoren always adopted an irreconcilable attitude towards phenomena that violated technical operating procedures. He repeatedly and tirelessly introduced advanced technologies and insisted that they be implemented in production and achieve results. For example, the adoption of 5308A type ingot molds and 5041, 5402 type ingot molds, and the promotion of the furnace-by-furnace delivery system, were all implemented because of his persistence, saving the country hundreds of millions of yuan and ensuring the quality of steel billets and steel materials.
    Comrade Luo Guoren had a keen sense of new things. He welcomed every small progress made by comrades in technical thinking and working methods, and promptly gave encouragement and praise. When the Metal Research Institute of the Steel Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry conducted hot processing experiments on nodular cast iron last year, he actively supported it, personally went to visit, and explained its great significance to the comrades. For example, electrical discharge machining is also a new processing method. He foresaw the significance of this method in the laboratory, so he personally guided and urged its successful development, making it possible for us to process some particularly hard steel. Comrade Luo Guoren was very concerned about how to apply spectral analysis, X-ray devices, etc., to the factory's production. He was also very concerned about the cultivation of reserve forces in the laboratory.
    Spending two years with Comrade Luo Guoren, we deeply felt his revolutionary optimism. He often taught us to use a relaxed and cheerful spirit to concentrate on solving the difficulties and problems in our work. He himself was always full of energy. He loved literature and art, and was good at painting and music. He was knowledgeable, talked and laughed cheerfully, and inspired our enthusiasm for work and love for life everywhere.
    Comrade Luo Guoren's workload was astonishing. His huge labor enthusiasm gave us a very profound education. He provided great help to the work of various factories within Anshan Iron and Steel. He put forward many technical and management suggestions for the production of other production units within the company, such as specific opinions on the casting operation of the oil refinery, the heating operation of the primary rolling mill, the quality meeting of the large rolling mill, the work plan of the technical supervision department, the inspection rules of the inspection station, and the liaison system. He not only cared about the work of Anshan Iron and Steel, but also cared about the work and quality problems of laboratories in other fraternal factories. He put forward many suggestions for improvement to the production work of Chongqing 101 Factory, enabling 101 Factory to further improve its work, improve quality, and increase output. His help to the Fushun Steel Plant's laboratory was also comprehensive and meticulous, from sample processing, acid pickling to equipment layout and work organization, he put forward many valuable suggestions. Under his care, not only has a laboratory with a good foundation been established in Anshan Iron and Steel, but also laboratories in other factories in China have been able to carry out their work well. The work of the Anshan Iron and Steel Acceptance Team stationed by the Ministry of Railways also received his continuous help and concern.
    Expert Luo Guoren's help to other scientific research institutions in his work was also enormous. In addition to specifically helping the Metal Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Steel Testing Institute of the Steel Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, and the Anshan Iron and Steel Central Laboratory establish close working relationships to exchange work experience and better integrate theory with practice, he further pointed out working paths and directions of development for the Metal Research Institute and the Steel Testing Institute, helped them formulate work plans, improve work organization, and pointed out correct ways to cultivate talents, enabling them to make significant progress in combining production practice with work. Expert Luo Guoren also tried his best to help the Research Department of Harbin Institute of Technology, Northeast Institute of Technology, and the Railway Research Institute of the Ministry of Railways establish cooperative relationships with Anshan Iron and Steel, so that teaching and production could be combined, and the connection between scientific research and production practice could be further strengthened.
    Comrade Luo Guoren's help to China's steel industry is immeasurable. The reason why the Anshan Iron and Steel Central Laboratory has been able to achieve great results in the past two years and play a significant role in on-site production is the result of Comrade Luo Guoren's direct guidance. From Comrade Luo Guoren, we saw the fine qualities of the Soviet people and their lofty internationalist spirit. Remembering him, we should learn from his internationalist spirit and communist labor attitude, strive to learn and master advanced Soviet scientific knowledge, implement the suggestions of Soviet experts in our work, so that the Central Laboratory can better serve production and strive for Anshan Iron and Steel to complete and overfulfill the national plan.

    忆苏联专家罗国仁同志
    鞍钢技术处中央试验室助理工程师　曹荫芝
    在鞍钢中央试验室里，每天都在紧张地进行着各种钢铁检验和研究试验工作。鞍钢所属六十多个厂矿的生产上的问题，和原料、成品的检验都在这里得到解决。在这里，无论是干部、工程技术人员和工人们都以自己的工作而自豪。我们学习了苏联先进经验，采用了苏联的科学技术设备，在苏联专家们的亲切指导下逐渐深入现场，结合生产中的实际情况推行新技术，为提高产品的质量和产量而不断努力。我们知道，我们工作中的成就是和伟大苏联的无私援助分不开的，是和我们全室同志深深爱戴的老师和朋友——已故的苏联专家罗国仁同志的帮助分不开的。
    罗国仁同志是在一九五二年十月来到我国的。他到鞍钢后，立即开始帮助中央试验室的工作。那时候，中央试验室的工作还仅仅限于产品的化验和检验。罗国仁同志向我们指出：试验室除了化验和检验以外，还必须经常地深入现场，熟悉和掌握现场生产操作，进行分析，并且要组织必要的研究试验。他还强调试验室应当加强和科学研究机关、高等学校以及其他兄弟厂试验室的联系。这样，罗国仁同志给我们的工作指出了明确的方向，从此以后，中央试验室的工作就有了大转变。
    我想起了在罗国仁同志的教导下工作的那些日子。他每天根据现场发生的情况和同志们的意见，回答或指导各种复杂而繁难的问题。在专家办公室里，常常聚集着从各厂前来请教的领导同志和技术人员。罗国仁同志总是不惮烦地为我们介绍苏联的先进经验，尖锐地指出各种关键问题，反复提出各种建议直到贯彻实施而后止。在解决重大问题的时候，常常可以看到罗国仁同志深入到现场，然后提出一针见血的批评或切合实际的建议。
    罗国仁同志经常教导我们，要从国家的利益出发来考虑质量和产量的问题，他指出，产品必须符合国家标准和相当的技术条件。他坚持，技术人员必须树立“技术规程就是生产上的法则”的观念，生产应当严格按照技术操作规程进行。由于罗国仁同志的帮助，我们按照国家标准解决了钢三中板的生产问题，并且按照苏联的技术条件为铁道部供应了头等的钢轨。罗国仁同志对违反技术操作规程的现象从来就采取不调和的态度。他对先进的技术则反复不倦地介绍，一定要在生产中贯彻并取得成效。例如，5308A型钢锭模和5041，5402型钢锭模的采用，按炉送炉制度的推行，等等，都是由于他的坚持，才得到了贯彻，为国家节省了亿万元的财富，保证了钢胚钢材的质量。
    罗国仁同志对新鲜事物有着敏锐的感觉，他欢迎同志们在技术思想和工作方法上的每一个微小的进步，并及时地给以鼓励和表扬。去年重工业部钢铁工业局金属研究所进行球墨铸铁的热加工试验时，他积极支持，亲自前去参观，并向同志们说明它的重大意义。又如电火花加工也是一个新的加工方法，他预见到这个方法在试验室的意义，就亲自指导督促，制作成功，使得我们有可能来加工一些特硬的钢材。罗国仁同志对于光谱分析，X射线装置等怎样应用到工厂的生产中去是十分关心的。他还非常关心试验室后备力量的培养。
    和罗国仁同志相处两年，我们深深地感到他的革命的乐观主义精神。他常常教导我们，要用轻松愉快的精神，集中精力来解决工作中的困难和问题。他自己永远是精神饱满的。他喜爱文艺，擅长绘画和音乐。他知识渊博，谈笑风生，处处启发我们对工作的热情和对生活的热爱。
    罗国仁同志的工作量是惊人的。他的巨大的劳动热情给了我们十分深刻的教育。他对鞍钢内部各厂的工作有着很大的帮助。他对公司内部其他各生产单位的生产提出了很多技术上和管理上的建议，如对炼油厂的铸锭操作、初轧厂的加热操作、大型轧钢厂的质量会议，技术监督处的工作计划，检查站的检查细则、联系制度等都提出了具体的意见。他不但关心鞍钢的工作，而且还关心其他兄弟厂的试验室的工作和质量问题。他对重庆一○一厂的生产工作提出了很多改进的意见和建议，使一○一厂能够进一步提高工作，改进质量和增加产量。他对抚顺制钢厂试验室的帮助也是全面和无微不至的，从试样加工、酸浸一直到设备布置和工作组织都提出了很多宝贵的建议。在他的关怀下，现在不但在鞍钢已经建立了有良好基础的试验室，而且使国内其他各厂的试验室也能够很好地开展工作了。铁道部驻鞍钢验收小组的工作也得到他不断的帮助和关心。
    罗国仁专家在工作上给予其他科学研究机构的帮助也是巨大的，除了具体帮助中国科学院金属研究所、重工业部钢铁工业局钢铁试验所和鞍钢中央试验室建立密切的工作联系，以交流工作经验，更好地使理论联系实际以外，他还进一步给金属研究所和钢铁试验所指出工作途径，发展的方向，帮助他们制定工作计划，改善工作组织，并指出正确的培养人材的办法，使他们在结合生产实际进行工作方面有了显著的进步。罗国仁专家还尽力帮助哈尔滨工业大学研究部、东北工学院、铁道部铁道研究所同鞍钢建立起合作关系，使教学和生产相结合，进一步加强科学研究和生产实际的联系。
    罗国仁同志对我国钢铁工业的帮助是无法估计的，两年来鞍钢中央试验室所以能获得很大的成绩，对现场生产起着很大的作用，是因为罗国仁同志直接指导的结果。我们从罗国仁同志身上看到了苏维埃人民的优良品质，他们的崇高的国际主义精神。我们追念他，就应当学习他的国际主义精神和共产主义的劳动态度，努力学习和掌握苏联先进的科学知识，把苏联专家的建议贯彻到工作中去，使中央试验室能够更好地为生产服务，为鞍钢完成和超额完成国家计划而奋斗。
