Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 23rd. At the suggestion of the Korean-Chinese side, the Korean Military Armistice Commission held a meeting on the 22nd. In accordance with the armistice agreement, the senior member of the Korean-Chinese side, Lieutenant General Li Sang-cho, suggested that the Military Armistice Commission grant special permission for the people of Korea to travel freely between North and South Korea through the Demilitarized Zone and the Military Demarcation Line for non-military purposes. The US side claimed that it would consider this suggestion and respond later.

At the meeting of the Military Armistice Commission, Lieutenant General Li Sang-cho pointed out: There used to be very close ties between the people of all parts of Korea. Because Korea is a single nation, many families, relatives, and friends of the people in the southern half live in the northern half, and many families, relatives, and friends of the people in the northern half also live in the southern half. They used to visit each other constantly, which is only natural. Because Korea is an economic whole, there used to be close economic ties between the northern and southern halves; due to the same cultural traditions, the people of the southern and northern halves used to have very frequent cultural exchanges. However, for a long time, Korea has unfortunately been in a state of division. This close connection between people has been artificially severed. Family members cannot see each other, the economy cannot be connected, and cultural exchanges are impossible. This has caused great misfortune to the family life of tens of thousands of Koreans and has also caused serious damage to the political, economic, and cultural development of the entire Korea. Therefore, the people of all parts of Korea are increasingly urgently demanding the immediate restoration of the long-severed close ties.

Lieutenant General Li Sang-cho said: The Korean armistice should lead to an early peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. To this end, the armistice agreement also stipulates the political settlement of the Korean issue. Unfortunately, the Geneva Conference failed to achieve the desired results in resolving the issue of peaceful reunification of Korea as the Korean people desired. The Korean people continue to suffer from the pain and extreme inconvenience of the southern and northern halves being severed. Now that the armistice has been in place for more than a year, they strongly demand that they be able to travel to various parts of Korea before the entire Korean issue is resolved, in order to visit family members, relatives, and friends, conduct trade, and exchange culture. This reasonable wish should be satisfied. Satisfying this urgent wish of the Korean people will also help to achieve the early realization of a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. To this end, in accordance with the provisions of Clauses 7, 8, and 9 of the armistice agreement, our side suggests that the Military Armistice Commission grant special permission for the people of Korea who wish to travel to the military control areas of both sides for non-military purposes to travel freely through the channels agreed upon by both sides within the Demilitarized Zone.

The draft principle proposal put forward by Lieutenant General Li Sang-cho on behalf of the Korean-Chinese side is as follows:

In view of the fact that the Korean issue has not yet been resolved peacefully, and taking into account the vital interests and wishes of the people living in North and South Korea, the following temporary arrangements shall be taken before the Korean issue is resolved peacefully:

(1) Anyone who lives in the military control area of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers or the military control area of the United Nations Command and intends to visit family members, relatives, engage in trade, cultural exchanges, and other non-military purposes in the military control area of the other party may pass through the northern and southern edges of the Demilitarized Zone and the Military Demarcation Line.

(2) In order to facilitate the travel of those mentioned in the first paragraph to the military control area of the other party, crossing points for those mentioned in the first paragraph shall be established at the mouth of the Han River and at locations agreed upon by both sides on the Military Demarcation Line, and each party shall be responsible for building and maintaining roads leading to each of these locations within its own portion of the Demilitarized Zone.

(3) The travel of those mentioned in the first paragraph shall begin before January 1, 1955.

    就双方准许朝鲜人民为非军事性目的自由来往的问题
    朝中方面在朝鲜军事停战委员会提出建议
    【新华社开城二十三日电】朝鲜军事停战委员会在朝中方面的建议下，二十二日举行会议，朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将根据停战协定，建议军事停战委员会双方特许朝鲜人民为非军事性目的得通过非军事区和军事分界线自由来往于南北朝鲜之间。美方声称：对此建议将予以考虑以后再作答复。
    李相朝中将在军事停战委员会会议上指出：全朝鲜各地人民之间原来存在着非常密切的联系。由于朝鲜是单一的民族，在南半部的人民的许多家属、亲戚、朋友住在北半部，在北半部的人民也有许多家属、亲戚、朋友住在南半部，他们之间原是经常不断地来往进行探访，这本是人情之常；由于朝鲜在经济上是一个整体，北半部和南半部之间原也存在着密切的经济联系；由于同一个文化传统，南半部和北半部的人民在文化交流方面原也十分频繁。然而，长时期来，朝鲜不幸处于分裂的状态，人民之间的这种密切联系被人为地割断，家人无法相见，经济无法沟通，文化无从交流，这使成千成万朝鲜人的家庭生活遭到莫大的不幸，也使全朝鲜的政治、经济和文化的发展遭到严重的损失。因此，朝鲜各地人民愈来愈迫切地要求立即恢复被割断已久的密切联系。
    李相朝中将说：朝鲜停战应该导向朝鲜问题的早日的和平解决。为此，停战协定中也规定了朝鲜问题的政治解决。不幸的是日内瓦会议未能如朝鲜人民所渴望的对于朝鲜和平统一问题的解决获得所期望的成就，朝鲜人民继续遭受着南半部和北半部被割绝的痛苦和极端不便。现在停战已经一年多，他们强烈地要求在整个朝鲜问题解决之前先能来往于朝鲜各地，以便探访家属、亲戚、朋友，进行通商和交流文化。这种合情合理的愿望应当予以满足。满足朝鲜人民的这一迫切愿望也将有助于和平解决朝鲜问题的早日实现。为此，我方根据停战协定第七、第八和第九款的规定，建议军事停战委员会双方特许朝鲜人民为非军事目的要求来往于双方军事控制地区者得经由非军事区内双方协议的通道自由来往。
    李相朝中将代表朝中方面提出的原则建议草案如下：
    鉴于朝鲜问题尚未得到和平解决，并考虑到居住于南北朝鲜的人民的切身利益和愿望，在朝鲜问题得到和平解决之前特采取下列临时安排：
    （一）凡有居住于朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军方面军事控制地区或联合国军方面军事控制地区为访问家属、亲戚，通商，文化交流以及其他非军事目的，拟来往于对方军事控制地区者，得通过非军事区南北缘和军事分界线。
    （二）为提供第一项所述者来往于对方军事控制地区的便利，在汉江口和军事分界线上双方所协议的地点设立第一项所述者的通过地点，并由各方负责在非军事区内本方部分内修筑和维持通到各该地点的道路。
    （三）第一项所述者的来往在一九五五年一月一日以前开始。
