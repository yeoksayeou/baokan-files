    The people of the Oroqen ethnic group, who live in the deep mountains and dense forests of Inner Mongolia, had nowhere to seek medical treatment in the past when they fell ill. Countless people were robbed of their youth and lives by disease. In 1951, with the establishment of the Oroqen Autonomous Banner, the first health clinic serving the Oroqen people appeared. This health clinic was continuously expanded and was converted into a health center last year. From then on, the Oroqen people had a place to treat their illnesses.
    The Oroqen Autonomous Banner is located on the Xing'an Mountains. The territory is mountainous, stretching for hundreds of miles. The hunters live very scattered. The medical staff of the Oroqen Autonomous Banner Health Center often need to travel for several days to reach their destination to treat patients. However, the medical staff do not care about the distance. As soon as they hear that there are patients, they immediately rush to treat them.
    In May 1953, measles was rampant in the Tuozhaming area, and many people fell ill. Doctor Tubuxin from the health center heard the news and hurriedly rode his horse straight to the Tuozhaming Nutuk. When he was only a few dozen miles away from the health center, it started to rain heavily. In order to quickly treat the patients and eliminate measles, Tubuxin braved the heavy rain to reach his destination. There, Tubuxin treated patients day and night, and within a month he cured fifty-five patients suffering from measles.
    During the fire prevention season in spring and autumn, the medical staff of the Oroqen Autonomous Banner Health Center combined their work with forest fire prevention, touring the deep mountains and dense forests to treat hunters and promote health knowledge, so that the hunters gradually developed good habits of cleanliness. Now, the hunters in the Nuomengao'er area of Tuozhaming Nutuk have established a health pact. They often wash and change their clothes, diligently sun their bedding, and clean the "cuo luo zi" (the Oroqen people's dwelling, surrounded by animal skins, shaped like a half-open umbrella). They boil their tableware twice a week and cover them with white cloth after use.
    Due to the vigorous medical work carried out by the health center and the frequent publicity and education of health knowledge to the hunters, infectious diseases such as typhoid fever, measles, and smallpox, which were more prevalent in the mountains and forests in the past, have been basically controlled. When the medical staff of the Oroqen Autonomous Banner Health Center go to the mountains and forests, the hunters warmly entertain them and thank them for eliminating the threat of epidemics to the Oroqen people.

    深山密林中的卫生院
    梅峰
    住在内蒙古深山密林中的鄂伦春族的人民，过去生了病无处求医，不知多少人被病魔夺去了青春和生命。一九五一年，随着鄂伦春自治旗的成立，才出现了第一个为鄂伦春人民服务的卫生所。这所卫生所经过不断地扩充，至去年改成了卫生院。从此，鄂伦春族的人民才有了医治疾病的地方。
    鄂伦春自治旗位于兴安岭上，境内山峦起伏，绵亘好几百里，猎民居住十分分散。鄂伦春自治旗卫生院的医务人员下乡治病，往往需要走好几天才能到达目的地。但是，医务人员却不管路途远近，只要听说有病人，他们立刻跑去医治。
    一九五三年五月，托扎明一带麻疹闹得挺凶，好多人都病倒了。卫生院大夫图布新听到这个消息，急忙骑了马，直奔托扎明努图克。他走到离卫生院不过数十里的地方，大雨哗啦哗啦地下起来了。为了迅速医治病人，扑灭麻疹，图布新冒着大雨赶到了目的地。在那里，图布新日夜为病人看病，一个月内医好了五十五个患麻疹的病人。
    春秋两季防火的时期，鄂伦春自治旗卫生院医务人员结合着护林防火工作，在深山密林中一面巡回地给猎民治病，一面宣传卫生常识，使猎民逐渐养成爱好清洁的良好习惯。现在，托扎明努图克诺门高鲁一带的猎民已订立了卫生公约。他们经常换洗衣服，勤晒被褥，打扫“撮罗子”
  （鄂伦春人居住的寓棚，外面围着兽皮，形如半撑开的雨伞），每星期煮两次食具，使用后并用白布盖起来。
    由于卫生院大力开展医疗工作和经常向猎民进行卫生常识的宣传教育，过去在山林中比较流行的伤寒、麻疹、天花等传染病已基本上被制止了。鄂伦春自治旗卫生院的医务人员走到山林里，猎民们都亲切地招待他们，感谢他们为鄂伦春人解除了流行病的威胁。
