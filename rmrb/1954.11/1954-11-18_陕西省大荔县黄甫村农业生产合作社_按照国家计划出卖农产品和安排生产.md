    Huangfu Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Dali County, Shaanxi Province,
    Sells Agricultural Products and Arranges Production According to National Plan
    The Huangfu Village Agricultural Cooperative in Dali County, Shaanxi Province, actively sells agricultural products and arranges production according to the national plan.
    After the summer harvest, the Huangfu Village Agricultural Cooperative sold its wheat to the state in accordance with the state's unified purchase and sale regulations. In the autumn, the cotton and peanuts planted by the cooperative were promptly sold to the state using the method of harvesting, drying, and selling as they became available. Currently, 26,000 jin of seed cotton and more than 61,000 jin of peanuts have been sold.
    Based on the state's requirement to plant what it needs, the cooperative has already taken active measures in production arrangements: maintaining the original area for wheat; expanding the reserved cotton fields from 170 mu to 187 mu by squeezing out 17 mu of melon fields; and increasing the area for the main oil crop, peanuts, from the original 250 mu to 300 mu by reclaiming barren sandy land. In order to effectively increase the yield per unit area, all cotton seeds and peanut seeds have been selected by grain. The reserved cotton fields will be deep-plowed to a depth of ten inches after the autumn harvest. In addition, the cooperative plans to buy 100 sheep this winter to increase fertilizer, striving to apply base fertilizer to all cotton and peanut fields (except for the 50 mu of newly reclaimed land).

    陕西省大荔县黄甫村农业生产合作社
    按照国家计划出卖农产品和安排生产
    陕西省大荔县黄甫村农业生产合作社积极按国家计划出卖农产品和安排生产。
    黄甫村农业社在夏收后即按照国家统购统销规定把小麦卖给了国家。秋季社里所种棉花、花生都是以随收、随晒、随售的办法及时卖给国家。目前已卖出籽棉二万六千斤，花生六万一千多斤。
    社里根据国家要什么种什么的要求，业已在生产安排上采取了积极的措施：小麦保持原来的面积。用挤掉的十七亩瓜地，把预留棉田由一百七十亩扩大到一百八十七亩；用开垦荒沙地的办法，使主要油料作物花生地由原来二百五十亩增加到三百亩。为了有效地提高单位面积产量，全部棉籽和花生种籽都经过粒选。预留棉田在秋收以后将组织一次十吋的深耕。此外，这个社冬季准备买羊一百只以增加肥料，争取棉地、花生地（新垦五十亩除外）能普遍上一次底肥。（李世季）
