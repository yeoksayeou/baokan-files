    Strive to Improve Railway Transportation Capacity
    Zhengzhou Railway Bureau
    In recent years, the transportation volume of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau has increased year by year with the restoration and development of the national economy. For example, taking the freight tonnage sent in 1951 as 100, it was 115.2 in 1952 and 141.8 in 1953. The planned freight tonnage sent in 1954 increased by 17.7% compared to 1953. The number of loaded cars in the first quarter of this year increased by 11.9% compared to the busiest fourth quarter of last year; the second quarter increased by 11.2% compared to the first quarter; the third quarter was affected by floods, and the southern section of the Beijing-Hankou Railway and the northern section of the Yuehan Railway were once interrupted. A large amount of materials needs to be transported in the fourth quarter, so the transportation volume in the fourth quarter will increase by 27.5% compared to the first quarter. It is expected that in the next few years of the first five-year plan, the transportation volume of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau will increase year by year at a greater speed. This is an inevitable phenomenon when the country enters a period of planned economic construction, and it is also determined by the geographical situation of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau, which is located in the densely populated area of ​​the Central Plains, and along which many emerging industrial cities are being or will be established.
    However, the technical equipment of the lines under the jurisdiction of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau, like other bureaus, is very backward, with poor quality and low efficiency. Although there have been some improvements in recent years, due to our insufficient understanding of the incompatibility between the backward state of existing railway technology and the socialist construction cause, the construction thinking focusing on improving the backward state of existing railway technical equipment and enhancing equipment capacity has not been clear enough in the capital construction work of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau in the past few years, and we have not paid enough attention to the daily maintenance and repair work of fixed assets, so that the consumption of fixed assets has not been compensated for a long time. The backwardness of existing railway technical equipment has brought many difficulties to transportation work. For example, the traction tonnage of the Zhengzhou Station in the four directions of east, west, south, and north are not the same, which increases a lot of trouble when carrying out marshalling operations. The current Zhengzhou Locomotive Depot is limited by the terrain, and the locomotive washing and inspection capacity cannot meet the needs of the increasing transportation volume. Therefore, we must carry out technical transformation step by step in a planned way, improve equipment conditions, enhance equipment capacity, and meet the needs of objective development. The construction of several meeting stations this year to improve traffic capacity is only the beginning of technical transformation.
    Although the equipment of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau is backward and needs to be improved, on the other hand, the potential of the existing equipment is still considerable. It is precisely by relying on giving play to the potential of existing equipment that we can undertake the current increasing transportation tasks. For example, the Wuhan Ferry of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau had a very low ferry capacity in the first quarter of 1953. Later, the staff was organized to visit the Ningpu area, improve the management system and labor organization. In the second quarter, the upstream ferry capacity increased by 32% compared with the first quarter, and it increased to 50% in the fourth quarter. At that time, some people thought that the potential had been exhausted. This year, relying on the enthusiasm and creativity of workers and engineering technicians, the sailing speed has been further improved and the sailing time has been shortened, and the ferry capacity has been significantly improved. The upstream ferry capacity in March has been increased by more than doubled. This fact fully proves that the potential cannot be exhausted. Another example is the Luoyang-Shanzhou mountain slope area, where the downstream throughput capacity is greatly limited. This year, it was originally planned to build a meeting station in the Zhangmao Gorge section, which would involve a large project, a lot of investment, and it would be difficult to see immediate results. Later, after research, it was changed to double-engine traction, and the traction tonnage could be increased by 40%, which quickly and effectively solved the difficulty.
    According to our experience, giving play to the potential of equipment is multifaceted. In terms of train operation organization, compiling more direct trains and concentrating on loading cars in groups has a great effect on reducing shunting operations at marshalling stations and improving the handling capacity of vehicles. Due to the compilation of more direct trains and the concentration of loading cars in groups, the number of untended transfer cars at Zhengzhou Station has greatly increased, increasing by about ten times in the first half of 1954 compared with the same period in 1952, thus the transfer time has been significantly shortened. We still have many shortcomings in train operation organization, and we must pay attention to overcoming the waste of equipment capacity caused by unbalanced transportation, disordered operation order, and failure to earnestly and thoroughly implement the technical operation process. For example, the fluctuation coefficient of transportation volume in the first and second quarters of this year reached 11%, resulting in uneven use of equipment. From January to August this year, only 80.9% of freight trains departed on time, only 76.5% of them ran on time, and the travel speed did not meet the plan. Some even fail to implement or thoroughly implement the marshalling station operation plan, so the vehicle turnaround time has not met the plan either. Undoubtedly, overcoming these wasteful phenomena can unearth great potential.
    We have also begun to pay attention to improving the efficiency of loading and unloading operations and the efficiency of vehicle use. Although the average nighttime operation in the first half of this year reached 41.3%, this achievement is still far from the requirement of 24-hour balanced operation. Since the beginning of this year, we have continued to promote the advanced experience of full-load work, and the static load of freight cars in the first half of the year has increased by 2%. With the deepening of the full-load movement, the load efficiency of vehicles can be further improved.
    Improving the quality of locomotives and reducing the waste of locomotive use is also an important aspect of giving play to our potential capabilities. Thanks to the efforts of the locomotive department, unqualified locomotives have basically been eliminated in the first half of the year. However, with enough high-quality locomotives, they must also be used rationally and economically. At present, the waste of locomotive use at the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau is still serious, such as using main-type locomotives to perform shunting work, and letting small-operation locomotives go their own way, often with insufficient tonnage and axles. These all show that there is also great potential in locomotive use.
    In order to give full play to the potential, the most important and fundamental issue is
  “Resolutely implement the established policy of learning from the Soviet Union, learning and promoting the experience of the original China Changchun Railway.” About two-thirds of the cadres of the leading organs of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau have studied in the original China Changchun Railway Administration or the Harbin Railway Administration, and 80% to 90% of the work systems and management methods are also learned from the China Changchun Railway. Most of the 70 kinds of advanced working methods promoted are also the experience of the China Changchun Railway. However, our work still cannot keep up with the needs. The problem is that we have not learned thoroughly, the implementation is not resolute, the political and professional level of the employees is still very low, and most of the advanced working methods have not been consolidated after promotion. In ideological leadership, the idea of ​​serving transportation is not clear enough, and some cadres emphasize objective difficulties and ignore subjective efforts. The requirements between superiors and subordinates and between departments are not strict. In organizational leadership, there is a lack of regular supervision, inspection and analysis of the implementation of the Ministry of Railways' orders, instructions and suggestions from Soviet experts. For example, the Jiang'an Locomotive Depot recently discovered that 60% of the superior orders could not be found. The superior stipulates that the lines of the marshalling station must be used fixedly, but Zhengzhou Station sends trains without following this principle when it encounters busy transportation, which further increases the chaos of operations. The Zhengzhou Locomotive Depot has never established a normal operating procedure. It is good when it is grasped, and chaotic when it is loosened. It is good during demonstration, and chaotic in daily life. The slackness of various disciplines, especially labor discipline, also seriously affects the improvement of transportation capacity. Since the beginning of this year, according to incomplete statistics, there have been more than 80 cases of violating dispatching discipline, arbitrarily using Ministry reserve cars, loading cars in the wrong direction, and emptying them out of plan. For example, in early September, due to the increase in traffic flow to the west, in order to avoid causing congestion at Zhengzhou Station, the Railway Administration issued a dispatching order prohibiting overloading to the west, but the Zhengzhou Transportation Branch overloaded the Longhai West Line beyond the plan for five consecutive days from September 2 to 6, averaging about 36% beyond the plan every day, resulting in a backlog of traffic to the west. The phenomenon of slack labor discipline is even more common. The prominent manifestation is the large number of accidents. From January to August this year, a total of 1,354 traffic accidents occurred, causing losses of more than 1.4 billion yuan, more than 50% of which were caused by failure to implement regulations and violation of labor discipline.
    The current potential of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau is still very large. All employees of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau are working hard to improve transportation capacity and better meet the country's requirements for railway transportation.

    努力提高铁路运输能力
    郑州铁路管理局
    几年来，郑州铁路管理局的运输量随着国民经济的恢复和发展而逐年增长着。如以一九五一年货物发送吨数为一百，一九五二年则为一百一十五点二；一九五三年则为一百四十一点八。一九五四年计划货物发送吨数又比一九五三年增长了百分之十七点七，今年第一季度的装车数比去年最繁忙的第四季度增长了百分之十一点九；第二季又比第一季增长了百分之十一点二；第三季度因受水害影响，京汉路南段和粤汉路北段都曾一度中断行车，大量物资须在第四季度补运，因此第四季度运量将比第一季度增长百分之二十七点五。预计在第一个五年计划的今后几年中，郑州铁路管理局的运输量将以更大的速度逐年增长。这是国家进入有计划的经济建设时期的必然现象，也是郑州铁路管理局正处于中原人口稠密地带，沿线正在或将要建立许多新兴的工业城市这一地理形势所决定的。
    但是，郑州铁路管理局所辖线路的技术装备，和其他各局一样是十分落后的，质量差、效率低，虽然几年来也有若干改善，但由于我们对现有铁路技术上的落后状态和社会主义建设事业不相称的情况认识不足，因而在郑州铁路管理局过去几年来的基本建设工作中，以改善现有铁路技术装备的落后状态，增强设备能力为重点的建设思想不够明确，对固定资产日常养护维修工作也重视不够，使固定资产的消耗长期得不到补偿。由于现有铁路技术装备的落后给运输工作带来很多困难。例如郑州车站东、西、南、北四个方向的牵引定数都不一致，进行编解作业时就增加了许多麻烦。目前的郑州机务段因受地形上的限制，机车的洗检能力等无法适应运输量增长的需要。因此我们必须有计划的逐步的进行技术改造，改善设备状况，增强设备能力，满足客观发展的需要，今年为了提高行车通过能力新建若干个会让站，也只是技术改造的开始。
    郑州铁路管理局的设备虽然落后，需要加以改善，但另一方面，现有设备的潜在力量还是不小的。我们正是依靠了发挥现有设备的潜在力量，才有可能担负起当前日益增长的运输任务。例如郑州铁路管理局的武汉轮渡，一九五三年第一季渡车能力还很低，后来组织职工到宁浦地区观摩，改善管理制度和劳动组织，第二季度上行渡车能力较第一季度提高了百分之三十二，第四季度更提高到百分之五十，当时曾经有人认为潜力已经挖尽。到了今年，由于依靠了工人和工程技术人员的积极性与创造性，又进一步提高了航行速度，缩短了航行时间，轮渡能力又有显著提高，三月份上行渡车能力已提高了一倍以上。这一事实充分证明潜力是挖不完的。又如洛（阳）陕（州）山坡地带，下行通过能力受到很大限制，今年本来计划在张茅硖区间增建会让站一处，工程既大，投资又多，还难立见功效，后来经过研究改为双机牵引，牵引定数即可增加百分之四十，迅速有效地解决了困难。
    根据我们的体会，发挥设备潜力是多方面的。在行车组织工作上，多编直达列车和集中成组装车，对减轻编组站的调车作业，提高办理车辆能力，有很大的作用。由于多编直达列车和集中成组装车，郑州车站无调车中转车数大大增加，一九五四年上半年即比一九五二年同期增多了约十倍，因而中转时间有了显著的缩短。在行车组织工作上我们还有许多缺点，还必须注意克服运输不均衡，运行秩序紊乱，不认真不彻底执行技术作业过程所造成的设备能力的浪费。如今年一、二季度运量的波动系数即达百分之十一，造成设备使用的忙闲不均。今年一至八月货物列车只有百分之八十点九正点出发，正点运行只达百分之七十六点五，旅行速度也没有完成计划。甚至有的不执行或不彻底执行编组站作业计划，因而车辆周转时间也没有完成计划。无疑的，克服这些浪费现象，可以发掘出很大的潜力。
    我们也开始注意了提高装卸作业的效率和车辆的使用效率，今年上半年夜间作业虽然平均达到百分之四十一点三，但这个成绩距离二十四小时均衡作业的要求还很远。今年以来继续推行满载工作的先进经验，上半年货车静载重提高了百分之二，随着满载运动的深入开展，车辆的载重效率还可以进一步提高。
    提高机车的质量，减少机车运用的浪费，也是我们发挥潜在能力的一个重要方面。上半年由于机务部门的努力，不合格机车基本上趋于消灭。但有了足够的质量良好的机车，还必须合理的经济的运用，而目前，郑州铁路管理局机车运用的浪费还是严重的，如使用主型机车担任调车工作，对小运转机车的掌握放任自流，经常欠吨欠轴，这些都说明在机车运用方面也有很大潜力。
    为了充分发挥潜力，最重要、最根本的问题是
  “切实贯彻学习苏联、学习并推广原中长铁路经验”这一既定不移的方针。郑州铁路管理局领导机关，约有三分之二的干部曾在原中长铁路管理局或哈尔滨铁路管理局学习过，百分之八、九十的工作制度和管理方法也都是从中长铁路学来的，推行的七十种先进工作方法中绝大部分也是中长铁路的经验。但我们的工作仍然赶不上需要，问题就在于学得不透，贯彻得不坚决，职工政治业务水平仍然很低，大部分先进工作方法推广之后未能巩固。在思想领导上，一切为运输服务的思想还不明确，有些干部强调客观困难，忽视主观努力。上级对下级、部门与部门之间的要求也不严格。在组织领导上，对铁道部的命令、指示和苏联专家建议执行情况，缺乏经常的监督检查与分析。如江岸机务段最近发现有百分之六十的上级命令找不着了。上级规定了编组站的线路必须固定使用的原则，而郑州站遇见运输繁忙，便不根据这一原则发送列车，以致更增加了作业的混乱。郑州机务段始终没有建立正常的作业程序，抓了就好，松了就乱，示范时好，日常就乱。各种纪律特别是劳动纪律的松懈，也严重地影响着运输能力的提高，今年以来，根据不完全的统计：违犯调度纪律，擅自动用部备用车、不按限制方向装车、不按计划排空即达八十起以上。如九月上旬由于往西的车流增大，为免造成郑州站堵塞，管理局曾发出调度命令禁止往西超装，而郑州运输分局九月二日至六日连续五天向陇海西线超计划装车，每天平均超出百分之三十六左右，结果造成西去车流积压。劳动纪律的松弛现象则更普遍，突出的表现是事故多。今年一至八月共发生行车事故一千三百五十四件，造成损失达十四余亿元，其中百分之五十以上都是不执行规章以及违犯劳动纪律所造成的。
    郑州铁路管理局目前的潜在力量还是很大的。郑州铁路管理局全体职工正在努力提高运输能力，更好地满足国家对铁路运输的要求。
