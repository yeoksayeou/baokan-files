    Farmers in Sichuan and Shanxi Provinces Improve Farming Techniques in Autumn Planting
    In Sichuan Province, more than ten million mu of wheat and four and a half million mu of rapeseed, excluding the western Sichuan Plain, have mostly been sown.
    To expand the autumn planting area and increase yield per unit area, the province promptly supplied farmers with more than 370,000 jin of "Japanese rapeseed" and a large amount of improved wheat varieties, fertilizers, and farm implements. More than 8,000 pieces of new-style farm implements promoted this autumn have also been put into use during autumn planting. The Fujian Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shima Township, Mianyang County, saw an increase of more than 10,000 jin of rice this year from its 46 mu of paddy fields due to the use of new-style farm implements. As a result, the cooperative members love the new-style farm implements even more and plan to use them to cultivate 80% of their fields during autumn plowing and planting. The Shinian and 30 other agricultural production cooperatives in Longchang County bought 31 new-style walking plows, and the wheat fields they sowed this year were plowed one to two inches deeper than last year. Before sowing, the Sichuan Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry and the various special districts also held wheat and rapeseed technical seminars to exchange and impart advanced techniques, and dispatched cadres to various places to provide technical guidance. Therefore, many areas have implemented row planting with close spacing for wheat. (Our Sichuan Reporter Station)
    In Shanxi Province, more than 17 million mu of wheat fields have been sown. Currently, wheat seedlings are growing vigorously in various places. The 11 million mu of wheat in the Jinan area are already more than two inches tall, and the wheat seedlings sown earlier in Linfen have begun to tiller. All areas have paid attention to the promotion of improved varieties during sowing. In addition to selecting more than 17 million jin of good varieties locally, the province also transferred 1.5 million jin of "Bima No. 1" improved wheat varieties from Shaanxi Province. Most areas have increased the application of fertilizer. The fertilizer application area in the Jinan Special District is generally 15% larger than last year, and the amount of fertilizer applied has increased by one-third. At the same time, all areas have paid attention to modifying seed drills and manufacturing new ones. The Jinan and Changzhi special districts alone modified and manufactured more than 34,400 close-planting seed drills. The Yuci Special District, in addition to modifying seed drills, also newly manufactured 400 close-planting seed drills, thus greatly promoting close planting. The close planting area in the Changzhi Special District reached 20% to 30%, and in Jinan it reached more than 50%.
    To ensure increased wheat production next year, all areas in the province have shifted to winter wheat seedling protection. Wenxi, Jieyu, Jishan, Qinyuan, and other counties have instructed all areas to mobilize the masses to formulate wheat protection covenants, prohibit cattle and sheep grazing, organize militias and hunters to shoot geese, and appropriately carry out winter rolling, harrowing, topdressing, and irrigation to ensure healthy wheat seedling development.

    四川山西两省农民在秋播中改进耕作技术
    四川省一千多万亩小麦、四百五十万亩油菜，除川西平原外，大部地区已下种完毕。
    为了扩大秋种面积和提高单位面积产量，全省及时供应农民三十七万多斤“日本油菜”以及大量小麦良种、肥料、农具等。今秋推广的八千多件新式农具，在秋种中也都使用起来。绵阳县石马乡福建农业生产合作社，今年四十六亩水稻田由于用新式农具耕犁，较去年增产一万多斤稻谷。因此，社员们更加热爱新式农具，秋耕秋种中，计划百分之八十的田土要用新式农具耕耙。隆昌县石碾等三十一个农业生产合作社就买了新式步犁三十一部，今年播种的小麦地都比去年深耕了一两寸。播种前，四川省农林厅和各专署还先后召开了小麦、油菜技术座谈会，交流和传授先进技术，并抽出干部到各地进行技术指导工作，因此，很多地区的小麦都实行条播密植。（本报四川记者站）
    山西省一千七百余万亩麦田已播种完毕。目前各地麦苗生长旺盛，晋南区的一千一百余万亩小麦，已高达二寸以上，临汾播种较早的麦苗已开始分蘖。各地在播种中都注意了优良品种推广工作，全省除当地选出一千七百余万斤良种外，并由陕西省调来“碧蚂一号”良种小麦一百五十万斤。大部地区都增施了肥料，晋南专区施肥面积一般比去年扩大百分之十五，施肥量增加三分之一。同时各地注意了改耧和新制耧工作，仅晋南、长治两个专区就改制密植耧达三万四千四百余台，榆次专区除改耧外还新制了四百台密植耧，因而大大地促进了密植工作，长治专区密植面积达百分之二十至三十，晋南达百分之五十以上。
    为了保证明年小麦增产，全省各地已转向冬季麦苗的保护工作，闻喜、解虞、稷山、沁源等县已指示各地，发动群众制订护麦公约，禁止牛羊放牧，组织民兵、猎人打雁，并适当进行冬季滚压耙耱、追肥灌溉，以保证麦苗健壮发育。（郭石）
