    Forever Be With the Soviet Union and Strive for World Peace and Socialism
    The 37th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution is a glorious festival for the working people of the world. Today, our country and the people of the world are welcoming its arrival with boundless joy.
    The victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution enabled mankind to begin the transition from the decadent old world of capitalism to the new world of socialism and communism. For thirty-seven years, the great Soviet people, under the leadership of the great Communist Party of the Soviet Union, have overcome the intervention of foreign imperialism and the sabotage activities of domestic counter-revolutionaries, and have built their motherland from an economically backward country into a powerful and advanced industrial country. In the Great Patriotic War against fascist aggression, the heroic Soviet people rescued mankind from the direct danger of fascist enslavement. This fully demonstrates the power of the socialist economy and proves that the Soviet system is the most progressive, superior, and rational social system. In the post-war years, the Soviet people not only quickly healed their wartime wounds, but also confidently carried out the lofty cause of building communism.
    From the time of the victory of the October Revolution and the emergence of the Soviet state, the oppressed masses of people all over the world have seen that in the Soviet state, the means of production have become the wealth of all the people, and labor is no longer exploitation, but is to create a happy life for the people themselves. This has made them see their happy future, yearn for the bright tomorrow of human society, and strengthen their confidence in relying on themselves to liberate themselves. Indeed, never in history has there been an event like the October Revolution that has had such a huge impact on the development of the world. Today, from Asia to Europe, nearly one billion people have embarked on the path opened up by the October Socialist Revolution, freed themselves from the shackles of capitalism, and formed a powerful camp of peace, democracy, and socialism.
    The revolutionary struggle of the Chinese people was successful under the brilliant light of the Great October Socialist Revolution. Throughout the entire process of our people's revolution, the Soviet Union gave us tremendous support and sympathy. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet government was the first to establish diplomatic relations with our country, signed the "Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance," and gave us great and selfless assistance in all aspects. After the start of our country's first five-year plan, the Soviet Union agreed to help our country build 141 enterprises. This group of enterprises constitutes the backbone of our socialist economic construction. After their completion, they will lay a solid foundation for our country's national industrialization and defense modernization.
    Recently, during the Sino-Soviet talks held in Beijing, the Soviet Union decided to transfer the Soviet shares of the four Sino-Soviet joint-stock companies to China. Furthermore, in order to further assist our country's construction, it decided to help our country build 15 new industrial enterprises and expand the scope of equipment supply for 141 enterprises. It also donated the machine tools and agricultural machinery exhibited in the Soviet Exhibition Hall, as well as a complete set of machinery and equipment needed for a large state-owned grain farm that can reclaim 300,000 mu of wasteland. In addition, it provided comprehensive technical assistance to our country in the construction of the Lanzhou-Urumqi-Almaty railway. The Soviet Union's extensive expansion of assistance to our country will undoubtedly greatly promote the progress of our country's economic construction and provide a more reliable material and technical foundation for our country to complete its first five-year plan. No matter how much its importance is estimated, it will not be an overestimation.
    The Soviet government and people's continuous assistance to our country fully embodies the great internationalist spirit of the Soviet people and their sincere friendship with the Chinese people. This assistance is fraternal, truly friendly, and truly constructive, and it is built on the basis of mutual assistance and promotion of common progress and prosperity. This is a great manifestation of the new socialist relations, a relationship that has never existed in human history.
    In their congratulatory message to Comrade Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Comrade Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, and Comrade Molotov, First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, on the eve of the 37th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the People's Republic of China, and Comrade Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, said: "The great alliance between China and the Soviet Union is playing an increasingly significant role in promoting the common prosperity of the two countries and safeguarding peace in the Far East and the rest of the world. Recent talks between the Soviet government delegation headed by Comrade Khrushchev and the Chinese government mark a new development in the great friendship between the people of the two countries, and once again demonstrate the common aspirations and common interests of the eight hundred million people of China and the Soviet Union. This friendship will accelerate the socialist construction of the Chinese people and promote the greater consolidation of peace in the Far East and the world." This not only expresses the fraternal and unbreakable friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union, but also expresses the complete unity of the Chinese people's will with the great Soviet people in international affairs.
    Today, the unbreakable friendship and common will of the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union have become a solid pillar for safeguarding world peace and security. The peaceful foreign policy pursued by the governments of China and the Soviet Union is consistent and unwavering. Everyone knows that the principles and policies of peaceful coexistence between countries with different systems and the peaceful resolution of all international disputes were first put forward and consistently upheld by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government. This is because the Soviet Union has no intention of interfering in the affairs of others, and it believes that the people of all countries will inevitably be victorious through their own strength. On the contrary, the reason why the aggressive forces headed by US imperialism want war is because they fear the people, fear progress, hate the people's struggle for freedom, independence, and national rights, and conspire to enslave the whole world.
    Anyone can see that in today's struggle between the forces of peace and the forces of aggression, the propositions of the countries of the peace, democracy, and socialism camp headed by the Soviet Union are increasingly attracting and uniting a wider range of masses. More and more people know that the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy is in line with their fundamental interests. This is just as Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai said in their congratulatory message: "More and more people are in favor of peaceful coexistence. War conspiracies to revive German militarism and Japanese militarism are constantly being resolutely opposed by the German people, the Japanese people, and the people of all countries. The struggle against the establishment of aggressive military blocs and the demand for the prohibition of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, as well as universal disarmament, are being universally launched. All this makes us believe that as long as the people of all countries take on the cause of safeguarding peace and persevere in this cause to the end, world peace can be maintained and consolidated."
    From our own personal experience, the Chinese people deeply know that our friendship with the Soviet Union is not only an important condition for our construction of socialism, but also a major factor in maintaining world peace. Every new achievement of the great Soviet Union strengthens our confidence in building a new life, and also strengthens the power of world peace and democracy headed by the Soviet Union. On the occasion of celebrating the 37th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, let us forever be with the Soviet Union and strive unremittingly for our great cause of socialism and world peace!

### 永远和苏联在一起，为世界和平和社会主义事业而奋斗

    永远和苏联在一起，为世界和平和社会主义事业而奋斗
    伟大的十月社会主义革命三十七周年纪念日，是全世界劳动人民的光辉节日。今天，我国和全世界人民都在以无限喜悦的心情迎接它的到来。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命的胜利，使人类开始从腐朽的资本主义旧世界，走进了社会主义和共产主义的新世界。三十七年以来，伟大的苏联人民，在伟大的苏联共产党领导下，克服了外国帝国主义的干涉和国内反革命的破坏活动，把自己的祖国从一个经济落后的国家，建设成为一个强大的先进的工业国。在反对法西斯侵略的伟大爱国战争里，英雄的苏联人民将人类从法西斯奴役的直接危险中解救出来。这充分说明社会主义经济的威力，说明苏维埃制度是最进步、最优越、最合理的社会制度。在战后的这些年月里，苏联人民不仅迅速医治了自己在战时的创伤，并且满怀信心地进行着建设共产主义的崇高事业。
    从十月革命胜利、苏维埃国家出现的那个时候起，全世界被压迫的人民群众就看到：在苏维埃国家里，生产手段成了全体人民的财富，劳动已不再是被剥削，而是为了创造人民自己的幸福生活。这就使他们看到了自己的幸福的未来，向往着人类社会的灿烂的明天，坚定了依靠自己解放自己的信心。的确，历史上从来没有像十月革命这样，对于世界的发展发生如此巨大影响的。今天从亚洲到欧洲，已有近十亿的人民按照十月社会主义革命所开辟的道路，摆脱了资本主义的羁绊，并结成了强大的和平、民主和社会主义阵营。
    中国人民的革命斗争，就是在伟大十月社会主义革命的光辉照耀下而达到成功的。在我国人民革命的整个过程里，苏联给了我们巨大的支援和同情。在中华人民共和国成立后，苏联政府首先同我国建立了外交关系，订立了“中苏友好同盟互助条约”，并在各方面给了我们以伟大无私的援助。在我国第一个五年计划开始以后，苏联又同意帮助我国建设一百四十一项企业，这批企业构成了我国社会主义经济建设事业的骨干，它们建成后，将为我国国家工业化和国防现代化奠定巩固的基础。
    最近，在北京举行的中苏会谈中，苏联又决定将四个中苏股份公司的苏联股份移交给中国，并且为了进一步援助我国建设事业，决定帮助我国新建十五项工业企业和扩大一百四十一项企业的设备供应范围，还把苏联展览馆内展览的机床和农业机器、把可以开垦三十万亩荒地的大型国营谷物农场所需全套机器和设备赠送给我国，此外在兰州—乌鲁木齐—阿拉木图铁路线的修建中给予我国全面的技术援助。同时，中苏蒙三国政府还发表了关于修建集宁—乌兰巴托铁路并组织联运的联合公报。苏联这样广泛地扩大了对我国的援助，无疑将大大促进我国的经济建设事业的进展，使我国完成第一个五年计划有了更为可靠的物质和技术的基础。它的重要性无论如何估计都是不会过分的。
    苏联政府和人民不断给予我国的援助，充分体现了苏联人民的伟大的国际主义胸怀和对我国人民的真诚友谊。这种援助是兄弟般的真正友好的和真正建设性的援助，它是建筑在互相帮助和促进共同进步和繁荣的基础上的。这是新的社会主义关系的伟大表现，这种关系在人类已往的历史上是从来没有过的。
    中华人民共和国主席毛泽东同志和中华人民共和国国务院总理兼外交部长周恩来同志在伟大十月社会主义革命三十七周年前夕致苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫同志、苏联部长会议主席马林科夫同志和苏联部长会议第一副主席兼外交部长莫洛托夫同志的贺电中说：“中苏两国的伟大同盟对促进两国的共同繁荣和维护远东与世界和平事业日益明显地发挥着极其巨大的作用。最近以赫鲁晓夫同志为首的苏联政府代表团与中国政府的会谈，标志着两国人民伟大友谊的新发展，并再一次表现了中苏八亿人民的一致愿望和共同利益。这种友谊将加速中国人民的社会主义建设和促进远东及世界和平的更加巩固。”这不仅表达了中苏两国人民间兄弟般、牢不可破的友谊，并且表达了中国人民在国际事务上与伟大的苏联人民意志的完全一致。
    今天，中苏两大国家的牢不可破的友谊和共同意志，已成为保卫世界和平与安全的坚固柱石。中苏两国政府所执行的和平外交政策是一贯的和坚定不移的。谁都知道，不同制度国家间的和平共处、用和平方法来解决一切国际争端的原则和政策，就是苏联共产党和苏联政府首先提出来而信守不渝的。这是因为苏联从来没有干涉别人的任何打算，它相信各国人民自己的力量必然胜利。与此相反，以美帝国主义为首的侵略势力之所以要战争，就是因为它们害怕人民，害怕进步，仇视人民为求自由、独立和民族权利所进行的斗争，阴谋奴役全世界的缘故。
    任何人都可以看到：在今天和平势力反对侵略势力的斗争中，以苏联为首的和平民主和社会主义阵营的各国的主张，日益吸引和团结着更广大的群众。日益众多的人们知道：苏联的和平外交政策是符合他们的根本利益的。这正如毛泽东主席和周恩来总理兼外长的贺电中所说的：“赞成和平共处的人越来越多。复活德国军国主义和日本军国主义的战争阴谋不断遭受德国人民、日本人民和各国人民的坚决反对。反对建立侵略性的军事集团，要求禁止原子武器、氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器，以及普遍裁减军备的斗争正在普遍展开。这一切使我们相信，只要各国人民将维护和平的事业担当起来，并且把这一事业坚持到底，世界和平就能够保持和巩固。”
    从自己切身经验中，中国人民深知：我们和苏联的友谊，不但是我们建设社会主义的重要条件，而且是维护世界和平的重大因素。伟大苏联的每一项新的成就都增强着我们建设新生活的信心，也都增强着以苏联为首的世界和平民主的力量。在庆祝伟大十月社会主义革命三十七周年的时候，让我们永远和苏联在一起，为我们伟大的社会主义和世界和平的事业而不懈地奋斗吧！
