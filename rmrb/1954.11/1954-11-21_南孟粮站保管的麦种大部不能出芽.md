Letter Excerpts:

    Most Wheat Seeds Stored by Nanmeng Grain Station Fail to Germinate
    Li Dexiu and Lü Zhiguo of the Third District Government of Ba County, Hebei Province, wrote: Most of the more than 107,000 jin of wheat seeds sold by the Nanmeng Grain Station of Ba County to farmers in the Second and Third Districts of Ba County recently cannot germinate. It is understood that five townships in our district, including Cangshang, Houying, Tashang, Mafang, and Lijiaying, purchased a total of 60,000 to 70,000 jin of wheat seeds from this grain station, which were used to sow more than 5,000 mu of wheat. After sowing, 60 to 70 percent of the wheat seeds could not germinate. The most serious case is in Song Helangying Village, Cangshang Township, where 80 farming households purchased more than 3,900 jin of wheat seeds, and the germination rate is generally only 30 to 40 percent. Farmer Xu Yue purchased more than 90 jin of wheat seeds from Nanmeng Grain Station on September 20. After inspection, six or seven out of ten wheat grains could not germinate. It is understood that the low germination rate of this batch of wheat seeds is mainly due to the grain station's failure to properly store the seeds. The farmers are very dissatisfied with the irresponsible work attitude of Nanmeng Grain Station. For example, farmers in Houying Township said: "The government calls for early planting and increased wheat planting to shorten the disaster period, but the grain station spoiled the wheat seeds. It's really infuriating."
    We believe that the Party and government leading organs of Ba County should pay attention to this issue. In addition to quickly helping the disaster-stricken people solve the difficulty of lacking wheat seeds and mobilizing farmers to replant, necessary measures should be taken against the relevant derelict personnel who caused the loss of wheat seeds to educate them, improve their work, and reverse the adverse effects.

### 南孟粮站保管的麦种大部不能出芽

    南孟粮站保管的麦种大部不能出芽
    河北省霸县三区区政府李德修、吕志国来信：霸县南孟粮站最近卖给霸县二、三区农民的十万零七千多斤麦种大部不能出芽。据了解我区仓上、后营、塔上、马坊、李家营等五个乡共购买这个粮站麦种达六、七万斤，约种麦五千多亩，播种后有百分之六十到七十的麦种都不能出芽。最严重的如仓上乡宋贺郎营村八十户农民所购三千九百多斤麦种，出芽率一般只有百分之三十到四十。农民徐月在九月二十日购买南孟粮站的九十多斤麦种，经检查十个麦粒就有六、七个粒不能出芽。据了解，这批麦种出芽率之所以很低，主要由于这个粮站没有作好粮种的保管工作所致。农民们对南孟粮站这种不负责任的工作态度很不满意，如后营乡的农民说：“政府号召早种和多种麦，缩短灾期，可是粮站偏把麦种保管坏了，真气人。”
    我们认为，霸县党、政领导机关应重视这个问题，除迅速帮助灾民解决缺乏麦种的困难和动员农民重新补种外，并对造成粮种损失的有关失职人员进行必要的处理，以教育本人，改进工作，挽回不良影响。
