Wuxi City is a grain distribution center in the fertile grain-producing area of the Taihu Lake Basin, and has always been known throughout the country as one of the "Four Great Rice Markets." Today, along the Tang River, especially in areas like Beitang, Sanli Bridge, and Huangni Bridge, one can still see remnants of characters like "So-and-so Grain Store" or "So-and-so Warehouse" on the walls. These remnants clearly reveal the transformation of this "Rice Market."

As early as more than sixty years ago, during the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, Wuxi City became a grain station for the feudal imperial family. The "tribute grain" that the feudal imperial family had squeezed from nearby areas was concentrated here for delivery and unloading, and then transported to Beijing via the Grand Canal. Wuxi City's grain industry handled an average of more than one million dan of tribute grain each year. After the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway opened to traffic in 1902, Wuxi City's water and land transportation became developed, and the feudal imperial family further regarded this city as a stronghold for plundering the people's wealth. Merchants from various places also came here to transport grain. At this time, Wuxi City's grain industry developed to more than 130 businesses, and successively built large-scale warehouses and mechanized rice mills. The storage capacity of grain warehouses reached about four million dan. From then on, this city became known throughout the country as the "Wuxi Rice Market."

During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, hyperinflation prevailed, currency devalued repeatedly, and people valued goods over money. This "Rice Market" became a stronghold for bourgeois speculation and profiteering. In 1948, the number of grain stores once soared to more than 300. People called these speculating capitalists "rice weevils." At that time, Wuxi City handled five to six million dan of grain annually. Grain stores lined the Tang River, and the river channel was often blocked by grain boats. The "rice weevils" manipulated the entire grain market. When they wanted to buy grain, they first released a batch of grain to lower the market price, and then bought large quantities; when they wanted to sell, they first bought a batch to make the market price soar before selling in large quantities. The market price of rice often fluctuated, which citizens called "three markets in reverse." Rickshaw pullers had to take the fare to buy rice first, and then send the passengers to their destination. Otherwise, the fare that could buy a liter of rice would not be enough to buy a liter of rice after the passengers were taken to their destination. At that time, the city had a grain shortage population of more than 50,000, who were the objects of exploitation by the "rice weevils." Especially at the end of each year, the "rice weevils" stirred up trouble in the grain market, leading to price increases for other commodities as well, making life even more difficult for the citizens. People described the prices at this time as: "After the fifteenth day of the twelfth lunar month, the river rises by thirty percent." However, unscrupulous merchants called the market after the fifteenth day of the twelfth lunar month "the market of the poor," and the transactions at this time were called "killing the poor ghosts." The working people hated the "rice weevils" to the core. They said: "Meeting a 'rice weevil' means losing a layer of skin." In 1947, the famine victims of Wuxi City once raided the granaries of unscrupulous merchants who hoarded grain and refused to sell it.

After liberation, state-owned commerce led the market, and prices stabilized. Especially after the unified purchase and sale of grain, the state banned the free grain market and reformed private grain merchants. According to the distribution of residents, more than 100 grain supply points were established throughout the city. Grain retail outlets were added in workers' residential areas and working people's residential areas, fully supplying people with food. Rickshaw puller Pan Jiuli said: "Now I can pull the rickshaw back home, boil the water, and then buy rice, and it's not too late." This summer was rainy, and some areas of the city were once flooded. The people's government organized grain sales agents and distributors to continue to supply citizens as usual. The masses in the Fifth District said with emotion: "In the past, for every inch the water rose, the price of goods would jump three times, but this year the price of grain has remained stable as usual." Someone said: "If we had suffered a flood in previous years, only the 'big bellies' could afford grain. How could the working people have any grain to eat?" The grain processing plants distributed throughout the city are now also busy serving the people. Recently, the new fragrant japonica rice processed by various processing plants has begun to be transported in a steady stream to industrial cities in Shanghai, North China, and Northeast China. The current Wuxi City is undertaking the task of exchanging materials between urban and rural areas during the peak season. It connects more than 200 cities, counties, towns, and many villages in the rich Taihu Lake Basin through rivers, railways, and highways. Thousands of tons of materials are transported from the countryside to this city or from the city to the countryside every day. Wuxi City, which was once a stronghold for the feudal imperial family to plunder the people and a bastion for "rice weevils" to speculate and profiteer, has now become a city that serves the people.

    “无锡米市”的变迁
    新华社记者徐文  魏文华
    无锡市是太湖流域丰饶粮产区的粮食集散地，一向以“四大米市之一”著称全国。现在，在塘河沿岸，特别是北塘、三里桥、黄泥桥一带，还可以看到墙壁上残存着的某某粮行或某某堆栈等字样。这些残迹明显地表露着这个“米市”的变迁。
    远在六十多年前，满清光绪年间，无锡市就成了封建皇室的漕粮站。封建皇室从附近各地搜括来的“漕粮”都集中在这里交、卸，然后经运河运到北京去。无锡市的粮食业每年平均承办漕粮一百多万石。一九零二年，沪宁铁路通车以后，无锡市水陆交通发达，封建皇室便进一步把这个城市作为搜括民脂民膏的据点，各地客商也到这里来贩运粮食。这时无锡市粮食业发展到一百三十多家，并相继建造了大规模的仓库和机砻碾米厂，粮食仓库储存量达四百万担左右。从那时起，这个城市就以“无锡米市”著称全国。
    国民党反动统治时期，通货恶性膨胀，货币一再贬值，人心重物轻币，这个“米市”又成了资产阶级投机倒把的堡垒。一九四八年，粮行一度激增到三百多家。人们把这些投机倒把的资本家叫做“米蛀虫”。那时，无锡市全年吞吐粮食达五、六百万石。塘河沿岸粮行林立，河道经常为粮船阻塞。“米蛀虫”们操纵了整个粮食市场，他们要买进粮食时，首先抛出一批粮食，把市场价格压低后再大量买进；要卖出时，就先买进一批，使市场粮价跃涨后再大量卖出。市场上的米价经常动荡不定，市民称之为“回头三市”。人力车工人拉乘客，得先拿车钱买成米，然后再送乘客去目的地，要不然，原可买一升米的车钱，等把乘客拉到目的地后就买不到一升米了。那时全市缺粮人口达五万多人，这些人就是“米蛀虫”剥削的对象。特别是每到年终，“米蛀虫”在粮食市场掀起风浪，带动其他商品也都涨价，市民的生活就更难过。人民形容这时的物价说：过了腊月半，河水涨三成。奸商却把每年农历十二月十五日以后的市场称为“穷汉市”，把这时候的买卖叫做“杀穷鬼”。劳动人民恨透了“米蛀虫”，他们说：碰上“米蛀虫”就得脱落一层皮。一九四七年，无锡市的饥民曾哄抢过囤粮不卖的奸商的粮仓。
    解放后，国营商业领导着市场，物价稳定了。特别是粮食统购统销以后，国家取缔了粮食自由市场，改造了私营粮商。全市按照居民分布情况，设立一百多个粮食供应点，在工人住宅区和劳动人民住宅区，都分别增设了粮食零售处，充分供应人民食粮。人力车工人潘九里说：“现在拉车回来，把水烧开了再买米都不迟。”今年夏季多雨，市内部分地区一度被水淹，人民政府就组织粮食代销店和经销店照常供应市民。五区群众感动地说：过去水涨一寸，物价跃涨三次，今年却粮价平稳如常。有人说：“要是往年遭了水淹，粮食只有‘大肚皮’吃得起，劳动人民哪还有粮食吃。”分布在全市的粮食加工厂，现在也正为人民而忙碌着。最近各加工厂加工的新香粳米，已开始源源运往上海和华北、东北等地区的工业城市。现在的无锡市正担负着旺季城乡物资交流的任务。它通过河道、铁路和公路联系着富饶的太湖流域二百多个市、县、城镇和许多乡村，每天有成千上万吨的物资由乡村运到这个城市，或由城市运往乡村。曾经是封建皇室掠夺人民的据点和“米蛀虫”投机倒把的堡垒的无锡市，现在已成为一个为人民服务的城市。
