Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 15th. The eighty-seven agricultural production cooperatives established in Lalin County, Heilongjiang Province this spring have all achieved bumper harvests. The unit area yield of crops has averaged about 20% higher than that of general mutual aid teams in the area. These eighty-seven agricultural production cooperatives plan to sell more than 3,480,000 jin of grain to the state. Members of the Mingfa and Mingzhan cooperatives in Kaoshan Village proposed to sell all their surplus grain to the state during the harvest. They said that when the cooperatives were short of grain during the busy season of hoeing and weeding, and were on the verge of being unable to work in the fields, the government transferred grain from other places to them, so they could cultivate the land well and obtain a bumper harvest. Now that other areas are suffering from disasters, they should also sell more surplus grain to support the disaster areas. The members of the Daixigui Agricultural Production Cooperative in Hongxi Village, Fourth District, proposed to speed up the threshing and sell the grain to the state as soon as possible. More than twenty women in the cooperative also participated in the night threshing, and have now sold more than 15,000 jin. When the Yongqing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Renhe Village was discussing the amount of feed to be reserved for horses, some people advocated reserving 800 jin per horse. The breeder, Fu Shouxin, suggested that not so much should be reserved. He said, "Whether a horse is fat or thin does not depend solely on the amount of feed, but mainly on timely feeding and diligent feeding in small amounts at night. This year, our cooperative used only eight dou of feed per horse. Next year, one shi plus some soybean cake will be enough." In the end, everyone unanimously agreed with his opinion. This saving alone will allow the cooperative to sell an additional 5,000 jin of grain to the state.

    拉林县新建农业社计划卖余粮三百多万斤
    【新华社哈尔滨十五日电】黑龙江省拉林县今年春季建立的八十七个农业生产合作社，都获得丰收。农作物的单位面积产量平均超过当地一般互助组百分之二十左右。这八十七个农业生产合作社计划卖给国家的粮食达到三百四十八万多斤。靠山村明发、明展两社社员在收割的时候，就提出要把全部余粮卖给国家。他们说，今年忙铲忙?的时候，社里缺粮，眼看就要下不了地，政府从别处给我们调来了粮食，我们才把地耕种好，获得了丰收；现在别的地区受灾，我们也应该多卖余粮，支援灾区。四区红喜村戴喜贵农业生产合作社的社员们提出快拉快打，早日把粮食卖给国家，全社二十多名妇女也参加了夜间打场，现在已经卖出一万五千多斤。仁和村永庆农业生产合作社研究给马留料时，有人主张每匹马留八百斤，饲养员傅守信提出不应留这么多。他说：“马喂的瘦胖不单纯在料多少，主要是喂的及时，夜间勤喂少添，今年咱社每匹马才八斗料，明年留一石再加上点豆饼就足够了。”最后大家一致同意他的意见，仅这一项节省，全社就可多卖五千斤粮食给国家。
