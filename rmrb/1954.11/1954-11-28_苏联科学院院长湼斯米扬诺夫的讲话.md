Comrades! Today, with immense grief, we bid farewell to Andrei Yanuaryevich Vyshinsky, an outstanding statesman, social activist, and great scientist who dedicated his entire life to serving the motherland wholeheartedly.

It is impossible to describe the rich and multifaceted activities of Andrei Yanuaryevich Vyshinsky in just a few words.

The whole world knows Andrei Yanuaryevich as a distinguished diplomat, an excellent spokesperson for the Soviet state, and a tireless fighter for peace and international cooperation.

As a scientist, Andrei Yanuaryevich had broad interests. Academician Vyshinsky wrote more than a hundred scientific papers on law. He wrote very valuable scientific works on the Soviet judicial system and judicial procedures. His monumental research work "The Theory of Legal Evidence in Soviet Law" is a great contribution to Soviet jurisprudence. His scientific and applied work in international law is outstanding.

Andrei Yanuaryevich was not limited to solving problems in Soviet law and international law, but also elaborated and developed Marxist-Leninist theories about the state. The achievements in Soviet jurisprudence are inseparable from the name of Academician Vyshinsky. He was recognized as a leader in legal, scientific and theoretical work.

Andrei Yanuaryevich played a huge role in training talent. He cultivated a whole generation of jurists, experts in international law, and scientific workers. He served as a professor and president of Moscow University. People still clearly remember his outstanding work as the president of Moscow University. The Soviet Academy of Sciences received a great deal of help from Academician Vyshinsky. For many years, he was a member of the Presidium of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. Although he was busy with very important government work, he always cared greatly about the activities of the Academy of Sciences. He was happy for the achievements of the Academy of Sciences, and he was saddened by its setbacks. He always made time to help the Academy of Sciences, assisting it in developing and improving its work.

He was the organizer and first director of the Institute of Law of the Soviet Academy of Sciences.

Andrei Yanuaryevich enjoyed great prestige among Soviet scientists, who regarded him as an outstanding statesman, a talented scientist—a Communist Party member, a man of pure heart.

We will always remember Andrei Yanuaryevich and will work as tirelessly and passionately as he did for the benefit of our motherland.

    苏联科学院院长湼斯米扬诺夫的讲话
    同志们！我们今天怀着万分悲痛的心情向献出了整个生命全心全意地为祖国服务的卓越的政治家、社会活动家和大科学家安德烈·扬努阿里耶维奇·维辛斯基告别。
    要用短短的几句话来叙述安德烈·扬努阿里耶维奇·维辛斯基的丰富的、多方面的活动是不可能的。
    全世界都知道安德烈·扬努阿里耶维奇是一位杰出的外交家、苏维埃国家的出色的发言人和不倦地争取和平和国际合作的战士。
    作为一个科学家，安德烈·扬努阿里耶维奇有广泛的兴趣。维辛斯基院士曾经写了一百多篇关于法律学方面的科学论文。他在苏维埃的审判制度和审判程序方面写过非常有价值的科学著作。他的巨大的研究著作“苏维埃法律中法律证据的原理”是对苏维埃法学的巨大贡献。他在国际法方面的科学上的和应用上的工作是很杰出的。
    安德烈·扬努阿里耶维奇并不仅仅限于解决苏维埃法律和国际法中的问题，而且还阐释和发展了马克思—列宁主义关于国家的学说。苏维埃法学方面的成就同维辛斯基院士的名字是分不开的。他曾被公认为是在法律方面科学和理论工作的领导者。
    安德烈·扬努阿里耶维奇在训练人材方面起了巨大的作用。他培养了一整代的法学家、国际法问题专家和科学工作者。他曾经担任莫斯科大学的教授和校长。人们仍然清楚地记得他担任莫斯科大学校长时的卓越工作。苏联科学院得到了维辛斯基院士很多的帮助。许多年来，他一直是苏联科学院主席团的委员。他虽然忙于很重要的所担负的政府工作，但是他始终极其关心科学院的活动，他因科学院的成就而高兴，因科学院的挫折而不快。他总是挤出时间来帮助科学院，协助它发展和改进工作。
    他是苏联科学院法律研究所的组织者和第一任所长。
    安德烈·扬努阿里耶维奇在苏维埃科学家中享有巨大的威信，他们把他看作是一个杰出的政治家、有才能的科学家——共产党员、一个心地纯洁的人。
    我们将永远记得安德烈·扬努阿里耶维奇，而且将像他一样的不懈地和热情地为我们祖国的利益而努力工作。
