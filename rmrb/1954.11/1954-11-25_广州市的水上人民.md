The still Pearl River runs through Guangzhou, dividing the city into north and south. Along the riverbanks are densely packed boats, home to the more than 60,000 water people who engage in various occupations such as water transport, ferrying, passenger sightseeing, fishing, and sand dredging. Water is their hometown, and boats are their homes. They need water just as farmers need land. They have loved water since they were young, learning to row and swim in it. For hundreds of years, they have worked and lived by the water.

	(I)

They no longer remember when they moved their homes onto the water. But what they remember most clearly is that from their distant ancestors, they were contemptuously called "Tanka people." The rulers at that time did not allow them to take the imperial examinations, did not allow them to marry land people, and even did not allow them to go ashore; going ashore would result in beatings. Generation after generation, they were confined to the water, and the cruel exploitation by feudal heads and the looting by bandits weighed on them like two large stones. "Wharf rent" alone accounted for more than half of their total income, and they had to pay dozens of taxes. Many water residents could not afford these exorbitant taxes and had no place to moor, so they had to squeeze their entire family onto a boat and drift everywhere on the river, enduring hunger and cold. I once interviewed a civilian boat worker named Peng Xia, who had a large boat seventeen years ago, which was the legacy of his grandfather's hard work. But under the oppression of reactionary rule, the large boat was exchanged for a small boat, and finally, they had nothing. His wife took the children ashore secretly to beg for food, and he and his brother became boatmen. For more than a dozen years, he had been wearing clothes covered with patches and covering himself with sugarcane skin and rice straw. Such a miserable life as Peng Xia's was the common fate of the water people.

In the past, many water people went to sea as sailors, but the life of sailors was also very bad. A cadre of the Seamen's Union told me: At that time, almost all ships with power equipment were controlled by reactionary bureaucrats and landlords, who relied on the lives of sailors to smuggle and transport drugs to make money. Many sailors at that time did not earn wages, only sharing "dividends." But there were as many bandits along the river as ants, who knew what would happen on the way? Who knew if they could come back alive? Therefore, sailors began gambling and drinking from the moment the ship left the shore until they reached their destination. When the sailors were lucky enough to return, the little "dividends" they received had long been lost or drunk. And their families—the women and children living on the water—squeezed into a dilapidated boat, crying and expecting them to earn a little money to survive.

Liberation brought a new life to the water people.

At the first Guangzhou Municipal People's Congress, it was announced that the contemptuous term "Tanka people" would be abolished forever and replaced by the term "water people." This news immediately spread to the ears of every water person on the Pearl River, and they were overjoyed and shed tears. The People's Government knew that they had suffered deeply, so it paid special attention to them. First, it led them to overthrow the feudal heads, and the wharves were returned to the water people themselves. It also eliminated armed bandits on the waterways, stabilized social order, and enabled the transportation industry to recover and develop. It also established many welfare undertakings for them.

Now, the water people shoulder the important task of urban-rural exchange. People can see the continuous stream of ships and wooden sailboats, fully loaded with goods, running on the Pearl River every day. Every year during the spring plowing and summer planting seasons, they are fully loaded with bean cakes, fertilizers, cattle, farm tools, and water conservancy equipment to the countryside. When the new grain is harvested, they continuously transport grain and local products from the countryside to the city. Currently, they are rushing to transport a large amount of sugarcane to supply sugar factories. Guangzhou's water transport volume accounts for about 80% of the city's total water and land transport volume. Since last year, due to the development of industry and agriculture and the start of national planned economic construction, the water transport task has become heavier, and an unprecedented prosperous situation has emerged: the off-season is not light, and the peak season is even busier. The daily transport volume of civilian barges alone reaches more than 1,000 tons. With the development of production, the life of the water people has undergone great changes. Before liberation, a civilian boat worker earned at most a pack of cigarettes a day, while now the least they earn is 300,000 to 400,000 yuan a month. Many sailors in the past had no wages, relying only on a little "dividend," while now ordinary sailors have an income of 500,000 to 600,000 yuan a month. Wharf porters used to hand over more than half of their labor income to the feudal heads; now their labor income belongs entirely to themselves, and generally, they can earn 700,000 to 800,000 yuan a month.

From their own experiences, the water people all know how today's happy life came about. They all treat their careers with the attitude of masters and cherish state property. The old days of "stealing everything you load" are long gone. In June of this year, more than a dozen civilian boats loaded with bean cakes were sailing on the turbulent river in a Soviet-style train formation. Suddenly, thick dark clouds floated from afar, and a storm came. In a moment, the calm river stirred up huge waves, and the roof of the boat in front was blown into the river, and the bean cakes were wetted. At this time, if no one immediately rescued them, the weight of the bean cakes would increase due to the moisture, and the boat would be in danger of sinking. The boatmen on the boat next to them saw this dangerous situation, and under the leadership of boatman Liang You, the boatmen bravely rescued them together. They took out their own quilts, clothes... everything that could be used to cover the bean cakes, and climbed up the roof of the boat at the risk to hold down the covering... and finally rescued the boat and the bean cakes. There are many moving examples of cherishing state property like this!

	(III)

The hard-working water women, their husbands and children became sailors, boatmen, and porters, and they themselves carry passengers across the river during the day and return to their moorings at night. This is the first time they have lived a settled life. They use bamboo boards to build broken bridges from the shore to the center of the river. They arrange the boats into neat sections and groups, mooring them on both sides of the broken bridge, and placing jasmine and cockscomb flowers on the bows of the boats or on the bridge ladders. Fat chickens and ducks are raised in cages under the bridge. People walk into here as if walking into a small street. The postman delivering letters presses the house number on the bow of the boat and delivers the letter into the boat, and vegetable vendors and haberdashery sellers shout and sell on the bridge. This day, in this residential boat, I met Lin Yu, a representative who had attended the first National Congress of the All-China Youth Federation. She enthusiastically pulled me to the cooperative department store opposite the wharf. We walked into a small room together, and she said, "My boat is being repaired today, and this is my home too." She emphasized the word "home" heavily. Then she told me that she had just been married for three months, and this was her lover's dormitory and office.

"Your lover is also a water person, right?"

"No, he's from the land, an honest farmer. He came to my district last year to set up a cooperative and that's how we met." She smiled a little shyly. The "rules" of the old society no longer exist.

She also took me to see the ferry wharf. Rows of transport boats were carrying passengers back and forth across the river. Lin Yu told me: The water women have realized the benefits of being organized. Now there are no more quarrels and competition for business, and each boat has an income of about 300,000 yuan a month. Then she pointed to a house diagonally opposite the shore and told me that it was the Water People's Primary School. In the past, there were not many illiterate people on land in Guangzhou, but more than 80% of the water people were illiterate. After liberation, the People's Government has established six water primary schools for them. Now, not only have most of the water people's children enrolled in school, but this year, for the first time, there have been seventeen middle school students. Everyone said, "This is really a big event that has never happened before." In the evening, many water people enter the Water People's Spare-time Cultural School. After work, they go to cultural centers and cultural stations to read various newspapers and books, and learning culture is gradually becoming their habit.

At another wharf, I met Chen Jin, a model midwife who is nearly fifty years old. Her boat is the midwifery station. Regardless of day or night, regardless of wind or rain, she rows her boat to provide free midwifery services for the water people. She has saved countless mothers and babies. I asked her why she was so enthusiastic about midwifery? Her answer was so touching: "The death of a child is the most painful thing for a mother, but in the past, among our water people, more than five out of ten children died. But now the People's Government has set up health stations and maternity hospitals for us. The Party and the People's Government are so concerned about us. Can I not serve my own water mothers and children! Who knows if these children will grow up to be experts in building houses or generals in war?" She laughed heartily after she finished speaking. Because of this, she regards this glorious voluntary labor as more important than everything else at home. The water residents here elected her as a model midwife. She enthusiastically talked to me about the development of health work and how to learn the Soviet method of painless childbirth. She said that many water residents have won health model awards. The water people are particularly grateful to the People's Government for setting up many tap water stations along the river for them. No one drinks the cold and dirty river water anymore.

I sat in Chen Jin's boat and felt very comfortable. The boat was so clean, with all kinds of household daily necessities, such as thermos bottles, mirrors, clocks, etc. The walls of the boat were covered with photos and pictures, as well as midwifery equipment. The kitchen at the stern of the boat was emitting the aroma of stir-fried dishes. All the settings were the same as on land. If it weren't for the occasional swaying of the boat and the smell of the river blowing in, I would have really thought I was sitting in an elegant small room. A feeling of happiness and comfort permeated my whole body.

    广州市的水上人民
    本报记者　艾玲
    静静的珠江，穿过了广州市区，把广州分成南北两部。沿江两岸停泊着密密的船只，这里有从事水上运输、摆渡、载客游览、捕鱼、捞砂等等多种职业的六万多水上人民。水是他们的故乡，船就是他们的家。他们需要水，就像农民需要土地一样。他们从小就喜爱水，在水里学划船、学游泳。几百年来，他们靠水工作着，生活着。
          （一）
    他们已经记不清从什么时候起把家搬到水上来。可是他们记得最清楚的，就是从他们老远的祖先起就被贱称做“蛋家”。那时的统治者不准他们上京考试，不准他们和陆上人民通婚，甚至不准上陆，上陆就要挨打。他们世世代代困居在水上，封建把头的残酷剥削和土匪的抢劫，就像两块大石头一样压在他们头上。单“码头租”就要占去他们全部收入的一半以上，还要缴纳几十种捐税。许多水上居民就因为拿不起这些苛捐杂税，连停泊的地方都没有，只好一家大小挤在一只船上，忍饥挨饿地随着江水到处飘流。我曾访问了一个民船工人，他的名字叫彭虾，他在十七年前曾经有过一只大船，那是他祖父辛勤劳动的遗产。但是在反动统治的压榨下，大船换成了小船，最后什么都没有了。老婆带着孩子偷偷的上岸去讨饭，他和弟弟当了船工。十几年来他一直是穿着盖满了补钉的衣服，盖着甘蔗皮和稻秆。像彭虾这样悲惨的生活，是水上人民共同的命运。
    水上人民中过去有许多人去当海员，海员的生活同样很不好。海员工会的干部告诉我：那时有动力设备的轮船几乎都是反动官僚和地主恶霸所掌握的，他们就靠着海员的生命去走私、运毒品来发财的。当时许多海员挣不到工资，只分“红利”。但是沿江的土匪像蚂蚁一样多，谁知道途中会发生什么事？谁知道自己能不能活着回来？因此海员们从船离岸就开始赌博、喝酒，直到目的地。海员们侥幸回来时，那一点点的“红利”也早输光、喝光了。而他们的家属——居住在水上的妇女和孩子们挤在一只破船里，却哭哭啼啼的期待着他们赚回来一点活命钱。
          （二）
    解放了，水上人民获得了新生。
    广州市第一届人民代表会议上宣布了永远废除“蛋家”的贱称，而代之以“水上人民”的称呼。这个消息立即传到了每个珠江水上人民的耳里，他们欢喜得落泪。人民政府深知他们受难深重，也就特别关怀他们。首先领导他们把封建把头斗倒，码头重归水上人民自己管理。并且肃清了水路武装土匪，安定了社会秩序，使运输事业得到恢复和发展。还为他们办了许多福利事业。
    现在，水上人民担负着城乡交流的重大任务。人们每天都可以看到那川流不息的轮船、木帆船，满载着货物奔驶在珠江水面上。每年春耕、夏种的时候，他们就满载着豆饼、肥料、耕牛、农具和水利器材运往农村去，到新谷登场的时候，又源源不断地从农村把粮食、土特产运到城市来。目前他们正赶运着大量的甘蔗，供应糖厂。广州市的水上运输额占全市水陆运输总额百分之八十左右。去年以来，由于工农业生产的发展，国家有计划经济建设的开始，水上运输任务更重了，出现了空前未有的淡季不淡，旺季更旺的繁荣气象。单是民驳船每天的运输量就达到一千多吨。随着生产的发展，水上人民的生活已起了很大的变化。解放前，一个民船工人一天顶多赚到一包纸烟钱，而现在最少的每月也都得到三、四十万元的工资。海员们过去很多是没有工资的，就靠着一点“红利”，而现在一般的水手每月也都有五、六十万元的收入。码头搬运工人，过去要把自己劳动所得的一半以上交给封建把头；现在他们劳动的收入完全归自己所有，一般的，每月可以赚到七、八十万元。
    从切身的感受中，水上人民都知道今天幸福的生活是怎样得来的。他们都以主人翁的态度对待自己的事业，爱护着国家的财产。旧时代的“十装十偷”等现象早就不存在了。今年六月间，有十几只载满豆饼的民船，以苏联的一列式拖带法在滔滔的江水上驶进着。忽然从远处飘来浓密的乌云，暴风雨来了，一会儿，平静的江水掀起了巨浪，排在前面的一只船的船顶被风刮到江里，豆饼被淋湿了。这时候，如果没有人立刻去抢救，豆饼受水分量加重，船就有沉下去的危险。旁边的一只船上的船工们看到这种危险情况，就在船员梁有的带动下，船员们一同奋勇抢救，他们拿出了自己的棉被、衣服……一切能遮挡的东西，用来遮盖住豆饼，冒险爬上船顶上压住盖顶，……终于把船和豆饼救出来了。像这样爱护国家财产的动人事例是很多的！
          （三）
    热爱劳动的水上妇女，她们的丈夫、孩子当了海员、船工和搬运工人，她们自己就在白天载运客人过渡，晚上回到停泊的地方。这是她们第一次过着定居的生活。她们用竹板搭成的断桥从岸上通到江心，她们把船编成一段、一组整齐地停泊在断桥两边，在船头上或桥梯上安放着茉莉花和鸡冠花，桥下的笼子里养着肥大的鸡鸭。人们走进这里，就像走进一条小街道，送信的邮递员按着船头上的门牌把信递进船里，卖菜的和卖杂货的在桥上高声叫卖。这天，我在这居民船里，见到了参加过中华全国青年第一次代表大会的代表林玉，她健康活泼、热情地把我拉到码头对面的合作社门市部去。我们一道走进一个小房间，她说：“今天我的船修理去了，这儿也是我的家”，她把“家”字说的很重。接着她又告诉我，她刚结婚三个月，这里就是她爱人的宿舍和办公的地方。
      “你的爱人也是水上人民吧？”
      “不，是陆上的，是个老实的农民，去年他到我区上办合作社时和我认识的。”她有点不好意思的笑了。旧社会里的“法规”不存在了。
    她又带我去看了摆渡的码头，一排排的交通船，正载着往返的客人渡江。林玉告诉我：水上妇女们已经体会到组织起来的好处，现在再没有吵架和争生意的现象发生，每只船每月都有三十万元左右的收入。接着她指着斜对面的岸边一所房子告诉我说，那就是水上人民小学校。过去在广州市陆上不识字的人是不多的，但水上不识字的人却有百分之八十以上。解放后人民政府已给他们办了六个水上小学，现在不仅大多数的水上人民子弟都入了学，今年还破天荒地出现了十七个中学生。大家都说：“这真是从来没有过的大事”。傍晚，许多水上人民走进水上业余文化学校。他们工作余暇，就到文化馆、文化站里阅读着各种报刊书籍，学文化渐渐成为他们的习惯。
    在另一个码头上，我遇见了年近五十岁的模范接生员陈金，她的船就是接生站，她不分昼夜，不避风雨，划着船为水上人民义务接生。她不知救过多少个产妇和婴儿。我问她对接生为什么这样热心？她回答得这样感动人：“孩子死是母亲最痛苦的事，可是我们水上人民过去生十个孩子就要死五个以上。而现在人民政府为我们设立了卫生站，留产所，党和人民政府这样关切我们，我还不能为自己水上的母亲、孩子们服务吗！谁知道这些小孩长大是个建筑房子的专家，还是打仗的将军呢？”她说完便哈哈大笑起来。就是因为这样，她把这个光荣的义务劳动看得比家里一切事务还重要，这里的水上居民选她为模范接生员。她热情地给我谈了许多有关卫生工作的开展情况和怎样学习苏联的无痛分娩法，她说许多水上居民都得过卫生模范奖。水上人民特别感激人民政府为他们在沿江设立的许多自来水站，再没有人喝那又冷又脏的江水了。
    我坐在陈金的船里，觉得非常舒适，船里是那么干净，放着各样家庭日常用具，什么暖水瓶、镜子、时钟等等，船壁上挂满着像片和画片，还有那接生的用具，船尾的厨房正发出炒菜的香味。所有的设置和陆上一样，如果不是船身不时地摇晃，和那一阵阵吹来的江水味，我真的以为坐在一间雅致的小房里。一种幸福、舒适的感觉透过我的全身。
