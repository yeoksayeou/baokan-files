In Guangdong Province this year, a large number of junior and senior elementary school graduates who failed to advance to higher education during the summer vacation have, under the active guidance and assistance of local Party and government organs and schools, settled down to engage in industrial and agricultural production. Many also participate in various social activities in their spare time and organize self-study groups for self-improvement.

Party committees, governments, and schools in various localities are very concerned about the future of junior and senior elementary school graduates. They usually pay attention to conducting labor education for students. They widely publicize among district and township cadres and the people, mobilizing cadres and the masses to actively prepare to help junior and senior elementary school graduates who cannot advance to higher education to engage in production. Teachers in various schools also visit the homes of graduates, persuading parents to comfort their children to participate in production when they cannot advance to higher education. After extensive publicity and home visits, most of the graduates who were not admitted have settled down and returned to the countryside and towns. Cadres and the masses welcomed and encouraged them, and many parents also comforted and encouraged them to engage in production labor. For example, the masses in various districts and townships of Xinyi County held meetings to welcome the return of local graduates, and introduced to them the development of agricultural production and the mutual aid and cooperation movement in their areas, encouraging them to participate in the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Those graduates who are willing to participate in various social activities in the township are also given specific arrangements. Cadres and the masses in many places actively try to help graduates solve practical difficulties so that they can settle down to engage in production and participate in social work.

Most of the junior and senior elementary school graduates in various places recognize the principle that advancing to higher education and participating in labor production have equally promising futures. Many people are able to settle down and participate in production even after failing the entrance exams. Among the forty-one junior middle school graduates from the Fourth Middle School of Luoding County who could not advance to higher education, thirty participated in agricultural production, and eighteen of them also worked as night school teachers. In Pingrong Township of the county, thirty-one junior and senior elementary school graduates, under the initiation of the local Communist Youth League organization, formed a self-study group for self-improvement.

In labor production, many junior and senior elementary school graduates have performed very well, and some have even become the backbone of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams, earning praise from parents and the masses. Pan Mingqian, a junior middle school graduate from the Fifth District of Xinyi County, returned to his hometown when there was a severe drought and pest infestation. He took the lead in mobilizing and organizing more than forty farmers to fight against the drought and pests, promoting the drought resistance and pest elimination movement in the entire township. In the work of requisitioning and purchasing grain, he actively publicized the Party's policies and led the members of his mutual aid team to quickly hand in public grain and sell surplus grain. Because he was very active in production and work, the township Communist Youth League organization admitted him as a member, and the Xinyi County Committee of the Communist Youth League also commended him. When the masses in the township talked about him, they said: Such graduates are really good.

Xinhua News Agency. More than 150,000 junior middle school and senior elementary school graduates in Henan Province this year have joined agricultural production; another 13,000 have joined factories, mines, enterprises or other work.

Junior middle school and senior elementary school graduates in cities actively joined industrial production and other production. Junior middle school and senior elementary school graduates in rural areas joined the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement and participated in agricultural production cooperatives or mutual aid teams. Relevant departments in various regions also actively organized them to learn agricultural techniques. The agricultural technology training class held in Zhengzhou Prefecture in August absorbed more than 70% of the junior middle school and senior elementary school graduates who participated in the study this year. Many graduates were also able to apply the natural science knowledge they learned to agricultural production. Guo Yujing, a senior elementary school graduate from Gangwang Township, Tenth District, Ye County, used the natural science knowledge he learned in school and the experience of grafting fruit trees he learned from old farmers to graft 7,800 peach seedlings and more than a dozen pear trees, and he also prepared to try grafting apple trees. Under the leadership of local cadres, he and several classmates organized an agricultural study group to study agricultural techniques. Many junior middle school and senior elementary school graduates who actively participated in labor production have been praised by the masses and were elected as the chairmen, vice-chairmen, and team leaders of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams; some also served as accountants, bookkeepers, work recorders, and statisticians for agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams.

The cultural propaganda work in rural areas has added many new forces because of these junior middle school and senior elementary school graduates. Many of them became propaganda workers and newspaper readers for the propaganda network.

    广东省各地党政机关和学校
    积极指导未能升学的毕业生从事生产工作
    河南省初中和高小毕业生参加生产的有十六万多人
    广东省今年暑期未能升学的初中、高小毕业生，在各地党政机关和学校的积极指导和帮助下，很大部分已安心转入工、农业生产劳动，不少人还在业余时间参加各种社会工作和组织自学小组进行自修。
    各地党委、政府和学校对初中、高小毕业生毕业后的出路问题都十分关心。平时便注意到对学生们进行劳动教育；在区、乡干部和人民群众中广泛展开宣传，动员干部、群众积极做好帮助不能升学的初中、高小毕业生投入生产的准备工作；各校教师也到毕业生的家里访问，说服家长安慰自己的子弟在不能升学时参加生产。经过广泛的宣传和进行家庭访问后，未被录取的毕业生大部分都安心地回到农村和市镇去，干部和群众都欢迎和鼓励他们，很多家长也安慰勉励他们从事生产劳动。如信宜县各区、乡群众都开会欢迎当地毕业生的归来，并向他们介绍本处农业生产和互助合作运动开展情况，鼓励他们参加互助合作运动，毕业生们有愿意参加乡中各项社会工作的，也给他们作具体的安排。很多地方的干部和群众积极设法帮助毕业生解决实际困难，使他们安心投入生产和参加社会工作。
    各地初中、高小毕业生大多数都认识到升学和参加劳动生产同样有前途的道理，很多人在没有考取以后也能安下心来参加生产。罗定县第四中学不能升学的四十一名初中毕业生中，参加农业生产的便有三十人，其中有十八人还兼做了夜校教师。该县平榕乡有三十一个初中、高小毕业生在该乡青年团组织的发动下，成立了自学小组进行自修。
    在劳动生产中，不少初中、高小毕业生表现得很好，有的还成为农业生产合作社和互助组的骨干，得到家长和群众的称赞。信宜县第五区初中毕业生潘明乾，回乡时适值旱情和虫害严重，他带头发动和组织了四十多个农民和旱灾、虫害作斗争，推动了全乡的抗旱除虫运动；在随征带购工作中，他又积极宣传党的政策，并带动自己互助组的组员很快交清公粮和卖出余粮。由于他在生产中、工作中都很积极，乡青年团组织便吸收他为团员，青年团信宜县委员会也表扬他。该乡的群众谈到他时都说：这样的毕业生确实好。

    河南省今年的初中和高小毕业生，投入农业生产的有十五万多人；另有一万三千多人参加了厂矿企业或其他工作。
    城市中的初中和高小毕业生积极地投入了工业生产和其他生产。农村中的初中、高小毕业生投入了农村互助合作运动，参加了农业生产合作社或互助组。各地区有关部门也积极组织他们学习农业技术。郑州专区八月间举办的农业技术训练班，吸收今年初中、高小毕业生参加学习的就占百分之七十以上。不少毕业生还能把自己学得的自然科学知识运用到农业生产上去。叶县十区岗王乡高小毕业生郭玉镜按照在学校里学得的自然科学常识以及向老农民学习来的接种果木经验，接种了桃树苗七千八百株、梨树十多株，还准备试接苹果树。在当地干部的领导下，他又和几个同学组织了一个农业学习小组，学习农业技术。有不少积极参加劳动生产的初中、高小毕业生受到了群众的称赞，被推选为农业生产合作社社长、副社长、互助组长；也有些人当了农业生产合作社、互助组的会计、记账员、计工员和统计员。
    各地农村的文化宣传工作，因为有了这批初中、高小毕业生，增添了许多新的力量。他们中间有许多人当了宣传网的宣传员和读报员。  （新华社）
