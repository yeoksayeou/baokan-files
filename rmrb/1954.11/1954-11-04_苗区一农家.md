A Farmhouse in the Miao Area
Tan Jun

Around the National Day this year, I visited the family of Miao farmer Hong Yaolu.

Hong Yaolu lives in a village in Jishou County, Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Region, Hunan Province. Mountains surround this Miao village like city walls, and a clear stream flows through it. The terraced fields, some stretching all the way to the mountain tops, and others dropping to the dark mountain feet, resemble a spider web.

This is Xiaoxi Township.

When I stepped into the village, it was already quite dark. Only Hong Yaolu's father was at home. Although he is fifty-seven years old, his face is dark and plump, and his shoulders are broad and thick. He looks even stronger than when I saw him last year. When he saw me walk in, he said enthusiastically, "It's been a long time since you came! I've been looking forward to it! I’ve been looking forward to it today! Come and rest! Come and rest!" Then, he told me that Hong Yaolu and his wife, Shi Yuanying, had both gone to the farmers' association meeting.

The house is still the same, but it is tidied up very neatly. On the walls of the main room are posted portraits of Chairman Mao and many pictures. Below the portrait of Chairman Mao are many large and small rectangular, eye-catching red cloth strips. These are the credentials of Hong Yaolu for attending meetings in the province and county. On the floor is a high pile of foot-long, abundant, and lovely corn cobs.

Hong Yaolu's father is quite talkative! His words flowed out like water from a breached river embankment: "This year, the weather has been continuously rainy, and the mountains are always flooded. My one mu and three fen of paddy fields were flattened by the water. The other three mu of fields were flowering and budding when they were washed by the rain. In the past, I wouldn’t have expected any harvest. But this year, I still harvested more than fifteen *yun* of dried grain (one *yun* of grain is about 130-140 *jin*)."

He paused slightly. "The mutual aid team is really good. There's strength in numbers. My rice was flattened by the water, and as soon as the water receded, the mutual aid team only took half a day to prop it all up." As he said this, Hong Yaolu and Shi Yuanying came back, talking and laughing. As soon as they entered the door, they said with the same enthusiasm and frankness, "The grain has been brought into the house. Now that you've come to our house, you should stay for a few more days."

Before I could ask, Hong Yaolu told me about their meeting. When he talked about the planned supply of cotton cloth, the old man listened and began to talk about the improvement in clothing since liberation. He said, "Take my family for example. Before liberation, we didn't even have enough to eat. If we picked up a few *jin* of cotton, we thought of saving it to weave some cloth to wear, but in the end, we always reluctantly took it to the street to exchange for food. Now, with Chairman Mao's leadership, we have stood up. We don't have to worry about food. If we pick up cotton, we can weave some cloth ourselves. Sometimes we even have to go to the cooperative to buy cloth. Yaolu alone bought more than two *zhang* last year and sewed three new clothes. My little grandson 'Daosheng' wears all new clothes bought from the store, cloth with red flowers, cloth with green flowers, sewn all over new, all over with flowers..."

His family went to the hillside to pick corn and dig soil to prepare for autumn planting, and they cooked breakfast as soon as it dawned.

When it was time to eat, large and small bowls were set on the table. "If it were before liberation, we could only eat rice and such savory dishes during the New Year and festivals." Hong Yaolu specifically explained to me, as if afraid I wouldn't understand.

As soon as the topic touched on the past, there were many bitter stories.

For generations, Hong Yaolu's family had farmed the land for the big local tyrant landlord "Nine Thousand Nine" (meaning he owned enough rice fields to produce nine thousand nine hundred *yun* of grain). Facing the yellow earth with their backs to the sky, they worked tirelessly day and night, yet they couldn't eat rice for thirty days a year and always lived on wild vegetables and coarse grains. Although they also had forty loads of tung tree land, during the puppet government period, forty loads of tung oil couldn't even be exchanged for six hundred *jin* of rice. Later, no one even wanted it, so his family had no intention of managing it. By the year before liberation, it was all destroyed. Coupled with the Kuomintang's numerous exorbitant taxes, such as monthly donations, doorplate donations, and wick fees, Hong Yaolu had to pay more than three *dou* of rice (one *dou* equals forty *shi jin*) in monthly donations alone. As a result, his family's life became worse and worse. Every day, they relied on selling firewood to get half full. During festivals, they could only lick the "salt packet" to taste the salt.

After liberation, Hong Yaolu's family's life improved day by day. During the land reform, his family was allocated three mu and six fen of land and four mountain slopes. They also joined the mutual aid team, and the fields yielded good harvests every year. In 1953 alone, they harvested twelve *yun* of dried grain from the fields, and the corn and miscellaneous grains harvested from the land were carried in loads and bundles. They also chopped more than 10,000 *jin* of firewood in the mountains, selling it for more than 500,000 yuan. From last autumn to this spring, his income from agricultural production and sideline production totaled more than 3,200 *jin* of grain.

The bumper harvest brought a happy life to this Miao family. Since the autumn harvest of 1952, his family has been able to eat white rice for seven months of the year. In the past, the bamboo basket was often empty of salt. Now, they can eat four *jin* of salt every month. During the New Year and festivals, eating meat is no longer a rare thing. Last Spring Festival, they slaughtered a 100-*jin* pig for the first time to celebrate the New Year. In the past, they had no shoes to wear in the dead of winter, and their feet were so frozen that they cracked and bled. Now, the whole family has three pairs of rubber shoes. They also have pens and flashlights. The whole family made new cotton clothes in the winters of the past two years.

The destroyed tung forests have also been restored, and ten more loads of tung tree mountain land have been added. The tung trees have grown as tall as a person. In another two or three years, they will be able to collect tung oil in loads and bundles, which will further improve the life of Hong Yaolu's family. The current life, in the words of the local Miao farmers:

"It's a big somersault compared to the past." The future life will naturally be even more beautiful.

What makes his whole family most satisfied and the whole village most envious is that Hong Yaolu and Shi Yuanying are as close as one person. They are excellent in their thinking, work, and production.

During the land reform, Shi Yuanying was eighteen or nineteen years old. In terms of labor, she could handle everything, both heavy and light. The young people in the village all loved her. But she only loved one person.

At that time, Hong Yaolu was a member of the Communist Youth League and a public security commissioner in the township. He was particularly active in fighting bandits and struggling against landlords. He and Shi Yuanying often attended meetings together, and they also went to night school together at night. He always patiently helped Shi Yuanying with the words she couldn't write and didn't recognize. In this way, the two slowly fell in love in their work and labor. Before long, this loving couple got married.

The family finished breakfast.

Shi Yuanying held her seven-month-old fat baby, Daosheng, fed him milk, and hurriedly sent him to the baby-holding group of the mutual aid team. Hong Yaolu picked up the straw sandals that Shi Yuanying wore, put on the straw laces, and hammered the straw laces until they were soft. "You love Yuanying so much! You're even afraid of hurting her feet!" I said jokingly. Hong Yaolu smiled slightly, and a little blush appeared on his face. At this time, Hong Yaolu's mother cleaned up the dishes and said with great emotion: "The baby-holding group is really good. In the past, when I went to the hillside to produce, I had to carry the child on my back. The sun was sweating on my head, and my stomach was burning hot. Both adults and children suffered, and production was not good. Now that my son is sent to the baby-holding group, the mother doesn't have to worry." Pointing to the abundant corn cobs that shone brightly in the sunlight, Hong Yaolu's father continued: "It's always right to listen to Chairman Mao. Organizing mutual aid teams will develop both production and life. In the past, when I was busy with the fields, I couldn't take care of the land. How could I grow so much corn? This year, I harvested twenty loads of corn!"

Through the publicity and education of the general task, the light of socialism has illuminated the entire Xiangxi Miao area. Their mutual aid team is preparing to use practical actions to improve production and strive to transform into an agricultural production cooperative. In order to strive to transform into an agricultural production cooperative, Hong Yaolu's family plans to plant all six mu of land with autumn crops such as rapeseed, buckwheat, and wheat, to ensure that they exceed their grain production targets, support national industrialization, and support the struggle to liberate Taiwan.

When I left his house, Hong Yaolu and his wife went to the hillside with hoes on their backs, and his father also went to the hillside with a basket on his back to pick corn.

The beautiful prospects of socialism encourage the Miao people and the people of all ethnic groups in the motherland to advance together. I am deeply moved by the changes in this Miao family in the past five years, no, it is the ever-changing changes in the entire Miao people. How great the changes are! The changes are still constantly changing, and in a few more years, how many times better will it be than today!

    苗区一农家
    谭军
    今年国庆节前夕，我访问了苗族农民洪耀禄的家庭。
    洪耀禄住在湖南省湘西苗族自治区吉首县的一个寨子里。群山像城墙一样拱卫着这个苗寨，一条清澈的溪流从寨里穿过，一层层的梯田，有的一直伸展到山顶，有的又落向黑糊糊的山脚下去了，像蜘蛛网一样。
    这就是小溪乡。
    当我踏进寨子里，天色已经大黑了。洪耀禄家里，只有他的父亲在屋里。他虽说是五十七岁的人，但脸孔又黑又胖，肩膀又宽又厚，比较去年我见他时，更显得健壮了。他见我走进来，热情地说着：“好久没见你来，好盼望，今天盼望到了！快歇歇！快歇歇！”接着，他告诉我，洪耀禄和妻子石元英都到农会开会去了。
    房子里虽说还是老样子，但收拾得挺干净，堂屋的墙壁上，贴着毛主席像和好些画。毛主席像的下面，还钉着大的小的许多长方形的闪眼的红布条，这是洪耀禄上省里、县里开会的代表证。地板上高高的堆着一尺来长的丰硕可爱的苞谷穗子。
    洪耀禄的父亲可健谈啊！他的话像决开了河堤的水一样哗哗地流出来：“今年这个年成，雨没有歇脚，山里总发水，我的一丘三亩的冲田，禾被水抹倒了，另外三亩田，正在扬花打苞的时候，又遭雨洗，要是过去，哪想还有收成？可是今年还是满满的收得了十五运多些干谷（一运谷约合一百三、四十斤）。”
    他稍微停了一下。“互助组硬是好，人多力量大。我的禾被水抹倒，一等退水，互助组只用半天就把它全扶起来了。”说到这里，洪耀禄和石元英两口子，有说有笑的回来了。一进门，他俩同样热情爽朗地说：“谷收进了屋，这次来我家里，该多住几天了。”
    洪耀禄没等我发问，就把他们开会的情形告诉我。讲到棉布计划供应，老头子听着听着就讲起解放以后穿衣方面改善的情形来。他说：“拿我家讲，解放以前，要吃的都没有，拣得几斤棉花，心里想留着织点布穿，到头总是忍心拿了上街换回吃的来。现在有了毛主席领导，翻身了，吃的不用操心，拣了棉花，也就可以自己织些布穿了，有时还要上合作社买布回来。单只耀禄去年就买了两丈多，缝得三件新衣服。我的小孙孙‘道生’通身穿的都是买来的，红花的布，绿花的布，缝的通身是新，通身是花……”。
    他一家子要上坡去摘苞谷和挖土，准备秋种，天刚大亮就煮好了早饭。
    吃饭的时候，大碗小碗摆上一桌子。“要是解放以前，想吃大米饭和这样有咸味的菜，除了过年过节那是没有的。”怕我不明白似的，洪耀禄特意对我说明。
    话题一接触到过去，苦水可就多啦。
    洪耀禄家祖祖辈辈给大恶霸地主“九千九”（意有九千九百运谷田）洪格六种田，面对黄土背朝天，成年累月没早没晚地做，一年还吃不上三十天的大米饭，总是吃野菜杂粮过日子。虽然还有四十挑桐子地，可是，在伪政府时期，四十挑桐子还换不上六百斤大米，到后来甚至没有人要了，他一家子也就无心经营。到解放前的头一年，就全部毁了。又加上国民党的苛捐杂税繁多，如什么月月捐、门牌捐，捻子费等等，洪耀禄每年光月捐就得出三斗多米（一斗合四十市斤）。这样，他家的生活更是一天不如一天，每天靠卖柴换得半饱，逢年过节才能舐舐“盐包”，尝尝盐味道。
    解放后，洪耀禄家的生活就一天天好起来。他家在土地改革中分得三亩六分田，四块山坡，又参加了互助组，田里地里年年得到了好收成。单一九五三年，田里满满打了十二运干谷，地里收的苞谷杂粮也是成挑成担的，山里还劈了一万多斤木柴，卖得五十多万元，从去年秋收到今年春天，他的农业生产和副业生产的收入，合成谷共有三千二百多斤。
    丰收给这个苗族家庭带来了幸福的生活。从一九五二年秋收以后，他家每年就有七个月时间能吃上白米饭。以前箩子里经常没盐装，现在每月能吃上四斤盐了。过年过节时，吃肉也不是什么稀罕的了，去年春节，第一次杀了一头一百斤重的猪过年。以前，十冬腊月没有鞋子穿，冻得脚板裂开，冒着血珠；现在全家有了三双胶鞋。钢笔和手电筒也有了。前年和去年冬天，全家大小都做了新棉衣。
    过去毁了的桐林也重新恢复过来，还扩大了十挑桐子的山地，桐树已长得一人高，再过两三年就可成挑成挑的收捡桐子，这将更进一步改善洪耀禄全家的生活。现在的生活用当地苗族农民的话说：
  “比过去可就翻了个大跟斗。”今后的日子自然还会过得更美的。
    使得他全家最满意和全寨群众最羡慕的还是：洪耀禄和石元英夫妻俩亲密得活像一个人。他俩不论在思想上、在工作上、在生产上都是好样的。
    还在土地改革时，石元英十八、九岁了，在劳动方面，粗的细的样样拿得起，放得下。寨里的青年人人都爱她。可是她只爱一个人。
    那时，洪耀禄是青年团员，乡里的治安委员，在打土匪、斗争地主中都特别积极。他和石元英经常在一起开会，夜晚又一同上夜校读书。石元英不会写和不会认的字，他总是耐心帮助石元英。就这样，两个人在工作中和劳动中慢慢就互相爱起来了。没有好久，这一双爱人就结婚了。
    一家子吃完了早饭。
    石元英抱着她那七个月的肥胖小儿——道生，喂饱了奶，就匆匆送到互助组的抱娃娃组去。洪耀禄拿起石元英穿的草鞋，套好了草练，又把草练捶得软软的。“你好疼元英啊！连她的脚皮都怕挂破了！”我开玩笑似地说着，洪耀禄微微笑着，脸上泛起了一点红晕。这时洪耀禄的母亲收拾好了碗筷，颇为感慨地对我说：“抱娃娃组真是好。在过去，我上坡生产，背上要背着小儿，头上太阳晒的出汗，肚子炙的火热火热，大人小儿都吃亏，生产也搞不好。现在有儿子送到抱娃娃组，免得做娘的操心。”指着那在太阳光的映射下闪闪发亮的丰硕的苞谷穗子，洪耀禄父亲接着也说：“听毛主席的话总是没有错，组织互助组，生产生活都得发展，往年，我忙了田里，就顾不了地里，那里能种这么多苞谷，今年子我的苞谷满满收了二十挑啊！”
    经过总任务的宣传教育，社会主义的光芒照亮了整个湘西苗族地区。他们的互助组预备用搞好生产的实际行动，争取转为农业生产合作社。洪耀禄一家子为了争取转为农业生产合作社，准备把六亩田都种上油菜、荞子、麦子等秋作物，保证超额增产粮食，支援国家工业化，支援解放台湾的斗争。
    我走出他家时，洪耀禄夫妻俩背着锄头上坡去了，他的父亲也背着箩，上坡摘苞谷去了。
    社会主义的美好远景，鼓舞着苗族人民和祖国各族人民一道前进。我为这一个苗族家庭五年来的变化，不，这是整个苗族人民日新月异的变化，深深激动着。变化多大啊！还在不停不断的变化，再过几年，又会比今天好多少倍啊！
