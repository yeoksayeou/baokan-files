Striving for Disarmament and the Prohibition of Weapons of Mass Destruction
Li Yanning

The United Nations General Assembly unanimously adopted on November 4th the joint proposal of Canada, France, the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom on the issue of disarmament. The views of the Soviet Union and Western countries on this important issue are now much closer, and the issue of disarmament and the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction, which has been deadlocked for many years, has thus gained the possibility of progress. This is the result of the constructive efforts of the Soviet Union. If Western countries are truly sincere and work together diligently, it is entirely possible to reach a final agreement on this issue.

The five-nation joint proposal stipulates that the United Nations Disarmament Commission and its Subcommittee (composed of Canada, France, the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom) continue to conduct research to seek a solution acceptable to all, in order to reach an agreement to conclude an international disarmament convention. The proposal also affirms that the Disarmament Commission and its Subcommittee should base their work on the Disarmament Commission's report and the proposal submitted by the Soviet Union to the United Nations General Assembly on September 30th of this year. The five-nation proposal is the first unanimous action taken by the four major powers in the United Nations on such a major issue since 1946. V. Y. Vyshinsky, head of the Soviet delegation, pointed out that although this proposal is an agreement between the five countries on procedural issues, its significance far exceeds the nature of procedure. This proposal is actually a certain program for the work of the Disarmament Commission and its Subcommittee. Vyshinsky also pointed out that the joint submission of this proposal by the five countries shows that they believe that it is possible to work together in the future to achieve final success. Vyshinsky's estimates correctly indicated the significant political significance of the five-nation proposal. This result will have a great effect on the resolution of the disarmament issue itself and on further promoting the relaxation of international tensions.

As everyone knows, it has been nine years since the first session of the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution at the initiative of the Soviet Union, affirming the principle that atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction should be prohibited and that general disarmament should be carried out. For nine years, the Soviet Union has consistently worked actively to achieve the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction and substantial disarmament. At each session of the United Nations General Assembly, the Soviet Union has put forward proposals to resolve this issue. However, the ruling circles in the United States have consistently pursued a policy of arms expansion and war preparation, attempting to obstruct the genuine implementation of disarmament and the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction by investigating the armaments and troops of various countries. Britain, France, and some other Western countries have also followed this position of the United States. Therefore, year after year, discussions have been held in the United Nations, but the issue has remained unresolved, and the differences between the two sides' views remain large.

However, the issue of disarmament and the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction is a major issue related to the peace and security of all countries. Because the Western countries' expansion of armaments has brought an increasingly unbearable burden to the people of capitalist countries, and because of the development of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons, especially because the warmongers in the United States are doing their utmost to advocate new wars and are actually implementing the policy of using weapons of mass destruction as the cornerstone of American military policy, the voices of people around the world demanding disarmament and the elimination of the threat of atomic war are rising higher and higher. Therefore, it is even more urgent for countries to reach an understanding on this issue.

In the period before the convening of this session of the United Nations General Assembly, a particularly favorable atmosphere emerged. International tensions have eased to some extent, and more and more people support the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems. The results of the Geneva Conference proved that it is possible to resolve even very difficult disputes through consultation. It is clear that in this favorable atmosphere, if the deadlock on the disarmament issue can be broken, it will not only have a direct bearing on the resolution of the issue itself, but will also have a favorable impact on further easing the international situation, improving relations between countries, and resolving other outstanding international disputes.

It was in this situation that the Soviet Union made another major effort at this session of the General Assembly and put forward a new proposal. The new Soviet proposal is based on the suggestions made by Britain and France in the Disarmament Commission on June 11th of this year. The Soviet government took into account that although the British and French suggestions were not perfect, they had already recognized that it was necessary to begin to disarm and prohibit weapons of mass destruction, and no longer insisted on using the already bankrupt argument of investigating the armaments and armed forces of various countries to replace actual disarmament work. Therefore, it is consistent with the principles upheld by the Soviet Union on the issue of prohibiting weapons of mass destruction and disarmament to propose its own proposal by using the British and French suggestions as a basis and making some modifications.

The new Soviet proposal adopted the British and French suggestion on the phased reduction of conventional armaments and armed forces. The new Soviet proposal stipulates that disarmament and the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction will be achieved in two stages. In the first stage, countries will reduce armaments, armed forces, and military expenditures by 50 percent of the agreed-upon quotas. In the second stage, countries will reduce armaments, armed forces, and military expenditures by another 50 percent of the agreed-upon quotas, and completely prohibit weapons of mass destruction, completely eliminating these weapons from the armaments of all countries.

Over the years, the Soviet Union has consistently advocated that atomic weapons must be prohibited at the same time as conventional armaments are reduced, while Western countries have refused to do so, using this as an excuse to refuse to make serious reductions in conventional armaments. On this issue, the Soviet Union still believes that it is very important for countries to agree to undertake the obligation not to use weapons of mass destruction as a first step towards achieving the final and unconditional prohibition of these weapons and the complete elimination of these weapons from the armaments of all countries. However, the Soviet Union does not insist in its new proposal that such an agreement must be reached before measures to reduce conventional armaments are implemented, which removes the excuse for Western countries to refuse to reduce conventional armaments.

On the issue of international supervisory agencies, Western countries have insisted on establishing agencies before prohibiting atomic weapons, while the Soviet Union has advocated announcing the prohibition of atomic weapons at the same time as establishing agencies. In this regard, the new Soviet proposal also takes into account the views of Western countries. The Soviet proposal stipulates that in the first stage of disarmament, a temporary supervisory agency will be established at the same time as the implementation of measures such as the reduction of conventional armaments and armed forces. In the second stage, a permanent supervisory agency will be established at the same time as further reductions in conventional armaments and the complete prohibition of weapons of mass destruction.

On the issue of how to reduce conventional armaments and armed forces, the Soviet proposal stipulates that reductions will be carried out based on quotas agreed upon by all parties, and adopts the British and French suggestion that the amount of armaments and armed forces of each country on December 31, 1953, be used as the starting point for reductions.

The Soviet proposal also has obvious advantages that the British and French suggestions do not have: it not only stipulates the reduction of armaments and armed forces, but also stipulates the reduction of military expenditures; it clearly stipulates the date for reducing armaments and prohibiting weapons of mass destruction.

It is not difficult to see that the presentation of the new Soviet proposal is a conciliatory effort to eliminate major differences between the two sides, and is a major contribution to promoting the smooth resolution of the disarmament issue.

After the Soviet proposal was put forward, it was immediately widely welcomed and valued in the United Nations and in world opinion. In the discussions of the Political Committee of the General Assembly, representatives of many small and medium-sized countries spoke in praise of the Soviet Union's positive attitude, believing that this made the solution of the disarmament issue obtain "more favorable conditions than ever before," and demanded that the Western powers seriously consider the Soviet proposal. The Soviet suggestion has aroused great hope in world public opinion. The newspapers in Paris generally believed that the Soviet proposal was "a big step forward" on the disarmament issue. An editorial in "Liberation" demanded that the French Prime Minister abandon the road of arming West Germany and choose the road of disarmament negotiations. Newspapers in many countries also pointed out that the past excuses used by the United States to deceive the people of the world and shirk its responsibility for not wanting to disarm are no longer valid. In this way, the Soviet Union's peace policy merged with the peace aspirations of the people of the world, generating a huge moral force, which, as a reporter for the British "Observer" said, formed an "unstoppable tide of optimism." The eyes of people all over the world are closely watching the attitude of Western countries. The "Hindustan Standard" pointed out that the new Soviet proposal tests the sincerity of Western countries on the disarmament issue. In the face of this huge moral force, although representatives of some Western countries, led by the United States, deliberately emphasized differences and spread pessimism at the meeting, they had to acknowledge the positive role of the Soviet proposal, and finally put forward the five-nation proposal together with the Soviet Union.

Now, the General Assembly has adopted the five-nation joint proposal. The remaining differences in opinions between the two sides will be further resolved by the Disarmament Commission and its Subcommittee. However, it should also be noted that Western powers, especially the United States, are preparing to expand existing differences and continue to create difficulties for reaching an agreement. The United States is taking the lead in insisting on the claims in the "working documents" on the powers of the international supervisory agency that the United States has previously put forward, demanding that the power to sanction violations of international disarmament conventions, which should belong to the Security Council, be handed over to the international supervisory agency in violation of the provisions of the United Nations Charter. Outside the United Nations, American newspapers also make no secret of their hostility towards the Soviet proposal. Clark, the former commander-in-chief of the U.S. forces in the Far East, even openly said that all diplomatic proposals on the issue of atomic weapons and disarmament should not "hinder" the future actions of the U.S. government. Bevan, one of the leaders of the British Labour Party, recently gave a good explanation of this attitude of the United States in a conversation. He said: The nature of the American war economy hinders the work of disarmament.

In order to reach an international agreement on the issue of disarmament and the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction, and to turn the possibility created by the Soviet Union's proactive efforts at this session of the United Nations General Assembly into reality, it is necessary to defeat the U.S. ruling clique's continued implementation of the policy of preparing for atomic war and expanding armaments, and it is necessary to defeat the evil intentions and obstruction of this small group of people in mankind. This is the direction in which all peace-loving people must strive at present.

    为裁减军备和禁止大规模毁灭性武器而努力
    李延寗
    联合国大会全体会议已经在十一月四日一致通过了加拿大、法国、苏联、美国、英国五国关于裁军问题的联合提案。苏联和西方国家在这一重要问题上的观点现在大大接近了，多年来陷于僵持局面的裁减军备和禁止大规模毁灭性武器问题已由此获得了进展的可能。这是苏联进行建设性努力的结果。如果西方国家真正具有诚意，认真地共同努力，那末在这一问题上达成最后协议是十分可能的。
    五国联合提案规定责成联合国裁军委员会及其小组委员会（由加、法、苏、美、英五国组成）继续进行研究，寻求一个大家可以接受的解决办法，以达成缔结国际裁军公约的协议。这个提案并且肯定了：裁军委员会及其小组委员会在进行这一工作时应当以裁军委员会的报告书和苏联今年九月三十日在联合国大会提出的提案为基础。五国提案是自从一九四六年以来四大国在联合国中第一次对这样重大的问题采取的一致行动。苏联代表团团长维辛斯基曾指出，这个提案虽然是五国在程序问题上的协议，它的意义却远超过程序的性质，这个提案实际上是裁军委员会及其小组委员会进行工作的某种纲领。维辛斯基还指出，五国共同提出这个提案表明了：它们认为将来共同努力以期求得最后成功是可能的。维辛斯基的这些估计正确地指明了五国提案的重大政治意义。这一结果对于解决裁军问题本身以及对于进一步促进国际紧张局势的缓和，都将有很大的作用。
    大家知道，自从联合国大会第一届会议在苏联的创议下通过决议，肯定了应当禁止原子武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器以及普遍裁减军备的原则以来，已经过了九年了。九年来苏联一贯为争取禁止大规模毁灭性武器和大量裁减军备的实现而积极努力。在联合国大会每届会议上，苏联都提出了解决这一问题的提案。但是，美国统治集团始终奉行着扩军备战的政策，企图用调查各国军备和军队等办法，来阻挠真正实行裁减军备和禁止大规模毁灭性武器。英、法以及其他一些西方国家也追随美国的这种立场。因此，年复一年，在联合国中进行着讨论，然而问题始终悬而未决，双方观点之间的分歧仍然很大。
    但是，裁减军备和禁止大规模毁灭性武器问题是关系到各国人民的和平和安全的重大问题；由于西方国家扩充军备给资本主义国家人民带来了越来越难以忍受的沉重负担，由于原子武器和氢武器的发展，特别是由于美国的好战分子正在竭力鼓吹新战争并且实际上执行着把大规模毁灭性武器作为美国军事政策的基石的方针，全世界人民要求裁减军备和消除原子战争威胁的呼声是越来越高涨了。因此，各国在这个问题上求得达成谅解是更为迫切了。
    在联合国大会本届会议召开以前的期间，出现了特别有利的气氛。国际紧张局势有了某种程度的缓和，赞成不同社会制度的国家和平共处的人越来越多。日内瓦会议的结果证明，甚至在十分困难的争执问题上也是可能通过协商解决的。很显然，在这种有利的气氛下，如果在裁军问题上能够打开僵局，将不仅对问题本身的解决有着直接的关系，而且对于进一步缓和国际局势、改善各国之间的关系和解决其他悬而未决的国际争端，都必将产生有利的影响。
    正是在这种形势之下，苏联在联大本届会议上作出了又一次的重大努力，提出了新的提案。苏联新提案是以英法两国今年六月十一日在裁军委员会提出的建议为基础的。苏联政府考虑到，英、法建议虽然并不完备，但是这个建议已经承认必须着手来裁减军备和禁止大规模毁灭性武器，而没有再坚持用调查各国军备和武装部队情况来代替实际裁军工作的早已破产了的主张。因此，如果把英、法建议作为基础，加以某些修改，来提出自己的提案，这是同苏联在禁止大规模毁灭性武器和裁减军备问题上所坚持的原则相符合的。
    苏联新提案中采纳了英、法建议中关于分阶段裁减常规军备和武装部队的主张。苏联的新提案规定分两个阶段来实现裁减军备和禁止大规模毁灭性武器。在第一阶段内各国把军备、武装部队和军费削减一致同意的定额的百分之五十。在第二阶段内，各国把军备、武装部队和军费再削减一致同意的定额的百分之五十，并完全禁止大规模毁灭性武器，从各国军备中完全取消这些武器。
    历年来，苏联一向主张必须在裁减常规军备的同时禁止原子武器，而西方国家则拒绝这样做，并以此为借口拒绝对常规军备作认真的裁减。在这个问题上，苏联目前仍然认为：各国协议承担不使用大规模毁灭性武器的义务，以作为实现最后无条件禁止这些武器、从各国军备中完全取消这些武器的第一个步骤，是十分重要的。但是，苏联在其新提案中并不坚持必须先达成这种协议，然后再实行裁减常规军备的措施，这就解除了西方国家拒绝裁减常规军备的借口。
    在国际监督机构的问题上，过去西方国家坚持先建立机构、再禁止原子武器，苏联则主张在建立机构的同时应宣布禁止原子武器。在这方面，苏联新提案也照顾了西方国家的意见。苏联提案规定：在裁军的第一阶段中，同实施裁减常规军备和武装部队等措施同时，建立临时性监督机构。在第二阶段中，在进一步裁减常规军备和完全禁止大规模毁灭性武器的同时，建立永久性监督机构。
    在如何裁减常规军备和武装部队的问题上，苏联提案规定根据大家一致同意的定额来进行裁减，并采纳了英、法建议所主张的以各国一九五三年十二月三十一日的军备和武装部队的数量作为裁减的起算点。
    苏联提案还有英、法建议所没有的明显的优点：不仅规定裁减军备和武装部队，而且规定裁减军费；明确规定了裁减军备和禁止大规模毁灭性武器的日期。
    不难看出，苏联新提案的提出是力求消除双方重大分歧的和解性的努力，对于促进顺利解决裁军问题是一个重大贡献。
    苏联提案提出以后，立刻在联合国内和世界舆论中受到普遍的欢迎和重视。在联大政治委员会的讨论中，许多中小国家的代表发言赞扬苏联的积极态度，认为这使裁军问题的解决获得了“比以往任何时候有利的条件”，并要求西方大国认真考虑苏联提案。苏联建议在世界广大舆论中更是引起了巨大的希望。巴黎各报普遍认为苏联提案是在裁军问题上“前进了一大步”。“解放报”社论要求法国总理放弃武装西德的道路，选择进行裁军谈判的道路。不少国家的报纸还指出，过去美国蒙蔽世界人民并推卸不愿裁军的责任的借口已经不能成立了。就是这样，苏联的和平政策同全世界人民的和平愿望汇合在一起，产生了巨大的道义力量，正如英国“观察家报”记者所说的，形成了一个“势不可挡的乐观潮流”。全世界人民的眼睛密切注视着西方国家的态度。“印度斯坦旗报”指出，苏联新提案考验着西方国家在裁军问题上的诚意。在这种巨大的道义力量面前，以美国为首的某些西方国家的代表虽然在会议上故意强调分歧，散布悲观论调，但是它们不得不承认苏联提案的积极作用，并终于和苏联一道提出了五国提案。
    现在，联大全体会议已经通过了五国联合提案。双方意见中尚存的分歧将由裁军委员会及其小组委员会进一步求得解决。但是，人们也应该注意到，西方大国、特别是美国正准备扩大现存的分歧，继续为达成协议制造困难。美国正在带头坚持美国以前提出的关于国际监督机构职权的“工作文件”中的主张，要求违反联合国宪章的规定，把应当属于安全理事会的制裁违反国际裁军公约事件的权力交给国际监督机构。在联合国之外，美国报纸也毫不掩饰它们对苏联提案的敌视态度。前远东美军总司令克拉克甚至公然说：关于原子武器和裁军问题的一切外交上的方案，都应当不“妨碍”美国政府今后的行动。对于美国的这种态度，英国工党负责人之一比万最近在一次谈话中作了很好的解释。他说：美国战争经济的性质障碍着裁减军备工作。
    为了使裁减军备和禁止大规模毁灭性武器问题能够达成国际协议，使苏联在联合国大会本届会议上的主动努力所造成的可能性变为现实，就必须击败美国统治集团继续推行准备原子战争和扩充军备的政策，就必须击败人类中这一小撮人的罪恶打算和阻挠行为。这就是一切爱好和平的人们目前必须努力的方向。
