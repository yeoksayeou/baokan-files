    Huaiyin Special District Actively Prevents Swine Fever
    The Huaiyin Special District of Jiangsu Province is actively carrying out autumn swine fever prevention and inoculation work. According to preliminary statistics, more than 126,000 pigs have been inoculated by the end of October. The Huaiyin District is one of the main pig-producing areas in Jiangsu Province, but in the past, swine fever caused great damage to pig production. This autumn, the Huaiyin Special Office has formulated specific measures for the prevention and control of swine fever. The whole district plans to carry out free swine fever prevention inoculations for 200,000 pigs in order to control the spread of swine fever and support farmers in vigorously developing pig production. As early as September, the special district trained 300 traditional Chinese veterinarians to teach epidemic prevention techniques. All seven counties in the district have established epidemic prevention teams of 30 to 200 people, closely integrating with the central work of autumn plowing and planting, and carrying out work based on state-owned farms, ranches, and agricultural production cooperatives. The work also combined the treatment of sick pigs and the promotion of improved feeding management and environmental hygiene. Therefore, the epidemic prevention work has been warmly welcomed by the masses, and the masses' confidence in pig raising has also been enhanced. (Zhu Weiqing)

    淮阴专区积极预防猪瘟
    江苏省淮阴专区积极开展秋季猪瘟预防注射工作，据初步统计至十月底止已注射毛猪十二万六千余头。淮阴区是江苏省主要产猪区之一，但过去因猪瘟危害，使毛猪生产大受影响。今年秋季淮阴专署特作出防治猪瘟的具体措施，全区计划进行免费猪瘟预防注射二十万头，以控制猪瘟蔓延，支持农民大力发展毛猪生产。专区早在九月份即训练了三百名中兽医，传授防疫技术。全区七个县都成立了三十至二百人的防疫大队，密切结合秋耕秋种等中心工作，以国营农、牧场及农业生产合作社为基点开展工作，工作中还结合治疗病猪，宣传改善饲养管理、环境卫生等，因此防疫工作得到群众热烈欢迎，群众养猪的信心也提高了。　　　（朱维清）
