    A Short Journey
    —Naval Life Correspondence Three
    By our reporter Chen Yongjin
    People who have never been on a warship find it difficult to understand the arduous and complex work of naval officers. The task of naval officers and soldiers is to defend the motherland on irregular routes, even in the most treacherous weather. No matter how long our country's coastline is, and no matter how tortuous and complex it is, naval comrades cannot fulfill the mission given by the country if they do not find ways to become familiar with it. Take navigation, for example, there is daytime and nighttime navigation, and there is also navigation on desolate days without moonlight or stars. There are many clouds, fogs, and storms at sea, but no matter what kind of clouds, fogs, or storms, as long as there is enemy activity, they must sail out to meet the enemy. When sailing, they have to bypass all the reefs, know the speed of their warship, and also know the speed of the ocean current and the wind. At night, when they cannot see the lighthouses, they have to know the position of their warship from the position of the moon and certain stars, otherwise they may hit a reef. Accurately knowing the position of a warship in that vast ocean is difficult to imagine, but they must know it. A modern warship must have highly scientific instruments, and the important thing is to learn how to master these instruments in order to carry out a victorious battle.
    I lived on the warship for ten days or so. Observing on the foredeck and aftdeck, on the command platform or in the engine room, made me deeply feel that learning to master these scientific technologies is not an easy task. Those who have been on our warship will not only admire the bravery of our naval officers and soldiers but will also admire their perseverance in learning their profession.
    Only a few years, many comrades who transferred to the navy from the army, with their low levels of education, have been able to become familiar with and master their warships. Let me tell you about the short journey of a naval commander!
    When I first arrived at the fleet, the enthusiastic deputy director of the political department said to me: "Do you want to understand the situation of our new China's naval construction?" He pointed to a burly young man next to me and said, "If you want to understand our commanders, the experience of Comrade Feng Shangxian next to you can explain the growth of our naval officers."
    The dark-faced young man said somewhat shyly at the time: "I can't, I am an ordinary person, and ordinary people cannot be introduced in the newspaper."
    The deputy director of the political department added: "If you want to understand our sailors," he pointed to the sea where the warship was docked and said, "They are on every warship."
    I had several conversations with Feng Shangxian. He transferred to the navy from the army in July 1949. When Feng Shangxian received the order to go to the navy, he hesitated for a brief moment. Because he had not only never been on a warship before, but he had never even been on a merchant ship. Naturally, working in the navy was not as comfortable as working in the army. At that time, the more he thought about it, the more he missed the joy of army life. From the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan to the complete liberation of the mainland, he had never left the land. In the short time after he received the order, he fought off the hesitant thoughts of whether or not to go to the navy. He thought that the motherland needed to build a strong navy, and the more he thought about it, the more urgent he felt about going to the navy. He made up his mind to resolutely carry out the order and learn to be a good naval soldier.
    When a Communist Party member completely forgets personal interests and thinks for the interests of the Party, he will bravely overcome all difficulties and quickly achieve the Party's requirements.
    Feng Shangxian went to the navy. However, his first step towards the navy did not step on the deck of a warship, but into the naval school. He did leadership work in the naval school, taught political classes, and also performed general administrative work. These already occupied all his daytime hours, and even the daytime was not enough. But Feng Shangxian resolutely implemented the Party's call to quickly learn naval skills. At first, he only worked hard to learn general knowledge of the navy. Three months later, he was transferred to a warship as a captain. His most practical learning began at this time.
    After Feng Shangxian arrived on the warship, he asked a comrade with more navigation experience: "How long does it take to learn navigation?"
    That comrade shook his head, and when Feng Shangxian asked again, he said impatiently: "That's not an easy task. It would be good to learn it in eight or ten years!"
    Feng Shangxian also found the old navigator Huang Haichen, but Huang Haichen encouraged him and said, "There's nothing great about it. As long as you work hard, you will learn quickly." Feng Shangxian sometimes ran to the old navigator's station, stood next to him for a long time, and watched how he worked. When he was free, Feng Shangxian asked in detail what this thing was, what that thing was, and the principles related to navigation. Feng Shangxian's spirit of learning humbly moved the old navigator, and the old navigator's awareness also improved. He said: "I will definitely tell the new comrades everything that I have in my stomach."
    Feng Shangxian told me several times that you can't pretend to understand when you don't understand. This is Feng Shangxian's correct attitude to be able to learn naval skills well.
    To learn naval skills, you must learn navigation. Navigation is divided into celestial navigation and terrestrial navigation, but regardless of which type of navigation, you must understand mathematics; otherwise, it is impossible to master navigation. The little mathematics that Feng Shangxian learned when he was a child was almost forgotten during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation. Now he had to start from scratch. Sometimes, in order to understand a math problem, he often worked until midnight, or waited for hot meals to turn cold. Feng Shangxian is now able to calculate the position of his warship based on the stars or the moon in the vast sea, and he calculates it very accurately.
    I learned from Feng Shangxian and other sailors that our naval officers and soldiers have carried forward the revolutionary tradition of hard struggle of the People's Liberation Army. When Feng Shangxian came to the warship, like many sailors, he often got seasick. In order not to get seasick, he hummed songs, or chewed some pickles to calm his body and mind. Feng Shangxian and his wife have a very good relationship, but after he transferred to the navy from the army, he rarely went ashore even on Sundays. His wife once suspected that he was becoming distant from her, but in reality, he put all his energy into work and study. When he was studying astronomy, in order to study the rising and setting of a star, he often sat from dark to dawn. The dew wetted his single clothes, and the cold wind pierced his cotton clothes, but it could not interrupt his research. In the summer, when the sun radiated heat on the sea, this strong young man often ran to the top of the mountain at noon to study the sun's movement and measure the distance between the sun and him. This is how Feng Shangxian diligently learned celestial navigation and terrestrial navigation. In the past few years, he has commanded more than 10,000 nautical miles of navigation. In that distant 10,000 nautical miles of navigation, he was victorious.
    During my days on the warship, the impression that the sailors and commanders gave me was so profound and vivid. They are earnestly following Chairman Mao's instructions—in order to oppose the invasion of any imperialists, we must strive to build a strong navy, training day and night in the waves.

    短短的历程
    ——海军生活通讯之三
    本报记者　陈勇进
    没有到过军舰上的人，很难理解海军干部的艰巨而复杂的工作。海军指战员的任务是在没有规律的航线上，即令是最险恶的天气里，执行捍卫祖国的任务。不管我们国家的海岸线有多么长，也不管我们的海岸线有多么曲折和复杂，海军同志如果不设法熟悉这些，就不可能完成国家给予的使命。就说航海吧，有白天和夜晚航海，也有没月亮和星辰的荒天航海。海上的云雾和风暴特别多，但不管什么样的云雾和风暴，只要有了敌情，就要出航迎敌。航海时他们要绕过一切暗礁，要知道自己军舰的行速，还要知道海水的流速和风速。在夜间看不到灯塔的时候，他们要从月亮和某些星辰的位置上知道自己军舰的位置，否则就可能碰上暗礁。在那汪洋大海里要准确地知道一个军舰的位置，困难是可以想像的，但他们又一定要知道。一艘现代化的军舰，一定有高度科学的仪器，重要的是要学会掌握这些仪器，才能进行胜利的战斗。
    我在军舰上住了十来天，在前甲板和后甲板，在指挥台或轮机部的观察，都使我深深地感到学习掌握这些科学技术，并不是件容易的事。到过我们军舰上的，不仅会敬佩我们海军指战员的勇敢，同样会敬佩他们学习业务的坚忍不拔的精神。
    只有几年呀，许多从陆军转到海军的同志，在自己文化水平较低的情况下，已经能够熟悉掌握自己的军舰。让我告诉大家一个海军指挥员的短短的历程吧！
    还是我刚到舰队的时候，那个热情的政治部副主任就向我说：“你要了解我们新中国的海军建设情形吗？”他指着我旁边的一个身体魁梧的青年说：“你要了解我们的指挥员，在你旁边的冯尚贤同志的经历就可以说明我们海军干部的成长。”
    那个面孔黑黑的青年，当时有些不好意思地说：“我不行，我是个平常人，平常人是不能拿到报纸上去介绍的。”
    政治部副主任又说：“你如果要了解我们的水兵，”他又向停泊军舰的海面上指了指说：“哪个军舰上都有。”
    我曾和冯尚贤作了好几次的谈话。他是一九四九年的七月从陆军里转到海军的。冯尚贤接到去海军的命令时，心里曾犹豫了一个短短的时刻。因为他过去不但没有到过军舰上，就是连商船也没坐过。自然到海军里工作没有在陆军里习惯。那时，他越想越觉得陆军生活的快乐。他从抗日战争的初期到大陆的全部解放，从来没有离开过陆地。就在他接到命令的短时间里，他击退了到不到海军去的犹豫思想。他想到祖国需要建设一支强大的海军，他愈想愈加感到到海军去的迫切。他下定了决心，坚决执行命令，学作一个好的海军军人。
    一个共产党员，当他完全忘掉个人利益而为党的利益着想的时候，他会无限勇敢地排除一切困难，迅速地达到党的要求。
    冯尚贤到海军里去了。可是在他走向海军的第一步，并没有踏到军舰的甲板上，而是走进了海军学校。他在海军学校里做了领导工作，教授政治课，同时担任一般的行政工作。这些已占据了他白天的全部时间，甚至白天还不够。但冯尚贤坚决执行党的迅速学好海军业务的号召。起初，只是努力学习海军的普通常识，三个月后，他被调到军舰上做舰长。他的最实际的学习是从这时开始的。
    冯尚贤到军舰上后，问一个比较有航海经验的同志：“学航海需要多长时间？”
    那个同志摇了摇头，等冯尚贤再问的时候，就不耐烦地说：“那可不是件容易的事，十年八年学会了也就不错啦！”
    冯尚贤又找到老航海员黄海琛，黄海琛却鼓励他说：“没有什么了不起，只要努力，会很快学会的。”冯尚贤有时跑到这位老航海员的站位上，在他旁边站好久，看他怎样工作。等他有空了，冯尚贤才详细地问这东西是什么，那东西是什么，以及有关航海的原理。冯尚贤虚心学习的精神，感动了这位老航海员，老航海员的觉悟也提高了。他说：“只要我肚子里有的东西，一定都告诉新来的同志。”
    冯尚贤几次跟我说，不懂可不能装懂。这就是冯尚贤能够学好海军业务的正确态度。
    学海军业务，就要学航海。航海又分天文航海，地文航海，可是不论那种航海都要懂得数学；否则，要掌握航海是不可能的。冯尚贤小时候学的一点数学，在抗日战争和解放战争中都快忘掉了。现在要从头学起，有时他为了搞通一个数学题，常常搞到半夜，或者把热饭等成了凉饭。冯尚贤现在能在茫茫的大海里，根据星星或月亮计算出自己军舰的位置，并且计算得很准确。
    我从冯尚贤及其他水兵的口里了解到，我们海军的指战员们发扬了人民解放军艰苦奋斗的革命传统。冯尚贤在来到军舰的时候，和很多水兵一样，经常晕船。为了不晕船，他就哼哼着唱歌，或者口里嚼点咸菜，使自己的身心镇静下来。冯尚贤和他爱人感情很好，但他从陆军转到海军之后，就是在星期天也很少下舰。他爱人曾经怀疑他和她疏远了，实际上是他把全部精力都用到工作和学习上去了。他学习天文的时候，为了研究一个星星的升起和降落，往往从天黑坐到天明。露水把他的单衣打湿了，寒风把他的棉衣刺透了，都不能中断了他的研究。夏天，太阳在海上发射热力的时候，这个健壮的青年人，为了研究太阳的运行和测量太阳离他的距离，往往在中午跑到山头上去。冯尚贤就是这样勤勉地学会了天文航海和地文航海。这几年来，他指挥了一万多浬的航行，在那遥远的一万多浬的航行中，他胜利了。
    我在军舰上的日子，水兵及指挥员给我的印象是那样深刻而鲜明，他们正切实地按着毛主席的指示——为了反对任何帝国主义者的侵略，我们一定要为建立一个强大的海军而奋斗着，日日夜夜地在波涛里锻炼着。
