    How the CCP Dali County Committee Shifted the Focus of its Leadership to the Mutual Aid and Cooperation Movement
    The Weinan District Committee of the CCP

    The CCP Dali County Committee in Shaanxi Province has consistently paid relatively close attention to the work of developing mutual aid and cooperation. Particularly after publicizing the general line to farmers and implementing the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain in rural areas, the County Committee gradually shifted its leadership focus to the mutual aid and cooperation movement. By July of this year, the number of organized farming households in the county accounted for 65.9 percent of the total number of farming households, an increase of 8.9 percent compared to 1953. Last spring, there was only one agricultural production cooperative in Huangpu Village in the entire county. By the end of August this year, it had increased to nineteen, with a total of 1,076 participating farming households, accounting for 3.56 percent of the total number of farming households. Based on the development of mutual aid and cooperation, farming techniques have also been improved, creating favorable conditions for increased agricultural production. Farmers' socialist consciousness and patriotism have also been raised accordingly. During the summer grain requisition work, they were generally able to consciously respond to the call. At present, the enthusiasm of the masses for mutual aid and cooperation is very high. According to preliminary surveys, 124 mutual aid teams are actively requesting to establish cooperatives. Each district has selected eleven villages as training targets for the next phase of cooperative establishment. It is estimated that two to three townships will achieve basic cooperation this winter and next spring.

    The Dali County Committee has the following experiences in shifting the focus of its leadership to mutual aid and cooperation:

    1. The County Committee Secretary personally takes action, and the County Committee frequently conducts in-depth research and inspection of problems in the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and promptly summarizes and disseminates experience. Since this spring, the County Committee has held a total of eight County Committee meetings to discuss mutual aid and cooperation issues. The County Committee Secretary personally leads this work and frequently goes to the countryside for inspection. During the spring plowing, the County Committee Secretary went to the countryside for inspection twice, and promptly corrected the deviations of seriously neglecting production and failing to fully mobilize the masses in the establishment of cooperatives. Other County Committee members also went deep into cooperatives and teams to conduct specific inspections and guidance, and reported the results of each inspection to the County Committee. Based on the problems and new experiences found in the inspection, the County Committee promptly instructed the work below, making the ideological thinking of district and township leaders clear and followed. The County Committee also held two representative meetings on mutual aid and cooperation in a planned and prepared manner, one to summarize spring plowing and arrange summer harvesting, and the other to summarize summer harvesting work and discuss how to do a good job in summer production on the basis of promoting mutual aid and cooperation. In the establishment of cooperatives, the County Committee used the method of apprenticeship to train district committee secretaries, district committee members, and branch secretaries to learn how to run cooperatives, preparing a foundation for district committees to run cooperatives.

    2. Various departments cooperate to carry out business work in coordination with mutual aid and cooperation. The County Committee pays attention to unifying everyone's thinking through various meetings, so that various departments gradually clarify that they should cooperate with the mutual aid and cooperation movement to carry out their own business, and constantly study how business work can serve this central task. The Organization Department of the County Committee summarized the experience of the Bayu Township Branch in leading agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation to educate other branches. The Propaganda Department of the County Committee summarized the experience of the "May Fourth" Agricultural Production Cooperative in propaganda and education during the establishment of the cooperative and several issues in the political and ideological work of the Ma Yanhai Agricultural Production Cooperative, and organized the technical station to compile small propaganda materials such as cotton insect prevention and wheat seed selection, and distributed them to various places. The Youth League mobilized young people to actively participate in mutual aid and cooperative organizations, organized young people to sign contracts with technical stations, and learned advanced farming techniques and high-yield experience. These works have played a certain role in the development of mutual aid and cooperation.

    3. The County Committee pays attention to improving the level of leadership of district and township cadres and giving play to the role of Party organizations at all levels. This spring, the County Committee convened two joint meetings of district committee secretaries and township branch secretaries, and held a training class for township branch secretaries, specializing in studying how branches should lead mutual aid and cooperation. Now, district committees in various districts have explored some methods in leading mutual aid and cooperation. Generally, district committees are divided into townships by district committee members, leading mutual aid and cooperation through branches, and reporting to the district committee regularly. The district committee regularly discusses the main problems in current mutual aid and cooperation. In addition, the district committee regularly convenes joint meetings of township branch secretaries to study branch work and specifically help branches arrange various tasks with mutual aid and cooperation as the center. At present, the branch committees of stronger branches have been able to play a leading core role in the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and general branches can also make resolutions based on the instructions of the district committee and the problems in mutual aid and cooperation, educating Party members to take the lead and mobilizing the masses to complete them. Under the leadership of the branch committee, each township holds a representative meeting on mutual aid and cooperation once a month to exchange experiences and solve current problems.

    4. In the process of carrying out the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the County Committee pays attention to grasping the current key to increasing production. In the past, wheat yields in Dali County were not high. In addition to poor soil conditions, the main reason was sparse planting, coupled with the serious phenomenon of missing seedlings and broken rows, which affected the increase in yield. However, wheat yields were very high in areas with a good foundation for mutual aid and cooperation. For example, in 1953, the average wheat yield per mu in Dali was 173 jin, while the average yield per mu in the Huangpu Village Agricultural Production Cooperative was 247 jin. The reason why the wheat yield of the Huangpu Village Agricultural Production Cooperative was so high was because they improved all the drills last year, implemented close planting, and selected good varieties. The County Committee Secretary went deep into the village to study the issue of selecting good varieties and rational close planting. The County Committee used these specific facts to educate farmers by calculating detailed accounts and making comparisons, improving wheat drills, and narrowing row spacing. After the County Committee initially promoted this advanced experience, the average wheat yield per mu this year reached 198 jin, an increase of 25 jin per mu compared to last year. This not only convinced the masses to adopt new farming techniques, but also promoted the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement.

    5. In the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the County Committee cultivated key points and adopted various methods to promote the experience of key points. Organizing observation is a good way to promote the experience of key districts and villages. Since the spring plowing, various districts have organized observation two or three times. In Bayu Village, the Fourth District, the masses had many concerns in the establishment of the cooperative. The Party organization organized everyone to visit the autumn crops of the Huangpu Village Agricultural Production Cooperative. The visitors all said: "The crops of the cooperative are good, and it is right to join the cooperative." In addition, in the process of promoting key experiences, the County Committee also paid attention to discovering new creations among the masses, summarizing and implementing them.

    The Dali County Committee also has some problems in leading mutual aid and cooperation that need to be improved: the principle of collective leadership is not implemented enough. The County Committee has not systematically organized County Committee members to study the theoretical policies related to mutual aid and cooperation, and to systematically absorb experience by taking turns going deep into teams and cooperatives to improve the leadership level of County Committee members. Although the County Committee grasped the center when uniformly deploying work, it did not put forward specific requirements for the work of some departments.

    The County Committee's understanding of the importance of establishing and improving the cooperative network is insufficient. Last year, the county established a cooperative network centered on Huangpu Village, but due to the lack of clear understanding at the time, this matter was also rejected as a "five-too-many" phenomenon. With the continued development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the strength of cadres is even more insufficient, and it is very appropriate to strengthen leadership through the form of a mutual aid and cooperation network. Although the County Committee has paid attention to the education work of rural branches, 48 percent of the branches still cannot play any role in the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Very few rural Party members were developed in the first half of this year, and three districts did not develop a single Party member, which is not conducive to the great development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. In the future, it is necessary to actively and prudently develop Party members in the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and strengthen the leadership of rural branch work.

    中共大荔县委是怎样把领导重心转向互助合作运动的
    中共渭南地委会
    中共陕西省大荔县委一贯对发展互助合作的工作比较重视，特别在向农民宣传了总路线和在农村实行了粮食统购统销政策以后，县委便把领导重心逐渐转向互助合作运动。到今年七月为止，全县组织起来的农户占总农户的百分之六十五点九，比一九五三年增加了百分之八点九。去春，全县只黄甫村有一个农业生产合作社，到今年八月底已增加到十九个，参加农户共一千零七十六户，占总农户的百分之三点五六。在互助合作发展基础上耕作技术也有了改进，给农业增产创造了有利条件。农民的社会主义觉悟和爱国主义思想也随着提高了，夏季粮食征购工作中，一般都能自觉响应号召。目前，群众互助合作的积极性很高，据初步调查，已有一百二十四个互助组积极要求建社，各区已选择了十一个村作为下期建社培养对象，预计今冬明春将有二至三个乡达到基本合作化。
    大荔县委在把领导重心转向互助合作方面有以下几点经验。
    一、县委书记亲自动手，县委经常深入研究检查互助合作运动中的问题，及时总结和传播经验。今春以来，县委共召开了八次讨论互助合作问题的县委会议。县委书记亲自领导这项工作，并经常下乡检查。春耕中县委书记曾下乡检查了两次，及时纠正了建社中的严重忽视生产和没有全面发动群众的偏向。其他县委委员也深入社、组具体检查指导，并将每次检查结果，向县委会作汇报。县委根据检查中发现的问题和新的经验，及时指示下面的工作，使区、乡领导思想明确并有所遵循。县委还有计划有准备地召开了互助合作代表会两次，一次是总结春耕，安排夏收做活先后和计工算账问题；另一次是总结夏收工作，讨论如何在搞好互助合作的基础上做好夏季生产。县委在建社中，用带徒弟的办法，训练区委书记、区委委员、支部书记等学习办社，为区委办社准备了基础。
    二、各个部门配合互助合作开展业务工作。县委注意通过各种会议统一大家的思想，使各部门逐步明确应该配合互助合作运动，开展自己的业务，并不断研究业务工作如何为这一中心服务。县委组织部曾总结了八鱼乡支部领导农业生产互助合作的经验，教育其他支部。县委宣传部曾总结“五四”农业生产合作社在建社中的宣传教育工作经验和马延海农业生产合作社政治思想工作的几个问题，并组织技术站编写棉花防虫和小麦选种等小型宣传材料，印发各地。青年团发动青年积极参加互助合作组织，组织青年同技术站订立合同，学习先进耕作技术和丰产经验等。这些工作对互助合作的发展起了一定的作用。
    三、县委注意提高区、乡领导干部水平，发挥各级党组织的作用。今春县委召开过两次区委书记、乡支部书记联席会议，并举办了乡支部书记训练班，专门研究支部如何领导互助合作的问题。现在，各区区委会在领导互助合作方面已经摸索到一些办法。一般区委都是由区委委员分乡包干，通过支部领导互助合作，定期向区委会作汇报，区委定期讨论当前互助合作中的主要问题。此外，区委还定期召开乡支部书记联席会议，研究支部工作，具体帮助支部以互助合作为中心安排各项工作。目前，较强的支部的支委会在互助合作运动中已能发挥领导核心作用，一般的支部也能根据区委的指示和互助合作中的问题作出决议，教育党员带头，发动群众完成。在支委会领导下，各乡每月召开一次互助合作代表会议，交流经验，解决当前问题。
    四、在开展互助合作运动的过程中，县委注意抓住当前增产关键。大荔县过去小麦产量不高，除土质条件较差外，主要由于稀植，加上缺苗断条现象严重，因而影响到产量的增加。但互助合作基础较好的地区，麦子产量却很高。如一九五三年大荔小麦平均每亩产一百七十三斤，而黄甫村农业生产合作社平均每亩产二百四十七斤。黄甫村农业生产合作社的小麦产量所以高，是因为他们去年全部改良了耧，实行了密植并选用了良种。县委书记深入到村里研究了选用良种、合理密植的问题。县委就拿这些具体事实采用算细账对比的方法教育农民，改良麦耧，缩小行距。县委初步推广了这个先进经验后，今年小麦每亩产量平均达到一百九十八斤，每亩比去年增加二十五斤。这就不但说服群众采用新的耕作技术，并且推动了互助合作运动的发展。
    五、在互助合作运动中，县委培养了重点，并采用各种办法去推广重点的经验。组织观摩是推广重点区、村的经验的一个很好的方法。春耕以来，各区先后组织观摩两三次。四区八鱼村在建社中，群众顾虑较多。党组织便组织大家参观黄甫村农业生产合作社的秋季作物。参观的人都说：“社的庄稼就是好，参加社没错。”此外，在推广重点经验的过程中，县委还注意发现群众中的新创造，加以总结推行。
    大荔县委在领导互助合作方面也还存在着一些需要改进的问题：集体领导原则贯彻不够。县委没有有计划地组织县委委员们学习有关互助合作的理论政策，并轮流深入组、社较系统地吸取经验，以提高县委委员的领导水平。县委在统一布置工作时虽抓住了中心，但对有些部门的工作没有提出具体要求。
    县委对建立和健全合作网的重要意义认识不足。去年该县曾以黄甫村为中心建立合作网，但由于当时认识不明确，把这件事情也当作“五多”现象反掉了。随着互助合作运动的继续发展，干部力量更加不足，通过互助合作网的形式加强领导，是很适当的。县委对农村支部教育工作虽已引起重视，但至今尚有百分之四十八的支部在互助合作运动中不能起什么作用。今年上半年农村党员发展很少，有三个区一个党员也没有发展，这对互助合作运动的大发展很不适应。今后必须在互助合作运动中积极而又慎重地发展党员，并加强对农村支部工作的领导。
