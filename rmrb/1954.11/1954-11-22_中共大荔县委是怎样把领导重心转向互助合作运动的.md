    How the CCP Dali County Committee Shifted the Focus of its Leadership to the Mutual Aid and Cooperation Movement
    The Weinan District Committee of the CCP

    The CCP Dali County Committee in Shaanxi Province has consistently paid relatively close attention to the work of developing mutual aid and cooperation. Particularly after publicizing the general line to farmers and implementing the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain in rural areas, the County Committee gradually shifted its leadership focus to the mutual aid and cooperation movement. By July of this year, the number of organized farming households in the county accounted for 65.9 percent of the total number of farming households, an increase of 8.9 percent compared to 1953. Last spring, there was only one agricultural production cooperative in Huangpu Village in the entire county. By the end of August this year, it had increased to nineteen, with a total of 1,076 participating farming households, accounting for 3.56 percent of the total number of farming households. Based on the development of mutual aid and cooperation, farming techniques have also been improved, creating favorable conditions for increased agricultural production. Farmers' socialist consciousness and patriotism have also been raised accordingly. During the summer grain requisition work, they were generally able to consciously respond to the call. At present, the enthusiasm of the masses for mutual aid and cooperation is very high. According to preliminary surveys, 124 mutual aid teams are actively requesting to establish cooperatives. Each district has selected eleven villages as training targets for the next phase of cooperative establishment. It is estimated that two to three townships will achieve basic cooperation this winter and next spring.

    The Dali County Committee has the following experiences in shifting the focus of its leadership to mutual aid and cooperation:

    1. The County Committee Secretary personally takes action, and the County Committee frequently conducts in-depth research and inspection of problems in the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and promptly summarizes and disseminates experience. Since this spring, the County Committee has held a total of eight County Committee meetings to discuss mutual aid and cooperation issues. The County Committee Secretary personally leads this work and frequently goes to the countryside for inspection. During the spring plowing, the County Committee Secretary went to the countryside for inspection twice, and promptly corrected the deviations of seriously neglecting production and failing to fully mobilize the masses in the establishment of cooperatives. Other County Committee members also went deep into cooperatives and teams to conduct specific inspections and guidance, and reported the results of each inspection to the County Committee. Based on the problems and new experiences found in the inspection, the County Committee promptly instructed the work below, making the ideological thinking of district and township leaders clear and followed. The County Committee also held two representative meetings on mutual aid and cooperation in a planned and prepared manner, one to summarize spring plowing and arrange summer harvesting, and the other to summarize summer harvesting work and discuss how to do a good job in summer production on the basis of promoting mutual aid and cooperation. In the establishment of cooperatives, the County Committee used the method of apprenticeship to train district committee secretaries, district committee members, and branch secretaries to learn how to run cooperatives, preparing a foundation for district committees to run cooperatives.

    2. Various departments cooperate to carry out business work in coordination with mutual aid and cooperation. The County Committee pays attention to unifying everyone's thinking through various meetings, so that various departments gradually clarify that they should cooperate with the mutual aid and cooperation movement to carry out their own business, and constantly study how business work can serve this central task. The Organization Department of the County Committee summarized the experience of the Bayu Township Branch in leading agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation to educate other branches. The Propaganda Department of the County Committee summarized the experience of the "May Fourth" Agricultural Production Cooperative in propaganda and education during the establishment of the cooperative and several issues in the political and ideological work of the Ma Yanhai Agricultural Production Cooperative, and organized the technical station to compile small propaganda materials such as cotton insect prevention and wheat seed selection, and distributed them to various places. The Youth League mobilized young people to actively participate in mutual aid and cooperative organizations, organized young people to sign contracts with technical stations, and learned advanced farming techniques and high-yield experience. These works have played a certain role in the development of mutual aid and cooperation.

    3. The County Committee pays attention to improving the level of leadership of district and township cadres and giving play to the role of Party organizations at all levels. This spring, the County Committee convened two joint meetings of district committee secretaries and township branch secretaries, and held a training class for township branch secretaries, specializing in studying how branches should lead mutual aid and cooperation. Now, district committees in various districts have explored some methods in leading mutual aid and cooperation. Generally, district committees are divided into townships by district committee members, leading mutual aid and cooperation through branches, and reporting to the district committee regularly. The district committee regularly discusses the main problems in current mutual aid and cooperation. In addition, the district committee regularly convenes joint meetings of township branch secretaries to study branch work and specifically help branches arrange various tasks with mutual aid and cooperation as the center. At present, the branch committees of stronger branches have been able to play a leading core role in the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and general branches can also make resolutions based on the instructions of the district committee and the problems in mutual aid and cooperation, educating Party members to take the lead and mobilizing the masses to complete them. Under the leadership of the branch committee, each township holds a representative meeting on mutual aid and cooperation once a month to exchange experiences and solve current problems.

    4. In the process of carrying out the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the County Committee pays attention to grasping the current key to increasing production. In the past, wheat yields in Dali County were not high. In addition to poor soil conditions, the main reason was sparse planting, coupled with the serious phenomenon of missing seedlings and broken rows, which affected the increase in yield. However, wheat yields were very high in areas with a good foundation for mutual aid and cooperation. For example, in 1953, the average wheat yield per mu in Dali was 173 jin, while the average yield per mu in the Huangpu Village Agricultural Production Cooperative was 247 jin. The reason why the wheat yield of the Huangpu Village Agricultural Production Cooperative was so high was because they improved all the drills last year, implemented close planting, and selected good varieties. The County Committee Secretary went deep into the village to study the issue of selecting good varieties and rational close planting. The County Committee used these specific facts to educate farmers by calculating detailed accounts and making comparisons, improving wheat drills, and narrowing row spacing. After the County Committee initially promoted this advanced experience, the average wheat yield per mu this year reached 198 jin, an increase of 25 jin per mu compared to last year. This not only convinced the masses to adopt new farming techniques, but also promoted the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement.

    5. In the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the County Committee cultivated key points and adopted various methods to promote the experience of key points. Organizing observation is a good way to promote the experience of key districts and villages. Since the spring plowing, various districts have organized observation two or three times. In Bayu Village, the Fourth District, the masses had many concerns in the establishment of the cooperative. The Party organization organized everyone to visit the autumn crops of the Huangpu Village Agricultural Production Cooperative. The visitors all said: "The crops of the cooperative are good, and it is right to join the cooperative." In addition, in the process of promoting key experiences, the County Committee also paid attention to discovering new creations among the masses, summarizing and implementing them.

    The Dali County Committee also has some problems in leading mutual aid and cooperation that need to be improved: the principle of collective leadership is not implemented enough. The County Committee has not systematically organized County Committee members to study the theoretical policies related to mutual aid and cooperation, and to systematically absorb experience by taking turns going deep into teams and cooperatives to improve the leadership level of County Committee members. Although the County Committee grasped the center when uniformly deploying work, it did not put forward specific requirements for the work of some departments.

    The County Committee's understanding of the importance of establishing and improving the cooperative network is insufficient. Last year, the county established a cooperative network centered on Huangpu Village, but due to the lack of clear understanding at the time, this matter was also rejected as a "five-too-many" phenomenon. With the continued development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the strength of cadres is even more insufficient, and it is very appropriate to strengthen leadership through the form of a mutual aid and cooperation network. Although the County Committee has paid attention to the education work of rural branches, 48 percent of the branches still cannot play any role in the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Very few rural Party members were developed in the first half of this year, and three districts did not develop a single Party member, which is not conducive to the great development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. In the future, it is necessary to actively and prudently develop Party members in the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and strengthen the leadership of rural branch work.
