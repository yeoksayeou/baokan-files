Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 8th: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the USSR issued a communiqué on the completion of the state grain procurement and purchase plan by collective farms and state farms across the Soviet Union after the 1954 harvest. The full text of the communiqué is as follows:

    Soviet collective farms and state farms, implementing the resolutions of the Communist Party and the Soviet government on striving for a rapid upsurge in agriculture, have achieved great success this year in increasing the production of grain and other agricultural products.

    As of November 5, 1954, collective farms and state farms across the country had pre-fulfilled the state grain requisition and purchase plan by 100.1 percent. The work of requisitioning and purchasing grain is still underway. The grain delivered and sold to the state is 289 million poods (each pood equals 32.76 Jin) more than in the same period in 1953. Among them, wheat is 91 million poods more than last year, rye is 65 million poods more, oats is 37 million poods more, fodder crops are 89 million poods more, and corn is 8 million poods more.

    Despite the unfavorable climatic conditions in southern Ukraine and the Volga region this year for the growth of grain and other crops, agricultural laborers have still increased the production and delivery of grain this year.

    Due to the drought, the government deemed it necessary to reduce the grain requisition volume in the Ukrainian Republic by 224.6 million poods, and also reduce the grain requisition volume in the Volga River basin regions.

    The reason why the national grain production and delivery volume can be greatly increased this year is mainly due to the effective reclamation of wasteland in Siberia, Kazakhstan, and the Urals, and the substantial increase in grain yield per unit area. This year, the total grain output in Siberia has doubled compared to last year, the total grain output in the Kazakh Republic has increased by 35 percent compared to last year, and the total grain output in the Altai Territory this year has increased by about four times.

    Collective farms and state farms in Siberia, Kazakhstan, and the Urals have greatly overfulfilled the state's grain requisition and purchase plan and their own socialist pledges.

    Collective farms and state farms in the Altai Territory have delivered and sold 222 million poods of grain to the state this year, 195 million poods more than last year; the Novosibirsk Oblast delivered and sold 74.1 million poods, 5.2 million poods more than last year; the Omsk Oblast delivered and sold 63 million poods, 30 million poods more than last year; the Krasnoyarsk Territory delivered and sold 56.3 million poods, 22 million poods more than last year; the Kurgan Oblast delivered and sold 50.9 million poods, 14 million poods more than last year; and the Bashkir Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic delivered 8 million poods more grain to the state than last year.

    Collective farms and state farms in the Krasnodar and Stavropol Territories, Rostov, Belgorod, Kursk, Orel, Lipetsk, Tambov, Voronezh, Chelyabinsk, Sverdlovsk, Tyumen, Kemerovo, Irkutsk, Tomsk, and other oblasts have also delivered and sold a large amount of grain to the state.

    The substantial increase in grain production and requisition and purchase volume in Siberia, Kazakhstan, the Urals, and many other regions of the Soviet Union is not only sufficient to compensate for the loss of grain harvests in drought-stricken areas, but also increases the total grain harvest in the country, making it possible to pre-fulfill the state's grain requisition plan and acquire more grain than last year.

    Collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms have greatly increased the production of potatoes and vegetables this year. As of November 1 this year, the state requisitioned and purchased 1,131,100 tons more potatoes and 437,000 tons more vegetables than last year.

    Due to the expansion of cotton planting area and the increase in cotton yield per unit area in major cotton-producing areas, cotton production has increased this year. The work of picking cotton and requisitioning raw cotton is currently underway. As of November 5 this year, the state requisitioned 228,000 tons more raw cotton than in the same period last year.

    Compared with last year, the production of flax fiber and flaxseed has also increased this year.

    Due to a series of measures taken in accordance with the resolution of the September 1953 Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the number of livestock of various products in the Soviet Union has increased.

    According to statistics from the Central Statistical Bureau under the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union on livestock, as of October 1, 1954, the number of livestock in the Soviet Union increased compared to October 1, 1953 as follows:

    Dairy cows increased by 1.5 million heads,
    The total number of cattle increased by 1.9 million heads,
    Pigs increased by 3.4 million heads,
    Sheep increased by 2.6 million heads.

    Due to the increase in the number of livestock and the increase in the productivity of livestock products, as of November 1 this year, the state requisitioned and purchased 233,000 tons more meat and 669,000 tons more milk than in the same period last year.

    This year, the income of collective farms has increased, so it is possible for collective farms to greatly expand the construction of production houses and cultural welfare buildings, and increase the cash and in-kind remuneration for collective farm members' workdays.

    Collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms across the country are working hard to create conditions for striving for a bumper harvest of all crops in 1955. Currently, the sowing plan for winter crops in various places has been overfulfilled. Collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms have sown 40 million hectares (each hectare equals 15 Mu) of winter crops, of which 19.7 million hectares are wheat, which is 1.6 million hectares more than last year. Collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms have now plowed 9.3 million hectares more autumn plowed land than last year. Collective farms and state farms have stored 12,163,000 metric tons more of grain and legume crop seeds, 127,000 metric tons of fiber flax seeds, and 22,551,000 metric tons of potato seeds than last year.

    Machine tractor stations in various places have given collective farms great assistance in various agricultural tasks. This year, the total amount of work done by machine tractor stations in collective farms, converted into cultivated land, increased by 67.4 million hectares compared to 1953, and combined harvesters harvested 82 percent of the grain of collective farms, which is 7.4 million hectares more than last year.

    The staff and students of many industrial enterprises, transportation industries, organizations and groups (and in some areas, soldiers of the Soviet Army) have actively assisted agriculture, especially in the harvest and requisition of grain.

    The task of reclaiming virgin and abandoned land put forward by the Party and the government has been widely responded to by collective farm members, staff of machine tractor stations and state farms, and the working people of the whole country. Thousands upon thousands of machine operators, collective farm members, workers and experts of machine tractor stations and state farms are victoriously working to accomplish this task of the whole people, creating glorious achievements.

    According to statistics as of November 5, collective farms and state farms across the Soviet Union have reclaimed a total of 17.43 million hectares of virgin and abandoned land, while the original plan stipulated that only 13 million hectares should be reclaimed.

    The vast majority of oblasts, krais, and autonomous republics of the Russian Federation and the vast majority of oblasts of the Kazakh Republic have greatly overfulfilled their tasks of reclaiming virgin and abandoned land.

    Those oblasts, krais, and autonomous republics of the Russian Federation and many collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms of the Kazakh Republic and the Uzbek Republic that did not undertake the task of reclaiming wasteland have also reclaimed 1,049,000 hectares of virgin and abandoned land, which is a manifestation of the entire people's support for the task of reclaiming virgin and abandoned land put forward by the Party and the government.

    This spring, a total of 3.6 million hectares of wheat and millet were sown on the newly reclaimed land, while the original plan stipulated that only 2.3 million hectares should be sown. Collective farms in various places have completed 156 percent of the plan for sowing grain on the newly reclaimed land, and state farms have completed 176 percent.

    All of this makes the Party Central Committee and the Soviet Council of Ministers fully believe that the sown area of newly reclaimed crops can reach 28 million to 30 million hectares in 1956.

    Such an expansion of the sown area will fully guarantee the country's grain consumption needs for requisitioned and purchased grain, and will allow the state to have the necessary amount of reserve grain and a sufficient amount of feed for the developing animal husbandry industry. The expansion of the sown area in the eastern region can expand the sown area of sugar beets, oil crops, and other industrial raw material crops, thereby ensuring a significant increase in the supply of sugar and oil and the supply of raw materials for light industry.

    Socialist agriculture has proved in fact that it is superior to any non-socialist agriculture, and that it can solve the task of meeting the growing needs of the national residents for agricultural products in a short period of time. Many advanced collective farms and state farms have now increased the harvest of agricultural crops per hundred hectares to such an extent that they can victoriously complete the task of fully meeting our country's needs with abundant agricultural products.

    The Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union held last September pointed out that the most urgent and important task in the current national economy is: to strive for a rapid upsurge in all sectors of agriculture while striving to develop heavy industry, to substantially increase the supply of food to all residents of our country, and to improve the material welfare of all collective farm peasant masses.

    The preliminary summary of the implementation of the resolutions of the three plenary sessions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in September 1953, February-March 1954, and June proves that we have all the necessary conditions to victoriously complete the tasks put forward by the Party.

    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union are satisfied to point out that in the process of striving to realize the plan for the rapid development of agriculture formulated by the Communist Party and the Soviet government, millions of men and women collective farm members, staff of machine tractor stations and state farms, and experts have shown the heroism and creativity of labor. The great assistance of socialist cities to agriculture has contributed to these many achievements in further developing agriculture. This year, our country's industry supplied agriculture with a large number of first-class machines. Many enterprises and agencies have sent skilled workers and experts to reclaim abandoned and virgin land, and to strengthen machine tractor stations and state farms. This reflects the great strength of the unbreakable alliance between the working class and collective farmers.

    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union are confident that the task of rapidly developing agriculture, a task of the whole people, will certainly be victoriously completed in the shortest period of time.

    苏共中央和苏联部长会议
    发表购粮计划完成情况的通报
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科八日电：苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议，发表了关于苏联各地集体农庄和国营农场在一九五四年收获后完成国家粮食征购和收购计划的情况的通报。通报全文如下：
    苏联集体农庄和国营农场执行共产党和苏联政府关于争取农业急剧高涨的决议，今年在增加谷物和其他农产品的产量方面已获得了巨大的成就。
    截至一九五四年十一月五日为止，各地集体农庄和国营农场已提前完成国家征购和收购谷物计划百分之一百零点一。征购和收购谷物的工作现在还在继续进行中。缴纳和出售给国家的谷物比一九五三年同时期多两亿八千九百万普特（每普特合三十二点七六市斤）。其中，小麦比去年多九千一百万普特，稞麦多六千五百万普特，燕麦多三千七百万普特，饲料作物多八千九百万普特，玉蜀黍多八百万普特。
    尽管今年乌克兰南部和伏尔加流域地区的气候条件不利于谷物和其他农作物的生长，但是农业劳动者今年仍增加了谷物的产量和交纳量。
    由于经受了旱灾，政府认为有必要把乌克兰共和国的谷物征购量减少二亿二千四百六十万普特，并且减少伏尔加河流域各地区的谷物征购量。
    今年全国谷物产量和交纳量之所以能够大大增加，主要是由于西伯利亚、哈萨克和乌拉尔等地区有效地进行了开垦荒地并大大提高了谷物的单位面积产量。今年，西伯利亚地区的谷物总产量增加为去年的两倍，哈萨克共和国的谷物总产量比去年增加了百分之三十五，阿尔泰边疆区今年的谷物总产量约增加为四倍。
    西伯利亚、哈萨克和乌拉尔的集体农庄和国营农场已经大大超额完成了国家征购和收购谷物的计划及自己的社会主义保证。
    阿尔泰边疆区的集体农庄和国营农场今年已向国家缴纳和出售了二亿二千二百万普特谷物，比去年多一亿九千五百万普特；新西伯利亚州缴纳和出售了七千四百一十万普特，比去年多五百二十万普特；鄂木斯克州缴纳和出售了六千三百万普特，比去年多三千万普特；克拉斯诺雅尔斯克边疆区缴纳和出售了五千六百三十万普特，比去年多二千二百万普特；库尔干州缴纳和出售了五千零九十万普特，比去年多一千四百万普特；巴什基尔自治共和国比去年多给国家交纳了八百万普特谷物。
    哈萨克共和国的集体农庄和国营农场已向国家缴纳和出售了二亿三千二百一十万普特谷物，比去年多了一亿零九百万普特。
    克拉斯诺达和斯塔夫罗波尔边疆区，罗斯托夫、别尔哥罗德、库尔斯克、奥勒尔、利佩茨克、坦波夫、利森、车里雅宾斯克、斯维德洛夫斯克、邱门、基米罗伏、伊尔库次克、托木斯克以及其他州的集体农庄和国营农场，也向国家缴纳和出售了大量的谷物。
    西伯利亚、哈萨克、乌拉尔以及苏联许多其他地区的谷物生产以及征购和收购量的大大增加，不仅足以弥补遭受旱灾地区的谷物歉收的损失，而且还使全国的谷物总收获量增加了，使得国家的谷物征购计划可能提前超额完成，国家所征购得的谷物也比去年多。
    集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场今年大大增加了马铃薯和蔬菜的生产。截至今年十一月一日为止，国家征购和收购的马铃薯比去年多一百一十三万一千吨，蔬菜比去年多四十三万七千吨。
    由于扩大了主要植棉地区的棉花播种面积并提高了棉花单位面积产量，今年棉花的产量增加了。目前正在进行摘棉和征购原棉的工作。截至今年十一月五日为止，国家征购的原棉已比去年同时期多二十二万八千吨。
    和去年相比，今年亚麻纤维和亚麻籽的产量也增加了。
    由于根据苏联共产党中央委员会一九五三年九月全体会议的决议而采取了一系列措施，苏联各种产品牲畜的头数增加了。
    根据苏联部长会议所属中央统计局关于牲畜的统计材料，到一九五四年十月一日为止，苏联牲畜的头数和一九五三年十月一日比较增加的情形如下：
    乳牛增加了一百五十万头，
    牛的总数增加了一百九十万头，
    猪增加了三百四十万口，
    羊增加了两百六十万只。
    由于牲畜头数的增加和牲畜产品生产率的提高，截至今年十一月一日为止，国家征购和收购的肉类比去年同时期多二十三万三千吨，乳类多六十六万九千吨。
    今年，集体农庄的收入增加了，因此集体农庄就有可能大大扩大生产用房屋和文化福利建筑物的建设，并增加集体农庄庄员的劳动日的现金和实物报酬。
    全国的集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场正努力工作，以便为争取一九五五年一切农作物的丰收创造条件。现在，各地冬季作物的播种计划已超额完成了。集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场已播种了四千万公顷（每公顷合十五市亩）的冬季作物，其中小麦一千九百七十万公顷，即比去年多一百六十万公顷。集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场现在翻耕好的秋耕地已比去年多九百三十万公顷。集体农庄和国营农场比去年多储存了一千二百一十六万三千公担谷物和豆类作物的种子，十二万七千公担纤维用亚麻种子和二千二百五十五万一千公担马铃薯种子。
    各地机器拖拉机站在各种农业工作方面给了集体农庄很大的帮助。今年机器拖拉机站在集体农庄中作的工作总量，折合成耕地计算，比一九五三年增加了六千七百四十万公顷，并用联合机收割了集体农庄百分之八十二的谷物，即比去年多收割了七百四十万公顷。
    许多工业企业、运输业、机关团体的职工和学生（有些地区还有苏军军人），都对农业特别是在收获和征购粮食方面进行了积极的帮助。
    党和政府所提出的开垦生荒地和熟荒地的任务，获得了集体农庄庄员、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的工作人员以及全国劳动人民的广泛响应。千千万万的机器操使者、集体农庄庄员、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的工人和专家们，都在为完成这项全民的任务而胜利地劳动着，创造着光荣的功绩。
    根据截至十一月五日为止的统计材料，全苏联的集体农庄和国营农场共开垦了一千七百四十三万公顷的生荒地和熟荒地，而原订计划规定只开垦一千三百万公顷。
    俄罗斯联邦绝大多数的州、边疆区和自治共和国以及哈萨克共和国绝大多数的州，都大大超额完成了它们开垦生荒地和熟荒地的任务。
    那些没有承担开垦荒地的任务的俄罗斯联邦的州、边疆区和自治共和国以及哈萨克共和国、乌兹别克共和国的许多集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场也开垦了一百零四万九千公顷的生荒地和熟荒地，这就是全体人民拥护党和政府所提出的开垦生荒地和熟荒地的任务的表现。
    今年春天，在开垦好的新的土地上共播种了三百六十万公顷的小麦和黍，而原计划规定只播种二百三十万公顷。各地集体农庄完成了在新开垦的土地上播种谷物的计划的百分之一百五十六，各国营农场完成了百分之一百七十六。
    这一切都使党中央委员会和苏联部长会议充分相信：一九五六年新开垦的农作物播种面积可达二千八百万至三千万公顷。
    这样扩大播种面积后，将可以使征购和收购的谷物充分保证全国的谷物消费需要，可以使国家有必要数量的储备谷物和足够数量的供给发展中的畜牧业用的饲料。东部地区播种面积的扩大可以使甜菜、油料作物和其他工业原料作物的播种面积扩大，从而保证大大增加食糖和油类的供应量和轻工业原料的供应量。
    社会主义农业用事实证明：它优越于任何非社会主义农业，它可以在短时期内解决满足全国居民对农产品日益增长的需要的任务。许多先进的集体农庄和国营农场现在每一百公顷的农作物收获量已经提高到这样的程度：可以胜利地完成以丰富的农产品充分满足我国的需要的任务。
    去年九月所召开的苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议曾指出，当前在国民经济方面最迫切、最重要的任务是：和尽力发展重工业的同时，争取农业各部门的急剧高涨，大量增加对我国全体居民食品的供应量和提高所有集体农庄农民群众的物质福利。
    执行苏联共产党中央委员会一九五三年九月、一九五四年二月—三月和六月三次全体会议决议的初步总结证明，我们具备一切必要的条件来胜利地完成党所提出的任务。
    苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议满意地指出，在努力实现共产党和苏联政府所制订的急速发展农业的计划的过程中，千百万男女集体农庄庄员、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的工作人员和专家们表现了劳动的英雄气概和创造精神。社会主义城市对农业的巨大帮助，有助于在进一步发展农业方面获得这许多成就。今年我国工业供给农业以大量的头等机器。许多企业和机关都派出了熟练的工人和专家去开垦熟荒地和生荒地，去加强机器拖拉机站和国营农场。这反映了工人阶级和集体农民牢不可破的联盟的伟大力量。
    苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议确信，急速发展农业这一全民任务一定可以在最短时期内胜利完成。
