    Strive for the Complete Mechanization of Collective Farm Production
    Dé·Mǎliǔtà (德·马留塔), Director of the Midvidov Machine Tractor Station, Krasnodar Krai, Soviet Union

    Our Machine Tractor Station is located in the heart of the Kuban, not far from the city of Krasnodar. It serves three collective farms with 34,000 hectares of land. The collective farms are now summarizing their economic work for the year. This year, the climatic conditions in our region were not good, but the collective farms still planted 10,000 hectares of winter wheat, averaging 18 quintals of grain per hectare. The corn harvest was even higher than winter wheat—30 quintals per hectare. Other crops also yielded bumper harvests. For example, the original target for hemp stalks was 27 quintals per hectare, but the actual harvest was 45 quintals per hectare.

    In this regard, the machine operators and experts of the Machine Tractor Station have made significant contributions. The Soviet state has equipped our Machine Tractor Station with powerful, modern machinery. Our Machine Tractor Station has 128 tractors, 42 grain combines, and hundreds of plows, seeders, and other machines. We also have no shortage of personnel. The Machine Tractor Station has 280 permanent skilled workers, including 230 tractor drivers. The six agronomists, five livestock specialists, and other experts who serve the collective farms are all paid by the state.

    All the staff of the Machine Tractor Station strive to make full use of the machinery and, on this basis, improve cultivation and increase the income of the collective farms. In the past five years, the workload of each 15-horsepower tractor (calculated according to the area of cultivable land) has increased by 180 hectares, reaching 670 hectares this year. The annual output of each of our tractors is no less than 12,000 poods of grain.

    Because of the excellent utilization of machinery, all field work has been fully mechanized. Currently, the Machine Tractor Station undertakes more than 110 types of work. Manual labor has been completely replaced by machinery in plowing, sowing, managing intertilled crops and industrial crops, harvesting grain, sunflowers, corn, flax, clover, as well as mowing, silage, shearing sheep, and other tasks.

    As everyone knows, machine operators spend most of their time in the fields during the summer. Therefore, the Machine Tractor Station and the collective farms try to create normal living conditions for them. Tractor drivers and implement operators live in specially built houses in field camps. Each field camp has a garden and many flowerbeds nearby. Sports fields have been built in the camps. Good rest is essential for high work efficiency.

    It has become common for workers in tractor teams to master several skills. Most tractor drivers are proficient in three or four skills. For example, during this year's harvest season, 35 tractor drivers served as assistants to combine operators, and five served as drivers of winnowing machines. The Machine Tractor Station has many caterpillar tractors. In previous years, these tractor drivers had no work to do after spring sowing. But this year, they engaged in shearing sheep with electric clippers. Combine operators also had many new tasks. For example, during the sowing season, they served as adjusters for square-hole seeders, and in the autumn they served as drivers of hemp harvesting machines.

    The collective farms served by our Machine Tractor Station have diversified economic sectors. In terms of field farming, most of the land is used to grow grain and industrial crops. At the same time, they also produce many vegetables, fruits, grapes, and potatoes. There are many livestock on the collective farms' livestock farms. This year, the collective farms, with the help of the Machine Tractor Station, provided the livestock industry with ample roughage, succulent feed, and concentrated feed.

    The entire staff of the Machine Tractor Station, in creative cooperation with the collective farmers, has done a great deal of work in fully mechanizing the heavy operations of the livestock farms. For example, in the livestock farms of the three collective farms we serve, water supply and milking are completely mechanized. In the summer, livestock pens are equipped with many feed boilers and other equipment.

    The machine operators and experts have not rested on their laurels; they are constantly looking for potential to further improve their production indicators. We have set ourselves the task of not only completing all the work entrusted to us in the contracts signed with the collective farms in a timely and high-quality manner but also of spending as little state funds as possible. We have achieved this. The actual value of cultivating each hectare of cultivated land in 1954 was reduced by nearly one-half compared to 1949.

    With the mechanization of collective farm production and the expansion of field harvests and livestock products, public wealth has also increased. Last year, the cash income of our three collective farms was 22.4 million rubles. This year, a comprehensive summary of the economic year has not yet been made, but it is expected that this year's income will increase significantly compared to last year.

    We pay special attention to establishing a good production technology base at the Machine Tractor Station. In the past year alone, we have built brick warehouses for storing combines and seed cleaning facilities. To improve the lives of workers, we also built bathrooms and installed running water equipment.

    The entire staff of our Machine Tractor Station is full of creative energy. Currently, we have completed the plowing of 13,000 hectares of autumn-plowed land and have begun the machine repair work for the autumn and winter seasons. Experts are formulating plans for next year. These plans will stipulate further increasing field yields and more fully mechanizing the operations of all production sectors of the collective farms.

    为集体农庄生产的全部机械化而斗争
    苏联克拉斯诺达尔边疆区米德维多夫机器拖拉机站站长
    德·马留塔
    我们的机器拖拉机站位于离克拉斯诺达尔城不远的库班的中心。它为三个拥有三万四千公顷土地的集体农庄服务。现在，集体农庄正在作一年的经济工作总结。今年我们地区的气候条件不好，可是集体农庄仍然栽种了一万公顷土地的冬小麦，平均每公顷收割十八公担谷物。玉蜀黍的收获量比冬小麦更高——每公顷收割三十公担。其它作物也获得了丰收。例如，大麻的茎秆原规定每公顷收割二十七公担，但结果每公顷却收割了四十五公担。
    在这方面，机器拖拉机站的机器操使者和专家们有不少的功绩。苏维埃国家以强大的现代化的机器装备了我们的机器拖拉机站。我们的机器拖拉机站拥有一百二十八台拖拉机，四十二台谷物联合收割机，数百个犁，播种机和其他机器。干部方面也不感缺乏。机器拖拉机站共有二百八十名固定的熟练工人，其中有二百三十名拖拉机手。为集体农庄服务的六个农学家、五个饲畜师和其他专家都是由国家负担他们的费用。
    机器拖拉机站的全体人员努力来充分运用机器，并在此基础上改进耕耘工作和提高集体农庄的收入。在最近五年来，每台十五匹马力的拖拉机
  （按应耕地计算）的工作量增加了一百八十公顷，今年的工作量达到了六百七十公顷。我们的每台拖拉机一年的工作成果不少于一万二千普特谷物。
    因为很好地利用了机器，所以一切田间工作都全部机械化了。现在，机器拖拉机站从事一百一十种以上的工作。在耕耘、播种、管理中耕作物和技术作物方面，在收割谷物、向日葵、玉蜀黍、亚麻、三叶草以及割草，青储饲料，剪羊毛和其他工作上完全以机器代替了手工操作。
    大家都知道，夏季，机器操使者大部分时间是在田间。因之，机器拖拉机站和集体农庄就设法为他们建立起正常的生活条件。拖拉机手和连挂机手都是住在田野营中专设的小屋里。每个田野营的附近都有花园和许多花圃。在野营里修建了运动场。要使工作效率高，就必须好好休息。
    在拖拉机工作队里一人掌握几种技能的情况已经很普遍了。大多数的拖拉机手都能精通三四种技能。例如，在今年收割时期，有三十五名拖拉机手担任了联合收割机手的助手，五名担任了簸谷机的驾驶员。机器拖拉机站拥有许多履带拖拉机。前些年，在春季播种以后，这些拖拉机手就无工作可作了。可是今年他们却从事了用电动剪毛器剪羊毛的工作。联合收割机手们也有了许多新的任务。例如，在播种时期，他们担任正方穴播机的调节手，到秋天他们就担任剥麻收割机的驾驶员。
    我们的机器拖拉机站所服务的集体农庄都拥有多种经济部门。在田野农作业方面，大部分土地用来栽种谷物和技术作物。同时它们也生产许多蔬菜、水果、葡萄、马铃薯。在集体农庄的饲畜牧放场里有许多牲畜。今年，集体农庄在机器拖拉机站的帮助下供给了饲畜业充足的粗饲料、多汁饲料和精饲料。
    机器拖拉机站的全体人员，在与集体农民创造性的合作之下，在使饲畜牧放场繁重操作的过程全部机械化方面做了许多工作。例如，在我们所服务的三个集体农庄的养畜场中，水的供应和挤奶都完全机械化了。夏天，牲畜栏里安装了许多饲料煮沸器和其他装备。
    机器操使者和专家们并没有停留在已达到的成就上，他们不断地寻找进一步改进自己的生产指标的潜力。我们给自己提出了这样的任务，不仅及时地和高质量地完成与集体农庄所订立的合同中委托我们的全部工作，并且要尽量少花费国家资金。这一点我们是做到了。一九五四年每一公顷熟耕地耕耘的实际价值比一九四九年降低了将近二分之一。
    随着集体农庄生产的机械化、随着田间收获量和牲畜产品的扩大，公有财富也增加了。去年，我们的三个集体农庄的现金收入为二千二百四十万卢布。今年，还没有作出经济年度的全面的总结，但是预计今年的收入将比去年增加很多。
    我们特别注意在机器拖拉机站建立良好的生产技术基础。仅在去年一年内，我们就修建了砖砌的停放联合收割机的库房和种子清涤场所。为了改善工人的生活，还盖了浴室，安装了自来水设备。
    我们机器拖拉机站的全体人员充满了创造力量。现在，我们完成了翻耕一万三千公顷秋翻地的工作，并已着手进行秋冬季节的机器修理工作。专家们正在制定明年的计划。在这些计划中将规定进一步提高田地的收获量，使集体农庄各个生产部门的操作更加充分地机械化。
