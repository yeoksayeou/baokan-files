Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 2nd: TASS reported from Moscow on November 2nd: Édouard Herriot, Honorary President of the French National Assembly, sent a telegram to Soviet Supreme Soviet representatives Volkov (Chairman of the Union Council), Lācīs (Chairman of the Council of Nationalities), and nine others, in response to their congratulatory telegram to Herriot on the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and France.

The reply telegram first expressed gratitude to Volkov and others; then stated: "I am very pleased to have established diplomatic relations between us during a difficult period. I believe that it is impossible to simply erase a large country like the Soviet Union from the map. Today, I believe that the union of a part of Europe is only an arbitrary and dangerous solution."

The reply telegram earnestly hoped that the people of all countries, especially the people of France and the Soviet Union, could work and live in an environment of lasting peace without worrying about foolish wars.

The reply telegram finally extended greetings to all the people of the Soviet Union.

    感谢苏法建交三十周年的贺电
    赫里欧复电苏最高苏维埃代表沃尔科夫等
    【新华社二日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二日讯：法国国民议会名誉议长爱德华·赫里欧致电苏联最高苏维埃代表沃尔科夫（联盟院主席）、拉齐斯（民族院主席）等九人，答复他们为苏联和法国建立外交关系三十周年致赫里欧的贺电。
    复电首先对沃尔科夫等人表示感谢；接着说：“我很高兴能在一个困难的时期建立了我们之间的外交关系。我相信：要把苏联这样一个大国从地图上随便抹消是不可能的。今天，我相信欧洲一部分国家的联合只是一种专断的、危险的解决方法。”
    复电热烈希望各国人民、特别是法苏两国人民能够不用担心愚蠢的战争，能够在持久和平的环境中工作和生活。
    复电最后向苏联全体人民致意。
