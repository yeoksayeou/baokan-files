Glacier
—Communication from the Kangzang Highway
By our reporter Shen Shi
　　Political Instructor Ye Chunsheng wore a set of blue cloth uniform like the workers. On his chest hung the Huaihai Campaign commemorative medal. Without asking him, people could guess that he was transferred from the army. Last year, he left the army and came to the 14th Team of the Second Engineering Area of the Construction Detachment. Only a few days after arriving at this team, he attended an engineering technology meeting. After he spoke at the meeting, someone said, "You just arrived here and don't understand anything about engineering, so it's better to say less!" Ye Chunsheng felt sad after hearing this, but he thought: He had just left the army, and he was indeed a layman when it came to highway engineering. But as long as he did a good job in the team's political work, relied on the workers, and humbly learned from them, people would change their views of him over time.

　　He encountered quicksand in the Bomi area as soon as he participated in highway construction. Quicksand was a new problem encountered since the construction of the Kangzang Highway. It stretched from the top of the mountain to the foot, mixed with large and small stones. As soon as it was touched, it would pour down from above.

　　Ye Chunsheng thought: Constructing in the quicksand area, two people digging and one person carrying could not keep up with the amount flowing down from the mountain. At this rate, when would this section of the road be completed? He mobilized the workers and technicians to come up with more ideas. The workers suggested building protective walls made of thick wood and stones at the foot of the mountain to block the quicksand. Ye Chunsheng and the team leader supported their suggestion, and it was successful after design and testing, thus solving the difficulty.

　　In May of this year, the workers of the Second Engineering Area encountered the collapse of a glacier while working in the "Suowaka" area of Bomi.

　　Glacier, this is another new problem encountered since the construction of the Kangzang Highway.

　　Glaciers, like silver ribbons, adorn several mountain tops of the Nianqing Tanggula and Ningjing mountain ranges. When clouds rise and the mist on the mountainside moves with the wind, the glacier hides for a while and then reveals its true face again. On clear days, the sky is clear, and the sun shines on the "hanging river" on the high mountains, reflecting a silver light. People can imagine how magnificent the mountains and rivers on the plateau are.

　　The wide glacier on the opposite bank of Xinluhai near Manigen Ge extends from the mountainside to the lake. The water under the ice layer flows continuously into the lake all year round. Who wouldn't want to linger longer to enjoy the lake water, high mountains, pine forests, reflections on the lake, and silvery white glaciers!

　　When a glacier is calm, it lies in deep mountains and valleys all year round, adding to the beauty of the mountains and rivers. Once affected, it will suddenly roar. At that time, ice, mud, and boulders will pour down from the high mountains, turning small streams into deep gullies, cutting off thick trees in the middle, or washing them away without a trace; sometimes, blocking riverbeds and diverting rivers.

　　East of Suowaka, there is a village called "Gu" by the Tibetans. There, on the mountain to the north, a huge glacier has been lying for thousands of years. The water under the glacier forms a small stream, passes through the canyon, crosses the pine forest at the foot of the mountain, and flows into the Yarlung Zangbo (River)'s tributary—the Palong Zangbo. In 1950, there was an earthquake in this area, which loosened the ice layer and the sand and gravel under the ice. Last autumn, the glacier continued to collapse, and a wide, dry riverbed replaced the dense pine forest. The riverbed was full of gravel and boulders, some piled up into small hills, and some lying like sand ridges. A clear stream still flowed from the canyon in the north to the river. The newly built highway ran across the riverbed and stretched westward, and the glacier still remained on the nearby mountain.

　　In May, Bomi, the Jiangnan of the Kangzang Plateau, had a warm climate. The workers of the 23rd Team arrived at "Gu" and pitched their tents on the nearby river beach. The local Tibetans saw it and told them about the glacier collapse last year. They moved their tents away and started work the next day. Just as the workers were building the road along the river, continuous "rumbling" sounds came from the mountain. Mud mixed with large and small stones poured down from the canyon in the north. The glacier collapsed, and the workers quickly avoided it. The mud and rocks continued to flow. At night, the stones collided with each other, bursting out countless sparks. Traffic was interrupted, and grain on the east bank of the riverbed was piling up day by day. The powerful road construction team gathered at the construction site west of the glacier.

　　The soldiers and workers west of the glacier could not be allowed to go hungry, and the entire project could not be affected by the glacier collapse. A solution had to be found.

　　The wisdom and energy of thousands of people converged on the glacier. The pranks of nature could not defeat the road construction army, nor could they stop the westward advance of the highway.

　　Guard posts were set up on the mountain slopes on both sides of the riverbed. During the day, red flags were raised on the mountain slopes. At night, gunshots were heard, telling people that mud and rocks were rushing down. When the mud and rocks stopped flowing, the workers took advantage of the gaps to rush to repair temporary roads and build temporary bridges. As soon as a loaded truck passed, the red flag on the mountain slope waved again. The temporary road and bridge were destroyed, and they quickly repaired them again. Destroyed and repaired, repaired and destroyed, how many times did this happen! Later, they erected two zip lines on both sides of the riverbed, and people and supplies crossed on the zip lines.

　　Soon, the 23rd Team transferred to a new construction site. The arduous task of fighting the glacier all fell on Ye Chunsheng's team. They had to continue to carry grain and build pedestrian suspension bridges, rush to repair temporary bridges and roads.

　　The workers built a steel cable suspension bridge in a very short time. Ye Chunsheng thought: With the suspension bridge and the zip line, the transportation of materials was faster than before. But what about livestock? They couldn't pass through the suspension bridge. It took half an hour for people to carry supplies back and forth. This speed was still not enough to meet the needs of the construction site west of the glacier!

　　Whenever the glacier was about to flood, the workers always prepared wood in advance. When the temporary bridge in the riverbed was washed away, they used wood and stones to build bridge piers. Ye Chunsheng thought: Continuing like this would not only waste manpower and wood, but also could not guarantee the needs of the front. The key in the future was the temporary bridge. If the temporary bridge was not washed away, the transportation of materials would be solved.

　　The bridge pier on the west bank of the small stream used a huge rock. The bridge pier on the east bank was located in the center of the riverbed and was entirely built of wood and stones. During the glacier floods, the bridge pier on the east side was always washed away.

　　One morning, the glacier stopped flooding. Ye Chunsheng went to inspect the temporary bridge. He found that several relatively thick pieces of wood at the bottom of the east bridge pier had not been washed away. He thought: Why were only these thick pieces of wood not washed away? He saw that the bridge pier on the west bank could withstand the impact of mud and rocks every time, and he had an idea.

　　He returned to the team headquarters and found the trade union chairman Huang Jichao and the engineering technician, and said to them: "Can the wood for the bridge pier be longer and thicker? One layer of wood, one layer of stones, and reinforced with iron wire on the outside, it must be strong."

　　"Let's try it, I'm afraid the workers won't be able to lift such thick wood," Huang Jichao said.

　　"That's easy to solve, we can send more people to carry the wood," Ye Chunsheng said.

　　From then on, the twelve-meter-long, thirty-five-centimeter-thick wood was carried one by one from the nearby mountains to the construction site. The workers built the bridge pier on the east bank of the stream according to Ye Chunsheng's suggestion. The temporary bridge was built and stood in the center of the riverbed after the glacier flood, and was not washed away. The loaded trucks passed through the temporary bridge and the area flooded by the glacier, driving westward day and night. The workers of the 14th Team overcame the numerous difficulties caused by the glacier, and victoriously left the glacier and transferred to the Seqila construction site. Although Ye Chunsheng had only been in this team for more than a year, he was already a prestigious instructor among the workers.

    冰川                 
    —康藏公路通讯
  　本报记者　沈石
    政治指导员叶春生和工人一样，穿着一套蓝布制服，他的胸前，挂着淮海战役的纪念章，人们不问他，就可以猜测到他是从部队转业过来的。去年，他离开了部队，来到施工支队二工区第十四中队。到这个中队只有几天，他出席了一次工程技术会议，他在会上讲过话以后，有人说：“你刚到这里，不懂什么工程，还是少说点话吧！”叶春生听了，心里虽然难过，但是他想：自己刚刚离开部队，对于公路工程，的确是门外汉，但只要做好中队的政治工作，依靠工人，虚心向他们学习，日子一久，人家会改变对自己的看法的。
    他刚参加公路建设，就碰上波密地区的流沙。流沙，这是康藏公路修筑以来遇到的一个新问题。它从山上一直伸展到山脚，里面还夹杂着大大小小的石块。只要一动它，它就从上面倾泻下来。
    叶春生想：在流沙地带施工，两个人挖一个人挑，还赶不上从山头流下的多，这样下去，这段路什么时候才能竣工呢？他便发动工人和技术员多想办法。工人们建议，在山脚下，用粗大的木头和石块，做成防护墙，来阻挡流沙。叶春生和中队长支持了他们的建议，经过设计和试验后成功了，就这样把困难解决了。
    今年五月，二工区的工人们，在波密地区“索瓦卡”一带施工，碰上了冰川的崩溃。
    冰川，这是康藏公路修筑以来又一个新问题。
    冰川，它像银练一样，点缀在他念他翁、唐古拉和宁静山脉的若干山头。当云层四起，山腰的云雾随风移动，冰川，一忽儿躲藏起来，一忽儿又显出了真面目。在晴朗的日子里，碧空万里，太阳照着那高山上的“悬河”，反射出银色的光芒，人们可以想像到高原上的河山是多么的壮丽。
    马尼根果附近的新路海，那湖对岸宽阔的冰川，从山腰一直铺到湖边。冰层下的流水长年不断的流入湖里。对这湖水、高山、松林、湖上的倒影、银白色的冰川，游览的人，谁不爱多留恋一些时候！
    冰川，当它平静的时候，它常年地躺在深山巨谷里，增添着山河的美丽。一旦受到影响，它会突然地咆哮起来，那时候，冰块、泥浆和巨石，从高山上直泻下来，将小溪变成深沟，将粗大的树木拦腰截断，或者冲得无影无纵；有时候，将河床堵塞，让河流改道。
    索瓦卡以东，有一处村庄，藏胞叫它做“谷”。那里，北边的山头，千百年来，躺着巨大的冰川，冰川下的水，汇成小溪，经过峡谷，穿过山下的松林，流向雅鲁藏布（江）的支流——迫龙藏布。一九五零年，这一带曾发生地震，震松了冰层和冰下的沙石。去年秋季，冰川不断地崩溃，宽阔干涸的河沟代替了茂密的松林，河沟里尽是沙砾和巨石，有的堆成小丘，有的像沙梁一样躺着，一泓清水，仍从北边的峡谷流到江里，新修的公路，横贯河沟，向西伸展，那冰川仍残留在附近的山上。
    五月，康藏高原上的江南——波密，气候温暖，二十三中队的工人们到达“谷”，他们将帐篷搭在附近的河滩上。当地的藏胞看见了，告诉他们去年冰川崩溃的情形，他们将帐篷搬走，第二天开工了，正当工人们在河沿筑路的时候，山上连续传来“轰隆”、“轰隆”的响声，泥浆飘浮着大大小小的石块，从北边的峡谷倾泻下来，冰川崩溃了，工人们赶忙避开。泥浆岩石不断地奔流，夜里，石块撞击着石块，迸裂出无数的火星，交通中断了，河沟东岸的粮食，一天天地堆积起来，强大的筑路队伍，却聚集在冰川以西的工地。
    不能让冰川以西的战士和工人挨饿，不能因冰川崩溃影响到整个工程，得想办法。
    千百人的智慧和精力都汇集在冰川上，大自然的恶作剧难不倒筑路大军，也阻挡不了公路的西进。
    河沟两岸的山岗上，有了警戒哨，白天，山岗上扬起红旗，夜里，传来了枪声，告诉人们，泥浆岩石冲下来了。当泥浆岩石停止流动，工人们就利用间隙，抢修便道，架设便桥。等到载重汽车刚刚通过，山岗上的红旗又在摇动，便道和便桥冲毁了，他们很快的重新修复，毁了又修，修了又毁，这样经过多少次啊！后来，他们在河沟两岸架起了两根溜索，行人和物资都从溜索上渡过。
    不久，二十三中队转移到新的工地，向冰川战斗这一艰巨的任务，全部落在叶春生这个中队，他们要继续背运粮食，架设人行吊桥。抢修便桥和便道。
    工人们在很短的时间内，架好了钢索吊桥。叶春生想：有了吊桥，有了溜索，物资的输送比从前要快一些了。但是牲畜呢，不能通过吊桥。人背运物资，来回一趟，需要半个钟头，这样的速度，仍然赶不上冰川以西工地的需要啊！
    每当冰川泛滥以前，工人们总是事先备好木料，等到河沟里的便桥被冲毁，他们又用木料和石块叠砌桥基，叶春生想：这样下去，不但浪费人力和木料，且不能保证前面的需要，今后的关键，在于便桥，如果便桥不被冲毁，输送物资，就随着解决了。
    那小溪西岸的桥基，利用一块巨大的岩石。东岸的桥基，位置在河沟的中心，全是木料和石块叠砌起来的，冰川泛滥的时候，东边的桥基总被冲毁。
    一个早上，冰川停止了泛滥，叶春生去察看便桥，他发现东边桥基的底层，有几根比较粗大的木头没有被水冲走，他想：为什么只有这几根粗大的木头没有被水冲走呢？他看到西岸桥基每次都挡得住泥浆岩石的冲击，他心中有个数了。
    他回到队部，找到工会主席黄继超和工程技术员等，对他们说：“桥基的木料，能不能再长些，再粗些？一层木料，垒砌一层石头，外面用铁丝加固，一定要牢靠些。”
      “我们试试看吧，只怕那样粗大的木料工人们抬不动。”黄继超说。
      “这倒容易办，可多派一些人抬木头。”叶春生说。
    从此以后，那十二公尺长、三十五公分粗的木头，从附近的山上一根一根的抬到了工地，工人们根据叶春生的建议，砌好了溪东岸的桥基。便桥架好了，经过泥浆立在河沟的中心，没有被冲毁。那载重汽车通过便桥和冰川泛滥过的地段，日日夜夜地向西驶去，十四中队的工人们，克服了冰川造成的重重困难，胜利地离开了冰川，转移到色齐拉工地。叶春生，他到这个中队虽然只有一年多，但在工人中，他已经是一个有威信的指导员了。
