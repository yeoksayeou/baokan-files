　　Soviet Experts Help Tianjin University with Teaching Reform
　　In the process of teaching reform, Tianjin University has received friendly assistance from Soviet experts.
　　Soviet experts lectured to over a hundred teachers and graduate students at Tianjin University on courses such as "Refractory Materials Technology," "Fixed Nitrogen Engineering," and "Hydraulic Soil Improvement," disseminating advanced Soviet scientific and technological knowledge to Chinese teachers. With the help of Soviet experts, the Department of Chemical Engineering's silicate engineering and other specialties formulated teaching plans and teaching syllabi for many specialties. Soviet experts also helped teachers master advanced teaching methods. In the past, teachers only conducted classroom lectures, but now, teachers have gradually mastered new teaching elements such as experiments, classroom exercises, and course design, making theory more closely connected with practice. Soviet experts also helped teachers carry out scientific research work. They introduced the experience of Soviet universities in carrying out scientific research work. Soviet experts proposed sixteen scientific research topics to the refractory materials teaching and research section.
　　Soviet experts frequently went deep into departments, teaching and research sections, and even classrooms and laboratories to help teachers solve teaching problems. In the past, Tong Mingda, director of the refractory materials teaching and research section, did not have systematic teaching materials when lecturing on "Refractory Materials Technology." After listening to the expert's lecture, he revised the teaching materials to make them more systematic and complete. Tong Mingda said: In the last semester, the Soviet expert, Vigeiguang, wrote 150,000 words of handouts for us. What enthusiastic help this is! Soviet experts paid special attention to improving the professional level of young teachers, often listening to teaching assistants' lectures and offering suggestions for improvement. When Li Shaofen, a teaching assistant in the inorganic matter engineering teaching and research section, lectured on "Sulfuric Acid," the expert Akhmetov often helped and encouraged him. Experts not only personally helped graduate students improve their ideology and professional level, but also cared about their lives and rest. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　苏联专家帮助天津大学进行教学改革
    天津大学在教学改革过程中，得到苏联专家的友谊帮助。
    苏联专家给天津大学一百多名教师和研究生讲授“耐火材料工艺学”、“固定氮工学”和“水利土壤改良”等课程，把苏联先进的科学技术知识传播给中国教师。在苏联专家帮助下，化学工程系的矽酸盐工学等专业制订了教学计划和很多专业的教学大纲。苏联专家还帮助教师们掌握先进的教学方法。过去教师只是进行课堂讲授，现在，教师们已逐渐掌握实验、课堂练习和课程设计等新的教学环节，使理论更密切地联系实际。苏联专家还帮助教师开展科学研究工作，他们介绍苏联高等学校开展科学研究工作的经验，苏联专家给耐火材料教研室提出了十六项科学研究题目。
    苏联专家经常深入到系、教研室以至课堂和实验室，帮助教师们解决教学上的问题。耐火材料教研室主任佟明达过去讲授“耐火材料工艺学”时，没有系统的教材，他听了专家讲课后，修改了教材，使它更加系统完整。佟明达说：在上学期苏联专家威吉光是讲义就给我们写了十五万字，这该是多么热情的帮助啊！苏联专家对青年教师业务水平的提高特别关怀，经常听助教讲课，提出改进意见。无机物工学教研室助教李绍芬讲授“硫酸”时，专家阿赫米托夫就经常帮助和鼓励他。专家们不但亲自帮助研究生提高思想和业务水平，还关心到他们的生活和休息。  （新华社）
