    Over 1,800 larger private industrial and commercial enterprises in Tianjin have rationally distributed their 1953 year-end surpluses, according to the "Measures for the Distribution of Year-End Surplus of Private Enterprises" formulated by the Tianjin Municipal People's Government in January of this year. Other smaller private industrial and commercial enterprises have also distributed their 1953 year-end surpluses according to past practices.

    The work of distributing last year's year-end surplus by private enterprises in Tianjin began in January of this year. Due to the imperfect accounting systems of some enterprises, the final settlement of income tax was delayed, and the work was not completed until October. The "Measures for the Distribution of Year-End Surplus of Private Enterprises" formulated by the Tianjin Municipal People's Government distributes profits among four areas: national income tax, enterprise public reserve fund, employee welfare bonus, and investor dividends and bonuses. The distribution ratio varies according to the different profit rates of each enterprise. For enterprises with high profit rates, the proportion of public reserve funds was appropriately increased to take into account the needs of national production and construction and the needs of the private enterprises themselves. The result of this method of distribution avoids the past malady of most enterprises distributing the majority of profits to investors under the guise of year-end bonuses and gifts, leaving very little in public reserve funds, making it impossible to adapt to the needs of expanded production. Fifteen factories, including Fujuxing, extracted 2.05 billion yuan from last year's surplus of 7.4 billion yuan as public reserve funds to purchase machinery and equipment. Trading houses, hardware businesses, and other enterprises that did not need to expand their operations invested their public reserve funds in investment companies or industry to avoid idle funds or arbitrary spending.

    All larger enterprises have extracted employee welfare bonuses in proportion. Part of the welfare bonus is turned over to the district trade union, and part is given to the enterprise trade union to set up collective welfare undertakings such as nurseries and bathhouses. The Tianjin Municipal First, Second, and Fifth District Trade Union Offices have now used the enterprise welfare bonuses turned over by enterprises in their respective districts to establish employee clinics.

    This year, capitalists have also obtained reasonable profits. Fifteen factories, including Fujuxing Machinery Factory and Daxin Textile Dyeing Factory, had a surplus of over 7.4 billion yuan last year, and investors received a total of 1.54 billion yuan in dividends and bonuses, accounting for 20.78% of the total surplus. After appropriately increasing the public reserve funds of 22 enterprises with high profit rates, such as Chengxing Tea House and Huian Trading Company, the profit obtained by investors was still more than three times the social average profit rate. Many capitalists have expressed satisfaction with this approach.

### 天津市私营企业分配一九五三年年终盈余

    天津市私营企业分配一九五三年年终盈余
    天津市一千八百多户较大的私营工商业户，根据天津市人民政府今年一月制定的私营企业年终盈余分配办法，已将一九五三年年终盈余合理分配完毕。其他规模小的私营工商业户也都按旧例把一九五三年年终盈余作了分配。
    天津市私营企业分配去年年终盈余的工作是今年一月开始的。因为部分企业会计制度不健全，所得税汇算清交工作延长了时间，到十月份才全部结束。天津市人民政府制定的私营企业年终盈余分配办法，是按国家所得税、企业公积金、职工福利奖金、资方股息红利四个方面进行分配的。分配比例按照各企业的利润率不同而有所不同。利润率高的企业，为照顾国家生产建设和私营企业本身的需要，适当提高了公积金所占的比例。按这个办法分配的结果，避免了过去大部分企业的利润被资方用年终花红、馈送等名目进行分配，很少留有公积金，以致不能适应扩大生产需要的弊病，较大的企业普遍增加了企业的内部积累。福聚兴等十五个工厂在去年盈余的七十四亿多元中，提取二十亿五千万元作为公积金，添置机器设备。贸易行、五金商业等一些没有必要扩充经营的企业，为了不使公积金闲置起来或任意耗费掉，就把公积金投入投资公司或工业。
    各较大的企业都按比例提取了职工福利奖金。福利奖金的一部分上缴区工会，一部分归本企业工会开设托儿所、浴室等集体福利事业。现在天津市一、二、五区工会办事处就用本区各企业上缴的企业福利奖金，分别设立了职工诊疗所。
    今年，资本家也得到了合理利润。福聚兴机器厂、大新织染厂等十五个工厂去年盈余七十四亿多元，资方共分得股息红利十五亿四千万元，占盈余总额的百分之二十点七八。成兴茶庄、惠安贸易行等二十二个利润率高的企业在适当多提些公积金后，资方得的利润其比率仍超过社会平均利润率三倍多。许多资本家对这个办法表示满意。
