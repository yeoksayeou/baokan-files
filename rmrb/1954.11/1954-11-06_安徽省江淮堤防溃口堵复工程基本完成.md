The basic completion of the Anhui Province's Yangtze River and Huai River main and tributary dike breach closure project. In order to enable disaster victims to rebuild their homes and resume production as soon as possible, the Party committees and governments at all levels along the Yangtze and Huai Rivers in the province began to arrange for breach closure work as early as August, established organizations at each level, transferred a large number of materials, organized a large labor force, and launched projects to urgently close the breaches. After more than a month of emergency closure, by the end of October, all breaches in the Huai River and planned closures in the Yangtze River had been basically closed.

　　In the process of urgently closing the breaches, all localities generally attached importance to the pre-construction survey work, following the principle of "less money spent, greater benefits." Before the urgent closure of the Yangtze River dike breaches, they were generally surveyed more than three times, and the engineering plan was repeatedly revised. The closure project of the Chengdong Han Dike in Dangtu County initially required 400 million yuan in closure expenses and five days. After repeated surveys, it was completed with only 12 million yuan and one and a half days. When the Anqing Special District was rushing to close the Yangtze River dike breaches, it used bamboo baskets and straw bales instead of sacks and grass bags, and bamboo strips and grass ropes instead of lead wires, which not only saved the state a large amount of expenses, but also solved the difficulty of insufficient raw materials. After the completion of the breach closure project, the water level in the inner dike quickly dropped, and large areas of farmland were exposed every day. After the completion of the Tongle Han Dike closure in Guichi County, more than 7,000 mu were reclaimed by the end of October in Wusha Town and Bao'an Township alone, and more than 480 disaster-stricken households had returned to their hometowns to resume production. Most of the water accumulated in the Guanzhuang Han Dike has receded, and 100,000 mu of fields can be planted with wheat and other summer crops in advance.

    安徽省江淮堤防溃口堵复工程基本完成
    安徽省境内长江、淮河干支流堤防溃口堵复工程基本完成。为了使灾民早日重建家园、恢复生产，该省沿江、淮各级党委和政府早在八月份即开始布置堵口工作，并逐级建立机构，调运了大批器材，组织大批劳动力，开展抢堵溃口工程。经过一个多月的抢堵，到十月底，淮河全部溃口和计划抢堵的长江溃口已基本堵复。
    各地在抢堵溃口当中，都根据“花钱少，收益大”的原则，普遍重视了施工前的勘测工作。沿江堤防溃口在抢堵前，一般都勘测了三次以上，反复修改了工程计划。当涂城东垾圩的堵口工程，第一次勘查需要堵口经费四亿元和五天时间，经过反复勘测以后，只花了一千二百万元和一天半时间就堵好了。安庆专区在抢堵江堤溃口时，利用竹篓、草捆代替麻袋、草袋，用竹篾、草绳代替铅丝，既替国家节省下大批经费，又解决了原材料不足的困难。溃口堵复工程完成后，内圩水位迅速下降，每天都有大片农田露出水面。贵池县同乐圩堵口完工后，仅乌沙镇和保安乡两处地方，十月底即退出七千多亩，已有四百八十多户灾民回乡生产。官庄圩圩内积水已大部分退出，有十万亩田地可提前种上小麦和其他午季作物。
