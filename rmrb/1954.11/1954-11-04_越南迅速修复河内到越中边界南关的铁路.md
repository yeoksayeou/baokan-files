Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 3rd: The 150-kilometer railway between Hanoi and Nanguan (on the Vietnamese-Chinese border) is being rapidly repaired. This work began on October 22nd, twelve days after the liberation of Hanoi. Currently, trains have reached An Vien in Bac Ninh Province. Thousands of workers have gathered at construction sites along the line. On October 26th, the first batch of bamboo rafts carrying sleepers and rails was transported from Yen Bai and Phu Tho along the Red River to support the repair work. Repairs on the largest bridge on the railway line in the Phu Luong Thuong area are also being actively prepared.

The Vietnam General Confederation of Labor pointed out in a letter to all construction workers: The work of repairing the Hanoi-Nanguan railway line is one of the first important construction projects. It will facilitate transportation, help restore production, and develop the activities of Vietnam's various economic sectors, thereby strengthening the Vietnamese people's strength in the struggle to consolidate peace, achieve unification, and make the country independent and democratic. The repair of the railway will also help enhance the friendship and economic and cultural relations between Vietnam and fraternal countries.

In order to accelerate the repair work, the people of Lang Son Province have launched a competition campaign. They have set a goal of producing 55,000 sleepers, 2,000 tons of wood, and other materials. To achieve this goal, 9,000 people in Lang Son have volunteered to work at various construction sites for two months.

Farmers in Vinh Phuc Province actively responded to the call to repair the railway. In Viet Hung village, where twenty people were needed to participate in the work, one hundred and twenty people signed up.

People from all over enthusiastically donated construction equipment to the government. According to incomplete statistics, in October, the people of various provinces in the Viet Bac Interzone had donated more than 100,000 sleepers, 30,000 rails, and a large amount of scrap iron, including screws and iron telephone poles, worth several hundred million Vietnamese dong to the government. A farmer in Tan Thinh Village, Bac Giang Province, told cadres: During the war of resistance, we moved the railway sleepers to build secret trenches in order to fight the invaders. Now that peace has been restored, we will take out these scraps of iron and hand them over to the government to repair the railway and save the country's money.

    越南迅速修复河内到越中边界南关的铁路
    【新华社三日讯】据越南通讯社河内一日讯：河内——南关（在越中边界）之间长一百五十公里的铁路，正在迅速修复中。这个工作是从十月二十二日即河内解放后的十二天开始的。目前，火车已通到北宁省的安员。成千上万的工人已向线路上的各建筑工地集合。十月二十六日，装载枕木和铁轨的第一批竹排，从安沛和富寿沿着红河运下来支援修复工作。在府谅商地方的铁路线上最大的一座桥梁的修复工作，也在积极准备中。
    越南总工会在写给全体修建人员的信里指出：修复河内—南关铁路线的工作是第一批重要建设工程之一。它将便利交通运输，帮助生产的恢复和越南各经济部门活动的发展，从而加强越南人民在巩固和平、实现统一和使全国获得独立民主的斗争中的力量。铁路的修复也有助于增进越南和兄弟国家之间的友谊和经济、文化关系。
    为了加速修复工作，谅山省人民已展开竞赛运动。他们订出目标，要制作五万五千根枕木、两千吨木材和其他物资。为了完成这一目标，谅山有九千人自愿在各个建设工地工作两个月。
    永福省农民积极响应修复铁路的号召。在越兴村，需要二十个人参加工作，但有一百二十人报名。
    各地人民热情地把修建器材献给政府。据不完全统计，在十月间，越北联区各省人民已经献给政府十万多根枕木，三万条铁轨，以及大批碎铁，包括螺丝钉、铁的电线杆等，共值好几亿越币。北江省新盛村的一位农民对干部说：在抗战时期，我们把铁路枕木搬走，用来建筑秘密的壕沟，以便和侵略者作战，现在和平已经恢复，我们要把这些碎铁拿出来交给政府，好修复铁路和节省国家金钱。
