Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, November 17th: TASS reports that the government of the People's Republic of Poland, in accordance with the attitude it expressed during consultations with the Soviet government regarding the convening of a meeting on November 29th to discuss European collective security issues, issued a statement believing that the Soviet proposal for a pan-European conference creates a genuine opportunity to resolve issues related to the peaceful settlement of the German question and the strengthening of peaceful international cooperation.

    The statement first points out: Like the people of all European countries, Poland recognizes the threat contained in the London and Paris Agreements. The Polish people, who suffered tremendous losses of life, material wealth, and cultural treasures at the hands of the Hitlerian occupiers, cannot passively sit by and watch the revival of aggressive German militarism.

    The statement then points out: The government of the People's Republic of Poland has repeatedly contacted the major powers and the governments of countries bordering Germany in order to seek ways to ensure European security and peacefully resolve the German question. The government of the People's Republic of Poland has twice issued statements, on March 9th and August 8th this year, supporting the Soviet proposal for European collective security. The governments and parliaments of European countries must decide whether they are in favor of a peaceful resolution of European problems, and whether they can accept the proposal to convene a conference to discuss European collective security issues.

    The statement says: If, due to the ratification of the Paris Agreements, the plan to revive German militarism is realized, the government of the People's Republic of Poland will have to consider, together with other governments, taking measures to consolidate its national defense and security. The responsibility for creating this situation will fall entirely on those countries that made the revival of aggressive German militarism possible. The government of the People's Republic of Poland believes that the Soviet government's proposal, in its note, to convene a pan-European conference on November 29th to discuss European collective security issues creates a genuine opportunity to resolve issues related to the peaceful settlement of the German question and the strengthening of peaceful international cooperation.

    波兰政府发表声明支持苏联建议
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社华沙十七日讯：波兰人民共和国政府根据它和苏联政府就在十一月二十九日召开讨论欧洲集体安全问题会议一事举行的商谈中所表示的态度发表声明，认为苏联关于全欧会议的建议创造了解决有关和平解决德国问题和加强和平的国际合作的真正机会。
    声明首先指出：和一切欧洲国家的人民一样，波兰认识到伦敦和巴黎协定所包含的威胁。在希特勒占领者手中遭受过巨大的生命、物质及文化财富的损失的波兰人民，不能消极地坐视侵略性的德国军国主义的复活。
    声明接着指出：波兰人民共和国政府曾不止一次地同各大国以及和德国接壤的各国政府接触，以便寻求保证欧洲安全和和平解决德国问题的方法。波兰人民共和国政府曾经在今年三月九日和八月八日两度发表声明，支持苏联提出的欧洲集体安全的主张。欧洲各国的政府和议会必须决定它们是否赞成和平解决欧洲问题，决定它们是否能够接受关于召开一个讨论欧洲集体安全问题的会议的建议。
    声明说：如果由于巴黎协定被批准，复活德国军国主义的计划实现了，波兰人民共和国政府将不得不和其他政府一起考虑采取巩固它的国防和安全的措施的问题。造成这种局势的责任将完全由那些使得侵略性的德国军国主义的复活成为可能的国家来担负。波兰人民共和国政府认为，苏联政府在照会中提出的在十一月二十九日召开讨论欧洲集体安全问题的全欧会议的建议，创造了解决有关和平解决德国问题和加强和平的国际合作的真正机会。
