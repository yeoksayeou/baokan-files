Opposing the Continued Retention of the Chiang Kai-shek Bandit Gang's "Representatives" by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
Tan Wenrui

Under the instigation and coercion of the United States, the Ninth Session of the United Nations General Assembly illegally decided on September 21st to postpone the consideration of the issue of restoring the People's Republic of China's rights in the United Nations. Regarding the issue of China's representation in the United Nations, Premier Zhou, in his government work report to the First National People's Congress, pointed out that "the international aggressive bloc headed by the United States has consistently been hostile to our country, and despite world opinion and the opposition of many national governments, it still stubbornly and unreasonably deprives our country of its legitimate status and rights in the United Nations," and believes that "in order to further ease international tensions, to eliminate the threat of war, and to safeguard world peace, the People's Republic of China's legitimate status and rights in the United Nations must be restored." However, now the United States is once again using its old tricks at the Eighth Session of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization's General Conference, a specialized agency of the United Nations, to instigate and coerce the passage of a motion not to discuss the issue of expelling the "representatives" of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique at this session, in an attempt to continue to allow the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique's "representatives" to usurp China's seat.

The Eighth Session of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization's General Conference opened on November 12th in Montevideo, Uruguay. The Soviet Union recently joined this organization and sent a delegation to attend this meeting. At the meeting, the Soviet delegation proposed expelling the "representatives" of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. However, the conference, under the control of the United States, rejected the Soviet delegation's proposal. This decision of the General Conference is another manifestation of succumbing to the United States' policy of hostility towards the People's Republic of China, and the Chinese people cannot but express their firm opposition to this.

As early as May 12, 1950, China's Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai sent a telegram to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the Director-General of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, declaring that the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China is the only legal government representing the Chinese people, and that the so-called "representatives" of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique are completely unqualified to participate in this organization and must be expelled from its various institutions and meetings. This just demand of the Chinese people must not be ignored. In the past, the delegations of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, India, Burma, Yugoslavia and other countries to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization have repeatedly advocated correctly resolving the issue of China's representation. However, due to the coercion of the United States government, this organization has been dragging its feet for several years and has not taken proper measures, allowing the "representatives" of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to occupy China's seat. Everyone knows that after the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique was driven out of the mainland by the Chinese people, it has become increasingly rampant in conducting pirate activities under the protection of the United States, undermining the safety and freedom of navigation on the high seas. This behavior has proven to the people of the world that the Chiang Kai-shek clique is a mortal enemy of international cooperation and peace. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization is one of the specialized agencies of the United Nations. According to the organization's charter, its purpose should be "to advance the peace and security by promoting collaboration among the nations through education, science and culture." The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization's retention of the "representatives" of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is not only completely contrary to the wishes of the Chinese people, but can only damage its international prestige. All countries willing to promote international cooperation cannot agree to this. In order to implement its purpose, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization must expel the representatives of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique.

    反对联合国教育科学及文化组织继续容留蒋贼“代表”
    谭文瑞
    在美国动议和挟持下，第九届联合国大会于九月二十一日非法决定延期审查恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的权利问题。关于我国在联合国组织中的代表权问题，周总理在向第一届全国人民代表大会上所作的政府工作报告中已指出：“以美国为首的国际侵略集团却一直敌视我国，并且不顾世界舆论和许多国家政府的反对，至今仍然蛮横无理地剥夺我国在联合国中的合法地位和权利”，并认为，“为了进一步缓和国际紧张局势，为了消除战争威胁和保障世界和平，中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法地位和权利必须恢复”。可是现在，美国竟再一次地在联合国专门机构之一——联合国教育科学及文化组织大会第八届会议上，使用惯技，动议和挟持通过在本届会中不讨论驱逐蒋介石卖国集团“代表”问题，以图继续使蒋介石卖国集团“代表”僭据中国的席位。
    联合国教育科学及文化组织大会第八届会议是十一月十二日在乌拉圭的蒙得维的亚城开幕的。苏联不久以前参加了这个组织，并派遣了代表团出席这次会议。在会上苏联代表团建议将蒋介石卖国集团“代表”驱逐出联合国教育、科学及文化组织。但是会议在美国控制下竟否决了苏联代表团的建议。大会的这种决定，是再一次屈从美国敌视中华人民共和国的政策的表现，中国人民对此不能不表示坚决的反对。
    早在一九五○年五月十二日，我国周恩来外长就曾致电联合国秘书长及联合国教育、科学及文化组织总干事，声明中华人民共和国中央人民政府是代表中国人民的唯一合法政府，蒋介石卖国集团的所谓“代表”完全没有资格参加这一组织，必须将这些非法“代表”从它的各项机构和会议中驱逐出去。中国人民的这种正义要求，是决不容忽视的。过去波、捷、匈、印度、缅甸、南斯拉夫等国在联合国教育、科学及文化组织中的代表团就曾一再主张正确地解决中国代表权问题。但是由于美国政府的挟持以致这一组织几年来一直拖延不采取正当的措施，而让蒋介石卖国集团“代表”窃踞中国的席位。谁都知道，蒋介石卖国集团被中国人民驱逐出大陆之后，在美国庇护下日益猖獗地进行海盗活动，破坏公海航行安全和自由，这种行为，已向全世界人民证明了蒋介石集团是国际合作和和平的死敌。联合国教育、科学及文化组织是联合国的专门机构之一。根据该组织约章，它的宗旨应该是“通过促进各国间教育、科学和文化的合作来增进和平与安全。”联合国教育、科学及文化组织容留蒋介石卖国集团的“代表”，不仅是完全违反中国人民的愿望，而且只能使它的国际威望受到损害。所有愿意促进国际合作的国家对此是不能同意的。联合国教育、科学及文化组织为了贯彻它的宗旨必须把蒋介石卖国集团的代表驱逐出去。
