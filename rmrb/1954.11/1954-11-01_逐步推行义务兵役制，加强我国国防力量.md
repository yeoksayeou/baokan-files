    Gradually Implement Compulsory Military Service to Strengthen China's National Defense
  　In order to replenish the vacancies of demobilized soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and gradually implement compulsory military service, the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government issued an order in September this year to conscript 450,000 new soldiers from male citizens aged 18 to 22 from November 1, 1954, to February 28, 1955, before the promulgation of the Military Service Law. The term of service is three years for the army, four years for the air force, and five years for the navy. Now, conscription work will soon begin in various places. This is the beginning of China's gradual transition from a voluntary military service system to a compulsory military service system, and it is also an important measure to strengthen China's national defense and accelerate China's modernization of national defense.
    As early as 1945, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in his work "On Coalition Government": "Without a people's army, the people will have nothing." In the past, the Chinese people relied on their own army to overthrow the rule of domestic and foreign reactionaries, and after the founding of the People's Republic of China, they defended the people's victory and the country's independence and security, and protected the restoration and development of the national economy. Now that our people's democratic dictatorship has been consolidated and socialist construction has begun, can we relax the construction of our national defense forces a little? Absolutely not.
    We love peace, and the purpose of China's national defense construction is only to defend the integrity of our country's territory and maintain peace and security. Now our territory of Taiwan has not yet been liberated. The heinous Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, under the instigation and assistance of the US imperialist group, is rampantly attacking our coastal islands, bombing our coastal cities, plundering our coastal fishermen, robbing Chinese merchant ships and merchant ships of various countries trading with China, and sending large numbers of special agents and spies to sneak into mainland China to carry out various sabotage activities. They persecute and plunder 12 million overseas Chinese, lure and threaten the children of overseas Chinese to serve as cannon fodder, and step up the expansion of their army, clamoring to counterattack the mainland, attempting to provoke Asian and world wars in order to restore their bloody rule on the mainland. The US imperialist group is also establishing naval and air bases everywhere in the Pacific region, threatening and further invading China. After the successive ceasefires in Korea and Indochina, the ambitions of this aggressive group have not died. They still attempt to use Taiwan as a springboard for attacking mainland China, and have organized the so-called "Southeast Asia Defense Group" by means of threats and inducements, and are also plotting to organize the so-called "Northeast Asia Defense Alliance," attempting to establish a crescent-shaped military encirclement from South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, all the way to Pakistan, in order to achieve its sinister purpose of attacking China. Therefore, Premier Zhou Enlai said in his government work report at the First Session of the First National People's Congress: "In order to protect our national construction from sabotage, we must strive to strengthen our national defense. When countries openly hostile to the People's Republic of China are frantically expanding their armaments and intensifying threats to our country's security, we must have a strong and modern national defense force. That is to say, we must have a strong army, air force and navy sufficient to defend the integrity of our territory, airspace and territorial waters from encroachment." To build a strong and modern army, air force and navy, we must gradually implement compulsory military service.
    In the past, during the domestic revolutionary war, we had to implement a voluntary military service system due to various conditions. Although we have achieved the great victory of the people's revolutionary war because our troops have a high level of political consciousness and the support and support of the broad masses of people; it must also be seen that this system has many shortcomings and can only be a transitional system: First, this system is based on the voluntary participation of a part of the people in the army and long-term service, while the vast majority of people do not have the obligation to serve in the military. This makes it impossible for the country to have a trained reserve force, which is essential for any independent sovereign state. Second, the country's lack of trained reserves cannot reduce the number of standing troops to save financial expenses, and it also affects the rational solution of the living and welfare problems of the standing troops. Third, soldiers who volunteer to join the army do not have a fixed term of service, and a series of issues such as their marriage and family cannot be reasonably resolved. Therefore, continuing to implement the voluntary military service system can no longer meet the needs of consolidating national defense and carrying out socialist construction.
    After the implementation of the compulsory military service system, these problems can be gradually and reasonably resolved. First of all, Chinese citizens can fulfill their glorious obligations to serve in the military and defend the motherland in accordance with the law, and learn and master modern military knowledge and skills, so that our country can gradually cultivate a large number of well-trained reserve forces. Once imperialism destroys peace and launches a war of aggression against our country, our country can quickly conscript troops to rush to the post of defending the motherland to eliminate the enemy.
    Secondly, during their service period, every young person can not only learn military skills, but also quickly improve their political consciousness, cultural and scientific level, strengthen their physique, and be trained in organization and discipline in the People's Liberation Army, a great school; after their term expires and they are demobilized, they can become activists on all fronts of national construction.
    Thirdly, after the implementation of the compulsory military service system, the state has a large number of people who can master modern military equipment and military knowledge, and can usually reduce the number of standing troops in a planned way, thus greatly reducing the state's military expenditure and investing more funds in economic construction, which is of great benefit to the lives of every family in our country and to the cause of socialist construction.
    Finally, because military service has a certain term and is not long, the marriage and family issues of active-duty soldiers will not be affected. After demobilization, they are not too old, and it is easier to learn other professional skills, so the problem of resettlement and employment is also easier to solve.
    Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, with the victory of various social reforms and political movements, the people's level of awareness has been generally improved, especially after the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, the broad masses of people have been universally and deeply educated in patriotism, internationalism, and revolutionary heroism; in addition, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has a glorious tradition of unity between officers and soldiers and unity between the army and the people, and the broad masses of people have a deep feeling for our army. Therefore, in recent years, especially after the promulgation of China's Constitution, many children of the working people have voluntarily requested to serve in the military and learn military skills to defend the motherland. This fully shows that the implementation of the compulsory military service system is not only an urgent requirement for national defense construction and economic construction, but has also become an urgent requirement of the people. The conditions for implementing this advanced system are now fully ripe.
    Of course, it should also be seen that although the compulsory military service system is the most superior and reasonable system, it is still the first time it has been implemented in our country, and the people cannot fully familiarize themselves with and fully correctly understand this system all at once; coupled with the rumors and sabotage of hidden counter-revolutionary elements, this makes it inevitable that we will encounter some difficulties at the beginning of implementing this system. Therefore, the Party committees at all levels must carry out extensive and in-depth publicity and education work to make the Chinese people universally understand Article 103 of the Constitution, which stipulates that "Defending the motherland is the sacred duty of every citizen of the People's Republic of China. Serving in the military in accordance with the law is the glorious obligation of citizens of the People's Republic of China," and universally understand the specific practices and benefits of the compulsory military service system. No one should think that since the compulsory military service system is being implemented and everyone has the obligation to serve in the military, we can simply act by issuing commands without doing patient publicity and education work. Any simple, hasty, and coercive methods must be prevented.
    The policy of postponing conscription for the only breadwinner in the family and the only child must be strictly implemented. If deviations occur in the implementation, it will not only affect the people's trust in policies and laws, but also affect the people's lives and economic construction.
    Education must also be carried out in the People's Liberation Army to make active-duty soldiers realize that although this system is advanced and reasonable, it is the beginning of a new construction and must be gradually promoted and gradually realized over a considerable period of time, and cannot be a "big shift" all at once. Therefore, active-duty soldiers must work hard to learn military skills and continue to improve themselves as in the past, and should not slacken their fighting will and combat readiness.
    In order to smoothly complete this conscription work and make a good start for the implementation of the compulsory military service system in the future, the military service work must be carried out under the unified leadership of the local Party committees. All major issues related to military service, such as policies, guidelines, tasks, and time arrangements, must be appropriately arranged by the local Party committees based on the specific circumstances of the local area at the time. The Party committees in various places should not only specifically lead the military service cadres to carry out this work, but also mobilize all forces to assist in the completion of this work.
    The Chinese people have a glorious tradition of patriotism and people's heroism. In the past people's revolutionary war, although the voluntary military service system was implemented and there was no fixed term of service, the broad masses of young people were still able to actively join the army; now that the compulsory military service system has begun to be implemented and there is a fixed term of service, the Chinese people will certainly be able to respond more actively to the call of the motherland and consciously and voluntarily sign up for enlistment. In order to strengthen the struggle to liberate Taiwan, in order to strive for a happier tomorrow, and in order to defend the socialist construction of the motherland and the sacred territory and sovereignty of the motherland, young people of the new era, bravely step onto the sacred post of defending the motherland!

### 逐步推行义务兵役制，加强我国国防力量

    逐步推行义务兵役制，加强我国国防力量
  　为了补充人民解放军退伍兵员的缺额，并逐步推行义务兵役制，今年九月中央人民政府政务院发布了征集补充兵员的命令，要求在兵役法未颁布以前，从一九五四年十一月一日到一九五五年二月二十八日，在年满十八周岁到二十二周岁的男性公民中征集补充兵员四十五万人，服役期限为陆军三年，空军四年，海军五年。现在各地即将开始进行征集工作。这是我国志愿兵役制逐步过渡到义务兵役制的开始，也是加强我国国防力量和加速我国现代化国防建设的重要措施。
    毛泽东同志早在一九四五年所著“论联合政府”中就指示我们：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”在过去，我国人民依靠人民自己的军队，推翻了国内外反动势力的统治，又在中华人民共和国成立以后保卫了人民的胜利和国家的独立和安全，保卫了国民经济的恢复和发展。现在，我们的人民民主专政已经巩固，并且已经开始了社会主义的建设。这时候我们是不是可以稍为放松一些国防力量的建设呢？绝对不可以。
    我们是热爱和平的，我国的国防建设的目的只是为了保卫祖国的领土完整，维护和平与安全。现在我国的领土台湾还没有解放，万恶的蒋介石卖国集团还在美国侵略集团指使和援助下，猖狂地袭击我沿海岛屿，轰炸我沿海城市，劫掠我沿海渔民，打劫我国商船和同我国进行贸易的各国商船；大量派遣特务间谍潜入我国大陆进行各种破坏活动，对一千二百万海外华侨实行迫害和掠夺，诱骗和威胁华侨的子弟充当炮灰，并且加紧扩充军队，叫嚣反攻大陆，企图挑起亚洲和世界战争，以恢复他们在大陆上的血腥统治。美国侵略集团也在太平洋区域到处建立海空军基地，对我国实行威胁和进一步的侵略。朝鲜和印度支那相继停战以后，这个侵略集团的野心并没有死，他们仍然企图把台湾作为进攻我国大陆的跳板，并且以威胁利诱的手段组织了所谓“东南亚防务集团”，还阴谋组织所谓“东北亚防御联盟”，企图建立一条从南朝鲜、日本、台湾、泰国一直到巴基斯坦的新月形军事包围圈，以实现它进攻我国的罪恶目的。所以周恩来总理在第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上所作的政府工作报告中说：“为了保卫我们的国家建设事业不受破坏，还必须努力加强我们的国防。当公开敌视中华人民共和国的国家疯狂地扩张军备并且加紧威胁我国的安全的时候，我们不能不有强大的现代化的国防力量。这就是说，要有足以保卫我国领土完整、领空领海不受侵犯的强大的陆军、空军和海军。”而要建立强大的现代化的陆军、空军和海军，我们就必须逐步实行义务兵役制。
    在过去国内革命战争时期，限于各种条件，我们曾经不得不实行志愿兵役制。虽然因为我们部队人员的政治觉悟高，有广大群众的支持和拥护，因而取得了人民革命战争的伟大胜利；但也必须看到，这种制度是有许多缺点的，它只能是一种过渡性质的制度：第一、这种制度是由一部分人自愿参军，长期服役，而绝大多数人却没有服兵役的义务。这样就使国家不可能有经过训练的后备兵源，而这种兵源却是任何一个独立的主权国家所必须有的。第二、国家没有经过训练的后备兵源，就不能减少常备兵的数量以节省财政开支，而且也影响常备兵生活待遇问题的合理解决。第三、自愿参军的士兵没有一定的服役期限，他们的婚姻和家庭等一系列的问题也都不能合理地得到解决。因此，继续实行志愿兵役制，已经不能适应于巩固国防和进行社会主义建设的需要了。
    实行义务兵役制以后，这些问题都可以逐渐得到合理的解决。首先，我国的公民都可以依照法律去尽自己服兵役和保卫祖国的光荣义务，学习和掌握现代化的军事知识和技能，我们国家就可以逐渐培养出大量的训练有素的后备兵源。一旦帝国主义破坏和平，向我国发动侵略战争，我们国家就可以迅速征集部队奔赴保卫祖国的岗位去消灭敌人。
    其次，每个青年在服役期间，不仅可以学习军事技能，而且可以在人民解放军这样一个大学校里，很快地提高自己的政治觉悟和文化科学水平，增强体质，并且受到组织性和纪律性的锻炼；在期满退伍以后，又可以成为国家建设的各个战线上的积极分子。
    再其次，实行义务兵役制以后，国家因为有了大量的能够掌握现代军事装备和军事知识的人，平时就可以把常备兵的数量有计划地缩减，因而也就可以大量缩减国家的军费开支，把更多的经费投入经济建设，这对我国每一个家庭的生活和社会主义建设事业都有很大利益。
    最后，因为服兵役有一定年限，而且不长，所以现役军人的婚姻和家庭等问题都不会受到影响。退伍以后年龄不大，学习其他职业技能也比较容易，所以复员就业的问题也容易解决。
    中华人民共和国成立以来，随着各种社会改革和政治运动的胜利，人民的觉悟程度已经普遍提高，特别是经过抗美援朝运动，广大人民群众普遍而深刻地受到了爱国主义、国际主义和革命英雄主义的教育；加以中国人民解放军有官兵团结和军民团结的光荣传统，广大人民群众对我们的军队有深厚的感情，所以近年来，特别是我国宪法颁布以后，就有不少劳动人民的子弟自动要求服兵役，学习保卫祖国的军事技能。这充分说明：实行义务兵役制不仅是国防建设和经济建设的迫切要求，而且也已经成为人民群众的迫切要求。实行这一先进制度的条件，现在是完全成熟了。
    当然也应该看到：义务兵役制虽然是最优越最合理的制度，但在我国实行还是初次，人民群众还不能一下子完全熟悉并且完全正确地认识这个制度；加以隐蔽的反革命分子的造谣和破坏，这就使得我们在实行这一制度的开始时期一定会碰到一些困难。因此，各级党委必须开展广泛而深入的宣传教育工作，使我国人民普遍了解宪法第一○三条所规定的“保卫祖国是中华人民共和国每一个公民的神圣职责。依照法律服兵役是中华人民共和国公民的光荣义务”，普遍了解义务兵役制的具体作法和好处。谁也不应该以为既然是实行义务兵役制，人人都有服兵役的义务，我们就可以用简单的命令行事，而不作耐心的宣传教育工作。任何简单草率的强制方式，都是必须防止的。
    家庭唯一劳动力和独生子缓征的政策，必须严格执行。执行中如果发生偏差，不仅会影响到人民对政策法令的信任，也会影响到人民的生活和经济建设。
    在人民解放军里也必须进行教育，使现役士兵认识这一制度虽然是先进的和合理的，但却是一个新建设的开始，必须在相当的时间内逐步推行，逐步实现，而不能一下子来个“大换班”。所以现役军人必须像过去一样努力学习军事技能，继续提高自己，而不应该松懈自己的战斗意志和战斗准备。
    为了顺利完成这一次的征集工作并为今后推行义务兵役制作一个良好的开端，兵役工作必须在地方党委的统一领导下进行。一切有关兵役的一切政策、方针、任务、时间安排等重大问题，必须由当地党委根据当地当时的各种具体情况来加以适当的安排。各地党委不只是应当具体领导兵役干部来进行这一工作，而且要动员各方面的力量来协助完成这一工作。
    我国人民有着光辉的爱国主义和人民英雄主义的传统。在过去人民革命战争中，虽然实行的是志愿兵役制，没有一定的服役期限，但广大青年仍能踊跃参军；现在开始推行义务兵役制，服役有了一定期限，我国人民一定能够更加积极响应祖国的召唤，自觉自动地报名应征。为了加强解放台湾的斗争，为了争取更幸福的明天，为了保卫祖国的社会主义建设和祖国神圣的领土和主权，新时代的青年们，勇敢地走上保卫祖国的神圣岗位去吧！
