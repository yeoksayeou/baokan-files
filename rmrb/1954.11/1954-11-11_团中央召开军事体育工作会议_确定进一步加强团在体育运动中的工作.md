    The Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League convened a military sports work conference from October 21st to 27th to discuss how to further strengthen the League's work in sports. The conference listened to the work report by Rong Gaotang, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, engaged in full discussion, exchanged experiences, and was finally summarized by Hu Yaobang, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League.

    The conference believes that under the care, attention, and leadership of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the Central People's Government, sports have made great progress in recent years. League organizations at all levels have done a lot of work in this area, demonstrating that the Youth League is an indispensable and important force in carrying out sports. The conference also pointed out that the League's current work in sports still falls far short of the needs of the vast majority of young people. This is mainly manifested in the fact that some League leading organs (including some provincial and municipal League committees) do not pay enough attention to sports work, lack leadership, and the regular work of the League Committee's military sports department has not been well established.

    The conference believes that sports are an important aspect related to facing the vast number of young people, uniting the vast number of young people, and caring for the comprehensive development of the vast number of young people. The Youth League must give it greater attention. Therefore, it has been determined that League committees at all levels must strengthen their regular guidance for sports work from the following aspects: First, actively organize mass, amateur, small-scale, and diverse sports activities and sports competitions. Such competition activities should become the League's regular and important work in sports activities. Second, discover, support, and cultivate sports activists among young people. Third, plan and systematically mobilize young people to do it themselves, and strive for the help of the state, society, and administration to open up some sports venues and increase sports equipment. Fourth, give calls, support, and help to solve the problem of sports venues for children and carry out sports activities for children. Fifth, use various methods to regularly carry out propaganda work on sports, publicizing the principles, tasks, purposes, and role of sports. Sixth, always pay attention to understanding and reflecting the situation in grassroots sports and actively put forward suggestions to relevant parties.

    The conference determined that the League committees of each province and city (including cities under provincial jurisdiction) must seize the establishment and improvement of the military sports department's institutions and work, and according to the actual needs of work development, equip a certain number of full-time cadres. The League's grassroots organizations must also establish military sports committees, under the unified leadership of the League committee, to carry out the League's specific work in sports.

    团中央召开军事体育工作会议
    确定进一步加强团在体育运动中的工作
    【新华社十日讯】中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会在十月二十一日到二十七日召开了军事体育工作会议，讨论如何进一步加强团在体育运动中的工作问题。会议听取了团中央书记处书记荣高棠的工作报告，经过充分讨论，并交流了经验，最后由团中央书记处书记胡耀邦作了总结。
    会议认为：几年来，在党中央、毛主席和中央人民政府的关怀、重视和领导下，体育运动是有很大发展的。各级团的组织在这一方面做了很多工作，显示了青年团是开展体育运动不可缺少的一支重要力量。会议同时指出：当前团在体育运动中的工作，还远赶不上广大青年群众的需要。这主要表现在有些团的领导机关（包括有些省、市以上的团委）对体育工作重视不够，缺乏领导，团委军事体育部的经常工作还没有很好地建立起来。
    会议认为：体育运动是关系着面向广大青年，团结广大青年和关心广大青年全面发展的一个重要方面。青年团必须给予更大的重视。因此，确定了各级团委必须从以下几个方面去加强自己对于体育工作的经常指导：一、积极组织群众性的、业余的、小型的、多种多样的体育活动和体育竞赛，这种竞赛活动应成为团在体育活动中经常的、重要的工作；二、发现、支持和培养青年群众中的体育积极分子；三、有计划、有步骤地发动青年群众自己动手，争取国家的、社会的、行政的帮助，开辟一些体育运动场所和增加体育设备；四、对解决少年儿童体育场所和开展少年儿童体育活动要给以呼吁、支持和帮助；五、运用各种方式方法经常地进行体育运动的宣传工作，宣传体育运动的方针、任务、目的和作用；六、经常注意了解和反映基层体育运动中的情况，并向有关方面积极地提出建议。
    会议确定：各省、市（包括省辖市）团委必须抓紧建立和健全军事体育部的机构和工作，根据工作发展的实际需要，配备一定数量的专职干部。团的基层组织也必须设立军事体育委员，在团委的统一领导下，进行团在体育运动中的具体工作。
