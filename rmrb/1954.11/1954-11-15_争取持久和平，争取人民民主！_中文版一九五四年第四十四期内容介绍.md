"For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" the organ of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties, Chinese edition, 1954, Issue 44, has been published.

This issue publishes an editorial entitled "For Peace and European Collective Security." The editorial points out: The German question is the focus of attention for people all over the world. Resolving this issue is of decisive significance for maintaining and consolidating peace and ensuring European security. However, recent facts show that the ruling groups of Western countries continue to adopt the policy of remilitarizing West Germany, indulging the mortal enemies of the European peoples – the German militarists and revanchists. This can be clearly seen from the results of the one-sided talks held by Western countries in London and Paris. The London and Paris agreements stipulate placing the remilitarized West Germany in the exclusive military bloc of the "Western European Union." In addition, West Germany is to be dragged into the North Atlantic bloc, making this military group even more aggressively. The editorial emphasizes: Anyone without prejudice can clearly see that the resolutions passed at the London and Paris conferences can only exacerbate international tensions. Since the Soviet government's note to the governments of France, Britain, and the United States on October 23 this year pointed out the only correct path to solving the German question and ensuring European security, the note has received a wide response from people from all walks of life around the world. People of all countries believe that launching a vigorous struggle to defeat the new conspiracy to revive German militarism and strive for a solution to the German question on the basis of peace and democracy is their most important and urgent task at present. Completing this task will consolidate European security and consolidate peace.

Important articles published in this issue include: "Strengthening United Action in the New Stage of the Struggle for Peace" by Maurice Thorez, General Secretary of the French Communist Party; "Strengthening Cooperation Among Democratic Forces in Finland" by Aimo Aaltonen, General Secretary of the Finnish Communist Party; "People's Romania Struggles to Improve Labor Productivity and Reduce Production Costs" by Gheorghe Stoica, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party and First Deputy Chairman of the Romanian Council of Ministers, etc.

Thorez's article points out: The French people's struggle against the Paris agreements, which aim primarily at rearming West Germany, has entered an important new stage. The French Communists will persist in the struggle until the united national forces defeat the Paris agreements as they defeated the "European Defense Community" treaty in the past. Our party's task is to unite with all peace advocates and move towards new victories. The unity of national forces depends on our efforts. The growing movement to win the united action of the working class is the main guarantee for the victory of our struggle. Every organization and every activist of our party must seize the opportunity and work unremittingly to win the united front of the working class and the unity of national democratic forces, so that the cause of peace will have every chance to achieve victory once again.

Aaltonen's article is a summary of the report he made at the Tenth Congress of the Finnish Communist Party. The article talks about the principles of the Finnish Communist Party in foreign policy, summarizes the economic development of Finland from temporary prosperity to depression, and points out the tasks of the Finnish Communist Party in strengthening cooperation with various domestic democratic forces. The article points out: In the struggle to win the unity of democratic forces, we mainly strive to establish the unity of the working class in factories and trade union movements. However, the Social Democratic Party and the working masses who support the Social Democratic Party are not our enemies. Our enemies are the enemies of the working class. Only by cooperating with the Social Democrats can we establish the great unity of the working people, including the non-party masses. The working class and the peasant class account for the vast majority of our country's population, so the unity of the working class and the alliance of workers and working peasants are the main factors in the cooperation of democratic forces.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五四年第四十四期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”一九五四年第四十四期中文版已经出版。
    本期以“为了和平和欧洲集体安全”为题发表社论。社论指出：德国问题是全世界人士注意的中心。解决这个问题对于维护并巩固和平和保障欧洲安全具有决定性的意义。但是，最近的事实表明，西方国家的统治集团继续采取使西德重新军国主义化的方针，放纵欧洲各国人民的死敌——德国的军国主义者和复仇主义者。这可以从西方国家在伦敦和巴黎举行片面性会谈的结果中很清楚地看出来。伦敦和巴黎的协定规定把重新军国主义化的西德放在“西欧联盟”这个排他性的军事集团里面。此外，还要把西德拖进北大西洋集团，使这一军事集团具有更严重的侵略性。社论着重指出：凡是不带偏见的人都可以清楚地看到，伦敦和巴黎会议所通过的决议只能加剧国际紧张局势。由于苏联政府今年十月二十三日致法、英、美三国政府的照会中指出了解决德国问题和保障欧洲安全的唯一正确的道路，所以照会获得了全世界各界人士的广泛响应。各国人民认为，展开有力的斗争，击败恢复德国军国主义的新阴谋，争取在和平和民主的基础上解决德国问题，是他们当前最重要和最迫切的任务。完成这一任务就能巩固欧洲的安全，就能巩固和平。
    本期刊载的重要文章有：法国共产党总书记多列士的“在和平斗争的新阶段中加强统一行动”，芬兰共产党总书记培西的“加强芬兰各民主力量的合作”，罗马尼亚工人党中央政治局委员、罗马尼亚部长会议第一副主席斯托伊卡的“人民罗马尼亚为提高劳动生产率和降低生产成本而奋斗”等。
    多列士的文章指出：法国人民反对以重新武装西德为主要目的的巴黎各项协定的斗争，已经开始进入了一个重要的新的阶段。法国共产党人将坚持斗争，直到团结起来的民族力量像过去击败“欧洲防务集团”条约那样击败巴黎协定。我们党的任务是同一切和平拥护者团结在一起向着新的胜利前进。民族力量的团结有赖于我们的努力。争取工人阶级统一行动的运动日益高涨，这就是我们的斗争能够取得胜利的主要保证。我们党的每一个组织，每一个活动分子都要抓紧时机，坚持不懈地工作，争取建立工人阶级的统一战线，争取民族民主力量的团结，这样，和平事业就完全有可能再一次取得胜利。
    培西的文章是他在芬兰共产党第十次代表大会上所作的报告的摘要。文章谈到了芬兰共产党在外交政策方面的原则，综述了芬兰的经济发展由暂时景气到萧条的情况，指出了芬兰共产党在同国内各民主力量加强合作中的任务。文章指出：我们在争取民主力量的团结斗争中，主要是努力在工厂和工会运动中建立工人阶级的团结。但是，社会民主党和支持社会民主党的劳动群众并不是我们的敌人。我们的敌人是工人阶级的敌人。只有同社会民主党人合作，我们才能建立劳动人民的大团结，包括无党派的群众在内。工人阶级和农民阶级占我国人口的绝大多数，因此工人阶级的团结以及工人和劳动农民的联盟是民主力量的合作的主要因素。
