    Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 30th: According to TASS, the United Nations General Assembly plenary session on the 29th unanimously adopted the resolution of the Special Political Committee on Burma's accusation of aggression by Kuomintang bandit gangs. The Kuomintang members did not participate in the vote.
    The resolution expresses regret over the fact that a considerable number of foreign troops with a large amount of weapons still remain within the territory of the Union of Burma. The resolution reiterates that these troops must be disarmed and detained. The resolution assures support for the efforts made by the Burmese government to finally resolve this issue, and urgently requests all countries to take all necessary steps to prevent the provision of any assistance that would enable foreign troops to remain in Burma or take hostile action against this country.

    联大全会通过缅甸控诉蒋匪侵略案的决议
    【新华社三十一日讯】据塔斯社纽约三十日讯：联合国大会全体会议二十九日一致通过了特别政治委员会关于缅甸控诉国民党匪帮侵略案的决议。国民党分子没有参加投票。
    这项决议对于拥有大量武器的、相当数目的外国军队目前仍然留在缅甸联邦境内这一事实表示遗憾。决议重申：这些部队必须解除武装并予以拘禁。决议保证支持缅甸政府为最后解决这个问题所作的努力，并迫切要求所有国家采取一切必要的步骤，来防止给予能使外国军队仍然留在缅甸境内或对这个国家采取敌对行动的任何援助。
