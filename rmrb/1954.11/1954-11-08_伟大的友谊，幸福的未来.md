    A large-scale grain farm with a sowing area of 20,000 hectares, fully equipped by the Soviet people, is being planned in the vast fertile land known as "Beidahuang" (Great Northern Wilderness) in Heilongjiang Province, China. Site surveying and planning design are already underway, and large-scale reclamation and partial sowing are expected to begin next year.

    This farm will be the largest state-owned farm in China. In addition to the area occupied by farm offices, staff dormitories, and repair shops, the sowing area alone will be 300,000 mu (approximately 20,000 hectares), equivalent to 800 square li (approximately 400 square kilometers), more than twice the area of urban Beijing. China's largest state-owned "September 3rd" Mechanical Farm currently has over 10,000 hectares of cultivated land, with the working area stretching out of sight. It takes several days to travel through each of its operating areas. The large-scale grain farm, when completed, will be almost twice the size of the "September 3rd" Farm.

    This farm is not only large in scale, but its equipment and level of mechanization are also unmatched by any existing state-owned mechanical farm in China. In 1953, the 59 state-owned mechanical farms across the country had a total of only over 800 tractors and over 300 combine harvesters. However, the Soviet people are gifting this large-scale farm nearly 200 tractors and combine harvesters of various types. In addition, there are various plows, harrows, seeders, cultivators, grain cleaning machines, mowers, and stackers. These machines are not only the latest models but also the most complete and comprehensive in variety. They will enable the entire farming process, from reclamation, tilling, and sowing to weeding, fertilizing, harvesting, threshing, and even stacking, to be fully mechanized. Once the entire farm is completed, it will become a modern agricultural town.

    Most Chinese farmers still cultivate using old plows, with one person and two animals cultivating at most four or five mu per day. Using a double-wheeled double-铧 (plowshare) plow, they can only cultivate ten to fifteen mu per day. It is difficult for Chinese farmers to imagine how much manpower and animal power these machines can replace. Taking the "C-80" crawler tractor as an example, it can cultivate over 400 mu per day in two shifts with two five-铧 (plowshare) plows. When used for land reclamation, it can reclaim approximately 300 mu per day. It would take hundreds of laborers and animals to do the same amount of work; however, with this machine, only a driver calmly controlling the machine panel and two agricultural implement operators are needed. The one hundred combine harvesters, known as "factories in the fields," can complete the processes of harvesting, cutting, and threshing in one go. Among them, six "C-4" models are the most advanced automatic combine harvesters recently produced in the Soviet Union. They do not require other mechanical traction, move forward freely at adjustable speeds, and can harvest over 300 mu of grain per day. The machines are also equipped with electric lights, so they can work normally at night if needed.

    Our friends have thought so carefully and thoroughly for us. While donating these machines, they also gifted a complete set of equipment for a repair shop, a power station, and various radio stations and communication and transportation tools such as cars and motorcycles. Farm managers can use these modern facilities to lead and direct such a large-scale production. In addition to the employees' intense labor, there are also mobile film projection facilities that can move to various operating areas to show movies and relieve fatigue.

    The establishment of this large-scale grain farm will become a university for us to learn how to manage socialist agricultural enterprises. In order to provide organizational and technical assistance to our construction and management of state-owned grain farms, the Soviet government has not only dispatched a land consolidation survey team to help with site surveying, design, and planning, but also sent a group of experts to help our staff master technology and management methods in a short period. Here, we will learn advanced mechanized production techniques and experience in organizing large-scale land reclamation together with Soviet experts. China's cultivated land area is insufficient, and agricultural production lags behind the needs of the country and the people. Although there are approximately 1.5 billion mu of reclaimable wasteland, it is impossible to adopt large-scale immigration methods to reclaim it due to various limitations. The best way to reclaim wasteland is to establish state-owned farms. After the completion of this large-scale grain farm, it will become a mature example for China to establish large-scale state-owned farms and reclaim wasteland in the future, and will set a good example for China to strengthen the operation and management of existing state-owned farms.

    The farm is being established in "Beidahuang" (Great Northern Wilderness), with excellent farming conditions and broad development prospects. How large is the wasteland here? There are no accurate statistics to date, but there are several large areas of wasteland suitable for reclamation, with millions of hectares connected in one piece. The large-scale farm to be built is the best of these large wastelands. This vast land stretches from Jiamusi in the west to the Songhua River in the north, the Wanda Mountains in the south, and the Ussuri River in the east. The arable area is over 2.7 million hectares. The climate here is good, with about 140 days of frost-free period each year and an annual rainfall of about 500 mm. The soil is the most fertile black calcium soil, with a black soil layer generally around one meter thick. It is suitable for planting wheat, soybeans, corn, etc. The area has a network of rivers and good water conservancy conditions.

    The vast and fertile "Beidahuang" (Great Northern Wilderness) holds unlimited production potential. For many years, the working people have dreamed of reclaiming it, but dreams are difficult to achieve with only cattle, horses, and old plows. It was not until after liberation, when the Communist Party and the People's Government learned from the example of Soviet state-owned farms, that dozens of state-owned farms were established here. After the completion of this large-scale grain farm equipped with the latest technology, the desolate appearance of "Beidahuang" (Great Northern Wilderness) will gradually change. The land that has been sleeping for thousands of years will be turned over, and the boundless weeds and wildflowers will gradually be replaced by lush crops.

    A few years ago, when we started to establish state-owned mechanical farms in the Northeast with the friendly concern and help of the Soviet Union, nearby farmers were delighted and ran a long way to visit the farms. I remember an old farmer who, when he saw a tractor plowing the land for the first time, looked at the unhurried driver with surprise and admiration, and then looked at the newly turned-over large area of land, and said with emotion: "I have lived such a long life, and this is the first time I have seen the difference between humans and animals!" This old farmer, who had been engaged in heavy physical labor all his life, began to see the happy prospects for Chinese farmers and began to realize the benefits of Sino-Soviet friendship to farmers. After the completion of this state-owned grain farm with the highest degree of mechanization and the largest scale, Chinese farmers will feel even more excited and encouraged by this great friendship, and will be more confident in moving towards a happy and bright future.

    伟大的友谊，幸福的未来
    于长钦　马新仁
    在我国黑龙江省境内，在人们一向称为“北大荒”的千里沃野上，一个由苏联人民赠送全部装备的拥有两万公顷播种面积的大型谷物农场正在开始筹建。现在场地勘测、规划设计等工作已着手进行，预计明年即可大规模开垦并部分地进行播种。
    这个农场将是我国现有国营农场中规模最大的一个。除农场办公室、职工宿舍、修理厂等建筑占地面积外，单是播种面积就有三十万市亩，约合八百平方里，比北京城区的面积大两倍多。我国目前最大的国营“九三”机械农场，耕地面积有一万多公顷，耕作区域一眼望不到边，要走遍它的每个作业区需要好几天；而这个大型谷物农场建成后，比
  “九三”农场差不多还要大一倍。
    这个农场不但规模大，它的设备和机械化程度也是我国现有国营机械农场所不能比拟的。一九五三年全国五十九处国营机械农场，总共才有拖拉机八百多台，联合收割机三百多台；而苏联人民这次赠送这个大型农场的机器，单是各式拖拉机、联合收割机就有近二百台。此外还有各式犁耙、播种机、耕耘机、净谷机、割草机、砌垛机等。这些机器不但式样最新，而且种类最齐全、最完备，它可以使农场的整个耕作过程，从开垦、耕耙、播种到除草、施肥、收割、脱谷以至堆垛等全部机械化。整个场子建成后，这里将成为一座现代化的农业城镇。
    我国农民现在绝大多数还是用旧犁耕作，一人两牲口，一天顶多耕四五亩；用双轮双铧犁，一天也只能耕十至十五亩。这些机器的效能究竟能顶多少人畜力呢？那是我国农民所难以想像的。单以“C—80”履带式拖拉机来说，它带上两个五铧犁，一天两班能耕地四百亩以上；用来开荒，一天约能开三百亩。如果要用人畜力来干，需要几百个劳动力和牲口才能干得出来；而这种机器只要一个驾驶员从容地掌握着机盘再配上两个农具手就可以了。被称为“田野上的工厂”的一百台联合收割机，能把收、割、打等过程统一起来一下完成。其中有六台“C—4”式，是苏联新近出产的最完善的自动联合收割机，它不需要别的机械牵引自行前进，快慢自如，一天能收三百多亩谷物。机器上还装有电灯，如果需要，夜晚也能照常工作。
    我们的友人为我们设想得这样细密和周到，在赠送这些机器的同时，还送给一个修理厂，一个发电站的全套装备，另外还有各式无线电台和汽车、摩托车等通讯和交通运输工具。农场的管理者可以利用这些现代化的设备来领导和指挥这样巨大规模的生产。在职工们紧张劳动之余，还有流动的电影放映设备，可以流动到各个作业区去放映电影，解除疲劳。
    这个大型的谷物农场的建立，将成为我们学习管理社会主义农业企业的大学校。苏联政府为了给我们建设和管理国营谷物农场以组织上和技术上的帮助，除了派遣一个土地整理考察组来帮助进行场地的勘测、设计、规划外，还派遣了一批专家来帮助我们的工作人员在短期间掌握技术和管理方法。在这里，我们将和苏联专家一起学会机械化生产的先进技术和组织大规模开荒的经验。我国耕地面积不足，农业生产落后于国家和人民的需要，虽有约十五亿亩的可垦荒地，但是由于种种条件的限制，不可能采用大规模移民的办法来开垦。开垦荒地的最好办法，就是创办国营农场。这个大型谷物农场建成后，将成为我国今后大规模创办国营农场开垦荒地创造成熟经验，并将为我国加强现有国营农场的经营管理树立一个良好的榜样。
    农场在“北大荒”建立，有着优良的耕作条件和广阔的发展前途。这里的荒地面积究竟有多大？至今没有精确的统计，百万公顷联成一片的适宜开垦的大片荒地就有好几处。将要兴建的这个大型农场是这些大块荒地中最好的一处。这一片广漠的土地，西起佳木斯，北至松花江，南到完达山，东至乌苏里江。可耕面积达二百七十万公顷以上。这里气候良好，每年约有一百四十多天无霜期，年降雨量约五百公厘左右；土壤是最肥沃的黑钙土，黑土层一般在一公尺左右；适宜种小麦、大豆、玉米等，区域内河道纵横，水利条件良好。
    广阔富饶的“北大荒”，蕴藏着无限的生产潜力。多少年来，劳动人民都梦想着开垦它，但只凭牛马和旧犁，梦想是难于实现的。直到解放后，共产党和人民政府学习苏联国营农场的榜样，才在这里建立了数十处国营农场。这个用最新技术装备的大型谷物农场建成后，将会使“北大荒”的荒凉面貌逐渐改观，千年酣睡的土地将被翻动起来，无边无际的荒草野花将逐渐为繁茂的庄稼所代替。
    几年前，当我们在苏联的友谊关怀和帮助下，在东北开始建立国营机械农场的时候，附近农民欢腾鼓舞，老远跑到农场去参观。记得有一个老农第
  一次看见拖拉机耕地的时候，他用惊奇而羡慕的眼光看着那个不慌不忙的驾驶手，又看看那新翻起的大片土地，感慨地说：“我活了这么大年纪，头一次看见了人和畜牲的分别！”这个从事了一辈子笨重的体力劳动的老农，从这里开始看到了中国农民的幸福的远景，也开始认识到中苏友谊对农民的好处。当这个机械化程度最高规模最大的国营谷物农场建成后，我国的农民将为这种伟大的友谊感到更大的兴奋和鼓舞，更加充满信心地走向幸福灿烂的未来。
