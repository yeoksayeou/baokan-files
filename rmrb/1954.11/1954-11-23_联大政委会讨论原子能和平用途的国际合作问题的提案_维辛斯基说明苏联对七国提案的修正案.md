Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 21st: The United Nations General Assembly's Political Committee discussed a proposal on international cooperation in the development of peaceful uses of atomic energy on the 18th and 19th.

    The sponsors of the seven-nation proposal made some revisions to their proposal. U.S. Representative Lodge, on behalf of the seven-nation delegation, introduced the revised proposal at the meeting on the 18th, and explained the substance of these revisions. Lodge stated that the proposing countries had taken into account the amendments proposed by the Soviet Union and the views of the Indian representative when making the revisions. He also said that the proposing countries could not agree to the Soviet amendment that stipulated that not only member states of the United Nations and specialized agencies should be invited to participate in the international conference on the peaceful application of atomic energy, but also all other countries willing to participate in the conference.

    Soviet Representative Vyshinsky then spoke to explain the Soviet amendments to the seven-nation proposal. Vyshinsky said that the Soviet amendments could improve the seven-nation proposal, so that after it becomes a resolution of the United Nations General Assembly, it could promote the dedication of atomic energy to the peaceful needs of mankind to a greater extent.

    Vyshinsky then described the substance of the Soviet amendments. The first Soviet amendment stated that the Assembly should strive to use all possible means to promote the use of major discoveries in atomic energy only for peaceful purposes. This amendment was reflected in the corresponding clause of the revised seven-nation proposal, which stated that the Assembly hopes to vigorously promote the use of atomic energy only for the peaceful purposes and improvement of living standards pursued by mankind.

    The second Soviet amendment stipulated that, in addition to stating that negotiations on the establishment of an international agency for the peaceful application of atomic energy are underway, the proposal should also suggest that these negotiations continue. This amendment is also reflected in the revised seven-nation proposal. After stating that the negotiations are underway, the revised seven-nation proposal mentioned the desire to continue these negotiations.

    At the suggestion of the Soviet Union, the proposing countries of the seven-nation proposal deleted the words "similar to the agreements of specialized agencies" from the original proposal regarding the relationship between the international agency and the United Nations. Vyshinsky said that this made the wording more acceptable than before, because in this way, it would be possible to negotiate the specific form of the agency's relationship with the United Nations in the future. The Soviet delegation also agreed to certain other revisions to the seven-nation proposal.

    The Soviet representative emphasized that the international conference on the peaceful application of atomic energy should welcome the participation of all countries, because this is of great principled significance.

    At the meeting on the 19th, the representatives of Czechoslovakia and Poland spoke in support of the amendment proposed by the Soviet delegation, stipulating that all countries willing to participate should participate in the international scientific conference discussing the peaceful application of atomic energy. The representative of Burma said that the Burmese delegation "sympathized with this amendment of the Soviet Union." The Swedish representative stated that his delegation was now able to vote in favor of the revised seven-nation proposal. Representatives from the Philippines, Yugoslavia, and other countries supported the revised seven-nation proposal.

    The Indian delegation put forward an amendment to the seven-nation proposal, which suggested that all countries currently negotiating the establishment of an international agency for the peaceful application of atomic energy should consult with other member states of the United Nations. The representatives of the United States and Britain said that if this amendment were adopted, it would complicate the negotiations and thus delay them.

    The Political Committee's discussion of the proposal will continue.

### 联大政委会讨论原子能和平用途的国际合作问题的提案  维辛斯基说明苏联对七国提案的修正案

    联大政委会讨论原子能和平用途的国际合作问题的提案
    维辛斯基说明苏联对七国提案的修正案
    【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会政治委员会在十八日、十九日讨论了关于在发展原子能和平用途方面的国际合作问题的提案。
    七国提案的提案国把它们的提案作了一些修改。美国代表洛奇在十八日会议上，代表七国代表团提出这个经过了修改的提案，并且发言解释这些修改的实质。洛奇表示，在进行修改时，各提案国已把苏联提出的修正案和印度代表的意见考虑进去了。他还说，各提案国不能同意苏联提出的这一点修正：规定不仅邀请联合国和各专门机构的成员国参加关于和平应用原子能问题的国际会议，还邀请所有其他愿意参加会议的国家参加。
    苏联代表维辛斯基接着发言说明苏联对七国提案所提出的修正案。维辛斯基说，苏联这些修正案能够改进七国提案，使它在变成联合国大会的决议以后，能够在更大程度上促进把原子能专用于人类和平需要的目的。
    维辛斯基接着叙述了苏联各项修正案的实质。苏联第一项修正案谈到大会要努力用一切可能的办法促进原子能方面的重大发现只用于和平用途。这一个修正案在七国的修正了的提案的相应条款中得到了反映，这个条款说：大会希望大力促进原子能只用于人类所追求的和平目的和提高生活水平。
    苏联的第二项修正案规定，提案除了说明关于建立和平应用原子能的国际机构的谈判正在进行外，还应当建议继续进行这一谈判。这一项修正案也反映在修正了的七国提案中了。修正了的七国提案在说明这一谈判正在进行之后，提到了继续进行这一谈判的意愿。
    七国提案的提案国，在苏联的建议下，从原来的提案中关于国际机构同联合国的关系的一款中，删去了“相仿于专门机构的协议”的字样。维辛斯基说，这就使措词比以前容易接受，因为，这样一来，就能够在将来来谈判这个机构同联合国的关系的具体形式了。苏联代表团也同意七国提案的某些其他的修改。
    苏联代表强调指出，关于原子能和平应用的国际会议应该欢迎一切国家参加，因为这是具有重大的原则意义的。
    在十九日会议上，捷克斯洛伐克和波兰的代表发言支持苏联代表团提出的、规定由一切愿意参加的国家参加讨论原子能和平应用的国际科学会议的修正案。缅甸代表说，缅甸代表团“同情苏联这个修正案”。瑞典代表表示，他的代表团现在能够投票赞成修正了的七国提案了。菲律宾、南斯拉夫等国代表支持修改了的七国提案。
    印度代表团对七国提案提出了一项修正案，其中建议：目前在谈判建立和平应用原子能的国际机构的所有国家，应该征询联合国其他会员国的意见。美国和英国的代表说，如果通过这一修正案，就将使谈判复杂化，因而拖延谈判。
    政治委员会对提案的讨论将继续进行。
