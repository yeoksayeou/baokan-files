    Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 15th—Farmers in the Tangshan and Zhangjiakou Special Districts of Hebei Province have a general increase in surplus grain. Although the harvest this year in Hebei Province as a whole is not considered good, the Tangshan and Zhangjiakou Special Districts in the north have generally experienced a bumper harvest. Fengrun and Luan counties are known as the granaries of eastern Hebei, and their surplus grain this year is about 40 percent higher than last year. The 176,000 farm households in Fengrun County have an average surplus of 570 *jin* of grain for sale per household. The five counties of Kangbao, Shangdu, Guyuan, Zhangbei, and Shangyi in the Zhangjiakou Special District have an average of over 1,900 *jin* of surplus grain per household. The agricultural production cooperatives have even more surplus grain. The 1,214 agricultural production cooperatives in the Zhangjiakou Special District have a per-unit area yield that exceeds that of local mutual aid teams and individual farmers by 10 to 20 percent, and their surplus grain is about 20 percent higher than last year. In Zhujiantuo Township, Funing County, 80 percent of the 446 farm households in the Bohai Agricultural Production Cooperative were grain-deficient households last year. This year, more than 90 percent of the cooperative's households have surplus grain, and can sell 1 million *jin* of surplus grain to the state, a figure equal to ten times the total amount of grain sold by the entire township last year.
    Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 15th—The 108 agricultural production cooperatives established in Horqin Right Wing Rear Banner before this spring have generally achieved bumper harvests. The agricultural production cooperative in Shengli Village, Fangchun Village, has only 22 member households. According to the cooperative's deputy director, Li Wanchun, the entire cooperative can harvest 750 *shi* (approximately 450 *jin* per *shi*) of grain, with an average of more than 34 *shi* per member household. The First Agricultural Production Cooperative in Zike Village, Third District, after actual measurement, can produce an average of 7 *shi* of grain per *gongqing*. The cooperative has 85 *gongqing* of cultivated land, for a total grain production of 595 *shi*, exceeding last year's (disaster-stricken) total output of the cooperative by more than 55 percent. According to preliminary understanding, 17 agricultural production cooperatives in the entire Horqin Right Wing Rear Banner have been found where each workday can distribute more than eight *sheng* of grain.

    【新华社保定十五日电】河北省唐山、张家口专区农民余粮普遍增多。虽然今年河北全省的年景不算好，但北部唐山、张家口专区粮食普遍丰收。丰润县和滦县有冀东粮仓的称号，这两个县今年的余粮约比去年增加百分之四十以上。丰润县十七万六千农户，平均每户有五百七十斤余粮出售。张家口专区康保、商都、沽源、张北、尚义五个县，平均每户有一千九百多斤余粮。其中农业生产合作社的余粮要多些。张家口专区有一千二百十四个农业生产合作社的单位面积产量超过了当地互助组和单干农民一成到二成，他们的余粮约比去年增加百分之二十以上。抚宁县朱建坨乡渤海农业生产合作社去年四百四十六户农民中有百分之八十是缺粮户。今年全社已有百分之九十以上的户有了余粮，可卖一百万斤余粮给国家，这个数字等于去年全乡卖粮总数的十倍。
    据新华社哈尔滨十五日电：黑龙江省郭后旗今年春天以前建立的一百零八个农业生产合作社普遍获得丰收。芳春村胜利屯的农业生产合作社只有二十二户社员，据这个社的副主任李万春估计，全社可收七百五十石（每石四百五十斤左右）粮食，平均每户社员可得三十四石多。三区自克村第一农业生产合作社经过实测，平均每垧地可产粮食七石。全社八十五垧耕地，总共可产粮食五百九十五石。超过去年（受灾）全社总产量百分之五十五以上。据初步了解：全郭后旗已发现有十七个农业生产合作社每个劳动日可分得粮食八升以上。
