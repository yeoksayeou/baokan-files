Shanghai's state-owned commercial system is taking active measures to strive to fulfill and overfulfill the commercial plan. Five specialized companies in Shanghai, including department stores, transportation and electrical equipment, specialized businesses, food, and petroleum, have completed their October sales plans; among them, the department store company completed 109.17 percent, the transportation and electrical equipment company completed 104.42 percent, and the food company completed 115.09 percent.

In October, Shanghai's state-owned commercial departments generally attached importance to the promotion of goods, and paid attention to overcoming the unreasonable phenomenon of "goods in warehouses, out of stock in stores." The Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of China Department Store Company adopted methods such as organizing specialized promotion groups and bringing goods face-to-face with purchasers, promoting goods worth more than 140 billion yuan. In addition to replenishing more than 160 kinds of commodities, the third wholesale department of the Shanghai Company of China Department Store Company took measures such as organizing promotion groups and holding commodity display halls to vigorously carry out promotion work. Paper, which had failed to complete its sales plan for nine months, overfulfilled its plan in October. Dark-colored, coarse woolen flannel, which the Shanghai Trading Trust Company had difficulty selling, was processed and tailored into bed blankets, which were loved by housewives and have now sold more than 90 percent of the inventory.

All employees of the Wuhan Company of China Department Store Company continued to improve business management and working methods in the increased production and economy movement in October, and comprehensively overfulfilled the national plan. The company completed 104.63 percent of the total sales plan (accounting for 35.9 percent of the fourth quarter plan), and completed 103.8 percent of the purchase plan; the completion rate of the profit plan increased by 1.5 percent compared with September, and the expense rate decreased by 0.37 percent compared with September.

In October, more than 90 percent of the employees of the Wuhan Department Store Company subscribed to personal production increase and economy plans, and earnestly implemented them. Retail units tried to improve commodity management methods, shortened closing times, reduced work errors, and effectively improved work efficiency.

    上海市国营商业部门争取完成销售计划
    武汉市百货公司全面完成十月份计划
    上海市国营商业系统正在采取积极措施，争取完成和超额完成商业计划。上海市百货、交通电工器材、专卖事业、食品、石油等五个专业公司已经完成了十月份的销售计划；其中百货公司完成百分之一百零九点一七，交通电工器材公司完成百分之一百零四点四二，食品公司完成百分之一百一十五点零九。
    十月份，上海市国营商业部门普遍重视了商品推销工作，注意克服了“仓库有货，门市脱销”的不合理现象。中国百货公司上海采购供应站采用组织推销专业小组、使商品和采购者见面等办法，推销商品值一千四百多亿元。中国百货公司上海市公司第三批发部除增补商品一百六十多种外，采取组织推销组、举办商品陈列所等方式，大力展开推销工作。九个月来始终没有完成销售计划的纸张，十月份超额完成了计划。上海市贸易信托公司大批卖不出去的深色粗毛花呢料，经过加工裁制成床毯以后，受到家庭主妇们的喜爱，现在已经销出库存量的百分之九十以上。　（本报上海记者站）
    中国百货公司武汉市公司全体职工在十月份增产节约运动中，继续改善经营管理，改进工作方法，全面地超额完成了国家计划。全公司总计完成销售计划百分之一百零四点六三（占第四季度计划的百分之三十五点九），完成购进计划百分之一百零三点八；利润计划完成率比九月份增加了百分之一点五，费用支出率比九月份减少了百分之零点三七。
    十月份，武汉市百货公司百分之九十以上的职工都订了个人增产节约计划，并认真加以贯彻。各零售单位设法改进了商品管理方法，缩短了结业时间，减少了工作差错，有效地提高了工作效率。
