    The people of Xiamen actively report and assist public security organs in capturing special agents of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique.
    When the Xiamen Public Security Organs recently cracked the case of Wang Qiongyao, Xue Shuzhen, and other special agents of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique's special agent organization "Hong Kong South China Office of the Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Interior" lurking in Xiamen City, they received active assistance from resident Chen Lihua (female). Wang Qiongyao and Xue Shuzhen rented Chen Lihua's house after sneaking into Xiamen. Chen Lihua noticed that they had no occupation, left early and returned late every day, and ate and drank extravagantly, which aroused her vigilance. So she paid attention to Wang Qiongyao's actions and reported all suspicious situations to the public security organs. Once, when Wang Qiongyao was out, the postman came to him with a remittance slip from Hong Kong. Chen Lihua also told the public security organs about this situation. Based on the information reported by Chen Lihua, the Xiamen Public Security Organs, after a long period of investigation, completely grasped the criminal evidence of Wang Qiongyao and Xue Shuzhen. According to the instructions of the Hong Kong special agent organization, Wang and Xue collected our military and political intelligence, developed counter-revolutionary organizations, and conspired to carry out sabotage. The public security organs quickly arrested them.
    The capture of lurking special agent Hong Weichuan was due to the reporting of Chen Tiancong, a resident of Xiamen. Chen Tiancong and Hong Weichuan were originally neighbors. After liberation, Hong Weichuan had repeatedly expressed dissatisfaction with the people's government. He went to Hong Kong once two years ago under the pretext of finding friends. After returning, he suddenly changed his attitude and actively participated in the activities of the Returned Overseas Chinese Federation. Chen Tiancong also noticed that Hong Weichuan's family of seven had a monthly income of only 200,000 yuan, while their expenses were 700,000 to 800,000 yuan. After investigation, it turned out that money was being sent to him from Hong Kong. So Chen Tiancong became vigilant, paid attention to Hong Weichuan's actions, and reported what he knew to the public security organs, often taking the initiative to study the situation with the public security organs without complaint. After careful investigation and research by the public security organs, it was confirmed that Hong Weichuan was indeed a special agent of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. After receiving short-term training in Hong Kong, he sneaked back to Xiamen, specializing in collecting our military, political, and economic intelligence.
    Chiang's special agent Zeng Yimu, who had sneaked into a construction site in Xiamen as a transport worker to carry out sabotage and assassination activities, after his crime of spreading rumors and undermining production was exposed, won over Lin Shuimu, a gangster from Xiamen Wharf, and Wu Zaizhen, a ship worker, in an attempt to escape to Kinmen Island. Chen Ahe, a friend of Wu Zaizhen, learned of this news one hour before their escape and immediately reported it to the public security personnel at the construction site. Although Zeng Yimu and others had already taken a boat to the sea, the public security personnel at the construction site caught up in time and arrested them at sea.

    厦门人民积极协助公安机关捕获蒋贼特务
    厦门市人民积极检举和协助公安机关捕获蒋介石卖国集团的特务。
    厦门市公安机关最近在破获蒋介石卖国集团特务组织“内政部调查局香港华南办事处”潜伏在厦门市的特务王琼瑶、薛淑珍等一案时，曾得到居民陈丽华（女）的积极协助。王琼瑶、薛淑珍潜入厦门后，租住了陈丽华的房子。陈丽华见他们没有职业，天天早出晚归，大吃大喝，引起了警惕，于是她就注意观察王琼瑶等的行动，并把一切可疑的情形报告给公安机关。有一次，王琼瑶外出，邮递员拿着一张香港的汇票来找他。陈丽华也把这一情况告诉了公安机关。厦门市公安机关根据陈丽华报告的情况，经过了长期的侦察，完全掌握了王琼瑶、薛淑珍的犯罪证据。王、薛两犯按照香港特务机关的指示，搜集我军事、政治情报，并发展反革命组织，阴谋进行破坏。公安机关很快便将他们逮捕了。
    潜伏特务洪维传的落网，是厦门市居民陈天从检举的。陈天从和洪维传原是邻居，洪维传在解放后曾多次表现过对人民政府不满，前年曾以找朋友为名到香港去过一次，回来后突然改变了态度，积极参加归国华侨联谊会的活动。陈天从又注意到洪维传一家七口，每月收入只有二十多万元，而开支却要七、八十万元，经过调查原来是香港有钱寄给他。于是陈天从就提高警惕，注意洪维传的行动，并把所了解的情况向公安机关报告，常常不辞劳苦地主动和公安机关研究情况。经公安机关周密的调查研究，证实洪维传确实是蒋介石卖国集团的特务，在香港接受短期训练后潜回厦门，专事搜集我军事、政治、经济情报的。
    混进厦门某建设工地当运输工人、伺机进行破坏暗害活动的蒋贼特务曾依木，因为散布谣言，破坏生产的罪行暴露后，就拉拢厦门市码头流氓林水木和船工吴在镇，企图逃往金门岛。吴在镇的好友陈阿和在他们潜逃前一小时得知这一消息，立即报告了工地公安人员。曾依木等虽已乘船下海，但工地公安人员及时赶上，在海上把他们追捕归案。
