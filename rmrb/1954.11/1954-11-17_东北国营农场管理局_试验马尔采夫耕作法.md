Northeast State Farm Administration
	Experiments with Maltsev's Tillage Method
	The Northeast State Farm Administration has designated specialists to study and experiment with the tillage method of the Soviet agricultural innovator Maltsev.
	The researchers organized by the Northeast State Farm Administration have already selected thirty-five hectares of land at the Hongxing Mechanical Farm in Tongbei County, Heilongjiang Province, to prepare for experiments with Maltsev's tillage method. They have already test-tilled once with a modified five-bottom plow, and the results are very good. In addition, the State-run Baoquanling Mechanical Farm and the Jiusan Mechanical Farm are also preparing to conduct experiments with this new tillage method.
	The content of Maltsev's tillage method is: deep plowing once every four to five years with a plow without a moldboard, instead of plowing every year. Only one harrowing is required after harvest each year, which can allow fertilizer and moisture to accumulate in the soil. Because the time between the harvest of autumn grain crops and the freezing of the land is very short in Heilongjiang Province, the work quality of large-scale autumn plowing in local state-owned farms is often affected. One of the advantages of Maltsev's tillage method is that it can solve this problem. (Xinhua News Agency)

    东北国营农场管理局
    试验马尔采夫耕作法
    东北国营农场管理局指定专人研究和试验苏联农业革新者马尔采夫的耕作法。
    东北国营农场管理局组织的研究人员已经在黑龙江省通北县红星机械农场选出三十五公顷土地，准备试验马尔采夫耕作法。他们已经用改装过的五铧犁试耕了一次，结果很好。此外，国营宝泉岭机械农场和九三机械农场也都准备做这种新耕作法的试验。
    马尔采夫耕作法的内容是：每隔四、五年用不带犁壁的犁深耕一次，而不必每年都翻耕。每年只要收割后进行一次耙地，就可以使肥料和水分积聚在土壤内。由于黑龙江省秋粮作物收割期和土地冰冻期距离很短，当地国营农场大片秋翻地的工作质量常常受到影响。马尔采夫耕作法的优点之一，恰好能解决这个问题。　（新华社）
