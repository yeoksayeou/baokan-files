The Ministry of Fuel Industry instructed its subordinate departments to strive to complete this year's basic construction plan. The directive stated: By the end of the third quarter, the basic construction projects of the Ministry of Fuel Industry had cumulatively completed 63.9 percent of the annual plan. Among them, the coal mine system completed 60.4 percent; the thermal power system completed 60.1 percent; the hydropower system completed 74.1 percent; the petroleum system completed 75.2 percent; and the units directly under the Ministry of Fuel Industry completed 32.8 percent. Looking at it by quarter, although the third quarter completed 25.4 percent of the annual plan, which was better than the second quarter, the quarterly plan was not completed by any system except the hydropower system, which exceeded the quarterly plan. The above situation shows that there is still 36.1 percent of the annual plan to be completed in the fourth quarter, with an average of more than 12 percent to be completed each month, which is a heavier task than any previous month. To this end, leaders at all levels must further grasp the on-site situation in a timely manner and discover and solve problems at any time. The leading cadres of basic construction sites should overcome all difficulties, improve progress, pay attention to quality, reduce waste, ensure safety, and strive to complete this year's basic construction tasks.

    燃料工业部指示所属各部门
    争取完成今年基本建设计划
    中央人民政府燃料工业部指示所属各部门，争取完成今年的基本建设计划。指示中说：截至第三季度末，燃料工业部基本建设工程，累计完成年计划的百分之六十三点九。其中煤矿系统完成百分之六十点四；火电系统完成百分之六十点一；水电系统完成百分之七十四点一；石油系统完成百分之七十五点二；燃料工业部直属单位完成百分之三十二点八。按季度来看，第三季度虽完成年计划的百分之二十五点四，比第二季度完成的较好，但除水电系统超额完成季度计划外，其余都没有完成季度计划。以上情况说明尚有全年计划百分之三十六点一的工作量要在第四季度完成，平均每月要完成百分之十二以上，较过去任何一个月的任务都重。为此，各级领导干部必须进一步及时掌握现场情况，随时发现和解决问题。基本建设工地的领导干部，应克服一切困难，提高进度，注意质量，减少浪费，保证安全，争取完成今年全年基本建设任务。
