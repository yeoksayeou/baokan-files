    The Soviet People Greet the Great October Revolution Day
    Surpassing Production of Metal, Machines, and Coal
    In the labor upsurge to greet the October Revolution Day, workers in metallurgical enterprises and machine manufacturing factories throughout the country have already overproduced a great deal of metal and machinery for the state. The employees of the "Dynamo" factory, one of Moscow's largest industrial enterprises, completed their ten-month production task ahead of schedule in the competition to greet the festival, overproducing electrical equipment worth several million rubles for the state. Workers at the Moscow "Caliber Factory" also completed their ten-month production task ahead of schedule, completing the state's production task more than twice as much as originally planned. In Leningrad, workers at a hardware factory completed the test of a steam turbine with a generating capacity of 100,000 kilowatts ahead of schedule in order to welcome the October Revolution Day. The factory's assembly team fulfilled its pledge to greet the festival by assembling this large machine five days ahead of schedule. Steelworkers in the No. 2 open-hearth furnace workshop of the Kuznetsk Integrated Iron and Steel Works in Siberia overproduced more than 4,000 tons of steel in October.
    In addition, miners in various mining areas of the Soviet Union have also over-fulfilled their plans for mining coal and iron ore in greeting the October Revolution Day. Miners at the Rumyantsev Coal Mine, one of the largest mines in the Donets Coal Region, have exceeded the coal mining level set by the end of 1955 in the competition to welcome the October Revolution Day, over-fulfilling the plan by a total of 220,000 tons of coking coal. All coal mines in the Shakhtyorsk Coal Region of Donbass have completed the annual task of over-fulfilling the plan for coal mining ahead of schedule. The amount of coal they have over-fulfilled is equivalent to the monthly coal output of four large coal mines.
    Realizing Competitive Guarantees Ahead of Schedule
    Moscow enterprises have made preliminary summaries of the competitive guarantees they have put forward on the eve of the October Revolution Day. Industrial enterprises in the city of Moscow and the Moscow region have completed 103 percent of their competitive tasks, with labor productivity increasing by 7.8 percent over last year; the total output has increased by approximately 12 percent compared to the same period last year, with over 4.66 billion rubles of products produced over the plan. The Stalin Automobile Factory originally guaranteed to increase labor productivity by 7 percent over last year, but it has already increased by 6.3 percent in the past nine months. The factory's workers have also overproduced 162.2 million rubles worth of products. The Moscow Municipal Housing Construction Trust has increased labor productivity by 16 percent in the past nine months, and construction costs have been reduced by 3.6 percent compared to last year.
    Industrial enterprises participating in the competition in various parts of the Soviet Union have also achieved similar achievements. In Leningrad, enterprises such as the Stalin Metallurgical Plant, the Electric Power Plant, and the Kirov Crane and Transportation Equipment Factory are successfully completing their competition plans. The Zaporozhye Steel Plant, the Molotov Automobile Factory, the Ural Machinery Factory, the Donbass and Karaganda coal mines, and the Baku oil fields have also increased labor productivity and increased product output.
    Laborers Moving into New Homes
    On the eve of the October Socialist Revolution Day, thousands of laborers in the Soviet Union are moving into new homes. Many new clubs, cultural palaces, and children's welfare agencies have opened in various places, and a large number of new stores have begun operations.
    In Riga, the capital of the Latvian Republic, an apartment building built for workers at the railway car manufacturing plant has been completed on the eve of the festival. Hundreds of families in the city will celebrate the festival in comfortable new homes. Thirty-five large apartment buildings have been built in a scenic area between the Daugavpils River and Lake Ķīšezers, and five more apartment buildings are currently under construction. In Minsk, the capital of the Belarusian Republic, several hundred families have moved into new homes in recent days. Stalingrad will have residential buildings with a construction area of more than 10,000 square meters completed around the October Revolution Day for the laboring people to live in. A new workers' residential area has appeared in the Krasnoarmeysky District of Stalingrad. Several new libraries, kindergartens, department stores, food stores, and other public utilities have also opened in Kiev in recent days.
    This year, with the help of state loans, Soviet workers and staff have built 55,000 private houses with a construction area of more than 2 million square meters. There are currently 100,000 private houses under construction. This year, the state used 1 billion rubles for loans for the construction of private houses, which is 300 million rubles more than in 1953. Many private houses will also be completed and used around the October Revolution Day.
    Large Supply of Festival Foods and Gifts
    On the eve of the October Socialist Revolution Day, Moscow's trading organizations are preparing to supply a large amount of food and gifts to ensure that they fully meet the needs of residents to celebrate the festival. Various canteens and restaurants have added ordering points to accept orders for food and festival banquets. In addition to the 100 new stores selling food and industrial products and more than 50 restaurants, canteens, coffee shops, and kiosks opened since the beginning of this year, more than 5,800 kiosks and retail stalls will be opened on November 7 to serve the masses participating in the festival parade. With the improvement of the living standards of the laboring people, the demand and supply of food during this year's festival will further increase. In October 1953, Moscow's average daily sales of meat reached 451 tons, and the average daily sales in early November were 794 tons. However, in October this year, the average daily sales of meat reached 550 tons, and it is expected to increase to 900 tons in early November. At present, the sales volume of fish, candy, cheese, etc. has increased by 50 percent compared with the same period in 1953. The supply of fruits and vegetables has also increased. Around the festival, Moscow's trading organizations will supply residents with 2,500 tons of apples and pears, 500,000 kilograms of grapes, 3 million lemons, and 500,000 oranges, as well as a large amount of canned food and vegetables.

    苏联人民迎接伟大的十月革命节
    超额生产金属、机器和煤
    在为迎接十月革命节而展开的劳动高潮中，各地冶金企业和机器制造业的工人们，已为国家超额生产了许多金属和机器。莫斯科最大的工业企业之一的“狄纳莫”工厂的职工们，在迎接节日的竞赛中，提前完成了十个月的生产任务，为国家超额生产了价值几百万卢布的电工器材。莫斯科“口径工厂”的工人也提前完成了十个月的生产任务，共超过原订计划一倍完成了国家的生产任务。在列宁格勒，一个五金工厂的工人为迎接十月革命节提前完成了一个十万瓩发电能力的汽轮机的试验。这个工厂的装配工作队完成了他们迎接节日的保证，提前五天装配好了这个大型机器。西伯利亚的库兹涅茨克联合钢铁厂二号平炉车间的炼钢工人，在十月份超额炼出了四千多吨钢。
    此外，苏联各矿区的矿工在迎接十月革命节中也超计划开采了许多煤和铁矿。顿尼兹煤区中的一个最大的矿井鲁米扬泽夫煤矿的矿工，在迎接十月革命节的竞赛中，已超过了一九五五年年底以前规定的采煤水准，共超计划开采了二十二万吨焦煤。顿巴斯沙赫焦尔斯克煤区所有的煤矿都提前完成了超计划采煤的全年任务。他们超计划采煤的数量，等于四个大煤矿一个月的采煤量。
    提前实现竞赛保证
    莫斯科各企业已在十月革命节前夕对自己所提出的竞赛保证作了初步总结。莫斯科市和莫斯科州的工业企业已完成了竞赛任务百分之一百零三，劳动生产率比去年提高了百分之七点八；总产品量比去年同期增加了约百分之十二，超计划生产了四十六亿六千多万卢布的产品。斯大林汽车工厂原来保证把劳动生产率比去年提高百分之七，但过去九个月就提高了百分之六点三。工厂的工人并超额生产了一亿六千二百万卢布的产品。莫斯科城市住宅建筑托辣斯九个月来已提高了劳动生产率百分之十六，建筑成本比去年减低了百分之三点六。
    苏联各地参加竞赛的工业企业也同样获得了成就。在列宁格勒，斯大林冶金工厂、电力工厂、基洛夫起重运输装备工厂等企业正在顺利地完成着竞赛计划。萨坡罗什炼钢厂、莫洛托夫汽车工厂、乌拉尔机器工厂、顿巴斯和卡拉干达煤矿、巴库采油场等也提高了劳动生产率，增加了产品数量。
    劳动者迁入新居
    在十月社会主义革命节前夕，苏联有数以千计的劳动者迁入新居。各地又有许多新的俱乐部、文化宫和儿童福利机关开幕，大批新商店开始营业。
    在拉脱维亚共和国首都里加，一幢为铁路车厢制造厂的工人建造的公寓房屋已在节日前夕落成了。全市将有成百的家庭在舒适的新居中欢度节日。在陶格夫匹尔斯河和基什湖之间的一个风景优美的地区，已经建成了三十五幢大型的公寓房屋，目前正在兴建的还有五幢公寓房屋。在白俄罗斯共和国首都明斯克，这几天来已有几百个家庭迁入新居。斯大林格勒将有建筑面积为一万平方公尺以上的住宅在十月革命节前后落成，供劳动人民居住。斯大林格勒市的红军区已出现了一个新的工人住宅区。基辅市最近几天也有几个新的图书馆、幼儿园、百货公司、食品商店和其他公用事业机关开幕了。
    今年苏联工人和职员在国家的贷款帮助下，已建造了建筑面积为二百多万平方公尺的五万五千座私人住宅。目前还有十万座私人住宅正在建筑中。今年国家用于建筑私人住宅的贷款为十亿卢布，这数字比一九五三年多三亿卢布。许多私人住宅也将在十月革命节前后落成使用。
    大量供应节日食品和礼物
    在十月社会主义革命节前夕，莫斯科各贸易机构正在准备供应大量的食品和礼物，以保证充分满足居民欢度节日的需要。各食堂、餐厅都增设了订货处，接受订购食品和节日宴席。除了今年年初以来新开设的一百个出售食品和工业品的商店，五十多个餐厅、食堂、咖啡店和小卖处之外，在十一月七日那一天还将开设五千八百多个小卖处和零售摊，以便为节日游行的群众服务。随着劳动人民生活水平的提高，今年节日期间的食品需要量和供应量将进一步增加。在一九五三年十月，莫斯科平均每天销售的肉类达四百五十一吨，十一月上旬平均每天是七百九十四吨。但在今年十月，肉类销售量平均每天达五百五十吨，预计在十一月上旬将增至九百吨。目前鱼类、糖果、干酪等的销售量都比一九五三年同期增加百分之五十。水果和蔬菜的供应也增加了。在节日前后，莫斯科的贸易机构将供应居民二千五百吨苹果和梨、五十万公斤葡萄、三百万只柠檬和五十万只橘子以及大量的罐头和蔬菜。  （据新华社讯）
