Xinhua News Agency, December 12th: According to TASS, Soviet machine factories and scientific research institutions have recently designed and manufactured many new machines that further mechanize and automate coal mining operations. The Moscow mining area and the Donbas mining area are currently testing the "K-14," "K-26," and "K-32" retreat mining combines designed by the Moscow National Coal Mining Machine Design and Experimental Institute. These new types of coal mining combines can continuously mine, excavate, and retreat. They can cut large pieces of coal from the coal seam, thus reducing power consumption by one-half to one-third and improving the quality of coal mining. Due to the installation of special control mechanisms, the new coal mining combines can also select coal in coal seams of any thickness. The workers of the machine manufacturing plant in Gorlovka, who first produced the Soviet coal mining combines, have also recently manufactured a new type of "Donbas-2" coal mining combine. It is most suitable for mining medium-thickness coal seams. This coal mining combine is equipped with an automatic mechanism that makes the machine move to the working face much faster than existing coal mining machines. The Yasinovataya Mining Equipment Manufacturing Plant in Gorlovka is now starting to produce new 25-ton winches for coal mining enterprises. This winch is controlled by buttons and is suitable for use when excavating mine shafts 800 meters deep. The Leningrad "Gas Dynamics" factory recently produced the first batch of new "спр-11" mining pneumatic drills. This pneumatic drill is three kilograms lighter than the previously manufactured pneumatic drills, is easier to use, and can increase labor productivity by 30 to 40 percent.

On the basis of mechanization, the Soviet coal mining industry is moving further towards automation. The Soviet Union has converted approximately 10,000 coal mining machines to automated remote control. In the various mines of the Stalino and Voroshilovgrad regions alone, approximately 3,000 coal mining combines, coal excavators, winches, and conveyors have been equipped with remote control equipment. More than 250 automatic control pumping stations have been installed in Ukrainian mines. In many mines, unloading coal, weighing coal, and loading coal have been automated.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow dispatch from TASS: The Voroshilovgrad locomotive factory recently designed and trial-produced a freight locomotive with a 1-5-1 wheel arrangement. Trial runs have proven that the new locomotive can haul 600 tons more cargo than a ФД locomotive.

Each coupling axle of this new locomotive can carry a load of 21 tons. The locomotive is also equipped with special devices to increase traction. The new locomotive has a heater that can preheat the water supplied to the boiler to 90 degrees Celsius. The working pressure of the steam in the boiler is 16 atmospheres. The new locomotive has an automatic coal feeder, and the cleaning of the furnace is completely mechanized. The rocking bar of the furnace is driven by compressed air. The driver of the new locomotive has good working conditions. The driver's cab is well-lit and has heating equipment. The signaling equipment and automatic blocking devices on the train can ensure safe driving even when the driver's visibility is poor.

Xinhua News Agency, December 12th: According to TASS, a machine manufacturing plant in New Kramatorsk recently manufactured a giant steel pipe rolling mill. This machine can continuously roll large-diameter steel pipes for the petroleum and gas industries. It is equipped with a special electric welding machine that can immediately weld the joints of the steel pipes during rolling. It would take hundreds of flatbed cars to transport this giant machine to a metallurgical factory in the Urals by train.

This machine manufacturing plant in New Kramatorsk, which is famous in the Soviet Union, is now manufacturing a giant combined machine for rolling channel steel, rails, and steel beams with even greater power for the metallurgical industry. The total weight of this combined machine exceeds 9,700 tons and is composed of 55 kinds of machinery and parts. A total of 900 electric motors are installed on the combined machine, with a total working capacity of 61,000 horsepower. When the new combined machine is operating, it almost completely eliminates the need for manual labor. The entire process of rolling metal, from loading the steel ingot onto the heating furnace to sending out the finished product, is continuous.

    苏联设计和制造出许多新的采煤机器
    并试制出新的曳引力强大的机车和巨型钢管轧制机
    【新华社十二日讯】据塔斯社消息：苏联机器工厂和科学研究机关，最近又设计和制造出许多使采煤工作进一步机械化和自动化的新机器。莫斯科矿区和顿巴斯矿区现在正在试用莫斯科国家采煤机器设计和实验所设计的“K—一四”式、“K—二六”式和“K—三二”式回采联合机。这些新型的采煤联合机可以连续不断地采煤、掘进和回采。它们能够从煤层上大块地截煤，因而使电力消耗减少了二分之一到三分之一，并改善了采煤的质量。由于装置有特殊的操纵机件，新的采煤联合机还可以在任何厚度的煤层中选煤。曾经首次生产苏联采煤联合机的高尔罗夫卡城的机器制造工人们，最近也制造了一种新式的“顿巴斯—二”式采煤联合机。它最适宜于开采中等厚度的煤层。这种采煤联合机装有一种自动机械，使机器调动到工作面的速度比现有的采煤机快得多。高尔罗夫卡城的雅西诺瓦塔雅采矿设备制造厂现在开始为煤矿企业生产二十五吨重的新式绞车。这种绞车由电钮操纵，适宜于开掘八百公尺深的矿井时使用。列宁格勒“气体力学”工厂最近生产了第一批“спр—十一”式新的采矿气钻。这种气钻比以前制造的气钻轻三公斤，使用起来也较方便，并可提高劳动生产率百分之三十到四十。
    苏联煤矿工业在机械化的基础上正在更进一步向自动化前进。苏联已约有一万架采煤机器改为自动化远距离操纵。仅在斯大林诺和伏罗希洛夫格勒州的各个矿场上，就约有三千多台采煤联合机、掘煤机、绞车、运输机等装上了远距离操纵设备。在乌克兰各矿场上，已装置了二百五十多座自动操纵水泵站。在许多矿场上，卸煤、称煤和装煤等工作都已自动化了。
    【新华社讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：伏罗希洛夫格勒的机车工厂最近设计并试制出一辆装有一—五—一车轮的货车机车。试车结果证明，新机车可比一辆ФД机车多曳引六百吨货物。
    这种新机车的每一个联结器轴可以载重二十一吨。机车并设有特殊的装置来提高曳引力。新机车有一个加热器，可以预先把供给锅炉的用水加热到摄氏九十度。锅炉中蒸气的工作压力是十六个大气压。新机车有自动加煤机，炉子的清除工作是完全机械化的。炉子的摇杆用压缩空气来推动。新机车的司机有很好的工作条件。司机室中光线很充足并有暖气设备。车上的信号设备和自动闭塞装置，可以使司机在视线模糊时仍可安全行车。
    【新华社十二日讯】据塔斯社消息：新克拉马托尔斯克一个机器制造厂最近制造出了一台巨型的钢管轧制机。这台机器可以连续轧制大口径的石油工业和煤气工业用的钢管。它装置有专门的电焊机，在轧制时可以立即把钢管的接合处焊上。如用火车把这台巨型机器运到乌拉尔一个冶金工厂，要用几百节平板车。
    驰名苏联的新克拉马托尔斯克的这一个机器制造厂，现在又为冶金工业制造一台效力更强大的轧制槽钢、钢轨和钢梁用的巨型联动机。这台联动机全部重量超过九千七百吨，由五十五种机械和部件组成。在联动机上共装有九百个电动机，总工作能力为六万一千匹马力。新的联动机操作时，几乎可以完全不需要手工劳动，整个的轧制金属的过程，从把钢锭装上加热炉到送出成品为止，都是连续进行的。
