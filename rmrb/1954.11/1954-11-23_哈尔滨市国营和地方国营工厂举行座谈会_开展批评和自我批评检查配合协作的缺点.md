    Harbin State-Owned and Local State-Owned Factories Hold a Forum
    Conduct Criticism and Self-Criticism to Examine Shortcomings in Coordination and Cooperation
    The Heilongjiang Provincial People's Government Planning Commission convened a forum of state-owned and local state-owned industrial enterprises in Harbin on November 5th. At the meeting, in the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, the shortcomings and problems existing in past coordination and cooperation were examined, and information was exchanged with each other.

    The main problems reflected at the forum regarding coordination and cooperation between state-owned and local state-owned industries were: local state-owned industries did not cooperate and coordinate well with state-owned industries. For example, some local state-owned factories pursued products with large output value and high profits, disliked the variety, small quantity, and strict requirements of products processed by state-owned factories, and were unwilling to process for state-owned industries. At the same time, some local state-owned factories, due to low technical levels and poor management, constantly experienced phenomena such as low product quality, high costs, or failure to guarantee on-time delivery. On the other hand, some state-owned factories did not pay attention to utilizing and supporting local state-owned industries, simply complained about local state-owned industries, and did not provide much technical guidance and assistance. Some were unwilling to process parts locally or were unwilling to use locally produced products with similar specifications and quality, preferring to use imported goods or process them elsewhere. For example, Songjiang Chemical Plant can produce ammonium chloride, but the battery factory went to Hankou and Guangzhou to purchase it. Some, even when placing orders for local processing, rarely submitted plans in a timely manner; generally, they processed only when needed, making it difficult for local industries to arrange production, and even had to work overtime to complete tasks on time, which affected product quality.

    At the forum, both sides exchanged information and gained a better understanding. For example, the boiler factory introduced that the factory needed more than 270 items to be processed locally next year, and some state-owned factories introduced many products that needed to be processed locally for a long time, which pointed out the specific direction of efforts for local industries. At the same time, the meeting also reflected that the technical level of local state-owned industries has gradually improved in recent years, and many products that could not be made in the past can now be made, and the quality is very good. For example, the measuring tool and cutting tool factory needed "copper busbar boxes" and had gone to major cities across the country to process them, but no solution was found. Finally, Harbin organized the processing and completed it very well. This proves that as long as state-owned industries and local industries cooperate closely, they can better play the role of assistants to local industries.

    The meeting unanimously agreed that it is necessary to explain the significance of cooperation between state-owned and local state-owned factories to all staff, and to take the initiative to contact each other and strengthen the planning of processing orders; leaders at all levels must also pay attention to the organization and inspection work in this regard, and solve problems in a timely manner to prevent phenomena such as mutual misunderstanding, mutual concealment, and mutual lack of coordination in the work.

    哈尔滨市国营和地方国营工厂举行座谈会
    开展批评和自我批评检查配合协作的缺点
    黑龙江省人民政府计划委员会在十一月五日召开了哈尔滨市国营和地方国营工业企业座谈会。会上以批评和自我批评的精神，检查了过去在配合协作上存在的缺点和问题，并互相交换了情况。
    座谈会上反映出国营和地方国营工业在配合协作上存在的主要问题是：地方国营工业没有很好地同国营工业配合协作。如有些地方国营工厂追逐产值大、利润多的产品，嫌国营工厂加工的产品品种多、数量少、要求严，不愿为国营工业加工。同时有的地方国营工厂由于技术水平不高，经营管理不善，致使某些产品质量低、成本高或不能保证按时交货等现象不断发生。另一方面，部分国营工厂不注意利用和扶植地方国营工业，对地方国营工业单纯瞒怨，在技术上指导和帮助不多。有的不愿在本地加工配件，或不愿用本地出产的规格和质量相近的产品，而喜欢用进口货或到外地加工。如松江化学厂可以生产氯化铵，而电池厂却到汉口、广州去采购。有的虽在地方加工订货，事前也很少及时提出计划；一般的是现用现加工，使得地方工业在生产上很难安排，甚致为了按时完成任务，不得不加班赶制，以致影响产品质量。
    座谈会上双方面交流了情况，有了进一步的了解。如锅炉厂介绍了该厂来年需要地方加工的产品就有二百七十多项，有的国营工厂介绍了许多需要长期在地方加工的产品，这就给地方工业指出了具体努力方向。同时会上也反映出地方国营工业的技术水平几年来已逐步提高，许多过去不能做的产品现在能做了，而且质量很好。如量具刃具厂需要“铜母线盒”曾到全国各大城市去加工，没有得到解决，最后由哈尔滨市组织加工，却很好地完成了。这就证明了只要国营工业和地方工业紧密地配合协作，就能更好地发挥地方工业的助手作用。
    会上一致认为：必须对全体工作人员说明国营和地方国营工厂配合协作的意义，并且主动联系，加强加工订货的计划性；各级领导部门也必须注意这方面的组织和检查工作，发现问题及时解决，以防止在工作中互不了解、互相瞒怨和互不协调等现象发生。（安民　励新）
