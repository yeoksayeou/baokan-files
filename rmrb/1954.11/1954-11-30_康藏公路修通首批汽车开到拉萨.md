Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, November 29th: The East and West sections of the Kangzang Highway construction forces officially met on the 27th. The Ba River Bridge, at the juncture of the two sections, was completed on the afternoon of the 26th. Thus, the construction of the Kangzang Highway, stretching 2,255 kilometers from Ya'an to Lhasa, is now basically complete.

	On the morning of the 27th, when the sun shone from the eastern snow-capped mountains onto the wide Nyang River and Ba River, the valley was filled with joy. Construction soldiers, workers, and Tibetan laborers, dressed in neat clothes, waved colorful flags, and held placards with slogans such as "Build the Border, Consolidate National Defense" and "Bring Happiness to the Tibetan People," cheering as they poured from all directions toward the riverbank and the Ba River Bridgehead, shaking hands and embracing tightly on the bridge. How many difficulties they had overcome on the plateau in the past four years! Today, they have achieved a victorious meeting. Unable to contain their inner excitement, everyone lifted up the construction models and heroes, and shouts and cheers rang out. At this moment, construction models and meritorious soldiers and workers among the Tibetan laborers pinned red flowers on each other. The construction leaders of the East and West sections shook hands with victorious smiles and exchanged words of hardship. People continuously cheered "Long Live Chairman Mao!"

	Several days before, when the two construction teams were working on opposite sides of the river, they sent each other慰问 groups to express their regards and encourage each other to complete the final phase of the project ahead of schedule. In the entire construction project of the Kangzang Highway, the East section construction personnel, from 1950 to the present, built 1,927 kilometers of the highway from east to west; the construction soldiers and workers of the West section, after a march of more than 3,000 li, together with more than 20,000 Tibetan laborers, built 328 kilometers of the highway from Lhasa to the east starting in the summer of 1953.

Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, November 29th: On the afternoon of the 27th, construction soldiers, employees, and Tibetan laborers from the East and West sections of the Kangzang Highway held a celebration meeting on the river beach west of the Ba River Bridge. Chen Mingyi, commander of the Kangzang Highway Construction Command, and Rang Mingde, political commissar, spoke at the meeting. They said: The great construction project of the Kangzang Highway, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and with the active support and assistance of the people of the whole country and the Tibetan people, and through the arduous struggle of all the construction personnel, has completed the 1954 construction task one month ahead of schedule, and the entire project is about to be completed victoriously. They repeatedly encouraged all construction personnel to guard against arrogance and rashness, maintain their honor, and continue to work hard to help the Tibetan people and build and develop the border areas of the motherland. Tengba Kanqiong, the representative of the Tibetan local government and deputy commander of the West section project command of the Kangzang Highway, extended sincere greetings to all the construction personnel on behalf of the Tibetan local government. He said: "Tens of thousands of residents in Lhasa are preparing to welcome the arrival of the happy motorcade."

	The meeting finally passed a congratulatory telegram from all the construction personnel to Chairman Mao. All the construction soldiers, employees, and Tibetan laborers unanimously expressed to Chairman Mao that they would work together with one heart and one mind, make persistent efforts, and build a prosperous and happy new Tibet.

Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, November 29th: The first batch of automobiles on the Kangzang Highway has arrived at the foot of Lhasa City. On the evening of the 27th, a car carrying bridge-building materials smoothly drove from the Ba River Bridge, the meeting point of the East and West sections, to the south bank of the Lhasa River on the outskirts of Lhasa. Now, waiting only for the Lhasa River Bridge to be built, the entire 2,255-kilometer-long Kangzang Highway will be fully opened to traffic.

	When the first batch of automobiles passed through the new route, groups of Tibetans from various villages, towns, and pastures stood by the roadside and on the roofs, waving and cheering at the automobiles. Every time the car stopped, people gathered around. Elderly Tibetans shed tears of excitement, saying: The car sent by Chairman Mao has really arrived at our doorstep. Some children climbed into the driver's seat, some touched the car lights, and cheered around the car.

	In recent days, the Lhasa River ferry has been busy, and the sailors who operate the yak-hide boats have started ferrying people who want to see the cars from dawn every day.

    康藏公路修通首批汽车开到拉萨
    【新华社拉萨二十九日电】康藏公路东西两段筑路大军已经在二十七日正式会合了。两段衔接点的巴河桥在二十六日下午建成。至此，从雅安到拉萨全长二千二百五十五公里的康藏公路修筑工程已基本完工。
    二十七日清晨，当太阳从东面雪山上照到宽阔的尼洋河和巴河上的时候，河谷里就欢乐起来了。河两岸飘扬着彩旗，换上了整洁服装的筑路战士、工人和藏族民工们，举着工具和“建设边疆，巩固国防”，“把幸福带给藏族人民”等标语牌，欢呼着从四面八方拥向河滩和巴河桥头，在桥上紧紧地握手、拥抱。四年来他们在高原上战胜了多少困难呵！今天胜利的会合了。人们禁不住内心的兴奋，大家把筑路模范和功臣们抬起，口号声、欢呼声响成一片。这时，藏族民工中的筑路模范和立功的战士、工人相互佩带上了红花。东西两段工程的施工领导人员，含着胜利的微笑握手并互道辛苦，人们连续地欢呼“毛主席万岁！”
    在十几天以前，两段筑路队伍隔河施工的时候，他们就互相派出慰问组进行慰问，互相鼓励提前完成了最后一期工程。在康藏公路全部修筑工程中，东段筑路人员从一九五零年起到现在，把公路从东向西修了一千九百二十七公里；西段的筑路战士和工人，经过三千多里的徒步行军后，在一九五三年夏天起和两万多藏族民工一道，把公路从拉萨向东修了三百二十八公里。
    【新华社拉萨二十九日电】二十七日下午，康藏公路东西两段筑路战士、职工和藏族民工在巴河桥西面河滩上，举行了庆祝会师典礼大会。康藏公路修建司令部司令员陈明义，政治委员穰明德在会上讲话，他们说：康藏公路的伟大建筑工程，在中国共产党、毛主席的正确领导下，在全国人民及西藏人民的积极支援帮助下，在全体筑路人员的艰苦奋斗下，已提前一个月完成了一九五四年的修筑任务，全部工程即将胜利完工了。他们再三勉励全体筑路人员戒骄戒躁，保持荣誉，为帮助藏族人民，建设和开发祖国边疆继续努力。西藏地方政府代表、康藏公路西段工程指挥部副指挥长藤巴堪穷，代表西藏地方政府向全体筑路人员致衷心的慰问。他说：“拉萨的数万居民正在准备迎接幸福车队的到来”。
    大会最后通过了全体筑路人员给毛主席的致敬电。全体筑路战士、职工和藏族民工一致向毛主席表示，要同心协力，再接再厉，建设繁荣幸福的新西藏。
    【新华社拉萨二十九日电】康藏公路上的第一批汽车已经开到拉萨城下。二十七日晚，载着架桥用料的汽车，从东西两段会合点巴河桥顺利地开到了拉萨市郊的拉萨河南岸。现在只等拉萨河大桥架好，全长二千二百五十五公里的康藏公路就全线通车了。
    当第一批汽车从新路线上通过时，沿线各村镇、牧场成群的藏民站在路边、房顶上向汽车招手欢呼。车子每一停下，人们就围拢来。藏族老人兴奋得流下了眼泪，他们说：毛主席派来的汽车真的开到了家门口。孩子们有的爬上驾驶室，有的摸着车灯，绕着车子欢呼。
    连日来，拉萨河渡口忙碌着，每天驾驶牛皮船的水手从清晨就开始摆渡去看汽车的人们。
