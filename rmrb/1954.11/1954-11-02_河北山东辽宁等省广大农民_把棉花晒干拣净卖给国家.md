Vast Numbers of Farmers in Hebei, Shandong, Liaoning and Other Provinces
　　Dry, Clean, and Sell Cotton to the State

[Report from this newspaper] The vast numbers of farmers in Hebei, Shandong, Liaoning and other provinces are drying and cleaning cotton in a timely manner and enthusiastically selling it to the state.

Farmers in various parts of Hebei Province are actively drawing up plans to sell cotton. Recently, farmers throughout the province have been selling 8.3 million jin of cotton per day. According to statistics up to mid-October, farmers throughout the province had sold more than 186.6 million jin of seed cotton and more than 270,000 jin of ginned cotton to the state. The Wuyi Agricultural Production Cooperative in Nanzhuang Township, Wu'an County, guarantees that all cotton except for the necessary amount retained for personal use will be sold to the state; before the end of November, 23,000 jin of cotton will be sold in four batches. Farmers in Dezhou Prefecture, Shandong Province, sold more than 20 million jin of seed cotton in the first and middle ten days of October. Recently, cooperatives in counties such as Xiajin and Shanghe have been purchasing more than 260,000 jin of seed cotton every day. The Shengli and Xingsheng Agricultural Production Cooperatives in Xingsheng Village, Beizhen County, Liaoning Province, sold a total of more than 12,000 jin of cotton to the state on October 18 alone.

In order to enable textile factories to produce more and better cloth for the people of the whole country, farmers in various places generally carefully dry and pick the cotton before selling it, and try to sell the best quality cotton to the state. Lu Guanxin, a farmer in Shangcun, Wuqiao County, Hebei Province, sold 250 jin of cotton he had picked after repeatedly picking and drying it to the supply and marketing cooperative. The advanced Agricultural Production Cooperative of Sigua Zhang Village in the county sold more than 1,100 jin of new cotton to the supply and marketing cooperative on October 19, which was both dry and clean. The Xinsheng and Qianjin Agricultural Production Cooperatives in Songguantun Village, De County, Shandong Province, educated women on the need to ensure that the cotton picked was ripe and clean, and added large mats to dry and clean the white cotton picked up. In order to sell good cotton to the state, the Dengta Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wangmatai Village, Yingkou County, Liaoning Province, has more than a dozen people specially selecting cotton every day. In the first ten days of October, more than 86,900 kilograms of ginned cotton purchased in Liaoning Province were mostly good cotton with long fibers and white color.

At present, farmers in Hebei Province are busy with autumn cultivation. In order to further facilitate farmers' cotton sales, supply and marketing cooperatives in various places have not only strengthened the cotton collection work at collection points and stations, but also adopted methods such as "taking turns going to the countryside on a regular basis" to carry out large-scale purchases. Quzhou, Yongnian and other counties have newly organized 44 mobile teams to go to the countryside to collect cotton. The Dongzhuosu Cotton Collection Station in Jin County sent people to Nanbaitan on October 13 to collect cotton for one day, and farmers sold more than 40,000 jin of cotton, more than three times the daily purchase volume of the cotton collection station. Farmers have expressed their welcome to this method.

    河北山东辽宁等省广大农民
    把棉花晒干拣净卖给国家
    【本报讯】河北、山东、辽宁等省广大农民及时把棉花晒干拣净，踊跃卖给国家。
    河北省各地农民积极订出计划，出售棉花。最近全省农民每天出售棉花八百三十万斤。到十月中旬统计，全省农民卖给国家的籽棉已有一亿八千六百多万斤，皮棉二十七万多斤。武安县南庄乡五一农业生产合作社保证除留下必要的自用棉外，其余全部卖给国家；在十一月底以前，分四期售棉二万三千斤。山东省德州专区农民，在十月上中旬已出售籽棉两千多万斤。最近夏津、商河等县合作社每日购进的籽棉都在二十六万斤以上。辽宁省北镇县兴胜村胜利、兴胜两个农业生产合作社，在十月十八日一天卖给国家的棉花共有一万二千多斤。
    各地农民为了使纺织工厂能给全国人民生产出更多好布，在出售棉花以前，一般都仔细晒拣，尽量把品质优良的棉花卖给国家。河北省吴桥县上村农民卢关信把摘下来的二百五十斤棉花，经过多次拣晒才卖给供销合作社。该县丝瓜张村先进农业生产合作社在十月十九日卖给供销合作社的一千一百多斤新棉，又干又净。山东省德县宋官屯村新生、前进两个农业生产合作社向妇女进行了摘棉要保证熟、净的教育，并添置大席，将拾来的白花晒干拣净。辽宁省营口县望马台村灯塔农业生产合作社为了把好棉卖给国家，每天都有十多个人专门挑选棉花。十月上旬，辽宁全省收购的八万六千九百多公斤皮棉，大都是绒长、色白的好棉花。
    目前，河北省农民正忙于秋耕，为了进一步便利农民售棉，各地供销合作社除加强点、站的收棉工作外，还采取了“轮村定期下乡”等方法大量进行收购。曲周、永年等县，新组织了四十四个流动组下乡收棉。晋县东卓宿收棉站派人在十月十三日到南白滩收棉一天，农民卖出棉花四万多斤，超过该收棉站当日收购量的三倍。农民对这种办法都表示欢迎。
