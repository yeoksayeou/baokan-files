    Anshan's New Marshalling Yard

   [This dispatch from Anshan on the 26th] A marshalling yard dedicated to railway transportation for the Anshan Iron and Steel Company, the newly built Lingshan Station marshalling yard, has been basically completed and a traffic opening ceremony was held on the 21st. This marshalling yard was designed by the Soviet Design Institute. The marshalling yard is divided into two parts: one is the marshalling yard of the Shenyang Branch of the Harbin Railway Administration; the other is the internal marshalling yard of Anshan Iron and Steel Enterprise. The middle line of the entire marshalling yard is higher, and the lines on both sides are lower, which makes it difficult to store water during the rainy season and can increase the service life. The entire marshalling yard has a total of thirty-seven lines, which can accommodate nearly two thousand wagons, more than twice the size of the original Lishan marshalling yard. This overcomes the past frequent congestion where loaded cars could not enter and empty cars could not exit, accelerating vehicle turnover. The equipment of the entire marshalling yard is modern, and electrical operation is used in many places. Automatic block signals are installed between yards, and trains from other places can directly reach the marshalling yard of Anshan Iron and Steel, and trains assembled and dispatched from Anshan Iron and Steel can also pass through the marshalling yard of the Shenyang Branch of the Harbin Railway Administration and go directly to various places. This improves transportation efficiency and strengthens safe operation. The marshalling yard is also equipped with mechanized automatic coal loaders, water supply stations, and ash removal machines, which can accelerate the efficiency of locomotive use. In addition, there are welfare facilities such as a sewage chlorination station to prevent the spread of germs. The marshalling yard is currently continuing to build mechanized vehicle repair shops and automatic equipment such as locomotive turntables.

    鞍山新建调车场
   【本报鞍山二十六日电】专供鞍山钢铁公司铁路运输使用的调车场——新建的灵山车站调车场已基本完工，并在二十一日举行了通车典礼。这个调车场是由苏联设计学院设计的。调车场分两部分：一是哈尔滨铁路管理局沈阳分局调车场；一是鞍钢企业内部调车场。整个调车场中间线路较高，两侧线路较低，在雨季不易存水，可以增加使用年限。整个调车场共有三十七条线路，能容纳近两千辆车皮，比原来立山调车场大一倍以上。这就克服了过去经常发生的重车开不进、轻车开不出的堵塞现象，加速了车辆周转。整个调车场的设备都是现代化的，许多地方都用电气操作，场和场之间设有自动闭塞信号，从外地来的列车能够直达鞍钢的调车场，从鞍钢编组发出的列车也可以经过哈尔滨铁路管理局沈阳分局调车场直接开往各地。这就提高了运输效能，加强了安全运转。调车场并设有机械化的自动装煤机、给水所和除灰机，可加速机车运用效率。此外还设有防止病菌传播的污水氯化站等福利设施。现在这个调车场正在继续修建车辆机械化检修所，并修建机车方向转换盘等自动设备。
