Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 22nd: Shanghai's industrial sectors still possess considerable potential in conserving raw materials, with the possibility of producing more industrial goods from the same amount of materials. This has been substantiated by compelling data collected by the Shanghai Municipal Leading Organs' Joint Office for Conserving Raw Materials.

Currently, private textile businesses in Shanghai consume approximately 40% of the city's total cotton usage. Compared to state-owned factories, small and medium-sized private factories use four to five more pounds of cotton per yarn bale, with some even using ten to fifteen pounds more. Most large private factories also use two to three pounds more cotton per yarn bale. If the cotton consumption of private cotton mills could be reduced to a level close to that of current state-owned factories, at least 4,700 more yarn bales could be produced annually from the conserved cotton. After weaving these yarns into fabric, it would be enough to provide new clothes for over 1.1 million people.

Although the cotton consumption per yarn bale in Shanghai's nineteen state-owned cotton mills has generally decreased, it is still slightly higher than the target set by the central government for October, exceeding it by 1.44 pounds. When comparing lagging factories with advanced ones, the former uses more than six pounds of cotton per twenty-count yarn bale. The relevant authorities originally planned to save over 150,000 pounds of cotton in the fourth quarter. However, due to the workers' enthusiasm for increasing production and practicing economy, over 70,000 pounds were saved in October alone.

Within various factories, the consumption of electricity, coal, and raw materials for the same products varies considerably. The lowest electricity consumption per ton of copper is 260 kilowatt-hours, while the highest reaches 500 kilowatt-hours. For each ton of electric furnace steel, advanced factories require only 800 kilowatt-hours, while lagging factories need 1,500 kilowatt-hours. In June, the state-owned Shanghai No. 16 Cotton Mill consumed an average of 2.8 kilograms of power coal per bolt of cloth, while the private Hengfeng Yarn Factory used 8 kilograms (recently reduced to approximately 5 kilograms). For the same car tire, the Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory consumes more than 2 kilograms of rubber compared to the Zhengtai Rubber Factory. If the lagging factories in various industries could reach the current level of advanced factories, they could increase production significantly each month.

In the previous period, relevant departments randomly inspected the coal slag from thirty-one factories and discovered that the coal slag from twelve factories still contained more than 20% fixed carbon. In some factories, the carbon content in the cleaned coal slag was as high as 76.42%, exceeding the quality of ordinary Beipiao lump coal.

In gold pen factories, a considerable amount of gold is lost in dust and waste each month. In the first half of this year, an average of only ninety taels of gold out of every hundred taels were made into pen tips, with the remaining ten taels lost during processing. Currently, less than half of the gold can be recovered from the gold-containing ash and waste. If a method could be devised to recover all of it, a large amount of gold could be saved each year.

Out of over one thousand types of products in Shanghai that were originally made of copper, two hundred and twenty-two types have been completely or partially replaced by other raw materials. According to investigations, there are hundreds more that can be made without copper or with less copper. The copper and tin industry is still using copper to manufacture one hundred and one types of products like "longevity character picks," wasting approximately three hundred tons of copper annually. Currently, Shanghai's hardware industry is researching the use of other raw materials to manufacture zippers, shoe eyelets, snap fasteners, and light bulbs. Once successful, this could save another four hundred tons of copper each year.

There are also many things that seem "insignificant" but have a large conservation value. Shirts, raincoats, and underwear all have a small cloth label. The small label in the collar of a shirt alone costs Shanghai 400 million yuan annually, equivalent to the value of 10,000 shirts. Flour sacks used in the flour industry can be used three or four times, but currently, most are not recycled. Based on Shanghai's flour sales volume, over 23,000 bolts of cloth are consumed monthly for flour sacks. If all sacks were recycled and reused once, 138,000 bolts of cloth could be saved annually.

Currently, the Office for Conserving Raw Materials and its fifteen professional groups are still engaged in investigations in various aspects and are studying various reasonable conservation measures.

    上海深入调查原材料节约工作
    发现各工业部门还有很大潜力
    【新华社上海二十二日电】上海市工业部门在节省原材料方面还存在着很大的潜力，用同样数量的原料还可以生产出更多的工业品。这一点已在上海市有关领导机关联合设立的节约原材料办公室所收集的不少富有说服力的资料中得到证明。
    目前上海市私营纺织业所用的棉花占全市总用棉量的百分之四十左右。同国营厂比较，中、小型私营厂每件纱要多用棉花四、五斤，有的甚至多用十斤到十五斤；多数大型私营厂每件纱也多用二、三斤棉花。如果把私营棉纺织厂的用棉量降低到接近于目前国营厂的水平，那末每年至少可以用节约下来的棉花增产四千七百多件纱，把这些纱织成布后，可以供一百一十多万人每人做一套新衣。
    上海十九个国营棉纺织厂每件纱的用棉量虽然已普遍降低，但目前还是比中央提出的从十月份起应达到的指标多耗一点四四斤。其中落后厂和先进厂比较，每件二十支纱要多用六斤多棉花。主管部门原来打算在第四季度内争取节约棉花十五万多斤，由于职工群众发挥了增产节约的积极性，在十月份一个月就节约了七万多斤。
    在各个工厂里，同样的产品，用电、用煤和消耗原材料的情况却很不平衡。每吨铜的耗电量最低是二百六十度，最高的达五百度。每吨电炉钢的耗电量，先进厂只需八百度，落后厂却需要一千五百度。国营上海第十六棉纺织厂六月份平均每匹布所耗用的动力煤是二点八公斤，私营恒丰纱厂却用了八公斤（最近减少到约五公斤）。同样一只汽车外胎，大中华橡胶厂比正泰橡胶厂多耗橡胶二公斤以上。各行业中的落后厂如果都能达到先进厂目前的水平，每月就可以增产很多的产品。
    前一时期有关部门曾经抽查了三十一家工厂的煤渣，发现有十二家的煤渣中还含固定炭百分之二十以上，有的厂清出来的煤渣中，含的炭竟高达百分之七十六点四二，比普通北票统煤的质量还要好。
    在金笔工厂里，每月有不少的黄金消失在灰尘和垃圾中。今年上半年，平均一百两黄金中只有九十两做成笔尖，其余十两在加工过程中损耗了。目前从含有金灰的垃圾中能提炼回来的黄金不到一半，如果能想出办法全部回收，那末每年就可以节约大量的黄金。
    上海市一千多种原先用铜做的产品中，已经有二百二十二种全部或部分改用其他原料。据调查，还有几百种可以不用铜或少用铜。铜锡业还在用铜制造一百零一种“寿字扦”之类的产品，每年约浪费三百多吨铜。目前上海五金工业正在研究用其他原料制造拉链、鞋眼、揿钮、电珠，成功后，每年又可节约四百吨铜。
    还有很多看起来“算不了什么”、可是节约价值很大的东西。衬衫、雨衣、内衣都有一小块布质商标。单单衬衫领子里这块小商标，上海市每年就要耗费四亿元，等于一万件衬衫的价值。面粉工业所用的面粉袋可以用三、四次，但目前大部没有回收。以上海市内的面粉销售量计算，每月面粉袋耗布二万三千多匹，如全部回收并重用一次，一年就能节约十三万八千匹布。
    现在，节约原材料办公室和所属的十五个专业组还在多方面从事调查，并研究各项合理的节约措施。
