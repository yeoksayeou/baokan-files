    How can semi-socialist agricultural producers' cooperatives gradually become socialist?
    Recently, a reader wrote to inquire: The socialist transformation of agriculture uses the method of collectivization, and collectivization must proceed in two steps. How exactly can semi-socialist agricultural producers' cooperatives gradually become socialist? A brief reply is now provided below:
    The main difference between semi-socialist agricultural producers' cooperatives and fully socialist agricultural producers' cooperatives is whether the basic means of production retain their private form or are publicized. A semi-socialist economy is an economy of partial collective ownership by the working masses. This economy partially retains the private form of the means of production and is not a completely socialist economic form. A completely socialist economy is an economy of collective ownership by the working masses. This economy no longer has private ownership.
    The semi-socialist economy of partial collective ownership by the working masses is a transitional form to guide farmers towards collective ownership. Our goal is to eventually transition existing agricultural producers' cooperatives to a completely socialist economy, and this is also the inevitable trend of objective development.
    How can we gradually socialize semi-socialist agricultural producers' cooperatives? How can we transform the partial retention of private ownership of the means of production into public ownership? The most fundamental issue here lies in the development of productive forces and the improvement of the masses' awareness. Under circumstances where the development of productive forces is slow and the political awareness of the members is very low, it is impossible to forcibly transform into a socialist economy. Therefore, gradually increasing public accumulation, raising the level of production, and strengthening political education work, actively preparing conditions economically and politically, is an important prerequisite for the transformation.
    With the gradual development of productive forces and the improvement of the political awareness of the members, the proportion of land remuneration can be gradually reduced and even eventually abolished. After the abolition of land remuneration, the principle of distribution according to labor can be fully implemented. As everyone knows, land is the means of production with the greatest value. Our country's farmers have always had a strong concept of private ownership of land. To solve the public ownership of land, we can only gradually abolish land remuneration and gradually eliminate people's concept of private ownership of land under the conditions of developing production, improving political awareness, and gradually implementing full distribution according to labor. At present, some places adopt the method of purchasing land, so that the funds of public accumulation are used to purchase the land of the members, which cannot be invested in expanding reproduction, which is obviously unfavorable to the development of production.
    Due to the continuous development of productive forces, the labor income obtained by the members according to the principle of remuneration according to labor has greatly increased and has become a reliable source of income. Therefore, the issue of public ownership of draught animals and farm implements can also be gradually resolved. Because production has developed and the income of the members has increased, the majority of farmers are willing to join the cooperative. Moreover, due to the improvement of socialist awareness, the farmers' concept of private ownership of livestock and farm implements will gradually fade. By then, the public ownership of draught animals and farm implements will be easy to handle.
    To gradually transition semi-socialist agricultural producers' cooperatives to a socialist economy, in addition to the gradual public ownership of land, draught animals, and farm implements, public accumulation should also be gradually increased to solve the cooperative's need for production funds. The cooperative's annual working capital, such as investment in seeds, feed, and fertilizers, should be handled by the members paying a certain share fund when joining the cooperative, and by reserving a portion of the public accumulation fund from the total income of the society each year. This is important for developing production, consolidating the cooperative, and preparing conditions for transitioning to socialistization.
    In short, the development from semi-socialist agricultural producers' cooperatives to a completely socialist economy is an inevitable trend of objective development. However, this transformation must proceed under the strong leadership of the Party and according to certain objective laws. In the next few years, in terms of agricultural collectivization, we should first concentrate our efforts on universally developing agricultural producers' cooperatives with partial collective ownership, so as to quickly incorporate the individual economy into the planned track to meet the needs of industrial and agricultural construction. Some agricultural producers' cooperatives that already have the conditions to transform into complete socialistization must be led to complete the transition in a timely manner, and cannot lag behind the masses. As for those who do not have the conditions for transformation, they should actively create conditions, and must never leap over the unfinished form of movement and rush to transform, resulting in losses.

### 半社会主义性质的农业生产合作社怎样逐渐社会主义化

    半社会主义性质的农业生产合作社怎样逐渐社会主义化
    最近读者来信询问：对农业社会主义改造是用合作化的办法，而合作化要分两步走，究竟半社会主义性质的农业生产合作社怎样才能逐渐社会主义化呢？现在简复如下：
    半社会主义性质的农业生产合作社和完全的社会主义性质的农业生产合作社不同的主要标志是基本生产资料保留着私有形态或是公有化。半社会主义性质的经济，是劳动群众部分集体所有制的经济，这种经济部分地保留着生产资料私有形态，还不是完全的社会主义性质的经济形式。完全的社会主义经济是劳动群众集体所有制的经济，这种经济，已经没有私有制的形态存在。
    劳动群众部分集体所有制的半社会主义性质的经济是引导农民走向集体所有制的过渡形式。把现有的农业生产合作社最后过渡到完全的社会主义经济，这是我们的目的，也是客观发展的必然趋势。
    怎样才能把半社会主义性质的农业生产合作社逐渐社会主义化呢？怎样使部分保留生产资料私有形态转变到公有化呢？这里最根本的问题在于生产力的发展和群众觉悟水平的提高。在生产力发展迟缓，社员的政治觉悟水平很低的情况下，无论如何是不能勉强转变到社会主义经济的。因此，逐步增加公共积累，提高生产水平，并加强政治教育工作，积极地从经济上、政治上准备条件，是转变的重要前提。
    随着生产力的逐步发展和社员政治觉悟的提高，土地报酬的比例是可以逐步降低以至最后废除的。在废除了土地报酬以后就可以完全实行按劳分配的原则。大家知道，土地是价格最大的生产资料，我国农民对土地的私有观念一向就很浓厚，我们要解决土地公有化，只有在发展生产、提高政治觉悟，并逐步实行完全的按劳分配的条件下，才能逐步废除土地报酬，逐渐消除人们对土地的私有观念。现在有的地方采用购买土地的办法，使公共积累的资金用到购买社员的土地上，不能投入扩大再生产，对发展生产显然是不利的。
    由于生产力的不断发展，社员们根据按劳取酬原则所得的劳动收入又大大增加，并成为可靠的收入来源，因而耕畜、农具的公有化问题也就可以逐步得到解决。因为生产发展了，社员们的收入增加了，多数农民也就愿意加入合作社了，而且因为社会主义觉悟的提高，农民对于牲畜、农具的私有观念也会逐渐淡漠，到那时，耕畜、农具的公有化也就容易处理了。
    要使半社会主义农业生产合作社逐步过渡到社会主义经济，除了土地、耕畜、农具逐步公有化以外，还应该逐步增加公共积累，以解决合作社生产资金的需要。合作社每年的流动资金，如种籽、饲料和肥料的投资，应该采取社员入社时缴纳一定的股份基金的办法，以及每年由社的总收入中预留一部分公积金的办法，这对于发展生产和巩固合作社并准备条件转变到社会主义化是有着重要作用的。
    总之，由半社会主义性质的农业生产合作社发展到完全的社会主义经济是客观发展的必然趋势。但是这种转变，必须在党的坚强领导下，根据一定的客观法则前进。在今后几年内，在农业合作化方面，应当首先集中力量普遍发展部分集体所有制的农业生产合作社，以便迅速地把个体经济纳入计划轨道配合工农业建设的需要。某些已经具备转变为完全的社会主义化条件的农业生产合作社，必须及时领导完成过渡，不能落在群众的后面。至于不具备转变条件的，则应该积极创造条件，绝不能跳越还没有完结的运动形式，急于转变，而致造成损失。
