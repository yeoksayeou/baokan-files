    Key Construction Underway on Northern Section of Baoji-Chengdu Railway
    Survey Team for Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway Enters Xingxing Gorge
    More than 30,000 construction workers are now concentrated on key construction of the northern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway. Within the 80 kilometers from Baoji southward across the Qinling Mountains, construction workers are excavating and filling earth and stone, laying tracks, chiseling tunnels, and building bridge foundations. Track-laying workers have already laid eight kilometers of tracks, and earth and stone workers are building roadbeds along mountain gullies and cliffs.
    The most intensive construction is currently taking place at the Qinling Grand Tunnel. This tunnel is very long and will pass through the highest peak of the Qinling Mountains. Since construction began on this project in April and May of this year, pilot tunnels have been dug more than 200 meters into both the north and south tunnel entrances.
    Most of the tunnels on the already commenced northern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway are using mechanized construction, which has accelerated the construction progress. On October 20th, tunnel workers set a new record of digging four meters in one day. (Xinhua News Agency)
    Preparatory work for surveying and designing the Lanzhou-Urumqi-Almaty Railway within China, from Yumen to Urumqi, has already begun. Currently, the route selection survey team has entered Xingxing Gorge, at the border of Gansu and Xinjiang, and is advancing towards Hami in Xinjiang. The First Survey and Design Team of the Northwest Design Bureau of the Ministry of Railways is responsible for the surveying and design work for this railway. While actively completing the surveying and design tasks for the entire year, they are also starting the preparatory work for surveying and designing the route from Yumen to Urumqi. On November 12th, the route selection survey team departed from Wuwei to conduct surveys along the Hami route. Indoor design personnel also completed the preliminary route plan from Yumen to Urumqi before November 8th, based on existing data, and are submitting it to higher authorities for approval. The Yumen-Urumqi section is more than 1,100 kilometers long and passes through sparsely populated grassland areas, desert areas, permafrost areas, water-scarce and waterless areas, and high-level seismic zones. Therefore, both work and life are very difficult. The First Survey and Design Team of the Northwest Design Bureau will relocate from Wuwei to Jiuquan in December to better lead this work.

    宝成铁路北段正在进行重点施工
    兰新铁路选线调查组进入猩猩峡
    宝成铁路北段现在集中三万多筑路工人进行重点施工。从宝鸡越秦岭山脉向南的八十公里内，筑路工人们正在挖填土石方、铺轨、凿隧道和筑桥梁基础。铺轨工人已铺好了八公里铁轨，土石方工人正沿着山沟和悬崖建筑路基。
    现在施工最紧张的地方是秦岭大隧道。这个隧道很长，要穿过秦岭最高的山峰。这项工程从今年四、五月间开工到现在，南北两头的隧道口的导洞都已挖进了二百多公尺。
    宝成铁路北段已开工的隧道，大都采用机械化施工，施工进度比较快。十月二十日，隧道工人曾创造了一天挖进四公尺的新纪录。　（新华社）
    兰州—乌鲁木齐—阿拉木图铁路中国境内从玉门到乌鲁木齐的勘测设计准备工作已经开始。目前选线调查组已进入甘肃新疆交界的猩猩峡，向新疆的哈密前进。担负这条路的勘测设计工作的是铁道部西北设计分局第一勘测设计总队。他们在积极完成今年全年勘测设计任务的同时，即着手进行从玉门到乌鲁木齐的勘测设计准备工作。十一月十二日选线调查组已从武威出发，前往哈密沿线进行调查。室内设计人员也在十一月八日以前根据原有资料分别完成了从玉门至乌鲁木齐的初步线路方案，正呈请上级审定。玉门至乌鲁木齐全长一千一百多公里，要经过荒无人烟的草滩地带、沙漠地带、翻浆地带、无水缺水区、高级地震区等。因此工作和生活都很艰苦。西北设计分局第一勘测设计总队将在十二月内由武威搬至酒泉，以便更好地领导这一工作。　（张　果）
