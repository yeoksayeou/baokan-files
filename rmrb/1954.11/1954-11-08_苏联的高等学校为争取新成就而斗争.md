    Soviet Higher Education Institutions Strive for New Achievements
    By V.P. Yelyutin, Minister of Higher Education of the USSR
    Soviet higher education institutions have always occupied one of the most important positions in the national education system. This is natural. Higher education institutions are decisive in cultivating new intellectuals and training new scientific and technical cadres for various sectors of the national economy and culture. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government constantly pay attention to the development of higher education.
    In recent years, higher education institutions have achieved significant results. The number of graduates from higher education institutions has been increasing continuously, and their theoretical level of study has also been improving. The number of students in various agricultural specialties has increased rapidly. The training of specialists in some new technology sectors has been organized. In 1954, the number of students in higher education institutions more than doubled compared to 1940, reaching 1,700,600. In 1954, there were more than 230,000 young specialists graduating from higher education institutions.
    Now, the Soviet people are realizing the grand program of communist construction formulated by the Communist Party and the Soviet government, and are working selflessly to further develop heavy industry, rapidly develop agriculture, and produce daily consumer goods. Therefore, new and important tasks have been put forward to Soviet higher education institutions. The rapid development of the national economy requires more and more highly skilled specialists. The task of Soviet higher education institutions is to improve the training of specialists, so that they can work creatively, independently solve complex technical problems, continuously improve technology, and increase labor productivity.
    The directives of the 19th Congress of the CPSU and the subsequent resolutions of the Party and the government clearly pointed out the road to realize the tasks of the higher education workers.
    Not long ago, the Council of Ministers of the USSR and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union adopted a new resolution: "On improving the training, allocation and utilization of specialists with higher and secondary specialized education." It involves all the most important issues for the further development of higher education in our country. This primarily includes the planning of specialist training, further improvement of the teaching process and political and ideological education in schools, and the correct allocation and utilization of young specialists in various sectors of the national economy and culture.
    The resolution also assigned the responsibility of ensuring the further development of scientific research and pedagogical research in higher education institutions, so that it serves the tasks of improving the scientific level of teachers, cultivating young scientific cadres, compiling textbooks, and improving teaching work. The task of professors and teachers in higher education institutions is to participate more widely in the work of solving the most important scientific problems for industry, agriculture, and transportation, to carry out scientific research according to the plans of various enterprises and ministries, and to summarize advanced experience. Correspondence education and evening education also intend to be greatly developed further.
    The most important problem for Soviet higher education institutions is to fundamentally improve the plans for training specialists. Until now, the urgent needs of some sectors of the national economy for specialists, especially in industrial and civil construction, electrical engineering, agricultural mechanization, and machine manufacturing technology, have not been fully met. However, the training of cadres in some humanities majors has exceeded the needs. Therefore, the national economic plan for 1954 has stipulated certain changes in the enrollment of various majors in higher education institutions. The enrollment of technical higher education institutions accounted for 37.2 percent of the total enrollment, exceeding the 1940 target by 1.6 times. In 1954, various agricultural colleges enrolled 11.7 percent of all new students, more than twice as much as in 1940. In the future, the number of students in these majors will continue to increase, which will ensure that the work of training lacking cadres will be rapidly developed.
    The resolution of the Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the CPSU also assigned the responsibility of stipulating the correct ratio between the training of higher and secondary specialists, so that for every higher specialist trained, at least two to four secondary specialists should be trained (depending on the characteristics of various sectors of the national economy and culture).
    Every period of development of the Soviet national economy, science, technology, and culture puts forward its own new requirements for the specialization of higher education institutions. This point was not always correctly estimated when deciding on specialties and sub-specialties in the recent past. In many cases, specialists with narrow specializations were trained, which did not meet the needs of various sectors of the national economy and culture, and reduced the quality of specialists, making it difficult to use them. Now the number of majors in higher education institutions has been greatly reduced, which can ensure the training of specialists with a wider range of expertise. Higher education institutions should train such specialists with a broad range of expertise, so that they can change their jobs without difficulty when the inevitable reorganization occurs within the national economy in the future. However, secondary technical schools should train cadres with narrower specializations.
    The broad range of training places higher demands on the general scientific culture of specialists. They should not only know the modern scientific concepts in their own major, but also be able to apply them in various different conditions in their work. To cultivate and educate specialists with a broad range of expertise, general scientific education and professional education must be closely integrated with each other.
    Currently, the Ministry of Higher Education is widely recruiting scholars and industrial workers to formulate new teaching plans, which will increase the proportion of general scientific subjects and general professional subjects.
    Adjusting the various specialties and sub-specialties for training specialists in higher education institutions is of great significance for further improving the work of training cadres with higher education levels. It makes it possible to improve the teaching plan by reducing the phenomenon of numerous subjects and changing some subjects from required to elective. The subsequent work of formulating course syllabuses will be able to eliminate duplication in various grades and remove secondary materials that have gradually accumulated but have become superfluous and of little value from the course syllabuses. Finally, it will be particularly important to take into account the latest achievements of science and advanced experience in the course syllabuses. In the field of higher agricultural education, this work is underway. Such revisions to teaching plans and course syllabuses can reduce the number of required class hours to increase the time for students to study independently.
    An important tool for improving the quality of specialist training is good textbooks and study reference books. Well-written and concise textbooks will fundamentally facilitate the training of young specialists and help improve their quality.
    Making textbooks more concise, mainly describing the basic and principled principles of the subject in the textbooks, means at the same time to achieve its stability, which is the quality necessary for a good textbook. Textbooks must explain the achievements of modern science and the advanced practice of socialist construction. Letting students know about these achievements is one of the effective ways to educate them with a creative spirit.
    The work of compiling stable textbooks for all basic subjects in higher education institutions that do not currently exist and fundamentally rewriting existing textbooks should be completed in the next three or four years. In order to compile textbooks and teaching reference books, the best authors are currently being recruited. To encourage this major work, higher education institutions are allowed to include the compilation of textbooks in the teaching research work plan, and the authors are given creative leave when writing.
    In ensuring the due quality of the specialist training work of higher education institutions, the organic combination of theoretical education and practical education in the teaching process plays a huge role. When interning, students should independently take on positions commensurate with their field of study and work independently. Professors, teachers and the most skilled production experts must be more widely recruited to lead internships. Measures are currently being taken to ensure that students can intern in large and advanced enterprises. In such enterprises, future young specialists can familiarize themselves with new technologies and production operation processes.
    The organization of production internships is the personal responsibility of the chief engineer of the factory, the stationmaster of the agricultural machine tractor station, the director of the state farm, and the deputy leaders of the institution and scientific research institute.
    The material and technical guarantee of higher education institutions has great significance in its entire life. The Communist Party and the Soviet government are very concerned about expanding the material and technical foundation of higher education institutions. Huge amounts of funds are allocated every year for new capital construction and to equip higher education institutions with modern instruments and equipment.
    Now a task is put forward: to eliminate the shortcomings in the building of higher education institutions and to equip laboratories and workshops with modern equipment and the latest instruments in the next two years. Higher education institutions are expecting great assistance from various industrial ministries in this matter. Soviet higher correspondence education and evening education, which have been widely developed in recent years, have a promising future. The extremely important significance of correspondence education and evening education lies in the fact that it enables hundreds of thousands of people engaged in production labor in the national economy to systematically study without leaving their place of production. The vast majority of students in correspondence colleges and evening colleges study the same major as their labor profession. In this way, higher correspondence schools and evening schools train highly skilled specialists who can directly lead the work of certain production departments after graduation.
    In recent years, the work of training specialists in higher correspondence schools and evening schools will be further widely developed. The total number of students in the higher and secondary technical correspondence education and evening education system will double in 1960 compared with 1953, of which agricultural and technical majors will increase by at least two times. The network of higher correspondence schools and evening schools will also be greatly expanded, the teaching material foundation will be consolidated, and the conditions for students to study will also be improved.
    The expanded plan for higher education without leaving production is to enable most of the practical workers who hold the positions of engineers and agronomists to participate in learning in the near future.
    Improving the quality of specialist training, correctly allocating and using them in various sectors of the national economy and culture, and the communist education of student youth are the most important national work. The workers of Soviet higher education institutions and secondary technical schools will do their best to successfully complete these tasks.

    苏联的高等学校为争取新成就而斗争
    苏联高等教育部部长  维·彼·叶利乌金
    苏联的高等学校在国民教育系统中一向占据着最重要的位置之一。这是很自然的。高等学校对于培养新知识分子，对于培养派往国民经济和文化各个部门工作的新的科学和技术干部，具有决定意义。苏联共产党和苏联政府经常注意高等学校的发展。
    最近几年中，高等学校获得了重大的成绩。高等学校毕业生不断增加，他们学习的理论水平也不断提高。农业方面各个专业的学生人数有了迅速增加。组织了一些新技术部门的专门人才的培养工作。一九五四年高等学校的学生人数比一九四○年增加了一倍多，达到了一百七十万零六千人。一九五四年，从高等学校毕业的青年专门人才便有二十三万余人。
    现在，苏联人民正实现着共产党和苏联政府制定的宏大的共产主义建设纲领，奋不顾身地为进一步发展重工业、迅速发展农业和日用消费品生产，所以向苏联高等学校提出了新的重大任务。国民经济的迅速发展，要求愈来愈多的高度熟练的专门人才。苏联高等学校的任务是改善专门人才的培养，使他们能够创造性地工作，独立解决复杂的技术问题，不断改善技术，提高劳动生产率。
    苏共十九次代表大会的指示和此后党和政府的决议，清楚地指出了实现高等学校工作者的任务的道路。
    不久前，苏联部长会议和苏联共产党中央委员会通过了一项新的决议：“关于改善具有高等和中等专门教育水平的专门人才的培养、分配和使用情况”。它涉及了我国高等学校进一步发展的所有最重要的问题。这首先便是专门人才培养的计划、进一步改善教学过程和学校中的政治思想教育、正确分配和使用国民经济和文化各部门中青年专门人才等问题。
    决议还责成保证进一步发展高等学校中的科学研究工作和教学法的研究工作，使它服从于提高教员科学水平、培养青年科学干部、编订教科书和改善教学工作的任务。高等学校的教授和教员们的任务，是更广泛地参加为工业、农业、运输业解决最重要的科学问题的工作，按照各个企业、各个部的计划进行科学研究，总结先进经验。函授教育和夜间教育也打算进一步大大地发展。
    苏联高等学校的最重要的问题，便是根本改善专门人才培养的计划。直到现在为止，国民经济某些部门对于专门人才的急迫需求，特别是工业建筑和民用建筑、电力学、农业机械化、机器制造工艺学方面的需求，远没有全部满足。但是某些人文科学专业的干部却又培养得超过了需要。因此，在一九五四年的国民经济计划中，已经规定了对高等学校各专业的招生人数作某些改变。技术性高等学校招生人数占招生总数的百分之三十七点二，超过一九四○年指标一点六倍。一九五四年各农学院招收了全部新生的百分之十一点七，比一九四○年多二倍。今后这些专业的学生人数还要增加，这将保证培养缺乏的干部的工作获得迅速发展。
    部长会议和苏共中央的决议同时还责成规定高等专门人才和中等专门人才培养中的正确比例，要使得每培养一名高等专门人才便至少要培养二至四名中等专门人才（视国民经济和文化各部门的特点而定）。
    苏联国民经济、科学、技术、文化发展的每一个时期，都向高等学校的专业化提出自己新的要求。这点在不久的过去决定专业和小专业时不是经常都被正确地估计到的。在许多场合，培养了方面狭窄的专门人才，这不符合国民经济和文化各部门的需要，并使专门人才的质量降低，使用他们也有了困难。现在高等学校中专业数目大大地减少了，这便可以保证培养方面较广的专门人才。高等学校应该培养这样的方面宽广的专门人才，使他们在国民经济内部将来必不可免地发生改组时，能够毫不困难地改变自己的工作。但是中等技术学校却应该培养较窄专业的干部。
    培养的方面宽广，向专门人才的一般科学文化提出了更高的要求。他不仅应该知道自己专业方面的现代科学观念，而且还应该能在自己工作中的各种不同条件下运用它。培养和教育方面宽广的专门人才，要把一般科学教育和专业教育密切地相互渗透地结合。
    目前高等教育部正在广泛吸收学者和工业工作者，制定新的教学计划，其中要增加一般科学科目和一般专业科目的比重。
    调整高等学校中培养专门人才的各种专业和小专业，对进一步改善培养具有高等教育水平的干部的工作，有重要的意义。它使得可以用减少科目繁多现象，以及把某些科目由必修改为选修的方法来改善教学计划。以后接着进行的制定课程大纲的工作，将可以消除各个年级中的重复现象，把逐渐积累起来、但已成为多余的和很少价值的次要材料从课程大纲中取消。最后，特别重要的，将可以在课程大纲中考虑到科学和先进经验的最新成就。在高等农业教育方面，这项工作正在进行。这样改订教学计划和课程大纲，便可以缩减必修课时数，来增加学生自修的时间。
    提高专门人才培养工作质量的重要工具是良好的教科书和学习参考书。编写得良好的简明的教科书，会根本地便利青年专门人才的培养工作并有助于改善其质量。
    使教科书更加简明，在教科书中主要叙述本科基本的、有原则意义的原理，便是说同时要作到它的稳定性，即为好教科书所必需的质量。教科书必须阐释现代科学和社会主义建设的先进实践的成就。让学生知道这种成就，是用创造精神教育他们的有效方法之一。
    编订高等学校一切基本学科现在没有的稳定教科书和根本改写现有的教科书的工作，应该在最近三、四年中完成。为了编写教科书和教学参考书，目前吸收了最优秀的作者。为鼓励这一重大的工作起见，允许高等学校把编写教科书列入教学研究工作计划，作者写作时并给予创作假期。
    在保证高等学校的专门人才培养工作的应有质量方面起巨大作用的，是在教学过程中把理论教育和实践教育有机地结合起来。实习的学生在生产实习时，应该担负与其学习的方面相当的职务而独立工作。必须更广泛地吸收教授、教员和最熟练的生产专家来领导实习。目前正在采取措施，以保证学生能在大型先进企业中进行实习。在这种企业中，未来的青年专门人才可以熟习新的技术和生产操作过程。
    生产实习的组织，由工厂的总工程师、农业机器拖拉机站的站长、国营农场场长和机关、科学研究所的副领导者个人负责。
    高等学校的物质、技术保证在它全部生活中具有重大意义。共产党和苏联政府对扩大高等学校的物质技术基础十分关心。每年都有巨额拨款用来进行新的基本建设和用现代仪器设备来装备高等学校。
    现在提出了一项任务：消除高等学校校舍建筑中的缺点，并在最近两年中用现代设备和最新的仪器来装备实验室和工场。高等学校在这件事上正期待着各工业部的巨大援助。近年来获得广泛发展的苏联高等函授教育和夜间教育，具有远大的未来。函授教育和夜间教育的极端重要的意义，在于它使得在国民经济中从事生产劳动的几十万人能够不脱离生产地进行有系统的学习。函授学院和夜间学院的绝大多数学生所学都与其劳动专业一致。这样，高等函授学校和夜间学校培养能够在毕业后直接领导一定生产部门工作的高度熟练的专门人才。
    在最近几年中，高等函授学校和夜间学校中的专门人才培养工作将要获得更加广泛的发展。高等和中等技术函授教育和夜间教育系统的学生总数在一九六○年要比一九五三年增加一倍，其中农业专业和技术专业至少要增加两倍。高等函授学校和夜间学校网也将大大扩大，教学物质基础将予巩固，学生学习的条件也将改善。
    不脱离生产的高等教育的扩大计划，是要在最近时期内，使得担任工程师和农艺师职务的实际工作者，大部分都能参加学习。
    提高专门人才培养工作的质量，在国民经济和文化各部门中正确的分配和使用他们，以及对学生青年的共产主义教育，是最重要的国家工作。苏联高等学校和中等技术学校的工作者将竭全力来顺利地完成这些任务。
