    Democratic Women's Federation Chairman Cai Chang Sends a Telegram to the UN General Assembly President
    Requesting the Restoration of the WIDF's Consultative Status with the Economic and Social Council
    中华全国民主妇女联合会 (All-China Democratic Women's Federation) Chairman Cai Chang sent a telegram to the President of the United Nations General Assembly, Dr. Eelco van Kleffens, requesting the immediate restoration of the Women's International Democratic Federation's consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. The telegram stated: We, the women of China, strongly protest the resolution passed by the United Nations Economic and Social Council on April 6, 1954, to revoke the Category B consultative status enjoyed by the Women's International Democratic Federation in the Council. We believe that, in order to uphold the dignity of the United Nations Charter, for the sake of world peace, and for the welfare of women and children, the United Nations General Assembly should cancel this unreasonable resolution and immediately restore the consultative status that the Women's International Democratic Federation should enjoy in the United Nations Economic and Social Council.

    我民主妇联主席蔡畅致电联大主席
    要求恢复国际妇联在经社理事会的咨询地位
    【新华社十日讯】中华全国民主妇女联合会主席蔡畅致电联合国大会主席范克里芬斯博士，要求立即恢复国际民主妇女联合会在联合国经济及社会理事会中的咨询地位。电文说：我们中国妇女严重抗议联合国经济及社会理事会在一九五四年四月六日通过的关于取消国际民主妇女联合会在理事会中所享有的乙级咨询地位的决议。我们认为：为了维护联合国宪章的尊严，为了世界和平的利益和妇女儿童的福利，联合国大会应取消这项不合理的决议并立即恢复国际民主妇女联合会在联合国经济及社会理事会中应享有的咨询地位。
