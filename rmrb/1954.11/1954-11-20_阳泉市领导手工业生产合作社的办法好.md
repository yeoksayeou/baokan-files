The city of Yangquan, Shanxi Province, has already organized ninety-four handicraft production cooperatives and seven production teams in twenty-one different industries such as coal, iron, and sulfur. The Yangquan City Handicraft Production Cooperative United Society, based on the different conditions of each cooperative, classifies, categorizes by industry, and categorizes by cooperative, adopting the method of focusing on key cooperatives to drive general cooperatives, strengthening leadership over each handicraft production cooperative, and has already made considerable achievements.

Each handicraft production cooperative, with key cooperatives as the core, holds a group meeting (joint meeting of several cooperatives) every half month to review the work of the first half of the month, arrange the work for the second half of the month, solve general problems in production, and exchange production experience. If problems with general applicability are discovered in production, they hold industry-wide symposiums, collect everyone's opinions, and study and solve them in a timely manner. Cadres of the Handicraft Production Cooperative United Society are divided into groups and assigned tasks to provide key guidance to them.

Since the implementation of this leadership method, all handicraft production cooperatives in the city, whether old or new, have been continuously consolidated and strengthened. Through this leadership method, problems such as unreasonable labor organization, lax labor discipline in some handicraft production cooperatives, and lack of leadership experience in the newly established cooperative councils have been resolved, and phenomena such as idling and waste have been overcome, as well as the shortcomings of grassroots cooperatives seeking the United Society for everything, resulting in wasted time and affecting production. For example, the Sanducun Iron Production Cooperative once experienced waste of raw materials and an increase in defective products due to poor management, losing more than 23 million yuan in January and February alone. After discussion, the cooperative established a material requisition system, a responsibility system, and a finished product inspection system. From April to June, in addition to making up for the losses in January and February, it also had a surplus of more than 54 million yuan; the defective rate of iron plates also decreased from 15% to 9%.

In addition, the Yangquan City Handicraft Production Cooperative United Society has also focused on training 287 people including directors, deputy directors, accountants, kiln furnace technicians, frame pot technicians, and internal combustion engine workers of handicraft production cooperatives in the past year. This has also played a significant role in consolidating and strengthening handicraft production cooperatives. (Report from Shanxi Reporter Station of this newspaper)

    阳泉市领导手工业生产合作社的办法好
    山西省阳泉市已经在煤、铁、磺等二十一种不同行业中组织了九十四个手工业生产合作社、七个生产小组。阳泉市手工业生产合作社联合社根据各社不同情况，分类、分业、分社，采取以重点社为中心带动一般社的方法，加强对各手工业生产合作社的领导，已经作出不少成绩。
    各手工业生产合作社以重点社为核心，每半月召开一次小组会（几个社的联席会），检查上半月工作，布置下半月工作，解决生产中一般性的问题，互相交流生产经验。发现生产中带有普遍性的问题，便举行同行业座谈会，集中大家的意见，及时研究和解决。手工业生产合作社联合社的干部分片分工，对它们进行重点指导。
    这种领导方法推行以后，全市手工业生产合作社不论老社、新社都不断巩固和壮大。通过这种领导方法，解决了部分手工业生产合作社劳动组织不合理、劳动纪律松弛和新建社理事会缺乏领导经验等问题，克服了窝工、浪费等现象，以及基层社大事小事找联社，以致浪费时间、影响生产的缺点。如三都村铁业生产合作社由于管理不善，曾经发生了原材料浪费，次品增加的现象，仅一、二两月份就赔了二千三百多万元。经过座谈讨论，该社建立了领发材料制度、责任制和成品检验制，从四月到六月，除补起一、二月份的亏欠外，还盈余五千四百多万元；铁板次品也由百分之十五降低到百分之九。
    另外，阳泉市手工业生产合作社联合社一年来还有重点地轮训了手工业生产合作社主任、副主任、会计、闷炉技工、架子锅技工、内燃机工人等二百八十七人。这对巩固和壮大手工业生产合作社也起了不小的作用。（本报山西记者站）
