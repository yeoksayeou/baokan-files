    Eliminate the Reactionary Philosophical Poison of Hu Shi
    ——Also a Critique of Yu Pingbo's Erroneous Views and Methods in Researching *Dream of the Red Chamber*
    Wang Ruoshui

    Why is the criticism of erroneous viewpoints in *Dream of the Red Chamber* research said to be "another serious struggle on the ideological front by the working class against the bourgeoisie"?

    The field of classical literature research has always been one of the weaker links on the cultural front. Since the bourgeoisie seized this position from the feudal class, it has basically been occupied by the Hu Shi faction, the representative of bourgeois idealism, for more than thirty years. Although the academic community has recognized the leading position of Marxism since liberation, the influence of the Hu Shi faction in the field of classical literature research has still not been duly purged.

    The seriousness of the problem lies here.

    Now is the time to purge bourgeois viewpoints and methods in this field. Since the first shot of the vanguard has been fired, the firepower must be aimed at Hu Shi, the head of bourgeois idealism.

    In his early years, Hu Shi participated in the May Fourth Movement as a representative of bourgeois intellectuals, constituting the right wing of the May Fourth Movement, and formed a united front with left-wing communist intellectuals and other revolutionary intellectuals. Hu Shi also played a certain role in the enlightenment movement against feudal culture and advocating science and democracy. But even then, Hu Shi's thought reflected both the progressive and compromising aspects of the bourgeoisie. After the May Fourth Movement, the intellectual circles began to split, and the development of the revolutionary situation frightened the right-wing bourgeois intellectuals. Hu Shi and his ilk soon turned to the counter-revolutionary side, becoming scholars employed by the comprador bourgeoisie and sworn enemies of Marxism.

    Hu Shi was a disciple of pragmatism. He desperately promoted this philosophy in Chinese cultural circles to resist Marxism, and in fact, many people were captured by him. What is pragmatism? Pragmatism is a branch of the declining bourgeois philosophy that developed in the United States in the early twentieth century and is one of the most prevalent reactionary trends in the current imperialist camp.

    Is pragmatism ultimately idealism or materialism? Pragmatists attempt to avoid answering this question. The pragmatist Dewey declared that questions such as the relationship between thought and existence are "old questions" that are "not worth discussing." Hu Shi said:

    Dewey is a great revolutionary in the history of philosophy. Why?

    Because he fundamentally erased all the fundamental philosophical problems of modern European philosophy since Hume and Kant, and considered them all unworthy of discussion. All debates between rationalists and empiricists, all debates between idealists and materialists, all epistemologies since Kant, in Dewey's eyes, are non-problems, and can all be "left unresolved." ("Pragmatism")

    But in fact, this fundamental philosophical question cannot be "erased" by Dewey, and any attempt to evade this "old" question is futile. A little analysis of the theories of Dewey and his ilk reveals that they are actually peddling idealism and agnosticism behind the names of "experience" and "experiment."

    What is matter? Another pragmatist, James, answered very bluntly:

    The only matter we know is the collection of sensations we have of color, shape, hardness, etc. These sensations are precisely the value of the concept of matter.... This concept is the name of a certain combination of our many sensations, therefore it is real. (James: "Pragmatism")

    This is precisely the resurrection of Berkeley's "to be is to be perceived" and the translation of Mach's "matter is the synthesis of sensations." This is unadulterated subjective idealism!

    Dewey's position is more concealed than James's, and the wording is more subtle, but he cannot avoid showing his true colors:

    Matter is not the cause and origin of phenomena or processes; it is not the absolute master, nor is it the principle for explaining things; it is not the ontology hidden behind changes. This name refers to an active property, not a substance. (Dewey: "Experience and Nature")

    See, matter is not the cause of things and processes, but only a mysterious "active property"! Dewey fled around, but finally could not escape the fundamental question of idealism and materialism, only to appear exhausted.

    The central content of pragmatism lies in its theory of truth and methodology. The pragmatist proposition "what is useful is truth" and "effect is the standard of truth" has a great effect of deceiving the eye, as if this theory is scientific and materialist. However, to judge a philosophy, one cannot simply base it on the signboard hung by the philosophy itself, but must look at how this philosophy solves the fundamental questions of philosophy. Simply admitting that effect is the standard of truth is not materialism. The question is: is the "truth" understood by pragmatists a reflection of the laws of the objective world? What is their so-called "practice" and "effect"? Let's take a look at Hu Shi's introduction:

    Truth is originally man-made, for man-made, made for people to use, and it is because they are very useful that they are given the beautiful name of "truth." ("Pragmatism") That absolute truth is suspended in the air, abstract, general, has no basis, and cannot be verified.... Let us not ask about that absolute ultimate truth for the time being, but only ask how we should deal with him at this time, encountering this situation. The method of dealing with this situation is "this truth." (Ibid.)

    From this, it can be seen that pragmatism denies the objectivity of truth, denies absolute truth, and believes that truth is only a "man-made" "method" for dealing with the environment. This immediately exposes the idealist essence of pragmatism. In fact, under the premise of denying the existence of objective truth, the "utility" of the pragmatists does not mean that truth conforms to objective existence, but only means subjective satisfaction. It is true that truth is useful, but not everything useful is truth, because erroneous reactionary theories are also useful to the reactionary class. In the eyes of pragmatists, any theory and thought, as long as it suits their subjective purposes and interests, can be declared as "truth." We can smell a stench of American businessmen and ruling groups in this argument. Just as Marx pointed out long ago in *Capital*, for the educated lackeys of the bourgeoisie, "the question is no longer whether this theory or that theory conforms to the truth, but only whether it is beneficial or harmful, convenient or inconvenient to capital."

    The "practice" referred to by pragmatism is precisely the kind of "practice" understood by the profit-seeking bourgeoisie—a narrow, egoistic, biological-viewpoint "practice" that deals with the environment, not social revolutionary practice. From such "practice," one can only learn some fragmentary knowledge and the sophisticated philosophy of life of the exploiting class, and there is no way to understand the laws of social development.

    Hu Shi summarized the method of pragmatism as "bold hypothesis, careful verification." Hypothesis and verification were originally methods that existed early in the history of science and were not new inventions of pragmatism. The question here is not whether hypothesis and verification are needed. The question here is: is this method the only and highest method? Hu Shi regards hypothesis and verification as the highest method, and he does not understand the limitations of this method at all. In fact, the process of hypothesis and verification that Hu Shi refers to is nothing more than a synthesis of formal logic's deduction and induction. In a narrow range, when studying simple and ordinary relationships of things, this formal logic method may still be able to cope; once it exceeds this boundary, to deeply study the essence and internal contradictions of things, to grasp the development of the surrounding world, this elementary formal logic is powerless, and it is necessary to apply advanced logic—dialectical logic.

    The more important question is: under what worldview are these hypotheses and verifications carried out? Is it bourgeois idealism or proletarian materialism? Whether scientists like it or not, whether they are conscious or not, when making hypotheses, when making certain general conclusions, they are always influenced by a certain philosophical point of view. We know that many scholars in bourgeois countries have given idealist explanations to the new discoveries of modern science, creating a crisis in science. It can be seen that methodology cannot be separated from worldview. Without the guidance of dialectical materialism, the method of hypothesis and verification will also go astray. Hu Shi's own thought is also living evidence.

    Hu Shi himself said that his remarks and propositions are "only this kind of application of the pragmatic attitude in all aspects" ("My Divergence"). Then let's see how this magic weapon "works."

    If in the realm of worldview, in the realm of natural science, Hu Shi can still somewhat conceal his idealist position, then once he steps into the realm of social science, Hu Shi completely exposes himself as a historical idealist. Hu Shi's purpose was to resist Marxism. He made this very clear himself in an article in 1922:

    ... The "new" elements in the country keep silent about specific political issues, but talk a lot about anarchism and Marxism. I couldn't stand it, I couldn't help it—because I am a believer in pragmatism—so I was determined to talk about politics. ("My Divergence")

    This is Hu Shi's position, and this position determines that Hu Shi cannot recognize the truth. No matter how someone flaunts "scientific methods" and "historical attitude," as long as he stands on a reactionary position, as long as he wants to hinder the inevitable trend of social development, he will certainly not be objective, and he must carry out deception. How did Hu Shi view the fundamental problems of Chinese society at that time, the aggression of imperialism and the oppression of feudal forces? According to Hu Shi, there was no imperialist aggression at all:

    Don't always say that imperialists have harmed us. That's our own self-deception! ("Please Everyone Come and Look in the Mirror") I am not willing to pile all the crimes on the heads of foreign devils.

    ... If we want to save the country, we should reflect on ourselves,... refusing to reflect and only blaming others is solid evidence of our own shamelessness and lack of competitiveness. ("Letters Sent on the Road in Europe") Nor was there any rule of feudal forces: The biggest problem in the country now is not warlords and evil bureaucrats. ("My Divergence") The feudal system had already collapsed two thousand years ago. ("Which Road Do We Take?") Look! Hu Shi is shameless to this extent! He utters "respect facts, respect evidence" at every turn, but when facts and evidence are placed before his eyes, he suddenly closes his eyes. Of course, denying imperialist aggression and the oppression of feudal forces is "useful" for the class interests that Hu Shi wants to maintain, so he can think that this is "truth." According to his "logic," China first had "five ghosts making trouble in China" (poverty, disease, ignorance, corruption, and unrest), so it attracted imperialist aggression. As for why China is poor, etc., no one knows.

    Hu Shi was a vulgar evolutionist, and he used this theory as the basis for his political reformism. He opposed revolution and opposed class struggle. He said:

    Pragmatism focuses on concrete facts and problems, so it does not recognize fundamental solutions. He only recognizes the progress made bit by bit, - step by step with wise guidance, step by step with automatic experiments, - is true evolution. ("My Divergence") Hu Shi believed that the driving force of historical development was not the contradiction between productive forces and relations of production, nor class struggle, but things like knowledge and morality. Therefore, he advocated saving the country by "starting with thought and learning" ("Letters Sent on the Road in Europe"), advocating "good people politics," and promoting education to save the country. He praised the feudal ruler's slave Wu Xun to the highest degree:

    There was a beggar Wu Xun in Shandong. He begged for food all his life, saved money and ran elementary schools;... At that time, the whole country knew the great name of "righteous beggar Wu Xun." This story can best express the fanaticism of the people of that era towards education. ("The Method of Relief for Educational Bankruptcy is Still Education")

    It is not surprising that Hu Shi appreciates Wu Xun. Wu Xun is suitable for the purpose of Hu Shi's reformist propaganda, and he is also suitable for his purpose of instilling slave thinking into the people.

    Hu Shi was a propagator of imperialist slave thinking. He spread national inferiority complex and pro-American and worship-American thinking in many articles. He worshiped the capitalist civilization of the United States with all his heart: "The benefits of motorcycle civilization are truly indescribable." "Everyone can be a propertied class, so the agitation of class warfare is ineffective." ("Impressions of Wandering") He held a nihilistic and negative attitude towards the cultural heritage of his own motherland. He said: "Our inherent culture is really very poor, and there is no talk of the dream of 'too rich'." ("Confidence and Reflection") He said that the greatest achievement of his sorting out the history of Chinese philosophy was to make people understand that these things were "just so-so" ("Sorting out the National Heritage and 'Fighting Ghosts'") As for classical literature, "From the perspective of literary methods, Chinese literature is really not enough for us to use as a model." ("On the Constructive Literary Revolution") What is so great about ancient Chinese culture? Hu Shi thought for twenty years and only came up with three points of his so-called "strengths": "The simplest and most reasonable grammar, the social structure of popularization, and the weak religious heart." In addition, he "really can't think of any other strengths." ("Three Discussions on Confidence and Reflection") Because of this, he absurdly advocated "complete Westernization." (Although he later changed to a better-sounding term "full modernization", the essence is the same.)

    How did Hu Shi's position, views and methods influence the research of classical literature? Why is this bourgeois idealism?

    First, this is the theory detached from reality, academic detached from politics.

    People may wonder, since in Hu Shi's eyes, ancient Chinese culture "is not worth the dream of 'too rich'," then why did he advocate "sorting out the national heritage"? Hu Shi had ulterior motives in this. Hu Shi himself was keen on politics, but he wanted to pretend to be "aloof" and hoped that academics would not get involved in politics, but bury themselves in the so-called "pure academic" research. He advised others to do scholarship to "have an attitude of 'seeking truth for the sake of truth'," and not to have any preconceived notions of 'useful or useless'. "The nature of 'National Heritage Studies' is nothing more than to understand the national heritage, which is required by human nature to seek knowledge. If it is said that it is 'to meet the needs of the times', it is the ancient people's dream of 'achieving peace by understanding the classics'." ("On National Heritage Studies") Why did Hu Shi himself study *Dream of the Red Chamber* and *Water Margin*? He himself said: "I want to teach people a method of thinking and learning." ("Lushan Travel Notes") "My hundreds of thousands of words of novel research are just using some 'profound and clear' examples to teach people how to think." ("Introducing My Own Thoughts") This means that the research is for the sake of research, and the method is for the sake of method. Because of this, the object of research is not important, "the authenticity of a tower has the same consideration value as Sun Yat-sen's will." ("Lushan Travel Notes") "Scholarship is equal. Inventing the ancient meaning of a word is as great an achievement as discovering a star."

    This attitude is also Yu Pingbo's attitude. Yu Pingbo himself said that his research on literature is "just a study of interest," "appreciating literature and attaching a little research is just acting on occasion" ("Revision of *Dream of the Red Chamber*"). In his book "*Dream of the Red Chamber* Research," Yu Pingbo spent seventeen pages savoring the details of the number of people, seating arrangements, and drinking games at the "Shou Yihong Gathering of Flowers at Night Banquet," while he barely touched on the era significance and social content of *Dream of the Red Chamber*, which also shows where his "interest" lies.

    Second, it is the view of "pure literature and art" and the attitude of objectivism.

    The bourgeois view of literature and art denies that literature and art are a superstructure based on the economic system, denies that literary works are a reflection of social reality, and denies the class nature of literature. Bourgeois literary critics regard literature and art as isolated things, as things that describe abstract "human nature," and as things that are beyond class struggle. This determines that they take things like "skills," "plot," "writing style," and "interest" as the criteria for their literary criticism. What is literature? Hu Shi replied that the basic function of literature is to express meaning and emotion, "expressing meaning well and expressing emotion wonderfully is literature." ("What is Literature") In this way, the significance of the actual struggle of various literary works is ignored, and a uniform objectivist attitude is naturally held towards the positive and negative typical characters in literary works.

    This is how Yu Pingbo views *Dream of the Red Chamber*. Therefore, he believes that *Dream of the Red Chamber* is nothing more than "a biography of boudoirs and chambers," "Although this book also involves ethnic, political, and social issues, the main object is still the family, the feudal landlord family that is about to collapse." (It only "involves" social issues, rather than making an accusation of the crimes of feudal society through the tragedy of a family.) Yu Pingbo described his so-called "erroneous" attitude towards literature and art, saying: "Society likes to have contrasting comparisons the most. On the stage, there is a red face, and there must be a black face to accompany him,... When I was a child, listening to people tell stories, I would eagerly ask, 'Who is the good person? Who is the bad person?' I feel that this is the most important and most exciting point in the novel." ("*Dream of the Red Chamber* Research") Therefore, he opposes people seeing *Dream of the Red Chamber* as "everywhere there is praise and criticism," and he agrees with Jiang Shunyi's words, "What is recorded in *Dream of the Red Chamber* is all the words of the children in the boudoir,... What is destruction? What is slander?" He believes that Dai and Chai should be treated equally, "Only in this way can the love scene be the most prosperous, only in this way can the writing be the most wonderful." (Note: this is for the "prosperity of the love scene" and the "wonderfulness of the writing"!)

    What a pair of eyes of an objectivist literary "appreciation"ist! Yu Pingbo studied *Dream of the Red Chamber* for thirty years, but he did not see the extravagance and licentiousness of the feudal bureaucratic family described in the book, the hypocrisy and cruelty of the upper ruling class. He only felt that "exposure and criticism are not enough," "although derogatory, why is he not emotionally exposed"; he was not moved by the deep sympathy that the author of *Dream of the Red Chamber* placed on the pure love of Baoyu and Daiyu, and only felt that "the meaning of support and praise is originally very small," "although praised, when did he really sing praises"!

    Yu Pingbo greatly appreciated the so-called "resentful but not angry" style of *Dream of the Red Chamber*. In his view, *Golden Lotus* is not as good as *Dream of the Red Chamber* because it "is clearly a book of slander, and it is indeed written for a reason." In other words, writing novels should not be ruthlessly exposed, and there should be no purpose. He believes that the writing style of "accumulating sorrowful thoughts" is higher than that of "containing anger." He is not very satisfied with *Water Margin* because there is too much "anger" in *Water Margin*, which somewhat clashed with his gentleman's peace and tranquility, "somewhat excessive" and "showing off its sharpness." In this way, it seems that when objectivists see "non-objective" literature and art, their attitude is not so "objective."

    Objectivists seem to be objective, but they are not actually objective, because they attempt to obliterate the objective fact that people and literature have class nature, so it is also a manifestation of subjectivism. The objectivist position is the bourgeois position. Lenin said: "Non-partisanship is the thought of the bourgeoisie. Partisanship is the thought of socialism." Only dialectical materialists, on the one hand, implement deep partisanship, and on the other hand, have the most objective attitude.

    Third, it is a formalist and subjective research method.

    The method of pragmatists has been criticized earlier. Here, let's take a concrete look at how Hu Shi used the method of pragmatism to "sort out the national heritage."

    Hu Shi boasted that his method of "sorting out the national heritage" was a scientific method, and he repeatedly emphasized "systematic sorting out" and "historical vision." What is "systematic sorting out"? Hu Shi explained in the "Declaration of Publication of the National Heritage Quarterly":

    (A) Index-style sorting.
    (B) Account-style sorting. (Contribute the problems that have been solved; raise the problems that have not been solved.)
    (C) Special history-style sorting. (Categorized) We can say in other words, it is to compile a dictionary, list an account, and compile an encyclopedia. This is called "systematic sorting out." Adding comparison and textual research constitutes the entire "scientific method" of studying history! Here, the worldview is not needed, and the knowledge of the laws of social development is not needed. It is easy to see that this kind of sorting work is only classifying according to the external signs of things, and it is only the accumulation of materials. This method can at most achieve "removing the crude and taking the essence, removing the false and keeping the truth," and it is still far from "going from this to that, from the surface to the inside." But Hu Shi and his ilk are still complacent!

    The one-sidedness and superficiality of this method can be seen in Yu Pingbo's research work.

    Yu Pingbo also has Hu Shi's so-called "historical vision." Based on the two concepts of "color" and "emptiness," he judged that *Dream of the Red Chamber* was derived from *Golden Lotus*; discovering that *Dream of the Red Chamber* quoted *Romance of the West Chamber* in certain chapters and sentences, he believed that *Dream of the Red Chamber* was "originally *Romance of the West Chamber*"; based on Miaoyu's praise of Zhuangzi and Baoyu's saying fragrant grass, he asserted that *Dream of the Red Chamber* inherited "Zhuangzi" and "Chu Ci." These are all "evidence," but unfortunately, this is just playing with examples and looking at the problem from the form. Yu Pingbo also has an "attitude of textual research." "Daiyu died young due to physical weakness, and Baoyu became a monk due to poverty." Aren't these "books as proof"? The decline of the Jia family is due to confiscation of property, self-mutilation and dryness. Isn't this clearly stated in the book? The problem is that these are all superficial reasons. According to this kind of analysis, the tragedy of *Dream of the Red Chamber* is entirely caused by accidental reasons. If Daiyu was healthier, she would not die young. Baoyu became a monk due to poverty, and the Jia family was poor due to the cannibalism of relatives, excessive ostentation, etc. What is the cannibalism of relatives, excessive ostentation, etc. due to? Yu Pingbo's analysis ends here. Indeed, the use of "textual research" can only "stop here." Further analysis of the social reasons for the decline of the Jia family, and analysis of the inevitability of the love tragedy of Baoyu and Daiyu, is beyond the ability of "textual research," and it is also beyond the ability of that account-style "historical vision." And unfortunately, the "new Red scholars" did not even think about this issue!

    One-sidedness and superficiality are both subjectivity. Anyone who uses a formalist method to do research work will inevitably commit the fault of subjectivism; and anyone who uses the philosophy of pragmatism as the guiding ideology of their research work will inevitably fall into formalism. Without taking dialectical materialism and historical materialism as a guide, "hypothesis" will become subjective hypothesis, and "evidence" will be superficial evidence.

    Yu Pingbo himself said that researching literature and art is just "acting on occasion," and "if you take a scalpel to cut it open," it is "using a bull knife to kill a chicken." He doesn't understand that he is actually using a chicken knife to slaughter a bull!

    Today, Hu Shi's political thought has completely gone bankrupt with the death of old China. But his "academic thought," his pragmatic philosophy, still influences the academic community. His ghost is still attached to Yu Pingbo and other cultural figures. Recognizing the reactionary nature of Hu Shi's thought and eliminating his influence is the current task of the cultural community.

    清除胡适的反动哲学遗毒
    ——兼评俞平伯研究红楼梦的错误观点和方法
    王若水
    为什么说，对红楼梦研究中的错误观点的批判是“工人阶级对资产阶级在思想战线上的又一次严重斗争”呢？
    古典文学研究的领域，一直是文化战线上的薄弱环节之一。这个阵地，自从资产阶级从封建阶级那里夺取过来以后，三十多年来基本上一直被资产阶级唯心论的代表胡适派占据着。尽管解放后学术界已经承认了马克思主义的领导地位，古典文学研究领域中的胡适派影响却依然没有受到应有的清算。
    问题的严重性就在这里。
    现在是在这个领域中清算资产阶级的观点和方法的时候了。前哨的第一枪既然已经响出，战斗的火力，就不能不对准资产阶级唯心论的头子胡适。
    早年的胡适曾以资产阶级知识分子代表的资格，参加了五四运动，构成五四运动的右翼，和左翼的共产主义的知识分子以及其他革命的知识分子结成了统一战线。在反对封建文化，提倡科学和民主的启蒙运动中，胡适也曾起过一定的作用。但就在那时，胡适的思想也反映了资产阶级的进步和妥协的两面性。五四运动以后，知识界开始分裂，革命形势的发展吓倒了右翼的资产阶级知识分子，胡适这一派人不久就转到了反革命方面，成为官僚买办资产阶级的御用学者，马克思主义的死敌。
    胡适是实验主义的门徒，他拚命在中国文化界宣传这种哲学来对抗马克思主义，而实际上确也有不少人作了他的俘虏。实验主义是什么呢？实验主义是二十世纪初在美国发展起来的资产阶级哲学末流的一个派别，是当今帝国主义阵营最盛行的反动思潮之一。
    实验主义究竟是唯心论还是唯物论呢？对这个问题，实验主义者是企图逃避不答复的。实验主义者杜威宣告说，关于思惟与存在的关系这样的问题，是“不值得讨论”的“老问题”。胡适说：
    杜威在哲学史上是一个大革命家。为什么呢？
    因为他把欧洲近世哲学从休谟（Hume）和康德（Kant）以来的哲学根本问题一齐抹煞，一齐认为没有讨论的价值。一切理性派与经验派的争论，一切唯心论和唯物论的争论，一切从康德以来的知识论，在杜威的眼里，都是不成问题的争论，都可“以不了了之”。（“实验主义”）
    但实际上这个哲学上的根本问题是杜威“抹煞”不了的，任何逃避这个“老”问题的企图都是枉然。稍微分析一下杜威之流的理论，就可以看出他们其实是在“经验”“实验”这些名词后面贩卖着唯心论和不可知论。
    什么是物质呢？另一个实验主义者詹姆斯回答得很干脆：
    我们所知道的物质，不过是我们所有的关于颜色、形状、硬度等的一些感觉。这些感觉恰恰就是物质这个概念所具有的价值。……这一个概念是我们许多感觉的一定组合的名称，因此，它就是真实。（詹姆斯：“实用主义”）
    这正是巴克莱的“存在即是被知觉”的复活，马赫的“物质是感觉的综合”的翻版。这是不折不扣的主观唯心论！
    杜威的立场要比詹姆斯隐蔽一些，词句要巧妙一些，然而也免不了露马脚：
    物质并不是现象或过程的原因和根源；它并不是绝对的主宰，并不是解释事物的原则；它并不是隐蔽在变化后面的本体。这一个名称所指的是一种能动的性质，而不是一种实质。（杜威：“经验与自然”）
    请看，物质并不是事物和过程的原因，只是一种莫名其妙的“能动的性质”！杜威逃来逃去，终于逃不掉唯心唯物的根本问题，只是显得心劳日拙而已。
    实验主义的中心内容在它的真理论和方法论。实验主义的“有用的就是真理”“效果是真理的标准”的命题，有很大的迷惑眼目的作用，仿佛这种理论是科学的，唯物的。但是，评判一种哲学，不能单根据这种哲学自己所挂的招牌，而要看这种哲学怎样解决哲学的根本问题。单单承认效果是真理的标准，这还不就是唯物论。问题在于：实验主义者所理解的“真理”是不是客观世界规律性的反映？他们所谓的“实践”和“效果”是什么？请看看胡适的介绍：
    真理原来是人造的，是为了人造的，是人造出来供人用的，是因为他们大有用处所以才给他们“真理”的美名的。（“实验主义”）那绝对的真理是悬空的，是抽象的，是笼统的，是没有凭据的，是不能证实的。……我们现在且莫问那绝对究竟的真理，只须问我们在这个时候，遇着这个境地，应该怎样对付他。这种对付这个境地的方法，便是“这个真理”。（同上）
    由此可见，实验主义否认真理的客观性，否认绝对真理，认为真理只是“人造出来的”对付环境的“方法”。这就一下暴露了实验主义的唯心论实质。实际上，在否认客观真理存在的前提下，实验主义者所谓的“效用”，并不意味着真理与客观存在的符合，而只意味着主观的满意。不错，真理都是有用的，但有用的并不都是真理，因为错误的反动理论对反动阶级来说也是有用的。在实验主义者看来，任何理论和思想，只要适合他们的主观目的和利益，便可以宣布为“真理”。在这种论调里我们可以嗅出一股美国生意人和统治集团的臭味。正像马克思老早在资本论中指出的，对于资产阶级有学问的走狗们，“已经不是这个理论还是那个理论合于真理的问题，只是它于资本有益还是有害，便利还是不便利”。
      实验主义所指的“实践”，正是唯利是图的资产阶级所理解的那种“实践”——狭隘的、利己的、应付环境的生物学观点的“实践”，而不是社会的革命的实践。从这样的“实践”里，只能学到一些零碎片断的知识和圆滑的剥削阶级的处世哲学，根本谈不上对社会发展规律的了解。
    胡适把实验主义的方法概括为“大胆的假设，小心的求证”。假设和求证本是科学史上早有的方法，并不是实验主义的新发明。这里问题不在于是否需要假设和求证。这里问题是在于：这种方法是不是唯一的、最高的方法？胡适把假设和求证当作最高的方法，他根本不懂得这种方法的局限性。实际上胡适所谓的假设和求证的过程不过是形式逻辑的演绎和归纳的综合。在狭隘的范围里，在研究事物的简单的、寻常的关系时，这种形式逻辑的方法也许还可以应付；一超出这个界限，要深入研究事物的本质和内在矛盾，要把握周围世界的发展时，这种初等的形式逻辑就无能为力了，就必须应用高级的逻辑——辩证逻辑了。
    更重要的问题是：这里的假设和求证，是在什么世界观指导下进行的？是资产阶级唯心论还是无产阶级唯物论？不管科学家喜欢不喜欢，不管他们自觉不自觉，在进行假设时，在作出某些概括性的结论时，他们总是要受某一种哲学观点的影响的。我们知道，资产阶级国家许多学者都把现代科学的新发现作了唯心的解释，造成了科学的危机。可见，方法论不能脱离世界观。离开了辩证唯物论的指导，假设和求证的方法也会走上歧路。胡适本人的思想，也是活生生的证据。
    胡适自己说，他的言论主张“只是这一种实验主义的态度在各方面的应用”（“我的歧路”）。那么且看看这个法宝的“效果”如何吧。
    如果在世界观方面，在自然科学方面，胡适还多少能隐蔽他的唯心论立场的话，那么一踏进社会科学的领域，胡适就完全暴露了他是一个历史唯心论者。胡适的目的是抵制马克思主义。关于这一点，他自己在一九二二年的一篇文章里说得很明白：
    ……国内的“新”分子闭口不谈具体的政治问题，却高谈什么无政府主义与马克思主义。我看不过了，忍不住了，——因为我是一个实验主义的信徒，——于是发愤要想谈政治。（“我的歧路”）
    这就是胡适的立场，这个立场就决定了胡适不能够认识真理。不管谁怎样标榜“科学的方法”，“历史的态度”，只要他是站在反动的立场上，只要他是想阻碍社会发展的必然趋势，他就一定不能客观，他就一定要进行欺骗。对于当时中国社会的根本问题，对于帝国主义的侵略和封建势力的压迫，胡适是怎么看的呢？据胡适看来，原来根本就没有什么帝国主义侵略：
    不要尽说是帝国主义者害了我们。那是我们自己欺骗自己的话！（“请大家来照照镜子”）我是不肯把一切罪状都堆到洋鬼子头上的。
    ……我们要救国应该自己反省，……不肯反省，只责备别人，就是自己不要脸，不争气的铁证。（“欧游道中寄书”）也没有什么封建势力的统治：现在国中最大的病根，并不是军阀与恶官僚。（“我的歧路”）封建制度早已在二千年前崩坏了。（“我们走那条路”）请看！胡适就是无耻到这种程度！口口声声“尊重事实，尊重证据”，待到事实和证据摆在他眼前，他却忽然闭上眼睛了。当然，否认帝国主义的侵略和封建势力的压迫，对胡适所要维护的阶级利益来说，是“有用”的，因此他可以认为这就是“真理”。按他的“逻辑”，中国首先是因为有“五鬼闹中华”（贫穷、疾病、愚昧、贪污、扰乱），所以才招来了帝国主义的侵略。至于中国为什么贫穷等等，那是谁也不知道的。
    胡适是庸俗进化论者，他用这种理论作为他的政治上的改良主义的根据。他反对革命，反对阶级斗争。他说：
    实验主义注重在具体的事实与问题，故不承认根本的解决。他只承认那一点一滴做到的进步，——步步有智慧的指导，步步有自动的实验，——才是真进化。（“我的歧路”）胡适认为历史发展动力不是生产力和生产关系的矛盾，不是阶级斗争，而是知识道德一类的东西。所以他主张救国要“从思想学问下手”（“欧游道中寄书”），提倡“好人政治”，宣传教育救国。对于封建统治者的奴才武训，他赞扬备至：
    山东有一个乞丐武训，他终身讨饭，积下钱来就去办小学堂；……当时全国人都知道“义丐武训”的大名。这件故事，最可以表示那个时代的人对于教育的狂热。（“教育破产的救济方法还是教育”）
    胡适赏识武训，这是不足怪的，武训正适合胡适的改良主义宣传的目的，也正适合他向人民灌输奴化思想的目的。
    胡适是帝国主义奴化思想的传播者。他在许多文章里散布民族自卑感，散布亲美崇美思想。对于美国的资本主义文明，他崇拜得五体投地：“摩托车的文明的好处真是一言难尽。”“人人都可以做有产阶级，故阶级战争的煽动不发生效力。”（“漫游的感想”）对于自己祖国的文化遗产，他却抱着虚无主义的否定态度。他说：“我们的固有文化实在是很贫乏的，谈不到‘太丰富’的梦话。”（“信心与反省”）他说他整理中国哲学史的最大成绩，是使人明白这些东西“不过如此”（“整理国故与‘打鬼’”）至于古典文学呢，“从文学方法一方面看去，中国的文学实在不够给我们作模范。”（“建设的文学革命论”）中国古代的文化究竟有什么伟大呢？胡适想了二十年，只想出三点他所谓的“优长”：“最简易合理的文法，平民化的社会构造，薄弱的宗教心”，此外他“实在想不出什么别的优长之点了。”（“三论信心与反省”）正因为这样，所以他荒谬地主张“全盘西化”。（虽然他后来换了一个较好听的“充分现代化”的名词，但实质是一样的。）
    胡适的立场、观点和方法怎样影响了古典文学的研究呢？为什么说这是资产阶级唯心论呢？
    第一，这就是理论脱离实际，学术脱离政治。
    人们或许会奇怪，既然在胡适的眼里，中国古代文化“谈不到‘太丰富’的梦话”，那么他为什么要提倡“整理国故”呢？这在胡适是有不可告人的目的的。胡适自己是热中于政治的，但是他却要伪装“清高”，并且希望学术家不要过问政治，埋头于所谓“纯学术”的研究中。他劝别人做学问要“存一个‘为真理而求真理’的态度”，不要有什么‘有用无用’的成见”。“‘国故学’的性质不外乎要懂得国故，这是人类求知的天性所要求的。若说是‘应时势之需’，便是古人‘通经而致治平’的梦想了。”（“论国故学”）胡适自己为什么要考证红楼梦和水浒传呢？他自己说：“我要教人一个思想学问的方法。”（“庐山游记”）“我的几十万字的小说考证，都只是用一些‘深切而著明’的实例来教人怎样思想。”（“介绍我自己的思想”）这意思就是说，为考证而考证，为方法而方法。正因为这样，研究的对象是不重要的，“一个塔的真伪同孙中山的遗嘱有同等的考虑价值。”（“庐山游记”）“学问是平等的。发明一个字的古义，与发现一颗恒星，都是一大功绩。”
    这种态度，也正是俞平伯的态度。俞平伯自己说，他对文学的研究“只是趣味的研究”，“欣赏文艺时附带一点研究，亦只是逢场作戏而已”（“红楼梦辨的修正”）。俞平伯在“红楼梦研究”一书中不惜用十七页篇幅津津有味地考证“寿怡红群芳开夜宴”的人数、席次、行令等等琐节，而对于红楼梦的时代意义和社会内容，却简直没有触及到，也可见他的“趣味”何在了。
    第二，是“纯文艺”的观点和客观主义的态度。
    资产阶级的文学观否认文艺是以经济制度为基础的上层建筑，否认文学作品是社会现实生活的反映，否认文学的阶级性。资产阶级文艺批评家把文艺当作孤立的东西，当作描写抽象“人性”的东西，当作超乎阶级斗争之外的东西。这就决定了他们把“技巧”“情节”“笔法”“趣味”一类的东西作为他们的文艺批评的标准。什么是文学呢？胡适回答说，文学的基本作用是达意表情，“达意达的好，表情表的妙，便是文学。”（“什么是文学”）这样一来，对各种文学作品的现实斗争意义便视而不见了，对文学作品中的正反面典型人物，也自然抱着一视同仁的客观主义态度了。
      俞平伯就是这样看待红楼梦的。所以他认为红楼梦不过是“闺阁庭帏之传”，“本书虽亦牵涉种族政治社会问题，但主要的对象还是家庭，行将崩溃的封建地主家庭。”（只是“牵涉”到社会问题，而不是透过一个家庭的悲剧提出对封建社会罪恶的控诉。）俞平伯叙述他所认为“错误”的对文艺的态度说：“社会上最喜欢有相反的对照。戏台上有一个红面孔，必跟着个黑面孔来陪他，……我小时候听人讲小说，必很急切地问道，‘那个是好人？那个是坏人？’觉得这是小说中最重要，并且最精采的一点。”（“红楼梦研究”）因此，他反对人家把红楼梦看成“处处都有褒贬”，他同意地引证江顺怡的话说，“红楼梦所记皆闺房儿女之语，……何所谓毁？何所谓谤？”他认为应该把黛钗平等看待，“必如此方极情场之盛，必如此方尽文章之妙。”（注意：这是为了“情场之盛”和“文章之妙”！）
    好一副客观主义的文艺“欣赏”家的眼睛！俞平伯把红楼梦研究了三十年，可是书中描写的封建官僚家庭的奢侈淫乱，上层统治阶级的虚伪残忍，他都没有看见，他只觉得“暴露批判又觉不够”，“虽贬，他何尝无情暴露”；红楼梦作者对宝玉黛玉纯洁恋爱所寄予的深切同情，他也没有感动，只觉得“拥护赞美的意思原很少”，“虽褒，他几时当真歌颂”！
    俞平伯对红楼梦的所谓“怨而不怒”的风格，大加赞赏。在他看来，金瓶梅之不如红楼梦，是因为它“明是一部谤书，确是有所为而作的”。换句话说，就是写小说不要无情的暴露，不要有什么目的。他认为“积哀思”的文章风格要比“含怒气”的高。他是不很满意水浒的，因为水浒中的“怒气”太多，有点冲撞了他的绅士的安详，“有些过火”、“锋芒毕露”。这样看来，客观主义者一看到“不客观”的文艺时，态度也就不那么“客观”了。
    客观主义者貌似客观，其实并不客观，因为他企图抹煞人和文学的阶级性这一客观事实，因此它也是主观主义的一种表现。客观主义的立场是资产阶级的立场。列宁说：“非党派性是资产阶级的思想。党派性是社会主义的思想。”只有辩证唯物主义者一方面贯彻了深刻的党性，另一方面又有最客观的态度。
    第三，是形式主义的主观的研究方法。
    前面已经批评过实验主义者的方法。这里再来具体地看看胡适怎样运用实验主义的方法来“整理国故”吧。
    胡适自诩他“整理国故”的方法是科学的方法，他再三强调“系统的整理”，“历史的眼光”。什么是“系统的整理”呢？胡适在“国学季刊发刊宣言”里解释说：
      （甲）索引式的整理。
      （乙）结账式的整理。（把已经解决的问题贡献出来；把没有解决的问题提出来。）
      （丙）专史式的整理。（分门别类）我们可以换句话说，就是编一部词典，列一笔账，集成一部百科全书。这就叫“系统的整理”。再加上比较和考证，就构成全部研究历史的“科学方法”！在这里，世界观是用不着的，社会发展规律的知识是用不着的。很容易看出，这种整理工作，只是按照事物的外部标志来分类，只是材料的堆积。这种方法顶多只能做到“去粗取精、去伪存真”，至于“由此及彼、由表及里”还差得很。而胡适之流却还洋洋得意哩！
    这种方法的片面性和表面性，在俞平伯的研究工作中可以看出来。
    俞平伯也是有胡适所谓“历史的眼光”的。他根据“色”“空”两个观念，就判定红楼梦从金瓶梅脱胎而来；发现红楼梦某些章节文句中引用西厢记，就认为红楼梦“原本西厢”；更根据妙玉赞庄子，宝玉说香草等，就断言红楼梦继承了“庄子”“楚辞”。这都是有“证据”的，可惜这只是玩弄例子，只是从形式上看问题。俞平伯也是有“考据的态度”的。“黛玉因体弱而夭折，宝玉为贫穷而出家”，这不都是“有书为证”的么？贾氏衰败是由于抄家，自残和枯干，这难道不是在书里说得明明白白的么？问题在于，这都是表面的原因。照这种分析，红楼梦的悲剧便完全是偶然原因造成的。黛玉如果身体健康一点，她就不致于夭折了。宝玉出家是由于贫穷，贾氏贫穷是由于骨肉相残、排场过大等等。骨肉相残、排场过大等等又是由于什么呢？俞平伯的分析到此为止了。实在，“考据”的用处，也只能“到此止步”了。进一步分析贾家衰败的社会原因，分析宝玉黛玉恋爱悲剧的必然性，是“考据”无能为力的，也是那种列账式的“历史的眼光”无能为力的。而且可惜的是，“新红学家”们连想都没有想到这个问题！
    片面性和表面性，都是主观性。凡是用形式主义的方法来做研究工作的人，一定会犯主观主义的毛病；而凡是用实验主义的哲学来作为自己研究工作的指导思想的人，一定会陷入形式主义。不把辩证唯物论和历史唯物论作为指南，“假设”就会变成主观的假设，“证据”就会是表面的证据。
    俞平伯自己说，研究文艺只是“逢场作戏”，“若拿了一把解剖刀来大割”，就是“割鸡焉用牛刀”。他不懂得，他实际上是在用鸡刀来宰牛！
    在今天，胡适的政治思想已随着旧中国的死亡而彻底破产了。但他的“学术思想”，他的实验主义哲学，却还影响着学术界。他的幽灵还附在俞平伯和其他一部分文化界人士的身上。认清胡适思想的反动性，清除他的影响，是文化界当前的任务。
