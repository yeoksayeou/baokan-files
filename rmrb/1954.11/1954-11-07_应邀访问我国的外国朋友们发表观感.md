Impressions of Professor Bachtiar Effendi, President of the Indonesian Red Cross Society and Director of the Central Hospital of Jakarta
Professor Bachtiar Effendi, President of the Indonesian Red Cross Society and Director of the Central Hospital of Jakarta, told a "Newspaper" reporter on the 2nd about his recent visit to China, saying that when he visited Shenyang, Anshan, and other places, he saw Chinese workers living in neatly constructed new worker dormitories with good ventilation and ample water and electricity.

He said that due to the restoration of social order and the distribution of land, Chinese farmers are now able to enjoy a peaceful life that they have not had for the past hundred years. Health clinics have been established in rural areas. Coupled with the mass patriotic health movement, rural health conditions have been greatly improved. He said that during his travels in China, he saw that every street and every train was very clean. After traveling five thousand miles in China, he concluded that construction work is progressing rapidly in China, and the people's lives are stable and secure. He said that the Chinese people live a simple and abundant life, and the diligence of Chinese workers and farmers is admirable.

He said that a major problem facing China is the lack of sufficient medical personnel to meet the needs of its 600 million people. Efforts are currently being made to overcome this difficulty. He said that China has made tremendous achievements in improving people's health conditions.

Chief Editor of Antara News Agency
Jahja, the Chief Editor of the Indonesian Antara News Agency, who had just visited the People's Republic of China, commented on what he saw in New China in a series of articles. Jahja wrote: It cannot be denied by anyone that the Chinese people are effectively and rapidly carrying out their construction work and have achieved truly amazing results.

When talking about the reasons why China has made such great progress in such a short period of time, Jahja wrote: "Mobilizing the masses and relying on the masses is their fundamental principle. Relying on the strength of the people, China has eliminated the forces of imperialism, feudalism, and compradorism. China also relied on the strength of the people to eradicate corruption, waste, bureaucracy, prostitution, and bribery, which were very prevalent under Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang regime. The Kuomintang regime was destroyed because it did not receive the support of the people."

Jahja wrote in his article: The achievements China has made in the past five years show that the state system adopted by China is in line with the new historical conditions.

When talking about the good public security situation in China, Jahja wrote that some people suggested that this good social order is due to pressure and strict control. However, the people of this country have been fighting for hundreds of years against the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and have experienced continuous wars. It is hard to imagine that a good social order and public security situation is the result of the people fearing intimidation or oppression. He said that, on the contrary, it means that the Chinese people support the current government.

Jahja wrote that the Chinese people do not think that their country is as perfect as "heaven." They everywhere ask foreign guests for their opinions. The Chinese people, including their leaders, lead a simple life, concentrating their efforts on construction, industrialization, and the establishment of a socialist society. New public morals are changing the way of life in Chinese society.

Head of the Pakistani Women's Delegation
Mrs. Shah Nawaz, the head of the Pakistani women's delegation who was invited to China to participate in the National Day celebrations, and some members of the delegation returned to Pakistan on October 27. According to the "Dawn" newspaper: Mrs. Shah Nawaz told reporters that their trip to China was very satisfactory, and they were very grateful for the courtesy and hospitality shown by the Chinese government and people. When talking about the life of Muslims in China, she said: "There are 80,000 Muslims in Beijing, and they all live happily. They are making progress day by day under the leadership of the People's Government." She said: They visited mosques in Beijing, and the temples were well preserved. There are also many Muslim residents in Nanjing and other large cities, and they are in good economic and educational condition.

Mrs. Shah Nawaz said: They visited many important cities in China. The Chinese people are very interested in Pakistan and hope to learn more about this country.

    应邀访问我国的外国朋友们发表观感
    印度尼西亚红十字会会长
    印度尼西亚红十字会会长兼雅加达中央医院院长巴赫德尔·约翰教授二日对“新报”记者谈他最近访问中国的观感说，他在参观沈阳、鞍山和其他地方时，看到了中国工人住在修建得整整齐齐的新的工人宿舍里，房间通风条件很好，并且有充足的水电供应。
    他说，由于社会治安的恢复以及田地的分配，中国农民现在能享受过去一百年来所没有的和平生活。卫生所已经在农村地区建立起来。再加上群众性的爱国卫生运动，使得农村卫生条件有了很大的改进。他说，他在中国旅行期间，看到每一条街，每一列火车，都是很清洁的。他在中国旅行了五千英里之后得到的结论是：在中国，建设工作正在迅速地进行，人民的生活是稳定的，有保障的。他说，中国人民所过的生活是一种朴素而充足的生活，中国工人和农民的勤劳是令人钦佩的。
    他说，中国所面临的一个大问题，是没有足够的医务人员来满足六亿人口的需要。目前正在努力克服这个困难。他说，中国在提高人民卫生条件方面获得了巨大的成就。
    安塔拉通讯社总编辑
    刚刚访问过中华人民共和国的印度尼西亚安塔拉通讯社总编辑渣禾多在连续发表的一系列文章中评述他在新中国所见到的情况。渣禾多写道：中国人民正在有效地和迅速地进行他们的建设工作，并且获得了实在惊人的成就，这是谁也不能抹煞的。
    渣禾多在谈到中国在短期内取得巨大进展的原因时写道：“发动群众、依靠群众是他们的根本原则。依靠人民群众的力量，中国已消灭了帝国主义、封建和买办的势力。中国也是依靠人民群众的力量才铲除了贪污、浪费、官僚主义、娼妓、行贿，而这些在蒋介石的国民党政权下是很盛行的。国民党政权是因为得不到人民的支持才被摧毁了的。”
    渣禾多在他的文章里写道：从中国在过去五年中所获得的成就可以看出中国所采取的国家制度是符合于新的历史条件的。
    渣禾多在谈到中国的治安状况良好时写道，有人暗示，这种良好的社会秩序是由于压力和严格的管制造成的。但是这个国家的人民数百年来一直为反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的统治而进行了斗争，并且经历过连续不断的战争。很难想像良好的社会秩序和治安情况是由于人民害怕恫吓或压迫的结果。他说，相反地，这意味着中国人民支持目前的政府。
    渣禾多写道，中国人民并不认为他们的国家像“天堂”那样十全十美。他们处处都要求外国客人提意见。中国人民，包括他们的领袖在内，都过着简朴的生活，集中力量进行建设、搞工业化和建立社会主义社会。新的公共道德正在改变中国社会的生活方式。
    巴基斯坦妇女代表团团长
    应邀到我国参加国庆观礼的巴基斯坦妇女代表团团长沙阿·纳瓦兹夫人和部分团员在十月二十七日回到巴基斯坦。据“黎明报”报道：沙阿·纳瓦兹夫人对记者发表谈话说：她们在中国的旅行非常令人满意，她们非常感谢中国政府和人民所给予的礼遇和款待。她在谈到中国回教徒的生活时说：“在北京有八万回教徒，他们都生活得很愉快。他们在人民政府的领导下日益进步。”她说：她们参观了北京的清真寺，寺院被保存得很好。南京及其他大城市中也有许多回教居民，他们在经济上和教育上的处境都很好。
    沙阿·纳瓦兹夫人说：她们在中国参观了许多重要城市。中国人民对巴基斯坦很感兴趣，希望更多地了解这个国家。
