Pan Peixin et al. translated and published by the "Study" magazine, distributed by Xinhua Bookstore. "Opposing Dogmatism in Propaganda Work" is one of the most noteworthy issues in the Soviet Union today. The book "Opposing Dogmatism in Propaganda Work" compiles twelve editorials, treatises, essays, and communications from the Soviet "Pravda" and "Kommunist" and other magazines regarding opposing dogmatism in propaganda work. These articles criticize various manifestations of dogmatism, analyze the causes of dogmatism, point out the harm of dogmatism to the cause of Marxist-Leninist propaganda, and propose methods for overcoming dogmatism. The scope also involves the issue of opposing dogmatism in scientific research work.

In our China, the struggle against dogmatism has a long history. As early as the Anti-Japanese War period, Comrade Mao Zedong taught us in his many works that we must earnestly study Marxist-Leninist theory, that theory must be combined with the practice of the Chinese revolution, and that we must oppose all dogmatism that is not combined with practice. Therefore, in our country, dogmatism has been severely打击 (dǎjī - hit, strike). However, dogmatism is an extremely stubborn bacterium and is very difficult to eradicate completely. Therefore, in our country today, where Marxist-Leninist propaganda work and scientific research work are vigorously carried out, this book is of great significance to us.

Marxist-Leninist theory is the guide for all our activities. It gives us the ability to judge and cope with all events, and gives us the firm conviction of the victory of communism. Therefore, "the propagation of Marxist-Leninist theory is the vital cause of party organizations" (Original book, page 96).

The reason why Marxist-Leninist theory has an invincible power lies in its high degree of creativity and revolutionary nature. It is formed and developed in revolutionary practice, and it is constantly enriched and improved with new revolutionary experience. Therefore, studying and mastering Marxist-Leninist theory must not be done by rote memorization, but must be done by understanding its spirit and essence, and absorbing the positions, viewpoints, and methods it adopts in analyzing problems. Only in this way can theory constantly maintain its active vitality and play a major guiding role in practice.

However, in the Soviet Union in recent years, many theoretical articles and propaganda papers, many lectures and reports, have often been discussed using dogmatic methods. As a result, not only has the people not been correctly educated, but "people are prevented from correctly understanding what needs to be seriously and deeply scientifically researched and discussed," and "the cause of our cadres' creative understanding of the policies of the Communist Party and the Soviet government and the smooth implementation of these policies is damaged" (Original book, page 21).

The essence of dogmatism is the separation of theory from practice. In the Soviet Union, the most prominent manifestation is the excessive use of quotations. The book specifically points out that dogmatists are theoretically and politically timid, dare not independently and creatively explain problems, and are deeply afraid of being accused of underestimating or forgetting a certain classic formula. They often use lengthy quotations to replace the elaboration of Marxist-Leninist theory. Of course, criticizing the style of excessive use of quotations does not mean that quotations are not allowed. "Quotation is completely permissible, and also appropriate. The whole problem is that quotations should only be used when they are really needed" (Original book, page 5). However, dogmatists only very diligently copy down well-memorized original texts, and as a result, they blindly apply quotations that are obviously outdated in content or offer little help in explaining the essence of the problem.

There is also a situation which, although it does not appear to be excessive use of quotations on the surface, is the same in nature as simple quotation. For example, when some comrades explain the theoretical principles of Marxism-Leninism, they do not study the profound processes that occur in social life and in the development of production, economy, and culture, but simply repeat some principles and conclusions that everyone already knows and have already been discovered. The book lists many facts and sharply criticizes this phenomenon. For example, at a discussion in the classroom for propagandists directly under the Sverdlovsk City Committee of the CPSU, a propagandist talked about the content of Lenin's book "What Is to Be Done?". In his speech, everything seemed to be correct. However, the entire theoretical wealth of the original work was reduced to simply repeating well-known principles and conclusions. There are similar situations in many scientific research works. The vast majority of master's and doctoral theses in political economy and philosophy have not been published, "because there are no fresh and creative ideas in these theses. The facts cited in the theses are often copied from second-hand, or even third-hand sources, or taken from other published works. The ideas and viewpoints elaborated in them are mostly cliches" (Original book, page 69).

The phenomenon of dogmatism is particularly intolerable when it is manifested in the separation of ideological work and propaganda work from current specific tasks. The book cites many facts to illustrate that "in our ideological work, theoretical issues are often divorced from concrete reality, rarely related to the practice of communist construction, and rarely related to the tasks of a certain republic, state, border region, district, enterprise, collective farm, state farm, and machine tractor station." (Original book, page 21). Many scientific workers also limit their work to a relatively narrow scope, and rarely clarify many of the most realistic new problems in current social life. They seem not to understand that the task of all ideological work and propaganda work is to serve current tasks and serve the interests of economic and cultural construction. Therefore, the book emphasizes that "there is not and cannot be ideological work and propaganda work that is divorced from life, divorced from the concrete tasks facing the Party and the state" (Original book, page 103). That method of discussion that separates theory from the Party's policies and from the Party's practical activities to implement its policies cannot understand the creative nature of Marxist-Leninist theory.

In addition, closely related to dogmatism is the simplification and vulgarization of Marxist-Leninist theory, a phenomenon that has also been severely criticized in the book. For example, when some comrades talk about political economy, they are keen to explain the superficially similar concepts characteristic of the primitive commune's mode of production and the socialist mode of production, while forgetting to explain or making a very unimpressive explanation of the fundamental differences between these two modes of production. The book points out that this objectively amounts to idealizing the "ancient times" to some extent and vulgarizing the theory.

This dogmatic style, which is currently being criticized in the Soviet Union, is worthy of our vigilance. In our Chinese theoretical circles, whether in philosophy, history, social sciences, or natural sciences, few people seriously study current major issues based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism. Even if some people have written some articles on current economic and cultural construction, they are often keen to cite quotations, and are even no different from a compilation of quotations. Some articles that explain Marxist-Leninist theory only provide simple narration without linking it to real-world problems. For example, the book "What is Money?" (written by Shou Jinwen), published by the East China People's Publishing House, mainly explains the essence and function of money based on Marx's "Capital," while failing to make any analysis or clarification of the fundamental changes that have taken place in the essence and function of money under the socialist system and the people's democratic system. No criticism of bourgeois monetary theories is put forward at all. Such pamphlets are not only of little benefit to readers, but may even be harmful to readers' study and mastery of Marxist-Leninist theory.

As the book says, without overcoming dogmatism, "it will not be possible to teach Communists to treat theory creatively, nor will it be possible to teach our cadres to apply theory to the leadership of Party, Soviet, and economic work" (Original book, page 50). In order to strictly maintain the revolutionary and creative nature of Marxist-Leninist theory, we must resolutely struggle against this phenomenon of dogmatism.

The main root cause of dogmatism is ignorance of life and a lack of close contact with the broad masses of people. Therefore, the most effective way to overcome dogmatism is to link theory with practice.

As everyone knows, Marxist-Leninist theory has always developed on the basis of summarizing new historical experiences. Marx and Engels summarized the entire history of mankind, thereby creating the revolutionary theory of the proletariat. However, history is always developing, so theory should also constantly advance. The book points out: "To master Marxist-Leninist theory, one must first have knowledge of practical life, knowledge of the objective laws of the development of practical life, and the ability to summarize facts, analyze phenomena in vivid real life, and thereby draw correct conclusions and apply them to practical activities." (Original book, page 21).

Lenin and Stalin provided us with examples of creatively studying and mastering Marxist-Leninist theory with their own works. "Lenin firmly based himself on the principles of Marxism and its materialist dialectics, and re-examined many of the principles of Marxism, because these principles were formulated on the basis of the conditions and practice of the nineteenth century, and most of them were no longer suitable for the conditions and requirements of the revolutionary practice of the new era. Lenin enriched Marxism with new principles and new generalizations in philosophy, political economy, and scientific socialism, and answered many questions raised by life in the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution." (Original book, page 65). Stalin, in the process of socialist construction, also summarized new construction experiences, further theoretically clarified many issues, and constantly developed and enriched Marxism-Leninism.

However, dogmatists do not understand this. They shut themselves tightly in their rooms, without any contact with the outside world. Therefore, the theoretical work and propaganda work carried out by these people cannot but be stale, superficial, dry, and uninteresting.

Finally, the book also emphatically points out: linking theory with practice must never "be reduced to selecting some accidental, minor facts and examples of 'current important issues'; or to replacing theoretical analysis with discussions of narrow practical, daily affairs that are far removed from the theoretical material being studied" (Original book, page 7). Linking theory with practice requires us to deeply study practical life and understand practical life from the standpoint of Marxist-Leninist theory. Only in this way can we eliminate dogmatism in propaganda work and scientific research work, and master the essence of Marxist-Leninist theory.

    介绍“反对宣传工作中的教条主义”
    陈大可
    潘培新等译　学习杂志社出版新华书店发行反对宣传工作中和科学研究工作中的教条主义，这是苏联目前最为引人注意的问题之一。“反对宣传工作中的教条主义”一书编译了苏联“真理报”和“共产党人”及其他杂志上有关宣传工作方面反对教条主义的十二篇社论、专论、论文和通讯。这些文章批评了教条主义的各种表现，分析了产生教条主义的原因，指出了教条主义对马克思列宁主义宣传事业的危害性，并提出了克服教条主义的方法。其范围也涉及反对科学研究工作中教条主义的问题。
    在我们中国，同教条主义进行斗争是有长久的历史的。还在抗日战争时期，毛泽东同志就在他的许多著作中，教导我们必须认真学习马克思列宁主义的理论，必须使理论和中国革命的实践相结合，反对一切不和实践相结合的教条主义。因此，在我国，教条主义曾受到过严重的打击。但是，教条主义是一种极为顽固的毒菌，很不容易彻底清除。所以在我国大力开展马克思列宁主义宣传工作和科学研究工作的今天，这本书对于我们是有很大的意义的。
    马克思列宁主义的理论，是我们一切活动的指针。它给予我们对一切事件的判断和应付能力，给予我们以共产主义胜利的坚定信念。因此，“马克思列宁主义理论的宣传是党组织的切身的事业”
  （原书第九十六页）。
    马克思列宁主义的理论之所以具有不可战胜的力量，就在于它具有高度的创造性和革命性。它是在革命实践中形成和发展起来的，而且是不断以新的革命的经验来充实和提高的。因此，研究和掌握马克思列宁主义的理论，决不能死背教条，而必须理解它的精神和实质，吸取它在分析问题时所采取的立场、观点和方法。只有这样，理论才能经常保持活跃的生命力，才能对实践起重大的指导作用。
    但是，苏联近年以来，有许多理论文章和宣传论文，许多讲演和报告，往往以教条主义的方法进行论述。其结果不仅没有正确地教育人民，反而“妨碍人们正确地理解那需要认真地深刻地进行科学研究和论述的东西”，“使我们干部创造性地理解共产党和苏联政府的政策和顺利地实现这一政策的事业受到损害”（原书第二十一页）。
    教条主义的实质，就是理论和实践的脱节。在苏联最突出的表现，就是满篇引证。书中特别指出，教条主义者在理论上和政治上都很胆怯，不敢独立地创造性地说明问题，并深怕被人指责为低估了或忘记了某一个经典的公式。他们往往以连篇累牍的引证，来代替对马克思列宁主义理论的阐释。当然，批评满篇引证的作风，决不是说不允许引证。“引证完全是允许的，并且也是适当的。全部问题是在于要在真正需要的时候才援用引证”（原书第五页）。而教条主义者只非常努力地抄录背得烂熟的原文，结果就把在内容上显然陈旧或对问题实质的解释很少帮助的引文加以盲目运用。
    还有一种情况，虽然表面看来不是满篇引证，但和单纯引证在性质上也是一样的。例如，有些同志在讲解马克思列宁主义的理论原理时，不研究社会生活中以及生产、经济和文化发展中所产生的深刻过程，而只是复述一些大家早就知道的和早已被发现的原理和结论。书中列举了许多事实，尖锐地批评了这种现象。如在直属苏共斯维尔德洛夫斯克市委会的宣传员课堂讨论会上，一个宣传员讲述了列宁“做什么？”一书的内容。在他的演讲中，一切都像是很对。但是，原著的全部理论财富被归结为简单地重述人所共知的原理和结论。在很多的科学研究工作中，也有类似的情形。政治经济学和哲学方面的绝大部分硕士论文和博士论文都没有发表，
  “就是因为这些论文中没有什么新鲜的创造性的思想。论文中所引用的事实常常抄自第二手，甚至抄自第三手，或取自早经发表过的其他著作。其中所阐述的思想和观点，也多半是些老生常谈”（原书第六十九页）。
    教条主义的现象特别不能令人容忍的，是表现在把思想工作和宣传工作同当前的具体任务割裂开来。书中引证许多事实说明：“在我们的思想工作中理论问题往往脱离具体的现实，很少联系共产主义建设的实践，很少联系某一共和国、州、边疆区、区、企业、集体农庄、国营农场和机器拖拉机站的任务。”（原书第二十一页）不少科学工作者也仅仅把他们的工作局限于比较狭小的范围，而对于许多当前社会生活中最现实的新问题，却很少加以阐明。他们似乎不了解，全部思想工作和宣传工作的任务，就是为当前的任务服务，为经济和文化建设的利益服务。因此，书中很强调地指出：“没有也不能有脱离生活、脱离党和国家面临的具体任务的思想工作和宣传工作”（原书一○三页）。那种把理论同党的政策、同党为实现其政策而进行的实际活动割裂开来的论述方法，是不能理解马克思列宁主义理论的创造性质的。
    此外，和教条主义有密切关系的是把马克思列宁主义理论简单化和庸俗化，这种现象在书中也受到了严厉的批评。例如，有些同志在讲述政治经济学时，醉心于解释原始公社的生产方式和社会主义的生产方式所特有的外表上相似的概念，而对于这两种生产方式的原则性的区别，却忘记说明或者说得使人印象极不深刻。书中指出，这在客观上就是把“远古”加以某种理想化，把理论庸俗化。
    目前在苏联受到批判的这种教条主义作风，是值得我们警惕的。在我们中国的理论界，不论在哲学、历史、社会科学或自然科学等方面，很少有人认真地根据马克思列宁主义的原理来研究当前的重大问题。即使有些人就当前经济和文化建设等方面写过一些文章，也往往醉心于引证，甚至无异于引文的汇编。有些讲述马克思列宁主义理论的文章，只有简单地进行叙述，而不把它同现实问题联系起来。例如，华东人民出版社出版的“什么是货币”
  （寿进文著）一书，主要只是根据马克思的“资本论”来说明货币的本质和职能，而对于货币的本质和职能在社会主义制度和人民民主制度下所发生的根本的变化，则没有作任何分析和阐明。对于资产阶级的货币学说，也根本没有提出批判。这样的小册子不仅给读者益处不大，甚至还有害于读者对马克思列宁主义理论的研究和掌握。
    正如书中所说，不克服教条主义，“就不能教会共产党员创造性地对待理论，就不能教会我们的干部把理论运用到党的、苏维埃的和经济的领导工作中去”（原书第五十页）。为了严格保持马克思列宁主义理论的革命性和创造性，必须同这种教条主义的现象进行坚决的斗争。
    教条主义的主要根源就是对生活的无知，以及同广大人民群众缺乏密切的联系。因此，克服教条主义的最有效的办法就是理论联系实践。
    大家知道，马克思列宁主义的理论始终是在概括新的历史经验的基础上发展的。马克思、恩格斯概括了人类的全部历史，从而创立了无产阶级的革命理论。但是，历史永远是在发展着的，所以理论也应不断地前进。书中指出：“掌握马克思列宁主义的理论，一定预先要有实际生活的知识，要有实际生活发展的客观法则的知识，要有概括事实、分析生动的现实生活中的现象、并由此做出正确的结论而将其运用到实际活动中去的本领。”（原书第二十一页）
    列宁和斯大林曾以他们自己的著作，给我们提供了创造性地研究和掌握马克思列宁主义理论的范例。“列宁牢固地依据马克思主义的原则及其唯物辩证法，重新考察了马克思主义的许多原理，因为这些原理是在十九世纪的条件和实践的基础上制定的，其中大部分已不适合于新时代革命实践的条件和要求了。列宁以哲学、政治经济学和科学社会主义方面的新的原理、新的概括丰富了马克思主义，回答了在帝国主义和无产阶级革命时代的生活所提出的许多问题。”（原书第六十五页）斯大林在社会主义建设的进程中又概括了新的建设经验，进一步地从理论上阐明了许多问题，不断地发展并丰富了马克思列宁主义。
    但是，教条主义者不了解这一点，他们将自己紧紧地关闭在房间里，同外界的一切没有联系。因此，这些人所进行的理论工作和宣传工作，就不能不是陈腐肤浅、干燥无味的了。
    最后，书中还着重地指出：理论联系实践，决不能“归结为挑选一些偶然的、次要的事实和‘当前重要问题上的’例证；或者，归结为用狭隘实际的、与所研究的理论材料关系很远的日常事务的讨论来代替理论的分析。”（原书第七页）理论联系实践，要求我们必须深刻地研究实际生活，并从马克思列宁主义理论的立场来理解实际生活。只有这样，才能消除宣传工作中和科学研究工作中的教条主义，才能掌握马克思列宁主义理论的实质。
