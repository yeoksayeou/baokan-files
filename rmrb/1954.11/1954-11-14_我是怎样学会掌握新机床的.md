How I Learned to Master the New Machine Tool
Yu Dexiu, Precision Boring Machine Worker, Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory

    I was originally an ordinary young milling machine operator at Harbin Tool Factory. This spring, I was transferred to the tool workshop of Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory. On my first day in the workshop, the workshop director assigned me to study the precision boring machine. He told me that this machine tool was very important, as many of the jigs and fixtures required it to complete the most precise process. Without it, the most precise jigs and fixtures could not be manufactured. I was very excited, and with enthusiasm and courage, I assured the director that I would complete this task in a very short time.

    The director was very pleased with my answer, patted me on the shoulder and said, "Very good, then I will take you there."

    He led me to a bright little room. As soon as I entered the room, I saw a tall fellow. It could drill all kinds of holes, bore all kinds of planes, and could be accurate to seventy times thinner than a human hair. I looked closely and there were some things I couldn't even understand. There were six or seven kinds of main scales and vernier scales. When starting it, you just had to press a button next to it. And there was a strange thing on top called an "optical coordinate measuring instrument." You just had to look inside and align two lines. Even if there was a difference as thin as seventy times thinner than a human hair (one-thousandth of a centimeter), it could see it clearly.

    I heard that in the Soviet Union, only standard workers could master this machine. I thought that it would be very difficult for someone with my low technical level to learn, and I really wasn't sure.

    There was a Soviet expert in our workshop, Comrade Dugin. He came to work every day when the workers came to work, and he was always walking around the workshop. When he saw me, he asked:
      "Are you here to learn how to operate it?"
    I said, "Yes." The expert was very happy that another young person had come to learn and master the new technology. He asked me to pay attention to the cleanliness of the room and to protect the machine well.

    Every day when the expert came to the small room, he would always ask about my learning progress and tell me about the general performance and operation methods of the machine tool. Gradually, I started to practice operating the machine tool.

    Operating a precise, modern machine tool requires less physical strength, but you have to use your brain. For example, to calculate the scale, you must not only understand arithmetic, but also trigonometry. The expert knew our difficulties and was very patient and specific in helping us learn. He often explained three or four times until we thoroughly understood it. Once, I was practicing making a drill sleeve for a plate press. I thought about it again and again, but I didn't know how to calculate the distance. When the expert saw that I was having difficulties, he told me the specific methods and principles in detail. The expert asked me, as before, "Can you explain it?"

    I calculated it correctly, but the reasoning wasn't clear enough. The expert started from the requirements of the drawings, the interrelationships of the parts, and the direction of operation, until I understood why it should be calculated this way, not just memorizing the methods but mastering the basic principles. He was satisfied only after he had explained it completely clearly.
      The most difficult part of operating this semi-automatic machine tool is adjusting the work. Starting the machine is simple; you just have to press a button. But the most troublesome part of the adjustment is clamping the work. The quality of the workpiece largely depends on the clamping. Therefore, you must carefully consider the requirements of the drawings and the processing procedure to determine the most appropriate position for the workpiece. The workpieces for precision boring machines are irregular, so the clamping work is even more difficult to get started. The expert was also most concerned about this and would come every day to ask what problems I was having. Once, he saw me making a hexagonal hole drill and couldn't find the center point, and I was sweating profusely. So he ran over and asked me, "Can you clamp this work?"
    I replied, "I'm thinking about it, but I don't know why I can't clamp it."

    The expert explained the methods and principles for a long time, but I still didn't understand it very well. He immediately took off his shirt and threw it on the table and started doing it himself. He worked from 8:00 AM to 11:00 AM. It was a hot day, and although the temperature in the room wasn't very high, the expert's shirt was immediately soaked with sweat because the ventilation equipment hadn't been installed yet. It was too hot, so he went to the door to get some air, and then immediately went back to work. I listened carefully when the expert was explaining; I watched carefully when the expert was working. After the expert finished, he explained it again, and asked me to explain it again, until I really understood it before he left.

    This was not an isolated incident. Once, he didn't even eat lunch. The workers finished eating and went back to work, but they still saw him continuing to work, and he didn't leave until he had finished the job.

    Since we had basically mastered the machine tool, the expert gave us more guidance and didn't use the method of doing it himself or directly pointing it out. Once, I was making a vibration inspection tool. This thing was very long, and if I wanted to drill a hole in the middle, I had to drill half of it from one end, and then switch to the other end to drill, but I had to make sure that the center points of the holes drilled from both ends were on the same line. I felt very difficult. When the expert saw that I was worried, he drew a picture for me and drew all the principles on the picture. When I saw the picture, I felt like I suddenly understood, and after thinking about it, I really had a way to do it. The expert saw that I had an epiphany and smiled and said, "Okay, then you do it." Not long after, he saw that I was doing it completely according to the requirements, and he happily went back to rest.

    As long as we made a little progress, the expert would say "Very good" to encourage us to learn. However, the expert's requirements for us were very strict, and he was not sloppy even in cleaning work. One Saturday afternoon, we spent an hour wiping the machines in the small room, and the outside of the machines were shiny. The foreman thought it was "good", and we were naturally even more satisfied, just waiting for the expert to come and inspect, thinking that the expert would be very happy. However, the expert touched the top of the bed - his hand was black, opened the motor cover and touched it - and his hand was black again. The expert said unhappily, "Look at your clean white shirts, but you take care of the machines less than you take care of your white shirts!" He asked us to scrub them again, and we had to clean the inside of the machines.

    Since then, we have always done a good job in cleaning. Not to mention the machine tools, even the tools are wiped brightly and neatly arranged. Not for a minute can you see a mess, and the floor is often wiped cleaner than a dance floor.

    The serious spirit of the Soviet experts deeply moved us and urged us to accelerate our learning and master new technologies. We know that to master new technologies, we still need to study hard on our own. Every night, when the people in the workshop had all gone back, I was alone under the lamp, quietly studying the drawings. I took every opportunity to learn from the veteran workers; at the same time, I also learned from comrades in other workshops. In this way, in a month and a half, I basically mastered the operation of the machine tool. Now, every morning when I come to the workshop, I first take out the drawings, find the tools, then carry out the adjustment work, and then press a button, and the machine tool starts according to its rhythm, and the work of the day begins. My mood is always very happy, and batches of tool fixtures go out from this machine tool. In completing the workshop's plan, the precision boring machine has fulfilled its responsibility.

    However, strictly speaking, my technical level is still far behind. I am determined to redouble my efforts to continuously improve my technology and dedicate all my strength to building the motherland.

    我是怎样学会掌握新机床的
    哈尔滨量具刃具厂精密镗床工人  于德修
    我原是哈尔滨工具厂的一个普通青年铣工，今年春天，才被调到哈尔滨量具刃具厂工具车间来。到车间的第一天，车间主任就分配我到精密镗床上去学习。他跟我说，这台机床是很重要的，很多的工卡具都要由它来完成最精密的一道工序，没有它，最精密的工卡具就无法制造。我非常兴奋，凭着热情和勇气向主任保证：我将在很短的时间内完成这个任务。
    主任很满意我的回答，拍拍我的肩膀说：“很好，那末我就领你去吧。”
    他领我到一间明亮的小房间里去。一进小屋我就看到一个高大的家伙，它可以钻各种孔，可以镗各色各样的平面，而且可以精确到七十分之一根头发粗的厚薄。我再细细的一瞅有些东西连看也看不懂，主标尺、副标尺就有六七种，开动的时候在旁边一按电钮就行。那上边还有个怪家伙叫“光学坐表仪”，往里看到有两条线对准了就行。即使有像七十分之一根头发粗（千分之一糎）的差异它也能看得清清楚楚。
    听说，在苏联，也要标准工人才能掌握这台机器。我想，像我这样技术水平不高的人，学起来一定是够费劲的，心里真是没有把握。
    我们车间里有个苏联专家——杜金同志，每天工人上班他就上班，整天在车间里转着。他见了我就问：
      “你是到这里来学习操作的吗？”
    我说“是的”。专家很高兴又多了一个年青人来学习掌握新技术。他要求我注意室内清洁，好好的保护机器。
    每天专家来到小屋的时候，他总要问问我的学习情况，并且跟我讲述机床一般性能和操作方法。渐渐的，我就开始上机床练习操作了。
    操纵精密的现代化机床，虽然费体力少，但要
  动脑筋。例如，要计算标尺，不仅要懂得算术，而
  且还要懂得三角。专家知道我们的困难，在帮助我们学习时非常耐心和具体。他经常一连讲三四遍，
  直到我们彻底明白才停止。有一次，我练习做板压钻套，想来想去，都不知道怎样算距离。专家看我
  有困难，就把具体的办法和道理都详细的告诉我。
  专家像过去一样，讲完以后就问我“能说得上吗？”
  我算是算对了，但道理讲的不够清楚。专家就从图
  纸要求、各部分相互关系、开动方向等方面说起，
  直到我明白为什么应该这样计算，不是死记住办法
  而是掌握住基本的道理，讲得完全清楚后他才满
  意。
      操作这种半自动的机床最困难的地方是调整工
  作，至于开动机器很简单，只要一按电钮就行了。
  而在调整工作中最伤脑筋的是卡活，加工物的好坏
  大部是由卡活来决定的。因此，在卡活前要有周密
  的考虑，根据图纸的要求和加工程序，确定加工物
  的最妥当位置。精密镗床的加工物都是不规则的，
  所以卡活工作更难下手，专家也最关心它，每天都
  要来问问有些什么问题。有一次，他看见我在做六
  角形孔钻具时，找不到中心点，急得满头大汗，于是跑来问我：“这活你会卡吗？”
    我回答：“我正在考虑，可不知怎的总卡不上。”
    专家讲了很久方法和道理，但我还是不很明白，他马上就把上衣脱下往桌上一撩，亲自干起来了。他从上午八点一直干到十一点多。这时正是热天，屋内温度虽不很高，但由于通风设备还未安装，专家的衬衣一下子就被汗水湿透了。实在太热了，他才到门口去透一透风，回头就又马上干起来。专家讲的时候，我仔细听着；专家干时我用心看着。专家干完后又讲一遍，并且要我重讲一遍，直到我真的明白以后才走。
    这样的事情并不是偶然的一回，曾经有一次他连饭也不吃，工人吃完了饭上班了，还见他在继续的干着，直到把那个活干完才走。
    我们对机床基本上已能掌握了，专家就多启发我们，而不大采用亲自干或直接指点的方法了。有一次，我做振动检查工具，这东西很长，要在中间钻孔，就必须一头钻一半，又换一头钻，但必须使两头钻孔的中心点要在一条线上。我感到很困难。专家看到我正在发愁，就跟我画了个图，把道理都画在图上。我一看图心里好像忽然开窍了，再考虑一下，确实就有了办法。专家看到我恍然大悟的样子就笑了笑说：“好，那你就干吧。”不多久他看见我干得完全合乎要求，才高兴地回去休息。
    只要我们有一点进步，专家就说“很好”，鼓励我们学习。但是，专家对我们的要求非常严格，即使是清洁工作，也丝毫不马虎。有一个星期六的下午，我们花了一个钟头在小屋里擦洗机器，把机器外表擦的亮堂堂的，工长认为“不错”，我们自然是更加满意，光坐等专家来检查了，满以为专家很高兴的。可是，专家到床顶上一摸——一手黑，打开马达盖子一摸——又是一手黑。专家很不高兴地说：“看看你们穿的白衬衣倒挺干净，可是你们爱护机器还不如看护你们的白衬衣！”他要求我们重新擦洗，必须把机器的内部擦洗干净。
    从此以后，我们的清洁工作一直做得很好。机床自不必说，就是工具也都擦得明明亮亮，排得有条有理，没有一分钟可以看到乱七八糟的，地板更是经常擦得比跳舞用的地板还干净。
    苏联专家的认真的精神，深深地感动了我们，督促我们加紧学习掌握新技术。我们知道，要掌握好新技术，还有赖于自己的苦学。每天晚间车间里的人都回去了，我一个人在灯下静静的钻研图纸。我利用一切机会向老师傅们学习；同时还向其它车间的同志学习。这样，在一个半月的时间里，我基本上掌握了机床的操作。现在，我每天早晨来到车间，首先拿出图纸，找好工具，再进行调整工作，然后一按电钮，机床就按着它的韵律开动了，一天的工作开始了。我的心情始终是十分愉快的，成批的工具卡具从这个机床上出去，在完成车间的计划上，精密镗床尽到了它的责任。
    但是，严格讲起来，我的技术水平还差得很远。我有决心加倍努力，把技术不断提高，为建设祖国而献出全部力量。
