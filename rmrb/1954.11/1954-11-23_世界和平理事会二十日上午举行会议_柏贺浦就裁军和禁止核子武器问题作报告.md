Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm, November 22nd: The World Peace Council held a meeting on the morning of the 20th, at which London University nuclear physics professor Powell gave a report on the actions that peace forces should take to achieve disarmament and prohibit weapons of mass destruction.

Professor Powell pointed out in his report that the issue of disarmament and the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction has always been the focus of the worldwide peace movement. He then talked about the threat posed by the atomic arms race, and the large-scale signature campaigns against weapons of mass destruction by the people of Japan and the United Kingdom. Powell said that the threat of the use of new weapons of mass destruction has aroused the anger of the public in all countries of the world, which is only natural, because the main characteristic of this threat is that it is a global threat. Therefore, the world peace movement has a great task before it. No agreement has yet been reached to prohibit these weapons of mass destruction.

Powell further pointed out the serious impact of arming West Germany on all issues related to disarmament. He said: Disarmament and the prohibition of nuclear weapons are mutually exclusive with the arming of Germany. The movement against the arming of West Germany and the movement for universal disarmament and the prohibition of nuclear weapons are actually two aspects of the same movement. If an agreement is reached on disarmament and the prohibition of nuclear weapons, the issue of rearming West Germany will become completely irrelevant. That is why urgent steps must be taken to reach an agreement.

Powell emphasized that reaching such an agreement is possible. He pointed out that the five-nation proposal of the United Nations General Assembly on the issue of disarmament and the prohibition of nuclear weapons was adopted after certain concessions were made by Western countries and the Soviet Union. If this spirit of coordination can be implemented in further negotiations, it is possible to reach an agreement.

Powell then pointed out that the reason that has hindered reaching an agreement in the past eight years is the irreconcilable attitude of the United States.

Powell said that we must redouble our efforts to carry out our campaign for disarmament and the prohibition of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. He also talked about the great importance of the peaceful application of atomic energy. He said that the issue of disarmament and the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes is a political issue. These issues cannot be solved in isolation from other issues. As long as the government of the People's Republic of China, which represents a quarter of the world's population, is still deprived of the right to participate in disarmament discussions, it is impossible to effectively discuss the issue of disarmament.

Those who spoke in the discussion of Professor Powell's report included: Professor Bonsdorff (Finland), Gustave Gaudart (France), Antoine Allard (Belgium), Alexander Korneichuk (Soviet Union), Mrs. Molly Mendell (UK), representative of the Women's International Democratic Federation, A. Bouchama (Algeria), and Castro, Chairman of the Council of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.

    世界和平理事会二十日上午举行会议
    柏贺浦就裁军和禁止核子武器问题作报告
    【新华社二十二日讯】据塔斯社斯德哥尔摩讯：世界和平理事会会议二十日上午举行会议，伦敦大学核子物理学教授柏贺浦作了关于和平力量为实现裁减军备和禁止大规模毁灭性武器而应采取的行动的报告。
    柏贺浦教授在报告中指出，裁减军备和禁止大规模毁灭性武器问题一直是世界范围的和平运动的注意中心。他接着谈到原子军备竞赛所造成的威胁，以及日本和英国人民的规模巨大的反对大规模毁灭性武器的签名运动。柏贺浦说，使用新式大规模毁灭性武器的威胁，引起了世界一切国家公众的愤怒，这是很自然的，因为这种威胁的主要特点就是：它是世界性的威胁。因此，世界和平运动面前有着伟大的任务。现在还没有达成禁止这些大规模毁灭性武器的协议。
    柏贺浦进一步指出武装西德对有关裁减军备的一切问题所产生的严重影响。他说：裁减军备和禁止核子武器同武装德国是互相排斥的。反对武装西德的运动和争取普遍裁军和禁止核子武器的运动，实际上是一个运动的两个方面。如果在裁军和禁止核子武器方面达成了协议，重新武装西德的问题就会变得完全没有实际意义了。这就是为什么必须采取紧急步骤来达成协议的原因。
    柏贺浦强调指出达成这种协议是可能的。他指出，联合国大会关于裁军和禁止核子武器问题的五国提案是在西方国家和苏联作了某些让步之后通过的，如果在进一步的谈判的过程中能够贯彻这种协调精神，达成协议是可能的。
    柏贺浦接着指出，过去八年中妨碍取得协议的原因就是美国的不调和的态度。
    柏贺浦说，我们必须加倍努力来进行我们的裁军和禁止核子武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器的运动。他也谈到了和平应用原子能的巨大重要性。他说，裁减军备和把原子能用于和平用途的问题是政治问题。不能把这些问题同其他问题孤立开来加以解决。只要代表着全世界人口四分之一的中华人民共和国政府还被剥夺参加裁军讨论的权利，切实地讨论裁减军备问题就是不可能的。
    在讨论柏贺浦教授的报告时发言的有：邦斯多夫教授（芬兰），居斯塔夫·葛戴勒（法国），安多瓦纳·阿拉（比利时），亚历山大·考涅楚克（苏联），国际民主妇联代表莫利·孟戴尔夫人（英国），阿·布夏马（阿尔及利亚）和联合国粮食及农业组织理事会主席卡斯特罗。
