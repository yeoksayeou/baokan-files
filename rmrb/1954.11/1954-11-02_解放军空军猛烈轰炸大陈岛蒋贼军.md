Xinhua News Agency, Zhejiang Front, 1st. The People's Liberation Army Air Force units on the Zhejiang Front fiercely bombed the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops entrenched on Upper and Lower Dachen Islands at around 11:00 AM this morning. Our People's Air Force dropped a large number of bombs, severely destroying many military targets. A Chiang Kai-shek bandit warship anchored on the sea surface of Dachen Island was hit and burst into flames. Many military targets in Da'aoli and other places on Upper and Lower Dachen Islands were bombed into a sea of ​​fire.

Braving the dense fire of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops' anti-aircraft artillery, our People's Air Force formation accurately bombed the military targets on Upper and Lower Dachen Islands and then returned safely.

Upper and Lower Dachen Islands are located in the southeast sea of ​​Zhejiang, more than 40 li from the mainland. After the mainland was liberated, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops entrenched themselves on Upper and Lower Dachen Islands. Under the instigation and protection of the American aggressor group, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique used this island as an important stronghold for plundering and robbing fishing boats and merchant ships at sea, and harassing the coastal areas of the mainland, threatening and destroying maritime transportation and the safety of coastal people. There are more than 10,000 Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops, including the army, and more than a dozen warships on Upper and Lower Dachen Islands and nearby sea areas. The "Western Enterprise Company, Dachen Branch," an American spy agency stationed on the island, specializes in training US-Chiang Kai-shek special agents and sending them to sneak into the mainland to carry out sabotage and assassination activities.

    解放军空军猛烈轰炸大陈岛蒋贼军
    【新华社浙江前线一日电】浙江前线中国人民解放军空军部队某部在一日上午十一时许猛烈轰炸盘踞上、下大陈岛的蒋贼军。我人民空军投下大批炸弹，严重地摧毁了许多军事目标。停泊在大陈岛海面上的一艘蒋贼军舰被炸中燃起烈火。在上、下大陈岛上大岙里等地的许多军事目标，都被炸成一片火海。
    我人民空军机群冒着蒋贼军高射炮的密集炮火，准确地轰炸了上、下大陈岛上的军事目标后，全部安全返航。
    上、下大陈岛位于浙江东南海面，距大陆约四十多华里。大陆解放后，蒋贼军即盘踞上、下大陈岛。在美国侵略集团的指使和庇护下，蒋介石卖国集团把这个岛作为抢掠和劫夺海上的渔船、商船和骚扰大陆沿海地区的重要据点之一，威胁和破坏海上航运和沿海人民的安全。上、下大陈岛和附近海面，有蒋贼军陆军约一万多人，舰艇十多艘。设在岛上的美国特务机关“西方企业公司大陈分公司”专门训练美蒋特务人员，并派遣他们潜入大陆进行破坏和暗害活动。
