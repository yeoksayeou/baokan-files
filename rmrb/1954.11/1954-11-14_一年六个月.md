    One Year and Six Months
    Yang Tingxiu, Lu Zhongxiang
    The Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tools Factory has fully entered the production mastery stage. This factory officially started construction in May of last year, and only one year and six months have passed since then.
    In this year and six months, the working class has proven through creative actions that they are not afraid of any difficulties in order to complete the construction plan ahead of schedule. Many employees participated in the labor emulation drive that started in August of last year.
    In winter, Harbin is covered in thick snow, and the mercury in the thermometer often drops below minus twenty degrees Celsius. Every day before dawn, workers rush from afar to the construction site and use their hands to lay bricks one by one under the moonlight. It was originally possible to suspend work at minus twenty-five degrees Celsius, but on Lunar New Year's Eve, even though it was as cold as minus twenty-eight degrees Celsius, the workers persisted until eight o'clock in the evening in order to avoid abandoning the half-poured concrete floor slab—they only stopped working after the pouring was completed. When the wind was strong and the rain was heavy, some workers insisted on using up the grout on the roof frame to avoid wasting cement before coming down. Xue Jiantang, an old carpenter with thirty-nine years of experience, moved his bedding into the workshop when the engineering tasks were tight, so that he could produce during the day and study and improve machinery and equipment at night. He worked hard to improve the machine for making floors, which could increase efficiency tenfold and enable the machine to perform a variety of tasks instead of just one. The group he belonged to was named an advanced production group in Harbin last year. In completing the tasks for 1954, under his leadership, the carpentry workshop completed the task that was planned to take 16,000 work hours with only 3,000 work hours. Yu Shide, a concrete mixer worker, improved the equipment, increasing efficiency more than four times and ensuring a timely and sufficient supply of concrete to the construction site. In the increased production and conservation campaign competition in 1953, 160 groups received fixed red flags for implementing creative labor. In this competition, 8.5 billion yuan was directly saved for the country. This year, another 3.6 billion yuan has been saved.
    We also saw the enthusiasm of the people across the country for building our motherland's industry. Last July, the Songhua River rose sharply, and transportation was blocked. A large batch of river stones we purchased from the Suihua Local State-Owned Qinquan Gravel Plant had to be transported by train. However, the transportation from the gravel plant to the railway station was by horse-drawn carriage. At that time, there were only four or five carriages, and the roads were muddy and difficult to navigate, and the situation was very urgent. The Suihua County Committee of the Communist Party of China immediately convened a special meeting and mobilized the county, district, and township's huge transportation capacity to ensure that the river stones were transported to the factory in a timely manner. When our factory's boiler room urgently needed special-shaped refractory bricks, the Tangshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Tangshan Finance Committee immediately arranged for the Dongya Kiln Factory to stop other secondary work and specialize in producing refractory bricks for the Measuring & Cutting Tools Factory. For example, the heating network needed seamless steel pipes. At that time, there was no domestic production of seamless steel pipes, and it was too late to order them from abroad, but with the support of the Ministry of Textile Industry and other units, this difficulty was resolved in seven days.
    We also saw the internationalist assistance provided by the Soviet Union. This assistance enabled us to smoothly overcome the difficulties of insufficient experience and backward technology. Soon after the official start of construction, Soviet experts Ivakin and Dadarinzev came to the construction site from the Soviet Union to provide specific guidance. They helped design a series of mechanical processing plants and workshops for concrete, carpentry, and riveting and welding, ensuring the supply of prefabricated parts accounting for more than 50% of the total construction investment. They reorganized the construction organization design in a rational way, promoted the use of factory-based and mechanized construction methods, greatly accelerated the speed of construction, and created favorable conditions for exceeding the task every month after August. As the progress of the project accelerated, the experts suggested that the final three projects originally planned for 1954—the measuring tool workshop, the central water tower, and the factory building—be implemented in winter construction in November 1953. In winter construction, Soviet experts introduced and helped promote a series of advanced Soviet experiences such as "frozen bricklaying method" and "concrete steam heating method," so that the quality of winter construction was even better than that of summer construction. Soviet experts attached great importance to the testing of materials (including bricks, tiles, sand, steel, cement) and the timely identification of finished and semi-finished products during construction. They suggested establishing a laboratory. They said, "The laboratory is the eye of construction." As a matter of fact, many quality problems were prevented in advance by implementing testing and identification of raw materials and semi-finished products.
    Due to the resolute implementation of the Soviet experts' suggestions, the progress of factory construction was faster. According to the design plan, it could only be completed in the first quarter of next year, but the employees completed the factory construction task half a year ahead of schedule on the premise of ensuring quality.
    The specific assistance of Soviet experts also enabled the factory to make certain achievements in saving. The implementation of highly factory-based and mechanized construction methods meant that equipment, materials, and manpower were used collectively, which saved more than the past handicraft-style construction. For example, in the past, the loss rate of raw wood processing was generally around 40%, while the loss rate of the carpentry workshop of the Measuring & Cutting Tools Factory in processing doors, windows, and floors was an average of about 15%. Because the quality was guaranteed, the serious waste caused by rework accidents was greatly reduced.
    In the one year and six months, the employees participating in the construction gradually grew up under the care of the Party and the help of Soviet experts as the project developed. Before participating in the construction of the Measuring & Cutting Tools Factory, only a small number of workers had participated in the construction of the Harbin Linen Factory. The vast majority of workers were farmers who had just come from the countryside and urban poor who had never even experienced general construction. At the beginning of the construction, there were no special technical workers such as crane workers, concrete mixing workers, and tank crane workers required for mechanized construction. The construction site only had three assistant engineers, eight technical management cadres at the site director level, and thirty-eight technicians.
    Under the specific guidance of Soviet experts, the employees learned while building. Some of them participated in various training courses organized by the factory. Now, among the more than 3,700 workers participating in the factory construction, more than 300 people are proficient in advanced factory-based and mechanized technology, more than 500 people have learned advanced methods of winter construction, and there are more than 100 special technicians. A total of 123 foremen and construction workers have been trained from the workers. The skills of ordinary workers have been significantly improved. For example, bricklayers used to lay an average of 1,200 bricks per person per day, but now they lay an average of 1,800 bricks; a carpentry team used to produce an average of three or four windows per day, but now they can produce 20 windows.
    In learning, many outstanding people have emerged. Wang Chunjiang, the chief foreman of the ventilation workers, has now been praised by Soviet experts as "the future Chinese ventilation expert." The Measuring & Cutting Tools Factory includes six major ventilation and air conditioning systems, which are responsible for exhausting heat, smoke, dust, sending humid hot air in winter, and sending humid cold air in summer. Wang Chunjiang used to be a tinsmith who couldn't understand blueprints or calculate. But he studied with experts and technicians at work and bought a lecture note on ventilation and studied hard in the evening. Through unremitting efforts, he now masters the ventilation performance in theory and has learned to calculate the amount of air. He also designed the ventilation project for the technical school and the fire station. The more than 10,000 meters of ventilation projects he led have all met quality standards, and the experts were very satisfied after the appraisal. Li Linsheng, a crane operator, was originally a farmer from Hebei Province who had never seen a machine before. Within a few months of arriving at the factory, he not only skillfully operated the crane on the construction site, but also worked hard to create a new hoisting method that enabled the machine weighing tens of thousands of pounds to fall lightly on the foundation. The machines installed in the factory are very precise, and as long as they are vibrated or overturned, the precision will be seriously affected. Li Linsheng and his team of workers used the new hoisting method to prevent more than 100 precise machines from being vibrated. Xie Ming, the leader of the machine installation team, was a transferred cadre who didn't even know what a "foundation bolt" was when he first arrived at the construction site. But he often followed the technicians to the site to learn and asked the engineers to give him lectures, so he gradually became familiar with the business. The installation team he led completed the installation task five months ahead of schedule and accumulated a set of experiences, and the installation quality was also praised by Soviet experts.

    一年六个月
    杨亭秀　陆忠祥
    哈尔滨量具刃具厂全部进入掌握生产阶段了。这个工厂在去年五月正式开始施工，到现在不过一年六个月的时间。
    在这一年六个月里，工人阶级以创造性的行动来证明：为了提前完成建设计划，是不怕任何困难的。许多职工都参加了从去年八月份就开始的劳动竞赛。
    在冬天，哈尔滨到处是厚厚的积雪，寒暑表的水银柱经常降到零下二十度以下。每天天还没亮，工人便从远处赶到工地，在月光下用双手把砖头一块一块地砌上去。本来在零下二十五度就可以暂停工作的，但在旧历除夕那天，虽然冷到零下二十八度了，工人们为了不使浇灌一半的混凝土楼板中途而废，仍然坚持到晚上八点钟——浇灌完了才停止工作。在刮大风、下大雨的时候，有的工人为了不使水泥浪费，坚持在屋架上把灰浆用完后才下来。有三十九年工龄的老木工薛建堂，在工程任务紧张时，把铺盖搬进了车间，以便白天生产晚上研究改进机器设备。他苦心钻研，改进了制作地板的机器，可以提高效率十倍，并使机器由只干一种活变为能干多种多样的活。他所在的那个小组，去年被评为哈尔滨市的先进生产小组。在完成一九五四年的任务中，木工车间在他的带动下更以三千工时完成了计划要一万六千个工时才能完成的任务。混凝土搅拌工人于世德改进了设备，提高效率四倍多，保证了工地混凝土及时的充足的供应。在一九五三年的增产节约运动竞赛中，有一百六十个小组因为实行了创造性的劳动而得到固定红旗。在这个竞赛中，直接为国家节约八十五亿元。今年又节约了三十六亿元。
    我们也看到全国人民对建设祖国工业的热忱。去年七月松花江江水骤涨，交通受阻，我们在绥化地方国营秦泉砂石厂购买的大批河流石必须由火车运输。但从砂石厂到火车站之间，是用马车运输的，当时只有四五辆车，道路又泥泞难行，情况十分紧急。中共绥化县委会立即召开专门会议，动员了县、区、乡庞大的运输力量，保证了河流石及时运送到厂。我们工厂锅炉房急需异型耐火砖时，中共唐山市委和唐山财委立即布置东亚窑业厂停止了其它次要的工作，专为量具刃具厂生产耐火砖。又如热力网需要无缝钢管，当时国内还没有生产无缝钢管，国外订货又来不及，但在中央纺织工业部等单位的支援下，在七天内就解决了这一困难。
    我们也看见了苏联给予的国际主义的援助，这个援助，使我们能顺利地克服经验不足，技术落后的困难。在正式开工不久，苏联专家依瓦基和达达林则夫同志就从苏联来到工地进行具体指导。他们帮助设计了混凝土、木工、铆焊等一系列的机械加工场和加工车间，保证了占建筑总投资额百分之五十以上预制件的供应。他们重新合理安排了施工组织设计，推动采用工厂化机械化施工方法，大大加速了施工的速度，为八月份以后月月超额完成任务创造了有利的条件。工程进度加速了，专家就建议把原计划在一九五四年进行的最后的三个项目——量具厂房、中央水塔、厂部大楼，提前在一九五三年十一月份实行冬季施工。在冬季施工中苏联专家介绍和帮助推广了“冻结砌砖法”、“混凝土蒸气加热法”等一系列的苏联先进经验，使冬季施工的质量比夏季施工的质量还好。苏联专家十分重视对材料（包括砖、瓦、砂石、钢材、水泥）的化验，和施工中对成品和半成品进行及时的鉴定。他们建议成立化验室。他们说“化验室是建筑的眼睛”。事实也是这样，许多质量问题都因对原材料和半成品实行化验和鉴定而预先防止了。
    由于坚决地贯彻了苏联专家的建议，使建厂的进度更快。按设计的计划，到明年第一季度才能建成的，但职工们在保证质量的前提下提前半年完成了建厂任务。
    苏联专家的具体帮助使工厂在节约方面也做出了一定的成绩。实行了高度的工厂化、机械化的施工方法，设备、材料、人力因集体使用而较过去手工业式的施工要节省得多。例如，过去元木加工的损耗率，一般在百分之四十左右，而量具刃具厂的木工车间在加工门窗地板时损耗率平均为百分之十五左右，由于质量得到保证，因返工事故而造成的严重浪费就大大减少。
    在一年六个月的时间里，参加建设的职工在党的关怀和苏联专家的帮助下，随着工程的发展而逐渐成长了起来。在参加量具刃具厂的建设之前，只有一部分工人参加过哈尔滨亚麻厂的建设工作，绝大部分工人都是才从农村来的农民和城市贫民，连一般的建筑也没经历过。在开始施工的时候，机械化施工所需的起重工人、混凝土搅拌工人、坦克吊车工人等特种技术工人一个也没有。工地只有三个助理工程师，八个工地主任级技术管理干部，三十八个技术员。
    在苏联专家具体指导下，职工们一面建设一面学习，有一部分参加了工厂举办的各种训练班。现在，在参加建厂的三千七百多名工人中，有三百多人熟练地掌握了工厂化机械化的先进技术，有五百多人学会了冬季施工的先进方法，特种技工也有了一百多人。从工人中培养出的工长和施工员共一百二十三名。一般工人的技术已有显著提高，如瓦工，以前每人每天平均砌砖一千二百块，现在平均砌一千八百块；以前一个木工组每天平均生产三、四扇窗，现在能生产二十扇窗。
    在学习中，出现了许多出色的人物。通风工的总工长王春江现在已被苏联专家誉为“未来的中国通风专家”。量具刃具厂包括六大通风和空气调节系统，它要担负排热、排烟、排灰尘、冬天送湿性热风、夏天送湿性冷风的任务。王春江过去是个白铁工，看不懂图纸，也不会计算。但他在工作中跟专家和技术人员学习，买了一本关于通风的讲义在晚间苦心钻研。由于坚持不懈的努力，他现在在理论上掌握了通风性能，并学会计算风量大小。他还设计了技工学校和消防所的通风工程。他领导施工的一万多公尺的通风工程都达到质量标准，专家鉴定后非常满意。起重工李林生，原是河北省的一个农民，从来没有见过机器。到厂没有几个月的时间，不仅在工地上熟练地开动起重机，而且苦心钻研，创造了一个新的起重方法，使起重的上万斤重的机器能够轻轻地落在基础上。该厂安装的机器都非常精密，只要受一点震动或起倒了，精密度就会受到严重的影响。李林生和他的小组工人，运用了新的起重方法，使一百几十台精密机器都不受震动。机器安装队长谢明，是个转业干部，初到工地时连“地脚螺丝”是什么也不懂。但他经常跟随技术人员深入现场学习，并请工程师给自己讲课，所以逐渐熟悉了业务。他所领导的安装队提前五个月完成了安装任务，并积累一套经验，安装质量也为苏联专家所赞许。（附图片）
