Xinhua News Agency, dated Hanoi, 4th: General Văn Tiến Dũng, Chief Representative of the Delegation of the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army, delivered a memorandum to General Debesse, Chief Representative of the Delegation of the General Headquarters of the French Union Forces, on November 2nd, protesting against the atrocities committed by the French Union Forces against civilians and acts of retaliation against people who had participated in the resistance war.

The memorandum pointed out: Since the ceasefire in Vietnam, in the areas controlled by the French Union Forces, the French Union Forces have repeatedly violated the democratic freedoms, lives, and property of civilians from south to north. Particularly serious are the acts of terror and massacre against civilians, and retaliation against those who participated in the resistance war and now live in areas controlled by the French Union Forces.

According to incomplete figures, from the date of the ceasefire to the beginning of October 1954, the French Union Forces committed 578 acts of terror, killing 574 people, injuring 2,641, and arresting another 5,364. They carried out 131 acts of retaliation against people who had participated in the resistance war, killing 45, injuring 145, and arresting another 748.

The memorandum then listed some of the main specific facts of the atrocities committed by the French Union Forces against civilians and acts of retaliation against those who had participated in the resistance war, and then pointed out: The nature of the above-mentioned violations of the agreement is serious. First, it violates the provisions of Articles 15 and 14 of the Armistice Agreement. It is worth noting that those who are responsible for the correct implementation of the agreement are also the ones who are infringing upon the lives and property of residents and retaliating against people who participated in the resistance war.

The memorandum pointed out that these violations of the agreement by the French Union Forces have developed from small-scale attacks to real military operations involving entire companies and battalions, sometimes with the assistance of military vehicles and aircraft; from arresting a few people to detaining hundreds and thousands of people, from massacring a few people to massacring hundreds and thousands of people. The General Headquarters of the French Union Forces has not taken any concrete measures to stop or prevent these increasing incidents from happening.

The memorandum further pointed out: The acts of terror, massacre, and retaliation carried out by the French Union Forces have created a situation of insecurity among the people living under their control. This is detrimental to the consolidation of peace restored in Indochina.

The memorandum finally strongly protested against the French Union Forces' violations of the Armistice Agreement and demanded that the General Headquarters of the French Union Forces state its attitude towards these acts.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 10th: The French Union Forces are constantly infringing upon the lives and property and democratic freedoms of the people in the regrouping areas of South and Central Vietnam, and retaliating against patriotic people who participated in the resistance war.

In South Vietnam, two serious incidents of the French Union Forces massacring people occurred in late October. On October 20th, the French Union Forces in Sa Dec Province went to Long Hung Commune (township) to conscript laborers. A farmer named Wei could not go due to illness. The soldiers of the French Union Forces beat him severely, locked him in a stronghold, and opened fire on people who came to demand the release of the farmer, resulting in 13 deaths and 12 injuries. On October 25th, the French Union Forces at a stronghold in the Can Tho area beat to death a barber named Bính from Vĩnh Xuân Commune (township) under the pretext of checking ID cards. The people decided to complain to the nearby Joint Ceasefire Group, but three days later, a company of the French Union Forces went to Vĩnh Xuân Commune (township) to force the people to destroy Bính's body in order to eliminate evidence of the crime, and then opened fire on the masses, killing 23 people and wounding 116 people on the spot. The French Union Forces also took the opportunity to rob more than 100 bicycles. On the 30th, the French Union Forces arrested 70 farmers from Vĩnh Xuân Commune (township).

These kinds of incidents have been occurring constantly since the ceasefire in Vietnam. According to extremely incomplete statistics, in the thirty-odd days from August 11th to September 15th, a total of 235 terrorist incidents occurred in South Vietnam; among them, in 22 cases, the French Union Forces opened fire and threw grenades at people who were meeting to celebrate peace, resulting in 32 deaths, more than 300 injuries, and more than 2,000 arrests. The French Union Forces subjected those arrested to torture and secretly executed many of those arrested by extremely cruel methods such as burying them alive, beheading them, and disemboweling them to take their hearts. For example, in the Mễ Chi incident in Bến Tre Province, among the 189 people arrested by the French Union Forces, ten farmers were tied with stones and thrown into the river to drown.

In the Central Vietnam areas from which the Vietnam People's Army withdrew in accordance with the Armistice Agreement, the French Union Forces have also been constantly arresting and massacring people. In the seven days from September 4th to September 10th, three serious incidents of massacring peaceful residents occurred consecutively in Trạch Đức in Quảng Nam Province, Ngân Sơn in Phú Yên Province, and Cam Lộ in Quảng Trị Province.

At the same time, the French Union Forces have been constantly persecuting patriotic people who had participated in the resistance war and have now returned to their hometowns to engage in production. In Central Vietnam, the French Union Forces even issued "rewards" for capturing patriotic people; in South Vietnam, in the fifty days since the start of the ceasefire, more than 200 incidents of killing former resistance cadres have occurred.

Representatives of the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army have repeatedly protested against the above-mentioned serious violations of the Armistice Agreement and acts of terror by the French Union Forces, but the French side's representatives have repeatedly used the excuse that these are their "internal affairs" and refused to discuss or investigate these incidents. Representatives of the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army have had to submit these issues to the International Supervisory and Control Commission in Vietnam for processing.

    越南人民军总司令部代表
    抗议法方屠杀平民和进行报复等非法行为
    【新华社六日讯】据越南通讯社河内四日讯：越南人民军总司令部代表团首席代表文进勇将军十一月二日把一份备忘录送交法兰西联邦部队总司令部代表团首席代表德布勒比松将军，抗议法兰西联邦部队对平民的暴行以及对曾参加抗战的人们的报复行为。
    备忘录指出：自从越南实行停火以来，在法兰西联邦部队控制着的地区内，法兰西联邦部队从南到北一再侵犯平民的民主自由、生命和财产；特别严重的是对平民进行恐怖活动和屠杀，以及对那些曾参加抗战、现在住在法兰西联邦部队控制着的地区中的人们进行报复。
    据不完全的数字，法兰西联邦部队自停火日起到一九五四年十月初止，犯了五百七十八件恐怖行为，杀害了五百七十四人，打伤了两千六百四十一人，另逮捕了五千三百六十四人；对曾参加抗战的人们进行了一百三十一次报复，杀害了四十五人，打伤了一百四十五人，另逮捕了七百四十八人。
    备忘录接着列举了法兰西联邦部队对平民的暴行以及对曾参加抗战的人们的报复行为的一些主要具体事实，然后指出：上述违反协定的行为的性质是严重的。首先是它违反了停战协定第十五条和第十四条的规定。值得注意的是：那些负有正确执行协定任务的人也正是那些侵犯居民的生命财产以及对曾参加抗战的人们进行报复的人。
    备忘录指出法兰西联邦部队这些违反协定的行为是从小型的袭击发展到有整连整营参加的、有时还有军用车辆和飞机协助的真正军事行动；从逮捕少数几人发展到拘留成百成千的人，从屠杀少数几人发展到屠杀成百成千的人。法兰西联邦部队总司令部并未采取任何具体的措施来制止或防止这些日益增加的事件的发生。
    备忘录又指出：法兰西联邦部队所进行的恐怖、屠杀和报复行动已在生活在他们控制下的人民中造成了一种不安全的局面。这对在印度支那恢复的和平的巩固是有害的。
    备忘录最后强烈抗议法兰西联邦部队违反停战协定的行为，并要求法兰西联邦部队总司令部表明它对这些行为的态度。
    【新华社河内十日电】法兰西联邦部队不断侵犯南越和中越集结区内人民的生命财产和民主自由，并对曾参加抗战的爱国人民进行报复。
    在南越，在十月下旬就发生了两起法兰西联邦部队屠杀人民的严重事件。十月二十日，沙沥省的法兰西联邦部队到龙兴社（乡）抓伕，有一个叫威的农民因病不能去，法兰西联邦部队的士兵在把他毒打一顿后把他关到据点里去，并向前来要求释放这个农民的人开火，结果死十三人，伤十二人。十月二十五日，芹苴地区一个据点的法兰西联邦部队以检查身份证为名打死了永春社（乡）一个叫丙的理发员。人民决定向附近的联合停战小组控诉，但是三天之后，法兰西联邦部队一个连开到永春社（乡）来强迫人民毁掉丙的尸体，以消灭罪证，接着又向群众开枪，当场有二十三人被打死，一百一十六人被打伤，法兰西联邦部队还乘机抢去了一百多辆自行车。三十日，法兰西联邦部队又逮捕了永春社（乡）的七十个农民。
    这类事件从越南停战以来不断发生。据极不完全的统计，自八月十一日到九月十五日的三十多天中，南越共发生恐怖事件二百三十五起；其中有二十二起是法兰西联邦部队向开会庆祝和平的人民开枪和投掷手榴弹，因此有三十二人被打死，被打伤的有三百多人，被逮捕的有两千多人。法兰西联邦部队对被捕的人施以肉刑，并用活埋、砍杀、剖腹取心等极端残酷的办法把许多被捕的人秘密处死。例如在槟椥省楳棋事件中，在被法兰西联邦部队逮捕的一百八十九人中，有十个农民被绑上石头丢到河里淹死。
    在越南人民军根据停战协定撤离的中越地区，法兰西联邦部队也不断逮捕和屠杀人民。在从九月四日到九月十日的七天中，就连续在广南省的泽德、富安省的银山、广治省的甘露发生了三件屠杀和平居民的严重事件。
    同时，法兰西联邦部队还不断迫害曾经参加抗战、现在已经回乡生产的爱国人民。在中越、法兰西联邦部队竟出了捉捕爱国人民的“赏格”；在南越，自停战开始后的五十天中，已发生杀害前抗战干部的事件二百多起。
    越南人民军总司令部的代表对法兰西联邦部队上述严重违反停战协定的恐怖行为不断提出抗议，但是法方代表一再借口这是他们的“内政问题”，拒绝讨论和拒绝对这些事件进行调查。越南人民军总司令部的代表不得不将这些问题提交越南国际监督和监察委员会处理。
