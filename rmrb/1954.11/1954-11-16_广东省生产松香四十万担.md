Guangdong Province Produces 400,000 Dan of Rosin

    Peasant farmers in the mountainous areas of Guangdong Province are actively organizing surplus labor to engage in rosin tapping and production to support national industrial construction. As of October, the province has tapped and produced approximately 400,000 dan of rosin this year, exceeding the total annual output of last year by more than double.
    Rosin production in Guangdong Province is widespread and abundant. Farmers in the mountainous areas of central, eastern, and northern Guangdong often consider rosin tapping as their main sideline. However, in the past, many farmers did not fully understand the important significance of rosin production, and tapped very little. In order to promote rosin production, various localities repeatedly publicized the importance of rosin production to farmers. At the same time, state-owned commercial departments established more rosin purchasing stations in rosin-producing areas to facilitate farmers' sales of rosin, thereby greatly encouraging farmers' production enthusiasm. After farmers in Guangsi County viewed the rosin exhibition, the number of farmers tapping rosin in the county immediately increased by 30%. Many farmers, in order to tap rosin without affecting agricultural production, organized mutual aid teams to divide the work. Now that the climate has turned cold and the peak season for rosin production has passed, farmers in eastern and central Guangdong are still actively seizing the time to tap more rosin to support national industrialization.

    广东省生产松香四十万担
    广东省山区农民积极组织剩余劳动力，从事采割松香生产，以支援国家工业建设。截至十月份止，今年全省已采割松香四十万担左右，超过去年全年总产量一倍以上。
    广东省松香生产遍及全省，产量丰盛。粤中、粤东、粤北等山区农民多以采割松香为主要副业。但过去许多农民由于对松香生产的重要意义认识不足，采割松香很少。各地为了促进松香生产，反复地向农民宣传松香生产重要性，同时国营商业部门在各松香产区增设了松香收购站，便利农民出售松香，因此大大鼓舞了农民生产积极性。广四县农民看了松香展览会后，全县采割松香的农民随即增加了百分之三十。许多农民为了使采割松香而不影响农业生产，组织了互助组，分工进行生产。现在气候已转冷，松香生产的旺季已过，粤东、粤中等地农民仍积极争取时间多割松香支援国家工业化。
