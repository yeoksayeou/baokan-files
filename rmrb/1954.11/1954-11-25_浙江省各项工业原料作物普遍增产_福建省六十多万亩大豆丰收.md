    Zhejiang Province Achieves Universal Increase in Production of Various Industrial Raw Material Crops
    Fujian Province Reaps a Bumper Harvest of Soybeans on Over 600,000 Mu

    Zhejiang Province has seen increased production of all industrial raw material crops this year. Silkworm cocoons and ramie, whose output ranks first in the country, although only fulfilling about 90% of the original plan, still increased by more than 7% and about 10% respectively compared to last year. The output of cotton, Chinese grass linen, and sugarcane is expected to exceed the original plan by more than 4%.

    Between spring and summer this year, just as farmers began raising spring silkworms and sowing cotton and flax, the silkworm cocoon production areas and cotton and flax production areas of Zhejiang Province experienced rain and flood disasters unseen in decades. The Communist Party of China organizations at all levels in Zhejiang Province promptly led the farmers to drain the water and carry out emergency rescue work. The People's Government also dispatched a large number of technical cadres to the countryside to help farmers improve various technical measures, thereby mitigating the disaster. After the rain and floods in August, farmers in various places launched a campaign for exceeding production targets, putting forward the slogan of "no reduction in production despite the disaster." Farmers in cotton and flax production areas strengthened late-stage topdressing and pest control, greatly increasing the yield per unit area. Farmers in silkworm cocoon production areas increased the breeding of summer and autumn silkworm eggs by more than 110,000 sheets to compensate for the losses suffered by spring silkworms in some areas. Among them, the output of autumn cocoons increased by nearly half compared to last year.

    Fujian Province has reaped a bumper harvest of autumn soybeans on more than 600,000 mu, with an estimated output of more than 45 million jin. Farmers in various places are busy drying and winnowing the soybeans, preparing to sell all of them to the state, except for the good seeds that will be kept. The state plans to supply this batch of soybeans to the People's Liberation Army on the coastal defense front lines as non-staple food.

    This year, due to farmers utilizing idle autumn land and sweet potato ridges, the autumn soybean planting area in Fujian Province expanded by more than 80,000 mu compared to last year. Farmers in various places have also changed their past habits of not applying fertilizer and not catching insects, actively improving the quality of cultivation, and have achieved a bumper harvest of autumn soybeans.

### 浙江省各项工业原料作物普遍增产  福建省六十多万亩大豆丰收

    浙江省各项工业原料作物普遍增产
    福建省六十多万亩大豆丰收
    浙江省今年各项工业原料作物都增产了。产量占全国第一位的蚕茧和络麻，虽然只完成原定计划百分之九十上下，但仍比去年分别增产百分之七强和百分之十左右。棉花、苎麻和甘蔗的产量，预计可以超过原定计划百分之四以上。
    今年春、夏之间，正当农民开始饲养春蚕和播种棉、麻的时候，浙江省蚕茧产区和棉、麻产区发生了几十年来没有过的雨涝灾害。中共浙江省各级组织及时领导农民排涝抢救，人民政府也调派了大批技术干部到农村，帮助农民改善各种技术措施，因而减轻了灾害。八月间，雨涝过后，各地农民又展开超额增产运动，提出“受灾不减产”的口号。棉、麻产区农民分别加强了后期追肥和除虫工作，大大提高了单位面积产量。蚕茧产区农民为了弥补部分地区春蚕所受的损失，增养夏、秋蚕种十一万多张。其中秋茧产量比去年增加近一半。

    福建省六十多万亩秋大豆丰收，估计可产四千五百多万斤。各地农民正忙着把大豆晒干颺净，准备除留下良种外全部卖给国家。国家准备把这批大豆供应海防前线人民解放军作副食品用。
    今年由于农民利用了秋闲地和蕃薯畦，福建省秋大豆种植面积比去年扩大了八万多亩。各地农民并改变了过去不施肥、不捉虫的习惯，积极提高耕作质量，取得了秋大豆的丰收。（新华社）
