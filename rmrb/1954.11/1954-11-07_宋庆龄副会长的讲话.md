Comrades! Friends!

    Today, we celebrate the 37th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution with extraordinary joy and excitement. Thirty-seven years is a very short period in history, but these thirty-seven years are worth the entire past century, or even several centuries. Because during this period, mankind has made tremendous progress. The cause of human liberation, initiated by the October Revolution, has been victorious on a vast expanse of land on Earth. A force of peace, democracy, and socialism, headed by the Soviet Union, has emerged in the world, possessing one-third of the world's population and continuously growing. In addition, a movement to defend world peace and strive for democracy and independence has unfolded worldwide. This is the most deeply rooted and most powerful movement of modern times, making the imperialist warmongers tremble with fear. Our two countries, China and the Soviet Union, stand at the forefront of this movement. Looking back at the past, we will see that our struggles have been fruitful. Therefore, we greet the future with even greater optimism and confidence.

    The great October Socialist Revolution shook the world and fundamentally changed the course of human history. Sun Yat-sen was the first to welcome this revolution, pointing out: "Because of the Russian Revolution, a great hope has been born for humanity in the world." In fact, this great hope born thirty-seven years ago has already been realized in our motherland. When the Soviet Union was first born, not a single country considered her a friend or ally. She was blockaded and surrounded from all sides and was once the battlefield where all imperialists vented their anger. Many cities in the Soviet Union were threatened by interventionist troops. The imperialist interventionist troops were at the gates of Leningrad, the Japanese occupied Vladivostok, the Allied forces occupied the Arkhangelsk region, the Germans occupied Ukraine, the Czechoslovakians occupied the Volga River basin, and the White Guards occupied the Don Cossack region. The people of the Soviet Union endured several years of civil war manipulated by imperialists with money. Counter-revolutionaries were scattered everywhere, while famine and disease spread throughout the country. The situation was very serious. All the reactionary forces in the world wanted to strangle this newborn of freedom. But the Soviet people did not compromise and took up all the weapons they could use to fight. Workers all over the world rose up to defend them. Workers all over the world stood by the Soviet people and supported their struggle. As Lenin said: "When the international bourgeoisie started to beat us, their hands were grabbed by their own workers." The Soviet people, with their incomparably strong will, perseverance, their unwavering belief in the cause of the people, and their concerted efforts, finally triumphed.

    As the Soviet Union celebrates the 37th anniversary of the October Revolution today, her progress and prosperity have been written into human history. She has become the greatest fortress of peace and progress in the world. She has made her own contributions in all fields of human endeavor. In today's stormy sea of international tension, the Soviet Union's unwavering and consistent peace policy has become a beacon of peace and friendship, shining brightly on millions of people and nations around the world.

    In the past thirty years, the Soviet Union has been our constant and loyal friend in the struggle of the Chinese people against enemies at home and abroad. Because the October Revolution produced such a new type of country, she treats all nations with equality and friendship. The Chinese people will never forget that it was the Soviet Union that took the initiative to renounce the unequal treaties signed by Tsarist Russia and China. We also remember the assistance the Soviet Union gave us during the Great Revolution of China from 1924 to 1927. In addition, we remember the assistance the Soviet Union gave us during the Anti-Japanese War, especially the tremendous assistance given by the Soviet Union's dispatch of troops to the Northeast in 1945, which enabled us to finally eliminate the Japanese Kwantung Army.

    After the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, achieved victory in the People's Revolution and established the People's Republic of China, this long-standing relationship, this friendship and assistance, reached a new height. The Soviet Union was the first to recognize our country. After thirty years of revolutionary experience, the Chinese people have realized the correctness of Chairman Mao's proposition to form an alliance with the Soviet Union. The Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance signed between China and the Soviet Union on February 14, 1950, is the best proof of this relationship.

    Now, not only the great Soviet people, but also our Chinese people have stood up. The great revolutionary Sun Yat-sen earnestly hoped that all oppressed nations in the world would unite and fight for their own liberation. In the process of realizing this hope, the great Soviet Union and our China, like two giants, are advancing hand in hand and shoulder to shoulder towards victory. The strength of the Sino-Soviet friendship alliance is infinite and invincible. This is primarily because both of our countries are peace-loving countries. We are both creating a happy and fulfilling new life through peaceful labor. We urgently need a peaceful environment to build our own beautiful countries. Therefore, we are both using all our strength and all possible means to consolidate and develop the sacred cause of world peace and international security. This joint effort by China and the Soviet Union not only fully conforms to the interests of our two peoples, but also conforms to the fundamental interests of all the people of the world. Therefore, it cannot but win the trust and heartfelt support of the people of all countries. This is the source of our strength. This is the truth of living reality. Whoever ignores or deviates from this truth will be abandoned by life. Please, leaders of the American aggressive bloc, clear your minds, face this truth squarely, and correctly assess our strength. If they remain stubborn, disregard this irresistible truth, and continue to recklessly implement their policies of aggression and strength, then they will surely be met with crushing defeats until their final failure.

    Our two countries' economic cooperation and cultural exchange have been expanding over the past five years. Obviously, this has brought great benefits to both China and the Soviet Union, especially to our country. China is a backward country. We need not only to learn but also to be assisted in building up our weak technological base. Our enemy, American imperialism, is afraid of our prosperity and strength. It has implemented a policy of "blockade" against us, hoping that we would collapse and that economic construction would overwhelm us. But it has completely miscalculated. At the beginning of our nation-building, when arduous recovery work was before us, the Soviet Union extended a hand of friendship and assistance to us, supporting us with loans, dispatching experts, developing trade between the two countries, and establishing joint-stock companies. When we victoriously completed the recovery work and entered the stage of planned socialist construction, the Soviet Union provided invaluable assistance to our first Five-Year Plan, giving us various generous and selfless assistance. It has given comprehensive assistance to the backbone of our construction projects, one hundred and forty-one important projects, and fifteen newly decided industrial enterprises. It is a great initiative that has never existed and could never exist in the international relations history of the old era for one country to have such concern for another. Our cultural cooperation has enabled us to exchange the wisdom and experience of our two countries, thereby enriching ourselves even more.

    The recently published communiqué and other documents following the talks between the governments of China and the Soviet Union have opened a new page in the history of Sino-Soviet friendship. This is a summary of our five years of friendly cooperation and a new development of this relationship. People all over the world have given this event enthusiastic cheers, because the further consolidation of Sino-Soviet relations is consistent with their vital interests.

    These documents demonstrate the firm will of more than 800 million people in our two countries to safeguard international peace. Many pressing international issues can be found answered in these documents. We believe that the policy of the American imperialist leadership group to obstruct the People's Republic of China from obtaining its legitimate status in the United Nations is completely unfounded. We believe that the American imperialist's direct acts of aggression against our country, especially the continued occupation of our territory of Taiwan and military and financial assistance to Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous group, are incompatible with the task of maintaining peace in the Far East and easing international tensions. We believe that Korea, which is still divided into two parts, is not in accordance with the wishes of the Korean people and is abnormal. We believe that the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc pieced together by imperialism endangers the security and national independence of Asian countries and endangers the peaceful interests of Asia and the Pacific region. At the same time, we clearly stated that we are willing to develop mutual relations with countries in the Asia-Pacific region and other countries on the basis of strictly abiding by the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. This is the common view and proposition of the more than 800 million people of our two countries, China and the Soviet Union. The American aggressive group is still using deception and frustrating people's confidence to paralyze the fighting will of the people of various countries. Now the people of various countries increasingly understand our views and propositions. They are fighting for their own independence and freedom and building their own better lives. Their common and most urgent demand is peace, security, and peaceful coexistence among countries.

    Japanese militarism is the deadly enemy of the people of our two countries, China and the Soviet Union. They have caused us indescribable pain and enormous losses. But we do not have the intention of retaliation against the Japanese nation. On the contrary, we deeply sympathize with the plight of the Japanese nation and express concern about Japan being led by the American imperialism onto a dangerous path of arms expansion. We also clearly stated that we trust the Japanese people, that they can find the strength in themselves to break free from the chains that bind them and move towards national independence and peaceful development. We are willing to develop trade relations with Japan and establish close cultural ties with Japan on the basis of the principle of peaceful coexistence. Japan will receive full support from China and the USSR in its efforts to establish political and economic relations with the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union. Similarly, all steps taken by Japan to safeguard its conditions for peace and independent development will also receive full support from China and the USSR. There is no doubt that all Japanese people with national self-esteem will agree with our views and positions, and their desire for peace will surely be realized.

    The more our Sino-Soviet friendship develops, the stronger the forces of peace, democracy, and socialism become, and the more hopeful the realization of lasting world peace becomes. This is also known to the enemies of peace. Therefore, they are very afraid of our friendship. They use all kinds of lies to deceive the people of their country. They dream that there will be a gap in Sino-Soviet relations. But facts prove that they are in vain. The friendly relations between the people of China and the Soviet Union will always be close and inseparable.

    Our cause is just. As Chairman Mao said, a just cause is forever invincible.

    The people of the world trust us and place their greatest hopes on us. Let us unite more closely for the cause of world peace and human happiness!

    Long live the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union!

    Long live world peace!

### 宋庆龄副会长的讲话

    宋庆龄副会长的讲话同志们！朋友们！
    今天我们怀着异常欢欣鼓舞的心情来庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命的三十七周年。三十七年在历史上是一个很短的时期，可是这三十七年却抵得上过去的整个世纪，甚至几个世纪。因为在这个时期中间，人类有了巨大的进步。由十月革命发端的人类自由解放的事业，已经在地球上的一片广大土地上得到了胜利。在世界上出现了以苏联为首的和平、民主、社会主义力量，她拥有全人类三分之一的人口，并在不断地壮大。此外，在全世界范围内展开了保卫世界和平、争取民主和独立的运动，这是现代最深入人心、最强大有力的运动，它使帝国主义战争贩子们望而生畏。我们中苏两国就站在这个运动的最前列。回顾一下过去，我们会看到我们的奋斗是有成绩的，因此，我们更以高度的乐观精神和自信心来迎接着未来。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命震撼了全世界，并且根本改变了人类历史的进程，孙中山曾首先欢迎这个革命，并且指出：“因为有了俄国革命，世界人类便生出了一个伟大的希望”。实际上，这个在三十七年前所生出的这个伟大的希望，已在我们祖国实现了。苏联在她刚诞生的时候起，没有一个国家作为她的朋友或是同盟者。她被从四面八方封锁包围着，并且曾经一度成为所有帝国主义者发泄他们愤激的战场。苏联的许多城市受到干涉军的威胁。帝国主义干涉军曾兵临列宁格勒城下，日本人占领了海参崴，协约国军队进占了阿尔汉格尔区，德国人占领了乌克兰，捷克斯洛伐克人占领了伏尔加河流域，而白卫军则占领了顿河哥萨克区。苏联的人民忍受了由帝国主义者用金钱所操纵的国内战争的几个年头，反革命分子散布于各地，而同时灾荒和疫病又蔓延于全国。情况是十分严重的。全世界的反动力量都想窒死这个自由的新生儿。但是苏联人民并没有妥协，并且拿起一切可以运用的武器来作战。全世界的工人都起来保卫他们。全世界的工人们都站在苏联人民的一边，支援他们的斗争。正像列宁所说：“当国际资产阶级动手来打我们的时候，他们的手就被他们自己的工人抓住了”。苏联人民由于他们无比坚强的意志、毅力，他们对人民的事业和他们同心协力的不移信念，他们终于胜利了。
    当苏联今天欢庆十月革命三十七周年的时候，人类历史上已写上了她的进步和繁荣。她已经成为世界上和平与进步的最伟大的堡垒。她在人类事业的各个领域中都作出了自己的贡献。在今天国际紧张局势的风暴的大海当中，苏联的坚定不移的和始终一贯的和平政策，已成为照耀着全世界千千万万人和各国人民的和平与友好的光芒万丈的灯塔。
    在过去三十多年来，中国人民和国内外敌人所进行的斗争中，苏联是我们始终不变的和忠实的朋友。因为十月革命产生了这样一个新型的国家，她以平等与友好对待所有的民族。中国人民永远不会忘记是苏联主动放弃了帝俄和中国所订的不平等条约。我们也记得苏联当中国一九二四年至一九二七年大革命时所给予我们的援助。此外，我们还记得当抗日战争时期苏联给予我们的援助，特别是一九四五年苏联出兵东北时所给予的巨大的援助，使我们能最后肃清了日本关东军。
    中国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导之下取得了人民革命的胜利和建立了中华人民共和国以后，这种历史悠久的关系，这种友谊和援助，更达到了一个新的高度。苏联是第一个承认我们国家的。经过三十年来的革命经验，中国人民已经认识到毛主席主张和苏联结成同盟的正确性。中苏两国在一九五○年二月十四日所签订的友好同盟互助条约，就是这种关系的一个最好的明证。
    现在，不但伟大的苏联人民，而且我们中国人民也已经站立起来了。伟大的革命家孙中山曾殷切地期望全世界被压迫民族团结起来为着自己的解放而奋斗。在实现这一期望的过程中，伟大的苏联和我们中国正像两个巨人一样，手携手、肩并肩地向着胜利共同前进。中苏两国友好同盟的力量是无限的，是不可战胜的。这首先是因为我们两国都是和平的国家，我们都在用和平的劳动创造着美满幸福的新生活，我们迫切地需要和平的环境来建设我们自己美好的国家。因而我们都在用一切力量，通过一切途径，来巩固和发展世界和平与国际安全的神圣事业。中苏两国的这种共同努力不仅完全符合我们两国人民的利益，而且符合全世界各国人民的根本利益，因而不能不取得各国人民的信任和衷心拥护。这就是我们的力量的源泉。这是活生生的实际生活的真理。谁要忽视或者离开这个真理，生活就会把他们抛弃在后边。请美国侵略集团的头子们清醒一下自己的头脑，正视这个真理，正确地估计我们的力量吧。如果他们仍然固执己见，漠视那种不可抗拒的真理，仍然放肆地实行他们的侵略政策和实力政策，那么他们将要碰得头破血流直到最后失败，这是肯定的。
    我们两国五年来的经济合作和文化交流事业日益扩大。很明显，这给中苏两国，特别是我国，带来很大的利益。中国是一个落后的国家。我们要在薄弱的技术基础上建设起来，就不仅需要学习，而且需要援助。我们的敌人——美帝国主义对我们的繁荣富强是害怕的，它实行了“封锁”我们的政策，满心想望叫我们垮台，叫经济建设难倒我们。但它完全失算了。在我们建国之初，当繁重的恢复工作摆在我们面前的时候，苏联向我们伸出了友谊和援助的手，用贷款、派遣专家、发展两国贸易、创办合股公司种种办法来支援我们。当我们胜利完成了恢复工作，进入有计划的社会主义建设阶段的时候，苏联对我们的第一个五年计划又给了不可估量的帮助，给予我们各种慷慨无私的援助。对我国建设项目中的骨干，一百四十一项重要工程和不久前所决定的十五项新建的工业企业，更给了全面的帮助。一个国家对另一个国家有如此的关心，这是旧时代国际关系史中从来没有的、也不可能有的伟大创举。我们之间的文化合作使我们两国的智慧与经验得到了交换，并从而使我们更加丰富了自己。
    最近中苏两国政府举行会谈后发表的公报和其他的文件，为中苏友谊的历史开辟了新的一页。这是我们五年来友好合作的总结，又是这种关系的新的发展。全世界人民都对这个事件发出了热情的欢呼，因为中苏关系的进一步巩固是和他们的切身利益相一致的。
    在这些文件里，表现了我们两国八亿多人民的维护国际和平的坚强的意志。许多迫切的国际问题，在这些文件里都可以找到回答的。我们认为阻挠中华人民共和国在联合国中取得合法地位的美帝国主义领导集团的政策，是完全没有根据的。我们认为美帝国主义对我国的直接侵略行为，特别是对我国领土台湾的继续侵占以及对我国人民公敌蒋介石卖国集团的军事财政援助，是和维护远东和平与缓和国际紧张局势的任务不相容的。我们认为朝鲜至今仍然分裂为两部分，是不符合朝鲜人民的愿望的，是不正常的。我们认为帝国主义拼凑的东南亚侵略集团是危害亚洲各国的安全和民族独立，是危害亚洲和太平洋区域的和平利益的。同时，我们明确地表示，我们愿意在严格遵守互相尊重主权和领土完整、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处的各项原则的基础上，同亚洲和太平洋区域的国家及其他的国家发展相互的关系。这就是我们中苏两国八亿多人民的共同观点和主张。美国侵略集团还在用欺骗和挫折人们信心的办法来麻痹各国人民的斗争意志。现在各国人民日益明白我们的看法和主张。他们正在为争取自己的独立和自由，建设自己的美好生活而奋斗。他们共同的和最迫切的要求，就是和平，就是安全，就是各国的和平共处。
    日本的军国主义是我们中苏两国人民的死敌，他们曾使我们遭受难以述说的苦痛和浩大的损失。但我们对于日本民族并没有报复的企图，相反地，我们对于日本民族的苦难处境深表同情，对于日本被美帝国主义牵着鼻子走上危险的备战道路，表示忧虑。我们也明确地表示：我们对日本人民是信任的，他们能从自己身上找出力量来挣脱束缚他们的锁链，而走向民族独立与和平发展的道路；我们愿意根据和平共处的原则和日本发展贸易关系，并同日本建立密切的文化联系；日本在致力同中华人民共和国和苏联建立政治关系和经济关系方面，将会得到中苏方面完全的支持，同样，日本为保障它的和平与独立发展的条件所采取的一切步骤也将得到中苏方面的完全支持。毫无疑问，一切有民族自尊心的日本人，都会同意我们的见解和立场的，他们的和平愿望一定可能实现的。
    我们中苏两国的友谊愈发展，和平、民主和社会主义力量就越强大，世界的持久和平就愈加有希望实现。这是和平的敌人也知道的。因此，他们十分害怕我们的友谊。他们用种种谎言欺骗他们国家的人民。他们做梦都在想中苏关系会发生缝隙。但事实证明他们是徒劳的。中苏两国人民的友好关系永远是亲密无间的。
    我们的事业是正义的。正如毛主席所说的，正义的事业永远是攻不破的。
    全世界人民信任我们，寄予我们以最大的希望。让我们为了全世界的和平与人类幸福的事业更加紧密地团结在一起吧！
    中苏两个伟大民族的永恒的牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
