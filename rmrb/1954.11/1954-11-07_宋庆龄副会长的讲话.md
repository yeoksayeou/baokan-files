Comrades! Friends!

    Today, we celebrate the 37th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution with extraordinary joy and excitement. Thirty-seven years is a very short period in history, but these thirty-seven years are worth the entire past century, or even several centuries. Because during this period, mankind has made tremendous progress. The cause of human liberation, initiated by the October Revolution, has been victorious on a vast expanse of land on Earth. A force of peace, democracy, and socialism, headed by the Soviet Union, has emerged in the world, possessing one-third of the world's population and continuously growing. In addition, a movement to defend world peace and strive for democracy and independence has unfolded worldwide. This is the most deeply rooted and most powerful movement of modern times, making the imperialist warmongers tremble with fear. Our two countries, China and the Soviet Union, stand at the forefront of this movement. Looking back at the past, we will see that our struggles have been fruitful. Therefore, we greet the future with even greater optimism and confidence.

    The great October Socialist Revolution shook the world and fundamentally changed the course of human history. Sun Yat-sen was the first to welcome this revolution, pointing out: "Because of the Russian Revolution, a great hope has been born for humanity in the world." In fact, this great hope born thirty-seven years ago has already been realized in our motherland. When the Soviet Union was first born, not a single country considered her a friend or ally. She was blockaded and surrounded from all sides and was once the battlefield where all imperialists vented their anger. Many cities in the Soviet Union were threatened by interventionist troops. The imperialist interventionist troops were at the gates of Leningrad, the Japanese occupied Vladivostok, the Allied forces occupied the Arkhangelsk region, the Germans occupied Ukraine, the Czechoslovakians occupied the Volga River basin, and the White Guards occupied the Don Cossack region. The people of the Soviet Union endured several years of civil war manipulated by imperialists with money. Counter-revolutionaries were scattered everywhere, while famine and disease spread throughout the country. The situation was very serious. All the reactionary forces in the world wanted to strangle this newborn of freedom. But the Soviet people did not compromise and took up all the weapons they could use to fight. Workers all over the world rose up to defend them. Workers all over the world stood by the Soviet people and supported their struggle. As Lenin said: "When the international bourgeoisie started to beat us, their hands were grabbed by their own workers." The Soviet people, with their incomparably strong will, perseverance, their unwavering belief in the cause of the people, and their concerted efforts, finally triumphed.

    As the Soviet Union celebrates the 37th anniversary of the October Revolution today, her progress and prosperity have been written into human history. She has become the greatest fortress of peace and progress in the world. She has made her own contributions in all fields of human endeavor. In today's stormy sea of international tension, the Soviet Union's unwavering and consistent peace policy has become a beacon of peace and friendship, shining brightly on millions of people and nations around the world.

    In the past thirty years, the Soviet Union has been our constant and loyal friend in the struggle of the Chinese people against enemies at home and abroad. Because the October Revolution produced such a new type of country, she treats all nations with equality and friendship. The Chinese people will never forget that it was the Soviet Union that took the initiative to renounce the unequal treaties signed by Tsarist Russia and China. We also remember the assistance the Soviet Union gave us during the Great Revolution of China from 1924 to 1927. In addition, we remember the assistance the Soviet Union gave us during the Anti-Japanese War, especially the tremendous assistance given by the Soviet Union's dispatch of troops to the Northeast in 1945, which enabled us to finally eliminate the Japanese Kwantung Army.

    After the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, achieved victory in the People's Revolution and established the People's Republic of China, this long-standing relationship, this friendship and assistance, reached a new height. The Soviet Union was the first to recognize our country. After thirty years of revolutionary experience, the Chinese people have realized the correctness of Chairman Mao's proposition to form an alliance with the Soviet Union. The Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance signed between China and the Soviet Union on February 14, 1950, is the best proof of this relationship.

    Now, not only the great Soviet people, but also our Chinese people have stood up. The great revolutionary Sun Yat-sen earnestly hoped that all oppressed nations in the world would unite and fight for their own liberation. In the process of realizing this hope, the great Soviet Union and our China, like two giants, are advancing hand in hand and shoulder to shoulder towards victory. The strength of the Sino-Soviet friendship alliance is infinite and invincible. This is primarily because both of our countries are peace-loving countries. We are both creating a happy and fulfilling new life through peaceful labor. We urgently need a peaceful environment to build our own beautiful countries. Therefore, we are both using all our strength and all possible means to consolidate and develop the sacred cause of world peace and international security. This joint effort by China and the Soviet Union not only fully conforms to the interests of our two peoples, but also conforms to the fundamental interests of all the people of the world. Therefore, it cannot but win the trust and heartfelt support of the people of all countries. This is the source of our strength. This is the truth of living reality. Whoever ignores or deviates from this truth will be abandoned by life. Please, leaders of the American aggressive bloc, clear your minds, face this truth squarely, and correctly assess our strength. If they remain stubborn, disregard this irresistible truth, and continue to recklessly implement their policies of aggression and strength, then they will surely be met with crushing defeats until their final failure.

    Our two countries' economic cooperation and cultural exchange have been expanding over the past five years. Obviously, this has brought great benefits to both China and the Soviet Union, especially to our country. China is a backward country. We need not only to learn but also to be assisted in building up our weak technological base. Our enemy, American imperialism, is afraid of our prosperity and strength. It has implemented a policy of "blockade" against us, hoping that we would collapse and that economic construction would overwhelm us. But it has completely miscalculated. At the beginning of our nation-building, when arduous recovery work was before us, the Soviet Union extended a hand of friendship and assistance to us, supporting us with loans, dispatching experts, developing trade between the two countries, and establishing joint-stock companies. When we victoriously completed the recovery work and entered the stage of planned socialist construction, the Soviet Union provided invaluable assistance to our first Five-Year Plan, giving us various generous and selfless assistance. It has given comprehensive assistance to the backbone of our construction projects, one hundred and forty-one important projects, and fifteen newly decided industrial enterprises. It is a great initiative that has never existed and could never exist in the international relations history of the old era for one country to have such concern for another. Our cultural cooperation has enabled us to exchange the wisdom and experience of our two countries, thereby enriching ourselves even more.

    The recently published communiqu√© and other documents following the talks between the governments of China and the Soviet Union have opened a new page in the history of Sino-Soviet friendship. This is a summary of our five years of friendly cooperation and a new development of this relationship. People all over the world have given this event enthusiastic cheers, because the further consolidation of Sino-Soviet relations is consistent with their vital interests.

    These documents demonstrate the firm will of more than 800 million people in our two countries to safeguard international peace. Many pressing international issues can be found answered in these documents. We believe that the policy of the American imperialist leadership group to obstruct the People's Republic of China from obtaining its legitimate status in the United Nations is completely unfounded. We believe that the American imperialist's direct acts of aggression against our country, especially the continued occupation of our territory of Taiwan and military and financial assistance to Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous group, are incompatible with the task of maintaining peace in the Far East and easing international tensions. We believe that Korea, which is still divided into two parts, is not in accordance with the wishes of the Korean people and is abnormal. We believe that the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc pieced together by imperialism endangers the security and national independence of Asian countries and endangers the peaceful interests of Asia and the Pacific region. At the same time, we clearly stated that we are willing to develop mutual relations with countries in the Asia-Pacific region and other countries on the basis of strictly abiding by the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. This is the common view and proposition of the more than 800 million people of our two countries, China and the Soviet Union. The American aggressive group is still using deception and frustrating people's confidence to paralyze the fighting will of the people of various countries. Now the people of various countries increasingly understand our views and propositions. They are fighting for their own independence and freedom and building their own better lives. Their common and most urgent demand is peace, security, and peaceful coexistence among countries.

    Japanese militarism is the deadly enemy of the people of our two countries, China and the Soviet Union. They have caused us indescribable pain and enormous losses. But we do not have the intention of retaliation against the Japanese nation. On the contrary, we deeply sympathize with the plight of the Japanese nation and express concern about Japan being led by the American imperialism onto a dangerous path of arms expansion. We also clearly stated that we trust the Japanese people, that they can find the strength in themselves to break free from the chains that bind them and move towards national independence and peaceful development. We are willing to develop trade relations with Japan and establish close cultural ties with Japan on the basis of the principle of peaceful coexistence. Japan will receive full support from China and the USSR in its efforts to establish political and economic relations with the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union. Similarly, all steps taken by Japan to safeguard its conditions for peace and independent development will also receive full support from China and the USSR. There is no doubt that all Japanese people with national self-esteem will agree with our views and positions, and their desire for peace will surely be realized.

    The more our Sino-Soviet friendship develops, the stronger the forces of peace, democracy, and socialism become, and the more hopeful the realization of lasting world peace becomes. This is also known to the enemies of peace. Therefore, they are very afraid of our friendship. They use all kinds of lies to deceive the people of their country. They dream that there will be a gap in Sino-Soviet relations. But facts prove that they are in vain. The friendly relations between the people of China and the Soviet Union will always be close and inseparable.

    Our cause is just. As Chairman Mao said, a just cause is forever invincible.

    The people of the world trust us and place their greatest hopes on us. Let us unite more closely for the cause of world peace and human happiness!

    Long live the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union!

    Long live world peace!
