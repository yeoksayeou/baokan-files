To the Editor:

Yizheng County, Jiangsu Province, has seriously detached itself from the masses in the work of supplying crop seeds, delaying agricultural production and making it impossible to realize the agricultural production increase plan.

In July, when the floods were rising continuously, the county transferred 120,000 jin of rice from Zhenjiang, asking districts and townships to mobilize farmers to actively drain water and replant. The farmers reflected one after another: "It's too late, and the water is getting higher and higher every day. It's hard to protect the crops that have already been planted, so why replant late rice!" Because the leading organs did not consider the opinions of the masses, the replanting resulted in no harvest.

In August, the flood gradually receded. In order to make up for the losses of the disaster and shorten the disaster period, the farmers came to the county grain bureau one after another, requesting a large supply of mung bean seeds, but no one knew what the grain bureau was intending, so they simply didn't sell them. Later, when the time for sowing mung beans was past, the grain bureau notified the districts, saying: "Mung bean seeds can be supplied in large quantities." But no one wanted to buy this outdated seed.

In late September, when it was time to sow broad beans, large numbers of farmers came from dozens of miles away to the grain bureau to buy broad bean seeds every day. Although there were a large number of broad beans piled up in the warehouse, the leadership still did not allow them to be sold. Many farmers were introduced from the district to the county, and the county pushed them back to the district. They ran back and forth many times, but the seed problem was still not solved. At that time, the state-stipulated price of broad beans was only 900 yuan per jin, but the black market was already selling for 1,700 yuan. Since autumn, the key to the inability of farmers in Yizheng County to replant crops in a timely manner lies in the inability of the county people's government to supply seeds in a timely manner. I think the leadership of Yizheng County should conduct a profound review of this incident.

### 仪征县应该检查延误农时的错误

    仪征县应该检查延误农时的错误编辑同志：
    江苏省仪征县在供应农作物种籽工作中严重地脱离群众，延误农时，使农业增产计划不能实现。
    七月间，正当洪水不断上涨的时候，县里从镇江调进十二万斤稻子，要各区、乡动员农民积极排水补种，农民们纷纷反映：“时间太晚了，而且水势一天天的大，已种的庄稼都难保了，还补种什么晚稻啊！”由于领导机关没有考虑群众意见，结果补种了以后颗粒无收。
    八月间，大水渐退，农民们为了补救灾荒的损失，缩短灾期，都纷纷来到县粮食局要求大量供应绿豆种，但不知粮食局的用意何在，只是一概不卖。后来绿豆下种的时候过了，粮食局反而通知各区说：“绿豆种可以大量供应。”可是谁也不愿去买这种过时的种籽了。
    九月下旬，该是蚕豆下种的时候了，每天都有大批大批的农民从几十里路以外赶到粮食局来购买蚕豆种，虽然仓库里堆放着大量的蚕豆，可是领导上还是不让卖。不少农民从区里介绍到县里，县里又把他们推到区里，来回跑上多少趟，可是种籽问题还是没有得到解决。当时国家规定的蚕豆牌价只有九百元一斤，但黑市已经卖到一千七百元了。秋季以来，仪征县农民不能及时补种庄稼，关键在于县人民政府不能及时供应种籽，我认为仪征县领导方面应该对这一事件进行深刻的检讨。
