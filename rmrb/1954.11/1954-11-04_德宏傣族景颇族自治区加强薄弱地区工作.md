    Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Region Strengthens Work in Weak Areas

    The Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Region of Yunnan Province is strengthening work in weak areas to gradually change the uneven development of work in various parts of the autonomous region.

    Due to the vast area and small number of cadres in various parts of the autonomous region, the work development is uneven. By the end of June this year, about half of the townships in the region still lacked systematic and regular work, and basic-level political power had not yet been fully established. Since July this year, the local party and government leading organs have strengthened the work in these areas. Various counties have held representative conferences and cadre meetings to exchange work experience and decided to train 2,900 activists and key members of various ethnic groups in rural areas in rotation this year. About 600 people have completed the training and have actively participated in various local works after returning to their townships. Luxi, Yingjiang, and Ruili counties have all transferred cadres from areas with better work foundations and stronger cadre forces to work in weaker areas. In the second half of this year, more than a dozen townships with weak work are approaching the level of advanced townships in the area, 14 townships in the Dai area have established basic-level political power, and the work in the mountainous areas inhabited by the Jingpo and other ethnic groups is also gradually strengthening.

    德宏傣族景颇族自治区加强薄弱地区工作
    云南省德宏傣族景颇族自治区加强薄弱地区的工作，逐步改变自治区各地工作发展不平衡的状况。
    自治区各地因地区辽阔、干部不多，工作发展不平衡。到今年六月底，全区还有一半左右的乡缺乏系统和经常的工作，基层政权还没有全部建立。当地党政领导机关从今年七月起，加强这些地区的工作。各县分别召开了各种代表会议和干部会议，交流工作经验，并决定在今年内轮训农村各民族的积极分子和骨干分子两千九百人。现在已训练结束的约六百人，他们回到本乡后积极参加了当地各种工作。潞西、盈江和瑞丽等县都从工作基础较好、干部力量较强的地区，抽出干部到薄弱地区工作。今年下半年，已有十几个工作薄弱的乡接近当地先进乡的水平，傣族地区有十四个乡建立了基层政权，景颇等族居住的山区工作也在逐步加强。  （新华社）
