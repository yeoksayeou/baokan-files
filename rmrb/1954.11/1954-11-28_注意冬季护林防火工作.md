    Pay Attention to Winter Forest Fire Prevention
      (I) To the Editor:
    Winter is an important season for forest fire prevention.
    Since October, some areas in Hunan Province have neglected forest fire prevention work, causing great losses to the state. According to incomplete statistics from Dao County, Yongming County, Dongkou County, Chaling County, Yizhang County, Hengshan County, Dong'an County, and others, a total of 42 forest fires occurred, burning 90,000 mu of forest area, destroying more than 970,000 Chinese fir and pine trees, more than 94,000 oil tea and tung oil trees, and more than 40,000 other miscellaneous trees. For example, in Dao County, five forest fires occurred successively in the third, fourth, sixth, seventh, and eighth districts. The most serious was a major fire in Mao'ershan Township in the seventh district on October 20, which spread from Dao County to Yongming and Guanyang County in Guangxi, burning about a hundred li of forest. In Dao County alone, the tung oil trees burned could have produced 4,500 jin of oil, in addition to more than 100,000 Chinese fir trees and countless oil tea, pine, and miscellaneous trees.
    Most of the forest fires were caused by farmers' carelessness when burning field ridges, collecting fertilizer, walking at night with torches, or burning lime. The forest fire in Changcun Township, Yizhang County, was caused by Li Shangqi, a farmer in the township, burning field ridges; the fire in Mao'ershan, Dao County, was started by Li Fuzhen, a farmer, smoking; the forest fire in Sanlong Township, Dongkou County, was caused by farmers Yuan Ziquan and Yin Zuoliang burning thatch to prevent wild boars.
    After the forest fires occurred, the local special district, county, and some district and township leading organs generally took emergency measures to put them out in time. For example, after the fire in Mao'ershan, Dao County, Comrade Shi Xiuhua, deputy secretary of the county party committee and county head, personally led nearly a hundred cadres to the scene overnight to mobilize more than 2,000 people from nearby townships to put out the fire. The Xiangtan Special Commissioner's Office and Dongkou and other places also issued circulars and announcements to promote forest fire prevention work. However, leading organs and cadres below the district level generally did not pay enough attention. After forest fires occurred in Chaling, Yongming, and other places, district and township leading organs mostly did not intervene, or only sent individual cadres to handle them, and only took action to fight the fire after the fire spread and expanded, after being urgently urged by county-level organs. Most noteworthy is that some agricultural and forestry work cadres even adopted an extremely irresponsible attitude towards fire prevention work. When a forest fire occurred in Shashi Township, Yizhang County, Kuang Shengxun, a cadre from the county agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy bureau working in this township, neither mobilized the masses to fight the fire, nor asked the higher authorities for instructions on how to deal with it (there was a telephone to the district), allowing the fire to spread without taking any action. This is extremely wrong.
    The losses caused by forest fires not only affect the supply of timber for industrial use and the guarantee of farmland water conservancy, but also affect the production and life of the people. In order to protect the state's valuable resources and the people's property, it is necessary to educate district and township cadres and the people to do a good job in forest fire prevention. First of all, it is necessary to seize the opportunity to combine various tasks to strengthen the education of district and township cadres, so that they clearly recognize the relationship between protecting forests and the socialist construction of the motherland, and then through them to educate farmers on forest fire prevention, and lead farmers to formulate necessary systems and establish certain organizations to do a good job in forest fire prevention, so as to avoid the continued occurrence of forest fires.　Nan Lin, Changsha, Hunan
      (II) To the Editor:
    Some places in Heilongjiang Province are doing a very poor job in forest fire prevention. In the spring of this year, Hulin County suffered huge losses to state property due to forest fires. The county head, forestry section chief, and relevant personnel have all been punished. However, the cadres and masses of Hulin County have not learned from this painful lesson, and there is still a widespread sense of complacency. Some even said: "There has been a lot of rain and the ground is wet this autumn, so it is not easy to start a fire." Therefore, since autumn, the behavior of making fires in the wild still occurs constantly. For example, in Xinle Village, Pingyuan Village, and Xinglong Village in the second district, some farmers still go to the fields with fire to smoke. The fire prevention organization is also incomplete, and most of the guard posts in the villages are just formalities. The fire prevention boundaries between districts and villages have not been clearly delineated. The state-owned Hongxing Machinery Farm, located in the forest area, burned 250 hectares of wasteland in the name of burning wheat straw on October 18, despite windy conditions and in violation of superior regulations. As a result, the fire spread and burned 1,388 protective forest trees of elm, poplar, and walnut, 2 to 8 centimeters thick, 40 bunches of willow branches, and 1,200 bundles of firewood for the masses.
    These situations all show that the leadership in these places has not regarded forest fire prevention as an important political task of the current forest area, and therefore has adopted a perfunctory and irresponsible attitude, failing to educate the masses and cadres to pay attention to forest fire prevention work, resulting in continuous fires and causing losses to state property. This is very harmful and should be corrected immediately.  Heilongjiang Provincial Forestry Department.

### 注意冬季护林防火工作

    注意冬季护林防火工作
      （一）编辑同志：
    冬天，正是山林防火的重要季节。
    十月份以来，湖南省少数地区由于忽视了山林防火工作，给国家造成很大的损失。据道县、永明、洞口、茶陵、宜章、衡山、东安等县不完全统计，共发生了山火四十二次，烧毁山林面积九万亩，烧毁杉、松树木九十七万多株，油茶、油桐九万四千多株，其他杂木四万多株。如道县连续在三、四、六、七、八区发生山火五起，其中最严重的是第七区猫儿山乡十月二十日的一场大火，一直由道县蔓延到永明和广西灌阳县境，烧毁山林约百多里。仅道县境内烧去的油桐树就可以榨四千五百斤油，另外还烧去杉木林十多万株和无数的油茶、松树、杂木。
    山火的所以发生，多半是由于农民在烧田坎、积肥、走夜路打火把、烧石灰时麻痹大意而引起的。宜章县长村乡的山火，是这个乡的农民李上期烧田坎引起的；道县猫儿山的火灾，是农民李富震吸烟烧起的；洞口县三龙乡的山火，是农民袁子全、尹祚良为防野猪烧茅山而引起的。
    山火发生后，当地专区、县和部分区、乡领导机关一般都采取了紧急措施及时扑灭。如道县猫儿山的火灾发生后，县委副书记兼县长石秀华同志曾亲自率领近百干部，星夜赶往出事地点发动附近几个乡的两千多群众扑灭。湘潭专署和洞口等地也曾发出了通报和布告，推动护林防火工作。但一般区级以下的领导机关和干部却很不重视。茶陵、永明等地的山火发生后，区、乡领导机关大多没有过问，或者只派个别干部去处理，直到火灾蔓延扩大，经县级机关紧急催促，才行动起来打火。最值得注意的是，有些农林工作干部竟对防火工作采取极不负责的态度，宜章县沙市乡发生山火时，在这个乡工作的县农林水利局干部邝声勋，既不发动群众打火，又不向上级请示处理（有电话通区），一任山火蔓延，而无动于中，这是极其错误的。
    山林火灾所造成的损失，不仅影响到工业用材的供应和农田水利的保障，而且影响到人民群众的生产和生活，为了保护国家宝贵的资源，保护人民的财产，必须教育区、乡干部和人民群众做好护林防火工作。首先必须抓紧时机结合各种工作，加强对区、乡干部的教育，使他们明确认识到保护森林和祖国社会主义建设的关系，再通过他们对农民进行护林防火的教育，并领导农民订出必要的制度和建立一定的组织，做好护林防火工作，以免山火的继续发生。　湖南长沙　楠林
      （二）编辑同志：
    黑龙江省有些地方的护林防火工作做得很差。虎林县今春就曾因森林火灾造成国家财富的巨大损失，县长、林业科长和有关人员都受过处分。但是，虎林县的干部和群众并没有接受这一沉痛教训，仍然普遍地存在着麻痹思想。有的甚至说：
  “今秋雨多地湿不易起火。”因此，秋季以来，野外弄火的行为仍然不断发生。如第二区新乐村、平原村、兴隆村还有农民带火下地吸烟。防火的组织机构也不健全，各村岗哨大多流于形式。区、村的防火界线也没有划清。位于林区的国营红星机械农场，十月十八日竟在有风的情况下，不遵守上级规定，用烧麦秸为名，烧荒二百五十垧；结果火势蔓延烧去二至八公分粗的榆、杨、胡桃等保安林一千三百八十八株，柳条四十撮，群众的柴草一千二百捆。
    这些情况都说明了这些地方的领导方面还没有把护林防火当成林区当前的一个重要政治任务，因此采取了马马虎虎不负责任的态度，没有教育群众和干部重视护林防火工作，以致接连发生火灾，造成国家财富的损失。这是非常有害的。应该立即改正。  黑龙江省林业厅
