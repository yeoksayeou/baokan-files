    Xingshan Mine of Hegang Mining Bureau Completes Annual Production Plan Ahead of Schedule
    Based on the monthly and balanced completion of the state plan, the Xingshan Coal Mine of the state-owned Hegang Mining Bureau completed its annual raw coal production plan fifty-three days ahead of schedule on November 8. The attendance rate reached 91 percent, and the quality, recovery rate, and labor productivity all met or exceeded the state plan targets. Personal accidents decreased by 33 percent compared to last year, saving the state 3 billion yuan.
    After studying the general task of the state during the transition period, all employees of the Xingshan Mine had even higher labor enthusiasm and actively participated in labor competitions. They earnestly promoted advanced coal mining methods such as artificial temporary roofs, full-height extraction in one pass, and hydraulic sand filling. The recovery rate increased by 21 percent compared to last year, and the mining and tunneling efficiency increased by 3.8 percent compared to last year. All employees of the mine put forward a total of 605 rationalization proposals, of which 437 have been adopted. Due to the development of the technical innovation movement, the degree of mechanization has significantly improved. For example, No. 2 well created an automatic safety gate for the transportation roadway, No. 1 well created a small coal loading machine, and No. 3 well automated the rolling cage, all of which improved production efficiency and ensured safe production.
    Now, the Xingshan Mine has formulated a production increase and saving plan to increase raw coal production by 110,000 tons and save 4.2 billion yuan by the end of the year. All employees are working hard to complete the new plan. (Guo Shishen, Li Jinhui)

    鹤岗矿务局兴山矿提前完成全年生产计划
    国营鹤岗矿务局兴山煤矿在逐月均衡地完成国家计划的基础上，在十一月八日提前五十三天完成了全年原煤生产计划，出勤率达到百分之九十一，质量、回采率、劳动生产率，也都完成或超额完成国家计划指标，人身事故比去年减少百分之三十三，并给国家节约三十亿元。
    兴山矿全体职工经过国家在过渡时期总任务的学习，劳动情绪更加高涨，积极参加劳动竞赛，认真推广了人工假顶、一次采全高、水沙充填等先进采煤方法，回采率比去年提高百分之二十一，采掘效率比去年提高了百分之三点八。全矿职工共提出合理化建议六百零五件，已被采纳的有四百三十七件。由于技术革新运动的开展，使机械化程度有显著提高；如二号井创造了运输道自动安全闸，一号井创造了小型装煤机，三号井使滚笼自动化，都提高了生产效率，并保证了安全生产。
    现在兴山矿又订出到年底增产原煤十一万吨、节约四十二亿元的增产节约计划。全体职工正为完成新的计划而努力。（郭市申　李金惠）
