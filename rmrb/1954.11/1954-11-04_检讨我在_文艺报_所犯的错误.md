    Self-Criticism of My Mistakes in "Literary Gazette"
    Feng Xuefeng
    In the "People's Daily" on October 28th, Comrade Yuan Shuipai severely criticized the "Literary Gazette" for the erroneous attitude it adopted in the discussion of the research on "Dream of the Red Chamber." This criticism is entirely correct and completely exposes the essence and seriousness of this error of the "Literary Gazette."
    I am fully responsible for this error because I am the editor-in-chief of the "Literary Gazette," and I wrote the erroneous editor's note.
    My mistake was not accidental. I have always failed to pay attention to the fact that the Hu Shi-faction's bourgeois idealism has long dominated the field of classical literature research, and therefore I have never recognized this fact and its seriousness. Even today, the Hu Shi-faction's bourgeois idealist viewpoints are still rampant and developing in the field of classical literature research, hindering the development and victory of Marxist-Leninist viewpoints and methods in classical literature research—a phenomenon I completely failed to recognize. Regarding Yu Pingbo's works on "Dream of the Red Chamber" research, I simply regarded them as some textual research and completely failed to pay attention to the bourgeois idealist viewpoints propagated therein. For example, as Comrade Yuan Shuipai has already pointed out, in the "New Books" column of the ninth issue of the "Literary Gazette" last year, there was text recommending Yu Pingbo's "Research on Dream of the Red Chamber" to readers, and when I sent it for publication, I only regarded this book as a purely textual research work.
    This fully shows that I have lost my keen sense of bourgeois erroneous ideas, paralyzed myself, and in fact become a prisoner of bourgeois erroneous ideas. It also shows that I have completely failed to recognize my responsibility in this regard, even to the point of neglecting my work and abandoning my post, because the "Literary Gazette" is a publication whose main task is to publicize and defend Marxist-Leninist literary thought and actively carry out literary criticism.
    But the seriousness of this error is by no means limited to this; at the same time, the emergence of this error also has its own ideological roots. The seriousness of the problem lies not only in my daily indifference to the rampant phenomenon of bourgeois idealist viewpoints in the field of classical literature research, but more seriously in the fact that when Comrades Li Xifan and Lan Ling opened fire on idealism in the field of classical literature research, I still did not realize the great significance of this opening of fire, thus belittling the importance of Li and Lan's articles, and at the same time belittling the vigorous fighting spirit and sharpness of their articles, and belittling this new force of Marxism-Leninism. What is the most profound reason for this error? Upon inspection, there is indeed a deep connection with bourgeois ideology in the foundation of my work style and thought. I am infected with some vulgar work styles of bourgeois writers, lack the fighting spirit of Marxism-Leninism, and am usually content with a state of no struggle, and thus am willing to "peacefully coexist" with bourgeois idealism on the ideological front. What is particularly serious is that I have been detached from the masses for a long time, lost my fresh feeling for new things, and indeed do not pay enough attention to the new forces on the literary front, and have a tendency to despise them. Of course, I have done some work to help young people in the past, such as looking at their manuscripts and trying to get their works published. But even so, I can still unconsciously harbor a consciousness of despising new forces in my heart. When I received severe criticism for despising new forces, I was initially confused, thinking that I had done some work to help young people. But this is precisely my baggage, hindering me from understanding the essence of the problem ideologically. Now I realize that the tendency to neglect and despise new forces has its own ideological basis. This kind of neglect and contempt for new forces is the most erroneous thought, and is most contrary to the spirit of Marxism-Leninism. This also most profoundly illustrates that my work style and thought are connected with the decadent ideas of the bourgeoisie. As the editor of a literary publication, how can I not commit serious mistakes when there is a deep consciousness of neglecting and despising new forces?
    Thus, in dealing with the issue of Li and Lan's articles, my first mistake was that I did not realize that this was a serious ideological struggle between Marxism-Leninism and bourgeois idealism, which showed my surrender to bourgeois idealism. The second mistake, which was even more serious, was that I belittled the fighting significance and influence of their articles, and at the same time belittled the new forces of Marxism-Leninism—also the new forces in the literary world. As I now begin to realize the seriousness of this error, as an editor of a publication and one of the leaders of the Writers Association, I feel the great responsibility and feel a deep sense of guilt!
    In this mistake, I deeply feel that I have failed the Party and the people. This is an error of position, an anti-Marxist-Leninist error, which is intolerable.
    The "People's Daily" also continued to point out in its criticism: "Many newspapers and organizations have the erroneous work style of liking 'big names,' neglecting 'small figures,' not relying on the masses, and looking down on new forces. The cultural and literary circles do not provide enough cultivation and encouragement for new writers. A few publications and critics seem to be 'authorities' that cannot be touched or criticized, as if they are always 'correct,' while many correct and fresh ideas and forces are subjected to various obstacles and suppression, and cannot emerge; if they do emerge, they will inevitably be beaten and subjected to the picky old-fashioned criticisms of being not good enough in this or that aspect." I feel that this criticism is also completely in line with the facts. My mistake of despising new forces in the "Literary Gazette" should especially attract the attention of the literary world and draw profound lessons.
    The mistake I made is also related to many errors and shortcomings in the daily work of the "Literary Gazette." Under the influence of some of my erroneous ideas and some bad work styles, many phenomena criticized by the "People's Daily" have emerged in the editorial work of the "Literary Gazette." For example: being detached from the masses, detached from reality, not listening carefully to the opinions of the masses, rarely publishing articles refuting articles in the "Literary Gazette," failing to launch free discussions, expressing bias even in occasional free discussions, as well as the editorial department's self-righteousness, subjectivism, narrow-mindedness, thinking that it is "correct," old-fashioned attitude, sense of "authority," and so on. In this way, it is inevitable that it will not be very active in supporting new forces, so that the tendency to despise new forces will gradually develop.
    Now we must be determined, under the leadership and severe criticism of the Party, to quickly and thoroughly correct our mistakes, eliminate the old work style, and make the "Literary Gazette" truly a publication with ideological and fighting spirit.
    In this mistake, my responsibility is particularly great. I fully accept the completely correct and severe criticism given to me by the Party newspaper. I am determined to correct my mistakes and transform my thinking in actual work. At the same time, I also represent the entire editorial department of the "Literary Gazette" to accept this criticism and thoroughly rectify the work of the "Literary Gazette" based on this criticism.

    Strong Road-Building Soldier Yang Haiyin Xinhua News Agency Reporter Lin Tian
    In the Chinese People's Liberation Army unit building the Kangzang Highway, there is a young soldier named Yang Haiyin. He broke his leg while building the road. After treatment and hard training, he still steadfastly stayed at his post. Although his body is disabled, his enthusiasm for building the border of the motherland continues to burn.
    Yang Haiyin has been in the Chinese People's Liberation Army for seven years. Since 1951, after the unit he belonged to arrived on the Kangzang Plateau, he has been responsible for building the Kangzang Highway. Because he has the enthusiasm to serve the Tibetan people and build the border of the motherland, he researched and created many advanced operating methods in road construction, and was rated as a Special Class Merit Citation recipient. When the troops first came to the area east of the Jinsha River from the interior, everyone was not used to working in areas with thin air, and it was difficult to master the operating techniques of various tools. Yang Haiyin was one of the fastest to master the essentials of hitting a sledgehammer. On Mount Que'er, which is more than 5,000 meters above sea level, he swung an eight-pound hammer more than a thousand times in one breath, and was praised by the soldiers as the "Hero of a Thousand Hammers." When working on the Bangda Grassland, he served as the squad leader. He helped the soldiers in his squad create the operating method of piercing the turf with a steel drill, which doubled the efficiency of digging turf. On the west bank of the Nujiang River, the troops had no experience in opening loose rocks. He learned the methods created by fraternal troops and improved them, and promoted them to the entire battalion and regiment.
    On the evening of November 9, 1953, he was working under an earth embankment more than ten meters high. The frozen soil above the embankment, which had been burned by fire, suddenly collapsed and buried him. When the soldiers rescued him from the soil, the bone of his right calf had already been broken. While asking the soldier Guo Desheng to straighten his leg, he firmly said to the comrades in the squad: Comrades! Don't be sad, I will work with you again in a few days.
    After Yang Haiyin arrived at the sanatorium, he had thought like this: I became disabled when I was young, can I still participate in border construction? But he has never forgotten the road construction work. The scene of the soldiers in the squad working hard clearly appeared in his memory. He still pondered day and night about the tricks of improving operating techniques. One day, the regiment party committee sent an organization assistant to visit him. Before leaving, he left him a book describing the volunteer female hero Zhang Daohua. After reading this book, he was moved by the heroic deeds of this girl. He thought to himself: Zhang Daohua is blind and still learns to write articles to continue working for the people, am I discouraged just because I broke a leg? The next day, he immediately wrote a letter to Regiment Commander Chai Hongquan, drew a picture of the method of hoisting stones with a winch that he had spent two or three nights thinking about, and suggested that it be adopted when the stone cliff is opened in the next project.
    Later, after he read the Soviet story and movie "A Real Man," he decided to practice walking. At the beginning, he could not walk a few steps with two crutches before falling. He continued to get up and practice again. When he found that his right foot could support some strength, he shouted happily: I can start walking. So he began to discard one crutch. After a few days, he discarded the other crutch again. He practiced walking up and down the small mountain behind the sanatorium every day. Three months later, he was finally discharged from the hospital, but his right leg was more than an inch shorter than his left leg. The regiment wanted him to return to the interior, but he repeatedly requested to continue staying in the troops. At this time, the troops were preparing to transfer the construction site. He practiced climbing steep slopes every day to prepare for the march. Although the instructor talked to him several times and asked him to continue to recuperate, he still insisted on transferring with everyone.
    After the construction started, he climbed up and down the seventeen-meter-high rope ladder like other comrades, participating in various road construction work. In the days of working in shifts day and night, he and the soldiers went down to the six-meter-deep artillery holes to swing hammers. No one could tell that he was a person who had broken his leg. His strong will inspired the labor enthusiasm of all the comrades in the company, and the squad he belonged to always maintained the honor of having the highest work efficiency in the entire company.

### 检讨我在“文艺报”所犯的错误

    检讨我在“文艺报”所犯的错误
    冯雪峰
    在十月二十八日的“人民日报”上袁水拍同志严厉地批评了“文艺报”在关于“红楼梦”研究问题的讨论中所采取的错误态度。这个批评是完全正确的，是把“文艺报”的这个错误的实质和严重性完全揭露出来了。
    这个错误完全由我负责，因为我是“文艺报”的主编，而且那个错误的编者按语是我写的。
    我犯了这个错误，不是偶然的。在古典文学研究领域内胡适派资产阶级唯心论长期地统治着的事实，我就一向不加以注意，因而我一直没有认识这个事实和它的严重性。直到今天，胡适派资产阶级唯心论的观点仍在古典文学研究领域内泛滥着、发展着，在阻碍着马克思列宁主义的观点和方法在古典文学研究上的发展和胜利，——这现象，我也完全不认识。对于俞平伯研究“红楼梦”的一些著作，我仅只简单地把它们看成是一些考据的东西，而完全不去注意其中所宣扬的资产阶级唯心论的观点。例如袁水拍同志已经指出，在去年第九期“文艺报”“新书刊”栏中，就曾经发表了向读者推荐俞平伯的“红楼梦研究”的文字，在发稿时我也只是把这本书当作单纯考据的作品的。
    这完全说明我对于资产阶级的错误思想失去了锐敏的感觉，把自己麻痹起来，事实上做了资产阶级的错误思想的俘虏。同时也说明我在这方面完全没有认识自己的责任，竟至玩忽自己的工作，离开了自己的岗位，因为“文艺报”是一个以宣传和捍卫马克思列宁主义文艺思想、积极开展文艺批评为主要任务的刊物。
    但这个错误的严重性决不止此；同时所以产生这个错误，还有我自己的思想根源。问题的严重不仅在于我平日对于在古典文学研究领域内资产阶级唯心论观点在泛滥的现象熟视无睹，问题的严重更是在于当李希凡、蓝翎两同志向古典文学研究领域唯心论开火的时候，我仍然没有认识到这开火的意义重大，因而贬低了李、蓝两同志的文章的重要性，同时也就贬低了他们文章中的生气勃勃的战斗性和尖锐性，贬低了马克思列宁主义的这种新生力量。这错误的最深刻的原因在哪里呢？检查起来，在我的作风和思想的根柢上确实是有与资产阶级思想的深刻联系的。我感染有资产阶级作家的某些庸俗作风，缺乏马克思列宁主义的战斗精神，平日安于无斗争状态，也就甘于在思想战线上与资产阶级唯心论“和平共处”。特别严重的是我长期地脱离群众，失去对于新事物的新鲜感觉，而对于文艺战线上的新生力量，确实是重视不够，并且存有轻视的倾向的。我平日当然也做过一些帮助青年的工作，例如替他们看原稿，设法把他们的作品发表或出版。但虽然如此，仍然可以不自觉地在心底里存在着轻视新生力量的意识。当我受到说我轻视新生力量的严厉批评时，我最初心里还迷惑，以为我做过一些帮助青年的工作。但这正是我的包袱，阻碍我去从思想上认识问题的本质。现在我认识到，忽视和轻视新生力量的倾向，是有我自己思想上的根据的。这种忽视和轻视新生力量是最错误的思想，是最和马克思列宁主义的精神背道而驰的。在这上面也最深刻地说明了我的作风和思想是有着和资产阶级的腐朽思想的联系的。作为一个文艺刊物的编者，存在有忽视和轻视新生力量的深刻的意识，怎么能够不犯严重的错误呢？
    这样，我在处理李、蓝文章的问题上，第一个错误是我没有认识到这是马克思列宁主义反对资产阶级唯心论的严重的思想斗争，表现了我对于资产阶级唯心论的投降。第二个错误，更严重的，是我贬低了他们文章的战斗意义和影响，同时又贬低了马克思列宁主义的新生力量——也是文艺界的新生力量。当我现在开始认识到这错误的严重性时，作为一个刊物的编者和作家协会的领导人之一，我感到责任的重大，感到深刻的犯罪感！
    在这次错误上，我深深地感到我有负于党和人民。这是立场上的错误，是反马克思列宁主义的错误，是不可容忍的。
    “人民日报”在批评中还继续指出：“许多报刊、机关有喜欢‘大名气’、忽视‘小人物’、不依靠群众、看轻新生力量的错误作风。文化界、文艺界对新作家的培养、鼓励不够，少数刊物和批评家，好像是碰不得的‘权威’，不能被批评，好像他们永远是‘正确’的，而许多正确的新鲜的思想、力量，则受到各种各样的阻拦和压制，冒不出头；万一冒出头来，也必挨打，受到这个不够那个不够的老爷式的挑剔。”我觉得这个批评也是完全合乎事实的。我在“文艺报”犯了轻视新生力量的错误，特别应该引起文艺界的注意和得出深刻的教训。
    我所犯的这个错误，也是和“文艺报”平日工作上许多错误和缺点有联系的。在我的一些错误的思想和一些不好的作风的影响下，“文艺报”的编辑工作上就产生了许多如“人民日报”所批评的现象。比如：脱离群众，脱离实际，不细心倾听群众的意见，极少发表反驳“文艺报”上的文章的文章，没有去展开自由讨论，在偶有自由讨论时也表示了偏见，以及编辑部在作风上的自以为是、主观主义、狭隘观念、认为自己“正确”、老大的态度、
  “权威”感，等等。这样，就必然不会很积极地去扶植新生力量，以致日渐养成轻视新生力量的倾向。
    现在我们必须有决心，在党的领导和严厉批评之下，来迅速地彻底地改正我们的错误，革除陈旧的作风，使“文艺报”名符其实地成为一个具有思想性与战斗性的刊物。
    这次的错误，我的责任特别重大，我完全接受党报给我的完全正确的严厉批评，我决定在实际工作中改正我的错误并改造我的思想。同时我也代表整个“文艺报”编辑部表示接受这个批评，并根据这个批评来彻底整顿“文艺报”的工作。坚强的筑路战士杨海银新华社记者　林　田
    在中国人民解放军修建康藏公路的部队里，有一个名叫杨海银的青年战士，他在修路中折断了一条腿，经过治疗和苦练后，仍然坚强地守住了他的工作岗位，他的身体虽然残废了，但他建设祖国边疆的热情继续燃烧着。
    杨海银参加中国人民解放军已经七年了。一九五一年，他所在的部队到了康藏高原以后，一直担负着修筑康藏公路的任务。由于他有着为藏族人民服务和建设祖国边疆的热情，在筑路中研究和创造了很多先进的操作方法，被评为特等功臣。部队刚从内地来到金沙江以东地区时，大家都不习惯在空气稀薄的地区施工，掌握各种工具的操作技术都很困难。杨海银却是掌握打大锤要领最快的一个，在拔海五千多公尺的雀儿山上，他抡起八磅重的铁锤一气打了一千多锤，被战士们称誉为“千锤英雄”。在邦达草原施工时，他担任着班长的职务，他帮助本班战士创造了钢钎穿草皮的操作方法，使挖草皮的工作效率提高了一倍多。在怒江西岸，部队没有开松石的经验，他学习兄弟部队创造的方法，并加以改进，推广到全营全团。
    一九五三年十一月九日的晚上，他正在一个十多公尺高的土坎下工作，土坎上面被火烧化的冻土，突然塌下来把他埋住了。当战士们把他从土里救出来的时候，右小腿的骨头已经折断了。他一面叫战士郭德生拉直他的腿，一面坚定地对班里的同志说：同志们！别难过，过几天我还会和你们一起工作的。
    杨海银到了休养所以后，曾经这样想过：年青青的就成了残废，还能参加边疆建设吗？但他却一直没有忘记修路工作，班里战士们努力干活的情景清晰地浮现在他的记忆里，他仍然日夜苦思着改进操作技术的窍门。有一天团党委派组织助理员来慰问他，临走时给他留下一本描写志愿军女英雄张道华的书。他读了这本书以后，被这个姑娘的英雄事迹感动了。他暗自想道：张道华双眼失明还学会写文章继续给人民工作，我断了一条腿就灰心了吗？第二天他马上写了一封信给团长柴洪泉，把他费了两三夜功夫想出来的辘轳吊石头的办法，画了一个图，建议下期工程开石崖时采用。
    以后，他看了苏联“真正的人”的故事和电影，决心练习走路。开始扶两根拐杖走不几步就摔倒了。他继续爬起来再练，当他发觉右脚可以支持住一些力量时，高兴得叫道：可以开步走了。于是开始丢掉一根拐杖。过了几天，又丢掉另一根。每天在休养所后面的小山上练习上下山走路，三个月以后他终于出院了，但右腿已比左腿短一寸多。团里要他回内地去，他一再请求继续留在部队。这时部队正准备转移工地，他每天都练习爬陡坡准备行军，虽然指导员几次谈话要他继续休养，他还是坚持着和大家一起转移。
    开工以后，他和其他同志一样在十七公尺高的绳梯上爬上爬下，参加各种筑路工作。昼夜轮班施工的日子里，他和战士们一起下到六公尺深的炮眼里抡锤，已经没有人能觉察到他是一个曾经断过腿的人了。他的坚强意志鼓舞了全连同志的劳动热情，他所在的班始终保持着全连工作效率最高的荣誉。
