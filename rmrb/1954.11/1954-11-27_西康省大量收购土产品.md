    Xikang Province Massively Purchases Native Products

    By the beginning of November, the state-owned trading company in Xikang Province had already exceeded the annual purchase plan by 3% for products such as fritillaria, anemarrhena, and musk. This is almost double the amount purchased during the same period last year. The types of products purchased by the Xikang Provincial State-owned Animal Husbandry Company have increased from more than 40 last year to more than 80. Among them, the purchase volume of the plateau marmot fur, a specialty of the Kangzang Plateau, increased by more than 80% in October compared to the entire previous year.

    西康省大量收购土产品
    到十一月上旬止，今年西康省国营贸易公司在省内收购的贝母、知母、麝香等产品已超过全年收购计划的百分之三，差不多等于去年同期收购的两倍。西康省国营畜产公司收购的品种由去年的四十多种增加到八十多种。其中康藏高原特产旱獭皮到十月份收购量比去年全年增加百分之八十多。
