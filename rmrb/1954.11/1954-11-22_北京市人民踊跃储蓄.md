The broad masses of citizens in Beijing are enthusiastically participating in patriotic savings to support national economic construction. As of November 10 this year, the balance of savings deposits of the city's people has reached 10.14 trillion yuan. If these deposits were used for production, they could purchase more than 4,400 medium-sized tractors or build 5.6 automated thermal power plants with a capacity of 12,000 kilowatts each.

With the development of production and the continuous improvement of people's living standards, the number of depositors in Beijing is constantly increasing. The number of depositors at the end of 1952 was more than five times that at the end of 1949, and at the end of October 1954, it was more than fourteen times that at the end of 1949. The balance of savings deposits has also increased year by year. Taking the balance of savings deposits of the city's people at the end of 1949 as 100, it increased to 8,753 at the end of 1952, and to 15,925 by November 10 this year. At the same time, the number of days for savings deposits has also increased year by year, with an average of 91 days for the savings period in 1952; 121 days in 1953; and 175 days up to the end of October 1954.

To facilitate mass savings, the Savings Department of the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China has established 24 new savings institutions and 18 mobile teams since May of this year. It has also adjusted office hours and simplified deposit and withdrawal procedures.
