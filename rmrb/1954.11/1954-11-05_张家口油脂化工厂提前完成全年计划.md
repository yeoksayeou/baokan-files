    Zhangjiakou Oil and Fat Chemical Factory Completes Annual Plan Ahead of Schedule
    The locally-run state-owned Zhangjiakou Oil and Fat Chemical Factory completed its annual output value plan 66 days ahead of schedule on October 26th and overfulfilled its profit plan by 35.22% 90 days ahead of schedule.
    The factory learned from advanced Soviet experiences and remodeled five oil presses this year, increasing production efficiency by 45% to 50%. Calculated based on the production of linseed oil, the annual increase in output value reached 16.9 billion yuan. The residual oil content of linseed cake was reduced from 6.53 jin per 100 jin of cake to about 5.3 jin, which can increase the production of 276,000 jin of linseed oil. The factory also installed augers for material selection and conveying, and augers for conveying oil cake, replacing heavy manual operations and improving labor productivity. Cooling coils were installed in the refined oil workshop to reduce the refining loss rate of linseed oil, increase oil production, and ensure cost reduction.
    The factory's employees launched a technical innovation campaign to solve key problems. For example, after the No. 1 machine button position was changed, it produced more than 17 jin of soybean oil per hour, and the residual oil content of each 100 jin of soybean cake was reduced by 0.24 jin compared to before the change. The steam pot of the No. 9 machine was changed from a single air inlet to a double air inlet, increasing the machine pressure and improving production, with the average residual oil content per 100 jin of cake reduced by 0.33 jin.
    The factory also strengthened planned management and established hourly production progress charts, thus ensuring the monthly completion and overfulfillment of plans.
    Now, all employees are enthusiastically carrying out labor competitions to ensure the early and over-fulfillment of the annual production increase and savings plan, and strive to maximize the increase in profits turned over to the state.

    张家口油脂化工厂提前完成全年计划
    地方国营张家口油脂化工厂，在十月二十六日提前六十六天完成了全年产值计划，提前九十天超额百分之三十五点二二完成了利润计划。
    该厂学习苏联先进经验，今年改装了五台榨油机，生产效率提高了百分之四十五到五十。按生产亚麻油计算，全年增产价值达一百六十九亿元。亚麻饼残油量由过去每百斤饼残油六点五三斤降低到五点三斤左右，可增产亚麻油二十七万六千斤。该厂还安装了选料和输料地绞笼，油饼输送地绞笼，代替了繁重的人工操作，提高了劳动生产率。在精炼油车间装置了冷凉盘管，降低了亚麻油精炼损失率，增产了油脂，保证了成本的降低。
    该厂职工为解决关键问题，开展了技术革新运动。如一号机钮位置更换后，每点钟多产豆油十七斤多，每百斤豆饼残油量较改换前降低零点二四斤。九号机蒸锅由单进气口改为双进气口，加大了机器压力，提高了生产，每百斤饼残油量平均降低了零点三三斤。
    该厂还加强了计划管理，建立了小时生产进度指示图表，因而保证了按月完成和超额完成计划。
    现在全体职工正热烈开展劳动竞赛，保证提前超额完成全年增产节约计划，为最大限度的增加上缴利润而努力。
