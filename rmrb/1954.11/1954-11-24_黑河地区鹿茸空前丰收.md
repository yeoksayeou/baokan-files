Heihe Region Sees Unprecedented Deer Antler Harvest

The Heihe region in northern Heilongjiang Province produced 4,500 taels of deer antler this year, approximately seven to eight times the average annual production. The densely forested Lesser Khingan Mountains are the best breeding grounds for wild animals. In recent years, the amount of deer in the area has greatly increased due to the policy of closing mountains for forestry and cultivation. This year, the People's Government organized hunters to go into the mountains to hunt, thus creating a new record in deer antler production that has never been seen before in history. Hunters have already sold 3,700 taels of deer antler to local cooperatives.

Deer antler is the nascent antler before it turns into bone and is a precious tonic in medicine.

    黑河地区鹿茸空前丰收
    黑龙江省北部的黑河地区，今年产鹿茸四千五百两，约等于历年平均产量的七、八倍。丛林密布的小兴安岭是野生动物最好的繁殖场所。几年来，由于进行封山育林使该地鹿的数量大增，今年人民政府将猎户组织起来上山打猎，因而鹿茸的生产，创造了历史上从来未有的新纪录。猎户已卖给当地合作社的鹿茸就有三千七百两。
    鹿茸就是初生尚未化为骨质的鹿角，是药类中的名贵补剂。
