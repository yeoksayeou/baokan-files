[This article reports that] Hunan Province is making rapid progress in its autumn agricultural tax collection and grain unified purchase work. As of November 7th, the amount of public grain stored in the province had reached 88.48% of the autumn tax collection target. Shaoyang Special District had completed 98.4% of its public grain storage task, and the suburbs of Hengyang City, Hengyang Special District, and Qianyang Special District had all completed more than 90% of their tasks. According to incomplete statistics from early November, the amount of grain purchased and stored throughout the province accounted for 72% of this year's purchase plan. In Xiangtan, Hengyang, and Shaoyang Special Districts, more than 1,200 townships have completed the storage of unified purchase grain.

In this year's autumn tax collection and grain unified purchase work, Hunan has further educated farmers on the general task of the state's transition period. The socialist consciousness of the farmers has continued to increase, and they are enthusiastically paying public grain and selling surplus grain. Farmers in Yonggu Township, Tenth District, Hanshou County, delivered more than 200,000 jin of public grain to the state's grain warehouses within two days. Farmers in Xianfeng Township, Changsha County, delivered more than 300,000 jin of surplus grain to the state granary in one day. Loutai Township in Xinning County, with agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams as the core, absorbed farmers to form five grain delivery teams, arranged the order and time of grain delivery, and transported it in separate teams. As a result, they completed the delivery of public grain in two days and also rushed to plant 122 mu of rapeseed, more than 90 mu of barley and wheat, and sowed 7.2 dou of oat seeds.

This year, in Hunan Province, with the exception of a few areas that suffered from floods, most areas have increased grain production. Farmers in Hengshan County have decided to sell more than 20 million jin more surplus grain to the state this year than last year. In Hengyue Township in this county, only 618 households sold surplus grain last year, but this year the number of households selling surplus grain has increased to more than 750.

    湖南省秋粮征购工作进展很快
    【本报讯】湖南省农业税秋征工作和粮食统购工作进展很快。到十一月七日止，全省入库公粮已达秋征任务的百分之八十八点四八；邵阳专区已完成公粮入库任务百分之九十八点四，衡阳市郊区、衡阳专区、黔阳专区都完成任务百分之九十以上。全省统购入库的粮食，据十一月上旬的不完全统计，已占今年收购计划的百分之七十二；湘潭、衡阳、邵阳三个专区，已经有一千二百多个乡结束了统购粮食的入库工作。
    在今年秋征和粮食统购工作中，湖南各地进一步向农民进行了国家过渡时期总任务的教育，农民们社会主义觉悟继续提高，都踊跃缴纳公粮，出卖余粮。汉寿县第十区永固乡农民在两天时间内，把二十多万斤公粮送入国家的粮食仓库。长沙县先锋乡农民一天就把三十多万斤余粮全部送入国家粮库。新宁县楼台乡以农业生产合作社和互助组为核心，吸收农民编成五个送粮小队，安排好送粮的次序和时间，分队运送，结果两天送完了公粮，还抢种了一百二十二亩油菜，九十多亩大麦、小麦，播了七斗二升燕麦种籽。
    湖南省今年除少部分遭受水灾的地区以外，大部分地区粮食都增产。衡山县农民今年决定卖给国家的余粮，比去年多二千多万斤。这个县的横岳乡去年只有六百一十八户出卖余粮，今年出卖余粮的增加到七百五十多户。
