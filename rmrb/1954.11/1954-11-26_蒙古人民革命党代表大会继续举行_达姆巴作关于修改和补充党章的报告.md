Xinhua News Agency, Ulan Bator, November 25th: The 12th Congress of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party continued its discussion on the 24th regarding the report by Tsedenbal on the directives for the development of the Second Five-Year Plan of the Mongolian People's Republic. Twenty-nine people spoke during the discussion.

At the evening session on the 24th, Damba, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, delivered a report on amending and supplementing the Party Constitution. He said that in the seven years since the 11th Congress, the life of the party organizations has undergone great changes, and rich experience in building the party has been accumulated. Some provisions of the existing Party Constitution of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party are outdated and do not meet the requirements of the current party life. The current new and major tasks of the party in socialist construction require raising the sense of responsibility of party members.

Damba then reported in detail to the Congress on the amendments and supplements to be made to the Party Constitution, and gave a detailed analysis. Damba concluded by saying: The discussion of the draft amendments to the Party Constitution, which was published two months ago, demonstrated the unity of our party's ranks. Our party is thoroughly loyal to the invincible doctrine of Marxism-Leninism and the great banner of proletarian internationalism, and there is no doubt that it will tenaciously study the historically significant experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and will develop forward as a Marxist-Leninist party.

In order to successfully complete the historical tasks decided by the 12th Congress of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, all party organizations and state organs, as well as all party members, need to carry out large-scale organizational and political work.

Therefore, the task of all party organizations is to further improve the level of organizational and political work, to consolidate the party's ranks day by day, to enhance the vanguard role of party members, and to enhance the responsibility of each party organization to strive for the construction of a socialist society in our country.

Discussion began after the report.

Delegations from the Hungarian Working People's Party and the Romanian Workers' Party congratulated the Congress. A congratulatory message from the Polish United Workers' Party was also read at the Congress.

The Congress will continue to meet on the 25th.

    蒙古人民革命党代表大会继续举行
    达姆巴作关于修改和补充党章的报告
    【新华社二十五日讯】　据塔斯社乌兰巴托二十四日讯：蒙古人民革命党第十二次代表大会二十四日继续讨论锡林迪布关于蒙古人民共和国发展第二个五年计划的指示的报告。在讨论中有二十九人发言。
    在二十四日晚间会议上，蒙古人民革命党中央委员会第一书记达姆巴作了关于修改和补充蒙古人民革命党党章的报告。他说，在十一次代表大会以来的七年中，党组织的生活有了很大的改变，积累了建设党的丰富经验。蒙古人民革命党的现有党章的一些条款已经过时，并且不符合现在党内生活的要求。目前党在社会主义建设方面新的重大任务要求提高党员的责任感。
    达姆巴接着向代表大会详细地报告了党章应作的修改和补充，并加以详细的分析。达姆巴最后说道：在两个月前公布的党章修改草案的讨论过程中，表现了我们党的队伍的团结一致。我们的党是彻底忠于马克思—列宁主义战无不胜的学说和无产阶级国际主义的伟大旗帜的，毫无疑问它将顽强地学习苏联共产党具有全世界历史意义的经验，并将作为马克思—列宁主义的党向前发展。
    为了顺利完成蒙古人民革命党第十二次代表大会所决定的历史任务，需要所有党组织和国家机关以及全体党员进行大规模的组织工作和政治工作。
    因此，所有党组织的任务就在于更加提高组织工作和政治工作的水平，使党的队伍一天比一天更加巩固，提高党员的先锋作用，提高每一个党组织为在我国建成社会主义社会而努力的责任。
    报告后开始了讨论。
    匈牙利劳动人民党和罗马尼亚工人党的代表团向大会祝贺。在大会上还宣读了波兰统一工人党的贺词。
    二十五日，代表大会将继续开会。
