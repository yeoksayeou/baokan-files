Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, November 14th: In the first week of November, Jilin Province transported nearly 20,000 tons of new grain to cities such as Shenyang and Fushun to support industrial construction and to disaster areas within the customs.

　　This year, Jilin Province purchased grain from vast rural areas. In addition to supplying the needs of people in cities, industrial and mining areas, and forestry areas within the province, and regulating food grain, seeds, and feed in rural areas, there are more than 1.3 million tons of grain that can be shipped out.

　　This year, except for the five counties in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Region which suffered from disaster and reduced production, all other counties and banners in Jilin Province had bumper harvests, providing a large amount of marketable grain. Even Changbai, Jingyu, and Fusong counties, which mainly rely on forestry and have inconvenient transportation, have a surplus of grain to supply the needs of local forestry workers, without the need for the state to transfer grain to the counties.

　　With the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, marketable grain in rural areas of Jilin Province has accounted for a large proportion in recent years. Since the state implemented unified purchase of grain last year, it has further promoted the vigorous development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement throughout the province. On the basis of increased production, the proportion of marketable grain this year has exceeded the historical level, so the amount of grain shipped out of the province has also increased compared with last year.

　　The grain shipped out of Jilin Province is mainly soybeans. The total output of soybeans this year increased by more than 2,000 tons compared with last year. In Yushu, Jiutai, Lishu, Dongfeng and other counties, which are rich in soybeans, the yield per unit area of ​​soybeans exceeded 3,000 jin, an increase of 188 jin per hectare compared with the average yield last year.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, November 13th: New cotton from Shandong Province has begun to be transported to textile factories in Qingdao, Shanghai, Tianjin and other places. The allocation plan for October has been overfulfilled. The cotton lint of this batch of new cotton is mostly above 34 British inches.

　　In order to transport the new cotton to the textile factories as early as possible, the workers in the cotton processing and transportation departments in Shandong Province have improved their work. The workers of the twelve power cotton processing factories in Dezhou Prefecture worked day and night in shifts to rush to gin the new cotton. The cotton processing factory in Yucheng County completed the processing tasks for the entire month in twenty-two days in October, and the impurity content of ginned cotton was also reduced. In addition to increasing the number of trucks for transporting cotton, the transportation departments in Dezhou, Huimin, Liaocheng and other prefectures also had a large number of horse-drawn carts participating in the transportation.

    吉林山东的新粮新棉陆续运往城市和灾区
    【新华社长春十四日电】十一月份第一周，吉林省运到沈阳、抚顺等城市支援工业建设和调到关内灾区的新粮已近两万吨。
    今年吉林省从广大农村收购的粮食，除供应省内城市、工矿区、林区人民食用和调剂农村食粮、籽种、饲料需要外，还有一百三十多万吨粮食可以外运。
    今年吉林省除延边朝鲜族自治区五县受灾减产外，其余各县、旗都是丰收，提供了大量的商品粮，甚至连交通不便以林业为主的长白、靖宇、抚松三县，也有一部分余粮供应当地林业工人的需要，不用国家再向县内调运粮食。
    随着互助合作运动的发展，吉林省近几年来农村商品粮都占很大比重。自去年国家对粮食实行统购后，更促进了全省互助合作运动的蓬勃发展。在增产的基础上，今年商品粮比重突破了历年的水平，因之运出省外的粮食也比去年增多。
    吉林省运向省外的粮食以大豆为主。今年大豆总产量比去年增加两千多吨。盛产大豆的榆树、九台、梨树、东丰等县大豆单位面积产量超过三千市斤，比去年每垧平均产量增加一百八十八市斤。
    【新华社济南十三日电】山东省的新棉开始运往青岛、上海、天津等地的纺织工厂。十月份的调拨计划已超额完成。这批新棉的棉绒多在三十四英分以上。
    为了及早地把新棉运到纺织工厂，山东省各地棉花加工和运输部门的职工们改进了工作。德州专区的十二个动力棉花加工厂的工人们，昼夜轮班赶轧新棉。禹城县棉花加工厂在十月份的二十二天中完成了全月的加工任务，皮棉的含杂率也有降低。德州、惠民、聊城等专区的运输部门，除增加汽车运棉外，并有大批马车参加运输。
