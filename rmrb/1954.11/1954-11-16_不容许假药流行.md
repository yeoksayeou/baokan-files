    No Tolerance for the Circulation of Fake Drugs

    Guaranteeing the quality of pharmaceutical production is a major matter directly related to the people's lives, safety, and physical health. However, some pharmaceutical merchants are manufacturing and selling fake drugs, or producing substandard and unqualified medicines through shoddy workmanship, treating the people's lives and health as child's play. The Shanghai *Jiefang Daily*'s report on November 5th regarding the Shanghai Municipal People's Court's sentencing of a batch of cases involving the manufacturing and selling of fake drugs, and the Tianjin *Dagong Bao*'s exposure on November 1st of the behavior of some private pharmaceutical factory capitalists in Tianjin who engage in shoddy workmanship and substitute inferior goods for quality ones, fully expose the serious nature of this problem.

    The Shanghai *Jiefang Daily*'s report on a batch of cases involving the manufacturing and selling of fake drugs revealed that many of the pharmaceutical merchants were habitual offenders who had consistently counterfeited Western medicines. For example, Ma Jusan, who colluded with personnel from the puppet police bureau to manufacture fake drugs before Liberation, was detained and educated by the People's Government after Liberation for continuing his fake drug business. However, he showed no remorse and later colluded with Zhang Shaotang, who specialized in selling fake drugs, and Shao Zhenbiao, the factory director of the private Lianhua Pharmaceutical Factory, to counterfeit more than 20,000 injections using cheap and unqualified raw materials. These injections were extremely dangerous to life, and the counterfeit morphine injections contained highly toxic substances. Ma also purchased a printing press to specifically print trademarks and advertisements for various counterfeit Western medicines. The newspaper reported that these criminals were all punished by law and sentenced to death, imprisonment, probation, or fines, respectively.

    The Tianjin *Dagong Bao*, in an article entitled "Serious Problems Existing in Tianjin's Private Pharmaceutical Factories," stated: In the second and third quarters of this year, the Tianjin Purchasing Station of the China National Pharmaceutical Company found that among the thirteen types of medicines manufactured by nine injection preparation factories, including Dalu, Berlin, and Dahan, twelve types of medicines from eight preparation factories did not meet the pharmacopeia's standards for clarity during acceptance inspection. The most common problem with these injections was the presence of small white spots, some contained glass shards, fluff, and colored spots, some had already crystallized, and some had produced sediment. Black spots and iron wires were also found in the tablets. Due to the substandard quality of the medicines, the station only completed 43 percent of its planned purchases of domestic products in the second quarter, directly affecting the supply of medicines. After this problem occurred, although the state-owned Tianjin Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory had never experienced clarity problems in the past when using the same raw materials and water sources, some capitalists still used excuses such as "the acceptance standards are too strict," poor equipment, and problems with raw materials and water quality, claiming it was a "national problem" that "cannot be solved," and refused to actively improve product quality. In July and August of this year, some private pharmaceutical factories again produced a large number of substandard medicines, resulting in returns. Some capitalists even took the opportunity to sow discord between state-owned enterprises and workers. The article, in refuting these excuses and criticizing this passive attitude towards management, pointed out that the total capital of Tianjin's private pharmaceutical factories had increased tenfold this year compared to 1951, but there had been little improvement in production equipment. For example, the production equipment of the Zhongsheng Pharmaceutical Factory accounted for one-half of the total investment in 1951, but this year it has decreased to only one-sixth, which cannot meet the needs of production development. Some capitalists even used rotten and maggot-infested raw materials to manufacture medicines that impair human bodily functions. Therefore, it is not difficult to see that some capitalists, only caring about pursuing high profits and unwilling to improve equipment, even resorting to the "five poisons," is a fundamental reason affecting the quality of medicines. And the so-called "national problem" that "cannot be solved," and the so-called "too strict" acceptance, are all deceptive tricks and a means for these capitalists to resist and undermine socialist transformation.

    These reports and exposures from the two newspapers raise the urgent issues of strengthening enterprise reform and ideological reform for private pharmaceutical factories and capitalists, and of private pharmaceutical industrialists and merchants establishing a law-abiding consciousness and actively improving their operations. This reporting plays a role in safeguarding the people's lives and health and urging the capitalists of private pharmaceutical factories and merchants to conduct legitimate business operations. At the same time, similar serious problems have occurred in other industries in other regions. Therefore, this exposure also has universal educational significance. (Zhang Wen)

    不容许假药流行
    保证药品生产的质量，是直接关系到人民生命安全和身体健康的大事。但是有些药商竟制造贩卖假药，或粗制滥造不合规定的药品，以人民的生命健康为儿戏。十一月五日上海解放日报关于上海市人民法院判处一批制造和贩卖假药案件的报道，以及十一月一日天津大公报对于天津一些私营药厂资本家粗制滥造、以劣货充好货等行为的揭露，就充分暴露了这一问题的严重性质。
    上海解放日报报道的一批制造和贩卖假药的案件中，有不少药商都是一贯伪造西药的惯犯。如在解放前勾结伪警察局人员、制造假药的马聚三，解放后因继续经营假药生意，曾被人民政府扣押教育。但他毫不悔改，后来又同专卖假药的张少棠和私营联华药厂厂长邵贞标勾结，以廉价的不合规定的原料伪造了二万多针药针。这些药针极易引起生命危险，其中伪造的吗啡针还含有剧毒。马犯并自购印刷机一部，专门印制各种伪造西药的商标和广告。报纸报道，这一批案犯都受到了法律的制裁，被分别判处死刑、徒刑、缓刑或罚金。
    天津大公报在一篇“天津私营药厂存在的严重问题”的文章中说：中国医药公司天津采购站在今年二、三季度验收交货中，仅大陆、柏林、大汉等九家注射制剂厂承制的十三种药品中，就有八家制剂厂的十二种药品的澄明度不合药典规定。这些注射液中最普遍的是有小白点，有的含有玻璃片、毛毛、色点，有的已经结晶，有的产生沉淀。片剂中也发现黑点和铁丝。由于药品的不合格，使该站第二季度国产品的购进计划只完成百分之四十三，直接影响了医药的供应。这一问题发生后，尽管国营天津化学制药厂过去使用同样的原料和水源没有出过澄明度问题，但部分资本家仍借口“验收规格太严”，设备差，原料、水质等都有问题，是“全国性问题”、“解决不了”等等，不去积极改进产品质量；今年七、八月份，又有一些私营制药厂生产了大批不合规格的药品，因而遭到退货。有些资本家甚至乘机挑拨国营企业同工人的关系。文章在驳斥这种借口和批判这种消极经营的态度时指出：天津市私营制药厂的资金总额今年比一九五一年增加了十倍，但是生产设备却很少改进。例如中生药厂的生产设备由一九五一年占投资总额的二分之一降到了今年仅占六分之一，这就不能满足生产发展的需要。有的资本家竟然用腐败生蛆的原料制造败坏人体机能的药品。因此不难看出：一些资本家只顾追求高额利润，不肯改善设备，甚至重施五毒，是影响药品质量的一个根本原因。而所谓“解决不了”的“全国性问题”，所谓验收“太严”，都是欺人之谈，是这些资本家企图抗拒和破坏社会主义改造的一种手段。
    这两个报纸的报道和揭露，向人们提出了加强对私营制药厂和资本家实行企业改造和思想改造的迫切问题，提出了私营制药工商户必须树立守法观念，积极改善经营的问题。这一报道对维护人民的生命健康，督促私营药厂药商的资本家进行正当的经营，都是有作用的。同时，类似这样的严重问题，在其他地区的其他行业中也曾发生过。因此这
  一揭露，也有着普遍的教育意义。　　（章　文）
