    发起新的竞赛提前完成第五个五年计划
    莫斯科各先进企业向全苏联职工发出号召
    【新华社莫斯科八日电】在十月革命三十七周年前夕，莫斯科各先进企业在提高劳动生产率竞赛获得胜利的基础上，又发起了提前完成第五个五年计划（一九五一—一九五五年）的竞赛。这些企业中有伊里奇工厂、国家第一球轴承制造厂、“狄纳莫”工厂、红色无产者工作母机工厂、斯大林汽车工厂、橡胶工厂、“红十月”工厂等。它们在第五个五年计划开始后的三年零九个月的时间内，已达到了计划所规定的一九五五年的生产水平，劳动生产率都迅速提高了，例如伊里奇工厂提高了百分之七十点五，国家第一球轴承制造厂提高了百分之四十七点八，“狄纳莫”工厂提高了百分之五十九。这些工厂共超额生产了约十七亿卢布的产品。在迎接十月革命节的生产竞赛中，这些工厂的职工根据实际经验，认为有提前完成五年计划总产量的可能性，于是各工厂就制订了新的计划，并发起竞赛。伊里奇工厂决定在一九五五年五月提前完成第五个五年计划所规定的总产量，提前完成一九五五年电机和日用品的生产计划，到一九五五年年底把劳动生产率比一九五○年提高百分之八十。国家第一球轴承制造厂决定要在一九五五年十月革命节以前完成第五个五年计划的生产任务，把劳动生产率比一九五○年提高百分之五十八点五，并在成本上比今年再降低百分之六点四。其他各个工厂也制订了类似的计划。现在，各工厂的职工都讨论并通过了竞赛计划。他们还号召全国职工都来参加这个竞赛。
