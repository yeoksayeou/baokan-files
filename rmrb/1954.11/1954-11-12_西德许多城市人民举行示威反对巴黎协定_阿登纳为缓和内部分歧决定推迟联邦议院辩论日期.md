Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, November 11th: According to Berlin newspapers, recently, in the major industrial centers of West Germany, the masses have been holding rallies and demonstrations against the Paris Agreement and demanding the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany.

    In Essen, on the afternoon of the 7th, several thousand people held a demonstration against the ratification of the Paris Agreement despite police interference. The masses marched forward holding banners opposing West German remilitarization and opposing the banning of the German Communist Party. The demonstrating masses were violently attacked by police using rubber truncheons, but they still held a demonstration in the square in front of the Essen train station.

    In Dortmund, more than six hundred people held a rally on the 7th despite pouring rain, protesting Adenauer's war-preparing policies and attempts to ban the German Communist Party. Schulte, the secretary of the Dortmund organization of the German Communist Party, spoke at the rally. A demonstration followed the meeting.

    More than a thousand people in Wuppertal also held a demonstration on the 7th to protest remilitarization.

    The Dusseldorf Printing and Paper Workers' Union decided at a members' meeting on the 7th to resolutely refuse to print conscription orders and other printed materials that serve the policy of rearmament.

    Xinhua News Agency, November 10th: Bonn dispatch: Adenauer decided on the 8th to postpone the West German Federal Parliament's debate on the Paris Agreement for rearming West Germany, which was originally scheduled for the 11th. It is revealed that this debate may be postponed until early December.

    Adenauer originally planned to have the Federal Parliament debate and ratify these agreements soon after the signing of the Paris Agreement. However, the opposition and dissatisfaction with the Paris Agreement among the West German people, the West German Social Democratic Party, and even many parties within the Bonn coalition government have disrupted Adenauer's plans.

    The Free Democratic Party, the Refugee Party, and the German Party, which participate in the Bonn coalition government, are dissatisfied with the Saar Agreement signed in Paris. The Free Democratic Party has repeatedly made statements criticizing the terms of the Saar Agreement. Recently, the Free Democratic Party demanded that Adenauer reopen negotiations with France on the Saar issue to conclude a supplementary protocol on the Saar Agreement; otherwise, the Free Democratic Party stated that it would refuse to support the agreement. Even within the Christian Democratic Union, twelve members of parliament do not support the Saar Agreement.

    Adenauer spoke separately with representatives of the four parties participating in the coalition government on the 4th. After the talks, the aforementioned members of the Christian Democratic Union promised "not to question the details of the Saar Agreement" when the Federal Parliament debated the Paris Agreement. However, the Refugee Party and the German Party rejected Adenauer's "persuasion," and the Free Democratic Party also did not accept Adenauer's views on the Saar Agreement. Adenauer is worried that this situation will bring great difficulties to the debate in the Federal Parliament, and it may threaten the rapid ratification of the Paris Agreement in the Federal Parliament. Therefore, Adenauer decided to postpone the foreign policy debate on the Paris Agreement in the Federal Parliament in order to buy time to ease internal divisions.

    西德许多城市人民举行示威反对巴黎协定
    阿登纳为缓和内部分歧决定推迟联邦议院辩论日期
    【新华社柏林十一日电】据柏林报纸报道，最近以来，在西德的大工业中心，群众纷纷举行集会和示威游行，反对巴黎协定要求缔结对德和约。
    在埃森，七日下午有几千人不顾警察的干涉，举行了反对批准巴黎协定的示威。群众高举着反对西德重新军国主义化和反对取缔德国共产党的标语牌前进。示威群众遭到了使用橡皮短棍的警察的猛烈袭击，但是，他们仍在埃森火车站前的广场上举行了示威。
    在多特蒙德，六百多人在七日不顾倾盆大雨举行了大会，抗议阿登纳准备战争的政策和企图取缔德国共产党的做法。德国共产党多特蒙德组织书记舒尔特在大会上发了言。会后举行了游行示威。
    窝伯塔尔市一千余人也在七日举行了抗议重新军国主义化的示威游行。
    杜塞尔多夫印刷和纸张工人工会在七日举行的会员大会上作出决定，坚决拒绝印刷征召新兵的命令书和其他为重新武装的政策服务的印刷品。
   【新华社十日讯】波恩消息：阿登纳八日决定推迟原定十一日举行的西德联邦议院辩论重新武装西德的巴黎协定的日期。据透露，这次辩论可能延期到十二月初举行。
    阿登纳原来计划在巴黎协定签字之后，很快地使联邦议院辩论和批准这些协定。但是，西德人民、西德社会民主党、甚至波恩联合政府内部许多党派对巴黎协定的反对和不满，把阿登纳的计划打乱了。
    参加波恩联合政府的自由民主党、难民党、德意志党不满意在巴黎签订的萨尔协定。自由民主党曾不断发表言论，抨击萨尔协定的条款。最近，自由民主党要求阿登纳就萨尔问题和法国重开谈判，以缔结一项关于萨尔协定的补充议定书，否则，自由民主党表示将拒绝支持这个协定。甚至在基督教民主联盟内部，也有十二个议员不支持萨尔协定。
    阿登纳曾经在四日分别找参加联合政府的四个党派的代表谈话，谈话之后，基督教民主联盟的上述一部分议员答应在联邦议院辩论巴黎协定时“不质问萨尔协定的详细内容”。但是，难民党和德意志党拒绝阿登纳的“劝说”，自由民主党也不接受阿登纳的关于萨尔协定的意见。阿登纳担心，这种情况将给联邦议院的辩论带来极大困难，它可能威胁到巴黎协定在联邦议院的迅速批准。因此，阿登纳决定延期在联邦议院中举行关于巴黎协定的外交政策辩论，以争取时间来缓和内部的分歧。
