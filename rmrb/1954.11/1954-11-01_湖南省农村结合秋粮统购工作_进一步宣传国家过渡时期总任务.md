    湖南省农村结合秋粮统购工作
    进一步宣传国家过渡时期总任务
    【新华社长沙三十一日电】湖南省农村中正结合粮食的计划收购工作，又一次大规模地向广大农民宣传国家在过渡时期的总任务。到目前止，全省各县所召开的县、区扩大干部会议已经结束，这些会议都有农民代表参加。全省参加这些会议的乡村干部和农民代表共有二十多万人。
    在各县、区的扩大干部会议上，都由党和政府的负责干部总结了一年来的粮食统购统销工作，同时宣传了我国经济建设的成就，向参加会议的干部和农民代表进一步进行了国家在过渡时期总任务的教育。乡村干部和农民代表在讨论中，引用许多具体事实，说明政府采取粮食统购统销政策的正确。在邵阳专区各县的扩大干部会议上，乡村干部和农民代表根据自己的切身体验，总结出粮食的统购、统销对国家和全体人民的许多好处。常德专区各县在小组讨论会上，通过算生活账、物价账、生产收入账、私商投机剥削账和农村资本主义分子剥削账，使乡村干部和农民代表更进一步认识了国家实行粮食统购、统销政策的必要及其对支援国家工业建设、支援解放台湾的重大意义。
    各县、区的扩大干部会议结束后，参加会议的乡村干部和农民代表以及农村中的宣传员，以乡为单位向农民广泛地展开国家在过渡时期总任务的宣传。
    当广大农民又一次听到总任务的宣传后，社会主义觉悟进一步提高了，纷纷表示要把余粮卖给国家。衡南县鸡笼乡农民在十月二日到十六日半个月中便向国家出售了三十六万多斤余粮。耒阳县余庆乡农民在十九日把二十一万斤余粮卖给国家后，立即投入冬季生产。全乡农民买回了蚕豆种子、硫酸铵和作肥料用的棉枯饼，准备扩大冬种面积。广大农民群众要求加入互助组和农业生产合作社的更多了，许多互助组正要求转建成农业生产合作社。
