    Many Agricultural Cooperatives in Hunan Province Have Completed Autumn Harvest Distribution
    The 430 agricultural production cooperatives established in Hunan Province before the spring plowing this year have generally achieved bumper harvests due to the members' efforts in production reform and overcoming various natural disasters. Now, these cooperatives have carried out distribution based on increased production. In the distribution, more than 90% of households have increased their income. For example, in the eight agricultural production cooperatives in Hengshan County, 93% of households increased their income during the preliminary distribution, generally increasing grain by about 1,000 jin, with the most increasing by more than 4,700 jin.
    In areas affected by floods, different distribution methods were adopted based on the different situations of each cooperative: for cooperatives with relatively light disasters and small production reductions, distribution was generally carried out according to the original plan; for cooperatives where some fields were affected by disasters and production was reduced or lost, while some fields had bumper harvests and the yields varied greatly, land remuneration was generally reduced separately by dividing the land into different grades according to the degree of disaster suffered by the members' land; for cooperatives where the degree of disaster throughout the cooperative was not significantly different, the proportion of land dividends was uniformly reduced or land remuneration was cancelled; for cooperatives that suffered complete crop failure due to dike breaches and disasters, land remuneration and previous labor day remuneration were generally cancelled. This allowed all disaster-stricken cooperatives to carry out distribution in a relatively reasonable manner.
    To compensate for this loss, cooperatives with reduced production due to disasters are seizing the opportunity to vigorously expand the winter planting area. For example, after the autumn harvest, the Li Shouyuan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Changde County rushed to plant more than 20 mu of late rice and 56 mu of buckwheat. After the expansion of the cooperative in the autumn, more than 240 mu of rapeseed, wheat, and broad beans were planted. At present, these disaster-stricken members are confidently carrying out production for self-salvation. (Cai Deying)

    湖南省许多农业合作社秋季收获分配完毕
    湖南省在今年春耕以前建立的四百三十个农业生产合作社，由于社员们努力进行生产改革，战胜了各种自然灾害，一般都取得了丰收。现在这批社都在增产的基础上进行了分配。分配中百分之九十以上的户数都增加了收入。如衡山全县八个农业生产合作社在预分时即有百分之九十三的户增加了收入，一般能增加粮食一千斤左右，最多的可增加四千七百多斤。
    水灾地区是根据各社的不同情况，采取了不同的分配办法：如受灾较轻减产不多的社，原则上是按原订办法进行分配；部分田受灾减产或失收，部分田丰收，产量悬殊很大的社，一般根据社员土地受灾程度，将土地划片分等分别减低土地报酬；全社受灾程度悬殊不大的社，则是统一降低土地分红比例或取消土地报酬；因溃垸、遭灾全部失收的社，一般取消了土地报酬及前段所做的劳动日报酬。这样便使所有遭受灾害的社都能比较合理地进行了分配。
    受灾减产的社，为了补救这一损失，都抓紧时机努力扩大冬种面积。如常德县李寿元农业生产合作社在秋收后，抢种晚禾二十多亩，荞麦五十六亩。秋后扩社后又种油菜、小麦、蚕豆共二百四十多亩。目前这些受灾社员都满怀信心地进行生产自救。（蔡德莹）
