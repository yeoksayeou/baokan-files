    Chongqing's Five Cotton Textile Factories Saved Over 40,000 Jin of Cotton Last Month
    Jilin City Jute Bag Factory Saved Over 30,000 Jin of Ramie in Ten Months
    The six-one-one, six-one-two, Yuhua, Yuxin, and Shashi cotton textile factories in Chongqing saved a total of more than 44,000 jin of cotton in October. In October, the unit cotton consumption of each factory's main products generally decreased by 4 to 10 jin. The cotton consumption per yarn piece in Yuhua and Six-One-Two factories both dropped below the cotton consumption target of 395 jin. At the same time, the quality of cotton yarn in each factory also improved, and cotton knots and impurities generally decreased. The cotton knots and impurities in the Six-One-Two factory decreased by 20% compared to September. In addition to objective conditions such as higher raw cotton grades, normal weather, and reduced yarn breakage rates, each factory also carried out pre-treatment of cotton blending, and adopted pre-treatment methods for raw cotton with high impurity content. In addition, the "Xiao Shi'an Segmented Lap Forming Method" was promoted in the opening and cleaning workshop of the Yuhua Textile Factory, which greatly reduced the amount of lap waste. The roving workshop of the Shashi Yarn Factory established a waste product registration system, reducing defective yarn by two-thirds. Now, the workers of each factory are actively carrying out labor competitions to save more raw cotton under the premise of ensuring quality.

    The Jilin City Jute Bag Factory has saved more than 34,000 jin of ramie in the past ten months. This ramie can be used to produce more than 14,700 additional jute bags. During the saving process, the quality of products has also been continuously improved. The first-class product rate has now reached 98.8%, exceeding the original standard.
    The Jilin City Jute Bag Factory is a small local state-owned factory. Last year, due to backward management, it wasted a lot of raw materials. This year, the factory has particularly strengthened the management of raw material usage. They have assigned special personnel to manage raw materials in the raw material warehouse and established a quota-based material requisition system, changing the past chaotic phenomenon of "requisition and issue at will." In the hemp selection workshop and the softening workshop, which are most prone to waste raw materials, they have also designated special personnel to be responsible for raw material ratio and quality inspection. The factory leadership has also stipulated the raw material consumption quota for each workshop, set up a reward system, and made reducing consumption one of the main contents of the labor competition. Workers have also put forward many rationalization proposals for saving raw materials. For example, the workers in Zheng Fuji's team in the hemp selection workshop saw that the hemp ropes used to bundle raw hemp when they entered the factory were discarded casually, while new hemp ropes had to be made from raw hemp to bundle the jute bags when they left the factory, resulting in a great waste. They suggested using the hemp ropes that bundle the raw hemp to bundle the jute bags, which would save more than 8,000 jin of raw hemp a year.

    重庆五个棉纺织厂上月节约用棉四万多斤
    吉林市麻袋工厂十个月来节约洋麻三万多斤
    重庆市六一一、六一二、裕华、渝新、沙市等五个棉纺织厂十月份共节约棉花四万四千多斤。十月份各厂主要产品的单位用棉量普遍降低四市斤到十市斤。裕华、六一二两厂每件纱的用棉量都降到用棉指标三九五市斤以下。同时各厂棉纱质量也有提高，棉结杂质普遍减少。六一二厂棉结杂质比九月份减少百分之二十。降低用棉的原因除了原棉等级较高，气候正常，断头率减少等客观条件以外，各厂还进行了抄斩花的预处理工作，对含杂质较高的原棉也采取了预处理办法。此外裕华纺织厂清花车间推广了“萧世安分段上卷工作法”，退卷大大减少。沙市纱厂细纱车间建立了废品登记制度，烂纱减少三分之二。现在各厂职工正积极开展劳动竞赛，要在保证质量的前提下节约更多的原棉。

    吉林市麻袋工厂十个月来已节约洋麻三万四千多斤。用这些洋麻可以再生产一万四千七百多条麻袋。在节约中，产品质量也不断提高，现在一等品已达到百分之九十八点八，超过原来规定的标准。
    吉林市麻袋工厂是一个小型的地方国营工厂，去年曾因管理工作落后，浪费原料很多。今年这个厂特别加强原料使用的管理工作。他们在原料仓库设置专人管理原料，建立限额领料制度，改变了过去“随领随发”的混乱现象。在最容易浪费原料的选麻车间和软麻车间，也指定专人负责原料配比和检查质量的工作。工厂领导方面又规定了每个车间的原料消耗定额，定出奖励制度，并且把降低消耗量作为劳动竞赛的主要内容之一。工人们在节约原料方面也提出许多合理化建议。例如选麻车间郑福吉小组工人看到原麻进厂时捆原麻的麻绳被随便弃置，而麻袋出厂时又要重新用原麻做麻绳来捆麻袋，造成很大浪费。他们建议利用捆原麻的麻绳捆麻袋，这样一年就可节省八千多斤原麻。
