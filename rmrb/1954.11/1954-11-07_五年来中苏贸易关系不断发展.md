(Xinhua News Agency, November 6th) On the basis of mutual assistance and the sincere desire to jointly seek economic prosperity, and with the economic development of both countries, trade relations between China and the Soviet Union have continuously developed. In 1953, China's trade volume with the Soviet Union increased by 33% compared to 1952. In 1953, China's trade volume with the Soviet Union accounted for 56% of China's total foreign trade.

Over the past five years, the Soviet Union, based on China's actual needs, has exported large quantities of high-quality, uniformly specified, and low-priced machinery and raw materials to China, strongly supporting China's economic construction. The new equipment in factories and mines such as the large rolling mill and seamless steel tube plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, the Haizhou open-pit coal mine in Fuxin, the Urumqi power plant in Xinjiang, the Harbin flax textile factory, and the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant currently under construction are all supplied by the Soviet Union. At the same time, the Soviet Union also supplies China with kerosene, sugar, and other daily necessities, as well as various high-quality seeds and breeding livestock needed for agriculture and animal husbandry. The large number of agricultural machines, pesticides, and a large amount of fertilizer imported from the Soviet Union have promoted the further development of China's agriculture.

China, according to the needs of the Soviet people's daily improving lives, has been increasing the variety and quantity of goods exported to the Soviet Union year by year. The number of new products exported to the Soviet Union this year increased by more than 30 compared to 1953. China's supply of silk to the Soviet Union increased by 139.62% in 1953 compared to 1950; its supply of black tea and green tea to the Soviet Union increased by 95.5% in 1953 compared to 1950; and sheep wool increased by 81.48% in 1953 compared to 1950. Over the past five years, more than 40,000 metric tons of apples have been exported to the Soviet Union; other various means of subsistence and industrial raw materials have also appropriately met the needs of the Soviet Union.
