    General Increase in Yield of Major Grain Crops in Xikang Province
    Major grain crops in Xikang Province have generally increased in production this year. In Han areas, rice production increased by 6 to 8 percent compared to last year. In the Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Region, the production of highland barley and wheat both completed the planned 4 percent increase. In the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Region, buckwheat, potatoes, rice, and other crops also increased in production compared to last year.

    In production, farmers of all ethnic groups received strong assistance from the People's Government. The people of the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Region received more than 200,000 pieces of free iron farm tools and more than 800,000 jin of relief grain from the People's Government. This year, the People's Government of the Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Region focused on promoting new-style farm tools in counties such as Kangding, Yajiang, and Danba, and helped Tibetan farmers improve farming techniques, increasing grain production. In the mutual aid and cooperation organizations in Han areas, relatively high harvests were generally achieved this year. The ten agricultural production cooperatives in counties such as Hanyuan and Ya'an generally increased production by about 15 percent, and the average yield of rice per mu in the Liantang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Huili County reached 1,000 jin.

    西康省主要粮食作物产量普遍增加
    西康省主要粮食作物今年普遍增产。汉族地区的水稻比去年增产百分之六到百分之八，西康省藏族自治区的青稞、小麦都完成了增产百分之四的计划，凉山彝族自治区的荞麦、马铃薯和水稻等也比去年增产。
    在生产中，各族农民得到了人民政府的大力帮助。凉山彝族自治区人民，得到了人民政府发放的二十多万件无偿铁质农具和八十多万斤救济粮。西康省藏族自治区人民政府今年在康定、雅江和丹巴等县重点推广新式农具，并帮助藏族农民改进耕作技术，使粮食产量增加。在汉族地区的互助合作组织，今年都获得较高的收成。汉源、雅安等县的十个农业生产合作社，一般都增产百分之十五左右，会理县莲塘农业生产合作社水稻每亩平均产量达一千斤。  （新华社）
