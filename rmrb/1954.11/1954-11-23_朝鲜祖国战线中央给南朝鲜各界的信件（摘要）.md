    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 20th: According to the Korean Central News Agency on the 20th, the Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Unification of the Fatherland of Korea passed a letter on November 19th to members of political parties and social organizations, non-party political figures and social personalities in South Korea, urging them to work together to realize the proposals put forward by the 8th session of the Supreme People's Assembly on the peaceful settlement of the reunification of the fatherland through consultation between North and South Korea.
    The letter said that these proposals reflect the unanimous desire of the North and South Korean people who yearn for the rapid and peaceful reunification of the fatherland, and that these proposals are extremely fair and practical and fully in line with the interests of our country. The letter said that, however, Syngman Rhee and his handful of lackeys disregard these proposals and suppress the South Korean people, even preventing them from expressing the slightest opinion on this issue, let alone engaging in activities to fight for the realization of these principles. They are trying to obstruct the peaceful reunification of the fatherland by all means.
    The letter said that due to the division of our fatherland, the worries and anxieties of the North and South Korean people are deepening. The letter said that the peaceful reunification of Korea is not only the desire of the Korean people but also the demand of people all over the world who are concerned about maintaining peace, because the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue will eliminate the hotbed of a new war in the Far East and greatly ease international tensions.
    The letter said that if international disputes can be resolved by representatives of various countries through meetings and consultations—and in fact some disputes have been resolved in this way—then there is no reason why issues that are purely internal affairs of Korea, such as the peaceful reunification of Korea, further economic and cultural exchanges, travel and communication between North and South Korea, cannot be discussed and resolved openly and honestly by Koreans themselves gathering together.
    The letter said that, first of all, political parties, social organizations, and individuals in North and South Korea must contact each other to ensure that they can move freely throughout Korea in order to establish connections in various ways, and that North and South Korea can consult on the issue of unifying the fatherland. The letter emphasized that it is necessary for political parties, social organizations, and people from all walks of life in North and South Korea to establish mutual contacts from now on in order to open up avenues for reconciliation in all aspects between North and South Korea, and to prepare for the meeting of representatives from North and South Korea in Panmunjom or Kaesong in February 1955, as proposed in the appeal of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
    The letter pointed out that the Minister of Internal Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, in accordance with the instructions of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, announced in a statement on November 17th that the personal safety of people from South Korea who come to North Korea to pave the way for reconciliation between North and South Korea, as well as their freedom to conduct activities in the north, will be guaranteed.
    The letter said that we have made full preparations to receive people from South Korea who come to North Korea to inquire about or discuss any or all practical issues related to the reunification of the fatherland and economic and cultural exchanges between North and South Korea, or a series of issues related to personal life, whether they come as political parties and social organizations or as individuals. For the convenience of people coming from South Korea, representatives of a committee composed of representatives of political parties and public organizations will first be stationed in Panmunjom and Kaesong; similar representatives will be sent to designated locations later.
    The letter requests that the South Korean authorities, like the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, also be responsible for ensuring the personal safety of people visiting South Korea and their freedom of activity throughout South Korea. The letter also proposed sending representatives to discuss and negotiate on practical issues concerning the reunification of Korea and other issues.

    朝鲜祖国战线中央给南朝鲜各界的信件（摘要）
    【新华社平壤二十一日电】据朝鲜中央通讯社二十日讯：朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会在十一月十九日的会议上通过给南朝鲜各政党和社会团体的成员、无党派政界人士和社会人士的信，要求他们共同为实现最高人民会议第八届会议所提出关于南北朝鲜以协商方式和平解决祖国统一问题的建议而努力。
    信件说，这些建议反映了渴望祖国迅速和平统一的南北朝鲜人民的一致愿望，而且这些建议是极其公正和切实可行的，完全符合我们国家的利益。信件说，但是，李承晚和他的一小撮喽囉漠视这些建议，并压制南朝鲜人民，甚至不让他们对这个问题表示一点点意见，更不用说对他们为争取这些原则的实现而进行的活动了。他们企图用一切方法来阻挠祖国的和平统一。
    信件说，由于我们祖国的分裂，北朝鲜和南朝鲜人民的忧虑和不安越来越加深了。信件说，朝鲜的和平统一，不仅是朝鲜人民的愿望，而且也是关心维护和平的全世界人民的要求，因为朝鲜问题的和平解决将可消除远东新战争的温床，并将大大缓和国际紧张局势。
    信件说，如果说，国际争端可以由各国代表通过会议和协商的途径加以解决——事实上有些争端已经这样获得了解决，那么没有任何理由，像和平统一朝鲜、南北朝鲜间进一步的经济和文化交流、旅行和通信等这种纯粹是朝鲜内政方面的问题却不能由朝鲜人自己共聚一堂，来开诚布公地进行讨论和解决。
    信件说，首先，南北朝鲜的各政党、社会团体和个人之间必须互相进行联系，保证他们可以在全朝鲜自由活动以便在各种途径上建立联系，由南北朝鲜就统一祖国问题进行协商。信件强调，南北朝鲜的各政党、社会团体和社会各阶层人士有必要从现在起建立互相联系，以便为南北朝鲜在各方面进行修好开辟大道，为根据朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议的号召书所提出的在一九五五年二月在板门店或开城由南北朝鲜代表举行会议一事作好准备。
    信件指出，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内务相根据朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的指示，在十一月十七日的声明中宣布，从南朝鲜到北朝鲜来的为南北朝鲜的修好开辟道路的人士的个人安全，以及他们在北部进行活动的自由将得到保证。
    信件说，我们已作了全面的准备，预备接待为了询问或讨论有关祖国统一和南北朝鲜的经济及文化交流的任何或所有实际问题，或有关个人生活的一系列问题而从南朝鲜到北朝鲜来的人士，不管他们是以政党和社会团体身份或以个人身份来的。为了自南朝鲜来的人士行动方便起见，一个由各政党和公众团体代表组成的委员会的代表将首先驻在板门店和开城；同样的代表将被派往以后指定的地点。
    信件要求南朝鲜当局像朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内务省那样，同样负责保证访问南朝鲜的人士的人身安全和他们在南朝鲜全境的活动自由。信件并提议派遣代表就关于统一朝鲜的实际问题及其他问题进行讨论和谈判。
