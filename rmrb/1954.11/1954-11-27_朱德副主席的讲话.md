Comrade Ambassador, Comrades, Friends:

    Today is the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Mongolian People's Republic. Please allow me, on behalf of the Chinese people and the Chinese government, to extend warm congratulations to you, Comrade Ambassador, and through you to the Mongolian people and the government of the Mongolian People's Republic.

    Today, thirty years ago, was the glorious day when the Mongolian people thoroughly overthrew feudal rule and declared the founding of the Mongolian People's Republic to the world.

    Over the past thirty years, under the leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, which takes Marxism-Leninism as its guide to action, and with the help of the great Soviet Union, the Mongolian people have changed the stagnation of Mongolia for many centuries in a short historical period, and have victoriously led the country onto the road of socialist development. Now, the Mongolian People's Republic has become a strong member of the powerful peaceful democratic socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

    Mongolia's national economy has made great progress, and animal husbandry, the main sector of the republic's economy, has achieved great success. The total number of livestock in the republic has more than doubled. The productivity of livestock products has also increased. State-owned ranches and livestock production cooperatives, which are of great significance for transforming the scattered individual animal husbandry, have also been consolidated and grown. With the help of the great Soviet Union, the Mongolian People's Republic has established its own national industry and produces a large number of items to meet the needs of the people's lives. Similarly, the cultural life of the Mongolian people has also been universally improved, and the country has cultivated many scientists, artists, experts, and technicians.

    The recent 12th National Congress of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party not only summarized the major achievements of the people's revolution in the past thirty-three years, but also formulated the second five-year plan for building socialism.

    All the achievements made by the glorious Mongolian people in the cause of socialist construction have not only inspired the Chinese people, but also made valuable contributions to strengthening the peaceful democratic socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and to defending the great cause of world peace.

    The fraternal friendly relations between China and Mongolia have become increasingly close over the past five years through continuous economic cooperation and cultural exchange. I am convinced that this friendly relationship between the Chinese and Mongolian people will be further consolidated and developed in the common cause of building socialism in the future.

    Let us raise our glasses:

    To the unbreakable fraternal friendship between China and Mongolia!

    To the health of Comrade Tsedenbal, leader of the Mongolian people!

    To the strength of the world's peaceful and democratic forces headed by the Soviet Union!

    朱德副主席的讲话大使同志、各位同志、各位朋友：
    今天是蒙古人民共和国成立三十周年纪念日，请允许我代表中国人民，中国政府向您，大使同志，并通过您向蒙古人民和蒙古人民共和国政府表示热烈的祝贺。
    三十年前的今天，是蒙古人民彻底推翻封建统治，向全世界宣告蒙古人民共和国成立的光辉的日子。
    三十年来，蒙古人民在以马克思、列宁主义为行动指南的蒙古人民革命党领导下和伟大苏联帮助下，在短短的历史时期内，改变了蒙古好多世纪以来停滞不进的现象，把国家胜利地引上了社会主义的发展道路，现在蒙古人民共和国已成为以苏联为首的强大的和平民主社会主义阵营中坚强的一员。
    蒙古的国民经济已经有很大发展，共和国经济的主要部门——畜牧业已获得了极大成就。共和国的牲畜总头数已增加了一倍半。畜牧产品的生产率也提高了。对改造分散的个体畜牧业有着巨大意义的国营牧场和牧业生产合作社，也巩固地成长起来。在伟大苏联的帮助下，蒙古人民共和国已建立起自己的民族工业，并生产出大量的物品，以满足人民生活的需要。同样，蒙古人民的文化生活也普遍提高，国家并培养了许多科学家、艺术家、专家和技术人员。
    最近举行的蒙古人民革命党第十二次代表大会，不仅总结了过去三十三年来人民革命的重大成就，而且制定了建设社会主义的第二个五年计划。
    光荣的蒙古人民在社会主义建设事业中获得的一切成就，不仅鼓舞了中国人民，而且对加强以苏联为首的和平民主社会主义阵营和保卫世界和平的伟大事业，作了宝贵的贡献。
    中蒙两国兄弟般的友好关系，五年来通过不断的经济合作和文化交流，已日益密切。我深信，中蒙两国人民的这种友好关系今后将在建设社会主义的共同事业中更加巩固和发展。
    让我们举杯：
    为中蒙两国兄弟般牢不可破的友谊；
    为蒙古人民的领袖泽登巴尔总理的健康；
    为以苏联为首的世界和平民主力量的强大干杯！
