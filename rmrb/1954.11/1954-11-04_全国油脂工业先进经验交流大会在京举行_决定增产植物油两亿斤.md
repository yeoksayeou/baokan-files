Xinhua News Agency, November 3rd: The National Grease Industry Advanced Experience Exchange Conference was held in Beijing from October 25th to November 3rd. The conference proposed that the nation should increase its vegetable oil production by another 200 million jin from this year to 1955. Participating in the conference were more than 240 representatives from units such as the Ministry of Light Industry of the People's Republic of China, the Local Industry Department, the Light Industry Trade Union Working Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, relevant central departments, local industrial departments, grease companies, oil mills, and cooperatives.

The conference first analyzed the current situation of vegetable oil production and supply in the country. It was believed that national vegetable oil production had been gradually increasing in recent years. The national edible oil output in 1953 increased by 29 percent compared to 1950. However, due to the development of national economic construction and the improvement of people's material lives, the production of grease has not kept up with the increasing needs, and a situation of supply falling short of demand has emerged in the market. The conference believes that the fundamental solution to the problem of edible oil shortage lies mainly in increasing the yield of oil crops. On September 19th of this year, the former Government Administration Council issued instructions requiring all localities to mobilize farmers to increase the planting of oil crops. It is estimated that the supply of oilseeds may be solved to a certain extent after next year. However, the conference also believes that a substantial increase in oil crop production cannot be resolved in the short term. Under the current circumstances where the quantity of oilseeds is fixed, the only way to increase edible oil production is to increase the oil extraction rate from existing oilseeds. The conference presented many specific materials illustrating the serious situation of excessively low oil extraction rates in oil mills across the country. For example, peanuts, as a major oilseed, generally have an oil content of 46 to 50 percent, but the highest oil extraction rate achieved by oil mills in various regions is 46 percent, while the lowest is only about 33 percent; soybeans generally have an oil content of 16 to 17 percent, while the highest oil extraction rate achieved by oil mills in various regions is over 14 percent, while the lowest is only about 9 percent; rapeseed generally has an oil content of 40 to 45 percent, while the highest oil extraction rate achieved by oil mills in various regions is 39.5 percent, while the lowest is only about 28 percent. These statistics show that the difference between the highest and lowest oil extraction rates of various oil crops is significant, with a difference of 13 jin per hundred jin of peanuts, 5 jin for soybeans, and 11 jin for rapeseed. The conference believes that if oil mills in various regions can increase oil extraction by one to two jin per hundred jin of oilseeds based on the current oil extraction rate, they can increase vegetable oil production by 200 million jin.

After full discussion and research, the conference believes that the best way to improve the oil extraction rate of oilseeds is to improve operating techniques and vigorously promote advanced experience in the oil extraction industry, especially the improved oil extraction method by Li Chuanjiang. Experiences in various regions have proven that in oil mills that have promoted the Li Chuanjiang oil extraction method, the amount of oil remaining in the cake has decreased, and the oil extraction rate of oilseeds has greatly increased. According to a survey, after 30 local state-owned oil mills in East China promoted the Li Chuanjiang operation method, the average soybean oil extraction rate in the third quarter increased by 0.74 percent compared to the second quarter, the peanut oil extraction rate increased by an average of 3.19 percent, the rapeseed oil extraction rate increased by an average of 1.23 percent, and the cottonseed oil extraction rate increased by an average of 0.77 percent. Many oil mills equipped with automatic spiral presses have also improved their oil extraction rates due to the promotion of Li Chuanjiang's oil extraction method. For example, the oil remaining in the cake at Qingdao Oil Mill decreased from 5.93 percent to below 5 percent; the oil remaining in the sesame cake at Baotou Sesame Oil Mill decreased from 9 percent in January to 5.16 percent in July, a decrease of 3.84 percent. The conference believes that the basic principles of the oil extraction method created by Li Chuanjiang are not only suitable for pressing soybeans, but also for pressing peanuts and cottonseed; not only suitable for manual oil extraction, but also for machine oil extraction.

The conference conducted specific research on the organizational leadership issues in promoting various advanced experiences in the oil extraction industry, the processing contract issues in the grease industry, and the improvement of oil mill management, and made specific arrangements on how to implement the decisions of the conference in the future. The conference requested that while promoting various advanced experiences, oil mills in various regions must further strengthen technical management, formulate advanced technical and economic quotas and process regulations, establish and strengthen inspection and overhaul systems to ensure safe production, and pay attention to reducing costs.

During the conference, Li Chuanjiang from Siping Oil and Wine Factory in Jilin Province, who created the advanced oil extraction method, introduced to the conference the process of his creation of the oil extraction method. At the meeting, representatives from various regions also exchanged many advanced experiences in the oil extraction industry. Minister of Light Industry Jia Tuofu, Vice Minister Song Shaowen, Vice Minister of Local Industry Song Naide, and Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Lai Ruoyu, among others, also gave specific instructions to the attending representatives.

    全国油脂工业先进经验交流大会在京举行
    决定增产植物油两亿斤
    【新华社三日讯】全国油脂工业先进经验交流大会十月二十五日到十一月三日在北京举行。这次会议提出从今年到一九五五年全国要再增产植物油两万万斤。参加这次会议的，有中华人民共和国轻工业部、地方工业部、中华全国总工会轻工业工会工作委员会、中华全国供销合作总社及中央有关部门、各地工业部门、油脂公司、油厂及合作社等单位的代表共二百四十多人。
    会议首先分析了目前全国植物油的生产和供应情况。认为几年来全国植物油的生产是逐步提高的。一九五三年全国食油的产量，比一九五零年增加了百分之二十九。但是，由于国家经济建设的发展和人民物质生活的提高，油脂的生产赶不上日益增长的需要，市场上出现了供不应求的现象。会议认为：从根本上解决食油不足的问题，主要是依靠油料作物产量的提高。今年九月十九日，前政务院已发出指示，要求各地发动农民增植油料作物，估计明年以后油料的供应可能得到一定程度的解决。但会议同时认为：油料作物的大量增产，不是短时期内能够解决的。在目前油料数量固定的情况下，增加食油产量的唯一办法，就是从现有的油料中提高出油率。会议通过许多具体材料，说明各地油厂出油率过低的严重情况。例如：作为主要油料的花生仁，含油量一般在百分之四十六到百分之五十，但各地油厂出油量最高的达到百分之四十六，最低的只到百分之三十三左右；大豆的含油量一般在百分之十六到百分之十七，而各地油厂出油量最高的达到百分之十四以上，最低的只到百分之九左右；菜籽的含油量一般在百分之四十到百分之四十五，而各地油厂出油量最高的达到百分之三十九点五，最低的只到百分之二十八左右。这些统计材料说明：各种油料作物的最高出油量和最低出油量之间的差额是很大的，其中每百斤花生仁差十三斤，大豆差五斤，菜籽差十一斤。会议认为：各地油厂如果从现有出油率的基础上使每百斤油料多出油一斤到两斤，就能增产植物油两万万斤。
    会议经过充分地讨论研究，认为提高油料出油率的最好办法，就是改进操作技术，大力推广榨油工业中的先进经验，特别是推广李川江改进的榨油方法。各地经验证明，凡是推广了李川江榨油法的油厂，饼中残存的油量都有下降，油料的出油率大大提高。根据调查：华东三十个地方国营油厂推广李川江操作法后，大豆出油率第三季比第二季平均提高百分之零点七四，花生出油率第三季比第二季平均提高百分之三点一九，菜籽出油率第三季比第二季平均提高百分之一点二三，棉籽出油率第三季比第二季平均提高百分之零点七七。许多有自动螺旋机装备的油厂，由于推广李川江的榨油法，出油率也提高了。如青岛油厂饼中残存的油，由百分之五点九三降低到百分之五以下；包头胡麻油厂麻饼内残存的油，已由一月份的百分之九降低到七月份的百分之五点一六。共降低了百分之三点八四。会议认为：李川江创造的榨油法的基本原理，不仅适合于榨大豆，还适合于榨花生、棉籽；不仅适合于手工榨油，同样也适合于机器榨油。
    会议对推广榨油工业中各种先进经验的组织领导问题、油脂工业中的加工合同问题及改进油厂经营管理问题，做了具体研究，并对今后如何贯彻大会的决定做了具体安排。会议要求各地油厂在推广各种先进经验的同时，必须进一步加强技术管理，制订先进的技术经济定额、工艺规程，建立和加强检修、轮修制度，做到安全生产，并注意降低成本。
    会议进行期间，创造先进榨油法的吉林省四平油酒制造厂李川江，向大会介绍了他创造榨油法的经过。会上，各地代表还交流了榨油工业中的许多先进经验。轻工业部部长贾拓夫、副部长宋劭文，地方工业部副部长宋乃德及中华全国总工会主席赖若愚等，也向到会代表作了具体指示。
