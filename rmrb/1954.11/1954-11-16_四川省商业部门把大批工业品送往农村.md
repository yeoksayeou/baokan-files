Commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives in Sichuan Province are working closely together to send large quantities of industrial products to rural areas. The Neijiang Purchasing and Supply Station of the China Department Store allocated more than 700 tons of industrial products to grassroots sales units in Neijiang, Suining, and Leshan prefectures from September 14th to the end of October. The Pixian State-owned Department Store and the County Supply and Marketing Cooperative jointly organized a department store promotion team, transporting three carts of daily-use merchandise to Zhiru Village, where they sold more than 250 items in a single day. Yongxing Market in Xinjin County held a small-scale material exchange fair in conjunction with grain purchasing work, resulting in a more than fivefold increase in wholesale sales of daily-use merchandise. In many areas, some commodities that were previously difficult to sell became popular after publicity and exhibitions. After receiving policy education from state-owned commercial departments, many private merchants have also proposed plans to order goods and promote the sale of industrial products in the countryside.

    四川省商业部门把大批工业品送往农村
    四川省国营商业部门和供销合作社密切配合，把大批工业品源源送往农村。中国百货公司内江采购供应站从九月十四日到十月底，调拨了七百多吨工业品给内江、遂宁、乐山等专区的基层销售单位。郫县国营百货商店和县供销合作社曾经联合组织百货推销组，把三车日用百货运到指路村，在这个村里一天就卖了二百五十多件货。新津县永兴场配合购粮工作，举行了小型物资交流会，结果日用百货批发额上升了五倍多。不少地区原来有些商品不好销售，经过宣传、展览，变成了畅销货。许多私营商户经过国营商业部门进行政策教育以后，也纷纷提出要货计划，推销工业品下乡。
