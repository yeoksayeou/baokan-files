The first delegation from Heilongjiang Province to visit the Soviet Union's Exhibition of Economic and Cultural Achievements in Beijing returned to their home locations on October 30th. The members are now disseminating their experiences to the masses in various sectors throughout the province.

The first delegation organized by Heilongjiang Province consisted of 203 people, including representatives from all sectors such as workers, farmers, women, youth, government cadres, culture and art, education, and private industrialists and businessmen. During their visit to Beijing, they gained a more comprehensive understanding of the Soviet Union, which is marching towards a communist society, and their confidence in learning from the Soviet example to build a better life was further enhanced. Wang Ligong, a basic construction worker, saw the mechanical tools used by the Soviet Union in basic construction at the exhibition and said happily, "When we use those machines in the future, we won't have to worry about building any kind of factory or building! We must study culture and learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union even better." Cui De, an agricultural labor model, said after seeing various mechanical farm implements at the exhibition, "We grow flax there, and every time we pull the flax, our hands are pulled bloody. I never dreamed that this kind of delicate work could be done by machines. After seeing this, we must sell more grain to the state to develop industry, and in the future, we will use machines to farm the land like the Soviet farmers!"

After the first delegation returned, they also held group discussions to fully exchange their impressions and experiences from the visit. Now, the visiting representatives from all sectors have returned to their respective locations and are widely disseminating their experiences. Chen Huanzhi, an advanced producer at the flax factory, returned to the factory and described in detail the shape of the automatic spinning machine he saw at the exhibition to the workers in the factory. He also proposed to the administration that they should learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and add equipment such as automatic splicing machines.

    黑龙江省首批参观代表团回到原地
    向各界传达参观苏联展览会的印象和体会
    黑龙江省第一批到北京参观苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会的参观团，已经在十月三十日回到原地。团员们现在正分头向省内各界群众进行传达。
    黑龙江省组织的第一批参观团一共有二百零三人，包括工人、农民、妇女、青年、机关干部、文化艺术、教育、私营工商业等各界的代表人物。他们在北京参观当中，对正在向共产主义社会迈进的苏联有了更全面的了解，学习苏联的榜样建设美好生活的信心更加提高了。基本建设工人王立功在展览会上看到了苏联在基本建设中使用的机械工具，高兴地说：“等将来咱们也使上那些机器时，建设什么样的工厂、楼房也不用愁了！我们一定要更好好地学习文化，学习苏联先进经验。”农业劳动模范崔德在展览会上看到各种机械农具后说：“咱们那里种亚麻，一到拔麻时，两手都拔出血印来，做梦也没想到这种细活也能用机器干了。这一看哪，我们一定要多卖粮食给国家发展工业，将来好像苏联农民那样使机器种地！”
    第一批参观团回去后，又分组进行了座谈，全面地交流了参观的印象和体会。现在各界的参观代表，都已回到各地，正在广泛进行传达。亚麻厂的先进生产者陈焕芝回到工厂后，把在展览会上看见的自动纺纱机的形状详细地向厂内工人做了介绍，并向行政提出要学习苏联的先进经验，添设自动接头机器等设备。
