    More Than Fifty Households of Farmers in the Ninth District of Chengde County, Rehe Province, Who Had Grain Stored Last Year and Did Not Sell It, Realize the Benefits of Unified Purchase and Sale and Decide to Sell Grain to the State
    More than fifty households of farmers in the Ninth District of Chengde County, Rehe Province, who had grain stored last year and did not sell it, have decided to sell their grain from last year and this year's surplus grain to the state.
    Recently, these fifty-plus households of farmers participated in village meetings to summarize the benefits of unified purchase and sale of grain. At the meetings, they heard reports from farmers who sold their surplus grain to the state last year about the benefits of doing so, and they were greatly educated. Sun Tingyue, a farmer from Xiaogushan Village, said: "In the old society, prices were unstable, which made me develop the habit of 'saving grain is better than saving money.' Last year, I did not sell more than four thousand jin of my surplus grain to the state. However, since the state implemented the unified purchase and sale of grain for a year, grain prices have been very stable. My stored grain was flooded in the cellar, which caused me losses and also caused losses to the state. Now I realize that selling surplus grain to the state in a timely manner can turn dead grain into live money; at the same time, the state controls the grain, which can ensure stable grain prices, which is beneficial to national construction and also beneficial to farmers. I shouldn't have disobeyed the government last year, and this year I will definitely sell all this stored grain and this year's surplus grain to the state." Lin Yongting, a farmer from Pingfang Village, had the idea of "storing grain for famine relief" and stored three hundred jin of surplus grain last year without selling it; this year he saw that the state's grain supply was very sufficient, and now he has decided to sell three hundred jin of stored grain and more than two thousand jin of this year's surplus grain to the state. He also promoted the benefits of unified purchase and sale to five households in the village with surplus grain. Farmer Lin Fuye originally only wanted to sell four hundred jin of surplus grain, but after Lin Yongting's promotion and mobilization, he decided to sell all of his surplus grain. Lin Yongbin, another farmer from Pingfang Village, hoarded grain last year waiting for higher prices, keeping six hundred jin of surplus grain. Now he has also decided to sell his stored grain and this year's surplus grain, totaling four thousand five hundred jin, of which three thousand jin have been sent to the granary.

    热河省承德县第九区五十多户去年存粮未卖的农民
    认识到统购统销的好处决定卖粮给国家
    热河省承德县第九区有五十多户去年存粮未卖的农民，决定把去年的存粮和今年的余粮一起卖给国家。
    最近，这五十多户农民分别参加了村里召开的总结粮食统购统销的好处的座谈会。在座谈会上，他们听到去年卖粮的农民报告把余粮卖给国家的好处，受到很大教育。小孤山村农民孙廷月说：“在旧社会物价不稳定，使我养成了‘存钱不如存粮’的习惯。去年我的四千多斤余粮就没有卖给国家。可是国家实行粮食统购统销一年来，粮价很稳定，我的存粮放在地窖中反被水淹了一些，自己受了损失，也使国家受了损失。现在我认识到把余粮及时卖给国家，就能把死粮变成活钱；同时国家掌握粮食，能保证粮价稳定，对国家建设有利，对农民也有好处。我去年不该不听政府的话，今年一定把这些存粮和今年的余粮都卖给国家。”平房村农民林永廷有“储粮备荒”的思想，去年存了三百斤余粮没有卖；今年他看到国家的粮食供应很充足，现在决定把三百斤存粮和今年的两千多斤余粮都卖给国家。他还向村内五户余粮户宣传统购统销的好处。农民林福业原来只想卖四百斤余粮，经过林永廷的宣传动员，决定把余粮全部出卖。平房村另一农民林永彬去年等价惜售，留了六百斤余粮，现在他也决定把存粮和今年的余粮共四千五百斤都卖给国家，其中有三千斤已送到粮库。　（新华社）
