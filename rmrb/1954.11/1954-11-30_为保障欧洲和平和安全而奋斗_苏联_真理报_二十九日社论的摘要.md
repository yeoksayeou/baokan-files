Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 29th: The "Pravda" published an editorial on the 29th, titled "Striving to Safeguard European Peace and Security," commenting on the European countries' conference to discuss safeguarding European peace and security, scheduled to be held in Moscow on the 29th.

The editorial stated that this conference was prepared by the entire course of the development of international relations in recent years. The characteristic of this entire period is the Soviet Union's unyielding efforts to establish a European collective security.

The editorial traced back, saying that the Soviet Union has proposed suggestions for ensuring European collective security more than once, but the Western countries have stubbornly refused to take any steps to prepare for an all-European conference to establish a European collective security system. After the signing of the Paris Agreement, Western politicians, especially those in the United States, began to urge the parliaments of Western European countries to approve these agreements quickly, and some of these countries stipulated the earliest possible date for parliamentary debates on the issue of approving the Paris Agreement.

The editorial said that all of this makes the broad public more anxious, and they rightly recognize that if the Paris and London agreements are approved, the hands of the German revanchists will be completely untied. It is quite obvious that the convening of the European Security Conference can no longer be delayed. The editorial said: The governments of Western countries, some of which have already refused to attend the meeting under some pretext, and some countries, including the United States, Britain, France, and other countries in the Atlantic Group, have not yet responded to the Soviet Union's note. The leaders of these countries insist that the scheduled date for the meeting is "too tight" and they do not have time to prepare to consider the very important issues to be discussed at the meeting. At the same time, the major politicians of the United States, Britain, and France constantly say that the European conference can only be convened after the Paris Agreement is approved, although everyone is very clear that the approval of these agreements means building a military "Western European Union" with the revived German Wehrmacht as its vanguard. In this case, it would be meaningless to discuss the establishment of comprehensive European security.

The editorial said: The clumsy excuses and reservations put forward by the ruling groups of Western countries only prove that they are deliberately evading the discussion of European peace and security at this critical juncture, and want to freely implement the plan to establish a military alliance of certain European countries and armed West German revanchists, a situation that is increasing the danger of a new war. In this situation, it is absolutely natural for the peace-loving people of European countries to take new steps to safeguard their own security.

The editorial concluded that the European countries' conference is about to begin its work today. There is no doubt that in the new situation where urgent measures need to be taken to safeguard European peace and security, this conference will surely become an important milestone on the road to solving this historic task.

    为保障欧洲和平和安全而奋斗
    ——苏联“真理报”二十九日社论的摘要
    【新华社二十九日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”二十九日发表社论，题目是“为保障欧洲和平和安全而奋斗”，评论定于二十九日在莫斯科举行的讨论保障欧洲和平和安全的欧洲国家会议。
    社论说，这个会议是被近年来国际关系的整个发展过程准备好了的。整个这一时期的特点就是，苏联不屈不挠地为建立欧洲集体安全而努力。
    社论追溯说，苏联不止一次提出了保障欧洲集体安全的建议，但是西方国家一直顽固地拒绝采取任何步骤来筹备建立欧洲集体安全体系的全欧会议。在巴黎协定签字以后，西方政治家，尤其是美国的政治家，开始催促西欧国家议会赶快批准这些协定，并且使其中一些国家规定了尽可能早的日期来就批准巴黎协定问题进行议会辩论。
    社论说，所有这一切使得广大的公众更加忧虑起来，他们正确地认识到如果巴黎和伦敦协定获得批准，那就会完全解开德国复仇主义者的双手。十分明显，欧洲安全会议的召开，决不能再延搁了。社论说：西方国家的政府，有些已经在某种借口下拒绝出席会议，还有一些国家，包括美国、英国、法国和大西洋集团其他国家在内，到现在还没有答复苏联照会。这些国家的领袖硬说举行会议的预定日期“太紧迫”，他们没有时间来准备考虑会议将要讨论的各项极其重要的问题。同时，美国、英国和法国的主要政治家们不断地说，只有在巴黎协定得到批准以后，才能召开欧洲会议，虽然人人都很清楚，这些协定的批准就是意味着建成一个以复活的德国国防军为急先锋的侵略性的“西欧联盟”。在这种情况下，讨论建立欧洲全面安全会是没有意义的。
    社论说：西方国家统治集团提出的笨拙的借口和保留条件只是证明他们存心规避在这个紧要关头讨论欧洲和平和安全的问题，并且想要放手地实现建立某些欧洲国家和武装起来的西德复仇主义者的军事联盟的计划，这种情况正在增加新战争的危险。在这种情势下，爱好和平的欧洲各国人民不得不采取新的步骤来保障自己的安全，那是绝对自然的事。
    社论最后说，欧洲国家会议要在今天开始工作了。毫无疑问，在需要采取紧急措施来保障欧洲和平和安全的新的情况下，这次会议一定会成为通往解决这个历史性任务的道路上的重要里程碑。
