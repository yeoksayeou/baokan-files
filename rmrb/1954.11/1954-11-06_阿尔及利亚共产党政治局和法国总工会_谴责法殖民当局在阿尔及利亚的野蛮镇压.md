Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 5th. "L'Humanité" published a statement by the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Algerian Communist Party. The statement said: The peasant uprising in the Aurès Mountains is the result of the French ruling group's policy of national oppression and suppression of freedom, as well as its policy of poverty, unemployment, and exploitation of the Algerian working people.

The Politburo said: Bloodshed can only be stopped by meeting the just demands of Algerian patriots.

The Algerian Communist Party calls on all patriots to unite and strive for an immediate end to the suppression measures being implemented in Algeria; to strive for the release of those arrested and the implementation of new policies that meet the just demands of the Algerian people.

The French government's colonial policy in Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco has been resolutely condemned by French democratic public opinion.

The French General Confederation of Labor issued a public statement expressing its support for the fundamental demands of the Algerian people. The French General Confederation of Labor opposes colonial suppression measures that can only exacerbate the situation in Algeria; and emphasizes that the only way to solve the Algerian problem is to satisfy the legitimate demands of the Algerian working people who are fighting for freedom and national independence of their homeland.

French Communist Party member of parliament Élise Spotti said in the National Assembly on the 3rd: Strengthening suppression, sending troops and the "Republican Security Force" there cannot solve the Algerian problem. In Algeria, as in Tunisia and Morocco, the problem lies in recognizing the people's desire to abolish the colonial system.

    阿尔及利亚共产党政治局和法国总工会
    谴责法殖民当局在阿尔及利亚的野蛮镇压
    【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社巴黎四日讯：“人道报”刊载了阿尔及利亚共产党中央委员会政治局的声明。声明说：阿勒斯山区农民暴动事件，是法国统治集团执行民族压迫和镇压自由的政策以及执行贫困、失业和剥削阿尔及利亚劳动人民的政策的结果。
    政治局说：只有在满足阿尔及利亚爱国志士的正义要求的基础上才能停止流血。
    阿尔及利亚共产党号召全体爱国者联合起来，争取立刻终止在阿尔及利亚施行的镇压措施；争取释放被捕者并执行符合阿尔及利亚人民的正义要求的新政策。
    法国政府在阿尔及利亚、突尼斯和摩洛哥执行的殖民政策遭到法国民主舆论的坚决谴责。
    法国总工会发表公报，表示支持阿尔及利亚人民的基本要求。法国总工会反对采取只能使阿尔及利亚局势尖锐化的殖民镇压措施；并强调指出，解决阿尔及利亚问题的唯一办法是满足为争取自由和祖国民族独立而斗争的阿尔及利亚劳动人民的合法要求。
    法国共产党议员艾利斯·斯波蒂斯三日在国民议会中说：加强镇压，派遣军队和“共和国保安队”到那里去，是不能解决阿尔及利亚问题的。在阿尔及利亚和在突尼斯和摩洛哥一样，问题在于承认人民要求废除殖民制度的愿望。
