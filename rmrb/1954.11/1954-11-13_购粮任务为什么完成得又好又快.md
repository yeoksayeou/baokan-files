Why the Grain Procurement Task Was Completed So Well and So Quickly
By Our Reporter Tian Liu

    July is a very busy season in the countryside. The wheat is ripe and needs to be harvested; the wheat fields need to be plowed; the cotton needs to be topped and pruned; tall plants need to be cut and green manure needs to be pressed; to ensure a bumper autumn harvest, all crops must be weeded, seedlings separated, seedlings protected, and fertilized...

    This July was an even busier season for rural cadres. They had to publicize and lead the masses in discussing the draft constitution; conduct grass-roots elections and hold people's congresses at all levels; rectify, consolidate, and improve mutual aid teams and agricultural producers' cooperatives; prepare for the enrollment of primary school graduates and their participation in production; complete the summer collection of agricultural taxes; ...and also complete the unified purchase of wheat in this busy season for both the masses and the cadres, a busy season for production and for work.

    The Yuncheng Special District [Note 1] in Shanxi Province completed and overfulfilled this huge unified grain purchase task.

    The Yuncheng Special District is located in the southern part of Shanxi Province. The Yellow River surrounds it from the west and south. It includes thirteen counties, including Yongji, Pinglu, and Jieyu. It faces the Guanzhong region of Shaanxi Province across the river. This special district is the most affluent area in Shanxi Province, rich in wheat and cotton. All land except for cotton cultivation is about 90 percent planted with wheat. Therefore, grain purchase after the wheat harvest is the unified purchase of grain for the whole year. Completing the summer grain purchase task means completing the grain purchase task for the whole year.

    This year, the Yuncheng Special District completed the unified grain purchase task very quickly. From late June to the end of July, not only was the grain "bought out from the hands of the farmers," but it had also been successfully put into storage. The task was completed quickly—not because the cadres forced it to be quick through coercion and commandism. This can be clearly seen from the enthusiastic scene of the vast number of farmers actively selling grain and from the further increase in farmers' enthusiasm for production after selling grain. The grain purchase task in Yuncheng Special District was carried out simultaneously with the summer collection of agricultural taxes, exceeding the quota by more than 11 million catties, and the summer tax collection and unified purchase tasks were completed together. Overfulfilling the task—not because the farmers sold their own rations. On the contrary, the farmers still had surplus grain in their hands after the grain purchase. The best proof is that the state purchased more than 7 million catties of grain in the primary grain market in July, August, and September alone [Note 2]. The task was completed well and quickly—not because the cadres in Yuncheng Special District put aside other work and other tasks and only did the grain purchase. No. While working on the grain purchase, they ensured that more than 80 percent of the masses received constitutional education; successfully held county people's congresses; increased the number of agricultural producers' cooperatives from 195 to 978; supply and marketing cooperatives and credit cooperatives were also further developed, with almost every township having a supply and marketing cooperative and a credit cooperative; and promoted a new upsurge in the patriotic increase production movement and the socialist transformation of agriculture...

    It was completed quickly and well. How was this work done? What good experiences were there?

    Last year, the grain purchase work in Yuncheng Special District, Shanxi Province, was carried out using the method of "political mobilization and democratic appraisal." At that time, this was a feasible and correct method. However, along with this method, some shortcomings and deviations also arose in the grain purchase work: advanced farmers and activists in the countryside actively sold their surplus grain, even selling it all, leaving nothing for themselves; another part of the farmers sold very little or even did not sell their surplus grain; coupled with the short period of time and incomplete understanding of the situation, there were also phenomena of being too lenient or too harsh in the appraisal. If the farmers sold all their grain or the appraisal was too harsh, it would affect the farmers' lives and enthusiasm for production; if the farmers did not sell the surplus grain they should have sold or the appraisal was too lenient, the state's task of unified grain purchase would not be completed, affecting national construction.

    Based on this situation and the new changes in the rural economy after the implementation of the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party believed that this year, conditions were already in place to gradually regularize the unified grain purchase work and avoid the shortcomings and deviations that occurred last year, so as to better implement the state's policy of unified purchase and sale of grain. After careful research, the Provincial Finance Committee drafted a unified purchase method of "calculating surplus grain by referring to the standard mu for agricultural tax."

    The system of collecting agricultural tax (farmers call it "public grain") has been implemented in most areas of Shanxi Province for more than ten years, and even in late-liberation areas like Yuncheng Special District, it has been in place for four or five years. The masses are very familiar with it. The agricultural tax itself has been relatively fair and reasonable after years of investigation, revision, and improvement. Applying the experience of collecting agricultural tax to the unified grain purchase work can, first, adapt to the habits of the masses, second, achieve fairness and reasonableness, and third, encourage farmers' production enthusiasm and labor enthusiasm like the agricultural tax. When drafting this grain purchase method, the Provincial Finance Committee referred to the principle of calculating the "standard mu" for agricultural tax, determined the "tax exemption point" based on the consumption level of farmers in the province, and followed the central government's policy of purchasing more from those with more surplus grain, less from those with less, and not purchasing from those with no surplus grain, and leaving some surplus grain for the farmers, determined the "unified purchase rate" of 70 to 90 percent of the surplus grain (the rich peasants can have up to 95 percent of their surplus grain purchased). During the unified purchase, the farmer's land is converted into standard mu based on the expected yield [Note 3]. From the total number of standard mu (i.e., the total expected yield), the agricultural tax, the population's rations, the livestock's (including pigs) feed, and the land's seeds are deducted. What is left is the farmer's surplus grain number for this year; then, multiply by the unified purchase rate, and that is the amount of surplus grain that should be sold to the state.

    The method of grain purchase was in place, but this was, after all, a new task. The cadres lacked mature experience, and the busy production, many tasks, and heavy workload in July further increased the complexity of the work. To do this work well, the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, on the one hand, required all localities to "mobilize the whole Party and go all out," and in terms of work deployment, to closely integrate all tasks and do them well simultaneously, "with production as the center, grain purchase as the focus, and the Constitution as the driving force"; on the other hand, it transferred a large number of cadres to various localities to inspect and help with the work. More than 200 cadres were sent to the Yuncheng Special District alone. Under the direct help of the provincial Party committee working group, the counties in Yuncheng Special District universally convened three-level cadre meetings at the county, district, and township levels, and mobilized and organized more than 4,700 people to form many working groups to directly go into the countryside to help rural cadres carry out their work. Before officially starting the unified purchase work, each county conducted investigations and pilot projects in typical townships to determine the "standard mu," "expected yield," and "unified purchase rate"—this was very important. Otherwise, how many standard mu should be deducted per person as a "tax exemption point" to be appropriate? Under the specific circumstances of the county, should the "unified purchase rate" be 70 percent, 80 percent, or 90 percent? In the pilot project, each county solved these problems, and based on the different situations of production development, divided the county into several economic zones, determined different tax exemption points, unified purchase rates, and livestock feed and seed deduction standards for different economic zones.

    After the summer harvest, farmers knew from their experience that the state would definitely carry out the unified purchase of grain, but how would it be purchased, and how much would be purchased? They did not know. Would it be like last winter, "without any rules"?—The masses had concerns about last year's grain purchase method. When the cadres announced this year's grain purchase method to the masses, the masses were relieved and happy. They all said that this year's method was "well-founded and fair and reasonable." The reaction of the farmers in Renhe Township, Jishan County, to the new grain purchase method can represent the opinions of the vast number of farmers in the entire special district. They summarized five major benefits of this year's grain purchase method: First, it is simple and easy to implement. Hou Fuguang, the head of finance and grain, said: "Subtracting the tax exemption point from the standard mu and then multiplying by the unified purchase rate gives the amount of grain that should be sold. The masses can calculate how much surplus grain they should sell themselves." Second, it is fair and reasonable. Wang Chunshu, the head of an agricultural producers' cooperative, said: "This year's method is much better than last year's. Purchasing grain at a fixed rate based on the standard mu is fair and reasonable." Third, it truly purchases surplus grain. Xu Shuiliang, a technician at an agricultural producers' cooperative, said: "The government is truly breaking its heart for the people. Not only does it deduct tax exemption points based on the population, leaving enough rations, but it also deducts the public grain, livestock feed, and seeds that each household should pay, and additionally leaves 10 to 30 percent of the surplus grain." Fourth, it can encourage production. Farmer Ning Xinquan said: "Calculating surplus grain based on the expected yield and not purchasing the overproduction part is the state's encouragement for us to work hard and improve production." Fifth, it is considerate. Zhao Ziming, the director of a credit cooperative, said: "Those who have suffered disasters have tax exemptions and reductions; families with only one or two people are given tax exemption points based on one and a half and two and a half people, which is truly reasonable and considerate."

    Having a good grain purchase method alone is not enough to complete, especially not to overfulfill, the grain purchase task. This year's grain purchase work in Yuncheng Special District was carried out with the cooperation of strong political work. Before the start of the grain purchase work and during the grain purchase work, the counties vigorously publicized the draft constitution and the benefits that the state's implementation of unified purchase and sale of grain brought to the farmers. In the publicity, because the localities proceeded from specific circumstances and flexibly used methods such as recollection, comparison, and accounting, the vast number of farmers used their own personal experiences to think about the past years of poverty and suffering, being enslaved and exploited, and looked at today's happy, free, and increasingly prosperous life, and looked forward to a more beautiful tomorrow. They were all very excited. The farmers said that under the leadership of Chairman Mao, "life is getting better and better." They actively sold their surplus grain to support national construction.

    Last winter, when the cadres publicized the benefits of unified purchase of grain to the masses, because the masses had not personally experienced it, their understanding was not so intimate. This year, the situation was different. After the state implemented the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, poor farmers who lacked grain ate the grain supplied by the state at reasonable prices and were no longer subject to grain usury; prices were stable and were no longer subject to fraud by unscrupulous merchants—this point was particularly deeply felt by the farmers in Yuncheng Special District. Last spring, before the implementation of unified grain purchase, the wheat suffered from frost damage, and the grain price immediately rose by nearly 100 percent; this year, the wheat suffered from frost damage again, but because the state implemented the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, the grain price did not rise at all. Each county used this concrete fact to calculate an account for the farmers. Due to the stability of grain prices alone, the farmers in each county, depending on their size, avoided between 3 billion and 10 billion yuan in intermediate exploitation by unscrupulous merchants—in fact, every farmer has a personal experience of the benefits of the state's unified purchase of grain. As long as we are good at inspiring and guiding, the masses themselves will be able to say many vivid facts, and the masses will become active propagandists of "unified purchase of grain is beneficial to the country and the people," and "supporting the state's policy of unified purchase and sale of grain" and "selling surplus grain to the state" will become public opinion and the conscious action of the masses. After Jieyu County used the fact that a tractor station was established in the county this year to publicize to the farmers the benefits of selling surplus grain to support the country's industrial construction, it aroused a grain-selling craze among the farmers in the county. The best illustration is that from June 26 to July 15, the county purchased 2.65 million catties of grain in just 20 days, exceeding the state's planned task by nearly 100 percent.

    At the same time as carrying out the work of unified grain purchase, doing a good job in the work of unified grain sales and the supply of materials is another key to the successful completion of the task of unified purchase in Yuncheng Special District this time. In the process of unified purchase, the counties not only did not interrupt the grain supply work, but also conducted surveys and appraisals of grain-deficient households, and then issued grain purchase certificates to grain-deficient households. The grain purchase certificate stated the quantity of grain supplied by the state. Grain-deficient households could take their grain purchase certificates and buy the grain they needed from the places where the state sold grain at any time. This thoroughly eliminated the dissatisfaction and doubts of some of the masses caused by certain shortcomings in the spring supply work, further strengthened the relationship between the Party and the People's Government and the masses, promoted the smooth completion of the grain purchase work, and stabilized and encouraged the masses' production enthusiasm. After receiving the grain purchase certificates, grain-deficient households actively promoted the grain purchase work in the village and mobilized surplus grain households to sell surplus grain to the state, and thanked the People's Government for their concern with practical actions of actively working hard to produce. When Han Langshou of Jishan Village, Linjin County, received his grain purchase certificate, he said with emotion: "What else is there to say? Let's focus on production."

    The mutual cooperation of various economic departments, especially doing a good job in the supply of means of production and means of livelihood, can not only create favorable conditions for completing the grain purchase work, but also help and "guide farmers to expand investment and develop production," balance currency circulation, and stabilize prices. The counties paid great attention to this aspect of work in the grain purchase work, and supplied farmers with a large amount of means of production and means of livelihood. In July, the two counties of Pinglu and Linjin alone supplied farmers with nearly 10 billion yuan worth of materials, which strongly promoted the grain purchase work and agricultural production.

    In the busy month of July, Yuncheng Special District, Shanxi Province, overfulfilled the annual unified grain purchase task and promoted various tasks. In the busy month of July, the cadres and people of Yuncheng Special District did a lot of work and created great achievements. Now, Shanxi Province is promoting the experience of Yuncheng Special District and is successfully carrying out the province's grain purchase work and agricultural cooperation movement.

    [Note 1] Yuncheng Special District was merged with Linfen Special District in September to form Jinan Special District.

    [Note 2] This number is the common number of Jinan Special District, which is the original Yuncheng Special District and Linfen Special District.

    [Note 3] In recent years, under the leadership of the Party, agricultural production has developed greatly, and the actual yield of land is generally higher than the "expected yield." During the winter grain purchase this year, the Provincial Finance Committee further developed the Yuncheng experience by adding 10, 20, or 30 percent to the "expected yield" based on the specific situation of the actual yield, as the "general yield," and purchasing surplus grain based on the general yield.

    购粮任务为什么完成得又好又快
    本报记者　田流
    七月，是农村里十分忙碌的季节。麦子熟啦，要收割；麦田要翻耕；棉花要掐尖整枝；要割蒿打草压绿肥；为了保证大秋作物丰收，一切庄稼都要锄草、分苗、保苗和施肥……。
    今年七月，更是农村干部们十分忙碌的季节。要宣传和领导群众讨论宪法草案；要进行基层选举和开好各级人民代表大会会议；要整顿、巩固和提高互助组、农业生产合作社；要作好小学毕业生升学和参加生产的工作；要完成农业税的夏季征收工作；……还要在这群众忙干部忙，生产忙工作忙的七月里，完成统购小麦的任务。
    山西省运城专区〔注一〕完成了并且超额完成了这一巨大的统购粮食的任务。
    运城专区在山西省的南部。黄河从西边和南边环绕着它。包括永济、平陆、解虞等十三个县。与陕西省的关中地区隔河相望。这个专区是山西省最富饶的地区，盛产小麦和棉花，全部土地除种植棉花外，百分之九十左右的土地，都是种小麦。因此，麦收后进行购粮，就是统购全年的粮食。完成了夏季购粮任务，就是完成了全年的购粮任务。
    今年，运城专区的统购粮食任务，完成的很快，从六月下旬到七月底，不仅把粮食“从农民手中买了出来”，而且已经胜利地入库了。任务完成的快——并不是干部强迫命令使它快起来的。这从广大农民踊跃售粮的热烈情景；从卖粮后农民生产热情进一步高涨中，就可以清楚地看出来。运城专区的购粮任务是和农业税夏季征收工作同时进行的，共超额一千一百多万斤，一起完成了夏征和统购任务。超额完成任务——并不是农民把自己的口粮也卖了。正相反，购粮后农民手里仍有余粮，仅七、八、九三个月里，国家又在初级粮食市场上收购了七百多万斤粮食〔注二〕，就是最好的证明。任务完成的好，又完成的快——并不是运城专区的干部放下了别的工作、别的任务不作，只作购粮这一件事情。不是的。和购粮工作同时，他们使百分之八十以上的群众受到了宪法教育；开好了县人民代表大会；使农业生产合作社由一百九十五个发展到九百七十八个；供销合作社和信用合作社也有了进一步地发展，几乎乡乡都有了供销合作社和信用合作社；使爱国增产运动和农业社会主义改造有了一个新的高涨………。
    既完成的快，又完成的好，这工作是怎样作的？有什么好的经验？
    山西省运城专区的购粮工作，去年是用“政治动员，民主评议”的方法进行的。在当时，这是一个可行的正确的方法。但是，伴随着这个方法，购粮工作中也产生了一些缺点和偏差：先进农民和农村中的积极分子，都踊跃地卖出了自己的余粮，甚至卖的透了底，把口粮也卖了；另一部分农民又卖的很少，甚至没有卖出自己的余粮；加上时间短促，不完全了解情况，评议中也有偏轻偏重的现象。农民卖的透了底或是评议的重了，会影响农民的生活和生产积极性；农民没有卖出自己应卖的余粮或是评议的轻了，又完不成国家统购粮食的任务，影响国家建设。
      根据这种情况，根据实行粮食统购统销政策后农村经济发生的新变化，中共山西省委会认为，今年已经有条件使统购粮食的工作，逐渐形成制度走上正规，以避免去年发生过的缺点和偏差，更好地贯彻国家的粮食统购统销政策。经过缜密地研究，由省财委会拟出了一个“比照农业税标准亩计算余粮”的统购办法。
    农业税（农民管它叫“公粮”）的征收制度，在山西省大部地区已经实行十多年了，就是像运城专区这样的晚解放区也有四、五年的历史了，群众对它十分熟悉。农业税本身，经过多年的调查、修正和改进，也比较公平合理。把征收农业税的经验应用到统购粮食的工作上，一可以适应群众习惯，二可以作到公平合理，三可以像农业税一样鼓励农民的生产积极性和劳动热情。省财委在拟定这个购粮办法时，就是比照农业税计算“标准亩”的原则，根据本省农民消费水平确定“免购点”，和遵照中央的余粮多的多购，少的少购，没余粮的不购并给农民留一些余粮的政策，确定统购余粮的百分之七十到九十的“统购率”（富农可统购到余粮的百分之九十五）。统购时，把农户的土地按应产量〔注三〕折合成标准亩，再从标准亩总数（即应产量总数）中扣除农业税，人的口粮，牲畜（包括猪）的饲料和土地的种子后，就是今年该农户的余粮数；然后用统购率一乘，就是应该卖给国家的余粮数目了。
    购粮的办法是有了，但这毕竟是一件新的工作，干部缺乏成熟的经验，加上七月里生产忙工作多任务重，就更增加了工作的复杂性。为了把这个工作作好，中共山西省委会一面要求各地“全党动员，全力以赴”，在工作部署上要“以生产为中心，购粮为重点，宪法为动力”地使各项工作密切结合同时作好；一面抽调大批干部分赴各地检查和帮助工作。仅派到运城专区的干部，就有二百多人。在省委工作组直接帮助下，运城专区各县，普遍召开了县、区、乡三级干部会议，并动员与组织了四千七百多人，组成很多的工作组直接深入农村，帮助乡村干部进行工作。在正式开始进行统购工作以前，各县都进行了典型乡的调查和试点工作，来确定“标准亩”、“应产量”和“统购率”——这是很重要的。不然，每个人扣除多少标准亩为“免购点”才合适呢？在本县的具体情况下，“统购率”应该是百分之七十、八十，还是百分之九十呢？在试点中，各县解决了这些问题，都根据生产发展的不同情况，把本县划分了若干经济区、确定了不同经济区的不同的免购点、统购率以及牲畜饲料和种子的扣除标准。
    夏收以后，农民根据自己的经验，知道国家一定要统购粮食，但怎样统购，统购多少呢？不摸底。是不是还像去年冬天那样“没个章法”呢——群众对去年购粮的办法是有顾虑的。当干部们把今年统购粮食的办法向群众公布后，群众安心了，高兴了。都说今年这办法“有依有据，公平合理”。稷山县仁和乡农民对新的购粮办法的反映，可以代表全专区广大农民的意见。他们给今年的购粮办法一共总结出五大好处：第一是简便易行。财粮主任侯福光说：“拿标准亩减去免购点，再用统购率一乘就是应卖的粮数，群众自己就能算出该卖多少余粮”；第二是公平合理。农业生产合作社社长王春树说：“今年的办法比去年好的多，按标准亩依率购粮公平合理”；第三是真正购的余粮。农业生产合作社技术员许水龙说：“政府真替人把心操碎了，不光按人口扣除免购点，留下足够的口粮；扣除每家应纳的公粮、牲口饲料和土地的种子，格外还给留下百分之十到三十的余粮”；第四是能鼓励生产。农民宁新全说：“按应产量计算余粮，超产部分不购，是国家鼓励咱好好劳动提高生产”；第五是照顾周到。信用合作社主任赵子明说：“遭了灾害有免购减购；家里只一口人、两口人的，按一个半和两个半人给除免购点，真是合情合理照顾周到。”
    光有一个好的购粮办法，是不能完成尤其不会超额完成购粮任务的。运城专区今年的购粮工作，是在强大的政治工作配合下进行的。在购粮工作开始以前和购粮工作进行过程中，各县都大张旗鼓地宣传了宪法草案和国家实行粮食统购统销所给农民的好处。在宣传中，由于各地从具体情况出发，灵活地运用了回忆、对比和算账等方法，广大农民用自己的亲身经验，想想过去那种又穷又苦、被奴役被剥削的灾难深重的岁月，看看今天幸福、自由、日益富裕的生活，望望更加美好的明天，都十分兴奋，农民们说在毛主席领导的新中国“日子越过越有兴头”。他们踊跃地卖出余粮，支援国家建设。
    去年冬天，干部们向群众宣传统购粮食的好处时，因为群众还没有亲身经历过，认识不那么亲切，今年情形就不同了。国家实行粮食统购统销政策以后，贫苦缺粮的农民，吃到了国家以合理价格供应的粮食，再也不受粮食高利贷的剥削了；物价稳定，再也不受奸商的欺诈了——这一点，运城专区的农民体会特别深切。去年春天，还没有实行粮食统购前，小麦遭了冻灾，立时粮价就涨了将近一倍；今年小麦又遭了冻灾，可是因为国家实行了统购统销政策，粮价一点也没涨。各县都用这个具体的事实，给农民算了一笔账，只粮价稳定一项，各县因大小不同，农民们就避免了奸商的中间剥削三十亿元到一百亿元——其实，农民们对于国家统购粮食的好处，是每个人都有切身的体会的，只要我们善于启发引导，群众自己就会说出许多生动的事实，群众就会变成“统购粮食对国家对人民都有好处”的积极宣传者，“拥护国家的粮食统购统销政策”、“把余粮卖给国家”就会成为社会舆论和群众的自觉行动。解虞县用今年在本县建立起拖拉机站的事实，向农民宣传了出售余粮支援国家工业建设对农民的好处后，激起了全县农民的售粮热潮。该县从六月二十六日到七月十五日，仅二十天的工夫，就统购了二百六十五万斤粮食，超过国家计划任务将近一倍，就是最好的说明。
    在进行粮食统购工作同时，作好粮食统销工作和物资供应工作，是这次运城专区胜利完成统购任务的又一关键。各县在统购工作中，不仅没有中断粮食供应工作，同时还对缺粮户进行了摸底、评议工作，接着又给缺粮户发了购粮证。购粮证上写着由国家供应粮食的数量，缺粮户拿着自己的购粮证，随时可以到国家出售粮食的地方买到自己所需要的粮食，这就彻底消除了因春季供应工作上的某些缺点，而引起的部分群众的不满和疑虑，进一步密切了党与人民政府同群众的关系，推动了购粮工作的顺利完成，安定和鼓励了群众的生产情绪。缺粮户领到购粮证后，积极推动村里的购粮工作和动员余粮户出售余粮给国家，并用积极劳动努力生产的实际行动，感谢人民政府对他们的关怀。临晋县积善村韩浪守领到购粮证时感动地说：“这还有啥说的，一心一意搞生产吧。”
    各个经济部门的相互配合，特别是作好生产资料与生活资料的供应工作，不仅能够为完成购粮工作创造有利条件，更可以帮助与“指导农民扩大投资，发展生产”，平衡货币投放，稳定物价。各县在购粮工作中，都十分注意了这方面的工作，供应了农民大量的生产资料和生活资料，七月份里，仅平陆和临晋两个县，就供应了将近一百亿元的物资给农民，有力地推动了购粮工作和农业生产。
    在忙碌的七月里，山西省运城专区超额完成了全年的统购粮食任务，并推动了各项工作。在忙碌的七月里，运城专区的干部和人民，作好了很多的工作，创造了很大的成绩，现在，山西全省正在推广着运城专区的经验，胜利地进行着全省的粮食统购工作和农业合作化运动。
    〔注一〕运城专区九月间已和临汾专区合并为晋南专区。
    〔注二〕这个数字是晋南专区即原运城专区和临汾专区的共同数字。
    〔注三〕几年来在党的领导下，农业生产都有极大发展，土地的实产量一般都高于“应产量”，今年冬季购粮时，省财委又把运城经验发展了一步，按实产量的具体情况，在“应产量”上加一成，二成或三成，作为“通产量”，按通产量收购余粮。
