    Two Large-Scale Farmland Irrigation Projects Commence in Hubei Province
    The second phase of the Shilang Over-River Reservoir project and the Caobuhu Sluice Gate project in Hubei Province have commenced. These two projects will irrigate more than 300,000 mu of farmland and reduce the harm of floods and waterlogging.

    The Shilang Over-River Reservoir is located in Jingshan County and is one of the large-scale farmland irrigation projects currently under construction in Hubei Province. The first phase of the project, including the reservoir earth dam and aqueduct, completed in early August this year, played a significant role in flood prevention this year, ensuring a bumper harvest of 180,000 mu of crops in Jingshan, Tianmen counties, and the State-run May 3rd Farm. The second phase of the project mainly includes more than 130 large and small projects, such as a 120-li long irrigation canal, spillway, canal structures, flood discharge gate, control gate, and highway bridge. Since construction began in October, an average of more than 5,000 people have participated in the construction every day, and more than 10,000 farmers from the surrounding area have come to support in shifts. Currently, more than 413,000 cubic meters of earthwork for the canal have been completed, and masonry and concrete pouring are underway for various structures. The entire project is expected to be completed in February or March next year, and 250,000 mu of paddy fields will be able to be irrigated and planted in time next spring.

    The Caobuhu Sluice Gate will be built on the Zhangjiakou section of the Ju Zhang River in Dangyang County. Every flood season, the river rises sharply and flows backward, making it difficult to discharge inland water, often resulting in flooding. This sluice gate will protect the safe growth of more than 50,000 mu of cultivated land in the State-run Caobuhu Farm and more than 47,000 mu of cotton fields and crops in the four townships of Yuhu, Sunchang, and others. The work of drilling the gate foundation for this project began in early November.

    湖北省两项较大的农田水利工程开工
    湖北省石龙过江水库的第二期工程和草埠湖水闸工程两项较大的农田水利工程开工。这两项工程将使三十多万亩农田得到灌溉和减轻洪水积水的危害。
    石龙过江水库位于京山县境，是湖北省目前兴修的大型农田水利工程之一。今年八月初完成的水库土坝、输水道等第一期工程，在今年防汛中起了很大作用，保住了京山、天门两县和国营五三农场的十八万亩农作物丰收。第二期工程主要有长一百二十里的灌溉干渠和溢洪道、渠道建筑物、泄洪闸、节制闸、公路桥等大小工程一百三十多座。十月开工以来，每天平均有五千多人参加施工，周围有一万多农民轮流前来支援。目前，渠道土方已完成四十一万三千多公方，各项建筑物正进行砌石、浇灌混凝土。明年二三月全部工程即可完工，二十五万亩稻田明春能及时灌溉插秧。
    草埠湖水闸将建筑在当阳县沮漳河的张家口上。沮漳河每逢汛期，河水猛涨倒灌，内水难泄，常常泛滥成灾。这座水闸将保护着国营草埠湖农场的五万多亩垦植田和渔湖、孙场等四个乡的四万七千多亩棉田庄稼安全生长。十一月初这项工程的钻探闸基的工作已经开工。
