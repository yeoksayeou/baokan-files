    Han River Railway Bridge Completed
    [Our newspaper's Wuhan dispatch on the 20th] An important component of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge – the Han River Railway Bridge – has been completed. The two cities of Hankou and Hanyang, separated by the Han River and reliant on small boats for crossing, are now connected by a railway bridge.
    Construction of the Han River Railway Bridge began on November 27th of last year, and with the pouring of the final concrete steel frame support on November 19th, it has taken nearly a year. This has been a year of arduous struggle for the workers building the Han River Railway Bridge. During the most intense days of the foundation work, workers often had to persevere in the cold, wind, and rain on the water. Entering the summer, the builders of the railway bridge engaged in a remarkable race against the floodwaters, and they successfully poured the concrete for the No. 5 pier three days before the floodwaters submerged the 18-meter-high wooden caisson. The construction of the Han River Railway Bridge is also a rich and practical bridge-building school, and many talents have grown up here. Ordinary young workers have been able to operate and manage universal pile drivers and floating cranes in as little as a month or a few months. Riveters and fitters who have undergone only three months of training have now become skilled divers. More than two hundred bridge engineering students from universities and specialized schools have interned here, and fourteen of them who have remained here are already working as technicians, foremen, and leading workers.
    At present, the connecting line from the Yudaimen Station, the terminus of the Beijing-Hankou Railway, to the left bank of the Han River Railway Bridge has been completed. The construction of the Hanyang connecting line, starting from the right bank of the Han River Railway Bridge, is proceeding day and night at a hectic pace. This connecting line will pass through the deep waters of Tanghu Lake, and the stones filled in the lake have now emerged from the water. Soon, trains on the Beijing-Hankou Railway will be able to reach the bridgehead construction site of the Yangtze River Bridge directly.

    汉水铁桥已经建设完成
    【本报武汉二十日电】武汉长江大桥的重要组成部分——汉水铁桥已经建设完成。被汉水分隔、靠扁舟横渡的汉口和汉阳两座城市，现在已经由铁桥连接在一起了。
    汉水铁桥从去年十一月二十七日开工，到十一月十九日浇灌最后一个混凝土钢架支柱，历时将近一年。这是建设汉水铁桥的职工们的艰苦奋斗的一年。在基础工程最紧张的日子里，工人们经常要在严寒的风雨交加的水上坚持工作。进入夏季，铁桥的建设者和洪水进行了出色的赛跑，他们在洪水淹没十八公尺高的木沉井的前三天，就及时把第五号桥墩的混凝土浇灌好了。汉水铁桥的建设同时是一座丰富而实际的桥梁学校，很多人材从这里成长起来。普通的青年工人有的只花了一个月或几个月的时间，便能驾驶和管理万能打桩机和吊船了。仅仅经过三个月训练的铆工和钳工，现在已经成为熟练的潜水员。有二百多名大、专学校学桥梁工程的学生曾在这里实习，其中留在这里的十四名学生，已经担任着技术员、工长和领工员的工作。
    目前，从京汉铁路的终点玉带门车站到汉水铁桥左岸的联络线已经竣工；以汉水铁桥右岸为起点的汉阳联络线的工程正在昼夜紧张进行，这条联络线要穿过汤湖的深水，湖中所填的石块现已露出水面。不久以后，京汉路上的火车，就可以直达长江大桥的桥头工地了。
