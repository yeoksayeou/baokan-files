Pour Bombs on the Enemy's Head
By Our Reporter Wang Jinfeng
　　
　　On the morning of November 1st, the sun had just risen from the horizon. At a certain airport, aircrew members, neatly dressed in their flight suits, and ground crew members in black overalls, stood facing the rising sun under the "August 1st" military flag, ready to resolutely carry out the order to bomb the upper and lower Dachen Islands. They swore to the Party, Chairman Mao, and the people of the motherland: "Be resolute and tenacious, resourceful and calm, overcome all difficulties, eliminate the enemy... under no circumstances bow to difficulties..." At that moment, Zhang Weiliang, the air commander leading the oath, remembered the oath he took when crossing the river southward; navigator Ding Jixiang remembered the oath he took when marching south and entering the pass; communications operator Zhao Zhongen remembered the oath he took when he signed up for military cadre school… Since then, how far has the People’s Liberation Army advanced! From having no air force to establishing one, from millet and rifles to rocket launchers and jets. They have also advanced with the PLA. Zhang Weiliang and Ding Jixiang, originally from the army, came to the air force; Zhao Zhongen, originally a student at Beijing No. 25 Middle School, also came to aviation school. Together, they got up at three in the morning in sub-zero temperatures to go to the airport, returning only when it was dark, dragging their tired bodies. Together, they tenaciously overcame learning difficulties and mastered complex aviation technology. Now, the motherland has issued the sacred call to "liberate Taiwan without fail." At the celebration of the 27th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army, Commander-in-Chief Zhu said: All commanders and fighters of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army's army, navy, and air force must strengthen political and military training, master their weapons and joint operations, accelerate the modernization of national defense, raise vigilance, and always maintain combat readiness, fight bravely on the front lines, and strive to liberate Taiwan and defend the motherland. Following this instruction, for several months, their unit has been flying and practicing bombing continuously, treating the training ground as a battlefield, and constantly improving the quality of bombing training. Four consecutive fives, five consecutive fives, six consecutive fives… New records are appearing on the honor roll. And how many sleepless nights have the ground crew had! They get up with the stars and work under the moon, checking the planes over and over again, troubleshooting. At that time, they always felt that the eyes of the people of the whole country were watching them, asking them with concern: "Is the plane reliable? Is it safe? Can it complete the task?" And those staff members, political workers, their lights are always the last to go out. Carrying shells, driving cars, inspecting fuel, responsible for supply and cooking... In recent days, their eyes have also been covered with bloodshot streaks. All aspects of preparation constitute a huge net, everything for victory! Victory will be condensed in this imminent moment.
　　
　　The time for takeoff has arrived. As the ground commander waved the white flag, Zhang Weiliang, the leader, released the brakes, increased the throttle, and gently pulled back the control stick, and the plane lifted off lightly. He watched the instruments, and his skilled hands accurately maintained the specified speed and altitude. He trusts his wingman and his partners behind him. Behind him are Song Zongzhou, who has been tempered in the army for a long time and has been awarded three major merits and served as the deputy instructor of a certain company of the Tashan Hero Regiment, Li Tianxiu, a combat model who has been awarded one major merit, one second-class merit, and seven third-class merits, and Bai Jinwen, who came from school, received strict training in the army, and completed a long-distance solo flight in the most recent combat training mission, overcoming bad weather… They all followed him closely, forming a formation like wild geese, passing over the airport. At this time, the crowd at the airport below kept waving and cheering, as if they really thought the people on the plane could hear their voices. Suddenly, from the left rear, another fleet flew in on time to join the formation, circling back and forth to the left, right, front, and rear of the bombers, drawing beautiful horizontal lines in the sky. At this time, every member in the bomber felt a pair of powerful hands beside them, and they proudly felt that our air position was as stable as Mount Tai.
　　
　　The fleet advanced smoothly and neatly along the route. Below is the land of the motherland, the land after the harvest, the land that our brave and hardworking people are building day and night. High mountains are covered with layers of terraced fields, and the winding roads are like a white belt winding around the green peaks. The blue river is shining below, and the steamship is running smoothly in the river. In front, a bright blue sea appeared again, with dozens of fishing boats sailing in the offshore waters. What a beautiful country, a beautiful motherland! But on the other side of the sea, two black dots appeared, lying there lonely. Zhang Weiliang glanced at the map, and his heart suddenly shrank: it was upper and lower Dachen, so close to the mainland! This island is the largest lair of the Chiang bandits on the Zhejiang sea. They sent warships from here to intercept fishermen and merchant ships, bombarded coastal villages, and trained and sent spies from here to sneak into the mainland. Now they seem to be lying there asleep, as if the foolish enemy has not yet discovered us. "XX, have you spotted the target?" Zhang Weiliang called out the code name of the navigator Cai Zhichen, inquiring about him. "I see it, I see it." Cai Zhichen replied, while preparing for the bombing. The fleet made a turn and came to the sea. Zhang Weiliang aimed the nose of the plane at Dachen, and found a white spot and a black spot in the bay between upper and lower Dachen. "It's the enemy's warship." Zhang Weiliang couldn't help but feel a burst of ecstasy, and called Cai Zhichen again: "Is it a warship in front?" "Yes, yes, it's a warship." Cai Zhichen's voice was also very excited, and he could clearly see the warship from the sight. At this time, one or two white smokes rose from the white warship. The enemy only discovered it at this time and started anti-aircraft guns. Clusters of white and black smoke passed through the fuselage from front to back, left and right. Zhang Weiliang, who joined the army at the age of twelve, had been tempered in the army, experienced the entire period of the Liberation War, and had already learned the Kuomintang army's artillery fire. Now he knows that these anti-aircraft artillery fire is trying to form a fire net to block his fleet from advancing. "When I only had rifles and grenades, your planes and artillery did not stop my advance. Now that I am flying a plane, do you think your little anti-aircraft fire can stop me?" Zhang Weiliang secretly ridiculed the enemy, maintaining a calm flying posture as usual. Cai Zhichen had already put the white warship in the sight. "Drop the bombs." He pressed a button, and a series of bombs fell. Immediately afterwards, Song Zongzhou also followed and dropped the bombs. Another crew, Zuo Naichang's plane, had already reached the airspace above Dachen, dropping bombs on the densely packed core fortifications on the island. Many military targets were bombed into a sea of ​​fire, and two anti-aircraft artillery positions were completely destroyed. All our planes safely disengaged from the target. The fighter planes followed closely behind, shuttling back and forth, and the crew members on the bombers all pressed their hands on the triggers, forming a tight firepower network for air surveillance. However, no enemy planes chased after them. The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique entrenched on the upper and lower Dachen Islands and Taiwan completely failed to recover from this sudden and heavy blow. All our planes returned safely. This is the steel hand of the people of the motherland, a heavy blow to the Chiang bandits entrenched on the Zhejiang sea. An even heavier blow is yet to come!

    把炸弹倾倒在敌人头上
    本报记者　王金凤
    十一月一日清晨，朝日刚从地平线上升起。在某机场，已整整齐齐地穿着飞行装的空勤人员和穿着黑色工作服的地勤人员迎着初升的朝日，为了坚决执行轰炸上下大陈岛的命令，站在“八一”军旗下，向党、向毛主席和祖国人民宣誓：“坚决顽强，机智沉着，战胜一切困难，消灭敌人，……在任何情况下不向困难低头，……。”在这一刻，带头宣誓的空中指挥员张伟良想起了南下渡江时的宣誓，领航员丁继祥想起南征入关时的宣誓，通讯员赵仲恩想起报名参加军事干部学校时的宣誓……。从那时以来，解放军前进了多少路啊！从没有空军到建立空军，从小米、步枪到火箭炮，喷气式。他们也随着解放军的前进而前进。原来是陆军的张伟良和丁继祥来到空军，原来是北京二十五中学学生的赵仲恩也来到航校。他们共同在零下十几度的严寒中半夜三点起床上机场，天黑了才拖着疲乏的身体回来。他们共同顽强地克服了学习的困难，掌握了复杂的航空技术。现在，祖国发出了“一定要解放台湾”的神圣号召，在中国人民解放军建军二十七周年纪念大会上，朱总司令说：中国人民解放军陆、海、空军全体指挥员、战斗员必须加强政治、军事训练，熟练手中武器和诸兵种协同作战，加速国防现代化的建设，提高警惕性，经常保持战斗准备，在前线英勇作战，为解放台湾、保卫祖国而奋斗。他们遵循着这个指示，几个月来，他们这个部队不间断地飞行，练习轰炸，把靶场当作战场，不断提高轰炸训练的质量。连续四次五分、五次五分、六次五分……光荣榜上出现着一个个新纪录。而地勤人员又该有多少不眠的夜啊！他们顶着星星起床，顶着月亮工作，一遍又一遍地检查着飞机，排除着故障。那时候，他们总感到全国人民的眼睛都在看着他们，关心地问着他们：“飞机可靠吗？安全吗？完得成任务吧？”而那些参谋人员，政治工作人员啊，他们房里的灯总是最后熄灭的。搬运炮弹的，驾驶汽车的，检验油料的，负责供应和炊事工作的……这些天来，他们的眼睛上也布满了血丝。这各方面的准备工作组成了一个巨大的网，一切为了胜利！胜利就将凝集在这即将来临的时刻中。
    起飞的时间到了。当地面指挥员把白旗一挥，领队长机张伟良双脚松开煞车，加大油门，将操纵杆轻轻往后一带，飞机就轻快地离地了。他注视着仪表，熟练的手准确地保持着规定的速度和高度。他信赖着他的僚机和他后面的伙伴。在他后面有在陆军中久经锻炼、立过三次大功的曾任塔山英雄团某连副指导员的宋宗周，有立过一次大功、一次二等功、七次三等功的战斗模范李天休，也有从学校出来、受着部队严格锻炼、在最近一次战斗训练任务中单机长途飞行、战胜恶劣天气、完成了任务的白锦文……他们都紧紧跟随着他，像大雁一样编好队，从机场上空通过。这时，下面机场上的人群不住地招手欢呼，他们仿佛真以为飞机上的人会听到他们的声音。突然，从左后方，另一机群准时地飞来加入编队，他们在轰炸机的左右前后来回逡巡，在天空划着美妙的横线。这时候，在轰炸机里的每个乘员都感觉到一双有力的手就在身旁，他们骄傲地感到我们的空中阵地稳如泰山。
    机群平稳地整齐地沿着航线前进。下面是祖国的大地，丰收后的大地，我们勇敢勤劳的人民在日夜建设着的大地。高高的山峦上遍布着一层层的梯田，公路曲曲折折像一条白带似地绕过绿色的山峰，蓝色江水在下面发着闪光，汽轮在江中平稳地奔驰着。在前面又出现了一片灿烂的碧蓝的海，几十条渔船在近海扬帆捕鱼。多么美好的河山，美好的祖国啊！但是就在大海的那边，出现了两个黑点，孤零零地躺在那里。张伟良看了一眼地图，心突然一下收了回来：是上、下大陈哪，离大陆这么近！就是这个岛屿，是浙江海面蒋贼军最大的巢穴。他们从这里派出军舰，拦劫渔民和商船，炮轰沿海村庄，又在这里训练和派出特务，潜入大陆。现在它们仿佛安静地躺在那里睡觉似的，愚蠢的敌人还没有发现我们。“××号，你发现目标没有？”张伟良呼喊着领航员蔡之臣的代号。询问着他。“看见了，看见了”。蔡之臣一面回答，一面做好轰炸前的准备。机群一转弯，来到海面上了。张伟良把机头对准了大陈，又发现在上、下大陈之间的海湾中有一个白点和一个黑点。“是敌人的军舰”。张伟良禁不住心头一阵狂喜，再一次叫着蔡之臣：“前面是不是军舰？”“是的，是的，是军舰”。蔡之臣回答的声音也很兴奋，他从瞄准具里也清清楚楚看到了军舰。这时候，从白色的军舰上冒起了一朵、两朵的白烟，敌人到这时候才发现，打起高射炮来。一团团的白烟和黑烟，在机身前后左右穿过。从十二岁就参军、在部队中身经百战、曾经经历了解放战争整个时期的张伟良，早已领教过国民党部队的炮火，现在他知道这些高射炮火企图构成一片火网，拦阻他的机群前进。“在我只拿着步枪、手榴弹的时候，你的飞机、大炮也没有拦阻了我的前进。现在，我驾上了飞机，你这点高射炮火还想挡住我吗？”张伟良暗暗嘲笑着敌人，和平时一样沉着地保持好飞行姿态。蔡之臣这时已在瞄准具中套好了白色的军舰。“投弹”。他一按电钮，一片炸弹落了下去。紧接着，后面宋宗周也跟着把炸弹扔下去了。另一个机组左乃昌的飞机已经到了大陈上空，向着那岛上密布的核心工事投下弹去。许多军事目标被炸成一片火海，两个高射炮阵地被彻底摧毁了。我们的飞机全部安全地脱离了目标。歼击机紧跟在后面穿来穿去，轰炸机上的乘员都把手按在枪机上，组成对空监视的严密的火力网。但是，没有一架敌机追来。盘踞在上、下大陈岛和台湾的蒋介石卖国集团在这突如其来的沉重打击下，完全没有来得及清醒过来。我们所有的飞机安全返航了。这是祖国人民钢铁的手，对于盘踞在浙江海面蒋贼军的一次沉重的打击。更沉重的打击还在后面哩！
