    Qiqihar No. 1 Machine Tool Plant Uses Special Topic Meetings to Leverage Collective Wisdom to Solve Technical Problems in Trial Manufacturing New Products
    This year, the state-owned Qiqihar No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, in the complex task of trial manufacturing and manufacturing new machine tools, utilized special topic meetings to leverage collective wisdom, which played a significant role in overcoming the factory's weak technical capabilities.
    This spring, after the preparatory work for the trial manufacture of the Six Н-12 vertical milling machine began, seven major operational key problems arose. At this time, the factory leadership convened more than 30 veteran workers and technicians from the entire factory to hold special topic meetings to solve them. All the workers participating in the special discussions put forward many important opinions based on the reports of relevant technical personnel. For example, regarding the "bed body boring" processing method, one of the key issues, after discussion and modification, the cost of making fixtures alone was several tens of millions of yuan less than originally planned. When the workers of the Second Workshop encountered difficulties in operating the boring machine while trial-manufacturing the spindle hole of the Six H-12 vertical milling machine bed body, the workshop promptly organized relevant technical personnel and workers to hold several special topic meetings. Finally, the boring machine workers proposed using a "self-boring fixture," which smoothly solved the processing method for this process.
    Special topic meetings not only promptly solved many technical problems that arose temporarily during trial manufacture and manufacture, but also promoted employees to study technology and further improve their technical level. Among the 427 workers who were promoted this year in the factory, many improved their skills by actively participating in special topic meetings. Gao Baoqing, a boring machine worker who actively participated in special topic meetings, initially took thirty-one hours to make a "chuck body" for a axle lathe, but later reduced it to ten hours and thirty minutes. When the workers of the Second Workshop began trial manufacturing the Six H-12 vertical milling machine, the scrap rate was as high as 20 percent, but by the third quarter, due to a reduction in worker operating errors, the scrap rate had dropped to 1 percent.

    齐齐哈尔第一机床厂运用专题会议形式
    发挥集体智慧解决试制新产品的技术问题
    国营齐齐哈尔第一机床厂今年在试制和制造新式机床的复杂任务中，运用专题会议形式发挥集体智慧，对克服厂内技术力量薄弱的困难起了很大作用。
    今年春天，这个厂试制六Н一二立式铣床的准备工作开始后，就发生了七个重大的操作上的关键问题，这时，厂的领导方面召集全厂三十多位老工人和技术人员一起，开专题会议加以解决。参加专题讨论的全体工人根据有关技术人员的报告，提出了很多重要的意见，例如关键之一的“床身搪孔”加工方法，经过讨论修改后，光是做卡具的费用就要比原计划节省几千万元。第二车间职工在试制六H一二立式铣床床身的主轴孔时，使用搪床操作有困难，车间就及时组织有关技术人员和工人开了几次专题会议，最后由搪床工人提出使用“自搪卡具”的建议，顺利地解决了这道工序的加工方法。
    专题会议不但及时地解决了许多试制、制造中临时发生的技术问题，同时也推动职工钻研技术，进一步提高技术水平。这个厂今年升级的四百二十七个工人中，有不少人是因积极参加专题会议而提高了技术的。积极参加专题会议的搪床工人高宝庆，在做车轴车床的“卡盘体”时，开始时要三十一个小时做一个，到后来就降到十小时三十分做一个。二车间的职工在开始试制六H一二立式铣床时，废品率曾高到百分之二十，但是到了第三季度，因为工人操作错误减少，废品率就降低到百分之一。  （新华社）
