    The Purchasing Power of the Working People is Constantly Increasing
    You. Gusev, Manager of the Frunze Department Store in Leningrad, USSR
    On Stalin Avenue in Leningrad is one of the largest department stores in the city. From morning till night, during business hours, people stream in and out of the doors of this five-story building, while countless crowds surge out. The only difference is that people go in empty-handed and come out with packages and boxes of all sizes. Many people wait for cars at the entrance because they can't carry what they've bought and need a car to transport it.
    Who are our customers? They are the makers of electric motors, the workers of the "Electric Power" factory, the shoemakers of the "Rapid Advance" and "Proletarian Victory" factories, the workers of the carriage manufacturing plant, the railway employees of the "October" railway line, and many other workers in the Frunze district of Leningrad.
    A simple inspection of the department store's operations makes it clear that thanks to the tireless care of the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet government, the material well-being of the Soviet people is constantly growing, and their purchasing power is increasing day by day. Our store has more and more goods every year, and prices are getting cheaper and cheaper. And the things the working people buy are also increasing year by year. As a result, the department store's turnover has almost tripled in the last five years.
    Not only has the sales volume of fabrics, shoes, and clothing increased, but the sales of non-essential items that beautify the lives of workers and help meet their cultural needs are also expanding rapidly.
    In the first nine months of this year alone, our department store sold 1,300 more radios than in the entire previous year, and nearly 2,000 cameras.
    More and more working people are using motorcycles and bicycles. The number of motorcycles and bicycles sold to residents has almost doubled in the past year.
    The Soviet people love music, singing, and dancing. Every family wants to have its own musical instruments and phonographs. This year we sold twice as many phonographs as in 1952, and three times as many accordions.
    In Leningrad, more than 300,000 square meters of housing are built every year. Many magnificent and well-equipped new houses and entire blocks have appeared on Stalin Avenue. Hundreds of employees have moved into these homes. Every family wants to furnish its new rooms with high-quality furniture and decorate them with works of art. Therefore, the furniture department of the department store is always so lively. Workers have purchased beautiful tables, wardrobes, sofas, dressing tables, and complete dining room and bedroom sets made of precious wood. From January to October, we sold more than 100 carloads of various furniture and more than 1.5 million rubles worth of exquisite art glassware: vases, water bottles, tableware, and cosmetic utensils.
    Workers are happy to buy art items such as gift boxes, which are decorated with exquisite paintings by famous folk painters Mstera, Palekh, and Fedoskino. The sales volume of these gift boxes has increased sixfold in our store in one year.
    The cash turnover in the jewelry and watch departments has increased from 270,000 rubles per month in 1952 to 650,000 rubles per month this year. "Star" and "Victory" brand women's watches are particularly popular here.
    In the three summer months alone, we sold millions of rubles worth of various appliances to reduce physical labor and facilitate daily life, such as vacuum cleaners, refrigerators, electric washing machines, and electric floor polishers.
    The store's cash registers collect more than two million rubles every day. This means that thousands of workers have bought new shoes and clothes, household goods, cultural items, and many other valuable items. This means that the Soviet people are living better, happier, and more prosperous lives.

    劳动人民的购买力不断提高
    苏联列宁格勒市伏龙芝百货商店经理　尤·古谢夫
    在列宁格勒的斯大林大街，有全市最大的百货商店之一。从早到晚，只要是营业时间，人们就川流不息地涌进这座五层楼大厦的大门，同时又有无数的人群迎面涌了出去。唯一的区别是：人们进去时是空着手，而出来时却带着大小纸包和纸匣。许多人在门口等汽车，因为买的东西拿不了，得用汽车装走。
    我们的顾客是些什么人呢？他们是电动机的制造者，“电力”工厂的劳动者，“快速行进”和“无产阶级胜利”工厂的制鞋工人，车厢制造厂的工人，“十月”铁路干线的铁路员工，以及列宁格勒市伏龙芝区的其他许多劳动者。
    只要巡视一下百货商店的工作，就会清楚地看到，由于苏联共产党和苏联政府不倦的关怀，苏联人民的物质福利正在不断增长，他们的购买力正在日益提高。我们商店的货物一年比一年多，价钱越来越便宜。而劳动人民购买的东西也一年比一年增加。因此，近五年来，百货商店的贸易额差不多增加了两倍。
    不仅是布匹、鞋子、服装的销售量增加了，就是那些用来美化劳动者的生活，帮助满足劳动者文化需要的非急需的物品的销路也在飞速地扩大。
  仅在今年的头九个月内，我们的百货商店卖出的收音机就比去年全年多一千三百架，并卖出了将近两千架照相机。
    劳动人民使用摩托车和脚踏车的愈来愈多了。最近一年来售给居民的摩托车和脚踏车几乎增加了一倍。
    苏联人民爱好音乐、歌唱和舞蹈。每个家庭都希望有自己的乐器以及留声机。今年我们售出的留声机比一九五二年多两倍，而手风琴则多三倍。
    在列宁格勒，每年都要修建三十多万平方公尺的住宅。斯大林大街出现了许多华丽的、设备完善的新住宅和整个街区。几百家职工搬进了这些住宅。每一家都要用上等家具布置新房间，用美术品点缀新房间。因此，百货商店的家具部经常是那样热闹。劳动者添置了用贵重木料制成的漂亮的桌子、衣橱、沙发、梳妆台，以及成套的餐厅设备和卧室设备。从一月到十月，我们卖出了一百多车皮的各式家具，一百五十多万卢布的精制美术玻璃器皿：花瓶、水瓶、食器和化妆用具等。
    劳动者很乐意买礼品盒之类的美术品，这些礼品盒上饰有著名的民间彩绘家姆斯杰拉、帕列赫和费多斯金诺的精致的绘画。这种礼品盒的销售量在我们这里一年之间增加了六倍。
    首饰部和钟表部的现金周转额从一九五二年的每月二十七万卢布增加为今年的每月六十五万卢布。“星”牌和“胜利”牌女手表在这里特别受欢迎。
    仅在夏季三个月里，我们就销售了价值数百万卢布的用来减轻体力劳动、便利日常生活的各种器具，如除尘器、冷藏器、电气洗衣机和电气擦地板机等。
    商店的收款处每天收款两百万卢布以上。这就是说，成千的劳动者买到了新鞋和新衣服、家常用品、文化用品和其他许多贵重物品。这就是说，苏联人民生活得愈来愈美好、愈幸福和愈富裕了。
