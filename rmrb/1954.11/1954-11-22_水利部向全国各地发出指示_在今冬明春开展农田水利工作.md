    Ministry of Water Resources Issues Directives Nationwide
    to Carry Out Farmland Water Conservancy Work This Winter and Next Spring
    (Xinhua News Agency, 21st) The Ministry of Water Resources of the People's Republic of China has issued instructions on carrying out farmland water conservancy work this winter and next spring.
    The instructions state: In order to further meet the growing needs of agricultural production, promote the development of the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement, strengthen drought and flood prevention capabilities, and create favorable conditions for increased agricultural production in 1955, all localities must seize the season this winter and next spring to continue to vigorously carry out farmland water conservancy work. In the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the Huai River basin, where some farmland water conservancy projects have been damaged due to the extraordinary floods, as well as other areas damaged by mountain floods and waterlogging, the original farmland water conservancy projects should be restored and repaired according to needs and the actual capabilities of the masses. Areas where water has not yet been drained should continue to organize the masses to drain water and extract as much land as possible for production. In general areas with conditions for developing water conservancy, various types of farmland water conservancy projects such as canals, ponds, dams, waterwheels, wells, small reservoirs, ditches, and terraced fields should be built in accordance with local conditions. Pumping stations should be established and developed according to the needs and possibilities of the region. Areas with existing foundations should pay attention to consolidation and steady development, while newly developed areas should focus on pilot projects, explore experience, and avoid blind construction and disuse; attention should also be paid to the combined use of irrigation and drainage to maximize their capacity. Soil and water conservation work should continue to be piloted in key areas, and should be promoted from point to surface in areas where experience has been gained. All localities should consolidate management organizations for existing irrigation facilities on the existing basis, improve water use systems, and specifically organize the masses to level the land, reduce the size of plots, improve irrigation technology, and continue to overcome the phenomenon of flooding and prevent soil salinization. Areas with winter irrigation habits and successful experiments should actively lead the masses to carry out winter irrigation; in areas without such habits, pilot projects should be carried out with emphasis, and irrigation experience should be summarized.
    The instructions also state: In order to complete the above tasks, all localities should pay attention to:
    (1) Relying on the unified leadership and unified arrangements of local Party and government organizations, seizing the opportunity and starting early. In particular, some provinces have a heavy task of damming breaches and restoring embankments, and they must, under the unified leadership of the local Party and government, make unified arrangements based on the specific circumstances of the task, labor force, and time, so as to avoid neglecting one thing and losing another, and failing to repair and affecting next year's production. In the southern regions, efforts should be made to organize winter construction, and projects that can be completed this winter should not wait until next spring. In the northern regions, efforts should be made to carry out some or most of the construction that can be done currently. All localities should also make good preparations for spring repairs by taking advantage of the winter slack season. (2) Relying on mutual aid and cooperative organizations to lead the broad masses and promote water conservancy work. Mutual aid and cooperative organizations should include water conservancy work as part of the agricultural production plan within the group and society. The facts of the past year have proved that all those who have carried out work in this way have smoothly carried out farmland water conservancy work, increased production, and consolidated and expanded mutual aid and cooperative organizations. (3) Widely publicize and earnestly implement the reward policies of more benefit, more burden; less benefit, less burden; and no benefit, no burden, as well as no increase in taxes for five years for dry land converted to paddy fields, so as to improve the enthusiasm of the masses in building water conservancy. Some areas have adopted methods such as distributing labor and earthwork according to the benefited acreage, evaluating work and recording points, clearing accounts after completion, exchanging labor for labor, exchanging earthwork for earthwork, or providing funds according to earthwork, which have widely absorbed the idle labor force during the slack season to actively participate in the construction work, overcome the difficulty of insufficient labor force for some benefited households, and accelerated the progress of the project, which can be promoted. The idea that some cadres are afraid of trouble and dare not earnestly implement policies is wrong and should be corrected. In preparing farmland water conservancy projects, attention should be paid to earnestly embodying the principle of saving labor, saving money, and achieving great results, with the masses raising funds and running the projects themselves as the main approach, and the government providing necessary loan assistance, and loans should be issued in a timely manner and used reasonably, correcting the tendency of equal distribution and simple reliance on loans. (4) Strengthen technical guidance, ensure project quality, and pay attention to construction safety. The established farmland water conservancy work teams and the trained farmer water conservancy technical personnel should strengthen organizational leadership and make full use of them, and train new forces through methods such as apprenticeships in key projects and short-term training. In project guidance, lessons should be well learned based on the damage to projects caused by this year's floods, necessary engineering equipment should be strengthened, and construction quality should be ensured. (5) Strengthen the specific organizational work of farmland water conservancy work.

    水利部向全国各地发出指示
    在今冬明春开展农田水利工作
    【新华社二十一日讯】中华人民共和国水利部发出关于开展今冬明春农田水利工作的指示。
    指示说：为了进一步满足日益增长的农业生产的需要，促进农村互助合作运动的发展，加强防旱防涝能力，给一九五五年的农业增产创造有利条件，各地必须抓紧今冬明春季节，继续大力开展农田水利工作。长江中、下游和淮河流域由于特大洪水，以及其他由于山洪、内涝部分农田水利工程遭受破坏的地区，应根据需要和群众实际能力，恢复和整修原有的农田水利工程。积水还没有排完地区应继续组织群众进行排水，尽可能地脱出土地进行生产。一般有发展水利条件的地区，应因地制宜地兴修渠道、塘坝、水车、水井、小型水库、沟洫、畦田等多种多样的农田水利工程。抽水机站应根据地区的需要和可能条件设立和发展，已有基础的地区应注意巩固和稳步发展，新发展地区应重点试办，摸索经验，避免盲目建立，设而不用；并应注意灌溉和排水的结合利用，以发挥更大能力。水土保持工作各地应继续重点试办，在已取得经验的地区应由点到面地进行推广。各地对已有灌溉设施，应在现有基础上整顿管理组织，健全用水制度，并具体组织群众进行平地打?，划小地块，提高灌溉技术，继续克服大水漫灌的现象，防止土壤盐碱化。有冬灌习惯及试验有成效的地区，应积极领导群众进行冬灌，在没有习惯的地区，应重点试行，并总结灌溉经验。
    指示又说：为了完成上述任务，各地应该注意：
    （一）依靠当地党政统一领导，统一安排，抓紧时机，及早动手。特别是有些省份堵口复堤的任务很大，必须在当地党政统一领导下，根据任务、劳力、时间等具体情况，统一安排，免得顾此失彼，不能修复而影响明年的生产。南方地区，要大力组织冬季施工，今冬能完成的工程不要等待明春。北方地区，当前能施工的争取施工一部或大部。各地并应利用冬闲作好春修准备工作。（二）依靠互助合作组织带动广大群众，推动水利工作。互助合作组织应把水利工作列为组内、社内农业生产计划的一部分。一年来的事实证明，凡是这样进行工作的，都顺利地开展了农田水利工作，提高了生产，巩固和扩大了互助合作组织。（三）广泛宣传并切实执行多受益多负担、少受益少负担、不受益不负担，以及旱田变水田五年内增产不增税的奖励政策，提高群众兴修水利的积极性。有些地区采用按受益田亩摊工摊方、评工记分、完工清账、以工换工、以方还方或按方给资等办法，广泛地吸收了农闲劳力积极参加兴修工作，克服了部分受益户劳力不足的困难，加快了工程的进展，可以推广。有些干部怕麻烦，而不敢认真贯彻政策的思想是不对的，应加纠正。在筹办农田水利工程时应注意认真体现省工省钱收效大的原则，以群众集资自办为主，政府作必要的贷款扶助，并应做到贷款及时发放，合理使用，纠正平均分配和单纯依赖贷款的偏向。（四）加强技术指导，保证工程质量，注意施工安全。已建立的农田水利工作队，和培养出的农民水利技术人材应加强组织领导，充分使用，并通过重点工程带徒弟、短期训练等办法培养新的力量。在工程指导上应根据今年洪水冲毁工程情况，很好地吸取教训，加强应有的工程设备，保证施工质量。（五）加强农田水利工作的具体的组织工作。
